WEBVTT

00:07.234 --> 00:08.334
Murray, did you just litter?

00:08.368 --> 00:09.702
Here's the way
I figure it.

00:09.736 --> 00:12.238
The more trash out there,
the more job security

00:12.272 --> 00:14.607
in here, right?
10-4 on that.

00:16.143 --> 00:17.476
(both laugh)

00:17.511 --> 00:19.145
Yo, yo, look out, look
out, look out, look out!

00:19.179 --> 00:20.379
(tires screech)

00:20.414 --> 00:22.515
Ah, it's just a
stupid raccoon.

00:22.549 --> 00:24.050
All right, get out there
and pick up the trash.

00:24.084 --> 00:25.084
Are you
kidding me?!

00:25.118 --> 00:26.385
You go out there!

00:26.420 --> 00:28.221
First of all,
that trash looks ripe.

00:28.255 --> 00:29.989
Second, raccoons
have rabies, man.

00:30.023 --> 00:30.990
Your mother has rabies.

00:31.024 --> 00:31.991
Your mother has rabies.

00:32.025 --> 00:33.659
Your mother has
the rabies.

00:33.694 --> 00:35.494
Sal, just drive
around the thing.

00:35.529 --> 00:37.063
I got a better idea.

00:37.097 --> 00:39.565
Let's see
what this thing can do.

00:44.638 --> 00:46.239
(laughs)

00:46.273 --> 00:47.373
(laughs)
Yeah, there you go!

00:47.407 --> 00:48.641
(whoops)

00:51.311 --> 00:53.546
(engine grinds, stops)

00:55.182 --> 00:56.649
So much for
job security.

00:56.683 --> 00:58.885
Relax, it's probably nothing.

00:58.919 --> 01:01.420
Let's check it out.

01:11.798 --> 01:13.399
(laughs)

01:13.433 --> 01:14.800
This is one of your stupid
practical jokes, right?

01:14.835 --> 01:16.302
Did Joan Q put you up to this?

01:16.336 --> 01:17.770
Dude...

01:17.804 --> 01:19.972
This is nice work.
This is your best prank yet.

01:20.007 --> 01:22.441
How'd you make the blood?
Is it corn syrup?

01:23.510 --> 01:26.212
Don't-don't...

01:26.246 --> 01:27.480
Tastes like metal.

01:27.514 --> 01:29.048
(gags, retches)

01:29.816 --> 01:31.017
(coughing)

01:31.051 --> 01:32.051
(laughs)

01:32.085 --> 01:33.853
Hurling. Nice touch.

01:35.555 --> 01:37.456
That's a good prank.

01:42.262 --> 01:45.598
Booth, I just got a text
from Cam about a potential...

01:45.632 --> 01:47.366
Wh-What are you doing?

01:47.401 --> 01:48.868
Oh, sorry about that.

01:48.902 --> 01:51.671
I was gonna surprise you,
but you know what, hey.

01:51.705 --> 01:53.973
I'm getting us a new TV.

01:54.007 --> 01:56.108
What, in the bedroom?
Yeah, so when the kids are watching

01:56.143 --> 01:58.344
<i>The Octopods</i> and the-- I don't
know what that show is--

01:58.378 --> 01:59.946
<i>The Spudnuts,</i>
<i>I'll tell you what,</i>

01:59.980 --> 02:03.249
I'll sit right here,
I can watch the game.

02:03.283 --> 02:06.552
Are you aware that couples with
a television in their bedroom

02:06.586 --> 02:07.920
have sex half as often

02:07.955 --> 02:09.889
as couples without
one in their bedroom?

02:09.923 --> 02:12.725
Yeah, well, did you know 73%
of people make up statistics?

02:12.759 --> 02:14.327
I haven't read that study.
Don't worry about it, Bones.

02:14.361 --> 02:16.529
Gonna be great.

02:16.563 --> 02:18.297
Watching the Philadelphia
Whosits play ice hockey

02:18.332 --> 02:19.765
is not a sexual
stimulant.

02:19.800 --> 02:21.767
And after games,
you're often exhausted

02:21.802 --> 02:23.936
from shouting at the umpire.
It's a referee.

02:23.971 --> 02:25.905
Well, not to mention your
bad mood when they lose.

02:25.939 --> 02:27.473
Yeah, but when
the Philadelphia Flyers win,

02:27.507 --> 02:28.808
when they score
and they win, okay,

02:28.842 --> 02:30.376
that puts me
in a very good mood,

02:30.410 --> 02:32.912
and that makes what I do there
that much better.

02:32.946 --> 02:34.113
Boom! Go, Flyers.

02:34.147 --> 02:35.815
What if the Whosits
have a losing season?

02:35.849 --> 02:37.583
N-N-N-Nuh. Don't even
put it out there.

02:37.617 --> 02:39.185
Don't even put it
out in the atmosphere.

02:39.219 --> 02:40.186
I'll tell you what.

02:40.220 --> 02:41.821
Tell you what I'm gonna do.

02:41.855 --> 02:45.224
I promise I'll make some,
uh, extra time for us.

02:45.258 --> 02:47.526
How much extra time?

02:47.561 --> 02:50.529
Hmm. As much as it takes.

02:50.564 --> 02:53.332
Oh, I suggest you
prove it right now.

02:53.367 --> 02:54.967
Oh, we got to get going.
Cam is...

02:55.002 --> 02:57.770
Oh, actually research has
shown that sexual activity

02:57.804 --> 03:01.741
increases neurogenesis
in the hippocampus.

03:01.775 --> 03:03.376
Wow, so sex is gonna
make us smarter

03:03.410 --> 03:04.777
and help us solve
the crime.

03:04.811 --> 03:05.611
Hello.

03:05.645 --> 03:07.880
(Brennan laughs)

03:14.821 --> 03:16.655
MONTENEGRO: Hey, I just got
a text from Brennan.

03:16.690 --> 03:19.291
She and Booth are gonna be
delayed by about 15 minutes.

03:19.326 --> 03:20.359
(phone chimes)

03:20.394 --> 03:23.162
Oh, or possibly another hour.

03:23.196 --> 03:24.563
SAROYAN:
Oh, it's just as well.

03:24.598 --> 03:26.065
It's gonna take us
at least that long

03:26.099 --> 03:27.867
to floss the remains
out of these brushes.

03:27.901 --> 03:29.869
Speaking of floss,
our victim had

03:29.903 --> 03:31.904
some super-high-quality veneers.

03:31.938 --> 03:33.606
HODGINS: Seeing almost
no insect activity,

03:33.640 --> 03:35.875
which means he was killed
less than 12 hours ago.

03:35.909 --> 03:39.845
SAROYAN: And it looks like
our victim had hair plugs.

03:39.880 --> 03:42.148
And based on the quality
of the skin grafting,

03:42.182 --> 03:43.983
I'm guessing he paid
a pretty penny for them.

03:44.017 --> 03:46.018
WARREN: Huh, you're lucky you
found that scalp still intact.

03:46.053 --> 03:49.388
I mean, this body is
seriously frakked up.

03:49.423 --> 03:50.890
"Frakked up"?

03:50.924 --> 03:52.758
Jessica's been
binge-watching <i>BSG</i> 2003.

03:52.793 --> 03:53.959
SAROYAN: Not to sound
like Dr. Brennan,

03:53.994 --> 03:55.327
but I don't know
what that means.

03:55.362 --> 03:57.430
<i>BSG. Battlestar Galactica.</i>

03:57.464 --> 03:58.931
What, you haven't
seen it?

03:58.965 --> 04:02.468
Wow, I'm surprised,
'cause it's totally old school,

04:02.502 --> 04:04.837
just like you.

04:05.739 --> 04:08.007
And also frakking enlightening.

04:08.041 --> 04:11.010
HODGINS: "Frak" is the curse
word they use on the show,

04:11.044 --> 04:13.245
but what's <i>really</i>
<i>frakking interesting</i>

04:13.280 --> 04:16.449
is that Aubrey told me he's been
watching <i>Battlestar</i> as well.

04:16.483 --> 04:18.350
Well, that's because
we're watching together.

04:18.385 --> 04:19.618
Oh, well, that is

04:19.653 --> 04:21.053
definitely interesting.

04:21.088 --> 04:23.055
Sounds to me like there's
a little something going on

04:23.090 --> 04:24.190
with you and Aubrey.

04:24.224 --> 04:26.892
Yes, television-watching.
And nothing else.

04:26.927 --> 04:30.062
Methinks the lady
doth protest too much.

04:30.097 --> 04:33.299
And methinks the victim
was a U.S. senator.

04:35.702 --> 04:37.436
Are you serious?

04:37.471 --> 04:39.638
HODGINS:
Can I see that?

04:44.244 --> 04:45.845
Yeah, Cam is right.

04:45.879 --> 04:48.314
This pin is meant to be worn
only by members of the Senate.

04:50.884 --> 04:52.918
Angela, we're gonna need
a facial reconstruction, ASAP.

04:52.953 --> 04:54.720
Okay, I'm way ahead of you.

04:54.754 --> 04:56.522
So we know there's a hundred
U.S. senators, right?

04:56.556 --> 04:58.958
Now we just
have to narrow it down.

04:58.992 --> 05:01.460
We know the victim was
a Caucasian male.

05:01.495 --> 05:04.230
Based on clothing size, he can't
be taller than five-eight.

05:04.264 --> 05:06.499
And based on the granularity
of the auricular surfaces,

05:06.533 --> 05:07.867
he was between
40 and 50 years old.

05:07.901 --> 05:09.635
HODGINS:
Also, he had blue eyes.

05:09.669 --> 05:10.636
with corrective lenses.

05:10.670 --> 05:12.138
How'd you know that, Curly?

05:15.008 --> 05:16.275
Ugh.

05:16.309 --> 05:19.145
MONTENEGRO: We've narrowed
it down-- three matches.

05:19.179 --> 05:20.980
And just one guy has
those picture-perfect veneers.

05:21.014 --> 05:24.150
MONTENEGRO: Well, looks like
our victim is Rick O'Malley.

05:24.184 --> 05:26.719
He's a first-term senator
from Virginia.

05:26.753 --> 05:28.521
SAROYAN:
I'd better call Booth.

05:28.555 --> 05:29.955
I have a bad feeling

05:29.990 --> 05:32.224
this case is gonna be
a frakking nightmare.

<i>Was</i> a member

06:12.681 --> 06:14.615
The use of the present
tense is inaccurate

06:14.649 --> 06:17.852
now that Senator O'Malley
has been killed, dismembered,

06:17.886 --> 06:19.453
scavenged by a raccoon

06:19.488 --> 06:22.283
and shredded by a three-ton
industrial street sweeper.

06:22.383 --> 06:23.650
Under no circumstances

06:23.684 --> 06:25.252
is she going with you

Okay, I'll tell you what,
I'll make this easy.

06:27.188 --> 06:28.822
I'll go, and I-I'll take Aubrey,

06:28.856 --> 06:30.323
What? No, no,
no, no, no, no.

06:30.358 --> 06:32.726
I've been present
for hundreds of notifications.

06:32.760 --> 06:36.296
Dr. Brennan, do you have any
idea how delicate this case is?

06:36.330 --> 06:40.267
And to be perfectly frank, you
lack a certain je Ne sais quoi.

06:40.301 --> 06:43.837
Well, "je Ne sais quoi" is by
definition an ineffable quality.

06:43.871 --> 06:45.372
If you could provide

06:45.406 --> 06:47.173
a more clear criticism,

06:47.208 --> 06:49.276
I'm sure I could make
the appropriate change.

06:49.310 --> 06:51.311
Oh, come on, Bones, you know
what she's talking about.

06:51.345 --> 06:53.146
Well, not always,
you have a tendency to say

06:53.180 --> 06:54.948
the exact wrong thing
at the worst possible moment.

06:54.982 --> 06:56.583
BRENNAN:
And then other times,

06:56.617 --> 06:58.051
I say exactly what is needed.

06:58.085 --> 07:00.954
Like this morning when
I skillfully negotiated sex,

07:00.988 --> 07:02.322
not just once

07:02.356 --> 07:03.356
but twice.

07:03.391 --> 07:04.925
God bless you, child.

07:04.959 --> 07:07.327
I couldn't have proven
my point better myself.

07:07.361 --> 07:09.162
(whispering): Know what,
it was three times.

07:09.196 --> 07:11.097
(sighs)

07:12.266 --> 07:14.267
AUBREY: I can't believe
the victim is Rick O'Malley.

07:14.302 --> 07:15.702
BOOTH:
Oh, you know him?

07:15.736 --> 07:17.570
I don't <i>know him</i> know him,
but I follow the news.

07:17.605 --> 07:18.772
O'Malley was different.

07:18.806 --> 07:19.906
Before his time in the Senate,

07:19.941 --> 07:21.041
he worked mostly
blue-collar jobs.

07:21.075 --> 07:22.142
Yeah, he was the
general manager

07:22.176 --> 07:24.177
for a coal mining company.

07:24.211 --> 07:26.179
Look, you're not the only one
who reads the file, you know.

07:26.213 --> 07:28.048
I-I'm just saying
that he wasn't

07:28.082 --> 07:29.816
one of these
career politicians.

07:29.850 --> 07:31.184
He was a throwback.

07:31.218 --> 07:33.586
A  <i>Mr. Smith Goes to Washington,</i>
<i>if you will.</i>

07:33.621 --> 07:34.888
And I kind of dig that.

07:34.922 --> 07:36.690
I mean, aren't you sick
of these politicians

07:36.724 --> 07:37.964
who are just
out for themselves?

07:37.992 --> 07:39.459
Clearly not as sick as you.

07:39.493 --> 07:41.428
Well, I just think
it's inspiring that the guy

07:41.462 --> 07:43.563
actually cared
about his constituents.

07:43.597 --> 07:47.534
Oh. Sounds like maybe Mr. Aubrey
should go to Washington.

07:47.568 --> 07:49.102
That's the plan.

07:49.136 --> 07:51.071
Not this election cycle,
of course,

07:51.105 --> 07:52.272
but there's a seat
opening in 2020.

07:52.306 --> 07:53.807
(chuckles):
Wow, wow, okay.

07:53.841 --> 07:55.809
You're... you're serious.

07:55.843 --> 07:57.677
So you got, like, what,
a five-year plan?

07:57.712 --> 07:59.012
It's more like ten years.

07:59.046 --> 08:01.147
But something I've been
eyeing for a while.

08:01.182 --> 08:04.317
"Congressman Aubrey."

08:04.352 --> 08:05.618
Senator.
Oh.

08:05.653 --> 08:07.654
Yeah, don't
shortchange me, man.

08:07.688 --> 08:09.689
Right, Mr. Senator.

08:14.028 --> 08:16.830
Good news is,
at a minimum,

08:16.864 --> 08:19.032
I'll be able to run
a tox screen

08:19.066 --> 08:21.568
and check for his last meal,
'cause the stomach is...

08:21.602 --> 08:23.603
more or less intact.

08:23.637 --> 08:24.904
I'd say less, not more.

08:24.939 --> 08:25.939
WARREN:
Here.

08:25.973 --> 08:27.841
It appears to be
the right femur.

08:27.875 --> 08:29.376
HODGINS: This case is
a first for me.

08:29.410 --> 08:31.845
I've never actually worked
on someone that I voted for.

08:31.879 --> 08:34.481
You voted for a Democrat?
SAROYAN: You sound surprised.

08:34.515 --> 08:37.082
I thought
Dr. Hodgins was a member of

08:37.118 --> 08:39.452
the Green Party like myself.
HODGINS: Yeah, I used to be,

08:39.486 --> 08:41.988
but then I figured
why not vote for a candidate

08:42.023 --> 08:44.491
who at least has
a shot at winning.

08:44.525 --> 08:46.793
I myself am a proud member
of the Peace and Freedom Party.

08:46.827 --> 08:48.595
Yeah, there's
a vote that counts.

08:48.629 --> 08:50.230
BRENNAN: Miss Warren,
uh, please take a look

08:50.264 --> 08:53.633
at the V-shaped cleft on

08:53.667 --> 08:54.934
the right proximal femur.

08:54.969 --> 08:56.636
WARREN:
The kerf mark suggests

08:56.670 --> 08:59.072
that it was an ax or hatchet
rather than a saw.

08:59.106 --> 09:00.573
SAROYAN:
I concur.

09:00.608 --> 09:02.642
The dismemberment cuts
I've found on the flesh

09:02.676 --> 09:05.745
were definitely caused by an ax,
albeit one with a dull edge.

09:05.780 --> 09:06.780
Well, great.

09:06.814 --> 09:08.915
We have our motive.

09:08.949 --> 09:10.417
The killer had an ax to grind.

09:13.287 --> 09:15.288
(reporters murmuring)

09:15.322 --> 09:17.323
BOOTH: Great. Press
is already here.

09:17.358 --> 09:20.060
Remind me to tell Caroline
there's a leak at the Bureau.

09:20.094 --> 09:21.728
Are you the FBI?
Was Senator O'Malley murdered?

09:21.762 --> 09:23.196
Was this some kind of a
political retribution?

09:23.230 --> 09:24.764
All right, you want to back off?

09:24.799 --> 09:26.199
This is official FBI business.

09:26.233 --> 09:28.201
No, damn it, I told you before.

09:28.235 --> 09:31.104
No press statements
without prior approval.

09:31.138 --> 09:33.440
I don't care
if Diane Sawyer is calling.

09:33.474 --> 09:34.941
No.

09:34.975 --> 09:36.376
Mrs. O'Malley?

09:36.410 --> 09:38.745
I'm Special Agent Booth.
This here is Agent Aubrey.

09:38.779 --> 09:40.413
We're sorry
that the news got out

09:40.448 --> 09:41.815
before we could come
tell you in person.

09:41.849 --> 09:42.916
Oh, it's not
your fault.

09:42.950 --> 09:44.784
Nothing in our lives
has been private

09:44.819 --> 09:46.252
ever since Rick took office.

09:46.287 --> 09:48.822
Why should his death
be any different?

09:48.856 --> 09:50.367
So living in the public eye
was pretty difficult?

09:50.391 --> 09:51.558
It has been.

09:51.559 --> 09:55.195
Uh, but public service was
very important to both of us.

09:55.229 --> 09:57.797
Rick and I grew up
in Buchanan County.

09:57.832 --> 10:00.400
And the whole reason he
went into politics was

10:00.434 --> 10:03.603
to try to save as many
local jobs as possible.

10:03.637 --> 10:05.405
You mean coal mining.

10:05.439 --> 10:07.574
MRS. O'MALLEY: That's right.
Yeah, most of the folks we knew

10:07.608 --> 10:09.809
had at least one family member
in the tunnels.

10:09.844 --> 10:12.178
Judging by all these awards,

10:12.213 --> 10:14.714
it looks like your husband's
fighting spirit

10:14.748 --> 10:16.116
was appreciated.

10:16.150 --> 10:18.451
Rick was nothing short
of a revelation.

10:18.486 --> 10:20.854
Eric Morales, Rick's
chief of staff.

10:20.888 --> 10:22.188
BOOTH: We'll have to ask
both of you--

10:22.223 --> 10:24.324
when was the last time
you, uh, saw the senator?

10:24.358 --> 10:26.493
Wednesday afternoon at the office.
Yesterday morning.

10:26.527 --> 10:29.162
Uh, I had to go to UVA
to deliver a speech.

10:29.196 --> 10:30.497
I stayed the night
in Charlottesville.

10:30.531 --> 10:33.233
And then when I got
home this morning,

10:33.267 --> 10:35.235
I just figured
he was at work.

10:35.269 --> 10:37.237
I never would
have thought...

10:37.271 --> 10:38.905
AUBREY:
What about enemies?

10:38.939 --> 10:42.075
I imagine even the most beloved
politicians receive threats.

10:42.109 --> 10:43.676
MORALES: Generally
speaking, Rick was

10:43.711 --> 10:45.478
one of the more popular
of the freshman senators.

10:45.513 --> 10:47.347
He had his choice of committees.

10:47.381 --> 10:49.415
But you're right, there were
some unhappy constituents.

10:49.450 --> 10:52.385
I'd be more than willing to
turn over any e-mails or letters

10:52.419 --> 10:53.720
that we got at the office.

10:53.754 --> 10:55.755
So have you noticed anything
out of the ordinary?

10:55.789 --> 10:58.191
What was the senator's,
I don't know, state of mind

10:58.225 --> 11:00.226
in the past few days?

11:00.261 --> 11:04.164
I hate to say it,
but recently Rick has been...

11:04.198 --> 11:06.466
aloof, at least with me.

11:06.500 --> 11:08.902
He's been receiving phone calls
at all hours

11:08.936 --> 11:10.470
from the party's whip.

11:10.504 --> 11:12.605
And by party's whip,
you mean Senator Hayley Winters?

11:12.640 --> 11:13.973
That's right.

11:14.008 --> 11:16.442
Look, I love my husband,

11:16.477 --> 11:19.045
and I would not want
to make accusations,

11:19.079 --> 11:20.713
especially now, but...

11:20.748 --> 11:22.582
BOOTH: But you-you were
suspicious he was

11:22.616 --> 11:23.945
having an affair
with Senator Winters.

11:23.969 --> 11:25.218
MORALES: No.

11:25.219 --> 11:27.053
No, of course they weren't.
He was always with her.

11:27.087 --> 11:28.588
Even last night.

11:28.622 --> 11:32.358
They were supposedly
at some fund-raiser together.

11:34.951 --> 11:37.386
Seeley Booth, I never thought
the day would come

11:37.486 --> 11:40.354
when even glancing at those
chiseled features of yours

11:40.374 --> 11:41.908
would set me off.
Come on.

11:41.942 --> 11:43.876
The whip may have been
the last person who has seen

11:43.911 --> 11:44.844
Senator O'Malley alive.

11:44.878 --> 11:46.345
I have to talk to her.

11:46.380 --> 11:47.513
Cher, there is no way

11:47.548 --> 11:50.216
in H-E-double-hockey-sticks

11:50.250 --> 11:52.084
I am allowing you to haul
the Senate majority whip

11:52.119 --> 11:56.189
into the FBI without
any evidence of her involvement.

11:57.858 --> 11:59.892
(chuckles): Look, Caroline...
No, no, no, no.

11:59.927 --> 12:02.829
Don't try to convince me
with those sweet dulcet tones.

12:02.863 --> 12:05.031
We call in the whip,

12:05.065 --> 12:06.766
and the Justice Department
becomes fodder

12:06.800 --> 12:08.801
for Sunday Morning talk shows,
and, <i>cher,</i>

12:08.836 --> 12:10.336
that is not
how I plan to make

12:10.370 --> 12:11.904
my first appearance
on   <i>Meet the Press.</i>

12:11.939 --> 12:14.073
Good news.
You brought me an antacid.

12:14.107 --> 12:15.741
I just got off the phone
with the whip's office.

12:15.776 --> 12:17.410
Senator Winters wants Booth

12:17.444 --> 12:19.645
down on Capitol Hill ASAP
to brief her on the case.

12:19.680 --> 12:21.848
I swear you are blessed
by the Almighty himself.

12:21.882 --> 12:23.216
Okay, great.
You ready to saddle up?

12:23.250 --> 12:25.818
Actually, uh,
Winters requested Dr. Brennan.

12:25.853 --> 12:27.119
I guess she used
to be a doctor,

12:27.154 --> 12:28.688
wants to hear the forensic
side of the case.

12:28.722 --> 12:29.689
Holy mother of pearl,

12:29.723 --> 12:31.224
just bring me the whole bottle

12:31.258 --> 12:32.592
of antacids right now.

12:32.626 --> 12:33.960
Your wife doesn't know
the meaning

12:33.994 --> 12:35.728
of "playing politics."
BOOTH: Relax, okay?

12:35.762 --> 12:37.897
I will handle Bones.
Bones will be fine, okay?

12:37.931 --> 12:39.699
And if you have a whole bottle
of antacids,

12:39.733 --> 12:41.200
your stomach's gonna blow up,
all right?

12:41.235 --> 12:43.195
"H-E-double-hockey-sticks"?
What the hell is that?

12:45.539 --> 12:46.672
Now, just what are you doing

12:46.707 --> 12:48.574
while those two mess up
in Congress?

12:48.609 --> 12:49.809
Why do I sense

12:49.843 --> 12:51.244
that you're about to tell me?

12:51.278 --> 12:53.513
That ginger-haired
squintern girl in the lab.

12:53.547 --> 12:54.747
Jessica? What about her?

12:54.781 --> 12:57.049
Justice wants you to run
a background check on her

12:57.084 --> 12:59.685
to make sure she's clear to work
on such a high-profile case.

12:59.720 --> 13:01.454
I'm on it, but don't worry.

13:01.488 --> 13:05.258
I know Jessica.
I'm not gonna find anything.

13:05.292 --> 13:08.394
My thought is the victim tried
to fend off his attacker.

13:08.428 --> 13:11.898
Please tell me this isn't
just one of your vibes talking.

13:11.932 --> 13:13.599
Oh, no, instinct
and evidence.

13:13.634 --> 13:15.268
They are singing
in perfect harmony.

13:15.302 --> 13:17.603
Note the spider-web
fractures on the ulna.

13:17.638 --> 13:18.804
SAROYAN:
Ouch.

13:18.839 --> 13:20.206
Looks like the senator

13:20.240 --> 13:22.675
was trying to defend himself,
and the killer hit him

13:22.709 --> 13:25.478
with a long, flat,
blunt force weapon.

13:25.512 --> 13:27.680
Any idea what it was?
Not yet,

13:27.714 --> 13:30.182
but I also found
hemorrhagic staining

13:30.217 --> 13:31.851
on the right side
of the maxilla.

13:31.885 --> 13:33.619
So a blow to the head.

13:33.654 --> 13:36.789
I haven't pieced the skull
together yet, but hopefully

13:36.823 --> 13:37.790
that'll tell us more.

13:37.824 --> 13:39.659
Well, then work quickly.

13:39.693 --> 13:41.060
You should try to find
cause of death

13:41.094 --> 13:42.495
before Dr. Brennan gets back.

13:42.529 --> 13:44.363
Aye-aye, captain.

13:47.234 --> 13:50.303
BRENNAN: <i>Booth, I know</i>
<i>Caroline is concerned</i>

13:50.337 --> 13:53.573
because I don't play politics,
so I want to assure you

13:53.607 --> 13:54.807
that I will be
on my best behavior.

13:54.841 --> 13:55.775
I hope not.

13:55.809 --> 13:56.976
Excuse me?

13:57.010 --> 13:58.811
Look, I just want
you to be you.

13:58.845 --> 14:00.680
You know, you,
your usual, wonderful,

14:00.714 --> 14:02.148
but very direct self.

14:02.182 --> 14:03.683
And what if I say something

14:03.717 --> 14:04.884
that could be misconstrued
as offensive?

14:04.918 --> 14:06.385
Yeah, you will.

14:06.420 --> 14:08.020
And that's exactly
what I'm counting on.

14:08.055 --> 14:09.789
You see,
because then Winters will react,

14:09.823 --> 14:11.390
and I'll get a read on her.

14:11.425 --> 14:12.959
Oh, very clever.

14:12.993 --> 14:16.062
So I should think of this
as an undercover assignment,

14:16.096 --> 14:17.997
but you want me to play myself.

14:18.031 --> 14:19.298
You're overthinking this.

14:19.333 --> 14:21.500
I could play
a slight variation on myself.

14:21.535 --> 14:22.802
I could be saucy.

14:22.836 --> 14:25.237
Or I could
speak with an accent.

14:25.272 --> 14:26.038
No, Bones.

14:26.073 --> 14:27.707
Don't-don't do that.

14:27.741 --> 14:29.208
Just-just be you.
That's all I need.

14:29.242 --> 14:31.010
I just want you to be you.
That's all I need.

14:31.044 --> 14:33.846
Oh, okay. I'm just saying.

14:33.880 --> 14:35.548
(imitating Humphrey Bogart):
This could be the start

14:35.582 --> 14:37.049
of a beautiful friendship.

14:37.084 --> 14:40.252
Really? You're gonna go
with Bogart?

14:40.287 --> 14:42.121
Well, I got over-excited,
but you have to admit,

14:42.155 --> 14:44.323
that's an excellent
impersonation.

14:47.527 --> 14:48.728
This is such a tragic day.

14:48.762 --> 14:50.997
Rick was a dear, dear man.

14:51.031 --> 14:53.265
I want you to know you have
the full power of my office

14:53.300 --> 14:54.667
behind you
during the investigation.

14:54.701 --> 14:56.102
Well, that is very
sensible of you,

14:56.136 --> 14:58.237
particularly if we
discover that the crime

14:58.271 --> 15:00.206
involved any other
members of your party.

15:00.240 --> 15:02.208
BOOTH: I think what my
partner here is trying to say

15:02.242 --> 15:04.777
is that politicians like
to get ahead of the problem,

15:04.811 --> 15:07.179
before it kind of blows up
in their faces.

15:07.214 --> 15:08.247
Indeed.

15:08.281 --> 15:09.582
Naturally, it also behooves you

15:09.616 --> 15:11.684
to prepare the necessary lie
for the public.

15:11.718 --> 15:12.952
BOOTH: Speaking of
which, is that

15:12.986 --> 15:14.353
the, uh, damage control room
in there?

15:14.388 --> 15:17.056
WINTERS: No, actually,
my aides are rushing

15:17.090 --> 15:19.425
to prepare a bill
to increase the debt ceiling.

15:19.459 --> 15:22.495
Last thing we need
is another government shutdown.

15:22.529 --> 15:24.463
It must be quite difficult
for your staff to put

15:24.498 --> 15:26.532
all that into their work,
knowing it is unlikely

15:26.566 --> 15:29.969
for any senator to actually
read it before a vote.

15:30.003 --> 15:33.272
I must ask if we could return
to the investigation.

15:33.306 --> 15:35.007
Sure, let's back it up a bit,
Bones, you know.

15:35.042 --> 15:36.142
I find myself
quite curious

15:36.176 --> 15:38.077
as to how you plan
to spin the fact

15:38.111 --> 15:39.679
that Senator O'Malley
was hacked to pieces.

15:39.713 --> 15:41.380
So you're saying

15:41.415 --> 15:43.649
Rick was dismembered?
What's interesting

15:43.684 --> 15:45.017
is the placement
of the hack marks.

15:45.052 --> 15:46.619
As a former surgeon,

15:46.653 --> 15:50.122
you know it is ideal to
cut along the joints.

15:50.157 --> 15:52.091
Killer didn't do that.
He chopped all over the place.

15:52.125 --> 15:55.795
So whoever did this is likely
ignorant of human anatomy.

15:55.829 --> 15:57.863
Or the killer is cunning

15:57.898 --> 16:01.367
and is trying to mislead
the investigation.

16:03.236 --> 16:06.539
Perhaps we should bring
this discussion into my office.

16:06.573 --> 16:07.540
Great idea.

16:07.574 --> 16:09.108
(quietly):
Good job, Bones.

16:12.179 --> 16:13.345
Hey.

16:13.380 --> 16:15.881
Oh, hey.

16:15.916 --> 16:18.217
Is that for me?
Oh, yes.

16:18.251 --> 16:21.120
I sure as hell am not drinking
any catnip tea.

16:21.154 --> 16:22.688
Wow, you remembered my drink.

16:22.723 --> 16:24.023
It's definitely
an acquired taste,

16:24.057 --> 16:26.625
but I guess that sums me up
in a nutshell, too.

16:26.660 --> 16:28.828
So... uh, so what's up?

16:28.862 --> 16:32.231
Oh, um, well, Caroline asked me
to clear you for the case,

16:32.265 --> 16:33.799
so I had to run
a background check.

16:33.834 --> 16:37.203
Is this about the time
I peed at the Lincoln Memorial?

16:37.237 --> 16:39.605
Because I had a terrible UTI
that day.

16:39.639 --> 16:40.840
Um, no.

16:40.874 --> 16:43.642
Somehow that detail
was left out.

16:43.677 --> 16:45.444
But...

16:45.479 --> 16:48.948
were you involved with
Greenpeace in college?

16:48.982 --> 16:50.282
Yeah, so?

16:50.317 --> 16:53.219
So you were engaged
with an activist group

16:53.253 --> 16:54.720
known for its
aggressive tactics.

16:54.755 --> 16:57.256
Now, is that you in the crowd?

16:57.290 --> 16:58.023
Mm-hmm.

16:58.058 --> 16:59.992
Look, brillo-head,

17:00.026 --> 17:01.761
you're getting me
kind of nervous here.

17:01.795 --> 17:04.696
So were you present five minutes
after this photo was taken

17:04.731 --> 17:07.366
when a pipe bomb exploded
outside of the building?

17:07.400 --> 17:09.068
Greenpeace had nothing
to do with that,

17:09.102 --> 17:10.703
and neither did I.

17:10.737 --> 17:11.804
We were the victims.

17:11.838 --> 17:13.405
Just check the police reports.

17:13.440 --> 17:15.141
Okay. And then
what about

17:15.175 --> 17:17.943
when you were on the road
with the band Phish?

17:17.978 --> 17:19.612
There were no bombs there.

17:19.646 --> 17:20.746
Yeah, there were drugs.

17:20.781 --> 17:22.414
I know. I had a great time.

17:22.449 --> 17:23.715
Um...

17:23.750 --> 17:25.151
but that was then.

17:25.185 --> 17:26.551
What are you saying?

17:26.586 --> 17:28.454
That my past is gonna
ruin my future?

17:28.488 --> 17:31.490
Okay, so just to be clear,
you-you don't do drugs anymore?

17:31.525 --> 17:33.125
I haven't in a while,

17:33.160 --> 17:36.095
but that doesn't mean
I'm never gonna do them again.

17:36.129 --> 17:38.664
Uh, I never say never.

17:38.698 --> 17:40.699
(sighs)

17:41.768 --> 17:43.569
Everything okay?
Yeah.

17:43.603 --> 17:45.371
Yeah, no, I'm just
trying to figure out

17:45.405 --> 17:47.573
how to report this
back to Caroline.

17:47.607 --> 17:50.276
You could just... not.

17:50.310 --> 17:53.746
I mean, everything in that file
is in the before.

17:53.780 --> 17:55.915
I am who I am
because of my past,

17:55.949 --> 17:58.784
but I'm not
the same person anymore.

17:58.819 --> 18:00.419
Are you the same kid

18:00.453 --> 18:03.489
who watched his dad
being hauled off to jail?

18:03.523 --> 18:05.624
No.

18:06.660 --> 18:08.661
So?

18:09.796 --> 18:11.730
Hey, stop that.

18:11.765 --> 18:14.166
You don't get to look at me
all disappointed like that.

18:14.201 --> 18:15.201
No, I'm not,

18:15.235 --> 18:16.335
I'm not disappointed.

18:16.369 --> 18:19.205
I'm-I'm just, um...

18:19.239 --> 18:22.107
Can we just forget
this conversation ever happened?

18:22.142 --> 18:23.809
I don't know.

18:23.844 --> 18:26.145
Can you?

18:28.415 --> 18:30.683
BOOTH: <i>So, O'Malley's chief</i>
<i>of staff said that you had</i>

18:30.717 --> 18:32.318
frequent meetings
with the senator.

18:32.352 --> 18:34.019
His wife also said
that you called him

18:34.054 --> 18:35.988
at all hours of
the day and night.

18:36.022 --> 18:37.523
That's right. I like to maintain

18:37.557 --> 18:39.191
a close working relationship
with freshman senators.

18:39.226 --> 18:41.694
"Working" relationship?

18:41.728 --> 18:42.962
What are you implying?

18:42.996 --> 18:44.430
As you undoubtedly know,

18:44.464 --> 18:48.200
political figures often use
their positions of power

18:48.235 --> 18:50.870
to circumvent
conventional mores

18:50.904 --> 18:52.371
and engage
in extramarital affairs.

18:52.405 --> 18:54.173
Well, I'm flattered
that you think

18:54.207 --> 18:55.841
that I have the stamina
for an affair,

18:55.876 --> 18:57.743
but I assure you,
there was nothing between us.

18:57.777 --> 18:59.545
Right, and yet you were
at the fund-raiser

18:59.579 --> 19:00.880
with him last night, correct?

19:00.914 --> 19:02.348
I mean, that was the last place

19:02.382 --> 19:03.649
he was seen.
You don't think someone

19:03.683 --> 19:05.084
from the fund-raiser
murdered him?

19:05.118 --> 19:06.819
I don't know,
why don't you tell me.

19:06.853 --> 19:08.020
I mean, this is politics.

19:08.054 --> 19:09.722
Somebody must have
a grudge against him.

19:09.756 --> 19:10.923
Not within the party.

19:10.957 --> 19:12.958
Still, I'm happy to provide you

19:12.993 --> 19:14.526
with the guest list.

19:15.595 --> 19:17.363
Actually, now that
I think about it,

19:17.397 --> 19:18.797
there was an incident.

19:18.832 --> 19:21.066
This handful
of protestors.

19:21.101 --> 19:23.302
The security had
them removed,

19:23.336 --> 19:25.771
but I remember
Rick seeming unnerved.

19:25.805 --> 19:27.373
He left shortly after.

19:27.407 --> 19:29.174
You think the two events
are connected?

19:29.209 --> 19:31.377
It's possible.

19:31.411 --> 19:32.678
What were the protests against?

19:32.712 --> 19:34.280
An amendment to the
debt ceiling bill.

19:34.314 --> 19:36.615
One that hit Rick
pretty close to home.

19:36.650 --> 19:38.651
It's an order
to reduce coal emissions.

19:38.685 --> 19:39.618
O'Malley's platform

19:39.653 --> 19:41.687
was in support
of coal miners.

19:41.721 --> 19:44.523
So why would the protestors
make him a target?

19:44.557 --> 19:48.193
Because Rick was going to vote
in favor of the bill,

19:48.228 --> 19:49.194
despite the
added measure.

19:49.229 --> 19:50.629
And let me guess,
you're the one

19:50.664 --> 19:52.898
who persuaded him
to vote against his conscience.

19:52.933 --> 19:55.768
Sometimes, Agent Booth,

19:55.802 --> 20:00.005
we all have to make sacrifices
for the sake of the party.

20:02.342 --> 20:04.410
HODGINS:
Hey.

20:04.444 --> 20:05.878
Wanted to see me?

20:05.912 --> 20:07.980
Yeah, Booth called.

20:08.014 --> 20:10.516
Apparently, Senator O'Malley
left the fund-raising dinner

20:10.550 --> 20:12.851
before the actual meal
was served.

20:12.886 --> 20:14.486
You want me to do
some digestive diving,

20:14.521 --> 20:15.587
figure out what he ate?

20:15.622 --> 20:17.156
Yeah, maybe we
can figure out

20:17.190 --> 20:18.324
where he dined on his last meal.

20:18.358 --> 20:20.092
Looks like some kind of poultry.

20:20.126 --> 20:22.094
It's gamier than chicken.

20:22.128 --> 20:24.330
I don't know, possibly quail?

20:24.364 --> 20:26.131
Okay, whatever you guys
are working on,

20:26.166 --> 20:27.933
I do not want
to know about it.

20:27.968 --> 20:29.668
What do you got?
So I was able

20:29.703 --> 20:31.570
to get surveillance video
from outside the building

20:31.604 --> 20:35.107
where the fund-raising
event was held.

20:35.141 --> 20:37.810
Is that Senator
O'Malley?

20:37.844 --> 20:39.011
Pixilation is terrible.

20:39.045 --> 20:40.679
Like an '80s video game.

20:40.714 --> 20:43.882
Yeah, and here
comes Donkey Kong.

20:43.917 --> 20:45.284
HODGINS:
Whoa.

20:45.318 --> 20:46.919
Kong looks pissed.

20:46.953 --> 20:48.787
It's hard to see his face.

20:48.822 --> 20:51.490
Yeah, the quality is bad,
but I think it's safe to say

20:51.524 --> 20:53.525
that this guy is
angry enough to kill.

20:59.432 --> 21:01.567
So, did you do your homework

21:01.601 --> 21:02.801
on that Jessica
Warren creature,

21:02.836 --> 21:04.770
or do I need to
rap your knuckles?

21:04.804 --> 21:05.838
I did it.

21:05.872 --> 21:07.840
She's got some skeletons
in her closet,

21:07.874 --> 21:11.176
but then again, she is
a forensic anthropologist.

21:11.211 --> 21:12.244
Cute.

21:12.278 --> 21:14.046
You know how much I love cute.

21:14.080 --> 21:15.481
She's good to go.

21:15.515 --> 21:17.716
Uh, nothing serious enough
to warrant a mistrial.

21:17.751 --> 21:19.451
But I think
you already knew that.

21:19.486 --> 21:22.388
Look, <i>cher,</i>
<i>I'm just trying to make sure</i>

21:22.422 --> 21:24.823
you've got both eyes wide open.

21:24.858 --> 21:27.059
You have a bright future
ahead of you.

21:27.093 --> 21:28.560
But first you need
to find yourself

21:28.595 --> 21:29.895
the right kind
of woman.

21:29.929 --> 21:31.163
You asking me out?

21:31.197 --> 21:32.831
<i>Cher,</i> you couldn't handle me.

21:32.866 --> 21:34.266
(chuckles)

21:34.300 --> 21:35.634
Look, I appreciate
everything you're doing,

21:35.668 --> 21:38.237
but I promise you
there's nothing going on

21:38.271 --> 21:39.638
between me and Jessica.

21:39.672 --> 21:41.407
Good. Now, where are we at?

21:41.441 --> 21:43.442
Angela found footage
of this behemoth

21:43.476 --> 21:45.077
arguing with the senator
last night.

21:45.111 --> 21:47.312
Problem is,
the quality is so bad,

21:47.347 --> 21:49.681
she can't run it
through facial recognition.

21:49.716 --> 21:51.383
No need.

21:51.418 --> 21:53.185
I'd recognize that man
in the dark

21:53.219 --> 21:55.487
with my pretty little eyes
blindfolded.

21:55.522 --> 21:57.556
You got a name?
Frankie Cesari.

21:57.590 --> 21:59.758
Wait, why does that
sound familiar?

21:59.793 --> 22:01.293
Cesari's the
unofficial president

22:01.327 --> 22:03.128
of the coal mining
lobby in Virginia.

22:03.163 --> 22:04.496
You watch out for yourself.

22:04.531 --> 22:06.465
I wouldn't put
anything past that man.

22:06.499 --> 22:08.734
Not after he evaded
my embezzling charges

22:08.768 --> 22:10.369
by disappearing
his accuser.

22:10.403 --> 22:11.403
"Disappearing"?

22:11.438 --> 22:12.871
Body was never found.

22:12.906 --> 22:15.908
Good chance the fellow
has cement feet.

22:15.942 --> 22:17.943
Disposing of the victim
fits our killer's M.O.

22:17.977 --> 22:18.977
Exactly.

22:19.012 --> 22:20.379
So, you do me a favor.

22:20.413 --> 22:23.482
Make sure you nail
the slimeball to the wall.

22:23.516 --> 22:26.085
I'll tell you what.

22:26.119 --> 22:28.320
I'll let you do it with me.

22:37.031 --> 22:39.357
Well, look what
the trash dragged in.

22:39.457 --> 22:40.245
What-what the hell?

22:40.246 --> 22:41.313
This is entrapment.

22:41.347 --> 22:42.314
Entrapment?

22:42.348 --> 22:43.415
(scoffs):
Oh.

22:43.449 --> 22:44.950
It is a damn
shame, Frankie,

22:44.984 --> 22:46.985
that a dictionary doesn't
come with that mouth.

22:47.019 --> 22:47.986
Sit down, please.

22:48.020 --> 22:49.487
Thank you.

22:49.522 --> 22:51.056
So, we've got
some video of you

22:51.090 --> 22:52.757
getting into
a pretty heated argument

22:52.792 --> 22:54.426
with Senator O'Malley
last night.

22:54.460 --> 22:55.627
So what?

22:55.661 --> 22:57.128
It's a free country.

22:57.163 --> 22:59.030
And I got the right
to petition my legislators.

22:59.065 --> 23:01.333
But what you don't have
is the right to kill him.

23:01.367 --> 23:02.767
Oh, come on.

23:02.802 --> 23:05.670
You guys think I killed him?

23:05.705 --> 23:07.872
I'm a businessman.
All we ever did was talk!

23:07.907 --> 23:10.809
Okay, so what did you
talk about last night?

23:10.843 --> 23:12.143
The debt ceiling bill.

23:12.178 --> 23:14.446
I just asked him
how he was planning to vote.

23:14.480 --> 23:15.747
CAROLINE: Looked to
me like you were

23:15.781 --> 23:16.848
none too pleased
with his answer.

23:16.882 --> 23:18.083
AUBREY:
What did you do?

23:18.117 --> 23:19.617
Followed him
after the fund-raiser?

23:19.652 --> 23:21.886
Beat on him until
he saw things your way?

23:21.921 --> 23:23.421
Wow. You guys should be writers

23:23.456 --> 23:25.256
the way you come up
with these stories.

23:25.291 --> 23:26.491
None of the above, actually.

23:26.525 --> 23:28.293
O'Malley said

23:28.327 --> 23:29.494
he was undecided.

23:29.528 --> 23:30.729
CAROLINE:
And you believed him?

23:30.763 --> 23:32.397
Ah, Frankie,
you are even dumber

23:32.431 --> 23:33.832
than you are ugly.

23:33.866 --> 23:35.467
Of course I didn't believe him.

23:35.501 --> 23:36.868
That's why I went home

23:36.902 --> 23:38.503
and started working
on a picket line.

23:38.537 --> 23:39.971
I got phone records
and everything

23:40.006 --> 23:41.406
to prove it.

23:41.440 --> 23:43.041
So what?

23:43.075 --> 23:45.010
So you gonna admit you were
wrong? You gonna let me go?

23:45.044 --> 23:47.078
Soon as your alibi
checks out, yeah.

23:47.113 --> 23:49.447
Of course, that
could take a while.

23:49.482 --> 23:51.249
I were you,
I'd get cozy.

23:51.283 --> 23:53.084
Hey, hey, hey,
you can't keep me in here.

23:53.119 --> 23:54.986
That's illegal.
Come on, Frankie.

23:55.021 --> 23:56.721
You never let
the law get in your way.

23:56.756 --> 23:57.989
Why start now?

24:01.694 --> 24:03.461
WARREN:
<i>Hey.</i>

24:03.496 --> 24:06.664
I've reassembled the skull, and
it is ready for its close-up.

24:06.699 --> 24:08.733
Impressive.
Given the damage inflicted,

24:08.768 --> 24:11.169
I thought this would've
taken you much longer.

24:11.203 --> 24:12.504
Yeah, well, I find that

24:12.538 --> 24:14.672
when I'm feeling
emotionally unstable,

24:14.707 --> 24:17.375
concentrating on my work
helps me to cope.

24:17.410 --> 24:19.244
Like I said,
this is very good work.

24:19.278 --> 24:22.480
Okay, if she's not gonna
take that bait, I will.

24:22.515 --> 24:23.982
What's the problem?

24:24.016 --> 24:28.219
Uh, well, technically,
there is no actual problem,

24:28.254 --> 24:29.894
because there's nothing
actually going on.

24:29.922 --> 24:31.556
But there is potential.

24:31.590 --> 24:32.857
And I don't think
you just squash potential

24:32.892 --> 24:34.459
until there is
an actual problem.

24:34.493 --> 24:35.827
BRENNAN:
I did not understand

24:35.861 --> 24:37.262
a word you just said.

24:37.296 --> 24:38.363
Don't worry, I'm with you.

24:38.397 --> 24:39.497
I mean, just because something

24:39.532 --> 24:40.598
is unlikely to be successful--

24:40.633 --> 24:42.500
like, say a relationship--

24:42.535 --> 24:44.569
doesn't mean
you don't try, right?

24:44.603 --> 24:46.571
BRENNAN:
I disagree.

24:46.605 --> 24:48.406
If you know
the likelihood of an outcome

24:48.441 --> 24:52.577
is statistically unfavorable,
that thing should be avoided.

24:52.611 --> 24:54.312
Like a TV in the bedroom.

24:54.346 --> 24:56.281
Okay, now I don't know
what you're saying.

24:56.315 --> 24:57.982
Oh, um,

24:58.017 --> 25:00.218
Booth wants a TV in the bedroom,
but Brennan doesn't

25:00.252 --> 25:02.487
because she heard
that statistically

25:02.521 --> 25:04.756
it's less likely
she'll have sex.

25:04.790 --> 25:06.758
I find it is safer to adhere
to the percentages.

25:06.792 --> 25:08.226
Yeah, but it's
also boring.

25:08.260 --> 25:11.496
I mean, sometimes
the best things in life

25:11.530 --> 25:13.298
happen against the odds.

25:13.332 --> 25:15.934
Think about anything
you've ever really wanted.

25:15.968 --> 25:18.703
Right?
Like a perfect job or-or...

25:18.737 --> 25:20.638
finding the love of your life.

25:20.673 --> 25:22.607
Those are one-in-a-million
chances, right?

25:22.641 --> 25:24.442
But for you,

25:24.477 --> 25:25.810
the odds don't even apply

25:25.845 --> 25:28.146
until you're both clear
about what you want.

25:28.180 --> 25:29.481
Thank you, Angela.

25:29.515 --> 25:31.249
That was, like,
the best talk/monologue

25:31.283 --> 25:32.817
I've ever been part of.

25:34.120 --> 25:36.421
As to the injuries
to the victim's skull?

25:36.455 --> 25:37.489
Oh, yes.

25:37.523 --> 25:38.890
Check out the damage

25:38.924 --> 25:41.960
on the right zygomatic,
mandible and maxilla.

25:41.994 --> 25:43.962
These fractures
are perimortem.

25:43.996 --> 25:46.164
The damage is
suggestive of

25:46.198 --> 25:48.099
a blunt force weapon
with an uneven surface,

25:48.134 --> 25:50.468
at least 12 centimeters
in diameter.

25:50.503 --> 25:53.138
What, like a big rock?

25:53.172 --> 25:55.039
Which is not at all like
the straight-edge weapon

25:55.074 --> 25:56.274
used to fracture
the ulna.

25:56.308 --> 25:57.876
So, multiple weapons.

25:57.910 --> 25:59.277
Perhaps multiple killers.

25:59.311 --> 26:01.379
Hey, so I just finished
my analysis of the food

26:01.413 --> 26:02.881
in Senator O'Malley's stomach.

26:02.915 --> 26:05.517
Turns out, the guy's
last meal was pigeon.

26:05.551 --> 26:06.584
Ew!

26:06.619 --> 26:08.186
Was he hanging out with hobos?

26:08.220 --> 26:11.422
Either that or Granny Clampett
picked up some roadkill.

26:11.457 --> 26:12.757
I-I don't know what that means.

26:12.791 --> 26:14.792
But several
Far Eastern cultures

26:14.827 --> 26:18.630
consider pigeon--
particularly pigeon heads--

26:18.664 --> 26:20.865
to be delicacies.

26:20.900 --> 26:22.901
But how many Far Eastern
restaurants in the D.C. area

26:22.935 --> 26:24.235
actually serve pigeon?

26:24.270 --> 26:25.537
I do not know.

26:25.571 --> 26:29.707
However, I believe Agent Aubrey
is quite knowledgeable

26:29.742 --> 26:31.776
when it comes to
local cuisine.

26:32.811 --> 26:35.046
Perhaps you could
call him and ask.

26:35.080 --> 26:37.315
I figured out
who you were talking about.

26:44.990 --> 26:46.824
How you doing,
chickadee?

26:46.859 --> 26:48.459
For an Internet-
based society,

26:48.494 --> 26:51.896
D.C. sure seems to be stuck
in the trees-killing era.

26:51.931 --> 26:53.898
That all O'Malley's?
Yep.

26:53.933 --> 26:55.567
Guy is clean as a whistle.

26:55.601 --> 26:57.268
Except... this.

26:57.303 --> 26:59.470
It's a copy of his personal
financial statements

26:59.505 --> 27:01.105
dating back three years.

27:01.140 --> 27:02.941
Now, you see that
withdrawal for two G's?

27:02.975 --> 27:04.209
Staring me right in the face.

27:04.243 --> 27:05.510
That's a recurring
withdrawal.

27:05.544 --> 27:06.911
Always for $2,000.

27:06.946 --> 27:08.646
Always the same time
of the month.

27:08.681 --> 27:09.914
Sounds like drugs,
you ask me.

27:09.949 --> 27:11.449
Well, according to Cam,

27:11.483 --> 27:12.784
his tox report was negative,

27:12.818 --> 27:14.819
so I'm leaning towards
prostitutes.

27:14.853 --> 27:16.087
So maybe the wife was right

27:16.121 --> 27:17.689
and her husband
was having an affair.

27:17.723 --> 27:19.157
Just not with
Senator Winters.

27:19.191 --> 27:21.025
My thoughts exactly.
So I tracked down the cab driver

27:21.060 --> 27:23.194
that picked O'Malley up
from the fund-raising dinner.

27:23.229 --> 27:25.230
He said that he, uh,

27:25.264 --> 27:27.932
dropped O'Malley off at some
Indonesian restaurant downtown.

27:27.967 --> 27:29.534
Where he met his lover.

27:29.568 --> 27:31.269
Cabbie remembers seeing

27:31.303 --> 27:33.905
a young woman embracing O'Malley
outside of the restaurant,

27:33.939 --> 27:37.542
which incidentally serves
the best pigeon in town.

27:37.576 --> 27:39.777
Ew.

27:39.812 --> 27:41.312
(groans)

27:41.347 --> 27:42.647
Oh, what's that smell?

27:42.681 --> 27:44.048
Oh, that would be durian,

27:44.083 --> 27:45.984
referred to in Indonesia
as the king of fruit,

27:46.018 --> 27:47.819
frequently added to sayur.

27:47.853 --> 27:48.987
Remind me to get
some to take home.

27:49.021 --> 27:50.588
So our home can
smell like a foot.

27:50.623 --> 27:52.991
I mean, who needs a TV to get
in the way of our sex life

27:53.025 --> 27:54.926
when we have foot smell, right?

27:54.960 --> 27:56.794
Table for two?
No.

27:56.829 --> 27:58.162
FBI.
We have A-rating for clean.

27:58.197 --> 27:59.797
You could see!
That's great.

27:59.832 --> 28:01.666
You know what?
I'm not interested.

28:01.700 --> 28:03.701
You know him?
Ah, Rick.

28:03.736 --> 28:06.604
Kind man.
He have big appetite.

28:06.639 --> 28:08.973
Good tipper.
Why? He in trouble?

28:09.008 --> 28:10.475
When was the last time you saw him?
Yesterday.

28:10.509 --> 28:12.744
Nighttime.
He good friend with waitress.

28:12.778 --> 28:14.045
Well, that could be
his lover, Booth.

28:14.079 --> 28:15.947
Great, okay.
Is she working here tonight?

28:15.981 --> 28:18.182
You not hurt her?

28:18.217 --> 28:21.386
I just want
to talk to her, okay?

28:21.420 --> 28:23.154
Anissa!

28:24.957 --> 28:26.924
BRENNAN: Booth?
BOOTH: Yeah?

28:26.959 --> 28:28.726
I don't think
Senator O'Malley

28:28.761 --> 28:30.762
was having an affair
with that woman.

28:30.796 --> 28:32.130
BOOTH:
Why's that?

28:32.164 --> 28:33.331
BRENNAN: Based on the
pronounced zygomatics,

28:33.365 --> 28:35.700
the high orbital
ridge of her face,

28:35.734 --> 28:38.336
I'm quite confident
that this is

28:38.370 --> 28:41.005
Senator O'Malley's
daughter.

28:46.656 --> 28:48.431
Rick O'Malley is
my biological father.

28:48.456 --> 28:50.256
Is something wrong?
Is he in trouble?

28:50.356 --> 28:52.924
Biological father?
So, you were adopted?

28:52.958 --> 28:54.959
Him and my mom
had a one-night stand.

28:54.994 --> 28:57.429
I didn't know who he was
until four years ago.

28:57.463 --> 28:58.697
And when you turned 18,

28:58.731 --> 29:00.398
you could legally obtain
your birth record.

29:00.433 --> 29:02.233
Yeah.
BRENNAN: I imagine

29:02.268 --> 29:05.036
that you would be upset
that your father abandoned you

29:05.071 --> 29:06.504
for your entire
childhood.

29:06.539 --> 29:07.806
That would be hard
on any child,

29:07.840 --> 29:09.908
no matter what their age.
No.

29:09.942 --> 29:11.342
I mean, sure,
I-I wondered about him.

29:11.377 --> 29:12.844
But, I don't know,
it was never a thing.

29:12.878 --> 29:14.312
And when you found out

29:14.346 --> 29:16.915
he was a senator,
you saw there was opportunity.

29:16.949 --> 29:19.117
Excuse me?
BRENNAN: We know Senator O'Malley

29:19.151 --> 29:22.153
withdrew $2,000 monthly
from his bank account.

29:22.188 --> 29:24.556
We can only assume he
made those same deposits

29:24.590 --> 29:25.724
into your account.

29:25.758 --> 29:27.125
So, I mean, what happened?

29:27.159 --> 29:29.294
Did you threaten to tell
the press that he had

29:29.328 --> 29:31.162
an illegitimate daughter
if he didn't pay?

29:31.197 --> 29:33.665
No, no. He was just helping me
with college like a dad does.

29:33.699 --> 29:35.300
I don't buy it.
I mean, if he really

29:35.334 --> 29:37.602
supported you, why didn't
you make a public statement?

29:37.636 --> 29:38.870
Because I asked him
not to.

29:38.904 --> 29:40.271
The first time
that he ran for Senate,

29:40.306 --> 29:42.006
he asked me to be
a part of the campaign,

29:42.041 --> 29:44.042
but I didn't want to be
some D.C. scandal.

29:44.076 --> 29:46.444
Didn't he tell you all of this?
Why are you here?

29:48.380 --> 29:51.082
I take it you haven't been
watching the news?

29:51.117 --> 29:53.384
No, I've been
in class all day. Why?

29:53.419 --> 29:54.753
I'm sorry to tell you,

29:54.787 --> 29:56.467
but your-your father
was killed last night.

29:58.891 --> 30:00.859
No, no, no, no.

30:00.893 --> 30:02.127
(stammers)
He-he couldn't have been.

30:02.161 --> 30:04.863
I just, I was with...
I just saw...

30:04.897 --> 30:06.264
Last night,
you were with him,

30:06.298 --> 30:09.167
and as far as we know,
from what we can gather,

30:09.201 --> 30:10.902
you were the last person
who saw him alive.

30:10.936 --> 30:13.905
So, what?
You think I killed him?

30:13.939 --> 30:16.007
No. No, no, no, no.

30:16.041 --> 30:17.976
He-he came here all the time.

30:18.010 --> 30:19.611
It wasn't out of the ordinary.

30:19.645 --> 30:20.912
We would

30:20.946 --> 30:22.680
sit and-and eat
and talk.

30:22.715 --> 30:24.449
And what about
last night?

30:24.483 --> 30:25.784
Um...

30:25.818 --> 30:27.252
He was upset.

30:27.286 --> 30:29.788
He-he said something about
a vote, that the party

30:29.822 --> 30:31.990
was making him vote
a way he didn't want to.

30:32.024 --> 30:34.292
Did he say what he was
intending to do?

30:34.326 --> 30:35.293
No, just...

30:35.327 --> 30:38.596
I-I told him
to follow his heart.

30:40.166 --> 30:42.333
Okay, and what time
did he leave?

30:42.368 --> 30:45.804
Um, I-I drove him home,
around 11:00.

30:45.838 --> 30:48.673
The last time I saw him,
he was...

30:48.707 --> 30:50.909
he was headed inside.

30:55.080 --> 30:57.582
See this abrasion
on the left temporal?

30:57.616 --> 30:59.250
Here?

30:59.285 --> 31:02.120
That is directly behind
where the ear would be.

31:02.154 --> 31:03.388
I took a measurement.

31:03.422 --> 31:05.957
It has the same radius
as a 31-gauge needle.

31:05.991 --> 31:08.193
Makes sense-- an ideal
place to poison someone

31:08.227 --> 31:11.729
is behind the ear because
a coroner seldom looks there.

31:11.764 --> 31:13.665
But the tox screen
came back negative.

31:13.699 --> 31:15.333
Well, I have
a thought on that.

31:15.367 --> 31:18.469
What if the killer first
tried to poison O'Malley,

31:18.504 --> 31:21.072
make it look like he died
of natural causes?

31:21.106 --> 31:22.507
But then he fought back,

31:22.541 --> 31:24.409
causing the needle
to scrape along the skull

31:24.443 --> 31:25.810
before being torn out.

31:25.845 --> 31:27.812
Exactly. Her first method
of murder failing,

31:27.847 --> 31:29.547
the killer
turned to a more

31:29.582 --> 31:30.682
brutal means to end things.

31:30.716 --> 31:31.816
"Her"?

31:31.851 --> 31:33.151
Poison is a murder weapon

31:33.185 --> 31:35.153
most often used by women.

31:35.187 --> 31:39.023
Although, I think I'm more of
a flamethrower kind of gal.

31:39.058 --> 31:41.226
Well, it's important
to have flair.

31:41.260 --> 31:42.427
You know it.

31:42.461 --> 31:44.095
Have Hodgins swab the abrasion;
maybe he can

31:44.129 --> 31:45.929
figure out what type of poison
was being used.

31:47.499 --> 31:50.201
Statistically, women are
five times more likely

31:50.236 --> 31:52.437
than men to use poison
as a murder weapon.

31:52.471 --> 31:54.572
So, playing the odds,
leaves us the wife,

31:54.607 --> 31:57.108
the illegitimate child
and the majority whip.

31:57.142 --> 32:00.245
If this case isn't D.C.,
I don't know what is.

32:00.279 --> 32:01.546
I had my money on the whip.

32:01.580 --> 32:03.214
She was a doctor
before she came to politics.

32:03.249 --> 32:06.050
She'd have the easiest access
to poison and needles.

32:06.085 --> 32:07.619
If you ask me,

32:07.653 --> 32:10.221
I'd guess the wife, except for
that pesky alibi of hers.

32:10.256 --> 32:13.224
Except... she doesn't have one.

32:13.259 --> 32:14.826
I talked to the manager
of the hotel

32:14.860 --> 32:17.161
where she stayed near UVA.

32:17.196 --> 32:20.298
No one saw her or heard from her
between 10:00 p.m. and 7:00 a.m.

32:20.332 --> 32:21.933
Plenty of time
to drive home,

32:21.967 --> 32:25.069
kill the senator,
then return to the hotel.

32:25.104 --> 32:27.639
Also, Lynette O'Malley
is a diabetic.

32:27.673 --> 32:30.675
And guess what size needle
her pharmacy says she uses?

32:30.709 --> 32:32.543
31-gauge?
Bingo.

32:32.578 --> 32:34.746
Same size that the squints found
on the victim's skull.

32:34.780 --> 32:36.014
Okay, I'm convinced.

32:36.048 --> 32:37.515
I'll get a warrant
for the house.

32:37.549 --> 32:39.651
You get Booth and
get over there now.

32:42.154 --> 32:44.088
BOOTH:
<i>Once we get to the house,</i>

32:44.123 --> 32:45.657
just let me do all the
talking, you understand?

32:45.691 --> 32:49.027
(scoffs) Gee, thanks, Dad,
but I can handle myself.

32:49.061 --> 32:51.029
All right, look, Aubrey,
I know you know what to do.

32:51.063 --> 32:53.298
But I'm just saying, if
you're serious about getting

32:53.332 --> 32:55.833
into politics one day, you
just, you have to be careful

32:55.868 --> 32:57.735
about what you say, Aubrey.
Okay.

32:57.770 --> 32:59.704
I'll hang back.
Good, all right.

32:59.738 --> 33:01.572
(phone rings)
Bones, what is it?

33:01.607 --> 33:04.242
Hodgins found traces of a poison
called Succinylcholine

33:04.276 --> 33:05.910
on the abrasion to the skull.

33:05.945 --> 33:08.246
I think I've heard
of that stuff.

33:08.280 --> 33:09.681
It is often considered

33:09.715 --> 33:11.316
an ideal homicidal poison

33:11.350 --> 33:13.584
because its half-life
is exceptionally short,

33:13.619 --> 33:17.455
meaning the body
metabolizes it so rapidly,

33:17.489 --> 33:19.190
it would be untraceable
in the blood.

33:19.224 --> 33:20.792
Well, that's why the tox screen
came back negative.

33:20.826 --> 33:22.060
Precisely.

33:22.094 --> 33:24.495
Maybe I'm being hopeful,
but the ideal homicidal poison--

33:24.530 --> 33:28.032
I'm guessing that stuff isn't
sold in the local drugstore.

33:28.067 --> 33:29.400
No. However, it is
common to hospitals

33:29.435 --> 33:31.169
because of its use
as a paralytic.

33:31.203 --> 33:32.570
BOOTH: You know who has
admitting privileges

33:32.604 --> 33:34.172
at D.C. West Hospital?

33:34.206 --> 33:37.175
Majority whip. Senator Winters.

33:37.209 --> 33:39.677
(indistinct chatter)

33:42.381 --> 33:44.849
Okay, great. Is it me or
does it just look like

33:44.883 --> 33:46.651
there's more of them
here than before?

33:46.685 --> 33:49.253
Looks like a press conference.
I'm telling you, right?

33:49.288 --> 33:50.588
Agent Booth, can we ask you
some questions?

33:50.622 --> 33:52.290
Does the FBI have
a suspect in custody?

33:52.324 --> 33:55.426
Is that the announcement
you're gonna be making today?

33:56.829 --> 33:58.663
Agent Booth, has there been
some sort of development

33:58.697 --> 34:00.465
in my husband's case?
Sorry, what's going on here?

34:00.499 --> 34:02.200
Looks like you're about to make
a statement to the press.

34:02.234 --> 34:04.002
AUBREY: I'd remind you this is
an ongoing investigation,

34:04.036 --> 34:05.837
and there is information
that we are not yet

34:05.871 --> 34:07.472
releasing to the public.
No, I promise

34:07.506 --> 34:09.273
the announcement has nothing
to do with the investigation.

34:09.308 --> 34:10.608
MORALES:
Governor Doland will be

34:10.641 --> 34:12.777
arriving shortly
to announce his invocation

34:12.811 --> 34:15.346
of the Widow's Mandate.
What are you talking about?

34:15.380 --> 34:16.947
When a senator dies
while in office,

34:16.982 --> 34:19.784
it falls to the governor
to appoint a replacement

34:19.818 --> 34:21.018
for the remainder
of the term.

34:21.053 --> 34:22.453
Historically,
governors have

34:22.487 --> 34:24.222
selected a
lawmaker's widow,

34:24.255 --> 34:26.224
as she's most likely to share
his political ideology.

34:26.257 --> 34:29.060
So, what? He's gonna
appoint her now? Today?

34:29.094 --> 34:30.360
That is his intention.
AUBREY: No. No.

34:30.396 --> 34:31.996
Th-That's motive, okay?
Cancel the press conference.

34:32.031 --> 34:34.264
Aubrey, just back down.
I got this.

34:34.299 --> 34:36.400
We need to ask you
a few questions, Mrs. O'Malley.

34:36.435 --> 34:37.668
WINTERS:
No.

34:37.703 --> 34:38.803
Lynette, don't say a word.

34:38.837 --> 34:39.937
You're out of line.

34:39.972 --> 34:41.205
Have a seat, Senator.

34:41.239 --> 34:43.408
I got a couple questions
for you, as well.

34:47.730 --> 34:50.344
Uh. I've been back and forth
over these remains like

34:50.344 --> 34:52.780
a kabillion times,
and I'm not seeing anything new.

34:52.840 --> 34:54.688
Ms. Warren,
you need to calm yourself.

34:54.789 --> 34:55.989
I know, but
Booth and Aubrey

34:56.024 --> 34:57.825
are holding
Senator Winters

34:57.859 --> 34:59.726
and Lynette O'Malley
until we find something.

34:59.761 --> 35:00.994
I thought you were
more focused

35:01.029 --> 35:02.696
when feeling
emotionally unstable.

35:02.730 --> 35:03.897
What can I say?

35:03.932 --> 35:05.165
Angela's pep talk worked.

35:05.200 --> 35:06.700
Emotionally,
I'm as fit as a fiddle,

35:06.734 --> 35:08.235
which means my focus

35:08.269 --> 35:10.804
is a little fidgety.

35:10.839 --> 35:13.507
What about this nick
near the coracoid process

35:13.541 --> 35:15.676
inside the glenoid cavity?
It's in my notes.

35:15.710 --> 35:17.344
It's a hack mark
from the dismemberment.

35:17.378 --> 35:19.079
I don't think so.

35:19.114 --> 35:21.415
Note the hemorrhagic staining
inside the wound.

35:21.449 --> 35:23.584
Its location suggests

35:23.618 --> 35:26.787
the subclavian artery
was likely penetrated,

35:26.821 --> 35:28.355
causing the victim
to bleed out.

35:28.389 --> 35:29.623
So sharp force trauma--

35:29.657 --> 35:31.558
on top of the two distinct

35:31.593 --> 35:34.261
blunt force injuries
we found earlier.

35:34.295 --> 35:36.330
That's three weapons in all.

35:36.364 --> 35:38.765
Note the blue staining
deep inside the nick.

35:38.800 --> 35:40.534
Uh, so, what?

35:40.568 --> 35:42.102
Most of the bones were stained

35:42.137 --> 35:43.777
when they went through
the street sweeper.

35:43.805 --> 35:46.039
True. However, the blue
inside this wound

35:46.074 --> 35:48.408
is too deep to have been left
by the street sweeper.

35:48.443 --> 35:50.410
So he was killed
with a paintbrush?

35:50.445 --> 35:51.812
I need to talk
to Angela.

35:51.846 --> 35:53.881
My gut tells me

35:53.915 --> 35:55.549
we're not looking at
three separate weapons.

35:55.583 --> 35:56.884
Your gut?

35:56.918 --> 35:58.785
Well, it's a vibe. (chuckles)

35:58.820 --> 36:02.156
There's a time and a place,
Ms. Warren.

36:04.359 --> 36:06.460
Agent Aubrey,
so far I've heard no evidence

36:06.494 --> 36:07.995
that should stop
the governor

36:08.029 --> 36:09.530
moving forward with
his appointment.

36:09.564 --> 36:10.697
I need to know,

36:10.732 --> 36:12.199
was there anyone,
anyone at all,

36:12.233 --> 36:13.823
that can corroborate that
you were at the hotel?

36:13.847 --> 36:14.501
No.

36:14.502 --> 36:16.670
I was exhausted and I passed out
the minute I got to the room.

36:16.704 --> 36:19.239
You don't even have proof the
the senator was killed at home.

36:19.274 --> 36:20.908
BOOTH: Ah, look what I found
in the garage, huh?

36:20.942 --> 36:24.678
Same size that was used
to chop up the body.

36:24.712 --> 36:26.813
AUBREY:
Looks like we found your proof.

36:28.650 --> 36:29.816
BRENNAN:
<i>We know the victim was struck</i>

36:29.851 --> 36:32.719
by three seemingly
disparate objects.

36:32.754 --> 36:34.354
The first is a sharp

36:34.389 --> 36:35.756
V-shaped cleft.

36:35.790 --> 36:37.124
The second injury

36:37.158 --> 36:40.827
was the result of
a long, hard, flat surface

36:40.862 --> 36:43.163
striking the ulna.
Yeah. Well, whatever it is,

36:43.198 --> 36:45.465
it measures at least
20 centimeters.

36:45.500 --> 36:48.402
The third injury was caused
by an uneven, rocky surface.

36:48.436 --> 36:50.437
The blow
to the side of the face.

36:50.471 --> 36:51.638
The perimortem damage

36:51.673 --> 36:53.907
was just under
eight centimeters.

36:56.311 --> 36:57.778
I don't see it.

36:57.812 --> 37:01.415
Each of these shapes
is completely distinct.

37:01.449 --> 37:03.016
Angela,

37:03.051 --> 37:05.919
position the rocky surface
on top,

37:05.954 --> 37:08.755
rotating it 180 degrees.

37:10.058 --> 37:12.359
Now position the flat edge

37:12.393 --> 37:14.461
several inches below
that, horizontally,

37:14.495 --> 37:17.497
with the sharp force trauma
outline to the left of that.

37:18.499 --> 37:19.933
Wait a second.

37:19.968 --> 37:22.035
Why does that look familiar?
Because you live in it.

37:22.070 --> 37:24.705
That is the great
Commonwealth of Virginia.

37:24.739 --> 37:25.906
Oh.

37:25.940 --> 37:28.675
Well, how can a state
be a murder weapon?

37:28.710 --> 37:31.011
Well, unless the state
of Virginia is composed of coal, it's not.

37:31.045 --> 37:32.846
What did you find?
The blue you saw in the stab wound

37:32.880 --> 37:34.781
is the result
of petrified coal.

37:34.816 --> 37:36.850
It can turn organic
tissue blue.

37:36.884 --> 37:38.885
I need to call Booth.

37:38.920 --> 37:40.020
This is ridiculous.

37:40.054 --> 37:41.755
The press is literally
on our doorstep.

37:41.789 --> 37:43.223
Relax. Like
Agent Aubrey said,

37:43.258 --> 37:45.425
this is an ongoing
investigation.

37:45.460 --> 37:47.761
(phone rings) They can't release any
information to the public.

37:47.795 --> 37:49.096
Bones, what do you got?

37:49.130 --> 37:50.631
BRENNAN:
The murder weapon is

37:50.665 --> 37:53.000
a statue or an award
or something

37:53.034 --> 37:54.568
in the shape of Virginia.

37:54.602 --> 37:56.103
It's made of petrified coal.

37:56.137 --> 37:57.537
Hold on.

37:57.572 --> 37:58.672
Hold on.

37:58.706 --> 38:00.474
Booth, what are you looking for?

38:02.510 --> 38:03.977
BOOTH:
This.

38:05.280 --> 38:06.313
Okay.

38:06.347 --> 38:07.581
Bones, I got it.

38:07.615 --> 38:08.949
(sniffs)

38:08.983 --> 38:10.584
There's only one problem.
It smells like bleach.

38:10.618 --> 38:12.719
We're not gonna be able to find
any blood evidence on it.

38:12.754 --> 38:13.954
We don't need it.

38:13.988 --> 38:16.723
You see the rough edge
of the statue?

38:16.758 --> 38:18.258
The northernmost part
of the state?

38:18.293 --> 38:19.826
Bones, just tell me what
I'm looking for here, okay?

38:19.861 --> 38:21.028
The killer must have used

38:21.062 --> 38:22.963
extreme force when
striking the victim.

38:22.997 --> 38:24.364
If the murder weapon

38:24.399 --> 38:26.066
was held by that side,

38:26.100 --> 38:27.701
it is likely
she cut herself on it.

38:27.735 --> 38:29.102
Okay, so you're saying
there was a cut

38:29.137 --> 38:30.170
on the killer's hand?

38:30.204 --> 38:31.605
There's a very good chance

38:31.639 --> 38:34.107
that the coal stained the tissue

38:34.142 --> 38:35.909
at the site of the cut.

38:35.943 --> 38:38.312
Look for blue discoloration.

38:38.346 --> 38:39.680
Got it. Thanks.

38:39.714 --> 38:41.048
Okay, break it up, let's go.

38:41.082 --> 38:42.516
I need to see the palms
of both your hands.

38:42.550 --> 38:44.851
Why? I demand to know
what you're looking for.

38:44.886 --> 38:46.453
Put your palms out.

38:49.657 --> 38:51.291
(sighs)

38:52.760 --> 38:54.328
BOOTH:
No blue.

38:55.196 --> 38:57.564
No blue.

38:57.598 --> 38:59.366
Mr. Morales.

38:59.400 --> 39:01.401
Let's see the palms
of your hands, please.

39:01.436 --> 39:03.070
I don't even know
what this is about.

39:03.104 --> 39:05.105
It's about you following
simple directions.

39:05.139 --> 39:07.074
Now do what the man said.

39:12.613 --> 39:13.613
Look at that.

39:13.648 --> 39:15.415
Blue.

39:18.486 --> 39:20.320
Eric?

39:21.622 --> 39:23.924
You two were having an affair.

39:23.958 --> 39:25.158
MORALES:
I'm sorry, Lynette.

39:25.193 --> 39:28.295
I swear to you,
she had nothing to do with this.

39:28.329 --> 39:30.263
Rick was gonna vote
against the party.

39:30.298 --> 39:33.066
I tried to tell him, but no.
He's just so damn stubborn.

39:33.101 --> 39:34.935
He was gonna ruin
our future, for what?

39:34.969 --> 39:36.770
A handful of jobs?
I couldn't let that happen.

39:36.804 --> 39:38.438
You knew about
the Widow's Mandate.

39:38.473 --> 39:40.440
Eric, how could you?

39:40.475 --> 39:41.742
I did it because I knew.

39:41.776 --> 39:43.343
You and me, working together--

39:43.378 --> 39:45.011
we could have made
a real difference.

39:45.046 --> 39:47.147
You understand
how to make sacrifices

39:47.181 --> 39:48.615
for the greater good.

39:48.649 --> 39:51.618
And I figured that once you were
done grieving, that...

39:51.652 --> 39:52.953
Don't you love me?

39:52.987 --> 39:55.055
AUBREY:
Doesn't matter now.

39:55.089 --> 39:56.990
(handcuffs clicking)
You are under arrest

39:57.024 --> 39:58.959
for the murder of
a United States senator.

39:58.993 --> 40:00.427
BOOTH: Let's go.
Lynette...

40:08.403 --> 40:10.437
♪

40:20.715 --> 40:23.717
So she's officially not
taking the senator's seat?

40:23.751 --> 40:26.420
The governor withdrew his offer,
which is understandable.

40:26.454 --> 40:29.156
The whole thing's been a huge
P.R. scandal for the party.

40:29.190 --> 40:30.657
JESSICA: Do they know
who they're going to appoint?

40:30.691 --> 40:31.825
Nope.

40:31.859 --> 40:34.561
And to tell you the truth,
I don't think it really matters.

40:34.595 --> 40:35.896
As far as I can tell,

40:35.930 --> 40:38.965
one politician is
just as bad the next.

40:39.000 --> 40:40.667
You don't believe that.

40:41.636 --> 40:43.670
Well, don't you?

40:43.704 --> 40:46.039
No.

40:46.073 --> 40:48.775
'Cause for every
slime bag out there,

40:48.810 --> 40:50.377
there's also somebody like you.

40:50.411 --> 40:52.813
And as long as there's
yous around, then I know

40:52.847 --> 40:55.282
that there's somebody who is
looking out for this country.

40:55.316 --> 40:56.716
And me.

40:56.751 --> 40:59.920
Except when I'm holding
your past against you.

40:59.954 --> 41:03.223
Yeah. No one's perfect.

41:03.257 --> 41:06.092
Especially not the guy
who is forcing me to eat pigeon.

41:06.127 --> 41:08.128
Come on.
I'm doing you a favor.

41:08.162 --> 41:10.664
I'm trying to teach you
about the finer things in life.

41:10.698 --> 41:12.132
Ah, yes,
the finer things.

41:12.166 --> 41:14.100
Do you know the hours
I have to work

41:14.135 --> 41:16.036
so that I can eat something
better than roadkill?

41:16.070 --> 41:18.071
Look, just trust me on this one.

41:18.105 --> 41:19.105
If I vomit...

41:19.140 --> 41:21.174
You're not gonna vomit.

41:21.209 --> 41:23.810
Well, you seem very certain of yourself.
I am.

41:23.845 --> 41:27.080
I'm also pretty certain
about you.

41:35.857 --> 41:37.224
Keep your eyes closed.

41:37.258 --> 41:38.725
Ow.
Don't run into the wall, Booth.

41:38.759 --> 41:40.660
I'm not running, you're steering me.
No, I'm not...

41:40.695 --> 41:41.962
I can't see.
You can't...

41:41.996 --> 41:43.230
Where's the bed?
You're too strong to steer.

41:43.264 --> 41:44.464
Okay. Now, uh... no!

41:44.499 --> 41:45.899
(laughs): Don't.
It's right here.

41:45.933 --> 41:47.200
Okay.
Ow.

41:47.235 --> 41:48.969
You just stepped on my boot.
You can open.

41:49.003 --> 41:51.037
Oh, wow. Wow!

41:51.072 --> 41:52.405
What's this?

41:52.440 --> 41:54.374
It is quite clearly
a television.

41:54.408 --> 41:55.942
I know that.
But you know what?

41:55.977 --> 41:57.477
But you said no.
This has got to be

41:57.512 --> 41:59.012
at least 50 inches.
Fifty-six.

41:59.046 --> 42:01.248
I was told
the ideal size for a television

42:01.282 --> 42:04.217
was half the distance
from the viewing area.

42:04.252 --> 42:05.986
This is great! I... Thank you
so much for buying this.

42:06.020 --> 42:07.287
I didn't buy it. We're leasing.

42:07.321 --> 42:09.289
Huh?
Think of this as an experiment.

42:09.323 --> 42:12.192
If our intimacy level falls
below a certain threshold,

42:12.226 --> 42:14.261
then the TV
gets returned.

42:14.295 --> 42:15.829
What's the threshold?

42:15.863 --> 42:17.330
A number of my choosing.

42:17.365 --> 42:19.733
But I'm sure you can
rise to the challenge.

42:19.767 --> 42:20.734
Really?

42:20.768 --> 42:23.169
Rising...

42:23.204 --> 42:25.405
But not tonight,
'cause I want to watch the news.

42:25.439 --> 42:27.674
Hey, what do you mean?
Wait, what news?

42:27.708 --> 42:29.843
I'm being interviewed for
my participation in the case.

42:29.877 --> 42:32.212
Also, there's a documentary
I've been meaning to watch.

42:32.246 --> 42:34.781
Have you seen James Cagney's
White Heat?

42:34.815 --> 42:37.250
(imitates Cagney): "Look at me, Ma!
Top of the world!"

42:37.285 --> 42:38.852
My Bogart was
much better than that.

42:38.886 --> 42:40.453
Are you kidding me?

42:40.488 --> 42:42.422
Your Bogart sounded like <i>Zoolander.</i>
<i>No. Booth...</i>

42:42.456 --> 42:43.990
Give me that.
I don't watch...

42:44.025 --> 42:44.897
I don't watch
science fiction.

42:44.898 --> 42:45.627
All right!

42:45.651 --> 42:47.784
We'll get the game on!
No, not the game.

42:48.062 --> 42:50.063
The Flyers! Put it on!
They play tonight!

42:50.097 --> 42:52.299
(chatter continues)
