WEBVTT

00:00.023 --> 00:01.819
What did Private Clutterbuck tell you?

00:01.858 --> 00:04.952
That you'd served together
in the same unit in Kenya

00:04.994 --> 00:09.761
and one by one, members of your old unit
were being killed by a Mau Mau.

00:10.967 --> 00:15.165
- There are two ways of approaching this.
- Your way or my way.

00:15.204 --> 00:17.263
The adult way or the child's way.

00:17.307 --> 00:19.468
Tomorrow, for sure.

00:19.509 --> 00:22.876
That Mau Mau will strike tonight.
Tomorrow night at the latest.

00:23.913 --> 00:26.507
- Magnum!
- Don't you ever knock?

02:43.052 --> 02:47.216
- 'Allo, ducks!
- Good Lord!

02:47.256 --> 02:52.353
Where'd you learn your trade, girl,
watching old Ronald Colman movies?

02:52.395 --> 02:55.922
Sorry, it usually works on men your age.

02:57.333 --> 02:59.995
Especially when there's a full moon.

06:02.118 --> 06:04.678
"So we'll go no more a-roving.

06:04.720 --> 06:06.779
"So late into the night.

06:06.822 --> 06:09.086
"Though the heart be still as loving.

06:09.125 --> 06:11.855
"And the moon be still as bright.

06:11.894 --> 06:14.419
"For the sword outwears its sheath."

06:14.463 --> 06:16.988
"And the soul wears out the beasts."

06:17.033 --> 06:19.331
"And the heart must pause to breathe."

06:19.368 --> 06:21.666
"And love itself have rest."

06:33.115 --> 06:36.846
"And though the night was made for loving."

06:36.886 --> 06:39.218
"And the day returns too soon."

06:40.089 --> 06:42.887
"Yet we'll go no more a-roving."

06:42.925 --> 06:45.917
"By the light of the moon."

06:53.903 --> 06:55.734
If you ladies will excuse me,

06:55.771 --> 07:00.606
I'll ask our accompanist to play something
more appropriate to Lord Byron.

07:04.680 --> 07:10.448
Jonathan! I thought your reading was
breathtaking, simply breathtaking.

07:10.486 --> 07:12.579
I'm glad it was good. Thank you.

07:12.621 --> 07:17.081
It wasn't just good. It was splendid.

07:17.126 --> 07:19.526
We must discuss Elizabeth's poetry.

07:19.562 --> 07:23.259
- Elizabeth's?
- Barrett Browning!

07:23.299 --> 07:26.132
- Oh, of course.
- Splendid.

07:26.168 --> 07:29.569
Then I'll return this e'en. Say, around seven?

07:29.605 --> 07:32.472
Tonight? Perhaps tomorrow.

07:32.508 --> 07:37.343
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I must put a stop to that infernal chanting.

07:37.380 --> 07:39.245
On the morrow!

07:43.853 --> 07:46.788
<i>Living alone has terrific advantages</i>.

07:46.822 --> 07:50.815
<i>You can eat, sleep, go in and out
and burp whenever you want.</i>

07:50.860 --> 07:53.488
<i>It also has one terrific disadvantage</i> -

07:53.529 --> 07:57.329
<i>when you lose something,
there's no one to blame but yourself.</i>

07:57.366 --> 07:59.766
Magnum!

08:04.206 --> 08:06.766
Magnum!

08:08.177 --> 08:09.735
Higgins!

08:09.779 --> 08:11.610
Don't come in!

08:12.615 --> 08:16.642
- You came in!
- What in God's name are you doing?

08:16.685 --> 08:20.781
I told you not to come in.
Remember that. I tried to stop you.

08:20.823 --> 08:23.018
Stop me? Stop me?

08:23.058 --> 08:28.928
As caretaker of Robin Masters' estate,
I have a perfect right to enter day or night!

08:28.964 --> 08:30.397
You'll wish you didn't.

08:30.433 --> 08:35.530
I also have a right to demand that
you stop blasting Masai fertility chants...

08:35.571 --> 08:38.039
Is that what they are?

08:38.073 --> 08:40.701
While I am reciting...

08:40.743 --> 08:44.076
We'll Go No More A-Roving.

08:45.848 --> 08:47.475
We'll Go No More A-Roving?

08:47.516 --> 08:51.953
A lesser known poem of Lord Byron's.
I was holding a recitation

08:51.987 --> 08:56.686
for the Honolulu Society
For The Preservation Of English Poetry.

08:56.725 --> 08:58.556
Oh, my God!

08:59.428 --> 09:02.989
- What's wrong?
- London blitzed didn't look this bad.

09:05.734 --> 09:09.295
- How can you live in such filth?
- It's not filthy.

09:10.773 --> 09:12.570
It's just a little messy.

09:13.142 --> 09:16.009
As Robin Masters... What's that?

09:16.045 --> 09:19.105
- Doc Ibold.
- Dr. Ibold? What's he doing here?

09:19.148 --> 09:21.844
Probably nailing up the quarantine sign.

09:25.221 --> 09:26.813
That ought to do it.

09:28.257 --> 09:30.851
- Oh, no!
- It's not my fault.

09:30.893 --> 09:34.727
I told him to stay out
but he wouldn't listen, he used his key.

09:34.763 --> 09:39.166
- Quarantine?
- Damn it! I was afraid this would happen.

09:39.201 --> 09:41.931
You've never had
African Hemorrhagic Fever?

09:41.971 --> 09:45.839
- Of course not!
- It happens to the best of families. Right?

09:45.875 --> 09:50.778
Right. I caught it in '63 in Nigeria.
During my stint in the Peace Corps.

09:50.813 --> 09:53.680
And you caught it?
Magnum, how could you?

09:54.550 --> 09:58.611
- Gee, I guess I wanted to get sick.
- You don't look sick.

09:58.654 --> 10:01.384
- I don't feel sick.
- He may not be sick.

10:01.423 --> 10:04.392
We'll know
when the incubation period is over.

10:04.426 --> 10:06.621
How did you manage to expose yourself

10:06.662 --> 10:10.564
to something as obscure
as African Hemorrhagic Fever?

10:10.599 --> 10:14.695
I followed Mrs. Davis aboard the Katanga
during my investigation.

10:14.737 --> 10:19.299
That sordid divorce case!
I knew something like this would happen.

10:19.341 --> 10:23.869
One of the sailors got it yesterday.
The entire ship's been quarantined.

10:23.913 --> 10:27.815
And everyone who was in contact with him,
including Thomas.

10:27.850 --> 10:30.444
And now, I'm afraid, you too.

10:32.621 --> 10:36.079
- How long?
- Seven days.

10:37.860 --> 10:42.854
You mean for the next week
I'm going to have to live in this...

10:42.898 --> 10:46.925
- squalor with...
- I found it!

10:48.404 --> 10:50.429
Him.

11:18.901 --> 11:21.836
Island Hoppers,
your magic carpet in paradise.

11:21.870 --> 11:24.134
<i>Hi, T.C. It's T.M</i>.

11:27.543 --> 11:29.408
<i>Are you there, T.C.?</i>

11:40.990 --> 11:43.288
Your phone is ringing.

11:43.325 --> 11:47.819
It's just Thomas asking me to fly him
somewhere for gas money.

12:01.844 --> 12:06.975
Island Hoppers. Leave a message
at the beep and we'll get back to you. Beep.

12:10.085 --> 12:14.181
What if that were someone wanting
to hire your magic carpet?

12:15.124 --> 12:19.117
- Uh... isn't that why you're here?
- Yes.

12:19.695 --> 12:21.492
Well...

12:21.530 --> 12:23.896
I've only got one magic carpet.

12:24.900 --> 12:26.060
Er, Miss...?

12:28.203 --> 12:31.366
Kiamani. Bibi Kiamani.

12:39.522 --> 12:44.648
Now, then. The first order of business
is to clean up this... this...

12:44.684 --> 12:46.015
pigsty.

12:46.052 --> 12:50.079
Then I'll assign sleeping quarters,
work up a fitness program

12:50.122 --> 12:52.590
and determine kitchen duties.

12:52.625 --> 12:54.991
I hope your larder is amply stocked.

12:58.364 --> 13:01.299
While you're in there
would you get me a beer?

13:02.868 --> 13:05.200
Fortunately, it's the start of the month

13:05.237 --> 13:08.502
and the main house has food
more suitable to my palate.

13:08.541 --> 13:10.771
I'll ask Dr. Ibold to transfer...

13:11.844 --> 13:13.539
Magnum.

13:13.579 --> 13:17.106
- Sorry, want a bite?
- No, I don't want a bite.

13:37.069 --> 13:39.196
It won't work, you know.

13:39.238 --> 13:41.604
- What won't?
- I won't let you get to me.

13:41.640 --> 13:44.939
Oh. I'm not trying to get to you.

13:44.977 --> 13:48.777
I'm stuck with you
because you barged in here!

13:48.814 --> 13:53.046
- I explained all that.
- Which in my book makes you the guest.

13:53.085 --> 13:55.553
The unwanted guest.

13:55.588 --> 14:00.218
So, if there are any rules to be made,
I will make them.

14:00.259 --> 14:03.387
And the first one is live and let live.

14:11.270 --> 14:12.999
Magnum.

14:13.038 --> 14:16.838
- Live and let live can only lead to anarchy.
- So be it!

14:18.277 --> 14:21.713
We have to find a more sensible way
of surviving this.

14:21.747 --> 14:23.874
No, we don't!

14:25.050 --> 14:28.645
Yes, we do.
I see two ways of approaching this.

14:29.321 --> 14:31.721
Your way or my way.

14:31.757 --> 14:34.453
The adult way or the child's way.

14:34.493 --> 14:37.826
And I suppose I'm the child?

14:43.335 --> 14:45.496
- Who's ahead?
- He is.

14:45.538 --> 14:47.472
No, I meant the ballgame.

14:47.506 --> 14:49.599
Hi, Thomas. How's it going?

14:49.642 --> 14:51.109
That's far enough.

14:51.143 --> 14:53.805
He's not going to be in quarantine with us?

14:53.846 --> 14:56.041
- Not if I can help it.
- Thank God.

14:56.081 --> 14:59.175
- Hey, did you get it?
- Yeah, catch.

14:59.218 --> 15:01.948
Where's the...

15:01.987 --> 15:03.887
batteries?

15:04.957 --> 15:07.016
Hey, thanks, Rick.

15:08.961 --> 15:10.394
This is great!

15:10.429 --> 15:14.263
You're welcome.
If you need me I'll be in the main house.

15:14.300 --> 15:17.326
- What?
- Someone has to take care of the dogs.

15:17.369 --> 15:20.566
- The lads will stay here with me.
- No, they won't!

15:20.606 --> 15:21.903
Yes, they will!

15:21.941 --> 15:24.535
You don't want to expose them to the fever?

15:24.577 --> 15:28.673
Canines are not susceptible
to African Hemorrhagic Fever!

15:28.714 --> 15:30.909
- Are they?
- Yes, they are.

15:30.950 --> 15:35.546
Well, now that that's settled,
I'll talk to you guys later.

15:35.588 --> 15:37.954
Thanks, Rick, Doc.

15:43.162 --> 15:48.122
<i>A touchdown for the Raiders
with a 93-yard fumble recoveryl.</i>

15:52.037 --> 15:55.268
- No lads for a week.
- Cheer up, Higgins.

15:55.307 --> 15:57.605
We all have our little crosses to bear.

15:57.643 --> 16:02.103
<i>Shabby quality demonstration
that has taken place today on this gridiron.</i>

16:02.147 --> 16:06.174
<i>This is an embarrassment
to the entire league.</i>

16:08.988 --> 16:11.889
You know what I like about you?
What?

16:11.924 --> 16:16.918
You got class.
You haven't said one word about my...

16:16.962 --> 16:18.827
attire.

16:18.864 --> 16:23.028
But why should I?
I assume that you dined out last night.

16:23.068 --> 16:25.798
- In a tux?
- Well, it was Saturday night.

16:29.041 --> 16:31.771
What's that London magazine you work for?

16:31.810 --> 16:34.574
- Lords And Ladies.
- Never heard of it.

16:34.613 --> 16:39.312
You can only subscribe to Lords And Ladies
if you're in the registry.

16:39.351 --> 16:42.320
- Registry?
- Burke's Peerage.

16:42.354 --> 16:45.790
You know, lords and ladies.
Dukes and duchesses.

16:45.824 --> 16:48.452
Oh, that registry.

16:50.696 --> 16:53.358
- Where are you from?
- Kenya.

16:53.399 --> 16:55.333
That's where I was born.

16:55.367 --> 16:59.633
My parents immigrated to England
when I was three months old.

17:00.639 --> 17:03.938
Wasn't the African emigration from Kenya

17:03.976 --> 17:06.672
frozen in the mid-'50s after the uprising?

17:08.113 --> 17:13.016
Yes, that's true.
But I'm a bit older than that, thank you.

17:13.051 --> 17:14.848
I was born in '48.

17:14.887 --> 17:19.550
- '48, '58, '68...
- How long to Robin Masters' estate?

17:19.590 --> 17:22.059
We've been flying over it for ten minutes.

17:22.094 --> 17:26.690
That's the main complex up ahead.
How close can we get?

17:26.732 --> 17:29.565
Er... as close as you'd like.

17:29.601 --> 17:34.800
I'm sort of a close personal friend
of Robin Masters, you know.

17:39.211 --> 17:42.009
This is intolerable!

17:42.047 --> 17:46.381
I'm going to insist the FAA send a man out
to ground him the moment he lands.

17:46.418 --> 17:48.443
Tell them to have T.C. call me.

17:48.487 --> 17:52.116
He always hangs up.
Must be something wrong with his phone.

17:52.157 --> 17:55.615
<i>Higgins.
I found the package marked "lads".</i>

17:55.661 --> 17:58.459
<i>There must be a mistake</i> -
<i>this is top sirloin</i>.

17:58.497 --> 18:00.260
- It's no mistake.
- Rick!

18:00.299 --> 18:03.860
Char it on the outside
and send it down with a bottle of red.

18:03.902 --> 18:06.700
Are you kidding?
I'm gonna eat it myself.

18:06.739 --> 18:08.832
Only kidding, guys.

18:08.874 --> 18:11.069
- Don't you dare.
- <i>OK, OK</i>.

18:11.110 --> 18:15.945
Chop the steak into two-inch cubes
and sprinkle on parsley and garlic.

18:15.981 --> 18:17.676
<i>The lads prefer it that way</i>.

18:17.716 --> 18:19.411
- Tough.
- <i>What?</i>

18:19.451 --> 18:21.851
Erm, that was Zeus, he said, "Ruff."

18:23.889 --> 18:25.857
It didn't sound like Zeus.

18:25.891 --> 18:27.722
More like Apollo.

18:27.760 --> 18:30.627
Oh, my God!

18:33.365 --> 18:35.299
Forget it, Higgins.

18:35.334 --> 18:37.199
He's heading for the hangar.

18:38.237 --> 18:41.365
So am I. Good night.

18:42.408 --> 18:44.535
It's not even seven yet.

18:46.378 --> 18:47.811
I don't feel so good.

18:47.846 --> 18:51.976
Small wonder. You've had two hot dogs,
three beers, a bag of pretzels,

18:52.017 --> 18:54.952
Lord knows how many Fig Newtons
and a couple...

18:54.987 --> 18:57.785
Magnum. You don't suppose it's the fever?

19:04.229 --> 19:08.427
No. Like you said,
all that food and no exercise.

19:08.467 --> 19:12.699
- Perhaps I should call Dr. Ibold?
- Don't bother, he'll be by tomorrow.

19:12.738 --> 19:14.899
Couple of Seltzers, I'll be fine.

19:19.611 --> 19:21.169
Night, Higgins.

19:21.213 --> 19:23.113
Good night, Magnum.

19:36.562 --> 19:38.723
At last.

19:38.764 --> 19:40.425
Silence.

20:12.798 --> 20:14.789
Thomas.

20:15.400 --> 20:17.766
Psst! Thomas.

20:20.606 --> 20:22.597
- Thomas.
- Shh!

20:22.641 --> 20:24.632
Just a second.

20:46.365 --> 20:49.857
- Aren't you afraid of catching the fever?
- I'm just terrified.

20:49.902 --> 20:52.928
- Where's Edwin?
- Right here, old chap.

21:02.628 --> 21:04.823
Any sign of him?
No.

21:04.864 --> 21:08.800
- But that bloody wog's on the island.
- Shh!

21:08.835 --> 21:13.636
Mr. Clutterbuck, I don't know
what actually happened in Kenya in '53...

21:13.673 --> 21:17.507
I've told you. If you don't believe me,
ask the sergeant major.

21:17.543 --> 21:22.674
I can't. Higgins might get suspicious
and realize this quarantine thing's a ruse.

21:22.715 --> 21:25.445
- If there is a Mau Mau out there...
- There is.

21:25.485 --> 21:26.975
He'd be an easy target.

21:27.019 --> 21:32.150
Instead of watching that concert on TV,
he'd be attending it, regardless of the risk.

21:33.192 --> 21:37.185
The old sergeant major. Always was
as stubborn as a Welsh donkey.

21:37.230 --> 21:40.028
We can't keep Higgins quarantined forever.

21:40.066 --> 21:41.966
We don't have to.

21:43.035 --> 21:46.630
That Mau Mau will strike tonight,
tomorrow night at the latest.

21:46.672 --> 21:48.367
How can you be sure?

21:48.407 --> 21:52.605
Buckminster, Taylor, Crawford

21:52.645 --> 21:54.772
were all murdered a month apart...

21:56.282 --> 21:58.079
on a full moon.

21:58.117 --> 22:01.416
Tried to get me last month, on a full moon.

22:01.454 --> 22:04.218
What does a full moon
have to do with it?

22:04.257 --> 22:06.350
Who can figure a bloody wog?

22:09.462 --> 22:12.556
- Dogs locked up?
- In the wine cellar.

22:12.598 --> 22:14.623
Those Dobermans.

22:15.868 --> 22:17.529
They could give us a warning.

22:17.570 --> 22:20.004
The Mau Mau would torture
a man's animals,

22:20.039 --> 22:22.735
behead them, as a sign, isn't that right?

22:22.775 --> 22:24.538
Not just animals.

22:27.713 --> 22:29.738
The dogs stay in the wine cellar.

22:30.683 --> 22:32.674
Oh. Très gallant.

22:32.718 --> 22:37.678
Look, I haven't liked you since I found you
at the front gate looking for Higgins.

22:37.723 --> 22:40.715
Your story smells like low tide at the docks.

22:40.760 --> 22:43.729
I'm going along with you cos I got no choice.

22:43.763 --> 22:48.996
I just stopped in Hawaii to warn a chum,
that's all. I could have kept on running.

22:49.035 --> 22:52.994
Everybody's gotta stop running
sometime, don't they?

22:55.875 --> 22:57.365
You're quite right.

22:59.879 --> 23:01.540
Quite right.

23:02.849 --> 23:04.646
A man...

23:05.618 --> 23:08.985
can't run from his past forever.

23:09.021 --> 23:10.454
Hm?

23:27.139 --> 23:30.199
- What do you make of that?
- I don't know.

23:30.243 --> 23:32.609
He's not as easily pegged as I thought.

23:32.645 --> 23:35.614
- What now?
- We stick to our plan.

23:35.648 --> 23:38.674
I'll join you as soon as Higgins is asleep.

23:39.719 --> 23:43.155
- You try that stuff on?
- Yeah.

23:43.189 --> 23:46.420
- You'll be all right.
- Mm-hm.

23:48.261 --> 23:51.992
- Did you hear from T.C.?
- No. I can't figure it out.

23:52.031 --> 23:54.761
- He flew over this afternoon.
- I saw him.

23:54.800 --> 23:58.566
So I know he's on the island.
He hung up on me twice this morning.

23:58.604 --> 24:01.903
Didn't answer any of my messages.
Doesn't make sense.

24:01.941 --> 24:03.738
Yes, it does.

24:03.776 --> 24:06.973
- How much do you owe him?
- It's not that.

24:08.180 --> 24:12.173
<i>Something's gotta be distracting him,
that's all.</i>

24:12.218 --> 24:15.187
There. Here we are.

24:16.222 --> 24:20.852
Say, have you had anything to eat?
Like, maybe dinner?

24:22.128 --> 24:26.792
Well, I am tempted
but I'm working on a 16-hour jet lag.

24:26.832 --> 24:31.565
Oh. Dinner time in the islands
means it must be tea time in London.

24:31.604 --> 24:33.697
How about tea and crumpets?

24:35.141 --> 24:40.306
- Where will you find crumpets in Honolulu?
- You leave that to me. I'll find them.

24:41.347 --> 24:46.444
T.C., you are funny. Perhaps tomorrow.

24:47.887 --> 24:50.515
Oh, yeah, sure. Tomorrow.

25:06.605 --> 25:08.630
Tomorrow, for sure.

25:40.473 --> 25:42.168
My car, please.

26:35.261 --> 26:37.195
No!

27:52.338 --> 27:56.707
<i>Ever notice when you want someone to do
what they usually do, they don't?</i>

27:58.477 --> 28:01.139
<i>Any other night,
Higgins would be in bed by now</i>

28:01.180 --> 28:03.910
<i>but tonight,
when I needed him sound asleep,</i>

28:03.949 --> 28:07.715
<i>he was wide awake
listening to African music.</i>

28:07.753 --> 28:10.779
<i>At least that part of my plan was working</i>.

28:20.599 --> 28:25.059
- Magnum, I hope I didn't wake you?
- No.

28:25.104 --> 28:28.164
I couldn't sleep.

28:29.675 --> 28:31.734
You like that stuff?

28:31.777 --> 28:33.972
It's not stuff.

28:34.013 --> 28:38.074
- Where did you get this tape, anyway?
- Dr. Ibold.

28:38.117 --> 28:40.312
He said as long as I caught the fever,

28:40.352 --> 28:43.344
I might as well have the music
to go along with it.

28:43.389 --> 28:48.258
- Doctors have a peculiar sense of humor.
- Doctors and undertakers.

28:48.294 --> 28:52.355
Yes, I didn't want to mention that,
given your potential condition.

28:52.398 --> 28:54.832
Our potential condition.

28:55.868 --> 28:58.769
- Feeling better?
- A little.

28:58.804 --> 29:00.567
I guess I ate too much.

29:04.877 --> 29:08.369
What did you say this was?
Masai fertility dance?

29:09.215 --> 29:13.413
This particular section
is part of their rites of passage.

29:13.452 --> 29:15.511
A puberty ceremony, so to speak.

29:16.555 --> 29:18.955
It's not very pleasant to watch.

29:18.991 --> 29:23.018
I suppose it's no more primitive
than our prep-school hazing.

29:23.062 --> 29:25.394
When were you in Africa?

29:26.599 --> 29:30.626
I was in North Africa during the war,
attached to Alexander's command.

29:30.669 --> 29:35.163
Fought against Rommel.
I remember once, outside El Alamein...

29:36.609 --> 29:40.010
I meant when did you see the Masai rites?

29:41.947 --> 29:44.780
When I was stationed in Kenya in '53.

29:44.817 --> 29:49.777
1953? That was about the time
of the Mau Mau uprising, wasn't it?

29:51.790 --> 29:53.018
Yes.

29:55.928 --> 29:58.897
- Scotch?
- No, this is fine.

30:04.069 --> 30:05.764
What was it like?

30:07.273 --> 30:08.604
It was bloody.

30:16.215 --> 30:18.945
The Mau Mau came from the Kikuyu tribe.

30:20.719 --> 30:23.552
And the Kikuyu could be a savage people.

30:26.892 --> 30:29.827
But then, so could we.

30:32.598 --> 30:35.533
Take away our bowlers and school ties,

30:35.567 --> 30:39.503
remove us from our cities
where others kill our meat,

30:39.538 --> 30:44.168
from our books and films, where we
vicariously live out our baser emotions,

30:45.144 --> 30:51.049
set us down in the African bush where
every living thing is killing or being killed,

30:52.084 --> 30:55.884
and we can be as savage
as any tribe on the face of the earth.

30:58.824 --> 31:00.917
You know what I mean?

31:00.959 --> 31:02.654
Yes, I've been there.

31:04.063 --> 31:05.724
Africa?

31:05.764 --> 31:07.561
Vietnam.

31:38.630 --> 31:40.495
<i>Thomas, do you read me?</i>

31:43.335 --> 31:46.600
Five by five. Higgins is still awake.

31:48.107 --> 31:50.337
Tough. I need you up here now.

31:50.376 --> 31:54.005
We got a visitor - the south beach
and he's heading this way.

31:54.046 --> 31:58.540
- Is Clutterbuck in position?
- <i>Yes, he's upstairs on the balcony</i>.

31:59.551 --> 32:02.384
- Thomas, I don't like this.
- I'm on my way, Rick.

32:08.327 --> 32:10.022
Rick.

32:10.062 --> 32:13.429
- He's coming towards the guest house.
- <i>Are you sure?</i>

32:13.465 --> 32:14.796
Magnum?

32:14.833 --> 32:16.960
What the bloody hell is going on?

32:17.002 --> 32:19.664
Don't you ever knock?

32:19.705 --> 32:23.664
Come back here!
You'll contaminate the estate!

32:46.165 --> 32:48.497
Rick. Rick!

33:19.428 --> 33:23.159
Of all the imbecilic ideas -
African Hemorrhagic Fever!

33:23.198 --> 33:26.099
- I don't know, it fooled you.
- Fooled me!

33:26.135 --> 33:28.330
- Ow! Watch it!
- I'm sorry, Rick.

33:28.370 --> 33:32.898
- You can blame that on Magnum.
- He was only trying to protect you.

33:32.942 --> 33:36.241
- Protect me?
- That's it! I'll fix my own busted head.

33:36.278 --> 33:38.439
See what your interfering can do?

33:38.480 --> 33:43.782
Did it ever occur to you that three wars
and 37 years in Her Majesty's Service

33:43.819 --> 33:46.083
might instruct me to protect myself?

33:46.121 --> 33:50.524
If you'd known a Mau Mau was hunting you,
would you have battened yourself in

33:50.559 --> 33:54.290
- or gone to the concert?
- Gone to the concert. That's not the point.

33:54.330 --> 33:56.298
That is precisely the point.

33:56.332 --> 34:00.428
You may be a tough old Brit
but when it comes to protecting yourself,

34:00.469 --> 34:04.667
- you're as stubborn as... an Irish mule.
- He means a Welsh donkey.

34:04.707 --> 34:07.938
Whatever! If I hadn't gotten Doc
to quarantine you,

34:07.977 --> 34:11.378
that Mau Mau would've had you
hanging from a tree by now.

34:11.413 --> 34:13.210
I am not a Mau Mau.

34:15.083 --> 34:17.746
Oh. She speaks.

34:17.786 --> 34:21.654
I suppose you didn't clip Rick with...
whatever the hell this is.

34:21.690 --> 34:24.681
It's a rungu.
I haven't seen one in 30 years.

34:24.726 --> 34:27.286
The Kikuyu make them
from the baobab tree.

34:27.329 --> 34:30.492
Fired and polished they're as hard as steel...

34:30.532 --> 34:31.862
and just as deadly.

34:31.900 --> 34:37.235
- Yeah, tell me about it.
- I didn't hit you with the rung...

34:37.272 --> 34:41.299
- The Mau Mau did.
- Then why were you carrying these?

34:41.342 --> 34:44.369
One. I was only carrying one.

34:44.413 --> 34:47.280
We know what you did with the other one.

34:47.315 --> 34:50.842
- May I explain?
- This ought to be bloody good.

34:54.623 --> 34:59.583
My name is Bibi Kiamani
and I am a member of the Kenyan CID.

35:00.462 --> 35:02.430
Never heard of it.

35:02.464 --> 35:07.800
It's the Criminal Investigation Department.
It exists.

35:07.836 --> 35:11.499
- That part of what she's saying is true.
- Thank you.

35:12.608 --> 35:18.342
After three ex-British soldiers
who served in the same regiment in Kenya

35:18.380 --> 35:22.043
were murdered recently
by methods reminiscent of the Mau Mau,

35:22.084 --> 35:24.552
Scotland Yard informed our government

35:24.586 --> 35:29.023
and I was sent to London
to assist in the investigation.

35:29.058 --> 35:32.516
You are that damned tart
that tried to pick me up

35:32.561 --> 35:35.428
the same night
that Mau Mau came after me!

35:35.464 --> 35:39.423
Well, which is it, Miss Kiamani, CID or tart?

35:42.438 --> 35:47.569
Mr. Clutterbuck and your friend here
obviously share one quality -

35:47.609 --> 35:50.077
they are both stubborn.

35:50.112 --> 35:54.879
He refused Scotland Yard's protection.
No bodyguard, no protective custody...

35:54.917 --> 35:58.080
So they sent a bloody wog
to spend the night with me.

35:58.120 --> 36:00.418
They did not send me.

36:01.490 --> 36:05.950
Your penchant for African women
is well-documented.

36:14.036 --> 36:20.464
So I decided, on my own,
that it was the best way to stay close to you,

36:20.509 --> 36:22.943
to catch whoever was murdering the Brits.

36:22.978 --> 36:27.574
We have no desire to see
any reviving of the Mau Maus.

36:27.616 --> 36:33.452
They are of the past. And if the British
cannot stop him, then I must.

36:34.389 --> 36:39.349
You said the murder victims were all
ex-soldiers who had served in Kenya?

36:40.429 --> 36:45.196
- Yes.
- Privates Buckminster, Taylor,

36:47.269 --> 36:51.171
Lance Corporal Crawford, Sergeant Major.

37:00.783 --> 37:02.717
Biribi.

37:02.751 --> 37:04.685
What's Biribi, Higgins?

37:06.855 --> 37:11.053
A village in Kenya. At least it was.

37:11.093 --> 37:12.458
Higgins?

37:12.494 --> 37:16.954
- You're Sergeant Major Higgins.
- I suppose you didn't know that.

37:16.999 --> 37:19.126
No, I did not.

37:19.168 --> 37:24.003
I followed Clutterbuck here and assumed
he was a guest of Robin Masters.

37:24.039 --> 37:25.904
What happened at Biribi?

37:33.515 --> 37:37.542
Um... if you'll excuse me.

37:37.586 --> 37:39.986
- Hold on. Wait!
- I'm not feeling well.

37:40.022 --> 37:44.482
Let him go, Magnum. Let him go.

37:48.363 --> 37:50.331
What did Private Clutterbuck tell you?

37:50.365 --> 37:53.664
That you'd served together
in the same unit in Kenya

37:53.702 --> 37:57.763
and one by one, members of your old unit
were being killed by a Mau Mau.

37:57.806 --> 38:00.673
He showed us clippings
from the London Times.

38:00.709 --> 38:03.769
He told the truth, as far as he went.

38:04.980 --> 38:09.440
The ex-soldiers being killed
all took part in the Biribi massacre.

38:18.493 --> 38:20.484
Higgins?

38:24.199 --> 38:26.190
We had been in the bush a week

38:26.235 --> 38:30.968
when Privates Holmesby and O'Rourke
were ambushed whilst scouting a wadi.

38:32.140 --> 38:36.270
We found them at sunset, mutilated.

38:36.311 --> 38:41.613
But that word cannot possibly describe
what had been done to their bodies.

38:45.888 --> 38:48.049
There was a full moon

38:49.057 --> 38:52.549
so we were able to stay
on the Mau Mau's track.

38:57.766 --> 39:00.428
Around midnight we found them.

39:02.137 --> 39:06.301
There was a brief skirmish
and two of them were killed.

39:06.341 --> 39:10.141
But I was slashed by a panga
in the thigh and couldn't go on.

39:11.680 --> 39:14.979
I ordered the lads to press on.

39:17.352 --> 39:19.912
When I caught up with them
the next morning,

39:19.955 --> 39:23.118
they had tracked the Mau Mau to Biribi

39:24.159 --> 39:26.320
and leveled the village.

39:28.897 --> 39:31.957
A number of innocent Africans were killed,

39:32.000 --> 39:35.401
including some women and children.

39:37.806 --> 39:40.775
But it was my responsibility.

39:40.809 --> 39:44.370
I should never have allowed the lads
to go on without me.

39:52.621 --> 39:57.183
Sergeant Major Higgins reported
the massacre,

39:57.225 --> 39:59.693
assumed full responsibility

39:59.728 --> 40:04.495
and recommended a court-martial
for everyone involved, including himself.

40:07.869 --> 40:09.996
Naturally, he was absolved.

40:11.173 --> 40:16.668
Unfortunately, the others were simply
reprimanded and moved out of the country.

40:16.712 --> 40:20.113
The army did them no favor
by not court-martialing them.

40:25.821 --> 40:27.482
- Yes?
- <i>Jonathan?</i>

40:27.522 --> 40:30.582
Oh, I'm so relieved to hear your voice.

40:30.625 --> 40:33.423
Dr. Ibold said you'd call
and when you didn't

40:33.462 --> 40:37.660
I tried calling you up
but some strange man keeps answering.

40:37.699 --> 40:41.465
He said you were indisposed
and not to call back.

40:41.503 --> 40:45.200
Oh, Jonathan, I was so worried
I had to drive over.

40:45.240 --> 40:47.640
Agatha, calm down, I'm quite all right.

40:47.676 --> 40:51.703
<i>I won't believe it until I see
your shining face for myself.</i>

40:51.747 --> 40:54.079
Let her see your shining face.

40:54.116 --> 40:56.380
Yes, all right, but only for a moment.

40:56.418 --> 40:58.909
A moment 'tis enough.

40:59.755 --> 41:04.715
As Percy would say,
"Best and brightest come away."

41:04.760 --> 41:07.388
"Fairer far than this fair day."

41:07.429 --> 41:09.693
Yes, quite.

41:16.171 --> 41:18.662
Percy Bysshe Shelley.

41:20.409 --> 41:22.274
Of course.

41:28.550 --> 41:31.075
They were decent lads, you know.

41:31.119 --> 41:32.916
Young.

41:32.954 --> 41:36.685
Clutterbuck couldn't have been
more than 18.

41:36.725 --> 41:40.354
They were brutalized,
they'd seen their mates killed.

41:41.596 --> 41:44.258
It was just too bloody much for them.

41:46.334 --> 41:50.930
It would have been far better if they
had been court-martialed and punished.

41:50.972 --> 41:54.772
It would have given them a chance
to pay their debt.

41:54.810 --> 41:57.711
As it is...

41:57.746 --> 42:00.306
they just had to live with it.

43:50.725 --> 43:53.523
How'd you know Higgins
was in the guest house?

43:53.562 --> 43:56.793
I did not know Higgins even lived here.

43:56.831 --> 44:02.201
- I told you, I followed Clutterbuck.
- But I saw you yards from the guest house.

44:02.237 --> 44:05.866
- Higgins turned the light on and you ran.
- It wasn't me.

44:07.709 --> 44:10.143
Thomas...

44:10.178 --> 44:13.773
if she's telling the truth,
that Mau Mau is still here.

44:18.119 --> 44:21.088
Maybe he's always been here. Watch her.

44:26.494 --> 44:28.359
I don't understand, Jonathan.

44:28.396 --> 44:33.561
Dr. Ibold told me you'd taken a spill,
sprained your ankle.

44:33.602 --> 44:38.437
- That was Magnum's idea.
- That sordid man in the guest house?

44:38.473 --> 44:41.567
- The one who's always causing trouble?
- Yes.

44:50.552 --> 44:53.578
Edwin, don't. It's over.

45:23.184 --> 45:27.621
<i>The islands have a way of easing pain,
of helping one forget the past,</i>

45:27.656 --> 45:29.556
<i>which is probably why I'm here</i>.

45:29.591 --> 45:34.722
<i>But I had the feeling that no matter
how warm the sand or how blue the sky,</i>

45:34.763 --> 45:38.358
<i>part of me would never forget
Private Edwin Clutterbuck.</i>

45:38.400 --> 45:43.360
<i>I don't recall who said "war is hell"
but he was only half right.</i>

45:43.405 --> 45:48.001
<i>It isn't just war that's hell, it's living
with the memories of what you did in it.</i>

45:59.788 --> 46:02.518
I say, Magnum, this is most difficult.

46:05.360 --> 46:07.385
Not really, kid.

46:07.429 --> 46:10.330
It does take excellent peripheral vision,

46:10.365 --> 46:14.665
intense concentration
and quick reflexes to score really well.

46:14.703 --> 46:19.436
I'm sure I'll do better with a little practice.
So far I've only reached 24,000.

46:21.509 --> 46:24.603
How many points have you scored?

46:24.646 --> 46:27.046
Hey, Thomas!

46:27.082 --> 46:29.346
Thomas!

46:29.384 --> 46:32.512
- I need to talk to you.
- Have you seen this? Fascinating.

46:32.554 --> 46:35.114
I ain't got time for games.
I need your help.

46:35.156 --> 46:37.784
- Really? My help?
- Yeah.

46:37.826 --> 46:44.527
T.C., for two days I've left messages
at every haunt you're known to frequent.

46:44.566 --> 46:48.024
So don't tell me you didn't know
that I was looking for you.

46:49.070 --> 46:50.628
Hey, man...

46:50.672 --> 46:55.473
I'm sorry, but I got hung up with this lady.
You know - involved.

46:55.510 --> 46:58.138
- I can see that.
- So you'll help me, right?

46:58.179 --> 47:02.707
Her name is Bibi Kiamani.
She works for Lords And Ladies magazine.

47:02.751 --> 47:06.084
- Wait a minute. What's her name?
- Kiamani.

47:06.121 --> 47:09.818
- Bibi Kiamani. Ain't that pretty?
- It's beautiful.

47:09.858 --> 47:14.761
Oh. She wasn't at her hotel.
So you gotta help me find her.

47:15.397 --> 47:17.422
Gee, I don't know, T.C.

47:17.465 --> 47:22.061
I got a couple of heavy investigations,
which is why I was calling you.

47:22.103 --> 47:25.903
I'll do what I can but my money-paying
customers come first.

47:25.940 --> 47:30.400
Money-paying customers?!
All those IOUs you owe me?

47:30.445 --> 47:32.436
Er...

47:32.480 --> 47:35.813
Well, OK, you know. Hey, I'll rip 'em up.

47:35.850 --> 47:38.819
All $875.67 worth.

47:38.853 --> 47:41.651
You keep it exact to the penny?

47:41.689 --> 47:43.714
- It's a deal?
- Good morning!

47:45.627 --> 47:46.992
Wait.

47:47.028 --> 47:51.089
Hey, how can I not help a pal? It's a deal.

47:51.132 --> 47:53.259
T.C.!

47:53.301 --> 47:55.132
Is that you?
