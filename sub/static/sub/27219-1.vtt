00:26.927 --> 00:28.929
- Today is the
culmination of four years

00:28.929 --> 00:32.400
of 8 a.m. classes, 4
a.m. study sessions,

00:32.400 --> 00:35.035
boring teachers,
and 35 term papers,

00:35.035 --> 00:38.572
all written on a program
designed by a college dropout,

00:38.572 --> 00:42.076
typed on a computer created
by another college dropout,

00:42.076 --> 00:44.212
and all my posts and
tweets were on sites

00:44.212 --> 00:47.981
created by, you guessed
it, college dropouts.

00:47.981 --> 00:50.751
But somehow I'm supposed
to be more prepared

00:50.751 --> 00:54.222
for the real world than any of
the aforementioned dropouts.

00:54.222 --> 00:55.223
So they say.

00:56.657 --> 00:58.626
That's one of my
best friends, Emily.

00:58.626 --> 01:00.461
She loves the simple
things in life

01:00.461 --> 01:03.997
and has the biggest
heart of anyone I know.

01:05.833 --> 01:08.602
And she's getting married
to a great guy, Chris.

01:08.602 --> 01:10.471
They're one of those
couples that you just know

01:10.471 --> 01:12.806
are supposed to be together.

01:15.943 --> 01:18.045
Ashley is the
smartest one of us.

01:18.045 --> 01:21.949
4.0 GPA, class president,
crazy confident.

01:21.949 --> 01:23.451
She knows exactly what she wants

01:23.451 --> 01:25.586
and won't let anyone
stand in her way,

01:25.586 --> 01:27.588
especially college boys.

01:28.722 --> 01:31.825
I'm pretty sure she'll
be a CEO one day.

01:32.960 --> 01:34.928
And then there's me.

01:34.928 --> 01:36.230
How would I describe myself?

01:36.230 --> 01:38.399
Uh, I just wanna be happy.

01:39.767 --> 01:41.835
This is my Josh.

01:41.835 --> 01:44.405
He's 6 foot 2,
with big blue eyes,

01:44.405 --> 01:47.641
a beautiful smile,
and a bright future.

01:49.177 --> 01:50.944
These are my girls
and we're standing

01:50.944 --> 01:53.781
on the launchpad
of life together.

01:57.117 --> 01:57.985
Dad, what are you doing?

01:57.985 --> 01:58.819
- Oh hey!

01:58.819 --> 01:59.853
- I was looking for you.

01:59.853 --> 02:02.356
- Ah, I just don't like crowds.

02:03.257 --> 02:05.526
- Well look at you in your suit.

02:05.526 --> 02:07.695
All those moms were
totally checking you out.

02:07.695 --> 02:09.363
- Yeah, spiffy, huh?

02:10.398 --> 02:11.465
- I love you.

02:12.300 --> 02:14.368
- I love you, too.

02:14.368 --> 02:16.370
And I'm so proud of you.

02:17.371 --> 02:19.207
Your mom would be too.

02:20.708 --> 02:22.676
She'd be the one up there
screaming her head off

02:22.676 --> 02:23.944
when they called your name,

02:23.944 --> 02:27.080
blowing one of those
obnoxious air horns.

02:30.484 --> 02:31.885
- I miss her too.

02:33.687 --> 02:34.855
- [Friends] Jessica!

02:34.855 --> 02:36.257
Let's go!

02:36.257 --> 02:37.090
- Hey, go.

02:37.090 --> 02:38.025
Go be with your friends.

02:38.025 --> 02:38.826
- No, I'm staying here with you.

02:38.826 --> 02:40.628
- Go on, I'll be fine.

02:40.628 --> 02:41.529
- You sure?

02:43.231 --> 02:44.398
Alright.

02:44.398 --> 02:45.933
Well I'll see you
tomorrow at lunch, yeah?

02:45.933 --> 02:46.934
- You have a deal.

02:46.934 --> 02:47.768
I love you.

02:47.768 --> 02:49.603
- I love you too.

02:49.603 --> 02:50.438
Okay.

02:51.739 --> 02:54.308
(upbeat music)

02:55.743 --> 02:57.978
(laughing)

03:04.718 --> 03:06.420
- The best four
years of our lives,

03:06.420 --> 03:08.256
may there be many more!

03:08.256 --> 03:10.324
And to the best friends
anyone could ask for.

03:10.324 --> 03:11.158
I love you guys.

03:11.158 --> 03:12.593
- [Group] Cheers.

03:16.163 --> 03:18.266
- Incredible four years,
I'll never forget.

03:18.266 --> 03:19.800
- Me either.

03:19.800 --> 03:21.402
- Well that's because you
two are sentimental saps.

03:21.402 --> 03:23.304
- Well better a
sap than a cynic.

03:23.304 --> 03:26.307
- You are the one that wanted
me to sing the class song.

03:26.307 --> 03:27.775
- I can't wait to
get outta here.

03:27.775 --> 03:29.243
- Ashley, come on.

03:29.243 --> 03:31.579
Admit it, you're gonna miss
this just a little bit.

03:31.579 --> 03:32.846
- Not a bit.

03:32.846 --> 03:34.882
- I mean, all she ever
really did was study.

03:34.882 --> 03:37.084
- And intimate all the boys.

03:37.084 --> 03:39.653
- And my work here is done.

03:39.653 --> 03:41.422
- Hey Chris, let's
go get a drink.

03:41.422 --> 03:42.256
- What?

03:42.256 --> 03:43.824
- [Josh] Come on.

03:43.824 --> 03:44.658
- Okay.

03:47.728 --> 03:50.731
- Well we know
what that is about.

03:50.731 --> 03:53.200
- What is the word, ladies?

03:53.200 --> 03:54.968
A new chapter begins!

03:56.203 --> 03:57.738
Did you take that
job in Lexington?

03:57.738 --> 03:59.507
- Winestone Marketing.

03:59.507 --> 04:00.941
- Ooh, the big leagues.

04:00.941 --> 04:01.775
Are you excited?

04:01.775 --> 04:02.976
- Of course!

04:02.976 --> 04:05.245
It's the job of a lifetime.

04:06.780 --> 04:08.682
- Do you wanna dance?

04:08.682 --> 04:10.017
- I don't dance.

04:12.753 --> 04:14.021
- I'll be back.

04:19.427 --> 04:20.894
- What?

04:20.894 --> 04:21.928
- Ashley!

04:21.928 --> 04:22.830
- What is your deal?

04:22.830 --> 04:24.197
- Shut up!
- You like him.

04:24.197 --> 04:25.032
- Nuh-huh.

04:25.032 --> 04:25.966
- Yes.

04:25.966 --> 04:27.067
- I think he's kinda cute.

04:27.067 --> 04:28.702
- He's weird.

04:28.702 --> 04:30.103
- And you're not?

04:31.238 --> 04:34.708
- I didn't come to
college to find a guy.

04:34.708 --> 04:38.412
It's good for you
guys, just not for me.

04:38.412 --> 04:40.247
- What does that mean?

04:41.415 --> 04:43.784
- We all got what we
wanted out of college.

04:43.784 --> 04:48.288
I landed the perfect job,
you got the perfect fiance,

04:48.288 --> 04:50.223
and you got into the
perfect grad school.

04:50.223 --> 04:51.925
- And found a great guy.

04:51.925 --> 04:54.061
- Yeah, well, whatever.

04:54.061 --> 04:55.796
- Ashley, why
don't you like him?

04:55.796 --> 04:59.733
- I like him, I just
don't like him for you.

04:59.733 --> 05:00.534
- Okay.

05:00.534 --> 05:01.469
- What does that mean?

05:01.469 --> 05:02.970
- Let's not talk about that.

05:02.970 --> 05:05.606
- Well, we all know you're
getting a ring tonight.

05:05.606 --> 05:06.540
- We don't know that.

05:06.540 --> 05:08.609
- I am so excited for you.

05:09.510 --> 05:10.778
- Congrats, Jess.

05:10.778 --> 05:12.446
If you're happy, I'm happy.

05:12.446 --> 05:13.714
- Thank you.

05:13.714 --> 05:15.349
- Here he comes.

05:15.349 --> 05:19.953
So, after the female mates
with the male, she eats him.

05:22.490 --> 05:23.757
- Hey Jess, can we take a walk?

05:23.757 --> 05:24.592
- Sure.

05:27.561 --> 05:28.796
- Really?

05:28.796 --> 05:30.831
- Preying mantis.

05:30.831 --> 05:32.265
- Yeah, I got it.

05:43.677 --> 05:45.546
- You know how I feel about you.

05:45.546 --> 05:47.715
We've been together for--

05:47.715 --> 05:48.649
- Three years.

05:48.649 --> 05:49.950
- Yeah.

05:49.950 --> 05:52.285
You're such an awesome girl.

05:54.555 --> 05:58.492
There's, there's so
much that I wanna say,

05:58.492 --> 05:59.993
that I should say,

06:02.162 --> 06:06.634
but I've thought about
this for a long time.

06:06.634 --> 06:08.836
I think we should
take some time apart.

06:08.836 --> 06:09.670
- What?

06:11.271 --> 06:13.941
- [Josh] I just need
some time for me.

06:13.941 --> 06:15.676
- I don't understand.

06:15.676 --> 06:16.910
Did I do something wrong?

06:16.910 --> 06:19.547
- No, you didn't do anything.

06:19.547 --> 06:22.816
Look, Bo and Mark
and some other people

06:24.017 --> 06:26.587
are backpacking across
Europe this summer

06:26.587 --> 06:27.855
and they invited me to come.

06:27.855 --> 06:29.490
- But why didn't you
tell me about this?

06:29.490 --> 06:31.825
- I'm telling you now.

06:31.825 --> 06:33.326
- When are you coming back?

06:33.326 --> 06:35.295
- I don't know.

06:35.295 --> 06:36.296
At the end of summer.

06:36.296 --> 06:37.898
It depends.

06:37.898 --> 06:40.000
- Depends on what, Josh?

06:40.000 --> 06:43.036
- Depends on when we're ready.

06:43.036 --> 06:45.639
This is not about you, it's me.

06:47.975 --> 06:49.877
I can't breathe.

06:49.877 --> 06:51.679
- You can't breathe?

06:51.679 --> 06:53.346
What?

06:53.346 --> 06:55.215
What does that mean?

06:55.215 --> 06:56.149
- Maybe there's something else

06:56.149 --> 06:56.950
he needs to focus on right now.

06:56.950 --> 06:58.285
- Like what?

06:58.285 --> 07:00.287
- His job, career?

07:00.287 --> 07:01.221
- Career.

07:01.221 --> 07:04.191
He's working for his rich daddy.

07:04.191 --> 07:05.258
It's another girl.

07:05.258 --> 07:06.093
- Really?

07:06.093 --> 07:06.927
- No!

07:06.927 --> 07:08.729
Hey, hey, hey.

07:08.729 --> 07:11.398
It's probably something that
has nothing to do with you.

07:11.398 --> 07:12.332
- Really?

07:12.332 --> 07:13.467
- He's breaking up with you.

07:13.467 --> 07:15.002
- We're not breaking up.

07:15.002 --> 07:16.336
- Come on!

07:16.336 --> 07:20.373
I can't breathe means
there's another girl.

07:20.373 --> 07:21.208
- Really?

07:21.208 --> 07:22.442
- He's a coward.

07:22.442 --> 07:24.244
- It's, maybe this
is a good thing.

07:24.244 --> 07:25.913
- How is this good?

07:25.913 --> 07:27.615
- You can focus on yourself.

07:27.615 --> 07:29.082
- I don't wanna focus on myself.

07:29.082 --> 07:32.152
- You're a strong,
independent woman,

07:32.152 --> 07:33.353
and the second you get to Baylor

07:33.353 --> 07:35.656
you're gonna forget
all about him.

07:35.656 --> 07:38.559
You're gonna see
all the cute guys,

07:39.927 --> 07:43.363
and the beautiful campus,
and you're gonna get

07:43.363 --> 07:46.534
all the classes you want, and
everything's gonna be perfect,

07:46.534 --> 07:47.434
am I right?

07:51.539 --> 07:52.372
No.

07:54.274 --> 07:55.175
You didn't.

07:58.311 --> 08:01.181
- I told Baylor I
wasn't coming last week.

08:01.181 --> 08:02.115
- Are you kidding?

08:02.115 --> 08:03.784
- What were you thinking?

08:03.784 --> 08:05.553
- I was thinking I was gonna
be home planning a wedding,

08:05.553 --> 08:06.820
that's what I was thinking.

08:06.820 --> 08:09.623
- You gave up your
future for a guy!

08:09.623 --> 08:11.391
- I know, okay!

08:11.391 --> 08:12.626
I know!

08:12.626 --> 08:14.027
I know!

08:14.027 --> 08:15.295
I know!

08:15.295 --> 08:18.198
(muffled speaking)

08:18.198 --> 08:20.534
I gave up my future for guy.

08:22.903 --> 08:25.105
- Okay, stop, just stop.

08:25.105 --> 08:27.274
I can't watch you anymore.

08:28.241 --> 08:30.510
- I know what you're gonna do.

08:30.510 --> 08:33.446
You're gonna stay with us.

08:33.446 --> 08:35.347
After the wedding
you can have my room.

08:35.347 --> 08:36.616
It's perfect, really.

08:36.616 --> 08:38.385
- I'm gonna need a
roommate anyways.

08:38.385 --> 08:39.318
- Yeah, what do you say?

08:39.318 --> 08:40.253
- You can't do that, guys.

08:40.253 --> 08:41.388
- You can help plan my wedding.

08:41.388 --> 08:43.490
- I can't, I have to go home.

08:43.490 --> 08:44.424
- [Emily] Come on, it'll be fun.

08:44.424 --> 08:46.259
- You're moving in with us

08:46.259 --> 08:49.429
and you're getting
your life together.

08:52.700 --> 08:55.769
And that is enough
chocolate for you.

08:57.437 --> 08:58.772
- Now what?

08:58.772 --> 09:00.040
- I don't know.

09:02.042 --> 09:04.978
Well, Emily and Ashley, they
said I can move in with them,

09:04.978 --> 09:06.213
so I was thinking--

09:06.213 --> 09:08.315
- No, I think you need
to come back home, see.

09:08.315 --> 09:11.051
Regroup yourself,
find your footing.

09:11.051 --> 09:12.519
- I can't.

09:12.519 --> 09:14.722
- Well you can't stay
here waitin' on that boy.

09:14.722 --> 09:16.423
- Dad, he's not
even gonna be here!

09:16.423 --> 09:17.758
- He's an idiot!

09:19.960 --> 09:22.596
Just come on home, you
can save some money.

09:22.596 --> 09:23.430
- I can't.

09:24.965 --> 09:26.734
It'd be like admitting defeat.

09:26.734 --> 09:28.702
- It's not defeat to regroup.

09:28.702 --> 09:32.372
Look, we can work out
the grad school thing.

09:34.274 --> 09:38.078
Okay, you have to make
your own decisions.

09:38.078 --> 09:39.312
- Thank you.

09:39.312 --> 09:40.447
- Just don't go
chasin' that boy!

09:40.447 --> 09:41.715
- Dad, I'm not.

09:42.883 --> 09:43.717
Okay?

09:45.152 --> 09:47.520
Now are you gonna give me my
graduation present or not?

09:47.520 --> 09:49.857
- Changing the subject, hmm.

09:52.893 --> 09:53.861
Wrapping's a little rough.

09:53.861 --> 09:55.963
- Looks great, I love it.

09:58.198 --> 10:01.034
(paper crinkling)

10:04.404 --> 10:08.976
- I had the stone from your
momma's ring reset for you.

10:10.243 --> 10:11.912
Go ahead, put it on.

10:14.815 --> 10:15.649
- Dad.

10:16.817 --> 10:19.219
(soft music)

10:24.091 --> 10:25.959
- Somethin' else.

10:25.959 --> 10:28.395
- Dad, you did not have
to get me anything else,

10:28.395 --> 10:31.398
The necklace is, it's
more than enough.

10:31.398 --> 10:33.500
- Well, it's not from me.

10:34.534 --> 10:36.503
It's from your mom.

10:36.503 --> 10:40.573
She wrapped it, put it in
the back of the closet,

10:41.775 --> 10:43.076
and she told me
to give it to you

10:43.076 --> 10:45.879
when you graduated
from college, so.

10:45.879 --> 10:46.947
- What is it?

10:47.948 --> 10:49.182
- I don't know.

10:52.452 --> 10:54.221
So you gonna open it?

10:55.588 --> 10:56.824
- I don't know.

11:02.229 --> 11:04.497
(giggling)

11:06.199 --> 11:08.301
- Get over here!

11:08.301 --> 11:11.705
(girls screaming)

11:11.705 --> 11:15.042
You have to open it,
it's from your mom.

11:15.909 --> 11:18.678
- So, what do you think's in it?

11:18.678 --> 11:20.113
- I have no idea.

11:21.014 --> 11:23.183
- What are you afraid of?

11:23.183 --> 11:26.453
- I don't know,
I remember my mom

11:26.453 --> 11:28.388
in a very specific way.

11:29.556 --> 11:32.125
I don't want that to change.

11:32.125 --> 11:34.261
- I guess I'd be a
little nervous too.

11:34.261 --> 11:35.662
- Okay, but what if
what's in the box

11:35.662 --> 11:38.165
makes all the memories better?

11:42.602 --> 11:44.938
I mean, look at that sunset!

11:46.907 --> 11:49.576
Oh come on, you have to open it!

11:50.543 --> 11:51.879
- I'm not ready.

11:53.113 --> 11:56.116
- It's not Pandora's
box, it's your mom.

11:57.851 --> 12:02.122
- What if whatever's in
that box changes everything?

12:05.658 --> 12:08.095
(soft music)

13:22.202 --> 13:23.036
Waitress.

13:24.104 --> 13:24.938
Waitress.

13:26.106 --> 13:27.274
Dog walker.

13:27.274 --> 13:29.242
- You know 73% of
college grads can't find

13:29.242 --> 13:31.378
a job in their field of study.

13:31.378 --> 13:33.813
- We're supposed to
be encouraging her!

13:33.813 --> 13:36.483
- That is encouraging, for her!

13:36.483 --> 13:38.651
- There's nothing in the paper.

13:38.651 --> 13:40.553
- Keep looking,
you'll find something.

13:40.553 --> 13:42.155
- [Ashley] Try a temp agency.

13:42.155 --> 13:43.290
It's a good place to get a job

13:43.290 --> 13:46.193
when you aren't
qualified for anything.

13:46.193 --> 13:47.360
- Thanks.

13:47.360 --> 13:50.330
- Really, that's not a bad idea.

13:50.330 --> 13:51.932
- Okay, let me see.

14:00.207 --> 14:01.041
Oh, look, look.

14:01.041 --> 14:01.875
Here's something.

14:01.875 --> 14:03.376
Job Factory.

14:03.376 --> 14:06.113
Search and interview for your
next job at the Job Factory.

14:06.113 --> 14:09.116
We list hundreds of new
specialized jobs each day.

14:09.116 --> 14:11.251
No experience necessary.

14:11.251 --> 14:12.752
- Perfect!

14:12.752 --> 14:14.387
- Your one stop job search
and interview resource.

14:14.387 --> 14:16.789
Start working here today.

14:16.789 --> 14:19.792
- Okay, close the computer.

14:19.792 --> 14:21.895
You're gonna need to
know how to interview,

14:21.895 --> 14:24.564
and I'm gonna teach you.

14:24.564 --> 14:25.899
It is a science.

14:27.167 --> 14:29.836
I may not know
anything about dating,

14:29.836 --> 14:32.172
but I know everything
about business.

14:32.172 --> 14:34.474
- I just need a job.

14:34.474 --> 14:36.143
- I don't want you
making the same mistakes

14:36.143 --> 14:37.610
that most people make.

14:37.610 --> 14:39.312
- Like what?

14:39.312 --> 14:42.615
- People are chatty, so
try not to talk too much.

14:42.615 --> 14:45.118
And you're gonna wanna
lean forward slightly

14:45.118 --> 14:47.554
and keep eye contact
at all times.

14:47.554 --> 14:48.888
- What?

14:48.888 --> 14:51.191
- Keep eye contact!

14:51.191 --> 14:52.792
Very important.

14:52.792 --> 14:55.862
Shows your confidence
and your power.

14:55.862 --> 14:59.032
- Yeah, and that you
could be a serial killer.

14:59.032 --> 15:01.234
- Alright, let's just try it,

15:01.234 --> 15:03.303
just like you're
being interviewed.

15:03.303 --> 15:04.271
- What do you want me to do?

15:04.271 --> 15:05.605
- Well sit up.

15:05.605 --> 15:06.439
Sit up!

15:06.439 --> 15:08.375
And move your hands.

15:08.375 --> 15:11.144
And lean in, just
a little, stop.

15:12.745 --> 15:16.616
Okay, now when they ask
you a question, you, hey!

15:16.616 --> 15:18.918
You always respond with,

15:18.918 --> 15:22.755
that's a very interesting
question, yeah?

15:22.755 --> 15:24.124
Now relax!

15:24.124 --> 15:26.259
You're a woman,
you're confident.

15:26.259 --> 15:30.130
Yeah, but sit up, look me in
the eye, and lean forward.

15:30.130 --> 15:30.964
Hey! (fingers snapping)

15:30.964 --> 15:31.965
Eye contact.

15:33.166 --> 15:34.701
Now when they ask you
a question you always

15:34.701 --> 15:37.670
repeat the question
before you respond.

15:37.670 --> 15:39.506
Shows your a good
listener and gives

15:39.506 --> 15:42.042
you time to respond
appropriately.

15:42.042 --> 15:44.077
Okay, let's try it.

15:44.077 --> 15:45.145
Hey! (fingers snapping)

15:45.145 --> 15:46.746
Focus, eye contact!

15:48.148 --> 15:52.019
Now, what are your thoughts
on women in leadership?

15:55.055 --> 15:55.888
- What are my--

15:55.888 --> 15:57.024
- No!

15:57.024 --> 15:58.791
That's a very
interesting question.

15:58.791 --> 16:01.428
- That's a very
interesting question.

16:01.428 --> 16:05.098
What are my thoughts
on women in leadership?

16:07.434 --> 16:08.901
- Well you have to
answer the question!

16:08.901 --> 16:10.970
- Okay, that's enough.

16:10.970 --> 16:12.239
You're gonna make
her more nervous.

16:12.239 --> 16:14.807
- Look, I know what
I'm talking about.

16:14.807 --> 16:17.744
- Just be yourself,
you'll be fine.

16:18.611 --> 16:20.013
(phone chiming)

16:20.013 --> 16:21.281
- What, what's wrong?

16:21.281 --> 16:24.184
- Chris' mom wants me to
meet her at her florist.

16:24.184 --> 16:25.018
- Ugh.

16:27.454 --> 16:29.156
- Can somebody
please go with me?

16:29.156 --> 16:31.424
- Emily, when are you
going to stand up to her?

16:31.424 --> 16:32.859
- I already have.

16:32.859 --> 16:33.760
- [Ashley] Mmhmm.

16:33.760 --> 16:34.661
- Wait, where's Chris?

16:34.661 --> 16:36.163
Why can't he go?

16:36.163 --> 16:38.498
- He's going, but I need
one of you guys to go too.

16:38.498 --> 16:43.503
- No, this is your wedding and
you have to stand up to her.

16:44.371 --> 16:46.139
- She plays mind tricks, okay?

16:46.139 --> 16:48.007
She makes me believe
it's what I want.

16:48.007 --> 16:49.342
- Flowers, you want?

16:49.342 --> 16:51.278
My florist you must go.

16:52.179 --> 16:53.113
(laughing)

16:53.113 --> 16:54.847
- No, really, I'm serious.

16:54.847 --> 16:57.350
- No, look, you have
to stand up to her

16:57.350 --> 16:59.986
or she is going to walk
all over you forever.

16:59.986 --> 17:01.521
- I know.

17:01.521 --> 17:05.192
- She is your mother-in-law,
you cannot be afraid of her.

17:05.192 --> 17:07.859
- That is easier said than done.

17:21.708 --> 17:22.541
- Hi.

17:22.541 --> 17:23.776
- Oh, hi.

17:23.776 --> 17:24.911
- First timer?

17:24.911 --> 17:26.378
- Yeah.

17:26.378 --> 17:27.314
- It's nothing to worry about.

17:27.314 --> 17:29.549
It's super easy and awesome.

17:30.883 --> 17:32.819
Just go over the computers,
you pick out the job

17:32.819 --> 17:36.055
that you want, you go in
for the interview, and bam!

17:36.055 --> 17:37.457
You get a job.

17:37.457 --> 17:38.891
- Hmm.

17:38.891 --> 17:43.630
- Like yesterday, I was working
inspecting coffins, right?

17:44.831 --> 17:46.599
I laid down in like
100 of those things

17:46.599 --> 17:47.634
throughout the day, you know?

17:47.634 --> 17:49.336
And at five bucks a pop,

17:49.336 --> 17:53.506
that's more than minimum
wage for a week, right?

17:53.506 --> 17:56.143
Or like last week, I was
working down at the aquarium,

17:56.143 --> 17:57.344
I was helping them separate

17:57.344 --> 17:58.845
the live fish from
the dead fish.

17:58.845 --> 18:02.048
The smell was terrible, but
the pay was fantastic, right?

18:02.048 --> 18:04.284
I was really gettin'
into it too, it was nuts.

18:04.284 --> 18:06.419
I was slingin' those dead
fish into their bucket.

18:06.419 --> 18:08.921
All the other guys, they
were in there going whoa,

18:08.921 --> 18:10.490
slow down man!

18:10.490 --> 18:12.725
This guy's a beast!

18:12.725 --> 18:14.361
A beast.

18:14.361 --> 18:16.796
- So, um, do they list
any normal jobs or just--

18:16.796 --> 18:19.065
- Oh yeah, I have a degree in
theoretical nuclear physics,

18:19.065 --> 18:20.300
I got a couple of those jobs.

18:20.300 --> 18:22.702
But the best part is
it's the adventure

18:22.702 --> 18:25.238
of never knowing what
you're gonna find, you know?

18:25.238 --> 18:26.439
- Mr. Winklehiemer?

18:26.439 --> 18:28.040
There's a computer
ready for you.

18:28.040 --> 18:29.309
- It's my turn.

18:32.279 --> 18:33.346
Bam!

18:33.346 --> 18:34.514
You get a job.

18:54.601 --> 18:57.304
- Ashley, I'm so sorry
to keep you waiting.

18:57.304 --> 18:58.705
It's so good to see you again.

18:58.705 --> 19:00.106
We're so glad to have
you join our team.

19:00.106 --> 19:01.508
- Well I cannot
wait to get started.

19:01.508 --> 19:02.909
- Good, that's what
I like to hear.

19:02.909 --> 19:03.743
This is Diane.

19:03.743 --> 19:04.577
- Hi, nice to meet you.

19:04.577 --> 19:05.412
- Hello.

19:05.412 --> 19:07.046
- Have a seat.

19:07.046 --> 19:08.281
I was telling Diane last week

19:08.281 --> 19:10.650
how lucky was are to
have snatched you up.

19:10.650 --> 19:12.084
- Oh.

19:12.084 --> 19:14.721
- I told her that you
remind me of me at your age.

19:14.721 --> 19:16.189
- Thank you, Ma'am.

19:16.189 --> 19:19.726
This is my dream job
and I just wanna learn

19:19.726 --> 19:21.494
about the business
and work my way up

19:21.494 --> 19:22.529
as quickly as possible.

19:22.529 --> 19:23.763
- Perfect.

19:23.763 --> 19:25.398
Diane, you better watch out.

19:25.398 --> 19:26.799
This one's a real go-getter.

19:26.799 --> 19:28.301
- Yes, I know.

19:28.301 --> 19:29.236
- Did I tell you that she
was first in her class?

19:29.236 --> 19:30.803
- Yes ma'am, I believe you did.

19:30.803 --> 19:32.038
- Well, okay.

19:32.038 --> 19:33.540
Ashley, you'll be
working with Diane.

19:33.540 --> 19:36.343
She will show you the ropes
and take very good care of you.

19:36.343 --> 19:37.844
Unfortunately, we
have a client call

19:37.844 --> 19:39.679
that both she and
I need to jump on,

19:39.679 --> 19:40.980
but Diane will show you around

19:40.980 --> 19:42.382
once we get finished
with the call.

19:42.382 --> 19:43.616
- Sounds great.

19:43.616 --> 19:44.851
- Would you like
to look at a pitch

19:44.851 --> 19:45.385
presentation while
you're waiting?

19:45.385 --> 19:46.219
- Yes!

19:47.119 --> 19:49.456
Thank you, this is amazing.

19:49.456 --> 19:50.723
Thank you.

19:50.723 --> 19:52.259
- Fantastic.

19:52.259 --> 19:55.395
- Thank you, so much,
again for this opportunity.

19:55.395 --> 19:57.129
- The pleasure is ours,
and if you need anything,

19:57.129 --> 19:59.031
my door is always open.

20:00.066 --> 20:01.968
- Yes ma'am, follow me.

20:03.903 --> 20:05.972
- That's why I'm leaning
towards the orchids.

20:05.972 --> 20:08.441
You just don't see
these every day.

20:08.441 --> 20:11.978
- That seems like
a lot of orchids.

20:11.978 --> 20:14.146
They probably couldn't
find that many.

20:14.146 --> 20:15.382
- Of course.

20:15.382 --> 20:16.215
Tiffy!

20:17.350 --> 20:19.185
Uh, Tiffy, do you
think that we could do

20:19.185 --> 20:20.653
the whole church in orchids?

20:20.653 --> 20:22.389
- Oh, honey, if
that's what you want,

20:22.389 --> 20:23.923
we will make it happen.

20:23.923 --> 20:25.124
Even if we have to
bring in the orchids

20:25.124 --> 20:26.726
from all over the country.

20:26.726 --> 20:28.828
- That sounds expensive.

20:28.828 --> 20:31.398
- Well, you got
expensive tastes, dear.

20:31.398 --> 20:32.599
- Let's do this one.

20:32.599 --> 20:34.334
- Excellent choice,
I'll work it up.

20:34.334 --> 20:35.902
- Great, thank you.

20:37.970 --> 20:39.171
- Hey, sorry I'm late.

20:39.171 --> 20:40.239
- Hi, hi.

20:40.239 --> 20:42.141
- Good to see you.

20:42.141 --> 20:44.076
So did you all
make some progress?

20:44.076 --> 20:45.345
- Absolutely.

20:45.345 --> 20:47.213
- Great, did you
talk to the caterer?

20:47.213 --> 20:48.781
- Oh yes.

20:48.781 --> 20:51.918
Pierre, he's going to deliver
a spectacular sit down dinner

20:51.918 --> 20:54.421
and our guests will
have plenty of choices.

20:54.421 --> 20:56.289
Fully staffed, of course.

20:56.289 --> 20:57.557
- Great.

20:57.557 --> 20:58.558
- And he's got the
date available,

20:58.558 --> 21:00.126
which means it's a miracle.

21:00.126 --> 21:01.294
- We really just
wanted a little buffet.

21:01.294 --> 21:02.228
- And the flowers, Tiffy's gonna

21:02.228 --> 21:03.863
take care of the flowers, okay?

21:03.863 --> 21:06.933
So she says the orchids are
gonna be absolutely fabulous.

21:06.933 --> 21:09.101
- Chris and I want
things to be simple.

21:09.101 --> 21:11.237
- Of course you do.

21:11.237 --> 21:14.707
She's just so
practical and so smart.

21:14.707 --> 21:16.709
- This is just too much.

21:18.411 --> 21:19.912
- Well, of course.

21:21.147 --> 21:22.214
I understand.

21:23.215 --> 21:24.984
- Thank you, Beverly.

21:24.984 --> 21:26.819
- But I just can't help myself!

21:26.819 --> 21:29.889
So Leonard and I are
gonna pay for everything!

21:29.889 --> 21:30.957
- Really?

21:30.957 --> 21:32.124
Mom, are you sure?

21:32.124 --> 21:33.993
- Absolutely, it
would be our pleasure.

21:33.993 --> 21:35.495
- We can't let you do that.

21:35.495 --> 21:37.630
- That's it, there's no
more discussion about it.

21:37.630 --> 21:38.598
It's settled.

21:38.598 --> 21:39.799
Tiffy's gonna do the flowers

21:39.799 --> 21:42.068
and Pierre's got that
spectacular menu.

21:42.068 --> 21:43.436
- [Chris] Great.

21:43.436 --> 21:45.938
- I promise, it'll be perfect.

21:47.974 --> 21:49.842
- Miss Miller, what
jobs were you interested

21:49.842 --> 21:51.511
in looking at today?

21:53.813 --> 21:56.416
- Oh, um, McMillan and Schneid.

21:59.318 --> 22:02.154
- Oh, McMillan and Schneid.

22:02.154 --> 22:04.557
Now, I'm going to ask
you a series of questions

22:04.557 --> 22:06.158
and I want you to look
right here into the camera

22:06.158 --> 22:08.795
and I want you to answer
as honestly as possible.

22:08.795 --> 22:09.629
Alright?

22:13.566 --> 22:18.237
Now, if you were a tree, what
kind of tree would you be?

22:21.173 --> 22:23.242
- That's an
interesting question.

22:23.242 --> 22:26.946
If I were a tree, what
type of tree would I be?

22:26.946 --> 22:28.715
Hmm, okay, I'm sorry.

22:30.249 --> 22:32.419
Is this for the filing job, I--

22:32.419 --> 22:33.853
- Yes, yes it is.

22:35.021 --> 22:37.223
You know, any kind
of tree at all.

22:37.223 --> 22:39.325
Oak, apple, maple, maybe?

22:44.564 --> 22:45.398
Moving on.

22:46.466 --> 22:47.900
- Sorry.

22:47.900 --> 22:49.702
- If you were a cheeseburger,

22:49.702 --> 22:53.272
what part of the
cheeseburger would you be?

22:55.608 --> 22:57.610
- That's another
interesting question.

22:57.610 --> 22:59.278
Thank you for asking.

22:59.278 --> 23:03.550
If I were part of a cheeseburger,
I'd be the lettuce.

23:05.585 --> 23:06.385
- The lettuce?

23:06.385 --> 23:08.254
- [Jessica] Yes.

23:08.254 --> 23:11.524
- Why would you be the lettuce?

23:11.524 --> 23:12.358
- Why?

23:16.395 --> 23:18.364
Um, because the lettuce...

23:18.364 --> 23:21.000
You know, I'm not
quite sure what

23:21.000 --> 23:23.436
the purpose of the lettuce is.

23:23.436 --> 23:25.905
It doesn't really
have much taste.

23:25.905 --> 23:28.307
It's green, and I love green.

23:29.208 --> 23:31.811
I think we should all go green.

23:33.212 --> 23:34.547
- Miss Miller...

23:35.782 --> 23:37.249
- What?

23:37.249 --> 23:41.420
- You seem like a very
nice girl, very sweet girl.

23:44.256 --> 23:48.194
But you're not ready for
all of this, you know.

23:48.194 --> 23:52.932
Maybe you can come back again
and aim a little bit lower.

23:55.101 --> 23:58.938
- Well, what happened
to everybody gets a job?

24:00.372 --> 24:04.744
- New jobs every day, new
opportunities every day.

24:04.744 --> 24:07.346
So come back again tomorrow.

24:07.346 --> 24:08.180
Next!

24:12.184 --> 24:13.586
- Ready?

24:13.586 --> 24:14.987
- Oh, absolutely.

24:15.855 --> 24:18.525
(hopeful music)

24:27.099 --> 24:28.868
- This is the file room.

24:28.868 --> 24:31.604
All the contracts,
invoices, deal memos,

24:31.604 --> 24:34.841
pitch plans, everything
from 2001 to 2010

24:34.841 --> 24:36.843
is contained in these boxes.

24:36.843 --> 24:40.613
We need to convert everything
from paper to digital files.

24:40.613 --> 24:42.882
So your assignment is to
manage that conversion.

24:42.882 --> 24:45.484
- Oh, great, how do I do that?

24:45.484 --> 24:48.054
- You open the file, take
out every piece of paper

24:48.054 --> 24:50.356
and scan it to the server.

24:50.356 --> 24:53.359
- You said I was
managing the conversion.

24:53.359 --> 24:54.627
Who am I going to
be working with?

24:54.627 --> 24:55.461
- No one.

24:57.496 --> 24:59.198
- I think Miss
Brockman wanted me--

24:59.198 --> 25:00.633
- She said that you work for me.

25:00.633 --> 25:02.001
This is the assignment.

25:02.001 --> 25:03.736
Do we have a problem?

25:04.904 --> 25:06.405
- No.

25:06.405 --> 25:09.075
- [Diane] Good, start with 2001.

25:28.961 --> 25:30.462
- Gracie, Jessica!

25:40.640 --> 25:43.643
- Chocolate, it's
good for the soul.

26:16.408 --> 26:18.444
- Hi, um, I think you must

26:18.444 --> 26:21.313
have grabbed my
drink by accident.

26:21.313 --> 26:25.818
- There are no accidents,
honey, only the Lord's will.

26:27.086 --> 26:29.588
Uh, would you care to join me?

26:31.390 --> 26:35.662
- Um, I'm actually looking at
papers and stuff right now.

26:35.662 --> 26:37.429
- Tough job market, huh?

26:37.429 --> 26:38.798
- Yeah.

26:38.798 --> 26:40.532
- Did you just graduate?

26:40.532 --> 26:42.601
- Is it that obvious?

26:42.601 --> 26:44.904
- You've got that
panicky look that I see

26:44.904 --> 26:47.840
in a lot of young
people nowadays.

26:47.840 --> 26:49.608
Would you please sit?

26:51.177 --> 26:54.080
Just for a moment,
just for a moment.

26:54.080 --> 26:54.914
- Okay.

26:57.083 --> 26:58.550
- I'm Gracie.

26:58.550 --> 26:59.385
- Hi, I'm--

26:59.385 --> 27:00.219
- Jessica.

27:02.521 --> 27:03.355
- Thanks.

27:04.691 --> 27:08.294
- So, what kind of job
are you looking for?

27:09.461 --> 27:10.697
- I don't know.

27:11.831 --> 27:13.399
I'm not really qualified
for anything, so.

27:13.399 --> 27:15.434
- That's nonsense!

27:15.434 --> 27:18.938
Getting your college degree
is a wonderful thing.

27:18.938 --> 27:21.573
It shows that you
have commitment

27:21.573 --> 27:25.745
and that you can see
things through to the end.

27:25.745 --> 27:26.578
- I guess.

27:28.014 --> 27:32.685
- As luck would have it, I
am in need of an assistant.

27:33.886 --> 27:35.788
Now, it wouldn't be
anything long term,

27:35.788 --> 27:38.057
but it would give you something

27:38.057 --> 27:40.392
while you're looking
for a permanent job.

27:40.392 --> 27:41.694
- That's really sweet
of you, but um--

27:41.694 --> 27:45.464
- And you'd be helping
out a crazy old woman.

27:45.464 --> 27:47.366
(laughing)

27:47.366 --> 27:49.869
- You're not that old, surely.

27:51.037 --> 27:53.405
- So you're saying
that I'm crazy?

27:53.405 --> 27:56.575
- No, that's not
what I'm saying.

27:56.575 --> 27:58.177
- I know, I'm just kidding.

27:58.177 --> 27:59.111
- Okay.

27:59.111 --> 28:00.279
- (chuckling) I'm just kidding.

28:00.279 --> 28:02.248
Oh, and this is my son, Tyler.

28:02.248 --> 28:03.816
Tyler, this is Jessica.

28:03.816 --> 28:04.683
- Nice to meet you.

28:04.683 --> 28:06.352
- Nice to meet you.

28:06.352 --> 28:07.686
- Did you renew my tags?

28:07.686 --> 28:09.088
- Yes, Mama, I did.

28:09.088 --> 28:10.723
But I don't know why you
wanna pay that money,

28:10.723 --> 28:13.059
you don't even drive.

28:13.059 --> 28:15.527
- No, I don't drive anymore.

28:15.527 --> 28:18.397
However, I do like
having my own car.

28:18.397 --> 28:22.701
One never knows when one
might have need of it.

28:22.701 --> 28:24.103
- Alright, well I
gotta get you home

28:24.103 --> 28:25.571
and get back to work.

28:25.571 --> 28:29.408
- Jessica, here's my phone
number and my address.

28:32.278 --> 28:36.282
Why don't you stop by
tomorrow maybe around nine

28:38.350 --> 28:40.419
and just take a look around.

28:40.419 --> 28:43.722
If you like it,
you've got a job.

28:43.722 --> 28:45.524
And if you don't,
I'll send you home

28:45.524 --> 28:47.693
with a good cup of coffee.

28:49.661 --> 28:50.529
- It was nice to meet you.

28:50.529 --> 28:52.298
- You too, thank you.

28:53.632 --> 28:55.167
- [Tyler] Let's go.

28:55.167 --> 28:57.603
(soft music)

29:13.752 --> 29:17.023
- Oh, hey, how'd it
go with Chris' mom?

29:19.826 --> 29:21.060
That good, huh?

29:36.876 --> 29:39.745
- Jess, this place is a wreck.

29:39.745 --> 29:40.579
Ugh.

29:49.788 --> 29:53.459
- I bombed my interviews,
thanks for asking.

29:59.765 --> 30:03.102
(soft melancholy music)

30:21.220 --> 30:23.122
- The beautiful queen
and her princess daughter

30:23.122 --> 30:25.224
were inside the
magnificent palace

30:25.224 --> 30:28.394
baking cookies together
and singing songs,

30:28.394 --> 30:30.162
like best friends do.

30:32.965 --> 30:35.001
The queen turned to
the princess and said,

30:35.001 --> 30:37.669
one day a handsome
prince will come along

30:37.669 --> 30:39.838
and offer to make you his queen.

30:39.838 --> 30:42.141
Then you will travel
to a far away land

30:42.141 --> 30:46.112
and be the caretaker
of a great people.

30:46.112 --> 30:48.080
The princess looked
at the queen and said,

30:48.080 --> 30:49.848
I don't believe I can do it.

30:49.848 --> 30:52.551
The queen smiled her
special smile and said,

30:52.551 --> 30:54.386
of course you can, my darling.

30:54.386 --> 30:56.155
You are just like me.

30:58.157 --> 30:59.691
No mother, said the princess,

30:59.691 --> 31:01.060
I could never leave you.

31:01.060 --> 31:03.029
We will be together forever.

31:03.029 --> 31:05.898
The queen looked at her
with a happy smile and said,

31:05.898 --> 31:08.500
we will always be
together in our hearts.

31:08.500 --> 31:12.939
The queen hugged her like
she would never let her go.

31:17.276 --> 31:18.344
What?

31:18.344 --> 31:19.845
You don't like it?

31:23.015 --> 31:24.116
- I love you.

31:25.918 --> 31:28.054
You are such a beautiful writer.

31:28.054 --> 31:29.188
- You like it?

31:29.188 --> 31:30.189
- I love it.

31:36.495 --> 31:39.831
(soft melancholy music)

32:01.053 --> 32:03.990
(phone ringing)

32:03.990 --> 32:05.357
- [Josh] Hey, this is Josh.

32:05.357 --> 32:07.359
If it's a dire emergency,
leave a message.

32:07.359 --> 32:09.028
If not, just leave.

32:09.028 --> 32:10.862
(voicemail beeping)

32:10.862 --> 32:12.031
- Hi, it's me.

32:13.465 --> 32:16.235
Um, yeah, you must have
fallen asleep last night.

32:16.235 --> 32:17.236
That's fine.

32:18.404 --> 32:19.838
You're probably on
the plane right now.

32:19.838 --> 32:21.807
I just wanted to say I
hope you have a safe flight

32:21.807 --> 32:24.610
and you can text
me when you land.

32:26.678 --> 32:27.579
I love you.

32:29.215 --> 32:30.616
- Give him some time.

32:30.616 --> 32:31.550
He'll come around.

32:31.550 --> 32:33.919
- He doesn't deserve you.

32:33.919 --> 32:35.821
- What is that?

32:35.821 --> 32:37.489
- What do you think?

32:38.857 --> 32:40.326
- I think Hillary Clinton
wants her suit back.

32:40.326 --> 32:41.260
- Whatever.

32:41.260 --> 32:42.861
I'm trying to make a statement.

32:42.861 --> 32:45.131
I'm a professional woman.

32:45.131 --> 32:46.765
- Mission accomplished.

32:46.765 --> 32:47.766
- Thank you.

32:49.235 --> 32:53.072
I wasn't ranked first in
my class to be copy girl.

32:56.242 --> 32:57.443
- Ew!

32:57.443 --> 32:58.277
Who made this?

32:58.277 --> 32:59.578
- I did.

32:59.578 --> 33:01.180
- I thought you said you
knew how to make coffee?

33:01.180 --> 33:03.282
- How hard can it be?

33:03.282 --> 33:04.616
- Whatever.

33:04.616 --> 33:07.286
Don't let Chris' mother
walk all over you.

33:07.286 --> 33:09.855
Remember, this is your wedding.

33:09.855 --> 33:10.756
- Right.

33:10.756 --> 33:12.091
- And you.

33:12.091 --> 33:14.093
Get out of this funk!

33:14.093 --> 33:15.794
I want my best friend back.

33:15.794 --> 33:17.096
- We're still on
for lunch, right?

33:17.096 --> 33:17.996
- [Ashley] I'll be there.

33:17.996 --> 33:19.431
- Me too.

33:19.431 --> 33:22.501
(soft hopeful music)

33:36.115 --> 33:39.017
(knocking on door)

33:54.166 --> 33:55.634
- Well hello, young lady.

33:55.634 --> 33:57.203
You're not quittin'
already, are ya?

33:57.203 --> 33:58.470
- Uh, no ma'am.

33:58.470 --> 34:00.272
- Oh no, let's not
start with that

34:00.272 --> 34:01.873
yes ma'am or no ma'am nonsense.

34:01.873 --> 34:02.874
Just Gracie.

34:04.443 --> 34:05.377
Come on in.

34:23.962 --> 34:24.830
(camera clicking and buzzing)

34:24.830 --> 34:26.498
My son's idea.

34:26.498 --> 34:29.368
I seem to forget
things sometimes.

34:29.368 --> 34:30.768
(laughing)

34:30.768 --> 34:33.438
Oh, that's a good one, look!

34:33.438 --> 34:35.005
Put it right there.

34:36.408 --> 34:37.409
Who are you?

34:38.310 --> 34:39.145
- Oh, um--

34:39.145 --> 34:40.612
- Just kidding.

34:40.612 --> 34:43.349
Not really, sometimes I may
actually do that to you.

34:43.349 --> 34:44.616
(laughing)

34:44.616 --> 34:45.451
What was your major?

34:45.451 --> 34:47.886
- Uh, ancient languages.

34:47.886 --> 34:50.489
- [Gracie] What would
you do with that?

34:50.489 --> 34:52.023
- Uh, well, um--

34:52.023 --> 34:55.761
- [Gracie] Hey, how 'bout
let's have some coffee, huh?

34:55.761 --> 34:56.594
Come on.

34:56.594 --> 34:57.429
- Okay.

35:00.031 --> 35:02.334
- You're a beautiful
young woman.

35:02.334 --> 35:04.836
I'll bet you take
after your mother.

35:04.836 --> 35:06.472
- I don't know.

35:06.472 --> 35:08.374
I like to think so.

35:08.374 --> 35:10.942
- Do you spend a lot
of time with her?

35:10.942 --> 35:15.781
- No, um, my mom died
when I was nine, actually.

35:15.781 --> 35:18.284
- Oh, honey, oh, I'm so sorry.

35:20.519 --> 35:24.290
It's a horrible age
to lose your mom.

35:24.290 --> 35:27.793
I lost mine too when I
was a very young girl.

35:27.793 --> 35:29.661
There's nothing like
a mother's love.

35:29.661 --> 35:30.596
- No ma'am.

35:31.930 --> 35:33.199
I mean, Gracie.

35:34.099 --> 35:34.933
Sorry.

35:36.335 --> 35:39.338
- For I know the plans I
have for you, says the Lord.

35:39.338 --> 35:42.107
Plans to prosper you
and not to harm you.

35:42.107 --> 35:45.977
Plans to give you hope
and build a future.

35:45.977 --> 35:47.213
Jeremiah 29:11.

35:48.380 --> 35:51.049
Can't hear too much
of that, nowadays.

35:51.049 --> 35:53.552
God watches over his children.

35:56.455 --> 35:59.891
You've got the job,
if you want it.

35:59.891 --> 36:01.393
- I do, thank you.

36:01.393 --> 36:02.928
- Don't thank me yet.

36:02.928 --> 36:05.096
You don't know what it is.

36:08.467 --> 36:09.701
Are you comin'?

36:11.203 --> 36:12.037
- Yeah!

36:30.121 --> 36:32.358
- It's filthy up here.

36:32.358 --> 36:34.293
- I love old attics.

36:34.293 --> 36:38.364
- Yeah, there's a lot
of memories up here.

36:38.364 --> 36:39.898
Ton of memories.

36:39.898 --> 36:41.667
- Sure looks like it.

36:42.868 --> 36:45.637
- I've lived in this
house for 45 years.

36:45.637 --> 36:49.341
The last 10 has been by myself
since my Richard passed.

36:49.341 --> 36:52.711
But I've got to get
this place organized.

36:52.711 --> 36:54.513
Now there's some clothing
that's scattered about

36:54.513 --> 36:57.916
that I wanna get
boxed up for Goodwill.

36:57.916 --> 36:59.150
- Okay.

36:59.150 --> 37:00.386
No problem.

37:00.386 --> 37:02.954
- And I'm looking for
something in the house,

37:02.954 --> 37:05.190
but I believe it's up here.

37:06.625 --> 37:07.726
- What is it?

37:10.662 --> 37:11.930
- I don't know.

37:14.833 --> 37:17.369
It was something that my son
gave to me a long time ago,

37:17.369 --> 37:21.707
but for the life of me I
can't remember what it was.

37:24.410 --> 37:28.246
But, it sounds crazy,
but I've got to find it.

37:31.249 --> 37:35.621
But I just can't get up and
down in here the way I used to.

37:35.621 --> 37:37.856
So, can you start tomorrow.

37:41.560 --> 37:42.394
- Yes.

37:42.394 --> 37:43.695
- Good.

37:43.695 --> 37:45.597
Tomorrow then.

37:45.597 --> 37:47.833
- So, what's the big surprise?

37:47.833 --> 37:49.000
- I got a job.

37:49.000 --> 37:49.835
- What?

37:49.835 --> 37:51.036
That's great!

37:51.036 --> 37:53.372
- I told you, eye
contact is the secret.

37:53.372 --> 37:54.573
What is it?

37:54.573 --> 37:58.143
- I'm helping this lady
organize her house.

37:58.143 --> 37:59.411
- Nice.

37:59.411 --> 38:00.746
- Yeah, she's this
really sweet lady,

38:00.746 --> 38:03.148
she has an awesome
spirit about her.

38:03.148 --> 38:04.483
I really like her.

38:04.483 --> 38:06.685
- Well, at least one
of us likes our job.

38:06.685 --> 38:08.119
I spent all morning in a cave

38:08.119 --> 38:10.589
feeding documents
into a scanner.

38:10.589 --> 38:12.223
- You're just paying your dues.

38:12.223 --> 38:15.561
- This woman, Diane,
she's my supervisor.

38:15.561 --> 38:17.262
She's just intimidated by me.

38:17.262 --> 38:19.064
- Maybe you should talk to her.

38:19.064 --> 38:20.699
- [Emily] Maybe they're
just testing you.

38:20.699 --> 38:22.601
- No, the owner
likes me and knows

38:22.601 --> 38:24.336
that I know what
I'm talking about.

38:24.336 --> 38:25.571
- Take her a gift.

38:25.571 --> 38:28.106
- Maybe you should
just do the job.

38:28.106 --> 38:29.875
- Wait, what'd you say?

38:29.875 --> 38:31.777
- Like a gift,
take her something.

38:31.777 --> 38:33.612
- What, flowers?

38:33.612 --> 38:34.680
That's weird.

38:35.881 --> 38:38.249
- Well, I, Mrs. Brockman
gave me the presentation

38:38.249 --> 38:41.286
for this Hawaiian travel
site and I tried pitching

38:41.286 --> 38:45.524
my ideas do Diane, and
she's just threatened by me.

38:47.393 --> 38:50.328
- Why don't you take her
Macadamia nuts, yeah?

38:50.328 --> 38:52.664
Like Hawaii, Macadamia nuts?

38:53.965 --> 38:54.800
- No.

38:54.800 --> 38:56.034
- Yeah.

38:56.034 --> 38:57.603
- (laughing) That's
not professional.

38:57.603 --> 39:00.639
- I don't know,
might be worth a try.

39:02.007 --> 39:05.444
- Well, I have to
get back to work.

39:05.444 --> 39:07.379
- Wait, who's gonna
help me with Chris' mom?

39:07.379 --> 39:09.415
She's meeting me here
to talk about cakes.

39:09.415 --> 39:10.782
- [Jessica] I thought your
mom was making the cake?

39:10.782 --> 39:12.350
- Exactly.

39:12.350 --> 39:14.152
- The Bluegrass Baking Company.

39:14.152 --> 39:15.687
It is fabulous!

39:15.687 --> 39:18.356
They do all the biggest
events in the city.

39:18.356 --> 39:20.692
Look, three tiers
on either side,

39:20.692 --> 39:23.395
with bridges and a fountain.

39:23.395 --> 39:24.663
Ooh, and look at this.

39:24.663 --> 39:25.931
- Wow, that's actually--

39:25.931 --> 39:27.198
- Elegant, but oh,
just as fabulous.

39:27.198 --> 39:28.534
- That's actually
really incredible.

39:28.534 --> 39:31.503
- Beverly, my mom agreed
to have the wedding here

39:31.503 --> 39:34.840
instead of at home, but she
really wants to make the cake.

39:34.840 --> 39:36.374
She's an amazing cook.

39:36.374 --> 39:39.010
- Oh, honey, we don't
wanna burden her with that.

39:39.010 --> 39:42.581
I'm sure we can find something
just as special right here.

39:42.581 --> 39:43.982
And don't you worry
about the cost.

39:43.982 --> 39:45.216
- Is this even real?

39:45.216 --> 39:46.051
Is that real?

39:46.051 --> 39:46.985
- I mean honestly.

39:46.985 --> 39:48.186
- That looks, it looks fake.

39:48.186 --> 39:49.688
- It is, it's so terrific.

39:49.688 --> 39:51.490
- I am totally
using this place--

39:51.490 --> 39:55.060
- But making the cake is my
mom's way of being a part of it.

39:55.060 --> 39:56.728
She can't do more.

39:56.728 --> 39:58.797
- Oh, I know, sweetie,
and we are just

39:58.797 --> 40:00.832
so fortunate to be
able to help you,

40:00.832 --> 40:01.967
and we're happy to do it.

40:01.967 --> 40:02.968
And I know your mother wants

40:02.968 --> 40:04.470
the very best for you and Chris.

40:04.470 --> 40:06.004
So do I.

40:06.004 --> 40:06.805
- [Jessica] I've just never
seen anything so beautiful.

40:06.805 --> 40:08.039
- Isn't it incredible?

40:08.039 --> 40:09.274
Look, this was at the
governor's birthday.

40:09.274 --> 40:10.509
Oh, and then there's
another one right here

40:10.509 --> 40:12.644
that you can, just
imagine this--

40:12.644 --> 40:13.545
- [Jessica] I'm going
to use this place.

40:13.545 --> 40:14.580
I'm going to.

40:14.580 --> 40:16.014
- [Beverly] Isn't it great?

40:16.014 --> 40:16.815
- [Jessica] It's beautiful,
it's art, this is art.

40:16.815 --> 40:18.684
- [Beverly] Fabulous.

40:18.684 --> 40:21.352
(playful music)

40:24.355 --> 40:25.724
- Knock knock.

40:25.724 --> 40:26.658
- Oh, Ashley.

40:26.658 --> 40:27.826
- I was hoping we could talk

40:27.826 --> 40:30.328
for a minute if you have time?

40:31.930 --> 40:36.201
See, I think we got
off on the wrong foot.

40:36.201 --> 40:37.669
- How do you mean?

40:37.669 --> 40:40.972
- I know converting the
documents is really important,

40:40.972 --> 40:43.475
but I was just hoping, maybe,

40:43.475 --> 40:46.678
we could work together
on the Hawaii project?

40:46.678 --> 40:48.146
I've been churning
some ideas that I think

40:48.146 --> 40:50.616
would supplement
yours really well,

40:50.616 --> 40:54.052
and so as a peace
offering and in a spirit

40:54.052 --> 40:56.988
of collaboration,
I got you a gift.

41:02.160 --> 41:04.395
Macadamia nuts from Hawaii.

41:07.699 --> 41:09.067
- Is this a joke?

41:09.067 --> 41:09.901
- No.

41:11.737 --> 41:13.739
- I'm allergic to nuts.

41:13.739 --> 41:15.340
I would go into
anaphylactic shock

41:15.340 --> 41:18.510
if I even touched
one of those things.

41:19.711 --> 41:22.380
Your assignment is to
complete the scanning.

41:22.380 --> 41:23.715
That is the job.

41:24.883 --> 41:26.384
Unless you want me
to tell Ms. Brockman

41:26.384 --> 41:28.620
that you are refusing to do
the task assigned to you,

41:28.620 --> 41:30.856
I suggest that you
get that off my desk,

41:30.856 --> 41:34.325
march back downstairs,
and get back to work.

41:34.325 --> 41:35.326
- Yes ma'am.

41:36.461 --> 41:37.395
I wasn't refusing--

41:37.395 --> 41:38.530
- The only sound I want to hear

41:38.530 --> 41:41.132
is your footsteps walking away.

41:46.337 --> 41:49.741
(birds chirping faintly)

42:23.141 --> 42:25.644
(happy music)

42:34.653 --> 42:36.722
(laughing)

42:36.722 --> 42:37.923
- You look gorgeous!

42:37.923 --> 42:39.591
- Gorgeous, darling.

42:41.092 --> 42:42.994
(imitates kissing)

42:42.994 --> 42:45.263
(laughing)

42:48.900 --> 42:50.736
- [Gracie] Jessica,
it's time for a break!

42:50.736 --> 42:51.637
- Um, okay!

42:52.871 --> 42:54.539
I'll be right there.

♪ I hear some beauty

favorite spot.

43:52.530 --> 43:56.467
I still come here to sit,
to remember, to pray.

44:00.571 --> 44:01.940
- It's beautiful.

44:01.940 --> 44:02.774
- Mhmm.

44:04.542 --> 44:08.880
So, Miss Jessica, what are
you doing working for me?

44:13.018 --> 44:16.087
- I'm helping you get organized.

44:16.087 --> 44:18.924
- But what are you waiting for?

44:18.924 --> 44:20.491
- What do you mean?

44:21.927 --> 44:25.163
- Life, life isn't
something that stops

44:27.899 --> 44:30.702
if things don't go your way.

44:30.702 --> 44:33.872
It doesn't wait for you
to catch your breath,

44:33.872 --> 44:37.943
it goes on, it continues
on with or without us.

44:37.943 --> 44:39.510
And all the problems,
all the issues,

44:39.510 --> 44:43.014
all the hardships,
they're not stop signs.

44:44.515 --> 44:46.084
They're guidelines.

44:47.585 --> 44:49.921
It's time for you to wake up

44:53.058 --> 44:57.228
and live the life that God
planned for you, today.

45:00.131 --> 45:02.333
- What does that even mean?

45:08.306 --> 45:12.710
- I know that one day soon
I won't remember who I am.

45:21.152 --> 45:24.055
I will forget all
of my loved ones.

45:26.825 --> 45:31.830
I won't remember the freshness
or a promise of a spring day.

45:34.099 --> 45:37.836
I won't even remember
what my son's hair

45:37.836 --> 45:39.470
smelled like after
his first bath,

45:39.470 --> 45:43.641
and I won't remember
Richard's kisses on my cheek.

45:50.081 --> 45:53.018
And I'm at peace with that.

45:53.018 --> 45:57.823
I'm at peace because, I'm
at peace with my creator

45:57.823 --> 46:00.625
because I know how
the story ends.

46:02.327 --> 46:03.862
- Yeah.

46:03.862 --> 46:06.865
- I know that my
life has a purpose,

46:09.200 --> 46:12.537
and that that purpose
will be fulfilled.

46:13.939 --> 46:18.343
Just like God had a purpose
for your mother's life,

46:18.343 --> 46:20.411
and he has one for yours.

46:23.681 --> 46:26.584
- I wish my purpose
was more clear.

46:28.386 --> 46:30.488
- Mom, you are gonna be late
for your doctor's appointment.

46:30.488 --> 46:32.757
- Oh, Dr. McClaine can
wait on me for a change.

46:32.757 --> 46:33.691
- Where are you goin'?

46:33.691 --> 46:34.725
- I'm goin' to get my sweater.

46:34.725 --> 46:35.693
It's always cold in that office.

46:35.693 --> 46:37.762
- Hey, hey, hey, I'll get it.

46:37.762 --> 46:41.099
- I'm not dead yet,
I can get it myself.

46:45.303 --> 46:46.804
- She's quite a woman.

46:46.804 --> 46:48.806
- Ah, yes she is.

46:48.806 --> 46:50.008
She likes to keep
you off balanced.

46:50.008 --> 46:50.842
- I noticed.

46:50.842 --> 46:51.776
- Yeah.

46:51.776 --> 46:52.978
How's she doin' with you?

46:52.978 --> 46:53.811
- She's good.

46:53.811 --> 46:54.880
- Good, good.

46:56.081 --> 46:58.416
Um, you know, she
tries to hide it,

46:58.416 --> 47:01.186
but she knows she's
getting worse.

47:02.220 --> 47:04.222
- She seems good with me.

47:04.222 --> 47:06.391
She talks about you a lot.

47:09.060 --> 47:10.295
- This is hard.

47:13.098 --> 47:15.066
If she ever has a
spell, give me a call.

47:15.066 --> 47:17.002
My number's on the refrigerator
in big red letters.

47:17.002 --> 47:18.236
- I saw it.

47:18.236 --> 47:19.604
I will.

47:19.604 --> 47:20.605
- Thank you.

47:27.645 --> 47:30.481
- Come on, don't wanna be late.

47:30.481 --> 47:32.918
(soft music)

47:42.460 --> 47:45.964
- Thank you, Jerry,
you will not be sorry.

47:51.602 --> 47:52.437
- Miss Brockman.

47:52.437 --> 47:53.404
- Yes, Angie.

47:53.404 --> 47:55.006
- Uh, Ashley, ma'am.

47:55.006 --> 47:56.908
- Yes, of course, Ashley.

47:56.908 --> 47:58.376
Is everything going
well with you?

47:58.376 --> 48:00.811
- That's actually what I
wanted to talk to you about.

48:00.811 --> 48:03.014
- I am late for a client dinner.

48:03.014 --> 48:06.051
- Of course, could I maybe
talk to you tomorrow then?

48:06.051 --> 48:08.519
- Have Sara my assistant
set something up.

48:08.519 --> 48:09.988
What is this about?

48:09.988 --> 48:12.357
- Diane and what
she has me doing.

48:12.357 --> 48:14.225
- Tell Sara I want to
meet with both of you

48:14.225 --> 48:17.428
in my office at the end
of the day tomorrow.

48:17.428 --> 48:18.596
- Oh, but I...

48:24.002 --> 48:27.939
- She just wants everything
to be nice, you know, for us.

48:27.939 --> 48:29.374
Her heart's in the right place.

48:29.374 --> 48:30.608
- You need to talk to her.

48:30.608 --> 48:32.177
- I know, I'll try.

48:33.344 --> 48:36.414
- You've been trying,
I need you to do it.

48:36.414 --> 48:40.651
- Okay, we have to get
past all this craziness

48:40.651 --> 48:43.488
so we can start
our life together.

48:44.622 --> 48:47.392
- This craziness
is important to me.

48:48.326 --> 48:49.560
- I know, I know.

48:49.560 --> 48:52.263
I'm just saying
I'm excited to get

48:52.263 --> 48:56.567
to the part that really
matters, you know?

48:56.567 --> 48:58.169
- This matters.

48:58.169 --> 48:59.170
Our wedding matters!

48:59.170 --> 49:01.072
- I know, I know
that it matters.

49:01.072 --> 49:04.409
- You standing up to
your mother matters!

49:04.409 --> 49:05.643
- I know.

49:05.643 --> 49:08.513
- You are marrying
me, not your mother!

49:11.149 --> 49:12.317
- Come on, Em.

49:13.484 --> 49:16.254
- Suddenly I've
lost my appetite.

49:17.855 --> 49:18.689
- Emily.

49:20.858 --> 49:22.093
- Did you forget something?

49:22.093 --> 49:23.328
- Nope.

49:23.328 --> 49:25.330
- Did Chris have to
run to his mommy?

49:25.330 --> 49:26.164
Emily, you--

49:26.164 --> 49:27.365
- Don't.

49:27.365 --> 49:30.101
What do you know
about relationships?

49:30.101 --> 49:31.869
Please, tell me.

49:31.869 --> 49:34.239
- Relationships
are negotiations.

49:34.239 --> 49:36.641
I know that you can't be
weak when negotiating.

49:36.641 --> 49:37.875
- Ashley, leave her alone.

49:37.875 --> 49:40.145
- You stay out of
it, Miss Piggy!

49:40.145 --> 49:41.346
- Excuse me?

49:41.346 --> 49:44.049
- Well can you clean
some of this up?

49:44.049 --> 49:47.385
- Alright, boss,
whatever you say!

49:47.385 --> 49:50.788
Gosh guys, everybody
just needs to relax!

50:07.505 --> 50:08.339
Morning.

50:13.578 --> 50:14.412

- Jeremy!

52:00.351 --> 52:01.752
- Hey girl!

52:01.752 --> 52:03.188
- What are you doin'?

52:03.188 --> 52:04.455
- Oh, I just had a few
minutes to grab some coffee

52:04.455 --> 52:07.192
before meeting up with a
client and ran into you.

52:07.192 --> 52:08.025
- Well, how have you been?

52:08.025 --> 52:10.127
- Oh, I am delightful.

52:10.127 --> 52:11.061
- Good.

52:11.061 --> 52:13.698
- How's uh, how's Ashley?

52:13.698 --> 52:15.132
- Ashley's good.

52:15.132 --> 52:16.401
Why don't you call her?

52:16.401 --> 52:19.437
- Yeah, that's a,
that's a dead end.

52:19.437 --> 52:20.405
- Can't hurt to try.

52:20.405 --> 52:21.239
- Yeah?

52:21.239 --> 52:22.473
- I don't know.

52:22.473 --> 52:24.709
- Well I ran into
Josh yesterday.

52:24.709 --> 52:25.543
- Really?

52:26.711 --> 52:27.545
Yesterday?

52:28.813 --> 52:30.848
- You didn't know he was back?

52:30.848 --> 52:33.951
- Um, No, I knew,
I knew he was back.

52:35.186 --> 52:36.654
I'm sure he told
you all about it..

52:36.654 --> 52:39.357
They had a great time, yeah.

52:39.357 --> 52:42.026
- You didn't know, did you?

52:42.026 --> 52:45.496
- No, I didn't, but
you know he's probably

52:45.496 --> 52:47.131
hanging out with his
family and stuff.

52:47.131 --> 52:48.633
It makes total
sense, it's whatever.

52:48.633 --> 52:50.601
But I'm sure we'll
talk, we'll talk soon.

52:50.601 --> 52:53.103
- Hey, he is an absolute idiot

52:54.539 --> 52:56.641
if he messes things up with you.

52:56.641 --> 52:57.475
- Thanks.

52:58.676 --> 52:59.810
- I gotta go.

52:59.810 --> 53:00.745
- Yeah.

53:00.745 --> 53:01.679
- It was really good to see you.

53:01.679 --> 53:03.248
- It was so good to see you.

53:03.248 --> 53:04.181
- And I'll see you
at the wedding.

53:04.181 --> 53:07.017
- Yeah, and call Ashley, okay?

53:07.017 --> 53:07.852
- Yeah.

53:10.255 --> 53:12.723
- I asked Ashley to handle
the conversion of the files

53:12.723 --> 53:15.192
from paper to digital, I
showed her how to do it,

53:15.192 --> 53:17.462
I explained that the board
of directors requires it,

53:17.462 --> 53:19.897
and she has fought me on
it every step of the way.

53:19.897 --> 53:22.099
- Why are the two of you
in my office about this?

53:22.099 --> 53:23.634
- Exactly.

53:23.634 --> 53:25.536
- Miss Brockman, I didn't
fight her on this at all.

53:25.536 --> 53:27.305
I've been working on
it for at least a month

53:27.305 --> 53:30.575
and nearly finished
all the files for 2005.

53:30.575 --> 53:33.210
I simply asked her if I
could work on something else

53:33.210 --> 53:34.879
at least part of the time.

53:34.879 --> 53:36.814
I explained that I have
more to offer this company

53:36.814 --> 53:39.784
than sitting and running
copies through a scanner.

53:39.784 --> 53:42.620
- I have things to do,
clients to keep happy.

53:42.620 --> 53:43.988
- I guess I just
came to you because

53:43.988 --> 53:46.591
I didn't get a
response from Diane.

53:46.591 --> 53:48.058
- She got a response from me.

53:48.058 --> 53:49.394
The job needs to be done.

53:49.394 --> 53:50.728
It wasn't the answer
she wanted to hear

53:50.728 --> 53:52.797
so she came to you
with a complaint.

53:52.797 --> 53:53.864
- It's not a complaint.

53:53.864 --> 53:55.266
- I stuck my neck out for you.

53:55.266 --> 53:56.967
I said let's hire the local girl

53:56.967 --> 53:58.936
because she'll connect
well with clients.

53:58.936 --> 53:59.770
- You were right!

53:59.770 --> 54:01.138
- I'm not so sure!

54:01.138 --> 54:03.040
- I'm not going to
spend my day babysitting

54:03.040 --> 54:05.042
somebody who refuses
to do the task

54:05.042 --> 54:06.277
that's been assigned to her

54:06.277 --> 54:07.812
because she wants to
do something else.

54:07.812 --> 54:10.080
This is the thing
we need you to do.

54:10.080 --> 54:11.916
Did I make a mistake
in hiring you?

54:11.916 --> 54:14.184
- I didn't go to
college for four years

54:14.184 --> 54:17.888
to be stuck in a
basement making copies.

54:17.888 --> 54:18.689
I quit.

54:19.724 --> 54:22.493
(dramatic music)

55:26.290 --> 55:28.726
(soft music)

55:36.300 --> 55:38.969
(keys clanking)

55:40.471 --> 55:42.139
- Oh no, no, no, no!

55:54.819 --> 55:57.087
(groaning)

56:10.134 --> 56:12.903
(phone thumping)

56:21.546 --> 56:22.980
Come on, come on.

56:25.816 --> 56:28.085
(mumbling)

56:39.697 --> 56:41.632
- [Josh] Jessica?

56:41.632 --> 56:42.933
- Oh, Josh!

56:42.933 --> 56:43.768
Josh, hi.

56:45.002 --> 56:46.170
I dropped my keys
inside your house,

56:46.170 --> 56:47.905
and then I was
trying to get my keys

56:47.905 --> 56:50.174
and I dropped my phone too.

56:53.377 --> 56:54.211
Who's she?

56:55.480 --> 56:57.982
- Jessica, this is Monica.

56:57.982 --> 57:00.485
- Monica, you're middle
school girlfriend?

57:00.485 --> 57:02.219
- I'm now his fiance.

57:05.322 --> 57:07.024
- I was gonna call you.
- Josh, get my keys.

57:07.024 --> 57:09.527
- Jessica.
- Get my keys, Josh!

57:23.508 --> 57:25.543
- [Monica] What's that?

57:25.543 --> 57:27.211

59:13.183 --> 59:17.121
All she wants is for us
to have a nice wedding.

59:19.023 --> 59:20.290
She's trying to help.

59:20.290 --> 59:22.827
Why can't we just
let her help, I--

59:22.827 --> 59:24.762
- So that's it, then?

59:24.762 --> 59:27.665
(melancholy music)

59:35.539 --> 59:37.341
I can't do this.

59:37.341 --> 59:40.444

second, wait a second.

59:40.444 --> 59:41.278
Emily, Em.

59:42.680 --> 59:43.513
Emily!

59:47.885 --> 59:49.687
- He's getting married!

59:49.687 --> 59:50.520
- Who's he gonna marry?

59:50.520 --> 59:51.355
- Not me!

59:53.023 --> 59:54.258
- Well, I quit.

59:55.392 --> 59:57.094
Don't wanna talk about
it, so don't ask.

59:57.094 --> 59:58.595
(agitated crosstalk)

59:58.595 --> 01:00:01.465
I can't stay in that place
and make copies anymore.

01:00:01.465 --> 01:00:02.566
What is this?

01:00:02.566 --> 01:00:03.668
- Josh is getting married!

01:00:03.668 --> 01:00:05.069
- And I'm not!
- What, to who?

01:00:05.069 --> 01:00:05.903
- Monica!

01:00:05.903 --> 01:00:06.904
- Who's Monica?

01:00:06.904 --> 01:00:08.472
- Are you listening?

01:00:08.472 --> 01:00:10.207
- Em, what happened?

01:00:10.207 --> 01:00:11.742
- Beverly!

01:00:11.742 --> 01:00:15.212
- Oh, if I hear that woman's
name one more time I swear!

01:00:15.212 --> 01:00:17.514
Why can't you just do
something about it?

01:00:17.514 --> 01:00:19.817
- Oh, cause that worked
out great for you!

01:00:19.817 --> 01:00:21.719
You just quit your dream job!

01:00:21.719 --> 01:00:23.654
- Well Jess told me to
go take her some nuts

01:00:23.654 --> 01:00:25.923
and I almost kill my supervisor.

01:00:25.923 --> 01:00:28.058
- Why would you listen to
me, I don't even have a job?

01:00:28.058 --> 01:00:29.459
- I can't come back from that.

01:00:29.459 --> 01:00:30.661
- It's not my fault!

01:00:30.661 --> 01:00:31.896
- You told her to do it.

01:00:31.896 --> 01:00:33.864
- And we told you
to stop whining

01:00:33.864 --> 01:00:36.100
and take control of
your life for once.

01:00:36.100 --> 01:00:37.802
- You stabbed me in the back!

01:00:37.802 --> 01:00:39.203
- Yeah, that was low, Jessica.

01:00:39.203 --> 01:00:41.371
- All these cakes are
beautiful, Beverly.

01:00:41.371 --> 01:00:43.007
I wanna have them at my wedding.

01:00:43.007 --> 01:00:44.374
- Oh, wait a minute,
it is not my fault

01:00:44.374 --> 01:00:46.576
that you are too weak
to control your man.

01:00:46.576 --> 01:00:49.880
- Oh, that is rich
coming from you.

01:00:49.880 --> 01:00:52.316
Your man just proposed
to somebody else.

01:00:52.316 --> 01:00:53.550
- You two are ridiculous.

01:00:53.550 --> 01:00:54.785
- Ever since you moved in--

01:00:54.785 --> 01:00:56.420
- Nothing has gone right.

01:00:56.420 --> 01:00:58.188
- This is not working!

01:00:58.188 --> 01:00:59.223
- Maybe it was a mistake!

01:00:59.223 --> 01:01:00.057
- Maybe I should leave!

01:01:00.057 --> 01:01:01.491
- Maybe you should!

01:01:01.491 --> 01:01:04.261
(dramatic music)

01:01:06.230 --> 01:01:08.899
(door thudding)

01:01:26.616 --> 01:01:29.553
(knocking on door)

01:01:34.058 --> 01:01:36.994
(knocking on door)

01:01:43.633 --> 01:01:44.468
- Gracie?

01:01:47.504 --> 01:01:48.338
Gracie?

01:01:51.008 --> 01:01:51.842
Gracie?

01:01:55.946 --> 01:01:56.781
Gracie?

01:02:01.752 --> 01:02:02.586
Gracie?

01:02:08.592 --> 01:02:09.426
Gracie?

01:02:20.670 --> 01:02:24.842
Hey, Tyler, do you
know where Gracie is?

01:02:24.842 --> 01:02:27.878
No, she's not at the house.

01:02:27.878 --> 01:02:30.881
Okay, do you know
where she might be?

01:02:30.881 --> 01:02:32.382
Okay, hey, I think I know.

01:02:32.382 --> 01:02:36.253
I have an idea, I think I
know where she might be.

01:02:40.190 --> 01:02:41.025
Okay.

01:02:42.559 --> 01:02:45.562
(suspenseful music)

01:02:55.372 --> 01:02:57.407
Hey, Tyler, I thought
I knew where she was

01:02:57.407 --> 01:02:58.575
but she's not here
and I can't find her--

01:02:58.575 --> 01:03:00.210
- [Gracie] Richard, Richard!

01:03:00.210 --> 01:03:01.445
- I found her.

01:03:01.445 --> 01:03:02.546
- [Gracie] Richard,
where are you!

01:03:02.546 --> 01:03:03.480
- Gracie.

01:03:03.480 --> 01:03:04.781
- Tyler and I are waiting.

01:03:04.781 --> 01:03:05.615
We're ready to go to
the fair, Richard.

01:03:05.615 --> 01:03:07.684
- Gracie, Gracie.

01:03:07.684 --> 01:03:08.518
- Richard, ow!

01:03:08.518 --> 01:03:09.353
- Hey.

01:03:09.353 --> 01:03:11.221
- Oh, you frightened me.

01:03:11.221 --> 01:03:12.456
- Sorry, hey Gracie--

01:03:12.456 --> 01:03:13.523
- I'm waiting for
my husband, Richard.

01:03:13.523 --> 01:03:14.724
He's in here.

01:03:14.724 --> 01:03:15.792
Richard!
- Gracie.

01:03:15.792 --> 01:03:16.861
Gracie, I'm gonna take you home.

01:03:16.861 --> 01:03:17.694
Come on.
- Richard!

01:03:17.694 --> 01:03:18.963
Where are you, Richard?

01:03:18.963 --> 01:03:20.230
- Tyler's waiting
for you, your son.

01:03:20.230 --> 01:03:22.132
- Tyler, he's waiting?
- Yeah, he's at home.

01:03:22.132 --> 01:03:23.433
- Is Richard with him?

01:03:23.433 --> 01:03:24.601
- Let's go home.

01:03:24.601 --> 01:03:25.402
I'll take you home.
- No, Richard,

01:03:25.402 --> 01:03:26.670
Richard is in here.

01:03:26.670 --> 01:03:28.338
Richard, he's my husband!

01:03:28.338 --> 01:03:29.373
- It's Jessica,
please come with me.

01:03:29.373 --> 01:03:30.207
- No.

01:03:30.207 --> 01:03:31.441
Richard.

01:03:31.441 --> 01:03:32.509
- Gracie, I need you
to come with me, come.

01:03:32.509 --> 01:03:34.078
- Richard.
- I'll take you home.

01:03:34.078 --> 01:03:35.880
I've got you, let's go.

01:03:35.880 --> 01:03:37.614
- Gonna take me
to see my Richard?

01:03:37.614 --> 01:03:38.648
- I'm gonna take you home.

01:03:38.648 --> 01:03:39.984
Tyler, Tyler's home, your son.

01:03:39.984 --> 01:03:40.817
- Tyler?

01:03:40.817 --> 01:03:41.651
- Yeah.

01:03:41.651 --> 01:03:43.020
- Is Richard with Tyler?

01:03:43.020 --> 01:03:44.821
I've got to get my
husband Richard,

01:03:44.821 --> 01:03:47.591
he's gonna take Tyler and...

01:03:47.591 --> 01:03:48.825
Do you know who Tyler is?

01:03:48.825 --> 01:03:50.660
- Yes, he's your
son, he's at home.

01:03:50.660 --> 01:03:52.029
- Richard!

01:03:52.029 --> 01:03:53.363

- My sweet, beautiful daughter.

01:09:00.604 --> 01:09:03.340
As I'm watching you
sleep, I'm reminded

01:09:03.340 --> 01:09:07.577
of all the beautiful
moments we've had together.

01:09:07.577 --> 01:09:09.912
Inside this box
there's a few things

01:09:09.912 --> 01:09:14.017
I hope will help you to
understand how much I love you,

01:09:14.017 --> 01:09:16.486
and how sorry that I
am that I will miss

01:09:16.486 --> 01:09:18.988
so many more moments with you.

01:09:20.823 --> 01:09:23.026
I've left you all my journals.

01:09:23.026 --> 01:09:24.728
Don't let your dad read 'em.

01:09:24.728 --> 01:09:26.630
His ego is too fragile.

01:09:29.433 --> 01:09:31.568
I also made a DVD for you.

01:09:31.568 --> 01:09:35.772
I figured it out by
myself, can you believe it?

01:09:35.772 --> 01:09:37.106
I love you, Mom.

01:09:39.309 --> 01:09:42.078
(peaceful music)

01:11:00.490 --> 01:11:01.291
Okay.

01:11:03.393 --> 01:11:04.394
There we go.

01:11:08.865 --> 01:11:12.536
I am so proud of you
and I love you so much.

01:11:14.371 --> 01:11:17.474
You're my joy and my happiness,

01:11:17.474 --> 01:11:21.177
and you're the best
part of me and your dad.

01:11:21.177 --> 01:11:24.614
I wish that I could see you grow

01:11:24.614 --> 01:11:29.619
into the beautiful woman
that I know you are today.

01:11:29.619 --> 01:11:32.556
But I am so thankful to God

01:11:32.556 --> 01:11:36.225
that I was able to spend
this time with you.

01:11:38.728 --> 01:11:42.198
I want to share
some things that God

01:11:42.198 --> 01:11:44.934
has taught me
through my illness.

01:11:50.306 --> 01:11:51.875
Faith.

01:11:51.875 --> 01:11:55.945
faith in God, faith in
people, faith in yourself.

01:11:57.714 --> 01:11:59.248
Life can really wear on you

01:11:59.248 --> 01:12:02.552
and make you
question your faith.

01:12:02.552 --> 01:12:04.954
There's gonna be
things in this life

01:12:04.954 --> 01:12:07.457
that you have no control over,

01:12:09.258 --> 01:12:12.529
and there's gonna be times that
you feel like you're alone,

01:12:12.529 --> 01:12:16.366
like God has abandoned
you, but He never will.

01:12:17.767 --> 01:12:22.005
Sometimes He is so close
that we just can't see Him.

01:12:25.575 --> 01:12:26.410
Love.

01:12:27.577 --> 01:12:31.748
Love God, love people,
and love the person

01:12:31.748 --> 01:12:34.484
that God created you to be.

01:12:34.484 --> 01:12:37.721
You have to love with
reckless abandon.

01:12:38.888 --> 01:12:43.292
Work hard on being the
best version of yourself

01:12:43.292 --> 01:12:47.797
so then someday God's gonna
send somebody to love you,

01:12:49.265 --> 01:12:51.768
somebody to build a life with,

01:12:52.969 --> 01:12:55.805
and someone you can
be yourself with,

01:12:55.805 --> 01:12:59.208
and that's how you
know it's love.

01:12:59.208 --> 01:13:01.077
And finally, chocolate.

01:13:03.312 --> 01:13:06.015
It's good for the soul.

01:13:06.015 --> 01:13:07.951
It's good for the hurt.

01:13:07.951 --> 01:13:10.554
It's good for the pain.

01:13:10.554 --> 01:13:13.557
And sometimes, it's
just plain good.

01:13:14.991 --> 01:13:19.529
To live a life full of what
God has in store for you,

01:13:20.263 --> 01:13:21.364
find the chocolate.

01:13:24.300 --> 01:13:25.569
And I love you.

01:13:37.647 --> 01:13:39.415
- Find the chocolate.

01:13:57.801 --> 01:13:58.768
- Jessica?

01:13:58.768 --> 01:14:01.237
- I know what she's looking for!

01:14:23.459 --> 01:14:27.296
- Sweetheart, what
are you doing here?

01:14:27.296 --> 01:14:30.333
- Uh, I came over
last night, Mama.

01:14:30.333 --> 01:14:32.869
- Well is everything okay?

01:14:32.869 --> 01:14:33.703
Jessica?

01:14:39.375 --> 01:14:41.611
Oh, did I, did I--

01:14:41.611 --> 01:14:42.946
- You did, Mama.

01:14:44.380 --> 01:14:45.882
Jessica found you.

01:14:51.087 --> 01:14:53.823
- Chocolate is
good for the soul.

01:14:54.991 --> 01:14:58.027
Is this what you've
been looking for?

01:14:59.696 --> 01:15:00.496
- Oh!

01:15:04.834 --> 01:15:06.169
A kiss for Mama.

01:15:09.806 --> 01:15:12.141
- I forgot about that thing.

01:15:13.509 --> 01:15:17.346
My friends, they still
laugh at me because of that.

01:15:17.346 --> 01:15:19.616
- And your daddy would say?

01:15:21.050 --> 01:15:25.088
- If they laugh at you, you
look them straight in the eye

01:15:25.088 --> 01:15:28.257
and you say, don't
you love your mama?

01:15:30.560 --> 01:15:32.796
- Don't you love your mama?

01:15:40.737 --> 01:15:42.906
Memories that God gives us

01:15:45.274 --> 01:15:48.111
are our most
precious possessions.

01:15:52.616 --> 01:15:53.449
Thank you.

01:15:56.352 --> 01:15:57.186
Oh.

01:15:58.121 --> 01:16:00.189
(crying)

01:16:17.273 --> 01:16:19.843
No matter, I will never forget.

01:16:22.178 --> 01:16:24.180
I will never forget you.

01:16:25.181 --> 01:16:26.650
I love you.

01:16:26.650 --> 01:16:28.251
- [Jessica Voiceover]
Somebody once said

01:16:28.251 --> 01:16:31.220
one joy can scatter
a hundred griefs.

01:16:31.220 --> 01:16:35.458
I think that's what my mom
wanted me to understand.

01:16:41.631 --> 01:16:42.832
- There you are!

01:16:42.832 --> 01:16:44.367
We've been out looking
for you all night.

01:16:44.367 --> 01:16:46.035
- We called the
hospitals, the police,

01:16:46.035 --> 01:16:47.837
the fire department, everyone.

01:16:47.837 --> 01:16:48.838
- I'm sorry.

01:16:51.107 --> 01:16:52.809
- You opened the box?

01:16:52.809 --> 01:16:54.644
- Are you okay?

01:16:54.644 --> 01:16:56.145
- Yes, it's great.

01:16:57.881 --> 01:16:59.415
- We're sorry about last night.

01:16:59.415 --> 01:17:00.950
- You have to stay.

01:17:03.687 --> 01:17:06.656
- I'm sorry too,
I don't wanna go.

01:17:06.656 --> 01:17:08.758
- Good, cause you're
not going anywhere.

01:17:08.758 --> 01:17:10.994
(laughing)

into anything new,

whether it's high school,
college, or the real world.

01:19:30.066 --> 01:19:32.301
No matter how much
you prepare yourself,

01:19:32.301 --> 01:19:35.038
so many things happen that
are out of your control.

01:19:35.038 --> 01:19:38.774
It's easy to become paralyzed
with fear of the unknown,

01:19:38.774 --> 01:19:40.609
it's easy to get lost.

01:19:41.945 --> 01:19:45.114
Fear and faith are two
sides of the same coin,

01:19:45.114 --> 01:19:47.450
whichever one you
focus on is the one

01:19:47.450 --> 01:19:50.186
that will dominate your life.

01:19:50.186 --> 01:19:52.922
So walk with your
eyes wide open.

01:19:54.123 --> 01:19:58.361
Walk in faith and be who
God created you to be.
