-Catchin' up on some porn, huh?
-Uh, that's right, boss.

00:32.115 --> 00:33.825
Just porning it up
at the office.

00:33.908 --> 00:35.285
Well, if you need
to finish, you know,

00:35.368 --> 00:37.537
flickin' it, or, uh,
whatever you're
doin' down there,

00:37.620 --> 00:38.955
you know, just
slappin' your flaps,

00:39.038 --> 00:41.708
-I can duck out.
Just let me know.
-Oh god, stop.

00:41.791 --> 00:44.002
I was actually
just watching
a dumb music video

00:44.085 --> 00:46.671
my brother made
for the anniversary
of our dad's death.

00:46.755 --> 00:49.466
Your dad would be so
proud of you, Candy.

00:49.549 --> 00:51.092
Acting number two
at Santa Inc.,

00:51.176 --> 00:52.135
you're a guest
of Santa at his

00:52.218 --> 00:53.470
South Pole Villa
this weekend,

00:53.553 --> 00:55.722
-you're a very snappy dresser--
-Back it up, back it up

00:55.805 --> 00:57.682
to the South Pole Villa part.

00:57.766 --> 00:59.476
Oh, I want you to come there
with me and the Board.

00:59.559 --> 01:01.686
I'm doin' trips
with all the top
Successor contenders.

01:01.770 --> 01:04.939
We did a wine tasting last
weekend with Timmy the Toy Guy.

01:05.023 --> 01:06.649
What can I say?
He was a fun hang.

01:06.733 --> 01:08.234
He's pullin' toys out
all the fuckin' time.

01:08.318 --> 01:10.737
-It's just inherently fun.
-Oh, I'm so happy for Timmy,

01:10.820 --> 01:13.072
the totally uninteresting
white male choice

01:13.156 --> 01:14.657
that will do nothing
for this company.

01:14.741 --> 01:16.284
You know what it could be,
is a good chance

01:16.367 --> 01:17.660
for you to wipe away
the memory of your

01:17.744 --> 01:19.162
State of the Workshop
hell speech.

01:19.245 --> 01:20.997
I mean, "hell speech"
is probably too harsh.

01:21.080 --> 01:23.500
Uh, "Nightmare speech"?
"Apocalypse speech"?

01:23.583 --> 01:25.001
You know,
all those sound worse.

01:25.084 --> 01:27.128
-Are ya in?
-Fuck yes! Wow.

01:27.212 --> 01:28.755
Be a fun hang,
like Timmy.

01:28.838 --> 01:31.591
You know, be yourself,
but the most Timmy

01:31.674 --> 01:32.801
version of yourself.

01:32.884 --> 01:35.220
I assumed you knew
I was infamously

01:35.303 --> 01:37.555
one of the most fun
people who's ever existed.

01:37.639 --> 01:39.682
Mm-hm, yeah, sure.
If you say so.

01:39.766 --> 01:41.518
Even penguins
think I'm funny.

01:41.601 --> 01:43.061
And you know
what a tough crowd

01:43.144 --> 01:45.271
those miserable
motherfuckers are.

01:45.355 --> 01:47.899
(joyful music playing)

01:52.070 --> 01:53.321
(horn honks)

01:57.826 --> 01:59.828
-Candy: I'm fun, right?
-Goldie: Of course.

01:59.911 --> 02:02.580
Why would I, a woman,
whose motto is,

02:02.664 --> 02:04.123
"I live for dick,"

02:04.207 --> 02:05.542
have a best friend who sucked?

02:05.625 --> 02:07.961
Your impressions make
everyone so happy.

02:08.044 --> 02:09.462
Remember in high school
when you crank called

02:09.546 --> 02:11.548
your mother
and pretended
to be Tom Selleck?

02:11.631 --> 02:15.176
"I would love to devour
your hot bod, Mrs. Smalls."

02:15.260 --> 02:18.721
"Let Magnum whisk
you away to Hawaii."

02:18.805 --> 02:21.057
You guys are right.
I rule.

02:21.140 --> 02:23.059
I just hope that
Santa and the Board

02:23.143 --> 02:24.602
see in me what you see.

02:24.686 --> 02:26.062
Would you guys wanna come?

02:26.145 --> 02:27.856
Santa said I could bring guests.

02:27.939 --> 02:31.150
-South Pole, here we come!
-(all cheering)

02:31.234 --> 02:32.360
What the fuck,
Cookie?

02:32.443 --> 02:34.571
I have to babysit
while you go
on vacation?

02:34.654 --> 02:38.241
You don't babysit
your own child, asshole!

02:38.324 --> 02:39.617
And if you
deny me this,

02:39.701 --> 02:42.161
the next time
your body will be
touched by my hands

02:42.245 --> 02:43.788
is when I shove
you down the stairs

02:43.872 --> 02:45.748
-to get your life insurance.
-Take all the time ya need.

02:45.832 --> 02:48.418
I'll be here,
babysitting, ehh,
with the kid, eh,

02:48.501 --> 02:49.961
come back when y--
Bye voyage.

02:50.044 --> 02:51.963
Devin:
Let's go over what we know:

02:52.046 --> 02:55.592
Santa and the Board are
all male and all white.

02:55.675 --> 03:00.054
Their average age is 67
because they're all 67.

03:00.138 --> 03:02.807
They play golf,
drink, smoke cigars,

03:02.891 --> 03:05.602
say things like, "deregulation,"

03:05.685 --> 03:07.520
and "quarterly earnings,"

03:07.604 --> 03:09.689
and "don't ever
marry your mistress."

03:09.772 --> 03:10.899
Oh, I know how to play golf.

03:10.982 --> 03:12.775
I, I played with
my dad all the time.

03:12.859 --> 03:14.319
I'm actually pretty good.

03:14.402 --> 03:17.405
What I need to learn is how
to bro out with these guys.

03:17.488 --> 03:19.324
You know,
shoot the shit,
do shots,

03:19.407 --> 03:21.075
shoot shots of shit, whatever.

03:21.159 --> 03:22.744
Oh, you've come
to the right guy.

03:22.827 --> 03:25.455
The Board are exactly
like my frat bros,

03:25.538 --> 03:28.291
except they pop Viagra
instead of Adderall.

03:28.374 --> 03:30.418
Now we have 48 hours
of cramming to do.

03:30.501 --> 03:32.253
Let's go over that
dirty joke again.

03:32.337 --> 03:35.590
A cucumber, a pickle,
and a penis sit at a bar.

03:35.673 --> 03:38.301
(motivational music playing)

03:47.101 --> 03:49.979
♪ ♪

03:57.028 --> 03:58.321
(razor buzzing)

04:01.240 --> 04:03.493
Look at me.

04:03.576 --> 04:06.079
I look hot enough
to melt the polar ice caps.

04:06.162 --> 04:08.456
Billions would perish,
but I don't care

04:08.539 --> 04:12.085
'cause I look great
in a bathing suit.

04:12.168 --> 04:15.922
What's wrong?
You love it when I pretend
I'm not an old bag of shit.

04:16.005 --> 04:18.424
I am feeling
a little down lately.

04:18.508 --> 04:20.510
This morning,
I put an English muffin
in our toaster,

04:20.593 --> 04:22.387
and I just stared
at the toaster until

04:22.470 --> 04:23.846
the English muffin...

04:23.930 --> 04:25.682
popped back up.

04:25.765 --> 04:27.809
Have you ever done that?
Just stared.

04:27.892 --> 04:29.769
Is it gonna do what
it always does?

04:29.852 --> 04:31.854
And then, it does.

04:31.938 --> 04:33.147
I guess it's a relief.

04:33.231 --> 04:35.358
You're the most
beautiful Mrs. Claus

04:35.441 --> 04:36.693
since the beginning of time.

04:36.776 --> 04:39.070
This vacation is
going to be great.

04:39.153 --> 04:41.614
All I want is
to see if Candy
can hold her own,

04:41.698 --> 04:44.033
and to fuck my lady
in our new jacuzzi

04:44.117 --> 04:45.201
with the underwater TVs.

04:45.284 --> 04:48.496
(sighs)
I wonder what
the toaster's up to.

04:48.579 --> 04:50.081
Candy:
Gone for the weekend, suckers.

04:50.164 --> 04:51.708
Don't miss me too much,
and don't--

04:51.791 --> 04:53.835
Oh, would you look
at this, Candy.

04:53.918 --> 04:55.336
Isn't it beautiful?

04:55.420 --> 04:57.630
My retirement plan.

04:57.714 --> 05:00.133
A betting pool to decide
the future Successor.

05:00.216 --> 05:03.261
Ha, ha, yes.
Grandpa is a genius.

05:03.344 --> 05:05.888
We Smalls are
gonna make it rain
in this bitch!

05:05.972 --> 05:07.098
This is very illegal.

05:07.181 --> 05:08.725
You could go
to jail for this.

05:08.808 --> 05:10.893
What?
At least I'd get three hots

05:10.977 --> 05:12.270
and a cot in the clink.

05:12.353 --> 05:14.522
My miner's pension is
a hundred bucks a month

05:14.605 --> 05:15.982
and a sock full of coal.

05:16.065 --> 05:17.942
Oh my god,
that is so bad.

05:18.026 --> 05:20.528
But when I'm Successor,
I can change things.

05:20.611 --> 05:22.989
Okay, let's see
how I'm doing.

05:23.072 --> 05:25.825
The bottom?! This is fucked!

05:25.908 --> 05:28.077
I'm better than
Male Human Shit!

05:28.161 --> 05:29.996
You'll see!
You'll all see!

05:30.997 --> 05:34.000
(ship horn blows)

05:34.083 --> 05:36.878
Holy motherfuckin' ship.

05:36.961 --> 05:38.880
Yep, Santa's private yacht.

05:38.963 --> 05:40.256
The "Twelve Twenty-Six."

05:40.339 --> 05:43.551
Built a hundred years ago
entirely by Elf labor.

05:43.634 --> 05:46.596
Get ready to set sail on
my Great-Grandpa's sweat.

05:46.679 --> 05:47.805
This is so fun!

05:47.889 --> 05:49.932
I "forgot"
my wedding ring
at home,

05:50.016 --> 05:52.560
so, technically, I am
back on the market!

05:52.643 --> 05:56.022
Cruisin' into some D!
Ding-Ding! Dicks ahoy!

05:56.105 --> 05:58.274
Hey!
I wanted to
wish you luck.

05:58.357 --> 06:01.903
Good tidings,
Mademoiselle Goldie.

06:01.986 --> 06:05.281
Uh, would you do me
the honor of going on

06:05.364 --> 06:07.950
a petite date with me
when you're back

06:08.034 --> 06:09.368
from this
little journey?

06:09.452 --> 06:12.455
I'm not looking
for any more rando
hook-ups, okay?

06:12.538 --> 06:14.832
I need a real adult
with a career.

06:14.916 --> 06:17.960
Not some college
slob with a boner
in his cargo shorts.

06:18.044 --> 06:19.420
Ah, I'm sorry.

06:19.504 --> 06:21.130
Captain:
Get ready for an adventure

06:21.214 --> 06:23.382
unlike anything
ya ever experienced.

06:23.466 --> 06:27.053
Unless ya done
Molly and Oxy together,
which I just did.

06:27.136 --> 06:30.056
And I should not be operating
heavy machinery right now,

06:30.139 --> 06:31.474
but fuck it!

06:31.557 --> 06:33.226
All aboard!

06:33.309 --> 06:35.937
(drill whirring)

06:40.983 --> 06:42.568
-Candy: What?
-Cookie/Goldie: Huh?

06:44.779 --> 06:46.489
All:
Ooh! Wow!

06:51.244 --> 06:53.496
Candy:
Men of the Board,
after that wild ride,

06:53.579 --> 06:56.582
let me give you a little sorbet
to cleanse the palate.

06:56.666 --> 07:00.628
My personal, very own
impression of Santa.

07:00.711 --> 07:04.006
"Did I tell you I chose
the first Black Successor?

07:04.090 --> 07:07.260
If you forget,
I'll remind you until you die."

07:07.343 --> 07:09.804
-(all laughing)
-You sound exactly like him.

07:09.887 --> 07:14.725
(beat music plays)

07:14.809 --> 07:16.936
-What's he doin' here?
-What the fuck? Is he crashing?

07:17.019 --> 07:17.895
He's crashing.

07:17.979 --> 07:19.188
I'm here not to vacation,

07:19.272 --> 07:21.149
but to recover from surgery.

07:21.232 --> 07:24.152
(grunts)
I gave my Grandma
half of my liver.

07:24.235 --> 07:27.196
It was very painful,
but ah, ah...

07:27.280 --> 07:28.030
it was worth it.

07:28.114 --> 07:30.241
So giving,
or dare I say,

07:30.324 --> 07:31.742
Me-esque.

07:31.826 --> 07:33.077
Come stay with us
for the weekend.

07:33.161 --> 07:36.539
No more talking!
I insist. You're coming.

07:36.622 --> 07:38.708
Why are you crashing?
You get your own event.

07:38.791 --> 07:41.627
I'm workin' my way up
the list of contenders,
bottom to top.

07:41.711 --> 07:43.129
Bang, bang, bang.

07:43.212 --> 07:45.256
And you're first,
so prepare for Hell,

07:45.339 --> 07:46.716
'cause I'm
startin' Smalls.

07:46.799 --> 07:49.135
Pun intended.

07:49.218 --> 07:51.387
Goldie:
I'm gonna marry
this fucking waffle

07:51.470 --> 07:52.930
whether it's legal
or not because

07:53.014 --> 07:55.266
(sings)
♪ Our love is real ♪

07:55.349 --> 07:58.186
I slept through all
the dumb-ass texts
Craig sent me.

07:58.269 --> 07:59.228
"I don't see the milk.

07:59.312 --> 08:00.980
"I'm lying in bed
with my eyes closed,

08:01.063 --> 08:02.356
"but I still
don't see the milk.

08:02.440 --> 08:03.649
"Good news!
Opened my eyes,

08:03.733 --> 08:05.568
"went into the kitchen
and opened the fridge.

08:05.651 --> 08:06.903
There was the milk."

08:06.986 --> 08:08.738
-Hey!
-Cookie: You look
like the bride

08:08.821 --> 08:10.239
at a lesbian
Leprechaun wedding.

08:10.323 --> 08:12.533
This is what these old guys
wear on the golf course.

08:12.617 --> 08:13.910
I need to fit in.

08:13.993 --> 08:15.494
If they're gonna
swing their dicks,

08:15.578 --> 08:16.913
I have to swing my vag.

08:16.996 --> 08:20.249
Leave Candy alone.
She's got that freak
Junior on her ass.

08:20.333 --> 08:22.335
I'm gonna bro these
guys' brains out,

08:22.418 --> 08:23.920
I'm gonna golf
their cocks off,

08:24.003 --> 08:26.380
then we'll all get wasted
at the steakhouse tonight

08:26.464 --> 08:28.257
where I'm ordering
the Japanese beef,

08:28.341 --> 08:30.635
and then, you know
what I'm gonna do?
I'm sendin' it back

08:30.718 --> 08:32.595
for being overdone,
even if it isn't,

08:32.678 --> 08:36.224
because that is what
a future Successor does.

08:36.307 --> 08:37.516
Peace!

08:37.600 --> 08:40.102
Isn't it weird
havin' a girl
on a guys' trip?

08:40.186 --> 08:44.398
Not bad weird.
Just like,
bad not as good.

08:44.482 --> 08:49.153
Is it "bad" that
I feel like slamming
this entire BM right now?

08:49.237 --> 08:51.113
Look at her toss that
celery to the side!

08:51.197 --> 08:52.448
She's not eatin'
that shit!

08:52.531 --> 08:54.951
She's one of the boys!
She knows it's garnish!

08:55.034 --> 08:58.204
Technically, the penis
and the clitoris develop
from the same organ,

08:58.287 --> 08:59.956
so I guess I am
one of the boys.

09:00.039 --> 09:02.625
Or maybe you're all one
of the girls! Heyo!

09:02.708 --> 09:03.918
(laughing)

09:04.001 --> 09:04.961
Good one,
Candy.

09:05.044 --> 09:07.171
Who cares?
I gotta drain the hog.

09:07.255 --> 09:10.132
-I hear that shit.
-Dick full of piss
ready to blow, huh?

09:10.216 --> 09:11.300
Candy:
Same, my bros.

09:11.384 --> 09:13.719
Vag full of piss,
ready to blow.

09:13.803 --> 09:17.265
Is there a, um, is there
a r-restroom nearby?

09:21.143 --> 09:22.478
Ah, I can hold it!

09:22.562 --> 09:24.647
Candy, don't be silly.
Find a restroom.

09:24.730 --> 09:27.441
-It's important. It's pee.
-Candy, let the number one

09:27.525 --> 09:29.110
reindeer help you
take a number one.

09:29.193 --> 09:31.946
-(horn honks)
-My caddy can drive you.

09:32.029 --> 09:35.574
Oh, okay, but my Katrina,
she is such a sweetheart.

09:35.658 --> 09:38.828
She asked me,
"Grandma, why can't every
day be Grandma Day?"

09:38.911 --> 09:42.540
-Now is that some real
cutie-pie shit or what?
-(all laughing)

09:42.623 --> 09:46.002
(awkward laughs)
Uh, so cute, yes.

09:46.085 --> 09:49.171
If I ever get that boring,
smother me in my sleep.

09:49.255 --> 09:51.215
But make sure to tweeze
my facial hair after

09:51.299 --> 09:52.675
in case I have an open coffin.

09:52.758 --> 09:56.137
We should save Mrs. Claus
from her boring-ass friends.

09:56.220 --> 09:57.805
Ladies, sorry
to interrupt.

09:57.888 --> 09:59.348
The concierge
inside has a package

09:59.432 --> 10:00.683
from the North Pole,
and they don't know

10:00.766 --> 10:02.351
who it's for.
It's just addressed to

10:02.435 --> 10:03.477
"The World's
Greatest Grandma."

10:03.561 --> 10:04.895
Move it or lose it,
Carol!

10:04.979 --> 10:06.022
I will cut you!

10:06.105 --> 10:08.024
I swear, I'll murder
your grandchild!

10:08.107 --> 10:09.358
Ow!

10:09.442 --> 10:11.527
I wonder who
the package was for?

10:11.610 --> 10:13.362
There was no package.
We just freed you

10:13.446 --> 10:14.822
from the boring
nightmare women.

10:14.905 --> 10:15.990
What? Those...

10:16.073 --> 10:18.159
annoying nightmares

10:18.242 --> 10:19.535
are my closest
friends.

10:19.618 --> 10:20.911
Nobody said
"annoying."

10:20.995 --> 10:21.912
That was all you.

10:21.996 --> 10:23.331
You're better
than them.

10:23.414 --> 10:26.334
Let's go do
something fancy!

10:26.417 --> 10:29.211
Whew, all peed out
and ready to rock.
Let's go!

10:29.295 --> 10:32.631
-Whoops, wrong hole.
-Is that what you
tell your wife?

10:32.715 --> 10:35.676
No, ma'am.
I tell her my truth,

10:35.760 --> 10:38.304
which is that
anal rocks.

10:41.140 --> 10:43.934
Cookie:
Mmm, oh my god, this is good.

10:44.018 --> 10:46.228
The best kneading
I've had in years.

10:46.312 --> 10:49.649
Mrs. Claus, you have
a knot the size of
a Christmas ornament!

10:49.732 --> 10:51.233
What do you have
to be stressed about?

10:51.317 --> 10:52.234
You're living the dream.

10:52.318 --> 10:54.111
My life is kinda boring.

10:54.195 --> 10:58.240
Schmoozing with dignitaries,
bullshitting with diplomats.

10:58.324 --> 11:00.242
I guess I thought Nick
and I would be partners,

11:00.326 --> 11:02.411
you know, change
Christmas for the better.

11:02.495 --> 11:04.080
-Like Candy.
-Mrs. Claus: Exactly!

11:04.163 --> 11:06.957
When I saw her speak
at the State of the Workshop,

11:07.041 --> 11:08.751
it all clicked.

11:08.834 --> 11:11.253
That's who I thought
I would be some day,

11:11.337 --> 11:15.091
an agent of change,
but I'm just a wife.

11:15.174 --> 11:17.009
-(laughs)
-Goldie: I get it.

11:17.093 --> 11:18.803
I train like a dog every year,

11:18.886 --> 11:21.222
and get treated like
a bitch on Christmas Eve.

11:21.305 --> 11:22.431
It truly sucks shit.

11:22.515 --> 11:26.268
Mmm, the tension
of dreams unrealized.

11:26.352 --> 11:29.730
There is nothing like it.

11:29.814 --> 11:32.858
We were here an hour ago!
You drove in a giant circle!

11:32.942 --> 11:35.319
Welp, I guess
we're lost.

11:35.403 --> 11:39.115
Let's just stay
in one place until
someone finds us.

11:39.198 --> 11:41.951
-Fan of historical fiction?
-Are you fuckin' kidding me?

11:42.034 --> 11:43.744
Shove over.
I'm driving.

11:45.121 --> 11:48.916
-(all laughing)
-Candy: Ah... sorry.

11:48.999 --> 11:51.127
Got a little
turned around
at the 18th hole.

11:51.210 --> 11:52.503
All:
Hole!

11:52.586 --> 11:54.171
Okay, what am I missing?

11:54.255 --> 11:55.798
Oh, nothing, just
the inside joke

11:55.881 --> 11:58.467
that will bond us guys,
and not you, forever.

11:58.551 --> 12:01.345
It's a really
funny, smart game
Junior made up.

12:01.429 --> 12:02.805
We tweak each
other's balls

12:02.888 --> 12:04.765
whenever someone
says "hole." Oh--

12:04.849 --> 12:05.724
-Hole!
-Oh, I did it!

12:05.808 --> 12:06.809
-Tweak, tweak, tweak.
-Hole!

12:06.892 --> 12:08.978
-(laughing)
-That's another.

12:09.061 --> 12:12.273
All:
Hole!

12:12.356 --> 12:16.819
-Whoa!
-Dear Lord, I keep forgetting
that you're not a small boy!

12:16.902 --> 12:19.447
-(all laughing)
-(Candy groans)

12:19.530 --> 12:21.407
Candy:
Hello, friends.
My day sucked.

12:21.490 --> 12:22.908
Junior won't
get off my dick,

12:22.992 --> 12:25.286
and everyone
loves him so much.

12:25.369 --> 12:27.830
He'll fuck up soon enough.
Ooh, call Junior a...

12:27.913 --> 12:29.165
(whispers):
caribou.

12:29.248 --> 12:30.499
Reindeer freak out at that.

12:30.583 --> 12:33.586
No, I still have Devin's
joke in my back pocket.

12:33.669 --> 12:35.629
And I picked up
these to be safe.

12:35.713 --> 12:38.340
The unholy alliance between
vaginas and bathrooms

12:38.424 --> 12:41.343
shall shackle women's
progress no longer!

12:41.427 --> 12:42.553
When do we
leave for dinner?

12:42.636 --> 12:44.013
I need time
to iron my tail.

12:44.096 --> 12:45.306
Yeah, there's some bad news.

12:45.389 --> 12:47.558
The dinner tonight is bros only.

12:47.641 --> 12:49.685
Well, bros and one ho, me.

12:49.768 --> 12:51.979
Going along with
this sexist tradition?

12:52.062 --> 12:53.063
It's against who you are.

12:53.147 --> 12:55.065
I fucking have to!
Don't you get it?

12:55.149 --> 12:57.526
Candy! You just
snapped at me.

12:57.610 --> 12:58.527
This is important!

12:58.611 --> 13:00.571
And you snap
at me all the time!

13:00.654 --> 13:02.490
Because years ago
we all agreed that

13:02.573 --> 13:05.242
I can dish it out,
but I can't take it.

13:05.326 --> 13:07.703
Why is she not
honoring my hypocrisy?

13:07.786 --> 13:08.954
I wish we could talk more,

13:09.038 --> 13:10.581
but I need to
throw on my diaper,

13:10.664 --> 13:12.541
and memorize
a grotesque sexist joke,

13:12.625 --> 13:15.294
so I can save the world
for women everywhere!

13:16.462 --> 13:19.215
I have to confess,
this whole trip,

13:19.298 --> 13:21.217
it's making me...

13:21.300 --> 13:24.011
-miss Craig.
-That's gross and dark.

13:24.094 --> 13:25.930
You're not even
the one who got
snapped at.

13:26.013 --> 13:27.932
But it triggered me
all the same.

13:28.015 --> 13:31.477
When Candy snapped,
it reminded me of when
I snap at Craig.

13:31.560 --> 13:33.646
He never snaps back.
He just grumbles,

13:33.729 --> 13:36.232
"crazy fuckin' bitch,"
and walks away.

13:36.315 --> 13:39.527
It's so sweet!
(sighs)

13:39.610 --> 13:42.112
I wonder what
he and Fun Size
are doing right now?

13:42.196 --> 13:43.822
That was a fun day
in the sandbox.

13:43.906 --> 13:47.034
Now, does Fun Size
wanna hear Daddy tell
a story before bed?

13:47.117 --> 13:51.789
This was not the playdate
I was looking for, asshole.

13:51.872 --> 13:54.542
Where the fuck is my baby?
Oh, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck!

13:56.502 --> 13:59.713
-Hey, massage buds!
-Mrs. Claus!

13:59.797 --> 14:02.925
-You goin' out on the town?
-Oh no, I'm headed back

14:03.008 --> 14:04.677
from an early dinner
with the Carols.

14:04.760 --> 14:08.764
-Wanna get a drink?
-I am horny for friendship.

14:08.847 --> 14:10.432
Am I saying that right?

14:10.516 --> 14:13.060
"Horny"? Can you guys
use that in a sentence?

14:13.143 --> 14:14.562
(laughs)
Hop in!

14:17.273 --> 14:19.942
(indistinct chatter)

14:20.025 --> 14:22.278
What do you gotta do
to flag down a penguin
around here?

14:22.361 --> 14:26.407
So, should I just,
uh, sit in the middle
of the table, or what?

14:26.490 --> 14:29.952
My bad.
I told them five,
but it's six.

14:30.035 --> 14:32.496
-Um, that's for a baby.
-It is?

14:32.580 --> 14:34.790
I swear to God
I did not realize that.

14:34.873 --> 14:36.542
I just thought it
was for a weak adult.

14:36.625 --> 14:38.127
Waiter, can we
get an adult chair,

14:38.210 --> 14:40.212
and 20 to 30 phone books
for the lady, please?

14:40.296 --> 14:43.549
Just-- Stop yelling.
It's fine. I'll-- This is fine.

14:43.632 --> 14:47.219
It's actually cool.
It's, uh, less like
a high chair for a baby,

14:47.303 --> 14:49.471
and more like
a, a throne for a queen.

14:49.555 --> 14:51.432
Yo, Candy?
You wearin' a diapee?

14:51.515 --> 14:53.434
Uh, yeah, I'm wearing a diaper.

14:53.517 --> 14:55.811
-(baby giggles)
-No, of course not.

14:55.894 --> 15:00.107
-Say "night night" 'cause
you're about to go down, elf.
-We'll see.

15:00.190 --> 15:03.319
Goldie:
Candy's snap was like
an alligator, Mrs. Claus.

15:03.402 --> 15:07.156
Chomp, chomp, chomp.
I'll never forget it.

15:07.239 --> 15:08.449
Neither will we!

15:08.532 --> 15:10.743
You've been talking
about it for an hour.

15:10.826 --> 15:12.661
I know you're upset, Goldie,

15:12.745 --> 15:15.497
but Candy's trying
to make history.

15:15.581 --> 15:16.957
And once she's
named Santa,

15:17.041 --> 15:18.375
she'll have
more time for us.

15:18.459 --> 15:22.588
(laughing)
More time?

15:22.671 --> 15:24.757
All Nick has done for 45 years

15:24.840 --> 15:27.468
since becoming
Successor is work!

15:27.551 --> 15:29.094
He doesn't have
time to go to movies,

15:29.178 --> 15:31.221
or have dinner alone with me,

15:31.305 --> 15:35.309
let alone, you know,
go down on me.

15:35.392 --> 15:37.686
Actually, it's been 20 years.

15:37.770 --> 15:39.855
What?
How do you 69?

15:39.938 --> 15:43.025
Well, we haven't
69'ed since '96.

15:43.108 --> 15:46.737
I remember it was '96 because
it was the night Tupac died.

15:46.820 --> 15:49.365
-So they say.
-Forget about all that now.

15:49.448 --> 15:51.200
You're on vacation.

15:51.283 --> 15:54.328
Let's take this party
to another level!

15:54.411 --> 15:55.829
(dance music playing)

15:55.913 --> 15:58.082
(crowd cheering)

16:00.459 --> 16:04.296
Is this it?
Is this dancing?
I love it!

16:05.547 --> 16:07.216
Santa:
Holy shit, it's me!

16:07.299 --> 16:09.218
An artist
is among us!

16:09.301 --> 16:12.388
Eh, just somethin'
I do with my bros
at home all the time.

16:12.471 --> 16:14.723
You're like
a dickless
Michelangelo

16:14.807 --> 16:16.392
of smoke ring
blowers!

16:16.475 --> 16:20.020
Cardinal Stryker:
It's as beautiful as the ceiling
of the Sistine Chapel.

16:20.104 --> 16:21.563
Suck on that, asshole.

16:21.647 --> 16:25.192
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
My men, watch this!

16:26.193 --> 16:28.779
-(applause)
-(cheers)

16:28.862 --> 16:30.781
You're a wizard
of the smoke!

16:30.864 --> 16:32.908
(Candy coughs and laughs)

16:32.991 --> 16:34.159
Candy:
Bros, bros!

16:34.243 --> 16:36.912
I got an amazing
joke for you.
A dirty one.

16:36.995 --> 16:38.580
It's gonna blow
your dicks off.

16:38.664 --> 16:41.417
-Oh, I see Junior's
already heard it.
-(table laughing)

16:41.500 --> 16:44.545
So, a pickle, a cucumber,
and a penis sit at a bar.

16:44.628 --> 16:47.423
Girls!
It's getting late.

16:47.506 --> 16:51.051
Why not keep
the party going,
Mrs. Claus?

16:51.135 --> 16:55.139
-Hey, what is your first name?
-Ugh, I hate it.

16:55.222 --> 16:57.141
My dad took it hard
when I was born

16:57.224 --> 16:58.600
because he got
a third daughter,

16:58.684 --> 17:01.270
so he named me
after himself...

17:01.353 --> 17:03.939
the son he
always wanted.

17:04.022 --> 17:06.775
-Woo! Yes!
-You go, Leonard!
Who's a hot bitch?

17:06.859 --> 17:09.945
-Leonard is!
-Woo-hoo!

17:10.028 --> 17:11.280
Candy:
So, the penis says,

17:11.363 --> 17:12.906
"What are you
complaining about--"

17:12.990 --> 17:14.825
They constantly wrap me
in a plastic bag,

17:14.908 --> 17:18.120
shove me in a cave,
and make me do push-ups
until I throw up!

17:18.203 --> 17:20.873
(laughing)

17:20.956 --> 17:23.041
That was my dirty joke!

17:23.125 --> 17:24.793
You're a very
amusing woman,

17:24.877 --> 17:26.795
but dirty jokes
sound better

17:26.879 --> 17:28.797
coming from
a low voice.

17:28.881 --> 17:30.340
And that's why
Vin Diesel

17:30.424 --> 17:32.926
will always be funnier
than Lucille Ball.

17:33.010 --> 17:34.428
(laughing)

17:34.511 --> 17:36.305
Ugh, this is out of control.

17:36.388 --> 17:38.682
The fact that the Board
of a giant company has

17:38.766 --> 17:40.184
this sexist attitude

17:40.267 --> 17:42.686
means we need
big changes
at Santa Inc.

17:42.770 --> 17:44.480
Nick!
It's happening again.

17:44.563 --> 17:47.608
You promised me
she wouldn't suck like
with that last speech.

17:47.691 --> 17:51.779
I'm having PTSD
from the swag bag
I never got.

17:51.862 --> 17:53.030
Me likey swag.

17:53.113 --> 17:56.742
Me likey free
frozen yogurt
machine.

17:56.825 --> 17:59.244
Candy, you promised
you wouldn't do this.

17:59.328 --> 18:01.789
Pull it together
and be impressive.

18:01.872 --> 18:05.292
Hey, look!
The tiramisu's in
the fuckin' house!

18:07.086 --> 18:09.630
(cries)

18:09.713 --> 18:11.507
Mrs. Claus:
Hello there.

18:11.590 --> 18:12.508
Hey, Mrs. Claus.

18:12.591 --> 18:14.092
It's weird
we built a whole

18:14.176 --> 18:15.511
tropical villa here

18:15.594 --> 18:18.096
when it's even colder
than the North Pole.

18:18.180 --> 18:19.807
(laughs)

18:19.890 --> 18:22.851
What a fucking
waste of money.

18:22.935 --> 18:24.812
What's going on?
You look sad.

18:24.895 --> 18:27.898
This night just showed me
my dream is a fucking joke.

18:27.981 --> 18:30.943
I feel like I should
just spare myself
more humiliation,

18:31.026 --> 18:32.194
and just call it a day.

18:32.277 --> 18:33.737
No, you can't!

18:33.821 --> 18:35.405
Before I married Santa,

18:35.489 --> 18:39.660
I wanted to
"be the change I wished
to see in the world."

18:39.743 --> 18:41.662
You know,
like Gandhi said.

18:41.745 --> 18:44.540
I never was
because I gave up.

18:44.623 --> 18:46.208
Don't do what I did.

18:46.291 --> 18:47.543
Yeah, I get it.

18:47.626 --> 18:49.002
Though I think that quote

18:49.086 --> 18:51.129
has actually been
misattributed to Gandhi.

18:51.213 --> 18:53.882
See?! That's why
you can't give up!

18:53.966 --> 18:57.386
I misattribute quotes
to Gandhi! You don't!

18:57.469 --> 19:01.056
And obviously,
there's a million other
amazing things about you,

19:01.139 --> 19:04.601
but I'm so
fucking wasted.

19:04.685 --> 19:09.982
Can you help me...
up, up, up?

19:10.065 --> 19:12.401
Yes, yes, of course.
Let's go.

19:12.484 --> 19:15.571
Please don't
give up!

19:15.654 --> 19:18.323
(intense music playing)

19:22.661 --> 19:24.329
Ooh, too little.

19:25.497 --> 19:28.208
Holy shit!
Nice one.

19:28.292 --> 19:32.754
Fuck. Fuck you. Fuck me.

19:32.838 --> 19:35.716
Fuckin' fuck. Fuck.

19:35.799 --> 19:37.593
Fuck my balls.

19:37.676 --> 19:38.719
Got a four!

19:38.802 --> 19:41.513
(laughs)
Oh, that is so cute.

19:45.350 --> 19:47.895
(indistinct chatter)

19:48.812 --> 19:49.855
(grunts)

19:50.689 --> 19:53.609
♪ ♪

19:53.692 --> 19:55.193
Santa:
Candy's the man!

19:55.277 --> 20:00.449
(chanting):
Candy's the man!
Candy's the man!

20:00.532 --> 20:02.117
Okay, okay.
A hole-in-one

20:02.201 --> 20:04.661
from the ladies'
tee is easy,

20:04.745 --> 20:06.705
but from back here,
that takes skill.

20:06.788 --> 20:09.583
-Watch this.
-Aw, he's right, you guys.

20:12.127 --> 20:15.547
Oh shit! He whacked that
tiny girl in the face!

20:15.631 --> 20:16.882
Come on!
I didn't even touch her!

20:16.965 --> 20:18.759
She'll never get
a husband now!

20:18.842 --> 20:20.594
-Ow, ow, ah!
-Poor, fragile woman!

20:20.677 --> 20:23.805
What if it was
my wife or daughter
or Virgin Mary?

20:23.889 --> 20:25.349
Candy:
Don't go into the light, Candy!

20:25.432 --> 20:26.850
Jesus Christ!

20:26.934 --> 20:28.602
Candy?
Can you, can you,
can you get up?

20:28.685 --> 20:31.897
I don't think so.
I'm even weaker than normal.

20:31.980 --> 20:33.357
-Liar!
-You just whacked this

20:33.440 --> 20:35.776
fuckin' woman in the head
with a golf club, dude.

20:35.859 --> 20:36.693
We all saw it!

20:36.777 --> 20:38.320
Stop lying
and apologize to her!

20:38.403 --> 20:40.530
Do you know who I am?
Who my father is?

20:40.614 --> 20:41.907
We are not liars.

20:41.990 --> 20:44.326
-That little piece
of elf trash is the liar!
-(gasps)

20:44.409 --> 20:47.245
I've spent this whole weekend
winnin' you assholes over,

20:47.329 --> 20:49.122
then, suddenly,
it's all about Candy?

20:49.206 --> 20:51.625
Her hole-in-one,
and then her other
hole-in-one!

20:51.708 --> 20:55.420
Not to mention we just said
"hole" 50 different times,

20:55.504 --> 20:57.130
and no one even
moved to ball tweak!

20:57.214 --> 20:58.674
What happened
to our inside joke?!

20:58.757 --> 21:02.177
Ball tweak, hole!
Ball tweak, ball tweak, hole!

21:02.260 --> 21:04.262
Ball tweak, ball tweak.
Give me them balls!

21:04.346 --> 21:05.347
Get 'em over here, line 'em up!

21:05.430 --> 21:07.432
You are outta control, man.

21:07.516 --> 21:09.184
This behavior
is fuckin' bullshit

21:09.267 --> 21:11.937
for both a gentleman
and future Successor.

21:12.020 --> 21:13.188
So, fuck you, stop it.

21:13.271 --> 21:15.190
Grrr.

21:15.273 --> 21:16.149
(Walrus groans)

21:22.656 --> 21:23.907
Hole!

21:23.991 --> 21:26.368
Man, it's hard
to watch Junior
come undone like that.

21:26.451 --> 21:27.411
That was fucked up.

21:27.494 --> 21:30.872
Chasing the Santa job
fucks with your head.

21:30.956 --> 21:32.874
Let's just say that...

21:32.958 --> 21:35.085
I did some shit
I am not proud of.

21:35.168 --> 21:39.089
Tell me. I need some gossip
to distract me from this pain.

21:39.172 --> 21:41.049
It's like this, I was born fat.

21:41.133 --> 21:44.094
Okay?
As a kid, an adult, always fat.

21:44.177 --> 21:46.638
But top heavy, you know,
like, like a big gut,

21:46.722 --> 21:49.057
but... nothin' below really.

21:49.141 --> 21:50.851
And, and I got hung up
about it, you know?

21:50.934 --> 21:53.562
N-No kid wants to go
see Santa and tell them
what they want for Christmas

21:53.645 --> 21:56.732
sitting on some bony-ass
fuckin' lap, right?

21:56.815 --> 21:59.234
So, right before
being named Successor,

21:59.317 --> 22:02.237
when the decision was
still up in the air...

22:02.320 --> 22:04.698
-I got lap implants.
-No shit!

22:04.781 --> 22:06.825
Let me
test drive this bitch.

22:06.908 --> 22:10.954
Woo! Ho-ho!
It's bouncy!

22:11.038 --> 22:13.582
It's cozy!
You'd never know
it was fake.

22:13.665 --> 22:15.709
Indestructible, too.
My lap used to look like

22:15.792 --> 22:18.712
a dick and balls
just like resting
on a wire coat hanger.

22:18.795 --> 22:20.130
It was fuckin' gross.

22:20.213 --> 22:24.217
But now, everything is
pure silicone and titanium.

22:24.301 --> 22:26.094
What can I say?
Goin' for the red suit...

22:26.178 --> 22:27.763
it'll make you
do strange things.

22:27.846 --> 22:29.431
Yeah, I know.

22:29.514 --> 22:32.476
Oh my god!
You set Junior up.

22:32.559 --> 22:34.311
-Is that horrible?
-Yes!

22:34.394 --> 22:35.645
You're playin'
the game, Candy.

22:35.729 --> 22:37.773
I'm impressed.
I didn't know
you had it in ya.

22:37.856 --> 22:40.192
Honestly, Santa,
neither did I.

22:40.275 --> 22:42.152
Hey, I was
wondering something:

22:42.235 --> 22:43.945
did you know anything
about what went on

22:44.029 --> 22:46.782
with the Christmas
Spirit bars?

22:46.865 --> 22:49.618
You know what? Forget it.
I, I didn't think you did.

22:50.410 --> 22:52.954
(ship horn blows)

22:53.038 --> 22:56.124
Look, you guys
haven't talked to me
since yesterday and I--

22:56.208 --> 22:59.252
I just wanted to say
I'm really sorry
about this weekend.

22:59.336 --> 23:02.297
You're doing
important shit.
We support you.

23:02.380 --> 23:03.673
But never snap
again, okay?

23:03.757 --> 23:06.927
It triggers me
to be very upset.

23:07.010 --> 23:09.679
Got it.
Never again.

23:09.763 --> 23:12.015
Hey, did I tell you?
The Board said I was

23:12.099 --> 23:15.268
"just like one of the guys."

23:15.352 --> 23:16.311
Isn't that cool?

23:16.394 --> 23:17.646
I don't know.
Is it?

23:17.729 --> 23:19.815
Yeah! I passed the test!

23:19.898 --> 23:22.484
Then we're happy
for you, Candy.

23:22.567 --> 23:24.903
Oh look!
There are my guys!

23:24.986 --> 23:28.448
-Oh! I missed you!
-Really?

23:28.532 --> 23:29.825
But are you
only being nice

23:29.908 --> 23:31.159
because you cheated
and feel guilty?

23:31.243 --> 23:33.120
'Cause I'm not being nice
because I fucked up

23:33.203 --> 23:34.538
and lost the baby
or anything like that,

23:34.621 --> 23:36.623
and like replaced the baby
with an old man or anything,

23:36.706 --> 23:37.791
everything went
fucking fine.

23:37.874 --> 23:40.418
I know you lost
Fun Size at the park.

23:40.502 --> 23:42.587
What?
I have a hundred trackers
baked into that kid.

23:42.671 --> 23:44.714
He was buried
in the sandbox
the whole time.

23:44.798 --> 23:47.843
Craig, your wife
is one smart Cookie.

23:50.137 --> 23:51.638
Hey, Grandpa.
What're you doing up?

23:51.721 --> 23:54.015
I only sleep
when every woman
in the North Pole

23:54.099 --> 23:57.018
has been sexually satisfied.
You know that.

23:57.102 --> 23:58.603
Right, I forgot.

23:58.687 --> 24:00.564
I guess I'm tired
from the jet lag.

24:00.647 --> 24:02.983
It's the same time zone,
but drilling through the Earth

24:03.066 --> 24:04.860
-can take it out of ya.
-I get it.

24:04.943 --> 24:07.279
You's is risin' to the top.
