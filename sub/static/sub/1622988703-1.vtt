Ooh, yeah, thank you.

01:48.331 --> 01:49.333
What you thinking?

01:50.400 --> 01:51.268
Excuse me?

01:52.870 --> 01:56.606
I can see you didn't
really like it

01:56.640 --> 01:59.277
so I was wondering
what you're thinking.

01:59.310 --> 02:03.314
Didn't realize I was
under surveillance.

02:03.346 --> 02:06.416
Just getting the vibe.

02:06.450 --> 02:07.484
What's wrong with it?

02:09.853 --> 02:11.522
Where do I start?

02:13.490 --> 02:15.793
I just... think there's
a bit much going on.

02:17.360 --> 02:20.497
The colors, yeah,
it's a bit busy.

02:20.531 --> 02:21.766
Gives me a headache.

02:21.799 --> 02:23.367
Right.

02:23.400 --> 02:24.635
What about you?

02:25.902 --> 02:28.805
It was definitely not
my best piece, but.

02:33.711 --> 02:34.912
- You painted this?
- Yeah.

02:36.080 --> 02:38.849
Oh my God, is this your event?

02:38.882 --> 02:40.418
Yeah.

02:40.450 --> 02:42.019
Oh my God, I'm so sorry.

02:42.051 --> 02:43.453
It's fine, honestly,
it's totally fine.

02:43.486 --> 02:44.587
No, I'm so sorry, it's not-

02:44.621 --> 02:45.790
Honestly, it's fine.

02:45.823 --> 02:47.058
I didn't mean to offend you.

02:47.091 --> 02:48.526
You didn't offend me,
it happens all the time.

02:48.558 --> 02:50.828
Thank you for trying
to make me feel better

02:50.860 --> 02:52.863
but I'm sure that's
not the case.

02:54.063 --> 02:56.366
Can I get you a drink
as a way of apologizing?

02:56.400 --> 02:57.001
No.

02:59.502 --> 03:00.437
- This is your event.
- Yeah.

03:00.471 --> 03:01.338
You're paying for the champagne.

03:01.372 --> 03:02.573
Yeah, its my champagne.

03:02.605 --> 03:04.709
I'm sorry, it's been
a really long day.

03:04.741 --> 03:06.343
Ah, fuck it.

03:09.379 --> 03:11.781
So what are you doing here?

03:11.814 --> 03:15.118
Clearly not for the
amazing art on the wall.

03:15.151 --> 03:17.754
Yeah, I was meant to
be meeting a friend

03:17.788 --> 03:18.656
and she bailed on me.

03:19.856 --> 03:21.425
She's the arty one.

03:21.457 --> 03:23.328
Right, do I know her?

03:24.961 --> 03:26.697
Sarah Quinn?

03:26.729 --> 03:28.566
I don't think she knew you.

03:28.598 --> 03:30.500
I think that she just,
she lives in the area.

03:30.533 --> 03:32.536
Just she has really
good taste in art.

03:33.770 --> 03:35.004
But not her friends.

03:35.038 --> 03:36.474
I'm sorry.

03:36.507 --> 03:38.542
Honestly, it's totally fine.

03:38.574 --> 03:40.744
A few of us are gonna go
out and grab some food after

03:40.777 --> 03:43.646
if you wanted to come and join.

03:43.680 --> 03:44.849
Oh, thank you.

03:46.917 --> 03:49.453
I can't this evening actually.

03:49.485 --> 03:50.987
No, it's fine, I
was just wondering.

03:51.020 --> 03:53.090
Maybe another time?

03:55.558 --> 03:57.694
Do you want to hear
more of my thoughts?

03:57.728 --> 04:00.164
Yes, I'd love to get
more of your thoughts.

04:00.197 --> 04:02.900
Critique my outfit or my...

04:04.634 --> 04:05.769
Oh.

04:05.802 --> 04:07.037
No, that would be really cool.

04:07.069 --> 04:09.906
- Should I take your number?
- Yeah, yeah.

04:11.641 --> 04:12.742
I'm Tess, by the way.

04:12.776 --> 04:14.478
Henry, nice to meet you, Tess.

04:14.510 --> 04:15.979
Nice to meet you.

04:16.012 --> 04:18.048
Their reaction was to go
completely the opposite way.

04:18.081 --> 04:19.682
Just ludicrous surrealism.

04:19.716 --> 04:22.720
Would you say that that's art?

04:22.752 --> 04:24.555
So is that what
you're aiming for?

04:28.492 --> 04:29.994
Alright, clearly my taste is-

04:30.026 --> 04:33.764
No, no, but how is it
going for you actually?

04:33.797 --> 04:36.901
- It's going fine, it's okay.
- Just okay?

04:38.035 --> 04:40.138
Could be better, but-

04:41.672 --> 04:43.707
Have you ever sold anything?

04:43.740 --> 04:46.043
Well from the exhibition
or like in general?

04:47.577 --> 04:49.846
From the exhibition or
I don't know in general?

04:52.850 --> 04:54.552
You don't think
I've sold anything?

04:54.584 --> 04:55.718
No, I do.

04:55.752 --> 04:57.555
Okay, I think we've established

04:57.588 --> 04:59.790
I'm not your target audience.

04:59.822 --> 05:03.661
But there were lots
of people there.

05:03.694 --> 05:05.062
Someone must have
bought something.

05:05.095 --> 05:07.131
I did, I sold a couple.

05:07.163 --> 05:09.933
- Well, congratulations.
- Thank you.

05:09.966 --> 05:11.668
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

05:16.240 --> 05:19.043
How much would one
of your paintings be?

05:20.177 --> 05:21.679
I'm just interested.

05:22.779 --> 05:25.849
Okay, well, like the one that
you really, really liked.

05:26.850 --> 05:27.852
For example.

05:27.884 --> 05:28.718
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

05:29.586 --> 05:31.889
You know, it was about 800.

05:31.922 --> 05:32.790
Wow.

05:33.824 --> 05:34.925
What, is that a lot?

05:37.860 --> 05:39.764
Have you ever been up the Shard?

05:41.064 --> 05:43.834
I haven't actually,
I've been around it.

05:43.867 --> 05:44.935
Around it.

05:44.968 --> 05:46.670
Base, I've been around the base.

05:46.702 --> 05:47.537
Like Borough Market?

05:47.571 --> 05:48.773
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

05:49.805 --> 05:50.942
I love it down there.

05:52.141 --> 05:54.245
Have you ever been to
that pasta restaurant?

05:54.278 --> 05:55.679
Which one is that?

05:55.711 --> 05:58.915
It's called Pa-day-a or
Padella or something?

05:58.949 --> 06:00.550
It's like an offshoot of one

06:00.584 --> 06:03.853
and it's meant to be
the most amazing pasta.

06:03.887 --> 06:04.654
Is it good, have you been?

06:04.687 --> 06:06.789
I've been to the
original restaurant.

06:06.822 --> 06:08.758
Yeah, it's really good.

06:08.791 --> 06:10.527
How long have you
been in London?

06:12.896 --> 06:15.266
Been about 10 years.

06:15.298 --> 06:16.733
Wow, really?

06:16.766 --> 06:18.870
Yeah, I don't think
I ever wanna leave.

06:21.872 --> 06:23.841
I just feel like it
has the ability to,

06:25.007 --> 06:26.743
I dunno, you know
when you have like,

06:26.776 --> 06:27.978
you know when you
have like a shit time

06:28.011 --> 06:31.849
it picks you up and
sorry, I'm just rambling.

06:31.882 --> 06:33.050
Yeah, you are.

06:33.083 --> 06:36.954
No, honestly, I totally,
I get what you mean.

06:36.987 --> 06:40.724
It's like an old friend
or something, isn't it?

06:40.757 --> 06:43.961
It knows all your secrets but
doesn't judge you for them.

06:43.994 --> 06:45.530
Yeah, exactly.

06:48.764 --> 06:50.700
- Cold, you cold?
- Yeah.

06:50.733 --> 06:53.169
Do you want my jacket?

06:53.202 --> 06:54.003
No, I'm fine.

06:56.072 --> 06:58.174
I'm an independent man.

06:59.875 --> 07:01.077
Never said you weren't.

07:05.882 --> 07:07.685
What do you want to do?

07:09.218 --> 07:12.156
I don't know, should
we have a walk or?

07:31.675 --> 07:32.977
Or kiss.

07:37.781 --> 07:39.083
I had a really nice day.

07:44.754 --> 07:49.058
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

07:49.091 --> 07:50.693
My mom made us some breakfast.

07:50.726 --> 07:51.861
Your mom?

07:51.894 --> 07:55.031
Yeah, it's my Mom's place.

07:55.064 --> 07:55.865
I'm joking!

07:55.899 --> 07:57.935
It's not my mom's
place, its my place.

07:57.968 --> 08:02.338
I have got you a little full
English Henry extravaganza.

08:02.372 --> 08:04.742
Oh, thank you.

08:04.774 --> 08:07.377
Did you forget I'm
actually vegetarian?

08:07.411 --> 08:09.079
Oh fuck.

08:09.112 --> 08:11.814
No, it's so nice of you.

08:11.848 --> 08:13.317
- So sorry.
- No, its fine.

08:13.350 --> 08:15.119
- Bollocks.
- Thank you.

08:15.151 --> 08:16.319
- Oh, well.
- Sorry.

08:16.353 --> 08:18.989
- Do you like coffee?
- I love coffee.

08:19.021 --> 08:21.858
Good, okay, you like it black?

08:22.992 --> 08:24.260
- Jesus Christ!
- Oh shit, sorry!

08:24.293 --> 08:26.963
Oh shit, oh fuck.

08:27.831 --> 08:30.033
- Okay, just don't worry.
- No, no, no, no,

08:30.067 --> 08:32.068
these are fucking, these
are quite important sheets.

08:32.101 --> 08:34.071
- Oh, that's fucked.
- Important sheets?

08:34.104 --> 08:36.273
Yes, these are
actually my Mom's.

08:36.306 --> 08:38.107
These are honestly her favorite.

08:38.140 --> 08:39.708
Can you just get out,
I need to change it?

08:39.743 --> 08:41.245
Oh no, I'm sorry,
I'm sorry, okay.

08:41.278 --> 08:42.946
Oh fuck.

08:42.979 --> 08:44.248
Can you not just leave,
I think it will come out.

08:44.280 --> 08:45.415
It's just-

08:45.448 --> 08:46.382
It's kind of the
same color, isn't it?

08:46.416 --> 08:48.085
Yeah.

08:48.118 --> 08:50.153
I'll just have to tell her
that you soiled the sheets.

08:50.187 --> 08:51.388
Nice.

08:51.421 --> 08:53.157
Yeah, like Spud in
"Trainspotting."

08:53.190 --> 08:55.893
- What's that?
- Spud in "Trainspotting."

08:55.926 --> 08:58.095
Please tell me you've
seen "Trainspotting."

08:58.128 --> 08:58.961
No.

08:58.995 --> 09:00.297
You haven't seen
"Trainspotting," my God.

09:00.330 --> 09:01.764
Sorry.

09:01.798 --> 09:03.734
Oh my God, okay, well
I'm gonna forget that

09:03.767 --> 09:04.902
but there's a scene in it where,

09:04.934 --> 09:08.771
okay, the character Spud, he's
one of the characters in it

09:08.804 --> 09:10.707
played by Ewen Bremner,
which isn't important,

09:10.740 --> 09:13.342
but anyway, he goes and
stays at his girlfriend's,

09:13.375 --> 09:14.911
who lives with her
parents at their house

09:14.945 --> 09:16.346
'cause he's coming off heroin.

09:16.379 --> 09:18.416
He gets loosey, goosey bowels,

09:20.817 --> 09:25.022
anyway, he wakes up and
he's kind of soiled himself

09:25.054 --> 09:28.224
so he gets the duvet and gathers
it up and goes downstairs

09:28.258 --> 09:29.460
to put it in the washing machine

09:29.493 --> 09:31.128
but the Mom and the
Dad and girlfriend

09:31.160 --> 09:32.929
were down there
having their breakfast

09:32.962 --> 09:37.100
and then the Mom says I'll
put it in the washing machine

09:37.134 --> 09:40.137
and then he says no, I'll do it.

09:40.169 --> 09:42.171
And they kind of just tussle

09:42.205 --> 09:46.477
and the sheets pull
apart and shit just...

09:49.145 --> 09:51.214
splatters on everyone's face.

09:51.248 --> 09:54.785
Oh, gotta see that movie.

09:54.817 --> 09:55.452
Yeah.

09:57.153 --> 09:58.956
The way you described
is like wow.

10:00.090 --> 10:02.158
There's more to
the film than that.

10:02.192 --> 10:04.094
I don't know why
I just said that.

10:04.126 --> 10:06.963
No, it's good, it's nice
kind of like mood setter.

10:06.996 --> 10:07.964
Yeah.

10:10.000 --> 10:12.168
Careful, you're in
the fucking coffee.

10:19.109 --> 10:20.310
Where's the one place

10:20.342 --> 10:22.211
that you wanna go
to in the world

10:22.245 --> 10:24.215
that you haven't been
to before you die?

10:27.017 --> 10:29.153
What? before I die?

10:29.186 --> 10:30.320
This is a
serious question.

10:30.352 --> 10:32.155
Yeah, but why do I have to die?

10:32.188 --> 10:36.126
Couldn't it just be
someplace I wanna go to?

10:37.193 --> 10:38.428
Unless I'm ill.

10:43.133 --> 10:43.934
Okay.

10:44.900 --> 10:45.501
You've traveled, right?

10:45.534 --> 10:46.336
You have a passport?

10:48.004 --> 10:50.106
Yes, I have a passport.

10:50.139 --> 10:52.842
And yeah, I'm really
well-traveled.

10:52.875 --> 10:54.310
Ireland doesn't count.

10:54.344 --> 10:56.280
Okay, I'm not that
well-traveled.

11:00.250 --> 11:02.485
- California.
- California?

11:02.519 --> 11:04.522
- Yeah.
- Why California?

11:09.359 --> 11:13.230
Everyone just seems really
friendly over there.

11:13.263 --> 11:16.466
Positive and it's really sunny.

11:17.900 --> 11:19.302
- Liberal.
- Liberal.

11:20.202 --> 11:21.371
Yes, liberal.

11:22.572 --> 11:26.009
Okay well, let's
go to California.

11:27.009 --> 11:30.114
- What now?
- Someday, you and me.

11:32.282 --> 11:33.417
- California?
- Yeah.

11:34.283 --> 11:35.519
- Okay.
- All right.

11:37.187 --> 11:39.322
- Okay.
- Yeah.

11:41.091 --> 11:44.394
- Bye.
- I'll see you tonight.

11:44.427 --> 11:48.231
I'll see you tonight?

11:48.264 --> 11:49.066
Hello?

13:10.379 --> 13:12.649
- Did you sleep okay?
- Not really.

13:12.682 --> 13:13.584
- Really?
- No.

13:15.018 --> 13:19.623
- Did I snore?
- You do snore a little bit.

13:20.724 --> 13:21.458
- Did you know that?
- No, fuck off.

13:22.759 --> 13:24.961
No one has ever told
me I've snored, so.

13:26.261 --> 13:27.964
I'll record it next time.

13:27.998 --> 13:29.399
You snore and you dribble
a little bit as well.

13:29.432 --> 13:31.668
- Like this.
- No, can you-

13:35.337 --> 13:36.572
That's you.

13:36.605 --> 13:39.208
Okay, changing the subject.

13:41.378 --> 13:42.446
Disgusting myself.

13:48.317 --> 13:50.754
- Dribbled on my leg.
- Sorry.

13:50.787 --> 13:52.322
What the fuck?

13:53.389 --> 13:54.390
Oh my God.

13:55.591 --> 14:00.364
Okay, here's a top
tip from Cosmo.

14:01.297 --> 14:02.365
Go on, tip me.

14:03.799 --> 14:08.738
Okay, nights when you can't
sleep, count octopus feet.

14:09.673 --> 14:11.375
- Count octopus feet?
- Yeah, it works a treat.

14:12.808 --> 14:13.677
Count to eight?

14:15.644 --> 14:19.316
Or, or, if you
don't like that one,

14:19.349 --> 14:24.054
burning tigers,
works every time.

14:24.086 --> 14:25.621
Why have they got to be on fire?

14:25.654 --> 14:30.192
I don't know, I just,
someone told me.

14:30.225 --> 14:31.360
That they have to be on fire?

14:31.394 --> 14:33.397
Yeah, it works.

14:33.429 --> 14:36.500
Or I could just give you a
nudge and stop your snoring.

14:38.400 --> 14:39.602
- Sure.
- And dribbling.

14:44.307 --> 14:46.377
I'm actually, I'm done.

14:48.244 --> 14:49.546
You not having anymore?

14:55.418 --> 14:56.753
I should actually wash my face.

14:56.785 --> 14:58.488
Please, please do.

15:00.856 --> 15:02.225
Do you want a
tissue or something?

15:02.258 --> 15:04.394
No, got my sleeve.

15:19.741 --> 15:21.610
Stop looking at me.

15:21.644 --> 15:23.480
Why are we watching this?

15:23.513 --> 15:27.384
Just please, it's good, just
give it like 10 minutes.

15:27.417 --> 15:30.454
It's literally the
worst human beings

15:30.486 --> 15:33.722
on the planet all together.

15:33.755 --> 15:36.725
I don't get it, what's the
point in watching this?

15:36.759 --> 15:39.462
It's just so entertaining.

15:44.267 --> 15:45.102
Entertaining?

15:46.102 --> 15:48.504
It also is actually kind
of interesting to watch

15:48.538 --> 15:50.573
from just the
perspective of like

15:50.606 --> 15:55.444
just the way men deal with a
situation compared to women.

15:55.477 --> 15:57.780
All right, so it's a piece
of social commentary.

15:57.813 --> 15:59.515
Yes, thank you.

16:01.783 --> 16:03.385
I mean, I literally
feel about 30% dumber

16:03.418 --> 16:05.521
since it started, which
is about two minutes ago.

16:05.554 --> 16:07.389
Oh, shut up.

16:07.423 --> 16:12.428
Okay, it's this guy, he came
in like a week ago or something

16:13.596 --> 16:16.533
and then you see the
girl in the pink.

16:16.566 --> 16:17.468
Yeah, I see her.

16:18.500 --> 16:19.802
- With the real.
- Yeah.

16:21.538 --> 16:22.572
The real.

16:23.472 --> 16:25.608
So he, sorry.

16:29.278 --> 16:30.179
Oh my God.

16:31.548 --> 16:34.583
Sorry, he made a play for her,

16:34.616 --> 16:38.154
even though she's kind in
a relationship or whatever.

16:38.187 --> 16:42.391
So now tonight's episode is
gonna be like the repercussion.

16:42.424 --> 16:43.259
Okay.

16:45.461 --> 16:46.496
Oh wow.

16:51.868 --> 16:53.203
He made a play for her?

16:54.470 --> 16:57.206
Then how come he's doing
that with that one?

16:57.240 --> 16:58.307
Don't know.

16:59.942 --> 17:00.776
- Oh.
- Oh.

17:19.493 --> 17:20.863
He's a dick.

17:20.896 --> 17:22.898
He's a complete penis.

17:25.634 --> 17:27.604
I still don't get it.

17:56.566 --> 18:00.937
♪ Don't you know how much ♪

18:00.970 --> 18:03.874
♪ I don't love you ♪

18:09.912 --> 18:12.749
♪ Don't you know ♪

18:22.959 --> 18:27.730

18:35.738 --> 18:40.611

19:41.002 --> 19:42.004
- Okay?
- Yeah.

20:34.457 --> 20:35.692
I don't mean to be intrusive

20:35.724 --> 20:37.793
but it smells like
something's burning.

20:37.826 --> 20:38.961
Yeah, yeah.

20:48.738 --> 20:53.576
Okay, this, there we go.

20:53.608 --> 20:57.146
- Wow.
- There I go.

20:57.180 --> 21:00.817
This looks, I don't know.

21:00.849 --> 21:02.551
Well, it's all in the taste.

21:02.585 --> 21:04.487
Don't know how this looks.

21:04.519 --> 21:05.622
Okay.

21:05.654 --> 21:10.026
Try it, it's not gonna kill you.

21:12.662 --> 21:13.663
- Try it.
- Okay.

21:15.765 --> 21:16.600
Huh?

21:17.732 --> 21:19.735
Little crunchy maybe?

21:26.808 --> 21:28.211
Good?

21:28.243 --> 21:29.846
Really good?

21:29.878 --> 21:31.580
Really, really good?

21:31.614 --> 21:33.616
One really, really good?

21:36.117 --> 21:36.919
It's good.

21:36.952 --> 21:38.788
It's not good, is it?

21:38.820 --> 21:39.888
Shut up.

21:39.922 --> 21:41.458
Oh God, it's repulsive,
I'm so sorry.

21:41.490 --> 21:42.724
What?

21:42.758 --> 21:44.626
Let me try some.

21:44.660 --> 21:45.461
No way.

21:48.663 --> 21:49.465
Fucking hell.

21:50.566 --> 21:53.002
- Inedible.
- That is disgusting.

21:56.838 --> 22:01.744
Oh my God, oh my God, fuck
you Ottolenghi, Jesus Christ.

22:03.546 --> 22:05.015
I followed the recipe.

22:06.682 --> 22:09.919
Did the recipe say anything
about burning the artichokes

22:09.951 --> 22:11.988
to tiny particles?

22:12.020 --> 22:13.789
It said hold them
over the stove.

22:14.856 --> 22:17.961
- Jesus, I'm so sorry.
- Don't worry.

22:17.993 --> 22:19.862
- I'm so sorry.
- No, don't worry.

22:19.895 --> 22:21.865
Thank you for trying.

22:21.897 --> 22:24.266
Yeah, thank you
for patronizing me.

22:24.299 --> 22:29.004
I'm not, I'm not, look,
it can happen to people.

22:29.038 --> 22:33.809
But just, just,
just promise you,

22:33.843 --> 22:36.179
just promise you
won't do it again.

22:36.211 --> 22:37.846
Yeah, I promise.

22:37.880 --> 22:39.682
What do you wanna do?

22:39.714 --> 22:41.750
- Oh God.
- Should we order in?

22:41.784 --> 22:44.821
- Yeah, I think so.
- I'm so sorry.

22:44.854 --> 22:47.923
Oh, honestly, you
tried, but can you,

22:47.957 --> 22:50.927
do you want to move it?

22:51.894 --> 22:53.128
It's bad, isn't it?

22:53.162 --> 22:56.031
Sorry, just the smell,
it's like into my nostrils.

23:03.972 --> 23:06.075
- Awe.
- What?

23:06.107 --> 23:08.944
I feel so bad but
thank you for trying.

23:12.949 --> 23:14.584
What should we get?

23:15.984 --> 23:17.219
Not that.

23:17.252 --> 23:19.556
Yeah, I think I had
that excuse last time.

23:20.756 --> 23:22.191
Do you know what though?

23:22.223 --> 23:23.157
Quite a lot of people showed up

23:23.159 --> 23:23.993
and I sold a couple paintings.

23:24.026 --> 23:25.295
Nice, good work.

23:25.327 --> 23:26.895
Thanks, man, I was really happy.

23:26.929 --> 23:28.730
- Really happy.
- Nice work, put on a show.

23:35.871 --> 23:37.874
All right, tell me what is it?

23:41.644 --> 23:44.780
Maybe met a lady.

23:44.814 --> 23:46.015
So that's your
look of love is it?

23:46.048 --> 23:48.984
Yeah, no man, I met
this really nice girl.

23:49.018 --> 23:51.153
- Oh, what's her name?
- Tess.

23:51.186 --> 23:52.821
What does Tess do?

23:52.855 --> 23:55.959
Tess is a lawyer.

23:55.991 --> 23:59.295
Yeah, well triple
threat, actually.

23:59.327 --> 24:04.032
She's really sound
and very pretty.

24:04.066 --> 24:09.072
Yeah, so I'm just waiting
to fuck it up to be honest.

24:09.939 --> 24:10.840
Why would you fuck it up?

24:10.873 --> 24:12.208
I don't know, I just feel like,

24:12.240 --> 24:14.876
we just, we're very different.

24:14.910 --> 24:17.747
Opposites attract,
everybody knows that.

24:18.913 --> 24:20.817
I wouldn't worry about
it, man, it's fine.

24:22.018 --> 24:23.019
Do you know what,
coming from you, Johnny,

24:23.051 --> 24:26.822
the absolute Don
of relationships,

24:26.855 --> 24:27.990
I think the longest one
you've ever had is what,

24:28.023 --> 24:29.024
about a week?

24:29.057 --> 24:29.959
Low blow.

24:29.991 --> 24:31.259
That means a lot, honestly.

24:31.292 --> 24:34.262
That's fair, look, it's
time to celebrate I think.

24:34.296 --> 24:35.932
Another pint?

24:35.964 --> 24:37.066
No, I'm good actually.

24:37.098 --> 24:38.134
I'll just finish that and then-

24:38.166 --> 24:41.069
Come on, man, celebrate
your new love, a few beers.

24:41.103 --> 24:43.873
I am actually quite
skint at the moment, so.

24:43.905 --> 24:46.041
I'll get them in, it's fine.

24:46.075 --> 24:47.009
I'm whittling the
cash or something.

24:47.042 --> 24:49.812
Dude, no, I'm all right
with cash, thank you.

24:50.945 --> 24:52.047
Thank you, I don't
wanna take your money.

24:52.080 --> 24:54.116
I don't like borrowing money,
I'm all right, thank you.

24:54.150 --> 24:55.817
Don't be an idiot.

24:55.851 --> 24:57.086
I'm working my hole off
for this fucking arsehole.

24:57.118 --> 24:58.286
Might as well give a
bit of cash to you.

24:58.319 --> 25:01.289
Have a good time with
your new lady friend.

25:01.323 --> 25:04.192
- Come on.
- Another pint.

25:04.226 --> 25:06.429
Right, deal, another
pint, let's do it.

25:06.461 --> 25:07.730
I'm cool with that.

25:10.031 --> 25:11.067
Maybe water for you.

25:13.903 --> 25:14.738
Okay.

25:17.105 --> 25:19.107
- Did you write it?
- Yeah.

25:19.141 --> 25:20.944
I'm actually a bit
nervous to read it.

25:21.943 --> 25:23.046
- Be kind.
- I will.

25:28.049 --> 25:31.119
I'm in all kinds of trouble now.

25:31.153 --> 25:33.122
The kind where you
wake up on a train

25:33.154 --> 25:36.925
and everything,
everything's strange.

25:37.826 --> 25:38.827
And where am I?

25:38.861 --> 25:41.030
And when did the seasons change?

25:41.063 --> 25:41.998
I must've been asleep.

25:42.030 --> 25:44.033
I'm sure I must be late.

25:45.867 --> 25:48.037
I'm in all kinds of danger.

25:48.069 --> 25:51.441
The stranger on the platform
is not a proper stranger.

25:51.473 --> 25:54.043
You're here with me, she says.

25:56.178 --> 25:57.080
Isn't it great?

25:58.180 --> 25:58.981
And she's right.

26:03.184 --> 26:05.053
The kind where there's too
much meaning on the edges

26:05.086 --> 26:08.924
of sites because she might be
there and you randomly weep.

26:09.925 --> 26:14.129
I'm in deep, deep, hot water
in a boiling hot geyser

26:14.163 --> 26:18.166
in the mist of the mist of
the ridiculous Icelandic snow.

26:18.200 --> 26:21.203
You know you should give
up the fags and eat fruit

26:21.237 --> 26:23.907
because life should last longer.

26:24.973 --> 26:28.010
This life should last longer
if someone like her exists.

26:29.878 --> 26:33.182
Everybody, lock away your razors

26:33.214 --> 26:35.083
and save your lovely wrists.

26:35.116 --> 26:37.886
Someone like her exists.

26:37.920 --> 26:41.057
I'm in every single
kind of trouble now,

26:42.258 --> 26:46.796
the kind where a man could write
himself a significant part.

26:48.931 --> 26:53.036
I'm in very grave danger
of a change of heart.

27:02.845 --> 27:04.213
That was amazing.

27:07.449 --> 27:09.018
Is it someone from work?

27:09.050 --> 27:09.951
Is it Don?

27:09.984 --> 27:11.887
- No.
- No, oh my God.

27:13.288 --> 27:16.959
Okay, his name's Henry
and he's an artist.

27:16.991 --> 27:19.361
- Famous artist?
- No, not famous.

27:19.394 --> 27:21.330
I mean, he'd like to
be famous, but no.

27:24.165 --> 27:25.801
- Yes.
- Tell us more.

27:27.269 --> 27:31.374
Well he's he's very
scruffy like a puppy.

27:31.406 --> 27:34.943
And he's a terrible cook.

27:34.977 --> 27:37.580
Oh no, no, no, no, get
rid of him right now.

27:37.613 --> 27:41.284
- Is he vegetarian?
- No, he likes meat.

27:41.317 --> 27:42.919
He actually eats a lot of meat.

27:42.951 --> 27:47.156
And the reason you're
dating again is what?

27:48.891 --> 27:50.794
I know, no, it's good.

27:51.861 --> 27:53.329
Where'd you meet?

27:53.362 --> 27:56.165
We met at one of his
exhibitions in the,

27:56.198 --> 27:58.201
you know the gallery behind
the disused fire station

27:58.233 --> 27:59.101
- in Greenwich.
- I know.

27:59.134 --> 28:01.971
So I was there, I was
going to meet Sarah.

28:02.003 --> 28:03.405
She bailed obviously.

28:03.439 --> 28:05.608
And so standing in
front of this picture

28:05.641 --> 28:08.144
and then this guy comes
over to me and he's like,

28:08.176 --> 28:10.111
what do you think
of this painting?

28:10.144 --> 28:13.316
Which to be honest,
was pretty shit.

28:14.583 --> 28:17.887
It wasn't shit but
it wasn't great.

28:17.920 --> 28:20.256
Anyway, so I started telling
him like what I like,

28:20.288 --> 28:22.023
what I don't like,
this and that.

28:22.057 --> 28:23.960
Oh God, I can see
where this is going.

28:23.992 --> 28:27.429
So then I turned to him and
I was like, what about you?

28:27.462 --> 28:29.130
What do you think?

28:29.163 --> 28:31.901
And he turns to
me and he's like.

34:36.565 --> 34:40.503
I didn't tell you I was
terrified of heights.

34:41.503 --> 34:42.471
Did I mention?

34:48.543 --> 34:49.579
And it was your idea.

34:52.547 --> 34:53.583
Yeah.

35:05.594 --> 35:07.597
So many buildings
just popping up.

35:08.730 --> 35:09.764
So many cranes.

35:10.831 --> 35:12.000
Who's living in them?

35:17.539 --> 35:18.441
It's mad.

35:20.641 --> 35:21.876
Hey, I was thinking
we should go away

35:21.909 --> 35:24.346
for the bank holiday
weekend, somewhere nice.

35:26.947 --> 35:27.750
I don't know.

35:27.782 --> 35:29.351
What, why?

35:31.652 --> 35:32.754
I've got quite a lot
on at the moment.

35:33.789 --> 35:36.925
- Like what?
- Like on my paintings.

35:36.958 --> 35:37.960
I've got the exhibition
in September,

35:37.992 --> 35:39.795
I can't just drop things.

35:39.827 --> 35:41.563
Yeah, you can.

35:41.596 --> 35:43.532
You don't have to drop
them, but you're freelance.

35:43.565 --> 35:44.967
You can take a weekend.

35:47.402 --> 35:49.304
Please, work's been so hectic.

35:49.338 --> 35:51.307
I could already do
with a weekend away.

35:52.507 --> 35:54.909
It's the only weekend that we'll
be able to do it this year.

36:00.681 --> 36:01.616
It's not just that,

36:01.650 --> 36:03.318
I can't really afford to
go away at the moment.

36:04.985 --> 36:08.623
Don't worry about it, my treat.

36:08.657 --> 36:12.695
No, no, no, I don't, I'm
not letting you do that.

36:12.728 --> 36:15.630
Okay, well, you pay me back.

36:16.965 --> 36:19.702
In September, just
sell out your show.

36:19.735 --> 36:20.670
Oh, okay.

36:22.137 --> 36:23.639
- Easy?
- Yeah, fine.

36:23.672 --> 36:25.474
I'll make sure it sells out.

36:25.507 --> 36:26.775
No, honestly, I don't mind.

36:33.481 --> 36:34.682
I just don't like it.

36:34.715 --> 36:37.752
I don't like owing people money.

36:37.786 --> 36:38.753
Okay.

36:38.786 --> 36:39.620
Don't worry.

36:39.655 --> 36:41.890
Sorry, it just doesn't
sit well with me.

36:41.922 --> 36:42.757
Okay.

36:48.063 --> 36:51.800
Just bare with me, picture this.

36:53.467 --> 36:58.473
You and me on a beach,
somewhere in the Aegean Sea.

36:59.574 --> 37:03.746
Just like white sand,
turquoise water,

37:04.880 --> 37:06.816
no stress, no work.

37:09.784 --> 37:13.021
- Free cocktails.
- Sounds really horrible.

37:14.755 --> 37:15.790
Or we could just stay here.

37:15.824 --> 37:17.025
Yeah, of course.

37:17.057 --> 37:21.630
Look, brown Thames,
beautiful gray skies.

37:21.663 --> 37:22.931
Yeah, tropical.

37:22.963 --> 37:24.866
I'm sorry, you're
right, you're right.

37:24.900 --> 37:29.905
It would be, it sounds
nice, let's do it.

37:32.807 --> 37:33.942
Yay.

37:33.974 --> 37:36.677
And I'll sell out my exhibition.

37:36.710 --> 37:38.780
Perfect, deal.

37:42.617 --> 37:43.885
No, it'll be really nice.

38:25.827 --> 38:26.695
Hello?

38:26.728 --> 38:28.496
Hey, sorry, hi Jack.

38:29.831 --> 38:31.500
Yeah, it's going good, man.

38:31.532 --> 38:33.601
Just in the studio
at the moment.

38:33.635 --> 38:34.970
Just working on the new series.

38:36.070 --> 38:37.806
Thanks, yeah, I know,
it's going well.

38:37.838 --> 38:38.940
I'm happy with it.

38:43.143 --> 38:44.145
What's that?

38:46.847 --> 38:47.715
What do you mean?

38:49.650 --> 38:50.952
They can't just
do that, can they?

38:54.822 --> 38:56.224
He's fucking serious?

38:57.925 --> 38:58.927
That's their reason?

39:01.963 --> 39:05.834
Man, I've, can we
get another one?

39:05.867 --> 39:07.769
Can we get another
gallery to take it?

39:10.304 --> 39:11.606
And what did they say?

39:13.807 --> 39:16.945
Jack, I'm really fucking
broke at the moment.

39:19.114 --> 39:20.816
Dude, I seriously
need this, man.

39:27.121 --> 39:28.490
All right, all right.

39:50.077 --> 39:50.878
Fuck!

39:55.684 --> 39:56.519
Fuck!

40:09.063 --> 40:10.065
So as you
would have seen

40:10.097 --> 40:11.933
from your written appraisal

40:11.967 --> 40:14.570
you've exceeded our expectations,
really well done, Tess.

40:14.603 --> 40:16.104
We've been very impressed
by your commitment

40:16.137 --> 40:18.173
and the hours you've
put in, really.

40:18.206 --> 40:19.841
There are obvious
areas to improve in

40:19.873 --> 40:21.842
as expected from every
associate of your level.

40:21.876 --> 40:24.746
One of the areas we highlighted
is business development.

40:24.778 --> 40:26.949
I know, it's hard.

40:26.981 --> 40:29.684
It is hard at your level

40:29.717 --> 40:30.885
to find a network of people

40:30.918 --> 40:33.688
that will eventually give you
work, especially in disputes.

40:33.722 --> 40:35.591
It's tricky,
because as you know,

40:35.623 --> 40:38.759
unlike corporate where you
can get repetitive work,

40:38.793 --> 40:40.662
you know, with us we must
create a network of people

40:40.695 --> 40:43.065
that will think of us
whenever a problem occurs.

40:43.864 --> 40:46.033
And you will never know
when that will happen

40:46.067 --> 40:47.735
which is why you've
gotta get out there,

40:47.768 --> 40:50.137
over and over again.

40:50.170 --> 40:52.340
Because when somebody instructs
you as a dispute lawyer

40:52.373 --> 40:54.076
they will instruct you because
you're the first person

40:54.108 --> 40:56.010
on their mind basically.

40:56.043 --> 40:56.911
And that's only gonna happen

40:56.945 --> 40:58.380
if you were the last
person they heard from

40:58.413 --> 41:01.650
and you will never know
who that person will be.

41:01.682 --> 41:03.318
It could be a friend.

41:03.351 --> 41:07.856
It could be a former client,
it's worth remembering.

41:08.856 --> 41:11.059
Okay, well congratulations.

41:11.092 --> 41:12.894
You should be
really proud, Tess.

41:12.927 --> 41:14.630
Thank you, thanks.

41:25.072 --> 41:26.375
- Are you gonna ask?
- Hmm?

41:28.242 --> 41:33.081
How it went to
today, my appraisal.

41:33.114 --> 41:36.217
Oh shit, sorry, sorry.

41:42.123 --> 41:44.291
Are you gonna ask?

41:44.324 --> 41:47.762
Yeah, yeah, I was gonna ask.

41:47.795 --> 41:52.333
I was just, my, sorry,
I just had a bad day.

41:52.367 --> 41:56.004
What happened?

41:56.036 --> 41:59.206
I don't wanna talk about it.

41:59.239 --> 42:01.409
Henry, you're gonna just
sit here in silence?

42:01.443 --> 42:03.111
Yeah, yeah, do you
know what, Tess,

42:03.143 --> 42:04.278
I'm just gonna sit in silence.

42:04.311 --> 42:06.414
I just don't wanna
fucking talk anymore.

42:06.447 --> 42:09.050
Just tell me what happened.

42:10.251 --> 42:11.086
Please.

42:12.152 --> 42:13.688
What happened?

42:13.722 --> 42:18.427
- They pulled my exhibition.
- What?

42:20.894 --> 42:22.396
- Mm.
- Who did?

42:22.429 --> 42:24.165
The gallery.

42:24.199 --> 42:25.934
Can they do that?

42:25.967 --> 42:28.836
I don't know, I don't
know, apparently yes.

42:28.869 --> 42:30.304
Apparently they
can just pull it.

42:31.405 --> 42:32.773
Have you seen a contract?

42:32.806 --> 42:34.709
No, I haven't seen a contract.

42:34.742 --> 42:35.476
I don't do contracts.

42:35.510 --> 42:36.912
Jack deals with contracts.

42:36.945 --> 42:39.014
Okay, well what's Jack saying?

42:39.047 --> 42:42.050
He's saying they just
replaced me with someone else.

42:42.083 --> 42:43.085
Who?

42:45.186 --> 42:47.122
Some girl called Sophie Allen.

42:49.023 --> 42:50.791
- Who is she, do you know-
- Me neither.

42:50.824 --> 42:52.093
No, I looked her up.

42:52.126 --> 42:56.798
She's some emerging
artist, rising star,

42:57.498 --> 42:58.833
according to the Guardian.

43:00.268 --> 43:01.436
It's obviously bullshit.

43:01.469 --> 43:03.172
It's just complete
Keith Haring rip off.

43:21.255 --> 43:22.190
Or maybe,

43:26.795 --> 43:30.999
maybe it's a sign that
you need to change.

43:33.233 --> 43:34.068
Change what?

43:35.536 --> 43:37.138
Change your style.

43:37.172 --> 43:40.909
Change my style,
change my, yeah, sure.

43:40.942 --> 43:42.043
Fuck it, I'll just
change my style.

43:42.077 --> 43:43.478
It's not like I've worked
hard to get where I am, right?

43:43.510 --> 43:45.780
Henry, I'm not saying that.

43:45.813 --> 43:47.382
Obviously, I know
you've worked so hard.

43:47.414 --> 43:48.784
Then what are you saying, Tess?

43:48.817 --> 43:49.384
Why am I just gonna
change my style of work?

43:49.416 --> 43:50.317
Because you want-

43:50.351 --> 43:51.853
10 years to try and get this.

43:51.885 --> 43:53.054
So what?

43:53.086 --> 43:55.190
I've worked hard, what?
start from scratch.

43:55.222 --> 43:58.092
No, don't start from
scratch but go from here.

43:58.126 --> 43:59.427
I'll work in charcoal now.

43:59.460 --> 44:01.396
No, just move forward, you
want to sell your paintings.

44:01.429 --> 44:03.064
Yeah, of course I want
to sell paintings.

44:03.097 --> 44:06.835
You made it work so maybe
it's time to change slightly.

44:06.867 --> 44:09.170
Just fucking try something new.

44:09.204 --> 44:12.374
Okay, yeah, okay.

44:15.175 --> 44:16.110
Sorry, you're right.

44:16.143 --> 44:19.814
Yeah, maybe, sorry.

44:21.849 --> 44:23.451
It's gonna be okay.

44:23.483 --> 44:25.554
Yeah, yeah.

44:26.221 --> 44:29.157
I'm sorry about the exhibition.

44:29.190 --> 44:32.561
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

44:32.594 --> 44:36.965
How was your, what
did they say at work?

44:36.998 --> 44:39.134
Oh, it was fine, it was nothing.

44:39.166 --> 44:41.002
Yeah, it's all good.

45:30.251 --> 45:34.623
So, how's the painting going?

45:36.224 --> 45:39.528
It's good, good,
good, good, not bad.

45:40.461 --> 45:44.231
Well, don't let the
bastards grind you down.

45:44.264 --> 45:47.001
You've got to be patient.

45:47.034 --> 45:51.672
I mean, look, it took me
10 years to sell anything.

45:51.706 --> 45:54.309
Mind you, Handsome Traveler,

45:54.342 --> 45:56.577
that was a God damn masterpiece.

45:56.610 --> 45:59.614
I was thinking of changing
my style a little bit.

45:59.646 --> 46:02.250
Ooh, what do you
want to do that for?

46:02.282 --> 46:05.219
Well, I'm not exactly
selling loads of paintings.

46:06.521 --> 46:09.190
No, no, no, that's the
worst thing you can do.

46:09.222 --> 46:11.157
It's just giving in to demand.

46:11.159 --> 46:15.329
And that is the graveyard of
all creativity, you know this.

46:15.362 --> 46:18.365
Dad, Dad, I need to
pay my bills, so.

46:18.398 --> 46:20.234
Oh, oh, right.

46:20.268 --> 46:22.304
See that's what's wrong
with your generation.

46:22.336 --> 46:25.306
It's all the buy this, buy
that, travel here, travel there.

46:25.340 --> 46:28.610
What ever happened to
living within one's means?

46:28.643 --> 46:29.543
I live-

46:29.577 --> 46:31.479
You own a house in Islington.

46:31.512 --> 46:36.518
Well, yes, which I bought cash
from earnings 35 years ago.

46:37.985 --> 46:39.288
Congratulations.

46:40.755 --> 46:42.291
Was quite an achievement.

46:43.590 --> 46:48.596
Look, what you need is
to find yourself a muse.

46:50.530 --> 46:52.199
You know, a companion.

46:52.233 --> 46:54.202
It works a treat.

46:54.235 --> 46:55.370
You trust me.

46:55.402 --> 46:59.139
There was this one woman I was
with, Isabella was her name.

46:59.172 --> 47:01.375
- Yeah, I remember.
- Oh no, no, no, no, no.

47:01.409 --> 47:03.177
This was before I
met your mother.

47:03.210 --> 47:04.278
- Honestly.
- Really?

47:04.311 --> 47:08.349
Yeah, now she was one of the
glories of God's creation.

47:08.382 --> 47:12.386
A thing of absolute beauty
and smart as a whip.

47:12.420 --> 47:14.255
Those were the good old days.

47:14.288 --> 47:17.257
I made some of my best work
when I was with Isabella.

47:17.291 --> 47:20.195
Well, I'm actually seeing
someone at the moment, so.

47:20.228 --> 47:23.764
Oh for God's sake, no,
you do not see a woman.

47:23.797 --> 47:26.300
You see a dentist or
a lawyer or a priest.

47:26.333 --> 47:29.703
You are with a woman.

47:29.737 --> 47:31.139
Well, she is a lawyer.

47:33.373 --> 47:37.344
Oh, you have got to be joking.

47:37.378 --> 47:39.014
Have you not been listening
to a word I've said?

47:39.047 --> 47:40.115
Listen, you need
to be with a woman

47:40.148 --> 47:43.550
who will get the best out of
you, who will inspire you,

47:43.583 --> 47:45.652
not remind you of the
terms and conditions

47:45.686 --> 47:47.021
of your tenancy agreement.

47:47.054 --> 47:50.457
Well, she does
actually inspire me.

47:50.490 --> 47:51.726
Oh?

47:51.759 --> 47:56.398
Well, you know, I
am happy for you.

47:56.431 --> 47:58.365
You enjoy it while it lasts.

47:58.398 --> 48:00.300
I mean sooner or later
you're gonna find yourself

48:00.333 --> 48:04.471
just standing in the street
with a handful of ticker tape

48:04.505 --> 48:05.740
blinking in the sunlight.

48:05.773 --> 48:07.375
What the fuck is ticker tape?

48:07.407 --> 48:10.210
Ticker tape, it, it,

48:10.244 --> 48:14.349
look, all relationships
are just a car crash

48:14.382 --> 48:15.583
looking for somewhere to happen.

48:15.615 --> 48:18.519
It's just a matter
of time, believe me.

48:23.190 --> 48:26.227
And what ever
happened to Isabel?

48:27.728 --> 48:31.633
Well, you know, all good
things come to an end.

48:34.469 --> 48:35.771
Thanks for the pep talk.

48:37.405 --> 48:41.076
Well I was afraid you were
gonna ask me for money, but.

48:49.217 --> 48:51.086
Think I might go
home this weekend.

48:53.753 --> 48:54.722
It's a good idea.

49:01.695 --> 49:03.498
I can't believe
this is happening.

49:06.501 --> 49:10.405
I just didn't, didn't ever
think this would happen to me.

49:13.141 --> 49:16.478
Sorry, it's horrible.

49:22.916 --> 49:26.755
There's nothing to say that
she can't get through this.

49:28.523 --> 49:31.226
That's not what the
doctors are saying.

49:31.259 --> 49:33.594
Doctors don't always know
what they're talking about.

49:35.695 --> 49:40.701
My friend, John, when I was
growing up, we were about five.

49:42.436 --> 49:45.140
John's mom got told that she
had a few months to live.

49:46.541 --> 49:47.843
She's still here now.

49:49.643 --> 49:52.413
They don't always know what
they're talking about, Tess.

49:55.449 --> 49:56.851
Do you want me to come with you?

49:56.884 --> 49:59.920
No, I don't think
that'd be a good idea.

49:59.954 --> 50:01.322
I could just be an
extra pair of hands.

50:01.355 --> 50:04.391
Even just helping your dad out.

50:04.425 --> 50:06.461
Clean the house, I
don't know, anything.

50:08.262 --> 50:09.264
Just think about it.

50:18.539 --> 50:23.545
I suppose it would be, yeah,
maybe it would be helpful.

50:28.349 --> 50:30.485
- It's gonna be okay.
- Okay.

50:31.952 --> 50:36.257
Just, just spare
me the optimism.

50:40.228 --> 50:41.762
Just trying to be helpful.

50:41.795 --> 50:43.297
I know, it's just a bit.

50:44.231 --> 50:45.833
Feel like a Christian.

50:57.744 --> 51:00.382
Okay, well I'm here
if you need me.

51:02.516 --> 51:03.552
Thanks.

53:44.545 --> 53:45.613
I just think it'd be bad.

53:45.646 --> 53:46.514
You think, Henry?

53:46.547 --> 53:47.715
Okay, I'm just saying,

53:47.748 --> 53:49.684
it's just like,
don't shut it down.

53:58.793 --> 54:00.995
Are you even following the map?

54:01.027 --> 54:01.862
For fuck's sake.

54:06.199 --> 54:07.968
You've missed the turn,
you've missed the turn.

54:08.001 --> 54:09.737
Well you're meant to be
fucking doing the map Tess?

54:09.769 --> 54:10.972
For fuck's sake.

54:11.005 --> 54:12.006
I'm driving, I don't
know where I'm going.

54:12.039 --> 54:13.608
You can't read the fucking map?

54:13.641 --> 54:15.742
I'm driving, I can't
fucking do it all, alright?

54:15.775 --> 54:16.676
Okay, alright.

54:16.710 --> 54:17.845
Maybe you should fucking drive.

54:17.878 --> 54:19.748
- Okay, yeah, let's go, swap.
- Fine.

55:13.733 --> 55:14.802
Fucking hell.

55:38.291 --> 55:41.762
Okay, slow down, fuck, Tess.

55:45.565 --> 55:46.800
Shut the fuck up, let me drive.

55:46.833 --> 55:48.068
All right, I'm just saying,

55:49.836 --> 55:51.572
I think we were meant
to go back that way.

55:52.940 --> 55:54.909
We were definitely meant
to go back that way.

55:58.978 --> 56:02.049
Just turn, just turn around.

56:41.621 --> 56:42.956
I'm not even asking for
that much, you know,

56:42.989 --> 56:44.525
I'm just saying.

56:46.860 --> 56:48.762
Yeah, but that
wasn't my decision.

56:51.231 --> 56:56.237
Well then, but how, yeah,
no, no, yeah, I actually,

56:57.036 --> 56:58.005
I do understand.

56:59.940 --> 57:02.043
No, I get it, I do
get it, I get it.

57:02.076 --> 57:04.744
I'm just saying, you know,
if not the exhibition

57:04.777 --> 57:08.348
then why can't we just do
something more collaborative with.

57:08.382 --> 57:10.617
Exactly, you know,
more brand stuff.

57:11.719 --> 57:12.554
Like Alex.

57:13.920 --> 57:14.955
Yeah.

57:17.056 --> 57:17.891
Well.

57:20.226 --> 57:22.596
I don't think he
is asking for much.

57:25.065 --> 57:25.900
Well get them.

57:29.168 --> 57:31.873
Well, basically, we're not
just selling any works.

57:34.842 --> 57:35.943
Why is that on me?

57:37.110 --> 57:38.211
Well, how can you get?

57:41.949 --> 57:46.954
Actually, I think I've
seen one of your paintings.

57:47.855 --> 57:48.722
The other day.

57:48.755 --> 57:53.827
It was in a private
hedge fund in Mayfair

57:53.860 --> 57:57.030
hanging in a meeting room.

57:57.063 --> 57:58.264
Was it really?

57:58.297 --> 58:00.967
From your black and
white collection.

58:01.001 --> 58:01.803
Whoa.

58:03.170 --> 58:04.672
You should be proud.

58:06.407 --> 58:08.175
Honestly, I didn't know
that had gone there.

58:08.208 --> 58:09.976
More wine, anyone?

58:10.010 --> 58:11.379
I knew I'd sold one.

58:11.411 --> 58:13.747
I'm all right, I have
quite a lot still.

58:18.052 --> 58:19.019
Claire?

58:19.052 --> 58:21.188
No, actually I'm
at my provision.

58:21.221 --> 58:22.255
What, a big night?

58:22.289 --> 58:25.627
No Tess, but thanks for that.

58:27.126 --> 58:27.961
No.

58:29.762 --> 58:30.730
What?

58:30.764 --> 58:33.701
No, I just, I've got some news.

58:34.867 --> 58:37.070
I told you, I told
you when I saw her.

58:37.103 --> 58:37.938
Eyes up!

58:40.173 --> 58:41.809
I'm not pregnant.

58:44.077 --> 58:44.911
Not yet.

58:45.913 --> 58:50.818
I, yeah, I, me and Mike
decided to start trying so,

58:51.952 --> 58:54.822
and I'm actually
ovulating right now.

58:54.855 --> 58:58.726
So I just don't want
to turn up too drunk,

58:58.759 --> 58:59.827
mess the whole thing up.

58:59.860 --> 59:00.961
- It's a thing.
- No, I know.

59:00.994 --> 59:03.263
It's a thing, it's an app!
There's an app for everything.

59:03.297 --> 59:05.965
Literally, - There's an app.

59:05.998 --> 59:07.901
Well congratulations,
that's exciting.

59:10.170 --> 59:14.041
- Cheers to that.
- Cheers to ovaries.

59:14.074 --> 59:16.976
- Cheers.
- A new human.

59:18.878 --> 59:20.181
That was weird phrasing.

59:20.947 --> 59:24.018
Would you know if
this would be a boy

59:24.050 --> 59:27.420
or if it was a girl, sorry?

59:27.454 --> 59:30.124
No, you would not know.

59:30.157 --> 59:32.093
It's not like you pay extra
and you get to decide.

59:32.126 --> 59:36.063
Well, Mike obviously
wants a boy and I,

59:36.096 --> 59:39.467
you know, I want a
little girl, so yeah.

59:39.500 --> 59:41.135
- Well we'll have to see.
- We'll see.

59:41.168 --> 59:45.072
- Well 50-50, flip a coin.
- Flip a coin, exactly.

59:45.105 --> 59:46.074
Just like that.

59:51.177 --> 59:52.179
What about you guys?

59:52.213 --> 59:55.416
Have you ever thought about
having kids, children?

59:55.449 --> 59:56.751
- No.
- No.

59:56.784 --> 59:59.019
No?

59:59.052 --> 01:00:00.221
That is not
something that we've-

01:00:00.253 --> 01:00:01.389
That's never come up.

01:00:02.789 --> 01:00:05.992
I think you guys would
make amazing parents.

01:00:06.025 --> 01:00:07.127
Yeah, I don't know.

01:00:07.161 --> 01:00:08.463
I don't feel like.

01:00:11.965 --> 01:00:15.236
It kind of takes two, but no,
I don't think, I'm not ready.

01:00:15.268 --> 01:00:16.936
I don't think you're ready.

01:00:16.969 --> 01:00:18.004
What's that supposed to mean?

01:00:18.038 --> 01:00:19.005
It takes two.

01:00:20.239 --> 01:00:21.108
To make a baby?

01:00:24.177 --> 01:00:26.112
Actually now we
don't really need.

01:00:26.146 --> 01:00:28.883
Yeah, exactly, exactly,
with advancements.

01:00:28.916 --> 01:00:30.851
Just download the app.

01:00:30.884 --> 01:00:33.954
The ovulation and
whenever you're ready.

01:00:35.021 --> 01:00:35.856
Get a donor

01:00:36.824 --> 01:00:37.458
Yeah.

01:00:38.826 --> 01:00:41.094
Henry, are you still
doing music or anything?

01:00:43.496 --> 01:00:44.865
- A little bit.
- Yeah?

01:00:45.599 --> 01:00:47.134
Messing around.

01:00:47.166 --> 01:00:49.237
Anything you're
doing at the moment?

01:00:50.271 --> 01:00:52.173
I've always got a few little
bits and bobs going on.

01:00:52.206 --> 01:00:56.043
It's not like a... it's like
a little hobby, I suppose.

01:00:56.076 --> 01:00:57.244
Go on, show us.

01:00:58.110 --> 01:00:59.112
Play some.

01:01:00.012 --> 01:01:01.148
Go on, it'll be fun.

01:01:01.181 --> 01:01:02.416
No, it would be a
really nice thing to do.

01:01:02.449 --> 01:01:03.284
We're having dinner.

01:01:05.351 --> 01:01:08.254
Yeah, let's, you know, share.

01:01:08.288 --> 01:01:09.389
- Really?
- Yeah!

01:01:09.422 --> 01:01:10.456
Alright.

01:01:10.489 --> 01:01:12.359

Have a lovely trip back.

01:04:02.028 --> 01:04:04.065
Hey man, I'll see you in a week.

01:04:05.231 --> 01:04:06.067
Cool, man.

01:04:12.204 --> 01:04:14.976
You tore my
heart out with that song.

01:04:17.077 --> 01:04:19.313
We'll learn the
lyrics for next time.

01:04:19.346 --> 01:04:21.048
Four part harmonies.

01:04:31.458 --> 01:04:33.160
See ya, drive safe.

01:04:34.494 --> 01:04:35.329
- Bye.
- Bye.

01:04:39.365 --> 01:04:40.467
Bye.

01:05:37.289 --> 01:05:39.592
I think it's good they came.

01:06:37.751 --> 01:06:40.454
- Fuck.
- Are you asleep?

01:06:40.487 --> 01:06:41.722
Obviously I'm asleep, why are...

01:06:41.755 --> 01:06:44.224
You literally just went
to bed five minutes ago.

01:06:44.257 --> 01:06:46.793
Why are you putting
the light on?

01:06:46.826 --> 01:06:49.295
I couldn't find
my phone charger.

01:06:49.329 --> 01:06:50.498
Well can you turn it off?

01:06:52.766 --> 01:06:54.501
Tess, turn the light off.

01:07:00.773 --> 01:07:01.541
Okay.

01:07:04.710 --> 01:07:07.446
- Alright, just, alright-
- Don't start like that.

01:07:07.480 --> 01:07:09.315
- Just tell me what-
- Why did you go to bed?

01:07:09.349 --> 01:07:10.284
Just tell me what I did.

01:07:10.317 --> 01:07:11.617
What, is this what it is?

01:07:11.650 --> 01:07:13.219
I just want you to tell
me what I've done wrong

01:07:13.253 --> 01:07:14.588
and then I can just deal with it

01:07:14.621 --> 01:07:16.389
and we can turn the light off.

01:07:16.422 --> 01:07:17.623
What did I do?

01:07:17.657 --> 01:07:19.626
What? I didn't do
all the washing up?

01:07:19.659 --> 01:07:20.561
They're your friends.

01:07:20.594 --> 01:07:21.360
Why didn't you stay down there?

01:07:21.393 --> 01:07:22.395
They're my friends?

01:07:22.429 --> 01:07:23.363
We were having people to dinner.

01:07:23.396 --> 01:07:25.532
I did enough.

01:07:25.565 --> 01:07:26.398
You did enough?

01:07:26.432 --> 01:07:28.768
You played a fucking
song, a stupid song.

01:07:28.802 --> 01:07:30.570
Oh my God.

01:07:30.603 --> 01:07:32.605
Yeah, I played a song.

01:07:32.639 --> 01:07:33.941
They asked me to
play a song, sorry.

01:07:36.443 --> 01:07:37.645
It's not about a song.

01:07:38.644 --> 01:07:42.615
Well, turn the light off then.

01:07:46.286 --> 01:07:47.588
Can you even read music?

01:07:49.655 --> 01:07:52.326
No, no, I can't read music.

01:07:52.358 --> 01:07:53.594
You know I can't read music.

01:07:53.626 --> 01:07:54.827
John Lennon couldn't
fucking read music.

01:07:54.860 --> 01:07:56.362
John Lennon?

01:07:56.396 --> 01:07:57.531
Yeah, John Lennon
couldn't read music.

01:07:57.563 --> 01:07:59.298
Are you comparing
yourself to John Lennon?

01:07:59.331 --> 01:08:00.333
Yeah, comparing myself-

01:08:00.367 --> 01:08:01.368
Jesus fucking Christ.

01:08:01.402 --> 01:08:03.237
Of course I'm not comparing
myself to John Lennon.

01:08:03.269 --> 01:08:05.639
I'm just making the fucking
point that he can't read music.

01:08:08.608 --> 01:08:12.579
Why does everything have to
be so fucking square with you?

01:08:12.612 --> 01:08:13.512
Can't read music, no-

01:08:13.545 --> 01:08:16.550
Square, don't call me square.

01:08:16.582 --> 01:08:17.951
Doesn't matter.

01:08:17.984 --> 01:08:20.487
What is your problem?

01:08:20.520 --> 01:08:22.389
I sang a song, your
friends liked it.

01:08:22.421 --> 01:08:23.589
You humiliated me tonight.

01:08:23.622 --> 01:08:25.390
Oh my God, dramatic.

01:08:26.725 --> 01:08:29.563
- Humiliated you?
- Yes.

01:08:29.595 --> 01:08:31.596
What, 'cause I played a song?

01:08:31.631 --> 01:08:34.600
- No, at fucking dinner.
- What?

01:08:36.603 --> 01:08:39.404
When Claire asked if we'd
thought about having kids.

01:08:41.841 --> 01:08:42.743
Yeah?

01:08:42.774 --> 01:08:43.809
You were like, no, it takes two.

01:08:43.841 --> 01:08:45.479
Like what, what does that mean?

01:08:45.511 --> 01:08:47.680
What do you think
they're gonna think?

01:08:47.712 --> 01:08:48.649
It's so embarrassing.

01:08:48.680 --> 01:08:50.483
What do you think it means?

01:08:51.551 --> 01:08:53.319
She was talking about her
ovaries, for fuck's sake.

01:08:53.353 --> 01:08:54.688
I don't care.

01:08:54.720 --> 01:08:57.290
You know that I'm
a private person.

01:08:57.323 --> 01:08:59.658
Don't do that in front
of my friends, okay?

01:08:59.693 --> 01:09:02.328
Maybe if it wasn't
true, I wouldn't say it.

01:09:05.698 --> 01:09:06.799
It does take two.

01:09:16.676 --> 01:09:17.577
You gonna get the light?

01:09:17.609 --> 01:09:18.711
Can you turn the light off?

01:09:18.743 --> 01:09:20.412
I've got an early morning.

01:09:20.447 --> 01:09:21.613
Have to go to work.

01:13:27.993 --> 01:13:28.895
I can't breathe.

01:13:35.801 --> 01:13:36.636
Okay.

01:14:30.355 --> 01:14:32.291
♪ We can live on the mountain ♪

01:14:32.324 --> 01:14:35.929
♪ Like living in the sunset ♪

01:14:35.962 --> 01:14:40.968
♪ We can live on this, true ♪

01:14:43.036 --> 01:14:46.905
♪ We can live on the mountain ♪

01:14:46.939 --> 01:14:50.744
♪ Like living in the sunset ♪

01:14:50.777 --> 01:14:54.948
♪ I wanna live on
the mountain, blue ♪

01:15:18.871 --> 01:15:21.207
Henry, people work to live.

01:15:21.239 --> 01:15:23.710
Like it's not the
case for everyone

01:15:23.743 --> 01:15:28.081
but that is what people
have to do in life.

01:15:28.113 --> 01:15:33.119
So for you to literally refuse
to do anything different,

01:15:33.854 --> 01:15:35.288
anything, make
any changes at all

01:15:35.320 --> 01:15:37.923
just to make a living,
to have some success,

01:15:37.957 --> 01:15:40.093
to provide something
for this house,

01:15:41.027 --> 01:15:44.197
I genuinely don't understand.

01:15:44.229 --> 01:15:46.866
I really want you
to explain to me.

01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:48.967
This is a genuine question.

01:15:49.001 --> 01:15:49.836
Alright, yeah.

01:15:56.141 --> 01:15:57.877
Well I don't know what
you want me to say?

01:16:02.114 --> 01:16:05.184
How many times do I have
to say in that same way?

01:16:05.217 --> 01:16:07.019
I can't think of
another way to say it

01:16:07.052 --> 01:16:07.854
is I'm a fucking artist.

01:16:07.886 --> 01:16:08.954
Explain it to me again.

01:16:08.988 --> 01:16:09.789
Okay, I'm an artist.

01:16:09.822 --> 01:16:10.724
- Yeah.
- Right?

01:16:10.756 --> 01:16:11.790
- Mm-hmm.
- I make art.

01:16:11.823 --> 01:16:13.025
- Yeah.
- That's what I do.

01:16:13.059 --> 01:16:13.993
Why can't you try and
make art that sells?

01:16:14.025 --> 01:16:16.061
Art isn't commerce, okay?

01:16:16.095 --> 01:16:18.264
Art is a feeling, it
comes from within.

01:16:18.296 --> 01:16:21.433
I'm not just gonna like
follow the pound signs

01:16:21.466 --> 01:16:23.001
'cause you can't do that.

01:16:23.034 --> 01:16:24.871
There's no fucking formula.

01:16:24.904 --> 01:16:27.240
There's no calculations that
you can make to make art.

01:16:27.273 --> 01:16:28.942
It doesn't work like that.

01:16:28.975 --> 01:16:30.810
Where would you be living
if we weren't together?

01:16:30.842 --> 01:16:34.079
You need to make money to
live, you're a fucking adult.

01:16:34.113 --> 01:16:37.050
I know, but it just can fucking
happened like that, Tess.

01:16:37.082 --> 01:16:37.916
You don't know what's
around the corner.

01:16:37.951 --> 01:16:40.252
Okay, so how long are
you gonna give it?

01:16:41.921 --> 01:16:43.289
How long?

01:16:43.322 --> 01:16:45.225
When I'm done,
when I'm finished.

01:16:45.257 --> 01:16:48.894
- When you're done, okay.
- I can't not do this.

01:16:48.927 --> 01:16:49.528
Do you understand?

01:16:49.561 --> 01:16:50.963
I can't not do it.

01:16:50.997 --> 01:16:53.800
So do you want me
to keep working

01:16:53.832 --> 01:16:57.170
and paying our rent
and paying for our food

01:16:57.203 --> 01:16:58.538
and paying for
everything that we need?

01:16:58.570 --> 01:17:00.006
Are you okay with that?

01:17:00.038 --> 01:17:01.108
- Yeah, yeah.
- Yeah?

01:17:02.240 --> 01:17:03.208
Okay.

01:17:03.242 --> 01:17:04.144
Don't make out that you
buy everything as well.

01:17:04.176 --> 01:17:05.210
I buy stuff.

01:17:05.243 --> 01:17:06.479
What do you buy, Henry?

01:17:09.215 --> 01:17:11.217
That chair.

01:17:11.250 --> 01:17:13.286
- That chair?
- Yeah.

01:17:13.319 --> 01:17:15.121
You bought that
chair from Johnny

01:17:15.154 --> 01:17:17.791
when you helped him move
flat, he gave it to you.

01:17:17.823 --> 01:17:18.924
You didn't fucking
buy that chair.

01:17:18.957 --> 01:17:20.225
Yeah, but I got the chair.

01:17:20.259 --> 01:17:22.194
Why does it matter
if I pay with it?

01:17:22.228 --> 01:17:25.198
Because the point is you
haven't paid for anything

01:17:25.230 --> 01:17:28.534
in the last two years and I'm
fucking sick of it, sorry.

01:17:30.837 --> 01:17:33.140
I'm gonna, I'm just gonna
go out for a bit, okay?

01:17:45.150 --> 01:17:46.952
You seen
my yellow jumper?

01:17:51.256 --> 01:17:53.225
Yo, Tess, have you
seen my yellow jumper?

01:17:53.259 --> 01:17:54.094
No.

01:17:56.194 --> 01:17:57.363
It's not in the drawer.

01:18:03.002 --> 01:18:04.571
Do you know the one
I'm talking about?

01:18:04.604 --> 01:18:05.972
The woolen one I
got in Scotland.

01:18:06.005 --> 01:18:08.275
Yes, I think I saw
it by the front door.

01:18:09.475 --> 01:18:11.278
Why is it
by the front door?

01:18:13.279 --> 01:18:14.180
Did you wear it?

01:18:14.212 --> 01:18:16.248
I don't care, who cares, maybe,

01:18:16.282 --> 01:18:18.251
but have you looked
by the front door?

01:18:18.283 --> 01:18:19.518
I'm gonna look now.

01:18:24.023 --> 01:18:25.192
It's not by the front door.

01:18:26.458 --> 01:18:28.094
Not in the laundry,
it's not in the drawer.

01:18:28.127 --> 01:18:29.462
Yeah, I don't know.

01:18:29.494 --> 01:18:30.896
Henry, I'm just trying to read,

01:18:30.930 --> 01:18:32.097
I'm just taking
a moment to read.

01:18:32.131 --> 01:18:33.298
Can you just
find it, please?

01:18:33.332 --> 01:18:34.567
No, I'm not gonna
fucking find your jumper.

01:18:34.600 --> 01:18:36.202
What are you
pretending to read?

01:18:36.234 --> 01:18:37.903
What is that, is that a book?

01:18:38.637 --> 01:18:41.908
Wow, there's a change.

01:18:41.940 --> 01:18:44.476
I'm trying to read.

01:18:44.510 --> 01:18:45.578
I know you're trying.

01:18:45.610 --> 01:18:46.445
What is it, a picture book?

01:18:46.479 --> 01:18:48.347
Shut the fuck up.

01:18:51.250 --> 01:18:54.287
Joking, a bit touchy.

01:18:54.319 --> 01:18:57.189
- Normally you're just-
- Get the fuck out!

01:19:16.475 --> 01:19:18.344
It was in the drawer.

01:19:18.377 --> 01:19:20.614
I looked in the wrong one.

01:19:26.319 --> 01:19:27.220
Fuck's sake.

01:19:29.721 --> 01:19:31.323
Do you want another one?

01:19:35.493 --> 01:19:38.130
I've got an early
start tomorrow.

01:19:38.163 --> 01:19:39.899
I probably shouldn't.

01:19:40.733 --> 01:19:43.136
Gotta get home to Harry.

01:19:43.168 --> 01:19:44.170
- Henry.
- Henry.

01:19:44.203 --> 01:19:46.105
You know his name is Henry.

01:19:46.137 --> 01:19:50.277
- Henry, sorry.
- Yeah, he's at home.

01:19:52.645 --> 01:19:53.513
How's it going?

01:19:56.349 --> 01:19:57.250
It's going.

01:20:00.185 --> 01:20:02.588
I think that we're definitely
gonna have two more.

01:20:03.488 --> 01:20:04.990
Can I get two more please?

01:20:07.193 --> 01:20:09.262
Are you looking forward Kiev?

01:20:09.295 --> 01:20:11.230
No, not at all.

01:20:11.262 --> 01:20:13.332
It is going to be the most-

01:20:13.365 --> 01:20:14.367
- Boring?
- Boring.

01:20:14.399 --> 01:20:15.534
It's a good career though.

01:20:16.668 --> 01:20:17.503
Yeah, okay.

01:20:18.436 --> 01:20:19.738
- Yeah, okay.
- No?

01:20:19.771 --> 01:20:22.307
- Well.
- Sarah is there.

01:20:22.341 --> 01:20:23.242
And Jared.

01:20:23.274 --> 01:20:24.576
Yeah, but I can guarantee you

01:20:24.609 --> 01:20:26.378
that I won't see either of them.

01:20:26.412 --> 01:20:27.280
Yeah, that's true.

01:20:27.313 --> 01:20:29.516
Oh, have you heard
about the big surprise?

01:20:30.448 --> 01:20:31.583
- No.
- Anderson.

01:20:32.518 --> 01:20:33.686
He's gonna make a speech.

01:20:34.354 --> 01:20:37.256
How the fuck did he manage that?

01:20:37.288 --> 01:20:39.458
No idea, I have no idea.

01:20:41.659 --> 01:20:42.461
Toast?

01:20:44.563 --> 01:20:48.301
To be fair, last year
when I went it was awful,

01:20:48.333 --> 01:20:49.702
but the final night is amazing.

01:20:49.734 --> 01:20:51.336
- Really?
- Yeah.

01:20:51.369 --> 01:20:53.072
So what am I doing, just
living for the weekend?

01:20:53.104 --> 01:20:54.673
Live for the weekend,
get through it

01:20:54.707 --> 01:20:56.242
You'll have a good time.

01:20:58.144 --> 01:21:01.681
Good, I'll take a, I'll take
that and hope for the best.

01:21:01.713 --> 01:21:04.050
I wish I was going with you.

01:21:04.082 --> 01:21:06.418
Actually you should, why not?

01:21:06.452 --> 01:21:09.255
- No, I've done it once.
- Come on.

01:21:12.257 --> 01:21:13.158
Thank you.

01:21:13.193 --> 01:21:16.096
So you're just leaving
me to the lion's den?

01:21:18.064 --> 01:21:19.499
You'll survive.

01:21:26.538 --> 01:21:29.376
- So.
- So.

01:22:39.545 --> 01:22:41.213
Why are you up late?

01:22:44.582 --> 01:22:46.284
Where have you been?

01:22:46.318 --> 01:22:49.622
I told you, I was having drinks.

01:22:49.654 --> 01:22:51.323
- No you didn't.
- After work drinks.

01:22:51.356 --> 01:22:54.194
- Yeah, I did, I told you.
- No, you didn't.

01:22:55.360 --> 01:22:56.628
I've been trying to call you,

01:22:56.662 --> 01:22:57.463
why aren't you
checking your phone?

01:22:57.496 --> 01:22:58.698
What?

01:22:58.730 --> 01:22:59.664
I said I've been
trying to call you.

01:22:59.698 --> 01:23:02.502
Well, my phone died ages ago.

01:23:02.534 --> 01:23:05.238
I told you, stop
looking at me like that.

01:23:05.270 --> 01:23:06.238
You didn't tell me which is why

01:23:06.271 --> 01:23:07.405
I fucking cooked
us dinner, Tess.

01:23:07.439 --> 01:23:09.742
You don't fucking cook, Henry.

01:23:09.774 --> 01:23:12.777
It's in the bin if you
want to get it out.

01:23:12.810 --> 01:23:14.613
I'm sorry.

01:23:16.414 --> 01:23:17.250
Sure.

01:23:25.390 --> 01:23:26.625
Where were you?

01:23:26.658 --> 01:23:29.461
I just told you I was
having drinks after work.

01:23:29.494 --> 01:23:30.829
Yeah, I can see you
were having drinks.

01:23:30.863 --> 01:23:32.298
What is that supposed to mean?

01:23:32.331 --> 01:23:34.234
Well, your eyes are
like fucking wonky.

01:23:35.600 --> 01:23:38.436
Yeah, well when you drink,
you get a bit drunk.

01:23:38.470 --> 01:23:41.541
So that's just
what happens, yeah.

01:23:44.275 --> 01:23:46.479
Oh my God, you're an
absolute fucking mess.

01:23:46.511 --> 01:23:47.612
Sorry?

01:23:47.645 --> 01:23:48.547
I said you're a mess, Tess.

01:23:48.581 --> 01:23:50.483
Shut the fuck up.

01:23:50.515 --> 01:23:51.550
Stop judging me.

01:23:51.583 --> 01:23:53.452
I fucking worked all week.

01:23:53.484 --> 01:23:55.320
I'm allowed to have a
few drinks after work.

01:23:55.354 --> 01:23:57.256
Yeah, maybe just tell
me in the future.

01:23:57.288 --> 01:23:58.757
I did tell you, Henry.

01:23:58.791 --> 01:24:00.426
If you listened, maybe-

01:24:00.458 --> 01:24:03.328
What were you doing, just
drinks, colleagues, networking,

01:24:03.362 --> 01:24:07.533
talking business, really
interesting lawyer stuff?

01:24:07.565 --> 01:24:11.536
Yeah, I'm so boring, I'm so
fucking boring, fuck you.

01:24:11.569 --> 01:24:12.837
You just sit at home
all day doing nothing.

01:24:12.871 --> 01:24:14.507
You're a lazy piece of shit.

01:24:14.539 --> 01:24:15.408
Yeah, that's what
I've been doing.

01:24:15.440 --> 01:24:19.612
Yeah, what does playing
the somber music.

01:24:19.645 --> 01:24:21.514
Like go out, get
some fucking air.

01:24:21.546 --> 01:24:22.447
Oh my God.

01:24:22.480 --> 01:24:23.615
Meet people, have a drink.

01:24:23.649 --> 01:24:24.450
I've been out,
thank you very much.

01:24:24.483 --> 01:24:26.953
- I've been out.
- I'm getting a drink.

01:24:26.985 --> 01:24:29.521
Don't get a drink, you're
fucking pissed, Tess.

01:24:29.555 --> 01:24:30.823
You don't need a drink.

01:24:30.855 --> 01:24:32.524
I'll get a drink
if I want a fucking drink.

01:24:32.557 --> 01:24:33.326
Alright, tell you
what, I'll get you a drink.

01:24:33.359 --> 01:24:34.860
Get off me!

01:24:42.533 --> 01:24:45.404
What the fuck is wrong with you?

01:24:48.841 --> 01:24:49.842
Fuck's sake.

01:24:51.510 --> 01:24:52.545
I just wanna know where the
fuck you were, to be honest.

01:24:52.578 --> 01:24:54.447
That's all I wanna know
and you haven't told me yet

01:24:54.479 --> 01:24:57.282
so you're making me feel like
maybe something's going on

01:24:57.315 --> 01:24:59.318
because I didn't know
about these drinks.

01:24:59.350 --> 01:25:00.987
Something's going on?

01:25:01.020 --> 01:25:02.588
- Yeah, where were you?
- Do you not trust me?

01:25:02.621 --> 01:25:04.690
- No, actually, I don't.
- You don't trust me?

01:25:04.722 --> 01:25:05.725
No, because you ain't telling me

01:25:05.757 --> 01:25:06.925
where the fuck you
are these days.

01:25:06.958 --> 01:25:09.694
I was out for drinks
with my friend Richard.

01:25:09.728 --> 01:25:12.632
See, oh, there it
is, with Richard.

01:25:12.664 --> 01:25:14.000
- Yeah.
- Yeah, Richard.

01:25:14.033 --> 01:25:15.568
- Yeah.
- Yeah, fucking great.

01:25:15.600 --> 01:25:17.336
He tried to kiss me.

01:25:18.636 --> 01:25:20.038
I didn't let him.

01:25:21.907 --> 01:25:23.275
Are you fucking laughing at me?

01:25:23.309 --> 01:25:23.943
Yeah.

01:25:24.877 --> 01:25:25.878
I don't know if you're fucking-

01:25:25.911 --> 01:25:27.546
Fuck you!

01:25:27.578 --> 01:25:29.614
I don't know if you're
telling the truth anymore

01:25:29.648 --> 01:25:32.719
or if you're just absolutely
fucking bullshitting me.

01:25:33.585 --> 01:25:34.787
I don't know.

01:25:34.819 --> 01:25:36.554
I don't know if you're
telling me the truth

01:25:36.587 --> 01:25:37.622
and that's the problem.

01:25:37.655 --> 01:25:39.324
I think you're probably lying.

01:25:39.358 --> 01:25:39.958
You think I'm lying?

01:25:39.992 --> 01:25:41.427
Yeah, tell me the truth.

01:25:41.460 --> 01:25:43.496
- He tried to kiss me.
- And what did you do?

01:25:43.529 --> 01:25:44.563
- I fucking-
- Tell me what you did.

01:25:44.595 --> 01:25:46.731
I fucking slapped him.

01:25:46.765 --> 01:25:47.967
But I wanted to kiss him.

01:25:50.336 --> 01:25:51.271
You fucking.

01:25:53.771 --> 01:25:55.742
Where's
the fucking vodka?

01:25:59.444 --> 01:26:01.947
Just talk to me, Tess!

01:26:01.979 --> 01:26:03.948
- Talk to me!
- What do you want?

01:26:03.981 --> 01:26:07.552
I wanna know why you
wanted to kiss him.

01:26:07.586 --> 01:26:09.622
Why don't you like me, Tess?

01:26:09.654 --> 01:26:12.625
Why can't you just
say you don't like me?

01:26:12.658 --> 01:26:15.428
Instead of going out and
getting fucking pissed?

01:26:15.461 --> 01:26:16.896
Kissing guys, what the fuck?

01:26:16.929 --> 01:26:18.064
I didn't kiss him!

01:26:18.096 --> 01:26:20.632
What the fuck, bullshit,
bull-fucking-shit!

01:26:20.666 --> 01:26:21.667
Fuck you, fuck you!

01:26:21.699 --> 01:26:23.368
I'm going
to fucking bed.

01:26:23.402 --> 01:26:24.636
Fuck you, Henry!

01:26:24.670 --> 01:26:26.572
Clean that fucking
shit up, clean it up!

01:26:26.604 --> 01:26:30.408
- Mess, you're a mess!
- I fucking hate you.

01:26:30.442 --> 01:26:32.712
- I hate you.
- Yeah, I know!

01:26:39.851 --> 01:26:41.653
I fucking hate you!

01:27:43.881 --> 01:27:45.817
How's the hangover?

01:27:57.895 --> 01:27:58.730
Nothing?

01:28:05.537 --> 01:28:10.543
No shame, no sorry,

01:28:10.943 --> 01:28:12.912
