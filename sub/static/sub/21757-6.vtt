26:24.600 --> 26:26.100
and now it's just gone.

26:26.100 --> 26:28.100
- Hey, deck guys,

26:28.100 --> 26:29.767
the guests are gonna take
the tender to the dock,

26:29.767 --> 26:31.633
so you got 20 minutes.

26:31.633 --> 26:33.600
- Oh, man,
this morning was so close.

26:33.600 --> 26:35.500
- That was f---ed.

26:35.500 --> 26:37.633
- Nico's supposed to be
the lead of these guys.

26:37.633 --> 26:39.233
He's not in it to win it.

26:39.233 --> 26:40.633
Something needs to change.

26:40.633 --> 26:42.500
- Really making a name
for ourselves.

26:42.500 --> 26:44.100
- Sure we want to pack it up?

26:44.100 --> 26:45.633
- Get those bags on it.

26:45.633 --> 26:47.300
- Wow.

26:49.233 --> 26:50.500
- What's her name?

26:50.500 --> 26:52.433
- Melissa, Dan, Summer, Matt.

26:52.433 --> 26:54.700
- Melissa, Dan?
- Yeah, and that's Summer.

26:54.700 --> 26:56.433
- Thank you,
my card dealer extraordinaire.

26:56.433 --> 26:58.066
- Captain,
I really appreciate it.

26:58.066 --> 26:59.100
- It's been a pleasure.

26:59.100 --> 27:01.166
[people talking at once]

27:01.166 --> 27:03.000
- Good-bye.
Sir.

27:03.000 --> 27:04.266
Thank you so much
for having us.

27:04.266 --> 27:05.633
Poker night was awesome.

27:05.633 --> 27:07.600
And Chef Matt, you nailed it.

27:07.600 --> 27:09.233
And this is one of the
highlight trips of our marriage

27:09.233 --> 27:10.667
and of my life.

27:10.667 --> 27:12.266
Sir, thank you.
This is for all y'all.

27:12.266 --> 27:13.600
- Have a safe trip home.
- Yes, sir.

27:13.600 --> 27:15.467
- Bye!
- Thank you.

27:15.467 --> 27:17.333
- Despite all that happened
this charter,

27:17.333 --> 27:19.000
I think the guests actually
did have a good time.

27:19.000 --> 27:20.400
Bye, guys.

27:20.400 --> 27:22.000
For starters, I mean,
they didn't die.

27:22.000 --> 27:23.400
- Thank you!
- Bye!

27:23.400 --> 27:24.667
- The good-byes are over.

27:24.667 --> 27:26.000
Let's get up there
and go to work.

27:26.000 --> 27:27.133
- I'm gonna go change...

27:27.133 --> 27:28.500
careers.

27:33.667 --> 27:35.533
- How are you?
- I'm good.

27:35.533 --> 27:37.266
Really, good thanks. I'm
just done with this charter.

27:37.266 --> 27:38.667
There are only four guests,

27:38.667 --> 27:40.333
but it felt like
there were, like, ten.

27:40.333 --> 27:41.600
- But it was good.
You did a good job.

27:41.600 --> 27:43.333
- You too.
You killed it.

27:43.333 --> 27:46.166
- All crew,
in the crew mess now.

27:46.166 --> 27:48.100
- Copy.

27:51.000 --> 27:52.700
- There's not quite
as much room here.

27:52.700 --> 27:55.233
It's like we added somebody.

27:55.233 --> 27:56.300
- [laughs]

27:57.533 --> 27:59.300
- [laughs]
Sorry.

27:59.300 --> 28:02.000
- Hi.
- Hello, everyone.

28:02.000 --> 28:04.166
This charter is a first
for me.

28:04.166 --> 28:06.233
Sober people, I--they're--
it's kind of--

28:06.233 --> 28:08.300
- It was hard to tell if they
were having a good time.

28:08.300 --> 28:11.300
- They left
what appeared to be happy.

28:11.300 --> 28:13.700
They were happier
than I was,

28:13.700 --> 28:16.133
which I'll go into later.

28:16.133 --> 28:17.700
EJ's gonna be hanging out
with us

28:17.700 --> 28:19.166
for the foreseeable future.

28:19.166 --> 28:20.433
We're fortunate
to have him.

28:20.433 --> 28:21.533
- No worries.

28:21.533 --> 28:23.033
I got one stripe.

28:23.033 --> 28:24.533
I'm gonna go back
to polishing.

28:24.533 --> 28:28.300
- Tip-wise, we ended up
with $21,000.

28:28.300 --> 28:31.567
It's $1,750.
- Dang.

28:31.567 --> 28:34.066
- Not bad for people
that don't drink.

28:34.066 --> 28:35.600
- Thank you...
- Very much, sir.

28:35.600 --> 28:38.166
- Captain.
Might be sleeping in the bilge,

28:38.166 --> 28:39.567
like this airless storage
locker,

28:39.567 --> 28:41.200
but we took $21,000.

28:41.200 --> 28:42.300
Like, pretty huge.

28:42.300 --> 28:44.200
So that'll be fine.

28:44.200 --> 28:46.734
- We're gonna be spending
the night on the hook here.

28:46.734 --> 28:48.333
You guys can go
into St. Barts.

28:48.333 --> 28:50.200
Take your money with you.

28:50.200 --> 28:51.600
If you're getting drunk here,
it's gonna cost you.

28:51.600 --> 28:54.066
- You're the--
- Pay attention.

28:54.066 --> 28:55.333
Are you gonna pay attention,
Baker?

28:55.333 --> 28:56.700
- Sorry.
- Okay.

28:56.700 --> 28:58.200
Tomorrow's turnover day,

28:58.200 --> 28:59.734
so let your conscious be
your guide.

28:59.734 --> 29:02.266
I will have no mercy
on you assholes in the morning.

29:02.266 --> 29:03.333
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

29:03.333 --> 29:05.066
- Thanks.

29:09.433 --> 29:11.166
- I'm gonna be organizing
my room.

29:11.166 --> 29:13.166
- I'm relieved,
because I was thinking

29:13.166 --> 29:14.633
that maybe you were gonna get
the boot,

29:14.633 --> 29:16.633
but looks like you're here
to stay, so...

29:16.633 --> 29:18.433
- I think should someone
should get phased out.

29:18.433 --> 29:20.100
Either that, or we should
just get more crew.

29:20.100 --> 29:22.367
Why stop with EJ?
Let's get another one.

29:22.367 --> 29:24.166
- I need all the deck crew

29:24.166 --> 29:25.700
up in the wheelhouse now.

29:25.700 --> 29:27.166
- Roger.

29:31.633 --> 29:35.166
- That anchor drop we did today
was f---ing embarrassing,

29:35.166 --> 29:39.233
and I should put a f---ing bag
over my goddamn head.

29:39.233 --> 29:43.500
Nico, EJ,
we're four charters in.

29:43.500 --> 29:46.633
It can't happen.

29:46.633 --> 29:48.300
Baker, I don't know
what happens to you

29:48.300 --> 29:49.633
when the pressure comes on,

29:49.633 --> 29:51.233
but it seems like
everything you learned

29:51.233 --> 29:54.233
just, like,
gets forgotten.

29:54.233 --> 29:57.400
And Chris, you can't
just sit there and go,

29:57.400 --> 30:01.000
"Oh, hell, sh--,
that boat's gonna hit us"

30:01.000 --> 30:04.000
and stand there
and watch it happen.

30:04.000 --> 30:05.734
The reason
I called you up here--

30:05.734 --> 30:08.433
I'm gonna have to make
a change.

30:10.133 --> 30:11.400
- You don't have the balls
to tell me to my face.

30:11.400 --> 30:13.133
- You're quite bitter
all the time.

30:13.133 --> 30:15.000
- I have nothing to be--
- Listen to me right now.

30:15.000 --> 30:18.300
Jen, Jen, you need
to take it down.

30:21.000 --> 30:21.333
- I'm gonna have to make

30:21.333 --> 30:21.467
- I'm gonna have to make
a change.

30:23.400 --> 30:25.266
I guaranteed you
we will not have a repeat

30:25.266 --> 30:28.133
of what transpired today.

30:28.133 --> 30:29.533
Nico and Chris,
don't run away.

30:29.533 --> 30:31.033
We're not done yet.

30:31.033 --> 30:32.567
The rest of you,
get out of here.

30:32.567 --> 30:35.200
- Ooh, principal's office.

30:39.567 --> 30:42.033
- Chris, in the middle
of a busy charter season,

30:42.033 --> 30:44.667
I don't have the luxury
of being able to teach you

30:44.667 --> 30:46.166
everything that you're
gonna need to know

30:46.166 --> 30:48.000
to make it work
on this boat.

30:48.000 --> 30:49.700
It's not your fault you got
thrust into this position,

30:49.700 --> 30:52.500
but I still have a boat
to run,

30:52.500 --> 30:57.367
and that's just
a cold, hard fact.

30:57.367 --> 30:59.700
I'm gonna have
to cut you loose.

30:59.700 --> 31:01.767
- Cool.

31:01.767 --> 31:04.166
- Come on, now.
It's not cool.

31:04.166 --> 31:06.667
You know, while I believe your
heart's in the right place,

31:06.667 --> 31:10.400
I just need more than you're
capable of giving me right now.

31:10.400 --> 31:13.033
I can't fire everybody
and start over,

31:13.033 --> 31:14.333
but it's time for Chris to go.

31:14.333 --> 31:15.600
He was screwing off

31:15.600 --> 31:17.066
all season long.

31:17.066 --> 31:18.567
- Chris, Chris, where are you?

31:18.567 --> 31:20.000
Don't be shy, Chris.

31:20.000 --> 31:21.700
- How do I--
- F---ing heavy.

31:21.700 --> 31:23.667
- How come I'm the only one
on this boat gets hangovers?

31:23.667 --> 31:25.066
- Work through it, man.

31:25.066 --> 31:26.266
- I am so tired.

31:26.266 --> 31:27.734
- As far as Chris,

31:27.734 --> 31:29.734
he's just making my job
more difficult.

31:29.734 --> 31:31.600
- I need to focus on
the members of the deck crew

31:31.600 --> 31:33.200
that are actually putting forth
an effort

31:33.200 --> 31:35.333
and trying to do
the right thing.

31:35.333 --> 31:37.133
What I'm gonna do is,

31:37.133 --> 31:39.567
you can go down
and get your stuff ready.

31:39.567 --> 31:41.567
I'll put you up in St. Barts
for a night.

31:41.567 --> 31:44.200
You got a pocket
full of cash, so...

31:44.200 --> 31:46.700
Good luck to you
in the future, sir.

31:46.700 --> 31:48.266
- I'll go get packed.
Finish eating.

31:48.266 --> 31:50.667
- Okay, I'll get you
transport to shore.

31:50.667 --> 31:51.700
- Sweet.
- All right?

31:51.700 --> 31:53.433
- Thanks, Captain.

31:53.433 --> 31:55.433
I cannot wait
for the other deckhands

31:55.433 --> 31:59.233
to mess up and for the holes
to really shine through

31:59.233 --> 32:01.100
on how ill-equipped they are.

32:01.100 --> 32:02.600
I'm out of here.
- What?

32:02.600 --> 32:05.200
- Build a sh---y team,
you get sh---y results.

32:05.200 --> 32:07.633
Cleveland Browns aren't going
to the Super Bowl, you know?

32:07.633 --> 32:09.633
I was just dealt
a sh---y hand,

32:09.633 --> 32:12.333
and nobody seemed to do
anything to help me with it,

32:12.333 --> 32:13.600
and that sucks.

32:13.600 --> 32:16.066
[moans]
- Heart-to-heart.

32:16.066 --> 32:18.100
- Thanks.
- Roomie.

32:18.100 --> 32:21.233
- Chris, your tender
has arrived.

32:21.233 --> 32:22.633
- I carry that for you.

32:22.633 --> 32:24.233
That's f---ing--you don't
carry your own bags.

32:24.233 --> 32:27.200
- Chris Brown and yachting.
[laughs]

32:27.200 --> 32:29.066
Cool, I just got fired.
What do I do now?

32:29.066 --> 32:30.233
- I hope for you the best.

32:30.233 --> 32:31.633
- I'll be sitting on the beach,

32:31.633 --> 32:33.433
getting drunk
and picking up chicks

32:33.433 --> 32:35.233
and probably getting laid
a lot sooner

32:35.233 --> 32:36.433
than if I finish out
this charter season.

32:36.433 --> 32:38.533
Who gives a sh--?

32:38.533 --> 32:40.367
- Bye, Chris.

32:40.367 --> 32:42.200
- Didn't even get to say bye
to the f---ing guy.

32:44.367 --> 32:45.667
- Nico, can we have a little

32:45.667 --> 32:47.266
chat up on the bow, man?
- Yeah.

32:47.266 --> 32:48.533
- I don't know how I feel
about that.

32:48.533 --> 32:49.734
- I know.
- So yeah, man.

32:49.734 --> 32:51.633
Just wanted to chat with you

32:51.633 --> 32:53.266
about how you think
the whole thing went.

32:53.266 --> 32:55.000
- Lot of f----ups
on the last day.

32:55.000 --> 32:58.266
- So what about things
between me and you?

32:58.266 --> 33:00.000
- Um...

33:00.000 --> 33:02.367
- The thing I'm just
finding slightly annoying

33:02.367 --> 33:04.500
is, like, I'll tell somebody
to do something,

33:04.500 --> 33:06.533
and then you'll be like,
"No, no, no, don't do that!"

33:06.533 --> 33:07.633
It's like, "Ugh."

33:07.633 --> 33:09.133
- Because there's a way

33:09.133 --> 33:10.400
that certain things
need to be done

33:10.400 --> 33:13.266
that you're still
getting used to.

33:13.266 --> 33:16.000
- Undermining me
in front of them is not cool.

33:16.000 --> 33:17.333
If I say something, it goes.

33:17.333 --> 33:19.166
- You know what?

33:19.166 --> 33:21.633
I'm not gonna sit here
and go back and forth with you.

33:21.633 --> 33:24.300
We're just gonna keep running
like we've ran before.

33:24.300 --> 33:25.667
- Nobody talks to me this way,

33:25.667 --> 33:27.433
especially if they're under me.

33:27.433 --> 33:30.166
Come on, man.

33:30.166 --> 33:32.100
- I feel really bad for Chris,

33:32.100 --> 33:35.100
'cause, you know, he didn't lie
about his experience.

33:35.100 --> 33:38.567
So for his lack of experience
to be the reason

33:38.567 --> 33:40.433
he was forced to leave
is like, well, you knew--

33:40.433 --> 33:42.266
- He didn't say he was
a f---ing--

33:42.266 --> 33:43.533
Yeah, I know
exactly what you mean.

33:43.533 --> 33:44.667
I'm gonna miss Chris.

33:44.667 --> 33:46.433
I enjoyed his company.

33:46.433 --> 33:47.567
I mean, he never had
his heart in this,

33:47.567 --> 33:49.667
but I'm gonna miss him.

33:49.667 --> 33:50.767
- Did you say bye to Chris?

33:54.633 --> 33:56.400
- Sh---y.

33:59.533 --> 34:01.300
- On deck.
- Yeah.

34:02.200 --> 34:03.700
- How can I help you?

34:03.700 --> 34:06.166
- You can organize
those two cabinets.

34:07.133 --> 34:08.467
- Mm-hmm.

34:10.467 --> 34:12.600
- Oh.
Sure, yeah.

34:12.600 --> 34:14.300
- What are you gonna do?

34:14.300 --> 34:16.000
- She wants me
to pull everything out

34:16.000 --> 34:17.567
and reorganize it.

34:17.567 --> 34:20.033
- No, I know, but what else--
what are you gonna do?

34:20.033 --> 34:21.533
- Finish the fridge.

34:21.533 --> 34:24.033
- Jen acts so put-upon,
but, actually,

34:24.033 --> 34:25.533
we do the same amount of work.

34:25.533 --> 34:26.600
She just complains
a lot more than I do.

34:26.600 --> 34:29.300
- Ugh!
Something reeks.

34:29.300 --> 34:30.600
- We're flipping the boat,
