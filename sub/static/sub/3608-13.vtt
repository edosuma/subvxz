00:02.001 --> 00:03.378
Previously on Lost:

00:03.462 --> 00:07.924
- Charlie. Give me the baby.
- Who the hell are you, John?

00:08.007 --> 00:11.678
Aaron's not your responsibility.
Where were you when he was born?

00:11.762 --> 00:13.763
Where were you when he was taken?

00:13.847 --> 00:17.517
You're not his father.
You're not his family.

00:17.601 --> 00:19.686
Neither are you, Charlie.

00:23.440 --> 00:24.732
I'm sorry.

00:29.571 --> 00:34.659
This is not your island.
This is our island.

00:34.743 --> 00:37.286
And the only reason you're living on it

00:37.371 --> 00:39.789
is because we let you live on it.

00:41.291 --> 00:43.918
Right here, there's a line.

00:44.878 --> 00:47.046
You cross that line,

00:47.131 --> 00:51.843
we go from misunderstanding
to something else.

00:52.720 --> 00:54.887
It's your call, Jack.

00:54.972 --> 00:58.391
- Sayid tells me that you're a cop.
- I was a cop.

00:59.810 --> 01:03.020
- Can I ask you something?
- Shoot.

01:05.566 --> 01:09.277
How long do you think it would take
to train an army?

01:26.044 --> 01:28.087
- Is that all of them?
- All six of them.

01:28.172 --> 01:32.216
Plus... one box of ammo.

01:33.927 --> 01:38.848
At least we don't have to worry
about running out anytime soon.

01:38.932 --> 01:42.977
Jack, I'm grateful that you decided
to keep them all in the same place.

01:45.272 --> 01:49.358
I had to take them from Charlie.
His heroin stash.

01:50.778 --> 01:54.405
I figured it might have therapeutic
value, if it ever came to that.

01:54.490 --> 01:56.949
You're just gonna leave it all
in the statues?

01:57.034 --> 02:01.871
You wanna break seven Virgin Marys,
be my guest. I'm superstitious.

02:01.955 --> 02:04.123
John.

02:04.958 --> 02:06.334
The combination.

02:11.548 --> 02:13.716
I'm gonna assume that you're asking me

02:13.801 --> 02:17.804
because you're worried that I might
fall off a cliff or something,

02:17.888 --> 02:21.724
that it's irresponsible for just one
of us to have access to this room,

02:21.809 --> 02:25.853
rather than this being
an issue of trust.

02:26.897 --> 02:30.608
Well, there are a lot of cliffs
on this island, John.

02:35.572 --> 02:38.157
All right.
But I think we should agree, Jack,

02:38.242 --> 02:41.994
that if either of us need to open
this door, we consult each other first.

02:42.079 --> 02:43.996
Absolutely.

02:44.081 --> 02:47.208
Right seven, left 33, right 18.

02:47.292 --> 02:49.627
- You need to write it down?
- No. I got it.

02:49.711 --> 02:52.171
All right.

02:52.256 --> 02:56.008
And, Jack, you may want to consider
locking the medicine in here, too.

02:57.302 --> 03:00.137
Why would I need to do that?

03:00.222 --> 03:06.143
Well, well. Look who had to relocate
to the suburbs.

03:12.860 --> 03:15.695
Ain't that just like a woman?

03:15.779 --> 03:19.824
She keeps the house
and you get the cheap-ass apartment.

03:21.493 --> 03:25.371
Man, I thought these people hated me,
but I gotta hand it to you.

03:25.455 --> 03:28.499
Stealing the baby
and trying to drown it?

03:28.584 --> 03:32.879
Now, that's a new low.
You even made Locke take a swing at you.

03:32.963 --> 03:36.173
Hell, that's like getting Gandhi
to beat his kids.

03:37.217 --> 03:41.178
Shouldn't you be more worried about Jack
ransacking your tent right now?

03:41.263 --> 03:43.264
What?

03:51.315 --> 03:55.735
- What the hell you think you're doing?
- You stole these from the hatch.

03:55.819 --> 03:58.029
- You stole them from me.
- What?

03:58.113 --> 04:00.740
They were in my stash.
I took back what was mine.

04:00.824 --> 04:04.076
These belong to all of us, Sawyer.
To the group.

04:04.161 --> 04:07.705
- You don't have a stash anymore.
- Doc, you don't wanna do this.

04:09.166 --> 04:12.126
Just give me the pills,
we'll forget it ever happened.

04:14.004 --> 04:16.589
Are you threatening me?

04:16.673 --> 04:19.257
Last chance, Doc.

04:58.340 --> 05:01.008
What do you want, right now?

05:03.220 --> 05:05.471
Just you.

05:14.648 --> 05:17.024
Oh, damn it.

05:17.109 --> 05:19.443
What is it?

05:19.528 --> 05:23.030
I'm gonna be late
for that meeting I told you about.

05:23.115 --> 05:27.827
Meeting, huh? You got another date,
you can just say so.

05:27.911 --> 05:33.374
I can only wrap my mind
around one woman at a time,

05:33.458 --> 05:35.835
but I appreciate the permission.

05:35.919 --> 05:38.796
Back in a flash, gorgeous.

05:43.010 --> 05:46.303
You weren't exactly
supposed to see that.

05:47.681 --> 05:49.015
Are you serious?

05:50.934 --> 05:53.144
- What?
- You're not serious?

05:54.396 --> 05:58.858
You just happen to have
a suitcase full of cash,

05:58.942 --> 06:02.570
and you go to pick it up
and then the lock just happens to break?

06:06.241 --> 06:08.451
- Give me that.
- It's not even real.

06:10.704 --> 06:12.621
Newspaper?

06:14.916 --> 06:16.876
Are you trying to con me?

06:16.960 --> 06:19.462
What, I ask you what all the money's for

06:19.546 --> 06:23.382
and you do some song and dance
about an investment or something

06:23.467 --> 06:26.510
and then I say,
"Hey, oh, I've got some money."

06:27.554 --> 06:30.139
Look, you got me.

06:31.975 --> 06:34.477
Good for you.

06:34.561 --> 06:36.729
No harm, no foul.

06:36.813 --> 06:39.231
You should've done your homework.

06:39.316 --> 06:42.401
I didn't take anything from him
in the divorce.

06:45.489 --> 06:47.823
I'm not even worth your trouble.

06:53.413 --> 06:55.664
Well, shame on me.

06:57.375 --> 06:59.376
I want you to show me what you do.

07:03.757 --> 07:07.551
Show me what you do.
What you really do.

07:08.178 --> 07:10.012
And what do I do?

07:11.598 --> 07:14.683
Show me how to con people, Sawyer.

07:21.942 --> 07:24.026
I like what you've done with the place.

07:25.821 --> 07:27.655
Maid's day off.

07:29.866 --> 07:32.201
You wanna move?

07:34.246 --> 07:39.041
- Heard Jack took your painkillers.
- Guess me and the doc are on the outs.

07:39.126 --> 07:41.877
One less Christmas card
I'll have to send this year.

07:41.962 --> 07:45.047
Maybe that'll cheer you up.
It's from the hatch.

07:45.132 --> 07:47.466
I know you're hard up
for reading material.

07:47.551 --> 07:52.471
Well, as much as I'd like to learn
to "feather my hair,"

07:52.556 --> 07:55.266
I lost my damn glasses on the raft.

07:58.728 --> 08:00.604
You wanna read it to me?

08:00.689 --> 08:02.815
You got an appointment or something?

08:02.899 --> 08:04.859
OK.

08:10.073 --> 08:13.659
All right. "Ten Ways To Tell
If He's A Sensitive Man."

08:13.743 --> 08:16.162
- This ought to be good.
- Morning.

08:16.246 --> 08:18.247
Hey, John.

08:20.667 --> 08:23.460
Now, there's a sensitive man.

08:23.545 --> 08:26.255
- Claire asked him to sleep down here.
- Come on.

08:26.339 --> 08:29.800
Locke's got himself needs,

08:29.885 --> 08:32.635
just like anyone else.

08:32.721 --> 08:34.763
Not everyone is like you, Sawyer.

08:35.682 --> 08:40.686
Guess that's why El Jacko and Ana Lulu
didn't ask me to join their revolution.

08:43.315 --> 08:46.317
What? You didn't hear
about their little army?

08:49.738 --> 08:52.781
Guess I'm not the only one
on the outs with the doc.

09:03.960 --> 09:05.961
Hey, man.

09:06.046 --> 09:09.381
You gonna put the lime in the coconut,
drink them both up?

09:12.260 --> 09:14.261
Lime in the coconut?

09:15.138 --> 09:16.555
The song?

09:17.474 --> 09:20.059
What do you want, Hurley?

09:20.143 --> 09:22.228
I'm over at Rose and Bernard's tent...

09:22.312 --> 09:25.356
Did you know he's a dentist?

09:25.440 --> 09:28.025
Well, that's not all
he's been holding out on us.

09:28.109 --> 09:30.986
He picked up Boone's signal
from the Norwegian plane.

09:31.071 --> 09:33.072
Nigerian.

09:33.156 --> 09:36.909
Right. Anyhow,
he picked it up with this.

09:40.455 --> 09:44.416
That is a shortwave radio.
It's a glorified walkie-talkie.

09:44.501 --> 09:48.587
Yeah, but can't you switch a blue wire
with a red wire and make it stronger?

09:48.672 --> 09:51.548
We tried to send a signal
with the plane's transceiver

09:51.633 --> 09:54.760
and all we got was
the French woman's message on a loop.

09:54.844 --> 09:58.389
- Why would I bother?
- Come on, man. I mean, it's worth...

09:58.473 --> 10:02.184
It's worth nothing.
It's a waste of time.

10:03.979 --> 10:06.105
I was just trying to cheer you up, dude.

10:06.189 --> 10:09.024
I don't need cheering up.

10:09.109 --> 10:12.653
OK, man. Sorry. No problem.

10:24.541 --> 10:30.504
Hey.

10:30.588 --> 10:32.923
- Hey.
- You get the combo?

10:34.759 --> 10:39.471
Nice. Didn't think it'd be that easy
convincing your pal to give it up.

10:41.099 --> 10:43.892
That's the nice thing about you people,

10:43.977 --> 10:45.978
you're not scared enough.

10:47.272 --> 10:51.984
- Not scared enough?
- Same reason no one'll join the army.

10:52.068 --> 10:56.238
Everyone around here
actually thinks they're safe.

10:57.741 --> 11:01.243
Trust me, Ana, no one thinks we're safe.

11:04.664 --> 11:08.417
So, Jack, what's the combo?

11:12.839 --> 11:15.174
I was just kidding.

11:56.800 --> 12:00.135
Oh, Vincent.

12:00.220 --> 12:02.554
What are you doing out here?

12:25.120 --> 12:29.248
Oh, man, it's really coming down.
Get under here, Freckles.

12:29.332 --> 12:33.335
- I like the rain.
- Yeah, me too, from under here.

12:35.755 --> 12:38.674
- What the hell?
- It's Sun.

12:58.194 --> 13:00.571
- Is she all right?
- She's breathing.

13:00.655 --> 13:02.990
Go get Jack. Go get Jack.

13:03.074 --> 13:04.741
OK.

13:09.956 --> 13:11.957
- What happened?
- Where's Jack?

13:17.630 --> 13:20.257
Was she conscious at all?
Did she say anything?

13:20.341 --> 13:22.301
Nothing. Not a word.

13:22.385 --> 13:24.595
She's OK. She's going to be all right.

13:24.679 --> 13:28.098
You need to let me take care of her,
all right? Please.

13:28.725 --> 13:31.894
- How'd you find her?
- I heard her scream.

13:31.978 --> 13:34.563
She was out cold,
and her hands were tied.

13:34.647 --> 13:37.649
What do you mean, her hands were tied?

13:38.651 --> 13:40.652
They're back.

13:48.870 --> 13:52.748
- They said they would leave us alone.
- They broke their promise.

13:52.832 --> 13:55.834
- We don't even know what happened.
- Do we need to know?

13:59.047 --> 14:01.757
- Where'd you find her?
- Just outside her garden.

14:01.841 --> 14:04.635
We should take a look around. With guns.

14:04.719 --> 14:06.637
No.

14:07.388 --> 14:08.347
No?

14:08.431 --> 14:13.435
We arm up, we're just as likely to shoot
each other as we are one of them.

14:14.979 --> 14:20.317
OK. We'll wait for Sun to wake up.
She'll tell us what happened.

14:20.401 --> 14:22.903
Then we're gonna do something about it.

14:24.155 --> 14:26.156
Sounds like a plan.

14:36.251 --> 14:38.877
They usually don't leave any trail.

14:38.962 --> 14:40.963
It's worth a look.

14:42.632 --> 14:45.050
Let me ask you something.

14:45.134 --> 14:47.928
This whole scenario make sense to you?

14:48.012 --> 14:50.013
What do you mean?

14:50.098 --> 14:53.684
Think about it.
First off, how'd she get away?

14:53.768 --> 14:57.479
- Woman doesn't weigh 100 pounds.
- She was fighting for her life.

14:57.564 --> 15:00.816
- People are capable of anything...
- You couldn't get away.

15:00.900 --> 15:03.652
And you versus Sun,
hot-oil death match?

15:03.736 --> 15:05.737
My money's on you, Sheena.

15:05.822 --> 15:08.323
Thanks for your vote of confidence.

15:18.167 --> 15:21.420
It's a hood, just like the one
they put over my head.

15:23.006 --> 15:26.341
No, it's not.
This one's black. Different weave.

15:28.636 --> 15:33.140
It's all in the details,
and they're wrong.

15:35.560 --> 15:38.687
Well, if it wasn't them, then who?

15:41.274 --> 15:45.235
What are you saying, one of us did it?
Who the hell would wanna go after Sun?

15:45.320 --> 15:49.323
Not much upside
to scaring the crap out of 46 people.

15:50.533 --> 15:53.910
Unless you're trying to con them
into joining an army.

16:01.044 --> 16:03.295
Those necklaces are junk, Sawyer.

16:03.379 --> 16:05.339
A five-year-old could tell that.

16:05.423 --> 16:09.426
They ain't gonna look at the necklaces.
They're gonna look at the price.

16:09.510 --> 16:11.970
It's all in the details, Dimples.

16:12.055 --> 16:15.974
- What if we get caught?
- We ain't gonna get caught.

16:16.059 --> 16:20.520
Anybody goes to the cops,
the only thing they're gonna remember

16:20.605 --> 16:23.148
is a guy who looks like
he's been in a bar fight.

16:27.945 --> 16:31.657
- You're scared, huh?
- A little bit.

16:33.076 --> 16:37.120
Well, here's the good news, baby.
Everybody's scared.

16:38.539 --> 16:43.877
And the thing they're scared of most
is missing an opportunity.

16:49.133 --> 16:51.802
- This is all they had.
- Let's try down the street.

16:51.886 --> 16:56.139
Hey. You guys
wanna buy some necklaces?

16:56.224 --> 16:58.517
- Where'd you get them?
- Where do you think?

16:58.601 --> 17:01.061
You want to buy them or not?

17:04.691 --> 17:06.775
- Forget it.
- Hey, how much?

17:09.069 --> 17:11.113
- Hundred a piece.
- For any of them?

17:11.196 --> 17:14.031
Yeah, yeah. Taster's choice.

17:14.117 --> 17:18.161
I'll take the $1,200 one
and the $1,300 one.

17:20.373 --> 17:22.708
- Thanks.
- Hey, wait.

17:22.791 --> 17:27.170
- Wait up, man. I'll buy some of those.
- Yeah, me too.

17:28.881 --> 17:30.882
It's Dana's birthday next week.

17:30.967 --> 17:33.635
They love their jewelry.

17:34.971 --> 17:37.723
Five, six, seven hundred.

17:41.602 --> 17:44.855
Pulse is good, strong.

17:44.939 --> 17:47.274
You just need to watch her.

17:50.486 --> 17:52.821
She's gonna be OK, man.

18:14.510 --> 18:18.513
That bump on her head, do you think
she fell or that someone hit her?

18:18.598 --> 18:20.599
I don't know.

18:23.019 --> 18:26.021
Jack, how well do you know Ana Lucia?

18:30.693 --> 18:33.028
I was just... The Others...

18:35.031 --> 18:37.073
I was out there with you.

18:37.158 --> 18:40.410
I heard that man say if we stayed away,
they'd leave us alone.

18:40.495 --> 18:44.206
We've left them alone, so why would
they attack us a few days later?

18:45.708 --> 18:47.793
If it wasn't them, then who was it?

18:53.800 --> 18:56.676
Like I said,
how well do you know Ana Lucia?

19:14.070 --> 19:17.531
I got a couple more people
interested in joining up.

19:17.615 --> 19:18.949
Yeah? Who?

19:19.033 --> 19:22.828
The big guy
who lives behind Sayid, and Scott.

19:22.912 --> 19:25.914
You mean Steve. Scott's dead.

19:25.998 --> 19:28.041
Scott, Steve...

19:28.125 --> 19:31.127
The point is, after what happened,

19:31.212 --> 19:34.756
people are finally willing
to do something.

19:34.841 --> 19:37.843
Where were you this morning?

19:37.927 --> 19:41.429
- Lots of places.
- During the rainstorm.

19:45.476 --> 19:49.855
You think I had something
to do with Sun getting grabbed?

19:49.939 --> 19:52.399
Now, where would you
get an idea like that?

19:53.985 --> 19:56.319
Jack. Jack.

19:58.614 --> 20:01.491
Sun's awake.

20:06.664 --> 20:08.665
Hey.

20:10.209 --> 20:14.170
How's your head? Any pain? Dizziness?

20:14.255 --> 20:17.799
- Just a little bit.
- Do you remember anything?

20:17.884 --> 20:21.678
I was working in my garden
when Vincent ran up.

20:21.762 --> 20:27.058
It started raining, then there was a bag
over my head, and I was being dragged.

20:27.143 --> 20:30.979
- How many were there?
- I don't... I didn't see anything.

20:36.027 --> 20:41.865
I kicked and I fought, and I just ran
as fast as I could. And then I fell...

20:49.040 --> 21:00.008
Gun.

21:07.391 --> 21:10.226
Hey. What's going on?

21:11.187 --> 21:14.898
Looks like the good folks of Islandtown
are about to form a posse,

21:14.982 --> 21:17.776
get themselves armed up.

21:17.860 --> 21:21.279
I wouldn't be surprised
if Jack didn't find that horse of yours,

21:21.364 --> 21:24.115
start leading the charge
in a big white hat.

21:33.876 --> 21:36.419
The guns.

21:36.504 --> 21:39.506
This is all her play
to get her hands on the guns.

21:42.134 --> 21:45.136
Locke. You need to go
and tell him they're coming.

21:45.221 --> 21:47.389
I need to tell him?

21:48.307 --> 21:50.308
Sawyer, please.

21:56.732 --> 21:59.150
- So, what's next?
- Next?

21:59.235 --> 22:01.236
The next play.

22:03.155 --> 22:07.742
- I'll show you the pigeon drop.
- We already did that. Twice.

22:07.827 --> 22:11.454
And the Tulsa bag scam,
and the Looky-loo.

22:13.082 --> 22:16.334
- I wanna do a big one.
- You wanna do a big what?

22:16.419 --> 22:19.212
A big con.

22:19.296 --> 22:21.297
It's called a long con.

22:21.382 --> 22:25.510
OK, a long con. How does it work?

22:26.804 --> 22:31.725
It works by getting someone to ask you
to do something like it's their idea,

22:31.809 --> 22:34.477
but it's your idea.

22:34.562 --> 22:36.771
But none of that matters,

22:36.856 --> 22:41.401
'cause the one thing you need
for a long con, we ain't got.

22:41.485 --> 22:44.029
Money.

22:44.113 --> 22:46.072
I have money.

22:46.157 --> 22:50.785
Sorry, Cassie. 40 grand
in some mutual fund ain't money.

22:50.870 --> 22:55.290
Remember when I told you that
I didn't get anything from the divorce?

22:55.374 --> 22:57.375
I kind of lied.

22:58.586 --> 23:00.670
You kind of lied how much?

23:01.797 --> 23:03.798
600 grand.

23:06.802 --> 23:09.888
With that kind of money,
let's go find an island somewhere

23:09.972 --> 23:13.975
and sit on the beach
drinking mojitos till we go toes up.

23:14.060 --> 23:19.064
Sawyer, for the first time in my life
I'm actually happy.

23:20.357 --> 23:23.860
And it's not really about the action
or the money.

23:23.944 --> 23:27.030
It's about doing this with you.

23:28.324 --> 23:30.325
Come on.

23:30.409 --> 23:32.410
One long con.

23:34.830 --> 23:36.831
And then the mojitos.

23:41.170 --> 23:43.296
I'll think about it.

23:44.673 --> 23:47.133
Why don't you think about it in here?

23:59.438 --> 24:03.441
Hate to interrupt
whatever the hell it is you're doing.

24:04.318 --> 24:07.695
- What are you doing?
- I'm alphabetizing.

24:08.948 --> 24:11.616
Oh, sure.
Sun gets attacked in the jungle

24:11.700 --> 24:15.161
and you figure it's a good time
to start the Dewey decimal system.

24:15.246 --> 24:18.331
- Good thinking.
- How can I help you, James?

24:19.375 --> 24:23.878
Well, actually, John, I'm here
to help you, give you the heads up.

24:24.547 --> 24:25.547
Heads up?

24:25.631 --> 24:28.591
Jack's on his way over
to open your little gun closet

24:28.676 --> 24:32.428
and take whatever he needs.
You should know he's not alone.

24:32.513 --> 24:36.057
Whole camp's pretty shook up
about what happened to Tokyo Rose.

24:36.684 --> 24:40.645
I'm guessing everybody's gonna
wanna play cowboys and Indians.

24:40.729 --> 24:44.774
And once those guns are out and about,

24:44.859 --> 24:47.861
something tells me
they ain't never going back in.

24:53.117 --> 24:55.618
Why are you telling me this?

24:58.122 --> 25:00.498
Because it'll piss off Jack.

25:02.334 --> 25:06.546
But if I were you,
I'd change that combination pronto.

25:08.757 --> 25:11.926
But that won't work.
The door will just slow him down.

25:12.011 --> 25:14.762
If Jack wants to get in, he'll get in.

25:16.849 --> 25:18.850
Will you help me?

25:20.102 --> 25:22.812
Help you what?

25:22.897 --> 25:24.898
Move the guns.

25:26.692 --> 25:29.444
Move them where?

25:29.528 --> 25:32.530
Fine. You don't wanna trust me,
lots of luck.

25:32.615 --> 25:35.617
But I can't leave the hatch unmanned.

25:36.744 --> 25:39.871
Sure. You move the guns,

25:39.955 --> 25:43.249
and I'll stay here
and push your damn button for you.

25:43.334 --> 25:45.877
How long till they get here?

25:45.961 --> 25:49.297
Well, that ain't my problem, Hoss.
It's yours.

26:04.480 --> 26:07.649
Steak sandwich. Two beers.

26:09.485 --> 26:12.528
- Thank you.
- Aw, shucks. You got a beer for me?

26:12.613 --> 26:15.490
You want one, ask the lady.

26:16.242 --> 26:18.243
Well, hell, I do want one.

26:18.327 --> 26:22.372
And could I get a plate
of chicken salad, white meat only,

26:22.456 --> 26:24.832
and please, God, no celery,
OK, sweetheart?

26:24.917 --> 26:28.169
That's how we make it here, darlin'.

26:29.588 --> 26:33.341
So, tell me you got her.

26:38.055 --> 26:40.306
- Yeah, I got her.
- All 600 grand?

26:41.934 --> 26:44.435
All six.

26:47.690 --> 26:50.441
You fell for her.

26:50.526 --> 26:53.194
- You gotta be kidding me.
- It's got nothing...

26:53.279 --> 26:55.697
- I found that bitch.
- Her name is Cassidy.

26:55.781 --> 26:58.616
I waited six months
while you played house.

26:58.701 --> 27:00.702
I ain't doing it.

27:02.246 --> 27:05.456
Know what's making you stupid?
It's your damn hormones.

27:05.541 --> 27:08.459
You think you're in love,
but you're not.

27:08.544 --> 27:11.337
A tiger doesn't change
his stripes, James.

27:11.422 --> 27:13.298
You're a con man, just like me.

27:13.382 --> 27:15.800
And it's not what you do,
it's what you are.

27:15.884 --> 27:17.927
Do I make myself clear?

27:21.015 --> 27:23.641
I'm sorry, man. I just can't do it.

27:23.726 --> 27:25.852
No, you're gonna do it.

27:25.936 --> 27:29.731
Because that girl,
she doesn't know you one bit.

27:30.357 --> 27:34.319
But when she finds out who you are,
who you really are,

27:34.403 --> 27:36.738
she's gonna hate your guts.

27:40.451 --> 27:42.452
Yeah, well...

27:45.581 --> 27:47.582
Enjoy your chicken salad, Gordy.

27:47.666 --> 27:50.418
Wait a minute. You don't walk away now.

27:50.502 --> 27:54.047
You owe me. You don't wanna pay me?

27:56.133 --> 27:58.968
I'll put one in your ear, James.

27:59.053 --> 28:02.055
You and your little friend Cassidy.

28:24.244 --> 28:26.371
- What are you doing here?
- One second.

28:26.455 --> 28:29.332
I'm like this close to the high score
on Donkey Kong.

28:41.970 --> 28:44.180
Now, what can I do you for?

28:44.264 --> 28:46.849
- Where's Locke?
- I don't know.

28:46.934 --> 28:51.437
I think he said something about going
to the store for a pack of smokes.

29:09.164 --> 29:12.250
Uh-oh.
Looks like we got ourselves a theft.

29:12.334 --> 29:15.253
- Who's gonna call the cops?
- Where are they?

29:15.337 --> 29:18.423
Don't look at me.
I was just pushing the button.

29:19.716 --> 29:23.052
Oh, yeah. I believe these are yours.

29:31.103 --> 29:32.520
No.

29:55.461 --> 29:59.005
John. Where are they?

29:59.089 --> 30:01.591
You moved the guns. Where are they?

30:03.177 --> 30:04.635
We had an agreement.

30:04.720 --> 30:07.180
An agreement you were about to violate.

30:09.391 --> 30:11.476
Yes, I moved the guns.

30:11.560 --> 30:13.561
Where?

30:14.354 --> 30:16.814
Where? Where, John?

30:16.899 --> 30:19.901
Are you going to start handing them out?

30:19.985 --> 30:22.403
How many? Who gets them?

30:24.406 --> 30:28.159
How much time before
there's an accident? Another accident?

30:30.537 --> 30:34.540
I made a mistake teaching Michael
how to shoot, and now he's...

30:34.625 --> 30:38.294
He could be dead for all I know,
and that was my fault.

30:38.378 --> 30:43.174
I take responsibility for that, so I'm
taking responsibility for the guns, too.

30:43.258 --> 30:46.260
- I want two guns.
- That's the way it's gonna be, Jack.

30:46.345 --> 30:48.513
Tell me where they are right now.

31:00.442 --> 31:02.777
You gave him the guns?

31:03.695 --> 31:06.948
No, I hid them.

31:07.032 --> 31:10.618
That's right, Jack.
He's as stupid as you are.

31:11.245 --> 31:15.581
You were so busy worrying about each
other, you never even saw me coming.

31:21.797 --> 31:26.968
So, how about you listen up?
Because I'm only gonna say this once.

31:30.097 --> 31:32.640
You took my stuff.

31:32.724 --> 31:37.895
While I was off trying to get us help,
get us rescued,

31:37.980 --> 31:42.525
you found my stash,
and you took it, divvied it up.

31:42.609 --> 31:46.237
My shaving cream, my batteries,

31:46.321 --> 31:48.864
even my beer.

31:48.949 --> 31:51.409
And then something else happened.

31:51.493 --> 31:56.247
You decided these two boys were gonna
tell you what to do and when to do it.

31:57.541 --> 31:59.709
Well, I'm done taking orders.

32:02.838 --> 32:05.339
And I don't want my stuff back.

32:07.342 --> 32:09.343
Shaving cream don't matter.

32:10.137 --> 32:12.221
Batteries don't matter.

32:13.223 --> 32:18.102
Only thing that matters now are guns.

32:20.063 --> 32:24.066
And if you want one, you're gonna
have to come to me to get it.

32:28.697 --> 32:31.657
Oh, you wanna torture me, don't you?

32:31.742 --> 32:34.744
Show everybody how civilized you are.

32:37.456 --> 32:41.792
Go ahead, but I'll die
before I give them back.

32:43.670 --> 32:46.422
And then you'll really be screwed,
won't you?

32:53.388 --> 32:56.057
There's a new sheriff in town, boys.

32:59.061 --> 33:02.104
Y'all best get used to it.

33:21.875 --> 33:24.377
What's going on? Where were you?

33:26.046 --> 33:28.673
Sawyer, what happened?

33:28.757 --> 33:30.925
- You see that black car?
- Who is it?

33:31.593 --> 33:35.346
- His name's Gordy. My partner.
- What partner?

33:35.430 --> 33:39.600
If I don't walk out with that briefcase
in two minutes, we're both dead.

33:39.685 --> 33:42.186
That's the guy from the Mercado deal?

33:42.270 --> 33:44.313
There is no Mercado deal.

33:45.148 --> 33:49.360
I knew about the 600 grand
you had tucked away from the get-go.

33:50.362 --> 33:52.363
Cass...

33:53.615 --> 33:55.825
You were the long con.

34:00.664 --> 34:04.375
Son of a bitch. Go to hell. Go to hell.

34:04.459 --> 34:07.211
You gotta understand.

34:07.295 --> 34:10.589
Everything that's happened between us
in the past six months,

34:10.674 --> 34:13.676
all of it, that was real.

34:13.760 --> 34:16.303
- Get out. You get out.
- Listen.

34:16.388 --> 34:18.848
You can hate me all you want later,

34:18.931 --> 34:21.516
but right now you gotta listen to me.

34:22.561 --> 34:25.563
He's gonna kill us.

34:25.647 --> 34:28.940
'Cause I told him
I wasn't gonna take your money.

34:33.029 --> 34:34.612
- Oh, my God.
- Look...

34:38.409 --> 34:42.079
OK. This is what we're gonna do.

34:42.164 --> 34:44.081
Go out back through Evan's yard.

34:44.166 --> 34:46.542
There's a rental car parked out front.

34:46.626 --> 34:48.793
Go to Sioux City.

34:48.879 --> 34:52.882
I want you to check in
to the Sage Flower Motel.

34:53.592 --> 34:55.592
It's off Highway 29.

34:56.594 --> 35:01.182
Watch TV, have a drink, and wait for me.

35:01.266 --> 35:04.435
I'll be there in the a.m.
It'll all be over.

35:04.519 --> 35:08.189
- Let me just pack a few...
- There's no time.

35:08.940 --> 35:12.610
You remember when you said
I was all you ever wanted?

35:13.695 --> 35:16.572
Well, now you know better.

35:21.578 --> 35:23.704
I love you.

35:25.791 --> 35:28.209
I love you, too.

35:31.171 --> 35:34.006
Go. Go.

35:48.396 --> 35:50.898
How'd you do it?

35:50.982 --> 35:52.983
How'd I do what?

35:54.069 --> 35:56.946
Locke said that he left you in the hatch

35:57.030 --> 35:59.657
when he went to hide the guns,

35:59.741 --> 36:02.743
and we both know
you can't track worth a damn.

36:04.538 --> 36:07.039
So how'd you get them?

36:08.917 --> 36:12.211
Magician never tells his secrets.

36:13.755 --> 36:17.508
You played us. You played me.

36:19.386 --> 36:23.180
All that stuff you said about Ana Lucia.
You knew I would go to Jack.

36:23.265 --> 36:27.268
And you knew I'd ask you to go to Locke.

36:27.352 --> 36:30.855
Now how in the world
would I know all that?

36:32.941 --> 36:36.485
Did you have anything to do with Sun?

36:36.570 --> 36:39.196
What kind of person do you think I am?

36:39.281 --> 36:42.908
What kind of a person
do I think you are?

36:42.993 --> 36:46.412
I don't think
this has anything to do with guns,

36:46.496 --> 36:48.664
or with getting your stash back.

36:48.748 --> 36:51.542
I think you want people to hate you.

36:56.631 --> 36:59.466
Good thing you don't hate me, Freckles.

37:08.727 --> 37:10.853
Why do you have to do this?

37:13.481 --> 37:15.482
You run, I con.

37:17.652 --> 37:20.154
A tiger don't change her stripes.

37:48.433 --> 37:52.353
Hey, check this out. I found
a manuscript in one of the suitcases.

37:52.437 --> 37:56.440
- It's like a mystery book.
- I want to show you something.

37:59.277 --> 38:01.862
- Cool. You fixed it.
- We'll see.

38:03.073 --> 38:05.115
Hold onto this.

38:05.200 --> 38:07.534
Don't expect anything.

38:07.619 --> 38:11.830
The chances of getting a signal
are slim at best.

38:21.758 --> 38:25.803
- Static's good, right?
- No. Reception is good.

38:28.556 --> 38:30.808
- What's that?
- It's Rousseau's signal.

38:30.892 --> 38:34.561
- Oh, crap.
- But this radio has a wider bandwidth.

38:38.066 --> 38:40.567
Oh, wait. Stop. Do you hear that?

38:41.277 --> 38:43.362
That was the... Just A-Settin'...

38:45.115 --> 38:50.661
...Duke Ellington Orchestra,
featuring Cootie... the trumpet.

38:50.745 --> 38:52.997
Up next on WXR,

38:53.081 --> 38:57.459
the Glenn Miller Orchestra
with Moonlight Serenade.

39:07.012 --> 39:08.929
Whoa.

39:09.014 --> 39:11.265
You hear how clear that is?

39:11.349 --> 39:13.517
That's gotta be close, right?

39:13.601 --> 39:16.729
Radio waves at this frequency
bounce off the ionosphere.

39:18.606 --> 39:21.108
They can travel thousands of miles.

39:22.777 --> 39:25.571
It could be coming from anywhere.

39:29.743 --> 39:31.744
Or any time.

39:36.332 --> 39:38.459
Just kidding, dude.

40:13.286 --> 40:15.287
He never saw you, huh?

40:16.998 --> 40:22.086
No. He was more worried about
his sodding guns than being followed.

40:28.426 --> 40:31.845
Figured you'd want your friends back.

40:31.930 --> 40:35.849
If I wanted them, I would've taken them
before I told you where they were.

40:35.934 --> 40:38.769
That's not why I did it.

40:38.853 --> 40:43.690
- It's not, huh?
- I wanted him to look like a fool.

40:43.775 --> 40:46.443
To feel like a fool.

40:47.737 --> 40:52.950
Well, well. Looks like Johnny Locke's
got himself a nemesis.

40:53.910 --> 40:59.832
Sun can never find out
what I did to her. Never.

41:02.585 --> 41:05.254
Don't sweat it.

41:05.338 --> 41:07.798
They got bigger things
to worry about now.

41:12.220 --> 41:14.429
Sawyer.

41:16.432 --> 41:20.102
This idea, all of this, what we did,

41:21.604 --> 41:23.605
what made...

41:25.108 --> 41:28.318
How does someone
think of something like that?

41:35.243 --> 41:37.244
Now, go.

42:14.616 --> 42:16.783
One Mississippi,

42:17.785 --> 42:19.786
two Mississippi,

42:20.955 --> 42:22.956
three Mississippi,

42:23.791 --> 42:25.792
four Mississippi,

42:28.046 --> 42:30.047
five Mississippi...

43:19.013 --> 43:21.515
I'm not a good person, Charlie.

43:23.559 --> 43:26.061
Never did a good thing in my life.
