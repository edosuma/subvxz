WEBVTT

00:04.105 --> 00:05.939
( Ball thumping )

00:06.006 --> 00:08.442
( Owl hooting )

00:09.477 --> 00:11.079
It's an owl.

00:12.913 --> 00:15.116
I've never seen an owl.

00:18.519 --> 00:20.921
( Owl continues hooting )

00:20.988 --> 00:23.824
Hey, Mr. Owl?

00:23.891 --> 00:26.727
I'm not gonna hurt ya.
Just wanna get a look at ya.

00:27.895 --> 00:29.630
( Imitating owl hooting )

00:31.099 --> 00:32.900
( Hoots )

00:38.472 --> 00:41.542
You gotta be kidding me!

00:41.609 --> 00:43.577
( Grunts, exhales sharply )

00:43.644 --> 00:45.413
( Sighs )

00:46.747 --> 00:48.749
( Grunts )

00:48.816 --> 00:52.086
( Grunting continues )

00:52.153 --> 00:53.321
( Sighs )

00:56.924 --> 00:58.426
( Grunting )

01:02.163 --> 01:04.165
Oh! ( Grunting )

01:04.232 --> 01:05.666
Oh, no!

01:05.733 --> 01:08.269
( Grunting )

01:08.336 --> 01:12.106
( Grunting continues )

01:12.173 --> 01:13.374
( Sighs )

01:14.375 --> 01:17.245
( Siren whoops )

01:17.311 --> 01:19.012
( Vehicle door closes )

01:19.079 --> 01:23.117
Hey! I know that face.
Gable.

01:23.184 --> 01:26.120
Dawson?
You guys got here fast.

01:26.187 --> 01:28.656
No, no, no. Sergeant Mendez
wants to see you.

01:28.722 --> 01:30.524
Your wife said you'd be here.
Listen, uh,

01:30.591 --> 01:32.226
I'm kind of in the middle
of something here.

01:32.293 --> 01:35.296
Yeah, a window.
I can see that.

01:35.363 --> 01:37.665
All right, come on. I'll take
you down to the station.

01:37.731 --> 01:39.099
Hey, uh, do me a favor.

01:39.167 --> 01:40.768
Let's just keep this
between us, okay?

01:40.834 --> 01:42.970
Oh, absolutely. Absolutely.

01:43.036 --> 01:45.139
( Camera shutter clicking )

01:45.206 --> 01:50.077
* I am not your ordinary guy

01:50.144 --> 01:51.212
Hey, babe.

01:51.279 --> 01:52.780
Hey. What happened to
your jacket?

01:52.846 --> 01:55.416
Oh. I got into a little
situation at work.

01:55.483 --> 01:56.584
Were you trying
to steal candy

01:56.650 --> 01:57.918
out of
the vending machine again?

01:57.985 --> 02:00.254
( Clattering )

02:01.622 --> 02:02.923
I wasn't stealing, all right?

02:02.990 --> 02:04.325
That machine
wouldn't take my dollar.

02:04.392 --> 02:05.993
Honey, you tipped it over.

02:06.059 --> 02:07.628
I didn't tip it over.
I kept feeding it in there.

02:07.695 --> 02:09.463
And then finally when it did,
the spring released,

02:09.530 --> 02:10.798
and then the Doritos
just got stuck

02:10.864 --> 02:12.166
and they were hanging there.

02:12.233 --> 02:13.601
And I shoved it and I broke
the sheet rock behind it.

02:13.667 --> 02:15.903
-That's all.
-I don't -- Okay.

02:15.969 --> 02:17.838
Well, they're gonna
charge you for that.

02:17.905 --> 02:19.840
Yeah, I'm pretty sure they're
just gonna fire me.

02:19.907 --> 02:22.276
Oh, great.
Yeah.

02:22.343 --> 02:24.578
Oh, and, uh, Sergeant Mendez
called me and he, uh,

02:24.645 --> 02:26.079
he wants me to go back
undercover.

02:26.146 --> 02:27.381
What? You're retired.

02:27.448 --> 02:29.116
I know. But these guys
are close to makin' a bust.

02:29.183 --> 02:31.452
Remember those guys selling
that counterfeit art?

02:31.519 --> 02:32.753
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

02:32.820 --> 02:34.488
Yeah, well, one of them's
been asking about me.

02:34.555 --> 02:36.190
So they need me
to make an appearance.

02:36.257 --> 02:38.792
They want the big dog
to bark one more time.

02:38.859 --> 02:40.594
Okay.

02:40.661 --> 02:43.731
So wait, are you thinking
about going back
on the force?

02:43.797 --> 02:45.699
No. It's just -- it's one day
like jury duty.

02:45.766 --> 02:49.370
Jury duty
can go on for months.

02:49.437 --> 02:50.638
Not if you tell them
you're a pirate.

02:50.704 --> 02:52.373
You're out in one day.

02:52.440 --> 02:54.442
-Okay.
-Also good news --

02:54.508 --> 02:56.277
it's not gonna affect me
going to Mets Fantasy Camp.

02:56.344 --> 02:58.145
Oh, good. I was worried.

02:58.212 --> 03:00.548
Now you and your friends
can go to Florida
and pretend that

03:00.614 --> 03:03.050
Mookie Wilson really wants
to have a catch with you.

03:03.116 --> 03:05.886
Hey, I paid extra for that,
okay?

03:05.953 --> 03:07.255
And I don't care if
he's faking it or not.

03:07.321 --> 03:08.822
It's Mookie Wilson.

03:08.889 --> 03:11.425
Bored Mookie is still Mookie,
okay?

03:11.492 --> 03:12.893
-Okay.
-Hi, guys.

03:12.960 --> 03:14.795
-Hello, love.
-Hi. Hi.

03:14.862 --> 03:16.530
Chale -- whoa!

03:16.597 --> 03:19.032
What is it? Picture day down
at the unemployment office?

03:25.172 --> 03:27.475
Well, actually, I can't
get unemployment

03:27.541 --> 03:30.378
because I've never had a job,
so in your face.

03:32.780 --> 03:35.182
He's dressed nice
for a meeting, Dad.

03:35.249 --> 03:36.817
This tech start-up wants
to recruit him,

03:36.884 --> 03:38.452
and it would be
an amazing opportunity.

03:38.519 --> 03:40.654
He'd have a real job
and make great money.

03:40.721 --> 03:43.023
Ah, well, I don't know
if I'm taking it just yet.

03:43.090 --> 03:45.025
No, no, I know.
It's gotta be the right fit.

03:45.092 --> 03:46.827
-Mm-hmm.
-Sure. And, Chale, sweetie,

03:46.894 --> 03:49.129
I think what Kendra's trying
to say for all of us

03:49.196 --> 03:52.165
is you make it fit.

03:52.232 --> 03:55.035
Even if you gotta force it,
you just jam it in there.
Yeah.

03:57.771 --> 03:59.039
Wire him up.

03:59.106 --> 04:00.974
Good to see you, Gable.

04:01.041 --> 04:02.743
-Retirement looks good on you.
-( Sighs )

04:02.810 --> 04:05.245
Lot of guys
let themselves go.

04:05.313 --> 04:06.514
You're busting my chops,
right?

04:06.580 --> 04:09.583
100%. You look like crap.

04:09.650 --> 04:12.586
Hey, Officer Baskin-Robbins,
warm up the hands.

04:12.653 --> 04:15.155
It's like getting felt up
by a dead body.

04:15.222 --> 04:16.557
So what's the deal?

04:16.624 --> 04:18.158
All we gotta do is find
the location

04:18.225 --> 04:19.960
of where the deal's going down
and we're good.

04:20.027 --> 04:21.795
Let Cellucci take the lead.

04:21.862 --> 04:23.464
Cellucci?

04:23.531 --> 04:25.265
You didn't tell me
Cellucci's on this case.

04:25.333 --> 04:26.667
'Cause you wouldn't have
shown up.

04:26.734 --> 04:28.302
-( Sighs )
-Could be worse.

04:28.369 --> 04:29.837
You could be stuck
in a guard shack window

04:29.903 --> 04:31.439
with your ass hanging out.

04:31.505 --> 04:33.106
Dawson showed you
that picture?

04:33.173 --> 04:35.242
Yeah, it's his screensaver.

04:43.150 --> 04:44.952
There he is.

04:52.192 --> 04:53.561
Hey, baby.

04:53.627 --> 04:54.862
Oh.

04:54.928 --> 04:56.464
( Sighs )

05:02.570 --> 05:04.171
It's been what? A year?
( Chuckles )

05:04.237 --> 05:06.073
I was starting to think she
traded you in for a new model.

05:06.139 --> 05:07.641
Oh, no.
( Laughs )

05:07.708 --> 05:09.477
This one hit the lottery
on the first spin.

05:09.543 --> 05:11.745
( Laughs )

05:11.812 --> 05:14.948
More like a scratch-off
when you --

05:15.015 --> 05:17.818
when you win 5 bucks
and you don't cash it in

05:17.885 --> 05:20.654
'cause it ain't worth it.
Oh, yeah.

05:20.721 --> 05:23.123
But still you won.
You did win.
Not really.

05:23.190 --> 05:24.758
These two, huh?

05:24.825 --> 05:26.827
Anyway, you guys doing
any business in the area?

05:26.894 --> 05:28.596
We have some potential
buyers lined up.

05:28.662 --> 05:30.598
Yeah, which is why we were
thinking that maybe --

05:30.664 --> 05:33.033
Domingo, I'm sorry.
What is that?

05:33.100 --> 05:34.868
I see the two patties,
but what's in between there?

05:34.935 --> 05:36.003
Is that cheese or an egg?

05:36.069 --> 05:37.838
Both. With two hash browns
on top.

05:37.905 --> 05:39.373
-What?
-Yeah.

05:39.440 --> 05:42.543
Um, sweetheart. Domingo
was about to tell us --

05:42.610 --> 05:45.178
Now was that a special order
or did you just --

05:45.245 --> 05:46.947
Did you order that
off the menu?

05:47.014 --> 05:48.616
It's the breakfast burger.
It's on the second page.

05:48.682 --> 05:50.183
And the egg doesn't drip
on your hands?

05:50.250 --> 05:52.119
Nope, hash brown soaks it
right up.

05:52.185 --> 05:55.122
Wow, that's thought out.
It's thought out.
Okay, all right. Okay.

05:55.188 --> 05:56.890
Are we done with
the burger talk?
Yes, sorry.

05:56.957 --> 05:58.225
Are we done? Okay.

05:58.291 --> 06:00.193
So I'm sorry, please.
Continue.

06:00.260 --> 06:02.062
Uh, no problem.
Actually, this week--

06:02.129 --> 06:03.464
I'm sorry. I gotta stop --
I gotta stop this.

06:03.531 --> 06:04.998
You know what it is? I just --

06:05.065 --> 06:07.868
I tried to go healthy,
but it's just --
it's not workin'.

06:07.935 --> 06:08.969
I'm traveling and stuff.

06:09.036 --> 06:10.237
You know, I'm gonna
start Monday.

06:10.303 --> 06:11.672
I'll start Monday.
Hey, waitress? Can I get --

06:11.739 --> 06:13.140
Honey, honey, honey, honey.
Huh?

06:13.206 --> 06:14.942
You keep interrupting people,
and they're trying to tell us

06:15.008 --> 06:16.376
where they're going
for the weekend.

06:16.444 --> 06:18.345
And I wanna hear all about it,
but I will hear much better

06:18.412 --> 06:19.880
with the breakfast burger.

06:19.947 --> 06:22.983
Two meals, one bun.
I'll be locked on.

06:23.050 --> 06:24.485
Okay, excuse me, waitress.

06:24.552 --> 06:26.286
Could you fly in one of these
for my husband?

06:26.353 --> 06:29.423
I'll pay you
a million dollars. Thanks
so much. Okay. Sorry.

06:29.490 --> 06:30.991
I like this guy. You know what
it is about him?

06:31.058 --> 06:32.225
He's got an appetite for life.

06:32.292 --> 06:34.995
Yes, life.
That's what he's been eating.

06:36.664 --> 06:39.266
So, you were saying where you
were going for the weekend.

06:39.332 --> 06:41.401
Yeah, Boston. We're having
a big art show this weekend.

06:41.469 --> 06:43.737
Oh, Boston.
It's gonna be kind of nice.
I thought maybe --

06:43.804 --> 06:45.238
( Cellphone chiming )

06:45.305 --> 06:47.407
Excuse me.

06:47.475 --> 06:50.310
Oh. Give me one second.

06:50.377 --> 06:52.412
What is it?

06:52.480 --> 06:54.414
I thought you told me
it was handled.

06:56.083 --> 06:58.752
I'm sorry. We gotta run.
It's business.

06:58.819 --> 07:00.788
-Sorry, it's just...
-No, no. Don't worry.

07:00.854 --> 07:02.456
But I'll see you guys soon.
Okay.

07:02.523 --> 07:03.791
-Yes, you got it.
-All right, bye.

07:03.857 --> 07:07.194
All right.
What is the matter with you?

07:08.729 --> 07:10.631
What?

07:10.698 --> 07:11.932
I am try--

07:11.999 --> 07:14.201
I'm gonna eat around
the bite marks.

07:14.267 --> 07:18.405
No! I am trying to get
information,

07:18.472 --> 07:20.974
and you are yapping about
your burger!

07:21.041 --> 07:22.676
I'm trying to make things
look natural.

07:22.743 --> 07:24.211
It's called police work.
( Scoffs )

07:24.277 --> 07:25.646
And what about you?

07:25.713 --> 07:28.381
"Hey, can you tell us where
your crime is going down?

07:28.448 --> 07:30.984
"And if you wouldn't mind,
speak into the tiny microphone

07:31.051 --> 07:33.220
in my blouse.
That'd be super. I like it."

07:36.724 --> 07:38.058
Come on.

07:42.229 --> 07:44.231
You got problems,
you know that?
Oh, I got problems?

07:44.297 --> 07:46.033
Yeah. ( Under breath )
I told you
this was a bad idea.

07:46.099 --> 07:48.235
It's a very good idea.
I got us the information
we need.

07:48.301 --> 07:49.503
All right, you have
your own mic, stupid!
Get over.

07:49.570 --> 07:50.571
Boston. It's Boston.

07:52.472 --> 07:53.774
You know what else I got?

07:53.841 --> 07:55.408
I got two burgers,
I got a vanilla malt,

07:55.475 --> 07:56.677
and a salad for my wife.

07:56.744 --> 07:58.712
By the way, we got a pretty
big tab out here,

07:58.779 --> 08:00.781
so if you can run out
a debit card.

08:03.350 --> 08:05.318
I scoped out your rezzie,
checked some refs,

08:05.385 --> 08:07.020
noodled around
on your app submish,

08:07.087 --> 08:08.488
and I'm just gonna come out
and say it --

08:08.556 --> 08:11.124
I want you here at Nozzler.

08:11.191 --> 08:14.995
Uh, I appreciate that, Parker,
but, uh,

08:15.062 --> 08:17.464
I am an entrepreneur myself...
( Thud )

08:17.531 --> 08:21.068
and I'm not sure
that I would be comfortable

08:21.134 --> 08:23.771
being a spoke in a wheel.

08:23.837 --> 08:26.273
My dream is to be the wheel.

08:26.339 --> 08:27.775
Hear it, respect it.

08:27.841 --> 08:29.009
In fact, you know who said
the same thing

08:29.076 --> 08:30.544
about six months ago?

08:31.712 --> 08:34.147
Little dreamer named
Parker Cohen. Yeah.

08:34.214 --> 08:36.349
And now I'm about to take
this baby public.

08:36.416 --> 08:37.885
Oh, wow. That's amazing.

08:37.951 --> 08:39.853
Yeah. And that's when
we decide to break open

08:39.920 --> 08:41.622
this 50-year-old
bottle of scotch.

08:41.689 --> 08:43.390
I don't wanna tell you
how much I paid for it,
but I'm gonna.

08:43.456 --> 08:44.858
$27,000.

08:44.925 --> 08:47.027
Oh, wow.
That is a lot of money.

08:47.094 --> 08:48.328
Yes, it is.

08:48.395 --> 08:50.197
So here's the offer.

08:50.263 --> 08:52.933
Six figs, stock options,
piece of everything
we develop,

08:53.000 --> 08:54.635
plus...

08:54.702 --> 08:56.837
we rent out Six Flags
for our company retreat.

08:56.904 --> 08:58.505
( Exhales )

08:58.572 --> 09:01.341
I do love the log flume.

09:01.408 --> 09:05.345
And here, a little cinnamon
on your breadstick.

09:05.412 --> 09:07.581
A signing bonus.

09:08.649 --> 09:10.584
$10,000?

09:10.651 --> 09:12.252
What do you say, Chale?

09:12.319 --> 09:14.221
Wanna flume to the moon?

09:18.391 --> 09:20.260
Hey, you know where
my socks are?

09:20.327 --> 09:22.129
Wow.

09:22.195 --> 09:24.164
That is quite the statement.

09:26.399 --> 09:27.801
Yeah, where, uh,
where are my Met socks?

09:27.868 --> 09:29.036
I need 'em for Fantasy Camp.

09:29.102 --> 09:30.638
Why can't you just wear
the socks you have on?

09:30.704 --> 09:31.805
That's a great idea.

09:31.872 --> 09:33.106
So when they divide up
teams down there,

09:33.173 --> 09:34.908
they'll be like, "Okay,
uh, we'll take the dude

09:34.975 --> 09:36.176
"with the eye patch.

09:36.243 --> 09:39.647
You can have the sad guy
with the regular socks."

09:41.181 --> 09:42.750
That's cute
that you think socks

09:42.816 --> 09:45.418
are the reason
you get picked last.

09:45.485 --> 09:47.587
I've worked for 20 years
for this moment.

09:47.655 --> 09:49.556
I wanna look the part.
And you will,

09:49.623 --> 09:51.558
but I need your opinion
on something first, okay?

09:51.625 --> 09:52.793
-All right.
-Okay.

09:52.860 --> 09:54.194
Pick my brain.

09:54.261 --> 09:56.496
So I'm about to get
this promotion at work.
Uh-huh.

09:56.563 --> 09:58.165
I know it.
Everybody knows it.

09:58.231 --> 09:59.667
But when they make
the announcement,

09:59.733 --> 10:02.970
I wanna, like, look surprised
and then humble, you know?

10:03.036 --> 10:04.171
I've been working on it
in the mirror.

10:04.237 --> 10:06.106
So just tell me what
you think, all right?

10:06.173 --> 10:07.908
Tell me I got the promotion.

10:07.975 --> 10:10.543
"And the new...
whatever the thing is

10:10.610 --> 10:14.882
goes to...Donna Gable."

10:14.948 --> 10:16.750
( Gasps ) Wha --

10:16.817 --> 10:18.385
Oh, my G--

10:18.451 --> 10:21.822
( Gasps ) Oh.
Okay.

10:21.889 --> 10:23.490
Really?

10:23.556 --> 10:25.192
Okay.

10:26.860 --> 10:29.062
You gotta -- you gotta take it
down a notch.

10:29.129 --> 10:30.964
Really?
Your eyebrows, they're --
everything --

10:31.031 --> 10:32.399
they're all over the place.

10:32.465 --> 10:34.067
Okay, but I can't just stand
there like an idiot.

10:34.134 --> 10:35.268
I gotta do something.

10:35.335 --> 10:37.237
Just do what I do.
I go from double guns

10:37.304 --> 10:39.239
into prayer hands
under the chin.

10:39.306 --> 10:41.608
I do a face bow
out into a point.

10:41.675 --> 10:43.677
What's up?

10:43.744 --> 10:45.012
I like that.

10:45.078 --> 10:46.546
Yeah, whatever.
Where are my socks? Come on.

10:46.613 --> 10:48.281
Ooh, on top of the dryer.
Oh. Great, thanks.

10:48.348 --> 10:49.416
Wait, wait, wait.
Yeah.

10:49.482 --> 10:51.384
( Clicks tongue )

10:53.386 --> 10:54.587
Hmm?

10:54.654 --> 10:56.156
Mm.

11:00.160 --> 11:02.129
( Door closes )

11:02.195 --> 11:03.463
Hey!

11:03.530 --> 11:05.733
Okay, so...

11:05.799 --> 11:07.367
Not a good fit.

11:07.434 --> 11:09.469
Oh. Well, that's okay.

11:09.536 --> 11:12.172
It was a great fit!
( Laughs )

11:12.239 --> 11:13.974
Do you see that?
What I did there?
Yeah.

11:14.041 --> 11:17.277
Okay. Stock options,
a 6-figure salary,

11:17.344 --> 11:22.115
and a signing bonus
for $10,000.

11:22.182 --> 11:24.885
-That is unbelievable.
-Right?!

11:24.952 --> 11:27.420
-Mwah!
-Wow. Okay.

11:27.487 --> 11:30.523
So this is amazing,
because I have news, too.

11:30.590 --> 11:31.959
( Chuckles )

11:32.025 --> 11:35.295
I got accepted to my dream
school, Columbia Law.

11:35.362 --> 11:37.697
What?! That's fantastic!

11:37.765 --> 11:39.566
It's way too expensive,
but it is really cool to know

11:39.632 --> 11:40.734
that I got accepted.

11:40.801 --> 11:42.936
No, no. Look,
when Nozzler goes public,

11:43.003 --> 11:44.571
money is no longer an issue.

11:44.637 --> 11:47.507
We'll -- and this is gonna be
the best part.

11:47.574 --> 11:50.643
Seeing your father's face when
I give him this rent check.

11:50.710 --> 11:52.579
Grab your phone.
This is gonna be epic.

11:52.645 --> 11:55.816
Yes! Donna, I got 'em!
Awesome!

11:55.883 --> 11:58.752
Mr. Gable, I present to you
a rent check

11:58.819 --> 12:00.620
for six months paid in full.

12:00.687 --> 12:02.355
Thank you very much.

12:13.867 --> 12:15.335
-To Fantasy Camp, huh?
-Yeah.

12:15.402 --> 12:16.469
-Come on.
-Fantasy camp, baby.

12:16.536 --> 12:18.872
-Whoo!
-Going to Mets Camp, are ya?

12:18.939 --> 12:20.407
That's always been a dream
of mine.

12:20.473 --> 12:22.009
You know, I played
Minor League ball.

12:22.075 --> 12:23.276
I had no idea.

12:23.343 --> 12:25.078
Yeah, yeah. If you ever showed
a little interest

12:25.145 --> 12:27.781
in my personal life,
I probably would've told ya.

12:27.848 --> 12:30.951
Uh, well, hey,
have a great trip.

12:32.185 --> 12:34.087
Hey, Enzo.
Yeah?

12:34.154 --> 12:35.989
Wait a second.

12:36.056 --> 12:37.891
This was supposed to have
meatball on it.

12:37.958 --> 12:40.293
I just want to make sure.

12:40.360 --> 12:42.963
Yeah, whatever. You know
what I'm talkin' about.

12:44.064 --> 12:46.967
Whoa! Cellucci.

12:47.034 --> 12:48.969
What are you doing here?
We gotta see Domingo again.

12:49.036 --> 12:52.105
What?
Yes, at his apartment
right now.

12:52.172 --> 12:54.141
No, I can't. We're going to
Mets Fantasy Camp.

12:54.207 --> 12:57.878
Oh, now you're just
twisting the knife now.

12:57.945 --> 13:00.247
No, tonight we got the
"Good 'N Plenty Barbecue"

13:00.313 --> 13:03.083
with Doc Gooden and then
we got drinks on the piazza.

13:03.150 --> 13:04.952
Let me guess --
with Mike Piazza?

13:05.018 --> 13:06.786
No, Tim Teufel.

13:06.854 --> 13:08.822
Look, this case
is on the 1 yard line.

13:08.889 --> 13:10.891
I just need you for one hour.
Tops.

13:10.958 --> 13:13.460
One hour, all right?
I'll meet you guys at JFK.

13:13.526 --> 13:15.495
Kyle, grab my luggage.

13:17.597 --> 13:19.599
Hey.

13:19.666 --> 13:21.134
The massage is almost over.

13:21.201 --> 13:22.970
Stella just has to
crack my feet.

13:23.036 --> 13:24.337
Gonna be a few minutes.

13:24.404 --> 13:25.772
No problem, Domingo.

13:25.839 --> 13:28.942
If you don't care
of your feet, who will?

13:29.009 --> 13:30.911
I love my feet.
( Laughs )

13:30.978 --> 13:32.445
I'll be back.
Yeah, good to know.

13:32.512 --> 13:34.347
I like your feet.

13:34.414 --> 13:35.849
( Lowered voice )
What are you doing?
Are you out of your mind?

13:35.916 --> 13:37.150
I got a flight to catch
in an hour.

13:37.217 --> 13:38.418
( Lowered voice )
Okay. I'm sorry.

13:38.485 --> 13:39.786
Why don't
I just waltz in there

13:39.853 --> 13:41.521
and tell a half-naked
crime lord,

13:41.588 --> 13:44.858
"Uh, my fake husband
has to get on a plane
to Florida

13:44.925 --> 13:47.094
to play grab-ass with
his stupid friends!"?

13:47.160 --> 13:48.862
And some retired Mets. There's
a lot of people down there.

13:48.929 --> 13:51.198
It's big event.
It's a big event.

13:51.264 --> 13:52.599
You're unbelievable,
you know that?

13:52.665 --> 13:54.434
You worm your way into my case
and now you wanna tell me,

13:54.501 --> 13:55.702
you wanna tell me --
Whoa, wait a second.

13:55.768 --> 13:57.070
Wait a second. Your case?
Yeah.

13:57.137 --> 13:58.771
Okay -- this is my case!

13:58.838 --> 14:00.874
( Scoffs )
I didn't worm my way
into anything.

14:00.941 --> 14:03.276
Believe me, they called me
in here because someone

14:03.343 --> 14:05.879
was droppin' the ball.
Oh, yeah. You.

14:05.946 --> 14:07.480
Wow.
Don't --

14:07.547 --> 14:08.982
Wow.
No, no, no, don't you do it.

14:09.049 --> 14:10.483
Don't "wow"?
Yeah, don't do --
You don't "wow" me.

14:10.550 --> 14:11.618
Wow.
You don't "wow" me.

14:11.684 --> 14:13.186
Wow.
I "wow" you. I "wow" --

14:13.253 --> 14:14.421
Oh, you "wow" me?
Yeah, yeah, I "wow" you.

14:14.487 --> 14:15.822
You "wow" me? Well, listen!

14:15.889 --> 14:18.191
I am this close
to solving this case.

14:18.258 --> 14:19.626
Don't screw it up.

14:19.692 --> 14:21.328
Okay, okay, can you lower
your voice, please?

14:21.394 --> 14:22.762
'Cause it is booming!

14:22.829 --> 14:24.664
Shut...up!

14:24.731 --> 14:26.533
The place could be bugged.

14:28.168 --> 14:29.369
( Sighs )

14:31.371 --> 14:33.073
No, look around, dummy.

14:33.140 --> 14:34.307
I am looking.
Look with your eyes!
Oh!

14:34.374 --> 14:36.243
That's how you look.
Shut up!

14:38.511 --> 14:39.879
Hey, I got it.

14:41.148 --> 14:43.016
-The giraffe.
-Okay --

14:45.285 --> 14:47.287
You don't say "giraffe."

14:47.354 --> 14:49.856
You point to the giraffe.
You point to it.

14:49.923 --> 14:51.858
You just said it twice.
Oh, my God! Just --

14:51.925 --> 14:53.260
Check the stupid giraffe.

14:53.326 --> 14:54.827
You said -- That's three
times right there.
Okay, okay!

14:54.894 --> 14:56.663
Fine! ( Mutters )

15:03.136 --> 15:04.504
Crap!

15:09.009 --> 15:10.477
Hey.
Hey.

15:10.543 --> 15:11.911
When did we get there?

15:11.979 --> 15:15.215
Oh, it's just a little thing
I picked up yesterday.

15:15.282 --> 15:17.417
I know you enjoy
the occasional cappuccino

15:17.484 --> 15:19.052
to put a little pep
in your step.

15:19.119 --> 15:24.724
Oh, Chale, you shouldn't have.
Those things are so expensive.

15:24.791 --> 15:26.426
But since you did,
let's put some cinnamon

15:26.493 --> 15:28.495
in this mamma jamma, huh?
( Chuckles )

15:28.561 --> 15:30.763
Um, hey, babe.

15:30.830 --> 15:32.365
Did you buy this for me?

15:32.432 --> 15:35.768
Oh, uh, I'm not really good
with purses.
Is that a good one?

15:35.835 --> 15:39.539
Um, that's a Coach bag.
That's like 400 bucks.

15:39.606 --> 15:41.508
Eh...Mm.

15:41.574 --> 15:43.210
What?

15:43.276 --> 15:46.313
Wow. I've been married
20 years

15:46.379 --> 15:49.716
and I'm walking around
with an Assistant Coach bag.

15:49.782 --> 15:52.319
Ah. I'm not familiar
with that brand.

15:52.385 --> 15:55.989
Kevin got it for me at
the Tri County Flea Market.

15:56.056 --> 16:01.628
Um, he got that
and my Alvin Klein luggage.

16:01.694 --> 16:04.964
Whoa. Wait, babe,
there's $200 in here.

16:05.032 --> 16:06.333
Huh?

16:06.399 --> 16:08.468
Eh, I just wanted you
to have a good day.

16:08.535 --> 16:09.802
( Chuckles )
( Gasps )

16:09.869 --> 16:11.938
I feel like a mob wife.

16:12.005 --> 16:13.506
In a good way.

16:13.573 --> 16:16.109
Oh, Chale, you might wanna
pump the brakes a little bit.

16:16.176 --> 16:18.711
Look, I'm just trying
to show everyone

16:18.778 --> 16:20.180
how much I appreciate them.

16:20.247 --> 16:22.282
It's not -- oh.
I almost forgot.

16:22.349 --> 16:23.816
Jackie!

16:25.018 --> 16:27.654
-Yeah?
-Here's a few slices
of cheddar

16:27.720 --> 16:30.190
for you to get
that video game.

16:30.257 --> 16:32.192
I am diggin' rich Chale!

16:32.259 --> 16:34.194
( Chale chuckles )

16:34.261 --> 16:36.696
In this house,
money buys affection.

16:36.763 --> 16:39.966
Don't hate the player,
hate the game.

16:40.033 --> 16:41.434
What the hell did you do?

16:41.501 --> 16:42.935
I barely touched it,
all right?

16:43.002 --> 16:44.771
It was halfway
falling off already.
Well, then fix it!

16:44.837 --> 16:47.707
Okay, let me just get out
my ceramic giraffe repair kit.

16:47.774 --> 16:49.842
I need something sticky.

16:49.909 --> 16:51.044
Give me some gum.
Give me some gum.

16:51.111 --> 16:52.212
I don't even think
I have any.

16:52.279 --> 16:53.580
Oh, please.
You're from Massapequa.

16:53.646 --> 16:55.982
Your name's Vanessa Cellucci.
You got gum.

16:57.117 --> 16:59.719
Come on. Hurry up.

17:01.121 --> 17:03.423
( Chewing rapidly )

17:12.999 --> 17:14.234
What flavor is this?

17:14.301 --> 17:15.868
( Mouth full )
Passion bubble.

17:15.935 --> 17:18.238
Passion bubble?
What are you, 12?
( Groans )

17:18.305 --> 17:20.073
Domingo: Be right out, guys!
Just putting on pants.

17:20.140 --> 17:21.374
Oh, no rush!

17:21.441 --> 17:23.210
( Lowered voice )
Hurry up.
I'm hurrying.

17:25.545 --> 17:26.979
Okay, give me...

17:27.046 --> 17:28.415
Not enough. Give me some more.
Give me more.

17:28.481 --> 17:30.083
It's not sticky enough.
Come on.

17:30.150 --> 17:31.851
Okay, just give me your gum.
Give me -- oh, it's so gross.

17:31.918 --> 17:34.521
Oh, it's like
a river in there.
All right, shut up!

17:35.888 --> 17:38.225
Hey.
Thank you so much for waiting.

17:38.291 --> 17:39.826
( Singsongy )
Who wants drinks?

17:39.892 --> 17:42.095
Oh, you know what?
I think we're good,

17:42.162 --> 17:44.063
because we're in a bit
of a time crunch, so...

17:44.131 --> 17:45.998
All right, well,
let's get into it.

17:46.065 --> 17:48.768
This weekend is our biggest
art show in Boston.

17:48.835 --> 17:51.371
We thought maybe we could
do some business there.

17:51.438 --> 17:53.173
We would --
we would love that.

17:53.240 --> 17:56.176
Perfect. So it's settled.
You're coming tomorrow.
Boston.

17:56.243 --> 17:58.845
Oh, snag. No, no, I mean,
I can't make it this weekend,

17:58.911 --> 18:01.214
but I think you can,
right, hon?
Yes, I can.

18:01.281 --> 18:02.782
Oh, there you go.
It's gonna be great.

18:02.849 --> 18:04.684
And Boston's such
an awesome town, right?

18:04.751 --> 18:07.220
( Boston accent ) "Hey, Tommy,
did you touch
Bobby's lobster?"

18:07.287 --> 18:09.389
"I did not touch
Bobby's lobster.

18:09.456 --> 18:12.058
Bobby touched
his own lobster."

18:12.125 --> 18:13.526
( Laughs )

18:13.593 --> 18:15.528
( Normal voice )
It's a great city.

18:15.595 --> 18:18.498
No, no, we'll all go together.
We'll make it
a couples weekend.

18:18.565 --> 18:19.932
Yes!

18:19.999 --> 18:21.634
Oh, you know, I'd love to,
Domingo.

18:21.701 --> 18:23.903
But I gotta throw you
a "no can do."

18:23.970 --> 18:25.905
Uh, honey. ( Chuckles )

18:25.972 --> 18:29.342
I think the -- the doctor
can look at that rash anytime.

18:29.409 --> 18:31.944
Mm. That's not true,
because I called them

18:32.011 --> 18:33.546
and they wouldn't move
my appointment.
Mm.

18:33.613 --> 18:34.981
And it's pretty irritating.

18:35.047 --> 18:37.083
Yeah, he can move
the appointment.
He can't.

18:37.150 --> 18:38.685
He'll be there.

18:38.751 --> 18:40.587
I'm not gonna be there
so I'm not gonna make it.
He'll be there.

18:40.653 --> 18:42.155
He's gonna be there.
Sorry, I'm not gonna make it.
Sorry. I can't do it. Nope.

18:42.222 --> 18:44.591
Not having you both there
would be
a major disappointment.

18:44.657 --> 18:47.160
You know what?

18:47.227 --> 18:48.995
Maybe this isn't
the right fit.

18:51.598 --> 18:53.132
All right, you know what?

18:53.200 --> 18:54.834
You won this,
my little care bear.

18:54.901 --> 18:55.935
You won this one.

19:01.174 --> 19:02.509
She kicked the table.
I saw her --

19:02.575 --> 19:04.311
Why would you do that?

19:07.714 --> 19:11.784
( Cellphone rings )

19:11.851 --> 19:13.486
Oh, come on.
Don't do this to me.

19:13.553 --> 19:15.121
I don't wanna know what's
going on down there.

19:15.188 --> 19:17.123
Drinking beers
with Mookie Wilson!

19:17.190 --> 19:18.858
Mookie! Ahh!
( Laughing )

19:18.925 --> 19:20.660
Oh, come on.
That should be me!

19:20.727 --> 19:21.928
Hey, if it makes you feel
any better,

19:21.994 --> 19:23.563
I'm having a hell of a time.
Enzo!

19:23.630 --> 19:25.865
Enzo!
Enzo's down there?!

19:25.932 --> 19:27.634
I taught Mike Piazza
how to make a calzone.

19:27.700 --> 19:30.403
Tomorrow, he's treating us all
to spray tans.

19:30.470 --> 19:33.373
Except me. ( Laughs )
( Laughter )

19:36.343 --> 19:39.011
Hey, babe. How you doin'?
I'm missing everything.

19:39.078 --> 19:42.282
Oh, yeah.
But on the bright side,

19:42.349 --> 19:44.484
you get to spend a night
in Boston.

19:44.551 --> 19:45.852
You could do your whole...

19:45.918 --> 19:49.822
( Boston accent ) "Did you
touch Tommy's lobster?" bit.

19:49.889 --> 19:52.692
I already did it at Domingo's.
It crushed.

19:52.759 --> 19:54.861
I got nothing to look
forward to.

19:54.927 --> 19:56.296
I tell you what I'm doing.
I'm going to Wahlburgers.

19:56.363 --> 19:58.064
That's what's happening.

19:58.130 --> 20:02.034
Hey, you know, it's obvious
that they need you

20:02.101 --> 20:03.470
to solve this case.

20:03.536 --> 20:04.871
Okay, that's not true.

20:04.937 --> 20:07.206
Why else would they pull a guy
out of retirement

20:07.274 --> 20:09.642
unless he's essential?

20:09.709 --> 20:11.511
You know...

20:11.578 --> 20:13.780
You know, I do --

20:13.846 --> 20:16.783
I have abilities that a lot
of the other guys, they --

20:16.849 --> 20:19.552
they just don't have, and...

20:19.619 --> 20:22.255
He's useless.

20:22.322 --> 20:25.592
I'm actually the centerpiece
of this whole case.

20:25.658 --> 20:28.928
Maybe we'll get lucky
and he'll get food poisoning.

20:30.563 --> 20:33.333
Hey, maybe I'll even
win a medal.

20:33.400 --> 20:35.602
Some kind of like civilian
thing for coming in

20:35.668 --> 20:37.236
at the last minute there.

20:37.304 --> 20:39.439
Yeah, and you know what?
You would deserve it.

20:39.506 --> 20:42.709
He is such a moron.

20:42.775 --> 20:45.478
Donna, you married
a good man.

20:47.814 --> 20:50.583
Sometimes I lose
sight of that. Thank you.
Thank you.

20:50.650 --> 20:52.452
Mm. Ahh.

20:57.023 --> 21:00.327
* Don't want
no sweet perfume *

21:00.393 --> 21:03.863
* Shake your thing,
go bust your move *

21:03.930 --> 21:06.065
* Do, do, do, do, do

21:06.132 --> 21:07.600
* Do, do, do, do

21:07.667 --> 21:11.203
* Ohhhhhh, yeah

21:11.270 --> 21:14.273
* Don't want
no high-heel shoes *

21:14.341 --> 21:16.909
* I just don't want no...
