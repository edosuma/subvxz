00:43.000 --> 00:46.000
Hi. What seems to be the trouble?

00:46.200 --> 00:48.800
I lost my kitty. He's up there.

00:48.900 --> 00:50.800
In the tree, huh?

00:51.400 --> 00:52.900
Oh, yeah, there he is.

00:53.800 --> 00:55.900
Boy, he's up there high.

01:00.000 --> 01:01.900
I wouldn't worry about him.
He'll be fine.

01:02.200 --> 01:04.099
He'll probably come down
in a couple days.

01:04.300 --> 01:07.200
Cats like to climb trees.
They're good at it.

01:07.400 --> 01:10.000
He'll get hungry,
and he'll come down and see you.

01:10.400 --> 01:12.600
Don't cry.

01:13.300 --> 01:16.300
- What's the cat's name?
- Fluffy.

01:16.500 --> 01:18.200
Fluffy, huh?

01:24.000 --> 01:25.600
Okay.

01:25.900 --> 01:27.500
Fluffy.

01:28.400 --> 01:29.400
Come here, Fluffy.

01:42.500 --> 01:44.600
I'll be right down.

01:51.300 --> 01:53.200
Okay. All right.

01:53.900 --> 01:55.400
Yeah.

01:56.700 --> 01:58.700
Come on, Fluffy.

01:59.100 --> 02:00.800
Fluffy.

02:03.800 --> 02:05.100
Hello, Fluffy.

02:05.300 --> 02:07.800
Come on. Come on, Fluffy.

02:16.100 --> 02:17.400
Here you go.

02:17.600 --> 02:18.900
Come on, Fluffy.

02:19.100 --> 02:20.600
Atta-Fluffy.

02:20.800 --> 02:22.500
Yeah, Fluffy.

02:25.200 --> 02:28.100
Hey, I got him.

02:32.600 --> 02:34.700
Oh, my God.

02:34.900 --> 02:37.100
Don't move. Would you quit moving?

02:37.300 --> 02:38.400
Come on, don't do that.

02:38.600 --> 02:40.100
Don't do that.

02:49.200 --> 02:51.000
You wanna hurry up?

02:53.500 --> 02:55.900
Come on, this cat's nervous.

04:49.000 --> 04:50.600
That's far enough.

04:54.300 --> 04:55.500
Get up. Get up.

04:56.700 --> 04:58.000
- Get against the car!
- Easy!

04:58.300 --> 05:00.000
- Don't move.
- I'm a cop.

05:02.800 --> 05:04.700
- Mel, what are you doing?
- Jesus, Frank.

05:04.900 --> 05:07.000
You almost killed me.
Would you take it easy?

05:07.200 --> 05:10.100
Well, I'm very sorry. You wanna
explain what you're doing here?

05:11.900 --> 05:13.800
Hello, Rizzo.

05:14.100 --> 05:15.700
What are you doing?

05:17.600 --> 05:18.800
I'll give you one guess.

05:20.100 --> 05:21.800
Stealing television sets?

05:22.000 --> 05:24.000
Hey, he's not as dumb
as he looks, huh?

05:24.300 --> 05:27.700
Bite the bag, Rizzo.
Your ass is grass.

05:28.200 --> 05:30.700
Frank, take the TV set.

05:30.900 --> 05:32.900
Let's get the hell out of here.

05:33.700 --> 05:35.300
I already own a TV set.

05:36.400 --> 05:37.700
Frank.

05:38.000 --> 05:39.200
Think about it, Frank.

05:39.500 --> 05:42.400
You take the goddamn TV set
and keep your big mouth shut.

05:51.300 --> 05:52.800
Internal Affairs. Don't move.

05:53.000 --> 05:55.200
- Freeze.
- It's okay.

05:55.400 --> 05:57.600
It's okay, boys. We got him covered.

05:57.800 --> 06:00.400
- Hey, this ain't mine.
- Sorry, Frank.

06:00.600 --> 06:02.000
It is now.

06:04.500 --> 06:08.100
This court looks upon corruption
with great disdain.

06:09.300 --> 06:10.900
You should be ashamed of yourself...

06:11.100 --> 06:14.000
...for betraying the trust
and responsibility...

06:14.200 --> 06:15.600
...that was placed upon you.

06:15.900 --> 06:18.700
Do you have anything
to say for yourself, officer?

06:19.300 --> 06:21.500
I'm sorry. Mr. Dooley.

06:21.700 --> 06:23.000
I didn't do it, Your Honor.

06:23.200 --> 06:26.300
Your Honor, given the fact
that Officer Dooley...

06:26.500 --> 06:29.300
...has been fined and dismissed
by the police department...

06:29.700 --> 06:33.100
...the state feels it is appropriate
to move for dismissal.

06:33.700 --> 06:36.400
All right, but I don't like it.

06:37.400 --> 06:39.700
Motion granted. Dismissed.

06:39.900 --> 06:42.800
- Next case.
- Call prisoner Lawrence Lupik.

06:53.800 --> 06:55.200
Thank you very much. Thank you.

06:55.500 --> 06:57.500
Made my day, really. Thank you.

07:04.400 --> 07:07.800
- Is the defense counsel present?
- Here, Your Honor.

07:10.400 --> 07:13.500
In case number 867810,
the defendant is charged...

07:13.800 --> 07:16.100
...with three counts
of breaking and entering...

07:16.400 --> 07:18.400
...five counts of armed robbery...

07:18.600 --> 07:20.400
...three counts of kidnapping--

07:21.000 --> 07:22.900
- Right on.
- Order in the court...

07:23.100 --> 07:24.800
...or I'll have you all removed.

07:25.000 --> 07:26.700
-one count of extortion...

07:26.900 --> 07:29.700
...two counts of aggravated assault
with a deadly weapon...

07:29.900 --> 07:32.700
...and five counts of assault
with the intent to kill.

07:32.900 --> 07:34.700
Mr. Lupik, how do you plead?

07:37.400 --> 07:39.000
Your Honor, I--

07:39.300 --> 07:42.700
If I go to jail, I'll kill you.

07:48.600 --> 07:49.900
It's good.

07:51.200 --> 07:54.200
Your Honor,
may I approach the bench?

07:54.600 --> 07:56.100
Well, if you must.

08:08.600 --> 08:11.200
Your Honor, I'm prepared to plead
Mr. Lupik guilty...

08:11.500 --> 08:14.900
...on the armed robbery charge, if the
people will reduce the assaults...

08:15.100 --> 08:18.600
...to resisting arrest
and agree to suspend sentence.

08:18.800 --> 08:21.600
What about kidnapping
and extortion?

08:23.500 --> 08:25.400
He didn't mean it, Your Honor.

08:25.600 --> 08:28.000
You call that plea-bargaining?

08:28.300 --> 08:30.300
Where the hell
did you go to law school?

08:30.900 --> 08:35.700
I just feel that a long prison sentence
is not warranted in this case.

08:35.900 --> 08:39.299
The police found rugs in his
apartment made out of human hair.

08:39.600 --> 08:42.900
Well, bad taste is not a crime,
Your Honor...

08:43.100 --> 08:44.900
...last time I checked
the statutes.

08:46.800 --> 08:51.700
Your Honor, I feel this whole thing
falls under a sociopsychological...

08:51.900 --> 08:54.100
...you know, kind of umbrella.

08:54.300 --> 08:58.600
I sincerely feel that the facts are
completely irrelevant in this case.

09:07.100 --> 09:10.600
Let me put it this way. He says
if he goes to jail, he's gonna kill me.

09:10.900 --> 09:13.400
I don't usually believe
every psychopath I defend...

09:13.600 --> 09:14.900
...but I believe this guy.

09:15.100 --> 09:18.900
Mr. Kane, you are without a doubt
one of the worst lawyers I've ever seen.

09:19.100 --> 09:20.500
Then I move for a mistrial.

09:20.700 --> 09:22.300
- Shut up.
- Yes, sir.

09:22.600 --> 09:24.900
Furthermore, it's obvious to me...

09:25.100 --> 09:27.300
...that you're having
some sort of a breakdown.

09:27.500 --> 09:29.500
So this is what I suggest:

09:30.100 --> 09:33.100
You plead your client guilty
on all counts...

09:33.300 --> 09:35.300
...and I'll give him a sentence
so long...

09:35.500 --> 09:38.900
...he won't even remember
his own name, let alone yours.

09:39.500 --> 09:43.400
Then you promise to find
a new line of work for yourself...

09:43.600 --> 09:45.600
...with a lot less responsibility,
okay?

09:45.800 --> 09:47.600
Yes, sir. Thank you.

09:54.800 --> 09:56.700
The world is a shithole...

09:56.900 --> 09:59.500
...full of shitty little scumbags
who are scared shitless.

09:59.900 --> 10:02.200
- With dedication...
- You think he's a little anal?

10:02.400 --> 10:03.700
I think he's right.

10:03.900 --> 10:06.900
Now, this badge
will lift you out of that scum...

10:07.100 --> 10:10.000
...into a $12-billion-a-year industry.

10:10.200 --> 10:12.900
My name is Captain O'Connell...

10:13.100 --> 10:16.300
...and I welcome you
to the world of private security.

10:21.300 --> 10:22.600
Any questions?

10:23.700 --> 10:25.100
Yeah?

10:26.300 --> 10:29.200
You mean we're gonna actually earn
$12 billion a year?

10:32.400 --> 10:35.700
No, you're gonna earn
$4.60 an hour.

10:35.900 --> 10:37.700
Which is starting pay for everyone...

10:37.900 --> 10:42.600
...regardless of age, sex,
race, color or intelligence.

10:42.800 --> 10:46.200
- You work 10 hours, you make $46.
- Now let me get this straight.

10:46.400 --> 10:49.100
If you wanted to work, say,
3 billion hours...

10:49.400 --> 10:52.400
...I could roughly pull in
over $12 billion...

10:52.700 --> 10:54.900
...if I was eager enough
and put the time in?

10:56.700 --> 10:58.900
- Any more questions?
- Yes.

10:59.100 --> 11:00.500
Where it says "name"--?

11:00.700 --> 11:03.800
Look. Here on the application.

11:04.000 --> 11:07.000
Do I put my name?

11:07.200 --> 11:09.900
- Yeah.
- Oh, thank you, sir.

11:10.100 --> 11:12.700
Where it says "police record,"
does that mean felonies...

11:12.900 --> 11:15.700
- ...or misdemeanors?
- Both.

11:15.900 --> 11:18.600
Can I write on the back?
I don't think I'm gonna have room.

11:19.300 --> 11:21.900
We got lots of extra paper
if you need it.

11:22.100 --> 11:25.400
You all had a chance to read the
booklet "Careers in Private Security."

11:25.600 --> 11:28.500
You look like a guy who
defended me on an assault charge.

11:28.700 --> 11:30.200
Oh, really? Did you get off?

11:30.500 --> 11:32.700
- I got three years.
- There are two functions...

11:32.900 --> 11:34.900
- No, wasn't me.
- ...for a security guard.

11:35.200 --> 11:40.000
Excuse me, I'm gonna stand up
and stretch the old legs.

11:40.200 --> 11:42.300
But no matter what you do...

11:42.500 --> 11:46.800
...your primary responsibility
is always the same:

11:47.000 --> 11:49.200
To observe and report.

11:49.400 --> 11:52.100
But should you witness
a crime or violation...

11:52.300 --> 11:54.300
Interesting group of people.

11:54.500 --> 11:56.800
- Yeah, to Freud, maybe.
- However...

11:57.000 --> 11:59.100
- ...you can detain somebody...
- Norman Kane.

11:59.300 --> 12:01.600
- ...and use force if necessary...
- Frank Dooley.

12:01.800 --> 12:04.800
...until the police arrive.
Any questions?

12:05.000 --> 12:06.300
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

12:07.300 --> 12:09.200
Let's say somebody lying, right?

12:09.400 --> 12:11.000
And you know they lying.

12:11.200 --> 12:13.000
- Can you shoot them?
- Well, it depends.

12:13.200 --> 12:14.800
- Use your own judgment.
- Thank you.

12:15.000 --> 12:16.800
- I appreciate that.
- Other questions?

12:17.000 --> 12:20.900
Yes, I have a question
concerning our powers of arrest.

12:21.100 --> 12:24.900
The statutes governing
citizen's arrest really aren't very clear.

12:25.200 --> 12:27.900
Will we be indemnified
by the company against lawsuits...

12:28.100 --> 12:31.700
...or prosecution resulting
from wrongful arrest complaints?

12:32.000 --> 12:33.800
What are you, a lawyer?

12:35.300 --> 12:37.100
No. No.

12:39.200 --> 12:41.200
No. No, what I mean to say is...

12:41.400 --> 12:44.300
...if I detain a shoplifter,
and he turns out to be innocent...

12:44.700 --> 12:47.500
...and he sues me
for a million dollars...

12:47.700 --> 12:50.200
- ...what happens?
- What happens?

12:50.400 --> 12:52.900
You spend the rest of your life
paying for it.

12:53.100 --> 12:54.900
And you die miserable and broke.

12:55.100 --> 12:57.500
So don't screw up.

12:58.100 --> 13:00.100
- Thank you.
- Now...

13:00.300 --> 13:03.600
- ...the fee for the course is $51.50.
- Don't worry.

13:03.800 --> 13:06.900
I'm an ex-cop. You stick with me,
I'll keep you out of trouble.

13:07.100 --> 13:10.700
Which you can pay now, or we can
deduct it from your first paycheck.

13:10.900 --> 13:14.100
In addition, as licensed
security guards...

13:14.300 --> 13:16.100
...you'll be required to join a union.

13:16.400 --> 13:20.100
The International Alliance
of Special Police and Guards.

13:20.600 --> 13:22.400
These are your union
representatives.

13:23.100 --> 13:24.400
Mr. Klepper...

13:24.600 --> 13:26.900
...and Mr. Lazarus.

13:33.800 --> 13:35.600
Thank you, Clarence.

13:35.700 --> 13:39.000
The initiation fee is $30,
payable now.

13:42.000 --> 13:43.800
Now, if you can't pay, don't worry.

13:44.000 --> 13:46.100
We'll deduct it
from your first paycheck.

13:46.300 --> 13:49.000
Thereafter, the weekly dues
will be $15...

13:49.200 --> 13:51.500
...and will be deducted automatically.

13:51.900 --> 13:53.900
The forms are in front of you
on the desk.

13:54.100 --> 13:55.800
Sign them and pass them forward.

13:56.200 --> 13:57.900
Any questions?

13:58.100 --> 14:01.700
Yes, I have a question.
Minor point.

14:01.900 --> 14:03.800
What if we don't wanna join?

14:06.800 --> 14:08.900
This is a union shop.

14:09.100 --> 14:10.500
You wanna work, you join.

14:11.400 --> 14:14.800
Well, I don't wanna speak
out of school, but $15 a week...

14:15.100 --> 14:16.700
...to me, seems excessive.

14:16.900 --> 14:18.400
Now, where does this money go?

14:20.900 --> 14:24.500
Well, that money goes
to your pension and welfare fund.

14:26.300 --> 14:27.800
And when are the benefits paid?

14:30.500 --> 14:32.500
When you're 65.

14:32.700 --> 14:36.100
- Sixty-five?
- Hey.

14:36.300 --> 14:38.700
What's with all the questions?

14:38.900 --> 14:40.700
This is your union.

14:40.900 --> 14:42.300
It's for your own protection.

14:43.300 --> 14:45.200
So shut up
and sign the fucking form.

14:47.800 --> 14:49.500
Do you have a pen?

14:56.000 --> 14:58.600
As you can see,
it's really quite simple.

14:59.600 --> 15:02.800
Just remember,
when you pull the trigger...

15:03.000 --> 15:06.700
...the bullets come out
going very, very fast.

15:06.900 --> 15:10.300
So make sure to keep the weapon
pointed away from you.

15:10.800 --> 15:12.400
Now, that's about it.

15:12.600 --> 15:16.000
You are now armed guards.

15:16.200 --> 15:17.600
God help us all.

15:18.000 --> 15:19.800
So return to your positions...

15:20.100 --> 15:22.100
...and load your guns, but do not...

15:23.100 --> 15:26.800
...I repeat, do not commence firing...

15:27.000 --> 15:30.900
...until I have left the target area.

15:31.100 --> 15:32.500
Thank you.

15:38.000 --> 15:40.100
You won't lie to me no more.

15:42.200 --> 15:44.400
Take that, you scumbag.

15:58.900 --> 16:01.000
Nice shooting, soldier.

16:01.800 --> 16:03.700
I can't tell you
how much I hate this.

16:03.900 --> 16:05.300
What's your problem?

16:05.500 --> 16:07.000
What's my problem?

16:07.300 --> 16:08.800
This is a dangerous weapon here.

16:09.000 --> 16:11.800
It can hurt somebody.
I can't shoot it.

16:12.000 --> 16:14.200
I-- I don't have it in me.

16:15.700 --> 16:19.000
See that turd in the red plaid shirt
who's gonna blow your head off?

16:19.200 --> 16:20.800
Watch.

16:27.700 --> 16:29.900
Do you wanna be partners?

16:30.400 --> 16:33.100
Raise your right hand,
repeat after me.

16:35.000 --> 16:37.300
- I...
- I...

16:37.500 --> 16:39.800
- ...state your name...
- ...state your name...

16:41.100 --> 16:43.200
...do solemnly swear
to uphold the laws...

16:43.400 --> 16:44.900
...of the state of California...

16:45.100 --> 16:47.000
...and government
of the United States...

16:47.200 --> 16:49.700
...in the exercise of my duties
as a special officer...

16:49.900 --> 16:52.400
- -in the exercise of my duties
as a special officer...

16:52.600 --> 16:55.100
...under the provisions
of the Private Guard Act...

16:55.300 --> 16:59.100
- -safety and security of the persons
or property placed in my charge.

16:59.400 --> 17:00.800
-placed in my charge.

17:01.100 --> 17:03.500
Okay, that's it.
Here are your diplomas.

17:03.800 --> 17:06.300
Fill them out
if your name's not on it.

17:06.500 --> 17:11.000
You're now fully licensed
security guards. Congratulations.

17:12.200 --> 17:15.700
Report to Sergeant Cavanaugh
for your assignments.

17:18.400 --> 17:20.900
- That's it?
- Yeah.

17:21.099 --> 17:23.200
Class of Thursday, 3:30 p.m.

17:23.400 --> 17:25.000
Congratulations.

17:25.200 --> 17:27.800
- Kane.
- Yes, right here.

17:28.000 --> 17:30.700
Carlex Pharmaceuticals.
Night shift, starting tomorrow.

17:30.900 --> 17:32.700
That's it? Just like that, huh?

17:32.900 --> 17:36.000
Mr. Kane, there are only two things
that you have to remember:

17:36.200 --> 17:38.400
Never fall asleep
where anyone can see you...

17:38.600 --> 17:42.000
...and make sure your name
is very clearly marked on your lunch.

17:42.300 --> 17:45.600
- Well, I can handle that.
- I'm gonna put you with Dooley here.

17:46.000 --> 17:48.200
- Hey, Dooley?
- Yeah?

17:48.400 --> 17:51.100
- You're working with Kane.
- Oh, good.

17:51.300 --> 17:53.100
- I'll keep an eye on him for you.
- No.

17:53.300 --> 17:56.100
I was hoping that he could
keep an eye on you.

17:56.300 --> 17:58.100
Kokolovitch.

17:58.300 --> 18:00.500
She likes me. Can you drive?

18:00.700 --> 18:02.000
- Yeah.
- Pick me up tomorrow.

18:02.200 --> 18:04.000
Hardtronics.

18:11.300 --> 18:13.200
Make a left.

18:20.300 --> 18:23.800
Guards Norman Kane
and Frank Dooley reporting--

18:28.700 --> 18:31.600
I love to watch a professional
at work, don't you?

18:35.100 --> 18:37.300
I think this job's gonna be
really good, Frank.

18:37.500 --> 18:39.900
- It's just what I need right now.
- Wanna slow down?

18:40.100 --> 18:42.200
What? Trying to suck up
first day on the job?

18:42.400 --> 18:45.400
- No, it's just--
- In such a big hurry to do nothing?

18:47.500 --> 18:50.300
- Look at those monsters.
- Jimmy, get the dog off my head!

18:50.500 --> 18:52.700
I can't!
Get in there!

18:53.300 --> 18:54.900
You wanna pet them?

18:55.500 --> 18:57.700
Come on, we'll go pet them.

19:02.800 --> 19:05.100
Norman Kane, Frank Dooley,
night shift.

19:07.200 --> 19:09.200
Here are your building layouts...

19:09.400 --> 19:11.000
...and your time clock locations.

19:11.200 --> 19:13.600
Take lunch at 11:30.

19:13.800 --> 19:16.700
And stay out the annex.
Pay attention, fat boy.

19:18.500 --> 19:21.000
It's canine control. You got it?

19:21.900 --> 19:24.800
Yeah, I-- I think so.

19:26.200 --> 19:27.700
Don't be a smart-ass, Dooley.

19:27.900 --> 19:29.500
Now go and relieve the day shift.

19:29.900 --> 19:31.300
Yes, sir.

19:31.700 --> 19:34.300
Yeah, come on,
let's go be security guards.

19:36.600 --> 19:38.700
What did you call him?
A muscle-bound jerk?

19:38.900 --> 19:40.300
- What?
- He's not.

19:40.500 --> 19:42.800
He's a nitwit,
but he's no muscle-bound jerk.

19:42.900 --> 19:44.300
Enough.

19:46.600 --> 19:49.700
Maybe he thought I was crazy
to keep trying.

19:50.000 --> 19:53.000
in your judgment, was your ship
on the verge of foundering...

19:53.200 --> 19:55.600
...when the executive officer
assumed command?

19:57.600 --> 19:59.600
- Dooley.
- Yeah?

20:00.000 --> 20:01.900
I told y'all to take lunch at 11:30.

20:02.100 --> 20:04.500
- So?
- So? It's 11:45.

20:04.700 --> 20:08.200
It's against the rules to be in a
working area during breaks or meals.

20:08.400 --> 20:09.700
Hey, man, read my lips.

20:09.900 --> 20:11.400
Report to the cafeteria.

20:11.900 --> 20:13.900
Can I just catch the end
of this movie?

20:14.100 --> 20:15.400
Now!

20:15.600 --> 20:18.800
Oh, what a bullshit rule.

20:19.300 --> 20:21.700
Come on,
let's go grab some lunch.

20:22.300 --> 20:25.100
I left my lunch in the car.
Meet you in the caf, all right?

20:25.400 --> 20:26.500
- Right.
- Save me a seat.

20:26.700 --> 20:28.600
Yeah, yeah.
Hey, how about a lift?

20:28.800 --> 20:31.100
Hey, you jerk.

20:47.600 --> 20:49.300
Hi, fellas. How's it going?

20:51.600 --> 20:54.500
Ski masks? Guys, I got news for you.

20:54.700 --> 20:56.200
It's not that cold tonight.

20:56.400 --> 20:58.600
Don't you have someplace
you're supposed to be?

20:58.800 --> 21:01.300
No, not right now.
I'm on lunch break. Half an hour.

21:01.500 --> 21:03.700
Saw you guys working,
thought I'd say hello.

21:03.900 --> 21:06.800
Do you fellas have an invoice
for this shipment?

21:07.300 --> 21:09.200
You're kidding, right?

21:09.800 --> 21:11.500
A bill of lading, perhaps?

21:13.100 --> 21:14.500
Look, Kane.

21:14.700 --> 21:16.900
We got special permission
to take this stuff.

21:17.100 --> 21:19.400
Well! So you say.

21:19.600 --> 21:22.700
But I gotta check it out
back at the office.

21:23.600 --> 21:25.200
You couldn't be that stupid.

21:28.200 --> 21:30.100
Oh, I don't know.

21:30.600 --> 21:32.000
I think I could be.

21:39.000 --> 21:41.200
- Yes?
- Absolutely.

21:41.400 --> 21:42.700
Wait a minute.

21:43.000 --> 21:44.600
I'm warning you.

21:46.400 --> 21:48.900
You guys are asking
for big trouble.

21:52.800 --> 21:54.800
Frank, come in.
I'm being chased.

21:55.000 --> 21:56.400
Two men in ski masks.

21:56.600 --> 21:58.400
Help. Help.

21:58.600 --> 22:00.200
Frank.

22:00.900 --> 22:03.900
Frank, I'm in the loading dock area.
Come in.

22:06.600 --> 22:09.300
You made me run.
I hate running.

22:09.600 --> 22:12.000
I'm gonna level with you.
Take whatever you want.

22:12.200 --> 22:14.000
I don't care.
I'm not a company man.

22:14.100 --> 22:15.500
Oh, you don't need those.

22:15.700 --> 22:19.800
You don't need those. You shoot me,
you're gonna have guilt.

22:20.500 --> 22:23.500
- You're dead meat, pal.
- Oh, God.

22:27.000 --> 22:28.400
Yeah.

22:29.600 --> 22:31.000
Freeze.

22:32.000 --> 22:33.600
Holy shit.

22:49.200 --> 22:51.900
Guard Dog Security.
Respond, please.

22:53.700 --> 22:55.300
Hello.

23:16.200 --> 23:17.800
Hi.

23:20.400 --> 23:22.400
You two are doing...

23:23.000 --> 23:24.500
...a great job.

23:25.300 --> 23:26.700
I'm gonna kill those guys.

23:26.900 --> 23:29.400
- Anthony, let's go.
- Get in the truck, we're leaving.

24:28.600 --> 24:30.500
Oh, you wanna play rough, do you?

24:30.700 --> 24:33.200
All right, let's play rough. Come on.

24:44.900 --> 24:47.500
Let that be a lesson to you,
you mutts.

24:53.800 --> 24:55.900
I don't suppose
you can identify any of them?

24:56.100 --> 24:59.500
Well, yeah, sure, I think it was
the U.S. Olympic downhill team.

24:59.700 --> 25:02.200
I told you,
they were wearing ski masks.

25:02.800 --> 25:05.200
How about you?
Can you describe any of them?

25:05.800 --> 25:08.500
Sort of, except...

25:08.700 --> 25:10.000
...for their heads.

25:10.900 --> 25:12.200
There were two guys.

25:12.700 --> 25:15.100
The big guy was...

25:16.900 --> 25:21.300
...big. And the smaller guy was--

25:21.600 --> 25:22.800
Smaller?

25:23.700 --> 25:25.600
You're a regular Dick Tracy.

25:25.900 --> 25:30.600
Well, I'm sorry, sir, I was scared. When
people are chasing you with guns...

25:30.900 --> 25:33.100
...you don't stop and ask
how much they weigh.

25:33.500 --> 25:35.500
Now, listen up and listen good.

25:35.700 --> 25:38.000
Last night was a major disaster.

25:38.100 --> 25:41.400
If you ever screw up like that again,
you're out. Do you hear me?

25:41.600 --> 25:44.000
Out! And just so you don't forget...

25:44.300 --> 25:46.700
...I'm fining each of you 100 bucks.

25:48.300 --> 25:49.900
Now get out of here.

25:50.100 --> 25:53.400
- Get out of here!
- Why, you...

25:57.700 --> 26:00.200
Dooley, Kane.

26:00.800 --> 26:03.000
What'd he say?
Are you in trouble?

26:03.200 --> 26:07.700
No, no, he let us off with a fine
and some very bad breath.

26:08.000 --> 26:11.900
We bust our asses for 4.60 an hour,
and he treats us like criminals!

26:12.100 --> 26:15.900
I'm gonna complain to the union,
that's what I'll do, because it's not fair.

26:16.100 --> 26:20.500
- That man is a jerk!
- And he's a subhuman, moronic...

26:20.800 --> 26:23.700
- ...poop-head.
- He's my father.

26:26.700 --> 26:29.000
Well, I'm sure he has
his good points.

26:29.200 --> 26:32.900
- Sure he does. He's salt of the earth.
- Qualities of a saint at times.

26:33.100 --> 26:36.000
- See you around.
- Okay.

26:40.500 --> 26:43.200
Thank you very much.
Now she hates me. Thank you.

26:43.400 --> 26:45.900
- You called him a poop-head.
- I don't wanna discuss it.

26:46.100 --> 26:48.000
Is that what you say
when you get angry?

26:48.200 --> 26:50.600
That the best you could
come up with? "Poop-head"?

26:53.600 --> 26:55.400
Gentlemen.

26:56.000 --> 26:58.400
- This is a mistake.
- Why?

26:58.600 --> 27:02.200
This is our union.
We have a legitimate grievance.

27:02.400 --> 27:04.900
Forget legitimate, all right?
Take a look up there.

27:05.200 --> 27:07.800
Brothers, with your kind permission.

27:08.000 --> 27:09.600
I bet 50 bucks any of those guys...

27:09.800 --> 27:12.200
...could tell you where
Jimmy Hoffa's body's buried.

27:14.200 --> 27:16.000
All right, gentlemen, can we begin?

27:19.100 --> 27:21.800
We'll dispense with the minutes
from the last meeting.

27:22.000 --> 27:25.300
We'll open the floor to new business.
Let's hear it, new business.

27:25.600 --> 27:29.000
Yes, Mr. Chairman,
my name is Norman Kane.

27:29.200 --> 27:32.000
I'd like to file a grievance
against Guard Dog Security.

27:32.900 --> 27:35.400
- What's your grievance?
- Don't do this.

27:35.900 --> 27:40.400
My partner and I were fined $100 each
for something that was not our fault.

27:42.400 --> 27:45.600
They were on the warehouse job
last night and screwed up.

27:48.400 --> 27:51.600
This is about the
Carlex Pharmaceutical robbery, right?

27:51.900 --> 27:52.900
Yes, it is.

27:53.100 --> 27:55.900
Why don't you just
pay the fine and sit down.

27:56.200 --> 27:58.900
- Any other new business?
- I'd like to file an appeal.

27:59.100 --> 28:00.600
You can't file an appeal.

28:00.800 --> 28:02.200
The board decision is final.

28:03.500 --> 28:05.500
Excuse me,
but I didn't see the board vote.

28:05.700 --> 28:07.800
They don't have to vote.

28:11.600 --> 28:13.000
Could you respond to this?

28:13.200 --> 28:17.100
There are approximately
5000 guards in this union...

28:17.400 --> 28:19.800
...each paying $15 a week in dues...

28:20.000 --> 28:22.900
...which amounts to roughly
$4 million a year.

28:23.100 --> 28:27.300
Now, I would like to know,
what happens to that money?

28:31.600 --> 28:34.900
That's a fiscal question,
and if we got a fiscal question...

28:35.100 --> 28:38.700
...then I gotta call our treasurer,
Lou Brackman. Lou, tell him.

28:41.900 --> 28:43.400
Just a minute.

28:44.500 --> 28:47.200
Under the leadership
of our president, Michael Carlino...

28:47.400 --> 28:50.700
...we have gone a long ways toward
answering the needs of its members.

28:50.900 --> 28:53.600
And I don't think it's proper
to take cheap shots at us...

28:53.900 --> 28:55.400
...without knowing all the facts.

28:55.700 --> 28:58.600
Point of parliamentary
procedure, Mr. Chairman.

29:05.900 --> 29:08.700
You listen to me, you facc'e merda.

29:08.900 --> 29:12.000
You show your face at another
union meeting, and so help me God...

29:12.200 --> 29:16.200
...I'm gonna break your legs.
This meeting is adjourned.

29:31.200 --> 29:32.500
What are you telling me, Frank?

29:32.900 --> 29:35.900
That they put us here because
I spoke up at the union meeting?

29:36.000 --> 29:38.700
If I were you, I wouldn't open
unusual pieces of mail...

29:38.900 --> 29:41.000
- ...in the next few weeks.
- You're paranoid.

29:41.200 --> 29:43.900
The truth is, this is just
an unpleasant job.

29:45.100 --> 29:47.200
Not that I'm complaining.

29:47.900 --> 29:52.100
But I'll tell you what I find
particularly difficult to believe.

29:52.300 --> 29:54.600
We're actually guarding garbage.

29:54.900 --> 29:58.700
Just keep your eyes open for that
international ring of garbage thieves.

30:01.700 --> 30:03.400
- Hey, isn't this great?
- Oh, yeah.

30:03.600 --> 30:05.200
Amazing what
some people throw away.

30:05.400 --> 30:07.400
This place is a gold mine,
I'm telling you.

30:07.600 --> 30:10.300
- Really?
- Oh, yeah, look at this here.

30:10.500 --> 30:13.500
I found this. Practically brand new,
hardly been used.

30:15.800 --> 30:17.700
- You guys find anything?
- Yeah.

30:17.900 --> 30:20.100
I found a toothbrush,
almost brand new.

30:20.400 --> 30:21.800
- What color?
- Red.

30:22.000 --> 30:26.400
- Perfect. Perfect match. Where?
- About three mounds over that way.

30:26.700 --> 30:27.900
- Over there?
- Yeah.

30:28.100 --> 30:29.800
Okay, great.
You guys need anything?

30:30.100 --> 30:31.300
- No.
- No.

30:31.600 --> 30:34.200
Okay. Keep an eye out
for a shoe like this, okay?

30:34.400 --> 30:36.800
Okay, take it easy. See you.

30:37.100 --> 30:38.600
See you later.

30:46.900 --> 30:49.300
- Yesterday, garbage, today, this.
- Quit complaining.

30:49.500 --> 30:52.400
- Let's just go to work.
- Yeah, no, just forget it, okay?

30:52.600 --> 30:55.900
I'll tell you, I've had it.
I can't take it anymore. I'm quitting.

30:56.100 --> 30:58.200
Don't be such a wussy.
Toughen up, will you?

30:58.500 --> 31:00.400
A little toxic waste
isn't gonna kill you.

31:00.600 --> 31:02.600
I'd like to father a child one day.

31:02.800 --> 31:05.000
I'd like that child
to look human, you know.

31:05.200 --> 31:06.600
Oh, mutations can't be that bad.

31:06.800 --> 31:09.300
Maybe he'll have a third arm.
Put him in a sideshow...

31:09.600 --> 31:13.100
- Glad you're taking this seriously.
- ...make a little extra-- All right.

31:13.500 --> 31:14.800
Hi, guys, how's it going?

31:15.000 --> 31:16.700
Lost two more teeth today.

31:18.400 --> 31:20.600
Jeez, you guys look terrible.

31:20.800 --> 31:25.400
- How long you been working here?
- Every day for the last three weeks.

31:26.700 --> 31:28.800
Why don't you put in
for another assignment?

31:29.000 --> 31:31.600
We did. They keep
sending us back here.

31:32.700 --> 31:35.600
- Why?
- I don't know.

31:35.800 --> 31:38.600
I mean, we used to be
on warehouse duty.

31:38.900 --> 31:41.900
That was great, wasn't it?
Warehouse duty?

31:42.300 --> 31:44.800
Then one night,
the place got robbed...

31:45.000 --> 31:48.200
...and O'Connell, he got
all mad at us for no reason.

31:48.400 --> 31:50.700
We-- We weren't even there.

31:50.900 --> 31:53.400
And Bruno, he told us
to take a break...

31:53.600 --> 31:57.100
...and the place got robbed
while we were gone.

31:57.400 --> 31:59.900
Bruno, the--? Big Bruno?

32:02.400 --> 32:03.600
It's not fair.

32:04.100 --> 32:06.100
- We're quitting.
- Oh, yeah.

32:06.300 --> 32:08.900
- Don't eat or drink anything here, guys.
- No, no.

32:09.200 --> 32:11.300
- Take lots of...
- Yeah.

32:11.600 --> 32:13.100
- ...showers.
- Thanks for the tip.

32:13.700 --> 32:15.800
You guys take care of yourselves.

32:19.600 --> 32:20.900
I'll tell you something.

32:21.100 --> 32:23.500
I'm not gonna end up
looking like that.

32:23.800 --> 32:25.100
Don't worry, you won't...

32:25.300 --> 32:28.800
...because we're gonna find out
what's going on around here, partner.

32:32.300 --> 32:34.500
I think what we're doing is wrong.

32:35.600 --> 32:37.600
I don't want anything to do with it.

32:38.000 --> 32:41.700
I mean, in principle I agree,
you understand?

32:41.900 --> 32:44.500
But just leave me out of it.

32:47.700 --> 32:49.500
There he is.

33:01.500 --> 33:03.400
Have a good workout, Bruno.

33:08.400 --> 33:10.500
May I see your
membership cards, please?

33:10.700 --> 33:13.000
- Show her our cards.
- Right.

33:13.200 --> 33:14.700
Don't have any cards.

33:16.800 --> 33:19.700
The reason we don't have cards
is we're thinking of joining...

33:20.000 --> 33:22.500
...and we'd like
to look around the place.

33:22.700 --> 33:25.100
I'll see if I can find someone
to take you on the tour.

33:25.400 --> 33:26.500
- How very kind.
- Thank you.

33:26.700 --> 33:28.200
Let's go.

33:29.100 --> 33:30.800
Hey, come back here.

33:33.200 --> 33:35.900
Come on, let's go.
Let's go! Move it.

34:19.900 --> 34:21.300
There you are.

34:22.600 --> 34:24.000
Come on.

34:26.300 --> 34:27.400
Are you strong.

34:29.699 --> 34:33.500
- How's it going, Bruno.
- What do you want, Dooley?

34:33.800 --> 34:36.699
Oh, I just wanna ask you
a few questions...

34:36.900 --> 34:39.400
...about the other night at Carlex.

34:45.199 --> 34:47.199
Hey, man, I don't know anything,
okay?

34:47.400 --> 34:51.000
Now, why don't you just get lost,
or I'm gonna hurt you bad.

34:51.199 --> 34:52.400
- We're gone.
- Real bad.

34:52.600 --> 34:54.300
Not that important.
Come on, Frank.

34:54.900 --> 34:55.900
That's it.

34:58.900 --> 35:02.200
Would you come on?
Let's go.

35:02.700 --> 35:05.900
Ten more, man. Come on. Ten more.
Come on, come on, come on.

35:08.500 --> 35:10.600
Absolutely not. No.

35:11.000 --> 35:12.800
Frank? No.

35:13.000 --> 35:15.700
Come on, two more. Come on,
two more. Come on, dig.

35:15.900 --> 35:18.400
- No, no.
- Yes, yes, yes.

35:21.700 --> 35:23.600
Come on, come on, two more.

35:24.300 --> 35:27.900
Come on. One more, one more.
Come on, be tough.

35:29.500 --> 35:32.000
Okay. I'm not messing around.

35:32.800 --> 35:34.800
Get in here. Now...

35:35.000 --> 35:38.100
- ...who told you to send us to lunch?
- What are you talking about?

35:38.300 --> 35:40.100
I can't hold it, Frank.

35:40.300 --> 35:43.400
- No upper-body strength.
- Hey, man, I don't know anything.

35:44.000 --> 35:46.700
- It's slipping.
- Goodbye, flathead.

35:49.100 --> 35:50.700
All right, all right! O'Connell...

35:50.900 --> 35:53.900
...he phoned me, man, told me
to send y'all to lunch. I swear!

35:55.900 --> 35:57.400
All right, let him go.

35:59.300 --> 36:02.100
I suggest we move.
Come on!

36:08.600 --> 36:10.300
Both of you, get out.

36:10.500 --> 36:13.000
There weren't enough
good-looking women for us here.

36:13.300 --> 36:16.500
- And there's no pool, so--
- Look, you heard what she said. Out.

36:17.000 --> 36:19.700
Hey, girls, stop those two guys!

36:20.100 --> 36:21.800
Get them, girls.

36:27.400 --> 36:28.500
Frank.

36:35.800 --> 36:38.000
Dooley! Dooley!

36:42.400 --> 36:45.200
Dooley, I'm gonna kill you!
I'm gonna kill you!

36:45.400 --> 36:47.000
I'm gonna--!

36:47.500 --> 36:51.200
I'm gonna kill you, man!
I'll kill you! I'll kill you!

36:51.400 --> 36:54.800
You wait, you wait!
You're dead!

37:12.900 --> 37:15.100
Freeze, or I'll feed you to the fish.

37:15.300 --> 37:17.300
- Oh, Frank Dooley.
- How's it going, Cappy?

37:17.500 --> 37:19.200
Okay. How you doing, big guy?

37:19.400 --> 37:21.200
Good to see you.
You're looking good.

37:21.400 --> 37:23.400
- You're looking good yourself.
- This is Norm.

37:23.700 --> 37:25.300
- Norm, Cappy.
- Hey, how you doing?

37:25.400 --> 37:26.900
- Cappy.
- How's the fishing?

37:27.100 --> 37:29.300
- No bites yet, Frank.
- Anybody using this?

37:29.500 --> 37:32.000
- No, go ahead, have some fun.
- You don't mind?

37:32.200 --> 37:35.300
- You wanna fish?
- No, I don't fish.

37:35.600 --> 37:37.100
Great.

37:37.300 --> 37:40.100
How you been doing?
I heard you got kicked off the force.

37:40.600 --> 37:42.400
Yeah, you heard right.

37:44.200 --> 37:46.400
You hear about a guy
named Michael Carlino?

37:46.900 --> 37:48.600
Now, that depends on who's asking.

37:49.400 --> 37:52.600
Oh, maybe a guy named
Andrew Jackson.

37:52.900 --> 37:55.200
Hey, come on, you know
I can't take money from you.

37:56.100 --> 37:58.100
I was hoping you'd say that.

37:58.600 --> 38:02.200
- But I'll take it from him.
- Great. Pay the man.

38:07.400 --> 38:08.900
There you go.

38:09.500 --> 38:11.700
Now, about Michael Carlino.

38:12.200 --> 38:15.800
Carlino is heavy. I mean, bigtime.

38:16.000 --> 38:19.400
It's organized guys like him that ran
us independents out of business.

38:19.800 --> 38:21.600
What business is that, Cappy?

38:22.100 --> 38:23.900
I only talk to Andrew Jackson.

38:32.000 --> 38:33.900
The question was,
what business is that?

38:34.300 --> 38:36.600
- Theft.
- You're a thief?

38:36.900 --> 38:39.400
- Retired.
- Not from where I'm standing.

38:39.600 --> 38:43.200
- Lighten up. He's trying to help us out.
- It's cost me a week's pay.

38:43.500 --> 38:46.300
Well, you're insulting him,
and you're embarrassing yourself.

38:48.100 --> 38:49.400
Hey!

38:49.700 --> 38:51.700
- Hey, I got something.
- What is it?

38:52.000 --> 38:55.000
A shark. I got a shark!
I got a shark!

38:56.200 --> 38:57.500
Out of the way! Shark!

38:57.700 --> 39:00.300
- He's got a shark!
- Shark!

39:00.600 --> 39:02.300
Get out of my way, will you?

39:03.700 --> 39:07.000
Will you get out of my way?
Come on, I got a shark here.

39:07.200 --> 39:09.500
You're crossing my lines.
Would you pull your--?

39:10.000 --> 39:11.600
Will you--? I got a shark!

39:11.800 --> 39:14.500
I've never had one--
Come on. My foot.

39:15.300 --> 39:17.300
Hey, get out of my face, will you?
Let me--

39:17.500 --> 39:19.300
I got a shark here!

39:19.600 --> 39:23.100
That's my line!
Will you let go of my line?

39:25.900 --> 39:30.100
All right, get back! Get back!
I got a gun!

39:35.500 --> 39:37.600
I got him. I got him.
Take a look at this.

39:37.800 --> 39:39.400
What is it?

39:40.000 --> 39:42.300
Now, that's fishing.

39:55.900 --> 39:58.100
It's nice of you to stop by,
but I'm in a hurry.

39:58.300 --> 40:01.300
I have to go to Michael Carlino's
party tonight, so...

40:01.600 --> 40:04.300
- What did you wanna talk to me about?
- Frank?

40:04.400 --> 40:06.100
- Go ahead.
- I'm not gonna ask her.

40:06.400 --> 40:08.400
- You ask.
- You said you wanted to talk.

40:08.700 --> 40:11.100
- Well, maybe I changed my mind.
- I don't care.

40:11.300 --> 40:14.300
- You wanted-- This is your idea.
- Why don't I go get ready...

40:14.500 --> 40:16.200
...while you guys
work this out, okay?

40:16.400 --> 40:18.300
Yeah, sure.

40:18.800 --> 40:22.100
Why don't you just ask her,
you little ferret. Go on.

40:22.400 --> 40:24.000
What, do I have to do everything?

40:31.100 --> 40:35.400
Maggie, what do you know
about Michael Carlino?

40:36.200 --> 40:39.800
Not much, really. I know he lent
my father some money...

40:40.000 --> 40:42.300
...about two years ago
to start Guard Dog.

40:42.500 --> 40:45.700
And he owns some
of the properties we protect.

40:46.100 --> 40:48.400
Why? Are you still worried
about this union thing?

40:48.700 --> 40:51.000
No. No, no.

40:53.800 --> 40:58.300
Have there been a lot of burglaries
over the last couple of years?

40:58.500 --> 41:02.200
Oh, I don't know. I've only been here
for the last six months.

41:03.900 --> 41:07.100
- I got divorced, and I needed a job.
- Get up. What are you doing?

41:07.300 --> 41:09.600
And my father asked me
to come work for him...

41:09.800 --> 41:11.400
...until I got back on my feet.

41:13.100 --> 41:14.500
Hello.

41:17.400 --> 41:19.500
Norman.

41:23.900 --> 41:25.900
Norman, what is this
all about, anyway?

41:26.100 --> 41:29.600
We have reason to believe that
your father and Michael Carlino...

41:29.800 --> 41:32.400
...are involved
in a major criminal conspiracy.

41:33.700 --> 41:35.100
- Oh, you do?
- Yes, we do.

41:35.300 --> 41:37.500
And I suppose
that you can prove that?

41:39.200 --> 41:41.500
No, not yet, but we're working on it.

41:41.700 --> 41:44.300
Well, work on it
someplace else, Dooley.

41:44.900 --> 41:48.600
My father is a good man.
Now, you both get out of my house.

41:48.800 --> 41:50.400
Come on, Frank.

41:53.400 --> 41:56.900
Maggie, we're not implying that your
father did anything wrong, okay?

41:57.200 --> 42:00.600
You know, you're a very nice man,
Norman, and I like you a lot.

42:01.000 --> 42:03.400
But you let your partner
talk you into something...

42:03.600 --> 42:05.700
...that doesn't make
a whole lot of sense.

42:06.600 --> 42:10.200
I would expect it from him,
but certainly not from you.

42:10.400 --> 42:13.400
And I'm very disappointed
in you, Norman.

42:14.100 --> 42:16.100
Now, please leave.

42:16.700 --> 42:18.600
I'm sorry.

42:18.800 --> 42:21.200
I was a good cop,
and I'm right about this.

42:21.800 --> 42:23.500
Get out.

42:23.700 --> 42:25.600
Get out.

42:43.000 --> 42:45.400
- You were great.
- All right.

42:47.200 --> 42:48.500
Fun, fun, fun.

42:50.400 --> 42:53.100
So Frank tells me you're an attorney.

42:53.900 --> 42:55.600
And what line of work
would you be in?

42:56.200 --> 42:58.400
I'm a technician in a tanning salon.

42:59.200 --> 43:00.500
It's kind of boring.

43:01.100 --> 43:04.200
- But I get all the free rays I want.
- Wonderful.

43:04.400 --> 43:06.800
See, no tan line.

43:07.900 --> 43:09.900
I don't see one, no.

43:10.900 --> 43:12.600
You got a tan line?

43:12.900 --> 43:16.000
- No tan line here.
- No tan line.

43:16.900 --> 43:19.500
Are these girls wonderful or what?

43:19.700 --> 43:21.800
Oh, wonderful.

43:23.400 --> 43:27.200
Oh, what's with Mr. Gloomy Gus?

43:27.400 --> 43:29.600
I just think you were
a little hard on Maggie.

43:29.800 --> 43:33.700
I mean, I like her. You know,
my partner, Mr. Silver Tongue...

43:33.900 --> 43:36.400
...tells her her father's
a crook to her face.

43:36.600 --> 43:39.000
Wonderful bedside manner.
Should've been a doctor.

43:39.600 --> 43:41.600
Why'd you do it, Frank?

43:41.700 --> 43:43.400
Because he is a crook.

43:43.600 --> 43:46.400
I chase crooks for a living.
That's what I do. I'm a cop.

43:48.300 --> 43:49.600
I used to be a cop.

43:49.900 --> 43:54.100
And you were a terrific cop, Frank.
The best.

43:54.300 --> 43:56.200
- Thanks, Vicki.
- Yeah.

43:56.600 --> 43:58.400
Can you get Peepee
to get a pitcher?

43:58.600 --> 44:00.500
That'd be Pepe, and I sure can.

44:01.000 --> 44:02.200
- Ned.
- What?

44:02.400 --> 44:04.300
Look who-- Come here.
Look who's here.

44:04.700 --> 44:08.600
Hey, Frank, what's happening?

44:08.800 --> 44:12.400
- Frank, how you doing?
- Word's on the street you got a job.

44:12.600 --> 44:14.000
- Yeah.
- Guard Dog Security?

44:14.300 --> 44:16.200
Yeah.

44:19.600 --> 44:21.300
Well, hello there.

44:21.600 --> 44:23.700
Hey, why don't you dance
with some real cops.

44:23.900 --> 44:25.600
These rent-a-cops are such a drag.

44:31.700 --> 44:34.600
Why don't we take these two
lovely ladies out for the evening.

44:34.900 --> 44:37.400
- Right.
- Roller-skating?

44:37.700 --> 44:39.500
No, I got a much better
idea than that.

44:39.700 --> 44:41.700
These guys will take care
of the bill here.

44:53.100 --> 44:57.200
I have a very serious question to
ask you. Are you enjoying yourself?

44:57.900 --> 45:01.400
- Well, do you wanna know the truth?
- No, I don't wanna know the truth.

45:01.600 --> 45:03.900
Then I'm having a wonderful time,
thank you.

45:04.100 --> 45:06.100
I'm having a wonderful time too.

45:06.300 --> 45:11.000
But we could have a better time
if we go upstairs and have a drink.

45:12.300 --> 45:13.500
- No.
- No?

45:13.700 --> 45:15.400
- Sorry. No, I'm working.
- What? Yeah?

45:15.600 --> 45:17.400
You're working.
You're working for me.

45:18.000 --> 45:19.700
No, no, I'm working for my father.

45:19.900 --> 45:23.100
You're working for your father?
Like I said, you're working for me.

45:23.300 --> 45:25.900
Who do you think owns Guard Dog?

45:30.600 --> 45:32.600
Excuse me, I do have work to do.

45:32.700 --> 45:34.400
What--?

45:46.700 --> 45:49.200
- Good evening, gentlemen.
- Hey.

45:49.500 --> 45:51.900
Frank, what are you guys
doing here?

45:52.100 --> 45:54.600
We're working undercover.

45:54.800 --> 45:57.500
Special assignment,
Operation Scumbag.

45:57.700 --> 45:59.800
It's classified. Very hush-hush.

46:00.000 --> 46:02.700
- Even O'Connell doesn't know.
- Oh, really?

46:03.000 --> 46:06.200
- Yeah.
- I don't see your name on the list here.

46:06.400 --> 46:07.800
Well, why would you?

46:08.100 --> 46:10.400
Do you think we'd go under
our real names?

46:12.900 --> 46:14.700
Well, what names are you under?

46:14.900 --> 46:17.400
Oh, let me see the list.

46:20.900 --> 46:23.800
Here we are here.
Pincus and McCarthy.

46:25.500 --> 46:28.800
Pincus and McCarthy.
Right, Mr. Pincus.

46:29.000 --> 46:30.500
- McCarthy.
- I'm Pincus.

46:30.600 --> 46:32.100
Get it together, Kokolovitch.

46:32.300 --> 46:35.900
You wanna open the doors, please?
I'd love to chat all evening with you.

46:36.200 --> 46:37.600
- Right.
- Have fun.

46:38.300 --> 46:40.200
I like your stole.

46:40.900 --> 46:44.200
These suits look ridiculous. We're
gonna stand out like sore thumbs.

46:44.400 --> 46:46.800
What do you expect on short notice?
I got us a deal.

46:47.000 --> 46:48.900
Yeah, what,
the Mexican-wedding rate?

46:49.100 --> 46:50.900
I think you guys both look hunky.

46:51.100 --> 46:53.400
Oh, thank you.

47:12.100 --> 47:15.300
I don't see O'Connell. Keep your
eyes open for Lazarus and Klepper.

47:15.500 --> 47:17.000
Gotcha.

47:17.400 --> 47:20.200
All right. Hey.

47:30.300 --> 47:32.600
- What are you doing?
- What's the matter?

47:32.800 --> 47:35.100
We look like a dance team.

47:35.300 --> 47:36.700
Well, what do you want me to do?

47:37.000 --> 47:39.100
Mingle.
You're a lawyer, aren't you?

47:39.400 --> 47:41.300
Investigate.

47:44.200 --> 47:46.400
- Let's mingle.
- Okay.

47:47.800 --> 47:50.400
- Champagne, please.
- Yes, sir.

47:52.600 --> 47:56.200
- Right away.
- I just love champagne.

47:56.500 --> 47:57.900
Good evening.

47:58.100 --> 48:00.500
- It's a wonderful affair, isn't it?
- Yes, it is.

48:00.700 --> 48:02.200
Yeah.

48:03.000 --> 48:05.700
Are you part of the entertainment?

48:08.800 --> 48:12.600
No, no, I've been jet-setting
around so much, you know...

48:12.900 --> 48:15.600
...I left my regular tuxedo
on the Concorde.

48:15.700 --> 48:17.700
It's probably in Paris by now.

48:18.100 --> 48:20.000
I had to get a rental.

48:22.200 --> 48:26.600
Gosh, I didn't realize
it was going to be this formal.

48:26.800 --> 48:29.400
If I had known it was going
to be this kind of party...

48:29.600 --> 48:31.600
...I would've worn underwear.

48:31.800 --> 48:35.000
You clumsy fool, look what you've
done all over my beautiful dress.

48:35.200 --> 48:36.700
- Dummy.
- Sorry.

48:36.900 --> 48:38.800
- Get your hands off me.
- Sorry.

48:39.000 --> 48:40.400
- Come on.
- Sorry.

48:41.900 --> 48:43.300
- You hungry?
- Yeah.

48:43.600 --> 48:46.400
Give me it. She's hungry.

48:48.600 --> 48:51.300
- You wanted to see me, Mike?
- Yeah, I did. Wait a second.

48:51.400 --> 48:52.700
Hey...

48:52.900 --> 48:57.100
Hey, I'll catch up with you later,
okay? You're beautiful.

48:59.600 --> 49:01.000
I just saw O'Connell.

49:01.300 --> 49:04.000
He's over there talking to Carlino.

49:07.600 --> 49:09.300
I wonder what they're saying.

49:09.500 --> 49:11.100
I used to be able to read lips.

49:11.500 --> 49:13.800
"Hello, Mike.
I hear you lost your penis."

49:14.200 --> 49:15.900
"Oh, yes. Yes, I did.

49:16.500 --> 49:17.700
Have you seen it?"

49:17.900 --> 49:20.400
"Yes, I believe I saw it
with the cocktail wieners."

49:20.600 --> 49:24.600
"Oh, thank you very much.
I better look in the kitchen then."

49:25.100 --> 49:27.300
- Or words to that effect.
- I'm glad I asked.

49:28.800 --> 49:31.000
- Hi, Daddy.
- Hey, sweetheart.

49:31.200 --> 49:33.000
- Everything under control?
- Yeah.

49:33.200 --> 49:35.700
I must have a complete set
of Carlino's fingerprints...

49:36.000 --> 49:37.700
...on my fanny by now.

49:38.400 --> 49:39.800
- That son of a bi--
- Hey.

49:40.000 --> 49:42.600
I'm a big girl now.
I can take care of myself.

49:42.800 --> 49:45.300
Yeah? Yeah?

49:45.800 --> 49:48.600
- Can I ask you a question?
- Sure. What? Anything.

49:48.900 --> 49:52.900
What do you think
of Dooley and Kane?

49:53.800 --> 49:56.100
- Why do you ask?
- Because they said...

49:56.300 --> 50:00.400
...that Carlino was responsible
for the warehouse robberies...

50:00.600 --> 50:03.100
...and that you were helping him.

50:03.500 --> 50:06.300
- And you believed them?
- No, I don't believe them, Daddy.

50:06.500 --> 50:08.400
That's why I'm asking you.

50:08.900 --> 50:10.400
Look...

50:11.200 --> 50:14.500
...I don't have to explain myself
to you or anybody else.

50:20.200 --> 50:22.500
- Michael.
- Hey, Lou.

50:22.900 --> 50:25.000
- I'm glad you could make it, baby.
- All right.

50:25.400 --> 50:27.900
I gotta talk to you in private...

50:28.100 --> 50:31.700
...but, Tony, Floyd, take
Mr. Brackman down to the pool.

50:31.900 --> 50:34.700
Just give us about 10 minutes, right?

50:35.600 --> 50:37.400
Sure, Michael.

50:38.600 --> 50:42.300
- Glass of bubbly, Lou?
- Why not?

50:42.600 --> 50:46.300
Don't eat too much. We're going out
for pizza later. Wait here. Come on.

50:46.500 --> 50:48.800
- What are we doing?
- Come on.

50:52.700 --> 50:53.900
We're early.

50:54.100 --> 50:55.400
Come on.

50:58.500 --> 51:00.000
It's locked.

51:01.600 --> 51:04.000
- Somebody's coming.
- Oh, jeez.

51:06.300 --> 51:08.500
Come on, hurry.

51:27.400 --> 51:29.100
Hey, turn on the steam, Tony.

51:29.300 --> 51:31.600
I gotta relax before
I go up to that party.

51:31.800 --> 51:34.000
Because I really like it hot.

51:34.200 --> 51:35.600
You did everything I told you?

51:35.800 --> 51:39.100
Yes, I took the pension and welfare
fund, I converted it to cash...

51:39.300 --> 51:42.700
...and negotiable bonds just like
you said, but I don't like it, Michael.

51:42.900 --> 51:45.300
Why do you need so much cash,
over $11 million?

51:45.900 --> 51:49.100
Because we're gonna make a major
transaction down in South America.

51:49.400 --> 51:51.900
And our friends down there
don't take credit cards.

51:52.200 --> 51:55.400
If that's union money, how can you
use it to pay the Colombians?

51:55.700 --> 51:59.000
You're gonna take that money, you're
gonna put it in an armored car...

51:59.200 --> 52:01.200
...and transfer it to a bank
in Riverside.

52:01.400 --> 52:04.900
But guess what? I'm gonna make sure
the armored car doesn't get there.

52:05.500 --> 52:07.500
But don't be a schmuck.
You can't do that.

52:07.700 --> 52:10.700
- Insurance will take care of it.
- The insurance company's...

52:10.900 --> 52:13.800
...gonna ask questions, like
why I turned everything into cash.

52:14.000 --> 52:17.000
There's bound to be an investigation,
and I'll take the fall.

52:17.300 --> 52:20.500
You can't do this, Michael.
Don't be an asshole.

52:27.200 --> 52:29.700
Yeah, jeez, you're right, Lou.

52:30.100 --> 52:33.300
What a testa dura I am. Oh, jeez.

52:34.900 --> 52:37.200
Frank. Frank.

52:37.400 --> 52:40.800
- I gotta get out!
- Would you shut up?

52:41.000 --> 52:45.400
Lou, thank you. Thank you, baby,
for telling me about it. Thank you.

52:45.700 --> 52:48.300
You know, I'm trying to do
what's best for everybody.

52:48.900 --> 52:51.300
Yeah, sure. Thanks, Lou. Thank you.

52:51.500 --> 52:53.500
- I guess I'll be going now.
- Now, Lou...

52:53.700 --> 52:57.400
...why don't you have Tony
and Floyd see you home.

52:57.800 --> 52:59.200
Goodbye, Lou.

52:59.600 --> 53:02.800
- Frank!
- Go on, get out of here!

53:03.500 --> 53:05.600
So-- So long. Michael--

53:17.000 --> 53:19.300
Excuse me...

53:19.500 --> 53:22.200
...have you seen
our dates anywhere?

53:22.400 --> 53:25.100
Your dates? What are their names?

53:26.700 --> 53:30.000
Oh, we don't have any dates tonight.

53:30.200 --> 53:32.300
- No, we're alone.
- No, no, you're not alone.

53:32.500 --> 53:35.100
You're with Michael Carlino.
I'm your date.

53:35.300 --> 53:38.400
Let's take our clothes off.
We'll go inside, take a steam bath.

53:38.600 --> 53:40.800
- We'll get acquainted.
- We're really hungry.

53:41.000 --> 53:43.600
- Could you take us to dinner?
- We're gonna go one-on-one.

53:43.900 --> 53:45.700
I mean, we're gonna have
a threesome.

53:46.100 --> 53:48.600
- The girls are out there.
- Frank.

53:48.900 --> 53:50.100
Frank.

53:50.600 --> 53:53.600
All right, we'll eat first, and then
we are gonna steam, right?

53:53.800 --> 53:55.800
- Yeah.
- That's a promise. Let's do it.

53:56.000 --> 53:58.600
- Come on.
- Hold on.

54:00.500 --> 54:02.400
Okay.

54:11.500 --> 54:13.400
I'll kill you, you son of a--!

54:13.600 --> 54:15.800
All right, all right.

54:16.000 --> 54:18.400
"Let's go in the steam room."

54:18.600 --> 54:21.300
Good idea, Frank. Real good.

54:21.500 --> 54:23.700
Good thing we didn't hide
in the barbecue pit.

54:23.900 --> 54:26.500
Carlino would've had
a sudden craving for ribs.

54:26.700 --> 54:30.600
I don't listen to you anymore. From
now on, I call the shots. Got that?

54:30.800 --> 54:32.000
- I call the shots.
- Come on.

54:32.300 --> 54:34.000
They're gonna nail Brackman.

54:35.400 --> 54:38.700
Come on, you guys.
Mike was only kidding, right?

54:40.500 --> 54:42.100
Give me a break.

54:42.400 --> 54:45.800
You couldn't give me a pass on this
one, Tony? I could just disappear.

54:46.000 --> 54:49.100
Oh, you're gonna disappear,
all right. Get in the car, Lou.

54:49.300 --> 54:50.800
Brackman!

54:51.800 --> 54:54.700
Brackman, run for it!

54:57.100 --> 54:59.000
Smoke him, Anthony.

55:02.300 --> 55:04.200
Brackman, come here. You made it.

55:07.100 --> 55:09.100
Frank, he's not moving.

55:11.700 --> 55:13.700
It's too late. He's dead.

55:17.300 --> 55:20.100
- What's going on out here?
- I don't know, people shooting.

55:20.300 --> 55:22.600
- There's a body.
- Who the hell are those guys?

55:24.600 --> 55:26.900
Help! Hit men!

55:27.400 --> 55:30.600
Hit men! Help!

55:30.900 --> 55:32.500
Couple of hit men out here.

55:32.700 --> 55:35.000
Dooley, Kane,
what the hell are you doing?

55:35.200 --> 55:37.500
- You know those guys?
- Yeah, they work for me.

55:37.700 --> 55:40.700
They just knocked off Lou Brackman.
Get the cops.

55:41.500 --> 55:43.500
Well, Mr. Brains,
what do we do now?

55:45.300 --> 55:47.800
- Get the car!
- Get the car.

55:49.700 --> 55:52.500
- Don't let them get away. Stop them.
- Hey, stop.

55:52.700 --> 55:54.500
See, they're not stopping.

55:58.900 --> 56:00.300
Go.

56:04.100 --> 56:05.700
Go, go.

56:12.600 --> 56:14.900
- Okay, everybody, it's all over.
- It's all over.

56:15.100 --> 56:17.100
You can come out now.
Kokolovitch!

56:17.300 --> 56:19.900
Make sure everybody goes
to their cars peacefully.

56:20.100 --> 56:21.900
Don't panic, don't panic.

56:22.100 --> 56:23.500
Do you believe it?

56:23.700 --> 56:27.600
In my house, they kill
my best friend, Lou Brackman.

56:27.800 --> 56:30.800
Dad, you know they didn't kill him.

56:31.000 --> 56:33.300
I told you to stay out of this,
didn't I?

56:38.200 --> 56:40.800
Union racketeering,
grand theft, now murder.

56:41.100 --> 56:42.500
We're gonna get those guys.

56:42.700 --> 56:44.700
Get them?
I wanna get away from them.

56:55.500 --> 56:57.800
- Oh, thank God, the police.
- Don't stop.

56:58.000 --> 56:59.600
- Why?
- Don't stop!

57:06.300 --> 57:09.300
What are you doing?
You're going down a one-way street.

57:15.100 --> 57:18.000
- Watch where you're going.
- I'm watching. Did you get them?

57:18.200 --> 57:19.300
No.

57:22.000 --> 57:23.800
Look at those guys.

57:53.100 --> 57:55.400
- Come on, let's go.
- All right. All right.

57:58.900 --> 58:00.500
Frank, come on.

58:08.900 --> 58:10.100
Come on.

58:31.500 --> 58:33.700
- My friend got married today.
- Got married.

58:33.900 --> 58:36.700
- He's going on his honeymoon tonight.
- Big night tonight.

58:40.200 --> 58:41.700
We're gonna keep browsing.

58:41.900 --> 58:43.800
- Yeah.
- Right.

58:56.500 --> 58:59.200
- What are you reading?
- Panty Boys. And you?

58:59.500 --> 59:01.700
Love Suckers.

59:09.100 --> 59:10.800
I want you to case these buildings.

59:11.000 --> 59:13.200
And question some of these people.

59:14.500 --> 59:17.000
Let's check this place out.
Hey, get out of the way.

59:20.300 --> 59:21.800
Jesus.

59:22.300 --> 59:24.100
Hey, I already paid you
for this month.

59:24.300 --> 59:26.100
Zip it. We're looking for somebody.

59:34.100 --> 59:37.200
Well, what do we do now, Frank?
We can't stay in here all night.

59:37.400 --> 59:38.900
I know.

59:43.500 --> 59:45.300
Give me a quarter.

59:46.700 --> 59:48.800
- Oh, for God's sake.
- Just give me a quarter.

59:49.000 --> 59:52.300
- Learn to control your urges.
- If it offends you, don't watch.

59:52.600 --> 59:53.800
- You're sick.
- Thank you.

59:54.000 --> 59:56.300
- You're a sick man.
- Just check the door.

59:58.200 --> 59:59.700
Sick.

01:00:15.500 --> 01:00:17.700
The cops are still out there.

01:00:21.800 --> 01:00:25.400
- Do we really have time for this, Frank?
- It helps me think.

01:00:35.500 --> 01:00:37.300
- It's all right, I got it.
- I got it.

01:00:37.500 --> 01:00:40.000
- I got it, I got it.
- All right, all right, all right.

01:00:40.300 --> 01:00:43.900
Here, grab a chair, grab a chair.
Hurry up. Get out of the way.

01:00:49.100 --> 01:00:50.800
Hello.

01:00:52.100 --> 01:00:54.700
I think she likes me. Yeah.

01:00:54.900 --> 01:00:57.400
- Frank, I've got an idea.
- Yeah, me too.

01:00:58.900 --> 01:01:00.600
Wait, wait, give me a quarter.

01:01:00.800 --> 01:01:04.000
- Give me a quarter! Dig, dig!
- All right, here. Easy. See a doctor.

01:01:21.100 --> 01:01:23.000
Fifi.

01:01:38.600 --> 01:01:41.500
Disgusting magazines.
I'm out of here.

01:01:53.100 --> 01:01:56.400
- If you tell anyone about this--
- I'll send a postcard to my family.

01:01:56.600 --> 01:01:59.000
- I'm just warning you, that's all.
- Let's go.

01:02:05.900 --> 01:02:09.700
The guy is kind of a big blond guy.
He's kind of funny-looking.

01:02:09.900 --> 01:02:13.600
The other one's dark,
curly hair, sort of ethnic.

01:02:13.800 --> 01:02:15.900
Maybe you've seen
these guys around.

01:02:20.300 --> 01:02:22.200
What are you looking at,
you schmuck?

01:02:22.900 --> 01:02:25.800
Oh, isn't he cute?
And look at these muscles.

01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:28.500
Get your hands off me.
I'm a police officer.

01:02:28.700 --> 01:02:30.900
- He gets frisky when he sees a badge.
- Hey.

01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:33.500
- Hello.
- What are you doing later on tonight?

01:02:33.800 --> 01:02:35.500
Take a walk, you jerk.

01:02:35.700 --> 01:02:38.200
- Let's trot.
- Why can't you look this good?

01:02:38.500 --> 01:02:40.300
Mother Nature
wasn't kind to some of us.

01:02:40.500 --> 01:02:41.900
- Move it.
- Oh, he touched me.

01:02:42.100 --> 01:02:44.500
I got my Christmas goose early.

01:02:47.300 --> 01:02:50.100
- Oh, aren't you the cheeky one.
- That's like the pot...

01:02:50.300 --> 01:02:53.000
- ...calling the kettle black.
- Oh, is that a fact?

01:03:06.100 --> 01:03:08.200
Hi, Maggie. Thanks for coming.

01:03:09.800 --> 01:03:11.200
I'm sorry.

01:03:11.500 --> 01:03:15.000
I came as soon as you called me.
I'm sorry.

01:03:15.200 --> 01:03:17.700
You guys aren't hurt
or anything, are you?

01:03:17.900 --> 01:03:20.900
No, not hurt, not hurt.
I'm a little upset.

01:03:21.100 --> 01:03:23.300
I'm a little angry.
I'm tired of being shot at.

01:03:23.500 --> 01:03:26.900
I'm tired of being treated
like a sexual object.

01:03:27.100 --> 01:03:30.900
- I wish you listened to us yesterday.
- I'm sorry. I'm ready to listen now.

01:03:31.100 --> 01:03:33.600
Okay? So, what's going on?

01:03:35.700 --> 01:03:37.500
Carlino is hitting an armored truck.

01:03:37.700 --> 01:03:41.400
It carries the union's pension and
welfare money. Frank's got a plan.

01:03:41.900 --> 01:03:43.300
- Give me the map.
- No.

01:03:43.500 --> 01:03:45.600
- Give me the map.
- No.

01:03:45.800 --> 01:03:47.500
Bend over.

01:03:49.700 --> 01:03:54.200
Now, they're planning on hitting this
truck between here and Riverside.

01:03:54.400 --> 01:03:57.500
But we're gonna nail them first,
right here at Seventh and Elm.

01:03:57.700 --> 01:04:01.400
This is where you come in. You gotta
arrange that Norm is driving that truck.

01:04:01.900 --> 01:04:04.400
He can lead Carlino's men
to our rendezvous point...

01:04:04.600 --> 01:04:08.200
- ...where I'll catch them in the act.
- I'm driving the truck?

01:04:09.200 --> 01:04:12.000
- Yeah, did I forget to mention that?
- Yes, you did forget.

01:04:12.200 --> 01:04:16.400
I'm driving the truck? Sorry, it sounds
a little flaky now, you know?

01:04:16.600 --> 01:04:18.300
This whole plan sounds dangerous.

01:04:18.500 --> 01:04:21.700
I mean, what if you're not there,
Frank? Do you have a backup plan?

01:04:21.900 --> 01:04:25.000
There's no backup plan, buddy boy.
This is it. I'll be there.

01:04:26.700 --> 01:04:31.800
You see, the point is this: There's
good guys, and there's bad guys.

01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:35.600
There's right, and there's wrong.

01:04:36.100 --> 01:04:38.500
And there comes a time
in every man's life...

01:04:38.700 --> 01:04:41.300
...when he's gotta take a stand.

01:04:41.500 --> 01:04:43.200
And this time is now.

01:04:45.500 --> 01:04:48.400
You're right. You're right.

01:04:48.600 --> 01:04:51.400
- Well, count me in.
- Thanks, Maggie.

01:04:57.400 --> 01:05:00.100
- What about you? You all set?
- All set.

01:05:00.300 --> 01:05:02.700
- Everything's in place.
- Okay, good.

01:05:03.500 --> 01:05:06.300
But you gotta keep me informed.
I gotta know when it's over.

01:05:06.500 --> 01:05:07.900
Okay.

01:05:10.400 --> 01:05:13.700
What's the matter with you, Clarence?
You got a problem?

01:05:14.700 --> 01:05:16.700
I just don't want
any of our drivers hurt.

01:05:19.600 --> 01:05:22.100
- You don't want any of our drivers--?
- Right.

01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:25.000
What the hell is this?

01:05:25.300 --> 01:05:27.400
A Holy Name Society
meeting or something?

01:05:27.600 --> 01:05:30.900
Don't you get emotional
on me now, Clarence, eh?

01:05:31.200 --> 01:05:34.300
You listen to me.
I warned you before.

01:05:34.500 --> 01:05:37.100
Just do what I tell you,
because people might get hurt.

01:05:37.800 --> 01:05:40.500
Including that daughter
of yours, right?

01:05:41.300 --> 01:05:42.700
You understand what I mean?

01:05:43.700 --> 01:05:46.900
- Yeah, I understand.
- You better.

01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:49.300
You better understand what I mean.

01:05:50.100 --> 01:05:51.500
Get his ass out of here.

01:05:55.400 --> 01:05:57.000
Gentlemen, there's been a change.

01:05:57.200 --> 01:05:59.300
I'm taking you off
the armored car run.

01:05:59.600 --> 01:06:02.500
But Captain O'Connell told us
not to screw up.

01:06:02.700 --> 01:06:05.500
Yes, that's why I'm taking you off.

01:06:08.500 --> 01:06:10.300
Better safe than sorry.

01:06:10.500 --> 01:06:12.200
Yes, you're right.

01:06:40.300 --> 01:06:42.100
Oh, that figures.

01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:54.500
Hey, you driving this thing?

01:06:56.300 --> 01:06:59.800
- That's right.
- I'd hate to be in your shoes, pal.

01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:01.600
Biggest shipment we've ever had.

01:07:01.800 --> 01:07:04.500
Might as well paint "hit me"
on the side of this truck.

01:07:08.300 --> 01:07:09.700
Well, nice talking to you.

01:07:10.800 --> 01:07:12.300
Yeah.

01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:19.200
- What are you doing here?
- I'm riding shotgun.

01:07:19.400 --> 01:07:20.600
- Oh, no.
- Oh, yes.

01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:22.700
- I can't let you do this, Maggie.
- Why?

01:07:22.900 --> 01:07:25.700
Somehow I'd feel bad if we both
got killed on our first date.

01:07:26.300 --> 01:07:27.600
Don't worry, Norm.

01:07:28.900 --> 01:07:30.500
All right, you're loaded.
Let it roll.

01:07:31.200 --> 01:07:34.100
Let's go. Let's go.

01:07:54.700 --> 01:07:56.400
Okay.

01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:08.600
Come on, now.

01:08:08.800 --> 01:08:10.700
There we go.

01:08:10.900 --> 01:08:12.900
Come on.

01:08:13.500 --> 01:08:14.800
Don't do this to me.

01:08:15.600 --> 01:08:19.200
Hey, what are you doing here?
I put you on that armored truck job.

01:08:19.600 --> 01:08:21.500
But Sergeant Cavanaugh
took us off.

01:08:21.700 --> 01:08:23.300
So who's driving the truck?

01:08:23.500 --> 01:08:25.100
She is.

01:08:25.899 --> 01:08:28.800
- Better safe than sorry.
- Right.

01:08:31.500 --> 01:08:33.500
Okay, Dolan, you ready?

01:08:33.700 --> 01:08:36.899
We're headed toward Spring Street.
We'll be there in 18 minutes.

01:08:37.200 --> 01:08:39.500
We're ready.
Give us a couple minutes warning.

01:08:39.700 --> 01:08:43.100
Dolan, we're going
for a kind of terrorist look...

01:08:43.300 --> 01:08:46.000
...so smoke the drivers.
No witnesses on this one.

01:08:49.399 --> 01:08:52.100
Come on. There we go,
right onto the road.

01:08:52.200 --> 01:08:53.600
Now you know where you are.

01:08:57.500 --> 01:08:59.600
Ice cream, you ready?

01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:06.000
Well, there they are.

01:09:09.600 --> 01:09:11.600
So far, so good.

01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:18.000
We're all set. There'll be no police
coverage in the area for 20 minutes.

01:09:18.500 --> 01:09:21.899
Rizzo, it's about time
you earned your money.

01:09:22.100 --> 01:09:24.000
You make sure it stays empty.

01:09:24.500 --> 01:09:27.600
Yeah, right. Jerk.

01:09:28.399 --> 01:09:30.600
All right, that's it. One more time.

01:09:30.899 --> 01:09:33.600
This is it.
It's the last chance you'll get.

01:09:33.700 --> 01:09:36.500
All right. Here we go.

01:09:41.899 --> 01:09:43.600
All right!

01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:47.000
Come on, we got work to do.

01:09:47.899 --> 01:09:50.500
Let's kick some ass.

01:09:53.700 --> 01:09:57.100
Okay, now, this is where
they expect us to go, right?

01:09:57.400 --> 01:09:58.300
Right.

01:09:58.500 --> 01:10:00.500
- That's where we're really gonna go.
- Right.

01:10:00.700 --> 01:10:02.600
- Frank won't be there.
- He'll be there.

01:10:02.800 --> 01:10:04.800
He won't be there.
He'll wanna be there.

01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:08.700
It won't be his fault,
but he won't be there.

01:10:11.300 --> 01:10:14.000
Hang on, here we go.

01:10:19.800 --> 01:10:21.200
- Good work, Norman.
- Yeah.

01:10:21.400 --> 01:10:23.800
That crazy bastard.
Hang on, Floyd!

01:10:33.900 --> 01:10:35.900
What's going on?

01:10:51.200 --> 01:10:55.100
Oh, great. Just my luck.

01:11:05.600 --> 01:11:08.300
Hey! Idiot!

01:11:12.700 --> 01:11:14.000
No!

01:11:14.500 --> 01:11:16.500
No!

01:11:17.100 --> 01:11:20.900
That's it, I've had it with you.
I've had it up to here.

01:11:28.400 --> 01:11:31.900
Okay, six more blocks
and a right turn.

01:11:32.100 --> 01:11:33.500
Looks like we got company.

01:11:43.800 --> 01:11:45.200
Waste them, Floyd!

01:11:48.800 --> 01:11:51.800
All right, no more Mr. Nice Guy.

01:11:57.700 --> 01:11:59.700
They're trying to kill us, Anthony!

01:12:04.800 --> 01:12:07.100
Watch out, Anthony!

01:12:24.800 --> 01:12:26.200
See you, suckers.

01:12:38.700 --> 01:12:40.500
I really hate those guys.

01:12:41.700 --> 01:12:45.300
- I think I'm getting the hang of this.
- Very impressive, Norman.

01:12:45.500 --> 01:12:47.300
Norm.

01:12:47.500 --> 01:12:51.100
Dolan, they're on Industrial,
heading your way. Cut them off.

01:12:51.700 --> 01:12:53.100
Let's go.

01:13:02.300 --> 01:13:07.200
Ma, this was a mistake.
Oh, yeah, this ain't gonna last.

01:13:09.100 --> 01:13:11.200
- Lady, open up! Open up!
- What? What?

01:13:11.500 --> 01:13:12.600
I'm a special officer.

01:13:12.800 --> 01:13:14.500
- Give me your car.
- What are you, nuts?

01:13:14.800 --> 01:13:17.300
- Get out of my face. Get, get.
- No, no--

01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:24.100
Give me your car.

01:13:25.400 --> 01:13:28.300
Hey. Hey, hey, I need your help.

01:13:30.100 --> 01:13:32.400
No way.

01:13:37.200 --> 01:13:39.700
- Throw me another one.
- What a geek.

01:13:46.900 --> 01:13:48.400
Your mom dress you?

01:13:49.200 --> 01:13:50.500
Hey!

01:14:25.800 --> 01:14:29.600
Wait, this is an armored car!
Get up, Norman!

01:14:29.800 --> 01:14:31.400
- Oh, Mother!
- No!

01:14:40.500 --> 01:14:44.800
Shit. Come on, get this thing
out of here. Get it out of here.

01:14:45.100 --> 01:14:48.100
Well, don't just sit there,
tell me where we are.

01:14:55.600 --> 01:14:57.700
- What the hell is going on?
- What's going on?

01:14:57.900 --> 01:15:00.900
- Your boys lost the truck.
- You kidding me? Where are they now?

01:15:01.100 --> 01:15:03.200
I don't know.

01:15:03.400 --> 01:15:04.600
Let's go!

01:15:14.900 --> 01:15:16.400
- Don't let them get away!
- Okay.

01:15:16.600 --> 01:15:18.600
There's $11 million in there.
Come on.

01:15:18.700 --> 01:15:20.100
- Got it! Got it!
- Get them!

01:15:23.600 --> 01:15:25.900
Watch this!

01:15:27.200 --> 01:15:29.600
Watch it!

01:15:37.900 --> 01:15:39.200
Surprise.

01:15:39.400 --> 01:15:41.800
Are you pazzo?
What are you doing, Clarence?

01:15:42.200 --> 01:15:44.700
Something I should have done
a long time ago, Carlino:

01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:47.700
- Bust your ass!
- What?

01:15:48.200 --> 01:15:53.200
Hey, there's my father.
He's helping us.

01:15:59.600 --> 01:16:04.700
I only got time to say this once.
I'm a special officer.

01:16:04.900 --> 01:16:07.100
And you gotta get me to 83rd
and Aviation.

01:16:07.300 --> 01:16:09.800
Otherwise, two very wonderful
people are gonna die.

01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:11.600
Well, climb on in here, slim.

01:16:13.500 --> 01:16:15.900
Thank you very much.

01:16:18.300 --> 01:16:21.200
Well, let's see how fast this
son of a bitch can go!

01:16:28.700 --> 01:16:32.500
Hold on tight
to your saddle horns, son!

01:16:43.900 --> 01:16:46.400
We're moving now!

01:16:48.200 --> 01:16:51.300
Get out of here!

01:17:15.400 --> 01:17:16.800
Sorry about that!

01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:26.100
Just like those bumper cars,
remember?

01:17:26.300 --> 01:17:31.400
- Hey, you're all right, you know that?
- Yeah, you too, buddy. I like you.

01:17:36.300 --> 01:17:38.800
Move it!

01:17:46.300 --> 01:17:50.300
- Turn off over here.
- All right.

01:18:10.400 --> 01:18:12.900
Slim, I ain't never seen a handgun
that big before.

01:18:13.400 --> 01:18:14.800
Yeah, it's a .50 caliber.

01:18:15.000 --> 01:18:19.200
They used to use it to hunt
buffalo with. Up close.

01:18:19.400 --> 01:18:21.900
It's only legal in two states.

01:18:22.200 --> 01:18:24.900
- And this isn't one of them.
- You're something else, slim.

01:18:35.200 --> 01:18:38.400
Dolan, they're on Industrial,
heading your way. You cut them off.

01:18:38.600 --> 01:18:40.200
We're on our way!

01:18:40.500 --> 01:18:42.300
They're coming right for you.

01:18:42.500 --> 01:18:44.300
- Are you ready?
- We're ready.

01:18:45.000 --> 01:18:48.400
- So, what are you hauling?
- Rocket fuel.

01:18:48.800 --> 01:18:51.000
Oh, perfect.

01:19:08.100 --> 01:19:09.600
There they are.

01:19:10.400 --> 01:19:11.600
Frank!

01:19:17.700 --> 01:19:19.100
Hard left!

01:20:10.900 --> 01:20:12.100
Oh, Frank.

01:20:26.100 --> 01:20:27.600
Hey, I told you I'd be here.

01:20:28.400 --> 01:20:30.800
You didn't tell me they'd be using
guided missiles.

01:20:31.100 --> 01:20:33.400
All right. So there were
a few flaws in my plan.

01:20:33.600 --> 01:20:35.600
A few flaws?

01:20:36.200 --> 01:20:38.700
- I'm sorry about your truck.
- It's all in a day's work.

01:20:38.900 --> 01:20:41.900
- Hey, nice attitude.
- Look!

01:20:42.100 --> 01:20:44.800
- I'm gonna kill those guys!
- Run them down.

01:21:18.800 --> 01:21:20.700
All right, slim.

01:21:24.000 --> 01:21:26.400
They're gonna feel
that in the morning.

01:21:32.500 --> 01:21:35.000
Freeze. This is a citizen's arrest.

01:21:36.500 --> 01:21:38.300
Give me that.

01:21:38.900 --> 01:21:41.800
I'm an attorney. Give me a call.

01:21:47.400 --> 01:21:49.500
Slim, you think I could get me
one of them?

01:21:49.700 --> 01:21:52.100
Hell, thanks for the lift.

01:21:52.300 --> 01:21:56.000
- Thank you.
- My pleasure.

01:21:56.300 --> 01:21:59.700
- It's been a hoot, slim.
- All right. Take care.

01:22:01.200 --> 01:22:03.700
I hope you got a permit
for that fire, Dooley.

01:22:05.700 --> 01:22:08.500
That's funny. Still got a good
sense of humor, captain.

01:22:08.700 --> 01:22:12.500
- Captain, do you know my partner--?
- Cut the crap. What's this all about?

01:22:12.700 --> 01:22:14.900
Not much, really.

01:22:15.100 --> 01:22:18.300
Just that we're prepared to give
sworn testimony to a grand jury...

01:22:18.500 --> 01:22:21.400
...concerning a criminal conspiracy
between Michael Carlino...

01:22:21.600 --> 01:22:25.400
...a couple cops, various employees
of IMOC Industries.

01:22:25.800 --> 01:22:27.900
And where is Michael Carlino now?

01:22:28.100 --> 01:22:30.000
- Right here.
- Yeah, right here.

01:22:30.300 --> 01:22:31.400
- Come on.
- Drop the gun.

01:22:31.700 --> 01:22:34.200
I'll tell you anything you need
to know about him.

01:22:34.400 --> 01:22:36.000
Get him out of here!

01:22:36.200 --> 01:22:40.200
- You're gonna pay for this, Clarence.
- You're gonna pay!

01:22:40.700 --> 01:22:42.100
You're gonna pay!

01:22:46.100 --> 01:22:48.300
I'll be back!
It's your vendetta!

01:22:51.200 --> 01:22:56.400
Dooley, you are a disgrace to this
or any other uniform, you know that?

01:22:58.800 --> 01:23:03.000
So I guess we'll have to put you in
plain clothes when we bring you back.

01:23:03.200 --> 01:23:06.800
You mean that? I'm back? Will that
involve a raise or a promotion?

01:23:07.200 --> 01:23:08.600
Not a chance.

01:23:08.800 --> 01:23:11.100
Yeah, you got quite a girl here,
captain.

01:23:11.400 --> 01:23:14.100
Take your hands off her.

01:23:14.300 --> 01:23:16.400
- Norm.
- Yeah.

01:23:16.600 --> 01:23:18.500
Call me.

01:23:18.800 --> 01:23:21.200
- You mean it?
- Yeah.

01:23:21.400 --> 01:23:23.300
Sure.

01:23:24.300 --> 01:23:27.400
- So you're his partner.
- Yeah, that's right.

01:23:27.600 --> 01:23:31.500
You interested in police work?
We could use a good man.

01:23:32.500 --> 01:23:34.900
No, it's very flattering,
but I'm an attorney.

01:23:35.200 --> 01:23:36.900
- He's interested.
- I'm not interested.

01:23:37.100 --> 01:23:38.900
- You're gonna be a good cop.
- I'm not.

01:23:39.100 --> 01:23:40.900
- A great cop.
- He's lost his marbles.

01:23:41.200 --> 01:23:43.000
Why are you saying I wanna
be a cop?

01:23:43.200 --> 01:23:44.600
Because you're gonna be a cop.

01:23:44.700 --> 01:23:46.900
If I say you're gonna be a cop,
you'll be one.

01:23:47.100 --> 01:23:49.600
Well, I'm sorry,
I don't wanna be a cop.

01:27:27.800 --> 01:27:29.800
