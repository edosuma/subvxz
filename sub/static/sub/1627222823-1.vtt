00:00.215 --> 00:02.965
(dramatic music)

00:10.597 --> 00:13.180
(upbeat music)

01:19.084 --> 01:21.834
(birds chirping)

01:45.837 --> 01:49.004
(car engine roaring)

02:07.630 --> 02:09.430
- I'm fine, no really, don't get up.

02:14.030 --> 02:15.770
- Trouble at work sweetie?

02:15.820 --> 02:18.100
- Oh, you know, life of a chicken mogul.

02:18.150 --> 02:20.590
They're rolling out a new
fried giblet bowl next week.

02:20.640 --> 02:23.043
And they want all the employees to try it.

02:23.899 --> 02:25.470
It looks like shit.

02:25.520 --> 02:26.420
Smells like shit too,

02:26.470 --> 02:29.200
but I figured you'll
pretty much anything so.

02:29.250 --> 02:30.580
- Give it here pussy.

02:35.992 --> 02:38.909
- What the fuck are you staring at?

02:44.875 --> 02:45.690
Seems kind of late in the semester

02:45.740 --> 02:47.880
to be moving in don't you think?

02:47.930 --> 02:48.920
- Who gives a shit?

02:48.970 --> 02:49.970
Just enjoy the show.

02:51.709 --> 02:54.542
(mid tempo music)

03:26.377 --> 03:28.960
(man groaning)

03:34.090 --> 03:35.420
No one's ever rented that place.

03:35.470 --> 03:37.463
The owners wants too much if you ask me.

03:39.340 --> 03:40.123
- Who gives a shit?

03:40.173 --> 03:41.520
They seem like don't mind it.

03:49.337 --> 03:51.140
- We should go help 'em.

03:51.190 --> 03:53.872
- [Man] Hey girls, do you
need some help with that?

03:53.922 --> 03:55.460
- Hey, you guys need a hand?

03:55.510 --> 03:58.573
- Hi, actually I think we're okay.

03:58.623 --> 04:00.710
Hey, I got it.

04:00.760 --> 04:02.313
- Don't worry about it, I got it.

04:02.363 --> 04:04.699
Don't worry, I'll pick it up.

04:04.749 --> 04:05.749
- Oh my God.

04:07.751 --> 04:08.868
- You guys are awesome.

04:08.918 --> 04:10.251
- No, we got it.

04:14.180 --> 04:16.363
- Fucking figures, forget about it.

04:17.810 --> 04:21.200
They're probably some snobby
ass sorority bitches anyways.

04:21.250 --> 04:22.700
Definitely out of our league.

04:24.420 --> 04:26.010
- How do you figure?

04:26.060 --> 04:29.840
- Bro, come on, chicks
like them don't fuck

04:29.890 --> 04:30.673
with guys like us.

04:30.723 --> 04:32.030
It's just straight up facts.

04:33.130 --> 04:36.240
- Dude, we're two guys
and they're two chicks.

04:36.290 --> 04:37.620
You gotta back out there sometime.

04:37.670 --> 04:38.503
Why not now?

04:39.640 --> 04:41.340
- Yeah, yeah, look,
they're probably all about

04:41.390 --> 04:42.963
that Greek life hoe shit, man.

04:45.125 --> 04:48.600
The way they look, probably
some rich ass bitches too.

04:48.650 --> 04:51.180
Definitely don't dig swines like us.

04:51.230 --> 04:52.960
- You're looking at it wrong, okay?

04:53.010 --> 04:55.730
You're in college and I just
joined the workforce early,

04:55.780 --> 04:57.280
climbing up the corporate ladder.

04:57.330 --> 04:59.679
Two enterprising dudes
looking for a good time.

04:59.729 --> 05:04.350
- (laughing) Okay, one, I'm
flunking community college.

05:04.400 --> 05:06.603
Two, you smell like old chicken grease.

05:07.890 --> 05:10.040
Look, fuck it, let's just go smoke a bowl,

05:10.960 --> 05:12.910
play some shooty dudes on the Flex Box.

05:14.890 --> 05:15.960
I get first.

05:16.010 --> 05:18.510
- Split-screen.
- Dude, hot seat only.

05:18.560 --> 05:19.380
You know how it is.

05:19.430 --> 05:20.980
- Dude, fuck that noise, you kill.

05:21.030 --> 05:22.350
Plus I need to level up my character.

05:22.400 --> 05:23.830
You play that shit all day.

05:23.880 --> 05:27.357
- Fine, fine, fine, stop being
a whiny ass bitch about it.

05:33.436 --> 05:35.474
This fried giblet ain't too bad.

05:35.524 --> 05:37.620
Gravy's not bad either.

05:37.670 --> 05:39.501
- There isn't any gravy.

05:39.551 --> 05:42.301
(birds chirping)

05:45.655 --> 05:48.238
(upbeat music)

07:02.812 --> 07:03.645
Goddamn.

07:09.225 --> 07:11.975
(dramatic music)

07:16.790 --> 07:19.180
- Dude, can you just let
it go or some shit, man.

07:19.230 --> 07:21.800
Come on, just grab a
tube sock and some lube

07:21.850 --> 07:23.253
and just yank it right here.

07:24.470 --> 07:26.250
- You would just love that.

07:26.300 --> 07:27.330
You just wanna stare at my dong

07:27.380 --> 07:30.420
and have some for your spank
bank later you sick fuck.

07:30.470 --> 07:31.940
- Shit yeah dawg.

07:31.990 --> 07:33.330
I mean, we can go storm chasing,

07:33.380 --> 07:35.110
find ourselves a good tornado.

07:35.160 --> 07:37.970
We can have a good old cyclone jerk.

07:38.020 --> 07:40.730
That sounded really bad,
but you know what I mean.

07:40.780 --> 07:43.917
And then after that, mother
nature can take its rest.

07:43.967 --> 07:45.270
- What the fuck is wrong with you dude?

07:45.320 --> 07:50.150
- So many things, but seriously
dude, out of our league.

07:50.200 --> 07:52.750
Please, please, stop looking
through that door like a creep.

07:52.800 --> 07:53.830
I mean there's plenty
of fish out in the sea.

07:53.880 --> 07:56.480
- Yeah, yeah, but not those fish.

07:56.530 --> 07:58.923
- Those fish ain't into guys like us.

08:00.820 --> 08:03.101
- You don't know what the fuck
you're talking about. Okay.

08:04.110 --> 08:06.000
You're just too much of a
pussy to get off your ass

08:06.050 --> 08:07.023
and give it a shot.

08:08.250 --> 08:09.510
- Dude, what the fuck man?

08:09.560 --> 08:11.750
You're being a real
fucking asshole right now.

08:11.800 --> 08:13.783
I can go across the street
and nail one of the girls

08:13.833 --> 08:15.450
if I wanted to, okay.

08:15.500 --> 08:17.090
What are you gonna do huh?

08:17.140 --> 08:19.240
Bring them some leftover chicken or what?

08:19.290 --> 08:23.353
You make minimum wage
with a crappy ass car.

08:24.400 --> 08:26.693
You make it seem like you
have something to offer them.

08:28.873 --> 08:29.656
(door slams shut)

08:29.706 --> 08:31.320
- [Derek] Fuck you, man.

08:31.370 --> 08:32.440
At least I'm willing.

08:32.490 --> 08:33.400
- Willing to do what?

08:33.450 --> 08:35.820
Waste my time talking about
two girls you don't even know.

08:35.870 --> 08:37.860
Two girls that don't even know you exist.

08:37.910 --> 08:39.910
All you're doing is just
looking through that door,

08:39.960 --> 08:42.060
looking like a serial killer or some shit.

08:43.491 --> 08:46.140
- Dude, fuck you, okay.

08:46.190 --> 08:47.800
I just said that I was
gonna give it a shot

08:47.850 --> 08:49.913
and I'm not fucking lazy like you.

08:50.880 --> 08:51.963
It's been six months.

08:53.310 --> 08:56.520
- Don't.
- Six fucking months.

08:56.570 --> 08:58.506
You and Cherie have been broken up for,

08:58.556 --> 09:01.980
no fuck that, it wasn't a
break up, she dumped your ass.

09:02.030 --> 09:03.050
- It wasn't like that.

09:03.100 --> 09:05.170
- It was exactly like that. Okay?

09:05.220 --> 09:06.207
Now, you don't even go to school.

09:06.257 --> 09:08.080
You just sit at home
and smoke weed all day

09:08.130 --> 09:09.583
in that dirty ass bathrobe.

09:10.810 --> 09:12.260
- You don't know shit man.

09:12.310 --> 09:13.770
You know I have anxiety.

09:13.820 --> 09:15.450
You're being a fucking dick right now.

09:15.500 --> 09:17.569
- No Chad, I'm being your fucking friend.

09:17.619 --> 09:19.710
In fact, I'm being the last
fucking friend you're gonna

09:19.760 --> 09:20.750
have.

09:20.800 --> 09:22.481
Believe me, it's hard to fucking do

09:22.531 --> 09:24.610
because you walk around this fucking house

09:24.660 --> 09:26.190
with a storm cloud all over your head

09:26.240 --> 09:28.560
and I get home from work and
try to cheer your ass up,

09:28.610 --> 09:31.020
but bro, you've been a
real fucking downer lately.

09:31.070 --> 09:33.310
- Well, if you don't like it,
then get the fuck out man,

09:33.360 --> 09:34.150
like I give a shit.

09:34.200 --> 09:35.860
- Yeah, that's the fucking problem.

09:35.910 --> 09:38.610
You act like you don't give a
shit about anything anymore.

09:38.660 --> 09:41.640
There are messages piling
up on that fucking machine.

09:41.690 --> 09:42.710
You don't even go to school anymore.

09:42.760 --> 09:46.280
You're on fucking academic
probation for non attendance.

09:46.330 --> 09:49.240
And not to mention, the
fucking bill collectors

09:49.290 --> 09:51.803
that are calling for tuition all damn day.

09:52.870 --> 09:55.050
- Screw that noise, man.

09:55.100 --> 09:58.270
They can't get blood
out of a stoner right?

10:03.041 --> 10:05.647
Look man, just, I get it, I'm sorry.

10:05.697 --> 10:07.905
Look, it's just I'm working on it.

10:07.955 --> 10:09.028
And

10:09.078 --> 10:09.911
Dude, just

10:11.500 --> 10:12.619
Look, just hit this man.

10:12.669 --> 10:14.283
Just, don't you wanna get high?

10:17.930 --> 10:20.560
Dude, come on just hit this,
shoot some dudes with me.

10:20.610 --> 10:24.090
Look, I got the split screen
ready so you can level up

10:24.140 --> 10:25.737
- No man, I'm fucking tired okay.

10:25.787 --> 10:27.290
I have morning shift tomorrow.

10:27.340 --> 10:29.443
The drive through is a fucking bitch.

10:32.010 --> 10:34.193
- Dude, com on, Derek!

10:35.240 --> 10:40.240
Fuck, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

10:48.111 --> 10:50.778

11:37.000 --> 11:39.710

We'll get back to the

11:45.270 --> 11:47.450
But first, Langley Police
Department has asked us

11:47.500 --> 11:49.590
to broadcast this important message.

11:49.640 --> 11:52.520
Two men are missing, 22
year old James Van Der Fluke

11:52.570 --> 11:55.230
and 23 year old Jack Joshua
had been reported missing

11:55.280 --> 11:57.900
from their fraternity
house late last week.

11:57.950 --> 11:59.500
If you have seen these two men,

11:59.550 --> 12:00.333
please report it

12:00.383 --> 12:02.220
to the Langley Police
Department immediately.

12:02.270 --> 12:03.510
This next hit has been brought to you

12:03.560 --> 12:05.560
by Mr. Cluck-Clucks Fried Chicken.

from Sorority Sigma Lamda
Upsilon Tau coming in

12:14.670 --> 12:16.900
to talk about their new charity drive.

12:16.950 --> 12:17.733
Maybe I can get 'em

12:17.783 --> 12:19.080
to shake their young firm giblets

12:19.130 --> 12:22.485
for me (laughs), oh yeah.

16:16.004 --> 16:16.787
I don't need it for my class.

16:16.837 --> 16:18.703
I brought the receipts.

16:24.150 --> 16:24.970
- It's past 30 days.

16:25.020 --> 16:26.770
I can't take these for a refund.

else we can do with that?

16:46.260 --> 16:48.330

16:48.380 --> 16:51.190
These are now out of date
and we don't take those.

16:51.240 --> 16:52.960

16:53.010 --> 16:55.453
I spent $600 on these.

This is trash.

Nope, nothing.

- Come on, step up the stairs.

19:39.020 --> 19:41.520
Oh, we're gonna have some fun.

19:52.790 --> 19:54.533
- Chad is full of fucking shit.

19:55.720 --> 19:57.903
Dude, that guy is old enough
to be their fucking dad.

20:02.290 --> 20:05.443
Fuck it!
(door slams shut)

20:07.182 --> 20:09.932
(dramatic music)

20:49.172 --> 20:52.672
That's right baby girl, no one's watching.

21:07.760 --> 21:09.763
- That's not so bad is it?

21:19.554 --> 21:23.887
Now, just stay put and let
the drugs do their thing.

21:29.480 --> 21:32.663
I'm gonna take such good care of you,

21:35.913 --> 21:36.746
dirty boy.

21:38.591 --> 21:40.182
(flesh cutting)

22:18.864 --> 22:21.447
(gentle music)

23:00.100 --> 23:01.380
- Welcome to Sapiens,

23:01.430 --> 23:03.430
how many will be dining with us tonight?

23:04.680 --> 23:07.380
- Hey Cherie, party for two.

23:07.430 --> 23:10.138
Look, I was just walking
by and I just saw you

23:10.188 --> 23:11.814
I just wanted to come say hi

23:11.864 --> 23:16.390
and see if we can talk,
sit down and talk about us.

23:16.440 --> 23:17.273
You know.

23:18.408 --> 23:21.240
- What do you mean us?

23:21.290 --> 23:23.552
There is no us Chad.

23:23.602 --> 23:24.459
- Yeah, I know.

23:24.509 --> 23:28.598
I just thought we can, you
know, maybe fix things.

23:28.648 --> 23:30.815
- You don't get it do you?

23:32.451 --> 23:33.290
- [Chad] I don't get what? I just

23:33.340 --> 23:34.730
- I broke up with you.

23:34.780 --> 23:36.323
What, like a year ago?

23:37.280 --> 23:38.707
- It's actually six months,
two weeks, and a day

23:38.757 --> 23:39.937
but who's counting, right?

23:39.987 --> 23:42.730
- Okay, it is sad that you
know the specifics of the date,

23:42.780 --> 23:45.890
but whatever, I broke up with you.

23:45.940 --> 23:47.980
Get over it.

23:48.030 --> 23:51.275
I honestly don't need
you stalking me anymore.

23:51.325 --> 23:52.108
- I wasn't stalking.

23:52.158 --> 23:53.710
I was just checking up on you.

23:53.760 --> 23:57.270
- You call standing outside my work

23:57.320 --> 24:00.213
and hiding in the bushes at
school checking up on me?

24:02.250 --> 24:03.033
For the love of God,

24:03.083 --> 24:06.100
I thought the restraining order was enough

24:06.150 --> 24:08.083
to get rid of you.

24:08.133 --> 24:11.000
- It did, it's just I thought
you were playing a game

24:11.050 --> 24:12.670
of cat and mouse with me.

24:12.720 --> 24:14.695
But now, I can't even go to school until

24:14.745 --> 24:16.200
you you know, you graduate.

24:16.250 --> 24:18.705
Look, Derek got into my head
and just was talking to me.

24:18.755 --> 24:20.838
And just look, I just thought about you.

24:21.960 --> 24:24.170
- You thought what?

24:24.220 --> 24:26.410
What were you thinking Chad?

24:26.460 --> 24:29.520
That after all the stalking
and mental harassment

24:29.570 --> 24:34.265
that you would what, come in
here and rekindle the romance?

24:34.315 --> 24:36.710
- Look, I know I'm not a
smooth talker, but come on,

24:36.760 --> 24:39.677
I treated you right didn't I?

24:39.727 --> 24:40.627
The sex was great?

24:43.763 --> 24:47.330
Treated me right is stalking me?

24:47.380 --> 24:49.920
And we had sex like what, once?

24:49.970 --> 24:53.100
And it was the worst
30 seconds of my life.

24:53.150 --> 24:55.800
- Time was going slow, I
thought it was a minute.

24:55.850 --> 24:58.550
- That is so sad Chad.

24:58.600 --> 25:01.380
You are such a creep.

25:01.430 --> 25:03.373
Just get a grip and move on.

25:04.600 --> 25:07.750
There was never an us.

25:07.800 --> 25:12.493
We were never together and
we will never be together.

25:13.470 --> 25:16.130
So can you like get the fuck out

25:16.180 --> 25:17.320
or I'm calling the cops.

25:17.370 --> 25:18.380
- Look Cherie, I'm just-

25:18.430 --> 25:21.500
- Hey, hey, hey, is
this guy bothering you?

25:21.550 --> 25:24.040
- Yes.
- Well hey, hey-

25:24.090 --> 25:25.260
- We're just talking, okay?

25:25.310 --> 25:26.373
Just no trouble.

25:28.480 --> 25:30.280
- Oh, keep working on those,
you'll catch up to me soon.

25:30.330 --> 25:33.930
Listen, big guy listen, you
can't come in here okay?

25:33.980 --> 25:36.120
You know you were told
you can't be here, right?

25:36.170 --> 25:37.700
So let's get to stepping

25:37.750 --> 25:40.080
before I show you I
put the man in manager.

25:40.130 --> 25:43.110
- Oh, okay.
- Yeah.

25:43.160 --> 25:45.260
- This is-
- Let's go, lets' go.

25:45.310 --> 25:47.583
That's right, that's right.

25:48.662 --> 25:49.495
(Chad grunts)

25:51.194 --> 25:53.244
This time, you're gonna fucking stay out.

26:00.420 --> 26:02.843
- Fuck you dude.
- [Manager] Loser!

26:03.895 --> 26:05.893
- You okay, man?
- Get off me!

26:20.869 --> 26:22.119
Can I help you?

26:46.490 --> 26:49.503
Derek?
(door slams shut)

26:53.686 --> 26:54.519
Derek?

27:28.556 --> 27:31.466
(door slams shut)

27:31.516 --> 27:33.016
Good for you, man.

27:57.081 --> 28:02.081
(birds chirping)
(phone ringing)

28:41.030 --> 28:42.303
Hey, Derek!

28:43.285 --> 28:45.202
You up yet you d-bag?

28:48.905 --> 28:49.738
Derek?

29:02.595 --> 29:04.081
(door slams shut)

29:04.131 --> 29:07.906
(peeing)

29:31.089 --> 29:33.756
(message beeps)

29:36.828 --> 29:39.495
(message beeps)

29:40.530 --> 29:43.197
(message beeps)

30:24.302 --> 30:27.302
(tap water running)

30:29.048 --> 30:31.715
(message beeps)

30:33.545 --> 30:36.212
(message beeps)

31:13.896 --> 31:16.479
(Chad gagging)

31:19.233 --> 31:22.650
(fridge doors slam shut)

31:26.663 --> 31:29.413
(birds chirping)

31:45.557 --> 31:48.390
(door slams shut)

31:58.485 --> 32:01.068
(upbeat music)

33:15.779 --> 33:17.145
- You've gotta get over here.

33:17.195 --> 33:18.862
It's fucking awesome, come on.

33:30.409 --> 33:32.076
- [Chrissy] Hi.
- Hi.

33:34.217 --> 33:35.733
- [Chad] Hey there again.

33:38.210 --> 33:40.795
- Oh, hi, hi, hi.

33:40.845 --> 33:43.448
- Hi, I'm Chrissy.

33:43.498 --> 33:44.773
- Hi, I'm Chrissy.

33:45.840 --> 33:47.223
- No, that's my name?

33:50.411 --> 33:52.330
- Oh, my name is Shit.

33:55.190 --> 33:56.930
- Your name is Shit?

33:56.980 --> 33:59.360
You must have some pretty cool parents.

33:59.410 --> 34:01.780
- No, no, I mean, my name's
not Shit of course not.

34:01.830 --> 34:05.343
I mean, unless you like that sort of shit.

34:06.920 --> 34:10.398
- So what is it?
- What's what?

34:10.448 --> 34:12.830
- Your name?
- My name?

34:12.880 --> 34:14.460
Oh shit, no, no it's not shit.

34:14.510 --> 34:18.483
It's just Chad, just
Chad, no shit, no shit.

34:19.460 --> 34:23.160
- Well, nice to meet you just Chad.

34:23.210 --> 34:25.407
You got another one of those for me?

34:25.457 --> 34:27.620
- Oh no, it's my last one.

34:27.670 --> 34:28.453
You can have it,

34:28.503 --> 34:32.213
but it's a little warm if you
like it like that I guess.

34:33.100 --> 34:36.800
- I'm good, but tell you what,

34:36.850 --> 34:40.894
why don't you come over
for some a little later?

34:40.944 --> 34:44.950
I think my sister is still
got a bunch in the fridge

34:45.000 --> 34:46.080
you know, since you're out.

34:47.080 --> 34:50.768
And it's cold, so that's nice.

34:50.818 --> 34:52.503
- Yeah, I'm down with that little, yeah.

34:52.553 --> 34:53.793
A little later?

34:54.910 --> 34:57.403
- A little later tonight.

34:58.837 --> 34:59.837
- All right.

35:19.067 --> 35:21.900
(door slams shut)

35:23.783 --> 35:26.116
What the fuck just happened?

35:34.169 --> 35:36.752
(gentle music)

35:42.699 --> 35:43.880
- Are you kidding me?

35:43.930 --> 35:46.150
Jesus, Chrissy, not again.

35:46.200 --> 35:47.703
You can't do this to us again.

35:48.790 --> 35:50.690
I am knee deep in this shit over here.

35:51.550 --> 35:52.913
I need you to focus.

35:55.640 --> 35:57.390
- Why can't we do something I want?

35:59.080 --> 36:01.500
We always do what you want.

36:01.550 --> 36:05.990
Why can't I do something
that makes me happy?

36:06.040 --> 36:09.663
- All this, everything we've
been doing, it's for you.

36:10.960 --> 36:12.510
You think money grows on trees?

36:13.370 --> 36:15.860
You wanted a better life.

36:15.910 --> 36:18.910
You wanted to run away
from the institution.

36:18.960 --> 36:20.560
You wanted to get away from dad.

36:21.470 --> 36:22.993
You wanted to go to college.

36:23.830 --> 36:25.480
- I didn't wanna do it like this.

36:26.740 --> 36:30.583
- Chrissy, the shit I had
to do to relocate us again,

36:31.450 --> 36:34.913
the shit I had to do to get
us new identities twice.

36:36.260 --> 36:40.173
- I didn't wanna hurt
anybody, anybody else.

36:41.470 --> 36:42.483
- Dad deserved it.

36:44.104 --> 36:44.887
He was a pig.

36:44.937 --> 36:45.770
They all are.

36:48.580 --> 36:51.990
- Not Chad, he is different.

36:52.040 --> 36:53.190
- [Janet] No, he isn't.

36:55.869 --> 36:59.644
- He is, you'll see.

37:00.600 --> 37:02.310
- Whatever, time to stop fucking around

37:02.360 --> 37:03.240
and get back to work.

37:03.290 --> 37:04.790
Grab the mop and bucket.

37:04.840 --> 37:06.480
I mean, if you're not too busy.

37:18.574 --> 37:21.157
(upbeat music)

37:31.129 --> 37:34.129
(tap water running)

40:39.630 --> 40:40.413
- Look, hey dude.

40:40.463 --> 40:42.430
Look, I'm sorry for leaving
here on another voicemail.

40:42.480 --> 40:45.283
Look, I'm just calling
just to check in, man.

40:46.496 --> 40:47.740
Look, I know we haven't
talked since the other night,

40:47.790 --> 40:50.680
but I hope you're good.

40:50.730 --> 40:52.080
And I get it that you're pissed at me,

40:52.130 --> 40:56.663
but you're right, I was wrong.

40:59.501 --> 41:00.983
And I'm taking your advice.

41:02.700 --> 41:05.483
Get off my ass and try to live a little.

41:07.582 --> 41:09.590
Look, can you just
please call me back, man?

41:27.555 --> 41:30.472
(knocking on door)

41:36.307 --> 41:41.307
- Oh!
(upbeat music)

41:49.793 --> 41:51.623
I don't remember ordering a stud.

41:55.270 --> 41:57.570
- Is Chrissy home?

42:00.840 --> 42:02.960
- Chrissy is not here right now.

42:03.010 --> 42:04.360
Can I do something for you?

42:06.290 --> 42:08.380
Oh, don't be shy.

42:08.430 --> 42:10.730
Any friend of my sister's
is a friend of mine.

42:16.490 --> 42:17.940
Don't you wanna be my friend?

42:20.110 --> 42:23.903
Come on, don't you wanna come inside?

42:30.618 --> 42:32.737
- I got to shave my cat.

42:37.744 --> 42:38.850
(door slams shut)

42:38.900 --> 42:41.067
- Wash my cat, the fuck?

42:43.694 --> 42:46.043
♪ I played my hand and showed my cards ♪

42:46.093 --> 42:48.736
♪ I took my togs right from your heart ♪

42:48.786 --> 42:51.007

42:51.057 --> 42:53.785

42:53.835 --> 42:56.502
(phone ringing)

43:52.577 --> 43:55.160
(Chad farting)

43:59.986 --> 44:02.736
(birds chirping)

44:37.021 --> 44:39.688
(phone ringing)

44:47.008 --> 44:52.008
- Dammit, ass butt!
(fridge doors shut open)

44:57.388 --> 45:00.555
(phone message beeps)

45:08.240 --> 45:10.140
- [Chad's Mom] Chad, it's mom.

45:10.190 --> 45:12.310
I haven't heard from you in weeks.

45:12.360 --> 45:14.620
The school has been calling too.

45:14.670 --> 45:16.990
Are you okay with all the things

45:17.040 --> 45:18.480
that have been going on over there

45:18.530 --> 45:20.400
and then those boys missing?

45:20.450 --> 45:22.860
Just give me a call would you please?

45:22.910 --> 45:25.657
Your father and I are
worried sick, love you.

45:43.160 --> 45:45.663
- [Operator] Yep, Langley
Campus Police Department.

45:45.713 --> 45:47.019
Is this an emergency?

45:47.069 --> 45:49.150
- No, I don't think so.

45:49.200 --> 45:51.090
- [Operator] How can we help, sir?

45:51.140 --> 45:53.950
- Yeah, my friend, he
didn't come home last night

45:54.000 --> 45:55.520
or the night before.

45:55.570 --> 45:59.610
- [Operator] Is he a student?
- No, we just live off campus

45:59.660 --> 46:02.790
so the off campus police
is the only number I have.

46:02.840 --> 46:05.720
- [Operator] Okay sir, so
how old is your friend?

46:05.770 --> 46:07.390
Is he your roommate?

46:07.440 --> 46:08.688
- 23, I think so.

46:08.738 --> 46:10.870
Yeah, yeah, he is my roommate.

46:10.920 --> 46:13.180
- [Operator] So he's been
missing for two nights then?

46:13.230 --> 46:16.003
Approximately what time did he go missing?

46:16.053 --> 46:19.180
- About midnight, two nights ago.

46:19.230 --> 46:22.060
He was with this girl and
he seemed pretty trashed.

46:22.110 --> 46:25.840
- [Operator] Okay look,
honestly, he is probably fine.

46:25.890 --> 46:28.810
Guys that age take off all the time

46:28.860 --> 46:30.910
for sometimes days on end.

46:30.960 --> 46:34.200
We really can't make a missing
persons report until an adult

46:34.250 --> 46:36.590
has been missing for at least 48 hours.

46:36.640 --> 46:40.093
- Okay then, okay, fine, sorry.

46:43.000 --> 46:45.303
Dude, where the hell are you?

46:57.981 --> 47:00.731
(birds chirping)

47:21.840 --> 47:25.513
- Hey, where were you?

47:26.562 --> 47:27.580
- [Chad] Oh, hey.

47:27.630 --> 47:29.373
- Last night, you didn't come?

47:30.666 --> 47:33.105
- Last night, yeah, I did come by.

47:33.155 --> 47:35.230
Your sister said that
you left or something.

47:35.280 --> 47:37.373
I mean, it's no big deal.

47:38.350 --> 47:43.350
- Oh yeah, silly me, I totally
forgot I had an errand to run

47:45.420 --> 47:47.980
for school and yeah, you're right.

47:48.030 --> 47:49.140
I am so sorry.

47:49.190 --> 47:51.050
I totally forgot about that.

47:51.100 --> 47:51.883
- Oh, it's cool.

47:51.933 --> 47:53.883
I mean, I got stuff
that I needed to do too.

47:55.250 --> 47:58.690
- I hope you weren't really disappointed

48:00.790 --> 48:02.623
because I kind of was.

48:03.632 --> 48:04.423
You know?

48:04.473 --> 48:08.265
I was really looking
forward to our little date.

48:09.195 --> 48:11.331
- Yeah, I was looking forward to it too.

48:11.381 --> 48:13.510
I mean, I would've stayed and waited,

48:13.560 --> 48:15.360
but your sister just...

48:16.260 --> 48:21.260
- Janet can be a little extra, sorry.

48:22.570 --> 48:25.180
But I will definitely be home tonight

48:26.293 --> 48:30.928
if you wanna come over again I mean?

48:30.978 --> 48:32.134
- Yeah, yeah, I'm down.

48:32.184 --> 48:33.990
I mean, yeah, I can come
by a little bit later

48:34.040 --> 48:35.886
if that's cool.

48:35.936 --> 48:36.950
I'm just gonna go get dressed

48:37.000 --> 48:40.058
and get ready then I'll be there.

48:40.108 --> 48:41.275
- It's a date.

48:44.161 --> 48:46.741
Oh, and for the record,

48:46.791 --> 48:50.791
I think you look just fine
just the way you are right now.

49:00.718 --> 49:03.301
(upbeat music)

50:34.648 --> 50:37.642
(knocking on door)

50:37.692 --> 50:38.692
- Hey!
- Hey.

50:39.569 --> 50:41.145
- Are those for me?

50:41.195 --> 50:43.445
- Yeah, yeah, I mean, yeah.

50:45.575 --> 50:47.820
- Oh my God, where'd you get them?

50:47.870 --> 50:50.820
- Well, I don't have the car
and I didn't want you to wait.

50:52.070 --> 50:55.415
I just picked him up on the way over.

50:55.465 --> 50:57.540
You know, I thought of you

50:59.182 --> 51:00.227
I thought you'd like 'em.

51:01.330 --> 51:02.830
- On the way over?

51:02.880 --> 51:05.963
- Yeah, I just got them
on the neighbor's yard.

51:07.722 --> 51:08.882
I mean, they're not gonna use 'em

51:08.932 --> 51:10.591
and I don't think they're
gonna complain to us.

51:10.641 --> 51:12.200
They're renters, but they're
probably gonna get destroyed

51:12.250 --> 51:13.800
in the next party or something.

51:15.231 --> 51:16.331
- They're very sturdy.

51:17.410 --> 51:20.190
They're perfect, thank you.

51:20.240 --> 51:21.590
I'm gonna go put them in a vase, come on.

51:21.640 --> 51:23.340
Make yourself comfortable.

51:23.390 --> 51:24.418
Come on in.

51:24.468 --> 51:25.548
They're plastic. Okay cool.

51:28.510 --> 51:30.813
[Chrissy] Beer?
- Yeah, sure.

51:32.497 --> 51:34.664
- [Chrissy] Cool, one sec.

51:56.771 --> 52:01.560
(chuckling) Yeah, we, you know,
college girls, jello shots.

52:01.610 --> 52:04.093
Janet loves cherry.

52:06.660 --> 52:08.953
Come on, get comfortable over here.

52:11.720 --> 52:13.970
- Oh, this is a lot of
cool stuff you have.

52:22.630 --> 52:23.630
This is really cool.

52:26.420 --> 52:28.330
- I learned it in wood shop.

52:28.380 --> 52:29.502
- Cool, so you built this?

52:29.552 --> 52:32.593
- Yeah, I got really into archery.

52:33.559 --> 52:35.713
You know, It really helped
me at the institution.

52:38.521 --> 52:39.927
- Yeah. I hated high school too.

52:43.990 --> 52:45.203
- I knew you'd get me.

52:48.520 --> 52:52.163
- Oh this is good, really needed it.

52:53.210 --> 52:56.550
- Yeah I mean, I figured you'd
been gone for at least a day

52:56.600 --> 52:57.680
you know, with your friend.

52:59.036 --> 53:00.283
- How'd you know?

53:01.400 --> 53:06.030
- Oh, his car. His car has
been gone for a full day.

53:06.080 --> 53:08.270
He came over to hang out
with Janet the other night,

53:08.320 --> 53:11.973
but he never came back
after the first night.

53:16.340 --> 53:20.510
We figured it was because
of the fight you guys had.

53:20.560 --> 53:22.470
We don't mean to pry,

53:22.520 --> 53:26.810
but you guys were a
little loud that's all.

53:26.860 --> 53:28.580
- Yeah. No, you're right.

53:28.630 --> 53:32.590
I mean, just think he's at his
parents' house or something.

53:32.640 --> 53:34.040
He'll probably show up in the morning,

53:34.090 --> 53:39.090
but yeah, we just tend
to fight all the time.

53:39.205 --> 53:40.790
I mean, kind of like
an old married couple,

53:40.840 --> 53:43.333
but we always make up afterwards.

53:54.150 --> 53:56.547
Sorry, it's not you-
- No, it's okay.

53:59.228 --> 54:01.180
I get it.
- It's not you.

54:01.230 --> 54:02.346
It's not you.

54:02.396 --> 54:04.840
I mean, it's just I don't open up

54:04.890 --> 54:05.893
to people most of the time.

54:05.943 --> 54:09.840
I mean, it's been a
while, so it's just me.

54:09.890 --> 54:13.020
- Why don't I get you a refill

54:14.150 --> 54:16.650
and we'll start over, sound good?

54:16.700 --> 54:18.760
- Yeah, that sounds great.

54:18.810 --> 54:20.520
- Okay, I'll be right back.

54:31.810 --> 54:33.860
- Do you know where your restroom's at?

54:33.910 --> 54:35.043
- Oh yeah, definitely.

54:36.830 --> 54:38.030
First door on your left.

54:44.230 --> 54:46.980
(dramatic music)

55:05.120 --> 55:06.261
- This time you got this.

55:06.311 --> 55:08.561
You got this, you got this.

55:24.282 --> 55:25.887
(toy squeaking)

55:25.937 --> 55:28.520
(man groaning)

55:32.445 --> 55:33.917
(door creaks open)

55:33.967 --> 55:37.103
- Hey tiger.
(toy squeaking)

55:51.131 --> 55:55.630
- Chrissy, I think I'm gonna
be heading home a little bit.

55:55.680 --> 55:57.257
I'm not feeling good.

55:58.205 --> 55:59.045
I'm not feeling good.

56:04.090 --> 56:05.890
- We were just starting to have fun.

56:16.155 --> 56:17.650
I don't think you're in any condition

56:17.700 --> 56:19.867
to go anywhere sweetheart.

56:23.721 --> 56:25.221
- What did you do?

56:27.150 --> 56:29.220
- Okay, maybe you're right.

56:29.270 --> 56:31.450
I threw everything at him and nothing.

56:31.500 --> 56:32.283
He didn't even wanna stay

56:32.333 --> 56:34.916
and watch me and roofie guy in there.

56:34.966 --> 56:36.710
Are you sure he's not gay?

56:36.760 --> 56:38.670
- He didn't want you.

56:38.720 --> 56:41.280
And he didn't wanna watch
because he is different.

56:41.330 --> 56:43.603
- Oh, he's different?
- He's special.

56:45.340 --> 56:49.600
I will say, the new roofies
this guy is giving you,

56:49.650 --> 56:51.433
I thought they only worked
like that in the movies.

56:51.483 --> 56:52.880
- I know!
- They're so much faster

56:52.930 --> 56:53.960
that what we've been using.

56:54.010 --> 56:57.170
- I know, better than
a bat that's for sure.

56:57.220 --> 56:58.660
- Wait, he was getting away.

56:58.710 --> 56:59.520
He saw you.

56:59.570 --> 57:01.150
He was a pervert.

57:01.200 --> 57:02.300
- Look, if you kill him first,

57:02.350 --> 57:04.110
we can't get as much out of him.

57:04.160 --> 57:05.740
Buyers need 'em fresh.

57:05.790 --> 57:07.180
It doesn't matter how.

57:07.230 --> 57:08.013
Look, he's almost done.

57:08.063 --> 57:10.763
We can pack him up, take
roofie guy up there next.

57:12.170 --> 57:13.080
He is huge though.

57:13.130 --> 57:14.670
Not sure how we're gonna get him upstairs

57:14.720 --> 57:16.020
without taking his IV out.

57:16.960 --> 57:18.720
- Okay but, before we
take your other guy out,

57:18.770 --> 57:20.640
we've got to find out
where he buys his stuff.

57:20.690 --> 57:23.550
- Agreed, I wonder if it's
good for the liver though.

57:23.600 --> 57:25.850
The liver's our biggest money maker.

57:25.900 --> 57:28.280
Okay, pack him up, let's go.

57:39.237 --> 57:41.987
(dramatic music)

58:12.560 --> 58:14.690
- Hey, hey, hey, don't move, don't move.

58:15.870 --> 58:17.863
You're gonna pinch your wrists.

58:18.740 --> 58:20.200
You gotta be quiet all right?

58:20.250 --> 58:23.163
You don't want my sister
to know that you're awake.

58:24.617 --> 58:26.700
She's so wrong about you.

58:28.390 --> 58:31.823
She thought you'd run
like my last boyfriend.

58:34.459 --> 58:36.495
That's why we had to leave.

58:36.545 --> 58:40.460
That's why we had to come here.

58:40.510 --> 58:44.930
She's pissed because she had
had to get fake identities,

58:44.980 --> 58:48.290
and fake college credits and all of that.

58:50.940 --> 58:54.510
Now, she is pissed, but
she was wrong about you.

58:55.940 --> 58:57.140
You would never hurt me.

59:00.153 --> 59:02.153
You would never leave me.

59:07.870 --> 59:11.080
As soon as we take care of
that so call friend of yours,

59:11.130 --> 59:13.207
he is no friend of yours.

59:14.205 --> 59:15.122
He's a pig.

59:24.720 --> 59:27.053
I will be back soon my love.

1:00:02.673 --> 1:00:07.673
(clock ticking)
(ominous music)

1:00:43.588 --> 1:00:46.338
(Derek groaning)

1:01:28.592 --> 1:01:31.045
- God, his tolerance is crazy.

1:01:31.095 --> 1:01:33.595
Remind me to stay clear of
chronic potheads in the future.

1:01:34.890 --> 1:01:36.270
(Derek groaning)

1:01:36.320 --> 1:01:38.533
Would you shut the fuck up!

1:01:47.092 --> 1:01:51.525
(Derek groaning)

1:01:53.868 --> 1:01:56.025
- [Chrissy] I think we have some aspirin.

1:01:56.075 --> 1:01:57.300
It's in here somewhere.

1:01:57.350 --> 1:01:58.490
- [Janet] Are you kidding me?

1:01:58.540 --> 1:01:59.560
Get your ass back here.

1:01:59.610 --> 1:02:03.913
You're the reason we have
a pile of men around here.

1:02:03.963 --> 1:02:07.796
You should have to do
some of your dirty work.

1:02:10.790 --> 1:02:13.503
- Where do I start?

1:02:14.510 --> 1:02:16.060
- Come on, where the spleen is.

1:02:18.680 --> 1:02:20.090
- Where is that?

1:02:20.140 --> 1:02:23.250
- Have you not paid attention
to anything I've been doing?

1:02:23.300 --> 1:02:24.420
- I guess, I don't know.

1:02:24.470 --> 1:02:25.600
- Jesus, Chrissy, this is

1:02:25.650 --> 1:02:28.070
why you're barely passing your classes.

1:02:28.120 --> 1:02:29.890
You know no one's gonna
hire you in the real world

1:02:29.940 --> 1:02:31.439
if you can't hold-

1:02:31.489 --> 1:02:33.942
- You're the one who's
supposed to be pre-med.

1:02:33.992 --> 1:02:38.110
Look, I'm the looks and
you're the brains, remember?

1:02:38.160 --> 1:02:39.660
- Sure, yeah, I guess

1:02:39.710 --> 1:02:41.300
that's why you're a liberal arts major.

1:02:41.350 --> 1:02:42.380
- [Chrissy] No fair, I like it.

1:02:42.430 --> 1:02:44.750
- It's useless.
- [Chrissy] Whatever.

1:02:44.800 --> 1:02:46.100
- Can we just get started?

1:02:52.134 --> 1:02:54.050
- Where?

1:02:54.100 --> 1:02:55.520
- Upper left that the abdomen.

1:02:55.570 --> 1:02:57.463
God!
- [Chrissy] Okay, jeez!

1:03:00.720 --> 1:03:01.885
- [Janet] His left, not your left!

1:03:01.935 --> 1:03:02.768
- Okay, look!

1:03:07.676 --> 1:03:10.092
(Derek groaning)

1:03:14.364 --> 1:03:15.697
- Wait, hold on.

1:03:16.741 --> 1:03:21.741
- I'm on the left side
which is the right side.

1:03:23.950 --> 1:03:24.733
What is it?

1:03:24.783 --> 1:03:25.823
What could it possibly be?

1:03:28.713 --> 1:03:30.373
- Is that my top you're wearing?

1:03:34.384 --> 1:03:35.650
- No, it's mine.

1:03:35.700 --> 1:03:36.773
- Like hell it is.

1:03:36.823 --> 1:03:39.330
I have been searching
for that top for weeks.

1:03:39.380 --> 1:03:40.700
I even asked if you had seen it.

1:03:40.750 --> 1:03:43.063
- You asked if I had seen your pink top.

1:03:43.930 --> 1:03:47.220
I thought you were asking
if I had seen your pink top,

1:03:47.270 --> 1:03:48.437
not this pink top.

1:03:49.690 --> 1:03:50.500
- That is mine.

1:03:50.550 --> 1:03:51.333
- No, it's not.

1:03:51.383 --> 1:03:52.530
You gave this one to me.

1:03:52.580 --> 1:03:53.910
- I would've never given it to you.

1:03:53.960 --> 1:03:55.370
I let you borrow it.

1:03:55.420 --> 1:03:56.890
It looks way better on me.

1:03:56.940 --> 1:03:58.890
- As if, and you did.

1:03:58.940 --> 1:03:59.920
You said I could have it.

1:03:59.970 --> 1:04:01.770
Remember that frat party last month?

1:04:02.660 --> 1:04:05.240
- Yeah, and you said you
had nothing cute to wear.

1:04:05.290 --> 1:04:07.050
- I wanted to wear my lighter pink one,

1:04:07.100 --> 1:04:09.749
but I got blood all over it.

1:04:09.799 --> 1:04:12.373
- When you were trying to get
rid of that fat guy's torso.

1:04:12.423 --> 1:04:16.167
(Janet and Chrissy laughing)

1:04:16.217 --> 1:04:18.004
Oh, that's so fucking disgusting.

1:04:18.054 --> 1:04:20.170
- Oh, you were gonna blow him.

1:04:20.220 --> 1:04:22.800
- I was not, that's fucking gross.

1:04:22.850 --> 1:04:24.950
- [Chrissy] You were, I saw it.

1:04:25.000 --> 1:04:27.600
- I had to get down there to
get close to a visible vein.

1:04:27.650 --> 1:04:28.750
I had no other choice.

1:04:31.910 --> 1:04:36.688
- What was it like being under
all that fromunder cheese?

1:04:36.738 --> 1:04:38.232
- [Janet] Fucking gross.

1:04:38.282 --> 1:04:39.935
- I bet he smelled like
an Italian sub down there.

1:04:39.985 --> 1:04:41.104
- Can you not?

1:04:41.154 --> 1:04:42.737
I'm gonna throw up.

1:04:45.810 --> 1:04:48.730
Well, before we cut into this asshole,

1:04:48.780 --> 1:04:51.202
why don't we take our shirts
off so we don't get blood

1:04:51.252 --> 1:04:52.893
on these ones too?
- Totally, makes sense.

1:05:06.120 --> 1:05:08.054
Oh, you should fold them though.

1:05:08.104 --> 1:05:09.340
- What, why?

1:05:09.390 --> 1:05:12.040
- They're gonna get wrinkled
and misshapen like that.

1:05:13.150 --> 1:05:13.983
- Whatever.

1:05:16.819 --> 1:05:19.569
(Dramatic music)

1:05:33.587 --> 1:05:38.004
- Unbelievable, okay, you
are about to get dissected.

1:05:39.926 --> 1:05:41.253
- Vivisected.

1:05:41.303 --> 1:05:45.790
- Whatever, you are about to die

1:05:45.840 --> 1:05:49.627
and this is what you're thinking about?

1:05:50.896 --> 1:05:55.350
Incredible!
- I told you dear sister,

1:05:55.400 --> 1:05:57.420
they are all the same.

1:05:57.470 --> 1:05:58.470
Let's do it already.

1:06:06.203 --> 1:06:08.870
(heart beating)

1:06:16.381 --> 1:06:17.548
- Ah, oh fuck!

1:06:22.178 --> 1:06:23.523
I think I got some in my mouth.

1:06:23.573 --> 1:06:26.623
- [Chrissy] I think I
hit the artery thingy.

1:06:27.807 --> 1:06:28.807
- You think?

1:06:30.150 --> 1:06:31.263
Oh shit, shit!

1:06:39.818 --> 1:06:40.860
The fuck are you looking at?

1:06:40.910 --> 1:06:42.457
Go, do something.

1:06:57.506 --> 1:06:59.672
(Derek groans)

1:07:26.784 --> 1:07:30.117
- Chad, Chad, don't worry, I can fix it.

1:07:41.382 --> 1:07:46.382
Janet was right about you
just like all the others,

1:07:46.428 --> 1:07:49.340
just like all the others.

1:07:51.723 --> 1:07:54.556
You were supposed to be different.

1:07:55.650 --> 1:07:58.293
You were never supposed to leave me.

1:08:01.402 --> 1:08:05.606
You were supposed to love me.

1:08:05.656 --> 1:08:07.906
Why don't you love me Chad?

1:08:12.196 --> 1:08:13.829
Crossbow clicking

1:08:15.498 --> 1:08:17.331
Why don't you love me?

1:08:18.544 --> 1:08:21.544
(suspenseful music)

1:08:23.465 --> 1:08:25.876
Why don't you love me Chad?

1:08:25.926 --> 1:08:26.759
Why?

1:08:28.928 --> 1:08:31.339
- Chrissy, look at me.

1:08:31.389 --> 1:08:32.400
Your sister's wrong.

1:08:32.450 --> 1:08:33.885
She's wrong about me.

1:08:33.935 --> 1:08:35.260
I am different.

1:08:35.310 --> 1:08:36.143
You know me.

1:08:38.280 --> 1:08:40.595
I'm not gonna leave. I'm right here

1:08:43.069 --> 1:08:45.152
- You're not gonna leave?

1:08:49.900 --> 1:08:51.110
And you love me?

1:08:51.160 --> 1:08:52.270
You do love me?

1:08:58.917 --> 1:08:59.750
Liar!
