All right,
let's keep talking it out...

00:48.048 --> 00:49.848
Has the jury
reached its verdict?

00:49.850 --> 00:51.016
We have, Your Honor.

01:00.361 --> 01:02.027
Peter, what's
with the tie?

01:02.029 --> 01:04.063
Oh, I bought a tie so I can
loosen it when I'm beat.

01:04.065 --> 01:05.164
(sighs heavily)

01:05.166 --> 01:06.165

01:06.167 --> 01:07.499
Oh, my God, Dad!

01:12.740 --> 01:14.506
Peter, I think
what everyone's saying

01:14.508 --> 01:16.041
is that you've
got "dad breath."

01:16.043 --> 01:17.376
What the hell's
"dad breath"?

01:17.378 --> 01:18.410
You know,
"dad breath."

attention to hygiene,

01:21.082 --> 01:22.848

are changing...

01:22.850 --> 01:24.750
It's just a fact that,
at a certain age,

01:24.752 --> 01:27.019

01:27.021 --> 01:28.220

01:28.222 --> 01:29.555
I don't smell it.

01:29.557 --> 01:30.889
Huh. Maybe that
explains what happened

01:30.891 --> 01:32.558

at work today.

01:32.560 --> 01:34.193

Hey, there's gonna be a quiz
on all this later.

01:40.234 --> 01:41.433
I'm just kidding.

01:41.435 --> 01:42.768
Someone said that
to me once,

01:42.770 --> 01:44.269

Hey, Lois,

Hi, there.

01:58.085 --> 01:59.451

05:16.450 --> 05:18.650
that Quahog founder
Miles "Chatterbox" Musket

05:18.652 --> 05:21.420
hid his fortune
in fear of it being taken

05:21.422 --> 05:23.789

during the Revolutionary War.

05:23.791 --> 05:25.991
He died before
he could retrieve it,

05:25.993 --> 05:28.126
and left behind only this map.

05:28.128 --> 05:30.595

is still buried

05:30.597 --> 05:32.864
right here in Rhode Island.

05:36.636 --> 05:38.970
Okay, I'm gonna
go do diarrhea,

Well, what if there is?

05:50.951 --> 05:52.651
Ah, see?
Surprised you with that one.

05:52.653 --> 05:54.820
You see, you see that rock
next to the "X"?

05:54.822 --> 05:57.122
I know that rock, Lois--
it's right near Route 2.

05:57.124 --> 05:59.825
I'm finding that treasure.
Peter, the map
is a joke.

05:59.827 --> 06:01.493
You're being played

whatever happened to that guy
Marty from high school?

06:06.967 --> 06:09.000
Don't know.
Never saw him after the prom.

06:09.002 --> 06:12.671
Really? Sure you didn't
run into him, oh, say,
about 16 years ago?

06:12.673 --> 06:14.673
George, what are
you talking about?

06:14.675 --> 06:16.808
I'm talking about
the fact that our son,

06:16.810 --> 06:19.010
who you insisted we name
after that guy Marty,

06:19.012 --> 06:20.512
looks exactly like him!

06:20.514 --> 06:22.714
You think I'm an idiot?
That I wouldn't notice

06:22.716 --> 06:26.151

fire to the living room rug!

06:29.189 --> 06:31.757

06:38.499 --> 06:40.198
What? What are you
talking about?

06:40.200 --> 06:41.900
Well, this child's
place mat is telling me

06:41.902 --> 06:43.535

by the side of the highway.

buried out there!

but it looks like

08:04.785 --> 08:06.818
it's a clue
to where the treasure is.

08:06.820 --> 08:08.820
"Face the circle

out the clue at our Web site:

clue, and then go out in
the waiting room and...

08:59.006 --> 09:01.172
maybe start lowering
expectations.

09:01.174 --> 09:02.307
Treasure?!

09:02.309 --> 09:03.341
Yeah, baby?

09:03.343 --> 09:05.343
Bring me a grape wine.

09:05.345 --> 09:06.378
Peter, what the hell!

09:06.380 --> 09:07.512
Now everyone has the clue!

09:07.514 --> 09:08.813
Why would you do that?

09:08.815 --> 09:10.348
Because I'm tired
of people saying

09:10.350 --> 09:12.050
I don't know nothin'.
Everyone doubted me,

09:12.052 --> 09:14.519
so I wanted to rub it
in their faces that I was right.

09:14.521 --> 09:15.720
All right, where is it?

09:15.722 --> 09:17.188
Give me that!
Is this all there was?

09:17.190 --> 09:18.490
Yeah, is there
anything else

09:18.492 --> 09:19.858
we should know before
we start looking?

09:19.860 --> 09:21.560
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
This is <i>our</i> thing.

09:21.562 --> 09:23.194
We're not sharing
this with anyone.

09:23.196 --> 09:24.996
Peter, come on,
are you serious?

09:24.998 --> 09:27.499
If Joe or I found this, we'd
want you right alongside us.

09:27.501 --> 09:29.568
Well, yeah, we're
like peas in a pod.

09:29.570 --> 09:31.536
Wait-wait.
Don't go in there.

09:31.538 --> 09:33.705
He's doing his podcast.

09:33.707 --> 09:34.706
Oh, that's cute.

09:34.708 --> 09:37.008
Now, <i>that</i> I like.

09:37.010 --> 09:39.244
What do you think about <i>this,</i>
<i>you old bag?</i>

09:39.246 --> 09:41.513
Oh, no.

09:41.515 --> 09:43.548
Look, you guys
doubted me, mocked me,

09:43.550 --> 09:45.717
constantly handled my Eggo
despite my clear instructions,

09:45.719 --> 09:47.886
and now you want a
piece of my treasure?

09:47.888 --> 09:50.989
I don't think so.
Well, fine!
We don't need you anyway!

09:52.058 --> 09:53.692
Peter, I don't like this.

09:53.694 --> 09:55.060
It seems like this treasure

09:55.062 --> 09:56.561
is already turning people
against each other.

09:56.563 --> 09:57.896
Hang on, you guys.

09:57.898 --> 09:59.564
I think I might have
figured something out.

09:59.566 --> 10:01.199
"The circle in the square."

10:01.201 --> 10:03.568
That could be the clock
in the town square.

10:03.570 --> 10:05.904
Wow, that... You're right!
Brian, that could be it!

10:05.906 --> 10:08.306
Well, let's get down there
before anyone else does.

10:13.245 --> 10:16.448
(townspeople murmuring)

10:16.450 --> 10:18.750
Son of a bitch!
Everyone's already here!

10:18.752 --> 10:21.786
Let's see, "Face
the circle in the square."

10:21.788 --> 10:23.788
"Face the circle."

10:23.790 --> 10:25.056
"Face."

10:25.058 --> 10:26.891
Okay, the gesturing
needs to stop.

10:26.893 --> 10:28.660
No one else is doing that.

10:32.431 --> 10:34.399
Look!
When you face this way,

10:34.401 --> 10:37.502
you're looking at
the statue of Miles Musket.

10:39.071 --> 10:40.972
Crap, you guys, there's
already other people here.

10:40.974 --> 10:42.774
They must have
figured it out, too.

10:42.776 --> 10:44.442
You're right.
Okay, gather round, kids.

10:44.444 --> 10:45.577
Family suicide.

10:45.579 --> 10:46.811
Look-- there's a plaque!

10:46.813 --> 10:49.447
"This square
shall forever honor

10:49.449 --> 10:51.149
"the memory of my son,
Timmy Musket.

10:51.151 --> 10:53.451
"Always a chip
off the old Block.

10:53.453 --> 10:54.953
"May he rest in peace.

10:54.955 --> 10:56.955
Miles 'Chatterbox' Musket."

10:56.957 --> 10:59.824
Wait-- when I played Jane Musket
in the school play

10:59.826 --> 11:01.459
the last three weekends--
thanks for coming...

11:01.461 --> 11:03.128
I couldn't.
I had a thing.

11:03.130 --> 11:04.996
I had a lot of
dog stuff that day.

11:04.998 --> 11:07.132
Yeah, weekends I like
to spend with my kids.

11:07.134 --> 11:08.967
I learned that
Timmy Musket is buried

11:08.969 --> 11:10.635
in a cemetery
on Block Island.

11:10.637 --> 11:12.504
I remember it because
my big speech was, "Timmy..."

11:12.506 --> 11:13.972
Meg, please.

11:13.974 --> 11:15.807
That must be what "chip off
the old Block" means!

11:15.809 --> 11:17.609
That's it!
Meg, take the car home!

11:17.611 --> 11:20.478
Your mother and I are taking
the ferry to Block Island!

11:20.480 --> 11:22.480
Chris, we need to find that
treasure for ourselves.

11:22.482 --> 11:23.682
What do you mean?

11:23.684 --> 11:25.283
Even <i>if</i> Dad finds
the treasure,

11:25.285 --> 11:26.317
he's not gonna share.

11:26.319 --> 11:27.652
He'll just blow
through it all.

11:27.654 --> 11:28.987
Maybe you're right.

11:28.989 --> 11:30.622
I mean, last time
we came into some money,

11:30.624 --> 11:31.956
he just wasted it
on all those

11:31.958 --> 11:33.158
diamond pinkie rings
for everybody.

11:33.160 --> 11:34.526
What?!

11:34.528 --> 11:37.062
Uh, well, uh, yeah,
we should probably go.

11:38.998 --> 11:40.298
(tires screeching)

11:40.300 --> 11:41.666
What the hell?
Where are they going?

11:41.668 --> 11:42.834
Oh, forget them.
They're dead weight.

11:42.836 --> 11:44.335
If this treasure's going
to be found,

11:44.337 --> 11:45.704
it's up to you
and me, Brian.

11:45.706 --> 11:47.505
What do you mean?
Come on! You think

11:47.507 --> 11:49.140
the fat man's gonna
figure out those clues?

11:49.142 --> 11:51.176
He's an idiot.
Yeah, I guess
you're right.

11:51.178 --> 11:52.677
Yes, I mean,
he's the guy

11:52.679 --> 11:54.546
who put all those
little bald men in incubators

11:54.548 --> 11:55.980
because he thought
they were babies.

11:55.982 --> 11:57.515
Look at you.

11:57.517 --> 11:59.851
You came early,
but you're gonna make it.

11:59.853 --> 12:02.687
I'm a senior vice president
at an investment firm!

12:02.689 --> 12:05.757
Oh, someone's a fussy britches.

12:21.040 --> 12:23.374
♪ Sailing

12:23.376 --> 12:25.543
♪ Takes me away

12:25.545 --> 12:27.579
♪ To where I've always

12:27.581 --> 12:30.115
♪ Heard it could be...

12:34.086 --> 12:35.754
Want half a Mounds bar?

12:35.756 --> 12:37.188
What?

12:37.190 --> 12:38.423
Who eats a Mounds bar?

12:38.425 --> 12:40.425
I do.
My whole life,
I don't think

12:40.427 --> 12:42.694
I've ever seen a single
person eat a Mounds bar.

12:42.696 --> 12:44.562
Well, you're about
to see one now.

12:44.564 --> 12:45.930
So, you walk
into a store,

12:45.932 --> 12:47.565
you see the hundreds
of options for candy,

12:47.567 --> 12:49.234
and you choose
a Mounds bar?

12:49.236 --> 12:50.235
Yep.

12:50.237 --> 12:51.736
So what is it you like?

12:51.738 --> 12:52.871
The coconut?
The chocolate?

12:52.873 --> 12:54.038
Yeah.
Both those things.

12:54.040 --> 12:55.406
How long you been
eating 'em?

12:55.408 --> 12:56.908
Uh, I've probably
been having a Mounds bar

12:56.910 --> 12:59.110
two or three times a day
for the last 25 years.

12:59.112 --> 13:00.779
Geez, no wonder
you can't walk!

13:00.781 --> 13:02.781
You have total
renal shutdown!

13:02.783 --> 13:04.215
Your kidneys are
drowning in a stew

13:04.217 --> 13:05.383
of chocolate and coconut!

13:05.385 --> 13:06.618
Give me that!

13:09.255 --> 13:10.588
(candy wrapper crinkling)

13:10.590 --> 13:12.323
What are you doing?

13:14.560 --> 13:17.228
Why are your nipples
poking into me?

13:17.230 --> 13:19.397
Sorry. That happens
when I'm cold.

13:19.399 --> 13:21.299
But why are there
three of them?

13:21.301 --> 13:22.133
There aren't.

13:22.135 --> 13:23.434
Two of them are moles.

13:23.436 --> 13:26.171
Those numbers
still don't add up!

13:28.941 --> 13:30.942
Why the hell are we taking
a hot air balloon?

13:30.944 --> 13:32.944
I don't think we're anywhere
near Block Island.

13:32.946 --> 13:34.813
Oh, I know.
We passed that miles ago.

13:34.815 --> 13:36.948
What? Well, then what
about the treasure?

13:36.950 --> 13:40.084
Two friends sailing in
the sky in a wicker basket

13:40.086 --> 13:42.620
with a strange man
holding a cheese plate?

13:42.622 --> 13:44.322
This is the treasure, Bri.

13:44.324 --> 13:45.957
You want a Vicodin?

13:45.959 --> 13:48.793
Isn't it dangerous to do drugs
10,000 feet in the air?

13:48.795 --> 13:50.829
Yeah. Exactly.

13:50.831 --> 13:52.096
What the hell?!

13:52.098 --> 13:54.098
Never gonna die!

13:54.100 --> 13:55.800
Your friend is, like,
the coolest guy

13:55.802 --> 13:57.735
I've ever had up here.

13:59.805 --> 14:01.806
Oh, damn it, Lois,
they're already here!

14:01.808 --> 14:03.474
This is all your fault!

14:03.476 --> 14:04.943
What?! How is this my fault?

14:04.945 --> 14:07.011
Because you just had
to stop for ice cream!

14:07.013 --> 14:08.947
Then you get in there,
and you order

14:08.949 --> 14:10.682
like you never
heard of food before!

14:10.684 --> 14:14.519
Oh, "Coffee Fudge Swirl with
Reese's Peanut Butter Cups."

14:14.521 --> 14:16.688
Oh, I wonder
what's in that!

14:16.690 --> 14:18.857
You just listed off
all the ingredients!

14:18.859 --> 14:21.759
Everything you just said
is what's in that!

14:23.495 --> 14:25.363
Well, I hate to say it,
but I guess

14:25.365 --> 14:26.998
we're supposed
to dig this kid up.

14:27.000 --> 14:28.199
Any volunteers?

14:28.201 --> 14:29.968
I dig kids.

14:29.970 --> 14:31.302
All of you,
hold it right there!

14:31.304 --> 14:32.537
If anyone's digging

14:32.539 --> 14:33.838
into this little kid's grave,
it's me!

14:33.840 --> 14:35.306
You're too late.
We got here first.

14:35.308 --> 14:36.507
No, it's my treasure hunt!

14:36.509 --> 14:37.675
I found the first clue!

14:37.677 --> 14:39.043
You guys are just horning in!

14:39.045 --> 14:40.311
You guys, calm down!

14:40.313 --> 14:42.046
See, this is what
I was talking about.

14:42.048 --> 14:43.481
You can't desecrate
a child's grave!

14:43.483 --> 14:44.682
Don't worry, Lois.

14:44.684 --> 14:46.017
We're gonna do it
with reverence.

14:46.019 --> 14:47.685
Hey, how about
a little digging song?

14:47.687 --> 14:50.021
(to "Little Bunny Foo Foo"):
♪ Little Peter Griffin

14:50.023 --> 14:51.556
♪ Diggin' up a casket

14:51.558 --> 14:54.826
♪ Shovelful of dirt
and bop ya on the head. ♪

14:54.828 --> 14:56.728
I didn't care for
the end of that song.

14:56.730 --> 14:58.897
Oh, my God!
The treasure's
in the casket!

14:58.899 --> 15:01.199
Come on, Meg,
let's get it!

15:01.201 --> 15:02.333
My treasure!

15:02.335 --> 15:04.903
Oh, my God!
You hit your own son!

15:04.905 --> 15:06.537
That's it, Peter.

15:06.539 --> 15:09.240
I am not gonna stand here
and be a part of this madness.

15:09.242 --> 15:11.376
You're on your own,
because I quit!

15:11.378 --> 15:13.077
Chris, Meg,
we're going home.

15:13.079 --> 15:16.014
Well, good! You were just
slowing me down anyway!

15:16.016 --> 15:18.216
You, Asian lady,
you're the new Lois.

15:18.218 --> 15:22.587
I will have one scoop of mint
chocolate chip in a waffle cone.

15:22.589 --> 15:25.323
You are a practical,
straightforward people.

15:31.196 --> 15:33.231
What do you guys think
is in here?

15:33.233 --> 15:34.432
(rattling)

15:34.434 --> 15:36.134
Sounds like books.

15:36.869 --> 15:38.102
(all gasping)

15:38.104 --> 15:40.605
BRUCE:
Oh, my God!

15:40.607 --> 15:42.907
Feels so weird to be
looking at a dead kid

15:42.909 --> 15:44.575
and not have angry
parents nearby.

15:44.577 --> 15:47.745
Hey, look! There's something
written inside the lid.

15:47.747 --> 15:50.882
PETER:
"You've crossed the miles,
you've pawed through clues.

15:50.884 --> 15:54.919
Find where he hits, misses,
cheers and boos."

15:54.921 --> 15:57.255
By the way, for those
who came on my boat,

15:57.257 --> 15:58.790
I have those
sandwiches.

15:58.792 --> 16:01.726
"Hits, misses,
cheers, and boos."

16:01.728 --> 16:03.594
Could be... baseball?

16:03.596 --> 16:05.229
And "pawed through clues."

16:05.231 --> 16:07.265
Could it be Paw... tucket?

16:07.267 --> 16:09.901
The Pawtucket Red Sox play
at McCoy Stadium.

16:09.903 --> 16:12.470
Quagmire, let's get
to that stadium!

16:16.608 --> 16:17.942
Eh! Lois took the bike.

16:17.944 --> 16:19.744
Hey, wait a minute.

16:19.746 --> 16:23.181
This is a great time for me
to do my Suzuki Samurai promo!

16:24.616 --> 16:26.484
Are you a Hawaii scumbag?

16:26.486 --> 16:29.120
Do you chug energy drinks
in Arizona?

16:29.122 --> 16:33.691
Suzuki Samurai--
ninja name, garbage car.

16:37.162 --> 16:39.297
You sons of bitches,
this is my...

16:39.299 --> 16:41.666
(yelling, grunting
and muttering)

16:44.470 --> 16:46.437
Oh, my God, look at 'em.

16:46.439 --> 16:47.972
Lois was right.

16:47.974 --> 16:50.842
This treasure hunt has
turned them all into animals.

16:50.844 --> 16:52.310
(grunting)

16:52.312 --> 16:53.978
There's more
where that came from, mister!

16:53.980 --> 16:55.146
(grunts)

16:55.148 --> 16:57.749
He was right.
There <i>was</i> more!

17:01.653 --> 17:04.288
Oh, look who's back--
the grave robber.

17:04.290 --> 17:05.656
Hey, Lois.

17:05.658 --> 17:07.859
So, what happened?
You find your treasure?

17:07.861 --> 17:10.661
No. I realized something
after you left.

17:10.663 --> 17:12.663
It's not the treasure
that matters.

17:12.665 --> 17:14.966
All that really matters
is the money you get

17:14.968 --> 17:16.834
in   <i>exchange</i>
<i>for the treasure.</i>

17:16.836 --> 17:19.170
I guess I had
to learn that the hard way.

17:19.172 --> 17:21.339
Peter, you were a real jerk
out there!

17:21.341 --> 17:22.640
I know.

17:22.642 --> 17:23.674
You were right.

17:23.676 --> 17:25.343
I took this thing way too far.

17:25.345 --> 17:27.879
And I'm really sorry about
how I treated you and the kids.

17:27.881 --> 17:29.047
But you know me.

17:29.049 --> 17:31.015
If I read anything
on a place mat,

17:31.017 --> 17:32.350
I just kind of go nuts.

17:32.352 --> 17:33.818
Can you forgive me?

17:33.820 --> 17:35.186
Chris forgave me.

17:35.188 --> 17:38.356
I can't wait for you
to fall asleep tonight.

17:38.358 --> 17:40.391
Of course I
forgive you, Peter.

17:40.393 --> 17:43.561
So I guess everyone else came
to their senses, too, huh?

17:43.563 --> 17:45.496
No, they all ran off
to McCoy Stadium.

17:45.498 --> 17:47.665
What? Why? What's
at McCoy Stadium?

17:47.667 --> 17:49.700
Ah, there was a clue
at the graveyard.

17:49.702 --> 17:51.502
Here, I took a picture
with my phone.

17:51.504 --> 17:53.171
Oh, it's the
next picture.

17:53.173 --> 17:56.274
Just swipe it
to the next one.

17:57.843 --> 17:59.710
She saw me.

17:59.712 --> 18:02.547
"You've crossed the miles,
you've pawed through clues.

18:02.549 --> 18:06.517
Find where he hits,
misses, cheers and boos."

18:06.519 --> 18:09.854
Peter, this can't be leading
them to a baseball stadium.

18:09.856 --> 18:12.690
Baseball wasn't invented
until the 1800s.

18:12.692 --> 18:14.859
Wow, you're really smart, Lois.

18:14.861 --> 18:16.928
You know, Peter,
in the first eight minutes

18:16.930 --> 18:18.763
of Meg's play,
before I walked out,

18:18.765 --> 18:21.732
they said Miles Musket
was a horrible drunk

18:21.734 --> 18:22.934
and a wife beater.

18:22.936 --> 18:24.735
So, when it says,
"hits, misses,"

18:24.737 --> 18:28.039
it might be talking
about hitting Mrs. Musket.

18:28.041 --> 18:29.907
And he probably misspelled
"missus"

18:29.909 --> 18:31.943
because he was drunk
when he wrote it.

18:31.945 --> 18:34.112
Or maybe he misspelled it
because cursive is hard,

18:34.114 --> 18:35.913
and everyone should
get off his back.

18:35.915 --> 18:38.549
And "cheers" and "boos"
might be referring to a bar

18:38.551 --> 18:41.385
where he would "cheers,"
and drink his "booze."

18:41.387 --> 18:43.955
"Hits missus,
cheers and booze."

18:43.957 --> 18:46.124
Wait a minute-- it's got
to be an old bar, right?

18:46.126 --> 18:47.892
The Clam's
the oldest bar in town.

18:47.894 --> 18:50.094
(gasps) That must be
where the treasure is!

18:50.096 --> 18:52.096
All right, let's you
put some makeup on

18:52.098 --> 18:53.998
and get right down
to The Clam!

18:56.401 --> 18:59.303
Oh, no, they're closed.

18:59.305 --> 19:01.105
Hang on. I got an idea.

19:01.107 --> 19:02.406
But you have to believe.

19:02.408 --> 19:04.275
What?
You have to believe.

19:04.277 --> 19:05.476
Say you believe.

19:05.478 --> 19:07.245
Okay. I believe.

19:07.247 --> 19:10.448
This is worse than the time
we were in The Clam right now.

19:10.450 --> 19:11.949
Yes!

19:11.951 --> 19:13.117
Peter, look!

19:13.119 --> 19:14.986
That's Miles Musket!

19:14.988 --> 19:16.621
It is?
Yes!

19:16.623 --> 19:18.923
How have you never seen
this painting before?

19:18.925 --> 19:21.826
Lois, I'm completely hammered
every time I'm in here.

19:25.597 --> 19:26.697
(grunts)

19:32.671 --> 19:34.205
(both gasp)

19:35.007 --> 19:36.641
We did it!

19:36.643 --> 19:38.643
We found the treasure!

19:38.645 --> 19:39.977
You know what, Peter?

19:39.979 --> 19:41.979
Why don't <i>you</i> open it?

19:41.981 --> 19:43.981
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

19:43.983 --> 19:46.317
No, okay,
I'll-I'll open it.

19:46.319 --> 19:49.420
Here, hold this.

19:59.498 --> 20:00.831
"Congratulations.

20:00.833 --> 20:02.867
"You have won
The Founding Father Restaurant

20:02.869 --> 20:04.535
"Treasure Hunt Challenge.

20:04.537 --> 20:06.170
"Please enjoy one free meal

20:06.172 --> 20:08.506
"at select
Founding Father locations.

20:08.508 --> 20:10.975
Expires May 16, 2006."

20:10.977 --> 20:12.677
Wait a second.
What year is it?

20:12.679 --> 20:14.512
It's 2013, Peter.

20:14.514 --> 20:16.147
So that's...
It's before.

20:16.149 --> 20:17.348
The coupon's no good.

20:17.350 --> 20:18.816
Oh, man!

20:18.818 --> 20:21.152
Um, this sucks worse

20:21.154 --> 20:23.688
than when I went
to that strip club without Lois.

20:23.690 --> 20:24.989
(dance beat thumping,
men whooping)

20:24.991 --> 20:26.624
Yay!

20:30.529 --> 20:32.697
Well, Peter, I hope
you're not disappointed

20:32.699 --> 20:34.031
we didn't find
any treasure.

20:34.033 --> 20:35.233
No, it's fine.

20:35.235 --> 20:36.667
You know, the important thing is

20:36.669 --> 20:38.502
we figured out
those clues together.

20:38.504 --> 20:40.538
I mean, so what
we won't be able to pay

20:40.540 --> 20:42.073
to fix them veins
in your legs.

20:42.075 --> 20:43.674
You're my treasure, Lois,

20:43.676 --> 20:46.410
and I want you
on my team for everything.

20:46.412 --> 20:48.045
Except for sports.

20:48.047 --> 20:49.413
Me too, Peter.

20:49.415 --> 20:50.715
I love you.

20:50.717 --> 20:52.583
I love you, too, Lois.

20:52.585 --> 20:54.652
(knocking on door)
No way that's the shrimp.
