WEBVTT

01:51.111 --> 01:54.155
Welcome to Hell!

02:03.206 --> 02:04.207
Nicholas?

02:14.801 --> 02:16.219
Sabrina.

02:18.555 --> 02:19.597
-Sabrina.
-Nick!

02:20.431 --> 02:21.349
Nick!

02:22.058 --> 02:23.101
Sabrina!

02:24.018 --> 02:26.479
-You shouldn't be here.
-Well, neither should you.

02:27.105 --> 02:27.939
Go!

02:28.940 --> 02:30.400
Before he comes back.

02:30.483 --> 02:31.734
Before who comes back?

02:36.781 --> 02:37.866
Your father!

02:41.911 --> 02:43.746
Leave, my lover.

02:50.211 --> 02:52.630
No, leave me. I'll only slow you down.

02:52.714 --> 02:53.882
Like heaven, I will.

03:15.278 --> 03:16.863
<i>Claudere portas mortis.</i>

03:40.511 --> 03:41.512
I love you, Nick.

03:41.596 --> 03:42.430
Oh, Sabrina.

03:44.515 --> 03:46.100
Daddy loves you too.

04:17.090 --> 04:19.509
All right, my children.
Everyone, sit down, please,

04:19.592 --> 04:21.678
and make a start. Clean plates, please.

04:21.761 --> 04:24.722
Okay, sit down, everyone. Hi, darling.
How did you sleep?

04:25.598 --> 04:29.227
-I slept okay, Aunt Hilda.
-Yeah, well, sit here, tuck in.

04:29.727 --> 04:34.065
Okay, so I have made
a proper English fry-up for breakfast.

04:34.148 --> 04:37.860
We have eggs and, uh, bacon,
fried bread, baked beans,

04:37.944 --> 04:40.405
grilled tomatoes,
and some delicious bangers.

04:40.488 --> 04:43.241
I thought we were having French toast
and strudel today?

04:43.324 --> 04:44.951
I beg your pardon?

04:45.910 --> 04:48.413
This is not a full-service restaurant.

04:48.997 --> 04:50.123
This is our home,

04:50.206 --> 04:52.875
whose doors
we graciously opened to you all

04:52.959 --> 04:55.503
after the collapse of the Church of Night

04:55.586 --> 04:58.214
at the hands of the villain,
Faustus Blackwood,

04:58.923 --> 05:01.301
at great personal cost I might add.

05:01.759 --> 05:05.054
Yet again, there was no hot water
for my bath this morning,

05:05.596 --> 05:08.641
which is why
I have an announcement to make.

05:10.393 --> 05:13.104
It's been a month.
You're sleeping on our floors.

05:13.187 --> 05:15.440
You're wearing clothes
made from our drapes.

05:15.898 --> 05:20.236
It is high time
to reopen the Academy of Unseen Arts

05:20.820 --> 05:24.282
and resume worship
in the Desecrated Church.

05:25.408 --> 05:28.578
-But who will be the Academy's director?
-What a question.

05:29.120 --> 05:31.080
I will, of course.

05:31.164 --> 05:32.248
Directrix.

05:32.874 --> 05:34.917
Well, who will say Black Mass for us?

05:39.505 --> 05:40.673
Never mind about that now.

05:41.174 --> 05:43.801
Once you've finished breakfast,
gather up your belongings.

05:43.885 --> 05:46.054
It will take many witches,
with many brooms,

05:46.137 --> 05:48.348
to make those places tiptop again.

05:52.226 --> 05:54.354
So who will say Black Mass,
do you reckon?

05:54.979 --> 05:57.857
And will you still be High Priestess,
like you said?

05:57.940 --> 05:58.941
And why not?

05:59.776 --> 06:02.612
I know the rites,
the sacraments, the scriptures.

06:02.695 --> 06:05.907
Well, then the question is,
who do we say Black Mass to?

06:05.990 --> 06:07.116
Not the Dark Lord.

06:07.700 --> 06:09.660
My so-called father
doesn't deserve our prayers,

06:09.744 --> 06:11.662
not after what he did to us.

06:11.746 --> 06:13.581
And what he continues to do to Nick.

06:15.249 --> 06:17.168
I should have never have let
Madam Satan take him.

06:17.251 --> 06:18.461
It's safer that way.

06:18.544 --> 06:19.921
For us, but what about for Nick?

06:20.463 --> 06:21.923
He's in Hell, suffering...

06:24.509 --> 06:27.136
and that is not right.

06:31.057 --> 06:32.058
Sabrina.

06:32.141 --> 06:33.476
Leave her be, Hilda.

06:34.352 --> 06:36.646
You can't coddle Sabrina on this one.

06:37.939 --> 06:40.024
You know why she leaves
early every morning, don't you?

06:40.108 --> 06:41.692
To go to those bloody gates.

06:42.527 --> 06:46.614
She probably sits there on her own,
in the dark,

06:47.740 --> 06:49.117
crying her little eyes out.

06:49.659 --> 06:53.121
<i>Sigils vicissim, sigils apertas.</i>

06:53.204 --> 06:55.957
<i>Sigils vicissim, sigils apertas.</i>

06:56.499 --> 06:58.126
<i>Sigils vicissim, sigils apertas.</i>

06:58.209 --> 06:59.168
'Brina?

07:00.920 --> 07:02.797
Just a couple more sequences, Harvey.

07:04.549 --> 07:05.383
Sure.

07:06.175 --> 07:09.429
I just don't want my dad or any
of his crew to catch us on the way out.

07:10.680 --> 07:11.514
Okay.

07:15.101 --> 07:16.352
Try again tomorrow.

07:17.728 --> 07:19.272
As many times as you want, Sabrina.

07:24.902 --> 07:26.863
Hey, can I ask you a question?

07:28.489 --> 07:32.285
What happens
if we do somehow get Nick out of Hell?

07:32.743 --> 07:33.953
He still has a...

07:34.912 --> 07:35.997
uh...

07:36.664 --> 07:38.040
Devil inside him, right?

07:39.083 --> 07:40.418
We'd find a better trap.

07:41.169 --> 07:43.463
A better prison for my father.

07:46.591 --> 07:48.342
You're amazing, you know that?

07:48.759 --> 07:50.219
Nick betrayed you,

07:51.179 --> 07:53.473
but you're still willing
to risk everything for him.

07:54.265 --> 07:56.350
It's not that simple, Harvey.

07:57.101 --> 07:59.312
When the Dark Lord asks you
to do something,

07:59.395 --> 08:02.565
if you're indebted to him,
as we witches are,

08:03.524 --> 08:05.902
or were, it's hard to say no.

08:08.571 --> 08:10.656
Still was a dick move if you ask me.

08:11.032 --> 08:11.866
Mmm.

08:22.835 --> 08:25.630
Isn't it a little early in the season
for ice cream?

08:43.856 --> 08:48.236
Spellman Sisters Mor-- Father Black--
Fastu-- How may I assist you?

08:54.951 --> 08:57.495
- How you doin', girl?

08:58.162 --> 08:59.497
Are you getting any sleep?

08:59.997 --> 09:03.084
Tons... in-between my nightmares.

09:03.834 --> 09:06.546
'Brina, you...
you can't keep going on like this.

09:07.380 --> 09:08.297
Like what?

09:08.381 --> 09:09.966
Like going to the gates every day.

09:10.049 --> 09:11.342
Well, you guys--

09:11.425 --> 09:13.719
We're not saying
you should give up on Nick.

09:13.803 --> 09:16.472
But you can't give up
on the rest of your life either.

09:16.556 --> 09:19.225
That's what I've been saying.
You should join our band.

09:19.350 --> 09:21.811
I'm not really in the mood
for singing these days, Harvey.

09:21.894 --> 09:26.399
Or, conversely, you could sign up
for cheerleading with me.

09:29.026 --> 09:29.986
You're not serious?

09:30.069 --> 09:31.195
Why not?

09:31.279 --> 09:34.198
I mean, we're 16, we love to dance,

09:34.282 --> 09:37.618
and I mean,
it can't be all hell, all the time.

09:37.702 --> 09:39.579
It's not all hell. It's all Nick.

09:45.334 --> 09:46.377
Ms. Wardwell,

09:47.795 --> 09:49.130
you're back?

09:49.213 --> 09:53.926
Indeed, Mr. Marlin,
after some much-needed time off.

09:54.010 --> 09:57.054
Not as principal anymore, but to teach.

09:57.638 --> 10:02.310
Mr. Garland informed me that lately,
you have been focusing on epic poetry.

10:02.393 --> 10:03.436
<i>Beowulf, </i>I believe.

10:03.519 --> 10:06.814
But the poem I find myself drawn to
these past few weeks

10:06.897 --> 10:08.274
is Dante's <i>Divine Comedy,</i>

10:08.357 --> 10:11.110
specifically his <i>Inferno,</i>

10:11.193 --> 10:13.904
detailing the poet's epic journey to Hell.

10:16.240 --> 10:18.659
There's an excerpt in your textbook.

10:20.077 --> 10:23.247
Who would like to lead the recitation?

10:30.129 --> 10:32.089
You see,
you have to put your back into it.

10:32.173 --> 10:34.133
Zelds. Oh, Zelds.

10:34.216 --> 10:38.137
Oh, look, sister, the false idol
has been smashed to rubble.

10:38.220 --> 10:40.973
Oh, delightful.
Can we have a chat for a minute?

10:41.057 --> 10:42.141
Thank you.

10:43.684 --> 10:48.522
The Council phoned,
they are convening an important meeting,

10:48.606 --> 10:51.192
and it is Father Blackwood's turn to host.

10:51.275 --> 10:52.818
Praise it to heaven.

10:52.902 --> 10:55.696
The Council hasn't a clue
what's happened here,

10:55.780 --> 10:59.659
and if they work out what we did
to the Dark Lord...

11:02.745 --> 11:05.122
...it'll be straight to the gallows
for all of us.

11:10.211 --> 11:11.379
Ms. Wardwell.

11:11.796 --> 11:13.506
What can I do for you, Sabrina?

11:13.589 --> 11:17.927
Actually, I wanted to check in on <i>you,</i>
on how <i>you're</i> doing.

11:18.761 --> 11:21.764
Well, I cannot account
for the last three months of my life,

11:21.847 --> 11:24.725
but clearly, I've been busy doing things,

11:25.559 --> 11:29.689
and the doctors can offer no medical
or logical explanation.

11:30.356 --> 11:34.068
And, uh, your sudden interest
in Dante's <i>Inferno?</i>

11:34.151 --> 11:37.863
Well, now that I can account for.

11:38.364 --> 11:42.660
I have been having nightmares, you see.

11:42.743 --> 11:44.662
Demons and hellscapes,

11:45.830 --> 11:49.625
and I've turned to inferno literature
as a source of...

11:50.418 --> 11:51.794
therapy, I suppose.

11:52.878 --> 11:56.215
They say he went there, you know, Dante.

11:56.298 --> 11:57.717
How could that be possible?

11:57.800 --> 12:01.679
Some of the world's greatest artists
have used Hell as their subject

12:01.762 --> 12:04.140
in such an authentic way
it feels as if they...

12:05.641 --> 12:07.768
they somehow must have visited the place.

12:08.394 --> 12:10.354
Hieronymus Bosch, for instance.

12:10.855 --> 12:16.777
His paintings have been described
as windows overlooking the hills of Hell.

12:20.197 --> 12:21.157
Windows?

12:23.701 --> 12:28.330
Ms. Wardwell, you're a genius,
and I'm so glad you're back.

12:33.294 --> 12:35.129
It is you, right?

12:35.212 --> 12:36.255
Who else would I be?

12:42.511 --> 12:43.637
Dorian?

12:44.180 --> 12:45.639
Dorian Gray.

12:45.723 --> 12:48.142
-I need your help.
-Don't look at me. I'm hideous!

12:48.225 --> 12:50.227
What? What happened?

12:50.311 --> 12:51.312
I have a...

12:52.855 --> 12:53.731
a pimple.

12:55.524 --> 12:57.651
I haven't had a pimple
since Basil painted my portrait.

12:57.735 --> 12:59.695
Actually, that's why I came to see you.

13:00.321 --> 13:01.947
You're an art collector, right?

13:03.282 --> 13:05.117
Do you have any paintings of Hell?

13:05.785 --> 13:07.536
Several. Doesn't everyone?

13:07.620 --> 13:10.623
Yes, but are any of them... a portal?

13:11.123 --> 13:14.585
You think you can just pop into Hell
for a quick visit and save darling Nicky?

13:14.668 --> 13:17.505
Well, doesn't quite work like that.

13:17.922 --> 13:21.550
Once you're in Hell, no one is
particularly inclined to let you leave.

13:22.134 --> 13:25.179
And, yes, I do have a...

13:26.722 --> 13:30.684
portal, which I will allow you to use
for a price.

13:32.228 --> 13:33.938
I want you to bring something back for me.

13:34.021 --> 13:35.731
Let me guess, your soul?

13:35.815 --> 13:36.732
No.

13:37.817 --> 13:39.360
I have no use for that.

13:42.154 --> 13:44.114
There is only one flower
that grows in Hell,

13:45.616 --> 13:47.034
in the Forest of Torment.

13:47.117 --> 13:48.786
La Fleur du Mal.

13:48.869 --> 13:52.498
It is the original flower of evil
that inspired the poet Baudelaire.

13:52.581 --> 13:54.542
Its nectar could help me with my...

13:56.293 --> 13:57.670
facial deformity.

13:58.462 --> 13:59.713
Bring it back for me,

14:00.339 --> 14:02.216
and I'll arrange safe passage for you.

14:02.299 --> 14:03.175
Done.

14:03.843 --> 14:06.595
Although it's not just gonna be
safe passage for me.

-Sabrina?
-You guys, I figured it out.

14:49.722 --> 14:52.349
It's time for Operation Hand Basket.

14:52.433 --> 14:54.768
-Hang on, you mean--
-We're going to Hell?

14:57.021 --> 14:59.189
-Like, Hell Hell?
-Yep. I found a back door.

14:59.273 --> 15:02.610
I gotta ask the question,
are humans even allowed in Hell?

15:02.693 --> 15:04.904
Well, technically, no,
but there are ways around that.

15:04.987 --> 15:06.488
Things we can do to prepare.

15:07.656 --> 15:09.491
If you're still willing to help.

15:13.412 --> 15:14.914
Let's rock 'n' roll.

15:19.126 --> 15:20.878
-Are your aunts home?
- No.

15:20.961 --> 15:23.589
They're staying at the Academy,
so timing's perfect.

15:28.802 --> 15:31.847
What is this stuff again?

15:31.931 --> 15:33.015
Ghastly water.

15:33.098 --> 15:35.059
Basically water you get
from wiping down corpses.

15:36.018 --> 15:36.852
Eww.

15:37.978 --> 15:39.271
And we're doing this why?

15:39.355 --> 15:40.981
It'll keep the demons from smelling us.

15:41.857 --> 15:43.484
We have to wear these shoes too.

15:44.818 --> 15:46.111
Dead people's shoes,

15:46.904 --> 15:49.114
for only the dead
may walk the paths of Hell.

15:51.659 --> 15:52.910
Okay.

15:56.330 --> 15:59.166
I'm sorry, Salem,
you're gonna have to sit this one out.

15:59.249 --> 16:01.961
If you came with us, you'd have
every hound of Hell from Barghest

16:02.044 --> 16:03.253
to Old Shuck chasing us down.

16:09.051 --> 16:10.511
Lights out, students.

16:12.304 --> 16:14.223
Time to say our prayers.

16:24.274 --> 16:26.568
Oh, Unholy Dark Lord,

16:28.737 --> 16:32.992
take my soul and do with it as thou wilt,

16:34.994 --> 16:37.329
as I will do with my flesh on Earth.

16:39.748 --> 16:40.958
Praise Satan.

16:41.041 --> 16:42.376
Praise Satan.

16:42.459 --> 16:44.336
<i>I find myself in a quandary, sister...</i>

16:44.962 --> 16:45.796
Hmm?

16:45.879 --> 16:49.299
Praying to the Dark Lord
who wished our enslavement,

16:49.383 --> 16:50.509
whom we unseated.

16:51.093 --> 16:53.429
-This lie unsettles me.
-Oh.

16:53.512 --> 16:54.680
I know.

16:55.347 --> 16:57.683
Why don't we tell the students
the truth then?

16:58.976 --> 17:00.769
I mean, why don't we pray to Lilith now?

17:02.980 --> 17:04.481
No, I can't do it.

17:05.482 --> 17:07.735
The students have already lost
their family, their friends.

17:07.818 --> 17:10.195
I can't very well take their god
from them too.

17:10.571 --> 17:12.781
Besides, we have more earthly concerns.

17:13.574 --> 17:14.950
What, the Council visit you mean?

17:15.784 --> 17:19.204
Yeah, don't worry about that, Zelds.
Got the perfect recipe for them.

17:19.538 --> 17:20.539
Just wait.

17:24.334 --> 17:26.295
Behold, the hellscape.

17:34.178 --> 17:38.557
Mind you,
the inferno is a lonely, desolate place.

17:39.725 --> 17:43.187
You might not see many monsters or demons,
but they're there.

17:44.772 --> 17:47.858
Find your way to the City of Pandemonium
as quickly as possible.

17:47.941 --> 17:49.068
And don't forget,

17:49.818 --> 17:53.113
the incantation I gave you
to transport you back...

17:54.323 --> 17:56.492
it won't work
unless you're holding my flower.

18:06.001 --> 18:07.252
I love you guys.

18:07.878 --> 18:10.172
Also, everybody stay close.

18:16.845 --> 18:20.057
Through me, pass into the unholy kingdom.

18:20.140 --> 18:23.018
Through me, pass into the city of fear.

18:23.102 --> 18:25.896
I am the gate for the lost and forsaken.

18:26.313 --> 18:29.399
Abandon all hope, ye who enter here.

18:49.086 --> 18:50.420
-Everyone okay?
-Yeah.

18:52.673 --> 18:54.758
Wait. So, Hell is a beach?

18:58.053 --> 18:59.471
The Shores of Sorrow.

19:02.266 --> 19:03.517
Guys, look.

19:03.600 --> 19:04.852
What are those?

19:10.107 --> 19:11.984
They're the souls of the damned.

19:15.654 --> 19:17.281
They drown as the tide rolls in,

19:19.616 --> 19:21.785
over and over...

19:23.078 --> 19:24.163
for all eternity.

19:24.830 --> 19:25.664
Hi.

19:26.290 --> 19:27.666
We're looking for Lilith.

19:28.250 --> 19:29.084
Uh...

19:29.459 --> 19:32.004
Madam Satan, Queen of Hell.

19:32.754 --> 19:35.424
She's in Pandemonium,
if you happen to know the way.

19:36.884 --> 19:38.594
All blood flows to Pandemonium.

19:42.306 --> 19:46.268
Follow the blood-red road where it flows,
and there you'll find the throne of Hell.

19:47.978 --> 19:48.979
Thanks.

19:51.523 --> 19:52.649
And you are?

19:54.651 --> 19:55.861
Never step off the road.

19:58.447 --> 20:01.074
It's clever you're wearing
dead men's shoes, though...

20:01.366 --> 20:04.411
any demon worth his salt
can smell mortal flesh a mile away.

20:10.125 --> 20:11.126
Come on.

20:12.044 --> 20:12.961
Let's go.

20:31.605 --> 20:34.066
So it's a friend's flat,

20:34.149 --> 20:36.652
but she lets me stay here
while I'm on holiday.

20:38.320 --> 20:39.655
It isn't much, but--

20:39.738 --> 20:42.074
No, no, this is fine, Ms. Dubois.

20:42.658 --> 20:44.284
More than fine.

20:44.368 --> 20:49.206
Now, I know it's early and we just met,
Mr. Wood, but fancy a drink?

20:49.289 --> 20:50.374
Please.

20:51.166 --> 20:52.292
What's your pleasure?

20:52.376 --> 20:53.293
Scotch...

20:56.421 --> 20:57.673
with ice.

20:58.215 --> 20:59.466
I'm sorry, Father.

21:00.217 --> 21:01.718
We're all out of ice.

21:06.431 --> 21:10.602
You have led us on quite the merry chase
around the world.

21:11.687 --> 21:13.355
You scoundrel.

21:13.438 --> 21:16.233
Where are they? Where have you hidden
my brother and sister?

21:16.316 --> 21:18.443
If you kill me, they'll never be found.

21:18.527 --> 21:19.486
Quite the contrary.

21:19.569 --> 21:23.490
We can easily extract that information
from your corpse using necromancy.

21:26.410 --> 21:30.289
My dearest Prudence,
please, you're my daughter.

21:30.914 --> 21:31.873
I love you.

21:34.042 --> 21:35.877
I forgive you this trespass.

21:38.755 --> 21:43.093
What a pitiful waste the two of you are.

21:44.428 --> 21:45.721
You'll never find him.

21:46.221 --> 21:48.682
He's your superior in all ways.

21:52.686 --> 21:54.021
Sweet Satan.

21:55.814 --> 21:58.608
One of Blackwood's Judas boys
wearing a glamour.

21:58.692 --> 22:02.279
Then he deserved death,
as my hated father does.

22:02.362 --> 22:05.782
We keep using the same tricks
against each other.

22:44.988 --> 22:47.699
Don't look. Nobody look. Just keep moving.

22:49.910 --> 22:51.036
Wait, is that...

22:52.704 --> 22:54.081
Uncle Jesse?

22:54.164 --> 22:56.333
-Uncle Jesse.
-No, don't!

22:56.416 --> 22:58.919
No, Theo, come back.
We can't stray off the road!

22:59.002 --> 23:00.212
Screw it.

23:09.805 --> 23:10.680
Uncle Jesse,

23:12.015 --> 23:14.101
how did...
how did you get here?

23:14.184 --> 23:15.477
You don't belong here.

23:15.560 --> 23:16.770
This isn't right.

23:17.396 --> 23:18.688
Susie?

23:19.439 --> 23:21.316
What happened to you, Uncle Jesse?

23:21.817 --> 23:24.319
-She sent me here.
- Who did?

23:24.861 --> 23:26.363
Lilith.

23:26.446 --> 23:27.823
-Lilith did?

23:28.240 --> 23:29.658
Madam Satan did?

23:30.075 --> 23:33.829
Sabrina, isn't there something you can do?
Some spell you can cast?

23:37.124 --> 23:43.338
<i>Qui affecto protego, mixtisque iubas</i>
<i>serpentibus et posteris meis stirpique.</i>

23:44.798 --> 23:45.757
There.

23:46.383 --> 23:48.385
No one will hurt him before we're back.

23:48.802 --> 23:50.429
Thank you.

23:51.179 --> 23:52.889
I'll stay behind, just to be sure.

23:52.973 --> 23:56.059
Theo, believe me, I know this is horrible,

23:57.352 --> 23:59.354
but our best chance
at getting your uncle out of here

23:59.438 --> 24:01.690
depends on us reaching Pandemonium,

24:01.773 --> 24:04.651
and the only way we'll get there
is if we stick together.

24:06.069 --> 24:09.448
I swear I will free him of this place.

24:11.741 --> 24:12.659
Okay?

24:22.794 --> 24:24.087
<i>What's this now?</i>

24:24.546 --> 24:29.092
Child of the Morningstar is here
in our realm?

24:29.176 --> 24:32.637
Yes, mistress,
following the blood-red road.

24:32.721 --> 24:33.722
Oh.

24:34.931 --> 24:36.349
I'm not surprised.

24:36.433 --> 24:38.059
It was only a matter of time.

24:38.602 --> 24:41.021
Suppose she's come for you, hasn't she?

24:41.104 --> 24:43.398
-What was that? Speak up.

24:43.482 --> 24:44.691
Cat got your tongue?

24:46.651 --> 24:47.986
Oh, no, that's right, I've got it.

24:49.571 --> 24:51.656
If she's following the blood-red road,

24:51.740 --> 24:54.367
she'll pass through
the Forest of Torment next.

24:55.911 --> 24:57.245
Tell me minion,

24:58.622 --> 24:59.998
is the woodsman well-oiled?

25:10.217 --> 25:11.635
How do I look, sister?

25:12.385 --> 25:14.930
Oh,
like a Daphne du Maurier novel.

25:17.849 --> 25:19.476
How do I look?

25:24.731 --> 25:28.527
You'll pass,
but careful you don't forget his voice.

25:30.737 --> 25:31.738
What's that cake?

25:35.534 --> 25:38.787
This is a yummy honey cake.
It's meant to influence the Council.

25:38.870 --> 25:43.792
See, we're feeding them a story
that everything's hunky-dory, right?

25:45.126 --> 25:47.254
Well, this moist treat
will sweeten up our tale

25:47.337 --> 25:49.923
so that the whole thing goes down
a bit easier.

25:51.216 --> 25:53.677
Let's hope your kitchen magick
is sufficient, sister.

25:53.760 --> 25:55.262
Oh.

25:59.808 --> 26:02.435
I'll never get that image
out of my brain.

26:03.270 --> 26:05.230
Those birds...

26:09.484 --> 26:12.279
Those birds were eating him, 'Brina.

26:13.363 --> 26:14.698
Eating him alive.

26:17.659 --> 26:20.203
'Brina, what did you say
that forest was called?

26:20.287 --> 26:21.997
The Forest of Torment.

26:22.080 --> 26:23.415
Okay, well...

26:28.795 --> 26:30.046
...I think we're in it.

26:35.093 --> 26:36.678
Listen to the trees.

26:40.181 --> 26:43.852
According to Dorian,
the flower of evil, there's only one,

26:43.935 --> 26:45.103
grows somewhere around here.

26:45.812 --> 26:48.106
I can't believe
I'm suggesting this.

26:49.149 --> 26:51.484
But what if Sabrina and I look
on this side of the forest,

26:51.568 --> 26:53.612
and Harvey and Theo look on that side?

26:53.695 --> 26:56.740
And, guys,
don't make any loud noises, okay?

26:56.823 --> 26:58.575
I have a feeling
the ghastly water's worn off

26:58.658 --> 27:01.995
and not gonna do much to keep us hidden
from demons at this point.

27:12.422 --> 27:13.798
Roz, do you hear that?

27:15.008 --> 27:16.343
It's like singing.

27:31.858 --> 27:34.152
Harvey, did you hear that?

27:35.737 --> 27:36.738
Hear what?

27:41.660 --> 27:42.994
Sounds like chopping.

27:44.162 --> 27:45.038
Harvey?

27:48.625 --> 27:49.959
Stay frosty, Theo.

27:58.259 --> 27:59.219
That's it.

27:59.969 --> 28:01.304
The flower of evil.

28:01.388 --> 28:02.472
It has to be.

28:08.978 --> 28:11.356
Is the flower really singing?

28:15.026 --> 28:17.362
It's like something out of a fairy tale.

28:19.155 --> 28:20.573
Roz, wait.

28:21.241 --> 28:23.660
We have to be careful
the thorns don't prick us.

28:24.202 --> 28:25.995
Why, what happens if they prick us?

28:26.079 --> 28:29.207
If they break our skin,
we go to sleep and never wake up.

28:29.290 --> 28:30.208
Oh.

28:49.769 --> 28:51.271
Holy shit.

28:54.357 --> 28:55.692
-Theo, go!
-What about you?

28:55.775 --> 28:58.403
Just go! Get to Sabrina!
We need her magick!

29:10.790 --> 29:11.750
Theo?

29:11.833 --> 29:13.668
There's a crazy tin man
trying to kill Harvey.

29:13.752 --> 29:14.627
-Huh?
-What?

29:29.017 --> 29:30.143
Hey!

29:30.226 --> 29:34.105
Salt of earth and salt of ocean,
I call on you to stop his motion.

29:34.189 --> 29:36.566
Iron seize and joints grasp,
mortis in a rusting grasp.

29:43.865 --> 29:44.908
Harv?

29:47.744 --> 29:48.661
Harvey?

29:49.329 --> 29:50.205
Tommy?

29:51.831 --> 29:53.124
Why did you kill me?

29:53.208 --> 29:55.043
I... I had to, Tommy.

29:56.252 --> 30:00.632
-What are you doing here?
-I'm waiting for you to join me.

30:08.306 --> 30:09.557
I'm sorry, Harvey,

30:11.017 --> 30:12.477
but that wasn't your brother.

30:17.732 --> 30:19.234
Come on. Come on.

30:20.026 --> 30:21.236
It's okay.

30:23.446 --> 30:24.614
It's okay.

30:26.074 --> 30:27.575
<i>What's that, you say?</i>

30:28.409 --> 30:30.245
They escaped the woodsman, did they?

30:31.162 --> 30:32.872
Yes, mistress.

30:32.956 --> 30:37.836
Well, then, it's time
someone teaches these brats a lesson.

30:38.461 --> 30:39.420
Yes.

30:40.630 --> 30:43.299
A couple of old friends
should do the trick.

30:46.761 --> 30:49.222
These last few weeks,
no matter how close we come to him,

30:49.305 --> 30:51.599
my father always manages to elude us.

30:58.231 --> 31:01.150
As insane as your father is,
he is a master of the mystic arts,

31:01.234 --> 31:03.111
and we were merely his students.

31:04.320 --> 31:06.281
Everything we know about witchcraft,

31:06.364 --> 31:07.407
he taught us.

31:07.490 --> 31:11.703
Therefore, it reasons we can never surpass
nor catch up to him.

31:14.747 --> 31:17.667
What if we used
another type of witchcraft?

31:19.627 --> 31:21.296
One he didn't teach us.

31:21.838 --> 31:23.006
How do you mean?

31:46.863 --> 31:49.866
This place is a laugh.

31:51.659 --> 31:53.411
Are you sure you want to do this?

31:55.830 --> 31:56.956
Excuse me?

31:57.999 --> 31:59.375
We'd like to do a reading.

31:59.459 --> 32:02.962
Do you want tarot,
tea leaves, or chicken feet?

32:04.380 --> 32:06.674
No, that's for tourists. Um...

32:08.843 --> 32:12.847
We want the real New Orleans
hoodoo vodou magic.

32:21.189 --> 32:22.482
Delighted.

32:23.191 --> 32:26.486
I am Mambo
Michele Marie Le Fleur...

32:26.569 --> 32:28.404
Priestess of High Haiti,

32:28.905 --> 32:30.490
daughter of the Tiano people,

32:30.573 --> 32:32.742
faithful to Guinee...

32:33.993 --> 32:39.165
and I don't do none of this watered-down
New Orleans vodou hoodoo bullshit.

32:41.417 --> 32:46.255
This is a Haitian house...

32:46.339 --> 32:47.715
Do you understand?

32:47.799 --> 32:48.716
Yes, yes.

32:48.800 --> 32:50.051
Uh-huh.

32:50.510 --> 32:53.096
And the vodou practice in this house...

32:53.179 --> 32:54.555
dear...

32:54.639 --> 32:57.058
is a way of life.

33:00.770 --> 33:02.772
You are witches.

33:03.940 --> 33:05.483
New England witches, hey?

33:07.777 --> 33:09.737
What is it you seek?

33:09.821 --> 33:12.073
Not a what, a who.

33:12.156 --> 33:13.074
Hmm.

33:13.157 --> 33:17.495
A man, betrayer, a murderer.

33:18.121 --> 33:20.248
Someone who could be
anywhere in the world,

33:20.331 --> 33:22.041
if not another dimension.

33:26.212 --> 33:28.548
You will need a world map...

33:29.882 --> 33:32.093
and something of this man...

33:32.176 --> 33:34.512
hair, clothes, a photo.

33:34.595 --> 33:35.513
His blood?

33:37.390 --> 33:39.809
Well, I do have his blood inside me.

33:41.394 --> 33:43.271
That will do.

33:52.780 --> 33:55.408
It was Tommy's voice,
exactly, Roz,

33:56.159 --> 33:58.036
and his face.

33:59.037 --> 34:00.455
I know, babe.

34:01.205 --> 34:06.335
But I'm with Sabrina.
That wasn't your brother, okay.

34:06.419 --> 34:08.129
It's this place.

34:08.212 --> 34:10.298
-It messes with you.
-I shouldn't have come here.

34:10.381 --> 34:11.340
Um...

34:11.632 --> 34:12.717
guys?

34:18.347 --> 34:21.809
We are never going to get to Pandemonium.

34:56.803 --> 34:57.762
We should go.

34:57.845 --> 34:59.680
Right the heaven now.

34:59.764 --> 35:00.681
Go?

35:03.267 --> 35:07.271
No, I'm afraid not, Miss Spellman.

35:07.355 --> 35:09.023
Principal Hawthorne?

35:09.107 --> 35:11.651
Silent, class, and take your seats,

35:11.734 --> 35:15.613
because school is in...

35:16.656 --> 35:18.032
session!

35:27.542 --> 35:28.584
'Brina?

35:30.628 --> 35:34.966
Here I sit, a humble beseecher,
rid us of this infernal teacher!

35:35.508 --> 35:38.553
Oh, Miss Spellman.

35:40.847 --> 35:42.098
No.

35:46.435 --> 35:49.438
There will be no spell casting either.

35:49.522 --> 35:54.610
Now, today,
we have a special surprise guest.

35:55.236 --> 35:57.697
One of you may know her as--

35:57.780 --> 35:58.698
Grandma?

35:58.781 --> 36:02.743
Child, you were the death of me,

36:04.328 --> 36:08.040
and now I'm gonna be the death of you.

36:08.124 --> 36:10.001
What? Why?

36:10.084 --> 36:15.631
Because your daddy is a preacher
and you're in Hell, that's why.

36:15.715 --> 36:18.801
You have the gift of the cunning,

36:18.885 --> 36:22.054
and you wasted it helping witches.

36:23.055 --> 36:24.056
You know what?

36:24.515 --> 36:31.397
I was going to ask for a volunteer to help
with today's little anatomy lesson,

36:31.939 --> 36:38.279
but now I believe we'll start
with Miss Walker.

36:44.577 --> 36:46.871
Your Majestic Malevolence,

36:46.954 --> 36:49.373
I'm afraid the Three Kings of Hell
have returned.

36:50.583 --> 36:51.959
Tell the kings

36:52.627 --> 36:57.006
we will not have our sovereignty
challenged by them again.

36:57.089 --> 36:58.925
I understand, Your Viciousness,

36:59.008 --> 37:01.135
but they brought the hordes of Hell
with them this time.

37:02.553 --> 37:08.434
So we must suffer the indignity
of these would-be usurpers

37:08.517 --> 37:10.978
questioning our right to the throne,

37:11.062 --> 37:14.732
while Sabrina Morningstar
invades our kingdom,

37:14.815 --> 37:18.110
no doubt to claim our favorite pet.

37:20.738 --> 37:23.491
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

37:23.574 --> 37:25.993
But of course.

37:27.828 --> 37:32.124
Tell the kings we will receive them
before the day is out,

37:32.875 --> 37:36.921
but first bring me Sabrina,
safe and alive, please.

37:37.004 --> 37:38.506
And her traveling companions?

37:38.589 --> 37:41.092
Well, if they're alive,
she will have more to lose,

37:41.175 --> 37:43.886
but in truth,
we are indifferent to their fate.

37:52.436 --> 37:56.148
Perhaps I can kill two Stymphalian birds
with one stone.

37:57.233 --> 37:59.819
It's honey cake. Homemade.

38:00.569 --> 38:05.658
You may deliver unto me a large slice,
Lady Blackwood.

38:07.576 --> 38:13.165
Fathers, Council members,
please do forgive me.

38:17.003 --> 38:18.963
Um... where were we?

38:19.046 --> 38:22.300
We were discussing
your conspicuous absence

38:22.383 --> 38:24.677
from last month's intercoven meeting.

38:25.094 --> 38:27.013
The Council meeting.

38:27.179 --> 38:28.014
Uh...

38:28.681 --> 38:30.349
Yeah, yes, I remember now.

38:30.433 --> 38:33.019
I had a dodgy curry the night before.

38:35.187 --> 38:37.773
Constitution's not what it used to be,
I'm afraid.

38:44.322 --> 38:46.073
Well, darling of you to stop by.

38:46.615 --> 38:49.493
There is one other point of order,
Faustus.

38:51.871 --> 38:55.708
Some of the members
of the wider Council, not us,

38:55.791 --> 38:57.585
not anyone here,

38:58.252 --> 39:03.507
have reported
an ever so slight loss of potency.

39:04.300 --> 39:07.762
Virility. Power, one might say.

39:07.845 --> 39:13.434
Faustus, have you, too,
experienced such symptoms?

39:14.060 --> 39:15.061
Um...

39:21.067 --> 39:23.527
I can't say that I have.

39:24.111 --> 39:25.404
Though if I might suggest,

39:25.488 --> 39:29.158
perhaps you should pray
to the Dark Lord for guidance.

39:30.201 --> 39:31.160
Have you...

39:31.869 --> 39:34.330
prayed recently?

39:36.207 --> 39:40.795
We are in constant commune
with our Dark Lord.

39:40.878 --> 39:43.839
I myself spoke with him directly
just this very morning.

39:45.383 --> 39:48.552
And, um, did the Dark Lord answer?

39:49.220 --> 39:50.096
Of course he did.

39:53.099 --> 39:54.392
<i>And did you hear them,</i>

39:54.475 --> 39:57.311
their bald-faced lies
about communing with the Dark Lord?

39:57.395 --> 39:59.730
What poppycock. Every single one of them.

39:59.814 --> 40:02.858
Hypocrites and charlatans,
blatant mendacity.

40:05.277 --> 40:07.822
If I'm to rebuild this coven
from the ground up,

40:09.240 --> 40:11.283
then we must tell our flock the truth.

40:11.867 --> 40:13.994
So... what, even about the Dark Lord?

40:14.078 --> 40:16.038
Well, some version of the truth, at least.

40:17.039 --> 40:18.082
Oh, no.

40:23.796 --> 40:26.006
Please. Please. Please.

40:26.549 --> 40:28.509
Nana Ruth, please don't do this!

40:28.592 --> 40:30.761
Principal Hawthorne,
if you hurt her, I swear to God...

40:30.845 --> 40:31.804
God?

40:34.432 --> 40:37.560
You are in high school in Hell.

40:38.102 --> 40:39.562
There is no God here.

40:39.645 --> 40:42.356
Let's just do him next.

40:43.065 --> 40:43.983
No!

40:45.693 --> 40:46.902
Please!

40:46.986 --> 40:49.363
Excuse me, Your Flatulences.

40:50.156 --> 40:54.201
The Queen requests the pleasure
of the children's company.

40:55.453 --> 40:58.581
But she...
she sent for us to torture them.

40:58.664 --> 41:01.041
It is our Queen's prerogative
to change her mind.

41:07.339 --> 41:09.842
Shall we, children?

41:09.925 --> 41:13.304
Tonight, children, we will be saying
our evening prayers to...

41:14.638 --> 41:15.639
someone different.

41:19.059 --> 41:21.979
Hail Lilith, full of disgrace,

41:22.813 --> 41:24.732
cursed are you amongst women.

41:25.483 --> 41:27.860
And cursed is the fruit of thy womb.

41:28.694 --> 41:32.323
Demons, you fled the garden,

41:32.406 --> 41:35.659
<i>where the weak ones dwelled</i>
<i>and did not live in shame.</i>

41:36.869 --> 41:40.122
Unholy Lilith, mother of night,

41:41.040 --> 41:46.921
pray for us sinners now
and at the witching hour of our death.

41:48.005 --> 41:49.423
Praise Madam Satan.

41:58.724 --> 42:00.059
Praise Madam Satan.

42:04.021 --> 42:05.564
Praise Madam Satan.

42:08.317 --> 42:10.319
<i>Praise Madam Satan!</i>

42:11.195 --> 42:12.363
Did you hear that?

42:14.573 --> 42:15.699
They're praying...

42:17.868 --> 42:18.953
to me.

42:23.999 --> 42:27.670
Queen Lilith, your visitors have arrived.

42:32.174 --> 42:33.676
Sabrina,

42:35.135 --> 42:38.639
how wonderful, you come to visit.

42:39.431 --> 42:41.350
You brought your little chums.

42:42.142 --> 42:43.769
You know why I'm here.

42:43.852 --> 42:46.313
Oh, you mean young Nicholas Scratch?

42:46.397 --> 42:49.108
-Mm-hmm.
-Yeah, he's... he's right over there.

42:49.191 --> 42:50.651
-Nick!
-Uh-uh!

42:51.235 --> 42:52.319
No, no.

42:52.403 --> 42:55.823
There's plenty of time
for tearful reunions after dinner.

42:55.906 --> 42:59.243
There are certain protocols
that must be followed,

42:59.827 --> 43:00.953
even in Hell.

43:01.870 --> 43:04.290
What's happening?
What's happening to him...

43:05.416 --> 43:07.084
-on the inside?
-Of himself?

43:07.960 --> 43:09.795
Well, I'm sure he and the Dark Lord

43:09.878 --> 43:13.090
are having all sorts
of fascinating conversations

43:13.173 --> 43:17.553
within that handsome
little slab of a flesh Acheron.

43:19.555 --> 43:22.933
Now come along, the lot of you.

43:31.442 --> 43:32.276
Yield!

43:32.359 --> 43:33.652
Yield, curse you!

43:33.736 --> 43:35.988
Never! You'll never escape.

43:42.202 --> 43:43.787
Please, sit, eat.

43:44.371 --> 43:45.914
Refresh yourselves.

43:49.084 --> 43:50.252
Don't eat that turkey leg.

43:52.212 --> 43:53.505
-How come?
-Trust me.

43:55.341 --> 43:56.300
It's not edible.

43:58.302 --> 43:59.720
None of the food is edible.

44:03.515 --> 44:04.642
I have a question.

44:06.101 --> 44:07.936
Why do you still look like Ms. Wardwell?

44:08.020 --> 44:10.272
Well, I grew comfortable wearing her skin,

44:11.065 --> 44:13.942
and a face like this, it's hard to beat.

44:15.778 --> 44:17.237
Do you wanna see my real one?

44:17.613 --> 44:20.324
I mean, my... green one?

44:21.492 --> 44:24.036
No. No, what I want is Nick outta here.

44:25.079 --> 44:27.831
-And Jesse Putnam's soul.
-And Jesse Putnam too.

44:27.915 --> 44:30.793
And I'm not even gonna ask
if you're responsible for him being here,

44:30.876 --> 44:32.002
because who else would it be?

44:33.128 --> 44:35.464
I'll look into this for you.
Jesse Putnam, is it?

44:37.466 --> 44:39.385
But, my dear, aren't you forgetting...

44:40.260 --> 44:42.971
Nicholas Scratch has the Devil inside him?

44:43.389 --> 44:45.057
I'll find a different prison
for my father.

44:49.103 --> 44:49.937
All right.

44:51.063 --> 44:52.189
You can have him.

44:53.482 --> 44:54.942
On one condition.

44:56.276 --> 44:57.361
Which is?

44:59.863 --> 45:04.118
The hierarchy of Hell has been
in the tiniest state of turmoil.

45:04.201 --> 45:08.247
Lately, the Infernal Kings
refuse to recognize my authority

45:08.330 --> 45:10.040
because I'm not a Morningstar.

45:10.124 --> 45:13.669
But it would calm the dark waters
if you simply...

45:15.462 --> 45:17.172
crowned me Queen of Hell.

45:17.256 --> 45:19.299
I already did that. You're wearing it.

45:19.383 --> 45:22.219
Yeah, well, I need you to do it again.
Here.

45:22.302 --> 45:26.098
Publicly, to make me legitimate
in their eyes.

45:28.183 --> 45:30.936
-And then I get Nick back?
-Absolutely.

45:36.900 --> 45:37.860
Fine.

45:38.485 --> 45:39.403
I'll do it.

45:39.486 --> 45:40.779
But no tricks.

45:42.614 --> 45:43.449
Excellent.

45:44.658 --> 45:46.034
Now, who has room for dessert?

46:05.471 --> 46:08.307
Oh, don't get distracted now.

46:08.390 --> 46:09.933
We still have work to do.

46:10.017 --> 46:12.519
A bit of sex magic to enhance the mood?

46:14.938 --> 46:19.234
This? This isn't sex magic.
It's blood magic, remember?

46:20.444 --> 46:21.653
I have Mambo Marie's knife.

47:03.487 --> 47:04.822
Scotland?

47:04.905 --> 47:06.824
Loch Ness, to be exact.

47:08.575 --> 47:10.828
Then that's where we're going
to kill my father.

47:33.267 --> 47:36.103
Infernal Court, I bid you welcome.

47:36.186 --> 47:37.771
Hail the kings.

47:37.855 --> 47:40.607
The City of Pandemonium
has an honored guest.

47:40.691 --> 47:44.820
May I present to the hordes,
Sabrina Morningstar,

47:45.779 --> 47:48.115
daughter of Lucifer Morningstar.

47:48.824 --> 47:54.746
In his absence, she has come
to officially declare me Queen of Hell.

47:54.830 --> 47:57.332
- What? No.
-Isn't that right, Sabrina?

47:57.416 --> 47:59.626
Yes, that's right.

47:59.710 --> 48:01.378
This is treason! Heresy.

48:01.461 --> 48:04.089
Lilith is a concubine, not a queen.

48:04.172 --> 48:05.966
We do not recognize her.

48:06.049 --> 48:07.843
She was Lucifer's whore.

48:07.926 --> 48:13.098
The realms are in chaos, and the Earth,
the pit, the heavens, the cosmos,

48:13.181 --> 48:16.685
they all reject Lilith's claim
to the throne.

48:16.768 --> 48:18.770
And who do you propose would rule?

48:19.646 --> 48:20.647
Ahh.

48:20.856 --> 48:26.820
All hail Caliban, Prince of Hell.

48:26.904 --> 48:30.365
-Molded from the clay of the pit itself.

48:30.449 --> 48:33.452
Native son of the inferno,

48:33.535 --> 48:37.581
born to restore and rule our dark domain.

48:37.664 --> 48:38.582
Hello again.

48:39.082 --> 48:39.917
Uh...

48:40.500 --> 48:41.585
Hi?

48:41.668 --> 48:42.628
What is this?

48:42.711 --> 48:44.588
This is salvation.

48:45.339 --> 48:46.965
Since the Dark Lord's desertion,

48:47.049 --> 48:49.134
the Nine Circles of Hell
have been breaking down.

48:49.676 --> 48:56.391
I, Caliban, will restore stability
and do what Lucifer failed to do...

48:56.975 --> 48:58.268
conquer the Earth.

48:59.853 --> 49:01.271
Remake it as our tenth circle

49:02.689 --> 49:04.608
and enslave the tribes
of mortal and witch.

49:05.233 --> 49:06.318
Tenth?

49:06.401 --> 49:08.028
Isn't nine circles enough?

49:08.820 --> 49:12.240
This is a coup d'état.
We'll lose everything.

49:17.955 --> 49:19.748
<i>Come to me, Sabrina.</i>

49:23.627 --> 49:24.670
Lucifer.

49:25.170 --> 49:26.004
Ah.

49:26.088 --> 49:27.881
My darling daughter.

49:28.840 --> 49:30.467
What a disappointment you are.

49:30.550 --> 49:32.636
Back at you.<i> </i>Where's Nick?

49:32.719 --> 49:34.054
You betrayed me.

49:34.680 --> 49:38.308
For that, your suffering
shall be legendary, even for Hell.

49:38.850 --> 49:42.104
-But you have a crown to claim.
-I don't want it.<i> </i>I never wanted it.

49:42.688 --> 49:45.273
All I want right now is my boyfriend back.

49:45.357 --> 49:46.775
Have you no pride, girl?

49:46.858 --> 49:50.612
This so-called Prince Caliban
is made of dirt.

49:50.696 --> 49:52.823
You have royal blood in your veins.

49:52.906 --> 49:55.659
Only you can restore the balance in Hell.

49:55.742 --> 49:57.119
I don't care about Hell.

49:57.202 --> 49:58.370
But you should.

49:58.453 --> 50:01.123
When the balance is off in Hell,
so it is off in Heaven,

50:01.206 --> 50:03.166
so it is off on Earth.

50:03.500 --> 50:06.294
It's basic cosmology:
to preserve one realm,

50:06.378 --> 50:08.463
you must preserve them all.

50:09.006 --> 50:12.718
And already the chaos
your failed abdication has provoked

50:12.801 --> 50:14.761
threatens your precious Greendale.

50:14.845 --> 50:17.806
What are you talking about? What threats?

50:17.889 --> 50:19.891
The old ones are coming.

50:20.976 --> 50:23.395
Should be rolling in any minute now.

50:23.478 --> 50:25.439
You're lying, again.

50:25.522 --> 50:27.607
I do lie, and often, but not about this.

50:27.691 --> 50:32.112
Nor am I lying when I tell you
that only a true queen has the authority,

50:32.195 --> 50:35.407
the power, to liberate Nicholas Scratch
from this realm.

50:35.490 --> 50:37.284
And the kings will never declare
Lilith queen,

50:37.367 --> 50:39.244
no matter what you say or do.

50:39.327 --> 50:40.954
So if you want him back--

50:41.038 --> 50:42.122
Don't do it, Sabrina.

50:42.706 --> 50:44.082
Nick. Oh, Nick.

50:49.755 --> 50:52.132
Don't do it. It's what he wants.

50:52.758 --> 50:54.551
-Nick.
-Forget this place.

50:54.634 --> 50:55.469
Forget about me.

50:55.552 --> 50:57.763
If my being queen is the only way
to get you out of Hell--

50:57.846 --> 50:59.598
-I don't matter.
-I miss you.

51:01.308 --> 51:05.395
I miss you so much,
every second of every day.

51:06.104 --> 51:07.189
Sabrina...

51:08.732 --> 51:11.443
you're the reason
I'm still sane and alive,

51:12.152 --> 51:13.820
but you have to forget me.

51:14.988 --> 51:16.531
-You have to move on.
-I won't.

51:17.324 --> 51:18.533
I can't.

51:19.576 --> 51:21.036
I love you, Nick.

51:21.870 --> 51:23.371
I love you too, Sabrina.

51:24.581 --> 51:27.667
All right, that's enough.
You know what must be done, Sabrina.

51:28.418 --> 51:31.880
Claim the throne, embrace your destiny,

51:33.131 --> 51:37.302
and save your boyfriend,
or say goodbye to him forever.

51:40.430 --> 51:41.848
This is a coup d'état.

51:42.641 --> 51:44.184
We'll lose everything.

51:48.438 --> 51:50.774
No, we won't.

51:54.361 --> 51:56.279
I am Sabrina Morningstar,

51:56.363 --> 52:00.367
and that throne is mine
by blood and by birth.

52:00.450 --> 52:01.493
Here we go again.

52:01.910 --> 52:03.328
Yours to give me, you mean.

52:04.037 --> 52:04.913
No...

52:06.832 --> 52:07.791
mine...

52:09.292 --> 52:10.168
to claim.

52:11.753 --> 52:13.505
We do not accept this.

52:13.588 --> 52:17.342
The witch lives on Earth.
She cannot possibly rule Hell.

52:17.425 --> 52:19.427
You've obviously never been
to high school.

52:19.511 --> 52:23.390
You are a child, not a queen.

52:23.473 --> 52:24.808
I am a young woman.

52:24.891 --> 52:28.103
You cannot fulfill your father's duties.

52:29.062 --> 52:29.896
I can.

52:31.314 --> 52:34.109
-With Lilith as my advisor.
-What?

52:34.192 --> 52:37.404
Isn't that what kings and queens do
when they're too young to rule?

52:38.613 --> 52:40.407
They appoint a--

52:41.283 --> 52:42.117
Regent.

52:44.452 --> 52:46.329
Yes, as a matter of fact, yes.

52:46.413 --> 52:48.582
Then you, Lilith, are my regent.

52:48.665 --> 52:50.250
I dispute this.

52:54.754 --> 52:56.715
Dispute this on what grounds?

52:56.798 --> 52:58.592
Monarchs rule by divine rights.

52:59.050 --> 53:03.305
The daughter of the Morningstar
is half-mortal, not divine at all.

53:03.805 --> 53:05.807
If she wants the crown,

53:05.891 --> 53:07.767
she's going to have to
prove herself worthy.

53:08.310 --> 53:11.938
Infernal law states any king or queen
may be challenged by their courts.

53:12.022 --> 53:13.565
I, Caliban, Prince of Hell--

53:13.648 --> 53:16.985
A king or queen may be challenged,
it's true,

53:17.485 --> 53:21.865
but a certain number of signatures
are to be required.

53:21.948 --> 53:25.118
In other words, back the heaven off...

53:27.329 --> 53:30.165
unless you want even more instability
in the realm?

53:32.292 --> 53:33.919
The infernal crown will crush you.

53:34.002 --> 53:35.086
Maybe.

53:36.463 --> 53:37.631
Maybe not.

53:40.050 --> 53:43.094
In the meantime,
as queen, here's my first decree.

53:43.595 --> 53:45.639
This Infernal Court is dismissed.

53:47.849 --> 53:48.892
You can all leave now.

53:51.937 --> 53:54.522
- Go!
-So sayeth the Queen.

54:05.784 --> 54:07.369
That was awesome.

54:08.453 --> 54:09.287
Indeed.

54:11.206 --> 54:12.749
But let me give you a tip.

54:12.832 --> 54:17.629
A real queen refers to herself
with the <i>pluralis majestatis,</i>

54:18.672 --> 54:19.631
the royal we.

54:21.049 --> 54:24.928
In that case, <i>we</i> are ready
to bring Nick back to Greendale now.

54:26.137 --> 54:29.266
-Sabrina?
<i>-</i>And Jesse Putnam, don't forget.

54:30.183 --> 54:31.017
There.

54:31.851 --> 54:35.647
His soul is free,
already rushing towards the heavens.

54:35.730 --> 54:37.357
You'll have to teach me how to do that.

54:37.440 --> 54:39.693
And a great many other things
if you're to survive.

54:39.776 --> 54:42.404
This gambit of yours
has bought you some time,

54:42.487 --> 54:45.824
but we both know you don't really want
your father's throne.

54:46.324 --> 54:50.495
And neither the kings nor their golden boy
desire you to have it.

54:51.621 --> 54:53.540
They will challenge you for it.

54:53.623 --> 54:55.750
And I'll decide whether or not
I wanna defend it.

54:56.626 --> 54:57.627
But not right now.

54:57.711 --> 54:59.671
Right now, all I want is to go home.

55:00.297 --> 55:03.174
Can I do that with my friends
and with Nick?

55:04.634 --> 55:05.635
And his tongue.

55:06.386 --> 55:07.679
You're queen.

55:07.762 --> 55:09.597
You can do whatever you want.

55:10.598 --> 55:12.600
Assuming you have a way to get home.

55:12.684 --> 55:13.560
I do.

55:14.144 --> 55:16.980
I have a flower and the magic words.

55:17.397 --> 55:20.150
<i>Ibi locum non sicut domum.</i>

55:20.775 --> 55:23.486
<i>Ibi locum non sicut domum.</i>

55:23.945 --> 55:26.698
<i>Ibi locum non sicut domum.</i>

55:26.781 --> 55:29.409
<i>Ibi locum non sicut domum.</i>

55:29.951 --> 55:32.329
<i>Ibi locum non sicut domum.</i>

55:32.746 --> 55:34.998
<i>Ibi locum non sicut domum.</i>

55:35.081 --> 55:37.375
<i>Ibi locum non sicut domum.</i>

55:42.005 --> 55:43.173
Welcome back.

55:43.757 --> 55:45.550
Now where the devil is my flower?

55:47.886 --> 55:50.347
It got a little crumpled.

55:56.853 --> 55:59.272
You don't think anyone
will find him down here?

55:59.481 --> 56:03.610
My aunties may have re-opened the Academy,
but they'd never re-open the dungeons.

56:04.277 --> 56:05.695
What if he escapes?

56:06.071 --> 56:09.908
His chains are forged from Damascus steel,
and he's in a circle of salt,

56:10.867 --> 56:13.661
and I'll keep calming candles burning
'round the clock.

56:38.812 --> 56:40.563
So what happens next?

56:41.856 --> 56:44.526
We get my father out of Nick
and into some other body.

56:44.609 --> 56:48.321
No, I meant with you,
now that you're, you know...

56:50.615 --> 56:51.699
the Queen of Hell.

56:51.783 --> 56:55.578
Well, that was to bring Nick back.

56:55.662 --> 56:59.082
I mean, I'm obviously not moving to Hell.

56:59.165 --> 57:01.751
'Brina, the fact that you just said that
makes me think...

57:01.835 --> 57:03.795
- you're moving to Hell.
-I'm not.

57:04.587 --> 57:05.964
I'm not moving to Hell.

57:06.047 --> 57:08.633
I mean, I may have to play the part
for a little while, but...

57:09.134 --> 57:10.802
my heart's not hellbound.

57:10.885 --> 57:11.845
It's with you guys,

57:12.512 --> 57:14.222
and Nick, and the Academy,

57:14.305 --> 57:15.432
and Baxter High.

57:16.182 --> 57:21.146
In fact, if you're still signing up
for cheerleading, Roz, count me in.

57:21.938 --> 57:23.982
-Seriously?
-Most definitely.

57:24.732 --> 57:26.818
Even though I'm totally not
the Queen of Hell,

57:27.318 --> 57:30.613
a friend once told me
it can't be all hell, all the time.

57:32.073 --> 57:33.324
To Sabrina Spellman.

57:33.408 --> 57:34.659
Cheerleader by day,

57:35.118 --> 57:36.453
Queen of Hell by night.

57:44.252 --> 57:45.336
Guys, what was that?

57:47.088 --> 57:49.090
Nothing. Just the wind.

58:00.185 --> 58:02.103
<i>The old ones are coming.</i>

58:03.229 --> 58:05.523
<i>Should be rolling in any minute now.</i>

59:21.266 --> 59:23.268
Greg, move your head!
