I love my new lasso!
Wanna play cowboy, Ollie?

00:38.000 --> 00:41.080
- [Moon] I have another hat!
- Whoa!

00:41.199 --> 00:42.559
Sure, Moon.
In just a minute.

00:42.680 --> 00:45.280
I'm kind of busy
with my maps now.

00:45.400 --> 00:48.080
Ooh! These are neat!
Why haven't I seen them before?

00:48.199 --> 00:50.879
'Cause I usually keep
these maps in my drawer.

00:52.879 --> 00:55.279
- Yeehaw!
- They're way too special

00:55.400 --> 00:56.480
to take on a trip.

00:56.599 --> 00:57.879
They might get wrecked.

00:58.000 --> 00:59.599
Auntie Char gave me this one.

00:59.720 --> 01:01.640
A map of the Grand Canyon

01:01.760 --> 01:04.280
that you can only get
at the Grand Canyon!

01:04.399 --> 01:06.119
That is special!

01:06.240 --> 01:07.840
Are you hungry for a snack?

01:07.960 --> 01:10.880
Betcha I can lasso
something from the kitchen!

01:13.119 --> 01:15.240
- Yeehaw!
- Gah!

01:15.360 --> 01:17.039
[nervous laugh] Oops!

01:17.160 --> 01:20.840
Tell you what. You play lasso.
I'll get snacks.

01:24.240 --> 01:25.880
Sorry, partner,

01:26.000 --> 01:28.560
but this garden ain't big enough
for the both of us!

01:30.880 --> 01:32.200
Yeehaw!

01:32.320 --> 01:35.080
[gasps]
Oh, no! I wrecked Ollie's map!

01:35.199 --> 01:36.399
What am I gonna do?

01:37.839 --> 01:39.399
[blowing]

01:39.520 --> 01:43.160
- Are cheese and crackers OK?
- Uh-huh! Great!

01:43.280 --> 01:44.360
[blowing]

01:44.479 --> 01:46.080
Here we go!

01:46.199 --> 01:49.199
You know what? I just had
an amazing brainstorm!

01:49.320 --> 01:51.000
Let's go to the Grand Canyon

01:51.119 --> 01:53.399
and play with my lasso
in the real West!

01:53.520 --> 01:55.280
But I'm still playing
with my maps.

01:55.399 --> 02:00.000
Please, Ollie! You know how
it is when you get a new toy.

02:00.119 --> 02:02.399
You just don't want
to stop playing with it.

02:02.520 --> 02:04.919
I get it, Moon. I'll go.

02:05.039 --> 02:08.160
Now, should I take my precious
Grand Canyon map with us?

02:10.000 --> 02:13.760
Nah. If something
ever happened to it... Hoo!

02:13.880 --> 02:18.000
- I can't even think about that.
- Great! Now giddy up!

02:18.120 --> 02:19.799
I'll clean this up
while you pack.

02:19.920 --> 02:24.400
We're going to the Grand Canyon,
cowboy! Yeehaw!

02:31.799 --> 02:33.040
Whoo!

02:33.880 --> 02:35.440
Whee!

02:42.959 --> 02:46.760
[narrator]<i> Now approaching</i>
<i>the Grand Canyon, USA!</i>

02:46.880 --> 02:48.440
<i>Yay!</i>

02:54.120 --> 02:57.959
Whoa! What a canyon!

02:58.320 --> 03:02.480
Wow! What a gift shop!
And there's the map I need.

03:02.600 --> 03:04.000
Come on, buckaroo!

03:04.120 --> 03:07.320
Let's ride over
and check out that gift shop!

03:07.440 --> 03:09.359
Right now.
Now, now, now, now, now.

03:09.480 --> 03:13.799
But don't we usually go
to the gift shop last?

03:13.920 --> 03:16.519
- After we've seen stuff?
- Sure.

03:16.640 --> 03:19.079
But cowgirls
don't play by the rules here!

03:19.200 --> 03:22.160
It's the Wild West! Yeehaw!

03:22.600 --> 03:23.760
Oops! Aaah!

03:24.799 --> 03:26.799
Whoa! Got it!

03:26.920 --> 03:30.840
Thanks, Ollie!
I nearly lost my new lasso!

03:30.959 --> 03:33.679
I guess I get a little careless
when I get excited, huh?

03:33.799 --> 03:36.959
Yeah. How about I hang onto
your lasso for you?

03:37.079 --> 03:38.880
Are you sure
you can keep it safe?

03:39.000 --> 03:42.760
Moon, I'm an extremely
careful cat.

03:42.880 --> 03:46.040
Your lasso
is totally safe with...

03:47.359 --> 03:49.799
- me?
- Come on, partner.

03:49.920 --> 03:53.519
- Let's gallop to the gift shop!
- I lost Moon's lasso!

03:53.640 --> 03:55.480
What am I gonna do?

03:57.600 --> 04:02.320
Will you look at that, Ollie?
A map, just like yours!

04:02.440 --> 04:04.799
- It is just like yours, right?
- Uh-huh.

04:04.920 --> 04:07.480
Uh, I mean... Thought so!

04:07.600 --> 04:09.799
Now, you wait here
and enjoy the scenery,

04:09.920 --> 04:12.560
and I'll just grab us
some drinks.

04:12.679 --> 04:15.359
Me, alone. Just buying
some drinks and nothing else.

04:15.480 --> 04:18.120
Not lemonade.
Not a map, either.

04:18.240 --> 04:20.200
[gasps] Moon's lasso!

04:20.320 --> 04:24.240
I think I'll enjoy the scenery
over there! Way over there!

04:24.360 --> 04:25.880
- OK.
- Good.

04:26.000 --> 04:27.800
- Sounds normal.
- Totally.

04:27.920 --> 04:29.400
- Then bye!
- See ya!

04:29.640 --> 04:30.640
[nervous laugh]

04:30.760 --> 04:32.640
- Phew.
- Phew.

04:32.760 --> 04:36.599
There you are!
I'm Polly, your park guide!

04:36.719 --> 04:38.800
Found my very first clients!
Check! Did that.

04:38.919 --> 04:40.640
So that is done.

04:40.760 --> 04:44.039
Now, follow me for your amazing
Grand Canyon adventure tour!

04:44.159 --> 04:45.360
- Huh?
- But...

04:45.479 --> 04:47.039
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

04:47.159 --> 04:49.520
But we didn't sign up
for a tour!

04:54.960 --> 04:56.599
How did this tour happen?

04:56.719 --> 04:59.680
Polly is way stronger
than she looks.

04:59.800 --> 05:03.000
Also, the Grand Canyon
is more than a mile deep!

05:03.120 --> 05:05.200
Can you believe it?
Plus, you'll find -

05:05.320 --> 05:08.400
Excuse me! How long is the tour?

05:08.520 --> 05:11.039
Will it be over before five
when the gift shop closes?

05:11.159 --> 05:14.400
[chuckles]
Who needs stuff from a gift shop

05:14.520 --> 05:17.680
when you're making
memories up here?

05:17.800 --> 05:22.039
- Uh... Actually...
- Whoa! Whoa! Slow down!

05:22.159 --> 05:27.359
Excuse me, but I'm afraid
of heights... and mules!

05:27.479 --> 05:30.599
How about a tour
of the bike path instead?

05:30.719 --> 05:32.960
- The one up there?
- Sure thing!

05:33.080 --> 05:36.359
But we have to go all the way
down this trail

05:36.479 --> 05:40.680
before we can go
back up the other trail!

05:40.800 --> 05:43.280
So, relax and enjoy!

05:45.760 --> 05:48.000
Relaxing and enjoying. Check!

05:48.120 --> 05:50.520
Feeling woozy. Check.

05:55.080 --> 05:57.919
Check! We made it
to the Colorado river!

05:58.039 --> 06:00.520
You can dismount now,
because that is done.

06:00.640 --> 06:03.280
- The lasso!
- And we did do that. Next...

06:03.400 --> 06:05.599
- We should canoe! Right now!
- Ollie?

06:05.719 --> 06:08.200
What's gotten into you?
You don't like water!

06:08.320 --> 06:12.200
Er... Yes, but I know
how much you love it, Moon.

06:12.320 --> 06:14.640
- So... Come on!
- Well, look at that.

06:14.760 --> 06:17.560
Canoeing just so happens
to be the next activity.

06:17.680 --> 06:20.080
Great! Let's head to
the other side of the river.

06:20.960 --> 06:22.159
Now, now, now!

06:22.280 --> 06:24.039
But that'll take
forever-ever-ever!

06:24.159 --> 06:27.479
Hmm. And the checklist says
we're supposed to go this way

06:27.599 --> 06:29.640
to get the trail to go back up.

06:29.960 --> 06:33.000
Good plan.
Check lists are so important...

06:33.280 --> 06:36.039
to follow quickly,
so we don't miss the gift shop!

06:36.159 --> 06:37.919
Let's go!

06:38.039 --> 06:40.799
And we're hopping in and life
jackets and check and check!

06:40.919 --> 06:43.000
Now, before we start paddling,

06:43.120 --> 06:46.760
I'll tell you all about
the flora and fauna of the area.

06:47.159 --> 06:49.680
[both] Before we start paddling?

06:49.799 --> 06:53.080
Now, the Grand Canyon is home
to a stunning array of birds,

06:53.200 --> 06:55.039
mammals, reptiles,
and fish species!

06:55.159 --> 06:57.400
Including coyotes, iguanas,
bats,

06:57.520 --> 06:59.520
striped bass and bald eagles.

06:59.640 --> 07:01.479
Informational talk, check.

07:01.599 --> 07:04.159
And now I can finally
untie the rope!

07:05.200 --> 07:06.919
- The rope?
- Ugh!

07:07.039 --> 07:09.760
We've been tied to the shore
this whole time

07:09.880 --> 07:13.120
- and haven't gotten anywhere?
- Rope untied.

07:13.239 --> 07:16.159
So, I did that. Check!

07:16.280 --> 07:19.440
Moon, you're right. Everything
important is up there.

07:19.560 --> 07:22.919
The view, the gift shop...
your lasso...

07:23.039 --> 07:24.039
Your map.

07:24.159 --> 07:26.919
We need to get to that trail
and hike back up to the top.

07:27.239 --> 07:28.880
And fast!

07:33.880 --> 07:35.960
Now, let's see what's next.

07:36.080 --> 07:38.520
Whoo!
Another informational talk.

07:38.640 --> 07:41.120
[whistles]
You better settle in, guys!

07:41.239 --> 07:44.120
Looks like this one's a doozy.

07:44.239 --> 07:45.560
Now, the Grand Canyon is home...

07:46.039 --> 07:48.680
- Thinking what I'm thinking?
- Check.

07:48.799 --> 07:52.159

<i>- ♪ That's what we are ♪</i>

08:15.400 --> 08:17.520
And that's why the Grand Canyon

08:17.640 --> 08:20.719
is one the world's
seven natural wonders.

08:20.840 --> 08:23.760
And I did say all that
and check!

08:23.880 --> 08:27.159
Now we'll start the climb
back up the scenic trail.

08:27.280 --> 08:30.760
Er, Polly, actually,
we're already here!

08:30.880 --> 08:35.360
Oh! Well, then that's done!
Check! Now, let's see...

08:38.559 --> 08:41.520
Thank you! I'll put it
in the lost-and-found box.

08:41.640 --> 08:45.000
- So, thank you so much, Polly!
- Gotta be going now!

08:45.120 --> 08:46.520
- Thanks a lot!
- But...

08:46.640 --> 08:49.400
you can't miss the big finish!

08:49.520 --> 08:53.959
We still need to "Enjoy
the majesty of the Grand Canyon

08:54.079 --> 08:57.319
for two minutes whilst listening
to inspirational music!"

08:57.439 --> 09:00.600
- We'd love to, really.
- But we just can't.

09:00.720 --> 09:04.040
But it's the last check
on my list!

09:04.160 --> 09:07.079
- [sighs] OK.
- But just for a minute.

09:08.079 --> 09:12.360
[pan flute]

09:22.240 --> 09:24.160
[music stops]

09:24.720 --> 09:26.560
- [music starts again]
- [gasps]

09:30.040 --> 09:32.079
[contented sigh]

09:32.199 --> 09:34.720
Your tour is complete. Check!

09:34.839 --> 09:36.839
- Thanks! Bye!
- Thank you! So long!

09:36.959 --> 09:38.079
[panting]

09:39.400 --> 09:41.760
No!

09:41.880 --> 09:43.360
Wait!

09:43.480 --> 09:46.280
No!

09:47.439 --> 09:50.079
The gift shop is closed!

09:50.199 --> 09:51.959
You're sad?

09:52.079 --> 09:56.079
Oh, you can't be sad at the most
beautiful place on Earth!

09:56.199 --> 09:58.600
- Whoa!
- Awesome!

09:58.720 --> 10:01.040
The canyon's so huge
and beautiful

10:01.160 --> 10:04.400
it just makes all your problems
seem small, doesn't it?

10:04.520 --> 10:07.360
It does. It really does.

10:07.480 --> 10:10.040
- Wait, what's wrong?
- You have a problem?

10:10.160 --> 10:11.280
[both] Can I help?

10:12.760 --> 10:15.680
Oh, Ollie,
I was afraid to tell you,

10:15.800 --> 10:18.720
but I ruined your map
playing with my new lasso!

10:18.839 --> 10:21.880
I was going to get you
a new one in there.

10:22.000 --> 10:25.720
And I was afraid to tell you,
but I lost your lasso!

10:25.839 --> 10:29.319
Now it's in
the lost-and-found box in there.

10:29.439 --> 10:31.800
Why didn't we tell each other?

10:31.920 --> 10:33.680
We could have helped each other.

10:33.800 --> 10:37.040
And why didn't you tell me?
I have a key to the gift shop!

10:37.160 --> 10:38.640
- You do?
- Polly!

10:38.760 --> 10:41.040
- You're the best guide ever!
- Oh.

10:41.160 --> 10:42.560
[chuckles]

10:45.120 --> 10:48.760
- What a great trip.
- You said it, Moon.

10:48.880 --> 10:50.720
- Whoops!
- Yeehaw!

10:50.839 --> 10:53.040
Thanks, Moon!
You're getting good at that!

10:53.160 --> 10:56.120
Always glad to help
with a problem, partner.

10:56.240 --> 10:59.360
[laughter]

11:00.160 --> 11:03.199
[lively music]
