WEBVTT

00:02.294 --> 00:03.836
Previously on Justified...

00:03.921 --> 00:06.923
I'll send Johnny to tell you
where this hand of God will strike next.

00:07.174 --> 00:10.551
You're wasting your time,
you think I'm doing anything on your behalf.

00:10.636 --> 00:13.388
"We know you ran Bo's
protection racket into the dirt."

00:13.472 --> 00:15.848
So it don't take a prophet
to see the future from here.

00:15.933 --> 00:19.102
Okay? You can either sit around,
waiting to catch a bullet

00:20.104 --> 00:21.104
or...

00:21.438 --> 00:23.940
Or you can accept protection
from the Marshals Service.

00:34.243 --> 00:35.785
We got two options.

00:36.203 --> 00:39.706
We either run or you kill Bo.

00:41.208 --> 00:45.461
You are leaving with me if I have to
arrest you and put you in handcuffs.

00:48.215 --> 00:49.966
I need her to stay at your place tonight.

00:50.217 --> 00:51.300
What's going on?

00:53.387 --> 00:54.387
There have been threats.

00:55.556 --> 00:57.557
Did you screw things up with her?

00:58.475 --> 01:00.059
What do you think?

01:00.853 --> 01:04.438
Well, I say if you're gonna be a bear,
be a grizzly.

01:05.107 --> 01:08.192
But this, my friends, is a Kodiak.

01:14.825 --> 01:17.034
Bo thinks I ripped him off.

01:17.703 --> 01:21.122
- Didn't you?
- I skimmed my share, but that's all.

01:21.206 --> 01:24.000
- So you ripped him off.
- Isn't that what I just said?

01:27.129 --> 01:30.465
So, how much money did you collect
for Bo Crowder while he was inside?

01:31.133 --> 01:33.468
Must have been $100,000, $150,000.

01:34.011 --> 01:36.304
I took my cut and passed the rest to Johnny.

01:37.514 --> 01:39.182
So how does he figure
that you owe him money?

01:39.391 --> 01:41.934
Collections fell off. One thing led to another.

01:42.019 --> 01:43.478
New guys pushed the old ones out,

01:43.562 --> 01:46.397
and I couldn't get nothing out of them
without Bo's muscle.

01:46.523 --> 01:49.901
So now he wants his pound of flesh,
and you don't have it to give him.

01:50.194 --> 01:54.864
Whatever I know about Bo's operations,
such as they were, I'll tell you.

01:55.157 --> 01:57.325
Well, the problem with that
is the statute of limitations.

01:57.409 --> 01:59.118
It varies with each crime.

01:59.203 --> 02:02.205
Did you see anyone get murdered,
kidnapped?

02:02.706 --> 02:05.500
Anything that could help us make
a convincing RICO case?

02:05.834 --> 02:06.876
RICO?

02:07.377 --> 02:11.214
- Racketeering.
- Yeah. Bo sure as hell had a racket.

02:11.423 --> 02:13.758
- So could you give us names and dates?
- Probably not.

02:13.884 --> 02:15.802
- What about Boyd?
- I never worked with Boyd.

02:15.886 --> 02:17.220
No, what I'm...

02:17.346 --> 02:21.098
What Raylan's trying to say here is that
we're not so much interested in the past.

02:21.225 --> 02:23.309
We're focusing more on present tense.

02:23.393 --> 02:25.728
What the hell does that mean?

02:26.772 --> 02:29.774
It means that if you want Bo Crowder
out of your life,

02:29.900 --> 02:33.110
you're gonna have to find a way to
worm your way back into his good graces.

02:33.237 --> 02:35.863
Give us some rock-solid information,
like Boyd.

02:35.948 --> 02:39.283
And the death of this guy
in a meth-lab explosion.

02:43.747 --> 02:45.456
You want me to be a snitch.

02:46.250 --> 02:51.128
It's astounding to me that you're just now
realizing that's why we're here.

02:57.719 --> 02:58.928
What's it pay?

03:38.468 --> 03:41.637
Mr. Crowder, how was the flight?

03:44.933 --> 03:46.309
You know, I don't really like to fly,

03:46.435 --> 03:50.271
but that private jet of yours
beats the hell out of coach.

03:50.647 --> 03:53.649
I do appreciate you coming down
to talk face to face.

03:53.775 --> 03:56.569
Well, it didn't seem like I had much choice.

03:56.653 --> 03:58.821
No, I suppose you didn't.

04:00.490 --> 04:02.658
This is Ernesto and Pilar.

04:03.660 --> 04:06.871
They have been with me for over 10 years.

04:07.205 --> 04:09.457
I trust them with my life.

04:09.541 --> 04:12.793
Now, tomorrow they'll get into a truck,
start driving,

04:13.211 --> 04:17.505
and, in two days, deliver
the shipment of ephedrine you requested.

04:19.176 --> 04:21.344
You brought me all the way
down here to tell me that?

04:21.553 --> 04:22.803
No.

04:23.347 --> 04:27.224
I flew you down here to make sure
you understand the consequences

04:27.351 --> 04:30.478
of accepting this much product
on consignment.

04:33.190 --> 04:34.857
You know what the short bus is?

04:35.025 --> 04:36.108
A short bus?

04:36.193 --> 04:38.819
It's the pequeÃ±o bus for slow kids.

04:38.904 --> 04:40.905
You know,
to take them to the special school.

04:41.031 --> 04:44.283
You know, I may not own a private plane
or a fancy car,

04:44.368 --> 04:46.869
and when you look at me, you probably
just see some dumb redneck

04:46.995 --> 04:50.206
who likes to eat roadkill for breakfast
and have sex with his cousins.

04:50.999 --> 04:53.084
I don't eat roadkill,
I don't screw my relatives,

04:53.210 --> 04:56.087
and I didn't just get off of no short bus.

04:56.213 --> 04:59.340
So for you to bring me
all the way down here to threaten me,

04:59.424 --> 05:03.928
as if I didn't already fully understand
the stakes of our business agreement,

05:04.054 --> 05:06.389
hoss, that's just downright insulting.

05:08.016 --> 05:10.726
Your attitude strikes me as cavalier.

05:10.936 --> 05:15.439
I lost Hunter, another associate
I sent down to Kentucky,

05:15.565 --> 05:19.902
and two men on the Mexican border,
all at the hand of the US Marshal

05:20.028 --> 05:23.155
who shot an associate
of mine named Tommy Bucks.

05:23.240 --> 05:25.533
Not too far from where
we're standing right now.

05:25.617 --> 05:27.618
- Raylan Givens.
- Yes.

05:28.578 --> 05:30.871
Now, I hear he's not
a huge fan of yours either.

05:31.623 --> 05:32.832
Probably not.

05:32.916 --> 05:34.417
But the good news is,

05:34.543 --> 05:37.586
I can swallow that asshole
with a short glass of water.

05:38.213 --> 05:43.926
The deal: $2 million, repaid on equal
installments over the next six months.

05:44.261 --> 05:47.388
You have the resources and demand
to make that schedule?

05:47.889 --> 05:50.266
If I didn't, I wouldn't be here.

05:54.646 --> 05:58.190
You weren't too concerned about procedure
when he was saving your ass.

05:58.275 --> 06:00.818
No, and now we owe him, apparently.

06:00.944 --> 06:04.155
This isn't about the girl, is it, Gary?
This is about the fact that Raylan was here.

06:04.281 --> 06:07.450
Yeah, well, he found his way in here
pretty damn fast.

06:07.576 --> 06:09.410
This is a nice house.

06:09.494 --> 06:12.246
- Winona, right?
- Yes. Good morning.

06:12.330 --> 06:15.291
- Hey, I'm Gary. I'm Winona's husband.
- Hi.

06:16.626 --> 06:19.670
Good for you. Going to the gym.

06:20.130 --> 06:22.673
Well, I am sorry to shake and run.

06:25.135 --> 06:27.970
- How do you take your coffee?
- With a little bourbon.

06:29.556 --> 06:31.474
- All right.
- Hope I didn't put y'all out.

06:31.558 --> 06:33.350
No.

06:36.188 --> 06:39.065
- Sorry. I feel bad.
- Well, it's okay.

06:40.358 --> 06:42.860
You know what? I do.
I appreciate your hospitality.

06:42.944 --> 06:45.821
But if y'all have a phone book,
I'd love to call a taxi.

06:46.448 --> 06:48.866
I think Raylan wanted to talk
to you before you went anywhere.

06:48.950 --> 06:51.744
Yeah, well, I'd just as soon
get out of your hair.

06:53.997 --> 06:55.790
You know, it's not my place to say,
and you're a big girl.

06:55.874 --> 06:56.957
- You can do whatever you want, but...
- Right,

06:57.042 --> 06:59.960
and whatever he's coming here to tell me,
I heard before.

07:00.170 --> 07:01.337
Okay.

07:03.173 --> 07:05.257
Do you think you can get Bo Crowder
to trust you again?

07:05.342 --> 07:07.927
It ain't about trust with Bo.
It's about being useful.

07:08.011 --> 07:11.222
- Think you can make yourself useful again?
- Maybe.

07:11.306 --> 07:12.765
All due respect, Mr. Givens,

07:12.849 --> 07:14.475
I can't go to my supervisor with "maybe."

07:14.559 --> 07:18.562
You want the Crowders behind bars,
but you ain't putting anything into the game.

07:18.647 --> 07:21.357
I got everything to lose,
and you got nothing.

07:23.819 --> 07:25.861
What are you looking for, Mr. Givens?

07:25.946 --> 07:28.114
I got to pay Bo something.

07:28.573 --> 07:30.241
Take some of the pressure off.

07:30.325 --> 07:32.326
Okay, fine. How much we talking?

07:32.577 --> 07:34.620
100 grand. Cash.

07:35.038 --> 07:37.164
- Okay, so we go with 20.
- Bo wants 100.

07:37.249 --> 07:40.292
Bo will take 20,
and you'll offer to work off the rest.

07:40.502 --> 07:41.877
Blanket immunity.

07:44.673 --> 07:45.798
I'll see what I can do.

07:46.007 --> 07:48.634
You'll have to check in periodically
with the Deputy Marshal,

07:48.718 --> 07:51.262
report on everything you've learned
about Crowder's operations.

07:51.513 --> 07:53.180
I say he wears a wire.

07:55.851 --> 07:59.270
You want to keep everything
aboveboard with that man, send him in hot.

07:59.354 --> 08:01.438
Bullshit on that score.

08:03.275 --> 08:04.358
I'm not insisting on that.

08:04.442 --> 08:08.154
Fellows, do we want to spend years here
building a case against Bo,

08:08.238 --> 08:10.614
or do we want to get something now,
on tape,

08:10.699 --> 08:13.325
that can stop Boyd and these guys
from killing people?

08:14.828 --> 08:15.911
Chief, how's your coffee here?

08:15.996 --> 08:17.037
- Bad.
- Bad.

08:17.122 --> 08:18.831
Let's get some.

08:19.749 --> 08:22.126
Guess being useful runs both ways.

08:22.210 --> 08:26.881
Difference is, you're so eager to use me,
you don't mind it might get me killed.

08:26.965 --> 08:30.551
Arlo, only reason you're here
is because you ain't got any other play left.

08:30.635 --> 08:32.803
You want to make more of it than that, fine.

08:32.888 --> 08:36.682
But everything that led to this
moment was your choice.

08:36.808 --> 08:39.727
You'd have rather seen me
down the mines my whole life,

08:40.020 --> 08:42.188
dead of black lung, like my old man.

08:42.272 --> 08:43.438
You never would have worked that hard.

08:43.523 --> 08:46.650
You are a miserable son of a bitch, Raylan.

08:46.735 --> 08:50.529
I'm glad your mama didn't live
to see how you turned out.

08:50.614 --> 08:54.074
- You best keep her out of this.
- I ain't wearing no goddamn wire!

08:56.912 --> 08:58.245
Fine.

08:59.289 --> 09:00.623
Go.

09:04.211 --> 09:06.837
Go on. Go on! Get!

09:13.762 --> 09:16.555
You see if Bo's hospitality
is any better than ours.

09:21.144 --> 09:23.020
That went well.

09:26.316 --> 09:29.568
Well, you care to recuse yourself
from this one?

09:30.403 --> 09:33.155
No, maybe later, like after breakfast.

09:34.616 --> 09:37.826
It's gonna be a long time before anybody
gets a shot like this at Bo again.

09:37.911 --> 09:41.497
Even without a wire,
that old man could be an asset.

09:41.581 --> 09:44.375
If he's in as deep as he says he is,
he'll wear a wire.

09:45.043 --> 09:46.210
No. That's enough.

09:47.212 --> 09:51.423
I'm the chief, this is my office,
it's my informant and it's my call.

09:52.384 --> 09:56.095
And that's my bottle,
and I'm not gonna let you drink it all

09:56.221 --> 09:59.390
just because your daddy didn't
hug you much when you were little.

10:00.433 --> 10:02.851
Now, if you're not gonna
recuse yourself from this,

10:02.978 --> 10:04.061
you're gonna suck it up

10:04.145 --> 10:06.355
and you're gonna take your ass down there
to Harlan tomorrow

10:06.439 --> 10:08.816
and you're gonna convince your father
to come back in here.

10:08.900 --> 10:11.318
And if he doesn't want to wear a wire,
then he's not gonna wear one.

10:12.153 --> 10:13.737
You gonna take responsibility?

10:14.155 --> 10:16.031
Well, I take responsibility for you.

10:16.116 --> 10:19.868
I reckon I can take responsibility
for your old man, too.

10:29.087 --> 10:30.546
- Maybe that's them.
- It's Raylan.

10:31.047 --> 10:32.089
Hi.

10:32.340 --> 10:35.134
I'm gonna be late.
Can you hang around for just a little longer?

10:35.969 --> 10:37.219
I don't think I'm gonna need to.

10:37.554 --> 10:39.263
Why? She still there?

10:39.347 --> 10:41.640
Yeah, she's fine.
She's right here, but she's leaving.

10:41.725 --> 10:42.766
Hang on.

10:44.936 --> 10:47.354
- Hello.
- What's going on? You all right?

10:47.480 --> 10:49.732
I'm sweating it out, but I'm okay.

10:49.941 --> 10:51.275
You're leaving for where?

10:51.359 --> 10:54.403
Look, I know what you're gonna say
and I want to say something first.

10:55.697 --> 10:57.239
You were right, okay?

10:58.199 --> 10:59.450
Okay.

11:00.076 --> 11:03.704
I made up my mind.
I'm gonna stay out of Harlan.

11:04.247 --> 11:06.832
I'm gonna go to my friend Jody's house,

11:06.916 --> 11:10.252
from the salon, and I'm gonna stay there
until things blow over.

11:10.337 --> 11:11.378
Jody?

11:11.671 --> 11:14.465
In Riverbrook. She's okay. I'll be fine.

11:15.008 --> 11:16.967
I need to get out of this house.

11:18.470 --> 11:19.845
I understand.

11:20.013 --> 11:23.223
That's my taxi. So I have to go.

11:23.308 --> 11:26.810
Okay, Ava. You take care, you hear?

11:29.397 --> 11:32.691
I guess you can turn around,
save the taxpayers some gas money, huh?

11:33.026 --> 11:35.903
Winona, thank you. I know this put you out.

11:36.071 --> 11:39.323
Yeah, well, I'd say you owe me, cowboy,
but I think maybe I still owe you.

11:39.407 --> 11:40.824
Although, we could call it even.

11:41.618 --> 11:42.659
Maybe.

11:43.328 --> 11:44.870
I'll see you later.

11:44.954 --> 11:47.039
All right, bye, Raylan.

11:47.957 --> 11:52.544
Well, you guys are pretty civil
for divorced people.

11:54.005 --> 11:56.757
Well, yeah, it's kind of hard
to stay mad at Raylan.

11:57.133 --> 11:58.967
Yeah, well, I wouldn't know.
I'm just getting started.

11:59.052 --> 12:00.094
Thanks for everything.

12:01.554 --> 12:04.848
This location gives you gentlemen easy
access to two major highways

12:04.933 --> 12:06.892
and the railroad depot in Pineville.

12:07.018 --> 12:08.435
How close are the neighbors?

12:08.728 --> 12:11.021
Half a mile, I believe.

12:11.773 --> 12:14.483
Exactly what business is it
y'all said you were in, again?

12:14.567 --> 12:18.779
Exactly what business is it of yours
what business we're in?

12:18.863 --> 12:22.658
- He's just kidding.
- We manufacture wooden furniture.

12:23.201 --> 12:26.328
The reason I asked about the neighbors
is the table saws can get pretty loud.

12:26.663 --> 12:28.539
You know, Martha,
we're gonna need to confer

12:28.623 --> 12:30.666
to see if this is gonna meet all our needs.

12:30.750 --> 12:32.709
Don't you want to see
the restroom facilities?

12:32.794 --> 12:35.337
Absolutely. Yeah.
That would be Johnny's department.

12:35.422 --> 12:37.673
Johnny, check that out for us, will you?

12:45.348 --> 12:47.766
Did I forget to tell you
to keep your goddamn mouth shut?

12:47.851 --> 12:51.979
Hey, I was just trying to keep that
real estate dyke from sniffing our shit.

12:52.063 --> 12:53.397
Listen, Lynyrd Skynyrd,

12:53.481 --> 12:56.316
next time I'm opening a dick-sucking
business, I'll ask for your advice.

12:58.695 --> 13:00.571
I don't want to be here more than a week.

13:00.655 --> 13:02.739
Is that enough time for you
to cook the whole shipment?

13:02.949 --> 13:07.202
I'll bring in the boiling flasks, the measuring
beakers and the graduated cylinders.

13:07.579 --> 13:08.787
I've got the iodine and lye,

13:08.872 --> 13:11.540
and should have the red phosphorus
and sulfuric acid by the end of the day.

13:11.624 --> 13:13.709
Tomorrow at the latest.

13:14.461 --> 13:16.712
Give me what I asked for,
you'll get what you want.

13:16.963 --> 13:18.297
I better.

13:42.906 --> 13:45.824
- What the hell you doing?
- Well, hello, angel baby.

13:45.909 --> 13:47.075
How you been?

13:47.160 --> 13:49.411
We're just watching some TV,
having some beers.

13:49.579 --> 13:51.955
Well, no shit.
Why you doing it in my house?

13:52.207 --> 13:54.458
I was under the impression
this is Bowman's house.

13:55.210 --> 13:57.044
Bowman's dead.

13:57.837 --> 13:59.796
Well, surely, he is.

14:00.381 --> 14:07.304
But Bo said that, despite Bowman's
untimely death,

14:08.473 --> 14:10.224
this house was still in the Crowder family.

14:10.308 --> 14:12.643
And since I didn't have no place
to go to watch my DVDs,

14:12.727 --> 14:13.810
he said I could come here.

14:14.938 --> 14:16.813
You're welcome to join us, if you want to.

14:17.106 --> 14:18.690
Aren't I a little old for you?

14:19.776 --> 14:22.236
A little. I can close my eyes.

15:13.288 --> 15:14.580
You can put the gun away.

15:16.749 --> 15:19.042
- What is it?
- Can I come in?

15:20.295 --> 15:21.461
Yeah.

15:29.012 --> 15:30.762
Everything okay?

15:31.556 --> 15:33.557
Something wrong with Gary?

18:43.498 --> 18:44.956
Hello, Mr. Givens.

18:45.082 --> 18:46.166
Ms. Crowder.

18:46.834 --> 18:48.460
How you been since your heart attack?

18:49.420 --> 18:52.214
- Can't complain.
- But he will.

18:53.508 --> 18:55.008
What can I do for you?

18:55.176 --> 18:57.677
Actually, I came to see your wife.

18:58.971 --> 19:00.889
What do you want to talk to Helen about?

19:00.973 --> 19:05.185
I imagine she would have told you
if it was any of your business.

19:08.356 --> 19:11.316
- Is he expecting someone?
- UPS man.

19:12.068 --> 19:13.443
He has a bad attitude.

19:15.029 --> 19:17.781
So what do you want to see me about?

19:17.865 --> 19:19.616
I need a gun.

19:19.700 --> 19:21.034
What for?

19:21.202 --> 19:23.537
Well, Bo's been harassing me.

19:23.621 --> 19:25.580
Why aren't you up in Lexington?

19:25.665 --> 19:28.333
Turns out there's nothing for me
in Lexington.

19:28.417 --> 19:30.418
Isn't Raylan watching your back?

19:30.545 --> 19:33.505
Well, he's got his eyes on other things.

19:33.589 --> 19:34.840
Why me?

19:35.341 --> 19:39.511
There must be any number of places
you could go to arm yourself.

19:39.595 --> 19:41.847
Well, you understand the Crowders.

19:41.931 --> 19:45.100
And you always struck me as a woman
that takes things into her own hands,

19:45.184 --> 19:47.269
and I intend to do that.

19:47.395 --> 19:51.189
I thought maybe you came to me
because you were hoping I'd tell Raylan.

19:51.274 --> 19:52.941
I wouldn't have come
if I thought you were gonna tell him,

19:53.067 --> 19:55.110
and I'm trusting that you won't.

19:55.194 --> 20:00.407
Now, he thinks I'm laying low in Lexington,
and that's the way I'd like to keep it.

20:01.117 --> 20:05.412
Look, Ava, you've proven yourself
capable of shooting a man,

20:05.580 --> 20:07.289
an act all the women of Harlan applauded.

20:07.373 --> 20:09.791
Too bad no one did anything about it
before it got to that.

20:09.917 --> 20:13.086
Be that as it may,
you really want to go up against Bo?

20:13.546 --> 20:15.797
You won't catch him
with his mouth full of supper.

20:15.923 --> 20:18.049
If he wanted to kill me, I'd already be dead.

20:19.051 --> 20:21.136
I just got to show him I'm not scared.

20:21.262 --> 20:23.471
And I need to clear some riffraff
off my property.

20:26.100 --> 20:29.978
You want a hunting rifle,
a full-barreled shotgun or a sawed-off?

20:30.813 --> 20:32.314
Sawed-off would be good.

20:32.398 --> 20:35.066
When you get on the path of righteousness,
ladies and gentlemen,

20:35.151 --> 20:37.402
the Lord will forgive you.

20:37.570 --> 20:38.570
- Amen.
- Amen.

20:38.654 --> 20:40.655
And transform you.

20:41.157 --> 20:42.991
And enlighten you.

20:43.117 --> 20:46.828
And you will look back in awe
and wonder about the miracle

20:46.913 --> 20:49.497
God has worked in your life.
Can I hear an amen?

20:49.624 --> 20:53.251
- Amen! Amen!
- Amen! Amen!

20:54.503 --> 20:58.006
You will know the truth,
and the truth will make you free.

20:58.132 --> 21:01.676
- Can I get a witness here today?
- I am your witness.

21:01.761 --> 21:04.596
- I am your witness.
- Come on up here, son.

21:04.680 --> 21:06.681
Tell us how you got over.

21:06.807 --> 21:08.350
Come on, Boyd.

21:09.685 --> 21:10.685
Come on, brother!

21:11.020 --> 21:12.187
Yes!

21:22.031 --> 21:25.200
Well, as many of you good people
may remember,

21:25.868 --> 21:29.037
I was a hateful man and I was a sinful man,

21:30.373 --> 21:35.877
seeking my way through the darkness,
looking for salvation in worldly things

21:38.881 --> 21:40.548
and evil things.

21:41.676 --> 21:44.886
Like Saul on the road to Damascus,

21:45.012 --> 21:47.555
I was long gone on a sinful journey,

21:47.640 --> 21:50.558
when the light of the Lord
shone upon me on my deathbed

21:50.685 --> 21:52.143
in a prison hospital.

21:53.062 --> 21:54.729
And, brothers and sisters,
I'm here to tell you today

21:54.855 --> 21:58.650
that bullet missed my heart,
but it struck my soul.

21:59.652 --> 22:02.904
It struck it. For I was blinded.

22:03.072 --> 22:07.242
I was blinded.
I could no longer see ungodly truth.

22:08.202 --> 22:11.913
For if any man be born again in Christ

22:13.040 --> 22:15.000
is a new creature,

22:15.084 --> 22:18.753
well, I am a new...

22:18.879 --> 22:21.172
A new creature.

22:21.590 --> 22:23.508
- I am a new creature.
- Thank you, Boyd. Thank you, Boyd.

22:23.592 --> 22:25.844
Not quite finished yet, Reverend.

22:25.928 --> 22:28.013
By all means, continue.

22:28.097 --> 22:29.180
Now...

22:29.265 --> 22:34.269
- Now, Jesus entered a temple in Jerusalem.
- Yes, he did.

22:34.937 --> 22:38.940
He found moneylenders buying and selling
where they should have been a-praying.

22:39.066 --> 22:40.942
He called their church a den of thieves.

22:42.278 --> 22:45.780
And he turned over their tables.
He cast out the robbers!

22:45.865 --> 22:48.783
- He cast them out! He cast them out!
- Hallelujah!

22:48.909 --> 22:52.871
He cast them out! And like Jesus...
Like Jesus...

22:53.247 --> 22:58.710
Like Jesus, we must never be afraid
to strike out against those who practice evil.

22:59.420 --> 23:03.131
We must take the high road
of righteousness,

23:04.091 --> 23:09.471
even if it means walking, walking
and leaving our own flesh and blood behind.

23:11.640 --> 23:16.436
Because there is no greater piety,
brothers and sisters,

23:17.730 --> 23:19.647
- than the love of God.
- Amen.

23:19.774 --> 23:21.483
Amen to that!

23:22.109 --> 23:23.985
He is my one true father.

23:25.488 --> 23:28.656
There is no other.
There is no other, Preacher.

23:28.991 --> 23:30.742
There's no other.

23:37.666 --> 23:40.001
You probably don't remember
the first time I ever brought you here.

23:40.127 --> 23:41.669
You were too young.

23:41.754 --> 23:44.089
You hated it, whined all the
way through the damn thing,

23:44.173 --> 23:45.840
embarrassed the hell out of your mother.

23:45.925 --> 23:48.927
This place was always a building to me.
An empty shell.

23:49.011 --> 23:53.306
Only now do I see it as the house
of reckoning that it truly is.

23:53.849 --> 23:58.186
As a churchgoing man,
I admire your turnaround, Boyd.

23:58.604 --> 24:02.607
I could never walk the path,
though I understood its virtue.

24:02.691 --> 24:05.652
Your change has been remarkable, son.

24:05.861 --> 24:07.529
Having said that,

24:07.655 --> 24:11.533
you are getting severely goddamn close
to meeting your maker.

24:13.119 --> 24:16.121
You know, I continue to tell myself
that you are not an evil man,

24:16.831 --> 24:21.209
because I believe that in your heart,
you have the ability to do the right thing.

24:21.293 --> 24:25.213
But I will tell you something, Daddy,
and you mark my words.

24:25.840 --> 24:29.050
Now, you bring meth into our homes,
and I will destroy it.

24:30.386 --> 24:33.638
- You think that's funny?
- You know what's funny?

24:34.223 --> 24:38.726
You destroy me or my shit,
it's the same thing as destroying yourself.

24:39.395 --> 24:42.856
That there is Crowder gospel.
You mark them damn words, son.

24:51.866 --> 24:54.159
- Y'all can't park there.
- Yeah.

24:54.410 --> 24:55.577
US Marshals.

24:56.328 --> 24:59.747
Sheriff! This here's a US Marshal.

25:01.041 --> 25:03.585
- This ain't a federal show.
- I'm just looking for someone.

25:03.711 --> 25:04.836
He's not here.

25:05.546 --> 25:07.422
Did I do or say something to offend you?

25:07.715 --> 25:09.382
You ruined a good man's life.

25:09.925 --> 25:11.926
- Meaning Sheriff Hunter Mosley?
- Hunter Mosley.

25:12.011 --> 25:14.179
Right. Good. So you know who I am.

25:14.346 --> 25:18.349
Listen, I see a TAC team preparing to
enter a building that I think my father's in.

25:18.434 --> 25:22.228
- Your father?
- Arlo Givens, white hair, good height, 65.

25:23.272 --> 25:24.856
- Stand behind the tape.
- Is he inside?

25:24.940 --> 25:27.275
- Just stand behind the tape!
- Look, Sheriff,

25:27.401 --> 25:29.527
I don't know what you think I did
to Hunter Mosley,

25:29.612 --> 25:31.279
but I'm sure if you heard
my side of the story,

25:31.363 --> 25:33.364
we could have a civilized conversation
on the matter.

25:33.449 --> 25:36.034
Right now, I just want to know
what's going on.

25:38.037 --> 25:41.414
There's a kid inside,
a young Iraq vet they call Lucky.

25:41.874 --> 25:45.293
He's been at the VA.
His unit is being redeployed to Afghanistan,

25:45.377 --> 25:47.212
and he's not going.

25:47.296 --> 25:48.546
And he's got a grenade.

25:55.804 --> 25:56.971
I'm telling you, old-timer,

25:57.765 --> 26:00.266
you really don't want to be here.

26:01.810 --> 26:05.313
Only place in town that serves a drink.

26:11.195 --> 26:13.821
What you think you gonna say to me?

26:14.281 --> 26:18.201
I wasn't planning on saying anything.
I was just gonna drink.

26:19.036 --> 26:21.204
And if I release the spoon?

26:21.497 --> 26:23.289
I'm gonna run like hell.

26:23.999 --> 26:27.835
Until that time, I paid my dues,
I earned my entry.

26:29.129 --> 26:31.172
I'm gonna have my drink.

26:41.517 --> 26:44.352
You know how I got my nickname?

26:44.687 --> 26:47.689
My squad was preparing for a patrol.

26:49.608 --> 26:51.651
Right as we were about to pull out,

26:52.695 --> 26:56.197
I had a respiratory attack.

26:58.200 --> 27:03.204
When I woke up, they told me
my entire squad had been wiped out.

27:05.374 --> 27:08.334
Along with the soldier who took my place.

27:10.296 --> 27:13.881
They sent me back to the States
for treatment.

27:15.301 --> 27:19.345
Meanwhile, my unit's taking
heavy casualties.

27:20.723 --> 27:22.307
Seemed like every other week,

27:22.391 --> 27:25.393
I was given leave to go to another funeral,

27:27.813 --> 27:29.731
but I never went.

27:31.358 --> 27:34.402
I figured nobody wanted to talk to
the shitbag who was sitting on the sideline

27:34.528 --> 27:39.574
while the rest of them were getting their
asses handed to them out in the field.

27:40.326 --> 27:42.243
Then this Afghanistan
deployment comes up,

27:42.369 --> 27:44.746
and I figure this'll be my shot

27:45.497 --> 27:49.042
to make it up to them for
not being with them in Iraq.

27:50.919 --> 27:52.253
But, no!

27:53.922 --> 27:56.049
My lungs are still shit.

28:07.102 --> 28:12.231
My second month in Vietnam,
the squad leader leads us into an ambush.

28:13.609 --> 28:17.445
Half the squad gets killed.
The others captured.

28:17.780 --> 28:19.614
I dove into a bush.

28:20.616 --> 28:24.035
Can't explain how, but Charlie never saw me.

28:25.120 --> 28:28.706
I could have kept fighting,
but we were overrun and outnumbered,

28:28.791 --> 28:31.959
so I hunkered down, held my breath,

28:33.796 --> 28:35.296
and watched.

28:35.631 --> 28:40.385
Watched as they carried away
my best friend.

28:41.970 --> 28:44.972
Tennessee boy we called Blue.

28:47.726 --> 28:48.810
As they passed,

28:50.312 --> 28:53.481
Blue looked over and saw me hiding.

28:55.109 --> 28:59.487
I wanted to look away after we
made eye contact, I was so ashamed.

28:59.571 --> 29:01.781
But Blue's stare held me.

29:04.660 --> 29:07.286
Then the strangest thing happened.

29:08.664 --> 29:10.164
Blue smiled.

29:14.169 --> 29:17.338
Not a day goes by that I don't see that smile.

29:20.843 --> 29:22.802
You know what I think?

29:23.512 --> 29:27.098
I think maybe he was smiling
because I got away,

29:27.433 --> 29:31.269
just like I think the name
Lucky was given to you

29:31.353 --> 29:36.149
because it's a blessing, not a curse.

29:38.527 --> 29:42.530
But why me? Why do I get to live?

29:43.323 --> 29:47.702
What do I look like, some kind of holy man?
I can't answer that shit.

29:49.037 --> 29:52.039
The only answer I got is another question.

29:53.667 --> 29:55.001
Why not you?

30:11.143 --> 30:13.811
- Hold up.
- My guest.

30:23.197 --> 30:24.572
Have that drink now?

30:25.574 --> 30:26.908
All right.

30:27.826 --> 30:29.577
Two Kentuckys, Roy.

30:31.872 --> 30:32.914
You serve?

30:33.332 --> 30:36.918
My son's been fighting wars
since the day he was born.

30:45.427 --> 30:47.887
You heard all that out there?

30:48.597 --> 30:49.680
I did.

30:51.642 --> 30:54.644
You know that story was bullshit, right?

30:56.313 --> 30:57.688
I figured.

30:58.899 --> 31:00.816
It's a good story, though. It worked.

31:01.527 --> 31:02.652
Yep.

31:03.612 --> 31:05.029
Pretty good.

31:12.871 --> 31:14.705
I'll wear the wire.

31:16.875 --> 31:21.003
I just spent an hour next to a nut job
with a live grenade.

31:23.048 --> 31:27.093
Turns out I ain't as afraid of dying
as I used to be.

31:35.477 --> 31:36.561
Are you crazy?

31:36.645 --> 31:38.813
- Stay out of my way, Johnny.
- Ava. What are you doing?

31:39.314 --> 31:40.398
You gonna put another hand on me?

31:53.161 --> 31:54.287
Ava?

31:55.247 --> 31:57.498
Whatever you're discussing, finish it up.

31:58.041 --> 32:01.168
You can go on and head on out.
You get your girls ready for work.

32:01.420 --> 32:03.588
I'll take care of the rest.

32:08.719 --> 32:10.011
You setting up whores now?

32:10.262 --> 32:12.471
Why? You looking for work?

32:14.266 --> 32:18.477
Bo, it's not my fault that your son
was a wife-beating piece of shit.

32:18.812 --> 32:21.856
Now, if I hadn't done what I did,
he would have killed me.

32:21.940 --> 32:24.191
And you harassing me like this, it ain't right.

32:26.695 --> 32:29.947
Ava, I made aplenty of mistakes in my life,

32:30.032 --> 32:32.992
not the least of which
got to be raising my boys.

32:33.785 --> 32:36.537
I mean, hell, one of them turned out to be
a religious nut,

32:36.622 --> 32:37.705
and Bowman,

32:38.874 --> 32:39.957
for whatever reasons,

32:40.042 --> 32:44.003
Bowman had expectations for himself
that he never met.

32:44.087 --> 32:47.048
And, unfortunately,
he took his disappointment out on you.

32:47.341 --> 32:49.550
Now, I don't condone his actions.

32:49.885 --> 32:52.803
Hell, I ain't even saying he didn't
deserve a lot worse

32:52.888 --> 32:54.597
than getting shot at his kitchen table.

32:55.057 --> 32:56.098
What do you want?

32:56.391 --> 33:00.353
I want you to leave Kentucky
and never come back again.

33:01.021 --> 33:02.063
I ain't leaving.

33:02.648 --> 33:05.900
Well, I guess we got ourselves a real
problem, now, don't we, sugar?

33:06.443 --> 33:08.653
Honestly, I don't think we do.

33:09.154 --> 33:10.863
See, I killed one Crowder.

33:11.406 --> 33:15.326
I could easily kill another.
You want to go next?

33:17.287 --> 33:21.415
Johnny! I'm coming out!
You better not be holding!

33:22.334 --> 33:23.668
You hear that, Johnny?

33:24.044 --> 33:26.128
Yeah, yeah, I heard it.

33:46.900 --> 33:49.610
You want to get a few more guys in here?

33:50.696 --> 33:52.530
How you doing, Mr. Givens?

33:52.989 --> 33:54.240
Shitty.

33:55.450 --> 33:58.202
Every car I see, I think it's following me.

33:58.662 --> 34:02.123
I'm already paranoid,
and we haven't even done anything yet.

34:02.457 --> 34:04.083
- You got the money?
- Here it is.

34:04.167 --> 34:08.087
You need to initial there at the top
and sign at the bottom.

34:08.588 --> 34:11.172
Here's the money. Just so you know
how this is gonna go down,

34:11.257 --> 34:14.135
we're gonna park in the vicinity
of Johnny Crowder's bar,

34:14.219 --> 34:18.556
and as soon as we're in place,
we'll give you a call, let you know.

34:19.683 --> 34:21.809
Like to go over
what you're gonna say to Bo?

34:21.893 --> 34:26.563
I'm gonna plant my lips on his ass
and make him believe I'm for real.

34:26.857 --> 34:28.607
Where are you gonna tell him
you got this money from?

34:28.692 --> 34:32.570
I'll tell him I prostituted myself to old ladies.

34:32.696 --> 34:36.866
If that don't work, just tell him
it's the money you stole from Stan Perkins.

34:38.827 --> 34:41.536
Right. That's good.

34:55.051 --> 34:57.052
I am surprised to see you here.

34:57.846 --> 35:00.556
What you think I'm gonna do, run and hide?

35:01.057 --> 35:04.059
Strangely enough,
that's exactly what I thought you'd do.

35:04.144 --> 35:09.231
Hestler, you staying at least 500 feet away
from those elementary schools?

35:10.317 --> 35:11.942
What are you doing, Arlo?

35:12.277 --> 35:14.445
I'm trying to make things right, Bo.

35:16.031 --> 35:17.531
How are you planning on doing that?

35:17.657 --> 35:21.035
I brought some money
to make up for what I lost.

35:23.246 --> 35:27.541
But what I really would like to do, Bo,
is go back to work for you.

35:29.169 --> 35:33.964
I got to tell you, Arlo, you come in here
hat in hand trying to make a deal,

35:34.591 --> 35:37.259
I got to wonder if you haven't
already made one.

35:37.594 --> 35:42.765
I know it's asking a lot,
but you're gonna have to trust me, Bo.

35:43.183 --> 35:45.309
"Asking a lot" seems to be

35:45.393 --> 35:48.729
- a bit of an understatement, doesn't it?
- If I were full of shit,

35:49.856 --> 35:51.315
would I be giving you this?

35:55.862 --> 36:00.407
Now, how do I know you're not paying me
with money you stole from me?

36:01.701 --> 36:05.496
You hear about all that oxy
that went missing a few months ago?

36:05.580 --> 36:07.998
I took it from Stan Perkins.

36:08.375 --> 36:10.543
These are the proceeds from its sale.

36:11.127 --> 36:14.880
I got to tell you, Arlo, I'm not sure whether
the things you can do for me

36:14.965 --> 36:17.258
are the things I need done these days.

36:17.592 --> 36:19.301
Come on, Bo.

36:20.095 --> 36:23.347
We both know I'm familiar
with your operation.

36:23.431 --> 36:24.807
Could help you in so many ways.

36:31.439 --> 36:34.483
I think I'm gonna have to think it over
for a while.

36:34.568 --> 36:35.609
I understand.

36:36.778 --> 36:38.487
Why don't we meet back here
tomorrow night

36:38.572 --> 36:40.906
after you've had some time to think about it?

36:43.743 --> 36:45.661
I never meant to do you wrong, Bo.

36:46.496 --> 36:50.040
I may not be smart enough
to run things how you did,

36:50.125 --> 36:55.170
but I didn't ever mean to let you down
or pull something over on you.

36:57.549 --> 37:00.092
Okay, Arlo, we'll see you
tomorrow night, then.

37:00.176 --> 37:02.052
Yep. Tomorrow night.

37:03.346 --> 37:06.223
By the way, Arlo,
can you do me a favor?

37:06.308 --> 37:07.349
What?

37:07.851 --> 37:09.184
You talk to your son.

37:09.603 --> 37:11.979
If he has any sway with his girlfriend,

37:12.731 --> 37:14.648
tell him to get her the hell out of Kentucky.

37:15.191 --> 37:17.610
She came in here and stood
right where you're standing right now

37:17.694 --> 37:19.153
and pointed a shotgun at me.

37:19.529 --> 37:22.698
That ain't good. If I see him, I'll tell him.

37:47.974 --> 37:49.224
Ava.

37:50.769 --> 37:51.894
Ava?

38:02.072 --> 38:03.447
What are you doing?

38:04.157 --> 38:06.951
- Sitting in the dark.
- Point that thing away from me.

38:07.035 --> 38:08.786
You gonna tattle to my parole officer?

38:08.870 --> 38:11.830
You waltz into Johnny's bar
and stick this in Bo's face?

38:11.915 --> 38:13.123
What the hell you thinking?

38:13.500 --> 38:17.169
You are determined to be contrary,
even if it gets you strung up from a tree.

38:17.295 --> 38:18.712
Well, I've had it, Ava. Enough.

38:18.797 --> 38:21.840
I'm not gonna watch you
and Boyd and keep an eye on Arlo, too.

38:21.925 --> 38:23.133
I mean, the hell with it!

38:23.218 --> 38:25.552
You just wish you could keep
your eye on everything, don't you?

38:25.679 --> 38:27.721
I just wish you'd get the hell out
of Kentucky once and for all!

38:27.847 --> 38:29.807
Why? So you can keep screwing your ex?

38:31.643 --> 38:32.851
What?

38:35.563 --> 38:37.564
I was there, Raylan.

38:37.649 --> 38:39.358
- Wait.
- I saw her leave.

38:40.735 --> 38:41.902
Shit.

38:42.737 --> 38:45.072
I didn't think she was that kind of girl.

38:46.866 --> 38:50.744
Tell me something so I know
exactly how cheap I should feel.

38:51.663 --> 38:53.414
Were you screwing her all along?

38:53.748 --> 38:56.500
- You know I wasn't.
- No.

38:57.919 --> 39:00.254
Come right down to it, I don't.

39:07.929 --> 39:10.431
So, what are you gonna do?
Are you gonna sit in that chair

39:10.515 --> 39:12.099
with a shotgun,

39:12.225 --> 39:14.059
kill any man who walks through your door?

39:14.519 --> 39:16.270
I didn't kill you.

39:17.605 --> 39:19.773
Fair point, considering.

39:23.111 --> 39:26.947
I'm just a girl from the holler, Raylan,
for better or worse.

39:27.032 --> 39:29.450
I can be myself here, you know?

39:30.452 --> 39:35.706
And whether I die tomorrow or 10 years
from now, it's gonna be here.

39:36.958 --> 39:38.459
This is home.

39:46.718 --> 39:47.801
TV power.

39:51.139 --> 39:52.890
What's this shit?

39:55.393 --> 39:56.810
Bye, bye, bye.

40:02.650 --> 40:03.734
Hey.

40:03.943 --> 40:04.985
Evening.

40:05.070 --> 40:08.155
- I don't suppose y'all have a jack?
- Hands up!

40:08.323 --> 40:11.075
- You alone?
- Listen, I mean you no trouble.

40:11.159 --> 40:13.410
- Then back off the road right now.
- Tire's blown.

40:13.495 --> 40:15.496
- Key's in the ignition?
- Yeah, but it ain't moving.

40:15.622 --> 40:17.498
Come on, man, get out of here.
Down the road!

40:17.582 --> 40:19.333
Turn around, I'll pop you in the head!

40:21.961 --> 40:24.338
- Fire in the hole.
- Look out!

40:35.934 --> 40:38.268
Now, take their IDs, their phones.

40:38.353 --> 40:39.853
Leave them a little walking money.

40:40.105 --> 40:41.605
Do you have any idea what you just did?

40:46.027 --> 40:48.362
I just spared your lives.

40:48.446 --> 40:51.532
Now, you two better run back from
where you came,

40:51.616 --> 40:54.201
and I wouldn't stop
till I saw something familiar.

40:55.286 --> 40:56.620
Let's go.

41:01.376 --> 41:02.835
You're gonna pay for that!
