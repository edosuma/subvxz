00:01.520 --> 00:04.034
<i>Even though I was</i>
<i>already an amazing doctor,</i>

00:04.120 --> 00:08.238
<i>when I became chief resident, I decided</i>
<i>to add something extra to my repertoire.</i>

00:08.320 --> 00:09.435
<i>A hook, if you will.</i>

00:09.520 --> 00:13.433
Mrs MacCalla, 40s, moderately
attractive, condition improving.

00:13.520 --> 00:16.033
Did you just say
I was moderately attractive?

00:16.120 --> 00:17.758
Excuse me, Mrs MacCalla.

00:17.840 --> 00:21.230
Patient's complaint of hearing loss
was clearly to get attention.

00:21.320 --> 00:24.835
Where'd you get the idea
for the stupid tape recorder?

00:24.920 --> 00:27.718
<i>Dude, I love</i>
<i>your new tape recorder.</i>

00:29.960 --> 00:31.154
You two are idiots.

00:31.240 --> 00:34.550
Come on, Carla, I wanted a hook,
and I only had one other idea.

00:34.640 --> 00:36.995
Mr Hawkins, the results
of your tests are back,

00:37.080 --> 00:39.753
- and you have...
- Liver disease. Liver disease.

00:39.840 --> 00:41.273
Sorry. That's all he can say.

00:41.360 --> 00:44.511
You don't have liver disease.
You have inoperable lung cancer.

00:44.600 --> 00:47.831
- Liver disease.
- If only, Chauncey.

00:47.920 --> 00:50.878
Bottom line, a recorder won't
fly away and break your heart.

00:50.960 --> 00:54.669
Sorry. I'm just a little edgy because
my husband woke me up last night,

00:54.760 --> 00:57.115
and he knows once I'm up
I can't go back to sleep.

00:57.200 --> 00:58.918
Baby, I was quiet last night.

01:04.160 --> 01:06.355
Great, I'm awake.

01:06.440 --> 01:08.431
Sorry about that, sweetness.

01:08.520 --> 01:10.875
Since you're up,
I was wondering if we could...

01:10.960 --> 01:14.316
Are you crazy?
No, Turk. I...

01:19.680 --> 01:22.353
Gesundheit.
<i>I love my new tape recorder.</i>

01:22.440 --> 01:25.273
<i>Not only is it a timesaver,</i>
<i>I can record my every thought.</i>

01:25.360 --> 01:27.237
I like toast.

01:27.320 --> 01:30.437
<i>They aren't all winners.</i>
<i>Still, as long as I have this thing,</i>

01:30.520 --> 01:32.715
<i>I don't need to be</i>
<i>in my head so much.</i>

01:32.800 --> 01:34.199
Excuse me.

01:34.280 --> 01:36.635
<i>Why did I say excuse me?</i>
<i>He bumped into me.</i>

01:36.720 --> 01:38.597
<i>I have to stop doing that.</i>

01:38.680 --> 01:41.319
Excuse me!
<i>Frick!</i>

01:41.400 --> 01:42.719
Got you a blueberry muffin,

01:42.800 --> 01:45.268
but you don't like blueberries,
so I picked 'em out.

01:45.360 --> 01:48.193
<i>People think Molly's off,</i>
<i>but I totally get her.</i>

01:48.280 --> 01:50.350
<i>She's like the big sister</i>
<i>I always wanted.</i>

01:50.440 --> 01:52.271
<i>She makes me feel</i>
<i>better about myself.</i>

01:52.360 --> 01:55.033
They're so not finger toes.
These are finger toes.

01:55.120 --> 01:57.998
- Yours are cute, like French fries.
- Really?

01:58.080 --> 02:01.436
Yeah. I can do calligraphy with mine.

02:01.520 --> 02:02.953
<i>She looks after me.</i>

02:03.040 --> 02:04.473
Sorry, sorry!

02:09.800 --> 02:12.109
<i>She makes me do things</i>
<i>I don't normally do.</i>

02:23.240 --> 02:26.391
<i>She's the Peppermint Patty</i>
<i>to my Marcie.</i>

02:26.480 --> 02:30.189
<i>You know, minus the thick glasses</i>
<i>and the strong lesbian vibe.</i>

02:31.800 --> 02:34.075
Half of what rappers say
doesn't make sense.

02:34.160 --> 02:36.276
Like that Snoop Dogg,
Dr. Dre song.

02:36.360 --> 02:39.636
What does "still hittin' them corners
and those Ho Hos, girl" mean?

02:39.720 --> 02:43.508
Many disadvantaged African-Americans
have limited nutritional choices.

02:43.600 --> 02:46.273
Therefore, they must subsist
on Ho Ho snack cakes.

02:46.360 --> 02:47.952
It's a black thing, bro.

02:48.040 --> 02:51.237
It's, "Still hittin' them corners
in them low-lows, girl."

02:51.320 --> 02:52.594
Low-lows, not Ho Hos.

02:52.680 --> 02:54.955
See, Turk, in the hood,
a low-low is a low rider

02:55.040 --> 02:59.113
or a car with an adjusted suspension
that allows it to bounce up and down.

02:59.200 --> 03:01.156
Dre and Snoop enjoy driving together

03:01.240 --> 03:04.391
in their low riders around the corners,
or lizzle rizzles.

03:13.640 --> 03:17.235
Turk, you just got schooled on rap
by the two whitest chicks in America.

03:17.320 --> 03:20.392
- None of you can prove it.
- I got it on tape.

03:37.040 --> 03:40.919
<i>There's Dr Kelso. OK,</i>
<i>you're chief resident now, so say hi.</i>

03:41.000 --> 03:43.468
<i>Don't stop, or you'll have</i>
<i>to say something,</i>

03:43.560 --> 03:45.551
<i>and you know you</i>
<i>don't improvise well.</i>

03:45.640 --> 03:48.029
- Hi, Dr Kelso.
- Dr Reid.

03:48.120 --> 03:50.588
I see you've trimmed your nose hair.

03:52.160 --> 03:54.230
<i>Frick on a stick!</i>

03:54.320 --> 03:56.515
<i>Molly's nervous cos</i>
<i>her boyfriend's in town.</i>

03:56.600 --> 04:00.388
Mike's private, so when we go to dinner
pretend I never told you personal stuff.

04:00.480 --> 04:02.311
Gotcha.

04:02.400 --> 04:04.675
<i>Mike's got a curved peep.</i>

04:06.840 --> 04:09.479
Watch your step there, little lady.

04:09.560 --> 04:12.279
Thanks, Janitor.
<i>He is so sweet.</i>

04:12.360 --> 04:15.352
<i>But why doesn't he just put up</i>
<i>a sign that says "wet floor"?</i>

04:18.440 --> 04:21.079
Wet floor.

04:21.160 --> 04:24.232
Sorry. I was recording some thoughts
and I slipped and fell.

04:24.320 --> 04:25.309
Give me this.

04:25.400 --> 04:28.437
<i>Possible nicknames for Dr Cox</i>
<i>when we become best friends:</i>

04:28.520 --> 04:30.750
<i>The Coxinator, Cox of Seagulls.</i>

04:31.600 --> 04:35.479
<i>Here it comes. Another condescending</i>
<i>rant about how we suck at ourjobs.</i>

04:35.560 --> 04:37.630
Since you two have
become chief residents,

04:37.720 --> 04:41.554
I've noticed your leadership skills
are... How can I put this delicately?

04:41.640 --> 04:42.629
...crap!

04:42.720 --> 04:44.358
- Oh, sir...
- That is so not nice.

04:44.440 --> 04:46.158
Some people say I'm a good leader.

04:46.240 --> 04:49.755
Why don't you go and get that
young resident there to come up here?

04:49.840 --> 04:51.796
- Easy. Lonnie?
- Not right now.

04:54.000 --> 04:55.194
Yes, sir?

04:55.280 --> 04:58.590
Slap yourself very hard
in the face then leave.

04:59.520 --> 05:03.957
Anyway, one of you two is going
to speak at Grand Rounds today.

05:04.040 --> 05:08.033
<i>Here comes the part where he throws me</i>
<i>to the wolves to protect his protégé.</i>

05:09.920 --> 05:11.399
Barbie, you're up.

05:11.480 --> 05:12.833
<i>Perfect.</i>

05:16.520 --> 05:19.398
Our TV's working.
Why are you reading?

05:19.480 --> 05:22.313
I'm researching leadership
techniques for my residents.

05:22.400 --> 05:24.914
You're better off
watching good ol' Papa Smurf.

05:25.000 --> 05:27.958
Yeah. He says leadership
boils down to three things:

05:28.040 --> 05:31.430
Smurfaration,
smurfaration, smurf.

05:31.520 --> 05:33.750
Preparation,
inspiration and fear?

05:33.840 --> 05:35.114
You know it.

05:36.400 --> 05:38.550
Are we playing pillow feet again?

05:38.640 --> 05:40.756
I'm not waking Carla tonight.

05:49.480 --> 05:50.799
Turk.

05:50.880 --> 05:52.711
I'm sorry, baby.

05:52.800 --> 05:55.394
- So you're definitely up now, huh?
- Yes.

05:58.440 --> 06:02.194
That's it. From now on, you and I
are going to bed at the same time.

06:02.280 --> 06:05.750
That's fine. You know what, baby?
Since you're up, I was wondering...

06:05.840 --> 06:08.513
No, Turk! I can't
believe that you...

06:17.880 --> 06:19.154
<i>Oh, my God!</i>

06:19.240 --> 06:21.435
<i>How does she eat like that</i>
<i>and stay so thin?</i>

06:21.520 --> 06:24.512
<i>If I didn't love her,</i>
<i>I'd spread rumours that she's bulimic.</i>

06:24.600 --> 06:25.999
So how's it going?

06:26.080 --> 06:29.311
I'm freaking out about Grand Rounds.
Cox hung me out to dry again.

06:29.400 --> 06:32.358
You'll be fine. Just do what I do,
fake it till you make it.

06:32.440 --> 06:35.238
Like when a guy's bad in bed,
and you pretend he's awesome

06:35.320 --> 06:37.834
so he doesn't go to a special store,
buy a weird pump

06:37.920 --> 06:40.434
- and accidentally run into your dad?
- Kind of.

06:40.520 --> 06:42.158
See Dr Kelso there?

06:42.240 --> 06:45.676
I have to justify my programme
for our psychotic homeless population.

06:45.760 --> 06:48.274
Am I scared to go over
to his table of stuffy fat guys

06:48.360 --> 06:50.828
cos I know they're
just gonna stare at my chest?

06:50.920 --> 06:54.117
Of course. But...

06:54.200 --> 06:57.988
...l'm just gonna act confident,
and they're gonna believe I'm confident.

06:58.880 --> 07:00.279
<i>Wow.</i>

07:00.360 --> 07:03.796
Excuse me.
Yep, those are my boobs.

07:03.880 --> 07:06.155
Have you had time
to go over my proposal?

07:06.240 --> 07:08.754
Yes. Medical care
for crazy homeless people.

07:08.840 --> 07:11.559
- Sounds like a money-maker.
- You know it's a good idea.

07:11.640 --> 07:14.871
<i>As I watched Molly shielding</i>
<i>her boobs and working her magic,</i>

07:14.960 --> 07:16.837
<i>I realised she wasn't just my friend.</i>

07:16.920 --> 07:20.310
<i>She's the mentor</i>
<i>I've always been looking for.</i>

07:22.880 --> 07:25.348
Check out my man
getting his leadership on.

07:25.440 --> 07:27.590
First he hits 'em
with a little preparation.

07:27.680 --> 07:30.069
Questions about
evolving treatment therapies?

07:30.160 --> 07:32.196
Next, inspiration.

07:32.280 --> 07:35.829
You guys all have the potential
to be amazing doctors.

07:35.920 --> 07:37.512
And finally, a dose of fear.

07:37.600 --> 07:39.591
OK. I'll see you guys.

07:42.360 --> 07:45.272
Fear might need a little work,
but otherwise, smurftastic!

07:45.360 --> 07:48.158
- That's how I smurf, baby.
- Mmm, Smurfette.

07:48.240 --> 07:50.800
Blue boobies.

07:55.520 --> 07:59.229
- Who wants another beer?
- Turk, it's bedtime.

08:00.760 --> 08:04.435
Baby, when you said
we'd go to sleep at the same time,

08:04.520 --> 08:07.318
I thought you meant
you'd stay up until I went to sleep.

08:07.400 --> 08:10.039
Turk, that's crazy talk.

08:10.120 --> 08:13.430
But the guys are here,
and it's the ninth inning.

08:15.120 --> 08:17.634
Gentlemen, a moment
for our fallen comrade.

08:24.840 --> 08:27.798
How old is this patient?

08:27.880 --> 08:29.996
Seventy-nine.

08:30.080 --> 08:33.833
And how old would you say he was
when you started this procedure?

08:33.919 --> 08:36.354
<i>The more I thought</i>
<i>about how awesome Molly is,</i>

08:36.440 --> 08:38.236
<i>the more I got sick of Dr Cox's crap.</i>

08:38.320 --> 08:39.832
Oh, my God.
I could fly to China,

08:39.919 --> 08:42.558
adopt a child, raise her
and send her to medical school

08:42.640 --> 08:46.315
and then train her to do this procedure
in the time it's taken you to finish it.

08:46.400 --> 08:48.550
<i>Enough!</i>
<i>He's never been there for you.</i>

08:48.640 --> 08:51.074
<i>Burn this bridge once and for all.</i>

08:51.160 --> 08:53.833
- Barbie, honest to God...
- You know what, Dr Cox?

08:53.920 --> 08:56.753
I have so had it with this
whole macho alpha-male thing,

08:56.840 --> 09:00.230
and I have heard every tired,
recycled putdown you have in you.

09:00.320 --> 09:03.118
Save your stupid lessons
for someone who gives a frick,

09:03.200 --> 09:06.112
because I don't want to see you
or that stupid poodle perm

09:06.200 --> 09:08.760
unless it's walkin' away from me.

09:08.840 --> 09:11.035
<i>God, that felt great!</i>

09:11.120 --> 09:14.317
<i>Hopefully, it won't have</i>
<i>ramifications for anyone else.</i>

09:14.400 --> 09:17.039
<i>I'm feeling so good today</i>

09:19.520 --> 09:23.274
<i>I still feel good</i>
<i>cos nobody saw me fall</i>

09:24.880 --> 09:27.553
That sound you're hearing
is my residents' respect.

09:27.640 --> 09:29.915
- It feels good.
- Gloria!

09:30.000 --> 09:33.595
You were supposed to start
pre-rounds at 7.00. It's now 7.03.

09:33.680 --> 09:35.716
Sorry I'm late.
I was singing, and I fell.

09:35.800 --> 09:39.031
I know I've used the falling excuse
before, but it happened again.

09:39.120 --> 09:41.554
I know the only thing
you've been responsible for

09:41.640 --> 09:43.596
was picking which
Duran Duran cover band

09:43.680 --> 09:46.831
would play at your sorority formal,
but you're supposed to teach.

09:46.920 --> 09:48.638
So how's about
you learn how to walk,

09:48.720 --> 09:52.349
ditch the tape recorder
and act like you got a pair!

09:54.480 --> 09:56.471
Kill Lonnie.

09:59.400 --> 10:02.073
<i>I felt great</i>
<i>after telling Dr Cox off. Why?</i>

10:02.160 --> 10:04.355
<i>Because I knew I had</i>
<i>someone to support me,</i>

10:04.440 --> 10:08.069
<i>someone to look up to,</i>
<i>someone pretty amazing.</i>

10:12.480 --> 10:13.833
Wow!

10:13.920 --> 10:16.115
That outfit would look
better on my floor.

10:16.200 --> 10:18.634
Mistake.

10:19.720 --> 10:22.109
No! Not the Lasso of Truth!

10:23.520 --> 10:26.671
I once had a threesome,
and not the cool kind.

10:29.360 --> 10:32.238
- We gotta do dinner another night.
- How come?

10:32.320 --> 10:35.118
Mike got up and wanted to read
the paper, and I don't get it.

10:35.200 --> 10:37.555
He went to the neighbour's,
and they don't get it.

10:37.640 --> 10:41.110
He broke into their garage, stole
their car and wrapped it around a pole.

10:41.200 --> 10:43.873
- Oh, my God! Is he OK?
- I've been better.

10:43.960 --> 10:46.428
Oh, sorry.
Mike, Elliot. Elliot, Mike.

10:46.520 --> 10:50.115
- Great.
- I'll be right in.

10:51.920 --> 10:52.989
Elliot, I'm sorry.

10:53.080 --> 10:55.833
I know all about how it is
when you think a guy's great

10:55.920 --> 10:57.273
and he ends up a car thief.

10:57.360 --> 11:00.511
Relationships are never perfect,
and Mike's got potential.

11:00.600 --> 11:03.034
He's got the most beautiful eyes
I've ever seen.

11:03.120 --> 11:05.475
<i>My God,</i>
<i>my mentor's a crazy person.</i>

11:05.560 --> 11:06.834
- Molly!
- Coming, babe.

11:06.920 --> 11:09.593
- So, rain check on the dinner.
- Yeah.

11:10.680 --> 11:11.954
<i>Watching Molly,</i>

11:12.040 --> 11:15.476
<i>I found myself asking</i>
<i>the same questions I always do.</i>

11:15.560 --> 11:17.710
<i>Did I line up</i>
<i>behind the wrong person?</i>

11:17.800 --> 11:20.519
<i>Am I too much of a wimp?</i>

11:20.600 --> 11:23.034
Oh, my God! What a catch!

11:26.120 --> 11:28.588
<i>Will people around here</i>
<i>ever respect me?</i>

11:28.680 --> 11:29.795
Guys.

11:29.880 --> 11:32.394
Guys. Guys!

11:34.000 --> 11:36.514
<i>Unfortunately,</i>
<i>I closed the door on the creep</i>

11:36.600 --> 11:38.750
<i>who used to occasionally</i>
<i>give me answers.</i>

11:38.840 --> 11:41.308
<i>I just had to hope</i>
<i>that I hadn't closed it for good.</i>

11:41.400 --> 11:44.278
Dr Cox, do you have a sec?

11:52.200 --> 11:54.270
It's gonna be OK, sweetie.

11:54.360 --> 11:57.670
<i>As I watched Molly gently stroke</i>
<i>the hand of a convicted felon,</i>

11:57.760 --> 12:00.069
<i>I had to admit,</i>
<i>his eyes were stunning.</i>

12:00.160 --> 12:03.311
<i>I couldn't help but think what</i>
<i>the next few years would be like</i>

12:03.400 --> 12:04.515
<i>if she was my mentor.</i>

12:04.600 --> 12:07.068
The police caught this guy
robbing a liquor store,

12:07.160 --> 12:10.038
tox screen is positive
for methamphetamines and cocaine.

12:10.120 --> 12:13.908
- OK, what should I do?
- Make out with him. He's such a catch.

12:17.880 --> 12:20.235
Hi. I'm Dr Reid.

12:29.240 --> 12:30.832
What's up?

12:30.920 --> 12:33.195
Dr Cox went ballistic
in front of my residents.

12:33.280 --> 12:35.475
Now I've lost my mojo.
Check this out.

12:37.000 --> 12:38.797
- Hey, JD.
- You see? There's no fear.

12:38.880 --> 12:41.394
- Can you help a brother out?
- I have my own problems.

12:41.480 --> 12:44.233
I've got a bedtime again.
I haven't had one in 12 years.

12:44.320 --> 12:46.914
- You had a bedtime when you were 17?
- Not every night.

12:47.000 --> 12:49.673
On weekends, I didn't have
to be in bed, just in my room.

12:49.760 --> 12:51.159
That's way cooler.

12:51.240 --> 12:55.153
Carla's setting a record on being
a pain in the ass, and I can't help you.

12:55.240 --> 12:58.118
<i>Carla's setting a record</i>
<i>on being a major pain in the ass,</i>

12:58.200 --> 12:59.235
<i>and I can't help you.</i>

12:59.320 --> 13:02.790
OK, here's what you do.

13:04.840 --> 13:06.796
<i>OK, you can't</i>
<i>bend that way anymore,</i>

13:06.880 --> 13:09.189
<i>cos when you do,</i>
<i>that last vertebrae sticks out</i>

13:09.280 --> 13:11.475
<i>and makes you look</i>
<i>like a prehistoric camel.</i>

13:11.560 --> 13:15.075
- What are you thinking?
- Same ol', same ol'.

13:15.160 --> 13:17.310
- Camel butt?
- Yeah.

13:17.400 --> 13:18.549
Can you warn everyone

13:18.640 --> 13:21.632
that Mike gets a little handsy
when he's on the painkillers?

13:21.720 --> 13:25.759
- Dr Vaji already told us.
- It was horrible.

13:26.520 --> 13:28.317
Elliot, want to grab some lunch?

13:28.400 --> 13:31.278
Oh, I'm sorry, I can't.
I'm busy.

13:31.360 --> 13:33.271
OK.

13:33.360 --> 13:36.875
<i>I felt bad, but it was time</i>
<i>to start pulling away.</i>

13:38.040 --> 13:39.632
- Dr Cox.
- Hold on.

13:39.720 --> 13:42.951
Bob, did you happen to order
any of the pain in the ass?

13:43.040 --> 13:45.315
- No.
- We didn't order the pain in the ass.

13:45.400 --> 13:47.960
- You yelled in front of my residents.
- I didn't.

13:48.040 --> 13:49.473
<i>So how's about you learn to walk,</i>

13:49.560 --> 13:51.790
<i>ditch the tape recorder</i>
<i>and act like you got a pair!</i>

13:51.880 --> 13:53.029
I'll let you two talk.

13:53.120 --> 13:56.874
Perry, I'd be remiss if I didn't tell
you that earlier I wish I'd said,

13:56.960 --> 14:00.396
"I must've ordered the pain
in the ass seeing as you're there."

14:00.480 --> 14:03.711
Here I was thinking the same thing.
Let's do this again.

14:03.800 --> 14:05.313
Tell you what there, Gidget,

14:05.400 --> 14:08.153
if you promise to leave right now,
I won't yell at you

14:08.240 --> 14:11.312
- in front of your peons anymore.
- You ruined my credibility!

14:11.400 --> 14:14.119
Look me in the eyes and tell me
that's not messed up.

14:14.200 --> 14:15.189
Fair enough.

14:15.280 --> 14:18.397
Later when you're with residents,
I'll come up for something.

14:18.480 --> 14:20.596
You'll tell me
you're too busy in a manly way,

14:20.680 --> 14:22.796
and I'll contritely turn around
and walk out

14:22.880 --> 14:25.075
with my tail between my legs.
Problem solved.

14:25.160 --> 14:27.469
- Can you pull off contrite?
- Can you pull off manly way?

14:27.560 --> 14:29.391
Should've seen that coming.

14:29.480 --> 14:31.869
Turk, would you pour me
a cup of decaf, please?

14:31.960 --> 14:35.748
- We gotta go to bed early tonight.
- I'll have some of that decaf, son.

14:35.840 --> 14:39.549
No, sir. See, this is regular.
I gotta give Carla the strong stuff

14:39.640 --> 14:41.835
just to keep her awake
so I can stay up later.

14:41.920 --> 14:46.277
Drugging your own wife.
Been there. Careful, though.

14:46.360 --> 14:48.430
Starts with coffee.
Next thing you know,

14:48.520 --> 14:52.718
you're rooting around for an adrenaline
shot to counteract a Valium overdose.

14:57.120 --> 15:00.237
- Your coffee, my love.
- Thank you, my husband.

15:02.120 --> 15:04.270
What a fun day.

15:08.920 --> 15:12.674
Hey, camel butt.
I heard you and Carla talking.

15:12.800 --> 15:15.394
<i>Frick on a stick with a brick!</i>
<i>Just leave.</i>

15:15.480 --> 15:17.277
Oh, whoa now.

15:17.360 --> 15:20.158
What happened to...
what happened to feisty Barbie?

15:20.240 --> 15:22.435
You know, it took me
a hell of a lot to shake off

15:22.520 --> 15:24.636
that tongue-lashing
you gave me yesterday.

15:24.720 --> 15:27.439
Yesterday I had a mentor,
but she turned out to be insane.

15:27.520 --> 15:29.715
How am I supposed to take
professional advice

15:29.800 --> 15:32.678
from somebody who can't
hold together their personal life?

15:32.760 --> 15:34.910
I know you and I
have never really connected.

15:35.000 --> 15:37.594
Maybe that's because
you're relentlessly annoying,

15:37.680 --> 15:39.910
or maybe it's my fault
because I can't tolerate

15:40.000 --> 15:42.309
relentlessly annoying people.
I don't know.

15:42.400 --> 15:45.392
But answer me one question.
Do you think I'm a good teacher?

15:46.280 --> 15:47.838
- To some people.
- Fair enough.

15:47.920 --> 15:50.718
Why don't we go ahead and
take a look at my personal life?

15:50.800 --> 15:52.791
I am in love with a woman that I hate,

15:52.880 --> 15:55.314
my two-year-old son
calls me Pewwy,

15:55.400 --> 15:59.279
and this is something that I've never
actually shared with anybody before,

15:59.360 --> 16:03.751
but on Saturday nights, I like to throw
on a nice dress, go out to dive bars

16:03.840 --> 16:06.718
and insist that everybody
call me Mrs Haberdasher.

16:08.120 --> 16:09.348
No, you don't.

16:09.440 --> 16:11.396
Even if I did,
it wouldn't really matter

16:11.480 --> 16:14.313
since that has nothing to do
with how good of a teacher I am.

16:14.400 --> 16:18.109
Stick with me here, Barbie. The point is
that if you've found somebody

16:18.200 --> 16:21.795
who makes you believe in yourself
as much as you did yesterday, well...

16:21.880 --> 16:24.678
...I would think twice
before I wrote that person off.

16:27.760 --> 16:29.751
OK, everybody,
gather around, please.

16:30.760 --> 16:32.796
Newbie, I need to talk to you.

16:32.880 --> 16:34.836
I'm a little busy right now, Perry.

16:34.920 --> 16:38.754
Oh. My fault.
I'll come back later.

16:40.040 --> 16:41.758
Oh, and another thing.

16:41.840 --> 16:45.628
From now on, I'd prefer it if
you'd address me as Dr Dorian.

16:45.720 --> 16:48.917
- Are you really doing this?
- You bet your ass I am.

16:49.000 --> 16:51.275
And from now on,
if you have a problem with me,

16:51.360 --> 16:53.874
you come see me in private,
not in front of my boys.

16:53.960 --> 16:55.791
My boys got enough to worry about.

16:55.880 --> 16:57.108
Wrap it up there, Bingo.

16:57.200 --> 17:01.432
I simply will not tolerate it, Perry!
And neither will my boys.

17:01.520 --> 17:05.957
The next minute you find
yourself alone, I'm gonna kill you.

17:06.040 --> 17:08.679
It was worth it.

17:10.680 --> 17:13.147
Lonnie, slap the face.

17:13.240 --> 17:14.958
All of you, slap your faces.

17:16.280 --> 17:17.872
Awesome.

17:27.480 --> 17:29.038
It's morning already?

17:29.120 --> 17:30.997
No, but I could see
how you think that,

17:31.080 --> 17:33.275
being that it's light out
and we're in bed.

17:33.360 --> 17:35.669
Baby, since we've got married,

17:35.760 --> 17:38.354
I've done every little thing
you've asked me to do.

17:38.440 --> 17:40.590
But I will not
have my woman tell me

17:40.680 --> 17:43.114
when I need to go to bed, OK?

17:43.200 --> 17:45.270
- OK.
- Really? That quick?

17:45.360 --> 17:49.353
I love it when you're all,
"My woman this, my woman that."

17:49.440 --> 17:51.795
That's what I thought.

17:53.320 --> 17:55.550
Good night.

17:58.960 --> 18:00.359
Can we leave the lights on?

18:00.440 --> 18:01.919
- Oh, yeah.
- Oh, yeah.

18:02.000 --> 18:04.116
Oh, yeah.

18:07.320 --> 18:11.757
Hey, Molly? I was wondering
if I could get your advice,

18:11.840 --> 18:13.432
if you're not too busy with Mike.

18:13.520 --> 18:15.829
Actually, we decided
to take a little break.

18:15.920 --> 18:18.229
- How long?
- Two to five years.

18:20.840 --> 18:23.229
I freaked you out a little bit
with him, didn't I?

18:23.320 --> 18:24.912
I try not to judge.

18:25.000 --> 18:26.991
I know I should know better.
I'm a shrink.

18:27.080 --> 18:29.833
But show me a guy who wants
to get married and has a good job,

18:29.920 --> 18:31.399
and it's snoozeville for me.

18:31.480 --> 18:34.040
But if you know a 35-year-old
who still lives at home

18:34.120 --> 18:36.156
and he still thinks
his band can make it,

18:36.240 --> 18:38.834
tell me where to meet him
so I can buy him dinner.

18:38.920 --> 18:40.638
<i>Listening to Molly</i>
<i>made me realise</i>

18:40.720 --> 18:43.996
<i>a person doesn't have to be perfect</i>
<i>to be exactly what you need.</i>

18:44.080 --> 18:47.868
Yeah. I've dated
some pretty immature guys too.

18:49.640 --> 18:53.110
Hello, tiny ladies.
I don't believe we've met.

18:53.200 --> 18:57.432
I'm the world's most giant doctor.
Nice to...

18:57.520 --> 19:00.671
<i>As I watched Elliot and Molly walk off</i>
<i>and thought about how Lonnie</i>

19:00.760 --> 19:03.513
<i>was a much less stable</i>
<i>giant doctor base than Turk,</i>

19:03.600 --> 19:05.158
<i>I realised how important it is</i>

19:05.240 --> 19:07.708
<i>to have someone close to you</i>
<i>that you can count on.</i>

19:11.320 --> 19:14.118
Lonnie! Damn you!

19:14.200 --> 19:17.909
<i>Especially if that someone is a resident</i>
<i>that can keep Dr Cox from killing you.</i>

19:18.000 --> 19:21.276
Not in front of my boys.
This is Lonnie. He's one of my boys.

19:25.160 --> 19:27.833
Not sure what that means.
See you later.

19:27.920 --> 19:31.230
<i>Sometimes you have to keep</i>
<i>people closer than you'd like.</i>

19:31.320 --> 19:33.072
That was too easy.

19:35.080 --> 19:38.152
No way I'm doing that
seven nights a week.

19:41.840 --> 19:45.913
<i>In my case, it was best</i>
<i>just to keep my distance.</i>

19:46.000 --> 19:49.436
May I have a word with you? Go.

19:51.080 --> 19:53.753
<i>I wonder if we're going</i>
<i>to a happy place.</i>
