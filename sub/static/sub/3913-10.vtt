00:00.046 --> 00:02.277
Previously, on <i>Defiance...</i>

00:02.312 --> 00:05.614
Why would Amanda Rosewater
honor my husband?

00:05.616 --> 00:08.283
Your husband Datak
died a hero.

00:08.285 --> 00:11.286
He walked
into Rahm Tak's camp

00:11.288 --> 00:14.756
with a device implanted
in his forearm.

00:14.792 --> 00:16.123
Oh, shit.

00:21.382 --> 00:23.298
You're going to
help me hunt.

00:23.300 --> 00:24.967
What is that?

00:25.019 --> 00:29.271
A control stem.
It keeps you shapetakers docile.

00:31.892 --> 00:34.193
Enough!

00:34.228 --> 00:35.777
You are forbidden
to feed.

00:35.813 --> 00:38.947
Why? Indogene were created
for that very purpose.

00:42.069 --> 00:44.736
Good-bye, Kindzi.

00:44.788 --> 00:49.791
You will sleep with your family
until you learn your place.

00:50.794 --> 00:52.294
I made a mistake.

00:56.166 --> 00:57.332
No!

00:59.470 --> 01:01.420
No!

01:01.472 --> 01:03.171
People died.

01:06.143 --> 01:08.093
Take a couple of hours,
get your head on straight.

01:08.145 --> 01:10.012
You saying I can't
do the job?

01:12.983 --> 01:17.903
He was weak.
You need to be strong, soldier.

01:17.938 --> 01:19.521
You hear me?

01:26.196 --> 01:28.196
We're trapped.

01:28.198 --> 01:30.282
All right, let's do this.
Butch and Sundance.

01:30.334 --> 01:31.700
Nolan...

01:31.702 --> 01:33.689

01:35.539 --> 01:37.873
Please don't shoot!
It wasn't his fault.

01:37.925 --> 01:39.207
Live or die together!

01:39.260 --> 01:40.208
No!

01:40.261 --> 01:41.199

The grieving Widow Tarr.
Look at her.

02:06.370 --> 02:08.152
What does she want
with the Omec?

02:08.205 --> 02:09.571
What's she after?

02:09.573 --> 02:11.290
Good question.

02:11.325 --> 02:13.542
The woman's a traitor.
She deserves to die.

02:13.577 --> 02:17.579
Yeah, but we did that deal
with her husband.

02:17.581 --> 02:20.749
Don't care.

02:25.089 --> 02:31.259
Thank you for convincing me
to leave my house.

02:31.261 --> 02:32.978
It was a kindness.

02:33.013 --> 02:38.150
I had business in town.
I wanted to see how you were.

02:38.185 --> 02:41.403
There was nothing left
of my husband to bury.

02:41.438 --> 02:45.107
That is how I am.

02:45.159 --> 02:50.445
I am sorry.
I am not good company right now.

02:50.447 --> 02:52.781
It is understandable.

02:52.833 --> 02:55.450
Have you seen your son?

02:55.452 --> 02:57.753

03:47.971 --> 03:50.005
Oh.

03:50.057 --> 03:53.392
Surely you didn't come all
this way just to buy me flowers.

03:53.427 --> 03:55.844
No, I did not.

03:55.896 --> 03:58.430
<i>The Tsuroz</i> is almost
refueled.

03:58.482 --> 04:01.850
It is time for me to consider
what will happen next.

04:01.852 --> 04:03.185
You will wake your people.

04:03.187 --> 04:05.270
Of course.

04:05.322 --> 04:08.690
And then what exactly?

04:08.742 --> 04:11.693
I cannot risk releasing them
among the people of Earth,

04:11.745 --> 04:13.361
not at first.

04:13.414 --> 04:18.200
The rash actions of Kindzi
has made that abundantly clear.

04:18.202 --> 04:21.086
Where is exactly is Kindzi?

04:21.120 --> 04:22.921
I do not wish
to discuss it.

04:22.956 --> 04:28.593
Oh. Tell me this at least.
Am I in any danger?

04:28.629 --> 04:33.632
Kindzi is in no position
to hurt you or anyone else.

04:40.274 --> 04:42.974
Irisa, where's Nolan?

04:43.026 --> 04:44.893
He didn't come home
last night.

04:44.895 --> 04:48.396
We have a situation.

04:48.398 --> 04:52.234
There is a large island
that is called Australia.

04:52.286 --> 04:55.620
It is remote
and uninhabited.

04:55.656 --> 04:59.458
A place where the Omec
would be isolated.

04:59.493 --> 05:03.995
Earth is a complicated planet.
When my children awake,

05:04.047 --> 05:07.082
their first steps
will be unstable.

05:07.134 --> 05:10.802
I cannot allow them to stumble
as Kindzi did.

05:10.838 --> 05:14.306
They will need time,
as all children do.

05:14.341 --> 05:16.808
They will need guidance
as all children do.

05:16.844 --> 05:19.561
Fortunately, they have
a noble and wise father.

05:19.596 --> 05:22.597
Yet no mother.

05:22.649 --> 05:24.599
Come with us.

05:24.651 --> 05:26.601
Prove to my people
that the Omec can

05:26.653 --> 05:31.523
at long last live side-by-side
with Votans, as equals.

05:31.575 --> 05:34.910
The past need not define
the present.

05:37.948 --> 05:43.251
You do me great honor...
but my home is here.

05:43.287 --> 05:47.539
Here? Among people
that call you traitor?

05:47.591 --> 05:49.875
Your husband, it is dead.

05:49.927 --> 05:54.546
You must at long last
stop grieving and move forward.

05:55.933 --> 06:00.218
But my son and grandchild
are here and very much alive.

06:00.270 --> 06:01.603
Bring them along.

06:01.638 --> 06:07.809
I promise you, we will treat
them as equals, as family.

06:07.811 --> 06:11.947
Tell me you will
consider it.

06:11.982 --> 06:14.950
I will.

06:20.791 --> 06:23.241
Mmm.

06:23.293 --> 06:24.659
Nolan.

06:26.663 --> 06:28.997
Where have you been?

06:29.049 --> 06:30.165
Patrolling.

06:30.167 --> 06:33.335
You didn't answer
your hailer.

06:33.387 --> 06:35.253
What's with the getup?

06:35.305 --> 06:36.972
The Votanis Collective
is here.

06:37.007 --> 06:39.007
What?

07:06.036 --> 07:08.920
They radioed from Bissel Pass
about 30 minutes ago,

07:08.956 --> 07:10.288
requesting permission
to enter.

07:10.340 --> 07:11.373
And you said yes?

07:11.425 --> 07:12.958
Yeah, with the stasis nets
destroyed,

07:13.010 --> 07:14.292
it's not like we had
much choice.

07:21.051 --> 07:23.885
Keep smiling.
Hands off the gun.

07:23.887 --> 07:25.303
They say they just want
to talk.

07:36.733 --> 07:38.783
Mayor Rosewater
I take it?

07:38.819 --> 07:40.318
Vice Chancellor Voske.

07:42.239 --> 07:44.406
Please, I get enough
of the Vice Chancellor bit

07:44.408 --> 07:46.041
in Brazil.
Call me Silora.

07:46.076 --> 07:48.877
Very well, Silora.
You can call me Amanda.

07:48.912 --> 07:50.161
And this is my lawkeeper.

07:50.213 --> 07:54.416
Ah, Joshua Nolan, yes,
I know by reputation only.

07:54.468 --> 07:56.301
This is Sturuje,
my Chief of Staff.

07:56.336 --> 07:57.502

07:57.554 --> 07:59.471
And I trust
our traveling companion

07:59.506 --> 08:02.057
requires no introduction.

08:08.598 --> 08:13.435

you're surprised to see me.

me, the Votanis Collective,
and Datak Tarr.

08:56.613 --> 08:59.614
The big question is why?

08:59.649 --> 09:01.232
I have been authorized
to negotiate

09:01.284 --> 09:03.651
a strategic alliance
with Defiance.

09:03.653 --> 09:05.620
Oh, wow.

09:05.655 --> 09:08.990
I-I'm sorry, Silora,
I'm a little bit confused.

09:08.992 --> 09:12.410
Your army has been murdering
our citizens the last few weeks.

09:12.462 --> 09:14.662
Your spies sabotaged us.

09:14.715 --> 09:16.247
They brought down
the St. Louis Arch.

09:16.299 --> 09:17.799
Under duress.

09:17.834 --> 09:20.085
You have blood
on your hands.

09:20.137 --> 09:26.474
My God, you don't know, do you?
Rahm Tak was rogue.

09:26.510 --> 09:28.560
You were never at war
with the Collective,

09:28.595 --> 09:30.845
but with a madman
on a genocidal crusade

09:30.897 --> 09:32.814
to cleanse the Earth
of her rightful inhabitants.

09:32.849 --> 09:37.519
My dear human,
we have come to apologize.

09:37.571 --> 09:39.571
Apologize?

09:39.606 --> 09:41.573
The Collective would like
to help us usher in

09:41.608 --> 09:42.991
a new era of friendship.

09:43.026 --> 09:46.745
12 guards total. 2 in the room,
3 on the doors downstairs,

09:46.780 --> 09:48.246
leaves 7 at the trucks.

09:48.281 --> 09:51.366
So, let us all
drink to peace.

09:51.368 --> 09:53.668
I'm sorry,
why is he here?

09:53.703 --> 09:56.704
We found him in the ruins of
General Rahm Tak's encampment,

09:56.757 --> 09:59.541
grievously injured.
We provided medical care

09:59.593 --> 10:01.760
and gifted him
with a biomechanical arm.

10:03.130 --> 10:06.464
He gave us the impression
you would be pleased to see him.

10:06.516 --> 10:08.850
Well, I had every reason to expect
a warm reception,

10:08.885 --> 10:11.936
given that I almost died
saving this town.

10:11.972 --> 10:13.888
Almost.

10:13.890 --> 10:16.724
The fact you didn't makes me wonder
what game you're playing...

10:16.777 --> 10:18.193
what game they're playing.

10:18.228 --> 10:20.445
Nolan, dial it down.

10:20.480 --> 10:22.697
My lawkeeper is
suspicious by nature.

10:22.732 --> 10:25.033
Damn right
I'm suspicious.

10:25.068 --> 10:28.570
Datak Tarr comes waltzing
in here all fat and sassy

10:28.622 --> 10:30.071
with his <i>haint</i> friends,
expecting...

10:30.123 --> 10:33.208
Watch your mouth, Butcher.
Watch your mouth.

10:33.243 --> 10:37.545
Nolan!
Leave, now.

10:41.384 --> 10:43.968
Nolan?

10:44.004 --> 10:45.086
I say good riddance.

10:45.138 --> 10:48.006
You too, Datak.
Grown-ups need to talk.

10:48.058 --> 10:51.226
You're dismissing me?
Like some handmaiden?

10:51.261 --> 10:53.895
Go home and relax.
Pleasure your wife.

10:53.930 --> 10:56.231
Give some thought as to how
you intend to pay me back

10:56.266 --> 10:58.600
for that extremely expensive arm
you have acquired

10:58.602 --> 11:02.604
under false pretenses.

11:02.656 --> 11:07.025
Of course, Vice Chancellor.
Thank you for your time.

11:10.699 --> 11:12.914
_

11:12.949 --> 11:14.332
Right now, I'm looking
for someone

11:14.367 --> 11:17.785
upon whom I can vent my rage.
Are you volunteering?

11:17.787 --> 11:20.171
Are you?

11:20.207 --> 11:22.423
No, Favi Tarr.

11:22.459 --> 11:25.460
Well, I best keep up
the search then.

11:26.996 --> 11:28.269
_

11:28.849 --> 11:32.133
Rahm Tak was originally
sent out on a scouting mission

11:32.135 --> 11:35.019
with a dozen other divisions
after Belize and New York fell.

11:35.055 --> 11:37.939
His orders were
to collect data

11:37.974 --> 11:41.309
and to provide aid and comfort
to survivors.

11:41.361 --> 11:42.810
And you expect me
to believe

11:42.812 --> 11:44.812
that you had no idea
what he was capable of?

11:44.865 --> 11:46.314
They said he was
above reproach.

11:46.316 --> 11:49.284
He was married
to Vizier Quando's niece.

11:49.319 --> 11:52.537
I, uh...

11:52.572 --> 11:57.075
I sent her in
to talk sense to him.

11:57.127 --> 11:59.160
Do you know what
that <i>vekihabolo</i> did?

11:59.212 --> 12:01.329
Mm-mmm.

12:01.381 --> 12:05.083
He sent us back her head mounted
on the front of her motorcycle.

12:05.135 --> 12:07.001
We were planning
to take him out by force,

12:07.003 --> 12:09.170
but you people beat us
to the punch.

12:09.222 --> 12:11.139
You solved
our embarrassing problem,

12:11.174 --> 12:13.007
and the V.C.
owes you one.

12:15.845 --> 12:17.979
Oh, I thought the Datak thing
would go over better,

12:18.014 --> 12:19.731
honestly, I did.

12:19.766 --> 12:21.316
That conniving little <i>haint.</i>

12:21.351 --> 12:22.317
Silora.

12:22.352 --> 12:24.652
It's okay when I say it.

12:24.688 --> 12:27.906
Anyway, that brings us
to the present.

12:27.941 --> 12:32.994
Vizier Quando has authorized me
to offer you the works...

12:33.029 --> 12:35.363
gulanite trade agreement,
mutual defense pact,

12:35.415 --> 12:38.833
ambassador exchange,
you know, blah, blah, blah.

12:38.868 --> 12:41.669
And what do you want
in return?

12:41.705 --> 12:43.338
There's no such thing
as a free lunch.

12:43.373 --> 12:46.007
There are those
among my people

12:46.042 --> 12:49.177
who celebrate Rahm Tak
and his atrocities.

12:49.212 --> 12:52.263
Unfortunately, he's become
somewhat of a folk hero,

12:52.299 --> 12:54.599
and fighting that perception
is an uphill battle.

12:54.634 --> 12:55.883
All right.
What do you need?

12:55.936 --> 12:59.020
A big win,
something to get everyone

12:59.055 --> 13:01.356
back on the same side
of the aisle.

13:01.391 --> 13:04.359
Like what?

13:04.394 --> 13:07.061
My government is terrified
of your Omec friends.

13:07.113 --> 13:08.863
We're hardly friends,

13:08.898 --> 13:10.698
and just so you know,
there's only two of them.

13:10.734 --> 13:13.901
Doesn't matter.
They have a harvester in orbit.

13:13.954 --> 13:16.704
Ask any Votan...
bad things happen

13:16.740 --> 13:20.291
when an Omec harvester
arrives in orbit.

13:20.327 --> 13:24.629
My people are scared,
and when my people get scared,

13:24.664 --> 13:28.166
they have a history
of doing stupid things.

13:28.218 --> 13:32.136
Like sabotaging an ark and
slaughtering an entire race?

13:32.172 --> 13:35.006
I can't confirm that,
but I won't...

13:35.058 --> 13:37.058
I won't insult you
by denying it.

13:39.512 --> 13:43.264
I want you to broker a sit-down
between me and their leader.

13:43.266 --> 13:47.568
Give me a chance to convince him
we mean his people no harm.

13:47.604 --> 13:50.154
T'evgin hates the V.C.
He'll never agree to this.

13:50.190 --> 13:53.274
You want peace
with the Votanis Collective?

13:53.326 --> 13:56.911
Help me make peace
with the Omec.

13:56.946 --> 13:58.946
That's my price.

14:07.924 --> 14:09.040
What are you gonna do?

14:09.092 --> 14:10.425
What do you think?

14:10.460 --> 14:11.876
The Votanis Collective
doesn't hand out

14:11.928 --> 14:14.462
fancy Indogene limbs
for nothing.

14:14.464 --> 14:19.183
You're right, they don't.
Wonder how Datak earned his.

14:19.219 --> 14:22.020
Hey, Datak.
Answer time.

14:22.055 --> 14:23.354
Looking for a fight?

14:23.390 --> 14:24.605
Nolan, stop.

14:24.641 --> 14:26.140
How did you avoid
getting blown up?

14:26.192 --> 14:27.141
Don't do this!

14:27.193 --> 14:28.226
Listen to your child.

14:28.278 --> 14:31.479
What did you do?

14:31.531 --> 14:32.864
Make a deal
with Rahm Tak?

14:32.899 --> 14:35.283
Is he gonna come waddling
down the Hollows next?

14:35.318 --> 14:37.235
Rahm is dead
and deservedly so.

14:37.287 --> 14:39.787
Yeah? Why aren't you?
Ah!

14:39.823 --> 14:42.040
Because a tiger is unable
to change his stripes.

14:42.075 --> 14:43.624
Oh!

14:43.660 --> 14:45.543
But remains a tiger
nonetheless.

14:45.578 --> 14:48.329
How about I tear off that
robot arm and beat you with it?

14:48.331 --> 14:49.414
I don't think so.

14:49.466 --> 14:50.498
Ah!

14:50.550 --> 14:52.133
I've endured
many hardships,

14:52.168 --> 14:54.502
and I will now make love
to my beautiful wife.

15:06.349 --> 15:07.682
You're coming home.

15:07.734 --> 15:08.683
I'm not done
with him yet.

15:08.735 --> 15:10.735
Nolan, stop!
You're scaring me.

15:25.528 --> 15:28.963
Go away!

15:28.998 --> 15:32.500
Sell your Girl Scout Cookies
somewhere else... I'm busy.

15:32.535 --> 15:35.336
I'm worried about Nolan.
He's drinking a lot.

15:35.372 --> 15:37.538
I think he might be
hallucinating.

15:37.540 --> 15:40.208
Well, that could be a side effect
of the surgery.

15:40.243 --> 15:42.126
The arktech that I couldn't
remove from his brain,

15:42.178 --> 15:44.011
there's a chance
that it inflamed the tissue

15:44.047 --> 15:45.430
in his temporal lobe.

15:45.465 --> 15:49.550
That kind of swelling could cause
emotional outbursts and that...

15:49.602 --> 15:52.220
and... and that...

15:52.272 --> 15:55.390
Doc?

15:55.392 --> 15:58.025
Doc, can you come
take a look at him?

15:58.061 --> 16:01.112
Not today... I have a project
that demands my full attention.

16:01.147 --> 16:03.731
Please.
I'm really scared.

16:06.569 --> 16:09.904
Fine.

16:09.906 --> 16:11.906
This should curb
his aggression.

16:11.958 --> 16:13.791
One notch only.

16:13.827 --> 16:18.663
Any more, and you'll knock him
flat on his ass, so just...

16:18.715 --> 16:20.631
so...

16:20.667 --> 16:23.584
Are you okay?

16:23.586 --> 16:26.220
I'm fine.

16:26.256 --> 16:28.806
I'm fine.
Bring him by tomorrow.

16:28.842 --> 16:31.058
In the meantime,
I really need you to leave.

16:31.094 --> 16:32.093
Are you sure?

16:32.095 --> 16:34.095
Get out!

16:48.611 --> 16:50.611
Okay.

16:50.663 --> 16:53.030
Deep breath.

16:53.082 --> 16:54.582
Come on, gorgeous,
you can do this.

16:54.617 --> 16:58.753
Just calmly...
Just calmly pull it out.

17:09.465 --> 17:12.467
Frickin' Omec bitch!

17:18.942 --> 17:21.809
The afterlife suits you,
my love.

17:23.730 --> 17:26.396
May I haunt you
forevermore?

17:28.651 --> 17:30.651
Mmm.

17:32.906 --> 17:36.541
I heard Dr. Yewll put a bomb
in your arm.

17:39.546 --> 17:41.546
How did you escape?

17:43.666 --> 17:45.416
Don't.

17:47.837 --> 17:52.173
You don't have to
pull away.

17:52.225 --> 17:55.259
You know I find pragmatism
alluring.

17:58.097 --> 18:01.098
Mmm.

18:03.520 --> 18:08.940
Did you get to see
Rahm Tak's face as he died?

18:08.992 --> 18:16.113
At the time, I was rather
focused on running for my life.

18:16.165 --> 18:22.003
In my imagination though,
it was glorious.

18:23.923 --> 18:26.007
Favis?

18:26.042 --> 18:27.341
What?

18:27.377 --> 18:29.343
You have visitors.

18:38.388 --> 18:42.723
Hello, Amanda.
You're looking well.

18:42.725 --> 18:46.287
Vice Chancellor,
this is a great honor.

18:46.322 --> 18:48.693
_

18:49.074 --> 18:51.356
_

18:51.919 --> 18:54.156
_

18:55.572 --> 18:57.905
How may we help you?

18:57.957 --> 18:59.540
You're close with T'evgin.

18:59.576 --> 19:02.076
He helped hide you
when you were a fugitive.

19:02.128 --> 19:04.662
I understand
he enchanted you.

19:04.714 --> 19:05.963
Dirty girl.

19:05.999 --> 19:09.250
This meeting is over.
Out.

19:09.302 --> 19:10.918
Where is this going,
Amanda?

19:10.970 --> 19:14.388
I'm having a reception tonight
and I need T'evgin there.

19:14.424 --> 19:17.341
You're going to use
your influence

19:17.393 --> 19:18.426
to make that happen.

19:18.478 --> 19:20.261
Why should my wife
do anything for you?

19:20.313 --> 19:22.930
You beat her,
turned her into a pariah.

19:22.982 --> 19:25.766
Your wife caused
a lot of damage to this town.

19:25.818 --> 19:28.102
Your wife is a murderer.

19:28.154 --> 19:31.522
Her crimes were all pardoned,
by you, if I remember correctly.

19:32.859 --> 19:35.943
I'm asking because
T'evgin's presence tonight

19:35.995 --> 19:39.163
will help bring us peace
with the V.C.

19:39.198 --> 19:41.782
Pardon or no pardon,
you owe us.

19:41.834 --> 19:44.168
That's justice.
I dare you to deny it.

19:44.203 --> 19:46.621
True enough.
However,

19:46.623 --> 19:50.291
my relationship with T'evgin
has recently grown complicated.

19:50.343 --> 19:52.677
Well, you're smart.
You can figure it out.

19:52.712 --> 19:53.961
Sweet-talk him.

19:53.963 --> 19:55.763
Wiggle your fanny.
I don't give a crap.

19:55.798 --> 19:57.348
Just get it done.

19:57.383 --> 19:59.467
I cannot.

19:59.469 --> 20:03.137
Okay. Well, we could do this
a different way then.

20:03.139 --> 20:07.108
Stahma, you will bring
the Omec to me tonight.

20:07.143 --> 20:10.277
In return, I will cancel my plan
to have Silora's soldiers

20:10.313 --> 20:13.314
put a bullet through the back
of your husband's head.

20:18.454 --> 20:20.071
I cannot go to T'evgin!

20:20.123 --> 20:21.489
You're not listening.

20:21.541 --> 20:24.492
Amanda Rosewater is itching
for a reason to see me dead.

20:24.494 --> 20:27.078
The Enchanter wants
to spirit me away to Australia.

20:27.130 --> 20:29.330
Do you have any idea
where Australia is?

20:29.332 --> 20:30.881
Why would I know
something like that?

20:30.917 --> 20:33.501
It's far.
You would never see me again.

20:33.503 --> 20:35.052
Here's a novel idea.

20:35.088 --> 20:37.054
Tell the Enchanter,
"No, thank you."

20:37.090 --> 20:38.506
Tell him that you
love your husband!

20:38.558 --> 20:40.341
You do not understand
the Omec.

20:40.343 --> 20:41.392
And you do?

20:41.427 --> 20:43.761
If I refuse him,
he will take me by force.

20:43.813 --> 20:44.895
You don't know that.

20:44.931 --> 20:46.430
It is in his nature.

20:46.482 --> 20:48.983
You're under my protection.

20:49.018 --> 20:51.936
I wish that were enough.

21:09.418 --> 21:12.419
Come closer.

21:12.421 --> 21:14.921
I am afraid.

21:14.957 --> 21:17.090
Why is that?

21:17.092 --> 21:20.010
Because I must decline
your offer.

21:28.687 --> 21:32.406
You still fear me.
Do you?

21:34.576 --> 21:37.994
Good.

21:38.030 --> 21:44.084
Do you well to fear me,
Stahma Tarr of Shanje Liro.

21:44.119 --> 21:47.120
Back home, I enchanted

21:47.122 --> 21:51.925
score upon score of little
Castithan boys and girls,

21:51.960 --> 21:57.381
and every one as pretty
and clever as you.

21:57.433 --> 22:02.436
I loved them, killed them,
and devoured them,

22:02.471 --> 22:04.971
because I am a predator.

22:04.973 --> 22:10.777
And you, Favi,
are my historic prey.

22:10.813 --> 22:13.563
At this moment,
I don't think you understand

22:13.615 --> 22:16.533
your place
on the food chain.

22:24.376 --> 22:25.649
This is...

22:25.684 --> 22:27.684
_

22:28.080 --> 22:31.415
It will never conform
to your traditions.

22:31.467 --> 22:35.669
The old ways are dead.

22:35.721 --> 22:38.672
Your daughter, I think,
could not accept this

22:38.674 --> 22:41.308
and was punished.

22:41.343 --> 22:48.765
You punished her because you,
T'evgin, know better.

22:48.817 --> 22:52.853
You are wise.

22:52.855 --> 22:55.689
That is empty flattery.

22:55.691 --> 22:58.358
It is empty only
if you fail to act

22:58.410 --> 23:02.078
in accordance
with your wise heart.

23:02.114 --> 23:04.998
There is a dinner reception
tonight

23:05.033 --> 23:08.201
to honor
the Votanis Collective...

23:08.253 --> 23:12.289
your ancient enemy,
I know,

23:12.341 --> 23:16.293
but the Vice Chancellor
has requested your presence

23:16.345 --> 23:19.546
to discuss peace.

23:19.598 --> 23:22.966
I will never break bread
with those animals

23:23.018 --> 23:26.686
that murdered my people.

23:26.722 --> 23:29.890
As you murdered theirs.

23:29.942 --> 23:32.692
Each side has ample reason
to despise the other

23:32.728 --> 23:36.947
for atrocities committed
long ago and far away.

23:36.982 --> 23:41.701
But here and now,
there is no reason for hatred

23:41.737 --> 23:44.654
and every reason
to seek peace.

23:44.706 --> 23:52.329
Your family sleeps in orbit
above us, Eksu Tsuroz T'evgin.

23:52.381 --> 23:55.215
What sort of home
will you build for them?

24:34.623 --> 24:37.424
Oh, the humanity.

24:47.469 --> 24:49.853
I told Amanda I'd cover
the reception tonight

24:49.888 --> 24:52.556
with Poole.

24:52.608 --> 24:54.357
You can stay here and rest.

24:56.194 --> 24:57.694
I saw Doc Yewll.
She thinks

24:57.729 --> 25:00.196
the arktech in your head
is hurting you.

25:00.232 --> 25:01.531
Doc Yewll's a liar.

25:01.567 --> 25:02.732
She saved our lives.

25:04.987 --> 25:09.489
She gave me this medicine
to help calm you down.

25:09.541 --> 25:11.241
I need my edge.

25:11.293 --> 25:13.159
I don't buy these
<i>bullshtak</i> peace talks,

25:13.211 --> 25:14.327
not for one second.

25:14.379 --> 25:16.162
No.
What's their angle?

25:16.214 --> 25:18.465
If it were me running
the Votanis Collective,

25:18.500 --> 25:20.300
I'd lure the purple
out in the open,

25:20.335 --> 25:22.002
blow him away,
and take his ship.

25:22.004 --> 25:23.303
Yeah, it makes sense.

25:23.338 --> 25:25.088
Control the skies,
control the world.

25:25.140 --> 25:26.840
Wait, where are you going?

25:26.842 --> 25:28.058
To stop an assassin.

25:28.093 --> 25:29.509
No, don't go.

25:29.561 --> 25:31.344
Are you working
against me?

25:34.182 --> 25:37.100
Don't!

25:37.152 --> 25:40.153
Do not follow me.

25:50.082 --> 25:52.365
Oh, sweet Jesus,
do I smell coffee?

25:54.202 --> 25:56.536
We always bring a few sacks
of beans when we travel.

25:56.588 --> 25:58.338
It goes over so well
with you Northerners.

25:58.373 --> 25:59.706
Ahh.

26:01.710 --> 26:02.709
How long has it been?

26:02.711 --> 26:04.794
Mmm.
Since I was a teenager,

26:04.846 --> 26:06.880
- before Arkfall.
- Oh.

26:06.932 --> 26:09.716
You know, these coffee plants
grow in Peru?

26:09.718 --> 26:11.267
There's a little area

26:11.303 --> 26:14.721
miraculously untouched
by Arkfall.

26:14.723 --> 26:16.773
My father used to take me
camping there.

26:16.808 --> 26:20.060
He wanted me to appreciate
the world that was.

26:20.062 --> 26:21.895
He sounds
so progressive.

26:21.897 --> 26:23.146
He was.

26:23.198 --> 26:26.983
Unfortunately, it's what
got him shot in the head.

26:27.035 --> 26:27.984
I'm so sorry.

26:28.036 --> 26:28.985
Oh, don't be.

26:29.037 --> 26:31.738
Onulu Toruku had
enemies to spare.

26:31.740 --> 26:33.740
Onulu Toruku?

26:33.792 --> 26:37.293
The man whose death
started the Pale Wars, yes.

26:37.329 --> 26:40.046
His killer was never caught,
so I changed my name

26:40.082 --> 26:42.749
and went into hiding
for the duration.

26:42.801 --> 26:46.419
Do you think it was a human
that pulled the trigger?

26:46.471 --> 26:47.804
I'd hate to think
the entire world

26:47.839 --> 26:50.590
went to war
for nothing.

26:50.642 --> 26:52.759
Is that supposed to be
a joke?

26:52.761 --> 26:55.595
No, a poor one,
a poor one.

26:55.597 --> 26:57.263
Both sides wanted war,
both sides fanned

26:57.315 --> 27:00.600
the flames of bigotry to get it,
and in the end,

27:00.602 --> 27:04.437
we almost destroyed the only
habitable planet that we've got.

27:04.489 --> 27:05.772
Well, your father
was a hero,

27:05.824 --> 27:08.608
and you're following
in his footsteps.

27:08.660 --> 27:10.944
Just trying to get the world
back on track,

27:10.946 --> 27:13.913
for his sake
and for ours.

27:13.949 --> 27:16.116
Well, if T'evgin
shows up tonight,

27:16.118 --> 27:19.252
I will do whatever I can
to help.

27:19.287 --> 27:21.254
I know you will.

27:29.014 --> 27:31.131
What do you think
that goon's carrying,

27:31.183 --> 27:35.351
something to kill the Omec?
Maybe chemical weapons?

27:35.387 --> 27:38.388
Don't know.
Let's find out.

27:57.328 --> 27:59.562
Ahh.

27:59.597 --> 28:00.780
Madam Mayor.

28:00.832 --> 28:05.668
Ah, Datak, welcome.
Is this your servant girl?

28:05.703 --> 28:09.005
My wife, as you may have
guessed, is otherwise occupied.

28:10.341 --> 28:11.507
I'm Andina.

28:11.542 --> 28:14.343
Let's mingle, dear.
And do stop fidgeting.

28:17.965 --> 28:20.216
The guest of honor is here,
and this is good.

28:20.268 --> 28:21.851
You'll never guess
who's with him.

28:21.886 --> 28:24.220
Oh, I think I have
a pretty good idea.

28:26.307 --> 28:30.526
Hello, everyone.
Can I have your attention?

28:30.561 --> 28:33.229
Citizens of Defiance,

28:33.231 --> 28:35.948
honored guests
of the Votanis Collective,

28:35.983 --> 28:39.285
we gather here tonight
to not only begin the process

28:39.320 --> 28:43.656
of putting the past behind us,
but to blaze a new trail

28:43.708 --> 28:47.993
into a peaceful future
for everyone under the sun.

28:48.046 --> 28:50.579
A toast,
to peace on Earth.

28:50.581 --> 28:51.747
To peace on Earth.

28:51.799 --> 28:54.383
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

28:57.171 --> 29:00.673
I'm so glad
you could make it.

29:00.725 --> 29:02.758
Both of you.

29:02.810 --> 29:05.811
Yes.
Such a pleasure.

29:09.233 --> 29:14.186
Our Favi looks radiant,
like a princess.

29:14.238 --> 29:16.238
And the Omec's
so handsome.

29:19.861 --> 29:22.862
Try not to stand
like a scullery maid.

29:37.298 --> 29:38.309
_

29:38.575 --> 29:41.815
_

29:42.202 --> 29:43.485
_

30:02.793 --> 30:05.424
_

30:06.824 --> 30:09.208
I know you people are planning
on killing the Omec.

30:09.243 --> 30:11.210
What I want to know is how.

30:11.566 --> 30:12.795
_

30:12.830 --> 30:14.497
Wrong answer.

30:20.638 --> 30:22.338
Do it.

30:22.390 --> 30:24.974
No, it'll make
too much noise.

30:31.682 --> 30:33.098
It's just coffee.

30:33.151 --> 30:34.850
All right.

30:34.902 --> 30:37.987
All right,
let's have a look around.

30:40.140 --> 30:42.762
_

30:43.046 --> 30:45.515
_

30:46.149 --> 30:49.764
_

30:49.867 --> 30:52.001
It pleases me
so very much

30:52.036 --> 30:54.420
you have found it
in your heart to attend.

30:54.455 --> 30:58.040
The heart is
a complicated thing.

30:58.092 --> 31:00.376
- Apologies for our tardiness.
- Yeah.

31:00.378 --> 31:03.796
Don't worry, I've heard nothing
but good things while we waited.

31:03.848 --> 31:05.548
The Mayor is too kind.

31:05.600 --> 31:08.601
Oh, well, I'm just happy
we're all here together.

31:11.522 --> 31:16.058
Uh, you didn't tell me
Kindzi would be joining us.

31:27.238 --> 31:31.040
Father,
so sorry I'm late.

31:31.075 --> 31:35.244
I'm happy I didn't
miss dinner.

31:35.246 --> 31:40.249
And Stahma, I promise you
I have brought my appetite.

31:41.836 --> 31:44.420
Listen to me, Stahma.
Go home.

31:44.422 --> 31:47.423
Secure your doors and windows
and allow no one to enter

31:47.425 --> 31:48.557
until I come for you later.

31:48.593 --> 31:49.975
But my husband...

31:50.011 --> 31:52.928
I am trying
to save your life.

31:52.930 --> 31:55.931
Leave, now!

32:10.281 --> 32:11.864
By the bed.

32:31.135 --> 32:33.852
Remote switch.

32:33.888 --> 32:35.888
Blasting caps.

32:35.940 --> 32:37.523
That's the plan.

32:37.558 --> 32:39.725
Build a bomb, set it off
at the reception,

32:39.777 --> 32:41.727
kill the Omec,
take their spaceship.

32:41.779 --> 32:45.114
And they have a perfect excuse
for declaring war on Defiance.

32:54.201 --> 32:57.444
_

32:58.532 --> 33:00.938
_

33:01.604 --> 33:04.271
Eksu, now that you have
served yourself,

33:04.307 --> 33:06.974
perhaps we might sit together
and discuss the future.

33:07.026 --> 33:10.111
Gladly. A brief word
with my daughter first.

33:10.146 --> 33:12.730
No rush.
We have all night.

33:14.222 --> 33:17.785
_

33:18.413 --> 33:22.040
_

33:22.075 --> 33:23.624
To feed.

33:23.659 --> 33:26.794
All these lesser races you're
so eager to make friends with,

33:26.829 --> 33:29.246
how eager will they be
once they learn of the slaughter

33:29.248 --> 33:30.714
that took place
this night?

33:30.750 --> 33:32.967
I will not permit it.

33:33.002 --> 33:35.586
Why do you struggle so
against your true nature?

33:35.638 --> 33:38.639
Let's feast together
like we've always dreamed,

33:38.674 --> 33:42.093
starting here,
right now.

33:45.431 --> 33:48.482
Hey! Hey!
Everybody, hold still.

33:48.518 --> 33:51.185
Hands where I can
see 'em!

33:51.237 --> 33:53.404
I have reason to believe
there's a bomb on the premises.

33:53.439 --> 33:54.522
Are you sure?

33:54.574 --> 33:57.408
I got the proof in here.
Okay, folks, all right.

33:57.443 --> 33:59.110
Keep your hands where
I can see 'em.

33:59.162 --> 34:02.413
Deputies, help facilitate.
Take a look around.

34:04.117 --> 34:05.282
Nolan, what are you
talking...

34:05.334 --> 34:06.867
I said hands where
I can see 'em!

34:06.919 --> 34:08.668
There is nothing
in that bag.

34:08.704 --> 34:09.954
Gun!

34:12.125 --> 34:13.456
No!

34:13.553 --> 34:15.643
_

34:15.678 --> 34:16.760
No!
What did you do?

34:16.795 --> 34:17.761
She had a gun.

34:17.797 --> 34:18.846
What did you do?

34:18.880 --> 34:20.464
- She had a gun.
- No she didn't!

34:20.516 --> 34:22.099
She had a gun!

34:22.135 --> 34:23.766
We need to leave now.

34:23.803 --> 34:24.969
They were gonna kill us.

34:24.971 --> 34:26.187
Nolan,
we need to leave.

34:26.222 --> 34:29.056
Don't!
No!

34:29.108 --> 34:30.558
After them!

34:30.610 --> 34:32.476
Get 'em!

34:55.333 --> 34:58.169
It's time you and I
put aside our differences.

34:58.171 --> 34:59.753
Nolan will be caught.

34:59.805 --> 35:00.888
You don't know that.

35:00.923 --> 35:02.840
I do.
I also know

35:02.842 --> 35:05.676
you'll be tempted to help him
evade justice.

35:05.728 --> 35:07.845
You have no idea
what's inside my mind.

35:07.847 --> 35:10.681
Silora was a moderate
surrounded by radicals.

35:10.683 --> 35:12.183
They will use her death
as an excuse

35:12.185 --> 35:14.235
to bring the power
of their army to bear

35:14.270 --> 35:16.687
on North America
and to this town.

35:16.739 --> 35:19.990
They will do it in her name
and in the name of her father,

35:20.026 --> 35:21.358
who was also assassinated
by a hum...

35:21.360 --> 35:23.861
This was not political.

35:23.913 --> 35:27.581
Nolan was delusional.
He has arktech in his brain...

35:27.617 --> 35:28.999
Votan arktech.

35:29.035 --> 35:31.285
You can't argue logic
with these people.

35:31.337 --> 35:34.171
You think Rahm Tak's death squad
was a threat?

35:34.207 --> 35:36.090
Wait until the strato-carriers
arrive

35:36.125 --> 35:37.091
with 100,000 foot soldiers!

35:37.126 --> 35:38.842
What's your point?

35:38.878 --> 35:43.964
Our only hope...
Defiance's only hope

35:44.016 --> 35:46.217
is to hand them
the Butcher of Yosemite

35:46.269 --> 35:48.385
on a silver platter.

35:48.387 --> 35:51.021
Disavow his actions,

35:51.057 --> 35:54.892
and pray to your human god
that it's enough.

35:57.230 --> 36:03.234
You do anything to betray Nolan,
and I will end you.

36:10.812 --> 36:12.808
_

36:14.950 --> 36:17.556
_

36:17.667 --> 36:19.333
Lose something?

36:19.385 --> 36:22.002
My daughter.

36:22.054 --> 36:23.721
You must return home.

36:23.756 --> 36:24.922
Must I?

36:24.924 --> 36:26.423
Stay close to your wife.

36:26.475 --> 36:29.093
Keep a weapon close at hand
and guard her.

36:29.095 --> 36:31.895
From who,
your daughter?

36:31.931 --> 36:33.147
I am searching for her.

36:33.182 --> 36:35.232
I will come and tell you
when Stahma is safe.

36:35.268 --> 36:37.101
The two of you
sheltered Stahma.

36:37.103 --> 36:39.770
Why would Kindzi
suddenly decide to kill her?

36:39.822 --> 36:42.189
The only possible way
for Kindzi to hurt me

36:42.241 --> 36:45.242
is to hurt someone I love.

36:46.412 --> 36:50.948
Yeah, well,
thanks for the warning.

36:51.000 --> 36:52.750
You must protect Stahma.

36:54.870 --> 36:57.871
To the death.

37:21.647 --> 37:23.530
I screwed up.
I screwed up bad.

37:23.566 --> 37:26.567
Let's go. We'll fix it.
Just keep moving.

37:34.293 --> 37:35.993
We're trapped.

37:35.995 --> 37:38.045
Only one thing left to do.

37:38.080 --> 37:40.914
Better to go out
in a blaze of glory.

37:40.966 --> 37:41.999
Live together.

37:42.001 --> 37:43.050
Die together.

37:43.085 --> 37:44.051
Let's do it.

37:44.086 --> 37:45.052
Nolan.

37:45.087 --> 37:46.053
Butch and Sundance.

37:46.963 --> 37:48.498
_

37:48.891 --> 37:50.507
Don't shoot.
It wasn't his fault.

37:51.644 --> 37:52.726
Cover me!

37:52.762 --> 37:54.478
- No!
- Ah!

38:04.907 --> 38:06.357
Kiddo.

38:07.993 --> 38:10.994
Please don't shoot.
We're unarmed.

38:19.062 --> 38:20.343
Kindzi!

38:22.032 --> 38:23.423
Kindzi?!

38:31.603 --> 38:33.104
_

38:33.598 --> 38:37.077
_

38:37.805 --> 38:40.695
_

38:41.794 --> 38:44.126
_

38:44.161 --> 38:45.549
_

38:45.584 --> 38:47.684
_

38:48.001 --> 38:49.417
_

38:49.575 --> 38:52.916
_

38:53.993 --> 38:56.747
_

38:57.726 --> 38:59.404
_

39:17.626 --> 39:19.409
I know you were
hallucinating last night.

39:21.747 --> 39:23.380
Irisa told you?

39:23.415 --> 39:25.215
Yeah, she did.

39:25.251 --> 39:26.917
Oh.

39:31.390 --> 39:34.174
You gonna let 'em take me
to South America?

39:35.594 --> 39:38.178
Don't want to.

39:38.230 --> 39:41.732
You have to.

39:41.767 --> 39:43.934
I know.

39:43.986 --> 39:47.020
I'm gonna travel with you
down to Brazil, argue your case.

39:47.072 --> 39:48.655
You go sticking your neck
out for me,

39:48.691 --> 39:50.607
they'll hang you from it.

39:50.609 --> 39:53.026
You stay here.
You too.

39:53.078 --> 39:54.278
I have to go.

39:54.330 --> 39:57.664
They know that if you're
separated, you both die.

39:59.668 --> 40:03.620
Well, then you have to keep me
alive, so they can kill me.

40:06.959 --> 40:09.626
It's time.

40:13.849 --> 40:16.350
Okay.

40:24.977 --> 40:28.278
Irisa.

40:28.314 --> 40:30.314
Here, take this.

40:30.316 --> 40:31.565
What's this?

40:31.617 --> 40:32.983
I took up a collection.
There's a lot of people

40:32.985 --> 40:34.484
in this town
who believe in Nolan.

40:34.537 --> 40:37.237
And when you get to Brazil,
you use it to bribe a guard

40:37.289 --> 40:38.539
and free him.

40:38.574 --> 40:40.457
All right? He'll fight you,
but do whatever it takes.

40:40.492 --> 40:42.626
Hit him on the head
if you have to.

40:42.661 --> 40:46.496
Then buy a boat
and head to Antarctica.

40:46.498 --> 40:49.550
You two can never
stop running.

40:49.585 --> 40:52.002
I'll make it happen.

41:00.930 --> 41:02.896
