WEBVTT

00:05.005 --> 00:07.757
[theme song playing]

00:54.554 --> 00:55.763
Okay, Carl,

00:55.847 --> 00:57.807
-your blood pressure looks good.
-[machine beeps]

00:57.890 --> 00:59.309
Now we're gonna do the thing
where I ask you

00:59.392 --> 01:00.977
some basic health questions
and you lie to me.

01:01.061 --> 01:01.895
Okay?

01:03.605 --> 01:05.648
Alcoholic beverages per week?

01:05.732 --> 01:07.150
Two, maybe three.

01:09.319 --> 01:10.820
Why you lying to me, Carl?

01:11.821 --> 01:13.406
Would you also like to lie to me
about smoking?

01:13.490 --> 01:14.949
I stopped smoking.

01:15.033 --> 01:18.703
Carl, the mouthwash works,
but the shirt smells like...

01:19.120 --> 01:20.080
Virginia Slims?

01:21.539 --> 01:23.291
They make my hands look bigger.

01:26.920 --> 01:29.339
I'm not gonna write that down
on the chart.

01:29.631 --> 01:31.966
Dr. Berkowitz will be here
in a minute, okay?

01:32.049 --> 01:34.511
Hey, uh, what's that picture?
Is that Halloween?

01:35.678 --> 01:37.806
Oh, no.
I think this was closer to Christmas.

01:38.306 --> 01:39.766
But you're wearing army clothes.

01:40.642 --> 01:41.476
Yes, I know.

01:41.559 --> 01:44.646
The camouflage look
was all the rage in Afghanistan.

01:46.148 --> 01:48.608
You went to Afghanistan for Christmas.

01:49.942 --> 01:51.319
I'ma give you a sec.

01:53.404 --> 01:56.199
-Oh!
-There you go!

01:56.783 --> 01:58.826
-Let me ask you--
-No, I never killed anyone.

01:58.910 --> 02:00.953
Yes, it was hot over there.
You're welcome for my service.

02:01.037 --> 02:02.079
Anything else?

02:02.164 --> 02:05.041
Well, I was just gonna ask you,
is your husband also a badass soldier?

02:05.125 --> 02:06.376
Oh, yeah, he was.

02:06.459 --> 02:09.254
-[gasps] Oh, my God, I'm sorry!
-[laughs] Oh...

02:09.337 --> 02:12.424
No, he... he was a badass soldier,

02:12.507 --> 02:14.592
but now he does private security
in Afghanistan.

02:14.676 --> 02:16.177
But any... anyways, we're separated.

02:17.387 --> 02:18.638
So, you're single. [chuckles]

02:20.223 --> 02:21.391
Yeah.

02:21.474 --> 02:24.269
Actually, I was just about to go home
and make dinner for my kids.

02:24.853 --> 02:25.854
Single mom.

02:26.688 --> 02:28.148
Well, this was fun.

02:32.402 --> 02:33.445
Alex.

02:35.155 --> 02:35.989
Alex, help.

02:42.078 --> 02:44.872
Papito,  let's go!
You know I got a bum shoulder.

02:44.956 --> 02:46.207
I need help over here.

02:55.425 --> 02:56.259
Thank you.

02:56.343 --> 02:57.677
Next time I'll Skype you.

03:12.734 --> 03:14.361
We have a problem.

03:15.862 --> 03:18.197
I know.
The hipsters have discovered Porto's.

03:18.281 --> 03:20.491
Line around the block
is like the freakin' Apple Store now.

03:21.075 --> 03:22.076
Mom!

03:22.159 --> 03:25.413
And this one,
I don't like her anymore.

03:26.873 --> 03:28.500
I don't care if you like me.

03:28.583 --> 03:30.543
Sounds like you're both
on the same page.

03:30.627 --> 03:33.212
Your daughter does not want
to have a  quinces.

03:33.296 --> 03:34.547
What? Why?

03:34.631 --> 03:37.467
We already booked the room,
and I found a great band!

03:38.510 --> 03:39.594
Okay, it's a deejay.

03:39.677 --> 03:41.304
Okay, it's your brother
with an iPod and a playlist,

03:41.388 --> 03:43.055
but it's a very good playlist.

03:43.139 --> 03:45.225
I researched
the history of  quinceañeras

03:45.308 --> 03:47.269
and found out
they're totally misogynistic.

03:47.352 --> 03:49.854
She's been reading again.
Why do you let her read?

03:51.522 --> 03:53.816
I know,  Mami.  I let her do math, too.
I'm a monster.

03:55.109 --> 03:58.112
By the way, they made me captain
of the debate team today at school,

03:58.195 --> 04:00.657
but all she wants
to talk about is this.

04:00.740 --> 04:02.950
She has to have a  quinces.

04:03.034 --> 04:07.079
How else will we know the day
that our little girl becomes a woman?

04:07.163 --> 04:08.290
You missed it.

04:08.373 --> 04:10.082
I was 12, I was in gym,

04:10.166 --> 04:12.460
and ironically,
it happened in first period.

04:18.049 --> 04:21.303
You are throwing away your Cuban heritage.

04:21.469 --> 04:23.179
Yeah, the bad part.

04:23.263 --> 04:25.973
I don't want to be paraded around
in front of the men of the village

04:26.057 --> 04:29.311
like a piece of property to be traded
for two cows and a goat.

04:29.394 --> 04:31.354
Someone thinks they're worth a lot.

04:34.649 --> 04:37.151
What century do you two think you're in?

04:37.360 --> 04:40.113
I mean, Elena, relax.
It's just a fun party.

04:40.196 --> 04:41.906
You know,
I'll have a little too much wine,

04:41.989 --> 04:44.116
embarrass you
while I sob during my toast,

04:44.200 --> 04:47.078
uh,  Abuelita  will dance inappropriately
with one of your guy friends--

04:47.161 --> 04:48.538
You can count on it.

04:51.749 --> 04:52.875
I'm not doing it.

04:52.959 --> 04:56.087
You need to do something
about this little  sinvergüenza.

04:56.671 --> 04:58.047
What does that even mean?

04:58.131 --> 04:59.257
It means...

04:59.757 --> 05:02.760
that you do not know enough Spanish
to know that I'm insulting you.

05:04.596 --> 05:06.681
Oye...
[speaking Spanish]

05:07.640 --> 05:09.476
-Ha!
-[speaking Spanish]

05:09.559 --> 05:12.061
-[laughs]
-Abuelita...

05:12.144 --> 05:14.606
[in English] I'll learn more Spanish
when you learn English.

05:16.566 --> 05:19.027
I know the English.

05:21.404 --> 05:24.907
Besides, your  abuelo,  God rest his soul,
did not marry me for my mind.

05:28.453 --> 05:29.662
Who do you think you're insulting?

05:31.581 --> 05:32.665
Good one, Mom.

05:32.749 --> 05:35.042
By the way, what are the last 16 digits
of your credit card?

05:35.126 --> 05:37.044
Uh, what are you doing?

05:37.128 --> 05:39.338
Are you shopping?
'Cause who said you could shop?

05:39.422 --> 05:41.340
You said I could order
sneakers for school.

05:41.924 --> 05:43.718
[laughs] Five pairs?

05:43.801 --> 05:45.136
Monday through Friday.

05:45.512 --> 05:47.680
Don't worry,
I don't need weekend sneakers.

05:47.764 --> 05:48.890
[chuckles] Oh, well...

05:48.973 --> 05:52.184
I can't have my son walking around
in Monday sneakers on a Saturday.

05:52.268 --> 05:54.186
Somebody might call child services.

05:55.563 --> 05:57.023
Mom, I'm serious.

05:57.106 --> 05:59.942
I'm in middle school now.
How I look kinda matters.

06:00.026 --> 06:02.987
Okay, so you can buy
one pair for under $40.

06:03.279 --> 06:04.113
Forty?

06:04.196 --> 06:06.491
That'll get you perfectly good sneakers
to last the whole year.

06:06.574 --> 06:08.326
The whole year?

06:08.701 --> 06:12.329
Okay, Mom, I know we're not rich,
but are we poor?

06:14.290 --> 06:16.959
No, we're... fine.

06:17.043 --> 06:18.836
-That sounds like poor.
-We're not poor!

06:18.920 --> 06:20.129
I mean, look around!

06:20.212 --> 06:22.674
We have a TV, a refrigerator.
You have a laptop.

06:22.757 --> 06:24.341
These are things that poor people have.

06:26.177 --> 06:27.053
We have an air conditioner.

06:27.136 --> 06:28.430
You never let us turn it on.

06:28.513 --> 06:31.474
The point is you could, but don't.
Don't ever touch that thing.

06:34.644 --> 06:37.855
All right, it's Friday night.
Family dinner time. Come on, let's go!

06:37.939 --> 06:40.525
Elena, come set the table!
Alex, help me make a salad.

06:40.608 --> 06:43.861
This meat was heavily discounted,
so I need to cook it before it turns.

06:46.656 --> 06:47.740
You guys already ate, didn't you?

06:48.324 --> 06:49.575
She made  ropa vieja.

06:49.659 --> 06:50.910
I'm not made of stone.

06:52.411 --> 06:54.872
Mami,  I told you this morning
that I was gonna cook tonight.

06:54.956 --> 06:56.791
I thought it was a joke!

06:56.874 --> 06:58.668
And I thought it was hilarious.

07:01.295 --> 07:03.756
Sorry, Mom.
Do you want us to sit and watch you eat?

07:03.840 --> 07:05.091
No. [chuckles]

07:06.259 --> 07:07.635
We'll just start next Friday.

07:07.719 --> 07:09.011
-Okay?
-Okay.

07:09.095 --> 07:10.179
-All right.
-Sounds good.

07:10.262 --> 07:13.600
So, there is some  ropa vieja
in the  mantequilla  thing

07:13.683 --> 07:17.019
if you don't want to eat that...
sad meat.

07:18.855 --> 07:20.398
I bought it, I'm eating it.

07:20.940 --> 07:22.817
-Okay.
-[pipes groaning]

07:24.026 --> 07:25.570
Oh, yeah, that's not working.

07:25.653 --> 07:27.530
Don't worry, I told Schneider.

07:27.614 --> 07:29.616
Here's some hand sanitizer.

07:29.699 --> 07:30.867
And here...

07:30.950 --> 07:32.785
-I don't need lipstick.
-Yes, you do.

07:32.869 --> 07:33.911
Okay.

07:36.080 --> 07:37.790
You know how much
I appreciate your help,

07:37.874 --> 07:40.334
but you have to let me
establish my own traditions.

07:40.417 --> 07:42.211
[bangs table] I agree.
So let's talk  quinces.

07:42.294 --> 07:44.421
Ay, Mami, ya!
I don't wanna force her.

07:44.506 --> 07:46.674
You know, this is all on me now.
I wanna handle it right.

07:47.550 --> 07:48.635
You know...

07:48.718 --> 07:53.848
a father would make sure
that his little girl had a  quinces.

07:53.931 --> 07:55.933
You really wanna go there?
'Cause I'm holding a hammer.

07:56.976 --> 08:00.312
I'm just saying, maybe when Victor
comes back, you can work it out.

08:00.897 --> 08:02.607
Remember when we all moved in together
and you said,

08:02.690 --> 08:04.984
"If you ever want me to go away,
just say, 'Go away.'"

08:05.067 --> 08:05.902
Yeah.

08:07.820 --> 08:08.988
Oh!

08:10.406 --> 08:12.241
[speaking Spanish]

08:12.324 --> 08:13.660
[banging]

08:20.291 --> 08:21.959
[banging stops]

08:34.681 --> 08:35.807
[coughs]

08:42.689 --> 08:45.274
[Lydia in English] You're welcome!

08:49.153 --> 08:50.196
[knocking on door]

08:56.327 --> 08:57.286
Schneider!

08:59.747 --> 09:01.373
Well, you grew out that mustache, huh?

09:01.457 --> 09:04.752
Yeah, I finally took the plunge
and went full handlebar.

09:04.836 --> 09:06.337
Feelin' really good about it.

09:07.421 --> 09:09.381
I feel like it says, "I mean business."

09:09.465 --> 09:11.551
Yes, if your business is taming lions.

09:12.134 --> 09:13.928
Oh, wait! I have one more.

09:14.512 --> 09:15.680
You're 40 and you look stupid.

09:15.763 --> 09:16.973
[sighs]

09:18.766 --> 09:20.142
I knew it!

09:20.560 --> 09:21.394
[groans]

09:21.477 --> 09:23.479
[laughs] What? Is... That's fake?

09:23.563 --> 09:26.315
Yeah, I'm not gonna grow a real one
until I know if people like it.

09:26.399 --> 09:30.278
And I'll have you know,
I was invited to several pride parades.

09:34.741 --> 09:36.576
Please tell me you're here to fix my sink.

09:36.659 --> 09:38.160
Yeah, fine!

09:41.538 --> 09:43.207
-Ooh, that's a cool hammer.
-Uh, careful.

09:43.290 --> 09:45.542
That's very expensive Damascus steel.

09:45.627 --> 09:48.838
Ah, so we've got
two fancy tools up in here.

09:49.672 --> 09:51.007
No, come on.
Come on! No.

09:51.090 --> 09:53.635
You know you're the only non-Latino
I trust to fix stuff.

09:53.718 --> 09:57.263
Oh, is that racist?
Oh, who cares, it's just us. [chuckles]

09:57.346 --> 09:58.973
-[speaks Spanish]
-[in English] Yeah, don't do that.

09:59.056 --> 10:00.432
I regretted it as soon as I said it.

10:01.350 --> 10:03.394
It's no problem.
I can get that done by tonight.

10:03.477 --> 10:05.229
Maybe after dinner.
What's your mom cookin'?

10:06.438 --> 10:08.565
You've really been
eating here a lot lately.

10:09.191 --> 10:10.985
Yeah, I like it, too.

10:12.904 --> 10:16.073
Can you believe it's only been
10 months since you moved in?

10:16.657 --> 10:18.367
I remember 'cause I got
my five year sober chip

10:18.450 --> 10:19.827
and your mom baked me that cake.

10:19.911 --> 10:22.496
Oh, I remember, yeah.
I'm sorry it was a rum cake.

10:23.915 --> 10:25.499
I enjoyed watching you guys eat it.

10:26.959 --> 10:28.544
Oh, by the way...

10:28.795 --> 10:31.798
looks like you accidentally
threw these out.

10:31.881 --> 10:33.716
-I found 'em in the trash.
-Hmm.

10:33.800 --> 10:35.176
Wonder how they got there.

10:36.177 --> 10:40.014
Hey... listen, you can tell me anything.

10:40.597 --> 10:44.185
There's a landlord-tenant
confidentiality clause in your lease.

10:45.186 --> 10:46.437
No, there isn't.

10:46.520 --> 10:48.898
Okay, there's not,
but I really wanna know what's going on!

10:51.442 --> 10:54.904
Fine. They're anti-depressants
that Dr. Berkowitz thought I might need,

10:54.987 --> 10:56.948
but he doesn't know
what he's talking about, so...

10:57.031 --> 10:59.158
Yeah, it sounds like he
really cares about you.

10:59.241 --> 11:00.409
What a dick!

11:01.744 --> 11:04.371
I don't need them,
and I have to get them out of here

11:04.455 --> 11:06.165
because if my mom finds 'em,
it'll be, [inhales deeply]

11:06.248 --> 11:09.335
[imitates Lydia]  "Ay, Dios mío,
she's a junkie like the Amy Winehouser."

11:12.213 --> 11:14.048
Yeah, so, I will, uh...

11:14.131 --> 11:17.468
I'll just get that washer
and we'll get that thing fixed right up.

11:17.551 --> 11:20.554
Oh! Hello, Schneider.

11:22.724 --> 11:24.225
Hola, señora.

11:24.308 --> 11:26.060
[laughs]

11:26.143 --> 11:28.104
Oh, you shave out your mustache.

11:28.187 --> 11:30.732
-What, you liked it?
-Oh, yes. It made me laugh.

11:33.442 --> 11:34.736
Elena!

11:34.819 --> 11:35.820
[speaks Spanish]

11:35.903 --> 11:37.947
-[in English] Come out here, honey.
-What's up,  Abuelita?

11:38.030 --> 11:39.866
Okay, listen, uh... [clears throat]

11:39.949 --> 11:43.160
I know you got issues
with the  quinces,  but--

11:43.244 --> 11:44.453
-All right...
-No, no, no. No, no.

11:44.536 --> 11:47.373
-[sighs]
-But I am going to show you something...

11:47.456 --> 11:50.918
that I think might change your mind.

11:59.593 --> 12:01.262
This could be you.

12:04.140 --> 12:06.558
Mommy, please, put those away.
I hate those pictures. Burn it!

12:08.978 --> 12:12.106
Oh, hey! The  quinceañera.
You're doing it!

12:12.189 --> 12:13.983
Elena, I knew you'd come around.

12:14.066 --> 12:16.610
She didn't! She thinks
she's being sold into slavery.

12:16.693 --> 12:18.070
That's not really part of it, right?

12:20.072 --> 12:21.698
You know what?
Let me talk to her. [grunts]

12:21.783 --> 12:23.826
I've been doing some outreach
down at the rec center,

12:23.910 --> 12:25.077
talking to at-risk youth.

12:25.161 --> 12:26.871
No, I don't think you should do that.

12:26.954 --> 12:28.080
Hey, girl.

12:31.042 --> 12:32.376
How you livin'?

12:34.670 --> 12:38.174
Your  abuela  wants to throw you
a sick kick-back on a Saturday night.

12:38.257 --> 12:40.301
You know, keep it hundred.

12:41.927 --> 12:42.762
You down?

12:43.179 --> 12:44.763
What's happening right now?

12:45.597 --> 12:47.934
Schneider, she's gonna do it.
I got this.

12:48.017 --> 12:51.687
You know what, Captain Debater?
Let's debate this.

12:51.770 --> 12:55.107
But we're not doing a regular debate.
It's gotta be that thing I saw you do

12:55.191 --> 12:58.527
where we argue the opposite side
to better understand each other.

12:58.610 --> 13:01.780
You mean a Lincoln-Douglas debate?
My specialty?

13:01.864 --> 13:04.783
I once successfully
argued against gravity, so...

13:04.867 --> 13:07.954
Ooh, I'ma take my earrings off...

13:09.163 --> 13:11.498
'cause it's about to go down!

13:13.792 --> 13:16.337
[grunting playfully]

13:18.380 --> 13:19.590
[Elena clears throat]

13:20.674 --> 13:24.136
The issue before us
is  quinces  or no  quinces.

13:24.720 --> 13:25.554
Okay...

13:26.388 --> 13:27.389
so I'm you.

13:28.307 --> 13:29.725
[imitates Penelope] Mmm, listen kid!

13:30.309 --> 13:33.854
A  quinces  is just about the village
celebrating that you're a woman,

13:33.938 --> 13:36.523
which I know you know 'cause
you're the smartest one in the family!

13:36.607 --> 13:39.401
[laughs] Oh,
I got better moves than that, right?

13:39.485 --> 13:41.153
[all] Eh...

13:43.531 --> 13:44.907
But village isn't literal.

13:44.990 --> 13:47.034
It just means your family
and your friends.

13:47.118 --> 13:49.161
So, what's so bad
about this modern village

13:49.245 --> 13:51.455
coming together to celebrate you?

13:51.538 --> 13:53.165
-Oh, yeah! She's good.
-Oh.

13:53.249 --> 13:55.001
Oh, my money's on her.

13:55.084 --> 13:56.878
[chuckles] You guys
wanna start takin' bets?

13:56.961 --> 13:59.296
Actually, scratch that.
I'm addicted to gambling.

14:00.464 --> 14:02.633
Okay, now I'll be you.

14:06.595 --> 14:08.139
[imitates Elena] Oh, my God!

14:08.222 --> 14:10.933
Do you even hear yourself?
Seriously!

14:11.017 --> 14:15.521
Your argument is that my adulthood
has to be approved by your friends?

14:15.813 --> 14:16.689
Pass!

14:21.318 --> 14:23.112
Well, I'm not gonna clap for that.

14:26.282 --> 14:29.493
[in Spanish accent] So you want
to crush my heart into pieces...

14:31.370 --> 14:34.456
after I worked so hard
to give you an opportunity

14:34.540 --> 14:37.418
in this land of the free
and home of the brave?

14:39.211 --> 14:40.671
That's not me, that's her.

14:42.923 --> 14:45.467
You make me sound like I have an accent.

14:48.845 --> 14:52.099
[clears throat] Let's end this. Elena,

14:52.683 --> 14:55.936
you wrecked your first communion
because, as a vegetarian,

14:56.020 --> 14:58.105
you wouldn't eat the body of Christ.

14:58.689 --> 15:01.025
You even refused
to take any pictures with Santa

15:01.108 --> 15:04.820
because your  abuelita  wouldn't admit
that Christmas is a pagan ritual.

15:04.904 --> 15:09.325
Jesus and Santa were cousins.
Everybody knows this.

15:14.747 --> 15:17.583
So, when it comes to your  quinces...

15:17.875 --> 15:19.543
I'm pleading with you.

15:19.710 --> 15:23.547
Can't you do this one thing
for your mother who loves you?

15:26.800 --> 15:28.260
Okay, Mom, I'll do it.

15:28.344 --> 15:30.137
[all gasp]

15:30.221 --> 15:31.305
Wait, what?

15:31.889 --> 15:34.600
I'm saying, you win!

15:35.184 --> 15:37.895
You should have a  quinces
like you just proved.

15:37.979 --> 15:40.147
[all laughing]

15:40.230 --> 15:42.650
Dang!  Mami  set you up!

15:43.943 --> 15:45.319
I didn't realize how right I was.

15:45.402 --> 15:46.988
She said a bunch of stuff
I didn't even think of!

15:47.071 --> 15:48.322
[laughs]

15:50.074 --> 15:51.492
Mami,  [speaks Spanish].

15:52.076 --> 15:54.995
Okay, this was stupid!
I'm still not having a  quinces.

15:55.079 --> 15:57.331
Oh, God, just accept it.
You're Cuban, you're 15,

15:57.414 --> 15:59.666
you're gonna have a big party,
with a poofy dress and a bad photo.

15:59.750 --> 16:00.751
It's what we do.

16:01.961 --> 16:03.920
[speaking Spanish]

16:07.633 --> 16:09.343
-[screams]
-[door slams]

16:10.302 --> 16:12.263
[in English] She can speak Spanish.

16:17.601 --> 16:19.603
Mrs. Doyle is in exam room three

16:19.686 --> 16:22.773
and I swear to God, if that  vieja
calls me Maria one more time...

16:24.316 --> 16:26.485
Mrs. Doyle has Alzheimer's.

16:26.568 --> 16:27.611
Oh, no, I'm so sorry.

16:27.694 --> 16:30.322
Hey, I'm messin' with ya.
She's just racist.

16:34.868 --> 16:38.122
What's going on with you today?
You're... you're all on edge.

16:38.789 --> 16:42.084
I had to put my foot down with Elena
about her  quinces,  and...

16:42.168 --> 16:45.004
I'm not sure if I did the right thing.
She wouldn't talk to me all weekend.

16:45.587 --> 16:47.423
Oh, don't worry. It gets better.

16:47.506 --> 16:49.008
Eventually they leave.

16:51.843 --> 16:53.970
[groans] It's just all on me now.

16:54.055 --> 16:56.890
Oh, yeah, every move you make
is fraught with peril.

16:56.973 --> 16:59.518
Is this gonna be the one
that scars them for life?

16:59.601 --> 17:02.896
And in my case,
the answer was always yes.

17:05.232 --> 17:09.153
Well, it's just a lot of pressure
and sometimes...

17:11.572 --> 17:12.531
I don't know.

17:14.200 --> 17:15.492
Did you ever take those--

17:15.576 --> 17:18.245
No, no. I threw them right in the trash.
It's fine!

17:18.329 --> 17:19.913
There's just a lot going on right now.

17:20.497 --> 17:22.332
But it's more than that, right?

17:23.417 --> 17:25.544
You were talking to me
about nightmares--

17:25.627 --> 17:26.878
I know what I said.

17:29.590 --> 17:31.592
Look, if...

17:32.509 --> 17:34.970
if you had something wrong
with your heart,

17:35.054 --> 17:37.556
and I gave you some medicine,
you would take it.

17:37.639 --> 17:39.558
So why wouldn't you
do the same with this?

17:40.851 --> 17:41.935
Yeah.

17:43.937 --> 17:46.232
But to be fair, I probably wouldn't take
that heart crap either.

17:46.315 --> 17:47.358
[chuckles]

17:47.441 --> 17:49.651
I mean, as a nurse,
I would totally recommend it,

17:49.735 --> 17:52.071
but as a Cuban, I suffer in silence.

17:53.238 --> 17:56.700
A silent Cuban?
Hey, I'd like to meet one of those.

17:57.201 --> 17:59.370
[laughing]

18:04.625 --> 18:06.793
-And she's a teenager, right?
-Right.

18:06.877 --> 18:08.920
At least I'm safe for another year
with the little one.

18:09.004 --> 18:10.047
[cell phone chimes]

18:10.547 --> 18:13.092
-Oh! Your phone telling you things.
-Oh, yeah.

18:14.050 --> 18:15.677
Alex ordered some sneakers for school.

18:15.761 --> 18:17.846
I get an alert
every time a package is delivered.

18:17.929 --> 18:20.141
[cell phone chimes repeatedly]

18:22.392 --> 18:24.478
How many feet does that kid have?

18:27.856 --> 18:32.361
Hey, so, for the  quinces,
is there any way I can get a plus three?

18:32.444 --> 18:35.989
Currently in a bit of a...
lady-juggling situation.

18:37.491 --> 18:40.869
No, I promised you to Consuelo. [laughs]

18:40.952 --> 18:43.580
Now, she has a good mustache.

18:46.417 --> 18:47.751
Just kidding. [laughs]

18:49.503 --> 18:51.004
It's not that good.

18:54.758 --> 18:55.634
Alex.

18:56.927 --> 18:57.761
Alex!

18:57.844 --> 18:59.180
He can't hear you!

18:59.263 --> 19:01.765
-[door closes]
-He is possessed by the YouTube.

19:05.977 --> 19:07.938
-I can explain.
-[Penelope] Really?

19:08.021 --> 19:11.525
You can explain how one pair of sneakers
magically became five?

19:11.608 --> 19:13.610
Because that is some
Jesus crap right there.

19:17.323 --> 19:19.866
Sorry I said Jesus
so close to the word crap.

19:22.828 --> 19:28.417
Mom, this family's been through a lot,
and I felt like I needed to provide...

19:29.210 --> 19:31.086
because I'm the man of the house now.

19:32.003 --> 19:34.965
Oh, that's why you bought
five pairs of sneakers?

19:35.549 --> 19:37.426
That's why I bought
no pairs of sneakers.

19:37.509 --> 19:39.928
Oh, he's into magic now? [laughs]

19:40.011 --> 19:42.138
Can I be your assistant? [laughs]

19:42.223 --> 19:44.641
No, I will become the focus.

19:47.644 --> 19:49.313
Free returns, Mom.

19:49.396 --> 19:51.940
I can order any pair I want,
wear them a couple of times.

19:52.023 --> 19:55.026
As long as I keep them clean,
I can send them right back.

19:55.110 --> 19:57.738
I know you wanna be mad,
but that's genius.

19:58.154 --> 19:59.490
No, it's not.

19:59.573 --> 20:01.700
Alex, there's no way
you can keep all these sneakers

20:01.783 --> 20:04.119
-clean enough to send back.
-Oh, no?

20:05.287 --> 20:07.122
Oh, so, it's six pairs of shoes?

20:07.206 --> 20:10.542
Okay, what about the bottoms?
You've been walking around all day.

20:12.294 --> 20:14.463
Oh, you're right, Mom.

20:22.596 --> 20:25.266
I mean, you gotta get him
on  Shark Tank  or something.

20:26.725 --> 20:30.271
No. No, this ends now.
It's like you're stealing.

20:30.354 --> 20:32.773
Exactly!
It's like I'm stealing.

20:32.856 --> 20:35.234
No, you're not
charming your way out of this.

20:35.317 --> 20:37.444
I said one new pair.
You disobeyed me.

20:37.528 --> 20:39.195
Now, you get no new pairs.

20:39.280 --> 20:42.741
No, you know what?
Now, you get Elena's old sparkly ones.

20:42.824 --> 20:45.327
With the multicultural princesses?

20:46.495 --> 20:47.329
No!

20:48.413 --> 20:51.250
Lucky for you, she never wore them
'cause they were too gender-specific.

20:52.876 --> 20:54.753
She did like that they were diverse.

20:55.921 --> 20:57.506
I'm not wearing those.

20:57.589 --> 20:59.883
I still don't understand
why I can't buy these.

20:59.966 --> 21:02.052
Don't you have more money
now that  Papi's  gone?

21:02.135 --> 21:03.304
[scoffs] What?

21:03.387 --> 21:06.682
Well, you have a job,
plus  Papi  gives you money, right?

21:06.765 --> 21:08.309
So that's, like, double money.

21:11.311 --> 21:12.145
Sit down.

21:12.228 --> 21:14.273
-[sighs]
-Let me talk to him.

21:14.356 --> 21:16.442
-Hey, little man... Okay.
-Out!

21:18.860 --> 21:21.363
Yes, your  papi  gives me money,

21:21.947 --> 21:24.157
but it's for the basics,
and it's not a lot.

21:24.240 --> 21:27.744
But he's absolutely doing his best,
and he will always be your  papi.

21:27.828 --> 21:30.997
But make no mistake,
when it comes to money,

21:31.081 --> 21:32.333
I'm your daddy.

21:34.042 --> 21:35.794
Tomorrow, these all go back.

21:39.130 --> 21:40.841
-Everything okay?
-[sighs]

21:40.924 --> 21:42.217
I need you to sign my test.

21:42.301 --> 21:44.345
Yes, everything is fine.
At least you're talking to me now.

21:46.597 --> 21:47.764
It says you got a D.

21:48.348 --> 21:49.182
I know.

21:49.766 --> 21:51.602
This is social studies. You love this!

21:51.685 --> 21:54.271
Yeah. I guess I didn't try

21:54.354 --> 21:57.399
because I don't need an education
now that I'm gonna be chattel.

21:59.526 --> 22:03.614
And without schoolwork, I have more time
to plan my magical  quinces.  So...

22:06.241 --> 22:08.369
[sighs]  Ay.  Okay.

22:08.452 --> 22:09.286
Enough.

22:09.578 --> 22:14.333
Yes, you keep that up,
and you will not have a  quinces.

22:14.875 --> 22:15.876
Wait...

22:19.212 --> 22:20.464
I can't believe you.

22:21.048 --> 22:24.968
You know how hard I bust my ass,
by myself, to send you to that school

22:25.051 --> 22:26.720
so that you can have
more opportunities than I did.

22:26.803 --> 22:28.639
Then you... you pull this crap?

22:29.681 --> 22:31.850
I can't even look at you right now.
Just go to your room.

22:34.728 --> 22:36.354
You keep saying that

22:36.438 --> 22:40.066
you want me to be this strong,
independent woman like you.

22:40.150 --> 22:42.819
And then, when I tell you that
I don't want to be a part of something

22:42.903 --> 22:45.363
that I think is
a misogynist cultural ritual,

22:45.447 --> 22:47.491
you tell me to shut up, do it anyway.

22:48.492 --> 22:50.285
[scoffs] So which is it, Mom?

22:55.957 --> 22:57.834
Lupita, are you okay?

23:04.299 --> 23:06.009
Ah, you're like me.

23:06.092 --> 23:08.804
You get upset and you clean.

23:12.390 --> 23:15.811
Wait, wait a minute.
Wait, what... what is that?

23:15.894 --> 23:17.438
It's an anti-depressant
that I'm gonna be taking.

23:17.521 --> 23:18.689
-[gasps]
-So just deal with it.

23:18.772 --> 23:21.942
That is your answer? Drugs?

23:22.025 --> 23:24.360
Okay, open your mouth
and spit it in my hand.

23:25.946 --> 23:27.823
I haven't even taken it yet!

23:28.406 --> 23:30.992
And it's okay, Mom.
It's something that helps.

23:31.076 --> 23:33.286
But do you even see
everything that's happening now?

23:33.369 --> 23:36.331
You don't need drugs.
You need your husband.

23:36.414 --> 23:37.833
Oh, God, stop it!

23:37.916 --> 23:39.626
Stop. Victor is not the answer.

23:39.710 --> 23:43.004
I know you didn't want him
to go back to Afghanistan,

23:43.088 --> 23:44.339
but he's making money.

23:44.422 --> 23:46.007
He's being a good provider.

23:46.091 --> 23:48.051
There are jobs here
where they don't shoot at you.

23:48.134 --> 23:50.178
We live in America, name one!

23:51.888 --> 23:54.307
It's not just the job,
and you know that!

23:54.390 --> 23:57.478
-It's not like he cheated on you.
-It's not the only thing that matters.

23:57.561 --> 24:00.689
We are Cuban.
We don't get divorced, we die.

24:03.400 --> 24:05.110
Don't you think I miss him?

24:06.987 --> 24:09.114
You think I like being alone?

24:10.574 --> 24:13.660
I wanted to do this with somebody.
That was the plan.

24:13.744 --> 24:15.621
Family dinners, and inside jokes,

24:15.704 --> 24:18.749
and one of the kids says something cute,
and you share a look.

24:18.832 --> 24:23.044
And even right now to be able to say,
"Okay, they're insane, we're not."

24:24.963 --> 24:26.172
A partner.

24:27.090 --> 24:29.050
[voice breaking] Someone to love.
Someone...

24:31.344 --> 24:32.762
someone in your bed.

24:34.514 --> 24:37.267
You know, since Victor's gone,
I don't sleep.

24:37.434 --> 24:40.812
Because he used to spoon me to sleep.
So, yeah, Mom...

24:41.146 --> 24:42.606
I miss the good stuff.

24:44.107 --> 24:46.401
Sometimes you just need somebody
to give you a hug

24:46.484 --> 24:48.236
and say, "I got you."

24:56.828 --> 24:58.204
I meant a man.

25:01.416 --> 25:03.752
I am very strong.

25:03.835 --> 25:05.629
I've been doing my yoga.

25:07.839 --> 25:09.090
I got you.

25:19.726 --> 25:20.727
[sighs]

25:24.522 --> 25:25.566
[Penelope] Hey.

25:26.149 --> 25:28.944
The ladies be looking at your feet.
Something's wrong.

25:29.027 --> 25:31.279
Am I right?

25:32.948 --> 25:34.157
I'm sorry.

25:34.866 --> 25:37.368
Nah, I think I can make these work.

25:37.452 --> 25:41.372
Or, I noticed you bought a pair
for under 40 bucks,

25:41.456 --> 25:42.708
which means you did the right thing

25:42.791 --> 25:44.960
before you did the many,
many wrong things.

25:45.043 --> 25:47.337
Really? Oh, thank you!

25:47.921 --> 25:48.838
I was trying to be brave,

25:48.922 --> 25:51.216
but even the nuns
would've made fun of me.

25:53.343 --> 25:56.221
Listen, you don't have to worry
about being the man of the house.

25:56.304 --> 25:58.389
First of all, we don't have a house,
so there's that.

25:59.850 --> 26:01.810
You just be
a twelve-year-old boy, okay?

26:01.893 --> 26:03.019
Okay.

26:03.103 --> 26:04.270
And you're right,

26:04.354 --> 26:06.522
I shouldn't worry too much
about what's going on down here,

26:07.107 --> 26:09.067
when I got so much going on up here.

26:10.318 --> 26:12.738
Ah! [laughs]

26:12.821 --> 26:15.115
Puberty's gonna hit you like a train.

26:20.370 --> 26:21.204
Hey.

26:22.289 --> 26:23.206
Hello.

26:24.916 --> 26:26.543
So there's been a lot of yelling.

26:27.544 --> 26:28.878
Okay, it was mostly me.

26:31.172 --> 26:34.300
But I hear you...
and you don't have to have a  quinces.

26:34.384 --> 26:36.594
Oh, thank you.
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

26:36.678 --> 26:39.139
Yeah, and this is not because
of that crap you pulled with the test.

26:39.222 --> 26:42.017
You do that again and I'll put
my  quinces  tiara on you while you sleep,

26:42.100 --> 26:44.435
and post it to your Instagram.
Don't test me.

26:46.521 --> 26:47.355
Okay.

26:49.149 --> 26:51.693
Look, I get the whole misogynist thing.
I do.

26:52.777 --> 26:56.740
But I hate to tell you lots of good stuff
has started for dumb man reasons.

26:57.657 --> 27:00.869
Yeah, like, marriage used to be
a way to pay off debts.

27:01.036 --> 27:02.578
Plus, women were being raped everywhere,

27:02.663 --> 27:04.414
so you'd marry your daughter off
to some guy and say,

27:04.497 --> 27:06.833
"Okay, he owns her now.
No raping this one."

27:11.672 --> 27:13.882
My point is we've made progress.

27:14.675 --> 27:17.093
I didn't know
you were such a feminist, Mom.

27:17.844 --> 27:21.472
I can assemble a rifle in 13 seconds.
I'm a total badass.

27:21.556 --> 27:22.766
How are you missing this?

27:22.849 --> 27:27.562
[chuckles] I'm sorry, it's just
a lot of times you sound like a mom.

27:27.645 --> 27:29.522
Yeah, well, I am one.

27:31.191 --> 27:33.526
And there is a part of me
that buys into that cheesy

27:33.609 --> 27:35.987
"my little girl
is becoming a woman" thing,

27:36.071 --> 27:37.864
because you're not
a little girl anymore.

27:40.784 --> 27:43.328
That is super weird. [sighs]

27:48.333 --> 27:51.503
If I'm being honest with myself,
I was making your  quinces  about me.

27:53.797 --> 27:55.548
I guess I wanted people
to show up and say,

27:55.632 --> 27:59.511
"Look at the amazing single mom
pulling it all together by herself."

28:01.262 --> 28:03.014
I know. It was dumb.

28:06.768 --> 28:08.978
It's not dumb. They're dumb.

28:09.979 --> 28:11.481
-Who?
-The people.

28:12.065 --> 28:14.109
No, there's no people,
that's just a thing that I said.

28:16.152 --> 28:17.654
No, I'll do it.

28:18.154 --> 28:21.742
All I wanted was a good reason why,
and you just gave me one.

28:22.575 --> 28:23.827
Oh, my God, really?

28:23.910 --> 28:26.537
[laughing] That is so great!

28:26.621 --> 28:29.540
We'll... we'll do the whole thing.
The ceremony, the stupid waltz.

28:29.624 --> 28:31.709
We're gonna show them
what single mothers can pull off.

28:31.793 --> 28:35.046
I will dress like a child bride
for you, Mom.

28:38.759 --> 28:41.136
Okay, now I feel like I
should talk you out of it. [chuckles]

28:42.012 --> 28:43.847
Yeah, but I won't. I won't.

28:43.930 --> 28:48.435
Your  abuelita,  she can be a broken record,
but she taught me life can be tough.

28:48.684 --> 28:51.187
So when you get something to celebrate,
you take it.

28:51.271 --> 28:52.605
Then take photos.

28:53.774 --> 28:55.901
Photos I'll use to scare your children.

28:55.984 --> 28:57.568
Oh, I'm not having children.

28:59.696 --> 29:00.613
Not today.

29:11.833 --> 29:13.459
[exhales heavily]

29:24.387 --> 29:25.221
Move over.

29:25.305 --> 29:26.306
What?

29:27.974 --> 29:29.059
What are you doing here?

29:29.142 --> 29:31.436
-I'm going to spoon you.
-No.

29:32.353 --> 29:35.523
-Yes, move over.
-Mami,  no!

29:35.606 --> 29:37.108
-Okay, shh!
-No!

29:37.192 --> 29:39.820
-You're gonna like this. It's very nice.
-No, don't do it.

29:39.903 --> 29:42.697
-Oh, yes, see? See?
-[sighs]

29:53.541 --> 29:55.001
[both] Mmm.
