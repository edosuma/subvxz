01:43.470 --> 01:47.507
Colonel George
Herbert Merryweather...

01:52.745 --> 01:53.880
ashes to ashes...

01:54.614 --> 01:55.682
dust to dust.

02:52.238 --> 02:53.907
Aah, Miss Merryweather.

02:58.144 --> 03:01.156
This being the last
will and testament of

03:01.157 --> 03:04.384
Colonel George Herbert
Merryweather of London.

03:06.219 --> 03:08.007
He... he...
lost it all?

03:09.889 --> 03:11.457
Including the house?

03:13.526 --> 03:14.460
No!

03:15.128 --> 03:16.729
No, Papa can't have been in London.

03:17.230 --> 03:19.867
Why, he wrote to me and
said that he was coming home,

03:19.868 --> 03:21.234
he wouldn't arrive and not...

03:24.704 --> 03:26.039
Aah, well...

03:26.306 --> 03:28.708
Your father did leave you this book...

03:31.611 --> 03:33.213
as your inheritance.

03:41.154 --> 03:44.958
"The Ancient Chronicles
of Moonacre Valley"

03:47.260 --> 03:48.728
I know it's hard...

03:49.862 --> 03:53.166
but you know I...
I'm sure that your father did...

03:53.700 --> 03:54.701
did love you.

03:57.704 --> 03:58.638
He just... um,

04:00.340 --> 04:01.247
and... and you know,

04:01.248 --> 04:04.377
everybody does have to go out on
their own at some point in their...

04:04.711 --> 04:05.044
lives.

04:05.712 --> 04:07.213
Miss Heliotrop, I'm fine!

04:08.147 --> 04:09.048
Really!

04:13.019 --> 04:13.720
Yes...

04:57.697 --> 04:59.232
"Once upon a perfect time...

05:00.867 --> 05:02.368
many hundreds of years ago...

05:03.036 --> 05:05.838
when the old magic called
Moonacre Valley...

05:07.707 --> 05:11.711
there was a young woman whose
skin glint as pale as the star...

05:12.011 --> 05:14.447
and whose heart was
as pure as a meteorite's...

05:15.348 --> 05:18.051
such was her bravery and goodness...

05:18.651 --> 05:20.219
she was beloved by nature...

05:20.787 --> 05:22.522
as if she was their daughter.

05:34.000 --> 05:35.635
One fateful night...

05:36.369 --> 05:39.972
the moon blessed her
with an extraordinary gift...

05:40.373 --> 05:42.208
with a tinge of the
magic of the valley...

05:43.109 --> 05:44.143
forever!

05:45.978 --> 05:47.046
The moon power!

05:51.050 --> 05:52.385
From that day forward...

05:52.752 --> 05:53.619
she was known...

05:53.953 --> 05:55.521
as the Moon Princess!

06:05.465 --> 06:08.835
Two ancient families lived in harmony
at the edge of the valley...

06:09.302 --> 06:10.136
sharing nature's bounty.

06:14.674 --> 06:16.376
Daughter to the De Noir clan...

06:16.576 --> 06:18.882
the Moon Princess
was deeply in love

06:18.883 --> 06:21.748
and was to be married
to Sir Wolf Merryweather.

06:25.151 --> 06:25.718
Her father,

06:26.018 --> 06:27.387
Sir William De Noir,

06:27.787 --> 06:31.724
blessed the union by presenting
the couple with a rare black lion.

06:32.258 --> 06:35.061
For my daughter's bridegroom!

06:45.071 --> 06:46.038
Thank you, father!

06:50.510 --> 06:54.714
In turn,
Sir Wolf gave his bride a unicorn.

06:54.747 --> 06:57.884
Littered from the
wild white horses of the sea.

07:01.654 --> 07:07.226
Only an animal of such beauty and purity
could be the companion of the Moon Princess.

07:07.326 --> 07:08.728
Her heart overflowed with happiness!

07:09.662 --> 07:13.332
The Moon Princess revealed
the magical powers to both families.

07:15.001 --> 07:18.337
This was found deep
in the heart of the ocean.

07:18.938 --> 07:20.540
This pearl was given to us

07:20.907 --> 07:22.608
by mother nature herself!

07:23.176 --> 07:26.045
Promising untold riches to us all.

07:26.879 --> 07:27.713
Look!

07:28.314 --> 07:29.782
They have a unique power!

07:30.316 --> 07:32.585
They can reveal the truth

07:33.019 --> 07:34.220
in man's heart!

07:34.987 --> 07:37.056
Legend told of their unique powers,

07:37.423 --> 07:40.393
so strong the pearls
will grant every wish.

07:40.493 --> 07:42.795
Both good and evil!

08:04.951 --> 08:05.518
Good bye...

08:07.753 --> 08:08.654
Good bye...

08:08.888 --> 08:11.257
You be Miss Maria Merryweather?

08:12.692 --> 08:13.392
My man!

08:14.126 --> 08:14.827
Quick!

08:18.464 --> 08:19.065
Madame...

08:21.701 --> 08:22.702
Get on with you!

08:24.136 --> 08:25.037
Good bye...

08:25.905 --> 08:27.039
yes, yes, yes...

08:27.340 --> 08:29.375
Miss Heliotrop?

08:29.575 --> 08:30.243
Maria...

08:31.010 --> 08:32.278
When your dear mother died,

08:32.979 --> 08:36.015
I promised her faithfully
that I'll take care of you.

08:36.582 --> 08:39.184
So I'm not going to abandon you now!

08:39.751 --> 08:43.789
If you're going to live with your uncle,
or in the middle of the country-side,

08:44.190 --> 08:45.558
then I shall be there with you.

09:13.386 --> 09:15.254
Where are my charcoal tablets?

09:15.621 --> 09:17.890
These are doing nothing
for my indigestion.

09:26.232 --> 09:28.367
How can I possibly go
live in the country?

09:29.168 --> 09:31.737
It's like a camp-site!

09:38.311 --> 09:40.713
Maria, there's only one thing
that can save us now.

09:41.047 --> 09:41.881
Clever girl,

09:42.014 --> 09:42.715
French,

09:43.015 --> 09:44.083
needle point.

10:12.011 --> 10:13.012
What's happening?

10:13.546 --> 10:14.246
Have we arrived?

10:16.582 --> 10:18.084
Is he deaf or something?

10:19.185 --> 10:20.820
The man is obviously a half wit.

10:47.279 --> 10:47.947
Who are they?

10:48.014 --> 10:49.148
What do they want?

10:49.248 --> 10:50.616
Don't worry my dear,

10:50.816 --> 10:52.451
Sir Benjamin will protect us, I'm sure!

11:17.176 --> 11:17.843
Miss...

11:29.155 --> 11:30.289
Welcome to Moonacre!

11:39.031 --> 11:40.633
Unfortunate circumstances.

11:41.100 --> 11:43.703
There we are, nothing to be done.

11:47.173 --> 11:49.108
I'm pleased to meet you, Uncle.

11:50.643 --> 11:51.577
Miss Heliotrop.

11:52.278 --> 11:53.212
Oh, Sir Benjamin.

11:53.713 --> 11:54.980
Oh, what a journey we had!!!

11:55.815 --> 11:58.217
Not one hour from this
very door we were accosted by

11:58.584 --> 11:59.351
a bunch of ruffians.

11:59.585 --> 12:00.985
Madame, please!
- It...

12:00.986 --> 12:03.522
Tell me your fascinating story
some other time if I may.

12:30.549 --> 12:31.784
His name is Wolf.

12:33.753 --> 12:35.321
There are those
who find him alarming.

12:35.621 --> 12:36.989
He can kill in an instant.

12:38.457 --> 12:39.391
But you're a Merryweather.

12:40.793 --> 12:42.394
He very probably won't harm you.

12:58.210 --> 13:00.746
Miss Heliotrop,
your room is over there to the right.

13:01.380 --> 13:02.782
Oh, thank you, Sir Benjamin.

13:05.551 --> 13:06.685
Well, come along Maria.

13:07.019 --> 13:08.888
I'm sure that your room...
will be next to mine.

13:09.088 --> 13:10.790
No, Maria's room is up in the tower.

13:11.457 --> 13:12.725
But, I'm kind...

13:12.892 --> 13:14.338
You have to inspect the room first

13:14.339 --> 13:15.961
before you turn your
nose up at whatever it is.

13:33.078 --> 13:34.380
Good night, Uncle!

13:36.582 --> 13:37.850
Charmed, I'm sure.

15:53.185 --> 15:54.653
What on earth is this?

15:59.291 --> 16:00.092
Oh, no!

16:01.460 --> 16:02.328
No, I think not.

16:38.597 --> 16:39.465
Young lady.

16:40.766 --> 16:42.101
We're taking breakfast in here.

16:44.303 --> 16:45.337
Where did you get this from?

16:46.505 --> 16:47.940
Oh um, papa left it to me.

16:50.042 --> 16:51.543
Well, he had no right...

16:52.277 --> 16:53.112
This belong here.

16:55.714 --> 16:56.782
But, that's mine!!

17:01.420 --> 17:02.521
Miss Heliotrop!

17:03.555 --> 17:04.256
Help!

17:04.455 --> 17:07.026
Help, tell him he can't
take my father's book from me!

17:08.027 --> 17:08.460
Maria!

17:09.361 --> 17:11.797
Good question!
Why don't you just speak...

17:11.896 --> 17:12.931
That he can't just go and...

17:13.165 --> 17:13.866
Maria!

17:14.500 --> 17:15.567
Don't worry.

17:15.634 --> 17:17.770
I'm sure that he's just keeping
it safe somewhere for you.

17:17.836 --> 17:19.371
Sit down.
Have your porridge.

17:19.872 --> 17:20.472
Miss.

17:32.017 --> 17:34.286
There be your breakfast, Miss.

17:41.860 --> 17:44.730
Maria, you really must
try this delicious omelet.

17:45.030 --> 17:48.500
Hum,um, a dish best
enjoyed in silence, I'm told.

18:01.780 --> 18:05.217
Uncle, when can you return
my father's book to me?

18:16.528 --> 18:17.429
Now,

18:17.663 --> 18:20.262
you certainly have a very,
very good cook, Sir Benjamin.

18:20.263 --> 18:21.767
Have you... have you had her long?

18:22.234 --> 18:25.003
Madame, no woman has stepped
in this house for years!

18:25.370 --> 18:28.707
And believe me,
the silence has been blissful.

18:33.745 --> 18:38.080
Now, I must say, this country food is
doing wonders for my trapped wind!

18:39.218 --> 18:42.888
Madame, please! Can't a man enjoy
a meal in his own home in silence?

18:53.432 --> 18:54.465
Well, do tell us Uncle...

18:55.300 --> 18:58.670
Why did you invite such
irritating and noisy females

18:58.871 --> 19:00.806
into your nice quiet house?

19:01.306 --> 19:02.407
I'd love to know.

19:04.042 --> 19:07.880
My useless brother died in debt
and it fell on me to take you in.

19:08.247 --> 19:10.849
The man was a... cowardly
good for nothing.

19:11.049 --> 19:11.950
Sir Benjamin!!

19:12.251 --> 19:13.886
How dare you say that?!

19:14.119 --> 19:15.654
My father was a Colonel!

19:15.687 --> 19:16.421
Yes.

19:16.688 --> 19:19.391
And he died in debt owing money
to half the regiment.

19:19.591 --> 19:20.993
He fought for his country!

19:21.260 --> 19:23.929
And got himself killed
in a backstreet gambling den.

19:24.930 --> 19:27.799
Borrowed money once too many times
from the wrong sort of money lenders.

19:30.435 --> 19:32.137
He wouldn't take money from me,
would he?

19:33.305 --> 19:33.638
Oh no.

19:33.972 --> 19:36.775
Damn, all his pride.

19:37.709 --> 19:39.645
You're a Merryweather, Maria...

19:40.212 --> 19:43.048
And this is where you belong.
Here, at Moonacre.

19:44.583 --> 19:45.417
There we are.

19:45.984 --> 19:47.052
Nothing else to be done.

19:51.290 --> 19:54.526
Library is private
and my study prohibited.

19:58.096 --> 19:59.298
And in here...

20:00.899 --> 20:02.734
The East wing, closed...

20:02.901 --> 20:04.603
the West wing, out of bounds.

20:05.037 --> 20:05.604
There we are.

20:06.104 --> 20:08.106
- And here...
- Uncle, about that attack yesterday.

20:08.473 --> 20:09.708
Can't something be done?

20:09.875 --> 20:11.410
Yes... keep your little nose out.

20:12.010 --> 20:12.778
I beg your pardon?

20:12.978 --> 20:14.880
Just keep out of the forest.

20:15.814 --> 20:17.082
But why?
Who are they?

20:17.649 --> 20:21.220
There's a band of ruffians in the woods.
The De Noir clan.

20:22.054 --> 20:24.022
You mean like the "De Noir"
from the story book?

20:24.056 --> 20:25.324
No, no, no... these are real enough.

20:25.791 --> 20:28.360
Poachers, bandits, plunderers, robbers.

20:29.595 --> 20:30.095
Ladies.

20:30.896 --> 20:32.331
This should suit your needs.

20:34.132 --> 20:36.101
And this will be your classroom.

20:44.943 --> 20:47.977
(Speaking French)

23:14.726 --> 23:17.894
Digweed...
Bring me my whip.

23:19.498 --> 23:21.600
You weren't expecting me to...

23:22.033 --> 23:23.468
She can ride, can she?

23:23.635 --> 23:24.970
Oh, Sir Benjamin,
it's a matter of fact

23:24.971 --> 23:26.738
that a lady should never be
allowed to sit on a horse!

23:26.972 --> 23:31.042
They're unstable and
they're vicious creatures.

23:40.952 --> 23:45.390
I think, Sir Benjamin, it might be an
appropriate moment for me to retire.

23:47.559 --> 23:48.627
Take care!

23:50.395 --> 23:52.664
Come, Maria.

23:52.831 --> 23:54.132
Every Merryweather rides.

23:54.866 --> 23:56.301
It's in the blood.

23:56.668 --> 24:01.373
This is Peririco... she's a little
feisty but she's a loyal stead.

24:01.606 --> 24:02.974
Just hold out your hand.

24:04.309 --> 24:05.544
I give you my word,

24:05.977 --> 24:08.346
it'll stay attached to you, Miss.

24:38.410 --> 24:39.945
You see, Miss?

24:40.512 --> 24:41.546
She knows.

24:53.692 --> 24:56.561
- You're getting on well with Peririco...
- Yes, Uncle.

25:03.969 --> 25:05.270
We should be heading back.

25:05.437 --> 25:06.271
It's getting late.

25:11.309 --> 25:15.146
Uncle, I'm really enjoying this.
Could I stay out a little longer?

25:17.048 --> 25:19.818
As long as you promise to stay
within the Moonacre boundary.

25:20.719 --> 25:21.353
Remember...

25:21.786 --> 25:25.290
I can only vouch for your safety
if you stay out of the forest.

25:26.091 --> 25:27.726
I will be home before long,

25:27.792 --> 25:29.995
and Peririco will take good care of me.

25:31.229 --> 25:31.963
Very well.

25:35.734 --> 25:36.568
Goodbye Uncle!

25:49.614 --> 25:52.150
What's so special
about the forest anyway?

26:03.795 --> 26:04.963
You stay here.

26:19.811 --> 26:21.246
Oh, little baby.

26:21.313 --> 26:23.281
Who did this to you?

26:26.751 --> 26:29.721
One catch two captives.

26:30.088 --> 26:31.256
What do you want?

26:34.025 --> 26:36.861
Let's go. Catch an animal that
comes to get you coming to help!

26:37.195 --> 26:37.963
I know who you are!

26:38.330 --> 26:39.965
You're bandits and plunderers!

26:47.339 --> 26:48.306
You!

26:48.740 --> 26:49.941
You're coming with us now!

26:50.308 --> 26:53.578
My father's just dying
to make your acquaintance.

26:57.382 --> 26:58.883
It's the demon dog!

27:12.364 --> 27:14.632
Thank you,
you obedient doggy!

27:16.368 --> 27:17.602
Come on, little one...

27:17.969 --> 27:19.070
Let me take you home.

27:30.749 --> 27:32.550
Robin, it's your father!

27:40.258 --> 27:45.764
What did I do to deserve
such a prize filth for a son?

28:05.116 --> 28:08.086
I hope Peririco gave you an
educational tour of the estate.

28:10.655 --> 28:12.624
I have a wounded hare.

28:13.892 --> 28:17.062
That, young lady,
is a rare Moonacre rabbit.

28:17.595 --> 28:20.498
By far the most beautiful,
brave and serene creature.

28:20.932 --> 28:22.963
And as you've brought
her in from the wild,

28:22.964 --> 28:24.302
she's now your responsibility.

28:25.036 --> 28:26.369
And with your knowledge of animals,

28:26.370 --> 28:28.273
I very much doubt it will
live to see the morning.

28:30.308 --> 28:32.577
Keep out of the forest child!

28:33.912 --> 28:34.546
Maria?

28:36.247 --> 28:37.615
Goodness gracious!

28:38.116 --> 28:38.383
Look at your...

28:39.918 --> 28:40.685
dress!

28:46.057 --> 28:48.026
Maria, there's something
alive on your body!

28:48.660 --> 28:51.296
Miss Heliotrop, please calm down!

28:52.063 --> 28:53.698
This is a Moonacre rabbit...

28:54.666 --> 28:57.736
A beautiful, brave and serene creature.

28:58.570 --> 29:00.004
I intend to look after it.

29:03.875 --> 29:05.710
And I'm going to call her Serena.

29:53.458 --> 29:54.025
Uncle?

29:54.592 --> 29:57.996
I really think you and I
have some matters to discuss.

29:59.397 --> 30:02.000
There are some very strange things
going on in this house.

30:02.267 --> 30:06.304
First off, who always keeps my dress
and leaves the biscuits in my room?

30:07.172 --> 30:08.473
The stars on my ceiling move.

30:08.873 --> 30:10.642
There's a mysterious
white horse outside.

30:11.609 --> 30:14.448
This place is falling apart,
things appear to move,

30:14.449 --> 30:16.414
and the piano plays
music on its own!

30:17.248 --> 30:19.350
I mean, I have never even
seen the kitchen.

30:19.717 --> 30:21.486
So where on earth
does all this food come from?

30:21.786 --> 30:24.222
Do you ever stop asking questions?

30:29.828 --> 30:31.529
Uncle, I...

30:35.867 --> 30:37.168
Sit down, my dear.

30:41.973 --> 30:43.006
Wolf?

30:46.778 --> 30:47.779
Where are we going?

30:58.823 --> 30:59.957
Wolf?

31:02.093 --> 31:02.694
Wolf?

31:04.162 --> 31:04.195
Wolf?!

31:33.224 --> 31:37.128
Marmaduke Scarlet.
Chef of all chefs,

31:38.062 --> 31:40.164
at your service, Little Princess.

31:51.976 --> 31:53.177
How do you do that?

31:53.578 --> 31:55.346
Get me some sherbet, will you?

31:55.813 --> 31:57.181
Chop, chop...

31:59.317 --> 32:01.486
I'm not actually really sure
where your sherbet is...

32:01.653 --> 32:04.622
Never you mind...I'll get it...

32:09.928 --> 32:13.097
Are you the one who leaves
the milk and biscuits for me?

32:18.069 --> 32:22.740
These past few days,
it all comes back to me.

32:41.759 --> 32:44.862
Scarlet please, will you stop
yourself for just one moment?

32:45.863 --> 32:48.800
Surely somebody in this household
must be able to answer my questions.

32:49.233 --> 32:51.502
Dear Princess, a little bit of magic...

32:51.970 --> 32:53.805
has come back to the valley.

32:54.505 --> 32:58.309
You obviously haven't
finished reading the book.

33:00.979 --> 33:01.946
The book?

33:03.748 --> 33:05.350
But my uncle took it
away from me.

33:07.652 --> 33:08.553
In the library,

33:10.355 --> 33:14.993
you'll find a slim volume,
Secret Doors and Private Lockers...

33:15.460 --> 33:16.594
Perhaps a piece of...

33:17.428 --> 33:20.698
stargazer pie for your study.

34:31.735 --> 34:34.772
The Moon Princess truly believed
in the goodness of all.

34:36.206 --> 34:39.377
But the men soon fell to the greed
that was in their heart.

34:40.110 --> 34:43.781
Each desperate to claim
the power of the pearls for himself.

34:47.418 --> 34:49.020
We are the chosen ones!

34:50.188 --> 34:54.458
These pearls stay with
the De Noir clan forever!

34:55.525 --> 34:55.893
Father?

34:56.793 --> 34:57.962
Come! Be with me.

34:58.429 --> 35:01.366
Let Moonacre be your home
and be your family.

35:01.432 --> 35:03.367
Speak true!

35:05.736 --> 35:10.374
With the power of these pearls,
I can claim the valley for myself.

35:11.609 --> 35:12.944
No.

35:13.177 --> 35:17.048
Together, I mean together
we could rule the valley.

35:18.583 --> 35:20.685
These pearls belongs to no man,

35:20.852 --> 35:22.687
they belong to nature!

35:23.621 --> 35:24.822
Give it to me!!

35:25.056 --> 35:26.090
No! Give them to me!!!

35:30.128 --> 35:30.561
No no no!!!

35:30.628 --> 35:32.363
I beg of you... please!!!

35:32.597 --> 35:35.133
You cannot let your heart
be ruled by greed!

35:36.901 --> 35:39.303
Betrayed by those she loved the most,

35:39.504 --> 35:43.107
the Moon Princess unleashed
the power bestowed upon her,

35:43.541 --> 35:46.911
and cast a terrifying
curse over them all.

35:47.879 --> 35:49.213
Hear me!!!!

35:49.614 --> 35:52.049
You've gone against the nature,

35:52.350 --> 35:54.752
and you shall suffer for it!

35:54.952 --> 35:59.257
Nature will wreak her revenge
and put a curse upon this valley.

35:59.557 --> 36:00.424
One day,

36:00.825 --> 36:03.294
a pure heart will walk among you.

36:03.594 --> 36:05.363
If she can't lift the curse,

36:05.796 --> 36:08.933
when the 5000th moon
rises from the sea,

36:09.367 --> 36:14.405
this valley shall be plunged
into eternal darkness!!!!

36:18.342 --> 36:20.244
The moon pearls vanished that day,

36:20.611 --> 36:22.947
and where to find them
remained a secret.

36:23.548 --> 36:26.050
Marmaduke!
The house... the valley... it's all...

36:27.752 --> 36:28.920
- Cursed!

36:30.188 --> 36:31.122
Oh yes!

36:32.690 --> 36:33.991
Take a look around you.

36:35.193 --> 36:38.262
Everything's falling apart.

36:39.964 --> 36:41.766
Ever since that terrible day,

36:42.233 --> 36:45.069
the two families have
been totally consumed

36:45.736 --> 36:46.737
with pride...

36:47.505 --> 36:48.973
and blind hatred.

36:52.710 --> 36:55.613
And the only person
who can break this curse

36:56.414 --> 36:59.183
is a true Moon Princess!

36:59.217 --> 37:00.451
The Moon Princess?

37:01.452 --> 37:02.220
But...

37:02.587 --> 37:04.121
she lived hundreds of years ago.

37:04.355 --> 37:07.391
The legend tells...
of a little white horse,

37:07.758 --> 37:10.428
a mystical companion
to protect her.

37:10.561 --> 37:11.662
A magical creature...

37:12.129 --> 37:15.132
invisible so they say...
to anyone...

37:15.533 --> 37:18.002
except a true Moon Princess.

37:19.570 --> 37:20.571
You mean...

37:21.372 --> 37:24.141
I'm suppose to be this...

37:25.409 --> 37:28.312
I'm supposed to undo this curse?

37:28.479 --> 37:29.847
Everyone knows the legend.

37:30.014 --> 37:32.183
Peace will never be restored...

37:32.383 --> 37:36.220
until the pearls are return to the sea
and the families reunited!

37:36.487 --> 37:38.256
This is all madness!

37:41.692 --> 37:45.129
Time is slipping away.

37:45.429 --> 37:47.298
the 5,000th moon...

37:47.531 --> 37:49.100
to set it right.

37:50.701 --> 37:54.472
Stop! Stop...
I don't want to hear another word!

37:54.705 --> 37:56.007
You are all insane!!

38:03.247 --> 38:08.419
Three hundred and eighty-four years...

38:10.988 --> 38:15.593
times thirteen for the moon's per annum.

38:17.194 --> 38:18.529
Plus...

38:22.667 --> 38:25.102
seven moons for this year.

38:26.637 --> 38:27.938
That's...

38:31.475 --> 38:33.344
That makes...

38:35.713 --> 38:38.149
four thousand nine hundred
and ninety-nine.

38:39.517 --> 38:43.654
Oh Serena, the very next moon's
arrival will be the 5,000th moon.

38:45.890 --> 38:47.525
Everyone knows the legend...

38:47.892 --> 38:49.694
These pearls belongs to no man...

38:50.027 --> 38:51.062
They belong to nature!

38:51.228 --> 38:53.931
5,000 moons to set it right!!

38:54.632 --> 38:57.868
You're a Merryweather...

38:57.902 --> 38:59.904
You're the chosen one!

39:05.343 --> 39:07.211
Keep out of the forest child!

39:25.930 --> 39:28.432
I've to get out of this
remote place, Serena!

39:28.532 --> 39:31.168
I don't want anything more
to do with this!

39:33.237 --> 39:35.773
Miss Heliotrope
will take good care of you.

39:59.029 --> 40:00.498
Maria....

40:05.736 --> 40:07.471
Maria...

40:23.220 --> 40:24.388
Who are you?

40:32.797 --> 40:36.333
You look...
just like the lady in the painting.

40:37.635 --> 40:39.170
Come along.

40:49.447 --> 40:51.015
Oh, do come in!!

40:58.889 --> 41:00.424
You naughty hedgehog!

41:00.658 --> 41:03.060
In my favorite chair again!

41:03.894 --> 41:05.629
You cheeky monkey!

41:10.868 --> 41:12.002
Be nice and still,

41:12.169 --> 41:14.071
don't make any sudden movement.

41:14.305 --> 41:15.840
Then she won't be so scared!

41:16.373 --> 41:17.641
I will try!

41:18.576 --> 41:20.644
Oh! I was talking to the snake.

41:22.446 --> 41:25.616
I rescued as many
injured creatures as I can.

41:29.153 --> 41:30.517
And did you do the embroidery

41:30.518 --> 41:32.823
and brought all those
strange dresses in my room?

41:32.990 --> 41:34.291
Yes.

41:36.961 --> 41:38.429
My name is Loveday.

41:50.941 --> 42:10.551
Our time is nearly spent right here...
the moon shall not be our forever.

42:17.501 --> 42:19.373
You saw something,
didn't you?

42:19.374 --> 42:21.305
Didn't you?
Tell me what you saw.

42:21.338 --> 42:22.506
I have to leave!

42:22.606 --> 42:24.124
No no no no...

42:24.159 --> 42:25.643
Stay with me!

42:26.443 --> 42:27.978
I've frightened you, haven't I?

42:28.145 --> 42:30.648
You see,
I'm not used to visitors.

42:30.981 --> 42:33.183
And I do so much just
want to be your friend.

42:34.018 --> 42:36.387
It's no use you know...
your father...

42:36.687 --> 42:38.522
he tried to run away too.

42:38.789 --> 42:40.024
But there is nowhere to hide.

42:40.457 --> 42:43.093
He sent you here
because he loved you.

42:43.294 --> 42:45.863
Because Moonacre
is where you belong.

42:49.900 --> 42:51.468
You and I are the same.

42:54.004 --> 42:55.372
Except...

42:56.540 --> 42:57.741
Except?

42:59.176 --> 43:02.379
Where I failed,
you might succeed.

43:03.280 --> 43:06.650
What about my uncle?
Sir Benjamin... can't he help?

43:07.318 --> 43:11.055
Never, ever mention that man to me again,
do you understand?

43:13.691 --> 43:15.559
Your past is behind you.

43:16.727 --> 43:19.730
Your future awaits you
if you want it.

43:20.531 --> 43:21.966
You decide.

43:22.900 --> 43:24.301
I want to help.

43:24.535 --> 43:27.171
I just don't know what
I'm supposed to do to begin.

43:27.438 --> 43:28.872
Find the pearls!

43:29.073 --> 43:30.641
Nobody knows where they are.

43:30.874 --> 43:33.210
Each family blames the other
for taking them.

43:36.380 --> 43:37.881
They are both to blame.

43:38.549 --> 43:41.785
The De Noir took the casket
then we must have the key.

43:52.429 --> 43:53.564
The key!

44:05.676 --> 44:06.644
Now for the casket.

44:06.710 --> 44:08.345
You have to take me there.

44:08.479 --> 44:10.614
- Where?
- To De Noir.

44:10.881 --> 44:12.650
You've to take me
to where they live.

44:23.694 --> 44:25.295
There it is!

44:27.798 --> 44:30.267
Loveday...
are you alright?

44:31.969 --> 44:35.205
I'm sorry!
I can never go back there!

44:38.809 --> 44:40.010
Loveday!

44:40.711 --> 44:41.745
Loveday!

46:19.409 --> 46:21.845
Father, I could pad and place a scythe
and nail it under their roof.

46:22.312 --> 46:25.582
Don't go near Moonacre...
that house is damned!

46:26.049 --> 46:28.185
No...
the word is...

46:28.752 --> 46:31.622
she is about to meet her downfall.

46:46.937 --> 46:50.440
How kind of you to join us,
Moon Princess.

46:54.745 --> 46:57.080
Oh...
Oh, and what is this?

46:57.981 --> 47:01.385
She has brought us
the lost key, gentlemen!

47:02.386 --> 47:06.374
Wasn't it terrible of the De Noir
to have the moon pearls

47:06.375 --> 47:09.193
hidden up here all the time...
haven't we?

47:09.860 --> 47:11.829
Well, it's true isn't it?

47:11.929 --> 47:13.864
Your ancestors stole them!

47:14.031 --> 47:15.933
My ancestors?!

47:17.067 --> 47:19.403
Well, perhaps Princess...

47:19.937 --> 47:21.905
I should introduce you...

47:25.209 --> 47:29.580
Maria Merryweather...
the last Moon Princess.

47:30.480 --> 47:31.682
Sir William.

47:33.183 --> 47:36.153
The very first De Noir.

47:42.826 --> 47:44.228
The pearls casket!

47:44.528 --> 47:48.699
And you so very kindly
brought us the key.

47:56.173 --> 47:57.241
You've hidden them!!

47:57.541 --> 48:00.210
They were never there, girl!

48:00.878 --> 48:04.114
Your filthy Merryweather family
took them!

48:04.615 --> 48:07.985
Before he...
picked up the box!

48:08.051 --> 48:10.120
They stole the pearls.

48:11.221 --> 48:13.023
But soon...

48:13.257 --> 48:15.859
the final moon will rise...

48:16.260 --> 48:19.897
and the thieving Merryweathers
will be punished!

48:21.098 --> 48:23.700
I'm glad that we have you here.

48:24.067 --> 48:26.770
There's nothing anyone can do to stop it!

48:27.304 --> 48:31.208
At last the entire valley will be ours!

48:32.609 --> 48:37.481
And the De Noir will finally
feast upon revenge!!

48:52.629 --> 48:54.464
Leave me alone, you ogre!

48:55.365 --> 48:57.265
You know,
for someone in your predicament,

48:57.266 --> 48:58.502
I have to admire your spirit!

49:04.541 --> 49:05.175
Witch!

49:08.211 --> 49:09.513
Hey!
Lock her in!

49:10.847 --> 49:13.350
Welcome to your new house!!

49:13.650 --> 49:15.552
Hope you make friends
with the roaches!

49:20.023 --> 49:22.225
Guard, watch her...
she's slippery.

49:55.392 --> 49:57.527
Where is that girl?

49:57.928 --> 49:58.996
Unbelievable!

50:07.771 --> 50:08.972
Absolutely irresponsible!

51:07.731 --> 51:09.633
Oh, this dress!

51:40.163 --> 51:42.065
Come back here, you witch!!!

51:43.100 --> 51:44.067
The girl has escaped!

52:04.988 --> 52:06.323
Princess!

52:08.391 --> 52:09.526
What're you going to do now?

52:32.215 --> 52:34.551
She won't find her way
out of the forest.

52:49.933 --> 52:52.736
- She can't have come this far...
- Let's try north!

53:22.465 --> 53:23.700
Go Robin, find her!

53:28.772 --> 53:30.440
I want her killed!

53:31.775 --> 53:33.843
I want her to stop the curse.

53:34.311 --> 53:37.881
Their death is our victory!

53:39.616 --> 53:42.252
Stupid girl...
should have stayed where you were.

54:05.742 --> 54:06.610
Robin!

54:33.670 --> 54:34.337
This way!

54:42.112 --> 54:43.813
Oh... Wolf!!

54:48.952 --> 54:51.621
Quickly!
Can you find the way home?

55:02.332 --> 55:06.102
That demon dog
can't protect you forever!

55:17.614 --> 55:19.883
Now that be Miss Maria home, sir.

55:22.552 --> 55:23.720
Uncle Benjamin...
Miss Heliotrop!

55:24.988 --> 55:25.922
I'm really sorry!

55:29.192 --> 55:30.627
Where are your...
where are...

55:31.394 --> 55:32.329
Miss Heliotrop!

55:33.063 --> 55:33.863
Miss Heliotrop!

55:34.831 --> 55:36.066
I'm perfectly alright...
yes.

55:36.966 --> 55:39.402
But what happened
to your clothes, my dear one?

55:40.136 --> 55:43.273
How dare you come home
in this manner and at this hour?

55:44.107 --> 55:46.176
I'm sorry but you don't
know what happened, I was...

55:46.509 --> 55:48.778
I was...
in the forest and...

55:49.312 --> 55:50.246
In the forest?

55:50.613 --> 55:52.481
Didn't I expressively forbid
you to go to the forest?

55:52.482 --> 55:52.949
Yes.

55:53.450 --> 55:55.819
But... listen,
I've so much to tell you!

55:56.419 --> 55:58.521
Go upstairs this instance
and tidy yourself up!

55:59.589 --> 55:59.856
But...

56:00.056 --> 56:01.491
Just do as you're told!

56:06.663 --> 56:09.833
You're not my father!

56:23.646 --> 56:24.180
Maria!

56:25.181 --> 56:26.383
Maria, open this door!

56:28.351 --> 56:29.352
Listen...

56:30.787 --> 56:35.258
It maybe possible...
that I was... a little rough earlier.

56:35.425 --> 56:37.861
The point is you were gone
for such a long time.

56:38.395 --> 56:40.230
I mean you didn't even tell us!

56:40.830 --> 56:41.364
I...

56:41.798 --> 56:42.665
We!

56:42.932 --> 56:46.002
Miss Heliotrop was
beside herself with worry.

56:50.073 --> 56:51.241
Maria...

56:58.648 --> 56:59.816
I know that...

57:01.050 --> 57:06.423
given that women and I
normally don't see eye to eye...

57:10.460 --> 57:12.529
It wouldn't be untrue to say...

57:14.931 --> 57:16.866
I'm glad that you're back.

57:27.477 --> 57:29.446
Who put this back on the wall?!

57:30.980 --> 57:34.017
Digweed? Digweed!!
Come and take this away!

57:47.096 --> 57:50.467
Seems that there won't be
any stars left tonight, Serena.

57:54.370 --> 57:57.106
The Moon is getting closer and closer.

57:58.374 --> 58:00.143
What're we going to do?

58:39.215 --> 58:40.884
How could you
leave me like that?!

58:41.217 --> 58:42.952
In the forest.

58:44.587 --> 58:47.757
This belongs to the
first ever Moon Princess.

58:49.559 --> 58:51.094
Forgive me?

59:02.772 --> 59:05.241
Fits you like a glove!

59:08.611 --> 59:10.547
Oh Loveday, this is all hopeless.

59:10.914 --> 59:12.148
What?

59:12.315 --> 59:15.218
I'm as far away from actually
finding the pearls as ever.

59:15.919 --> 59:18.087
Perhaps it's here somewhere...
hidden.

59:22.592 --> 59:24.360
Come on, come with me.

59:24.661 --> 59:25.695
Where?

59:26.129 --> 59:29.532
Downstairs?
Oh no no, I'm not going downstairs.

01:01:14.937 --> 01:01:16.406
Isn't it bad luck for the groom
to see the dress?

01:01:16.739 --> 01:01:19.642
I wanted you to see me
just as I am before the wedding.

01:01:19.909 --> 01:01:21.344
And what does that mean?

01:01:30.553 --> 01:01:32.088
Benjamin.

01:01:32.889 --> 01:01:34.524
I have to tell you something.

01:01:35.091 --> 01:01:37.460
Something I should've told you
a long, long time ago.

01:01:39.062 --> 01:01:42.365
My darling...
what ever is it?... Hmm?

01:01:43.266 --> 01:01:44.934
I am not who you think I am.

01:01:48.104 --> 01:01:49.405
I'm a De Noir.

01:01:50.473 --> 01:01:51.340
A De Noir?

01:01:51.908 --> 01:01:53.893
I was brought up to
despise the Merryweathers,

01:01:53.894 --> 01:01:55.878
but later then I met you and
that changed everything.

01:01:57.413 --> 01:01:58.047
You tricked me!

01:01:58.314 --> 01:01:58.881
No!

01:02:00.850 --> 01:02:02.585
You pretended to love me!

01:02:02.652 --> 01:02:03.118
No!

01:02:03.119 --> 01:02:05.388
And all these times you
were plotting behind my back,

01:02:05.389 --> 01:02:07.657
trying to find those
ridiculous pearls.

01:02:15.798 --> 01:02:18.367
It was your father that sent you,
wasn't it?

01:02:18.468 --> 01:02:19.302
No.

01:02:19.535 --> 01:02:21.904
By marrying you,
I lost his love forever.

01:02:22.071 --> 01:02:23.673
But Benjamin,
don't you see?

01:02:24.073 --> 01:02:26.909
Our love could bring
our families back together!

01:02:27.143 --> 01:02:29.011
Can put an end to
this dreadful curse!

01:02:29.746 --> 01:02:31.447
Curse.
No, don't give me that nonsense!!

01:02:32.582 --> 01:02:35.818
And you filled this house
with your De Noir flowers!!

01:02:35.952 --> 01:02:37.987
No no please...
you don't understand.

01:02:38.187 --> 01:02:40.123
Doesn't love change everything?

01:02:41.157 --> 01:02:42.859
No... my dear...

01:02:43.693 --> 01:02:45.094
but hate does.

01:03:10.386 --> 01:03:11.387
So...

01:03:12.188 --> 01:03:14.924
you missed your chance
to bring the families together.

01:03:19.028 --> 01:03:21.898
He broke my heart.

01:03:25.501 --> 01:03:27.904
I think he broke his heart too.

01:03:28.304 --> 01:03:30.773
But he let me be lost forever.

01:03:32.475 --> 01:03:34.777
It must have been
quite a shock for him.

01:03:36.145 --> 01:03:37.013
I mean,

01:03:38.347 --> 01:03:40.983
maybe if you've waited
for him to calm down.

01:03:41.317 --> 01:03:42.251
Perhaps apologize?

01:03:42.652 --> 01:03:44.387
Oh, me apologize?!

01:03:51.327 --> 01:03:53.629
You don't understand, do you?

01:03:53.830 --> 01:03:56.232
I'm starting
to understand one thing.

01:03:57.099 --> 01:03:58.968
The real curse of this valley...

01:03:59.302 --> 01:04:00.736
is pride!

01:04:05.975 --> 01:04:06.976
Digweed, stop!

01:04:11.013 --> 01:04:14.417
But that'll be the master wishes!
I'll be back.

01:04:22.525 --> 01:04:23.793
Exactly!

01:04:23.893 --> 01:04:26.229
Miss Maria,
tell me more about this curse!

01:04:31.901 --> 01:04:33.603
There she is.

01:04:34.337 --> 01:04:36.973
Each time when
a new Moon Princess arrives,

01:04:37.707 --> 01:04:38.875
so does this picture.

01:04:39.475 --> 01:04:42.211
But look at it...
look at it!

01:04:45.314 --> 01:04:47.617
Digweed...
you can move now...

01:04:49.118 --> 01:04:50.653
Oh...
thank goodness!

01:05:12.008 --> 01:05:13.843
Can't you see?!

01:05:14.010 --> 01:05:14.944
There, look!

01:05:15.378 --> 01:05:16.579
She's showing us!

01:05:16.913 --> 01:05:18.347
She took the pearls!

01:05:19.749 --> 01:05:20.082
Maria...

01:05:20.349 --> 01:05:21.684
are you telling us...

01:05:21.817 --> 01:05:24.253
that the Moon Princess herself
took the Moon pearls?!

01:05:24.987 --> 01:05:26.489
Yes!

01:05:26.856 --> 01:05:28.991
Yes, and she's showing me
where she hid them!

01:05:29.959 --> 01:05:32.595
But where?
Where did she put them?

01:05:33.129 --> 01:05:35.898
They're in the trees somewhere...
out in the forest.

01:05:36.165 --> 01:05:36.766
Well, that's a help.

01:05:36.999 --> 01:05:38.200
No, I saw that it was nearby.

01:05:38.834 --> 01:05:40.703
I think I'll know it
again if I saw it.

01:05:41.671 --> 01:05:42.905
Hmm, what?

01:05:44.974 --> 01:05:45.975
What?

01:05:46.208 --> 01:05:49.745
There's only one person
who has walked the woods his whole life.

01:05:50.346 --> 01:05:53.282
Someone who has it in his blood.

01:05:54.784 --> 01:05:55.918
Robin?!

01:05:56.185 --> 01:05:57.053
Impossible!

01:05:57.219 --> 01:05:58.854
He's an arrogant so and so!

01:05:59.455 --> 01:06:01.457
I never ever want
to see him again!

01:06:02.158 --> 01:06:03.659
It's a point of honor.

01:06:04.460 --> 01:06:05.361
It's a matter of...

01:06:05.628 --> 01:06:06.495
Pride?!

01:06:25.514 --> 01:06:27.083
Good luck, little Princess!!!

01:06:27.516 --> 01:06:28.651
Bye!

01:06:30.419 --> 01:06:31.821
Wait... wait...

01:06:31.988 --> 01:06:33.489
No, Miss Heliotrop.

01:06:34.156 --> 01:06:35.858
No, you won't stop me!

01:06:36.292 --> 01:06:38.494
This is my home and
I'm going to fight for it!

01:06:38.661 --> 01:06:41.430
No, no no...
I know you've got to do this.

01:06:42.865 --> 01:06:45.267
I'm beginning to understand a little.

01:06:46.335 --> 01:06:47.970
I believe in you!

01:06:51.474 --> 01:06:53.576
- Bye...
- Bye, Miss.

01:06:57.213 --> 01:06:58.180
But be careful!

01:06:58.314 --> 01:06:59.382
I will!

01:07:03.352 --> 01:07:05.254
That will be the post, sir...

01:07:16.432 --> 01:07:17.266
Loveday?

01:07:54.103 --> 01:07:55.971
Princess!

01:07:56.672 --> 01:07:58.274
Giving yourself up?!
How good of you?

01:08:07.083 --> 01:08:09.168
The grand trapper...
trapped!

01:08:09.203 --> 01:08:11.253
Let me down,
you little witch!!

01:08:11.620 --> 01:08:12.655
Certainly...

01:08:12.955 --> 01:08:14.657
No no no, no don't you dare!!

01:08:17.225 --> 01:08:18.327
Oh... my foot.

01:08:20.796 --> 01:08:22.765
Thank you darling Serena.

01:08:23.332 --> 01:08:24.466
Off you go.

01:08:24.700 --> 01:08:25.401
Please!

01:08:29.772 --> 01:08:31.040
Wait!

01:08:31.407 --> 01:08:33.843
I'm really swelling,
I can feel my head hurting!

01:08:35.010 --> 01:08:37.546
Oh no...
it was like that before...

01:08:38.346 --> 01:08:41.984
- I would let you down if you do one thing for me.
- What?

01:08:42.184 --> 01:08:43.652
Just promise you'll listen!

01:08:44.787 --> 01:08:45.688
Say "I promise"!

01:08:46.889 --> 01:08:48.057
Just say it!

01:08:48.256 --> 01:08:49.524
I promise!

01:08:50.225 --> 01:08:51.827
Alright, you beat me,
let me down!

01:08:51.993 --> 01:08:52.895
Very well...

01:09:01.670 --> 01:09:03.205
What about him?

01:09:05.174 --> 01:09:06.542
You're a De Noir...

01:09:07.776 --> 01:09:10.045
he very probably will hurt you.

01:09:16.118 --> 01:09:17.219
I'm listening.

01:09:33.269 --> 01:09:34.770
Miss De Noir.

01:09:35.037 --> 01:09:36.337
Sir Benjamin.

01:09:44.212 --> 01:09:46.615
- Well...
- Well...

01:09:52.087 --> 01:09:53.288
Benjamin?

01:09:54.790 --> 01:09:55.724
I'm here.

01:09:59.461 --> 01:10:02.698
- I believe apologies are in order.
- Yes, they are.

01:10:02.865 --> 01:10:06.769
After all, one's behaviour have not been...
as it might.

01:10:06.936 --> 01:10:08.871
That's right.

01:10:14.743 --> 01:10:15.578
I'm sorry.

01:10:15.744 --> 01:10:16.912
Yes, you should be.

01:10:18.347 --> 01:10:19.415
Beg your pardon?

01:10:20.783 --> 01:10:22.751
It shall be easy to forgive you,
but...

01:10:22.985 --> 01:10:23.986
Forgive me?!

01:10:24.587 --> 01:10:25.821
What on earth
are you talking about?

01:10:26.789 --> 01:10:29.491
Don't play games with me,
Benjamin Merryweather!

01:10:29.658 --> 01:10:31.093
You asked me here!

01:10:31.627 --> 01:10:34.628
- It was you who asked to see me!
- What!

01:10:46.775 --> 01:10:48.043
Maria.

01:10:48.344 --> 01:10:49.345
Maria.

01:10:50.179 --> 01:10:51.880
Where the devil is that girl?

01:10:52.348 --> 01:10:54.083
- Goodbye!
- Robin, please!

01:10:56.118 --> 01:10:57.786
I promised I'll listen to you,

01:10:58.554 --> 01:10:59.488
and I have!

01:11:00.990 --> 01:11:02.858
Robin, you've to help me,
you have to!!

01:11:03.225 --> 01:11:05.294
You are a Merryweather!

01:11:09.098 --> 01:11:13.135
- Right now I want to kill you.
- Kill me and the whole valley dies with me.

01:11:13.569 --> 01:11:16.438
You and I can solve it
and we only have until moon rise.

01:11:17.439 --> 01:11:18.540
Tonight!

01:11:19.108 --> 01:11:20.542
I'm still listening.

01:11:26.248 --> 01:11:27.916
She's back in the forest,

01:11:28.751 --> 01:11:29.752
and this time...

01:11:30.719 --> 01:11:32.554
she won't be leaving.

01:11:37.059 --> 01:11:40.696
They are armed men out there
whose express aim it is to do her harm!

01:11:43.032 --> 01:11:44.900
I would have never agreed.

01:11:47.303 --> 01:11:49.505
I didn't know, you see.

01:11:50.139 --> 01:11:51.273
I must go to her.

01:11:51.573 --> 01:11:54.443
Oh, don't be a fool. I'll go.
I know the forest.

01:11:54.944 --> 01:11:55.944
Wait!

01:11:57.246 --> 01:11:58.280
If you'll forgive me...

01:11:58.414 --> 01:12:01.617
I believe I know exactly
where Maria will be.

01:12:01.650 --> 01:12:03.385
- You do?
- How do you?

01:12:03.619 --> 01:12:05.621
I'm a superb chef, madame,

01:12:06.055 --> 01:12:09.491
it follows that I should possess
a truly superb nose.

01:12:09.792 --> 01:12:13.529
In my youth, when I
would roam those woods,

01:12:13.530 --> 01:12:16.332
I could track anything that moved.

01:12:18.067 --> 01:12:20.102
Plus she told me where
she was going.

01:12:30.779 --> 01:12:31.647
What was that?

01:12:32.147 --> 01:12:33.215
False trails...

01:12:34.049 --> 01:12:36.418
What were you doing with
one of my ribbons in your pocket?

01:12:39.321 --> 01:12:42.224
There are in the trees,
that is very distinctive...

01:12:42.358 --> 01:12:45.861
It has massive roots
twisting around a big dark color.

01:12:46.328 --> 01:12:47.262
I know where that is.

01:12:50.265 --> 01:12:52.935
Suppose for a moment,
I do this to help you out.

01:12:53.102 --> 01:12:56.805
And suppose we actually manage
to find the pearls... what then?

01:12:58.273 --> 01:13:00.042
Well... we...

01:13:00.109 --> 01:13:02.244
return the pearls to the sea
and then we go.

01:13:02.311 --> 01:13:03.645
You know my father
is coming after you?

01:13:04.012 --> 01:13:06.882
It's just a matter of finding
them before he finds me.

01:13:10.819 --> 01:13:12.937
Miss De Noir, it's highly
dangerous out there,

01:13:12.938 --> 01:13:14.289
this is no mission for a woman!

01:13:14.656 --> 01:13:17.226
Perhaps you should have
told that to Maria.

01:13:17.426 --> 01:13:18.560
As a matter of fact I did.

01:13:19.294 --> 01:13:19.895
Frequently...

01:13:20.129 --> 01:13:20.829
Wait!!

01:13:23.732 --> 01:13:25.868
That will be another
female for the party.

01:13:26.135 --> 01:13:28.704
Madame... you're not required
on this expedition.

01:13:40.516 --> 01:13:41.884
Oh... that's better!

01:13:42.251 --> 01:13:44.386
- That'll be your wind...
- Enough... Digweed...

01:13:46.355 --> 01:13:48.724
I've been taking care of Maria
since she was a baby.

01:13:49.091 --> 01:13:50.793
And I intend to protect her now!

01:13:59.301 --> 01:14:01.136
I know which way to go!

01:14:04.273 --> 01:14:05.140
Come on!

01:14:13.449 --> 01:14:14.016
Marmaduke?

01:14:19.021 --> 01:14:21.490
Marmaduke, you blithering ex-hunter,
what are you doing?

01:14:22.991 --> 01:14:24.626
Sorry, sir...

01:14:27.129 --> 01:14:31.733
It appears... my power's out here...
are not what they are in the kitchen.

01:14:31.767 --> 01:14:34.002
Just show us where to go,
would you?!

01:14:44.546 --> 01:14:46.982
I notice the house is falling down.

01:14:47.349 --> 01:14:50.152
Sad to see the place
is in such a state of disrepair.

01:14:50.519 --> 01:14:52.988
If you're so fond of it,
why did you run away from it?

01:14:53.755 --> 01:14:57.125
You took everything I held dearly
and ripped it away from me.

01:14:58.060 --> 01:14:59.061
How could I stay?

01:15:01.296 --> 01:15:02.464
Run far, did you?

01:15:03.432 --> 01:15:05.067
No, not very far...

01:15:05.434 --> 01:15:07.402
But then you never came
to look for me, did you?

01:15:12.975 --> 01:15:18.580
He spent months on horseback,
scouted the entire county, searching for you.

01:15:19.715 --> 01:15:20.616
Marmaduke?

01:15:21.049 --> 01:15:24.751
- Are you leading this expedition or not?
- Yes, sir. Yes.

01:15:28.190 --> 01:15:29.024
Hum... strawberry.

01:15:32.060 --> 01:15:32.961
This way!

01:15:33.829 --> 01:15:37.361
I think we might have a
greater chance of finding her

01:15:37.362 --> 01:15:40.435
if we divide and spread
the arc a little wider.

01:15:46.875 --> 01:15:49.360
It should be clear over the
next hill... we're not far now.

01:15:49.361 --> 01:15:50.045
Wolf!

01:15:53.982 --> 01:15:54.983
Wolf!!!

01:15:58.654 --> 01:15:59.454
Wolf?

01:16:01.623 --> 01:16:02.324
Robin?

01:16:10.232 --> 01:16:11.199
Robin?!

01:16:18.974 --> 01:16:19.841
Wolf?

01:16:21.910 --> 01:16:22.945
Wolf...

01:16:26.014 --> 01:16:26.982
Wolf!!

01:16:28.750 --> 01:16:30.152
Let's go boy!

01:16:55.077 --> 01:16:56.411
Oh, this is pretty.

01:16:58.213 --> 01:17:01.283
Isn't it enough for one
member of my family to betray me.

01:17:01.617 --> 01:17:05.020
Now I find the half-brother
is a traitor too?

01:17:05.454 --> 01:17:12.561
I will take care of this Princess...
myself... once and for all!

01:17:18.567 --> 01:17:19.568
Wolf?

01:18:13.021 --> 01:18:14.389
This is the place!

01:18:27.302 --> 01:18:28.270
Where are the pearls?!

01:18:29.337 --> 01:18:32.607
Listen!
The moon will kill us all!

01:18:43.885 --> 01:18:45.253
Wolf, we have to find Maria!

01:18:50.992 --> 01:18:52.060
Wolf!!

01:19:16.618 --> 01:19:18.920
You!
How could you betray me like that?!

01:19:23.158 --> 01:19:24.493
I will not let you take her, father.

01:19:24.693 --> 01:19:26.061
Put the knife down, boy.

01:19:26.428 --> 01:19:29.631
Father, please, you have to listen
to what Maria has to say!

01:19:30.232 --> 01:19:32.601
Traitor!
You're nothing to me now.

01:19:34.770 --> 01:19:35.937
Go!

01:19:37.272 --> 01:19:39.574
I know where to find you again!

01:19:41.543 --> 01:19:43.945
Back to where it all began.

01:20:00.896 --> 01:20:01.930
In here.

01:20:20.048 --> 01:20:20.816
Where did they go?

01:20:27.189 --> 01:20:29.457
Robin, look at this!

01:21:08.730 --> 01:21:09.831
Where are they?

01:21:18.974 --> 01:21:20.442
It's her. It must be.

01:21:24.145 --> 01:21:25.947
Where... where did you put them?

01:22:05.153 --> 01:22:06.488
The pearls!

01:22:10.058 --> 01:22:10.926
Open the door!

01:22:11.660 --> 01:22:13.061
Robin, let's go!

01:22:30.912 --> 01:22:32.414
It's so dark here.

01:22:32.981 --> 01:22:36.685
Moon pearls... we need your power now...
show us the way!

01:22:59.874 --> 01:23:02.978
Suddenly seems...
very quiet...

01:23:03.345 --> 01:23:05.814
That will be the absence
of the ladies then, sir.

01:23:14.222 --> 01:23:16.257
Sir Benjamin!!

01:23:21.863 --> 01:23:23.498
We're lost!

01:23:38.013 --> 01:23:38.413
Maria!

01:23:38.613 --> 01:23:40.181
Robin, come on!

01:23:44.319 --> 01:23:45.653
Don't you see?

01:23:46.221 --> 01:23:48.023
She's showing us the way!

01:24:13.848 --> 01:24:15.417
De Noir!

01:24:17.218 --> 01:24:18.620
Merryweather!

01:24:20.588 --> 01:24:21.689
Good evening!

01:24:22.857 --> 01:24:25.427
Your niece has failed!

01:24:26.861 --> 01:24:29.764
If you harm, hurt her...
in any way...

01:24:31.866 --> 01:24:32.767
Stop!

01:24:34.069 --> 01:24:36.471
- Uncle, No! No!
- Father, we got them!!

01:24:37.105 --> 01:24:37.539
Look!

01:24:37.939 --> 01:24:38.807
Give me the pearls!

01:24:38.973 --> 01:24:42.343
Those damn pearls!
They brought nothing but harm and grief!

01:24:42.777 --> 01:24:47.816
No, Uncle... it's not the pearls but the greed
in our heart which brings us such misery.

01:24:48.316 --> 01:24:49.384
Father!

01:24:53.488 --> 01:24:56.124
Why do you have so much
hatred in your heart?

01:24:56.991 --> 01:24:58.526
My daughter!

01:25:03.431 --> 01:25:07.302
Don't you want to be free
of this darkness imprisoning you?

01:25:07.735 --> 01:25:10.238
It is he! It is he!

01:25:10.438 --> 01:25:11.372
Father!

01:25:12.507 --> 01:25:13.608
Benjamin!

01:25:21.916 --> 01:25:23.685
Look!

01:25:24.018 --> 01:25:27.388
The 5,000th moon.
The curse is coming true!

01:25:27.822 --> 01:25:32.060
If you can sacrifice your pride,
we can save our families.

01:25:32.527 --> 01:25:34.529
We can save the valley!

01:25:35.196 --> 01:25:36.064
You first.

01:25:36.331 --> 01:25:38.433
No, no... after you.

01:25:40.869 --> 01:25:42.737
I must do this myself!

01:25:57.519 --> 01:25:59.387
At the 5,000th moon,

01:25:59.487 --> 01:25:59.921
I,

01:26:00.555 --> 01:26:03.658
Maria Merryweather,
Moon Princess of Moonacre...

01:26:04.359 --> 01:26:06.928
do remove the curse
that has darkened this valley.

01:26:07.095 --> 01:26:09.464
Take back what is yours!

01:27:01.916 --> 01:27:02.817
No!

01:27:04.118 --> 01:27:05.186
No!

01:29:33.835 --> 01:29:34.068
Maria!

01:29:35.770 --> 01:29:36.904
Maria!

01:29:45.480 --> 01:29:48.182
Oh, my sweet child...
you're alive!

01:29:49.751 --> 01:29:50.985
Uncle!

01:30:22.717 --> 01:30:24.152
Were you worried, Robin?

01:30:24.519 --> 01:30:26.854
No... I could've done that.

01:30:37.498 --> 01:30:39.400
You're the true Moon Princess!

01:30:44.572 --> 01:30:45.306
Oh... nasty!

01:30:45.907 --> 01:30:48.609
That will be a black lion male, sir...

01:30:50.378 --> 01:30:51.512
It's alright, Uncle.

01:30:54.615 --> 01:30:56.050
It's just a Wolf.

01:31:26.347 --> 01:31:28.483
Please forgive my stubborn pride!

01:31:33.187 --> 01:31:33.888
Loveday.

01:31:35.089 --> 01:31:40.493
- Stop right there! I'll finish her right now!
- No, stop... you idiot!

01:31:55.576 --> 01:31:57.979
Maria! I'm here!

01:31:58.779 --> 01:31:59.780
I've come to save you!

01:32:17.498 --> 01:32:19.066
Is there...

01:32:19.667 --> 01:32:21.168
going to be a wedding?

01:32:30.344 --> 01:32:30.711
Oh, my...

01:32:39.153 --> 01:32:40.521
Mr. Digweed?!

01:32:56.304 --> 01:32:58.072
Well, there we are then...

01:32:58.239 --> 01:33:00.107
nothing to be done!

01:36:00.108 --> 01:36:01.108
