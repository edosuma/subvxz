01:21.280 --> 01:24.560
<i>Well, you seem to be alive, Jo.</i>

01:27.600 --> 01:28.640
<i>Just.</i>

01:33.080 --> 01:37.080
<i>What does a girl have to do
to get an ambulance around here?</i>

01:37.160 --> 01:38.160
Jo!

01:39.200 --> 01:40.360
Jo!

01:43.960 --> 01:47.120
Please, Jo!
Please don't leave me, girl!

01:48.880 --> 01:50.880
How long had she been there?

01:50.960 --> 01:54.440
It can't have been long.
Come on, Jo! Please don't leave me!

01:54.520 --> 01:58.080
This is Jo. She's had a serious head
injury and a loss of consciousness.

01:58.160 --> 01:59.600
Let's get her into CT.

02:00.520 --> 02:02.760
Come on, Jo!
Please don't leave me, girl!

02:03.400 --> 02:04.480
Come on, Jo!

02:07.840 --> 02:08.960
Jo!

02:10.840 --> 02:12.600
She's losing consciousness.

02:36.640 --> 02:39.760
How could she hurt herself so badly
just falling down the stairs?

02:39.840 --> 02:42.280
- Could Mum have...
- Don't let her hear you say that!

02:42.360 --> 02:44.360
I'm only saying
what everyone's thinking!

02:44.440 --> 02:45.680
Shut up, Finn!

02:46.240 --> 02:49.920
- I'm gonna get a drink.
- Mum? It's Sash, can you hear me?

02:51.720 --> 02:54.760
She'd been drinking,
which could explain the fall.

02:54.840 --> 02:57.240
What can we expect,
in terms of recovery?

02:58.080 --> 02:59.600
Difficult to say at this stage.

02:59.680 --> 03:02.720
After effects may include
poor concentration, disinhibition...

03:05.960 --> 03:07.320
Finn...

03:13.040 --> 03:14.240
Finn.

03:16.480 --> 03:17.600
Hey!

03:19.040 --> 03:20.120
Hello!

03:21.120 --> 03:22.440
Hello.

03:24.000 --> 03:25.400
Is Finn all right?

03:26.640 --> 03:27.720
He's fine.

03:30.560 --> 03:32.520
You fell down the stairs, Jo.

03:33.040 --> 03:37.280
They put you in an induced coma
to help you recover.

03:37.360 --> 03:39.280
You've been in hospital a week.

03:42.400 --> 03:44.760
Don't tell him to come back home.

03:47.240 --> 03:49.480
Not when he's only just started.

03:51.320 --> 03:52.720
Do you mean Finn?

03:54.480 --> 03:57.560
Well, he went to uni
a year ago, love.

04:07.600 --> 04:09.320
I don't understand.

04:10.520 --> 04:11.640
It was last September.

04:20.920 --> 04:23.800
It's the last thing I remember.

04:23.880 --> 04:25.600
It's okay. It's all right.

04:26.520 --> 04:29.000
It's all right, it'll all come back.

04:29.080 --> 04:30.240
Promise.

04:53.960 --> 04:57.960
It is possible that your wife
will never recover her memories.

04:58.040 --> 05:01.720
I can hear you! It's a curtain,
not a fucking wall!

05:01.800 --> 05:02.720
Jo...

05:04.240 --> 05:06.240
Her disinhibition is
completely normal.

05:06.320 --> 05:09.160
But be warned, it may last some time.

05:09.240 --> 05:11.480
Mrs. Harding, look at you!

05:11.560 --> 05:14.320
Pouring your own drink.
You're on fire!

05:14.400 --> 05:17.560
Yeah, this time tomorrow
I'll be doing your job.

05:20.480 --> 05:22.120
Oh, Rob...

05:22.880 --> 05:24.040
Rob, look at me!

05:24.120 --> 05:26.040
- I'm a fucking mess.
- It's okay.

05:26.120 --> 05:29.320
Your motor skills are improving, Jo.
Which is great.

05:29.400 --> 05:31.120
Let's see how that memory's doing.

05:31.200 --> 05:33.080
Anything new coming back?

05:40.920 --> 05:41.920
No.

05:42.440 --> 05:45.760
The best way to get the memories back
is being around familiar things.

05:45.840 --> 05:47.880
So, I think you're good to go.

05:47.960 --> 05:49.720
We'll see you
at your next appointment.

05:49.800 --> 05:52.880
Any change in your symptoms,
he brings you straight back in.

05:57.600 --> 05:59.480
Are you all right, Mrs. Harding?

06:00.200 --> 06:01.520
Need a hand in there?

06:03.800 --> 06:05.400
Mrs. Harding?

06:06.200 --> 06:10.040
Unbelievable!
He brought skinny jeans!

06:42.480 --> 06:44.480
- Are you smoking again?
- Sorry.

07:03.400 --> 07:06.320
- Are you okay?
- Yeah. Just really, really hot.

07:06.400 --> 07:07.720
Do you want me to stop?

07:09.440 --> 07:11.160
No, no. I just wanna go home.

07:16.440 --> 07:19.320
I still can't believe I dyed my hair.

07:22.440 --> 07:23.640
It suits you.

07:25.360 --> 07:28.280
I just don't understand
how I could be drunk.

07:29.520 --> 07:32.560
Why would I be drunk?
I never get drunk.

07:32.640 --> 07:36.440
That's not strictly true.
You do sometimes.

07:37.040 --> 07:38.240
But not on my own.

07:38.320 --> 07:40.760
You were on your own
when I found you.

07:40.840 --> 07:42.840
I can't find my phone.

07:48.600 --> 07:49.960
You look different.

07:51.000 --> 07:53.600
Get used to you not remembering.
And I've lost weight.

07:53.680 --> 07:55.080
Started swimming again.

07:55.160 --> 07:56.760
With both kids gone.

07:57.400 --> 07:59.800
Swimming and smoking.

08:00.680 --> 08:02.240
- Clever.
- Yep.

08:04.760 --> 08:06.320
Where are your glasses?

08:06.920 --> 08:08.720
I wear contacts now.

08:11.320 --> 08:13.040
Are you having an affair?

08:14.880 --> 08:16.000
No.

08:19.000 --> 08:21.800
- Am I having an affair?
- Bloody hope not.

08:25.920 --> 08:27.240
Fuck, Jobo.

08:28.440 --> 08:29.720
I thought you were dead.

08:31.240 --> 08:33.440
I walked in,
and you were just lying there.

08:33.520 --> 08:35.120
It was the worst moment of my life.

08:38.680 --> 08:40.320
Cos it's all about me.

08:47.840 --> 08:51.320
<i>Jesus, Jo, is this
what you've become?</i>

08:51.400 --> 08:55.040
<i>A lone drunk who can't even manage
a flight of stairs?</i>

09:25.000 --> 09:26.640
Something doesn't feel right.

09:26.720 --> 09:28.720
- What?
- Stop the car.

09:29.320 --> 09:30.920
Please, stop the car!

09:36.720 --> 09:37.840
What is it?

09:39.840 --> 09:42.840
I can't go. I can't go in there.

09:42.920 --> 09:44.160
Okay.

09:44.760 --> 09:46.520
We'll just sit here for a bit.

09:59.280 --> 10:00.280
Okay?

10:19.560 --> 10:20.520
Come on.

10:45.120 --> 10:46.360
Jo, I'm sorry!

10:52.320 --> 10:53.320
Jo...

11:08.920 --> 11:10.000
Get this off.

11:12.400 --> 11:14.080
- Thank you.
- Okay.

11:16.880 --> 11:17.840
Get that.

11:18.920 --> 11:19.880
Yep.

11:29.840 --> 11:31.080
Fuck!

11:31.600 --> 11:33.760
- Sorry. Did it catch you?
- No.

11:33.840 --> 11:36.240
- I'll just...
- Yeah.

11:51.800 --> 11:54.400
<i>What the hell
have you been up to, Jo?</i>

11:56.080 --> 11:59.080
<i>And who have you been up to it with?</i>

12:11.400 --> 12:15.320
- What are you doing?
- The last thing I really remember

12:15.400 --> 12:17.160
is Finn leaving for uni.

12:21.600 --> 12:23.560
I need something tangible.

12:24.760 --> 12:26.360
And I need you to help me.

12:27.880 --> 12:29.880
We could have done it
with a bit of paper!

12:31.600 --> 12:35.240
I've lost a whole year, Rob!

12:47.480 --> 12:51.200
Look who's home!
Holy shit, you've got a crutch!

12:51.280 --> 12:53.200
I... darling.

12:53.280 --> 12:55.600
- Cathy, we've just got back.
- I'm not stopping.

12:55.680 --> 12:57.320
Ella's listening to her music,

12:57.400 --> 13:00.800
so I've literally got till the end
of "Do You Want to Build a Snowman."

13:02.280 --> 13:03.120
Here.

13:06.520 --> 13:08.880
You do remember who I am, don't you?

13:11.720 --> 13:15.800
I've lost 13 months, Cathy,
not 25 years of annoyance.

13:15.880 --> 13:18.760
Just checking!
Rob said you'd gone all Dory on us.

13:18.840 --> 13:20.400
Hey, I didn't say that!

13:21.560 --> 13:24.640
Okay, I'm gonna leave you to it.
Don't stay too long.

13:31.160 --> 13:34.800
So, did we get shit-faced together
the night I fell?

13:36.800 --> 13:37.880
No.

13:39.120 --> 13:42.520
Cos we haven't actually
spoken to each other.

13:43.480 --> 13:44.600
For a while.

13:46.080 --> 13:49.280
We... had an argument.

13:50.200 --> 13:51.160
What?

13:52.560 --> 13:53.800
When?

13:53.880 --> 13:55.520
I can't remember.

13:55.600 --> 14:00.640
- Was around Maytime, I think.
- May?

14:02.480 --> 14:04.440
But that's months ago.

14:06.560 --> 14:09.640
Wow! You must have
really pissed me off.

14:09.720 --> 14:11.240
It was the other way around.

14:12.400 --> 14:17.640
But... can we not talk about it now?
Do you mind?

14:18.960 --> 14:20.520
Can we be friends again?

14:22.160 --> 14:23.400
I've really missed you.

14:26.920 --> 14:29.480
I will remember, though. Eventually.

14:30.320 --> 14:32.920
The doctors are not so sure, but...

14:34.760 --> 14:35.880
I'm going to remember.

14:35.960 --> 14:38.560
Please, she's tired.

14:39.320 --> 14:41.160
I just wanted to see you.

14:42.120 --> 14:44.040
And now I have, so...

14:44.120 --> 14:46.320
Let me find a bit that's not bruised.

14:49.480 --> 14:54.520
I will pop back tomorrow, okay?
So just...

14:54.600 --> 14:57.760
You call me if you need anything.

14:58.320 --> 14:59.560
Night.

15:05.720 --> 15:09.120
- I have to call my dad.
- Your dad is in bed with a cold.

15:09.200 --> 15:10.920
Which is where you should be.

15:12.880 --> 15:14.000
Call him tomorrow.

15:18.240 --> 15:22.520
Perhaps it fell under the cupboard
when I fell down the stairs.

15:22.600 --> 15:25.000
You don't need your phone now.
Come on, bed!

15:27.680 --> 15:28.760
Where's Bobbin?

15:28.840 --> 15:32.600
World of Leather's looking after him
until you get better. Come on, bed!

15:32.680 --> 15:34.520
- Who?
- Wendy.

15:35.080 --> 15:37.040
Jenkins. Our neighbour.

15:37.120 --> 15:39.360
Newish. Well, new to you.

15:40.000 --> 15:42.760
She likes to sit out in the sun,
so we call her...

15:42.840 --> 15:46.640
Anyway, she's a dog lady. Woman.
She likes dogs.

15:46.720 --> 15:49.520
I'll fill you in in the morning,
but let's get some rest.

16:00.400 --> 16:02.040
Is anything coming back?

16:05.360 --> 16:06.440
No.

16:27.160 --> 16:28.120
Rob?

16:29.440 --> 16:30.520
Is that you?

16:46.600 --> 16:47.680
Rob!

16:49.600 --> 16:50.840
What is it?

16:50.920 --> 16:52.520
There's someone in the house.

16:55.040 --> 16:56.320
It's just us!

16:56.400 --> 17:00.200
- No, I saw someone.
- Okay.

17:00.280 --> 17:01.480
I'll go and look.

17:13.760 --> 17:16.760
I've been in every room.
There's no sign of anyone.

17:16.840 --> 17:18.840
All the windows and doors are locked.

17:19.440 --> 17:20.920
There's no one here.

17:22.280 --> 17:25.040
That doctor in ICU said
you'd get confused.

17:25.120 --> 17:27.120
Plus, all the medication you're on...

17:29.400 --> 17:31.800
- Am I going mad?
- No.

17:34.280 --> 17:35.880
You are not going mad.

19:09.000 --> 19:12.640
<i>Yes, you should definitely stick
to translating, Jo.</i>

19:15.400 --> 19:18.600
<i>No wonder you're hiding
your face, little mermaid.</i>

19:25.560 --> 19:27.040
I'll get you a new phone.

19:27.120 --> 19:30.200
I don't want a new one,
I want the old one!

19:31.280 --> 19:33.000
What is all this stuff?

19:33.720 --> 19:37.240
Women from your book group brought
it over while you were in hospital.

19:37.320 --> 19:38.640
Worried I'd starve.

19:45.240 --> 19:46.440
That's Owen.

19:53.960 --> 19:55.240
I miss old Frank.

19:55.920 --> 19:57.000
You wouldn't remember.

19:57.080 --> 20:00.520
We had to put up with him gardening
with his shirt off all summer.

20:09.240 --> 20:13.200
- I'm sure I hated every minute.
- Oh, you really can't remember that?

20:13.280 --> 20:14.160
Really?

20:14.680 --> 20:17.120
I thought once you've seen that,
you can't un-see it.

20:22.160 --> 20:25.440
- Should we make him a drink?
- No, he brings his own.

20:25.520 --> 20:27.400
Tears of a vegan unicorn,

20:27.480 --> 20:30.320
in an environmentally-friendly
water pouch.

20:51.960 --> 20:53.120
How you doing?

20:55.000 --> 20:56.840
Can't get into my computer.

20:58.400 --> 21:00.080
The password doesn't work.

21:00.160 --> 21:03.560
- Well, you might have changed it.
- And I can't get through to my dad.

21:06.040 --> 21:06.960
Hello?

21:08.120 --> 21:09.000
Sorry, Jo.

21:10.720 --> 21:12.320
Yeah, head injury.

21:13.880 --> 21:16.960
Some memory loss, but she'll be okay.

21:18.280 --> 21:19.240
<i>Okay?</i>

21:20.120 --> 21:23.200
<i>You're a long, long way from okay.</i>

22:19.160 --> 22:20.160
Jo!

22:21.520 --> 22:22.920
Christ.

22:26.720 --> 22:28.600
How are you? I heard about your...

22:31.440 --> 22:33.360
I don't remember you.

22:37.800 --> 22:43.800
I don't remember much
of anything last year.

22:48.520 --> 22:51.240
That's... full-on.

22:52.800 --> 22:57.280
I look like my husband beat
the shit out of me, don't I?

23:01.720 --> 23:05.680
I'm sorry, Rob told me your name,
but I've forgotten it.

23:05.760 --> 23:09.680
It's Owen. Should you... be out?

23:10.960 --> 23:12.560
I'm going to see...

23:13.800 --> 23:16.960
I've forgotten her name too,
but she lives down there and she's...

23:17.040 --> 23:19.040
She's looking after my dog. So...

23:19.120 --> 23:22.160
I really think you should
go inside, Jo. It's cold out, and...

23:22.240 --> 23:25.640
- I'll go and get Rob. Yeah?
- I'm fine!

23:27.160 --> 23:28.080
Jo!

23:30.520 --> 23:32.000
Look, Bobbin died.

23:35.360 --> 23:36.680
In January.

23:38.360 --> 23:42.160
You and I buried him together
in the garden. I'm sorry.

23:44.960 --> 23:45.960
He's...

23:48.640 --> 23:51.120
But...

23:51.200 --> 23:52.920
I'm going to fetch him now.

23:54.240 --> 23:55.360
He's with...

23:57.480 --> 23:58.600
Rob said...

24:03.040 --> 24:04.240
He's dead?

24:05.560 --> 24:06.680
What's going on?

24:11.720 --> 24:12.920
What's going on?

24:18.280 --> 24:23.280
Why did you say that lady
was looking after my dog?

24:25.400 --> 24:27.840
Because you'd had a fall.
You'd had a terrible fall.

24:27.920 --> 24:30.440
Stop saying I had a fall!

24:31.480 --> 24:34.560
That's what they say about
old people. "Oh, she had a fall."

24:34.640 --> 24:36.320
I'm not old!

24:38.720 --> 24:41.680
Stop hiding things from me!

24:41.760 --> 24:44.240
You need to calm down.
This isn't like you.

24:44.320 --> 24:47.840
Maybe I changed.
Maybe this is the new me.

24:53.360 --> 24:54.480
Owen...

24:55.680 --> 24:58.840
- Where's he buried?
- He's over there.

25:05.840 --> 25:06.960
Come on, girl.

25:10.160 --> 25:11.800
You're such a liar!

25:21.440 --> 25:22.600
Thank you.

25:28.160 --> 25:30.600
Are we close? You and me?

25:31.640 --> 25:34.320
Well, I have handled your lobelia.

25:35.120 --> 25:36.080
Jo.

25:39.640 --> 25:41.520
I was gonna tell you.

25:41.600 --> 25:43.760
The doctor said to me
you'll recover quicker

25:43.840 --> 25:46.480
if I didn't bombard you,
if you weren't so stressed.

25:47.280 --> 25:48.680
I was gonna tell you.

25:49.720 --> 25:53.880
I just want you to get better, Jo.
I love you. I really love you.

25:53.960 --> 25:56.960
It was stupid. It was stupid of me.

25:58.440 --> 26:00.360
I'm sorry I shouted at you.

26:01.600 --> 26:04.880
I embarrassed you
in front of... what's-his-name.

26:05.960 --> 26:07.800
I'd have shouted at me as well.

26:08.960 --> 26:10.160
I'm sorry.

26:27.960 --> 26:30.760
- Is this my coat?
- Well, it's not mine.

26:43.880 --> 26:45.280
Can you turn that off, please?

26:50.000 --> 26:51.680
Did you just remember something?

26:54.160 --> 26:55.280
Not really.

26:58.720 --> 27:01.680
A trip to the vet, I think.

27:05.800 --> 27:07.400
How did Bobbin die?

27:07.960 --> 27:11.720
He was just too old. He had a problem
with his liver and couldn't...

27:13.240 --> 27:15.840
I'm sorry. I know
how much he meant to you.

27:19.480 --> 27:23.640
Jo, have I done something wrong?
I feel like you're a bit...

27:26.840 --> 27:31.320
We haven't really talked about
what happened the night I fell.

27:33.080 --> 27:34.880
I find that very strange.

27:34.960 --> 27:36.960
It was just a fucking awful accident.

27:37.040 --> 27:39.160
There isn't really
much to talk about.

27:39.240 --> 27:41.120
What was I doing before it?

27:41.200 --> 27:45.080
Like, I still don't understand why
I would have been that drunk.

27:45.160 --> 27:47.920
You're home. That's the point.

27:48.000 --> 27:49.200
You're alive.

27:50.080 --> 27:53.240
And you will recover. That's what
we've got to concentrate on.

27:53.320 --> 27:56.320
- You will recover!
- Okay.

27:57.960 --> 28:00.200
- Mum?
- Sash!

28:00.280 --> 28:01.520
Dad? Hi!

28:02.520 --> 28:03.960
You're upright!

28:07.600 --> 28:11.680
I still can't get used to that hair!

28:11.760 --> 28:15.360
Oh, I know! Yeah, you have
been telling me for months.

28:15.440 --> 28:16.840
I think it looks nice.

28:16.920 --> 28:19.760
- No, it's lovely!
- Yeah.

28:19.840 --> 28:22.960
It's... just different.

28:23.040 --> 28:25.960
- Right? It's different.
- Yes.

28:26.040 --> 28:29.320
I got all your shopping,
and I cooked.

28:29.400 --> 28:30.720
What?

28:32.000 --> 28:33.640
I should hit my head more often.

28:33.720 --> 28:36.840
Well, when I say I cooked,
I mean that I got us a pizza.

28:37.440 --> 28:38.760
Is Finn making an appearance?

28:39.720 --> 28:42.320
No. Of course not. Finn's at uni.

28:47.520 --> 28:49.760
I'm really sorry.
I can't actually stay too long.

28:49.840 --> 28:52.240
I've got to cover
someone's shift at the bar.

28:52.320 --> 28:53.440
The bar?

28:55.200 --> 28:56.760
You're working at a bar now?

28:57.760 --> 28:58.600
Yeah.

29:02.440 --> 29:05.760
In April you helped me move out
of the dreaded bedsit.

29:05.840 --> 29:08.840
Do you remember?
No more sticky carpets.

29:10.120 --> 29:11.200
Okay.

29:11.960 --> 29:13.640
So put it up there.

29:13.720 --> 29:15.040
Really?

29:16.720 --> 29:18.080
Okay.

29:28.960 --> 29:31.680
And in December...

29:33.120 --> 29:35.320
I introduced you to Thomas.

29:38.200 --> 29:40.880
It is so weird
that you don't remember him at all.

29:42.440 --> 29:44.880
Here. I'll show you.

29:46.280 --> 29:47.600
So...

29:56.440 --> 29:58.240
I really love him, Mum.

30:00.000 --> 30:03.120
He's 32, and he works in the bar.

30:05.400 --> 30:08.280
Yeah, he's... There. He's amazing.

30:14.680 --> 30:18.040
- He's really nice. You like him.
- Yeah.

30:18.120 --> 30:20.440
He's everything
we've ever wanted for you.

30:20.520 --> 30:23.040
Actually, he owns the bar
that I work in.

30:23.120 --> 30:24.880
What's your code?

30:24.960 --> 30:27.880
It's 2048. Why, Mum?

30:27.960 --> 30:30.480
Maybe there's something
that can help me...

30:30.560 --> 30:33.440
Can you give it back? There's stuff
I don't want you to see.

30:33.520 --> 30:36.960
- Don't you have any pictures of me?
- I don't know!

30:37.040 --> 30:41.320
I'll see what I can find,
and then I'll e-mail them to you.

30:42.880 --> 30:43.760
Sorry.

30:47.720 --> 30:48.920
I feel like...

30:50.480 --> 30:54.000
the two of you are hiding things
from me.

30:54.080 --> 30:56.000
- No!
- No. That's not the case.

30:56.640 --> 31:01.600
- I can't find my phone anywhere!
- Jo.

31:01.680 --> 31:04.600
My photos! My texts!

31:04.680 --> 31:08.120
- I didn't back anything up!
- Mum.

31:08.200 --> 31:11.320
Okay, look. Here. There. There.

31:12.480 --> 31:15.480
That's a couple that I took of us...

31:17.040 --> 31:21.720
when we went to that open house.
The one with all the sculptures.

31:21.800 --> 31:23.600
We had a really lovely time.

31:41.240 --> 31:44.160
Is it nice up there, Sash,
on your high horse?

31:44.240 --> 31:46.720
I just don't like lying to her.

31:47.400 --> 31:50.320
Look, I told you,
we're not lying to her. We just...

31:51.160 --> 31:54.880
- She doesn't need to know everything.
- All right. Whatever. I've gotta go.

31:56.320 --> 31:57.480
Bye.

31:58.080 --> 31:59.400
Bye! See you.

32:08.200 --> 32:09.440
Hi.

32:10.280 --> 32:13.200
No. No, none the wiser.

32:13.720 --> 32:15.960
Of course, she was drunk.

32:18.160 --> 32:19.160
Well, yeah.

32:19.240 --> 32:23.560
And there's the fact that Dad's been
really worried about her.

32:28.200 --> 32:29.920
Thomas, don't say that!

32:30.000 --> 32:33.680
No. She's not mad enough
to do that to herself.

32:37.960 --> 32:39.280
<i>Do you hear that?</i>

32:40.520 --> 32:41.920
<i>I mean, come on.</i>

32:44.200 --> 32:46.560
<i>Do you really think
you're still capable...</i>

32:48.200 --> 32:51.320
<i>of doing that sort of thing?</i>

33:03.680 --> 33:04.760
Bobbin...

33:09.160 --> 33:11.160
Come on.

33:11.240 --> 33:12.120
Sit.

33:13.640 --> 33:14.800
Good boy.

34:39.720 --> 34:40.720
You?

34:42.200 --> 34:44.040
What, having an affair?

34:44.120 --> 34:46.320
No, I think that's highly unlikely.

34:47.440 --> 34:50.800
Anyone shows you the slightest bit
of interest and you run a mile.

34:51.680 --> 34:54.480
I mean, you're not exactly
much to look at.

34:54.560 --> 34:56.200
I know, sorry.

35:00.680 --> 35:02.560
You know, men definitely like you.

35:04.200 --> 35:07.760
The thing is, I know you don't do
anything to encourage them, but...

35:08.720 --> 35:11.280
it is hard to be around sometimes.

35:12.440 --> 35:16.920
Those family holidays
we took when the kids were little.

35:17.000 --> 35:18.560
You in your bikini.

35:19.240 --> 35:22.200
I got a knot in my stomach
any time Jim suggested

35:22.280 --> 35:23.720
you two go for groceries.

35:24.400 --> 35:25.880
Or go get wood.

35:26.960 --> 35:28.320
To coin a phrase.

35:34.520 --> 35:36.320
Anything else you wanna tell me?

35:37.960 --> 35:38.880
No.

36:28.160 --> 36:29.120
Oh, God...

36:47.360 --> 36:49.280
<i>Hello. Fairbridge Court,
how can I help?</i>

36:53.440 --> 36:54.600
Hello?

36:54.680 --> 36:57.200
<i>Fairbridge Court Nursing Home.
Can I help you?</i>

36:59.240 --> 37:02.200
Yes, I'm looking for my...

37:02.280 --> 37:05.000
<i>- Oh, hi, it's Mrs. Harding, isn't it?</i>
- Yeah.

37:05.080 --> 37:07.600
<i>I'll put you through
to your father's room.</i>

37:07.680 --> 37:08.800
Thank you.

37:11.840 --> 37:13.000
Hello, Dad?

37:14.280 --> 37:16.320
<i>I want you to stop calling me.</i>

37:17.600 --> 37:18.640
Dad, it's Johanna!

37:19.200 --> 37:22.080
<i>Stop calling me,
and stop stealing my money.</i>

37:22.960 --> 37:25.160
<i>And I don't want
these fucking pills anymore.</i>

37:25.240 --> 37:26.560
Dad, it's me.

37:27.160 --> 37:29.160
<i>I know what you've been up to.</i>

37:30.400 --> 37:32.080
<i>Double-dipping bitch!</i>

37:35.400 --> 37:38.560
Listen, some days
he's really quite lucid

37:38.640 --> 37:41.360
and he can absolutely recognise...

37:42.440 --> 37:44.000
But other days he's...

37:45.560 --> 37:47.640
I'm so sorry. I was gonna tell you.

37:48.240 --> 37:49.920
I was just waiting for the...

37:52.800 --> 37:56.160
This kicked in
about ten, eleven months ago.

37:58.360 --> 38:00.000
- It's dementia.
- No!

38:00.080 --> 38:02.320
- We had to move him.
- No!

38:02.400 --> 38:05.680
No! No, you said...

38:05.760 --> 38:08.080
- No, you said he had a cold!
- I had to say that.

38:08.160 --> 38:11.760
No, you said, "He's not coming
to visit you because he has a cold!"

38:16.800 --> 38:20.120
- Liar.
- I'm sorry.

38:21.760 --> 38:23.080
Jo!

39:26.360 --> 39:30.320
- I think someone stole my phone.
- No, no.

39:30.880 --> 39:33.840
You left it somewhere,
in a shop or something.

39:34.520 --> 39:35.960
I'll get you a new one, okay?

39:36.040 --> 39:39.680
- I don't want a new one!
- Okay.

39:40.440 --> 39:43.280
- I want my old phone!
- I know. I'm sorry.

39:43.360 --> 39:45.760
I want my pink phone.

40:13.720 --> 40:16.720
<i>You put your dad in a home.</i>

40:18.320 --> 40:20.320
<i>You don't have a clue, do you?</i>

40:20.400 --> 40:23.120
<i>About what sort of person
you've become.</i>

40:24.320 --> 40:25.920
I know I miss my dog.

40:37.880 --> 40:40.000
You wore this when you buried Bobbin.

40:49.560 --> 40:51.280
Is none of this coming back to you?

40:52.320 --> 40:53.440
No.

40:55.200 --> 40:56.680
I...

40:58.520 --> 41:01.520
I think I saw someone
in the garden earlier.

41:02.160 --> 41:03.560
Someone who was watching me.

41:06.600 --> 41:07.800
Really?

41:11.240 --> 41:15.440
Maybe I just imagined it. Just...

41:29.840 --> 41:30.960
There you go.

41:31.600 --> 41:32.800
Thank you.

42:00.280 --> 42:01.160
Finn?

42:02.760 --> 42:03.760
Finn?

42:44.200 --> 42:45.360
Finn!

42:46.000 --> 42:47.160
What are you doing here?

42:47.240 --> 42:49.880
You've got to come and see this!
It's incredible.

42:49.960 --> 42:52.840
But it's the middle
of the night. Rob!

42:52.920 --> 42:55.240
Mum! If you don't come,
you'll totally regret it.

42:55.320 --> 42:56.160
Rob!

42:56.240 --> 42:58.480
Dad's already down there.
He sent me to fetch you.

42:58.560 --> 43:00.600
They're trying to save them.
It's a whole pod.

43:00.680 --> 43:02.680
They can't get back in
without our help.

43:02.760 --> 43:04.080
Let's get in the car!

43:12.880 --> 43:14.040
They're down there.

43:14.840 --> 43:16.240
They're not letting it go.

43:27.280 --> 43:28.480
Watch your step.

43:28.560 --> 43:31.560
Excuse me. Come on.

43:31.640 --> 43:33.600
Excuse me!

43:35.360 --> 43:37.480
Stand back!

44:06.160 --> 44:07.200
Rob!

44:33.720 --> 44:34.720
Rob!

44:56.160 --> 44:57.040
Rob!

45:49.720 --> 45:52.720
