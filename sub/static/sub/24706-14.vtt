00:26.255 --> 00:30.419
11:30 sharp, John,
I got to go see Dan Breen.

00:30.492 --> 00:32.255
I canceled on him twice.

00:32.327 --> 00:33.259
No problem.

00:33.328 --> 00:34.761
He gets all upset.

00:34.830 --> 00:36.593
Oh, man.

00:41.270 --> 00:43.761
No bruises, no strangulation marks,
one gunshot wound.

00:43.839 --> 00:45.272
18-month-old female.

00:45.340 --> 00:48.832
She was in the baby seat
when she was shot.

00:48.910 --> 00:49.842
The driver?

00:49.911 --> 00:50.969
Yeah.

00:55.984 --> 00:57.417
I'm Detective Kelly.

00:57.486 --> 00:59.351
You the driver of the car?

00:59.421 --> 01:01.286
Yeah. Yeah. God Almighty.

01:01.356 --> 01:02.789
What's your name?

01:02.858 --> 01:04.917
Duane Rollins.
My girlfriend's kid got shot.

01:04.992 --> 01:06.927
See who fired the gun?

01:06.995 --> 01:08.428
I didn't see anything.

01:08.497 --> 01:10.795
They were beside me shooting,
out of nowhere.

01:10.866 --> 01:11.798
How many?

01:11.867 --> 01:13.801
I don't know.

01:13.869 --> 01:15.894
Two? Driver
and a shooter, or...

01:15.971 --> 01:18.064
I guess.
They just shot and took off.

01:18.140 --> 01:21.132
Did you get a look at the car?

01:21.209 --> 01:23.643
Maybe it was brown.
I don't know.

01:23.712 --> 01:25.703
Is there anybody
who might be after you?

01:25.781 --> 01:28.306
No. It was one of those
drive-by things.

01:29.384 --> 01:30.783
Where's the mother?

01:30.852 --> 01:33.753
I don't know. She didn't
come home last night.

01:33.822 --> 01:35.414
Simmons, let me use your phone.

01:35.490 --> 01:37.583
Can you spell the mother's name?

01:37.659 --> 01:39.490
R- O-W-E. Sandy Rowe.

01:39.561 --> 01:41.119
How you doing?

01:41.196 --> 01:43.460
What was the baby's name?

01:43.532 --> 01:45.227
Tiffany.

01:45.300 --> 01:48.428
Yeah. Who's this?

01:48.503 --> 01:50.437
Lois, what are you, nuts?

01:51.840 --> 01:55.105
Oh, nice. Real nice.
You better call 911.

01:58.880 --> 02:01.974
Yeah. O.K.
I'll come right over. Yeah.

02:02.050 --> 02:03.950
You guys live together?

02:04.019 --> 02:05.953
John, I got to go.
Personal situation.

02:06.021 --> 02:07.454
You all right?

02:07.522 --> 02:09.251
Yeah. I'll tell you
about it later.

02:09.324 --> 02:11.258
John, can I talk to you?

02:11.326 --> 02:12.850
Sure. Hang loose, Duane.

02:12.928 --> 02:15.920
There's a witness here
that saw the car chase.

02:15.997 --> 02:18.932
Saw that guy driving away
from another car.

02:19.000 --> 02:20.433
Let him through.

02:20.502 --> 02:22.436
Mr. Spinks,
this is Detective Kelly.

02:22.504 --> 02:24.096
You saw what happened?

02:24.172 --> 02:26.106
I heard 'em way back there.

02:26.174 --> 02:27.300
Tires screeching.

02:27.376 --> 02:29.844
Then they come up
where I was walking.

02:29.911 --> 02:31.640
They chased him up here.

02:31.713 --> 02:33.476
That's where
they started shooting.

02:33.548 --> 02:34.480
See any faces?

02:34.549 --> 02:35.481
No.

02:35.550 --> 02:37.984
All I saw was a gray car
racing past.

02:38.053 --> 02:41.853
Two guys. I couldn't even
tell if they were white or black.

02:41.923 --> 02:44.357
O.K. Thanks for your help.

02:44.426 --> 02:45.859
Thank you, James.

02:45.927 --> 02:48.862
Duane, I want you to come
to the station house.

02:48.930 --> 02:50.864
We need to talk more.

02:50.932 --> 02:52.797
I don't know anything else.

02:52.868 --> 02:54.529
I understand.
Come with me.

02:54.603 --> 02:55.535
What for?

02:55.604 --> 02:57.799
Duane, get in that car over there.

02:57.873 --> 02:58.805
Let's go.

03:10.552 --> 03:11.985
Where is he?

03:12.053 --> 03:14.487
Oh, thank you, Andy.
I'm losing my mind.

03:14.556 --> 03:16.421
I can't believe it...
Howie Hornbeck.

03:16.491 --> 03:18.755
He came here
after his night shift.

03:18.827 --> 03:20.419
He always gets worked up.

03:20.495 --> 03:23.987
All of a sudden,
he just kicked off.

03:24.065 --> 03:26.932
It was horrible.
I was so freaked out.

03:27.002 --> 03:28.435
Ah, poor Howie.

03:28.503 --> 03:30.937
He was getting too old for this.

03:31.006 --> 03:32.439
He's married, of course.

03:32.507 --> 03:34.566
I got to get him to his car.

03:34.643 --> 03:37.077
It's at the lot
at the station house.

03:37.145 --> 03:39.306
He didn't like parking here.

03:39.381 --> 03:42.509
I got an appointment.
You sit tight.

03:42.584 --> 03:44.518
You got to take him out now.

03:44.586 --> 03:45.951
I got people coming.

03:46.021 --> 03:48.455
You are a real piece of work, Lois.

03:48.523 --> 03:52.220
Howie's not even cold, and you're
worried about your next john.

03:52.294 --> 03:56.424
Andy, either take Howie now,
or I'm going to call 911.

03:56.498 --> 03:57.430
Ah...

03:57.499 --> 03:59.626
help me get him dressed.

04:06.274 --> 04:08.625
Come on, Howie.

05:44.804 --> 05:46.635
Vince Gotelli, night watch.

05:46.706 --> 05:47.638
Adrianne Lesniak.

05:47.707 --> 05:49.572
You guys got a homicide?

05:49.642 --> 05:52.577
Yeah. I'm a little late getting in.

05:52.645 --> 05:55.079
I had a situation at home.

05:55.148 --> 05:58.606
I got to testify in court.

05:58.684 --> 06:00.117
That's quite a cup.

06:00.186 --> 06:01.483
Yeah. Isn't it?

06:01.554 --> 06:03.021
Family heirloom?

06:03.089 --> 06:04.818
It's just for laughs.

06:04.891 --> 06:06.017
I don't get the humor.

06:06.092 --> 06:08.322
What do you mean?
It's my personal cup.

06:08.394 --> 06:09.326
That's great.

06:09.395 --> 06:12.193
I just prefer not to see it.

06:12.265 --> 06:15.564
How about
if I put a brassiere on it?

06:15.635 --> 06:19.071
I hope you stay
on the night watch, Gotelli.

06:20.706 --> 06:22.469
James, run this guy through B.C.I.

06:22.542 --> 06:24.476
How about the girlfriend?

06:24.544 --> 06:25.476
Girlfriend, too.

06:32.885 --> 06:35.319
Greg, would you
situate Duane for me, please?

06:35.388 --> 06:37.219
Yeah.
What's I.A.B. Doing here?

06:37.290 --> 06:38.723
I don't know.

06:38.791 --> 06:40.258
Let's go down here.

06:42.295 --> 06:44.263
What are you doing here, Kimmy?

06:44.330 --> 06:47.697
You tell me. Those guys
brought me in here.

06:47.767 --> 06:49.462
How about you, Tahir?

06:49.535 --> 06:52.436
They just say
they want to talk to me.

06:52.505 --> 06:54.336
Use interviews 1 and 2.

06:54.407 --> 06:57.069
Uh, Lieutenant? I was going to use 1.

06:57.143 --> 06:59.805
Then use the 124 room downstairs.

07:04.083 --> 07:05.516
Let's go, Tahir.

07:05.585 --> 07:07.143
Kimmy.

07:12.391 --> 07:13.483
Come on.

07:14.727 --> 07:16.217
Over here.

07:16.295 --> 07:18.126
What's this about?

07:18.197 --> 07:20.427
They're reinterviewing cases
you worked on.

07:21.567 --> 07:23.501
Can't they do that downtown?

07:23.569 --> 07:26.129
They said the interviewees
live in the precinct.

07:26.205 --> 07:29.333
Where are you
on that child homicide?

07:29.408 --> 07:32.343
The mother's boyfriend
had the little girl in the car.

07:32.411 --> 07:34.345
He said it was a drive-by.

07:34.413 --> 07:36.313
I haven't located her, yet...

07:36.382 --> 07:38.316
but I think he's all wrong.

07:38.384 --> 07:40.147
I don't know how yet.

07:40.219 --> 07:41.652
Go get him.

07:41.721 --> 07:45.452
They're doing this here...

07:45.525 --> 07:46.958
to embarrass me.

08:02.308 --> 08:05.243
How long have you live
at the hotel, Duane?

08:05.311 --> 08:06.744
A couple of weeks.

08:06.812 --> 08:08.973
Where did you live before that?

08:09.107 --> 08:10.131
Another hotel.

08:10.208 --> 08:13.700
We are going to need
more help locating Sandy.

08:13.778 --> 08:16.212
I said she was out
seeing a friend.

08:16.281 --> 08:18.215
She left the child with you.

08:18.283 --> 08:20.217
What was the friend's name?

08:20.285 --> 08:22.116
She never said.

08:22.187 --> 08:24.951
Never mentioned
the friend's name.

08:25.023 --> 08:26.456
I don't remember.

08:26.524 --> 08:30.324
Her being out all night,
weren't you worried about Sandy?

08:30.395 --> 08:31.828
Yeah, I was worried.

08:31.896 --> 08:35.491
I was looking for her
when Tiffany got shot.

08:35.567 --> 08:37.797
Sandy work someplace?

08:37.869 --> 08:40.099
She's looking for work.

08:41.438 --> 08:43.736
John, you got a second?

08:48.446 --> 08:49.378
What's up?

08:49.447 --> 08:50.880
Duane's rap sheet.

08:50.949 --> 08:53.679
Sandy Rowe got popped
for prostitution last night.

08:53.751 --> 08:56.185
She's being arraigned
this morning on Centre Street.

08:56.254 --> 08:58.688
O.K. Let me take care of him.

08:58.756 --> 09:00.189
We'll go get her.

09:00.258 --> 09:02.192
Are you working, Duane?

09:02.260 --> 09:04.194
We've both been looking for work.

09:04.262 --> 09:06.696
We haven't been in town very long.

09:06.764 --> 09:08.527
And you came from where?

09:08.600 --> 09:09.965
Baltimore.

09:11.636 --> 09:14.161
But you...

09:14.239 --> 09:16.400
you used to live here.

09:16.474 --> 09:17.907
So what?

09:17.976 --> 09:22.106
Well... burglary, assault,
possession of cocaine.

09:22.180 --> 09:24.114
You guys are really something.

09:24.182 --> 09:26.116
I get used for target practice...

09:26.184 --> 09:28.118
and now I'm the criminal.

09:28.186 --> 09:30.882
I don't think
this was a random shooting.

09:30.955 --> 09:33.014
What do you call it?

09:33.091 --> 09:34.752
I think you know these people.

09:34.826 --> 09:36.760
They chased you in traffic...

09:36.828 --> 09:39.262
in and out, for two blocks.

09:39.330 --> 09:42.128
Is this fun for you guys?

09:42.200 --> 09:45.431
I'm broken up, and you
just want to harass my ass.

09:45.503 --> 09:47.937
I don't care
what else you're into...

09:48.006 --> 09:49.871
but you know these people.

09:49.941 --> 09:53.240
They chased you and shot
an 18-month-old girl.

09:53.311 --> 09:54.744
Give them up.

09:54.812 --> 09:56.746
I don't know
who they were...

09:56.814 --> 09:58.907
or why they picked us.

09:58.983 --> 10:02.282
We just picked up Sandy
for prostitution.

10:02.353 --> 10:06.084
We're going down to Centre Street
to pick her up now.

10:06.157 --> 10:09.092
So while I'm there,
I want you to sit here...

10:09.160 --> 10:11.458
and think about
your little scenario...

10:11.529 --> 10:14.896
'cause I want to come back
and get it right.

10:14.966 --> 10:17.332
Got it?

10:17.402 --> 10:19.802
18 months old, Duane.

10:23.274 --> 10:25.174
18 months old.

10:36.454 --> 10:38.888
Howie, now I got to
make you presentable...

10:38.957 --> 10:40.891
you dumb son of a bitch.

10:40.959 --> 10:43.655
Get your tongue inside there.

11:02.981 --> 11:03.913
Hey.

11:03.982 --> 11:05.540
The invisible man.

11:05.617 --> 11:08.142
Dan, I'm sorry
about all the postponements.

11:08.219 --> 11:10.346
Don't be sorry.
Remedy your faults.

11:10.421 --> 11:12.889
And I got to do it again.

11:12.957 --> 11:14.891
What's going on with you?

11:14.959 --> 11:17.291
In general or right now?

11:17.362 --> 11:19.296
3 telephone conversations
in 24 days.

11:19.364 --> 11:21.798
That's what I wanted
to explain to you.

11:21.866 --> 11:24.300
You say you've been going
to meetings.

11:24.369 --> 11:27.167
I've been going to the 10:15s
at Gramercy Park.

11:27.238 --> 11:29.706
O.K. I'll take
your word for that...

11:29.774 --> 11:31.765
but it's evident
something's going on.

11:40.418 --> 11:42.579
All right, look, Dan...

11:42.654 --> 11:46.055
there may be an advancement...

11:46.124 --> 11:49.525
in my relationship with Sylvia.

11:49.594 --> 11:53.325
Now, I wanted to discuss
this with you in detail...

11:53.398 --> 11:55.332
What kind of advancement?

11:55.400 --> 11:59.734
Uh... we're talking
about living together.

11:59.804 --> 12:02.898
You were O.K.'d
to have dinner with her.

12:02.974 --> 12:04.236
I wanted to talk about...

12:04.308 --> 12:06.776
Next time I see you,
you're cohabiting!

12:06.844 --> 12:08.505
I have a pressing obligation...

12:08.579 --> 12:10.843
You are a classic drunk!

12:10.915 --> 12:12.678
You can't stay
inside boundaries.

12:12.750 --> 12:14.684
You walk in for dinner.

12:14.752 --> 12:16.913
You walk out,
you're shacked up!

12:16.988 --> 12:20.480
I'm surprised you didn't
ask her to marry you!

12:24.028 --> 12:27.088
I got to go.
I'll talk to you later.

12:30.134 --> 12:32.534
Hey! Get away from the car!

12:32.603 --> 12:35.037
Hey, man,
can you spare some change?

12:35.106 --> 12:37.540
I'm not a drug addict
or alcoholic.

12:37.608 --> 12:40.441
I got a job interview,
but no subway fare.

12:40.511 --> 12:42.570
Here. Take off.

12:42.647 --> 12:43.978
What's wrong with him?

12:44.048 --> 12:46.243
Nothing.
He's drunk like you.

12:46.317 --> 12:47.944
That man looks dead!

12:48.019 --> 12:49.611
Will you get lost?

12:49.687 --> 12:51.484
What did you do to him?

12:51.556 --> 12:53.615
Hey, y'all!
There's a dead man over here!

12:53.691 --> 12:55.818
You know what this means?

12:55.893 --> 12:58.384
It means shut up
and start walking.

12:58.463 --> 13:00.397
All right. I hear you.

13:13.277 --> 13:14.710
Where is Duane?

13:14.779 --> 13:17.213
We need to talk a little more...

13:17.281 --> 13:18.714
then maybe see Duane.

13:20.251 --> 13:22.685
James, take her up
to Interview, will you?

13:22.754 --> 13:24.085
Sure.

13:25.790 --> 13:27.223
Kimmy, come here.

13:30.995 --> 13:32.929
Who did you piss off?

13:32.997 --> 13:34.430
What did I.A.B. Want?

13:34.499 --> 13:38.435
To talk about that money
you got me after Nicky was shot.

13:38.503 --> 13:41.700
I got it so you could
get out of town.

13:41.773 --> 13:45.402
They wanted to know
if you got me the money for sex.

13:45.476 --> 13:47.842
You told them the truth, though.

13:47.912 --> 13:49.402
I'm not feeling so good.

13:49.480 --> 13:51.914
Kimmy... you told them
the truth, though, right?

13:51.983 --> 13:52.915
Yeah.

13:52.984 --> 13:55.418
Yeah, I said it wasn't like that.

13:55.486 --> 13:58.978
I kind of got the feeling
that was the B" answer.

13:59.056 --> 14:01.217
How was Florida?

14:01.292 --> 14:04.887
Uh, I was going to go,
you know, but I...

14:04.962 --> 14:07.897
I kind of got
into some behavior.

14:07.965 --> 14:09.933
O.K.

14:10.001 --> 14:11.935
Take care of yourself, O. K?

14:13.905 --> 14:15.395
You, too.

14:23.681 --> 14:25.615
How old are you, Sandy?

14:25.683 --> 14:26.615
19.

14:26.684 --> 14:29.312
Do you know ifTiffany
said anything?

14:29.387 --> 14:31.821
If she was alive at all afterward?

14:31.889 --> 14:34.323
I think she died right away.

14:39.564 --> 14:41.998
I know this is
painful for you, Sandy...

14:42.066 --> 14:44.296
but I've got to ask you
some questions...

14:44.368 --> 14:46.802
and it's important
that you're honest with me.

14:46.871 --> 14:47.735
I understand.

14:47.805 --> 14:49.739
Now, was anybody
after Duane...

14:49.807 --> 14:51.240
that you know about?

14:51.309 --> 14:52.970
No.

14:53.044 --> 14:55.979
Nobody he had run-ins with
that you know about?

14:56.047 --> 14:56.979
No.

14:57.048 --> 14:59.312
How long
have you been together?

14:59.383 --> 15:02.978
About... six months, I guess.

15:03.054 --> 15:04.954
How long
you been turning tricks?

15:05.022 --> 15:07.456
A couple of months.
Not every day, though.

15:07.525 --> 15:10.460
I just been going out
once in a while.

15:10.528 --> 15:13.292
Because it sounds
like he's got a drug habit...

15:13.364 --> 15:15.798
and that's why
he's got you out there.

15:15.867 --> 15:18.267
He doesn't use drugs.

15:18.336 --> 15:20.770
I'm not here trying
to bust him for that...

15:20.838 --> 15:24.274
but Tiffany was in the car
with him when she got shot.

15:24.342 --> 15:26.640
We want to catch
the people who did this.

15:26.711 --> 15:28.144
I don't know anything.

15:28.212 --> 15:29.611
We can protect you.

15:29.680 --> 15:31.944
You'll think about this
the rest of your life.

15:32.016 --> 15:34.450
I'm thinking of her
every second now.

15:34.518 --> 15:37.351
Do you want to remember
you didn't do anything?

15:37.421 --> 15:38.854
I don't know anything.

15:38.923 --> 15:41.323
He never talked to me
about business.

15:41.392 --> 15:42.689
Was Duane dealing?

15:45.363 --> 15:48.230
Look... Look, I just want to look...

15:48.299 --> 15:50.233
at my little girl, O. K?

15:50.301 --> 15:52.496
I just want to see my baby.

15:54.572 --> 15:56.938
Take her over
to 30th Street, James.

15:57.008 --> 15:57.940
O.K.

15:59.577 --> 16:00.874
Come on, Sandy.

16:22.533 --> 16:23.898
Greg.

16:23.968 --> 16:24.957
Hey, Andy.

16:25.036 --> 16:27.937
Come here.
I want to talk to you a minute.

16:28.005 --> 16:29.939
Boy, th-that Cuban-American place...

16:30.007 --> 16:31.440
is getting really popular.

16:31.509 --> 16:33.807
I was over there for lunch today...

16:33.878 --> 16:35.311
Help me with something?

16:35.379 --> 16:36.812
Yeah. What's up?

16:36.881 --> 16:37.813
Come here.

16:37.882 --> 16:39.816
I want to ask you something.

16:39.884 --> 16:42.318
Get in the car.
We got to go someplace.

16:42.386 --> 16:43.819
That's Howie Hornbeck's car.

16:43.888 --> 16:45.321
Yeah, I know, Medavoy.

16:45.389 --> 16:46.321
Where's Howie?

16:46.390 --> 16:49.188
A couple of blocks away
in my car.

16:49.260 --> 16:50.693
We're going over there...

16:50.761 --> 16:52.820
then you're going
to drive my car back.

16:52.897 --> 16:54.524
Then you'll ride back with Howie.

16:54.598 --> 16:56.896
Yeah. Please, just get in the car.

16:56.968 --> 16:58.993
Did your car go dead?

16:59.070 --> 17:00.503
No, Medavoy.
Howie's dead.

17:00.571 --> 17:03.096
I want to move him
into his car...

17:03.174 --> 17:05.233
but I don't want to do it...

17:05.309 --> 17:07.742
in front of the station house.

17:07.811 --> 17:09.108
How-How-Howie's dead?

17:09.180 --> 17:12.047
Medavoy, get in the car!

17:28.599 --> 17:31.033
Let's put him
in the passenger's seat.

17:31.102 --> 17:33.935
When we get outside the station,
we'll slide him over.

17:34.005 --> 17:35.939
How many laws are we breaking?

17:36.007 --> 17:37.804
What should I do, Medavoy?

17:37.875 --> 17:40.309
Have him get found
with a $40 hooker?

17:40.378 --> 17:41.811
I'll get the feet.

17:41.879 --> 17:44.279
I'll take the top.

17:44.348 --> 17:45.280
On 3.

17:45.349 --> 17:46.281
Yeah.

17:46.350 --> 17:47.715
1, 2, 3!

17:47.785 --> 17:48.717
Get him.

17:48.786 --> 17:50.219
I got him.

17:50.287 --> 17:51.219
O.K. O.K.

17:55.359 --> 17:56.485
Oh, jeez!

17:56.560 --> 17:59.290
Oh, man, Howie. Whew!

17:59.363 --> 18:02.799
O.K. We got to get
the feet in first.

18:06.137 --> 18:09.072
Oh, man.
He's got me all tangled up.

18:13.244 --> 18:14.404
All right.

18:14.478 --> 18:15.877
Now slide him over.

18:15.946 --> 18:16.878
Why?

18:16.947 --> 18:18.881
So I can grab his collar.

18:18.949 --> 18:20.883
Otherwise,
I step on the brake...

18:20.951 --> 18:23.886
he smashes his head
on the dashboard.

18:25.923 --> 18:27.185
That's good.

18:28.325 --> 18:29.758
Here's my keys.

18:31.729 --> 18:35.096
Hey, Andy,
something's not right.

18:35.166 --> 18:37.498
Did you button these buttons?

18:37.568 --> 18:40.002
I was in a hurry.

18:47.178 --> 18:48.611
There. That's better.

18:48.679 --> 18:50.408
All right.
Close the door.

18:51.749 --> 18:55.685
Does your car have
any special handling traits?

18:55.753 --> 18:57.050
No.

18:57.154 --> 18:58.052
Jimmy, listen...

18:58.122 --> 19:00.716
'cause you need to see a doctor.

19:02.259 --> 19:04.193
'Cause you need treatment, Jimmy.

19:07.231 --> 19:08.493
Why?

19:08.566 --> 19:12.593
You say they're going to find me
in a pool of blood?

19:15.106 --> 19:18.075
Our lives are not over.

19:18.142 --> 19:21.305
We should go on
and find new lives.

19:21.378 --> 19:24.176
Please, let me do that.

19:24.248 --> 19:25.681
Do it for yourself.

19:27.518 --> 19:28.951
You stop this.

19:29.019 --> 19:31.453
I'm asking you for the last time.

19:31.522 --> 19:32.955
I'm hanging up.

19:33.023 --> 19:35.355
I'm hanging up, Jimmy.

19:35.426 --> 19:38.020
Oh, God. Please!

19:38.095 --> 19:39.528
Leave me alone.

20:01.519 --> 20:03.578
Miss Hypersensitive.

20:03.654 --> 20:06.088
I thought you were
on night tour.

20:06.157 --> 20:08.091
I just finished in court.

20:08.159 --> 20:09.592
Well, leave me alone.

20:09.660 --> 20:12.094
Is someone about to get the curse?

20:12.163 --> 20:13.095
Oh, Gotelli.

20:13.164 --> 20:14.256
You know...

20:14.331 --> 20:16.595
I was going to get
Band-Aids for this...

20:16.667 --> 20:19.795
but, uh, I didn't have the time.

20:41.425 --> 20:42.357
Sit down.

20:44.828 --> 20:46.318
Sit down, Duane.

20:47.831 --> 20:49.765
When am I getting released?

20:51.569 --> 20:53.002
I don't know.

20:53.070 --> 20:56.506
Look, I didn't see 'em,
I don't know 'em.

20:56.574 --> 20:58.064
What can I do?

20:58.142 --> 21:01.077
If you were in the middle
of a criminal act...

21:01.145 --> 21:02.578
say drug dealing...

21:02.646 --> 21:04.580
when this child got killed
in your car...

21:04.648 --> 21:06.582
that's like pulling the trigger.

21:06.650 --> 21:09.483
What, is that bitch
telling you I'm dealing?

21:09.553 --> 21:10.577
She's crazy.

21:10.654 --> 21:13.088
You got a crack problem.

21:13.157 --> 21:15.591
That's a crock, too,
but I'm handy.

21:15.659 --> 21:17.092
Pin something on me.

21:18.495 --> 21:19.928
Here's the other thing.

21:19.997 --> 21:21.931
These guys that are after you...

21:21.999 --> 21:24.092
are not going to let up...

21:24.168 --> 21:26.602
after what you witnessed
this morning.

21:26.670 --> 21:29.104
Hey, you're not slick enough
for this work.

21:29.173 --> 21:31.607
I'm not dealing anything,
and nobody's after me.

21:31.675 --> 21:34.371
You believed everything
that crazy bitch told you.

21:34.445 --> 21:35.878
She lost her child.

21:35.946 --> 21:38.380
I think you owe her
a little respect.

21:38.449 --> 21:39.882
Where's my respect?

21:39.950 --> 21:42.384
Be a man,
and you'll get your respect.

21:42.453 --> 21:45.820
The kid was killed in your car.
You're responsible.

21:45.889 --> 21:48.949
So take responsibility for it
and give me these guys.

21:49.026 --> 21:50.960
I don't owe anybody anything.

21:51.028 --> 21:53.724
Nobody ever gave me
one damn thing.

21:53.797 --> 21:56.231
So you go on,
buck for your promotion.

21:56.300 --> 21:59.758
I've been stepped on
by badder guys than you'll ever see.

21:59.837 --> 22:01.304
I doubt that, Duane.

22:01.372 --> 22:04.967
No? I been screwed by experts
since I was a kid.

22:05.042 --> 22:07.476
You want a victim of child abuse?

22:07.544 --> 22:08.977
You're looking at one.

22:09.046 --> 22:10.980
Locked in closets, beat with a board.

22:11.048 --> 22:13.482
What do you know about
what I had to go through?

22:13.550 --> 22:15.108
Sandy is out on the street...

22:15.185 --> 22:17.619
She was hustling
when I met her.

22:17.688 --> 22:19.121
Turning tricks,
hooked on dope.

22:19.189 --> 22:21.657
Her child's been killed.
That's your fault.

22:21.725 --> 22:23.158
Man, you're really simple.

22:23.227 --> 22:25.661
She'd be dead
if it wasn't for me.

22:25.729 --> 22:28.254
I'm not any kind of damn pimp.

22:28.332 --> 22:30.766
I tried to take her
out of the life.

22:30.834 --> 22:32.495
She sneaks off.

22:32.569 --> 22:35.504
I tried to be a father
to that kid...

22:35.572 --> 22:37.506
but I can't control everything.

22:37.574 --> 22:39.007
You're a liar, Duane.

22:39.076 --> 22:40.407
I don't care what you think.

22:40.477 --> 22:42.638
I can look myself
in the mirror anytime.

22:42.713 --> 22:44.374
What do you see?

22:44.448 --> 22:46.279
I see a good guy.

22:49.853 --> 22:51.787
O.K. This is what we got.

22:51.855 --> 22:53.720
You're not getting out of here.

22:53.791 --> 22:55.349
I'm not bucking
for any promotion...

22:55.426 --> 22:57.860
'cause I'm about strung up
on this job.

22:57.928 --> 23:00.362
So if I have to lock the doors...

23:00.431 --> 23:03.366
and pull the shades down
in here...

23:03.434 --> 23:06.267
to get what I want
from you, I will.

23:06.337 --> 23:07.770
I want these guys.

23:07.838 --> 23:09.305
Got it?

23:48.979 --> 23:52.244
Poor little baby, huh?

23:53.317 --> 23:54.909
There, there.

23:54.985 --> 23:57.078
There, huh?

24:26.485 --> 24:28.112
Sandy...

24:28.187 --> 24:29.449
in your daughter's memory...

24:29.521 --> 24:31.682
I want you to cooperate with us.

24:36.261 --> 24:38.388
Some dealers let Duane...

24:38.464 --> 24:41.900
have credit
on a quarter ounce...

24:41.967 --> 24:44.902
'cause Duane had a buyer.

24:44.970 --> 24:46.733
When the guy didn't show...

24:46.805 --> 24:50.070
we did a lot of it.

24:50.142 --> 24:53.578
Duane tried to talk
his way out of it.

24:55.814 --> 24:58.749
He told me they were
real pissed at him...

24:58.817 --> 25:01.411
for not coming up with money.

25:03.989 --> 25:05.650
It could have been them.

25:05.724 --> 25:07.385
Do you know their names?

25:10.129 --> 25:12.620
Tito was one.

25:13.799 --> 25:16.893
And I don't know
their last names.

25:18.137 --> 25:20.731
Duane would have to tell you.

25:20.806 --> 25:23.070
Do you know
what they look like?

25:23.142 --> 25:24.575
Where they deal out of?

25:24.643 --> 25:26.406
You ever seen them?

25:26.478 --> 25:27.740
No.

25:30.582 --> 25:32.516
I don't think so.

25:38.090 --> 25:41.184
O.K. O.K.
We'll get it off of Duane.

25:42.928 --> 25:44.327
All right?

25:52.571 --> 25:55.005
Sarge, Howie Hornbeck's dead.

25:55.073 --> 25:56.540
Where is he?
What happened?

25:56.608 --> 25:58.872
In the parking lot
in his car.

25:58.944 --> 26:00.707
Well, let me call E.M.S.

26:00.779 --> 26:03.270
He must have been
out there all day.

26:03.348 --> 26:05.612
He must have had
a heart attack.

26:05.684 --> 26:07.618
Yeah. This is
the 15th Precinct.

26:07.686 --> 26:10.120
We need an ambulance
to pronounce a D.O.A.

26:10.189 --> 26:11.622
What's up?

26:11.690 --> 26:13.783
Howie Hornbeck died.

26:13.859 --> 26:15.326
Howie Hornbeck?

26:15.394 --> 26:16.827
Howie Hornbeck.

26:26.238 --> 26:28.103
How can I help myself?

26:30.476 --> 26:32.068
Done with this guy?

26:32.144 --> 26:33.236
Yeah.

26:33.312 --> 26:34.745
See you, Tahir.

26:34.813 --> 26:36.246
See you, Detective.

26:36.315 --> 26:38.249
Let me ask you a question.

26:38.317 --> 26:40.581
You're using him
to make a case...

26:40.652 --> 26:42.085
against the wrong cop, correct?

26:42.154 --> 26:43.587
Is that the question?

26:43.655 --> 26:45.589
No. If you're dealing with him...

26:45.657 --> 26:47.750
on Hudson Street all the time...

26:47.826 --> 26:50.226
why reinterview
on my collar up here?

26:50.295 --> 26:51.557
It's called obeying orders.

26:51.630 --> 26:53.564
You ought to try it sometime.

26:53.632 --> 26:55.566
Your orders are to humiliate me...

26:55.634 --> 26:57.067
in my own house?

26:57.135 --> 26:58.397
I got to go.

26:58.470 --> 27:00.904
I want an answer
from you right now.

27:00.973 --> 27:02.736
Go ahead, Detective.

27:02.808 --> 27:04.400
Make another mistake.

27:06.144 --> 27:08.408
I was parked right next to him.

27:08.480 --> 27:10.744
I must have walked right past him.

27:10.816 --> 27:13.080
I'm taking
a membership at a gym.

27:13.151 --> 27:14.550
You hear about Howie Hornbeck?

27:14.620 --> 27:16.247
The night tour guy? What happened?

27:16.321 --> 27:17.583
I found him dead.

27:17.656 --> 27:18.588
You're kidding.

27:18.657 --> 27:19.783
A heart attack.

27:19.858 --> 27:21.120
Sit at my desk.

27:21.193 --> 27:24.629
I don't think I'll be able
to recognize any pictures.

27:24.696 --> 27:27.221
Go ahead.
We'll see how you do.

27:27.299 --> 27:28.561
Howie Hornbeck died.

27:28.634 --> 27:30.261
How you doing with her?

27:30.335 --> 27:32.098
She gave up
the boyfriend's dealing.

27:32.170 --> 27:34.434
He had two guys
mad at him.

27:34.506 --> 27:38.374
All she had was the first name
on one of them...

27:38.443 --> 27:40.434
but I'll run some photos anyway.

27:40.512 --> 27:42.605
Where do we stand
on the boyfriend?

27:42.681 --> 27:44.273
He said he didn't see anything.

27:44.349 --> 27:45.281
Lieutenant.

27:47.519 --> 27:48.781
You got a minute?

27:48.854 --> 27:50.549
Yeah.

27:51.990 --> 27:52.922
Stay on him.

27:55.994 --> 27:58.258
I got to talk to the M.E.

27:58.330 --> 27:59.422
O.K.

28:01.166 --> 28:03.430
What was that name
she gave up?

28:03.502 --> 28:04.434
Sandy?

28:04.503 --> 28:05.765
Tito.

28:05.837 --> 28:07.304
Tito. Stay on her.

28:07.372 --> 28:08.339
O.K.

28:13.245 --> 28:15.372
I got to contact
Hornbeck's family.

28:15.447 --> 28:17.745
This won't take long.

28:19.484 --> 28:20.917
Kelly's transferred
to the Borough.

28:20.986 --> 28:22.180
He'll work dispatch.

28:22.254 --> 28:24.688
I.A.B. Goes through
his laundry for a month.

28:24.756 --> 28:26.018
I.A.B.'s a separate matter.

28:26.091 --> 28:27.149
They find zilch.

28:27.225 --> 28:28.487
I.A.B.'s inquiry is separate.

28:28.560 --> 28:30.323
It's my understanding
it's not complete.

28:30.395 --> 28:31.828
You still hang him out...

28:31.897 --> 28:33.364
The man
was borderline insubordinate.

28:33.432 --> 28:35.696
He stinks from that trial.
He's reassigned.

28:35.767 --> 28:37.462
No, this stinks, Captain.

28:38.704 --> 28:41.434
Let's you and me
work a signal out.

28:41.506 --> 28:44.441
If I'm here for your opinion
on something...

28:44.509 --> 28:46.409
I'll come in wearing a rose.

28:46.478 --> 28:49.106
Let the man know.

28:58.857 --> 29:01.792
Here come the marines.

29:01.860 --> 29:04.294
Story of your life, Duane.

29:04.363 --> 29:05.295
What is?

29:05.364 --> 29:07.525
In too long, out too soon.

29:07.599 --> 29:10.534
I'll be smart enough
when I file for brutality.

29:10.602 --> 29:11.796
For what?

29:11.870 --> 29:13.633
Nobody touched you.

29:13.705 --> 29:15.297
You could have walked out...

29:15.374 --> 29:17.501
with some cash in your pocket.

29:17.576 --> 29:18.907
Cash, huh?

29:20.445 --> 29:21.844
How would that have worked?

29:21.913 --> 29:24.347
That's what I've been trying
to tell you.

29:24.416 --> 29:26.179
A 2-year-old's been shot.

29:26.251 --> 29:27.684
We got to clear that.

29:27.753 --> 29:30.847
We could have gone
into our pockets for you.

29:30.922 --> 29:32.355
But you made me wait...

29:32.424 --> 29:34.517
so I don't need you anymore.

29:34.593 --> 29:35.855
I got another witness.

29:35.927 --> 29:37.724
Oh, yeah?

29:37.796 --> 29:39.229
Yeah.

29:39.297 --> 29:41.231
I don't think you have anything...

29:41.299 --> 29:43.563
or you wouldn't be talking to me.

29:43.635 --> 29:45.569
I've got Tito.

29:49.808 --> 29:52.072
Tito rolled on his buddy...

29:52.144 --> 29:56.410
and he got the deal
that you could have had.

29:56.481 --> 29:59.109
So I got something.

30:06.358 --> 30:08.451
Is there any money left?

30:16.201 --> 30:18.795
I'm gonna need
full cooperation.

30:18.870 --> 30:22.829
I'm gonna need names,
places of business...

30:22.908 --> 30:25.206
then I got to prove to the D. A...

30:25.277 --> 30:26.801
you're not an asshole.

30:44.830 --> 30:46.422
You looking for me?

30:47.833 --> 30:48.765
Detective Sipowicz?

30:48.834 --> 30:49.823
Yeah.

30:49.901 --> 30:51.835
I understand
you discovered the body.

30:51.903 --> 30:53.495
What was it, heart attack?

30:53.572 --> 30:56.473
I think so.
We'll verify in autopsy.

30:56.541 --> 30:58.975
But I'm concerned
about the body position.

30:59.044 --> 31:00.477
What do you mean?

31:00.545 --> 31:03.139
Lividity's all wrong
for the position he's in.

31:03.215 --> 31:05.513
Well, I, uh,
I moved him a little.

31:05.584 --> 31:06.846
When I found him...

31:06.918 --> 31:09.182
he was sagging
on the steering wheel.

31:09.254 --> 31:10.346
I pulled him back.

31:10.422 --> 31:12.856
When this man died,
he wasn't sitting up.

31:12.924 --> 31:15.358
The blood settled
in the front of him.

31:15.427 --> 31:18.294
If he'd been sitting up,
it would have settled...

31:18.363 --> 31:19.625
in the lower part.

31:19.698 --> 31:21.791
Anyway, it was
a heart attack, right?

31:21.867 --> 31:23.801
Also, the front of his shirt's...

31:23.869 --> 31:25.131
tucked in his undershorts.

31:25.203 --> 31:26.966
What are you getting at?

31:27.038 --> 31:28.972
Somebody put
Hornbeck's clothes on him...

31:29.040 --> 31:30.234
and moved him.

31:30.308 --> 31:32.469
No. No.
I totally disagree with that.

31:32.544 --> 31:34.136
You're speaking as a detective?

31:34.212 --> 31:36.305
Yeah. As someone
he worked with.

31:36.381 --> 31:37.814
I met his wife.

31:37.883 --> 31:39.817
There wasn't a crime
committed here.

31:39.885 --> 31:41.147
This was natural causes.

31:41.219 --> 31:43.312
I'm not saying
it wasn't natural causes.

31:44.623 --> 31:46.056
Now what could have happened...

31:46.124 --> 31:48.388
is maybe somebody
pulled his pants up...

31:48.460 --> 31:49.950
or moved him
from someplace...

31:50.028 --> 31:51.290
to somewheres else.

31:51.363 --> 31:53.957
That doesn't have to be
part of the report.

31:54.032 --> 31:55.499
Why not?

31:55.567 --> 31:57.660
Look...

31:57.736 --> 31:58.998
you heard the expression...

31:59.070 --> 32:01.334
I wouldn't want
to get caught dead...

32:01.406 --> 32:02.668
in a certain place"?

32:02.741 --> 32:03.673
Sure.

32:03.742 --> 32:05.676
This could have been
that situation.

32:05.744 --> 32:08.008
He could have been
in a place...

32:08.079 --> 32:10.047
he wouldn't get caught dead in.

32:10.115 --> 32:12.709
And then someone
moved him after he expired...

32:12.784 --> 32:14.217
to save him embarrassment.

32:14.286 --> 32:15.810
I would think so.

32:15.887 --> 32:17.149
You're confident that happened?

32:17.222 --> 32:18.154
100%.

32:18.223 --> 32:20.088
Because the lividity's all wrong.

32:21.326 --> 32:22.588
I'm telling you, Doc...

32:22.661 --> 32:24.856
you can sign off on this one.

32:30.101 --> 32:32.296
O.K.

32:32.370 --> 32:34.895
He died in the car.

32:36.308 --> 32:37.741
O.K.

32:45.984 --> 32:48.919
You gonna show
that to the D. A?

32:48.987 --> 32:50.352
Yeah.

32:51.590 --> 32:54.024
First I want you
to come with us...

32:54.092 --> 32:55.525
and pick these guys out.

32:55.594 --> 32:56.686
In a lineup?

32:56.761 --> 32:58.422
No. In the street.

33:02.200 --> 33:04.293
You never had him.

33:04.369 --> 33:06.803
You son-of-a-bitching liar.

33:06.872 --> 33:09.397
I'm going to get you
the 2,000, Duane.

33:09.474 --> 33:11.738
Maybe if these guys
have federal beefs...

33:11.810 --> 33:13.072
I can relocate you.

33:14.980 --> 33:16.379
Stand up.

33:18.283 --> 33:21.548
Stand up, Duane,
or I'm going to break your neck.

33:26.358 --> 33:28.121
Let's go.

33:29.361 --> 33:30.555
Recognize anybody?

33:32.797 --> 33:34.424
Stand right there.

33:34.499 --> 33:36.933
Andy, he's helping us
pick out the shooters.

33:37.002 --> 33:38.594
Your car.
Mine's airing out.

33:38.670 --> 33:40.160
O.K.

33:40.238 --> 33:41.603
Lieutenant,
he's going to cooperate...

33:41.673 --> 33:43.732
show us where
to grab these guys.

33:43.808 --> 33:44.775
Good.

33:44.843 --> 33:46.276
How's Haverill?

33:47.479 --> 33:48.605
O.K.

33:48.680 --> 33:50.648
I'm doing this for you.

33:50.715 --> 33:52.182
Shut up, Duane.

33:52.250 --> 33:53.239
Let's go.

34:01.660 --> 34:04.288
That's one of them.
That's Tito.

34:04.362 --> 34:05.624
Which guy?

34:05.697 --> 34:07.688
The Puerto Rican.
He was driving.

34:07.766 --> 34:09.130
Ray's just inside the door.

34:09.199 --> 34:10.632
The other guy.

34:10.702 --> 34:12.135
He's nobody.

34:12.203 --> 34:14.137
Take him down.
Biker jacket.

34:14.205 --> 34:16.036
Got it.

34:18.944 --> 34:20.103
I'm on it.

34:31.922 --> 34:34.551
Don't make a sound.
Keep your mouth shut.

34:37.963 --> 34:39.293
Call Ray.

34:39.364 --> 34:40.626
I don't know Ray.

34:40.699 --> 34:43.167
Call for Ray,
or I'll blow your brains out.

34:43.234 --> 34:44.326
Yo, Ray!

34:47.237 --> 34:49.399
Get your hands up in the air!

34:49.474 --> 34:50.804
Keep your hands in the air!

34:52.978 --> 34:55.844
You're taking a ride
downtown, right? Let's go.

35:13.231 --> 35:15.290
I'm putting in a 28.

35:15.367 --> 35:17.062
I can't work my shift tonight.

35:17.135 --> 35:18.568
You probably don't know why.

35:18.636 --> 35:20.069
I probably don't need to.

35:20.138 --> 35:22.402
Howie Hornbeck
was a friend of mine.

35:22.474 --> 35:23.907
He was a great guy.

35:23.975 --> 35:25.875
I had more laughs with Howie...

35:25.944 --> 35:28.640
than anybody I ever worked with.

35:28.713 --> 35:31.682
That man knew how
to have a good time.

35:33.318 --> 35:35.878
And now it's over.

35:37.288 --> 35:38.380
I'm sorry.

35:38.456 --> 35:39.582
Oh, you're sorry.

35:41.626 --> 35:43.560
You know that cup you broke?

35:46.331 --> 35:49.027
Howie gave me that cup.

35:51.936 --> 35:54.700
That was my tit cup!

36:01.679 --> 36:03.510
Detective Lesniak...

36:03.581 --> 36:05.981
Detective Abruzzo on 2.

36:06.051 --> 36:07.450
Tell him I'm not here.

36:20.832 --> 36:22.424
Hi. It's me, Sandy.

36:22.500 --> 36:24.764
Do I have to look at pictures?

36:24.836 --> 36:25.825
No.

36:25.904 --> 36:28.930
We picked up the guys
Duane told us about.

36:29.007 --> 36:30.941
If he I.D. S them in lineup...

36:31.009 --> 36:32.442
there'll probably be an arrest.

36:32.510 --> 36:34.239
Do I have to leave now?

36:34.312 --> 36:36.075
No. Not right away.

36:36.147 --> 36:37.512
How's your headache?

36:39.084 --> 36:41.678
I don't know where to go.

36:43.421 --> 36:46.356
Everything's just so weird.
I just...

36:46.424 --> 36:49.291
I didn't know
it all gets like this.

36:49.360 --> 36:51.851
You got to hold yourself
together now, Sandy.

36:51.930 --> 36:55.331
I just want to be gone
from all this.

36:56.868 --> 36:59.302
Want to be with your sister
in Florida?

36:59.370 --> 37:01.702
I don't have any money.

37:03.942 --> 37:07.378
If I could get it for you,
would you go?

37:07.445 --> 37:09.436
Yeah. I'd get out so fast.

37:09.514 --> 37:12.278
I'm gonna see what I can do.

37:12.350 --> 37:15.717
Tiffany... You said that
the charity would bury Tiffany.

37:15.787 --> 37:18.187
Right.
The church'll bury Tiffany.

37:20.425 --> 37:22.359
If you got me that money...

37:22.427 --> 37:24.691
maybe I should use that for her.

37:24.762 --> 37:26.354
That would be your choice.

37:26.431 --> 37:29.662
But I think you should
go to your sister's.

37:32.237 --> 37:34.797
I'm gonna lie back down.

37:36.207 --> 37:37.333
O.K.

37:40.578 --> 37:43.342
I'll let you know what happens.

37:43.414 --> 37:44.346
O.K.

37:59.764 --> 38:01.857
That's the other one.
That's Tito.

38:01.933 --> 38:03.525
Say the number.

38:03.601 --> 38:05.432
Number 2.
You got them both.

38:05.503 --> 38:06.936
All but number 2 go.

38:07.005 --> 38:09.439
All right.
Everybody else, come on.

38:09.507 --> 38:10.667
Let's go.

38:10.742 --> 38:12.733
What will you do to him?

38:12.810 --> 38:14.277
I'll charge him with murder.

38:14.345 --> 38:17.075
Can't you mess him up
or something?

38:17.148 --> 38:19.082
Can I talk to you, John?

38:19.150 --> 38:20.082
Sure.

38:20.151 --> 38:21.584
When you're done
with Martinez...

38:21.653 --> 38:23.587
I need you in my office.

38:23.655 --> 38:24.917
Is my money coming?

38:24.989 --> 38:26.251
It's on its way.

38:31.329 --> 38:32.591
What's going on?

38:32.664 --> 38:34.131
It's about this guy's money.

38:34.199 --> 38:36.463
500 now,
500 after the grand jury...

38:36.534 --> 38:37.865
1,000 after the trial.

38:37.936 --> 38:40.200
I'd like to get Sandy a deuce.

38:40.271 --> 38:41.704
Between her and the boyfriend.

38:41.773 --> 38:43.764
Can't give it to her, huh?

38:43.841 --> 38:45.274
No. He made the I. D...

38:45.343 --> 38:47.277
so they'll want him in court.

38:47.345 --> 38:49.939
Well, she did give up
that Tito's name.

38:50.014 --> 38:51.447
What's going on, James?

38:51.516 --> 38:54.314
She's talking about
getting away from this guy...

38:54.385 --> 38:56.148
going to her sister's.

38:56.221 --> 38:58.655
Maybe she'd use the money
to cop...

38:58.723 --> 39:01.283
but I'd like to make it bus fare.

39:01.359 --> 39:02.553
Get it from him.

39:02.627 --> 39:05.152
I have to get Duane
to give it up?

39:05.230 --> 39:06.162
O.K.

39:06.231 --> 39:07.664
All right. Thanks.

39:07.732 --> 39:08.721
O.K.

39:25.583 --> 39:28.416
Yeah. Come on in.

39:28.486 --> 39:30.545
Uh... close the door.

39:43.534 --> 39:46.469
You're transferred
to Borough dispatch duty, John.

39:46.537 --> 39:48.095
Steady day tour.

39:48.172 --> 39:49.935
Effective tomorrow.

39:53.378 --> 39:56.313
I wish I had a way
to reach out...

39:56.381 --> 39:59.009
but I don't have the juice
to help you.

40:01.252 --> 40:02.685
Think it's just Haverill?

40:02.754 --> 40:05.518
No. It's got to go past him.

40:05.590 --> 40:07.387
He doesn't have the guts...

40:07.458 --> 40:09.221
to do it on his own.

40:14.179 --> 40:17.273
Take a minute.
I'm gonna get some coffee.

40:17.348 --> 40:19.111
No. It's O.K.

40:23.521 --> 40:26.115
You've been a great cop for me.

40:31.963 --> 40:32.895
Thanks.

40:32.964 --> 40:34.397
I'm sorry.

40:56.321 --> 40:57.720
What's going on?

41:01.860 --> 41:02.849
Transferred.

41:06.364 --> 41:08.298
Radio dispatch
down at the Borough.

41:11.202 --> 41:13.466
Same shift
he puts a knife in your back...

41:13.538 --> 41:15.972
he's up here
on a case you cleared.

41:16.040 --> 41:17.974
Let me talk to this asshole.

41:18.042 --> 41:19.304
Andy...

41:19.377 --> 41:20.844
Sign all three documents.

41:20.912 --> 41:22.539
O.K.

41:22.614 --> 41:24.878
What are my limits
on spending this?

41:24.949 --> 41:26.541
Your good sense.

41:26.618 --> 41:28.313
I need to talk to you.

41:28.386 --> 41:29.648
What is it, Sipowicz?

41:29.721 --> 41:30.983
What do you think?

41:35.226 --> 41:36.955
Kelly's transfer's a settled matter.

41:37.028 --> 41:38.495
I think
maybe you're forgetting...

41:38.563 --> 41:40.997
I saw you walk
from the DiSico hit.

41:41.065 --> 41:42.999
You think
I was walking around...

41:43.067 --> 41:46.002
waiting for you
to drop that on my head?

41:46.070 --> 41:48.504
I went on record
with the appropriate parties...

41:48.573 --> 41:51.007
as to what happened
at that incident.

41:51.075 --> 41:53.339
I'm off the hook, Sipowicz.

41:53.411 --> 41:55.675
You want to call downtown
about it?

41:55.747 --> 41:57.180
We got free phones.

41:58.917 --> 42:01.351
Those people
that took you off the hook...

42:01.419 --> 42:03.683
those are the people
that want Kelly?

42:03.755 --> 42:04.983
He lied at trial.

42:05.056 --> 42:06.284
Everybody lies at trials.

42:06.357 --> 42:07.790
He embarrassed the job.

42:07.859 --> 42:09.121
He embarrassed the job?

42:11.596 --> 42:14.394
And piss runs uphill,
right, Captain?

42:14.465 --> 42:16.729
And you're a stand-up guy.

42:21.806 --> 42:23.535
Where's my other 200?

42:23.608 --> 42:25.235
Sandy gets that.

42:25.310 --> 42:26.743
I'll take care of Sandy.

42:26.811 --> 42:28.176
That $500 was for me.

42:28.246 --> 42:29.679
Hey, lower your voice.

42:29.747 --> 42:31.180
Come over here, Duane.

42:34.419 --> 42:36.853
If Sandy wants to see you
tomorrow...

42:36.921 --> 42:39.617
she can put her 200
with your 300.

42:39.691 --> 42:40.953
Leave her alone tonight.

42:41.025 --> 42:42.925
You trying to break us up?

42:44.162 --> 42:45.595
Listen to me, Duane.

42:45.663 --> 42:47.927
You make a stink
about this money...

42:47.999 --> 42:50.433
and when I check you
into that motel...

42:50.501 --> 42:52.935
I'll lock the door
and kick your ass.

42:57.575 --> 42:59.668
I asked you not to do that.

42:59.744 --> 43:01.006
They're screwing you.

43:01.079 --> 43:03.343
I know that.
They get my badge...

43:03.414 --> 43:04.676
but I don't beg.

43:04.749 --> 43:06.478
What should I do?

43:06.551 --> 43:07.745
Ride it out.

43:07.819 --> 43:09.081
They will find something.

43:09.153 --> 43:11.485
They can't find their heads
up their asses.

43:11.556 --> 43:13.990
Look how hard
they're trying to nail me.

43:14.058 --> 43:15.821
They will find something...

43:15.893 --> 43:18.521
and I am not answering phones
until they do.

43:24.502 --> 43:26.265
Ah, John...

43:32.777 --> 43:34.540
You know I'm right.

43:41.285 --> 43:45.221
I thought I'd be 65
when I left this job...

43:45.289 --> 43:48.554
kicking and screaming
for that age waiver.

43:57.101 --> 43:58.625
Thanks, buddy.

44:00.038 --> 44:01.562
Back at you.

44:05.143 --> 44:08.704
Tell Fancy I'll clean out
the locker later, O. K?

44:25.463 --> 44:26.896
- Hey.
- Hey.

44:26.964 --> 44:29.831
Thanks for that advice.
He gave the money up.

44:29.901 --> 44:31.835
She's going to a separate motel.

44:31.903 --> 44:34.997
Good. Listen, James,
I'm leaving the job.

44:36.107 --> 44:37.369
What do you mean?

44:37.442 --> 44:39.376
They're putting me
on Borough dispatch...

44:39.444 --> 44:41.036
till they get rid of me.

44:41.112 --> 44:43.046
Don't leave, man.
Don't quit, John.

44:43.114 --> 44:44.843
Listen, James,
you're gonna be O.K.

44:44.916 --> 44:47.077
Just keep doing
what we talk about.

44:47.151 --> 44:48.914
O. K?

44:48.986 --> 44:50.920
Yeah.

44:50.988 --> 44:52.922
I can still call you, though.

44:52.990 --> 44:54.582
You better believe it.

44:54.659 --> 44:55.591
O.K.

44:57.161 --> 45:00.927
All right. I got to take
this girl her money now.

45:02.166 --> 45:03.428
I'll see you.

45:03.501 --> 45:04.433
Yeah.

45:14.345 --> 45:15.437
Hey.

45:15.513 --> 45:19.449
Uh, Howie Hornbeck's wife's
on line 2.

45:19.517 --> 45:20.950
What will you tell her?

45:21.018 --> 45:22.610
I'll take care of it.

45:31.752 --> 45:33.185
Good night, Sarge.

45:33.253 --> 45:34.515
Good night, Kelly.
