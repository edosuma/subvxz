00:00.884 --> 00:04.564
[Lana] No, I just wanna make sure
we're both totally clear about this.

00:04.937 --> 00:10.116
Yes, Lana, you've made it totally,
very nearly insultingly, clear.

00:10.236 --> 00:12.734
Because this is only my parents
meeting their grandchild.

00:12.792 --> 00:13.724
And oh, by the way...

00:13.844 --> 00:14.623
this is her father.

00:14.743 --> 00:16.044
Yeah, it's--
It's not "meet my boyfriend,"

00:16.113 --> 00:17.731
it's not, "meet
my future husband."

00:17.851 --> 00:19.452
Nobody's guessing
who's coming to dinner.

00:19.519 --> 00:23.354

00:23.423 --> 00:25.323
[A.J. crying]
[Lana] So, just to be clear,

00:25.392 --> 00:27.091
we're clear?
Oh, my God.

00:27.160 --> 00:30.061
Oh, my God!
Hey! Shut up!

00:30.130 --> 00:33.007
Sir, is there a problem here?
Yes! Where the hell have you been?

00:33.127 --> 00:35.349
Here. And if you want to
save yourself some trips,

00:35.469 --> 00:38.803
let's uh, make it a pitcher.
Uh, we don't even have pitchers.

00:38.872 --> 00:40.371
Well, then, I don't know
what to tell you.

00:40.440 --> 00:43.107
Maybe rinse
out a little trash can.

00:43.176 --> 00:45.777
Also, my parents
aren't big drinkers?

00:45.846 --> 00:47.512
[Archer] Yeah, they're
like huge nerds, right?

00:47.581 --> 00:49.681
Uh, no.
They're academics!

00:49.801 --> 00:51.347
"Tomato, Tomato."

00:51.467 --> 00:55.453
My mom, Claudette, is a professor
of public policy at U.C. Berkeley,

00:55.522 --> 00:57.956
with a focus on feminist issues.
Yikes.

00:58.024 --> 01:00.492
Glad I didn't waste suitcase
space on that barrel of monkeys.

01:00.560 --> 01:03.229
Shut up. And my father,
Lemuel, is a microbiologist--

01:03.281 --> 01:05.122
who might be up for the Nobel Prize.
Holy shit.

01:05.183 --> 01:07.372
Yeah, right?
[laughs] Right!

01:07.492 --> 01:08.717
What happened to you?

Oh, and one more,

Although what the shit?

01:19.163 --> 01:21.297
I'm actually kinda nervous.
Ugh. [sighs]

01:21.365 --> 01:24.400
Me too, actually,

01:24.469 --> 01:27.436
because my parents think
I'm still working on my PhD...

01:27.505 --> 01:29.105
at Columbia.
[belches]

01:29.173 --> 01:31.006
In environmental science.
[laughs] What?

01:31.075 --> 01:33.209
They don't know you're a spy?

01:33.277 --> 01:36.078
No! And if you tell them I am,
I will literally murder you--

01:41.085 --> 01:43.352

So, serious up,

01:43.421 --> 01:44.720

this whole arrangement, so--

01:44.789 --> 01:47.189
[sighs]
Serious up.

01:47.258 --> 01:49.138
Lana, once I meet them,
I'm sure they'll find me

01:49.160 --> 01:51.927
[British accent]
...utterly charming.

01:52.414 --> 01:54.314

Yes, he's getting
his master's, too,

01:55.717 --> 01:59.319
and he's nice--
and I said that already,

01:59.388 --> 02:01.454
and... I'm sure he's just...
caught in traffic.

02:01.523 --> 02:03.924
Hmm. He could have
walked here by now.

02:03.992 --> 02:06.526

you remember Archer?

Yeah, Lana.
Don't do that...

Nope.

Really? Well, that
must be fascinating!

04:00.009 --> 04:02.036
Well, everybody thinks
that, but--

04:10.814 --> 04:14.905
of modern Serbian nationalism?
Mm... nope.

there's no reason
to tell Lana about it.

approve.

07:07.731 --> 07:09.531
I've never worn a condom, ever,

07:09.600 --> 07:13.168

agreement between you and I,

07:13.237 --> 07:15.771
is that at no time
will our penises touch,

07:15.839 --> 07:17.873

09:32.124 --> 09:34.558
[car engine starts]

09:34.627 --> 09:37.428
Lana, this is all just crazy,
why does he have a gun?

09:37.496 --> 09:39.263
And why is he driving?
I should be driving!

09:39.332 --> 09:41.265
No, Daddy, Archer should drive.

09:41.334 --> 09:42.333
He's actually
pretty great at it.

09:42.401 --> 09:44.368
[teeny tiny,
Beaker-like noises]

09:44.437 --> 09:46.303
When he's not busy ejaculating.

09:46.372 --> 09:49.240
Not in my Mustang, you don't!

09:49.308 --> 09:51.308
But, seriously,
what's wrong with him?

09:51.377 --> 09:54.445
Guys, this is, this is
the-- the car from--

09:54.513 --> 09:56.714
<i>Bullitt, </i> we know,
and if you'd go already,

09:56.782 --> 09:59.416
maybe later I'll dress up
like Steve McQueen for you!

09:59.485 --> 10:02.019
Ew, that's not even
what it's about.

10:02.088 --> 10:03.169
Plus your hands are too big.

10:03.189 --> 10:04.755
Go!
But speaking of McQueen,

10:04.824 --> 10:06.156
if there was ever a time
to wear the Tactleneck--

10:06.225 --> 10:08.892
Go!
Okay! Hang on!

10:08.961 --> 10:11.278
[Lemuel] Easy, easy!

10:11.364 --> 10:12.730
[Krieger] Easy...

10:12.798 --> 10:16.166
Easy...

10:16.235 --> 10:19.036
Easy--
[Pam] Will you shut up?

10:19.105 --> 10:21.105
We're only going
one mile an hour!

10:21.173 --> 10:22.706
[Cheryl]
If that! Jesus...

10:22.775 --> 10:24.642
Aw, shush and push!

10:24.710 --> 10:26.277
You guys all better
be pushing back there!

10:26.345 --> 10:27.505
We are!
[Cheryl] I am pushing.

10:27.546 --> 10:28.946
Swearsies, realsies.
I push.

10:29.015 --> 10:31.582
Son of a bitch...

10:31.651 --> 10:34.618
then I dunno why this heap
of shit's not going faster.

10:34.687 --> 10:36.587
Well, first of all,
I think you mean

10:36.656 --> 10:40.190
heap of bitchin',
and second of all, hang on.

10:40.259 --> 10:41.325
[brake moves]
[Pam] Wh--?

10:41.394 --> 10:43.994
the frickin' brake was on?

10:44.063 --> 10:47.097
[Cheryl laughs]
God--

10:47.166 --> 10:49.183
Dammit, Archer!
[laughing]

10:49.268 --> 10:51.435
[Archer] Whoo!
[Lana] Archer!

10:51.487 --> 10:53.604
[Lemuel] You're going
too fast, you idiot.

10:53.689 --> 10:56.440
[Archer] Idiot? Who kept his
life's work in his frickin' house,

10:56.525 --> 10:58.475
apparently without any kind
of backup whatsoever?

10:58.544 --> 11:01.161
Uh, yeah, that's actually
a good point.

11:01.247 --> 11:02.513
I couldn't keep
my work at the lab.

11:02.581 --> 11:04.448
It's potentially worth billions!

11:04.500 --> 11:06.333
People would literally
kill for it!

11:06.419 --> 11:08.085
[gunfire] Whoa, Whoa.

11:08.120 --> 11:10.181
Case in point.

11:10.301 --> 11:12.526
Well, even if I'm not family...

11:12.646 --> 11:15.008
Oh, my God, okay...

11:15.544 --> 11:17.461
What's the deal with this algae?

11:17.513 --> 11:21.432
I found a way to use
it as bio-fuel!

11:21.500 --> 11:23.434
Am I supposed to know
what that means, or...?

11:23.502 --> 11:25.602
As a replacement
for fossil fuels!

11:25.671 --> 11:27.137
Oh.

11:27.206 --> 11:30.774
Oh, my God--
Duh-hoi.

11:30.810 --> 11:33.491
[Lemuel] Under the right conditions,
the algae reproduce infinitely,

11:33.562 --> 11:36.697
and the only by-product
of burning it, is water.

11:36.782 --> 11:39.817
Holy shit, I'm surprised
nobody's killed you already.

11:39.869 --> 11:42.030
[Lemuel] That's why I had to
keep my research a secret.

11:42.071 --> 11:44.738
[Lemuel] Can you imagine what this
will mean to Big Oil? Or OPEC?

11:44.824 --> 11:47.658
Well, there's no need to be racist.
How is the acronym

11:47.743 --> 11:50.494
for the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries racist?

11:50.546 --> 11:51.128
[Archer]
Oh, that's what that means?

11:51.163 --> 11:52.830
[All] Oh!

11:52.882 --> 11:54.998
Goddammit.

11:55.067 --> 11:56.333
This is an American icon!

11:58.637 --> 12:01.505
You Philistines!

12:01.574 --> 12:05.376
Hey, I know, let's, um--
uh-- teabag Dr. Seuss.

12:05.444 --> 12:08.762
Yeah, great idea. I'll hold him down.
Huh?

12:08.848 --> 12:10.848
Look here, Archer, I've told
you about my research.

12:10.850 --> 12:13.183
How about telling me why
the hell you carry a gun?

12:13.235 --> 12:14.568
Yeah speaking of, I'm out.

12:14.653 --> 12:16.320
Lemme hold yours
while you reload me.

12:16.355 --> 12:17.404
Hold your what?
Uh--

12:20.192 --> 12:22.109
Lana, come on!
<i>Zona peligrosa!</i>

12:22.194 --> 12:23.911
What is he talking about?

12:23.996 --> 12:26.530
[sighs]

12:26.599 --> 12:29.416
What in the--?
Lana Anthony Kane!

12:29.502 --> 12:33.003
Okay, so--
[Archer laughing]

12:33.038 --> 12:35.339
Anthony?
After Susan B.!

12:35.374 --> 12:38.175
Oh, right,
our ugliest president.

12:38.244 --> 12:40.294
Lana, why the hell
do you have a gun?

12:40.379 --> 12:42.045
That's not how we raised you!

12:42.098 --> 12:44.181
[Lana] I know, Daddy. I know.

12:44.216 --> 12:45.966
[Lana] So, about my PhD...

12:46.051 --> 12:49.103
[chuckling]

12:49.188 --> 12:50.804
How is this funny?

12:50.890 --> 12:53.223
What, seriously?

12:53.275 --> 12:56.196
Um, in every possible way.

13:04.758 --> 13:05.638
[Lemuel] You're a spy?

13:05.659 --> 13:08.163
[Lana] Yes, but I can explain!

13:09.149 --> 13:12.779
Oh, you're going to explain lying
to me and your mother all these years.

13:12.899 --> 13:14.599
and could you please
not drive my Mustang

13:14.668 --> 13:17.268
like a complete
ass-bucket!

13:17.354 --> 13:20.188
Okay, Lem, I think maybe
you're transferring a little.

13:20.273 --> 13:22.774
You're not angry at me.
You're angry at Lana.

13:22.826 --> 13:25.681
I'm well aware
of at whom I'm angry!

13:27.047 --> 13:28.613
But thank you for reminding him.

13:28.665 --> 13:31.519
Yeah, think of me as a mediator.

13:32.786 --> 13:35.787
And spying for whom, exactly?

13:35.839 --> 13:37.455
I hope to God
it's at least for America!

13:37.541 --> 13:40.008
Who else would I be spying for?
How should I know?

13:40.093 --> 13:41.793
All of a sudden I'm talking
to a total stranger!

13:41.878 --> 13:43.628
Lana? How does
that make you feel?

13:43.680 --> 13:46.297
Like I'm gonna shoot you?

13:46.383 --> 13:48.316
Yeah, get in line.

13:49.719 --> 13:50.935
Daddy, of course it's America.

13:50.971 --> 13:52.887
Long story short, these days

13:52.973 --> 13:56.274
we're sort of,
contractors for the CIA.

13:56.309 --> 13:59.027
The CIA?
Did you just drop in on your way to overthrow

13:59.112 --> 14:01.279
a democratically elected
government somewhere?

14:01.314 --> 14:04.032
Lem, let's try to avoid using sarcasm.
I wasn't.

14:04.117 --> 14:06.067
You see? This is why
I never told you!

14:06.153 --> 14:08.486
[Lana] I knew you
wouldn't understand!

14:08.572 --> 14:10.188
[Lemuel] Because you could've
been a great scientist, Lana!

14:10.257 --> 14:13.106
How could you just throw away
your God-given talent?

14:15.162 --> 14:17.785
But it wasn't my talent,
Daddy...

14:21.718 --> 14:23.218
You and Mom just wanted
it to be.

14:23.303 --> 14:25.170
Oh, come on, now.

14:25.255 --> 14:26.671
You used to love going
to all those science fairs!

14:26.756 --> 14:29.174
I used to hate it!

14:29.259 --> 14:31.176
Remember, I always threw up
in the car on the way there?

14:31.228 --> 14:34.262
[crying]

14:34.347 --> 14:36.648
I'm sorry...

14:36.683 --> 14:38.683
Oh, goddammit--
Lemuel!

14:38.735 --> 14:40.151
[Lemuel] From excitement!

14:40.187 --> 14:42.854
[Lana] From terror, but
I was always so afraid

14:42.906 --> 14:45.023
of letting you and Mom down,
that I--

14:45.075 --> 14:47.158
[tearing up] I couldn't
ever tell you how I felt.

14:47.194 --> 14:50.862
Hey. C'mon, now. You could
never let us down, honey.

14:50.914 --> 14:52.664
I-- I hope you know that.
[sniffs]

14:52.699 --> 14:55.250
Really?
Oh, Lana,

14:55.335 --> 14:58.336
we'll always be proud of you,
and we'll always love you,

14:58.371 --> 15:01.456
even when you make stupid,
stupid, stupid choices,

15:01.541 --> 15:04.542
like him.
Aww.

15:04.594 --> 15:06.711
[Archer] Well, I think we've
made some real progress here,

15:06.796 --> 15:08.930
and I'd say, we've got about

15:09.015 --> 15:10.882
30 seconds before
the engine locks up,

15:10.934 --> 15:14.969
so does anyone
have a plan? Anyone?

15:15.055 --> 15:16.604
Guys, c'mon, there's
no dumb ideas.

15:16.690 --> 15:18.489
[Cheryl gasps]

15:18.558 --> 15:19.891
What if we grease the tires?

15:19.976 --> 15:23.175
How would that possibly help?

15:25.604 --> 15:29.271
Hey, yeah, toss out all your empties,
that will get rid of some weight, huh?

15:30.937 --> 15:33.838
[winded]
Toss out... everything!

15:33.907 --> 15:37.075
We've gotta get rid of
some of this weight!

15:37.143 --> 15:38.109
[Cyril] Well, the speakers
are obviously the--

15:38.178 --> 15:40.245
No!
For the love of God, man,

15:40.313 --> 15:42.680
are you quite literally insane?
Sorry.

15:42.749 --> 15:44.015
[speaks in Japanese] Shut up.

15:44.084 --> 15:46.451
What about all these
bowling balls?

15:46.519 --> 15:48.953
What? Yes, you ding-dongs!

15:49.022 --> 15:51.222
Throw out the goddamn
bowling balls!

15:51.291 --> 15:53.091
Okay! Jesus!

15:53.159 --> 15:53.992
[grunts]

15:57.230 --> 15:58.329
[glass shatters]

15:58.398 --> 15:59.264
[laughs]

16:03.069 --> 16:05.937
[sighs]
And that's how they all died.

16:05.989 --> 16:09.157
[Lemuel]
That's your plan? To ram it?

16:09.242 --> 16:11.326
[Archer] Yeah, it's
called a pit maneuver,

16:11.411 --> 16:12.777
[Archer] I've done it,
like, a million times.

16:12.829 --> 16:14.445
Like, three times.

16:14.531 --> 16:15.914
And Daddy, when they crash,

16:15.949 --> 16:17.115
they're probably gonna
come out firing,

16:17.167 --> 16:19.667
so get down on the floor,
and stay there!

16:19.753 --> 16:20.868
What about you?
Don't worry about me.

16:20.954 --> 16:22.704
This is what I do, [gun clicks]

16:22.789 --> 16:23.705
and I'm actually pretty
great at it.

16:23.790 --> 16:25.290
Ehh.
Shut up.

16:25.342 --> 16:27.225
Daddy, floor.

16:27.294 --> 16:28.026
Okay, hang on!

16:30.063 --> 16:31.763
Actually wait, hang on.
What?

16:31.831 --> 16:33.898
Lem, what was the special thing?

16:33.967 --> 16:34.882
What?
[Archer] In the hot tub!

16:34.968 --> 16:36.684
Archer, I think the less said

16:36.770 --> 16:37.769
about the hot tub incident,
the better!

16:37.804 --> 16:39.554
Shut up. what's
the special thing

16:39.639 --> 16:40.672
you two wanted to share with me?

16:40.740 --> 16:42.607
The Kane family reunion!

16:42.676 --> 16:44.058
Wait, what?
Yeah,

16:44.144 --> 16:46.060
we do it every year, it's huge,

16:46.146 --> 16:49.063
and we told her
to invite you, but--

16:49.149 --> 16:51.816
Daddy!
Lana, the man may be a total idiot,

16:51.901 --> 16:53.484
but he is the father
of your child.

16:53.570 --> 16:55.954
Yeah, Lana!

16:55.989 --> 16:57.789
So are we talking like,
a barbecue, or--?

16:57.824 --> 17:01.035
Archer!
Okay! Lana!

17:09.102 --> 17:10.501
And if it's a barbecue,
are the Kanes a brisket crowd,

17:10.569 --> 17:12.675
or pulled pork?

17:13.873 --> 17:16.779
Brisket.
[sighs] Lame.

17:17.644 --> 17:18.608
[Pam] Don't shoot!

17:18.678 --> 17:20.744
Don't shoot!

17:20.814 --> 17:23.531
Please, don't-- Darryl?
Pam?

17:23.652 --> 17:25.650
[laughs]
Oh, my God,

17:25.719 --> 17:27.785
I used to beat this bitch's ass

17:27.854 --> 17:29.787
at fight club, like,
all the time!

17:29.856 --> 17:31.689
- Sup?
- Hey, guys.

17:31.758 --> 17:33.891
Pff, like, three times.

17:33.960 --> 17:35.459
Now, what're you doin'
bowling bowlin' balls

17:35.468 --> 17:36.733
in the damn street?

17:36.762 --> 17:38.029
Long story, funny story,

17:38.098 --> 17:40.452
and I'll tell you guys
all about it over beers

17:40.572 --> 17:42.466
at the nearest titty bar, my treat.

17:42.586 --> 17:44.606
Titties ain't gonna fix my car, poovee.

17:44.726 --> 17:47.288
No, but Beard McBoggeyes over there will

17:47.408 --> 17:49.073
and he'll install
a nitrous tank,

17:49.142 --> 17:51.275
so you don't have to drive
around town like a giant pussy.

17:51.344 --> 17:52.377
Won't ya, Krieger?

17:52.445 --> 17:54.078
Yep!
Yep, yep, yep!

17:54.147 --> 17:56.997
So c'mon, let's go make
it rain Pammy.

17:57.117 --> 17:58.449
What about them?

17:58.518 --> 18:00.923
[sighs]
Honestly don't care.

18:13.950 --> 18:15.533
Reloading!
Archer, cover me!

18:15.602 --> 18:17.869
Wait, what?
Archer?

18:17.937 --> 18:19.604
What the--?
Slater?

18:19.672 --> 18:22.807
[sighs]
Ta-daa.

18:22.876 --> 18:24.642
With a baby in the house?

18:24.711 --> 18:27.011
We didn't know you were there,

18:27.080 --> 18:29.981
which was obviously an
operational failure on our end.

18:30.050 --> 18:31.883
Ethan!
[Archer] Yeah, Ethan!

18:31.951 --> 18:33.651
And don't be shitty, Archer,
you dick.

18:33.720 --> 18:35.653
You killed one of my guys.

18:35.722 --> 18:38.322
Yeah, was that shot not insane?

18:38.391 --> 18:40.124
What is insane is the CIA stealing
my father's research, Slater!

18:40.193 --> 18:42.126
Why?

18:42.195 --> 18:44.695
Because, Dr. Kane,
your research has jeopardized

18:44.764 --> 18:46.597
our national security.

18:46.666 --> 18:49.400
What? What do you mean?
How?

18:49.469 --> 18:51.035
Because if you think the
Middle East is messed up now,

18:51.104 --> 18:53.137
just wait until nobody
needs their oil.

18:53.206 --> 18:54.567
Man, you guys
are so big picture...

18:54.574 --> 18:56.741
No, wait, you can't--

18:56.810 --> 18:58.276
that was a lifetime of work
for my father!

18:58.344 --> 19:00.545
Yeah, yeah. Dr. Kane,

19:00.613 --> 19:01.379
do you have online banking?

19:01.448 --> 19:03.281
I-- yes,
but--

19:03.349 --> 19:05.783
So, if you wanna go ahead
and check your account balance?

19:05.852 --> 19:08.953
[phone beeps]
Huh.

19:09.022 --> 19:10.655
Well, I can tell you right now,

19:10.723 --> 19:11.756
this doesn't
come anywhere close--

19:11.825 --> 19:13.791
That amount,
direct-deposited

19:13.860 --> 19:15.893
every month,
for the rest of your life.

19:15.962 --> 19:19.831
Every month?
Well, Mr. Slater, I--

19:19.899 --> 19:20.565
I think we've
got ourselves a deal.

19:20.633 --> 19:23.067
Daddy, no!

19:23.136 --> 19:24.202
What about the algae,
so we don't have to burn

19:24.270 --> 19:25.770
fossil fuels?

19:25.839 --> 19:27.004
Honey, forget
about fossil fuels.

19:27.073 --> 19:28.673
We're gonna be able
to burn money.

19:28.741 --> 19:30.675
[laughs]
[sighs]

19:30.743 --> 19:34.245
Happy?
What, like in general?

19:34.314 --> 19:35.933
Because yes.

19:37.450 --> 19:40.118
[Lana] So, listen...

19:40.186 --> 19:41.719
I wanna thank you,
for trying to save

19:41.788 --> 19:42.920
my dad's research,
and even though

19:42.989 --> 19:44.822
I'm obviously
still furious about

19:44.891 --> 19:45.723
the hot tub incident,
and will be, probably,

19:45.792 --> 19:47.758
for years to come,

19:47.827 --> 19:49.794
I can see how you--
you, Archer,

19:49.863 --> 19:52.130
could have misconstrued
the situation,

19:52.198 --> 19:53.931
and even though it's kinda
hard for me to admit it,

19:54.000 --> 19:56.160
you are family to me,
and not just because of A.J.

19:56.280 --> 19:59.640
and I realize now that I should
have invited you to the family reunion, so

19:59.760 --> 20:01.474
I'm sorry.

20:02.014 --> 20:03.089
Sorry that I hurt your feelings.

20:03.209 --> 20:05.476
Well, thanks.

20:05.545 --> 20:07.145
I accept your apology.

20:14.988 --> 20:17.167
Sorry I tried to spit-roast
your mom.
