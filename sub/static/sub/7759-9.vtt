01:49.777 --> 01:51.912
- I'M SORRY,
ARE WE KEEPING YOU UP?

01:51.945 --> 01:56.284
- NO.
IT'S THE BUSINESS.

01:56.317 --> 01:57.718
TOILING AWAY,
DAY AND NIGHT,

01:57.751 --> 01:58.752
IT'S NOT THE SAME

AT WERTSHAFTER'S.

02:01.222 --> 02:04.658

YOU'RE A SUCCESS.

02:04.692 --> 02:06.894
- NOT THAT I'VE HAD MUCH TIME
TO ENJOY IT.

02:06.927 --> 02:09.797
- WHAT YOU NEED IS SOMETHING
TO KEEP YOUR EYELIDS OPEN.

04:00.774 --> 04:02.876
AND I'VE EVEN DATED A FEW.

04:02.910 --> 04:04.878
MORE THAN A FEW.

04:04.912 --> 04:06.013
THE ONLY PROBLEM IS...

04:06.046 --> 04:08.015
THEY'RE NOT BEN.

04:08.048 --> 04:09.417
I CAN'T STOP THINKING
ABOUT HIM.

04:09.450 --> 04:10.751
I'M OBSESSED.
- AND I'M...

04:10.784 --> 04:12.320
TRYING TO EAT.

- IT'S CLASSIC
END-OF-THE-AFFAIR REMORSE.

04:14.355 --> 04:15.188
- MADE WORSE BY THE FACT THAT

04:15.222 --> 04:16.890
YOU DON'T HAVE ANYONE
TO REPLACE HIM.

04:16.924 --> 04:19.493
- IT'S MY OWN FAULT.

04:19.527 --> 04:22.029
I SHOULDN'T HAVE LET MYSELF BE
INFLUENCED BY OTHER PEOPLE.

04:22.062 --> 04:23.631
- WELL, YOU OBVIOUSLY
HAD YOUR DOUBTS

04:23.664 --> 04:25.566
OR ELSE YOU'D HAVE TOLD US
ALL TO GO FUCK OURSELVES.

04:25.599 --> 04:27.901
- THERE'S PROBABLY
SOME TRUTH TO THAT, MICHAEL.

04:27.935 --> 04:30.070
- DO YOU THINK IT'S TOO LATE?

04:30.103 --> 04:32.373
- YOU KNOW, I ORDERED
MY EGGS WITH BACON...

04:32.406 --> 04:35.509
- OKAY.
- NOT GROUP THERAPY.

04:35.543 --> 04:37.445
- OH.

04:37.478 --> 04:41.949
- IF YOU WANT BEN BACK,
GO FUCKING GET HIM.

04:41.982 --> 04:43.351
- HEY!

04:43.384 --> 04:47.355
YOUR SIDE OF BACON.

04:47.388 --> 04:49.390
OH, WELL.

MONDAY NIGHT, ZITI NIGHT.

05:27.728 --> 05:29.963

SO I CAN BE FAT AND SINGLE.

05:29.997 --> 05:31.732
- [giggles]

05:31.765 --> 05:32.833

SHE'S DRIVING ME
OUT OF MY MIND.

05:34.101 --> 05:35.102
[glass shatters]

05:35.135 --> 05:37.104
I TOLD YOU TWO TO BEHAVE!

05:37.137 --> 05:38.839
- HE DID IT.

05:38.872 --> 05:39.840
- NO, HE DID.

05:39.873 --> 05:40.974
- FAGGOT.

05:41.008 --> 05:42.376
- HOMO.

05:42.410 --> 05:45.446
- LOOK, SIT DOWN AND SHUT UP.
- HEY!

05:45.479 --> 05:47.448
- OR I'LL MAKE SURE YOUR BALLS
NEVER DROP.

05:47.481 --> 05:49.717
- YOU KNOW,
I DO EVERYTHING FOR HER.

05:49.750 --> 05:51.819
DO YOU THINK
SHE APPRECIATES IT?

05:51.852 --> 05:53.587
DO YOU THINK SHE EVER SAYS,
"THANK YOU"?

05:53.621 --> 05:55.623
ALL SHE DOES IS CRITICIZE.

05:55.656 --> 05:58.726
I MEAN, NOTHING
IS GOOD ENOUGH FOR HER.

05:58.759 --> 06:00.894
- WHY DON'T YOU KILL HER?

06:00.928 --> 06:02.129
NO JURY ON EARTH
WOULD CONVICT YOU.

06:02.162 --> 06:03.864
THEY ALL HAVE MOTHERS
OF THEIR OWN.

06:03.897 --> 06:05.132
- I HAVE A BETTER IDEA.

06:05.165 --> 06:06.834
YOU DEAL WITH HER.

06:06.867 --> 06:07.835
YOU PUT UP WITH HER DEMANDS,

06:07.868 --> 06:09.737
HER DRINKING,

06:09.770 --> 06:11.739
WHICH HAS GOTTEN
A LOT WORSE SINCE DADDY DIED.

06:11.772 --> 06:13.140
- SHE'S CELEBRATING.

06:13.173 --> 06:14.742
- WHY DON'T YOU DRIVE HER
TO THE DOCTOR,

06:14.775 --> 06:17.711
TO CHURCH,
TO GET HER HAIR DONE?

06:17.745 --> 06:19.112
- FUCK THAT SHIT.

06:19.146 --> 06:20.514
[boys snickering]

06:20.548 --> 06:22.416
- SHUT UP.

06:22.450 --> 06:23.717
SHE'S YOUR MOTHER TOO,

06:23.751 --> 06:25.519
AND YOU CAN'T
JUST STICK ME WITH HER.

06:25.553 --> 06:28.422
- IT'S WORKED SO FAR.
- WELL, NOT ANYMORE.

06:28.456 --> 06:29.757
I'VE LOOKED AFTER HER--

06:29.790 --> 06:31.625
WELL, AFTER BOTH OF THEM,
EVER SINCE WE WERE KIDS

06:31.659 --> 06:33.160
WHILE YOU JUST GOT
OFF SCOT-FREE.

06:33.193 --> 06:35.763
NOW EITHER YOU HELP ME OUT,
BRIAN,

06:35.796 --> 06:37.097
OR I SWEAR,

06:37.130 --> 06:38.466
SHE'S YOURS.

06:38.499 --> 06:39.833
ALL YOURS.

06:39.867 --> 06:42.035
[boys squabbling]

06:42.069 --> 06:43.871
COME ON, LET'S GO.
- AW. I DON'T WANNA GO.

06:43.904 --> 06:45.439
- I SAID WE'RE GOING.
LET'S GO.

06:45.473 --> 06:47.207
- AW.
- AW, THIS SUCKS.

[indistinct speech]

AFTER THIS, I GUESS I'VE DONE
THE VILLAGE PEOPLE.

- POOR BABY.

07:15.068 --> 07:17.805
YOU REALLY ARE EXHAUSTED.

07:19.039 --> 07:21.575
- INVOICES. PAYROLL.

07:21.609 --> 07:23.877
ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE.

07:23.911 --> 07:27.848
IT'S LIKE WERTSHAFTER'S
TIMES A THOUSAND.

07:27.881 --> 07:32.152
AND I'M SUPPOSED TO MEET THOR
THE IMPALER TONIGHT.

07:32.185 --> 07:34.054
OH, WHAT'S THE POINT?

07:34.087 --> 07:35.823
I'M TOO TIRED
TO EVEN GET IT UP.

07:35.856 --> 07:36.957
- HONEY,

07:36.990 --> 07:39.760
YOU ARE IN THE BIZ.

07:39.793 --> 07:41.929
A HARD DICK

07:41.962 --> 07:46.233
IS AT YOUR FINGERTIPS.

07:46.266 --> 07:48.035
- "VIAGRA"?

07:49.837 --> 07:50.938
I DON'T KNOW.

07:50.971 --> 07:52.573
I HAVEN'T EXACTLY HAD
A WINNING SCORE

07:52.606 --> 07:53.574
WHEN IT COMES TO DRUGS.

07:53.607 --> 07:55.108
- I UNDERSTAND YOUR TREPIDATION.

07:55.142 --> 07:56.910
AND NORMALLY
I'D AGREE WITH YOU,

07:56.944 --> 08:00.981
BUT, UH, BUT THIS STUFF
IS MADE FOR OCTOGENARIANS.

08:01.014 --> 08:03.150
IF THEY CAN FUCK LIKE
SOMEONE WHO'S 30,

08:03.183 --> 08:06.720
EVEN YOU SHOULD BE ABLE
TO FUCK LIKE SOMEONE WHO'S 80.

08:06.754 --> 08:07.921
- YOU EVER TRIED IT?

08:07.955 --> 08:10.791
- ONLY WHEN I OPERATE
HEAVY EQUIPMENT.

08:10.824 --> 08:12.292
- AND?

08:12.325 --> 08:14.728
- LASTS FOR A FEW HOURS, TOPS.

08:14.762 --> 08:16.664
BUT LONG ENOUGH
TO HAVE A NIGHT

08:16.697 --> 08:19.099
YOU'LL NEVER FORGET.

08:28.108 --> 08:30.644
- BEN.

08:30.678 --> 08:32.179
- HEY, MICHAEL.

08:32.212 --> 08:34.915
- WHAT A COINCIDENCE,
MY RUNNING INTO YOU.

08:34.948 --> 08:37.050
- UH, NOT REALLY.
I LIVE HERE.

08:40.854 --> 08:43.290
WELL, IT WAS NICE
SEEING YOU.

08:45.926 --> 08:48.629
- THE TRUTH IS, I'VE BEEN
WALKING UP AND DOWN THE BLOCK

08:48.662 --> 08:50.998
FOR TWO HOURS WAITING FOR YOU.

08:53.867 --> 08:55.936
- WOULD YOU LIKE TO COME UP?

08:55.969 --> 08:58.972
CAN I GET YOU SOMETHING
TO DRINK?

08:59.006 --> 09:01.642
- NO. THANKS.

09:01.675 --> 09:05.012
- OH, A FRIEND OF MINE
GAVE ME THAT.

09:05.045 --> 09:07.715
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO RUB
ITS BELLY FOR LUCK.

09:07.748 --> 09:09.717
- DOES IT WORK?

09:09.750 --> 09:12.252
- CAN'T HURT.

09:12.285 --> 09:15.222
- [quietly] COME THROUGH,
BUDDHA, OL' BUDDY.

09:22.362 --> 09:24.331
I'VE BEEN THINKING ABOUT YOU.

09:24.364 --> 09:27.000
A LOT.

09:27.034 --> 09:29.069
- I'VE THOUGHT ABOUT YOU TOO.

09:29.102 --> 09:31.939
- YEAH?

09:31.972 --> 09:34.107
I THINK
I MAY HAVE OVERREACTED.

09:34.141 --> 09:39.079
YOU KNOW,
TO YOU BEING POSITIVE.

09:39.112 --> 09:41.014
- HMM.

09:41.048 --> 09:42.716
- I LISTENED TO
A LOT OF PEOPLE

09:42.750 --> 09:45.118
WHEN I SHOULD HAVE LISTENED
TO MYSELF.

09:45.152 --> 09:48.221
ANYWAY...

09:48.255 --> 09:52.092
I'D LIKE TO START AGAIN.

09:52.125 --> 09:54.227
THAT IS,
IF YOU'RE NOT SEEING ANYONE.

09:54.261 --> 09:56.964
YOU'RE NOT SEEING ANYONE,
ARE YOU?

09:56.997 --> 09:59.366
- NO.

09:59.399 --> 10:02.135
- WELL, GOOD THEN...

10:02.169 --> 10:03.971
WE CAN PICK UP
WHERE WE LEFT OFF.

10:04.004 --> 10:06.940
- [chuckles]

10:06.974 --> 10:09.843
LOOK, UH, I APPRECIATE
YOUR COMING TO SEE ME

10:09.877 --> 10:11.111
AND EVERYTHING YOU SAID

10:11.144 --> 10:16.116
THAT THIS TIME
IT WOULD BE DIFFERENT.

10:16.149 --> 10:18.952
BUT I CAN'T TAKE THAT CHANCE.

10:18.986 --> 10:19.753
I NEED TO KNOW THAT

10:19.787 --> 10:21.822
IF I ALLOW MYSELF
TO LOVE SOMEONE,

10:21.855 --> 10:24.391
THAT THEY'RE NOT GONNA
BAIL ON ME.

10:24.424 --> 10:26.126
NO MATTER WHAT THEIR FRIENDS
OR THEIR MOTHER SAY,

10:26.159 --> 10:29.963
I NEED TO KNOW
THEY'LL BE THERE.

10:31.732 --> 10:33.667
SO I'M SORRY.

10:33.701 --> 10:38.038
BUT IT TAKES MORE
THAN A KISS.

10:38.071 --> 10:39.673
- OH.

10:39.707 --> 10:42.275
- IT'S BEEN AN HOUR
SINCE I TOOK IT.

10:42.309 --> 10:44.111
- WELL, THERE ARE
NO HARD OR FIRM RULES

10:44.144 --> 10:45.746
WHEN IT COMES
TO THESE THINGS.

10:45.779 --> 10:47.047
IT'LL HAPPEN WHEN IT HAPPENS.

10:47.080 --> 10:48.115
- WELL, I DON'T WANT
ANYTHING TO HAPPEN

10:48.148 --> 10:49.783
TILL THOR ARRIVES.
[phone beeps]

10:49.817 --> 10:51.351
HOLD ON.
[phone beeps]

10:51.384 --> 10:52.419
HELLO?

10:52.452 --> 10:54.454

10:54.487 --> 10:56.690
- HEY.

10:56.724 --> 10:58.826
SO, UH--
[dog yaps]

I-I WAS GOING TO LEAVE THIS
HERE BY THE DOOR WITH A NOTE,

21:56.082 --> 21:58.351
BUT THEN I THOUGHT
AS LONG AS I'M HERE...

21:58.385 --> 22:00.420
- I MIGHT AS WELL BANG

WITH YOUR DICK.

'CAUSE I SPEND TIME WITH HER.

33:15.061 --> 33:18.164
AND I TALK TO HER,
AND I TRY TO OFFER COMFORT.

33:18.197 --> 33:20.632
- BY TELLING HER THAT
I'M GOING TO BURN IN HELL?

33:20.666 --> 33:24.503
- I DON'T TEACH THAT LESSON.

33:24.536 --> 33:27.306
I TEACH LOVE.

33:27.339 --> 33:28.507
I TEACH TRUTH.

33:28.540 --> 33:30.609
- THE TRUTH
IS YOU'RE A GODDAMN LIAR.

33:30.642 --> 33:32.778
- BRIAN,
IF YOU WANT TO BETRAY ME,

33:32.811 --> 33:35.447
IF THAT'S
WHAT YOU NEED TO DO,

33:35.481 --> 33:39.085
YOU DO IT.

33:39.118 --> 33:41.553
BUT I KNOW
WHO I HAVE TO ANSWER TO.

33:41.587 --> 33:45.791
AND IT ISN'T YOU.

33:45.824 --> 33:49.628

34:04.443 --> 34:05.811
WHEN GUS AND I
AREN'T AROUND.

THE WORLD'S BEEN KILLING ITSELF
OVER IT EVER SINCE.

34:15.854 --> 34:18.557
YOUR MOTHER'S MINISTER?

34:19.891 --> 34:21.560
AND THE TRUTH SHALL
MAKE YOU FREE."

34:21.593 --> 34:24.230
- THE TRUTH ACCORDING
TO SAINT BRIAN?

34:24.263 --> 34:25.664
- IT'S JOHN 8:32.

34:25.697 --> 34:27.833
- WOW, I'M IMPRESSED.

34:27.866 --> 34:29.735
SO WHAT
DO YOU HOPE TO ACCOMPLISH

34:29.768 --> 34:32.771
WITH YOUR TRUTH?

YOU'LL DESTROY HIM, IN WHICH
CASE YOU'RE NO DIFFERENT

34:45.751 --> 34:49.855
SO HOW COME YOU NEVER
TOLD HER ABOUT YOURSELF?

34:49.888 --> 34:52.658
- BECAUSE MY PRIVATE LIFE IS
NONE OF HER GODDAMN BUSINESS.

34:52.691 --> 34:55.461
RIGHT?
- NEITHER IS HER MINISTER'S.

34:55.494 --> 34:57.863
SO WHY TELL HER?

34:57.896 --> 35:03.569
I MEAN, WHY TAKE AWAY
THE ONE THING SHE'S GOT?

35:03.602 --> 35:05.571
- [sighs]

35:06.638 --> 35:08.740
- DO YOU THINK I MADE ENOUGH?

35:08.774 --> 35:11.277

WHAT YOU MEAN BY "ENOUGH."

35:11.310 --> 35:13.445
IF YOU MEAN ENOUGH
FOR THE ENTIRE POPULATION

35:13.479 --> 35:14.480
OF THE WESTERN HEMISPHERE,

35:14.513 --> 35:17.683
THEN, YEAH,
YOU'VE MADE ENOUGH.

35:17.716 --> 35:19.885
NOW RELAX, WILL YOU?
- RELAX?

35:19.918 --> 35:22.221
MY SON IS BRINGING
SOMEONE HOME TO MEET US

35:22.254 --> 35:24.256

35:24.290 --> 35:26.625
HUH?
AT HIS REQUEST.

35:26.658 --> 35:28.594

THAT HAPPENED?

35:28.627 --> 35:30.529

TO GROW OLD WITH.

44:54.092 --> 44:55.794
SHE KNOWS LOTS
OF POSITIVE PEOPLE.

44:55.827 --> 44:56.928
- BUT NONE OF THEM
ARE DATING HER SON.

44:56.962 --> 44:58.296
SHE'S JUST TRYING
TO PROTECT YOU.

44:58.329 --> 45:00.732
- I DON'T NEED ANYONE
PROTECTING ME.

45:00.766 --> 45:03.068
- WELL, TRY TELLING HER THAT.

45:03.101 --> 45:06.471
WHAT SHE WAS ASKING,
YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO KNOW.

45:06.504 --> 45:08.206
I'M IN GOOD SHAPE NOW.

45:08.239 --> 45:09.440
BUT I CAN'T PROMISE
THAT I'LL ALWAYS BE.

45:09.474 --> 45:12.110
- BUT THERE IS NO ALWAYS.
THERE'S ONLY NOW.

45:12.143 --> 45:13.444
THAT'S ALL WE HAVE.

45:13.478 --> 45:15.781
ISN'T THAT WHAT YOU'RE ALWAYS
TELLING ME?

45:15.814 --> 45:17.115
- THAT'S WHAT
I'M ALWAYS TELLING YOU.

45:17.148 --> 45:20.318
- SO THEN I DON'T CARE

45:20.351 --> 45:23.488
WHAT ANYONE ELSE
SAYS OR FEELS.

45:23.521 --> 45:28.226
I JUST CARE HOW I FEEL.

47:30.048 --> 47:34.019
A CLERGYMAN BUYING
SOMEONE ELSE A DRINK.

47:34.052 --> 47:38.123

47:38.156 --> 47:42.493
