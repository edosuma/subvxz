WEBVTT

00:01.805 --> 00:03.930
Technical support. May I help you?

00:03.931 --> 00:07.877
Hi, uh, my Internet went out right in the
middle of watching Beethoven on Netflix.

00:07.878 --> 00:10.446
I need to know if that dog
gets put to sleep or not!

00:10.447 --> 00:13.015
Oh, the slobbery dog? It is most funny.

00:13.016 --> 00:15.017
My favorite is when he
steals the turkey leg

00:15.018 --> 00:16.619
- from Charles Grodin, and...
- No, no, no, no!

00:16.620 --> 00:18.931
Please don't ruin it!
Just fix my Internet.

00:18.932 --> 00:21.300
Of course, Sir. First,
power cycle the modem.

00:21.301 --> 00:23.790
Unplug the ethernet
cord and the AC adapter.

00:23.791 --> 00:25.699
Ether-dapter? What?

00:25.700 --> 00:28.164
I'm struggling with your stupid accent.

00:28.165 --> 00:29.697
What part of America are you from?

00:29.698 --> 00:32.433
My name is Mukund. I am
from Mumbai, India, Sir.

00:32.435 --> 00:35.583
Moon pie, India? Goddamn outsourcing!

00:35.584 --> 00:38.419
Stealing all our jobs,
screwing up our economy.

00:38.420 --> 00:41.256
My country is in the shitter
because of your country.

00:41.257 --> 00:45.827
This is a bunch of anti-American,
Uncle Sam-raping bullsh... oh.

00:45.828 --> 00:47.262
Oh, it's back on.

00:47.263 --> 00:52.003
Hey, uh, thanks, moonpie.
Thank you so much.

00:55.004 --> 00:58.004
<i>♪ Brickleberry! ♪</i>

01:02.278 --> 01:06.314
Good morning, rangers. Isn't
this a glorious morning?

01:06.315 --> 01:09.951
Guys, I'm trying to heat up my tea,
but there doesn't seem to be a door.

01:09.952 --> 01:12.287
It's never had a door.
Woody said doors cost extra.

01:12.288 --> 01:16.224
It still works. You just have to
shove a wet knife in the door hole.

01:16.225 --> 01:20.461
- Uh, isn't that dangerous?
- Oh, very.

01:20.462 --> 01:23.222
Another nosebleed.

01:25.101 --> 01:28.070
- Connie! What happened?
- Woody made me neuter the wolves,

01:28.071 --> 01:30.906
but he's too cheap to
buy tranquilizer darts.

01:30.907 --> 01:33.787
Okay, who's first?

01:33.943 --> 01:35.610
That's it, we've gotta do something.

01:35.611 --> 01:38.013
Yeah, before this bitch
turn into a werewolf.

01:38.014 --> 01:41.549
No, about Woody. He's totally
exploiting us just to cut the budget.

01:41.550 --> 01:44.121
We have no health insurance,
no pension, and this is

01:44.122 --> 01:46.722
the worst employee break
room I have ever seen.

01:46.723 --> 01:48.857
What incompetent moron is our Union Rep?

01:48.858 --> 01:49.858
Steve.

01:49.859 --> 01:55.463
Hey, I'm not incompetent, and
what's so bad about this break room?

01:55.464 --> 02:00.624
He broke my dick! That
fridge goat broke my dick!

02:01.704 --> 02:06.574
Yes. Is this bearlover dot net?
Well, your website is broken.

02:06.575 --> 02:08.408
I logged on to see cute bears,

02:08.410 --> 02:11.379
but I just keep seeing
pictures of fat, hairy gay guys!

02:11.380 --> 02:15.455
- Okay, and what is your name, Sir?
- Wait. Mukund? You work here, too?

02:15.456 --> 02:18.787
Yes, Sir. I work for four
companies, 22 hours a day.

02:18.788 --> 02:22.357
22 hours a day! What a work ethic.

02:22.358 --> 02:25.293
Well, your life probably sucks,
but at least you're loaded, right?

02:25.294 --> 02:27.281
I'm not loaded, but this gun is.

02:27.282 --> 02:30.822
I am coming to you, Ganesh!

02:31.167 --> 02:34.369
Man, this guy's hilarious.

02:34.370 --> 02:36.242
Hello? Hello?

02:36.243 --> 02:40.923
- You gonna get that? Ugh!
- Mukund? Mukund?

02:41.077 --> 02:44.146
Woody, somebody left a pile
of shit on the doorstep.

02:44.147 --> 02:45.480
Ha, ha, ha.

02:45.481 --> 02:47.715
Malloy, have you seen
Denzel, Ethel, and Connie?

02:47.716 --> 02:51.486
This is gonna sting, but they're having
a secret Union meeting to replace you.

02:51.487 --> 02:56.167
That didn't sting at
all. That felt great.

02:56.659 --> 03:00.028
Man, this place is scarier than the
backside of Connie's panties on taco night.

03:00.029 --> 03:03.529
Okay, what do we need? Proper health
benefits, safer working conditions...

03:03.530 --> 03:05.366
- A-ha!
- Ah, shit!

03:05.367 --> 03:06.768
Man, you scared me!

03:06.769 --> 03:09.771
So it's true! You guys
are trying to replace me

03:09.772 --> 03:11.460
- behind my back.
- The thing is, Steve,

03:11.461 --> 03:15.277
we need leadership, and the problem
is, Woody doesn't respect you.

03:15.278 --> 03:18.379
Woody doesn't respect me? But
you guys respect me, don't you?

03:18.380 --> 03:21.183
I think you're a pussy. Mmm.

03:21.184 --> 03:24.219
I'll stand up to Woody! Let
me go to him with your demands.

03:24.220 --> 03:27.622
All I ask is for one more
shot to win back your respect.

03:27.623 --> 03:29.324
Ooh, awkward.

03:29.325 --> 03:33.394
Uh, listen, we've got the graveyard
booked for a human sacrifice at midnight.

03:33.395 --> 03:37.665
Uh, you wouldn't happen
to be a virgin, would you?

03:37.666 --> 03:40.535
Okay, yeah, I get it. I think
you made your point, thank you.

03:40.536 --> 03:44.339
And thank you for double-checking
with me. That's so sweet.

03:44.340 --> 03:46.734
What the hell do you want, Steve?

03:46.735 --> 03:50.712
Woody, as you know, I'm the
representative for the rangers here,

03:50.713 --> 03:53.017
and we have some demands we'd like met.

03:53.018 --> 03:55.731
- Demands?
- Well, maybe suggestions.

03:55.732 --> 03:57.685
Suggestions?

03:57.686 --> 03:59.931
Well, more of a wish list, actually.

03:59.932 --> 04:01.622
All right, Steve.

04:01.623 --> 04:03.391
You want to negotiate?

04:03.392 --> 04:06.092
We'll negotiate.

04:08.564 --> 04:09.965
Good news, guys.

04:09.966 --> 04:12.334
We don't have that crappy
health insurance anymore.

04:12.335 --> 04:14.369
Really? What insurance do we have now?

04:14.370 --> 04:16.762
None, but this way
we'll be more careful.

04:16.762 --> 04:17.973
All:

04:17.974 --> 04:19.507
Also, you know what I really hate?

04:19.507 --> 04:23.198
When you're in your groove,
rangering it up, and then boom,

04:23.199 --> 04:25.713
you get interrupted by
having to take a lunch break.

04:25.714 --> 04:27.715
So Woody's gonna get rid of those.

04:27.716 --> 04:30.712
Steve, you're a spineless turd.
You can't stand up to anyone.

04:30.713 --> 04:31.648
Yes, I can.

04:31.649 --> 04:33.408
- Sit your ass down!
- Okay.

04:33.409 --> 04:36.491
This is unacceptable, and we are
not going to put up with this.

04:36.492 --> 04:39.386
Oh, no? Then maybe I
should just replace you.

04:39.387 --> 04:42.397
Right, like you could find anyone
who would work for less than us.

04:42.398 --> 04:46.958
Funny you should say
that. I already did.

04:48.337 --> 04:49.737
- Hello, my friends.
- Hello, my friends.

04:49.738 --> 04:50.971
Thousand greetings.

04:50.972 --> 04:55.944
Ha, ha, ha! They're Skyped in from
India, and work for three bucks a day.

04:55.945 --> 04:58.746
Do they get any channels
other than Al Jazeera?

04:58.747 --> 05:00.015
So what's it gonna be?

05:00.016 --> 05:04.993
You can "A" take the deal Steve and
I agreed to, or "B" get the hell out!

05:04.994 --> 05:09.224
This is ridiculous. He can't possibly
outsource park rangers to India.

05:09.225 --> 05:11.326
- I call his bluff.
- I'm with Ethel.

05:11.327 --> 05:16.967
Hell, yeah! I'm with Ethel
and Andre the 'Gina. I quit.

05:17.766 --> 05:20.701
Steve, I am so proud of
you for quitting with us.

05:20.702 --> 05:22.870
Yeah, that took balls, Steve.

05:22.871 --> 05:25.140
Well, all for one, right?

05:25.141 --> 05:26.874
Yeah. I thought you was gonna punk out.

05:26.875 --> 05:29.311
Hey, why don't you have
anything in your box?

05:29.312 --> 05:32.447
Sorry, guys, I couldn't quit.
Could you recycle this for me?

05:32.448 --> 05:34.615
- Traitor!
- I should've known.

05:34.616 --> 05:37.329
You better be glad this flimsy
gate's here, or I'd whoop your ass.

05:37.330 --> 05:38.686
I'm with Woody, guys.

05:38.687 --> 05:42.157
I couldn't leave Brickleberry even
if I had to take a 50% pay cut!

05:42.158 --> 05:45.293
Sounds good, Steve! I'm
giving you a 50% pay cut!

05:45.294 --> 05:47.495
Thank you. Great idea, Sir.

05:47.496 --> 05:48.684
Damn it.

05:48.685 --> 05:53.725
Welcome to Brickleberry
National Park, my friends.

05:59.300 --> 06:01.925
Ow! What? I swear to
God, he asked to see it.

06:01.926 --> 06:03.143
Ow!

06:03.144 --> 06:06.579
Ooh, look at that! These
dot bots are incredible!

06:06.580 --> 06:10.951
They work hard and don't complain,
unlike those quitters you call friends.

06:10.952 --> 06:13.086
Gotta respect those
stupid assholes, though.

06:13.087 --> 06:14.320
They stuck to their guns.

06:14.321 --> 06:16.423
How 'bout me? I did
exactly what you wanted.

06:16.424 --> 06:17.991
Damn right, you did.

06:17.992 --> 06:19.760
Hey, Dottie! Two lemonades.

06:19.761 --> 06:22.529
One for me and one for my
submissive bitch, Steve.

06:22.530 --> 06:24.397
Woody, this is not gonna work out.

06:24.398 --> 06:26.557
I mean, they're robots.

06:26.558 --> 06:31.058
Here are the two
lemonades you requested.

06:34.200 --> 06:38.940
Or maybe I shouldn't
be so quick to judge.

06:39.401 --> 06:42.459
The panda's mating season
is from July to September.

06:42.460 --> 06:45.167
Yeah, eat that bamboo.

06:45.168 --> 06:46.987
Hey, keep it down.
I'm trying to watch TV.

06:46.988 --> 06:48.889
Look, Ajay, a talking bear!

06:48.890 --> 06:53.259
He is much like the Teddy Ruxpin,
a children's toy from the mid-1980s.

06:53.260 --> 06:55.896
You would simply insert
audio cassettes into his anus

06:55.897 --> 06:57.164
and he would read fables to you.

06:57.165 --> 06:59.966
Listen, you're not gonna ruin my
life with your annoying work ethic.

06:59.967 --> 07:01.935
Now loosen up, have some fun.

07:01.936 --> 07:04.637
Let's watch some Asian porn
together like gentlemen.

07:04.638 --> 07:09.858
Pandas don't do it for
us. Do you have any cows?

07:10.377 --> 07:12.746
I can't believe Steve did this to us.

07:12.747 --> 07:14.948
It's okay, Connie. We'll
just find new jobs here.

07:14.949 --> 07:16.316
In this inbred, hick town?

07:16.317 --> 07:19.186
I take offense to that. I is the Mayor.

07:19.187 --> 07:20.754
Now I is the Mayor.

07:20.755 --> 07:24.347
You better gimme back
my goddamn Mayor hat!

07:24.348 --> 07:25.926
Politics.

07:25.927 --> 07:28.895
What's more offensive to you?
9/11 jokes or 7-Eleven jokes?

07:28.896 --> 07:29.896
Mm?

07:29.897 --> 07:31.397
Hey, Steve, check this out.

07:31.398 --> 07:33.333
I think I've seen your
mother. She's bow-legged

07:33.334 --> 07:36.069
from your fat head
coming through her wagina.

07:36.070 --> 07:40.408
Nice. If either one of us
had hands, I'd high-five you.

07:40.409 --> 07:44.111
Mr. Steve, I can't believe
they disrespect you like that.

07:44.112 --> 07:46.378
Ah, it's okay. They're my buddies.

07:46.379 --> 07:49.149
- I'm not your buddy, dick hole!
- Eh, me neither, dick hole!

07:49.150 --> 07:50.851
Uh, you're Dottie, right?

07:50.852 --> 07:54.632
Actually, my name is Rakshapani.

07:55.256 --> 07:56.556
Oh, uh, I'm Steve.

07:56.557 --> 08:00.660
I know. You are the top
ranger here at Brickleberry.

08:00.661 --> 08:02.929
Really? You know what?

08:02.930 --> 08:08.330
We should grab dinner some
time, rock... shit... pony.

08:09.370 --> 08:11.437
We've looked everywhere.

08:11.438 --> 08:13.874
There's no job openings in this town.

08:13.875 --> 08:18.478
- This place looks promising.
- Ethel, I think that's a titty bar.

08:18.479 --> 08:20.480
- I don't know if we should...
- Yeah!

08:20.481 --> 08:23.841
Tit-ty bar! Tit-ty bar!

08:33.494 --> 08:36.313
Come in, come in!

08:36.764 --> 08:39.099
Jesus, this business
is getting so stale.

08:39.100 --> 08:40.332
What do you want?

08:40.333 --> 08:42.197
What do we have here?

08:42.198 --> 08:45.438
You! You're the world's
next stripping sensation!

08:45.439 --> 08:48.834
Well, guys, this is a...
this is a tough decision,

08:48.835 --> 08:52.779
but I'm going to do it. I'm
gonna do it for all of us.

08:52.780 --> 08:56.881
Okay, Sir, I will agree to
expose my perfect body for money.

08:56.882 --> 08:59.920
Not you, skinny tits. There's
a million just like you.

08:59.921 --> 09:02.255
I'm talking about her!

09:02.256 --> 09:03.623
- Me?
- Her?

09:03.624 --> 09:05.504
- You blind, right?
- Shut your face!

09:05.505 --> 09:08.206
My whole career I've
been looking for an act

09:08.207 --> 09:11.832
so unconventional that it
will shake up the industry.

09:11.833 --> 09:15.758
I've got big plans. I'm
going to make you a star!

09:15.759 --> 09:17.516
Mm, I don't know, Mister.

09:17.517 --> 09:21.160
It's Jorge. Come on! I'll
even hire these two freaks.

09:21.161 --> 09:23.443
- Okay, I'll do it.
- Yes!

09:23.444 --> 09:26.847
You'll be our new DJ, and you
can mop up the peep booths.

09:26.848 --> 09:28.849
- What?
- Man. I hate DJ-ing.

09:28.850 --> 09:30.365
- You want to switch jobs?
- Really?

09:30.366 --> 09:35.255
Hell, no! I love DJ-ing. Have
fun mopping up that semen.

09:35.256 --> 09:38.158
Aw, you guys are working again.

09:38.159 --> 09:44.059
Come on, put him down. I've got
a really important job for you.

09:48.469 --> 09:51.338
Now, if one of you
could rape the other one,

09:51.339 --> 09:54.407
this would be just like game of thrones.

09:54.408 --> 09:58.778
And that is why Jesus could beat
Gandhi in mixed martial arts.

09:58.779 --> 10:02.215
Oh, Steve, you know so
much about everything.

10:02.216 --> 10:05.395
I hope to one day become
a great ranger like you.

10:05.396 --> 10:10.423
True, I am a great ranger, but I'm...
I, uh, let my friends down recently.

10:10.424 --> 10:12.525
I'm sure you did everything you could.

10:12.526 --> 10:14.176
You're a good man, Steve.

10:14.177 --> 10:19.277
Oh, rock shit pony. I
love how you just get me.

10:49.554 --> 10:54.591
Usually I hate foreigners, I'm gonna
be honest, but you guys I hate way less.

10:54.592 --> 10:58.796
This has been very much fun.
Unfortunately, we must get back to work.

10:58.797 --> 11:00.871
Back to work at this hour? Come on!

11:00.872 --> 11:04.449
Mr. Woody has advised me we do
not get time off to sleep even.

11:04.450 --> 11:06.770
- Well, don't listen to him.
- How do you don't listen?

11:06.771 --> 11:09.073
See, here in America, the only person

11:09.074 --> 11:11.909
you should take orders from
are your friends, like me.

11:11.910 --> 11:15.069
When your boss tells you to do
something, it's just a suggestion.

11:15.070 --> 11:18.749
The goal should be to do as
little work as humanly possible.

11:18.750 --> 11:23.452
Really? What else should
we know about America?

11:23.453 --> 11:27.303
I cannot believe we are at
a real American strip party.

11:27.304 --> 11:30.794
I know. I will now produce precipitation

11:30.795 --> 11:34.732
using this low-denominational currency.

11:34.733 --> 11:38.602
So, mahogany man. Are you
ready to introduce the girls?

11:38.603 --> 11:41.605
Yeah. I took it upon myself
to do a little research.

11:41.606 --> 11:43.974
Hey, y'all, it's your boy, Dirty D,

11:43.975 --> 11:46.676
the only DJ that tells
it like it really is.

11:46.677 --> 11:49.179
Up next to the stage is a hot young lady

11:49.180 --> 11:51.849
who was sexually abused by
her special needs brother.

11:51.850 --> 11:54.684
She blamed herself and
picked up a nasty meth habit.

11:54.685 --> 11:56.920
Please, show her some
love and maybe she won't

11:56.921 --> 12:02.821
cry herself to sleep tonight.
Welcome Kandy to the main stage!

12:04.462 --> 12:07.264
There you are! Woody is pissed.

12:07.265 --> 12:08.498
You guys should be at work!

12:08.499 --> 12:10.801
Hey, lard face, we are in America now.

12:10.802 --> 12:13.170
This is how the game is played.

12:13.171 --> 12:16.406
Yes, it's time to be
lazy, wear the Levi,

12:16.407 --> 12:19.843
eat the french fry, and see the titty.

12:19.844 --> 12:21.644
Oh.

12:21.712 --> 12:23.981
Hey, Ethel. What are you doing here?

12:23.982 --> 12:27.918
My new job, the official mayonnaise
mopper thanks to you, Steve.

12:27.919 --> 12:30.220
This'll look great on my resume.

12:30.221 --> 12:31.822
It's not that bad of a gig.

12:31.823 --> 12:34.258
Hey. Ethel! I need you
in the champagne room!

12:34.259 --> 12:36.994
It looks like a pinkberry
exploded in there!

12:36.995 --> 12:38.862
Up next is Crystal.

12:38.863 --> 12:41.098
She'll be shakin' that
ass to buy baby formula.

12:41.099 --> 12:46.036
She's on probation for stealin' Huggies
and she lives in a 1980 Monte Carlo!

12:46.037 --> 12:50.107
The only thing lower than her
hourly rates is her self-esteem.

12:50.108 --> 12:54.248
So let's get rock hard for Crystal!

13:03.354 --> 13:05.655
All right, Ajay. I got
50 on Mohindernanthan.

13:05.656 --> 13:09.226
What in the hell is going on?
You're not even allowed in here!

13:09.227 --> 13:10.840
We do the ping pong with the bear.

13:10.841 --> 13:13.263
I thought I told you to drag
that trash into the lake!

13:13.264 --> 13:14.954
We did not feel like it.

13:14.955 --> 13:17.267
Didn't f... you robots are dead meat!

13:17.268 --> 13:20.070
I am doubling your work! The
work that you are doing now,

13:20.071 --> 13:22.973
your going to be doing twice
as much of it! Doubling!

13:22.974 --> 13:26.694
You ever heard of that, ra...?

13:33.318 --> 13:35.178
Mmm.

13:35.786 --> 13:37.620
Mmm.

13:37.621 --> 13:39.589
Whoa! What the hell
are you doing, Steve?

13:39.590 --> 13:41.024
This is even weird for you.

13:41.025 --> 13:42.259
Woody, I, uh...

13:42.260 --> 13:45.628
Steve you cannot have
sex with the robots!

13:45.629 --> 13:48.631
She needs to be working. I don't
want you to see her anymore.

13:48.632 --> 13:52.069
- But, Sir...
- I'll handle this, Dottie.

13:52.070 --> 13:54.146
Whatever you say, Woody.
I won't see her anymore.

13:54.147 --> 13:56.438
What? What are you doing, Steve?

13:56.439 --> 13:59.569
Sorry, Dottie. You heard what he said.

13:59.570 --> 14:02.812
In love with a robot. Steve,
you stupid son of a bitch.

14:02.813 --> 14:05.588
No wonder your friends
don't respect you.

14:05.589 --> 14:09.429
You don't even respect yourself.

14:16.226 --> 14:19.526
Dottie. Look, I'm sorry.

14:20.226 --> 14:23.230
What! Who are you?
Where's rock shit pony?

14:23.231 --> 14:24.711
Oh, Rakshapani's dead.

14:24.712 --> 14:26.566
- What?
- No, no, no, no, no.

14:26.567 --> 14:29.369
Rakshapani was raped by a wizard.

14:29.370 --> 14:32.199
- What?
- I mean she quit.

14:32.200 --> 14:34.180
Sorry.

14:35.076 --> 14:37.744
All right, Denzel. Connie's next.

14:37.745 --> 14:40.313
Give our star a proper intro!

14:40.314 --> 14:42.182
Next up, guys, we have something

14:42.183 --> 14:45.986
I'm sure you've never seen
before and never wanted to.

14:45.987 --> 14:49.222
A plus-size lesbian, with abnormal
enlargement of the clitoris.

14:49.223 --> 14:50.556
Give me that!

14:50.557 --> 14:54.838
Are you ready for the most unique
new talent you've ever seen, guys?

14:54.839 --> 14:59.966
Please welcome the world's
newest stripping legend, Con-nie!

14:59.967 --> 15:02.127
Go! Yes!

15:06.640 --> 15:09.820
What the hell is that?

15:32.499 --> 15:36.471
Yes, they love you!
Show them the 7-10 split!

15:36.472 --> 15:38.272
Oh!

15:43.152 --> 15:47.352
Connie! Connie! Connie! Connie! Connie!

15:47.828 --> 15:52.028
Connie! Connie! Connie! Connie! Connie!

16:06.335 --> 16:09.635
Hey, hey! Wait a minute!

16:10.907 --> 16:13.408
Skinny tits, where the
hell shit is Connie?

16:13.409 --> 16:16.589
She's missing practice.

16:17.513 --> 16:20.115
- Uh, where do you think you're going?
- I need to see Connie.

16:20.116 --> 16:21.516
You got an appointment?

16:21.517 --> 16:23.551
Hey, you don't have an appointment.

16:23.552 --> 16:26.380
Here's the peeled grapes you asked for.

16:26.381 --> 16:27.521
Feed me.

16:27.522 --> 16:30.478
All right, don't you think you're
taking this diva stuff a little too far?

16:30.479 --> 16:31.939
It's not like you.

16:31.940 --> 16:33.743
Jorge said you blew off practice again?

16:33.744 --> 16:36.813
I don't have time for
that. I'm a Goddess,

16:36.814 --> 16:40.584
not a plain girl like you.
I deserve star treatment.

16:40.585 --> 16:42.519
- I can't believe...
- Feed me!

16:42.520 --> 16:45.922
We want Connie! We want Connie!

16:45.923 --> 16:49.259
Connie, what are you doing? It's
time to go on. Your fans await.

16:49.260 --> 16:51.027
Even the Mayor is here
with his Mayor hat.

16:51.028 --> 16:53.345
I'll go on when I feel like it!

16:53.346 --> 16:56.500
What happen to you? You get
too big for your britches!

16:56.501 --> 17:00.304
You don't practice, your cooch-hoop
has become loose and undisciplined.

17:00.305 --> 17:02.939
You get down on your knees and beg me.

17:02.940 --> 17:05.376
Fak ju! I don't beg for anybody!

17:05.377 --> 17:07.444
Okay, I beg. Come on, Connie, please.

17:07.444 --> 17:10.565
Please, Connie, please.

17:11.249 --> 17:13.949
Hit me! Hit me!

17:30.003 --> 17:33.483
Hey! That was just a joke.

17:33.623 --> 17:36.503
Let her try again.

17:38.709 --> 17:41.412
Yeah, so if I stretch real far...

17:41.413 --> 17:46.016
If I stretch as far as I can, I can
just touch the helmet with my tongue.

17:46.017 --> 17:48.318
Uh, Steve. I'm actually
happy to see you.

17:48.319 --> 17:50.587
Hey, Woody, can I talk to you for...

17:50.588 --> 17:52.856
Yeah, thanks to outsourcing, Steve,

17:52.857 --> 17:55.125
Brickleberry's budget
is back in the black.

17:55.126 --> 17:57.227
Check it out. Look at
all the money we saved.

17:57.228 --> 18:00.230
- How much did that bulletin board cost?
- All the money we saved.

18:00.231 --> 18:02.433
Look, Woody, I need some time off.

18:02.434 --> 18:05.169
I'm flying to India to get
back the love of my life.

18:05.170 --> 18:08.672
Hold on. Uh, Woody was just telling
me how he tried to suck himself,

18:08.673 --> 18:11.053
and somehow you still win most pathetic.

18:11.054 --> 18:14.278
They will be no time off,
and that's final! Get to work!

18:14.279 --> 18:16.739
I understand.

18:18.937 --> 18:20.005
No.

18:20.006 --> 18:21.866
Ooh.

18:22.601 --> 18:24.602
What did you say, Steve?

18:24.603 --> 18:27.571
I said no. Not this time.

18:27.572 --> 18:30.955
You're not gonna push me
around. I'm not backing down!

18:30.956 --> 18:32.690
- What?
- Yeah.

18:32.691 --> 18:35.593
I'm going to India to
get rock shit pony back.

18:35.594 --> 18:39.163
I love her and that's what I'm going
to do, whether you like it or not.

18:39.164 --> 18:41.031
Well then, Steve, you're...

18:41.032 --> 18:44.402
Fired? Good. You treat me like garbage.

18:44.403 --> 18:47.738
You can run this place on your own.
I should've left when the others did.

18:47.739 --> 18:52.719
Now, if you'll excuse
me, I'm going to India!

18:58.717 --> 19:00.585
Rock shit pony?

19:00.586 --> 19:02.566
Steve?

19:08.486 --> 19:12.722
I'm sorry, guys. I guess
I should've practiced more.

19:12.723 --> 19:15.492
I got lazy and let it all go to my head.

19:15.493 --> 19:17.931
Ha, looks like you let some
of it go to your ass, too!

19:17.932 --> 19:19.093
It's okay, Connie.

19:19.094 --> 19:22.034
You. You ruined me!

19:22.204 --> 19:24.905
That vagina could have been
bigger than the Beatles!

19:24.906 --> 19:27.875
Too bad it's attached to an egomaniac!

19:27.876 --> 19:30.245
Get out! You're fired!

19:30.246 --> 19:33.714
Take the brown one and the
walking stick with tits with you!

19:33.715 --> 19:37.195
Well, a compliment, finally!

19:43.091 --> 19:45.026
Hey! What the hell are you doing?

19:45.027 --> 19:47.927
We are just stealing from work.
That is what Americans do, yes?

19:47.928 --> 19:51.098
Yes Mohindernanthan. We are entitled.

19:51.099 --> 19:55.470
My bulletin board! That
is it! You're all fired!

19:55.471 --> 19:59.469
I'm calling your company right now.

19:59.470 --> 20:01.874
Outsourcing of India,
how may I help you?

20:01.875 --> 20:05.527
What? I can't understand you!
Let me speak to an Indian!

20:05.528 --> 20:08.364
Ah. So sorry, but entire
customer service department

20:08.365 --> 20:10.973
has been outsourced to south Korea.

20:10.974 --> 20:13.674
Ugh! Goddamn it!

20:16.606 --> 20:18.474
All right, I stand corrected.

20:18.475 --> 20:21.510
Those turban-ators were
even worse than you.

20:21.511 --> 20:24.513
Steve convinced me to give
you your old jobs back.

20:24.514 --> 20:28.050
At full pay, with better health
benefits, and safer working conditions.

20:28.051 --> 20:29.614
And I get a three hour work day.

20:29.615 --> 20:30.903
- Fine!
- Week.

20:30.904 --> 20:31.887
- Fine!
- Month.

20:31.888 --> 20:35.057
- Whatever! Just get back to work.
- Ugh! You hired them back?

20:35.058 --> 20:36.625
What happened to my robots?

20:36.626 --> 20:42.146
Don't worry about them. Some
stupid ass will hire 'em.

20:44.300 --> 20:46.921
I (Bleep) Love...

20:46.922 --> 20:49.022
America!
