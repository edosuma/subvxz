00:15.148 --> 00:17.316

Cheesy dashboard hula dolls

00:42.909 --> 00:44.643
- Eh, what's up, doc?

00:44.645 --> 00:47.980
- Yard sale. I need money to
buy tina's birthday present,

00:47.982 --> 00:51.583
You know, something special
like a string of pearls or

00:51.585 --> 00:53.085
A mariachi uniform.

00:53.087 --> 00:56.655
Maybe. Those uniforms
are like wearable gold.

00:56.657 --> 00:58.090
- So you're selling my stuff?

00:58.092 --> 01:00.626
- You know that everything I
own comes from the generosity

01:00.628 --> 01:05.129
Of friends, which I then
break and turn into garbage.

01:05.132 --> 01:06.999
Hello, shiny.

01:07.001 --> 01:09.701
What are you worth?

01:09.703 --> 01:10.636
- Why, nothing.

01:10.638 --> 01:12.805
It's a worthless trinket.

01:14.941 --> 01:16.742
[sniffing]

01:16.744 --> 01:21.146
You're lying, and you're
using a new soap that

01:21.148 --> 01:22.114
Smells like sunshine.

01:22.116 --> 01:25.751
- Oh, thanks. It's a body wash,
but you're right,

01:25.753 --> 01:27.986
And it's time you
knew the truth.

01:27.988 --> 01:30.622
- I knew it was time
I knew the truth.

01:30.624 --> 01:33.592
- I'm not the bunny
you think I am.

01:33.594 --> 01:36.228
My name isn't really bugs.

01:36.230 --> 01:37.362
It's kal-el.

01:37.364 --> 01:40.999
I was born long ago on
the planet krypton.

01:41.001 --> 01:43.302
- Hold on a sec! Krypton?

01:43.304 --> 01:44.837
Oh, no, you don't.

01:44.839 --> 01:46.438
That's superman's home planet.

01:46.440 --> 01:49.775
I fell for that once, but
I'm way too smart to fall

01:49.777 --> 01:50.642
For it again.

01:50.644 --> 01:53.679
- I meant crypton
with a "c," not a "k."

01:53.681 --> 01:56.381
- Oh, crypton with a "c."

01:56.383 --> 01:58.550
Ok. I buy it. Continue.

01:58.552 --> 02:02.221
- It was a simpler,
more dangerous time.

02:03.857 --> 02:06.291
I lived in the city of
metropolis, the very

02:06.293 --> 02:11.430
Definition of a city
and a primary target for every

02:11.432 --> 02:15.467
Supervillain with
an evil scheme.

02:50.036 --> 02:53.205
Luckily, I was
the greatest superhero

02:53.207 --> 02:54.873
Earth had ever known.

02:54.875 --> 02:58.210
I was superrabbit.

03:01.447 --> 03:06.685
Say, "ahh," you
mechanical maroon!

03:06.687 --> 03:08.320
Huh?

03:10.190 --> 03:11.089
- Ha ha ha!

03:11.091 --> 03:15.627
Poor, deluded superrabbit,
your might is no match

03:15.629 --> 03:17.563
For my mind.

03:17.565 --> 03:21.633
I'm turning metropolis
into tiny miniopolis,

03:21.635 --> 03:25.003
And you will be
its star attraction,

03:25.005 --> 03:28.173
That is as soon as I find you.

03:32.779 --> 03:34.146
Unh!

03:34.148 --> 03:36.315
Whoa!

03:36.317 --> 03:37.049
Errff!

03:37.051 --> 03:41.286
- Eh, maybe you should change
your name to lame brainiac.

03:41.288 --> 03:46.892
- You're making me very
angry, very angry indeed.

03:46.894 --> 03:51.063
- Don't forget.
I'm not just superstrong.

03:51.065 --> 03:54.766
I'm also superagile...

03:54.768 --> 03:57.502
And superphotogenic.

03:58.471 --> 04:01.273
- Ohh! Ugh!

04:04.978 --> 04:09.147
Oh, goodie! I got him,
I got him, I got him!

04:09.149 --> 04:12.751
Eh...Got who, genius?

04:12.753 --> 04:14.686
Mm-whah!

04:14.688 --> 04:17.889
- Ohh! Oh, ooh, ohh!

04:17.891 --> 04:19.925
Yuck! Ptt! Ptt! Ugh!

04:19.927 --> 04:22.261
- What is it with you and
this shrinking stuff anyway?

04:22.263 --> 04:26.898
- I'd explain, but I highly
doubt a pea brain like yours

04:26.900 --> 04:28.100
Would understand.

04:28.102 --> 04:30.269
- Oh, it's a brain size thing.

04:30.271 --> 04:32.371
Let's see.

04:36.943 --> 04:38.910
- [high-pitched voice]
I will make you suffer

04:38.912 --> 04:40.379
For all eternity.

04:40.381 --> 04:42.014
- Hee hee hee! Sorry.

04:42.016 --> 04:46.218
I can't take you
seriously with that voice.

04:48.187 --> 04:50.255
- [deep voice]
you pushed the wrong button.

04:50.257 --> 04:52.057
Give me the cannon.
Let me do it.

04:52.059 --> 04:55.060
- Yeah, right. The "s" on
my chest doesn't stand

04:55.062 --> 04:57.195
For "simpleton."

05:09.609 --> 05:13.378
Oh, look.
I'm a regular pablo picasso.

05:13.380 --> 05:15.814
- [groans]

05:15.816 --> 05:18.483
- I loved everything about
being a hero--the powers,

05:18.718 --> 05:22.487
The action, the attention,
the costume, but I loved

05:22.489 --> 05:28.927
The people most of all,
and the people loved me back.

05:28.929 --> 05:31.430
- [people shouting]

05:34.967 --> 05:39.504
- Sorry I cwashed your
wittle party, superwabbit.

05:45.878 --> 05:50.048
- Lex luthor, it's
never a pleasure.

05:50.050 --> 05:52.084
Try to keep up.

05:57.724 --> 05:59.224
- Ohh!

05:59.226 --> 06:02.894
- Shh. Be very, very quiet.

06:02.896 --> 06:05.030
I'm hunting superwabbit.

06:05.032 --> 06:07.032
Ah ah ah!

06:07.867 --> 06:12.504
Oh, mr. Superwabbit, come out,
come out wherever you are.

06:12.506 --> 06:14.039
- ¶ yoo-hoo ¶

06:14.041 --> 06:15.741
- Huh?

06:21.781 --> 06:24.549
[car alarms blaring]

06:34.293 --> 06:35.594
- [yawns]

06:35.596 --> 06:37.963
Are you almost finished?

06:37.965 --> 06:41.666
- Ooh! Scwewy wabbit!

06:45.705 --> 06:47.906
Whoa!

06:48.474 --> 06:51.076
Oof!

06:51.078 --> 06:53.478
[groans]

07:00.353 --> 07:03.688
- Ooh! I wonder if I could
hit that cloud shaped

07:03.690 --> 07:05.624
Like a fishy.

07:10.296 --> 07:11.797
Home run!

07:11.799 --> 07:14.399
Superrabbit wins!

07:14.401 --> 07:16.234
- [cheering]

07:16.236 --> 07:17.636
- Congwatulations, show boat.

07:17.638 --> 07:22.908
You just waunched an unstable
nucwear acclewator into space.

07:22.910 --> 07:25.944
- And that was my big mistake.

07:25.946 --> 07:27.913
- Why? Was the
war suit a rental?

07:27.915 --> 07:29.915
- No. The phantom zone
was orbiting earth,

07:30.049 --> 07:34.186
And general zod was waiting
for a chance to escape,

07:34.188 --> 07:35.620
And I gave it to him.

07:35.622 --> 07:39.124
- Oh, no! Not him!
Not general zod!

07:39.126 --> 07:40.091
Who's general zod?

07:40.093 --> 07:43.195
- This might be a good
time for a strategically

07:43.197 --> 07:45.530
Placed flashback.

07:45.532 --> 07:49.201
Many years ago back on
crypton, my father put

07:49.203 --> 07:52.337
General zod
and his minions on trial.

07:52.339 --> 07:57.876
- Counselors of crypton,
3 criminals stand before us

07:57.878 --> 08:03.215
For judgment--thunkian,
a relentless fighting machine

08:03.217 --> 08:07.819
With the intellect
and personality of a lost sock;

08:07.821 --> 08:12.691
Faora a bitter she-bully,
punishing the universe for her

08:12.693 --> 08:17.696
Dysfunctional romance with
insensitive boyfriend

08:17.698 --> 08:18.530
General zod;

08:18.532 --> 08:24.002
And general zod himself,
the would-be tyrant, blindly

08:24.004 --> 08:27.305
Obsessed with making
others submit.

08:27.307 --> 08:32.143
As the evidence will show,
these 3 have repeatedly--

08:32.145 --> 08:34.513
- Guilty.
- Guilty.
- Guilty!

08:34.515 --> 08:38.850
- Oh, come on! You guys do
that every time, every time!

08:38.985 --> 08:42.554
- As you know, jor-el,
the verdict must be unanimous.

08:42.556 --> 08:46.491
You alone will condemn us,
and you alone will suffer

08:46.493 --> 08:48.159
My wrath if you do.

08:48.161 --> 08:53.164
- General zod, I banish
you and your cohorts

08:53.166 --> 08:56.768
Now and forever.

09:00.840 --> 09:04.910
- You will kneel before me,
jor-el, you and anyone who

09:04.912 --> 09:07.445
Wears that silly "s"
on their chest.

09:07.447 --> 09:09.447
- That's it? A threat?

09:09.649 --> 09:13.618
- Not a threat,
my darling, a vow.

09:13.620 --> 09:16.888
- Great. Problem solved then.

09:19.125 --> 09:22.594
- Aah!
- Aah!

09:22.596 --> 09:28.166
Jor-elllll!

09:28.168 --> 09:30.602
- So you understand
who general zod is now?

09:30.604 --> 09:35.240
- Yep. He's a smart, handsome,
charming, rich go-getter.

09:35.242 --> 09:36.207
- No.

09:36.209 --> 09:37.275
- Agree to disagree.

09:37.277 --> 09:41.012
- Anyway, back to the story.

09:42.982 --> 09:44.649
- Main reactor breached.

09:44.651 --> 09:46.718
Thermal detonation imminent.

09:46.720 --> 09:49.054
Detonation in 10 seconds.

09:49.056 --> 09:53.358
10, 9, 8, 7, 6...

09:53.360 --> 09:54.526
- General, look!

09:54.528 --> 09:56.394
- Yes, my darling, I see it,

09:56.396 --> 09:57.529
Heading straight for us

09:57.531 --> 09:59.364
And counting down as
if it were going to...

09:59.366 --> 10:02.400
- Explode!

10:02.402 --> 10:04.269
- Aah!

10:08.274 --> 10:12.811
The yellow sun gives
cryptonians great power, power

10:12.813 --> 10:17.482
That we will use to wreak
vengeance on kal-el,

10:17.484 --> 10:19.684
Or superrabbit,
as he is known on earth.

10:19.686 --> 10:21.753
- Doesn't he have
the same power?

10:21.755 --> 10:23.788
- Yes, but we are 3,
and he is 1.

10:23.790 --> 10:27.826
We will crush him, and then he
will kneel, kneel before zod.

10:27.828 --> 10:30.829
- How about we skip the
kneeling and just get rid

10:30.831 --> 10:33.665
Of superrabbit so we can
take over the planet

10:33.667 --> 10:35.367
With minimal resistance?

10:35.369 --> 10:36.601
- Skip the kneeling?

10:36.603 --> 10:38.970
Why, kneeling is the
most important part.

10:38.972 --> 10:41.373
Come, my witless monkeys.

10:41.375 --> 10:44.042
It's war time!

10:44.044 --> 10:46.177
- [cheering]

10:46.179 --> 10:47.479
[band playing]

10:47.481 --> 10:49.914
[elephants trumpet]

10:53.986 --> 10:58.690
- People of metropolis,
superrabbit has your back.

10:58.692 --> 11:01.393
No harm will come to
you on my watch.

11:01.395 --> 11:04.496
That's a promise.

11:04.498 --> 11:06.297
- Aah!

11:06.299 --> 11:07.932
[arrooo]

11:07.934 --> 11:11.002
- But will you
keep that promise?

11:11.004 --> 11:13.171
- General zod?

11:13.173 --> 11:15.306
- I'm not here to
fight you, kal-el.

11:15.308 --> 11:16.941
I'm here to watch
you surrender.

11:16.943 --> 11:20.578
- You're gonna have to make me,
and that's not going

11:20.580 --> 11:21.279
To happen.

11:21.281 --> 11:22.914
- You're right.
It's beneath me.

11:22.916 --> 11:26.251
I'll have my minions do it.

11:30.256 --> 11:32.157
- Rawwr!

11:58.384 --> 12:00.452
- Say it.

12:00.454 --> 12:02.187
- Errr.

12:02.189 --> 12:04.389
I...Surrender.

12:04.391 --> 12:09.894
- Citizens of metropolis,
allow me to introduce you to

12:09.896 --> 12:15.567
Your new king,
king zod of earth!

12:15.569 --> 12:18.503
- Huh?
- What?

12:27.613 --> 12:31.382
- I was defeated for the first
time in my life, so I sought

12:31.384 --> 12:34.953
The guidance of the one
person who could help me.

12:34.955 --> 12:36.254
- Justin timberlake?

12:36.256 --> 12:38.823
- No. My father.

12:48.167 --> 12:50.735
Father!

12:50.737 --> 12:51.936
- Right here, son.

12:51.938 --> 12:53.338
Why are you shouting?

12:53.340 --> 12:55.607
- You'll never
guess what happened.

12:55.609 --> 12:57.175
- You lost a fight.

12:57.177 --> 12:58.343
- Can you believe it?

12:58.345 --> 13:01.679
- Yes, because you
had it coming.

13:01.847 --> 13:03.348
- What? How can you say that?

13:03.350 --> 13:05.350
- You've lost your way, son.

13:05.352 --> 13:09.120
You've become
a superspectacle.

13:09.122 --> 13:10.455
- This was your idea.

13:10.457 --> 13:12.190
"wear a costume," you said.

13:12.192 --> 13:14.025
"be a symbol," you said.

13:14.027 --> 13:17.529
- A symbol of hope,
not of excess.

13:17.531 --> 13:20.098
Showing off is
a poor use of power.

13:20.100 --> 13:24.469
Heroism is about helping
others, not parades

13:24.471 --> 13:26.371
Or grandstanding.

13:26.373 --> 13:27.972
- But I keep metropolis safe.

13:27.974 --> 13:31.309
- Has it ever occurred to
you that you're the reason

13:31.311 --> 13:34.979
Metropolis has the highest
rate of supervillainy

13:34.981 --> 13:36.247
In the world?

13:36.249 --> 13:38.049
You're a magnet for evil,

13:38.051 --> 13:40.552
And now you've
attracted the most

13:40.554 --> 13:45.356
Dangerous threat of all--zod.

13:45.358 --> 13:46.925
- I know I can beat him.

13:46.927 --> 13:50.361
- Not with faora
and that robot at his side.

13:50.363 --> 13:52.697
They're too strong
for you alone.

13:52.699 --> 13:58.036
The only way to win is
to use your head.

13:58.038 --> 13:59.771
Find their weaknesses, son.

13:59.773 --> 14:06.444
Make them your strengths
and be a true hero once again.

14:06.512 --> 14:08.847
- Thanks, pop.

14:11.450 --> 14:14.886
- ¶ all fear our
dreadful king ¶

14:14.888 --> 14:17.922
¶ beware our wicked king ¶

14:17.924 --> 14:20.859
¶ all fear king zod ¶

14:20.861 --> 14:23.895
¶ we writhe in agony ¶

14:23.897 --> 14:26.998
¶ while he lives happily ¶

14:27.000 --> 14:30.468
¶ we beg him for mercy ¶

14:30.470 --> 14:34.639
¶ all fear king zod ¶

14:34.641 --> 14:35.473
- No. Too joyful.

14:35.475 --> 14:39.811
Go back to the slave pits
and write me another.

14:42.081 --> 14:45.750
- Are you sure you
need an anthem?

14:45.752 --> 14:48.620
- Of course. It's basic
conquest etiquette,

14:48.622 --> 14:49.821
My darling.

14:49.823 --> 14:50.788
What's next?

14:50.790 --> 14:52.423
- There's a reporter
here for an interview.

14:52.425 --> 14:53.958
I can toss him out a window.

14:53.960 --> 14:54.893
- No. Send him in.

14:54.895 --> 15:00.031
The earthlings must get
to know their new master.

15:00.033 --> 15:02.934
- Hello. I'm clark kent
from the "daily planet."

15:02.936 --> 15:06.170
If you don't mind, I just
have a few questions.

15:06.172 --> 15:07.238
We'll be done in a jiff.

15:07.240 --> 15:10.108
- You may ask your
questions, word peddler.

15:10.110 --> 15:12.210
- Oh. You're too kind.

15:12.212 --> 15:15.546
Faora, now why do you stay in
a relationship with zod when

15:15.748 --> 15:19.183
He ignores everything
you say, want, and need?

15:19.185 --> 15:22.420
And, thunkian, do you mind
being treated like a child

15:22.422 --> 15:23.855
Because you don't talk?

15:23.857 --> 15:27.225
And, king zod, is all the
dominant bluster just a way

15:27.227 --> 15:30.495
Of dealing with
your insecurities?

15:30.497 --> 15:34.032
And finally, if the 3 of you
have nothing in common, why

15:34.034 --> 15:35.733
Are you together?

15:35.735 --> 15:37.168
- What?
- Huh?

15:37.170 --> 15:39.203
- Destroy this insolent worm!

15:39.205 --> 15:42.240
- Before you do that,
you should know that I'm

15:42.242 --> 15:45.443
Not just a reporter.

15:45.445 --> 15:46.110
- Ohh!

15:46.112 --> 15:49.514
- I'm also a guy who doesn't
like out-of-towners

15:49.516 --> 15:52.483
Messing up my city.

15:52.485 --> 15:54.585
[glass breaks]

15:56.021 --> 15:58.056
- After him!

16:03.095 --> 16:06.364
- You can do better
than zod, you know?

16:06.366 --> 16:08.666
I bet a lot of guys would be
interested in a hot

16:08.668 --> 16:10.735
Super she-predator
like yourself.

16:10.737 --> 16:13.705
- You, uh, you think I'm hot?

16:13.707 --> 16:15.673
- Heck, yeah!

16:15.675 --> 16:18.142
- Heh.

16:18.144 --> 16:19.143
Mmm.

16:19.211 --> 16:22.814
- But I already got
a girlfriend.

16:24.650 --> 16:25.917
- [growling]

16:25.919 --> 16:28.453
- You're not a child.
- Huh?

16:28.455 --> 16:32.056
- You're a full-grown robot,
and you deserve to be

16:32.058 --> 16:33.758
Treated like one.

16:33.760 --> 16:36.627
- Hmm.

16:36.629 --> 16:37.929
- Hup!

16:37.931 --> 16:40.698
- Hup!

16:40.700 --> 16:43.101
- At ease, soldier.

16:49.775 --> 16:52.176
The statue's a bit
much, isn't it?

16:52.178 --> 16:53.444
- You!

16:53.446 --> 16:57.115
You will grovel before me.

16:57.117 --> 16:58.583
- Is this about your height?

16:58.585 --> 17:01.119
You're not that short.

17:02.187 --> 17:03.621
Eh, I guess next to
your friends

17:03.623 --> 17:04.689
You are pretty shrimpy.

17:04.691 --> 17:10.328
Thunkian, close superrabbit's
mouth permanently.

17:10.329 --> 17:11.429
- Err.

17:11.431 --> 17:18.136
- What?! Faora, make
superrabbit beg for mercy now!

17:18.137 --> 17:19.971
- I'm your girlfriend, zod.

17:19.973 --> 17:22.573
I don't take orders from you.

17:22.575 --> 17:24.776
- Fine. You
and I are finished.

17:24.778 --> 17:27.444
Now you will
crush superrabbit.

17:27.446 --> 17:31.082
- You're right about
one of those things.

17:31.084 --> 17:35.153
- Well, your worshipfulness,
it looks like it's

17:35.155 --> 17:38.656
Just you and me.

17:38.658 --> 17:40.558
- Aaah!

17:40.560 --> 17:44.328
[groans]

18:03.949 --> 18:06.050
Aah!

18:19.231 --> 18:21.532
- [gasping]

18:26.972 --> 18:29.540
[sirens]

18:48.293 --> 18:50.094
- Down the rabbit hole.

18:50.096 --> 18:52.597
How predictable.

18:59.972 --> 19:01.439
Hhhnnn.

19:01.441 --> 19:03.474
- Ha ha!

19:11.250 --> 19:13.417
- Aah!

19:33.272 --> 19:35.439
Whoa!

19:37.209 --> 19:38.943
Aah!

19:38.945 --> 19:40.945
Unh!

19:43.148 --> 19:45.316
Aah!

19:45.318 --> 19:46.951
Unh!

19:49.021 --> 19:53.124
- Hey, zod. Kneel
before yourself.

19:56.995 --> 20:00.198
- Ooh. I'm going to hurt me.

20:18.750 --> 20:23.487
- I located a new phantom zone
and stuck zod, faora,

20:23.489 --> 20:26.490
And thunkian inside it.

20:32.431 --> 20:34.899
That was the last
time I saw them.

20:34.901 --> 20:38.269
That was also the last time
I was superrabbit because I

20:38.271 --> 20:42.607
Learned that power
corrupts unless it's

20:42.609 --> 20:45.509
Tempered by humility.

20:50.515 --> 20:52.950
- So you just gave it all up?

20:52.952 --> 20:53.651
- Yep.

20:53.653 --> 20:55.119
- Ha! You made up
that whole story.

20:55.121 --> 20:57.421
No one would ever walk
away from all that power.

20:57.423 --> 21:00.558
Just for that, I'm selling
your stuff and keeping

21:00.560 --> 21:01.592
All the money.

21:01.594 --> 21:03.494
- You were gonna
do that anyway.

21:03.496 --> 21:05.396
- I know.

21:13.038 --> 21:15.873
Hey. Let's shave two seconds
off our walk home by going

21:15.875 --> 21:20.044
Down this dark
and desolate alley.

21:20.046 --> 21:22.179
[meow]

21:28.086 --> 21:29.320
Ohh!

21:29.322 --> 21:32.657
- I'll take those
pretty pearls.

21:37.095 --> 21:39.030
Huh?

21:39.032 --> 21:41.065
Huh? Ohh!

21:41.067 --> 21:42.533
[punching]

21:42.535 --> 21:44.535
Ohh! Ugh!

21:46.672 --> 21:48.839
- Who are you?

21:51.043 --> 21:54.211
- [gravelly voice]
I'm batrabbit.

21:54.213 --> 21:56.814
- Oh, well, don't
expect a tip.

21:56.816 --> 22:00.251
I didn't ask to be saved.

22:02.054 --> 22:04.955
- Ain't I a stinker?
