WEBVTT

00:03.804 --> 00:08.809
( alternative rock playing )

00:08.842 --> 00:11.112
* I'm ten feet tall

00:11.145 --> 00:12.680
( bell ringing )

00:12.713 --> 00:16.284
* Ten feet tall

00:16.317 --> 00:20.154
* I got something

00:20.188 --> 00:22.823
* I got something

00:22.856 --> 00:26.327
* I'll take the world,
and I'll *

00:26.360 --> 00:30.131
* I'll take the night

00:30.164 --> 00:33.634
* Take it for myself

00:33.667 --> 00:37.171
* Take it by myself

00:37.205 --> 00:41.442
* And I ran away from you

00:43.311 --> 00:44.612
( screaming )

00:44.645 --> 00:47.715
* And I ran away from you

00:50.884 --> 00:55.256
* And I ran away from you

00:56.890 --> 00:58.226
( gunshot )

00:58.259 --> 01:02.463
* And I ran away from you

01:07.235 --> 01:08.402
( screaming )

01:08.436 --> 01:11.539
* I'm ten feet tall

01:11.572 --> 01:15.109
* Ten feet tall

01:15.143 --> 01:18.512
* Well, I got something

01:18.546 --> 01:21.515
* I got something

01:21.549 --> 01:25.653
* I'll take the world,
and I'll *

01:25.686 --> 01:28.722
* I'll take the night

01:28.756 --> 01:33.194
* I'll take it for myself

01:33.227 --> 01:36.164
* Take it by myself

01:36.197 --> 01:41.635
* And I ran away from you...

01:43.237 --> 01:45.473
( panting ):
It's okay...

01:45.506 --> 01:46.707
( voice breaking ):
Dad, it's me.

01:46.740 --> 01:47.841
Pick up.

01:47.875 --> 01:49.477
( gunfire )
Stuff's happening
at school.

01:49.510 --> 01:51.645
I need you.
Come and get me.

01:54.948 --> 01:56.317
Please!
Oh, my God.

01:59.453 --> 02:01.722
BOY:
Hey...

02:01.755 --> 02:03.657
DMG rules.

02:15.203 --> 02:17.405
DISPATCHER:
We need to know
what's going on, okay?

02:17.438 --> 02:20.441
WOMAN:
I am on the floor...

02:20.474 --> 02:25.379
( voices yelling and gunshots )

02:28.216 --> 02:30.851
( woman shouting frantically )

02:30.884 --> 02:33.487
MAN:
I've been the principal
at this school for nine years.

02:33.521 --> 02:34.588
We've had problems,
but nothing like this.

02:34.622 --> 02:37.591
Okay, why don't you tell me
what you know so far?

02:37.625 --> 02:39.293
Oh, God, there
were two shooters.

02:39.327 --> 02:40.928
Eight people were killed.

02:40.961 --> 02:43.764
Seven students and
one of my teachers.

02:43.797 --> 02:46.567
12 more kids
were wounded.

02:46.600 --> 02:49.437
It all happened
in like six minutes.

02:49.470 --> 02:50.471
All right, I'm going
to want to talk

02:50.504 --> 02:51.772
to the students, teachers,
security, everybody.

02:51.805 --> 02:54.575
I'll get a list.

02:54.608 --> 02:57.745
DAVID:
Don, found one
of the shooters.

03:00.948 --> 03:03.684
Hey.
Hey.

03:03.717 --> 03:06.420
This is Paul Elins.
He's 17 years old.

03:06.454 --> 03:08.856
He's a senior here
and he was absent today.

03:08.889 --> 03:10.991
The headset, the mask,
the whole thing matches
the witness accounts.

03:11.024 --> 03:12.626
Looks like he killed
this girl right here.

03:12.660 --> 03:14.262
Victim's name
is Becky Flynn.

03:14.295 --> 03:15.763
He shoots her
and then gets
taken out himself.

03:15.796 --> 03:17.898
Thanks.
That has to be
the other shooter.

03:17.931 --> 03:20.000
Security never
got off a round.

03:20.033 --> 03:21.635
So what do we think,
a suicide pact?

03:21.669 --> 03:23.971
Yeah, only the other shooter
couldn't close the deal.

03:24.004 --> 03:25.005
MEGAN:
Or didn't.

03:25.038 --> 03:26.407
If we're talking about
a sociopath,

03:26.440 --> 03:27.708
he might have told
his partner one thing

03:27.741 --> 03:29.277
and had something else
in mind.

03:29.310 --> 03:31.312
He probably escaped
in the crowd.

03:31.345 --> 03:32.980
SWAT found his bag
and all his stuff

03:33.013 --> 03:34.915
ditched in an empty locker
near the exit.

03:34.948 --> 03:38.752
( phone ringing )

03:38.786 --> 03:42.823
Is that hers?

03:43.757 --> 03:47.395
Says "Dad."

03:47.428 --> 03:48.996
It's gonna go to voice mail.

03:58.038 --> 03:59.740
Hello.

04:02.443 --> 04:03.944
Excuse me, sir.
My name is Don Eppes.

04:03.977 --> 04:05.679
I'm with the FBI.

04:05.713 --> 04:10.250
Um, look, sir, I'm afraid
I have some bad news.

04:11.485 --> 04:15.356
We all use math every day,
to predict weather,

04:15.389 --> 04:19.293
to tell time,

04:19.327 --> 04:21.595
to handle money.

04:21.629 --> 04:26.467
Math is more than formulas
and equations.

04:26.500 --> 04:28.369
It's logic...

04:28.402 --> 04:30.338
rationality.

04:30.371 --> 04:31.939
It's using your mind

04:31.972 --> 04:34.742
to solve the biggest mysteries
we know.

04:34.775 --> 04:37.745
Captioning sponsored by
CBS

04:37.778 --> 04:40.781
and
PARAMOUNT NETWORK TELEVISION

04:42.983 --> 04:44.952
Paul Elins was
an honor student.

04:44.985 --> 04:46.487
He excelled in math,
computers

04:46.520 --> 04:47.755
and he got acceptance letters
from

04:47.788 --> 04:49.490
half the schools
in the Ivy League.

04:49.523 --> 04:50.958
All right, so
where's the dark cloud?

04:50.991 --> 04:52.960
Parents divorced
last year.

04:52.993 --> 04:53.894
He fell
into a depression.

04:53.927 --> 04:55.429
Discipline problems...

04:55.463 --> 04:57.965
I mean, why pick up
killing other kids?

04:57.998 --> 04:59.633
There's got to be
some kind of trigger.

04:59.667 --> 05:01.034
All right, so who
were his friends?

05:01.068 --> 05:03.637
I mean, the odds are
a student now, right?

05:03.671 --> 05:04.505
Who was probably absent
today, too.

05:04.538 --> 05:05.939
Yeah, but even if we
isolate his friends,

05:05.973 --> 05:08.041
we could still be
looking at a lot of kids.

05:08.075 --> 05:09.410
DAVID:
Well, this might help.

05:09.443 --> 05:11.912
Student ID.
on the back.ip

05:11.945 --> 05:13.647
School takes attendance

05:13.681 --> 05:16.817
using RFID technology--
radio frequency identification.

05:16.850 --> 05:18.852
That's a tagging system
that companies use

05:18.886 --> 05:20.888
to track packages,
inventory

05:20.921 --> 05:21.989
and shipping
and stuff.

05:22.022 --> 05:23.957
I read the Technology
section.

05:23.991 --> 05:25.993
Yeah, yeah. And?

05:26.026 --> 05:27.895
Chip on the ID communicates
with a network of sensors

05:27.928 --> 05:28.996
around the school.

05:29.029 --> 05:30.964
Central computer
tracks the students.

05:30.998 --> 05:32.366
It's like a GPS system.

05:32.400 --> 05:34.835
That sounds a bit
Big Brother to me.

05:34.868 --> 05:35.836
It's not 100%.

05:35.869 --> 05:37.104
The kids leave it
at home,

05:37.137 --> 05:39.039
they forget it in the locker.
Well, it should
definitely

05:39.072 --> 05:41.942
be able to narrow it down for us
which kids were running away.

05:41.975 --> 05:44.378
Which will tell us who we can
eliminate as suspects.

05:44.412 --> 05:45.879
And anyone who was absent,
we can run down their alibis.

05:45.913 --> 05:48.015
That school has
metal detectors.

05:48.048 --> 05:49.450
How did they get
the guns inside?

05:49.483 --> 05:51.051
They got them
in there somehow.

05:51.084 --> 05:53.954
Well, if the system
each kid is,where

05:53.987 --> 05:56.023
then we should match it
with witness statements

05:56.056 --> 05:57.458
and map
the shooters' route.

05:57.491 --> 05:58.592
By "we," I mean Charlie.

05:58.626 --> 06:02.029
I got you thinking
like a mathematician.

06:02.062 --> 06:04.765
However, I'm not too keen
on your method.

06:04.798 --> 06:07.468
See, there's a natural flaw
in witness statements.

06:07.501 --> 06:10.671
And statistics show that
memory is often unreliable.

06:10.704 --> 06:13.040
Charlie, that's all we got,
so...

06:13.073 --> 06:14.508
Actually, you do have
more than that.

06:14.542 --> 06:16.777
Neptune.

06:16.810 --> 06:17.845
Neptune? As in the planet?

06:17.878 --> 06:20.981
The discovery of Neptune
occurred because scientists

06:21.014 --> 06:22.883
inferred its presence

06:22.916 --> 06:25.018
due to its gravitational force
on other planetary bodies.

06:25.052 --> 06:28.489
From the observable,
we can divine the unobservable.

06:28.522 --> 06:29.923
Right.

06:29.957 --> 06:31.992
CHARLIE:
when we were kids?k we did

06:32.025 --> 06:33.694
The soap and pepper trick.

06:33.727 --> 06:35.062
Yeah, you put pepper
in the water,

06:35.095 --> 06:36.096
you put the soap in

06:36.129 --> 06:37.531
and then the pepper
goes everywhere.

06:37.565 --> 06:39.967
Same principle.
Except let's say the students

06:40.000 --> 06:41.802
are the specks of pepper

06:41.835 --> 06:43.904
and the bar of soap
are the shooters.

06:43.937 --> 06:46.139
The shooters arrive--
and just like the pepper,

06:46.173 --> 06:48.976
repelled, in this case,
by breaking surface tension,

06:49.009 --> 06:50.177
the students flee.

06:50.210 --> 06:52.513
They scatter in
a predictable pattern.

06:52.546 --> 06:53.781
Yeah, how's that?

06:53.814 --> 06:55.048
AMITA:
Using non-linear

06:55.082 --> 06:56.984
pursuit-evasion equations.

06:57.017 --> 06:59.587
Which show how predators
pursue their prey.

06:59.620 --> 07:01.655
Yeah, but wait, you can
see the soap.

07:01.689 --> 07:02.990
Here's the beauty of it.

07:03.023 --> 07:04.157
Let's try this trick again,

07:04.191 --> 07:07.027
but this time
with clear liquid soap.

07:07.060 --> 07:09.096
Now you can't see the soap,

07:09.129 --> 07:12.566
but the pepper behaves in
precisely the same manner.

07:12.600 --> 07:14.768
It's just the same
with our two students.

07:14.802 --> 07:16.103
Though they may
be unobservable,

07:16.136 --> 07:18.205
it's the observable--
the fleeing students,

07:18.238 --> 07:19.940
that will tell us,
not just how

07:19.973 --> 07:21.575
the shooters got
into the school,

07:21.609 --> 07:25.045
but every single move they made
thereafter.

07:25.078 --> 07:26.179
According to students
who were there

07:26.213 --> 07:28.181
these shooters were
out in the open.

07:28.215 --> 07:30.050
Jocks, popular kids,
mainly.

07:30.083 --> 07:32.786
A couple of them said
these guys would point
a gun at one of them

07:32.820 --> 07:33.854
and shoot the person
right next to them.

07:33.887 --> 07:36.223
No one has exactly jumped
to the front of the line

07:36.256 --> 07:38.526
to say they were best pals
with the shooter either.

07:38.559 --> 07:41.028
Isolation also fits
the profile.

07:41.061 --> 07:42.195
Several students said
this kid Paul Elins--

07:42.229 --> 07:43.964
he was a part
of a group of boys.

07:43.997 --> 07:47.067
Called themselves the DMG:
"Dark Matter Guild."

07:47.100 --> 07:48.636
Computer geeks
mostly.

07:48.669 --> 07:50.003
Do we know anything
else about them?

07:50.037 --> 07:51.905
Well, apparently the editor
of the school newspaper

07:51.939 --> 07:53.807
did a profile on them
a couple months back.

07:53.841 --> 07:57.511
Her name's Karen Camden.
So, we're running that down.

07:57.545 --> 07:59.112
Why is that name
so familiar?

07:59.146 --> 08:01.048
She was the other girl
in the closet

08:01.081 --> 08:03.016
when Becky Flynn was shot.

08:03.050 --> 08:07.821
Whoever said that I'm
the leader of DMG,
they're full of it.

08:07.855 --> 08:09.890
Actually, you said it, Greg,

08:09.923 --> 08:11.925
in an interview with
Karen Camden.

08:11.959 --> 08:15.095
All right, you want to know
about the DMG?

08:15.128 --> 08:16.597
It's simple.

08:16.630 --> 08:18.165
We're just a guild
of gamers, that's all.

08:18.198 --> 08:19.266
A guild?

08:19.299 --> 08:22.603
I take it you don't know much
about M-M-O-R-P-G's.

08:22.636 --> 08:25.706
Like starting with
what the hell they are-- no.

08:25.739 --> 08:28.041
Massive Multi-Player Online
Role-Playing Games. A guild

08:28.075 --> 08:30.310
is a team
of players online.

08:30.343 --> 08:32.045
Of which Paul Elins
was a member.

08:32.079 --> 08:35.048
Look, I'm as shocked about what
Paul did as anybody else.

08:35.082 --> 08:38.986
What is the Dark Matter Guild?

08:39.019 --> 08:41.121
Like I said, we're a team.

08:41.154 --> 08:43.991
Dark Matter is just
a component of the universe

08:44.024 --> 08:46.326
that exists all around us
that remains unseen.

08:46.359 --> 08:47.795
Well, you
and your pals

08:47.828 --> 08:49.062
just stick to video games

08:49.096 --> 08:51.198
or do you engage in other
activities, as well?

08:51.231 --> 08:52.966
I don't know anything
about the shooting,

08:53.000 --> 08:54.201
if that's what you mean.

08:54.234 --> 08:55.769
Why were you absent
from school?

08:55.803 --> 08:57.070
I had a cold.

08:57.104 --> 08:58.872
You look pretty
healthy right now.

08:58.906 --> 09:00.574
Look, I told you,
I don't know anything.

09:00.608 --> 09:02.610
And I can't think of anybody
in the guild

09:02.643 --> 09:04.011
that would condone
what Paul did,

09:04.044 --> 09:06.780
let alone
be a part of it.

09:06.814 --> 09:09.182
The DMG
are gamers,

09:09.216 --> 09:12.586
not killers.

09:17.090 --> 09:21.829
Poor Becky.

09:21.862 --> 09:25.999
I keep thinking
why didn't he shoot me?

09:26.033 --> 09:27.200
That's not your fault, Karen.

09:27.234 --> 09:30.070
And you're never going
to know why.

09:30.103 --> 09:31.404
It could be anything.
It could be because

09:31.438 --> 09:35.743
you wrote that article
in the school newspaper
about the DMG.

09:35.776 --> 09:37.945
I just wanted kids to understand
who they were.

09:37.978 --> 09:41.214
So many kids
dissed them, you know.

09:41.248 --> 09:46.019
Calling them dorks,
cyber-geeks.

09:46.053 --> 09:48.221
You know, jocks pick on geeks
every day.

09:48.255 --> 09:49.857
Bullying happens.

09:49.890 --> 09:52.292
It just doesn't
usually end like this.

09:53.994 --> 09:58.899
I could
see his eyes

09:58.932 --> 10:02.002
through his mask.

10:02.035 --> 10:05.773
He looked so angry.

10:05.806 --> 10:07.307
And what about
the other shooter?

10:09.276 --> 10:10.644
I never saw him.

10:10.678 --> 10:12.379
But he shot Paul Elins.

10:12.412 --> 10:16.249
Yeah.

10:16.283 --> 10:19.219
After I just sat there
and waited.

10:19.252 --> 10:23.891
I tried to help
Becky, but...

10:23.924 --> 10:28.261
When I didn't hear anything,
I just ran.

10:30.097 --> 10:33.901
You got to know these kids
pretty well, didn't you?

10:33.934 --> 10:36.136
I guess.

10:36.169 --> 10:38.271
Karen,

10:38.305 --> 10:40.440
I need to find
that other boy

10:40.473 --> 10:43.443
before he hurts
someone else
or he hurts himself.

10:43.476 --> 10:47.214
Do you have any idea who
that second shooter might be?

10:47.247 --> 10:51.018
There's a half a dozen boys
in the DMG.

10:51.051 --> 10:52.085
It could be
any one of them.

10:52.119 --> 10:54.287
Yeah, but did you get a feeling
about any of them?

10:54.321 --> 10:56.389
Did you have a thought that
maybe one of them

10:56.423 --> 10:58.892
was capable
of something
like this?

10:58.926 --> 11:02.362
Anything you say to me
is just between us.

11:04.197 --> 11:08.335
Paul used to hang with
this kid named Justin Price.

11:08.368 --> 11:11.238
And what makes you think him?

11:11.271 --> 11:16.043
Justin's scary... into guns...

11:16.076 --> 11:19.146
always bragging about how
he has this huge collection.

11:20.480 --> 11:23.216
And he always used
to talk about Columbine.

11:25.518 --> 11:27.687
Thanks.

11:28.922 --> 11:30.190
Hey, guys.

11:30.223 --> 11:32.993
Kid on the left
is Justin Price.

11:33.026 --> 11:34.895
Karen Camden
describes him as

11:34.928 --> 11:37.030
some kind of
angry loner type.
Mom's a single parent.

11:37.064 --> 11:38.365
She travels a lot.

11:38.398 --> 11:40.100
Neighbor said she's away
at a convention right now,

11:40.133 --> 11:41.168
so we checked the house.
There's no sign of him.

11:41.201 --> 11:45.005
Yeah, I got a file on him.
He's got a juvie record.

11:45.038 --> 11:46.439
Out of the 77 kids
who didn't show up

11:46.473 --> 11:47.707
on the attendance data that day,

11:47.741 --> 11:50.410
we were able to account for 46
of them who were actually there,

11:50.443 --> 11:51.511
just not wearing
their ID badges.

11:51.544 --> 11:53.180
So what's that?
Like 31 absent, huh?

11:53.213 --> 11:55.315
Yeah. Including
Justin Price.

11:55.348 --> 11:56.183
So the ATF

11:56.216 --> 11:58.218
trace on the guns
at the school show

11:58.251 --> 12:00.821
that they were registered
to a John Price, deceased.

12:00.854 --> 12:03.223
He's Justin Price's uncle.
The guns were off the grid,

12:03.256 --> 12:05.325
but, apparently, he
voluntarily registered them.

12:05.358 --> 12:06.894
All right, I'd say we got
our second shooter

12:06.927 --> 12:08.762
there, right?
Hey, guys, what's up?

12:08.796 --> 12:11.899
Our preliminary analysis
of the first minutes
of the attack

12:11.932 --> 12:13.433
show that
the shooters entered

12:13.466 --> 12:14.534
through the southwest entrance.

12:14.567 --> 12:16.003
According to the
police report,

12:16.036 --> 12:18.038
the southwest metal detectors
were down

12:18.071 --> 12:19.973
for scheduled maintenance.

12:20.007 --> 12:21.408
Coincidence?

12:21.441 --> 12:22.542
Well, as a prominent
cosmologist

12:22.575 --> 12:24.377
once said,

12:24.411 --> 12:27.447
"Coincidence is the last refuge
of the uninspired."

12:27.480 --> 12:29.549
What cosmologist said that?

12:29.582 --> 12:31.418
Oh...

12:32.585 --> 12:33.553
Hey, are these

12:33.586 --> 12:35.555
the two shooters?
!
Yeah.

12:35.588 --> 12:37.457
Kid on the right
is the other one we
think might be. Why?

12:37.490 --> 12:39.426
I know this place.

12:39.459 --> 12:40.861
This is an all-night cyber cafe.

12:40.894 --> 12:41.694
Yeah, they've got

12:41.728 --> 12:43.864
a retro-version
of Asteroids there.

12:43.897 --> 12:44.998
I quite enjoy it.
Karen Camden

12:45.032 --> 12:47.367
said the DMG kids were teased
for being "cyber geeks."

12:47.400 --> 12:49.336
If they're
hiding out,

12:49.369 --> 12:51.338
they'd probably
go someplace comforting.

12:51.371 --> 12:53.373
And open 24 hours.
All right.

12:53.406 --> 12:55.108
Why don't you guys check it out?

12:55.142 --> 12:58.245
( loud punk rock playing )

12:58.278 --> 12:59.446
He's inside.
In the back room.

12:59.479 --> 13:00.447
Alone?

13:00.480 --> 13:02.182
Yeah. Isolated
in the corner.

13:02.215 --> 13:03.183
You two cover the front.

13:03.216 --> 13:04.417
SWAT's got the back.

13:04.451 --> 13:05.452
Let's do it.

13:09.356 --> 13:14.361
*

13:16.363 --> 13:21.334
* Now I got nowhere to run,
and I got nowhere to hide... *

13:22.369 --> 13:25.305
* ...committing double
homicide... *

13:25.338 --> 13:26.339
Justin Price...!

13:27.975 --> 13:28.341
Gun!

13:34.314 --> 13:35.415
*One shot down
* Whoa *

13:35.448 --> 13:38.451
* Two shot down...

13:38.485 --> 13:40.453
*

13:40.487 --> 13:42.322
Call an ambulance.

13:42.355 --> 13:44.524
No.

13:46.593 --> 13:49.129
He was just a kid.

13:49.162 --> 13:53.000
* Now they are laying
in the dirt... *

13:57.637 --> 14:00.473
So the forensics came back
on Justin Price,

14:00.507 --> 14:02.475
and the blood on his boots
does match the victims

14:02.509 --> 14:03.610
at the crime scene.

14:03.643 --> 14:05.345
We got a
second shooter.

14:05.378 --> 14:06.579
Yeah, but there's
another problem.

14:06.613 --> 14:10.450
The gun that David
and Colby found on Price
at the cyber cafe

14:10.483 --> 14:12.552
only matches two
of the five kills

14:12.585 --> 14:14.487
that he's credited with
at the high school.

14:14.521 --> 14:16.656
Yeah. Wait,
he didn't have
any others on him?

14:16.689 --> 14:17.657
No. And,
like the first shooter,

14:17.690 --> 14:19.960
he was probably
packing more
than one gun,

14:19.993 --> 14:21.628
which means that gun
is still out there.

14:21.661 --> 14:23.663
Yeah. Plus the rest
of the uncle's arsenal.

14:23.696 --> 14:25.465
Right. So now we have
a bunch of guns

14:25.498 --> 14:27.500
and a bunch of
really emotional kids

14:27.534 --> 14:28.568
who might have
the potential

14:28.601 --> 14:29.669
of getting their
hands on them.

14:29.702 --> 14:30.670
All right,
so let's get every

14:30.703 --> 14:33.506
single kid in that DMG
on surveillance, right?

14:33.540 --> 14:35.075
I mean, we got
to find those guns.

14:35.108 --> 14:41.949
At 11:02:58, Scott Kang
was at X-Y coordinates 335/

14:41.982 --> 14:43.550
211,

14:43.583 --> 14:45.352
heading north.

14:45.385 --> 14:46.920
Oh, evolution

14:46.954 --> 14:48.421
is a cruel mistress.

14:48.455 --> 14:49.957
Human intellect

14:49.990 --> 14:53.493
grows unbounded, while our

14:53.526 --> 14:56.629
emotional maturity
is sadly behind.

14:56.663 --> 14:57.664
Larry?

14:57.697 --> 14:58.999
High school

14:59.032 --> 15:00.968
will always be
high school, you know?

15:01.001 --> 15:04.271
The jocks versus the geeks,
and the popular versus

15:04.304 --> 15:05.538
the ostracized.

15:05.572 --> 15:06.339
I remember.

15:06.373 --> 15:07.307
Yeah, but,
you know,
time was

15:07.340 --> 15:09.676
when we solved our differences
with fists,

15:09.709 --> 15:11.611
not automatic weaponry.

15:11.644 --> 15:15.382
Times change. And it's not

15:15.415 --> 15:18.385
just guns. RFID chips
and tracking systems.

15:18.418 --> 15:20.487
If this weren't
the new millennium,

15:20.520 --> 15:22.990
I'd swear it's
all very 1984.

15:23.023 --> 15:25.993
Mmm. You know, Megan
feels the same way.

15:26.026 --> 15:27.727
Speaking of,

15:27.760 --> 15:30.297
what was that smile
she gave you all about?

15:30.330 --> 15:33.700
Oh, it's her smile.
Ask her.

15:33.733 --> 15:35.268
Wait a second.

15:35.302 --> 15:36.970
Can someone
clue me in here?

15:37.004 --> 15:40.207
Well, the fact is,
for some time now,

15:40.240 --> 15:42.509
though it's not my
specific discipline,

15:42.542 --> 15:46.713
I have felt a certain chemistry
with Megan.

15:46.746 --> 15:50.050
Which you've kept
fairly well under wraps.

15:50.083 --> 15:53.720
Precisely why my next overture
will be overt.

15:53.753 --> 15:57.090
You're going
to ask Megan out, Larry?

15:57.124 --> 15:59.259
Yeah. But I don't know.

15:59.292 --> 16:01.161
Given our
disjointed universes,

16:01.194 --> 16:02.962
I'm... I'm fearful.

16:05.065 --> 16:06.633
What is it,
Charlie?

16:08.568 --> 16:10.337
This last grouping
of data entries...

16:10.370 --> 16:14.007
It shows students running
towards the shooter,

16:14.041 --> 16:16.109
and not away from him.

16:16.143 --> 16:19.512
But that obviously
doesn't make sense at all.

16:19.546 --> 16:21.014
It could be an anomaly
in the data.

16:21.048 --> 16:22.749
Or an anomaly
in the school.

16:22.782 --> 16:24.451
These school plans
are old.

16:24.484 --> 16:28.288
Walls could have been moved,
obstructions introduced...

16:28.321 --> 16:30.757
If you're suggesting what
I think you're suggesting--

16:30.790 --> 16:34.627
field work-- God, I vowed never
to return to high school.

16:34.661 --> 16:37.364
Mrs. Price, your son
Justin was associated

16:37.397 --> 16:38.798
with a group
of boys at school

16:38.831 --> 16:41.134
known as the
"Dark Matter Guild."

16:41.168 --> 16:43.370
What can you tell me about them?

16:43.403 --> 16:46.306
Just that they were friends
who would hang out,

16:46.339 --> 16:47.640
play video games.

16:47.674 --> 16:50.277
And have you ever
met any of them?

16:50.310 --> 16:53.646
I met Paul Elins a few times.

16:53.680 --> 16:56.249
I never met any
of the other kids.

16:56.283 --> 16:59.186
I work in health care.
It's long hours.

16:59.219 --> 17:01.754
I'm on the road
three days a week.

17:01.788 --> 17:04.757
I wasn't able
to keep tabs on Justin

17:04.791 --> 17:07.294
the way I would have liked to.

17:07.327 --> 17:09.762
That sounds like
you were concerned.

17:09.796 --> 17:14.301
I asked my brother John
to spend some time with him.

17:14.334 --> 17:17.270
You know, I wanted him
to have a male role model.

17:17.304 --> 17:18.605
He was in the service.

17:18.638 --> 17:21.741
I thought he could teach him.

17:21.774 --> 17:23.643
But, after John was killed,

17:23.676 --> 17:26.646
it affected Justin.

17:26.679 --> 17:29.182
Nothing that I said mattered.

17:29.216 --> 17:31.684
And, Mrs. Price,
do you know where

17:31.718 --> 17:34.554
your brother John kept
his collection of guns?

17:34.587 --> 17:38.125
I asked him to get rid of them.

17:38.158 --> 17:41.228
I assumed he had.

17:41.261 --> 17:44.431
We think there's
more guns out there.

17:44.464 --> 17:47.634
I ran a credit check,

17:47.667 --> 17:51.204
and found a storage unit
that was leased in your name.

17:51.238 --> 17:53.373
The fees were paid
by money order.

17:53.406 --> 17:55.408
I didn't know anything about it.

17:58.245 --> 17:59.579
You think I'm an awful mother,

17:59.612 --> 18:01.681
don't you?

18:01.714 --> 18:04.117
I think you're a woman
who's lost her son

18:04.151 --> 18:05.752
and feels responsible.

18:05.785 --> 18:08.855
My son murdered a teacher.

18:08.888 --> 18:11.891
He killed all those children.

18:11.924 --> 18:15.228
How do I live with that?

18:18.431 --> 18:20.367
The banality of evil
is only banal

18:20.400 --> 18:23.136
to those who never see it.

18:23.170 --> 18:26.206
My senior year,
a student showed up
at school with a gun.

18:26.239 --> 18:27.707
He held two
kids hostage.

18:27.740 --> 18:29.209
What happened?

18:29.242 --> 18:30.577
Eventually,
he let them go.

18:30.610 --> 18:32.812
Then he climbed
up to the roof
and jumped.

18:32.845 --> 18:35.782
It's a different
world than the one
I grew up in.

18:37.450 --> 18:40.887
Any structural discrepancies
we had hoped to find,

18:40.920 --> 18:42.889
we're not finding them.

18:42.922 --> 18:44.424
Now, given the rate
at which my calculations

18:44.457 --> 18:46.893
show that the shooters moved...

18:46.926 --> 18:49.562
Hey, you guys, you know what?
I'll tell you what.

18:49.596 --> 18:52.465
You guys mind if I borrow
your walkie-talkies?

18:52.499 --> 18:53.533
Thank you.

18:53.566 --> 18:54.601
Thanks.

18:55.802 --> 18:58.438
What... what are you
thinking here, Charles?

18:58.471 --> 19:00.907
You suggested I test
my equations in the field.

19:00.940 --> 19:02.642
Time me.

19:30.837 --> 19:33.306
Okay, Larry. Time?

19:33.340 --> 19:34.941
Uh... 58 seconds.

19:34.974 --> 19:36.643
Charles, what is it?

19:38.010 --> 19:39.779
I need to talk to Don.

19:42.349 --> 19:45.485
We searched that
storage locker that
Justin Price rented.

19:45.518 --> 19:47.320
Found some unused ammo.

19:47.354 --> 19:49.256
But if he was storing
guns there once,
they're not there now.

19:49.289 --> 19:50.890
We did find this.
Take a look.

19:50.923 --> 19:53.260
It's a security schedule.

19:53.293 --> 19:54.961
Yeah. It shows that
the metal detectors
were down

19:54.994 --> 19:56.396
at the southeast entrance
of the school

19:56.429 --> 19:57.830
the morning
of the shooting.

19:57.864 --> 19:59.599
All right, so they knew
exactly where to enter.

19:59.632 --> 20:02.235
Yeah. We found downloaded
blueprints of the school, too.

20:06.373 --> 20:08.975
Hey. What's this?

20:09.008 --> 20:11.344
It's a home-made
"modded" video game

20:11.378 --> 20:13.446
we took off of
Justin Price's laptop.

20:13.480 --> 20:16.015
He was playing with Paul Elins
the night before the shooting.

20:16.048 --> 20:18.285
What do you think? Like
some kind of dress rehearsal?

20:18.318 --> 20:20.887
Only they weren't the only ones
playing. We have evidence

20:20.920 --> 20:23.990
other DMG kids were online
as well.

20:24.023 --> 20:25.725
Hey, guys, there's a problem

20:25.758 --> 20:28.761
with the RFID data
I need to show you guys.

20:28.795 --> 20:31.398
All right.
Well, put it up.

20:31.431 --> 20:32.899
Okay, I managed
to map the movements

20:32.932 --> 20:34.701
of the students.

20:34.734 --> 20:36.703
Now, these red dots--

20:36.736 --> 20:37.904
these are students.

20:37.937 --> 20:39.706
And the black X's--
those are the shooters.

20:39.739 --> 20:41.874
Now, during the first two
minutes of the attack,

20:41.908 --> 20:43.610
the students behaved
as one would expect.

20:43.643 --> 20:45.011
All right. Well, then,
what's the problem?

20:45.044 --> 20:47.046
Eventually, a group of students

20:47.079 --> 20:50.750
actually started moving
toward shooter number two.

20:50.783 --> 20:53.820
Maybe there was
a dead end over there
or something.

20:53.853 --> 20:55.522
No. No. I walked those halls.

20:55.555 --> 20:56.523
There was no dead end, David.

20:56.556 --> 20:58.958
But check this out. These are

20:58.991 --> 21:01.060
the locations
and the times of death

21:01.093 --> 21:02.529
of our murdered victims.

21:02.562 --> 21:04.464
Now, according
to the data,

21:04.497 --> 21:07.467
the time between the murder
of victim number four

21:07.500 --> 21:09.402
and the murder
of victim number seven

21:09.436 --> 21:10.703
was 33 seconds.

21:10.737 --> 21:12.905
However, I retraced

21:12.939 --> 21:15.074
the steps
of shooter number two,

21:15.107 --> 21:17.377
and I found that where

21:17.410 --> 21:19.612
victim number four
was murdered

21:19.646 --> 21:23.015
to where victims numbers five,
six and seven were murdered,

21:23.049 --> 21:24.651
took twice that amount of time.

21:24.684 --> 21:25.918
So what does that mean?

21:25.952 --> 21:29.889
We know that shooter number one
took out these three victims.

21:29.922 --> 21:32.592
And we know shooter number two
took out these two.

21:32.625 --> 21:34.694
What about the
other three victims?

21:34.727 --> 21:36.028
There's only one explanation

21:36.062 --> 21:37.830
for the aberration
in the anomaly,

21:37.864 --> 21:41.468
and that is that you guys aren't
just looking for a missing gun.

21:41.501 --> 21:44.404
Guess what? You're looking
for a third shooter.

21:46.673 --> 21:49.008
( hammer cocking, gun firing )

22:03.723 --> 22:05.858
Agent Reeves,

22:05.892 --> 22:07.460
my secretary says
that you think

22:07.494 --> 22:08.361
there was
a third shooter.

22:08.395 --> 22:08.928
I'm afraid that's
what it looks like.

22:08.961 --> 22:09.696
First these shootings,

22:09.729 --> 22:11.831
then Justin Price
gunned down.

22:11.864 --> 22:13.366
Now you say another one
of my kids is involved?

22:13.400 --> 22:14.701
Where does this end?

22:14.734 --> 22:17.570
I think as soon
as we find this
third gunman.

22:17.604 --> 22:19.806
I wanted to reopen school,
get the kids back

22:19.839 --> 22:21.374
to some kind
of normal routine.

22:21.408 --> 22:22.742
I can see now
that's not possible.

22:22.775 --> 22:23.943
Mr. Northrup,
right now we need
your cooperation.

22:23.976 --> 22:28.515
We need the files of
everyone associated
with the DMG.

22:28.548 --> 22:30.383
That might be a problem.

22:30.417 --> 22:31.551
What do you mean? Why?

22:31.584 --> 22:35.522
Well, the parents
of these children
feel their kids

22:35.555 --> 22:37.023
are being
unfairly singled out.

22:37.056 --> 22:39.091
They've hired lawyers
and they make it clear

22:39.125 --> 22:40.393
that they won't consent.

22:40.427 --> 22:41.961
So you're saying we need
a court order?

22:41.994 --> 22:44.363
I'm afraid that's what
it's going to take.

22:46.666 --> 22:48.768
There may be
another way.

22:48.801 --> 22:50.036
How?

22:50.069 --> 22:52.739
Construct the information
from public records.

22:52.772 --> 22:56.142
Military personnel have the same
access as colleges.

22:56.175 --> 22:57.143
Transcripts,

22:57.176 --> 22:59.412
activities,
club memberships.

22:59.446 --> 23:00.413
Justin Price

23:00.447 --> 23:01.380
had a criminal record.

23:01.414 --> 23:03.950
Maybe one of the members
of the DMG does, too.

23:03.983 --> 23:05.151
Anything in
the public record

23:05.184 --> 23:06.553
we can use
the Patriot Act
to get at.

23:06.586 --> 23:08.521
Eight dead, 12 wounded.

23:08.555 --> 23:11.390
I'd call that an act
of domestic terrorism.

23:12.792 --> 23:13.760
MEGAN:
More files.

23:13.793 --> 23:14.861
Sorry, team.

23:14.894 --> 23:16.463
Oh, it's okay.

23:16.496 --> 23:17.930
Charlie promised to take a look
at the data

23:17.964 --> 23:19.799
for my solar physics
presentation.

23:19.832 --> 23:21.468
Thank you.
And you still think

23:21.501 --> 23:23.102
you can do this
in one day?

23:23.135 --> 23:25.438
Yeah, using my Support Vector
Classifier, yeah. Sure.

23:25.472 --> 23:28.107
See, the algorithm's
going to go through
it all, okay?

23:28.140 --> 23:30.477
Grades, activities,
disciplinary actions--

23:30.510 --> 23:33.946
to evaluate traits
ascribed to the FBI's
School Shooter Profile.

23:33.980 --> 23:36.516
Still seems like
a really tall order.

23:36.549 --> 23:39.519
You know, Michelangelo
always said that his

23:39.552 --> 23:40.987
sculptures
already existed.

23:41.020 --> 23:44.757
It was merely up
to him to release them
from their prison.

23:44.791 --> 23:47.527
Well, what he means
is that this process

23:47.560 --> 23:49.161
is a lot like that
of a sculptor.

23:49.195 --> 23:52.465
Preserving only
what's relevant
to the image he seeks,

23:52.499 --> 23:53.833
a sculptor
chips away at a block.

23:53.866 --> 23:54.867
Well, in this case,

23:54.901 --> 23:57.236
the algorithm tells the
computer which details

23:57.269 --> 23:58.938
from the public records
to keep and which

23:58.971 --> 24:02.241
to "chip away at"-- which
to discard as irrelevant--

24:02.274 --> 24:03.643
until slowly an image appears

24:03.676 --> 24:07.046
from this massive block
of data...

24:07.079 --> 24:08.715
which, you know,
if we're lucky,

24:08.748 --> 24:11.551
correlates with an already
existing image:

24:11.584 --> 24:13.853
a profile
of our random school shooter.

24:13.886 --> 24:15.522
I know a lot of women

24:15.555 --> 24:16.656
who'd like to get ahold
of your algorithm

24:16.689 --> 24:20.092
and run it against the personals
to find the perfect man.

24:20.126 --> 24:21.393
Oh, hey,

24:21.427 --> 24:23.996
you know you said
we were supposed to do
something earlier,

24:24.030 --> 24:24.831
remember?
You said it.
What?

24:24.864 --> 24:26.833
We're supposed
to do it. Let's go.

24:26.866 --> 24:28.200
Right.
See ya.

24:28.234 --> 24:29.602
Right. Bye.

24:31.704 --> 24:35.575
What was that about?

24:35.608 --> 24:37.209
Merely a very crude
attempt

24:37.243 --> 24:41.781
at lending privacy.

24:41.814 --> 24:46.018
At the risk of sounding
embarrassingly misguided,

24:46.052 --> 24:48.788
would you care
to join me for dinner?

24:48.821 --> 24:50.189
Or a show, perhaps?

24:50.222 --> 24:53.259
Or maybe even some
terpsichorean pleasure?

25:00.733 --> 25:02.535
I don't know what
the third one means,

25:02.569 --> 25:03.870
but dinner sounds nice.

25:03.903 --> 25:04.971
Okay.

25:05.004 --> 25:05.972
( chuckles )

25:06.005 --> 25:07.574
On one condition,
though:

25:07.607 --> 25:09.308
you have to take me
for a ride in the car.

25:09.341 --> 25:10.209
Delighted.

25:10.242 --> 25:11.177
Call me.

25:11.210 --> 25:13.045
I will.
I will call you.

25:13.079 --> 25:14.547
( chuckles )

25:21.921 --> 25:23.756
Charlie said he's halfway
through his analysis.

25:23.790 --> 25:25.558
So far,
he's got no hits.

25:25.592 --> 25:27.594
We're stuck without
those student files,

25:27.627 --> 25:28.628
I can tell you that.

25:28.661 --> 25:29.962
What about
the court orders?

25:29.996 --> 25:32.599
The kids' lawyers
are hemming and hawing,

25:32.632 --> 25:33.966
so it may take the judge
another day.

25:34.000 --> 25:35.001
I'm hoping
this may help.

25:35.034 --> 25:37.804
I found on the school's ISP
in the deleted files

25:37.837 --> 25:40.139
an e-mail sent out
the day before the attack

25:40.172 --> 25:42.575
cc'ing all the members
of the DMG

25:42.609 --> 25:45.578
telling them to be careful
at school the next morning.

25:45.612 --> 25:47.580
Guess who sent it?
What, Gregory Dietrich?

25:47.614 --> 25:49.782
There you go.
Yeah. So I'm gonna
give it to the judge

25:49.816 --> 25:51.283
and I'm hoping
if we push,

25:51.317 --> 25:53.219
we might be able
to get a warrant
for his file

25:53.252 --> 25:54.654
in the next couple
of hours.

25:54.687 --> 25:55.521
All right. Do it.
Pick up the kid,

25:55.554 --> 25:57.624
but let's be careful now,
all right?

26:00.326 --> 26:01.961
Still revisiting
high school, Charles?

26:01.994 --> 26:04.731
Just mapping our shooters'
third route.

26:04.764 --> 26:09.669
You got a date, huh?
You don't seem
too excited.

26:09.702 --> 26:12.304
Mine is an inner frenzy.

26:12.338 --> 26:14.841
Like some highly agitated
molecular brew.

26:14.874 --> 26:17.610
I can't even settle
on a restaurant.

26:17.644 --> 26:20.146
Well, you know,
Italian's always romantic.

26:20.179 --> 26:22.615
The kinetics
of angel hair
and red sauce,

26:22.649 --> 26:24.817
it's a bit too much
of a challenge, I'm afraid.

26:24.851 --> 26:27.019
Plus, I think I prefer
not to wear a bib.

26:27.053 --> 26:30.389
I think you need to loosen up,
you know?

26:30.422 --> 26:33.125
Free your molecules,
and your ass will follow.

26:33.159 --> 26:34.727
Oh, yeah, well,
sound advice.

26:37.263 --> 26:40.399
AMITA:
I just ran Gregory Dietrich's
student file through analysis.

26:40.432 --> 26:41.668
He's the leader
of the DMG.

26:41.701 --> 26:43.102
He scored off the charts

26:43.135 --> 26:44.671
on the FBI's School
Shooter Profile.

26:44.704 --> 26:45.672
Our algorithm

26:45.705 --> 26:47.840
came through, my man.

26:49.108 --> 26:51.043
Larry-- still debating

26:51.077 --> 26:52.411
the complexities of capellini.

26:52.444 --> 26:54.346
No, I'm just considering
the complexities

26:54.380 --> 26:56.115
of shooter three's route.

26:56.148 --> 27:00.419
If your main goal was simply
to shoot other students,

27:00.452 --> 27:03.289
why such a convoluted path?

27:03.322 --> 27:05.057
I don't know.

27:05.091 --> 27:06.859
Insanity maybe?
Oh, no.

27:06.893 --> 27:11.664
Even a crazy person can get
from point "A" to point "B."

27:11.698 --> 27:13.432
MEGAN:
Two months ago,

27:13.465 --> 27:14.734
Gregory Dietrich made
an online purchase

27:14.767 --> 27:16.402
of an "Evil Twin" kit.

27:16.435 --> 27:17.469
What is that?

27:17.503 --> 27:21.240
It's a hacking device
to tap into WIFI networks

27:21.273 --> 27:22.274
and steal
sensitive data.

27:22.308 --> 27:24.210
So what?
So they can get blueprints

27:24.243 --> 27:26.145
and security schedules,
stuff like that?

27:26.178 --> 27:28.380
Exactly like that.
Our guys detected
a WIFI breach

27:28.414 --> 27:30.049
at the high school
security data base

27:30.082 --> 27:32.051
a week after Dietrich
bought the device.

27:32.084 --> 27:33.052
Traced it to him?

27:33.085 --> 27:35.454
Yeah, the kid's
not so smart,
after all.

27:35.487 --> 27:37.857
Further proof of that.
Surveillance just saw him

27:37.890 --> 27:39.859
running into his house
like a man on a mission.

27:39.892 --> 27:41.460
Ah, the lawyer
must have tipped
him off.

27:41.493 --> 27:42.829
He's making his move.

27:51.804 --> 27:53.039
COLBY:
I can't get my head around

27:53.072 --> 27:55.875
this whole high school
shooting thing, you know.

27:55.908 --> 27:57.309
I mean, I came
from a small town.

27:57.343 --> 28:00.346
There's 200 kids
in my high school,
not 2,100.

28:00.379 --> 28:02.448
Everybody knew everybody.

28:02.481 --> 28:04.150
If some punk
was running around

28:04.183 --> 28:06.986
with a pile of guns and bad
intentions, we'd know about it.

28:07.019 --> 28:09.221
I don't get it
either, man.

28:09.255 --> 28:12.391
Where I grew up, this kind
of stuff didn't happen.

28:12.424 --> 28:13.993
Don't get me wrong.

28:14.026 --> 28:18.798
Kids got shot, but it was over
something, you know?

28:18.831 --> 28:22.869
Pair of sneakers, insult,
drugs.

28:22.902 --> 28:26.839
It was definitely stupid,
but looking at those kids

28:26.873 --> 28:29.108
shot in their own school...

28:31.277 --> 28:35.447
Wouldn't have thought
about it at the time, but...

28:35.481 --> 28:37.149
maybe we were luckier
than we thought

28:37.183 --> 28:39.185
growing up where we did.

28:40.386 --> 28:42.822
Yeah.

28:42.855 --> 28:44.891
There he is.

28:44.924 --> 28:47.794
Five bucks says he runs.

28:47.827 --> 28:50.496
Yeah? Ten bucks
says I catch him.

29:07.847 --> 29:09.181
I got the bag!

29:10.582 --> 29:11.851
( siren blips )

29:14.553 --> 29:16.355
( tires squeal )

29:20.526 --> 29:22.494
You should spend a little
more time in P.E., kid.

29:22.528 --> 29:25.164
Going hunting, Gregory?

29:25.197 --> 29:26.398
I got nothing to say!

29:26.432 --> 29:30.536
Yeah. That one's new.
Stand up. Let's go.

29:31.370 --> 29:32.839
( gunshots )

29:35.574 --> 29:37.309
WOMAN:
My client already told you

29:37.343 --> 29:39.311
he had nothing to do
with the attack

29:39.345 --> 29:40.446
on the school.

29:40.479 --> 29:43.182
Your client was in possession
of a semiautomatic weapon.

29:43.215 --> 29:44.851
A gun that was part
of a collection

29:44.884 --> 29:46.986
that was owned by
Justin Price's uncle.

29:47.019 --> 29:49.055
Which doesn't prove a thing
,unless that gun

29:49.088 --> 29:50.356
was used in the attack.

29:50.389 --> 29:51.423
Why'd you have it?

29:51.457 --> 29:53.192
You don't have
to answer that.

29:53.225 --> 29:56.128
No, no, it's okay.

29:56.162 --> 29:57.263
I want to answer him.

29:57.296 --> 29:58.931
Justin gave me the gun.

29:58.965 --> 30:00.599
We'd go off
into the woods.

30:00.632 --> 30:02.368
We'd fire off a couple rounds
at cans and stuff.

30:02.401 --> 30:03.569
And while
you were out there,

30:03.602 --> 30:06.572
no one ever mentioned going
and shooting up the school?

30:06.605 --> 30:08.407
That I won't let him
answer.

30:08.440 --> 30:10.943
You bought a device
to hack into the
school's database

30:10.977 --> 30:13.312
to steal blueprints.
We have your name right here.

30:13.345 --> 30:15.481
We traced it to you.
It's your name,
isn't it?

30:15.514 --> 30:17.316
Those blueprints
were for my game.

30:17.349 --> 30:18.918
For authenticity.

30:18.951 --> 30:20.219
For authenticity?

30:20.252 --> 30:21.487
Wake up.

30:21.520 --> 30:22.855
These are kids
you went to school with.

30:22.889 --> 30:24.090
They were shot
in cold blood.

30:24.123 --> 30:25.491
Authenticity.

30:25.524 --> 30:26.525
It wasn't me!

30:26.558 --> 30:28.294
But you hated them,
didn't you?

30:28.327 --> 30:29.528
Look, why don't you guys

30:29.561 --> 30:30.596
try living with it

30:30.629 --> 30:31.931
every day?

30:31.964 --> 30:33.165
The way they look
at you

30:33.199 --> 30:35.467
like, like you're
not even there.

30:35.501 --> 30:37.036
So you took your revenge.

30:37.069 --> 30:40.572
It was Paul and Justin.

30:40.606 --> 30:44.443
But you wish it was you,
don't you?

30:44.476 --> 30:47.914
I think we're done here.

30:47.947 --> 30:49.348
MEGAN:
His lawyer's right, you know?

30:49.381 --> 30:50.482
The gun we found on him

30:50.516 --> 30:52.351
isn't a match
for our missing weapon.

30:52.384 --> 30:54.353
COLBY:
You're not going
to like this much, either.

30:54.386 --> 30:56.588
His e-mail story
holds up.

30:56.622 --> 30:59.258
That warning that was sent out
to the other DMG members?

30:59.291 --> 31:00.192
It was sent from his account,

31:00.226 --> 31:02.661
but it originated
from the school library.

31:02.694 --> 31:04.063
So he sent it from the school.

31:04.096 --> 31:06.032
Not unless he was in two places
at once.

31:06.065 --> 31:09.368
His school I.D. badge says
he cut out early that day.

31:09.401 --> 31:10.302
His ATM card

31:10.336 --> 31:13.039
and a security cam
photo says he was making

31:13.072 --> 31:15.074
a withdrawal
the same time
the e-mail was sent.

31:15.107 --> 31:16.475
He created the game,
he's the leader.

31:16.508 --> 31:17.576
All this goes down

31:17.609 --> 31:19.311
and he's got nothing
to do with it?

31:19.345 --> 31:21.580
I don't buy that.

31:23.482 --> 31:26.452
( knocking )

31:26.485 --> 31:29.455
Charlie, your advice--
"Free your molecules"?

31:29.488 --> 31:31.323
I made a reservation

31:31.357 --> 31:33.525
for Megan and I
at an Ethiopian restaurant.

31:33.559 --> 31:35.527
Ethiopian,
on Fairfax.

31:35.561 --> 31:36.595
Thinking outside
the box.

31:36.628 --> 31:38.064
Wish me well.

31:38.097 --> 31:41.500
Hey, you know, um,
you were right.

31:41.533 --> 31:43.669
Shooter number three's route
doesn't conform

31:43.702 --> 31:46.338
to any predictable
pursuit-evasion result.

31:46.372 --> 31:48.340
I'm thinking
that I must be missing

31:48.374 --> 31:50.376
a variable.

31:56.582 --> 31:59.118
Up until now--
I got to be honest--

31:59.151 --> 32:01.053
I think we've been looking
at this school shooting

32:01.087 --> 32:02.054
the wrong way.

32:02.088 --> 32:04.490
Let's take a look
at the route

32:04.523 --> 32:06.158
taken by our first
two shooters.

32:06.192 --> 32:08.027
Their movement is methodical.

32:08.060 --> 32:11.663
They are pursuing students in
a logical progression.

32:11.697 --> 32:14.133
Now let's take a look
at our third shooter.

32:15.701 --> 32:17.503
Appears here

32:17.536 --> 32:20.006
and for the next minute
makes his way through the school

32:20.039 --> 32:22.541
killing victims
until vanishing here.

32:22.574 --> 32:24.110
Most likely changed clothes.

32:24.143 --> 32:26.578
Shooter number three's route
is circuitous.

32:26.612 --> 32:28.580
It's inefficient.

32:28.614 --> 32:30.416
Yeah, but it's a random
shooting spree.

32:30.449 --> 32:32.384
Doesn't it make sense
that he'd choose a random path?

32:32.418 --> 32:36.288
Intuitively, yes, but, well,
mathematically, no.

32:36.322 --> 32:40.592
Mathematicians apply
a path minimization
to analyze

32:40.626 --> 32:42.394
this kind of
predator-prey dynamic.

32:42.428 --> 32:44.330
What exactly is that?

32:44.363 --> 32:46.632
The snake pursues the mouse.

32:46.665 --> 32:49.535
Mouse runs,
the snake is relentless

32:49.568 --> 32:51.403
and tracks every step.

32:51.437 --> 32:52.671
And when it runs into
obstacles,

32:52.704 --> 32:55.674
it finds the quickest, most
economical way around them.

32:55.707 --> 32:59.345
Now using path minimization,
we can predict the snake's path

32:59.378 --> 33:01.413
because the snake only has
one thing on its mind--

33:01.447 --> 33:04.516
finding the most efficient
point A to point B

33:04.550 --> 33:06.218
between it and its dinner.

33:06.252 --> 33:08.687
So shooter number three
is just a lousy snake,

33:08.720 --> 33:10.522
or what?
Shooter number three's

33:10.556 --> 33:12.624
route was definitely not
determined by path minimization.

33:12.658 --> 33:14.493
So... what then?

33:15.494 --> 33:18.530
Maybe this.

33:18.564 --> 33:21.767
Now we know that the school
uses RFID chip technology

33:21.800 --> 33:23.135
to take attendance;

33:23.169 --> 33:25.537
tells teachers when
students are in class

33:25.571 --> 33:27.173
and when they're absent.

33:27.206 --> 33:30.342
Keeps track of students
using a PDA.

33:30.376 --> 33:32.644
Right. Names and locations
of the students

33:32.678 --> 33:34.246
show up on the screen.

33:34.280 --> 33:36.048
The DMG kids, we know
they have the capability

33:36.082 --> 33:37.416
to break into
the school security system.

33:37.449 --> 33:39.818
Yeah, so why couldn't they
hack into the RFID?

33:39.851 --> 33:41.553
They definitely weren't
taking attendance.

33:41.587 --> 33:43.622
Charlie's right.

33:43.655 --> 33:47.526
Can you bring up the model
for shooter number three?

33:47.559 --> 33:51.063
Look at the behavior
in the model.

33:51.097 --> 33:52.798
DAVID:
He's letting the students
go right by him

33:52.831 --> 33:54.600
without even taking a shot.

33:54.633 --> 33:57.303
Because he's targeting
specific students--

33:57.336 --> 33:58.604
the quarterback,
the skateboarder

33:58.637 --> 34:00.606
and the swim team captain.

34:00.639 --> 34:02.241
And the system would tell him
exactly where they are.

34:07.779 --> 34:09.815
LARRY:
Oh, that... no,
that's sufficient.

34:09.848 --> 34:11.817
( African music playing )
Thank you.

34:11.850 --> 34:15.687
So the last time
I had Ethiopian food

34:15.721 --> 34:18.357
I was at a conference
on Bondi Accretion

34:18.390 --> 34:19.791
in Addis Ababa.
( laughs )

34:19.825 --> 34:20.826
What?

34:20.859 --> 34:22.694
Oh, am I being tedious?

34:22.728 --> 34:26.298
No, no, tedious would be
a week at Quantico

34:26.332 --> 34:30.669
studying note-taking skills
at a crime scene.

34:30.702 --> 34:32.871
Oh, speaking of which,
I heard you and Charlie

34:32.904 --> 34:34.206
went down to the school.

34:34.240 --> 34:35.874
Yeah.

34:35.907 --> 34:37.676
It was horrific.

34:37.709 --> 34:39.711
I just kept thinking
all the while, you know,

34:39.745 --> 34:41.147
if I could only
corral a wormhole

34:41.180 --> 34:43.715
and go back in time,

34:43.749 --> 34:46.452
just talk to these young men
before they did it.

34:46.485 --> 34:48.254
And what would you say to them?

34:48.287 --> 34:51.290
I would say high school
is ephemeral.

34:51.323 --> 34:53.725
And I don't know if the meek
inherit the Earth,

34:53.759 --> 34:55.694
but Bill Gates
and the Google guys...

34:55.727 --> 34:56.695
you know, they did all right.

34:56.728 --> 34:59.131
You seem to have done well.

34:59.165 --> 35:00.466
No.

35:00.499 --> 35:02.634
Well, now, but
in high school?

35:02.668 --> 35:04.236
Oh, I don't think you and I
would've been

35:04.270 --> 35:05.671
at the same table.

35:05.704 --> 35:06.672
In fact,

35:06.705 --> 35:09.475
I wasn't permitted a table.

35:09.508 --> 35:12.411
I was kind of a mess
in high school.

35:12.444 --> 35:13.879
Yeah?

35:13.912 --> 35:15.314
That surprises me.

35:15.347 --> 35:17.783
It was a surprise
to most people,

35:17.816 --> 35:20.686
particularly my parents
who could, you know,

35:20.719 --> 35:22.788
barely show their face
at the country club for a while.

35:22.821 --> 35:26.158
Oh, no, country club.
You're one of those.

35:26.192 --> 35:29.428
Social register, too.

35:29.461 --> 35:31.697
You're full of surprises,
you know that.

35:31.730 --> 35:33.465
So this FBI thing,

35:33.499 --> 35:35.801
why did you become a G man?

35:37.703 --> 35:40.639
Well, it's a little more
complicated,

35:40.672 --> 35:42.741
but I have three older sisters,

35:42.774 --> 35:46.812
and I was my father's
last chance at having a son.

35:46.845 --> 35:49.648
I could play every ball game
known to man.

35:49.681 --> 35:53.719
As I got older, it just got
harder to switch gears.

35:53.752 --> 35:55.721
In fairness,
I should say that

35:55.754 --> 35:58.757
the FBI has given me the
greatest sense of equilibrium

35:58.790 --> 36:02.228
I've ever felt... on most days.

36:02.261 --> 36:05.731
You do seem
a little distracted tonight.

36:05.764 --> 36:07.766
It's just the case.

36:07.799 --> 36:09.268
You know, Charlie's math

36:09.301 --> 36:11.570
shows that our
main suspect fits

36:11.603 --> 36:13.472
the shooter profile
for a school shooting.

36:13.505 --> 36:15.574
But his math also shows us

36:15.607 --> 36:17.776
that our shooter
number three

36:17.809 --> 36:20.212
wasn't on a killing rampage.

36:20.246 --> 36:22.748
You know, I'm failing to see
the inconsistency.

36:22.781 --> 36:24.250
The first two shooters

36:24.283 --> 36:25.784
fit the profile
of a school shooter.

36:25.817 --> 36:28.387
They show unbridled rage.

36:28.420 --> 36:30.689
This third shooter...

36:30.722 --> 36:32.524
was calculated.

36:32.558 --> 36:34.760
It was a planned attack.

36:34.793 --> 36:37.363
It's indicative of
a whole other motive.

36:37.396 --> 36:40.299
You know, in cosmology,

36:40.332 --> 36:42.801
when faced with logical
inconsistencies,

36:42.834 --> 36:45.003
I like to fall back
on an old chestnut:

36:45.036 --> 36:49.808
if you don't like the answer,
ask a different question.

36:52.711 --> 36:54.780
DON:
6:00 a.m. I get
a call from Charlie

36:54.813 --> 36:56.682
saying we got some
new angle on the case.

36:56.715 --> 36:57.849
It was something
that Larry

36:57.883 --> 36:59.918
said to me over dinner
last night.

36:59.951 --> 37:03.289
Wait, wait, you and Larry
had dinner last night?

37:03.322 --> 37:04.790
Oh, God.
Moving on.

37:04.823 --> 37:05.991
He just got me thinking.

37:06.024 --> 37:07.559
You and I both have
our doubts

37:07.593 --> 37:08.760
that Dietrich
is the third shooter.

37:08.794 --> 37:09.728
Right.

37:09.761 --> 37:12.264
So what if we need
to look at this in reverse?

37:12.298 --> 37:14.466
What if we need to study
the victimology?

37:14.500 --> 37:16.502
Shooter number three
picked all of his targets

37:16.535 --> 37:17.769
for a specific reason.

37:17.803 --> 37:20.639
There has to be
a reason why.
Oh, I see.

37:20.672 --> 37:21.673
So, what, just have Charlie
do what he was doing

37:21.707 --> 37:23.542
with the suspects,
but do it with the victims?

37:23.575 --> 37:25.544
Yeah. If we can find
the common denominator

37:25.577 --> 37:27.479
it might take us back
to the killer.

37:27.513 --> 37:29.715
All right, that's good.

37:29.748 --> 37:31.717
Where'd you have dinner?

37:31.750 --> 37:33.819
So I ran a cluster analysis

37:33.852 --> 37:36.054
on the student files
of our three victims--

37:36.087 --> 37:37.889
Rob Holt, skateboard dude;

37:37.923 --> 37:39.725
Thomas Caballo, quarterback;

37:39.758 --> 37:42.027
and Louis Ives,
swim team captain.

37:42.060 --> 37:44.296
The two jocks share
numerous commonalities--

37:44.330 --> 37:45.464
they're both seniors,

37:45.497 --> 37:47.366
both captains of their squad.

37:47.399 --> 37:48.900
What about
skateboard dude?

37:48.934 --> 37:50.769
His only commonality
is that his name appeared

37:50.802 --> 37:54.406
in an investigation of steroid
abuse by student athletes.

37:54.440 --> 37:55.907
He was a suspected supplier.

37:55.941 --> 37:57.409
Some of the students
mentioned that.

37:57.443 --> 37:59.745
The school investigated,
but nothing came of it.

37:59.778 --> 38:01.813
Any other correlations?

38:01.847 --> 38:04.383
All three names appeared in
a police report

38:04.416 --> 38:05.884
of a keg party that got so rowdy

38:05.917 --> 38:07.353
the neighbors
complained.

38:07.386 --> 38:08.987
However, there were
a dozen students

38:09.020 --> 38:11.056
on that report. None of them
were victims, none of them

38:11.089 --> 38:13.659
had any apparent relationship
to the victims.
Yeah, but still,

38:13.692 --> 38:14.960
maybe something happened
at the party.

38:14.993 --> 38:17.095
Yeah, something enough
to motivate a killer.

38:17.128 --> 38:18.797
You got a list of kids
at the party?

38:18.830 --> 38:20.666
Can you put it up?
Yeah.

38:21.867 --> 38:24.670
We just need to find the
connection between these names

38:24.703 --> 38:25.971
and one of the DMG kids.

38:26.004 --> 38:27.939
Karen Camden.

38:27.973 --> 38:29.808
Wait a minute, she was
on the police report?

38:29.841 --> 38:33.712
She has a connection
to all the DMG kids.

38:33.745 --> 38:35.681
Yeah, she wrote a story about
them for the school paper.

38:35.714 --> 38:36.682
She knows them really well.

38:36.715 --> 38:38.884
She knows they were having
violent fantasies.

38:38.917 --> 38:41.387
Yeah, but why would she want
to take part in this attack?

38:41.420 --> 38:43.822
I don't know, but
it might explain why

38:43.855 --> 38:46.725
they spared her, not just
because she gave them props

38:46.758 --> 38:47.826
in the school
newspaper.

38:47.859 --> 38:48.994
Absolutely.
Maybe she's in on it.

38:55.667 --> 38:57.102
MEGAN:
Karen Camden purchased

38:57.135 --> 38:59.037
a WIFI PDA
three weeks ago.

38:59.070 --> 39:00.539
Okay, so that would allow her

39:00.572 --> 39:02.474
to track anyone
in school, right?

39:02.508 --> 39:03.909
Her credit card showed
a bunch of charges

39:03.942 --> 39:05.711
to a motel in the Valley.

39:05.744 --> 39:07.746
The manager ID'd her
and Justin Price.

39:07.779 --> 39:08.780
Oh, a pretty girl

39:08.814 --> 39:11.483
could get a teenage boy
to do a lot of things.

39:11.517 --> 39:13.785
Especially if he's not
used to the attention.

39:13.819 --> 39:15.020
And if he has the inclination.

39:15.053 --> 39:15.954
Look at Pamela Smart,

39:15.987 --> 39:17.823
she got one to kill
her husband for her.

39:17.856 --> 39:21.026
So what, she seduces Price,
uses him and blows him off?

39:21.059 --> 39:22.160
She could've even gotten him

39:22.193 --> 39:24.496
to shoot Paul Elins,
his own friend.

39:24.530 --> 39:26.865
She could've made up
the whole murder-suicide pact.

39:26.898 --> 39:28.967
Probably knew he was fantasizing
about the shootings

39:29.000 --> 39:30.802
and then just pushed him
over the edge--

39:30.836 --> 39:32.137
and becomes
the third shooter.

39:32.170 --> 39:33.605
Why?
What's the motive?

39:33.639 --> 39:35.874
Well, best guess,
we look at the victims.

39:35.907 --> 39:37.142
The answer's probably
going to lay there.

39:37.175 --> 39:39.010
School steroid scandal.

39:39.044 --> 39:41.179
Article was written
by Karen Camden.

39:41.212 --> 39:43.148
I thought that
investigation went nowhere.

39:43.181 --> 39:45.651
No prosecutions, but
some of the team captains

39:45.684 --> 39:47.586
lost their college scholarships.

39:47.619 --> 39:49.621
Yeah?
Just to get even, huh?

39:50.889 --> 39:52.991
Karen's not a violent person.

39:53.024 --> 39:54.893
She'd never do
anything like this.

39:54.926 --> 39:57.162
Yeah, but something happened
at that party, didn't it?

39:57.195 --> 39:59.431
Something that changed
your daughter.

39:59.465 --> 40:00.799
Mrs. Camden,

40:00.832 --> 40:02.868
we have eight people dead
and 12 more

40:02.901 --> 40:04.570
in the hospital.
If you know the reason

40:04.603 --> 40:07.806
for this,
we need you to speak.

40:07.839 --> 40:09.641
They raped me.

40:13.979 --> 40:16.815
Becky was the one who set it up.

40:16.848 --> 40:17.983
She invited me

40:18.016 --> 40:19.785
to that party.

40:19.818 --> 40:21.687
Helped Rob Holt,

40:21.720 --> 40:23.822
Mr. Skateboard Cool,
slip something into my drink.

40:25.691 --> 40:28.794
Then Jake Porter raped me
and the others watched

40:28.827 --> 40:29.828
and took pictures.

40:29.861 --> 40:33.064
Oh, God, Karen.
God, honey.
I wrote that story

40:33.098 --> 40:36.067
about the steroids.

40:36.101 --> 40:39.838
They blamed me for messing up
their scholarships.

40:39.871 --> 40:41.907
Why didn't you press charges?

40:41.940 --> 40:44.042
They were the stars
of the school.

40:45.811 --> 40:47.913
It would be my word
against theirs.

40:47.946 --> 40:49.147
They had to pay.

40:49.180 --> 40:51.850
Karen, eight people are dead

40:51.883 --> 40:53.852
that you went to school
with every day.

40:53.885 --> 40:56.454
I'm going to need
you to put your hands
behind your back.

40:58.089 --> 40:59.691
( handcuffs click )

41:00.692 --> 41:02.894
I'm sorry, Mom.
I'm sorry.

41:02.928 --> 41:04.963
I'm sorry.

41:11.703 --> 41:12.804
DAVID:
Jake Porter.

41:12.838 --> 41:13.972
Yeah?

41:14.005 --> 41:15.707
Take your headgear off,
tough guy.

41:15.741 --> 41:16.975
We want to talk to you.

41:17.008 --> 41:19.077
What's this about?

41:19.110 --> 41:22.781
You're under arrest for the rape
of Karen Camden.

41:22.814 --> 41:23.982
What are you talking about?

41:24.015 --> 41:25.150
MEGAN:
We spoke to Karen.

41:25.183 --> 41:27.719
She gave us a statement about
what happened at the party.

41:27.753 --> 41:29.788
You're talking about the same
girl who shot up the school

41:29.821 --> 41:31.957
with her psycho-geek pals,
right?

41:31.990 --> 41:33.992
Everybody's talking
about how she's the

41:34.025 --> 41:36.628
one who engineered
the whole thing.

41:36.662 --> 41:38.730
You're telling me you
believe Karen Camden?

41:38.764 --> 41:40.899
The girl's
a whack job.

41:40.932 --> 41:42.868
It'll be my word against hers.

41:42.901 --> 41:44.235
MEGAN:
Yeah, would've been.

41:44.269 --> 41:46.772
Except for Rob Holt's
cell phone.

41:46.805 --> 41:47.939
Your moron friend

41:47.973 --> 41:50.241
took a picture of you
with his phone.

41:50.275 --> 41:51.877
DAVID:
Let's go.

41:51.910 --> 41:53.612
Turn around.

41:53.645 --> 41:55.781
I'm not going anywhere
with you guys.

41:55.814 --> 41:56.948
Yeah, you are.
You're coming with us.

41:56.982 --> 41:59.050
Get off me.

42:01.653 --> 42:02.721
What is it

42:02.754 --> 42:03.955
with guys and dirty pictures?

42:05.757 --> 42:06.925
Stand up.

42:12.898 --> 42:14.566
CHARLIE:
Where's Big Papa?

42:14.600 --> 42:15.967
The caterer.

42:16.001 --> 42:18.003
Ah, getting serious.

42:18.036 --> 42:21.573
I just think he doesn't want
to have to cook, you know?

42:21.607 --> 42:23.041
CHARLIE:
You never get enough?

42:23.074 --> 42:24.676
DON:
Look, what do you want
from me?

42:24.710 --> 42:27.045
I like seeing how they spin it,
you know?

42:27.078 --> 42:31.683
You think anybody really knows
how any of this stuff happens?

42:31.717 --> 42:34.052
Definitely not.

42:34.085 --> 42:36.121
I know that when I was

42:36.154 --> 42:37.989
in high school,
I was so...

42:38.023 --> 42:40.358
uh, angst-ridden.

42:40.391 --> 42:42.060
Yeah.
But I mean,

42:42.093 --> 42:43.028
you didn't shoot anybody.

42:43.061 --> 42:45.831
No, but there were days
when I wanted to do,

42:45.864 --> 42:50.301
you know, real...
real damage to...

42:50.335 --> 42:52.037
to you.

42:52.070 --> 42:53.004
To me?

42:54.105 --> 42:56.041
Hey, buddy, take your best shot.

42:56.074 --> 42:58.944
Come on.

42:58.977 --> 43:01.079
Wait, I'll help you out,
I'll get on my knees.

43:01.112 --> 43:03.181
Come on.
I'm not a
kid anymore.
All right.

43:03.214 --> 43:05.050
Tough guy, let's go.
Maybe we should step outside.

43:05.083 --> 43:07.185
All right.
How about now?
How about now?
Let's go.

43:07.218 --> 43:08.319
Come on.

43:08.353 --> 43:10.388
You ain't got nothing.

43:10.421 --> 43:12.624
All right, all right.
How about we just get pizza?

43:12.658 --> 43:15.026
No, I don't want to go out,
man, I just got home.

43:15.060 --> 43:16.995
There's a lovely pot roast
in the fridge.

43:17.028 --> 43:18.029
It's a week old.
Come on.

43:18.063 --> 43:19.097
How do you know that?

43:19.130 --> 43:20.098
Of course.

43:20.131 --> 43:21.733
You eat here more than I do.

43:21.767 --> 43:22.934
I'll pay, how's that?
