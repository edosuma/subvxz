They got a website
as well, ain't they?

you call Daddy, all right?

-Yes.
-Big Daddy Grindah. Sweet!

don't care what age they are,
they'll get crushed.

Wait, wait, wait. No, no.

All right, I'm leaving it
with you. Get it sorted.

02:07.320 --> 02:11.280
I'll have a look at it tonight.
I chucked some towels
down to soak the water up.

02:11.320 --> 02:14.160
-What water?
-Catch you on the flip side,
yeah?

02:25.560 --> 02:28.800
Mate, the internet
is gonna be big, like.

02:28.840 --> 02:33.960
Grindah only started believing
in the internet when it had
all the pornos on his.

02:34.000 --> 02:36.480
I thought it's gotta be good
if it's got that.

02:36.520 --> 02:40.440
I said it to Decoy, like,
we might have to get
a bigger studio, innit?

02:40.480 --> 02:43.440
-Yeah. Just to deal with
all the emails and that.
-Yeah, exactly.

02:43.480 --> 02:45.520
Probably get wifi.

we've bought the website,

02:56.280 --> 02:59.960
-but it comes blank, so...
-Yeah, you've got to build
it yourself.

03:00.000 --> 03:02.760
-Sort of like Ikea.
-Yeah, yeah.

03:02.800 --> 03:05.640
Listen, boys, don't worry, yeah?
Once I get his up and running,

03:05.680 --> 03:08.680
you'll be bigger than two
girls and one bloody bucket.

03:08.720 --> 03:11.120
-You seen that?
-It's disgusting.
I showed it to Aldona.

03:11.160 --> 03:13.080
She said she was
gonna leave me.

03:13.120 --> 03:15.120
-Serious, she's leaving you?
-No, mate.

03:15.160 --> 03:18.560

I do all her paperwork and that.

03:22.920 --> 03:25.000
Yeah. Still DJ-ing.

03:25.040 --> 03:28.440
Website's not even up.
Bookings are rolling in.

03:28.480 --> 03:31.760
Hold on. Wait there
one second, mate.

03:31.800 --> 03:35.760
You know Gary and Lisa, yeah?
They're having a wedding party.

03:35.800 --> 03:40.120
Their DJ dropped out.
It's down the social club.
Couple of hours.

03:40.160 --> 03:43.240
Nah. We don't do weddings.

03:43.280 --> 03:45.920
-It's £200 though.
-£200?

03:45.960 --> 03:48.280
-Yeah.
-So that's...

03:48.320 --> 03:51.360
Between us that'll be...
two, three.

03:51.400 --> 03:54.960
-That'll probably be all right.
-One thing though is...

03:55.000 --> 03:57.720
Cos it's a wedding, they don't
want any MCs just a DJ.

03:57.760 --> 04:00.560
Obviously not then
if there's no MCs.

04:00.600 --> 04:03.800
The DJ-MC dynamic's pretty
unique, actually.

04:03.840 --> 04:06.960
It like some Darren Brown
sort of shit.

04:07.000 --> 04:09.800

what I'm gonna play

04:09.840 --> 04:12.200
even before I've played it,
sometimes.

04:12.240 --> 04:14.640
Bit of a sixth sense of mine,
innit?

04:14.680 --> 04:18.519
Also I pick out our set as well,
so that helps a bit.

04:18.560 --> 04:22.480
Yeah. We both bring something
to the table, though.

04:22.520 --> 04:25.240
-Turntable?
-Aaah!

04:25.280 --> 04:28.560
What about your music? Are you
going to stream that via
internets and that?

04:28.600 --> 04:33.960
Mate, we're not an "internet
radio station". We're
very much FM-based.

04:34.000 --> 04:36.800
-We're just luring them in.
-We're going global, but...

04:36.840 --> 04:41.280
you will very much need to be
in Brentford to be able
to catch Kurupt FM.

04:41.320 --> 04:47.080
We're like a global, local
pirate radio station
sort of thing.

04:47.120 --> 04:49.720
Probably one of the first,
actually.

04:49.760 --> 04:52.400
Radio will never be defeated
by the internet,

04:52.440 --> 04:54.520
cos radio will never die, yeah?

04:54.560 --> 04:57.360
In apocalypse films, yeah,
at the end of it,

04:57.400 --> 04:59.720
they're all running around,
there's no internet working.

04:59.760 --> 05:01.880
What are they doing?
They're checking the radio.

05:01.920 --> 05:05.000
What are they searching for?
Messages.

05:05.040 --> 05:08.520
What will be on in
the apocalypse? Kurupt FM.

05:08.560 --> 05:12.680
Yeah, so the digital proxy
server, straight away
that's 15 quid.

05:12.720 --> 05:16.680
You gonna need the Intel inside.
You gonna need the Intel
outside.

05:16.720 --> 05:20.800
I could do it for you for around
one-seven-zero, mate. 170.

05:20.840 --> 05:22.920
We will need Intel, so...

05:22.960 --> 05:25.920
With a bit of Pentium
in there. Right.

05:25.960 --> 05:28.360
Sling the VAT off and
we'll call it quits.

05:28.400 --> 05:30.320
-Okay, 165.
-Deal.

05:38.040 --> 05:40.080
That's nice.

05:40.120 --> 05:43.280
There's actually, like,
a 98p shop up the road.

05:43.320 --> 05:47.680
I think here you get a better
overall quality of product.

05:47.720 --> 05:50.960
[director] How do you find
Angel going to school?

05:51.000 --> 05:53.840
[Grindah] She's still
struggling a little bit.

05:53.880 --> 05:58.640
No, I'm not. I'm not struggling.
I just think it's unfair
to force people to do stuff.

05:58.680 --> 06:02.520
There should be an alternative.
Like, grown-ups have the dole,

06:02.560 --> 06:06.360
so why isn't there something
they could get paid for
instead of going to school?

06:06.400 --> 06:11.640
[Grindah] She does need her own
mates. She can't hang around
with us her whole life.

06:11.680 --> 06:15.040
My mum's still my best friend.

06:15.080 --> 06:19.600
Girls her age are all like
two-faced bitches anyway. I told
her to stay away from them.

06:19.640 --> 06:22.840
[director] So what's good
about Angel being at school?

06:22.880 --> 06:26.640
<i>It means I've got more time
to organise the house or
whatever.</i>

06:26.680 --> 06:31.200
Just so many different boxes.
Could you just imagine
how tidy the house could be?

06:33.560 --> 06:36.680
This one's got like
a glittery texture top,

06:36.720 --> 06:39.440
so that's just a bit more
like elegant sort of style.

06:39.480 --> 06:43.840
And these ones are like
amazing value, cos you've got
all those little ones in there.

06:43.880 --> 06:47.680
Just get a few more
of these. They'll be
good for Grindah's lunches.

06:48.640 --> 06:50.480
All right, boys.

06:50.520 --> 06:54.240
How are we gonna get
that money to pay Chabuds?

06:54.280 --> 06:57.600
Do you reckon we'll do
that wedding later, bruv?

06:57.640 --> 06:59.880
Nah, I already said
we ain't doing it.

07:02.960 --> 07:06.240
We're just gonna blaze
this zoot and pick up Angel.

07:09.120 --> 07:11.280

right?

07:13.680 --> 07:16.440
Daddy's got to get
on one, like. Easy.

07:16.480 --> 07:19.320
I can't stay for long.
Got the whole of
the internet to sort out.

07:19.360 --> 07:21.080
Why's the door not... What?

07:21.120 --> 07:23.320
Why's my leather bean bag
over there?

07:23.360 --> 07:25.840
-I was just having a sort out--
-I don't like it like this.

07:25.880 --> 07:28.200
Hello, baby!
Are you all right?

07:28.240 --> 07:30.920
Are you exhausted?
You look so tired.

07:30.960 --> 07:34.440
-What you doing to her?
-I'm checking for bruises.

07:34.480 --> 07:37.280
Such a freak.
See you lot in a bit.

07:37.320 --> 07:40.080
Does it hurt?
Does it hurt if I do that?

07:40.120 --> 07:42.040
-No.
-No? Okay.

07:42.080 --> 07:45.520
[director] Do you find it
hard caring for a family?

07:45.560 --> 07:48.960
It's hard but it's extremely
rewarding when you see the
smile on Craig's face

07:49.000 --> 07:52.320
when the heating's on, the
electricity's pumping
through the house,

07:52.360 --> 07:57.480
the computer's on, like.
That's a sense of achievement.

07:57.520 --> 08:01.560
I haven't actually paid the
bills yet, but when I do, I
will feel definitely achieved.

08:01.600 --> 08:03.760
Craigie G.

08:03.800 --> 08:06.480
What's going on, man?

08:06.520 --> 08:10.640
Do you want to help me
do that washing machine?

08:10.680 --> 08:14.720
Nah, Mum said you have
to buy a new one. I'm busy.

08:14.760 --> 08:17.680
Is it? Uh...

08:17.720 --> 08:20.080
Probably got homework
to do or something.

08:22.400 --> 08:25.320
It just would have been nice
to have a little...

08:25.360 --> 08:29.160
father to, sort of guardian,
son moment.

08:32.200 --> 08:33.760
-Easy, boys.
-Chabsie!

08:33.799 --> 08:35.400
Nice Gucci, my nigga. Come in.

08:35.440 --> 08:37.960

08:38.000 --> 08:40.240
The big unveiling, yeah?

08:40.280 --> 08:44.200
So what I've done, I've made
some changes to the plans
you gave me.

08:44.240 --> 08:47.720
Just using my own
internet expertise.

08:47.760 --> 08:52.800
Everybody knows that sex sells,
all right? Trust me. I've bought
it many times myself.

08:52.840 --> 08:56.360
-What have we gotta do?
-No, you don't have to do
anything. Let me show you.

08:56.400 --> 09:00.680
I, basically, took some snaps
of my wife, Aldona,
who's stunning, yeah?

09:00.720 --> 09:03.920
And I've just, basically,
put her on there

09:03.960 --> 09:05.840
and just sexed
it up a little bit.

09:05.880 --> 09:08.360
-That's Aldona, yeah?
-That's her, yeah.

09:08.400 --> 09:12.640
-You can see her wild bean café.
-No, I mean, technically,
it's not her vagina.

09:12.680 --> 09:15.320
Hers wasn't the best maintained
so I found another one.

09:15.360 --> 09:19.440
Cut and pasted it on, but we
do need to talk about
the payment first.

09:19.480 --> 09:23.080
Yeah, don't worry about the
payment. We've got one of our
best boys on the case, innit?

09:23.120 --> 09:26.160
Trust me, on some <i> Ocean's</i>
<i>11-type</i> espionage shit.

09:26.200 --> 09:30.000
Down the JC right now, telling
them that his nan's flat's
flooded, like.

09:32.080 --> 09:34.760
<i>[Steves] You can get this thing
called a crisis loan, yeah,</i>

09:34.800 --> 09:37.840
<i>if you look like you're
having a crisis, basically.</i>

09:37.880 --> 09:41.720
<i>Normally, I don't bother,
cos they ask questions
and it's quite intense.</i>

09:41.760 --> 09:46.480
<i>I usually do the standard
diary thing, where you tell
them what you've been doing.</i>

09:46.520 --> 09:50.320
And they just give you
free money, basically.

09:50.360 --> 09:52.840
I got a free laptop as well,

09:52.880 --> 09:56.600
cos I gave myself dyslexia
from smoking skunk, so...

09:59.000 --> 10:02.000
-Hello.
-Hello. My name's Steven Green.

10:02.040 --> 10:05.040
-I've had a crisis.
-[inaudible]

10:05.080 --> 10:09.920
-[woman] So why do you
need the crisis loan?
-Eh?

10:09.960 --> 10:13.240
Just a pipe burst.

10:13.280 --> 10:16.280
And I was in there as well.

10:16.320 --> 10:18.600
Cos that's why I wet myself.

10:18.640 --> 10:22.120
Not with the trousers,
with the water.

10:22.160 --> 10:26.320
Oh, Mr Green, we can only give
out these loans to people

10:26.360 --> 10:30.200
who have a genuine emergency.
People who have gone
through an ordeal.

10:30.240 --> 10:33.560
-Do you understand?
-Yeah... Yea...

10:33.600 --> 10:35.600
Um...

10:35.640 --> 10:38.320
Cos I've done that as well.

10:38.360 --> 10:41.360
-Mm-hmm.
-I've got more crises.

10:41.400 --> 10:45.440
Cos it so cold out, I can't
really think. My brain's
a little bit, like...

10:45.480 --> 10:48.000
Yes, I understand.

10:48.040 --> 10:50.360
[Beats] Kurupt FM does cost
a lot of money to run,

10:50.400 --> 10:54.400
cos everyone here, bar Grindah,
has to pay subs.

10:54.440 --> 10:57.320
Cos what it is,
is promotion for yourself.

10:57.360 --> 11:00.640
Promotion for yourself.
You pay me a sub to be
able to promote yourself.

11:00.680 --> 11:04.720
I've got a tab though. I'm
heavily in debt to these lot.

11:04.760 --> 11:07.960
-But it's worth it in the end.
-But we let him sleep
on our floor.

11:08.000 --> 11:10.880
So he saves money on rent
as well.

11:10.920 --> 11:13.000
But it is my nan's flat,
originally.

11:13.040 --> 11:15.440
Doesn't matter, Steves.
She's dead. Forget about her.

11:15.480 --> 11:17.520
-She's not dead. She moved out.
-Move on.

11:17.560 --> 11:19.920
Whatever then. She's dead to us.

11:19.960 --> 11:24.760
They were like, "Just give me
all your money," like.

11:24.800 --> 11:27.720
"Give me all your stuff," like.
Literally...

11:27.760 --> 11:31.000
When I got home, the pipes
had burst as well, so...

11:31.040 --> 11:33.960
And that is a...?

11:34.000 --> 11:37.400
Yeah, it's...a gun.

11:37.440 --> 11:42.400
-Right. Well...
-Can I get the money now?

11:42.440 --> 11:46.720
I assume you'll be happy to tell
the story to the authorities?

11:46.760 --> 11:49.760
Yeah. What authorities?

11:49.800 --> 11:52.320
I'm talking about the police.

11:54.440 --> 11:56.280
-Yeah?
-A-huh.

12:00.320 --> 12:02.520
Ah! I think I heard...

12:02.560 --> 12:05.920
I'll just chat to
the person in reception.

12:05.960 --> 12:08.760
I'll ring them off my phone,
cos you lot don't have to...

12:13.440 --> 12:17.320
Going global's, uh...
it's an art form, innit?

12:17.360 --> 12:20.400
So we're just starting
the global push now.

12:20.440 --> 12:22.920
I don't know how Roche
will take to that, actually.

12:22.960 --> 12:26.200
The stress levels are
probably gonna rocket.

12:26.240 --> 12:29.920
But once I get the money
then it will be fine,
once we've got the millions.

12:29.960 --> 12:31.560
<i>No sweat!</i>

12:31.600 --> 12:32.880
-Roche!
-Yeah.

12:32.920 --> 12:35.080
There you go, I've done it.

12:35.120 --> 12:37.360
What about them screws
on the floor?

12:37.400 --> 12:39.520
Don't need screws.

12:39.560 --> 12:41.760
-No More Nails.
-What, you've glued it?

12:41.800 --> 12:44.640
Cos I was hoping we could keep
the open/close mechanism
of the door.

12:44.680 --> 12:46.640
It was one of the things
I liked about it.

12:46.680 --> 12:49.440
All still fully functional,
as well.

12:51.640 --> 12:53.120
Well...

12:54.760 --> 12:57.240
Yeah, definitely gone.

12:57.280 --> 13:01.800
-What you looking at
on a new door, anyway?
-£90.

13:03.680 --> 13:07.120
I think there's a screwdriver
under there, actually.

13:07.160 --> 13:10.080
-£90, eh?
-Yeah, these things
all cost money!

13:10.120 --> 13:12.760
The washing powder costs money.

13:12.800 --> 13:17.040
Your favourite fucking
super-snuggly fabric softener,
that costs money as well.

13:17.080 --> 13:19.600
Oh, I need that, Roche,
otherwise I get itchy collars.

13:19.640 --> 13:23.600
Oh, get it sorted! I don't
care how you do it,
just fucking do it!

13:25.680 --> 13:28.480
[Roche] What do I love about
Kevin? Do you know what?

13:28.520 --> 13:32.320
I think it is just
his simplicity
and he's really funny.

13:32.360 --> 13:36.040
You know, like,
from time to time...

13:36.080 --> 13:38.640
That's a big one.

13:38.680 --> 13:42.240
..you know, Kevin could do
so many things

13:42.280 --> 13:45.840
if he just put his mind to it.
If he was twatting about with,

13:45.880 --> 13:48.280
you know, Grindah,

13:48.320 --> 13:51.000
which I doubt
is his real name!

13:51.040 --> 13:52.880
[Beats] Clash of egos, I reckon.

13:52.920 --> 13:55.840
He's quite powerful
and she's quite powerful.

13:55.880 --> 13:57.960
So together...

13:58.000 --> 14:02.080
Like on them documentaries
when the two hippos are
fighting

14:02.120 --> 14:05.600
to be the leader of the land.
It's like that, but it's
not physical.

14:05.640 --> 14:08.560
You not paying us
for this or...?

14:08.600 --> 14:10.880

It's Beats here.

14:16.600 --> 14:19.480
Is the wedding still on?

14:22.040 --> 14:26.320
-Call Steves.
See if he's got the money.
-[phone rings]

<i>Steves, where are you?
Are you back yet?</i>

14:36.240 --> 14:39.280
No, I can't come back, bruv.
I'm hiding. I accidentally
robbed a cardigan.

14:39.320 --> 14:42.200
-What?
<i>-Cardigan, I robbed a cardigan.</i>

14:42.240 --> 14:45.320
<i>-From the Job Centre.</i>
-He's saying he's wearing
a cardigan.

14:45.360 --> 14:50.040
-Feds are after me, bruv.
-And he's hiding from police.

14:50.080 --> 14:53.760
-Why is the police...?
-I don't think he's got
the money either.

14:53.800 --> 14:57.200
Why are the police after you?
Stay hidden!

14:57.240 --> 15:01.200
-No, he cut.
-I knew going global
would be intense.

15:01.240 --> 15:03.440
We're fucked.

15:06.400 --> 15:08.840
We might have to do the wedding.

15:08.880 --> 15:12.440
Fuck it! Call Gaz.
We're doing the wedding.

15:12.480 --> 15:15.160
-Oh...
-No, I insist.
I've changed my mind. Do it!

15:15.200 --> 15:19.160
But I can't, cos earlier
I had a text from Roche.

15:19.200 --> 15:22.680
-I didn't even hear anything.
-No before Steves called.

15:22.720 --> 15:26.720
-What's the problem?
-I've got to babysit Craig.

15:26.760 --> 15:30.440
You've got to babysit Craig?
He doesn't even move.

15:30.480 --> 15:34.000
Yeah, cos of his stomach
disorder, Roche wants me there.

15:34.040 --> 15:36.640
Do you know what, yeah?
Don't worry, bruv.

15:36.680 --> 15:39.880
Cos I'll just get Steves or
Decoy or someone else
to do it, like,

15:39.920 --> 15:44.280
-if you can't be a man, like.
-What about the MC/DJ dynamic?

15:44.320 --> 15:46.760
-Too late, mate.
-Boys, boys, boys, boys.

15:46.800 --> 15:49.720
-I think there might be
another way.
-Yeah?

15:49.760 --> 15:52.640
-Yeah.
-Let's definitely do
the other way then.

15:52.680 --> 15:56.120
-No. What is the other way?
-Okay. Check it out, yeah?

with weddings and that, do you?

16:23.440 --> 16:26.040
-No.
-No, exactly.

16:28.080 --> 16:31.000

innit?

or anything?
-Yeah.

been putting all different
foods into, like,

16:53.560 --> 16:58.000
these boxes and the food colour
matches the lid colour. So it's
just a little thing I did.

16:58.040 --> 17:00.960
-Just spruce the house up a bit.
-Nice.

Look at them dancing!
This is a great idea.

24:49.920 --> 24:52.400
-What was you worried about?
-Yeah...

24:52.440 --> 24:55.960
It's just to pay for the
equipment. It doesn't even
cover my costs. Cheers, mate.

24:56.000 --> 24:58.920
They're saying
we can't go back in.

24:58.960 --> 25:01.600
Lisa's nan was crying
before I even got there.

25:01.640 --> 25:04.440
They loved it! See that
little kid? He was loving it.

25:04.480 --> 25:07.480
-Still got paid though.
-I was gonna say about the pay.

25:07.520 --> 25:10.200
How much we gotta give Chabuds,
cos I was hoping...

25:10.240 --> 25:13.680
Worry not, worry not. Cos
I unplugged the transmitter.

25:13.720 --> 25:17.640
- Still thinks he done the set.
-I might go back. Get us
back on air, innit?

25:17.680 --> 25:21.600
Yeah, someone should do that.
Sweet! In a bit, yeah. Nice one.

25:21.640 --> 25:24.920
-So do I get to keep the money?
-Yeah, course we can. 100 each.

25:24.960 --> 25:27.640
So...five minutes' work.
That's the beauty of
the game for you.

25:27.680 --> 25:31.040
-Smell it, smell it.
-Ah, smells like...

25:31.080 --> 25:34.200
Real cash. Dirty cash,
but it's not, but...

25:34.240 --> 25:36.320
-That's legit.
-That's legit, actually.

25:36.360 --> 25:38.320
Squat down, get a good shot.

25:39.880 --> 25:43.080
Now you want to dash
it up in the air.

25:43.120 --> 25:46.040
-Don't, cos half of that's mine.
-Just...

25:46.080 --> 25:48.280
Did you get that?

25:48.320 --> 25:50.840
Nice, nice.

25:50.880 --> 25:55.240
-40, 60, 80, a tonne.
-Tonne, yeah. Sweet.

25:55.280 --> 25:58.080
Look at that. That is
proper money that, as well.

25:58.120 --> 26:01.520
That's an honest day's work.
£100, all mine.

26:01.560 --> 26:04.080
I'm a proper man now.
Got responsibilities.

26:04.120 --> 26:08.000
You lot should try that
sort of shit. It's rewarding.
Bless up, yeah?

26:08.040 --> 26:12.640
[drum and bass plays]

26:23.480 --> 26:26.240
There's a oner for
the washing machine there.

26:26.280 --> 26:29.640
Little bit extra. Treat
yourself. Get a little dress.

26:29.680 --> 26:33.480
Or some army shorts or
whatever. I'm gonna shoot up.

26:33.520 --> 26:37.920
Yeah, Craig, give it
half an hour, yeah?

26:42.360 --> 26:44.560
Kurupt FM will never die!

26:44.600 --> 26:47.760
-Yeah? And never will we, like.
-We're like dragons.

26:47.800 --> 26:50.360
Well, no, cos dragons
don't exist.

26:50.400 --> 26:53.080
What other dinosaurs are there?
T-rex.

26:53.120 --> 26:57.080
No. If it's a T-rex, it'd be me,
cos there's only one T-rex.

26:57.120 --> 27:00.480
I'd probably be one of them
long ones with the big necks?

27:00.520 --> 27:02.840
Just gazing across
Jurassic Park.

27:02.880 --> 27:06.400
-Having bare grass, like.
-Doesn't have to be
Jurassic Park.

27:08.240 --> 27:10.000
It's green.

[Beats] <i> When I die, yeah,</i>
<i>I will just be, like,</i>

27:18.280 --> 27:22.280
With one hand on my headphones,
one hand 'pon decks,

27:22.320 --> 27:25.680
staring into the mixer,
just enjoying music.

27:25.720 --> 27:28.240
Like, dying for the cause, like.

27:28.280 --> 27:33.480
When I die, actually, I'll be
in a massive "motsoleum", like,

27:33.520 --> 27:37.640
frozen with a mic in my hand,
mouth open,

27:37.680 --> 27:42.200
cos I was screaming my last
lyrics to my last dying breath.

27:43.720 --> 27:46.760
-Kurupt FM.
-Viva forever.
