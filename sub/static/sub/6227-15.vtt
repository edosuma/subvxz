00:00.876 --> 00:02.128
Previously on Grimm...

00:02.211 --> 00:03.610
You want to tell me
what's going on?

00:03.670 --> 00:04.887
Dixon was meant to die,

00:04.963 --> 00:06.963
and you were meant to kill
the man that killed him.

00:06.965 --> 00:09.593
We could make you the most
powerful man in the city.

00:10.427 --> 00:13.977
Gallagher's
poll numbers are down 25%.

00:14.056 --> 00:15.558
Sean,
we're running out of time.

00:15.724 --> 00:18.102
You need to commit. You're
either in or you're out.

00:18.352 --> 00:19.524
You can win this.

00:20.103 --> 00:21.400
And a whole lot more.

00:33.492 --> 00:36.336
Have you seen this lipstick?
It's all over YouTube.

00:36.954 --> 00:38.956
Glossy lipstick is
all the rage.

00:39.540 --> 00:41.838
Oh, and this mascara
is amazing.

00:42.459 --> 00:44.632
I heard of this stuff.
It looks pretty good.

00:45.254 --> 00:46.972
That's super cute on you.

00:49.091 --> 00:50.468
You've got an amazing look.

00:54.096 --> 00:55.564
I'm sorry. That sounded really creepy.

00:55.931 --> 00:58.480
My name's Malcolm Caulfield. I'm
a professional photographer.

00:58.725 --> 01:01.023
I shoot a lot of commercials
and you have a great look.

01:01.687 --> 01:03.887
If you're interested, I'd love
to shoot some test shots.

01:04.313 --> 01:06.237
Unless you're already
represented by an agency,

01:06.316 --> 01:07.488
then I could just
go through them.

01:07.568 --> 01:09.662
She's not represented by anybody.
Neither am I.

01:11.697 --> 01:12.823
Here.

01:13.490 --> 01:15.410
Take a look at my website.
You can see what I do.

01:15.659 --> 01:17.252
If you're interested,
give me a call.

01:18.161 --> 01:19.834
Either way,
thanks for your time.

01:22.624 --> 01:24.251
Yeah, you really do
have an amazing look.

01:28.338 --> 01:31.099
Oh, my God, give me that card. I'm
checking out his website right now.

01:31.174 --> 01:33.051
Oh, no, I can't do this.

01:33.135 --> 01:34.512
You can if he's legit.

01:37.681 --> 01:38.978
Are you smiling?

01:40.434 --> 01:41.731
Are you smiling?

01:43.186 --> 01:44.859
Yes, you are.
I think you're smiling.

01:45.689 --> 01:46.815
What are you thinking?

01:47.024 --> 01:48.822
I know you don't have
any language skills,

01:49.443 --> 01:50.490
but that doesn't matter

01:50.569 --> 01:52.242
you're gonna have to talk
to me sooner or later,

01:52.362 --> 01:54.035
so enough of
this silent treatment, okay?

01:55.365 --> 01:57.038
Can you say, "Daddy"?

01:57.951 --> 01:59.544
Huh? How about "Mama"?

02:00.662 --> 02:02.084
Can you say "Grimm"?

02:02.497 --> 02:04.374
I think he's a little young
for that last one.

02:04.916 --> 02:06.418
How's he doing?

02:06.501 --> 02:08.002
Pretty good.

02:08.086 --> 02:09.485
Hey. Well, he must
be getting hungry

02:09.545 --> 02:11.298
because I am getting hungry.

02:12.049 --> 02:13.426
That's your phone,
you want me to answer it?

02:13.508 --> 02:16.261
Yeah, he's holding me down right now.
Aren't you holding me down?

02:17.721 --> 02:19.064
Nick Burkhardt's phone.

02:19.389 --> 02:20.606
Ada/ind?

02:21.558 --> 02:23.731
Ju... Uh...

02:24.811 --> 02:25.858
Eve.

02:26.980 --> 02:28.152
How are you?

02:28.565 --> 02:30.112
I'm fine.

02:30.484 --> 02:31.610
How are you?

02:32.069 --> 02:33.241
I need to talk to Nick.

02:34.488 --> 02:36.661
It's Eve.
I think we should trade.

02:39.242 --> 02:40.414
Here you go.

02:41.286 --> 02:42.663
There you go, bud.

02:46.667 --> 02:47.759
Yeah?

02:48.126 --> 02:50.286
I have more information for you.
Can you come here now?

02:50.587 --> 02:51.759
Can it wait?

02:51.880 --> 02:53.006
No.

02:54.466 --> 02:55.763
All right, I'm coming over.

02:57.552 --> 02:59.646
Well, that was creepy.
Is that how she is now?

02:59.721 --> 03:01.441
Yeah, she talks just about
as much as Kelly.

03:03.100 --> 03:04.693
Look, I haveto...

03:04.768 --> 03:05.769
I heard.

03:06.395 --> 03:07.942
Guess we'll sleep well
tonight.

03:35.340 --> 03:36.512
Summer?

03:36.591 --> 03:38.138
Yeah, it's me.

03:38.802 --> 03:39.803
Sorry I'm late.

03:40.387 --> 03:41.787
I'm just
finishing up here.

03:54.192 --> 03:55.409
All right, I'm ready.

03:58.989 --> 04:01.458
Wow. Those are really nice.
Yeah?

04:02.159 --> 04:04.207
This is what we're going to be doing.

04:04.494 --> 04:05.894
Ah, great,
you brought some clothes.

04:06.580 --> 04:07.797
Yeah.
Let's get to it.

04:09.207 --> 04:10.647
Can I get you
some water or anything?

04:10.667 --> 04:11.919
Oh, no, I'm good.

04:12.669 --> 04:13.886
Just a little nervous.

04:14.504 --> 04:16.723
Me too.
Let's see what you brought.

04:22.345 --> 04:24.643
Yeah, that's a great color.
Yeah. Let's start with that.

04:24.848 --> 04:26.728
Okay. All right, changing
area's just back here.

04:26.767 --> 04:27.859
Thanks.

04:29.352 --> 04:31.821
All right, let's have you come
out here to the middle of the seamless.

04:31.897 --> 04:32.989
Right here?
Perfect.

04:33.064 --> 04:34.611
Right there on that black dot.
Okay.

04:34.691 --> 04:36.972
Try and forget about it... It's
not a camera, just like...

04:36.985 --> 04:39.079
Just breathe. Just smile.

04:39.905 --> 04:41.657
What should I do with my arms?

04:42.073 --> 04:43.450
Don't tell me
you haven't done this before.

04:44.659 --> 04:47.333
Tilt your head back. Perfect.
There you go. That's right.

04:47.412 --> 04:48.709
Rough your hair up.
I love that.

04:49.706 --> 04:50.878
Okay, eyes up.

04:51.875 --> 04:53.877
Drop your shoulder.
Tilt your head back.

04:55.879 --> 04:57.552
That is beautiful.
You're a natural.

04:58.548 --> 04:59.549
Yeah.

05:01.134 --> 05:02.977
Yeah. Yeah. Good job.

05:03.053 --> 05:04.930
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
I can hardly see.

05:05.931 --> 05:08.229
Okay, okay. Yeah,
it gets a little brutal.

05:08.892 --> 05:10.235
Not as glamorous as
everyone thinks it is.

05:10.310 --> 05:11.562
No kidding.

05:11.812 --> 05:13.852
Well, let's take a break.
Let me get you some water.

05:21.571 --> 05:22.868
There you go.

05:27.244 --> 05:29.212
That's great.
Yeah, we can use that.

05:31.414 --> 05:32.415
How am I doing?

05:32.499 --> 05:34.126
You are doing fantastic.

05:34.626 --> 05:36.219
You really think so?
Are you kidding?

05:36.461 --> 05:37.713
You're a natural.

05:38.046 --> 05:39.172
You could have a career.

05:39.256 --> 05:40.382
Really?

05:41.091 --> 05:43.719
Well, you never know in this
business, but it's possible.

05:46.596 --> 05:48.516
So, you think you're ready
for a little bit more?

05:48.974 --> 05:50.226
Yeah, sure.

05:53.770 --> 05:56.364
Beautiful. Great.
Bring your chin up.

06:01.444 --> 06:03.071
Very nice, that's great.

06:05.657 --> 06:06.874
That's perfect.

06:07.909 --> 06:09.035
Can you get your eyes up?

06:09.119 --> 06:10.211
I'm a little dizzy.

06:11.913 --> 06:12.880
Okay,
it's probably the lights.

06:12.956 --> 06:14.236
Happens if youâ€™re not
used to it.

06:14.833 --> 06:16.176
No, I think I need to
sit down.

06:16.835 --> 06:18.007
Yeah, okay.

06:18.086 --> 06:19.133
Go ahead,
take a seat on the couch.

06:19.212 --> 06:20.412
I'm just gonna
check the shots.

06:36.271 --> 06:37.488
Summer?

06:37.856 --> 06:38.903
Summer?

07:14.142 --> 07:16.611
You weren't in Portland when
Andrew Dixon was assassinated.

07:17.103 --> 07:19.606
You don't know
what you need to know.

07:19.689 --> 07:21.532
And you're gonna
tell me?

07:21.608 --> 07:23.030
That's why you're here.

07:23.109 --> 07:25.953
We identified Marwan Hanano
from a surveillance camera

07:26.029 --> 07:28.532
on west Broadway at 3:57 p.m.,

07:28.990 --> 07:30.583
17 minutes before
he gained access

07:30.659 --> 07:32.219
to the building that
overlooked the park

07:32.285 --> 07:33.885
where the political rally
was being held.

07:34.162 --> 07:35.539
Yeah, I've read the reports.

07:36.373 --> 07:37.545
They don't tell you this.

07:38.249 --> 07:41.048
Seven minutes later, he fired the
shot that killed Andrew Dixon.

07:42.045 --> 07:44.298
I located Hanano
as he was exiting the building

07:44.381 --> 07:46.930
and caused an injury so that he
would be taken to the hospital.

07:47.300 --> 07:49.553
I took his cell phone
and accessed his sim card.

07:49.636 --> 07:52.059
We had every contact
and every phone number.

07:52.722 --> 07:54.122
With the information
from his phone,

07:54.140 --> 07:55.460
we would have been
able to disrupt

07:55.475 --> 07:57.102
Black Claw's
operations in Portland.

07:58.353 --> 08:00.731
As long as Marwan Hanano
was still alive.

08:00.814 --> 08:01.815
And Renard killed him.

08:02.482 --> 08:03.483
He was supposed to.

08:04.901 --> 08:05.948
What do you mean?

08:06.027 --> 08:09.076
Renard received a call about Marwan
Hanano being in the hospital.

08:09.572 --> 08:10.573
So what?

08:11.241 --> 08:13.164
Marwan had
no identification on him.

08:13.243 --> 08:14.665
His hair had been dyed blond.

08:14.744 --> 08:16.746
No one in the hospital
could have known who he was.

08:16.830 --> 08:19.583
Only someone who knew Hanano
could have made that call.

08:19.666 --> 08:21.088
You think Renard was involved?

08:21.418 --> 08:22.920
If he wasn't,
they were using him.

08:23.878 --> 08:25.505
So you're saying
he was set up?

08:25.588 --> 08:27.135
Renard is going
to run for mayor.

08:29.634 --> 08:31.307
There's been
no official announcement.

08:31.386 --> 08:32.602
There will be.

08:32.679 --> 08:34.352
And we better know
who he's involved with.

08:34.764 --> 08:36.515
If you're right

08:36.599 --> 08:39.148
and I make a move on him
and he finds out,

08:40.145 --> 08:41.442
he's gonna know
we're onto him.

08:41.520 --> 08:43.193
I don't want you
to do anything.

08:43.273 --> 08:44.775
Except tell me
where he's gonna be.

08:45.984 --> 08:47.281
When?
Soon.

08:49.904 --> 08:51.622
That's it?
For now.

08:52.449 --> 08:53.666
Thank you for coming.

09:00.206 --> 09:02.629
Summer?
Wake up, come on.

09:04.169 --> 09:05.466
You fell asleep.

09:08.465 --> 09:09.762
Nap time's over.

09:11.134 --> 09:12.477
WOW. Uh...

09:13.595 --> 09:15.723
I must have really gone out.
Mmm-hmm.

09:15.805 --> 09:16.805
What time is it?

09:16.848 --> 09:17.849
It's a little after 9:00.

09:18.975 --> 09:21.273
You definitely had
enough for one session.

09:21.686 --> 09:23.108
Let me show you
some of these shots.

09:33.156 --> 09:34.157
Wow.

09:34.908 --> 09:36.285
These look amazing.

09:36.367 --> 09:37.664
No, you look amazing.

09:38.995 --> 09:40.212
I'll send some to you.

09:41.247 --> 09:44.000
Holy crap,
you're a supermodel.

09:44.417 --> 09:46.090
Why can't I be a supermodel?

09:46.419 --> 09:47.716
You really think they're good?

09:47.796 --> 09:49.343
Good? They're great.

09:49.547 --> 09:51.675
He said he's gonna send them
to some agents.

09:53.468 --> 09:55.186
What?
Nothing.

09:56.012 --> 09:57.434
No, what?

09:57.514 --> 09:59.354
It just looks like
you've got a little wrinkle.

10:00.266 --> 10:02.815
What?
It's nothing serious.

10:02.894 --> 10:04.271
It's just a little wrinkle.

10:04.646 --> 10:06.148
It might have
just been a shadow.

10:06.898 --> 10:09.242
It's not a shadow,
it's on my face.

10:09.317 --> 10:10.739
You just need
some moisturizer.

10:11.277 --> 10:13.905
Collin, are you here?
Okay, I'm coming right down.

10:14.447 --> 10:15.664
Where are you going?

10:15.740 --> 10:17.538
I told you.
Drinks with Collin.

10:18.576 --> 10:19.793
Drinks?

10:20.203 --> 10:22.171
You may have the face,

10:22.247 --> 10:24.420
but I got the booty.
See you in the morning.

10:27.794 --> 10:30.013
What? No way.

10:48.773 --> 10:51.151
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

10:55.446 --> 10:57.369
My teeth.

11:13.256 --> 11:14.296
How much do you have?

11:14.966 --> 11:16.138
As much as I could make.

11:19.554 --> 11:21.194
When are you gonna
tell me how you get it?

11:21.764 --> 11:23.016
If I told you,
everybody would know.

11:23.099 --> 11:24.442
Oh, I think you can trust me.

11:24.517 --> 11:26.519
I don't trust anybody.

11:26.603 --> 11:27.855
Why? Is this illegal?

11:28.938 --> 11:31.282
No, but once the secret's out,
what would I have?

11:33.943 --> 11:35.463
We need to take this
to the next level.

11:35.945 --> 11:37.572
No, we need to take it slow.

11:38.281 --> 11:39.954
This can get
out of control real easy.

11:43.286 --> 11:44.458
You're using it, aren't you?

11:45.788 --> 11:47.335
I had to make sure you
weren't trying to cheat me.

11:47.415 --> 11:48.792
I told you not to use it.

11:49.500 --> 11:50.580
This could ruin everything.

11:50.627 --> 11:52.387
I think I know what I'm doing.
No, you don't.

11:52.837 --> 11:55.511
This is powerful stuff.
A little goes a long way.

11:56.007 --> 11:57.429
All right, all right.

11:58.426 --> 11:59.769
I won't use it anymore.

12:00.053 --> 12:01.771
See that you don't.

12:02.931 --> 12:04.148
Where's my money?

12:07.477 --> 12:08.524
When do I get more?

12:09.354 --> 12:10.480
When I'm ready.

12:44.013 --> 12:45.435
Morning, superstar.

12:48.851 --> 12:50.023
Summer?

12:52.021 --> 12:54.365
You better not
still be in bed.

13:30.435 --> 13:32.275
You look like a man
with something on his mind.

13:33.313 --> 13:34.906
Yeah, well,
I saw Eve last night.

13:35.648 --> 13:37.150
How'd that go?

13:40.445 --> 13:42.197
Is the Captain here yet?
No.

13:43.323 --> 13:46.452
Eve thinks that the Captain
was set up to kill Marwan.

13:46.659 --> 13:48.707
By who?
Black Claw, maybe.

13:49.162 --> 13:51.005
But she thinks the Captain
may have been in on it.

13:51.080 --> 13:52.923
Why?
So he could be the hero.

13:53.458 --> 13:54.755
Are you kidding me?

13:55.335 --> 13:57.929
I was in the Captain's office,
so was Wu.

13:58.796 --> 14:00.264
The Captain's here.

14:01.632 --> 14:03.352
I need to see you both
in my office, please.

14:06.262 --> 14:07.684
I need your opinion
on something.

14:11.934 --> 14:14.778
As you know, I was supporting
Andrew Dixon for mayor.

14:16.689 --> 14:18.066
I truly believe
he would have won.

14:18.149 --> 14:20.698
And Gallagher is not the kind
of guy you want in office.

14:21.361 --> 14:25.036
Now I've been asked to take Dixon's
place by his campaign organization.

14:25.323 --> 14:27.403
- You're talking about running for mayor.
- I am.

14:27.408 --> 14:29.168
Now, I haven't made up
my mind yet. I just...

14:30.119 --> 14:31.559
I'd like to know
what you guys think.

14:31.621 --> 14:32.747
When do you have to
make up your mind?

14:32.830 --> 14:34.457
Soon.

14:35.083 --> 14:37.051
- This is a little sudden.
- I know.

14:37.835 --> 14:39.587
But would you back me
if I said yes?

14:41.798 --> 14:43.266
If you win,
what happens to you here?

14:43.341 --> 14:45.014
Well...

14:45.093 --> 14:46.219
I'd have to resign.

14:46.302 --> 14:47.394
Well, whoever replaces you

14:47.470 --> 14:48.813
won't know how
we handle things.

14:50.139 --> 14:51.231
No, they would not.

14:51.307 --> 14:52.987
You know what
you're getting yourself into?

14:53.101 --> 14:54.774
I just know that
we can't have Gallagher.

14:57.271 --> 14:59.490
Well, if this is what you
want, we'll back you.

14:59.982 --> 15:01.734
I appreciate that.
It's Wu.

15:03.194 --> 15:04.320
Got a body.

15:09.242 --> 15:11.244
Eve was right.
Yeah, he's gonna run.

15:11.702 --> 15:13.420
But it doesn't
answer the question.

15:13.704 --> 15:14.956
Was he in on
the assassination?

15:15.039 --> 15:16.279
Now if Black Claw's
behind this,

15:16.290 --> 15:17.792
they're gonna want him
in a position of power.

15:17.875 --> 15:19.969
Except Captain was with us when we
were attacked at the warehouse.

15:20.044 --> 15:21.421
He could have been killed.

15:21.754 --> 15:23.301
Unless he was in on that too.

15:23.381 --> 15:24.849
I think he's getting played.

15:25.341 --> 15:26.701
Or maybe he's just
taking advantage

15:26.717 --> 15:28.390
of a situation
that's coming his way.

15:28.469 --> 15:30.597
Until we know for sure,
we don't say anything.

15:37.520 --> 15:38.692
We got you.

16:46.088 --> 16:47.931
Doctor, we're ready to open.

16:49.800 --> 16:50.926
How many are there?

16:51.219 --> 16:52.471
A dozen at least.

16:52.720 --> 16:54.267
They've been knocking
for 20 minutes,

16:54.430 --> 16:56.182
I'm surprised they haven't
broken down the door.

16:58.100 --> 16:59.101
Well...

17:00.603 --> 17:01.855
Let's not keep them waiting.

17:14.282 --> 17:17.958
Good morning, everyone. Come on in.
Make sure you sign in.

17:19.204 --> 17:20.457
Hi, ladies. Hi.

17:21.415 --> 17:23.041
- Sign in?
- Yep, right there.

17:26.378 --> 17:29.178
The woman who lives here, Aimee
Diaz, came home this morning

17:29.257 --> 17:30.850
to find a dead body
in her living room.

17:31.133 --> 17:32.806
It's an old lady
she's never seen before.

17:33.219 --> 17:34.892
Was the apartment unlocked?
Nope.

17:34.971 --> 17:37.349
And no sign of a break-in,
on top of that,

17:37.431 --> 17:39.775
her roommate, Summer Blake,
is missing.

17:40.017 --> 17:42.770
She tried calling her cell phone,
but it is right over there.

17:42.853 --> 17:44.446
Tried calling
her parents' house...

17:45.481 --> 17:46.903
A few friends, no luck.

17:46.983 --> 17:48.326
The reason that's
weird is because

17:48.401 --> 17:49.948
her car and purse
are still here.

17:50.027 --> 17:51.074
Mmm.

17:51.153 --> 17:52.746
No visible signs of trauma.

17:52.822 --> 17:54.422
Does the roommate know
who this is?

17:55.032 --> 17:56.909
Well, this is where
we have the weirder part.

17:57.743 --> 17:59.791
Roommate, Aimee,
says this elderly woman

17:59.870 --> 18:02.498
is wearing what roommate,
Summer, was wearing last night.

18:02.582 --> 18:05.335
Right down to the jewelry,
ankle bracelet, and ring.

18:05.793 --> 18:07.670
- How old is Summer?
Twenty-four.

18:08.629 --> 18:10.677
So there's no way
this is Summer.

18:11.048 --> 18:13.016
Well, not in a normal no way.

18:13.801 --> 18:16.725
But I'm thinking, why would a
woman who's in her, what, 90s

18:16.971 --> 18:20.100
come here sometime last night to
put on Summer's clothes, ring,

18:20.182 --> 18:22.651
and ankle bracelet,
just to die?

18:23.019 --> 18:24.111
We'll get
the prints off the body.

18:24.186 --> 18:25.233
Let's see who it is.

18:25.438 --> 18:26.530
Yeah.
Where's the roommate?

18:27.023 --> 18:28.070
Kitchen.

18:28.149 --> 18:30.026
When was the last time
you saw your roommate?

18:30.109 --> 18:31.736
Last night, right here.

18:32.862 --> 18:34.580
That her purse?
Yes.

18:35.156 --> 18:37.284
Her wallet, her id,
everything is still in it.

18:37.533 --> 18:39.376
Nothing was taken?
I don't think so.

18:40.202 --> 18:41.328
Does she have a boyfriend?

18:41.787 --> 18:43.334
- Not right now.
- But she did?

18:43.831 --> 18:45.378
That was six months ago.

18:45.458 --> 18:48.052
His name is Matthew Parks,
but he moved to Australia.

18:48.127 --> 18:49.879
That's one of the reasons
they broke up.

18:50.087 --> 18:52.055
And you weren't here
last night?

18:52.715 --> 18:55.218
No, I stayed at
my boyfriend's house.

18:55.426 --> 18:57.394
His name is?
Collin Jones.

18:57.720 --> 18:59.313
You have any idea
who the woman is?

18:59.388 --> 19:00.389
No.

19:01.057 --> 19:03.526
But she must have something to
do with Summer disappearing.

19:03.601 --> 19:06.070
She took her clothes
and her jewelry and...

19:06.812 --> 19:08.485
She must have killed her.
And I don't know...

19:08.564 --> 19:10.191
Why would she want
to kill Summer?

19:10.733 --> 19:12.155
None of this makes any sense.

19:12.735 --> 19:14.578
Who's that?
That's Summer.

19:15.571 --> 19:17.699
A photographer just
took these yesterday.

19:18.908 --> 19:20.330
I can't believe
this has happened.

19:20.409 --> 19:21.786
We were looking
at them last night.

19:22.244 --> 19:23.587
She was gonna
be a model and...

19:24.330 --> 19:25.673
She's so beautiful.

19:26.707 --> 19:28.084
Give us a second, please.

19:30.628 --> 19:32.301
No match in the system
for an old lady.

19:33.130 --> 19:34.473
So, you got nothing?

19:34.548 --> 19:36.141
No, I got something.

19:41.597 --> 19:43.270
She had a DUI last year.

19:43.724 --> 19:45.522
Not only is
she wearing her clothes,

19:46.435 --> 19:48.028
she's wearing
her fingerprints.

19:48.604 --> 19:49.651
That's Summer Blake?

19:54.944 --> 19:58.414
My friend, Mary Ann Galvin, can't
stop talking about this treatment.

19:58.489 --> 20:00.287
And she looks unbelievable.

20:00.574 --> 20:02.827
Well, in a few minutes,

20:03.035 --> 20:05.037
you won't be able to stop
talking about it, either.

20:13.546 --> 20:14.547
Now...

20:15.256 --> 20:17.133
All I have to do
is shield your eyes...

20:20.219 --> 20:21.641
And turn off the light.

20:28.310 --> 20:30.859
The ultraviolet light
activates the formula.

20:34.316 --> 20:36.284
Is it working?

20:36.986 --> 20:38.203
Well...

20:39.530 --> 20:40.747
Let's see.

20:45.369 --> 20:46.461
You tell me.

20:48.038 --> 20:49.164
Oh, my God.

20:50.416 --> 20:52.339
Oh, my God.

20:53.002 --> 20:54.345
It's a miracle.

21:00.509 --> 21:03.058
I believe it's a hyper-intensive
form of progeria.

21:04.013 --> 21:06.015
If you're telling me
this is a 24-year-old woman,

21:06.098 --> 21:07.645
that's the only explanation
I've got.

21:07.725 --> 21:08.817
Progeria?

21:10.186 --> 21:11.563
That's an aging disease,
right?

21:11.729 --> 21:13.276
Actually a genetic disorder

21:13.355 --> 21:16.450
which causes the nuclei in a
person's cells to become unstable.

21:16.942 --> 21:19.115
The DNA inside
degrades more rapidly,

21:19.195 --> 21:20.955
and that's what causes
the accelerated aging.

21:20.988 --> 21:22.615
Doesn't that usually
happen in kids?

21:23.282 --> 21:26.286
Yes, normally it takes years
to become life threatening.

21:26.577 --> 21:27.874
Never happens this fast.

21:27.953 --> 21:29.671
Is there a possibility
it's contagious?

21:30.247 --> 21:32.875
I hope not, 'cause this would
really freak a lot of people out.

21:34.668 --> 21:37.429
Listen, if I hadn't seen the body
myself, I wouldn't have believed it.

21:37.630 --> 21:38.950
I'll get you some
of the research.

21:42.176 --> 21:43.598
What are the chances
it's progeria?

21:44.720 --> 21:45.892
I would say none.

21:50.518 --> 21:52.878
Can't do the 19th. I'm
shooting a wedding that day.

21:52.937 --> 21:56.066
But I can do
the 21 st or the 23rd.

21:58.108 --> 22:00.827
Yeah, but it's up to you.
I got both available.

22:00.903 --> 22:02.155
Afternoon? Yeah.

22:03.239 --> 22:04.919
It's time to make a change.

22:05.533 --> 22:07.911
Time to restore your true,
youthful self.

22:08.911 --> 22:10.254
Can I call you back?

22:11.288 --> 22:15.418
Shed your old, tired skin, and
restore your true, youthful self?

22:16.085 --> 22:17.962
Hi, I'm Dr. Eugene Forbes.

22:18.295 --> 22:20.764
And with my revolutionary new
fountain of youth treatment,

22:21.215 --> 22:22.432
Foy Cream,

22:22.508 --> 22:25.057
you can literally turn back
the clock on your life.

22:28.556 --> 22:31.526
Call now for an appointment
on your new life.

22:36.230 --> 22:40.235
The phone was crazy today. We're
booked up for six months.

22:40.442 --> 22:42.991
People are going bat crap
for your treatment.

22:43.070 --> 22:44.287
Yeah, I know.

22:44.947 --> 22:47.200
I've locked up.
Anything else you need?

22:48.200 --> 22:49.622
No. Go home.

22:51.787 --> 22:53.164
Well, have a good night.

22:55.708 --> 22:56.755
You too.

23:01.589 --> 23:02.590
I was just about to call you.

23:02.673 --> 23:03.674
Are you crazy?

23:04.174 --> 23:05.926
What's wrong?
The commercial.

23:06.302 --> 23:08.270
Is that your idea
of staying low key?

23:08.345 --> 23:11.224
That was not our agreement. I told
you to stay small, and go slow.

23:11.682 --> 23:14.606
Look, when you have a product
that works this well,

23:15.311 --> 23:19.157
going slow is not really possible.
People love this stuff.

23:19.315 --> 23:21.317
You have no idea
how hard it is to get it.

23:21.567 --> 23:24.070
Well, get some help
because this is gonna be huge.

23:24.153 --> 23:25.405
I can't!

23:25.487 --> 23:27.807
I've already used half the jar
that you gave me last night.

23:28.657 --> 23:30.455
I need more.
No.

23:32.453 --> 23:33.579
I'll make you partner.

23:34.496 --> 23:35.622
Fifty-fifty.

23:35.831 --> 23:37.083
Malcolm, listen to me.

23:37.666 --> 23:39.668
I don't need this.
Yes, you do.

23:39.752 --> 23:41.550
You need me. People trust me.

23:42.171 --> 23:43.468
I just have
one of those faces.

23:45.257 --> 23:46.349
Are you listening?

23:46.967 --> 23:49.311
This is worth
millions to both of us.

23:49.511 --> 23:50.854
I promise you.

23:50.930 --> 23:52.930
You'll have your first million
within three months.

23:56.060 --> 23:57.403
I'll see what I can do.

24:33.514 --> 24:35.074
You sure
it wasn't a Spinnetod?

24:35.557 --> 24:36.979
Maybe it couldn't
find a victim.

24:37.226 --> 24:39.649
They have to consume their victims'
insides in order to stay young.

24:39.728 --> 24:40.729
Ah, I don't think so.

24:41.397 --> 24:44.077
Even when a Spinnetod can't find a
victim, it doesn't age this fast.

24:44.108 --> 24:45.325
Pizza's here.

24:45.401 --> 24:46.618
Any luck?

24:46.694 --> 24:47.786
Not yet.

24:48.112 --> 24:50.160
Napkins.
Just please try to avoid

24:50.239 --> 24:52.241
the greasy fingers
on the pages.

24:54.076 --> 24:55.498
Now here's something.

24:56.036 --> 24:58.084
Looks like a journal
from an Egyptian Grimm.

24:59.206 --> 25:00.332
What have you got?

25:00.416 --> 25:01.633
It's in Arabic.

25:02.459 --> 25:03.676
Any translation?

25:06.547 --> 25:08.766
Uh, yeah. Actually yes.

25:09.383 --> 25:12.887
It's called
a musasat alsh-shabab.

25:13.679 --> 25:15.159
Sounds like something
you want to eat.

25:15.764 --> 25:17.983
"I tracked
the musasat alsh-shabab

25:18.058 --> 25:20.652
"through the streets of Cairo
for seven straight nights,

25:20.728 --> 25:22.150
"always too late to catch it.

25:22.438 --> 25:25.191
"But never too late to discover
the victims it left behind.

25:25.607 --> 25:27.826
"All of them aged
beyond their years.

25:28.110 --> 25:29.783
"One of them,
a young man who was,

25:30.154 --> 25:33.328
"I think, no more than 16 years old
because I had seen him before,

25:33.407 --> 25:37.662
"had been transformed into a
wrinkled old man within a few hours.

25:38.495 --> 25:40.714
"I knew I had to catch it
in the act to understand

25:40.789 --> 25:43.759
"how it was able to steal
the youth of its victims.

25:44.209 --> 25:47.383
"On the eighth night, I tracked
the musasat alsh-shabab

25:47.463 --> 25:49.557
"to a small back alley.

25:49.631 --> 25:53.807
"I watched with utter fascination
as it Woged, and it's..."

25:54.762 --> 25:56.230
What?
"Mandibles."

25:56.805 --> 26:00.025
"Pierced a woman's face
as she lay limp in its arms.

26:00.642 --> 26:03.486
"It appeared to suck
something from its victim

26:03.562 --> 26:05.610
"as the cheeks grew
ever larger.

26:05.939 --> 26:10.035
"When it finished with the young
woman, it disgorged the yanbue."

26:10.486 --> 26:13.990
So, we don't know what the musasat
alsh-shabab does with the...

26:14.448 --> 26:15.700
Yanbue.
Right.

26:15.783 --> 26:17.160
That it sucks out of people.

26:17.576 --> 26:18.623
Right, here's more.

26:18.702 --> 26:20.079
"And when it melts
into the skin,

26:20.162 --> 26:22.506
"age disappears, but it
becomes highly addictive,

26:22.581 --> 26:25.835
"shattering lives, and making
monsters of those who use it."

26:25.918 --> 26:27.920
Oh, well, there's a happy ending.
Not done.

26:28.003 --> 26:29.003
Sorry.

26:29.046 --> 26:30.764
"Knowing how difficult
it would be to kill,

26:30.839 --> 26:32.637
"I lay in wait
for him in his room.

26:32.966 --> 26:35.810
"After I cut off its head,
I discovered a small fortune

26:35.886 --> 26:38.514
"hidden in the walls,
but I realized only too late

26:38.597 --> 26:41.771
"that he was only
the supplier of the yanbue.

26:42.351 --> 26:45.730
"Now that he was dead, I would never
know who he was selling it to."

26:46.188 --> 26:48.782
At least we know we're dealing
with a big, ugly bug-like dude.

26:48.857 --> 26:50.109
Well, the Grimm in the book
said he was following

26:50.192 --> 26:52.160
the musasat alsh-shabab
for eight nights.

26:52.653 --> 26:54.173
That means there were
a lot of victims.

26:54.988 --> 26:58.242
Then there's probably a lot more
victims than the one we know about.

27:02.246 --> 27:04.123
You ever think about
getting into modeling?

27:04.206 --> 27:07.210
You got to be
kidding me, right?

27:07.292 --> 27:08.714
I don't make
any money kidding.

27:10.337 --> 27:12.431
Oh, Brian, that's great.
You're a natural.

27:13.382 --> 27:15.225
Could you smile, Brian?
Yeah, that's right.

27:15.717 --> 27:18.061
Good job. Great.

27:58.093 --> 28:01.893
This hyper-accelerated aging
doesn't seem to be too rare.

28:01.972 --> 28:03.440
According to
this research paper,

28:03.515 --> 28:06.314
"Medical abnormality
linked to extreme aging."

28:06.935 --> 28:08.528
There have been
half a dozen cases

28:08.604 --> 28:11.357
in and around the Portland
area in the last three years.

28:11.940 --> 28:13.533
They call it
a disease cluster.

28:13.692 --> 28:15.911
Sounds more like our
musasat alsh-shabab.

28:16.612 --> 28:18.660
They name the victim?
Yeah, at the end of the paper.

28:18.739 --> 28:20.036
Any survivors?

28:20.115 --> 28:22.959
No, but there are before
and after photos.

28:23.535 --> 28:25.958
All attacked by
a mysterious disease

28:26.038 --> 28:28.632
that aged them within 48
hours of contracting it.

28:29.124 --> 28:32.048
Call just came in. Car rolled off the road.
Driver dead.

28:32.127 --> 28:34.505
And you're telling us
about a traffic accident why?

28:34.796 --> 28:37.800
Driver appears to be in his
90s, license says he's 19.

28:38.675 --> 28:40.268
Thought you might
want to check it out.

28:45.307 --> 28:48.231
Prints off the body match Brian Grady.
He's the owner of that truck.

28:48.810 --> 28:52.485
According to witnesses, the driver
lost control, ended up here.

28:55.943 --> 28:57.820
Doesn't look 19 to me.

29:05.244 --> 29:08.168
"Malcolm Caulfield,
studio photographer."

29:08.914 --> 29:10.461
Yeah, got a cell phone.

29:10.874 --> 29:13.673
See if we can get the last
numbers called and received.

29:13.752 --> 29:14.844
Yeah.

29:15.045 --> 29:18.390
Didn't the last victim say
they saw a photographer too?

29:18.465 --> 29:20.263
Oh, that's what
her roommate said.

29:20.342 --> 29:21.719
I think we should
talk to this photographer

29:21.802 --> 29:24.042
'cause I don't think this guy's
got a career in modeling.

29:32.604 --> 29:33.821
Looks legit.

29:33.897 --> 29:35.570
What if
he's musasat alsh-shabab?

29:36.024 --> 29:38.118
Well, if he is, he knows
nobody can tie him

29:38.193 --> 29:39.445
to what happened
to the victims.

29:39.528 --> 29:41.408
All right, well, how do
you want to handle this?

29:41.571 --> 29:44.620
First we have to figure out if he's
working alone or with somebody else.

29:45.325 --> 29:46.668
You leave
the Grimm in the car?

29:46.743 --> 29:48.040
For now.

29:49.121 --> 29:51.215
Come in. I'll be right there.

29:51.832 --> 29:54.460
Listen, I got to go.
Can I call you back tomorrow?

29:54.543 --> 29:56.966
Terrific.
Yeah, looking forward to it.

30:00.924 --> 30:02.301
Can I help you?

30:02.801 --> 30:04.394
Malcolm Caulfield?
Yes.

30:05.178 --> 30:07.476
Detective Burkhardt.
This is Detective Griffin.

30:07.723 --> 30:08.940
What'd I do?

30:09.266 --> 30:10.946
'Cause I don't remember
doing anything bad.

30:11.435 --> 30:13.437
You shoot these photos?

30:13.520 --> 30:15.898
Uh, Summer Blake.
Yeah, I did.

30:16.606 --> 30:18.233
She's a beautiful girl.

30:19.568 --> 30:21.070
Well, is she in
some kind of trouble?

30:21.153 --> 30:23.076
What about Brian Grady?
You take pictures of him?

30:23.739 --> 30:25.036
Yeah, last night.

30:25.907 --> 30:26.954
What's going on?

30:27.034 --> 30:28.035
They're both dead.

30:29.745 --> 30:30.837
What?

30:31.580 --> 30:33.708
How?
Did they know each other?

30:33.915 --> 30:35.087
Not that we know of.

30:37.294 --> 30:38.762
Oh, my God.
This is why you're here.

30:38.837 --> 30:41.090
Look,
I just took pictures of them.

30:41.423 --> 30:42.424
Why?

30:42.966 --> 30:44.806
Well they're both
very attractive young people.

30:44.843 --> 30:46.683
It's what I do for a living.
I discover talent.

30:46.970 --> 30:48.938
I didn't know beauty
qualified as talent.

30:49.056 --> 30:52.151
Talent is in
the eye of the beholder.

30:52.225 --> 30:54.819
A lot of my clients have gone
on to very successful careers.

30:55.020 --> 30:57.239
I mean, look at these faces.

30:57.314 --> 30:58.816
They're naturally beautiful.

30:58.899 --> 31:01.277
And in the right light,
that is about as close

31:01.360 --> 31:02.612
to perfect as
you're ever going to get.

31:02.694 --> 31:04.913
I mean, that is who
we all want to be.

31:08.950 --> 31:10.918
How did they die?
We're not sure.

31:11.244 --> 31:12.291
Where did you meet them?

31:12.579 --> 31:13.876
At Union Way mall.

31:14.373 --> 31:15.716
I meet my clients
in a lot of places.

31:15.791 --> 31:18.795
Malls, parks, streets.
I'm always looking.

31:18.877 --> 31:21.221
You know, you never know when you're
gonna meet that next Heidi Klum.

31:22.381 --> 31:24.099
Look, do you think I had
something to do with this?

31:24.174 --> 31:26.347
Just have to backtrack
everywhere they've been.

31:29.930 --> 31:32.649
If you think of anything
else, give us a call.

31:37.979 --> 31:40.573
A lot of beautiful people
up on those walls.

31:40.649 --> 31:42.617
Kind of like trophies.

31:42.692 --> 31:45.366
Think we can tie any of them to the
ones we found in the medical report?

31:45.445 --> 31:46.445
Well, it's worth a look.

31:46.488 --> 31:48.081
Let's run his phone records.

31:48.156 --> 31:50.500
And put some
surveillance on him.

31:57.999 --> 31:59.922
- Hello?
- Did you get more?

32:00.001 --> 32:01.469
Yeah, but...
Bring it to me.

32:01.545 --> 32:03.092
Look, two cops
were just at my place.

32:03.171 --> 32:04.263
Bring it to me now.

32:04.339 --> 32:05.431
Did you hear what I just said?

32:05.507 --> 32:06.599
I don't care
what you just said.

32:06.675 --> 32:09.053
Bring me the stuff now.
This is big business.

32:11.805 --> 32:14.684
My God, you look fabulous.

32:17.018 --> 32:19.271
Doctor, we have a lot
of patients waiting.

32:19.354 --> 32:20.901
I'm coming!

32:28.196 --> 32:29.448
If Malcolm's supplying
someone

32:29.531 --> 32:31.533
with something he's taking
from his victims,

32:31.616 --> 32:33.256
more than likely
he would have made a call

32:33.285 --> 32:34.878
after Brian and
Summer left his studio.

32:35.328 --> 32:37.248
Well, then we isolate
the numbers Malcolm called.

32:37.706 --> 32:39.049
All right.

32:40.709 --> 32:42.882
Three different numbers
were called on those dates.

32:44.087 --> 32:45.885
One is a photo supply store.

32:45.964 --> 32:49.389
Another one's a dry cleaners.
And the last one's a clinic.

32:49.468 --> 32:51.015
What kind of clinic?

32:53.889 --> 32:55.266
Beauty treatment.

32:55.599 --> 32:56.976
And he's got
his own commercial.

32:57.058 --> 32:58.059
Play it.

32:59.686 --> 33:01.484
It's time to make a change.

33:01.855 --> 33:04.404
Time to restore your true,
youthful self.

33:05.317 --> 33:07.157
Do you ever wish
you could turn back the clock,

33:07.694 --> 33:11.744
shed your old, tired skin, and
restore your true, youthful self?

33:12.449 --> 33:14.497
Hi, I'm Dr. Eugene Forbes.

33:14.659 --> 33:17.162
And with my revolutionary new
fountain of youth treatment,

33:17.579 --> 33:18.751
Foy Cream,

33:18.830 --> 33:19.956
you can literally...

33:20.040 --> 33:21.383
Foy Cream?

33:22.250 --> 33:23.877
We talking
Fountain of Youth?

33:25.337 --> 33:26.714
We may have just
found our buyer.

33:27.214 --> 33:28.932
We're gonna need somebody
to check him out.

33:30.091 --> 33:31.183
Yeah.

33:31.551 --> 33:34.225
If this photographer is
the musasat alsh-shabab,

33:34.471 --> 33:36.769
then they might be using the
clinic to sell the yanbue.

33:36.973 --> 33:38.441
So, they've gone
mainstream.

33:38.517 --> 33:40.565
This doctor's selling it
out of a spa.

33:40.644 --> 33:43.443
Don't forget, repeated use is
supposed to turn people who use it

33:43.522 --> 33:44.899
into monsters, okay?

33:45.941 --> 33:48.410
So, look, if you go in there,
do not mess with this stuff.

33:48.735 --> 33:50.203
Okay.
What do you want me to do?

33:50.362 --> 33:52.282
See if you can get a sample
of what he's selling.

33:52.405 --> 33:53.827
We take it to the lab.

33:53.907 --> 33:55.987
If it's human-based, we know
we've got the right guy.

33:57.202 --> 33:58.203
Okay.

34:04.626 --> 34:05.878
Thank you.
Mmm-hmm.

34:13.134 --> 34:16.388
Hi, I'm Rosalee Calvert.
I have an appointment at 5:00.

34:18.556 --> 34:20.757
I'm sorry.
I don't see your name.

34:21.141 --> 34:22.782
Huh.
I booked it three weeks ago.

34:23.520 --> 34:24.567
Hmm.

34:24.646 --> 34:26.614
No. I'm sorry,
I don't have you.

34:27.315 --> 34:30.534
Oh, my God. I just drove
all the way from Salem.

34:30.652 --> 34:32.654
I confirmed this. Are you sure
you have the right clinic?

34:32.737 --> 34:35.159
Yeah, the Foy Cream, right?
Dr. Forbes?

34:36.116 --> 34:37.833
Look,
I'll try to squeeze you in,

34:37.909 --> 34:38.956
but you'll have to wait.

34:39.536 --> 34:40.661
Thank you.

34:40.745 --> 34:43.418
You understand the first appointment
is just a consultation?

34:43.498 --> 34:45.500
The fee for
the treatment is $5,000.

34:46.626 --> 34:47.672
No problem.

34:48.878 --> 34:51.380
Then you'll need to
fill out this paperwork.

34:54.509 --> 34:55.681
I got to say,

34:56.136 --> 34:57.683
are you sure you need
this treatment?

34:58.513 --> 35:00.732
Oh. One can never look
too young.

35:06.146 --> 35:07.363
Hi.
Hi.

35:08.440 --> 35:09.657
Have you had this
treatment before?

35:09.733 --> 35:10.950
Oh, no. It's my first time.

35:13.778 --> 35:17.328
I know it's expensive,
but my friends look amazing.

35:17.866 --> 35:19.163
And they're older than me.

36:18.218 --> 36:19.435
What do you think?

36:20.220 --> 36:21.346
You look amazing.

36:21.429 --> 36:22.931
I do, don't I?

36:23.056 --> 36:25.150
Oh, I'm so glad I came.

36:25.225 --> 36:26.898
My husband's gonna think
he's having an affair.

36:28.103 --> 36:29.446
And I might have one myself.

36:33.525 --> 36:35.527
Ms. Calvert?
Dr. Forbes will see you now.

36:38.613 --> 36:40.115
May I take your coat?
Please.

36:41.199 --> 36:43.122
Thank you. This way.

36:49.624 --> 36:51.752
Doctor,
this is the last patient.

36:52.669 --> 36:53.795
Do you need me to stay?

36:54.045 --> 36:55.342
No, I'll lock up.

36:56.631 --> 36:57.757
Okay.

36:58.299 --> 36:59.979
Please have a seat.

37:00.135 --> 37:02.058
I will be with you
in just a second.

37:06.099 --> 37:08.227
Hi. I'm Dr. Forbes.

37:10.311 --> 37:11.403
Rosalee Calvert.

37:11.479 --> 37:12.605
Nice to meet you, Rosalee.

37:12.856 --> 37:14.324
Let's see what we have here.

37:15.400 --> 37:17.994
This special cream you use,
can you tell me what's in it?

37:18.695 --> 37:21.073
Oh, I'm sorry, I can't.
It's a secret.

37:23.700 --> 37:24.701
Oh.

37:25.285 --> 37:26.285
I can see why you came.

37:26.327 --> 37:27.624
What? Really?

37:28.204 --> 37:29.956
It's never too early
to start the treatment.

37:30.123 --> 37:31.249
Oh, boy.

37:31.332 --> 37:32.925
All of
these imperfections,

37:33.001 --> 37:35.845
they will completely disappear
after just one treatment.

37:36.671 --> 37:38.423
Imperfections?
What imperfections?

37:38.798 --> 37:40.675
Oh, this was not
a good idea.

37:41.009 --> 37:42.306
You know what?

37:42.969 --> 37:45.347
We shouldn't wait.
We should start right away.

37:45.930 --> 37:47.450
I thought this was
just a consultation.

37:47.515 --> 37:49.275
We cannot let her put
that stuff on her face.

37:49.350 --> 37:50.943
This will take
years off your face.

37:51.019 --> 37:52.659
I think I need to really
think about this.

37:57.275 --> 37:58.697
And
there's our photographer.

37:59.569 --> 38:01.492
Okay, guys, we got to pull
the plug on this one.

38:01.571 --> 38:02.697
Yeah.

38:03.031 --> 38:04.999
Don't you want to be younger
and more beautiful?

38:05.325 --> 38:07.043
I think I'm kind of
happy the way I am.

38:07.744 --> 38:09.087
Seriously?

38:10.872 --> 38:12.249
Okay, fine.

38:12.707 --> 38:14.209
I'm certainly not
going to waste this.

38:14.667 --> 38:16.419
Hey. Let me show you
what it does.

38:26.596 --> 38:27.973
I'll just let myself out.

38:28.473 --> 38:29.645
No, no, no. Wait.

38:30.225 --> 38:33.104
You have to see. Now go
ahead, guess how old I am.

38:33.228 --> 38:35.151
Uh...
How old do I look?

38:35.230 --> 38:36.310
What the hell
are you doing?

38:37.065 --> 38:39.443
Oh, good, you're here. Did you bring more?
I'm all out.

38:39.818 --> 38:41.491
I told you
not to use that stuff.

38:41.569 --> 38:43.116
I need more.
Who is she?

38:43.238 --> 38:44.865
Did you bring it?
Yeah, I did.

38:44.948 --> 38:46.575
Give it to me.
What is she doing here?

38:46.658 --> 38:48.035
Nothing.
I was just leaving.

38:48.535 --> 38:49.661
Give it to me.

38:50.912 --> 38:51.913
Hey.

38:52.288 --> 38:53.585
Get the hell away from her.

38:56.459 --> 38:58.382
No! No! My cream!

38:59.754 --> 39:01.506
He's
the musasat alsh-shabab!

39:12.267 --> 39:13.439
I'll find a new jar.

39:33.079 --> 39:34.205
Don't move.

39:39.794 --> 39:41.216
What am
I gonna do now?

39:41.296 --> 39:42.343
It's broken.

39:42.922 --> 39:44.344
And it's your fault.

39:47.844 --> 39:49.312
You never
answered my question.

39:49.971 --> 39:51.143
What?

39:51.222 --> 39:52.690
How old do I look?

39:56.352 --> 39:58.775
I'm 69 years young.

40:05.194 --> 40:06.696
Andrew believed that
Portland deserved a mayor

40:06.779 --> 40:08.622
that was willing
to fight for its people.

40:09.991 --> 40:11.711
Now, I've been asked
to take Andrew's place.

40:12.952 --> 40:15.455
And after long consideration,
I've realized that the only way

40:15.538 --> 40:18.883
to support Andrew's vision of
the city is to take his place.

40:18.958 --> 40:21.336
And, so, today,
I'm formally announcing

40:21.419 --> 40:23.342
my candidacy for
mayor of Portland.

40:31.679 --> 40:32.931
Here we go.
