No, we comin' to check out

our five mil investment.

02:36.364 --> 02:37.489
Remind Vernon that it's me,

02:37.572 --> 02:39.114
and have a little bit of trust,

02:39.198 --> 02:40.280
and you guys be

I just signed a big Coke deal

into a sponsorship

with the Surf Channel

02:50.489 --> 02:52.156
and an acquisition
of the WSL.

Yo, man, relax. Chill, man,
I'm just fuckin' with you.

02:54.989 --> 02:58.073
We're comin' out 'cause Vernon
gettin' his number retired
at General Carver High.

That's amazing news!

03:00.198 --> 03:01.906

03:12.948 --> 03:15.156
Except my childhood
I spent mostly

03:15.239 --> 03:18.906
laying in bed,
black light on,
Skynyrd on the turntable.

03:18.989 --> 03:21.864
Well, I'm glad chaos
was your creature comfort,

03:21.948 --> 03:24.906
because I, unlike you,
never grew up high
and traumatized.

03:24.989 --> 03:26.322
Well, you better
get used to it,

03:26.405 --> 03:28.114
because Lance
is having a meltdown.

03:28.198 --> 03:30.405
Lance:
Ryan, you little motherfucker,

03:30.489 --> 03:32.322
this is not a proposition
from Wittgenstein.

03:32.405 --> 03:34.697
All right, lads.
This is a simple,
fucking request.

03:34.781 --> 03:37.156
Find Parker,
get him on the fucking phone

03:37.239 --> 03:38.489
so that I can speak to him.

03:38.572 --> 03:41.322
Gotta go. There's some
grownups here. Fuck you!

03:41.405 --> 03:42.614
Guten tag.

03:42.697 --> 03:44.530
Hey. What's goin' on,
Lance?

03:44.614 --> 03:45.572
We got a big problem.

03:46.906 --> 03:48.989
Parker's missing.

03:49.073 --> 03:50.948
Like "face on
a milk carton" missing,

03:51.031 --> 03:53.739
or "I just don't want
to call my wife" missing?

03:53.822 --> 03:57.031
I got a text from him yesterday
telling me he wiped out
skateboarding.

03:57.114 --> 04:00.364
I call him today
to check how he is--
kid won't take my calls.

04:00.447 --> 04:02.697
We've got a global campaign
worth millions,

04:02.781 --> 04:05.239
Coca-Cola's sponsoring him--
he can't surf!

04:05.322 --> 04:06.572
He signed a contract.

04:06.656 --> 04:09.405
We've got commercials,
banners, soda cans,

04:09.489 --> 04:10.989
but he's gotta fucking surf.

04:11.073 --> 04:13.697
The whole deal is predicated
on the kid fucking surfing

04:13.781 --> 04:15.697
at the fucking Classic.

04:15.781 --> 04:19.530
Does he typically
abandon you in times
of crisis like this?

04:19.614 --> 04:21.364
We got like
a father-son relationship,

04:21.447 --> 04:23.405
except he'd like
a different father,
I'd like a different son.

04:23.489 --> 04:25.530
- It's complex.
- Joe: Let us intervene.

04:25.614 --> 04:28.739
We are uniquely qualified
to deal with very talented
and delinquent people.

04:28.822 --> 04:30.989
Because he's talented,
and I'm delinquent.

04:31.073 --> 04:33.530
That's not a bad idea,
because if I catch up with him,

04:33.614 --> 04:35.697
that surfboard
is going up his ass.

04:35.781 --> 04:38.114
We got you. Just do
what I do before big games.

04:38.198 --> 04:39.405
What's that?

04:39.489 --> 04:41.447
Bang my head against
a fuckin' locker.

04:41.530 --> 04:44.280
I love moving day!
Especially with you, babe.

04:44.364 --> 04:45.572
- Mm-hmm?
- Mm-hmm.

04:45.656 --> 04:48.239
That goes through there,
in the master.

04:48.322 --> 04:50.906
Oh, fellas, that's going
to the master, too.

04:50.989 --> 04:53.697
Wrong. That goes
in the guesthouse
with TTD.

04:53.781 --> 04:54.864
- TTD: Yes!
- What T need with that?

04:54.948 --> 04:56.739
That's a $40,000 mattress!

04:56.822 --> 04:58.364
Let a nigger rest in comfort.

04:58.447 --> 05:00.239
You gonna rest in peace,
you keep talkin'.

05:00.322 --> 05:01.781
If you really think that shit

05:01.864 --> 05:03.697
that you fucked all
your little ho's on

05:03.781 --> 05:06.073
is coming into my  bedroom,
you lost your mind.

05:06.156 --> 05:07.739
In all fairness to Rick,

05:07.822 --> 05:09.656
I never saw him
with another girl on that bed

05:09.739 --> 05:12.280
- till he met you, Amber.
- TTD? Shut the fuck up.

05:12.364 --> 05:15.280
I mean, that's nobody
before you, babe.

05:15.364 --> 05:18.364
That's as accurate
as me saying there was
nobody before you.

05:18.447 --> 05:20.656
But you best know
there's no one after me.

05:20.739 --> 05:22.031
You damn right.

05:22.114 --> 05:23.948
And I don't want
nor need anybody else,

05:24.031 --> 05:25.405
so you know what, TT,

05:25.489 --> 05:26.948
mattress is yours.

05:27.031 --> 05:28.280
Oh, yeah!

05:28.364 --> 05:29.614
You know I'm gonna
take care of it.

05:29.697 --> 05:32.198
- Mmm. Mmm. Mmm.
- So disgusting.

05:32.280 --> 05:33.948
- Can you even see your dick?
- ( phone ringing )

05:34.031 --> 05:36.239
TTD:
I can see it
when I pull it out.

05:36.322 --> 05:39.614
Spencer, babe.
I gotta take this.

05:39.697 --> 05:41.198
Where you goin'
with my cereal?

05:43.239 --> 05:44.948
Don't pitch me on Cleveland,

05:45.031 --> 05:47.656
'cause at this point
I just might take that shit, J.

05:47.739 --> 05:49.614
Jason:
No. I have an inspired idea.

05:49.697 --> 05:51.198
I just need your approval first.

05:51.280 --> 05:53.239
All right, good.
Lay it on me.

05:53.322 --> 05:54.822
How about I call our boy
at the Rams?

05:54.906 --> 05:57.781
Shit, I don't know
about that.

05:57.864 --> 06:00.322
Chuck is not
gonna go to bat for me

06:00.405 --> 06:01.822
after what happened in Miami.

06:01.906 --> 06:03.198
Buddy, the past is the past.

06:03.280 --> 06:04.906
If he wants to be
a great GM,

06:04.989 --> 06:06.405
then he needs
to be opportunistic.

06:06.489 --> 06:08.989
Let's hope he has
short-term memory loss.

06:09.073 --> 06:10.530
You're not
a charity case.

06:10.614 --> 06:13.031
You'd fit perfectly
into their offense.

06:15.364 --> 06:17.739
- I'm not looking for a handout.
- We're not begging.

06:17.822 --> 06:19.280
We're gonna call him up,
like gentleman.

06:19.364 --> 06:20.822
Like dons.

06:20.906 --> 06:25.073
You always know what to say,
don't you, Jason?

06:25.156 --> 06:27.364
All right.
But you make the call.

06:27.447 --> 06:30.697
I'm trying to keep some distance
between me and rejection, baby.

06:30.781 --> 06:32.073
You got it, buddy.

06:36.073 --> 06:37.614
Spencer:
Dealing with this shit

06:37.697 --> 06:39.614
is just like dealing
with Sizz or Ricky.

06:39.697 --> 06:41.156
Joe:
That's why
you're gonna be great at it.

06:41.239 --> 06:42.614
I love your optimism,
buddy.

06:42.697 --> 06:44.739
It's not optimism.
That's reality, pal.

06:44.822 --> 06:46.697
This is what you were
put on the planet to do.

06:46.781 --> 06:48.614
I have football
pumpin' through my veins.

06:48.697 --> 06:50.656
That's what we should
be focusing on.

06:50.739 --> 06:54.364
- Yeah. We'll do that after we--
- ( phone chiming )

06:54.447 --> 06:55.989
One second.

06:56.073 --> 06:57.239
Hello.

06:57.322 --> 06:59.239
Spencer. Jayda Crawford.

06:59.322 --> 07:01.364
Jayda. Jayda...

07:01.447 --> 07:03.906
Jason Antolotti's friend?

07:03.989 --> 07:05.697
Quincy Crawford's mom?

07:05.781 --> 07:08.114
Ah! That  Jayda.

07:08.198 --> 07:10.239
- Yes. How are you?
- I'm great, thanks.

07:10.322 --> 07:13.614
I spoke to Jason,
and I really appreciate
you offering

07:13.697 --> 07:16.239
to set aside some time
to meet with me.

07:16.322 --> 07:19.198
Of course. Any friend of Jason
is a friend of mine.

07:19.280 --> 07:21.239
Nice to be referred to
as more than "Q's mom."

07:21.322 --> 07:22.864
I bet it is,

07:22.948 --> 07:25.073
but trust me, you haven't
seen anything yet, Jayda.

07:25.156 --> 07:26.489
Nothing surprises me anymore.

07:26.572 --> 07:27.739
I'm gonna be up

07:27.822 --> 07:29.864
in your neck of the woods
later today.

07:29.948 --> 07:32.073
What's your evening
looking like?

07:32.156 --> 07:34.405
Wide open.

07:34.489 --> 07:38.280
How about we meet
at the Viceroy
for drinks, 7:00 p.m.?

07:38.364 --> 07:40.697
Perfect. See ya then.

07:40.781 --> 07:42.656
Ciao.

07:42.739 --> 07:44.948
( laughing )

07:45.031 --> 07:47.572
Did you just
fucking say "Ciao"?

07:47.656 --> 07:51.739
- Goddamn, I did, didn't I?
- Yes, you did! Holy shit!

07:51.822 --> 07:56.364
Wow. Listen, are you
thinking about messing with
that high school kid?

07:56.447 --> 07:58.031
Come on.  You know me.

07:58.114 --> 07:59.572
Yeah, I know you better
than you know yourself.

07:59.656 --> 08:01.405
You can't resist temptation.

08:01.489 --> 08:04.405
All right, I promise you
I'm gonna steer clear
of that kid, OK?

08:04.489 --> 08:05.781
OK.

08:05.864 --> 08:08.280
Even though he is
once in a generation.

08:08.364 --> 08:09.656
Spencer:
Aw, fuck.

08:11.364 --> 08:13.031
Oh, shit. Another hook.

08:13.114 --> 08:15.447
Can you pass me
another ball, please?

08:15.530 --> 08:17.364
( phone chiming )

08:17.447 --> 08:19.405
Actually, act like
a real boyfriend

08:19.489 --> 08:21.114
and put it on
the fuckin' tee for me.

08:21.198 --> 08:23.114
( chiming )

08:23.198 --> 08:24.739
Charles. How's life

08:24.822 --> 08:26.739
- on the high perch?
- Stressful.

08:26.822 --> 08:28.614
Very stressful.
And it only just begun.

08:28.697 --> 08:30.948
You sound like a lifer already.

08:31.031 --> 08:33.739
Good news. I got
just the thing that's gonna

08:33.822 --> 08:37.948
- lower your blood pressure.
- Fantastic. I'm all ears.

08:38.031 --> 08:41.614
Goff tore it up last year,
but he needs another weapon.

08:41.697 --> 08:45.198
- I got just the guy for you.
- Really. Who you got?

08:45.280 --> 08:47.114
The one and only
Ricky Jerret.

08:47.198 --> 08:48.156
No siree.

08:48.239 --> 08:50.031
You ever heard that phrase

08:50.114 --> 08:52.156
"Fool me once, shame on you,

08:52.239 --> 08:54.489
fool me twice,
go fuck yourself"?

08:54.572 --> 08:56.822
- That's this.
- Look, I feel you,

08:56.906 --> 08:58.656
but don't stand on ceremony.

08:58.739 --> 09:01.031
The guy's a great value,
he's got plenty of tread left,

09:01.114 --> 09:02.906
and, don't tell him
I told you this,

09:02.989 --> 09:05.322
but I could probably get you
a friends and family discount.

09:05.405 --> 09:08.322
Oh, OK. You know what?
I'll think about it, then.

09:08.405 --> 09:10.322
Just for you, though.
Not for him.

09:10.405 --> 09:12.156
Good lookin' out, big guy.

09:12.239 --> 09:14.322
Talk to you soon. Bye.

09:14.405 --> 09:18.239
Hey, can you get me
another basket
of fuckin' balls?

09:18.322 --> 09:19.614
Sorry, babe.

09:19.697 --> 09:22.656
Are you really considering
signing Ricky?

09:22.739 --> 09:23.864
Hell, no.

09:25.405 --> 09:26.530
Not for nothin',

09:26.614 --> 09:28.031
but I'm a pretty good listener.

09:28.114 --> 09:31.073
- What?
- If you want to talk, or...

09:31.156 --> 09:33.530
In case you haven't noticed,
I'm not much of a talker.

09:33.614 --> 09:35.114
You just need to
listen to Parker.

09:35.198 --> 09:36.156
OK. ( sighs )

09:39.447 --> 09:40.864
( jiggles doorknob )

09:40.948 --> 09:42.280
( whispers ) What the fuck?!
What are you doing?!

09:42.364 --> 09:43.739
Never announce yourself

09:43.822 --> 09:45.364
when the perp is on the run.

09:45.447 --> 09:47.781
I don't know if
this is the best way

09:47.864 --> 09:51.322
to introduce ourselves
to the SoCal surf community.

09:51.405 --> 09:53.114
( rap music playing )

10:00.697 --> 10:04.447
Yo, I think two bald guys
just broke into your crib.

10:04.530 --> 10:06.864
Dudes, you ever
hear of a doorbell?

10:06.948 --> 10:08.948
My bad. Uh, ding-dong.

10:09.031 --> 10:11.697
Damn. That was
a real G move.

10:11.781 --> 10:13.489
We're Lance's
new partners.

10:13.572 --> 10:15.447
Bosses. Technically.

10:15.530 --> 10:17.405
I seen your pic around,
big man. I know who you are.

10:17.489 --> 10:19.198
Grab a drink
or smoke or something.

10:19.280 --> 10:21.198
- We'd love to.
- Eh, yeah.

10:21.280 --> 10:23.114
Did you make sure
the bottle's not too hot?

10:23.198 --> 10:24.405
Yes, Daddy.

10:24.489 --> 10:26.280
You gave her six ounces,
right?

10:26.364 --> 10:28.948
Of course, man.
I wouldn't cheat her
out of her lunch.

10:29.031 --> 10:32.073
Plus the doctor said
there's no such thing
as overfeeding her right now

10:32.156 --> 10:34.031
as long as it's breast milk.

10:34.114 --> 10:36.739
Don't be thinking about using
them chubby titties of yours.

10:36.822 --> 10:38.572
Are you gentlemen looking
for something special?

10:38.656 --> 10:40.239
Yeah, we are.

10:40.322 --> 10:41.822
We're not a couple,
if that what you're thinking.

10:41.906 --> 10:45.322
I'm hetero as fuck...
and available.

10:45.405 --> 10:47.447
You want me to post that
somewhere for you?

10:47.530 --> 10:49.530
Throwin' shade.
I like that.

10:49.614 --> 10:51.405
That's the one Bubba Watson
uses, right?

10:51.489 --> 10:53.198
Won the Masters
wearing it.

10:53.280 --> 10:55.489
What you think, T?
You think they'll let me
play with a Chrono?

10:55.572 --> 10:57.073
I'm gonna say a big "fuck no."

10:57.156 --> 10:58.656
Besides, you're
retired anyway.

10:58.739 --> 11:00.114
We'll see what Chuck
gotta say about that.

11:00.198 --> 11:02.114
Ha! You got a better chance

11:02.198 --> 11:03.906
of playing
for Belichick again.

11:03.989 --> 11:05.614
Why is it every time
shit goes bad, it's an "I,"

11:05.697 --> 11:07.530
but when shit is poppin',
it's "we" again?

11:07.614 --> 11:10.572
I don't know,
but we should do
something nice for Chuck.

11:10.656 --> 11:12.781
Send him something
to welcome him to L.A.

11:12.864 --> 11:15.447
Congratulation him
on his new job.

11:15.530 --> 11:18.114
Finally opened your mouth
and something good comes out.

11:18.198 --> 11:19.447
All right, so what
we gonna do?

11:19.530 --> 11:21.280
Depends on how bad
you want the job.

11:21.364 --> 11:23.489
That's like asking
a Death Row inmate
if he craves parole.

11:23.572 --> 11:26.447
This one says,
"Please hire me."

11:26.530 --> 11:28.572
Do we get a deal
if we buy two?

11:28.656 --> 11:30.781
Can you focus,
please?

11:30.864 --> 11:33.280
This is nice.
Box this up,
ship it to him.

11:33.364 --> 11:35.114
Say it's from both of us.
Thank you.

11:35.198 --> 11:37.656
Just need your credit card.

11:37.739 --> 11:38.739
Yeah!

11:42.822 --> 11:44.822
Oh, no, no, no, no.
I get high on life.

11:44.906 --> 11:48.239
If you're trying
to build a bond between us,
you're failin', man.

11:48.322 --> 11:49.948
Come on, Joe,
let's take a hit.

11:50.031 --> 11:52.906
All right. Big Man
says take a hit,

11:52.989 --> 11:55.073
Little Man takes a hit.

12:01.031 --> 12:03.739
( coughing )
Holy fuck!

12:03.822 --> 12:06.822
That's the force
of Skywalker, brah.

12:06.906 --> 12:08.156
No shit, huh?

12:08.239 --> 12:10.822
Ooh! May the Force
be with you, pal.

12:10.906 --> 12:12.280
All right.

12:12.364 --> 12:14.156
Well, I don't get high
when I work.

12:14.239 --> 12:15.280
There you go.

12:17.031 --> 12:20.364
So what's the problem with
Lance, and how can we help?

12:20.447 --> 12:22.198
Yeah. I mean,
we love Lance.

12:22.280 --> 12:24.697
He's a weasel
who's only in it
for himself.

12:24.781 --> 12:27.198
- Yeah. Weasel, brah.
- That's a little harsh.

12:27.280 --> 12:28.530
Joe:
Yeah, a little bit.

12:28.614 --> 12:29.864
Especially since he landed you

12:29.948 --> 12:31.864
that massively awesome
Coke deal.

12:31.948 --> 12:33.781
For who, Coke?

12:35.322 --> 12:36.697
That's the problem.

12:36.781 --> 12:38.614
Let me show you something
real quick.

12:40.280 --> 12:43.906
This is the Coke campaign
we did down on the beach.

12:43.989 --> 12:46.031
You see, this...

12:46.114 --> 12:48.530
is what the ad lackeys
turned it into.

12:48.614 --> 12:50.198
Looks like a dope image
to me.

12:50.280 --> 12:51.739
Yeah, if my skin
were that color.

12:51.822 --> 12:53.614
What? Give me that thing!

12:55.031 --> 12:56.697
I don't see
a big difference.

12:56.781 --> 12:58.489
Maybe you color blind.

12:58.572 --> 13:01.198
You're also not gonna pretend
to be somebody you're not.

13:01.280 --> 13:04.198
Right on. Look, I'm proud
to be a black man.

13:04.280 --> 13:06.989
I just don't want to be
the Great Black Hope.

13:07.073 --> 13:09.239
You feel me?
I just want to be
one of the boys,

13:09.322 --> 13:13.530
not a "black" surfer,
but the greatest  surfer. Ever.

13:13.614 --> 13:16.322
Right? I'm from Laguna,
you feel me? Not the hood.

13:16.405 --> 13:19.530
If they want to market me,
they gotta do it for real.

13:19.614 --> 13:21.656
I don't want to be Obama, bro.

13:21.739 --> 13:23.822
Joe:
I gotta stop you
right there, son.

13:23.906 --> 13:25.489
You don't want to be Obama.

13:25.572 --> 13:27.239
That's-- I'm fucked--
I don't--

13:27.322 --> 13:28.614
- Don't you want to be Obama?
- Joe. Joe.

13:28.697 --> 13:30.114
- Hey.
- Joe: I would.

13:30.198 --> 13:31.906
I understand
where you're comin' from.

13:31.989 --> 13:34.781
What happens if I'm a no-show
at this tourney tomorrow?

13:34.864 --> 13:37.280
Coke has you under contract,
and you would be in breach.

13:37.364 --> 13:39.906
Can they sue me
or something?

13:39.989 --> 13:42.739
We get sued all the time.
We're getting sued
left and right.

13:42.822 --> 13:47.447
I mean, I'll go so far
as to say that you're not a man
until you've been sued.

13:47.530 --> 13:51.739
And divorced. And  accused
of at least one homicide.

13:51.822 --> 13:54.031
( laughs )
No more Skywalker
for this guy.

13:54.114 --> 13:57.364
Look, I would just want you
to do what feels right.

13:57.447 --> 14:00.948
- Yeah.
- Joe: Right is m-might.

14:01.031 --> 14:02.239
Right is...

14:04.031 --> 14:05.530
...might?

14:06.697 --> 14:08.405
All right, fellas.

14:08.489 --> 14:12.156
In anticipation
of this upcoming draft
and pending free agency,

14:12.239 --> 14:14.530
I wanted to take this time
to outline our approach.

14:14.614 --> 14:15.948
It's gonna be
a little bit different

14:16.031 --> 14:17.656
than it's been
in other years,

14:17.739 --> 14:20.114
because this year,
we gonna steal from the past

14:20.198 --> 14:22.447
and combine it with the future.

14:22.530 --> 14:24.280
Like Eastern and Western
medicine.

14:24.364 --> 14:27.322
Like colonoscopies
and acupuncture.

14:27.405 --> 14:29.530
- ( laughter )
- Settle down now.

14:29.614 --> 14:31.989
All I'm saying is,
I want us to be different.

14:32.073 --> 14:34.031
But most of all
I want us to think  different.

14:34.114 --> 14:35.156
Wasn't that an Apple commercial?

14:35.239 --> 14:36.781
Exactly.

14:36.864 --> 14:38.822
And now they possess
the world's biggest market cap.

14:38.906 --> 14:41.322
( whispers )
You're losing them.
Get to the football part.

14:41.405 --> 14:44.114
All right, so,
we're gonna focus on value.

14:44.198 --> 14:47.530
And here comes
the Moneyball pitch.

14:47.614 --> 14:51.156
I'm happy with
where we are defensively,
personnel-wise.

14:51.239 --> 14:54.322
So we're gonna continue
to focus on the offensive
side of the ball.

14:54.405 --> 14:55.989
Goff's come into his own--

14:56.073 --> 14:58.614
so let's get Goff
a comfort blanket.

14:58.697 --> 15:01.989
You know, somebody
like a Whitten or a Gronk.

15:02.073 --> 15:04.656
- Gives McVay more flexibility.
- Exactly.

15:04.739 --> 15:07.280
I also want to look
into finding another
possession receiver.

15:07.364 --> 15:09.822
Be really nice to find somebody
who can work the slot,

15:09.906 --> 15:11.198
like Doug Baldwin.

15:11.280 --> 15:12.822
Ricky Jerret.

15:12.906 --> 15:14.364
Excuse me?

15:14.447 --> 15:15.572
Word on the street is,

15:15.656 --> 15:17.114
he's considering un-retiring.

15:17.198 --> 15:19.948
I worked with him in Green Bay.
I like him.

15:20.031 --> 15:23.198
That's a good idea.
He'd be cheap as dirt, too.

15:23.280 --> 15:26.697
Yeah. Coach McVay
has expressed interest
in Kisan Teague.

15:26.781 --> 15:29.364
- Um, he's a running back.
- I'm aware,

15:29.447 --> 15:31.447
and Coach wants
to move him to the slot.

15:31.530 --> 15:33.530
Jerret's a great value.

15:33.614 --> 15:35.198
And he's got experience.

15:35.280 --> 15:37.198
Yeah, but is he still in shape?

15:37.280 --> 15:39.322
I mean, you know,
have his skills deteriorated?

15:39.405 --> 15:41.530
Only one way to find out.

15:41.614 --> 15:43.447
Put him through the paces.

15:43.530 --> 15:46.156
Work him out.

15:46.239 --> 15:47.822
Thank you guys for coming,

15:47.906 --> 15:49.405
but where are the Coke peeps at?

15:49.489 --> 15:51.614
They couldn't make it
on such short notice.

15:51.697 --> 15:53.405
We're Samuels,
Harris & Hartwick,

15:53.489 --> 15:55.906
the agency handling
their account.

15:55.989 --> 15:59.864
- SHH.
- ( Joe giggling )

15:59.948 --> 16:01.114
Shh!

16:02.322 --> 16:04.280
Like "shh."

16:04.364 --> 16:05.822
That's the name
of your firm, right?

16:05.906 --> 16:07.530
- That's right.
- That's what you said?

16:07.614 --> 16:10.447
I'm the "S,"
from Samuels.
Founding partner.

16:10.530 --> 16:15.405
- ( loud clatter )
- I got it. Sorry.

16:15.489 --> 16:16.822
Coca-Cola empowers us.

16:16.906 --> 16:18.697
They leave
the granular details to me,

16:18.781 --> 16:20.572
if you have any questions.

16:20.656 --> 16:22.239
Or concerns. I--

16:22.322 --> 16:25.864
Sorry. I didn't know
there was a meeting
scheduled today.

16:25.948 --> 16:27.156
We came and looked for you.

16:27.239 --> 16:29.073
Well, I was in
my floatation tank,

16:29.156 --> 16:31.073
you needed only
to rap on the lid.

16:31.156 --> 16:32.572
Is there something wrong
with your eyes?

16:32.656 --> 16:34.906
Let me jump into this
really quickly, guys.

16:34.989 --> 16:37.781
We're aware that Parker's image
has been manipulated.

16:37.864 --> 16:40.447
It wasn't manipulated.
It was finished.

16:40.530 --> 16:42.739
Splitting hairs
did not save the rabbit.

16:44.156 --> 16:45.489
Either way,

16:45.572 --> 16:48.239
this is not an accurate
representation of Parker.

16:48.322 --> 16:49.781
We disagree.

16:49.864 --> 16:52.447
I don't have a fucking clue
what you Aryans

16:52.530 --> 16:54.114
are chatting about
right now.

16:54.198 --> 16:57.322
They changed the skin tone
of Parker to fit this campaign,

16:57.405 --> 16:59.198
Lance, and it's not cool.

16:59.280 --> 17:02.948
It's a couple of shades,
from caramel to beige.

17:03.031 --> 17:05.114
Does your client
know about this?

17:05.198 --> 17:09.322
Our client has no clue
what shade Parker is,
was, or will be.

17:09.405 --> 17:11.948
We could make him
Oompa Loompa orange.

17:12.031 --> 17:14.156
- ( laughs )
- We like how Parker looks.

17:14.239 --> 17:15.697
Actually, we love  it.

17:15.781 --> 17:19.989
Guys, you are selling Parker
based off his race.

17:20.073 --> 17:21.948
I won't deny race
is a component.

17:22.031 --> 17:23.822
A black surfer
is very unique.

17:23.906 --> 17:25.906
Parker is his own individual
for sure,

17:25.989 --> 17:27.656
but take it from me,
a man of color

17:27.739 --> 17:29.489
who lives and works
in a white world,

17:29.572 --> 17:32.156
sometimes we just
want to be recognized
for our talents.

17:32.239 --> 17:36.280
I wouldn't want to be called
"The best Caucasian
money manger in the world."

17:36.364 --> 17:37.989
That would really bum me out.

17:38.073 --> 17:41.489
I think we can sidebar this
for a little while, shall we?

17:41.572 --> 17:44.405
SHH and Coca-Cola
put a lot of time

17:44.489 --> 17:47.031
and a lot of resources
into this brilliant campaign,

17:47.114 --> 17:48.948
and I think we should really
respect their efforts.

17:49.031 --> 17:52.697
This campaign
will make Parker
a household name.

17:52.781 --> 17:55.989
And he'll only benefit
from his association
with Coke.

17:56.073 --> 17:57.697
Let me be clear
with you guys.

17:57.781 --> 17:59.614
You're gonna change
Parker's skin tone

17:59.697 --> 18:01.447
back to its original
fuckin' color,

18:01.530 --> 18:05.198
and I'm sure your client Coke
won't think it's too granular.

18:05.280 --> 18:07.489
It's too late.

18:07.572 --> 18:10.280
Then maybe you don't count
on Parker showing up tomorrow.

18:10.364 --> 18:12.572
ASM recently
acquired Sports X.

18:12.656 --> 18:14.781
That makes you
equally liable.

18:14.864 --> 18:18.364
Lance:
Oh! OK, then,
nobody's suing anybody.

18:18.447 --> 18:21.198
Parker will be out there
on them waves tomorrow,

18:21.280 --> 18:24.114
brown as you like,
carbonated if you want,

18:24.198 --> 18:26.198
or I'll legally change my name

18:26.280 --> 18:29.364
to Lance "Fuck Me in the Ass"
Klians.

18:29.447 --> 18:32.906
OK? So why don't we
have a quick chat outside.

18:32.989 --> 18:35.948
Do excuse us for a moment
while we handle

18:36.031 --> 18:38.322
this obviously
delicate issue.

18:39.739 --> 18:41.489
Sorry. Excuse me.

18:42.948 --> 18:44.405
Guys, what the fuck?!

18:44.489 --> 18:46.697
I'm the brains
and the charisma.

18:46.781 --> 18:48.614
You're the face and torso,
evidently,

18:48.697 --> 18:50.405
and Joe, you cut the checks.

18:50.489 --> 18:52.989
Now we're all clear
about our respective roles,

18:53.073 --> 18:54.781
we can move on perhaps, yeah?

18:54.864 --> 18:58.781
Because this deal
long precedes your tenure
with Sports X.

18:58.864 --> 19:00.322
Don't shit
in the apple cart!

19:00.405 --> 19:02.073
I don't give a fuck
about the apple cart.

19:02.156 --> 19:03.697
All I care about is doing
the right fuckin' thing.

19:03.781 --> 19:06.781
- It's how we're wired.
- Well, not always.

19:06.864 --> 19:08.739
But no, most of the time.

19:08.822 --> 19:13.572
Have you got any idea
how many hours I've sunk
into this deal with Coca-Cola?

19:13.656 --> 19:16.239
They're one of the most
recognizable brands
in the world.

19:16.322 --> 19:18.364
We need 'em,
and others like 'em.

19:18.447 --> 19:21.614
We can't fuck this up
'cause you're acting like
a couple of amateurs.

19:21.697 --> 19:23.114
If Parker don't show tomorrow,

19:23.198 --> 19:25.198
that's $3 million
flushed down the toilet,

19:25.280 --> 19:27.322
2 million of which
belongs to us,

19:27.405 --> 19:29.031
by the fucking way.

19:29.114 --> 19:31.114
And all because
some 19-year-old surf diva

19:31.198 --> 19:32.989
don't like the lighting
in a fuckin' advert?

19:33.073 --> 19:34.906
Come on.
I've got news for you.

19:34.989 --> 19:38.322
You turn out the lights,
we're all fucking pitch-black.

19:39.447 --> 19:41.739
- Whoa.
- Strasmore,

19:41.822 --> 19:43.614
don't get precious
about that kid.

19:43.697 --> 19:45.656
It ain't about talent no more.

19:45.739 --> 19:47.239
The world has changed.

19:47.322 --> 19:49.073
If you look at that poster,

19:49.156 --> 19:51.656
it hasn't changed
enough for me.

19:54.739 --> 19:56.198
Nothing to add.

20:06.864 --> 20:08.031
All right.

20:10.739 --> 20:13.156
- Spencer Strasmore?
- Jayda, you found me.

20:13.239 --> 20:15.156
Well, you're hard to miss.

20:15.239 --> 20:17.156
Well, you have
quite the presence yourself.

20:17.239 --> 20:19.405
You need to when
you're a public defender.

20:19.489 --> 20:21.405
Can't have a thin skin, either.

20:21.489 --> 20:23.822
I can imagine.
Would you like a drink?

20:23.906 --> 20:25.822
Don Julio Blanco,
rocks, please.

20:25.906 --> 20:28.447
Oh. I like your choice.

20:28.530 --> 20:30.405
It's been
one of those weeks.

20:30.489 --> 20:32.405
Amen. I feel ya.

20:32.489 --> 20:35.405
Jason tells me that
I should treat you like family.

20:35.489 --> 20:38.322
He's sweet.
Did he tell you that
we went to law school together?

20:38.405 --> 20:39.614
No.

20:39.697 --> 20:41.614
He parlayed his degree
into millions,

20:41.697 --> 20:44.572
and I'm just trying
to save the world
one perp at a time.

20:44.656 --> 20:47.239
( laughs ) Well,
both very noble pursuits.

20:47.322 --> 20:50.364
I want Quincy
to find a school
that checks all the boxes.

20:50.447 --> 20:53.614
If he has to go,
I want him to exit

20:53.697 --> 20:55.864
more evolved
than when he entered.

20:55.948 --> 20:58.656
- So what are the rules?
- NCAA says there's rules,

20:58.739 --> 21:00.198
but really
it's just hypocrisy.

21:00.280 --> 21:02.489
Who's watching out
for the kids then?

21:02.572 --> 21:05.322
Well, the parents.
But a lot of times
that's not even the case.

21:05.405 --> 21:07.073
Well, that sounds perverse.

21:07.156 --> 21:09.239
Look, I've seen your son play,
and he's pretty special.

21:09.322 --> 21:10.822
He's gonna kill it
anywhere he goes.

21:10.906 --> 21:14.280
He's a rare one.
You did good.

21:15.781 --> 21:19.198
So, how do I manage
this whole situation?

21:19.280 --> 21:22.031
You know the expression
"The clothes make the man"?

21:22.114 --> 21:23.864
Yeah, I'm lookin' at it.

21:23.948 --> 21:28.572
Well, in this case,
you know,

21:28.656 --> 21:30.864
these institutions
are gonna want you to think

21:30.948 --> 21:33.198
that they will define
your son's career,

21:33.280 --> 21:35.198
but the truth is,
Quincy is so talented

21:35.280 --> 21:38.697
anywhere he goes,
he's gonna define
that institution.

21:38.781 --> 21:40.739
Well, that sounds great,

21:40.822 --> 21:43.822
but he's never gonna
take advice from his mother.

21:43.906 --> 21:46.073
So, would you do me a favor
and talk to him?

21:46.156 --> 21:48.447
I would love to, Jayda,
but I can't.

21:48.530 --> 21:51.198
It goes against the rules
of my NFL registration.

21:51.280 --> 21:53.156
But I'm here-- for you.

21:53.239 --> 21:55.447
Talking, text--
whatever you need.

21:55.530 --> 21:58.948
- I may take you up on that.
- Great.

21:59.031 --> 22:01.864
TTD:
Surf Classic's today.
Think we should check it out?

22:01.948 --> 22:03.781
That's that surfboard invite
we got?

22:03.864 --> 22:04.989
- ( doorbell rings )
- Yeah.

22:05.073 --> 22:06.656
Thinking about giving it a try.

22:06.739 --> 22:08.114
Don't.

22:08.198 --> 22:09.864
I don't even know why
I try with you, man.

22:09.948 --> 22:11.739
No balance.

22:11.822 --> 22:14.280
- TTD: What up, Chuck?
- Charles: What's happenin'?

22:14.364 --> 22:16.572
Thank you for
the "Welcome to L.A." watch.

22:16.656 --> 22:18.447
Just glad it fit
your big-ass wrist.

22:18.530 --> 22:21.114
Chuck.
You trollin' the neighborhood?

22:21.198 --> 22:22.447
Ha! Not exactly.

22:22.530 --> 22:25.447
Hell of a hood, though.
Damn, what a house!

22:25.530 --> 22:27.948
Be great to get me
and the missus
something like this one day.

22:28.031 --> 22:31.614
They're selling one
four doors down.
It's for sale. 12.5.

22:31.697 --> 22:33.239
Oh, that's all, 12.5?

22:33.322 --> 22:35.530
Little out of my price range.

22:35.614 --> 22:37.614
Not if you make
the right decisions, G.M.

22:37.697 --> 22:39.572
- They make bank nowadays.
- Yeah.

22:39.656 --> 22:42.906
It's funny you say that.
That's why I'm here.

22:42.989 --> 22:44.781
This is business?

22:44.864 --> 22:47.530
- Jason didn't mention it?
- Nah.

22:47.614 --> 22:49.864
- Not a peep.
- Huh.

22:49.948 --> 22:53.656
Hey, man, how's your head
feelin' lately?

22:53.739 --> 22:56.280
My head?
Just a memory, baby.

22:56.364 --> 22:59.656
All right. I wanted
to talk to you about
playing again.

22:59.739 --> 23:02.322
And since the last time
me and you went down that road

23:02.405 --> 23:04.656
things got a little funky
between us, I wanted to come
do it in person.

23:04.739 --> 23:06.781
Shit, man, it's all good.

23:06.864 --> 23:09.364
And if I do come back,
I want to be like
Marshawn Lynch,

23:09.447 --> 23:11.073
you know, be in
the right situation.

23:11.156 --> 23:13.322
So if we talkin' about
playin' in Cali, with you,

23:13.405 --> 23:16.656
- then I'm interested.
- Great. I'm interested, too.

23:16.739 --> 23:18.906
Could be great for Goff.
You seen this kid throw?

23:18.989 --> 23:20.447
Got good
pocket presence, too.

23:20.530 --> 23:21.989
- He's good.
- Ooh.

23:22.073 --> 23:24.073
But I'm new with
this whole GM thing,

23:24.156 --> 23:27.447
and I like to do my homework,
so I can't be playing favorites.

23:27.530 --> 23:29.198
- Favorites?
- Yeah, that's why I wanted

23:29.280 --> 23:30.864
to come down here
and speak to you face-to-face,

23:30.948 --> 23:32.489
so there'd be no
misunderstanding.

23:32.572 --> 23:34.614
Because in order for this
whole thing to happen,

23:34.697 --> 23:35.656
I'm gonna need
to see you work out.

23:35.739 --> 23:37.322
You need to see me work out?

23:37.405 --> 23:39.364
- Like I'm a walk-on?
- You got a problem with that?

23:39.447 --> 23:40.781
I ain't got a problem
with workin' out.

23:40.864 --> 23:42.781
You do got a problem with it.
I can see it.

23:42.864 --> 23:44.280
I got a problem with
workin' out. Yeah, you right.

23:44.364 --> 23:46.156
See that? OK.
You know what?

23:46.239 --> 23:48.198
I'm gonna take
my poppy seed bagels and go.

23:48.280 --> 23:50.031
Don't forget
your cream cheese.

23:50.114 --> 23:52.322
This was our  cream cheese,
Ricky!

23:56.031 --> 23:58.280
I thought you wanted
the damn job.

23:58.364 --> 24:00.781
You're  gonna
need a new job
in a second.

24:02.489 --> 24:05.948
( music playing )

24:06.031 --> 24:09.031
Announcer:
Welcome to Huntington Beach,
California.

24:09.114 --> 24:11.614
It's finals day
at the Surf Classic.

24:11.697 --> 24:13.280
I am your voice,
and today,

24:13.364 --> 24:15.572
we are gonna
crown our champion,

24:15.656 --> 24:17.697
as we go right to live action.

24:23.489 --> 24:24.864
Calm down.

24:24.948 --> 24:26.948
Jesus. Fuck, I am  calm.

24:27.031 --> 24:28.822
On the inside I'm calm.

24:28.906 --> 24:30.864
We support our guys,
we fight to the death,

24:30.948 --> 24:33.489
and we let our guys
make their own choices.

24:33.572 --> 24:34.781
Our fate is our fate.

24:34.864 --> 24:36.530
Yeah, yeah. That's great.

24:36.614 --> 24:38.822
Sometimes, I swear to God,
honestly,

24:38.906 --> 24:40.614
I would give my left nut

24:40.697 --> 24:43.906
to be a chubby,
Third-World fascist dictator,

24:43.989 --> 24:45.405
not give anybody
any options.

24:45.489 --> 24:48.073
Lance:
Oh! Ha ha ha!

24:48.156 --> 24:49.364
Joe:
What's he so happy about?

24:49.447 --> 24:51.364
Ah, there we go.

24:51.447 --> 24:54.031
Joe:
Oh, look at that.
Wearing the Coke hat.

24:54.114 --> 24:58.280
( laughs )
Top o' the mornin' to
you pair of ugly pricks!

24:58.364 --> 25:00.906
Thank God the boy
has got more brains
than you, eh?

25:00.989 --> 25:02.156
( grunts )

25:02.239 --> 25:03.530
And we know
he's got more talent.

25:03.614 --> 25:04.739
Don't we?

25:04.822 --> 25:07.114
Let's see
if he brought it.

25:07.198 --> 25:10.031
- Still overdressed.
- Overdressed?

25:13.697 --> 25:16.697
( music playing )

25:34.906 --> 25:36.906
( music, no dialogue )

25:40.073 --> 25:42.614
( rock song,
lyrics indistinct )

26:02.989 --> 26:05.656
( crowd cheering )

26:05.739 --> 26:08.906
- Spencer: Wow.
- Joe: Yeah. Perfect wave.

26:08.989 --> 26:10.198
Perfect ride!

26:10.280 --> 26:13.156
And that is a perfect day
in our world.

26:13.239 --> 26:14.697
- Beautiful.
- Very nice.

26:14.781 --> 26:17.447

In second place,
Peter Smith!

26:40.114 --> 26:43.781
Well done.
Irrelevant,
but well done.
