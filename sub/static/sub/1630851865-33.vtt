Light bulb. Check.

Backup battery. Charged.

00:36.199 --> 00:38.320
Switch. Working.

00:38.480 --> 00:39.920
Hey, Ollie. Watcha doing?

00:40.040 --> 00:41.600
Checking over my night light.

00:41.720 --> 00:44.640
Once a month,
I make sure it's in tip-top shape.

00:44.760 --> 00:47.320
I sure wouldn't want it to go out
in the middle of the night,

00:47.440 --> 00:50.280
because... Well, because...

00:50.440 --> 00:52.720
Ollie, are you afraid of the dark?

00:52.879 --> 00:55.000
Me? Pff! No!

00:55.440 --> 00:57.360
-Hmm.
-A little.

00:57.519 --> 01:01.120
OK, a lot! But I'm all right
as long as I have my night light.

01:01.239 --> 01:03.279
You know, it's no big deal
if you're afraid of the dark!

01:03.400 --> 01:05.960
Shh! I don't want anyone to know.

01:06.119 --> 01:08.600
But, Ollie, lots of people are afraid of--

01:08.720 --> 01:11.360
Afraid of what?
Is somebody afraid of something?

01:11.479 --> 01:13.560
Hmm? I thought you just said...

01:13.800 --> 01:17.160
Never mind. Look, guys!
We got an invitation from Dang!

01:17.280 --> 01:19.280
-Our friend from Thailand?
-Uh-huh!

01:19.399 --> 01:22.440
And he's invited us all
to the Loi Krathong Festival!

01:22.600 --> 01:25.039
I don't know what that is,
but it's at night!

01:25.160 --> 01:29.200
You mean a festival
that happens in the... dark?

01:29.360 --> 01:31.320
I know, right? How fun is that?

01:31.440 --> 01:35.320
But what kind of festival
happens in the... dark?

01:35.440 --> 01:38.839
He says it's a surprise
and we'll love it.

01:39.000 --> 01:40.720
He wants us to help him with it.

01:40.839 --> 01:42.759
-Of course!
-I'm in!

01:42.880 --> 01:44.320
-Oh, boy...
-Ollie,

01:44.479 --> 01:47.199
is there maybe something
you want to tell Moon?

01:47.360 --> 01:49.080
I'm sure she'd understand.

01:49.199 --> 01:50.080
Just...

01:50.640 --> 01:54.199
Lemme grab my bag and...
might as well take my night light.

01:54.600 --> 01:55.640
Since it's right here!

01:56.240 --> 01:59.520
I'll be OK as long as I have
my night light.

02:06.240 --> 02:07.199
Whoo!

02:08.239 --> 02:09.960
Whee!

02:18.040 --> 02:21.359
<i>Now arriving in Thailand.</i>

02:26.959 --> 02:27.799
Whoa!

02:27.920 --> 02:29.079
[shattering glass]

02:29.239 --> 02:30.400
I'm OK!

02:33.480 --> 02:36.320
But something in my backpack isn't!

02:36.799 --> 02:39.480
-Oh, no!
-Your night light got wrecked.

02:39.600 --> 02:43.679
-That's too bad, Ollie.
-Too bad?

02:44.519 --> 02:46.720
[nervous laugh]
It's actually no big deal.

02:46.880 --> 02:50.160
I don't need a night light.
What am I... afraid of the dark?

02:50.280 --> 02:51.640
[nervous laugh]

02:51.760 --> 02:53.120
[laughs] I'll put this in the trash.

02:54.519 --> 02:57.640
Don't worry, Ollie!
Maybe I've got a night light in my shell.

02:57.760 --> 02:59.000
Hang on!

03:01.359 --> 03:02.320
No.

03:03.079 --> 03:05.359
Maybe it's in the second dining hall.

03:06.760 --> 03:08.880
Sorry, Ollie!
I could have sworn I had one

03:09.040 --> 03:11.480
behind the grand piano, but nope.

03:11.600 --> 03:13.640
Stanley, I've gotta get a new night light

03:13.799 --> 03:16.040
before it gets dark! Help me!

03:16.160 --> 03:17.399
You got it, Ollie!

03:20.359 --> 03:23.519
I'll distract, Moon.
You get that night light!

03:23.679 --> 03:24.840
Mmm-hmm.

03:25.560 --> 03:27.079
-Do you have a night light?
-No.

03:27.239 --> 03:28.560
-Do you have one?
-Sorry.

03:29.040 --> 03:31.079
What kind of festival
do you think Loi Krathong

03:31.239 --> 03:34.079
-is going to be, Ollie?
-I hope it's a salad festival!

03:34.239 --> 03:38.560
Mmm! Lettuce, cucumber,
chrysanthe-mum-mum-mums.

03:38.679 --> 03:41.040
-Do you have a night light?
-Sorry.

03:41.200 --> 03:44.679
Mmm! And croutons! Oh, look! A tuk-tuk!

03:44.799 --> 03:46.200
Yeah. Those are fun.

03:46.320 --> 03:49.519
Night light?

03:49.840 --> 03:52.679
-Ollie...
-Is there something in my eye?

03:52.799 --> 03:56.000
Whoa! I dunno.
Is there supposed to be ooze?

03:56.119 --> 03:59.880
Oh, sure. I'm a snail. I'm all about ooze.

04:00.040 --> 04:02.040
-Right, Ollie?
-Right, Stanley.

04:02.160 --> 04:04.880
Oh! There he is! Dang!

04:05.679 --> 04:07.839
-Find a night light?
-No. Not yet.

04:08.239 --> 04:10.000
-Hi, Dang!
-Hello!

04:10.160 --> 04:11.600
-Hi!
-Hello, friends!

04:12.239 --> 04:13.799
Moon, you're looking well.

04:13.959 --> 04:15.880
Stanley, you're looking oozy.

04:16.000 --> 04:19.519
And, Ollie, you're looking... worried?

04:19.680 --> 04:22.400
Worried we'll be late to the festival
and miss something!

04:22.560 --> 04:24.039
[nervous laugh]

04:24.200 --> 04:25.560
Actually, me, too!

04:25.680 --> 04:27.840
So let's head to the beach and get ready.

04:28.000 --> 04:30.080
I am so glad you want to help.

04:30.200 --> 04:32.560
There's lots to do before sunset!

04:32.680 --> 04:34.080
Um... Dang?

04:34.200 --> 04:37.760
Before we go, do you know
where I could buy a night light?

04:37.880 --> 04:38.880
It's for a friend.

04:39.000 --> 04:42.159
Sure! I'll find you one down
at the beach.

04:42.320 --> 04:43.800
Hurray!

04:46.280 --> 04:49.280
You are going to love this!

04:54.200 --> 04:56.640
Oh! Isn't this beautiful?

04:56.760 --> 04:59.560
It's like being on a deserted island!

05:00.120 --> 05:03.960
Yeah. A deserted island
without any night-light stores.

05:04.080 --> 05:06.440
How exactly is Dang
going to find me one here?

05:06.560 --> 05:09.039
Unless that bird's got one in its nest,

05:09.360 --> 05:11.039
you need to go back to town.

05:12.680 --> 05:14.240
Aw, man!

05:14.760 --> 05:18.599
OK, guys! We're gonna need
lots of reeds for the festival

05:18.760 --> 05:20.520
to make something special.

05:20.640 --> 05:23.560
You are going to love it!

05:26.520 --> 05:28.240
Maybe if we get this done fast,

05:28.359 --> 05:30.719
I can still make it back
to town for the night light.

05:30.840 --> 05:32.159
Let's hurry!

05:32.280 --> 05:35.400
Did you really just say
"Let's hurry" to the snail?

05:37.640 --> 05:39.919
[groans]

05:40.039 --> 05:43.599
There you go!
Now, who else is thirsty after that?

05:43.719 --> 05:46.280
How about I get us all drinks
from in town!

05:46.400 --> 05:49.440
No need, Ollie!
I have fresh coconut water for us.

05:50.680 --> 05:53.880
That way we can start weaving baskets
from these reeds.

05:54.000 --> 05:55.000
Like this one!

05:55.240 --> 05:59.800
I wonder what we're going to use
a basket for... in the dark!

05:59.919 --> 06:04.840
Is it for... hiding under?
Hiding inside? Or protection?

06:04.960 --> 06:06.640
Protection? From what?

06:06.760 --> 06:09.400
I dunno.
Whatever's out there in the dark,

06:09.520 --> 06:11.599
waiting to surprise us!

06:12.200 --> 06:14.320
I know you're curious about the basket.

06:14.479 --> 06:18.280
But trust me, you guys,
you're going to love it!

06:18.400 --> 06:19.400
[laughs]

06:19.840 --> 06:21.320
Now, watch. It's easy!

06:21.440 --> 06:25.760
You go over and under, over and under...

06:25.880 --> 06:27.760
Oh! It's no use!

06:27.880 --> 06:31.280
I'm way too excited to sit still
and make a basket, Dang!

06:31.400 --> 06:32.840
And I'm too nervous!

06:32.960 --> 06:34.760
Dang, how about I make the baskets?

06:34.880 --> 06:37.120
Then Ollie and Moon
can do something else for you.

06:37.640 --> 06:39.880
Like sneak off into town.

06:40.599 --> 06:43.240
Is there anything we need in town?

06:43.359 --> 06:45.560
Actually, we still need rice paper!

06:45.680 --> 06:49.200
Thanks, guys. Here's a map.
You can take my boat.

06:50.880 --> 06:52.240
It'll get you there faster.

06:52.359 --> 06:56.320
-But Ollie doesn't like boats.
-I'll manage!

06:56.599 --> 06:59.479
Anything to help you
with your errand in town.

07:05.400 --> 07:09.120
Ollie, I think we were supposed
to go right back there.

07:09.239 --> 07:12.479
No problem! This way will take us
to the shopping area of town.

07:12.599 --> 07:14.960
I'm sure we can find rice paper there.

07:15.080 --> 07:17.640
Dang told us to go that way
because it's faster.

07:17.919 --> 07:22.919
We have... to get back...
before dark for... the festival!

07:23.039 --> 07:25.719
It's OK. Just let me...

07:25.840 --> 07:27.880
-Ollie!
-Whoa!

07:30.520 --> 07:32.599
-Uh-oh!
-Where are we?

07:32.719 --> 07:35.599
Oh, no! We're lost!

07:36.440 --> 07:38.400
And the sun is setting!

07:38.520 --> 07:42.479
It's OK, Ollie.
We've been lost before. I'm sure we'll...

07:43.440 --> 07:46.039
Aaah! D-d-dragonfly!

07:46.400 --> 07:48.039
Oh, yeah! Cool.

07:48.359 --> 07:52.400
Except...
Moon, are you afraid of dragonflies?

07:52.520 --> 07:54.200
Yes! Is it gone?

07:56.520 --> 07:57.359
OK. It's gone.

07:57.799 --> 08:00.200
I didn't know you were afraid
of dragonflies, Moon.

08:00.320 --> 08:02.840
I know. It's so embarrassing.

08:02.960 --> 08:06.359
No, Moon, it's not!
Everybody's afraid of something.

08:06.479 --> 08:09.120
-I'm afraid of water.
-And I'm afraid of thunder.

08:09.239 --> 08:11.560
-And I'm scared of boats!
-Tube socks!

08:11.679 --> 08:13.799
-Heights!
-The bathtub drain!

08:13.919 --> 08:17.280
-The dark!
-Wait. The dark?

08:17.400 --> 08:20.799
Ollie, I didn't know
you were afraid of the dark!

08:20.919 --> 08:25.239
Yeah. I should've told you,
but I was embarrassed too.

08:25.359 --> 08:28.679
But your night light broke.
And it's almost sundown!

08:28.799 --> 08:29.960
Poor Ollie!

08:30.080 --> 08:32.600
We have to get out of here
and get you a night light!

08:32.720 --> 08:33.799

09:07.920 --> 09:10.920
Dang, I know
we're supposed to go to the festival,

09:11.040 --> 09:14.040
but right this minute
we have to get Ollie a night light,

09:14.160 --> 09:15.720
-because--
-I'm afraid of the dark.

09:15.839 --> 09:17.079
[gasps]

09:17.199 --> 09:20.319
But that's OK,
because everybody's scared of something.

09:20.439 --> 09:22.760
So you need a night light, huh?

09:22.880 --> 09:26.480
-Surprise!
-Wow!

09:26.600 --> 09:29.439
It's the night light
I promised you, Ollie.

09:29.560 --> 09:31.160
But you guys were taking so long

09:31.280 --> 09:33.800
I had to get the rice paper
myself to finish them in time.

09:34.079 --> 09:37.400
It's the most beautiful night light
I've ever seen!

09:37.520 --> 09:38.920
And it's for the festival?

09:39.040 --> 09:43.160
It's for the Loi Krathong Festival,
with lanterns!

09:43.280 --> 09:45.560
So that's why it happens at night!

09:45.680 --> 09:49.839
Uh-huh. It's the best festival
of the year, because...

09:50.000 --> 09:51.520
Well, you'll see.

09:56.240 --> 09:57.560
It's getting awfully dark.

09:57.839 --> 10:01.360
But you have your night light,
right? And me! And...

10:02.360 --> 10:04.040
Wow!

10:04.439 --> 10:07.680
I told you you were gonna love it!

10:07.800 --> 10:09.640
So many little lights!

10:09.760 --> 10:13.600
The dark doesn't seem
so scary now, huh, Ollie?

10:13.760 --> 10:16.240
The tradition is to make a wish
on the lantern

10:16.360 --> 10:19.439
-and send it into the sky.
-I'd wish for a night light,

10:19.600 --> 10:22.439
but it looks like I already got my wish.

10:22.560 --> 10:25.240
I'm going to wish
for more nights like this one,

10:25.360 --> 10:26.560
with friends!

10:26.680 --> 10:29.560
I'm going to wish
for the next festival to be...

10:29.720 --> 10:31.280
a salad festival.

10:31.400 --> 10:33.839
[laughter]

10:35.319 --> 10:39.240
My new lantern night light
is so warm and cosy, isn't it?

10:39.400 --> 10:42.640
And look! I can make a monster!
Grr! Grr!

10:44.079 --> 10:47.959
-Oh. Is that too scary, Ollie?
-Scary? Not for me.

10:48.120 --> 10:51.480
-Stanley, on the other hand...
-As long as I have my teddy.

10:51.640 --> 10:53.920
Maybe I left it behind at the front desk.

10:54.079 --> 10:55.079
[grunting and rattling]

10:55.240 --> 10:56.920
Got it!

10:57.040 --> 10:59.000
[laughter]

11:03.240 --> 11:06.319
[lively music]
