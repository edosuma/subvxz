13:11.375 --> 13:12.625
If we do this…

13:14.625 --> 13:16.208
it's because she wants to.

13:17.458 --> 13:18.791
She gets to decide.

13:22.791 --> 13:24.291
[Ciri grunting]

13:28.791 --> 13:30.625
[horse whinnying]

13:34.625 --> 13:36.083
[woman] Get off my daughter!

13:36.583 --> 13:38.250
Leave her alone, now!

13:38.333 --> 13:40.916
You cannot do this! Stop!

13:41.000 --> 13:41.875
[sobbing] No!

13:41.958 --> 13:44.375
-[girl] Mummy, don't let them take me!
-[mother] It's okay!

13:44.458 --> 13:45.958
-[mother] Give her back.
-[girl] Mummy!

13:46.041 --> 13:47.583
-Get your hands off my daughter!
-Mummy!

13:47.666 --> 13:49.416
-[man] Dirty little--
-[mother] No, stop!

13:49.500 --> 13:51.541
[speaking in Elder]

13:52.583 --> 13:55.333
[repeating spell]

13:56.166 --> 13:58.750
[old woman] Your power, you need it.

13:58.833 --> 14:00.833
[overlapping voices]
All you have to do is ask.

14:00.916 --> 14:01.791
No!

14:02.708 --> 14:04.666
[speaking in Elder]

14:04.750 --> 14:07.916
[repeating spell]

14:10.541 --> 14:13.125
[prostitute] Oi!
What's wrong with your hand?

14:13.208 --> 14:14.791
-[mother sobbing] No!
-Nothing.

14:16.916 --> 14:17.833
My friend?

14:17.916 --> 14:19.458
No one by the name of Jaskier.

14:21.500 --> 14:23.291
Oh, I feel you, sister.

14:25.500 --> 14:26.541
Frequent any taverns?

14:29.083 --> 14:30.625
-Huh?
-Just sayin'.

14:30.708 --> 14:31.875
From experience.

14:32.416 --> 14:36.000
When I lose a man, he's usually back
at the first place I found him.

14:36.541 --> 14:37.750
Bottom of a bottle.

14:44.041 --> 14:45.750
[breathing shakily]

14:49.250 --> 14:51.708
[Rience] I'll be honest,
I wasn't expecting this.

14:52.375 --> 14:53.333
[Jaskier whimpers]

14:53.416 --> 14:56.125
You're so tight-lipped
about your old friend the witcher.

14:56.750 --> 14:59.750
My lips are loose. You can ask anybody.

15:00.250 --> 15:02.458
-[sniffles]
-Shall we try a different technique?

15:02.541 --> 15:03.833
[laughs]

15:03.916 --> 15:04.791
Yeah.

15:05.333 --> 15:07.833
You know, I was just thinking about this,
and I, uh…

15:07.916 --> 15:09.625
I don't think it's your technique.

15:09.708 --> 15:12.250
I've not seen Geralt in months.

15:12.333 --> 15:14.666
Not since he abandoned me in Cairngorn,

15:14.750 --> 15:17.750
much-- much like he abandoned
his Child Surprise

15:17.833 --> 15:20.791
who I met only the once,
when she was still in the womb.

15:20.875 --> 15:25.666
I don't know where they are,
I don't know where they're going,

15:25.750 --> 15:28.625
and I don't know
why you're doing this to me!

15:29.125 --> 15:32.250
-It's such a shame you can't be useful.
-[gasps and sniffles]

15:32.833 --> 15:36.000
See, people think Chaos comes
from nothing, but that's wrong.

15:37.583 --> 15:39.666
No, to draw it, you need a source.

15:40.791 --> 15:42.125
[whimpers]

15:42.208 --> 15:44.000
See, fire is a forbidden source

15:44.083 --> 15:46.708
because it usually consumes
those that draw from it.

15:48.291 --> 15:49.916
Unless you're very talented.

15:51.583 --> 15:53.708
-Then the body can withstand it.
-[mumbles]

15:55.666 --> 15:58.958
-Mm-mm.
-But it consumes the soul.

15:59.041 --> 16:00.291
[Jaskier moans]

16:00.375 --> 16:01.750
[screams]

16:01.833 --> 16:04.708
-[laughs]
-Please, I don't know anything!

16:04.791 --> 16:06.041
No, no, no, no.

16:06.750 --> 16:09.291
The songs in your catalog
would suggest otherwise.

16:09.375 --> 16:11.166
[yells]

16:11.250 --> 16:13.375
Listen to me, please! Please listen to me.

16:13.458 --> 16:15.291
I-- I am a bard.

16:15.375 --> 16:17.666
[laughs] I am brilliant.

16:17.750 --> 16:19.333
This is what I do.

16:19.416 --> 16:22.250
He grunts, and I tell stories.

16:22.333 --> 16:23.625
He mentions a witcher keep,

16:23.708 --> 16:27.791
and I turn it into a magical,
mystical hideaway in the mountains.

16:27.875 --> 16:30.250
So please listen to me
when I tell you this.

16:30.333 --> 16:32.583
-He doesn't share details.
-Hmm.

16:33.291 --> 16:35.625
He does not have friends.

16:36.541 --> 16:38.250
And he does not…

16:38.333 --> 16:40.708
[screaming] …have weaknesses!

16:42.291 --> 16:43.333
[glass smashes]

16:43.416 --> 16:44.791
[Jaskier laughs]

16:46.083 --> 16:48.916
[slurring] I knew I'd find you here.
You lazy lout.

16:49.000 --> 16:50.166
[hiccups]

16:50.250 --> 16:52.041
Leaving me at home to rot!

16:52.125 --> 16:54.708
Uh… uh… This is-- this is my wife.
She has nothing to do with this.

16:54.791 --> 16:57.666
-Please let her go--
-If you know what's good for you, leave.

16:58.250 --> 16:59.083
Now.

17:02.208 --> 17:03.041
[whispers] Yeah.

17:03.125 --> 17:05.083
If you knew what's good for you,

17:05.166 --> 17:07.166
you'd shut the fuck up. [hiccups]

17:09.041 --> 17:09.958
Have it your way.

17:10.041 --> 17:12.916
No, no! No, please! Don't hurt her!
Leave her alone, please!

17:13.000 --> 17:14.125
She's done nothing!

17:14.791 --> 17:16.250
Oh, gods!

17:16.333 --> 17:18.333
[screaming]

17:20.791 --> 17:22.083
[both gasping]

17:24.916 --> 17:26.875
-[Yennefer] Come on!
-[Jaskier groans]

17:28.000 --> 17:29.000
Oh fuck!

17:42.958 --> 17:44.458
[Istredd] Oh shit.

18:06.750 --> 18:10.958
It takes generations of erosion
to even make a dent in stellacite. This…

18:12.458 --> 18:14.375
this is a scientific revelation.

18:14.458 --> 18:17.458
It-- it defies
every historical precedent, Witcher.

18:17.541 --> 18:18.750
This changes everything.

18:19.333 --> 18:22.000
I was expecting tracks. Bones.

18:23.708 --> 18:24.583
Anything.

18:25.541 --> 18:27.791
-I have to go down there.
-We have to go down there.

18:34.000 --> 18:35.375
[blade being sharpened]

18:48.333 --> 18:49.166
Thirsty?

18:56.041 --> 18:56.916
[Ciri] Thanks.

19:01.916 --> 19:04.041
I thought you were gonna be a spoiled,

19:04.125 --> 19:06.666
high-bred, drip-nosed royal from the West.

19:07.750 --> 19:09.625
-And you are.
-[men chuckle]

19:12.333 --> 19:13.416
But…

19:14.166 --> 19:16.041
you're impressing all of us out there.

19:19.250 --> 19:21.416
Not enough to join Geralt in Cintra.

19:22.458 --> 19:24.000
You think you should have been invited?

19:25.833 --> 19:27.083
Well, it's my home.

19:31.875 --> 19:33.083
My fight.

19:35.875 --> 19:36.916
My life.

19:40.583 --> 19:41.958
I need to show you something.

19:50.000 --> 19:51.875
When the Conjunction happened,

19:51.958 --> 19:55.666
it wasn't just the elves, humans, dwarves.

19:55.750 --> 19:58.166
Spheres of beasts collided too.

20:00.083 --> 20:02.333
Mages weaponized monsters.

20:02.958 --> 20:05.375
Tried to conquer the lands with them.

20:05.916 --> 20:07.333
Fucking idiots.

20:08.750 --> 20:11.375
Of course,
the monsters destroyed everything.

20:11.458 --> 20:14.083
Then, 300 years ago,

20:14.583 --> 20:15.958
mages weaponized men.

20:16.666 --> 20:18.625
Mutated them with elixirs.

20:18.708 --> 20:20.791
Made them faster. Stronger.

20:21.416 --> 20:23.166
Brutal enough to kill the beasts.

20:23.750 --> 20:27.041
The witchers saved humanity
from extinction.

20:30.583 --> 20:33.541
Do you know why
there are fewer of us each winter, Ciri?

20:35.416 --> 20:37.958
Because when Kaer Morhen was destroyed,

20:38.041 --> 20:41.083
so was the mutagen
that allowed us to make new witchers.

20:43.125 --> 20:44.750
But I think you can help.

20:48.125 --> 20:50.041
Ever heard of feainnewedd?

20:51.833 --> 20:53.500
It's an ancient flower.

20:53.583 --> 20:55.333
Only grows one place.

20:55.833 --> 20:57.791
Where Elder blood has spilled.

21:04.291 --> 21:06.833
These have been sprouting
all over the training course.

21:06.916 --> 21:07.875
Yeah.

21:14.833 --> 21:16.208
[softly] Where I've bled.

21:22.375 --> 21:25.166
But my-- my grandmother,
she hated the elves.

21:25.750 --> 21:26.833
[exhales gently]

21:26.916 --> 21:28.666
Sometimes our deepest hate

21:28.750 --> 21:31.708
is for the things
we cannot change about ourselves.

21:49.125 --> 21:50.041
[sighs]

21:51.333 --> 21:53.625
Something bad is brewing out there.

21:54.625 --> 21:58.083
With a vial of your blood,
we could protect generations to come.

22:01.250 --> 22:03.208
How are you so sure it will work?

22:04.833 --> 22:05.916
I'm not.

22:07.166 --> 22:08.416
Ah…

22:13.250 --> 22:14.125
I'll do it.

22:15.958 --> 22:17.208
On one condition.

22:19.958 --> 22:21.666
You have to test it on me first.

22:23.750 --> 22:24.916
[screams]

22:28.083 --> 22:28.958
Forget it.

22:33.791 --> 22:34.625
Come.

22:39.833 --> 22:41.583
My men are warriors now.

22:45.666 --> 22:47.583
But they were boys in pain once.

22:48.666 --> 22:50.250
If they even survived.

22:51.000 --> 22:52.166
And not many did.

22:53.500 --> 22:55.125
I'll not take that chance with you.

22:56.000 --> 22:57.083
Because I'm a girl?

22:57.583 --> 22:59.375
Because you're Geralt's child.

22:59.875 --> 23:01.375
[scoffs] I'm not a child.

23:01.958 --> 23:05.500
-Because we care about you.
-And I care about all of you!

23:07.291 --> 23:08.750
You said it yourself!

23:11.208 --> 23:12.458
Witchers are dying.

23:13.541 --> 23:14.916
[whispers] One by one.

23:15.708 --> 23:16.708
You'll fight.

23:17.958 --> 23:19.000
You'll die.

23:20.791 --> 23:23.375
And all of those boys' suffering
will have been for nothing.

23:23.458 --> 23:24.375
[grunts]

23:25.166 --> 23:26.000
[growls]

23:31.541 --> 23:33.000
[whispers] I've destroyed

23:33.750 --> 23:35.291
so many things.

23:37.333 --> 23:38.583
Please, just…

23:39.541 --> 23:41.291
let me help heal something for once.

23:44.916 --> 23:46.166
I'm meant for this.

23:53.041 --> 23:54.458
[Geralt] There's no nest.

23:54.958 --> 23:57.041
There's no evidence
they've been here at all.

23:57.125 --> 23:58.208
Unbelievable.

23:59.375 --> 24:01.541
How could this happen? What could do this?

24:02.750 --> 24:03.583
Monsters.

24:03.666 --> 24:04.958
Explain.

24:06.208 --> 24:10.458
Historians have always theorized that
monoliths are scars from the Conjunction.

24:10.541 --> 24:12.291
Leftover points of impact.

24:13.083 --> 24:15.625
-Yes. I have read books before.
-Well, think about it.

24:15.708 --> 24:19.125
Monsters didn't exist
on this plane before the Conjunction.

24:19.625 --> 24:21.708
All species were separated
on different spheres

24:21.791 --> 24:23.916
till those spheres merged into one.

24:24.000 --> 24:26.375
A Conjunction like that
would've required two things.

24:26.458 --> 24:27.958
A massive surge of energy

24:28.041 --> 24:30.083
and-- and conduits to channel it.

24:30.166 --> 24:33.125
Now, what if
the monoliths aren't points of impact?

24:34.041 --> 24:35.333
What if they're the conduits?

24:40.625 --> 24:42.875
I worry about you mages more and more.

24:42.958 --> 24:44.583
[wind whistling]

24:44.666 --> 24:47.666
Perhaps humans
just shouldn't live for so long.

24:48.291 --> 24:50.958
-I've seen them communicating.
-Hmm.

24:53.125 --> 24:54.416
[thunder rumbling]

24:54.500 --> 24:55.791
[sighs]

24:57.791 --> 25:00.583
[Istredd] You say this monolith toppled
during the Slaughter of Cintra.

25:00.666 --> 25:03.458
-That makes perfect sense.
-[Geralt] And yet it doesn't.

25:04.458 --> 25:06.458
[liquid dripping]

25:49.541 --> 25:51.250
[speaking in Elder]

25:57.166 --> 25:58.750
[Triss continues speaking in Elder]

26:09.875 --> 26:12.208
[softly] Did it… did it work?

26:20.875 --> 26:21.916
It worked.

26:23.708 --> 26:25.041
[sighs]

26:28.708 --> 26:30.375
I just need a moment to prepare.

26:31.541 --> 26:32.375
[Triss] Prepare?

26:34.791 --> 26:36.916
-For what?
-She wants to be the first.

26:38.708 --> 26:40.833
-The first?
-New witcher.

26:41.708 --> 26:42.625
It was her choice.

26:47.166 --> 26:48.291
[laughs]

26:48.375 --> 26:51.458
-[gasps] Who the fuck was that?
-How should I know?

26:51.541 --> 26:54.916
-You're the one he kidnapped.
-You mages don't all share an alma mater?

26:55.000 --> 26:57.458
-You didn't catch him at an alumni event?
-I was looking forward

26:57.541 --> 26:59.875
to a few more thank yous,
perhaps some genuflection.

26:59.958 --> 27:01.000
He's after Geralt.

27:01.583 --> 27:03.833
What? Why? What does he want with him?

27:03.916 --> 27:06.291
You know, I assumed
it was to drink tea and eat crumpets

27:06.375 --> 27:08.458
and wax nostalgic over old times.

27:08.541 --> 27:09.958
I don't know, Yennefer.

27:10.041 --> 27:12.750
So why don't you conjure up a portal

27:12.833 --> 27:15.041
or do your mind talking and warn him?

27:15.125 --> 27:16.291
You owe him that.

27:16.375 --> 27:19.708
I owe him as much as he owes me.
Nothing more, nothing less.

27:19.791 --> 27:21.166
Anyway, I can't.

27:21.708 --> 27:23.000
No magic, remember?

27:23.625 --> 27:26.750
-Fuck!
-You don't get to play damsel in distress.

27:27.875 --> 27:29.375
[sighs] That's my job.

27:30.625 --> 27:32.208
-What's going on here?
-Uh, gentlemen.

27:32.291 --> 27:34.916
Good morning. Good to see you.
You're certainly looming.

27:35.000 --> 27:37.375
-Um…
-Ah, are we working this morning, love?

27:37.958 --> 27:39.458
-[groans]
-[Jaskier] Ohh!

27:39.541 --> 27:41.791
-[man moans]
-Oh, she's so scary.

27:42.291 --> 27:43.458
[man] Come 'ere!

27:43.541 --> 27:45.291
This way. This way. Run. Run.

27:45.375 --> 27:46.666
-Oi!
-Oi, you. Stop!

27:46.750 --> 27:47.875
[groans]

27:47.958 --> 27:49.166
You stop there!

27:49.250 --> 27:50.208
Uh, that way. Go!

27:50.291 --> 27:53.583
Gentlemen, gentlemen, many men
have wanted to punch me in the face.

27:53.666 --> 27:56.041
Now is your chance! Come on!

27:58.916 --> 28:00.791
-[man 1] Stop!
-[man 2] Come back 'ere!

28:01.375 --> 28:03.166
-[grunts]
-[man 1] Come on, lads!

28:03.875 --> 28:05.541
-Move!
-[man 2] Where?

28:05.625 --> 28:07.000
[man 1] Head down there!

28:08.000 --> 28:09.541
Oi! This way!

28:10.041 --> 28:11.000
[man 1] We'll find you!

28:12.125 --> 28:13.500
-In there!
-There she is!

28:13.583 --> 28:14.416
No good hiding!

28:14.500 --> 28:15.708
-We'll find you.
-Thank you.

28:15.791 --> 28:17.625
-[banging]
-Open the fucking door!

28:17.708 --> 28:18.833
[guard] You're ours now.

28:18.916 --> 28:20.458
[man 2] Open this door now!

28:20.541 --> 28:23.041
[prostitute] Sorry, love.
A girl's gotta eat.

28:23.125 --> 28:24.166
[banging continues]

28:24.250 --> 28:26.250
[water splashing]

28:31.166 --> 28:33.166
[footsteps]

28:35.125 --> 28:36.541
[door opens]

28:37.083 --> 28:38.583
What are you doing?

28:40.000 --> 28:42.666
I know you know how dangerous this is.

28:43.666 --> 28:44.958
I'm not afraid.

28:45.041 --> 28:46.625
Have you thought about Geralt?

28:47.500 --> 28:48.625
What he'd say?

28:50.625 --> 28:52.750
Why do you want this so badly, Ciri?

29:01.500 --> 29:03.666
Because I am sick of feeling lost.

29:05.750 --> 29:08.041
Everything I was told my whole life

29:08.625 --> 29:09.625
was a lie.

29:11.375 --> 29:14.416
And the people I loved most
in this world were taken from me

29:14.500 --> 29:16.041
before I could find the truth.

29:17.041 --> 29:19.333
What you're doing
won't change any of that.

29:20.083 --> 29:23.541
But it might help me find a new truth.

29:29.875 --> 29:32.833
Maybe there's another way
to find out where your powers came from.

29:36.166 --> 29:37.208
What, you…

29:37.291 --> 29:39.750
you mean like you did with the myriapod?

29:39.833 --> 29:41.958
Slightly less scientific than that.

29:43.375 --> 29:44.875
It's called a Dol Durza.

29:45.750 --> 29:48.625
It translates roughly
to Valley of the Soul.

29:49.666 --> 29:52.916
It allows me to enter the deepest layer
of your consciousness

29:53.000 --> 29:54.791
and uncover things
that may be hidden there.

29:55.458 --> 29:59.000
Genetic memories
that tell the story of who you really are.

29:59.083 --> 30:00.583
Where you really come from.

30:01.541 --> 30:03.416
Is… It's dangerous?

30:03.500 --> 30:06.458
No. It just requires
that we trust each other.

30:17.041 --> 30:18.083
All right, then.

30:22.458 --> 30:23.625
Clear your mind.

30:24.208 --> 30:26.625
Take three deep breaths.

30:32.500 --> 30:35.916
[speaking in Elder]

30:37.208 --> 30:39.291
[voice echoing]

30:40.958 --> 30:42.083
[exhales]

30:42.166 --> 30:43.125
[whispering sounds]

30:43.208 --> 30:44.958
[gasps]

30:56.708 --> 30:57.583
How?

30:59.000 --> 30:59.958
Trust.

31:03.375 --> 31:06.125
Come on, then, Lambchop!
It's my turn now!

31:06.208 --> 31:07.708
[yelling]

31:09.208 --> 31:10.708
[laughter]

31:13.166 --> 31:16.166
[Dara] You bring terror
and you bring death wherever you are!

31:16.250 --> 31:17.583
[echoes] …wherever you are…

31:18.708 --> 31:21.000
[woman 1] Ma'am,
a present from His Majesty.

31:22.708 --> 31:24.583
[Calanthe] Tell Eist I love it.

31:24.666 --> 31:26.875
[woman 2] A fine sash for a fine queen.

31:29.375 --> 31:30.541
[Ciri gasps]

31:31.875 --> 31:33.875
[overlapping voices echoing]

31:36.125 --> 31:37.250
Come on, watch him.

31:37.333 --> 31:38.750
[raucous laughter]

31:45.625 --> 31:47.666
-[gasping]
-Don't be afraid.

31:48.166 --> 31:49.708
Nothing can hurt you here.

31:50.333 --> 31:53.333
All of this, it's just… it's you.

31:54.375 --> 31:55.500
[boy laughs]

31:58.166 --> 31:59.666
[children laughing]

32:08.208 --> 32:10.125
[boy] There's no way you can get five.

32:10.916 --> 32:13.625
[Ciri] You're not taking a bite
of that bread before I try it.

32:14.125 --> 32:15.916
[Pavetta] We've been right here.

32:17.083 --> 32:18.416
The whole time.

32:18.500 --> 32:20.000
[echoes] …the whole time…

32:25.208 --> 32:27.208
[whispering voices overlapping]

32:29.708 --> 32:30.666
Mother.

32:30.750 --> 32:31.916
[whooshing]

32:32.791 --> 32:33.916
Would you like a story?

32:34.000 --> 32:35.458
[echoes] …like a story…

32:36.166 --> 32:37.583
You can see us.

32:39.500 --> 32:40.583
What's wrong?

32:41.250 --> 32:43.000
This isn't how it's supposed to work.

32:43.083 --> 32:46.666
Come on, Ciri, let's go back.
You've had enough.

32:46.750 --> 32:47.833
[echoes] …enough…

32:50.250 --> 32:51.250
[door opens]

32:51.333 --> 32:52.458
[creaking]

32:54.500 --> 32:56.041
[distant wailing]

32:57.125 --> 32:58.666
[baby crying]

32:59.833 --> 33:01.833
[cries echoing]

33:06.833 --> 33:08.833
This isn't how
it's supposed to work at all.

33:08.916 --> 33:10.166
[rats squeaking]

33:14.291 --> 33:15.416
[Pavetta, muffled] Hush.

33:15.916 --> 33:19.375
Hush now, and Mummy will tell you a story.

33:20.916 --> 33:22.916
[low murmuring]

33:28.083 --> 33:29.833
-[creaking]
-[baby gurgling]

33:35.166 --> 33:36.625
They'd kill her if they knew.

33:37.166 --> 33:38.208
It's a prophecy.

33:38.291 --> 33:39.916
Maybe it's not true.

33:40.000 --> 33:41.708
[Duny] It doesn't matter if it's true.

33:41.791 --> 33:44.416
It only matters if the people believe it.

33:46.625 --> 33:47.750
And they will.

33:55.583 --> 33:57.083
[low rumbling]

33:59.125 --> 34:00.208
The boat's ready.

34:02.625 --> 34:05.125
We can leave under the cover of darkness.

34:08.791 --> 34:10.458
This is the night they died.

34:12.541 --> 34:13.541
My parents.

34:14.666 --> 34:15.625
[gasps]

34:17.125 --> 34:19.583
-Ciri, come on.
-Wait. I don't want to leave them yet.

34:19.666 --> 34:21.250
[Triss] Something isn't right.

34:22.333 --> 34:23.208
[gasps]

34:27.333 --> 34:29.666
[overlapping voices] What are you, child?

34:30.208 --> 34:31.791
[whispering] Cirilla.

34:34.166 --> 34:36.666
Ciri.

34:38.791 --> 34:41.208
Ciri.

34:47.583 --> 34:50.375
-Ciri.
-Ciri.

34:53.958 --> 34:55.791
Ciri.

34:57.583 --> 34:59.583
[whispering voices continuing]

35:04.125 --> 35:06.375
[Istredd] I was at a dig
in Nazair a while back.

35:06.458 --> 35:07.875
I-- I witnessed something.

35:07.958 --> 35:11.333
There was this monolith
started emitting strange vibrations,

35:11.416 --> 35:13.833
like it was channeling
a massive energy surge.

35:13.916 --> 35:17.041
It only lasted a few seconds,
but look. Look, look at the date.

35:17.916 --> 35:20.208
It happened the night Cintra fell.
The same night as this.

35:21.541 --> 35:22.916
[thunder rumbling]

35:23.000 --> 35:25.625
You think
this is where the energy surge originated.

35:25.708 --> 35:29.000
Which activated the conduit system.
The monoliths started talking.

35:30.166 --> 35:32.083
What does that have to do with monsters?

35:34.291 --> 35:38.000
It wasn't a Conjunction.
At least, not how we've been thinking.

35:38.083 --> 35:40.625
The other spheres didn't merge, they…

35:41.208 --> 35:43.375
they collided, then separated again.

35:44.541 --> 35:47.041
If the original spheres
are still out there somewhere

35:47.541 --> 35:49.625
and our monoliths are calling to them…

35:51.291 --> 35:54.500
then the monsters aren't new,
they're just new to here.

35:57.458 --> 35:59.875
And they're using our monoliths
as gateways.

35:59.958 --> 36:01.958
[thunder crashing]

36:12.291 --> 36:13.333
Where are we?

36:14.875 --> 36:16.166
I don't know.

36:20.666 --> 36:22.083
[baby crying]

36:28.666 --> 36:31.625
[Istredd] Tell me how you knew
that monsters and monoliths were linked.

36:32.666 --> 36:34.541
[Geralt] What is it you're hoping to hear?

36:36.500 --> 36:37.333
Your agenda.

36:38.291 --> 36:40.875
If you have information
that could advance our civilization,

36:40.958 --> 36:44.125
-I have a right to know.
-Why? So you can help the elves?

36:46.083 --> 36:47.333
[wind whistling]

36:47.416 --> 36:48.416
[sighs]

36:48.958 --> 36:51.875
I came to Cintra
'cause I thought someone might be here.

36:51.958 --> 36:53.625
-A woman.
-Hmph.

36:54.208 --> 36:55.250
Yennefer.

36:57.916 --> 36:59.083
[thunder rumbling]

37:00.833 --> 37:01.666
Yennefer?

37:02.416 --> 37:03.250
Mmm.

37:04.125 --> 37:06.208
-Of…
-Of Vengerberg?

37:09.416 --> 37:10.500
You know Yenna?

37:11.208 --> 37:12.041
Yen.

37:13.500 --> 37:14.500
I did.

37:16.541 --> 37:17.375
Yes.

37:19.916 --> 37:22.083
-Me too.
-[thunder crashing]

37:26.083 --> 37:26.958
You loved her.

37:27.625 --> 37:29.250
Love. I never stopped.

37:31.250 --> 37:34.916
I thought after Sodden, after everything
they did to her at Aretuza, she--

37:35.416 --> 37:37.750
she would make her way here for refuge.

37:39.166 --> 37:40.958
After Sodden?

37:42.291 --> 37:44.875
After she burned through Nilfgaard's army
and saved the Continent.

37:44.958 --> 37:46.333
We should all be praising her name.

37:50.125 --> 37:51.166
Yen's alive?

37:52.958 --> 37:54.333
[baby crying]

37:56.208 --> 37:58.375
[woman singing]

38:06.583 --> 38:08.583
-[singing]
-[baby crying]

38:24.583 --> 38:26.000
Do you know who she is?

38:28.000 --> 38:28.833
No.

38:31.291 --> 38:32.375
Very well.

38:33.875 --> 38:36.208
I will tell you the story
of the elven warrior

38:37.708 --> 38:39.458
made to kill the human invader.

38:40.333 --> 38:42.250
The human she fell in love with.

38:43.416 --> 38:44.416
Nivellen's story.

38:45.416 --> 38:47.375
-[whooshing]
-[gasping]

38:47.458 --> 38:48.958
-[cracking]
-[Ciri] She's dying.

38:49.041 --> 38:50.916
-[woman gasping]
-[baby crying]

38:56.291 --> 38:57.875
[Triss speaking in Elder]

38:57.958 --> 38:59.750
You could have united our races.

39:00.416 --> 39:02.458
And now, my sweet daughter…

39:02.541 --> 39:04.541
[deep voice overlaps]
…you will destroy them.

39:04.625 --> 39:07.750
-[gasping] Ciri!
-[voices overlapping] You cannot help us.

39:08.291 --> 39:09.750
-[rumbling]
-[Triss] Ciri!

39:09.833 --> 39:11.333
-[whooshing]
-Help!

39:12.250 --> 39:14.625
-[choking]
-Child of Elder blood,

39:14.708 --> 39:15.833
child of wrath.

39:15.916 --> 39:18.000
-The time of contempt is nigh.
-[rumbling]

39:18.833 --> 39:22.208
The world will die amidst frost
and be reborn of the new sun.

39:22.708 --> 39:23.708
Reborn of Elder blood,

39:24.500 --> 39:26.583
of the seed that has been sown.

39:26.666 --> 39:29.916
A seed that will not sprout,
but will burst into flame.

39:30.000 --> 39:31.208
[Triss screams]

39:31.291 --> 39:32.750
[intense rumbling]

39:34.666 --> 39:36.125
[horses neighing]

39:42.000 --> 39:43.166
Ciri!

39:44.625 --> 39:45.833
Geralt!

39:45.916 --> 39:48.125
[echoing] Geralt!

39:48.208 --> 39:51.041
Geralt! Geralt!

39:52.041 --> 39:53.541
Geralt!

39:54.125 --> 39:56.625
Geralt! Geralt!

39:56.708 --> 39:58.333
[rumbling]

40:02.125 --> 40:03.416

40:12.083 --> 40:13.583
-[coughing]
-Triss! Triss!

40:14.083 --> 40:15.333
[gasping]

40:15.833 --> 40:16.833
-Triss.
-No! No!

40:16.916 --> 40:19.458
-Let me help you.
-No, no, no! [groans]

40:19.541 --> 40:20.958
[whispers] Something is ending.

40:22.375 --> 40:23.583
It's because of you.

40:23.666 --> 40:24.916
[gasping]

40:25.458 --> 40:27.458
A seed that bursts into flame.

40:28.583 --> 40:29.916
It's you.

40:31.125 --> 40:32.666
You will destroy us all.

40:33.375 --> 40:34.458
I saw it.

40:35.541 --> 40:37.166
[shuddering]

40:38.208 --> 40:39.708
No one can stop it.

40:39.791 --> 40:41.375
[panting]

40:42.166 --> 40:43.541
[Triss] Not even him.

40:44.625 --> 40:46.958
[sobbing]

40:54.333 --> 40:58.083
[Istredd] Where did those stellacite
fragments go? Whose voice was that?

40:58.166 --> 40:59.166
Quiet.

40:59.250 --> 41:00.833
[clinking and creaking sounds]

41:01.458 --> 41:02.791
[faint roaring]

41:02.875 --> 41:03.958
[Istredd] What is it?

41:06.500 --> 41:07.916
[growling]

41:08.791 --> 41:10.625
-[hoofbeats]
-[deep rumbling]

41:12.708 --> 41:14.375

41:17.291 --> 41:18.791

41:19.791 --> 41:21.333

41:22.583 --> 41:23.875

41:23.958 --> 41:26.250
[thundering steps]

41:28.041 --> 41:29.333
[chitters]

41:32.833 --> 41:34.625
[growls and screeches]

41:34.708 --> 41:35.541
[Geralt] Fuck.

41:38.083 --> 41:39.833
Who is the girl who called to you?

41:40.458 --> 41:42.291
And what the hell was that thing?

41:42.875 --> 41:45.916
-Do you think Nilfgaard knows about this?
-Open a portal.

41:47.375 --> 41:48.208
Now.

41:51.958 --> 41:54.250
Vesemir, I want it done. Now.

42:18.291 --> 42:19.541
[Vesemir] Geralt.

42:27.166 --> 42:28.125
Are you certain?

42:32.416 --> 42:33.583
[sighs]

42:34.750 --> 42:35.916
[sighs]

42:40.375 --> 42:41.583
[Geralt[] What are you doing?

42:42.958 --> 42:45.500
-Geralt.
-She's meant to be. To rebuild us.

42:45.583 --> 42:46.625
She is not.

42:47.208 --> 42:49.625
She's a girl. All you'll do is poison her.

42:49.708 --> 42:52.708
-She can do this.
-I made him do it, Geralt.

42:53.208 --> 42:56.125
Stop. I wanted him to try. Geralt, stop!

42:56.208 --> 42:59.458
Did you not think of the consequences?
What if you were killed?

43:00.125 --> 43:01.041
Stop.

43:01.666 --> 43:02.625
Stop!

43:03.708 --> 43:05.625
All I ever think about are consequences.

43:05.708 --> 43:07.583
No matter how hard I train,

43:07.666 --> 43:10.083
no matter what I do,
it'll never be enough.

43:10.166 --> 43:12.166
You are already enough, Cirilla.

43:14.458 --> 43:15.708
You are extraordinary.

43:19.666 --> 43:21.333
[whispers] I want to be like you,

43:22.250 --> 43:23.083
Geralt.

43:25.083 --> 43:28.166
I want to be indifferent to the past.

43:29.000 --> 43:29.833
To the lies.

43:30.500 --> 43:32.875
-To the things I've done.
-[sighs]

43:34.875 --> 43:35.875
Please.

43:41.500 --> 43:42.708
Let me have that.

43:42.791 --> 43:44.000
[breathing shakily]

43:46.625 --> 43:48.541
That is not how it works.

43:50.250 --> 43:54.250
Neither you nor I
can just forget who we are.

43:55.333 --> 43:57.375
We can't kill our feelings.

43:58.541 --> 43:59.916
Our best chance

44:00.875 --> 44:03.666
is to kill the hatred
that we may hold onto…

44:06.375 --> 44:07.375
and move on.

44:17.250 --> 44:18.250
[chain rattles]

44:18.333 --> 44:19.375
[Ciri shudders]

44:22.208 --> 44:24.041
[unfastens strap]

44:35.833 --> 44:37.333
Go and get your things.

44:57.916 --> 44:59.333
[sighs]

45:03.791 --> 45:06.333
[Istredd] Is that
what Calanthe was protecting?

45:06.416 --> 45:09.458
[sighs] What did she know?
What does all this mean?

45:11.416 --> 45:12.833
[sighs]

45:16.791 --> 45:17.916
[groans]

45:20.250 --> 45:21.833
Apologies, King Roegner.

45:24.625 --> 45:25.500
[sighs]

45:46.541 --> 45:48.041
[whispers] Cintra…

45:49.458 --> 45:50.541
Calanthe.

45:54.083 --> 45:55.458
Why does it stop?

45:55.958 --> 45:57.708
Ah, it doesn't make any sense.

45:59.083 --> 46:00.958
[grunts] What does this all mean?

46:03.208 --> 46:04.750
-[woman screaming]
-[waves rushing]

46:04.833 --> 46:06.625
-[ship creaking]
-[child crying]

46:09.791 --> 46:11.541
[coughing]

46:16.625 --> 46:18.208
[screams]

46:24.250 --> 46:26.000
[wave crashes]

46:26.083 --> 46:27.583
[panting]

46:57.708 --> 46:58.791
You wished to see me?

46:59.291 --> 47:01.583
There are fewer and fewer new arrivals.

47:02.750 --> 47:06.708
I received word
that guards have begun boarding ships.

47:06.791 --> 47:09.916
Even in Oxenfurt,
and they've always been on our side.

47:10.000 --> 47:12.000
We-- we need to find an alternative.

47:12.500 --> 47:13.416
I am.

47:15.000 --> 47:16.541
I didn't mean to alarm you, I just…

47:17.416 --> 47:19.458
I want you to have
all the information I do.

47:19.541 --> 47:20.666
So that we can…

47:22.083 --> 47:23.416
we can be in step with each other.

47:24.916 --> 47:26.375
[footsteps in hallway]

47:27.166 --> 47:28.000
What?

47:28.958 --> 47:31.916
Nothing. It's just
I've had leaders, followers,

47:33.791 --> 47:34.625
but…

47:35.208 --> 47:37.125
I've never had a partner before.

47:40.208 --> 47:41.333
Neither have I.

47:44.166 --> 47:45.500
It's not terrible.

47:46.083 --> 47:47.250
[both laugh]

47:50.666 --> 47:51.791
[Fringilla] Mmm.

47:51.875 --> 47:53.416
The next ship is due soon.

47:54.333 --> 47:55.166
Come.

47:56.250 --> 47:58.583
I want my people to meet their liberator.

48:19.125 --> 48:20.166
Your papers.

48:20.666 --> 48:21.500
What?

48:21.583 --> 48:23.125
Stand in line with the others.

48:23.625 --> 48:25.541
-[horse neighs]
-[goat bleats]

48:28.708 --> 48:29.541
[man] Name.

48:29.625 --> 48:32.375
-[guard] Have your papers ready!
-Cormeth from Oxenfurt.

48:34.000 --> 48:34.916
Welcome.

48:36.833 --> 48:37.750
Name!

48:38.875 --> 48:41.166
Dara, of the Marble Gardens.

48:45.708 --> 48:47.000
Welcome back to your land, son.

48:49.625 --> 48:50.500
Name.

48:53.375 --> 48:55.750
You must declare yourself
before entering Xin'trea.

48:55.833 --> 48:57.750
-Stand aside.
-Fall back in line!

48:57.833 --> 49:00.500
-I said stand aside.
-Perhaps you didn't hear.

49:02.125 --> 49:04.250
There's no entry until you report.

49:04.833 --> 49:05.708
So who are you?

49:07.166 --> 49:10.916
I am Commander Mawr Dyffryn aep Ceallach.

49:11.875 --> 49:13.583
Who the fuck are you?

49:13.666 --> 49:14.625
[Fringilla] Cahir!

49:17.750 --> 49:18.833
Welcome home.

49:20.416 --> 49:21.833
Good to see you alive.

49:33.000 --> 49:36.125
[old woman] Your friends are faring
so much better than you.

49:36.708 --> 49:38.833
One has command,

49:38.916 --> 49:40.208
the other hope.

49:41.291 --> 49:43.500
[man] This is bullshit.
I saw her go in the door.

49:43.583 --> 49:45.208
Oh, shit.

49:45.291 --> 49:47.708
You can't do this.
We've earned that reward.

49:48.291 --> 49:51.291
You wouldn't even have
that traitorous mage if it wasn't for us.

49:51.375 --> 49:52.916
[soldier] Reward's already been claimed.

49:53.000 --> 49:55.500
[old woman] You know
what you need, Piglet.

49:55.583 --> 49:57.166
[whispering voices]

49:57.250 --> 49:59.166
Your magic.

49:59.708 --> 50:00.750
Now fuck off!

50:01.375 --> 50:02.458
All right, all right!

50:10.541 --> 50:13.000
You're running out of time.

50:13.541 --> 50:15.041
Get your fucking hands off me.

50:15.125 --> 50:17.416
I'm gonna take pleasure in your execution.

50:17.916 --> 50:19.833
Show me what you want.

50:20.958 --> 50:23.333
Heal your wounds.

50:24.125 --> 50:26.500
Fucking… fucky… fuck.

50:27.916 --> 50:30.625
You know the words.

50:30.708 --> 50:31.916
Say them!

50:32.000 --> 50:33.791
Behold the mother of forests,

50:34.291 --> 50:36.625
the Deathless Mother nesting in dreams.

50:37.416 --> 50:39.583
Turn your back to the forest, hut, hut.

50:40.625 --> 50:41.458
Oh!

50:43.208 --> 50:45.416
-Yennefer!
-[man] Ahem.

50:45.500 --> 50:47.416
Peeping Toms get the clink.

50:49.000 --> 50:50.250
Gentlemen! Uh…

50:52.625 --> 50:54.916
[old woman] So good to see you again.

50:56.333 --> 50:58.875
All alone in a world that hates you,

50:58.958 --> 51:01.291
with no way to protect yourself.

51:02.166 --> 51:04.083
How delicious.

51:05.000 --> 51:06.125
I managed.

51:07.166 --> 51:09.416
And yet you're here.

51:10.416 --> 51:12.375
I'm not stupid.
I meant what I said before.

51:12.458 --> 51:14.083
I'm done dealing in debts.

51:14.583 --> 51:16.125
I want to make a trade.

51:16.208 --> 51:17.541
I know what you want.

51:18.458 --> 51:21.583
All that wrath
and righteous anger raging inside you.

51:22.333 --> 51:25.000
I can smell your desires
like rotting meat.

51:25.791 --> 51:28.333
But I'm not here to grant wishes.

51:28.416 --> 51:32.333
I'm simply a guide
to get you exactly what you deserve.

51:33.208 --> 51:34.791
Just ask your friends.

51:34.875 --> 51:36.416
I deserve to survive.

51:37.208 --> 51:40.458
I've earned it. I deserve access to Chaos.

51:40.541 --> 51:42.250
I know how you can get it.

51:42.333 --> 51:43.916
How you can steal it.

51:44.000 --> 51:45.208
[Yennefer] Steal what?

51:48.208 --> 51:49.083
Me.

51:52.875 --> 51:54.083
And who are you?

51:56.791 --> 51:59.875
I'm the key
to you getting your power back.

52:01.000 --> 52:03.541
And a great deal more than that.

52:05.000 --> 52:08.000
All you have to do
is deliver me to the right lock.

52:09.125 --> 52:12.208
A shattered black door
just outside Cintra.
