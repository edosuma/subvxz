WEBVTT

00:11.745 --> 00:13.580
Why do you keep
defending this guy?

00:13.614 --> 00:15.215
Because I like him.

00:15.248 --> 00:17.017
Because he was
my first client ever.

00:17.050 --> 00:18.251
Because he's innocent.

00:18.284 --> 00:19.820
I also have the time

00:19.853 --> 00:21.755
because I didn't get
the asbestos business.

00:21.788 --> 00:23.389
Funny.

00:27.260 --> 00:28.662
Uh, can I help you?

00:28.695 --> 00:29.930
Delores Keplar.

00:29.963 --> 00:31.497
I'd like to hire
an attorney,

00:31.532 --> 00:33.433
the nastiest one
you've got.

00:33.466 --> 00:36.169
That would be
Ellenor Frutt,
but she just left.

00:36.202 --> 00:37.437
What's this regarding?

00:37.470 --> 00:39.873
Divorce. I really
don't want a woman.

00:39.906 --> 00:41.407
I want a...

00:41.441 --> 00:43.510
Well, "dick"
is an offensive word,

00:43.544 --> 00:45.245
but it's the only one
I can think of--

00:45.278 --> 00:47.380
I know what exactly
what you're saying,
and Ellenor Frutt

00:47.413 --> 00:49.049
is definitely what
you're looking for.

00:49.082 --> 00:50.350
Lucy?

00:50.383 --> 00:53.253
Bobby, hi, um,
this is Delores Keplar.

00:53.286 --> 00:55.856
This is Bobby Donnell.
She's looking to hire--

00:55.889 --> 00:57.624
I heard. Hello.

00:57.658 --> 00:59.626
-Donnell.
You're the senior partner?
-Yes.

00:59.660 --> 01:01.695
Yeah, but he's not
nearly as tough as--

01:01.728 --> 01:02.729
Lucy.

01:02.763 --> 01:05.065
We're not exactly
divorce attorneys here--

01:05.098 --> 01:07.400
I know, you're criminal.
That's what I'm looking for:

01:07.433 --> 01:09.135
down and dirty
street fighters.

01:09.169 --> 01:10.637
My husband...

01:10.671 --> 01:13.206
Well, let's just say
I want him to hurt

01:13.239 --> 01:15.776
and I'm willing
to pay for it.

01:16.777 --> 01:17.578
Danny.

01:17.611 --> 01:19.980
Hey, Bobby.
Got a sec?

01:20.013 --> 01:21.081
Kind of important.

01:21.114 --> 01:24.150
-Uh, sure. Mrs...
-Keplar.

01:24.184 --> 01:26.252
Um...

01:29.155 --> 01:32.993
Uh, Jimmy, could you sit
down with Mrs. Keplar?

01:33.026 --> 01:34.094
Sure.

01:34.127 --> 01:36.763
He doesn't look
very mean to me.

01:36.797 --> 01:38.799
You'd be surprised.

01:38.832 --> 01:40.534
Danny.

01:43.003 --> 01:44.805
Hi. Uh, James Berluti.

01:48.174 --> 01:49.810
I'm in a little bit
of a jam.

01:49.843 --> 01:50.844
What's up?

01:50.877 --> 01:52.145
Attorney-client?
Of course.

01:52.178 --> 01:54.147
Long story short.

01:54.180 --> 01:56.316
Woman named Jenny Raines.

01:56.349 --> 01:58.785
Girl, I should say,
she's 16.

01:58.819 --> 02:00.621
Teenage hooker
charged with murder.

02:00.654 --> 02:03.289
Murder? What,
are you slumming
in criminal law now?

02:03.323 --> 02:05.258
You'll know why
in a second.

02:05.291 --> 02:06.827
Jenny did not commit
this crime.

02:06.860 --> 02:09.996
I know this because one of
my biggest corporate clients

02:10.030 --> 02:11.131
was with her at the time.

02:11.164 --> 02:12.833
Playing checkers?

02:12.866 --> 02:15.001
Exactly.

02:15.035 --> 02:16.803
He's not willing
to come forward,

02:16.837 --> 02:18.171
instead, he comes to me.

02:18.204 --> 02:21.642
Hires me to defend her,
evidently he feels bad for her.

02:21.675 --> 02:26.112
Cut to, I'm headed into
trial today.

02:26.146 --> 02:28.048
Lot of money in it.

02:28.081 --> 02:29.349
Take a hand-off?

02:29.382 --> 02:31.284
For a trial
starting today?

02:31.317 --> 02:32.519
You'll get a continuance.

02:32.553 --> 02:33.654
Danny...

02:33.687 --> 02:35.221
I figure it's probably
unethical for me

02:35.255 --> 02:36.489
to represent the girl
and my client anyway.

02:36.523 --> 02:38.291
Oh, just now
you figure that out?

02:38.324 --> 02:39.626
The case is circumstantial.

02:39.660 --> 02:41.728
I thought for sure
it would go away.

02:41.762 --> 02:43.363
And it didn't.

02:43.396 --> 02:47.233
Like I said, I'm in a jam.

02:47.267 --> 02:51.538
Bobby, for old time's sake,
bail me out.

02:51.572 --> 02:55.542
She needs a real
criminal lawyer.

03:08.088 --> 03:10.256
(telephone rings)

03:17.531 --> 03:19.465
(cell door slams, locks)

03:25.205 --> 03:27.874
(sirens wail)

03:46.293 --> 03:47.865
How do you agree
to even represent her?

03:47.865 --> 03:49.806
 Because she'd been stuck
with some rookie P. D.,

03:49.806 --> 03:50.797
and my client wanted her
taken care of.

03:50.831 --> 03:51.965
Taken care of

03:51.998 --> 03:53.567
would be getting her
an independent lawyer

03:53.600 --> 03:55.636
who might track
your client down
as a witness.

03:55.669 --> 03:59.472
Look, she's better off
with me than the P. D.

03:59.506 --> 04:01.808
But you're the best I know.

04:05.445 --> 04:07.447
-Who's sitting?
-Nelson.

04:07.480 --> 04:10.283
Nelson? He's not gonna
give you a continuance.

04:10.316 --> 04:12.953
If the D. A. agrees,
he might.

04:12.986 --> 04:14.320
Who's the D. A.?

04:14.354 --> 04:16.488
Helen Gamble.

04:18.692 --> 04:21.661
I told him to meet me
over here at court.

04:21.695 --> 04:23.096
All right, Lucy, if
he does show up there,

04:23.129 --> 04:24.831
just tell him to get
his ass down here quick

04:24.865 --> 04:28.602
before the judge
issues a warrant, okay?

04:30.003 --> 04:31.672
Earl, hey.

04:31.705 --> 04:33.273
Ellenor.

04:33.306 --> 04:34.808
Uh-oh. You've
got that look.

04:34.841 --> 04:36.176
What look?

04:36.209 --> 04:37.644
The look of a defense attorney
who's missing a client.

04:37.678 --> 04:39.680
Is he a no-show again?

04:42.649 --> 04:44.785
He inserted his
little missile

04:44.818 --> 04:46.920
into every orifice
on her body.

04:46.953 --> 04:49.856
With me, he's
a little flaccid
piece of confetti,

04:49.890 --> 04:52.158
and suddenly
with his secretary,

04:52.192 --> 04:53.426
he becomes Stonehenge.

04:53.459 --> 04:54.828
Could I stop you
one second?

04:54.861 --> 04:56.162
Yes.

04:56.196 --> 04:58.532
The thing about
no-fault divorce,

04:58.565 --> 05:00.133
blame doesn't
become an issue.

05:00.166 --> 05:01.668
I want it to.

05:01.702 --> 05:04.437
Mrs. Keplar,
these things come down
to financial statements.

05:04.470 --> 05:06.306
I want it to come down
to more.

05:06.339 --> 05:10.376
Married 19 years. It has
to come down to more.

05:10.410 --> 05:13.179
And by more you mean...

05:13.213 --> 05:14.848
Pain. His.

05:14.881 --> 05:16.883
He needs to hurt.

05:18.852 --> 05:21.187
Your Honor, we'd be
asking for a warrant.

05:21.221 --> 05:22.322
It's already 10:30,

05:22.355 --> 05:23.489
and the defendant
is not present.

05:23.524 --> 05:24.691
Ms. Frutt, any information

05:24.725 --> 05:26.459
on your client's
whereabouts?

05:26.492 --> 05:28.128
Well, Your Honor, um,

05:28.161 --> 05:29.996
if you could hold this case
for just a few more minutes,

05:30.030 --> 05:33.066
I'm sure Mr. Sowers
is on his way.

05:33.099 --> 05:35.669
He has to take two buses,
and it's possible--

05:35.702 --> 05:37.337
I think that
an hour and a half

05:37.370 --> 05:38.404
is long enough to wait,

05:38.438 --> 05:40.507
even taking the pitfalls

05:40.541 --> 05:42.408
of public transportation
into account.

05:42.442 --> 05:46.146
Last call for Sowers.

05:46.179 --> 05:47.213
Leonard Sowers.

05:47.247 --> 05:48.915
(groans)

05:48.949 --> 05:50.083
Leonard?

05:51.752 --> 05:52.653
I'm here.

05:52.686 --> 05:54.555
Um, he's here,
Your Honor.

05:54.588 --> 05:56.022
He's been here
all along.

05:58.625 --> 06:00.493
Your motion is denied.

06:00.527 --> 06:02.262
Your Honor, I just
got this case.

06:02.295 --> 06:04.731
I don't care. Mr. Rogers has
had it for three months.

06:04.765 --> 06:07.701
Mr. Rogers doesn't
specialize in criminal law.

06:07.734 --> 06:09.903
Well, he should
have thought of that
before now.

06:09.936 --> 06:12.372
Your Honor. Come on.

06:13.473 --> 06:15.241
I'll give you the morning
to get up to speed.

06:15.275 --> 06:17.844
After lunch, we go.

06:17.878 --> 06:19.613
Adjourned.

06:22.816 --> 06:24.017
Great.

06:24.050 --> 06:25.051
Sorry, Bobby.

06:25.085 --> 06:26.620
You should probably
meet with her.

06:30.624 --> 06:33.059
(elevator bell dings)

06:38.064 --> 06:39.199
What's going on,
Leonard?

06:39.232 --> 06:41.267
I'm not feeling
too good.

06:41.301 --> 06:42.769
I need to get
a continuance.

06:42.803 --> 06:44.470
Well, that's not gonna happen.
We talked about this.

06:44.505 --> 06:46.306
This is the third time
your case has been
set for trial.

06:46.339 --> 06:47.974
Ellie.

06:48.008 --> 06:52.278
Oh, God. I'm practically
getting a contact high
off your breath.

06:52.312 --> 06:53.547
I needed to calm
my nerves.

06:53.580 --> 06:55.448
Being a defendant
is stressful.

06:55.481 --> 06:57.551
Well, being you attorney
is stressful.

06:57.584 --> 07:00.954
And you know, I asked you
to tone down what
you wear for trial.

07:00.987 --> 07:02.989
The last thing we need
is for a jury

07:03.023 --> 07:05.458
to think you look like
a drug dealer.

07:05.491 --> 07:06.660
I don't understand.

07:06.693 --> 07:07.961
They got Denny Staples
for this.

07:07.994 --> 07:09.930
Why they gotta keep
coming after me?

07:09.963 --> 07:11.732
Because you were
in the apartment

07:11.765 --> 07:13.066
when the police raided it.

07:13.099 --> 07:15.301
And just because
a co-defendant
pleads guilty,

07:15.335 --> 07:17.137
doesn't mean they dismiss
your case.

07:17.170 --> 07:19.439
How many times do
I have to explain that?

07:19.472 --> 07:21.174
You sound like you're
on their side.

07:21.207 --> 07:22.776
I am on your side.

07:22.809 --> 07:25.946
I have been on your side
for nine years, you big dope.

07:27.714 --> 07:30.817
Leonard, listen to me.

07:30.851 --> 07:33.920
With your priors,
if we lose here,

07:33.954 --> 07:39.259
you are looking
at 20 years.

07:39.292 --> 07:40.661
Do you get that?

07:40.694 --> 07:44.464
Because I really need you
to get that.

07:47.534 --> 07:50.036
Who am I talking to here?

07:52.305 --> 07:54.040
We both heard
the scream.

07:54.074 --> 07:57.010
And when we looked
out the window,
that's when we saw him.

07:57.043 --> 07:58.378
The victim?

07:58.411 --> 08:01.381
And somebody
running away.

08:01.414 --> 08:03.349
The man I was with
just left.

08:03.383 --> 08:05.385
He wanted to get
out of the area before
the police came.

08:05.418 --> 08:07.187
And what did you do?

08:07.220 --> 08:08.454
I went down the street

08:08.488 --> 08:09.990
to check on the guy
who got stabbed.

08:10.023 --> 08:11.525
And that's when
the police came

08:11.558 --> 08:13.226
and arrested me,
saying I did it.

08:13.259 --> 08:15.061
Okay, Jenny. Um...

08:15.095 --> 08:19.032
Mr. Rogers has some
conflicts of interest
here, you know this.

08:19.065 --> 08:20.333
Yes.

08:20.366 --> 08:22.536
-The man I was with
was his client.
-Yeah.

08:22.569 --> 08:24.805
And since Mr. Rogers
has to look out
for his client,

08:24.838 --> 08:27.173
he won't tell you to
reveal this man's name.

08:27.207 --> 08:28.341
He never told me
his name.

08:28.374 --> 08:30.544
Just the same, we have
to try to find him.

08:30.577 --> 08:32.044
Bobby.

08:32.078 --> 08:34.881
I'm sorry, Danny,
I can't not tell her this.

08:34.914 --> 08:36.381
The reason
I came to you--

08:36.416 --> 08:39.720
Jenny, I'm gonna talk
to Mr. Rogers for a second,

08:39.753 --> 08:41.554
and then I'll be back.

08:41.587 --> 08:43.123
(knocking)

08:47.628 --> 08:49.730
I told you what I told
you in confidence.

08:49.763 --> 08:52.566
Are you nuts? Of course
she has to know this.

08:52.599 --> 08:53.734
In a textbook world,
yes, but--

08:53.767 --> 08:55.235
No, Danny, in this world.

08:55.268 --> 08:58.238
She can't be protecting
the identity of her alibi.

08:58.271 --> 08:59.840
She is up on murder.

08:59.873 --> 09:01.241
Look at it
from our side.

09:01.274 --> 09:03.844
My client...he has no
duty to come forward.

09:03.877 --> 09:05.579
No duty to help out
getting her a lawyer.

09:05.612 --> 09:07.247
So why should he be
punished for doing so?

09:07.280 --> 09:09.550
Well, I doubt if he'll
get charged for--

09:09.583 --> 09:10.751
It's not
the criminal charges.

09:10.784 --> 09:12.686
He's a CEO, married,
four kids.

09:12.719 --> 09:14.287
And by the way,
she's under-aged.

09:14.320 --> 09:15.355
He would get charged.

09:15.388 --> 09:16.857
Danny.

09:16.890 --> 09:19.526
The girl can't be counseled
to conceal her alibi.

09:19.560 --> 09:20.761
I know you know this.

09:20.794 --> 09:22.462
She didn't get
his name anyway, so--

09:22.495 --> 09:23.597
You know his name.

09:23.630 --> 09:24.931
Attorney-client
privilege.

09:24.965 --> 09:26.466
I couldn't give it
to you if I wanted to.

09:26.499 --> 09:28.301
So you're willing to ignore
the rules for one client,

09:28.334 --> 09:29.369
but not for the other.

09:29.402 --> 09:30.604
That's not fair.

09:30.637 --> 09:33.473
Look, we can debate
this all day.

09:33.507 --> 09:36.543
Bottom line,
we both want to
help out that girl.

09:36.577 --> 09:38.178
Let's do what we can.

09:41.347 --> 09:42.783
Oh, no, you don't.

09:42.816 --> 09:44.718
You've never done
a divorce case.

09:44.751 --> 09:46.553
This will be
a good experience.

09:46.587 --> 09:49.055
Sounds like a Lujack,
every Lujack is so
I can get experience.

09:49.089 --> 09:51.491
Rebecca, you heard
that woman.

09:51.525 --> 09:54.060
She wants somebody
nasty.

09:54.094 --> 09:57.163
Now, do you think
that helped sway me?

09:57.197 --> 09:59.399
How about we do it
together?

09:59.432 --> 10:00.767
Having you by my side,

10:00.801 --> 10:04.104
maybe it'll make me
nastier.

10:04.137 --> 10:06.039
I didn't mean
how that came out.

10:10.010 --> 10:10.811
Hey.

10:10.844 --> 10:12.178
Hey, Kendall.

10:13.346 --> 10:14.648
Is my dad here?

10:14.681 --> 10:16.817
I think he's down
posting a bond.

10:16.850 --> 10:18.519
He should be back
any second.

10:18.552 --> 10:20.186
Okay.

10:24.958 --> 10:26.760
You burn, you know that?

10:26.793 --> 10:28.829
Excuse me?

10:29.696 --> 10:31.798
Uh...

10:31.832 --> 10:33.166
You like movies?

10:33.199 --> 10:34.300
Good ones.

10:34.334 --> 10:38.004
Maybe want to go to
the movies sometime?

10:38.038 --> 10:39.205
With me?

10:39.239 --> 10:41.675
You mean as friends?

10:41.708 --> 10:44.611
Yeah. Yeah, as friends.

10:44.645 --> 10:47.714
Well, um, sure.

10:48.749 --> 10:50.383
Excellent.

10:53.920 --> 10:57.023
Mrs. Keplar.
This is Rebecca Washington.

10:57.057 --> 10:59.025
She's gonna do
this case with me.

10:59.059 --> 11:00.961
Hi.

11:00.994 --> 11:02.729
Hi.

11:02.763 --> 11:05.098
Good. She looks meaner.

11:06.366 --> 11:08.735
Much.

11:10.270 --> 11:11.738
Then we entered
the residence

11:11.772 --> 11:13.006
pursuant to
a search warrant.

11:13.039 --> 11:14.908
And what did you discover?

11:14.941 --> 11:16.743
Another subject,
Denny Staples,

11:16.777 --> 11:18.411
was seated at
the kitchen table.

11:18.444 --> 11:20.681
On top of the table,
right in front of
that subject,

11:20.714 --> 11:24.384
was a large bag
of a white crystalline
substance

11:24.417 --> 11:26.019
I believed to be
cocaine.

11:26.052 --> 11:28.689
Did you discover anything else
in that kitchen area?

11:28.722 --> 11:30.390
Yes. Also on
the kitchen table

11:30.423 --> 11:31.758
there was a beam scale

11:31.792 --> 11:34.595
and numerous empty
mini zip-lock baggies.

11:34.628 --> 11:36.563
These are items
commonly used

11:36.597 --> 11:38.264
to package
drugs for sale.

11:38.298 --> 11:42.335
Anybody else present in
the apartment at that time?

11:42.368 --> 11:45.071
I found Mr. Sowers,
the defendant,

11:45.105 --> 11:47.407
lying down on a sofa
in the living room.

11:47.440 --> 11:50.276
Did you notice anything
unusual about the defendant?

11:50.310 --> 11:54.948
Yes. Lying on his chest
was a bag of cocaine,

11:54.981 --> 11:57.851
packaged in the same
plastic packaging
material

11:57.884 --> 12:00.420
that was recovered
from the kitchen table.

12:00.453 --> 12:01.788
(snoring)

12:06.326 --> 12:07.861
And what did you do
at the time?

12:07.894 --> 12:09.930
I placed the defendant
under arrest,

12:09.963 --> 12:11.264
and another officer

12:11.297 --> 12:13.099
placed Mr. Staples under
arrest in the kitchen.

12:13.133 --> 12:15.536
We recovered
the seized items,

12:15.569 --> 12:18.104
then they were
inventoried
by Officer Terrell,

12:18.138 --> 12:20.774
the suspect narcotics
were sent to
the crime lab

12:20.807 --> 12:22.308
for testing
and analysis,

12:22.342 --> 12:25.111
which proved positive
for cocaine.

12:37.524 --> 12:40.126
Officer Smitko,
my client wasn't named

12:40.160 --> 12:42.295
in the search warrant
you were executing, was he?

12:42.328 --> 12:43.396
No, he wasn't.

12:43.429 --> 12:44.931
In fact, the only person
named in the warrant

12:44.965 --> 12:46.299
was Denny Staples.

12:46.332 --> 12:47.734
That's right.

12:47.768 --> 12:49.836
And who let you
into the apartment
that morning?

12:49.870 --> 12:51.304
We entered forcibly.

12:51.337 --> 12:53.339
You broke down
the front door.

12:53.373 --> 12:54.508
Correct.

12:54.541 --> 12:55.642
And how many officers

12:55.676 --> 12:56.810
were involved with
that raid?

12:56.843 --> 12:58.444
Eight altogether.

12:58.478 --> 13:00.781
And did you
announce your office
when you entered?

13:00.814 --> 13:02.148
Yes, we did.

13:02.182 --> 13:05.586
So, the noise of the
door being broken down,

13:05.619 --> 13:07.453
eight officers entering,

13:07.487 --> 13:10.657
and you're saying
Leonard was just lying
peacefully on the sofa,

13:10.691 --> 13:12.793
bag of drugs
in full view.

13:12.826 --> 13:14.360
He appeared to be
passed out.

13:14.394 --> 13:15.996
And did he wake up
when you entered?

13:16.029 --> 13:19.099
No. I had to shake him
a little to wake him up.

13:19.132 --> 13:21.167
So, you don't know
if he even knew

13:21.201 --> 13:22.636
the drugs were
on his chest.

13:22.669 --> 13:24.505
How could he not know?

13:24.538 --> 13:26.973
Well, you didn't see
Leonard place the bag
on his chest, did you?

13:27.007 --> 13:28.842
No. It was there
when I entered.

13:28.875 --> 13:30.343
So, isn't it possible

13:30.376 --> 13:32.378
that somebody placed
it on his chest

13:32.412 --> 13:33.547
after he fell asleep?

13:33.580 --> 13:35.015
Anything's possible, but--

13:35.048 --> 13:38.118
You don't know who
put it there, do you?

13:38.151 --> 13:40.787
No.

13:40.821 --> 13:43.056
I have no interest
in hell.

13:43.089 --> 13:45.491
But I'd sooner
go there to rot

13:45.526 --> 13:47.027
before giving her
a penny,

13:47.060 --> 13:51.131
not a dime, not
a nickel, but a penny
more than I have to.

13:51.164 --> 13:53.534
Except if she agreed
to stick it up her ass.

13:53.567 --> 13:56.169
In that case, I'd hold
out a silver dollar.

13:56.202 --> 13:57.370
Am I being too subtle?

13:57.403 --> 13:59.172
You see, this is
what I lived with.

13:59.205 --> 14:01.542
All his anger over being
short, fat, and witless

14:01.575 --> 14:02.576
he directs towards me.

14:02.609 --> 14:04.978
All my misery
I take out on you

14:05.011 --> 14:06.479
because you inspire it.

14:06.513 --> 14:09.082
All right. Let's try
to be constructive here.

14:09.115 --> 14:10.851
I didn't hire you
to be constructive.

14:10.884 --> 14:12.085
I hired you to get even.

14:12.118 --> 14:13.386
Could I interject
just for a second?

14:13.419 --> 14:15.889
We are not talking about
a lot of money here,

14:15.922 --> 14:17.558
and the division
is pretty statutory.

14:17.591 --> 14:19.860
I'm quite happy
to give her what
she's entitled to,

14:19.893 --> 14:22.563
as long as she spends
that much in legal fees
trying to get it.

14:22.596 --> 14:24.598
Mr. Keplar, that remark
could come back to cost you.

14:24.631 --> 14:28.234
Mr. Berluti, I can
understand how someone

14:28.268 --> 14:30.571
could represent
murderers, rapists...

14:30.604 --> 14:32.405
They're human beings, too.

14:32.438 --> 14:35.041
Here's a tip. She isn't.

14:35.075 --> 14:37.043
Deep down,
she's as much the pig

14:37.077 --> 14:38.444
as she looks like
on the surface.

14:38.478 --> 14:42.082
I dream of a meat hook
running up your rectum.

14:42.115 --> 14:45.919
It's the only way
I can sleep peaceful.

14:45.952 --> 14:49.155
I'm not comfortable
with this dialogue.

14:50.056 --> 14:52.559
I know it had
to be around 10:30

14:52.593 --> 14:54.528
because that's when
I left the restaurant,

14:54.561 --> 14:57.297
which is maybe
a mile from there.

14:57.330 --> 14:59.232
Can you tell us
what you saw?

14:59.265 --> 15:02.068
Basically,
two people arguing.

15:02.102 --> 15:04.437
The guy looked
kind of heated

15:04.470 --> 15:07.440
and the woman
was dressed like
a prostitute.

15:07.473 --> 15:10.577
As we turned the corner,
we saw a woman running

15:10.611 --> 15:13.547
in the opposite direction,
away from the body.

15:13.580 --> 15:14.480
What did you do then?

15:14.515 --> 15:16.116
I let my partner out

15:16.149 --> 15:17.317
to tend to the victim.

15:17.350 --> 15:19.586
I then continued
my pursuit of the woman.

15:19.620 --> 15:21.421
She ran down an alley.

15:21.454 --> 15:23.256
I got out and
chased her on foot,

15:23.289 --> 15:25.158
and eventually,
I caught up to her.

15:25.191 --> 15:27.293
I then placed her
under arrest.

15:27.327 --> 15:30.263
Do you see that woman in
this courtroom, officer?

15:30.296 --> 15:33.133
I do. The defendant.

15:33.166 --> 15:36.102
You never saw her do
anything to the victim.

15:36.136 --> 15:37.771
No, I didn't.

15:37.804 --> 15:39.773
You just saw her
run away.

15:39.806 --> 15:40.807
Yes.

15:40.841 --> 15:42.576
And when you
caught up to her,

15:42.609 --> 15:43.844
did she say anything?

15:43.877 --> 15:45.646
She denied stabbing the man.

15:45.679 --> 15:47.581
See any blood
on her clothing?

15:47.614 --> 15:48.915
No.

15:48.949 --> 15:50.316
Find a murder weapon?

15:50.350 --> 15:51.518
No.

15:51.552 --> 15:53.353
Thank you, officer.

15:56.022 --> 15:57.991
You have to testify.

15:58.024 --> 16:01.127
Why were you seen
near the body?

16:01.161 --> 16:02.663
Only you can answer
that question.

16:02.696 --> 16:04.030
Okay.

16:04.064 --> 16:05.331
Now, look,
I'll tell you again,

16:05.365 --> 16:06.867
if we can just find
this guy you were with--

16:06.900 --> 16:09.936
Mr. Donnell, even if I could
find out who this guy is,

16:09.970 --> 16:12.506
I don't really want
to turn him in.

16:12.539 --> 16:15.375
He's helped me
by giving me lawyers,

16:15.408 --> 16:17.978
paying for them.

16:18.011 --> 16:20.213
I'm not about
to betray the guy.

16:20.246 --> 16:22.348
Well, that's admirable,
Jenny.

16:22.382 --> 16:25.018
Are you ready to be
convicted of murder?

16:25.051 --> 16:27.954
Mr. Rogers thinks
we'll win.

16:27.988 --> 16:30.991
It's close enough
to get nervous.

16:31.024 --> 16:33.193
What about calling
Rogers to the stand,

16:33.226 --> 16:35.696
let him testify as
to the whole situation.

16:35.729 --> 16:37.030
What do you mean?

16:37.063 --> 16:39.332
Rogers can testify his
client was with the girl

16:39.365 --> 16:40.567
at the time
of the murders,

16:40.601 --> 16:42.468
but attorney-client
privilege

16:42.503 --> 16:44.805
prevents him from saying
who his client is.

16:44.838 --> 16:45.972
It would be hearsay.

16:46.006 --> 16:47.373
Declaration against
interests.

16:47.407 --> 16:51.244
The guy was with
an underage hooker.

16:51.277 --> 16:53.714
My advice is
go to the judge now,

16:53.747 --> 16:56.149
this is way too dicey,
Bobby, even for you.

16:56.182 --> 16:59.352
Anonymous hearsay?

16:59.385 --> 17:00.987
JIMMY: Is it ethical
to try that?

17:01.021 --> 17:02.923
Well, I don't know.
But it seems...

17:02.956 --> 17:04.891
Neither of them
is looking for
anything material,

17:04.925 --> 17:07.093
they just want to be
satisfied the other
is miserable.

17:07.127 --> 17:09.162
I'm not very good
at play acting.

17:09.194 --> 17:11.865
I couldn't convince
my mother to let me
stay home from school

17:11.897 --> 17:13.233
even when I had a fever.

17:13.266 --> 17:17.137
We could start with
Delores. Then do James.

17:18.638 --> 17:21.406
But it means kind of lying
to our clients.

17:21.441 --> 17:25.011
Mr. Berluti, we're kind
of lying to them anyway,

17:25.045 --> 17:26.747
pretending to be
sympathetic.

17:26.780 --> 17:28.448
They're awful people.

17:30.383 --> 17:32.919
Well, it's just an idea.
If you think...

17:32.953 --> 17:35.455
No. Let's do it.

17:35.488 --> 17:37.423
What do you mean
he asked you out?

17:37.457 --> 17:39.125
He asked me to go
to the movies with him.

17:39.159 --> 17:41.094
What did you say?

17:41.127 --> 17:45.265
Well, um,
I meant to say no.

17:45.298 --> 17:46.600
You meant to say no?

17:46.633 --> 17:52.472
I did. Yeah. But it just
came out sort of...yes.

17:52.506 --> 17:55.041
What?

17:55.075 --> 17:56.777
He said let's go
as friends.

17:56.810 --> 17:57.944
And, he's
a nice kid and--

17:57.978 --> 18:01.582
You gotta
tell him no, Lucy.

18:02.816 --> 18:04.718
I--I will.

18:04.751 --> 18:06.587
But you better be
there to talk to him
afterwards

18:06.620 --> 18:09.255
'cause if he's got
this big crush,

18:09.289 --> 18:11.592
he's gonna be hurt.

18:13.827 --> 18:15.495
He's 11.

18:24.605 --> 18:26.272
Me testify?

18:26.306 --> 18:28.341
Just tell it like it is.

18:28.374 --> 18:29.810
You think Nelson
would go for it?

18:29.843 --> 18:34.681
I don't know. He'd ask
for some offer of proof.

18:34.715 --> 18:35.816
Are you willing to do it?

18:35.849 --> 18:39.753
Well...

18:39.786 --> 18:41.988
I'd have to convince
my client,

18:42.022 --> 18:43.524
but I think he'd
go along.

18:43.557 --> 18:45.992
Suppose Gamble
then subpoena's
my client list

18:46.026 --> 18:48.161
and starts
an investigation?

18:48.194 --> 18:49.362
Identity isn't
privileged.

18:49.395 --> 18:51.131
I think we could make
an argument

18:51.164 --> 18:52.766
that in this case,
it should be.

18:52.799 --> 18:55.368
It's risky.

18:57.538 --> 18:59.840
Let's first see how Jenny
does on the stand, all right?

18:59.873 --> 19:02.876
And then...then we can
make a decision.

19:07.881 --> 19:09.683
20 years?

19:11.051 --> 19:12.018
Yes.

19:12.052 --> 19:13.854
And I'd have to serve it?

19:15.221 --> 19:17.323
Leonard, haven't you
been listening to me?

19:18.725 --> 19:20.961
Okay. Look,

19:20.994 --> 19:22.796
tomorrow Staples
is gonna testify,

19:22.829 --> 19:24.030
if he does okay...

19:24.064 --> 19:28.001
Hey, hey, hey. Hey, we haven't
lost yet. Come on.

19:28.034 --> 19:30.504
I'm sorry.

19:30.537 --> 19:32.806
All right,
all right, come on.

19:32.839 --> 19:34.575
This is what we need.

19:34.608 --> 19:36.510
You have to go home
and sleep.

19:36.543 --> 19:37.911
You have to get
some rest.

19:37.944 --> 19:39.212
We don't want you
falling asleep
in court anymore.

19:39.245 --> 19:40.380
Okay.

19:40.413 --> 19:42.849
Clean and sober
tomorrow, okay?

19:44.184 --> 19:46.219
Can you do that,
Leonard?

19:49.890 --> 19:52.225
Yeah.

19:54.194 --> 19:55.796
Okay.

20:09.743 --> 20:11.578
Denny, I thought you
were going to shave.

20:11.612 --> 20:14.515
I'm a convicted
drug dealer, Ms. Frutt.

20:14.548 --> 20:16.016
You really think people
are gonna think less of me

20:16.049 --> 20:17.918
'cause I got a beard?

20:17.951 --> 20:19.252
Well, they might think less
of you if you look like
Charles Manson.

20:19.285 --> 20:21.187
Look, I owned up
to the truth

20:21.221 --> 20:22.422
and pled guilty to this.

20:22.455 --> 20:23.724
How can they be
going after Leonard?

20:23.757 --> 20:26.727
Because they are and
you sticking up for him,

20:26.760 --> 20:29.429
the way you look,
this could hurt us.

20:29.462 --> 20:31.364
Denny, you promised
that you would shave

20:31.397 --> 20:33.333
before they brought
you over.

20:34.735 --> 20:37.938
What size jacket
do you wear?

20:37.971 --> 20:39.973
42 regular.

20:41.241 --> 20:43.409
(sighs)
Pick up, Lucy.

20:43.443 --> 20:47.447
For once in your life,
do something useful
and pick up.

20:47.480 --> 20:50.450
We heard
this awful scream.

20:50.483 --> 20:51.952
By "we," you mean...

20:51.985 --> 20:53.153
The man I was with.

20:53.186 --> 20:55.455
-Client.
-Yes.

20:55.488 --> 20:57.457
Do you know who this man is?

20:57.490 --> 20:59.726
No. He was just some
businessman.

20:59.760 --> 21:03.730
And as soon as we
looked out and saw...

21:03.764 --> 21:06.132
Well, this man was
lying in the street,

21:06.166 --> 21:07.300
and somebody was
running off,

21:07.333 --> 21:08.802
it was obviously
a crime.

21:08.835 --> 21:10.336
And my trick...

21:10.370 --> 21:12.438
this man, he just wanted
to get out of the area

21:12.472 --> 21:14.608
before the police came,
and so he took off.

21:14.641 --> 21:16.677
And what did you do,
Jenny?

21:16.710 --> 21:19.445
I went down the street
to help the man.

21:19.479 --> 21:22.348
He was bleeding.

21:22.382 --> 21:24.184
I was about to put
my hand on the wound

21:24.217 --> 21:25.485
to try and stop
the bleeding,

21:25.519 --> 21:27.187
but then I heard
the police cars coming

21:27.220 --> 21:28.321
and I suddenly
thought...

21:28.354 --> 21:30.290
This can't look
good for me.

21:30.323 --> 21:32.425
They can help him.
So then I took off.

21:32.458 --> 21:33.827
But you were caught.

21:33.860 --> 21:35.461
Yeah.

21:35.495 --> 21:38.198
But I didn't stab him.

21:39.199 --> 21:42.102
You can't threaten custody.
He already has weekends--

21:42.135 --> 21:44.137
Everything's subject to
changed circumstances.

21:44.170 --> 21:45.338
We can re-file any time.

21:45.371 --> 21:46.840
What's changed?

21:46.873 --> 21:47.941
My mood.

21:47.974 --> 21:49.475
And the presumption goes
to the mother. So if--

21:49.510 --> 21:50.844
Wait a second.

21:50.877 --> 21:53.479
Are you using the kids
as--as leverage?

21:53.514 --> 21:54.781
I'll use whatever
I have to.

21:54.815 --> 21:56.349
You know why,
Mrs. Pierce?

21:56.382 --> 21:58.184
This isn't about
fairness here.

21:58.218 --> 21:59.520
It's not about justice.

21:59.553 --> 22:01.855
It's about money.
And hurt.

22:01.888 --> 22:04.958
Your client's gonna
give till he hurts.

22:04.991 --> 22:07.127
Or I'll walk into court
and call him unfit.

22:07.160 --> 22:10.363
He'll not only be short
and fat and stupid,

22:10.396 --> 22:11.698
he'll be an unfit dad.

22:11.732 --> 22:13.967
You ask him how ugly
he wants this to be,

22:14.000 --> 22:16.136
'cause with me,
there's no limits.

22:16.169 --> 22:20.040
If I screw up
a few innocent kids
along the way, tough.

22:20.073 --> 22:21.341
With him as their dad,

22:21.374 --> 22:22.909
they're probably
screwed up already.

22:29.683 --> 22:32.385
Sorry. I had to get tough.

22:32.418 --> 22:34.755
That's okay.

22:34.788 --> 22:36.256
I brought my trimmers, too.

22:36.289 --> 22:37.658
I want to neaten his hair.

22:37.691 --> 22:39.059
Are these 42 regular?

22:39.092 --> 22:40.761
Uh, I brought one "long"--
they run different.

22:40.794 --> 22:43.329
I want to pancake
these shadows under your eyes.

22:43.363 --> 22:45.065
It'll come right off.

22:45.098 --> 22:47.534
I appreciate
what you guys
are doing for Lenny.

22:47.568 --> 22:49.402
Yeah, well,
after all you did for him.

22:49.435 --> 22:50.671
I'm here now,
aren't I?

22:50.704 --> 22:52.172
Yes, yes, you are.

22:52.205 --> 22:53.907
You're gonna be handsome
when I'm done with you.

22:53.940 --> 22:56.543
Well, I'll be out
in seven, cupcake.

22:56.577 --> 22:59.780
Like, seriously,
no, thank you.

23:02.382 --> 23:04.250
This client
was a businessman?

23:04.284 --> 23:05.786
Yes.

23:05.819 --> 23:07.921
Upon searching you and
your apartment that night,

23:07.954 --> 23:11.224
the police found
only $42 in cash.

23:11.257 --> 23:13.193
Do you work for $42?

23:13.226 --> 23:14.728
He hadn't paid me yet.

23:14.761 --> 23:16.563
Your clients
don't pay you in advance?

23:16.597 --> 23:18.264
He was about to pay me.

23:18.298 --> 23:19.900
This businessman?

23:19.933 --> 23:21.434
Yes.

23:21.467 --> 23:24.838
Could you describe
what he looks like,
this businessman?

23:27.473 --> 23:29.776
He was kind of tall,
brown hair.

23:29.810 --> 23:30.811
How old?

23:30.844 --> 23:33.614
I think around 40
or something.

23:33.647 --> 23:35.215
What color eyes?

23:35.248 --> 23:37.751
Um, I think blue.

23:37.784 --> 23:40.453
When the police
questioned you
that first night,

23:40.486 --> 23:42.823
why didn't you tell them
about this businessman?

23:42.856 --> 23:45.759
Well, I didn't want
to be arrested
for prostitution.

23:45.792 --> 23:48.629
-So you lied
to avoid arrest?
-Yeah.

23:48.662 --> 23:49.896
You lie when you have to?

23:49.930 --> 23:51.164
Objection.

23:51.197 --> 23:52.766
Sustained.

23:52.799 --> 23:56.169
You say this businessman
was fortyish with brown eyes?

23:56.202 --> 23:57.571
Yes.

23:57.604 --> 23:59.673
See, actually you said
his hair was brown.

23:59.706 --> 24:01.775
His eyes were blue.
What color were they?

24:01.808 --> 24:03.476
-I'll give you two out of three.
-Objection!

24:03.510 --> 24:04.578
Overruled.

24:04.611 --> 24:06.913
What color were his eyes?

24:06.947 --> 24:08.148
Blue.

24:08.181 --> 24:10.150
And you never heard
from this businessman again?

24:11.785 --> 24:12.819
No.

24:12.853 --> 24:14.688
When the police
first apprehended you,

24:14.721 --> 24:16.456
you said
you didn't stab him.

24:16.489 --> 24:18.491
-Yes.
-How do you know
he was stabbed?

24:18.525 --> 24:20.761
Well, he looked like
he was stabbed!

24:20.794 --> 24:22.796
-You didn't see him
get stabbed?
-No!

24:22.829 --> 24:24.164
You didn't see a knife
when you got to the body?

24:24.197 --> 24:25.331
No!

24:25.365 --> 24:26.633
So in the heat
of the moment,

24:26.667 --> 24:27.467
you just happened
to guess correctly.

24:27.500 --> 24:28.468
Objection!

24:28.502 --> 24:30.170
Withdrawn. That's all.

24:30.203 --> 24:31.905
(sniffles)

24:41.515 --> 24:43.517
That didn't go well.

24:43.550 --> 24:45.519
You seem to be
hiding something.

24:46.352 --> 24:48.488
You were a little
hesitant, Jenny.

24:48.522 --> 24:49.723
I was scared.

24:49.756 --> 24:50.991
Look, you know
I'm telling the truth.

24:51.024 --> 24:52.192
Well, I don't think
the jury does.

24:52.225 --> 24:53.527
Danny...

24:53.560 --> 24:55.161
I want
to put you up there.

24:55.195 --> 24:56.730
We have to now!

24:56.763 --> 24:58.031
You think the judge
will allow it?

24:58.064 --> 24:59.700
If he doesn't,
we move for a mistrial.

24:59.733 --> 25:00.967
You got to get on the stand

25:01.001 --> 25:02.969
and tell them
about this client.

25:03.003 --> 25:05.071
They'll fight it
with hearsay,

25:05.105 --> 25:07.173
but we have to try.
Without your testimony,

25:07.207 --> 25:08.842
I don't like the chances.

25:11.444 --> 25:14.247
I think I'll lose
a meal ticket...

25:15.215 --> 25:17.083
but okay.

25:20.721 --> 25:22.689
What's up?

25:22.723 --> 25:27.427
Well, uh, I was just,
you know, wondering...

25:27.460 --> 25:29.329
about this movie
we're supposed to go to.

25:29.362 --> 25:35.068
Even though we say,
"as friends," you...

25:36.269 --> 25:41.675
Well, um, what exactly
are you thinking?

25:41.708 --> 25:43.076
I don't know.

25:43.109 --> 25:45.011
Go to a movie.
Talk and stuff.

25:45.045 --> 25:47.948
Not like boyfriend and
girlfriend stuff, right?

25:51.618 --> 25:53.887
Is that what you
were thinking, Kendall?

25:55.155 --> 25:57.257
No.

25:58.324 --> 26:00.026
Hey, Kendall,

26:00.060 --> 26:04.297
I think you're
a really great kid.

26:04.330 --> 26:05.532
I really do.

26:05.566 --> 26:08.569
I--I got to go.
All right?

26:17.611 --> 26:18.945
I heard.

26:18.979 --> 26:21.982
Now you got to talk
to him, Eugene.

26:24.818 --> 26:27.287
The drugs were mine,
not Leonard's.

26:27.320 --> 26:30.490
Did Leonard have any part
in the packaging or sale
of the drugs?

26:30.524 --> 26:31.792
No.

26:31.825 --> 26:33.493
Well, he uses
from time to time,

26:33.527 --> 26:35.128
but he doesn't deal.

26:35.161 --> 26:37.130
The single bag the police
say they found on his chest,

26:37.163 --> 26:38.999
had he bought that
from you?

26:39.032 --> 26:40.634
No, no, no, no, he was
asleep the entire time

26:40.667 --> 26:42.435
I was doing my business
in the kitchen.

26:42.468 --> 26:44.237
And when he passed out,

26:44.270 --> 26:46.272
there were no drugs
on his chest.

26:46.306 --> 26:47.641
Doing business?

26:47.674 --> 26:50.143
A few people stopped by.

26:50.176 --> 26:52.813
And where were these people
when the police arrived?

26:52.846 --> 26:55.782
They left
about 10 minutes before

26:55.816 --> 26:57.417
the cops
came bustin' in.

26:57.450 --> 26:59.352
Well, is it possible that
Leonard could have had

26:59.385 --> 27:00.954
the bag of drugs
on him the whole time,

27:00.987 --> 27:02.255
and you just didn't
know about it?

27:02.288 --> 27:04.658
No, no, I saw him
when he passed out,

27:04.691 --> 27:05.992
and it wasn't there.

27:06.026 --> 27:08.494
If one of the other guys
that came by earlier

27:08.529 --> 27:09.796
wanted to
drop it on him,

27:09.830 --> 27:11.264
think he's doing him
a favor, maybe.

27:11.297 --> 27:12.966
I don't know.

27:12.999 --> 27:14.500
But if you weren't
in the living room

27:14.535 --> 27:16.503
at the time the other people
walked through,

27:16.537 --> 27:18.138
it's entirely possible

27:18.171 --> 27:20.674
that Mr. Sowers
woke up long enough

27:20.707 --> 27:22.308
to ask somebody
for the drugs.

27:22.342 --> 27:24.344
I would have heard that.

27:24.377 --> 27:26.346
The living room is
right off the kitchen.

27:26.379 --> 27:28.549
And these other people
who stopped by,

27:28.582 --> 27:30.383
they were your customers?

27:30.416 --> 27:31.652
Yes.

27:31.685 --> 27:33.019
And you're testifying
to all this

27:33.053 --> 27:34.655
out of the goodness
of your heart.

27:34.688 --> 27:36.857
I'm up here doin' this
'cause Leonard
is innocent.

27:36.890 --> 27:38.725
He doesn't sell drugs.

27:38.759 --> 27:41.227
(beeper beeps)

27:48.201 --> 27:50.771
(beeper stops)

27:56.612 --> 27:58.802
This is yet another
Bobby Donnell stunt.

27:58.802 --> 27:59.902
It's not a stunt.

27:59.902 --> 28:01.147
You want to call him
as a witness?

28:01.181 --> 28:03.383
Yes, if she needs
time to prepare--

28:03.416 --> 28:04.985
He represents her!

28:05.018 --> 28:06.920
-I know it's out there,
Helen, but--
-Out there?!

28:06.953 --> 28:08.555
Look, the truth is being
sealed up inside

28:08.589 --> 28:10.090
attorney-client
privilege.

28:10.123 --> 28:11.692
Which never
should have happened.

28:11.725 --> 28:13.727
Mr. Rogers, for you
to take this case

28:13.760 --> 28:15.228
is gross malpractice.

28:15.261 --> 28:16.897
It's grounds
for disbarment.

28:16.930 --> 28:18.398
Everything that was done here

28:18.431 --> 28:20.000
was done to help this girl
get a better defense.

28:20.033 --> 28:21.434
-I don't care.
-Look, at this point--

28:21.467 --> 28:23.036
And you're no better!

28:23.069 --> 28:24.538
You should have
reported this.

28:24.571 --> 28:26.239
I learned what I learned
through privilege.
How could--

28:26.272 --> 28:28.441
Then you should've
declined to step in.

28:37.250 --> 28:39.119
Whatever mistakes
have been made,

28:39.152 --> 28:42.122
we can't let them
prejudice the defendant.

28:46.560 --> 28:49.129
He should be able
to testify.

28:51.632 --> 28:54.134
Both of you look at me.

28:54.167 --> 28:56.770
I like things
clean and orderly.

28:56.803 --> 28:58.705
I don't like mess.

28:58.739 --> 29:00.941
I hate mess.

29:00.974 --> 29:03.109
You've made
a big mess here.

29:03.143 --> 29:04.778
After this trial
is over,

29:04.811 --> 29:06.312
you might
find yourselves

29:06.346 --> 29:08.782
in one of your very own.

29:12.786 --> 29:14.821
The drugs were found...

29:14.855 --> 29:16.456
right on him.

29:16.489 --> 29:18.959
But he didn't know
they were there, did he?

29:18.992 --> 29:20.794
He was asleep.

29:20.827 --> 29:22.663
And somebody else...

29:22.696 --> 29:24.998
just dropped that cocaine
on his chest.

29:25.031 --> 29:30.103
And, hey, we had
his friend's word, too.

29:31.171 --> 29:33.239
Another drug dealer
serving time.

29:33.273 --> 29:35.609
One pusher vouching
for the other.

29:35.642 --> 29:37.210
I love loyalty.

29:39.045 --> 29:41.948
Who are we kidding?

29:44.685 --> 29:45.986
For the record,

29:46.019 --> 29:48.321
nothing the state
has put into evidence

29:48.354 --> 29:51.592
shows that Leonard Sowers
knowingly possessed drugs.

29:51.625 --> 29:53.994
He was a guest in the home
of Denny Staples,

29:54.027 --> 29:55.829
who told you
those drugs were his,

29:55.862 --> 29:57.163
and in fact,

29:57.197 --> 30:00.100
pled guilty
for possessing them.

30:00.133 --> 30:02.669
As for the bag that
was lying on his chest,

30:02.703 --> 30:05.471
he testified that
he did not know
how it got there.

30:05.506 --> 30:08.809
And the state never proved
how it got there.

30:08.842 --> 30:14.147
But, hey,
why believe this guy?

30:14.180 --> 30:16.316
I suppose it's easy not to.

30:16.349 --> 30:19.019
When his pager
went off during trial,

30:19.052 --> 30:21.788
didn't we all think,
drug dealer?

30:21.822 --> 30:24.691
And we see how he looks.

30:24.725 --> 30:26.059
Half in the bag.

30:26.092 --> 30:28.494
If he's on drugs,
he'd probably sell them.

30:28.529 --> 30:30.531
And even if he doesn't,
so what?

30:30.564 --> 30:31.898
He's a druggie.

30:31.932 --> 30:33.734
What's the big deal
locking him up?

30:33.767 --> 30:37.037
And you know what?
As his lawyer

30:37.070 --> 30:39.540
and as someone
who cares about him,

30:39.573 --> 30:42.709
and I do...

30:42.743 --> 30:44.010
I've been thinking

30:44.044 --> 30:45.879
maybe prison's
the best thing for him.

30:45.912 --> 30:49.215
It'll help him go straight.

30:49.249 --> 30:53.053
'Cause at
the rate he's headed,

30:53.086 --> 30:55.088
he's gonna end up dead.

30:56.256 --> 30:59.392
He might be better off
in jail.

30:59.425 --> 31:01.862
Only problem...

31:01.895 --> 31:04.164
that's not how this works.

31:04.197 --> 31:08.401
He should only be found
guilty if he did the crime,

31:08.434 --> 31:12.539
and he didn't, and they
can't prove he did.

31:12.573 --> 31:17.243
As a matter of law,
the state did not
make their burden,

31:17.277 --> 31:20.446
and that is
all there is to it.

31:25.919 --> 31:29.455
Actually, that's not all
there is to it.

31:30.991 --> 31:33.894
The reason I do this job...

31:33.927 --> 31:37.598
there are people out there
who don't catch many breaks.

31:37.631 --> 31:42.035
And the business of law
is pretty much like
any other.

31:42.068 --> 31:44.270
You're gonna get
what you pay for.

31:44.304 --> 31:50.977
And, well, a drug addict,
he's not going to get
all that much.

31:51.945 --> 31:54.114
And that's too bad.

31:54.147 --> 31:56.983
Especially when underneath
the glassy eyes

31:57.017 --> 32:00.220
and the disheveled
appearance,

32:00.253 --> 32:01.822
there's a good man.

32:01.855 --> 32:07.493
Especially when underneath
all that visible wreckage,

32:07.528 --> 32:09.830
there's an innocent man.

32:09.863 --> 32:15.168
I don't have any illusions
about getting you to care
about Leonard.

32:16.637 --> 32:19.305
I only ask that when you
go back into that room,

32:19.339 --> 32:22.776
please do not be distracted
from your job

32:22.809 --> 32:25.245
by the fact...

32:25.278 --> 32:28.181
that you don't care.

32:32.519 --> 32:33.987
It's not fair.

32:34.020 --> 32:35.321
She deserves
a lot more than--

32:35.355 --> 32:37.457
It's not gonna happen,
and you know why.

32:37.490 --> 32:40.360
Unfitness
runs both ways.

32:40.393 --> 32:41.662
You don't think
we'll go after her?

32:41.695 --> 32:43.463
-Think again, tubby.
-Hey, you listen--

32:43.496 --> 32:46.032
No, you! The best
interests of the kids

32:46.066 --> 32:47.267
is for this fight
to be over.

32:47.300 --> 32:48.635
Your client knows that.

32:48.669 --> 32:50.270
That's why she'll take
this settlement,

32:50.303 --> 32:51.972
even if it means
getting less money.

32:52.005 --> 32:53.306
You think you're gonna
just steamroll--

32:53.339 --> 32:54.641
There's the deal,
Mr. Berluti.

32:54.675 --> 32:56.510
Call me when you sign off!

32:56.543 --> 32:58.211
Come on, James.

33:03.049 --> 33:05.018
Gee, she seemed
so peaceful.

33:05.051 --> 33:06.687
Yeah, well--

33:06.720 --> 33:08.689
Wait an hour, then call.

33:08.722 --> 33:10.657
Got it.

33:11.758 --> 33:13.026
Well, what was that?

33:13.059 --> 33:14.060
Well, uh...

33:14.094 --> 33:16.162
We kind of faked
these meetings.

33:16.196 --> 33:18.031
Excuse me?

33:18.064 --> 33:20.967
Both clients wanted
satisfaction that they
were getting beaten up.

33:21.001 --> 33:22.569
So we gave it to them...

33:22.603 --> 33:25.572
for a cheaper price than if
they got it for real.

33:25.606 --> 33:26.740
Wait--wait a second.

33:26.773 --> 33:28.675
You and this lawyer--

33:28.709 --> 33:29.710
Play acting.

33:29.743 --> 33:31.177
Well, you can't do that.

33:31.211 --> 33:32.546
Bec, the property settlement
was statutory.

33:32.579 --> 33:34.414
The amount
was gonna be fixed.

33:34.447 --> 33:37.350
They were both looking
for psychological victories.

33:37.383 --> 33:38.719
They both got them.

33:38.752 --> 33:40.521
Jimmy, you're a lawyer,
not a psychologist.

33:40.554 --> 33:42.222
Well, sometimes
we got to be both.

33:42.255 --> 33:44.024
You'll learn this.

33:44.057 --> 33:45.358
Winnin' is good.

33:45.391 --> 33:49.029
Making the client
think he won...better.

33:49.062 --> 33:52.098
He hired me to defend her,
I guess out of conscience.

33:52.132 --> 33:53.600
Who is this man?

33:53.634 --> 33:54.601
That I can't tell you.

33:54.635 --> 33:55.602
Can you explain why?

33:55.636 --> 33:56.703
He told me

33:56.737 --> 33:59.239
in an attorney-client
relationship.

33:59.272 --> 34:01.908
That precludes me from
divulging his identity.

34:01.942 --> 34:04.678
Well, this is probably hard
for the jury to grasp,

34:04.711 --> 34:08.047
and I'd like to ask some
questions that perhaps
they might have.

34:08.081 --> 34:11.217
You went forward
to help this young woman

34:11.251 --> 34:12.753
because you believed
you could offer

34:12.786 --> 34:15.255
a better defense
than the public defender.

34:15.288 --> 34:16.757
-Yes.
-And yet,
you would agree

34:16.790 --> 34:19.059
the best possible defense
that Jenny could get...

34:19.092 --> 34:22.128
would be for your other client
to come forward and back up
her alibi.

34:22.161 --> 34:23.429
Right?

34:23.463 --> 34:25.098
Yes, but that wasn't
going to happen.

34:25.130 --> 34:29.034
Well, suppose
the public defender
hired investigators

34:29.069 --> 34:31.071
and somehow tracked down
his identity.

34:31.103 --> 34:34.574
He could have subpoenaed him
and made it happen, right?

34:34.608 --> 34:38.745
Yes, but I guess
I didn't consider
that too likely.

34:38.779 --> 34:40.813
Public defenders
are overworked as it is.

34:40.847 --> 34:42.415
Excuse me, but
the public defenders I know

34:42.447 --> 34:43.617
are not only pretty good,

34:43.650 --> 34:45.485
but they tend
to try their best,

34:45.518 --> 34:47.621
especially for murder trials.

34:47.654 --> 34:54.060
Mr. Rogers, did you take
this case because your client
feared being tracked down?

34:54.094 --> 34:55.295
I beg your pardon?

34:55.328 --> 34:57.497
Well, it makes sense,
doesn't it?

34:57.531 --> 35:00.300
Who better than
the girl's lawyer
could guarantee

35:00.333 --> 35:01.835
that this man
doesn't get found out?

35:01.868 --> 35:03.303
That's not
what happened.

35:03.336 --> 35:04.738
And I'll assume
you're asking

35:04.771 --> 35:06.306
what you think could be
a juror's question,

35:06.339 --> 35:08.108
'cause I know you know
that didn't happen.

35:08.141 --> 35:09.976
I do know...

35:10.010 --> 35:11.411
because I also
have the benefit

35:11.444 --> 35:13.346
of knowing you personally.

35:13.379 --> 35:15.315
If there's
a more honorable lawyer,

35:15.348 --> 35:16.850
I haven't met him.

35:16.883 --> 35:19.085
Objection, assuming facts
very much not in evidence.

35:19.119 --> 35:20.486
Sustained.

35:20.521 --> 35:23.456
My problem, Danny,
knowing you as well as I do,

35:23.489 --> 35:26.292
I can't believe that you
wouldn't fork over
this guy's name,

35:26.326 --> 35:28.762
even if it means
losing a meal ticket.

35:28.795 --> 35:30.496
I couldn't.
Attorney-client
privilege.

35:30.531 --> 35:33.266
Yes, but balanced
against this woman

35:33.299 --> 35:35.969
being wrongly convicted
of murder?

35:36.002 --> 35:40.841
The Daniel Rogers I know
would reveal the name
of the alibi witness.

35:40.874 --> 35:44.010
Well, I guess you don't
know me as well
as you thought.

35:44.044 --> 35:45.746
Or I don't know
the true stakes.

35:49.215 --> 35:50.817
It was you...

35:50.851 --> 35:53.153
with Jenny Raines
that night, wasn't it?

35:53.186 --> 35:54.888
What?!

35:54.921 --> 35:56.389
I'm sorry
to sandbag you here,
but I couldn't let this go.

35:56.422 --> 35:57.791
What are you talking about?
I wasn't--

35:57.824 --> 35:59.325
Danny, wait for
my next question, okay?

35:59.359 --> 36:00.894
Don't say anything yet.

36:00.927 --> 36:03.664
I apologize
for doing this to you
on the stand,

36:03.697 --> 36:06.867
but I needed the threat
of perjury.

36:06.900 --> 36:09.402
Plus, I know how you value
that oath to tell the truth.

36:09.435 --> 36:12.706
I know your
conscience, Danny.

36:12.739 --> 36:14.675
It's that conscience
that made you come forward

36:14.708 --> 36:16.910
to help Jenny
in the first place.

36:16.943 --> 36:20.246
I'll ask one more time.

36:21.414 --> 36:25.786
A lie will hurt her
and you.

36:28.254 --> 36:30.256
You were the man
she was with.

36:30.290 --> 36:32.559
You both heard the scream.

36:32.593 --> 36:35.361
You both looked
out the window.

36:35.395 --> 36:38.431
That's the truth,
isn't it?

36:41.535 --> 36:44.605
Please answer
the question, Mr. Rogers.

36:49.309 --> 36:53.179
I'm going to assert my
fifth amendment right

36:53.213 --> 36:54.915
and refuse to answer...

36:56.817 --> 37:00.654
On the grounds
that I might
incriminate myself.

37:14.300 --> 37:15.602
The charges
are completely dropped? Yeah.

37:15.636 --> 37:18.271
Sometimes even
the DAs can do
the right thing.

37:18.304 --> 37:20.106
I heard that.

37:20.140 --> 37:21.474
There are conditions.

37:21.508 --> 37:24.611
Foster care program.
Counseling.

37:24.645 --> 37:27.247
All stuff I think is good.

37:28.682 --> 37:30.651
Can, uh...
you give us a sec?

37:30.684 --> 37:31.918
Yeah.

37:31.952 --> 37:33.654
Thanks.

37:34.921 --> 37:35.956
How did you know?

37:35.989 --> 37:38.625
I just suddenly figured.

37:38.659 --> 37:41.127
Does he know I really didn't
tell you anything?

37:41.161 --> 37:43.897
He does now.

37:43.930 --> 37:45.465
Jenny...

37:45.498 --> 37:48.334
how could you sit on
the truth and risk jail?

37:48.368 --> 37:51.905
He came forward
to help me, Mr. Donnell.

37:51.938 --> 37:55.141
And he said
if I got convicted,

37:55.175 --> 37:56.577
he'd tell.

37:56.610 --> 37:58.812
And I believed him.

37:58.845 --> 38:00.480
You know, you're
a little too trusting

38:00.514 --> 38:02.816
for a person
in your line of work.

38:02.849 --> 38:05.686
You ever think about
changing careers?

38:12.358 --> 38:14.728
Will the defendant
please rise?

38:17.731 --> 38:20.500
Madam foreperson,
the jury has reached
a verdict?

38:20.534 --> 38:21.968
We have, Your Honor.

38:22.002 --> 38:23.336
What say you?

38:23.369 --> 38:25.606
Commonwealth versus
Leonard Sowers,

38:25.639 --> 38:28.374
on the count of possession
of a controlled substance

38:28.408 --> 38:29.810
with intent to deliver,

38:29.843 --> 38:32.779
we find the defendant,
Leonard Sowers,

38:32.813 --> 38:34.280
not guilty.

38:34.314 --> 38:35.816
Yes!

38:35.849 --> 38:37.851
On the count of possession
of a controlled substance,

38:37.884 --> 38:40.954
we find the defendant,
Leonard Sowers,

38:40.987 --> 38:42.122
not guilty.

38:42.155 --> 38:45.458
The jury's dismissed with
the thanks of the court.

38:45.491 --> 38:48.529
-You did it.
-We're adjourned.

38:51.565 --> 38:54.067
It means nothing, Leonard,
if you don't get help.

38:54.100 --> 38:55.468
I know! I know--

38:55.501 --> 38:58.338
You keep saying it,
but you need to do it.

38:58.371 --> 39:00.040
Will you let me
help you do it?

39:00.073 --> 39:01.908
Why?

39:01.942 --> 39:02.876
Because if you don't--

39:02.909 --> 39:04.878
No, I mean,
why do you care so much?

39:04.911 --> 39:06.747
I'm just...

39:08.414 --> 39:09.883
Why?

39:12.919 --> 39:15.188
I like you, Leonard.

39:15.221 --> 39:17.924
It's not every day you get
to meet good people.

39:19.092 --> 39:21.528
Yes, I know.

39:45.218 --> 39:47.353
I'm sorry.

39:47.387 --> 39:49.122
You did
what you had to do.

39:49.155 --> 39:52.526
And I know that eventually
you would, too.

39:52.559 --> 39:54.895
That's why
I took the chance.

39:56.897 --> 39:59.099
I didn't come back
to represent her

39:59.132 --> 40:01.267
just to protect me.

40:01.301 --> 40:03.570
I really thought
I could help her.

40:05.138 --> 40:07.140
I know.

40:09.576 --> 40:12.679
I guess I better
go talk to my wife.

40:15.315 --> 40:17.483
I am sorry.

40:18.484 --> 40:19.986
I owe you a thank you.

40:21.087 --> 40:24.558
For doing
what needed to be done.

40:24.591 --> 40:27.861
In the end, you were
always stronger than me.

40:31.665 --> 40:33.333
It's still unethical.

40:33.366 --> 40:35.969
Even if you basically
give the client
what she wants--

40:36.002 --> 40:37.470
At half the cost.

40:37.504 --> 40:38.839
Yes, at half the cost,

40:38.872 --> 40:40.406
not telling her
what you're up to.

40:40.440 --> 40:42.342
You know what
your problem is, Bec?

40:42.375 --> 40:44.177
I'm mean?

40:45.211 --> 40:48.348
You hold what we do
up on some pedestal...

40:48.381 --> 40:50.517
like it's some big thing.

40:50.551 --> 40:52.653
And isn't it?

40:55.055 --> 40:56.690
Sometimes it is.

40:58.625 --> 41:00.093
Well, maybe
with experience,

41:00.126 --> 41:02.663
one day I'll learn to be
as simple as the job.

41:02.696 --> 41:06.366
That was one of those
ironic comments.

41:06.399 --> 41:09.335
I'm not gonna analyze it.

41:09.369 --> 41:11.137
