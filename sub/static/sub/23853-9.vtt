WEBVTT

00:01.762 --> 00:04.987
You've been stealing $18 million
from me and Chet.

00:05.104 --> 00:07.573
Probably shouldn't have
put it all in an e-mail, Gary.

00:07.662 --> 00:09.644
But I own your ass now.

00:09.818 --> 00:11.986
You want the Emmy.
What do <i> you</i> want?

00:12.054 --> 00:13.058
Quinn's head.

00:13.126 --> 00:14.198
This is an opportunity.

00:14.266 --> 00:15.930
We are gonna take
Gary down.

00:16.001 --> 00:17.540
Is that Fiona?
God!

00:17.617 --> 00:20.086
I'm selling a VR company
I was running.

00:20.159 --> 00:21.992
Chet has put me in charge
of this

00:22.060 --> 00:23.110
fund-raising dinner.

00:23.178 --> 00:26.001
It's the Chet Wilson Center
for Reality Television Studies.

00:26.069 --> 00:27.127
Crystal?

00:27.325 --> 00:28.918
It's just easier,
Quinn.

00:29.633 --> 00:32.058
You really are
kind of a mess.

00:32.229 --> 00:33.591
I'm not your patient
anymore.

00:33.667 --> 00:34.754
I'm not even your child.

00:34.822 --> 00:36.832
I'm never
coming back here.

00:36.968 --> 00:38.403
George, what are you
doing here?

00:38.503 --> 00:40.849
You know, I heard what you were
saying about our relationship.

00:40.916 --> 00:42.473
It really wasn't that special.

00:42.614 --> 00:44.349
Madison,
what did you do?

00:45.134 --> 00:47.344
You're one of the smartest
people I've ever met.

00:47.838 --> 00:49.445
Hey. Whoa, whoa.
What are you doing?

00:49.514 --> 00:52.381
- What does it look like I'm doing?
- No, this is totally inappropriate.

00:52.449 --> 00:53.568
Mnh-mnh.

00:57.496 --> 00:58.691
You got a second?

Come in.

02:04.169 --> 02:06.527
Hey, so, I guess our
sessions are over

02:06.621 --> 02:08.697
since I tried to bone you
and you're not interested,

02:08.774 --> 02:10.228
so, bye.

02:10.735 --> 02:12.455
Rachel, stop.

02:12.894 --> 02:15.052
Come on in. Take a seat.

02:15.129 --> 02:16.858
I'm actually really glad you're here.

02:16.935 --> 02:18.080
Why?

02:18.232 --> 02:21.572
What happened last night
is extremely common.

02:21.703 --> 02:24.598
This works involves a lot
of trust and vulnerability,

02:24.675 --> 02:27.689
and those emotions can
be overwhelming and confusing.

02:27.757 --> 02:29.728
So, I'm basically a horny toddler?

02:29.869 --> 02:32.400
Do you want me to take a timeout
and think about what I did?

02:32.468 --> 02:34.916
All I'm saying is,
especially with your history,

02:34.984 --> 02:36.922
it's not surprising. My history.

02:36.990 --> 02:39.003
It seems like the people
you become intimate with,

02:39.071 --> 02:41.119
you tend to sexualize
your relationships.

02:41.187 --> 02:43.656
Well, I haven't had sex
for like nine months...

02:43.724 --> 02:46.312
Uh,<i> hadn't</i> had sex.

02:46.459 --> 02:47.578
Your loss.

02:47.680 --> 02:50.149
- I have options.
- I have no doubt.

02:50.450 --> 02:52.034
But the sex isn't the problem.

02:52.102 --> 02:54.492
It's using sex
to run away from intimacy.

02:54.560 --> 02:57.414
It's hard for you
to let people get close.

02:57.484 --> 02:58.688
No.

02:59.641 --> 03:00.691
No way.

03:00.759 --> 03:03.102
I have plenty of
intimate relationships.

03:04.178 --> 03:05.367
Quinn.

03:06.110 --> 03:07.143
Fine.

03:07.211 --> 03:08.250
Jay.

03:08.481 --> 03:10.656
Have you spent time with him
outside of work?

03:12.939 --> 03:14.375
Uh, Serena.

03:14.771 --> 03:17.007
Listen, I actually care
about what happens to her.

03:17.075 --> 03:19.109
I am trying to help her
get what she wants.

03:19.226 --> 03:21.132
Told her a lot of things about my life.

03:21.461 --> 03:23.359
- We are friends.
- You've known her for, what,

03:23.427 --> 03:25.351
- like, six weeks?
- I've known her eight weeks.

03:25.458 --> 03:27.802
- She's a contestant.
- That's not the point.

03:27.870 --> 03:29.414
The point is how I feel.

03:30.437 --> 03:33.375
You're just way off base
about me and intimacy, dude.

03:39.309 --> 03:41.893
To take down Gary,
we have to figure out

03:41.961 --> 03:43.775
what we're gonna do
with his e-mails.

03:43.852 --> 03:46.345
We've got to expose him
for embezzlement.

03:46.422 --> 03:47.645
The question is how.

03:47.714 --> 03:50.062
I want public shame.

03:50.621 --> 03:53.054
Abject humiliation.

03:53.130 --> 03:54.759
You know,
I want to watch that man

03:54.835 --> 03:58.554
weep into his $400 tie,
pleading for mercy.

03:58.622 --> 04:01.171
Total annihilation.
I like it.

04:02.920 --> 04:05.737
Oh, my God. I can't believe
the fundraiser is tonight.

04:05.805 --> 04:07.557
I know you guys are
used to it.

04:07.625 --> 04:08.939
It's just,
it's so much pressure.

04:09.006 --> 04:10.924
There's gonna be so many
important people here.

04:10.992 --> 04:12.015
All that press.

04:12.083 --> 04:14.070
I just want it to be so perfect.

04:14.382 --> 04:15.601
It will be perfect.

04:15.816 --> 04:18.242
Well, maybe not for Gary.

04:18.310 --> 04:19.375
No.

04:21.398 --> 04:23.234
- I'm gonna keep going.
- Okay.

04:23.340 --> 04:24.617
- Okay.
- Bye.

04:29.515 --> 04:31.493
Hey, Rach,
we're resetting.

04:31.561 --> 04:33.796
We're gonna need Serena's
sweat lodge ready in 10.

04:33.864 --> 04:36.619
- Yes. I am on it.
- Hey, I have a question for you.

04:36.804 --> 04:37.907
- Yeah?
- We're friends, right?

04:37.974 --> 04:40.507
We've known each other, like,
what is it, four years?

04:41.632 --> 04:42.836
Yeah. Four years?

04:42.905 --> 04:45.046
Yeah, and we've, like,
been in the trenches together.

04:45.114 --> 04:47.570
I mean, you know,
time invested, that's a thing.

04:47.647 --> 04:49.769
Uh, yeah.

04:49.846 --> 04:52.171
I... Actually,
I wanted to tell you,

04:52.248 --> 04:53.876
after what happened with your dad,

04:53.953 --> 04:58.514
that I had to put my dad
in a home a few years back.

04:58.591 --> 04:59.781
Had dementia.

04:59.849 --> 05:01.327
Anyways, I just wanted to tell you

05:01.395 --> 05:03.561
that as much as they're all
sick and stuff,

05:03.629 --> 05:05.650
that they still love you.
That's it.

05:05.718 --> 05:06.518
- That's all I wanted to say.
- Dan.

05:06.586 --> 05:07.711
Yeah. Yeah.

05:08.063 --> 05:09.117
Thanks.

05:09.429 --> 05:10.555
Yeah, no problem.

05:10.632 --> 05:12.869
- I, um... I do have to...
- I think that was...

05:12.937 --> 05:14.429
that was just really intimate.

05:14.497 --> 05:18.875
Cool. Just gonna...
Yep. Okay. Um...

05:20.476 --> 05:22.182
All right, so,
today's a new day.

05:22.250 --> 05:24.873
- How you feeling?
- Oh, like I completely blew it

05:24.950 --> 05:27.554
when I temporarily became
a crazy person.

05:28.516 --> 05:31.867
I mean,
I know that I have... August.

05:32.507 --> 05:33.882
What was that?

05:34.025 --> 05:36.010
Well, I, uh,
I kind of might have

05:36.078 --> 05:38.010
definitely slept
with August last night.

05:38.078 --> 05:38.830
- Really?
- Yeah.

05:38.898 --> 05:40.757
It came out of having
a crazy, awful day.

05:40.834 --> 05:42.383
Just needed something
to make myself feel better.

05:42.450 --> 05:45.148
Great. Like, I'm all for
making yourself feel better.

05:46.002 --> 05:47.344
What was <i> that?</i>

05:49.405 --> 05:54.406
I may have had a pretty shit day
myself yesterday.

05:55.069 --> 05:57.900
I'm definitely feeling better
since I slept with Alexi.

06:00.586 --> 06:01.757
Wow.

06:01.840 --> 06:04.396
Oh, you know, it's really nice
to have a single friend again.

06:04.464 --> 06:05.600
None of my married
friends will take

06:05.667 --> 06:06.919
my boy-disaster calls anymore.

06:06.987 --> 06:09.224
I'm telling you, you do not
have a boy disaster.

06:09.292 --> 06:10.896
It's crazy that
you're even saying that.

06:10.964 --> 06:13.670
Owen and Jasper wouldn't even
look me in the eye last night.

06:13.768 --> 06:15.141
You have not lost them.

06:15.209 --> 06:17.086
Listen, I helped you yesterday
with Jasper.

06:17.163 --> 06:18.892
I'm gonna fix it again
today with Owen.

06:18.969 --> 06:20.126
Don't even worry about it.

06:20.203 --> 06:21.474
I'm telling you that August,

06:21.542 --> 06:22.670
he's not your only option.

06:22.738 --> 06:23.959
Come on.

06:24.507 --> 06:25.908
You have mad skills.

06:25.976 --> 06:27.193
You know that, right?

06:27.369 --> 06:28.969
I mean, they could be
put to better use.

06:29.073 --> 06:30.449
No offense to "Everlasting."

06:30.517 --> 06:32.274
No, no. <i>All</i> offense to "Everlasting."

06:32.342 --> 06:34.171
- I'm serious.
- You should get out of here.

06:34.244 --> 06:35.631
Come work for me.

06:35.881 --> 06:38.307
Really, your CIA mind-game tricks,

06:38.384 --> 06:40.042
I mean, that is valuable.

06:40.119 --> 06:41.873
You make people do what you want.

06:41.941 --> 06:43.193
- Can I get one? Thanks.
- Sure.

06:43.261 --> 06:45.576
And then you make them think
it was their idea.

06:45.644 --> 06:46.764
That's skills.

06:46.892 --> 06:48.384
- I don't know.
- Seriously.

06:48.461 --> 06:50.823
I'll double your salary.
I'll get you an apartment.

06:50.900 --> 06:52.974
You could be home every night by 6:00.

06:53.042 --> 06:55.802
You could have friends.
You could have a life.

06:55.930 --> 06:57.590
Mm! That's a thing?

06:57.673 --> 06:59.100
- Uh-huh.
- Wow.

06:59.168 --> 07:00.254
I'm serious.

07:00.322 --> 07:02.116
I mean, you said August
isn't my only option.

07:02.210 --> 07:05.032
Well, "Everlasting" isn't yours.

07:05.149 --> 07:06.344
Think about it.

07:06.412 --> 07:08.090
Okay. I will.

07:12.665 --> 07:14.695
Tonight, Serena will choose

07:14.873 --> 07:17.996
one of her remaining three
suitors

07:18.097 --> 07:21.223
<i>to escort her to an elegant
black-tie fundraiser.</i>

07:21.348 --> 07:23.058
- <i>But first, the heat is on...</i>
- I hate Graham.

07:23.183 --> 07:25.434
<i>With "Everlasting's"
very own sweat lodge.</i>

07:25.604 --> 07:27.686
<i>What better way to sweat
out the challenges</i>

07:27.754 --> 07:29.387
<i>of each one of these relationships?</i>

07:29.554 --> 07:33.674
<i>All pores will be open
as each couple gets closer</i>

07:33.916 --> 07:40.557
<i>and, dare I say,
steamier than ever before?</i>

07:41.042 --> 07:42.819
Okay, the sweat lodge odyssey,

07:42.887 --> 07:44.942
it's very spiritual,
it's very cleansing,

07:45.010 --> 07:46.780
and it gets rid of
all the bad juju.

07:46.857 --> 07:50.213
And nobody has a problem with this
offensive cultural appropriation?

07:50.299 --> 07:51.618
What? The word "juju"?

07:51.695 --> 07:54.169
It's authentic. That's the way
we did it in Patagonia.

07:54.237 --> 07:56.723
Oh, yeah, right, at your
rich, old white man's retreat.

07:56.791 --> 07:59.192
Did you hunt the natives
for sport there, too?

07:59.260 --> 08:01.098
Okay, look,
let's just make sure

08:01.166 --> 08:03.664
our boys are
authentically shirtless.

08:03.741 --> 08:05.703
That is culturally appropriate.

08:05.854 --> 08:08.101
<i>Rachel did this
interview yesterday</i>

08:08.229 --> 08:11.848
<i>where she reduced me
to an inconsolable mass.</i>

08:12.026 --> 08:14.778
Huh. I think I like the
sound of this.

08:14.864 --> 08:16.260
Tell me more.

08:17.791 --> 08:18.845
The bottom line is,

08:18.913 --> 08:22.223
I-I judged you harshly
for the incident with George

08:22.291 --> 08:23.830
because, well,

08:24.690 --> 08:28.174
it was a convenient way
for me to sabotage myself.

08:29.369 --> 08:30.627
And that's not what I want.

08:30.776 --> 08:31.858
<i>Not even close.</i>

08:31.935 --> 08:34.885
Let me guess, Rachel, all
this groveling was your idea?

08:35.104 --> 08:37.328
What's your problem, buddy?
Jasper is golden.

08:37.405 --> 08:39.803
Yeah, of course, 'cause you're
so good at producing my guys.

08:39.880 --> 08:42.071
Hey, knock it off.
I don't care who did it.

08:42.148 --> 08:45.352
Look at these two. It's
gonna be hot, hot, hot.

08:50.029 --> 08:52.148
Once again, he's naked.

08:53.722 --> 08:56.133
What's wrong?
Are you shy all of a sudden?

08:56.258 --> 08:58.203
<i>I'm not shy, just...</i>

08:58.406 --> 09:00.227
Aren't you worried about America?

09:00.295 --> 09:02.396
<i>No. Who cares?
Look.</i>

09:02.464 --> 09:05.281
I've been in a number of
indigenous purification rituals,

09:05.349 --> 09:07.896
and... you just have to be willing
to let it all go.

09:07.973 --> 09:09.461
- Okay.
- Okay?

09:09.538 --> 09:12.250
- I can't believe you're making me do this.
- I'm not making you.

09:12.922 --> 09:14.906
- Oh!
- <i>Very brave. Thanks.</i>

09:15.039 --> 09:16.345
<i>I don't know that I
need to be this pure.</i>

09:16.412 --> 09:18.213
I also feel ridiculous.

09:18.281 --> 09:20.575
No. You know what?
You are beautiful.

09:20.652 --> 09:22.078
Open and free.

09:22.180 --> 09:23.808
<i>There's no better way to live.</i>

09:23.885 --> 09:26.323
Oh, all right, Rachel,
enough with the Crocodile Dundee.

09:26.400 --> 09:27.849
We need to get the fireman in there.

09:27.926 --> 09:30.453
Why is August still here?

09:30.620 --> 09:33.104
Isn't there, like,
a tribe in a jungle somewhere

09:33.172 --> 09:35.695
that needs him to show them
how to make shoes?

09:36.643 --> 09:38.616
I don't know, Rachel.
After what I saw yesterday...

09:38.683 --> 09:39.977
I mean, what are you waiting for?

09:40.044 --> 09:42.181
A virginal saint? Some girl
who's never had a boyfriend?

09:42.248 --> 09:45.305
Because that's called
a teenager, and that's creepy.

09:46.852 --> 09:48.570
I have Riley to think about.

09:48.638 --> 09:50.752
I-I can't just go taking risks
with who I date.

09:50.820 --> 09:52.473
Well, look, your sister
put you up for this show

09:52.540 --> 09:54.081
because you haven't been dating anyone.

09:54.148 --> 09:55.905
Relationships are a risk.

09:55.991 --> 09:58.454
Closing yourself off is no way to live

09:58.645 --> 10:00.122
for you or Riley.

10:00.215 --> 10:01.615
Okay, maybe you're right, but...

10:01.692 --> 10:04.254
Look. You like this woman.

10:04.774 --> 10:05.827
Show her.

10:05.895 --> 10:07.458
Take the risk. Open up.

10:08.058 --> 10:09.997
Now take your shirt off,
and get in there.

10:14.034 --> 10:16.153
<i>So, I'm just gonna go ahead</i>

10:16.223 --> 10:18.309
<i>and address the George nightmare.</i>

10:18.723 --> 10:20.465
<i>It was not me at my best,</i>

10:20.533 --> 10:23.095
and out of everyone, I am the
most embarrassed in front of you.

10:23.168 --> 10:24.168
Why me?

10:24.236 --> 10:26.215
Uh, because you're perfect.

10:26.332 --> 10:27.411
<i>I mean, you are.</i>

10:27.479 --> 10:29.148
- This girl's sad.
- <i>You're, like, this stand-up guy</i>

10:29.215 --> 10:30.576
<i>with this perfect daughter</i>

10:30.653 --> 10:33.254
<i>and this perfect body, clearly.</i>

10:33.989 --> 10:36.098
<i>You're like the moral center here.</i>

10:36.223 --> 10:38.981
<i>Well, I hate to burst your
bubble, but I'm not perfect.</i>

10:39.101 --> 10:41.570
I mean, I was gone for a lot
of my daughter's life.

10:41.638 --> 10:44.527
Yeah, fighting a war,
serving your country.

10:44.663 --> 10:48.554
Yeah, and nobody gets out of
that without some scar tissue.

10:49.548 --> 10:51.669
<i>Well, what is it?</i>

10:51.875 --> 10:54.578
I-I try not to talk about it.
It's just...

10:55.312 --> 10:56.390
I totally...

10:56.707 --> 10:59.635
Um, I totally get
if you don't talk about it,

10:59.714 --> 11:02.578
<i>but, you know,
my dad was in Vietnam,</i>

11:02.991 --> 11:06.288
<i>and, um, yeah, he doesn't like
to talk about it, either.</i>

11:06.481 --> 11:10.437
<i>But it made it really hard
for me to be close to him.</i>

11:11.586 --> 11:14.336
<i>I want you to feel like
you can tell me everything.</i>

11:20.531 --> 11:23.945
We were on a-a routine patrol one night

11:24.788 --> 11:26.359
when we were ambushed.

11:26.765 --> 11:29.414
<i>Impossible to tell friendlies
from insurgents.</i>

11:29.515 --> 11:31.359
<i>We were lucky to get out alive.</i>

11:32.546 --> 11:37.198
Next morning, we were tasked
to reclear the objective.

11:39.616 --> 11:43.287
And... there's this little girl there...

11:44.697 --> 11:48.725
sit-sitting by
her mother's dead body,

11:49.675 --> 11:51.701
staring into space...

11:52.787 --> 11:56.506
and blood and dirt on her face
and her... her clothes.

12:04.488 --> 12:06.316
<i>I have nightmares some nights.</i>

12:06.558 --> 12:09.084
<i>I-I see the same look on Riley's face.</i>

12:09.967 --> 12:11.707
<i>It's not your fault, Owen.</i>

12:11.784 --> 12:13.366
<i>It is, though.</i>

12:13.783 --> 12:15.592
<i>I'll never not feel responsible.</i>

12:15.822 --> 12:18.576
<i>We took her mom from her.</i>

12:19.397 --> 12:20.756
<i>It's okay. It's okay.</i>

12:20.890 --> 12:23.385
Yes. This is what we want.
This is what we need.

12:23.462 --> 12:25.150
Man tears! Yes!

12:25.227 --> 12:27.056
It's a little sad, don't you think?

12:27.133 --> 12:28.170
Sad? No.

12:28.238 --> 12:29.567
This wounded warrior shit,

12:29.650 --> 12:31.638
it's, like,
definition of pussy magnet.

12:31.706 --> 12:33.678
Okay, whatever,
but Jasper played great.

12:33.873 --> 12:35.928
Duh. I mean,
money plus accent

12:36.005 --> 12:37.067
equals Final Two,

12:37.144 --> 12:39.102
but Owen is the one
that needs our help.

12:39.170 --> 12:42.647
We got to convince Serena that
he can fit into her world, so...

12:42.715 --> 12:45.483
Rachel, uh,
you need to tell your girl

12:45.561 --> 12:47.606
that she's gotta pick
Daddy Do-Right.

12:47.683 --> 12:48.906
Hey, look. I don't know.

12:48.983 --> 12:50.046
She's still pretty into August.

12:50.113 --> 12:52.590
Hey, listen,
I need a class warfare finale.

12:52.658 --> 12:54.112
Jasper versus Owen.

12:54.189 --> 12:56.795
Right? It's like "Downton
Abbey," but with a hot fireman.

12:56.872 --> 12:59.141
I mean, I would watch the shit
out of that, wouldn't you?

12:59.218 --> 13:00.218
Mm-hmm.

13:00.294 --> 13:02.020
Okay. We're all set.

13:02.162 --> 13:04.726
I got Gary seated at a table
with all the reporters...

13:04.834 --> 13:06.627
<i>Buzzfeed,</i> even <i>The New York Times.</i>

13:06.733 --> 13:08.059
Nice.

13:08.136 --> 13:10.028
As soon as he gets up
to make his speech,

13:10.105 --> 13:12.466
we blast out all the e-mails,
we prove he embezzled.

13:12.543 --> 13:14.902
They're gonna be on him
like a pack of wolves.

13:14.979 --> 13:16.099
You know, I forgot

13:16.176 --> 13:18.005
what a duplicitous asshole you could be.

13:18.082 --> 13:20.204
Who do you think taught you,
huh?

13:20.771 --> 13:23.464
Hey, Chetty. Madison just said you
changed the whole seating charts.

13:23.651 --> 13:26.410
Why would you do that to me? Like,
I had individualized press kits.

13:26.487 --> 13:27.726
Now I don't know where to put them.

13:27.793 --> 13:29.491
Look. Just give them to Madison.

13:29.565 --> 13:31.525
She can hand them out to
the reporters as they come in.

13:31.592 --> 13:33.283
Yeah, they'll have them
before they sit down.

13:33.350 --> 13:35.255
- Tweet during cocktail hour.
- Mm-hmm.

13:35.475 --> 13:36.653
That is a great idea.

13:36.730 --> 13:38.592
You guys are really amazing
at this. Bye.

13:38.733 --> 13:40.842
- Mwah. Bye.
- Bye, bye, bye.

13:41.006 --> 13:42.201
Bye.

13:48.357 --> 13:50.140
Oh, really?

13:51.274 --> 13:53.069
We are amazing at this.

13:53.444 --> 13:54.951
Always have been.

13:56.798 --> 13:59.733
See? CIA.

13:59.816 --> 14:00.763
I don't know how you do it,

14:00.831 --> 14:03.035
but all three of these guys
are actually on board.

14:03.103 --> 14:04.013
I'm not worthy.

14:04.090 --> 14:05.451
I wish I could take credit for it,

14:05.519 --> 14:07.010
but they're actually here for you.

14:07.263 --> 14:08.733
So, let's talk about tonight.

14:08.841 --> 14:10.743
Well, I think
I have to choose August.

14:10.811 --> 14:12.423
- Mm.
- I mean, I know you're gonna say

14:12.491 --> 14:15.128
it's 'cause he was in here
and he was all naked and sweaty

14:15.205 --> 14:18.964
and we had sex
and he's just so hot.

14:19.033 --> 14:21.472
Yes, yes, and yes, yes.

14:21.548 --> 14:24.970
But I really... I think...
I think he might be the one.

14:25.150 --> 14:29.191
I think he could balance out
my crazy life, you know?

14:29.259 --> 14:31.408
Ground me. Show me how to live.

14:32.087 --> 14:34.418
I am complicated enough
for two people.

14:34.486 --> 14:36.681
- Mm-hmm.
- I think he might be exactly what I need.

14:36.758 --> 14:39.298
What? What is it?

14:39.757 --> 14:41.716
Quinn really wants it to be
Owen.

14:41.947 --> 14:43.707
I mean,
that whole story he told.

14:43.775 --> 14:45.257
I know. He's incredible.

14:45.580 --> 14:48.022
But I don't care what Quinn wants.

14:48.259 --> 14:50.095
These are my real feelings, here.

14:50.306 --> 14:53.525
She doesn't care about my life,
but I know you do.

14:56.072 --> 14:57.603
You know what?

14:57.853 --> 14:58.923
Hmm?

14:59.923 --> 15:01.034
Screw it.

15:01.291 --> 15:02.433
Just go with your gut.

15:02.501 --> 15:04.108
- Yeah?
- Yeah, August it is.

15:04.185 --> 15:05.126
- Really?
- Yeah.

15:05.194 --> 15:07.085
You're just gonna
break ranks like that?

15:07.153 --> 15:09.689
- What are you gonna tell Quinn?
- That you're my girl.

15:09.757 --> 15:12.191
Come on.
This is your life, Serena.

15:12.259 --> 15:13.885
What's the worst
that she's gonna do to me?

15:13.952 --> 15:15.447
Throw pillar candles
at my head?

15:15.580 --> 15:17.201
Bring it on.

15:19.321 --> 15:20.798
God, you look so good in a tux.

15:20.866 --> 15:22.157
I could just eat you up.

15:22.317 --> 15:24.019
- When we have time...
- Mm-hmm.

15:24.087 --> 15:25.918
Do you want to go,
you know, upstairs?

15:25.995 --> 15:28.465
Oh. Well, you know, you put
this whole party together,

15:28.533 --> 15:30.212
and I want to see
the hors d'oeuvres.

15:30.283 --> 15:32.279
I know, and they better get it
right, 'cause there's this...

15:32.346 --> 15:33.908
- Hi. How are you?
- Hey.

15:34.008 --> 15:36.305
This catering guy was giving me
all kinds of hassle

15:36.373 --> 15:38.080
<i>about the salmon puffs,
which I know</i>

15:38.148 --> 15:41.876
<i>that I ordered instead of stuffed
mushrooms because I hate mushrooms.</i>

15:42.017 --> 15:44.206
<i>Anyway, I'm pretty sure
I've sorted all of it out.</i>

15:44.392 --> 15:46.438
<i>I've got candles
still coming through there</i>

15:46.515 --> 15:48.043
<i>and the lower flower arrangements,</i>

15:48.181 --> 15:49.857
the taller ones for there.

15:53.114 --> 15:54.481
What?

15:58.093 --> 16:00.434
Are you seriously back
with Chet,

16:01.012 --> 16:03.311
or are you planning some
kind of twisted threesome

16:03.379 --> 16:04.788
with him and
fundraiser Barbie?

16:04.856 --> 16:07.094
I don't know
what you're talking about.

16:07.332 --> 16:09.028
He's a loser, Quinn...

16:09.336 --> 16:11.568
And he's just gonna drag
you down like he has for years.

16:11.754 --> 16:14.692
Uh, first, no one drags me anywhere.

16:14.816 --> 16:17.475
And second, Chet and I
are not back together.

16:17.543 --> 16:19.109
And third, it's none
of your damn business.

16:19.176 --> 16:20.109
Okay.

16:20.186 --> 16:23.007
Now, how about
you tell me

16:23.075 --> 16:25.513
what you're doing here
so early, huh?

16:25.676 --> 16:29.093
Actually, I, um...
I need a favor.

16:29.161 --> 16:31.081
Mm. Shoot.

16:34.770 --> 16:37.356
I got some bad news
about my VR company.

16:37.512 --> 16:40.811
Our Chinese buyer
who was 100% in

16:40.879 --> 16:43.129
is apparently 100% out.

16:43.309 --> 16:44.932
Ooh. That sucks.

16:45.009 --> 16:47.567
Yeah, which means...

16:48.114 --> 16:49.388
I need a job.

16:51.106 --> 16:54.582
Yeah, I thought I wasn't
premium enough for you.

16:55.012 --> 16:56.066
Okay.

16:56.839 --> 16:58.387
I deserve that.

16:58.973 --> 17:01.395
But I wouldn't be asking
if I didn't really need it.

17:01.653 --> 17:06.387
Uh now is not a good time.

17:06.777 --> 17:12.231
There's some volatility
in my situation, actually.

17:12.457 --> 17:14.675
It's not personal.

17:14.934 --> 17:16.973
It's just business.

17:19.844 --> 17:21.944
I'm sorry.

17:26.143 --> 17:27.390
Follow me.

17:28.597 --> 17:30.512
Tonight on "Everlasting,"

17:30.942 --> 17:32.934
we will be raising
your blood pressure

17:33.075 --> 17:34.850
with three black-tie lady killers

17:34.918 --> 17:36.692
and one red-hot lady.

17:36.762 --> 17:39.225
We're also raising
sweet green cashola

17:39.293 --> 17:40.436
for the groundbreaking

17:40.504 --> 17:44.286
Chet Wilton School
of Reality TV Studies.

17:44.489 --> 17:46.617
Now, as for our gorgeous suitress,

17:46.996 --> 17:50.061
Serena has selected
August as her date,

17:50.129 --> 17:52.905
but our two remaining studs
will be out there among you,

17:52.973 --> 17:54.733
competing
for donations in their name.

17:54.810 --> 17:56.464
Whoever raises the most money

17:56.622 --> 17:58.246
will, of course,
escort Serena home tonight

17:58.313 --> 18:00.739
to make one last play for her hand

18:00.839 --> 18:04.411
ahead of our elimination ceremony.

18:06.735 --> 18:08.952
If Serena wanted August
as her date,

18:09.020 --> 18:10.458
what are these
other guys doing here?

18:10.525 --> 18:12.016
Shockingly, Quinn didn't love

18:12.093 --> 18:13.917
you not delivering on her choice,

18:13.994 --> 18:16.059
so this was my idea.

18:16.153 --> 18:18.082
What is with your attitude?

18:18.295 --> 18:19.923
No, honestly.
We've been cool all season.

18:20.000 --> 18:22.608
No, Rachel,
<i>you've</i> been cool all season

18:22.676 --> 18:24.552
because you've been doing
whatever the hell you want.

18:24.619 --> 18:27.094
Jay, this is ridiculous. So, she
doesn't pick me for the date,

18:27.162 --> 18:29.491
and now I have to pimp myself
out for some absurd building?

18:29.559 --> 18:31.536
You clean up nice,
my friend.

18:31.840 --> 18:34.262
Now, why don't you take
your fetching ass out there,

18:34.372 --> 18:36.801
raise a disgusting
amount of money,

18:36.918 --> 18:38.538
and show Serena
what a mistake she made?

18:38.668 --> 18:41.211
Making a lot of money is actually
a personal forte of mine.

18:41.411 --> 18:43.864
- Good boy.
- Thank you, man. Let's do this.

18:45.407 --> 18:46.731
Damn it.

18:49.840 --> 18:50.850
- Dan.
- What's up?

18:50.927 --> 18:52.055
What is up Jay's ass?

18:52.132 --> 18:53.641
He's being a total dick.

18:53.718 --> 18:55.725
I mean, like, yeah,
I know I deserve it sometimes.

18:55.802 --> 18:58.240
But this time, it's, like,
literally out of nowhere.

18:59.274 --> 19:00.729
You know what?
We should get together.

19:00.796 --> 19:02.351
We should have a beer
sometime

19:02.419 --> 19:03.816
and talk about anything
other than work.

19:03.883 --> 19:07.674
You know, like our dads
or just, like, our lives, right?

19:08.305 --> 19:09.565
Talk about our lives?

19:09.633 --> 19:11.502
Yeah. Yeah. Maybe tomorrow.

19:11.570 --> 19:13.117
- I mean, if you're free, okay?
- Uh...

19:13.185 --> 19:15.891
- I'll talk to you soon.
- Just... Um... Okay.

19:29.462 --> 19:32.399
If you don't take him,
Missy, I will.

19:35.036 --> 19:36.531
Serena!

19:36.891 --> 19:38.422
Why don't you come here?

19:38.807 --> 19:39.914
Serena!

19:40.037 --> 19:43.617
This lovely couple here
is willing to donate $25,000

19:43.711 --> 19:46.180
if you climb up on this table
right now and kiss me.

19:46.266 --> 19:49.531
Ladies and gentlemen, how could she
refuse this for such a good cause?

19:56.180 --> 19:57.480
The eagle has landed.

19:57.557 --> 19:59.299
Well, the eagle's
about to be road kill.

19:59.367 --> 20:00.768
Let him get a drink first.

20:00.836 --> 20:02.971
Hey, buddy, how are you?

20:03.039 --> 20:05.590
Good to see you. Hey, let's get a drink.
How was the traffic?

20:05.667 --> 20:07.795
Uh, traffic was fine, thank you.

20:07.872 --> 20:08.872
Oh, heads up.

20:08.940 --> 20:10.030
- Hi.
- Robin.

20:10.107 --> 20:11.161
Hi.

20:11.238 --> 20:12.473
What the hell is she doing here?

20:12.540 --> 20:13.644
You want me to get security?

20:13.711 --> 20:16.266
No. No, I'll... I'll handle it.

20:16.343 --> 20:18.930
Uh, I didn't know
you two knew each other.

20:19.117 --> 20:20.173
Lesbian mafia.

20:20.250 --> 20:22.172
Mm, small world.

20:22.250 --> 20:24.188
Can I talk to you for a second?

20:25.077 --> 20:27.328
Waiter! Get her a drink.

20:29.122 --> 20:31.156
I'm pretty sure last time
you were here,

20:31.224 --> 20:33.279
I kicked your ass off my set.

20:33.520 --> 20:35.706
- Hmm.
- I'm wearing my Manolos this time,

20:35.774 --> 20:37.157
and I am happy to do it again.

20:37.234 --> 20:40.867
Actually, I'm here
as a guest of Gary's.

20:41.479 --> 20:42.566
Hi.

20:42.642 --> 20:43.774
Hi.

20:45.664 --> 20:47.345
Don't get comfortable.

20:49.575 --> 20:51.734
Excuse me, gentlemen.
I'm sorry.

20:51.890 --> 20:54.073
Quinn, what a spectacular party.

20:54.141 --> 20:55.695
Cut the crap, Gary.

20:55.859 --> 20:57.373
What is Robin doing here?

20:57.450 --> 20:59.912
Oh, Robin is here to cover
your retirement speech.

20:59.989 --> 21:01.042
My what?

21:01.126 --> 21:04.274
Yes, tonight, I'll be announcing
you're forgoing your overall deal

21:04.344 --> 21:07.367
and leaving "Everlasting"
effective immediately.

21:07.602 --> 21:09.031
I'll be glad to tell 'em
whatever you'd like,

21:09.098 --> 21:12.385
you know, that you want to spend
more time with family or...

21:12.453 --> 21:14.328
Oh, wait. No, that wouldn't
work, would it?

21:14.396 --> 21:16.664
But I'm sure you'll come up
with something. Scotch, neat.

21:16.732 --> 21:17.775
You know, I think you're having

21:17.842 --> 21:19.882
that mental breakdown
we've always known was coming.

21:20.202 --> 21:21.362
Well, you'll do it.

21:21.439 --> 21:24.135
It's your last chance
to leave with dignity.

21:24.375 --> 21:27.274
Robin's article lays out
all the dirt on you,

21:27.961 --> 21:29.891
so I'm gonna fire you tonight,

21:30.016 --> 21:33.000
along with a harshly worded
condemnation from network.

21:33.243 --> 21:36.605
Why? Because Robin claims that I don't
play well with women? Who cares?

21:36.690 --> 21:39.546
No, because along with all that,

21:39.758 --> 21:41.174
Robin has discovered...

21:41.242 --> 21:44.836
Well, actually, maybe I
told her that, um, there's a lot more

21:44.904 --> 21:47.063
you've been hiding
here at "Everlasting,"

21:47.180 --> 21:49.713
and I realized I don't need Chet

21:49.781 --> 21:52.406
to get me proof of your misdeeds
to bring you down

21:52.656 --> 21:56.442
because women like you
can't afford to make mistakes.

21:56.719 --> 21:58.063
- Remember?
- Hmm.

21:58.131 --> 22:01.781
Uh, you seem to be forgetting about
a little thing called leverage.

22:02.266 --> 22:03.916
All those e-mails that I have

22:03.984 --> 22:07.086
proving that you embezzled money
from us and the studio?

22:07.154 --> 22:10.133
The press here is gonna eat them up.

22:10.750 --> 22:12.315
<i>I'm</i> not going down tonight, Gary.

22:12.672 --> 22:13.863
<i>You</i> are.

22:15.977 --> 22:19.635
How confident are you that, uh,
you still have those e-mails?

22:31.281 --> 22:32.564
What?

22:32.641 --> 22:34.033
What?!

22:42.377 --> 22:43.930
Only 10 minutes left to bid

22:43.998 --> 22:46.094
on your favorite suitor,
ladies and gents.

22:46.236 --> 22:47.956
Coming up, I will usher in

22:48.024 --> 22:50.198
the head of
our esteemed network.

22:50.266 --> 22:52.893
Mr. Gary Taylor is with us
this evening, everybody,

22:52.961 --> 22:54.666
to make
an exciting announcement

22:54.734 --> 22:57.422
about the future of
"Everlasting."

22:57.704 --> 22:59.148
What's the announcement?
Is it about me?

22:59.215 --> 23:00.215
Yeah.

23:00.330 --> 23:02.209
I need you right now.

23:02.388 --> 23:04.670
Look, okay, fine. Quinn,
whatever it is, can it just wait

23:04.748 --> 23:07.233
until after the bidding is over?
I mean, I know you don't like it,

23:07.300 --> 23:08.812
but I'm trying to help Serena
find a husband.

23:08.879 --> 23:11.826
Screw Serena. Gary is going
to retire me tonight.

23:11.894 --> 23:12.905
What?

23:12.973 --> 23:15.178
Gary cannot get up on
that stage, or I am done.

23:15.331 --> 23:17.486
Seriously, Quinn,
what are you talking about?

23:17.631 --> 23:20.160
I need you to create a distraction
of biblical proportions

23:20.237 --> 23:23.431
'cause I have to go deal with
that cockroach of a reporter.

23:23.508 --> 23:26.213
She is a contestant, Rachel. Come on.

23:26.830 --> 23:29.791
This life, this career,
this is all I have.

23:31.543 --> 23:34.486
We both saw Owen's date today.
You know you can use that.

23:37.067 --> 23:38.190
Come on.

23:38.580 --> 23:40.065
Please.

23:45.289 --> 23:46.814
I got you.

23:51.460 --> 23:52.783
Everything okay?

23:54.010 --> 23:57.387
- Ladies, hi.
- Hi.

23:57.464 --> 23:59.981
Do you guys mind if I borrow
August for just one second?

24:00.049 --> 24:01.134
I promise I'll bring him right back.

24:01.201 --> 24:02.298
- What's up?
- It's a surprise.

24:02.365 --> 24:03.689
- One second.
- One second.

24:03.774 --> 24:06.619
This way. Thanks, guys.
He'll be right back.

24:07.150 --> 24:08.323
I'll meet you right outside.

24:08.398 --> 24:11.065
Hey, I need to do a down and
dirty, one-on-one interview, so...

24:11.133 --> 24:11.938
- Right now?
- Yeah.

24:12.006 --> 24:13.454
- We're right in the middle of a...
- No, listen. Quinn wants to create,

24:13.521 --> 24:15.845
some, like, real competition between
August and Owen. Take the camera.

24:15.912 --> 24:18.221
- All right. What about the crew?
- Let's just... Come on. Here we go.

24:18.288 --> 24:19.478
Uh, walk with me.

24:19.720 --> 24:22.648
How you doing, Quinn?
You look a little pale.

24:22.725 --> 24:23.701
How much?

24:23.778 --> 24:24.806
Excuse me?

24:24.941 --> 24:27.476
- To kill the article. How much?
- Oh, that.

24:27.593 --> 24:30.155
I already gave it to my editor,
so it's out of my hands.

24:30.232 --> 24:32.128
Meaning it's going
to put you on the map,

24:32.205 --> 24:34.231
so you're not going to stop it.

24:34.384 --> 24:36.579
One career ends, another begins.

24:36.798 --> 24:39.298
You know, the magazine business
is on life support.

24:39.375 --> 24:41.300
We both know
it can't be your end game.

24:41.377 --> 24:44.134
I can get you a real platform,

24:44.712 --> 24:48.111
a nightly primetime spot on one
of our cable news networks.

24:48.347 --> 24:51.072
I could sell your whole shtick
in a heartbeat.

24:51.151 --> 24:53.482
I don't need you to sell my shtick.

24:53.661 --> 24:55.981
I've been taking meetings,
and once this profile comes out,

24:56.058 --> 24:58.033
I'll probably be taking a lot more.

24:58.260 --> 25:00.064
Such a sweet offer, though.

25:00.415 --> 25:01.642
A few more moves like this,

25:01.710 --> 25:04.330
and I'm sure you'll rehab
that image in no time.

25:07.704 --> 25:08.900
Sorry to pull you out of there,

25:08.967 --> 25:11.908
but Quinn is just up my ass about
getting them. You know how she is.

25:12.146 --> 25:14.505
- Yep. Yeah. Right.
- You guys all look so great.

25:14.597 --> 25:18.691
You guys are in your tuxes,
um, except for, uh, Owen.

25:18.774 --> 25:20.602
He's not in his tux. What
do you... How do you feel

25:20.669 --> 25:22.539
about him wearing
his military uniform tonight?

25:22.697 --> 25:25.306
- I mean, I know that you're a pacifist.
- Yeah, I am.

25:25.478 --> 25:28.179
Um, all right. I'm not really into
the military's mission myself,

25:28.256 --> 25:30.134
but I just try to live and let live.

25:30.202 --> 25:31.690
Owen's not a bad guy.

25:31.782 --> 25:33.889
I'm sure he believes
in what he did over there.

25:33.957 --> 25:36.120
What do you think he did? I mean,
I know that we've all seen

25:36.187 --> 25:38.923
the pictures of those dead children.
I mean, Owen wouldn't...

25:38.995 --> 25:40.520
In any war, every soldier has

25:40.606 --> 25:42.201
some responsibility for
what happens.

25:42.269 --> 25:45.061
But most people think that the
troops are unbelievably brave.

25:45.138 --> 25:47.392
Look, I can't think
of anything more brave

25:47.571 --> 25:49.199
than standing up
for what I believe in,

25:49.276 --> 25:51.497
which is the dignity of human life.

25:51.574 --> 25:54.070
I mean, soldiers enforce
fear and submission.

25:54.147 --> 25:55.972
I've worked all around the world

25:56.049 --> 25:57.470
to promote peace.

25:57.846 --> 25:59.674
I've been out there on the front line.

25:59.853 --> 26:02.134
Yeah, but not like
a veteran has, not really.

26:02.222 --> 26:04.614
<i>More</i> than a veteran has,
and I was unarmed.

26:04.736 --> 26:06.579
What is weak is hiding

26:06.656 --> 26:08.885
behind a uniform and armor
and machine guns,

26:08.953 --> 26:10.806
and then you go
and call yourself a hero?

26:10.874 --> 26:13.400
Sorry, but that's
my definition of cowardice.

26:14.460 --> 26:17.251
Uh, are we done?

26:18.173 --> 26:19.564
Yep.

26:22.282 --> 26:24.244
That guy has no idea what
he's talking about, Rachel.

26:24.311 --> 26:26.666
My brother died fighting over there
so some Aussie can come over here

26:26.733 --> 26:28.646
on some reality television
show and say that shit?

26:28.713 --> 26:31.283
Okay, I know. We're definitely gonna
give Owen a chance to respond.

26:31.350 --> 26:33.051
'Cause he's spouting
that bullshit like it's gospel.

26:33.118 --> 26:34.654
We need to get Owen's response,
like, now.

26:34.721 --> 26:36.369
- Let's do it.
- All right.

26:36.486 --> 26:38.479
You know what? No, no, no.
The speech is about to start.

26:38.546 --> 26:39.501
Listen, we'll get it later.

26:39.569 --> 26:41.008
If not, we'll definitely
get it for the next episode.

26:41.075 --> 26:43.244
No, no, Rach, this can't
air without a response.

26:43.312 --> 26:46.408
- You can't let that air.
- We're just running out of time.

26:51.199 --> 26:53.528
Owen, hey, dude, I thought
you'd want to see this.

26:53.605 --> 26:55.427
We just did an interview with August.

26:55.504 --> 26:56.523
Look, he's saying all

26:56.591 --> 26:57.917
- this shit about the military.
- <i>Look, in any war,</i>

26:57.984 --> 26:59.339
<i>every soldier
has .</i>

26:59.414 --> 27:00.913
- It's disrespectful, man.
- <i>some responsibility..</i>

27:00.980 --> 27:03.568
Look, in any war,
This is bullshit. Yeah. Yeah.

27:03.676 --> 27:05.460
Ladies and gentlemen, uh, please,

27:05.554 --> 27:08.531
help me welcome Gary Taylor!

27:09.984 --> 27:11.274
- Nice to see you again.
- Thank you.

27:11.341 --> 27:12.374
This is for you.

27:12.442 --> 27:14.103
What a great evening, huh?

27:14.291 --> 27:15.874
Isn't this a great evening?

27:16.101 --> 27:18.966
And some surprises yet to come.

27:20.048 --> 27:21.828
We have had a wild ride...

27:21.896 --> 27:24.291
Hey, what the hell have you been
saying about me, man?

27:24.359 --> 27:26.446
I don't want to be involved in
any aggression, all right, mate?

27:26.513 --> 27:28.421
I'm defending myself <i>against</i> aggression.

27:28.532 --> 27:31.218
Against your attack on the military
I risked my life serving in.

27:31.286 --> 27:32.779
You got a problem with that?
Say it to my face.

27:32.846 --> 27:35.289
Yeah, I do have a problem with it, okay?
That's what pacifism is.

27:35.356 --> 27:37.835
Turn off the stage Mic and
turn up the contestants' lavs.

27:37.903 --> 27:40.066
- Put 'em through the speakers now!
- What about them?

27:40.258 --> 27:41.984
- It's not that simple, man.
- Oh, it's not?

27:42.052 --> 27:43.788
<i>There are sick individuals in this world</i>

27:43.969 --> 27:45.329
who prey on the weak and vulnerable.

27:45.396 --> 27:47.248
Somebody's gotta stop 'em,
and I'm sorry,

27:47.316 --> 27:49.796
but they don't exactly respond
to incense and drum circles.

27:49.864 --> 27:51.383
- This is great.
- But how many people have you hurt

27:51.450 --> 27:54.029
or killed because you had the power
of deadly weapons, mate?

27:54.097 --> 27:56.570
How many women, Owen?
How many children?

27:56.792 --> 27:59.951
If I were you,
I would shut my mouth right now.

28:00.169 --> 28:03.749
What if your daughter
was a little Iraqi girl?

28:03.902 --> 28:05.875
Would those Iraqis matter to you then?

28:06.054 --> 28:08.196
I'm not gonna fight you, mate,
all right? I've got principles.

28:08.263 --> 28:09.905
Oh, yeah, it's easy to
hide behind principles

28:09.972 --> 28:11.386
when you have the privilege
of living in a bubble

28:11.453 --> 28:12.620
where you never had to make
hard choices.

28:12.687 --> 28:16.083
No. Be honest, mate. This is who you
really are... a fighting machine.

28:16.288 --> 28:19.687
The military took your humanity.
They made you all killers.

28:24.404 --> 28:26.162
Oh, my God!

28:26.270 --> 28:28.311
- Ho!
- Owen, come on, man.

28:29.795 --> 28:31.753
All right. All right. Take it easy!

28:32.266 --> 28:33.840
Get him out of here! Let's go!

28:35.793 --> 28:37.974
<i>- Take him away.
- Get him out of here.</i>

28:39.504 --> 28:41.038
I owe you one, Goldberg.

28:41.238 --> 28:43.700
Your boy, Owen, might not come
out of this looking so good.

28:43.777 --> 28:47.624
Well, don't worry.
I can definitely work with this.

29:05.969 --> 29:08.580
What an eventful and yet sobering night

29:08.656 --> 29:09.880
here at "Everlasting."

29:09.957 --> 29:12.215
In light of this, we're having
a change of plans.

29:12.422 --> 29:13.580
We will be honoring our vets

29:13.648 --> 29:14.825
for the remainder of the evening.

29:14.892 --> 29:16.640
If you would, please,
all of you, I'd love it

29:16.707 --> 29:18.889
if you would don your blue ribbons

29:19.085 --> 29:21.224
which, as of today,
will commemorate veterans

29:21.301 --> 29:22.792
and the struggles that they face

29:22.869 --> 29:24.697
not on the battlefield, but and at home.

29:24.953 --> 29:26.463
Thank you.

Come on, Rachel. I mean, Quinn
produced all of that, right?

29:45.593 --> 29:48.047
That wasn't like Owen at all, and
the stuff that August was saying,

29:48.114 --> 29:51.515
I mean, she pushed it way too far.
Using what Owen told me earlier?

29:51.583 --> 29:53.984
I mean, that's... that's despicable.
Who does that?

29:57.102 --> 30:00.257
No, you're right, yeah, that
was really mean, but, um...

30:02.790 --> 30:04.163
it wasn't Quinn.

30:05.601 --> 30:07.925
Look. I saw Jeremy. He
was, like, talking to Owen

30:08.010 --> 30:09.938
after this interview
that I did with August.

30:10.006 --> 30:11.149
He probably just set him off.

30:11.216 --> 30:13.361
Okay, yeah, but Quinn is very
happy to capitalize on it

30:13.428 --> 30:15.632
and turn this entire evening
into a farce.

30:15.703 --> 30:16.982
This is what I'm talking about.

30:17.059 --> 30:18.547
This is why you need
to come work for me.

30:18.614 --> 30:21.218
A fist fight does not make it
a good night.

30:25.597 --> 30:27.588
Blame it on Jeremy. That's cute.

30:27.781 --> 30:31.663
You do realize this whole mess reeks
of vintage Rachel Goldberg, right?

30:32.136 --> 30:33.764
So much for essential honesty.

30:33.841 --> 30:37.929
Look, I didn't...
I knew it was bad, but...

30:39.833 --> 30:41.405
Quinn just needed help.

30:41.679 --> 30:43.054
There it is.

30:43.281 --> 30:47.411
It's just so easy for you to
rationalize your god-awful behavior.

30:47.749 --> 30:50.614
Did Quinn need you to screw
Alexi last night, too?

30:50.691 --> 30:52.570
How do you even know...

30:52.990 --> 30:55.248
And why do you even care
if I slept with Alexi?

30:55.325 --> 30:57.154
Because I broke up with Xavier for him.

30:57.240 --> 30:58.885
- What?
- We had a thing, Rachel,

30:58.953 --> 31:01.796
it was happening,
and, um,

31:02.093 --> 31:04.437
I thought he cared about me
until he told me

31:04.505 --> 31:07.201
in no uncertain terms that he didn't,

31:07.488 --> 31:09.780
and then he screwed you.

31:09.911 --> 31:12.233
Jay, look, I'm so sorry.

31:12.342 --> 31:14.335
- I didn't mean to...
- You never mean to.

31:22.685 --> 31:24.656
Dan, hey.

31:24.948 --> 31:26.776
That was a pretty intense fight, huh?

31:26.893 --> 31:29.348
Uh, yeah, yep.

31:29.859 --> 31:31.721
You have a minute to talk?

31:32.422 --> 31:33.976
Like, now?

31:46.775 --> 31:48.440
What are we doing?

31:48.508 --> 31:50.033
What? What do you mean?

31:50.101 --> 31:51.382
You brought me in here
and started...

31:51.449 --> 31:53.288
We aren't really friends, are we?

31:55.648 --> 31:57.876
To be honest, Rachel,
I think you're the...

31:58.218 --> 32:00.335
scariest person I've ever met.

32:04.175 --> 32:05.837
That was stupid.

32:06.132 --> 32:08.786
Quinn. Well done tonight.

32:08.984 --> 32:12.427
Yeah, your, uh, convenient,
little brawl saved you for now,

32:12.504 --> 32:15.734
but, uh, that article is coming out.

32:15.903 --> 32:18.566
And when it does, the network
will be licking my balls,

32:18.643 --> 32:19.897
begging me to fire you,

32:19.974 --> 32:22.036
and I will be only too happy to oblige.

32:22.113 --> 32:24.001
Just go home, Gary,

32:24.171 --> 32:27.710
and don't ever mention your
balls to me or anybody ever.

32:28.367 --> 32:30.044
Soon, my dear.

32:30.199 --> 32:32.070
Soon!

32:35.122 --> 32:39.291
Tonight, only two men will receive

32:39.359 --> 32:41.755
our one-of-a-kind, limited edition,

32:41.832 --> 32:47.557
gold-plated Chet Wilton School
of Reality TV Studies cufflinks.

32:47.710 --> 32:50.230
Now it is time for Serena to decide

32:50.307 --> 32:53.984
which man will leave empty-wristed.

32:54.212 --> 32:55.532
Serena?

32:55.742 --> 32:58.226
Before you begin,
I have to say something.

32:58.531 --> 33:02.245
I am so deeply sorry
for what happened here tonight.

33:02.315 --> 33:05.632
I acted in a way that makes me
ashamed to call myself a soldier.

33:06.489 --> 33:09.445
August, you have the right
to express your opinions.

33:09.723 --> 33:11.418
Hell, that's what I fought for.

33:11.628 --> 33:15.502
Serena, I am so sorry
for any pain that I caused you.

33:15.570 --> 33:18.521
I just lost control. I think the
only way for me to move forward

33:18.607 --> 33:21.234
is to eliminate myself
from this competition.

33:21.413 --> 33:22.784
It's been a pleasure
getting to know you,

33:22.851 --> 33:24.624
and I wish all of you the best.

33:25.703 --> 33:27.112
Owen, wait.

33:30.562 --> 33:31.904
I don't want you to go.

33:32.117 --> 33:33.969
This is... oh, God...

33:34.234 --> 33:36.578
an incredibly difficult decision,

33:36.809 --> 33:42.267
but I know that I admire
and respect you so much,

33:42.454 --> 33:44.449
and I don't want us to end with this.

33:44.526 --> 33:46.421
- Serena.
- No. I...

33:46.991 --> 33:50.322
I wish tonight hadn't gone
the way that it did,

33:50.399 --> 33:52.420
but I know that the emotions

33:52.497 --> 33:54.426
behind these issues are complicated,

33:54.503 --> 33:56.757
and honestly,
being from a military family,

33:56.834 --> 33:58.430
what you said, it made sense to me.

33:58.507 --> 34:01.367
Serena, look what he did, okay?

34:01.796 --> 34:03.500
I'm only saying this to protect you.

34:03.577 --> 34:06.398
The guy, he's clearly damaged.

34:06.501 --> 34:08.023
Yeah.

34:08.577 --> 34:12.109
I'm... I'm damaged, too.

34:12.571 --> 34:14.248
I mean...

34:15.952 --> 34:17.627
we're human.

34:18.851 --> 34:20.708
Oh, August, I am so sorry,

34:20.857 --> 34:22.686
but I have to say goodbye
to you tonight.

34:22.763 --> 34:25.150
- Serena, don't.
- I think you are wonderful,

34:25.228 --> 34:28.538
but, uh, I realized tonight that
you do... you live in a bubble,

34:28.606 --> 34:30.998
a world of what should be
instead of what is,

34:31.065 --> 34:33.978
and I-I need a partner
who sees it that way, too.

34:36.764 --> 34:38.070
Okay.

34:47.670 --> 34:49.085
Let me guess.

34:49.440 --> 34:52.764
Quinn asked you to produce
some big moment for the show,

34:52.862 --> 34:53.984
and you did it.

34:54.061 --> 34:55.398
Yeah, something like that.

34:55.538 --> 34:57.557
So what happened
to that great relationship

34:57.634 --> 34:59.585
with Serena you were so proud of?

34:59.906 --> 35:02.124
- It is great.
- Really?

35:02.492 --> 35:04.931
So, were you thinking
about what was best for her

35:04.999 --> 35:07.499
when you were blowing stuff up
for Quinn, or...

35:07.704 --> 35:10.193
Yeah, well, hey.

35:10.718 --> 35:13.413
At least you got
what you wanted out of it.

35:14.554 --> 35:15.991
What does that mean?

35:16.171 --> 35:17.674
I didn't want anything.

35:17.742 --> 35:19.508
Oh, come on, Rachel.

35:19.773 --> 35:21.118
You must get something

35:21.187 --> 35:23.382
out of these things you do for Quinn.

35:23.507 --> 35:26.624
You're willing to sacrifice
every relationship you have.

35:26.788 --> 35:28.072
So, what is it?

35:28.140 --> 35:30.556
Maybe some of that love you
never got from your real mother?

35:30.624 --> 35:32.499
You learn that in Psych 101?

35:32.765 --> 35:34.249
You can deny it all you want,

35:34.359 --> 35:36.161
but what Quinn
is asking you to do, Rachel,

35:36.238 --> 35:39.277
that is not what love looks like.

35:43.085 --> 35:44.870
Look, it's not Quinn.
It's not her fault.

35:45.063 --> 35:47.203
You're right. This is up to you.

35:47.929 --> 35:50.205
You already broke off
one dysfunctional relationship

35:50.273 --> 35:52.312
when you cut ties with your mother.

35:52.742 --> 35:54.703
Now you have a decision to make.

35:55.156 --> 36:00.298
Can you do it again...
with Quinn?

36:02.781 --> 36:03.972
Hey.

36:04.120 --> 36:06.609
Well, finally took Crystal home,

36:06.677 --> 36:10.210
convinced her the evening
was a smashing success.

36:10.320 --> 36:13.000
Hey, that was incredible, the way
you turned the whole thing around.

36:13.109 --> 36:16.320
Mm-hmm, yeah. Incredible.

36:17.117 --> 36:19.312
I still have a noose around my neck.

36:19.951 --> 36:22.080
I just get to spend some time
hanging around

36:22.148 --> 36:24.049
till someone kicks the bucket
out from under me.

36:24.117 --> 36:26.657
We'll figure it out, huh? We'll fix it.

36:27.830 --> 36:29.158
As long as we're together,

36:29.226 --> 36:31.585
there's nothing we can't face,
kiddo.

36:34.015 --> 36:35.849
Tomorrow,

36:36.085 --> 36:37.654
I'm gonna break up with Crystal, and...

36:37.731 --> 36:39.328
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

36:40.656 --> 36:42.156
Why would you do that?

36:42.351 --> 36:43.742
Why would you break up with her?

36:43.819 --> 36:46.532
So you and I can be together for real.

36:47.604 --> 36:49.572
Well, don't.

36:49.640 --> 36:51.064
I don't want that.

36:51.343 --> 36:53.803
I don't want to go down that road again.

36:53.880 --> 36:58.804
Listen, Chet, I mean, you saw my house.

36:58.999 --> 37:01.111
That's my plan for the future,

37:01.367 --> 37:04.445
if I even still have one at this point.

37:09.710 --> 37:12.898
I am sorry if I gave you
the wrong impression.

37:13.936 --> 37:17.129
Listen, I, um...
I need to make some calls

37:17.199 --> 37:19.441
to figure out what my strategy is, here.

37:21.015 --> 37:24.280
Uh... yeah, I mean...

37:46.259 --> 37:48.338
I thought
that was really great today.

37:48.406 --> 37:50.425
Got all those flags up.
I thought they looked awesome.

37:50.492 --> 37:52.635
You backstabbing little rodent.

37:52.703 --> 37:54.616
- What?
- You're fired.

37:56.242 --> 37:57.330
Why?

37:57.398 --> 37:58.863
You wiped my computer clean.

37:58.940 --> 38:01.320
You knew where to look,
and you knew what was at stake.

38:01.533 --> 38:03.017
Quinn, I didn't do that. I...

38:03.085 --> 38:05.767
You know, I was willing
to give you a million chances...

38:05.835 --> 38:07.688
- I really didn't.
- To help you grow that thick skin

38:07.755 --> 38:09.460
that you need in this business...

38:09.601 --> 38:11.734
- Quinn.
- Because we are a family,

38:12.179 --> 38:15.374
a dysfunctional insane asylum,
yes, but a family.

38:15.492 --> 38:17.339
I don't know who did that,
Quinn, but it wasn't me.

38:17.406 --> 38:20.390
I don't keep traitors in my family...

38:21.773 --> 38:23.156
so you are cut out.

38:23.523 --> 38:25.445
Excommunicated.

38:26.601 --> 38:29.546
Maybe Gary can help you,
but I don't really are.

38:30.515 --> 38:32.890
Just don't ever come back.

39:00.174 --> 39:01.465
Nice work.

39:01.835 --> 39:03.630
Quinn never saw it coming.

39:03.929 --> 39:05.374
So, the job is mine?

39:06.367 --> 39:07.921
You deliver, I deliver.

39:08.093 --> 39:11.202
Got to say, I wasn't sure you'd
go against your pal like this.

39:12.421 --> 39:14.515
Huh. Quinn's a big girl.

39:15.143 --> 39:17.515
It's not personal. It's business.

39:23.710 --> 39:25.546
All right. Let's go.

39:48.495 --> 39:49.867
Hey.

39:57.328 --> 39:59.438
I can't believe I fell for it again.

40:01.300 --> 40:06.188
You produced me,
the whole thing...

40:06.838 --> 40:08.229
the last-minute interview,

40:08.297 --> 40:10.571
running out of time to talk to Owen.

40:13.852 --> 40:18.556
That fight was your end game,
and I fell for it again.

40:19.813 --> 40:21.774
You used me again.

40:25.321 --> 40:28.823
- Jeremy...
- I killed two people, Rachel,

40:30.719 --> 40:33.482
for you, 'cause I thought
that I-I loved you.

40:33.922 --> 40:36.086
Like somehow that made it sane.

40:38.594 --> 40:40.602
You made me a murderer.

40:42.578 --> 40:44.149
I know.

40:46.735 --> 40:48.977
I did that to you. I'm sorry.

40:53.321 --> 40:55.203
I'm so sorry.
