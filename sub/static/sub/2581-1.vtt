(MURRAY) You know, my
grandfather started the shop,

01:38.200 --> 01:43.930
my father had it, and
now I have to close it.

01:51.320 --> 01:54.159
This is the end of
an era, my friend.

01:54.160 --> 01:55.679
Let me tell you.

01:55.680 --> 01:57.319
Nowadays, only...

01:57.320 --> 02:00.679
rare people buy rare books.

02:00.680 --> 02:02.639
You'll get back on your feet.

02:02.640 --> 02:05.159
Hey, I have a very funny
story to tell you.

02:05.160 --> 02:08.199
- Mm-hmm.
- Today I was at my dermatologist's

02:08.199 --> 02:10.839
for a little procedure,
nothing serious.

02:10.840 --> 02:12.959
You know, I'm talking
to her for a while.

02:12.960 --> 02:15.399
- Mm-hmm.
- She tells me she was with her girlfriend,

02:15.400 --> 02:17.519
and they... they were
discussing things.

02:17.520 --> 02:18.999
And they came to the conclusion

02:19.000 --> 02:22.719
that they both wanted
to have a ménage.

02:22.720 --> 02:24.719
This is what she tells me.

02:24.720 --> 02:26.839
And I... I'm flabbergasted.

02:26.840 --> 02:28.199
I say, "A ménage a trois?"

02:28.200 --> 02:30.239
And she said, "Yeah."
This is what she wants.

02:30.240 --> 02:32.559
- This came out of nowhere.
- Out of nowhere.

02:32.560 --> 02:35.639
The... apparently, she
and her girlfriend

02:35.640 --> 02:39.239
want to experience, you
know, a threesome.

02:39.240 --> 02:42.279
And... and she asked
me, do I know anybody?

02:42.280 --> 02:45.159
And I... I said... I said, "Yeah.

02:45.160 --> 02:46.919
"I know somebody,
but it'll cost you

02:46.920 --> 02:48.399
a thousand bucks."

02:48.400 --> 02:52.119
And... And you know, the truth is,

02:52.120 --> 02:55.599
I was thinking of you.

02:55.600 --> 02:57.439
- Me?
- Why not?

02:57.440 --> 02:59.759
You... You were always
great with women.

02:59.760 --> 03:01.439
And, you know, she's attractive.

03:01.440 --> 03:03.039
She's round and curvaceous...

03:03.040 --> 03:06.079
I saw a photograph of
her friend in a thong.

03:06.080 --> 03:08.999
And her friend is a
crippler, and she's...

03:09.000 --> 03:10.679
Are you on drugs?

03:10.680 --> 03:12.759
Apart from my Zoloft, no.

03:12.760 --> 03:16.159
Well, why would I ever
entertain something like that?

03:16.160 --> 03:17.559
How many... How many days

03:17.560 --> 03:19.119
you working now at the flower shop?

03:19.120 --> 03:20.639
- Two.
- Two, okay, so you're living

03:20.640 --> 03:22.399
hand to mouth. Jesus.

03:22.400 --> 03:25.279
Who bailed you out when you couldn't
make the rent money last month?

03:25.280 --> 03:26.599
Yeah, but I paid you back.

03:26.600 --> 03:29.039
Yes, you paid me back, but
basically you're out of work.

03:29.040 --> 03:30.279
And you're closing shop.

03:30.280 --> 03:31.679
And I'm closing shop.
Exactly.

03:31.680 --> 03:33.079
Of course, I would, you know,

03:33.080 --> 03:34.639
get a little taste of this.

03:34.640 --> 03:36.759
I mean, I... I saw myself

03:36.760 --> 03:39.479
getting a small fee.

03:39.480 --> 03:41.719
How long do you know me?

03:41.720 --> 03:43.519
Long? I've known you
since you were a kid,

03:43.520 --> 03:46.371
since you broke into this
bookstore and tried to rob it.

04:58.640 --> 05:01.359
Papa Mo, I'm sorry
you lost your job.

05:01.360 --> 05:04.519
Your mother still has her
job, so thank God for that.

05:04.520 --> 05:06.679
Papa Mo, what does this word mean?

05:06.680 --> 05:09.999
E-n-s-o-r-c-e-l-l-e-d.

05:10.000 --> 05:12.079
"Ensorcelled" is, you know,

05:12.080 --> 05:13.759
like "enchanted," like when a...

05:13.760 --> 05:16.159
a sorceress casts a spell on you.

05:16.160 --> 05:17.919
Don't you go getting
yourself enchanted

05:17.920 --> 05:19.159
while mama's away at work.

05:19.160 --> 05:21.119
This is how she talks
to the man who put her

05:21.120 --> 05:22.639
through bartender school.

05:22.640 --> 05:25.399
- Mm-hmm.
- There's lice in my class, Papa Mo.

05:25.400 --> 05:27.719
- I think I got lice.
- Lice?

05:27.720 --> 05:29.519
My hair itches.

05:29.520 --> 05:31.599
- Oh my God.

Nothing in the house.
Don't touch a thing.

05:40.400 --> 05:42.159
It's Dr. Parker.

05:42.160 --> 05:44.199
Dr. Parker, is something wrong?

05:44.200 --> 05:46.919
Were you serious?
Knowing someone?

05:46.920 --> 05:48.799
Oh. Oh.

05:48.800 --> 05:50.599
My husband's got a lot
of money, Murray,

05:50.600 --> 05:52.399
- and I'd like to...
- Hang on a second.

05:52.400 --> 05:56.719
Excuse me. Let me take
this in my office.

05:56.720 --> 05:58.599
Maybe I should try
your guy out first.

05:58.600 --> 06:00.919
Alone. Just me and him.

06:00.920 --> 06:03.239
You know, kind of like
an out-of-town tryout.

06:03.240 --> 06:05.079
Exactly, like a sneak preview.

06:05.080 --> 06:06.959
Yeah. Is he clean?

06:06.960 --> 06:08.799
Yes, of course he's clean.

06:08.800 --> 06:10.519
I mean, I don't want to get AIDS.

06:10.520 --> 06:12.279
- AIDS?
- Or gonorrhea.

06:12.280 --> 06:14.439
Gonorrhea? Jesus, what
are you talking about?

06:14.440 --> 06:17.039
He's a nice kid.
I know him personally.

06:17.040 --> 06:19.439
- And he would tell you?
- Yes, he would.

06:19.440 --> 06:22.279
You know, as far as I know.

06:22.280 --> 06:23.839
And he's got protection?

06:23.840 --> 06:26.159
Sure, he's got protection.
The guy's a pro.

06:26.160 --> 06:31.439
I'm a little crazed.
I just came from an AIDS benefit.

06:31.440 --> 06:33.399
So...

06:33.400 --> 06:36.079
- We're really going to do this?
- We're definitely going to do it.

06:36.080 --> 06:37.559
I mean, I'm not going to be there.

06:37.560 --> 06:40.279
- Okay.
- You know, I just have to,

06:40.280 --> 06:42.279
you know, check out
his availability,

06:42.280 --> 06:45.879
because, you know,
he's highly in demand.

06:45.880 --> 06:48.287
Lover boy. What are you
doing in that closet?

06:50.000 --> 06:51.439
Checking for lice.

06:51.440 --> 06:55.008
- He's always checking for something.
- Oh my god.

07:09.320 --> 07:10.919
You need a young,

07:10.920 --> 07:13.639

07:13.640 --> 07:15.479
This is exactly my point.

07:15.480 --> 07:17.559
I am not a beautiful man.

07:17.560 --> 07:20.439
Did I say you were beautiful?
But you have a different quality.

07:20.440 --> 07:22.519
You have a certain
kind of sex appeal.

07:22.520 --> 07:24.919
- Thank you.
- Is Mick Jagger a beautiful man?

07:24.920 --> 07:28.359

It's a horror.

07:28.360 --> 07:31.199
But he's hot. Mick is hot.
And that's what you have.

07:31.200 --> 07:32.679
Let me ask you a question.

07:32.680 --> 07:34.519
You look good without
your clothes, right?

07:34.520 --> 07:36.479
How do you know?

07:36.480 --> 07:39.359
Because some guys just look
better when they're naked.

07:39.360 --> 07:41.039
I figured you're one.

07:41.040 --> 07:42.959

do with Mick Jagger?

07:42.960 --> 07:44.839
He's rich and he's famous.

07:44.840 --> 07:46.399
Yes, but you're sexy.

07:46.400 --> 07:48.839
- Says who?
- Says me.

08:03.720 --> 08:05.519
you're not afraid to get dirty.

08:05.520 --> 08:07.839
You get your hands dirty.
You're working with plants.

wires and plumbing

08:11.000 --> 08:13.919

bowls, you know.

08:13.920 --> 08:15.879

You're not afraid...

in a very positive way.

somebody happy here.

Would I steer you wrong?

Okay. Now, now we
can discuss things.

08:54.720 --> 08:56.039
I didn't say I was interested.

08:56.040 --> 08:57.399
I want to know, what would it be?

08:57.400 --> 09:00.599
Well, you know, an agent
gets 10% usually.

09:00.600 --> 09:02.599
A manager will take 15%.

09:02.600 --> 09:04.919
The guys in the art
galleries get 50%.

09:04.920 --> 09:07.599
- They split 50-50.
- Mm-hmm.

09:07.600 --> 09:09.759

13:19.880 --> 13:23.519
These are for you.

13:23.520 --> 13:26.319
How sweet. What is that?

13:26.320 --> 13:29.159
The arrangement?
It's Japanese.

13:29.160 --> 13:30.839
My friend, Niho,

13:30.840 --> 13:33.042
told me how to make it.

13:36.480 --> 13:39.729
Please come in.
Make yourself at home.

13:43.360 --> 13:46.370
Thank you.

13:51.760 --> 13:54.559
- So...
- It's a beautiful day.

13:54.560 --> 13:56.159
Yes.

13:56.160 --> 13:58.199
Shame to be inside.

13:58.200 --> 14:00.039
We have a balcony.

14:00.040 --> 14:02.199
Nice.

14:02.200 --> 14:04.879
- So you're a doctor.
- Dermatologist.

14:04.880 --> 14:08.439
- You have good skin.
- My mother had good skin.

14:08.440 --> 14:11.039
Even in her 80s, barely a wrinkle.

14:11.040 --> 14:12.759
You couldn't tell her age.

14:12.760 --> 14:14.119
You were close?

14:14.120 --> 14:15.839
Mm-hmm.

14:15.840 --> 14:17.610
That's unusual.

14:22.680 --> 14:24.450
I've never done this before.

14:27.800 --> 14:29.439
- First time.
- Yes.

14:29.440 --> 14:30.799
- Mm-hmm.
- Well...

14:30.800 --> 14:33.559
- I understand.
- Yeah.

14:33.560 --> 14:36.599
- You do this often.
- No. I mean...

14:36.600 --> 14:38.919
So this is kind of
a part-time thing.

14:38.920 --> 14:42.010
Yes, you could say that.

14:48.600 --> 14:50.239
I... I think I should...

14:50.240 --> 14:52.319
- Let me get you... you want this?
- Yeah.

14:52.320 --> 14:54.602
- Same, yeah.
- Mm-hmm.

14:56.480 --> 14:58.682
Watch.

15:02.600 --> 15:04.439
I'm married.
Did you know that?

15:04.440 --> 15:07.599
Uh-huh.
Is that your husband?

15:07.600 --> 15:10.079
Claude.
He's a mountain climber.

15:10.080 --> 15:13.039
Huh. A good-looking man.

15:13.040 --> 15:14.526
Yes.

15:16.080 --> 15:18.279
Do you like the music?
I could change it.

15:18.280 --> 15:20.119
No, it's perfect.

15:20.120 --> 15:23.005
- It's instrumental.
- Ah, that's better.

15:28.560 --> 15:30.319
Do you want me to
take my clothes off?

15:30.320 --> 15:32.439
No, no, not yet.

15:32.440 --> 15:36.439
Okay, just... maybe after.

15:36.440 --> 15:39.599
This is so...

15:39.600 --> 15:41.802
high school.

16:04.160 --> 16:06.727
Oh, I, I, I...

16:08.800 --> 16:11.606
- Oh, I...
- (MOANS)

16:16.840 --> 16:19.679
I didn't go all the
way in high school.

16:19.680 --> 16:23.639
It's slow. It's fine.

16:23.640 --> 16:25.683
Relax.

16:43.240 --> 16:46.559
Mortality is a very iffy thing.

16:46.560 --> 16:49.759
I mean, you're here one day,
and then something happens,

16:49.760 --> 16:52.239
and the next day you're gone.

16:52.240 --> 16:55.762
And the world goes on without you.

17:03.400 --> 17:05.329
It's a...

17:08.520 --> 17:11.239
You know...

17:11.240 --> 17:15.039
actually...

17:15.040 --> 17:19.398
when something terrible happens,

17:19.400 --> 17:21.039
you know, like a...

17:21.040 --> 17:22.598
an earthquake, maybe,

17:22.599 --> 17:27.799
or... a pogrom,

17:27.800 --> 17:29.479
I think it's not

17:29.480 --> 17:33.079
a bad idea sometimes

17:33.080 --> 17:35.799
for a person to reach out.

17:35.800 --> 17:39.279
- To a rabbi?
- Sure, a rabbi's good.

17:39.280 --> 17:41.439
A rabbi's good.

17:41.440 --> 17:43.399
But...

17:43.400 --> 17:45.959
I think it's very nice sometimes

17:45.960 --> 17:49.319
to reach out beyond the rabbi.

17:49.320 --> 17:52.599
I mean, something more.

17:52.600 --> 17:55.167
Venture further out.

17:58.480 --> 18:01.001
(DR. PARKER MOANS)

18:01.600 --> 18:05.279
I don't care.

18:05.280 --> 18:08.679
Fuck you.

18:08.680 --> 18:13.999
Fuck you, Claude!

18:14.000 --> 18:16.362
(DR. PARKER MOANS)

18:24.600 --> 18:28.439
So how long were you
up there? Two hours?

18:28.440 --> 18:30.279
Right. Around.

18:30.280 --> 18:32.119
But I'm not sure I understand you.

18:32.120 --> 18:34.839
Are we charging, you
know, by the hour?

18:34.840 --> 18:36.319
What, you're asking me?

18:36.320 --> 18:38.839
No. What I assumed,
naturally, was that it was,

18:38.840 --> 18:40.879
you know, we be charging per...

18:40.880 --> 18:42.039
you know, per shot.

18:42.040 --> 18:43.719
How many times did
you do it with her?

18:43.720 --> 18:45.599
- More than once?
- Mm-hmm.

18:45.600 --> 18:48.319
Really? I'm very impressed.

18:48.320 --> 18:49.159
Viagra?

18:49.160 --> 18:51.169
Oh, no.

18:52.800 --> 18:53.999
I... I don't believe this.

18:54.000 --> 18:55.679
You don't even open the envelope.

18:55.680 --> 18:58.159
- Hey, she's your doctor.
- Yeah, she's my doctor,

18:58.160 --> 18:59.959
but you know, in today's world,

18:59.960 --> 19:02.879
she could turn out to be a
psychopathic ax murderer.

19:02.880 --> 19:05.639
Well, thanks for telling me.

19:05.640 --> 19:07.319
Wait one second. I'm counting.

19:07.320 --> 19:08.559
I... I don't understand this.

19:08.560 --> 19:11.199
Where'd you get the
extra 500 bucks?

19:11.200 --> 19:13.079
- Tip.
- A tip?

19:13.080 --> 19:14.999
- She tipped you?
- Yeah.

19:15.000 --> 19:16.679
She must've really liked you.

19:16.680 --> 19:19.039
- Mm-hmm.
- Wow.

19:19.040 --> 19:20.719
You know, I hate to bring this

19:20.720 --> 19:23.519
to your attention, but
the general protocol,

19:23.520 --> 19:26.999
certainly among waitresses
is they'll pool their tips,

19:27.000 --> 19:29.601
and they split them.

19:31.440 --> 19:33.879
- Take two.
- Two.

19:33.880 --> 19:37.439
Perfect. I think that's
appropriate division.

19:37.440 --> 19:40.759
1,500 for you and 1,000 for me.

19:40.760 --> 19:44.039
Very nice day's work,
let me tell you.

19:44.040 --> 19:45.519
I... this, you know,

19:45.520 --> 19:47.359
This makes it official.

19:47.360 --> 19:48.719
I'm your ho.

19:48.720 --> 19:52.242
Hey, it's the oldest profession.

20:18.640 --> 20:20.490
Thanks, honey.

20:38.400 --> 20:40.279
You know, I picked out
the fabric myself.

20:40.280 --> 20:41.599
Oh, that's beautiful.

20:41.600 --> 20:44.839
I think I was high
on acid at the time.

20:44.840 --> 20:47.239
Oh, feel it. It's great.

20:47.240 --> 20:49.439
Yeah, yeah, it's...

20:49.440 --> 20:53.326
Yeah, it's stuffed with
turkey feathers or something.

21:20.880 --> 21:24.279
(BOYS SCREAM)

21:24.280 --> 21:25.519
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

21:25.520 --> 21:27.643
Wait, calm yourselves.

21:32.840 --> 21:35.999
Oh, a gigolo?
It's in the music business.

21:36.000 --> 21:38.399
They, you know, there's
the music and lyrics...

21:38.400 --> 21:40.409
- Oh yeah.
- And the gigolo parts.

21:48.240 --> 21:50.159
It's me, Fior.
Is Murray home yet?

21:50.160 --> 21:52.479
I can't get through to him.
He hasn't been picking up.

21:52.480 --> 21:55.639
No, no no no.
There's no problem.

21:55.640 --> 21:57.479
All right, just tell
him that I called.

21:57.480 --> 21:59.919
Thanks. Bye.

21:59.920 --> 22:02.079
Waiting for someone?

22:02.080 --> 22:03.399
No.

22:03.400 --> 22:05.079
Would you like some company?

22:05.080 --> 22:06.839
- For how long?
- An hour or two.

22:06.840 --> 22:10.679
Whatever you like.

22:10.680 --> 22:14.679
Le professione del
vechio del mondo.

22:14.680 --> 22:17.247
I don't understand.

22:20.240 --> 22:22.966
I think you do.

22:31.440 --> 22:33.199
Shimshon. How are you?

22:33.200 --> 22:35.359
Good. You going to
play baseball, Dovi?

22:35.360 --> 22:38.719
Yeah.

22:38.720 --> 22:40.599
Go, Twisters.

22:40.600 --> 22:42.079
Tell your mother I said hi.

22:42.080 --> 22:44.282
Okay, I will.

23:07.280 --> 23:10.439
Short men always pursued me.

23:10.440 --> 23:13.439
My brothers, who are really
tall, would get so upset.

23:13.440 --> 23:15.879
"Why can't you find a tall man?"

23:15.880 --> 23:18.999
Like it's easy.

23:19.000 --> 23:20.119
Good skin?

23:20.120 --> 23:23.399
Soft. Silky.

23:23.400 --> 23:24.839
Sense of humor?

23:24.840 --> 23:27.799
Well...

23:27.800 --> 23:29.919
Too much honey, get away from me.

23:29.920 --> 23:32.639
A man needs to be funny, no?

23:32.640 --> 23:34.399
A man needs to be a
man, not a woman.

23:34.400 --> 23:35.799
Not a pretty boy.

23:35.800 --> 23:37.239
Perfect.

23:37.240 --> 23:38.799
A beautiful son of a bitch,

23:38.800 --> 23:40.759
He tells you that he loves you,

23:40.760 --> 23:43.279
but he's really thinking
something else.

23:43.280 --> 23:46.079
I don't think we got that far.

23:46.080 --> 23:48.679
So, if this...

23:48.680 --> 23:51.479
does he have a name?

23:51.480 --> 23:53.079
Fioravante.

23:53.080 --> 23:55.599
I like it. Sexy.

23:55.600 --> 23:57.599
Mm-hmm.

23:57.600 --> 23:59.639
So...

23:59.640 --> 24:02.439
If this Fioravante...

24:02.440 --> 24:05.319
was an ice cream cone,

24:05.320 --> 24:10.319
what flavor would you
say that he was?

24:10.320 --> 24:11.999
Pistachio.

24:12.000 --> 24:14.679
Perfect.

24:14.680 --> 24:16.679
Yeah.

24:16.680 --> 24:20.519
Maybe I should try him, hmm?

24:20.520 --> 24:23.159
No? Why not?

24:23.160 --> 24:25.886
Hmm?

24:27.160 --> 24:30.762
Pistachio.

24:39.720 --> 24:42.239
Hey, we're in demand.

24:42.240 --> 24:43.999
Why don't you just announce it?

24:44.000 --> 24:46.079
Yeah, that's a pretty
nice-looking lady.

24:46.080 --> 24:47.839
We got another customer.
Maybe more.

24:47.840 --> 24:49.199
- Really. How?
- Yeah, how?

24:49.200 --> 24:51.199
Word of mouth.
Hi, God bless you, girls.

24:51.200 --> 24:53.959
Keep... she likes tall guys.

24:53.960 --> 24:55.479
You know, I mean,
you got to see her.

24:55.480 --> 24:58.119
You're not going to believe it.
You can't be blasé about this.

24:58.120 --> 24:59.439
She is...

24:59.440 --> 25:01.159
well-constructed, anatomically.

25:01.160 --> 25:03.879
I mean, I'm talking about,
like, a miracle of physics.

25:03.880 --> 25:05.279
I don't know what keeps her up.

25:05.280 --> 25:06.679
Is this Dr. Parker's friend?

25:06.680 --> 25:08.519
Dr. Parker's wealthy friend.

25:08.520 --> 25:10.199
Shh!

25:10.200 --> 25:12.159
Dr. Parker's rich friend.
Do me a favor.

25:12.160 --> 25:13.919
Think of it as a performance.

25:13.920 --> 25:14.919
- Uh-huh.
- You know?

25:14.920 --> 25:18.119
Because that's what they want.
They want you to play act anyhow.

25:18.120 --> 25:19.879
And the billing?

25:19.880 --> 25:21.719
Above the titling.

25:21.720 --> 25:23.559
I'm going to give you
a prepared envelope,

25:23.560 --> 25:24.839
and we'll put something in it.

25:24.840 --> 25:27.199
And then if they give you
a gratuity or something,

25:27.200 --> 25:30.359
I'll give you a second
envelope for that.

25:30.360 --> 25:33.239
I know what you're thinking,
but it seems right to charge.

25:33.240 --> 25:34.559
It doesn't always feel right.

25:34.560 --> 25:37.399
Yeah, only because you
never did it before.

25:37.400 --> 25:39.919
It's like anything else.
A butcher, first day on the job,

25:39.920 --> 25:42.879
he's got to cut up a cow.
There's blood, there's bones.

25:42.880 --> 25:45.479
You know, so it's got to be awful.

25:45.480 --> 25:47.879
But he becomes
eventually a butcher.

25:47.880 --> 25:49.279
These are vulnerable people.

25:49.280 --> 25:51.799
Well, what, do you feel guilty?

25:51.800 --> 25:52.719
A bit.

25:52.720 --> 25:56.119
- Well, that's okay.
- I don't have a problem with the money.

25:56.120 --> 25:57.879
- It's just...
- Yeah, I know. I know.

25:57.880 --> 25:59.559
It's the morality.
I understand.

25:59.560 --> 26:02.879
Because it's a commercial venture.
But... But don't think of it that way.

26:02.880 --> 26:04.799
Think of it that you're
boosting the ego.

26:04.800 --> 26:07.639
You're helping their self-esteem.

26:07.640 --> 26:08.959
Yeah, maybe that dilutes it.

26:08.960 --> 26:10.279
Yes, that's what I'm saying.

26:10.280 --> 26:11.959
It dilutes it, because...

26:11.960 --> 26:14.279
take a bartender.
I hate bartenders.

26:14.280 --> 26:16.919
Do you know why?
Because they thrive

26:16.920 --> 26:19.759
on other people's misery.

26:19.760 --> 26:22.319
But... but I can't cast aspersions.

26:22.320 --> 26:23.999
You got to make a
living in this life.

26:24.000 --> 26:26.639
Come on, let's have a drink.
You look depressed.

26:26.640 --> 26:29.919
- Okay.
- Okay. Here, this is Grey Goose.

26:29.920 --> 26:34.479
It does not leave a
trace on your breath.

26:34.480 --> 26:37.331
- L'chaim.
- Okay.

26:40.080 --> 26:41.959
I love it. I love it. Smooth.

26:41.960 --> 26:43.959
- Smooth. Mm-hmm.
- So.

26:43.960 --> 26:46.159
Can I tell you what
I've been thinking?

26:46.160 --> 26:48.799
- Mm-hmm.
- I'm thinking that you need a name.

26:48.800 --> 26:50.199
Yeah, like what kind of name?

26:50.200 --> 26:51.959
You need a name because
you're a brand.

26:51.960 --> 26:53.879
You're a product now.
You know. A stud's name.

26:53.880 --> 26:55.999
Like Spanish Jack

exactly what you do.

We should put that on a marquee.

27:12.840 --> 27:15.519
- What about your name?
- Why do I need a name?

27:15.520 --> 27:18.519
Hey. If you're a pimp,
you got to have a name.

27:18.520 --> 27:20.119
I don't think of myself as a pimp.

27:20.120 --> 27:22.199
That's what you are.

27:22.200 --> 27:24.999
Technically I'm a pimp.
Because...

27:25.000 --> 27:26.559
I always leave that part out.

27:26.560 --> 27:29.199
What about "Bookmaster Mo?"

27:29.200 --> 27:31.159
- You like that?
- "Iceberg."

27:31.160 --> 27:33.479
iceberg's good. I like Iceberg.

What about "Dan Bongo?"

27:36.400 --> 27:39.079
I like that. I'll be "Dan Bongo."

It's nice to meet you, Dan.

If I did, I wouldn't be here.

We're all flesh and blood.

32:02.280 --> 32:06.159
You know, I'm reminded of the
story of Simon Ben Lakish,

32:06.160 --> 32:08.999
the great Jewish gladiator,

32:09.000 --> 32:11.079
who came upon Rabbi Yochman

32:11.080 --> 32:12.759
bathing in the Jordan

32:12.760 --> 32:15.279
and became so excited

32:15.280 --> 32:16.959
he ran, he pounced on him.

32:16.960 --> 32:19.279
I mean, he was all over
him, like a Greek.

32:19.280 --> 32:22.159
Yes, but the rabbi offered
him his sister instead,

32:22.160 --> 32:25.159
who was more beautiful
than Yochman himself.

32:25.160 --> 32:30.959
Yes, but my point is that
everybody needs contact.

32:30.960 --> 32:32.959
They need love.
They need affection.

32:32.960 --> 32:34.639

pull the shade up.

a psychiatrist?

32:50.480 --> 32:52.319
Psychiatrist, psychologist.

32:52.320 --> 32:55.359
Uh, podiatrist. You know.

45:19.120 --> 45:20.845
Vanilla!

45:22.080 --> 45:23.759
(DOVI) So...

45:23.760 --> 45:26.850
Denny tells me you're
a good plumber.

45:28.320 --> 45:31.479
Yeah, I do a little.

45:31.480 --> 45:34.319
That's good. I got a job.

45:34.320 --> 45:38.079
I could maybe use someone
who could do a little...

45:38.080 --> 45:39.719
plumbing.

45:39.720 --> 45:42.119
You got a card?

45:42.120 --> 45:44.527
No.

45:48.440 --> 45:50.881
Write.

45:59.120 --> 46:02.642
Thanks. I'll be in touch.

46:28.520 --> 46:30.119
Hey, there.

46:30.120 --> 46:31.479
Hey.

46:31.480 --> 46:34.319
The world's a mysterious place.

46:34.320 --> 46:36.839
Mm-hmm.

46:36.840 --> 46:38.279
You didn't see us over there?

46:38.280 --> 46:39.959
I was listening to the music.

46:39.960 --> 46:42.799
Mm-hmm.

46:42.800 --> 46:45.039
I'm with my husband.

46:45.040 --> 46:47.039
Claude?

46:47.040 --> 46:48.799
You remembered.

46:48.800 --> 46:51.039
Tell him I said hi.

46:51.040 --> 46:54.005
Oh, he's the jealous type.

46:56.240 --> 46:59.199
It's my birthday.

46:59.200 --> 47:01.767
Happy birthday.

47:47.800 --> 47:50.439
(PHONE RINGING)

47:50.440 --> 47:53.239
(WOMEN) The number you have
reached is not in service.

47:53.240 --> 47:55.239
Please check the
number and dial again.

47:55.240 --> 47:57.124
Thank you.

48:29.080 --> 48:31.319
- Avigal.
- Dovi.

48:31.320 --> 48:32.799
You look very nice.

48:32.800 --> 48:34.119
Thank you.

48:34.120 --> 48:36.239
- Where are you going?
- To the city.

48:36.240 --> 48:39.079
Ah. The city? What for?

48:39.080 --> 48:41.279
Doctor's appointment.

48:41.280 --> 48:42.839
You need a lift? I...

48:42.840 --> 48:44.639
I can give you a
lift in the patrol.

48:44.640 --> 48:47.159
No thank you.
I'll take the train.

48:47.160 --> 48:48.959
It's okay. I'll read my book.

48:48.960 --> 48:51.639
You know, every time
I speak with you,

48:51.640 --> 48:54.319
it feels like you're
always in a rush.

48:54.320 --> 48:55.759
Maybe it's a coincidence.

48:55.760 --> 48:57.519
Could be.

48:57.520 --> 48:59.919
Makes me think you don't like me.

48:59.920 --> 49:02.799
No, it's not that, it's just...

49:02.800 --> 49:05.519
A widow needs time.

49:05.520 --> 49:08.839
Time for what?

49:08.840 --> 49:10.879
Time.

49:10.880 --> 49:12.999
I'm sorry, it's just...

49:13.000 --> 49:15.279
it's been two years.

49:15.280 --> 49:16.679
I grew up right there, Avigal.

49:16.680 --> 49:18.479
Every day, I saw you.

49:18.480 --> 49:22.241
We never talked, but I saw you.

49:25.640 --> 49:29.519
I know I'm not from a Rebbish home,

49:29.520 --> 49:33.088
Avigal, but I'm...
I'm a good person.

49:34.840 --> 49:37.959
Not right now.

49:37.960 --> 49:39.879
If not now, when?

49:39.880 --> 49:42.519
I have to go, Dovi.
Sorry, I can't be late.

49:42.520 --> 49:44.210
See, you're always in a rush.

49:45.040 --> 49:47.879
Make sure you're home before dark.

49:47.880 --> 49:50.686
Why? It's not Shabbos.

51:25.160 --> 51:27.759
Did you attend yeshiva?

51:27.760 --> 51:29.439
Me?

51:29.440 --> 51:32.959
No. No.

51:32.960 --> 51:34.959
How long do you have?

51:34.960 --> 51:37.079
An hour.

51:37.080 --> 51:39.965
An hour and a half.

51:44.920 --> 51:49.799
You know, I didn't expect
to see you again so soon.

51:49.800 --> 51:53.359
I had a doctor's appointment.

51:53.360 --> 51:54.846
Oh.

52:00.360 --> 52:01.439
You like to read?

52:01.440 --> 52:02.641
Mm-hmm.

52:03.800 --> 52:05.279
Have you read that one?

52:05.280 --> 52:07.209
I'm not supposed to.

52:08.440 --> 52:10.483
But you did, right?

52:11.960 --> 52:15.359
I had to get rid of all my
books when I got married.

52:15.360 --> 52:19.451
Well, men have never
wanted women to read.

52:37.480 --> 52:40.159
Who's this? Your mother?

52:40.160 --> 52:41.879
Mm-hmm.

52:41.880 --> 52:44.479
She's pretty.

52:44.480 --> 52:46.079
What was she like?

52:46.080 --> 52:48.408
Like?

52:50.200 --> 52:52.759
She was just a woman

52:52.760 --> 52:56.646
who never got the breaks.

52:58.040 --> 52:59.730
Here we go.

53:00.400 --> 53:02.399
- Here, let me.
- I was going to...

53:02.400 --> 53:04.559
Debone it?
I don't mind.

53:04.560 --> 53:07.519
It's kosher.

53:07.520 --> 53:09.085
I'll get the...

53:19.880 --> 53:21.366
You show me how you do it.

53:24.240 --> 53:26.559
Hold down the fish with your fork.

53:26.560 --> 53:30.321
Take your spoon, no rough edges.

53:33.200 --> 53:34.759
Tease the spoon

53:34.760 --> 53:38.239
under the flesh, gently.

53:38.240 --> 53:41.279
Lifting the flesh away
from the skeleton

53:41.280 --> 53:44.563
until you have a whole filet.

53:48.920 --> 53:51.043
Then flip it over.

53:52.640 --> 53:56.686
Then grab the tail that is still
attached to the skeleton.

53:58.440 --> 54:02.690
And like a zipper, pull it off.

54:08.080 --> 54:09.999
What about the head?

54:10.000 --> 54:12.879
It's kosher.

54:12.880 --> 54:15.242
It reminds you to look forward.

54:16.040 --> 54:18.919
A real fish-eater eats the cheeks.

54:18.920 --> 54:20.690
They're the delicacy.

54:26.840 --> 54:29.479
Hmm?

54:29.480 --> 54:31.523
For me?

54:39.600 --> 54:42.644
Il boccone del re.

54:43.320 --> 54:45.170
That's "the king's bite."

54:48.160 --> 54:50.886
I knew you weren't a Virgil.

54:52.720 --> 54:55.639
Fioravante. What does that mean?

54:55.640 --> 54:56.919
Flower.

54:56.920 --> 55:00.599
What kind of flower?

55:00.600 --> 55:02.928
Rudbeckia maxima.

55:05.040 --> 55:07.039
That's a cabbage leaf coneflower.

55:07.040 --> 55:10.999
A big six-foot plant with
big blue-green leaves

55:11.000 --> 55:13.079
and bright yellow flowers.

55:13.080 --> 55:14.959
And a big schnoz?

55:14.960 --> 55:17.359
It's just a showpiece.

55:17.360 --> 55:19.608
It doesn't really work.

55:21.920 --> 55:24.039
When I was in...

55:24.040 --> 55:26.519
sixth grade,

55:26.520 --> 55:28.599
I used to sit next to this girl.

55:28.600 --> 55:30.439
She was Jewish.

55:30.440 --> 55:32.759
Good.

55:32.760 --> 55:36.599
She had beautiful thick brown hair.

55:36.600 --> 55:40.559
And I would only look
at her straight on

55:40.560 --> 55:43.491
because I had seen my nose
in a three-way mirror.

55:49.400 --> 55:50.679
You're a good cook.

55:50.680 --> 55:52.919
Thank you.

55:52.920 --> 55:55.919
For a man.

55:55.920 --> 55:58.199
Hmm.

55:58.200 --> 56:01.679
Do you have any family?

56:01.680 --> 56:04.121
Not anymore.

56:05.600 --> 56:09.119
And you're not lonely?

56:09.120 --> 56:11.129
You get used to it.

56:13.960 --> 56:16.083
So this is what you do?

56:18.280 --> 56:19.686
I guess so.

56:21.920 --> 56:24.885
You bring magic to the lonely.

56:29.840 --> 56:32.639
That's one way to put it.

56:32.640 --> 56:35.320
And you get paid for it.

56:36.960 --> 56:38.491
Sometimes.

56:43.280 --> 56:46.279
I don't have much time left.

56:46.280 --> 56:48.323
Festina lente.

56:51.400 --> 56:54.444
Hurry slowly, Avigal.

56:57.920 --> 57:00.726
I like when you say my name.

57:03.600 --> 57:05.848
Rudbeckia maxima.

57:07.600 --> 57:09.239
You're going down, Papa Mo.

57:09.240 --> 57:11.319
I'm killing you.
We should be playing for money.

57:11.320 --> 57:13.439
You're not going to
get me out, old man.

57:13.440 --> 57:15.399
- (COCO GROWLS)
- (MURRAY LAUGHS)

57:15.400 --> 57:16.879
Okay, you only missed it by a foot.

57:16.880 --> 57:19.239
Turn around. More, more, more.

57:19.240 --> 57:21.639
Okay, ready?

57:21.640 --> 57:22.759
Strike two.

57:22.760 --> 57:24.919
- You like baseball?
- Yeah.

57:24.920 --> 57:26.999
The Spanish guys teach me.

57:27.000 --> 57:30.599
Not like I'm so great or anything,
but you know, I could play a little.

57:30.600 --> 57:32.399
Last game, we lost 20 to 3.

57:32.400 --> 57:35.719
Would've been worse, but they
got this mercy rule thing.

57:35.720 --> 57:37.039
(GRUNTS)

57:37.040 --> 57:40.479
What do you think?
Money laundering?

57:40.480 --> 57:42.039
Organ traffic?

57:42.040 --> 57:43.719
What?

57:43.720 --> 57:45.251
Avigal?

57:46.560 --> 57:48.399
That she should be
involved in such a thing.

57:48.400 --> 57:50.999
Organ traffic, where
do you get that stuff?

57:51.000 --> 57:52.519
- I read it...
- Stop talking.

57:52.520 --> 57:53.679
(MURRAY) Okay, you guys.

57:53.680 --> 57:55.803
This is going to be my spitter.

57:56.520 --> 57:59.159
- Yeah!
- Way to go, Cefus!

57:59.160 --> 58:00.850
Aah!

58:02.360 --> 58:04.039
Shh. Listen to me.

58:04.040 --> 58:05.399
Haitian Day parade...

58:05.400 --> 58:07.359
five bottle rockets I
took right to the chest.

58:07.360 --> 58:09.319
Did I cry? Did I make a sound?

58:09.320 --> 58:11.879
Not a peep. I took it.
Like a Sabra, I took it.

58:11.880 --> 58:14.401
Don't forget your envelope.

58:19.240 --> 58:20.799
You know, it's like candy,

58:20.800 --> 58:24.039
Having sex with you.

58:24.040 --> 58:27.839
You have one piece, and
you always want another.

58:27.840 --> 58:30.559
Do you have a girlfriend?

58:30.560 --> 58:33.119
I bet you don't say much.

58:33.120 --> 58:36.039
Get them into bed.
Make them happy.

58:36.040 --> 58:38.319
And then what?

58:38.320 --> 58:42.239
The Portuguese have a word for it.

58:42.240 --> 58:43.839
"Saudade."

58:43.840 --> 58:47.761
Yeah. A longing for something
that doesn't exist.

58:50.160 --> 58:53.399
I'm ready.

58:53.400 --> 58:54.839
Let's do the ménage.

58:54.840 --> 58:56.959
Call Bongo.

58:56.960 --> 58:59.119
Bongo? Oh yeah.

58:59.120 --> 59:00.679
Murray.

59:00.680 --> 59:02.719
Dan Bongo.

59:02.720 --> 59:04.839
Have a piece of dark chocolate.

59:04.840 --> 59:06.485
It's good for you.

59:09.920 --> 59:13.599
You know, you're top shelf.

59:13.600 --> 59:15.479
Hard to reach.

59:15.480 --> 59:17.489
That's what makes you so good.

59:28.760 --> 59:31.239
- Hi.
- Hello.

59:31.240 --> 59:34.808
Gather round.
These are your kids?

59:38.080 --> 59:40.119
We're going to divide
up into two teams

59:40.120 --> 59:42.084
and play baseball, okay?

59:45.280 --> 59:47.279
What do you think?

59:47.280 --> 59:49.079
- (MUTTERING)
- We don't play baseball.

59:49.080 --> 59:51.159
We're very serious people.
We have to study.

59:51.160 --> 59:53.679
Dovi plays.
Go, Twisters.

59:53.680 --> 59:55.359
It's a waste of time.

59:55.360 --> 59:56.839
Sometimes wasting time

59:56.840 --> 59:59.319
is healthy for the body.
It's good.

59:59.320 --> 01:00:02.279
I don't understand the
concept of competition.

01:00:02.280 --> 01:00:04.959
He doesn't understand the concept.

01:00:04.960 --> 01:00:06.759
You're overanalyzing.

01:00:06.760 --> 01:00:08.759
- Blacks against whites.
- No, no.

01:00:08.760 --> 01:00:11.359
- (YELLING)
- That's not going to happen.

01:00:11.360 --> 01:00:12.999
Not a good idea.
That's amazing.

01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:15.879
This is why fascism gets
a toehold all the time.

01:00:15.880 --> 01:00:18.159
You be on his side.
I want to break this up.

01:00:18.160 --> 01:00:21.919
I want to get a little Rainbow
Coalition here, guys, okay?

01:00:21.920 --> 01:00:25.363
Which one of these chosen people
do you want to play with?

01:00:49.360 --> 01:00:53.479
I couldn't wait to see you again.

01:00:53.480 --> 01:00:56.319
Ever see what's his name play?
Kevin Youkilis?

01:00:56.320 --> 01:00:58.039
The Red Sox?
You know, he's got a...

01:00:58.040 --> 01:01:01.050
You know, kind of a
shifty thing here.

01:01:02.520 --> 01:01:05.079
Here.

01:01:05.080 --> 01:01:07.039
For me?

01:01:07.040 --> 01:01:08.969
Yeah.

01:01:14.200 --> 01:01:16.119
Lower your head.
Bend over.

01:01:16.120 --> 01:01:18.999
Put your... put your head up.

01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:21.839
Down there. Ease up.
That's right. That's right.

01:01:21.840 --> 01:01:24.079
Okay, now,
I'll throw a couple to you.

01:01:24.080 --> 01:01:27.199
Bend over.
You look like a question mark.

01:01:27.200 --> 01:01:30.079
All right.

01:01:30.080 --> 01:01:32.282
- Ready?
- (BOY) Aim low!

01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:37.039
De la rosa sale el espino.

01:01:37.040 --> 01:01:40.799
Del espino sale la rosa.

01:01:40.800 --> 01:01:44.079
From the rose comes the thorn,

01:01:44.080 --> 01:01:47.284
from the thorn comes the rose.

01:01:58.240 --> 01:02:00.999
You're beautiful.

01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:03.282
You're really beautiful.

01:02:09.920 --> 01:02:11.884
- Avigal...
- Shh.

01:02:13.760 --> 01:02:16.639
You see me.

01:13:11.280 --> 01:13:12.719
Preoccupied?

01:13:12.720 --> 01:13:16.279
These things happen.
I'm psychic.

01:13:16.280 --> 01:13:18.639
Maybe it's the money.

01:13:18.640 --> 01:13:20.559
- Mm-hmm.
- Maybe the money's blocking him.

01:13:20.560 --> 01:13:23.599
Listen, we can do it for free if
that's going to make you feel better.

01:13:23.600 --> 01:13:25.484
- Mm-hmm.
- No, it's not.

01:13:28.160 --> 01:13:30.239
- You don't like us anymore?
- No.

01:13:30.240 --> 01:13:32.759
He's in love.

01:13:32.760 --> 01:13:35.167
You think, like real love?

01:13:38.080 --> 01:13:40.169
Yeah.

01:13:42.600 --> 01:13:44.131
Look at him.

01:13:45.960 --> 01:13:48.519
That's beautiful.

01:13:48.520 --> 01:13:50.799
I'm so happy for you.

01:13:50.800 --> 01:13:52.479
Yeah.

(CHIEF REBBE) Has this man
ever studied his oral law?

01:13:55.280 --> 01:13:56.839
(SOL) I have, and I find it

01:13:56.840 --> 01:13:58.399
a dialectical taffy-pull.

01:13:58.400 --> 01:14:00.159
I mean, I have been
taught since I was a kid

01:14:00.160 --> 01:14:02.199
that sex is filthy and forbidden,

01:14:02.200 --> 01:14:04.359
and I think that's the
way it should be.

01:14:04.360 --> 01:14:05.839
And in my opinion,

01:14:05.840 --> 01:14:07.999
the filthier and the
more forbidden it is,

01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:09.599
the more exciting it is.

01:14:09.600 --> 01:14:11.879
I don't think this is the
group to push that point.

01:14:11.880 --> 01:14:14.686
- I'm not a scholar...
- Enough already!

(RABBIS MUTTER)

01:14:20.440 --> 01:14:23.086
Was there fornication?

01:14:24.880 --> 01:14:28.199
The question is, was
there fornication?

01:14:28.200 --> 01:14:29.399
Was there fornication?

01:14:29.400 --> 01:14:32.359
There was no fornication!

01:14:32.360 --> 01:14:35.564
May I speak on my own behalf?

01:14:39.000 --> 01:14:42.568
Please, proceed.

01:14:45.040 --> 01:14:48.244
There was a breach of modesty.

01:14:49.800 --> 01:14:52.731
I was alone with a man.

01:14:54.520 --> 01:14:58.199
He saw my head uncovered.

01:14:58.200 --> 01:15:00.199
You took off your sheytil?

01:15:00.200 --> 01:15:01.399
Yes.

01:15:01.400 --> 01:15:03.079
And your body.

01:15:03.080 --> 01:15:06.090
Did he see it uncovered?

01:15:07.440 --> 01:15:09.999
He placed his hands on my back.

01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:11.759
It was bare?

01:15:11.760 --> 01:15:12.999
Yes.

01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:14.759
(RABBI)
You did that knowing full well

01:15:14.760 --> 01:15:17.719
that what you were
doing was a violation?

01:15:17.720 --> 01:15:18.839
(AVIGAL) I did.

01:15:18.840 --> 01:15:21.771
And you allowed
yourself to be touched?

01:15:23.240 --> 01:15:25.199
Yes.

01:15:25.200 --> 01:15:27.119
And what, may I ask,

01:15:27.120 --> 01:15:29.641
happened next?

01:15:35.920 --> 01:15:37.719
I cried.

01:15:37.720 --> 01:15:40.039
From shame?

01:15:40.040 --> 01:15:42.971
No.

01:15:51.760 --> 01:15:54.440
From loneliness.

(FRENCH SINGING)

01:18:03.840 --> 01:18:05.769
I got jealous.

01:18:10.120 --> 01:18:12.279
It's hard for a man to
understand a woman,

01:18:12.280 --> 01:18:14.448
you know?

01:18:17.240 --> 01:18:20.079
What goes on, you know, the...

01:18:20.080 --> 01:18:21.439
the feelings.

01:18:21.440 --> 01:18:24.405
I know, I know, I'm boring.

01:18:29.240 --> 01:18:30.759
But if a man can't get a woman

01:18:30.760 --> 01:18:33.486
out of his guts...

01:18:35.000 --> 01:18:36.519
if he can't get her
out of his heart,

01:18:36.520 --> 01:18:38.679
it means something.

01:18:38.680 --> 01:18:39.961
Right?

01:18:41.440 --> 01:18:44.689
I'm in love with you, okay?

01:18:46.640 --> 01:18:49.159
All right?

01:18:49.160 --> 01:18:51.159
I know, I know, maybe
you don't love me, but...

01:18:51.160 --> 01:18:52.879
Just be quiet.

01:18:52.880 --> 01:18:56.323
I never said I didn't love you.

01:18:59.160 --> 01:19:01.488
Really?

I've come to say goodbye.

01:19:34.800 --> 01:19:37.479
You didn't have to do that.

01:19:37.480 --> 01:19:39.842
I wanted to.

01:19:44.480 --> 01:19:46.569
What are you going to do?

01:19:48.320 --> 01:19:50.279
I don't know.

01:19:50.280 --> 01:19:51.641
Something.

Donde hay amor,

01:19:55.840 --> 01:19:57.246
hay dolor.

It's true.

Goodbye, Fioravante.

Goodbye, Avigal.

Take care of her.

01:20:26.840 --> 01:20:28.769
Don't worry, I will.

You're not really Jewish, are you?

01:20:45.520 --> 01:20:47.085
I'm not sure.

01:20:48.440 --> 01:20:51.610
Huh.

- Enjoy. You're welcome.

So, you're leaving, right?

01:21:18.800 --> 01:21:19.439
Yep.

01:21:19.440 --> 01:21:22.199
I'm gonna miss you.

01:21:22.200 --> 01:21:26.119
Me too.

I mean, I don't know what to say.

01:21:28.480 --> 01:21:31.759
There's nothing to say.
You just water it.

01:21:31.760 --> 01:21:35.399

then Virgil and Bongo...

01:21:40.240 --> 01:21:41.919
although that was probably,

01:21:41.920 --> 01:21:44.439
in retrospect, a crazy idea.

01:21:44.440 --> 01:21:47.279
Who knows?

01:21:47.280 --> 01:21:48.919
You're definitely going, right?

01:21:48.920 --> 01:21:50.479
That's right.

01:21:50.480 --> 01:21:53.119
So that's funny, because
when you're friendly

with somebody for a long time,

01:21:55.120 --> 01:21:59.039
what happens is, you
develop a, you know,

01:21:59.040 --> 01:22:00.439
like, a shorthand or something,

01:22:00.440 --> 01:22:03.279
a close communication.

01:22:03.280 --> 01:22:05.959
You... You understand one another

01:22:05.960 --> 01:22:08.970
in a...

You go and look up the
little Tunisian girlfriend?

01:22:13.600 --> 01:22:15.599
I don't know.
I mean, I...

01:22:15.600 --> 01:22:18.167
It's funny, I can only speak
to her in present tense.

01:22:18.640 --> 01:22:20.959
Well, maybe if you
spoke to her properly,

01:22:20.960 --> 01:22:23.003
you'd find that you
didn't like her.

01:22:23.640 --> 01:22:25.205
That's a possibility.

01:22:25.640 --> 01:22:27.319
You know, I have a theory

01:22:27.320 --> 01:22:30.319
that sometimes when
you don't understand

01:22:30.320 --> 01:22:31.679
what the other person is saying,

01:22:31.680 --> 01:22:34.799
very often that's a
tremendous advantage.

01:22:34.800 --> 01:22:36.206
Yeah.

Ah, tu parles Francais?

01:22:50.680 --> 01:22:54.039
Mmm, petit peu.

01:22:54.040 --> 01:22:57.239
A gentleman. That's very nice.

01:22:57.240 --> 01:22:59.359
Are you from around here?

01:22:59.360 --> 01:23:02.530
Yeah. Why do you ask?

01:23:04.840 --> 01:23:07.199
Just being neighborly,
and I'm thinking,

01:23:07.200 --> 01:23:10.199
if you ever need a plumber,

01:23:10.200 --> 01:23:12.999
this is the guy.
He's great. A fantastic plumber.

01:23:13.000 --> 01:23:14.959
Oh yeah? Well, that's good to know

01:23:14.960 --> 01:23:16.359
'cause they're hard to come by.

01:23:16.360 --> 01:23:19.399
- Absolutely.
- Mm-hmm.

01:23:19.400 --> 01:23:20.879
What's your name?

01:23:20.880 --> 01:23:23.719
(BOTH) Fioravante.

01:23:23.720 --> 01:23:25.599
That's lovely.
Is that yours?

01:23:25.600 --> 01:23:28.079
He... he got that for me.
He gave me that.

01:23:28.080 --> 01:23:30.408
Mmm.

01:23:32.680 --> 01:23:34.519
You don't look like
a plumber, really.

01:23:34.520 --> 01:23:37.839
That's because he
also does electrical.

01:23:37.840 --> 01:23:39.399
- Oh. Uh-huh.
- Mm-hmm.

01:23:39.400 --> 01:23:41.399
And you come together,
in a package?

01:23:41.400 --> 01:23:44.079
You know, he's shy.
So I handle the dialogue...

01:23:44.080 --> 01:23:45.879
He's shy?
He doesn't look shy.

01:23:45.880 --> 01:23:48.079
- I'm not shy.
- No, actually you're right.

01:23:48.080 --> 01:23:51.079
The truth of the matter
is that he's not shy.

01:23:51.080 --> 01:23:52.879
I'm the shy one of the two.

01:23:52.880 --> 01:23:54.399
You are flirting with me.

01:23:54.400 --> 01:23:55.879
- No.
- Yes.

01:23:55.880 --> 01:23:58.439
I am. I am.
You can tell, right?

01:23:58.440 --> 01:24:00.768
Oh yeah.
I can tell.

01:24:02.520 --> 01:24:05.279
Um, hey, sweetheart,

No problem.

Wow.

01:24:44.440 --> 01:24:50.239

of a very beautiful relationship...

between the three of us.
