WEBVTT

00:00.306 --> 00:01.497
Oh, I will play the game,
Mr. Garrity.

00:01.498 --> 00:02.200
Do it, do it.

00:02.201 --> 00:03.555
I will, and when I make
the national team

00:03.556 --> 00:04.808
and start touring all over the world,

00:04.809 --> 00:05.898
I'll take your daughter with me.

00:05.899 --> 00:06.845
'Cause we're getting married.

00:07.558 --> 00:09.575
I just think that we're
too young right now.

00:09.576 --> 00:11.639
And we're rushing into this,
and I don't wanna make a mistake.

00:11.802 --> 00:12.770
Message received, Lyla.

00:13.018 --> 00:13.730
Loud and clear.

00:13.753 --> 00:14.959
That color looks good on you.

00:15.249 --> 00:16.425
I don't have the money for it.

00:18.094 --> 00:19.471
- Coach, I didn't mean--
- You didn't mean what?

00:19.479 --> 00:21.282
You didn't mean to risk
my reputation, my career.

00:21.287 --> 00:22.020
Is that what
you were gonna say?

00:22.025 --> 00:23.253
- I'm sorry, Coach--
- You thinking about that?

00:23.278 --> 00:24.241
He made a mistake.

00:24.305 --> 00:25.863
And he is trying so desperately

00:25.886 --> 00:27.621
to get back in your good graces

00:27.658 --> 00:29.162
that he's losing
his confidence.

00:29.256 --> 00:30.460
He's losing his passion.

00:30.487 --> 00:31.472
I'm sorry, I was--

00:31.507 --> 00:32.882
I was on
the other side of campus.

00:32.985 --> 00:34.371
You're starting
at tailback tonight.

00:34.876 --> 00:36.151
What the hell?
You want a hug or something?

00:36.155 --> 00:37.001
Get outta here.

00:38.316 --> 00:39.381
Julie finds out about this,

00:39.386 --> 00:40.461
- that's not gonna be good.
- Listen,

00:40.476 --> 00:41.992
you're gonna take a few
pictures,

00:42.075 --> 00:43.050
it's for charity.

00:43.385 --> 00:44.432
Nothing happened at all.

00:44.515 --> 00:46.301
I don't appreciate
getting lied to.

00:46.638 --> 00:47.800
So why don't you go

00:47.806 --> 00:49.423
with your little rally girls

00:49.478 --> 00:50.842
and just leave me alone.

00:57.347 --> 00:58.631
Come on, fellas, let's go!

01:00.138 --> 01:01.060
What do you wanna run?

01:01.066 --> 01:02.803
Slot right 28 Gun-sling.

01:04.385 --> 01:06.331
- You serious?
- Slot right 28 Gun-sling. Go on.

01:07.945 --> 01:08.672
Okay.

01:11.346 --> 01:12.053
What?

01:13.257 --> 01:14.520
Come on, Panthers

01:16.525 --> 01:17.952
Bring it home, boys!

01:19.246 --> 01:20.520
All right, gentlemen,

01:20.526 --> 01:21.583
this is serious.

01:21.818 --> 01:24.073
We're going
slot right 28 Gun-sling.

01:24.075 --> 01:24.933
Okay?

01:24.935 --> 01:25.853
Oh, yeah.

01:25.887 --> 01:28.230
All right, slot right
28 Gun-sling on one.

01:28.636 --> 01:29.703
- Ready.
- Break.

01:30.727 --> 01:32.163
How's those hands
of yours, seven?

01:32.167 --> 01:33.681
- Feeling good, Riggins.
- All right!

01:35.135 --> 01:36.601
Arw you ready for this?

01:37.905 --> 01:39.013
Set!

01:39.095 --> 01:41.070
White 44.

01:42.176 --> 01:44.473
White 44.

01:46.425 --> 01:47.161
Hut!

01:49.975 --> 01:51.323
Saracen takes the snap

01:51.965 --> 01:53.221
and pitches back to Riggins.

01:54.066 --> 01:55.031
To Smash.

01:55.276 --> 01:56.281
What in tarnation?

01:56.288 --> 01:58.100
They got some kind of
a halfback option.

01:58.545 --> 02:00.052
Oh! And Saracen, he's open!

02:00.165 --> 02:02.551
Wide open down
the right sideline!

02:05.505 --> 02:06.951
Oh! He caught it!

02:06.968 --> 02:08.130
Unbelievable!

02:10.235 --> 02:13.281
The Panthers cruise through
their first playoff game.

02:13.508 --> 02:15.460
And the celebration begins

02:15.467 --> 02:17.221
on the Panthers' sidelines.

02:20.886 --> 02:21.811
They said--

02:21.996 --> 02:23.523
They  said we couldn't do it.

02:23.577 --> 02:24.322
Yeah, they did.

02:24.336 --> 02:25.712
They said--

02:25.767 --> 02:27.993
They said we didn't have
what it takes.

02:28.096 --> 02:28.980
Joke's on who?

02:29.808 --> 02:31.032
We got it done,
didn't we?

02:31.095 --> 02:32.750
Yeah!
We got it done!

02:32.755 --> 02:34.382
Yes, Sir. Yes, Sir.
Yes, Sir.

02:34.436 --> 02:36.813
We went out there
and we did it together.

02:38.217 --> 02:40.162
Y'all outta be proud
of yourselves.

02:40.335 --> 02:43.052
And I want you to know
that I am damn proud of you!

02:44.165 --> 02:45.531
Nobody pushes us around.

02:45.707 --> 02:47.311
Nobody pushes us around.

02:47.315 --> 02:48.792
Whose house?
Our house!

02:48.827 --> 02:50.033
Whose house?
Our house!

02:50.038 --> 02:51.400
Whose house?
Our house!

02:51.415 --> 02:52.841
Now that's what
I'm talking about.

02:55.228 --> 02:57.660
You worried about next week's
game against Dunston Valley?

02:57.717 --> 02:58.932
Why, you know something
we don't?

02:58.946 --> 03:00.291
Almost all-white team.

03:00.295 --> 03:01.830
Had some trouble recently
with that hazing

03:01.838 --> 03:03.182
of a player in black face.

03:03.245 --> 03:05.162
Oh, we don't give a dang
about all that.

03:05.185 --> 03:06.883
We're just goin' down there
to play football,

03:07.027 --> 03:09.370
and, God willing, come away
one game closer to State.

03:09.378 --> 03:10.920
Are you saying that race
isn't an issue

03:10.927 --> 03:12.071
for the Dillon Panthers, Mac?

03:12.075 --> 03:12.952
No, sir, it's not.

03:13.016 --> 03:14.583
Yet Dillon was one of the last

03:14.586 --> 03:16.611
high school teams in Texas
to be integrated.

03:16.708 --> 03:18.890
Only one black quarterback
in 40 years.

03:19.068 --> 03:20.880
Voodoo Tatum, he left
after two games.

03:20.887 --> 03:22.853
Which had nothing to do
with his skin color.

03:22.905 --> 03:24.132
Look, you show me a red or

03:24.135 --> 03:25.811
a  black or a green player

03:25.815 --> 03:28.001
here in Dillon that's better
than Matt Saracen,

03:28.007 --> 03:29.221
he's got the job, all right?

03:29.236 --> 03:30.452
What about Smash Williams?

03:30.456 --> 03:31.723
He played quarterback on JV.

03:31.738 --> 03:32.781
He's got quite an arm.

03:32.787 --> 03:33.713
Smash for quarterback?

03:33.798 --> 03:34.202
Yeah.

03:34.256 --> 03:35.712
I believe Smash is better suited

03:35.718 --> 03:36.841
for the position he's in.

03:36.846 --> 03:38.710
- How do you mean?
- Well, guys like Smash

03:38.976 --> 03:40.091
and Baxter and even Voodoo,

03:40.148 --> 03:41.342
they got a natural gift

03:41.347 --> 03:42.322
for running the ball.

03:42.407 --> 03:43.810
All three are black.

03:44.228 --> 03:46.102
Are you saying this gift
has something to do

03:46.106 --> 03:47.031
with their skin color?

03:47.145 --> 03:49.731
What I'm saying, Karen,
and I'm saying it in a good way,

03:49.906 --> 03:51.542
is that guys like Smash
are--

03:51.735 --> 03:52.652
are fearless.

03:52.747 --> 03:54.952
They're dangerous.
They're like junkyard dogs.

03:55.137 --> 03:56.243
I mean, you want them
carrying the ball.

03:56.247 --> 03:58.113
You want them
tearing up turf out there.

04:00.237 --> 04:01.702
So let me get this straight.

04:02.007 --> 04:04.032
Whites like Saracen 
make better quarterbacks

04:04.038 --> 04:05.960
because they're
inherently smarter?

04:06.675 --> 04:08.363
Well, if you wanna put it
that way, you could.

04:08.606 --> 04:10.103
But I'm not saying that
all black guys are--

04:10.105 --> 04:11.031
are dumb.

04:11.075 --> 04:11.963
I'm just saying
that they got diff--

04:11.968 --> 04:13.000
Mac, I need to talk to you.

04:13.385 --> 04:14.731
- Coach, a couple more.
- Coach, we're not done yet.

04:15.377 --> 04:16.721
Sorry, folks,
we're outta time right now.

04:16.726 --> 04:17.872
It's getting late.
You know how it is.

04:20.055 --> 04:21.440
Well,  I think
you got your story.

05:14.923 --> 05:17.219
Mac McGill didn't
use the word "monkey."

05:17.219 --> 05:19.265
He said, "Junkyard dogs."

05:19.644 --> 05:21.381
Monkeys, dogs, frogs--

05:21.389 --> 05:23.533
Mac McGill said
blacks are inhuman.

05:23.536 --> 05:25.121
That they don't think
before they act.

05:25.126 --> 05:26.493
Like they're workhorses

05:26.538 --> 05:27.330
for the white man.

05:27.355 --> 05:29.612
Weel, now, you know
I'm not sure that's what he meant,

05:29.718 --> 05:30.982
but thanks for the call.

05:31.017 --> 05:31.592
Next.

05:31.667 --> 05:33.023
Just 'cause rednecks like Mac

05:33.097 --> 05:34.631
learned it that way
don't make it right.

05:34.908 --> 05:36.241
You can bet if
he's saying this filth

05:36.257 --> 05:37.621
about black folks in public,

05:37.827 --> 05:40.401
him and his kind are saying
a lot worse behind closed doors.

05:41.095 --> 05:43.193
Mac said blacks are shiftless.

05:43.208 --> 05:45.652
That it's the white kids
who are hard workers...

05:45.658 --> 05:46.970
Why everybody so mad at McGill?

05:47.297 --> 05:48.992
God, I mean,
he ain't that bad.

05:49.147 --> 05:50.550
He just says
dumb stuff sometimes.

05:50.737 --> 05:51.900
And that's an excuse?

05:51.967 --> 05:53.052
Y'all need to stop.

05:53.106 --> 05:54.871
We got bigger things
to worry about.

05:55.576 --> 05:56.431
Now there she is.

05:57.486 --> 05:59.113
- Oh, it's nice.
- That's the house you're talking about?

05:59.397 --> 06:00.873
I mean, that's a real house.

06:01.027 --> 06:01.991
Yes, I know it.

06:02.227 --> 06:03.622
Dang, this is so nice.

06:03.625 --> 06:05.913
Wow, Mama, did you see
the size of that closet?

06:05.955 --> 06:07.363
Oh, that's gonna be
my dressing room.

06:07.465 --> 06:08.333
No it's not.

06:08.346 --> 06:09.453
Only if I get
the second bathroom.

06:09.456 --> 06:10.373
Listen. Listen.
Wait a minute, child,

06:10.377 --> 06:11.682
we don't own any of it.

06:11.946 --> 06:14.550
That could change if you let me
submit the bid we discussed.

06:17.688 --> 06:18.550
Well...

06:19.898 --> 06:21.320
Mom, you said

06:21.327 --> 06:22.770
with the 10% down
we could cover it

06:22.778 --> 06:23.263
come on.

06:23.266 --> 06:24.943
Well, that is until I get sick

06:24.948 --> 06:27.070
or, God forbid, one of y'all
has an accident.

06:27.805 --> 06:29.020
Well, I guess we could

06:29.207 --> 06:30.702
just keep dreaming then.

06:31.008 --> 06:33.110
Come back every few days
'til somebody else buys it.

06:33.456 --> 06:35.361
I knew I shouldn't
have brought y'all.

06:37.088 --> 06:38.202
But it is nice, huh?

06:38.318 --> 06:39.682
- For real.
- Yeah.

06:41.565 --> 06:42.763
You skipped class?

06:44.157 --> 06:45.653
Julie, you skipped class?

06:46.135 --> 06:47.540
It was only one time.

06:48.138 --> 06:50.460
Ms. Carroll told me
you skipped three classes.

06:51.768 --> 06:53.601
It was just P.E.

07:00.726 --> 07:02.362
Look, Ms. Taylor,
we're really sorry.

07:02.365 --> 07:03.400
We will never do it again.

07:03.435 --> 07:05.853
Well, Tyra, that really sounds
like a hollow apology to me.

07:05.925 --> 07:07.113
So you can just save it.

07:08.697 --> 07:10.112
But I'll tell you
what you are gonna do

07:10.116 --> 07:12.123
is you're gonna be in P.E.
for every class

07:12.165 --> 07:13.580
for the rest of the semester.

07:14.065 --> 07:16.521
And in terms of making up
the classes that you missed,

07:17.028 --> 07:18.643
Ms. Carroll made
a real good suggestion.

07:19.036 --> 07:20.670
Which is that both of y'all
are gonna play

07:20.675 --> 07:21.710
in the Powderpuff game.

07:21.808 --> 07:23.351
Practices start this afternoon.

07:23.357 --> 07:24.250
You will not miss one of them.

07:24.255 --> 07:25.743
You have got
to be kidding me.

07:25.748 --> 07:27.260
- You wouldn't do that.
- Do I look like I'm kidding y'all?

07:27.637 --> 07:29.193
You wouldn't--
You wouldn't do that to me.

07:29.227 --> 07:30.180
Yeah, I would.

07:31.037 --> 07:31.692
But...

07:31.958 --> 07:32.952
Now, listen up

07:36.687 --> 07:37.611
Why is he here?

07:37.657 --> 07:39.403
This is gonna be so awkward.

07:41.595 --> 07:42.372
Ladies.

07:42.877 --> 07:43.490
Ladies.

07:43.907 --> 07:45.541
Over here.
I'm Landry Clarke.

07:45.556 --> 07:46.533
Your official

07:46.566 --> 07:47.933
Powderpuff referee.

07:48.075 --> 07:49.423
Just wanted
to start things off,

07:49.487 --> 07:51.453
and say, uh, let's just
keep this clean.

07:51.507 --> 07:52.693
And let's just play this--

07:52.985 --> 07:54.382
this beautiful game in--

07:54.436 --> 07:56.182
in the spirit that it
was meant to be played in.

07:56.185 --> 07:57.090
Thank you, Landry.

07:58.455 --> 08:00.150
Now ladies, let's meet.
this year's

08:00.158 --> 08:02.171
Powderpuff Panther coaches.
Huh?

08:04.096 --> 08:06.880
We've got Matthew Saracen
and Timothy Riggins.

08:08.527 --> 08:10.123
You can shoot me now
if you want to.

08:10.127 --> 08:10.900
All right, Tim,

08:11.116 --> 08:12.902
- you call it.
- Tails, ma'am.

08:14.015 --> 08:15.102
Matt, you get first pick.

08:15.118 --> 08:15.781
Okay.

08:20.696 --> 08:23.330
Okay, uh, I pick Tyra, please.

08:25.628 --> 08:26.990
All right, Tyra.

08:31.738 --> 08:32.590
Tim?

08:32.787 --> 08:34.813
Does anyone here
know how to chop block?

08:35.707 --> 08:36.442
I do.

08:36.506 --> 08:37.611
Nice, let's go.

08:37.875 --> 08:38.903
All right.

08:42.405 --> 08:43.313
Uh...Laurel.

08:44.034 --> 08:45.613
Good call, Laurel.

08:49.096 --> 08:50.263
Let's go, Garrity.

08:57.805 --> 08:59.061
Um, I'm gonna pick

08:59.068 --> 09:00.571
Julie Taylor, please.

09:01.118 --> 09:02.291
- Please.
- Come on, Julie!

09:10.736 --> 09:11.452
Great.

09:31.128 --> 09:32.091
Hey, how you doin'?

09:32.525 --> 09:33.622
Good, how're you?

09:41.008 --> 09:42.181
How ya doin'?

09:43.185 --> 09:44.320
I'm doing good, man.

09:44.805 --> 09:46.800
Little bit crazy for me
to come back to school.

09:46.975 --> 09:48.670
Had a free pass here
for a while but...

09:50.348 --> 09:51.390
I'll catch y'all later.

09:57.685 --> 10:00.570
Only applies to certain
rural interstates

10:00.578 --> 10:01.902
in specified counties.

10:02.465 --> 10:03.892
Y'all  just think about that--

10:04.945 --> 10:06.292
Hey, guys.
Can I talk to you a minute?

10:06.598 --> 10:07.170
Yeah.

10:07.725 --> 10:09.221
Uh...read your books.

10:09.317 --> 10:10.323
I'll get the questions later.

10:10.337 --> 10:11.630
You guys wanna get
a driver's license,

10:11.778 --> 10:12.911
you gotta know
the finer points.

10:19.286 --> 10:20.421
Been listening
to the radio, huh?

10:20.425 --> 10:22.172
I just got done talking
to the superintendent.

10:22.175 --> 10:23.802
They're getting calls
from newspapers and stations

10:23.836 --> 10:24.861
all over the state.

10:24.985 --> 10:26.400
Like they got nothing else
better to do.

10:26.408 --> 10:27.553
You need to issue

10:27.657 --> 10:28.841
a public apology.

10:28.958 --> 10:29.880
Apology for what?

10:29.908 --> 10:30.651
For being truthful?

10:30.656 --> 10:31.753
That's not the way
people heard it.

10:31.828 --> 10:32.602
What--what people?

10:32.635 --> 10:34.012
A bunch of damn P.C.
sons of bitches

10:34.016 --> 10:35.303
trying to get my job?

10:35.338 --> 10:37.570
Afraid it's not just
a bunch of sons of bitches.

10:38.218 --> 10:39.291
Well, all right.

10:39.586 --> 10:41.441
You're telling me
that you think Matt Saracen

10:41.476 --> 10:44.060
has as much natural ability
as a Smash?

10:44.188 --> 10:45.631
What I'm telling you

10:45.636 --> 10:47.653
is that it's not
too damn smart

10:47.827 --> 10:49.251
to be making generalizations

10:49.256 --> 10:50.390
about people's abilities 

10:50.396 --> 10:52.511
based on their color.
Think about that.

10:53.166 --> 10:54.570
That's what I'm saying.

10:54.577 --> 10:55.710
All right. All right.

10:55.948 --> 10:57.090
What's done is done.

10:57.635 --> 10:59.092
No apology's
gonna change that.

11:00.317 --> 11:02.123
I'm not making a request.

11:12.888 --> 11:14.292
And you ain't gonna share?

11:15.347 --> 11:17.301
I thought you were
on some kind of special diet.

11:17.437 --> 11:18.262
I  am.

11:18.407 --> 11:19.380
No sweets.

11:19.786 --> 11:21.003
Except for sweet chocolate.

11:24.177 --> 11:25.240
Here you go, baby.

11:27.505 --> 11:28.620
I wasn't talking about
the cake.

11:33.915 --> 11:35.481
Mmm, okay enough.

11:35.835 --> 11:36.640
Enough.

11:39.556 --> 11:41.441
I can't believe
I picked Julie third.

11:41.445 --> 11:43.080
I mean she--
Now she hates me.

11:43.317 --> 11:44.372
I'm tellin' you, I was reading

11:44.415 --> 11:45.612
up on pheromones last night.

11:45.615 --> 11:47.003
I really think they work.

11:47.246 --> 11:49.130
There's no smell
that's gonna make Julie

11:49.135 --> 11:50.210
not hate me anymore.

11:50.386 --> 11:52.183
A lot of studies
have shown that

11:52.586 --> 11:53.750
responses to odors,

11:54.125 --> 11:55.531
you know,
depend on emotions

11:55.576 --> 11:57.413
felt whenever
that odor was first smelled.

11:57.417 --> 11:58.601
Okay, even if that wasn't

11:58.605 --> 12:00.460
the stupidest thing
that I've ever heard,

12:00.686 --> 12:01.590
I mean, I don't even know what

12:01.608 --> 12:03.022
kinda smells Julie would like.

12:03.026 --> 12:05.491
Well, I mean, she likes
her dad, doesn't she?

12:06.875 --> 12:09.352
So, why don't you figure out
what type of soap he uses.

12:09.945 --> 12:11.693
Then you can go out
and get that kind of soap.

12:11.938 --> 12:12.800
You're retarded.

12:12.857 --> 12:14.082
Hey, at least just try it.

12:14.088 --> 12:15.291
Hey, guys, guys,
check it out, man.

12:15.338 --> 12:16.401
Mac's on TV.

12:17.585 --> 12:18.761
Let me turn it up.

12:25.816 --> 12:28.332
I believe that all of our
players, regardless of color,

12:29.008 --> 12:30.512
contribute to the spirit
and the success

12:30.527 --> 12:31.852
of the Dillon Panthers.

12:32.797 --> 12:35.242
My comments were not intended
to hurt anybody.

12:35.818 --> 12:37.371
And I apologize if they did.

12:38.367 --> 12:39.122
Thank you.

12:41.207 --> 12:42.942
Has there been any talk
of suspension?

12:43.508 --> 12:44.973
Are you gonna meet
with the players?

12:44.975 --> 12:45.940
Coach, just one question. 

12:46.217 --> 12:47.131
What was that?

12:47.306 --> 12:48.471
You call that an apology?

12:48.567 --> 12:50.142
Tell me what else
you'd call that, then.

12:50.148 --> 12:51.993
A lame-ass excuse.

12:52.608 --> 12:53.602
What is the big deal?

12:53.615 --> 12:55.590
I mean it's not like he yelled
out racist slurs or anything.

12:55.597 --> 12:56.861
Yeah, but if we were up at UT

12:56.867 --> 12:58.202
right  now, he'd be fired.

12:58.208 --> 12:58.902
Exactly.

12:58.905 --> 13:00.261
Fortunately for us,
he's not.

13:00.267 --> 13:01.013
Yeah, that's easy
for you to say

13:01.017 --> 13:02.872
'cause you're white
and obviously selfish.

13:04.955 --> 13:06.191
Come on, y'all,
it ain't that deep.

13:06.308 --> 13:07.380
What you want Mac to do,

13:07.598 --> 13:08.451
pay out reparations

13:08.455 --> 13:09.832
to all the Negroes in Dillon?

13:13.768 --> 13:14.622
Bye.

13:15.026 --> 13:15.993
Wave.

13:16.068 --> 13:17.393
We was just playing.

13:17.617 --> 13:19.820
Yeah, well,
enjoy your sandbox, boys.

13:22.865 --> 13:24.233
A year of detention

13:24.338 --> 13:25.730
is preferable to Powderpuff.

13:25.868 --> 13:26.971
Okay, I don't need
to spend a week

13:26.978 --> 13:29.742
watching Tim Riggins teach
rally girls how to tackle.

13:29.886 --> 13:30.853
It's pathetic.

13:31.288 --> 13:33.121
Oh, and then he has the gall

13:33.256 --> 13:34.710
to pick that bony little--

13:34.717 --> 13:36.162
- Lyla.
- Hey, guys.

13:36.865 --> 13:38.593
Hey, Tyra, my dad says
your mom's doing

13:38.597 --> 13:39.473
really good on the job.

13:39.586 --> 13:40.263
Really?

13:40.835 --> 13:43.142
Wow, maybe she'll get
her own dealership one day.

13:45.148 --> 13:46.043
Yeah, I just thought

13:46.048 --> 13:47.700
it'd be good to know
she's doing really well.

13:49.146 --> 13:50.491
That's real nice to know.

13:54.977 --> 13:55.980
Hey, Tyra.

13:56.108 --> 13:57.703
I was surprised to see you
on the field today.

13:57.777 --> 14:00.012
Thought you hated football.

14:02.958 --> 14:04.722
You know what,
I changed my mind.

14:05.768 --> 14:08.082
I'm gonna get real
into Powderpuff this year.

14:08.618 --> 14:11.001
If you want, I'll jack up Greer
for disrespecting you.

14:11.077 --> 14:12.792
Okay, you know
it's not about me.

14:12.798 --> 14:15.292
It's about you taking
this Mac thing seriously.

14:15.448 --> 14:17.543
Wave, I'm not Jesse Jackson,

14:17.638 --> 14:19.012
all right?
My cause is football.

14:19.016 --> 14:20.353
Okay then, who are you?

14:20.355 --> 14:22.311
Because it shouldn't mean
playing dumb.

14:22.896 --> 14:24.251
Look, I don't see Matty or Rigg

14:24.258 --> 14:25.283
jumping up on a soap box

14:25.287 --> 14:27.040
every time a brother
says something messed up.

14:27.057 --> 14:29.232
You know why, 'cause it's
a completely different thing.

14:29.238 --> 14:30.912
Well, then,
that's racist right there.

14:31.108 --> 14:34.082
Me being expected to act
differently 'cause I'm black.

14:35.858 --> 14:38.030
That's kinda the burden
that you were born with, baby.

14:39.006 --> 14:40.622
The burden
and the blessing.

14:41.387 --> 14:42.873
You know, you get all

14:42.927 --> 14:45.052
sexy, sexy
when you get all preachy.

14:45.068 --> 14:46.363
You know what, Brian,
don't do this, okay.

14:46.365 --> 14:48.181
Don't turn this into a joke.

14:48.908 --> 14:51.093
It's important, I want you
to really think about this.

14:51.687 --> 14:53.282
Wave, I respect
your opinion on this.

14:54.087 --> 14:54.843
I do.

14:55.498 --> 14:57.611
But could you please just
recognize for one second

14:57.626 --> 14:59.633
that I just got through
some real drama.

15:00.087 --> 15:01.950
I mean, I'm just getting
my swagger back.

15:02.378 --> 15:05.143
I can't be sidetracked with
things I can't control, baby.

15:05.498 --> 15:06.763
Look...

15:07.517 --> 15:09.781
I know that you're dealing
with a lot right now.

15:10.127 --> 15:12.130
Okay, and I'm here for you.

15:12.355 --> 15:13.693
But sooner or later,

15:14.197 --> 15:16.883
you're gonna have to peek out
from behind those blinders.

15:22.845 --> 15:24.072
Okay, I wanna see

15:24.307 --> 15:26.280
both partners
using the scalpel.

15:27.145 --> 15:28.793
And both partners
taking notes.

15:37.067 --> 15:38.480
All right, I'm ready.
You ready?

15:38.888 --> 15:40.172
- I guess.
- You sure?

15:41.197 --> 15:42.832
Now, look, if it's--
if it's any consolation,

15:42.836 --> 15:44.462
I--I heard that these frogs
had a very long

15:44.487 --> 15:45.802
and fulfilling life.

15:45.807 --> 15:46.542
So it's all right.

15:46.696 --> 15:47.971
Lots of flies.

15:48.335 --> 15:49.101
And lots of...

15:49.816 --> 15:51.070
Tadpoles.

15:59.227 --> 16:00.272
You want me to do this?

16:00.788 --> 16:01.852
'Cause I can.

16:01.997 --> 16:03.740
No, no, no, I got it.
Don't worry about it.

16:06.625 --> 16:07.640
All right, well,

16:07.765 --> 16:09.342
just give me a minute.

16:09.988 --> 16:11.190
Is everything good?

16:11.387 --> 16:12.880
Yes, sir, Mr. Utz,
we were just...

16:13.325 --> 16:15.110
just getting started.

16:17.227 --> 16:19.041
Now, Jason, if you just
wanna observe, it's okay.

16:19.046 --> 16:20.781
It's all anybody expects.

16:28.215 --> 16:30.681
No, I'd like to just go ahead
and finish the incision.

16:30.917 --> 16:31.731
It's up to you.

16:37.695 --> 16:38.902
Let's go for ten, ladies.

16:38.908 --> 16:40.630
As one, count 'em out as ten.

16:40.655 --> 16:44.381
- One...two...three.
- Let's go!

16:44.425 --> 16:45.581
As one, come on.

16:46.815 --> 16:48.291
D-split 45, Garrity.

16:48.615 --> 16:49.621
Hut--hut.

16:49.628 --> 16:51.523
Let's go, ladies.
Let's go.

16:53.726 --> 16:55.472
Nice.
Good execution.

16:56.026 --> 16:57.480
I'm starting
to see something, ladies.

16:57.738 --> 16:58.801
Get some blocks, here.

16:58.805 --> 17:00.842
- Let's get some blocks.
- Ready, 44...

17:01.135 --> 17:03.243
Hot--hot crossfire.

17:03.377 --> 17:04.912
Set, uh, hut--hut--hut.

17:04.967 --> 17:05.972
There ya' go.
Now go, now go.

17:05.976 --> 17:07.233
Oh, bad, bad, okay.

17:07.238 --> 17:09.261
We are a team of one, ladies.

17:09.266 --> 17:11.501
That's fine um, you just wanna
make sure you catch this.

17:11.578 --> 17:13.492
One unit.
Let's go, let's go.

17:13.585 --> 17:15.221
We've got to get this together.
Hey, Matt!

17:15.346 --> 17:16.843
- Yeah?
- Figure out what the hell

17:16.848 --> 17:18.002
you want me to do.

17:18.445 --> 17:20.060
You see that team over there?

17:20.318 --> 17:21.103
Yeah.

17:21.318 --> 17:22.711
Looks a lot better than us.

17:24.875 --> 17:26.501
Set.
Hut--hut!

17:27.146 --> 17:28.423
Yes, you got the snap.

17:30.958 --> 17:31.843
What was that?

17:32.187 --> 17:33.653
You throw like a damn girl.

17:34.215 --> 17:35.323
Are you serious, Matt?

17:35.686 --> 17:36.841
That is your quarterback?

17:37.187 --> 17:38.310
She's really good
at handing off.

17:38.318 --> 17:39.241
Good job, Coach.

17:39.618 --> 17:40.372
Hut--hut.

17:42.648 --> 17:44.271
Oh, I'm--
I'm sorry.

17:44.278 --> 17:45.942
- Really? Really?
- I'm sorry.

17:45.946 --> 17:46.843
Hold on.
Not her, not her.

17:46.977 --> 17:48.593
It's all right.
It's all right, we're a team.

17:48.598 --> 17:49.552
Teammates.

17:49.556 --> 17:52.251
I'm starting to see a "W"
in my eyes, let's go!

17:55.295 --> 17:57.563
Matt, okay,
this isn't working for me.

17:57.575 --> 17:58.983
It's not working
for me either.

18:02.235 --> 18:03.100
Hi.

18:03.986 --> 18:04.820
Julie?

18:05.048 --> 18:05.602
Yep.

18:05.976 --> 18:07.822
You think maybe you could
play quarterback?

18:09.206 --> 18:11.213
Hmm, let's see,
I was your third pick.

18:11.226 --> 18:13.831
Am I even qualified
to talk to QB one?

18:14.458 --> 18:16.451
You're the only one
who knows how to play.

18:16.785 --> 18:18.670
I do know how to play.
But, uh,

18:19.328 --> 18:20.242
frankly.....

18:21.186 --> 18:22.002
I don't care.

18:22.005 --> 18:24.251
Um, excuse me.
Lovebirds.

18:25.128 --> 18:26.023
Let's go.

18:26.778 --> 18:27.523
Practice.

18:28.356 --> 18:29.311
Please.

18:33.358 --> 18:34.643
You're pathetic.

18:34.977 --> 18:36.523
This is now
about victory.

18:36.526 --> 18:37.400
Line up!

18:39.145 --> 18:40.823
Let's go.
Strength and stamina.

18:41.038 --> 18:42.483
One of your teammates gets hurt,

18:42.737 --> 18:43.833
gets tired out there.

18:43.836 --> 18:45.570
You step in,
help carry the weight.

18:45.846 --> 18:47.132
You give 'em a hand.

18:47.736 --> 18:48.533
Let's go!

18:57.445 --> 18:58.390
Let's go!

19:01.305 --> 19:02.671
Come on, man,
stop slackin'.

19:02.796 --> 19:04.063
Oh, yeah? Wait 'til your turn.

19:04.127 --> 19:05.550
We'll see how fast you go.

19:05.646 --> 19:07.513
Stop the chatter,
let's get it done.

19:07.575 --> 19:08.571
Yes sir, Massa.

19:08.855 --> 19:10.080
What'd you say, Seale?

19:10.127 --> 19:11.250
I love this drill, sir.

19:11.405 --> 19:12.641
Get your ass down the field!

19:12.697 --> 19:13.540
- Love it.
- Move it.

19:14.055 --> 19:15.040
- Yes, sir.
- Move it!

19:15.076 --> 19:15.641
Yes, sir.

19:15.716 --> 19:16.953
You shut your mouth!

19:21.958 --> 19:22.662
Hey, baby.

19:24.876 --> 19:25.751
Honey,

19:26.416 --> 19:28.682
I just broke up a fight
in the hallway.

19:29.807 --> 19:31.313
Over this whole
Mac McGill thing.

19:32.248 --> 19:33.001
Well...

19:34.495 --> 19:35.790
I don't know
what to tell you, babe.

19:35.997 --> 19:36.822
Well, I don't know.

19:36.825 --> 19:38.461
I mean, just it's clear to me
that it's not--

19:38.467 --> 19:39.901
This thing is not going away.

19:40.076 --> 19:41.643
I mean, these kids
were riled up.

19:41.645 --> 19:43.783
And it was a lot of kids.
And it was black against white.

19:43.788 --> 19:44.753
It was racial.

19:44.845 --> 19:46.902
Look babe, he said
something stupid, all right?

19:46.978 --> 19:47.912
He said something stupid.

19:48.005 --> 19:48.802
He made an apology.

19:48.808 --> 19:49.702
- I know.
- There's gonna be fallout,

19:49.708 --> 19:51.090
- there's no way around that.
- I know, I know, I know,

19:51.097 --> 19:52.731
but I feel like--
I feel like I--

19:53.115 --> 19:54.093
I wanna do--
I wanna have

19:54.096 --> 19:55.232
some kind of a dialogue

19:55.235 --> 19:56.180
for the kids, you know.

19:56.186 --> 19:58.343
I wanna create, maybe, something
after school later this week.

19:58.415 --> 20:00.110
- Like a forum or something.
- A forum?

20:00.355 --> 20:01.681
Yeah, you know,
where the kids can come

20:01.685 --> 20:03.140
and talk to each other
and air it out.

20:03.248 --> 20:05.020
So that it's not just
coming up with their fists

20:05.028 --> 20:06.210
in the middle of the hallway.

20:06.505 --> 20:07.311
You know what I mean?

20:07.406 --> 20:08.483
Yeah, that's a good idea.

20:10.376 --> 20:11.751
Will you tell your
football players about it?

20:12.125 --> 20:14.223
I think it could certainly
be good for them to come.

20:15.116 --> 20:15.870
Sure.

20:16.377 --> 20:17.832
Appreciate the support.

20:18.775 --> 20:20.543
- I'll see you later.
- All right, have a good day.

20:20.965 --> 20:21.631
Okay.

20:44.766 --> 20:45.860
You got a steering wheel.

20:45.867 --> 20:48.170
You got your brake, you got
your accelerator, all right?

20:48.178 --> 20:48.702
Where would they be?

20:48.996 --> 20:50.353
Well, look,
this lever over here,

20:50.357 --> 20:51.471
you wanna go ahead and push it.

20:51.708 --> 20:53.090
Yeah, go ahead
and push it forward.

20:53.158 --> 20:53.710
Forward?
Okay.

20:53.726 --> 20:54.901
Forward is brake, right.

20:54.946 --> 20:56.263
If you wanna accelerate,

20:56.726 --> 20:58.253
you wanna go ahead
and push it on down

20:58.306 --> 20:59.243
toward your knee.

20:59.345 --> 21:01.293
There ya go, down--
Woo-hoo.

21:01.388 --> 21:02.530
There ya go.
All right, all right.

21:03.535 --> 21:05.220
All right, so you wanna
put it in drive.

21:05.345 --> 21:06.463
And let's check it out.

21:06.778 --> 21:08.101
See how this puppy rolls.

21:08.797 --> 21:09.902
Off on the brake.

21:09.905 --> 21:11.272
Oh, don't be shy.
Don't be shy.

21:11.278 --> 21:12.370
Straight on through?

21:12.438 --> 21:13.151
All right, all right.

21:13.245 --> 21:14.743
Next stop, Indy 500, huh?

21:14.856 --> 21:16.423
Shut up, I'm trying
to get used to it, all right?

21:16.496 --> 21:17.933
Just give me a minute.

21:18.098 --> 21:18.733
I got it.

21:18.735 --> 21:20.581
And once you get comfortable,
how's that feel?

21:20.798 --> 21:21.600
It feels okay.

21:21.606 --> 21:22.300
Yeah?

21:22.535 --> 21:23.022
Yeah.

21:23.048 --> 21:23.692
This is pretty easy,

21:23.697 --> 21:25.412
- I could get the hang of this.
- You like it, huh?

21:25.497 --> 21:26.171
Yeah.

21:26.526 --> 21:27.332
Yeah, it's nice

21:27.387 --> 21:28.630
Yeah, a little bit of freedom?

21:28.685 --> 21:29.982
I could get used to it.

21:30.155 --> 21:31.490
Speaking of
getting used to it,

21:31.667 --> 21:33.360
how's being back at school
treating ya?

21:34.975 --> 21:35.770
It's okay.

21:35.775 --> 21:36.403
I guess.

21:37.146 --> 21:37.860
Yeah?

21:38.955 --> 21:40.471
Listen, when you
got out of the hospital,

21:41.785 --> 21:44.033
was everybody
just weird to you?

21:44.937 --> 21:47.461
Man, I felt like
I was 100 years old.

21:48.006 --> 21:48.891
You know, like, uh,

21:49.218 --> 21:50.490
there was some sort of secret

21:50.495 --> 21:52.910
knowledge no one else possessed.
You know.

21:53.765 --> 21:55.190
I mean, for a while there
actually I

21:55.537 --> 21:56.960
wanted to go back
to the hospital.

21:57.198 --> 21:58.423
Of course, that was partially
'cause there was

21:58.427 --> 22:00.750
this hot-ass nurse that just
could not get enough of me.

22:00.756 --> 22:01.631
Oh, I'm sure she couldn't.

22:03.867 --> 22:05.911
You know, I just want things
to feel normal again, you know?

22:06.217 --> 22:08.601
Yeah, well,
I hate to break it to you,

22:08.685 --> 22:11.770
but high school is not normal.

22:12.188 --> 22:13.502
- Brake.
- Brake?

22:13.616 --> 22:15.120
Brake.
Brake!

22:26.197 --> 22:27.081
There ya go.

22:27.726 --> 22:28.622
You have a good one.

22:31.025 --> 22:32.490
Think I'm gonna take off.

22:32.707 --> 22:33.902
Okay, so, uh--

22:34.227 --> 22:35.240
Don't worry,
I got your numbers.

22:35.248 --> 22:36.180
I got your numbers
and everything.

22:36.186 --> 22:37.293
- You good?
- I'm good.

22:37.387 --> 22:38.440
Okay.
Cool.

22:40.298 --> 22:42.491
Hey look, Smash,
I don't think it's right.

22:43.546 --> 22:45.742
What Mac said, I don't--
I don't agree with it.

22:45.878 --> 22:47.221
So you think
I should quarterback?

22:48.205 --> 22:50.121
No--I mean, yeah.
I mean, I don't know.

22:50.277 --> 22:52.741
- I mean, I don't know if you play--
- I'm just playing with you, Matty.

22:53.256 --> 22:55.263
I know what you're trying to
say, but I ain't sweatin' it.

22:55.776 --> 22:56.762
Neither should you.

22:57.605 --> 22:58.830
- You sure?
- Yeah.

23:00.165 --> 23:01.152
Yeah, it's cool.

23:01.258 --> 23:02.022
All right.

23:02.218 --> 23:03.700
- I'll see you tomorrow.
- All right, later.

23:08.256 --> 23:09.741
- Hello?
- Hey.

23:11.536 --> 23:12.821
Hey, honey, how you doin'?

23:13.267 --> 23:14.243
Grand.

23:14.628 --> 23:16.022
How was Powderpuff?

23:16.218 --> 23:17.080
It was great.

23:17.318 --> 23:18.951
Oh, was
Powderpuff tiring?

23:19.517 --> 23:20.281
Where's the supper?

23:20.287 --> 23:21.871
Oh, I don't know.
Why don't you sit down?

23:23.256 --> 23:23.980
Don't--

23:24.138 --> 23:26.022
Don't roll your eyes.

23:28.206 --> 23:29.462
Something else
is gonna happen

23:29.478 --> 23:31.092
other than
this Powderpuff thing

23:31.518 --> 23:32.322
as a punishment

23:32.416 --> 23:33.831
for you cutting class.

23:34.056 --> 23:34.931
I promise you

23:35.098 --> 23:36.400
your mom and I will
let you know

23:36.466 --> 23:38.772
what it is when we
figure out what it is.

23:39.016 --> 23:40.081
Yep, that's understood.

23:40.088 --> 23:41.811
And when you figure out
what my punishment is,

23:41.815 --> 23:42.712
- I'll be in my bedroom.

23:42.717 --> 23:43.783
I don't want you
to be flippant with me.

23:43.925 --> 23:44.892
I don't want you
to be flippant.

23:45.208 --> 23:46.930
- Did you hear what he just said?
- Can I tell you something?

23:47.006 --> 23:49.100
- Yes, I heard.
- No, no, look at me.

23:50.418 --> 23:52.112
Please, don't do this.

23:53.087 --> 23:54.073
Don't break our trust.

23:54.198 --> 23:55.950
Don't take our trust
from us.

23:59.437 --> 24:00.093
Please.

24:02.316 --> 24:03.931
I'm sorry, today's just
been really...

24:05.178 --> 24:06.540
Really kind of
a crappy day.

24:06.628 --> 24:08.303
Matt's been yelling
at me all day about...

24:08.997 --> 24:12.073
Stupid quarterback stuff.

24:14.497 --> 24:16.251
Matt Saracen's got you
at quarterback?

24:19.088 --> 24:20.221
Wait, honey.

24:20.407 --> 24:21.783
Hey, come here.

24:22.215 --> 24:23.920
What do you mean
he's got you at quarterback?

24:30.048 --> 24:31.142
Two-zero.

24:32.408 --> 24:33.452
Hey, what up, Dutch Boy?

24:33.997 --> 24:36.011
- Get a new haircut?
- Get a new hat?

24:38.545 --> 24:39.442
What's your order, man?

24:40.128 --> 24:41.762
I've actually been
doing some thinking.

24:42.517 --> 24:45.143
You know all this friction
between the team?

24:45.816 --> 24:47.201
It's just not helping
right now, man.

24:47.716 --> 24:49.062
And State's coming up, so...

24:49.378 --> 24:50.413
You got that right.

24:50.627 --> 24:51.561
So, I mean,

24:51.757 --> 24:54.161
I figure you talk to your boys
and settle 'em down.

24:54.178 --> 24:56.812
And we can just refocus
on the game. You know?

24:58.518 --> 24:59.623
You got some nerve.

25:00.628 --> 25:02.972
The same dude who shows up
half-drunk to workouts,

25:03.396 --> 25:04.793
walks off practice, and throws

25:04.796 --> 25:07.562
a glass bottle at my head
wants to tell me to talk to my boys?

25:07.736 --> 25:09.772
I didn't tell you.
I asked you, Williams.

25:09.917 --> 25:11.220
No, first of all,

25:11.486 --> 25:12.433
they ain't my boys.

25:12.725 --> 25:14.712
You want team unity,
why don't you talk to your boys?

25:14.896 --> 25:16.852
This football done brought us
together, but on the real,

25:17.085 --> 25:18.311
we ain't even cool like that.

25:19.387 --> 25:20.782
You're a lost cause,
Williams.

25:31.068 --> 25:31.751
Mom?

25:34.137 --> 25:34.821
Mom?

25:40.356 --> 25:41.243
Hello?

25:41.978 --> 25:42.733
Hey.

25:43.165 --> 25:44.240
Here, honey.

25:46.006 --> 25:46.743
Hey, Mama.

25:47.037 --> 25:47.891
Ready to go?

25:47.966 --> 25:49.020
Uh, you know...

25:49.927 --> 25:51.613
I'm so sorry
I didn't call you.

25:51.616 --> 25:54.033
I--I--I--
I gotta get through a...

25:54.616 --> 25:57.013
Stack of papers.
I'm so sorry, honey.

25:57.018 --> 25:58.331
It's okay. Well, it's good
to see you working.

26:01.605 --> 26:02.413
Hey, Tyra.

26:02.575 --> 26:03.220
Hi

26:03.236 --> 26:04.181
How you doin'?

26:04.387 --> 26:06.332
I'm great.
How're you?

26:06.667 --> 26:07.780
Good.
Oh, we're just fine.

26:07.787 --> 26:08.971
Your mom is the greatest.

26:09.066 --> 26:10.603
She volunteered to help me out

26:10.728 --> 26:12.290
and finish out tonight.
She knows everything.

26:12.366 --> 26:13.513
Well, she's a smart woman.

26:13.516 --> 26:15.803
I'm just gonna--
I'll just call, you know,

26:15.806 --> 26:17.652
I'll just call Mindy for a ride
later, when we're done.

26:18.386 --> 26:19.173
Yeah.

26:20.397 --> 26:20.933
Okay.

26:21.686 --> 26:22.301
Good.

26:23.498 --> 26:24.372
All right, honey.

26:24.395 --> 26:25.191
See you later.

26:25.396 --> 26:26.603
Oh, good to see you, Tyra.

26:26.696 --> 26:27.553
Yeah.

26:30.476 --> 26:31.383
See ya.

26:34.317 --> 26:35.372
Pro-left

26:35.797 --> 26:37.291
25 sprint option.

26:37.348 --> 26:37.932
Now say it.

26:38.216 --> 26:39.812
Pro-left 25 sprint option.

26:39.838 --> 26:41.220
Nice, what that means is--

26:41.356 --> 26:43.063
That means that you're gonna
fake to the two back

26:43.206 --> 26:44.320
through the five hole.

26:44.458 --> 26:45.482
You're gonna be moving down

26:45.498 --> 26:46.891
and you've got the option then

26:46.968 --> 26:48.091
to continue your run,

26:48.177 --> 26:49.472
or you make the pass,

26:49.525 --> 26:51.663
depending on what's gonna be
more efficient for you, all right?

26:52.347 --> 26:54.763
All right, I'm gonna do down
about 15, cut across.

26:55.395 --> 26:56.041
You good?

26:56.437 --> 26:57.080
On two.

26:57.325 --> 26:58.051
Hut--hut!

26:59.867 --> 27:00.693
Watch this, hon.

27:01.067 --> 27:01.671
Here.

27:08.377 --> 27:09.570
All right, that's pretty good.

27:09.756 --> 27:11.121
- I gotta admit--
- Pretty good?

27:11.257 --> 27:12.163
That's a very good throw.

27:12.248 --> 27:14.080
All right, listen, I want you
to bean me with this

27:14.396 --> 27:15.570
as I make it for the house.

27:15.997 --> 27:16.742
You ready?

27:16.988 --> 27:17.683
On two.

27:18.185 --> 27:19.013
Hut, hut!

27:25.335 --> 27:27.593
No matter what happens today,

27:28.026 --> 27:29.780
we're all gonna be winners.

27:29.788 --> 27:30.580
Please.

27:30.637 --> 27:32.141
We will not accept a loss.

27:32.497 --> 27:33.781
We will not accept it.

27:34.198 --> 27:36.540
One...two...three...
Win!

27:36.555 --> 27:37.320
Let's go!

27:50.317 --> 27:51.471
Touchdown!

27:55.708 --> 27:57.220
Great job, ladies.

28:11.907 --> 28:13.161
Bring it on!

28:22.675 --> 28:24.221
Blue 42.

28:37.636 --> 28:38.953
This is supposed to be fun.

28:39.048 --> 28:40.190
Oh, honey, this is fun.

28:40.198 --> 28:41.253
This still
about Riggins, because--

28:41.255 --> 28:42.421
Oh, please,
not even close.

28:42.455 --> 28:44.351
- What is your problem?
- My problem?

28:44.987 --> 28:47.303
My problem is your dad,
Buddy Garrity,

28:47.437 --> 28:48.433
and him having his dirty hands

28:48.466 --> 28:50.013
all over my mom, his employee.

28:50.167 --> 28:51.323
What are you talking about?

28:53.486 --> 28:55.323
You know what?
You are just a spoiled little snob.

28:55.947 --> 28:58.212
You're not gonna
win this game.

29:03.566 --> 29:04.990
Come on, throw it!

29:04.996 --> 29:06.112
You wanna throw it!

29:11.288 --> 29:12.521
She got the ball off.

29:12.576 --> 29:13.431
That's a sack.

29:13.436 --> 29:15.342
What the hell
kinda call is that?

29:15.726 --> 29:16.892
Son, you're blind.

29:16.945 --> 29:18.383
- Honey.
- What?

29:18.547 --> 29:20.391
- Calm down.
- Excuse me.

29:20.816 --> 29:22.052
Stay off of my line.

29:22.086 --> 29:23.441
- What'd you say to me?
- My line.

29:23.708 --> 29:25.461
Right there, that line.

29:25.467 --> 29:26.961
That one right there
that's mine.

29:27.556 --> 29:28.393
Excuse me.

29:28.666 --> 29:29.622
Excuse me.

29:29.868 --> 29:31.072
That's your first one.

29:34.156 --> 29:35.691
This is it.
This is our last chance.

29:35.727 --> 29:37.240
We can either
go home with a tie.

29:37.336 --> 29:38.540
Or we can go home
with a win.

29:38.547 --> 29:42.043
How 'bout we run the 25-right
sprint option?

29:45.297 --> 29:46.213
Hut!

29:52.588 --> 29:53.731
Get her

29:54.265 --> 29:55.532
Kick her knees!

29:55.656 --> 29:56.931
Kick her knees!

30:00.166 --> 30:01.843
Keep runnin'.
Keep runnin'.

30:02.106 --> 30:03.483
That a girl!

30:03.575 --> 30:04.652
Keep runnin'!

30:12.295 --> 30:13.441
We won!

30:24.235 --> 30:25.220
Good game.

30:25.225 --> 30:26.252
Good game.

30:39.416 --> 30:40.261
Are you kidding me?

30:40.967 --> 30:42.580
What's crack-a-lacka, y'all?

30:42.588 --> 30:43.593
What's happening?

30:43.886 --> 30:45.512
Eric didn't tell me
you guys were gonna be out here.

30:45.525 --> 30:46.972
What's the occasion,
how you guys doin'?

30:46.995 --> 30:48.143
Surprise!

30:49.408 --> 30:50.481
It's not my birthday.

30:50.566 --> 30:53.312
We know it's not your birthday,
but we are here for a reason, QB.

30:53.506 --> 30:54.931
And that reason is...

30:56.087 --> 30:59.270
As a designated member of
the National Quad Rugby Squad,

30:59.397 --> 31:02.323
I am here to inform you that
you have been invited

31:02.505 --> 31:04.491
to training camp in Austin.

31:06.616 --> 31:07.682
No way.

31:09.316 --> 31:10.283
No way.

31:10.707 --> 31:12.721
Whoa, don't get so excited
there, young buck.

31:12.986 --> 31:13.972
Training camp

31:14.387 --> 31:15.440
is two weeks

31:15.588 --> 31:17.482
of the most intense,

31:17.857 --> 31:19.413
painful, exhausting

31:19.446 --> 31:21.690
workouts of your young,
wheelchair-bound life.

31:21.846 --> 31:23.220
And at the end
of that two weeks,

31:24.267 --> 31:25.893
coaches evaluate the players.

31:26.465 --> 31:27.871
Then choose the new members

31:28.376 --> 31:30.262
for the National
Quad Rugby Squad

31:30.475 --> 31:32.270
for the U.S. of A.

31:33.385 --> 31:35.042
I--I don't know what to say.
I mean,

31:35.095 --> 31:36.091
you think I got a shot?

31:36.605 --> 31:37.412
Uhh...no.

31:37.858 --> 31:39.521
Like a snowball's chance in...

31:40.355 --> 31:42.300
But, I'll tell you what,
we got four open spots.

31:42.836 --> 31:44.000
You make one of 'em,

31:44.218 --> 31:45.600
we're Beijing-bound.

31:46.126 --> 31:47.580
- That's China.
- That is China.

31:47.596 --> 31:49.820
Can you say chopsticks
and hot chicks?

31:50.066 --> 31:51.191
Yes, I can.

31:51.486 --> 31:52.730
Yes, I can.

31:52.888 --> 31:55.200
But now, you said
my credit score was fine.

31:55.245 --> 31:56.511
I'm sorry, Ms. Williams.

31:56.548 --> 31:59.570
But I did tell you a pre-approved loan
isn't always guaranteed.

31:59.668 --> 32:01.271
Oh, yeah, it wouldn't have
anything to do

32:01.287 --> 32:02.782
with me being single parent

32:02.796 --> 32:04.611
or that little box
on the application

32:04.618 --> 32:06.630
where you had me
to check off my race.

32:06.777 --> 32:07.873
No, no, that's

32:07.916 --> 32:09.042
federal monitoring

32:09.127 --> 32:10.631
to prevent racial bias.

32:10.817 --> 32:12.782
Oh, it worked like a charm,
didn't it?

32:12.807 --> 32:14.240
We want to talk
to your supervisor.

32:14.607 --> 32:16.051
It won't make a difference.

32:16.728 --> 32:18.041
Well, let's do it anyway.

32:19.595 --> 32:20.981
I can leave him a message.

32:21.576 --> 32:23.800
- We're here right now.
- I'm sorry, it's not possible.

32:23.895 --> 32:25.160
Let's go, Brian.

32:25.327 --> 32:26.800
No, Mama, they can't do this.

32:26.997 --> 32:28.401
They can't just
take back the loan.

32:28.407 --> 32:29.380
Oh, there will be other loans.

32:29.455 --> 32:31.443
No, we want to talk
to your boss now!

32:32.436 --> 32:34.163
It's not gonna do anybody
any good to get crazy.

32:34.167 --> 32:35.261
Look around you.

32:35.926 --> 32:37.453
Look at all these eyes on you.

32:38.225 --> 32:39.160
Lookin' at you.

32:39.296 --> 32:39.902
Waitin'.

32:40.117 --> 32:41.971
Expecting you
to do something violent.

32:42.075 --> 32:45.190
Become that junkyard dog
of Mac McGill's, uh-uh.

32:46.078 --> 32:47.300
Don't give 'em that.

32:48.036 --> 32:49.772
You ladies
have a good afternoon.

32:53.788 --> 32:55.023
Thank you very much.

33:06.947 --> 33:08.051
- Hey.
- Hey.

33:08.165 --> 33:09.482
How's my QB one?

33:09.867 --> 33:10.792
Hi.

33:11.546 --> 33:12.563
- How you doin'?
- Good.

33:12.587 --> 33:13.860
Can I ask you a question?

33:14.566 --> 33:15.641
Well the answer is "yes."

33:15.726 --> 33:17.821
You do look super-hot

33:17.828 --> 33:20.111
- in my football jersey.
- No, umm...

33:23.396 --> 33:25.111
Do you think
I'm a spoiled snob?

33:27.205 --> 33:28.851
- I'm serious.
- Where'd that come from?

33:28.915 --> 33:30.013
Answer the question.

33:34.865 --> 33:35.520
A little.

33:37.568 --> 33:39.690
A litt--I'm--
I'm kidding.

33:41.098 --> 33:42.563
Someone say something to you?

33:43.866 --> 33:45.330
Want me to go beat 'em up?

33:47.926 --> 33:49.181
Well, I gotta tell you
what happened to me today.

33:49.186 --> 33:50.941
- Yeah, I know--
- I got invited to Nationals.

33:51.507 --> 33:53.323
- What Nationals?
- Nationals. Quad Rugby

33:53.407 --> 33:54.300
National Team

33:54.317 --> 33:56.231
is having tryouts
in Austin for a couple of weeks

33:56.237 --> 33:57.582
- and they got four spots open.
- Austin?

33:57.638 --> 33:58.942
And if I go
and I make the team,

33:59.217 --> 34:01.323
then I'll possibly be going
to Beijing later this year.

34:02.475 --> 34:03.893
What does that mean?
What about--

34:04.176 --> 34:05.962
What about our plans?
What about school?

34:06.276 --> 34:07.640
School was a mistake.

34:09.326 --> 34:09.982
It wasn't--

34:10.106 --> 34:11.942
- School was a mistake?
- It's not--

34:12.507 --> 34:13.531
School's not a mistake.

34:13.588 --> 34:15.371
Fitting in was a mistake.

34:15.407 --> 34:17.482
- You fit in fine, Jason.
- No, I don't fit in fine.

34:17.487 --> 34:19.553
And even if I did fit in,
I don't want to.

34:19.598 --> 34:21.061
This is going backwards,
I wanna move forward.

34:21.138 --> 34:23.132
I wanna go later this month
and get my GED.

34:23.136 --> 34:24.563
- And bam, be done with school.
- Your GED?

34:24.567 --> 34:26.132
Yeah, my GED.
I'm this close.

34:26.255 --> 34:27.581
I'm this close, Lyla.

34:30.078 --> 34:31.853
Me going to Austin
for just a couple weeks

34:32.114 --> 34:33.262
doesn't change anything.

34:35.996 --> 34:38.262
We're just here to--
to have an opportunity

34:38.264 --> 34:40.001
to talk about race relations

34:40.018 --> 34:42.393
at this school and what's been
going on this week,

34:42.594 --> 34:44.293
and air your feelings, and

34:44.597 --> 34:45.681
and have people listen to you.

34:45.755 --> 34:46.982
So who wants to go first?

34:47.118 --> 34:47.842
Ms. Tami.

34:48.146 --> 34:48.672
Anton.

34:48.697 --> 34:49.733
I got something to say.

34:50.435 --> 34:51.492
I mean,

34:51.655 --> 34:54.833
when it comes to,
like, whites and blacks,

34:55.315 --> 34:57.063
man, we just--
we just different.

34:57.148 --> 34:58.563
That's a gross generalization.

34:58.606 --> 35:00.050
Dog, no, it's not, fool.

35:00.125 --> 35:01.720
Stereotypes happen
for a reason.

35:01.726 --> 35:03.153
Hey, this is not a debate.

35:03.188 --> 35:04.311
Just so we're clear.

35:04.446 --> 35:06.421
This is just a chance
for everybody to talk

35:06.527 --> 35:07.461
and listen.

35:07.578 --> 35:08.741
So if you wanna speak,

35:08.746 --> 35:10.873
you can hold up your hand.
Let's let Anton finish.

35:11.036 --> 35:12.010
Like I was saying,

35:12.237 --> 35:13.722
if you look at who's with who,

35:13.766 --> 35:15.010
you know, in the lunch room

35:15.156 --> 35:16.951
or, you know what I'm saying,
after school.

35:17.396 --> 35:18.932
At the end of the day,

35:19.337 --> 35:20.610
we just naturally

35:20.786 --> 35:21.650
go with our own.

35:22.245 --> 35:24.082
I mean, that's just how it is.
I mean, that's all I'm saying.

35:24.086 --> 35:25.651
All right.
All right.

35:26.147 --> 35:27.182
Landry.

35:28.168 --> 35:29.561
I mean, I think a lot of it has

35:29.565 --> 35:30.982
to do with how we're socialized.

35:31.176 --> 35:32.981
If that makes any sense.
I mean, um

35:33.175 --> 35:34.512
science says that my DNA

35:34.517 --> 35:36.050
could be closer to that of a

35:36.055 --> 35:37.593
black person in Kenya

35:37.885 --> 35:39.281
I suppose that

35:39.396 --> 35:41.230
I don't know, the white
person sitting next to me.

35:41.446 --> 35:42.771
That's interesting.

35:43.547 --> 35:44.362
Waverly.

35:44.776 --> 35:45.770
Let's face it, you guys,

35:45.786 --> 35:47.502
people say things like Mac said

35:47.715 --> 35:49.271
all the time and worse.

35:49.665 --> 35:51.190
But the real problem is

35:51.476 --> 35:53.160
people just refuse
to acknowledge that racism

35:53.168 --> 35:54.431
even exists in Dillon.

35:54.536 --> 35:56.151
So we need to have more
forums like this,

35:56.157 --> 35:57.470
- we need to talk about it.
- Don't get your panties in a wad, Waverly.

35:57.478 --> 35:59.420
It's not like this is
a big conspiracy.

36:00.345 --> 36:01.521
It is not like being white

36:01.527 --> 36:03.010
gives you the right
to interrupt either.

36:03.015 --> 36:03.431
Thank you.

36:03.435 --> 36:04.791
And it's not like we're
at a movie theater.

36:04.796 --> 36:05.253
Hey, hey, hey,

36:05.258 --> 36:06.372
quiet down, y'all.

36:06.378 --> 36:07.523
Man, what you trying to say,
Thompson?

36:07.527 --> 36:08.433
He's trying to say
that I can't even

36:08.438 --> 36:09.081
go to a movie anymore

36:09.086 --> 36:10.302
to a decent movie
without some black person

36:10.308 --> 36:11.933
in front of me yelling
and talking all the time.

36:11.935 --> 36:12.931
Sit down, please.

36:13.777 --> 36:17.113
Why don't you keep your dumbass,
ignorant, racist comments--

36:17.147 --> 36:18.901
Guys! Guys!
Stop it!

36:20.266 --> 36:21.952
Guys! Guys!
Stop it!

36:39.748 --> 36:40.783
Hey, Mac

36:41.507 --> 36:42.862
What you're doing
here so late?

36:43.337 --> 36:44.953
We never got a chance to talk.

36:45.258 --> 36:46.052
About what?

36:46.376 --> 36:47.842
Well, about what you said,

36:48.085 --> 36:50.013
and how you may or may not
perceive the black players--

36:50.025 --> 36:51.230
What I perceive

36:51.438 --> 36:52.553
other than football

36:52.676 --> 36:53.732
is none of your business.

36:53.925 --> 36:55.993
Whoa, look, I'm just trying
to have a dialogue.

36:56.226 --> 36:58.211
Well, you save your dialoguin'
for your mommy.

36:58.678 --> 37:00.003
Now, wait a minute,
you said--

37:00.008 --> 37:01.191
No, you wait a minute, son.

37:01.507 --> 37:02.721
You wait just a minute.

37:03.447 --> 37:05.081
I've been here
for 27 years.

37:05.458 --> 37:07.810
And I am not about
to be interrogated by some

37:07.916 --> 37:09.961
too-big-for-his-britches
teenager, you got me?

37:10.078 --> 37:11.982
What the hell you mean,
too-big-for-my-britches, Mac?

37:12.216 --> 37:12.822
You don't wanna see--

37:12.827 --> 37:14.242
This is done, all right?
This is over.

37:14.588 --> 37:16.301
I'm done with this.
I am done.

37:16.455 --> 37:17.262
Look,

37:17.876 --> 37:19.160
if I hear you whining,

37:19.285 --> 37:21.603
or anybody else whining
about this anymore,

37:21.997 --> 37:23.882
you're gonna be warming your ass
on the bench Friday night,

37:23.887 --> 37:25.512
- you got me?
- Oh, no, you can't do that.

37:25.516 --> 37:26.701
Oh, I can.

37:27.106 --> 37:27.771
Yeah.

37:28.195 --> 37:29.703
And I will.

37:35.528 --> 37:36.862
I'm tired of this crap.

37:48.056 --> 37:48.861
Hey, babe.

37:50.186 --> 37:51.252
Hey.

38:08.388 --> 38:10.952
Well, it didn't go very well,
honey.

38:17.307 --> 38:19.840
I mean, first of all,
hardly anybody showed up.

38:23.168 --> 38:24.750
But then, I mean,
I wish you could--

38:26.347 --> 38:29.012
I wish you coulda seen the way
these kids were yelling at each other.

38:30.437 --> 38:32.581
Calling each other names.

38:39.098 --> 38:41.142
It's real hard
to make a change around here.

38:46.956 --> 38:50.130
You know you're an example
to aspire to, don't you?

38:52.408 --> 38:54.811
You gave them an opportunity
to express themselves

38:54.817 --> 38:57.273
that they wouldn't have
otherwise, you know that.

38:57.495 --> 38:59.953
Because you're always there
ready to listen to them.

39:02.425 --> 39:05.152
You never shy away
from difficult subjects.

39:05.808 --> 39:07.752
They know they can trust you.

39:11.025 --> 39:12.283
That's a rarity.

39:21.506 --> 39:23.361
You're my wife,

39:23.537 --> 39:25.520
and I am damn proud of you.

39:25.827 --> 39:26.801
Come here.

39:26.966 --> 39:29.233
Oh, come here, come here,
come here, come here.

40:43.947 --> 40:45.172
Hey, Smash.

40:45.706 --> 40:46.702
Matt.

40:47.055 --> 40:48.000
So, I--

40:48.247 --> 40:49.932
I heard that forum
was kinda crazy.

40:50.218 --> 40:51.162
I heard.

40:51.576 --> 40:53.003
Look, I was thinking
that maybe we should

40:53.015 --> 40:54.353
- get the team together--
- No disrespect,

40:54.417 --> 40:56.141
but I'm really not in the mood
for chatting right now.

40:57.836 --> 40:59.422
Let's go, gentlemen.
Let's go.

40:59.808 --> 41:02.083
Got a lot of work to do today.
A lot of work.

41:02.675 --> 41:04.052
Everybody feelin' good today?

41:04.467 --> 41:05.580
I can't hear you.

41:05.878 --> 41:08.032
All right, I like to hear that.
Mac, let's call it.

41:08.267 --> 41:10.430
All right, you heard the man.
Let's go, get on the line.

41:10.825 --> 41:12.040
Stride it out.

41:13.626 --> 41:14.720
On my whistle.

41:28.077 --> 41:30.663
You boys deaf or something?
I said on my whistle!

41:30.727 --> 41:31.733
Ready!

41:40.898 --> 41:42.662
I'm not gonna tell you again.

41:43.138 --> 41:45.662
Get your asses down there.
On my whistle!
