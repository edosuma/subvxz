USE THIS TRANSFORMATION MACHINE?

09:58.966 --> 10:01.499
THIS WAS SUPPOSED
TO BE A BLUE COLLAR<i> COSBY SHOW.</i>

10:01.501 --> 10:03.969
NOW YOU'RE TURNING IT
INTO GODDAMN<i> QUANTUM LEAP.</i>

10:03.971 --> 10:04.736
WHO WRITES THIS [bleep]?

10:04.738 --> 10:07.272
- OKAY, I COULDN'T TELL YOU
EVEN IF I WANTED TO, OKAY, MAN?

10:07.274 --> 10:09.007
WE GOT, LIKE,
21 WRITERS UP THERE, OKAY?

10:09.009 --> 10:10.041
KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING,
REGINALD?

10:10.043 --> 10:12.143
BUT YOU AND I BOTH KNOW
THAT THEY DON'T DECIDE

10:12.145 --> 10:13.044
WHAT HAPPENS IN THIS SHOW, OKAY?

10:13.046 --> 10:14.779
WE BOTH KNOW WHO DECIDES
WHAT HAPPENS IN THE SHOW.

10:14.781 --> 10:18.416
- TWO WEEKS AGO STEVE URKEL USED
HIS INVISIBILITY RAY ON CARL

10:18.418 --> 10:20.518
AND I WASN'T
EVEN IN THE GODDAMN EPISODE.

10:20.520 --> 10:22.153
IT WAS JUST MY VOICE.
- YES, I KNOW.

10:22.155 --> 10:23.154
I KNOW, REGINALD.
I'M SORRY.

10:23.156 --> 10:25.023
I [bleep] APOLOGIZE.
IT'LL NEVER HAPPEN AGAIN.

10:25.025 --> 10:27.559
- THEN STEVE USED HIS
VOICE-CHANGING RAY TO TURN CARL

10:27.561 --> 10:28.994
INTO A HIGH-PITCHED,
NERDY VOICE.

10:28.996 --> 10:30.829
WHO DO YOU THINK
PROVIDED THE VOICE FOR THAT?

10:30.831 --> 10:33.098
- DON'T GET TOO FEISTY
ON ME NOW, REG.

10:33.100 --> 10:34.399
LET'S NOT GO DOWN THAT PATH,
OKAY?

10:34.401 --> 10:36.835
- OH, OH, WE ARE GOING
DOWN THAT PATH, GENE.

10:36.837 --> 10:41.006
IN A COUPLE OF WEEKS,
HARRIET, EDDIE, LAURA, GRANDMA,

10:41.008 --> 10:43.775
AUNT RACHEL, LITTLE RICHIE,
AND THE OTHER LITTLE KID

10:43.777 --> 10:46.077
ARE GONNA GET TELEPORTED
TO ANOTHER DIMENSION,

10:46.079 --> 10:48.780
AND THEN STEVE INJECTS CARL
WITH HIS OWN DNA,

10:48.782 --> 10:50.982
SO CARL
TURNS INTO ANOTHER STEVE URKEL.

10:50.984 --> 10:53.018
THAT'S TWO STEVE URKELS
AND NO FAMILY

10:53.020 --> 10:54.252
ON A SHOW CALLED<i> FAMILY MATTERS.</i>

10:54.254 --> 10:55.253
HOW THE [bleep] DOES THAT WORK?

10:55.255 --> 10:57.222
- LISTEN, LISTEN, REGINALD.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO TELL YOU.

10:57.224 --> 10:59.658
URKEL MANIA IS UNSTOPPABLE,
OKAY?

10:59.660 --> 11:00.392
HE'S A PHENOMENON.

11:00.394 --> 11:02.494
THERE'S NOTHING
WE CAN DO ABOUT IT, OKAY?

11:02.496 --> 11:04.162
IT'S UP TO S--

11:04.164 --> 11:04.863
HIM.

11:04.865 --> 11:06.798
- NO, NO, NO, NO, NO!

11:06.800 --> 11:09.334
I'M AN ACTOR.
I'M A [bleep] ACTOR.

11:09.336 --> 11:10.969
I AM A REAL ACTOR.

11:10.971 --> 11:11.803
I DID<i> RICHARD III.</i>

11:11.805 --> 11:14.105
I WAS IN<i> TRUE WEST</i>
WITH SHERMAN HEMSLEY.

11:14.107 --> 11:15.907
I WAS IN<i> DIE HARD,</i> DAMN IT.

11:15.909 --> 11:17.242
[bleep] STEVE URKEL!

11:17.244 --> 11:18.543
- [bleep]--
YOU WILL SUCK

11:18.545 --> 11:19.978
STEVE URKEL'S [bleep]
IF HE WANTS YOU TO!

11:19.980 --> 11:22.280
YOU WILL SUCK HIS [bleep]
[bleep], DO YOU UNDERSTAND?

11:22.282 --> 11:25.116
HE IS OUR BREAD AND BUTTER,
YOU MOTHER[bleep]!

11:25.118 --> 11:26.351
I AM HIGH ON COCAINE!

11:26.353 --> 11:27.485
- I'M A [bleep] ACTOR, GENE!

11:27.487 --> 11:29.888
I DONE MORE COCAINE
THAN YOU WEIGH, MOTHER[bleep]!

11:29.890 --> 11:32.557
- I'M GONNA TELL YOU WHAT YOU
ARE, REGINALD VELJOHNSON.

11:32.559 --> 11:37.028
YOU'RE A [bleep] PAWN
IN THAT NERD'S GAME.

11:37.030 --> 11:38.730
YOU ARE A [bleep] PAWN!

11:38.732 --> 11:42.767
DO YOU THINK I HAVE ANY POWER
OVER WHAT THAT MONSTER DOES?

11:42.769 --> 11:44.035
ANY POWER AT ALL?

11:44.037 --> 11:45.503
- AHH!

11:45.505 --> 11:49.441
- I AM THE SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT
OF DEVELOPMENT

11:49.443 --> 11:52.544
FOR THE AMERICAN BRO--

11:52.546 --> 11:56.314
- GENE?
GENE?

11:56.316 --> 12:01.519
GENE, WHAT'S BECOME OF YOU,
GENE?

12:01.521 --> 12:05.790
- I AM NOTHING.

12:05.792 --> 12:08.126
- GENE, I DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU MEAN BY THAT, GENE,

12:08.128 --> 12:09.094
BUT YOU'RE SCARING ME.

12:09.096 --> 12:11.396
OH, NO, DON'T, DON'T,
DON'T DO ANYTHING CRAZY, GENE.

12:11.398 --> 12:12.630
EVERYONE DOES TOO MUCH COKE
SOMETIMES,

12:12.632 --> 12:14.999
BUT DO THE--JUST, WHAT ARE YOU
GONNA DO WITH THE GUN, GENE?

12:15.001 --> 12:17.869
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO?
DON'T--NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.

12:17.871 --> 12:20.305
WE CAN TALK THIS THROUGH.

12:20.307 --> 12:21.506
OKAY?

12:21.508 --> 12:24.409
- THE KING IS DEAD.

12:24.411 --> 12:25.910
LONG LIVE THE KING.

12:25.912 --> 12:29.948
- NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO!

12:35.855 --> 12:38.723
- DID I DO THAT?

12:45.531 --> 12:47.699
- JALEEL.
- JALEEL?

12:47.701 --> 12:49.768
THERE IS NO JALEEL.

12:49.770 --> 12:51.669
ONLY STEVE.

12:51.671 --> 12:53.505
IT'S ALWAYS BEEN STEVE.

12:53.507 --> 12:59.310
- YIPPIE KI-YAY, MOTHER[bleep]!
[gun clicking]

12:59.312 --> 13:02.013
- FORGETTING SOMETHING, CARL?

13:02.015 --> 13:03.081
- DON'T YOU COME NEAR ME.

13:03.083 --> 13:04.582
STAY AWAY FROM ME, YOU HEAR?

13:04.584 --> 13:08.586
- COULD HAVE ALL BEEN SO SIMPLE,
CARL.

13:08.588 --> 13:10.622
JUST SAY YOUR LINES

13:10.624 --> 13:12.757
AND TAKE THE MONEY.

13:12.759 --> 13:14.893
- YOU'RE A MONSTER.

13:18.430 --> 13:19.898
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

13:19.900 --> 13:22.600
I, I, I, I CAN'T CONTROL--

13:22.602 --> 13:24.602
- AM I DOING THIS?

13:24.604 --> 13:25.703
- NO, NO, NO,

13:25.705 --> 13:26.805
NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.

13:26.807 --> 13:28.439
STEVE, I'LL DO ANYTHING.

13:28.441 --> 13:32.010
- YOU WILL DO
WHAT I WANT ON<i> FAMILY MATTERS.</i>

13:32.012 --> 13:35.480
- YES, YES.

13:35.482 --> 13:37.582
OF COURSE, STEVE.

13:41.921 --> 13:45.623
- SEE YOU ON SET, CARL.

13:48.260 --> 13:53.565
- GET OUT OF MY HOUSE, STEVE!

14:02.141 --> 14:04.509
- YOU LIKE YOUR WINES.

14:04.511 --> 14:06.177
- YOU LIKE YOUR WINES.
- I DO LIKE LIQUOR.

14:06.179 --> 14:07.278

14:07.280 --> 14:08.980
TO SEE YOU AT A PARTY
WITH THE BEER SITUATION.

14:08.982 --> 14:10.181
I LIKE IT A LOT.
- MM-HMM.

14:10.183 --> 14:12.617

14:12.619 --> 14:14.552
MAYBE THE SNIFFLES.
GET THE--

14:14.554 --> 14:15.453

14:15.455 --> 14:16.487
OF EXPERIENCES.
- WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.

14:16.489 --> 14:17.822
SHOW ME AGAIN.
WHAT IS--HOW DO YOU DRINK WINE?

14:17.824 --> 14:19.357
- YOU WANT TO AERATE IT.
WANT TO--YOU WANT TO SWIRL IT

14:19.359 --> 14:20.859
AROUND IN THE GLASS.
LET THE OXYGEN GO IN THERE.

14:20.861 --> 14:22.293
- YEAH, YEAH, LET THE OXYGEN IN.
- AND YOU'RE GONNA GIVE IT

14:22.295 --> 14:25.396
A LITTLE--CHECK THAT BOUQUET.
YOU CAN GET CHERRIES IN THERE,

14:25.398 --> 14:27.432
ASHTRAY, GASOLINE...

14:27.434 --> 14:29.434
- STRAWBERRIES, HAIRS--
- I'M SORRY, BACK IT UP.

14:29.436 --> 14:31.703
DID YOU SAY ASHTRAY?
- ASHTRAY, GASOLINE,

14:31.705 --> 14:33.638
ASHTRAY, GASOLINE...
- DISGUSTING.

14:33.640 --> 14:34.739
- WIDE OPEN ASS...
- I'M PRETTY SURE--

14:34.741 --> 14:36.040
- SOMETIMES YOU
GET THOSE SMELLS IN THERE.

14:36.042 --> 14:38.276
AND YOU'RE JUST GOING, "MMM."
NOW THAT ISN'T--

14:38.278 --> 14:39.277
THAT DOESN'T PRECLUDE THE TASTE.

14:39.279 --> 14:41.012
THE TASTE MAY BE GOOD, STILL.
- BUT THEN, DUDE, THAT'S--

14:41.014 --> 14:43.314
WHEN YOU SIP IT, THEN YOU--
- THEN YOU SIP IT.

14:43.316 --> 14:45.216
THEN YOU GO--

14:45.218 --> 14:46.618
'CAUSE YOU WANT THE AIR--

14:46.620 --> 14:47.585
I JUST PUT THE GLASS DOWN.

14:47.587 --> 14:49.687
- WHY DID YOU PUT THE GLASS--
BUT THAT'S NOT A REAL GLASS.

14:49.689 --> 14:52.290
- YOU WANT TO--
YOU WANT TO PUT AIR--

14:52.292 --> 14:53.491
SUCK IN AIR OVER THE WINE

14:53.493 --> 14:55.226
WHILE THE WINE
IS RESTING ON YOUR TONGUE.

14:55.228 --> 14:57.228
- BUT YOU LOOK--
YOU LOOK LIKE AN IDIOT.

14:57.230 --> 14:58.696
- I KNOW, MAN.

15:01.667 --> 15:03.268
- THIS PLACE IS SO NICE.

15:03.270 --> 15:07.972

THE BEST FRENCH PLACES IN TOWN.

15:07.974 --> 15:13.344
- MM, I DID NOT REALIZE
THAT YOU WERE SO CULTURED.

15:13.346 --> 15:15.079

YOU ALREADY MESSED THINGS UP.

18:32.579 --> 18:34.912
OH, NO,

18:34.914 --> 18:37.515
HE'S NOT GOING TO KNOW
WHETHER TO ANSWER IT OR NOT.

18:37.517 --> 18:39.450

THAT'S--THAT'S GOOD.

18:39.452 --> 18:41.385

OH, THAT'S PERMANENT.

18:46.392 --> 18:48.459
THAT'S A PERMANENT
SILLY MUSTACHE.

18:48.461 --> 18:51.462
AH, NOW HE LOOKS LIKE
A SLEEPING MUSKETEER.

18:51.464 --> 18:54.232
THAT'S ADORABLE,
BUT IT'S RIDICULOUS.

18:54.234 --> 18:56.701
HE CAN'T--
HE CAN HARDLY WASH THAT OFF.

18:56.703 --> 18:58.669
WELL, THAT'S--WHERE YOU GOING?

18:58.671 --> 19:00.438
WHAT IS THAT?
NOW WITH THE--

19:00.440 --> 19:01.172
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

19:01.174 --> 19:02.507
WHAT ARE YOU PUTTING IN
HIS HAND?

19:02.509 --> 19:04.008
THAT DOESN'T EVEN
MAKE SENSE HERE.

19:04.010 --> 19:05.676
THAT DOESN'T EVEN MAKE SENSE.

19:05.678 --> 19:07.078
OH, OH, ANTHONY!

19:07.080 --> 19:10.248
OH, THAT'S HILARIOUS, BUT SAVE
THAT FOR A SLUMBER PARTY.

19:10.250 --> 19:11.582
ALL RIGHT,
WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO?

19:11.584 --> 19:13.618
OH, YOU'RE REARRANGING
THE SILVERWARE.

19:13.620 --> 19:15.786
THAT'S JUST SO MEAN.
THAT'S--IT'S CONFUSING.

19:15.788 --> 19:17.522
IT'S CONFUSING ENOUGH,
WHAT WITH THE--

19:17.524 --> 19:19.190
ANTHONY.
ANTHONY, DON'T DO IT.

19:19.192 --> 19:21.926
OH, WELL, YOU KNOW, THE SALAD
NEEDED A LITTLE PEPPER,

19:21.928 --> 19:24.262
SO THAT'S GOOD.
SO THAT'S--THAT'S NOT SO BAD.

19:24.264 --> 19:26.264
YOU FINALLY DID
SOMETHING CONSTRUCTIVE.

19:26.266 --> 19:27.965
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
WHAT ARE YOU--OKAY.

19:27.967 --> 19:29.300
YOU'RE PUTTING
THE SILVERWARE BACK.

19:29.302 --> 19:31.035
THAT'S GOOD.
WELL, THAT'S ALL--THAT'S GOOD.

19:31.037 --> 19:33.271
NOW HE KNOWS HE CAN GO
FROM OUTSIDE TO INSIDE.

19:33.273 --> 19:36.707
THAT'S--OH, YOU'RE PUTTING
A LITTLE<i> JUS</i> IN HIS HAIR.

19:36.709 --> 19:38.042
THAT'S GOOD, YEAH, JUS IT.

19:38.044 --> 19:38.943
JUS IT--OH, NOW, WELL, THAT--

19:38.945 --> 19:40.845
IT ACTUALLY LOOKS BETTER
THAN WHEN HE CAME IN.

19:40.847 --> 19:44.148
IF HE WASN'T UNCONSCIOUS
HE COULD GO OUT ON THE TOWN,

19:44.150 --> 19:45.183
SO THAT'S GOOD.
THAT'S GOOD.

19:45.185 --> 19:48.953
OH, OKAY, YOU GOT--ALL RIGHT,
WIPE OFF--WIPE OFF HIS FACE.

19:48.955 --> 19:51.489
YEAH, YEAH, AND GET THE MUSTACHE
WHILE YOU'RE AT IT,

19:51.491 --> 19:53.324
'CAUSE THAT'S THE MOST
EMBARRASSING PART.

19:53.326 --> 19:55.193
AH, HE DOESN'T LOOK RIDICULOUS
ANYMORE.

19:55.195 --> 19:57.028
OH, OKAY, YEAH, THAT'S, THAT'S--

19:57.030 --> 19:58.029
NOW YOU'RE HELPING EVERYBODY.

19:58.031 --> 20:00.264
THAT'S GOOD FOR EVERYBODY.
EVERYBODY LIKES THAT.

20:00.266 --> 20:01.966
NOBODY WANTS LETTUCE
ON THE FLOOR.

20:01.968 --> 20:03.568
- SPICK-AND-[bleep]-SPAN.

20:03.570 --> 20:04.402
- ALL RIGHT, WE DONE?

20:04.404 --> 20:06.537
ALL RIGHT,
YOU REALLY TURNED THIS AROUND.

20:06.539 --> 20:08.539
THERE HE--ALL RIGHT,
AND THEN YOU'RE GONE, THEN.

20:08.541 --> 20:12.109
ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT,
HE WON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT HIT HIM.

20:12.111 --> 20:15.546
HE WON'T EVEN KNOW
THAT ANY--

20:15.548 --> 20:16.948
OH, NO.

20:16.950 --> 20:18.316
NO, NO, NO, NO.

20:18.318 --> 20:18.816
ANTHONY.

20:18.818 --> 20:20.918
ANTHONY,
I CAN SEE IT IN YOUR EYES.

20:20.920 --> 20:21.852
I CAN SEE IT IN YOUR EYES.

20:21.854 --> 20:23.921
YOU'RE GOING THE OTHER WAY NOW,
ANTHONY.

20:23.923 --> 20:25.623
ANTHONY, IT WAS GOING SO WELL.

20:25.625 --> 20:26.490
WELL THAT'S--THAT'S--

20:26.492 --> 20:29.026
THAT'S PERVERSE, ANTHONY.
I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT THAT IS.

20:29.028 --> 20:30.795
THAT--WHAT'S THAT?
WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO

20:30.797 --> 20:32.630
WITH THAT FINGER?
WHAT ARE DOING--OH!

20:32.632 --> 20:34.565
YEAH, NO.
NOT A WET WILLY.

20:34.567 --> 20:37.368
NO!
NO, ANTHONY.

20:37.370 --> 20:39.437
OH, WE'RE GOING TO WAR, ANTHONY.

20:39.439 --> 20:41.005
WE'RE GOING TO WAR.

20:41.007 --> 20:42.940
WE'RE GOING TO WAR.

20:44.276 --> 20:46.377
- CAN YOU IMAGINE
IF WE HAD TO HUNT?

20:46.379 --> 20:47.111
- OH, WE'D DIE.

20:47.113 --> 20:49.447
- WE WOULD DIE.
- WE WOULD STARVE TO DEATH.

20:49.449 --> 20:50.348
- WE WOULD--I MEAN MY--

20:50.350 --> 20:52.149
- IT'S NOT EVEN--
NO TWO DOUBTS ABOUT IT.

20:52.151 --> 20:56.354
- THESE MOTHER[bleep] SHOT
RABBITS WITH BOWS AND ARROWS.

20:56.356 --> 20:56.988
- MM-HMM.

20:56.990 --> 20:59.624
- [bleep], I CAN'T HIT
TOILET WATER WITH MY OWN PEE.

20:59.626 --> 21:02.093
- ♪ I'M GONNA DO
MY ONE LINE HERE ♪

21:02.095 --> 21:04.395
- OH, YEAH.

21:07.966 --> 21:09.767
- IT'S UP TO HIM.
- I JUST READ AN OUTLINE...

21:09.769 --> 21:11.002
- WHERE THE [bleep]
DID YOU GET IT?

21:11.004 --> 21:12.737
- WHERE CARL PUTS ON
A SCROOGE NIGHT GOWN,

21:12.739 --> 21:16.340
AND URKEL MISTAKES HIM FOR
A WOMAN AND TRIES TO SEDUCE HIM.

21:16.342 --> 21:18.442
IT'S NOT EVEN
A CHRISTMAS EPISODE, GENE.

21:18.444 --> 21:20.077
DAMN IT!
THAT'S NOT COMEDY!

21:20.079 --> 21:20.110
I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT THAT IS.
- HEY!
