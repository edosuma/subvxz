00:12.837 --> 00:15.938
Ah, I see you moved my desk
over by the window.

00:15.978 --> 00:17.878
Great. Now if I want to jump out,

00:17.913 --> 00:19.780
I don't have that long walk
across the office

00:19.815 --> 00:21.515
to change my mind.

00:23.566 --> 00:24.909
Yeah, I just thought

00:24.934 --> 00:26.320
for, you know, the time being,

00:26.355 --> 00:28.081
it'd be better if we don't
look at each other,

00:28.106 --> 00:30.613
you know, because of your lying eyes.

00:32.900 --> 00:35.266
I want you to know that
this is killing me, all right?

00:35.302 --> 00:37.736
I've been crying for the last 24 hours.

00:37.771 --> 00:39.923
Every time I think about
what I did, I feel sick.

00:40.049 --> 00:42.116
Oh, hey, look, I know
this is hard on you, too.

00:42.184 --> 00:43.985
Can I get you a cup of tea, an aspirin,

00:44.053 --> 00:47.470
maybe somebody to sleep with
behind my back?

00:50.026 --> 00:52.059
Tea sounds nice.

00:52.094 --> 00:54.128
I am not getting you tea!

00:55.865 --> 00:57.832
Look, this is really hard.

00:57.867 --> 00:59.934
I-I just don't know
what I'm supposed to do

01:00.003 --> 01:01.035
to make things better.

01:01.070 --> 01:02.469
You can't, okay?

01:02.505 --> 01:05.038
So, let's just focus on the work.

01:05.072 --> 01:07.340
- Great.
- Okay.

01:07.375 --> 01:10.243
Here. This needs to be rewritten.

01:10.278 --> 01:12.328
Wait. I turned this in last week.

01:12.353 --> 01:13.369
You said it was fine.

01:13.415 --> 01:14.544
Yeah, that was last week.

01:14.573 --> 01:16.226
But now it's lacking honesty, truth,

01:16.251 --> 01:18.818
integrity, morality, loyalty.

01:20.488 --> 01:22.956
All right, I think we have
two options here...

01:22.991 --> 01:24.791
you can either beat up on me all day

01:24.826 --> 01:26.626
or we can get some work done.

01:26.662 --> 01:29.429
Ooh, I'm an excellent multitasker.

01:32.868 --> 01:34.400
I'll just quit.

01:34.436 --> 01:35.565
Hey, you know what?

01:35.590 --> 01:39.104
I thought I was handling this
pretty well, okay?

01:39.173 --> 01:41.139
This guy... he got cheated on,

01:41.175 --> 01:43.976
threw his wife's prosthetic leg
in the Chicago River.

01:46.080 --> 01:47.947
Sure, but if you read further,

01:47.982 --> 01:49.782
you'll see that he forgave her,

01:49.850 --> 01:52.985
and now they're currently out
shopping for a new leg.

01:58.025 --> 01:59.524
Oh!

01:59.560 --> 02:01.060
Guess what I just saw!

02:01.095 --> 02:04.196
Better not be another baby
dressed as a Chicago dog.

02:05.532 --> 02:07.399
- This was a lot of work.
- Ohh.

02:07.434 --> 02:10.401
There's so much stuff on it,
you can barely taste the baby.

02:10.437 --> 02:11.369
Aww.

02:11.438 --> 02:13.171
No, I was walking past

02:13.207 --> 02:15.173
the Chinese place
that used to be the Lunch Box,

02:15.209 --> 02:17.142
and I saw a "for lease" sign
in the window.

02:17.177 --> 02:19.377
They're going out of business!

02:19.446 --> 02:21.179
Well, I'm happy you're finding joy

02:21.248 --> 02:23.915
in the fact that a nice family's dreams
have been crushed.

02:23.942 --> 02:26.463
Boy, did you need a win.

02:26.588 --> 02:29.687
The point is, the Lunch Box
is for lease.

02:29.723 --> 02:32.757
I mean, those were
the best years of my life.

02:32.792 --> 02:36.161
Would it be crazy to open it up again?

02:36.196 --> 02:37.996
Are you really considering that?

02:38.064 --> 02:39.163
Yeah, I've been searching for something

02:39.198 --> 02:40.444
that's gonna make me happy,

02:40.469 --> 02:42.313
and... bam! I saw the "for lease" sign,

02:42.367 --> 02:43.379
and it hit me.

02:43.430 --> 02:45.903
I've been looking
to the future for answers,

02:45.939 --> 02:49.206
but all my happiness is behind me.

02:51.310 --> 02:53.477
We all thought you knew.

02:55.248 --> 02:56.748
And it came to me

02:56.783 --> 02:58.883
that you've got all this
restaurant experience now,

02:58.918 --> 03:00.417
so you could help me run it.

03:00.453 --> 03:01.385
Seriously?

03:01.420 --> 03:03.420
Yeah. We would get
the whole family involved.

03:03.489 --> 03:06.024
That's what made it
so wonderful to begin with.

03:06.059 --> 03:08.259
We all got together,
and we had one purpose...

03:08.294 --> 03:11.194
to make Roseanne happy.

03:13.999 --> 03:17.600
And now it would be to make me happy.

03:18.871 --> 03:21.304
If it works, I could be my own boss.

03:21.339 --> 03:23.273
That would make things so much easier.

03:23.308 --> 03:25.408
You could bring Little Bev to work.

03:25.443 --> 03:27.110
Oh, my God, we could put her
on the hostess stand

03:27.146 --> 03:28.779
and make her the hostess.

03:30.661 --> 03:32.620
When a baby says
there's a 20-minute wait,

03:32.645 --> 03:34.060
you don't get mad. It's a baby.

03:36.221 --> 03:37.988
They'll be lined up around the block,

03:38.023 --> 03:41.423
everybody waiting to make me happy.

03:43.795 --> 03:45.728
You have enough money
to open a restaurant?

03:45.763 --> 03:47.429
Yeah, I got a chunk put away.

03:47.464 --> 03:49.165
I made a lot as a trucker,

03:49.200 --> 03:51.433
and then there's the money
I got from that settlement

03:51.468 --> 03:54.303
when my boob got stuck
in that elevator door.

03:56.908 --> 04:00.609
Well, we'll do
a deep dive on that later.

04:00.644 --> 04:03.112
Uh, but if I hear you correctly,

04:03.181 --> 04:04.589
you're gonna be putting in all the money

04:04.614 --> 04:06.481
- and taking all the risk.
- I am.

04:06.550 --> 04:08.302
- Well, I'm in!
- Oh! Good!

04:09.700 --> 04:11.965
- Aaaah!
- Whoo!

04:48.780 --> 04:49.873
<i>"The Conners" is filmed</i>

04:49.953 --> 04:52.208
<i>in front of a live studio audience.</i>

04:52.271 --> 04:54.662
Hey, you're home early.

04:54.697 --> 04:55.863
You can watch your own kids,

04:55.898 --> 04:58.165
and I can take some me time.

05:01.170 --> 05:03.237
I could read a book,

05:03.273 --> 05:05.373
write a letter to an old friend,

05:05.408 --> 05:06.540
or, better yet, drink beer

05:06.576 --> 05:09.343
and watch that video of
the monkey washing the cat.

05:12.582 --> 05:14.381
I had to get out of the office.

05:14.416 --> 05:16.549
It's really hard to be around Ben now.

05:16.585 --> 05:17.884
Why? What happened?

05:19.755 --> 05:21.655
I slept with David and Ben
at the same time.

05:21.723 --> 05:23.690
All together?

05:27.296 --> 05:28.495
No.

05:28.530 --> 05:29.729
Separately.

05:29.765 --> 05:30.697
Better.

05:30.732 --> 05:33.900
Still not good. What were you thinking?

05:33.935 --> 05:36.503
David wanted to get back together,

05:36.571 --> 05:37.870
and I didn't know who to pick.

05:37.939 --> 05:39.272
And then David dumped me.

05:39.308 --> 05:40.307
Ben found out about David.

05:40.342 --> 05:43.310
Then Ben dumped me, too,
and now Ben hates my guts.

05:43.345 --> 05:44.544
Aw, honey,

05:44.579 --> 05:46.379
of course he hates you.

05:48.183 --> 05:50.882
I-I knew it was wrong to play two guys,

05:50.918 --> 05:52.884
but I just couldn't
find a way out of it.

05:52.953 --> 05:54.219
It's so true what they say...

05:54.288 --> 05:56.322
it's hard out here for a pimp.

06:01.495 --> 06:02.928
Yeah, this is a tough one.

06:02.963 --> 06:04.963
You may not be able to fix this.

06:04.998 --> 06:06.365
Please don't say that.

06:06.434 --> 06:08.434
I love Ben. I have to fix this.

06:08.469 --> 06:09.968
Oh, I'm sure he still loves you.

06:10.003 --> 06:12.404
You don't get over that overnight.

06:12.440 --> 06:14.373
Just try and remind him

06:14.408 --> 06:16.408
of why you guys were so great together.

06:16.444 --> 06:18.544
I mean, we'd rip on each other

06:18.579 --> 06:20.379
until one of us took it too far,

06:20.414 --> 06:22.547
and then we'd have sex.

06:24.117 --> 06:25.416
Hmm.

06:25.452 --> 06:29.321
Your mom and I liked pie.

06:32.159 --> 06:33.758
Hey, you guys.

06:33.827 --> 06:35.560
Mary wanted to show you
her princess costume

06:35.595 --> 06:36.627
before the Halloween parade.

06:36.663 --> 06:38.163
I'm not a princess.

06:38.198 --> 06:40.065
I'm a queen.

06:40.133 --> 06:41.799
Yeah, you are.

06:41.835 --> 06:43.401
Your Majesty.

06:45.538 --> 06:47.472
You know, a bunch of stores
on the block are giving out candy.

06:47.507 --> 06:48.940
You have any Halloween treats?

06:49.009 --> 06:51.576
Uh, we really don't do anything special.

06:51.611 --> 06:54.511
How about if I get you vanilla ice cream

06:54.546 --> 06:56.280
and yell "Boo!"?

06:56.349 --> 06:58.148
I'll take one, too, but no "Boo."

06:58.184 --> 06:59.449
I mean, even if I know it's coming,

06:59.518 --> 07:00.885
I'll scream a little.

07:05.557 --> 07:07.624
That lady is staring at me.

07:07.659 --> 07:09.760
It's 'cause you're so pretty.

07:09.828 --> 07:13.497
I just had to tell you...
she is so adorable.

07:13.532 --> 07:15.632
Thanks. Have a nice day.

07:17.069 --> 07:18.702
It's great, what you're doing.

07:18.737 --> 07:21.671
I mean, if more people adopted,
it'd be a better world.

07:21.707 --> 07:24.508
I'm not adopted. He's my dad.

07:24.543 --> 07:27.443
Well, of course he is, sweetheart.

07:27.478 --> 07:28.811
You're a doll.

07:28.846 --> 07:29.946
Happy Halloween.

07:32.483 --> 07:34.017
I want to go.

07:34.052 --> 07:35.718
Sure you don't wanna wait
for your ice cream?

07:35.753 --> 07:36.986
No.

07:38.423 --> 07:40.456
Sorry. Uh, we gotta go.

07:40.491 --> 07:42.191
Mary.

07:42.260 --> 07:43.893
Becky. This is James.

07:43.962 --> 07:45.795
He's the real-estate agent
I was telling you about.

07:45.830 --> 07:47.030
Nice to meet you.

07:47.065 --> 07:48.030
Hi.

07:48.055 --> 07:50.566
So, James, what you got for us?

07:50.601 --> 07:55.238
Well, I did the research on
the old Lunch Box property...

07:55.273 --> 07:56.615
I don't know if Jackie told you,

07:56.640 --> 07:58.781
but she and I dated
back when I first got

07:58.806 --> 07:59.742
- my real-estate license.
- Oh.

07:59.743 --> 08:02.177
Yeah, this guy right here.

08:02.212 --> 08:05.047
A lot of keys
to a lot of empty properties.

08:05.082 --> 08:06.514
Fun for a while.

08:06.583 --> 08:08.150
You know, it might have been nice

08:08.185 --> 08:10.452
to throw in a dinner every now and then.

08:10.487 --> 08:11.519
Ooh, yeah.

08:11.555 --> 08:12.654
You're right.

08:12.722 --> 08:13.688
Well, why don't I take you to dinner

08:13.757 --> 08:15.057
and we'll catch up on old times?

08:15.092 --> 08:16.658
Well, the thing is, James,

08:16.726 --> 08:18.760
I'm still dealing
with a pretty bad breakup.

08:18.795 --> 08:20.162
I got cheated on.

08:20.230 --> 08:21.830
They say that time heals all,

08:21.865 --> 08:23.932
but they don't say how much time,

08:23.968 --> 08:25.867
you know, in emotional years.

08:25.902 --> 08:27.569
Oh, my God, my baby's in college.

08:27.604 --> 08:28.536
Can we get on with this?

08:28.605 --> 08:30.572
Right.

08:30.640 --> 08:32.773
Well, I was unable to find
the terms of the lease,

08:32.808 --> 08:36.443
so we'll just have to
contact the property owner,

08:36.479 --> 08:38.011
which would be...

08:38.047 --> 08:39.260
Beverly Harris.

08:39.285 --> 08:40.619
No. That's my mom.

08:40.644 --> 08:41.845
No. That's old info.

08:41.870 --> 08:44.718
She used to own the place,
but she sold it a long time ago.

08:44.743 --> 08:45.752
Mm, nope.

08:45.788 --> 08:48.389
As of today, she still owns it.

08:48.458 --> 08:49.991
Say what, now?

08:51.494 --> 08:52.493
If that's true,

08:52.528 --> 08:55.062
she's been collecting
rent checks this whole time

08:55.131 --> 08:57.598
while crying poverty
and living with you.

08:57.633 --> 08:59.900
My God, that's horrible, even for her.

08:59.935 --> 09:02.903
Finally! Somebody else gets it.

09:02.938 --> 09:05.785
When you see me on the news
smiling and covered in blood,

09:05.810 --> 09:08.084
you'll go, "Oh, okay."

09:13.395 --> 09:15.171
Hey, how was the parade?

09:15.254 --> 09:17.086
It was okay.

09:17.122 --> 09:19.176
Hey, Mark, why don't
you and Mary go upstairs

09:19.241 --> 09:21.074
and play for a few minutes
while I talk to your mom?

09:21.148 --> 09:23.348
I haven't vacuumed in a few days,

09:23.384 --> 09:25.851
but sure, I can have company.

09:30.057 --> 09:31.386
She didn't seem all that thrilled.

09:31.411 --> 09:32.420
Something happen?

09:32.445 --> 09:35.279
This woman at Casita Bonita
was staring at her.

09:35.315 --> 09:36.921
She didn't think Mary was my kid.

09:37.007 --> 09:39.023
Ah, that really sucks, Deej.

09:39.048 --> 09:40.314
But you are pretty white,

09:40.339 --> 09:42.515
kinda like Casper the stupid ghost.

09:43.164 --> 09:45.164
Friendly ghost.

09:45.200 --> 09:47.099
Yeah, I know what I said.

09:48.369 --> 09:50.069
You just gotta remind Mary

09:50.104 --> 09:52.604
that it doesn't matter
what other people say.

09:52.673 --> 09:55.074
She's a Conner, and the only
opinions that matter

09:55.109 --> 09:56.508
are the ones in this family

09:56.544 --> 09:58.177
and the ones in her heart.

09:58.213 --> 09:59.545
Wow.

09:59.580 --> 10:01.314
How come I never got
good advice like that?

10:01.382 --> 10:02.748
I just got, "You're a little freak,

10:02.783 --> 10:04.350
so get used to it."

10:06.120 --> 10:08.154
No, that's what you heard.

10:08.189 --> 10:10.189
What we said was, "Don't be surprised

10:10.258 --> 10:12.791
if people think you're a little freak."

10:15.362 --> 10:17.095
It just makes me so mad

10:17.130 --> 10:19.030
when people don't think
I'm part of this family.

10:19.066 --> 10:21.299
They don't stare when my mom's around.

10:21.335 --> 10:24.002
You can't stop people from staring.

10:24.071 --> 10:27.138
When I first noticed people
staring at me for wearing skirts,

10:27.174 --> 10:28.974
I got this big speech from my mom

10:29.009 --> 10:30.842
about how I should
celebrate my differences

10:30.911 --> 10:32.210
and be the bigger person.

10:32.279 --> 10:34.346
Did you do that? Did it help?

10:34.414 --> 10:36.314
Yep. And nope.

10:37.985 --> 10:39.885
It still hurts.

10:39.953 --> 10:41.219
Great.

10:41.255 --> 10:43.855
But what does help
is when I stare back at them

10:43.891 --> 10:45.571
with this big, scary smile.

10:45.596 --> 10:46.602
Really?

10:46.627 --> 10:48.392
Yeah, it makes them all freaked out.

10:48.427 --> 10:51.425
I just stare back
until they have to look away,

10:51.450 --> 10:52.449
like this.

10:57.303 --> 11:00.337
All right.

11:02.942 --> 11:05.976
"Ripped" Van Winkle is calling it.

11:08.147 --> 11:11.015
Halloween is officially over.

11:11.050 --> 11:14.351
After 9:00, it's just
stoned teenagers wearing parkas.

11:19.158 --> 11:21.158
Not a costume.

11:22.995 --> 11:26.262
Uh, I still don't get your costume.

11:26.298 --> 11:28.231
You're just Becky?

11:28.266 --> 11:29.466
No.

11:29.535 --> 11:31.835
I'm Becky before the baby.

11:36.341 --> 11:38.241
I took your advice,

11:38.276 --> 11:40.444
and I have been thinking
about all the things

11:40.479 --> 11:42.789
that made me and Ben so great together.

11:42.814 --> 11:45.015
We both love to verbally spar

11:45.083 --> 11:46.482
and we both like dark humor,

11:46.518 --> 11:48.451
so I just ordered him
a pair of boxing gloves

11:48.486 --> 11:49.619
and a copy of "Fargo."

11:49.655 --> 11:51.821
Cool.

11:51.857 --> 11:54.267
I'm gonna miss Ben.

11:54.931 --> 11:56.359
What?

11:56.394 --> 11:58.827
Here's a rule of thumb
for a meaningful gesture...

11:58.863 --> 12:00.377
you have to get your ass off the couch

12:00.464 --> 12:01.502
in order to do it.

12:03.100 --> 12:04.466
I'm lost here.

12:04.501 --> 12:06.168
I usually have the moral high ground.

12:06.203 --> 12:09.104
The view from down here sucks.

12:09.140 --> 12:11.640
Look, you cheated on him.

12:11.709 --> 12:14.109
It's gonna be hard for him to trust you.

12:14.145 --> 12:15.544
You just have to find a way

12:15.579 --> 12:18.647
to show him that
he is the only man in your life.

12:18.716 --> 12:21.483
So, basically, I have to kill David?

12:22.987 --> 12:25.353
I'm not telling you what to do.

12:25.389 --> 12:28.190
But, yeah, something romantic like that.

12:31.062 --> 12:34.962
♪ Ah, do-doo, doo-do-do-doo-do ♪

12:34.998 --> 12:36.498
Aaah!

12:36.533 --> 12:38.500
I didn't expect to see you there!

12:38.535 --> 12:40.635
You almost gave me a heart attack!

12:40.671 --> 12:44.839
You can't be attacked by
something that you don't have.

12:45.775 --> 12:48.843
Well, now I know I'm in the right place.

12:48.912 --> 12:51.313
You lied to me, Mother.

12:51.348 --> 12:53.014
You still own the Lunch Box.

12:53.049 --> 12:55.483
You've been collecting
rent from it for years.

12:55.519 --> 12:58.386
I let you move in here because
you told me you had nothing.

12:58.422 --> 13:00.722
I didn't want to tell you about it

13:00.757 --> 13:02.090
because I wanted to be able

13:02.125 --> 13:06.260
to leave something
for all of you when I go,

13:06.329 --> 13:08.829
especially for you, Little Bev!

13:08.864 --> 13:11.098
But you're never going to die.

13:11.133 --> 13:14.535
You're just going to change form!

13:14.604 --> 13:16.937
Well, we want to leave something

13:16.972 --> 13:18.539
for everybody, too, Grandma,

13:18.608 --> 13:20.608
which is why Jackie and I

13:20.643 --> 13:23.244
want to re-open the Lunch Box.

13:23.312 --> 13:24.411
Oh,

13:24.447 --> 13:26.980
the Conners and their dreams.

13:28.517 --> 13:31.218
If your mother and Jackie
couldn't make it work,

13:31.254 --> 13:33.220
what makes you think you can?

13:33.289 --> 13:35.256
I have a lot of great ideas.

13:35.291 --> 13:37.124
Oh, sweetie,

13:37.159 --> 13:40.093
I know you're doing better right now,

13:40.129 --> 13:41.561
but, really,

13:41.596 --> 13:43.596
you're an alcoholic.

13:46.201 --> 13:49.136
Look, I was trying
to be nice, ya old bat,

13:49.171 --> 13:51.738
but now I am changing my baby's name.

13:51.807 --> 13:53.506
What was Dad's mother's name?

13:53.541 --> 13:57.093
Oh, you wouldn't dare name
your baby after that lunatic.

13:57.160 --> 13:58.695
- Audrey.
- Audrey!

13:59.314 --> 14:01.047
Before you do anything drastic,

14:01.116 --> 14:03.917
you should know that anything
to do with the Lunch Box

14:03.952 --> 14:06.086
is not my decision anyway.

14:06.121 --> 14:09.256
What are you talking about?

14:09.291 --> 14:11.424
My mind isn't as a sharp
as it used to be.

14:11.493 --> 14:15.227
The other day, I forgot
the password to my phone.

14:15.263 --> 14:20.232
I thought it was "phone,"
but it was "password."

14:20.302 --> 14:22.168
At any rate,

14:22.203 --> 14:25.505
I gave power of attorney to Darlene.

14:25.540 --> 14:27.640
She makes all my financial decisions.

14:27.676 --> 14:29.008
- Darlene?!
- You what?!

14:29.043 --> 14:30.643
- What?!
- I'm your daughter.

14:30.712 --> 14:33.646
I'm the one who should be
making all of your decisions!

14:33.682 --> 14:36.349
If I'm afraid to make bad decisions,

14:36.384 --> 14:39.185
why would I want you to make them?

14:39.253 --> 14:41.023
I can't believe Darlene didn't tell me.

14:41.048 --> 14:42.835
All right, that's it. Pack your bags.

14:42.860 --> 14:44.274
Get the hell out of my apartment.

14:44.326 --> 14:46.459
I don't care if you live on the street.

14:46.494 --> 14:47.718
Jackie.

14:47.743 --> 14:49.519
Where on Earth is all this coming from?

14:49.563 --> 14:50.929
Come on. Come on.

14:50.964 --> 14:52.464
Becky, Audrey.

14:52.533 --> 14:53.630
And I'm warning you...

14:53.655 --> 14:55.115
you better not be here when I get back.

14:55.140 --> 14:57.602
I'm never speaking to you again.

14:58.806 --> 15:02.474
Well, someone has got to help me
get my suitcase down!

15:02.543 --> 15:04.710
All right, but after this,

15:04.745 --> 15:08.183
I am never speaking to you again.

15:15.901 --> 15:18.073
Hey. Trick or treat.

15:18.174 --> 15:21.628
If you're not here to work,
I don't need the interruption.

15:21.704 --> 15:23.711
Sorry. I-I had something to show you

15:23.774 --> 15:25.404
that can't wait until tomorrow.

15:25.473 --> 15:29.221
So, actions speak
louder than words, right?

15:30.111 --> 15:32.277
These are my divorce papers,

15:32.331 --> 15:34.690
and I'm gonna sign them
right here in front of you.

15:34.784 --> 15:36.216
Excuse me.

15:37.821 --> 15:40.690
Y-You weren't divorced?

15:48.500 --> 15:50.333
You were still married

15:50.368 --> 15:52.622
the entire time we were together?

15:54.039 --> 15:57.005
I didn't mention that?
I'm sure I mentioned that.

15:57.513 --> 15:59.246
I was planning a future with you.

15:59.281 --> 16:00.848
You don't think
it's important to tell me

16:00.883 --> 16:01.949
that you're still married?

16:01.984 --> 16:04.318
Look, I-I didn't even
see David for nine years.

16:04.353 --> 16:05.920
I didn't think of myself as married.

16:05.955 --> 16:08.756
I was too busy
raising my kids on my own,

16:08.791 --> 16:10.825
working, trying to scratch out a living.

16:10.893 --> 16:13.027
You're really playing
the single-mom card?

16:13.062 --> 16:15.028
It depends. Is it working?

16:16.606 --> 16:17.628
No? Okay. Look.

16:17.653 --> 16:19.299
Here, here, I-I'm signing it.

16:23.706 --> 16:25.405
Uh, this is not a sign of anything.

16:25.474 --> 16:26.707
I really want to do this.

16:33.482 --> 16:35.215
Don't you have one working pen here?

16:35.251 --> 16:38.686
Oh, you're right. It's all my fault.

16:39.656 --> 16:42.356
Look, I-I-I'm trying
to make things right here.

16:42.391 --> 16:43.790
It certainly can't be a bad thing

16:43.825 --> 16:45.325
that I'm getting divorced.

16:47.767 --> 16:48.828
Here.

17:01.276 --> 17:02.308
Okay.

17:02.343 --> 17:05.778
I guess it does say something
that you dumped him

17:05.813 --> 17:09.147
and are now divorcing him.

17:09.184 --> 17:10.516
You know, you're probably gonna enjoy

17:10.551 --> 17:13.286
hearing the most humiliating
part of all of this.

17:13.320 --> 17:15.488
David actually dumped me.

17:15.557 --> 17:18.191
He dumped you?

17:18.226 --> 17:20.425
So... So, you didn't choose me.

17:20.461 --> 17:22.994
You were left with me.

17:23.064 --> 17:24.296
Oh, no. No, no, no.

17:24.330 --> 17:26.397
I-I went to the couples therapist

17:26.433 --> 17:27.507
to break up with him, and then...

17:27.531 --> 17:29.798
You went to a couples therapist?

17:31.638 --> 17:34.272
So, what, you were trying to fix it?

17:34.308 --> 17:37.175
What if I kill David
as a romantic gesture?

17:42.549 --> 17:44.349
Hello, Darlene.

17:44.384 --> 17:47.619
May we have a minute of your time?

17:49.289 --> 17:52.257
Um, if this is an intervention,

17:52.326 --> 17:53.425
I don't drink that much,

17:53.460 --> 17:57.428
and my sex addiction seems
to have cleared up on its own.

17:57.463 --> 17:59.864
Uh, ever since you were a kid,

17:59.933 --> 18:03.367
I've considered you to be
the most level-headed

18:03.402 --> 18:07.304
and honest person in the Conner family.

18:07.340 --> 18:10.108
I'm hurt by that.

18:10.176 --> 18:12.009
But, actually, so did I.

18:13.947 --> 18:15.379
Where is this going?

18:15.414 --> 18:16.714
Why didn't you tell me

18:16.750 --> 18:19.316
that Bev gave you her power of attorney?

18:19.352 --> 18:20.361
She told you that?

18:20.386 --> 18:22.920
She swore to me on her life
that she wouldn't.

18:22.956 --> 18:24.455
And you believed her?!

18:24.490 --> 18:25.925
She's a liar!

18:27.526 --> 18:29.426
What has happened to you?

18:29.462 --> 18:30.895
You're hiding an affair,

18:30.930 --> 18:32.428
and now you're hiding this from me?

18:32.464 --> 18:33.630
No. This is different.

18:33.665 --> 18:35.298
I was trying to do the right thing

18:35.333 --> 18:36.466
for an old woman.

18:36.534 --> 18:39.269
Plus, I was a single mom with two kids

18:39.304 --> 18:41.204
trying to scratch out a living.

18:42.440 --> 18:44.474
All right. Never mind.

18:44.509 --> 18:46.243
I-I-I was wrong. I should have told you.

18:46.311 --> 18:48.812
Okay. I'm willing to give you
the benefit of the doubt.

18:48.847 --> 18:51.714
You just sign the Lunch Box over to me,

18:51.750 --> 18:54.951
and then, uh, Becky and I
can re-open the restaurant.

18:54.987 --> 18:57.387
Well, why do you want
to re-open the Lunch Box?

18:57.422 --> 18:58.497
It didn't work the last time.

18:58.560 --> 19:00.257
It's gonna be different this time.

19:00.325 --> 19:02.259
I'm gonna help Jackie run it.

19:02.294 --> 19:05.128
Since I got sober,
my smarts have kicked back in.

19:06.531 --> 19:08.364
Yeah. So, you look exhausted.

19:08.400 --> 19:10.533
Just write me a note saying
you're turning it over to me

19:10.568 --> 19:14.675
and then sign it and date it
and... and then go to bed.

19:16.007 --> 19:18.274
W... I can't do this right now.

19:18.310 --> 19:19.676
I-I have to think about it.

19:19.744 --> 19:21.110
There's nothing to think about.

19:21.145 --> 19:23.145
The Lunch Box belongs to me.

19:23.181 --> 19:24.514
Um, no.

19:24.549 --> 19:26.649
The Lunch Box belongs to all of us,

19:26.685 --> 19:28.217
and I have to think about what's best

19:28.286 --> 19:29.330
for the whole family.

19:29.393 --> 19:31.721
No, I've put up with that horrible woman

19:31.760 --> 19:34.424
my entire life,

19:34.459 --> 19:37.827
attacking me and tearing me down
every chance she got...

19:37.862 --> 19:39.228
"You're not good enough.

19:39.263 --> 19:42.531
What'd you do with your hair?

19:42.566 --> 19:45.835
You walk like a man."

19:45.870 --> 19:47.002
Well, she won't be saying that

19:47.038 --> 19:50.473
when I'm carrying her
cheap casket to the incinerator.

19:52.543 --> 19:54.668
I've earned this, Darlene.

19:55.112 --> 19:58.047
Okay, look,
I-I'm not saying no, all right?

19:58.082 --> 20:01.050
I-I just have a responsibility
to do the right thing,

20:01.085 --> 20:02.517
and I'm not gonna make a decision

20:02.586 --> 20:04.320
while I'm half-asleep
and being pressured.

20:04.355 --> 20:07.149
Don't talk to them, Darlene.

20:07.227 --> 20:08.557
They're insane.

20:08.592 --> 20:11.626
Oh, and I'm moving in.

20:11.860 --> 20:13.762
O-kay.

20:13.797 --> 20:16.398
Uh, not speaking to you,

20:16.433 --> 20:18.367
and until you do what's right,

20:18.402 --> 20:20.169
you're dead to me, Darlene.

20:24.375 --> 20:27.175
I would storm out,
but I live in the basement.

20:38.098 --> 20:40.776
It's just you and me now.

20:47.434 --> 20:49.060
I so hope you're haunting me.

20:49.631 --> 20:51.232
Please be your ghost.

20:51.399 --> 20:53.532
I'm living here now!

20:53.568 --> 20:55.383
What the hell happened?

20:55.430 --> 20:58.881
Jackie is mad at me, so
she put me out on the street.

20:58.967 --> 21:01.615
Then why aren't you out on the street?

21:01.678 --> 21:03.201
Oh, Dan, since you're up,

21:03.256 --> 21:05.550
would you go in the kitchen
and get me a glass of water

21:05.586 --> 21:07.886
for my teeth?

21:07.954 --> 21:11.021
