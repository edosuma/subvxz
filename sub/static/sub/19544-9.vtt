WEBVTT

00:08.217 --> 00:11.175
With Goku having returned
from the Next World

00:11.387 --> 00:14.971
to enter the newly decked-out
Tenkaichi Budokai,

00:15.182 --> 00:18.424
which was once again being held,

00:18.644 --> 00:23.229
the entire Dragon Team had all come together.

00:23.440 --> 00:25.897
The preliminary round,
to determine the 15 contestants

00:26.110 --> 00:30.570
who would move on to the
main event, was also underway.

00:30.781 --> 00:33.568
Their abilities being on
an entirely different level,

00:33.784 --> 00:36.992
Goku and the others pass the preliminaries.

00:38.330 --> 00:41.822
Hey, kid whose butt I'm gonna kick!

00:42.042 --> 00:43.498
Get lost, idiot!

00:43.711 --> 00:44.575
Why, you...!

00:44.795 --> 00:46.911
That was the wrong thing to say to me!

00:47.131 --> 00:50.214
I've just decided that I'm going
to beat you half to death!

00:50.426 --> 00:51.711
Oh, yeah?

00:51.927 --> 00:54.543
Okay, after many years' absence,
the reconvening

00:54.763 --> 00:57.470
of the Tenkaichi Budokai
is about to get underway!

00:59.852 --> 01:03.765
It looks like the tournament
has gone all razzle-dazzle, huh?

01:03.981 --> 01:06.313
First up, the junior division tournament,

01:06.525 --> 01:10.017
in which 35 pint-sized fighters
15 years of age and under

01:10.237 --> 01:14.276
compete for victory, was about to kick off.

01:16.000 --> 01:22.074

02:43.121 --> 02:49.117
"Everyone is Surprised!
Goten and Trunks' Super Battle!!"

02:51.338 --> 02:52.168
As you are aware,

02:52.381 --> 02:54.588
there is no preliminary round
for the junior division.

02:54.800 --> 02:57.542
35 mini-warriors have gathered
here at this tournament

02:57.761 --> 03:00.093
to show off their skills.

03:00.305 --> 03:02.466
The rules are the same as for the adults--

03:02.683 --> 03:05.390
giving up, going out of bounds,
being down for a ten-count,

03:05.602 --> 03:08.435
or being knocked out will constitute a loss.

03:08.647 --> 03:10.262
Good luck, Trunks!

03:10.482 --> 03:12.313
Goten-Chan!

03:12.526 --> 03:14.642
Fine, whatever, just hurry up and start.

03:14.862 --> 03:16.352
Here we are...

03:16.572 --> 03:18.938
Ah, thank goodness. I finally found a seat.

03:19.157 --> 03:22.741
I should be able to see
|dasa-chan quite well from here.

03:25.706 --> 03:27.947
All right, let's get started right away!

03:28.166 --> 03:30.248
The first match is between Bart-kun, age 12,

03:30.460 --> 03:32.746
and Peperone-kun, age 14!

03:32.963 --> 03:35.705
Aww, they've started.

03:35.924 --> 03:37.915
| wish they would hurry this up.

03:38.135 --> 03:41.377
That's right! Goten-kun is entered in this, huh?

03:50.564 --> 03:53.727
Uh-oh! He's started crying!

04:01.491 --> 04:03.027
Ah, ringout!

04:03.243 --> 04:07.327
This is amazing!
Cardpi-kun comes from behind to win!

04:08.916 --> 04:10.577
Hooray!

04:10.792 --> 04:14.535
Aww, these really are just playground fights.

04:14.755 --> 04:17.087
All right, moving on to the seventh match,

04:17.298 --> 04:19.039
it's Koryu-kun, age 10,

04:19.259 --> 04:21.375
versus lmamu-kun, age 8!

04:21.595 --> 04:23.005
Begin!

04:23.221 --> 04:24.722
Dosukoi! Dosukoi!

04:38.028 --> 04:40.519
Ringout! It's over!

04:42.658 --> 04:44.364
Young man...

04:45.786 --> 04:47.196
...don't cry, now.

04:47.412 --> 04:48.527
Mister Satan!

04:48.747 --> 04:53.036
Hold your head high!
Boys should not cry so easily!

04:54.878 --> 04:57.836
--Right!
--All right, that's a good boy.

05:00.884 --> 05:04.001
Oh, my! This is a delightful surprise!

05:04.221 --> 05:07.964
That's Mister Satan for you!
What a heartwarming scene!

05:08.183 --> 05:10.265
Yeah! Way to go, Satan!

05:10.477 --> 05:11.717
Way cool!

05:11.937 --> 05:15.805
Hmph, l nailed it. | more than nailed it!

05:16.024 --> 05:19.391
I'll have to use this again somewhere else.

05:19.611 --> 05:21.317
What's he doing there?

05:21.530 --> 05:27.150
Ah, good grief! That guy's
always thinking up something.

05:27.369 --> 05:29.951
It sounds like they're really
getting fired up out there.

05:30.163 --> 05:32.324
I hope they hurry this up.

05:33.333 --> 05:36.245
Ringout! Kalashnikov-kun wins!

05:36.461 --> 05:38.577
Moving on to the ninth match,

05:38.797 --> 05:41.834
it's Trunks-kun, age 8,
versus |dasa-kun, age 15!

05:42.050 --> 05:43.915
Oh, it's pee-wee Trunks!

05:44.136 --> 05:45.251
Stick it to him!

05:45.470 --> 05:48.837
Ah, but if he sticks it too much to him,
that would be bad.

05:49.057 --> 05:51.673
Go easy on him!

05:51.893 --> 05:54.270
Are you ready for this, you dirty runt?

05:54.479 --> 05:56.265
"Silence." l'm ignoring you.

05:56.481 --> 05:59.063
Sheesh, you sure are
pushing my buttons, you brat!

05:59.276 --> 06:01.938
Once again, I'm ignoring you.

06:02.154 --> 06:03.644
Aw, that's a shame.

06:03.864 --> 06:06.526
You have to feel bad, with an
8-year-old against a 15-year-old.

06:06.742 --> 06:08.403
Good luck, Trunks!

06:08.618 --> 06:11.200
|dasa-chan! lt's Mama!

06:12.330 --> 06:13.410
Geez, what's the big idea?!

06:13.623 --> 06:16.239
But then, poor |dasa-chan won't
be able to show off his abilities

06:16.460 --> 06:19.497
against a little runt like that.

06:19.713 --> 06:23.752
And l have to ask,
why did my camera have to break?

06:23.967 --> 06:26.424
I won't be able to capture
|dasa-chan's gallantry.

06:26.636 --> 06:30.174
Trunks! Hurry up and pound
that goofy-looking kid's face!

06:30.390 --> 06:32.472
My, how crude.

06:33.977 --> 06:35.592
Begin!

06:37.314 --> 06:40.021
Come at me, you dirty little runt! Come on!

06:40.233 --> 06:44.772
You're such a windbag.
You don't have to tell me to fight you.

06:54.414 --> 06:58.157
Tch, I might have taken that
a little too personally.

06:58.376 --> 07:00.082
I guess I am a brat.

07:00.295 --> 07:02.286
H-He's unconscious!

07:02.506 --> 07:04.918
Trunks-kun is the winner!

07:06.093 --> 07:07.674
Awesome!

07:09.262 --> 07:11.127
l-ldasa-chan!

07:12.682 --> 07:18.052
Good grief, this is going to be dull
until Trunks and Goten fight.

07:19.981 --> 07:22.518
I'm in the match after the match after this one.

07:22.734 --> 07:27.353
This is why I asked them to let us
fight with the adults. You know?

07:42.587 --> 07:47.672
The battle of the kids
displaying their skills went on.

07:51.138 --> 07:55.381
Okay, let's keep moving along!
Next up is the 16th match--

07:55.600 --> 08:01.095
lkose-kun, age 14,
versus Son Goten-kun, age 7!

08:19.332 --> 08:21.709
Tch, this little kid, huh?

08:24.629 --> 08:28.213
Ah! It's time for Goten's turn!

08:28.425 --> 08:31.383
I can't wait to see what
kind of a match it will be.

08:33.138 --> 08:39.099
lkose-chan! Don't get caught
off-guard like your older brother!

08:39.311 --> 08:44.601
Goten-Chan! Make sure you hold back on him!

08:44.816 --> 08:47.853
To think, yet another little snot
from that gang of ill-breds

08:48.069 --> 08:51.687
will be facing my genteel son.
Oh, it's so unpalatable!

08:51.907 --> 08:55.320
Oh, my! Here I am, thinking that
yet another dim-looking lame-o

08:55.535 --> 08:58.993
was on his way, and look!
It's his younger brother!

08:59.206 --> 09:02.448
My word! Miracles do not happen twice!

09:02.667 --> 09:06.376
I hope your little snot meets an ugly fate!

09:11.301 --> 09:15.340
Wow! So many people have come to watch!

09:17.682 --> 09:21.049
The kid's got stage fright
because of all the spectators.

09:24.731 --> 09:28.644
Huh? That face... Son Goten?

09:44.042 --> 09:46.454
I won, man!

09:49.172 --> 09:52.460
So that's it. He's Son Goku-kun's son,
no doubt about it.

09:52.676 --> 09:54.917
He looks just like he did as a child.

09:55.136 --> 09:57.798
All right, then, please begin the match!

10:00.517 --> 10:03.554
Good luck, Goten! Take it easy!

10:04.646 --> 10:08.184
lkose-chan! Bang-bang
him up good! Bang-bang!

10:12.404 --> 10:14.520
Let's see, is this it?

10:18.702 --> 10:21.444
It sounds like Goten-kun's match has started.

10:21.663 --> 10:24.746
Mm-hmm, I heard. If we don't
finish the preliminaries soon,

10:24.958 --> 10:26.914
we won't be able to go watch.

10:27.127 --> 10:28.037
Is it ready yet?

10:28.253 --> 10:32.462
Sorry, but the new
punch machine is acting up.

10:53.945 --> 10:57.529
| wish I didn't get someone like you
to go against, you know?

10:57.741 --> 11:00.858
Take this! Killer Punch!

11:05.832 --> 11:09.825
Hey, do it for real. As hard as you can.

11:11.838 --> 11:14.500
|-|t looks like you're not half-bad, huh?

11:16.968 --> 11:19.835
lkose-chan is finally getting down to business!

11:20.055 --> 11:23.718
Still, I wonder how many seconds
that lame-o will last.

11:25.101 --> 11:27.683
lkose-chan! Beat him! Please!

11:27.896 --> 11:31.138
Clobber that little snot, for Mama's sake!

11:34.277 --> 11:37.314
Hmm, so that's all you've got, huh?

11:37.530 --> 11:39.031
I've had enough.

11:45.288 --> 11:47.199
Awesome! A one-punch knockout!

11:47.415 --> 11:48.916
He got him, he got him!

11:49.125 --> 11:50.240
Of course he did.

11:50.460 --> 11:54.794
H-Hey! lkose-kun! l-lkose-kun!

11:55.006 --> 11:58.840
He's out cold. Son Goten-kun is the winner!

12:08.436 --> 12:11.519
I won't stand for this any longer!

12:16.069 --> 12:18.276
That's gone and made it quieter.

12:19.864 --> 12:23.277
Hey! It looks like the 7-year-old kid won!

12:23.493 --> 12:25.074
Ah, it sounds like Goten-kun won!

12:25.286 --> 12:27.698
Isn't that incredible? Against a 14-year-old!

12:27.914 --> 12:29.245
Mm-hmm.

12:29.457 --> 12:31.368
It's only natural that he would.

12:31.584 --> 12:32.790
What, aren't you happy?

12:33.002 --> 12:36.369
Eh? I'm delighted! Oh, yeah? He won, huh?

12:36.589 --> 12:39.422
The matches continued on...

12:50.562 --> 12:52.302
Goten-kun is the winner!

12:52.522 --> 12:54.683
He did it! He did it!

13:15.253 --> 13:16.743
Now!

13:26.347 --> 13:27.723
Trunks-kun is the winner!

13:27.932 --> 13:29.547
He did it!

13:34.856 --> 13:38.599
Goten and Trunks rapidly won
their way upward, and the final match,

13:38.818 --> 13:43.778
as a matter of course, ended up
being between the two of them.

13:58.379 --> 14:02.042
All right, it's now time for
the championship match!

14:02.258 --> 14:03.794
Our pairing for the
championship match will be

14:04.010 --> 14:08.253
Trunks-kun, age 8, and Goten-kun, age 7!

14:14.479 --> 14:15.935
Good luck, Trunks!

14:16.147 --> 14:20.481
Goten-Chan, win this and earn
a whole mess of prize money!

14:20.693 --> 14:23.184
At last, we're going to see
an interesting match.

14:23.404 --> 14:24.905
Yeah.

14:31.704 --> 14:33.990
This fight is all mine!

14:34.207 --> 14:35.822
Like you're going to beat me!

14:46.052 --> 14:49.636
Mister Satan! Mister Satan!

14:49.847 --> 14:52.509
Oh, were you asleep?

14:52.725 --> 14:54.340
Oh, no, no.

14:54.561 --> 14:57.303
l was focusing my mind before the matches.

14:57.522 --> 15:00.605
Now that I'm the champion,
| always have to be in tip-top form

15:00.817 --> 15:04.560
when I'm heading into a match,
and it's a big deal.

15:06.322 --> 15:09.814
The junior division championship
match is about to begin,

15:10.034 --> 15:13.777
and there are two awfully
strong children competing.

15:13.997 --> 15:16.363
Champion, how would you like to watch them?

15:16.583 --> 15:19.199
I believe it will be a very interesting match.

15:19.419 --> 15:23.253
Hmph, well, if you insist.
I guess I'll watch for a bit.

15:23.464 --> 15:28.049
After all, I'm going to have to
go up against the winning kid.

15:28.261 --> 15:31.549
And now, the junior division
championship match is upon us!

15:31.764 --> 15:36.724
Will the victor end up being
Trunks-kun or Son Goten-kun?

15:36.936 --> 15:41.475
Both have made it this far by winning
with devastating strength.

15:41.691 --> 15:45.980
And what's more, I understand
that these two are good friends!

15:46.195 --> 15:48.447
Good luck to the smaller guy!

15:48.656 --> 15:50.317
Give us a good match!

15:50.533 --> 15:52.364
Fight! Fight!

15:56.998 --> 15:58.863
Good luck!

16:03.171 --> 16:06.163
The championship match is beginning!

16:06.382 --> 16:09.340
Excuse me, are you done yet? We're in a hurry!

16:10.345 --> 16:12.506
We just barely got it fixed.

16:12.722 --> 16:13.552
Well, I'll be right there...

16:13.765 --> 16:17.303
No line-cutting! Wait your turn!

16:17.518 --> 16:18.428
Yeah, yeah!

16:18.645 --> 16:20.385
Oh, but I...

16:20.605 --> 16:23.893
--No, no! Please get back in line.
--Yeah, but... ljust...

16:24.108 --> 16:26.440
We're in a hurry here!

16:26.653 --> 16:28.609
Nothing doing. Those are the rules.

16:28.821 --> 16:31.984
Huh?! But we're going to miss the match!

16:33.326 --> 16:34.907
Now the moment you've been waiting for!

16:35.119 --> 16:37.781
All right, please begin
the championship match

16:37.997 --> 16:40.989
for the Tenkaichi Budokai junior division!

16:43.252 --> 16:47.791
l'm warning you, I'm not
going to hold back, Goten!

16:48.007 --> 16:51.465
Uh-huh, me neither!

16:51.678 --> 16:53.043
Those two, huh?

16:53.262 --> 16:56.425
Yes, that's right. They said
they're 7 and 8 years old.

16:56.641 --> 16:59.599
I'm impressed those two kids are still in it.

17:03.189 --> 17:08.809
Wait, it seems like I've met that kid
somewhere before, only not...

17:15.076 --> 17:16.816
Goten!

17:17.036 --> 17:19.321
--Tru n ks!
--Yay! Yay!

17:22.458 --> 17:25.540
Keep it loose, Trunks and Goten!

17:52.530 --> 17:54.862
Whoa! Awesome!

17:55.074 --> 17:57.451
Ah! They've already started!

17:57.660 --> 18:00.322
Ah, wait up, Gohan-kun!

18:02.081 --> 18:05.619
Whoo! Sorry to keep you waiting!
We finally passed the preliminary!

18:05.835 --> 18:07.325
Took you long enough, huh?

18:08.963 --> 18:12.251
I thought you two might
have been off on a date.

18:12.467 --> 18:15.504
You've got it wrong! It's not like that!

18:15.720 --> 18:17.085
Sure, sure.

18:17.305 --> 18:20.468
Thank goodness you made it in time.
It's just getting good!

18:23.644 --> 18:25.726
Way to go, both of you!

18:36.991 --> 18:38.731
Whoo, that's cold!

18:51.339 --> 18:54.672
Attaway! Goten! Trunks!

19:04.977 --> 19:06.478
Goten-Chan!

19:14.153 --> 19:17.020
--Goten! Go! Hang in there!
--Trunks! What are you doing?!

19:17.240 --> 19:19.856
--Hang in there! Go! Goten!
--Stick with him!

19:23.704 --> 19:26.081
--Good! Good! Goten-Chan!
--Easy, I'm not a toy!

19:26.290 --> 19:28.781
Trunks!

20:04.203 --> 20:06.489
Go! Go! Trunks!

20:06.706 --> 20:08.367
Goten!

20:41.574 --> 20:45.192
W-Who are those guys...?

20:45.411 --> 20:50.326
Th-This is a fight between
7- and 8-year-old children?

20:50.541 --> 20:54.284
Teeny Trunks and Goten are
both pretty good, ain't they?

20:54.503 --> 20:56.243
Aren't they?

20:56.464 --> 20:59.831
Good going! Good going! Trunks! Goten!

21:02.345 --> 21:05.087
A... Awesome!

21:13.814 --> 21:18.683
The fight between Trunks
and Goten shows promise.

21:18.903 --> 21:25.399
Which one will triumph over the
Tenkaichi Budokai junior division?

22:41.736 --> 22:43.226
Heya! l'm Goku!

22:43.446 --> 22:48.065
Not bad, Goten and Trunks!
Just what you'd expect of Saiyan kids!

22:48.284 --> 22:49.649
You've gotten better, huh, Goten?

22:49.869 --> 22:52.235
But I'm still going to be the one who wins!

22:52.455 --> 22:54.491
Heh-heh, I'm not going to be beaten!

22:54.707 --> 22:56.322
Next time on Dragon Ball Z Kai,

22:56.542 --> 23:00.330
"The Junior Champ is Finally Decided!!
Who Will Fight Against Satan?!"

23:00.546 --> 23:05.461
Aw, I told both of you,
you can't go turning Super Saiyan!

23:06.305 --> 23:12.366
