00:18.351 --> 00:22.313
I had an interesting conversation
with your neighbor, Carol Sullivan.

00:22.397 --> 00:24.315
She said you threatened her
with a palette knife?

00:24.399 --> 00:25.400
Oh my God.

00:25.483 --> 00:30.280
No. I was washing my brushes.
I forgot that I had it in my hand.

00:30.363 --> 00:33.533
I thought
she was harassing our handyman.

00:33.616 --> 00:36.036
It was a miscommunication,
and I apologized.

00:37.912 --> 00:39.539
What is that?
Why are you writing that down?

00:39.622 --> 00:43.001
She also said she saw you
talking to Chastity the day of the murder.

00:43.084 --> 00:45.003
-I didn't know you knew her.
-I didn't.

00:45.503 --> 00:47.130
I'd only just met her the day before.

00:47.213 --> 00:48.506
Carol said she saw

00:48.590 --> 00:51.760
what she thought was a confrontation
between you and Chasity.

00:51.843 --> 00:53.720
Said you jumped out of your car,

00:53.803 --> 00:55.597
left it running
in the middle of the street,

00:55.680 --> 00:57.057
kind of got in her face.

00:57.140 --> 01:00.518
Jesus, what does that woman do?
Just stare out her window all day?

01:00.602 --> 01:03.146
What exactly were
you and Chasity talking about?

01:03.730 --> 01:07.692
She was throwing away some markers
that I had given to Neil's daughter.

01:07.776 --> 01:09.736
She said she didn't like
the way they smelled.

01:09.819 --> 01:10.737
Hmm.

01:11.404 --> 01:14.616
This is insane.
I wouldn't kill someone over markers.

01:14.699 --> 01:16.034
What would you kill someone over?

01:22.040 --> 01:22.957
-Hello.

01:24.000 --> 01:26.628
I'm gonna be taking
your fingerprints today.

01:26.711 --> 01:28.713
Are you familiar with how this works?

01:29.756 --> 01:30.590
No.

01:30.673 --> 01:34.052
Well, I am going to be placing
your inked fingerprints

01:34.135 --> 01:36.221
on this ten-print card.

01:36.888 --> 01:40.058
I'm gonna have you
give me your right hand,

01:40.141 --> 01:42.852
and I'm gonna start with your right thumb.

01:42.936 --> 01:46.356
Now we're not gonna be pushing
your print straight down.

01:46.439 --> 01:47.732
We're gonna be rolling it,

01:47.816 --> 01:49.943
'cause if we pushed it,
it would just smoosh it.

01:50.026 --> 01:52.821
So we're gonna roll it very gently.

01:53.988 --> 01:55.115
All right. Here we go.

01:55.198 --> 01:56.658
Okay. No, just…

01:57.408 --> 01:59.828
Ma'am, just let me gently roll it.

02:00.411 --> 02:01.496
There you go.

02:02.288 --> 02:06.459
I actually find it easier…
…to fingerprint people at autopsies,

02:06.543 --> 02:10.380
because a lot of times living people
try to help you out a little too much.

02:12.090 --> 02:14.050
Gonna go to number six.

02:14.634 --> 02:16.010
That's your left thumb.

02:20.932 --> 02:22.183
How's your day going?

02:23.685 --> 02:24.561
Fine.

02:25.603 --> 02:27.814
All right. That's all I need.

02:28.648 --> 02:30.483
-Have a good night.

02:32.819 --> 02:34.279
Is that it? Can I go?

02:35.864 --> 02:36.781
Why flowers?

02:38.700 --> 02:40.869
-Excuse me?
-You paint flowers. How come?

02:41.369 --> 02:43.163
Seriously? That's what
you wanna talk about?

02:43.246 --> 02:45.248
I saw the paintings in your house.

02:45.331 --> 02:46.416
They're beautiful.

02:47.250 --> 02:48.626
You're very talented.

02:49.419 --> 02:50.253
Thank you.

02:52.714 --> 02:53.673
You don't wanna tell me?

02:59.304 --> 03:02.098
Fine.
I didn't always paint flowers.

03:03.266 --> 03:06.394
When I first started,
I painted landscapes, sailboats,

03:07.228 --> 03:08.980
<i>you know, the stuff that tourists buy.</i>

03:10.106 --> 03:13.359
<i>I was the starving artist,</i>
<i>barely making ends meet.</i>

03:13.443 --> 03:17.447
<i>My first brush with any kind of success</i>
<i>was an accident, really.</i>

03:18.156 --> 03:22.702
<i>I was bored one day,</i>
<i>so I painted my dog as the Mona Lisa.</i>

03:26.539 --> 03:27.749
<i>People loved it.</i>

03:30.126 --> 03:32.337
<i>I started getting</i>
<i>tons of orders.</i>

03:33.254 --> 03:35.590
<i>I basically became a cottage industry</i>

03:35.673 --> 03:37.884
<i>of putting people's dogs</i>
<i>into masterpieces.</i>

03:41.262 --> 03:42.931
But I started getting burnt out

03:44.432 --> 03:46.726
and had basically given up painting

03:48.061 --> 03:51.064
until I was pregnant with Elizabeth.

03:51.648 --> 03:53.399
<i>I was showing signs of early labor,</i>

03:53.983 --> 03:55.902
<i>and they put me on strict bed rest.</i>

03:57.362 --> 04:02.242
<i>One day, the nurse brought in</i>
<i>the most beautiful bouquet of flowers.</i>

04:03.993 --> 04:08.039
<i>I stared at it, and I felt this passion</i>

04:08.122 --> 04:11.167
<i>rising up inside of me</i>
<i>that I'd never felt before,</i>

04:11.251 --> 04:14.504
<i>and I knew I had to paint them.</i>

04:17.382 --> 04:20.176
<i>My husband and our handyman, Buell,</i>

04:20.260 --> 04:23.972
<i>custom-built me an easel</i>
<i>so I could paint from my bed.</i>

04:25.056 --> 04:28.518
<i>And I'd never felt</i>
<i>so aligned with a subject.</i>

04:30.687 --> 04:32.647
<i>Something about their fragile beauty,</i>

04:33.523 --> 04:37.151
<i>so delicate yet brave enough</i>
<i>to open themselves up</i>

04:37.235 --> 04:39.737
<i>in a world that can be so harsh.</i>

04:41.406 --> 04:45.785
<i>For the next three months in that bed,</i>
<i>I did nothing but paint…</i>

04:48.621 --> 04:51.124
<i>and it was the best work</i>
<i>I'd ever produced…</i>

04:53.584 --> 04:55.044
<i>until Elizabeth came.</i>

04:59.132 --> 05:01.092
Of course, I stopped painting when…

05:02.593 --> 05:04.804
When Elizabeth passed. Mmm.

05:04.887 --> 05:08.224
That must have been
so hard for you, losing your daughter.

05:08.725 --> 05:11.185
I would have been so… angry.

05:14.981 --> 05:15.898
Nice try.

05:17.150 --> 05:20.111
You think you're gonna trick me
into saying I was so angry

05:20.194 --> 05:21.404
that I murdered someone?

05:21.487 --> 05:23.364
I don't wanna trick you at all, Anna.

05:23.448 --> 05:26.326
But if you'd be more comfortable
with a lawyer present--

05:26.409 --> 05:27.994
I don't need a goddamn lawyer.

05:28.077 --> 05:30.413
I have nothing to hide.
I didn't do anything.

05:30.496 --> 05:32.623
Is there a chance you did
and just don't remember?

05:32.707 --> 05:35.293
-What does that mean?
-I want you to listen to something.

05:39.213 --> 05:40.673
<i>911. What's your emergency?</i>

05:40.757 --> 05:42.884
<i>There's a murder.</i>
<i>A woman has been murdered.</i>

05:43.551 --> 05:46.721
<i>406 Canterbury Hill.</i>
<i>Hurry! </i>

05:46.804 --> 05:49.098
<i>Ma'am, slow down.</i>
<i>Can you repeat the address?</i>

05:49.182 --> 05:51.267
<i>406 Canterbury…</i>

05:51.351 --> 05:53.895
<i>-No, wait. That's my address. 40…</i>
-Mmm.

05:53.978 --> 05:56.939
-<i>407. 407 Canter--</i>

05:57.440 --> 05:59.734
That doesn't sound like someone
who's in their right mind.

05:59.817 --> 06:02.236
This is insane. I would never hurt anyone!

06:02.320 --> 06:03.905
I believe you believe that.

06:05.531 --> 06:08.201
There was a case
a few years ago up in Rockport.

06:08.284 --> 06:10.995
A man killed his wife of 33 years.

06:12.372 --> 06:14.290
He'd never said an unkind word to her.

06:14.374 --> 06:16.000
Then one night out of nowhere,

06:16.084 --> 06:18.044
he rolled over in bed, grabbed a lamp,

06:18.127 --> 06:20.338
and hit her until her skull caved in.

06:21.172 --> 06:24.050
He'd taken sleeping pills,
mixed it with alcohol.

06:25.510 --> 06:27.303
He woke up the next morning.

06:27.387 --> 06:29.889
He had no idea he was the one who did it.

06:31.682 --> 06:32.850
Detective Lane?

06:33.476 --> 06:34.560
I'll be right back.

06:42.360 --> 06:45.029
Miss Whitaker,
can you stand up please?

06:47.490 --> 06:48.449
Face the wall.

06:49.200 --> 06:51.786
-What's going on?
Put your hands behind your back.

06:51.869 --> 06:52.870
What's happening?

06:53.496 --> 06:55.331
-Wh--
-The prints were a match, Anna.

06:56.332 --> 06:59.502
Anna Whitaker, you are under arrest
for the murder of Chastity Linkous.

06:59.585 --> 07:02.130
-No, I--
-You have the right to remain silent.

07:02.213 --> 07:03.047
Detective Lane.

07:03.131 --> 07:07.635
Anything you say can and will be used
against you in a court of law.

07:24.068 --> 07:25.903
Put your clothes in the bag.

07:29.866 --> 07:32.702
-Put all your jewelry in here.

08:15.953 --> 08:17.163
[keys jangling

08:25.087 --> 08:26.047
Douglas?

08:26.130 --> 08:26.964
Take my hand.

08:34.347 --> 08:38.184
-What are you doing here?
-Shh. It's okay. Come with me.

08:45.816 --> 08:46.901
What's happening?

08:46.984 --> 08:48.528
Just a little bit further.

08:54.534 --> 08:55.451
A wedding?

08:56.577 --> 08:58.329
A second chance at love.

09:02.250 --> 09:04.418
Douglas, wait.

09:19.267 --> 09:21.018
Wait. Wait.

09:46.002 --> 09:47.670
I'm so happy to see you.

09:47.753 --> 09:48.838
Thank you so much.

09:48.921 --> 09:49.922
Aww.

09:50.423 --> 09:54.677
Now just promise me
that you won't go fleeing the country,

09:54.760 --> 09:57.013
or I'll be out $500,000.

09:57.096 --> 09:59.515
The only place I wanna flee is to my bed.

10:07.064 --> 10:08.274
So did you do it?

10:08.357 --> 10:09.483
Sloane! No. Jesus.

10:09.567 --> 10:12.194
-You can tell me, Anna.
-There's nothing to tell.

10:12.278 --> 10:14.405
Well, you owe me some kind of explanation.

10:14.488 --> 10:16.490
I had to take a fucking loan out
against the gallery.

10:16.574 --> 10:19.785
Well, I'd like an explanation too,
'cause none of this makes any sense.

10:19.869 --> 10:21.704
Anna, you were obsessed with that family.

10:21.787 --> 10:25.416
-You were obsessed with that woman.
-So that means I killed her?

10:25.499 --> 10:27.209
Your prints were all over
the murder weapon.

10:27.293 --> 10:29.045
Jesus, Sloane, you know me!

10:30.921 --> 10:33.299
A lot has happened.
You've been to a lot of dark places.

10:33.382 --> 10:36.969
Well, I'm in a really fucking dark place
right now and could really use a friend.

10:39.472 --> 10:40.806
I'm your friend, Anna.

10:43.601 --> 10:47.063
And the truth is, if you asked me to,
I'll drive you to Mexico.

10:47.146 --> 10:47.980
Right now.

10:48.564 --> 10:49.857
I didn't do it, Sloane.

10:51.776 --> 10:53.194
I have nothing to run from.

11:00.076 --> 11:03.621
-Do you want me to stay with you tonight?
-No. I'll be fine.

11:04.622 --> 11:05.998
I don't believe you.

11:07.416 --> 11:08.668
Yeah. No one does.

11:21.639 --> 11:22.807
Oh my God.

11:24.850 --> 11:26.644
Sloane, I'm fi-- Neil.

11:27.478 --> 11:30.439
I saw the police over here this morning
looking through your house.

11:30.523 --> 11:31.732
I talked to one of them.

11:32.358 --> 11:34.735
-They said you were charged with murder?
-I… I didn't do any--

11:34.819 --> 11:37.113
I came over here 'cause I wanted
to show you something.

11:39.740 --> 11:41.492


11:41.575 --> 11:45.496
If you come anywhere
near Emma or me again,

11:45.579 --> 11:46.997
I will use it.

12:45.473 --> 12:46.807
Goddamn it.

13:14.919 --> 13:16.545
What the fuck is up there?

14:23.612 --> 14:24.905
<i>Hello.</i>
-I need to talk.

14:24.989 --> 14:26.866
<i> I'm sorry.</i>
<i>I can't. I'm with a patient.</i>

14:26.949 --> 14:30.160
I think I killed someone.
I… I'm being charged with murder,

14:30.244 --> 14:33.664
and… …there's blood in the attic.

14:33.747 --> 14:36.083
-<i> Just slow down.</i>
-No, don't tell me to slow down.

14:36.166 --> 14:37.501
I… I lied to you.

14:37.585 --> 14:42.464
I <i>have</i> been drinking
and taking those pills you prescribed.

14:42.548 --> 14:46.260
Maybe I did do it,
and I just don't remember.

14:47.136 --> 14:51.140
-<i> You're not making any sense.</i>
-I mean, she… she had the life I wanted.

14:51.223 --> 14:53.726
The life that I once had.

14:53.809 --> 14:54.643
<i>Who?</i>

14:54.727 --> 14:57.313
The woman
in the house across the street!

14:57.396 --> 14:58.647
<i>Just breathe.</i>

14:59.148 --> 15:00.774
I think I killed her.

15:02.192 --> 15:06.864
I mean,
there's blood in the… the attic.

15:06.947 --> 15:09.033
What if I killed lots of people?

15:09.116 --> 15:11.368
<i> Anna,</i>
<i>I know you better than anyone.</i>

15:11.452 --> 15:14.747
<i>You're not a killer,</i>
<i>and I'm not just a psychiatrist.</i>

15:17.124 --> 15:18.250
I was your husband.

15:21.378 --> 15:24.632
Well, I killed our daughter, didn't I?

15:24.715 --> 15:26.133
What are you talking about?

15:26.216 --> 15:27.885
<i> You weren't gonna take her</i>
<i>that day.</i>

15:27.968 --> 15:28.886
You didn't even know

15:28.969 --> 15:31.680
it was Take Your Daughter to Work Day
until I told you.

15:32.806 --> 15:34.850
I'm the reason Elizabeth is dead.

15:34.934 --> 15:36.143
<i>Anna, stop it.</i>

15:36.226 --> 15:38.854
I'm the one
that left her alone in that room.

15:39.521 --> 15:41.357
If it's anyone's fault, it's mine.

15:41.440 --> 15:43.484
You were just doing your job, Douglas.

15:43.567 --> 15:46.153
Well, my number one job
was protecting our daughter.

15:46.779 --> 15:47.613
I failed.

15:47.696 --> 15:49.239
It's not your fault.

15:49.323 --> 15:51.367
Well, it sure as hell isn't your fault.

15:51.450 --> 15:52.993
Maybe it's nobody's fault

15:53.827 --> 15:55.162
but Massacre Mike's.

15:57.331 --> 15:59.291
Maybe he's the one we should be hating…

16:00.501 --> 16:01.460
…not ourselves.

16:03.337 --> 16:04.672
Not each other.

16:05.547 --> 16:07.132
I could never hate you, Anna.

16:08.717 --> 16:11.220
Even though I'm the one
who destroyed our marriage?

16:11.303 --> 16:13.055
I shut you out.

16:13.555 --> 16:17.351
You can't shut out someone
whose door is already closed.

16:18.268 --> 16:20.354
I didn't know how to love anymore.

16:20.437 --> 16:23.273
For all my degrees, I didn't have a clue

16:24.233 --> 16:25.526
how to handle any of it.

16:29.154 --> 16:30.990
<i>Anna, are you in the attic now?</i>

16:34.493 --> 16:35.327
No.

16:36.412 --> 16:37.997
Okay. You're gonna go up there.

16:40.749 --> 16:41.667
Okay.

16:48.465 --> 16:49.508
Douglas, I'm scared.

16:49.591 --> 16:52.177
There's no need to be scared.
I'm right here.

16:52.761 --> 16:54.096
The blood…

16:54.722 --> 16:57.016
Whatever's up there,
you can face it. I'm with you.

17:06.150 --> 17:07.443
You can do it, Anna.

17:08.152 --> 17:09.403
Okay.

17:09.486 --> 17:11.530
<i>Imagine I'm holding your hand.</i>

17:16.118 --> 17:16.994
Oh God.

17:48.275 --> 17:49.151
Oh my God.

17:49.234 --> 17:50.611
What? What is it?

17:53.614 --> 17:54.656
It's paint.

17:56.158 --> 17:57.576
It's just red paint.

17:59.620 --> 18:02.956
See? You, uh… you didn't kill anyone.

18:03.791 --> 18:05.626
Then why do I have this memory?

18:05.709 --> 18:10.339
This… this memory of me stabbing her?

18:27.397 --> 18:30.359
"Look at me. I'm so pretty."

18:31.693 --> 18:34.863
Perfect face, perfect body,

18:35.572 --> 18:36.949
perfect life.

18:43.914 --> 18:45.207
I didn't stab her.

18:45.707 --> 18:47.835
I stabbed a painting.

18:47.918 --> 18:49.545
I didn't kill anybody.

18:50.045 --> 18:51.547
Of course you didn't.

18:51.630 --> 18:54.591
But they found my palette knife
next to her body.

18:55.092 --> 18:56.844
It has my fingerprints on it.

18:56.927 --> 18:58.387
<i>There's gotta be an explanation.</i>

18:58.470 --> 19:00.389
Someone could've taken the knife
from the house.

19:00.472 --> 19:01.765
Who?

19:01.849 --> 19:03.976
Could anyone have gotten into the house
without you knowing?

19:44.224 --> 19:45.517
Oh my God!

19:45.601 --> 19:46.643
Anna?

19:46.727 --> 19:48.854
Buell has been living up here.

19:48.937 --> 19:49.771
What?

19:49.855 --> 19:52.357
I knew I had been hearing noises.

19:52.441 --> 19:54.151
It was fucking Buell.

19:54.234 --> 19:55.235
Good God.

19:55.319 --> 19:56.153
<i>Douglas,</i>

19:57.070 --> 20:00.657
is there anything about Buell
that you didn't tell me

20:01.742 --> 20:05.746
back when you hired him
to fix our mailbox all those years ago?

20:05.829 --> 20:07.831
-Like what?
-<i> Like about his past.</i>

20:08.415 --> 20:10.334
How did he become our handyman?

20:10.918 --> 20:11.793
He was my patient.

20:12.586 --> 20:14.338
-Your patient?
-Yeah. My very first patient.

20:14.421 --> 20:18.258
I, um, rehabilitated him
and… and got him released early.

20:19.176 --> 20:20.344
From where?

20:20.427 --> 20:23.472
State hospital.
He had been found criminally insane.

20:26.516 --> 20:27.976
What did he do?

20:28.060 --> 20:30.771
He killed his entire family
with a claw hammer.

20:37.194 --> 20:41.073
Why did you not tell me about this before?

20:41.156 --> 20:43.116
Well, I didn't think you'd want him
to work for us.

20:43.200 --> 20:44.952
I wouldn't have!

20:45.035 --> 20:47.079
But we needed someone to fix the mailbox.

20:47.162 --> 20:48.705
It's still not fixed!

20:48.789 --> 20:50.207
-What?
-<i>Buell did it.</i>

20:50.916 --> 20:52.292
He killed her.

20:52.376 --> 20:54.544
He must have taken
one of my palette knives,

20:54.628 --> 20:55.671
but he was wearing gloves.

20:55.754 --> 20:57.881
That's why
my fingerprints are still on it.

20:57.965 --> 20:59.508
Anna, where's Buell right now?

21:01.260 --> 21:02.427
I don't know.

21:03.220 --> 21:05.514
Listen to me.
I want you to get out of there.

21:07.641 --> 21:09.309
<i>Anna, get the hell out of there!</i>

21:16.358 --> 21:17.484
Buell!

21:18.485 --> 21:19.695
No!

23:03.382 --> 23:04.383
