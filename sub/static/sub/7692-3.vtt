WEBVTT

00:08.542 --> 00:10.344
GUYS, WITH
THE DANCE COMING UP,

00:10.378 --> 00:12.012
I THOUGHT YOU
COULD USE A LESSON

00:12.046 --> 00:13.614
ON HOW TO ASK A LADY OUT.

00:13.647 --> 00:15.516
OH, GREAT. DO YOU KNOW
A GUY WHO CAN TEACH US?

00:15.549 --> 00:17.651
ME!

00:19.187 --> 00:23.091
YOU'RE GONNA WATCH ME
ASK OUT THE GIRL
OF MY DREAMS:

00:23.124 --> 00:24.525
DANIELLE.

00:24.558 --> 00:27.228
DANIELLE? ISN'T SHE
THE GIRL WHO USES YOU

00:27.261 --> 00:29.430
AS A FOOTSTOOL
IN MATH CLASS?

00:29.463 --> 00:32.366
WHERE ELSE IS SHE
SUPPOSED TO PUT HER
FEET-- ON THE FLOOR?!

00:34.402 --> 00:38.572
OPEN YOUR NOTEBOOKS, BOYS,
'CAUSE CLASS IS IN SESSION.

00:42.510 --> 00:43.811
HELLO, DANIELLE.

00:45.346 --> 00:48.416
DO YOU KNOW HOW MUCH
A POLAR BEAR WEIGHS?

00:48.449 --> 00:49.817
ENOUGH TO BREAK THE ICE.

00:52.420 --> 00:53.554
I'M LEO DOOLEY.

00:53.587 --> 00:55.323
DIDN'T YOU SEND ME
87 E-MAILS?

00:55.356 --> 00:58.592
YEAH. THAT WAS
A SLOW DAY.

00:59.693 --> 01:03.197
OKAY, WELL,
SEE YOU LATER, LENNY.

01:03.231 --> 01:05.299
IT'S LEO, BY THE WAY.

01:07.468 --> 01:11.038
SO, LEO... WHAT SHOULD I
WRITE DOWN IN MY NOTEBOOK?

01:11.071 --> 01:13.407
I MEAN,
OTHER THAN "DENIED."

01:13.441 --> 01:14.708
NO, NO, NO, YOU CAN
CHEAT OFF OF ME.

01:14.742 --> 01:17.211
I HAVE, "SHE'S NOT GOING
TO THE DANCE WITH LENNY."

01:19.247 --> 01:21.382
ARE YOU GUYS TALKING
ABOUT THE DANCE TOO?

01:21.415 --> 01:23.417
WHY IS EVERYBODY
MAKING SUCH A BIG DEAL

01:23.451 --> 01:25.586
OUT OF
THIS STUPID DANCE?

01:25.619 --> 01:27.588
NOBODY'S ASKED YOU YET,
HAVE THEY?

01:27.621 --> 01:30.424
NO!

01:30.458 --> 01:32.526
I REALLY WANT TO GO
WITH THAT GUY.

01:32.560 --> 01:34.195
HIS NAME IS ETHAN.

01:34.228 --> 01:36.230
WE SIT NEXT TO EACH
OTHER IN CHEMISTRY.

01:36.264 --> 01:38.199
COINCIDENCE?
I THINK NOT.

01:38.232 --> 01:39.567
* CHEMISTRY!

01:41.535 --> 01:42.670
WHAT SHOULD I DO?

01:42.703 --> 01:43.837
I GOT THIS.

01:49.843 --> 01:53.714
HE'S TALKING ABOUT A GIRL
HE THINKS IS CUTE.

01:53.747 --> 01:55.283
YEAH, BREE'S CUTE
AND I REALLY LIKE HER,

01:55.316 --> 01:58.152
BUT... I DON'T KNOW
HOW TO ASK HER OUT,
YOU KNOW?

01:58.186 --> 02:01.755
OOH! HE'S TALKING
ABOUT YOU!

02:01.789 --> 02:04.091
HE'S COMING OVER HERE
RIGHT NOW TO ASK YOU
TO THE DANCE.

02:04.124 --> 02:05.593
WHAT?! NO!

02:05.626 --> 02:08.295
NOW? WHY? REALLY?

02:08.329 --> 02:10.764
HOW'S IT GOING?

02:12.400 --> 02:13.601
ETHAN!

02:13.634 --> 02:15.303
WHAT A HUGE SURPRISE!

02:16.637 --> 02:18.105
TO SEE YOU HERE,

02:18.138 --> 02:20.341
FOR REASONS
WE DO NOT KNOW.

02:20.374 --> 02:22.443
HEY, ETHAN.

02:22.476 --> 02:24.512
HOW... UH, YOU KNOW...

02:24.545 --> 02:26.614
WE... UH, YOU KNOW...
DECIDED...

02:28.148 --> 02:30.218
WHAT IS THAT OVER THERE?

02:34.488 --> 02:35.756
WHERE'D SHE GO?

02:35.789 --> 02:37.791
UH, MORE IMPORTANTLY,

02:37.825 --> 02:39.427
WHAT IS THAT OVER THERE?

02:41.562 --> 02:44.665
Narrator:
 THE WORLD'S FIRST
 BIONIC SUPERHUMANS.

02:44.698 --> 02:46.634
THEY'RE STRONGER THAN US,

02:46.667 --> 02:48.736
FASTER, SMARTER--

02:48.769 --> 02:51.372
THE NEXT GENERATION
 OF THE HUMAN RACE IS...

02:51.405 --> 02:53.574
LIVING IN MY BASEMENT?

02:53.607 --> 02:56.744
**

03:01.815 --> 03:03.851
All: AAAAHHH!

03:36.550 --> 03:37.851
OKAY, YOU WIN.

03:40.688 --> 03:43.324
HEY, GUYS, I FINALLY
FIGURED IT OUT.

03:43.357 --> 03:44.358
OH, ME TOO!

03:44.392 --> 03:46.527
DO NOT EAT THE OUTSIDE
OF A PINEAPPLE.

03:46.560 --> 03:48.896
OOPH! THAT'LL
COME BACK TO HAUNT YOU!

03:50.498 --> 03:53.601
NO. I FIGURED OUT HOW
TO MAKE DANIELLE LIKE LEO.

03:53.634 --> 03:55.969
I RECORDED HER
WITH MY BIONIC HEARING.

03:56.003 --> 03:58.306
LET ME
PLAY IT BACK FOR YOU.

04:02.410 --> 04:04.678
Danielle: IN THE MOVIE,
 THE HERO PUNCHED THE BAD GUY

04:04.712 --> 04:07.381
AND STOLE THE BABY RIGHT
 OUT OF THE ALLIGATOR'S MOUTH.

04:07.415 --> 04:09.683
I WOULD SO GO OUT WITH
 A GUY LIKE THAT!

04:09.717 --> 04:11.218
PERFECT!
YOU GET THE ALLIGATOR,

04:11.251 --> 04:12.453
I'M GONNA GO
ROUND UP THAT BABY!

04:12.486 --> 04:15.789
ADAM, NO.

04:15.823 --> 04:17.224
SHE WANTS A HERO.

04:17.257 --> 04:19.493
WE JUST HAVE TO MAKE
LEO LOOK HEROIC.

04:19.527 --> 04:22.330
WELL, THAT'S A DEAD END.
WHAT ELSE SHALL WE DO TODAY?

04:25.533 --> 04:28.436
IF ONLY THERE WAS
A WAY YOU COULD BORROW
MY BIONIC STRENGTH.

04:28.469 --> 04:30.804
I CAN'T DO THAT.
THAT'S ALL YOU'VE GOT.

04:32.540 --> 04:35.609
WAIT A MINUTE--
ADAM'S ON TO SOMETHING,

04:35.643 --> 04:37.345
WHICH IS
QUITE AN ACHIEVEMENT

04:37.378 --> 04:38.579
FOR SOMEONE THAT
DOESN'T KNOW HOW
TO EAT A PINEAPPLE.

04:38.612 --> 04:41.482
HEY, I GOT IT DOWN,
DIDN'T I?

04:45.586 --> 04:46.887
( whistling )

04:46.920 --> 04:49.890
NNO, NO, NO, I'M GOOD.

04:49.923 --> 04:51.592
HTHANK YOU!

04:54.595 --> 04:56.864
OOH! THEY'RE COMING!
COMMENCE PHASE ONE

04:56.897 --> 04:58.999
OF OPERATION LADY FOR LEO.

05:00.601 --> 05:03.537
( stilted delivery ) OH, NO!
THIS MAN IS TRAPPED!

05:03.571 --> 05:06.807
HE LOOKS LIKE HE NEEDS
A HERO TO SAVE HIM.

05:07.975 --> 05:09.743
I WILL TAKE CHARGE

05:09.777 --> 05:12.480
AND HEROICALLY DO JUST THAT!

05:14.348 --> 05:15.583
( stilted delivery )
OH, NO!

05:15.616 --> 05:16.750
WE'RE RUNNING OUT OF TIME.

05:16.784 --> 05:18.586
SAVE ME BEFORE
THE ALLIGATOR COMES--

05:18.619 --> 05:19.687
( kicks lockers )

05:19.720 --> 05:21.789
Wrong rescue!

05:21.822 --> 05:24.358
I WILL LIFT
THESE LOCKERS!

05:24.392 --> 05:26.594
ONE... TWO... THREE!

05:28.762 --> 05:31.031
SO HEAVY!

05:31.064 --> 05:33.601
( gasping )

05:33.634 --> 05:36.904
YOU'RE A TRUE HEROIC
TAKE-CHARGE HERO!

05:36.937 --> 05:39.640
OH, MY GOSH!
I CAN'T BELIEVE
THAT JUST HAPPENED!

05:39.673 --> 05:44.311
YOU KNOW, IT TAKES A BIG MAN
TO DO SOMETHING LIKE--

05:44.344 --> 05:47.448
HOW ARE YOU NOT HURT?
YOU MUST BE SO STRONG.

05:47.481 --> 05:49.550
WAIT. WHAT? NO!

05:49.583 --> 05:52.052
HE'S NOT THE STRONG ONE;
I'M THE STRONG ONE!

05:52.085 --> 05:53.721
HERO!

05:55.423 --> 05:57.991
MAYBE I SHOULD WALK YOU
TO THE NURSES' OFFICE.

05:58.025 --> 05:59.593
W-WHAT ABOUT LEO?

05:59.627 --> 06:00.928
HE'S NOT HURT.

06:00.961 --> 06:03.531
LOOK AT ME!
I'M AN OPEN WOUND!

06:05.365 --> 06:06.700
REALLY, I-I'M FINE.

06:06.734 --> 06:08.836
OKAY, GOOD, 'CAUSE
THE DANCE IS SATURDAY,

06:08.869 --> 06:10.504
AND I LOVE DANCING.

06:10.538 --> 06:11.839
MAYBE WE CAN HANG OUT.

06:17.711 --> 06:19.413
GREAT PLAN, CHASE.

06:21.381 --> 06:22.583
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

06:22.616 --> 06:24.985
THAT DIDN'T GO
AT ALL LIKE WE
THOUGHT IT WOULD!

06:28.489 --> 06:29.990
YOU STOLE MY WOMAN!

06:30.023 --> 06:32.059
WHERE I COME FROM,
WE CALL THAT A LOVE CRIME.

06:32.092 --> 06:35.496
IT'S NOT MY FAULT
I LOOK BRAVE UNDER LOCKERS.

06:35.529 --> 06:37.531
I WAS TRYING TO HELP YOU.

06:37.565 --> 06:39.833
HOW? BY SAYING YOU'D GO
TO THE DANCE WITH HER?

06:39.867 --> 06:41.502
I'M KEEPING MY OPTIONS OPEN.

06:41.535 --> 06:43.136
IT'S THE FIRST TIME A GIRL'S
EVER BEEN INTERESTED IN ME,

06:43.170 --> 06:44.605
AND IT'S KIND OF NICE.

06:44.638 --> 06:46.874
"OOH! IT'S KIND OF NICE
'CAUSE SHE HAS--"

06:46.907 --> 06:49.810
( screaming )

06:49.843 --> 06:52.580
STOP IT, LITTLE MAN!
YOU'RE GONNA HURT YOURSELF!

06:52.613 --> 06:55.449
HEY, HEY, HEY! NO! HEY!

06:58.986 --> 07:02.723
GUYS, THIS IS
GETTING OUT OF HAND.

07:02.756 --> 07:05.025
IT'S LIKE WATCHING
A CHIHUAHUA FIGHT A HORSE.

07:06.827 --> 07:09.129
IS DANIELLE REALLY
WORTH ALL OF THIS?

07:09.162 --> 07:10.798
YES!

07:10.831 --> 07:14.568
ADAM, YOU CANNOT GO
TO THE DANCE WITH DANIELLE.

07:14.602 --> 07:16.570
IT WOULDN'T BE FAIR--
LEO WANTED HER FIRST!

07:16.604 --> 07:20.674
HEY, ALL IS FAIR IN LOVE
AND FAKE LOCKER ACCIDENTS.

07:22.676 --> 07:24.745
FINE. HE CAN HAVE HER.

07:24.778 --> 07:26.580
IT'S TOO LATE.

07:26.614 --> 07:28.616
THE DAMAGE IS DONE.

07:30.751 --> 07:33.621
I'LL NEVER LOVE AGAIN.

07:33.654 --> 07:36.123
LEO, I'LL TALK TO DANIELLE.

07:36.156 --> 07:38.125
I'LL CONVINCE HER THAT
ADAM'S NOT AN OPTION

07:38.158 --> 07:39.893
AND THAT SHE SHOULD
BE WITH YOU.

07:39.927 --> 07:42.095
YEAH, GO TO
THE DANCE WITH HER,

07:42.129 --> 07:44.965
BUT EVERYBODY'S GONNA
THINK YOU'RE DATING
YOUR BABYSITTER.

07:46.066 --> 07:48.802
( screaming )

07:50.804 --> 07:53.674
AH.

07:53.707 --> 07:57.911
WELL, IF IT ISN'T LITTLE
MISS FLASH AND SCRAM.

07:57.945 --> 08:01.782
HA HA. VERY FUNNY.

08:01.815 --> 08:03.450
I THINK
I SCARED ETHAN OFF.

08:03.483 --> 08:04.752
YA THINK?

08:04.785 --> 08:07.154
YOU LEFT SKID MARKS
IN THE HALLWAY.

08:08.756 --> 08:12.693
WELL, I THINK
THERE'S ONLY ONE
WAY TO FIX THIS--

08:12.726 --> 08:14.562
I HAVE TO ASK
 HIM TO THE DANCE.

08:14.595 --> 08:18.566
WELL, HERE'S YOUR CHANCE--
HE'S AT HIS LOCKER.

08:20.601 --> 08:23.704
UH, HEY, ETHAN,
COULD I TALK TO YOU
FOR A SECOND?

08:25.505 --> 08:27.040
OH, NO.

08:27.074 --> 08:31.111
I'VE GOT TO MAKE IT QUICK
'CAUSE I'M ON MY WAY TO--

08:33.547 --> 08:34.715
BREE?

08:34.748 --> 08:35.982
OVER HERE.

08:37.784 --> 08:39.687
BUT... YOU WERE...

08:39.720 --> 08:41.755
OKAY, WHY ARE YOU
UP THERE?

08:41.789 --> 08:44.725
YOU KNOW, JUST...
HELPING OUT THE JANITOR.

08:44.758 --> 08:47.561
I MEAN,
THIS PLACE IS "DUST-AY"!

08:53.801 --> 08:57.237
HEY, BREHORRIBLE.IT GOING?

08:57.270 --> 08:59.773
ETHAN WAS GONNA
ASK ME TO THE DANCE,

08:59.807 --> 09:02.610
BUT I GOT NERVOUS
AND RAN AWAY.

09:02.643 --> 09:05.879
EVERY TIME I SEE HIM,
I PANIC AND ACT LIKE
A TOTAL...

09:05.913 --> 09:07.715
DORK MONSTER?

09:07.748 --> 09:10.083
HUGE DORK MONSTER.

09:10.117 --> 09:12.552
LOOK, YOU ARE
NOT THE FIRST GIRL

09:12.586 --> 09:14.788
TO ACT WEIRD AROUND
A BOY SHE LIKES.

09:14.822 --> 09:17.691
I FLEW ACROSS THE ROOM
AND JUMPED ON TOP
OF THE LOCKERS.

09:17.725 --> 09:20.994
YEAH, THAT'S
PROBABLY A FIRST.

09:22.029 --> 09:23.697
WHENEVER HE'S AROUND,

09:23.731 --> 09:24.832
I GET ALL FLUSTERED
AND GLITCHY,

09:24.865 --> 09:26.166
AND I JUST WANT
TO EAT MY FACE

09:26.199 --> 09:27.801
SO I DON'T SAY
SOMETHING STUPID.

09:27.835 --> 09:31.972
HONEY, NEXT TIME
YOU SEE HIM,
JUST BREATHE!

09:32.005 --> 09:34.207
STAY IN THE MOMENT,
AND YOUR JITTERS
WILL GO AWAY.

09:34.241 --> 09:36.944
OR JUST WEAR HIGH HEELS.

09:36.977 --> 09:38.779
THAT WAY,
WHEN YOU RUN AWAY,

09:38.812 --> 09:41.782
YOU'LL WIPE OUT
LIKE A DOWNHILL SKIER.

09:44.652 --> 09:46.754
HI... DANIELLE?

09:46.787 --> 09:50.057
SORRY TO BARGE IN
ON YOUR GOSSIP SESSION

09:50.090 --> 09:53.661
THAT YOU MAY OR MAY NOT
HAVE BEEN HAVING.

09:54.995 --> 09:57.998
REMEMBER THAT GUY
WHO HEROICALLY LIFTED
A WALL OF LOCKERS?

09:58.031 --> 09:59.900
THE TALL,
GOOD-LOOKING GUY?

09:59.933 --> 10:03.904
NO, ACTUALLY, THE SMALLER,
MORE INTERESTING-LOOKING GUY.

10:03.937 --> 10:07.240
OH! MY STURDY
LITTLE FOOTSTOOL!

10:08.308 --> 10:09.677
BINGO!

10:10.878 --> 10:14.014
ANYWAY, I KNOW
YOU LIKE MY BROTHER ADAM,

10:14.047 --> 10:17.885
AND THAT'S CREATING
A PROBLEM IN HIS
FRIENDSHIP WITH LEO,

10:17.918 --> 10:22.723
SO I WAS KINDA HOPING
THAT MAYBE YOU'D GO TO
THE DANCE WITH LEO INSTEAD.

10:22.756 --> 10:24.024
OH, THAT IS SO SWEET!

10:24.057 --> 10:25.893
YOU'RE WORRIED
ABOUT YOUR FRIEND!

10:25.926 --> 10:28.762
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I KNOW HOW TO FIX
THIS WHOLE THING.

10:28.796 --> 10:31.064
SEE? I KNEW THAT IF
I JUST TALKED TO YOU,

10:31.098 --> 10:32.800
EVERYTHING WOULD WORK OUT.

10:32.833 --> 10:35.402
SURE DID. I'M GONNA GO
TO THE DANCE WITH YOU!

10:36.770 --> 10:38.238
SEE YOU THERE, CUTEY!

10:42.876 --> 10:45.278
( gasps )
HI!

10:45.312 --> 10:47.047
GUYS!

10:47.080 --> 10:50.050
SO... HERE'S THE DEAL.

10:50.083 --> 10:52.753
DANIELLE'S NOT GOING
TO THE DANCE WITH
EITHER OF YOU.

10:52.786 --> 10:54.722
WHAT?! WHO'S
SHE GOING WITH?

10:55.789 --> 10:57.858
ME!

11:07.835 --> 11:10.771
HOW COULD YOU
SWIPE DANIELLE AWAY
FROM BOTH OF US?

11:10.804 --> 11:13.073
I DIDN'T
SWIPE HER AWAY, OKAY?

11:13.106 --> 11:15.809
SHE JUST KIND OF FELL
IN MY LAP LIKE A BEAUTIFUL,

11:15.843 --> 11:17.811
FLOWERY ANGEL FROM HEAVEN--

11:17.845 --> 11:20.413
WE GET IT!

11:20.447 --> 11:22.415
LOOK, I DIDN'T MEAN
FOR THIS TO HAPPEN.

11:22.449 --> 11:24.785
OH, SO YOU'RE NOT
TAKING HER TO THE DANCE?

11:24.818 --> 11:27.120
OF COURSE I'M TAKING HER
TO THE DANCE.

11:27.154 --> 11:30.690
SHE'S LIKE A COTTONY-WHITE LAMB
WHO FROLICS IN A--

11:30.724 --> 11:32.192
WE GET IT!

11:34.227 --> 11:35.729
I MAY NOT KNOW
ANY DANCE MOVES,

11:35.763 --> 11:38.065
BUT A GIRL IS INTERESTED
IN ME FOR THE FIRST TIME EVER.

11:38.098 --> 11:39.767
HOW CAN I SAY NO TO THAT?

11:39.800 --> 11:43.670
OH, YOU SAY NO.
"N-O-O" NO!

11:43.703 --> 11:46.874
WHATEVER HAPPENED TO,
"IT'S NOT FAIR.
LEO HAD HER FIRST"?

11:46.907 --> 11:48.208
OKAY, YOU SAY
NOT TO DO SOMETHING,

11:48.241 --> 11:49.743
AND YOU DO

15:15.615 --> 15:17.117

15:17.150 --> 15:18.618
THEN YOU JUMP
ON TOP OF THE LOCKERS,

15:18.651 --> 15:20.954
AND THEN YOU TRAP ME
