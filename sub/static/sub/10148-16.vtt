WEBVTT

01:09.445 --> 01:10.988
Let me see if I got all this.

01:11.322 --> 01:13.574
Jurgen is breaking up with Blade
so he can see Chris.

01:13.658 --> 01:16.244
But Chris is interested in Eric,
who doesn't wanna date anybody.

01:16.702 --> 01:18.722
Now, wait a minute.
That doesn't sound like Eric to me.

01:18.746 --> 01:20.539
<i>It's not.
You're thinking of the other Eric.</i>

01:20.957 --> 01:22.277
Oh, man, there's two of them now?

01:22.541 --> 01:24.502
See how important
these little updates are?

01:24.585 --> 01:25.979
Without them,
people would start wondering

01:26.003 --> 01:28.130
why you don't know
what's going on at school any more.

01:28.214 --> 01:31.467
<i>I should just tell them I'm busy chasing
renegade synthoids and living heads.</i>

01:31.717 --> 01:33.719
- They wouldn't believe it.
- Neither do I.

01:34.512 --> 01:35.512
Hold on.

01:37.974 --> 01:38.974
Somebody's in a hurry.

02:02.248 --> 02:04.125
- This'll stop them.
<i>- Stop who?</i>

02:05.084 --> 02:06.084
Gonna find out.

02:24.770 --> 02:25.770
Got them.

02:31.527 --> 02:34.113
Ter... I mean, Batman,
who was in such a big hurry?

02:39.493 --> 02:41.996
- It's Sean Miller.
- Sean Miller?

02:42.413 --> 02:44.373
Yeah, from our history class.

02:48.794 --> 02:50.588
An out-of-control child.

02:51.005 --> 02:52.840
A parent's worst nightmare.

02:53.257 --> 02:56.052
I'm Dr. David Wheeler,
child psychologist.

02:56.469 --> 03:00.014
With the tough new parental
liability laws now in effect,

03:00.097 --> 03:04.143
mothers and fathers can no longer afford
to ignore their children's problems.

03:04.727 --> 03:06.228
<i>Are they staying out too late?</i>

03:07.229 --> 03:08.773
<i>Ignoring their schoolwork?</i>

03:11.067 --> 03:13.611
<i>Or are they involved in something worse?</i>

03:14.153 --> 03:16.113
Whatever the problem is, I can help.

03:16.197 --> 03:18.699
<i>At my ranch,
only minutes from Gotham City</i>

03:18.949 --> 03:22.244
<i>I offer the very finest
long-term therapy for adolescents.</i>

03:22.578 --> 03:24.413
Yes, it is expensive.

03:24.663 --> 03:26.415
But think about the alternative.

03:30.086 --> 03:31.796
It's getting to be a ghost town in here.

03:32.129 --> 03:33.255
Cold and flu season?

03:34.215 --> 03:35.966
More like Dr. Wheeler
and that ranch of his.

03:36.592 --> 03:38.135
All this? Come on, Chels.

03:38.302 --> 03:40.221
Come on, yourself.
The parents are scared.

03:40.304 --> 03:42.532
They're sending their kids
off to therapy by the busload.

03:42.556 --> 03:43.474
As if they needed it.

03:43.557 --> 03:45.559
Sean needed it. Lots and lots of it.

03:45.976 --> 03:47.645
Yeah, but what about Alexa and Jamal?

03:47.728 --> 03:48.729
And Adam Stepnik?

03:49.105 --> 03:50.356
Adam got sent away?

03:50.606 --> 03:52.166
But he makes those beautiful paintings.

03:52.400 --> 03:54.735
Except sometimes he uses
other people's walls.

03:54.819 --> 03:57.696
Well, I guess if a kid's parents
want him to get therapy,

03:57.780 --> 03:59.365
it's not like we can do anything.

03:59.865 --> 04:01.951
Speak for yourself.
I'm gonna e-mail the principal.

04:02.034 --> 04:03.034
Rattle his cage.

04:03.452 --> 04:04.495
Careful, Chels.

04:04.662 --> 04:06.182
Hey, it's like a letter to the editor.

04:06.288 --> 04:07.568
My dad writes them all the time.

04:25.224 --> 04:26.225
Hello.

04:31.063 --> 04:32.523
Well, thank you for telling me.

04:32.731 --> 04:33.731
Good night.

04:35.568 --> 04:36.568
Chelsea.

04:41.198 --> 04:42.867
The e-mail must have been
the last straw.

04:42.950 --> 04:45.578
I knew her dad had issues with her,
but I didn't think...

04:45.828 --> 04:48.289
He probably figured
the ranch would straighten her out.

04:48.581 --> 04:49.832
Straighten her out?

04:49.957 --> 04:50.875
How could anyone think

04:50.958 --> 04:53.502
Chelsea deserves to be in the same place
as a kid like Sean?

04:53.586 --> 04:54.837
I got another one for you.

04:55.087 --> 04:57.756
What kind of place would admit
a normal kid like Chelsea?

04:58.257 --> 04:59.467
Makes you wonder, doesn't it?

05:00.634 --> 05:02.386
Somebody should look into that ranch.

05:04.138 --> 05:05.138
Yeah.

05:06.474 --> 05:07.474
Somebody.

05:22.031 --> 05:23.031
Chelsea.

05:23.324 --> 05:25.159
I never expected to see you here.

05:25.242 --> 05:26.452
Now there's a coincidence,

05:26.535 --> 05:28.329
'cause I never expected
to be here, Sean.

05:28.621 --> 05:30.748
Yeah, you were always
one of the good ones, Chelsea.

05:30.998 --> 05:32.791
Good grades, good manners.

05:33.375 --> 05:35.794
Except, you were always
talking about me behind my back.

05:35.878 --> 05:37.922
I never talked about you, ever.

05:38.797 --> 05:40.216
Well, that's even worse, isn't it?

05:42.009 --> 05:43.802
Excuse me, Sean. I see an old friend.

05:47.223 --> 05:49.558
Adam, it's so good
to see a familiar face.

05:51.769 --> 05:52.769
Adam?

05:56.607 --> 05:58.817
Adam's not going to be saying much
for a while.

05:58.901 --> 05:59.777
Why not?

05:59.860 --> 06:01.028
'Cause of the ISO.

06:01.487 --> 06:03.280
The ISO? What's that?

06:03.906 --> 06:04.907
All right, everybody.

06:05.533 --> 06:06.534
Time for class.

06:11.997 --> 06:13.541
Class? Here?

06:13.749 --> 06:14.875
You'll see.

06:34.562 --> 06:36.939
<i>Easiest thing</i>
in the <i>world,</i> being a teenager.

06:37.022 --> 06:39.775
<i>You get up, you go to school,
you come home,</i>

06:39.858 --> 06:41.151
<i>and you do your homework.</i>

06:41.485 --> 06:42.945
<i>How do you mess that up?</i>

06:43.487 --> 06:45.990
<i>Yet all of you did,
in one way or another.</i>

06:46.073 --> 06:48.284
<i>And now I have to clean up that mess.</i>

06:49.868 --> 06:52.204
<i>He 's been going on
like this for hours</i>

06:52.288 --> 06:53.789
<i>telling them how worthless they are</i>

06:54.039 --> 06:55.457
<i>and how only he can help them.</i>

06:55.916 --> 06:57.585
<i>He won't even let them
go to the bathroom.</i>

06:57.876 --> 07:00.129
Sleep deprivation, endless harangues.

07:00.212 --> 07:02.631
It's classic brainwashing.
Some cults do it.

07:02.715 --> 07:05.092
<i>It's also occasionally used
on prisoners of war.</i>

07:05.175 --> 07:07.094
And Wheeler's doing it to kids.

07:07.469 --> 07:08.469
Wait a minute.

07:09.805 --> 07:11.074
Somebody's trying to say something.

07:11.098 --> 07:13.726
Dr. Wheeler, could I go back to my room?

07:14.310 --> 07:17.271
It's so late.
I can hardly keep my eyes open.

07:17.354 --> 07:20.024
<i>No. You need to listen to this,
all of you.</i>

07:20.107 --> 07:21.942
<i>And I've got lots more to say.</i>

07:22.026 --> 07:23.068
<i>Hours more.</i>

07:23.402 --> 07:24.445
Please!

07:24.528 --> 07:25.528
<i>Vincent.</i>

07:29.199 --> 07:30.409
Take him to the ISO.

07:31.660 --> 07:33.829
The ISO? No, please!

07:33.912 --> 07:35.706
I'll be good, I promise.

07:35.789 --> 07:36.790
Please, no!

07:59.355 --> 08:00.856
- He's up there.
- Up there.

08:15.496 --> 08:16.496
I see him.

09:01.125 --> 09:02.126
<i>Target acquired.</i>

09:17.182 --> 09:18.451
What do we need more evidence for?

09:18.475 --> 09:20.602
You taped the feed
from my fingertip mics, didn't you?

09:21.812 --> 09:23.289
All you gotta do
is take it to the authorities.

09:23.313 --> 09:25.274
And what do I say
when they ask me where I got it?

09:25.649 --> 09:27.568
A little bat left it on my front porch?

09:28.152 --> 09:29.152
Oh.

09:31.822 --> 09:33.382
You still got that plastic minivid cam?

09:33.657 --> 09:35.051
The one you can take
through a metal detector?

09:35.075 --> 09:36.910
I've got it,
but you're not thinking of-

09:36.994 --> 09:38.662
Some jobs are just too tough for Batman.

09:39.079 --> 09:41.165
That's when Terry McGinnis
swings into action.

09:49.256 --> 09:51.216
McGinnis.
Here to see Chelsea Cunningham.

09:51.550 --> 09:52.550
The backpack.

09:53.302 --> 09:54.136
What for?

09:54.219 --> 09:56.054
Visitors aren't allowed
to bring in anything.

09:57.389 --> 09:58.515
Let me put it this way.

09:58.599 --> 10:01.477
You don't give me that backpack,
you don't get in.

10:02.102 --> 10:03.270
What's in there, anyway?

10:03.645 --> 10:04.897
Your security blanket?

10:04.980 --> 10:06.190
Something like that...

10:07.858 --> 10:08.858
Vincent.

10:23.165 --> 10:24.166
I know it's tough.

10:24.249 --> 10:27.544
It's been tough on all of us, too,
but you gotta stick it out.

10:27.628 --> 10:28.628
Your father's right.

10:30.464 --> 10:31.464
Listen.

10:32.633 --> 10:34.009
I don't wanna listen!

10:36.136 --> 10:37.221
Where's Chelsea Cunningham?

10:37.471 --> 10:39.640
She canceled.
Didn't wanna see anyone today.

10:39.723 --> 10:41.785
There's gotta be a mistake.
I just made the appointment.

10:41.809 --> 10:43.185
- No mistake.
- But...

10:43.268 --> 10:44.520
I'm getting out of here!

10:44.853 --> 10:46.730
Donny, don't. Please.

10:47.481 --> 10:49.566
You're only making it worse.

11:19.763 --> 11:20.763
Chels.

11:21.723 --> 11:22.723
Terry?

11:26.353 --> 11:27.354
What happened to you?

11:27.688 --> 11:29.189
I haven't been sleeping much.

11:29.273 --> 11:30.625
Is this why you didn't wanna see me?

11:30.649 --> 11:32.276
Terry, I did wanna see you.

11:32.359 --> 11:34.319
- They told me you canceled.
- But-

11:34.403 --> 11:36.738
Listen, there's a lot of weird stuff
going on here.

11:36.822 --> 11:38.532
I know. Hold on a second.

11:41.743 --> 11:42.578
Okay, go.

11:42.661 --> 11:44.496
The sleep thing's
just the beginning, Terry.

11:45.163 --> 11:47.708
He's trying to break our will,
turn us all into little robots.

11:47.958 --> 11:50.377
Wheeler's got this thing they call ISO.

11:50.627 --> 11:52.129
Short for "isolation."

11:52.546 --> 11:55.924
It's total sense deprivation.
No light, no sound.

11:56.341 --> 11:59.011
He uses it on the kids
who don't get with the program.

11:59.761 --> 12:01.471
It... It...

12:02.389 --> 12:03.974
Terry, you've gotta get me out of here.

12:05.392 --> 12:06.602
That's gonna happen, Chels.

12:06.977 --> 12:08.854
Just as soon as
someone I know sees this vid.

12:09.187 --> 12:12.316
In the meantime, just try to stay schway
for another day or two, okay?

12:14.443 --> 12:15.443
L'll try.

12:27.873 --> 12:28.873
McGinnis!

12:30.417 --> 12:31.418
Come to see me?

12:31.501 --> 12:32.501
Afraid not, Sean.

12:32.544 --> 12:34.379
Don't you wanna talk about the old days?

12:34.713 --> 12:36.840
Like, say, that fight we had
back in seventh grade?

12:37.382 --> 12:39.635
Ah, I remember it real well, Terry.

12:40.052 --> 12:42.220
The way you and the others
were always laughing at me.

12:42.554 --> 12:43.554
Sean, you're...

12:43.889 --> 12:45.140
I don't have time for this now.

12:49.227 --> 12:50.604
I got the time.

13:03.408 --> 13:04.660
What do you think you're doing?

13:07.788 --> 13:09.414
We were just talking, that's all.

13:13.877 --> 13:14.920
Just talking, huh?

13:15.963 --> 13:16.963
He started it.

13:17.339 --> 13:18.339
Liar.

13:18.882 --> 13:20.384
I'm afraid I have to agree.

13:22.469 --> 13:23.469
Dr. Wheeler.

13:23.679 --> 13:25.847
You know me.
I don't get into fights anymore.

13:25.931 --> 13:27.182
Do I know you, Sean?

13:27.432 --> 13:28.432
L thought I did.

13:28.642 --> 13:32.020
But now I think you were just
pretending to go along with the program.

13:32.396 --> 13:34.106
No, I was into it. Really.

13:36.525 --> 13:37.901
ISO, first thing in the morning.

13:38.276 --> 13:40.070
ISO? You can't.

13:40.320 --> 13:43.573
Sony, Sean.
It's time you made some real progress.

13:43.657 --> 13:45.075
You do this, I'll get you.

13:45.158 --> 13:46.159
I swear.

13:46.952 --> 13:47.995
I swear!

13:49.997 --> 13:52.416
Now, then. Mr. McGinnis, is it?

13:52.916 --> 13:54.292
What were you doing back here?

13:54.793 --> 13:56.211
Just looking for a bathroom.

13:56.503 --> 13:57.546
That's when he jumped me.

13:57.879 --> 13:59.214
We know each other from school.

13:59.297 --> 14:00.674
Weren't what you'd call "close."

14:02.426 --> 14:03.426
Pat him down.

14:04.428 --> 14:05.554
Hey!

14:06.096 --> 14:07.176
What do you think you're...

14:11.059 --> 14:12.059
What's this for?

14:12.269 --> 14:13.269
Home movies?

14:16.481 --> 14:19.067
<i>He's trying to break our will,
turn us all into little robots.</i>

14:21.111 --> 14:22.237
Whose idea was this?

14:26.616 --> 14:27.617
Lock him in a room.

14:27.701 --> 14:29.244
Hey, you can't do this.

14:29.327 --> 14:30.620
Stop! Let go!

14:30.996 --> 14:33.915
This whole place is gonna crash
when the parents find out about you.

14:38.920 --> 14:39.920
What's next?

14:40.714 --> 14:43.467
Hold McGinnis overnight.
See if anyone comes looking for him.

14:43.550 --> 14:44.593
And if they do?

14:44.926 --> 14:46.553
We destroy his vid disc,

14:46.762 --> 14:48.555
and it'll be my word against his.

14:48.847 --> 14:50.432
And what if no one comes?

14:50.640 --> 14:53.852
In that case,
we'll put a more permanent end to this.

14:59.274 --> 15:01.860
So, how do you want me
to get rid of the McGinnis kid?'

15:01.943 --> 15:04.112
The road through the forest
winds pretty badly.

15:04.488 --> 15:07.157
Sometimes trees come at you
from out of nowhere.

15:07.491 --> 15:09.910
And you know how little protection
those cycles give.

15:10.577 --> 15:12.412
It won't be easy. The kid's a fighter.

15:12.496 --> 15:14.456
Then we'll just have to take
the fight out of him.

15:14.706 --> 15:16.416
Give him ISO in the morning, too.

15:29.179 --> 15:30.179
Hey, shut up.

15:30.472 --> 15:32.099
Got some news for you, McGinnis.

15:32.808 --> 15:35.060
Word is, I'm not going to ISO alone.

15:37.479 --> 15:38.522
No comment, huh?

15:39.397 --> 15:41.149
Maybe neither of us will have to go.

15:41.691 --> 15:44.277
Sony, fool.
Wheeler doesn't change his mind.

15:44.569 --> 15:46.738
- He won't have to.
- What are you talking about?

15:46.822 --> 15:49.199
Something neither of us
has ever been very good at.

15:49.574 --> 15:50.574
Cooperation.

15:50.742 --> 15:51.743
Cooperate?

15:52.119 --> 15:52.953
With you?

15:53.036 --> 15:54.871
[Uaughs]

15:55.330 --> 15:57.457
If I get out of here,
there are people I can go to,

15:57.541 --> 15:59.000
people who'll shut this place down.

15:59.626 --> 16:01.186
But I can't get out unless you help me.

16:01.545 --> 16:03.463
What do I care if they close the ranch?

16:03.547 --> 16:05.147
They'll just put me in some other place.

16:05.423 --> 16:08.093
No. This is your chance to prove
they're wrong about you.

16:08.385 --> 16:09.761
Maybe your last chance.

16:49.926 --> 16:52.512
Just think of it as
a whole lot of peace and quiet.

16:52.596 --> 16:54.181
All at once.

16:55.807 --> 16:58.602
You two go quietly,
we might let you out a little early.

17:22.626 --> 17:23.626
Come on.

17:26.546 --> 17:27.756
The master key card.

17:34.221 --> 17:35.221
Hey!

17:36.723 --> 17:38.058
They're cutoff. Get them.

17:44.648 --> 17:46.858
- There's no way out.
- Sure there is.

17:57.327 --> 17:58.787
All we need is a little distraction.

17:59.704 --> 18:00.704
Hey!

18:04.584 --> 18:05.877
I thought you wanted to get out.

18:05.961 --> 18:07.504
- You go.
- Okay.

18:41.913 --> 18:42.913
Look out.

19:02.017 --> 19:03.476
Sean, please. Please.

19:04.561 --> 19:06.521
Don't do it, please.

19:06.604 --> 19:08.481
You were gonna give me ISO.

19:09.983 --> 19:11.943
- No.
- Stay out of this.

19:12.360 --> 19:13.570
You made your point.

19:13.903 --> 19:16.031
This place has crashed,
and Wheeler's going to jail.

19:16.489 --> 19:17.489
I don't care.

19:17.824 --> 19:19.326
The only reason I went along with it

19:19.409 --> 19:21.369
was 'cause I was hoping
I'd get a chance for this.

19:21.578 --> 19:22.579
Don't you get it?

19:22.787 --> 19:24.914
You helped save everybody.
You're a hero now.

19:24.998 --> 19:26.166
A hero?

20:09.417 --> 20:11.336
I got worried when you didn't come back.

20:11.669 --> 20:13.671
Bet you brought
one of your old bat suits with you.

20:13.880 --> 20:14.923
You'll never know.

20:16.132 --> 20:18.134
I hope you don't think
this place was typical.

20:18.385 --> 20:19.385
No.

20:19.636 --> 20:21.096
But I sure wish we didn't need them.

20:21.471 --> 20:22.471
I know.

20:27.894 --> 20:28.894
I know.
