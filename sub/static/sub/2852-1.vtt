01:23.400 --> 01:25.600
Oh. Fuck.

01:25.700 --> 01:28.200
Sir, you were driving
erratically back there.

01:28.300 --> 01:29.300
I'm gonna be honest
with you, ok.

01:29.400 --> 01:31.100
I kind of got swept up
in the music and...

01:31.200 --> 01:33.900
You know, I got swept up.
I was swept. I got swept up.

01:34.800 --> 01:36.000
Sir, step out of the car.

01:36.100 --> 01:38.100
Have you ever performed
a field sobriety test?

01:38.200 --> 01:39.400
What?

01:39.500 --> 01:41.500
Just put one foot
in front of the other.

01:41.600 --> 01:44.000
- Yeah.
- Heel-to-toe, for nine steps.

01:46.900 --> 01:49.400
One foot and extend
your arms to the side.

01:49.500 --> 01:51.600
Can you do that?

01:52.800 --> 01:54.600
I'm sober!
I can't do it!

01:54.700 --> 01:56.100
No shaking.

01:57.800 --> 01:59.000
Look, this is not easy.

01:59.100 --> 02:00.200
You can do it
'cause you've practiced.

02:00.300 --> 02:02.300
- Come with me.
- What?

02:02.400 --> 02:04.100
Sir, you are clearly
intoxicated.

02:04.200 --> 02:06.200
I'm not! I wasn't drinking.
I was just happy.

02:06.300 --> 02:08.199
Is that the penalty
for being happy?

02:08.300 --> 02:11.000
Oh, the head, the head,
the precious head.

02:11.100 --> 02:12.900
Don't hurt the head.

02:30.900 --> 02:32.300
- Hey, Nathan.
- Hey, Ben.

02:32.400 --> 02:33.400
How are you, man?

02:33.500 --> 02:36.400
What a fucked up morning I had.

02:36.500 --> 02:38.300
- Today? This morning?
- Yeah, this morning.

02:38.400 --> 02:39.600
Unbelievable.

02:39.700 --> 02:41.700
Hey, did you hear haney's
gonna use one of my ideas

02:41.800 --> 02:43.100
in the big presentation today.

02:43.200 --> 02:44.700
- Is that right?
- Yeah, how about that, huh?

02:44.800 --> 02:46.400
- Congratulations.
- Thank you very much.

02:46.400 --> 02:48.100
Your mother must be
so proud of you.

02:48.200 --> 02:51.800
- Well...
- "Ben got something in the presentation."

02:51.900 --> 02:54.200
- "We're so proud of him."
- It's... yeah.

02:54.300 --> 02:56.100
- "Did you hear?"
- I hope haney likes it.

02:56.200 --> 02:58.000
Did you see? His son
is in the office today.

02:58.100 --> 02:59.400
- Is that right?
- Yeah, Howard.

02:59.500 --> 03:01.300
He named his son
after Howard roark

03:01.400 --> 03:03.500
from ayn rand's the fountainhead.

03:03.600 --> 03:05.700
- Howard roark.
- Oh, I never read it.

03:05.800 --> 03:07.600
As far as I'm concerned,
he's the biggest asshole

03:07.700 --> 03:09.600
in the history of literature,
and then you name your kid...

03:09.700 --> 03:11.300
- Why would you do that?
- Oh Jesus.

03:11.400 --> 03:13.900
- Are you all right down there?
- This just drives me crazy.

03:14.000 --> 03:14.900
What?

03:15.000 --> 03:16.400
I'm sick of these outlets

03:16.500 --> 03:17.900
always on the floor.

03:18.000 --> 03:20.000
Every time I try
and plug something in,

03:20.100 --> 03:23.400
I have to move furniture,
and I strain my back.

03:23.500 --> 03:25.600
Why can't outlets be up here?

03:25.700 --> 03:28.000
- At eye level.
- Eye level?

03:28.100 --> 03:29.400
What are they, like genitals?

03:29.500 --> 03:31.000
We have to hide them?

03:31.100 --> 03:32.500
Why are we hiding outlets?

03:32.600 --> 03:34.400
- Think about it.
- Yeah. It's a...

03:34.500 --> 03:36.000
- Oh. See you later.
- Ok.

03:36.100 --> 03:37.500
Good to see you, boss.
Good luck today.

03:37.600 --> 03:39.100
Hey. Ben, how are you?
Where you been?

03:39.200 --> 03:42.100
I had a little
problem this morning.

03:42.200 --> 03:44.600
- It's... crazy.
- Big day today.

03:44.700 --> 03:46.200
Sorry. Sorry I'm late.

03:46.300 --> 03:48.000
Ok.

03:48.100 --> 03:50.000
Is that new?

03:50.100 --> 03:52.100
No. I've had it
for a while.

03:52.200 --> 03:54.700
That's a plepler,
he paints shopping carts.

03:54.800 --> 03:57.700
As a kid, I was fascinated
by shopping carts

03:57.800 --> 03:59.800
because you get to drive
them in the supermarket.

03:59.800 --> 04:00.900
It's quite beautiful.

04:01.000 --> 04:02.300
I can't believe I never
noticed that before.

04:02.400 --> 04:05.100
Something about the shopping
cart I find mesmerizing.

04:05.200 --> 04:06.600
Hey, look who's here!

04:06.700 --> 04:09.600
Hi, buddy. How ya doing?
How are you doing?

04:09.700 --> 04:11.200
You wanna meet Mr. flomm?

04:11.300 --> 04:12.400
- Hello. Hi.
- Hi.

04:12.500 --> 04:14.500
Nathan, this is my son, Howard.

04:14.600 --> 04:16.500
- Hello.
- This is our nanny, marina.

04:16.600 --> 04:17.800
Marina, this is Nathan flomm.

04:17.899 --> 04:19.300
- Nice to meet you.
- Hi, nice to meet you.

04:19.399 --> 04:23.200
I like that, that swirl
you got on your hair there.

04:23.300 --> 04:24.700
Thank you.
It takes a few hours.

04:24.800 --> 04:26.700
Huh? It takes
a few hours.

04:26.800 --> 04:28.700
What do you do
about the shampooing?

04:28.800 --> 04:30.900
Once a week.

04:31.000 --> 04:33.300
- You shampoo once a week.
- Once a week when I do it.

04:33.400 --> 04:36.200
You may wanna consider
going twice, you know.

04:36.300 --> 04:38.700
That's a long time
to go without shampooing.

04:38.800 --> 04:39.900
But this takes two hours.

04:40.000 --> 04:41.700
Try a second shampoo.

04:41.800 --> 04:43.700
Take a little tip, little tip.

04:43.800 --> 04:44.800
He's a full-time job.

04:44.900 --> 04:47.000
She's a very valuable member
of our family.

04:47.100 --> 04:48.800
Wonderful caregiver.

04:48.900 --> 04:50.100
Will you do me a favor
and take Howard out

04:50.200 --> 04:51.800
to the front desk
and wait for me there.

04:51.800 --> 04:53.400
You need to get in there.

04:53.500 --> 04:54.700
I wanna say good-bye
before he goes to school.

04:54.800 --> 04:56.600
I'm... every day.

04:56.700 --> 04:58.400
Ok, buddy. Will you wait
for me out there?

04:58.500 --> 04:59.600
- Ok.
- All right.

04:59.700 --> 05:01.500
Bye. Nice to meet you.

05:01.600 --> 05:03.400
Love you.

05:03.500 --> 05:05.000
Isn't he cute?

05:05.100 --> 05:07.800
She's shampooing once a week,
are you kidding me.

05:09.600 --> 05:11.800
Congratulations to Andy matsin.

05:11.900 --> 05:15.000
Good job. Also to mark
and his aerodynamics team

05:15.100 --> 05:17.800
for perfecting the
exterior profile of the car

05:17.900 --> 05:19.700
and reducing
the drag coefficient

05:19.800 --> 05:22.200
to a very slippery 0.23.

05:22.300 --> 05:25.400
Very good job, mark.

05:25.500 --> 05:27.200
So I've answered all the
tough questions about the car.

05:27.300 --> 05:29.600
Is it safer?
Is it more efficient?

05:29.700 --> 05:32.300
Can it travel further
on a single charge

05:32.400 --> 05:35.300
than any other production
electric vehicle out there?

05:35.400 --> 05:38.500
Yes, yes, and yes.

05:38.600 --> 05:40.900
So there's probably
one more question

05:41.000 --> 05:43.300
that you all have.

05:43.500 --> 05:45.700
What's the name?

05:45.800 --> 05:49.300
What are we gonna call
this bold new vision?

05:49.400 --> 05:52.700
It's a name that instantly
defines our product.

05:52.800 --> 05:54.400
Ladies and gentlemen...

05:56.600 --> 05:58.500
The Howard.

05:58.600 --> 06:02.100
Brilliant.

06:02.200 --> 06:06.300
- Are you kidding?
- Thank you very much.

06:06.400 --> 06:10.000
The Howard? Honestly?
That's what we're calling this?

06:10.100 --> 06:11.300
Yes.

06:11.400 --> 06:14.500
I'm sorry. I got a real problem
with this name, man.

06:14.600 --> 06:18.000
- Oh God, Nathan.
- Howard? You can't...

06:18.100 --> 06:20.500
You can't call a car Howard.

06:20.600 --> 06:22.800
Come on. Seriously.

06:22.900 --> 06:25.700
I tell you what. Everybody,
let's reconvene in 15.

06:25.800 --> 06:27.600
Nathan and I are gonna
have a quick discussion

06:27.700 --> 06:30.500
about the marketing of this.
Let's move forward.

06:30.600 --> 06:32.700
- Do you like this name?
- It's a great name.

06:32.800 --> 06:35.200
Grab that door
on your way out. Hey.

06:37.300 --> 06:39.100
All right.
Let me just say this, ok.

06:39.200 --> 06:40.500
You brought me
into this company

06:40.600 --> 06:41.900
for my marketing
expertise, correct?

06:42.000 --> 06:43.700
- Yes.
- Ok.

06:43.800 --> 06:46.500
I hate to toot my own horn,
but you know I was the brains

06:46.600 --> 06:48.000
behind the edible arrangements,

06:48.100 --> 06:51.800
1,030 percent growth
in three fiscal quarters.

06:51.900 --> 06:53.500
- I'm aware.
- I'm not making that up.

06:53.600 --> 06:55.000
Call Patrick lyons,
he'll tell you...

06:55.100 --> 06:57.200
Nathan, I'm aware
of your success.

06:57.300 --> 06:58.500
It's why we hired you.

06:58.600 --> 07:00.800
Ok. You're making
it impossible

07:00.900 --> 07:03.000
for me to market this car.
I can't do it.

07:03.100 --> 07:04.900
Nobody's gonna buy a car
named Howard.

07:05.000 --> 07:07.100
It's like naming
a restaurant hepatitis.

07:07.300 --> 07:08.600
- It's a name.
- It's not a good name.

07:08.700 --> 07:10.700
Call it a Dewey.
That's a good name.

07:10.800 --> 07:12.900
- A Duncan. Call it Duncan.
- Nathan,

07:13.000 --> 07:15.100
your job is to come up
with the marketing.

07:15.200 --> 07:17.600
Marketers market.
Inventors invent.

07:17.700 --> 07:18.900
It's a slam-dunk.

07:19.000 --> 07:20.400
By the way, what happened
to the pee flap?

07:20.500 --> 07:22.700
The pee flap...
Nathan, are you still

07:22.800 --> 07:25.400
on this horrible idea,
the pee flap?

07:25.500 --> 07:28.500
- I thought you were into it?
- It's an insane idea.

07:28.600 --> 07:30.200
Everybody wants to pee
in their car.

07:30.300 --> 07:31.900
Nobody wants to pee
in their car.

07:32.000 --> 07:32.900
I wanna pee in my car.

07:33.000 --> 07:34.300
You'd get pee
all over yourself.

07:34.400 --> 07:36.200
No, the tube comes up
high enough

07:36.300 --> 07:37.800
that it will catch everything.

07:37.900 --> 07:40.600
Nathan, everybody's different.
How big is the tube?

07:40.700 --> 07:42.300
You put your balls
and your penis in the tube

07:42.400 --> 07:43.500
and that's that.

07:43.600 --> 07:45.000
And you have
different size pee tubes

07:45.100 --> 07:46.600
if you happen to have
big genitals.

07:46.700 --> 07:48.100
What about the liability?

07:48.200 --> 07:49.500
What happens if you hit a bump

07:49.600 --> 07:51.100
with your dick
and balls in a tube

07:51.200 --> 07:53.000
and you...
It chops it off?

07:53.100 --> 07:55.600
So people sign a little waiver
or something. Big deal.

07:55.700 --> 07:57.400
Nathan, it's a...
What do women do?

07:57.500 --> 07:59.400
What do women do?
Half of our market?

08:00.800 --> 08:02.500
All right. So women
don't have to use it.

08:02.600 --> 08:05.600
You can't turn the interior
of a car into a urinal.

08:05.700 --> 08:08.600
Bad idea.
The car is perfect.

08:08.700 --> 08:11.000
I'm sure I could've worked
something out for women.

08:11.100 --> 08:13.200
Nathan, your job is to sell it,

08:13.300 --> 08:14.500
and if you can't do that job,

08:14.500 --> 08:15.800
we're gonna find
somebody else that can.

08:15.900 --> 08:17.400
You are invested
in this company.

08:17.600 --> 08:19.600
You have ten percent
of this company.

08:21.200 --> 08:22.500
You wanna walk away from that?

08:22.600 --> 08:24.500
Are you offering me
my ten percent back?

08:24.600 --> 08:27.800
I will happily give
you your ten percent back.

08:27.900 --> 08:30.300
You have a deal.

08:30.400 --> 08:31.900
You're making a huge mistake.

08:32.000 --> 08:33.500
I think you're
making a mistake.

08:33.600 --> 08:36.000
It's the worst decision
you've ever made in your life.

08:36.100 --> 08:38.799
You made the worst
Howard.

08:40.600 --> 08:42.200
How beautiful is this?

08:42.299 --> 08:44.600
I don't think that salmon
was wild, by the way.

08:44.700 --> 08:46.800
- Did you see this?
- Oh my God, that's beautiful.

08:46.900 --> 08:51.900
We have a rosewater-infused,
white chocolate souffle,

08:52.000 --> 08:54.400
with an almond chutney.

08:54.500 --> 08:57.700
And here we have the raspberry
and chocolate mousse

08:57.800 --> 09:01.400
with a kola nut
and coco mousse in the center.

09:01.500 --> 09:04.800
- Kola nut?
- Yes, kola nut. Enjoy.

09:04.900 --> 09:08.100
I was... I was walking
down Castro street,

09:08.200 --> 09:11.400
and this fat woman
is coming toward me

09:11.500 --> 09:13.800
and she bumps me
with her stomach

09:13.900 --> 09:15.400
and knocks me off the curb.

09:15.500 --> 09:17.200
It was hilarious.

09:17.300 --> 09:18.800
What is...
What did you do to her?

09:18.900 --> 09:20.300
Are you ok?

09:20.400 --> 09:21.700
Yeah, of course, I'm ok.
It was funny.

09:21.800 --> 09:24.000
There was a cop, saw the whole
thing, he was laughing.

09:24.100 --> 09:26.100
This city, what's happening
is disgusting.

09:26.200 --> 09:28.900
These homeless people, the
hospitals are releasing them...

09:29.000 --> 09:30.600
- It's so sad.
- They're in Mountain view now.

09:30.700 --> 09:33.200
It's not sad.
It's a funny story.

09:33.300 --> 09:36.000
- I just don't understand...
- You don't think that's funny?

09:36.100 --> 09:37.800
A fat woman just hits
me off the road...

09:37.900 --> 09:39.500
If you say fat again...

09:39.600 --> 09:41.200
Oh, you can't say fat.

09:41.300 --> 09:43.000
You can't say fat.

09:43.000 --> 09:45.000
What is going on
with electron motors?

09:45.100 --> 09:46.800
I'm very excited about
the electric car coming out.

09:46.900 --> 09:48.800
Oh, my gosh.
You have no idea.

09:48.900 --> 09:50.700
They doubled that battery life.
Did you know that?

09:50.800 --> 09:53.200
- They have doubled that battery life.
- What?

09:53.300 --> 09:55.200
- You're sitting on a fortune.
- That thing is gonna be huge.

09:55.300 --> 09:59.300
- I'm so excited.
- Yeah, well, there's a problem.

09:59.400 --> 10:01.400
With the car?

10:01.500 --> 10:05.100
- I'm out of the company.
- What?

10:05.300 --> 10:09.600
Yeah. There was a presentation
today and he revealed

10:09.700 --> 10:13.300
that the name
of the car is Howard,

10:13.400 --> 10:15.300
and I had
a big problem with that.

10:15.400 --> 10:16.400
And he said,
"if you don't like it,

10:16.500 --> 10:18.000
"you can sell back
your shares," and I did.

10:18.100 --> 10:19.900
No, you didn't.
Please tell me you're joking.

10:19.900 --> 10:21.000
No. I'm not joking.

10:21.100 --> 10:22.700
Because he named his car
Howard? This is a joke?

10:22.800 --> 10:25.800
You can't name a car Howard.
It's just not a name of a car.

10:25.900 --> 10:29.600
Honey, enough about the name.
Let's get back to the shares.

10:29.700 --> 10:34.500
You have to go back
and get your shares back.

10:36.400 --> 10:38.000
I actually love
the name Howard.

10:38.100 --> 10:40.700
I do. I was thinking
about the name last night.

10:40.800 --> 10:43.500
Howard's a solid name.
Howard's a good guy.

10:43.600 --> 10:46.500
There's a lot of good
Howards. They're average.

10:46.600 --> 10:49.900
They're an average guy
doing average things.

10:50.000 --> 10:51.600
And this is the campaign:

10:51.700 --> 10:54.200
Solid, dependable, trustworthy,

10:54.300 --> 10:55.500
that's our Howard.

10:56.700 --> 10:59.500
The name that yesterday
you had nothing

10:59.600 --> 11:01.100
but disparaging comments about.

11:01.300 --> 11:04.600
I'm really sorry.
I am. I'm sorry.

11:04.700 --> 11:08.000
Yeah. Sounds to me like
you're sorry you fucked up,

11:08.100 --> 11:11.000
but not, you know,

11:11.100 --> 11:12.500
not for what's underneath it.

11:12.600 --> 11:15.300
I apologized.
That's what's important.

11:15.400 --> 11:18.100
It doesn't matter if you
apologize if it's not sincere.

11:18.200 --> 11:20.300
Apologies don't have
to be sincere.

11:20.400 --> 11:22.600
It's just the act
of the apology itself.

11:22.700 --> 11:26.000
It's only... all that matters
is if you're acting sincere.

11:26.100 --> 11:27.800
That is literally
the only thing

11:27.900 --> 11:30.100
an apology has to be,
is sincere.

11:30.200 --> 11:31.600
Oh God, will, I completely...

11:31.700 --> 11:34.300
- Otherwise, it's just words.
- I'm acting sincere.

11:34.400 --> 11:36.000
Of course, I don't believe it.

11:36.100 --> 11:39.800
Here at this company,
we believe in sincerity.

11:39.900 --> 11:42.300
You had the opportunity
to meet my son yesterday,

11:42.400 --> 11:44.600
the one thing in the world
that I happen to care about

11:44.600 --> 11:45.600
more than this company.

11:45.600 --> 11:48.000
What did you do?
Do you remember?

11:48.100 --> 11:49.900
You talked about
his nanny's hair

11:50.000 --> 11:51.800
and how much it might stink.

11:51.900 --> 11:55.100
Nope. Never said
the nanny's hair stunk.

11:55.200 --> 11:57.200
I never said that.
I never said it stunk.

11:57.300 --> 11:58.400
You know what you didn't say?

11:58.400 --> 11:59.800
- What?
- "Cute kid."

11:59.900 --> 12:01.400
- I was gonna get to that.
- "What a nice son."

12:01.500 --> 12:03.300
What a great job
you did raising your son

12:03.400 --> 12:04.900
as a single parent.

12:05.000 --> 12:07.200
"What a nice job,
seems like a good kid."

12:07.300 --> 12:09.000
You know what,
you don't get to that.

12:09.100 --> 12:10.100
You lead with it.

12:10.200 --> 12:11.600
How could you lead with it

12:11.700 --> 12:13.400
if somebody's shampooing
once a week.

12:13.500 --> 12:15.600
Janine has your severance
package at the front desk.

12:15.700 --> 12:17.200
Your things
have been packed up.

12:17.300 --> 12:18.700
You can tell the delivery
company to take them

12:18.800 --> 12:20.000
wherever you need them to be.

12:21.600 --> 12:23.600
I'm sorry
it had to be like this.

12:23.700 --> 12:26.500
Are you sorry?
Are you really sorry?

12:28.000 --> 12:30.200
- No.
- You see?

12:30.300 --> 12:31.800
You did the exact
same thing I did.

12:31.900 --> 12:35.800
You apologized,
but you didn't mean it.

12:35.900 --> 12:37.600
Janine has your things.

12:37.700 --> 12:39.700
The delivery guys
need an address.

12:48.700 --> 12:51.100
You know, I was an early
investor in this company.

12:51.200 --> 12:52.900
I believe in this car.

12:53.000 --> 12:55.200
I thought we were good friends.

12:55.300 --> 12:56.600
Will, this isn't fair.

12:56.700 --> 12:59.300
It's not fair.

Oh, come on.

Thank you, rolly.

15:45.800 --> 15:49.400
And I got you a little pickle.

15:49.500 --> 15:51.200
Hmm, a pickle.

15:51.300 --> 15:53.200
Half sweet, half sour.

15:53.300 --> 15:54.200
Just like you.

15:54.300 --> 15:56.300
I don't eat pickles.

15:56.400 --> 15:58.200
You've been working
for me nine years.

15:58.300 --> 15:59.800
You should know that, rolly.

16:00.000 --> 16:02.600
You drive me crazy.
I just wanna eat in peace.

16:02.700 --> 16:03.900
What do you think
you're doing to me?

16:04.000 --> 16:05.700
Here. You don't want the pickle?

16:05.800 --> 16:07.500
- I'll take the pickle. Ok?
- Please.

16:07.600 --> 16:09.100
Yeah, get it out of my sight.

16:09.200 --> 16:10.500
And don't eat it
in front of me.

16:10.600 --> 16:12.400
- Oh, my God.
- It makes me sick.

16:12.500 --> 16:14.400
I'm gonna tell you something,
it's fantastic.

16:14.500 --> 16:16.100

That was quite awful.

16:49.000 --> 16:50.400
It's your birthday.

16:50.500 --> 16:52.300
I'm really looking forward
to getting wasted

16:52.400 --> 16:53.600
with somebody who's turning 90.

16:53.600 --> 16:54.600
That's gonna be a first for me.

16:54.700 --> 16:55.900
Wow, that's
really sweet of you.

16:59.600 --> 17:01.600
- Yeah.
- Let's go. Come on.

17:01.700 --> 17:03.500
- Nathan flomm, marketing.
- What?

17:03.600 --> 17:06.800
- Who's that?
- Oh, yeah, a guy.

17:06.900 --> 17:09.400
The old owner must have left it
in the closet or something.

17:09.500 --> 17:11.900
I don't know. What's the plan?
North oak tavern?

17:12.000 --> 17:14.400
That's the plan.
Beer's on me.

17:15.700 --> 17:16.700
What do you think?

17:17.800 --> 17:19.500
- A Howard?
- Yup.

17:19.599 --> 17:21.300
Half the people on
the island drive this.

17:21.400 --> 17:23.200
Why should I be the only
asshole paying for gas.

17:24.300 --> 17:26.200
Let's take my car.

17:26.300 --> 17:27.599
Why would we take your car?
I got a brand-new car.

17:27.700 --> 17:29.600
I wanna drive you
in it tonight. Come on.

17:29.700 --> 17:31.600
I'd really rather
we take my car.

17:31.700 --> 17:33.200
Come on. Get in. We're going.
I'm gonna show it to you.

17:33.300 --> 17:34.600
Do you see
how the doors open up?

17:34.600 --> 17:36.700
I know how they open up,
it was my idea.

17:36.800 --> 17:38.100
What do you mean
it was your idea?

17:38.100 --> 17:39.300
Well, I mean, you know,

17:39.400 --> 17:41.900
I had that idea
a long time ago.

17:42.000 --> 17:44.400
Well, then you should
sue the company.

17:44.500 --> 17:47.400
- Watch this.
<i>- Hi, Frank.</i>

17:57.700 --> 18:01.300
I'm ready, ready for
a nice big meal on you.

18:01.400 --> 18:03.100
- Oh, on me?
- Absolutely.

18:03.200 --> 18:05.800
I said one drink, I didn't say
drinking for the whole night.

18:05.900 --> 18:08.200
What? Are you kidding?
It's my birthday.

18:08.300 --> 18:09.800
You have to pay
for my... come on.

18:09.900 --> 18:12.000
Surprise!

18:12.100 --> 18:15.600
Fuck! My fucking nose!

18:15.700 --> 18:17.700
- I'm so sorry.
- Oh, rolly...

18:17.800 --> 18:19.300
Who is this guy?

18:19.400 --> 18:21.500
- Look, you know...
- Uh-huh. You got me.

18:21.600 --> 18:23.000
I'm really sorry.

18:23.100 --> 18:24.700
Honestly, I just got
frightened, I guess.

18:24.700 --> 18:28.000
I saw a face and I lashed out.

18:28.100 --> 18:29.800
You're frightened
of a black man. Just say...

18:29.800 --> 18:31.200
- [Speaking gibberish]
- I don't think so.

18:31.300 --> 18:33.000
I don't think I was frightened
of the black man. No.

18:33.100 --> 18:34.600
It could've been any black
person standing there.

18:34.700 --> 18:36.200
It could've been
a black old lady

18:36.300 --> 18:37.600
saying, "hey, surprise."

18:37.700 --> 18:38.800
Are you gonna punch her
in the fucking nose?

18:38.900 --> 18:40.200
- I don't...
- A little kid?

18:40.300 --> 18:42.400
A dwarf, a black dwarf? Have
you ever seen a black dwarf?

18:42.500 --> 18:45.300
Yeah. I would've punched a white
dwarf, too, and a white old lady.

18:45.500 --> 18:46.600
You wouldn't have punched
a white dwarf.

18:46.700 --> 18:48.200
No one punches white dwarfs.
They play around.

18:48.300 --> 18:50.600
They pick them up. You never
punch a white dwarf in the face.

18:50.700 --> 18:51.800
What, I have dwarf racism?

18:51.900 --> 18:53.700
Of course, there's
always dwarf racism.

18:53.800 --> 18:55.500
So you mean the white dwarf
is cuddly and cute...

18:55.600 --> 18:58.000
White people are afraid
of black dwarfs.

18:58.100 --> 19:00.500
I would find a black dwarf
just as cuddly as a white dwarf.

19:00.600 --> 19:01.800
You're way off base there.

19:01.900 --> 19:03.700
You'd pick them up and
punch them in the fuckin' face.

19:03.800 --> 19:05.400
I'm really sorry,

19:05.500 --> 19:07.600
and I beg your forgiveness.

19:07.700 --> 19:09.300
We're good?

19:10.200 --> 19:11.800
Very nice.

19:11.900 --> 19:13.200
Honestly, you guys are great.

19:13.300 --> 19:16.200
- Happy Birthday, rolly!
- To my boy rolly.

19:16.300 --> 19:18.100
Ok. All right. Ok.

19:18.200 --> 19:20.600
- Pretty good party.
- Rolly deserves it.

19:20.700 --> 19:23.000
You know a lot of people
come into my diner,

19:23.000 --> 19:24.500
I gotta tell you,
that rolly davore

19:24.600 --> 19:27.200
is the nicest guy I know.

19:28.300 --> 19:30.100
Yeah.

19:30.200 --> 19:31.400
Happy Birthday.

19:31.500 --> 19:33.400
- Thank you.
- Here, it's for you.

19:33.600 --> 19:35.400
Oh. Wendy.

19:35.500 --> 19:37.500
You know, that's one of
the benefits of breaking up,

19:37.600 --> 19:39.400
I didn't have to spend
as much this year.

19:39.500 --> 19:41.800
Looks like
you didn't spend anything.

19:41.900 --> 19:45.400
I didn't. Yeah, I just was
cleaning out my drawer at home.

19:47.500 --> 19:49.500
How's the job hunt, anything?

19:49.600 --> 19:52.400
Still looking.
There's nothing.

19:52.500 --> 19:53.900
I gotta get out of that diner.

19:54.000 --> 19:56.700
I smell like fried clams.
I can't take it.

19:56.800 --> 19:59.400
- Well, I'll keep my ears open.
- Thanks, thanks.

19:59.500 --> 20:01.300
Cake, there's gonna
be cake, right?

20:01.400 --> 20:04.400
- I guess.
- Ok. Dancing?

20:04.500 --> 20:06.700
- No.
- Yeah, come on.

20:06.800 --> 20:08.800
Pussy.

20:09.000 --> 20:10.200
You can't sleep
in the same bed with a woman?

20:10.300 --> 20:12.600
No. I mean,
I enjoy the sex part,

20:12.700 --> 20:15.400
but the sleeping part,
I'm not good at.

20:15.500 --> 20:17.300
I need the space in the bed,

20:17.400 --> 20:19.900
and I feel like
the air is contaminated

20:20.000 --> 20:21.100
from the breathing.

20:21.200 --> 20:23.000
They're shedding skin cells.

20:23.100 --> 20:24.500
Skin cells? What are you,
a fucking microscope?

20:24.600 --> 20:26.100
I just wanna close
my eyes and go to bed.

20:26.200 --> 20:27.400
What else is there to do?

20:27.500 --> 20:30.000
Happy Birthday, rolly.

20:34.700 --> 20:35.900
It's Jennifer.

20:36.000 --> 20:37.600
Are you kidding me?

20:37.700 --> 20:39.900
No, I'm not kidding you.
I lost a lot of weight.

20:40.000 --> 20:41.900
I just can't get over
what I'm seeing.

20:42.000 --> 20:44.600
It's me, it's just
a lot less of me.

20:44.700 --> 20:46.000
That is incredible.

20:46.100 --> 20:49.100
It is incredible.
It changed my life, rolly.

20:49.200 --> 20:50.500
Everything good.
I got a new job.

20:50.600 --> 20:52.900
I got... I'm engaged
to be married.

20:54.300 --> 20:55.600
Really?

20:55.700 --> 20:56.900
I'm engaged to be
married, yeah.

20:57.000 --> 20:58.600
I'm surprised.

20:58.700 --> 20:59.900
Why?

21:00.000 --> 21:02.300
You know, you could have
a lot of suitors now.

21:02.400 --> 21:05.800
Go off and get engaged
to the first guy you meet?

21:05.900 --> 21:08.400
You're in demand.

21:08.500 --> 21:10.100
Did he like you
when you were fat?

21:10.200 --> 21:12.200
He never talked to me
when I was fat.

21:12.300 --> 21:15.100
Ok, there you go. See, he's
superficial, just like me.

21:15.200 --> 21:17.200
I wouldn't have dated you
when you were fat either.

21:17.300 --> 21:19.700
- I'm sorry to say.
- What a terrible thing to say.

21:19.900 --> 21:22.200
Yeah, I know, it's terrible
but it's true, it's true.

21:22.300 --> 21:23.200
Huh...

21:23.300 --> 21:24.400
Who is he?

21:24.500 --> 21:26.100
His name is jaspar.

21:26.200 --> 21:28.200
He's the guy you...
In the face when you walked in.

21:28.300 --> 21:30.200
He's the guy over there.

21:49.100 --> 21:52.800
- Hey. Rolly, how are you?
- Hey. Hi, Carl.

21:52.900 --> 21:54.700
Did you get that birthday
e-mail I sent you?

21:54.800 --> 21:57.700
Oh, well, you know Carl,
generally, I gotta tell you,

21:57.800 --> 22:01.000
I don't reply
to birthday e-mails.

22:01.100 --> 22:02.700
You know, "thank you very much."

22:02.800 --> 22:05.700
So kind of you.
Oh, you remembered."

22:05.800 --> 22:07.800
It turns the birthday
into a job.

22:07.900 --> 22:08.800
Yeah.

22:08.900 --> 22:10.100
The birthday
shouldn't be a job.

22:10.200 --> 22:11.700
We should be celebrating
a birthday.

22:11.800 --> 22:13.200
We shouldn't be going,
"oh, it's my birthday,

22:13.300 --> 22:16.100
- "I have to go to work."
- Yeah, you're right.

22:18.500 --> 22:21.000
- Hey, rolly.
- Hey.

22:21.100 --> 22:23.000
- Hey, rolly.
- Oh, hey, Wendy.

22:23.100 --> 22:24.900
- Great party.
- Thank you for the shoelaces.

22:24.900 --> 22:25.800
Oh, you're very welcome.

22:25.900 --> 22:27.900
She got me shoelaces
for my birthday.

22:28.000 --> 22:30.700
Big fucking cocksucker.
Let me ask you somethin'!

22:30.800 --> 22:34.600
What the fuck is that thing
you're building over there?

22:34.700 --> 22:37.900
You wanna have a cup
of coffee, sober up?

22:38.000 --> 22:39.500
That was my daddy's place, Mac.

22:39.600 --> 22:41.300
Yeah, well, it's not his now.

22:41.400 --> 22:42.600
"Well, it's not his now."

22:42.700 --> 22:44.500
Not his now
'cause of guys like you.

22:44.600 --> 22:46.100
You're fucking up
the whole island.

22:46.200 --> 22:48.200
I was just hired to build
a house, that's all.

22:48.300 --> 22:50.600
- Mcmansion, Mr. mcmansion.
- Come on, we gotta go, brother.

22:50.700 --> 22:52.000
Blue heron's fucked!

22:52.100 --> 22:55.700
The whole fucking
island's... fucked!

22:55.800 --> 22:58.600
Please, honey...
I'm begging you.

22:58.700 --> 23:00.500
You're
a mcfucking prick!

23:00.600 --> 23:02.700
Stumpo, come on.

23:09.800 --> 23:15.200
Well, there's
my favorite birthday boy.

23:15.300 --> 23:18.500
I had such a great time
at your party last night.

23:18.600 --> 23:20.000
It was a hell of a party.

23:20.100 --> 23:22.400
Well, you deserve it.
You're the best guy.

23:22.500 --> 23:24.600
Thank you, Gladys.
That's sweet.

23:24.700 --> 23:26.000
All right. Let me know
if you need anything.

23:26.100 --> 23:29.800
There's one little thing
that's kind of been on my mind

23:29.900 --> 23:31.000
and I've been meaning
to tell you about it.

23:31.100 --> 23:32.200
What?

23:32.300 --> 23:35.900
I noticed that you put
the silverware on the table.

23:36.000 --> 23:37.800
That's where you put
silverware.

23:37.900 --> 23:41.700
It doesn't seem quite
sanitary to me.

23:41.800 --> 23:43.800
It's clean. I cleaned it
right before you came in.

23:43.900 --> 23:45.200
The last people left, I...

23:45.300 --> 23:47.400
And how did you wash
the table, Gladys?

23:47.500 --> 23:48.900
I have these cloths
that are like...

23:48.900 --> 23:51.300
These rags?

23:52.700 --> 23:54.000
- See what I mean?
- My rags aren't dirty.

23:54.100 --> 23:57.700
Oh, Gladys, rags
by their very nature are dirty.

23:57.800 --> 24:00.500
The rag is a filthy animal.

24:00.600 --> 24:02.600
So what are you saying?

24:02.700 --> 24:06.200
Why not put
the silverware on a napkin?

24:06.300 --> 24:10.200
Terrific idea.
I'll get back to you, ok?

24:16.200 --> 24:17.400
What the fuck, man?

24:17.500 --> 24:19.900
You're telling Jennifer
she should date other people?

24:20.000 --> 24:21.600
You don't want her dating a black
man, that's what it is, right?

24:21.700 --> 24:23.400
No, no, no. Of course not.

24:23.500 --> 24:26.800
And I said that to her before I
knew who she was going out with.

24:26.900 --> 24:28.200
You're fucking me all up.

24:28.300 --> 24:29.500
First you punched me and shit.

24:29.600 --> 24:31.300
Now, you're telling
fucking Jennifer

24:31.400 --> 24:32.900
that she should
date other people.

24:33.000 --> 24:34.400
Who the fuck does that shit,

24:34.500 --> 24:36.200
but a jealous, racist
motherfucker?

24:36.300 --> 24:37.600
Oh, no, no, no.

24:37.700 --> 24:39.000
You don't want her dating
a black man, that's what it is.

24:39.100 --> 24:41.400
- No. That's ridiculous.
- It's gotta be.

24:41.500 --> 24:42.900
I don't care who she dates.

24:43.000 --> 24:44.800
You know how hard it is
to find a Cuban woman?

24:44.900 --> 24:46.100
That shit ain't easy, man.

24:46.200 --> 24:48.600
Three or four of them escape
Cuba every fucking day.

24:48.700 --> 24:50.100
That's a low ratio.

24:50.200 --> 24:52.000
They come over here on fucking
rafts and holding on wood

24:52.100 --> 24:53.400
and floating their
ass over here.

24:53.500 --> 24:56.200
Sometimes they float on other
fucking Cubans, sometimes.

24:56.300 --> 24:57.400
They gotta use
a Cuban to float on.

24:57.500 --> 25:00.900
Leave her the fuck alone,
man. Stay out of my shit.

25:01.000 --> 25:02.000
Sorry.

25:03.900 --> 25:05.800
Something about you.

25:05.900 --> 25:07.500
I haven't put my finger
on that shit yet,

25:07.600 --> 25:08.500
but there's something
about you, man.

25:08.600 --> 25:10.300
You're fucking familiar to me.

25:10.400 --> 25:11.800
You haven't seen me anywhere.

25:11.900 --> 25:13.300
Maybe on TV.

25:13.400 --> 25:16.300
I'll figure this shit out.
It will come to me.

25:16.400 --> 25:18.300
Get the fuck out of here
with that wagoneer.

25:18.400 --> 25:20.200
That's a white man's
fucking car.

25:20.300 --> 25:21.500
Who the fuck rides
around with wood

25:21.600 --> 25:23.000
on the side
of their fucking car?

25:23.100 --> 25:24.900
Nobody does that shit.

25:29.100 --> 25:32.500
Too much to the right.
Go to the left, rolly.

25:32.600 --> 25:36.100
Come on, dig in.
That's a boy.

25:36.200 --> 25:38.700
I... you know...
Who are you, captain bligh?

25:38.800 --> 25:40.800
You can stop shouting
out instructions to me.

25:40.900 --> 25:43.500
I know what I'm doing.

25:51.000 --> 25:52.600
Ooh, look at that.

25:56.700 --> 25:59.500
Those must be the people
who bought Blue heron.

26:02.900 --> 26:04.600
That's a shame.

26:04.800 --> 26:09.100
That used to be a beautiful
piece of property

26:09.200 --> 26:11.400
with a beautiful home on it.

26:11.500 --> 26:13.200
It doesn't have the charm
that it used to

26:13.300 --> 26:14.900
when the stumpos owned it.

26:15.000 --> 26:17.400
I don't know
what they were thinking of.

26:17.500 --> 26:19.700
Must have enough money...

26:40.500 --> 26:42.600
All right, looking good.

26:43.700 --> 26:46.100
All this stuff is
going to the kids' gym.

26:46.200 --> 26:49.100
We'll get it all unpacked
and everything...

26:58.700 --> 27:00.500
Oh, hey, uh, great...

27:00.600 --> 27:02.600
I wanted to tell him,
but I didn't have a chance.

27:02.700 --> 27:04.000
A lot of these boxes in here,

27:04.100 --> 27:06.100
the flat stuff, are mirrors,

27:06.200 --> 27:08.200
so just be extra careful
with those.

27:08.300 --> 27:09.800
Obviously,
no one wants bad luck.

27:11.100 --> 27:12.900
I'm in your way.

27:13.000 --> 27:14.900
I'm so sorry.
You have a job to do.

27:15.000 --> 27:17.000
Uh, I will let you
get on with it.

27:17.100 --> 27:18.800
Thank you.

27:46.500 --> 27:48.400
Back up, back up.

27:48.500 --> 27:49.700
Just back up.

27:49.800 --> 27:51.400
- Me?
- Yeah, back...

27:51.500 --> 27:52.800
Right over here, there's
a place. Right over there.

27:52.900 --> 27:54.500
- Are you kidding?
- No, come on.

27:54.600 --> 27:57.100
You have a clearance
right around the bend there.

27:57.200 --> 27:59.400
- I can't back...
- Of course, you can.

27:59.500 --> 28:01.700
I'm way back there,
you should be backing up.

28:01.800 --> 28:04.800
- Back up.
- Damn it.

28:04.900 --> 28:07.200
- You're supposed to back up.
- Fuck you. Let's just go.

28:07.300 --> 28:09.000
Asshole.

28:12.300 --> 28:15.500
My clearance is
like 80 yards behind me.

28:15.600 --> 28:18.700
He's got... just right around
a little bend, it's nothing.

28:18.800 --> 28:21.300
- Right.
- And he won't back up.

28:21.400 --> 28:23.400
I'll tell you this,
if that's happen to me again,

28:23.400 --> 28:25.200
no way I'm backing up.
I don't give a shit who it is.

28:25.300 --> 28:27.400
- Stand your ground.
- But it happens all the time.

28:27.500 --> 28:29.400
Last time that happened to me,

28:29.500 --> 28:31.700
I just pulled up, I wouldn't
move, he wouldn't move.

28:31.800 --> 28:33.300
I get out of the car
and I started walking away.

28:33.400 --> 28:34.900
The guy goes, "where are you
going?" I said, "I'm leaving.

28:35.000 --> 28:36.600
You happy now, asshole?
You win."

28:36.700 --> 28:38.500
And I walked
and I left the truck

28:38.600 --> 28:40.200
and I went
to bridget tobert's house

28:40.300 --> 28:42.200
and I just smoked a joint
and came out an hour later.

28:42.300 --> 28:44.400
Truck's there,
he's gone, I win!

28:44.500 --> 28:46.500
You guys ready to play
cards or what?

28:46.600 --> 28:48.000
Yeah. What are we playing?

28:48.100 --> 28:51.400
Chicago, highest spade
in the hole, splits the pot.

28:51.500 --> 28:53.500
Speaking of Chicago,
anyone going to the concert?

28:53.600 --> 28:55.900
- What concert?
- The Chicago concert.

28:56.000 --> 28:57.200
They're coming back
to the island.

28:57.300 --> 28:58.400
They haven't been here
for 20 years.

28:58.500 --> 29:00.600
Wendy should be happy
about that.

29:00.700 --> 29:03.300
What does that mean?

29:03.300 --> 29:04.500
Why should Wendy
be happy about it?

29:04.600 --> 29:06.600
Last time they were here,
she blew the lot of them.

29:06.700 --> 29:09.000
Is that supposed to be a joke?

29:09.100 --> 29:11.300
No! They came here
20 years ago,

29:11.400 --> 29:12.500
she went to the concert

29:12.600 --> 29:14.700
and she ended up
blowing the band.

29:14.800 --> 29:16.300
- Allegedly.
- It's a rumor.

29:16.400 --> 29:18.300
- Wendy blew Chicago.
- Wendy the waitress,

29:18.400 --> 29:20.000
who I lived with
for three years, that's...?

29:20.100 --> 29:22.500
- No, not the whole band.
- How many did she blow?

29:22.600 --> 29:25.000
- What's the difference?
- There's a big difference.

29:25.100 --> 29:27.900
If you blow one guy,
ok, I get it,

29:28.000 --> 29:29.600
people blow people, it happens.

29:29.700 --> 29:32.600
But what? We're not talking
about Simon & Garfunkel here.

29:32.700 --> 29:35.100
This is Chicago.
That's a big band.

29:36.200 --> 29:38.300
Was it one? How many was it?

29:38.400 --> 29:40.400
I know she blew Robert lamm
and James pankow.

29:40.500 --> 29:41.700
- No way.
- Yeah.

29:41.800 --> 29:43.700
Lee loughnane was
in on that, I will bet on it.

29:43.800 --> 29:45.600
I don't wanna get you upset,
but as a friend,

29:45.600 --> 29:46.700
I heard it was three.

29:46.800 --> 29:48.500
But you don't wanna
get me upset?

29:48.600 --> 29:49.900
- No, no.
- No.

29:50.000 --> 29:52.000
You don't wanna get me upset,
but you heard it was three.

29:52.100 --> 29:53.400
You're my friend,
I don't wanna get you upset.

29:53.500 --> 29:54.600
Oh, no, I really
appreciate that!

29:54.700 --> 29:57.200
"Your ex-girlfriend blew
three guys from Chicago."

29:57.300 --> 29:58.500
You're not gonna get me upset.

29:58.600 --> 30:00.400
You're all wrong.
It was four.

30:00.500 --> 30:02.100
Fuck you, dottie.

30:02.200 --> 30:05.300
Ok? If anybody was blowing
Chicago that night, it was you.

30:05.400 --> 30:07.900
I wish.

30:08.000 --> 30:09.400
I'm gonna find out
about this, by the way.

30:09.500 --> 30:11.200
I'll get you a picture
from when she was in high school

30:11.300 --> 30:13.300
and you show it to the band
and see who remembers her.

30:13.400 --> 30:14.700
- Ok. Yeah.
- They'll remember.

30:14.800 --> 30:18.000
One thing I don't understand,
why do you care?

30:18.100 --> 30:20.700
Everybody seems to know about it
except me and it pisses me off.

30:20.800 --> 30:22.800
If I were you,
this whole Chicago thing,

30:22.900 --> 30:24.700
I'd let it go.

30:26.000 --> 30:28.100
Eh... we'll see.

30:28.200 --> 30:30.500
Who's this?

30:30.600 --> 30:33.200
- I'll find out.
- Rolly, two to you.

30:33.300 --> 30:36.200
Hey, everybody, this is my friend will.
I met him at the barge.

30:36.300 --> 30:39.100
I wanted to show him
some island hospitality.

30:39.200 --> 30:41.300
- Will, this is dottie.
- Hi, will, how are you?

30:41.400 --> 30:43.200
Mike, Rick, rolly,
and that's Frank

30:43.300 --> 30:45.900
- and that's molgy.
- For all your insurance needs?

30:46.000 --> 30:47.300
Thank you very much.

30:47.400 --> 30:48.800
Hey, I don't wanna
kiss your ass,

30:48.900 --> 30:50.800
but I'm the proud
new owner of a Howard.

30:50.900 --> 30:53.700
Thank you. It's been very
successful, been very good.

30:53.800 --> 30:55.100
Who do I give money to?

30:55.200 --> 30:57.200
- Oh, you brought your money, good.
- I did indeed.

30:57.300 --> 31:00.200
We love new card players.
You're in.

31:00.300 --> 31:01.800
Do we know one another?

31:01.900 --> 31:03.700
I feel like...
I feel like we've met.

31:03.800 --> 31:07.600
You thought I was a mover
a couple days ago.

31:07.700 --> 31:08.800
You thought he was a mover?

31:08.900 --> 31:11.900
Him? He's like
90 years old.

31:12.000 --> 31:14.800
No, I did not.

31:14.900 --> 31:17.300
Starving seniors? It must've
been the shoulders.

31:17.400 --> 31:20.600
I feel terrible.
I hope I tipped you.

31:22.400 --> 31:24.100
Hey, will,
is it true you have

31:24.200 --> 31:26.000
an actual
bowling alley in there?

31:26.100 --> 31:27.800
- We do.
- And a tennis court?

31:27.900 --> 31:29.300
We don't have the tennis court.

31:29.400 --> 31:30.700
Oh, just thought
I'd bring that up.

31:30.800 --> 31:32.800
The basketball court
can be multipurpose,

31:32.900 --> 31:34.500
so we can, uh,
we can work it out.

31:34.600 --> 31:35.900
You guys ready to play
cards here or...?

31:36.000 --> 31:37.900
Was there a guy,
like a few years ago,

31:38.000 --> 31:40.300
is this true or is this myth,
about the guy who was like

31:40.400 --> 31:42.600
your partner or something
when you started the company,

31:42.600 --> 31:44.300
but he got out early
and then...

31:44.500 --> 31:46.500
He would've ended up making
like a million dollars?

31:46.600 --> 31:48.200
Yes. He was one
of our marketing guys

31:48.300 --> 31:50.400
back when we were
just a little start-up,

31:50.500 --> 31:52.900
and we were just about ready
to take the car public.

31:53.000 --> 31:55.400
Had he kept that investment
stake in the company,

31:55.500 --> 31:57.800
it would've been worth somewhere
in the area of a billion dollars?

31:57.900 --> 32:01.100
- Oh!
- That's just his?

32:01.200 --> 32:02.900
- Yeah.
- What an idiot!

32:04.700 --> 32:06.600
He must regret
every day of his life.

32:06.700 --> 32:08.400
Maybe he's happy.

32:08.500 --> 32:11.200
- That's what I like to think.
- He's a broke idiot!

32:11.300 --> 32:12.900
Maybe he has his integrity.

32:13.000 --> 32:15.300
- I'd rather have 12 bathrooms.
- That's right.

32:15.400 --> 32:16.500
You don't know
what he was thinking.

32:16.600 --> 32:18.400
Maybe he wanted to get
away from the company.

32:18.400 --> 32:19.600
Maybe he was an idiot.

32:19.700 --> 32:21.200
Maybe he doesn't give
a fuck about money!

32:21.300 --> 32:22.600
What do you know
about this guy?!

32:22.600 --> 32:24.400
- I don't know shit about him!
- I know you don't.

32:24.500 --> 32:26.000
Because he's a moron!

32:26.100 --> 32:29.900
I wouldn't be associated
with somebody that stupid.

32:30.000 --> 32:32.500
Come on. Who's in?

32:32.600 --> 32:34.600
Here, you know what?
I'm gonna take off.

32:34.700 --> 32:37.100
- Aw, come on, rolly.
- Come on, rolly.

32:37.200 --> 32:38.600
Uh... we'll do it next week.

32:38.700 --> 32:40.500
- All right, rolly.
- Nice to meet you.

32:40.600 --> 32:42.200
- Ok, see you.
- See you next week, rolly.

32:42.300 --> 32:43.700
What's eating him?

32:43.800 --> 32:44.700
Everything ok?

32:44.800 --> 32:48.100
His ex-girlfriend blew Chicago.

32:50.100 --> 32:51.500
Yo, rolly.

32:51.600 --> 32:53.500
What's going on?

32:53.600 --> 32:55.700
Come take a walk.

32:58.600 --> 33:01.500
Jesus, I just can't
even imagine this.

33:01.600 --> 33:04.400
You never told anyone
about any of this?

33:04.500 --> 33:06.600
No, I never told anyone
except your father.

33:06.700 --> 33:08.700
He's the only one who knew.

33:10.300 --> 33:11.600
Yeah.

33:11.700 --> 33:14.100
I don't understand how
haney couldn't recognize you.

33:14.200 --> 33:15.400
I mean, I would
recognize you if that...

33:15.500 --> 33:17.100
No, I look
completely different.

33:17.200 --> 33:19.500
How different could you look?
I mean, really.

33:19.600 --> 33:21.200
All right.
How about that?

33:21.300 --> 33:22.800
Holy shit.

33:22.900 --> 33:25.400
You look like the guy who
kidnapped Elizabeth smart.

33:25.500 --> 33:26.600
Yeah. That's me.

33:26.700 --> 33:32.000
So, um...
I'm leaving the island.

33:32.100 --> 33:34.800
Yeah. I can't stay
with this guy here.

33:34.900 --> 33:37.000
Oh, come on,
your whole life is here.

33:37.100 --> 33:39.000
Forget it. The guy's
at my poker game now?

33:39.100 --> 33:41.500
I got to hear about his
garish monstrosity of a house

33:41.600 --> 33:44.600
with bowling allies,
a gymnasium. Come on.

33:44.700 --> 33:46.800
And I can't stay here
with him, on the island.

33:46.900 --> 33:50.000
I just can't. I can't be here.
I can't be here. I'm leaving.

33:50.100 --> 33:53.300
I wish there was something
I could do that, you know...

33:53.400 --> 33:55.200
There's nothing anybody can do.

33:55.300 --> 33:57.600
- I'll... yeah.
- We'll be able to hang out...?

34:02.000 --> 34:03.800
<i>Hi, it's Wendy.</i>
<i>Leave me a message.</i>

34:03.900 --> 34:06.800
Hey, Wendy, it's me again.

34:06.900 --> 34:10.199
So, you know, I spoke
to tibby and I told her

34:10.300 --> 34:11.699
you'd make a fine replacement,

34:11.800 --> 34:14.300
and she wants you
to call her tomorrow.

34:14.400 --> 34:17.800
So, you don't have to smell
like clams anymore.

34:17.900 --> 34:20.800
All right, see you.

34:27.699 --> 34:29.000
<i>That's it for us.</i>

34:29.100 --> 34:31.100
<i>Have a great night</i>
<i>and stay tuned</i>

34:31.199 --> 34:33.300
<i>for the midnight matinee.</i>

34:56.400 --> 34:57.700
<i>I couldn't help it,</i>
<i>Howard.</i>

34:57.800 --> 34:59.400
They started making changes
without any reason.

34:59.500 --> 35:01.300
Everybody had authority
and nobody.

35:01.500 --> 35:04.100
I tried to fight, they pushed
me from office to office.

35:04.200 --> 35:07.100
<i>Howard, what are</i>
<i>you going to do?</i>

35:07.200 --> 35:10.600
<i>You have to leave</i>
<i>that up to me now.</i>

35:42.000 --> 35:43.700
Hey.

35:43.800 --> 35:46.000
- Yo, what's happening?
- I gotta talk to you.

35:46.100 --> 35:49.700
All right.
Step into my office.

35:51.200 --> 35:52.400
You're nuts.

35:52.500 --> 35:54.300
This is fucking madness.

35:54.400 --> 35:56.800
You can't blow up
someone's home.

35:56.900 --> 35:58.200
It's not allowed on the island.

35:58.300 --> 35:59.400
It's not allowed
fucking anywhere.

35:59.500 --> 36:00.900
You wouldn't hold up
well in prison.

36:01.000 --> 36:03.000
You think leaving the island
is gonna be any better for me?

36:03.100 --> 36:04.600
Is that supposed
to be a good life for me?

36:04.800 --> 36:06.600
I don't know anybody anywhere.

36:06.700 --> 36:08.300
All my friends are here,
my whole life is here.

36:08.400 --> 36:09.400
My house is here.

36:09.500 --> 36:10.800
He's already
ruined my life once,

36:10.800 --> 36:12.500
is he's gonna ruin it again?

36:12.600 --> 36:13.900
So you're just gonna
gonna end up in jail,

36:14.000 --> 36:15.600
and get turned out
by some fucking Aryan dude

36:15.700 --> 36:16.800
and become his boyfriend.

36:16.900 --> 36:18.200
That's a better outcome to you?

36:18.300 --> 36:20.700
Nobody's gonna rape me.
I'm an old, ugly man.

36:20.800 --> 36:22.900
There might be
someone who would rape you.

36:22.900 --> 36:24.300
I think they can do
better than that.

36:24.400 --> 36:25.500
Well, there's probably
a dude in there

36:25.600 --> 36:27.400
who has a fetish
for an old bald guy.

36:27.500 --> 36:29.400
- A bald fetish...
- It could fucking happen.

36:29.500 --> 36:31.000
I haven't seen
any women with one!

36:31.100 --> 36:34.000
Where would you even
have gotten an idea like this?

36:34.100 --> 36:36.500
<i>The fountainhead.</i>
<i>Howard roark,</i>

36:36.600 --> 36:39.400
he blows up this building
at the end of the movie.

36:41.700 --> 36:43.600
Well, it is a pretty ugly house.

36:43.700 --> 36:45.900
Nobody on the island likes it.

36:46.000 --> 36:48.600
You'd probably be
considered a fucking hero.

36:48.700 --> 36:50.100
Listen, nobody would get hurt,

36:50.200 --> 36:52.300
nobody's gonna be
in the house when this blows up.

36:55.000 --> 36:59.100
I'm just wondering,
how do I do it?

36:59.200 --> 37:00.400
The only guy that I know

37:00.500 --> 37:02.600
that could handle
something like this,

37:02.700 --> 37:04.100
would be Joe stumpo.

37:05.900 --> 37:07.100
Joe stumpo.

37:18.600 --> 37:20.500
Get the fuck out of here!

37:20.600 --> 37:22.900
Hey, stumpo, it's me, Frank.

37:23.000 --> 37:24.900
I don't give a shit,
get out of here.

37:25.000 --> 37:27.600
Hey, Joe, can I talk
to you for a minute?

37:27.700 --> 37:30.100
What do you want?

37:30.200 --> 37:31.700
I know that your family

37:32.800 --> 37:35.000
owned Blue heron
for a long time.

37:35.600 --> 37:37.400
Three generations.

37:37.500 --> 37:41.800
And I've seen what this
multi-billionaire has done

37:41.900 --> 37:44.500
to your old property
and to the island.

37:44.600 --> 37:47.200
He's destroying the island.

37:47.800 --> 37:49.500
I wanna blow it up.

37:49.600 --> 37:51.800
Why do you wanna blow it up?

37:51.900 --> 37:54.500
I want him off the island.

37:56.100 --> 37:59.300
- Is he fucking with me?
- He is not fucking with you.

37:59.400 --> 38:01.100
You think you wanna blow it up?

38:01.200 --> 38:03.200
I've thought about it
every fucking day

38:03.300 --> 38:04.700
for 18 months.

38:04.800 --> 38:07.200
Every time I drive
by the place I think about it.

38:07.300 --> 38:09.100
I see it, I smell it at night.

38:09.200 --> 38:11.300
I can smell the gunpowder.
You can't do it.

38:11.400 --> 38:14.100
Access my friend, you need
access and I don't have it.

38:14.200 --> 38:15.800
What do you mean access?

38:15.900 --> 38:18.300
Access, you gotta get in
or have an inside man.

38:18.400 --> 38:20.500
If I had a guy inside,
if I knew one of the workers,

38:20.600 --> 38:22.700
but those pricks
don't even talk to me.

38:22.800 --> 38:25.300
Inside guy, working
there, that could work.

38:25.400 --> 38:28.800
Otherwise, get it out
of your head. Let it go.

38:28.900 --> 38:31.000
Let it go,
get the fuck out of here.

38:31.900 --> 38:34.800
Hey...
I know McKenzie.

38:34.900 --> 38:37.200
Yeah, that's right.

38:37.300 --> 38:39.700
You're gonna like this, stumpo.

38:41.400 --> 38:44.700
He owes me a big favor.

38:44.700 --> 38:46.500
- Really?
- I can go talk to him.

38:46.600 --> 38:48.700
Maybe I can get a job there.

38:49.800 --> 38:51.300
Rags!

38:52.800 --> 38:55.900
Rags! Cocksucker,
come out here!

38:58.100 --> 38:59.500
Who's this guy?

39:12.300 --> 39:14.000
- It's a deal.
- There you go.

39:14.100 --> 39:15.200
Nice job, Frankie.

39:15.300 --> 39:16.500
Actually, I'm not involved
in this deal.

39:16.600 --> 39:18.100
I was just here
to introduce you guys.

39:18.100 --> 39:19.600
- Yeah, he's not involved.
- I'm not here.

39:19.700 --> 39:21.000
When do we start?
How about tomorrow?

39:21.100 --> 39:22.700
Who's this guy?

39:22.800 --> 39:25.700
That's, uh, my associate,
he works for me.

39:25.800 --> 39:29.200
Well, did... rags!

39:29.300 --> 39:30.500
He's involved in this?

39:30.600 --> 39:33.000
Yeah... trust me, he's fine.

39:33.100 --> 39:35.100
You'll see him
and he'll be all right.

39:35.200 --> 39:37.100
Uh, rags, this is, uh...?

39:37.200 --> 39:40.200
- Rolly.
- Rolly. You know Frank.

39:40.300 --> 39:44.800
You guys should know something
about me... full disclosure.

39:44.900 --> 39:47.800
I, uh, on occasion...

39:48.900 --> 39:50.200
Will talk in my sleep.

39:50.300 --> 39:54.400
And I have a girlfriend
who, on occasion...

39:54.500 --> 39:57.200
Sleeps over.

39:57.300 --> 40:00.800
And, uh, she's got a big mouth.

40:00.900 --> 40:02.700
All right.
Looking forward to it, man.

40:10.500 --> 40:13.100
Button up, my friend.
Button up.

40:16.300 --> 40:18.300
- Hey, McKenzie.
- Hey, rolly.

40:18.500 --> 40:20.200
Can I have a word?

40:20.300 --> 40:21.900
Yeah, sure, sit down.

40:22.000 --> 40:23.100
Thank you.

40:23.200 --> 40:24.700
What's up?

40:24.900 --> 40:28.700
Well...
Here's the situation.

40:28.800 --> 40:30.400
You know I work for tibby

40:30.500 --> 40:34.800
and, uh, lately, she's been
sexually harassing me,

40:34.900 --> 40:36.600
putting her hand on my leg,

40:36.700 --> 40:39.300
dressing suggestively,
things of that nature.

40:39.400 --> 40:41.200
The point is,
I gotta get out of there.

40:41.300 --> 40:43.500
I was hoping maybe I could,
uh, get something with you.

40:43.600 --> 40:45.400
You're working on
Blue heron, right?

40:45.500 --> 40:47.900
Nah, I don't think so. No.

40:48.000 --> 40:50.100
I got a bunch of guys
I hire from a pool,

40:50.200 --> 40:51.700
guys I worked with before.

40:51.800 --> 40:57.000
You know, I hate
to bring this up, McKenzie.

40:57.100 --> 41:01.900
But, uh, I'm sure you'll
recall that a few years ago,

41:02.000 --> 41:06.000
I found your dog,
in the woods, behind my house

41:06.100 --> 41:08.400
and at the risk of my own
personal safety,

41:08.500 --> 41:09.700
I brought it back.

41:09.800 --> 41:12.200
I fed it and gave him
the rest of my meatloaf.

41:12.300 --> 41:13.900
And he had a baked potato.

41:14.000 --> 41:15.700
I didn't know dogs
ate baked potatoes.

41:15.800 --> 41:18.500
And then we sat down and we watched
an episode of <i>law & order.</i>

41:18.600 --> 41:20.300
And I fell asleep with
that poor dog in my arms.

41:20.400 --> 41:21.700
And he must've had
some dog dream

41:21.800 --> 41:24.200
because I woke up and he was
twitching and going like that.

41:24.300 --> 41:26.700
And then, I woke up in the
morning and I called you.

41:26.800 --> 41:30.600
You're saying I should give you
a job because you found my dog?

41:30.700 --> 41:32.400
I got lyme disease
from that night.

41:32.500 --> 41:33.800
I never told you about that.

41:33.900 --> 41:36.400
Ok. I'll tell you what...

41:36.500 --> 41:40.100
Only because I do appreciate
you saving lucky...

41:42.200 --> 41:44.400
- ...we'll try it out.
- I appreciate it.

41:44.500 --> 41:45.700
I won't let you down.
I'll work for you.

41:45.800 --> 41:47.100
I'll do a good job for you.

41:47.200 --> 41:48.700
Monday morning, eight o'clock.

41:48.800 --> 41:50.100
See you then.

41:50.200 --> 41:52.000
Eight o'clock.

42:03.700 --> 42:05.700
Uh, rolly,

42:05.800 --> 42:08.200
what are you doing?

42:08.300 --> 42:10.700
So, um...
I couldn't help but notice

42:10.800 --> 42:16.100
that my suggestion
has gone unheeded.

42:16.200 --> 42:20.000
I heard you,
and, uh, I just decided

42:20.100 --> 42:22.300
that I have
pretty good system here.

42:22.400 --> 42:23.700
Well, you just saw
what I have to do.

42:23.800 --> 42:25.800
I have to clean it in the water.

42:25.900 --> 42:28.800
Now I need more water.
We're in a vicious cycle here,

42:28.900 --> 42:32.800
of silverware into water,
into more water, on napkins.

42:32.900 --> 42:34.800
The whole thing can be avoided.

42:34.900 --> 42:37.300
It's disappointing.

42:37.400 --> 42:40.200
I gotta get going
because I've got other people

42:40.300 --> 42:41.500
I have to care of.

42:41.600 --> 42:44.200
- You look real good.
- Thank you.

42:44.300 --> 42:47.100
Sorry you had to wait.

42:47.200 --> 42:48.800
It's still hot.

42:48.900 --> 42:50.500
So, who are you having
lunch with there?

43:26.600 --> 43:27.700
Rolly.

43:27.800 --> 43:29.600
- Hey.
- I got the job.

43:29.700 --> 43:32.300
- Good going. Yeah!
- Thanks.

43:32.400 --> 43:35.000
- I'm gonna start Monday.
- Wow. That's fantastic.

43:35.100 --> 43:36.600
Thanks for the recommendation.
That was really nice of you.

43:36.700 --> 43:39.200
My pleasure. I told you
I was gonna keep my ears open.

43:39.300 --> 43:40.600
Yeah.

43:41.800 --> 43:43.900
- Good song.
- Awesome song.

43:45.600 --> 43:47.400
- You like this band?
- I love these guys.

43:47.500 --> 43:48.600
- Really?
- They're amazing.

43:48.700 --> 43:49.700
How much do you love them?

43:49.800 --> 43:51.600
I have four of the albums.

43:51.800 --> 43:53.500
- Really?
- Yeah.

43:53.600 --> 43:56.000
Huh. You go to the concert
here 20 years ago?

43:56.100 --> 43:57.700
- I did.
- Yeah.

43:57.800 --> 43:59.200
Me and my cousin Pam went.

43:59.300 --> 44:00.800
And how was it, you had fun?

44:00.900 --> 44:02.900
Oh, it was a great show.
They put on a great show.

44:02.900 --> 44:03.900
- Really?
- Yeah.

44:04.000 --> 44:06.200
And did you, by any chance,

44:06.300 --> 44:08.300
blow them afterwards?

44:31.100 --> 44:34.800
Yeah, let's really
get cracking on this wall, guys.

44:34.900 --> 44:37.500
I wanna see you fitting,
and I wanna see you chipping,

44:37.600 --> 44:39.200
I wanna see you on the machine.

44:39.300 --> 44:42.200
I wanna see some real work
done on that wall today...

44:42.300 --> 44:47.100
So, so sorry. Gentlemen,
so sorry I'm late.

44:47.300 --> 44:50.400
Trying to take a shower,
hot water didn't come on.

44:50.500 --> 44:51.500
Waiting, waiting.

44:51.600 --> 44:52.900
You know what
I'm talking about?

44:52.900 --> 44:54.500
Feeling, testing,
feeling, testing.

44:54.600 --> 44:57.800
The hot water,
it takes a year to get hot.

44:57.900 --> 45:01.200
I think you better put this on
while you're out here, ok?

45:01.300 --> 45:05.800
- Ok, you guys, let's go.
- Really? Look at this. Huh?

45:05.900 --> 45:08.200
- Ok, guys, let's get to work.
- Come on, get to work.

45:08.300 --> 45:09.500
Take a walk with me, will you?

45:09.600 --> 45:11.000
Remember Lee j. Cobb,
<i>on the waterfront?</i>

45:11.100 --> 45:14.000
"Get to work!
You get to work!"

45:14.100 --> 45:15.800
Never saw it.

45:15.900 --> 45:17.500
Look, I think I got
a job for you.

45:17.600 --> 45:18.900
- Yeah.
- It's not easy.

45:19.000 --> 45:21.800
I want you to finish assembling
this swing set, all right?

45:21.900 --> 45:24.900
First thing you do, dig some
holes, put concrete in there,

45:25.000 --> 45:26.600
then put your
four-by-four in there.

45:26.700 --> 45:28.100
Nothing to it.
Add water to that...

45:28.200 --> 45:29.700
That...?

45:29.800 --> 45:31.700
Yeah, yeah. And then
just put it in the hole, ok?

45:31.800 --> 45:33.200
Ok.

45:33.300 --> 45:35.300
I'll check in on you later.

45:35.400 --> 45:36.700
- No need.
- No, no.

45:36.800 --> 45:38.700
- No need, I'm good.
- No. I'll check back.

45:38.800 --> 45:41.200
Don't come back!

45:46.800 --> 45:48.300
Aah!

46:00.400 --> 46:01.700
Hey!

46:01.800 --> 46:04.000
McKenzie!

46:04.100 --> 46:05.600
Wee!

46:05.700 --> 46:08.500
Aw, fuck!

46:12.100 --> 46:15.700
Excuse me.
Where's the bathroom?

46:15.800 --> 46:18.400
Mr. cesspool.

46:27.100 --> 46:29.400
Excuse me. Sorry.

46:29.500 --> 46:30.800
Are you the heating guy?

46:30.900 --> 46:36.200
I'm not the heating guy
per se, but I do heat.

46:36.300 --> 46:37.900
So you can look at my system.

46:38.000 --> 46:39.100
- Sure. Yeah.
- Great.

46:39.200 --> 46:40.400
Thank you so much.

46:40.500 --> 46:42.500
I've been having
real issues with it...

46:42.600 --> 46:44.300
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- Watch the cord here

46:44.400 --> 46:47.300
because I can't
seem to get behind the couch

46:47.400 --> 46:48.700
for the outlet.

46:48.900 --> 46:50.300
You got an outlet
behind the couch?

46:50.400 --> 46:52.500
They're always
behind the furniture.

46:52.600 --> 46:54.000
- Not in my house.
- Really?

46:54.100 --> 46:57.500
In my house,
my outlets are eye level.

46:57.600 --> 47:00.500
There's no bending down.
There's no moving furniture.

47:00.600 --> 47:02.200
There's no injuring backs.

47:02.300 --> 47:04.700
Ok. That's a great idea.

47:04.800 --> 47:06.300
I'm gonna talk
to McKenzie about that.

47:06.300 --> 47:07.700
You don't... you don't
need to talk to him.

47:07.800 --> 47:09.400
Yeah, no, I think I should.

47:09.500 --> 47:11.100
- I'll mention to him.
- Ok, great.

47:11.200 --> 47:13.200
- Yeah, don't talk to him...
- Ok, please do.

47:13.300 --> 47:16.700
So listen, this is
what happens here.

47:16.800 --> 47:18.100
Yeah.

47:18.200 --> 47:20.500
See that, that's the temperature
it stays at all the time,

47:20.600 --> 47:23.400
so whether it's cool
or whether it's hot.

47:23.500 --> 47:25.700
- Uh-huh.
- So it just stays there.

47:25.800 --> 47:28.200
It doesn't matter
if it's on 68 or 78,

47:28.300 --> 47:29.800
it just is always
that temperature.

47:29.900 --> 47:33.000
And I have no idea why...
There's an asterisk,

47:33.100 --> 47:36.000
the asterisk,
it's a sort of a warning.

47:36.100 --> 47:37.400
It's saying, "we're coming on."

47:37.500 --> 47:39.900
Get ready,
we're gonna be warm soon."

47:40.000 --> 47:42.400
Or "we're gonna be cooler,"
you know.

47:42.500 --> 47:44.000
Can we just fix it?

47:44.100 --> 47:48.000
I'm on it. On it.

47:48.100 --> 47:49.700
- Rhonda!
- Yeah?

47:49.800 --> 47:51.400
- I'm sorry. Hold on.
- Rhonda!

47:51.500 --> 47:52.900
Hey, have you seen
my gray jacket,

47:53.000 --> 47:54.800
the new one that I just got
with a black liner?

47:54.900 --> 47:57.400
No. But why don't
you put on the seersucker.

47:57.500 --> 47:59.000
I got it for your birthday,
it looks so...

47:59.100 --> 48:00.400
I would put
the seersucker jacket on,

48:00.500 --> 48:02.600
but my barbershop quartet
license just expired.

48:02.700 --> 48:04.700
Well, you don't need to take
that kind of attitude.

48:04.700 --> 48:06.300
- Rhonda!
- You know I don't like that.

48:06.400 --> 48:09.100
I don't like it either. I've
had it with this whole thing.

48:09.200 --> 48:10.400
Don't you talk like that...

48:10.500 --> 48:11.600
We're done!

48:11.700 --> 48:13.600
- Will, open the door.
- No, no!

48:13.700 --> 48:16.100
Will, you've got
to stop doing this.

48:27.800 --> 48:29.200
I was coming
out of the bathroom

48:29.300 --> 48:30.600
and she asked me
if I was the heating guy

48:30.700 --> 48:31.900
and now I'm in the house.

48:32.000 --> 48:34.100
- That's great.
- Well done, newcomer.

48:34.200 --> 48:35.400
Thank you, stumpo.

48:35.500 --> 48:37.600
- I'm proud of you.
- Stumpo's proud of me.

48:37.700 --> 48:40.600
He's never proud of people.
He doesn't dole out complements.

48:40.700 --> 48:43.300
I don't like anybody. Go ahead
with your story, though.

48:43.400 --> 48:44.700
It's not really a story.

48:44.800 --> 48:46.500
I'm just saying
I'm in the house.

48:46.600 --> 48:48.500
- Yeah.
- That's the end of the story.

48:48.600 --> 48:50.800
It's not a story.
I didn't say it was a story.

48:50.900 --> 48:53.500
- It's kind of a story.
- It's a nice story.

48:53.600 --> 48:56.000
Anyway, this is perfect.

48:56.100 --> 48:58.100
She's complained
about the heating system.

48:58.200 --> 49:00.600
We'll make it look
like a gas explosion.

49:00.700 --> 49:02.900
We already have an alibi.

49:03.000 --> 49:06.700
Hey, by the way, did you ever
hear a rumor about Wendy

49:06.900 --> 49:09.400
blowing Chicago 20 years ago
when they were here?

49:09.500 --> 49:13.600
Oh, yeah, she did.
Yep. That's a fact.

49:13.700 --> 49:15.000
How do you know this?

49:15.100 --> 49:18.000
My sister was there, saw it
happen. She blew them too.

49:18.100 --> 49:19.700
How is Roberta doing?

49:19.800 --> 49:21.600
- She's doing good.
- That's great.

49:21.700 --> 49:25.300
Yeah. Now, you're
gonna need a detonator.

49:25.400 --> 49:27.800
- I have to get the detonator?
- You gotta get a detonator.

49:27.800 --> 49:29.800
- I'm not involved in this.
- Yeah.

49:29.900 --> 49:32.600
I made the introductions,
but I was under the impression

49:32.700 --> 49:35.100
that you guys were taking care
of all that kind of shit.

49:35.200 --> 49:36.800
Well, you're
under the wrong impression.

49:36.900 --> 49:38.700
How much is a detonator?

49:38.800 --> 49:40.400
Not much.

49:40.500 --> 49:42.700
What's not much?

49:42.800 --> 49:44.600
I don't know,
just not a lot of money.

49:44.700 --> 49:46.700
What's not a lot of money?

49:46.800 --> 49:48.100
I don't know.
What do you think?

49:48.300 --> 49:49.400
What's a detonator gonna run?

49:49.400 --> 49:50.800
- Not much.
- Yeah.

49:50.900 --> 49:52.700
Ok. So you guys don't know
what a detonator cost, do you?

49:52.800 --> 49:54.200
- No, no...
- You have no idea.

49:54.300 --> 49:56.400
- We know what a detonator cost.
- You have no idea...

49:57.500 --> 49:59.500
We've been around detonators,
trust us, we know.

49:59.600 --> 50:01.200
We know exactly how much
it cost, it cost nothing.

50:01.300 --> 50:03.300
It's not very important.
You're fixated on this.

50:03.400 --> 50:05.000
Don't worry, it's nothing.

50:05.100 --> 50:06.700
Where is he supposed
to get a detonator?

50:06.700 --> 50:08.800
I know a guy.

50:08.900 --> 50:10.600
Oh, that haney's such a jerk.

50:10.700 --> 50:12.400
You should see
how he treats his wife.

50:12.500 --> 50:14.700
Does he ever see you
around the house?

50:14.800 --> 50:17.300
Yeah. Yeah. He thinks
I'm the heating guy.

50:17.400 --> 50:19.100
He doesn't have any idea
who you are?

50:19.200 --> 50:21.100
Oh, wait.

50:23.000 --> 50:25.900
- Is this him?
- There he is.

50:26.000 --> 50:28.700
My God, he's got a Howard?

50:28.800 --> 50:30.600
Oh, he went with
the orange one.

50:32.200 --> 50:34.500
Should I get out?

50:46.500 --> 50:48.000
I'm rolly.

50:48.100 --> 50:50.000
I'm tibor.

50:50.100 --> 50:52.400
Nice to meet you.

50:52.500 --> 50:54.100
You want detonator?

50:55.200 --> 50:56.300
What's that accent?

50:56.400 --> 50:57.900
I'm from chechnya.

50:58.000 --> 51:01.200
- Ah, chechnya.
- You have been to chechnya?

51:01.300 --> 51:02.800
Tibor, I haven't been
to chechnya,

51:02.900 --> 51:05.600
and may I be perfectly honest,
I mean no disrespect,

51:05.700 --> 51:09.500
I never had any desire to go.

51:09.600 --> 51:12.800
- You bring money?
- How much is a detonator?

51:12.900 --> 51:14.800
One thousand dollars.

51:14.900 --> 51:19.100
Really? Hmm,
$1,000 seems a tad pricey.

51:19.200 --> 51:20.800
Oh, you have bought
detonator before?

51:20.900 --> 51:23.200
- No.
- So how do you know price of detonator?

51:23.300 --> 51:25.300
It's like if you go on
the price is right

51:25.400 --> 51:27.500
and they bring out
a television.

51:27.600 --> 51:29.700
You have to guess
what this thing cost.

51:29.800 --> 51:31.800
Some people are off
by thousands of dollars.

51:31.900 --> 51:34.100
You guess 1,000 and it's 6,000.

51:34.200 --> 51:35.900
If I'm on <i>the price is right,</i>

51:36.000 --> 51:40.400
and they bring out
the detonator, I'm saying $600,

51:40.500 --> 51:44.100
- $500...
- Shut the fuck up!

51:44.200 --> 51:46.100
All right. Ok.

51:50.200 --> 51:52.100
You know, when you get older,

51:52.200 --> 51:54.300
it's not so easy
to go through the bills anymore.

51:54.400 --> 51:55.700
That's why you see old people,

51:55.800 --> 51:57.200
you know,
they always go like this.

51:57.300 --> 51:59.100
I'm starting to go
like this now.

51:59.200 --> 52:01.700
This all the time,
you know, like fagin.

52:01.800 --> 52:03.600
I'm doing this.

52:03.700 --> 52:06.000
There you go.

52:07.400 --> 52:09.200
This is detonator.

52:09.300 --> 52:11.800
- Ok, this is it, huh?
- Good luck.

52:15.800 --> 52:18.200
<i>Hi, tibor.</i>

52:24.300 --> 52:25.900
- Oh, shit.
- What the fuck?

52:31.600 --> 52:33.900
What the fuck?
What the fuck?

52:34.000 --> 52:36.100
You waved me to go
and then you hit me.

52:36.200 --> 52:38.800
No. No, I didn't wave you to go.
I waved good-bye.

52:38.900 --> 52:40.000
That's good-bye.

52:40.100 --> 52:41.700
It was not good-bye.
It was not this.

52:41.800 --> 52:43.600
It was like this,
like go. You said go.

52:43.700 --> 52:45.700
- No, I didn't say go.
- I went and you hit me.

52:45.800 --> 52:48.700
No, tibor, I did not say go!
I said good-bye.

52:48.800 --> 52:51.500
Go, if I said go,
I would have gone go, go, go.

52:51.600 --> 52:54.000
This is good-bye.
How do you misinterpret that?

52:54.100 --> 52:56.200
Why would you wave
good-bye to me?

52:56.300 --> 52:57.500
I don't fucking know you.

52:57.600 --> 52:59.100
What do you mean
why would I wave good-bye?

52:59.200 --> 53:02.500
It's polite. We had
an encounter, we talked.

53:02.600 --> 53:06.800
I will get estimate,
ok, for Howard.

53:06.900 --> 53:10.800
I will find you
and you will pay.

53:14.500 --> 53:15.900
Hey, rolly.

53:16.000 --> 53:18.000
Hey. You wanted to see me?

53:18.100 --> 53:19.400
Um, yeah.

53:19.500 --> 53:21.500
Uh, it was a little
chilly last night

53:21.600 --> 53:24.800
and I just wanted to know
how it's going.

53:25.000 --> 53:26.700
Well, first of all,
I'm really sorry about that,

53:26.800 --> 53:28.200
but I gotta tell you something.

53:28.300 --> 53:29.500
I'm working overtime
on this thing.

53:29.600 --> 53:30.800
I'm sure.

53:30.900 --> 53:33.400
The problem is the, um,

53:33.500 --> 53:37.200
ecto-plexmatic tubes are
not connected, uh, properly.

53:42.700 --> 53:43.900
- You know what?
- Hmm?

53:44.000 --> 53:45.900
Come with me because it's...

53:46.000 --> 53:47.600
I left my hammer in the gym,

53:47.700 --> 53:49.500
and I'll explain
the whole thing to you.

53:49.600 --> 53:51.200
But you've got
a hammer on your belt.

53:51.300 --> 53:52.800
No, my lucky hammer.

53:54.700 --> 53:56.300
Can I ask you a question?

53:56.400 --> 53:59.100
Do you know anything
about this fair on Saturday?

53:59.200 --> 54:00.800
Oh.
Are you kidding?

54:00.900 --> 54:02.400
- The fair, of course.
- Yeah?

54:02.500 --> 54:03.800
They have it once a year,

54:03.900 --> 54:05.400
and everybody
on the island goes.

54:05.500 --> 54:07.400
It's fun.
You know, there's rides

54:07.500 --> 54:09.100
and there's a dunking booth,
you ever see one of those?

54:09.200 --> 54:10.400
I love the dunking booth.

54:10.500 --> 54:12.800
The dunking booth,
and they got like, best pig.

54:12.900 --> 54:15.100
- Ok.
- And best Danish.

54:17.300 --> 54:19.800
Oh God,
it feels so good to laugh.

54:19.900 --> 54:21.600
You know what?

54:21.700 --> 54:23.800
My husband's leaving
this weekend.

54:23.900 --> 54:25.300
I think that's
what I'm gonna do.

54:25.400 --> 54:28.200
I'm gonna go to the fair
on Saturday. I'm gonna do it.

54:28.300 --> 54:30.600
You know what,
you're a real vineyarder now.

54:30.700 --> 54:31.900
- Mrs. haney?
- Uh-huh.

54:32.000 --> 54:33.500
There's a package here
you need to sign for.

54:33.600 --> 54:35.700
Ok, great. Um...

54:35.800 --> 54:38.300
- See ya.
- Bye, rolly.

54:45.500 --> 54:48.500
Yeah.

54:48.600 --> 54:50.100
<i>- Hey, stumpo.</i>
<i>- Hey.</i>

54:50.200 --> 54:51.600
<i>Ok, get this.</i>

54:51.700 --> 54:54.300
Haney is gonna be
out of town this weekend.

54:54.400 --> 54:57.000
His wife is gonna be
at the fair all day Saturday.

54:57.100 --> 54:58.500
The house is gonna be empty.

54:58.600 --> 55:01.500
<i>You can do your recon,</i>
<i>take pictures, scope it out.</i>

55:01.700 --> 55:04.300
Beautiful. Ok, we'll case
the place on Saturday night.

55:04.400 --> 55:06.100
Ok, see you.

55:07.700 --> 55:09.200
I'm gonna follow
her from the gate...

55:09.300 --> 55:10.800
- Right.
- ...Over to the fair.

55:10.900 --> 55:13.200
If I see that she's heading
back, I'm gonna text you.

55:13.300 --> 55:14.500
That should give you
plenty of time to get out.

55:14.600 --> 55:16.200
All right.

55:16.300 --> 55:18.300
Well, I gotta pee.

55:20.200 --> 55:22.900
See, they should have
pee flaps in cars.

55:23.000 --> 55:26.300
Pee flaps... a little
flap, a cylindrical tube,

55:26.400 --> 55:28.400
you pee right into the tube.

55:28.500 --> 55:30.800
Wouldn't that be a great idea?

55:30.900 --> 55:33.200
- Where does it go?
- Yeah, where would it go?

55:33.300 --> 55:35.700
- Can't just let it out.
- Yeah. The same set-up as an airplane.

55:35.800 --> 55:37.200
I don't think
you thought this through.

55:37.300 --> 55:38.200
I'm just gonna be
honest with you.

55:38.300 --> 55:39.900
There'll be piss
all over the roads?

55:40.000 --> 55:41.900
Just use a bottle
like everybody else.

55:42.000 --> 55:45.100
No. That one astronaut tried
to kill that other astronaut

55:45.200 --> 55:47.600
- and she drove cross-country in a diaper.
- Oh, yeah.

55:47.700 --> 55:49.100
That's a good idea,
a car diaper.

55:49.200 --> 55:52.000
You do a car diaper, that makes
more sense than a pee flap.

55:52.100 --> 55:54.600
A car diaper? That's
the worst idea ever.

55:54.700 --> 55:55.700
You sell them at gas stations...

55:55.800 --> 55:57.100
Hey, hey, hey.
There she is.

55:57.200 --> 55:58.800
Get out, get out, get out.

55:58.900 --> 56:01.100
I'll text you.

56:22.600 --> 56:26.100
Well, well, well.
What a surprise, rolly.

56:26.200 --> 56:28.200
Hey. Fancy meeting
you here.

56:28.300 --> 56:29.500
- Meeting you, yeah.
- Yeah.

56:29.600 --> 56:31.900
You know that swing set
I asked you to put together?

56:32.000 --> 56:33.200
- Yeah.
- It collapsed.

56:33.300 --> 56:34.800
I know.
I know all about that.

56:34.900 --> 56:37.200
Yeah. Did you know there
were a lot of kids on it?

56:37.300 --> 56:39.700
Did you know two of them are
in the hospital right now?

56:39.800 --> 56:41.800
I followed
all the instructions.

56:41.900 --> 56:43.300
You're fired.

56:43.400 --> 56:45.500
- What?
- That's right, you're fired.

56:45.600 --> 56:47.500
Turn in your helmet.

56:47.600 --> 56:50.900
If anybody is getting fired,
McKenzie, it's gonna be you.

56:51.000 --> 56:54.000
Rolly here has fixed
my exo-plasmatic tube

56:54.100 --> 56:55.900
and done wonders
on your shoddy work.

56:56.000 --> 56:57.800
"Ecto" what?
I'm sorry...

56:57.900 --> 57:00.500
The flagellator... we can't
even find the flagellator.

57:00.600 --> 57:03.900
- The "flaga" what?
- And the exo-plagmatic tube.

57:04.000 --> 57:05.900
The heat has not been working

57:06.000 --> 57:07.300
since I arrived
in this house, McKenzie.

57:07.400 --> 57:08.800
I will take care of it.

57:08.900 --> 57:10.400
If you're gonna fire anybody,

57:10.500 --> 57:12.700
you're gonna come to me first
and you're gonna ask me.

57:12.700 --> 57:15.100
- I'll take care of everything.
- Well, you better get on it.

57:15.200 --> 57:17.600
- That's why I hired you.
- Nice to see you, Mrs. haney.

57:17.700 --> 57:19.100
Yeah, nice to see you too.

57:19.200 --> 57:20.700
Enjoy the fair.

57:20.800 --> 57:23.400
I'm so sorry about that, rolly.

57:23.500 --> 57:25.700
Blaming me for the swings?

57:25.800 --> 57:27.900
Those poor kids.
I felt so horrible.

57:28.000 --> 57:29.800
I feel so much
guilt about that.

57:29.900 --> 57:31.900
I'm gonna visit those kids
in the hospital tomorrow.

57:32.000 --> 57:33.400
- You are?
- I am.

57:33.500 --> 57:35.200
- That's so sweet.
- Yeah.

57:35.300 --> 57:37.500
By the way,
this is very fortuitous...

57:37.600 --> 57:38.600
This is.

57:38.700 --> 57:40.600
I must say,
bumping into you like this.

57:40.700 --> 57:42.000
Excellent.

57:42.100 --> 57:44.100
We should take in
the fair together.

57:44.300 --> 57:46.200
- Let's do it.
- Oh, great.

57:49.900 --> 57:51.600
Hey! Look at that!

57:51.700 --> 57:54.300
- Right for the one I aimed...
- That was unbelievable!

57:54.400 --> 57:56.000
What's over there?

57:56.100 --> 57:58.300
That's all you got?

57:58.400 --> 58:00.100
Come on. You can throw
better than that one.

58:00.200 --> 58:01.600
Come on!

58:01.700 --> 58:03.900
Hey, Mrs. Lee,
I want my nails do.

58:03.900 --> 58:07.800
Oh, look who's here.
I wanna talk... ooh!

58:18.000 --> 58:19.700
Oh, it's disgusting.

58:19.800 --> 58:21.000
No, I'm literally
gonna throw up.

58:21.100 --> 58:22.300
How could you drag me here?

58:22.400 --> 58:25.200
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

58:25.300 --> 58:27.200
Here's the itinerary, ok?

58:27.300 --> 58:28.200
Ok.

58:28.300 --> 58:30.000
Ferris wheel next,

58:30.100 --> 58:31.500
then we go
right to the big tent.

58:31.600 --> 58:32.700
Oh, that's cute.

58:32.800 --> 58:36.200
- Oh. Oh, yeah...
- Who's Bartholomew gosnold?

58:36.300 --> 58:39.000
He's the founder
of the vineyard, and Martha is

58:39.100 --> 58:40.800
his grandmother,
maybe his daughter.

58:40.900 --> 58:42.100
I don't know.

58:42.200 --> 58:44.000
- Martha's vineyard.
- Yes, yes.

58:44.100 --> 58:45.500
Ah, of course.

58:45.600 --> 58:47.400
Are you thinking
what I'm thinking?

58:47.500 --> 58:50.000
Let's do it.
Let's be pilgrims.

58:50.100 --> 58:53.000
- Pilgrims?
- Yes.

59:12.000 --> 59:15.400
- Really looking forward...
- I got it. I'm gonna get it.

59:15.500 --> 59:16.600
- Come on.
- Let me get it.

59:16.700 --> 59:18.500
- No!
- I'm doing it.

59:18.600 --> 59:20.600
Hi, um...

59:27.000 --> 59:29.500
Yeah, look at you over there.

59:29.600 --> 59:31.500
Taking pictures.

59:31.600 --> 59:33.800
Must be nice, huh?

59:33.900 --> 59:35.400
Come around here,

59:35.500 --> 59:38.800
pretend to be
somebody else, huh?

59:38.900 --> 59:41.000
You just jump in another
motherfucker's body, huh?

59:43.100 --> 59:44.400
Oh, look at this on my phone!

59:44.500 --> 59:46.800
Motherfucker named Nathan.

59:46.900 --> 59:49.000
I knew your ass looked
familiar to me.

59:49.100 --> 59:50.300
- How you doing, Nathan?
- Shh! Quiet.

59:50.400 --> 59:52.100
No, you be quiet.

59:52.200 --> 59:54.000
You know what
Jennifer told me now?

59:54.100 --> 59:55.500
That she wants her space.

59:55.600 --> 59:57.200
You put that shit in her head.

59:57.300 --> 59:59.500
"Space" means "I wanna be
with somebody different."

59:59.600 --> 01:00:01.600
No, no. She's saying
she wants her space.

01:00:01.700 --> 01:00:04.300
It's like space.
You're alone in space,

01:00:04.400 --> 01:00:05.800
the planets aren't
near each other.

01:00:05.900 --> 01:00:10.500
It's the black void of being
alone in a black void.

01:00:10.600 --> 01:00:13.000
So no one wants to be
near a black void?

01:00:13.100 --> 01:00:15.600
- I'm a black-ass void now?
- No, you're not a black void.

01:00:15.700 --> 01:00:18.100
You're talking about me. I'm
the blackest motherfucker here.

01:00:18.100 --> 01:00:20.200
- You're not a black void!
- Man, I'm about to smash

01:00:20.300 --> 01:00:21.800
the rest of that fucking hair
out your goddamn head.

01:00:21.900 --> 01:00:23.200
I can read between
the lines and shit.

01:00:23.300 --> 01:00:24.600
Oh, no. That's crazy.

01:00:24.700 --> 01:00:28.200
You fuck my life up, I will
fuck your life up, Nathan.

01:00:28.400 --> 01:00:29.700
Tit for tat.

01:00:29.800 --> 01:00:32.100
Tit for tat? There's no tat,
there was no tit.

01:00:32.200 --> 01:00:35.300
If I see Jennifer
with another man,

01:00:35.400 --> 01:00:37.100
going fucking crabbing,

01:00:37.200 --> 01:00:39.200
antiquing, getting
pushed on a swing,

01:00:39.300 --> 01:00:42.500
this whole charade you're
doing right now, it's over.

01:00:42.600 --> 01:00:46.600
I'm telling everybody, Nathan.

01:00:58.800 --> 01:01:02.000
Ok. Oh, that's funny.
That's a funny story.

01:01:02.100 --> 01:01:03.800
- Ha ha.
- What a funny story.

01:01:03.900 --> 01:01:05.900
- This is my friend, rolly.
- See you later. Take care.

01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:07.800
Ok. You're
gonna friend me, ok.

01:01:07.900 --> 01:01:09.000
Get lost.

01:01:09.100 --> 01:01:10.700
Don't forget.
I'm gonna Facebook you for sure.

01:01:10.800 --> 01:01:13.100
Ok. Take care.
What's going on here?

01:01:13.200 --> 01:01:14.600
- Oh, having fun.
- You're having fun?

01:01:14.700 --> 01:01:16.600
Meeting people, thanks to you.

01:01:16.700 --> 01:01:18.200
What about jaspar?

01:01:18.300 --> 01:01:19.800
I don't wanna have
just one man.

01:01:19.900 --> 01:01:21.200
It's the time
to have fun for me.

01:01:21.300 --> 01:01:22.500
Thanks to what you told me,

01:01:22.600 --> 01:01:24.600
you made, like,
a light go off in my head.

01:01:24.700 --> 01:01:26.000
Ok. It was
a stupid thing to say.

01:01:26.100 --> 01:01:27.500
Jaspar's nice
for somebody else.

01:01:27.600 --> 01:01:30.400
I wanna, you know,
I wanna see what's outside.

01:01:30.500 --> 01:01:32.600
I got some news
for you, baby. Ok?

01:01:33.400 --> 01:01:35.200
You're gonna gain
the weight back.

01:01:35.300 --> 01:01:37.600
Then there's not gonna be any
jaspar, then you're gonna be alone.

01:01:37.700 --> 01:01:39.300
You're gonna gain
the weight back.

01:01:39.400 --> 01:01:41.500
What is that...
Why do you gotta say that?

01:01:41.600 --> 01:01:43.600
What do you mean? You're going
to, that's what happens.

01:01:43.700 --> 01:01:45.400
Nature abhors a vacuum.

01:01:45.500 --> 01:01:48.500
- It wants to fill up...
- It wants to pour the vacuum.

01:01:48.600 --> 01:01:50.100
No?

01:01:50.200 --> 01:01:53.100
Doesn't a vacuum suck
something up,

01:01:53.200 --> 01:01:54.400
like when you vacuum?

01:01:54.500 --> 01:01:55.900
You're gonna get fat again.

01:01:56.000 --> 01:01:57.300
Well, you know what?
I changed my lifestyle,

01:01:57.400 --> 01:01:58.700
I'm not gonna gain
the weight back. Ok?

01:01:58.800 --> 01:02:00.000
You wanna make a little bet?

01:02:00.100 --> 01:02:02.400
- I'll make a big bet. - Yeah, how much?
- Not a little one, let's make a big one.

01:02:02.400 --> 01:02:03.400
I'll make a big one.
Fifty bucks.

01:02:03.400 --> 01:02:05.100
- Fantastic. That's it?
- Yeah, that's it.

01:02:05.300 --> 01:02:07.700
- I'll do more.
- Fifty bucks.

01:02:07.800 --> 01:02:09.200
Just do me one favor.

01:02:09.300 --> 01:02:11.200
Before you start dating
other men,

01:02:11.300 --> 01:02:13.400
will you just think about it?

01:02:13.500 --> 01:02:16.100
Give it a little time.
You claim to want your space.

01:02:16.200 --> 01:02:17.800
Well, now give it some time.

01:02:17.900 --> 01:02:20.200
Time and space, they work
together. They're partners.

01:02:21.800 --> 01:02:23.200
How much time do I need to?

01:02:23.300 --> 01:02:24.300
A long time.

01:02:24.400 --> 01:02:25.800
- A long time?
- Yes.

01:02:25.900 --> 01:02:27.500
Take my time.
Be by myself.

01:02:27.600 --> 01:02:29.100
- Yeah.
- I'll think about it.

01:02:29.200 --> 01:02:30.900
- Ok. Come on.
- Let me give you a call.

01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:32.700
- You deserve a free coffee.
- Give me a hug. Ok.

01:02:32.800 --> 01:02:34.800
- Ok. This is fantastic.
- Ok.

01:02:34.900 --> 01:02:36.500
You're gonna think about it.

01:02:36.600 --> 01:02:37.900
What kind of coffee you want?

01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:39.800
- A vanilla latte.
- I'll make it myself.

01:02:39.900 --> 01:02:41.200
- Ok.
- Ok.

01:02:41.300 --> 01:02:42.800
Vanilla latte!

01:02:47.500 --> 01:02:49.100
What are you doing here?

01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:51.700
I have estimate for you.

01:02:51.900 --> 01:02:53.900
What is this? Have
you been following me?

01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:55.800
This is not important to you.

01:02:55.900 --> 01:02:57.500
What is important to you is

01:02:57.600 --> 01:02:59.900
I am here
and I have estimate for you.

01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:01.600
- Ok.
- Ok.

01:03:01.600 --> 01:03:03.000
How much is the estimate?

01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:04.700
Thirteen-hundred dollars.

01:03:04.800 --> 01:03:07.100
Really?
Thirteen-hundred dollars?

01:03:07.200 --> 01:03:09.800
- This is what it costs.
- Where'd you get this estimate?

01:03:10.900 --> 01:03:13.100
I got it from vlad's body shop.

01:03:13.200 --> 01:03:16.300
- Vlad is a chechen.
- What's the problem?

01:03:16.400 --> 01:03:18.500
You're in chechen cahoots.

01:03:18.600 --> 01:03:20.700
- No, it's chechen coincidence.
- Oh, that's a coincidence?

01:03:20.800 --> 01:03:22.500
- I want to ask you something.
- Yeah.

01:03:22.600 --> 01:03:23.800
You have problem
with chechen people?

01:03:23.900 --> 01:03:25.500
Me? Are you kidding?

01:03:25.600 --> 01:03:26.900
I adore the chechen people.

01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:28.900
You're one of my top
five ethnic groups.

01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:31.200
- Really? Listen to me.
- Yeah.

01:03:31.300 --> 01:03:33.700
I don't have time to fucking
talk with you all day.

01:03:33.800 --> 01:03:35.500
No, of course not.

01:03:35.600 --> 01:03:38.000
You pay the money
or you have big fucking problem.

01:03:38.100 --> 01:03:41.000
One vanilla latte.

01:03:42.500 --> 01:03:44.000
Hey, thank you.

01:03:44.100 --> 01:03:45.700
- It's on the house.
- You're sweet. Thank you.

01:03:45.800 --> 01:03:47.800
Enjoy the fair, rolly.

01:03:49.200 --> 01:03:51.100
So what is this Cuban coffee?

01:03:51.200 --> 01:03:53.200
Oh, look at this.

01:03:53.300 --> 01:03:54.800
It's funny, isn't it?

01:03:54.900 --> 01:03:56.300
What a great picture.

01:03:56.400 --> 01:03:59.000
Um...
So I'm gonna head home.

01:03:59.100 --> 01:04:01.400
What? No.
You can't do that.

01:04:01.500 --> 01:04:04.100
- Really?
- May I ask a question?

01:04:04.200 --> 01:04:06.200
Sure, rolly.

01:04:06.300 --> 01:04:08.700
When was the last time
you were on a Ferris wheel?

01:04:08.800 --> 01:04:10.500
- Really?
- Yes. Here.

01:04:10.600 --> 01:04:12.000
- All right. All right.
- Come on.

01:04:12.100 --> 01:04:15.600
Ferris wheel and there's
piglets to see too.

01:04:15.700 --> 01:04:17.500
- There are piglets?
- There's little piglets.

01:04:17.600 --> 01:04:20.800
Ok.
Let's do it.

01:04:23.900 --> 01:04:26.200
Give me a measurement,
right here, of the duct.

01:04:26.300 --> 01:04:30.000
Here, hold on.
It's from rolly.

01:04:30.100 --> 01:04:32.300
"I can't hold her much longer."

01:04:32.400 --> 01:04:35.600
All right. Come on.
Let's hustle it up.

01:04:41.600 --> 01:04:43.700
- Yes!
- Huh?

01:04:43.800 --> 01:04:45.700
Huh? What did I tell you?

01:04:45.800 --> 01:04:47.900
- That was so much fun.
- That was excellent.

01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:50.100
I haven't done that in so long.

01:04:50.200 --> 01:04:52.500
What?
Because of the silverware?

01:05:04.500 --> 01:05:07.000
- No. That is not...
- But it's neon, it's cute.

01:05:07.100 --> 01:05:10.500
It's not you. You know, you're
lighting up, "I'm an asshole."

01:05:10.600 --> 01:05:13.200
White's a good color.
I like white.

01:05:13.300 --> 01:05:16.100
A little fur
with those little tie things.

01:05:16.200 --> 01:05:17.600
I don't know...

01:05:17.700 --> 01:05:19.800
Hey, you know what?
Let's get outta here.

01:05:19.900 --> 01:05:22.300
Wait, wait.
I wanna get a hat.

01:05:24.800 --> 01:05:26.100
- I don't think so.
- No? Nothing?

01:05:26.200 --> 01:05:27.700
- No.
- Ok. Well...

01:05:27.800 --> 01:05:30.900
I'm not a hat person?
He doesn't like me in hats.

01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:32.300
Well, if she really
wanted to buy it,

01:05:32.400 --> 01:05:33.900
she would have bought it.

01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:36.800
She's blaming it on me.
I had nothing to do with this.

01:05:36.900 --> 01:05:39.500
You know, except for the rides

01:05:39.600 --> 01:05:41.900
and then the food, it was
actually pretty good.

01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:44.800
- I can't believe the junk you ate.
- Made me so happy.

01:05:44.900 --> 01:05:46.800
It's unbelievable.

01:05:46.900 --> 01:05:48.400
How are my teeth?

01:05:48.500 --> 01:05:50.700
Good?

01:05:50.800 --> 01:05:52.400
I think you're ok?

01:05:52.500 --> 01:05:54.200
Let me see your teeth,
let me see.

01:05:54.300 --> 01:05:57.100
- Hmm. You're good.
- Yeah?

01:05:57.200 --> 01:05:59.100
You have a... hold on...
A little smudge.

01:06:00.900 --> 01:06:02.800
There.

01:06:02.900 --> 01:06:04.500
All right.

01:06:04.600 --> 01:06:08.600
This was the best day,
excellent.

01:06:08.700 --> 01:06:11.500
So, good night.
I'll see you at the house.

01:06:11.600 --> 01:06:12.700
- Ok.
- Ok.

01:06:34.400 --> 01:06:36.100
New plan.

01:06:37.300 --> 01:06:39.200
Instead of blowing up
the house,

01:06:39.300 --> 01:06:41.900
I'm gonna steal haney's wife,

01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:45.900
marry her and take
half his money.

01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:47.400
Oh, you gotta be...

01:06:47.500 --> 01:06:49.900
- What? Is this a joke?
- It's not a joke. No.

01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:51.800
It's not a joke?
It's stupid.

01:06:51.900 --> 01:06:54.200
You think she's gonna leave
her young, handsome,

01:06:54.300 --> 01:06:56.300
- billionaire husband...
- Oh, yes.

01:06:56.400 --> 01:06:57.900
For a broke, bald old dude?

01:06:58.000 --> 01:07:01.600
I know when I have a connection
with somebody, ok?

01:07:03.500 --> 01:07:04.600
This woman likes me.
Really?

01:07:04.700 --> 01:07:06.700
Oh, it's there. It's there.

01:07:08.200 --> 01:07:10.500
I love you so much.

01:07:10.600 --> 01:07:13.200
I love you so much.

01:07:14.400 --> 01:07:16.900
I have to tell you something.

01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:19.700
I spoke to the doctor...

01:07:21.700 --> 01:07:26.500
And I've decided to stop
the treatments.

01:07:26.600 --> 01:07:28.500
Oh, no.

01:07:28.600 --> 01:07:29.700
No, no, no.

01:07:29.800 --> 01:07:31.600
No! No!

01:07:32.600 --> 01:07:34.100
I took her to the fair
yesterday.

01:07:34.200 --> 01:07:35.800
She asked me for a tooth check.

01:07:35.900 --> 01:07:37.700
A tooth check, come on.

01:07:37.800 --> 01:07:39.500
- It means nothing.
- Who the fuck cares? That's means nothing.

01:07:39.600 --> 01:07:40.700
Rags will give me a tooth check.

01:07:40.800 --> 01:07:42.100
All the time.

01:07:42.200 --> 01:07:44.000
- Right...
- You guys do tooth checks?

01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:45.300
- Sure.
- Constantly.

01:07:45.400 --> 01:07:47.400
I might have kale
in there or something.

01:07:47.500 --> 01:07:49.400
She wiped
some smudge off my cheek

01:07:49.500 --> 01:07:50.700
when I said good-bye to her.

01:07:50.800 --> 01:07:52.200
It was probably annoying her.

01:07:52.300 --> 01:07:53.400
No!

01:07:53.500 --> 01:07:54.800
Yeah. She's like,
"get that shit off your face."

01:07:54.900 --> 01:07:57.000
What about our plan?
What about me?

01:07:57.100 --> 01:07:58.200
Where does that leave me?

01:07:58.300 --> 01:07:59.700
Where does that leave
the fellas?

01:07:59.800 --> 01:08:02.500
That's a very legitimate
question, stumpo.

01:08:02.600 --> 01:08:05.000
Once I marry her
and get half her money,

01:08:05.100 --> 01:08:08.200
it's gonna leave you with
a million fucking dollars

01:08:08.300 --> 01:08:09.900
for each of you!

01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:12.300
And after I move in,

01:08:12.400 --> 01:08:14.100
we invite everybody
on the island

01:08:14.200 --> 01:08:16.600
to come watch us
blow up the house.

01:08:16.700 --> 01:08:18.500
- We blow up the house?
- We blow up the house!

01:08:19.500 --> 01:08:22.100
And it's all legal.
I own it.

01:08:24.300 --> 01:08:26.800
How's my plan now?

01:08:28.200 --> 01:08:30.000
You're so brave.

01:08:31.899 --> 01:08:34.200
I'm just hope
the house is ready in time

01:08:34.300 --> 01:08:36.200
for the first busload of kids

01:08:36.300 --> 01:08:39.800
that are going through.

01:08:42.200 --> 01:08:44.600
- This is for them.
- Yeah.

01:08:44.700 --> 01:08:47.399
They should have
a beautiful place to come

01:08:47.500 --> 01:08:52.600
with their family to fight off
this... terrible disease.

01:08:52.700 --> 01:08:54.500
I love you so much.

01:08:54.600 --> 01:08:56.500
I love you.

01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:18.600
Good morning.

01:09:21.600 --> 01:09:24.300
- Rolly.
- Hey, Rhonda!

01:09:24.399 --> 01:09:26.800
Good morning, ray.

01:09:26.899 --> 01:09:29.200
- How you doing?
- Good morning.

01:09:30.800 --> 01:09:32.300
Got a little surprise for you.

01:09:32.399 --> 01:09:35.300
They call it vanilla latte.

01:09:35.399 --> 01:09:36.600
Aw, you're the best.

01:09:36.700 --> 01:09:39.600
I observed you the other day,
I saw what you ordered.

01:09:39.700 --> 01:09:41.200
I took a little note, you know.

01:09:41.300 --> 01:09:42.500
And you in the seersucker.

01:09:42.600 --> 01:09:44.500
- Mm? What do you think?
- Wow.

01:09:44.600 --> 01:09:46.399
I mean, it takes a lot
to pull that off.

01:09:46.500 --> 01:09:48.700
What? Are you kidding?
I was raised on seersucker.

01:09:48.800 --> 01:09:50.100
Got bar mitzvahed
in seersucker.

01:09:50.200 --> 01:09:51.600
I got a closet full of these.

01:09:51.700 --> 01:09:53.000
- Well...
- It's all I wear.

01:09:53.100 --> 01:09:55.800
- You wanna come inside?
- Love to.

01:09:56.600 --> 01:09:58.100
- Hey, asshole.
- What?

01:09:58.200 --> 01:09:59.600
What the hell
are you looking at?

01:09:59.700 --> 01:10:00.800
- Get the fuck over here.
- Yes, sir.

01:10:00.900 --> 01:10:03.400
Throw those bags in...
God damn it!

01:10:03.500 --> 01:10:06.800
You know what? That lid, that
sippy lid with the hole in it.

01:10:06.900 --> 01:10:08.100
- Yeah?
- I invented that.

01:10:08.200 --> 01:10:09.800
Really? You know
what else you invented?

01:10:09.900 --> 01:10:11.900
- What?
- Ah.

01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:15.200
- Oh, my God.
- They look so great. I really love them.

01:10:15.300 --> 01:10:17.600
I hope it really catches on.
I gotta tell you something.

01:10:17.700 --> 01:10:19.400
Because I would love to be
remembered

01:10:19.500 --> 01:10:22.100
as the guy who invented
the eye-level outlet.

01:10:22.200 --> 01:10:23.400
What a legacy that would be.

01:10:23.500 --> 01:10:24.900
Yeah. It would be amazing.

01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:27.100
And then you could get into
designing the plates...

01:10:27.200 --> 01:10:28.200
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:10:28.300 --> 01:10:29.600
You have coffee.
You need coffee?

01:10:29.600 --> 01:10:30.700
Oh, no thanks.

01:10:30.800 --> 01:10:32.400
Yeah. Rolly got me
a vanilla latte.

01:10:32.500 --> 01:10:33.700
She likes lattes.

01:10:33.900 --> 01:10:35.200
Look at the jacket.

01:10:35.300 --> 01:10:37.800
- Yeah, it's seersucker.
- Yeah. Sharp.

01:10:37.900 --> 01:10:39.300
I never could get my head
around seersucker.

01:10:39.400 --> 01:10:41.800
Really?
It's a nice look.

01:10:41.900 --> 01:10:44.200
Hey, guys.
Look at the skiers.

01:10:44.400 --> 01:10:45.800
Oh, wow.
Look at that. What a day.

01:10:45.900 --> 01:10:49.000
Let's go water-skiing.
We gotta take out the new boat.

01:10:49.100 --> 01:10:51.100
I know, but I cannot
do it. It's a...

01:10:51.200 --> 01:10:52.700
Hey, you know what?

01:10:52.800 --> 01:10:54.600
I'm happy to take
you water-skiing.

01:10:54.700 --> 01:10:55.800
You want me to...?

01:10:55.900 --> 01:10:57.300
My friend Frank
can drive the boat.

01:10:57.400 --> 01:10:58.700
Take it out.
It's there to be enjoyed.

01:10:58.800 --> 01:11:00.000
- I love it.
- Sure.

01:11:00.100 --> 01:11:01.700
- You should enjoy it.
- Yeah.

01:11:01.700 --> 01:11:04.200
- Those guys are good.
- She wants to go. That's fine.

01:11:04.300 --> 01:11:06.300
- I'd love it. Let's do it.
- No, it looks great.

01:11:06.400 --> 01:11:07.800
- Dad. What's going on?
- Hey, there he is.

01:11:07.900 --> 01:11:08.900
How are you?

01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:10.400
- Howard, this is rolly.
- Rolly.

01:11:10.500 --> 01:11:12.600
He's helping us out around
the house a little bit.

01:11:12.700 --> 01:11:14.300
- Hello, Howard.
- Run upstairs, grab a shower,

01:11:14.400 --> 01:11:16.000
- we'll go get something to eat.
- All right. Sounds good.

01:11:16.100 --> 01:11:17.700
- Ok. See you, bud.
- All right. Hey, rolly.

01:11:17.800 --> 01:11:19.900
- Yeah?
- It's good to meet you.

01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:22.100
Yeah. Nice to meet you, Howard.

01:11:23.400 --> 01:11:25.600
- See you, bud.
- See you.

01:11:25.700 --> 01:11:28.800
Oh, my God.
What a kid.

01:11:28.900 --> 01:11:30.800
Man, oh, man.
What charisma.

01:11:30.900 --> 01:11:32.800
He lights up a room, this kid.

01:11:32.900 --> 01:11:34.100
- He does.
- He lights it up.

01:11:34.200 --> 01:11:36.000
- Can I say something crazy?
- Yeah.

01:11:36.100 --> 01:11:37.300
I think this kid
could be president.

01:11:37.400 --> 01:11:39.800
I'm not kidding.
He's got that aura.

01:11:39.900 --> 01:11:41.300
Or at least a senator.

01:11:41.400 --> 01:11:44.100
- The girls are all over him.
- A councilman, a city council.

01:11:44.300 --> 01:11:46.300
- A councilman?
- That kid could be in the city council.

01:11:46.400 --> 01:11:47.700
You're very sweet,
thank you so much.

01:11:47.800 --> 01:11:49.400
At the very least a dentist.

01:11:50.800 --> 01:11:52.900
I fucking doubted you,
but you were right.

01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:54.400
She fucking loves you.

01:11:54.500 --> 01:11:56.400
- Did I tell you?
- You told me.

01:11:56.500 --> 01:11:57.900
- Was I right?
- You were right.

01:11:58.000 --> 01:11:59.600
- Am I crazy?
- You're not crazy.

01:11:59.700 --> 01:12:01.800
And how dumb is
the fucking husband?

01:12:01.900 --> 01:12:03.200
Oh, my God.
Moron!

01:12:03.300 --> 01:12:04.700
He let you take
her water-skiing?

01:12:04.800 --> 01:12:07.000
- Water-skiing, take her!
- Unbelievable.

01:12:07.100 --> 01:12:08.500
I wonder where we should live?

01:12:08.600 --> 01:12:10.500
I know I made fun
of the bowling alley.

01:12:10.600 --> 01:12:13.500
To tell you the truth, between
you and me, I love to bowl.

01:12:13.600 --> 01:12:15.000
Oh.

01:12:15.100 --> 01:12:17.100
- We'll get a league going.
- Let's start a league.

01:12:17.200 --> 01:12:19.700
- We'll start a league in the house.
- We'll bowl in the house.

01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:24.100
I wonder if she'll let me
date other people.

01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:28.200
Hey.

01:12:28.300 --> 01:12:30.700
Oh, my God.
You were incredible.

01:12:30.800 --> 01:12:32.600
- That was pretty impressive.
- Oh, thanks.

01:12:32.700 --> 01:12:34.300
- That was awesome.
- Oh, boy.

01:12:34.400 --> 01:12:36.300
- Congratulations.
- Whoo-hoo.

01:12:36.400 --> 01:12:38.100
- That felt so good.
- Here you go.

01:12:38.200 --> 01:12:40.200
All right. I've been
hogging all the time.

01:12:40.300 --> 01:12:43.000
It's your turn, rolly.
You wanted to get out there.

01:12:43.100 --> 01:12:46.300
- Yeah. I know, but...
- Here's the wetsuit.

01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:50.500
I've checked every
database available to me.

01:12:50.600 --> 01:12:51.800
I've checked with my friends

01:12:51.900 --> 01:12:53.500
around the country
in law enforcement.

01:12:53.600 --> 01:12:56.700
I even checked morgues
and hospitals.

01:12:56.800 --> 01:12:58.200
This guy, Nathan flomm,

01:12:58.300 --> 01:13:00.400
it's like he's fallen
off the face of the earth.

01:13:00.500 --> 01:13:03.000
I need to find this man

01:13:03.100 --> 01:13:06.300
and repay him what I owe him.

01:13:06.400 --> 01:13:07.800
He's gotta be
out there somewhere.

01:13:07.900 --> 01:13:09.500
- Stop!
- I don't understand.

01:13:09.600 --> 01:13:12.700
Stop the boat. Stop!

01:13:12.800 --> 01:13:14.900
I've been looking
for him for ten years.

01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:17.000
- What are you doing?
- I need to right this wrong.

01:13:17.100 --> 01:13:19.000
Hurry!

01:13:19.100 --> 01:13:20.800
We must find him.

01:13:20.900 --> 01:13:23.400
- I'm drowning!
- We must.

01:13:23.500 --> 01:13:27.400
Throw the fucking thing!
Throw it!

01:13:33.900 --> 01:13:35.700
I told you I would find you.

01:13:35.800 --> 01:13:39.400
Well, what a pleasant surprise.

01:13:39.500 --> 01:13:42.400
Look at this, it's tibor.

01:13:42.500 --> 01:13:45.100
Where is the money for the car?

01:13:45.200 --> 01:13:47.100
I don't quite have it
on me, but I'm...

01:13:47.200 --> 01:13:49.500
- You don't have it on you, eh?
- I will definitely...

01:13:49.600 --> 01:13:51.000
I will tell you
something now, ok?

01:13:51.100 --> 01:13:52.800
If you don't
give me this money...

01:13:52.900 --> 01:13:54.200
Yeah.

01:13:54.300 --> 01:13:55.900
I will have to take
something from you.

01:13:55.900 --> 01:13:57.800
- Yeah. Mm-hmm.
- Ok?

01:13:57.900 --> 01:14:01.800
I will take something
from you very, very important.

01:14:01.900 --> 01:14:05.300
You will take something
important, ok.

01:14:05.400 --> 01:14:08.700
Perhaps I will take a ball.

01:14:08.800 --> 01:14:11.800
Ok. You'll take a ball.

01:14:11.900 --> 01:14:13.000
Yes, a ball.

01:14:13.100 --> 01:14:15.000
I see. Very nice of you
not to take two.

01:14:15.100 --> 01:14:16.600
You could be taking two.

01:14:16.700 --> 01:14:19.300
This is a testament
to your character, tibor.

01:14:19.400 --> 01:14:22.200
You could be taking two balls,
you're only taking one.

01:14:22.300 --> 01:14:23.600
I think that's very nice.

01:14:23.700 --> 01:14:26.500
I want for you now
to stop all talking.

01:14:26.600 --> 01:14:29.600
- Ok.
- And to give me the fucking money, ok?

01:14:29.700 --> 01:14:32.100
I promise you, I'll be giving
you that money within two days.

01:14:32.200 --> 01:14:35.500
That's a scout's honor promise.

01:14:39.500 --> 01:14:41.100
Sorry.

01:14:41.200 --> 01:14:42.700
Oh, no.

01:14:42.800 --> 01:14:44.100
Hey, tibor.

01:14:44.200 --> 01:14:46.800
Can I talk to you
for one second?

01:14:48.200 --> 01:14:50.200
Hey, uh...

01:14:50.300 --> 01:14:52.900
You and Jennifer, huh?

01:14:53.000 --> 01:14:54.600
What is it to you?

01:14:54.700 --> 01:14:57.700
Well, I was just curious.
You're dating?

01:14:57.800 --> 01:14:59.000
She's nice girl.

01:14:59.100 --> 01:15:00.900
Oh, lovely, lovely girl.

01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:02.600
But there's something
I need to tell you.

01:15:02.700 --> 01:15:05.000
What do you need to tell me?

01:15:05.200 --> 01:15:07.200
She blew Chicago.

01:15:10.200 --> 01:15:11.600
The city?

01:15:11.700 --> 01:15:13.500
The band.

01:15:13.600 --> 01:15:15.400
"25 or 6 to 4" Chicago?

01:15:15.500 --> 01:15:18.300
- Yes. Yes.
- How do you know this?

01:15:18.400 --> 01:15:20.000
It's common knowledge.

01:15:20.100 --> 01:15:21.800
Everybody on the island
knows this.

01:15:21.900 --> 01:15:23.200
She blew Chicago?

01:15:23.300 --> 01:15:24.500
It's not such a big deal.

01:15:24.600 --> 01:15:28.100
You blow people.
People blow people, it happens.

01:15:28.200 --> 01:15:31.300
Eh... it's not so bad.

01:15:40.200 --> 01:15:42.700
- Good song.
- Awesome song.

01:15:42.800 --> 01:15:45.100
- You like this band?
- I love these guys.

01:15:45.200 --> 01:15:48.000
You love them, huh?
How much do you love them?

01:15:48.100 --> 01:15:50.100
Oh, I have, like,
four of their albums.

01:15:50.200 --> 01:15:52.500
Tell me. You go to concert
here maybe 20 years ago?

01:15:52.600 --> 01:15:56.000
- I had a blast.
- Oh, you had a blast, huh?

01:15:56.100 --> 01:15:57.500
Let me ask you
one more question.

01:15:57.600 --> 01:16:00.200
Did you perhaps go
backstage after show?

01:16:00.300 --> 01:16:01.700
Jennifer!

01:16:03.300 --> 01:16:04.900
Jennifer!

01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:06.700
What the fuck?

01:16:43.100 --> 01:16:45.200
- Hey.
- Hi.

01:16:45.300 --> 01:16:47.200
- Look at this.
- So funny.

01:16:47.300 --> 01:16:49.400
How about that, huh?

01:16:49.500 --> 01:16:51.100
Crazy.

01:16:53.300 --> 01:16:55.000
That's funny.

01:16:58.700 --> 01:17:00.400
All right.

01:17:00.500 --> 01:17:02.600
No, no. You back up

01:17:02.700 --> 01:17:05.200
'cause you've got, your
clearance is much closer.

01:17:05.300 --> 01:17:07.400
Your clearance isn't far back.
It's right around the corner.

01:17:07.500 --> 01:17:09.400
Your clearance is
right around the corner.

01:17:09.500 --> 01:17:12.400
My clearance is a little bit
further than around the corner.

01:17:12.500 --> 01:17:13.700
- Rhonda...
- It just is.

01:17:13.800 --> 01:17:15.600
I know where
the clearances are.

01:17:15.700 --> 01:17:17.700
Rolly, I've been driving
this road every day.

01:17:17.800 --> 01:17:20.100
Rhonda, I've been
here ten years.

01:17:20.200 --> 01:17:22.300
I know every clearance
on the island.

01:17:22.400 --> 01:17:25.300
You need to back up.
Why should I back up?

01:17:25.300 --> 01:17:27.100
You got a little tiny car.

01:17:27.200 --> 01:17:28.600
I'm sorry. I can't even believe
we're having this conversation!

01:17:28.700 --> 01:17:30.000
I don't believe it either!

01:17:30.100 --> 01:17:31.800
Your clearance is
right behind you.

01:17:31.900 --> 01:17:33.300
You want to bet
some money on that?

01:17:33.300 --> 01:17:34.700
Yeah, I wanna bet
a lot of money on that!

01:17:34.800 --> 01:17:36.300
Oh, and you have
the money to put on it!

01:17:36.400 --> 01:17:38.600
- Move your car. Rolly!
- What?

01:17:38.700 --> 01:17:40.800
- Back up your car.
- No, back up your car.

01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:43.400
Oh, my God.
Are you out of your mind?

01:17:43.500 --> 01:17:45.600
- I'm out of my mind? What?
- Are you kidding me?

01:17:45.700 --> 01:17:46.800
It's not that hard!

01:17:49.200 --> 01:17:50.600
Vineyard etiquette dictates

01:17:50.700 --> 01:17:51.900
that the person closest
to the clearance...

01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:53.500
- Vineyard etiquette?
- ...Moves back.

01:17:53.600 --> 01:17:56.200
- No, you back up your car.
- What, you have a Howard,

01:17:56.300 --> 01:17:58.200
you're entitled to do
anything you want, is that it?

01:17:58.300 --> 01:17:59.900
I didn't say
that my Howard entitled me

01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:01.400
to not move backwards.

01:18:01.500 --> 01:18:03.600
- Back up your car.
- No, you back up your car.

01:18:03.700 --> 01:18:06.600
- No, you back up.
- No, you back up.

01:18:17.600 --> 01:18:19.400
Are you crazy?

01:18:19.500 --> 01:18:22.400
Are you out
of your fucking mind?

01:18:22.500 --> 01:18:23.600
No good?

01:18:23.700 --> 01:18:25.900
Crazy old man!

01:18:26.000 --> 01:18:29.900
I love my husband.
"No good," rolly.

01:18:30.000 --> 01:18:32.300
I thought there was a little...

01:18:32.400 --> 01:18:35.700
Yeah. Get in your car
and back the fuck up! Back up!

01:18:35.800 --> 01:18:39.400
The smudge...
You gave me a smudge thing.

01:18:39.500 --> 01:18:41.400
A smudge?

01:18:41.500 --> 01:18:43.900
Yeah. A tooth check.

01:18:44.000 --> 01:18:46.900
- Get in your car!
- I'll get in the car.

01:18:47.000 --> 01:18:49.100
- A smudge?
- Sorry.

01:18:49.200 --> 01:18:50.800
What are you,
in fucking middle school?

01:18:50.900 --> 01:18:52.900
A misunderstanding.

01:18:58.500 --> 01:19:01.700
I don't know what I was
thinking. I don't know.

01:19:01.700 --> 01:19:03.900
No, you placed too much emphasis
on a tooth check

01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:05.300
I don't know what I was
I can tell you that right now.

01:19:05.400 --> 01:19:07.900
Tooth checks don't mean
what they used to be, you know.

01:19:08.000 --> 01:19:10.200
So what now,
what do we do now?

01:19:10.300 --> 01:19:11.800
Back to plan a.

01:19:11.900 --> 01:19:13.700
This is exactly what we should
have done in the first place.

01:19:13.800 --> 01:19:16.400
Now we're right back,
full circle, it's on.

01:19:16.500 --> 01:19:20.500
Am I right? Come on. Let's go
blow that fucking house up.

01:19:20.600 --> 01:19:22.200
Am I right?

01:19:25.300 --> 01:19:26.700
Ok.

01:19:26.800 --> 01:19:30.400
Good news. Hot dog!
What's the plan?

01:19:30.500 --> 01:19:32.600
Well, next week's
the Chicago concert.

01:19:32.700 --> 01:19:34.800
I know that haneys are going,
nobody's gonna be home.

01:19:34.800 --> 01:19:37.700
All right. The day of the
Chicago concert, that's it.

01:19:37.800 --> 01:19:40.700
This is great. This is great.

01:19:40.800 --> 01:19:41.900
Do me a favor, will you?

01:19:42.000 --> 01:19:43.400
Sure.

01:19:43.500 --> 01:19:45.400
There's a painting
of mine in that house.

01:19:45.500 --> 01:19:46.700
- Ok.
- It's a plepler.

01:19:46.800 --> 01:19:49.700
He stole it from me.

01:19:49.800 --> 01:19:51.600
It's a painting
of a shopping cart.

01:19:51.700 --> 01:19:53.900
- It's a painting of a shopping cart...
- Shopping cart.

01:19:53.900 --> 01:19:56.500
Is a plepler is a type of shopping
cart or is that who painted it?

01:19:56.500 --> 01:19:57.800
What does
it matter to you?

01:19:57.900 --> 01:20:00.300
We're in. The day
of the Chicago concert,

01:20:00.400 --> 01:20:02.500
all hands in.

01:20:02.600 --> 01:20:04.200
Hands in.

01:20:04.300 --> 01:20:06.400
I'm not involved,
I'm just a liaison.

01:20:06.500 --> 01:20:09.600
Come on, fellas. Put our
hands in. Go on in there.

01:20:09.700 --> 01:20:11.700
Put your hand in there.
Nice work.

01:20:13.500 --> 01:20:16.200
I'm gonna fix
that bald-headed motherfucker.

01:20:19.000 --> 01:20:22.100
Wait until you hear this bullshit.

01:20:36.500 --> 01:20:38.200
Hey, you better
hold on to these.

01:20:38.400 --> 01:20:39.900
I plan on getting fucked up.

01:20:40.000 --> 01:20:41.600
All right. I'm gonna meet you
in the lobby in a few minutes.

01:20:41.700 --> 01:20:45.100
- I gotta do something.
- Whoo! Fucking Chicago!

01:20:45.200 --> 01:20:47.000
- Do you have a pass?
- No.

01:20:47.100 --> 01:20:49.100
I can't let you in
without a pass, my man.

01:20:49.200 --> 01:20:51.000
I'm gonna level with you, ok?

01:20:51.100 --> 01:20:53.200
- Ok, level with me.
- Here's what happened.

01:20:53.300 --> 01:20:55.500
My ex-girlfriend, who I lived
with for three years,

01:20:55.600 --> 01:20:58.700
I found out now that
it's possible that she had

01:20:58.800 --> 01:21:02.200
some kind of oral activity
with them 20 years ago

01:21:02.300 --> 01:21:03.700
after they played here.

01:21:03.800 --> 01:21:05.800
So it's kind of...
It's bugging me

01:21:05.900 --> 01:21:08.900
and I need... I just want
to find out if it's true.

01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:10.800
I understand
you might wanna know,

01:21:10.900 --> 01:21:13.700
but I just can't let
you back here without a pass.

01:21:13.800 --> 01:21:15.200
Ok. Yeah, you did a good job.

01:21:15.300 --> 01:21:17.300
- You're doing your job.
- That's what it is.

01:21:17.400 --> 01:21:20.200
Where do they want us for this photo shoot?
Excuse me...

01:21:20.300 --> 01:21:22.600
I'm not a nut. I just
have one quick question.

01:21:22.700 --> 01:21:25.000
- I'm sorry. One question.
- Yeah. Sure.

01:21:25.100 --> 01:21:29.000
When you guys were here,
um, 20 years ago,

01:21:29.100 --> 01:21:31.800
do you remember getting blown
by a woman named Wendy?

01:21:31.900 --> 01:21:33.900
What?

01:21:34.000 --> 01:21:36.000
- You're serious?
- Sorry to be so blunt.

01:21:36.100 --> 01:21:37.400
Twenty years ago?

01:21:37.500 --> 01:21:39.100
And this is
what she looked like.

01:21:39.200 --> 01:21:41.500
- That's a long time.
- Yeah. I do remember her.

01:21:41.600 --> 01:21:43.200
- I don't know.
- You do? Really?

01:21:43.300 --> 01:21:44.500
- Yes.
- I don't know.

01:21:44.600 --> 01:21:48.000
Oh, yeah that was me.
Yes. I remember her.

01:21:48.100 --> 01:21:49.400
She was a lot of fun,
wasn't she?

01:21:49.600 --> 01:21:51.200
- Yeah, she was.
- I think that was you.

01:21:51.300 --> 01:21:53.000
- You and you?
- Yeah.

01:21:53.100 --> 01:21:54.900
- Two?
- Definitely. Yeah.

01:21:55.000 --> 01:21:56.200
Wendy.

01:21:56.300 --> 01:21:59.000
Hmm. Ok.

01:21:59.100 --> 01:22:00.300
I was with another chick.

01:22:00.400 --> 01:22:01.800
Roberta stumpo?

01:22:01.900 --> 01:22:03.900
- Yeah.
- Roberta St...

01:22:04.000 --> 01:22:06.700
Thanks for clearing that up.
Appreciate it.

01:22:06.800 --> 01:22:08.300
- Whatever.
- Roberta stumpo...

01:22:08.400 --> 01:22:09.800
Can't believe
how good that show was.

01:22:28.500 --> 01:22:30.900
Hey, that's Nathan flomm!

01:22:31.000 --> 01:22:33.100
That's the guy that
lost a billion dollars.

01:22:33.200 --> 01:22:35.200
That's him.

01:22:35.300 --> 01:22:38.200
Hey, rolly, what's the deal?
Are all these rumors true?

01:22:38.300 --> 01:22:41.900
Are you Nathan flomm?
Just be honest.

01:22:47.600 --> 01:22:51.200
- Everybody knows.
- Yeah. I know. Jaspar.

01:22:52.300 --> 01:22:54.800
- I think I'm gonna go home.
- Go home?

01:22:54.900 --> 01:22:56.300
I can't stay here,
this is horrible.

01:22:56.300 --> 01:22:57.600
No, it's...

01:22:57.700 --> 01:22:59.000
It's embarrassing.
I don't wanna be here.

01:22:59.100 --> 01:23:01.000
Who cares if it's embarrassing?
This is your alibi, remember?

01:23:01.100 --> 01:23:02.500
Right.

01:23:02.600 --> 01:23:04.500
How dare you,
Nathan flomm,

01:23:04.600 --> 01:23:06.800
come to the Chicago concert!

01:23:07.800 --> 01:23:09.200
That's good.

01:23:09.300 --> 01:23:12.400
How dare you! Get the fuck
out of here, Nathan flomm!

01:23:12.500 --> 01:23:14.800
- That's him, flomm.
- Jerk.

01:23:14.900 --> 01:23:16.200
That
billion-dollar guy?

01:23:21.900 --> 01:23:24.000
I would like to speak
with please, um,

01:23:24.100 --> 01:23:28.300
Mr. Robert lamm
or members of Chicago band.

01:23:28.400 --> 01:23:30.000
Do you have a pass?

01:23:30.100 --> 01:23:31.500
I have problem.

01:23:31.600 --> 01:23:35.800
My friend, uh,
they say she has had, um,

01:23:35.900 --> 01:23:39.600
oral intimacies
with the... with the band.

01:23:39.700 --> 01:23:42.600
And I want to know
for me is this true.

01:23:42.700 --> 01:23:44.300
Is her name Wendy?

01:23:44.500 --> 01:23:46.600
- No.
- Roberta?

01:23:46.700 --> 01:23:48.800
No. Her name is Jennifer.

01:23:48.900 --> 01:23:52.200
Jennifer? All right.
I'll be right back.

01:24:01.000 --> 01:24:03.500
You got a tissue?

01:24:03.600 --> 01:24:05.000
Why would I carry
a tissue around?

01:24:05.100 --> 01:24:07.400
Why wouldn't you have a tissue?
It's not inconceivable.

01:24:07.500 --> 01:24:09.000
I would leave my house

01:24:09.100 --> 01:24:10.700
and take tissues
before I leave,

01:24:10.800 --> 01:24:12.000
just put them in my pocket?

01:24:12.200 --> 01:24:13.500
I take tissues sometimes.

01:24:13.600 --> 01:24:15.400
"Rolly," my ass.

01:24:15.500 --> 01:24:17.800
You let me read
about that in the newspaper?

01:24:17.900 --> 01:24:20.900
Big whoop, I blew the lead
singer from Chicago.

01:24:21.000 --> 01:24:23.000
That's not nearly half as bad
as what you did.

01:24:23.100 --> 01:24:25.100
First of all, it wasn't
one guy from Chicago.

01:24:25.200 --> 01:24:27.500
I spoke to them,
I went backstage.

01:24:27.600 --> 01:24:30.200
You blew two Chicago-ans! Two!

01:24:30.300 --> 01:24:32.800
You know what's worse?
Blowing an impostor.

01:24:32.900 --> 01:24:35.000
That's worse.

01:24:36.200 --> 01:24:37.900
Rolly.

01:24:38.000 --> 01:24:40.300
Tibby, what are you doing
at the Chicago concert?

01:24:40.400 --> 01:24:43.100
Hey!

01:24:56.200 --> 01:24:58.800
I can't believe it's you!

01:24:58.900 --> 01:25:01.900
It's really you!
Honey, rolly...

01:25:02.000 --> 01:25:04.300
Rolly is, is, is Nathan.

01:25:04.400 --> 01:25:06.400
You should have seen
this guy ten years ago,

01:25:06.500 --> 01:25:08.200
with the beard and the hair.

01:25:08.300 --> 01:25:10.400
My God. It was...
It was crazy.

01:25:10.500 --> 01:25:12.800
I mean, one of the best
marketing guys in the world.

01:25:12.900 --> 01:25:14.100
What are you doing?
Why didn't you...

01:25:14.200 --> 01:25:16.200
Why didn't you tell me
you were you?

01:25:16.300 --> 01:25:18.400
Things ended
so badly between us,

01:25:18.500 --> 01:25:19.700
and I needed the work...

01:25:19.800 --> 01:25:22.300
The work? You must've seen
the painting, in my house?

01:25:22.400 --> 01:25:24.700
- Yeah, I did.
- The shopping cart.

01:25:24.800 --> 01:25:27.000
Yes. I wondered what
it was doing there.

01:25:27.100 --> 01:25:30.500
I kept it all these years,
three houses, remember?

01:25:30.600 --> 01:25:31.800
Yeah.

01:25:31.900 --> 01:25:34.800
And I kept it to remind me

01:25:34.900 --> 01:25:38.200
that I did not treat you right.

01:25:38.300 --> 01:25:40.000
I've been looking
for you for ten years

01:25:40.100 --> 01:25:44.800
to try to repay you
your share of this company,

01:25:44.900 --> 01:25:46.600
from the beginning,
your original stake,

01:25:46.700 --> 01:25:49.100
your ten percent share.

01:25:49.200 --> 01:25:51.500
I'm prepared to make
that good.

01:25:51.600 --> 01:25:54.300
Are you kidding me?
You're gonna do that for me?

01:25:54.400 --> 01:25:56.900
- You're doing that?
- I need to.

01:25:59.100 --> 01:26:00.400
Your hands shaking?
Did you have a drink today?

01:26:00.500 --> 01:26:02.700
No, I didn't.
I thought I'd try something new.

01:26:02.800 --> 01:26:04.600
Today of all days,
you didn't have a drink?

01:26:04.700 --> 01:26:06.400
Nope, I didn't have a drink.

01:26:06.500 --> 01:26:09.000
I got myself a smoothie.

01:26:18.300 --> 01:26:21.400
- Come on, stumpo!
- <i>Ah, yes. It's Joe stumpo.</i>

01:26:21.500 --> 01:26:24.100
<i>If it's business related,</i>
<i>leave a message.</i>

01:26:24.200 --> 01:26:26.600
Pick up, stumpo!

01:26:26.700 --> 01:26:28.000
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

01:26:28.100 --> 01:26:29.600
<i>please welcome,</i>
<i>to Martha's vineyard,</i>

01:26:29.700 --> 01:26:31.200
<i>- Chicago!</i>

01:26:32.300 --> 01:26:34.000
Rig.

01:26:47.100 --> 01:26:48.600
Pick up!

01:26:48.700 --> 01:26:50.800
Come on, stumpo.

01:26:50.900 --> 01:26:52.100
Stumpo!

01:27:03.300 --> 01:27:07.600
There's a car coming!
A car coming. Stop! Stop!

01:27:07.600 --> 01:27:09.900
Please, please, stop!
Help us, please!

01:27:10.000 --> 01:27:13.500
Oh. Rolly?

01:27:13.600 --> 01:27:15.000
Oh, thank...
It's rolly, Joyce.

01:27:15.100 --> 01:27:16.600
It's all right, Joyce.
It's all right.

01:27:16.600 --> 01:27:18.600
Rolly, thank God!

01:27:18.700 --> 01:27:21.800
We had
a horrible accident.

01:27:21.900 --> 01:27:25.000
You have to take us
to the hospital.

01:27:25.100 --> 01:27:27.200
Rolly, I think I broke my arm.

01:27:27.300 --> 01:27:29.400
Rolly, help me get her
into the car.

01:27:29.500 --> 01:27:32.600
You know what?
It's not a good time.

01:27:32.700 --> 01:27:34.300
- I'm sorry.
- What?

01:27:34.400 --> 01:27:37.200
I absolutely, I have
to get going. I'm sorry.

01:27:37.300 --> 01:27:39.300
You're not gonna help us?
I thought you were nice.

01:27:39.300 --> 01:27:41.400
- I am nice!
- You're gonna leave us here?

01:27:41.500 --> 01:27:42.900
What can I do? I have to go?

01:27:43.000 --> 01:27:45.700
You rude prick!
I sent you a birthday e-mail

01:27:45.800 --> 01:27:47.000
and you never even answered it.

01:27:47.100 --> 01:27:49.000
No. No. I don't respond
to birthday e-mails.

01:27:49.100 --> 01:27:51.000
I never have.
It's just that I get so many.

01:27:51.100 --> 01:27:54.700
You are such an asshole.
You are not nice!

01:27:54.800 --> 01:27:57.400
No. I'm nice. I'm very nice.
I'm a living doll.

01:27:57.500 --> 01:28:00.600
- You're not nice.
- I'm nice. I'm nice.

01:28:00.700 --> 01:28:03.400
- You're a dirty bastard.
- I'm really nice. I'm sorry.

01:28:03.500 --> 01:28:05.700
- You're a fucking asshole.
- I hope your dick falls off!

01:28:05.900 --> 01:28:10.000
You're a motherfucking asshole!

01:28:24.000 --> 01:28:27.000
What's that? Beeping?

01:28:28.700 --> 01:28:30.700
What's beeping?

01:28:32.400 --> 01:28:35.300
No, no, no, no, no!

01:28:38.200 --> 01:28:41.500
Damn it! No!

01:28:41.600 --> 01:28:44.300
<i>Good-bye, Frank.</i>

01:28:44.400 --> 01:28:46.600
Howard! You fuck!

01:28:48.600 --> 01:28:50.300
You piece of shit!

01:28:52.900 --> 01:28:54.600
Fuck!

01:29:20.700 --> 01:29:23.100
Stop it!

01:29:23.200 --> 01:29:24.700
Call it off!

01:29:24.800 --> 01:29:28.400
- I changed my mind!
- Get back! Get back!

01:29:30.400 --> 01:29:32.200
- I changed my mind!
- Get back!

01:29:52.300 --> 01:29:54.700
Yeah! Come on!
We're gonna get out of here.

01:29:54.800 --> 01:29:56.900
Hey, we got you your painting.

01:29:57.000 --> 01:29:59.900
This is a car!
I said a shopping cart!

01:30:00.000 --> 01:30:01.400
- You said car.
- I said cart!

01:30:01.500 --> 01:30:03.000
We gotta go.

01:30:03.100 --> 01:30:06.300
We'll take you in the car!
Come on! Come on!

01:30:10.000 --> 01:30:12.600
Come on!
Where are you going?

01:31:34.900 --> 01:31:38.100
Are you excited? You ready
to get back into things?

01:31:38.200 --> 01:31:39.600
Back into what?

01:31:39.700 --> 01:31:41.500
Future's wide-open now.

01:31:41.600 --> 01:31:42.800
Really?
What am I gonna do?

01:31:42.900 --> 01:31:45.400
I don't know.
Maybe you could, uh,

01:31:45.500 --> 01:31:47.700
become a wizard,
find the hobbits

01:31:47.800 --> 01:31:49.100
and help them destroy the ring.

01:31:49.200 --> 01:31:50.500
You don't like my look?

01:31:50.600 --> 01:31:52.300
If you do decide
to change your name again,

01:31:52.300 --> 01:31:54.700
Gandalf could be
a good way to go.

01:31:54.800 --> 01:31:56.900
How's Wendy doing?

01:31:57.000 --> 01:31:59.000
She's actually
doing pretty good.

01:31:59.100 --> 01:32:01.100
You know, when tibby passed,

01:32:01.200 --> 01:32:03.100
she left her
everything she had.

01:32:03.200 --> 01:32:05.700
And it turns out
the old broad had millions.

01:32:11.100 --> 01:32:12.700
Beautiful out here.

01:32:48.700 --> 01:32:50.100
How you doing?

01:32:50.200 --> 01:32:51.500
Heineken.

01:33:09.500 --> 01:33:12.600
- No.
- Oh, my God.

01:33:12.700 --> 01:33:14.700
Holy Christ.

01:33:14.800 --> 01:33:16.500
Mm-hmm.

01:33:16.600 --> 01:33:18.200
What are you gonna do?

01:33:18.300 --> 01:33:20.800
Yeah. What are you gonna do?

01:33:20.900 --> 01:33:23.300
- The whole scandal. My God.
- Oh, yeah. Yeah.

01:33:23.400 --> 01:33:25.500
Everybody knew about it.
And you went to jail.

01:33:25.600 --> 01:33:27.600
- Oh, my God.
- Jail. Yeah.

01:33:27.700 --> 01:33:30.400
You survived. You look good.
Did you got raped?

01:33:30.500 --> 01:33:32.000
- No. No.
- No. Oh, good.

01:33:32.100 --> 01:33:34.300
- Who's gonna rape me?
- Oh, my God. Good. Thank God.

01:33:34.400 --> 01:33:37.600
- I raped a few people there.
- No. No. No. You're kidding.

01:33:37.700 --> 01:33:39.700
No. Please say you're kidding.

01:33:39.800 --> 01:33:42.200
- Yes. I'm kidding.
- Thank God. Oh, my God.

01:33:42.400 --> 01:33:45.500
But, hey, I'm really
happy to see you. Wow.

01:33:45.600 --> 01:33:47.700
And I'm happy to see you.

01:33:47.800 --> 01:33:50.200
But, uh, it's
a different you, isn't it?

01:33:50.300 --> 01:33:52.400
No. It's the same me.

01:33:52.500 --> 01:33:54.300
You owe me 50 bucks.

01:33:54.400 --> 01:33:56.800
No, no, no, no, no.
I'm so sorry.

01:33:56.900 --> 01:33:58.700
You certainly do.

01:33:58.800 --> 01:34:01.000
- No. I think it was a miscommunication.
- I don't think so.

01:34:01.100 --> 01:34:03.900
- I think it was a miscommunication...
- I know it wasn't.

01:34:04.000 --> 01:34:07.200
But I tell you what,
you can take me out to dinner.

01:34:08.700 --> 01:34:11.600
Like as a way to pay you back?

01:34:11.700 --> 01:34:13.900
Absolutely.

01:34:14.000 --> 01:34:15.800
Like a date?

01:34:18.300 --> 01:34:19.400
Like a date.

01:34:19.500 --> 01:34:21.600
Fantastic. When?

01:34:21.700 --> 01:34:23.000
Tomorrow.

01:34:23.100 --> 01:34:25.100
Tomorrow.
On one condition.

01:34:25.700 --> 01:34:27.100
You take a shave.

01:34:28.200 --> 01:34:30.100
- You got a deal.
- Got a deal?

01:34:30.200 --> 01:34:32.400
For you.

01:34:34.100 --> 01:34:35.600
I can't wait.

01:34:35.700 --> 01:34:37.400
Me either.

01:34:38.800 --> 01:34:41.300
Unbelievable!

01:34:41.400 --> 01:34:43.100
Is your cousin stinky
still working on cars?

01:34:43.200 --> 01:34:44.600
- Nah, he sucks.
- Oh, man.

01:34:46.600 --> 01:34:48.300
All right. Come on,
let's play some cards.

01:34:53.600 --> 01:34:55.300
- Wow!
- All right.

01:34:55.400 --> 01:34:58.700
- This is awesome, man.
- Good to see you, brother.

01:34:58.800 --> 01:35:00.900
- Good to see you.
- Pull up a chair.

01:35:01.000 --> 01:35:04.000
Oh, look.
I got my old spot back.

01:35:04.100 --> 01:35:05.300
You got all cleaned up.

01:35:05.400 --> 01:35:07.600
I was prepping these dudes
for the homeless wizard look.

01:35:07.700 --> 01:35:09.000
Yeah. I got a little
shave and a haircut.

01:35:09.100 --> 01:35:11.000
I didn't want to scare
anybody, you know.

01:35:11.100 --> 01:35:14.400
Hey, what do we call you?
Rolly? Nathan? What...?

01:35:14.500 --> 01:35:15.900
Rolly.

01:35:16.000 --> 01:35:17.700
- Rolly it is.
- Yeah. Rolly.

01:35:17.800 --> 01:35:19.800
- Welcome home.
- Thank you very much.

01:35:19.900 --> 01:35:21.500
So, rolly, am I the first
woman you've seen

01:35:21.600 --> 01:35:22.700
since you've been out?

01:35:22.800 --> 01:35:24.300
Dottie, you're the first.

01:35:24.400 --> 01:35:25.600
You and me, come on,
let's go. Let's do it.

01:35:25.700 --> 01:35:27.800
You're the first, dottie.

01:35:27.900 --> 01:35:30.600
What's the game?

01:35:30.700 --> 01:35:33.000
Five-card draw. I think
that's your favorite, isn't it?

01:35:33.100 --> 01:35:36.000
Same shit-game that he always
plays, nothing's changed.

01:35:37.300 --> 01:35:38.700
Ante up, you guys.

01:35:38.800 --> 01:35:41.800
Well, whether you
know it or not, rolly,

01:35:41.900 --> 01:35:44.800
you have become a bit
of a hero in these parts.

01:35:44.900 --> 01:35:46.300
A lot of people
were happy to see

01:35:46.400 --> 01:35:49.700
that monstrosity of a house
hit the dust.

01:35:49.800 --> 01:35:51.000
- Local hero.
- You're the guy.

01:35:51.100 --> 01:35:52.800
Ballsy move.

01:35:52.900 --> 01:35:55.700
Your three years in prison was
worth getting rid of that house.

01:35:55.800 --> 01:35:58.300
- Absolutely.
- Hey, what happened to money bags?

01:35:58.400 --> 01:36:00.000
They got him on some treatment.
He's in remission.

01:36:00.100 --> 01:36:01.700
- They went back to California.
- No kidding?

01:36:01.800 --> 01:36:03.300
Are they ever coming back
to the island?

01:36:03.400 --> 01:36:04.600
I don't think they should,

01:36:04.800 --> 01:36:07.100
knowing that rolly's
back in town.

01:36:07.200 --> 01:36:08.500
Oh, yeah.
What am I thinking?

01:36:10.300 --> 01:36:11.600
All right, ante in.

01:36:11.700 --> 01:36:14.000
My only regret, rolly,
is that you missed

01:36:14.100 --> 01:36:16.000
the Chicago concert that night.

01:36:16.100 --> 01:36:18.600
My God! Best show
I've ever seen.

01:36:18.700 --> 01:36:20.100
The entire island was there.

01:36:20.200 --> 01:36:21.800
- They were great.
- Yeah. All three encores.

01:36:21.900 --> 01:36:23.900
Everybody had a great time,
especially the band.

01:36:24.000 --> 01:36:25.300
Why is that?

01:36:25.400 --> 01:36:27.100
Jennifer blew them
in the parking lot.

01:36:27.200 --> 01:36:29.600
- I forgot about that.
- Jennifer? The whole band?

01:36:29.700 --> 01:36:32.600
- Lee loughnane, for sure.
- Definitely Jimmy pankow.

01:36:32.700 --> 01:36:35.300
No. No. Not pankow. It was
loughnane and Robert lamm.

01:36:35.400 --> 01:36:36.800
No.
It was all three.
