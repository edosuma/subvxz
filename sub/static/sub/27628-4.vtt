00:06.000 --> 00:08.080
Are you all right, dear?

00:08.080 --> 00:09.519
Just a little nervous.

00:12.480 --> 00:15.720
Now, you're sure you still want to
go through with it?

00:15.720 --> 00:17.160
Yes...

00:17.160 --> 00:18.559
..it's what I want.

00:25.920 --> 00:27.199
Open up, it's the police!

00:28.120 --> 00:31.000
"Were there brought unto him
little children,

00:31.000 --> 00:33.000
"that he should put his hands
on them and pray.

00:33.000 --> 00:35.079
"And the disciples rebuked them.

00:35.079 --> 00:39.079
"But Jesus said, 'Suffer little
children and forbid them not to

00:39.079 --> 00:42.399
" 'come unto me, for of such is the
kingdom of heaven.'

00:42.399 --> 00:44.840
"The Lord has made clear his love
for all of us..." Maude!

00:44.840 --> 00:46.719
Don't worry, they haven't got any
evidence.

00:46.719 --> 00:49.679
On the contrary. I've persuaded a
couple of your victims to confess.

00:49.679 --> 00:51.399
They're not victims.
It's a woman's right

00:51.399 --> 00:52.719
what she does with her own body!

00:52.719 --> 00:55.359
Well, it appears the thought of
eternal damnation is stronger

00:55.359 --> 00:57.280
than your left-wing propaganda.

00:57.280 --> 00:59.200
You mean you've put the fear
of God into them!

00:59.200 --> 01:00.719
She could go down for years!

01:00.719 --> 01:03.200
Back off! Back off!

01:03.200 --> 01:05.120
Or I'll arrest you, as well.

01:05.120 --> 01:06.400
Get off.

01:06.400 --> 01:09.079
You're a dead man! Do you hear me?!

01:09.079 --> 01:10.120

Morning, Father. Mrs M.

01:51.240 --> 01:53.120
Morning, Bunty.

01:53.120 --> 01:55.840
I'll be driving to the finishing
school for the fundraiser later.

01:55.840 --> 01:57.680
Would you like a lift?

01:57.680 --> 01:59.439
Finishing school? Yes!

02:01.159 --> 02:04.840
I have some errands to attend to,
I'll make my own way.

02:04.840 --> 02:07.079
Oh, well, I'll see you
there. Apparently there's going

02:07.079 --> 02:09.680
to be lots of top totty from the
gentlemen's college attending.

02:09.680 --> 02:11.400
Well, isn't that typical?

02:11.400 --> 02:14.159
No wonder you didn't last long
at your finishing school.

02:14.159 --> 02:16.319
Well, those places just teach you to
be a subservient

02:16.319 --> 02:18.719
little debutante anyway.
Isn't that right, Father?

02:18.719 --> 02:20.639
Well, I think you could learn
a thing or two

02:20.639 --> 02:23.520
from those nice, young ladies.
Isn't that so, Father?

02:23.520 --> 02:26.360
Well, from what I hear,
one of "those nice young ladies"

02:26.360 --> 02:28.719
has had a baby to a married man.

02:28.719 --> 02:30.479
A married man?!

02:30.479 --> 02:32.639
The school's handyman Jimbo.

02:32.639 --> 02:34.199
Oh!

02:57.400 --> 03:01.960
Cecelia. That is not how a young
lady conducts herself.

03:01.960 --> 03:06.039
But, Miss Rosewood, you said that to
stand out from other debutantes

03:06.039 --> 03:08.759
we need to have
a competitive spirit.

03:08.759 --> 03:11.919
Yes, but when one is being
competitive

03:11.919 --> 03:14.639
one must do it with decorum.

03:14.639 --> 03:15.719
Always with decorum.

03:17.599 --> 03:19.439
Cecelia, I need to speak to you.

03:21.199 --> 03:22.639
There's a surprise.

03:26.079 --> 03:28.280
I'm very disappointed in you.

03:28.280 --> 03:33.360
You've been reading those
disgusting, ungodly novels again.

03:33.360 --> 03:34.520
I found this in your room.

03:34.520 --> 03:37.560
So you've been rummaging through
my drawers again?

03:37.560 --> 03:39.719
Enough of your wise-cracks,
young lady.

03:39.719 --> 03:41.920
I'm trying to help you be
a better person.

03:41.920 --> 03:44.840
Perhaps I need to be disciplined.

03:44.840 --> 03:49.960
At boarding school, I was forever
being put over someone's knee.

03:49.960 --> 03:51.680
Well, sometimes physical pain

03:51.680 --> 03:54.599
is the only language
sinful behaviour understands.

03:58.400 --> 04:02.960
You do know that Daddy
is a High Court judge?

04:39.079 --> 04:41.560
Never seen you so passionate.

04:41.560 --> 04:43.279
I can't believe they've let you out.

04:43.279 --> 04:45.560
Let me look at you.

04:45.560 --> 04:47.399
Take me home.

04:53.159 --> 04:54.680
Thank you for coming, Father.

04:55.759 --> 04:57.480
This is Mrs McCarthy.

04:57.480 --> 04:58.800
Parish Secretary.

04:59.800 --> 05:02.120
So, how is the little chap?

05:02.120 --> 05:03.600
He's just perfect, Father.

05:03.600 --> 05:04.920
You should see him.

05:04.920 --> 05:07.959
It's a wonder the poor mite
was born at all.

05:07.959 --> 05:09.920
Well, that's all in the past.

05:09.920 --> 05:13.399
I'm sure Nell hasn't asked us here
to be lectured to.

05:14.959 --> 05:16.920
I know you don't approve of
what I tried to do,

05:16.920 --> 05:20.680
but, at the time,
I didn't feel I had a choice.

05:20.680 --> 05:21.720
No matter what,

05:21.720 --> 05:25.199
the taking of a child's life can
never be the answer.

05:27.680 --> 05:31.439
Have you thought about dates
for baptism?

05:31.439 --> 05:34.959
That's not actually the reason
I asked you here, Father.

05:36.920 --> 05:39.720
I've been disowned by my family.

05:39.720 --> 05:42.079
And Rosewood's won't take me back.

05:42.079 --> 05:44.759
So you have nowhere to live?

05:44.759 --> 05:46.000
No.

05:46.000 --> 05:48.439
And if I don't find somewhere before
I'm discharged,

05:48.439 --> 05:50.600
they'll take my baby away.

05:50.600 --> 05:53.079
Well, there is always
the mother and baby home.

05:53.079 --> 05:56.159
No. No, I've heard what happens
in those places.

05:56.159 --> 05:58.680
Children always end up
being adopted.

05:58.680 --> 06:00.920
And would that be such a bad thing?

06:00.920 --> 06:05.000
You need to think about what is
best for your child.

06:05.000 --> 06:07.560
Father, please, help me.

06:13.079 --> 06:14.279
I will talk to the bishop...

06:15.279 --> 06:19.600
..and contact some
charitable institutions.

06:19.600 --> 06:20.720
Thank you.

06:20.720 --> 06:25.040
And what about the father?
Can he not be called on to help?

06:31.879 --> 06:34.279
Exactly ten to a row.

06:34.279 --> 06:37.000
Miss Rosewood, may I have a word
about the girls?

06:37.000 --> 06:40.519
How many more times? They are young
ladies. Indeed.

06:40.519 --> 06:45.279
As their religious instructor,
my concerns have been growing.

06:45.279 --> 06:47.560
Please don't rake up
Nell's pregnancy again.

06:47.560 --> 06:50.279
That "pregnancy"
has recently become a baby!

06:50.279 --> 06:51.959
Fathered by one of our ex-employees.

06:51.959 --> 06:53.600
An isolated incident.

06:53.600 --> 06:57.199
But is it only a matter of time
before it happens again?

06:57.199 --> 06:59.040
Some of our girls... Ladies.

06:59.040 --> 07:01.720
..seem a little obsessed by...

07:01.720 --> 07:02.959
..by...

07:02.959 --> 07:05.439
..sexual matters.

07:05.439 --> 07:07.720
And I think that is partly down to
what is being taught?

07:07.720 --> 07:08.800
How dare you!

07:08.800 --> 07:11.759
For example, that maypole song,
The Lusty Horn.

07:11.759 --> 07:13.680
Sounds rather obscene to me.

07:13.680 --> 07:14.959
Reverend Willard,

07:14.959 --> 07:17.000
are you questioning the
morality of the Bard?

07:17.000 --> 07:18.680
Who the hell is the Bard?

07:18.680 --> 07:21.800
It is a song from As You Like It
by William Shakespeare.

07:21.800 --> 07:24.519
Nevertheless... Now, as an American,
I don't expect you

07:24.519 --> 07:26.360
to know such things.

07:26.360 --> 07:30.279
But what I do expect is for you to
trust in my judgment.

07:30.279 --> 07:32.560
Please don't take that tone.

07:32.560 --> 07:34.079
As business partners,

07:34.079 --> 07:37.720
I hoped we'd have some kind of
special relationship by now.

07:37.720 --> 07:41.159
If you'll excuse me, the guests
will be arriving shortly.

07:41.159 --> 07:43.000
I suggest you pray for some
better weather.

07:43.000 --> 07:46.040
Miss Rosewood! For the welfare of
the students,

07:46.040 --> 07:47.560
can't we at least try to be friends?

07:47.560 --> 07:51.319
Reverend Willard, I am very
grateful to you for your financial

07:51.319 --> 07:52.800
contribution to my school.

07:52.800 --> 07:54.040
Our school.

07:54.040 --> 07:58.000
But if it's friendship you want,
I suggest you buy a dog.

08:27.199 --> 08:30.000
"The lusty horn...

08:30.000 --> 08:33.919
"..it is not a thing
to laugh to scorn."

08:33.919 --> 08:36.960
Filthy, little strumpet.

08:41.919 --> 08:43.279
Forgive me.

08:50.279 --> 08:54.120
Smite the offending hand, Lord.

08:54.120 --> 08:56.639
Smite the offending hand!

09:05.559 --> 09:07.120
Which is true, really.

09:07.120 --> 09:09.080
Absolutely.

09:09.080 --> 09:11.399
Now you're free, I hope it's
going to be a new start.

09:11.399 --> 09:13.000
What do you mean?

09:13.000 --> 09:14.759
Well, you know what I'm talking
about.

09:14.759 --> 09:19.080
Jimbo, I can't just abandon
everything I believe in.

09:19.080 --> 09:21.039
Women in this country are
treated like cattle.

09:21.039 --> 09:23.639
But they'll put you away again.
Then so be it.

09:23.639 --> 09:26.519
So many have their lives ruined by
unwanted pregnancies. Oh.

09:26.519 --> 09:28.639
I'm not going to stop.

09:28.639 --> 09:30.080
Maude. I thought you understood?

09:30.080 --> 09:33.120
I do, but... Then don't ask me to
change.

09:33.120 --> 09:34.159
I'm sorry.

09:40.039 --> 09:42.679
Wait here. What are you doing?

09:42.679 --> 09:44.159
Bluebells. Your favourite.

09:46.440 --> 09:47.720

09:49.120 --> 09:50.159
THUD!

09:51.240 --> 09:52.279

10:19.720 --> 10:21.960
TANNOY: Here at the Rosewood
Finishing School

10:21.960 --> 10:26.200
we focus on teaching social graces

10:26.200 --> 10:27.840
as preparation for entry into
society,

10:27.840 --> 10:33.240

the heart of everything we do.

10:33.240 --> 10:35.039

demonstrate...

10:35.039 --> 10:38.240
Oh, I'm so glad Father Brown can
make it.

10:38.240 --> 10:42.360
I was hoping he would give some
spiritual guidance to my students.

10:42.360 --> 10:45.480
What about the Reverend?

10:45.480 --> 10:50.360
Well, he does his best but he's no
substitute for an English clergyman.

11:03.159 --> 11:04.519
Well, I must say,

11:04.519 --> 11:08.200
your young ladies have done
themselves, and you, proud.

11:08.200 --> 11:10.799
That was a wonderful demonstration.

11:10.799 --> 11:11.919
That's most kind of you.

11:11.919 --> 11:14.840
Would you excuse me a moment,
Mrs McCarthy?

11:15.799 --> 11:17.679
You're not seriously impressed?

11:17.679 --> 11:19.000
Why wouldn't I be?

11:19.000 --> 11:21.679
All that posing and prancing,
it's so demeaning!

11:21.679 --> 11:23.480
They're like pampered pooches.

11:23.480 --> 11:26.279
Binty! Bunty.

11:26.279 --> 11:29.440
How divine to see you!
After so long.

11:29.440 --> 11:32.320
We went to the same boarding school
together for a term.

11:32.320 --> 11:34.919
Before you were expelled, no doubt.

11:34.919 --> 11:36.360
Yes, thanks to you!

11:36.360 --> 11:40.279
Oh, you're not still sore about
that? It was just high jinks.

11:40.279 --> 11:43.480
Oh, like when you put
a spider down my dress.

11:43.480 --> 11:47.960
I'm sorry, I was a little wild
back then.

11:47.960 --> 11:50.039
Would you like a drink? Stiff one.

11:50.039 --> 11:52.080
Oh, there's no alcohol, I'm afraid.

11:52.080 --> 11:55.200
Oh, I'm terribly sorry.

11:55.200 --> 11:56.320
You did that on purpose!

11:56.320 --> 11:59.039
Now, why would I do that?
Because you're a spoilt little brat.

11:59.039 --> 12:02.080
Oh, Penelope.

12:02.080 --> 12:03.480
You wouldn't dare.

12:03.480 --> 12:05.080
Oh, wouldn't I?

12:05.080 --> 12:06.360
Oh!

12:19.440 --> 12:21.559
There was nothing you could do.

12:23.919 --> 12:26.000
We've got all we need from you,
Padre,

12:26.000 --> 12:28.120
so don't overstay your welcome.

12:31.679 --> 12:33.320
So you were in the woods?

12:36.519 --> 12:40.159
Yeah, I was getting flowers
for Maude.

12:42.799 --> 12:44.840
Do you think it's an accident?

12:46.000 --> 12:47.240
More than likely.

12:50.759 --> 12:54.000
Just spoken to the owner
of the van, sir, a Mrs Kempton.

12:54.000 --> 12:56.519
She owns the farm shop at the top of
the hill.

12:56.519 --> 12:59.480
Forgot to put the handbrake on,
did she? Apparently not.

12:59.480 --> 13:02.240
She insists she checked
and she left it in gear.

13:02.240 --> 13:04.279
So it wasn't an accidental death?

13:04.279 --> 13:06.639
And neither will yours be
if you don't sling your cassock!

13:06.639 --> 13:08.840
And until we know all the facts,

13:08.840 --> 13:11.679
don't go blabbing to anyone
about what's happened.

Penelope just did.

13:35.120 --> 13:36.879
I was provoked!

13:36.879 --> 13:39.000
I've just seen Maude Riley die.

13:40.440 --> 13:42.039
Suspected murder.

13:42.039 --> 13:45.320
Murder! But who on earth would
do such a thing?

13:45.320 --> 13:47.120
What time did you get here?

13:47.120 --> 13:49.080
Around quarter past 11.

13:49.080 --> 13:50.799
Who was here when you arrived?

13:50.799 --> 13:52.360
Father Brown.

13:52.360 --> 13:54.399
Say nothing about Maude yet.

13:54.399 --> 13:56.840
I'm so glad you could make it.

13:56.840 --> 13:58.559
Well, I'm sorry I missed the start

13:58.559 --> 14:01.480
but I've been visiting
an ex-student of yours.

14:01.480 --> 14:02.720
Nell Winford.

14:02.720 --> 14:04.120
Yes.

14:04.120 --> 14:06.240
A most unfortunate business.

14:06.240 --> 14:08.279
I wish I could do more to help.

14:08.279 --> 14:11.679
Well, she's about to be
made homeless.

14:11.679 --> 14:15.720
I don't suppose you would
consider taking her back?

14:15.720 --> 14:20.360
With a baby? Father, it would
destroy the school's reputation.

14:20.360 --> 14:24.279
I am, after all, preparing young
ladies to become debutantes

14:24.279 --> 14:26.320
to be presented at court.

14:26.320 --> 14:27.559
So outdated.

14:28.840 --> 14:32.000
Well, perhaps she could stay with
you for a few days?

14:32.000 --> 14:34.799
Oh, no chance! My parents are coming
to stay and I'm on final warning.

15:31.399 --> 15:34.200
Surely you don't think Maude's
killer is someone from here?

15:34.200 --> 15:36.399
Well, since she used to be the
school nurse,

15:36.399 --> 15:38.000
I need to speak to certain people.

15:38.000 --> 15:39.279
Starting with you.

15:39.279 --> 15:42.480
Well, it was no secret
that I couldn't stand the woman.

15:42.480 --> 15:45.279
Maude was immoral. Evil.

15:45.279 --> 15:47.360
Misguided, yes, but not evil.

15:47.360 --> 15:48.720
I rather liked her.

15:48.720 --> 15:50.840
How did you get here so quickly?

15:52.399 --> 15:54.200
Short cut through the woods.

15:54.200 --> 15:55.840
Well, stay out of my way.

15:55.840 --> 15:59.080
We'll continue this inside,
Reverend.

15:59.080 --> 16:01.440
Sergeant, how long did it take to
drive here

16:01.440 --> 16:03.960
from the scene of the crime?

16:03.960 --> 16:05.600
About 20 minutes.

16:05.600 --> 16:07.360
About the same time
as my short cut.

16:08.360 --> 16:10.840
I witnessed Maude's death at
11 o'clock.

16:10.840 --> 16:12.960
What are you blathering on about,
Padre?

16:12.960 --> 16:18.480
Then Mrs McCarthy saw the Reverend
here when she arrived at 11.15.

16:18.480 --> 16:21.960
And I saw Miss Rosewood and Cecelia
at about the same time.

16:21.960 --> 16:24.480
So the killer can't be one
of them, Sir.

16:25.440 --> 16:28.600
Carry on like that, Sergeant,
and I'll promote you to the DBO.

16:28.600 --> 16:29.799
DBO?

16:29.799 --> 16:32.399
Department for the Bleedin' Obvious!

17:18.519 --> 17:20.720
So you're absolutely sure
when you arrived?

17:20.720 --> 17:22.799
Positive.

17:22.799 --> 17:24.079
Reverend Willard!

17:28.559 --> 17:30.200
You killed my wife.

17:31.440 --> 17:32.720
You.

17:36.240 --> 17:38.039
She meant everything to me.

17:38.039 --> 17:42.200
That's not what I'd heard...
Shut up! Shut your mouth!

17:42.200 --> 17:43.720
You better start praying.

17:43.720 --> 17:45.359
Jimbo, stop.

17:45.359 --> 17:46.880
I'll radio for assistance, Sir.

17:46.880 --> 17:48.880
You stay where you are.

17:48.880 --> 17:51.200
Please, put the rifle down.

17:53.960 --> 17:55.559
I can't, Father.

17:55.559 --> 17:57.960
You pull that trigger, lad,
and you'll end up dangling

17:57.960 --> 17:59.440
from the end of a rope.

17:59.440 --> 18:02.480
Then maybe I should shoot you
as well,

18:02.480 --> 18:04.480
seeing as you helped
put her away, didn't you?

18:04.480 --> 18:07.000
I'd leave it to Father Brown.

18:07.000 --> 18:09.279
Jimbo, listen.

18:09.279 --> 18:10.920
Listen!

18:12.200 --> 18:15.160
The Reverend was here when Maude
was killed.

18:15.160 --> 18:16.640
There are witnesses.

18:17.640 --> 18:18.839
I know he's killed her.

18:18.839 --> 18:21.599
Why? Has to be him. He hated her.

18:21.599 --> 18:23.720
Ever since she rejected
his advances.

18:23.720 --> 18:25.319
That's a damned lie!

18:27.160 --> 18:28.319
But what if you're wrong?

18:31.440 --> 18:32.759
Jimbo...

18:35.359 --> 18:36.960
..I'll do a deal with you.

18:38.039 --> 18:41.519
Put the rifle down, and I'll find
out what happened.

18:44.200 --> 18:45.880
How? I don't know...

18:47.640 --> 18:49.279
..but I'll get to the truth...

18:51.119 --> 18:54.039
..and I will bring Maude's
killer to justice.

18:55.559 --> 18:56.680
You have my word.

19:02.039 --> 19:03.079
I promise.

19:11.319 --> 19:13.440
MRS MCCARTHY SHRIEKS

19:15.079 --> 19:16.519
Mrs McCarthy!

19:21.799 --> 19:23.279
Get after him, Sergeant!

19:37.880 --> 19:39.440
FOOTSTEPS APPROACH

19:56.359 --> 19:59.359
There it is, on the left.
Pull over by the woods.

20:08.960 --> 20:12.039
I can't believe you let
him get away!

20:12.039 --> 20:13.799
There's no sign of him, Sir.

20:13.799 --> 20:16.319
Obviously! But he can't have
got far.

20:17.480 --> 20:18.880
Oi, can I go now?

20:18.880 --> 20:20.720
Yes! Thank you.

20:24.400 --> 20:28.319
Now, will you stop fussing?
I fainted, that's all.

20:28.319 --> 20:30.480
Mrs M, you were hit by a bullet.

20:30.480 --> 20:34.119
Oh, for goodness' sake, it grazed my
shoulder. Nothing more.

20:34.119 --> 20:37.240
Graze or not, Mrs McCarthy,
you are in hospital

20:37.240 --> 20:39.599
being treated for a gunshot wound.

20:40.799 --> 20:42.880
I'm very thankful
you're still with us.

20:44.559 --> 20:46.480
Me too.

20:46.480 --> 20:47.839
Give me my baby!

20:47.839 --> 20:49.559
I want my baby!

20:52.480 --> 20:54.000
You can't take him, he's mine.

20:55.079 --> 20:56.759
Is there something wrong?

20:56.759 --> 20:59.960
They're discharging me tomorrow
morning, so I ran away before

20:59.960 --> 21:01.599
they could take him.

21:01.599 --> 21:04.200
Did you manage to speak
to the Bishop?

21:04.200 --> 21:07.240
He won't let an unmarried mother
stay at the presbytery...

21:07.240 --> 21:09.400
Come along.
..but I will find somewhere

21:09.400 --> 21:11.480
for you and the baby to stay.

21:23.720 --> 21:26.880
Er, please, there is no need
to leave.

21:26.880 --> 21:30.000
We still have a full
afternoon of events.

21:30.000 --> 21:34.319
In a short while, the students from
Trundell's Gentleman's College will

21:34.319 --> 21:36.839
perform a Morris dance,
and of course,

21:36.839 --> 21:38.559
we have plenty of refreshments.

22:00.559 --> 22:04.319
Jimbo! Sorry. I'm sorry, I didn't
mean to scare you. I'm sorry.

22:04.319 --> 22:06.680
What are you doing back here?
The police will find you?

22:06.680 --> 22:09.839
Listen. Listen to me. I never meant
to hurt Mrs McCarthy.

22:09.839 --> 22:11.599
I know.

22:14.839 --> 22:19.359
I'm in the old boathouse. I'm going
to need some food and water.

22:20.480 --> 22:21.799
What makes you think I'll help?

22:23.119 --> 22:24.559
Because you've always liked me...

22:26.720 --> 22:28.200
..or, at least, I thought you have.

22:36.759 --> 22:38.359
You've scratched yourself.

22:42.440 --> 22:43.599
Wait here.

22:44.880 --> 22:46.400
I won't be long.

22:47.680 --> 22:49.319
Thank you.

23:06.079 --> 23:07.720
Mrs McCarthy, while you're here...

23:08.839 --> 23:11.319
..would you mind having
a word with Nell?

23:11.319 --> 23:14.359
What could I possibly have to
say to that girl?

23:14.359 --> 23:16.400
She has the morals of an alley cat.

23:16.400 --> 23:18.920
Well, she knew Maude quite well.

23:18.920 --> 23:21.920
She might have some new information.

23:21.920 --> 23:23.240
I'll see what I can do.

23:23.240 --> 23:24.680
And while we're at it,

23:24.680 --> 23:28.920
we should find out if anyone bore a
grudge against Maude at the school.

23:28.920 --> 23:31.200
You mean apart from the Reverend.

23:32.279 --> 23:33.680
Penelope...

23:35.519 --> 23:38.200
I am not going back to
finishing school.

23:50.519 --> 23:52.359
What?

23:53.519 --> 23:54.839
Father...

23:57.839 --> 24:00.079
..how's Mrs McCarthy?

24:00.079 --> 24:02.440
She's doing very well, thank you.

24:04.240 --> 24:07.759
After what's happened, do you think
I should cancel the rest of the day?

24:07.759 --> 24:09.319
Not at all.

24:09.319 --> 24:13.960
I have always admired your steadfast
comportment, Miss Rosewood.

24:13.960 --> 24:16.680
Well, I suppose my upper lip has
always been

24:16.680 --> 24:19.279
somewhat stiffer than most.

24:20.559 --> 24:21.799
Yes?

24:23.440 --> 24:25.279
Despite what people think,

24:25.279 --> 24:30.559
my intention is not just to teach
etiquette and social graces...

24:30.559 --> 24:34.359
..but to give young ladies a sense
of purpose...

24:34.359 --> 24:35.559
..of pride.

24:36.839 --> 24:40.000
And you feel you've failed
in that respect?

24:41.599 --> 24:45.759
After what happened with Nell,
I don't know any more.

24:47.359 --> 24:52.079
Mrs McCarthy said you'd like me to
be a moral mentor to the students?

24:52.079 --> 24:56.960
Nothing official. Just a little help
from time to time.

24:58.319 --> 24:59.759
I'd be honoured to.

24:59.759 --> 25:01.000
Thank you.

25:03.799 --> 25:06.480
I'm a little worried about Bunty.

25:06.480 --> 25:07.839
I can see why.

25:08.880 --> 25:11.880
I'm trying to persuade her to go
back to finishing school.

25:14.759 --> 25:16.160
I don't suppose you'd...?

25:16.160 --> 25:18.519
Accept her as a student?

25:18.519 --> 25:21.319
Just for the weekend,
to show her what she's missing.

25:22.640 --> 25:25.079
Leave it with me, Father.

25:25.079 --> 25:27.519
Cecelia?

25:27.519 --> 25:28.599
No point struggling.

25:30.880 --> 25:32.960
Thanks for the tip-off.

25:32.960 --> 25:35.400
"The evil finally delivered to
the righteous!"

25:36.640 --> 25:40.480
Inspector, escort this man from
the premises, pronto!

25:40.480 --> 25:42.400
Cecelia...

25:46.880 --> 25:50.519
..would you show Miss Windermere
the dormitories,

25:50.519 --> 25:52.039
she needs a school uniform.

25:58.039 --> 25:59.559
Ladies and gentleman,

25:59.559 --> 26:04.519
our very own Reverend Willard
will now lead the Morris dance.

26:15.640 --> 26:18.279
You can sleep in
Figgy Urquhart's bed.

26:18.279 --> 26:20.319
She's away skiing in the Alps.

26:21.839 --> 26:24.440
Don't try and be nice,
I know it's an act.

26:24.440 --> 26:27.119
Bunty, a woman's been murdered.

26:27.119 --> 26:30.119
So our rivalry seems rather silly
now, don't you think?

26:31.400 --> 26:32.440
Yes.

26:34.079 --> 26:35.799
I'll find you a uniform.

26:59.359 --> 27:02.319
One of England's most
underrated traditions.

27:03.920 --> 27:06.960
Dating back to the 15th century.

27:06.960 --> 27:09.039
Originally, it was performed
at court...

27:27.359 --> 27:29.279
Get the Inspector!

27:34.319 --> 27:35.680
Inspector, it's the Reverend.

27:38.720 --> 27:39.960
Watch him.

27:41.200 --> 27:43.559
Stay back from the body.

27:43.559 --> 27:45.680
And nobody leave the premises.

27:49.359 --> 27:51.599
Ladies and gentlemen... Father?

27:51.599 --> 27:55.079
..if you could all kindly retire
to the house and I will serve you

27:55.079 --> 27:57.079
some refreshments.

28:00.240 --> 28:01.759
The Reverend's jacket?

28:01.759 --> 28:05.119
He hung it here before he did
the Morris dance.

28:08.759 --> 28:11.319
What are you up to, Padre?

28:11.319 --> 28:15.319
Reverend Willard's snuff has
a slight odour of garlic.

28:15.319 --> 28:18.160
Stop tampering with evidence.

28:18.160 --> 28:20.519
I remember the smell
from the trenches.

28:20.519 --> 28:22.440
They used it to get rid of vermin.

28:22.440 --> 28:23.559
Rat poison?

28:23.559 --> 28:26.079
Don't touch anything else.

28:26.079 --> 28:27.599
Any suspects, Inspector?

28:27.599 --> 28:30.319
You don't need suspects when the
killer has already been arrested.

28:30.319 --> 28:31.960
Jimbo?

28:31.960 --> 28:34.680
He'd already threatened
the Reverend twice.

28:34.680 --> 28:36.359
And you think he killed
his wife as well?

28:36.359 --> 28:38.519
Enough with the questions, Padre!

28:38.519 --> 28:40.599
Who do you think you are?
A ruddy quiz master?

28:42.039 --> 28:44.039
Has she got fleas or something?

28:52.680 --> 28:54.559
They're letting me go home
later today.

28:54.559 --> 28:58.160
So I thought I'd pop in and see
how you are doing?

28:58.160 --> 29:00.720
I'm not that much of a fool,
Mrs McCarthy.

29:00.720 --> 29:02.480
Sorry?

29:02.480 --> 29:07.119
It was Father Brown's idea,
wasn't it? To look out for me.

29:07.119 --> 29:09.279
Well... I know what you think
of me.

29:09.279 --> 29:11.039
Please, I'd rather you were honest.

29:13.200 --> 29:14.319
Very well.

29:16.200 --> 29:18.599
I think you have been
rather selfish.

29:18.599 --> 29:22.119
With all the opportunities
in life that you have been given,

29:22.119 --> 29:24.039
to throw them all away like that.

29:24.039 --> 29:26.079
I never meant to.

29:26.079 --> 29:28.559
Whatever were you thinking of?

29:28.559 --> 29:32.000
Well, that's just it. I wasn't.

29:32.000 --> 29:34.519
And what's that supposed to mean?

29:34.519 --> 29:36.039
I...

29:37.720 --> 29:39.440
I didn't even know what was
going on...

29:40.480 --> 29:41.680
..until it was over.

29:45.039 --> 29:46.559
Are you telling me that you...

29:47.559 --> 29:50.480
..that you really were that naive?

29:50.480 --> 29:51.519
I, um...

29:53.079 --> 29:54.400
I was...

29:55.319 --> 30:00.680
..taken advantage of
by an older man from the school.

30:00.680 --> 30:03.759
And a married man.
Jimbo was a married man.

30:05.160 --> 30:06.359
It wasn't him.

30:06.359 --> 30:08.519
But there are no other men
in the school...

30:11.559 --> 30:12.839
..except...

30:14.720 --> 30:16.000
..except...

30:22.599 --> 30:24.799
What on earth are these
uniform's made of?

30:24.799 --> 30:28.599
Judging by her reaction, I'd say
Cecelia's rather fond of Jimbo.

30:28.599 --> 30:30.519
I...I...

30:30.519 --> 30:31.640
I have to take this off!

30:35.240 --> 30:39.559
I can't...can't stand it. Arrgh!

30:39.559 --> 30:44.359
That girl is beyond hope. Father!
I've changed my mind.

30:44.359 --> 30:45.519
Please, take her away.

30:45.519 --> 30:46.759
Miss Windermere!

30:54.119 --> 30:55.599
Not again!

31:10.039 --> 31:12.720
What I don't understand is why
everyone thought Jimbo

31:12.720 --> 31:14.039
was the father?

31:15.240 --> 31:17.440
It was Reverend Willard who started
the rumours...

31:18.480 --> 31:20.240
..so no-one would suspect him.

31:24.559 --> 31:27.200
And you never thought to tell
anyone the truth?

31:28.640 --> 31:32.200
The Reverend can be quite
frightening.

31:32.200 --> 31:35.559
And anyway, he's a man of God.

31:35.559 --> 31:37.240
No-one would believe it.

31:55.440 --> 31:57.519
Will Miss Rosewood die?

31:57.519 --> 31:59.759
Well, she has the same symptoms
as the Reverend,

31:59.759 --> 32:01.640
so I doubt she'll last long.

32:05.640 --> 32:09.039
Ruta graveolens. Common rue plant.

32:13.799 --> 32:15.920
You put this in my uniform.

32:15.920 --> 32:19.119
Miss Windermere, didn't recognise
you with your clothes on.

32:19.119 --> 32:20.359
It's her fault.

32:20.359 --> 32:21.960
Spare me the catfight.

32:21.960 --> 32:27.079
If you'll excuse me, I have
more pressing matters. Goodfellow...

32:27.079 --> 32:28.440
You scheming, little harpy!

32:28.440 --> 32:29.680
Bunty.

32:30.720 --> 32:33.559
Cecelia, where did you find
the plant?

32:33.559 --> 32:35.319
I don't know what you're
talking about.

32:35.319 --> 32:39.720
Liar! Does the Inspector know that
you are fond of Jimbo?

32:39.720 --> 32:42.319
Cos if he did, he might think
that you've been helping him.

32:42.319 --> 32:45.559
Ah, I'll go and tell
the Inspector, shall I?

32:45.559 --> 32:47.359
It grows by the lake.

32:47.359 --> 32:48.759
Thank you.

32:49.880 --> 32:51.839
This isn't over.

33:15.640 --> 33:16.680
Mind your legs.

33:18.559 --> 33:21.000
Ruta graveolens.

33:22.920 --> 33:25.279
Nice boat.

33:25.279 --> 33:26.400
Yes.

33:31.200 --> 33:32.519
I know that look.

33:33.640 --> 33:37.400
I still don't understand why
the rue plant is important?

33:37.400 --> 33:40.000
Do you think it might have been used
to poison Miss Rosewood?

33:40.000 --> 33:42.599
No, it's merely a skin irritant.

33:42.599 --> 33:45.440
She was probably poisoned
by the same substance that killed

33:45.440 --> 33:47.559
Reverend Willard.

33:47.559 --> 33:50.640
Oh, Father. They're letting me go
home, at last.

33:50.640 --> 33:53.839
Excellent. Now, there's something
I have to tell you about...

33:55.039 --> 33:57.319
..about Nell.

33:57.319 --> 34:02.720
It seems it wasn't Jimbo that got
her pregnant, it was the Reverend.

34:02.720 --> 34:04.039
Really?

34:04.039 --> 34:06.359
I know, she must really hate him,
but...

34:06.359 --> 34:09.000
You don't think that she killed him?

34:09.000 --> 34:12.599
I wonder if you'd both
wait here for me, for a moment.

34:12.599 --> 34:13.679
I won't be long.

34:26.480 --> 34:27.960
Father Brown.

34:28.880 --> 34:29.960
Miss Rosewood.

34:31.440 --> 34:34.320
They have diluted the
poison in your system...

34:34.320 --> 34:36.199
Yes.

34:36.199 --> 34:39.840
..but somehow a small amount
got into your bloodstream.

34:42.159 --> 34:43.719
May I? Please.

34:51.679 --> 34:53.719
The itchy rash on your legs...

34:55.079 --> 34:56.639
What of it?

34:56.639 --> 34:59.000
Bunty had the same rash.

34:59.000 --> 35:00.880
Rue leaves.

35:00.880 --> 35:01.960
Really?

35:04.320 --> 35:06.599
You must have broken the skin...

35:06.599 --> 35:07.639
..scratching.

35:09.320 --> 35:13.800
But you had a small residue
of rat poison on your fingers...

35:14.880 --> 35:17.800
..from filling Reverend Willard's
snuff box.

35:17.800 --> 35:19.039
How dare you!

35:20.639 --> 35:21.880
You killed him.

35:22.880 --> 35:24.079
And Maude.

35:24.079 --> 35:26.440
Father, this is absurd.

35:26.440 --> 35:29.960
You yourself said that Maude was
killed at 11 o'clock.

35:29.960 --> 35:35.119
Yet, Bunty and Mrs McCarthy saw me
at the school at a quarter past.

35:35.119 --> 35:36.559
That's true.

35:36.559 --> 35:38.360
I could not have driven back
so soon.

35:38.360 --> 35:40.039
No, but you could have rowed.

35:41.280 --> 35:43.480
The distance across the lake
is much shorter...

35:44.920 --> 35:47.519
..and I saw the rowing boat
you used...

35:49.079 --> 35:51.719
..by a patch of rue leaves.

35:55.320 --> 35:57.199
Why did you hate her so much?

35:59.519 --> 36:02.079
You didn't hear what she said,
Father!

36:03.639 --> 36:05.480
It was pure evil.

36:07.480 --> 36:10.039
I was on my way to the farm shop.

36:10.039 --> 36:11.280
And there she was.

36:12.199 --> 36:13.280
Free!

36:14.559 --> 36:16.920
I couldn't believe my ears.

36:17.960 --> 36:20.719
"So many have their lives ruined by
unwanted pregnancies.

36:20.719 --> 36:22.599
"I'm not going to stop," she said.

36:22.599 --> 36:25.199
No. I had no choice.

36:27.400 --> 36:31.400
I released the handbrake,
knocked it out of gear...

36:31.400 --> 36:33.519
..and left it in God's hands.

36:33.519 --> 36:35.079
Maude!

36:36.119 --> 36:37.400
THUD!

36:38.840 --> 36:41.119
Those poor, little children.

36:42.280 --> 36:44.280
How many more would have died?

36:45.840 --> 36:48.199
Murdering innocents
like they meant nothing.

36:50.239 --> 36:52.239
I had to stop her.

36:52.239 --> 36:53.880
But you are a Christian.

36:55.320 --> 36:58.159
You must have known what
you did was wrong?

36:59.760 --> 37:04.440
It was God's will. Working through
me to save the souls of the unborn.

37:05.519 --> 37:07.639
Do you really believe that?

37:07.639 --> 37:11.559
Father, is it wrong to take a life
if it saves many more?

37:11.559 --> 37:13.480
You yourself went to war.

37:14.960 --> 37:16.159
I did...

37:17.760 --> 37:20.159
..but that was different. No.

37:21.719 --> 37:24.639
Like our brave boys fighting
the Nazis...

37:24.639 --> 37:28.000
..and the Christians during
the crusades,

37:28.000 --> 37:30.119
God was on my side.

37:30.119 --> 37:33.000
The God I know would never
sanction murder.

37:33.000 --> 37:37.719
Standing up against evil
isn't murder!

37:37.719 --> 37:40.119
"Fight the good fight."

37:41.639 --> 37:45.440
And the Reverend Willard?
Was he evil too?

37:45.440 --> 37:49.480
He was ungodly and lecherous.
He destroyed Nell's life.

37:51.199 --> 37:52.360
You knew.

37:55.880 --> 37:59.760
I read the letter she sent him
begging for help.

37:59.760 --> 38:01.519
So you poisoned him.

38:01.519 --> 38:06.880
He would have gone on to corrupt
others. Forcing himself on them!

38:07.960 --> 38:11.519
Miss Rosewood... I had to protect
my students.

38:11.519 --> 38:14.239
Jesus understands.

38:14.239 --> 38:18.800
Miss Rosewood, you have become
deeply misguided, deranged.

38:18.800 --> 38:21.760
You must repent, you must confess...

38:21.760 --> 38:23.599
..you must clear your mind.

38:23.599 --> 38:25.920
No.

38:25.920 --> 38:28.239
All I need is God's healing hand.

38:28.239 --> 38:30.480
Miss Rosewood, you are still
very ill.

38:30.480 --> 38:32.920
Miss Rosewood, please come
back to the ward.

38:32.920 --> 38:34.280
Find me a doctor.

38:48.760 --> 38:52.719
Miss Rosewood, you need medical
attention.

38:54.079 --> 38:56.440
God works through me.

38:56.440 --> 38:58.400
He will take away the poison.

39:00.679 --> 39:02.719
Miss Rosewood...

39:02.719 --> 39:04.239
..you are ill...

39:05.280 --> 39:06.800
..and you need to confess.

39:08.400 --> 39:10.000
I am not a sinner.

39:10.000 --> 39:11.119
Miss Rosewood...

39:11.119 --> 39:12.599
And when the time comes,

39:12.599 --> 39:17.719
I will be admitted into
the garden of paradise.

39:33.880 --> 39:35.480
Father Brown.

39:38.079 --> 39:42.119
I always knew Jesus was
an Englishman.

39:43.559 --> 39:46.000
I'm afraid this place is
not for you.

39:47.800 --> 39:49.599
What do you mean?

40:00.239 --> 40:01.760
God has forsaken you.

40:06.280 --> 40:09.119
He has forsaken you.

40:09.119 --> 40:13.400
BOTH: Forsaken you! Forsaken you!

40:19.119 --> 40:21.039
God has forsaken me, Father!

40:22.320 --> 40:24.119
I'm going to hell.

40:24.119 --> 40:27.280
No, you are not going to hell.

40:27.280 --> 40:29.280
Help me, please!

40:30.760 --> 40:32.519
God is merciful.

40:32.519 --> 40:36.119
He will not turn his back on you
in your hour of need.

40:37.760 --> 40:38.880
He is here...

40:40.199 --> 40:42.159
..by your side.

40:44.079 --> 40:45.239
I'm ready...

40:46.880 --> 40:48.199
..to confess.

41:03.800 --> 41:04.960
Ah!

41:07.679 --> 41:09.400
Arrrgh!

41:10.920 --> 41:12.559
Yes!

41:25.199 --> 41:27.599
Thanks for everything, Father.

41:27.599 --> 41:28.960
I'm glad you've been released.

41:30.639 --> 41:32.719
If you could tell Mrs McCarthy
how sorry I am.

41:32.719 --> 41:33.840
Of course.

41:36.559 --> 41:38.159
I'm sorry for your loss.

41:39.679 --> 41:41.400
Must be hard to bear.

41:46.119 --> 41:47.360
Thanks, Father.

41:56.360 --> 41:59.159
Shall we see how the patient's
getting on?

42:00.639 --> 42:03.039
Just checking how you are, Mrs M?

42:03.039 --> 42:05.519
Oh! Fit as a fiddle.

42:05.519 --> 42:08.559
Father, any news on Miss Rosewood?

42:08.559 --> 42:11.159
She's expected to make
a full recovery.

42:11.159 --> 42:12.920
And she's still under arrest.

42:12.920 --> 42:14.360
And Nell?

42:14.360 --> 42:16.599
A charitable home in Evesham
has agreed to take her,

42:16.599 --> 42:19.119
but there isn't a place
for six weeks.

42:19.119 --> 42:22.440
But if she's homeless until then,
won't she have to give up the baby?

42:26.000 --> 42:27.480
What?

42:27.480 --> 42:29.480
Well, I...

42:29.480 --> 42:30.920
Mrs M, you haven't?

42:30.920 --> 42:32.280
She has.

42:32.280 --> 42:34.360
Well, only until the move.

42:34.360 --> 42:35.960
She had nowhere else to go.

42:35.960 --> 42:37.719
You said you didn't like her.

42:37.719 --> 42:38.880
Hate the sin...

42:38.880 --> 42:40.079
..love the sinner.

42:40.079 --> 42:41.679
You said she was selfish.

42:41.679 --> 42:44.679
No. And that she had the
"morals of an alley cat".

42:44.679 --> 42:46.920
I'm sure I never said any
such thing!

42:46.920 --> 42:49.679
You did. Nell is a delightful girl
and...

42:51.400 --> 42:53.000
..I've always said so.

42:54.519 --> 42:59.079
Oh, you'll have to excuse me,
the baby needs feeding.

43:01.440 --> 43:04.280
Unbelievable! She is just so...

43:04.280 --> 43:06.719
Generous? Kind-hearted to a fault?

43:06.719 --> 43:08.719
Not the words I was thinking of,
Father.
