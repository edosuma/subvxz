Dear fellow Monk-ophiles,

00:16.717 --> 00:19.741
"As you can see,
"I have decided to redesign

00:19.742 --> 00:22.120
the homepage... again!

00:23.431 --> 00:26.414
"As the greatest detective
in the universe would say;

00:27.203 --> 00:29.125
"you'll thank me later.

00:29.481 --> 00:32.272
Love to all, Marci. "

00:43.964 --> 00:45.131
Bye-bye.

00:49.727 --> 00:50.760
That's better.

00:52.341 --> 00:54.091
Oh, Brian! Brian!

00:56.104 --> 00:57.937
Victory is mine!

00:58.528 --> 00:59.528
Oh, man!

01:00.271 --> 01:01.371
Thought I had you.

01:01.399 --> 01:02.449
You almost did.

01:02.584 --> 01:03.584
Debbie?

01:04.516 --> 01:05.516
Debbie, honey.

01:06.733 --> 01:07.750
Brian's here.

01:08.286 --> 01:09.486
We're gonna watch the Giants.

01:10.122 --> 01:11.139
Maybe she went out.

01:11.179 --> 01:12.279
No. Her car's still here.

01:13.160 --> 01:14.160
Debbie?

01:14.612 --> 01:15.612
Oh, my God!

01:16.498 --> 01:17.498
Debbie!

01:17.935 --> 01:18.935
Debbie!

01:19.804 --> 01:21.337
Brian, call 9-1-1!

01:22.859 --> 01:24.026
Oh, baby!

01:33.972 --> 01:35.065
Are you Marci Maven?

01:35.488 --> 01:36.788
Do you own a dog named Otto?

01:36.855 --> 01:38.238
You're damn right she does.

01:38.438 --> 01:40.155
That beast of yours
killed my wife!

01:40.258 --> 01:41.562
I warned you about him!

01:41.563 --> 01:42.645
Mr. Ringel, please.

01:42.832 --> 01:43.996
We'll take care of this.

01:44.283 --> 01:45.499
What's going on?

01:45.762 --> 01:48.266
There was an attack earlier
today across the street.

01:49.187 --> 01:51.754
Oh, today?
No, that wasn't Otto.

01:51.766 --> 01:53.408
We're gonna have
to take him in, ma'am.

01:53.576 --> 01:54.593
Where's the dog?

02:08.303 --> 02:10.752
Yeah, I really don't 
think it was him.

Bachelor Auction? What?

03:18.721 --> 03:20.669
Yeah, people bid for you.
It's fun.

03:20.738 --> 03:23.593
- It's for charity.
- Now this side's crooked.

03:23.760 --> 03:26.409
When you're up for reinstatement,
it'll look good on your record.

03:26.487 --> 03:28.791
Plus, it's for a good cause.
Police widows.

03:28.901 --> 03:30.584
It's always the widows.

03:31.341 --> 03:33.308
Why can't they just move on, you know?

03:35.125 --> 03:37.457
Everybody's doing it.
The captain's doing it.

03:37.458 --> 03:39.367
- Don't you wanna be a team player?
- No.

03:39.438 --> 03:41.282
Don't you want to appear
to be a team player?

03:41.350 --> 03:42.417
Sure.

03:42.582 --> 03:43.716
All right. How about this?

03:44.183 --> 03:45.533
You give me $600.

03:45.703 --> 03:46.969
When somebody bids on you,

03:47.174 --> 03:48.858
I'll bid against them. I'll outbid them.

03:49.814 --> 03:52.074
You'll outbid them?
That's a good plan.

03:53.224 --> 03:54.235
That's a great plan.

03:54.616 --> 03:55.909
How do I get my money back?

03:56.443 --> 03:57.909
No, you don't.
It goes to charity.

03:58.485 --> 03:59.537
Let's keep thinking.

04:14.423 --> 04:16.947
Oh, God!
My God! Natalie!

04:20.012 --> 04:23.130
It's that girl,
that Marci Maven,

04:23.263 --> 04:25.446
my crazy fan.

04:32.900 --> 04:33.900
Oh, hey, Marci.

04:33.990 --> 04:35.323
Oh, Natalie, hello.

04:35.416 --> 04:37.149
I need to speak
with Adrian.

04:37.423 --> 04:40.127
Sorry.
You just missed him he's, um...

04:41.933 --> 04:43.079
he's getting his hair cut.

04:44.537 --> 04:45.554
I know he's here.

04:46.584 --> 04:49.467
Okay, he left at 8:00.
He came back 35 minutes later.

04:49.562 --> 04:51.091
And besides, he only gets his hair cut

04:51.126 --> 04:53.192
every first and third Tuesday
of every month.

04:55.269 --> 04:56.271
He's behind the door.

04:56.516 --> 04:58.047
I can smell his shampoo.

04:58.548 --> 04:59.998
Pantene for dry hair.

05:01.754 --> 05:05.264
Listen, I really need to speak with
him It's important I'm in trouble!

05:05.314 --> 05:06.899
That's what you said last year, Marci.

05:06.958 --> 05:08.649
You said it was a matter
of life or death.

05:08.696 --> 05:10.292
He got in the car,
you locked the door

05:10.316 --> 05:11.991
and tried to drive him
to Corpus Christi.

05:12.018 --> 05:13.054
It was Thanksgiving!

05:13.055 --> 05:14.689
What does that have to do with anything?

05:15.550 --> 05:17.270
Listen it's different this time.

05:17.664 --> 05:19.081
My neighbor got killed!

05:19.418 --> 05:20.467
They're blaming my dog.

05:20.535 --> 05:21.998
Somebody's framing my dog!

05:22.028 --> 05:23.264
Okay, then call the police.

05:23.381 --> 05:26.464
I did they don't believe me.
Okay Marci, Marci sorry, can't help you.

05:29.592 --> 05:32.225
- Is she gone?
- Yeah.

05:37.253 --> 05:39.303

Captain Stottlemeyer

05:48.360 --> 05:52.627
plays guitar and claims to be
quite handy around the house.

05:52.855 --> 05:54.738

- That's a lot of money.

06:25.318 --> 06:26.373

So you had better be worth it.

07:23.111 --> 07:24.111
This is Sam.

07:24.596 --> 07:26.017
He wants to be a policeman.

07:26.782 --> 07:29.529
I thought i could just drop him off
and he could follow you around.

07:30.902 --> 07:33.144
Yeah, sure.
That'd be, uh... that'd be great.

07:33.406 --> 07:34.939
This is gonna be
a lotta fun, huh?

07:36.636 --> 07:40.286
Next on our program

07:57.219 --> 07:58.702
Do I hear $200?

08:06.155 --> 08:10.474
Ladies, this is a world-class detective.

08:12.021 --> 08:14.814
Maybe you have a husband
or a boyfriend

08:14.834 --> 08:16.200
who needs following.

08:18.876 --> 08:21.426

09:03.657 --> 09:04.723
$800 going twice...

09:04.792 --> 09:07.597
Wait, stop! No.
No, no, no. Okay.

Beefcake.

09:29.193 --> 09:30.193
Please.

09:30.382 --> 09:32.365
There was a restraing order.

09:33.185 --> 09:34.201
Sold...

09:35.661 --> 09:38.977
to the very determined,
very mysterious girl

09:38.978 --> 09:41.093
in the green.
Okay.

09:41.322 --> 09:45.972
Nice going all righty next.
Okay.

09:50.494 --> 09:51.494
Hello!

09:51.533 --> 09:53.583
Right on time, of course.

09:55.713 --> 09:57.308
It's okay.
I'm right here.

09:58.108 --> 09:59.740
Come in come in, come in.

09:59.843 --> 10:00.909
No.

10:01.030 --> 10:02.450
You can pick him up
at 6:00.

10:03.221 --> 10:04.846
No, no.
She's with me.

10:04.971 --> 10:06.316
I can't do this alone.

10:07.161 --> 10:08.161
Well, Adrian, I...

10:09.438 --> 10:10.588
I bid on you.

10:10.618 --> 10:11.618
I mean, I...

10:11.964 --> 10:13.981
don't think we need a chaperone.

10:14.242 --> 10:15.318
6:00 would be great.

10:15.628 --> 10:18.965
Yeah, she's with me.
I can't do this alone.

10:21.288 --> 10:23.371
Okay, fine good.
The more the merrier i just...

10:23.469 --> 10:25.215
I hope I made enough cookies.

10:27.557 --> 10:30.676
Oh, I painted this for you two years ago

10:30.742 --> 10:33.469
for your birthday,
but Judge Franklin wouldn't

10:33.486 --> 10:34.922
let me give it to you
because

10:34.923 --> 10:36.238
of the restraining order.

10:36.856 --> 10:39.772
You know,
50 yards away and.. no contact.

10:40.788 --> 10:41.788
Jerk.

10:42.662 --> 10:46.868
Oh, please,make yourselves at home.
Sit down i'm sorry I'm babbling.

10:46.900 --> 10:48.158
I'm nervous, you know?

10:48.218 --> 10:50.927
I've just been imagining this
for so long, you know?

10:51.295 --> 10:52.878
You, Adrian Monk.

10:53.304 --> 10:54.521
You're really here.

10:56.434 --> 10:58.034
Oh! So rude.

10:58.571 --> 10:59.571
Here we go.

11:00.887 --> 11:02.654
Summit Creek Water.

11:02.753 --> 11:04.928
It's his favorite.
I know.

11:05.615 --> 11:07.940
Well, do you know what his
favorite drink was last year?

11:08.106 --> 11:09.106
I do!

11:09.399 --> 11:10.399
Sierra Springs.

11:12.969 --> 11:14.478
Ten ice cubes, of course.

11:15.343 --> 11:16.410
And...

11:19.787 --> 11:21.698
some cookies, fresh from the oven.

11:23.449 --> 11:24.476
They're square.

11:25.363 --> 11:27.388
I knew you would appreciate that.

11:27.816 --> 11:29.459
Yeah, I've been baking all day...

11:29.570 --> 11:32.060
and cleaning!
I wanted everything to be perfect.

11:33.136 --> 11:34.136
Marci...

11:35.329 --> 11:36.738
is this my glass?

11:36.881 --> 11:39.428
Not anymore.
You threw it out, remember?

11:40.619 --> 11:42.187
And yes, this is your rug.

11:42.286 --> 11:43.722
And yes, that's your lamp.

11:43.805 --> 11:45.688
And yes, these are your pants.

11:47.674 --> 11:49.838
Don't worry.
Not crazy, just a fan.

11:51.149 --> 11:52.166
You are amazing.

11:53.272 --> 11:54.635
But you know that, don't you?

11:56.853 --> 11:57.936
His pants?

11:58.946 --> 12:01.637
You know what I love?
I love how you solve cases.

12:01.766 --> 12:05.058
The way you move around
and you look at things.

12:05.176 --> 12:07.987
And you see things no one else sees.

12:08.136 --> 12:12.300
I love that.
I mean, you really are a great artist.

12:13.486 --> 12:17.405
Well, a great artist...
I don't know about that.

12:20.358 --> 12:21.358
Is there a problem?

12:22.437 --> 12:23.437
No, no, no.

12:23.499 --> 12:24.551
He's a great artist.

12:26.181 --> 12:27.615
That's why I went to the auction.

12:27.700 --> 12:30.790
Because I really am in trouble.
I need your help, you know?

12:32.672 --> 12:34.724
So do you wanna talk
about the case now

12:34.792 --> 12:37.156
or should we just relax
for a little while?

12:38.501 --> 12:39.895
What are the choices again?

12:40.064 --> 12:41.647
Relax or talk about the case.

12:41.726 --> 12:44.357
Yeah, relax!
Let's just relax.

12:44.763 --> 12:45.763
Plenty of time.

12:47.206 --> 12:49.573
Five hours and 52 minutes.

12:54.386 --> 12:55.386
Mr. Monk!

12:59.138 --> 13:00.255
Excuse me.

13:05.867 --> 13:06.867
Oh, my God.

13:08.548 --> 13:10.265
Oh, my God.

13:16.301 --> 13:18.606
This is my favorite.
It's from last summer.

13:18.629 --> 13:20.865
See, what I do is I read
the articles about you

13:21.079 --> 13:23.870
and then I make dioramas
of the various cases.

13:24.400 --> 13:26.800
This one is "Mr. Monk
and the Three Pies. "

13:28.768 --> 13:29.768
What?!

13:30.391 --> 13:32.180
When you went to see your brother.

13:32.512 --> 13:33.669
That's what I call it.

13:34.848 --> 13:36.298
Is that... me?

13:40.055 --> 13:42.655
Adrian, should we call the captain?

13:43.275 --> 13:44.458
Not yet, Marci.

13:44.879 --> 13:46.795
We need to gather more evidence.

13:47.238 --> 13:49.405
Natalie, get the car.

13:50.174 --> 13:51.583
On my way, Mr. Monk.

13:51.636 --> 13:52.669
Is that me?

13:54.728 --> 13:55.728
It's a troll doll.

13:58.910 --> 14:00.646
I can't imagine life without you.

14:02.654 --> 14:05.228
Adrian, I've waited so long...

14:08.517 --> 14:10.551
Marci, are you a musician?

14:12.512 --> 14:14.229
You know I am!

14:14.629 --> 14:17.179
I've only sent you all my demos.

14:18.031 --> 14:19.647
I'm working on a song. Here.

14:21.443 --> 14:25.943
There's a man in California
If you're ever in a funk

14:29.898 --> 14:32.281
He may not be F. Murray Abraham

14:32.314 --> 14:34.496
But I think he's a hunk

14:36.564 --> 14:38.747
And his name is

15:01.907 --> 15:05.810
On second thought,
why don't you tell me about the case?

15:09.575 --> 15:11.169
I'm sorry.
Can we start over?

15:11.929 --> 15:13.162
You had a dog.

15:13.576 --> 15:15.661
- His name was Otto.
- Yep, that's right.

15:15.662 --> 15:18.806
- And Otto died last week?
- Monday, yeah.

15:18.852 --> 15:20.649
Well, I buried him Monday night.

15:20.971 --> 15:24.255
So he's in the ground, dead.

15:24.979 --> 15:25.979
Dead, dead dog.

15:26.143 --> 15:28.769
And then three days later, on Thursday,

15:29.452 --> 15:31.609
the woman across the street
was attacked?

15:31.754 --> 15:33.820
By... by a dog.
Yeah, she was mauled.

15:34.810 --> 15:36.064
Isn't that the grossest word?

15:36.160 --> 15:38.182
"Mauled. "Mauled.

15:38.501 --> 15:40.366
I mean, Otto had snapped
at her last year,

15:40.433 --> 15:42.260
but it wasn't a big deal.
But of course,

15:42.342 --> 15:44.343
the cops naturally think that he did it.

15:44.425 --> 15:46.835
So they dug him up
to compare the teeth marks.

15:47.924 --> 15:48.991
And they matched.

15:49.616 --> 15:51.133
Well, that's what they say.

15:52.123 --> 15:53.550
They're gonna return him tomorrow.

15:53.609 --> 15:55.356
I guess I'm gonna have
to bury him again.

15:55.416 --> 15:59.200
So to recap, the dog dies on Monday,

15:59.528 --> 16:01.368
then three days later,
kills your neighbor.

16:02.373 --> 16:03.490
Pretty freaky, huh?

16:04.742 --> 16:07.193
And the dog was definitely dead
when you buried him.

16:07.800 --> 16:09.948
Yeah, the dog was definitely
dead when I buried him.

16:09.949 --> 16:11.210
What do you think, I'm a nut?

16:13.382 --> 16:14.559
What do you think, Adrian?

16:14.594 --> 16:17.311
I stopped thinking an hour
and a half ago. What do you think?

16:17.312 --> 16:18.750
I think we should call the captain.

16:21.221 --> 16:22.438
That's the men's room.

16:23.935 --> 16:25.085
And... Hey.

16:25.487 --> 16:28.504
This... is my desk.

16:29.601 --> 16:30.951
Lieutenant Disher.

16:36.946 --> 16:38.596
Oh, check these out.

16:39.652 --> 16:40.652
Real handcuffs.

16:41.024 --> 16:42.024
Wanna try 'em on?

16:46.762 --> 16:49.130
So... Sam.

16:49.403 --> 16:51.241
How long have you wanted
to be a policeman?

16:51.366 --> 16:52.576
I don't wanna be a cop.

16:53.467 --> 16:54.717
But your mom said you did.

16:54.755 --> 16:56.121
Maybe when I was nine.

16:57.355 --> 16:58.664
How old are you now?

16:59.485 --> 17:00.485
Nine and a half.

17:01.350 --> 17:02.560
Who'd want to be a cop?

17:03.152 --> 17:06.417
You don't make any money
and everybody hates you.

17:15.391 --> 17:17.226
Okay, so,
what do you wanna do?

17:17.426 --> 17:20.510
We got some game and stuff,
I think, for when kids visit.

17:20.924 --> 17:22.674
How about that?
Let's see.

17:24.366 --> 17:25.366
No.

17:26.136 --> 17:27.289
Ah, yeah, here we go.

17:27.469 --> 17:28.486
How about this?

17:28.744 --> 17:30.894
We got crayons.

17:31.689 --> 17:32.689
Coloring book.

17:35.684 --> 17:38.047
- I did that one.
- I used to love this game.

17:38.227 --> 17:39.227
Hm. Timber.

17:39.540 --> 17:40.540
Set it up.

17:42.909 --> 17:45.751
I'm looking at the forensic
report right now, Monk.

17:45.903 --> 17:47.649
Your girlfriend's in a lot of trouble.

17:47.704 --> 17:48.737
Yeah, she's...

17:49.308 --> 17:50.774
she's not my girlfriend.

17:51.581 --> 17:54.428
Look, the bite marks all match 100%.

17:54.538 --> 17:55.749
It's as good as a fingerprint.

17:55.796 --> 17:57.881
She says the dog was already dead.

17:58.804 --> 18:02.070
Debbie Ringel was attacked by a dog.

18:02.105 --> 18:03.352
And it wasn't a ghost dog.

18:03.415 --> 18:05.131
<i>Here is a more likely scenario.</i>

18:05.374 --> 18:07.492
<i>The dog kills the neighbor,
Marci panics.</i>

18:07.525 --> 18:11.642
She has her own dog put down and claims
that he died a couple of days earlier.

18:11.795 --> 18:13.993
I don't know.
I- I don't know.

18:14.117 --> 18:17.125
<i>Animal control warned her
about Cujo at least twice,</i>

18:17.126 --> 18:18.449
which means she's responsible.

18:18.484 --> 18:20.469
She could be indicted for manslaughter.

18:20.525 --> 18:21.780
What she needs is a good lawyer

18:21.860 --> 18:24.000
and you need to get the
hell out of there. Okay?

18:24.364 --> 18:25.420
Bye-bye.

18:25.489 --> 18:26.489
Right.

18:27.148 --> 18:28.148
Natalie.

18:31.153 --> 18:34.536
Not like that.
Push it with your fingertips.

18:35.634 --> 18:38.384
Now pull it
from the other side over here.

18:40.600 --> 18:42.442
- All right.
- That's how you do it.

18:42.485 --> 18:44.185
Having fun?
Yeah.

18:44.660 --> 18:45.683
You know.

18:46.680 --> 18:49.592
If you need me, I will be at
the Four Seasons with Linda.

18:49.924 --> 18:50.924
Do not need me.

18:51.360 --> 18:52.360
She'll kill me.

18:53.021 --> 18:54.671
Okay, that's yours.
Have fun.

18:55.476 --> 18:56.476
Oh, Captain?

18:57.473 --> 18:58.473
Have fun.

19:01.317 --> 19:02.667
Okay, I'm gonna go again.

19:03.890 --> 19:04.935
Push...

19:07.516 --> 19:09.249
They think i killed Otto?!

19:09.331 --> 19:11.899
- Well, that would explain quite a bit.
- Makes a lotta sense.

19:11.900 --> 19:13.324
No, I-I don't do that, okay?

19:13.368 --> 19:14.835
I don't kill things I love.

19:15.793 --> 19:17.059
Well, that's reassuring.

19:17.773 --> 19:19.563
There must be another explanation.

19:19.564 --> 19:20.614
Like what, Marci?

19:20.624 --> 19:23.045
Like, I don't know.
I mean, you do it all the time.

19:23.208 --> 19:25.642
The police have a theory
and they think it's cut and dry.

19:25.679 --> 19:28.543
And then you come in
and you do your thing.

19:28.549 --> 19:30.654
And you get clues and you figure it out.

19:30.733 --> 19:33.198
You know, it's like "Mr. Monk
and the astronaut. "

19:33.288 --> 19:35.516
Or "Mr. Monk goes back to school. "

19:35.537 --> 19:37.272
- Oh, remember that one?
- No!

19:37.409 --> 19:38.841
Where are you getting these names?

19:38.908 --> 19:41.024
According
to the forensic laboratory reports...

19:41.058 --> 19:42.308
Yeah, well, they're wrong.

19:43.150 --> 19:44.753
Okay. They can make mistakes.

19:45.194 --> 19:46.994
Maybe it was, uh, a frame-up.

19:49.265 --> 19:50.370
They framed your dog?

19:51.263 --> 19:53.906
Yeah, maybe theydid
frame my dog, Natalie.

19:53.977 --> 19:55.711
It's not totally unprecedented.

19:55.899 --> 19:58.131
What about "Mr. Monk
and the Panic Room"?

19:58.564 --> 20:00.652
They tried to frame a monkey,
didn't they?

20:00.948 --> 20:02.815
See, things aren't always as they seem.

20:03.368 --> 20:04.368
- That's true.
- Okay.

20:05.178 --> 20:06.178
We made a deal.

20:06.434 --> 20:10.171
Okay I spent $800 for six hours.
I own you.

20:10.172 --> 20:11.540
You have to do what I say.

20:18.034 --> 20:19.101
What if he's home?

20:19.405 --> 20:20.953
There's no car in the driveway.

20:21.277 --> 20:22.427
Worry wart.

20:22.714 --> 20:23.714
Adrian.

20:27.898 --> 20:30.381
- You'll be the lookout.
- I'm not the lookout.

20:31.747 --> 20:33.605
That's where they found her...
in the shed.

20:36.286 --> 20:37.503
He's doing it.

20:37.857 --> 20:39.023
That is so cool.

20:39.076 --> 20:40.229
I've got goose bumps.

20:40.671 --> 20:41.988
I really do. You wanna see?

20:42.030 --> 20:43.697
- No, thank you.
- Bumpy.

20:43.992 --> 20:45.834
You have the best job in the world.

20:45.835 --> 20:47.299
Not today, I don't.

20:47.612 --> 20:48.769
Did you say something?

20:50.004 --> 20:51.737
'Cause it sounded like
you said something.

21:33.212 --> 21:34.212
What?

21:34.721 --> 21:36.721
She was attacked right here.

21:37.212 --> 21:38.566
You can still see
the blood.

21:39.778 --> 21:42.044
But she must've tried
to fight back.

21:42.772 --> 21:43.772
Right?

21:44.334 --> 21:45.393
Look at all these tools.

21:45.406 --> 21:48.639
Why... why didn't she grab
one of these tools?

21:50.077 --> 21:51.877
What are you doing?

21:52.019 --> 21:53.536
- Clue hug!
- No!

21:53.694 --> 21:54.875
- Natalie!
- Marci!

21:55.284 --> 21:56.501
Ooh, right.
Yes, go!

21:56.502 --> 21:59.161
Keep going you're amazing.
You're amazing. Do your thing.

22:12.903 --> 22:13.903
What is that?

22:14.884 --> 22:16.601
It's a flower petal.

22:18.779 --> 22:19.779
Tulip?

22:30.009 --> 22:31.541
There's no tulips in this yard.

22:32.980 --> 22:34.063
That's not a clue.

22:34.118 --> 22:36.101
That's just something I notice.

22:36.189 --> 22:38.060
This is what we call
an observation.

22:38.061 --> 22:39.061
Okay, right.

22:39.557 --> 22:40.674
Can I help you?

22:42.489 --> 22:43.872
Oh, it's you!

22:44.985 --> 22:46.801
Why can't you just leave me alone?

22:46.946 --> 22:50.744
Mr. Ringel,
I'm very sorry for your loss.

22:51.100 --> 22:53.348
I wonder if I could ask you
a couple of questions.

22:53.848 --> 22:56.849
Did you actually see Marci's dog
on that day?

22:57.642 --> 22:58.909
Weknowit was her dog.

22:59.026 --> 23:01.491
He crawled in under the fence.
You can still see the hole.

23:01.569 --> 23:02.583
I talked to the cops.

23:02.584 --> 23:03.952
All the teeth marks match.

23:04.080 --> 23:05.158
And who the hell
are you?

23:05.784 --> 23:08.267
Thisis Adrian Monk, okay?

23:08.562 --> 23:10.979
And he happens to be
a genius.

23:11.006 --> 23:12.637
Marci,
don't... don't...

23:12.886 --> 23:14.208
If you have anything
to hide...

23:14.264 --> 23:16.081
and I have a hunch
that you do...

23:16.175 --> 23:19.125
he's gonna find it he's already found,
like, a million clues tell him.

23:19.170 --> 23:21.453
Okay, Marci,
let's just leave this man alone.

23:23.972 --> 23:25.602
Youdid it!
You killed her.

23:25.733 --> 23:28.107
You are in big trouble,
mister.

23:28.341 --> 23:33.544
Big trouble because Adrian Monk
always gets his man, friend

23:33.645 --> 23:37.975
Sorry about her sorry about everything.
Sorry for your loss.

23:40.232 --> 23:41.232
So sorry.

23:43.411 --> 23:44.811
I- I did manage

23:45.397 --> 23:51.318
To get your tools all this hose is
kind of a mess, though you might wanna..

23:51.319 --> 23:52.319
it's okay.

23:59.549 --> 24:00.549
Natalie!

24:02.923 --> 24:04.590
He said Natalie!

24:12.036 --> 24:14.986
According to the police,
Otto dug this hole,

24:15.483 --> 24:18.679
attacked Mrs. Ringel,
then got out the same way.

24:19.103 --> 24:20.103
So?

24:20.822 --> 24:21.860
Well, where's the dirt?

24:22.384 --> 24:25.191
It's all on the other side.
But that's the wrong side.

24:25.230 --> 24:28.180
When a dog digs a hole,
he pushes the dirt behind him.

24:28.809 --> 24:31.009
And... look!

24:34.052 --> 24:35.552
- Dead...
- Tulip.

24:39.974 --> 24:41.041
It's possible.

24:42.195 --> 24:45.628
There's a chance she's not crazy.

24:45.629 --> 24:49.854
I mean, she's crazy,
but she might not be wrong.

24:53.331 --> 24:55.047
- Clue hug?
- Take it like a man.

24:59.036 --> 25:01.279
Uh, I need a wipe, Natalie.

25:02.868 --> 25:03.868
Hold on!

25:04.398 --> 25:06.087
Right here here.
Oh, no!

25:06.088 --> 25:07.088
Use mine.

25:07.269 --> 25:08.819
They're monogrammed.
They're better.

25:08.866 --> 25:10.074
I- I did it myself.

25:10.329 --> 25:11.617
They're sanitary wipes.

25:11.777 --> 25:13.061
Doesn't that defeat the purpose?

25:15.681 --> 25:17.948
Adrian, she's ruing everything.

25:18.005 --> 25:19.288
I mean, who is she?

25:19.380 --> 25:20.643
I'm his assistant, okay?

25:20.691 --> 25:22.144
I been with him for three years.

25:22.355 --> 25:24.355
Well, I've known him
even longer,okay?

25:24.378 --> 25:25.881
Here's a little
news flash, Marci.

25:25.994 --> 25:27.814
Stalking someone
and knowing someone...

25:27.865 --> 25:28.879
two different things!

25:28.880 --> 25:31.877
Excuse me.
Ladies, let's settle down.

25:31.976 --> 25:34.960
I think we might have
an actual murder on our hands.

25:35.076 --> 25:36.110
Oh, woo-hoo!

25:36.788 --> 25:38.340
Exactly.
Woo-hoo.

25:38.848 --> 25:41.662
Let's just think
for a minute, okay?

25:43.111 --> 25:44.961
Tell me about the dog.

25:44.993 --> 25:46.076
How did he die?

25:46.148 --> 25:48.402
Kidney failure.
He went really quickly.

25:48.519 --> 25:51.796
Before he passed,
did anything unusual happen?

25:53.199 --> 25:54.199
Oh, yes!

25:54.572 --> 25:57.320
About two weeks ago,
he disappeared for a whole day.

25:57.321 --> 25:59.125
I couldn't find him.
I was worried sick.

25:59.126 --> 26:00.624
I was putting up posters
everywhere.

26:00.625 --> 26:02.460
And then around 6:00,
he just showed up.

26:04.119 --> 26:06.263
And you have no idea
where he was?

26:06.494 --> 26:08.805
No.
He was covered in woodchips, though.

26:08.952 --> 26:11.369
Is that important?
It took me an hour to brush it out.

26:11.983 --> 26:13.044
You still have the brush?

26:13.045 --> 26:15.972
The brush?
Please.

26:16.286 --> 26:18.016
Actually,
that's a good idea.

26:18.222 --> 26:19.222
I'll get it.

26:29.277 --> 26:30.294
It's teak.

26:36.069 --> 26:37.069
Mahogany.

26:38.251 --> 26:39.251
Lumber yard.

26:40.903 --> 26:41.913
Oh, no.

26:42.007 --> 26:44.380
We have to now.
It's tradition.

26:56.706 --> 26:57.775
Can I help you?

26:57.909 --> 27:00.951
This is Adrian Monk.
He's gonna be asking you some questions.

27:01.593 --> 27:03.189
- What about?
- You'll find out. First,

27:03.236 --> 27:05.437
there are some ground rules.
No coughing, no sneezing.

27:05.455 --> 27:07.804
You will not shake his hand.
You will not make small talk.

27:07.805 --> 27:08.805
Do you understand?

27:09.527 --> 27:11.581
Lower that sleeve
so it's even with the other one.

27:11.627 --> 27:12.790
He's very particular.

27:22.427 --> 27:23.427
Yes.

27:27.066 --> 27:28.535
Have you seen this dog?

27:29.575 --> 27:30.575
No.

27:31.151 --> 27:32.151
Thank you.

27:33.914 --> 27:36.564
That is four lumber yards down,
one to go.

27:36.675 --> 27:37.675
How am I dong?

27:37.730 --> 27:38.863
Not bad, actually.

27:39.338 --> 27:40.932
Well, if you ever need
an assistant...

27:40.996 --> 27:42.296
Well, I have Natalie.

27:42.962 --> 27:44.163
Maybe it's time
for a change.

27:44.183 --> 27:47.247
Natalie and I have been together for
three and a half years.So I don't thi...

27:47.264 --> 27:48.409
I'll work for free.

27:53.253 --> 27:54.253
What?

27:56.464 --> 27:57.676
You're considering it?

27:58.392 --> 28:02.047
Well, you know...
free.

28:02.449 --> 28:03.449
So?

28:04.745 --> 28:06.145
You wanna make a counter offer?

28:06.253 --> 28:07.942
Yeah, here's my counter offer.

28:08.000 --> 28:09.000
I'm not nuts!

28:10.564 --> 28:12.752
You're right, you're right.
I'm sorry.

28:13.063 --> 28:14.429
It ju...
It's her!

28:14.507 --> 28:16.922
- I get so flustered.
- Mr. Monk, you're not flustered.

28:16.923 --> 28:17.923
You're flattered.

28:18.421 --> 28:19.421
Who wouldn't be?

28:19.609 --> 28:22.210
She adores you.
She knows everything about you.

28:22.664 --> 28:24.190
After all,
you're only human.

28:24.474 --> 28:26.210
There's no need
for name-calling.

28:27.346 --> 28:28.346
You know what?

28:28.545 --> 28:31.644
On second thought,
I think it's a great idea.

28:31.645 --> 28:32.645
What are you doing?

28:32.676 --> 28:35.804
Calling a cab. I'm going home What?!
I'm glad that this happened, actually.

28:35.815 --> 28:38.514
That woman is as obsessive
and compulsive as you are.

28:38.515 --> 28:40.425
I want you to see what it's like.
Go ahead.

28:40.577 --> 28:43.427
Hang out with her, work with her.
I'll call you tomorrow.

28:43.533 --> 28:44.600
We'll compare notes.

28:50.882 --> 28:52.197
It's for the best, boss.

28:55.354 --> 28:57.138
Last weekend was my fault.

28:57.397 --> 28:59.747
Hmm. And the weekend
before that?

29:00.292 --> 29:01.292
That one...

29:03.526 --> 29:05.760
- okay, that was my fault too.
- Mm-hmm.

29:06.594 --> 29:08.909
Look, I've got two detectives
on sick leave.

29:08.910 --> 29:10.124
I have been swamped.

29:10.347 --> 29:13.347
What does a girl have to do
to get your attention, Captain?

29:13.833 --> 29:14.833
Kill someone?

29:23.567 --> 29:24.731
I'm not gonna answer it.

29:26.958 --> 29:30.025
It is... in the briefcase.

29:31.242 --> 29:33.873
It's in the briefcase
and the briefcase is locked.

29:40.168 --> 29:41.537
Now... where were we?

29:45.470 --> 29:46.470
Okay.

29:48.138 --> 29:49.165
Fingertips.

29:49.288 --> 29:51.138
Lt, we caught a break
on that Chinatown thing.

29:51.168 --> 29:52.452
Okay. Give it to Kramer.

29:52.648 --> 29:53.648
Tell him I'm busy.

29:54.208 --> 29:55.208
I am Kramer.

29:55.786 --> 29:56.820
Uh-huh.

29:58.174 --> 29:59.174
Yeah.

30:21.922 --> 30:22.922
ding
It's John Ringel.

30:23.502 --> 30:25.470
That's the guy.
That's the husband.

30:25.719 --> 30:28.078
Oh, yeah,
he owns a lumber yard.

30:29.589 --> 30:30.589
I forgot.

30:30.648 --> 30:32.734
You forgot?!
How could you forget?!

30:32.769 --> 30:35.080
We've been checking
lumber yards all day!

30:35.106 --> 30:36.972
I'm sorry.
I wasn't thinking.

30:37.015 --> 30:38.332
I'm not a perfect person.

30:41.085 --> 30:43.755
- I need a hug.
- No, no more hugs.

30:45.064 --> 30:46.590
Sorry, I was just closing up.

30:47.611 --> 30:48.744
Not you again.

30:48.927 --> 30:50.111
My dog was here.

30:50.119 --> 30:52.740
You kidnapped my dog
two weeks ago!

30:52.802 --> 30:54.661
You really are certifiable,
aren't you?

30:54.855 --> 30:57.141
I told you to stop harassing me.
But that's it.

30:57.142 --> 30:59.842
I'm gonna call my lawyer
and then I'm calling the cops.

31:06.843 --> 31:08.210
Let's just get outta here.

31:09.176 --> 31:10.459
I think he's bluffing.

31:10.959 --> 31:11.959
He's bluffing.

31:15.284 --> 31:16.284
What is it?

31:20.054 --> 31:21.071
It's chew marks.

31:24.312 --> 31:25.312
Look!

31:27.670 --> 31:28.687
Otto!

31:30.180 --> 31:32.247
You are amazing!

31:32.283 --> 31:33.671
What do you wanna call
this case?

31:33.672 --> 31:35.017
I don't know!
Shut up.

31:35.420 --> 31:37.431
How about
"Mr. Monk is Friggin' Awesome"?

31:37.540 --> 31:39.824
How about "Mr. Monk and Marci:
The Adventure Begins"?

31:39.825 --> 31:41.129
It doesn't matter.

31:41.222 --> 31:43.058
Nobody cares about the name.

31:43.408 --> 31:44.408
Just shut it.

31:50.342 --> 31:51.459
Monogrammed wipe.

32:00.944 --> 32:02.061
"Plaster mold.

32:03.796 --> 32:05.045
Do not ingest.

32:09.104 --> 32:14.249
Marci, when Otto died,
did you tell anyone?

32:15.730 --> 32:16.730
No.

32:20.460 --> 32:21.927
Oh, my God.

32:22.719 --> 32:24.990
Don't turn!
Don't... don't... don't turn around.

32:27.151 --> 32:28.361
I think you were right.

32:28.961 --> 32:29.961
He's the guy.

32:31.769 --> 32:33.084
And I know how he did it.

32:33.649 --> 32:35.998
Oh, my gosh.
Say, "Here's what happened.

32:36.464 --> 32:38.664
He must've been planning this forweeks!

32:38.665 --> 32:41.130
- Say, "Here's what happened"!
- Shh.

32:41.937 --> 32:43.042
Here's what happened.

32:45.059 --> 32:47.910
John Ringel realized
he could murder his wife

32:48.490 --> 32:49.805
and blame it
on your dog.

32:50.489 --> 32:52.284
Nobody would ever question it.

32:52.430 --> 32:55.005
Everybody knew
Otto was a little wild.

32:56.381 --> 32:57.384
What are you doing?

32:57.417 --> 32:59.690
There's no hugging during
the "Here's what happened. "

32:59.749 --> 33:01.794
- Sorry, go on.
- Just stand over there.

33:03.799 --> 33:05.466
That day Otto disappeared

33:05.962 --> 33:08.779
Ringel must've
brought him here, drugged him,

33:09.084 --> 33:11.481
and made an impression
of his teeth.

33:12.077 --> 33:13.594
Oh, poor Otto!

33:20.748 --> 33:24.169
Then Ringel built a lethal weapon
using the mold of Otto's teeth.

33:25.245 --> 33:26.793
It couldn't have been
too hard.

33:26.980 --> 33:30.644
After all, he owns a lumber yard.
He had all the equipment he needed.

33:38.410 --> 33:39.410
Then he waited.

33:40.781 --> 33:41.964
He was in no rush.

33:42.671 --> 33:45.905
One week, two weeks, until finally,

33:46.042 --> 33:47.275
she was alone.

33:54.031 --> 33:56.661
He knew the bite marks
would match up perfectly.

33:56.695 --> 33:58.133
The cops... everyone...

33:58.191 --> 33:59.854
would assume it was your dog.

34:00.004 --> 34:03.855
It was a perfect crime,
except for one thing.

34:05.532 --> 34:07.349
He had waited too long.

34:07.488 --> 34:10.271
He didn't know that Otto
had died three days earlier.

34:10.427 --> 34:12.627
He was framing a dead dog!

34:13.913 --> 34:14.929
Wow.

34:15.414 --> 34:17.031
That is incredible!

34:18.837 --> 34:19.837
Where did he go?

34:19.885 --> 34:22.335
Do it one more time for the website.

34:22.447 --> 34:24.411
What are you doing?!
I'm not gonna say it again.

34:24.413 --> 34:25.875
You don't have to do the whole thing.

34:25.887 --> 34:27.469
Say how you know how he killed his wife.

34:27.504 --> 34:28.844
Would you keep your voice down?

34:28.846 --> 34:30.071
He's gonna hear us.

34:30.909 --> 34:31.909
Too late.

34:32.502 --> 34:33.802
I already heard ya.

34:41.136 --> 34:44.052
Shut up and don't move.

34:45.333 --> 34:47.634
- Shoot him.
- I don't have a gun.

34:48.003 --> 34:50.219
You did in "Mr. Monk
and The Dragon's Lair. "

34:50.498 --> 34:51.498
The what?!

34:51.933 --> 34:53.556
Oh, wait.
I made that one up.

34:53.804 --> 34:56.678
- It's called "fan fiction. "
- I said...

34:56.864 --> 34:57.864
shut up!

34:59.761 --> 35:01.127
Son of a bitch!

35:15.586 --> 35:16.586
What is it?

35:17.456 --> 35:20.250
Leland,
this is not very romantic.

35:21.135 --> 35:22.516
What are you looking at?

35:23.445 --> 35:24.528
Bite marks.

35:25.130 --> 35:27.463
I'm afraid to ask.

35:30.433 --> 35:31.643
Look at the bite marks.

35:32.388 --> 35:33.522
That woman was...

35:33.613 --> 35:35.013
attacked by a dog.

35:35.675 --> 35:37.541
- Look at the bite marks.
- No, thank you.

35:38.199 --> 35:39.499
They're all upside down.

35:41.228 --> 35:42.491
Even the defensive ones.

35:50.077 --> 35:51.294
I gotta make
a phone call.

36:00.799 --> 36:02.508
No, it's me.
I'm trying to find him.

36:13.451 --> 36:14.468
Disher.

36:14.571 --> 36:17.005
Randy, meet me
at 420 Vinton Street.

36:17.025 --> 36:19.865
It's a lumber yard it's owned
by John Ringel.Chop chop.

36:20.205 --> 36:21.245
Who's John Ringel?

36:21.280 --> 36:23.516
As of ten minutes ago,
he's a murder suspect.

36:23.556 --> 36:25.926
Monk is there now.
I think he might be in trouble.

36:25.974 --> 36:26.991
I'm on my way.

36:29.878 --> 36:31.532
You still playing
that stupid game?

36:32.903 --> 36:33.919
Randy?

36:34.620 --> 36:35.620
Randy?

36:36.680 --> 36:37.680
No.

36:56.769 --> 36:57.836
What is this?

36:58.906 --> 37:00.208
Is this blood?

37:00.643 --> 37:03.578
- You've been shot.
- Oh, my God! I've been shot!

37:03.624 --> 37:05.545
It's okay.
It's just a scratch.

37:05.607 --> 37:07.811
- What am I doing here?
- Shut up.

37:07.880 --> 37:09.065
This isn't fun anymore.

37:09.066 --> 37:10.125
Why did you bring me here?

37:10.198 --> 37:12.370
I didn't bring you here!

37:12.405 --> 37:13.465
I don't wanna do this.

37:13.498 --> 37:15.894
I hate this.
Excuse me pause.

37:17.131 --> 37:20.248
Pause, please.
If we could just put a pause on this...

37:21.040 --> 37:23.840
for a second.
I wanna go home.

37:24.166 --> 37:26.748
And I know,
but I am absolutely

37:26.787 --> 37:29.378
not gonna say anything about you killing
your wife.

37:29.658 --> 37:30.658
It's no biggie.

37:31.095 --> 37:33.709
I mean, she was asking for it.
I've seen her out there.

37:33.756 --> 37:34.797
I'm your neighbor.

37:34.798 --> 37:36.843
I've seen her in the garden
with her flower pot

37:36.949 --> 37:40.306
going blah, blah, blah.
My gardenias are awesome.

37:41.881 --> 37:43.533
So I'm just gonna go.

37:43.649 --> 37:44.971
Yeah,
I don't think so!

37:47.067 --> 37:48.067
Monk!

37:49.251 --> 37:50.251
Come on out!

37:50.937 --> 37:52.225
I have your girlfriend!

37:52.310 --> 37:54.698
I'm not his girlfriend.
I don't even like him anymore.

37:56.989 --> 37:57.989
Monk?

37:59.923 --> 38:01.291
Come out or I'll kill her.

38:02.692 --> 38:03.792
Okay, right here.

38:13.508 --> 38:14.775
Natalie, stay back.

38:31.997 --> 38:34.243
- Where's your car, Marci?
- Out front.

38:34.244 --> 38:35.717
I hope you have
a full tank.

38:36.353 --> 38:39.049
- We got a long trip ahead of us.
- Listen.

38:39.050 --> 38:41.130
I have to sit in the front.
It's one of my things.

38:41.163 --> 38:43.135
Yeah,
he's got a million "things. "

38:43.395 --> 38:45.112
I don't know
what I was thinking.

38:46.662 --> 38:48.680
SFPD!
Drop the weapon!

38:53.355 --> 38:56.505
Go, go, go!
Go, go, go, go!

38:58.741 --> 38:59.808
Where is he?

38:59.835 --> 39:01.069
I can't get a shot.

39:02.291 --> 39:04.091
Go around.
Go around!

39:37.005 --> 39:38.038
What are you doing?

39:58.152 --> 40:00.211
Let me see your hands!
Let's see 'em.

40:13.166 --> 40:14.166
Stupid game, huh?

40:19.406 --> 40:21.037
- What is it?
- Oh, it's...

40:21.163 --> 40:22.480
it's from Marci.

40:23.933 --> 40:24.953
"Adrian, I'm sorry.

40:25.004 --> 40:26.884
"I can't have your things
in my house anymore.

40:26.934 --> 40:30.482
"How would I ever explain them
to Fff-Murray Abraham?

40:30.708 --> 40:32.142
F.Murray Abraham.

40:32.384 --> 40:34.763
- The actor.
- May God have mercy on his soul.

40:35.836 --> 40:40.131
- Your pants are back.
- I'd already thrown this stuff out.

40:40.666 --> 40:41.683
Oh, hey. Look.

40:42.279 --> 40:43.279
It's you.

40:43.380 --> 40:46.147
Oh, Adrian, I adore you.

40:46.173 --> 40:47.234
Aren't you amazing?

40:47.235 --> 40:49.003
I love everything you say
and do.

40:49.168 --> 40:50.202
All right.

40:50.304 --> 40:52.290
- It wasn't like that.
- Thank you, Marci.

40:52.356 --> 40:53.655
I think you have excellent taste.

40:53.661 --> 40:55.322
You'd like to be my new assistant?

40:55.346 --> 40:57.368
You could follow me around
and worship me all day.

40:57.392 --> 40:58.441
Cut it out, will you?

40:58.476 --> 41:00.744
And let's seal the deal
with a great big clue hug.

41:00.899 --> 41:02.749
Clue hug!
Clue hug!

41:02.816 --> 41:04.157
- Clue hug!
- Stop it.

41:04.208 --> 41:06.078
Oh, I love you.
I'm your biggest fan.

41:06.110 --> 41:07.602
I just want a little clue hug!

41:07.618 --> 41:09.106
Cut it out. I know it's you.

41:09.145 --> 41:11.045
Clue hug, clue hug.
