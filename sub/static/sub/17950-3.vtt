WEBVTT

00:09.210 --> 00:10.778
- ALL AGENTS REPORT.

00:10.778 --> 00:12.513
I REPORT, ALL AGENTS REPORT.

00:12.513 --> 00:14.315
OVER!

00:14.315 --> 00:16.550
- NO EYES ON RED FALCON
ON THE FOURTH FLOOR.

00:16.550 --> 00:18.686
KSSSH!

00:18.686 --> 00:20.288
- SHE'S NOT AT THE POOL.

00:20.288 --> 00:21.522
- ARE YOU SUNNING BY THE POOL,

00:21.522 --> 00:24.392
SURROUNDED BY GIRLS
IN SUNGLASSES?

00:24.392 --> 00:25.659
- WHAT?
NO.

00:25.659 --> 00:27.495
I'M GOING THROUGH A TUNNEL.
KSSSH!

00:27.495 --> 00:30.198
RECEPTION--TUNNEL--SHWSHW!

00:30.198 --> 00:33.134
- LOGAN, HAVE YOU SPOTTED THE
NEST?

00:33.134 --> 00:35.636
- I AM UNABLE TO HACK
INTO BITTERS' SYSTEM,

00:35.636 --> 00:39.640
AND I'M A LITTLE FREAKED OUT
BY HIS SCREEN SAVER.

00:42.376 --> 00:44.212
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

00:44.212 --> 00:48.382
- COVERT OPERATIONS TO FIND OUT
WHICH APARTMENT LUCY MOVED INTO

00:48.382 --> 00:50.318
SO I CAN AVOID HER AT ALL COSTS.

00:50.318 --> 00:52.653
- HONEY, SHE LIVES HERE NOW,

00:52.653 --> 00:54.955
AND YOU AND JOE WILL
JUST HAVE TO DEAL WITH THIS.

00:54.955 --> 00:56.824
- NEGATORY.

00:56.824 --> 00:58.892
BECAUSE I HAVE A TEAM
OF SPECIAL OPS

00:58.892 --> 01:01.995
THAT WILL MAKE SURE
LUCY NEVER COMES BETWEEN US.

01:01.995 --> 01:04.332
OVER.
KSHH!

01:05.633 --> 01:07.301
- READY FOR OUR POOL DATE?

01:07.301 --> 01:08.402
- YEP!

01:08.402 --> 01:11.272
AND NO ONE WILL COME BETWEEN US.

01:11.272 --> 01:13.407
- OH, HEY GUYS.

01:13.407 --> 01:16.144
UH, YOU HEADED TO THE POOL?

01:16.144 --> 01:18.146
- * MAKE IT COUNT,

01:18.146 --> 01:19.913
* DON'T LOOK BACK,
DON'T HESITATE *

01:19.913 --> 01:24.051
- * WHEN YOU GO BIG TIME

01:24.051 --> 01:25.919
- * WHAT YOU WANT,
WHAT YOU FEEL *

01:25.919 --> 01:27.888
* NEVER QUIT
AND MAKE IT REAL *

01:27.888 --> 01:31.192
- * WHEN YOU ROLL BIG TIME

01:31.192 --> 01:32.193
- * OH-OH, OH-OH

01:32.193 --> 01:34.162
- * HEY, HEY

01:34.162 --> 01:36.264
- * LISTEN TO YOUR HEART NOW

01:36.264 --> 01:38.266
- * HEY, HEY

01:38.266 --> 01:40.168
- * DON'T YOU FEEL THE RUSH *

01:40.168 --> 01:42.069
- * OH-OH, OH-OH

01:42.069 --> 01:44.338
* OH-OH, OH-OH

01:44.338 --> 01:45.573
- * GO AND SHAKE IT UP

01:45.573 --> 01:48.041
* WHATCHA GOTTA LOSE?

01:48.041 --> 01:49.610
* GO AND MAKE YOUR LUCK

01:49.610 --> 01:52.280
* WITH THE LIFE YOU CHOOSE

01:52.280 --> 01:55.583
* IF YOU WANT IT ALL,
LAY IT ON THE LINE *

01:55.583 --> 02:00.188
* IT'S THE ONLY LIFE YOU GOT
SO YOU GOT TO LIVE IT BIG TIME *

02:03.457 --> 02:04.925
- THIS IS SO AWKWARD.
- MM-HMM.

02:04.925 --> 02:07.027
I CAN'T IMAGINE
WHAT JO MUST BE GOING THROUGH.

02:07.027 --> 02:08.229
- I KNOW.

02:08.229 --> 02:09.297
IT'S LIKE KENDALL'S
EX-GIRLFRIEND

02:09.297 --> 02:11.832
IS LITERALLY LIVING
IN BETWEEN THEM.

02:11.832 --> 02:13.267
- GUYS, WE'RE RIGHT HERE.

02:13.267 --> 02:14.602
- AND ANYWAY,

02:14.602 --> 02:18.206
LUCY MOVING BACK TO THE
PALMWOODS DOESN'T BOTHER ME.

02:18.206 --> 02:20.208
SEE?

02:23.076 --> 02:24.212
- OH, QUICK!
SHE'S COMING OVER HERE!

02:24.212 --> 02:25.379
ACT NATURAL!

02:25.379 --> 02:26.380
- BE COOL! BE COOL!

02:26.380 --> 02:29.317
[all muttering]

02:31.319 --> 02:34.622
- HEY, GUYS.

02:34.622 --> 02:35.756
- 'SUP?

02:35.756 --> 02:37.691
YOU KNOW, JUST ACTIN' NATURAL.

02:37.691 --> 02:40.428
WHY'D YOU MOVE BACK IN?

02:40.428 --> 02:43.297
- LOOK, I DIDN'T MOVE BACK
TO START ANY DRAMA,

02:43.297 --> 02:45.065
BUT MY ALBUM'S
ALL ABOUT BEING STRONG

02:45.065 --> 02:46.667
AND DOING WHAT MAKES YOU HAPPY,

02:46.667 --> 02:49.570
AND THE PALMWOODS MAKES ME
HAPPY,

02:49.570 --> 02:51.272
SO I'M BACK.

02:51.272 --> 02:52.373
- OKAY.

02:52.373 --> 02:56.444
NOW THAT THAT'S OUT OF THE WAY,

02:56.444 --> 02:58.579
CARLOS AND I ARE
OFF TO ROCQUE RECORDS.

02:58.579 --> 02:59.813
WHY DON'T YOU TAG ALONG,

02:59.813 --> 03:01.649
AND YOU AND I CAN--
I DON'T KNOW--MAKE OUT.

03:01.649 --> 03:02.750
- JAMES.

03:02.750 --> 03:04.752
I'D RATHER EAT HAIR.

03:04.752 --> 03:06.687
- YOU WILL BE MINE!

03:08.021 --> 03:09.122
- ANYWAY.

03:09.122 --> 03:10.791
I DON'T WANT THINGS
TO BE AWKWARD,

03:10.791 --> 03:12.560
SO I HOPE WE CAN BE FRIENDS.

03:12.560 --> 03:14.295
- I'D LIKE THAT.
- ME TOO.

03:14.295 --> 03:15.663
[nervous laughter]

03:15.663 --> 03:18.031
- SEE YOU.

03:18.031 --> 03:20.501
[nervous chuckling]

03:20.501 --> 03:23.136
- WELL, THIS IS GONNA END BADLY.

03:26.274 --> 03:27.341
- WHOO!

03:27.341 --> 03:29.577
NOTHING KILLS
WAIT-FOR-GUSTAVO TIME

03:29.577 --> 03:32.346
LIKE A LITTLE SODA BOWLING.

03:32.346 --> 03:34.114
- OKAY, IF I MAKE THIS STRIKE,

03:34.114 --> 03:35.816
THAT MEANS LUCY
TOTALLY LIKES ME,

03:35.816 --> 03:39.987
AND WE'LL BE DATING VERY SOON.

03:39.987 --> 03:40.988
- HEY!

03:40.988 --> 03:42.556
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

03:42.556 --> 03:44.892
- SODA BOWLING FOR LOVE.

03:44.892 --> 03:46.994
- WELL, DON'T!

03:46.994 --> 03:48.562
- GO PUT THE SODAS
BACK IN THE PANTRY,

03:48.562 --> 03:50.130
AND WARM UP YOUR VOICES.

03:50.130 --> 03:51.932
- YEAH, WE'RE GONNA PICK OUT
SOME NEW MICROPHONES,

03:51.932 --> 03:56.404
AND I NEED MY STUDIO A-TIDY
WHEN I GET A-BACK.

03:56.404 --> 03:59.340
[both sing scales]

04:03.176 --> 04:04.177
- OH, THEY'RE GONE!

04:04.177 --> 04:05.178
- [chuckles]

04:05.178 --> 04:06.179
- GO, GO, GO, GO, GO!

04:06.179 --> 04:08.115
- THIS IS FOR LOVE!

04:13.020 --> 04:14.422
- [gasps]

04:14.422 --> 04:15.856
- DON'T WORRY.

04:15.856 --> 04:18.659
IT'S NOT A PROBLEM
AS LONG AS THE SODA DOESN'T--

04:18.659 --> 04:19.693
[hissing]

04:19.693 --> 04:20.894
[shrieking]

04:20.894 --> 04:24.398
[ricocheting and crashing]

04:24.398 --> 04:26.334
[glass shatters]

04:28.201 --> 04:29.570
[screaming]

04:34.642 --> 04:35.576
[crashing]

04:37.611 --> 04:38.846
- ACCORDING TO THIS,

04:38.846 --> 04:40.748
GEORGE WASHINGTON'S BEST FRIEND
WAS AN EAGLE

04:40.748 --> 04:42.450
AND HE LIVED IN A PYRAMID.

04:42.450 --> 04:44.352
HOMEWORK: DONE.

04:44.352 --> 04:46.854
- ARE YOU LOOKING AT A DOLLAR
BILL?

04:46.854 --> 04:48.188
- MAYBE.

04:48.188 --> 04:50.358
- TRY READING THE BOOK.

04:50.358 --> 04:51.625
- [coughing]

04:51.625 --> 04:53.160
- OH, SWEETIE,
ARE YOU GETTING SICK?

04:53.160 --> 04:54.362
- [coughs]

04:54.362 --> 04:55.396
NOPE.

04:55.396 --> 04:56.697
- ARE YOU ABOUT TO TELL A LIE?

04:56.697 --> 04:57.698
- YEP.

04:57.698 --> 04:59.500
[knocking]

04:59.500 --> 05:02.269
[coughing]

05:02.269 --> 05:03.404
HEY.

05:03.404 --> 05:05.473
- HEY, YOU.
READY TO GO TO THE PLAY?

05:05.473 --> 05:09.977
FOUR HOURS OF EXPERIMENTAL
SHADOW ACTING AND WATER SOUNDS!

05:09.977 --> 05:11.679
- OH, IT SOUNDS GREAT, BUT...

05:11.679 --> 05:13.847
[coughing]

05:13.847 --> 05:15.215
I THINK I'M GETTING
A LITTLE SICK.

05:15.215 --> 05:18.251
- OH, NO.

05:18.251 --> 05:19.653
THAT'S TERRIBLE.

05:19.653 --> 05:21.389
- WELL, BYE.

05:21.389 --> 05:25.125
- THE ONLY PLACE YOU'RE GOING
IS TO DOC HOLLYWOOD

05:25.125 --> 05:26.159
RIGHT NOW.

05:26.159 --> 05:27.160
- WHAT?
UH, NO.

05:27.160 --> 05:29.430
NO, UH--HELP!

05:29.430 --> 05:30.498
- SEE?

05:30.498 --> 05:32.165
LYING GETS YOU NOWHERE.

05:32.165 --> 05:33.166
- YOU'RE RIGHT, MOM.

05:33.166 --> 05:34.234
I AGREE WITH YOU.

05:34.234 --> 05:35.403
- REALLY?
- NO.

05:35.403 --> 05:37.104
I'M LYING.

05:37.104 --> 05:39.006
- * DO IT LIKE NOBODY'S AROUND *

05:39.006 --> 05:40.207
- THAT WAS BIG TIME RUSH'S
LATEST HIT.

05:40.207 --> 05:41.675
AND NOW, HERE'S LUCY STONE.

05:41.675 --> 05:44.244
- * YOU DUMPED ME FOR HER?

05:44.244 --> 05:45.245
* YOU--

05:45.245 --> 05:48.215
* KISS ME IN AN ELEVATOR

05:48.215 --> 05:51.685
* YOU DUMPED ME FOR HER?

05:51.685 --> 05:54.221
- YOU'RE LISTENING TO ALL NEWS,
ALL THE TIME,

05:54.221 --> 05:55.656
EXCEPT FOR LUCY STONE'S
NEWEST HIT,

05:55.656 --> 05:56.724
YOU DUMPED ME.

05:56.724 --> 05:58.526
- * YOU DUMPED ME FOR HER?

05:58.526 --> 05:59.460
splash!

06:01.862 --> 06:04.965
- THINK I'M GONNA GO GET
MY MP3 PLAYER.

06:06.734 --> 06:08.536
- DON'T GET IN ANY ELEVATORS
WITH ANYONE.

06:08.536 --> 06:13.040
- THAT IS FUNNY BECAUSE
LUCY LIVING HERE IS FUNNY.

06:13.040 --> 06:13.974
[laughs]

06:16.276 --> 06:17.511
WHOA!

06:17.511 --> 06:18.446
- I'M WELDING THINGS.

06:26.053 --> 06:27.054
- [shudders]

06:27.054 --> 06:27.988
- HI, KENDALL.

06:30.524 --> 06:34.194
- THIS WOULD BE AWKWARD
IF WE WEREN'T JUST FRIENDS NOW.

06:34.194 --> 06:36.464
[forced laughter]

06:36.464 --> 06:37.465
WHOA.

06:37.465 --> 06:38.766
- YEAH, ABOUT THAT.

06:38.766 --> 06:40.534
- UH, WE SHOULD STOP.

06:40.534 --> 06:42.670
- YOU'RE RIGHT.

06:42.670 --> 06:46.774
- THAT'S NOT WHAT I MEANT.

06:46.774 --> 06:49.242
- KENDALL,
WE'VE DONE THIS BEFORE,

06:49.242 --> 06:52.012
AND I THINK YOU KNOW
WHAT COMES NEXT.

06:52.012 --> 06:53.246
[bell dings]

06:53.246 --> 06:56.484
- THIS IS ME.

06:56.484 --> 06:58.786
- THAT'S NOT WHAT COMES NEXT.

06:58.786 --> 07:01.522
- GUSTAVO SAID NOT TO SODA BOWL
IN THE STUDIO.

07:01.522 --> 07:02.656
WE DID.

07:02.656 --> 07:03.657
crash!

07:03.657 --> 07:04.658
AND WE'RE DEAD.

07:04.658 --> 07:06.527
- WE CAN FIX THIS.

07:06.527 --> 07:08.696
WATCH.

07:08.696 --> 07:09.897
HUH?

07:09.897 --> 07:11.665
crash!

07:11.665 --> 07:13.567
- WE GOT TO TELL 'EM THE TRUTH.

07:13.567 --> 07:16.704
JUST COME CLEAN AND ACCEPT
THE CONSEQUENCES LIKE MEN.

07:16.704 --> 07:18.506
- YOU'RE RIGHT.

07:18.506 --> 07:20.741
WE GOT TO TELL 'EM THE TRUTH.

07:20.741 --> 07:23.677
OR...

07:23.677 --> 07:24.845
- TRACKS 2, 2, 4--

07:24.845 --> 07:27.781
[muffled yelling]
WE WERE ROBBED!

07:29.517 --> 07:30.784
[mumbling]

07:30.784 --> 07:31.952
- [screams]

07:31.952 --> 07:33.554
- COME ON.

07:33.554 --> 07:34.555
COME ON!

07:34.555 --> 07:37.758
COME ON!

07:37.758 --> 07:41.061
NOW DO YOU WANT A SWORD
OR A PUPPY?

07:41.061 --> 07:42.996
- I WANT YOU TO HELP LOGAN.

07:42.996 --> 07:44.532
HE'S REALLY SICK.

07:44.532 --> 07:45.566
- [coughing]
REALLY SICK.

07:45.566 --> 07:46.834
[balloon sputters]

07:46.834 --> 07:48.135
- SOUNDS SERIOUS.

07:48.135 --> 07:50.538
STEP INTO MY EXAM ROOM
AND WE'LL TAKE A LOOK.

07:50.538 --> 07:52.405
- [coughing]

07:54.942 --> 07:56.844
- OKAY, SO WHY ARE YOU LYING?

07:56.844 --> 07:58.445
- WHAT?
HOW'D YOU KNOW?

07:58.445 --> 08:00.948
- BECAUSE I'M A DOCTOR
AND A MAN.

08:00.948 --> 08:02.583
NOW DETAILS.

08:02.583 --> 08:05.553
- CAMILLE WANTS ME TO GO TO A--

08:05.553 --> 08:08.722
SHADOW ACTING WATER PLAY,
BUT I DON'T WANT TO GO,

08:08.722 --> 08:11.224
SO I SAID I WAS SICK,

08:11.224 --> 08:13.727
AND NOW I NEED YOU
TO BACK ME UP.

08:13.727 --> 08:16.296
- YOU WANT ME TO LIE?

08:16.296 --> 08:17.798
BUT I COULD LOSE
MY MEDICAL LICENSE.

08:17.798 --> 08:19.066
AGAIN.

08:19.066 --> 08:22.302
- UH, DID I MENTION THE PLAY
IS FOUR HOURS LONG?

08:22.302 --> 08:24.572
- [gasps]

08:24.572 --> 08:26.974
CAMILLE, YOU MIGHT AS WELL GO
TO YOUR PLAY

08:26.974 --> 08:30.310
BECAUSE I'M GONNA BE VERY BUSY
RUNNING TESTS ON LOGAN.

08:30.310 --> 08:32.079
- [coughs]

08:32.079 --> 08:34.114
- IT'S VERY SERIOUS.

08:34.114 --> 08:35.649
- REALLY?
- MM.

08:35.649 --> 08:38.619
- IF IT'S SERIOUS,
THEN I'M NOT GOING ANYWHERE.

08:38.619 --> 08:42.222
TELL HIM I'M RIGHT HERE
FOR HIM IF HE NEEDS ME.

08:42.222 --> 08:44.658
- COOL.

08:44.658 --> 08:45.926
- WHY DID YOU SAY
IT WAS SERIOUS?

08:45.926 --> 08:48.696
- CAUSE IT SOUNDED MEDICAL.

08:48.696 --> 08:50.263
- WHAT AM I GONNA DO?

08:50.263 --> 08:52.332
- IF JO FINDS OUT
THAT I RAN INTO LUCY,

08:52.332 --> 08:54.234
THINGS ARE GONNA GET WEIRD
AND AWKWARD.

08:54.234 --> 08:57.004
- YOU OWE IT TO JO
TO TELL HER THE TRUTH.

08:57.004 --> 08:59.506
AND REMEMBER WHAT GEORGE
WASHINGTON SAID.

08:59.506 --> 09:01.875
YOU SHOULD NEVER TELL A LIE.

09:01.875 --> 09:04.244
- OR JUST WAIT IT OUT.

09:04.244 --> 09:06.614
LUCY'LL EVENTUALLY GET
THAT YOU'RE NOT INTERESTED,

09:06.614 --> 09:09.182
BACK OFF, AND NOBODY GETS HURT.

09:09.182 --> 09:10.250
- NOBODY GETS HURT.

09:10.250 --> 09:12.219
THAT'S GOOD, AND I LIKE GOOD.

09:12.219 --> 09:14.254
- NOT TELLING JO IS LYING.

09:14.254 --> 09:16.724
AND REMEMBER WHAT ELSE
GEORGE WASHINGTON SAID.

09:16.724 --> 09:18.358
LIAR, LIAR, PANTS ON FIRE.

09:18.358 --> 09:20.460
- HE DIDN'T SAY THAT.
- YES, HE DID.

09:20.460 --> 09:22.095
- UM, OKAY.

09:22.095 --> 09:24.698
THANK YOU BOTH
FOR YOUR CONFUSING ADVICE,

09:24.698 --> 09:26.499
BUT I'M GONNA GO
BACK DOWN TO THE POOL

09:26.499 --> 09:28.669
AND PRAY I DON'T RUN INTO LUCY.

09:42.449 --> 09:45.753
DARN IT!

09:45.753 --> 09:47.320
- HI, KENDALL.

09:47.320 --> 09:49.990
NOW WHERE WERE WE?

09:49.990 --> 09:51.258
- UH, YEAH.

09:51.258 --> 09:52.359
JUST ABOUT THERE.

09:52.359 --> 09:53.927
UM, LOOK, YOU'RE, UH--

09:53.927 --> 09:55.896
LUCY, I JUST WANT TO GO SEE JO,

09:55.896 --> 09:57.530
WHO'S AT THE POOL

09:57.530 --> 10:01.368
BECAUSE I DON'T WANT THINGS
TO GET, LIKE, WEIRD AND AWKWARD.

10:01.368 --> 10:02.302
[bell dings]

10:06.606 --> 10:08.642
OH.

10:08.642 --> 10:10.343
- HEY, JO.

10:10.343 --> 10:13.446
- [laughs nervously]

10:13.446 --> 10:14.715
- GOT THE MUSIC.

10:14.715 --> 10:16.249
- DID SOMETHING HAPPEN IN THERE?

10:16.249 --> 10:18.618
- UM...

10:18.618 --> 10:20.220
- TELL HER THE TRUTH.

10:20.220 --> 10:23.590
REMEMBER, LIAR, LIAR,
PANTS ON FIRE.

10:23.590 --> 10:25.859
- NO, LIE.

10:25.859 --> 10:26.927
THAT WAY NOBODY GETS HURT.

10:26.927 --> 10:27.928
- TRUTH!

10:27.928 --> 10:28.996
- LIE TO HER.
- TRUTH!

10:28.996 --> 10:29.997
- LIE.
- TRUTH.

10:29.997 --> 10:33.000
- LIE.
- TRUTH!

10:33.000 --> 10:36.770
- OH, IN THERE?

10:36.770 --> 10:38.005
NOPE.

10:38.005 --> 10:41.608
ABSOLUTELY NOTHING HAPPENED
IN THERE.

10:43.977 --> 10:46.113
DO YOU SMELL SOMETHING BURNING?

10:46.113 --> 10:47.147
- YUP.

10:47.147 --> 10:49.649
YOUR PANTS ARE ON FIRE.

10:49.649 --> 10:51.384
- OH!
- [shrieks]

10:51.384 --> 10:53.821
PANTS ON FIRE!

10:53.821 --> 10:54.755
splash!

10:59.092 --> 11:00.728
- HEY.

11:00.728 --> 11:02.162
- STOP!

11:02.162 --> 11:04.231
- DID YOU LIE?

11:04.231 --> 11:05.298
- YEP.

11:05.298 --> 11:06.333
LUCY WANTS ME BACK,

11:06.333 --> 11:07.735
JO WANTS THE TRUTH,

11:07.735 --> 11:10.237
YOU TWO KEEP APPEARING
ON MY SHOULDERS,

11:10.237 --> 11:12.405
AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO.

11:12.405 --> 11:15.375
- FIRST, STOP LYING,

11:15.375 --> 11:16.844
AND SECOND, IT'S LAUNDRY DAY,

11:16.844 --> 11:18.912
AND YOU ONLY HAVE
ONE OTHER PAIR OF PANTS.

11:18.912 --> 11:21.782
- OR JUST NEVER LEAVE JO'S SIDE.

11:21.782 --> 11:23.917
LUCY WON'T FLIRT WITH YOU
IN FRONT OF JO.

11:23.917 --> 11:26.954
EVENTUALLY, SHE'LL STOP TRYING,
AND PROBLEM SOLVED.

11:26.954 --> 11:29.656
- PROBLEM NOT SOLVED.

11:29.656 --> 11:32.893
YOU, ZIP IT,
AND FINISH YOUR PROJECT.

11:32.893 --> 11:35.562
YOU, TELL JO THE TRUTH,

11:35.562 --> 11:37.397
OR I AM GONNA BE
VERY DISAPPOINTED.

11:37.397 --> 11:38.465
- YOU KNOW WHAT, MOM?

11:38.465 --> 11:39.933
YOU'RE RIGHT.

11:39.933 --> 11:42.770
YOU'RE GOING TO BE
VERY DISAPPOINTED.

11:42.770 --> 11:43.837
[siren whoops]

11:43.837 --> 11:46.373
- MY "WORLD'S ANGRIEST
PRODUCER" AWARD,

11:46.373 --> 11:49.142
MY "EVERYTHING'S BIGGER
IN TEXAS" MUG...

11:49.142 --> 11:50.911
YOU HAVE TO FIND THIS GUY!

11:50.911 --> 11:54.614
- WHICH IS WHY WE NEED TO KNOW
WHAT DID THIS ROBBER LOOK LIKE?

11:54.614 --> 11:56.483
[together]
WHAT DID HE LOOK LIKE?

11:56.483 --> 11:58.786
[muttering over each other]

11:58.786 --> 11:59.787
- [clears throat]

11:59.787 --> 12:01.121
- COWBOY.
- PIRATE.

12:01.121 --> 12:03.857
- A COWBOY PIRATE?

12:03.857 --> 12:05.392
- UH-HUH.
- YEP.

12:05.392 --> 12:07.560
- PUT OUT AN A.P.B. ON A...

12:07.560 --> 12:09.863
COWBOY PIRATE.

12:09.863 --> 12:13.700
AND YOU TWO, I NEED TO SEE A
LIST OF ALL THE ITEMS DESTROYED.

12:13.700 --> 12:15.468
- [yelling]

12:15.468 --> 12:17.805
- I FEEL SO GUILTY LYING.

12:17.805 --> 12:18.906
- SHH.

12:18.906 --> 12:19.973
DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT, ALL RIGHT?

12:19.973 --> 12:21.809
THIS CASE IS
GONNA REMAIN UNSOLVED,

12:21.809 --> 12:23.176
AND WE'RE GONNA REMAIN
UN IN TROUBLE

12:23.176 --> 12:26.113
BECAUSE THEY'RE NEVER GONNA FIND
A COWBOY PIRATE.

12:26.113 --> 12:27.848
[laughter]

12:30.583 --> 12:35.055
- OKAY, SO WHICH ONE IS IT?

12:35.055 --> 12:37.925
- IS IT COWBOY PIRATE
NUMBER TWO?

12:37.925 --> 12:40.127
OR IS IT THE ONE
WITH THE PARROT?

12:40.127 --> 12:41.528
[parrot squawks "Hello"]

12:41.528 --> 12:46.433
- OR IS IT ALL SOME BIG LIE?

12:46.433 --> 12:47.534
- OKAY.

12:47.534 --> 12:48.836
LOOK, THE TRUTH IS--

12:48.836 --> 12:50.737
- IT WAS NUMBER TWO!

12:59.679 --> 13:01.281
- [sighs]

13:01.281 --> 13:03.316
- LOGAN, JUST TELL CAMILLE
THE TRUTH

13:03.316 --> 13:05.185
AND GO TO HER AWFUL PLAY.

13:05.185 --> 13:06.353
- ADMIT I LIED?

13:06.353 --> 13:08.155
THAT'S WORSE THAN LYING.

13:08.155 --> 13:10.057
NOW PRINT ME UP A BUNCH
OF TERRIBLE SYMPTOMS

13:10.057 --> 13:11.091
THAT SHE'LL BELIEVE.

13:11.091 --> 13:12.092
- [groans]

13:14.327 --> 13:17.530
OKAY, CAMILLE, ACCORDING
TO THESE REAL TEST RESULTS,

13:17.530 --> 13:20.233
LOGAN IS SUFFERING
FROM LOW HAIR PRESSURE,

13:20.233 --> 13:23.436
PAINFUL RASHES,
AND SKIN FAILURE.

13:23.436 --> 13:25.973
SO I'M PRESCRIBING HIM TO STAY

13:25.973 --> 13:30.143
FOR HOWEVER LONG
THIS PLAY THING IS

13:30.143 --> 13:33.346
AND FOR YOU TO GO.

13:33.346 --> 13:37.250
- WELL, YOU JUST DESCRIBED
MABONGO FEVER.

13:37.250 --> 13:40.120
AND SINCE YOU'VE BEEN
IN AN ENCLOSED ROOM WITH HIM

13:40.120 --> 13:43.023
FOR THE PAST HALF HOUR,
YOU'RE INFECTED, TOO,

13:43.023 --> 13:47.227
AND YOU BOTH NEED TO BE
QUARANTINED.

13:47.227 --> 13:52.199
EITHER THAT OR THE TWO OF YOU
ARE LYING.

13:52.199 --> 13:54.334
- [coughing]

13:54.334 --> 13:56.169
- YOU GUYS ARE PATHETIC.

13:56.169 --> 13:57.704
- BUT WE'RE NOT LYING.

13:57.704 --> 13:58.705
- YEAH!

13:58.705 --> 14:00.640
- [coughing]

14:03.110 --> 14:04.044
'SCUSE ME.

14:08.448 --> 14:10.750
- WHY ARE YOU WALKING
SO CLOSE TO ME?

14:10.750 --> 14:12.685
- BECAUSE WE'RE CLOSE.

14:18.758 --> 14:20.827
- YOU'RE NOT GONNA FOLLOW ME
IN THE BATHROOM, ARE YOU?

14:20.827 --> 14:23.230
- NO.

14:23.230 --> 14:25.165
BUT YOU SHOULD HOLD IT!

14:25.165 --> 14:30.938
BECAUSE I READ IN A BOOK
THAT IT IS GOOD FOR YOU.

14:30.938 --> 14:34.041
HOLDIN' IT RIGHT NOW.
FEELS GOOD.

14:34.041 --> 14:36.209
- OKAY, DID SOMETHING HAPPEN
IN THE ELEVATOR?

14:36.209 --> 14:37.544
'CAUSE YOU'RE ACTING WEIRD.

14:37.544 --> 14:40.780
- NOTHING HAPPENED
IN THE ELEVATOR.

14:40.780 --> 14:43.984
- THEN WAIT HERE.

14:43.984 --> 14:46.186
- BEEN BRAINSTORMING
SOME NEW SONG TITLES.

14:46.186 --> 14:48.155
- UH, UM...

14:48.155 --> 14:49.322
- WHAT DO YOU THINK?

14:49.322 --> 14:51.424
ESCAPE IS FUTILE,

14:51.424 --> 14:52.960
YOU WILL BE MINE,

14:52.960 --> 14:57.297
AND KENDALL DUMPED JO BECAUSE
HE REALIZED HE STILL LIKES ME.

14:57.297 --> 14:58.531
- WHAT'S GOING ON?

14:58.531 --> 15:00.533
- THINK IT'S LOCKED.

15:00.533 --> 15:01.701
HOW ABOUT THE SONG TITLE,

15:01.701 --> 15:03.336
PLEASE GO AWAY
SO I CAN STOP LYING?

15:03.336 --> 15:06.806
- HOW ABOUT BLOW YOU A KISS?

15:12.245 --> 15:14.347
- DID I HEAR LUCY?
- NO.

15:14.347 --> 15:16.283
- ARE YOU LYING TO ME?

15:16.283 --> 15:17.985
[together]
REMEMBER...

15:17.985 --> 15:19.886
- NOT NOW!

15:21.488 --> 15:24.724
AM I LYING TO YOU, OR EVER?

15:24.724 --> 15:29.596
SO WHY DON'T WE JUST GET ON OUT
OF HERE?

15:29.596 --> 15:31.331
YOU SMELL SOMETHING BURNING?

15:31.331 --> 15:33.833
- YEAH, YOUR PANTS
ARE ON FIRE AGAIN.

15:33.833 --> 15:34.867
- [shrieks]

15:34.867 --> 15:37.470
PANTS ON FIRE!
PANTS ON FIRE!

15:37.470 --> 15:38.405
splash!

15:40.007 --> 15:41.341
- I CAN'T ENJOY SNACKS.

15:41.341 --> 15:45.445
BECAUSE OF US, COWBOY PIRATE
NUMBER TWO IS IN JAIL.

15:45.445 --> 15:47.014
- WE CAN FIX THIS.

15:47.014 --> 15:50.817
ALL WE HAVE TO DO IS PROVE THAT
THE STUDIO BANDIT WASN'T HIM.

15:50.817 --> 15:52.785
- OKAY,
BUT THAT MEANS CONFESSING

15:52.785 --> 15:55.655
THAT WE BROKE
ALL OF GUSTAVO'S STUFF.

15:55.655 --> 15:56.789
- [sighs]

15:56.789 --> 15:58.825
- OR...

15:58.825 --> 15:59.926
- WE REALLY HAVE TO DO--

15:59.926 --> 16:01.028
[muffled yelling]

16:01.028 --> 16:03.030
WE WERE ROBBED AGAIN!

16:03.030 --> 16:04.897
- [screams]

16:07.500 --> 16:08.735
- MM-KAY.
I THINK SHE'S ASLEEP.

16:08.735 --> 16:09.936
- WELL, OF COURSE SHE'S ASLEEP.

16:09.936 --> 16:12.339
SHE'S READING BORING
MEDICAL JOURNALS.

16:12.339 --> 16:14.041
THAT'S WHY I NEVER READ THEM.

16:14.041 --> 16:15.042
- WHAT?

16:15.042 --> 16:16.843
OKAY, LET'S GET A SECOND OPINION

16:16.843 --> 16:18.811
AND GET OUT
OF THIS STUPID BUBBLE.

16:18.811 --> 16:21.748
- [grunts]
- [coughing]

16:23.316 --> 16:25.218
- AHEM.

16:25.218 --> 16:26.786
JUST ADMIT YOU'RE LYING,

16:26.786 --> 16:32.159
AND I WON'T BREAK UP WITH YOU
OR REPORT YOU FOR MALPRACTICE.

16:32.159 --> 16:35.062
- LYING?
HOW DARE YOU, MADAME?

16:35.062 --> 16:37.064
- [coughs]
WAIT.

16:37.064 --> 16:38.498
[beeping]

16:38.498 --> 16:39.666
[gasps]

16:39.666 --> 16:41.568
[beeping]

16:41.568 --> 16:43.403
[laughs]

16:43.403 --> 16:44.404
WE HAVE FEVERS!

16:44.404 --> 16:45.638
WE ARE SICK!

16:45.638 --> 16:46.673
- WE AREN'T LYING.

16:46.673 --> 16:48.675
WE HAVE COLDS!

16:48.675 --> 16:49.909
- WHOO!

16:49.909 --> 16:51.478
- FINE.
YOU ARE SICK.

16:51.478 --> 16:53.180
BUT IF YOU DIDN'T WANT
TO GO TO THE PLAY,

16:53.180 --> 16:55.182
YOU SHOULD HAVE JUST SAID SO.

16:55.182 --> 16:56.116
[sighs]

17:00.220 --> 17:04.757
- I CANNOT BE SEEN WEARING MY
MOM'S PANTS.

17:04.757 --> 17:06.459
- SHOULD HAVE THOUGHT OF THAT
BEFORE YOU LIED

17:06.459 --> 17:08.728
AND BURNED ALL YOUR PANTS.

17:08.728 --> 17:10.097
- YOU SURE YOU DON'T WANT US
TO STAY

17:10.097 --> 17:11.231
IN CASE SOMETHING GOES WRONG?

17:11.231 --> 17:12.232
- OH, DON'T WORRY.

17:12.232 --> 17:13.600
YOU'LL APPEAR ON MY SHOULDERS.

17:23.410 --> 17:24.777
UNBELIEVABLE!

17:24.777 --> 17:27.347
- OH, RELAX, HOT PANTS.

17:27.347 --> 17:30.283
I WAS JUST WORKING
ON MY NEXT HIT SONG.

17:30.283 --> 17:33.019
IT'S ABOUT ME...

17:33.019 --> 17:34.721
IN A SLIDE WITH...

17:34.721 --> 17:37.257
MY GUITAR,
AND I'M PLAYING A SONG,

17:37.257 --> 17:38.291
WHEN, ALL OF A SUDDEN--

17:38.291 --> 17:39.759
[knocking]

17:39.759 --> 17:40.827
- THAT'S JO.

17:40.827 --> 17:42.395
QUICK, HIDE IN THE SLIDE.

17:42.395 --> 17:43.396
- I JUST LIKE THAT RHYME.

17:43.396 --> 17:44.397
- JUST HIDE!

17:44.397 --> 17:46.299
HIDE, HIDE!

17:46.299 --> 17:47.800
HIDE, HIDE, HIDE!

17:47.800 --> 17:48.835
HI!

17:48.835 --> 17:49.902
- HI.

17:49.902 --> 17:51.904
LISTEN, I WANTED
TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT...

17:51.904 --> 17:54.841
THOSE PANTS.

17:54.841 --> 17:57.477
- UH, YEAH, SEE,
WHAT HAPPENED WAS--

17:57.477 --> 17:59.779
- IS THAT LUCY'S GUITAR?

17:59.779 --> 18:04.050
- UH, I MEAN, NO, IT IS LOGAN'S.

18:04.050 --> 18:05.485
- THEN WHY DOES IT SAY
LUCY ON IT?

18:05.485 --> 18:08.155
- THAT MEANS GUITAR IN
ICELANDIC.

18:08.155 --> 18:11.958
IT IS ACTUALLY "LOU-KI."

18:11.958 --> 18:13.493
- IT'S JUST ALL DAY LONG,

18:13.493 --> 18:17.029
I'VE HAD THIS FEELING LIKE
LUCY'S COMING BETWEEN US,

18:17.029 --> 18:18.965
AND IT'S JUST SO FRUSTRATING.

18:21.901 --> 18:23.170
- HI, JO.

18:23.170 --> 18:25.472
- UH...

18:25.472 --> 18:26.506
UH!

18:26.506 --> 18:29.842
JO, WAIT!

18:29.842 --> 18:33.580
I KNOW, LYING IS BAD.

18:33.580 --> 18:37.884
- OKAY, I GUESS THIS MEANS
THAT COWBOY PIRATE NUMERAL DOS

18:37.884 --> 18:38.918
IS INNOCENT.

18:38.918 --> 18:40.052
- AND CAN BE SET FREE.

18:40.052 --> 18:42.021
HEY, GREAT WORK, COMMISSIONER.

18:42.021 --> 18:44.090
- I'M NOT SO SURE.

18:44.090 --> 18:47.494
IT'S STARTING
TO LOOK LIKE AN INSIDE JOB.

18:49.962 --> 18:53.333
GUSTAVO ROCQUE,
YOU'RE UNDER ARREST.

18:53.333 --> 18:54.401
- WHAT?
- WHAT?

18:54.401 --> 18:55.635
[together]
WHAT?

18:55.635 --> 18:58.271
- YOUR FINGERPRINTS ARE ALL OVER
BOTH CRIME SCENES.

18:58.271 --> 19:00.006
- HE WORKS HERE, GENIUS.

19:00.006 --> 19:02.309
- UH, YEAH.
WHY WOULD I ROB MY OWN STUDIO?

19:02.309 --> 19:03.810
- ZIP IT, PUNK.

19:03.810 --> 19:05.212
DON'T WORRY, BOYS.

19:05.212 --> 19:08.848
HE'S GOING AWAY
FOR A VERY LONG TIME.

19:08.848 --> 19:09.849
GET HIM OUT OF HERE.

19:09.849 --> 19:11.284
- [shrieks]

19:12.985 --> 19:15.054
- WAIT, IT WAS US!
- WE DID IT!

19:15.054 --> 19:18.325
- WE WERE SODA BOWLING FOR LOVE,
AND A BOTTLE BROKE.

19:18.325 --> 19:19.892
IT EXPLODED,
AND BROKE EVERYTHING.

19:19.892 --> 19:21.228
- AND THEN WE MADE UP THAT STORY

19:21.228 --> 19:22.829
BECAUSE WE DIDN'T WANT TO GET IN
TROUBLE.

19:22.829 --> 19:25.898
AND WE'RE SORRY.
JUST TAKE US.

19:25.898 --> 19:28.335
- AND THAT'S HOW
YOU GET A CONFESSION.

19:28.335 --> 19:29.369
- WHAT?
- HUH?

19:29.369 --> 19:31.238
[laughter]

19:31.238 --> 19:32.372
- WHOA.
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.

19:32.372 --> 19:34.040
YOU KNEW IT WAS THESE TWO
THE ENTIRE TIME?

19:34.040 --> 19:35.342
- YEAH.

19:35.342 --> 19:37.410
JUST WANTED TO SEE HOW FAR
THEY WOULD TAKE IT.

19:37.410 --> 19:39.246
AND YOU TWO DID NOT DISAPPOINT.

19:39.246 --> 19:41.514
[laughter]

19:41.514 --> 19:42.582
- WAIT, WAIT.

19:42.582 --> 19:44.417
YOU HAD NOTHING BETTER TO DO

19:44.417 --> 19:46.286
BUT FAKE THIS WHOLE
INVESTIGATION?

19:46.286 --> 19:48.655
- TO TEACH US A LESSON
ABOUT LYING?

19:48.655 --> 19:49.989
- WELL, IT WAS A SLOW WEEK.

19:52.525 --> 19:55.262
- JO!
PLEASE WAIT!

19:55.262 --> 19:58.164
I CANNOT RUN IN THESE PANTS.

19:58.164 --> 19:59.999
- YOU LIED TO ME.

19:59.999 --> 20:01.000
- YES.

20:01.000 --> 20:02.735
I LIED.

20:02.735 --> 20:04.571
LUCY TRIED TO KISS ME
IN THE ELEVATOR,

20:04.571 --> 20:07.774
AND I DIDN'T TELL YOU BECAUSE...

20:07.774 --> 20:10.277
I THOUGHT YOU MIGHT GET UPSET.

20:10.277 --> 20:11.944
I WAS AFRAID
WE MIGHT BREAK UP AGAIN.

20:14.747 --> 20:16.916
- WELL, I LIED TOO.

20:16.916 --> 20:18.951
I DID CARE THAT LUCY WAS BACK.

20:18.951 --> 20:23.089
I MEAN, SHE'S SO PRETTY
AND TALENTED AND...

20:23.089 --> 20:25.458
I WAS AFRAID
THAT I MIGHT LOSE YOU TOO.

20:25.458 --> 20:27.394
- THAT WILL NEVER HAPPEN.

20:27.394 --> 20:31.531
AND I PROMISE TO NEVER LIE
AGAIN.

20:31.531 --> 20:32.932
- ME TOO.

20:32.932 --> 20:33.933
- ME TOO.

20:33.933 --> 20:35.268
- UGH!

20:35.268 --> 20:36.836
- SHE IS REALLY GOOD AT THAT.

20:36.836 --> 20:39.205
- AND I AM SO SORRY.

20:39.205 --> 20:40.407
I DON'T WANT KENDALL BACK.

20:40.407 --> 20:42.742
I WAS JUST TRYING
TO CREATE DRAMA

20:42.742 --> 20:45.812
TO HELP ME WRITE SOME NEW SONGS
FOR MY ALBUM.

20:45.812 --> 20:47.179
WHEN KENDALL PICKED YOU OVER ME,

20:47.179 --> 20:49.382
I WROTE SOME OF THE BEST SONGS
OF MY LIFE.

20:49.382 --> 20:50.783
BUT NOW THAT I'M OVER IT,

20:50.783 --> 20:53.320
I CAN'T WRITE A GOOD SONG
TO SAVE MY LIFE.

20:53.320 --> 20:56.289
- WELL, HE IS GOOD
FOR INSPIRATION.

20:56.289 --> 20:58.358
LIKE, THE NEXT TIME
I HAVE TO LAUGH ON SET,

20:58.358 --> 20:59.792
I'M GONNA THINK OF THOSE PANTS.

20:59.792 --> 21:01.394
- HUH?
- [giggles]

21:01.394 --> 21:03.330
MAYBE I CAN WRITE
A SONG ABOUT THAT.

21:03.330 --> 21:04.597
- YEAH.

21:04.597 --> 21:06.366
- WHAT RHYMES WITH "MOM PANTS?"

21:06.366 --> 21:08.335
- HOW ABOUT "SO WRONG PANTS?"

21:08.335 --> 21:10.370
- YOU GUYS SHOULD STOP
BEING FRIENDS NOW.

21:10.370 --> 21:12.238
- LET'S WRITE SO MANY.

21:12.238 --> 21:14.240
- WELL, I GUESS WE SURE
LEARNED OUR LESSON.

21:14.240 --> 21:15.241
- YUP.

21:15.241 --> 21:17.744
HONESTY IS THE BEST POLICY.

21:17.744 --> 21:20.780
- OH, NOT YOU GUYS TOO.

21:20.780 --> 21:21.881
- HUH.

21:21.881 --> 21:22.949
WHAT'S HIS PROBLEM?

21:22.949 --> 21:24.116
- I DON'T KNOW.

21:24.116 --> 21:26.118
PROBABLY THOSE PANTS.

21:26.118 --> 21:28.054
- * OH-OH, OH-OH

21:31.190 --> 21:32.692
- YOU GUYS WERE RIGHT.

21:32.692 --> 21:33.826
THIS IS AWFUL.

21:33.826 --> 21:34.827
- ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

21:34.827 --> 21:36.228
THIS IS ACTUALLY REALLY GOOD.

21:36.228 --> 21:37.229
- IT'S AMAZING.

21:37.229 --> 21:38.931
AND THERE'S THREE HOURS LEFT.

21:38.931 --> 21:41.100
- [coughing]

21:41.100 --> 21:43.035
I THINK I'M GETTING SICK.

21:43.035 --> 21:45.171
LET'S GO.

21:45.171 --> 21:47.106
- WELL, FEEL BETTER, OKAY?

21:49.509 --> 21:52.945
- LET ME KNOW HOW IT ENDS.

21:52.945 --> 21:53.946
- HOW DO THEY DO THAT?

21:53.946 --> 21:54.881
- AND LOOK
AT THE HEART BOUNCING.

21:57.517 --> 21:58.518
- * STEP IT UP,

21:58.518 --> 22:00.186
* GO FOR BROKE,

22:11.431 --> 22:12.532
- * OH-OH, OH-OH
