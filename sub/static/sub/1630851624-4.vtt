sweatshirt doesn't count

12:01.304 --> 12:03.390

- Dude,

to be the smart one.

12:05.475 --> 12:07.602

12:07.686 --> 12:10.147
Okay, that sweatshirt
wasn't a love letter.

12:10.230 --> 12:11.398
- It was a fucking threat.
- If she wanted

12:11.481 --> 12:13.608
to kill me, she could've
done it already.

12:15.485 --> 12:17.279

to tell me something.

Dale and-and fucking Coach.
