WEBVTT

00:03.297 --> 00:05.273
Now remember. You can't tell your
teacher that all we had for breakfast

00:05.298 --> 00:06.672
was cookies and chocolate milk.

00:07.215 --> 00:09.215
Though, I suspect she'll
figure it out soon enough.

00:10.603 --> 00:12.854
Oh, hey guys. How's it
going? How is everybody?

00:12.867 --> 00:15.507
Did you press the button? God, Ben,
why didn't you press the button?

00:16.250 --> 00:17.870
Apparently we're not the
only ones who started our day

00:17.872 --> 00:19.461
with a half-pound of sugar.

00:19.807 --> 00:21.874
I'm sorry. Sorry, Danny's
been reading this baby book

00:21.876 --> 00:24.461
our doctor recommended,
and it's become his bible.

00:24.486 --> 00:26.565
I'm just trying to get out of here
before he gives me any more advice.

00:26.590 --> 00:29.574
He's suddenly monitoring every moment
of my day for the good of the baby.

00:29.876 --> 00:31.996
I'm sorry, I'm still back
at "Danny's reading a book."

00:33.360 --> 00:35.281
You know what? I'm just
going to take the stairs.

00:36.057 --> 00:38.624
- Sweetie, hi!
- Oh hey, ha!

00:38.659 --> 00:40.493
I just ran down to grab you a cab

00:40.545 --> 00:42.170
because you shouldn't be
waiting outside on the curb.

00:42.195 --> 00:43.506
Oh, you know what? I can actually walk.

00:43.531 --> 00:44.718
No, no, but you shouldn't!

00:44.743 --> 00:47.677
According to my book, you're making a
spinal cord and fingertips this week.

00:47.702 --> 00:51.007
Ha ha! I mean, I could never do that.

00:51.939 --> 00:54.874
Oh, you don't have to...
Oh, we're doing this.

00:54.876 --> 00:57.414
Oh, sorry, bro. You
mind taking the next one?

00:57.439 --> 00:59.347
Trying to minimize germ exposure.

01:02.192 --> 01:04.242
It's gotta be an audio book, right?

01:05.686 --> 01:07.453
Man, now we're really late.

01:07.455 --> 01:08.455
Rocket ship.

01:08.506 --> 01:09.555
Ooh, perfect!

01:09.590 --> 01:11.557
Rocket ship Emma is ready for takeoff.

01:13.000 --> 01:19.074

01:26.228 --> 01:29.890
Wowza, that was one
hell of a conjugal visit.

01:30.481 --> 01:33.382
Tell the warden I want a
copy of the security tape.

01:34.031 --> 01:36.031
Oh, Bon-bon,

01:36.159 --> 01:39.160
I'm just so glad I can spend these
brief fleeting moments with you.

01:39.587 --> 01:42.621
Prison can be such a terrifying place.

01:42.623 --> 01:44.957
I think one of
the guards has it out for me.

01:44.959 --> 01:47.304
Oh my God! Is he roughing you up?

01:47.329 --> 01:48.179
Worse!

01:48.204 --> 01:49.734
He's refuses to let me
audition for the prison's

01:49.759 --> 01:51.392
upcoming production of Guys and Dolls,

01:51.417 --> 01:53.336
and I know I would be perfect for it!

01:55.636 --> 01:57.603
You have to pee in front of that guy,

01:57.638 --> 01:59.429
and that's your biggest problem?

02:01.192 --> 02:02.752
I just gotta get out of here.

02:02.777 --> 02:05.528
I can't believe the DA is
letting me rot away in here

02:05.563 --> 02:08.531
while Bustamonte, the real
mastermind of the whole scheme,

02:08.566 --> 02:10.616
is out there breathing
the fresh scent of freedom.

02:10.651 --> 02:13.062
Wait. Luis Bustamonte?

02:13.087 --> 02:15.382
My boss, Luis Bustamonte,

02:15.407 --> 02:16.934
he's the one who put you up to this?

02:16.958 --> 02:20.659
Yes! He also made me try
paella for the first time.

02:20.661 --> 02:22.578
I loved it...

02:22.603 --> 02:24.976
and so I trusted him.

02:26.501 --> 02:29.502
Okay, but you know, if you can
prove he's the one behind it,

02:29.554 --> 02:31.504
then maybe you can
get some kind of deal.

02:31.556 --> 02:33.343
Brad, you have to say something.

02:33.368 --> 02:34.924
I've tried. I'm willing to sing,

02:34.976 --> 02:36.834
but nobody wants to listen.

02:36.859 --> 02:39.273
Seriously, I do a spot on Adelaide.

02:39.298 --> 02:41.381
They've just gotta let me audition.

02:41.649 --> 02:43.736
Listen, don't you worry, sweetie, okay?

02:43.761 --> 02:46.382
We are going to get you out
of this horrible situation.

02:46.571 --> 02:47.820
Thank you.

02:48.013 --> 02:50.914
I'm even willing to play Sky Masterson.

02:52.338 --> 02:53.736
Prison, Brad.

02:53.761 --> 02:55.961
We're going to get you out of prison.

02:59.299 --> 03:01.882
Oh, hey, I didn't expect you to be here.

03:02.770 --> 03:04.703
You know those cookies
are expired, right?

03:04.996 --> 03:06.796
Sadly, I did know that.

03:07.775 --> 03:10.493
Sorry, it's just Danny only
lets me eat healthy food now.

03:10.518 --> 03:13.586
I was this close to biting
into a vanilla-scented candle.

03:15.399 --> 03:17.749
So, uh, what's with all the work?

03:17.774 --> 03:20.375
It just keeps piling up ever
since I got that promotion.

03:20.400 --> 03:22.300
Promotion? When did you get a promotion?

03:22.325 --> 03:23.783
Oh, a few weeks ago.

03:23.808 --> 03:25.824
I guess I forgot to tell you.
Life has been a little crazy.

03:25.826 --> 03:28.345
Ah, life. She kicks you when you're down

03:28.370 --> 03:30.136
and downs you when you're kicking.

03:31.424 --> 03:33.491
There's meaning in there somewhere.

03:33.784 --> 03:35.528
Well, congrats on the promotion, though.

03:35.553 --> 03:37.453
Is there anything else
you're not telling me?

03:37.478 --> 03:38.631
Ah, let's see...

03:38.656 --> 03:39.705
I'm at war with my mother,

03:39.740 --> 03:41.557
I hate everyone I work with,

03:41.592 --> 03:42.636
and my body does disgusting things

03:42.660 --> 03:44.560
whenever I sneeze, laugh or cough.

03:44.595 --> 03:46.090
That's pretty much it.

03:46.115 --> 03:47.653
Hey, what do you say we go for dinner

03:47.677 --> 03:49.057
tomorrow night and have
a proper catch-up?

03:49.082 --> 03:50.549
Oh, Ben, I'd love to, but I...

03:50.585 --> 03:52.818
Riley, friendship is like a plant.

03:52.870 --> 03:54.753
If you don't nurture it, it dies.

03:54.805 --> 03:56.889
Case in point, all of my plants.

03:56.941 --> 03:58.824
Oh, here you are.

03:58.859 --> 04:01.057
I got everything we need
for an amazing dinner.

04:01.082 --> 04:02.828
All green super foods
which are essential

04:02.863 --> 04:05.348
for building proper brain function.

04:05.373 --> 04:07.616
Our kid is going to be a genius.

04:07.668 --> 04:10.895
Yeah, Danny. I'm sure all
you needed was more kale.

04:11.286 --> 04:13.886
Well, I'm pretty sure you're not
the authority for healthy baby foods,

04:13.911 --> 04:15.957
Mr. Cookies-for-Breakfast.

04:16.349 --> 04:18.200
I thought we had a deal.

04:18.896 --> 04:21.447
Okay, let's go. Um, so, tomorrow night?

04:21.449 --> 04:23.442
- Tomorrow night.
- What's tomorrow night?

04:23.467 --> 04:25.621
It's the day after today.

04:25.646 --> 04:27.825
Oh, cool, thanks, babe.

04:31.809 --> 04:33.809
It's normal for friends to grow apart.

04:34.012 --> 04:36.762
- We'll never grow apart, will we?
- We'll see.

04:45.293 --> 04:46.472
Riley!

04:46.524 --> 04:48.524
My God, Mrs. Wheeler.
What are you doing here?

04:48.576 --> 04:49.625
Okay, look.

04:49.677 --> 04:52.174
I know how we can finally
get Brad out of prison.

04:52.199 --> 04:53.912
It turns out that my boss, Luis,

04:53.948 --> 04:55.864
was behind the entire thing.

04:55.900 --> 04:57.629
And we are not gonna to rest

04:57.654 --> 04:59.868
until we catch Luis and free Brad.

05:00.129 --> 05:01.687
All right, I'll be at my apartment.

05:01.722 --> 05:03.656
Call me when you have something.

05:03.691 --> 05:04.673
Luis?

05:04.709 --> 05:06.587
He was the first person
the police investigated.

05:06.611 --> 05:07.754
The DA concluded he was clean.

05:07.778 --> 05:09.662
The DA is in on it too.

05:09.714 --> 05:11.597
This goes all the way up to the top.

05:11.599 --> 05:13.660
God, Riley, haven't
you ever seen a movie?

05:15.603 --> 05:18.537
Mrs. Wheeler, I'm sorry, but unless
you have a confession from him,

05:18.539 --> 05:19.616
the court made their decision.

05:19.640 --> 05:21.090
I mean, my hands are tied.

05:21.115 --> 05:22.508
- Riley?
- Um...

05:22.543 --> 05:24.082
I'm just taking out the trash.

05:25.496 --> 05:28.340
Oh, hey, Tucker. I need your help.

05:28.372 --> 05:30.043
Does it involve assisted
suicide or trying

05:30.067 --> 05:31.785
to smuggle you out of the country?

05:32.238 --> 05:35.317
No... not this time.

05:35.582 --> 05:37.280
Look, I just found out that my boss

05:37.305 --> 05:39.449
is the reason Brad is in prison.

05:39.474 --> 05:41.309
I need to get a confession out of him.

05:41.334 --> 05:42.695
Wait, wait, let me guess. You're a...

05:42.697 --> 05:45.192
you're gonna do a
little boob-boob-seduce?

05:47.527 --> 05:49.645
Also known as your answer to everything.

05:49.670 --> 05:52.438
God, you are so predictable.

05:53.194 --> 05:54.387
Ow!

05:55.340 --> 05:57.199
I bet you didn't predict that.

05:57.928 --> 06:00.429
Come on, this is serious.

06:00.481 --> 06:03.207
I have some spy equipment
we could use to record him.

06:03.232 --> 06:04.223
- Really?
- Yeah.

06:04.248 --> 06:05.734
That'll be perfect.

06:05.786 --> 06:07.786
Wait. Why do you have spy equipment?

06:07.822 --> 06:10.449
I'll tell you if you tell me
why that guy comes to your house

06:10.474 --> 06:12.012
every night at eight o'clock.

06:13.644 --> 06:16.074
- And we've reached a stalemate.
- Mmm.

06:19.583 --> 06:21.035
Well, it has been
really, really great...

06:21.060 --> 06:23.254
catching up with the two of you.

06:23.402 --> 06:25.736
I had no idea of the
prenatal benefits of cacao.

06:26.030 --> 06:28.496
Although I do really like saying, cacao.

06:29.877 --> 06:31.301
Oh, I got it.

06:31.529 --> 06:33.879
- He really wanted to come.
- I want a do-over.

06:33.914 --> 06:35.551
Here you go.

06:35.576 --> 06:37.816
And, dude, that baby
book is really helpful.

06:37.852 --> 06:39.449
You should totally borrow it sometime.

06:39.474 --> 06:41.687
It might help you be a
little more responsible.

06:41.739 --> 06:43.822
Danny, you don't learn
about parenting from a book.

06:43.858 --> 06:45.674
Well, mom had a whole shelf of them.

06:45.726 --> 06:46.726
Point made.

06:49.309 --> 06:50.473
You got your cover story down?

06:50.498 --> 06:52.792
Yep, yep. I'm gonna tell
him that I was propositioned

06:52.817 --> 06:54.466
by a client for some shady deal

06:54.518 --> 06:55.558
that's technically illegal

06:55.603 --> 06:56.902
but would make us a fortune.

06:56.904 --> 06:58.854
I'll earn Luis's trust,

06:58.889 --> 07:01.948
he'll spill about his involvement
with Brad, and if all goes well,

07:01.973 --> 07:04.710
I won't even have to take my shirt off.

07:04.762 --> 07:06.779
You better not or
you'll loosen the wire.

07:06.781 --> 07:08.714
At least let me check the volume.

07:10.735 --> 07:11.735
What the hell was that?

07:11.786 --> 07:13.635
Wires must be a little frayed.

07:13.671 --> 07:16.606
I've had this stuff in my
drawer since my 11th birthday.

07:16.631 --> 07:19.608
Oh, son of a crap-burger.

07:19.643 --> 07:21.026
What the hell, stop that!

07:21.078 --> 07:23.657
Okay, God. I just won't touch the
volume button and we should be good.

07:23.681 --> 07:24.646
Yeah! Don't.

07:24.682 --> 07:26.074
Okay.

07:27.668 --> 07:28.948
Ahh!

07:30.007 --> 07:31.573
My bad, last time, I promise.

07:34.825 --> 07:36.192
Hello, Luis.

07:36.527 --> 07:37.760
Bonnie!

07:37.795 --> 07:39.878
I'm so glad you suggested
we meet for a drink.

07:39.914 --> 07:42.748
It's nice to get out of
the office once in a while.

07:42.750 --> 07:45.818
Well, I actually just
needed a little advice.

07:45.853 --> 07:47.753
See I was talking to this client...

07:47.788 --> 07:49.688
Aah!

07:49.723 --> 07:50.773
- Are you okay?
- Mm-hmm.

07:50.808 --> 07:53.675
I'm fine. Totally fine.

07:53.711 --> 07:55.611
... who proposed this investment,

07:55.646 --> 07:58.464
that while extremely lucrative,

07:58.516 --> 07:59.615
could be slightly...

07:59.650 --> 08:02.468
... illegal.

08:04.238 --> 08:06.789
So, um, what would you do

08:06.841 --> 08:09.049
or might have done in such a situation?

08:09.074 --> 08:10.793
And please, speak clearly,

08:10.828 --> 08:13.729
and try to enunciate every word.

08:13.764 --> 08:16.096
Ah, Bonnie, you were
smart to come to me.

08:16.121 --> 08:17.850
When it comes to "creative
real estate financing,"

08:17.885 --> 08:19.785
I wrote the book. Seriously,

08:19.787 --> 08:21.073
I'll give you an autographed copy.

08:21.098 --> 08:22.638
Aah!

08:22.690 --> 08:24.490
- Need help?
- No, I'm all right.

08:24.542 --> 08:25.557
So go on, you were...

08:25.593 --> 08:27.609
... saying. Ahh!

08:29.480 --> 08:31.463
Um, you know what, Luis, I'm gonna...

08:31.465 --> 08:33.482
Excuse me for just one
second. I was just gonna...

08:36.886 --> 08:38.504
Aah! Ha.

08:38.539 --> 08:40.806
Okay, ah!

08:40.841 --> 08:44.743
I'm serious, girl. You make bacon
mad 'cause you're so sizzlin'.

08:44.795 --> 08:47.646
Tucker, what the hell?

08:47.698 --> 08:48.714
Hey. How'd it go?

08:48.749 --> 08:50.682
Oh, I'll show you how it went, okay?

08:50.684 --> 08:52.768
Ahh!

09:02.074 --> 09:03.595
Riley, wait.

09:03.597 --> 09:06.498
I am a grown woman, I can
take the stairs if I want to.

09:06.725 --> 09:09.693
What? No, you, my friend,
are not going to work today

09:09.718 --> 09:11.855
because I am kidnapping you.

09:12.423 --> 09:14.192
Yeah, I don't think so.

09:14.758 --> 09:17.206
Really? 'Cause your boss said
to take all the time you need.

09:17.231 --> 09:19.595
"Hey, this is Riley's  
fiancé Danny Wheeler.

09:19.630 --> 09:21.918
"She's super sick and
can't do the law today."

09:22.783 --> 09:24.465
You and I are going hiking.

09:24.490 --> 09:26.668
Nature is the best way
for friends to bond.

09:26.704 --> 09:28.687
Well, so is sex, but
we already did that.

09:30.591 --> 09:31.623
What about Danny?

09:31.659 --> 09:33.324
I won't tell him if you won't.

09:33.544 --> 09:34.877
Look, I miss you.

09:34.912 --> 09:36.285
I miss us.

09:36.310 --> 09:38.530
Riley, friendship is like a car.

09:38.532 --> 09:40.782
I thought you said it was like a plant?

09:40.818 --> 09:43.752
You know, it needs water,
gas, whatever, okay?

09:45.176 --> 09:46.438
Oh, I don't know.

09:46.440 --> 09:48.707
I pre-packed you some shoes, clothes,

09:48.709 --> 09:50.285
sunscreen and way too much jerky.

09:50.310 --> 09:53.077
If it's got four legs,
I've got its jerky.

09:53.847 --> 09:56.176
Come on, what do you say?

09:56.201 --> 09:58.581
I'd say you're pretty amazing.

09:58.606 --> 10:01.113
So, did you actually
see him read the book?

10:06.168 --> 10:08.460
We're all going hiking today.

10:13.926 --> 10:15.651
See? What did I tell you?

10:15.676 --> 10:18.195
Only an hour out of the city
and we're already back to nature.

10:18.247 --> 10:20.881
Honestly, this is exactly what I needed.

10:20.883 --> 10:23.211
Oh my God, did I tell you about
this girl Rhonda from my office?

10:23.235 --> 10:25.119
- Is she hot?
- Not really.

10:25.154 --> 10:26.090
I'm out.

10:26.115 --> 10:29.099
But she has two vagina’s.

10:29.191 --> 10:30.895
And I'm back in.

10:37.049 --> 10:38.363
Hey!

10:38.388 --> 10:40.078
What do you think you're doing?

10:40.102 --> 10:41.985
Oh, no, it's okay.

10:42.021 --> 10:44.004
See, I'm just following
my fiancée and my brother

10:44.040 --> 10:45.067
to make sure nothing happens.

10:45.091 --> 10:47.374
No, no, not like that.

10:47.410 --> 10:49.009
Although it has in the past.

10:49.821 --> 10:51.742
But he's just kind of
a screw up, you know?

10:51.767 --> 10:54.802
See, I'm the good son.
It's a whole siblings' dynamic thing.

10:54.837 --> 10:58.235
And I'm guessing you're
also the stupid son 'cause...

10:58.260 --> 11:00.558
you're standing in a
patch of poison ivy.

11:04.714 --> 11:07.103
I'm sorry, I didn't get the confession.

11:07.128 --> 11:09.095
We had a slight technical problem.

11:09.120 --> 11:10.806
Technical problem?

11:10.831 --> 11:13.267
Whatever happened to
the old boob-boob-seduce?

11:14.251 --> 11:15.556
I wanted to...

11:15.558 --> 11:18.126
but Double-O-Dumb-Dumb
decided we should use his

11:18.151 --> 11:20.056
janky-ass spy gear instead.

11:20.081 --> 11:21.923
But, you know, until I
can get you out of here,

11:21.948 --> 11:23.442
I smuggled you in something.

11:23.466 --> 11:25.349
Is it pomade?

11:25.384 --> 11:27.701
I could really use a
hit of the good stuff.

11:27.737 --> 11:30.377
I've been making my own out of
mayonnaise packets and Jell-O powder.

11:30.406 --> 11:32.723
Do not smell my hair.

11:32.758 --> 11:35.408
No, no.

11:35.433 --> 11:36.754
It's a phone.

11:36.779 --> 11:38.712
Now we can video chat.

11:38.748 --> 11:41.515
Yes!

11:41.567 --> 11:43.150
But can we do it after
ten in the morning?

11:43.175 --> 11:45.704
I lead a sunrise yoga
class for cell block C.

11:46.363 --> 11:48.162
I'll make a note of that.

11:48.829 --> 11:51.048
And, honey, I know that
you'll think of something

11:51.073 --> 11:52.884
to nail that rat bastard, Luis.

11:53.079 --> 11:55.007
It's just ironic how hard
it is to get a confession

11:55.032 --> 11:57.212
out of a guy who confesses all the time.

11:57.237 --> 11:59.040
Wait, what are you talking about?

11:59.080 --> 12:00.980
Oh, Luis is an extremely
devout Catholic.

12:01.015 --> 12:02.970
He goes to church like every day.

12:03.368 --> 12:04.967
Hey, can we come back in a month?

12:05.019 --> 12:07.403
They're doing a prison
production of Guys and Dolls.

12:08.980 --> 12:10.030
Tucker...

12:10.120 --> 12:12.822
do you consider
yourself a religious man?

12:15.346 --> 12:17.296
Oh, man.

12:17.332 --> 12:19.282
This really brings me back.

12:19.317 --> 12:20.814
Did you go to Catholic school?

12:20.839 --> 12:23.807
Sure. Let's go with that.

12:25.239 --> 12:28.074
Forgive me,
Father, for I have sinned.

12:29.477 --> 12:32.445
Yes, my child. Tell me about your sins.

12:32.497 --> 12:34.380
With as much detail as possible.

12:34.432 --> 12:36.837
Well, I'm guilty of stealing.

12:37.783 --> 12:40.386
I took a co-worker's yogurt from
the fridge without telling him.

12:44.150 --> 12:47.243
You know what, God is fine
with office shenanigans.

12:47.245 --> 12:49.295
Now, uh, let's get to the big picture.

12:49.330 --> 12:53.282
And remember, the Lord,
he likes dates and times.

12:53.284 --> 12:56.252
Honestly, there's nothing I
have not already confessed before.

12:57.271 --> 12:59.121
Ah...

12:59.123 --> 13:01.300
You know what? You probably
confessed with Gary.

13:01.731 --> 13:03.080
He got fired.

13:03.461 --> 13:06.395
Something about him, a nun,
and a rabbi walk into a bar.

13:09.862 --> 13:12.129
Forgive me father, for I have sinned.

13:12.154 --> 13:14.949
The voices are telling
me to do bad things again.

13:16.007 --> 13:17.423
Luis?

13:17.475 --> 13:20.276
No, it's Timothy.

13:22.182 --> 13:24.802
You know, just say the Lord's
Prayer and a few Bloody Marys,

13:24.827 --> 13:26.593
you should be good, man.

13:29.981 --> 13:31.425
Just as I thought...

13:31.457 --> 13:33.042
we're lost.

13:33.604 --> 13:36.453
"Let's leave our cell phones at 
home so nobody bugs us."

13:36.477 --> 13:38.127
Brilliant plan, Ben.

13:38.179 --> 13:40.424
Yeah, well, joke's on you
because I didn't even have a plan.

13:40.448 --> 13:41.831
Well, maybe you should've.

13:41.856 --> 13:43.970
I mean, taking a pregnant
woman hiking without a map

13:43.995 --> 13:45.993
or enough food is
completely irresponsible.

13:46.018 --> 13:48.304
- Hey, we have a ton of food.
- Not anymore.

13:48.306 --> 13:50.019
I brought like ten pounds of jerky.

13:50.044 --> 13:52.861
Yeah, well, I brought
like 20 pounds of baby.

13:56.330 --> 13:58.080
Whoa!

14:00.008 --> 14:01.007
What was that?

14:01.041 --> 14:02.006
Was that a bear?

14:02.031 --> 14:03.114
Oh my God, run!

14:12.253 --> 14:13.612
Here you go!

14:13.614 --> 14:15.047
Would an irresponsible person

14:15.082 --> 14:17.883
forage you a delicious meal of
hand-picked nuts and wild berries?

14:18.409 --> 14:21.145
Um, those are rocks, and
your berries are moving.

14:27.702 --> 14:29.182
Are you sure this is going to work?

14:29.207 --> 14:32.225
Don't worry. These babies
get great reception.

14:32.733 --> 14:35.617
Not the first time I've
been here before, am I right?

14:35.670 --> 14:38.537
Oh, honey, you love Boob Canyon.

14:38.589 --> 14:40.522
Ooh! Incoming.

14:41.417 --> 14:43.575
Mom. Mom, I need your help.

14:43.577 --> 14:45.561
Wait, Tuck, why do you
have my mom's phone?

14:45.596 --> 14:47.997
I'm taping her phone to
her chest to entrap someone.

14:48.032 --> 14:49.915
Ah, been there.

14:49.967 --> 14:51.900
But I really need your help!

14:51.936 --> 14:53.786
I'm lost in the woods,
I can't find Riley.

14:53.838 --> 14:56.839
I think I have poison ivy and I
twisted my ankle falling out of a tree.

14:57.143 --> 15:00.809
Well, I'm staring into
your mom's chest, so I win.

15:00.845 --> 15:03.629
Bye sweetie, Mommy loves you.
Don't get eaten by a bear.

15:03.664 --> 15:04.713
Bye-bye now.

15:04.749 --> 15:06.598
All right.

15:06.600 --> 15:08.534
He's here, he's here. All right.

15:08.586 --> 15:10.586
Time to catch your boss with your boobs

15:10.621 --> 15:11.916
to get your husband out of prison.

15:12.998 --> 15:14.864
Where did you go wrong, Bonnie?

15:18.646 --> 15:20.963
Luis, what a surprise.

15:21.153 --> 15:22.719
You told me to meet you here at 7:00.

15:23.918 --> 15:26.802
Yeah, well, I was hoping we
could get to know each other

15:26.854 --> 15:28.821
a little better outside of the office.

15:28.873 --> 15:29.873
Ah...

15:29.924 --> 15:32.875
A rose blooms through
the concrete of the city.

15:33.018 --> 15:34.727
These are for you.

15:34.762 --> 15:37.914
Oh, Luis, you shouldn't have.

15:37.939 --> 15:39.772
Again, you told me to.

15:44.739 --> 15:46.705
Where did you learn how to do that?

15:46.741 --> 15:48.640
Started a lot of fires in my day.

15:48.676 --> 15:49.658
That's how I got my nickname.

15:49.715 --> 15:51.939
That boy who started a lot of fires.

15:53.384 --> 15:54.980
Hey, look...

15:55.015 --> 15:56.582
I'm really sorry about all of this.

15:56.584 --> 15:58.951
I just wanted to spend
some time with you.

15:59.095 --> 16:01.920
No, I was the guy you used
to come to with your problems.

16:01.972 --> 16:03.889
The guy you could
talk to about anything.

16:03.924 --> 16:06.759
You know, that's cool,
things change. I get it.

16:07.862 --> 16:09.745
Ben, I'm scared.

16:09.780 --> 16:10.829
Don't worry, someone will find us.

16:10.831 --> 16:12.804
No, not about this...

16:13.369 --> 16:14.535
about this.

16:15.304 --> 16:18.654
About being a mom. I
don't know if I can do it.

16:18.689 --> 16:21.707
I mean, I know Danny's going
to be an amazing father.

16:21.709 --> 16:23.559
He's set the bar so high,

16:23.594 --> 16:25.594
I'm terrified of disappointing him.

16:25.629 --> 16:28.514
I mean, he wants everything
to be perfect, and...

16:28.516 --> 16:30.616
I don't know if I can be perfect.

16:30.668 --> 16:33.552
I just, I really don't
want to screw this up.

16:33.554 --> 16:35.954
Wait, so you're saying you're
worried about disappointing Danny

16:35.956 --> 16:38.323
and I'm the only one
you can talk to about it?

16:38.793 --> 16:40.826
Yes!

16:42.120 --> 16:44.863
Riley, there's no such
thing as a perfect parent.

16:44.865 --> 16:47.666
And yes, having a kid is terrifying.

16:47.668 --> 16:50.702
You constantly worry whether or
not you've made the right choices.

16:50.754 --> 16:52.588
But all that worrying,

16:52.623 --> 16:53.639
and self-doubt...

16:53.691 --> 16:55.651
that's what's going to
make you an amazing mother.

16:56.694 --> 16:59.528
And I can already tell,
you're going to be incredible.

17:01.966 --> 17:03.599
Thank you, Ben.

17:03.634 --> 17:05.867
See, this is why I always need you.

17:05.920 --> 17:06.920
Hey!

17:06.971 --> 17:08.503
What are you doin'?

17:08.556 --> 17:09.887
You can't build a fire there.

17:09.940 --> 17:11.183
Oh my God, we're saved!

17:11.208 --> 17:12.840
We have been lost out here for hours.

17:12.877 --> 17:15.637
No food or water. I
literally almost ate a frog.

17:16.512 --> 17:19.113
Well, too bad you didn't
walk another 25 feet,

17:19.137 --> 17:21.817
'cause you would've run
into the parking lot.

17:24.755 --> 17:26.669
Oh yeah, it's right through there.

17:28.809 --> 17:29.942
Let's be honest,

17:29.977 --> 17:32.694
there's no way he could pull
off that scam all on his own.

17:32.730 --> 17:33.974
Really?

17:33.999 --> 17:35.692
You think someone else was involved.

17:35.716 --> 17:37.138
Come on!

17:37.163 --> 17:39.985
Brad's most impressive
organ isn't his brain.

17:40.020 --> 17:41.537
Mmm.

17:41.589 --> 17:44.523
Oh, but the genius who
pulled off that scam, now...

17:44.558 --> 17:47.876
that's the guy that I
would like to meet. Hmm.

17:47.912 --> 17:49.928
- You would?
- Oh yeah!

17:49.964 --> 17:53.339
And if he was Latin, oh boy,

17:53.364 --> 17:56.001
I would show him my tierra Del fuego.

17:56.669 --> 17:59.441
Oh! It's me! It's me, Bonnie.

17:59.466 --> 18:02.218
I am the genius you speak of!
I did it, I did it, I did it!

18:02.243 --> 18:03.709
- Really?
- Really.

18:03.711 --> 18:05.694
So you're saying that
you were the mastermind

18:05.729 --> 18:07.335
behind the entire real estate scam,

18:07.360 --> 18:09.430
and that Brad was just a mere pawn?

18:09.455 --> 18:11.633
I am. Though I do honestly wish

18:11.685 --> 18:14.570
Brad was here so I could
explain to him how sorry I am.

18:14.622 --> 18:16.705
Well, then you're in luck...

18:16.891 --> 18:19.608
- Aha!
- Aha!

18:19.660 --> 18:21.527
Caught you, you rat bastard!

18:21.562 --> 18:24.165
Brad! What are you
doing in Bonnie's bosom?

18:24.782 --> 18:27.933
We concocted this whole scheme
to get your confession...

18:27.968 --> 18:29.635
and you took the bait.

18:29.670 --> 18:31.603
How could you, Luis? I trusted you.

18:31.605 --> 18:33.071
But you have to believe me...

18:33.107 --> 18:35.535
I only turned you in because I
thought you were going to turn me in.

18:35.559 --> 18:36.892
I would never do such a thing.

18:37.059 --> 18:38.860
Please, forgive me, Brad.

18:39.037 --> 18:40.037
I can't...

18:41.504 --> 18:42.848
because I already have.

18:42.850 --> 18:43.950
Oh!

18:44.785 --> 18:46.752
Oh, Brad.

18:46.804 --> 18:48.670
Okay, all right, you
know what, get off of me!

18:48.722 --> 18:49.722
Okay.

18:49.757 --> 18:51.773
Now go do the right thing
and turn yourself in.

18:51.825 --> 18:53.980
Uh... no.

18:54.480 --> 18:55.761
We hugged it out.

18:55.813 --> 18:58.379
I forgave him, he forgave
me. That's how it works.

18:58.699 --> 19:01.215
Not sure why you unhooked my bra.

19:01.281 --> 19:03.331
That's how I work.

19:03.704 --> 19:05.704
Adios, Brad. I'll see
you in five to ten.

19:05.706 --> 19:07.639
What? Wait, Luis!

19:07.675 --> 19:09.474
What... why aren't we going after him.

19:09.476 --> 19:10.609
We can't let him get away!

19:10.644 --> 19:11.660
Oh, don't worry, honey.

19:11.695 --> 19:14.496
We got his entire confession on camera.

19:14.548 --> 19:15.881
Hell yeah, I got it!

19:15.933 --> 19:16.933
Woo-Hoo!

19:16.967 --> 19:18.639
Hey, is green on or off?

19:19.321 --> 19:20.842
Oh, I didn't get it.

19:26.527 --> 19:27.826
Hey, bro. I was...

19:27.861 --> 19:29.823
If you're here to give me advice
from your stupid baby book,

19:29.847 --> 19:31.223
I'm good.

19:31.815 --> 19:33.698
I know I never tell you this...

19:33.723 --> 19:35.867
but you're a great brother,

19:35.903 --> 19:37.786
and a great dad.

19:37.821 --> 19:39.905
Oh my God, are you dying?

19:39.957 --> 19:41.790
You can't leave me here with Mom.

19:42.876 --> 19:44.284
Sometimes I feel like I'm going crazy

19:44.309 --> 19:45.827
and the baby's not even here yet.

19:45.879 --> 19:48.497
I just want everything to go perfectly.

19:48.549 --> 19:49.965
You make it all seem so easy.

19:50.000 --> 19:53.752
Man, when it comes to
kids, there is no perfect.

19:53.804 --> 19:55.481
Nothing in your book
is going to prepare you

19:55.514 --> 19:57.923
for the roller coaster
that is being a parent.

19:58.326 --> 20:00.976
And you really need to
cut Riley some slack, man.

20:01.319 --> 20:02.978
She's already pretty terrified.

20:03.013 --> 20:04.615
I know, man.

20:05.729 --> 20:06.845
Hey, uh,

20:06.934 --> 20:08.900
you wanna help me burn this book?

20:09.029 --> 20:10.945
Um, I've got a better idea.

20:14.858 --> 20:16.558
Blame Tucker! Blame Tucker!

20:21.410 --> 20:24.363
Do you really think I can get
Luis's confession again?

20:24.388 --> 20:26.886
I'd be shocked if you didn't.

20:31.028 --> 20:32.566
Wait a minute.

20:32.591 --> 20:33.886
I don't see Luis.

20:33.911 --> 20:35.961
Ahh!

20:36.221 --> 20:37.971
- You!
- Oh!

20:40.188 --> 20:42.188
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow!

20:42.213 --> 20:44.079
- Yeah, come here, come here.
- Ow!
