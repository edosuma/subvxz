WEBVTT

01:06.901 --> 01:09.036
Come on.

01:09.070 --> 01:10.337
- Simon.
- <i>Hello?</i>

01:10.370 --> 01:13.808
Did you put the poster of Harry
and the penguin in my office?

01:13.841 --> 01:16.676
- <i>Yeah. Shall I...</i>
- Get it out! Thank you.

01:16.711 --> 01:18.678
That campaign was
a complete disaster,

01:18.713 --> 01:21.716
and I don't need reminding
that his image needs

01:21.749 --> 01:23.483
a complete overhaul.

01:23.517 --> 01:24.384
<i>Uh, okay.</i>

01:24.417 --> 01:26.087
And can someone please
explain to Harry

01:26.120 --> 01:27.654
if he wants to
be a humanitarian,

01:27.687 --> 01:29.623
he has to save humans,
not penguins.

01:29.656 --> 01:30.657
<i>I'll contact...</i>

01:38.532 --> 01:41.635
<i>WNN brings you this
report on the orphan refugee crisis.</i>

01:41.668 --> 01:43.738
<i>Live from the
Ukbar-Georgia border.</i>

01:45.472 --> 01:46.774
<i>We go to Mark Phillips.</i>

01:46.808 --> 01:48.843
<i>Where is this world's
conscience?</i>

01:56.818 --> 01:59.586
Matt, Kate. Kate.

01:59.619 --> 02:02.522
Stop talking.
I've... I've had an idea.

02:02.556 --> 02:06.027
Top secret, but I've, uh,
found a campaign to put Harry onto.

02:06.060 --> 02:08.428
There's a war in, um,

02:08.930 --> 02:10.832
Georgia and Ukbar,

02:10.865 --> 02:13.600
wherever the hell that is,
that literally no one gives a shit about.

02:13.633 --> 02:17.038
It's got everything.
Refugees, landmines, orphans, white people.

02:17.071 --> 02:19.040
So, I wanna
put on a concert.

02:19.073 --> 02:21.876
The biggest peace concert the world
has ever seen, bigger than Live 8,

02:21.909 --> 02:24.411
and we'll have Katy Perry,
Ed Sheeran,

02:24.444 --> 02:27.581
Beyonce,
and Harry topping the bill.

02:27.614 --> 02:29.583
This is gonna take him
to the next level.

02:29.616 --> 02:31.018
What do you say?

02:31.052 --> 02:33.988
Do you wanna join me
in changing the world?

02:34.021 --> 02:36.023
<i>This is Matt
from Dim Sum Now.</i>

02:36.057 --> 02:38.726
Sorry, wrong number.
Yeah, um, Matt from, yeah,

02:38.759 --> 02:41.695
can I have the pork dumplings

02:41.729 --> 02:44.397
and, um, some spring rolls?

02:44.431 --> 02:46.433
Thanks so much.
Thank you.

03:32.046 --> 03:33.580
Okay, what time
are we now?

03:33.613 --> 03:36.050
- <i>Five, four, three...</i>
- Hope! Hope!

03:36.083 --> 03:37.885
<i>...two, one.</i>

03:37.919 --> 03:39.586
Cue hype woman.

03:39.619 --> 03:40.687
Harry!

03:40.721 --> 03:42.555
- Hope!
- Harry!

03:47.128 --> 03:50.630
Ladies and gentlemen,
are you ready for some hope in your life?

03:50.664 --> 03:52.066
That's it, volunteers.

03:52.099 --> 03:54.802
The man,
the myth, the legend,

03:54.835 --> 03:59.707
Harry Hope!

03:59.740 --> 04:01.776
Beautiful people of London.

04:01.809 --> 04:04.477
In four days' time,

04:04.511 --> 04:06.747
the world will come together

04:06.781 --> 04:11.085
for the biggest peace gig
known to mankind.

04:11.118 --> 04:14.688
Whoo!

04:17.959 --> 04:19.860
The power of music
will stop this war.

04:19.894 --> 04:24.799
The unifying power of music
will stop this war!

04:26.633 --> 04:28.002
<i>Pump your fist.</i>

04:31.604 --> 04:32.974
I call upon the leaders...

04:33.007 --> 04:36.509
I call upon the leaders
of the world to tune in

04:36.543 --> 04:41.182
and listen to what four
billion people have to say!

04:41.215 --> 04:42.883
Yes!

04:42.917 --> 04:45.119
Stop the war!
Stop the war!

04:45.152 --> 04:45.987
<i>Let the volunteers
rush the stage.</i>

04:46.020 --> 04:47.188
No, no, no, let 'em in,
let 'em in.

04:47.221 --> 04:49.790
Come on... Let them, it's fine.
Come on, let them through.

04:49.824 --> 04:51.292
Come on, you, come, come.

04:51.325 --> 04:52.692
- You see, guys, it's...
- Okay.

04:52.727 --> 04:54.195
It's not about me, it's...

04:57.597 --> 04:59.900
it's about...
it's about these guys.

05:01.035 --> 05:03.304
You know, I'm...

05:03.337 --> 05:05.206
- I'm pretty much like the, uh...
- Cut the ginger.

05:05.239 --> 05:07.908
Out my way.
Okay, shh, I'm coming.

05:07.942 --> 05:09.642
I'm... I'm just the...

05:11.812 --> 05:14.647
You know how a duck flies
and the head of it,

05:14.681 --> 05:15.750
- it migrates?
- Yeah?

05:15.783 --> 05:18.618
- You ever played Duck Hunt before?
- Yeah!

05:18.651 --> 05:20.687
Kate, hijab hipster
on your right.

05:20.721 --> 05:21.856
Got it, got it.

05:21.889 --> 05:23.290
I'm not the dog,
I'm the duck.

05:23.324 --> 05:26.060
He's not the dog,
he's the duck!

05:26.093 --> 05:28.829
Three, two, one,
off you go.

05:28.863 --> 05:29.897
Fuck off.

05:29.930 --> 05:31.298
Ginger eliminated.

05:32.033 --> 05:34.601
- Go ahead.
- Okay, sing a song.

05:35.668 --> 05:39.106
<i>♪ Hope is dope ♪</i>

05:39.140 --> 05:42.609
<i>♪ Hope is dope ♪</i>

05:42.642 --> 05:46.013
<i>♪ You can cope ♪</i>

05:46.047 --> 05:48.983
<i>♪ Hope is dope ♪</i>

05:49.016 --> 05:52.086

<i>♪ I'm saying hope is dope

05:59.927 --> 06:01.694
Peace...

06:01.729 --> 06:05.800
Um... Simon,
my sister has arrived from...

06:05.833 --> 06:07.334
Throop in Dorset.

06:07.368 --> 06:09.837
Can you keep her occupied? I don't want
to see her until after the concert.

06:09.870 --> 06:11.638
I could put her
on the phones.

06:12.339 --> 06:13.640
Peace.

06:14.041 --> 06:15.209
No.

06:15.242 --> 06:17.644
- Envelope stuffing?
- No.

06:17.978 --> 06:19.679
Coffee.

06:19.713 --> 06:21.949
Cold drinks. Maybe she can
hold cold drinks.

06:21.982 --> 06:26.220
Because we want
to end this war!

06:28.722 --> 06:30.991
Harry, Harry!
It's a ceasefire!

06:31.025 --> 06:32.960
<i>The war is over.</i>

06:32.993 --> 06:34.128
<i>We now go live to Ukbar,</i>

06:34.161 --> 06:37.765
<i>where the governor is making
the shock announcement.</i>

06:37.798 --> 06:39.900
<i>The ceasefire
between our two nations</i>

06:39.934 --> 06:41.302
<i>will come into effect.</i>

06:42.336 --> 06:44.939
Make this go away.
Just... just make it go away.

06:44.972 --> 06:46.774
Make peace go away?

06:46.807 --> 06:48.776
Yes. You make
other things go away.

06:48.809 --> 06:50.010
Why can't you
make this go away?

06:50.044 --> 06:52.246
This isn't a story, Harry,
it's, um,

06:52.279 --> 06:55.216
two sovereign nations
with armies.

06:55.249 --> 06:57.051
This is my chance
at a Nobel Peace Prize!

06:57.084 --> 06:58.752
Both sides declared
the ceasefire, Harry.

06:58.786 --> 07:02.223
I've got Grammys, BRITs,
Tonys, Oscars!

07:02.256 --> 07:03.958
I... I wanna be
a world leader!

07:03.991 --> 07:05.359
A global humanitarian!

07:05.392 --> 07:07.660
Mandela, Gandhi!

07:07.694 --> 07:10.397
I can't do that without stopping a
war, Kate. This is my time!

07:10.431 --> 07:11.999
What are they talking about?

07:12.533 --> 07:14.001
I've no idea.

07:14.034 --> 07:17.204
Hi! I'm Peggy.
I'm Kate's sister.

07:17.238 --> 07:19.006
And her new PA.

07:19.907 --> 07:21.308
I'm Kate's PA.

07:22.977 --> 07:24.145
Oh.

07:25.913 --> 07:28.015
What are you looking at?

07:28.048 --> 07:29.216
Um, shall we get a coffee?

07:29.250 --> 07:30.718
Yeah, let's get a coffee.

07:33.988 --> 07:37.057
I've got four billion people
waiting for peace, Kate.

07:37.091 --> 07:39.160
Four billion people
waiting for peace!

07:39.193 --> 07:41.028
Why can't he wait
until Saturday?

07:41.061 --> 07:43.931
Damn, after Saturday he can
have all the peace he wants.

07:46.233 --> 07:47.401
That's it.

07:48.802 --> 07:50.971
We don't need to
call off the ceasefire,

07:51.005 --> 07:54.141
we just need a few more
days of skirmishes.

07:54.175 --> 07:56.710
Just skirmishes
on the border.

07:56.744 --> 07:58.112
I'm... I'm not following.

07:58.145 --> 08:00.181
We just need three more days of
fake news coming out of Georgia,

08:00.214 --> 08:02.149
to make it look like
the war's still on.

08:02.183 --> 08:04.285
Then you do the concert
on Saturday,

08:04.318 --> 08:05.452
then we can have peace.

08:05.486 --> 08:07.054
- Thanks to me.
- All thanks to you.

08:07.087 --> 08:08.255
Great! Good.

08:08.289 --> 08:09.757
You better get out there
and get on it.

08:09.790 --> 08:11.258
- Sorry?
- Georgia!

08:11.292 --> 08:13.894
I need you to go out there
and start up some skirmishes,

08:13.928 --> 08:16.931
with CNN, BBC,
all the major news outlets,

08:16.964 --> 08:18.465
whoever the hell
you need to get.

08:18.499 --> 08:21.135
You're always saying that one
image can change the world.

08:21.168 --> 08:23.804
And so...

08:23.837 --> 08:27.141
I want those screens
filled with despair.

08:27.174 --> 08:28.909
Yeah.

08:28.943 --> 08:30.844
Yeah, you can't have
hope without despair.

08:30.878 --> 08:32.746
Mmm. I'm testing that theory
right now.

08:32.780 --> 08:35.015
Rape! Planes!

08:35.049 --> 08:36.250
Images of death!

08:36.283 --> 08:37.451
Dead kittens!

08:37.484 --> 08:38.919
The puppies
that can't get adopted.

08:38.953 --> 08:40.453
Okay? Whatever the hell
you need to do,

08:40.486 --> 08:42.056
just make it happen.

08:43.357 --> 08:44.491
Okay.

08:46.860 --> 08:48.762
Oh, and if you don't,
you're fired.

08:50.097 --> 08:51.298
Why Japan?

08:51.332 --> 08:52.900
'Cause they meditate
with the cows.

08:52.933 --> 08:54.768
Matt, hand all press liaison
over to Marie.

08:54.802 --> 08:57.171
Simon, hand all artist liaison
over to Ravier.

08:57.204 --> 09:00.808
Rape, planes, images of murder,
all the good stuff.

09:00.841 --> 09:03.410
For the next three days, we push
the line that this war is still on.

09:03.444 --> 09:05.179
Well, who's handling this
for us?

09:05.212 --> 09:06.347
We are.

09:06.380 --> 09:09.917
Yeah,
we run red carpets and press junkets.

09:09.950 --> 09:11.452
What do we know about war?

09:12.353 --> 09:13.821
Enough to fake one.

09:29.536 --> 09:30.838
Hello.

09:35.976 --> 09:37.778
Can I help
with anything?

09:39.313 --> 09:40.414
Can I help?

09:42.182 --> 09:43.550
Can I help with anything?

09:43.584 --> 09:45.386
Of course,
you're her new PA.

09:45.419 --> 09:48.455
Book us all flights.
All of us to Tbilisi.

09:58.432 --> 09:59.466
Hello?

09:59.500 --> 10:00.934
Taxi!

10:06.106 --> 10:08.108
Move back, move back.

10:20.187 --> 10:22.156
Uh, it's this way.
This way.

10:37.404 --> 10:39.006
This is it, this is the gate.

10:39.473 --> 10:40.474
Come on!

10:41.375 --> 10:42.910
Guys, come on!

10:42.943 --> 10:45.312
Those two, uh, him and him.

10:46.013 --> 10:47.147
And that's yours.

10:48.582 --> 10:50.551
This place is really big.
Have a nice flight.

10:50.584 --> 10:52.186
Thank you.

10:52.219 --> 10:54.388
He needs to go with this line for
the news at 10:00. The ceasefire is...

10:54.421 --> 10:56.223
- Excuse me.
- The ceasefire is...

10:56.256 --> 10:58.025
Miss, excuse me.

10:58.058 --> 11:00.394
Turn off your phone,
please. Now.

11:00.427 --> 11:02.096
I'll call you
when I land.

11:10.070 --> 11:11.338
I've never been
on a plane before.

11:11.372 --> 11:12.506
What are you doing?

11:12.539 --> 11:13.974
Trying to make
this seat go back.

11:14.007 --> 11:15.542
What are you doing
on the plane?

11:17.044 --> 11:18.112
Simon...

11:19.313 --> 11:20.514
Peggy's on the plane.

11:20.547 --> 11:21.648
Free peanuts.

11:21.682 --> 11:23.350
Why are you on the plane?

11:23.384 --> 11:24.585
You said to
book us all flights.

11:24.618 --> 11:27.221
I said book us all flights.

11:27.254 --> 11:29.289
You went like that.
I thought I was in the circle.

11:29.323 --> 11:30.457
Sit down.
We are taking off.

11:30.491 --> 11:33.260
No, it was a clerical error.
We don't want her with us.

11:33.293 --> 11:34.461
Sit down, please.

11:34.495 --> 11:36.096
- I've done it!
- Can we stop it?

11:36.130 --> 11:37.464
Mister, please!

11:37.498 --> 11:39.466
Oh, it's a disaster.

11:56.049 --> 11:57.418
Ooh, a shelf.

11:58.720 --> 12:00.387
Oh, you've got one too.

12:05.092 --> 12:06.693
Why are we going to Georgia?

12:06.728 --> 12:10.230
I am going to Georgia to
shoot some documentary footage

12:10.264 --> 12:11.498
for the concert.

12:11.532 --> 12:13.701
You are going to go straight
back home as soon as we land.

12:15.169 --> 12:17.204
Well, if there's
anything you need...

12:17.237 --> 12:18.405
I need silence.

12:20.140 --> 12:21.442
This is crazy.

12:23.076 --> 12:26.246
Look, Kate knows exactly
what she's doing.

12:26.280 --> 12:29.483
We're going to a warzone
and I'm wearing slip-ons.

12:29.516 --> 12:31.985
<i>Reports from the CIA
suggest Ukbar</i>

12:32.019 --> 12:34.221
<i>may have already
broken the ceasefire.</i>

12:34.254 --> 12:35.422
<i>Where's the evidence?</i>

12:35.456 --> 12:39.159
<i>Just a series of websites
that have no credibility.</i>

12:39.193 --> 12:42.062
<i>We haven't seen any new
images of war from the region.</i>

12:50.070 --> 12:53.240
<i>Ladies and
gentlemen, welcome to Tugdidi Airport.</i>

12:53.574 --> 12:55.476
Excuse me.

12:55.509 --> 12:56.677
Did he say Tugdidi Airport?

12:56.711 --> 12:59.480
We were
diverted because of the crisis.

13:01.515 --> 13:03.217
Where's Tugdidi?

13:08.188 --> 13:10.390
The CIA has quoted
our BuzzFeed story.

13:10.424 --> 13:13.494
Yes. They've already
fed it to Fox News.

13:13.527 --> 13:14.729
Our driver's in Tbilisi.

13:14.762 --> 13:16.563
How are we meant
to get to Kazbegi now?

13:16.597 --> 13:18.265
We're meant to be
on the frontline.

13:18.298 --> 13:19.466
Well, Uber.

13:20.100 --> 13:21.134
MyTaxi.

13:24.505 --> 13:26.440
Urgh. Unbelievable.

13:28.509 --> 13:31.411
All the flights are grounded.
I'm gonna have to stick with you guys.

13:31.445 --> 13:33.146
I can book her into a hotel

13:33.180 --> 13:34.681
until they start
flying out again.

13:34.716 --> 13:36.483
You can stay here,
can't you?

13:36.517 --> 13:38.085
Yeah? Be okay?

13:38.118 --> 13:39.286
Yeah?

13:41.255 --> 13:42.489
No, she'll have to
come with us.

13:42.523 --> 13:43.758
- No, I can book her...
- She's coming with me,

13:43.791 --> 13:45.058
where I can keep
an eye on her.

13:45.092 --> 13:46.293
Don't tell Mum, okay?

13:46.326 --> 13:48.262
Ooh, it's just so exciting!

13:48.295 --> 13:51.331
Will one of you sort
some bloody transport now?

13:53.634 --> 13:55.469
Harry, hi.

13:55.502 --> 13:56.537
<i>Where the hell are you?</i>

13:56.570 --> 13:58.405
Well, um, I don't know,
'cause we got diverted.

13:58.438 --> 14:00.541
We need images, Kate.
Footage of the war.

14:00.574 --> 14:01.809
Stop pissing around.

14:01.843 --> 14:03.644
You have 96 hours
to fix this.

14:03.677 --> 14:05.279
I only landed
half an hour ago, so...

14:05.312 --> 14:07.114
If I don't get that
Nobel Peace Prize,

14:07.147 --> 14:08.682
I will hold you
personally responsible.

14:08.716 --> 14:10.117
Get it done!

14:10.150 --> 14:11.385
<i>Now I have to go.</i>

14:11.418 --> 14:13.320
I'm playing poker
with the Dalai Lama

14:13.353 --> 14:14.756
and he cheats like a...

14:17.859 --> 14:19.626
Well?

14:19.660 --> 14:21.562
Auntie Kate?

14:21.595 --> 14:24.231
Don't tell me you're
taking a bloody selfie.

14:24.264 --> 14:26.099
- Auntie Kate?
- What?

14:26.133 --> 14:30.504
Uh, this man here says he'll
take us to Kazbegi for 300 lari.

14:30.537 --> 14:32.506
Is that a lot?
It sounds like a lot.

14:33.407 --> 14:35.676
Uh, hello.
Hello, hi.

14:36.577 --> 14:38.545
Hi. Uh, we need to go here.

14:39.479 --> 14:41.648
To the frontline, yeah?

14:41.682 --> 14:44.251
Um, I'll pay you.
Me pay you.

14:44.284 --> 14:46.153
No, okay, well,
tell him I'll pay him.

14:46.186 --> 14:48.589
I'll pay him 2,000 lari.

14:49.222 --> 14:52.092
2,000 laris.

14:52.827 --> 14:53.828
Yes?

14:54.494 --> 14:56.263
Okay, yes,
he says yes, yes.

15:11.813 --> 15:13.347
When we get
where we're going, Peggy,

15:13.380 --> 15:14.749
I want you to stay in the car.

15:16.183 --> 15:17.819
I'm gonna stay
in the car too.

15:17.852 --> 15:19.252
I think I might too.

15:19.286 --> 15:20.454
- No, you're coming.
- I don't want to.

15:20.487 --> 15:22.556
I think this is crazy.
There, I said it.

15:22.589 --> 15:23.624
You'll do it because
it's your job.

15:23.657 --> 15:26.226
I didn't sign up for going
into a warzone, okay?

15:26.259 --> 15:28.730
We didn't even go to T in the
Park because it's too dangerous.

15:28.763 --> 15:29.931
And now we're going
to a frontline?

15:29.964 --> 15:31.498
Don't push me on this, Matt!

16:15.910 --> 16:18.378
Kate Hemmings,
I'm Manu, the fixer.

16:18.412 --> 16:20.480
Manu. Simon Boggan.

16:20.514 --> 16:24.217
We were diverted to Tugdidi.
Nightmare.

16:24.251 --> 16:26.821
Okay, what we need is, um,

16:27.387 --> 16:29.556
is footage of soldiers,

16:29.589 --> 16:32.392
if we can get some tanks
or artillery moving,

16:32.426 --> 16:34.361
doesn't matter which way,
we can edit round that.

16:34.394 --> 16:36.798
But what we need
is kinetic images,

16:36.831 --> 16:39.332
uh, fog of war and all that.

16:39.366 --> 16:40.667
Distressed locals.

16:41.969 --> 16:45.238
The Ukbars, they pulled out
since ceasefire.

16:45.272 --> 16:46.774
Oh, okay.

16:46.808 --> 16:48.009
What about the Georgian army?

16:48.042 --> 16:49.676
Well, they pulled back too.

16:49.711 --> 16:51.813
You know, the part
of peace negotiation.

16:51.846 --> 16:53.280
Distressed locals?

17:03.690 --> 17:05.727
This is meant to be the...
the frontline.

17:05.760 --> 17:07.560
You said yesterday
this was the frontline.

17:07.594 --> 17:09.463
Well, it was. But then
they called the ceasefire.

17:09.496 --> 17:11.531
Oh, this is a bloody disaster.

17:11.565 --> 17:12.733
Take us to the hotel.

17:24.544 --> 17:26.848
There's not many
places to stay around here,

17:26.881 --> 17:29.616
so you have to stay
in my cousin's rooms.

17:30.684 --> 17:33.054
This is the best hotel
in Kazbegi.

17:33.087 --> 17:36.423
All rooms are booked,
but I pulled some strings.

17:55.475 --> 17:58.545
We are booked up,
but we have this.

17:59.412 --> 18:01.414
Okay.

18:01.448 --> 18:03.316
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

18:03.350 --> 18:05.019
And this one is for ladies.

18:10.958 --> 18:12.392
Drink?

18:16.563 --> 18:18.565
You're blowing bubbles.

18:18.598 --> 18:20.802
Yeah, I like bubbles.

18:21.869 --> 18:24.304
You're cute.

18:30.677 --> 18:32.679
<i>After today's
reports of border skirmishes</i>

18:32.713 --> 18:34.015
<i>on the Georgian-Ukbar border,</i>

18:34.048 --> 18:35.515
<i>we now hear live
from the governor.</i>

18:35.549 --> 18:36.583
Yes!

18:37.885 --> 18:40.855
<i>Lies, lies, lies.</i>

18:40.888 --> 18:44.658
<i>The Internet is
flooded with CIA lies.</i>

18:44.691 --> 18:47.128
<i>The CIA will not stop me</i>

18:47.161 --> 18:49.831
<i>from securing peace
in our region.</i>

18:54.035 --> 18:55.502
<i>What the fuck
is going on?</i>

18:55.535 --> 18:57.637
Boris is up
for a Nobel Prize?

18:57.671 --> 18:59.774
That's the exact opposite
of what I asked you to do!

18:59.807 --> 19:01.008
Well, we're working on it.

19:01.042 --> 19:03.010
<i>I'm about to have
a seaweed wrap</i>

19:03.044 --> 19:05.345
with fucking Hilary Clinton!
Naked!

19:07.647 --> 19:08.716
Is that her?

19:08.749 --> 19:10.017
She's gone for nachos.

19:10.051 --> 19:12.419
That's how committed
I am to this concert,

19:12.452 --> 19:13.520
and you're just
screwing about?

19:13.553 --> 19:14.722
Okay, well look,

19:14.755 --> 19:17.657
this situation is more
complicated than we first thought.

19:17.691 --> 19:18.860
I don't give
a fuck about that!

19:18.893 --> 19:20.527
I'm your universe, Kate!

19:20.560 --> 19:22.897
Obey my physics!

19:22.930 --> 19:24.866
What? I didn't understand that.

19:24.899 --> 19:26.834
Spin whatever you need
to spin, all right?

19:26.868 --> 19:29.704
Just, just undermine
this ceasefire and stop Boris!

19:29.737 --> 19:31.404
- Okay.
- <i>78 hours, Kate.</i>

19:31.438 --> 19:32.840
78 hours!

19:32.874 --> 19:34.108
Oh, God.

19:34.141 --> 19:35.575
Nachos.

19:35.609 --> 19:37.011
Oh, my God, yum.

19:37.778 --> 19:38.846
Bye.

19:42.950 --> 19:44.517
There are no budget caps.

19:44.551 --> 19:46.020
We just need to think big.

19:46.053 --> 19:47.654
Big like Kanye big.

19:47.687 --> 19:49.556
Oh, sorry, sorry,
excuse me, excuse me,

19:49.589 --> 19:51.591
I really need to pee!

19:51.625 --> 19:53.761
- Ugh, it's Harry, again.
- Ugh!

19:53.794 --> 19:55.629
It's a bit awkward
with everyone in here.

19:55.662 --> 19:56.797
- What shall I say?
- Cut the call.

19:56.831 --> 19:58.431
We've never
cut the call from Harry.

19:58.465 --> 19:59.834
Cut the call.

19:59.867 --> 20:03.037
Oh, guys, I really don't
think I can go while you're in here.

20:03.070 --> 20:04.705
Mind if I sing?

20:04.739 --> 20:06.140
Just to distract myself?

20:06.173 --> 20:07.407
I really need to go.

20:07.440 --> 20:09.744
We just need an iconic video
clip, no more than 30 seconds,

20:09.777 --> 20:12.113
that says war,
conflict, genocide.

20:26.861 --> 20:28.763
I have an idea.

20:28.796 --> 20:29.897
It's working!

20:36.636 --> 20:38.139
More smoke here.

20:42.176 --> 20:45.079
Cry, cry, like,
cry.

20:46.280 --> 20:48.481
Cry, cry.

20:51.886 --> 20:53.653
More smoke, more smoke.

20:58.926 --> 21:00.493
Where's the dead kids?

21:00.527 --> 21:01.862
Where are the dead kids?

21:03.898 --> 21:05.498
And cut!

21:06.200 --> 21:07.634
That was good.

21:09.937 --> 21:11.205
Very good, very good.

21:11.238 --> 21:13.074
That was brilliant,
well done.

21:13.107 --> 21:14.108
Very good.

21:14.976 --> 21:16.077
Okay, great.

21:16.110 --> 21:18.145
Um, what are we doing again?

21:19.679 --> 21:20.915
Backdrop visuals.

21:21.481 --> 21:23.483
Backdrop visuals? Cool.

21:26.020 --> 21:27.687
Okay, Manu?

21:27.722 --> 21:29.090
- Yes, I'm here.
- Ah.

21:29.123 --> 21:30.725
We're gonna go again. We're gonna
go for the explosion now, okay?

21:30.758 --> 21:32.226
Okay.

21:32.259 --> 21:34.561
Okay, action,
and cue explosion!

21:37.098 --> 21:38.899
Cue explosion!

21:43.771 --> 21:45.605
That was pathetic.

21:45.638 --> 21:46.841
Um, yeah.

21:46.874 --> 21:48.142
Um, Kate...

21:50.878 --> 21:53.080
- can I ask you a question?
- Is it annoying?

21:54.647 --> 21:56.784
Okay, an observation.

21:56.817 --> 21:59.253
Are we sure that
when we're at Harry's concert

21:59.286 --> 22:01.322
and he's singing,
that we want everyone

22:01.355 --> 22:03.690
to see an elderly lady
being blown to bits?

22:06.894 --> 22:08.329
Simon,
Peggy's asking questions.

22:08.362 --> 22:09.662
Manu.

22:12.033 --> 22:12.867
Get off me.

22:12.900 --> 22:14.201
Look, maybe you should
wait in the car.

22:14.235 --> 22:15.403
I'm not going to the car!

22:15.436 --> 22:18.139
Look, Kate doesn't want you
here, no one wants you here.

22:18.172 --> 22:21.008
Hey, hey, she can help me
if she likes.

22:21.042 --> 22:22.209
Well, she'll screw it up.

22:22.243 --> 22:23.676
Come on,
she'll be fine.

22:25.312 --> 22:27.580
Really big,
you know, woo.

22:27.614 --> 22:29.250
I mean, it's gotta be
scary stuff.

22:31.352 --> 22:33.287
Right.

22:33.320 --> 22:35.622
- Come on, this is gonna be the one.
- This is it.

22:35.655 --> 22:37.291
- All right.
- Sorry. Aah...

22:37.324 --> 22:40.027
- Good thinking, Peggy, good thinking.
- Oh, nice.

22:40.061 --> 22:42.029
You can never have
enough dynamite.

22:42.063 --> 22:44.131
Thank you.
You can just put it behind.

22:44.832 --> 22:45.866
Okay, great.

22:49.970 --> 22:51.305
Okay, this is
gonna be great.

22:51.338 --> 22:52.773
It is gonna be fantastic.

22:52.807 --> 22:54.742
- Ready?
- Ready.

22:54.775 --> 22:57.078
You know what Kate says
about you, don't you?

22:57.111 --> 22:58.712
- What does she say?
- Fuck all.

22:58.746 --> 22:59.780
Ugh, these are
too small for me.

22:59.814 --> 23:01.382
Right, that's it.

23:01.415 --> 23:03.117
You do the clapperboard.

23:04.684 --> 23:06.686
Take one. Great.

23:06.720 --> 23:11.258
Okay, so,
one, two, three,

23:11.292 --> 23:13.027
cue explosion!

23:18.032 --> 23:19.100
So good!

23:19.133 --> 23:20.935
Certainly know
how to pack a punch.

23:21.335 --> 23:22.837
Well done!

23:24.405 --> 23:25.706
Oh, wow.

23:26.340 --> 23:27.640
Oh, wow.

23:29.043 --> 23:30.744
That was great.

23:31.479 --> 23:32.880
- Great.
- So, uh, good news.

23:32.913 --> 23:34.281
Uh, Manu's cousin,

23:34.315 --> 23:37.084
he's just agreed to drive
Peggy across the border,

23:37.118 --> 23:40.855
to Azerbaijan, where she can
get a flight home via Turkey.

23:41.455 --> 23:43.424
Great news, right?

23:43.457 --> 23:45.793
Uh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Thanks, Simon, thanks.

23:47.461 --> 23:48.829
Yeah, great.

23:59.306 --> 24:00.875
Think we got
some great footage.

24:00.908 --> 24:02.977
Very exciting.
Very exciting.

24:13.187 --> 24:14.555
It's quite good,
'cause what you see is

24:14.588 --> 24:17.224
sort of, that look of fear in her
eyes just before she explodes.

24:17.258 --> 24:18.325
Mmm.

24:18.359 --> 24:20.761
I was wondering whether
we should make that, like,

24:20.794 --> 24:22.730
more of a tear in her eye
just before...

24:22.763 --> 24:24.865
- Can you do that?
- Yeah, you can do that, yeah.

24:31.372 --> 24:33.340
- Hmm.
- Mmm.

24:33.374 --> 24:36.911
Can you put a bit more
blood around the temples,

24:36.944 --> 24:38.345
or would that be too much,
do you think?

24:38.379 --> 24:39.780
No, no, I think
the more blood the better.

24:39.813 --> 24:41.348
'Cause, like,
the end of the day,

24:41.382 --> 24:43.317
you want people to puke,
if, if you can get them to.

24:45.853 --> 24:46.854
Ow!

24:52.259 --> 24:54.694
Simon booked me
a flight, home.

24:56.497 --> 24:59.233
Can you make that child's legs
a bit shorter then?

24:59.266 --> 25:00.467
Well, like, then
they look littler

25:00.501 --> 25:01.802
and they look
more vulnerable,

25:01.835 --> 25:03.737
- so when they get blown up, it looks better.
- Of course, yeah.

25:03.771 --> 25:05.773
So I guess this is bye.

25:17.985 --> 25:19.186
Oh, yeah!

25:21.388 --> 25:23.457
700 hits and that's, what?

25:23.490 --> 25:25.025
How has that
happened already?

25:25.059 --> 25:27.127
Well, it's because
the content is disgusting.

25:28.195 --> 25:29.964
Yeah, right there!

25:29.997 --> 25:31.398
Look at the comments.

25:32.566 --> 25:35.536
<i>The United Nations has failed
to secure the region.</i>

25:35.569 --> 25:38.973
<i>Now, Harry Hope could be
the only chance of peace.</i>

25:40.274 --> 25:41.442
Simon...

26:19.113 --> 26:22.082
This is the weirdest
music video ever.

26:23.150 --> 26:24.785
What are you talking about?

26:26.287 --> 26:28.289
The video we're shooting.

26:29.556 --> 26:31.392
The music video.

26:33.160 --> 26:35.429
Has no one told you yet?

26:35.462 --> 26:37.464
We're not making a music video.

26:37.498 --> 26:39.533
We're making fake news.

26:39.566 --> 26:41.502
We're making it look like
the war's still going on,

26:41.535 --> 26:43.904
so there's a reason
to have the peace concert.

26:45.005 --> 26:47.241
Everything Harry does is fake.

26:48.142 --> 26:49.543
How do you not know that?

26:51.345 --> 26:52.880
Sorry, what?

26:54.648 --> 26:56.350
Are you serious?

26:56.383 --> 26:58.018
He's not even American.

26:59.953 --> 27:01.355
He's from Barking.

27:09.563 --> 27:11.565
Georgian wine is amazing.

27:11.598 --> 27:13.267
I need to talk to you.

27:13.967 --> 27:15.135
Okay.

27:15.169 --> 27:16.470
I know.

27:18.906 --> 27:20.307
Why couldn't you tell me?

27:21.942 --> 27:23.644
Were you ever gonna tell me?

27:23.677 --> 27:26.480
Well, um,
it involves other people.

27:26.513 --> 27:28.849
- When were you gonna tell me then?
- When the time was right.

27:32.186 --> 27:33.153
Are you okay with it?

27:33.187 --> 27:35.956
Yes, of course I'm okay with it.
I'm not a kid.

27:35.989 --> 27:38.092
What I'm not okay with is
everyone else knowing

27:38.125 --> 27:39.460
and not me,
and then I look like an idiot!

27:39.493 --> 27:40.928
No, of course.

27:43.197 --> 27:44.365
I'm shocked.

27:45.299 --> 27:46.467
Disappointed.

27:48.102 --> 27:49.570
How did you find out?

27:50.404 --> 27:51.405
Matt.

27:53.708 --> 27:54.942
Matt?

27:55.609 --> 27:57.311
How does he know?

27:57.344 --> 27:59.079
You can't keep it from him,
can you?

28:00.547 --> 28:03.117
You're making fake news
for Harry,

28:03.150 --> 28:04.651
he's the one
pointing the camera,

28:04.685 --> 28:07.856
- of course he knows.
- Oh.

28:09.656 --> 28:10.924
I thought I was being useful

28:10.958 --> 28:12.092
but actually I was
being an idiot!

28:12.126 --> 28:13.961
You're worse than Mum!

28:27.408 --> 28:30.444
I could've actually
been helpful.

28:30.477 --> 28:33.313
You never gave me the chance
and now I'm going home tomorrow.

28:35.149 --> 28:37.384
If you wanna stay,
I can cancel the flights.

28:39.653 --> 28:41.155
Really?

28:43.023 --> 28:44.258
I can stay?

28:45.159 --> 28:46.427
You're not messing?

28:50.330 --> 28:51.398
Okay.

28:53.500 --> 28:56.403
Well, if you have any more
secrets, now's your chance.

29:00.742 --> 29:02.710
You have to see this.

29:03.410 --> 29:05.979
Come on. Quick!

29:12.085 --> 29:15.155
<i>Following the distressing
images coming out of Georgia...</i>

29:15.189 --> 29:16.290
Yes!

29:16.323 --> 29:18.492
<i>Let's hear what the governor
of Ukbar has to say...</i>

29:18.525 --> 29:20.194
<i>live on WNN.</i>

29:22.596 --> 29:26.233
<i>I would like
to apologize to those</i>

29:26.266 --> 29:30.070
<i>who lost loved ones
in today's tragedy.</i>

29:30.103 --> 29:34.742
<i>This war's entirely
the fault of the Ukbar army.</i>

29:34.776 --> 29:36.043
No...

29:36.076 --> 29:38.512
<i>I take full responsibility</i>

29:38.545 --> 29:42.282
<i>and I promise to pay
reparations to the families.</i>

29:42.316 --> 29:45.519
<i>Please see this
not as an act of war</i>

29:45.552 --> 29:48.055
<i>but a stumble towards peace.</i>

29:48.088 --> 29:52.192
<i>Now I'll read the names
of the dead.</i>

29:52.226 --> 29:53.594
Oh, come on!

29:53.627 --> 29:56.363
<i>Laza Lazarask...</i>

29:56.396 --> 29:57.431
<i>Joseph Manchava...</i>

29:57.464 --> 30:01.001
Wait, so he's apologizing
for the story we faked?

30:04.338 --> 30:05.672
Something that literally
never happened?

30:05.707 --> 30:07.274
Is this how it works?

30:10.377 --> 30:12.479
Shit!

30:12.513 --> 30:14.716
He's played the doves card.
How can we top the doves card?

30:17.819 --> 30:21.655
Well, he's asking
for forgiveness

30:21.688 --> 30:23.590
for something we invented,

30:25.526 --> 30:28.095
so let's do
something unforgivable.

30:31.231 --> 30:36.069
Oh, this... is great.

30:43.143 --> 30:44.278
Oh...

30:44.311 --> 30:46.580
Oh, this is great.

30:49.817 --> 30:52.052
Simon, get them some drinks.

30:53.120 --> 30:54.588
Quick, quick. Come on.

30:56.189 --> 30:57.591
Freezing up here.

30:58.726 --> 31:00.260
All right, hold it.

31:00.294 --> 31:01.796
Okay, and blood.

31:08.135 --> 31:10.805
Where the hell
did you get this from?

31:10.838 --> 31:14.074
A farmer used to do it back in
Trefon to scare off the kids.

31:15.910 --> 31:17.277
With actual people?

31:17.311 --> 31:18.645
No!

31:18.679 --> 31:20.347
Cats and dogs, you freak.

31:25.619 --> 31:26.553
Yeah, great.

31:26.587 --> 31:28.288
All right, I need more lights,
more lamps.

31:28.322 --> 31:31.158
Okay, okay.

31:33.728 --> 31:35.295
Okay, good. Great.

31:35.329 --> 31:36.396
Great stuff.

31:39.901 --> 31:41.234
Oh, thank you.

31:42.904 --> 31:45.238
This is great.
Thank you.

31:48.575 --> 31:50.344
You know, I'm pleased
you got on that plane.

31:51.713 --> 31:53.347
- Really?
- Yeah.

31:53.380 --> 31:55.482
I want you to teach me
how to do it.

31:55.515 --> 31:56.918
I... I wanna come
and work with you

31:56.951 --> 31:58.452
and I wanna learn everything.

32:01.455 --> 32:04.658
Well, you need
to be ruthless

32:04.691 --> 32:06.627
and keep your eye
on the prize at all times

32:06.660 --> 32:08.763
even when everyone else
is losing their bottle.

32:10.597 --> 32:12.332
Okay. Ruthless,

32:12.366 --> 32:13.500
eyes on the prize.

32:13.533 --> 32:14.601
Got it.

32:15.535 --> 32:17.270
- Anything else?
- Gloves.

32:18.305 --> 32:19.874
Gloves. Got it.

32:21.375 --> 32:22.944
No, go and get me my gloves.

32:22.977 --> 32:24.411
Oh.

32:24.879 --> 32:25.880
Okay.

32:54.441 --> 32:56.711
<i>You know, I'm pleased
you got on that plane.</i>

33:06.821 --> 33:08.321
<i>I wanna come
and work with you,</i>

33:08.355 --> 33:10.457
<i>and I wanna learn everything.</i>

33:15.997 --> 33:17.364
Cheers.

33:26.673 --> 33:28.810
Good news,
the tumor is gone.

34:09.349 --> 34:11.384
Oh, oh, thank God!

34:12.418 --> 34:13.620
Hi, hello!

34:13.652 --> 34:15.388
Hi! I'm lost!

34:15.422 --> 34:17.290
Do you know the way out?

34:18.492 --> 34:19.793
Can you help me?

34:24.531 --> 34:25.733
What was that?

34:26.734 --> 34:28.002
Rifle shots.

34:30.036 --> 34:31.538
It's just hunters.

34:44.118 --> 34:45.652
Rolling.

34:45.685 --> 34:47.889
- Can they make some noises?
- More noise, please!

34:49.090 --> 34:50.456
More pain,
like you're crucified!

34:51.591 --> 34:54.694
What was that?

34:54.728 --> 34:56.496
I'm gonna go get some stills.

35:09.442 --> 35:11.645
Oh, there you are!

35:11.678 --> 35:12.880
Where have you been?

35:12.914 --> 35:15.817
Getting your bloody gloves.

35:15.850 --> 35:18.052
Why did it take so long?

35:18.085 --> 35:19.653
Did you not hear
the gunshots?

35:19.686 --> 35:21.421
If I can't trust you
to go to the car,

35:21.454 --> 35:22.656
I can't trust you
to do anything.

35:22.689 --> 35:23.858
Yes, I did hear them!

35:23.891 --> 35:26.994
Can't you hear me trying to
bloody tell you something?

35:27.028 --> 35:29.629
Don't speak to me like that!

35:29.663 --> 35:30.798
I was frightened!

35:30.832 --> 35:32.800
You weren't
as frightened as me!

35:33.633 --> 35:35.402
I think I was!

35:35.435 --> 35:37.071
How could you possibly be
more frightened than me

35:37.104 --> 35:38.605
when I was the one
being shot at?

35:38.638 --> 35:40.074
Because I'm your mum!

35:41.008 --> 35:43.510
You're her mum?

35:43.543 --> 35:44.879
- Matt!
- My mum.

35:44.912 --> 35:45.980
Matt!

35:50.051 --> 35:51.886
Fuck! Run!

35:51.919 --> 35:53.553
Run! Run!

35:53.587 --> 35:57.457
Run, run, run,
run, run, run! Run!

36:17.477 --> 36:18.578
We're gonna die.

36:18.612 --> 36:19.780
There's meant
to be a ceasefire,

36:19.814 --> 36:20.948
they're not allowed
to be shooting!

36:20.982 --> 36:23.784
You're the one telling everyone
the ceasefire's over!

36:23.818 --> 36:25.887
This is all your fault!

36:25.920 --> 36:27.154
Matt is dead!

36:27.188 --> 36:28.890
They shot me in the arm.

36:28.923 --> 36:31.491
Okay, well, we need to surrender.
We need to surrender.

36:31.524 --> 36:32.860
You, you go out there and you,

36:32.894 --> 36:35.196
you tell them that we're British

36:35.229 --> 36:36.663
and that we're very important.

36:36.696 --> 36:39.200
And they need
to look after us.

36:39.233 --> 36:41.035
No! No, no, no, no. No.

36:41.068 --> 36:42.770
No.

36:42.803 --> 36:44.071
No.

36:49.542 --> 36:50.644
Hello?

36:50.677 --> 36:54.715
We are British women and we,
we'd love to surrender.

37:00.254 --> 37:01.822
Oh!

37:04.992 --> 37:06.928
That's my arm!

37:08.996 --> 37:10.630
I'm getting you out of here!

37:20.975 --> 37:22.944
I can't believe
you're my mum.

38:16.330 --> 38:18.132
Oh, I'm so cold.

38:19.133 --> 38:21.068
Freezing.

38:21.102 --> 38:24.071
Clo... clo...

38:24.105 --> 38:27.141
Clothes off, off, off, off.

38:27.375 --> 38:28.843
Why?

38:32.346 --> 38:36.250
- Hypo... thermia.
- Oh, it's freezing.

38:44.792 --> 38:47.328
Oh, God, I'm so sorry.
Oh, I'm so...

38:54.268 --> 38:59.073
She... warm.

39:05.046 --> 39:10.284
She's... wa...

39:11.385 --> 39:12.619
Warm.

39:23.931 --> 39:25.299
Shh...

39:25.332 --> 39:26.599
Shh...

39:32.106 --> 39:33.606
Careful!

39:33.640 --> 39:35.608
Careful. It's got horns.

39:46.220 --> 39:49.824
There's no fucking way
I'm cuddling a cow.

39:52.793 --> 39:58.032
Can't we just cut her open
like in... "Star Wars"?

40:05.106 --> 40:07.607
Oh, God. Oh, no.

40:15.316 --> 40:16.350
Ugh.

40:25.025 --> 40:26.127
Ugh!

40:32.466 --> 40:33.968
Is it true?

40:36.203 --> 40:38.172
Your mum and dad
are your parents,

40:38.205 --> 40:39.340
that's all you need to know.

40:41.842 --> 40:43.878
What happened?

40:43.911 --> 40:45.279
I'll never replace your mum.

40:45.312 --> 40:47.781
I know that.

40:47.815 --> 40:50.251
You... you'd be a terrible mum.

40:57.291 --> 40:58.959
What happened then?

41:00.327 --> 41:02.796
Who's my biological dad?

41:06.500 --> 41:08.736
He was a seasonal worker...

41:10.237 --> 41:11.872
on Hopkins Farm.

41:13.807 --> 41:15.109
I was 15.

41:16.043 --> 41:17.411
It was one night,

41:19.046 --> 41:20.281
in a barn.

41:21.949 --> 41:25.319
By the time I realized
I was pregnant, he was gone.

41:26.187 --> 41:27.788
What happened then?

41:30.491 --> 41:32.293
I had to tell my mum.

41:35.863 --> 41:36.964
Which was awful.

41:38.065 --> 41:39.867
The worst day of my life.

41:39.900 --> 41:42.469
And so my mum,
sort of, took over.

41:42.503 --> 41:44.205
She made up the story.

41:44.238 --> 41:47.808
She put a cushion
under her clothes

41:47.841 --> 41:49.910
and I was sent away
for a few months.

41:51.445 --> 41:53.047
When you were born,

41:56.083 --> 41:58.052
Mum came and that was it.

42:01.522 --> 42:03.357
It must've been awful for you.

42:07.161 --> 42:08.362
It was.

42:11.265 --> 42:12.433
It was.

42:15.536 --> 42:17.171
I've never done this with...

42:18.572 --> 42:19.807
my other mum.

42:22.109 --> 42:23.944
What should I call you now?

42:24.511 --> 42:25.746
Bollocks.

42:44.999 --> 42:46.267
Oh, thank you.

42:48.068 --> 42:49.470
That's great, thank you.

42:52.072 --> 42:53.240
Thank you.

42:55.576 --> 43:00.047
Oh, yeah, once these are dry,
we can set off.

43:00.080 --> 43:02.216
- There are no streetlights.
- We need to get out of here.

43:03.951 --> 43:05.252
It's pitch back out there.

43:05.286 --> 43:07.087
We'll have to wait
until morning.

43:09.356 --> 43:11.992
Okay, tomorrow
we can walk around

43:12.026 --> 43:14.094
and we can find
somewhere with Internet,

43:14.128 --> 43:15.062
we'll get hold of Manu

43:15.095 --> 43:16.997
and he can get us the hell
out of Georgia.

43:17.031 --> 43:18.032
Hmm.

43:18.465 --> 43:20.167
Excuse me, um,

43:20.200 --> 43:22.269
do you have
an iPhone 8 charger?

43:24.238 --> 43:25.839
'Cause mine's run
out of battery.

43:31.178 --> 43:34.048
No, of course not.
It's a silly question.

43:34.081 --> 43:36.350
Just wondered.

43:39.453 --> 43:40.954
Ugh.

43:48.062 --> 43:50.364
Goal!

43:50.397 --> 43:52.366
"I am deeply sorry

43:53.901 --> 43:57.871
to have to tell you that
there's been an accident

43:58.539 --> 44:01.342
and Matt has been shot

44:02.343 --> 44:05.079
whilst taking stills

44:05.112 --> 44:06.947
for our latest campaign."

44:06.980 --> 44:08.115
What?

44:08.982 --> 44:10.017
It's just...

44:10.050 --> 44:11.518
- Go on, what?
- I dunno.

44:11.552 --> 44:14.121
Well, I'm in the
middle of it, so...

44:16.123 --> 44:18.125
Why not make it
sound like he was brave?

44:18.158 --> 44:20.961
This is stressful enough
without notes.

44:23.964 --> 44:26.300
I dunno. If it was me,
I'd like you to tell Mum

44:26.333 --> 44:29.002
that I died
doing something brave.

44:30.037 --> 44:32.106
- Don't say that.
- Well...

44:34.141 --> 44:36.009
You said his parents
were proud, right?

44:36.043 --> 44:37.644
Hmm.

44:37.678 --> 44:39.413
So, why not give them
one last thing

44:39.446 --> 44:40.614
to be proud of him for?

44:42.616 --> 44:43.617
Here.

44:48.122 --> 44:51.558
"On a film shoot

44:51.592 --> 44:55.295
in a forest in Georgia,

44:55.329 --> 45:01.068
Matt and his team
got caught in firefight.

45:06.741 --> 45:10.644
<i>He was the only one
not to panic.</i>

45:14.548 --> 45:16.250
<i>One by one,</i>

45:16.283 --> 45:19.486
<i>he made sure
all of us were safe,</i>

45:21.588 --> 45:24.224
<i>but then he realized</i>

45:24.258 --> 45:28.328
<i>the six-year-old refugee girl
was still in danger.</i>

45:28.362 --> 45:33.367
<i>Despite all of us saying it
was too dangerous to go back,</i>

45:33.400 --> 45:35.569
<i>begging him to stay.</i>

45:35.602 --> 45:39.173
<i>Yes, despite us
begging him to stay,</i>

45:39.206 --> 45:41.308
<i>Matt ran to rescue the child."</i>

45:43.243 --> 45:44.244
<i>No.</i>

45:45.245 --> 45:46.413
<i>"Children.</i>

45:51.185 --> 45:55.022
<i>Once Matt was sure
they were safe,</i>

45:55.055 --> 45:57.691
<i>he allowed his injuries
to take hold of him...</i>

46:01.261 --> 46:02.396
<i>and he died.</i>

46:09.336 --> 46:10.637
<i>His last words were..."</i>

46:11.706 --> 46:14.742
Tell Mum and Dad I love them

46:14.776 --> 46:16.210
and I'm sorry.

46:16.243 --> 46:17.244
No.

46:20.581 --> 46:24.084
<i>Tell Mum and Dad
and Peggy and Kate</i>

46:24.117 --> 46:26.019
I love them,

46:26.053 --> 46:27.521
and thank you for everything.

46:28.823 --> 46:32.025
Oh, that's a great story.

46:32.693 --> 46:33.994
I know.

46:34.929 --> 46:37.297
It's a shame
to waste it on the parents.

46:51.311 --> 46:52.546
It's a great story.

46:56.851 --> 46:59.086
Yeah. Yeah, Harry?

46:59.721 --> 47:01.154
Yeah, where are you?

47:01.856 --> 47:03.357
Okay, stay right where you are.

47:03.390 --> 47:05.292
I'm coming to you, yeah?

47:05.325 --> 47:08.095
Oh, we've got complete control
of the story.

47:08.128 --> 47:10.597
Oh, yeah. Okay, bye.

47:12.867 --> 47:15.703
The nation mourns the passing
of Matt Townsley.

47:15.737 --> 47:18.438
WNN is at the family home,
to hear Harry Hope

47:18.472 --> 47:20.173
<i>pay tribute to this brave
young man now.</i>

47:20.207 --> 47:21.843
Good evening,
ladies and gentlemen.

47:21.876 --> 47:23.811
May I present
Veronica Townsley

47:23.845 --> 47:26.446
and rock legend Harry Hope.

47:26.480 --> 47:30.284
Listen, he was...
he was so selfless. He was.

47:30.317 --> 47:32.085
It was typical of the Matt
that I knew

47:32.119 --> 47:34.488
that he died helping others.

47:34.521 --> 47:36.323
That's why in 48 hours

47:36.356 --> 47:39.426
we're putting on the world's
biggest concert for peace.

47:39.459 --> 47:41.796
<i>We need it now more than ever.</i>

47:41.829 --> 47:44.298
<i>Don't do it for me,
do it for Matt.</i>

47:44.331 --> 47:45.532
Mathaniel.

47:46.099 --> 47:48.468
He always smelled of rose

47:48.502 --> 47:50.337
and he looks like
Terrence Howard, look at him.

47:50.370 --> 47:53.440
He's got green eyes
that you can get lost in.

47:53.473 --> 47:55.843
He's got Caucasian eyes
on a black body, that's rare.

47:55.877 --> 47:57.477
Do it for him.

47:59.847 --> 48:02.750
What's he saying?
What's he saying?

48:04.451 --> 48:05.753
He says he can't get
a car to us,

48:05.787 --> 48:07.120
they've closed the roads,

48:07.154 --> 48:09.356
but if we follow the river
south to Bagero,

48:09.389 --> 48:11.558
there's a UNICEF camp,

48:11.592 --> 48:13.293
and he'll arrange transport
for us from there.

48:13.327 --> 48:15.629
Okay.

48:15.662 --> 48:17.431
Okay, we can set off
tomorrow morning

48:17.464 --> 48:20.267
and get you back
to Throop in Dorset

48:20.868 --> 48:22.636
and the farm,

48:22.669 --> 48:25.238
and you can forget
about all this.

48:25.807 --> 48:26.808
Great.

48:28.776 --> 48:30.344
Mathaniel Townsley:

48:30.377 --> 48:33.547
journalist, humanitarian, hero.

48:38.385 --> 48:40.687
Mr. Governor,
why was Mathaniel shot

48:40.722 --> 48:42.589
when he was trying
to save children?

48:44.191 --> 48:47.494
What kind of journalist wears
a military uniform?

48:48.395 --> 48:49.630
He's a spy.

48:50.732 --> 48:53.166
<i>Alleged war criminal
Matt Townsley</i>

48:53.200 --> 48:54.802
is accused of torture
and murder,

48:54.836 --> 48:56.938
as shocking pictures
emerge on the Internet.

49:03.077 --> 49:04.879
Mr. <i>Hope,</i>
<i>Matt Townsley worked for you.</i>

49:04.912 --> 49:06.246
Why was he out there?

49:06.279 --> 49:08.448
Harry, no. No. No.

49:08.482 --> 49:10.752
Okay, that's top secret
and, um,

49:10.785 --> 49:13.286
I'm not at liberty to divulge
that type of information.

49:13.320 --> 49:15.322
Was he spying
on the Ukbar military?

49:15.355 --> 49:16.724
- Yep!
- No.

49:16.758 --> 49:18.793
All right,
don't forget, people,

49:18.826 --> 49:21.194
best concert that
you ever gonna see,

49:21.228 --> 49:22.362
<i>in two days.</i>

49:22.396 --> 49:24.398
<i>For peace, right?</i>

49:26.366 --> 49:29.536
Again, this spy
is concrete evidence

49:29.569 --> 49:32.439
of British efforts
to undermine our state.

49:33.975 --> 49:36.176
The ceasefire is over.

49:37.544 --> 49:40.647
Ukbar is at war with Georgia.

49:51.558 --> 49:53.527
Harry.

49:53.560 --> 49:54.829
<i>What the hell
have you done, Kate?</i>

49:54.862 --> 49:56.329
<i>You started World War III!</i>

49:56.363 --> 49:59.399
What? No, I was just
on the toilet.

49:59.433 --> 50:00.968
I said skirmishes!

50:01.002 --> 50:03.670
You know what a skirmish is,
don't you? A skirmish?

50:03.705 --> 50:05.740
Skirmish? Can you stop
saying "skirmish"?

50:05.773 --> 50:07.441
That story that you
put out about Matt?

50:07.474 --> 50:09.944
Now America is sending
troops into Georgia.

50:09.977 --> 50:12.013
- What are you talking about?
- <i>Ground troops!</i>

50:12.046 --> 50:14.749
Boots on the ground!
It's a full-scale invasion!

50:14.782 --> 50:16.718
<i>And the Europeans
are on the other side.</i>

50:16.751 --> 50:18.920
<i>That's Americans and British,</i>

50:18.953 --> 50:21.856
<i>husbands and sons,
all fighting!</i>

50:21.889 --> 50:23.791
Nobody wants a peace
concert anymore!

50:23.825 --> 50:25.392
Everybody wants to win!

50:25.425 --> 50:26.493
Kate!

50:26.526 --> 50:28.695
<i>I'll never win
a Nobel Prize now!</i>

50:28.730 --> 50:30.998
- Come quick!
- <i>Kate! Where you going?</i>

50:31.032 --> 50:32.632
<i>You have fucked up my life,</i>

50:32.666 --> 50:34.234
and now I'm gonna fuck yours!

50:36.070 --> 50:38.472
Limo driver, pull over
and give me some head.

50:40.507 --> 50:42.576
No! No, no, no.

50:42.609 --> 50:44.779
No, no, no!

50:45.345 --> 50:46.748
No, no!

50:48.950 --> 50:51.551
No, no, no! No!

50:53.553 --> 50:55.790
No, I can't start a war!

50:56.556 --> 50:57.792
No.

50:57.825 --> 51:00.027
This is great though,
this is exactly what we wanted!

51:00.061 --> 51:02.395
Hello! Hi! No, no, no.

51:02.429 --> 51:03.497
Hi. Hello.

51:05.032 --> 51:06.701
There's been a bit of a mix-up.

51:08.069 --> 51:10.004
There's actually no war
going on.

51:11.139 --> 51:13.975
So you're not needed.
Do you mind turning around?

51:14.008 --> 51:15.642
Turn around now.

51:15.675 --> 51:17.310
Do you speak English?

51:17.344 --> 51:18.478
He doesn't even speak English.

51:22.449 --> 51:24.484
Ah, thank you.

51:24.518 --> 51:27.454
Hello. Finally,
someone in charge.

51:27.487 --> 51:29.757
Well, there's been, um,
a bit of a mix-up basically,

51:29.791 --> 51:30.892
and just a clerical error!

51:40.001 --> 51:41.836
It's okay, come on.

51:41.869 --> 51:42.937
Over here.

51:43.938 --> 51:44.972
Come on.

51:54.715 --> 51:56.316
I only sent an email.

51:57.484 --> 51:59.586
- We sent an email.
- This is ridiculous.

51:59.619 --> 52:01.621
This should not be allowed to happen.

52:01.655 --> 52:03.456
Someone should be checking
this kind of stuff.

52:03.490 --> 52:05.026
It's ridiculous
this can happen.

52:23.610 --> 52:24.611
Wow.

52:42.596 --> 52:44.464
Oh, now what?

52:47.902 --> 52:49.904
Oh... what do they want?

52:53.107 --> 52:55.442
Oh.

52:55.475 --> 52:59.080
- I think they think you're some kind of leader.
- Oh, my gosh.

53:04.484 --> 53:05.720
Um...

53:06.653 --> 53:08.588
So... Sorry, what?

53:08.622 --> 53:10.657
He says you've made him
feel very happy,

53:10.690 --> 53:12.093
and he will fight for you.

53:14.128 --> 53:16.463
Oh, no, no, no, no.

53:16.496 --> 53:17.865
No, there's no war,

53:17.899 --> 53:20.835
so go back to farming

53:20.868 --> 53:22.569
or whatever it is you do.

53:31.611 --> 53:34.547
No, he says you're the
chosen leader of the Georgian resistance.

53:36.017 --> 53:38.152
Well, I... I'm...

53:38.185 --> 53:40.721
I'm not the leader
of the resistance,

53:40.755 --> 53:43.124
I just handle publicity
and events.

53:43.157 --> 53:44.792
Um...

53:46.093 --> 53:48.930
But... see you later.

53:50.831 --> 53:52.565
- Help me get down.
- Yeah.

53:52.599 --> 53:54.601
- See you in a bit.
- Thank you.

53:54.634 --> 53:55.937
Thank you so much.

53:55.970 --> 53:57.805
- Thank you!
- Right.

53:59.040 --> 54:01.175
Run, run, run. Run.

54:02.977 --> 54:04.779
Thank you so much.

54:13.687 --> 54:15.723
Ah, I hope Manu is
true to his word,

54:15.756 --> 54:17.792
because if we get to Bagero and he's not there...

54:17.825 --> 54:19.093
...I don't know how we're
gonna get out of here.

54:19.126 --> 54:20.694
Oh, Kate.

54:20.728 --> 54:22.462
- Kate.
- Huh?

54:23.097 --> 54:25.465
Oh, for God's sake!

54:30.037 --> 54:32.073
- Shoo!
- Er, Kate. Kate.

54:32.106 --> 54:33.808
- Shoo!
- Kate!

54:33.841 --> 54:34.875
Shoo! Shoo!

54:34.909 --> 54:38.980
Kate... they could be...

54:39.013 --> 54:42.049
I dunno, they could be
kind of useful.

54:42.083 --> 54:44.684
You know, we might be able
to use them.

54:44.719 --> 54:46.686
They'll know the way to Bagero.

54:49.622 --> 54:51.826
- Bagero!
- Bagero?

54:52.927 --> 54:54.295
Fast, take us there.

54:54.328 --> 54:55.528
Yes.

54:55.863 --> 54:56.931
Great.

55:02.036 --> 55:05.006
We're watching this very
dangerous situation unfold

55:05.039 --> 55:08.142
<i>as US and European troops
prepare for all-out war.</i>

55:11.644 --> 55:12.913
- Harry.
- <i>Where the hell are you?</i>

55:12.947 --> 55:14.248
Listen, I know you sacked me

55:14.281 --> 55:16.217
and told me to go and die
in a fire,

55:16.250 --> 55:19.086
but listen, I have an idea
that might interest you.

55:21.989 --> 55:23.690
I know where Kate is.

55:28.829 --> 55:31.899
<i>You were
told not to start World War III!</i>

55:31.932 --> 55:34.068
- It's Harry Hope, sir.
- <i>Who do you think I am?</i>

55:34.101 --> 55:35.703
The pop star?

55:37.772 --> 55:39.740
- Mr. Hope.
- <i>Hi, Boris.</i>

55:39.774 --> 55:43.344
I have some information about a
propaganda campaign against you.

55:43.377 --> 55:46.914
Now, I don't know who
they're working for, but, uh,

55:46.947 --> 55:49.283
I do have their names
and last location.

55:49.316 --> 55:51.118
Why are you telling me this?

55:51.152 --> 55:52.153
If you can stop them,

55:52.186 --> 55:55.222
perhaps we can both have
the peace that we want.

55:55.256 --> 55:59.126
<i>I give her to you and in return,
we declare peace together.</i>

55:59.160 --> 56:01.929
- Go on.
- <i>Her name is Kate Hemming.</i>

56:01.962 --> 56:05.232
<i>She's outside a town called
Telavi in Georgia.</i>

56:05.266 --> 56:08.102
<i>I think a few years of POW
would do her good.</i>

56:09.669 --> 56:11.305
Thank you, Mr. Hope.

56:11.338 --> 56:13.274
I loved your last album.

56:14.375 --> 56:15.876
But not the new one.

56:19.646 --> 56:21.315
Get me the Georgians
on the phone.

56:43.170 --> 56:45.840
I've suddenly got
a massive wave of deja vu.

56:45.873 --> 56:47.607
- This place seems really familiar.
- Hmm?

56:48.175 --> 56:50.111
Oh, gosh, I'm exhausted.

56:50.144 --> 56:52.146
I could murder
a cup of tea.

56:54.815 --> 56:57.818
- Oh...
- Oh, God, we're in a warzone.

56:57.852 --> 56:59.787
What are you doing? Um...

57:01.922 --> 57:03.757
Wh... Um...

57:05.426 --> 57:06.827
Hello.

57:06.861 --> 57:08.262
Um, can we get past, please?

57:08.295 --> 57:10.064
We're trying
to head to Bagero.

57:10.097 --> 57:11.899
I think they think
we're trying to attack them.

57:15.903 --> 57:18.172
Stop, stop, stop!
Stop talking, everyone.

57:18.205 --> 57:19.206
Stop.

57:19.907 --> 57:20.908
Hi.

57:22.910 --> 57:24.078
Do you speak English?

57:24.945 --> 57:25.980
No?

57:26.013 --> 57:28.215
Hi. I'm, um...

57:28.249 --> 57:33.888
I'm the leader, uh,
of the Georgian resistance.

57:34.889 --> 57:38.826
So... queen, if you will.

57:38.859 --> 57:43.297
These people are my men,
and they will do as I say.

57:43.330 --> 57:46.167
No! Please, I'm doing my leader thing!

57:47.501 --> 57:50.070
We really need to get to Bagero,

57:50.104 --> 57:54.141
so if we put down our
weapons and declare peace,

57:54.175 --> 57:55.376
would you kindly
let us pass, please?

57:55.409 --> 57:57.444
It's really quite urgent.

57:57.478 --> 57:59.780
I'm the leader
and I declare peace.

57:59.813 --> 58:01.448
- Peace.
- Peace.

58:01.482 --> 58:03.284
No! I declare peace.

58:03.317 --> 58:04.952
Put down your fucking guns.

58:04.985 --> 58:07.221
Put your guns down
and your hands up.

58:07.254 --> 58:09.456
Gun... Put your bloody...
Put it on the fucking floor.

58:09.490 --> 58:11.158
Great. Hands up!

58:11.192 --> 58:12.359
Hands up!

58:12.393 --> 58:13.661
Guns down, hands up!

58:13.693 --> 58:16.696
See? It's a ceasefire.
They're gonna let us past. It's fine.

58:17.231 --> 58:18.732
Great.

58:18.766 --> 58:21.402
There, it's a ceasefire.

58:21.435 --> 58:22.836
How difficult was that?

58:37.952 --> 58:40.921
I think we confused peace
with surrender, you know?

58:42.423 --> 58:44.992
Can you not tell your mum
about this?

58:45.025 --> 58:46.193
She doesn't even know
that I'm here.

58:47.895 --> 58:49.797
You said she agreed to let
you come to the concert.

58:49.830 --> 58:50.864
Yeah, I lied.

58:52.099 --> 58:55.035
- Dear God.
- Yeah, I was ruthless.

58:55.069 --> 58:58.939
Anyway, you're my mum
and you said it was okay.

59:15.089 --> 59:16.156
What are they doing?

59:17.224 --> 59:18.459
Bite my blindfold.

59:22.563 --> 59:23.797
That's it.

59:26.433 --> 59:28.068
Let me see.
Let me see.

59:28.535 --> 59:30.004
Oh, come on.

59:33.073 --> 59:36.410
- Oh, what?
- They're playing football with the Georgians.

59:36.443 --> 59:39.847
It... It's like that game the British
and the Germans played in World War I.

59:39.880 --> 59:42.049
This is it. This is the
photo that can stop the war.

59:42.082 --> 59:42.916
We need to get it online.

59:42.950 --> 59:44.485
We can fake this,
we can fake a peace.

59:44.518 --> 59:45.886
Why didn't they
ask us to play?

59:45.919 --> 59:47.288
If we can fake a war,
we can fake a peace.

59:47.321 --> 59:49.156
- Where's your camera?
- I don't have a camera.

59:49.189 --> 59:51.025
- Get your camera.
- I don't have a camera!

59:51.058 --> 59:53.260
He's got a phone.
Excuse me?

59:53.294 --> 59:56.363
Can you cut our hands free?
Cut our hands free.

59:56.397 --> 59:59.500
I... If you can take photos
and put them online, I'll pay you.

59:59.533 --> 01:00:01.035
- Okay.
- I'll pay you millions.

01:00:01.068 --> 01:00:02.303
Millions.
You'll be a millionaire.

01:00:02.336 --> 01:00:04.371
Oh, Jesus fucking Christ, this is it!

01:00:04.405 --> 01:00:06.974
Get the photo. Fuck, this is
some kind of fucking torture.

01:00:07.007 --> 01:00:09.043
Did you get it?

01:00:09.076 --> 01:00:12.880
That's wonderful. Did you get it?
Show me, show me.

01:00:12.913 --> 01:00:14.948
Yes, that's it. That's the
image that's gonna stop the war.

01:00:14.982 --> 01:00:16.283
They'll demand peace.

01:00:16.317 --> 01:00:19.386
So... so tweet it.
Hashtag "Ukbar soldiers

01:00:19.420 --> 01:00:21.555
"heal world in... in... in..."

01:00:21.588 --> 01:00:22.623
- Where are we?
- Kazbegi.

01:00:22.656 --> 01:00:26.493
"Kazbegi." Er, hashtag "peace,"
hashtag "no war."

01:00:26.527 --> 01:00:28.595
Send it.
Have you sent it?

01:00:29.229 --> 01:00:31.332
Yeah? Yeah?

01:00:31.365 --> 01:00:33.867
No reception.

01:01:06.667 --> 01:01:10.471
No, no, no, no, the phone! No!

01:01:10.504 --> 01:01:12.306
- Kate!
- The phone!

01:01:12.339 --> 01:01:14.141
Kate!

01:01:14.174 --> 01:01:15.976
- Over there!
- Out my way!

01:01:19.146 --> 01:01:21.382
I'll pay you.
I'll pay you from England.

01:01:21.415 --> 01:01:23.584
- Just give it to me. I'm quite well off.
- Keep it in her hand.

01:01:23.617 --> 01:01:26.120
Oh, no!

01:01:26.153 --> 01:01:27.521
Where's the phone?

01:01:36.964 --> 01:01:39.400
Kate, come on, this way.

01:01:40.501 --> 01:01:41.502
Okay.

01:01:44.638 --> 01:01:46.440
Oh, yeah.

01:01:46.473 --> 01:01:48.575
- Oh, yeah.
- Yeah, here it goes, it's coming.

01:01:48.609 --> 01:01:51.044
- You have to rub it really hard.
- Huh?

01:01:51.078 --> 01:01:54.014
- Can you feel it?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, it's coming.

01:01:54.047 --> 01:01:55.416
- Oh, I can feel mine.
- Ooh!

01:01:55.449 --> 01:01:57.251
Ah! I've done it! Okay.

01:01:57.284 --> 01:01:59.153
Come on. Okay.

01:02:00.988 --> 01:02:03.424
Yeah, get the phone.

01:02:06.093 --> 01:02:07.361
Okay.

01:02:13.200 --> 01:02:16.003
Put the gun down!
Put it down now!

01:02:17.538 --> 01:02:18.539
And fuck off!

01:02:20.140 --> 01:02:22.176
Get in the car.
Sorry.

01:02:22.209 --> 01:02:23.310
Okay.

01:02:27.214 --> 01:02:28.482
Go, go, go, go, go, go.

01:02:36.356 --> 01:02:39.359
Oh, God, it's in
bloody gobbledygook.

01:02:39.393 --> 01:02:40.728
If I can just
upload this photo

01:02:40.762 --> 01:02:42.496
and then send it
to <i>The Guardian</i>

01:02:42.529 --> 01:02:44.298
and <i>The New York Times,</i>

01:02:44.331 --> 01:02:46.066
and we'll get it published
in a few hours,

01:02:46.099 --> 01:02:47.735
maybe before
the fighting starts.

01:02:47.769 --> 01:02:49.102
I'm gonna fake this piece.

01:02:49.136 --> 01:02:51.305
We can turn this around,
we can get the concert back on with this.

01:02:52.639 --> 01:02:54.241
What the fuck?

01:02:57.745 --> 01:03:00.113
- Was that... Was that a person? That was a person.
- Keep shooting.

01:03:00.147 --> 01:03:02.015
- At what?
- At the soldier.

01:03:03.217 --> 01:03:04.752
Do you think it killed him?

01:03:04.786 --> 01:03:06.353
- We killed him.
- He's a soldier, it doesn't count.

01:03:06.386 --> 01:03:07.421
This is war, okay?

01:03:07.454 --> 01:03:09.323
Everyone knows it's okay
to kill soldiers in a war.

01:03:09.356 --> 01:03:10.725
- That's what they're there for.
- Really?

01:03:10.758 --> 01:03:11.860
We're not stopping
at anything, okay?

01:03:11.893 --> 01:03:13.795
We're gonna fake that peace
and get that concert on.

01:03:13.828 --> 01:03:15.162
Okay.

01:03:15.195 --> 01:03:16.396
You know, I think
you can do this job.

01:03:16.430 --> 01:03:17.464
I love this job.

01:03:17.498 --> 01:03:18.565
I think you might
be better than me.

01:03:19.801 --> 01:03:21.535
Watch out, watch out.

01:04:14.454 --> 01:04:16.356
No. No, the phone.

01:04:16.390 --> 01:04:18.125
- No, leave it, leave it! It's gone, it's gone!
- Get off.

01:04:18.158 --> 01:04:20.193
- I can get it, I can get it.
- It's gone.

01:04:21.461 --> 01:04:23.798
Why didn't you look
where you were going?

01:04:23.831 --> 01:04:25.332
I was trying
to get us out safely.

01:04:25.365 --> 01:04:27.234
That phone was gonna
stop the war.

01:04:27.267 --> 01:04:29.403
That... That phone was
going to save the concert.

01:04:29.436 --> 01:04:30.738
What have I got now?
What have I got?

01:04:30.772 --> 01:04:32.172
- We can still try and...
- I've got nothing.

01:04:32.205 --> 01:04:33.841
No, you've ruined my life!

01:04:39.613 --> 01:04:40.614
Fuck.

01:05:08.843 --> 01:05:10.745
Wait. Which way?

01:05:13.347 --> 01:05:14.514
Which way did we...

01:05:15.917 --> 01:05:17.551
Which way should we...

01:05:17.584 --> 01:05:19.453
Oh, no, I... I can't.

01:05:19.486 --> 01:05:22.556
I can't fucking
take this anymore!

01:05:22.589 --> 01:05:25.158
Oh, fu...
Ow, ow, ow!

01:05:25.192 --> 01:05:27.227
Ow, ow!

01:05:27.260 --> 01:05:28.362
Ow!

01:05:30.330 --> 01:05:31.598
Oh.

01:05:33.233 --> 01:05:35.602
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

01:05:35.636 --> 01:05:38.372
I'm sorry I said
you ruined my life.

01:05:38.405 --> 01:05:39.874
- It's okay.
- No.

01:05:40.842 --> 01:05:42.576
I didn't mean it.

01:05:42.609 --> 01:05:44.478
It's just,
this has been my whole life.

01:05:44.511 --> 01:05:47.180
I've...
I've sacrificed everything.

01:05:48.215 --> 01:05:49.249
No, you haven't.

01:05:50.084 --> 01:05:52.452
I have.
I've started World War III.

01:05:52.486 --> 01:05:54.789
It's not that bad.

01:05:54.822 --> 01:05:56.623
You know, I know it's hard
for you to understand,

01:05:56.657 --> 01:05:58.592
because you've lived in the same
fucking village all your life,

01:05:58.625 --> 01:05:59.827
but this is my life!

01:06:00.895 --> 01:06:03.430
Without my job,
I have nothing.

01:06:08.301 --> 01:06:09.436
You have me.

01:06:13.775 --> 01:06:14.776
Come here.

01:06:22.917 --> 01:06:24.251
I love you.

01:06:31.525 --> 01:06:32.592
Don't move.

01:06:35.997 --> 01:06:39.299
Kate, there's a gun
in my face.

01:06:40.001 --> 01:06:41.201
Me, too.

01:06:43.004 --> 01:06:44.438
Glad it's not just me, then.

01:06:48.442 --> 01:06:50.845
<i>The soldiers
have captured Kate Hemmings.</i>

01:06:50.878 --> 01:06:53.014
<i>The handover
is in 12 hours.</i>

01:06:53.047 --> 01:06:55.783
<i>Great!
I'm coming over for the photo op.</i>

01:06:57.517 --> 01:06:58.986
<i>I'm gonna
nail this piece!</i>

01:07:01.288 --> 01:07:03.623
Hey, Boris,
I'm in Georgia.

01:07:04.391 --> 01:07:05.459
See you soon.

01:07:36.758 --> 01:07:38.658
Okay.

01:07:38.692 --> 01:07:40.027
Thank you, thank you.

01:07:40.061 --> 01:07:42.662
- This way, please.
- Er, where are we?

01:07:42.696 --> 01:07:46.067
- This is Borgero.
- Ah.

01:07:46.100 --> 01:07:49.536
- Oh, okay.
- The most heavily defended part of our border.

01:07:49.569 --> 01:07:51.638
Over there, this is Ukbar.

01:07:52.572 --> 01:07:53.573
Let's go.

01:08:06.353 --> 01:08:07.955
What is going on?

01:08:07.989 --> 01:08:10.958
Let's just do as they say.
Maybe we can get out of here, okay?

01:08:10.992 --> 01:08:14.729
I wish
we could stop this war,

01:08:14.762 --> 01:08:19.066
you know, not for Boris
or for Harry or for anyone,

01:08:19.100 --> 01:08:23.403
just 'cause
it's the right thing to do.

01:08:23.435 --> 01:08:25.907
And that's what got me so
excited about the peace concert.

01:08:27.774 --> 01:08:30.443
Well, now you realize
what it's really all about,

01:08:30.477 --> 01:08:33.080
just egos and money.

01:08:33.113 --> 01:08:36.383
Why do we have to wait for them
to tell us what to do?

01:08:36.416 --> 01:08:37.952
Well, because they've
chained us to a chair.

01:08:37.984 --> 01:08:40.687
- No, I mean in life.
- Oh.

01:08:40.720 --> 01:08:44.558
Why can't we
just stop the war for us?

01:08:45.658 --> 01:08:47.394
We're the ones
doing all the work.

01:08:48.627 --> 01:08:50.064
Why can't we just...

01:08:51.665 --> 01:08:53.567
work for ourselves
for a change?

01:08:57.705 --> 01:08:59.707
The generals
have confirmed your identity.

01:08:59.740 --> 01:09:01.075
Oh, thank God.

01:09:01.108 --> 01:09:03.044
We're gonna give you
to the Ukbars

01:09:03.077 --> 01:09:05.712
in exchange for four paratroopers
they've taken prisoner.

01:09:06.848 --> 01:09:08.448
- What?
- I know.

01:09:08.481 --> 01:09:09.549
Great news.

01:09:12.618 --> 01:09:15.388
Can... Can we talk about this?
We need to talk about this.

01:09:15.421 --> 01:09:17.591
- Kate!
- Oh, Manu! Manu, you need to help us!

01:09:17.624 --> 01:09:19.126
- I'll try to talk to someone.
- Please do something!

01:09:19.160 --> 01:09:20.127
They're handing us over
to the Ukbars.

01:09:20.161 --> 01:09:22.763
Don't be afraid, Kate!
Don't be afraid.

01:09:23.630 --> 01:09:24.765
Just her.

01:09:25.497 --> 01:09:26.666
You stay here.

01:09:26.701 --> 01:09:28.169
They wouldn't give us
anything for you.

01:09:28.202 --> 01:09:29.837
No, no, Kate.

01:09:29.871 --> 01:09:32.404
- Go, stay with Manu. Stay with Manu.
- No. Kate!

01:09:36.010 --> 01:09:36.844
We'll get you home, Peggy.

01:09:36.877 --> 01:09:38.845
I'm not going
anywhere without Kate.

01:09:40.447 --> 01:09:41.481
What's going on?

01:09:42.716 --> 01:09:44.151
What's he doing here?

01:09:44.185 --> 01:09:45.019
Oh, what the...
Hey, come on.

01:09:45.051 --> 01:09:46.854
Harry,
I'm Kate Hemmings's daughter.

01:09:46.888 --> 01:09:47.921
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

01:09:47.955 --> 01:09:49.589
Kate Hemming ain't got
no daughter.

01:09:49.622 --> 01:09:51.192
Yes, she does,
and it's me.

01:09:51.225 --> 01:09:53.493
And she's just been taken prisoner by
the Georgian army to give to the Ukbars

01:09:53.526 --> 01:09:54.862
in exchange
for some paratroopers,

01:09:54.896 --> 01:09:56.696
so you need to do
something about it now!

01:09:56.731 --> 01:10:00.167
Oh! You really
are her daughter, huh?

01:10:00.201 --> 01:10:03.436
Look at you.
Like a splitting image of her.

01:10:03.470 --> 01:10:04.571
You need to do
something about it.

01:10:04.604 --> 01:10:06.207
She's going
to no-man's-land.

01:10:06.240 --> 01:10:07.909
I'm not gonna help her.

01:10:07.942 --> 01:10:09.944
I'm the one who sold her
at the border.

01:10:12.713 --> 01:10:14.749
Oh! Argh!

01:10:14.782 --> 01:10:17.550
- My fur is on the ground. I'm not a barn animal!
- Hostage exchange!

01:10:17.584 --> 01:10:18.819
It's happening!

01:10:18.853 --> 01:10:20.988
Y'all just gonna let Pippi
Longstocking kick me in the face

01:10:21.022 --> 01:10:22.790
and you ain't gonna do
nothing about it?

01:10:22.823 --> 01:10:23.724
Okay, fine.

01:10:23.758 --> 01:10:26.093
When I get you Pepper Ann...
Pepper Ann!

01:10:26.127 --> 01:10:27.128
Pepper Ann!

01:10:28.561 --> 01:10:30.064
Kate. Kate!

01:12:30.351 --> 01:12:31.719
Is that...

01:12:38.959 --> 01:12:40.761
Is that Boris?

01:12:41.028 --> 01:12:42.229
It is!

01:12:48.736 --> 01:12:49.937
Kate Hemmings?

01:12:52.873 --> 01:12:54.842
This is all my fault.

01:12:54.875 --> 01:12:56.844
I'm so sorry.

01:12:56.877 --> 01:12:59.747
I'm the one who's been
planting fake news.

01:12:59.780 --> 01:13:02.016
Matt Townsley,
he worked for me.

01:13:02.049 --> 01:13:04.385
He wasn't a spy.
He worked for me.

01:13:04.418 --> 01:13:06.153
We both did publicity together.

01:13:06.187 --> 01:13:09.990
I... I don't work for MI6
or the CIA,

01:13:10.024 --> 01:13:14.795
I... I... I... I work for
my own PR company, Cube.

01:13:14.829 --> 01:13:16.330
Um, you might've heard of it.

01:13:17.865 --> 01:13:20.367
No? It's boutique size.

01:13:22.036 --> 01:13:25.706
We just needed a few more days
of war stories to...

01:13:26.673 --> 01:13:29.376
to not disrupt
our pathetic concert.

01:13:30.411 --> 01:13:31.979
You worked for Harry Hope.

01:13:32.012 --> 01:13:34.248
- Mm.
- You do all this for him.

01:13:36.117 --> 01:13:37.118
Mm.

01:13:39.019 --> 01:13:40.788
Okay.

01:13:40.821 --> 01:13:42.022
You work for me now.

01:13:42.056 --> 01:13:44.859
You make me famous
as Harry Hope.

01:13:44.892 --> 01:13:46.026
Yes.

01:13:46.060 --> 01:13:47.995
You work for me now.
You make me famous.

01:13:48.562 --> 01:13:50.663
I want to be like Gandhi,

01:13:51.298 --> 01:13:54.268
Mandela or the Kardashians.

01:13:54.301 --> 01:13:55.302
All the West must know me.

01:13:55.336 --> 01:13:57.972
Well, the only way to do that
is to stop a war.

01:13:59.373 --> 01:14:01.709
This is what
I have been trying to do,

01:14:01.742 --> 01:14:04.311
but you keep
screwing it up for me.

01:14:04.345 --> 01:14:06.981
Mm. Let's try it now.

01:14:07.014 --> 01:14:09.283
- What?
- We can stop the war, right now.

01:14:09.316 --> 01:14:11.684
- How?
- With the right image, you can do anything.

01:14:11.719 --> 01:14:12.987
One picture can stop the war.

01:14:14.421 --> 01:14:17.358
So, what's the image?

01:14:17.391 --> 01:14:20.728
Social networking think I'm the
leader of the Georgian resistance,

01:14:20.761 --> 01:14:23.998
so... so you get your men
to train their guns on me.

01:14:24.031 --> 01:14:25.199
I'm gonna kneel actually,
I'm gonna kneel.

01:14:34.141 --> 01:14:36.210
Kate's brokering the ceasefire
with Boris and the Georgians

01:14:36.243 --> 01:14:37.878
and she's gonna be the one
to stop the war.

01:14:37.912 --> 01:14:39.013
What?

01:14:43.083 --> 01:14:44.385
That's the image.

01:14:44.418 --> 01:14:47.454
Yeah. Then you step
between me and the guns.

01:14:47.488 --> 01:14:51.392
You help me up, we hold hands,
and raise them in the air, together.

01:14:52.326 --> 01:14:53.961
Be the hero this war needs.

01:14:58.032 --> 01:14:59.166
Put your guns on her.

01:15:13.914 --> 01:15:16.850
That two-faced, conniving bitch!

01:15:18.352 --> 01:15:19.753
Give me that!

01:15:19.787 --> 01:15:22.256
- Hey, relax, man.
- Thanks, mate!

01:15:22.289 --> 01:15:23.791
Hey!

01:15:24.592 --> 01:15:27.394
Well, I guess
the jig is up, huh?

01:15:27.428 --> 01:15:28.929
Excuse me, gentlemen.

01:15:34.501 --> 01:15:36.403
Hey! Stop!

01:15:36.437 --> 01:15:38.138
Harry, stop!

01:15:38.172 --> 01:15:39.940
That's a minefield!

01:15:39.974 --> 01:15:41.408
Wait for me, you fuck...

01:15:42.142 --> 01:15:43.277
Wait for me!

01:15:44.378 --> 01:15:45.813
Don't do anything without...

01:15:47.314 --> 01:15:48.549
- Wait for me!
- Picture.

01:15:49.917 --> 01:15:51.118
Don't smile too much.

01:15:55.456 --> 01:15:57.358
Don't shoot anything without me!

01:15:57.391 --> 01:15:58.826
Wait for me!

01:15:58.859 --> 01:15:59.927
Wait for me!

01:16:05.199 --> 01:16:06.333
Don't take another pic...

01:16:12.306 --> 01:16:13.907
Was that...

01:16:13.941 --> 01:16:15.209
Was that Harry Hope?

01:16:18.445 --> 01:16:19.446
Yeah.

01:16:20.981 --> 01:16:22.149
Oh, my God.

01:16:24.351 --> 01:16:25.586
He's dead.

01:16:25.619 --> 01:16:27.221
Harry Hope is dead?

01:16:30.424 --> 01:16:33.193
Son of a bitch
literally photobombed me.

01:16:39.967 --> 01:16:42.936
<i>Harry Hope
dedicated his life to securing peace.</i>

01:16:42.970 --> 01:16:46.140
Harry Hope dedicated
his life to securing peace.

01:16:46.173 --> 01:16:48.108
<i>No one person
did more to...</i>

01:16:48.142 --> 01:16:49.176
No one person...

01:16:49.209 --> 01:16:50.477
...bring attention
to our region.

01:16:50.511 --> 01:16:53.080
...did more to bring attention
to our region.

01:16:53.113 --> 01:16:55.983
In Harry's memory,
I declare a ceasefire.

01:16:56.016 --> 01:16:59.320
And in Harry's memory,
I declare

01:16:59.353 --> 01:17:01.322
a ceasefire!

01:17:07.161 --> 01:17:10.964
And promise lifelong peace

01:17:10.998 --> 01:17:13.967
between our two countries!

01:17:15.969 --> 01:17:19.973
Harry sacrificed his life

01:17:20.007 --> 01:17:21.041
for peace.

01:17:22.476 --> 01:17:23.610
It gives me

01:17:24.411 --> 01:17:27.114
great honor to accept

01:17:27.147 --> 01:17:29.083
on his behalf,

01:17:29.116 --> 01:17:31.952
the Nobel Prize for Peace,

01:17:31.985 --> 01:17:34.588
for Harry Hope, posthumously.

01:17:35.189 --> 01:17:36.557
Tears.

01:17:41.495 --> 01:17:43.630
Turn.

01:17:43.664 --> 01:17:46.900
Tactile body language,
tactile body language.

01:17:50.003 --> 01:17:51.505
Music.

01:17:54.608 --> 01:17:57.044
<i>♪ Somebody's crying, Lord ♪</i>

01:17:57.077 --> 01:17:58.212
Flag.

01:17:58.245 --> 01:18:01.115
<i>♪ Kumbaya ♪</i>

01:18:01.148 --> 01:18:02.149
Yeah!

01:18:02.950 --> 01:18:04.051
Yeah!

01:18:05.285 --> 01:18:08.122
Yeah! Yeah!

01:18:08.155 --> 01:18:10.657
<i>♪ Somebody's crying ♪</i>

01:18:10.691 --> 01:18:12.059
Yeah!

01:18:12.092 --> 01:18:15.529
<i>♪ Kumbaya ♪</i>

01:18:15.562 --> 01:18:18.966
<i>♪ Somebody's praying, Lord ♪</i>

01:18:18.999 --> 01:18:22.136
<i>♪ Kumbaya... ♪</i>

01:18:25.639 --> 01:18:27.674
That's it. I'm done.
I quit this job.

01:18:27.709 --> 01:18:29.576
- What? No, I'm just getting started.
- No, I mean it.

01:18:29.610 --> 01:18:31.645
No, no, no, I wanna go back
to Throop in Dorset.

01:18:31.678 --> 01:18:35.649
I wanna have chickens,
and... and weave...

01:18:35.682 --> 01:18:38.585
Do stuff with my hands,
herb gardens, clay.

01:18:38.619 --> 01:18:40.421
I'm not
going back to Throop.

01:18:40.454 --> 01:18:41.955
I'm doing this forever.

01:18:41.989 --> 01:18:43.390
What are you
talking about?

01:18:43.424 --> 01:18:45.325
You saw what happened
to Harry.

01:18:45.359 --> 01:18:47.027
I didn't see it, I did it.

01:18:48.562 --> 01:18:50.297
Sorry, what?

01:18:50.330 --> 01:18:51.632
Yeah, I sent him
over the landmine.

01:18:54.101 --> 01:18:55.202
You did what?

01:18:55.870 --> 01:18:57.237
They had a gun to your head.

01:18:57.271 --> 01:18:58.605
I had to do something.

01:18:58.639 --> 01:19:02.443
So I told him you were signing
the peace treaty, and he flipped.

01:19:02.476 --> 01:19:04.344
And I knew
it wouldn't stop anything.

01:19:04.378 --> 01:19:07.448
Oh, God, you set him up?

01:19:07.481 --> 01:19:10.083
Initiative,
initiative, initiative.

01:19:10.117 --> 01:19:11.318
What have I done to you?

01:19:11.351 --> 01:19:12.686
Oh, relax.

01:19:12.720 --> 01:19:15.355
The concert still went ahead, didn't it?

01:19:18.625 --> 01:19:20.360
Peggy Hemmings.

01:19:20.394 --> 01:19:23.765
Hi! Hi, yeah, thank you.

01:19:23.798 --> 01:19:25.499
- It's the White House.
- What?

01:19:25.532 --> 01:19:27.267
Oh, yeah.

01:19:27.301 --> 01:19:28.402
Oh, thank you.

01:19:28.435 --> 01:19:29.704
- Yeah, that's really flattering.
- Let me talk to them.

01:19:29.737 --> 01:19:32.506
No, I'm not interested,
I'm not doing this stuff anymore.

01:19:32.539 --> 01:19:33.741
They're offering us a job.

01:19:33.775 --> 01:19:36.143
Oh, yeah, no, we're really proud
of that campaign, thank you.

01:19:36.176 --> 01:19:37.644
Is it another campaign?

01:19:37.678 --> 01:19:39.680
- Oh, no, we... Of course...
- What are they saying about the campaign?

01:19:39.714 --> 01:19:41.615
...we'd love to be part
of the president's house.

01:19:41.648 --> 01:19:44.351
We could go to Dorset
for a... a couple of weeks,

01:19:44.384 --> 01:19:47.789
and then...
Or a week, a weekend,

01:19:47.822 --> 01:19:50.190
and then we'd go
for a few hours,

01:19:50.224 --> 01:19:53.460
and then we'll, er, get
the plane to Washington D.C.

01:19:53.494 --> 01:19:55.462
We're going to Hawaii.

01:19:55.496 --> 01:19:56.597
Have you been to Hawaii?

01:19:57.664 --> 01:19:59.433
Get a nice tan.

01:19:59.466 --> 01:20:01.134
The White House.

01:20:01.836 --> 01:20:03.537
That's exciting.
