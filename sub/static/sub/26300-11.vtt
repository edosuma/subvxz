Oh, and I don't?

08:07.355 --> 08:09.815
No, you tried to come for me, baby girl.

08:09.895 --> 08:11.435
But you can't compete.

08:11.460 --> 08:14.182
- Or you don't compare.
- Mm.

SIMONE: We are here today so Atlanta

08:30.665 --> 08:32.544
can be a safe place for immigrants.

08:32.625 --> 08:34.395
And we believe a vote
can help with that.

08:34.421 --> 08:36.716
Gravity Media and Karma
are partnering together

08:36.741 --> 08:39.591
to create a fund-raiser to
raise awareness about the issue.

08:39.623 --> 08:40.982
Councilman, we'd like you to come.

08:41.018 --> 08:43.727
This council appreciates
all voices of the community,

08:43.753 --> 08:47.053
but honestly, I sense
an ulterior motive.

08:47.078 --> 08:49.306
Sir, social justice is our motive.

08:49.361 --> 08:51.861
I hear you're about to film a movie.

08:51.911 --> 08:55.491
I'm pulling away from that so
I can focus on making Atlanta

08:55.531 --> 08:57.541
- a sanctuary city.
- With a nightclub performance?

08:59.581 --> 09:03.171
This issue is personal to me.

09:03.211 --> 09:05.675
My husband was deported
from the only country

09:05.700 --> 09:07.551
that he's ever known, and I want action.

09:07.671 --> 09:09.131
I want to help people.

09:09.221 --> 09:11.761
Both sides of this issue
want to help people.

09:11.801 --> 09:13.839
Half of this city is living
in fear that immigrants

09:13.864 --> 09:15.059
are going to take what's theirs.

09:15.083 --> 09:16.777
The other half lives in fear

09:16.802 --> 09:18.642
that we're changing the Open Door Policy

09:18.722 --> 09:20.602
that this country was built on.

09:20.682 --> 09:22.482
Please be specific.

09:24.692 --> 09:27.295
The real issue is that
this council has delayed

09:27.320 --> 09:28.982
a sanctuary city vote for years.

09:29.007 --> 09:31.442
- It's about time.

will you push up the vote?

09:37.422 --> 09:40.002
This was a waste of our time.
This meeting is adjourned.

09:40.542 --> 09:42.752
A waste of time?

09:42.792 --> 09:44.188
There's families
fighting to stay together.

09:44.212 --> 09:46.422
There's children being ripped
away from their parents.

- Can I hold him?
- Yeah.

- I need some Davis time.
- Of course.

I got Davis to think about, you know?

is like money in the banks

MATEO: Councilman.

37:41.556 --> 37:43.686
My performance has gone viral.

37:43.711 --> 37:45.671

I'll see what we can do.

37:50.609 --> 37:52.689
Next up, prison reform.

37:54.579 --> 37:57.430

- She means every word.

37:57.455 --> 37:59.795
Councilman, I want to talk
to you about something.

37:59.820 --> 38:02.819
Xander McPherson is
in the running to land

38:02.844 --> 38:05.014
that real estate project on Peachtree.

38:07.095 --> 38:08.975
Consider this an added endorsement.

38:09.000 --> 38:11.000

38:13.105 --> 38:15.645
Good seeing you.

38:15.725 --> 38:17.895

I came to apologize.

38:40.730 --> 38:42.722
You didn't vandalize Gravity Records.

38:42.747 --> 38:44.877
GiGi's crazy-ass family
just admitted to it.

38:45.448 --> 38:46.868

38:48.798 --> 38:50.565

38:50.589 --> 38:52.049

39:18.165 --> 39:19.795
CASSIE: Mm.

39:19.820 --> 39:21.570
I really messed that up.

39:21.595 --> 39:23.175
She's the best woman I've ever had.

I mean, my ex was nothing but trash,

39:31.377 --> 39:33.627
and I wasted years chasing after him.

39:34.435 --> 39:36.765
I think you mentioned that.

39:37.364 --> 39:41.264
You know, you think we...
we just be aiming too high?

39:42.668 --> 39:45.508
I don't think I've aimed high enough.

Tonight.

41:08.620 --> 41:10.620
See, you proved yourself.

41:10.645 --> 41:13.235
But I've been proving myself for years.
