00:00.679 --> 00:02.311
Previously on The Following...

00:02.675 --> 00:05.716
Serial killer Joe Carroll
has escaped from prison.

00:05.851 --> 00:07.051
Get some help now!

00:07.164 --> 00:09.213
Ryan, I know
things didn't end well with the Bureau,

00:09.327 --> 00:10.435
but you caught Carroll.

00:10.537 --> 00:11.662
No one knows him like you do.

00:11.751 --> 00:12.865
I'm not an agent anymore.

00:12.977 --> 00:14.493
He cut out his victims' eyes as a nod

00:14.618 --> 00:15.966
to his favorite works of Poe.

00:16.072 --> 00:18.013
He didn't just
eviscerate 14 female students.

00:18.123 --> 00:19.051
He was making art.

00:19.176 --> 00:20.581
Sarah was his unfinished work.

00:20.678 --> 00:21.840
He wanted to get the ending right.

00:21.953 --> 00:24.992
The point of Sarah's death was for you.

00:25.101 --> 00:26.139
He's finding people.

00:26.252 --> 00:27.405
They're his followers.

00:27.514 --> 00:28.853
Prison guard,
gay neighbors--

00:28.957 --> 00:30.913
how do they figure into your new plot?

00:31.011 --> 00:31.939
We know about the cult.

00:32.040 --> 00:33.978
I like to think of them as my friends.

00:34.070 --> 00:35.502
So what's my sequel about, Joe?

00:35.604 --> 00:37.019
We're gonna write this together, Ryan,

00:37.126 --> 00:39.430
even though you slept with my wife.

00:39.527 --> 00:40.528
Did she show you the letter?

00:40.635 --> 00:41.645
- How does he know?
- He doesn't.

00:41.758 --> 00:42.725
No one need to know about this.

00:42.836 --> 00:44.798
- Mom, what's going on?
- Yeah.

00:44.960 --> 00:46.049
It's dad, isn't it?

00:46.158 --> 00:47.751
- I didn't know what to say.
- Oh, honey.

00:47.875 --> 00:49.725
If this book ends with
anything other than your death,

00:49.837 --> 00:51.527
you better plan on a rewrite.

00:51.668 --> 00:52.871
Aah! Aah!

00:52.969 --> 00:53.934
Joey? Where is he?

00:54.036 --> 00:55.936
Joey! Joey, honey,
where are you?

00:56.042 --> 00:58.144
Where's Denise?
Where's my son?!

00:59.355 --> 01:01.101
Sorry. Didn't mean
to scare you.

01:01.351 --> 01:02.873
Is everything ok?

01:02.973 --> 01:04.289
Extra patrol this evening.

01:04.411 --> 01:05.609
I thought they caught him.

01:05.703 --> 01:06.674
I saw it on the news.

01:06.808 --> 01:07.712
Still, mind if I look around,

01:07.814 --> 01:08.857
check your doors and windows?

01:08.963 --> 01:10.194
Sure.

01:12.525 --> 01:13.717
Come on in.

01:14.043 --> 01:15.803
I think everyone's asleep.

01:16.142 --> 01:18.434
_

01:18.541 --> 01:20.269
Why don't we start upstairs?

01:25.499 --> 01:26.761
Do you want me to wake everyone?

01:26.894 --> 01:28.710
No. We don't want
to do that.

01:28.812 --> 01:31.055
Let's start with the room on the end.

01:31.293 --> 01:32.558
Ok.

01:39.758 --> 01:41.933
This is Jesse's room. She's out.

01:42.037 --> 01:45.246
Yes. Jesse's room.
I know.

01:47.406 --> 01:49.246
I've studied this house a lot.

01:51.000 --> 01:57.074

02:00.731 --> 02:02.190
What is that?

02:02.999 --> 02:05.117
I threw this up here earlier.

02:05.988 --> 02:07.586
It's my kit.

02:08.108 --> 02:11.304
It's important to have the right tools.

02:14.487 --> 02:16.908
I've been planning
this for a long time.

02:23.104 --> 02:25.375
Convicted serial killer Joe Carroll

02:25.498 --> 02:27.171
has been captured and is being held

02:27.278 --> 02:29.373
at the Richmond
Federal Detention Center.

02:29.527 --> 02:32.388
As of early this morning,
Carroll's son Joey Matthews

02:32.511 --> 02:34.930
and his nanny Denise Harris
have been missing.

02:35.096 --> 02:36.780
An amber alert is in effect,

02:36.904 --> 02:39.862
and we ask that anyone
with any information

02:39.986 --> 02:43.023
as to their whereabouts
please contact the FBI.

02:43.132 --> 02:45.246
What's going on, Ryan?
Where is my son?

02:45.377 --> 02:46.537
We need to talk.

02:46.641 --> 02:48.306
Why is Joe doing this?

02:48.447 --> 02:49.922
I don't understand how
Denise is involved.

02:50.018 --> 02:51.367
Are they gonna hurt Joey?

02:52.187 --> 02:54.577
I think she's your nanny
because of Joe.

02:54.683 --> 02:55.494
I think he put
her here--

02:55.599 --> 02:56.798
No. That's
impossible.

02:56.983 --> 02:58.963
She's been Joey's nanny for two years.

02:59.087 --> 03:00.560
She lives with me, I know her.

03:01.122 --> 03:04.193
The accomplices, the guys that
helped him kill Sarah Fuller,

03:04.302 --> 03:05.459
they were there for years,

03:05.640 --> 03:06.761
using false identities.

03:06.891 --> 03:08.144
We think that she did, too.

03:08.254 --> 03:09.887
I did a background check,

03:10.010 --> 03:12.051
I checked her references,
I have records.

03:12.167 --> 03:13.139
Can I see them?

03:13.253 --> 03:14.483
Yeah.

03:19.331 --> 03:21.681
Heavy traces of Zolpidem
on the kitchen counter.

03:21.824 --> 03:22.747
She drugged the guards.

03:22.863 --> 03:23.937
I bet the kid, too.

03:24.042 --> 03:25.875
Carried him down the back
staircase to the garage.

03:25.980 --> 03:27.160
Car was found 10 minutes ago

03:27.284 --> 03:29.100
in a parking lot 45 minutes from here.

03:35.318 --> 03:37.098
Denise Harris from Alexandria.

03:37.210 --> 03:39.702
Her address, her references,
it's all there.

03:40.035 --> 03:41.428
She talked about her mom a lot.

03:41.586 --> 03:42.919
I guess they were close.

03:43.088 --> 03:44.048
No dad in the picture.

03:44.172 --> 03:45.281
You ever meet any of her friends

03:45.397 --> 03:46.754
or overhear a phone conversation?

03:46.877 --> 03:48.643
Her friends never came over.
She was shy,

03:48.807 --> 03:50.117
she kept to herself.

03:50.649 --> 03:53.364
She read in her room a lot.

03:55.344 --> 03:57.027
I can't be this blind, can I?

03:57.158 --> 03:59.865
You cannot afford to think
like that, do you understand?

04:01.733 --> 04:03.290
Find my son.

04:15.923 --> 04:17.572
Hey! You can't
run from me!

04:22.211 --> 04:24.908
Ha ha ha! Whee!

04:25.132 --> 04:26.339
Err!

04:27.105 --> 04:28.856
I got you!

04:30.735 --> 04:32.048
Look at this place.

04:39.182 --> 04:40.618
Wow!

04:41.043 --> 04:42.365
Whose house is this?

04:42.496 --> 04:43.517
Friend of a friend.

04:43.638 --> 04:44.861
And it's ok that we're here?

04:44.966 --> 04:48.111
Yeah. Come on!
Let's check it out!

04:50.163 --> 04:51.885
Can I call my mom now?

04:52.001 --> 04:55.350
Honey, I told you.

04:55.718 --> 04:57.786
Your mom told us not to call.

04:57.926 --> 05:00.008
She doesn't want anyone
to know where we are.

05:00.630 --> 05:02.345
You remember what I said?

05:02.458 --> 05:03.669
We're on an adventure!

05:03.775 --> 05:05.977
Mm-hmm. Come here.

05:08.749 --> 05:09.869
What's wrong with you?

05:09.977 --> 05:11.403
- I hate kids.
- Stop it.

05:11.488 --> 05:12.489
I do. I hate
talking to them,

05:12.601 --> 05:13.394
I hate looking at them.

05:13.500 --> 05:15.380
Hey. Not
this kid, ok?

05:15.593 --> 05:17.249
You like this kid.

05:17.686 --> 05:20.223
Just keep saying it over and
over again until it sticks.

05:20.324 --> 05:21.613
I'd rather snap his neck.

05:24.398 --> 05:25.793
I'm kidding.

05:30.545 --> 05:31.444
Is there a problem?

05:31.566 --> 05:33.109
Nope. No. Not here.

05:33.258 --> 05:34.926
We're on an adventure with a kid,

05:35.187 --> 05:38.197
and I like kids, especially this kid.

05:44.461 --> 05:45.655
What was that about?

05:46.564 --> 05:50.026
It's been a long night, he's tired.

05:58.555 --> 06:00.284
It's good to have you back.

06:00.862 --> 06:03.000
_

06:03.115 --> 06:04.914
More developments
from Richmond, Virginia,

06:05.035 --> 06:06.854
upon Sarah Fuller's death as the search

06:06.979 --> 06:09.014
for young Joey Matthews continues.

06:09.156 --> 06:11.147
Convicted serial killer
Joe Carroll's son

06:11.254 --> 06:12.650
is believed to have been abducted...

06:12.752 --> 06:14.571
Ok. The team over there's
covering the ground search,

06:14.743 --> 06:16.469
that group is
on our prison guard Jordy,

06:16.578 --> 06:18.173
and we've got Joey's search right here.

06:18.598 --> 06:20.952
Ryan Hardy, this is Agent
Mitchell, Cyberforensics.

06:21.082 --> 06:22.770
She's from our DC office.
She's awesome.

06:22.917 --> 06:24.006
Nice to meet you, sir.

06:24.114 --> 06:25.164
Where are we are on the nanny?

06:25.285 --> 06:26.695
I know Denise Harris
is not from Alexandria

06:26.823 --> 06:28.797
because Denise Harris does not exist.

06:28.902 --> 06:31.870
But we IDed Sarah Fuller's
gay or not-so-gay neighbors.

06:31.983 --> 06:34.177
Real names are Jacob Wells
and Paul Torres.

06:34.325 --> 06:35.506
Jacob is from Lake Whitehurst,

06:35.628 --> 06:37.013
Paul is form El Paso, Texas.

06:37.121 --> 06:38.896
Where he's a computer consultant
with a history of fraud,

06:38.988 --> 06:40.661
which explains all the fake IDs.

06:40.783 --> 06:42.104
Where's Agent Mason?

06:50.184 --> 06:52.207
I'd just get rid of him, send him home.

06:52.584 --> 06:54.552
You can't. You heard Carroll.
He's part of the story.

06:54.665 --> 06:56.080
Then sideline him before he cracks

06:56.197 --> 06:57.360
because he will crack.

06:57.472 --> 07:00.125
You weren't around
10 years ago. I lived... it.

07:04.181 --> 07:06.982
Well, this is awkward.

07:07.721 --> 07:08.815
Hello, Mr. Hardy.

07:08.942 --> 07:09.934
I'm Agent Debra Parker.

07:10.041 --> 07:11.395
I'm new the party.

07:11.518 --> 07:14.885
We were just, uh, discussing you.

07:14.980 --> 07:17.478
Agent Parker's in from Quantico.
She's taking the lead.

07:17.575 --> 07:18.721
I want to speak to
Mr. Hardy privately.

07:18.813 --> 07:19.666
Where's Mason?

07:19.772 --> 07:21.173
She's on her way back to Quantico.

07:21.359 --> 07:23.693
Apparently she put a former agent alone

07:23.791 --> 07:24.848
in a room with Joe Carroll

07:24.960 --> 07:26.474
and let him break 3 of his fingers.

07:26.735 --> 07:28.704
Turns out
that's a no-no.

07:29.110 --> 07:29.894
3, huh?

07:30.022 --> 07:31.829
Marshal Turner thinks
I should dismiss you,

07:31.972 --> 07:33.699
but he's remembering you for
the man you were 10 years ago,

07:33.801 --> 07:34.867
not the man you are now.

07:35.019 --> 07:36.002
And there's a difference?

07:36.125 --> 07:38.187
I hope so because Joe Carroll

07:38.299 --> 07:40.441
has cast you as the main
character in his psycho sequel,

07:40.553 --> 07:42.458
so I can't just kick you to the curb.

07:45.151 --> 07:47.163
I'm sorry about Sarah Fuller.

07:48.597 --> 07:50.163
I want a gun.

07:50.305 --> 07:51.594
I'm not asking to be an agent again,

07:51.697 --> 07:53.802
but you need to deputize me
and give me a gun.

07:53.915 --> 07:55.511
When was the last time you had a drink?

07:56.058 --> 07:58.213
Director Franklin asked me to be here,

07:58.337 --> 08:00.136
and if I'm gonna stay, I want a gun.

08:00.248 --> 08:01.409
I'll take it under advisement.

08:01.511 --> 08:02.851
How's your heart?
I see here you suffer

08:02.956 --> 08:04.421
from, uh, cardiomyopathy.

08:04.533 --> 08:06.616
Is this really
the best use of our time?

08:06.729 --> 08:07.595
There's a child missing.

08:07.711 --> 08:09.247
So tell me about Carroll's accomplices.

08:13.358 --> 08:16.339
He used this prison guard to
gain access to the internet

08:16.456 --> 08:18.530
to create a following, like a cult.

08:18.635 --> 08:20.389
Let's not use that word.
People don't hear it well.

08:20.500 --> 08:21.660
Well, you can call it what you want,

08:21.768 --> 08:23.391
but he solicited people
to do his bidding.

08:23.497 --> 08:25.535
Carroll mentioned a letter?

08:31.384 --> 08:35.222
Claire Matthews received a letter
about a week before Carroll's escape.

08:35.337 --> 08:36.717
It was personal.

08:38.292 --> 08:40.136
He questioned my relationship with her.

08:40.241 --> 08:42.381
As did the FBI 8 years ago.

08:43.780 --> 08:45.853
So now you're up to speed.

08:47.582 --> 08:49.029
We got more bodies.

08:51.766 --> 08:54.110
Blood smear.
Jordy was messy.

08:54.246 --> 08:55.542
Left prints everywhere.

08:55.644 --> 08:57.828
Made no attempt
to conceal his identity.

08:57.947 --> 09:01.785
Victim number 3-- she tried
to run, quick struggle.

09:01.895 --> 09:03.507
Not the case for the others.

09:09.271 --> 09:11.210
There were 9 girls
in the house at the time.

09:11.328 --> 09:12.847
Some of them woke up when
they heard the screams,

09:12.963 --> 09:14.945
and Jordy ran.

09:15.039 --> 09:17.050
He removed the eyes--
Carroll's signature.

09:17.167 --> 09:18.785
Is Jordy playing
at Poe's greatest hits?

09:18.899 --> 09:20.126
It's paying homage to Carroll.

09:20.227 --> 09:22.500
It's following in the
footsteps of his hero,

09:22.611 --> 09:25.083
it's ceremonial,
the work of an acolyte.

09:25.182 --> 09:26.693
Let's not use that word either.

09:26.810 --> 09:28.063
It implies the other word.

09:28.158 --> 09:29.725
Let's say,
"Carroll's accomplices."

09:29.827 --> 09:34.231
Pick a word, any word, but
this is mind control at work.

09:34.353 --> 09:35.391
Why have his son kidnapped?

09:35.488 --> 09:36.992
It's an offering, it's biblical.

09:37.099 --> 09:38.661
They think of him as the son of God,

09:38.782 --> 09:41.233
something to be worshiped.

09:41.347 --> 09:42.900
Or sacrificed.

09:43.365 --> 09:44.992
Carroll knows where the kid is.

09:45.092 --> 09:46.079
He's not gonna tell us.

09:46.210 --> 09:48.414
But he might tell his wife.

09:48.944 --> 09:50.172
Carroll asked to see her.

09:50.275 --> 09:52.481
He's smarter than that.
He's not gonna tell her anything.

09:52.599 --> 09:54.237
Well, let's find out.

09:58.598 --> 10:00.215
What do I say?

10:00.996 --> 10:02.641
Is there anything special
I need to ask him?

10:02.835 --> 10:04.818
Try to engage him about Joey,

10:05.610 --> 10:07.758
speak to his paternal instincts.

10:07.865 --> 10:09.642
Make Joey important to him.

10:12.770 --> 10:14.526
Are you sure you want to do this?

10:34.765 --> 10:36.356
I like your new place.

10:36.486 --> 10:37.972
Me, too.

10:38.427 --> 10:39.801
How was court today?

10:39.910 --> 10:41.645
Moving fast.
Won't be long now.

10:41.748 --> 10:44.248
I can't go anymore.
I can't look at him.

10:46.545 --> 10:48.660
I don't ever want to see him again.

10:50.672 --> 10:52.570
You don't have to.

11:32.268 --> 11:34.082
My hands are shaking.

11:34.479 --> 11:37.268
My God.
You still have that effect on me.

11:37.545 --> 11:38.829
You're so beautiful
always--

11:38.946 --> 11:40.457
Where's my son?

11:42.961 --> 11:44.657
Our son, Claire.

11:44.766 --> 11:48.367
Please, Joe.
Where is he?

11:49.814 --> 11:52.415
Do you remember when
we went to Antigua,

11:53.293 --> 11:56.790
we rented that little
cottage on the beach?

11:56.898 --> 11:58.596
We were only supposed to
be there for a few days,

11:58.739 --> 12:00.213
but it turned into a whole month.

12:00.338 --> 12:02.503
I don't think we wore
clothes the entire time.

12:02.599 --> 12:05.255
He's growing up
so fast-- Joey is.

12:05.383 --> 12:08.886
He's so brilliant, reading
well beyond his years--

12:09.010 --> 12:10.239
Melville and Twain.

12:10.352 --> 12:11.796
He finished "Robinson
Crusoe" last week,

12:11.922 --> 12:12.971
but he didn't like it very much.

12:13.091 --> 12:14.782
It must be so hard for you.

12:15.750 --> 12:18.003
You must feel so betrayed.

12:19.787 --> 12:21.226
Again.

12:22.986 --> 12:25.951
Come on, Claire.
Hang in there.

12:29.978 --> 12:32.536
So you...
got my letter.

12:32.676 --> 12:34.194
Is he in danger, Joe?

12:35.652 --> 12:37.105
Please just let him be, ok, ok?

12:37.213 --> 12:38.070
Please don't let him be hurt.

12:38.181 --> 12:40.376
I'd like some answers to my questions.

12:47.922 --> 12:49.121
Tell me where Joey is first.

12:49.245 --> 12:52.524
I asked you some very
specific questions.

12:52.636 --> 12:53.766
I'd like you to answer them.

12:53.875 --> 12:56.673
- Yes.
- "Yes," you what?

12:59.707 --> 13:03.194
Ryan and I had an affair
for almost two months.

13:06.780 --> 13:08.205
After the trial?

13:08.380 --> 13:09.407
And the divorce.

13:09.515 --> 13:10.952
Oh, yes. Of course.

13:11.068 --> 13:13.369
You waited for the divorce.

13:13.480 --> 13:17.078
Noble Claire.
Only a proper little diddle will do.

13:17.892 --> 13:21.247
Was it good, the sex?

13:21.358 --> 13:24.433
Did you body quiver to his every touch?

13:27.469 --> 13:29.176
Yes.

13:29.806 --> 13:31.186
It did.

13:31.336 --> 13:32.426
We got to get her out of there.

13:32.531 --> 13:33.810
Not yet.

13:34.895 --> 13:36.031
And the last question?

13:36.145 --> 13:37.306
- I don't know.
- Oh, you know the question.

13:37.423 --> 13:40.661
I don't know is my answer.

13:41.948 --> 13:43.668
How could I love anyone after you?

13:43.777 --> 13:46.380
You destroyed me.
You son of a bitch!

13:46.491 --> 13:48.945
Where's my son?
Where is Joey, you bastard?

13:49.053 --> 13:51.428
Where is--
ohh! Aah!

13:51.526 --> 13:52.698
We need to get
in there. Damn it!

13:52.818 --> 13:55.033
I will always love you.

13:57.965 --> 13:59.442
No! Off!

14:15.635 --> 14:16.838
You ok?

14:16.962 --> 14:18.103
Yes.

14:18.659 --> 14:20.354
I'm sorry about what I said in there.

14:20.973 --> 14:23.161
Don't be. Got a car
waiting to take--

14:23.280 --> 14:24.753
Is there any news on Joey?

14:26.605 --> 14:29.073
As soon as I know anything,
I promise--

14:30.279 --> 14:31.885
we're gonna find him, Claire.

14:40.458 --> 14:41.935
Which room do I get?

14:42.059 --> 14:43.691
I don't know.
Let's see.

14:46.148 --> 14:49.353
Whoa! It's just like
my room at home!

14:49.462 --> 14:51.279
My ninja warrior!

14:51.574 --> 14:52.930
And it's brand-new!

14:53.049 --> 14:54.124
How cool is that?

14:54.276 --> 14:55.721
Supercool!

14:56.071 --> 14:57.619
Can I call mom now?

14:57.733 --> 15:01.325
Honey, she asked us not to call.

15:01.638 --> 15:03.146
We have to wait.

15:03.262 --> 15:05.681
Why is my dad such a bad man?

15:07.608 --> 15:09.543
Oh, honey.

15:11.552 --> 15:12.641
Come here.

15:17.041 --> 15:21.565
Maybe he's not so bad.

15:22.373 --> 15:25.026
Maybe we just don't understand him.

15:27.110 --> 15:29.989
I'll tell you what,
why don't you get settled

15:30.132 --> 15:32.496
and check out all your new things?

15:36.274 --> 15:38.983
"Good and bad no longer existed.

15:39.552 --> 15:42.324
It was all degrees of evil now.

15:42.783 --> 15:45.358
Gwendolyn held his dying body

15:45.735 --> 15:49.183
as the storm raged on.

15:49.339 --> 15:51.589
Death had finally arrived,

15:52.356 --> 15:56.746
and it was glorious
to the touch."

16:02.604 --> 16:04.736
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

16:08.462 --> 16:10.440
Thank you for coming, uh...

16:10.808 --> 16:14.102
Emma. I loved
your book.

16:14.217 --> 16:16.227
So you're the one, Emma.

16:17.565 --> 16:21.018
It's beautiful.
All the imagery's so vivid.

16:21.124 --> 16:23.085
I felt like I was there.

16:23.237 --> 16:26.489
Oh. You just
made my day.

16:27.499 --> 16:29.940
Uh, may I just, uh--

16:33.803 --> 16:36.076
you have such lovely eyes, Emma.

16:36.204 --> 16:37.645
Don't deprive us of them.

16:42.341 --> 16:44.627
Did she die--
Gwendolyn-- at the end

16:44.727 --> 16:47.557
when she went into the sea and
started swimming to the horizon?

16:47.668 --> 16:49.307
Well, you tell me.

16:49.913 --> 16:51.676
I think she died.

16:51.825 --> 16:56.391
She was swimming toward the
horizon, toward the Sun.

16:57.710 --> 17:00.169
In death, she found hope.

17:01.423 --> 17:03.558
Emma, hon.
You almost done?

17:03.659 --> 17:05.321
- I'm ready, mom--
- Oh.

17:05.435 --> 17:07.922
So this is the fella you came to see.

17:08.060 --> 17:11.262
My, my. I thought all writers
were big-nosed and mushy.

17:11.390 --> 17:13.127
- Not you.
- Mom, please. Let's go.

17:13.249 --> 17:15.161
I'm giving the man a compliment.

17:15.263 --> 17:17.023
No, sir. You do not
look like a writer.

17:17.195 --> 17:18.742
Did he sign your book?

17:18.867 --> 17:21.441
Oh, yes.
Mustn't forget this.

17:21.890 --> 17:29.675
"Emma, hopefully yours,
Joe."

17:35.342 --> 17:37.097
So which is our room?

17:44.734 --> 17:46.138
You mean, your room.

17:46.247 --> 17:48.070
Jacob and I are taking the master.

17:48.356 --> 17:49.575
You can't do that.

17:49.691 --> 17:51.275
Well, you're not gay anymore, remember?

17:51.385 --> 17:52.463
We were never gay.

17:52.565 --> 17:56.240
It's just with the kid, is that cool?

17:56.670 --> 17:58.164
Don't worry about it.

18:01.259 --> 18:02.840
I tracked her
through the prison footage.

18:02.960 --> 18:05.605
She used several aliases very
similar to the gay guys.

18:05.829 --> 18:06.965
3 years ago.

18:08.632 --> 18:09.866
The guy beside her.

18:09.990 --> 18:11.923
Jacob Wells.
You connected them.

18:12.035 --> 18:14.269
And get this.
I did a search for Jacob...

18:16.669 --> 18:18.256
Paul Torres.

18:18.455 --> 18:19.770
They signed in together.

18:19.882 --> 18:21.366
You were right.
They're all in on this.

18:21.472 --> 18:23.644
Hey. Find the first time
the nanny visited Carroll.

18:23.770 --> 18:25.502
Maybe she didn't use an alias.

18:28.246 --> 18:31.221
2004, she signed in as Emma Hill.

18:31.839 --> 18:34.606
Ok. There's an Emma Hill
in Petersburg, Virginia.

18:34.738 --> 18:35.671
I have an address.

18:35.785 --> 18:37.962
Petersburg is too close.
They'd never risk it.

18:38.071 --> 18:39.713
Unless they're hiding under our nose.

18:40.497 --> 18:42.653
Go. Take Weston.

18:43.309 --> 18:44.702
And Ryan.

18:46.169 --> 18:48.487
Call ahead. Have the local
authorities meet you there.

18:48.594 --> 18:49.811
Ok.

18:57.887 --> 18:59.145
Nobody's home.

18:59.278 --> 19:00.413
This is definitely the place.

19:00.507 --> 19:02.548
Neighbors say they haven't
seen anybody in a long time.

19:04.779 --> 19:06.605
Ok. You can't do that.

19:06.701 --> 19:08.818
Nope. You can't
do that.

19:09.140 --> 19:09.976
I'm gonna go check around back,

19:10.072 --> 19:11.779
see if I can see through the window.

21:11.683 --> 21:13.075
You shouldn't be here.

21:13.533 --> 21:15.177
You know, you're gonna die.

21:15.289 --> 21:16.468
Only not today.

21:16.681 --> 21:17.636
Unh!

21:24.727 --> 21:26.955
Good news--
no dead puppies.

21:27.650 --> 21:30.038
Bad news-- I think it's
time to use that word

21:30.157 --> 21:31.458
nobody wants to use.

21:31.579 --> 21:34.681
So we have a cult.

21:35.178 --> 21:36.837
You sure this man wasn't Jordy?

21:36.923 --> 21:39.398
Height, weight-- nothing matched.
It was someone else.

21:39.507 --> 21:41.154
We weren't supposed to find this place.

21:41.359 --> 21:43.157
This is where they met and planned.

21:43.257 --> 21:44.013
I think Carroll was--

21:44.111 --> 21:47.744
Carroll's using Poe's
work as a religion.

21:47.846 --> 21:50.338
He's speaking to people
through Gothic Romanticism.

21:50.444 --> 21:55.183
There's a pathology to today's
internet techno-bred minds.

21:55.607 --> 21:58.846
It's created a new...
vacancy in our humanity.

21:59.931 --> 22:04.512
Find the ones with additional
disorders-- jackpot.

22:04.789 --> 22:08.331
Enter a handsome, charismatic man

22:08.616 --> 22:10.269
who can touch them,

22:11.426 --> 22:14.466
let them feel their lives
for the first time,

22:14.780 --> 22:16.390
conditions them.

22:17.866 --> 22:22.549
The only way to truly live is to kill.

22:24.010 --> 22:26.304
Or some crap like that.

22:28.935 --> 22:31.548
I run the Bureau's
alternative religion unit.

22:31.680 --> 22:33.271
Did I not mention that?

22:33.537 --> 22:36.377
Cults-- my specialty.

22:42.359 --> 22:43.411
Hey.
We online?

22:43.525 --> 22:44.879
- Yeah.
- Is it secure?

22:44.985 --> 22:46.974
It's a little slow, but I got
us keyed into the board.

22:47.087 --> 22:48.489
It's untraceable.

22:48.599 --> 22:49.819
You check the news yet?

22:49.938 --> 22:51.536
Yeah. We're everywhere, man.

22:52.466 --> 22:54.815
That's the photo that they pick of me?

22:54.926 --> 22:56.088
I hate that picture.

22:56.197 --> 22:58.173
Did you get it running?
What's up with Jordy?

22:58.279 --> 22:59.269
Well, he hasn't
e-mailed yet,

22:59.369 --> 23:01.540
but they did find 3 girls
at the sorority house.

23:01.669 --> 23:03.488
Score for the village idiot.

23:04.495 --> 23:06.702
Hey, Paul. Will you go watch
Joey for a few minutes?

23:06.806 --> 23:08.061
I can do it.

23:09.947 --> 23:11.753
Be a good wingman, Paul.

23:20.770 --> 23:22.639
Are you sure he's straight?

23:22.794 --> 23:24.956
Because he is acting like
a jealous little bitch.

23:25.851 --> 23:28.158
He just feels like the third wheel.

23:28.843 --> 23:31.429
And for a long time,
it was just me and him.

23:31.544 --> 23:32.861
Now everything's changed.

23:32.960 --> 23:34.845
Well, he needs to adjust.

23:36.797 --> 23:38.923
This is what Joe wanted.

23:41.299 --> 23:42.968
What do you think?

23:44.137 --> 23:46.758
My mom says that it
makes me look like a boy

23:48.152 --> 23:49.978
or a girl who doesn't like boys.

23:50.096 --> 23:51.554
Well, your mother
doesn't understand you.

23:51.654 --> 23:53.025
She never has.

23:53.786 --> 23:57.009
No. I like it
very much, Emma.

23:57.138 --> 23:58.718
It's beautiful.

24:00.817 --> 24:04.114
What if I told you that I might know

24:04.246 --> 24:06.867
someone else who might like it, too?

24:09.018 --> 24:10.471
A guy?

24:11.085 --> 24:13.087
You want to set me up?

24:14.085 --> 24:16.415
I think you'd like each other.

24:16.842 --> 24:18.730
I don't know.

24:21.733 --> 24:23.915
I love our visits.

24:24.097 --> 24:25.972
They mean the world to me,

24:27.592 --> 24:31.425
but I think you need to
make more friends,

24:31.543 --> 24:35.884
you know, go out, have some fun, huh?

24:39.442 --> 24:41.190
Heh heh heh.

24:46.352 --> 24:47.975
Emma?

24:51.540 --> 24:53.101
Hi.

24:56.285 --> 24:58.301
Joe said you'd be my type.

25:00.036 --> 25:01.821
What's your type?

25:04.850 --> 25:06.679
Special.

25:21.732 --> 25:24.238
I've got 8, maybe 9
different handwritings.

25:24.360 --> 25:25.798
I want analysis on each one.

25:25.919 --> 25:26.574
How many prints?

25:26.673 --> 25:28.384
4. Clean.
Several partial.

25:28.498 --> 25:29.995
Our masked man was living here, too.

25:30.100 --> 25:31.320
Unmade bed, fresh food.

25:31.426 --> 25:32.434
There's internet upstairs.

25:32.548 --> 25:33.947
He took his laptop and server.

25:39.623 --> 25:42.556
_

25:44.890 --> 25:46.910
Is it ok if I'm happy about this?

25:47.031 --> 25:50.425
I mean, I know-- I know divorce is
not a happy subject,

25:50.545 --> 25:52.533
but I'm happy.

25:52.646 --> 25:54.099
Well, it's a new chapter in your life.

25:54.226 --> 25:57.457
I mean, you know, Joe's
been sentenced, he's gone.

25:57.728 --> 25:59.734
I think you deserve some happy.

26:00.447 --> 26:04.023
All right. Well, here's to
being a single lady again.

26:05.141 --> 26:06.483
Ooh.
That's depressing.

26:06.591 --> 26:07.705
Ha ha.

26:09.558 --> 26:10.887
Kiss me.

26:13.390 --> 26:14.622
Yeah, yeah.
You heard me.

26:14.740 --> 26:16.514
I'm single, so just...

26:18.363 --> 26:19.668
Are you sure you want me to kiss you?

26:19.776 --> 26:21.022
Uh, yeah.
I'm very sure.

26:21.132 --> 26:22.912
I've been sure for a long time.

26:23.444 --> 26:25.543
Well, if you're sure.

26:25.649 --> 26:26.882
Unless-- are-- but--

26:27.002 --> 26:28.392
are you sure?
Because if--

26:28.515 --> 26:29.649
I don't think first kisses are

26:29.809 --> 26:31.710
supposed to have this much discussion.

26:31.825 --> 26:33.219
I know. It takes the
spontaneity out of it.

26:33.345 --> 26:34.128
Yeah, it kind of does.

26:34.237 --> 26:35.706
Did I just ruin our first kiss?

26:36.357 --> 26:38.423
I think it can be salvaged.

27:02.965 --> 27:04.892
So we got an update from Rick.

27:05.907 --> 27:08.004
FBI found Emma's house.

27:09.065 --> 27:10.748
What do you mean
they found Emma's house?

27:10.863 --> 27:11.730
Was Jordy there?

27:11.824 --> 27:13.116
No. Rick was,
but he got away.

27:13.229 --> 27:14.868
Now he wants Emma to call.

27:15.164 --> 27:16.418
Why?

27:17.084 --> 27:19.303
Because she's in charge, remember?

27:19.448 --> 27:21.522
I'm not trusted with
the important things.

27:22.223 --> 27:24.374
That's not true, all right?

27:24.600 --> 27:28.015
She's just been here
for longer, that's all.

27:28.297 --> 27:31.187
You guys need to stop this
thing that you got going.

27:31.313 --> 27:32.195
It's awkward.

27:32.301 --> 27:34.181
Awkward for whom, man?

27:34.580 --> 27:37.022
Look. I'm fine.
It's just I don't get

27:37.132 --> 27:38.694
what you see in her.

27:39.309 --> 27:41.325
You're way out of her league, man.

27:44.744 --> 27:47.252
I think she's amazing.

27:58.470 --> 28:01.220
So tell me, Jacob,

28:01.772 --> 28:03.278
what do you do?

28:05.888 --> 28:08.659
Uh, currently I am in between jobs.

28:09.987 --> 28:12.728
Well, you're too pretty to work.

28:12.976 --> 28:14.142
Mom!

28:14.979 --> 28:16.828
I can't believe you two are dating.

28:20.063 --> 28:23.939
Your daughter is the most
amazing woman I know.

28:24.279 --> 28:26.543
Hmm. Hmm.

28:26.650 --> 28:28.429
So you like
the no-fuss plain Janes.

28:28.546 --> 28:29.586
That's sweet.

28:29.703 --> 28:30.983
Most boys don't.

28:31.109 --> 28:32.601
Unh!

28:33.328 --> 28:39.393
♪ I watched a change in you ♪

28:39.713 --> 28:46.159
♪ it's like you never had wings ♪

28:46.253 --> 28:47.838
You did it.

28:48.375 --> 28:52.652
♪ Now you feel so alive ♪

28:53.181 --> 28:57.818
♪ I've watched you change ♪

28:57.926 --> 28:59.706
You really did it.

29:00.352 --> 29:05.234

29:05.377 --> 29:10.392

29:12.088 --> 29:13.911
♪ I'm home ♪

29:31.335 --> 29:33.021
Who are all these women?

29:33.712 --> 29:37.250
They're all names of women in
Poe's life and work that died.

30:06.421 --> 30:09.470
A female.
She's been dead a while.

30:09.593 --> 30:10.882
The mother?

30:11.252 --> 30:12.691
Buried in the wall.

30:12.807 --> 30:15.250
"The Black Cat,"
"The Cask Of Amontillado,"

30:15.388 --> 30:16.840
classic Poe.

30:27.622 --> 30:28.815
Call the Matthews residence.

30:28.934 --> 30:30.714
Make sure Claire Matthews is safe.

30:40.290 --> 30:41.811
She's safe.
The house is secure.

30:41.942 --> 30:43.430
There's no sign of entry.

30:48.006 --> 30:48.889
Anything?

30:49.030 --> 30:51.003
Denise's real name is Emma Hill.

30:51.154 --> 30:52.795
She's been visiting Joe in prison.

30:52.911 --> 30:56.373
She is part of this,
but, no, we didn't find her.

31:16.217 --> 31:18.724
Hey, fellas.
Eyes up, huh?

31:18.839 --> 31:23.302
You're on watch.
Coffee break for God's sake.

31:43.936 --> 31:45.550
All good.

32:01.035 --> 32:03.114
9 different handwritings were found.

32:03.343 --> 32:05.073
We matched all our suspects,

32:05.188 --> 32:08.380
but, uh, 5 remain unidentified.

32:09.340 --> 32:13.675
ME has confirmed that the dead body is
Emma's mother Sharon Cooper.

32:13.796 --> 32:15.676
Still no ID on the masked man.

32:16.524 --> 32:19.609
Jordy, a disorganized
killer with a low IQ,

32:19.728 --> 32:21.834
how does he just disappear?

33:23.081 --> 33:24.170
What are those?

33:24.713 --> 33:25.968
Blueprints.

33:27.160 --> 33:29.583
They were on the wall
of the nanny's house.

33:31.222 --> 33:33.331
That's the closet
they took her through.

33:34.728 --> 33:37.328
That's the garage where
the officer was killed.

33:42.283 --> 33:46.035
Wait a minute.
That's Claire's basement!

33:51.951 --> 33:53.438
Go, go, go!

33:53.552 --> 33:54.964
Cover the back!

33:58.287 --> 34:00.492
Don't shoot!
I'm unarmed.

34:00.596 --> 34:02.347
It's you.

34:02.592 --> 34:05.576
Finally. You know,
we've been waiting for you.

34:05.692 --> 34:08.036
Keep them out!
Keep everybody out!

34:08.139 --> 34:09.559
Get back!
Everyone back.

34:09.655 --> 34:10.971
Get back!

34:11.438 --> 34:12.800
Ok, Jordy.

34:14.031 --> 34:15.534
They're gone.

34:15.793 --> 34:18.588
Just us. Ok?

34:19.918 --> 34:21.366
Can I shut the door?

34:21.475 --> 34:23.333
Yeah. That's good.
You shut the door.

34:35.306 --> 34:36.862
Take the gun away from her head.

34:36.960 --> 34:38.433
I have to kill her.

34:38.634 --> 34:39.833
No, you don't.

34:39.995 --> 34:41.522
And you have to watch.

34:41.681 --> 34:44.880
Those are the rules,
or, uh--

34:45.478 --> 34:46.938
Or what?

34:47.152 --> 34:49.304
Or you have to kill me.

34:51.039 --> 34:53.135
I'm not sure I'm ready to die.

34:53.254 --> 34:54.429
Jordy, nobody has to die.

34:54.543 --> 34:55.815
Joe doesn't want her to die.

34:55.922 --> 34:57.258
Yes, he does!

34:57.344 --> 34:59.736
And he chose me to do it,
not anyone else, me!

34:59.842 --> 35:02.892
This is my chapter, and I can
write it any way I want to!

35:03.004 --> 35:04.683
Ok. I'll tell you what.

35:05.223 --> 35:06.647
Why don't we call him?

35:07.732 --> 35:10.913
We can call him.
We can ask him.

35:11.267 --> 35:12.707
I have his number.

35:14.930 --> 35:18.773
There's a phone right
over there by the bed.

35:22.493 --> 35:24.070
Get an ambulance!

35:32.436 --> 35:34.499
The storm windows were padlocked.

35:34.611 --> 35:35.919
The man had a key.

35:36.043 --> 35:37.039
The nanny gave it to him.

35:37.153 --> 35:38.330
He was dressed as a cop.

35:38.451 --> 35:39.845
He hid under one of the AC units

35:39.979 --> 35:41.270
nobody knew about.

35:41.413 --> 35:43.688
Except the nanny, who gave it to him.

35:43.805 --> 35:45.128
Come on.
How are we supposed to know that?

35:45.251 --> 35:46.760
It's your job!

35:48.598 --> 35:51.444
Ok. Listen up.
If you're not a federal agent,

35:51.566 --> 35:53.936
I want you out of this
house now, you understand?

35:54.045 --> 35:55.366
Come on.
Let' go.

36:22.136 --> 36:23.818
What's up?

36:25.031 --> 36:26.923
She's a strong woman.

36:27.090 --> 36:28.493
She has to be.

36:28.764 --> 36:29.986
The prison guard's in surgery.

36:30.099 --> 36:31.128
He'll be fine.

36:31.243 --> 36:32.810
We'll question him the
second he's conscious.

36:32.935 --> 36:34.376
I want to see Joe.

36:35.694 --> 36:37.778
So you can break his other hand?

37:05.391 --> 37:07.313
Don't trust me alone with you.

37:08.885 --> 37:10.388
How's the hand?

37:11.958 --> 37:13.660
Have you slept?

37:14.367 --> 37:16.347
You look tired.

37:16.501 --> 37:18.967
It's important you
take care of yourself,

37:19.162 --> 37:21.033
preserve you strength.

37:21.221 --> 37:23.168
I've made a few requests,

37:23.276 --> 37:26.272
nothing scandalous,
just a couple of books.

37:26.371 --> 37:27.909
Claire almost died tonight.

37:28.028 --> 37:30.649
I like to read before bed.

37:31.071 --> 37:33.655
Calms the mind, helps me sleep.

37:33.762 --> 37:35.489
She almost died,

37:35.684 --> 37:37.452
the woman you profess to love.

37:37.577 --> 37:39.777
Yeah, but she didn't.

37:39.880 --> 37:41.845
I was hoping you'd save her.

37:42.119 --> 37:44.074
An heroic victory by the leading man

37:44.194 --> 37:45.883
that cements the love story.

37:45.988 --> 37:47.445
What if I hadn't arrived in time?

37:47.555 --> 37:50.991
Well, that's what makes the
story so unpredictable.

37:51.090 --> 37:52.488
You got to toughen up, Ryan.

37:52.588 --> 37:55.006
You're dealing with depraved minds,

37:55.282 --> 37:56.854
sick and twisted.

37:57.940 --> 38:01.529
Jordy was a mere puppy

38:02.529 --> 38:05.861
compared to some of the games
I have in store for you.

38:13.531 --> 38:15.273
Why you doing this, Joe?

38:15.393 --> 38:17.165
The challenge, Ryan.

38:17.523 --> 38:19.412
Accept it.

38:19.548 --> 38:21.771
We've barely even started.

38:21.970 --> 38:24.116
I have so many surprises

38:24.240 --> 38:26.242
waiting for you.

38:26.730 --> 38:30.175
And how long do you think you
can keep this up behind bars?

38:30.456 --> 38:32.148
What's the end game?

38:32.271 --> 38:34.429
That's a question the hero must answer.

38:34.563 --> 38:36.413
I'm sorry, Ryan.
You really are gonna have to do

38:36.531 --> 38:38.652
some of the work yourself.

38:40.540 --> 38:45.524
Jordy was the first step
in your return to form.

38:45.643 --> 38:48.680
You saved the day.
How does it feel

38:48.801 --> 38:53.035
to be victorious, to kill the villain?

38:58.745 --> 39:00.518
I didn't kill him.

39:01.889 --> 39:03.069
Yeah. Jordy's
alive and well.

39:03.179 --> 39:05.468
He's in a cell right down the hall.

39:07.239 --> 39:09.603
That wasn't part of the plan, was it?

39:11.284 --> 39:15.305
No. It doesn't matter.

39:15.525 --> 39:17.170
He knows nothing.

39:17.836 --> 39:20.936
Man's a halfwit.

39:21.047 --> 39:23.486
Extremely short shelf life, you know?

39:23.605 --> 39:26.253
Probably shouldn't tell him
that when I speak to him.

39:26.857 --> 39:28.230
Sleep tight.

39:41.120 --> 39:43.760
It's good?
Ok. Thanks.

39:50.193 --> 39:51.679
You don't have to stay here, you know?

39:51.789 --> 39:53.136
We could take you someplace else.

39:53.242 --> 39:54.614
Where?

39:57.395 --> 39:59.101
You should get some sleep.

40:01.103 --> 40:02.675
Don't go.

40:05.553 --> 40:08.002
I don't trust anyone but you.

40:10.508 --> 40:12.039
I'm not going anywhere.
