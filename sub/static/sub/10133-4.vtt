03:57.988 --> 04:01.075
my head down and the lights off.

04:01.116 --> 04:04.953

Walter Birman a Duckface.

It wasn't only me.

04:23.889 --> 04:26.516
It was the whole class.

04:26.558 --> 04:28.393
That's no excuse, young lady.

04:28.435 --> 04:31.688
Well, if you saw Walter,

04:28.435 --> 04:31.688
you'd call him a Duckface too.

04:31.730 --> 04:34.315
He's always

04:31.730 --> 04:34.315
making these duck lips.

04:36.610 --> 04:38.445
Kid sounds like a quack up.

04:40.030 --> 04:42.699
You should've seen it.

04:40.030 --> 04:42.699
The whole class was going..

04:42.741 --> 04:44.826
"Quack, quack, quack, quack

04:44.868 --> 04:48.288
quack, quack, quack, quack."

04:49.706 --> 04:52.292
Well, you had to be there.

04:54.377 --> 04:56.046
Stephanie, let me

04:54.377 --> 04:56.046
tell you a little story

04:56.088 --> 04:57.839
about your Uncle Jesse.

04:57.881 --> 05:00.008
When I was a kid,

04:57.881 --> 05:00.008
everybody used to tease me.

05:00.050 --> 05:01.802
They called me Zorba the Geek.

05:01.843 --> 05:03.178
[laughing]

05:05.097 --> 05:07.641
Zorba the Geek.

05:05.097 --> 05:07.641
Ha ha ha.

05:09.143 --> 05:11.561
Kids can be so cruel.

05:11.603 --> 05:13.605
Uncle Jesse, you were a geek?

05:13.647 --> 05:15.023
Now, let me tell you

05:13.647 --> 05:15.023
something, the day I turned

05:15.065 --> 05:17.358
13 my body flipped out.

05:17.400 --> 05:20.361
My nose outgrew my face,

05:17.400 --> 05:20.361
my ears outgrew my nose.

05:20.403 --> 05:23.782
I was your basic

05:20.403 --> 05:23.782
Mr. Potato Head.

05:23.824 --> 05:26.868
So before you

05:23.824 --> 05:26.868
were a stud, you were a spud.

05:29.496 --> 05:31.748
I'm not helping, am I?

05:31.790 --> 05:33.374
Listen to your Uncle Jess.

05:33.416 --> 05:34.835
Steph, the point

05:33.416 --> 05:34.835
I'm trying to make is

05:34.876 --> 05:36.878
that those kids

05:34.876 --> 05:36.878
really hurt my feelings.

05:36.920 --> 05:39.547
So I know how Walter feels, and

05:36.920 --> 05:39.547
I think it would be a good idea

05:39.589 --> 05:41.549
if you called and apologized.

05:41.591 --> 05:44.219
Me? Call Duckface?

05:44.261 --> 05:48.265
Yes, you call duckfa..

05:44.261 --> 05:48.265
Walter.

05:48.307 --> 05:49.641
Hi, everybody.

05:49.683 --> 05:51.685
Daddy, I'm so happy to see you!

05:51.726 --> 05:53.352
[chuckles]

05:51.726 --> 05:53.352
Aww.

05:53.394 --> 05:57.191
Dorothy was right.

05:53.394 --> 05:57.191
"There's no place like home."

05:57.232 --> 05:58.692
Just because I teased Duckface

05:58.733 --> 06:01.320
at school Uncle Jesse's

05:58.733 --> 06:01.320
making me call him.

06:03.655 --> 06:05.991
Honey, you know it's wrong

06:03.655 --> 06:05.991
to hurt someone's feelings.

06:06.033 --> 06:08.451
I think your Uncle Jesse's

06:06.033 --> 06:08.451
handling this just right.

06:09.744 --> 06:12.122
Okay, I'll call Walter

06:09.744 --> 06:12.122
and tell him I'm sorry.

06:12.164 --> 06:16.001
Then I'll invite him over for

06:12.164 --> 06:16.001
some soup and quack-ers. Ha!

06:16.043 --> 06:19.462
[laughs]

06:16.043 --> 06:19.462
I kill myself!

06:21.298 --> 06:22.674
Stephanie.

06:22.716 --> 06:25.468
I'm sorry, I had to

06:22.716 --> 06:25.468
get it out of my system.

06:27.386 --> 06:29.430
I'm gonna go track down

06:27.386 --> 06:29.430
Duckface..

06:51.870 --> 06:53.205

06:57.292 --> 06:59.961
who knows you as well

06:57.292 --> 06:59.961
as you know yourself.

07:00.003 --> 07:01.420
Like someone

07:00.003 --> 07:01.420
who lives in your house

07:01.462 --> 07:04.465
and helps you

07:01.462 --> 07:04.465

07:04.507 --> 07:06.551
You thinking what I'm thinking?

07:06.593 --> 07:08.595
There's only one logical choice.

07:08.636 --> 07:10.471
Yeah, but you think

07:08.636 --> 07:10.471
Jesse could do it?

07:11.932 --> 07:14.434
Easy, easy, Joey, I was

07:11.932 --> 07:14.434
just havin' fun with you.

07:14.475 --> 07:17.145

07:14.475 --> 07:17.145
I set it up, you got the job.

07:17.187 --> 07:18.813
- I did?

07:17.187 --> 07:18.813
- Yeah.

07:18.855 --> 07:21.191
Great! Yes!

07:21.233 --> 07:22.984
You know, you should've

07:21.233 --> 07:22.984
kept me going.

07:25.153 --> 07:27.447
You were this close

07:25.153 --> 07:27.447
to gettin' your car waxed.

07:30.700 --> 07:32.160

Wait, wait, wait.

07:39.960 --> 07:42.545
Slow down, Michelle.

07:44.047 --> 07:46.967
Observing you is

07:44.047 --> 07:46.967
supposed to be easy.

07:47.008 --> 07:49.428
So far..

You've played with

07:49.469 --> 07:50.971
all your animals

07:51.012 --> 07:54.308
and then you flushed

07:51.012 --> 07:54.308
every toilet in the house.

07:54.349 --> 07:56.059
Why don't we take a nap?

07:56.101 --> 07:57.769
Okay, nap time.

07:57.811 --> 07:59.146
Bless you.

08:03.191 --> 08:04.525
Nap over!

08:07.654 --> 08:10.115
I feel refreshed.

08:10.157 --> 08:11.908
Whoa.

08:11.950 --> 08:13.368
How's your report going, Deej?

08:13.410 --> 08:16.913
The question is,

08:13.410 --> 08:16.913
<i>where</i> is my report going?

08:16.955 --> 08:18.165
Alright, come on, Steph

08:18.206 --> 08:20.625
it's time to call Walter

08:18.206 --> 08:20.625
and apologize.

08:20.667 --> 08:24.545
I can't talk.

08:20.667 --> 08:24.545
I lost my voice!

08:24.587 --> 08:26.256
Oh, well then we're just

08:24.587 --> 08:26.256
gonna have to go over to

08:26.298 --> 08:29.134
Walter's house

08:26.298 --> 08:29.134
and apologize in person.

08:29.176 --> 08:31.552
My voice is back.

08:31.594 --> 08:32.971
It's a miracle.

08:33.013 --> 08:34.597
Hallelujah!

08:34.639 --> 08:37.267
Alright, Stepho,

08:34.639 --> 08:37.267
trust me on this one.

08:37.309 --> 08:39.978
You'll feel good,

08:37.309 --> 08:39.978
Walter will feel good and..

08:40.020 --> 08:43.106
...I'll feel good

08:40.020 --> 08:43.106
because I thought of the idea.

08:43.148 --> 08:45.566
Hold on one second.

08:43.148 --> 08:45.566
Here you go.

08:45.608 --> 08:48.820
Walter, this is

08:45.608 --> 08:48.820
Stephanie Tanner.

08:48.862 --> 08:52.782
And I'm really sorry.

08:48.862 --> 08:52.782
Well, nice talkin' to ya.

08:52.824 --> 08:55.702
Don't you think you should

08:52.824 --> 08:55.702
mention what you're sorry for?

08:55.743 --> 08:58.497
I'm sorry I quacked at you.

08:58.538 --> 09:00.040
And?

09:00.081 --> 09:01.416
And I called you Duckface

09:01.458 --> 09:03.960
and threw little pieces

09:01.458 --> 09:03.960
of bread at you.

09:07.381 --> 09:10.842
You threw pieces

09:07.381 --> 09:10.842
of bread at the kid?

09:10.884 --> 09:13.553
Steph, he's not a real duck.

09:14.554 --> 09:16.639
Tell him he's a very nice boy.

09:16.681 --> 09:19.059
Walter, you're a very nice boy.

09:19.100 --> 09:21.520
You're welcome.

09:19.100 --> 09:21.520
Anything else?

09:21.561 --> 09:23.146
Is there anything else

09:21.561 --> 09:23.146
that you'd like to say?

09:23.188 --> 09:24.772
- Yes, there is.

09:23.188 --> 09:24.772
- Good girl.

09:24.814 --> 09:25.982
Wanna say hi to my Uncle Jesse?

09:26.024 --> 09:27.775
- No, Steph, no, no.

09:26.024 --> 09:27.775
- Here he is.

09:27.817 --> 09:30.695
Hi, Walter.

09:27.817 --> 09:30.695
How are ya? Stephanie..

09:30.737 --> 09:33.365
Oh, you have a snake,

09:30.737 --> 09:33.365
that's great. Stephanie!

09:33.407 --> 09:37.118
Really? He ate a mouse?

09:33.407 --> 09:37.118
Mm, that's good eatin'.

09:37.160 --> 09:39.746
[instrumental music]

09:40.914 --> 09:43.958
Joey, let's go!

09:40.914 --> 09:43.958
We're gonna be late!

09:44.000 --> 09:46.586
Danny, what is the big rush?

09:46.627 --> 09:50.173
Joey, you know I always leave

09:46.627 --> 09:50.173
the house at<i> exactly</i> 7:48.

09:50.215 --> 09:52.759
Now thanks to you,

09:50.215 --> 09:52.759
I'm already two minutes late.

09:52.800 --> 09:56.054
What are you talking about?

09:52.800 --> 09:56.054
We are right on time.

09:58.848 --> 10:00.183
Joey.

10:01.017 --> 10:02.394
That's a barometer.

10:04.229 --> 10:05.688
Well, in that case,

10:04.229 --> 10:05.688
we'd better get moving

10:05.730 --> 10:07.315
there's a hurricane brewing.

10:07.357 --> 10:09.443
[doorbell rings]

10:07.357 --> 10:09.443
I'll get it.

10:20.245 --> 10:22.247
Hi, can I help you?

10:22.289 --> 10:24.749
Good morning.

10:22.289 --> 10:24.749

10:38.513 --> 10:40.390
Nice to meet you fine gentlemen.

10:40.432 --> 10:42.934
Well, come on in. You kids

10:40.432 --> 10:42.934

10:42.976 --> 10:44.352
See you later, Steph.

10:45.228 --> 10:47.730
- Walter?

10:45.228 --> 10:47.730
- Hi, Stephanie.

10:47.772 --> 10:49.190
What are you doing here?

10:49.232 --> 10:51.943
Walking through my living room?

10:51.985 --> 10:53.736
Sitting on my couch?

10:53.778 --> 10:55.155
I wanted to thank you in person

10:55.196 --> 10:57.824
for calling me

10:55.196 --> 10:57.824
yesterday to apologize.

10:57.865 --> 11:01.369
Well, it was just

10:57.865 --> 11:01.369
something I had to do.

11:01.411 --> 11:03.997
So you really think

11:01.411 --> 11:03.997
I'm a very nice boy?

11:05.582 --> 11:06.749
Uh..

11:06.791 --> 11:08.293
Yeah.

11:09.752 --> 11:11.546
This is marvelous!

11:11.588 --> 11:13.423
I never thought

11:11.588 --> 11:13.423
I'd have a friend

11:13.465 --> 11:15.842
and now I have a girlfriend!

11:15.883 --> 11:18.261
You do? Who?

11:18.303 --> 11:20.597
- You!

11:18.303 --> 11:20.597
- Me?

11:21.889 --> 11:24.518
Walter plus Stephanie

11:21.889 --> 11:24.518
equals true love.

11:24.559 --> 11:25.852
Forever.

11:29.022 --> 11:30.315
Forever?

11:33.318 --> 11:34.611
Walter.

11:34.653 --> 11:36.029
About this girlfriend thing.

11:36.070 --> 11:38.072
It's exciting, isn't it?

11:38.114 --> 11:40.033
I can't wait to

11:38.114 --> 11:40.033
tell the whole second grade

11:40.074 --> 11:42.202
that you're my girlfriend.

11:42.243 --> 11:45.704
Ah, man.

11:42.243 --> 11:45.704
I feel four feet tall.

11:46.705 --> 11:48.082
Whoa, whoa, wait.

11:48.124 --> 11:51.670
You can't tell<i> anyone</i>

11:48.124 --> 11:51.670
I'm your girlfriend.

11:51.710 --> 11:53.129
Oh, I get it.

11:53.171 --> 11:54.922
So you want it to be a secret?

11:54.964 --> 11:57.842
Uh. Yeah.<i> Top</i> secret.

11:57.884 --> 11:59.594
Ooh.

11:59.636 --> 12:01.720
A secret girlfriend.

12:03.139 --> 12:04.349
What does that mean?

12:05.724 --> 12:08.895
Well, it means we'll

12:05.724 --> 12:08.895
never talk to each other.

12:08.936 --> 12:10.938
We'll<i> never</i> look at each other.

12:10.980 --> 12:13.107
We'll<i> never</i> hold hands.

12:13.149 --> 12:15.527
We'll be total strangers.

12:15.569 --> 12:17.195
Okay. But you're still my--

12:17.237 --> 12:18.572
Shh!

12:18.613 --> 12:21.616
Secret girlfriend.

12:21.658 --> 12:25.495
Well, I guess

12:21.658 --> 12:25.495
I won't talk to you later.

12:25.537 --> 12:28.164
You know what I'm doing now?

12:30.291 --> 12:32.544
I'm afraid to ask.

12:32.586 --> 12:34.879
I'm giving you a secret kiss.

12:34.921 --> 12:36.423
In my mind.

12:43.513 --> 12:45.265
Eeww!

12:50.270 --> 12:51.563
Michelle, give me my paper back

12:51.605 --> 12:53.690
so I can write down

12:51.605 --> 12:53.690
that you stole it.

12:53.732 --> 12:55.066
My paper.

12:57.151 --> 13:01.698
Michelle, come..

12:57.151 --> 13:01.698
Ow! Ow. Ugh.

13:02.949 --> 13:04.200
Ow.

13:04.242 --> 13:05.910
I sorry.

13:07.287 --> 13:09.706
That's okay, Michelle.

13:09.748 --> 13:12.584
D.J. got a boo-boo?

13:12.626 --> 13:14.628
Yeah, I bumped my knee.

13:14.669 --> 13:17.255
I'll make it better.

13:20.174 --> 13:21.718
Thank you, Michelle.

13:21.760 --> 13:23.052
All better?

13:23.094 --> 13:24.345
All better.

13:24.387 --> 13:25.888
Okay, more fun.

13:32.646 --> 13:35.189
Have you seen<i> your</i> Uncle Jesse?

13:36.023 --> 13:37.816
Check his room.

13:37.858 --> 13:40.861
If I wasn't so steamed,

13:37.858 --> 13:40.861
<i>I</i> would have thought of that.

13:44.157 --> 13:46.159
May I come in? Thank you!

13:47.494 --> 13:48.745
You made me call Duckface

13:48.787 --> 13:50.913
and now he thinks

13:48.787 --> 13:50.913
I'm his girlfriend.

13:50.955 --> 13:54.375
He kissed me in his mind.

13:54.417 --> 13:57.629
If this gets out at

13:54.417 --> 13:57.629
school, I'm a dead duck.

13:57.671 --> 14:00.298
Have a nice a nice day.

14:05.136 --> 14:06.763
Ten seconds. Ten seconds.

14:06.805 --> 14:08.765
Where the heck is Joey?

14:06.805 --> 14:08.765
How can he be late?

14:08.807 --> 14:10.057
I drove him here.

14:10.099 --> 14:12.435
In four, three, two..

Wake Up, San Francisco.

I'm Danny Tanner

Rebecca Donaldson

14:17.649 --> 14:19.442
is on assignment today

14:19.484 --> 14:22.445
so filling in for her is

14:19.484 --> 14:22.445
a man who needs no introduction.

14:22.487 --> 14:24.739
Because...he's not here.

14:24.781 --> 14:27.283
Ahh. Sorry, Danny,

14:24.781 --> 14:27.283
this wasn't my fault.

14:27.325 --> 14:29.952
The uh, donut guy was late.

14:29.994 --> 14:33.122
Well, as you can see, we are

14:29.994 --> 14:33.122
gonna have a lot of fun today.

14:33.164 --> 14:34.749
Because my co-host this morning

14:34.791 --> 14:36.876
is one of the hottest young

14:34.791 --> 14:36.876

and he's also one of

14:36.917 --> 14:39.003
my closest personal friends

14:39.045 --> 14:40.505
and that's not

14:39.045 --> 14:40.505
just showbiz talk.

This is Joey Gladstone.

Oh, come on.

14:42.590 --> 14:44.925
Cut. It. Out.

14:46.386 --> 14:47.928
Danny, did you mention

14:46.386 --> 14:47.928
that I'd be headlining

14:47.970 --> 14:49.305
at the Laugh Machine

this weekend

14:49.347 --> 14:51.683
with a special

14:49.347 --> 14:51.683
late show on Saturday?

14:51.725 --> 14:54.935
Probably not, since we've only

14:51.725 --> 14:54.935
been on the air for 20 seconds.

14:54.977 --> 14:56.396

14:58.857 --> 15:01.401
I'll be headlining at

14:58.857 --> 15:01.401

15:05.988 --> 15:08.324
Well, Joey, it's time

15:05.988 --> 15:08.324
to bring out our first guest.

15:08.366 --> 15:10.577
He's the author of this book,

15:08.366 --> 15:10.577
"Hug your way to happiness"

15:10.618 --> 15:12.119
and he is my personal hero.

15:12.161 --> 15:15.623
Please welcome hug therapist,

15:12.161 --> 15:15.623
Dr. Reuben Weinager.

15:16.791 --> 15:18.418
Aaahhh.

15:25.299 --> 15:27.385
There's a lot

15:25.299 --> 15:27.385
of love on this set.

15:27.427 --> 15:28.469
Doctor.

15:28.511 --> 15:30.263
Thank you, thank you.

15:30.304 --> 15:32.891
You can tell so much

15:30.304 --> 15:32.891
by the way people hug.

15:32.932 --> 15:34.559
And I feel

15:32.932 --> 15:34.559
something's wrong here.

15:34.601 --> 15:38.354
Either one of you feeling

15:34.601 --> 15:38.354
hurt or suppressing any anger?

15:38.396 --> 15:40.981
Well, to be honest,

15:38.396 --> 15:40.981
there are some things

15:41.023 --> 15:43.276
I'd like him to take seriously.

15:43.317 --> 15:45.612
For instance, punctuality.

15:45.653 --> 15:48.865
Life's a little too short

15:45.653 --> 15:48.865
to be ruled by a clock.

15:48.907 --> 15:51.576
How would you know that?

15:48.907 --> 15:51.576
You tell time on a barometer.

15:52.952 --> 15:54.995
I'd rather be

15:52.952 --> 15:54.995
a free spirit than a guy

15:55.037 --> 15:57.248
who polishes his shoe trees.

15:57.290 --> 16:00.000
Hey, I don't

15:57.290 --> 16:00.000
polish them, I wax them.

16:00.042 --> 16:02.712
Well, they're wooden. You have

16:00.042 --> 16:02.712
to protect your shoe trees.

16:02.754 --> 16:05.673
From what? A woodpecker

16:02.754 --> 16:05.673
gettin' loose in your closet?

16:05.715 --> 16:07.425
Come on, Danny.

16:05.715 --> 16:07.425
I don't believe you.

16:07.467 --> 16:09.218
Joey, there's no reason to

16:07.467 --> 16:09.218
stand up. We're on television.

16:09.260 --> 16:10.470
Well, then

16:09.260 --> 16:10.470
the people at home

16:10.511 --> 16:11.721
should know

16:10.511 --> 16:11.721
how neurotic you are.

16:11.763 --> 16:13.431
I'm not neurotic.

16:13.473 --> 16:14.974
- Boys!

16:13.473 --> 16:14.974
- I'm not.

16:15.015 --> 16:17.435
Did you read my book?

16:15.015 --> 16:17.435
"Hug Your Way To Happiness?"

16:17.477 --> 16:18.770
Now hug!

16:18.812 --> 16:20.396
Come on, hug!

16:22.022 --> 16:23.817
Come on.

16:26.486 --> 16:28.655
Now say something nice

16:26.486 --> 16:28.655
to each other.

16:29.906 --> 16:32.199
I think it's great

16:29.906 --> 16:32.199
that you recycle.

16:34.034 --> 16:36.287
I think it's great that

16:34.034 --> 16:36.287
you'll be at the Laugh Machine

16:36.329 --> 16:37.789
all this weekend.

16:37.831 --> 16:40.166
With a special

16:37.831 --> 16:40.166
late show on Saturday.

16:51.719 --> 16:54.514
Are you having a nice time,

16:51.719 --> 16:54.514
young lady?

16:54.555 --> 16:58.476
This happens to be my sandwich

16:54.555 --> 16:58.476
and this is your sandwich.

16:58.518 --> 17:00.311
- Capisce?

16:58.518 --> 17:00.311
- Capisce.

17:02.355 --> 17:03.690
Hi, guys.

17:03.731 --> 17:05.191
- Hey.

17:03.731 --> 17:05.191
- Hey, Michelle, guess what?

17:05.232 --> 17:07.944
I read my report about you

17:05.232 --> 17:07.944
in class and I got an A.

17:07.986 --> 17:09.195
Mini five!

17:09.236 --> 17:11.155
(Jesse)

17:09.236 --> 17:11.155
'Haha, alright.'

17:11.197 --> 17:13.783
So it was a good idea,

17:11.197 --> 17:13.783
using the baby, huh?

17:13.825 --> 17:17.036
I'm not a baby, I'm a big girl.

17:17.077 --> 17:21.833
Ooh, a big girl.

17:17.077 --> 17:21.833
Excuse me, Miss Tanner.

17:21.875 --> 17:23.751
She's right, Uncle Jesse.

17:23.793 --> 17:26.420
You know Michelle I'm really

17:23.793 --> 17:26.420
glad I got to hang out with you.

17:26.462 --> 17:28.506
I mean we haven't spent

17:26.462 --> 17:28.506
much time together since

17:28.548 --> 17:29.757
I started junior high.

17:29.799 --> 17:31.342
So?

17:32.719 --> 17:35.179
So, you're like

17:32.719 --> 17:35.179
a little person now.

17:35.221 --> 17:37.765
You're sensitive,

17:35.221 --> 17:37.765
compassionate..

17:37.807 --> 17:40.267
...and you're actually

17:37.807 --> 17:40.267
smarter than most dogs.

17:46.566 --> 17:48.985
But you still gross me out.

17:51.153 --> 17:53.364
- Hey, Steph.

17:51.153 --> 17:53.364
- Hi, Uncle Jesse.

17:53.990 --> 17:55.324
Steph.

17:55.366 --> 17:56.617
How was school today?

17:56.659 --> 17:59.286
Oh. Just dandy.

17:59.328 --> 18:02.415
Walter<i> still</i> thinks that

17:59.328 --> 18:02.415
I'm his secret girlfriend.

18:02.456 --> 18:05.919
He was giving me kisses

18:02.456 --> 18:05.919
in his mind all day.

18:07.754 --> 18:09.296
Steph, I'm sorry but..

18:09.338 --> 18:11.758
...apologizing to Walter

18:09.338 --> 18:11.758
was the right thing to to.

18:11.799 --> 18:15.511
If it was the right thing,

18:11.799 --> 18:15.511
how come my life is a mess?

18:15.553 --> 18:17.179
Well, just because

18:15.553 --> 18:17.179
you do the right thing

18:17.221 --> 18:18.890
doesn't mean your

18:17.221 --> 18:18.890
life's gonna be perfect.

18:18.932 --> 18:21.059
You do the right thing because

18:18.932 --> 18:21.059
it's the right thing to do.

18:21.100 --> 18:22.518
You understand?

18:22.560 --> 18:24.395
So now if Walter thinks

18:22.560 --> 18:24.395
that you're girlfriend

18:24.437 --> 18:26.313
you just tell him that

18:24.437 --> 18:26.313
you guys are just friends

18:26.355 --> 18:28.608
but tell him nicely,

18:26.355 --> 18:28.608
no duck jokes.

18:28.649 --> 18:30.317
No more advice, please?

18:30.359 --> 18:32.111
I thought grown-ups were

18:30.359 --> 18:32.111
supposed to get you

18:32.152 --> 18:34.196
out of trouble,

18:32.152 --> 18:34.196
not get you into it.

18:34.238 --> 18:36.240
[doorbell rings]

18:36.282 --> 18:39.285
Those are my friends. They're

18:36.282 --> 18:39.285
here to work on our bug project.

18:39.326 --> 18:40.536
Excuse me.

18:42.455 --> 18:44.498
Steph. When you guys are

18:42.455 --> 18:44.498
done, you come up to my room.

18:44.540 --> 18:46.333
You and I are gonna

18:44.540 --> 18:46.333
have a little chat, okay?

18:46.375 --> 18:47.794
(Stephanie)

18:46.375 --> 18:47.794
'Okay.'

18:49.087 --> 18:52.298
- Walter.

18:49.087 --> 18:52.298
- Good afternoon, Stephanie.

18:52.339 --> 18:55.134
This is supposed to be a secret.

18:55.175 --> 18:56.343
No one knows I'm here.

18:56.385 --> 18:57.678
Except my mom.

18:57.720 --> 19:00.807
And I told her

18:57.720 --> 19:00.807
it was strictly business.

19:00.848 --> 19:02.391
Here.

19:02.433 --> 19:04.477
Thank you.

19:02.433 --> 19:04.477
They're very pretty.

19:04.518 --> 19:06.062
But I've got a

19:04.518 --> 19:06.062
lot of homework to do.

19:06.104 --> 19:09.398
So thank you, goodnight,

19:06.104 --> 19:09.398
and good luck.

19:09.440 --> 19:11.943
Oh! It's Duckface!

19:11.985 --> 19:14.194
You dumped me for Duckface?

19:14.236 --> 19:16.572
Mr. and Mrs. Duckface.

19:16.614 --> 19:20.118
They're going to get

19:16.614 --> 19:20.118
married and live in a pond!

19:20.159 --> 19:21.410
We're not married!

19:21.452 --> 19:24.288
Stephanie's just

19:21.452 --> 19:24.288
my secret girlfriend!

19:24.872 --> 19:27.583
Oh, Walter..

19:27.625 --> 19:30.503
So it's true.

19:27.625 --> 19:30.503
You are Mrs. Duckface.

19:30.544 --> 19:33.547
[kids quacking]

19:30.544 --> 19:33.547
Duckface! Duckface!

19:33.589 --> 19:36.300
Stop it! Stop teasing me!

19:36.342 --> 19:38.803
I'm not his secret girlfriend!

19:38.845 --> 19:41.430
I'm not his

19:38.845 --> 19:41.430

19:41.472 --> 19:43.432
Oh, yeah?

19:41.472 --> 19:43.432
Then prove it.

19:43.474 --> 19:46.185
Call him Duckface

19:43.474 --> 19:46.185
and throw him out!

19:47.728 --> 19:50.648
Quick, before I

19:47.728 --> 19:50.648

19:50.690 --> 19:52.733
No, I'm not gonna

19:50.690 --> 19:52.733
call him Duckface.

19:52.775 --> 19:56.112
- Oh, so he<i> is</i> your boyfriend.

19:52.775 --> 19:56.112
- 'Yeah.'

19:56.154 --> 19:58.823
He's not my boyfriend!

19:59.699 --> 20:01.575
But he is my friend.

20:01.617 --> 20:04.120
I am? I'm your secret friend?

20:04.162 --> 20:08.415
No, Walter. You're my

20:04.162 --> 20:08.415
everybody-can-know friend.

20:08.457 --> 20:11.418
And if you were my friends,

20:08.457 --> 20:11.418
you wouldn't tease him either.

20:11.460 --> 20:13.379
Why not? It's fun!

20:13.420 --> 20:14.755
Oh, yeah?

20:14.797 --> 20:16.674
Was it fun

20:14.797 --> 20:16.674
when you got hurt during recess

20:16.716 --> 20:19.135
and everyone

20:16.716 --> 20:19.135
called you Cryin' Bryan?

20:21.095 --> 20:22.680
I wouldn't laugh, Harry.

- Twice?

20:33.691 --> 20:35.985
- Hey!

20:36.027 --> 20:38.779
It doesn't feel so great

20:36.027 --> 20:38.779
to be teased, does it?

20:38.821 --> 20:40.114
(in unison)

20:38.821 --> 20:40.114
No.

20:40.156 --> 20:41.699
Walter, will you stay

20:41.741 --> 20:43.576
and be part of our group?

20:43.617 --> 20:45.411
I'd enjoy that!

20:45.452 --> 20:47.621
And thanks for

20:45.452 --> 20:47.621
sticking up for me.

20:47.663 --> 20:50.208
Sometimes you have to do

20:47.663 --> 20:50.208
the right thing.

20:50.249 --> 20:52.210
- Right group?

20:50.249 --> 20:52.210
- Yeah.

20:52.251 --> 20:53.586
Good answer.

20:55.046 --> 20:57.006
I'll be right back.

20:59.800 --> 21:01.301
Really? Yeah.

21:02.469 --> 21:03.721

Uh, hol..

Yeah, sure, pal.

Hey, how'd it go downstairs.

21:12.438 --> 21:14.023
Great.

How'd it go

Ya caught me, didn't you?

21:19.570 --> 21:21.989
Yeah. Uncle Jesse.

21:22.031 --> 21:23.950
I have something to tell you.

21:25.076 --> 21:26.244
You were right.

21:26.285 --> 21:28.871
Feels terrible being teased.

21:30.790 --> 21:32.625
Are we still friends?

21:32.666 --> 21:35.586
Oh, Stephanie, of course

21:32.666 --> 21:35.586
we're still friends.

21:35.628 --> 21:37.130
Why wouldn't we

21:35.628 --> 21:37.130
still be friends?

21:37.171 --> 21:39.423
Because I got so mad at you.

21:39.465 --> 21:41.759
I was never gonna

21:39.465 --> 21:41.759
trust you again.

21:41.801 --> 21:45.304
Stephanie Tanner, you can

21:41.801 --> 21:45.304
always trust your Uncle Jesse.

21:45.345 --> 21:47.140
Now, I may not do

21:45.345 --> 21:47.140
everything you like

21:47.181 --> 21:48.849
and I may even make

21:47.181 --> 21:48.849
mistakes once in a while

21:48.891 --> 21:52.436
but, I'm always gonna

21:48.891 --> 21:52.436
be on your side.

21:52.478 --> 21:54.354
I just...I just

21:52.478 --> 21:54.354
want you to grow up

21:54.396 --> 21:56.690
and be the best

21:54.396 --> 21:56.690

21:56.732 --> 21:58.943
Let me tell you

21:56.732 --> 21:58.943
something, right then?

21:58.985 --> 22:01.988
You're about as

21:58.985 --> 22:01.988
good as it gets, kid.

22:02.029 --> 22:05.074
When I grow up, I want to be

gonna be just like you.
