00:11.782 --> 00:14.645
Aw! 5th Avenue.

00:14.645 --> 00:18.519
With one of those horribly
expensive hotels. Oh, my!

Fourteen hundred dollars!

Yes, you are.

00:28.659 --> 00:31.162
- You make me!
- You think I won't?!

00:31.162 --> 00:34.065
- Are we gonna kiss now?
- I hope so!

00:34.065 --> 00:35.336
OK.

00:40.741 --> 00:43.314
I just saw Hannah Montana
out your window.

- No, you didn't.
- Yeah. Yes, I did.

- Nope! Mm-mm.
- Yes, I did. Yes, I did.

What's the rush?
No bathroom at the CD signing?

00:54.155 --> 00:57.158

- So? Whoa!

00:57.158 --> 00:59.830
- Siena saw me!
- Oh!

01:02.163 --> 01:05.166
Siena, why would
Hannah Montana be here?

01:05.166 --> 01:08.839
Oh, don't play so innocent.
I web-searched you,

01:08.839 --> 01:11.642
and I know all about that
whole "Jacksannah" thing.

01:11.642 --> 01:14.205
You web-searched me?

01:14.205 --> 01:16.177
You web-searched me.

01:16.177 --> 01:18.649
Oh, don't flatter yourself.

01:18.649 --> 01:20.581
When you've dated
as many losers as I have,

01:20.581 --> 01:24.185
you learn to do the work
to avoid the jerk.

01:24.185 --> 01:26.187
Are you seeing her again?

01:26.187 --> 01:28.189
I was never seeing her
in the first place.

01:28.189 --> 01:29.620
People just thought
we were dating.

01:29.620 --> 01:31.262
Why?

01:34.225 --> 01:36.467
Hey, Hannah! Gotcha!

01:36.467 --> 01:39.200
I knew if I kept following you,
I'd find out where you live.

01:39.200 --> 01:41.272
Live? Here? Me?

01:41.272 --> 01:43.604
No! I'm just here
to visit a friend.

01:43.604 --> 01:45.536
Looks more like
a boyfriend to me.

01:45.536 --> 01:48.679
- What?
- Say "front page!"

01:52.413 --> 01:56.547
Big misunderstanding.
She was just a friend.

01:56.547 --> 02:00.751
An obnoxious, all-consuming,
vortex of selfishness

02:00.751 --> 02:02.893
who I don't even talk to anymore
because she had a habit

02:02.893 --> 02:05.256
of messing up my life!

02:06.397 --> 02:08.158
No, I think the face
you probably saw

02:08.158 --> 02:10.261
was that of
my sister, Miley.

02:11.532 --> 02:14.365
In fact, I'm sure of it.
It was my sister, Miley.

- Miley!

02:19.510 --> 02:21.141

for 2,000, Alex!

Ow!

02:28.719 --> 02:29.780
Ah!

02:31.252 --> 02:35.686
Hmm... You were rude
and then you fell. Karma.

02:38.689 --> 02:42.263
Why couldn't flip-flops
go with this outfit?

02:42.263 --> 02:44.665
Jackson, I've had boyfriends
cheat on me before,

02:44.665 --> 02:46.166
and I'm not going there again.

02:46.166 --> 02:48.799
- OK, I won't do it. If you...
- Hey, Siena.

02:48.799 --> 02:53.304
Hi! I was just, uh,
coming here to tell you
I love your top.

02:53.304 --> 02:56.577
[Siena laughs] Um...
When did you see my top?

02:56.577 --> 03:00.681
- When she saw it
through the window.
- Exactly. Remember?

03:00.681 --> 03:03.754
Remember me at the...?
That was me.

03:03.754 --> 03:06.417
Shocked... that you're
still dating my brother.

03:07.688 --> 03:09.820

I saw a blonde.

03:09.820 --> 03:11.462
Honey, you're dating Jackson.

What a window-peekin',
kiss-killin' kidder you are.

Uh, thanks for clearing up
that little misunderstanding.

03:21.502 --> 03:23.704
- Bye-bye.
- Jackson, can I talk
to you for a second?

03:23.704 --> 03:27.638
- For you? No.
- Ha! Who's the kidder now?

03:28.739 --> 03:31.742
He'll be back soon.
Gives you time to run.

- That was way too close!

bringing her here.
- Oh, OK, sure, definitely.

Yeah, I'll stop bringing by
the only thing in my life

03:43.354 --> 03:45.896

shred of happiness!

03:45.896 --> 03:49.229

Mm-mm!

Got a big test coming up.

- Since when do you study?
- Since I found out Siena

Can you tell Dad I'll meet him
at the wardrobe fitting?

09:43.954 --> 09:47.958
Uh, what are you doing here?
Siena could walk in any minute!

09:47.958 --> 09:51.822
She's at a photo shoot
in San Diego... [groans]

09:51.822 --> 09:55.826
- What died in there?
- Your brother's dignity.

09:55.826 --> 09:58.268
Sometimes you gotta
let the dogs run.

09:58.268 --> 10:00.831
How can you two be so relaxed?

10:00.831 --> 10:03.273
I mean, what if
Siena finished early?

10:03.273 --> 10:04.835
What if she's on her
way back right now?

10:04.835 --> 10:07.908
- She could walk in any minute!
- Oh!

10:07.908 --> 10:10.110
You need to burn that thing.

10:10.110 --> 10:13.784
Let her walk through the door.
That just means a certain secret

10:13.784 --> 10:16.917
has to be told because
a certain deal was made.

10:16.917 --> 10:19.249
You know what else was made?

10:19.249 --> 10:21.852
A certain phone call to a
certain pop star's web master,

10:21.852 --> 10:23.794
which enabled my phone
to track Siena's phone,

10:23.794 --> 10:26.997
which is right now
on the beach in San Diego!

10:26.997 --> 10:28.859
[Siena] Knock knock knock!

10:33.864 --> 10:36.166
Hey, I'm sorry.
I would've called,

in San Diego.

Who is that?

is that Hannah Montana?

10:55.756 --> 10:57.888
Miley, why are you
under a bed sheet?

10:57.888 --> 11:00.791
Yes, Miley,
why are you under a bed sheet?

11:00.791 --> 11:03.894
Are you hiding something?
Perhaps a secret?

11:03.894 --> 11:07.067
- Me? A secret?
- Uh, no!

11:07.067 --> 11:11.842
She's just, uh, embarrassed
by how tacky she looks!

11:13.373 --> 11:15.976
- [Miley] OK.
- Yeah!

You always dress so incredibly,

the half of it.

11:37.127 --> 11:40.971
But if you did know
the half of it, you'd know
how clever what I just said was.

11:40.971 --> 11:43.333
- OK, I'll be right back.
- Bye.

11:44.875 --> 11:47.938
[Miley] Well, that was close,
but I think we pulled it off...

11:50.981 --> 11:52.412
All right, what was that?

11:52.412 --> 11:54.344
Brilliant
on-the-spot thinking?

11:54.344 --> 11:56.216
You promised you'd tell her.

11:56.216 --> 11:58.288
That's when I thought
my plan would work.

11:58.288 --> 12:01.021
- They usually work.
- They never work.

12:01.021 --> 12:03.423
Yeah, but then I learn
a valuable lesson
and everything's OK.

12:03.423 --> 12:06.897
- So, what's the
valuable lesson here?
- I don't know yet.

12:06.897 --> 12:10.761
Miley, she's almost
busted you twice. I'm not
gambling on a third time.

12:10.761 --> 12:14.004
We had a deal, and if you won't
tell her about Hannah, I will.

12:14.004 --> 12:16.967
OK, wait, wait, wait.
You're totally right.

12:16.967 --> 12:19.770
I said I'd tell her,
so I will.

12:19.770 --> 12:22.042
- Great, let's go.
- Wait. I can't right now.

12:22.042 --> 12:24.514
I have a wardrobe fitting.
But I'll be right back.

12:24.514 --> 12:28.118
- It's only gonna
take a few hours.
- No, that's not gonna work.

12:28.118 --> 12:31.121
- I have an exam in two hours.
- Well, I can't do it tonight.

12:31.121 --> 12:34.054
- I've got a
recording session...
- Then a concert

12:34.054 --> 12:36.787
and then a movie
and then a world tour.

12:36.787 --> 12:38.758
I know exactly
what you're doing.

12:38.758 --> 12:41.461
You're trying to push it off
until she and I break up.

12:41.461 --> 12:45.465
I never thought of that,
but it would make everything
easier on everyone.

12:45.465 --> 12:48.899
You know what?
You are telling her
after the fitting,

12:48.899 --> 12:50.270
whether I'm here or not.

12:54.875 --> 12:59.149
Whoa. So, uh, how are you
getting out of this?
What's the plan?

12:59.149 --> 13:02.282
There is no plan.

13:02.282 --> 13:04.084
I gotta tell her
I'm Hannah Montana.

13:04.084 --> 13:06.086
♪ Ooh, ah ♪

13:08.889 --> 13:11.561
♪ Ooh, ah
Ooh, ah, oh ♪

13:13.023 --> 13:14.364
Siena's coming.

13:14.364 --> 13:15.966
I don't know
if I'm ready for this.

13:15.966 --> 13:17.567
What are you nervous about?

13:17.567 --> 13:20.470
Hey, if Hannah's out,
Lola's out! Come on.

13:20.470 --> 13:23.834
Yeah. How is she
ever gonna handle the shock?

13:23.834 --> 13:25.805
I know!

13:25.805 --> 13:28.378
- Knock, knock, knock.
- Be strong.

13:28.378 --> 13:32.482
- I'll try.
- So, what's the big mystery?

13:33.443 --> 13:34.584
I'm really Lola!

13:35.445 --> 13:37.988
There, I said it!

13:37.988 --> 13:40.250
Don't you look at me!

13:40.250 --> 13:41.491
[sobbing]

13:43.353 --> 13:47.457
- What's up with her?
- That's my fault.
I let her in the room.

13:47.457 --> 13:49.599
Listen, Siena, I have something
I need to tell you,

13:49.599 --> 13:52.202
and it's not
really easy to say.

13:52.202 --> 13:55.835
I'm spending too much time
with Jackson and you're
missing your big brother.

13:55.835 --> 13:59.009
Yeah, I'm gonna have to answer
that with a big fat no.

14:00.340 --> 14:01.471
I think you'll understand

14:01.471 --> 14:03.473
- once you see my closet.
- Oh!

14:03.473 --> 14:05.545
You want my advice on
how to dress better.

14:05.545 --> 14:08.418
[stammers] Bikini
model say what?

14:08.418 --> 14:10.480
Don't be so
hard on yourself.

14:10.480 --> 14:13.553
You look great,
most of the time.

14:13.553 --> 14:16.957
- Most of the time?
- I mean, except for
a couple of sweaters

14:16.957 --> 14:18.889
and those interesting
ripped leggings,

14:18.889 --> 14:22.632
and I'm just assuming
this outfit is because
it's laundry day.

14:23.863 --> 14:25.635
I hope. [laughs]

14:25.635 --> 14:27.397
- All right, Siena...
- Don't be embarrassed.

14:27.397 --> 14:29.539
I said the same thing to Jackson
the other night on the beach

14:29.539 --> 14:33.443
when I borrowed his sweater
and saw that he bought it from
Dicky Roy's Clothes For Boys.

14:33.443 --> 14:35.575
He still shops there?

14:35.575 --> 14:39.579
I thought he moved on to
Lenny Green for Mini-Teens.

14:39.579 --> 14:42.552
Oh no! I promised
I wouldn't say anything!

14:42.552 --> 14:44.554
Please don't
tell him I told you.

14:44.554 --> 14:46.987
Oh, no!

14:46.987 --> 14:51.061
Like I would tell my brother
that you blurted out a secret?

14:51.061 --> 14:53.123
No! Well, really good.

14:53.123 --> 14:55.565
I really enjoyed this little
bonding moment we've had here.

14:55.565 --> 14:58.268
- I thought you were gonna
show me your clothes.
- I was,

14:58.268 --> 15:00.670
but I don't wanna ruin this
beautiful moment with...

15:00.670 --> 15:03.303
All the ugly clothes?

15:03.303 --> 15:05.905
- Yeah.
- You know what?

15:05.905 --> 15:07.677
I'm gonna take you
shopping on Saturday.

15:07.677 --> 15:09.579
I know we can
make you look better.

15:09.579 --> 15:12.142
Whoo! Yay!
I'm so excited,

15:12.142 --> 15:14.684
you... secret-spilling
blabbermouth.

15:18.688 --> 15:21.291
[cell phone vibrating]

15:32.502 --> 15:35.705
- What?!
- She told me about Dicky Roy's
Clothes For Boys.

15:35.705 --> 15:39.239
If she can't keep a secret
as stupid as that, she's not
gonna be able to keep mine.

15:39.239 --> 15:41.641
OK, so she messed up once.
Big deal.

15:41.641 --> 15:44.114
And Dicky offers
high-quality at a low price,

15:44.114 --> 15:47.247
with reinforced knees that
are rough-house guaranteed.

15:47.247 --> 15:51.721
- Jackson, she can't be trusted,
- The only one who
can't be trusted is you.

15:51.721 --> 15:54.724
- I'm telling Dad!
- Well, I'm gonna
get to him first,

15:54.724 --> 15:57.657
- 'cause I'm the only one
who knows he's at the pier.
- Thank you.

15:57.657 --> 16:00.460
You're welcome. Dang it!

16:04.334 --> 16:08.598
A, B, A, C, A.

16:08.598 --> 16:11.371
Huh. Studying
does make it easier.

16:11.371 --> 16:12.972
Good to know.

16:19.209 --> 16:22.282
Rico, I do love it that you're
giving this another try.

16:22.282 --> 16:25.385
Well, I do need
another hobby.

16:25.385 --> 16:28.758
Yeah, you can't rely
on messing with Jackson
the rest of your life.

16:30.260 --> 16:33.093
Although, it does
have its occasional charms.

16:33.093 --> 16:36.226
[both laugh]

16:36.226 --> 16:38.768
Look at you.
You're calmer already.

16:40.500 --> 16:42.632
Now, don't expect to
catch one right off the bat...

16:42.632 --> 16:44.574
- Whoa!
- Holy mackerel!

16:45.775 --> 16:49.379
- My goodness!
- Wow, that was easy!

16:49.379 --> 16:53.413
Now, son, don't let a little
beginner's luck go to your head.

16:53.413 --> 16:54.784
That's not gonna
happen every time.

17:09.059 --> 17:10.800
Dangflammit!

17:12.061 --> 17:14.733
I gotta tell ya,
I can't remember the last time

17:14.733 --> 17:18.068
I felt so at peace
with the world.

17:18.068 --> 17:21.411
- How are you doing?
- Fantastic.

17:21.411 --> 17:24.414
Bite, you little
pucker-faced suckers!

17:24.414 --> 17:28.147
I know you're down there!
Stop mocking me!

17:28.147 --> 17:29.449
- [Miley] Stop it!
- [Jackson] You stop it!

17:29.449 --> 17:31.821
[Miley] Ow! You stop it!

17:31.821 --> 17:34.824
- You fight like a girl!
- I am a girl!
What's your excuse!

17:34.824 --> 17:36.756
- Dad! We had a deal!
- Dad! He's being a jerk!

17:36.756 --> 17:38.828
Shh! Not now.

17:38.828 --> 17:41.731
Why don't I leave you to
your little family affair?

17:41.731 --> 17:44.694
It's not like the fish
are going anywhere. [laughs]

17:47.697 --> 17:51.771
There's something very
evil about that boy.
Make it quick.

17:51.771 --> 17:55.745
Miley was almost caught as
Hannah which made Siena crazy
jealous. I made her promise...

17:55.745 --> 17:58.708
...I found out she can't
keep a secret so now I won't!

18:00.310 --> 18:02.182
I understand.

18:02.182 --> 18:04.714
I know how important
this is to both of you,

18:04.714 --> 18:07.717
but it seems to me that...
Whoa!

18:07.717 --> 18:10.260
- I think I finally snagged one!
- Dad, it's important!

18:10.260 --> 18:12.762
- Yeah, so is this!
- Dad, focus, all right?

18:12.762 --> 18:15.465
- Tell her she has to tell!
- No, I do not!

18:15.465 --> 18:18.368
Son, I'm sorry,
but it's her secret,
it's gotta be her decision.

18:18.368 --> 18:20.870
- Yes!
- Now, give me back my pole!

18:20.870 --> 18:23.633
I'd love to,
but it's stuck.

18:23.633 --> 18:27.677
Son, you see that fish floppin'
out there? That's my pride, son.

18:27.677 --> 18:31.141
Fine. That's real fair.
You get your fish,

18:31.141 --> 18:34.344
Miley gets her way
and what do I get?

18:34.344 --> 18:37.817
Nothing but this stinking
pole hooked on my jacket!

18:37.817 --> 18:41.491
My life just goes
from bad to... worse!

18:41.491 --> 18:43.253
- [splashing]
- [both] Jackson!

18:43.253 --> 18:47.827
- Are you OK?
- [Jackson] Just dandy!

18:47.827 --> 18:50.760
- Still haven't caught anything?
- I have.

18:50.760 --> 18:54.504
You see that beauty out there
pulling my boy to sea?

18:54.504 --> 18:55.835
Mine.

18:55.835 --> 18:59.509
♪ Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah ♪

18:59.509 --> 19:01.771
♪ La-di-da-da-da ♪

19:03.913 --> 19:05.915
Jackson, it's not
as bad as you think.

19:05.915 --> 19:10.280
- I'll be careful.
- Oh, like you
were careful before?

19:10.280 --> 19:14.284
I feel so much better!

19:14.284 --> 19:16.926
That's the spirit! Glad
we had this little talk.

19:16.926 --> 19:19.259
Why can't you do this for me?

19:20.790 --> 19:23.393
Lilly knows,
Oliver knows, Jake knows,

19:23.393 --> 19:26.796
and he's an actor,
for crying out loud.
They're children!

19:26.796 --> 19:28.938
Well, those people
are important to me.

19:28.938 --> 19:31.541
- And Siena is important to me.
- But I don't trust her.

19:31.541 --> 19:33.172
- But I do!
- Jackson, please!

19:33.172 --> 19:35.205
Just forget it.

19:36.346 --> 19:38.878
- [door opens]
- Knock, knock, knock.

19:40.179 --> 19:43.453
Oh. Hey, Miley.
Is Jackson back from his test?

19:43.453 --> 19:45.815
- I've been calling him and...
- Oh, no.

19:45.815 --> 19:50.189
I would've answered,
but I didn't wanna pay the
underwater roaming charges.

19:50.189 --> 19:51.891
[phone rings and dies]

19:51.891 --> 19:55.865
- What happened?
- What happened?

19:55.865 --> 19:57.567
What happened?

19:59.729 --> 20:02.302
- What happened?
- Uh...

20:02.302 --> 20:04.704
I was at the pier,
I fell in the water

20:04.704 --> 20:06.706
and Jackson jumped in
and saved me.

20:06.706 --> 20:09.979
Oh, honey, you just
get better and better.

20:09.979 --> 20:13.843
Oh! Why aren't you wet?

20:14.844 --> 20:16.846
I dry faster.

20:18.848 --> 20:20.990
Aw, see?

20:20.990 --> 20:23.653
You told the Hannah secret
and everything's OK.

20:26.726 --> 20:28.358
Oh, boy.

20:29.499 --> 20:33.363
- The Hannah secret?
- Uh...

20:33.363 --> 20:36.806
I knew it.
You are still seeing Hannah.

20:36.806 --> 20:38.468
I'm out of here.

20:38.468 --> 20:40.009
Me, too.

20:40.009 --> 20:41.411
- Siena!
- What?

20:41.411 --> 20:43.012
I...

20:47.417 --> 20:51.421
- Nothing.
- Yeah. I thought so.

20:52.522 --> 20:53.883
He's not dating Hannah!

20:53.883 --> 20:55.885
Then what's the big secret?

20:56.926 --> 20:59.629
- You really trust her?
- I do.

21:01.260 --> 21:02.792
- Then I do, too.
- Hello!

21:02.792 --> 21:05.895
I'm trying to make a dramatic
exit and you're ruining it!

21:05.895 --> 21:08.898
Come on. You'll understand
when you see my closet.

21:08.898 --> 21:11.270
I already know
you have ugly clothes!

21:11.270 --> 21:13.443
The things I do for you.

21:16.676 --> 21:18.648
- [sighs]
- Unbelievable.

21:18.648 --> 21:21.280
- So you're Hannah Montana?
- Yep.

21:21.280 --> 21:24.514
And you've been pulling
this off for five years?

21:24.514 --> 21:26.516
I've been Lola for four.

21:27.917 --> 21:29.719
Who's Lola?

21:30.860 --> 21:34.063

get the whole fish.

- Yeah, I got it.
- From tip to tail?

21:53.012 --> 21:55.685
From tip to tail.

21:55.685 --> 21:59.449
By the way, the one
that Jackson left off my
line was that one's daddy.

21:59.449 --> 22:03.453
Oh, you mean the one
that Jackson "let go."

22:03.453 --> 22:06.696
- He did!
- Of course he did.

22:06.696 --> 22:09.999
That's it. Here's your
stupid camera. I'm going home.

22:09.999 --> 22:11.701
Shake it off, big guy!

I have a feeling tomorrow's
gonna be your day.

22:19.469 --> 22:20.740
Great job, Ernie.

22:20.740 --> 22:23.973
But tomorrow,
put a fish on his line. One.

22:23.973 --> 22:26.516
Small one.
Gotta keep him coming back.

22:26.516 --> 22:31.050
[sighs] Nothing more relaxing
than messing with a Stewart.

22:31.050 --> 22:34.123
Am I right, big guy?
Yeah, I'm right.
