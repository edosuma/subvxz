WEBVTT

00:02.002 --> 00:03.237
Family is the ultimate power
on The Gifted.

00:03.271 --> 00:05.573
A lot of people
have been fighting this fight
for a long time,

00:05.606 --> 00:07.141
and now it's our turn.

00:07.175 --> 00:08.976
Catch all-new episodes Mondays.

00:09.009 --> 00:10.711
And check out our other
Fox programs-- The Orville,

00:10.744 --> 00:12.546
Lucifer, and Gotham.

00:12.580 --> 00:14.715
Gotham needs more people
who are willing
to fight for her.

00:14.748 --> 00:15.749
Only on Fox.

00:17.285 --> 00:19.687
I am a mutant.
And so were you.

00:22.022 --> 00:23.057
REED:
Dad?

00:23.091 --> 00:25.559
We need to talk to you
about your work. At Trask.

00:25.593 --> 00:27.695
They're experimenting
on mutants.

00:27.728 --> 00:29.497
My own best friend was turned.

00:29.530 --> 00:30.564
He's working
for Sentinel Services.

00:30.598 --> 00:33.667
OTTO: A research project
to eliminate the X-Gene

00:33.701 --> 00:35.436
in you-- that was what
brought me to Trask.

00:35.469 --> 00:37.105
REED:
When I was sick?

00:37.138 --> 00:38.506
Dad, I nearly died.

00:38.539 --> 00:39.573
ESME:
I'm a telepath

00:39.607 --> 00:40.941
and I've been getting
some very weird

00:40.974 --> 00:42.042
thoughts from one of the others.

00:42.076 --> 00:43.744
Hey.

00:43.777 --> 00:46.046
CAITLIN: You don't have to talk.
Just think.

00:46.080 --> 00:47.615
Who did this to you?
Where are they?

00:47.648 --> 00:48.749
I can see it.

00:50.151 --> 00:51.885
It's a building.

00:51.919 --> 00:53.020
Some kind of lab.

00:53.053 --> 00:54.422
North of here.

00:54.455 --> 00:57.024
OTTO: My father
and his sister Andrea

00:57.057 --> 00:59.693
were known as Fenris.
The Wolf.

00:59.727 --> 01:02.130
They had the same abilities
as your children.

01:02.163 --> 01:04.632
Have they held hands?

01:04.665 --> 01:06.134
Shoot him!

01:09.903 --> 01:11.472
SS AGENT:
Don't worry, Dr. Campbell,

01:11.505 --> 01:13.141
we're going to get you
to a hospital.

01:13.174 --> 01:15.743
Gus. I'm gonna make them pay
for what they did to you.

01:17.478 --> 01:19.447
-LAUREN: What happened with
your dad? -REED: He died today.

01:19.480 --> 01:20.781
Oh, babe.

01:25.619 --> 01:28.256
(birds singing,
children chattering)

01:32.092 --> 01:33.427
Andy!

01:37.265 --> 01:39.733
CAITLIN: Nice.
I didn't know you could do that.

01:39.767 --> 01:41.502
I have all kinds of
secret talents.

01:41.535 --> 01:43.404
(Caitlin laughs)

01:43.437 --> 01:46.073
REED:
Hey... This is good, right?

01:46.106 --> 01:48.108
Well, don't get cocky, but yeah.

01:48.142 --> 01:49.810
It's really good.

01:52.446 --> 01:53.914
It's been too long
since we've done this.

01:53.947 --> 01:56.016
-I'm sorry work's been so crazy.
-Don't.

01:56.049 --> 01:57.185
We understand.

01:57.218 --> 01:59.187
What you do, it's important.

01:59.220 --> 02:00.321
It's just, I've missed you.

02:00.354 --> 02:02.923
The kids, too.

02:02.956 --> 02:04.458
Well, I'm here now.

02:06.627 --> 02:08.128
-(laughs softly)
-They doing all right?

02:08.996 --> 02:10.531
CAITLIN:
Yeah.

02:10.564 --> 02:13.033
I mean, Lauren's been
a little distant lately,

02:13.066 --> 02:16.304
but I think it's just
normal teenager stuff.

02:16.337 --> 02:20.641
It's nice to see them
not bickering for once.

02:20.674 --> 02:21.809
Wanna try that?

02:23.311 --> 02:24.278
No, I'm not gonna do that.

02:24.312 --> 02:25.779
What do you mean?

02:25.813 --> 02:26.714
I don't skateboard.

02:26.747 --> 02:28.015
Yeah, you can. Here.

02:28.048 --> 02:29.149
Back foot on the tail,

02:29.183 --> 02:30.451
front foot halfway up the deck.

02:30.484 --> 02:31.819
It's fine, it's easy.

02:31.852 --> 02:34.288
Pop and flick...
like a karate kick, okay?

02:34.322 --> 02:35.823
-Halfway up...
-I'm gonna fall, no.

02:35.856 --> 02:37.191
No, you... Trust me.

02:37.225 --> 02:38.792
I'm... I'll be here.
I can catch you.

02:38.826 --> 02:40.228
-Promise?
-Yeah.

02:41.362 --> 02:43.130
Help me up.

02:43.163 --> 02:44.898
Okay.

02:44.932 --> 02:46.967
-Ready?
-Yeah.

02:47.000 --> 02:48.636
LAUREN:
Okay.

02:48.669 --> 02:50.604
(Lauren gasps)

03:16.597 --> 03:18.366
Hey!

03:18.399 --> 03:20.534
You guys all right over there?

03:20.568 --> 03:23.170
Yeah.

03:23.203 --> 03:25.306
Messing around.

03:30.043 --> 03:32.212
*

03:37.385 --> 03:39.553
(birds singing faintly)

03:45.559 --> 03:47.461
*

03:50.964 --> 03:53.901
ELLEN: Reed, don't.
Your father's working.

04:03.110 --> 04:06.213
ELLEN: But you're leaving me
to do this all on my own.

04:06.246 --> 04:08.215
He needs you.

04:08.248 --> 04:09.717
He's your son.

04:09.750 --> 04:11.919
What do you mean,
you can't come to see him?

04:13.787 --> 04:15.756
(exhales)

04:26.367 --> 04:28.302
Hey, you.

04:30.103 --> 04:32.506
(Caitlin exhales)

04:32.540 --> 04:34.742
I woke up and you were gone.

04:34.775 --> 04:36.076
I'm sorry.

04:36.109 --> 04:38.078
Couldn't sleep.

04:38.111 --> 04:40.581
Thinking about your dad?

04:40.614 --> 04:44.284
I hadn't spoken
to the man in 20 years. I...

04:46.854 --> 04:49.923
...didn't think losing him
would make me...

04:49.957 --> 04:51.892
(sighs)

04:53.961 --> 04:55.663
I get it.

04:57.197 --> 04:59.933
My mom and I couldn't be in
the same room without her

04:59.967 --> 05:03.337
bringing up every screwup
of my teenage years

05:03.371 --> 05:05.939
to remind me how perfect
Jenny and Danny were.

05:05.973 --> 05:07.541
(Reed sighs)

05:07.575 --> 05:09.777
When she got sick,
we finally started

05:09.810 --> 05:13.180
to get past all that crap,
but...

05:13.213 --> 05:15.649
it was too late.

05:18.151 --> 05:19.620
I almost think it's worse

05:19.653 --> 05:23.391
when you're not close,
because...

05:23.424 --> 05:25.993
you realize
how much time you missed.

05:28.996 --> 05:31.331
Yeah.

05:37.371 --> 05:39.540
Reed, I...

05:39.573 --> 05:42.009
I hate to bring this up, but...

05:42.042 --> 05:43.611
I have to ask.

05:47.014 --> 05:49.049
If Otto was a mutant...

05:49.082 --> 05:53.186
and your grandfather
and his twin were, too...

05:53.220 --> 05:56.223
I-It's just, I...

05:56.256 --> 05:58.892
I thought
mutations were random.

05:59.960 --> 06:01.895
Mostly, they are.

06:04.632 --> 06:08.536
But they can be
passed down, too.

06:10.738 --> 06:12.706
Then why did it skip you?

06:15.409 --> 06:17.077
(exhales)

06:18.479 --> 06:19.947
Did it skip you?

06:22.483 --> 06:25.786
My dad's work
at Trask Industries...

06:28.388 --> 06:31.625
He spent his life
trying to find a way

06:31.659 --> 06:34.194
to suppress the X-Gene...

06:34.227 --> 06:36.129
in me.

06:36.163 --> 06:38.532
(exhales)

06:38.566 --> 06:40.000
And he succeeded.

06:41.735 --> 06:44.304
But it came back. In our kids.

06:44.337 --> 06:46.106
I... Did you know?

06:46.139 --> 06:47.975
-Of course not. What?
-I-I...

06:48.008 --> 06:49.877
Did you think I'd keep
something like that from you?

06:49.910 --> 06:52.112
I'm sorry, I-I'm just trying
to wrap my head around

06:52.145 --> 06:54.214
how this never came up
after all these years.

06:54.247 --> 06:55.883
Your mom, she...

06:55.916 --> 06:59.553
For two years,
we thought I had leukemia, Cait.

06:59.587 --> 07:01.789
He kept it as a secret
from everybody.

07:03.691 --> 07:05.826
And it destroyed my family.

07:13.934 --> 07:16.704
Well, we're not going
to let it destroy ours.

07:21.041 --> 07:22.976
(birds singing)

07:24.344 --> 07:25.846
(indistinct chatter)

07:25.879 --> 07:27.748
ESME: We need to go after
the Trask lab now.

07:27.781 --> 07:28.982
We have to rescue
those people...

07:29.016 --> 07:30.450
Have to?
You're pretty new here to be

07:30.484 --> 07:31.451
telling people
what they have to do.

07:31.485 --> 07:32.452
You don't get it!

07:32.486 --> 07:34.021
My family is in there.

07:34.054 --> 07:35.623
-They're running out of time.
-Okay, well, slow down.

07:35.656 --> 07:36.857
THUNDERBIRD:
You got all that information

07:36.890 --> 07:38.826
from the woman
they sent after us?

07:38.859 --> 07:39.993
Yes.

07:40.027 --> 07:43.163
I mean,
her mind was hard to read.

07:43.196 --> 07:45.499
Confused. But I got enough.

07:45.533 --> 07:48.168
The mutants in that lab,
they were desperate.

07:48.201 --> 07:52.472
I-I could hear the screams.
I could see the bodies.

07:52.506 --> 07:54.007
I could feel the agony

07:54.041 --> 07:56.810
when they turned that woman
into that thing.

07:56.844 --> 07:59.146
And it's all happening
in that building.

07:59.179 --> 08:00.548
We know where this place is?

08:00.581 --> 08:01.949
I'm assembling a site map now.

08:01.982 --> 08:03.617
So why are we standing here?

08:03.651 --> 08:05.485
Did you get anything
on their security?

08:05.519 --> 08:07.621
No. It...
Her mind was too cloudy,

08:07.655 --> 08:08.822
but what does it matter?

08:08.856 --> 08:11.659
We are the last hope
those prisoners have.

08:15.763 --> 08:18.331
You saw what they did
to your friend.

08:18.365 --> 08:19.900
We sit on our hands,

08:19.933 --> 08:21.702
and that happens to more people.

08:21.735 --> 08:24.237
No one is sitting
on their hands.

08:24.271 --> 08:26.173
Now, we will make
a move on that lab,

08:26.206 --> 08:27.541
but if we go in blind...

08:28.909 --> 08:30.510
...we die.

08:38.919 --> 08:42.055
Johnny?
Are you all right?

08:42.089 --> 08:43.256
(Thunderbird sighs)

08:43.290 --> 08:44.925
How can I be "all right"?

08:47.360 --> 08:48.662
Maybe Esme has a point.

08:48.696 --> 08:50.564
But she's just a scared kid,

08:50.598 --> 08:52.332
who has no idea
what she's talking about.

08:52.365 --> 08:54.401
She was right about one thing.

08:54.434 --> 08:56.336
Pulse.

08:56.369 --> 08:57.671
I left him behind

08:57.705 --> 08:59.406
and they took him to that lab.

08:59.439 --> 09:01.575
That's not on you, Johnny.

09:01.609 --> 09:05.012
And continuing to blame yourself
is not doing anybody any good.

09:05.045 --> 09:06.847
Besides, d...

09:06.880 --> 09:09.583
don't you think it's strange

09:09.617 --> 09:11.218
that she knew about Pulse?

09:11.251 --> 09:13.020
-I mean, she just got here.
-She's a telepath, Sonya.

09:13.053 --> 09:14.688
Maybe she
picked it up off of me.

09:14.722 --> 09:17.224
It doesn't change the fact

09:17.257 --> 09:18.926
that I gave up on my friend

09:18.959 --> 09:21.228
and they turned him
into a monster.

09:24.397 --> 09:28.669
I'll be damned if I'm gonna
let that happen to anybody else.

09:42.082 --> 09:44.251
Hey.

09:44.284 --> 09:47.087
Lauren.

09:47.120 --> 09:49.222
You awake?

09:49.256 --> 09:50.724
(sighs) Yeah.

09:50.758 --> 09:53.927
I can't stop thinking
about what Dad said.

09:54.995 --> 09:57.898
About Grandpa Otto being...

09:57.931 --> 09:59.566
like us.

09:59.599 --> 10:02.302
Not just him.

10:04.371 --> 10:06.573
Here, check this out.

10:06.606 --> 10:07.908
I found this in the library.

10:07.941 --> 10:10.077
You know where
the library is here?

10:10.110 --> 10:12.512
Who are you and
what have you done with Andy?

10:12.545 --> 10:13.847
Ha ha ha.

10:13.881 --> 10:15.849
Look, this section's
on the 1950s.

10:15.883 --> 10:18.652
Andrea and Andreas von Strucker.

10:20.220 --> 10:22.322
They called themselves
"Fenris"?

10:22.355 --> 10:25.425
Yeah, I think it means "wolf"
in some language.

10:25.458 --> 10:27.360
LAUREN:
Oh, my God.

10:27.394 --> 10:29.697
-They did that?
-Yeah.

10:29.730 --> 10:31.031
They combined powers
by holding hands.

10:31.064 --> 10:32.432
They wiped out
an entire building

10:32.465 --> 10:33.600
full of people in seconds.

10:33.633 --> 10:35.836
This is crazy.

10:35.869 --> 10:39.172
This is our family history.

10:39.206 --> 10:41.174
Look, it says here
they're "rumored to be

10:41.208 --> 10:43.543
"part of a shadowy
international organization

10:43.576 --> 10:45.545
called the Hellfire Club."

10:45.578 --> 10:47.147
Does it say
what happened to them?

10:49.249 --> 10:52.152
I think they disappeared
fleeing from the X-Men.

10:52.185 --> 10:55.288
They were some of
the most powerful mutants ever.

10:55.322 --> 10:56.957
Yeah.

10:56.990 --> 10:59.126
It also says they were monsters.

10:59.159 --> 11:00.327
-Well, I'm just saying...
-I don't care.

11:01.762 --> 11:03.997
Go to bed.

11:18.746 --> 11:22.215
(baby crying in distance)

11:25.552 --> 11:27.420
Hello?

11:27.454 --> 11:28.789
(crying stops)

11:30.958 --> 11:33.093
(distorted baby crying)

11:33.126 --> 11:35.028
-(crying fades)
-(groans)

11:57.550 --> 11:58.752
Marcos.

11:58.786 --> 12:00.854
Marcos!
Marcos, what's happening?

12:00.888 --> 12:02.823
(echoing):
Marcos!

12:05.392 --> 12:06.794
(grunting)

12:06.827 --> 12:09.062
(baby crying in distance)

12:10.798 --> 12:12.432
Oh, no.

12:13.767 --> 12:16.036
-(crying continues)
-No, no, no...

12:16.069 --> 12:19.406
No, no, no, no!
(sobs)

12:19.439 --> 12:20.707
(screams)

12:20.740 --> 12:21.441
(grunts)

12:22.843 --> 12:24.444
(grunting)

12:24.477 --> 12:26.146
(screams)

12:26.780 --> 12:28.949
(screaming)

12:28.982 --> 12:30.984
Hey, hey, hey,
it was just a dream.

12:31.018 --> 12:33.220
The baby... the baby's at Trask.

12:33.253 --> 12:35.322
No. Hey, the baby's here.

12:35.355 --> 12:37.124
-Hey, the baby's fine.
-(panting)

12:37.157 --> 12:40.227
POLARIS: Marcos, in my dream,
Trask had the baby.

12:40.260 --> 12:42.329
We have to get into that lab.

12:42.362 --> 12:45.098
-We have... we have to help
those people. -Yeah.

12:45.132 --> 12:47.067
ECLIPSE:
We will. Hey.

12:47.100 --> 12:49.602
We will. I promise.

12:49.636 --> 12:52.339
I promise.

12:52.372 --> 12:54.107
(Eclipse panting)

13:01.014 --> 13:02.682
-(distant siren wailing)
-(over P.A.): Dr. Barnes...

13:02.715 --> 13:05.285
(pained groaning)

13:11.791 --> 13:13.426
How's he doing?

13:13.460 --> 13:16.263
Docs said Campbell was burned
pretty bad, but he'll live.

13:16.296 --> 13:18.031
Said he didn't want surgery.

13:18.065 --> 13:20.800
I guess his mutant has skills.

13:20.834 --> 13:22.035
(pained groaning)

13:22.069 --> 13:23.636
The Mutant Underground's
gonna be looking

13:23.670 --> 13:26.273
to launch another attack--
we got to put a team together.

13:26.306 --> 13:29.109
Come on, be tough to sell
an operation like that

13:29.142 --> 13:30.643
without specific intel.

13:30.677 --> 13:33.513
Washington was pissed
about losing those two agents.

13:33.546 --> 13:34.948
Washington's pissed?

13:34.982 --> 13:37.017
I'm the one that had
to tell the families.

13:38.886 --> 13:40.720
Look, we got
all the intel we need.

13:40.753 --> 13:43.123
The Underground knows
about the Hound program now.

13:43.156 --> 13:44.657
They're gonna have to hit
Campbell's lab.

13:44.691 --> 13:46.493
The place is top secret--
how will they even find it?

13:46.526 --> 13:48.061
What are you talking about?
They're mutants.

13:48.095 --> 13:49.496
They can shoot lasers
out of their hands.

13:49.529 --> 13:51.831
I'm pretty sure
they can find a building.

13:57.004 --> 13:59.139
I know I'm right about this.

13:59.172 --> 14:00.974
We can bury the paperwork.

14:01.008 --> 14:04.211
Just... get some techs
on it, all right?

14:05.412 --> 14:07.847
Yeah. I'll see what I can do.

14:11.084 --> 14:13.086
(pained groaning)

14:18.558 --> 14:20.227
I've been looking
into the Trask lab.

14:20.260 --> 14:22.662
This place is
out in the middle of nowhere.

14:22.695 --> 14:23.897
There is no information on it.

14:23.931 --> 14:25.232
But there is this.

14:25.265 --> 14:26.599
THUNDERBIRD:
A bar?

14:26.633 --> 14:27.500
What good does that do us?

14:27.534 --> 14:29.169
I cross-referenced
credit card activity

14:29.202 --> 14:31.038
with places near the lab,
and this place

14:31.071 --> 14:32.505
is popular with Trask employees.

14:32.539 --> 14:33.506
I could go in.

14:33.540 --> 14:34.774
Pull some information
out of a guard

14:34.807 --> 14:36.009
or an operations person.

14:36.043 --> 14:37.077
That's a good idea.

14:37.110 --> 14:38.511
I'll go for protection.

14:38.545 --> 14:41.381
-No. I will.
-Are you sure, babe?

14:41.414 --> 14:43.750
I mean, you haven't
really been sleeping well.

14:43.783 --> 14:46.186
I'm okay.

14:46.219 --> 14:49.556
Marcos, if you want to get
information from a guy at a bar,

14:49.589 --> 14:52.125
you don't send a girl
and another guy.

14:52.159 --> 14:53.893
We'll be fine.

15:00.733 --> 15:03.403
Hey. Hope you're hungry.

15:03.436 --> 15:06.206
I have a nondairy
cheese and chive omelet

15:06.239 --> 15:07.607
with your name on it.

15:08.908 --> 15:10.577
(Reed chuckles)

15:17.450 --> 15:20.387
How are you handling
all of this?

15:20.420 --> 15:22.155
(exhales)

15:22.189 --> 15:25.825
I know it's not fair, but I...

15:25.858 --> 15:28.561
I keep thinking how different
everything would have been

15:28.595 --> 15:31.331
i-if Lauren would have
just told us she was a mutant.

15:31.364 --> 15:33.666
-Come on, we can't go down
that road. -Or if your father

15:33.700 --> 15:36.836
would have just told
everyone the truth.

15:36.869 --> 15:38.938
Our whole lives
would be different.

15:38.972 --> 15:40.307
Your job.

15:40.340 --> 15:42.242
H-How we raised our kids.

15:42.275 --> 15:45.178
-I mean, Andy may have never...
-We did the best that we could.

15:45.212 --> 15:46.813
(shuddering exhale)

15:46.846 --> 15:48.115
Hmm.

15:51.118 --> 15:53.120
What about you? If...

15:53.153 --> 15:56.356
if you'd known then
what you know now...

15:56.389 --> 16:00.260
would you have done
anything differently?

16:00.293 --> 16:02.195
With us?

16:04.531 --> 16:06.199
No.

16:08.035 --> 16:09.669
Cait...

16:09.702 --> 16:11.171
(sighs)

16:11.204 --> 16:14.007
...there is one more thing
I haven't told you.

16:14.041 --> 16:16.376
My dad told me

16:16.409 --> 16:20.447
that his father and aunt...

16:20.480 --> 16:22.782
were terrorists.

16:22.815 --> 16:24.951
-What?
-They had

16:24.984 --> 16:27.120
the same powers
as Andy and Lauren.

16:27.154 --> 16:29.822
And when they
combined them together,

16:29.856 --> 16:31.958
they were massively destructive.

16:31.991 --> 16:34.194
I... And you...

16:34.227 --> 16:37.197
you think Andy and Lauren
can do the same thing?

16:37.230 --> 16:38.798
-I don't know.
-Well,

16:38.831 --> 16:40.833
-we have to tell them.
-Do we?

16:40.867 --> 16:42.569
Isn't that like

16:42.602 --> 16:45.405
-handing them a loaded gun?
-Your father, he didn't tell you

16:45.438 --> 16:48.375
you were a mutant-- you think
he did the right thing?

16:52.512 --> 16:54.181
(sighs)

16:54.214 --> 16:57.284
No more secrets, Reed.

17:03.390 --> 17:06.359
POLARIS:
So, you're really in charge?

17:06.393 --> 17:08.361
Of the entire security system?

17:08.395 --> 17:10.997
I mean, not like the boss boss,

17:11.030 --> 17:13.733
but of my shift? Yeah.

17:13.766 --> 17:16.002
Basically, I... I run it.

17:16.035 --> 17:17.604
-Hmm.
-Wow, that sounds intense.

17:17.637 --> 17:19.206
DREAMER:
Mm-hmm.

17:19.239 --> 17:20.907
You don't know the half of it.

17:20.940 --> 17:22.409
The place is like a fortress.

17:22.442 --> 17:25.512
You know, automatic guns,
detectors...

17:25.545 --> 17:27.580
*

17:27.614 --> 17:30.750
I shouldn't be telling you
any of this.

17:32.752 --> 17:35.722
Must be so scary
to work with mutants.

17:35.755 --> 17:38.091
Do you ever worry
they'll attack you?

17:38.125 --> 17:42.595
Oh, they have a whole program
in place to make them behave.

17:42.629 --> 17:44.797
Remember when they
were calling themselves

17:44.831 --> 17:47.200
"Homo superior"?

17:47.234 --> 17:50.303
Well, they're not so superior
when you...

17:50.337 --> 17:52.305
crack 'em in the head
with a nightstick.

17:52.339 --> 17:54.741
I mean, one good shot
to the temple...

17:56.743 --> 17:57.644
...they drop...

17:59.812 --> 18:00.780
A little like that?

18:00.813 --> 18:01.881
Lorna, what the hell?

18:01.914 --> 18:03.583
What? I'm just teaching him

18:03.616 --> 18:06.119
-to respect the genetically
different. -(groans)

18:06.153 --> 18:08.421
Quit crying. Nobody saw.
Just do your thing.

18:19.166 --> 18:21.168
Give him anything
to remember us by?

18:21.201 --> 18:23.403
Mm. Just a lonely night...

18:23.436 --> 18:26.072
till he cracked his head
on a urinal.

18:26.105 --> 18:30.109
Best girls' night ever.

18:32.845 --> 18:35.482
*

18:35.515 --> 18:37.184
So, you guys are
for real right now?

18:37.217 --> 18:39.085
Like, seriously serious?

18:39.118 --> 18:41.854
Yes, that's-that's why
we thought we should...

18:41.888 --> 18:43.656
deal with this as a family.

18:43.690 --> 18:45.425
I think we learned
the hard way that

18:45.458 --> 18:48.428
discovering mutant abilities
by accident isn't ideal.

18:48.461 --> 18:49.962
REED:
Look, it might be nothing.

18:49.996 --> 18:51.598
My dad could possibly be wrong.

18:51.631 --> 18:53.466
Just because the von Strucker
twins could do it

18:53.500 --> 18:55.668
-doesn't necessarily mean...
-What if he's right?

18:55.702 --> 18:57.970
You want us
to destroy something?

18:58.004 --> 18:59.972
-Definitely not. No.
-No. No.

19:00.006 --> 19:02.475
Th-That's... that's
why we wanted to test it

19:02.509 --> 19:04.311
in the vault-- just to...

19:04.344 --> 19:07.347
(sighs) ...to see
if there's anything there.

19:10.750 --> 19:12.319
Okay.

19:18.090 --> 19:19.659
(Andy exhales)

19:25.164 --> 19:26.966
(Lauren exhales)

19:26.999 --> 19:29.402
*

19:37.677 --> 19:40.179
So...

19:40.213 --> 19:42.148
this is weird.

19:42.181 --> 19:44.317
(sighs)
But is...

19:44.351 --> 19:46.319
is there... anything?

19:46.353 --> 19:49.055
Yeah. Andy's hand is sweaty.

19:49.088 --> 19:51.023
CAITLIN:
O-Okay. Well, then maybe

19:51.057 --> 19:52.992
there's... there's nothing
to worry about.

19:53.025 --> 19:54.394
Maybe it's nothing.

19:54.427 --> 19:57.530
No. Wait.
Just give it a chance, okay?

19:57.564 --> 19:59.499
Maybe we gotta, like,
squeeze harder or something,

19:59.532 --> 20:02.935
actually want something
to happen. Come on. Please?

20:02.969 --> 20:04.471
We got to try.

20:25.992 --> 20:28.828
*

20:54.621 --> 20:57.256
*

21:03.195 --> 21:04.431
Hey.

21:04.464 --> 21:07.266
Hey, hey.
Hey, hey, hey, hey. Hey!

21:09.936 --> 21:11.771
CAITLIN:
What happened?

21:14.441 --> 21:16.108
LAUREN:
I don't know.

21:16.142 --> 21:17.744
It was like...

21:17.777 --> 21:19.579
-I could feel...
-Everything around me.

21:19.612 --> 21:21.448
All we had to do is push.

21:21.481 --> 21:23.983
I-I don't understand.
Did you use the power?

21:24.016 --> 21:25.785
Dad...

21:25.818 --> 21:28.421
if we tried...

21:28.455 --> 21:31.090
Did you feel that?
Everything coming apart?

21:31.123 --> 21:33.192
-Kids, what happened?
-LAUREN: We were about

21:33.225 --> 21:36.663
to bring down
the entire building.

21:36.696 --> 21:39.766
We would have killed
everyone here.

21:39.799 --> 21:41.701
*

21:50.142 --> 21:52.345
Sonya and I have been going
through the memories she got

21:52.379 --> 21:53.980
from that guard
and it does not look good.

21:54.013 --> 21:55.047
What are we up against?

21:55.081 --> 21:56.282
Well, the lab is hardened

21:56.315 --> 21:57.884
against mutant attack.

21:57.917 --> 22:00.953
They have motion
and infrared sensors connected

22:00.987 --> 22:03.289
to heavy-caliber guns that are
mounted all over their building.

22:03.322 --> 22:05.124
-Guns? I can handle guns.
-ECLIPSE: I know, but it is

22:05.157 --> 22:07.494
way too dangerous when there's
this many, at this range.

22:07.527 --> 22:10.129
Clarice, can you get us
past their defenses?

22:10.162 --> 22:11.398
No. It's too far.

22:11.431 --> 22:12.399
I don't know the first thing

22:12.432 --> 22:13.466
about the inside of that place.

22:13.500 --> 22:14.501
I could blink us into

22:14.534 --> 22:15.502
the middle of a concrete wall.

22:15.535 --> 22:16.636
Well, there has to be something.

22:16.669 --> 22:18.571
I did find one vulnerability.

22:18.605 --> 22:20.873
There is a power substation
a few miles away.

22:20.907 --> 22:22.742
If we took it out,
we could get into the lab

22:22.775 --> 22:24.844
before their systems
came back on line.

22:24.877 --> 22:27.079
-So what are we waiting for? -We
don't have enough heavy hitters

22:27.113 --> 22:29.816
to attack both places at once.
And we're checking with

22:29.849 --> 22:31.418
-the other stations now. -Well,
how long is that gonna take,

22:31.451 --> 22:34.086
-because my family... -Listen,
I understand... -Esme. Esme.

22:34.120 --> 22:37.524
Believe me. This means
as much to me as it does to you.

22:37.557 --> 22:40.059
But we are gonna get
one shot at this.

22:40.092 --> 22:41.728
We can't miss.

22:48.200 --> 22:50.903
So, what happened in the vault?

22:50.937 --> 22:52.905
CAITLIN:
What did you feel, exactly?

22:52.939 --> 22:54.674
ANDY:
Everything around us

22:54.707 --> 22:57.877
kind of... just disappeared.

22:57.910 --> 23:01.347
And it's like, there wasn't
two of us anymore.

23:01.380 --> 23:03.215
There was just one.

23:03.249 --> 23:07.454
It's like... we were seeing
out of the same eyes.

23:09.722 --> 23:12.892
You said you could have
destroyed a building.

23:12.925 --> 23:15.394
-How did you know that?
-I could feel it.

23:16.629 --> 23:17.864
Andy pushes things apart, right?

23:17.897 --> 23:19.932
I do the opposite,
I can pull them together.

23:19.966 --> 23:23.536
Combined, it was like, we could
do whatever we wanted. I mean,

23:23.570 --> 23:24.871
we were looking at the wall
in front of us,

23:24.904 --> 23:28.808
and-and we could have just...
vaporized it.

23:30.409 --> 23:32.879
-Maybe if we practice, we...
-Practice?

23:32.912 --> 23:34.981
What? We can do it, we might
as well get better at it.

23:35.014 --> 23:37.083
REED: Eh, you've been given
a gift, and a power like that

23:37.116 --> 23:39.418
could hurt people, you can't
just go around using it...

23:39.452 --> 23:41.621
So we should just stuff it down
and bury it like your dad did?

23:41.654 --> 23:43.222
How'd that work out?

23:43.255 --> 23:44.991
-That's way out of bounds, Andy.
-ANDY: Mom.

23:45.024 --> 23:47.226
It's who we are, okay?
It's who I am.

23:47.259 --> 23:50.530
Andy, sometimes you can't
control your own powers.

23:54.033 --> 23:55.602
ANDY:
I see.

23:55.635 --> 23:57.470
So I'm just
some kind of monster.

23:57.504 --> 23:58.971
That's not what he meant.

23:59.005 --> 24:01.107
At least you guys have one kid
you can actually trust.

24:01.140 --> 24:03.610
Mom...

24:03.643 --> 24:05.812
Let me talk to him.

24:10.216 --> 24:12.184
LAUREN:
Andy...

24:12.218 --> 24:14.453
-Andy!
-What?

24:14.487 --> 24:17.189
You know Mom and Dad are just
trying to protect us, right?

24:17.223 --> 24:18.858
Yeah, yeah, I totally get it.

24:18.891 --> 24:21.160
I'm a freak
because I don't hate my powers.

24:23.329 --> 24:25.865
You think I hated that?

24:27.634 --> 24:30.637
I've never felt so powerful.

24:32.138 --> 24:34.440
It scared me...

24:34.473 --> 24:37.910
because it felt good.

24:40.046 --> 24:42.448
Do you remember that time
that it happened before?

24:42.481 --> 24:44.483
At the park.

24:45.552 --> 24:47.654
-You felt that?
-Yeah. That was before

24:47.687 --> 24:49.789
I even knew I was a mutant.
I mean, I...

24:49.822 --> 24:51.157
That's when I started
messing up at school.

24:51.190 --> 24:53.392
It's 'cause I couldn't get it
out of my mind.

24:53.425 --> 24:55.161
Me, too.

24:58.164 --> 25:01.033
All I want to do right now
is try that again.

25:04.036 --> 25:05.572
Does that mean...

25:05.605 --> 25:07.406
does that mean we're gonna
be like them?

25:07.439 --> 25:08.507
The von Struckers?

25:08.541 --> 25:12.879
Honestly... I don't know.

25:15.414 --> 25:16.883
So this is the substation?

25:16.916 --> 25:18.317
Uh, yeah.

25:18.350 --> 25:21.487
Sage was able to get it using
the guard's system access.

25:21.520 --> 25:23.422
Look, are you sure we can't
take this down ourselves?

25:23.455 --> 25:24.924
I'm good with electronics.

25:24.957 --> 25:26.826
Sage said we get
three minutes tops

25:26.859 --> 25:28.494
before the generators
kick back on.

25:28.527 --> 25:31.030
-We'd never get back
to the lab in time. -(sighs)

25:31.063 --> 25:32.832
Listen, we need to talk
about the other night.

25:32.865 --> 25:34.433
It was a nightmare.
It's nothing.

25:34.466 --> 25:35.735
Nothing?

25:35.768 --> 25:37.536
It's not nothing.

25:37.570 --> 25:41.240
I think all the furniture
in our room would disagree.

25:41.273 --> 25:44.243
-Look, if you're worried
about the baby... -If?

25:44.276 --> 25:47.246
Of course I'm worried
about the baby.

25:47.279 --> 25:48.881
Why?

25:50.216 --> 25:52.952
I'm not sure that this place
is gonna make it.

25:55.221 --> 25:56.623
No matter what,

25:56.656 --> 26:00.192
I will protect you,
and that kid.

26:00.226 --> 26:01.761
That's a promise.

26:01.794 --> 26:05.397
I don't know if that's a promise
you can keep.

26:05.431 --> 26:07.299
(quietly):
What?

26:07.333 --> 26:09.068
Hey.

26:10.737 --> 26:12.404
Am I interrupting?

26:12.438 --> 26:13.640
Yes.

26:13.673 --> 26:15.407
No, it's all right.

26:15.441 --> 26:17.309
-What is it?
-I have an idea.

26:17.343 --> 26:19.746
For the power station,
how to knock it out.

26:19.779 --> 26:21.814
Yeah? What's that?

26:22.749 --> 26:25.718
We use the Strucker kids.

26:25.752 --> 26:28.320
(horn honks in distance)

26:28.354 --> 26:30.723
No, it's-it's probably gonna be
another late night...

26:30.757 --> 26:32.324
PAULA (over phone):
What else is new?

26:32.358 --> 26:34.661
JACE: I know, I know.
Look, I'm sorry. It's just,

26:34.694 --> 26:37.129
we're on to something, here.
We're getting really close.

26:37.163 --> 26:40.332
I-I just don't like
that you're going back to work

26:40.366 --> 26:42.168
-so soon after...
-Babe.

26:42.201 --> 26:44.403
This is exactly
why I have to be here.

26:44.436 --> 26:45.738
This isn't just about me.

26:45.772 --> 26:48.641
I want justice,
for Grace, for all of us.

26:48.675 --> 26:50.943
Just...

26:52.144 --> 26:53.479
...come home safe.

26:53.512 --> 26:54.580
I will.

26:54.613 --> 26:55.815
When the job is done.

26:55.848 --> 26:58.584
When the job's done.

26:58.617 --> 27:00.887
-I love you.
-I love you, too.

27:04.791 --> 27:07.493
What do we got, Ed?

27:07.526 --> 27:09.295
I called in some favors.

27:09.328 --> 27:10.930
(door closes)

27:10.963 --> 27:13.532
I was able to pull together
a team to look into the lab.

27:13.565 --> 27:14.633
All right.

27:14.667 --> 27:16.168
Good job.

27:16.202 --> 27:19.138
Just know: we're out
on the skinny branches here.

27:19.171 --> 27:22.541
An unauthorized investigation
into a covert facility?

27:22.574 --> 27:25.812
If this fails, we're talking
to the FBI in handcuffs.

27:25.845 --> 27:28.147
Then we best not fail.

27:34.486 --> 27:36.122
ECLIPSE: We need you to do
the same thing

27:36.155 --> 27:37.623
to the substation transformers
that you did

27:37.656 --> 27:38.691
to the prison convoy bus.

27:38.725 --> 27:39.992
Now, you don't have to do this.

27:40.026 --> 27:41.360
We know it's a lot
to ask, but...

27:41.393 --> 27:43.629
now we just don't see
another way.

27:43.662 --> 27:44.964
Look, we want to help,

27:44.997 --> 27:46.733
but why does it need to be
Lauren and Andy?

27:46.766 --> 27:47.867
Well, because we need
everyone else

27:47.900 --> 27:49.335
with combat powers
to assault the lab.

27:49.368 --> 27:51.838
Now, we think that we can take
down that power substation

27:51.871 --> 27:53.639
without putting them
at any risk.

27:53.672 --> 27:57.243
So exploding high voltage
transformers is the safe job?

27:57.276 --> 27:59.078
In this case, yes.

27:59.111 --> 28:01.213
ECLIPSE: Sage hacked
the security cameras.

28:01.247 --> 28:02.982
The station only has
a handful of guards.

28:03.015 --> 28:05.484
Clarice will get everyone in.
Sonya will guide them.

28:05.517 --> 28:07.353
THUNDERBIRD:
We've been through every option.

28:07.386 --> 28:08.721
This is the only one that works.

28:10.189 --> 28:11.523
I'm down.

28:11.557 --> 28:13.192
Let's do it.

28:16.462 --> 28:18.164
Okay.

28:18.197 --> 28:21.067
But Caitlin and I need to be the
ones monitoring the security.

28:21.100 --> 28:22.902
If our kids are there,
we are, too.

28:22.935 --> 28:25.171
Look, Sage will set you up,
show you what to do.

28:25.204 --> 28:27.573
THUNDERBIRD: All right,
everybody get ready.

28:27.606 --> 28:29.141
We move out in an hour.

28:39.385 --> 28:42.054
*

28:54.633 --> 28:57.236
(car doors closing)

28:59.438 --> 29:01.273
All right, this is it.
Gate's up there.

29:01.307 --> 29:02.909
We'll go check it out,
see what we're dealing with.

29:02.942 --> 29:05.411
Sounds good.
We'll get the party favors.

29:08.848 --> 29:12.151
-ESME: (gasps) Oh.
-That's a detonator.

29:14.787 --> 29:17.056
Drop it too hard,
this ends quick.

29:17.089 --> 29:19.391
-Sorry.
-You seem a bit jumpy.

29:19.425 --> 29:21.293
Have you ever done anything
like this before?

29:21.327 --> 29:22.161
Not exactly.

29:22.194 --> 29:23.896
Okay, before we go in there,

29:23.930 --> 29:25.297
you got to understand something.

29:25.331 --> 29:28.000
When the shooting starts,
everything changes.

29:28.034 --> 29:29.568
If you're not ready, then I...

29:29.601 --> 29:30.736
I... I am ready.

29:30.769 --> 29:32.338
I just, I slipped. Okay?

29:34.506 --> 29:35.975
Look, if you're here

29:36.008 --> 29:38.978
because you think this is gonna
be some adventure,

29:39.011 --> 29:40.312
you're making a mistake.

29:42.514 --> 29:44.583
(Eclipse shouts)

29:44.616 --> 29:46.152
POLARIS:
Marcos!

29:46.185 --> 29:47.753
(shouting)

29:47.786 --> 29:49.288
(growls, screams)

29:52.658 --> 29:53.759
Hey.

29:53.792 --> 29:56.428
Have you ever been so angry

29:56.462 --> 29:58.530
about someone you love
getting hurt

29:58.564 --> 30:01.167
that you would do anything
to stop the pain?

30:03.069 --> 30:05.304
That's why I'm here.

30:06.538 --> 30:09.842
For the people I love
in that building.

30:09.876 --> 30:12.544
I can't leave them.

30:12.578 --> 30:14.346
They're a part of me.

30:27.393 --> 30:30.963
ECLIPSE: That is a long stroll
from the fence to the building.

30:30.997 --> 30:32.698
Well, we knew
it wouldn't be easy.

30:32.731 --> 30:35.101
Yeah. Says the bulletproof guy.

30:39.338 --> 30:42.374
This would have been so much
easier if we had Pulse with us.

30:42.408 --> 30:43.910
-Yeah.
-He could've taken out

30:43.943 --> 30:46.378
-every automated gun
in that place. -(grunts)

30:46.412 --> 30:49.882
Course, we'd be hearing tales
of his awesomeness for months.

30:49.916 --> 30:52.284
(laughs)
Yeah.

30:54.686 --> 30:57.556
I miss him.

30:58.624 --> 31:00.592
Yeah, me, too. But John,

31:00.626 --> 31:03.495
you weren't the only person
that left him there that night.

31:03.529 --> 31:05.932
That's on all of us,
not just you.

31:05.965 --> 31:08.567
And today,
we get to make it up to him.

31:10.937 --> 31:13.372
(zips bag)

31:15.374 --> 31:17.376
(beeps)

31:17.409 --> 31:18.877
We're in place.

31:18.911 --> 31:20.612
REED:
Copy that. We're en route.

31:20.646 --> 31:22.781
We're almost
at the power substation.

31:22.814 --> 31:24.083
Okay, be safe out there.

31:31.790 --> 31:35.027
What we're doing here,
it's a parent's worst nightmare.

31:35.061 --> 31:37.363
-We can handle...
-Andy, we know.

31:37.396 --> 31:39.131
We know you can.

31:39.165 --> 31:42.168
We're doing this
because we trust you.

31:43.970 --> 31:46.405
Hey, Struckers, heads up.
We're here.

31:53.412 --> 31:55.581
(brakes squeak)

31:58.117 --> 32:00.953
(phone beeps, dials)

32:00.987 --> 32:02.121
Yeah.

32:02.154 --> 32:04.090
-We're ready.
-Okay.

32:04.123 --> 32:06.458
Bypassing firewall.

32:06.492 --> 32:09.128
And you should have picture
in three, two, one.

32:09.161 --> 32:10.796
REED:
Okay. It's working.

32:10.829 --> 32:14.166
SAGE: I looped the camera feeds
so security won't see our team.

32:14.200 --> 32:16.235
But they'll notice eventually,
so be quick.

32:16.268 --> 32:17.503
BLINK:
Okay, guys.

32:17.536 --> 32:19.671
I'm gonna need
some room here, kid.

32:19.705 --> 32:21.173
Uh, yeah.

32:23.542 --> 32:25.077
-ANDY: Bye, Mom. -Okay.
-(Blink grunts)

32:25.111 --> 32:26.245
We got this.

32:26.278 --> 32:27.846
BLINK:
Um, guys?

32:27.879 --> 32:30.649
It's a little trickier
than holding an elevator.

32:30.682 --> 32:32.618
Can we hurry this up please?

32:49.801 --> 32:52.438
WEEKS:
Turner.

32:52.471 --> 32:54.673
We've checked into everything.
No irregularities at the lab,

32:54.706 --> 32:56.008
no alarms, no nothing.

32:56.042 --> 32:57.109
What about lab employees?

32:57.143 --> 32:58.444
Anything unusual going on there?

32:58.477 --> 33:00.112
All the background checks
came back clean.

33:00.146 --> 33:02.214
We've got a guy out of town
for a funeral,

33:02.248 --> 33:03.715
one sick leave...

33:03.749 --> 33:05.451
Who's the sick leave?

33:05.484 --> 33:08.020
Security guard.
Called last night.

33:08.054 --> 33:09.521
Access the Trask
employee network.

33:09.555 --> 33:11.723
Pull up his record.

33:11.757 --> 33:12.991
I think it's a dead end.

33:13.025 --> 33:14.560
Guy passed out in a bar,
bumped his head.

33:14.593 --> 33:16.228
Probably sleeping off
his hangover.

33:16.262 --> 33:18.230
JACE:
Right there.

33:18.264 --> 33:20.799
He accessed information
on the power station.

33:20.832 --> 33:23.635
WEEKS: Power station?
That's miles away.

33:23.669 --> 33:25.037
JACE:
Yeah, but it powers the lab.

33:25.071 --> 33:26.505
They hit that,
they could get in.

33:26.538 --> 33:28.040
-I'll call the lab.
-No. No.

33:28.074 --> 33:29.641
The mutants could be monitoring

33:29.675 --> 33:30.809
communication there--
we're not calling anybody.

33:30.842 --> 33:32.010
We need a tactical team.

33:32.044 --> 33:33.979
Remote units, everything.

33:34.012 --> 33:35.547
We're not gonna be able
to do that under the radar.

33:35.581 --> 33:37.583
I don't care, this is it, man.

33:37.616 --> 33:41.120
I can feel it, okay?
Let's go.

33:52.398 --> 33:55.000
Hey. Can you hear me okay?

33:55.033 --> 33:56.268
We made it inside.

33:56.302 --> 33:58.337
We can hear you just fine.

33:58.370 --> 34:00.439
All right, we're going in.

34:04.410 --> 34:06.011
Hold on.

34:06.044 --> 34:08.480
There are some workers
in the hallway in front of you.

34:10.716 --> 34:12.151
(muffled chatter)

34:14.720 --> 34:17.223
(typing)
Okay...

34:17.256 --> 34:18.490
Okay, you're clear.

34:30.736 --> 34:33.205
Sure you know
where you're going?

34:33.239 --> 34:34.606
Um, pretty sure.

34:34.640 --> 34:36.708
The guard I borrowed
the memory from had only

34:36.742 --> 34:40.712
been here a few times,
so it's a little hazy.

34:40.746 --> 34:42.414
The transformer
we need to take out

34:42.448 --> 34:44.216
is in the middle
of the building.

34:44.250 --> 34:46.552
So why didn't you just
portal us there?

34:46.585 --> 34:48.654
CAITLIN: Hold up, there's
a conference room on your right.

34:49.921 --> 34:51.590
Can you make a portal
through a hundred walls

34:51.623 --> 34:53.259
into a room you've
never seen before

34:53.292 --> 34:55.561
and land safely next to
a high-voltage transformer?

34:55.594 --> 34:57.763
-CAITLIN: Okay, you're clear.
-No.

34:57.796 --> 34:58.764
Yeah. Neither can I.

35:05.003 --> 35:07.939
(monitor beeping)

35:07.973 --> 35:09.841
Incoming,
door to your left.

35:12.778 --> 35:14.246
What are you doing here?

35:14.280 --> 35:18.350
Oh, did they not call?
From the front desk?

35:21.353 --> 35:23.655
No, I didn't get a call.

35:24.823 --> 35:26.091
Hang on just a sec.

35:26.124 --> 35:28.694
Come on.
You remember me.

35:35.534 --> 35:37.503
Or maybe you don't remember.

35:48.046 --> 35:49.248
Reed...

36:02.361 --> 36:04.830
REED:
Nice job, Sonya.

36:07.266 --> 36:08.567
THUNDERBIRD:
All right, remember,

36:08.600 --> 36:10.035
once the Struckers take down
the transformer

36:10.068 --> 36:12.504
at the power station,
we only have three minutes

36:12.538 --> 36:13.972
to get the charges up
by the automated guns

36:14.005 --> 36:15.841
-and get inside of Trask.
-Don't forget about the part

36:15.874 --> 36:18.009
where if we're off by a few
seconds, we all get slaughtered.

36:18.043 --> 36:20.145
-Marcos, not helpful.
-I'm sorry, it's just,

36:20.178 --> 36:21.913
look, once we get in there,
we don't know what we're doing

36:21.947 --> 36:23.148
or where we're going.

36:23.181 --> 36:24.216
Well, that's why she's here.

36:24.250 --> 36:26.385
First, we free the prisoners.

36:26.418 --> 36:28.820
Then we destroy the mainframes
and the research.

36:28.854 --> 36:32.691
Yeah, right.
So these prisoners...

36:32.724 --> 36:33.892
how do you know they're
gonna help us?

36:33.925 --> 36:36.762
Believe me, they'll help.

36:41.700 --> 36:44.202
Okay, uh, the next
few hallways seem clear.

36:44.236 --> 36:46.405
DREAMER:
Got it. Thanks.

36:50.409 --> 36:52.177
(Caitlin sighs)

36:52.210 --> 36:54.079
They're gonna be all right.

36:54.112 --> 36:56.214
Yeah.

36:59.551 --> 37:01.853
When you used to go on busts,
how'd...

37:01.887 --> 37:04.590
how did you deal with it--
the nerves?

37:04.623 --> 37:09.194
The first few times, I...
I threw up.

37:09.227 --> 37:12.531
Really?
You never told me that.

37:12.564 --> 37:14.266
Well, we were still dating.

37:14.300 --> 37:15.634
I was trying to impress you.

37:17.002 --> 37:18.904
I still am.

37:21.573 --> 37:26.878
I found that if I focused
just on my plan,

37:26.912 --> 37:28.547
it got better.

37:28.580 --> 37:31.883
Now, our plan is to watch over
the kids.

37:31.917 --> 37:33.519
To keep them safe.

37:37.356 --> 37:40.258
We'll get through this.

37:41.860 --> 37:43.729
(indistinct chatter)

37:43.762 --> 37:45.564
WEEKS:
Sir, I still don't buy it.

37:45.597 --> 37:46.965
Do you really think
they'd come here?

37:46.998 --> 37:48.400
I thought they were going after
Campbell's lab.

37:48.434 --> 37:50.302
They will. They will.

37:50.336 --> 37:51.637
It's not a coincidence
that the guard

37:51.670 --> 37:53.271
that called in sick
accessed specs

37:53.305 --> 37:55.273
on this power substation.

37:55.307 --> 37:56.742
I'm telling you,
it's the mutants trying

37:56.775 --> 37:58.677
to disable the lab security
before they go in.

37:58.710 --> 38:00.245
Zone 1 is clear.

38:00.278 --> 38:01.747
You're making a lot
of leaps, here.

38:01.780 --> 38:03.682
I mean, if the remote units
don't find anything,

38:03.715 --> 38:05.617
we're done--
you know that, right?

38:05.651 --> 38:07.252
SS TECH 2:
Pushing past Zone 2. All clear.

38:07.285 --> 38:09.921
SS TECH: Zone 3, clear.
Advancing to 4.

38:09.955 --> 38:11.089
Come on...

38:11.122 --> 38:14.360
Sir. Remote unit just targeted.

38:14.393 --> 38:16.094
We've got mutants.

38:16.127 --> 38:18.497
Yes, we got 'em.

38:18.530 --> 38:21.299
We got 'em, we're hot.
Let's go!

38:29.508 --> 38:32.043
Oh, my God.

38:32.077 --> 38:33.845
Wait.

38:33.879 --> 38:36.448
-Oh, my God.
-What is it? What did you see?

38:36.482 --> 38:38.116
Hold on. I...

38:38.149 --> 38:40.151
Oh...

38:40.185 --> 38:43.154
Look! There.

38:43.188 --> 38:45.223
Sonya, get out of there.

38:45.256 --> 38:46.392
Get out of there now!

38:51.162 --> 38:52.964
-CAITLIN: Get out of there!
-Wait, I don't understand.

38:52.998 --> 38:55.667
-What's going on?
-Reed. Look!

38:55.701 --> 38:58.470
There is a Sentinel robot
and arms teams in the building!

38:58.504 --> 39:00.071
Get out of there now!

39:00.105 --> 39:02.140
We got to go. Now.

39:02.173 --> 39:04.543
-What the hell is going on?
-They know we're here.

39:04.576 --> 39:05.977
-They're coming for us.
-JACE: All units move in.

39:06.011 --> 39:07.646
All units move in.

39:07.679 --> 39:09.881
Sir, the Sentinels...
they were destroyed last time.

39:09.915 --> 39:12.918
Not this time. Techs have
been working with them.

39:12.951 --> 39:15.654
They've been learning...
This time, they're ours.

39:15.687 --> 39:18.323
-What about the power
transformer? -There's no time!

39:18.356 --> 39:19.925
Clarice, you gotta get us out.

39:19.958 --> 39:21.727
I don't even know where
we are in this building.

39:21.760 --> 39:24.329
I don't know which direction.

39:24.362 --> 39:26.532
The-the, there's too many
hallways, I don't know.

39:26.565 --> 39:27.733
Hurry, please!

39:27.766 --> 39:30.736
I-I-I know, I'm trying.

39:32.738 --> 39:34.740
Okay. Okay, I got it!

39:34.773 --> 39:37.876
Guys! Guys!
Hey, guys, guys!

39:37.909 --> 39:40.211
-Andy!
-Uh, yeah, m-move, move.

39:40.245 --> 39:43.549
Move!
(groaning, straining)

39:56.762 --> 39:58.063
Run!

40:01.633 --> 40:03.869
DREAMER:
Clarice!

40:03.902 --> 40:04.870
No!

40:04.903 --> 40:08.674
Go! Go!

40:11.309 --> 40:13.278
Reed.

40:13.311 --> 40:16.448
Sonya? Sonya!
Do you copy?

40:16.482 --> 40:17.816
(shrill electric feedback)

40:17.849 --> 40:19.384
We have to go, Reed.
We have to help them!

40:19.417 --> 40:21.319
We can't, we can't go in the
building, we'll get caught.

40:21.352 --> 40:24.422
We can't help them
if we're captured, too.

40:24.456 --> 40:25.624
(alarm blaring)

40:29.294 --> 40:30.762
ECLIPSE:
Hijo de perra...

40:30.796 --> 40:32.931
What happened?
Did somebody see us?

40:35.133 --> 40:36.334
MAN (echoing):
We're on full lockdown!

40:36.367 --> 40:38.169
MAN 2: Mutants tried to hit
the power station.

40:38.203 --> 40:39.571
MAN 3:
Sentinel Services caught 'em,

40:39.605 --> 40:42.273
said we might be next...

40:42.307 --> 40:45.844
No, they're not coming for us.

40:45.877 --> 40:47.112
We got to go.
Operation's blown. Come on!

40:47.145 --> 40:48.680
What? What? No.
No, we-we can't go,

40:48.714 --> 40:50.248
-we have to get in there!
-That's it.

40:50.281 --> 40:52.818
-They have our team at the
substation. -I am not leaving.

40:52.851 --> 40:54.152
-We have to get in there!
-We're going!

40:54.185 --> 40:56.187
-Come on, it's over.
-No! No, please, my family.

40:56.221 --> 40:58.590
-Don't make me leave them
behind! -I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

40:58.624 --> 41:00.926
-Come on.
-No! No...!

41:00.959 --> 41:03.128
WOMAN (over P.A.):
Attention, all employees.

41:03.161 --> 41:05.764
This is not a drill.
The facility is under attack.

41:05.797 --> 41:07.265
Observe full lockdown
procedures.

41:07.298 --> 41:08.800
Repeat: full lockdown procedures
are in effect.

41:08.834 --> 41:11.202
ANDY:
What are we gonna do?

41:11.236 --> 41:12.971
Sage gave me the codes.

41:15.674 --> 41:17.108
(agents shouting)

41:17.142 --> 41:19.545
-ANDY: Come on!
-LAUREN: They're coming!

41:23.314 --> 41:24.683
DREAMER:
Come on, hurry!

41:24.716 --> 41:27.719
-Freeze!
-ANDY: Behind you!

41:27.753 --> 41:29.154
-Run.
-LAUREN: Wait...

41:29.187 --> 41:31.823
-Run!
-ANDY and LAUREN: No, no, no!

41:31.857 --> 41:34.492
AGENT:
Get down on the ground, now!

41:35.594 --> 41:37.729
(alarm blaring)

41:42.734 --> 41:44.169
(indistinct guard chatter)

41:44.202 --> 41:46.805
We can get out.

41:46.838 --> 41:49.307
We can get out if we did
what we did before.

41:49.340 --> 41:50.609
Like Fenris.

42:23.809 --> 42:25.343
-What are you doing?
-We can't...

42:25.376 --> 42:28.013
-We have to! -No. We're in
the basement of the building.

42:28.046 --> 42:29.280
If we do it,

42:29.314 --> 42:31.817
everyone's gonna die.

42:39.557 --> 42:41.893
-Stay where you are!
-(weapons cocking)

42:41.927 --> 42:44.295
-JACE: Andy... Lauren.
-(Lauren gasps)

42:44.329 --> 42:45.897
JACE:
Don't move.

42:47.733 --> 42:50.702
-REED: No.
-CAITLIN: Oh, my God. No!

42:50.736 --> 42:52.303
No, Cait, what are you doing?

42:52.337 --> 42:53.872
-Those are our children, Reed!
-We can't.

42:53.905 --> 42:55.473
We can't.
There's nothing we can do.

42:55.506 --> 42:56.675
It's over.

42:59.344 --> 43:00.712
Get on your knees.

43:00.746 --> 43:03.214
-Reed, we can't just leave them.
-Cait, Cait...

43:03.248 --> 43:04.750
(Caitlin sobbing)

43:04.783 --> 43:06.952
Get on your knees, now.

43:08.086 --> 43:09.955
(mouthing)

43:15.794 --> 43:17.796
(collar powers up)

43:25.370 --> 43:27.405
Oh, my God.

43:27.438 --> 43:30.108
Oh, my God.

Media Access Group at WGBH

44:12.550 --> 44:14.019
* (show theme)

44:14.052 --> 44:15.721
I'm at the regional
headquarters

44:15.754 --> 44:17.555
of the Sentinel Services
downtown,

44:17.588 --> 44:19.557
where a local
mutant rights organization

44:19.590 --> 44:22.227
is protesting something
that many in the community--
Mutants are people!

44:22.260 --> 44:26.297
expected them to support--
a new rehab program designed
to help mutant criminals.

44:26.331 --> 44:29.300
Sentinel Services Cares
is just another way

44:29.334 --> 44:32.537
for Sentinel Services
to track and control mutants.

44:32.570 --> 44:35.173
KING:
The first-of-its-kind program
offers misdemeanor offenders,

44:35.206 --> 44:36.875
who'd otherwise
spend years in prison,

44:36.908 --> 44:39.077
a chance to rejoin
their communities.

44:39.110 --> 44:41.813
As a condition of parole,
participants in the program

44:41.847 --> 44:43.882
agree to wear
a small tracking bracelet.
(beeping)

44:43.915 --> 44:45.751
MAN:
The mutants in our program
know in life

44:45.784 --> 44:49.020
that you have to give
in order to get.

44:49.054 --> 44:50.756
They get an opportunity

44:50.789 --> 44:52.490
to be part of our society.

44:52.523 --> 44:54.926
And the tracker
gives the public

44:54.960 --> 44:56.227
peace of mind.

44:56.261 --> 44:57.729
It's fascism.

44:57.763 --> 45:00.265
KING: A charge the Sentinel
Services firmly denies.

45:00.298 --> 45:04.169
Our goal is to make the world
safer for everyone,

45:04.202 --> 45:08.006
something
the Human Mutant Alliance
should appreciate.

45:08.039 --> 45:11.342
When I relayed the message
to local HMA president
Sheryl Trainor,

45:11.376 --> 45:14.212
she responded, quote,
"A fabricated sense of safety

45:14.245 --> 45:16.581
cannot come at the expense
of mutant liberty,"

45:16.614 --> 45:18.016
end quote.

45:18.049 --> 45:20.018
Some people are hard to please.

People have been fighting
