11:52.021 --> 11:53.437
We were just next door,

11:53.514 --> 11:55.105
how could someone come in
and do this?

11:55.182 --> 11:56.947
Well, break-ins have been
on the rise in the area.

11:57.015 --> 11:58.694
And chances are,
it was just a random hit.

11:58.761 --> 12:00.762
Well, thanks for looking
into it, I appreciate it.

12:00.829 --> 12:02.122
- Of course.
- Thank you, Jim.

12:02.199 --> 12:04.022
I'll see you out.
All right.

12:04.099 --> 12:05.549
Okay, grab some stuff,

12:05.626 --> 12:07.351
you guys aren't staying here
tonight.

12:07.428 --> 12:09.628
I'm not letting someone scare
me out of my home.

12:09.705 --> 12:12.331
- Amy, you can't be serious?
- I am.

12:14.959 --> 12:16.719
Okay...

12:17.175 --> 12:19.376
I'll help you clean up.

12:33.313 --> 12:35.513
Oh, grandpa!

12:42.494 --> 12:45.362
You know, a few days ago, I was
worried about Mary Jane Sutka.

12:45.522 --> 12:48.125
And... that class reunion,

12:48.202 --> 12:50.669
and then something like this
happens,

12:50.746 --> 12:54.074
and it all just seems so silly.

12:54.318 --> 12:55.451
Yeah.

12:57.678 --> 13:00.655
Well, I don't know why you get
yourself so worked up

13:00.723 --> 13:02.381

13:02.458 --> 13:05.617
I know you say she's a big
deal, but...

you're no slouch yourself,
you know.

13:09.089 --> 13:11.023
Thanks, grandpa.

13:12.225 --> 13:13.959
But I don't know about that.

I mean, she has a-a happy,
solid marriage.

13:18.366 --> 13:19.765
It's a big part of her brand.

13:20.835 --> 13:23.168
We both know my marriage
was a total failure.

13:23.245 --> 13:26.205
Okay now, that's where
we disagree.

13:27.308 --> 13:30.108
Any union that could produce
those two beautiful

13:30.185 --> 13:32.402

13:32.479 --> 13:34.947
that's anything but a failure.

I don't know, Lou, you might be
over-thinking things a little.

13:42.255 --> 13:44.848
Okay, from what you say,

13:44.925 --> 13:49.320
this woman's whole business
is based on image,

13:49.397 --> 13:52.064
well, you don't know what
that image is,

13:52.141 --> 13:54.658
it could be a lie,
for all you know.

13:54.735 --> 13:56.593

you saw her?

like? Do you know?

without talking to me first,

services on us and said that

of mine in Mongolia.

23:48.781 --> 23:50.537

23:57.315 --> 23:59.482

you stole from me.

23:59.550 --> 24:01.199
I didn't steal anything!

24:01.267 --> 24:02.858
It fell off the truck
when you drove off,

24:02.925 --> 24:04.482
and left us for dead!

24:07.509 --> 24:09.161
Relax.

24:09.505 --> 24:11.798
I have no intention
of hurting anyone.

your beautiful wife,
and baby alone.

24:18.005 --> 24:19.363

24:19.440 --> 24:20.545
And if I'd found
the backpack,

24:20.612 --> 24:22.319
we wouldn't be having this
conversation now, would we?

24:22.386 --> 24:25.075
It's empty!
Why's it so important?

24:25.405 --> 24:27.489
It has sentimental value.

Well, I don't have it,
all right?

24:31.279 --> 24:33.720
Uh, but I can get it. Okay?

24:33.788 --> 24:35.391
Yeah, I'll call you later

your wife's routines.

24:46.699 --> 24:48.700
You leave my family
out of this, all right?

24:48.886 --> 24:50.109
I'll do what you want.

24:50.177 --> 24:52.036
Yeah, I thought as much.

24:53.668 --> 24:55.468
Until later, then.

- Come on, Clive!

Come here.

- Hey...

- Come on!

25:34.487 --> 25:36.688
- No, that way.
- Yes, good girl.

25:36.837 --> 25:39.220
Yes! Get in there!

25:41.722 --> 25:43.367
One of them's missing.

25:43.518 --> 25:44.906
He'll come back on his own.

25:44.974 --> 25:46.078
No, Ty put me in charge.

25:46.146 --> 25:47.617
I'm not about to lose an animal.

25:47.685 --> 25:49.937
What about the flash drive?
Shouldn't you call Ty?

25:50.249 --> 25:52.840
After we find the lost llama.

25:53.042 --> 25:54.453
Well, count me out.

25:54.521 --> 25:57.088
Nothing good ever comes from us
on an off road vehicle.

25:57.365 --> 26:00.791
See, this is a perfect example
of how opposites don't attract.

26:04.269 --> 26:05.935
I'll be back!

of it for the, for the year.

the break in.

27:05.655 --> 27:08.119

Bye, sweetheart.

35:36.068 --> 35:39.720
Hello? Yes, I have it.

35:41.271 --> 35:43.463
The bridge on 370, yeah.

35:43.563 --> 35:45.697
Okay, I'll be there
in 30 minutes.

35:46.001 --> 35:47.548
You have my word!

35:48.150 --> 35:49.868
Hello?

35:56.228 --> 35:57.587
Lyndy's sleeping.

35:57.655 --> 35:59.748
Thank you so much for looking
after her today, Lou.

35:59.816 --> 36:00.964
It was a big help.

36:01.041 --> 36:02.384
Grandpa and I
got a lot finished.

36:02.452 --> 36:04.512
- Yeah, we sure did.
- Yeah, it was no problem.

36:05.683 --> 36:09.037
- Hey! Is Ty here?
- Uh no, why?

36:09.105 --> 36:10.550
Well, just wondering
if he found out

36:10.617 --> 36:11.857
what that flash drive
was all about.

36:11.925 --> 36:13.004
What flash drive?

36:13.072 --> 36:14.981
We found it in the lining of 
the backpack.

36:14.982 --> 36:17.558
Wait, the backpack that Ty
brought you from Mongolia?

36:17.625 --> 36:19.462
Yeah.

36:19.530 --> 36:20.930
<i>Lou, what's up?</i>

36:21.018 --> 36:22.602
Do you know something?

36:22.888 --> 36:24.813
Not exactly.

36:25.713 --> 36:27.141
What do you know?

36:57.240 --> 36:58.974
Do you have it?

37:03.445 --> 37:05.891
Okay? We good?

37:06.162 --> 37:08.110
Yeah, we're good.

37:08.437 --> 37:10.180
All right.

37:10.688 --> 37:12.487
Now, hold up.

37:15.543 --> 37:17.410
I see you found
the flash drive.

37:17.792 --> 37:20.218
That changes everything.

37:30.530 --> 37:32.864
And you did a pretty bad
repair job.

37:43.109 --> 37:44.677
So you're gonna have
to come with me,

37:44.754 --> 37:45.899
Okay...

37:45.967 --> 37:48.584
until I can be sure
you didn't make a copy.

37:54.228 --> 37:56.662
- All right! All right!
- Get in!

37:57.098 --> 37:59.513
Now this time, you're driving.

38:10.861 --> 38:11.861
Ugh! Oof!

38:17.377 --> 38:19.035
Oof!

38:23.282 --> 38:25.374
- Ugh!
- Hey!

38:25.952 --> 38:27.413
Police! Hands up!

38:27.526 --> 38:29.243
Hands up!

38:29.398 --> 38:32.155
Over here. Now!

38:33.289 --> 38:35.590
You're under arrest.

38:35.878 --> 38:38.515
Jim, right behind you.

38:41.334 --> 38:43.301
Here.

38:57.643 --> 38:59.510
Thanks, guys.

39:06.356 --> 39:08.281
Hey...

39:08.586 --> 39:10.809
Your dad said you wanted
to talk to me?

39:10.991 --> 39:13.348
Look, I just wanna say
the truth is,

39:13.422 --> 39:16.809
you being with Wyatt is going
to bother me just a little.

39:17.045 --> 39:18.879
But I figured
it was inevitable.

39:19.091 --> 39:21.873
Honestly it did
kind of bug me

39:21.941 --> 39:23.340
that you were so okay with it.

39:23.408 --> 39:25.207
I know that sounds crazy,
but...

39:25.275 --> 39:29.094
I just, I want us all to stay
friends, and be normal.

39:29.487 --> 39:31.488
I don't want anything
to change, either.

39:31.612 --> 39:33.669
Wyatt's a good friend,
and so are you.

39:35.065 --> 39:37.457
And about the whole
double dating thing,

39:37.682 --> 39:39.827
I know Olivia's super into it,

39:39.913 --> 39:41.882
and Wyatt's been talking
about it too, I...

39:41.950 --> 39:44.086
I'm with you.
No way is it ever happening.

39:44.184 --> 39:45.553
Okay, great!

39:46.358 --> 39:48.272
So, did you ever find
the original flash drive?

39:48.345 --> 39:49.639
Yes, thank you.

39:49.707 --> 39:51.960
Our team, they recovered it
from the creek,

39:52.210 --> 39:54.827
but it was damaged,
and all the data was lost.

39:55.022 --> 39:57.178
Luckily, Ty had the presence
of mind to make a copy

39:57.246 --> 39:58.382
of its contents.

39:58.450 --> 40:01.421
Now Ellis, he's gonna remain
in custody until his trial.

40:01.599 --> 40:03.213
And based on the evidence,

40:03.281 --> 40:04.906
it looks good for a conviction.

40:04.974 --> 40:06.407
Well, it's good to hear that.

40:06.475 --> 40:08.791
And the names on the flash
drive?

40:09.021 --> 40:10.346
Well, those individuals,

40:10.423 --> 40:12.749
they're all part of an exotic
animal trading network.

40:12.914 --> 40:15.665
All the information Ty gave us
has been sent to RCMP.

40:15.733 --> 40:17.267
So they're gonna take it
from here,

40:17.335 --> 40:19.292
but it will lead to more
arrests.

40:19.421 --> 40:20.803
Well, that's good.

40:20.871 --> 40:23.311
This wouldn'tve happened without
Georgie and Adam, though.

40:26.726 --> 40:28.394
Thanks, guys.

40:31.744 --> 40:34.225
- Hey, thanks for coming.
- Yeah, no problem.

40:34.524 --> 40:37.108
I want to check in on Ty
and Amy, anyway.

40:37.280 --> 40:40.022
This whole thing about the
poacher guy is kind of wild.

40:40.139 --> 40:42.587
Yeah, it's been a surreal
couple of days.

40:43.862 --> 40:46.077
But speaking of surreal...

40:46.437 --> 40:48.971
we should probably talk
about what happened.

40:49.039 --> 40:50.689
Yeah, I know.

40:50.757 --> 40:52.658
It was kinda crazy, I mean,

40:52.726 --> 40:55.810
we both got caught up
in the moment, right?

40:55.886 --> 40:58.254
Well, you were pretty worked
up about that whole...

40:58.354 --> 41:01.680
- Mary Jane thing.
- I wasn't that worked up.

41:02.637 --> 41:05.696
Okay, I admit,
I had a couple too many.

41:05.773 --> 41:08.057
Well, you've got a lot
going on right now.

41:08.705 --> 41:10.792
And it's an emotional time,
with your dad, and all.

41:10.859 --> 41:12.908
Yeah, it is.

41:13.627 --> 41:15.057
But I still think that...

41:15.163 --> 41:17.041
It should never have
happened.

41:17.297 --> 41:19.723
- What?
- The truth is, um...

41:21.400 --> 41:23.111
I'm seeing someone.

41:23.313 --> 41:26.539
You-you're what?

41:26.999 --> 41:28.467
- What's funny about that?
- Nothing.

41:28.544 --> 41:31.221
It's not funny, I'm sorry,
I've just been...

41:31.504 --> 41:33.638
Scott, I've been so stressed
since we kissed.

41:33.706 --> 41:34.947
What about?

41:35.015 --> 41:37.441
I have made so many
bad decisions.

41:37.695 --> 41:39.543
Especially when it comes
to relationships.

41:39.611 --> 41:41.569
And I just, I was worried
that you thought...

41:41.637 --> 41:43.229
Look, Lou.

41:43.470 --> 41:46.821
You need to stop worrying about
what everyone else thinks.

41:47.261 --> 41:50.000
You got a lot of good things
going on in your life.

41:50.827 --> 41:52.680
You have great kids.

41:52.956 --> 41:55.227
You're a successful
businesswoman.

41:55.652 --> 41:57.352
You and your ex get along.

41:57.420 --> 42:00.446
So don't apologize
for your choices.

42:01.099 --> 42:02.524
Own them.

42:03.960 --> 42:05.627
You're amazing,

42:07.764 --> 42:10.430
and you'll find that
right person eventually.

42:10.768 --> 42:12.269
If that's what you want.

42:13.563 --> 42:16.070
Thank you.
That means a lot.

It lifted a weight
off my shoulders,

I really rushed
things with Mitch.

42:53.622 --> 42:55.897
I jumped into that relationship
way too fast

42:55.965 --> 42:57.833
after the breakup with Peter.

42:58.149 --> 43:01.426
And honestly, I think I need
