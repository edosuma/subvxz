00:00.305 --> 00:02.352
<i>Previously on "Another Period"...</i>

00:02.352 --> 00:03.520
I was kidnapped

00:03.586 --> 00:05.422
<i>and I was forced to have sex on camera.</i>

00:05.490 --> 00:07.091
Ah. You've come for me.

00:07.157 --> 00:08.225
- Beatrice.
- Beatrice.

00:08.291 --> 00:09.926
Beatrice, you're a slut. Smile.

00:09.993 --> 00:11.629
Beatrice is a vacant, useless whore,

00:11.696 --> 00:13.197
and that's all she'll ever be.

00:13.263 --> 00:16.800
You're just jealous because
I'm a star and you're not.

00:26.377 --> 00:27.545
What's the point of living

00:27.612 --> 00:29.447
when Beatrice is famous and I'm not?

00:39.023 --> 00:41.859
Oh, Cutie, what's the point of anything

00:42.179 --> 00:43.425
when people you don't even care about

00:43.493 --> 00:45.691
don't know your name
or anything about you?

00:45.770 --> 00:47.999
Let's kill ourselves together.

00:48.066 --> 00:51.702
Going to miss our custom-made
suicide outfits.

00:51.768 --> 00:53.836
Come get me, train.

00:58.797 --> 01:00.447
- Ah.
- What in....

01:01.544 --> 01:03.347
Hey, if you're trying to kill yourself,

01:03.413 --> 01:06.388
this train ain't coming through
here again till Tuesday.

01:06.951 --> 01:07.662
Shit.

01:07.955 --> 01:10.211
Here, give this a read. Kill some time.

01:10.920 --> 01:14.458
I apologize for its stickiness,
but that Beatrice Bellacourt...

01:14.524 --> 01:18.327
ooh, she makes it flow,
if you feel me, huh?

01:25.902 --> 01:28.705
Oh, and you might want
to try lying diagonal.

01:28.771 --> 01:31.207
Train'll shred you up
real good that way.

01:31.274 --> 01:32.609
Worked on my wife.

01:32.675 --> 01:35.412
"Lucky Chang's Casino."
_

01:35.479 --> 01:36.549
It's a sign.

01:37.014 --> 01:38.883
Who was that dirty angel?

01:39.240 --> 01:42.808
Cutie, there's no problem that
gambling can't solve.

01:43.830 --> 01:45.699
Chinese-town, here we come.

01:57.625 --> 02:00.774
Synced and corrected by hawken45
for www.addic7ed.com

02:12.884 --> 02:14.184
How about this one, Mother?

02:14.250 --> 02:16.218
Eww. Still too gummy.

02:16.285 --> 02:18.695
This is how a lady smiles.

02:21.759 --> 02:23.994
Faces are hard.

02:24.061 --> 02:26.429
Eww. Frederick got present
skin on me. Get it off.

02:26.497 --> 02:27.898
Get it off.

02:27.964 --> 02:29.306
- Very sorry, Madam.
- Ugh.

02:29.307 --> 02:32.035
Master Frederick, where did
you get all these presents?

02:32.103 --> 02:34.738
Oh, these are simply expensive
gifts that I'm accepting

02:34.804 --> 02:37.131
in exchange for political favors.

02:38.374 --> 02:41.479
This one is from the Buffalo Society.

02:41.545 --> 02:43.047
They want to put a buffalo
on the new nickel,

02:43.113 --> 02:45.481
and they need my vote.

02:45.548 --> 02:47.885
There's going to be a new
design on the nickel?

02:47.951 --> 02:49.486
Beatrice.

02:49.553 --> 02:52.154
This is the chance
we've been waiting for.

02:52.222 --> 02:54.790
You know I was the original model

02:54.857 --> 02:56.559
for the Statue of Liberty.

02:56.627 --> 02:58.062
You're not green, Mother.

02:58.129 --> 03:01.131
Of course, I didn't
get to be the statue.

03:01.198 --> 03:02.625
I missed my chance.

03:03.034 --> 03:04.735
But I won't miss yours.

03:05.171 --> 03:08.123
Beatrice, you're going to be on money.

03:10.073 --> 03:11.242
Beatrice.

03:11.308 --> 03:12.660
I wasn't, I wasn't.

03:16.546 --> 03:17.916
I was just sitting here.

03:36.766 --> 03:38.468
I've come to drown my sorrows

03:38.535 --> 03:40.818
in the sweet delights
of the game of chance.

03:42.272 --> 03:44.574
Is this Lucky Chang's Casino?

03:44.641 --> 03:46.150
Welcome to America.

03:47.177 --> 03:47.996
Hello.

03:48.845 --> 03:49.660
I'm rich.

03:50.914 --> 03:52.716
Do you speak English?

03:52.783 --> 03:54.111
Is this the right place?

03:55.920 --> 03:59.581
Luck be a lady.
You, my dear, are beautiful.

04:00.833 --> 04:01.859
I know that look.

04:02.285 --> 04:03.450
Sibling problems?

04:04.664 --> 04:05.762
You wouldn't understand.

04:06.963 --> 04:08.231
You'd be surprised.

04:08.298 --> 04:10.933
Perhaps a game of Fan Tan
would cheer you up?

04:11.375 --> 04:13.393
Why don't you stay and play with us?

04:14.568 --> 04:15.539
"Us"?

04:15.606 --> 04:16.940
I'm Chang.

04:17.007 --> 04:18.576
This is Eng.

04:19.372 --> 04:19.887
Hi.

04:20.577 --> 04:22.309
Guess how many spines we have.

04:23.279 --> 04:24.380
It's two,

04:24.448 --> 04:27.178
and then one, and then two again.

04:28.051 --> 04:31.889
Mm... Siamese.

04:31.955 --> 04:33.758
If Beatrice is going
to get on the nickel,

04:33.825 --> 04:35.793
she needs to look her best.

04:35.859 --> 04:38.962
So I've ordered the latest in
beautification technology

04:39.029 --> 04:40.220
for her makeover.

04:40.697 --> 04:42.867
The goal is to make you
look as much like

04:42.933 --> 04:45.469
a corpse as possible without
actually killing you.

04:45.536 --> 04:46.670
What is this thing, anyway?

04:46.736 --> 04:48.138
Oh, it's an X-ray machine.

04:48.205 --> 04:50.006
It takes pictures of your bones.

04:50.572 --> 04:52.875
That's what servants use it for.

04:52.943 --> 04:56.354
Real people use it to make their
skin pale and sallow.

04:56.981 --> 04:58.782
Garfield, stop looking at my bones,

04:58.849 --> 04:59.916
you pervert.

04:59.983 --> 05:01.285
I would... I wouldn't never...

05:01.351 --> 05:04.020
I would never
look at anyone's bones.

05:04.087 --> 05:05.440
What are you doing?

05:06.289 --> 05:08.558
Just figuring out how much
cyanide to inject you with.

05:08.625 --> 05:11.095
Oh, for God's sake,
man, just eyeball it.

05:11.161 --> 05:14.964
The poison will bring out the
ocean-blue color in your veins.

05:15.032 --> 05:17.912
Oh! Oh, it burns, it burns.

05:19.335 --> 05:21.371
Garfield, is the bee box ready?

05:21.841 --> 05:23.241
- Mm-hmm.
- There's a buzzy in there?

05:23.306 --> 05:25.741
Ah. To make your lips fuller.

05:25.808 --> 05:27.911
This will make you appear more

05:27.977 --> 05:29.692
willing and fertile.

05:39.722 --> 05:42.698
Presenting the new Beatrice.

05:43.739 --> 05:44.695
Oh.

05:44.762 --> 05:49.257
Beatrice, you look positively
cadaverous.

05:49.641 --> 05:52.575
I... I know. It's like, is
she dead already?

05:52.653 --> 05:53.567
Let me see.

06:01.756 --> 06:04.614
Mother, I never thought I
could look so beautiful.

06:04.855 --> 06:07.383
And it only hurt a lot.

06:07.450 --> 06:10.653
Beauty is as painful as childbirth,

06:10.721 --> 06:13.519
dear, but far more rewarding.

06:14.152 --> 06:16.527
I believe you're ready.

06:16.594 --> 06:19.762
I'll arrange an artist
to draw your entry

06:19.830 --> 06:21.767
for the nickel competition.

06:22.065 --> 06:23.500
Oh, thank you, Mother.

06:23.566 --> 06:25.235
- What?
- Thank you.

06:25.301 --> 06:26.335
Thank you.

06:26.937 --> 06:28.169
Thank... thank you, Mother.

06:28.201 --> 06:29.305
Choo-choo.

06:29.373 --> 06:30.341
Thank you.

06:30.407 --> 06:31.474
Tink ee.

06:31.541 --> 06:32.510
Thank you, Mother.

06:32.577 --> 06:33.882
Crimps.

06:35.119 --> 06:36.188
Thank you, Mother.

06:36.189 --> 06:38.782
It seems that people only value
me for the way I look,

06:38.849 --> 06:41.944
which is great, because I
thought I had no value.

06:45.041 --> 06:45.591
Ow.

06:54.376 --> 06:56.378
Winning number is four.

06:56.399 --> 06:57.601
Oh. I won.

06:57.666 --> 06:58.638
Just like that.

06:59.169 --> 07:01.389
This is almost as easy as being
born rich and beautiful.

07:01.390 --> 07:02.917
That's the magic of Fan Tan.

07:02.918 --> 07:05.075
Where the wand goes, the money grows.

07:05.508 --> 07:06.680
I don't need money.

07:06.867 --> 07:09.279
Oh, you don't play Fan Tan
for the money.

07:09.346 --> 07:11.348
You play it for the rush.

07:11.782 --> 07:13.483
If we really wanted

07:13.549 --> 07:16.902
to make money, we should have
went to podiatry school.

07:16.902 --> 07:17.520
Okay.

07:17.587 --> 07:18.821
Enough about the podiatry school.

07:18.888 --> 07:20.723
Feet are recession-proof.

07:20.791 --> 07:21.925
It's a lost art

07:21.991 --> 07:22.992
that some people don't appreciate.

07:23.060 --> 07:24.171
Shh.

07:24.640 --> 07:28.855
We actually play Fan Tan to
forget our troubles.

07:29.166 --> 07:30.601
I totally understand.

07:30.666 --> 07:32.268
I have troubles, too.

07:32.335 --> 07:33.944
My sister is famous.

07:34.404 --> 07:35.806
Beatrice Bellacourt?

07:36.205 --> 07:38.031
Oh, I've... I've never heard of her.

07:38.409 --> 07:39.877
You haven't? Really?

07:39.943 --> 07:41.376
Oh, that's great news.

07:41.377 --> 07:42.645
Yes, you have, Chang.

07:42.712 --> 07:43.647
We just saw her movie.

07:43.714 --> 07:45.516
I said I never heard of her.

07:45.582 --> 07:47.437
Beatrice Bellacourt is your sister?

07:47.438 --> 07:49.786
Whew, she has beautiful blonde hair.

07:49.852 --> 07:52.088
But you have dark hair,
like a Chinese woman.

07:52.156 --> 07:53.891
But you also have white skin,
like a white woman.

07:53.957 --> 07:55.256
Worst of both worlds.

08:00.740 --> 08:03.500
Being the Vice President of
the "Oosa" has its advantages,

08:03.566 --> 08:06.336
<i>and one of those is getting my own copy</i>

08:06.402 --> 08:09.605
<i>of Beatrice's erotic nickelodeon.</i>

08:09.673 --> 08:12.176
I've got my Italian oil,

08:12.743 --> 08:14.311
my velvet sperm catcher,

08:14.945 --> 08:17.589
and my carafe of cocoa.

08:19.282 --> 08:20.597
Finally.

08:24.854 --> 08:26.001
Oh.

08:32.929 --> 08:34.017
God...

08:37.133 --> 08:39.071
<i>Freddie? What's going on in there?</i>

08:39.289 --> 08:40.703
Oh. Uh, nothing.

08:40.770 --> 08:43.539
Uh, g... uh, I wasn't doing anything.

08:43.607 --> 08:44.642
Just one second.

08:47.311 --> 08:48.420
Just one second.

08:52.715 --> 08:53.788
One second.

08:55.953 --> 08:57.185
Just one second.

08:59.355 --> 09:01.160
Just one second.

09:06.596 --> 09:07.668
One second.

09:11.033 --> 09:12.905
Just one second. One second.

09:14.738 --> 09:16.065
Just one second.

09:17.240 --> 09:18.544
Just one second.

09:23.280 --> 09:24.983
Uh, just one second.

09:28.852 --> 09:29.512
Oh.

09:35.492 --> 09:37.248
What are you doing in here?

09:37.960 --> 09:41.152
I... well, I was masturbating.

09:41.764 --> 09:42.181
No.

09:42.182 --> 09:45.861
I... wasn't... I was...

09:46.902 --> 09:48.090
Masturbating...

09:48.370 --> 09:50.706
to a moving picture of my sister.

09:50.773 --> 09:52.756
No. I was not. I was, uh...

09:52.977 --> 09:55.178
Oh, think of
something. I was...

09:55.244 --> 09:56.613
I... you see this?

09:56.680 --> 09:59.000
I was... Maass...

09:59.249 --> 10:00.177
Tur...

10:01.218 --> 10:02.553
Bating.

10:04.921 --> 10:06.556
Oh, whew.

10:06.623 --> 10:07.657
Whew, that was close.

10:13.092 --> 10:16.035
Ah. No. That was a birthday
present from myself.

10:16.599 --> 10:18.514
Another loss for the white ghost.

10:21.470 --> 10:23.833
One diamond tiara on number four.

10:24.239 --> 10:25.642
I tell you, as long as I'm
playing Fan Tan,

10:25.709 --> 10:27.106
Beatrice doesn't exist.

10:27.677 --> 10:29.794
I can understand hating your sibling.

10:30.446 --> 10:32.323
Do you hate our sister Bethany?

10:33.516 --> 10:35.355
Not who I was talking about.

10:36.186 --> 10:37.754
How do you deal with it?

10:37.820 --> 10:40.933
Rich inner life. And Fan Tan.

10:41.843 --> 10:43.025
You're a natural, Lillian.

10:43.093 --> 10:44.627
I am pretty good, aren't I?

10:44.694 --> 10:45.996
I mean, I know I'm losing now,

10:46.062 --> 10:47.496
but I tell you, ever since
I've been playing Fan Tan,

10:47.564 --> 10:48.932
I haven't been able to
think of anything else.

10:48.998 --> 10:50.300
How could she be a natural?

10:50.367 --> 10:52.413
Fan Tan's entirely a game of chance.

10:52.414 --> 10:53.268
It just means

10:53.269 --> 10:56.742
Lillian is a very skilled
Fan Tan player, Eng.

10:57.240 --> 10:59.109
But there's absolutely
no skill involved.

10:59.176 --> 11:01.022
She just lost her last four bets.

11:01.279 --> 11:03.847
And the winning number is... three.

11:03.913 --> 11:06.949
Ah.

11:07.017 --> 11:08.118
Last five bets.

11:08.185 --> 11:09.986
Well, I have a feeling

11:10.052 --> 11:11.697
your luck is about to turn.

11:12.321 --> 11:15.042
Wait, so... so you do
understand that it's all luck?

11:15.459 --> 11:16.760
Uh...

11:16.825 --> 11:18.262
Now I'm really confused.

11:18.328 --> 11:19.396
You know, I'm going to do you a favor

11:19.461 --> 11:20.696
and take my break now.

11:20.763 --> 11:22.643
What? You get a break?

11:23.166 --> 11:24.401
Five minutes without Fan Tan?

11:24.468 --> 11:25.922
What am I going to do?

11:26.903 --> 11:29.178
I have one idea.

11:55.632 --> 11:57.845
My treatments made me very beautiful,

11:57.846 --> 11:59.137
but then I thought,

11:59.138 --> 12:01.470
"What if I was very, very, beautiful?"

12:01.537 --> 12:05.108
Or even very, very beautiful?

12:38.208 --> 12:39.642
<i>♪ I'm on the money ♪</i>

12:39.709 --> 12:42.445
<i>♪ When you look at money,
you'll see me ♪</i>

12:42.512 --> 12:45.348
<i>♪ Me, I'm on the money ♪</i>

12:45.415 --> 12:48.819

13:02.432 --> 13:05.567
Ahh!

13:05.634 --> 13:09.972
Beatrice.

13:10.040 --> 13:13.410
Ah. Fan Tan.

13:33.856 --> 13:37.426
Today, the artist I retained
is coming to draw Beatrice's

13:37.426 --> 13:39.841
portrait for her official submission

13:39.841 --> 13:41.776
to the Nickel Selection Committee.

13:41.844 --> 13:43.346
Now, Pablo,

13:43.413 --> 13:45.980
we are hoping for a very
traditional, very classic

13:46.048 --> 13:47.649
rendition of Beatrice.

13:47.716 --> 13:50.787
It is my great pleasure to
paint the beautiful

13:50.852 --> 13:52.221
Bellacourt daughter.

13:52.288 --> 13:53.847
She's very beautiful.

13:54.789 --> 13:56.034
Oh.

13:56.826 --> 13:59.327
My God. Oh, this... here she is.

14:00.629 --> 14:02.298
What have you done
to yourself?

14:02.365 --> 14:04.674
I made myself over and over and over.

14:05.567 --> 14:07.544
Do I look beautiful?

14:08.303 --> 14:09.504
Um...

14:09.571 --> 14:10.688
You're, uh...

14:11.038 --> 14:15.177
Uh, Beatrice, this is, uh,
Pablo the Spaniard.

14:15.244 --> 14:16.184
Um.

14:16.912 --> 14:19.370
An honor to meet you, Miss Bellacourt.

14:20.481 --> 14:22.483
Ah. Your hand is boiling hot.

14:22.551 --> 14:23.653
God damn it.

14:23.720 --> 14:24.473
Really?

14:24.953 --> 14:28.456
'Cause I feel so cold...
so very, very cold.

14:28.524 --> 14:30.926
Oh.

14:30.993 --> 14:33.062
Let's just begin, please.

14:33.128 --> 14:34.338
Take a seat, take a seat.

14:34.424 --> 14:36.885
- Here we go.
- Here we go.

14:37.200 --> 14:38.467
- Yes.
- Right.

14:44.506 --> 14:48.443
Oh, come along, Beatrice.

14:48.509 --> 14:52.146
There's my star. Beautiful girl.

14:52.674 --> 14:54.116
You're a star.

14:55.271 --> 14:56.144
Smile.

14:57.052 --> 14:59.654
Okay...

14:59.721 --> 15:01.216
This is no... um...

15:02.424 --> 15:03.422
Smile.

15:04.343 --> 15:05.238
Okay, great.

15:07.495 --> 15:08.963
You know, maybe I should just go.

15:09.030 --> 15:11.632
It's only a 40-day boat
ride back to Spain.

15:11.700 --> 15:13.655
Pablo, don't be ridiculous.

15:13.655 --> 15:15.923
You'll look fabulous, darling.

15:23.199 --> 15:25.350
Ow. Uh oh.

15:26.302 --> 15:27.003
Oy.

15:28.698 --> 15:29.808
This one's gone.

15:30.381 --> 15:32.625
Eh. I will just finish this quickly...

15:32.707 --> 15:33.292
Oh!

15:37.046 --> 15:39.412
I...<i> dios mío</i>.

There she is.

15:47.921 --> 15:50.436
Hey, you stole our money.

15:50.437 --> 15:52.026
I don't really need your
judgment right now.

15:52.093 --> 15:52.963
I need support.

15:52.964 --> 15:54.327
Come on, number four.

15:54.512 --> 15:56.289
Specifically, I need $20,000

15:56.290 --> 15:58.032
to keep riding on this Fan Tan train.

15:58.098 --> 15:59.447
Come on, number four.

15:59.448 --> 16:02.485
Let's get out of here, Eng. Ah!

16:02.486 --> 16:04.305
I know what you're
going through, Lillian.

16:04.372 --> 16:06.774
You and I, we're the same on the inside.

16:06.840 --> 16:08.839
Except for having all your organs.

16:09.210 --> 16:10.981
You've always stood in the way
of my dreams,

16:11.169 --> 16:12.442
or at least to the right of them.

16:12.443 --> 16:13.334
Maybe you're the one

16:13.335 --> 16:15.014
who's always stood in
the way of my dreams.

16:15.015 --> 16:16.015
Ever think about that?

16:16.888 --> 16:20.212
I've been waiting my whole
life to be free of you,

16:20.618 --> 16:21.463
Chang.

16:24.314 --> 16:24.892
Fine.

16:25.775 --> 16:27.341
Good luck in podiatry school.

16:27.497 --> 16:28.929
We'll see how you do without me.

16:28.996 --> 16:30.564
Oh, this won't end well.

16:30.623 --> 16:31.445
Good-bye.

16:33.093 --> 16:34.023
Damn it.

16:34.144 --> 16:35.086
Damn it.

16:36.901 --> 16:39.214
Don't worry. That's just our pants.

16:39.215 --> 16:41.004
- Oh.
- Happens all the time.

16:42.042 --> 16:43.009
Good-bye, Chang.

16:43.077 --> 16:44.797
- I'm Eng.
- I'm Chang.

16:47.814 --> 16:49.023
Looks like I'm all out of money.

16:49.024 --> 16:49.672
Yeah.

16:50.234 --> 16:52.126
What do you think about
me gambling on credit?

16:52.127 --> 16:53.527
You know, for an old friend.

16:53.528 --> 16:54.622
Didn't you tell me

16:54.623 --> 16:56.657
it made you happy that Chinese people

16:56.724 --> 16:58.551
couldn't become American citizens?

16:58.552 --> 17:00.076
Well, I'd just lost a big bet,

17:00.077 --> 17:02.301
and I do think it's a sensible policy.

17:02.668 --> 17:03.769
I have an idea.

17:13.256 --> 17:15.073
This dress is worth $5,000.

17:15.074 --> 17:16.606
More than your family's life.

17:17.554 --> 17:20.279
Lillian's winning streak starts now.

17:20.280 --> 17:21.442
Come on, number four.

17:21.443 --> 17:23.417
Come on, number four.

17:28.644 --> 17:29.712
Did I get it, Mama?

17:30.123 --> 17:31.654
Am I going to be on money?

17:32.076 --> 17:32.935
No.

17:32.936 --> 17:34.144
You didn't get the coin.

17:34.145 --> 17:36.698
You lost out to a buffalo.

17:36.765 --> 17:39.700
I knew you'd ruin this for me again.

17:39.766 --> 17:42.804
Well, maybe I can be on
another America thing.

17:43.478 --> 17:44.465
Like... Like a flag.

17:44.570 --> 17:45.632
Or an eagle.

17:46.642 --> 17:48.583
It's over, Beatrice.

17:49.280 --> 17:51.887
I'm dropping you as a client.

17:53.613 --> 17:55.698
But... but I'm your main daughter.

17:56.250 --> 17:58.619
So much hard work to
get you on the coin,

17:58.686 --> 18:02.556
and all we have to show for it
is this awful drawing

18:02.785 --> 18:05.554
by that no-talent Spaniard.

18:07.552 --> 18:08.856
No.

18:11.038 --> 18:11.957
Frederick.

18:12.933 --> 18:15.235
Frederick, you voted for me, didn't you?

18:15.236 --> 18:18.808
Oh, my dear sweet Beatrice, of
course not.

18:18.809 --> 18:20.249
I got a better bribe from the buffalo.

18:21.575 --> 18:22.344
Beatrice?

18:22.452 --> 18:23.249
What?

18:23.803 --> 18:25.372
Did you get a new dress?

18:26.691 --> 18:27.343
Yes.

18:28.510 --> 18:30.023
Still got it.

18:40.416 --> 18:41.094
Ah!

18:41.595 --> 18:44.738
May you have four daughters
and live far away from a river.

18:44.739 --> 18:45.462
Argh!

18:46.406 --> 18:47.410
Help.

18:51.023 --> 18:52.024
Officers.

18:52.602 --> 18:54.174
- Officers.
- Oh.

18:54.240 --> 18:56.002
Oh, well, look at this.

18:56.283 --> 19:00.247
Ooh, a young harlot, and she's
totally naked.

19:00.314 --> 19:01.855
I can see her forearms.

19:03.517 --> 19:04.216
Officers.

19:04.529 --> 19:06.915
I'd like to report an illegal
gambling parlor.

19:06.917 --> 19:09.625
And how would a fine
young lady such as yourself

19:09.627 --> 19:11.729
know about an illegal gambling parlor?

19:12.120 --> 19:13.542
I wandered in by accident.

19:13.543 --> 19:16.086
Right, and I suppose you'll
have us believe

19:16.087 --> 19:17.767
that's where you lost your dress?

19:17.768 --> 19:18.526
Ho-ho.

19:19.042 --> 19:21.401
It is actually where I lost my dress.

19:21.468 --> 19:24.682
Where is this so-called
"illegal gambling parlor," then?

19:24.683 --> 19:25.962
Well, it's right here.

19:27.030 --> 19:28.209
I'll show you.

19:28.815 --> 19:31.711
Come. Right this way.

19:33.538 --> 19:35.362
Well, welcome to Lucky Miceli's.

19:35.363 --> 19:36.229
How many in your party?

19:36.230 --> 19:38.051
Where did it go? Where's Fan Tan?

19:38.119 --> 19:39.936
Fan Tan. It was right here.

19:40.248 --> 19:41.221
You were there.

19:41.222 --> 19:44.319
Uh, this is an Italian restaurant.

19:44.320 --> 19:45.241
See the garlic?

19:45.242 --> 19:47.799
Classic Italian restaurant décor.

19:47.800 --> 19:49.944
The ravioli wrangler's got a point.

19:49.945 --> 19:50.931
But you don't understand.

19:50.932 --> 19:53.001
I went to the train tracks to
lie across them,

19:53.066 --> 19:54.669
and then a dirt angel gave me a
sticky newspaper,

19:54.735 --> 19:56.591
and inside that newspaper was a
sign that said

19:56.592 --> 19:58.406
I could change my luck, and I
needed to change my luck,

19:58.471 --> 19:59.940
because, well, my sister Beatrice

20:00.007 --> 20:01.068
is a famous pornographic actress
and I'm not famous at all,

20:01.069 --> 20:03.811
so then I went to the Fan Tan
parlor and I met these

20:03.878 --> 20:05.913
Siamese twins, and one of them
wanted to become famous

20:05.979 --> 20:07.913
like me, so I went home with
him, but then his brother

20:07.914 --> 20:09.549
wanted to go to podiatry school,
and he wouldn't stop playing

20:09.616 --> 20:11.184
the clarinet, and then I
couldn't stop thinking about

20:11.251 --> 20:13.620
Fan Tan, so I stole their money
and came back to the casino

20:13.687 --> 20:15.156
and then they came, and they
were so upset, they got

20:15.222 --> 20:17.491
into a huge fight, and then
they... their organs ripped,

20:17.558 --> 20:19.393
but it wasn't really their
organs, it wa...

20:19.460 --> 20:21.194
it was just their pants, and
then I bet my dress

20:21.262 --> 20:23.264
because I couldn't stop thinking
about Fan Tan, and I

20:23.331 --> 20:25.213
just needed to play more Fan Tan.

20:25.698 --> 20:27.515
But I bet you get this all the time.

20:28.994 --> 20:31.029
Why don't you come with us, dear?

20:31.197 --> 20:33.223
To someplace you can relax.

20:33.665 --> 20:35.908
No, no, I just need to play
a little more Fan Tan.

20:35.909 --> 20:37.715
- Come with us.
- Put $50 on number four.

20:37.716 --> 20:39.079
$100 on number three.

20:39.147 --> 20:40.381
Fan Tan. Fan Tan.

20:40.535 --> 20:41.969
Where are we going?

20:42.075 --> 20:43.977
- Where are you taking me?
- Whew.

20:47.487 --> 20:49.668
_

20:51.758 --> 20:54.157
Fan Tan. Fan Tan. Where are
you taking me?

20:55.000 --> 20:58.103
_

20:58.126 --> 21:00.134
<i>Where are you taking me?</i>

21:01.305 --> 21:02.806
We simply want to live in a world

21:02.873 --> 21:06.161
where we are free to practice
our beliefs as we see fit.

21:07.177 --> 21:08.383
You've got a deal.

21:08.384 --> 21:10.143
Ha-ha.

21:11.785 --> 21:13.554
Oh. That's a cute hat.
