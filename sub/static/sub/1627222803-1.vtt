- [Barry] Hey, Milt.

04:56.088 --> 04:57.435
- Look what just came
in from Amazon.

04:58.332 --> 04:58.884
- That's a nice camera.
- It sure is.

04:59.989 --> 05:03.993
It takes still pictures and
video. 1080 and 4K.

05:04.580 --> 05:05.857
Dude, look at this lens.

05:06.616 --> 05:07.065
- You're never gonna get a girl

05:08.135 --> 05:08.342
if you keep shooting at 'em
with distance lenses.

05:09.067 --> 05:09.481
You gotta go talk to her, man.

05:10.379 --> 05:12.657
- Yeah, I know, but the
price was right.

05:16.316 --> 05:18.973
[playful music]

05:22.563 --> 05:23.840
- How do you do it? - Do what?

05:24.772 --> 05:26.360
- Dude, I work my ass
off all summer,

05:27.292 --> 05:27.706
can barely have anything
to show for it,

05:28.742 --> 05:31.296
yet you're able to buy these
crazy stupid gizmos.

05:31.883 --> 05:32.435
Like, I don't get it.

05:33.402 --> 05:34.334
- You ever hear of a
credit card, Barry?

05:34.817 --> 05:37.406
[both chuckle]

05:38.648 --> 05:39.097
How long you gotta work today?

05:40.270 --> 05:42.549
- Not long if he doesn't get
back to scrubbin' the dock.

05:43.239 --> 05:43.515
- [Barry] Hey, Mr. Lennings.

05:44.413 --> 05:44.620
- Don't "hi" me. What
are you doin'?

05:45.690 --> 05:46.725
- Talking to my friend. - Is
it break time yet?

05:47.381 --> 05:47.623
- Not for another hour.

05:48.589 --> 05:49.038
- Then you shouldn't be
running your mouth.

05:49.763 --> 05:51.109
Get back to work! - Yes, sir.

05:51.489 --> 05:52.144
- And you!

05:52.628 --> 05:53.007
- My name's Milt.

05:53.870 --> 05:54.354
- I don't care if
it's James Dean.

05:55.182 --> 05:56.217
Are you renting a boat here?
- No.

05:56.942 --> 05:57.736
- How about a jet ski? - Nope.

05:58.599 --> 05:59.428
- Do you own a boat
in the marina?

06:00.187 --> 06:00.705
- No! - Then you're trespassing.

06:01.809 --> 06:04.364
Get the hell outta here and stop
bothering the help.

06:05.468 --> 06:06.400
- See you later, Barry.

06:07.021 --> 06:07.643
- See you later, Milt.

06:08.540 --> 06:09.265
- [sighs] Do you like
your job here?

06:10.404 --> 06:12.130
- Not really, I mean, I barely
even make minimum wage.

06:13.338 --> 06:15.892
- It doesn't matter! I'm paying
you to work, now get busy!

06:16.341 --> 06:17.169
- Yes, sir.

06:20.897 --> 06:22.002
Crazy tight ass.

06:23.866 --> 06:26.213
- And don't ever let me hear
you call me crazy.

06:50.582 --> 06:52.550
[sighs]

06:54.379 --> 06:57.486

Operative Bosswell.

08:28.818 --> 08:30.130
- [sighs] You do it, Parks.

08:30.993 --> 08:32.683
I don't wanna deal with
her right now.

08:33.340 --> 08:34.962
I have, I have a headache.

08:35.411 --> 08:36.412
- Whatever.

08:36.895 --> 08:38.309
[computer chirps]

08:39.173 --> 08:41.831
- Yes. What do you
have to report?

08:42.970 --> 08:44.489
- The shark stays in the area.

08:45.490 --> 08:47.527
It has not left the
vicinity of the cove,

08:48.286 --> 08:50.046
the drilling rig and Cat Island.

08:51.082 --> 08:53.498
- Like any predator, it's
staking its territory.

08:54.223 --> 08:55.604
I'm sure it won't stray too far.

08:56.536 --> 08:58.745
We have to monitor it,
day and night.

08:59.228 --> 08:59.539
- Yes, ma'am.

09:00.609 --> 09:02.542
If we notice any
irregularities in its patterns,

09:03.266 --> 09:05.096
we'll notify you immediately.

09:05.579 --> 09:06.028
- You do that.

09:07.029 --> 09:08.271
If we don't have any
incidents with the shark,

09:09.238 --> 09:11.309
we can continue outside
drilling operations,

09:11.896 --> 09:13.380
without interference.

09:13.863 --> 09:14.588
- Interference?

09:15.244 --> 09:15.693
- Yes, the authorities.

09:16.659 --> 09:18.454
EPA and all those other
protective agencies

09:19.662 --> 09:22.562
that would shut us down if they
knew the scope of our work.

09:22.872 --> 09:23.666
- I see.

09:24.598 --> 09:25.737
We'll keep you informed.

09:26.186 --> 09:26.980
Signing off.

09:27.877 --> 09:28.222
[computer chirps]

09:28.947 --> 09:30.293
- Well, that didn't go so badly.

09:30.984 --> 09:33.089
- Until something goes wrong.

09:34.332 --> 09:35.989
Then she'll come down on our
heads like a hammer.

09:36.990 --> 09:38.163
- They don't pay us
enough for this crap.

09:38.819 --> 09:39.199
I mean, how are we supposed

09:40.062 --> 09:40.683
to keep this shark
out of trouble?

09:41.408 --> 09:42.512
There's hundreds in the area.

09:43.375 --> 09:45.654
- Yes, but this
shark is special.

09:47.448 --> 09:50.935
[distant boat horn blows]

09:59.460 --> 10:00.841
- Think it's time for break.

10:02.084 --> 10:03.913
- I agree. Let's take five.

10:04.604 --> 10:05.984
- No, no, no. Let's take 15.

10:23.450 --> 10:26.936
[smooth electronic music]

10:30.422 --> 10:33.909
[smooth electronic music]

10:35.289 --> 10:36.187
Now that's where we
should be right now.

10:37.290 --> 10:42.262
With them, enjoying the sun,
instead of baking in it.

10:43.194 --> 10:43.573
- They're 19, we're in our 40s.

10:45.092 --> 10:45.852
- So?

10:47.060 --> 10:49.062
- So, their rich daddy
might not approve.

10:50.477 --> 10:50.650
- I'd rather deal with that

10:51.720 --> 10:53.169
than the poor conditions we
have to work under.

10:53.929 --> 10:54.964
- Rig work is always dangerous.

10:55.896 --> 10:57.001
You knew what you were
signing on for.

10:57.726 --> 10:58.519
- I've been on a lot of rigs.

10:59.451 --> 11:01.522
This is way more dangerous
than the others.

11:02.972 --> 11:05.423
I've never seen a drill the size
of the one they're using.

11:06.562 --> 11:07.459
It's unwise to bore
the ocean bottom

11:08.150 --> 11:09.461
with a thick gauge like that.

11:10.670 --> 11:12.741
- Are you afraid the rig is
going to collapse? Fat chance.

11:13.811 --> 11:16.123
- Anything is possible. -
You worry too much.

11:17.297 --> 11:20.162
Just keep your mouth shut, work
hard without complaint,

11:21.059 --> 11:22.785
and cash the paycheck
every Friday.

11:24.718 --> 11:27.894
[tense orchestral music]
[water swashes]

11:28.377 --> 11:30.724
[shark snarls]

11:31.587 --> 11:33.623
- Look at the size
of that shark!

11:34.245 --> 11:35.418
- Sharks always want rigs.

11:36.523 --> 11:39.112
They know when the food scraps
get dumped overboard.

11:39.837 --> 11:41.459
- Don't you agree how big it is?

11:44.289 --> 11:45.877
- Hard to tell from
this far out.

11:47.016 --> 11:47.810
It's gone now, anyhow.

11:48.777 --> 11:51.365
Hey, let's get back to it.
Break's over.

11:55.645 --> 11:56.681
- [Dodds] What's so special
about this shark,

11:57.302 --> 11:58.718
besides its abnormal size?

11:59.270 --> 11:59.511
- It's prehistoric.

12:00.409 --> 12:02.376
- Newsflash: all sharks
are prehistoric.

12:03.446 --> 12:05.517
- You're not following me. They
dug down too deep!

12:06.656 --> 12:09.729
They hit a frozen cavern. It was
in there and escaped.

12:10.626 --> 12:10.764
- That's crap.

12:11.834 --> 12:13.871
No animal can survive that
long in any cavern,

12:14.526 --> 12:15.907
or under any condition.

12:16.425 --> 12:16.839
- This one did.

12:17.875 --> 12:20.532
It's 10 times larger than any
known shark alive.

12:21.464 --> 12:23.363
It's already killed a
score of folks.

12:23.743 --> 12:24.088
- Really?

12:24.951 --> 12:27.160
- Yeah, some kids, some
petty thieves.

12:27.712 --> 12:28.782
Caused a big stir.

12:29.714 --> 12:31.336
It got blamed on a
rogue Great White.

12:32.337 --> 12:33.787
But if anyone knew that
Bosswell's operations

12:34.892 --> 12:37.101
were responsible for the
killings, it'll be all over.

12:37.860 --> 12:40.276
For her, the operation, and us.

12:41.243 --> 12:41.761
- Why don't they hire
anyone to kill it?

12:42.831 --> 12:44.660
- [Parks] It would attract way
too much attention.

12:45.316 --> 12:46.144
Didn't you ever see "Jaws"?

12:47.352 --> 12:49.630
- Maybe it'll swim out to sea
and migrate somewhere else.

12:50.493 --> 12:51.598
- That's what
Bosswell is hoping.

12:52.081 --> 12:52.357
[computer chirps]

12:53.358 --> 12:55.395
- [Dodds] Speaking of which,
there she is.

12:55.878 --> 12:56.396
[computer chirps]

12:56.845 --> 12:57.777
- This is Parks!

12:58.398 --> 12:59.882
- Anything new to report?

13:01.056 --> 13:01.781
- The shark made a move
towards the rig,

13:02.851 --> 13:04.784
but then it quickly
disappeared back to the cove.

13:05.854 --> 13:08.580
I think the drill might be
causing it some confusion.

13:08.995 --> 13:09.443
- Possibly.

13:10.513 --> 13:12.515
Sharks react to sounds and
vibrations in the water.

13:13.344 --> 13:14.172
- Yeah, the drilling
attracts it,

13:15.070 --> 13:16.519
but then the penetrating
drives it away.

13:17.451 --> 13:19.039
A built-in electric fence,
so to speak.

13:19.729 --> 13:20.523
- That's a good calculation.

13:21.524 --> 13:23.354
The drilling can't be
stopped for any reason.

13:24.010 --> 13:24.665
There's a lot at stake here.

13:25.597 --> 13:27.496
We have to find that oil
bed at all costs.

13:28.566 --> 13:31.155
Our investors want results and
they want them now.

13:31.672 --> 13:31.880
- I understand.

13:32.950 --> 13:35.124
Protecting the rig is our
number one priority.

13:36.160 --> 13:39.025
- It's much more than that.
Keep me updated.

13:40.060 --> 13:41.682
- Yes, will do. Signing off.

13:42.165 --> 13:42.822
[computer chirps]

13:43.408 --> 13:45.065
- At all costs? Even us?

13:45.997 --> 13:48.103
- Don't worry. You're
not worth much.

13:48.482 --> 13:48.793
- Thanks.

13:49.759 --> 13:51.347
- Do some data on the
route of the shark

13:51.934 --> 13:52.832
in the last 48 hours.

13:53.591 --> 13:58.596
- You got it. [keyboard clacks]

14:56.723 --> 14:57.275
- What's gotten into ya, kid?

14:58.138 --> 14:58.380
- There was a shark
in the water.

14:59.588 --> 15:01.486
- What about it? There's sharks
all over the waters here.

15:02.177 --> 15:02.487
- No, no. This was different.

15:03.419 --> 15:04.110
This was bigger than any
shark I ever seen.

15:05.042 --> 15:05.732
- You've been out in
the sun too long.

15:06.767 --> 15:08.769
And what makes you an expect
on marine life, huh?

15:09.356 --> 15:09.598
- No, no. No, no, no.

15:10.564 --> 15:11.496
I know what I saw. This
thing was a monster.

15:12.532 --> 15:13.843
- Well, someone left a
monster bowel movement

15:14.810 --> 15:16.191
in the men's room that
needs unclogging.

15:16.605 --> 15:17.433
See to it.

15:18.296 --> 15:19.711
"Monster sharks."

15:23.681 --> 15:25.165
That kid's on crack.

[shark growls]

19:14.567 --> 19:15.671
[phone rings]

19:16.569 --> 19:19.192
- Nina Bosswell,
Special Operations.

19:20.883 --> 19:23.334
Yes, there are no
concerns as of yet.

19:25.336 --> 19:28.891
The shark is in the vicinity but
it has not posed a problem.

19:29.858 --> 19:31.066
No, it is not contained.

19:31.998 --> 19:34.345
We have to handle this
very carefully.

19:37.106 --> 19:38.970
I do understand the shark could
cause unwanted attention

19:40.006 --> 19:42.526
to the project, but I have
it under control.

19:42.905 --> 19:43.803
Trust me.

19:46.081 --> 19:47.324
Drilling has increased
at four times

19:48.048 --> 19:48.980
the original speed and depth.

19:49.878 --> 19:52.191
I hope to find the oil
bed very soon.

19:54.020 --> 19:54.883
Thank you.

19:55.228 --> 19:56.022
Goodbye.

19:57.920 --> 19:59.681
We'd better find that oil.

20:01.234 --> 20:03.892
[water swashes]

20:06.239 --> 20:07.378
- Oh, look at this one.

20:09.380 --> 20:10.692
Oh, and that one.

20:11.279 --> 20:13.212
Oh, she... She liked me.

20:15.835 --> 20:16.663
Oh, her.

20:18.078 --> 20:19.148
- Looks like you had a
really good day.

20:19.804 --> 20:21.081
I bet you strained your ass.

20:22.013 --> 20:23.394
- That's not all I strained.
[chuckles]

20:24.050 --> 20:27.536
[brooding rhythmic music]

20:44.588 --> 20:46.141
Hey, what's going on over there?

20:47.349 --> 20:49.489
- I don't know, but I bet Mr.
Lennings isn't gonna like it.

20:50.456 --> 20:52.561
- Wait, that's the news
anchor from WJAZ27.

21:10.821 --> 21:11.408
- Dang it!

21:11.925 --> 21:13.168
Nosy reporters!

21:13.651 --> 21:13.824
- Good afternoon.

21:14.928 --> 21:16.551
I'm reporting live from the
Catsman Cove Marina,

21:17.517 --> 21:19.070
site of where the stolen
painting is believed

21:20.071 --> 21:22.211
to be transported from by
three convicts.

21:23.212 --> 21:25.870
Most, if not all, have
reportedly been killed.

21:26.492 --> 21:27.838
The real mystery remains.

21:28.459 --> 21:29.115
Where did the painting go?

21:30.254 --> 21:32.981
Was it treason? Was there more
than one party involved?

21:34.051 --> 21:36.709
And is the painting, much like
the thieves, doomed?

21:37.779 --> 21:39.332
While the painting has not
yet been recovered,

21:40.437 --> 21:43.992
some of the thieves have, or at
least parts of them.

21:44.406 --> 21:44.958
Yes, parts.

21:45.890 --> 21:47.547
It is believed that a
man-eating shark

21:48.272 --> 21:48.617
has been roaming these waters

21:49.825 --> 21:52.034
and may have attacked the group
as they traversed the cove

21:52.966 --> 21:55.797
to go and hide the
painting on Cat Island.

21:59.041 --> 21:59.490
- Oh, man, here comes Mr.
Lennings.

22:00.491 --> 22:01.803
- What the hell do you
think you're doing?

22:02.735 --> 22:03.943
- A news spot on the
painting thieves.

22:04.806 --> 22:05.254
- We have nothing to
do with that.

22:06.394 --> 22:08.913
- The suspects chartered a boat
from this marina, sir.

22:09.397 --> 22:09.569
- That's slander.

22:10.639 --> 22:12.434
My marina is not home to any
criminal activity.

22:13.332 --> 22:14.643
Now scram, before I
call the cops.

22:15.368 --> 22:17.370
- Whatever. Let's pack it up.

22:18.820 --> 22:21.616
- I'll have your job, missy. And
you too, camera guy.

22:33.144 --> 22:36.147
[suspenseful music]

22:37.183 --> 22:38.667
- You better hide.

22:41.429 --> 22:42.222
- Did you see that?

22:42.568 --> 22:42.947
- Yeah.

22:43.672 --> 22:44.121
- Well, why didn't you stop 'em?

22:45.191 --> 22:46.710
They're spreading bad
publicity about the marina.

22:47.849 --> 22:48.988
- I didn't know what they were
doing. I'm not security.

22:49.540 --> 22:49.747
- Well, you are now.

22:50.714 --> 22:51.680
No unauthorized personnel
at the marina,

22:52.578 --> 22:53.579
including those dang
nosy reporters.

22:54.752 --> 22:56.996
- All right, I got you, man.
What did they want, anyway?

22:57.479 --> 22:57.893
- Never you mind.

22:58.998 --> 23:01.000
You just keep your eyes peeled
and get back to work.

23:03.416 --> 23:05.901
[Barry sighs]

23:09.353 --> 23:09.629
- Jeez, that was all weird.

23:10.561 --> 23:11.873
- Not as weird as what I
saw the other day.

23:12.321 --> 23:12.736
- Say what?

23:13.737 --> 23:15.635
- I saw a gigantic shark.
This thing was huge.

23:16.325 --> 23:16.567
- Sharks can get pretty big.

23:17.499 --> 23:18.397
Especially if they're
the alpha male.

23:19.018 --> 23:19.328
- No, no, no, no, no.

23:20.468 --> 23:20.813
This thing was like something
out of a monster movie.

23:21.917 --> 23:23.781
- I didn't know those crooks
rented a boat from here.

23:24.610 --> 23:24.851
- Mr. Lennings
wouldn't admit it,

23:25.887 --> 23:27.923
but a couple days ago, I saw
some shady guys.

23:28.890 --> 23:30.374
They had something wrapped
up in a blue tarp.

23:31.133 --> 23:31.617
It must have been the painting.

23:32.411 --> 23:32.756
- Didn't he know who they were?

23:33.653 --> 23:34.447
It's been all over the
news for days.

23:35.552 --> 23:38.244
- Look, as long as they pay in
cash, he doesn't care.

23:39.590 --> 23:39.935
I wonder what happened to it,
though.

23:41.074 --> 23:42.351
- They're probably across the
Canadian border by now.

23:43.456 --> 23:45.389
- No, the reporter said they
saw pieces of them.

23:46.355 --> 23:47.356
I wonder if the monster
shark I saw got 'em.

23:47.943 --> 23:48.254
- I mean, it's possible.

23:49.497 --> 23:51.360
A house fly could capsize the
tugboats your boss rents out.

23:52.465 --> 23:55.157
But more importantly, what
happened to the painting?

23:56.089 --> 23:58.540
- Well, they either hid
it on Cat Island,

23:59.783 --> 24:02.579
or it's at the bottom of the
channel between here and there.

24:03.372 --> 24:04.753
- I wonder how much it's worth.

24:05.305 --> 24:06.203
- Millions, maybe?

24:07.135 --> 24:07.376
What're you getting at?

24:08.377 --> 24:09.758
- If we could find it ourselves,
we'd be rich.

24:10.897 --> 24:12.968
- You're nuts. If we found it,
we'd have to return it.

24:13.728 --> 24:14.798
Or we'd be criminals ourselves.

24:15.799 --> 24:16.800
There's probably a reward
for it, though.

24:17.283 --> 24:18.215
- Already on it.

24:20.528 --> 24:20.976
[chuckles] Whoa!

24:21.908 --> 24:25.256
It's a $25,000 reward
for its return.

24:25.809 --> 24:26.326
We need to find it.

24:27.396 --> 24:28.432
- How? We don't even have a
boat to get us there.

24:29.537 --> 24:30.814
- There are hundreds around
here, and I happen to know

24:31.918 --> 24:33.161
someone who has access to every
single one of them.

24:33.886 --> 24:34.887
- No way, man. I'll lose my job!

24:35.750 --> 24:36.371
- Oh, you're right. No,
you're right.

24:37.337 --> 24:40.479
Work all summer for like
three bucks an hour,

24:41.031 --> 24:42.101
or split 25 grand.

24:42.860 --> 24:43.620
- If we even find the painting!

24:44.103 --> 24:44.552
- We'll find it.

24:45.553 --> 24:46.346
- Well, I occasionally
have to test drive

24:47.002 --> 24:48.417
the boats after maintenance.

24:49.626 --> 24:50.419
We could get it out for
two hours, tops.

24:50.937 --> 24:51.386
- Not enough time.

24:52.421 --> 24:52.767
- Well, it'll have to be,
unless you wanna sell

24:53.802 --> 24:54.493
all your gizmos and gadgets
so we can rent one.

24:55.666 --> 24:58.566
- All right, all right, point
taken. When can we start?

24:59.187 --> 24:59.428
- All right, so look.

25:00.395 --> 25:02.190
They'll be done repairs
around mid-morning.

25:03.640 --> 25:04.641
We should be able to take one
out this afternoon.

25:05.642 --> 25:07.367
- All right, I'll see you in
a couple of hours.

25:13.753 --> 25:15.583
- [sighs] Man, I got a bad
feeling about this.

25:16.100 --> 25:19.034
[ominous tones]

25:19.552 --> 25:22.210
[water swashes]

25:23.625 --> 25:26.110
- Wasting our time here. The
shark is playing games.

25:27.284 --> 25:28.561
- Only time will tell. In
the meantime...

25:29.320 --> 25:31.806
[computer chirps] Oh, guess who?

25:32.323 --> 25:32.600
[computer chirps]

25:33.842 --> 25:35.534
- We are increasing the speed
and the depth of the drilling.

25:36.880 --> 25:39.158
We need to make sufficient
progress and a
breakthrough soon.

25:40.228 --> 25:42.195
The increased activity should
keep the shark away.

25:43.438 --> 25:45.544
- It must be doing the trick.
We're not picking anything up.

25:46.579 --> 25:49.340
- What do you mean "not
picking anything up"?

25:50.238 --> 25:51.860
- It's off the sensor. Inactive.

25:52.551 --> 25:52.792
- Sharks are always moving.

25:54.035 --> 25:57.556
They don't stop swimming or
disappear. Check your equipment!

25:58.557 --> 25:59.558
- Maybe a fisherman
caught and killed it.

26:00.628 --> 26:02.975
- Unlikely. This shark is one
tough son of a bitch.

26:04.183 --> 26:06.116
- Hold on a moment. Dodds, link
in with the sonar system.

26:07.117 --> 26:09.084
- Got it. This'll only
take a few seconds.

26:09.809 --> 26:11.673
[computer bleeps] We're up now.

26:12.225 --> 26:13.364
- What do you see?

26:14.987 --> 26:17.852
- There it is, south side of the
grid. Far from the rig.

26:18.369 --> 26:20.199
- Most excellent.

26:22.097 --> 26:27.068
[waves crash] [melancholy music]

[shark growls]

29:41.400 --> 29:43.264
[waves crash]

29:44.472 --> 29:46.267
- Okay, Stan, this will be part
two of our location piece.

29:47.302 --> 29:48.510
Just split the segments up
with a commercial

29:49.166 --> 29:50.029
when you edit them together.

29:50.616 --> 29:52.376
- [Stan] You got it.

29:53.067 --> 29:53.377
- The ocean. [ominous music]

29:54.585 --> 29:58.003
Behind me, it looks inviting,
serene and safe, but is it?

29:58.762 --> 29:59.383
We have received several reports

30:00.246 --> 30:00.971
of a shark prowling
these shores,

30:02.214 --> 30:04.147
and while this isn't uncommon,
these reports claim the shark

30:05.389 --> 30:09.014
is in fact monstrous, ranging
from 50 to 60 feet in length,

30:09.877 --> 30:10.981
larger than any known
Great White.

30:12.155 --> 30:13.225
Does the sudden appearance have
anything to do with the

30:14.467 --> 30:17.160
increased drilling at the newly
renovated rig just offshore?

30:18.230 --> 30:20.301
The EPA is still trying to
get accurate reports

30:21.164 --> 30:21.958
on just how far they
are drilling,

30:23.062 --> 30:24.650
and at what cost to the
environment this will have.

30:25.789 --> 30:27.549
Is the rig hiding a secret and
is there any connection

30:28.757 --> 30:32.037
to the mysterious monster
supposedly prowling the depths?

30:32.969 --> 30:33.452
- That bitch.

30:34.453 --> 30:35.972
She'll regret poking
around in our affairs

30:36.904 --> 30:39.389
if she continues
spreading those stories.

30:39.872 --> 30:42.323
[waves crash]

30:43.980 --> 30:46.983
[joyful piano music]

31:42.314 --> 31:43.832
- [Roy] Two sugars?

31:46.732 --> 31:48.251
- No more, no less.

31:57.674 --> 31:59.918
- I heard some of the other
workers talking topside.

32:00.988 --> 32:02.990
A few of the others have seen
the same shark I have.

32:03.922 --> 32:05.716
- You're not still on that,
are you?

32:06.372 --> 32:07.028
- It's in the news as well.

32:07.960 --> 32:09.134
- Sailors and seafarers
have been seeing

32:09.824 --> 32:11.274
sea serpents for centuries.

32:11.999 --> 32:14.587
Too much sun, too much booze.

32:15.071 --> 32:16.348
Too much grass.

32:18.074 --> 32:18.937
- I'm just saying.

32:19.592 --> 32:20.179
- And what are they saying?

32:21.180 --> 32:23.251
- Sightings of a shark or
a marine animal,

32:23.838 --> 32:25.564
50 to 60-feet-long.

32:27.117 --> 32:29.568
- Then it isn't your shark. They
don't grow that big.

32:30.431 --> 32:32.398
- What I saw looked
like a shark.

32:33.468 --> 32:36.126
- Sharks were 60-feet-long in
the Jurassic times,

32:36.609 --> 32:37.576
but not today.

32:38.197 --> 32:39.785
- But maybe one survived.

32:40.682 --> 32:42.132
- Impossible.

32:42.477 --> 32:42.857
- Why?

32:44.031 --> 32:46.757
- Nothing can hibernate for
millions of years and live.

32:47.344 --> 32:48.138
- Maybe one did survive.

32:49.277 --> 32:52.556
Maybe it got trapped in some
suspended animated state.

32:54.075 --> 32:55.870
Maybe we freed it accidentally
with our secretive drilling.

32:56.836 --> 32:58.977
- Now that kind of talk
will get you fired.

33:00.357 --> 33:01.634
- But it could be possible.

33:02.981 --> 33:03.636
- I still say no.

33:04.706 --> 33:07.295
Jurassic life died out with
a mass extinction.

33:07.916 --> 33:09.366
- Dinosaurs died out.

33:10.057 --> 33:12.300
Whales, sharks, alligators?

33:13.474 --> 33:16.718
They're older than the dinosaurs
and they're still alive.

33:18.168 --> 33:21.551
- True, but they're not the size
of a battleship, either.

33:22.483 --> 33:23.691
How they survived is a mystery,

33:24.864 --> 33:27.108
but they adapted and got
smaller, not stay the same size.

33:28.178 --> 33:30.905
- You have a very closed mind
about these matters.

33:31.975 --> 33:34.426
- And you live in a fantasy
world of young ladies

33:35.082 --> 33:36.773
and prehistoric sharks.

33:37.808 --> 33:38.533
- You may be wrong, you know.

33:39.396 --> 33:41.467
- Not this time. I
don't think so.

33:41.950 --> 33:43.400
[shark growls]

33:43.918 --> 33:45.437

[suspenseful music]

33:53.514 --> 33:55.067
- Lennings speaking. What is it?

33:56.413 --> 33:58.553
Yeah, I've heard the reports.

33:59.796 --> 34:01.556
No, I haven't seen any
shark in the water.

34:02.971 --> 34:04.387
I don't care what the dang
news lady said.

34:05.457 --> 34:07.976
This marina is safe and so are
you and your boats.

34:10.393 --> 34:15.362
Well, um, I've put extra
security on duty and, um...

34:16.882 --> 34:18.400
I hired a sharpshooter from the
deepest part of Africa.

34:19.471 --> 34:22.197
Kill any shark that even comes
close to the marina.

34:22.784 --> 34:23.061
Yeah, come on down.

34:24.234 --> 34:26.822
Bring your friends and family
and have a good time. Bye.

34:28.135 --> 34:31.034
[sighs] Man.

34:32.070 --> 34:34.693
[sighs] This crap's gonna
ruin my business.

34:39.974 --> 34:42.045
[grunts]

34:52.193 --> 34:55.161
[suspenseful music]

35:28.712 --> 35:28.988
- All right, what's the plan?

35:30.197 --> 35:31.439
- The channel between here and
Cat Island isn't very deep,

35:32.509 --> 35:34.235
so I'm thinking you pull me
along in the boat,

35:35.098 --> 35:35.512
I'll keep an eye out
for the tarp

35:36.548 --> 35:37.825
that the painting was supposed
to be wrapped in,

35:38.446 --> 35:38.895
and if I don't find it,

35:39.999 --> 35:41.691
then we'll just hit up Cat
Island and search it out.

35:42.209 --> 35:43.141
- That's the plan?

35:43.451 --> 35:44.003
- Hey!

35:44.763 --> 35:46.213
Where are you taking that boat?

35:46.765 --> 35:49.699
[boat engine hums]

35:50.941 --> 35:51.528
- What?

35:52.046 --> 35:52.667
I can't hear you!

35:53.254 --> 35:53.703
- I thought I told you

35:54.704 --> 35:56.533
I didn't want your friend
hanging around here!

35:57.914 --> 35:58.880
- We'll be back soon, all right?

36:00.054 --> 36:02.781
We're taking it for a test
drive. Just got out the shop!

36:09.857 --> 36:13.481
- Dumb kid. He's fired at the
end of his shift this week.

36:14.068 --> 36:15.552
[suspenseful music]

36:16.381 --> 36:18.383
Look at this mess he
left behind.

36:19.625 --> 36:20.833
All someone has to do
is trip on this

36:21.696 --> 36:23.629
and I'll be in court
getting sued.

36:24.251 --> 36:27.875

36:57.353 --> 37:02.254
[shark growls]
[suspenseful music]

37:14.646 --> 37:15.302
- Stop, stop!

37:15.785 --> 37:16.510
- What is it?

37:17.304 --> 37:18.926
- I saw something in the water!

37:19.306 --> 37:20.134
- Well?

37:20.997 --> 37:21.860
- It was, it was huge!

37:22.861 --> 37:25.760
It was the shape of
something hard to define.

37:26.623 --> 37:27.314
- It was probably just a
submerged log.

37:28.384 --> 37:30.696
- Or your monster shark. Maybe
this was a bad idea.

37:31.801 --> 37:33.251
- Look, shark or not, we gotta
keep pressing on.

37:34.079 --> 37:34.424
I could get fired over this,
man.

37:35.598 --> 37:37.600
Would you grow a set, would you?
You gotta keep looking.

37:38.566 --> 37:40.844
- All right, yeah. I
guess you're right.

37:47.989 --> 37:49.784
[computer chirps]

37:50.716 --> 37:51.993
- [sighs] I think the
shark is bored.

37:53.063 --> 37:55.203
- What a coincidence. I feel
the very same way.

37:55.825 --> 37:56.135
- It's not moving much,

37:57.344 --> 37:59.380
but it's still far enough from
the rig to warrant concern.

38:00.347 --> 38:01.209
- Maybe the drilling's
keeping it away.

38:02.038 --> 38:03.142
I sure wouldn't want
to be around

38:03.798 --> 38:04.937
if they stopped working now.

38:05.421 --> 38:06.353
[computer chirps]

38:07.285 --> 38:08.562
- So what's the story
on the shark?

38:09.459 --> 38:10.978
- It's not real active
at the moment.

38:12.013 --> 38:14.602
- Well, we may have trouble
of another sort.

38:15.085 --> 38:15.362
- What's that?

38:16.363 --> 38:17.709
- A nosy reporter is
connecting the dots

38:18.399 --> 38:20.436
between the shark and our rig.

38:21.368 --> 38:22.714
- What would you like us
to do about it?

38:23.577 --> 38:25.061
We can take care of it,
if you'd like.

38:25.958 --> 38:26.925
- For the moment,
we'll leave it be,

38:28.029 --> 38:31.516
but in the near future, we may
have to deal with it.

38:32.586 --> 38:33.069
- Very good, then.

38:34.173 --> 38:36.866
We'll notify you if the shark
changes direction.

38:37.315 --> 38:37.591
- Thank you.

38:38.661 --> 38:41.319
Your hard work and dedication
won't go unrewarded.

38:42.320 --> 38:42.975
[computer chirps] - Who's
she talking to?

38:43.493 --> 38:44.183
You or both of us?

38:45.253 --> 38:47.980
I mean, I should be rewarded
too, don't you think?

38:48.981 --> 38:51.812
- Pipe down. She's just
giving us lip service.

38:52.433 --> 38:53.814
- That's not real nice.

38:54.987 --> 38:59.992
[somber music] [waves crash]

39:30.368 --> 39:32.818
- Should about do it. It's
almost dinner time.

39:33.785 --> 39:37.478
- All you think about is food.
[chuckles]

39:38.099 --> 39:39.791
- Get a load of this!

39:41.068 --> 39:41.965
What is all that stuff?

39:42.828 --> 39:43.795
- It's a special
lubricant solution

39:44.485 --> 39:45.175
that the drill is filled with.

39:46.073 --> 39:47.902
Keeps it from
overheating and snapping.

39:48.489 --> 39:49.525
- Is that stuff safe?

39:50.940 --> 39:53.218
- As long as you're not burning
trash or smoking near it,

39:53.805 --> 39:54.875
it's pretty harmless.

39:55.807 --> 39:56.704
- Good to know.

40:07.508 --> 40:12.479
[shark snarls] [ominous music]

[waves crash]

40:32.360 --> 40:33.603
[engine revs]

40:34.155 --> 40:35.053
- What's going on?

40:36.330 --> 40:38.194
- The engine died. Damn it,
our mechanic sucks.

40:38.781 --> 40:39.713
- Well, try it again!

40:40.472 --> 40:43.993
[boat buzzes] [switch clicks]

40:44.338 --> 40:44.718
- Great.

40:45.822 --> 40:47.479
Just great. We might as well
just start looking here.

40:47.859 --> 40:48.307
- Here?

40:49.412 --> 40:50.586
- Yes, here! We're in the middle
of the damn channel!

40:51.276 --> 40:51.690
It's as good a place as any.

40:52.484 --> 40:52.898
- I mean, I guess you're right.

40:53.934 --> 40:54.900
But like, what're we gonna
do with the boat?

40:55.763 --> 40:56.799
We still have to get
to Cat Island

40:57.489 --> 40:59.111
and then back to the marina.

41:05.463 --> 41:08.155
Hey, do you think that drilling
rig could help us?

41:08.776 --> 41:09.915
Do you have any flares?

41:11.123 --> 41:12.331
[dramatic music] [flare hisses]

41:12.677 --> 41:13.574
Hey! Hey!

41:15.611 --> 41:17.198
Over here!

41:17.509 --> 41:18.337
Hey!

41:19.511 --> 41:20.892
Do you think they can
even see us?

41:21.479 --> 41:25.586
[tense music] [thud]

41:26.173 --> 41:26.587
- Something hit us.

41:27.554 --> 41:29.728
- The shark! It's
headed right for us!

41:30.764 --> 41:31.972
[flames crackle]

41:32.455 --> 41:32.869
- We're on fire!

41:33.939 --> 41:35.044
This is gonna explode, the gas
tank is back there!

41:35.596 --> 41:35.907
- What should we do?

41:36.770 --> 41:37.253
- Let's try to make
it to the rig.

41:38.219 --> 41:38.979
- That's suicide, the
shark will get us!

41:39.980 --> 41:42.603
- Barbecue or chum, which
one is it gonna be?

41:44.363 --> 41:45.157
[water splashes]

41:45.641 --> 41:48.057
[explosion roars]

41:48.644 --> 41:53.407

41:55.098 --> 41:59.344
[shark growls] [yelps]

41:59.655 --> 42:00.483
- Barry!

42:00.759 --> 42:01.104
No!

42:01.588 --> 42:03.969
[shark growls]

42:04.383 --> 42:04.591

[flesh crunches]

42:11.287 --> 42:14.773
[distant boat horn blows]

42:15.394 --> 42:16.879
- Devin, come over here.

42:17.362 --> 42:17.638
- What is it?

42:18.605 --> 42:20.538
- That looks like a fire
out on the water.

42:21.124 --> 42:23.023
[suspenseful music]

42:23.610 --> 42:25.025
- Yeah, it kinda does.

42:25.508 --> 42:28.062
[shark growls]

42:31.687 --> 42:32.550
Is that what I think it is?

42:33.481 --> 42:35.587
- That's one big-ass shark.
[shark snarls]

42:36.312 --> 42:37.520
And it's heading right for us.

42:38.521 --> 42:41.144
- Roy, we better alert
someone about this.

42:43.699 --> 42:48.013
- Yeah, yeah. We have a
situation on level four,
south side.

42:48.496 --> 42:51.223
[shark growls]

42:51.707 --> 42:52.328
[explosion roars]

42:53.191 --> 42:54.917
- That thing is
attacking the rig!

[shark growls]

42:57.575 --> 42:59.369
[Roy and Devin cough]
[alarm blares]

43:00.094 --> 43:00.474
- What the hell are we gonna do?

43:01.613 --> 43:04.409
- I don't know how much more
strain this rig can take!

43:05.272 --> 43:06.825
We may have to abandon her!

43:07.308 --> 43:08.655
[shark roars]

43:09.414 --> 43:10.967
[flames crackle] [alarm blares]

43:11.450 --> 43:13.521
[shark roars]

43:14.522 --> 43:16.145
I'm jumping. We'll be
killed if we don't.

43:16.732 --> 43:18.354
- I'm right behind ya.

43:20.494 --> 43:23.255
[water splashes]

43:24.878 --> 43:27.674
[explosion roars]

43:31.678 --> 43:32.402
[explosion roars]

43:32.851 --> 43:33.265
[water splashes]

43:33.852 --> 43:35.613
Swim for that island.

43:36.924 --> 43:39.099
[alarm whines]

43:40.065 --> 43:41.170
- We were watching the
shark's movements.

43:42.205 --> 43:44.587
It struck so fast, we didn't
have time to react.

43:45.484 --> 43:47.072
- This is bad. We're
in trouble now.

43:47.832 --> 43:49.834
There's no way to contain this.

43:50.558 --> 43:51.456
- We're awaiting your orders.

43:52.353 --> 43:53.285
- It's time to take
out the threat.

43:54.424 --> 43:57.462
We can't do anything about the
rig, that's my problem,

43:58.221 --> 43:59.913
but we can eradicate the shark.

44:00.534 --> 44:01.708
Gear up and move out.

44:02.191 --> 44:04.952
[dramatic music]

44:27.009 --> 44:28.389
[phone rings]

44:28.976 --> 44:30.564
Yes? [suspenseful music]

44:31.220 --> 44:33.256
I am aware of what happened.

44:35.465 --> 44:37.675
I am as disappointed as you are.

44:38.434 --> 44:40.470
Yes, I understand. [door creaks]

44:41.609 --> 44:44.612
I'll do everything in my power
to remedy the situation.

44:45.717 --> 44:46.925
[gun fires]

44:47.443 --> 44:50.101
[water swashes]

45:04.840 --> 45:06.600
- Don't worry. Help
will come soon.

45:07.912 --> 45:08.809
- How do you know that for sure?

45:09.776 --> 45:10.052
They'll be too busy
trying to pretend

45:10.984 --> 45:11.536
that shark didn't come
looking for us.

45:12.675 --> 45:14.401
- Other survivors may have made
it to the island, too.

45:15.402 --> 45:17.611
They'll do a thorough
search and find us.

45:19.578 --> 45:22.029
- Shall we start a fire on the
beach just in case?

45:23.203 --> 45:24.031
- With what?

45:25.964 --> 45:27.000
- Good point.

45:28.829 --> 45:30.935
[shark growls]

45:31.418 --> 45:33.385
[dramatic music]

45:33.800 --> 45:34.145
Watch out!

45:34.628 --> 45:37.113
[shark roars]

45:43.292 --> 45:44.500
- That was close!

45:46.640 --> 45:47.020
Thanks, buddy.

45:47.917 --> 45:48.469
- Just remember to
return the favor,

45:49.332 --> 45:51.024
in case I'm in the
same situation.

45:52.301 --> 45:53.992
- We better stay
away from shore.

45:54.475 --> 45:57.202
[brooding music]

46:02.760 --> 46:05.486
[dramatic music]

46:18.154 --> 46:18.741
- That's one bad-ass shark

46:19.707 --> 46:21.537
to be able to destroy a
structure like that.

46:22.572 --> 46:26.231
- It's an animal, and all
animals bleed and die.

46:30.166 --> 46:32.134
[sighs]

46:32.651 --> 46:33.860
Answer, Bosswell.

46:35.482 --> 46:37.380
We're at the marina, as ordered!

46:42.765 --> 46:43.110
[sighs]

46:44.008 --> 46:44.491
- [Dodds] You know my
next question.

46:45.147 --> 46:46.458
- "What's the plan?" Right?

46:46.804 --> 46:47.149
- Right.

46:48.322 --> 46:50.186
- Well, fighting it on the open
water would be suicide.

46:51.049 --> 46:53.293
The shark has an
advantage over us.

46:53.949 --> 46:55.571
See that island over there?

46:56.158 --> 46:56.814
- Yeah, what about it?

46:57.435 --> 46:58.263
- We could lure it there,

46:59.195 --> 47:01.266
to the shallow inlets
that pocket it.

47:01.888 --> 47:02.164
Then we can destroy it

47:03.061 --> 47:04.166
with those explosives I
put in your bag.

47:05.374 --> 47:06.720
- How do you know there are
shallow inlets on that island?

47:07.686 --> 47:08.998
- 'Cause I did the research
on our database.

47:10.068 --> 47:11.587
- Oh, and here I thought you
and your boyfriend

47:12.588 --> 47:14.314
went out there and screwed
around a few times.

47:14.970 --> 47:15.971
- I don't have a boyfriend.

47:16.730 --> 47:19.422
- Not surprised. [Parks scoffs]

47:39.891 --> 47:42.411
- We'll be commandeering
this vessel now.

47:43.067 --> 47:44.482
- Way to keep a low profile.

47:46.691 --> 47:49.349
[water swashes]

48:14.581 --> 48:17.584
[suspenseful music]

48:18.585 --> 48:18.896
- This island is weird.

48:19.827 --> 48:20.759
What's with all the
pockets of water?

48:21.829 --> 48:23.245
- The same company that owns the
drilling operation

48:23.970 --> 48:25.799
dredged this island years ago.

48:26.213 --> 48:27.042
- What for?

48:28.526 --> 48:29.941
- They tried to tap the oil from
the ocean from here,

48:30.493 --> 48:31.632
drilling diagonal.

48:32.254 --> 48:32.564
It wasn't too successful,

48:33.669 --> 48:35.843
so they used the more
traditional vertical approach.

48:36.534 --> 48:38.294
- They ruined it. Look at it.

48:43.161 --> 48:44.645
- That's progress.

48:46.061 --> 48:47.959
- I'm thirsty. I hope this
water's safe to drink.

48:51.721 --> 48:55.933
[suspenseful music]
[shark growls]

48:56.692 --> 49:01.628
[water splashes] [shark growls]

49:02.111 --> 49:02.387
[grunts]

49:03.147 --> 49:04.976
Thanks. I guess we're even now.

49:06.150 --> 49:08.462
- A few more feet and that thing
would've beached itself.

49:09.498 --> 49:11.155
- A few more feet and you
would've been dinner.

49:11.638 --> 49:12.121
[Devin chuckles]

49:12.742 --> 49:13.951
Speaking of dinner...

49:14.606 --> 49:16.056
- [chuckles] You're hungry?

49:16.505 --> 49:17.782
- Yeah, so?

49:18.956 --> 49:20.060
[chuckles] It's been
a trying day,

49:20.785 --> 49:22.683
and it's way past dinner time.

49:23.443 --> 49:24.168
- Look around for some berries.

49:25.031 --> 49:26.998
There's no fast food
joints here.

49:27.378 --> 49:27.757
- Gotcha.

49:28.827 --> 49:30.312
- Let's head back to shore.
We've explored enough.

49:31.416 --> 49:33.832
Maybe there's someone on their
way to rescue us.

49:34.833 --> 49:35.110
- Right.

49:36.249 --> 49:37.975
In the meantime, we can catch
some fish and cook 'em.

49:38.320 --> 49:38.699
- Yup.

49:39.700 --> 49:40.978
There was a microwave
plugged into a tree,

49:41.530 --> 49:42.703
just off the beach.

49:44.188 --> 49:45.983
- Everyone's a
smart-ass these days.

50:00.618 --> 50:03.621
[suspenseful music]

50:08.522 --> 50:11.284
[water splashes]

50:12.216 --> 50:15.150
[distant engine hums]

50:15.771 --> 50:17.773
That sounds like a boat.

50:18.912 --> 50:20.810
- See? I told you someone
would find us.

50:23.330 --> 50:24.124
- Over there.

50:29.129 --> 50:31.166
- They can't be too far ahead.
Let's catch up to them.

50:31.856 --> 50:33.202
- Hope they brought snacks.

50:45.421 --> 50:48.045
[water swashes]

50:51.945 --> 50:54.396
[eerie music]

50:57.502 --> 50:57.882
[Parks sighs]

50:58.952 --> 51:03.060
- I have a sneaking suspicion
that Bosswell was...

51:03.370 --> 51:03.888
Fired.

51:04.509 --> 51:06.028
- [sighs] Bummer, sort of.

51:10.550 --> 51:13.104
[shark growls]

51:18.247 --> 51:19.076
- What?

51:20.007 --> 51:21.975
- It's coming. Get ready.

51:22.527 --> 51:25.530
[suspenseful music]

51:31.295 --> 51:33.366
[dramatic music]

51:33.745 --> 51:34.263
- Damn!

51:34.746 --> 51:35.644
- Wait for it!

51:39.061 --> 51:44.066
[shark roars] [guns
fire rapidly]

51:44.687 --> 51:45.136
- Gunfire!

51:45.654 --> 51:48.277
[water swashes]

51:52.764 --> 51:55.319
[shark growls]

51:56.734 --> 51:58.356
- It came from this direction.

52:01.670 --> 52:03.396
- Our bullets barely
made a dent.

52:04.259 --> 52:05.501
- We'll have to find
its weak spot.

52:06.399 --> 52:08.504
- Apparently, dying is
its weak spot.

52:09.091 --> 52:10.368
- Shut up and think.

52:16.374 --> 52:16.892
The neck area and the eyes

52:17.755 --> 52:19.308
would be its most
vulnerable spot.

52:20.033 --> 52:21.241
Next time, we take aim there.

52:21.966 --> 52:22.415
- "Next time"? Are you crazy?

52:23.278 --> 52:23.968
I'm not waiting for a
"next time".

52:25.176 --> 52:28.386
It's too smart to come back for
another round. Game over.

52:29.801 --> 52:31.665
- Hey! Over here!

52:38.845 --> 52:40.053
- We're sure glad to see you.

52:41.054 --> 52:43.160
- There's a crazy monster
shark out there.

52:43.574 --> 52:44.161
- We know.

52:45.231 --> 52:47.716
And I have a feeling you're
gonna help us kill it.

52:48.855 --> 52:49.683
- Kill it?

52:50.891 --> 52:52.134
You're part of a rescue team,
right?

52:53.066 --> 52:54.723
Looking for survivors of
the rig disaster?

52:55.275 --> 52:57.691
[suspenseful music]

52:58.727 --> 53:00.936
- You still can take us out
of here, right?

53:01.799 --> 53:06.804
- Why don't we have a
little chat?

53:11.740 --> 53:13.362
- Can we talk this over?

53:14.639 --> 53:15.813
- This is inhuman!

53:16.503 --> 53:17.470
You won't get away with this.

53:18.091 --> 53:18.816
Who are you working for?

53:19.472 --> 53:20.197
- Why, Uncle Sam, of course.

53:21.128 --> 53:22.337
And yes, we will get
away with this.

53:23.269 --> 53:24.131
You and your grease
monkey friend here

53:24.994 --> 53:25.719
were killed during
the rig attack.

53:26.651 --> 53:27.997
Crushed, burned or
devoured by that shark.

53:29.102 --> 53:31.277
You let us know so we can write
home to your mommy.

53:31.967 --> 53:34.211
[chuckles] [Devin groans]

53:34.659 --> 53:37.179
[Devin pants]

53:42.184 --> 53:44.186
- Sharks just love the
scent of blood.

53:45.049 --> 53:46.775
They can smell it
from miles away.

53:47.776 --> 53:51.089
Even prehistoric ones like this,
I'm guessing.

53:52.539 --> 53:57.510
[flesh squelches] [Roy groans]

53:58.476 --> 54:02.998
[dramatic music] [shark growls]

54:12.559 --> 54:14.975
[Roy groans]

54:17.081 --> 54:18.393
- Here it comes!

54:19.463 --> 54:20.222
- Help!

54:20.533 --> 54:21.361
- No!

54:23.915 --> 54:24.606
[water splashes] [shark roars]

54:25.192 --> 54:26.332
- Damn! [gun fires]

54:27.264 --> 54:29.369
[flesh crunches] [gun
fires rapidly]

54:29.852 --> 54:30.681
[shark growls]

54:31.406 --> 54:34.098
Don't even think about it, hero!

54:35.030 --> 54:36.203
[thud]

54:36.652 --> 54:37.481
[shark growls]

54:37.964 --> 54:40.725
[water splashes]

54:42.313 --> 54:44.488
- Stop being Lone Ranger.
Come and untie me.

54:47.249 --> 54:48.319
- Keep your shirt on.

54:48.906 --> 54:51.909
[suspenseful music]

55:06.751 --> 55:09.202
[Roy groans]

55:12.688 --> 55:13.240
- That was too close.

55:14.345 --> 55:16.520
- Yeah? You didn't even get
clobbered over the head.

55:17.693 --> 55:21.041
- You didn't get served up for
shark chow. I'm bleeding!

55:22.664 --> 55:23.596
- What about her?

55:24.907 --> 55:25.943
- How many bullets do
you have left?

55:27.013 --> 55:30.016
- Don't even consider it.
We're not murderers.

55:44.651 --> 55:45.618
She's not dead.

55:48.034 --> 55:48.862
- Too bad.

55:50.174 --> 55:51.589
- But she is badly injured.

55:53.315 --> 55:54.143
- Now what?

55:55.559 --> 55:58.389
- Don't you see? She's our
ticket out of here.

55:59.839 --> 56:02.289
[waves crash]

56:38.464 --> 56:40.362
Which way is your boat?

56:44.055 --> 56:44.297
It's this way.

56:45.471 --> 56:46.955
- Her sense of direction
might've got knocked out of her,

56:47.542 --> 56:48.197
as well as her fight.

56:49.233 --> 56:51.718
- We'll find it. The island
isn't that big.

56:52.063 --> 56:52.892
Come on.

57:06.043 --> 57:08.148
[ominous music]

57:08.597 --> 57:11.220
[shark snarls]

57:14.776 --> 57:16.709
[water splashes]

57:17.364 --> 57:19.056
The fin. I just saw it.

57:19.746 --> 57:21.472
The shark, it's following us.

57:22.404 --> 57:23.647
- Great.

57:23.992 --> 57:24.302
Great.

57:25.027 --> 57:26.960
How's it know where we're going?

57:27.444 --> 57:28.272
- Hard to say.

57:29.653 --> 57:31.309
It may have greater senses
than we're aware of.

57:32.414 --> 57:34.485
- I don't like the idea of
getting back on the water.

57:35.417 --> 57:36.867
I'm not so sure we're
gonna be safe.

57:37.833 --> 57:39.732
- We don't even know if
help is on the way.

57:40.387 --> 57:42.182
Besides, we have weapons.

57:42.735 --> 57:43.908
- Ex, expl... Ex...

57:45.116 --> 57:46.083
- [Roy] What is she
trying to say?

57:46.532 --> 57:47.809
- On the boat.

57:48.257 --> 57:49.120
Explosives.

57:49.707 --> 57:50.501
- She said "explosives".

57:51.433 --> 57:52.469
- [Roy] [sighs] Are you
gonna trust her?

57:53.090 --> 57:53.746
She just tried to kill us.

57:54.643 --> 57:56.231
- They also came here to
kill the shark.

57:57.128 --> 57:59.199
So they must be packing
a real arsenal.

58:00.269 --> 58:00.891
Don't worry about her.

58:01.788 --> 58:03.963
She's in no condition to
put up a fight.

58:04.550 --> 58:05.516
- Hope you're right.

58:07.380 --> 58:12.385
[shark growls] [tense music]

58:40.724 --> 58:43.209
[waves crash]

59:27.046 --> 59:29.635
[Parks groans]

59:33.880 --> 59:35.226
- A little help here, please.

59:36.158 --> 59:38.575
- I don't like her. Let
her walk herself.

59:39.817 --> 59:41.543
- You can't carry on this way.

59:42.993 --> 59:45.202
- She didn't have you tied up
and cut with a knife.

59:46.652 --> 59:49.344
Should've seen that look in her
eyes. Evil, pure evil.

59:50.656 --> 59:53.417
[distant shrieks]

59:53.935 --> 59:54.901
What's that sound?

59:56.282 --> 59:57.524
[suspenseful music]
[distant shrieks]

59:58.111 --> 59:59.250
- Sounds like a bird.

1:00:00.458 --> 1:00:02.115
- No, no, no. That's no bird.

1:00:02.771 --> 1:00:04.324
It's coming from over there.

1:00:06.464 --> 1:00:11.469
[suspenseful music]
[distant shrieks]

1:00:31.075 --> 1:00:31.835
No way!

1:00:32.318 --> 1:00:33.906
Baby shark eggs!

1:00:34.527 --> 1:00:35.735
That thing was pregnant!

1:00:37.392 --> 1:00:38.876
- Sharks don't lay eggs.

1:00:39.808 --> 1:00:40.740
- Species does.

1:00:41.361 --> 1:00:43.191
Maybe it's part-reptile.

1:00:46.712 --> 1:00:47.471
- What are you doing?

1:00:48.541 --> 1:00:50.750
- We can't let these things
hatch. You know that.

1:00:51.371 --> 1:00:54.720
[eggs crack and squelch]

1:00:55.893 --> 1:00:57.826
[sighs]

1:00:59.690 --> 1:01:01.588
- Let's get out of here.

1:01:13.911 --> 1:01:18.882
[shark growls] [tense music]

1:01:20.193 --> 1:01:22.955
[water splashes]

1:01:28.788 --> 1:01:29.789
[shark roars]

1:01:30.272 --> 1:01:32.689
[water splashes]

1:01:33.275 --> 1:01:36.278
[suspenseful music]

1:02:10.519 --> 1:02:11.417
Explosives!

1:02:12.901 --> 1:02:15.317
These things will give that
shark indigestion real fast.

1:02:22.221 --> 1:02:24.741
You! How long have you known
about this shark?

1:02:27.709 --> 1:02:30.712
- It was freed by the original
drilling operation

1:02:31.264 --> 1:02:32.576
you were working at.

1:02:33.439 --> 1:02:34.233
Platform 27.

1:02:35.372 --> 1:02:36.442
- Why didn't you kill it when
you first discovered it?

1:02:37.788 --> 1:02:39.859
Look at all the lives you
could've saved had
you done that.

1:02:40.964 --> 1:02:44.243
- Our orders were to keep the
drilling at peak pace.

1:02:44.830 --> 1:02:46.452
Keep the shark at bay.

1:02:47.073 --> 1:02:47.591
The noise of the drilling

1:02:48.557 --> 1:02:50.767
kept the shark from
getting in the way.

1:02:51.422 --> 1:02:51.802
- Yeah, and all this time,

1:02:52.838 --> 1:02:55.012
the shark got a smorgasbord
across the beach.

1:02:56.669 --> 1:02:59.534
- Anyone outside of the
operation was
considered expendable.

1:03:00.052 --> 1:03:00.535
Collateral damage.

1:03:01.536 --> 1:03:04.366
- I should throw your
sorry ass overboard.

1:03:12.202 --> 1:03:13.859
- Done interrogating
the prisoner?

1:03:14.721 --> 1:03:15.550
- For now.

1:03:17.690 --> 1:03:20.175
[eerie music]

1:03:22.074 --> 1:03:24.662
[shark growls]

1:03:47.858 --> 1:03:48.894
- Stop the boat!

1:03:49.342 --> 1:03:49.964
[gun fires]

1:03:50.861 --> 1:03:52.276
Don't even think about it,
cowboy!

1:03:52.898 --> 1:03:55.141
I said, stop the boat!

1:04:05.876 --> 1:04:06.946
- Okay, now what?

1:04:07.913 --> 1:04:08.948
- And now we're gonna
kill the shark!

1:04:10.053 --> 1:04:12.400
It has to be eradicated so the
drilling can continue!

1:04:13.332 --> 1:04:16.059
- Uh, newsflash: the
rig is destroyed.

1:04:16.611 --> 1:04:17.336
- A minor setback.

1:04:18.302 --> 1:04:19.890
No one's gonna give up on
the oil pocket

1:04:20.960 --> 1:04:24.584
when it generates billions of
dollars in revenue.

1:04:25.102 --> 1:04:25.551
- Greedy bastards.

1:04:26.414 --> 1:04:28.071
- Shut up and do what
you're told.

1:04:29.175 --> 1:04:30.832
- You haven't told us anything.
Only threatened us.

1:04:31.833 --> 1:04:35.319
- Okay, okay. We're gonna
lure the shark here.

1:04:36.044 --> 1:04:38.150
The explosives will do the rest.

1:04:40.152 --> 1:04:41.774
- Look, you're not
gonna cut me again.

1:04:42.948 --> 1:04:46.192
- I'm the one with the gun, I'm
the one calling the shots!

1:04:46.675 --> 1:04:47.021
[shark roars]

1:04:47.504 --> 1:04:51.094
[thud] [groans]

1:04:51.715 --> 1:04:53.130
[gun fires] - I'm hit!

1:04:53.751 --> 1:04:54.131
- [Devin] That's enough!

1:04:54.856 --> 1:04:56.651
[grunting] [dramatic music]

1:04:57.824 --> 1:05:00.862
- Come on, tough guy! I eat boys
like you for breakfast!

1:05:01.311 --> 1:05:02.036
[shark snarls]

1:05:02.519 --> 1:05:04.901
[thud] [yelps]

1:05:05.729 --> 1:05:07.351
All right, enough of
the heroics!

1:05:08.042 --> 1:05:10.354
Now we're gonna do it my way!

1:05:12.529 --> 1:05:13.702
You're gonna bleed all right!

1:05:14.358 --> 1:05:19.260
[water splashes] [screams]

1:05:22.056 --> 1:05:23.920
- I can't say I'm too
disappointed.

1:05:24.644 --> 1:05:26.232
- Let's get the hell outta here.

1:05:29.926 --> 1:05:30.443
[boat engine stalls]

1:05:31.341 --> 1:05:32.169
What the hell are you
trying to do?

1:05:32.825 --> 1:05:34.206
- I think it's flooded!

1:05:34.723 --> 1:05:37.588
[water swashes]

1:05:38.106 --> 1:05:39.625
- We have company!

1:05:48.945 --> 1:05:50.222
- All we need is a clean shot.

1:05:51.223 --> 1:05:52.638
Those explosives it
swallowed will set it off

1:05:53.225 --> 1:05:54.502
like the Fourth of July.

1:05:54.985 --> 1:05:57.712
[dramatic music]

1:06:05.099 --> 1:06:08.378
We only have a few shots left.
Let's make them count.

1:06:10.794 --> 1:06:11.588
- Hold it steady.

1:06:12.485 --> 1:06:14.660
- I'm trying. I'm
shaking too hard.

1:06:19.941 --> 1:06:21.011
- This is it!

1:06:25.050 --> 1:06:25.429
- You're extinct!

1:06:26.154 --> 1:06:26.534
[water splashes] [shark roars]

1:06:27.397 --> 1:06:32.402
[explosion roars]
[shark shrieks]

1:06:36.820 --> 1:06:40.065
[peaceful piano music]

1:06:44.448 --> 1:06:49.419
[engine hums] [water swashes]

1:07:00.464 --> 1:07:01.120
[dramatic news jingle]

1:07:01.569 --> 1:07:01.879
- The ocean.

1:07:03.088 --> 1:07:06.781
Behind me, it looks inviting,
serene and safe, but is it?

1:07:07.506 --> 1:07:08.093
We have received several reports

1:07:08.990 --> 1:07:09.749
of a shark prowling
these shores,

1:07:10.992 --> 1:07:12.890
and while this isn't uncommon,
these reports claim the shark

1:07:14.099 --> 1:07:17.757
is in fact monstrous, ranging
from 50 to 60 feet in length,

1:07:18.620 --> 1:07:19.828
larger than any known
Great White.

1:07:21.002 --> 1:07:22.038
Does the sudden appearance have
anything to do with the

1:07:23.280 --> 1:07:25.938
increased drilling at the newly
renovated rig just offshore?

1:07:27.008 --> 1:07:29.114
The EPA is still trying to
get accurate reports

1:07:30.011 --> 1:07:30.805
on just how far they
are drilling,

1:07:31.909 --> 1:07:33.463
and at what cost to the
environment this will have.

1:07:34.602 --> 1:07:36.362
Is the rig hiding a secret and
is there any connection

1:07:37.570 --> 1:07:41.126
to the mysterious monster
supposedly prowling the depths?

1:07:42.230 --> 1:07:44.715
[waves crash]

1:07:56.382 --> 1:07:58.936
[shark growls]

1:08:03.148 --> 1:08:05.702
[upbeat music]
