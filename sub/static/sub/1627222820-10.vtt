00:01.210 --> 00:02.878
My last relationship lasted six years.

00:02.878 --> 00:05.172
Emma, that's my ex, she moved in,

00:05.172 --> 00:08.926
and she brought with her
her 7‐year‐old daughter, Lucy.

00:08.926 --> 00:11.929
Emma thought a hard break
would be best for Lucy.

00:11.929 --> 00:14.264
Really haven't spoken to her since.

00:14.264 --> 00:17.684
‐ All in favor of evicting all three
members of Murder, She Wrote?

00:18.936 --> 00:21.355
Terrific!
My girlfriend's been stabbed.

00:21.355 --> 00:22.981
I'm losing my home now?

00:22.981 --> 00:25.108
‐ I have a big solo tomorrow night.

00:25.108 --> 00:27.027
‐ Would it be okay if I came
to see you tomorrow?

00:27.027 --> 00:29.655
I mean, after all,
I'm dating the first chair bassoonist,

00:29.655 --> 00:32.699
and I've never even seen you play.
I think it would make me too nervous.

00:32.699 --> 00:35.536
The youngest first chair bassoonist

00:35.536 --> 00:38.789
in our symphony's history.
Ms. Allison Tipton.

00:38.789 --> 00:42.084
‐ Tox report's back.
Tim Kono was poisoned!

00:42.084 --> 00:44.962
He was already dead when he was shot.
‐ This was a crime of passion.

00:44.962 --> 00:47.381
Romantic fury,
the desire to see someone suffer

00:47.381 --> 00:49.132
before you blow their brains out!

00:49.132 --> 00:51.093
‐ We certainly heard a late night visitor.

00:51.093 --> 00:52.427
‐ Tim was seeing someone?

00:52.427 --> 00:54.513
‐ I never heard a woman scream like that.

00:54.513 --> 00:57.349
You think his sex toys
could reveal anything?

00:57.349 --> 00:58.892
‐ I don't know. What is this?

00:58.892 --> 01:00.686
Exotic Instruments...

01:00.686 --> 01:03.689
‐ Why is there a bassoon cleaner
in Tim's sex toy box?

01:16.702 --> 01:18.328
Twenty‐three seconds.

01:19.371 --> 01:22.749
That's the time I spent
when I was actually alive

01:22.749 --> 01:25.127
with three people on an elevator.

01:26.712 --> 01:29.840
And it's lead to all this.

01:29.840 --> 01:31.842
Just 23 seconds.

01:32.885 --> 01:34.553
My name is Tim Kono.

01:34.553 --> 01:38.015
I lived in apartment 9A
here at the Arconia.

01:38.015 --> 01:40.142
Approximately 12 minutes from now,

01:40.142 --> 01:42.352
I will be murdered.

01:42.352 --> 01:44.563
But, let's not rush this.

01:44.563 --> 01:47.566
Get to know a fellow a little before
he tells you how he died, right?

01:54.198 --> 01:55.949
I was never very good with people.

01:56.909 --> 01:58.869
Never really felt lonely though.

01:58.869 --> 02:00.829
That came later.

02:00.829 --> 02:02.331
After Mabel...

02:02.331 --> 02:05.250
and Oscar and Zoe.

02:06.084 --> 02:08.795
The loneliness came
after I lost all of that.

02:11.131 --> 02:14.134
So, when someone
comes along and reminds you

02:14.134 --> 02:16.303
that we all deal with the same shit...

02:17.304 --> 02:19.306
...sometimes, you welcome them in,

02:20.390 --> 02:21.725
with inhibitions lowered,

02:21.725 --> 02:24.228
with arms wide open.

02:28.232 --> 02:29.274
No fucking way!

02:29.942 --> 02:31.610
We have to tell Charles!

02:31.610 --> 02:34.404
He's gonna hate us!
‐ He already hates us.

02:34.404 --> 02:35.864
Mabel!
‐ What?

02:35.864 --> 02:39.076
‐ What a terrific goddamn
finale this is gonna be.

02:39.076 --> 02:42.663
‐ Oliver, he could be in danger.
‐ Right, right. For sure.

02:42.663 --> 02:44.915
But that might not be so bad either.

02:50.087 --> 02:52.089
‐ Charles!
‐ Charles!

02:52.923 --> 02:54.842
Okay, we‐we gotta break the door down.

02:54.842 --> 02:58.262
‐ Excuse me? We weigh 125 combined.

02:58.262 --> 03:00.764
‐ Oh, thank you. It's the dips. Come on.

03:02.015 --> 03:05.018
Okay. One... two...

03:05.018 --> 03:06.520
Go, Mabel, go!

03:10.315 --> 03:11.275
Ow!

03:14.987 --> 03:17.573
Oh my god, she's gotten to you already.

03:17.573 --> 03:18.740
‐ What's going on?

03:18.740 --> 03:20.617
‐ So, funny story...

03:20.617 --> 03:22.786
‐ You're sleeping with a murderer!

04:14.338 --> 04:16.757
‐ You two could not look
more crazy right now.

04:16.757 --> 04:18.300
‐ For the record,

04:18.300 --> 04:20.594
it's not fun for me
to tell you any of this.

04:20.594 --> 04:22.471
‐ Nor I. Nor does it give me pleasure

04:22.471 --> 04:24.139
to remind you that you're being recorded.

04:25.057 --> 04:27.434
He is dating the potential killer, Mabel!

04:27.434 --> 04:29.895
The rules are changing by the minute!

04:29.895 --> 04:32.439
‐ Jan lives on the sixth floor.

04:32.439 --> 04:34.775
Tim was carrying someone else's trash bag

04:34.775 --> 04:37.653
full of suicide notes and cocktail glasses

04:37.653 --> 04:40.405
from the sixth floor. So,

04:40.405 --> 04:43.450
I know this isn't easy to hear, but...

04:43.450 --> 04:45.619
we found out that Tim was having

04:45.619 --> 04:47.329
some sort of romantic thing with‐‐

04:47.329 --> 04:49.206
‐ Jan was fucking Tim Kono! I'm sorry,

04:49.206 --> 04:51.500
we're recordings.
You know, we gotta pace it up.

04:51.500 --> 04:53.502
‐ That's ridiculous.
I know,

04:53.502 --> 04:55.671
but before you look too
shocked by their age difference,

04:55.671 --> 04:57.005
maybe you wanna look at the two of you.

04:57.005 --> 05:00.133
‐ I am not going down
one of your idiotic rabbit holes.

05:00.133 --> 05:03.303
I searched all of Tim's cellphone.
Jan wasn't anywhere on it.

05:03.303 --> 05:06.515
‐ Well, maybe he deleted her,
or she deleted herself.

05:06.515 --> 05:10.143
‐ Are you forgetting someone stabbed her?
Oh, right.

05:10.143 --> 05:13.522
I forgot the real killer decided
not to kill Jan. By the way,

05:13.522 --> 05:16.108
I've had worse injuries shucking oysters!

05:16.108 --> 05:17.568
‐ You have to leave.

05:17.568 --> 05:20.696
I can't hear any more of your insanity.

05:20.696 --> 05:23.448
This is the first romantic
relationship I've had in years!

05:23.448 --> 05:26.076
Why are you trying to ruin it for me?
We're not,

05:26.076 --> 05:27.578
but, Charles...

05:27.578 --> 05:29.413
Where is Jan right now?

05:29.997 --> 05:32.916
‐ She's a... she's a‐a‐at the symphony,

05:32.916 --> 05:34.960
still playing. I left early.

05:34.960 --> 05:36.712
‐ And why'd you do that?

05:37.963 --> 05:39.423
‐ Why are you still here?

05:40.048 --> 05:42.676
‐ Just please...

05:42.676 --> 05:44.178
look at what's in front of you,

05:44.178 --> 05:46.138
and be careful.

05:47.764 --> 05:49.766
‐ Jesus...

05:50.767 --> 05:53.145
So, Jan is still at the symphony.

05:53.145 --> 05:55.147
‐ Mm‐hmm.

05:57.649 --> 06:00.569
‐ Which means, she's not currently...

06:00.569 --> 06:02.070
‐ Mm‐hmm.

06:24.218 --> 06:26.220
Charles?

06:28.972 --> 06:31.099
I raced here right at intermission.

06:31.099 --> 06:34.645
They won't notice I'm gone.
Which is, well,

06:34.645 --> 06:37.981
pretty devastating to say
out loud, honestly.

06:37.981 --> 06:40.776
Anyway, I'm mortified.

06:40.776 --> 06:44.071
I don't know why I lied to you
about being first chair.

06:45.948 --> 06:48.951
I think it has to do with
being beaten out by a child.

06:50.244 --> 06:53.956
Maybe this is why all the adult doctors
were always so mean to Doogie Howser.

06:54.915 --> 06:57.376
‐ I lost a Golden Globe to him once.

06:57.376 --> 06:59.294
‐ I'm sorry.

06:59.294 --> 07:01.380
About that Globe.

07:01.380 --> 07:02.673
And this.

07:03.757 --> 07:05.676
I should've told you.

07:05.676 --> 07:08.554
Then I could've invited you, which is what
I wanted to do in the first place,

07:08.554 --> 07:10.055
until I got weird.

07:11.223 --> 07:12.808
Charles, your nose.

07:14.434 --> 07:16.603
‐ It's from earlier.
Are you sure?

07:16.603 --> 07:18.438
That looks fresh.

07:18.438 --> 07:20.440
Can I get you some ice?

07:21.108 --> 07:22.609
Maybe we can have a drink?

07:23.485 --> 07:26.905
Maybe we can have 12 drinks?

07:28.824 --> 07:30.325
‐ Come on in.

07:30.325 --> 07:33.829
‐ You almost let me break
my scapula earlier, and you could do this?

07:33.829 --> 07:35.414
‐ Charles taught me.

07:35.414 --> 07:38.584
I taught him how to use Postmates,
and he taught me how to do this.

07:38.584 --> 07:40.544
‐ Aw. You two, I swear.

07:40.544 --> 07:43.547
It's like watching Paper Moon
for the first time all over again.

07:45.591 --> 07:48.594
‐ When I saw you in
the audience, I felt terrified.

07:51.054 --> 07:52.306
Here.

07:52.973 --> 07:55.017
‐ Oh, that's nice. Thank you.

07:55.017 --> 07:58.729
‐ And I thought, "That's it. He's just
always gonna think the worst of me now."

07:59.354 --> 08:00.397
‐ That could never happen.

08:01.481 --> 08:03.150
‐ Can we toast to that?

08:12.034 --> 08:14.036
Oh. Did I leave that here?

08:14.953 --> 08:17.372
‐ Uh, we found that in
Tim Kono's apartment.

08:18.582 --> 08:21.585
‐ It's a bassoon cleaner.
Why would Tim have that?

08:22.836 --> 08:24.379
‐ No idea.

08:24.379 --> 08:28.008
‐ Hold on. The murdered guy
also played bassoon?

08:28.008 --> 08:30.010
I mean, what are the odds of that?

08:31.803 --> 08:34.806
Do you think the killer
is targeting bassoonists?

08:38.977 --> 08:39.978
Wait...

08:41.021 --> 08:42.898
You're not thinking that I‐‐

08:42.898 --> 08:45.108
‐ No.

08:45.108 --> 08:46.276
Oliver and Mabel are.

08:47.945 --> 08:49.613
But not me.

08:49.613 --> 08:52.658
‐ I would, too.

08:53.242 --> 08:54.743
Jeez.

08:56.370 --> 08:58.372
So, do you think Tim Kono‐‐

08:58.372 --> 09:00.958
‐ Can we not talk about
Tim Kono right now?

09:02.543 --> 09:03.961
‐ Of course.

09:04.711 --> 09:06.213
What do you wanna talk about?

09:12.594 --> 09:15.138
‐ That I think I'm falling
in love with you.

09:16.431 --> 09:17.683
‐ Oh.

09:19.017 --> 09:20.769
Well, that's interesting.

09:26.650 --> 09:29.444
Because I think I'm falling
in love with you, too.

09:29.444 --> 09:31.071
‐ Well...

09:31.822 --> 09:33.866
that is a relief.

09:33.866 --> 09:35.450
‐ Yeah.

09:35.450 --> 09:37.870
It's usually less awkward when
it happens to both people.

09:39.913 --> 09:41.164
‐ Hm.

09:41.164 --> 09:44.084
Doesn't exactly scream killer, does it?
Where do we start?

09:44.084 --> 09:47.296
‐ Did you ever listen to that
podcast Baker's Dozen?

09:47.296 --> 09:48.589
‐ Oh, classic.

09:48.589 --> 09:50.507
Midwestern bake‐off winner

09:50.507 --> 09:52.634
dismembers 12 ladies
trying to take her title.

09:53.010 --> 09:55.554
‐ Kinda picture her place like this.
‐ Yeah.

09:55.554 --> 09:58.182
‐ Do you remember where they found
all the evidence she was hiding?

10:01.643 --> 10:03.145
‐ But let me use it first. I need to go.

10:04.855 --> 10:07.065
‐ You know what's crazy?

10:07.065 --> 10:08.859
I think I would love you

10:08.859 --> 10:10.485
even if you did kill Tim Kono.

10:11.403 --> 10:14.114
Which is super crazy because
I've broken up with people

10:14.114 --> 10:16.158
for whispering loudly in movies.

10:16.158 --> 10:19.244
Or chewing weird.

10:19.244 --> 10:20.746
‐ Wow, Charles.

10:21.622 --> 10:24.625
That's real love. Yeah.
‐ I know, right?

10:27.085 --> 10:28.378
‐ You're not drinking much.

10:33.091 --> 10:35.052
‐ Oh, I'm not drinking at all.

10:36.678 --> 10:39.014
I'm taking...

10:39.014 --> 10:40.766
stage sips.

10:41.975 --> 10:43.894
Because there's poison in it.

10:48.690 --> 10:50.484
It's what you did with Tim Kono, right?

10:51.276 --> 10:54.196
A breakup drink before you
shot him with his own gun?

10:54.655 --> 10:58.242
I'm still not sure why you
poisoned the cat though.

11:00.786 --> 11:02.037
‐ I didn't do that.

11:03.372 --> 11:05.874
All I can think is

11:05.874 --> 11:08.210
she came in the window afterwards,

11:08.210 --> 11:10.212
and maybe...

11:14.550 --> 11:16.301
I know, right?

11:16.301 --> 11:18.262
Ugh!

11:18.262 --> 11:21.473
Oh god! This is so hot, Charles.

11:22.099 --> 11:24.309
Just super exciting to be

11:24.309 --> 11:25.602
totally open together,

11:25.602 --> 11:28.480
and just let it all hang out...

11:29.481 --> 11:30.399
Woof!

11:31.900 --> 11:33.402
‐ Hey, come here.

11:36.488 --> 11:37.990
She's a poisoner...

11:45.747 --> 11:47.416
...who uses a label maker?

11:49.334 --> 11:51.336
‐ The saddest thing about this

11:51.336 --> 11:54.131
is that if Jan weren't a murderous maniac

11:54.131 --> 11:57.134
she'd be perfect for Charles.

12:01.388 --> 12:02.848
‐ So you were seeing Tim Kono?

12:04.016 --> 12:06.310
‐ Hello. I'm a sucker

12:06.310 --> 12:09.146
for lonely guys with
notable age differences

12:09.146 --> 12:11.565
I meet on elevators.
I think you know that.

12:11.565 --> 12:13.859
‐ And Tim came to see you the day he died.

12:13.859 --> 12:16.653
‐ He did. Which was also

12:16.653 --> 12:18.614
two days after he broke up with me.

12:18.614 --> 12:20.699
Not insignificant.

12:21.241 --> 12:24.828
I told him I had to give him
some things he left at my place.

12:24.828 --> 12:27.414
‐ I don't remember leaving anything here.

12:27.414 --> 12:29.541
‐ I just poured two Old Fashioneds.

12:30.709 --> 12:32.127
One more for old time's sake?

12:34.046 --> 12:36.089
And then a half‐hour later,

12:36.089 --> 12:37.966
I dumped the glasses in his bag...

12:37.966 --> 12:40.469
and just sent him on his way.

12:46.934 --> 12:50.229
And then I went back to my window
to practice my Pavane piece.

12:52.022 --> 12:53.774
‐ No. You didn't.

12:54.191 --> 12:55.817
I heard the bassoon that night.

12:55.817 --> 12:57.736
It sounded... different.

12:58.362 --> 13:00.989
You weren't playing live.
It was a recording.

13:01.365 --> 13:05.077
‐ Yay! Oh, Charles!

13:05.077 --> 13:07.538
Do you see how good
we are together?

13:08.080 --> 13:09.915
And how great

13:09.915 --> 13:13.085
is an alibi where the whole building
can hear you playing?

13:13.919 --> 13:15.879
Oh, what else did you figure out about me?

13:15.879 --> 13:17.548
Tell me, tell me, tell me.

13:17.548 --> 13:20.801
When did you really
start locking in on me?

13:25.681 --> 13:27.182
The notes.

13:33.105 --> 13:34.147
The J's...

13:35.065 --> 13:37.359
are similar.

13:37.359 --> 13:38.610
‐ Aw...

13:38.610 --> 13:41.113
My cute little J's gave me away.

13:42.072 --> 13:43.282
Good eye, kid.

13:43.282 --> 13:46.285
I compared them side by side...

13:50.664 --> 13:51.957
Oh.

13:52.541 --> 13:54.042
There it goes.

13:54.960 --> 13:56.753
That's exactly how Tim sounded.

13:59.548 --> 14:01.633
‐ The handkerchief...

14:01.633 --> 14:03.427
‐ Yay. Handkerchief,

14:03.427 --> 14:06.180
not the glasses.

14:06.180 --> 14:08.140
I mixed it up this time.

14:08.140 --> 14:10.851
You know, I'm not one of those
who always does it the same

14:10.851 --> 14:13.228
and has to carve a niche for themselves.

14:13.228 --> 14:16.773
Even though I did carve a niche in myself.

14:22.821 --> 14:24.823
‐ Wait, did she...

14:26.491 --> 14:28.493
‐ You stabbed yourself?

14:32.831 --> 14:34.082
‐ Wow...

14:37.628 --> 14:39.963
That's really kicked in, hasn't it?

14:39.963 --> 14:42.257
Your legs gone?

14:42.257 --> 14:44.468
‐ Oh, tongue, too.

14:45.928 --> 14:48.055
Seen it before.

15:00.275 --> 15:01.902
You know?

15:01.902 --> 15:04.404
You and Tim are a lot alike.

15:05.656 --> 15:09.910
I felt so lucky to be let into
your private, isolated worlds.

15:11.995 --> 15:14.498
But Tim messed up
by seeing somebody else,

15:14.498 --> 15:16.667
or that's what I thought.

15:16.667 --> 15:18.335
This is the kicker. The day before,

15:18.335 --> 15:21.171
the day before we broke up,

15:21.171 --> 15:23.882
I found this emerald ring at his place.

15:23.882 --> 15:27.094
Just delivered. I mean,
clearly meant for somebody else, right?

15:28.971 --> 15:32.724
You know how I feel
about being made second.

15:32.724 --> 15:34.768
That's a big trigger for me.

15:39.231 --> 15:41.316
It's so odd.

15:44.194 --> 15:45.529
When a person begs you

15:45.529 --> 15:48.198
for their life, it is such a tonic for me.

15:53.370 --> 15:57.124
And knowing, finally,
I am truly number one for someone.

16:01.545 --> 16:04.548
You need me now more than ever, don't you?

16:05.632 --> 16:07.759
Charles, why does that feel so good?

16:08.427 --> 16:10.470
How crazy is it

16:10.470 --> 16:14.349
that ring was actually the ring

16:14.349 --> 16:16.310
from the murder you solved.

16:18.228 --> 16:19.646
Ironic.

16:19.646 --> 16:22.274
And tragic. My bad. I do own that.

16:28.488 --> 16:30.490
‐ Oliver...

16:37.289 --> 16:38.707
‐ Oh god.

16:39.249 --> 16:40.751
Oh, Mabel, I...

16:41.835 --> 16:43.545
I'm so, so sorry.

16:43.545 --> 16:45.047
‐ She did it.

16:46.298 --> 16:48.634
She really killed him.

16:49.968 --> 16:51.845
‐ Yeah, she did. She did.

16:52.763 --> 16:53.847
‐ Charles!

16:56.475 --> 16:58.810
‐ The trick now, it's not just you.

16:58.810 --> 17:01.104
There are two others I have
to deal with and more.

17:01.104 --> 17:02.856
I mean, so many know about this

17:02.856 --> 17:04.942
because of your podcast.

17:04.942 --> 17:06.944
I've gotta think big here.

17:08.529 --> 17:12.199
Isn't it nice they opened
all these fireplaces back up?

17:12.199 --> 17:15.410
I mean, in a way, it makes us
all connected in the building.

17:16.203 --> 17:18.997
Should make for a fun finale.

17:18.997 --> 17:22.292
Too bad I'm gonna miss it.
It's gonna be a gas.

17:25.337 --> 17:27.130
I want you to know

17:27.130 --> 17:29.216
this is definitely

17:29.216 --> 17:31.468
one of my rougher breakups, Charles.

17:32.970 --> 17:34.513
I really did fall in love with you.

17:38.392 --> 17:40.018
Sadly,

17:40.018 --> 17:43.021
I will not be seeing you
bassooner or later.

18:10.465 --> 18:11.717
Oh...

18:24.771 --> 18:27.274
Mm...

18:33.530 --> 18:36.116
Siri...

18:36.116 --> 18:38.285
I don't feel good...

18:38.285 --> 18:40.829
Okay. Playing Fields of Gold by Sting.

18:40.829 --> 18:43.332
‐ Oh...

19:40.639 --> 19:41.974
‐ Why is his door open?

19:41.974 --> 19:44.184
Charles!
‐ Charles!

19:48.272 --> 19:50.732
‐ Look. Where is he?

19:52.484 --> 19:55.070
‐ You overpay for your arugula

19:55.070 --> 19:57.489
every time, Uma.

19:57.489 --> 20:00.450
‐ You're one to talk,
Miss Fresh Basil in February.

20:00.450 --> 20:01.994
‐ Why'd you press all the buttons?

20:01.994 --> 20:04.204
‐ Oh, this asshole did it.

20:04.204 --> 20:06.623
You kick him out of the building,
he goes on a bender.

20:06.623 --> 20:10.043
‐ Oh god. I can't wait till he's gone.

20:12.629 --> 20:15.174
- Ah!
- Oh my god!

20:15.174 --> 20:16.383
‐ I know, right? I just got her,

20:16.383 --> 20:18.051
and I love her so much.
‐ Meow...

20:18.051 --> 20:19.595
‐ What's her name, Howard?

20:19.595 --> 20:22.222
‐ Evelyn Seven. Lucky number Sevelyn.

20:22.222 --> 20:24.224
I feel like Evelyn's death wasn't in vain.

20:24.224 --> 20:26.685
Like, she really brought
everybody together, you know?

20:26.685 --> 20:28.437
- Ah...
- Shut it!

20:28.937 --> 20:30.731
If you guys would
like to come over some time

20:30.731 --> 20:32.524
and play Parcheesi and have a gab,

20:32.524 --> 20:34.526
Sevelyn and I would love to have you over.

20:35.819 --> 20:37.112
‐ Oh, is there room?

20:37.112 --> 20:39.615
Oh sure. Yeah, come on in. We can squeeze.

20:39.615 --> 20:41.074
Hi.

20:41.533 --> 20:42.576
Do you need help?

20:44.578 --> 20:46.413
‐ You can schedule
an out‐patient with my girl.

20:46.413 --> 20:48.916
And I now take cryptocurrency.

20:52.377 --> 20:54.588
‐ There's a mess in there.

20:58.509 --> 21:01.386
‐ Don't worry. This happened to Sting
when The Police broke up.

21:01.386 --> 21:03.180
Never said a word.
Augh...

21:04.223 --> 21:07.601
‐ I'm sending you back to your apartment.
Get into bed and sleep it off.

21:07.601 --> 21:10.020
Don't tell anyone I told you about Sting.

21:12.648 --> 21:14.650
Nah...

21:17.903 --> 21:21.573
‐ Lester, have you seen Charles?
‐ Just sent him upstairs, flat on his can,

21:21.573 --> 21:24.117
struck down with the Irish Flu.
Didn't hear it from me.

21:24.117 --> 21:27.037
Same thing happened to Sting.
Don't tell anyone I told you.

21:33.585 --> 21:35.629
‐ How the hell does he...

21:40.217 --> 21:41.844
‐ Oh my god, Charles!

21:41.844 --> 21:44.263
‐ Wow, Lester was right!
‐ Grab him.

21:44.263 --> 21:46.181
‐ Okay, where did you get a Quaalude?

21:47.558 --> 21:49.643
‐ Turn him over!

21:49.643 --> 21:51.478
Hey! Hey!

21:51.478 --> 21:53.981
Did Jan poison you?
‐ Yes! She poisoned me...

21:53.981 --> 21:55.899
‐ We have to get him to a hospital.

21:55.899 --> 21:58.777
‐ Or! We get as much milk
into him as possible.

21:58.777 --> 22:00.320
It absorbs toxins.

22:01.572 --> 22:03.448
‐ Ah!

22:03.448 --> 22:05.284
‐ And if that doesn't work,
I can urinate on him.

22:05.284 --> 22:06.952
‐ I think that's for jellyfish.

22:07.536 --> 22:10.330
Wait, what is he doing?
‐ Oh no, it's his phone!

22:10.330 --> 22:13.709
Is there something on your phone, buddy?
‐ What's your password?

22:15.169 --> 22:17.588
‐ Okay, put his face on it.
‐ Okay. Hold it.

22:19.256 --> 22:21.508
‐ It's not working!
‐ His facial muscles are too limp.

22:21.508 --> 22:23.135
It's okay. I know what to do. Look.

22:24.511 --> 22:26.972
‐ We're in!
‐ Ah! God, I'm clever. Okay.

22:27.556 --> 22:29.474
JAN
Should make for a fun finale.

22:30.517 --> 22:32.895
‐ It's Jan. Did you record Jan?

22:32.895 --> 22:35.772
Too bad I'm gonna miss it.

22:35.772 --> 22:38.317
It's gonna be a gas.
Oh, hey.

22:38.317 --> 22:40.068
Is anyone feeling dizzy?

22:40.068 --> 22:42.613
I was just about to start a fire,
but it's like there's

22:42.613 --> 22:44.573
fumes coming up from the basement.

22:44.573 --> 22:45.908
‐ Oh, my daughter's in there.

22:46.867 --> 22:48.702
‐ Gas.

22:48.702 --> 22:50.370
‐ Wait, did Jan...
‐ Woof!

22:50.370 --> 22:52.998
‐ We have to go to the basement!
‐ Ah...

22:52.998 --> 22:55.334
‐ How are we gonna get him anywhere?

22:56.210 --> 22:58.670
So poetic. Closed for years

22:58.670 --> 23:00.839
because of an asthmatic Tim Kono,

23:00.839 --> 23:03.592
our fireplaces were opened again
because of his murder,

23:03.592 --> 23:05.761
only to lead to the death of thousands!

23:05.761 --> 23:07.763
‐ I don't think thousands live here.

23:07.763 --> 23:10.390
‐ Boy, you really don't
take the ride, do you?

23:13.477 --> 23:15.896
The boiler room of the Arconia.

23:15.896 --> 23:17.731
The irritable bowel of the building.

23:17.731 --> 23:19.816
A perfect spot for a perfect ending.

23:21.985 --> 23:25.531
‐ Okay. I'll take the west side of
the building, you take the east.

23:25.531 --> 23:27.032
‐ Okay.

23:28.158 --> 23:31.453
Oh my god! Look what she's done!

23:31.453 --> 23:34.456
‐ What!?
The thing!

23:34.456 --> 23:37.793
‐ The duct! That wasn't
attached to the thing!

23:37.793 --> 23:40.671
That shouldn't be that way!
Do you see a duct attached

23:40.671 --> 23:42.089
to a thing it shouldn't be attached to?

23:42.089 --> 23:44.633
‐ What are you even saying?!

23:44.633 --> 23:45.884
‐ I'm pulling the thing out here...

23:48.679 --> 23:51.974
Okay, pull down the top of your thing!

23:54.768 --> 23:56.520
Ah!

23:57.271 --> 23:58.522
We did it! I think.

23:58.522 --> 24:01.358
We‐we took down the thing,
so that the stuff won't go

24:01.358 --> 24:03.443
from the thing up into the...
Yeah, we did it!

24:03.443 --> 24:05.487
‐ Oh, you really did it.

24:07.281 --> 24:09.199
Get down here.

24:12.536 --> 24:14.079
Hey.

24:14.079 --> 24:16.081
Look at you still kicking.

24:16.748 --> 24:18.041
I was worried that hanky

24:18.041 --> 24:21.211
wouldn't do the full trick on Brazzos.

24:22.504 --> 24:25.507
Okay. Indulge me.
I've always wanted to do this.

24:28.010 --> 24:29.386
Roses are red...

24:30.971 --> 24:33.015
violets are blue...

24:33.015 --> 24:35.017
who shall I kill?

24:35.017 --> 24:36.268
Maybe it's you.

24:36.768 --> 24:37.811
CHARLES
No.

24:43.984 --> 24:44.985
No.

24:46.028 --> 24:48.405
This ends now, Jan.

24:48.405 --> 24:50.782
You won't shoot my friends.

24:50.782 --> 24:53.160
Shoot me if you need to, but not them.

24:54.203 --> 24:56.997
Because I don't want to live
in a world without them anymore.

24:57.915 --> 25:00.125
There were parts of myself that were dead

25:00.876 --> 25:02.878
that they brought back to life.

25:04.087 --> 25:05.589
Before this...

25:06.423 --> 25:09.676
I was just a hollow shell walking around.

25:10.886 --> 25:12.888
And they made me alive.

25:26.109 --> 25:28.278
‐ You're helping me get over you.

25:28.278 --> 25:29.780
‐ No!

25:33.784 --> 25:35.869
‐ This is for Tim.

25:48.841 --> 25:52.344
‐ This sends the investigation
into a whole new direction.

25:53.470 --> 25:55.597
‐ Good one, Brazzos.

25:55.597 --> 25:57.432
Now, let's go get your stomach pumped.

25:59.977 --> 26:01.436
‐ Eh...

26:15.659 --> 26:16.994
Is he gonna be okay?

26:16.994 --> 26:18.579
Three, two, one.

26:18.579 --> 26:20.163
‐ He's gonna be fine.

26:22.583 --> 26:24.126
‐ Oliver.

26:25.919 --> 26:29.506
It seems due to the events
of tonight, there's been

26:29.506 --> 26:33.051
a reversal in sentiment
regarding your tenancies

26:33.051 --> 26:35.220
here at the Arconia.

26:35.220 --> 26:37.598
‐ Oh, please, just say it, Bunny.

26:37.598 --> 26:40.934
"Welcome back, you sexy thing!"

26:40.934 --> 26:42.936
‐ I'll get you gone sooner or later.

26:44.354 --> 26:47.524
You're all idiots!
‐ Hey, Bunny.

26:47.524 --> 26:49.776
Congrats.
You're the most hated person

26:49.776 --> 26:52.237
in the building now, you cranky old bitch.

27:01.163 --> 27:03.415
Dad? Your child's home.

27:03.415 --> 27:05.292
Willie!

27:05.292 --> 27:08.754
And Winnie! My little girl!
I'm so glad you're back.

27:08.754 --> 27:11.673
Hello. Hello, Winnie!

27:11.673 --> 27:13.175
‐ Jesus, what a ride you've been on, huh?

27:13.175 --> 27:14.259
‐ You think?

27:14.843 --> 27:16.011
‐ I'm proud of you.

27:17.304 --> 27:19.306
I think. Um, I'm not even really clear

27:19.306 --> 27:21.808
what happened here,
but I wanted to stop by

27:21.808 --> 27:23.852
and give you this.

27:23.852 --> 27:25.938
It's a check for your next big thing.

27:25.938 --> 27:27.940
‐ No, no. I‐I don't want it.

27:27.940 --> 27:29.358
‐ You sure?

27:30.359 --> 27:32.861
‐ I'd take an awkward hug though.

27:33.862 --> 27:35.948
‐ Okay.

27:38.951 --> 27:39.993
‐ Huh.

27:40.577 --> 27:43.080
‐ It's not so awkward, huh?
‐ No. That was nice.

27:43.705 --> 27:45.207
Well, I‐I can tell you what happened.

27:45.207 --> 27:49.002
You know, the whole insane story,
unless you need to get going.

27:49.002 --> 27:51.129
‐ No, no, no, no, no.
I would... I'd like to stay.

27:52.673 --> 27:55.217
‐ Oh, well. Okay, good. So,

27:55.217 --> 27:58.053
it‐it was very bizarre.
Get in the elevator...

28:04.101 --> 28:06.228
This is incredible.

28:06.228 --> 28:08.981
‐ Took me long enough, I know.

28:08.981 --> 28:10.858
‐ Yeah, well...

28:10.858 --> 28:13.402
Some things are worth the wait.

28:13.402 --> 28:16.280
‐ Hm. Nice positive‐as‐fuck words

28:16.280 --> 28:18.031
from the man who just
got his good name back.

28:18.031 --> 28:20.033
‐ Yeah.

28:22.661 --> 28:24.621
You okay?

28:26.790 --> 28:29.501
‐ Yeah. I am.

28:32.462 --> 28:33.714
‐ What?

28:35.716 --> 28:38.260
‐ It's just been a long time
since I've said that

28:38.260 --> 28:40.179
and actually meant it.

28:41.680 --> 28:43.098
‐ Come here.

29:53.418 --> 29:56.505
‐ My story really ends with you.

29:57.756 --> 30:00.968
Even though I didn't get to know
all that went on once I left,

30:02.177 --> 30:04.221
a connection was made...

30:04.221 --> 30:06.557
TIM/
among three strangers...

30:06.557 --> 30:10.227
willing to embrace their own messes...

30:11.228 --> 30:13.647
and to recognize

30:13.647 --> 30:16.567
we are all connected.

30:16.567 --> 30:18.569
We started with the question,

30:19.611 --> 30:21.613
"Who is Tim Kono?"

30:23.073 --> 30:26.076
The answer, as it turned out...

30:27.744 --> 30:29.746
we are all Tim Kono.

30:31.999 --> 30:33.667
‐ That was amazing.

30:33.667 --> 30:35.377
‐ I mean, I just...

30:35.377 --> 30:38.005
That‐that's the best
performance you've ever given.

30:38.005 --> 30:40.048
I have nothing left to teach you.

30:40.048 --> 30:43.927
‐ Really? So I can finally add
"voiceover acting" to my resume?

30:45.095 --> 30:47.097
‐ Well, let's not get ahead of ourselves.

30:48.182 --> 30:50.350
And one more toast to Mabel.

30:50.350 --> 30:51.894
- To Mabel Mora.
- Oh stop.

30:51.894 --> 30:54.188
‐ Yeah‐‐ Oh, sorry.

30:54.188 --> 30:57.983
Hey, you know, I'm amazed how
spectacular that ring still looks after

30:57.983 --> 30:59.443
you knocked out a murderer.

30:59.443 --> 31:01.069
Or y‐‐ Charles' girlfriend.

31:01.069 --> 31:03.572
Or ex‐girlfriend. Not sure how you landed.

31:04.907 --> 31:07.409
‐ You're handling this pretty well.

31:07.409 --> 31:09.828
‐ You know, I'm thinking of
putting myself out there again.

31:09.828 --> 31:11.872
I mean, I slept with a murderer!

31:11.872 --> 31:14.541
That is a great story
to tell on a first date.

31:16.877 --> 31:20.714
‐ Does anyone else feel like
there's still a couple of loose ends?

31:20.714 --> 31:22.591
‐ Loose ends?

31:22.591 --> 31:24.593
‐ I don't know. Maybe it's just a feeling.

31:25.594 --> 31:27.638
‐ All I know is that
we've run out of champagne.

31:27.638 --> 31:30.307
‐ Mm. I will get some from my apartment.

31:30.307 --> 31:31.850
‐ Ah...
‐ Thank you, ma'am!

31:31.850 --> 31:33.352
‐ Yep.

31:35.020 --> 31:38.398
‐ So, I was thinking that maybe, uh,

31:38.398 --> 31:41.860
we should do something maybe
more salacious for the next case.

31:41.860 --> 31:43.111
What do you think?

31:43.111 --> 31:44.738
‐ What makes you think
I want to work with you again?

31:44.738 --> 31:47.741
‐ Oh, please. You're nothing without me.

31:47.741 --> 31:49.826
‐ We do make a decent team.

31:49.826 --> 31:52.496
I mean, we could, um,
talk about it tomorrow.

31:52.496 --> 31:53.997
If you're free.

31:53.997 --> 31:55.666
‐ Well, Charles‐Haden Savage,

31:55.666 --> 31:57.709
are you asking me to be your bestie?

31:57.709 --> 32:00.587
‐ "Bestie"? What are we, 14?

32:00.587 --> 32:02.548
‐ No, no, listen. I‐I'm flattered.

32:02.548 --> 32:05.384
So should we meet at 7, or you think...

32:05.384 --> 32:08.011
more of a coffee thing?
Or something like 4?

32:08.011 --> 32:10.430
‐ You‐you know, I'm starting
to regret this alread‐‐

32:10.430 --> 32:12.349
Is that getting louder?

32:12.349 --> 32:14.017
‐ Yeah. Closer, too.

32:17.354 --> 32:19.231
‐ "Get out of the building now."

32:19.231 --> 32:21.525
‐ Exclamation point.
‐ Exclamation point.

32:21.525 --> 32:23.318
‐ Exclamation point.
‐ Three exclamation points.

32:23.318 --> 32:25.571
‐ Whose number is this?
‐ I don't know.

32:26.196 --> 32:28.615
‐ Okay, this is getting scary.
What is going on?

32:29.366 --> 32:30.784
‐ We gotta get Mabel.

32:30.784 --> 32:32.786
- Mabel! Oh my god!
- Oh my god!

32:34.037 --> 32:36.665
Oh my god! Oh my god! Oh my god!

32:36.665 --> 32:38.792
Oh my god! Oh my god! Oh my god!

32:38.792 --> 32:40.502
We gotta get her!
I'm not leaving her here!

32:40.502 --> 32:42.087
‐ Oh, and I would?
‐ Of course you would!

32:42.087 --> 32:43.338
‐ Of course I would!

32:50.596 --> 32:51.889
‐ It's not what you think.

32:54.391 --> 32:56.560
Bunny!
‐ I just opened the door,

32:56.560 --> 32:57.978
and she stumbled in on me!

32:58.604 --> 33:00.063
‐ Is that your knitting needle?

33:00.063 --> 33:01.398
‐ Yes.

33:01.398 --> 33:03.025
Nobody move!

33:03.025 --> 33:04.985
Hands up!

33:18.290 --> 33:21.084
‐ Don't say a fucking word.

33:55.202 --> 33:57.204
‐ This... could be interesting.

33:58.705 --> 34:00.332
‐ Coming this fall,

34:00.332 --> 34:03.335
Only Murderers in the Building.

34:04.169 --> 34:06.296
‐ That's good, Poppy.

34:06.296 --> 34:08.507
That's very good.

34:08.507 --> 34:09.508
I wrote that.

34:39.162 --> 34:42.082
From this moment on, that is mine.
Do you understand?

34:42.082 --> 34:44.710
Say otherwise, and you
will be stocking the NPR fridge

34:44.710 --> 34:47.212
with LaCroix until you're 50.
Do you fucking hear me?
