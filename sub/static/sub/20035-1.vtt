-I miss them when I'm over there.
-I'll bet. Why don'tyou bring 'em back?

04:37.491 --> 04:39.721
Looks likeyou can afford it.
Look at all these baubles.

04:39.793 --> 04:43.092
So what happening, man? What's
goin' on? Still tryin' to kill yourself?

04:43.163 --> 04:46.462
- Something like that.
- What happened to playing pro?

04:46.533 --> 04:49.559
I thoughtyou got picked
for the minors last fall.

04:49.637 --> 04:53.505
Yeah, well,
that didn't quite work out.

04:53.574 --> 04:56.168
You know,
Coach wanted me to play D.

04:56.243 --> 04:59.406
- Whatyou do? Hit him?
- I should've.

05:00.714 --> 05:04.616
-Wastin' your life.
-I just haven't gotten the break I need.

05:04.685 --> 05:08.121
You know, NHL tryouts
are in three months.

05:08.188 --> 05:11.055
John, the breakyou need
is right here.

05:11.125 --> 05:14.117
They'll coveryour travel,
giveyou a 5K bonusjust for showin' up.

05:14.194 --> 05:16.094
And ifyou make the team-- pow.

05:17.164 --> 05:20.531
Ah, come on, Rid.
That's a circus, not a sport.

05:20.601 --> 05:22.865
- It's a pretty sunset though.
- It's the mines.

05:22.936 --> 05:25.769
- What is?
- The dust makes the sunset red.

05:25.839 --> 05:28.205
Look. Come on.
We both know cash is king.

05:28.275 --> 05:30.971
I last two moreyears,
I have enough to retire...

05:31.045 --> 05:32.979
support my family for life.

05:33.047 --> 05:37.040
They love Americans there, especially
baby-faced, boy-next-door types.

05:37.117 --> 05:39.881
It'll bejust like high school.
You run; I block.

05:39.953 --> 05:43.411
Besides, it's where even a dufus-assed
white boy likeyou can get laid.

05:44.758 --> 05:47.352
- Is that right?
- That's right.

05:50.230 --> 05:53.791
I appreciate the offer,
but I should stick around, you know?

05:53.867 --> 05:57.894
- This is myyear to make pro.
- I tried. Good luckwith that.

05:57.971 --> 06:01.498
My flight leaves at 9 p.m. tonight,
in caseyou changeyour mind.

06:05.579 --> 06:09.106
- Thanks for savin' my ass today.
- Anytime.

06:28.936 --> 06:31.871
In another unit, yeah.
They're out back.

07:04.371 --> 07:04.505

- What? What's the matter?

07:45.612 --> 07:48.843
It's Sunday.
The mines are out.

07:49.950 --> 07:51.383
Oh, shit.

08:27.754 --> 08:30.814
Okay! Thirty seconds to go!''

08:35.562 --> 08:38.496
I don't understand a word
you're sayin' to me, sweetheart.

08:38.565 --> 08:43.501
But maybe ifyou say it louder,
I won't understand you even better!

08:45.038 --> 08:48.337
I get it. Your nipples get hard
at the very sight ofme, right?

08:51.778 --> 08:56.010
A new bio on the kid.
Now he's a rodeo champion.

09:31.251 --> 09:32.183
Rollerball

10:24.237 --> 10:27.001

10:32.179 --> 10:34.875
Jonathan.Jonathan.

11:24.731 --> 11:26.562
...Lone Star, Texas.

11:28.201 --> 11:30.795
The Lone Star state--

11:31.638 --> 11:33.765
Hailing from the wide-open plains
ofTexas...

11:33.840 --> 11:37.105
a former rodeo champion
and the first-round draft pick...

11:37.177 --> 11:40.977
by the prestigious National Hockey
League back in the States.

11:41.048 --> 11:43.141
Considered the next Wayne Gretzky...

11:43.216 --> 11:46.652
he turneddownaking's ransom
from the NHL toplayhere...

11:46.720 --> 11:48.881
inarealman's league.

11:48.955 --> 11:51.287
- Holy shit.
- Thesurebetforrookie oftheyear...

11:51.358 --> 11:56.022
who kills his stubble each morning
with a Wilkinson Sword Tri-flex.

11:56.096 --> 12:01.966
Hereheis,
your veryownJonathan Cross.

12:23.056 --> 12:26.787
Please, please, my friends.
Sit down. Have a seat.

12:31.131 --> 12:35.329
You are his boy. Looks
like Alexi's got some hot investors.

12:37.237 --> 12:38.568
- Vodka!
- Vodka!

12:39.840 --> 12:42.866
- Thereyou go. Enjoy.
- You gotyour armadillo on?

12:44.478 --> 12:47.504
Jesus, you're an idiot. Serg!

12:52.652 --> 12:54.313
You wanna be a paraplegic?

12:55.722 --> 12:58.384
You have any idea what those guys
out there can do toyour spine?

12:58.458 --> 13:00.892
- Gotta catch me first, Rid.
- Right.

13:00.961 --> 13:02.929
- It's your face.
- Yes, Mother.

13:02.996 --> 13:05.692
At least do it up.
Stubborn bastard.

13:08.568 --> 13:13.005
Okay, Toba. Big roar now.
Let's hear it. Let's go.

13:13.073 --> 13:16.907
- Great roar, Toba!
- You hang tight up there, okay?

13:16.977 --> 13:19.445
- You too,Jonathan.
- All right.

13:20.514 --> 13:23.039
Hi, I'm the new guy--

13:24.417 --> 13:27.477
All right. Listen up, thugs.
We got our butts kicked last game...

13:27.554 --> 13:29.681
but the headhunter's
not goin' down again.

13:29.756 --> 13:34.318
- Areyou? I didn't hear an answer!
- No!

13:34.394 --> 13:36.726
Let's give 'em something to think about
in case we see 'em in the play-offs.

13:36.796 --> 13:40.596
That means teamwork,
so no more cowboy, hot-dog dog shit.

13:40.667 --> 13:42.430
Can't we all just get along,
Dutch?

13:44.171 --> 13:48.130
Aurora's right.
''No more cowboy, hot-dog dog shit.''

13:54.548 --> 13:57.312
When the Red Horsemen went
to the Golden Horde last month...

13:57.384 --> 13:59.648
they came backwith their tails
between their legs.

13:59.719 --> 14:03.382
Nowthe Horde
comes to Horsemen town.

14:03.456 --> 14:05.947
The wordis ''rematch''...

14:06.026 --> 14:09.985
andthe Horsemen
hopeit's spelled ''payback. ''

14:11.865 --> 14:14.766
A team must go
around the track twice...

14:14.834 --> 14:17.029
maintaining possession
ofthe rollerball...

14:17.103 --> 14:19.162
before they can score.

14:19.239 --> 14:21.173
It's really that simple,
as simple...

14:21.241 --> 14:25.337
as using a Lifestyle female condom
before sex.

14:27.347 --> 14:29.338
The ball must be held
at all times.

14:29.416 --> 14:33.716

14:44.664 --> 14:47.827
andthen they're eligible
toscore.

14:47.901 --> 14:52.133
All you really have to know is
there's only one way to score...

14:52.205 --> 14:54.833
and that's when a player
takes one ofthe balls...

16:43.550 --> 16:46.644
- Drink again.
- Label out.

16:48.121 --> 16:50.089
Put the label out.

17:28.261 --> 17:29.353
Yes!

17:29.429 --> 17:32.694
We are the hottest sports-entertainment
start-up in the world, bar none.

17:35.502 --> 17:39.996
We have to pay a couple ofthe
headliners, but the rest get bollocks.

17:40.073 --> 17:41.973
We can get them to fight
for peanuts.

17:43.276 --> 17:45.267
Whoa, it's about to get interesting!

Hey, look.

18:14.707 --> 18:18.871
A mine monkey on skates!

18:25.118 --> 18:28.918
All the glitz is put on
in the media trailer out back.

18:31.591 --> 18:35.687
We even had a computer
to build a city around it.

18:38.398 --> 18:42.528
Poof. And it becomes Vegas!

18:49.742 --> 18:54.736
We'vegota fightdown there.

19:11.498 --> 19:15.662
What was she thinkin'? We got a fox
in the box, a fox in the box.

19:15.735 --> 19:17.703
They put that fox in the box.

19:22.041 --> 19:24.532

19:47.333 --> 19:49.665
I will not allow this game
to become corrupted...

19:49.736 --> 19:53.297
like so many things
in this part ofthe world.

19:53.373 --> 19:56.308
The integrity ofthe game
must be maintained...

19:56.376 --> 19:58.674
for the people,
to keep their heroes alive.

19:58.745 --> 20:01.578
And to keep them gambling,
ofcourse.

20:09.122 --> 20:10.555
Go, go!

20:14.260 --> 20:17.423
Michael The Assassin - Russian Federation

20:32.412 --> 20:35.643
Areyou crazy? Areyou insane? What are
you doing mixing it up with that guy?

20:35.715 --> 20:37.615
He's doped up. Big deal.

20:37.684 --> 20:40.016
It could be PCP, for all you know.

20:40.086 --> 20:43.715
That dude doesn't feel anything.
Stay the hell away from him.

20:43.790 --> 20:49.285
Payback? How many ofyou will last
through the season with management...

20:49.362 --> 20:52.923
- there watching this sissy performance?
- That woman.

20:52.999 --> 20:55.729
- So go out there and score.
- Come on. Let's stay focused.

20:55.802 --> 20:58.236
We have a lead. All we have to do
is keep up the pressure.

20:58.304 --> 21:01.000
Tell cowboy to pass the ball
once in a while.

21:01.074 --> 21:03.042
- They're keying on him.
- She's right.

21:03.109 --> 21:06.135
Maybe ifshe'd get up in the air,
somebodywould pass her the ball.

21:06.212 --> 21:08.942
Enough! We have a game to play.

21:09.015 --> 21:12.746
- On three: One, two, three! Get some!
- Get some!

21:24.163 --> 21:26.324
- She's wide-open!
- Come on! Throw it!

21:26.399 --> 21:29.994
He bogarts it!
Cross keeps the ball!

21:31.804 --> 21:34.602

22:25.692 --> 22:28.286
Somebody get a medic!

22:34.500 --> 22:37.469
You're okay. Come on.

22:50.717 --> 22:52.947
No, no, no. Start the replay later--

22:55.988 --> 22:57.819
No-- Later! Later!

22:59.058 --> 23:01.253

Toba, you're fine.

24:43.996 --> 24:45.827
And don't screw up.

24:47.166 --> 24:48.463
What?

24:56.409 --> 24:58.707
What thehellis wrong
with the officials?

24:58.778 --> 25:02.236
I mean, the band can sure smell it.
The audience can feel it coming.

25:02.315 --> 25:04.408
Cross isgoingoverthe top!

25:04.483 --> 25:08.351

You actually translated that?
My mother's a pediatrician.

27:08.107 --> 27:10.598
Yes, it's true.

27:26.993 --> 27:29.826
The plane leaves at 8:00 a.m.

27:29.895 --> 27:32.591
That's 8:00 a.m. tomorrow morning.

27:40.706 --> 27:43.470
Hi, I'm the new guy--

27:44.677 --> 27:48.306
My friends, they call me ''Rabbit.''

27:49.148 --> 27:50.308
Really?

27:57.990 --> 27:59.617
What was that?

27:59.692 --> 28:02.627
I think it's something about her
only batting for the home team.

28:21.814 --> 28:23.714
Management told me
you gotta wear the hat from now on.

28:23.783 --> 28:26.718
- Yeah, like hell I do.
- No, I'm serious.

28:26.786 --> 28:30.586
- Management's gonna tell us what to do?
- You got me.

28:30.656 --> 28:33.056
You wear the hat.
You wear the hat.

I told you this is the promised land.
Last one to the club buys.

28:38.030 --> 28:40.362
- You get off!. Asshole!
- Come on!

28:40.433 --> 28:42.765
I'll kickyour ass, Rid.

28:51.310 --> 28:54.336
Shit. Goddamn.

29:13.265 --> 29:14.232
Yeah.

29:37.723 --> 29:40.920
- You guys are nuts!
- I told you! The promised land.

29:40.993 --> 29:42.426
Yes, sir.

29:44.497 --> 29:47.989
Listen. Please take extra-special care
ofthis car, okay?

29:48.067 --> 29:50.126
- Yes.
- Thankyou.

29:50.202 --> 29:53.933
-You ready for Ridley's Great Adventure?
-Yeah. Let's go play ball.

30:04.316 --> 30:06.079
Gentlemen, gentlemen.

30:18.264 --> 30:20.391
- Howdy, y'all.
- That's great.

30:41.020 --> 30:42.885
I love this country.

30:48.227 --> 30:51.219
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
Honeys at 4:00. Yes, ladies.

30:51.297 --> 30:54.289
- Sir Ridley's in the house.
- American ''Horses,'' right?

30:54.366 --> 30:57.164
Absolutely.
And hung like one.

30:57.236 --> 31:01.434
-We don't speak much.
-The way I dig it. You don't speak much.

31:01.507 --> 31:05.637
- ''The way I dig it''?
- You ever tried to get laid?

31:12.084 --> 31:14.245
- Katya, how areyou?
- Look.

31:14.320 --> 31:17.517
- My number. I got my number on.
- She's official. She's got her number.

31:17.590 --> 31:20.650
Congratulations.
It looks beautiful.

31:20.726 --> 31:23.695
What's the matter, Rid? You don't like
the idea ofa number on your face?

31:23.762 --> 31:25.525
You guessed it.

31:25.598 --> 31:28.396
And now we will all get big bonuses,
thanks toyou Uncle Sammys.

31:28.467 --> 31:32.164
ToJonathan and to Ridley.
Thankyou very much.

31:32.238 --> 31:35.696
- This toast should be to Toba.
- To Toba.

31:36.775 --> 31:39.437
Come here. Come here.

31:39.511 --> 31:41.706
To Toba.

31:41.780 --> 31:46.615
Why doyou show me disrespect? You work
24 hours in the mines, it pays nothing.

31:46.685 --> 31:49.245
I broughtyou in here,
and you try to pay.

31:50.789 --> 31:53.781
All right, my gypsy brother.
Have a drink.

31:56.395 --> 31:58.829
A little wound tonight, Denny?

32:01.400 --> 32:05.359
What happened could
have happened to any ofus.

32:05.437 --> 32:07.667
It'sjust--
It's very bad shit, man.

32:08.941 --> 32:11.569
It's a rough game.
That's whywe get paid.

32:11.644 --> 32:14.613
You make a hundred times
what I do.

32:16.548 --> 32:18.778
What's up, Denny?

32:26.959 --> 32:30.656
- What ifit wasn't an accident?
- What areyou talking about?

32:34.466 --> 32:36.263
Show him.

32:40.806 --> 32:43.934
- The chin strap's been cut.
- Where'd you get this?

32:44.910 --> 32:49.210
- I found it in the trainer's office.
- Look at this.

32:54.153 --> 32:56.587
She says the gambling syndicates
probably put them up to it...

32:56.655 --> 32:58.748
or something like that.

32:58.824 --> 33:02.851
- Will you shut up a little bit?
- We need to go tell Petrovich.

33:02.928 --> 33:04.987
No. We'll deal with this
on the track, ourselves.

33:05.064 --> 33:08.397
Toba was almost killed out there,
Rid. He's the owner.

33:08.467 --> 33:12.130
- I wouldn't bother him with it.
- Fine, Captain.

33:12.204 --> 33:15.605
I'll go. Enjoy the party.

33:22.681 --> 33:25.377
No move. Me be back soon.

33:32.491 --> 33:32.624
Tonight was the best game.
Real cowboy shit, huh?

33:32.624 --> 33:35.058
Tonight was the best game.
Real cowboy shit, huh?

33:35.127 --> 33:38.153
- Is he available?
- Ofcourse, foryou.

33:38.230 --> 33:40.255
Mickey, gentlemen, please.

33:47.373 --> 33:49.307
My stallion.

33:50.542 --> 33:52.942
My homie.

33:53.011 --> 33:57.471
Let me introduce my friend. This is
John Buckley from the U.S. Network.

33:57.549 --> 34:01.280
- Enzo Molinari, Canale Cinque.
- Pleasure to meetyou.

34:07.493 --> 34:10.757
And Yuri Kotlev, owner ofthe Horde.
Be careful,Jonathan.

34:10.829 --> 34:15.094
I think he's very angrywith you.
Yuri!

34:15.167 --> 34:18.034
Derek Cannon,
an investor from Montana.

34:18.103 --> 34:22.301
- One ofthose places, you know.
- How doyou do, son? Nice to meetyou.

34:22.373 --> 34:26.174
- Big money. Big money.
- Could I talk toyou for a minute?

34:27.780 --> 34:30.304
Yes, ofcourse.
Please, this way.

34:31.382 --> 34:33.351
What can I do foryou?

34:35.187 --> 34:37.917
I think the chin strap's
been cut.

34:41.427 --> 34:44.554
- Where did you get this?
- It doesn't matter.

34:45.764 --> 34:48.426
You're right.
It doesn't matter.

34:50.302 --> 34:55.501
Ifthat fat swine was behind this,
I will get the owners to take his team.

34:55.574 --> 34:57.804
- May I keep this?
- What areyou gonna do?

34:57.876 --> 35:00.902
I'll take care ofit.
I swear on my mother's grave.

35:07.553 --> 35:09.544
A nice boy, yes?

35:11.757 --> 35:16.524
He's the angriest man in the game.
Hejust doesn't know ityet.

35:17.896 --> 35:21.593
- Borges, you still back there?
- Discreetly.

35:21.667 --> 35:25.034
And how is Mr.Jonathan tonight?
You play good?

35:25.103 --> 35:29.130
How come it always feels like
we got the freeways to ourselves?

35:29.208 --> 35:33.201
We are not a rich country, sir.

35:33.278 --> 35:37.044
Yeah. No shit. So why does everybody
bet their ass on the rollerball?

35:37.115 --> 35:40.016
We call it the Atlantic City syndrome.

35:40.085 --> 35:42.110
Watch whatyou're saying.

35:44.223 --> 35:48.717
My apology,Jonathan.
Our problem, notyour problem.

35:49.962 --> 35:52.522
That's no worry, Borges.
You guys be good tonight.

35:52.598 --> 35:54.759
-Jonathan.
- Don't waitup.

37:57.556 --> 38:00.047
You thinkwe could do this
in a bed sometime?

38:00.125 --> 38:02.525
You know, with sheets and stuff?

38:02.594 --> 38:04.585
We've been through this.

38:05.731 --> 38:07.756
It should be our secret.

38:09.868 --> 38:13.497
How could I forget?
''It could be used against us!''

38:17.342 --> 38:21.335
Against me. You're untouchable.

38:22.648 --> 38:26.106
Come on, Aurora.
You don't need to hide all the time.

38:26.184 --> 38:30.143
- I don't.
- Yes, you do. You live in the dark.

38:31.490 --> 38:35.688
- Your face isn't as bad as you think.
- I know that.

38:35.761 --> 38:39.390
Yeah. That's whyyou always
turn your left side to people.

38:40.699 --> 38:42.860
I don't always turn.

38:50.842 --> 38:53.436
Toba's helmet was cut.

38:55.714 --> 38:58.148
I took it to Petrovich.

38:59.217 --> 39:02.380
- And you think that does some good?
- He seemed pretty upset about it.

39:02.454 --> 39:05.252
I think he'll take it
to the Horde owner.

39:06.858 --> 39:08.450
You are so naive.

39:10.729 --> 39:13.129
- They knew.
- They knew what?

39:13.198 --> 39:16.395
One ofthe TV guys
put me onto this.

39:16.468 --> 39:19.301
Let's see ifI can call it up.

39:20.639 --> 39:23.836
Here. Look.
That's Toba getting hit.

39:23.909 --> 39:27.606
- It's caught clearly on five cameras.
- So theywere following the action.

39:27.679 --> 39:30.079
But let me back the feeds
up five seconds.

39:33.085 --> 39:35.747
Now look.
One camera follows the action...

39:35.821 --> 39:39.757
and four cameras follow a simpleminded
boy at the other end ofthe track.

39:39.825 --> 39:42.385
Theywere called
and told to get on him...

39:42.461 --> 39:45.521
fifteen seconds before it happened.

39:45.597 --> 39:50.193
The Horde did not make that happen,
Jonathan, not on their own.

39:51.103 --> 39:54.504
This TV guy.
You know where to find him?

40:04.082 --> 40:06.016
- What's going on?
- Demonstration.

40:06.084 --> 40:09.713
It is the headquarters
for the mines. Hang on.

40:17.863 --> 40:21.026
What doyou want me to do?

40:26.571 --> 40:29.096
- Get out ofthe car. Get out.
- What's going on?

40:29.174 --> 40:32.735
-Just trust me. Get out. Hurry.
- Aurora, what's--

40:32.811 --> 40:35.678
Quick,Jonathan.
Come over here.

40:37.082 --> 40:39.642
Hurry.Jonathan.

40:44.289 --> 40:48.157
-Jonathan, get in here. Get in here.
- What the hell's goin' on?

40:48.226 --> 40:50.854
Get in here.

40:52.964 --> 40:55.558
That's my goddamn car!

40:57.435 --> 41:01.769
That is notyour car.
It belongs to Petrovich.

41:01.840 --> 41:04.104
He'll have another one foryou
by tomorrow. Come on.

41:04.176 --> 41:07.668
Goddamn. This is unbelievable.

41:09.514 --> 41:13.382
Jonathan, don'tyou know they can
trackyou with these things? Come on.

41:16.388 --> 41:18.583
- What's with thisplace?
- The state housing authority...

41:18.657 --> 41:21.455
sold offthe apartments,
then theywent out ofbusiness.

41:21.526 --> 41:24.222
- So what?
- They never sold offthe hallways.

41:24.296 --> 41:27.595
- There is no one to take care ofthem.
- No shit.

41:31.169 --> 41:32.602
Sergei?

41:47.385 --> 41:49.285
Don't kill him!

41:49.354 --> 41:52.255
Let me guess.
This isn'tyour friend Sergei, is it?

41:55.293 --> 41:57.386
- Sergei's gone.
- Ofcourse he is.

41:57.462 --> 42:00.260
I suppose we can't call the police
about it either, right?

42:00.332 --> 42:03.665
Let's get out ofhere.
He may be the police.

42:27.726 --> 42:30.320
You almost missed the flight.

42:33.198 --> 42:35.257
Good morning.
It's a beautiful day, huh?

42:37.836 --> 42:40.168
- Yeah.
- And it was a long night, huh?

42:40.238 --> 42:44.265
It was, yeah. I partied,
the usual thing, with the team.

42:45.377 --> 42:49.177
We found your car.
Areyou all right?

42:49.247 --> 42:51.613
Yeah, yeah.
I just had a little accident.

42:51.683 --> 42:53.742
I'm sorry to hear that.

43:01.192 --> 43:05.458
Serokin, did you follow me
last night?

43:05.530 --> 43:09.557
Just found your car, that's all.
Wouldn't wantyou to be without.

43:12.370 --> 43:15.669
So there was a goon in the apartment,
and the guy booked out in a hurry.

43:15.740 --> 43:19.403
There might have been a thousand reasons
why. He might've been lying to Aurora.

43:23.448 --> 43:25.382
Let's say they are
screwing with the game.

43:25.450 --> 43:28.146
- Then?
- Yeah? Then what?

43:31.856 --> 43:35.849
Then nothing. Status quo.
We play, we win.

43:35.927 --> 43:38.987
And ifit gets too sick,
we walk.

44:01.953 --> 44:05.548
Come on, guys.
I've got meetings.

44:20.372 --> 44:23.864
- Can't I just take a cab to the hotel?
- When the circus came to town...

44:23.942 --> 44:26.206
did they let the elephants
take a cab to the hotel?

44:26.277 --> 44:29.542
You're the elephant.
Get in the car, son.

44:29.614 --> 44:31.673
One, two, tres, cuatro.

45:19.564 --> 45:22.795
Itisanhonorandapleasure tobe
broadcasting toyou this evening...

45:22.867 --> 45:25.062
with a crowd pushing 50,000...

45:25.136 --> 45:28.799
in this beautiful desert city
on the shores ofthe blue--

45:28.873 --> 45:30.636
blue--

45:40.552 --> 45:44.784
-Jeez, this outfit's got a lot ofmoney.
-What is that?

45:46.558 --> 45:49.823
I'd say it's a good time
in a can.

46:07.078 --> 46:09.273
Beep, beep.

46:13.718 --> 46:16.846
Come on! Come on! Come on in here
and getyour ass kicked!

46:16.921 --> 46:19.913
Come on! I loveyou.

46:25.230 --> 46:25.330
Tahli, what channel did you say
you gave us in your territory?

46:25.330 --> 46:30.063
Tahli, what channel did you say
you gave us in your territory?

46:30.135 --> 46:34.401
- 1 09.
- 1 09. I see.

46:34.472 --> 46:36.633
1 -frigging-0-9.

46:37.642 --> 46:42.670
They do origami on channel six
ofyour silly hair ball network!

46:42.747 --> 46:44.612
You ungrateful cretin!

46:47.952 --> 46:52.013
I will kill you myself!.
I will disappearyourwhole family!

46:52.090 --> 46:57.255
You wanna do business with us,
we are on channels one through five.

46:57.328 --> 46:58.920
Got it?

47:04.002 --> 47:06.163
You got that?

47:10.341 --> 47:12.536
Goddamn mouse.

47:13.711 --> 47:17.647
- Goal, yes, goal.
- The Red Horsemen are rolling over--

48:24.349 --> 48:25.873
Stop!

48:36.928 --> 48:39.055
Stop!

48:52.777 --> 48:55.371
What? Areyou from Omaha or something?
It was only a matter oftime...

48:55.446 --> 48:57.710
before one these creeps realized
that their take would go up...

48:57.782 --> 48:59.977
as soon as they got a little blood
on the track.

49:00.051 --> 49:03.145
What? Doyou think they sit around
struggling with the morality ofit?

49:03.221 --> 49:05.519
- They're gonna kill somebody.
- That's what I'm talkin' about.

49:05.590 --> 49:09.390
Come on. I make more in a season than I
would ten years doin' people's taxes.

49:09.460 --> 49:11.860
They're not gonna let anything
happen to us. They need us.

49:11.929 --> 49:14.864
Sojust closeyour eyes
and take the money, okay?

50:05.850 --> 50:08.318
Sergei, the TV guy?

50:10.088 --> 50:13.216
They found him at the border,
his throat cut, his mouth sewn shut.

50:14.492 --> 50:16.460
What's up?

50:28.272 --> 50:30.297
You don't look so good.
What's going on?

50:33.344 --> 50:37.781
Well, you see, you hit the pod ramp
andjump, and I cross under and go.

50:37.849 --> 50:40.181
And then you shot in the free throw,
and then you did the 440.

50:40.251 --> 50:43.311
So I wasn't sure,
but I thinkyou scored the touchdown.

50:45.857 --> 50:48.382
- Got it?
- Absolutely.

50:48.459 --> 50:51.155
I scored a touchdown
and I win.

50:52.263 --> 50:54.925
Gotya. Gotya.

51:01.439 --> 51:02.633
We'll beat 'em!

51:03.708 --> 51:06.506
- This MongolBlue Team is on fire...
- We'll beat them!

51:06.577 --> 51:08.169
andinsane!

51:08.246 --> 51:11.079
They're latheredup
likeaSiberian wolfpack...

51:11.149 --> 51:14.676
readyto tearthe Reds
limb from limb.

51:14.752 --> 51:17.414
You're not wearing
your spine protector, right?

51:17.488 --> 51:19.979
That's right.

51:34.906 --> 51:36.999
With over a quarter left to play,
it's the Horsemen--

51:41.546 --> 51:43.377
I see.

51:49.387 --> 51:51.821
- You should make some arrangements.
- Alexi, I'm on--

51:51.889 --> 51:54.119
I don't want problems!

51:54.192 --> 51:56.319
I want solutions.

52:10.441 --> 52:12.033
It's in the works.

52:28.392 --> 52:32.192
We got ourselves
a motorcycle race here!

52:42.240 --> 52:45.266
Whoa!Aurorajustgothammered!

52:45.343 --> 52:49.336
Thatson ofabitch

52:54.452 --> 52:57.717
Here's your bike, little lady.
Hope I didn't bend it.

52:58.923 --> 53:02.791
- Do I wish you spoke English.
- I speak itjust fine, asshole!

53:30.354 --> 53:31.685
Bail out!

54:11.729 --> 54:13.822
Easy, fellas.

54:13.898 --> 54:15.832
Come on, get him out.

54:21.439 --> 54:22.701
We're out ofhere.

54:45.429 --> 54:47.761
Ridley, my man.

54:47.832 --> 54:51.029
- How areyou?
- I feel like Freddy Krueger.

54:53.437 --> 54:56.372
- How is he, Doctor?
- I'm good. I'm good.

54:56.440 --> 54:59.432
- He should be resting.
- I feel fine. I can play.

54:59.510 --> 55:01.444
- You sure about that?
- I feel fine.

55:01.512 --> 55:04.709
- Areyou up to it?
- It was, after all,just an accident.

55:04.782 --> 55:07.273
You don't know how glad I am
to hearyou say that.

55:09.353 --> 55:12.288
All right, that's it.
Come on, let's go. Out.

55:14.025 --> 55:15.959
You promised me
you'd stop this.

55:16.027 --> 55:19.485
Dear God, your tone.
How have I denied you?

55:19.563 --> 55:22.726
I have madeyou a rich man,
an international star.

55:22.800 --> 55:24.825
I created a sport
thatyou could thrive in.

55:24.902 --> 55:29.066
I have given you total freedom to do
as you please and even a satellite TV...

55:29.140 --> 55:32.667
and asked for one thing: your trust.

55:32.743 --> 55:35.837
So will both my studs
be at practice tomorrow?

55:35.913 --> 55:37.847
- Yes, sir.
- Excellent.

55:37.915 --> 55:40.179
Horsemen, number one.

55:40.251 --> 55:45.211
Watch them. Ifthey take a shit,
I want to know what it smells like.

55:59.537 --> 56:01.437
Let's go.

56:16.921 --> 56:18.354
Wait.

56:21.158 --> 56:22.750
Don't move.

56:36.707 --> 56:38.572
Close the doors.
It's cold as hell.

56:38.642 --> 56:40.576
Please, the door.

56:40.644 --> 56:42.578
Hey, the door!

56:45.216 --> 56:47.150
Come on. Come on, Denny.

56:49.653 --> 56:52.178
- What about our passports?
- Katya trashed it.

56:52.256 --> 56:54.190
- She couldn't get them.
- She's afraid.

56:54.258 --> 56:56.488
- I think they have something on her.
- We have to wing it, then.

56:56.560 --> 56:58.323
Get the cash from my place?

56:58.395 --> 57:00.590
You apartment was being watched
all the time.

57:04.468 --> 57:06.402
The players put this together.

57:14.445 --> 57:15.878
Thanks, Den.

57:18.048 --> 57:21.347
- Thank them.
- I don't know what to say.

57:21.418 --> 57:24.649
Here, look.
The nearest border is Russia.

57:26.824 --> 57:30.225
You have two crossings here
at the Russian border-- here and here.

57:30.294 --> 57:33.730
One is by the river. Ifyou leave now,
from hereyou can make it by morning.

57:33.798 --> 57:37.666
-I thoughtyou two were coming with us--
-He has family here. I have my mother.

57:37.735 --> 57:40.602
And ifyou don't want them to disappear
or have an accident--

57:40.671 --> 57:43.196
You can never really leave.

57:43.274 --> 57:45.401
Aurora, wait a minute.
Areyou gonna be okay--

57:45.476 --> 57:47.068
You stop.

57:54.552 --> 57:56.986
Beforeyou say something
even more stupid.

58:07.164 --> 58:09.428
Get the light
over there on the wall.

58:27.952 --> 58:32.412
There's no way I'm gonna die
in this shithole ofa country. No way.

58:33.190 --> 58:35.124
We left the rest ofthe team, Rid.

58:35.192 --> 58:37.752
How many times areyou gonna
have to getyour head handed toyou...

58:37.828 --> 58:40.854
beforeyou stop picking fights
with people who are too big?

58:40.931 --> 58:43.263
This isn't some college coach
you canjust flick off.

58:43.334 --> 58:45.564
These are dangerous people, man.

58:47.404 --> 58:49.895
Look,Jon, she's safe.

58:52.409 --> 58:55.469
She's safe.
Nobody knew aboutyou two.

59:06.690 --> 59:08.851
Shit. We have company.

59:16.066 --> 59:18.534
Looks like they brought
the whole Russian cavalry, Rid.

59:18.602 --> 59:21.901
Great. We're being chased
by our own bodyguards.

59:30.614 --> 59:32.980
Here they come, Rid.
They're on your bumper.

59:33.050 --> 59:35.541
The fender.
Squeeze them!

59:35.619 --> 59:37.177
- Come on!
- Oh, shit!

59:41.892 --> 59:43.860
Come on,
you son ofa bitch!

59:53.304 --> 59:56.205
- That ain't gonna work twice.
- They're still coming on us.

59:56.273 --> 59:58.867
- Remember Squeak Harris?
- Ofcourse I remember.

59:58.943 --> 01:00:00.535
Remember how he died?

01:00:02.112 --> 01:00:04.478
- Change with me.
- Now, listen, Rid--

01:00:04.548 --> 01:00:05.981
Oh, shit!

01:00:08.886 --> 01:00:11.787
- Let's rock and roll!
- One, two, three!

01:00:41.318 --> 01:00:42.307
God!

01:00:43.187 --> 01:00:47.089
Goddamn it, this road
isn't even paved!

01:00:47.157 --> 01:00:49.455
Listen, I haven't seen lights
in about an hour.

01:00:49.526 --> 01:00:51.653
Why don't we
back it offa little?

01:00:51.729 --> 01:00:54.459
How fast are we going, anyway?

01:00:54.531 --> 01:00:56.829
I don't know.
It's in klicks.

01:00:56.900 --> 01:00:59.368
How fast is it in klicks, then?

01:00:59.436 --> 01:01:01.301
1 1 0, 1 20.

01:01:01.372 --> 01:01:03.306
That's not so bad.

01:01:05.909 --> 01:01:08.434
Ridley, that's in miles per hour!

01:01:08.512 --> 01:01:11.208
- So what?
- ''So what?''

01:01:11.281 --> 01:01:15.945
You're going 1 20 miles per hour
on a Hog on a dirt road!

01:01:16.020 --> 01:01:18.614
It's not an off-road bike, Rid!

01:01:20.224 --> 01:01:22.784
Ten klicks to the border.
Chill.

01:01:22.860 --> 01:01:25.624
Yeah, that ten klicks
is gonna be a long walk...

01:01:25.696 --> 01:01:28.256
ifone ofthese tires goes out.

01:01:31.869 --> 01:01:34.531
Oh, shit.
Ridley, we've got lights!

01:01:35.372 --> 01:01:37.431
Don't look!
Watch the road!

01:01:37.508 --> 01:01:40.534
- Looks like they're gaining on us.
- What?

01:01:42.212 --> 01:01:45.773
Yeah, they're definitely gaining
on us, Ridley, and fast!

01:01:45.849 --> 01:01:49.808
- What the hell could they be driving?
- My limit's 1 50, man.

01:01:53.390 --> 01:01:55.824
Faster! What in the world
are they driving?

01:02:00.330 --> 01:02:01.661
Shit!

01:02:21.051 --> 01:02:22.643
Come on, baby!

01:02:24.021 --> 01:02:26.012
Who said this isn't
an off-road bike?

01:02:28.659 --> 01:02:32.720
I've got news foryou, Rid.
They've got an off-road airplane.

01:02:51.949 --> 01:02:55.680
- There it is.
- That's it? That's the border?

01:02:55.752 --> 01:02:58.220
What doyou want,
a Stuckies and a casino? Hang on.

01:04:10.494 --> 01:04:12.860
We can make it.

01:04:12.930 --> 01:04:14.864
It won't work. Not double.

01:04:14.932 --> 01:04:16.194
Then you go.

01:04:16.266 --> 01:04:18.962
Don't get saintly on me, Ridley.

01:04:19.036 --> 01:04:22.096
- I gotyou into this! You go!
- Your kids! Go home!

01:04:23.040 --> 01:04:25.634
Ridley, I'll be fine.
I promise.

01:04:25.709 --> 01:04:27.870
Get to the American consulate
on the other side.

01:04:27.945 --> 01:04:30.345
They'll have me on a plane
first thing in the morning.

01:04:32.583 --> 01:04:36.212
- Go! Get out ofhere! Go!
- You better make it.

01:04:44.828 --> 01:04:48.457
Closeyour eyes and take the money.
God forgive me.

01:04:52.469 --> 01:04:55.097
Wait. Let's see ifhe makes it.

01:04:57.908 --> 01:04:59.273
Come on.

01:05:08.685 --> 01:05:10.118
Magnificent.

01:05:39.616 --> 01:05:41.413
Let's go.

01:05:41.485 --> 01:05:44.613
Make sureyou tip
the border guards well.

01:05:57.000 --> 01:05:58.592
Did you--

01:05:58.669 --> 01:06:01.763
Did you really think I could
letyou pull a stunt like that...

01:06:01.838 --> 01:06:04.568
even ifI wanted to,
in front ofthem?

01:06:06.143 --> 01:06:08.703
How could you do that to me?

01:06:08.779 --> 01:06:11.441
How could you be so...

01:06:13.050 --> 01:06:15.143
thoughtless?

01:06:15.218 --> 01:06:17.709
All right.
We start again.

01:06:19.489 --> 01:06:23.721
I'll giveyou a bonus of$1 00,000,
U.S., payable however.

01:06:23.794 --> 01:06:26.786
You play through the championship.

01:06:26.863 --> 01:06:30.458
Play till the goddamn
cable deal closes...

01:06:30.534 --> 01:06:32.934
then you may go whereyou wish.

01:06:33.770 --> 01:06:36.796
I'll even giveyou
a retirement game.

01:06:37.507 --> 01:06:39.441
Go fuckyourself.

01:06:44.948 --> 01:06:46.882
Throw that sack ofshit out ofhere!

01:06:46.950 --> 01:06:48.884
Get rid ofhim!

01:07:13.510 --> 01:07:15.478
What are we going
to do with you, eh?

01:07:16.780 --> 01:07:20.375
In the old regime, Petrovich was
above the official rank in Spetnaz...

01:07:20.450 --> 01:07:22.884
before the age of30.

01:07:22.953 --> 01:07:27.083
KGB colonels used to cross the street
when the saw him come.

01:07:27.157 --> 01:07:29.125
Now they all line up
to grovel in the dust.

01:07:29.192 --> 01:07:31.126
Would you like a drink ofwater?

01:07:33.764 --> 01:07:35.698
You obviously don't care
anything foryourself...

01:07:35.766 --> 01:07:37.631
but haveyou thought
about the girl?

01:07:39.102 --> 01:07:42.230
Oh, dear boy, you don't imagine
you have any secrets, doyou?

01:07:42.305 --> 01:07:46.036
Why doyou think she's still alive?
Because Petrovich needs you.

01:07:46.109 --> 01:07:49.340
He'll giveyoujust about anything
you want, including her life...

01:07:49.413 --> 01:07:52.246
ifyou playyour cards right.

01:07:53.784 --> 01:07:56.446
You have an opportunity here.

01:07:56.520 --> 01:07:59.421
You might call it
the opportunity ofa lifetime.

01:08:37.060 --> 01:08:41.622
You see Yevgeny over there,
so full ofhimselfnow?

01:08:42.799 --> 01:08:44.733
He used to work
in the post office.

01:08:44.801 --> 01:08:46.962
I introduced him
to the proper financing...

01:08:47.037 --> 01:08:49.403
and now he owns the mines.

01:08:49.473 --> 01:08:51.532
Yeah, making a fortune.

01:08:51.608 --> 01:08:53.542
He keeps the miners in line.

01:08:53.609 --> 01:08:56.807
Good business. Good business.

01:08:56.880 --> 01:08:59.814
You might wonderwhy
I'm not in it myself.

01:09:01.318 --> 01:09:04.287
I don't need to own the mines.
Doyou know why?

01:09:05.421 --> 01:09:08.823
Because I own the man
who owns the mines.

01:09:08.892 --> 01:09:11.486
All he has, I have.
Same with the supermarkets...

01:09:11.560 --> 01:09:14.256
the TV station, locomotive plant.

01:09:15.966 --> 01:09:17.627
I don't need
a political position...

01:09:17.701 --> 01:09:20.295
because I own the men who do.

01:09:22.805 --> 01:09:26.104
We learn to separate ourselves
from humanity...

01:09:26.176 --> 01:09:30.272
likeyou,Jonathan,
separateyourselffrom your teammates.

01:09:34.084 --> 01:09:36.018
You can keepyour 1 00K.

01:09:38.154 --> 01:09:40.087
But I do like
the view from up here.

01:09:42.893 --> 01:09:44.827
No, I want more.

01:09:46.029 --> 01:09:48.554
I want ownership--
part ofthe media rights...

01:09:48.631 --> 01:09:50.657
the gambling revenues,
the works.

01:09:53.636 --> 01:09:56.504
Jonathan, areyou fooling with me?

01:10:01.044 --> 01:10:04.013
Come on, Alexi, we both want
the same thing here, don't we?

01:10:10.053 --> 01:10:11.987
Good. Very good.

01:10:12.055 --> 01:10:14.523
Let Serokin takeyou back home.

01:10:14.591 --> 01:10:16.752
You've got a big night
ahead ofyou.

01:10:22.699 --> 01:10:24.530
What?

01:10:25.902 --> 01:10:27.836
Aurora's kind ofbugging me.

01:10:27.904 --> 01:10:29.895
You know,
getting way too serious.

01:10:29.973 --> 01:10:32.965
I hate that too. Women.

01:10:33.043 --> 01:10:34.476
Yeah.

01:10:35.579 --> 01:10:39.242
I want her out ofmy life.
Do me a favor and trade her.

01:10:39.316 --> 01:10:42.683
No problem.
People disappear all the time.

01:10:42.752 --> 01:10:45.744
No, trade her, Alexi.
Just trade her. I like the lady.

01:10:45.822 --> 01:10:48.586
I don't want her disappeared.
I just want her gone, okay?

01:10:48.658 --> 01:10:50.319
All right.

01:10:50.393 --> 01:10:52.327
I'll do that.

01:10:57.467 --> 01:11:01.198
Playwell tonight.
Playwell.

01:11:10.714 --> 01:11:14.309
Gave me a lot ofshit
about wanting to become a partner.

01:11:15.885 --> 01:11:18.376
Just cover to get the girl out.

01:11:19.255 --> 01:11:21.746
Did you give him that?

01:11:21.825 --> 01:11:23.816
I thought it was
too subtle for him.

01:11:24.995 --> 01:11:27.862
So, the first chance he gets,
he'll bolt.

01:11:27.931 --> 01:11:32.163
Shit! I'm this close
to a North American cable deal!

01:11:34.437 --> 01:11:38.134
Well, Maybe there is one thing
we can do to turn this to a profit.

01:11:38.208 --> 01:11:40.802
You did promise him a retirement game,
after all.

01:11:45.582 --> 01:11:50.281
Sanjay, you are a rat,
butyou are my rat, and I loveyou.

01:11:50.353 --> 01:11:52.548
Go ahead.
Trade the girl.

01:11:57.260 --> 01:11:59.490
Trade the girl to the Horde.

01:11:59.562 --> 01:12:01.496
But we're playing them tonight.

01:12:01.564 --> 01:12:03.589
He wants her gone.

01:12:03.667 --> 01:12:05.828
Life is full
oflittle disappointments.

01:12:07.003 --> 01:12:09.130
Make sure they get
a number on her.

01:12:49.813 --> 01:12:51.872
We heard you were in
a rock-climbing accident.

01:12:51.948 --> 01:12:53.882
Areyou all right?

01:12:55.251 --> 01:12:56.445
Yeah.

01:12:56.519 --> 01:12:58.453
You know me.
I'm hard to hurt.

01:12:58.521 --> 01:13:01.285
Where's Ridley?
You guys are always together.

01:13:03.426 --> 01:13:04.859
Yeah.

01:13:59.983 --> 01:14:01.507
Be careful.

01:14:13.663 --> 01:14:15.756
Ladiesandgentlemen,
this is whatit'sallabout--

01:14:15.832 --> 01:14:19.029
one hard-fought struggle for
all the marbles.

01:14:19.102 --> 01:14:21.730
And the Red Horsemen--

01:14:21.805 --> 01:14:24.467
There is unbelievable tension
in thisarena.

01:14:24.541 --> 01:14:26.702
Thereare fourteams
in the quarterfinals...

01:14:26.776 --> 01:14:28.710
but without thehelp
ofMarcus Ridley...

01:14:28.778 --> 01:14:30.939
who was crippled by
a sudden attack ofmalaria...

01:14:31.014 --> 01:14:34.313
whichhe contractedin the tropics
onanarchaeologicaldig.

01:14:34.384 --> 01:14:35.942
Malaria?

01:14:36.019 --> 01:14:37.953
Ifthey'll buy it,
I'll sell it.

01:14:56.506 --> 01:15:00.033
- Ridley's not sick, is he?
- Don't get in this. Stay out ofit.

01:15:00.810 --> 01:15:03.643
- You shouldn't go out there.
- I've got to.

01:15:03.713 --> 01:15:07.774
That's how I got him to send
Aurora away. He made it real clear.

01:15:07.851 --> 01:15:10.820
- Where are they sending her?
- What do I care...

01:15:10.887 --> 01:15:13.355
just as long as it's
away from here?

01:15:13.423 --> 01:15:15.391
What makes you think
you can trust him?

01:15:15.458 --> 01:15:19.155
I don't have a choice.
You can't help me, Denny.

01:15:35.745 --> 01:15:37.645
It's quite simple.

01:16:25.228 --> 01:16:29.324
The Golden Horde, however, seem tohave
severaltransfers from otherteams--

01:16:54.791 --> 01:16:57.225
Hey, little lady,
I see they got a number on you.

01:16:57.293 --> 01:17:00.319
Nice. Very nice.

01:17:14.377 --> 01:17:16.709
Yeah! Yeah!

01:17:18.348 --> 01:17:21.749
Get the goddamn camera
out ofmy face, asswipe!

01:17:35.732 --> 01:17:40.135
And now, for all ofyou out there,
a surprise is on the way.

01:17:40.203 --> 01:17:42.933
Despite earlierreports
ofarock-climbingaccident...

01:17:43.006 --> 01:17:44.598
he's comingback.

01:17:44.674 --> 01:17:47.802
Despite thepleadingofhis trainers
andthe threats ofhis doctors...

01:17:47.877 --> 01:17:49.572
he's comingback.

01:17:49.645 --> 01:17:52.512
He's comingback
forthelove ofthegame.

01:17:52.582 --> 01:17:56.018
He's comingback
foryouandforme.

01:17:56.085 --> 01:17:59.748

01:18:01.858 --> 01:18:03.086

01:18:36.526 --> 01:18:39.825
Look. Bravo!

01:18:41.864 --> 01:18:44.799
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
What's this?

01:18:44.867 --> 01:18:46.801
Last minute rule changes.

01:18:46.869 --> 01:18:48.166
You understand that?

01:18:52.041 --> 01:18:54.407
They give this message toyou.

01:18:54.477 --> 01:18:59.073
''Playwell, and she will be
on the Horde team playing tonight.''

01:19:01.184 --> 01:19:03.414
Ladiesandgentlemen,
aspecialannouncement.

01:19:03.486 --> 01:19:06.250
Asyouallknow, at thelast
owners'meeting in Odessa...

01:19:06.322 --> 01:19:09.519
certain rule changes
were proposed and adopted.

01:19:09.592 --> 01:19:11.526
In the finaleliminationround...

01:19:11.594 --> 01:19:15.291
normal rules and penalties
are to be suspended.

01:19:18.134 --> 01:19:19.396
What are they doing?

01:19:21.971 --> 01:19:27.603
Thegame willbeplayedwith
no fouls calledandnopenalties.

01:19:27.677 --> 01:19:30.737
What is this shit?
There's no such rules--

01:19:30.813 --> 01:19:35.045
They're going to kill someone.

01:19:46.629 --> 01:19:49.029
No penalties.

01:19:49.098 --> 01:19:51.396
This is gonna be interesting.

01:19:51.467 --> 01:19:54.300
He tattooed her face.

01:19:54.370 --> 01:19:57.203
- What areyou gonna do?
- Play the goddamn game, I guess.

01:20:04.380 --> 01:20:07.144
You ever see thugs like that
on the bench before?

01:20:07.216 --> 01:20:09.150
This will make us, my friend.

01:20:09.218 --> 01:20:11.345
This will make us.

01:20:11.420 --> 01:20:14.548

01:22:32.495 --> 01:22:34.554
Holy shit, he's wearing
a spine protector.

01:22:34.630 --> 01:22:36.621

You see?
The show isjust getting started.

01:23:19.809 --> 01:23:23.301
That's about the hardest hit
I've ever seen!

01:23:28.684 --> 01:23:32.245
I got the Asian flu.
Come on, baby! Yeah!

01:23:33.356 --> 01:23:35.449
What the hell are they doing?

01:23:35.524 --> 01:23:37.253
Yeah!

01:23:37.326 --> 01:23:39.419
This may be getting out ofhand.

01:23:39.495 --> 01:23:41.429
Maybe we should call
the whole thing off.

01:23:43.165 --> 01:23:45.463
The Redcoach is trying
to calla time-out...

01:23:45.534 --> 01:23:48.731

No, goddamn it, she's right.
Get offthe track.

01:24:04.887 --> 01:24:06.354
Is anybody gonna stop this?

01:24:06.422 --> 01:24:09.914
- We should cut the feed.
- No, leave it.

01:24:11.227 --> 01:24:14.219
Get offthe track, Katya.
Denekin, get out ofthis.

01:24:15.965 --> 01:24:17.023
Dumb cowboy.

01:24:20.970 --> 01:24:23.131
You don't have to do this.

01:24:27.743 --> 01:24:29.677
The man wants a show, Rid.

01:24:30.746 --> 01:24:32.873
I guess we'll have to give him one.

01:24:51.734 --> 01:24:53.634
Punk!

01:25:21.797 --> 01:25:23.697
Get back out there!

01:25:35.311 --> 01:25:39.213
Cut the satellite feed.
I said cut it.

01:25:46.589 --> 01:25:49.490
No more ofthis. Enough!

01:25:54.497 --> 01:25:58.558
Don'tyou see?
They're killing him...

01:25:59.435 --> 01:26:01.426
for the ratings!

01:26:21.223 --> 01:26:24.920
- That's not in the script!
- Hey, sit down!

01:26:24.994 --> 01:26:28.589
Open your eyes, fool.
The world's about to blow up.

01:26:28.664 --> 01:26:30.894
Didn'tyou hear me? Sit down.

01:26:30.966 --> 01:26:33.457
Screwyou.

01:26:33.536 --> 01:26:36.664
You don't control us anymore.

01:27:10.573 --> 01:27:12.370
Listen to them.

01:27:22.718 --> 01:27:25.186
I'd better go and sort this out.

01:28:21.010 --> 01:28:22.375
Do it.

01:28:25.180 --> 01:28:26.238
Do it!

01:28:29.852 --> 01:28:31.820
Holy shit!

01:29:05.320 --> 01:29:06.582
Go, go.

01:30:23.398 --> 01:30:25.992
Bravo.
Jolly good show and all that.

01:30:26.869 --> 01:30:29.895
I wonderwhat he was looking for.

01:30:31.340 --> 01:30:33.103
These probably.

01:30:36.845 --> 01:30:39.336
Well, youngJonathan...

01:30:39.414 --> 01:30:41.609
you've done marvelouslywell.

01:30:41.683 --> 01:30:43.878
But one ofthe basic rules
in this sort ofthing...

01:30:43.952 --> 01:30:47.513
is thatyou must
never kill a tyrant...

01:30:47.589 --> 01:30:50.524
unless you've made an arrangement
with his successor.

01:30:52.461 --> 01:30:54.429
You do see what I mean,
don'tyou?

01:30:55.531 --> 01:30:58.591
Yeah.
It means I'm not doneyet.

01:31:21.490 --> 01:31:23.890
This gamemaybe over.

01:31:56.225 --> 01:31:58.750
Hey, it's me.
It's me.

01:32:03.999 --> 01:32:06.229
You may have started yourself
a revolution.

01:32:07.402 --> 01:32:09.893
Get some ofthese
shotgun pellets removed.

01:32:09.972 --> 01:32:13.203
- Nah, he missed me.
- Not entirely, he didn't.

01:32:22.117 --> 01:32:25.280
- What are they doing?
- You stood up one ofthe monsters...

01:32:25.354 --> 01:32:28.448
that run their lives,
and they sawyou do it.

01:32:36.365 --> 01:32:39.664
- Where are we headed?
- To a doctor, to start with.

01:32:39.735 --> 01:32:42.135
And then ifyou're able...

01:32:42.204 --> 01:32:44.729
I thought I might
takeyou home to my bed.
