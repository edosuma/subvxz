I'm sad and also happy
that this worked on you.

16:12.323 --> 16:15.424
I can't believe I never saw this before.

16:15.493 --> 16:16.992
Ugh. I feel sick.

16:17.061 --> 16:18.627
I mean, I guess it makes sense, right?

16:18.696 --> 16:21.163
Eileen and Sheila
are basically the same person.

16:21.265 --> 16:24.433
Pat... you're my best friend.

16:24.535 --> 16:25.501
Yeah.

16:25.569 --> 16:29.705
But if you are feeling
a tingle for Eileen,

16:29.807 --> 16:31.440
it's the end of the throuple.

16:31.542 --> 16:34.076
We're gonna have to fence for her hand.

16:34.178 --> 16:35.644
So, foil, saber, or épée?

16:35.746 --> 16:36.912
A what?

16:36.981 --> 16:38.447
- No, Clive, no...
- Types of swords.

16:38.516 --> 16:40.883
I get it. Listen.
I don't have a tingle, okay?

16:40.951 --> 16:43.154
I haven't had a tingle
for Eileen in a very long time.

16:43.256 --> 16:44.153
[Sighs]

16:44.221 --> 16:46.155
I've had more sex with Sheila
in the last two weeks

16:46.223 --> 16:48.490
than I had with Eileen in the
last two years of our marriage.

16:48.559 --> 16:51.093
Then why, with all the women in the
world, did you have to choose <i> her?</i>

16:51.195 --> 16:52.127
I don't know!

16:52.229 --> 16:54.329
I do a lot of things I don't understand.

16:54.398 --> 16:56.331
I can't believe
I agreed to eat your pie.

16:56.433 --> 16:58.200
Oh, come on. You know you loved it.

16:58.302 --> 16:59.735
Maybe you don't hate me
as much as you thought.

16:59.803 --> 17:02.938
Of course I do.
I have hated you since...

17:04.275 --> 17:06.175
Wait. Why do we hate each other, again?

17:06.242 --> 17:07.209
Are you kidding me?

17:07.310 --> 17:09.044
You know exactly why I hate you.

17:09.146 --> 17:10.345
Because you're poor?

17:10.446 --> 17:11.480
No.

17:11.549 --> 17:12.848
Because eight years ago,

17:12.916 --> 17:15.851
we were going for the same spot
in the parking lot at the mall.

17:15.953 --> 17:16.984
I got it,

17:17.087 --> 17:20.756
and when I went inside,
you keyed my minivan.

17:20.858 --> 17:21.957
I didn't do that.

Oh, please.

17:26.363 --> 17:28.063
No, it wasn't her.

17:28.165 --> 17:29.898
I forgot my cellphone,

17:29.967 --> 17:32.067
and I went back out for it
while you were still shopping.

17:32.136 --> 17:33.435
And I remember that day,

studded belt from Hot Topic.

Whoops.

17:39.877 --> 17:41.076
I never told you,

because I knew you'd make me
throw the belt out...

Well, it appears that I owe you
an apology, Sheila DeMars.

All these years
I've disliked you for no reason.

'cause when you stole
that parking space,

I did a ton of nasty stuff to you.

You're kidding.

Hey, Shannon, I'm sorry

18:08.005 --> 18:09.871

18:09.940 --> 18:10.839
That's okay.

Hmm.

Yeah, I guess in <i> your</i> case,
it's also "bros,"

a little confusing.

18:32.096 --> 18:33.395
