WEBVTT

00:54.255 --> 00:57.019
- Do you mind?
- Go ahead.

01:00.561 --> 01:02.051
You in town for business?

01:02.663 --> 01:04.654
Something like that.

01:15.075 --> 01:17.202
I'm actually here
to forget about business.

01:19.513 --> 01:21.105
You know,
you should try it sometime.

01:21.348 --> 01:22.713
Maybe I will.

01:25.119 --> 01:26.677
Excuse me.

03:23.237 --> 03:25.671
All right, you ready for this?
Here it comes.

03:26.407 --> 03:29.342
- Oh, uh, Matisse.
- Nope, Munch.

03:33.514 --> 03:35.345
- Van Gogh?
- No, Cezanne.

03:35.516 --> 03:37.143
Wow, you really do suck at this.

03:37.317 --> 03:39.911
- So you wouldn't buy it?
- Absolutely not.

03:41.121 --> 03:43.919
I mean, I don't know
if I would, I mean, it depends,

03:44.124 --> 03:45.887
I guess it depends
kind of on the price.

03:46.059 --> 03:47.993
I mean, yeah, no,
I definitely, I would.

03:48.162 --> 03:49.925
You hazing the new guy,
or is he hazing you?

03:50.130 --> 03:52.655
Haze me, Kensi, please.

03:53.700 --> 03:55.429
- Seurat.
- Monet.

03:55.636 --> 03:58.571
Oh, bing, bing, bing,
Sam proceeds to the bonus round

03:58.739 --> 04:00.639
and Kensi wins the consolation prize

04:00.808 --> 04:04.335
otherwise known
as a steaming bucket of fail.

04:05.579 --> 04:08.639
- What case is this?
- It's not a case, it's Anna Kline.

04:08.816 --> 04:11.546
My best friend from childhood
who's visiting L.A.

04:11.718 --> 04:13.879
Our fathers
were stationed at Camp Lejeune.

04:14.054 --> 04:16.386
We stayed close,
I'm meeting her for lunch today.

04:16.557 --> 04:18.387
Married, 4-year-old son.

04:18.559 --> 04:21.357
- Oh, is she in the art business?
- She thinks I am.

04:21.528 --> 04:23.519
I told her I was a curator at a gallery.

04:23.730 --> 04:24.754
A curator?

04:24.965 --> 04:28.731
Well, I had to choose a cover story,
art galleries are cool.

04:28.936 --> 04:30.927
Glamorous,
filled with sophisticated people.

04:31.171 --> 04:32.263
Who know about art.

04:33.207 --> 04:35.869
I once dated a girl for three months
who thought I was a dentist.

04:36.076 --> 04:39.409
Dr. Deeks, DDS. Then one night we
were at dinner and her filling falls out,

04:39.580 --> 04:42.105
she's sitting across
from me and crying out in pain,

04:42.282 --> 04:43.408
begging for me to help.

04:43.617 --> 04:46.108
- What'd you do?
- Ordered shots of 151 proof rum.

04:46.286 --> 04:48.049
Told her to soak it
and kill all the germs.

04:48.222 --> 04:53.057
Soon she couldn't even feel her face,
let alone her tooth. It was hilarious.

04:55.062 --> 04:57.758
You know,
everyone in our line of work

04:57.931 --> 05:01.298
has this regrettable,
necessary choice.

05:01.468 --> 05:05.131
Either be a hermit
or be a cover story.

05:05.339 --> 05:08.206
Hetty, cover story is just
a more dignified way of saying lie.

05:08.375 --> 05:10.468
I am lying to my friend.

05:10.711 --> 05:15.114
Well, sometimes it's better
to just leave the lie in place.

05:15.315 --> 05:21.345
If a loved one really cares about you,
the lie won't matter.

05:21.588 --> 05:24.022
Are you speaking
from experience, Hetty?

05:24.224 --> 05:30.220
It's amazing how much one can learn
from field manuals, Mr. Callen.

05:31.732 --> 05:33.996
Ladies and gentlemen,
it's that time again.

05:34.167 --> 05:36.965
You may wanna cancel
any impending lunch plans.

05:38.672 --> 05:40.367
- Anyone heard from Nate?
- Nope.

05:40.607 --> 05:42.632
Not a call, not even an e-mail.

05:42.809 --> 05:45.369
We don't even know where he is.

05:48.949 --> 05:50.780
What do you have for us, Eric?

05:50.951 --> 05:53.181
The anatomy of a perfect hit.

05:54.821 --> 05:58.689
Cyprus. Meet Special Agent
Dan Williams, NCIS.

05:58.892 --> 06:00.450
Yesterday
he was meeting a contact.

06:00.627 --> 06:02.390
He was aware
that he was being watched.

06:02.629 --> 06:04.893
His tradecraft is good.

06:05.065 --> 06:07.363
He spotted
all security cameras and exits.

06:07.568 --> 06:08.865
He's keeping eye on the crowd.

06:09.469 --> 06:10.959
She's running interference.

06:11.171 --> 06:12.331
But for whom?

06:12.539 --> 06:15.201
This guy,
upstairs in Williams' room.

06:15.375 --> 06:18.572
Williams is focused on threats
in the lounge but not upstairs.

06:20.013 --> 06:21.810
Flirty lady's keeping him busy.

06:21.982 --> 06:23.677
And she's staying anonymous too.

06:23.884 --> 06:25.545
The shape of her hair
is hiding her face

06:25.719 --> 06:27.687
from the cameras in the lounge.

06:27.854 --> 06:31.483
Just like that sheik's keffiyeh,
obscuring his face from the camera.

06:31.658 --> 06:33.421
The cocktail waitress
is only serving people

06:33.594 --> 06:35.186
who are head-on to the cameras.

06:35.696 --> 06:37.561
All we can see
is the back of her head.

06:38.665 --> 06:40.929
Hats look natural with the outfits.

06:41.168 --> 06:42.658
No ID possible.

06:43.303 --> 06:45.999
Oh, right there, what was that?

06:46.173 --> 06:50.234
He sent a file from his PDA
to the NCIS cloud before he got killed.

06:50.410 --> 06:52.537
Unfortunately it got corrupted.

06:52.746 --> 06:55.078
That sporty couple,
tipping off the guy in the room.

06:55.315 --> 06:58.409
Agent Williams was killed
by an injection of succinylcholine.

06:58.585 --> 07:00.610
It causes instant cardiac arrest.

07:00.854 --> 07:03.687
Made it look like he died of natural
causes upon first examination.

07:03.890 --> 07:05.016
Twenty minutes ago

07:05.192 --> 07:09.219
a man used a Canadian passport
to enter LAX from London.

07:09.429 --> 07:14.196
INS photo caught 18 points
of interest, 16 of which match,

07:14.368 --> 07:16.632
Jon White, it's an alias.

07:16.870 --> 07:19.361
- Well, where is he now?
- Being detained by Customs at LAX.

07:19.539 --> 07:23.066
He's been told it's a routine search.
They're waiting for us.

07:23.276 --> 07:26.211
Arrest him, he may not talk.
Could be in town for something bigger.

07:26.380 --> 07:27.745
Well, we could take a chance.

07:27.948 --> 07:30.542
Let him go, tail him,
see what he's up to.

07:30.751 --> 07:32.150
Just snatch him later.

07:32.352 --> 07:33.910
It's risky.

07:34.087 --> 07:35.850
He killed one of ours.

07:36.023 --> 07:38.491
And if he's detained, he'll already
suspect he's being gamed.

07:38.725 --> 07:42.593
Yeah, but if he's in town for something
bigger, it might be a risk worth taking.

07:42.763 --> 07:46.096
If he does get away,
it's gonna be on us.

07:49.069 --> 07:51.094
I like a little bit of pressure.

07:51.304 --> 07:54.137
It does make things
more interesting.

07:56.410 --> 07:59.436
I want you two to cover
the other end of the case.

07:59.613 --> 08:04.380
Agent Williams was investigating
a rebel group in Chechnya.

08:04.551 --> 08:07.145
He suspected
they were buying small arms

08:07.320 --> 08:09.652
from a corrupt source
inside the Navy.

08:10.157 --> 08:13.149
And how far away are we from fixing
that file Williams sent from his PDA?

08:13.393 --> 08:16.453
Uh, we're moving slowly but surely.

08:16.630 --> 08:17.824
It's 13 percent complete.

08:17.998 --> 08:21.764
Welcome
to Los Angeles International Airport.

08:23.403 --> 08:26.429
Dentist, gallery curator.

08:26.640 --> 08:30.337
Point of a cover story is to simplify
your life, not make it harder.

08:30.510 --> 08:34.707
This is the man who once posed
as a sommelier for an entire year.

08:34.914 --> 08:38.510
I've got my vintages, varietals
and appellations down pat.

08:38.684 --> 08:39.777
How could I forget?

08:40.287 --> 08:44.417
Merlot, Bordeaux, Pinot.

08:46.193 --> 08:48.058
You bought a gold pin.

08:48.228 --> 08:49.354
And you wore it.

08:51.331 --> 08:52.798
It was my day-to-day cover story.

08:52.966 --> 08:54.991
And I earned that pin, I didn't buy it.

08:55.168 --> 08:57.068
I took classes and I graduated.

08:57.304 --> 09:00.239
I went all out to develop my palate.

09:00.440 --> 09:03.136
You wore a pin
shaped like a corkscrew.

09:03.310 --> 09:05.642
- For a year.
- You were a magician once.

09:05.846 --> 09:07.746
Not magician, illusionist.

09:07.981 --> 09:09.312
You bought a white rabbit, G.

09:09.483 --> 09:12.850
He came with the hat. There he is.

09:14.821 --> 09:16.652
Here we go.

09:22.462 --> 09:24.089
Taxi.

09:38.378 --> 09:40.539
He's going around the block again.

09:41.114 --> 09:42.843
Something's not right.

09:43.049 --> 09:45.279
The cabby's taking him in circles.

09:45.485 --> 09:46.975
He's not taking him to a meet.

09:47.154 --> 09:49.247
This is the meet.
He knows the cab driver.

09:51.925 --> 09:53.790
It's going down
right now in front of us.

10:12.612 --> 10:15.080
- He's stopping.
- No, he's not.

10:17.384 --> 10:19.249
I knew I should've drove.

10:19.953 --> 10:21.420
Federal agent, stop.

11:04.965 --> 11:06.694
Don't move.

11:06.867 --> 11:09.131
Don't move.

11:20.680 --> 11:21.806
Hey, what's going on?

11:22.015 --> 11:23.778
Federal agent, stay back.

11:47.040 --> 11:48.337
We got nothing.

11:53.012 --> 11:54.445
It was a gypsy cab, Kensi.

11:54.681 --> 11:56.740
Fake medallion number, fake plates.

11:56.916 --> 12:00.352
Driver's in the wind. I didn't get a good
enough look to even give a description.

12:00.520 --> 12:01.544
Move.

12:01.721 --> 12:03.882
Well, have Eric
keep checking for cameras.

12:05.091 --> 12:06.922
Yeah,
we're headed to the boat house.

12:07.827 --> 12:10.125
- Lost him?
- For now.

12:10.330 --> 12:12.389
Can't you pull him out of your hat?

12:14.634 --> 12:17.034
Williams was investigating
a rebel group in Chechnya

12:17.203 --> 12:18.693
called the Grozny Emirate.

12:18.872 --> 12:22.433
Islamic radicals with ties to Al-Qaeda,
founded nine years ago by Vakar.

12:22.942 --> 12:24.432
No known last name.

12:24.611 --> 12:26.272
- Just Vakar?
- One name.

12:26.479 --> 12:30.540
Grand tradition
of Cher, Madonna, Bono.

12:30.750 --> 12:32.630
Ah, great, and this
is the best image we've got.

12:32.785 --> 12:34.514
Well, planning
subway bombings in Moscow

12:34.687 --> 12:36.367
probably isn't
a photo-friendly occupation.

12:36.890 --> 12:40.485
Or a safe one, Vakar was killed
by Russian forces seven years ago.

12:41.494 --> 12:43.121
Well, hiring a hit squad
of this caliber

12:43.296 --> 12:45.355
to take out
an American agent isn't cheap.

12:45.565 --> 12:49.558
Williams' file says the Grozny Emirate
only has $5 million in liquid assets.

12:49.736 --> 12:51.795
Something doesn't track,
they can't afford it.

12:51.971 --> 12:54.906
The money or the spotlight
that comes with killing an NCIS agent.

12:56.910 --> 12:59.140
Unless it was personal.

13:02.015 --> 13:03.676
Jon Craig.

13:03.883 --> 13:07.512
British citizen,
former SAS out of Credenhill.

13:07.687 --> 13:09.746
So, Jon, throwing away
20 years of service

13:09.923 --> 13:11.288
to become a killer for hire.

13:11.457 --> 13:13.322
I'm curious.

13:13.493 --> 13:15.893
- My pension didn't hold my interest.
- Heh.

13:16.963 --> 13:20.023
My pension wasn't great either,
but I got hobbies.

13:20.500 --> 13:21.967
And a gold corkscrew pin.

13:23.670 --> 13:25.331
Don't ask.

13:26.172 --> 13:27.696
I'm a professional.

13:27.907 --> 13:29.772
Either charge me or release me.

13:29.976 --> 13:31.637
Actually, there's a third option.

13:31.844 --> 13:34.005
Because you're a foreign national
and you're a suspect

13:34.180 --> 13:38.014
in the murder of a federal agent, you're
classified as an enemy combatant.

13:38.218 --> 13:40.413
Do you know what that means, Jon?

13:41.221 --> 13:43.985
It means you play ball with us
or we ship your ass off to prison

13:44.157 --> 13:46.352
in an undisclosed location
with a whole lot of sand

13:46.526 --> 13:49.518
and very little regard
for human rights.

13:50.163 --> 13:51.960
Is that professional enough for you?

13:56.736 --> 13:58.431
What sort of deal are you offering?

14:01.374 --> 14:04.571
Gentlemen, someone in this city
is going to die very soon

14:04.744 --> 14:06.871
unless you give me
an incentive to help.

14:07.981 --> 14:11.075
We can re-route your prison flight
from Tunisia to Florida.

14:11.317 --> 14:12.716
I would take that.

14:12.885 --> 14:14.716
If you think
Tunisian prison cuisine sucks,

14:14.887 --> 14:18.687
well, believe me,
the lack of plumbing is even worse.

14:23.730 --> 14:25.391
I'm in Los Angeles for a hit.

14:26.866 --> 14:29.835
My team has been hired to complete
a lethal action on a local target.

14:30.003 --> 14:32.198
- Who's the target?
- I don't know.

14:32.405 --> 14:33.895
- Who hired you?
- I don't know.

14:34.073 --> 14:35.904
I get my fee via wire transfer.

14:37.076 --> 14:40.534
Look, we're a team,
same as you, with security protocols.

14:40.747 --> 14:42.772
We don't know the name
of the target or location

14:42.982 --> 14:45.473
until we check in
at a predetermined rally point.

14:45.685 --> 14:47.482
Who was driving the taxi?

14:47.654 --> 14:48.848
My contact.

14:49.422 --> 14:51.219
That's all I know about the hit.

14:52.091 --> 14:54.355
With you off the board,
there is no hit anymore, right?

14:54.861 --> 14:56.351
Wrong.

14:56.896 --> 14:59.626
Each of us has a backup in place.

14:59.866 --> 15:02.198
In case this exact scenario
should occur.

15:03.002 --> 15:05.994
If I don't turn up to do the job,
then my backup does.

15:07.240 --> 15:09.765
If he doesn't hear from me
within the next hour

15:10.877 --> 15:11.901
he goes in.

15:13.046 --> 15:16.038
Has your backup met
the rest of the team members?

15:17.283 --> 15:18.773
No.

15:20.219 --> 15:23.882
You wanna pose as Craig's
backup, walk into the squad's rally point

15:24.057 --> 15:26.617
and tell them Craig didn't check in,
and you're stepping up.

15:26.793 --> 15:29.728
When they take me through the plan
we'll have the name and location.

15:29.896 --> 15:30.954
I stay with the hit squad,

15:31.130 --> 15:33.758
you get a tactical team
into position at the kill point.

15:33.966 --> 15:35.900
You move in when the hit happens

15:36.102 --> 15:37.592
and we take these guys out.

15:39.272 --> 15:41.672
Well, Craig is the only one
we positively ID'd in Cyprus

15:41.841 --> 15:44.742
which means we can't arrest them
until right before the hit goes down.

15:44.911 --> 15:47.641
Catch them red-handed
while they're already on high alert.

15:48.614 --> 15:51.310
This is a dangerous op
we're talking about.

15:52.952 --> 15:55.750
I know this is the only way,
but it doesn't mean I gotta like it.

16:00.593 --> 16:02.584
Call your backup,
tell him everything's fine.

16:04.997 --> 16:07.557
You're gonna tell me
everything there is to know about him.

16:07.734 --> 16:09.214
These are highly trained individuals.

16:09.836 --> 16:12.270
Former military and intelligence.

16:12.472 --> 16:14.963
- You won't last five minutes.
- That's my problem.

16:15.141 --> 16:16.438
I appreciate your concern, Jon.

16:16.642 --> 16:20.169
Just make the call.
This time I'm driving.

16:21.581 --> 16:23.981
His name's Nathan Wilson.

16:32.959 --> 16:34.722
Take me through your cover story.

16:34.961 --> 16:37.657
I'm Nathan Wilson,
former Green Beret,

16:37.830 --> 16:40.492
buddy of Jon Craig's from our
contracting days in the Green Zone.

16:41.534 --> 16:42.865
I'm good to go.

16:43.870 --> 16:45.963
My button mic is up and running.

16:46.172 --> 16:47.833
I'll be here with Kensi and Deeks.

16:48.040 --> 16:51.203
We hear the distress word,
we'll be inside in less than 60 seconds.

16:51.377 --> 16:54.710
And the distress word
is abracadabra.

17:23.709 --> 17:25.233
Which one of you is Thierry?

17:29.148 --> 17:30.513
I'm Nathan Wilson.

17:33.386 --> 17:35.149
I don't know you.

17:36.389 --> 17:38.357
Jon Craig missed his check-in call.

17:41.427 --> 17:43.395
Why wouldn't Jon check in?

17:43.963 --> 17:47.524
I don't ask questions,
I just stick to the plan.

17:49.302 --> 17:52.863
- He's clean.
- I find this all very interesting.

17:53.039 --> 17:56.202
- Why is that?
- Because I'm Nathan Wilson.

18:08.520 --> 18:11.148
- Did Jon Craig give us wrong intel?
- We gotta move in now.

18:11.356 --> 18:13.153
Not yet,
he didn't say the distress word.

18:13.792 --> 18:15.817
I know my partner.

18:16.428 --> 18:18.896
Okay, so tell me,
who the hell is this guy?

18:19.098 --> 18:21.498
Thierry, I know we haven't met,

18:21.667 --> 18:24.158
but this guy has gotta be a cop.
Jon is a professional.

18:24.369 --> 18:26.569
If he doesn't check in,
it's because he's been arrested.

18:26.805 --> 18:29.205
And he gave up this location
and my name.

18:29.374 --> 18:31.239
I don't know why.

18:31.677 --> 18:33.167
I don't know
who the hell this guy is,

18:33.345 --> 18:35.677
I hope you haven't given him
any information on the target

18:35.848 --> 18:37.042
because this guy's a cop.

18:37.216 --> 18:39.207
This guy's the cop.
He's covering his own ass.

18:39.384 --> 18:41.818
And he's outraged
and counter-accusing.

18:42.020 --> 18:44.580
Standard police protocol
when your cover's being blown.

18:44.823 --> 18:49.453
I heard all about it from a fed that Jon
and I worked with in the Green Zone.

18:50.829 --> 18:53.229
You both have ten seconds
to sort this thing out.

18:53.432 --> 18:54.865
The loser dies.

18:55.067 --> 18:56.432
- Ten.
- Go.

18:56.969 --> 18:58.527
Nine.

18:59.071 --> 19:00.561
Eight.

19:01.340 --> 19:02.967
Seven.

19:03.408 --> 19:04.602
Six.

19:05.844 --> 19:07.277
Five.

19:08.046 --> 19:09.070
Four.

19:09.982 --> 19:11.847
Three.

19:12.651 --> 19:14.346
Two.

19:14.853 --> 19:16.286
Heh, I'm impressed.

19:16.488 --> 19:19.082
Jon would've needed
a new pair of skiwies.

19:19.291 --> 19:20.986
Welcome to the team, Nathan.

19:21.226 --> 19:23.456
It was a test.

19:26.265 --> 19:28.290
You passed. Heh.

19:31.436 --> 19:34.166
The target's name is Emma Mastin.

19:34.373 --> 19:37.103
- Location?
- Sherman Oaks.

19:37.309 --> 19:39.368
Eric, I need everything
on Emma Mastin.

19:39.578 --> 19:41.671
She lives in Sherman Oaks.

19:43.248 --> 19:47.184
Emma Mastin, 29 years old,
no criminal record.

19:47.386 --> 19:49.946
Looks like she's
a stay-at-home mom.

19:50.522 --> 19:54.458
Perfect credit, normal balances
in all of her accounts,

19:54.626 --> 19:58.790
married to Clay Mastin
who also checks out.

19:58.997 --> 20:00.658
No criminal record.

20:00.899 --> 20:02.093
Both clean.

20:02.968 --> 20:05.994
Why hire a pro hit squad
to take out a soft target like her?

20:06.205 --> 20:08.196
They're gonna whack
some lady in the suburbs?

20:09.641 --> 20:10.665
I'll watch G's back.

20:10.842 --> 20:14.403
You two pay Emma Mastin a visit,
see what you can dig up on her.

20:14.580 --> 20:18.141
And keep your cover story simple,
"Dr. Deeks."

20:18.317 --> 20:20.683
Eric, we're gonna need help
getting in the front door.

20:20.919 --> 20:22.181
I'm on it.

20:22.688 --> 20:27.216
Initial surveillance indicates the target
goes to this Fields Market on Moorpark

20:27.426 --> 20:29.326
every Tuesday at 4 p.m.

20:29.828 --> 20:31.659
How long
was the initial surveillance period?

20:31.863 --> 20:34.024
Four weeks. Our intel is solid.

20:35.167 --> 20:37.226
Tradecraft is a dying art.

20:37.436 --> 20:39.700
Nice to see someone
pays attention to the details.

20:39.871 --> 20:41.498
Well, welcome to the A-Team.

20:41.673 --> 20:45.734
We'll be positioned inside the grocery
store when the target enters.

20:45.978 --> 20:50.381
This will be an undercover operation.
We'll be posing as employees.

20:50.582 --> 20:53.745
Why this market? I mean, why not
the parking lot or at her house?

20:53.952 --> 20:55.647
What makes this the ideal location?

20:55.821 --> 20:58.153
I thought you didn't ask questions.

20:58.357 --> 21:02.384
The parking lot is a half
a block from the police station.

21:02.594 --> 21:04.152
Her house has neighbors,

21:04.329 --> 21:07.355
potential witnesses
who may remember anomalies.

21:07.566 --> 21:10.729
And the market has multiple exits.

21:11.036 --> 21:13.869
And access to three different
freeways within, what, half a mile?

21:14.072 --> 21:17.269
And the security camera
blind spot located right here.

21:18.477 --> 21:19.910
We'll make sure she lands on it.

21:20.078 --> 21:23.514
And when she does, you'll strike.

21:25.250 --> 21:29.346
Now, if you miss for any reason,
I'll be there to complete the objective.

21:33.792 --> 21:35.350
- Yes?
- Hetty, it's me.

21:35.527 --> 21:38.257
- What do you have, Sam?
- I've got the hit squad's game plan.

21:38.430 --> 21:40.625
It's going down this afternoon,
I need a tactical team

21:40.799 --> 21:43.597
in position
at the Fields Market on Moorpark.

21:55.380 --> 21:56.813
What do you know about alarms?

21:56.982 --> 21:59.610
Enough. Did two years
L.A.P.D. Robbery Division.

22:00.786 --> 22:03.516
I did an urban counter-surveillance
course at Quantico.

22:03.689 --> 22:04.747
Graduated top of my class.

22:04.923 --> 22:07.756
Well, I guess there's book smart
and then there's street smart.

22:07.926 --> 22:09.518
I'll run point.

22:13.765 --> 22:14.959
I wasn't bragging.

22:15.167 --> 22:17.226
Of course not,
you were just one-upping me.

22:17.436 --> 22:18.460
I'm not a one-upper.

22:18.670 --> 22:22.436
Not normally, somehow just with me.
But, uh, have fun running point.

22:22.641 --> 22:25.075
- Great, have fun watching.
- See, one-upping.

22:25.777 --> 22:27.335
- Hi.
- Hi, Mrs. Mastin?

22:27.546 --> 22:29.036
We're from Live Feed Security.

22:29.247 --> 22:30.908
Oh, what took you guys so long?

22:31.950 --> 22:34.282
I keep turning it off,
but it keeps turning back on.

22:34.486 --> 22:37.114
Let me take a look at the cue pad.

22:38.557 --> 22:40.491
Here we go.

22:40.992 --> 22:45.156
It was a system error. Just needed
to key in the master override code.

22:45.364 --> 22:47.423
Mommy,
the strange man is snooping.

22:47.599 --> 22:50.864
Joshua,
this man is our guest. Be polite.

22:51.069 --> 22:52.627
He made all the noises go away.

22:52.838 --> 22:54.669
What's up, little man? I'm Marty.

22:55.774 --> 22:57.002
Do you play video games?

22:57.175 --> 23:01.509
I do, I do, but I'm actually,
I'm actually working right now, Joshua.

23:01.713 --> 23:03.578
Mommy, can he play?

23:03.782 --> 23:07.377
Well, if it's okay with you, Marty.

23:08.286 --> 23:11.585
Uh, yeah, no, absolutely,
show me the way.

23:11.757 --> 23:13.657
- So how old is he?
- He's 6.

23:13.859 --> 23:15.019
My God, mine's 4.

23:15.193 --> 23:17.184
It all happened so fast,
it blows my mind.

23:17.396 --> 23:19.626
- You're a working mom?
- Yeah.

23:21.199 --> 23:22.666
- May I?
- Sure.

23:23.702 --> 23:25.294
That's my husband, Clay.

23:25.604 --> 23:28.630
Heh. You're awesome at this.
When do I go? You tell me when.

23:29.207 --> 23:32.108
Yeah, like you said,
it feels like things happen so fast.

23:32.277 --> 23:34.108
Right when we started dating,
I got pregnant.

23:34.312 --> 23:36.177
How are you
so much better than me?

23:36.381 --> 23:37.905
But we were in love.

23:38.083 --> 23:40.347
- Took it as a sign, we got married.
- Oh, time's up.

23:40.519 --> 23:41.611
You got me, buddy.

23:41.820 --> 23:44.914
- Beautiful family.
- I'm really lucky to have Clay.

23:48.160 --> 23:50.822
I've actually never heard that language
before, I just had to ask.

23:50.996 --> 23:52.759
What, uh? What is it?

23:52.998 --> 23:54.556
It's Chechen.

24:06.578 --> 24:08.341
There's something
you need to know.

24:08.513 --> 24:10.242
My partner and I are federal agents.

24:10.415 --> 24:11.575
NCIS.

24:13.852 --> 24:14.978
Someone wants you dead.

24:18.923 --> 24:20.390
That doesn't make any sense.

24:25.096 --> 24:27.860
- Please leave my house.
- Emma.

24:28.033 --> 24:30.467
We're not here to arrest you.
We're here to help you.

24:30.635 --> 24:32.364
But to do that,
you have to work with us.

24:33.738 --> 24:35.296
Go.

24:35.473 --> 24:38.931
You're in serious danger.
You and your family.

24:39.144 --> 24:41.305
I need to know the truth
for your family's sake.

24:41.513 --> 24:44.744
Please, be honest with me.

24:48.887 --> 24:53.017
Sometimes it's easier to just leave
the lie in place, isn't it?

25:00.699 --> 25:02.189
Nathan.

25:07.706 --> 25:10.504
Hey, guys, I don't speak, uh, Arabic.

25:10.709 --> 25:12.176
It's not Arabic. It's Farsi.

25:12.410 --> 25:15.140
- No, I don't speak that either.
- The syringe is in the bag.

25:15.346 --> 25:16.608
Don't stick yourself.

25:16.815 --> 25:18.339
- No gun?
- You won't need one.

25:51.483 --> 25:54.577
- Hello?
- Deeks, Vakar's still alive.

25:55.053 --> 25:57.715
Whoa. But the file said he was killed
seven years ago by Russians.

25:57.889 --> 25:59.220
The file was wrong.

25:59.724 --> 26:01.885
Vakar's the one who put the hit out
on Agent Williams.

26:02.060 --> 26:03.527
Now he's got them
after Emma Mastin.

26:20.512 --> 26:22.002
What's up, dude?

26:22.213 --> 26:24.181
Why does Vakar want you dead?

26:26.518 --> 26:28.110
He's alive.

26:28.286 --> 26:29.776
He hired a hit squad.

26:31.389 --> 26:37.123
I have no idea why some Chechen
psycho wants me, of all people, dead.

26:37.295 --> 26:40.230
Emma,
can you stop lying to me, please?

26:40.398 --> 26:41.888
We're here to protect you.

26:43.134 --> 26:45.728
We can only do that if you help us.

27:01.319 --> 27:05.050
Even if you stop this hit squad,
he'll just send another one.

27:06.591 --> 27:08.422
There is a way to end this right now.

27:09.260 --> 27:10.921
Who are you?

27:11.129 --> 27:14.587
Someone who is willing to do anything
to protect her family.

27:15.099 --> 27:16.532
That is not an answer.

27:17.435 --> 27:19.266
Let them come.

27:20.104 --> 27:23.039
- Use me as bait.
- I can't ask you to do that.

27:23.208 --> 27:24.971
I'm in no position to authorize it.

27:25.176 --> 27:28.111
I'm volunteering. I want to do it.

27:28.279 --> 27:29.337
Why, Emma?

27:29.581 --> 27:31.310
Because if Vakar did
send these people,

27:31.482 --> 27:33.143
I need to send a message
back to him.

27:34.185 --> 27:35.482
And what message is that?

27:36.321 --> 27:39.051
It is not gonna be easy.

27:42.427 --> 27:44.657
Talk to your team.

27:45.363 --> 27:46.921
This is your best shot.

28:20.531 --> 28:22.396
- Hello?
- We need to meet.

28:33.811 --> 28:35.244
NCIS must be in real trouble

28:35.413 --> 28:38.211
if the Duchess of Deception
is meeting me in person.

28:38.383 --> 28:42.114
Almost as much trouble
as you were in, in Cape Town.

28:42.754 --> 28:44.221
Cape Town.

28:45.490 --> 28:48.482
Who is Emma Mastin?

28:50.628 --> 28:52.220
I haven't heard that name in a while.

28:54.632 --> 28:57.032
She's a former Shahidka.

28:57.201 --> 28:58.725
That's Chechen for...

28:58.937 --> 29:00.495
Oh, for Black Widow.

29:00.672 --> 29:04.267
Women whose terrorist husbands
are killed in action.

29:06.678 --> 29:09.238
Islamic groups take advantage
of their grief.

29:09.414 --> 29:12.076
Program them
to become suicide bombers.

29:12.250 --> 29:15.549
But she obviously
wasn't a suicide bomber.

29:15.720 --> 29:18.553
Well, she was no run-of-the-mill
grieving widow either.

29:18.723 --> 29:22.420
She started as an operative,
intensive training by ex-KGB.

29:22.593 --> 29:27.257
She's fluent in five languages,
run by Grozny Emirate.

29:28.232 --> 29:29.790
And she was good.

29:29.968 --> 29:33.404
Solid tradecraft. But scary.

29:34.038 --> 29:37.269
Easily as deadly as any of the men.

29:37.475 --> 29:39.568
Pardon my language,
but how the hell did this woman

29:39.744 --> 29:42.235
wind up a housewife
in Sherman Oaks?

29:43.181 --> 29:45.172
Typical Cinderella story.

29:46.484 --> 29:49.578
If Cinderella
was a Chechen assassin.

29:49.787 --> 29:51.118
Callen's in place.

29:51.289 --> 29:54.417
Once Thierry moves in on Emma,
he'll intercept him.

29:54.592 --> 29:56.787
We'll have the squad
for attempted murder.

29:56.961 --> 29:59.259
I'll be with the tactical unit on site.

29:59.430 --> 30:01.830
I still don't feel comfortable
about putting her at risk.

30:02.066 --> 30:04.728
You'll keep a tail on her
outside the market.

30:04.902 --> 30:07.894
Everything goes smoothly,
we'll take this crew down.

30:08.606 --> 30:10.574
Guys,
that file that Special Agent Williams

30:10.742 --> 30:13.302
sent from his PDA,
it's now restored.

30:13.478 --> 30:15.810
I'm sending it to the main screen.

30:16.781 --> 30:21.081
A sonogram. First trimester.

30:21.252 --> 30:24.949
Date indicated
as January 7th, 2004.

30:25.156 --> 30:27.852
The same month Vakar
was supposedly killed.

30:28.092 --> 30:29.719
Looks familiar, doesn't he?

30:30.261 --> 30:31.751
Joshua.

30:32.296 --> 30:34.491
I just spoke to my source.

30:34.665 --> 30:39.659
Evidently, Emma was a former
Grozny Emirate operative.

30:39.871 --> 30:42.669
She thought her husband Vakar
was dead.

30:43.274 --> 30:46.437
Seven years ago
he was seriously wounded

30:46.611 --> 30:49.739
in a raid by Russian forces
and barely survived.

30:49.914 --> 30:52.644
He wanted everyone
to think he'd been killed.

30:52.850 --> 30:55.978
Emma discovered she was carrying
his unborn child, flipped sides.

30:56.187 --> 30:58.849
Agent Williams figured out
that Vakar had a child.

30:59.057 --> 31:00.615
When Vakar knew
what Williams knew,

31:00.792 --> 31:02.350
he hired the hit squad
to take him out.

31:02.527 --> 31:04.327
Now Emma's the only thing
standing between him

31:04.462 --> 31:06.302
and the thing he wants
more than anything else.

31:06.464 --> 31:07.897
His son.

31:27.785 --> 31:31.277
We're waiting on Callen's signal.
He'll give us the green light to move in.

31:31.489 --> 31:33.320
Roger that.

31:49.240 --> 31:50.935
You take care of the employees?

31:51.109 --> 31:53.373
They're tied up in the back.

31:53.945 --> 31:56.106
The syringe is prepped?

31:57.548 --> 31:59.175
- Ready to go.
- Good.

31:59.383 --> 32:01.317
If you lose your opening,
give me the word.

32:01.486 --> 32:03.249
I'll clean up.

32:07.425 --> 32:09.825
All right, thanks.

32:09.994 --> 32:12.622
Protective detail just moved Joshua.
He's secure for now.

32:13.131 --> 32:17.534
If Emma's a former operative,
then she's got situational awareness.

32:23.875 --> 32:25.866
She knew what this was about
from the very start.

32:26.077 --> 32:27.704
That's why she offered herself up.

32:27.879 --> 32:30.245
She's not a soft target,
she just looks like one.

32:30.448 --> 32:33.645
That's why Vakar sent professionals
to take her out.

32:41.459 --> 32:43.222
Thank you.

33:29.974 --> 33:32.943
- Welcome to Fields Market.
- What kind of cheese is this?

33:33.144 --> 33:34.941
It's cheddar.
It's been aged for five years.

33:35.112 --> 33:38.673
- Would you like to try one?
- Maybe another time.

33:54.966 --> 33:58.561
If you like that sauce, you need to try
the new cuts our butcher got today.

33:58.803 --> 34:00.703
- That good?
- Wouldn't steer you wrong.

34:00.938 --> 34:03.566
They're just around the corner.
I'd be happy to show you.

34:09.146 --> 34:12.172
Just go right in the next aisle.
She'll be out in just a moment.

34:12.350 --> 34:13.647
Okay. Thank you.

34:25.396 --> 34:26.522
She's in the blind spot.

34:26.731 --> 34:28.891
Callen's about to tell Thierry
the syringe is jammed.

34:29.065 --> 34:31.261
- Get ready to move in.
- Got it.

34:32.603 --> 34:37.597
Thierry, the syringe malfunctioned.
Time to step up.

34:38.476 --> 34:39.773
Move on my command.

35:35.766 --> 35:37.757
Sam, I don't see Thierry anywhere.

35:38.336 --> 35:41.396
Do not move in.
I repeat, do not move in.

35:41.572 --> 35:44.063
Something's up.
Thierry's changing up his plan.

35:44.275 --> 35:45.833
Thank you.

36:01.859 --> 36:03.451
This woman's good.

36:04.562 --> 36:06.154
She's maintaining her cover.

36:06.330 --> 36:08.924
Knows the hit squad's
still watching her.

36:13.704 --> 36:15.695
Thanks a lot, buddy.

36:17.775 --> 36:19.436
Thierry's gone, Sam.

36:20.378 --> 36:22.175
I don't have him either, G.

36:32.623 --> 36:34.614
Damn it. Move in now.

36:34.825 --> 36:36.349
Let's go. Move in, move in.

36:56.414 --> 36:58.382
Federal agents.

36:59.650 --> 37:01.208
Federal agent. Nice try.

37:01.385 --> 37:03.182
Likewise.

37:05.723 --> 37:07.122
Stay down.

37:08.159 --> 37:09.319
This team's a decoy.

37:10.528 --> 37:13.656
- Who has got eyes on Emma?
- Kensi and Deeks.

37:15.533 --> 37:16.727
She'll be heading home.

37:29.713 --> 37:31.442
Keep it coming.

37:31.649 --> 37:33.412
Good.

37:33.584 --> 37:35.415
Keep it coming.

37:36.253 --> 37:37.914
A little more.

37:38.722 --> 37:40.417
That's good.

37:45.663 --> 37:46.960
We're blocked off from her.

37:50.534 --> 37:52.525
It's a setup.

37:52.736 --> 37:54.203
- Cover my back.
- Right.

38:12.423 --> 38:13.822
Ready? Go.

38:39.984 --> 38:41.781
Follow me.

39:28.666 --> 39:30.896
Not bad for a magician.

39:32.136 --> 39:34.001
Illusionist.

39:38.475 --> 39:40.272
Okay, great. Thank you.

39:41.645 --> 39:45.581
So Joshua's protective detail
should be here any minute now.

39:45.783 --> 39:48.308
I thought I left that life behind.

39:48.485 --> 39:51.352
From what I saw,
you seem to still be pretty good at it.

39:54.291 --> 39:56.316
My husband's on his way home.

39:56.493 --> 39:57.926
He's gonna want answers.

39:59.096 --> 40:02.361
He raised Joshua
like his own flesh and blood.

40:02.933 --> 40:05.902
I will tell him anything about my past
that he wants to know.

40:06.070 --> 40:08.561
But I can't tell him the truth
about Joshua.

40:09.807 --> 40:13.368
- About his real father, Vakar.
- Emma.

40:13.577 --> 40:17.445
This is one lie
that I need to keep in place, Kensi.

40:18.015 --> 40:22.714
If this man loves you as much
as you love him, it's not gonna matter.

40:22.886 --> 40:26.549
The truth will not pull you apart.
If anything, it's gonna bring you closer.

40:28.826 --> 40:31.351
Emma, what happened?
What's going on?

40:34.198 --> 40:36.098
Who's this?

40:37.201 --> 40:40.329
Thank you for everything.

40:45.342 --> 40:47.435
There's something I need to tell you.

40:55.919 --> 40:58.046
So Emma and her family
got their happy ending.

40:58.222 --> 41:02.158
New names, new locations
and brand spanking new cover stories.

41:02.393 --> 41:04.293
There's still one loose end.

41:06.296 --> 41:07.729
You guys had an audience today.

41:19.510 --> 41:20.568
Vakar.

41:22.680 --> 41:24.443
He was there.

41:52.843 --> 41:54.538
How did it go with your friend?

41:54.778 --> 41:57.303
I blew it. That's how it went.

42:00.551 --> 42:03.850
Felt like Anna saw
straight through my cover story.

42:07.357 --> 42:09.325
It gets easier, right?

42:10.828 --> 42:11.920
Yes.

42:13.697 --> 42:15.688
You're lying.

42:15.933 --> 42:17.525
Am I?

42:19.737 --> 42:21.034
Good night, Hetty.

43:19.263 --> 43:22.232
Oh, Sylvia.
