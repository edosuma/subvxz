[Freddie crying]

00:02.919 --> 00:06.131
Jesus Christ!
What do you want?

00:06.172 --> 00:07.716
Man, I've had, like,
two hours of sleep

00:07.757 --> 00:09.175
in the last six months.

00:09.217 --> 00:10.635
You want me to tell you
what happened last week

00:10.677 --> 00:11.803
on  Shameless?

00:11.845 --> 00:15.098
I don't even remember
my own name, for Christ's sake.

00:15.140 --> 00:16.516
Get out of here.

00:16.933 --> 00:19.019
[Carl]  Hey, was waffling
an admission of guilt

00:19.060 --> 00:20.854
out of that guy
without a lawyer present

00:20.895 --> 00:21.980
ethical or whatever?

00:22.022 --> 00:24.149
Our job isn't law or ethics.
It's justice.

00:24.190 --> 00:25.608
That guy was running away
from the cops,

00:25.650 --> 00:27.652
and he admitted guilt--
end of story.

00:27.694 --> 00:29.779
So I was thinking I'm gonna
change out the windows,

00:29.821 --> 00:32.282
and, uh, I was actually
gonna replace 'em

00:32.323 --> 00:34.075
with double glaze, anyway.

00:34.117 --> 00:36.244
Ugh, we gotta stop
hemorrhaging money.

00:36.286 --> 00:38.955
I gotta get a picture
for Little Miss South Side.

00:38.997 --> 00:41.124
Oh, look how beautiful you are.

00:41.166 --> 00:43.501
My girls
have Little Miss South Side

00:43.543 --> 00:45.462
written all over their faces.

00:45.503 --> 00:46.546
[robber]
You got a boner?

00:46.588 --> 00:47.964
No, that's my money roll.

00:48.006 --> 00:50.175
-Can we have it?
-Hmm?

00:50.216 --> 00:51.051
[gun cocking]

00:51.092 --> 00:52.719
-Uh...
-[Mickey]  You two need

00:52.761 --> 00:54.054
to pay someone security
for your daily cash run.

00:54.095 --> 00:56.556
So pay me 25 percent
of your gross profits,

00:56.598 --> 00:57.724
I'll do it for you.

00:57.766 --> 01:00.518
Security and armed transport
from the bar to the bank.

01:00.560 --> 01:01.895
I think we should do it.

01:01.936 --> 01:03.354
[Wyatt] How about
don't be a little bitch,

01:03.396 --> 01:05.190
and you get to keep your job?

01:07.025 --> 01:09.360
I'm not anybody's  bitch.

01:09.402 --> 01:12.238
[cheers and applause]

01:17.535 --> 01:20.538
rock music

01:24.209 --> 01:27.295
Think of all
the luck you got

01:27.337 --> 01:30.715
Know that
it's not for naught

01:30.757 --> 01:33.802
You were beaming
once before

01:33.843 --> 01:38.139
But it's not like that
anymore

01:38.181 --> 01:41.684
What is this downside

01:41.726 --> 01:45.021
That you speak of?

01:45.063 --> 01:47.065
What is this feeling

01:47.107 --> 01:52.237
You're so sure of?

01:58.326 --> 02:02.080
Round up
the friends you got

02:02.122 --> 02:04.999
Know that
they're not for naught

02:05.041 --> 02:08.128
You were willing
once before

02:08.169 --> 02:12.799
But it's not like that
anymore

02:12.841 --> 02:15.927
What is this downside

02:15.969 --> 02:19.514
That you speak of?

02:19.556 --> 02:21.641
What is this feeling

02:21.683 --> 02:25.645
You're so sure of?

02:26.813 --> 02:30.150
[birds chirping]

02:31.776 --> 02:34.070
[engine rumbling]

02:34.112 --> 02:36.281
[person]  Hey, come on!

02:36.322 --> 02:38.867

[Terry groans]

02:58.428 --> 02:59.721
Hey, look.

02:59.762 --> 03:02.015
Our new neighbors
came to welcome us,

03:02.056 --> 03:05.143
even my pansy former son
and his stink-dick boyfriend.

03:05.185 --> 03:07.520
I guess the city must've
made good on their threat

03:07.562 --> 03:08.646
to condemn our old house.

03:08.688 --> 03:10.190
That or the meth lab
caught fire again.

03:10.231 --> 03:12.025
Well, what are they
doing here, though?

03:12.066 --> 03:13.526
Terry's been banging the lady
who owns this place

03:13.568 --> 03:14.819
for a couple of years.

03:14.861 --> 03:16.529
Calls it his plan B.

03:16.571 --> 03:17.989
Mrs. McCurdy?
She's, like, 90.

03:18.031 --> 03:19.490
Gotta do
what you gotta do, man.

03:19.532 --> 03:21.367
-Ugh.
-What's that smell?

03:21.409 --> 03:23.995
[Frank] That's the stench
of abject poverty, son.

03:24.037 --> 03:26.080
Sickening, isn't it?

03:26.122 --> 03:27.749
Actually, I think it might
be those chickens.

03:27.790 --> 03:28.958
[Mickey] Oh, no,
those ain't chickens.

03:29.000 --> 03:31.586
Those are cocks.
Like, for cockfighting?

03:31.628 --> 03:34.339
-Fighting chickens?
-They like it.

03:34.380 --> 03:35.340
If they don't die.

03:35.381 --> 03:37.675
It's natural for 'em.
You know, it's fun.

03:37.717 --> 03:38.801
We have to move.

03:38.843 --> 03:39.886
I don't wanna be the reason

03:39.928 --> 03:41.804
for the next
Black Lives Matter march.

03:41.846 --> 03:45.058
I'll get Trayvon Martin-ed
for sure if we stay here.

03:45.099 --> 03:47.602
-[gunshots]
-[Debbie] Jesus!

03:50.313 --> 03:52.649
[laughing]

03:52.982 --> 03:54.567
-[person] Ow!
-[Ian] Why's he shooting

03:54.609 --> 03:56.110
-random shit?
-[laughs] Aw...

03:56.152 --> 03:58.238
He's playing
"I Spy, You Shoot."

03:58.988 --> 04:00.073
"I Spy, You Shoot"?

04:00.114 --> 04:01.366
It's a kids' game.

04:01.407 --> 04:04.661
Yeah, kid says,
"I spy with my little eye

04:04.702 --> 04:05.912
that red stop sign,"
or whatever,

04:05.954 --> 04:07.789
and then the adult...

04:07.830 --> 04:09.791
shoots the stop sign.

04:10.708 --> 04:12.085
Get off your fucking
high horses.

04:12.126 --> 04:13.586
Anybody here feel like
they're the product

04:13.628 --> 04:15.713
of good parenting,
raise your hand.

04:15.755 --> 04:17.090
Okay, I don't have time
for this shit.

04:17.131 --> 04:19.384
I gotta get Franny ready.

04:19.425 --> 04:20.885
Where is Franny?

04:20.927 --> 04:24.138
[Terry] Fuck it, just dump
the used motor oil in the yard.

04:28.768 --> 04:29.811
[Carl] So I was thinking
we could go check out

04:29.852 --> 04:30.979
that street racing club

04:31.020 --> 04:32.230
at the abandoned
over on Fulton.

04:32.272 --> 04:34.148
Maybe get into
a high-speed car chase.

04:34.190 --> 04:36.109
Ooh, maybe we could
stake out the First Federal,

04:36.150 --> 04:37.944
stop a bank robbery
in progress.

04:37.986 --> 04:39.737
Or we can infiltrate
the Mafia,

04:39.779 --> 04:41.864
take down the Bajio Family
from the inside.

04:41.906 --> 04:43.992
Or we down a couple
of these bad boys,

04:44.033 --> 04:45.785
do all of the above.

04:45.827 --> 04:47.495
Hey.

04:47.537 --> 04:49.622
You know, I'm starting
to like you, Gallagher.

04:49.664 --> 04:51.207
Most rooks can't hang,

04:51.249 --> 04:53.042
but it's like
police work is sex

04:53.084 --> 04:55.003
and you've been poppin' Viagra
all day.

04:55.044 --> 04:56.921
You hard right now,
aren't you?

04:56.963 --> 04:58.298
I'm very hard right now,
ma'am.

04:58.339 --> 05:00.174
-Fully erect for police work.
-[chuckles]

05:00.216 --> 05:01.801
[dispatch]
Got a 28-05 on Benson

05:01.843 --> 05:03.344
in front of the La Chiquita.

05:03.386 --> 05:04.929
Twenty-eight-oh-five?
What's that?

05:04.971 --> 05:06.764
Assault? Human trafficking?

05:06.806 --> 05:08.099
Shots fired.

05:08.141 --> 05:09.517
It's loitering.

05:12.103 --> 05:13.438
Hit it, Billie.

05:15.523 --> 05:19.068

05:36.502 --> 05:38.296
Oh, my God!

Again with the back splatter?

Backsplash.

05:42.383 --> 05:43.634
[scoffs]

05:44.927 --> 05:46.596
So, um...

05:46.637 --> 05:47.847
any interest in brunch?

05:47.889 --> 05:49.015
[sighs]

05:49.057 --> 05:50.933
Are we brunch people now?

05:50.975 --> 05:52.685
An old teacher of mine
invited us.

05:52.727 --> 05:53.436
[grunts]

05:53.478 --> 05:55.146
You're friends
with an old teacher?

05:55.188 --> 05:57.023
Uh, Mr. Hanisian.

05:57.065 --> 05:59.650
He just moved back
from St. Louis.

05:59.692 --> 06:00.985
I don't know.

06:01.027 --> 06:02.111
Wasting the rest of the morning

06:02.153 --> 06:03.780
eating pastries
with some old dude

06:03.821 --> 06:06.157
who taught you, what,
pre-algebra?

06:06.199 --> 06:09.077
-History? Creative writing?
-Music.

06:09.118 --> 06:10.328
Oh.

06:10.370 --> 06:11.829
Great, maybe he can teach us

06:11.871 --> 06:14.374
how to play "Hot Cross Buns"
on the recorder.

06:15.708 --> 06:17.126
So is that a no?

06:17.168 --> 06:19.379
Brunch is a scam.
You know that, right?

06:19.420 --> 06:21.839
Marketers literally
just made up a fourth meal,

06:21.881 --> 06:23.424
and we're all supposed
to go along with it?

06:23.466 --> 06:25.051
Okay.

06:25.093 --> 06:28.096
Well, he really wanted
to meet you,

06:28.137 --> 06:29.347
but I'll just tell him

06:29.389 --> 06:31.891
that you're
too big of an asshole to come.

06:31.933 --> 06:34.143
Everything you wanted

06:34.185 --> 06:36.312
I gave you it...

06:36.354 --> 06:38.398
Well, that must be our perp.

06:38.439 --> 06:41.067
-[Carl] The loosie lady?
-[Leesie] Know her?

06:41.109 --> 06:43.319
Yeah, she been selling squares
out here forever.

06:43.361 --> 06:46.072
-Is that illegal?
-Gotta have a license.

06:46.114 --> 06:48.408
Look like she has
a license to you?

06:53.913 --> 06:56.124
Hey there, Officer.
Something I can get you?

06:56.165 --> 06:58.000
I got menthol and regular.

06:58.042 --> 06:59.669
Oh, we're not buying.
Uh, we just--

06:59.710 --> 07:00.753

07:00.795 --> 07:02.088
Any relation to Lip?

07:02.130 --> 07:04.382
-Yeah, he's my brother.
-[laughs]

07:04.424 --> 07:06.384
He used to be my best customer.

07:06.426 --> 07:09.303
I haven't seen that handsome
face in a month of Sundays.

07:09.345 --> 07:11.931
-Did he get busted again?
-No, he actually had a baby.

07:11.973 --> 07:14.809
Ugh! Them newborn babies
is bad for business.

07:14.851 --> 07:16.686
-Hey.
-So look, unfortunately--

07:16.727 --> 07:18.771
Y'all still live over there
by the Washingtons?

07:18.813 --> 07:20.356
You know the Washingtons?

Ooh, yeah, we used to--

Fucking move your ass!

07:23.609 --> 07:25.069
I catch you selling
out here again,

07:25.111 --> 07:27.196
I'm busting your ass,
and I'm taking you in.

07:27.238 --> 07:30.700
Okay!
Miss June respects the police.

07:30.741 --> 07:32.702
Yes, she does.

Them blue lives matter.

07:36.914 --> 07:38.666
Especially them blue lives.

07:41.169 --> 07:42.628
I was doing it.

07:42.670 --> 07:43.796
Could've fooled me.

[Harley Quinn on TV]
It's me, dickhead.

07:47.800 --> 07:48.384
Uh, by the way...

07:48.426 --> 07:49.927
Hey, what you doin' today?

07:49.969 --> 07:51.053
[Joker on TV]
"It's me, dickhead,"

07:51.095 --> 07:53.431
or just "me, dickhead"?

07:54.056 --> 07:55.475
Yo...

07:55.516 --> 07:57.101
Ian.

07:57.143 --> 07:58.394
I'm just trying
to find the strength

07:58.436 --> 08:00.271
to get off the couch
and search for another

08:00.313 --> 08:03.024
minimum-wage,
dead-end, soul-crushing job

08:03.065 --> 08:05.109

08:05.151 --> 08:08.529
Yeah, well...
what if I offer you a job?

08:09.822 --> 08:11.991
As what, getaway car driver?

08:12.033 --> 08:14.410
Come on, weed money security
for the Alibi.

08:14.452 --> 08:15.536
It's your lucky day, bitch.

08:15.578 --> 08:18.831
-Come on.
-Yeah, thanks but no, thanks.

08:18.873 --> 08:20.333
Fuck you.
Why not?

08:20.374 --> 08:22.960
I'm not doing anything
illegal.

08:23.002 --> 08:24.045
Weed's legal now.

Look, stop eating your weight
in Froot Loops.

08:26.130 --> 08:27.548
Go get dressed.

08:28.216 --> 08:30.051
Go on.

08:30.635 --> 08:33.304
I don't think it's a good idea
for us to work together.

08:33.346 --> 08:35.223
Oh. Oh, oh.

08:35.264 --> 08:36.390
Well, let's get this shit
straight, then,

08:36.432 --> 08:38.434
'cause it's not
"workin' together."

08:38.476 --> 08:40.645
You're workin' for me,
all right?

08:40.686 --> 08:41.771

First comes crime,

08:54.200 --> 08:56.327
then drugs.

08:56.369 --> 08:58.996
Then they impregnate our women,

08:59.038 --> 09:00.998
take over our schools,

09:01.040 --> 09:04.752
drain and defraud
our public safety nets,

09:04.794 --> 09:05.628
and finally,

09:05.670 --> 09:09.090
the introduction of some
rare, communicable diseases

09:09.131 --> 09:10.716
which they brought from

09:10.758 --> 09:14.136
whatever exotic or savage place
they originally came from.

09:14.178 --> 09:16.764
Weren't they living,
like, five minutes from here?

09:16.806 --> 09:18.808
That's beside the point.

09:18.849 --> 09:20.393
Our pure immune systems

09:20.434 --> 09:23.396
can't handle
a Milkovich virus this close.

09:23.437 --> 09:24.855
It's like living
right next door

09:24.897 --> 09:26.190
to a nuclear waste dump.

09:26.232 --> 09:29.944
Sooner or later,
the radiation's gonna get ya.

09:29.986 --> 09:31.821
This only ends with death.

09:31.862 --> 09:33.864
We're gonna die?
For real?

09:33.906 --> 09:35.950
Odds just shot up considerably.

09:35.992 --> 09:38.286
-[dog barking]
-So we should move.

09:38.327 --> 09:40.246
That's still my vote: move.

09:40.288 --> 09:42.331
We don't cut and run.

09:42.373 --> 09:45.126
That's not the Gallagher way.

09:45.167 --> 09:47.795
We have a history
to defend here.

09:47.837 --> 09:49.672
A culture.

09:49.714 --> 09:51.048
A community.

09:51.090 --> 09:53.175
No, we gotta figure out
how to stop them

09:53.217 --> 09:57.638
before their slimy
poverty tentacles unfurl

09:57.680 --> 09:59.390
and devour everything
on this block.

09:59.432 --> 10:01.559
[Terry] What are you
starin' at, Gallagher?

10:01.601 --> 10:04.854
Uh, just watching
the neighborhood go to shit

10:04.895 --> 10:06.063
in real time.

10:06.105 --> 10:07.189
We're the reason

10:07.231 --> 10:08.941
the neighborhood's
goin' to shit?

10:08.983 --> 10:10.318
You were here first.

10:10.359 --> 10:11.402
What makes the Gallaghers

10:11.444 --> 10:12.653
so much better
than the Milkoviches?

10:12.695 --> 10:16.198
You mean other than, uh,
daily showers

10:16.240 --> 10:18.075
and the lack of swastikas?

10:18.117 --> 10:20.953
It's a long list, Terry.
We'll be here all day.

10:20.995 --> 10:22.622
You think
you're better'n me?

10:22.663 --> 10:25.166
Yes, as a matter of fact,
I do.

10:25.207 --> 10:27.460
I am.
We're all better than you.

10:27.501 --> 10:29.170
The only thing
you're better than

10:29.211 --> 10:31.380
is the blacks and the Mexicans

10:31.422 --> 10:32.757
and the Jews.

10:32.798 --> 10:35.301
Otherwise, you're a grade-F
lowlife like the rest of us.

10:35.343 --> 10:36.844
Take that back.

10:36.886 --> 10:37.970
Fuck no.

10:38.012 --> 10:39.263
I said take that back.

10:39.305 --> 10:41.807
Why don't you come over here
and make me?

10:44.560 --> 10:46.854
You're lucky
my son's here, Terry.

10:46.896 --> 10:47.855
'Cause if I wasn't trying

10:47.897 --> 10:50.983
to set a positive example
for him...

10:51.025 --> 10:52.193
[Terry] Bawk, bawk, bawk, bawk.

10:52.234 --> 10:54.862
Baaaawk, bawk, bawk.
[chuckles]

10:54.904 --> 10:57.531
Drumming Bird's
"Second Best" playing

10:57.573 --> 10:59.742
Don't harass me
if I'm here on time

10:59.784 --> 11:02.328
Another day
on the assembly line...

11:02.370 --> 11:05.164
-Fuck you do to that kid?
-She did it herself.

11:05.206 --> 11:07.541
Thought superglue was hair gel.

11:07.583 --> 11:09.293
[laughs]
Kids are idiots.

11:09.335 --> 11:11.462
-No offense, Franny.
-[Debbie] Her head size?

11:11.504 --> 11:12.922
Uh, small?
Extra-small.

11:12.963 --> 11:16.133
She just turned five,
so whatever your smallest--

11:16.175 --> 11:17.343
Okay. No problem.

11:17.385 --> 11:19.178
-[phone clatters]
-Literally nobody

11:19.220 --> 11:20.680
carries wigs for kids.

11:20.721 --> 11:23.599
How 'bout you just let her
compete with her new do?

11:23.641 --> 11:25.351
This stuff ain't comin' out,

11:25.393 --> 11:27.603
and she actually
looks kind of punk rock.

11:27.645 --> 11:29.397
[Mickey] No way.
That shit looks terrible.

11:29.438 --> 11:30.940
Yeah, that's exactly
what I'm talking about.

11:30.981 --> 11:33.275
I mean, how am I gonna
stand a chance with the judges

11:33.317 --> 11:36.529
if even Mickey can see
that my kid looks like a...

11:36.570 --> 11:39.240
walking, talking
dumpster fire?

11:39.281 --> 11:40.241
No offense, Franny.

11:40.282 --> 11:41.450
You're both
conditioned to think

11:41.492 --> 11:44.078
girls have to look,
like, one way.

11:44.120 --> 11:45.329
Why does Franny
have to conform?

11:45.371 --> 11:47.289
You're just piling
your princess complex on her

11:47.331 --> 11:48.999
'cause of your own childhood.

11:49.041 --> 11:49.875
Break the cycle.

11:49.917 --> 11:50.960
I am totally committed

11:51.001 --> 11:53.671
to tearing down false ideals
of feminine beauty...

11:53.713 --> 11:55.339
after Franny wins
Little Miss South Side.

11:55.381 --> 11:57.174
[Mickey] You guys should
check out the, uh,

11:57.216 --> 11:58.300
children's hospital.

11:58.342 --> 11:59.719
They got all the cancer kids
with the bald heads.

11:59.760 --> 12:01.011
I mean, they gotta have
wigs over there

12:01.053 --> 12:03.347
so they don't scare the other
kids when they go home.

12:03.389 --> 12:05.391
-If they go home.
-That's a great idea, Mickey.

12:05.433 --> 12:07.476
I'm declaring
a Gallagher war.

12:07.518 --> 12:09.395
-Debbie, can I count on you?
-Shh. On the phone.

12:09.437 --> 12:10.604
[Sandy] A war on what?

12:10.646 --> 12:15.192
A war to rid this community
of the Milkovich scourge.

12:15.693 --> 12:18.154
Uh, you realize
I'm a Milkovich, right?

12:18.195 --> 12:20.406
Yeah, me too.

12:20.448 --> 12:21.574
Oh.

12:21.615 --> 12:24.201
Well, some Southerners
fought with the North

12:24.243 --> 12:25.286
against slavery.

12:25.327 --> 12:28.456
You can join our cause
if your heart is true.

12:28.497 --> 12:29.498
Yeah, you're not gonna win.

12:29.540 --> 12:31.751
Milkoviches
are an invasive species.

12:31.792 --> 12:33.669
We don't die.
We multiply.

12:33.711 --> 12:34.795
Come on, you're making
our family sound

12:34.837 --> 12:36.297
way worse
than they actually are.

12:36.338 --> 12:38.382
Didn't your dad
try to kill you?

12:38.424 --> 12:39.383
Whatever.

12:39.425 --> 12:40.593
Look, the point is,
I'm not just gonna

12:40.634 --> 12:41.886
sit here and let you shit-talk
my family.

12:41.927 --> 12:44.889
If you're content to fall
on the wrong side of history,

12:44.930 --> 12:45.848
suit yourself.

12:45.890 --> 12:48.225
Just know that you will
be judged harshly

12:48.267 --> 12:49.935
for years to come.

12:50.519 --> 12:52.646
Debbie!
War?

12:52.688 --> 12:53.647
Saint Brigid's gift shop

12:53.689 --> 12:55.232
carries a whole line
of kids' wigs.

12:55.274 --> 12:56.358
If we leave right now,
we can make it

12:56.400 --> 12:58.235
in time
for Little Miss South Side.

12:58.277 --> 12:59.153
Eee!

12:59.195 --> 13:00.196
[Lip] Mm, you see this?

13:00.237 --> 13:02.072
Two eggs and toast
for 14 bucks?

13:02.114 --> 13:03.407
-Uh-huh.
-It's a total scam.

13:03.449 --> 13:04.575
-Oh, there he is!
-It's crazy.

13:04.617 --> 13:07.495
-Ah! There she is.
-Hi!

13:07.536 --> 13:09.079
-Oh!
-[Tami] Oh!

13:09.121 --> 13:10.915
[Marcos] Oh, my gosh.

13:10.956 --> 13:12.333
[Tami sighs]

13:12.374 --> 13:13.751
Wow.

13:13.793 --> 13:14.960
And this must be
the lucky fella.

13:15.002 --> 13:18.255
Hey, yeah, the famous
Mr., uh, Hanisian, right?

13:18.297 --> 13:19.298
I'm, uh, Lip.

13:19.340 --> 13:21.509
Jesus! "Mr. Hanisian"?
Please.

13:21.550 --> 13:22.802
It's Marcos.

13:22.843 --> 13:26.180
I haven't been Tam-Tam's
teacher for a very long time.

13:26.222 --> 13:27.681
-"Tam-Tam."
-Yes.

13:27.723 --> 13:29.558
It's a long story,
but it has something to do

13:29.600 --> 13:31.894
-with the tragic fate of a--
-The drum!

13:31.936 --> 13:33.479
Oh, my God.

13:33.521 --> 13:35.481
[laughing] The drum!

13:35.523 --> 13:37.858
I totally forgot about that,
but...

13:37.900 --> 13:38.651
My gosh.

13:38.692 --> 13:40.444
Oh, my fiancée
sends her regards.

13:40.486 --> 13:42.112
She was gonna join us,
but she got this call

13:42.154 --> 13:43.447
for a last-second interview.

13:43.489 --> 13:45.282
-Fiancée?
-Yes.

13:45.324 --> 13:46.242
[laughs]

13:46.283 --> 13:48.202
-Congrats!
-Thank you.

13:48.828 --> 13:50.287
Oh, I made the reservation.

13:50.329 --> 13:53.040
Let me just go tell 'em
we're only three.

13:53.082 --> 13:55.793
[Tami sighs, giggles]

13:56.669 --> 13:57.670
[laughs]
Yeah!

13:57.711 --> 14:00.673
upbeat music

14:05.594 --> 14:07.638
Oh, what are you doin'?

14:07.680 --> 14:10.266
-Cleaning my gun.
-Yeah. Why?

14:10.307 --> 14:11.642
Gotta transport cash
for the Alibi.

14:11.684 --> 14:13.644
I thought you said
this job was legal.

14:13.686 --> 14:16.397
-It is.
-Is the gun even registered?

14:16.438 --> 14:18.023
[laughing] Of course not.

14:18.065 --> 14:18.983
You're a convicted felon.

14:19.024 --> 14:20.776
Are you allowed
to have a gun at all?

14:20.818 --> 14:22.570
That's why it's not
registered, dumbass.

14:22.611 --> 14:24.822
Yeah, so weed might be legal,
but carrying a gun

14:24.864 --> 14:27.616
as a convicted felon
is about as illegal as it gets.

14:27.658 --> 14:30.369
What happens
if you get arrested,

14:30.411 --> 14:31.412
get sent back to prison?

14:31.453 --> 14:34.498
Look, I'm doin' security.
Need a gun.

14:34.540 --> 14:36.542
Do you have anything
resembling an imagination

14:36.584 --> 14:38.878
in that fucking skull of yours?

14:40.129 --> 14:41.964
No. I like facts.

14:42.006 --> 14:43.674
Things that are real.
Shit I can hold.

14:43.716 --> 14:44.800
[cartridge clicks, gun cocking]

14:44.842 --> 14:47.219
-Like a gun.
-[gun clicks]

14:49.972 --> 14:52.683
Kev, where's Amy?
Can't be late!

14:52.725 --> 14:53.726
[footsteps]

14:53.767 --> 14:57.897
-She doesn't wanna go.
-What? She's goin'!

14:57.938 --> 15:00.190
I'm sorry you didn't
make the cut for the contest

15:00.232 --> 15:01.108
and Gemma did.

15:01.150 --> 15:03.235
I know how bad you wanna
be standing beside her,

15:03.277 --> 15:04.904
competing for the title,

15:04.945 --> 15:06.280
but it's a cold world,
baby girl,

15:06.322 --> 15:07.281
and it ain't gettin'
much warmer,

15:07.323 --> 15:09.325
so fix your face,
put your mask up,

15:09.366 --> 15:11.035
and get ready to cheer
for your sister.

15:11.076 --> 15:12.953
-[Frank] We got a problem!
-[Kev] Jesus, Frank!

15:12.995 --> 15:14.038
[Veronica]
Where's your mask?

15:14.079 --> 15:15.372
You can't just walk
into our house.

15:15.414 --> 15:16.790
-It's an emergency!
-What happened?

15:16.832 --> 15:20.628
Our community has been
infiltrated by undesirables.

15:20.669 --> 15:22.796
-The Milkoviches.
-[Frank] We gotta ban together

15:22.838 --> 15:24.673
and figure out a way
to drive them back

15:24.715 --> 15:27.301
to the vermin-infested
hellhole they crawled out of.

15:27.343 --> 15:28.636
[Veronica]
I will make them a pie.

15:28.677 --> 15:30.888
It's the best way to win over
problem neighbors,

15:30.930 --> 15:32.389
the good, old-fashioned way.

15:32.431 --> 15:33.682
-Kev, I gotta go.
-[Kev] You know, Frank,

15:33.724 --> 15:35.517
the Milkoviches
might be awful,

15:35.559 --> 15:36.602
but living next to them

15:36.644 --> 15:38.520
can't be much worse
than living next to you.

15:38.562 --> 15:40.314
soft rock music

15:40.356 --> 15:41.774
Uh-huh.

15:44.360 --> 15:45.736
Oh, hell no.

15:47.613 --> 15:48.614
Handle this.

15:50.699 --> 15:51.617
I'm on it.

15:54.495 --> 15:57.039
Take it easy, Paul Bunyan.

15:57.081 --> 16:00.292
Chop you down to size
real quick.

16:03.879 --> 16:05.798
How do we get rid
of these fuckers?

16:07.424 --> 16:08.592
I-I don't know.

16:14.139 --> 16:16.266
Still poutin'
over that loosie lady stop?

16:16.308 --> 16:18.310
No. I'm good.

16:19.061 --> 16:21.689
Could've just shot her.
You know that, right?

16:21.730 --> 16:23.148
-Would've been way quicker.
-Or you could've just

16:23.190 --> 16:25.275
-gave the woman a break.
-That ain't no woman.

16:25.317 --> 16:28.862
Don't you recognize big-dick
energy when you see it?

16:30.155 --> 16:31.657
Look, we are cops.

16:31.699 --> 16:33.867
We stop crime, period.

16:33.909 --> 16:36.036
Fuck all this
community policing shit.

16:36.078 --> 16:38.539
We bust heads.
We arrest people.

16:38.580 --> 16:40.165
That is our job.

16:40.207 --> 16:43.335
Plus, all that jaw-jackin'
you were doin' with that  lady,

16:43.377 --> 16:44.837
you let your guard down.

16:44.878 --> 16:47.381
That's exactly what
some of these mopes want.

16:47.423 --> 16:50.592
Get you comfortable,
get familiar,

16:50.634 --> 16:51.885
get close,

16:51.927 --> 16:54.555
then they take out a blade
and they slice you.

16:54.596 --> 16:57.224
Seen it a thousand times.

16:57.850 --> 16:59.101
I don't think the loosie lady

16:59.143 --> 17:00.561
-would try to cut me.
-[laughs] Oh!

17:00.602 --> 17:02.938
You think that she's made it
out here on these streets

17:02.980 --> 17:05.899
for this long
without cuttin' somebody?

17:06.525 --> 17:08.652
Shi-i-it.

17:08.694 --> 17:11.113
I got a bridge to sell you.

17:11.155 --> 17:13.157
You'll see.

17:14.033 --> 17:15.576
[Debbie] Eventually, we're
gonna have to do something

17:15.617 --> 17:16.910
about your relatives
living next door.

17:16.952 --> 17:18.871
I can't even park my truck
outside anymore.

17:18.912 --> 17:20.164
Oh, yeah,
that's a smart move.

17:20.205 --> 17:22.666
My cousins will break into it
for sure.

17:22.708 --> 17:24.710
I mean, there is one
silver lining, though.

17:24.752 --> 17:26.795
[Sandy chuckles]
What's that?

17:26.837 --> 17:28.422
[Debbie]
Well, you know, now you and I

17:28.464 --> 17:29.715
live right next to each other.

17:29.757 --> 17:32.217
-Hmm?
-Um...

17:32.259 --> 17:34.636
I mean, I don't
live with them anymore.

17:34.678 --> 17:36.013
You don't?

17:36.055 --> 17:38.223
-Then where do you live?
-[Veronica] Debbie?

17:38.265 --> 17:39.850
Hey!

17:39.892 --> 17:41.769
[gasps]
Oh, my gosh.

17:41.810 --> 17:43.228
Look at you, Gemma.

17:43.270 --> 17:46.440
Don't you look pretty?
Where you guys headed?

17:46.482 --> 17:48.192
Little Miss South Side.

17:48.233 --> 17:49.109
Oh!

17:49.151 --> 17:50.778
Franny's a finalist
in Little Miss South Side.

17:50.819 --> 17:53.280
[laughs]
You're kidding.

17:53.322 --> 17:53.989
No.

17:54.031 --> 17:56.617
I-I didn't know you entered.

17:56.658 --> 17:58.035
I didn't know
you entered either.

17:58.077 --> 18:01.371
It's getting hot
in here...

18:01.413 --> 18:03.582
The more, the merrier, right?

18:03.624 --> 18:04.792
Mm-hmm.

18:04.833 --> 18:07.669
A little friendly competition
never hurt anyone.

18:07.711 --> 18:09.713
Exactly.
This'll be fun.

18:09.755 --> 18:11.507
So much fun.

18:11.548 --> 18:12.966
This'll be so much fun.

18:13.008 --> 18:14.176
rock music

18:14.218 --> 18:15.636
Welcome to the lion's den

18:15.677 --> 18:17.638
You want me to replace my gun
with this shit?

18:17.679 --> 18:19.306
No, look.

18:19.348 --> 18:21.767
All you need is your reputation
as a Milkovich

18:21.809 --> 18:23.018
and a little help
looking the part,

18:23.060 --> 18:24.478
and no one will fuck with you.

18:24.520 --> 18:25.604
Uh-huh.

18:25.646 --> 18:27.147
Job's gonna be fuckin' sweet,
man.

18:27.189 --> 18:30.943
I get to transport
drugs and money legally.

18:30.984 --> 18:33.445
-Sky's the limit, bitch.
-Right.

18:34.738 --> 18:36.448
Hey, thought you'd
be happy, man.

18:36.490 --> 18:37.908
I can get us a new place.

18:37.950 --> 18:39.159
Gotta move out of your house

18:39.201 --> 18:40.953
now that my fuckin' dad
moved next door.

18:40.994 --> 18:43.455
Oh, so you admit having
the Milkoviches next door

18:43.497 --> 18:44.665
-is a problem.
-Fuck yeah.

18:44.706 --> 18:46.750
We're loud, violent,
racist homophobes

18:46.792 --> 18:48.168
with serious hygiene issues.

18:48.210 --> 18:49.419
My dad tried
to fuckin' kill us.

18:49.461 --> 18:51.463
I just didn't wanna say that
in front of your family

18:51.505 --> 18:52.756
'cause...fuck 'em.

18:52.798 --> 18:55.509
Gallaghers are only, like, one
small step above Milkoviches

18:55.551 --> 18:57.344
on, like,
the shitty family ladder.

19:07.688 --> 19:08.772
Jesus.

19:08.814 --> 19:11.275
You want me to play fuckin'
dress-up G.I. Joe?

19:11.316 --> 19:12.568
Look the part.

19:12.609 --> 19:13.819
Everyone will think
you're some sort

19:13.861 --> 19:16.613
of special forces
military badass or somethin'.

19:16.655 --> 19:18.115
Yeah, I'm not wearin' that shit

19:18.157 --> 19:20.200
unless you're wearin' it
with me.

19:20.242 --> 19:21.952
No way.

19:21.994 --> 19:23.162
Okay, good.

19:23.203 --> 19:24.872
Take my chances
with my regular clothes

19:24.913 --> 19:26.039
and my real fuckin' gun.

19:26.081 --> 19:28.375
Easier like that anyway.

19:29.585 --> 19:30.878
Mick.

19:30.919 --> 19:33.213
[sighs]
Wait.

19:34.840 --> 19:38.218
[[indistinct chatter]

19:42.514 --> 19:43.974
[Leesie] See? What'd I say?

19:44.016 --> 19:45.642
No dead cop.

19:45.684 --> 19:47.394
Freeze! Police!

19:48.353 --> 19:50.314
Wait. Solo?

19:50.355 --> 19:52.399
White Boy Carl?

19:54.234 --> 19:56.820
[laughs]
That's when all the altos

19:56.862 --> 19:58.363
became the "alt-nos"!

19:58.405 --> 19:59.990
[both laughing]

20:00.032 --> 20:02.492
-[Tami snorts]
-Ooh! [laughs]

20:02.534 --> 20:04.119
[Tami] Oh, my God!

20:04.161 --> 20:06.163
-You're still funny.
-[Marcos] Aw.

20:06.205 --> 20:09.041
And you still do that thing
where you crinkle your nose

20:09.082 --> 20:11.501
-and snort.
-[Tami giggles]

20:14.004 --> 20:16.757
Nature calls.
I'll be right back.

20:16.798 --> 20:18.091
[slaps shoulder]

20:20.636 --> 20:23.013
So...what do you think?

20:23.055 --> 20:25.057
What do I think?
I think, um...

20:25.682 --> 20:27.184
I think he definitely has a...

20:27.226 --> 20:28.560
has a thing for you, right?

20:28.602 --> 20:30.437
mellow music

20:30.479 --> 20:31.730
What?

20:31.772 --> 20:33.982
I mean, yeah, I'm-I'm gettin'
this vibe that...

20:34.024 --> 20:36.610
I don't know, it's weird,
but he's...

20:36.652 --> 20:37.945
he's crushin' on you.

20:37.986 --> 20:38.987
You-you don't see it?

20:39.029 --> 20:41.448
Nope. I mean...

20:41.490 --> 20:42.407
not really.

20:42.449 --> 20:44.243
Don't mean
I'm not worth the heat

20:44.284 --> 20:46.620
You're passing
into section

20:46.662 --> 20:47.788
[Lip] Huh.

20:47.829 --> 20:50.207
Cost collection
of regression...

20:50.249 --> 20:52.918
[Leesie] Okay, some for you

20:52.960 --> 20:55.796
and some more for you

20:55.837 --> 20:59.132
and just enough
to count as a felony for you.

20:59.174 --> 21:00.717
Come on, man.
This some bullshit.

21:00.759 --> 21:01.593
Damn.

21:01.635 --> 21:02.886
-[Carl] Hey, Leesie.
-Hmm?

21:02.928 --> 21:03.971
Can I talk to you for a second?

21:04.012 --> 21:05.555
Yeah.

21:05.597 --> 21:08.392
Down low, baby

21:10.185 --> 21:11.770
What are you doing?

21:11.812 --> 21:13.730
Planting evidence.

21:13.772 --> 21:15.023
Not all of them
were sorting pills.

21:15.065 --> 21:16.316
Some of them
were just sitting there.

21:16.358 --> 21:18.735
-So what are you suggesting?
-Let a few of 'em walk.

21:18.777 --> 21:20.487
Like Solo.
He's actually a good dude.

21:20.529 --> 21:21.530
He's a drug dealer.

21:21.571 --> 21:23.824
There's always gonna be
a drug dealer on this block.

21:23.865 --> 21:25.492
Solo's our best option.

21:25.534 --> 21:26.827
Come on.

21:26.868 --> 21:28.620
He sponsors
a kids' basketball team,

21:28.662 --> 21:30.080
gives out turkeys
on Thanksgiving.

21:30.122 --> 21:32.666
You know who's gonna replace
his spot if he gets locked up?

21:32.708 --> 21:34.668
The cartel.
They cut heads off.

21:34.710 --> 21:35.919
You wanna be back here
in two weeks

21:35.961 --> 21:36.878
matching heads with bodies?

21:36.920 --> 21:38.839
Okay, we need at least two.

21:38.880 --> 21:40.424
You pick.
I'ma take these pills

21:40.465 --> 21:42.592
back to the car,
log 'em in as evidence.

21:42.634 --> 21:44.136
Wait, which two?

21:44.678 --> 21:46.305
I don't give a shit.

21:49.933 --> 21:52.102
[sighs]

21:52.144 --> 21:54.104
Let's spitball.
Rapid fire.

21:54.146 --> 21:56.106
What do you got?
No wrong answers.

21:56.148 --> 21:57.649
How 'bout we all just move?

21:57.691 --> 21:59.985
Wrong answer.
Not an option.

22:00.027 --> 22:01.111
Oh!

22:01.153 --> 22:04.239
How 'bout we just pay someone
to burn down their house?

22:04.281 --> 22:06.825
You know how close
our houses are to theirs?

22:06.867 --> 22:08.535
Might as well just
set ourselves on fire

22:08.577 --> 22:10.078
and cut out the middleman.

22:10.120 --> 22:13.623
Is there any value
in letting loose a bedbug

22:13.665 --> 22:15.876
and-and lice infestation?

22:15.917 --> 22:17.252
Bedbugs and lice
will just spend a week

22:17.294 --> 22:18.837
training at the Milkoviches',

22:18.879 --> 22:20.505
Learning, evolving,

22:20.547 --> 22:21.590
getting strong and shit.

22:21.631 --> 22:24.509
Then they'll attack our houses
with maxed-out abilities.

22:24.551 --> 22:26.970
-We won't stand a chance.
-[Liam] Here's an idea.

22:27.012 --> 22:29.222
We find a new house,

22:29.264 --> 22:30.724
pack up all our stuff,

22:30.766 --> 22:32.517
and take that stuff
to the new house

22:32.559 --> 22:36.188
and live there forever,
away from the racists.

22:38.148 --> 22:41.985
Maybe we're going about this
all wrong.

22:42.027 --> 22:46.073
This is exactly the-the
low-rent line of thinking

22:46.114 --> 22:48.867
we're trying to protect
this neighborhood from.

22:48.909 --> 22:51.328
We need classy solutions.

22:51.370 --> 22:56.416
What would a well-established,
civilized homeowner do?

22:58.919 --> 22:59.961
How should I know?

23:00.003 --> 23:02.214
Start a neighborhood watch.

23:02.255 --> 23:04.758
-A homeowner's association.
-[Kev] Oh, Frank,

23:04.800 --> 23:06.593
that'll take weeks to set up.

23:06.635 --> 23:08.095
We need them out ASAP,

23:08.136 --> 23:10.806
preferably by the time
V gets back.

23:10.847 --> 23:12.849
We need to go right at 'em.

23:12.891 --> 23:15.644
Match their aggression,
their crazy.

23:15.685 --> 23:18.897
Scare the shit out of 'em
the same way they scare us.

23:18.939 --> 23:20.023
Right.

23:20.065 --> 23:23.193
Fear and intimidation's
probably the only way.

23:23.235 --> 23:26.113
Fear?
Intimidation?

23:26.154 --> 23:28.740
Who's gonna scare
the Milkoviches--us?

23:29.825 --> 23:31.410
Not us, son.

23:32.619 --> 23:34.121
But I know who will.

23:34.162 --> 23:37.082
rock music

23:45.757 --> 23:47.592
What's goin' on here?

23:47.634 --> 23:48.510
[Debbie] Oh, this?

23:48.552 --> 23:51.054
Just wanted to freshen up
Franny's look.

23:51.096 --> 23:52.305
And this is the look

23:52.347 --> 23:54.182
you think screams
Little Miss South Side?

23:54.224 --> 23:55.892
Yeah, sure is.

23:55.934 --> 23:58.478
upbeat music

23:58.520 --> 24:01.022
I never thought I'd live
in the fancy part of town,

24:01.064 --> 24:03.942
but the older I get,
the more I appreciate space,

24:03.984 --> 24:05.110
quiet.

24:05.152 --> 24:07.904
So when we decided
to move back,

24:07.946 --> 24:10.031
Near North just made sense.

24:10.073 --> 24:11.491
-Uh, do you rent or own?
-[Marcos] Own.

24:11.533 --> 24:13.535
It's-it's the only way
to go.

24:13.577 --> 24:15.162
So I hear.

24:15.203 --> 24:16.371
[Lip] Mm.

24:16.413 --> 24:18.081
[Marcos] I'm actually
somewhat of a...

24:18.123 --> 24:19.833
real estate enthusiast,
you know?

24:19.875 --> 24:21.084
Buy, sell,
fix 'em, flip 'em.

24:21.126 --> 24:24.296
Nothing huge,
but if I see the potential,

24:24.337 --> 24:26.840
I'm willing to make
that investment, you know?

24:26.882 --> 24:28.758
Rolling up my sleeves and...

24:28.800 --> 24:30.177
getting to work.

24:30.218 --> 24:32.679
Oh, Lip's been doing all
the renovations at our place.

24:32.721 --> 24:36.266
It was basically a tear-down,
but now...looks pretty great.

24:36.308 --> 24:38.977
-Thank you.
-[Marcos] Good for you, Lip.

24:39.019 --> 24:41.104
Love to check it out
sometime.

24:41.146 --> 24:43.356
Yeah, sure, yeah,
come by anytime.

24:43.398 --> 24:46.943
Oh, uh, I bet Tam-Tam remembers
that first house I owned,

24:46.985 --> 24:48.737
that two-bedroom fixer-upper?

24:48.778 --> 24:50.405
Yes.
Yeah, it was cute.

24:50.447 --> 24:52.491
Sorry, wait,
so you went to his house

24:52.532 --> 24:55.202
when you were a student
and he was a teacher?

24:55.243 --> 24:57.454
[Marcos] Mm-hmm.
She was over all the time.

24:57.496 --> 24:59.414
It was a different era, okay?

24:59.456 --> 25:01.750
People weren't so uptight
back then.

25:01.791 --> 25:02.834
It was 2010.

25:02.876 --> 25:06.213
How 'bout that, uh, little
studio I built in the basement?

25:06.254 --> 25:07.881
Oh, yes!

25:07.923 --> 25:10.675
What was that song
we recorded?

25:11.843 --> 25:14.304
My heart can be

25:14.346 --> 25:16.973
[both]
Such a stranger to me

25:17.015 --> 25:19.017
We come and we go

25:19.059 --> 25:23.063
The only way
we know how

25:23.104 --> 25:25.357
If love's a fortune-teller

25:25.398 --> 25:28.235
We belong together

25:28.276 --> 25:29.903
'Cause I can't

25:29.945 --> 25:33.240
Lose you now

25:33.281 --> 25:35.742
No, I can't

25:35.784 --> 25:38.703
Lose you

25:38.745 --> 25:41.540
You can't help
the one you love

25:41.581 --> 25:45.752
The one you love
is the one you love, so...

25:45.794 --> 25:48.505
bluesy music

25:48.547 --> 25:50.507
So you not gonna arrest me?

25:50.549 --> 25:52.676
No, but for this to work,
you gotta tell me

25:52.717 --> 25:54.636
which two of your boys go
in your place.

25:54.678 --> 25:56.596
[Solo] Uh, word.

25:56.638 --> 25:59.391
[exhales]
A'ight, let me think, uh...

26:00.267 --> 26:02.269
...you can take Cam.
He owe me money.

26:02.310 --> 26:04.854
How's he gonna pay you back
if he's in prison, though?

26:06.022 --> 26:07.941
Good point.
Leave him.

26:09.818 --> 26:11.278
You can take him.

26:11.319 --> 26:13.363
Yeah, he was supposed
to borrow his mom's AC unit,

26:13.405 --> 26:14.781
but he forgot;
that's part of the reason

26:14.823 --> 26:17.200
why we outside and not in
the house in the first place.

26:17.242 --> 26:19.119
All right, who else?

26:19.160 --> 26:20.870
[Solo sucks teeth, sighs]

26:20.912 --> 26:23.748
Mm...
[clicking tongue]

26:23.790 --> 26:25.208
...Twist.

26:25.250 --> 26:27.294
Yeah, you can take Twist.

26:27.335 --> 26:29.004
He talk too much.

26:29.045 --> 26:30.630
Well, think he's a snitch?

26:30.672 --> 26:32.882
Nah, not like that.
No, he just talk a lot.

26:32.924 --> 26:36.052
Mainly about, you know,
the TV and shit he watches.

26:36.094 --> 26:38.805
He really into
all of that British shit.

26:38.847 --> 26:41.766
You know, like  Downton Abbey,
The Crown.

26:42.851 --> 26:44.102
[Carl sighs]

26:45.312 --> 26:47.397
I don't know, man.

26:47.439 --> 26:49.566
You want the Milkoviches
gone fast,

26:49.608 --> 26:51.192
these are the guys to do it.

26:51.234 --> 26:53.194
[Kev] I don't think
these guys are gonna help us,

26:53.236 --> 26:55.822
-considering how white we are.
-[Liam] I'm right here.

26:55.864 --> 26:59.075
Frank, if you were
any more white, you'd be clear.

26:59.117 --> 27:00.744
I shared a cell
with the head guy

27:00.785 --> 27:02.287
back in the '90s.

27:02.329 --> 27:04.039
I speak the lingo.

27:04.080 --> 27:05.665
I understand their ideology.

27:05.707 --> 27:08.668
I'm practically
an honorary member.

27:08.710 --> 27:10.003
Come on.

27:15.925 --> 27:17.260
As-salaam alaikum.

27:17.302 --> 27:19.095
How are y'all?

27:19.137 --> 27:20.513
No need for pleasantries.

27:20.555 --> 27:23.808
We've got sort of a...
neighborhood situation

27:23.850 --> 27:27.145
which might be of interest
to you gents.

27:27.812 --> 27:29.481
[Malik]
Why would this interest us,

27:29.522 --> 27:31.274
the Lost Tribe of Shabazz,

27:31.316 --> 27:34.361
poor righteous teachers,
the fruit of Islam?

27:34.402 --> 27:36.655
Because they're racist.

27:37.155 --> 27:38.865
I'm sure you don't want
racists here.

27:38.907 --> 27:40.659
So you want us to, what,

27:40.700 --> 27:43.578
go over there, strike the fear
of Allah into 'em,

27:43.620 --> 27:46.456
drive 'em out,
use force if we have to?

27:46.498 --> 27:49.000
Yeah, that.
Exactly that.

27:49.042 --> 27:50.168
Go jihad if you have to.

27:50.210 --> 27:51.586
I'm glad
we're on the same page.

27:51.628 --> 27:52.879
You know what this
sounds like to me?

27:52.921 --> 27:56.007
A perfect opportunity
for us all to work together

27:56.049 --> 27:57.759
against a common enemy.

27:57.801 --> 27:59.552
Sounds like a Yacubian devil
problem,

27:59.594 --> 28:01.262
and we got no business
joinin' one devil

28:01.304 --> 28:02.722
in his fight against the other.

28:02.764 --> 28:05.308
I'm sorry, um...
I missed that first part.

28:05.350 --> 28:08.144
-Yacubi what?
-It means white people.

28:08.186 --> 28:09.646
Oh, we're the devil.

28:09.688 --> 28:11.856
Right, got it.
Carry on.

28:13.191 --> 28:15.652
If not for us...

28:17.028 --> 28:18.863
...do it for him.

28:19.948 --> 28:22.701
Little brother, is it true
what this devil is saying

28:22.742 --> 28:25.078
about the more devilish devils
next door?

28:26.079 --> 28:28.748
-You scared?
-Terrified.

28:32.669 --> 28:34.421
We'll do it
but only to demonstrate

28:34.462 --> 28:36.589
the awesome power
the Asiatic Black man possesses

28:36.631 --> 28:39.134
when we stand fearlessly
against the wicked ways

28:39.175 --> 28:40.635
of those who would oppress us.

28:40.677 --> 28:42.554
Now, who are these devils
we evictin'?

28:42.595 --> 28:43.638
What are their names?

28:43.680 --> 28:45.140
Well, these particular devils

28:45.181 --> 28:46.891
go by the name of Milkovich.

28:46.933 --> 28:48.935
[person clears throat]

28:51.813 --> 28:53.356
You know, I forgot.
[chuckles]

28:53.398 --> 28:55.275
I forgot we got a pray thing
that we gotta do.

28:55.316 --> 28:58.153
We-we pray, like,
five times a day.

28:58.194 --> 29:00.905
So we gon-we gonna do that.

29:00.947 --> 29:02.240
Good luck to you fellas.

29:02.282 --> 29:04.951
Peace and blessings.

29:09.038 --> 29:10.123
[door slams]

29:12.917 --> 29:15.086
[Ilene sighs]

29:15.628 --> 29:19.257
Come on, Franny, the judges
asked you what you like to do.

29:20.258 --> 29:21.301
What'd you tell me last week?

29:21.342 --> 29:23.136
You like to, uh, dress up
like a princess.

29:23.178 --> 29:24.637
You--your doll house
collection.

29:24.679 --> 29:25.764
Tell 'em about that.

29:25.805 --> 29:28.683
Why don't we just skip on
to the talent portion?

29:28.725 --> 29:30.810
Right, uh...come on, baby.
Sing your song.

29:30.852 --> 29:33.104
-Mm-mm.
-Sing your song, Franny.

29:33.146 --> 29:34.314
Mm-mm.

29:34.355 --> 29:35.857
[whispering]
Don't do this to me.

29:35.899 --> 29:38.485
-[door clicks open]
-[Veronica] Scuse me.

29:38.526 --> 29:41.488
I just wanna remind
the panel of esteemed judges

29:41.529 --> 29:43.323
about the strict time limit.

29:43.364 --> 29:46.618
Unfortunately, this
contestant's time has elapsed

29:46.659 --> 29:48.453
98 seconds ago.

29:48.495 --> 29:49.746
Oh, thank God.
She's right.

29:49.788 --> 29:51.414
-That is all!
-But she--

29:51.456 --> 29:54.125
[Ilene] Miss Gallagher,
your time's up.

29:54.167 --> 29:57.128
upbeat music

30:02.133 --> 30:04.594
[dogs barking]

30:04.636 --> 30:06.638
Look, it's SEAL Team Dicks.

30:06.679 --> 30:09.390
Oh, no, they're trying
to infiltrate our breach

30:09.432 --> 30:11.142
from the rear.

30:11.184 --> 30:13.269
[laughter]

30:13.311 --> 30:14.896
[door slams]

30:14.938 --> 30:16.397
[Kev] Jesus.

30:16.439 --> 30:18.107
A little overdressed,
don't you think?

30:18.149 --> 30:19.400
[Frank laughs]

30:19.442 --> 30:20.777
Look, you want your money
to be safe or not?

30:20.819 --> 30:22.362
Let's get to it.
What's the job?

30:22.403 --> 30:23.571
[Kev] Pretty straightforward.

30:23.613 --> 30:24.739
Just take the money
to the grow house

30:24.781 --> 30:26.825
so we can get on
the regular delivery list.

30:26.866 --> 30:29.744
Grow house?
I thought I was your supplier.

30:29.786 --> 30:31.246
Supply and demand leveled out.

30:31.287 --> 30:33.248
Everyone's got legal product
again.

30:33.289 --> 30:35.166
Well, for fuck's sake, Kev.

30:35.208 --> 30:36.543
[Mickey] All right.

30:36.584 --> 30:38.711
Chop-chop.
Collect the money.

30:40.255 --> 30:41.881
You collect the money.

30:42.507 --> 30:43.967
I'm the boss, 'member?

30:44.008 --> 30:46.719
[laughs] I just supervise
and shit; you do all the work.

30:46.761 --> 30:49.848
Uh, fuck you.
I don't work for you.

30:49.889 --> 30:52.141
[Mickey] You're making me
look bad, asshole.

30:54.853 --> 30:56.312
All right,
I got two of these

30:56.354 --> 30:58.273
in case you got
too much cash to move.

30:58.314 --> 30:59.899
All right.
Turn around.

30:59.941 --> 31:02.235
Where I keep my money's
for my eyes only.

31:02.277 --> 31:03.319
[scoffs]

31:03.361 --> 31:05.822
I'm serious!
Turn around.

31:06.614 --> 31:09.158
[whispering]
Put your head down.

31:09.200 --> 31:12.161
funky music

31:24.966 --> 31:26.342
Okay.

31:26.384 --> 31:28.845
There ya go.

31:28.887 --> 31:31.222
-[music stops]
-What's this?

31:31.264 --> 31:32.932
Yesterday's profits.

31:34.767 --> 31:37.061
This is only, like,
1,500 bucks.

31:37.103 --> 31:38.813
$1,653.

31:38.855 --> 31:41.190
Take that money, minus
your cut, to the grow house.

31:41.232 --> 31:42.734
They're waiting.

31:48.114 --> 31:49.407
This is--

31:54.746 --> 31:57.206
What are we gonna do
about the Milkoviches?

31:58.458 --> 32:01.336
We could go to
the Nation of Islam for help.

32:01.377 --> 32:03.296
-Those guys are--
-We just did that, Frank,

32:03.338 --> 32:05.131
literally less
than an hour ago.

32:05.715 --> 32:06.674
I know that.

32:06.716 --> 32:09.469
Th-th-that's-that's not
what I meant!

32:09.510 --> 32:12.305
I meant we could go back

32:12.347 --> 32:15.183
or we could get
to Mrs. McCurdy,

32:15.224 --> 32:17.352
talk to her,

32:17.393 --> 32:20.229
try to convince her
to evict them.

32:20.271 --> 32:22.273
Record her living conditions.

32:22.315 --> 32:23.775
It's gotta be horrific
in there

32:23.816 --> 32:26.069
now that the Milkoviches
have moved in.

32:26.110 --> 32:28.529
There's no way
they'd let 'em stay there

32:28.571 --> 32:30.490
if there was proof
of elder abuse.

32:30.531 --> 32:32.617
There's no way they're gonna
let you get near her.

32:32.659 --> 32:34.243
They got that place
surrounded.

32:34.285 --> 32:36.829
If we created a distraction,

32:36.871 --> 32:38.498
draw them to the front
of the house,

32:38.539 --> 32:39.999
I could sneak in the back.

32:40.041 --> 32:43.169
What gets white trash's
attention?

32:43.962 --> 32:45.880
A Trans Am that needs fixin'?

32:45.922 --> 32:48.800
A Black athlete
disrespecting our flag.

32:48.841 --> 32:51.511
-A gun rally.
-A Klan rally.

32:51.552 --> 32:53.805
A monster truck rally.

32:53.846 --> 32:55.640
Well, any rally, really.

32:55.682 --> 32:58.142
I think I know
what might do the trick.

32:58.935 --> 33:00.812
Let me get my running shoes.

33:00.853 --> 33:05.066
I am just a fan
of all your power and might

33:05.108 --> 33:08.111
I know you can,
you're the man...

33:08.152 --> 33:10.154
[Lip sighs]

33:10.822 --> 33:14.242
Well, let's get goin'

33:14.283 --> 33:16.285
Let's get goin'

33:17.745 --> 33:19.247
You got it

33:19.288 --> 33:20.748
Let's get goin'

33:22.458 --> 33:23.668
You got it

33:23.710 --> 33:27.005
All right, you haven't
said a word since brunch.

33:27.046 --> 33:29.340
Well, that is because
I'm pretty much speechless.

33:29.382 --> 33:30.842
Okay.

33:31.551 --> 33:32.844
Why?

33:32.885 --> 33:37.515
Oh, maybe 'cause you fucked
your teacher in high school?

33:38.516 --> 33:39.767
What? No.

33:39.809 --> 33:42.520
No, so-so you didn't
fuck your teacher.

33:44.439 --> 33:46.315
-We dated.
-Oh.

33:46.357 --> 33:48.860
It was a serious relationship.

33:51.070 --> 33:52.697
Okay, yeah,
we slept together.

33:52.739 --> 33:54.615
-But it was beautiful.
-God, I knew it.

33:54.657 --> 33:56.784
You couldn't have given me
a heads-up before brunch?

33:56.826 --> 33:58.703
No, because I figured
you wouldn't get it.

33:58.745 --> 34:00.872
Nobody gets it.

34:00.913 --> 34:02.040
Look, you're already
judging me.

34:02.081 --> 34:04.125
You were a kid.
That's some pedophile shit!

34:04.167 --> 34:08.337
I was mature for my age,
and I went after him, so...

34:08.713 --> 34:11.299
You don't know
how it was between us.

34:11.340 --> 34:13.176
Okay, I wasn't a child.

34:13.217 --> 34:14.844
He saw me for me.

34:14.886 --> 34:16.971
I saw him for him.

34:17.013 --> 34:18.931
That's what made it beautiful.

34:22.477 --> 34:24.604
I gotta go work on my bike.

34:27.774 --> 34:29.776
What the hell was that
in there?

34:29.817 --> 34:32.195
Oh, just making sure the judges
are abidin' by their own rules.

34:32.236 --> 34:34.322
-Nothing personal.
-It sure feels personal.

34:34.363 --> 34:36.199
It feels like you're trying
to sabotage Franny.

34:36.240 --> 34:39.660
When you're used to privilege,
equality feels like oppression.

34:39.702 --> 34:41.537
Privilege? Me?

34:41.579 --> 34:43.873
I grew up worse off than you--
with Frank!

34:43.915 --> 34:46.667
Yeah, who ever heard
of a little blonde girl

34:46.709 --> 34:48.961
getting special treatment?

34:49.003 --> 34:52.090
Scuse me.
Amy has to go to the bathroom.

34:55.718 --> 34:57.678
That bitch.

34:57.720 --> 35:00.098
Maybe you should just drop it.

35:01.390 --> 35:02.850
Fuck that.

35:02.892 --> 35:05.144
Hey, Franny,
I have a great idea.

35:05.186 --> 35:07.021
Do you wanna help Gemma
with her makeup?

35:07.063 --> 35:10.066
I think that you could
make her look really pretty.

35:11.150 --> 35:12.902
-Wanna do it?
-Debbie, don't.

35:12.944 --> 35:14.487
V started it.

35:23.371 --> 35:26.624
Oh, this lady sure does have
a massive set of balls.

35:33.464 --> 35:36.259
dramatic music

35:36.300 --> 35:38.970
Well, hey there, Officer.
Something I can get you?

35:39.011 --> 35:41.931
What--ow! Are you--
What is wrong with you?

35:41.973 --> 35:45.726
Get off of me!
Hell is wrong with you?

35:45.768 --> 35:47.979
Oh, you crazy!
Aah!

35:48.020 --> 35:49.772
Fucking get off of me!

35:53.818 --> 35:55.987
-What are you do--
-Hey!

36:07.623 --> 36:09.584
[Miss June] No!
[grunts]

36:19.844 --> 36:23.014
Last...warning.

36:23.806 --> 36:25.558
Well, fuck you, then,
you raggedy old,

36:25.600 --> 36:27.101
dusty old, musty old,
oink-oink,

36:27.143 --> 36:29.437
Porky Pig, Oscar Mayer bacon
bitch!

36:29.478 --> 36:31.147
Fuck the police!

36:32.148 --> 36:34.317
What did you just say to me?

36:34.692 --> 36:37.320
You really expect me
to repeat all that?

36:39.155 --> 36:40.698
-Strip.
-[gun cocking]

36:41.949 --> 36:43.409
Bitch, I said strip!

36:45.077 --> 36:48.164
Lose the dress now.

36:57.924 --> 36:59.258
Wig too.

37:00.760 --> 37:02.720
-Leesie.
-No, she gonna learn.

37:02.762 --> 37:03.763
Wig!

37:09.560 --> 37:11.187
Come on, now!

37:16.734 --> 37:18.444
Let's go to the car
and get a Red Bull.

37:18.486 --> 37:21.072
I'm having a 2:30
in the afternoon sorta feeling,

37:21.113 --> 37:22.531
know what I'm saying?

37:22.573 --> 37:24.075
[Miss June sobs]

37:31.707 --> 37:33.584
death metal music

37:33.626 --> 37:36.128
[Kev] Enough is enough!

37:36.170 --> 37:38.756
We won't tolerate hate
in this neighborhood.

37:38.798 --> 37:41.801
[music blaring on stereo]

37:46.681 --> 37:48.683
Mm-hmm.

37:48.724 --> 37:50.851
-This is stupid.
-You say stupid.

37:50.893 --> 37:52.353
I say necessary.

37:52.395 --> 37:55.273
[dog barking]

38:00.444 --> 38:02.071
Hey, buddy.

38:02.113 --> 38:03.781
How ya doing?

38:03.823 --> 38:05.283
It's Frank.
Remember me? I'm--

38:05.324 --> 38:07.368
I mean, yeah,
I live in the hood.

38:07.410 --> 38:09.578
You remember?
Yeah, you know me!

38:09.620 --> 38:11.038
-[dog whimpers]
-Yeah!

38:17.378 --> 38:18.337
Hmm?

38:18.379 --> 38:20.673
Oh, yeah.

38:20.715 --> 38:24.093
[inhales]
That one's gotta hurt, huh?

38:24.135 --> 38:26.345
I got a whole stack of these.

38:26.387 --> 38:28.973
I'm thinkin' about
burning all of 'em.

38:29.015 --> 38:32.184
I think we just spooked him.
Come on.

38:34.729 --> 38:36.689
-[dog barking]
-Jesus! Okay! Okay!

38:36.731 --> 38:39.066
Ooh, ooh,
easy, easy, easy, easy.

38:39.108 --> 38:42.111
Holy shit!
Even their dog is racist.

38:42.153 --> 38:44.488
[laughing]
How 'bout that?

38:44.530 --> 38:46.073
I think you gotta go in.

38:46.115 --> 38:47.908
The Milkoviches
have probably fantasized

38:47.950 --> 38:50.870
about finding some Black kid
breaking into their house.

38:50.911 --> 38:52.580
Every cause needs a martyr.

38:52.621 --> 38:54.040
No, Frank.

38:54.081 --> 38:57.168
I-I'm the only one
who can keep the dog quiet.

38:57.209 --> 38:59.462
If he keeps barking,
we're gonna get caught.

39:00.087 --> 39:02.631
I'm counting on you, son.

39:02.673 --> 39:04.675
We all are.

39:08.637 --> 39:09.805
[sighs]

39:09.847 --> 39:11.557
[Frank whispering]
Easy.

39:16.145 --> 39:18.564
[Kev] What are you gonna do?

39:18.606 --> 39:19.732
You gonna chase me, huh?

39:19.774 --> 39:21.692
Gonna try to stop me,
beat me up?

39:21.734 --> 39:22.943
Why would we do that?

39:22.985 --> 39:25.988
I'm literally torching
your entire belief system.

39:26.030 --> 39:27.406
It's incredibly disrespectful.

39:27.448 --> 39:29.200
I don't know.
It's just paper, man.

39:29.241 --> 39:30.993
[Joey] Yeah,
symbols are just symbols.

39:31.035 --> 39:33.913
I mean, even that
big old flag back there--

39:33.954 --> 39:35.790
it's meaningless, really.

39:35.831 --> 39:37.458
What are you talking about?

39:37.500 --> 39:39.919
Real racism--
it's in our hearts,

39:39.960 --> 39:42.546
in our minds, in our souls.

39:42.588 --> 39:43.923
Can't burn that, dude.

[cell phone dings]

40:34.765 --> 40:36.600
Are you okay?

40:36.642 --> 40:40.020
Are you being held here
against your will?

40:40.062 --> 40:42.148
[sighs]

40:42.189 --> 40:44.900
Have all these people
moved into your house

40:44.942 --> 40:46.610
without your permission?

40:48.112 --> 40:49.738
Mrs. McCurdy,

40:49.780 --> 40:53.951
is there anything you can
tell me about Terry Milkovich?

40:57.580 --> 41:00.416
Terry Milkovich?

41:01.000 --> 41:03.669
I'll tell you about Terry.

41:03.711 --> 41:05.254
He's a beast.

41:08.924 --> 41:09.884
[Mikey]
How was I supposed to know

41:09.925 --> 41:10.968
they didn't have any money?

41:11.010 --> 41:11.927
[Ian] Well, you should have
checked how much

41:11.969 --> 41:13.095
we'd actually be transporting.

41:13.137 --> 41:14.346
Well, it wouldn't matter
if you hadn't made us buy

41:14.388 --> 41:15.431
this stupid-ass
SWAT team shit.

41:15.473 --> 41:16.849
Which wouldn't fucking matter

41:16.891 --> 41:18.100
if you made half as much
as you promised.

41:18.142 --> 41:20.352
"Oh, could be thousands,
maybe millions.

41:20.394 --> 41:22.104
Be fucking billionaires
by Tuesday."

41:22.146 --> 41:23.981
You know what?
You're fuckin' fired.

41:24.023 --> 41:26.233
You can't fire somebody
you never employed.

41:26.275 --> 41:28.444
I was trying to help you out.

41:39.079 --> 41:41.290
[Mickey] Holy shit!

41:54.303 --> 41:56.347
Uh, hey, Tam,
where's my soap?

41:56.388 --> 41:58.307
You know,
the grease pumice stuff.

41:58.349 --> 42:00.518
-Oh, I put it under the sink.
-Why?

42:00.559 --> 42:03.646
I want the nice shit out.
We're having company.

42:03.687 --> 42:05.231
-We are?
-Yeah.

42:05.272 --> 42:07.316
Marcos and his fiancée.

42:07.358 --> 42:08.567
Twice in one day?

42:08.609 --> 42:10.819
I mean, brunch
was more than enough,

42:10.861 --> 42:11.946
don't you think?

42:11.987 --> 42:13.697
Well, you're the one
who invited him.

42:13.739 --> 42:14.865
The fuck I did.

42:14.907 --> 42:16.617
You said,
"Come by anytime."

42:16.659 --> 42:19.578
Well, he's taking you up
on your offer.

42:19.620 --> 42:20.829
[Lip] Mm.

[doorbell rings]

42:27.419 --> 42:29.171
-Hi.
-Hi!

42:29.213 --> 42:30.839
This is Kelly...

42:32.049 --> 42:33.342
...my fiancée.

42:33.384 --> 42:34.885
Hi.
[giggles]

42:57.241 --> 42:59.326
You okay, Eilish?

42:59.368 --> 43:00.286
Mm-hmm.

43:00.327 --> 43:03.247
All right, well,
good shift today, man.

43:03.289 --> 43:05.416
You're really taking
to this police shit.

43:05.457 --> 43:07.126
You gonna be a decent cop.

43:07.167 --> 43:09.003
Just clean out the car,
go on home,

43:09.044 --> 43:10.170
get some rest...

43:10.212 --> 43:11.797
back at it again tomorrow.

43:11.839 --> 43:13.424
More heads to bust.

funky music

43:27.229 --> 43:29.690
Before we make
our final decision,

43:29.732 --> 43:31.483
we'd like to ask
each of the mothers

43:31.525 --> 43:33.569
to explain
what excites them most

43:33.611 --> 43:36.238
about the Little Miss
South Side title.

43:36.280 --> 43:38.365
We can start with you,
Miss Gallagher.

43:38.407 --> 43:39.992
Well...[exhales]

43:40.034 --> 43:41.577
...I think that Franny is

43:41.619 --> 43:44.121
most excited about
becoming an ambassador

43:44.163 --> 43:45.414
for our community,

43:45.456 --> 43:46.540
showing the rest of the city

43:46.582 --> 43:47.791
what the South Side's
all about.

43:47.833 --> 43:50.294
Whether it's, uh, going
to a little league game

43:50.336 --> 43:53.422
or a parade or the grand
opening of a new Arby's,

43:53.464 --> 43:54.923
there's no place
that we won't go.

43:54.965 --> 43:57.009
[Veronica, muffled]
Do you even go to those places?

43:57.051 --> 43:58.427
Excuse me?

43:58.469 --> 44:01.347
I'm just saying,
given your status,

44:01.388 --> 44:03.265
are you allowed to go
to those events?

44:03.307 --> 44:05.351
Are you allowed to be here?

44:05.392 --> 44:07.436
Uh...[chuckles nervously]

44:07.478 --> 44:09.563
...I got special permission.

44:09.605 --> 44:11.190
I'm sorry, what status?

44:11.231 --> 44:13.359
She's a registered
sex offender.

44:13.400 --> 44:15.402
Hot lesbian convict?
That's her.

44:15.444 --> 44:16.320
You bitch!

44:16.362 --> 44:17.613
Who you callin' a bitch, bitch?

44:17.655 --> 44:19.365
You, you drug-dealing bitch!

44:19.406 --> 44:20.532
She's a drug dealer.
She deals drugs.

44:20.574 --> 44:23.827
[Veronica] I am a legal
cannabis entrepreneur!

44:23.869 --> 44:26.330
[overlapping shouting]

44:26.372 --> 44:27.665
What, a Black woman can't be...

44:27.706 --> 44:29.333
Technically, I am a registered
sex offender...

44:29.375 --> 44:31.418
And look what she did
to my daughter's face.

44:31.460 --> 44:32.753
[Debbie]
I would never touch a child!

44:32.795 --> 44:35.005
[Veronica] A broke-down little
1980s pageant little girl!

44:36.715 --> 44:38.592
[Trisha]
Okay, I guess this is enough

44:38.634 --> 44:41.011
to keep them back
on our delivery schedule.

44:41.053 --> 44:43.472
-Barely.
-All right, thanks.

44:43.514 --> 44:45.057
I'll let 'em know.

44:45.099 --> 44:46.392
[Trisha] You guys new?

44:46.433 --> 44:48.560
Haven't seen you around
before.

44:48.602 --> 44:50.312
What are you guys...

44:50.354 --> 44:52.564
ex-military, Rangers,

44:52.606 --> 44:54.483
SEALs, Delta Force?

44:54.525 --> 44:57.361
Uh, y-yeah, yeah.
All that shit.

44:57.403 --> 45:00.447
I, uh...I-I just got back
from, uh,

45:00.489 --> 45:02.408
mowin' down terrorists
overseas, you know?

45:02.449 --> 45:05.411
Took out a whole...

45:05.452 --> 45:06.328
village.

45:06.370 --> 45:07.287
Fuck those guys.

45:07.329 --> 45:08.789
-[Trisha laughs] Right on.
-Yeah.

45:08.831 --> 45:12.084
I could need another pro
security firm on our roster.

45:12.126 --> 45:14.294
Business...is booming.

45:14.336 --> 45:16.422
We can't keep up with all
the pickups and deliveries.

45:16.463 --> 45:19.258
Oh, I am your man, you know?
Very professional.

45:19.299 --> 45:20.300
Extra professional.

45:20.342 --> 45:22.344
Uh, how much are we
gonna get paid?

45:22.386 --> 45:23.470
It's gotta be worth our time.

45:23.512 --> 45:26.223
Going rate is a grand a day.

45:28.308 --> 45:30.310
That's a little lower
than what I'm used to,

45:30.352 --> 45:32.354
but, uh...

45:32.396 --> 45:34.565
we'll make it work, ya know?

45:35.274 --> 45:37.401
Uh, so, yeah, we still got
a lot of work

45:37.443 --> 45:38.652
we wanna do in here.

45:38.694 --> 45:42.156
Um...maybe some
under-cabinet LEDs.

45:42.197 --> 45:44.616
Uh, exhaust hood here,
obviously.

45:44.658 --> 45:47.286
Yeah, yeah, no, I like
how you smoothed the grout...

45:47.327 --> 45:49.413
where you really should have
used some quarter round.

45:49.455 --> 45:51.415
They didn't have any
quarter round available?

45:51.457 --> 45:53.417
-Well, shit's expensive, so...
-[Marcos] Yeah.

45:53.459 --> 45:55.252
But it's worth it.

45:56.336 --> 45:57.880
When I was young like you,

45:57.921 --> 46:00.424
-I went for efficiency.
-[Lip] Uh-huh.

46:00.466 --> 46:03.719
But eventually, I learned
the value of quality.

46:04.803 --> 46:06.305
No rush.

46:06.346 --> 46:08.682
That's the advantage
of experience.

46:08.724 --> 46:11.393
You just take it nice and slow

46:11.435 --> 46:13.103
and get it all the way right.

46:13.145 --> 46:16.273
[Kelly giggles]

46:18.066 --> 46:19.359
Uh, Kelly, we weren't sure

46:19.401 --> 46:21.195
we'd get the chance
to meet you.

46:21.236 --> 46:23.363
Um, how did
that job interview go?

46:23.405 --> 46:25.032
Job interview?

46:25.073 --> 46:27.618
Yeah, that's where Marcos said
you were today, right?

46:27.659 --> 46:29.661
Admissions interview
for school.

46:29.703 --> 46:31.872
Oh! Uh, what-what schools
you lookin' at,

46:31.914 --> 46:34.291
Northwestern, Columbia,
Loyola?

46:34.333 --> 46:37.336
[giggles] Uh, Greenfield Prep.
High school.

46:37.377 --> 46:39.213
I'm one semester short
of graduating.

46:39.254 --> 46:41.340
Uh, wait.
So you were his student?

46:41.381 --> 46:44.134
Uh...technically, I guess.

46:44.176 --> 46:47.262
But...he saw me for me.

46:47.304 --> 46:49.223
And I saw him for him, and...

46:49.264 --> 46:50.265
[sighs]

46:50.307 --> 46:52.142
...that's what makes us
so special.

46:52.184 --> 46:53.310
Right.

46:58.398 --> 46:59.525
[Ilene] Okay.

46:59.566 --> 47:01.401
After careful deliberation,

47:01.443 --> 47:03.195
we'd like to announce
the winner.

47:03.237 --> 47:04.112
[Veronica] Wait.

47:04.154 --> 47:05.239
Before you announce the winner,

47:05.280 --> 47:06.573
I never got a chance to say

47:06.615 --> 47:10.118
why my family is excited
about this title.

47:12.621 --> 47:15.582
I grew up on the South Side.

47:15.624 --> 47:17.793
And I know what it would mean

47:17.835 --> 47:20.379
to the little Black girls
who live here

47:20.420 --> 47:22.631
to see someone
who looks like them

47:22.673 --> 47:24.675
wearing that tiara and sash.

47:24.716 --> 47:28.011
I know what it will mean
to them to have someone

47:28.053 --> 47:30.722
who looks like my Gemma.

47:30.764 --> 47:32.683
The South Side
doesn't really feel like

47:32.724 --> 47:34.351
the South Side anymore,

47:34.393 --> 47:37.563
at least not in the way
that I remember it.

47:37.604 --> 47:40.357
But that doesn't mean
we should stop trying

47:40.399 --> 47:44.236
to preserve what makes
our community special.

47:44.278 --> 47:45.904
And it's not just about race.

47:45.946 --> 47:49.283
It's about pride.
It's about perseverance.

47:49.324 --> 47:50.909
It's about working together

47:50.951 --> 47:53.370
to strive
for the American dream,

47:53.412 --> 47:57.165
even though it feels
a million miles away.

47:58.834 --> 48:01.420
I guess all I'm sayin' is,

48:01.461 --> 48:02.921
Little Miss South Side

48:02.963 --> 48:05.591
should represent
the South Side,

48:05.632 --> 48:07.968
not just in the way she looks

48:08.010 --> 48:10.679
but also in the way
she can inspire.

48:10.721 --> 48:12.639
She should show little girls

48:12.681 --> 48:15.267
that you can still aim
to be something

48:15.309 --> 48:16.894
and maybe those dreams...

48:16.935 --> 48:19.688
are just a little closer
than you think they are.

[applause]

48:55.307 --> 48:58.143
Terry Milkovich?

48:58.769 --> 49:01.063
I'll tell you about Terry.

49:01.104 --> 49:02.648
He's a beast.

49:02.689 --> 49:06.234
A beast in the sack.

49:06.276 --> 49:09.196
And I thank God every day

49:09.237 --> 49:11.156
that he came into my life.

49:11.198 --> 49:14.326
And then I ask God
to avert his eyes,

49:14.368 --> 49:16.703
because what we do...

49:16.745 --> 49:18.205
it's a sin.

49:18.246 --> 49:21.667
Have you ever heard
of something called

49:21.708 --> 49:24.586
fisting, young man?

49:24.628 --> 49:27.339
That's where Terry
makes a fist

49:27.381 --> 49:28.674
and shoves it up my--

49:28.715 --> 49:30.467
All right, all right, enough.

49:31.468 --> 49:32.761
We pissed off the Milkoviches,

49:32.803 --> 49:34.554
and we managed
to make things worse.

49:34.596 --> 49:38.600
Well, chin up, lad.
We'll be at it again tomorrow.

49:38.642 --> 49:42.145
What time should I come by
so we can get started, 11?

49:42.187 --> 49:45.440
[engine revving,
rock music blaring over stereo]

49:45.482 --> 49:48.443
[people shouting and cheering]

49:48.485 --> 49:51.196
[scoffs]
And they're still comin'.

49:51.238 --> 49:54.783
How many more of these fuckers
can they cram into that dump?

49:54.825 --> 49:57.327
[engine revs]

49:59.454 --> 50:02.457
[people shouting and cheering]

50:06.169 --> 50:07.879
[Frank groans]

50:10.716 --> 50:13.218
Hey, neighbors! Ah.

50:13.260 --> 50:14.511
I hope you don't mind

50:14.553 --> 50:17.389
our takin' over the empty lot
next door to ya.

50:17.431 --> 50:19.641
House was gettin' crowded.

50:19.683 --> 50:21.393
But this works, right?

50:22.936 --> 50:26.773
[Frank] Jesus, now we're
surrounded by Milkoviches.

50:39.036 --> 50:41.830
Can you believe that little
Syrian heifer stole our crown?

50:41.872 --> 50:43.415
Ugh. I know.

50:43.457 --> 50:44.958
I mean,
we're from the South Side.

50:45.000 --> 50:47.335
What the hell
has she been through?

50:48.378 --> 50:49.921
I'm sorry, Debs.

50:50.464 --> 50:51.590
Me too.

50:51.631 --> 50:54.176
-We cool?
-Yeah.

50:54.217 --> 50:56.595
Well, if you two are done
kissing and making up,

50:56.636 --> 50:58.513
-I sort of wanna...
-Yeah, let's get out of here.

50:58.555 --> 50:59.473
...get the fuck out.

50:59.514 --> 51:01.558
-See ya, V.
-[Veronica] Bye, girl.

51:02.476 --> 51:04.102
Oh, I almost forgot.

51:04.936 --> 51:06.521
[Jenkins] Miss Fisher.

51:06.563 --> 51:08.690
Alderman Jenkins.

51:08.732 --> 51:10.150
I really enjoyed your speech.

51:10.192 --> 51:13.487
Not enough to vote
for my Gemma.

51:13.528 --> 51:15.322
Look, between you, me,
and the lamppost,

51:15.363 --> 51:17.407
this event is put on
by the Chamber of Commerce.

51:17.449 --> 51:19.034
Their goal
is to generate commerce.

51:19.076 --> 51:22.412
They see all these gentrifiers
as a way of making more money.

51:22.454 --> 51:24.039
And that Syrian girl's
sob story

51:24.081 --> 51:26.917
appeals to millennials
and bleeding hearts.

51:29.211 --> 51:31.004
The Chamber
is a major contributor

51:31.046 --> 51:32.923
to my reelection campaign.

51:32.964 --> 51:35.217
Can't bite the hand
that feeds me, but...

51:35.258 --> 51:36.093
I could use you.

51:36.134 --> 51:38.929
Democratic Party of Chicago
could use you.

51:38.970 --> 51:39.971
Someone with your passion,

51:40.013 --> 51:42.557
with your gift
for persuasive speech...

51:42.599 --> 51:44.101
you've got talent.

51:44.142 --> 51:46.019
-Thank you.
-[laughs lightly]

51:46.061 --> 51:47.896
I'd love to pick your brain
sometime,

51:47.938 --> 51:49.147
get your opinion
on local issues,

51:49.189 --> 51:50.649
see where there might be
an opportunity

51:50.690 --> 51:52.442
to get you involved.

51:54.778 --> 51:56.488
Okay, drive safe.
Thanks again.

51:56.530 --> 51:57.739
Yeah, appreciate you guys
coming by.

51:57.781 --> 51:58.907
Again soon, okay?

51:58.949 --> 52:00.659
Maybe we can get together--

52:00.700 --> 52:01.785
[door slams]

52:01.827 --> 52:05.038
What...the...fuck?

52:05.080 --> 52:07.124
I-I mean,
what's the matter with him?

52:07.165 --> 52:09.918
-She's, like, ten!
-Seventeen, she said.

52:09.960 --> 52:11.837
Eighteen soon.

52:11.878 --> 52:13.088
Age ain't nothin'
but a number, right?

52:13.130 --> 52:15.048
It's gotta be, what--
it's, what...

52:15.090 --> 52:17.634
daddy issues?
[scoffs]

52:19.803 --> 52:21.555
I mean, I didn't have
daddy issues.

52:21.596 --> 52:23.682
I don't have daddy issues.

52:24.724 --> 52:28.103
[scoffs]
I mean, I love my dad, yeah,

52:28.145 --> 52:31.189
but in a completely normal,
healthy way.

52:31.731 --> 52:33.191
Right.

52:33.233 --> 52:35.735
[scoffs]

52:35.777 --> 52:37.654
You think I have daddy issues.

52:38.780 --> 52:40.490
-Uh...
-You know what?

52:40.532 --> 52:41.867
Fuck off! I do not!

52:41.908 --> 52:44.077
Come on, you've been
around my family.

52:44.119 --> 52:47.497
Yeah, we have our quirks,
but we're pretty normal.

52:47.539 --> 52:48.915
And sure,

52:48.957 --> 52:50.584
I guess, you know,
when my mom died,

52:50.625 --> 52:52.002
we all got thrown for a loop.

52:52.043 --> 52:53.420
But that's normal.

52:53.461 --> 52:55.088
And Cami, she took the reins

52:55.130 --> 52:56.715
and she went from being
my big sister

52:56.756 --> 52:59.843
to de facto mom,
and my dad, he stepped up

52:59.885 --> 53:01.428
and he put all of his attention
on Cory

53:01.469 --> 53:03.305
'cause she was the baby
and she needed her dad.

53:03.346 --> 53:05.891
And that--you know,
that left me...

53:05.932 --> 53:07.434
[sigh exasperatedly]

53:07.475 --> 53:09.394
[huffs]

53:09.436 --> 53:11.229
...in the middle...

53:12.856 --> 53:14.399
...alone...

53:16.151 --> 53:18.570
...desperate for attention.

53:21.031 --> 53:22.741
And that's...

53:22.782 --> 53:24.618
right when I started
dating Marcos.

53:24.659 --> 53:26.411
Oh, my God.

53:30.081 --> 53:32.250
I have daddy issues.

53:32.292 --> 53:33.543
[groans]

53:38.006 --> 53:41.801
I thought I was...
so smart

53:41.843 --> 53:43.678
and mature.

53:44.137 --> 53:47.682
But really, I was needy
and daddy-starved

53:47.724 --> 53:49.351
and dumb.

53:49.392 --> 53:50.977
I mean, I got played
by a pedophile.

53:51.019 --> 53:53.688
God, I am a fucking cliché.

53:53.730 --> 53:55.482
Ah.

53:55.523 --> 53:56.942
[sighs]

53:56.983 --> 53:58.610
soft music

53:58.652 --> 54:00.779
[Lip] Hmm.

54:00.820 --> 54:03.657
-You're not dumb.
-Mm.

54:03.698 --> 54:04.908
All right?

54:04.950 --> 54:07.661
You were immature
and vulnerable,

54:07.702 --> 54:09.579
and he took advantage of you.

54:10.455 --> 54:11.957
Now you're smarter.

54:11.998 --> 54:15.168
You make great decisions,

54:15.210 --> 54:16.962
like choosing
an age-appropriate,

54:17.003 --> 54:18.713
handsome stud like me.

54:18.755 --> 54:20.674
[laughs breathily]

54:26.888 --> 54:30.267

54:32.102 --> 54:35.480
[person shouts, glass shatters
distantly]

54:39.609 --> 54:41.611
I don't want no smoke.

54:41.653 --> 54:43.321
Po-po, go away.

54:43.363 --> 54:44.239
Go away!

54:44.281 --> 54:45.865
Look, you can just leave me
the hell alone,

54:45.907 --> 54:47.867
because I ain't sellin' shit.

54:48.326 --> 54:51.579
Somme's "Goin' On" playing

55:00.213 --> 55:01.589
A little older,
I don't mind it

55:01.631 --> 55:03.300
'Cause she's got
her shit together

55:03.341 --> 55:05.885
Like nobody else I know

55:05.927 --> 55:07.220
She's pretty much a batter

55:07.262 --> 55:08.638
But she'll never
let you call her that

55:08.680 --> 55:11.766
She's humble
so I run from her, uh-huh

55:11.808 --> 55:14.227
Steady on the daily, no,
she's never acting shady...

55:14.269 --> 55:15.770
You wanna keep selling,

55:15.812 --> 55:17.188
gotta move east
a little bit,

55:17.230 --> 55:19.024
over by the Five-Star
Check Cashing.

55:19.065 --> 55:20.608
We don't roll through there
much.

55:20.650 --> 55:23.737
All that I need

55:23.778 --> 55:25.739
Thank you...

55:25.780 --> 55:27.032
Officer Gallagher.

55:27.073 --> 55:29.200
And everyone agrees

55:29.242 --> 55:32.120
She's got it goin' on

55:32.162 --> 55:35.206
She's got it goin' o-on

55:35.248 --> 55:37.876
She can do no wrong

55:37.917 --> 55:40.003
'Cause she's got it
goin' on

Come on! Come on!
