WEBVTT

00:03.367 --> 00:04.900
Wait. Who owned the house?

00:07.633 --> 00:09.533
The first
New York state executioner.

00:12.167 --> 00:13.667
The inventor
of the electric chair.

00:17.000 --> 00:19.067
What?
I thought it said, "Help me."

00:20.733 --> 00:23.600
What was that?
There is something going on.

00:23.600 --> 00:25.033
Maybe it said, "Punish me."

00:27.867 --> 00:29.700
I'm, like, so mad.

00:33.167 --> 00:35.233
I'm Amy Bruni.

00:35.233 --> 00:37.900
I was only 8
when a paranormal incident

00:37.900 --> 00:39.500
changed my life forever.

00:40.600 --> 00:43.000
Since then,
I've dedicated my time

00:43.000 --> 00:46.800
to solving the most terrifying
hauntings imaginable.

00:46.800 --> 00:48.267
I'm Adam Berry.

00:48.267 --> 00:50.833
More than a decade ago,
an encounter at Gettysburg

00:50.833 --> 00:53.233
rocked my beliefs
about the supernatural.

00:53.233 --> 00:55.333
Together,
we uncover the truth

00:55.333 --> 00:56.967
behind the unexplainable.

00:56.967 --> 00:58.600
Oh. Oh, my god.

00:58.600 --> 01:01.800
Now we are on
our most important mission yet.

01:03.433 --> 01:05.700
Helping families
overcome their fear,

01:05.700 --> 01:10.067
take back their homes,
and reclaim their lives.

01:10.067 --> 01:13.067
synced by dom.smrc

01:21.333 --> 01:23.900
So, this case is about
a guy named Jason,

01:23.900 --> 01:27.267
and he is completely
terrified of his own house.

01:27.267 --> 01:31.900
He think this place
has a demonic force in it.

01:31.900 --> 01:33.900
I want you to watch...
Let's watch this video.

01:33.900 --> 01:37.600
Here.
Let me take a look at this.

01:37.600 --> 01:39.833
He was trying to do
some paranormal investigating

01:39.833 --> 01:42.167
with his friends,
and he had a terrible accident.

01:42.167 --> 01:44.467
He fell down a set of stairs,
or he was pushed.

01:44.467 --> 01:45.633
He has no idea.

01:45.633 --> 01:47.067
One minute,
he was going through a door,

01:47.067 --> 01:49.333
and the next,
he was, like, on the ground.

01:49.333 --> 01:51.067
Oh! Whoa!

01:52.567 --> 01:54.967
Oh!

01:54.967 --> 01:56.733
How bad is it?

01:56.733 --> 01:58.967
Just a little scrape
over here...

01:58.967 --> 02:00.067
All right... On the nose.

02:02.600 --> 02:03.800
<i>Yeah, I'm all right.</i>

02:05.367 --> 02:06.733
Oh! Whoa!

02:08.667 --> 02:11.100
Oh!

02:11.100 --> 02:12.833
<i>How bad is it?</i>

02:12.833 --> 02:15.100
<i>Just a little scrape
over here...</i>

02:15.100 --> 02:16.433
<i>All right... On the nose.</i>

02:16.433 --> 02:18.300
He's been experiencing
activity for years,

02:18.300 --> 02:20.100
but it's never this violent.

02:20.100 --> 02:22.600
So, have you talked
to Jason at all?

02:22.600 --> 02:25.433
What's his story?
Jason is an engineer.

02:25.433 --> 02:27.067
Mm-hmm. He is very logical.

02:27.067 --> 02:28.467
So when things happen
in his house,

02:28.467 --> 02:30.933
he tries to figure out
why they're happening, right?

02:30.933 --> 02:32.633
Right.
But he can't figure it out.

02:32.633 --> 02:34.867
It's really spiraled
out of control,

02:34.867 --> 02:36.833
and that is why we need
to get to his house.

02:36.833 --> 02:38.567
Okay.

02:43.067 --> 02:45.100
Anytime someone believes
they're attacked,

02:45.100 --> 02:47.733
we take it very seriously.

02:47.733 --> 02:50.367
If Jason was really pushed down
a flight of stairs,

02:50.367 --> 02:52.567
this could be
our most dangerous case yet.

02:52.567 --> 02:53.733
Mm.

02:53.733 --> 02:56.800
How long have you
lived in the house?

02:56.800 --> 02:58.300
About five years. Okay.

02:58.300 --> 03:00.567
And then how long has activity
been going on in the house?

03:00.567 --> 03:01.667
Five years.

03:01.667 --> 03:02.933
Okay, so, as soon
as you moved in.

03:02.933 --> 03:04.833
Yeah. I think
it was about a month and a half

03:04.833 --> 03:05.967
after I moved in,

03:05.967 --> 03:08.100
we were playing
a poker game back here,

03:08.100 --> 03:10.667
and I was telling the story
about how I found out

03:10.667 --> 03:12.267
it was the executioner's house

03:12.267 --> 03:13.800
and all the lights
in the house dimmed down

03:13.800 --> 03:17.067
and hovered there
for probably 30 seconds.

03:17.067 --> 03:20.500
Wait. Who owned the house first?

03:20.500 --> 03:22.600
Yeah, the first
New York state executioner.

03:22.600 --> 03:24.500
He was the inventor
of the electric chair.

03:24.500 --> 03:26.500
Owned this house?
He built it and owned it,

03:26.500 --> 03:28.867
and he's buried
out back in the cemetery.

03:31.567 --> 03:33.900
About 100 yards
over the hill here.

03:33.900 --> 03:36.500
So, the first
New York state executioner,

03:36.500 --> 03:37.667
and what was his name?

03:37.667 --> 03:40.167
Edwin F. Davis.

03:40.167 --> 03:42.067
Okay.

03:42.067 --> 03:45.133
Aside from that,
any other experiences?

03:45.133 --> 03:47.233
I heard screaming
coming from the basement.

03:47.233 --> 03:48.867
Okay. Very loud screaming.

03:48.867 --> 03:50.367
Like, it sounded like
a woman screaming.

03:50.367 --> 03:52.733
And I didn't know what it was,

03:52.733 --> 03:54.200
and I basically turned the TV up

03:54.200 --> 03:55.500
as loud as I could
to drown it out.

03:55.500 --> 03:56.567
Geez.

03:56.567 --> 03:58.133
You didn't get up
and go and check?

03:58.133 --> 04:00.367
No. No, no.

04:00.367 --> 04:03.067
Not too long after that,
I was sleeping on the couch,

04:03.067 --> 04:05.067
because, like, when I go
upstairs in the bedroom,

04:05.067 --> 04:06.867
you just get
this very negative feeling

04:06.867 --> 04:08.133
like you're being watched,

04:08.133 --> 04:10.567
so I started sleeping
on the couch down here.

04:10.567 --> 04:12.867
You sleep here every night?
Correct. Yes.

04:12.867 --> 04:15.567
And how long have you been
sleeping on the couch?

04:15.567 --> 04:18.767
It started a couple months
after I moved in, so...

04:18.767 --> 04:20.632
And so you don't even sleep
in your own bed at night?

04:20.632 --> 04:22.900
No. Wow.

04:22.900 --> 04:25.833
Okay.

04:25.833 --> 04:27.600
All right,
so, this is your bedroom?

04:27.600 --> 04:30.267
Yeah. This is what was
gonna be my bedroom.

04:30.267 --> 04:31.933
This is kind of here for show.

04:31.933 --> 04:34.467
The closet over here,
it always felt like something's

04:34.467 --> 04:36.400
in there,
staring out at you, and...

04:36.400 --> 04:39.467
You won't even look at it.
No, I don't.

04:39.467 --> 04:41.233
And, actually,
before you guys come,

04:41.233 --> 04:43.267
I was keeping my clothes
downstairs, too, so...

04:43.267 --> 04:45.667
They're usually downstairs?
Yeah. I don't...

04:45.667 --> 04:47.633
You don't come up here at all?
No.

04:47.633 --> 04:48.900
I leave all these doors shut,

04:48.900 --> 04:50.300
and I leave
the landing doors shut.

04:50.300 --> 04:52.833
I come up here to use
the shower and bathroom.

04:52.833 --> 04:55.200
And that's it?
That's about it.

04:55.200 --> 04:56.667
Okay.

05:03.933 --> 05:05.800
Are these the stairs
you fell down?

05:05.800 --> 05:07.067
Yeah.
Right where you're standing.

05:07.067 --> 05:08.400
So that door you tried
to open up.

05:08.400 --> 05:09.933
Oh! Whoa!

05:11.633 --> 05:15.100
Oh!

05:15.100 --> 05:17.267
What were your injuries?
So, basically, I hit my face.

05:17.267 --> 05:19.700
There's still a little scar
on one side here to the other.

05:19.700 --> 05:22.700
And, basically, bloody nose.

05:22.700 --> 05:26.233
Now, you were investigating
with friends, right?

05:26.233 --> 05:28.300
Yeah. Chris was
back here at the time,

05:28.300 --> 05:29.667
so he comes running over. Oh.

05:29.667 --> 05:32.067
He's like, "You all right?"
I'm like, "I'm good.

05:32.067 --> 05:34.067
"Just don't touch me." And, you
know, blood's dripping out

05:34.067 --> 05:37.900
of my nose and stuff
onto the floor.

05:37.900 --> 05:41.067
Were... do you think you were
pushed, or did you slip?

05:41.067 --> 05:43.067
I don't think I tripped. Right.

05:43.067 --> 05:45.067
You know, every time
I fell and tripped,

05:45.067 --> 05:47.567
I know I did it,
and I know it's coming.

05:47.567 --> 05:48.967
This was, like...

05:48.967 --> 05:50.800
Just gone.

05:55.667 --> 05:57.200
Who do you think it is?

05:57.200 --> 06:00.967
I feel like
it's a demonic entity.

06:00.967 --> 06:03.367
"Demonic" is a very
strong word for us.

06:03.367 --> 06:04.700
I would say, so far,

06:04.700 --> 06:07.567
I'm not getting anything
that would make me think demon.

06:07.567 --> 06:09.967
Okay. That's good to know.
So, but... so far.

06:09.967 --> 06:11.633
I'm just terrified
that something bad's

06:11.633 --> 06:12.700
gonna happen to me.

06:12.700 --> 06:14.967
You are experiencing
extreme activity,

06:14.967 --> 06:19.233
but we're gonna do
everything we can to help you.

06:19.233 --> 06:21.733
Now, I'm guessing these are
the deeds to the house.

06:21.733 --> 06:22.767
Is that... Yeah, correct.

06:22.767 --> 06:24.133
But these are,
like, the originals.

06:24.133 --> 06:27.067
Yeah, that's from when
the house was built till now.

06:27.067 --> 06:28.233
Wow.

06:28.233 --> 06:30.400
The will of the executioner's
in there.

06:30.400 --> 06:31.833
Really? Yeah.

06:31.833 --> 06:34.067
Have you heard anything else
about Edwin Davis?

06:34.067 --> 06:37.167
So, down the road, there's
the village inn tavern.

06:37.167 --> 06:39.633
I guess on the third floor
was his workshop.

06:39.633 --> 06:40.767
That's local legend.

06:40.767 --> 06:42.367
Oh, okay. Yeah.

06:42.367 --> 06:44.167
So we're definitely
gonna check that out.

06:44.167 --> 06:46.467
Now, what do you know about
the former homeowners?

06:46.467 --> 06:49.100
Did you ask them if they ever
had any activity here?

06:49.100 --> 06:51.100
That's what creeps me out
the most.

06:51.100 --> 06:52.700
They're like, "No, not
anything I can remember."

06:52.700 --> 06:54.067
Really?

06:54.067 --> 06:56.133
And I'm like, "I don't know why
this stuff's happening to me."

06:56.133 --> 06:58.867
I just want to go upstairs
and go to fricking bed, and...

06:58.867 --> 07:02.467
I got you guys in here now
and all this stuff.

07:02.467 --> 07:03.933
You just want to enjoy
your house, basically.

07:03.933 --> 07:05.500
I just want to, like,
"Go to sleep

07:05.500 --> 07:07.067
"and be happy" kind of thing,
you know?

07:07.067 --> 07:08.067
And it's like...

07:08.067 --> 07:11.867
Jason is
legitimately freaked out.

07:11.867 --> 07:13.867
He's terrified.

07:13.867 --> 07:16.700
To help him, first, we're gonna
look into this executioner,

07:16.700 --> 07:17.800
Edwin Davis.

07:17.800 --> 07:19.067
The fact that he lived here

07:19.067 --> 07:21.067
and put people to death
for a living

07:21.067 --> 07:24.267
makes him a perfect candidate
for who's causing the activity.

07:26.467 --> 07:28.067
I'm meeting a gentleman
named Larry,

07:28.067 --> 07:31.967
and he owns a bar that used
to be Edwin Davis' workshop.

07:31.967 --> 07:33.933
I'm gonna go talk to him
and see if I can find out

07:33.933 --> 07:38.067
any historical information
about Edwin Davis and this area.

07:38.067 --> 07:40.500
No. Okay.

07:40.500 --> 07:43.167
So, how long
have you owned this?

07:43.167 --> 07:44.567
44 years.

07:44.567 --> 07:46.200
You've owned this for 44 years?

07:46.200 --> 07:47.267
Yeah.

07:47.267 --> 07:48.867
And who owned it beforehand?

07:48.867 --> 07:52.400
My grandfather bought it
in 1921 from Edwin Davis,

07:52.400 --> 07:53.667
and he built the place.

07:53.667 --> 07:54.933
It wasn't a bar
and a restaurant.

07:54.933 --> 07:57.700
Oh, no, no. It was a feed mill.

07:57.700 --> 07:59.500
Do you remember it that way?

07:59.500 --> 08:02.767
Like, you remember it
when it was set up like that?

08:02.767 --> 08:06.433
Yes. In fact, within 5 feet
somewhere here,

08:06.433 --> 08:07.667
there was a room,

08:07.667 --> 08:12.267
and in the room,
it had two electric chairs.

08:12.267 --> 08:15.100
Oh.

08:15.100 --> 08:17.833
And there were leather straps

08:17.833 --> 08:20.367
so you could tie
the person down.

08:20.367 --> 08:22.300
For sure.

08:22.300 --> 08:23.667
He was building them here?

08:23.667 --> 08:26.533
He actually perfected it
in this building.

08:26.533 --> 08:27.533
Wow.

08:27.533 --> 08:30.600
He would take the train
up to Auburn

08:30.600 --> 08:34.299
and pull the switch on criminals

08:34.299 --> 08:37.232
or whatever
that were found guilty.

08:37.232 --> 08:39.832
After talking with Larry,
it's clear that Edwin Davis

08:39.832 --> 08:42.366
is going to be a big part
of this investigation.

08:42.366 --> 08:45.400
Edwin, you know, he executed
a lot of people,

08:45.400 --> 08:47.900
so there's a lot of darkness
that comes with that.

08:51.467 --> 08:53.500
Since Jason
is experiencing activity

08:53.500 --> 08:55.100
in just about every room,

08:55.100 --> 08:57.300
we'll blanket the house
with our DVR cameras.

09:01.600 --> 09:03.500
One in the basement,
two upstairs,

09:03.500 --> 09:05.333
one in the living room,
one on the stairs.

09:05.333 --> 09:06.800
Yeah. Okay.

09:06.800 --> 09:09.467
So, what's this new piece
of equipment that you have?

09:09.467 --> 09:13.767
Okay, so, basically,
these are microphones.

09:13.767 --> 09:16.133
In a nutshell,
you wear these in your ear,

09:16.133 --> 09:17.433
right and left. Right.

09:17.433 --> 09:19.533
And it's hooked to a recorder.
Okay.

09:19.533 --> 09:22.500
So, it records 360 sound.

09:22.500 --> 09:25.967
So, basically, when we listen
to anything recorded on that,

09:25.967 --> 09:27.700
you can tell exactly where
in the room

09:27.700 --> 09:29.100
the sound was coming from.
Yes. Yeah.

09:29.100 --> 09:32.067
Cool. Let's go ahead...
Let's start in the living room.

09:35.600 --> 09:36.933
So, I hear the fridge.

09:36.933 --> 09:40.800
The fridge is pretty loud.

09:40.800 --> 09:44.267
And so whatever he's hearing
has to be pretty substantial

09:44.267 --> 09:46.367
if he's hearing it
over that fridge.

09:51.667 --> 09:54.300
Can you make yourself known?

09:56.300 --> 09:58.067
What's your name?

10:02.833 --> 10:05.200
Did you grow up in Corning?

10:07.000 --> 10:13.074

10:18.367 --> 10:20.467
<i>Did you grow up in Corn...</i>
Two syllables.

10:47.800 --> 10:50.433
<i>Did you grow up in corn...</i>
Two syllables.

10:55.800 --> 10:57.767
Yeah.

10:57.767 --> 10:59.533
Did that sound
like Edwin to you?

11:03.633 --> 11:04.800
<i>Did you grow up in Corning?</i>

11:04.800 --> 11:05.900
A little.

11:05.900 --> 11:07.433
I mean,
it's, like, so fast, but...

11:07.433 --> 11:09.200
No, I don't know.
I mean, that's...

11:09.200 --> 11:11.067
Something's responding,
but I don't know what it says.

11:11.067 --> 11:13.200
I mean, I can't...
It's very quiet.

11:13.200 --> 11:15.700
But here's the thing.

11:15.700 --> 11:19.433
He's had this really
extreme activity,

11:19.433 --> 11:20.967
so you'd think that
whatever is here

11:20.967 --> 11:23.567
would be a lot more eager
to talk to us.

11:23.567 --> 11:26.733
Yeah. Where are all the noises
Jason talked about?

11:26.733 --> 11:31.067
I mean, honestly, this house
is making zero noise.

11:31.067 --> 11:34.600
You know, most old houses, they
at least creak or something.

11:34.600 --> 11:36.700
It makes no sense.

11:36.700 --> 11:38.367
Jason believes
whatever's here is demonic

11:38.367 --> 11:40.533
and may have pushed him
down the stairs.

11:40.533 --> 11:43.067
I mean, what did he do
that brought that out,

11:43.067 --> 11:44.867
that he brought these...
Was it Chris?

11:44.867 --> 11:46.733
I'm interested
in interviewing Chris.

11:46.733 --> 11:49.267
He was here investigating
the night Jason fell.

11:49.267 --> 11:51.667
I want to see what other
evidence he may have caught.

11:51.667 --> 11:53.067
I wouldn't mind sitting down

11:53.067 --> 11:55.100
and interviewing Jason,
to be honest.

11:55.100 --> 11:57.367
I feel like there's
a lot more there besides...

11:57.367 --> 11:59.667
Outside of just his experiences.

11:59.667 --> 12:00.833
So let's do that.

12:00.833 --> 12:03.133
We have the cameras
running all night.

12:03.133 --> 12:05.533
Let's leave some recorders
running all night

12:05.533 --> 12:08.133
and see what happens.

12:08.133 --> 12:10.767
In our opinion,
inexperienced investigators

12:10.767 --> 12:13.733
can sometimes cause
more damage than good,

12:13.733 --> 12:15.300
so we're gonna sit down
with Jason and Chris

12:15.300 --> 12:17.567
to find out more about
their investigations.

12:17.567 --> 12:20.333
Chris, thank you
for joining me today

12:20.333 --> 12:23.333
in Jason's house,
which I know you know well.

12:23.333 --> 12:25.200
You've been here many times
with your family.

12:25.200 --> 12:26.967
Yep. Especially investigating.

12:26.967 --> 12:30.167
So, how do you feel about
Jason and his situation?

12:30.167 --> 12:33.267
So, when I came over here
and realized

12:33.267 --> 12:36.533
that he's been sleeping
downstairs on his couch

12:36.533 --> 12:38.700
and that's been going on
for quite some time,

12:38.700 --> 12:40.433
I became really
concerned about it.

12:40.433 --> 12:42.733
Right.
So, you began investigating,

12:42.733 --> 12:44.700
and you started having
experiences, right?

12:44.700 --> 12:45.800
Yes. Right, okay.

12:45.800 --> 12:47.700
Tell me about this clip.

12:47.700 --> 12:49.600
So, in this audio clip,

12:49.600 --> 12:52.467
it was my son Brandon and I
and Jason.

12:52.467 --> 12:54.533
We were down in the basement
when this was recorded.

12:54.533 --> 12:55.567
Okay.

13:01.400 --> 13:02.967
<i>Do you want us
to play it back to hear...</i>

13:02.967 --> 13:04.400
You're asking...

13:04.400 --> 13:07.233
Brandon was asking a question.
Okay.

13:12.267 --> 13:13.967
<i>Do you want us
to play it back to hear...</i>

13:13.967 --> 13:16.067
What do you think it's saying?

13:16.067 --> 13:18.067
<i>Do you want us
to play it back to hear...</i>

13:18.067 --> 13:19.333
<i>You wanted me to record this.</i>
I'm not...

13:19.333 --> 13:22.467
I thought
maybe it said, "Punish me."

13:22.467 --> 13:25.067
Okay.

13:26.533 --> 13:28.167
I mean, yeah. I can hear that.

13:28.167 --> 13:30.467
I can hear that.
I mean, it's a weird one.

13:30.467 --> 13:33.833
I'm gonna have to show Amy,
and we'll discuss them.

13:36.067 --> 13:37.933
Chris does have
a potential piece of evidence,

13:37.933 --> 13:40.200
but unless Amy and I are
in the room when it's recorded,

13:40.200 --> 13:42.933
it's hard to say
if it's legitimate or not.

13:45.933 --> 13:48.600
Let me play you
a couple of these things

13:48.600 --> 13:50.800
that Chris had. Oh, yeah.

13:50.800 --> 13:52.600
I've been wanting to hear this.
Right?

13:52.600 --> 13:54.933
This one, they think
it says, "Punish me,"

13:54.933 --> 13:57.733
but I asked
for the non-edited file.

13:57.733 --> 13:59.067
So, now I've listened
to it more,

13:59.067 --> 14:02.067
and I want you
to hear this thing.

14:02.067 --> 14:03.967
<i>Why would we leave</i>

14:03.967 --> 14:07.067
<i>unless we knew
that you were here?</i>

14:07.067 --> 14:09.067
<i>Sure, there's
a couple red spikes.</i>

14:09.067 --> 14:10.667
He's very aggressive. Oh, god.

14:10.667 --> 14:12.300
He's so aggressive.
They're not nice.

14:12.300 --> 14:13.967
He's not... the kid.
Is this the kid?

14:13.967 --> 14:15.100
Yeah. <i>If this is you,</i>

14:15.100 --> 14:17.200
<i>if this is whatever your name...</i>

14:17.200 --> 14:19.067
<i>You wanted me to record this.</i>

14:19.067 --> 14:20.400
<i>Now, what do you want to say?</i>

14:22.233 --> 14:24.067
You know what that is, right?
Yeah. Oh, yeah.

14:24.067 --> 14:25.533
<i>You wanted me to record this.</i>

14:25.533 --> 14:27.867
<i>Now, what do you want to say?</i>

14:27.867 --> 14:29.567
Yeah, no, it's like... it is.

14:29.567 --> 14:31.267
It's a coat or...
It's a coat or a jacket.

14:31.267 --> 14:32.533
...somebody exhaling or...

14:32.533 --> 14:33.733
Right. Yeah, it's not...

14:33.733 --> 14:36.800
Oh, these guys. Wow.

14:36.800 --> 14:39.367
This aggressive
investigating could be

14:39.367 --> 14:42.133
the reason Edwin
or whoever is here

14:42.133 --> 14:45.400
is causing the activity.

14:45.400 --> 14:49.067
How long did you experience
the activity in the house

14:50.633 --> 14:51.833
before Chris came in
and started trying to help you?

14:51.833 --> 14:54.100
Yeah, so, he came in
this year, basically,

14:54.100 --> 14:56.767
and I've had it
since I moved in.

14:56.767 --> 14:59.067
But it was, like,
a three-times-a-year event.

14:59.067 --> 15:03.267
And then when he came over,
it was every night.

15:03.267 --> 15:06.467
So, you think his investigating
kind of riled things up here?

15:06.467 --> 15:08.433
Yeah. I call it, like,
poking the beast,

15:08.433 --> 15:09.767
that kind of thing.

15:09.767 --> 15:13.200
So, I mean, he seems like he's
having a good time with this.

15:13.200 --> 15:14.733
That bothers me a lot, actually.

15:14.733 --> 15:15.767
Yeah.

15:15.767 --> 15:18.067
'Cause he's all excited
and stuff,

15:18.067 --> 15:20.067
and I'm like,
"Something's not right here."

15:20.067 --> 15:24.167
I just don't want something
demonic in the house.

15:24.167 --> 15:26.467
One of my best friends
is a demonologist,

15:26.467 --> 15:27.767
and what I've seen

15:27.767 --> 15:31.067
is that demons
and negative-type attachments

15:31.067 --> 15:34.667
are attracted to people
who are compromised,

15:34.667 --> 15:36.267
usually psychologically.

15:36.267 --> 15:37.333
Drug addicts. Mm-hmm.

15:37.333 --> 15:39.267
They're in a place
where they have

15:39.267 --> 15:41.200
to literally invite
this thing in,

15:41.200 --> 15:44.067
where they say, "Yes,
you can take me," basically.

15:44.067 --> 15:46.600
And I don't think
that whatever's here

15:46.600 --> 15:49.833
is something along those lines.

15:49.833 --> 15:54.733
Now, I wanted to ask, though,
if you would investigate with us

15:54.733 --> 15:55.800
a little bit tonight.

15:58.700 --> 16:00.767
Yeah, I can... Okay, yeah.

16:00.767 --> 16:04.633
Because I think, since you
have most of the experiences,

16:04.633 --> 16:06.333
maybe if you're here with us,

16:06.333 --> 16:08.433
you could act
as kind of a catalyst.

16:08.433 --> 16:10.133
Okay. Yeah, that's fine.

16:10.133 --> 16:12.533
What's the scariest place
for you in the house?

16:12.533 --> 16:14.200
Usually upstairs.

16:25.933 --> 16:29.533
Is there someone
who wants to talk to us?

16:31.367 --> 16:33.233
We have Jason here.

16:38.933 --> 16:41.167
If you're not Edwin,

16:41.167 --> 16:45.133
what is your name?

16:45.133 --> 16:47.367
Did you grow up
in this house?

16:52.867 --> 16:55.067
Jason, ask a question.

16:55.067 --> 16:57.933
Did you die in this house?

16:57.933 --> 16:59.733
Was someone murdered here?

17:02.400 --> 17:05.067
Are you a woman?

17:05.067 --> 17:06.800
Is this your bedroom?

17:26.867 --> 17:28.233
That was an answer.

17:28.233 --> 17:29.533
That was something.

17:40.067 --> 17:42.467
Something's talking.
Something is talking.

17:45.767 --> 17:48.100
What?
I thought it said, "Help me."

17:59.167 --> 18:02.167
- Something's talking.
- Something is talking.

18:05.167 --> 18:07.533
What?
I thought it said, "Help me."

18:12.100 --> 18:14.833
I think it says, "Help me," too.

18:16.567 --> 18:18.233
"Help me."

18:18.233 --> 18:20.433
Can you play
the first one again?

18:24.800 --> 18:26.100
A woman. A woman. Yeah.

18:26.100 --> 18:27.300
A woman.
That's what it sounds like.

18:30.367 --> 18:32.200
I hear, "A woman."

18:32.200 --> 18:33.200
"Are you a woman?"

18:33.200 --> 18:34.400
"A woman." "A woman."

18:34.400 --> 18:36.167
And then,
"Is this your bedroom?"

18:36.167 --> 18:37.667
"Help me." "Help me."

18:37.667 --> 18:40.833
"A woman."

18:40.833 --> 18:45.067
So, have you felt like
it was a female here before?

18:45.067 --> 18:48.600
Uh, so, that's the voice
we catch most.

18:48.600 --> 18:51.633
That's interesting.

18:51.633 --> 18:53.600
Well, we're getting responses,
so let's keep going.

18:53.600 --> 18:57.067
We hear that you're a woman.

18:57.067 --> 19:00.067
Is that correct?

19:02.567 --> 19:04.600
We also heard you ask for help.

19:04.600 --> 19:06.500
How can we help you?

19:17.933 --> 19:19.933
Did you hear that? Yeah.

19:19.933 --> 19:21.800
You heard that?
Yeah, that was a woman.

19:21.800 --> 19:23.867
It was a female voice.
Yeah, down the hallway.

19:23.867 --> 19:24.867
Yeah.

19:28.133 --> 19:29.667
It happens a lot here.

19:29.667 --> 19:31.067
Is it the same voice you hear?

19:31.067 --> 19:32.133
Roughly, yeah. Really?

19:32.133 --> 19:34.133
But sometimes it's a lot louder.

19:34.133 --> 19:35.833
Really?

19:35.833 --> 19:38.667
Have your friends ever
investigated here without you?

19:38.667 --> 19:40.600
No.

19:40.600 --> 19:42.067
Hmm.

19:44.100 --> 19:46.967
Uh, so,
we want to ask you a favor.

19:46.967 --> 19:48.467
Do you mind leaving the house?

19:48.467 --> 19:50.133
And we'll continue investigating

19:50.133 --> 19:52.567
and see if activity continues
without you here?

19:52.567 --> 19:54.100
Okay. Awesome.

19:54.100 --> 19:57.800
Yep. All right.

19:57.800 --> 20:00.700
It's really important to see
if we can experience activity

20:00.700 --> 20:03.067
without Jason, just to be sure

20:03.067 --> 20:06.567
this is not some negative entity
that's attached to him.

20:06.567 --> 20:10.233
There is something going on.

20:10.233 --> 20:11.533
Right. It says, "Help me."

20:11.533 --> 20:13.833
And it says, "A woman."

20:13.833 --> 20:15.200
But the thing that gets me

20:15.200 --> 20:16.700
is, like,
that disembodied voice.

20:16.700 --> 20:18.600
Like, there was definitely
a disembodied voice

20:18.600 --> 20:19.733
in that hallway.

20:19.733 --> 20:20.867
And it was a female.

20:20.867 --> 20:22.000
That was very clear.

20:22.000 --> 20:23.967
Right. And he was just like,

20:23.967 --> 20:25.400
"That's the voice
I hear all the time,"

20:25.400 --> 20:27.200
and I'm thinking, "My god",

20:27.200 --> 20:29.033
you're just living here
with this thing."

20:29.033 --> 20:31.567
Of course you're scared.

20:31.567 --> 20:33.767
But I feel like we should
probably move downstairs,

20:33.767 --> 20:36.100
where he said he hears
the voice the most

20:36.100 --> 20:41.400
and try to talk to it
some more without him here.

20:41.400 --> 20:44.533
Would you be okay if I sat
at the top of the stairs?

20:44.533 --> 20:47.000
Because I would be able to hear

20:47.000 --> 20:48.600
if there's any activity up here.

20:48.600 --> 20:49.933
Yeah.

20:55.000 --> 20:56.867
Is that you moving around
up there, Adam?

20:56.867 --> 21:00.467
You mean, like, shuffling? Yeah.

21:00.467 --> 21:01.733
Like, I'm moving my jacket.

21:01.733 --> 21:05.600
Uh... no.

21:05.600 --> 21:06.967
Like walk... like this?

21:06.967 --> 21:09.567
Like, I'll do it again.
Like this?

21:09.567 --> 21:11.500
No.

21:12.567 --> 21:15.733
I didn't hear anything else.

21:15.733 --> 21:17.467
If there's someone
moving around upstairs,

21:17.467 --> 21:19.233
can you do that again?

21:26.233 --> 21:27.667
On the count of 3,

21:27.667 --> 21:31.233
do something really,
really loud.

21:33.467 --> 21:37.167
1...

21:37.167 --> 21:40.500
2...

21:40.500 --> 21:42.500
3.

21:50.233 --> 21:53.067
That!

21:53.067 --> 21:54.767
I have no idea what that is.

21:54.767 --> 21:55.833
Is that upstairs?

21:55.833 --> 21:58.367
No.
I hear it like it's upstairs.

21:58.367 --> 22:00.200
I hear it like it's downstairs.

22:00.200 --> 22:01.300
Weird.

22:03.800 --> 22:06.533
Huh.

22:06.533 --> 22:07.633
All right.

22:09.667 --> 22:12.267
We're still getting activity,
so that means...

22:12.267 --> 22:13.967
Yeah. So it'll happen
when he's not here.

22:13.967 --> 22:15.900
Yeah.

22:15.900 --> 22:17.700
We have a lot of research
to do tomorrow.

22:17.700 --> 22:19.067
This woman. Who is this woman?

22:19.067 --> 22:20.833
And why would
there be a woman in here?

22:20.833 --> 22:22.200
Yeah.

22:22.200 --> 22:25.467
Last night's activity
is pointing us toward a female.

22:25.467 --> 22:27.267
We're going to focus
our research on women

22:27.267 --> 22:32.300
who are connected to either
the property or to Edwin Davis.

22:32.300 --> 22:35.200
Adam will speak to an author
and expert on Edwin Davis

22:35.200 --> 22:36.733
just to see
if there's any connection

22:36.733 --> 22:38.967
between the executioner
and this woman.

22:38.967 --> 22:41.700
What was her name?

22:41.700 --> 22:43.067
Okay.

22:43.067 --> 22:45.167
And I'm going to talk
to a local historian

22:45.167 --> 22:46.567
about this part of New York.

22:46.567 --> 22:50.833
Can you think of any...just
tragic events that happened in town?

22:50.833 --> 22:54.967
We're meeting up at Edwin Davis'
grave to share our findings.

22:54.967 --> 22:58.067
So, I went to the historical
society, but had zero luck.

22:58.067 --> 23:00.300
I still have to take a look
at the deeds, though.

23:00.300 --> 23:01.800
Did you find anything?

23:01.800 --> 23:04.567
I talked to an author
named Robert today.

23:04.567 --> 23:07.400
He told me about a woman
named Martha Place,

23:07.400 --> 23:09.333
the first woman to ever die
in the electric chair,

23:09.333 --> 23:13.067
and Edwin Davis
pulled the switch.

23:13.067 --> 23:15.067
She wasn't a nice person.

23:15.067 --> 23:18.767
She had an extremely
aggressive temper.

23:18.767 --> 23:22.467
She married this man
who had a daughter already,

23:22.467 --> 23:23.567
and it was her stepdaughter,

23:23.567 --> 23:25.100
and she threw acid
in her face...

23:25.100 --> 23:26.367
Oh.

23:26.367 --> 23:28.733
...and then smothered her
with a pillow and killed her

23:28.733 --> 23:32.100
and then went after
her husband with an ax.

23:32.100 --> 23:34.367
And I know that, like,
last night, we heard, like...

23:34.367 --> 23:35.633
A female voice.

23:35.633 --> 23:36.900
Yeah. Like, "Help me."

23:36.900 --> 23:40.233
So, I mean, we obviously try
to reach out to Martha.

23:40.233 --> 23:41.767
Yeah, for sure.

23:44.167 --> 23:45.967
I'll get the equipment ready.

23:48.100 --> 23:51.167
Amy, come check this out.

23:51.167 --> 23:53.833
So, I was reviewing
the 360 recorder.

23:53.833 --> 23:54.933
I mean, nothing on that,

23:54.933 --> 23:57.100
but I did get something
on the DVR.

23:57.100 --> 24:00.767
You know, we've ran this
two consecutive nights now.

24:00.767 --> 24:02.133
You know, we have
those motion sensors.

24:02.133 --> 24:03.433
We know when
something's in there.

24:03.433 --> 24:05.633
We know when something's
coming through the space.

24:05.633 --> 24:06.867
Here.

24:12.767 --> 24:14.767
What was that?

24:23.500 --> 24:27.367
You know, we've ran this
two consecutive nights now.

24:27.367 --> 24:28.800
You know, we have
those motion sensors.

24:28.800 --> 24:30.100
We know when
something's in there.

24:30.100 --> 24:31.933
We know when something's
coming through the space.

24:31.933 --> 24:33.500
Here.

24:40.567 --> 24:42.067
What was that?

24:43.467 --> 24:47.800
Something starts to manifest
like it's going down the stairs.

24:47.800 --> 24:48.933
See it come? Yes.

24:48.933 --> 24:51.233
And it goes down the stairs.
Now, is it a glitch?

24:51.233 --> 24:52.433
Let's look at it, right?

24:52.433 --> 24:54.400
If you look at the 24-hour Mark,

24:54.400 --> 24:58.233
there is nothing happening
in this space...

24:58.233 --> 25:00.233
Until that point.
...Until that moment.

25:00.233 --> 25:02.800
There is something there
walking down the stairs.

25:02.800 --> 25:03.767
Well, do it again.

25:06.933 --> 25:08.833
Who the hell is moving around?

25:08.833 --> 25:10.667
I'm gonna go find out.

25:23.367 --> 25:26.533
Is your name Martha?

25:26.533 --> 25:29.433
The man who lives here, Jason...

25:29.433 --> 25:33.367
He said he heard screaming
from down here.

25:33.367 --> 25:34.700
Was that you?

25:38.767 --> 25:42.200
Did you die
by the electric chair?

25:44.267 --> 25:49.067
Do you hold Edwin Davis
responsible?

25:49.067 --> 25:51.600
Let's take a listen.

26:05.233 --> 26:06.900
Nothing.

26:06.900 --> 26:08.067
Maybe we need to go back

26:08.067 --> 26:09.467
to a central location.
Yeah, upstairs.

26:09.467 --> 26:11.167
It's everywhere we're not
at this point.

26:11.167 --> 26:14.600
I say we get upstairs
to where he hears it.

26:14.600 --> 26:17.100
If it's not Martha, who is it?

26:17.100 --> 26:18.567
I have an idea.

26:18.567 --> 26:20.500
I want to look at the deeds.

26:27.500 --> 26:29.633
Oh, my goodness.

26:29.633 --> 26:33.200
I think I found something
that makes a lot of sense.

26:33.200 --> 26:34.467
What?

26:34.467 --> 26:37.500
So, I was going through
the deeds, right?

26:37.500 --> 26:39.100
And I was getting
the names of the people

26:39.100 --> 26:40.667
who lived here before.

26:40.667 --> 26:43.867
Now, remember, Jason asked
the previous owner

26:43.867 --> 26:45.467
if they had activity here,
right?

26:45.467 --> 26:47.133
Right. And what did they say?

26:47.133 --> 26:49.700
They said... No. No.

26:49.700 --> 26:51.433
They had not had
any activity here.

26:51.433 --> 26:53.100
The people who owned the house,

26:53.100 --> 26:55.300
they bought it in 1965.

26:55.300 --> 26:59.100
Their names were
Edward and Marjorie Mayor.

26:59.100 --> 27:01.467
Marjorie went by Marg or Margie.

27:01.467 --> 27:07.733
She died right before Jason
bought the house.

27:07.733 --> 27:11.867
And I'm just wondering
if this is her

27:11.867 --> 27:14.767
that we're dealing with.

27:14.767 --> 27:16.533
And I was reading
through her will.

27:16.533 --> 27:18.100
So, she had five children.

27:18.100 --> 27:19.733
She was super-religious.

27:19.733 --> 27:23.067
Their family had lived here
for 50 years.

27:23.067 --> 27:24.233
Wow.

27:24.233 --> 27:27.633
And so they would have
an attachment to this house.

27:27.633 --> 27:29.133
Mm-hmm.

27:29.133 --> 27:30.700
Now please think
about how they tried

27:30.700 --> 27:32.333
to talk to this woman. Right.

27:32.333 --> 27:34.567
If she were an 80-year-old
woman who passed away,

27:34.567 --> 27:36.233
who lived the majority
of her life here...

27:36.233 --> 27:37.400
Yeah. That's absurd.

27:37.400 --> 27:38.967
Yeah. Absurd.

27:38.967 --> 27:40.467
You know? So, let's see.

27:40.467 --> 27:42.500
Please.
I hope we get a response.

27:42.500 --> 27:44.867
Maybe if we use her name. Yeah.

27:44.867 --> 27:47.333
Maybe there's something here
of hers that we could use.

27:47.333 --> 27:51.067
Do we know if there's anything
here that belonged to her?

27:51.067 --> 27:52.300
I don't know.

27:52.300 --> 27:53.633
Should we ask him? Yeah.

27:53.633 --> 27:56.400
All right. I'm gonna text Jason.

27:56.400 --> 27:58.567
Okay, so, I just got
a text from Jason,

27:58.567 --> 28:01.167
and he says
that there are some belongings

28:01.167 --> 28:03.633
from that previous family
in the basement.

28:06.500 --> 28:09.233
We're looking
for a small ceramic rabbit.

28:09.233 --> 28:12.633
Supposedly, Marjorie's family
left it behind when they moved.

28:15.367 --> 28:17.767
I'm gonna check in the back.

28:17.767 --> 28:19.767
Yeah. It's probably back there.

28:28.633 --> 28:30.100
Oh, my gosh.

28:30.100 --> 28:33.267
Did you find it? Yeah.

28:33.267 --> 28:34.833
It's just so tiny. Wait.

28:34.833 --> 28:36.200
I can't... oh, I'm like...

28:36.200 --> 28:39.167
It's so tiny. Look.

28:39.167 --> 28:40.900
Oh, my god.

28:40.900 --> 28:42.067
That...

28:42.067 --> 28:43.200
It belongs to that woman.

28:43.200 --> 28:44.300
Here, let's go use it, then.

28:44.300 --> 28:45.300
Let's take it upstairs.

28:45.300 --> 28:46.667
Let's go this way.

28:46.667 --> 28:49.700
Since we heard the female
disembodied voice upstairs

28:49.700 --> 28:51.733
last night,
that's where we'll start.

28:51.733 --> 28:53.533
We'll use the bunny
as a trigger object

28:53.533 --> 28:56.333
and attach it
to our proximity sensor.

28:56.333 --> 28:59.067
The rabbit is very small,
so we'll use a paper plate

28:59.067 --> 29:01.067
to expand the center's reach.

29:03.067 --> 29:07.500
All right,
so, whoever is here with us,

29:07.500 --> 29:12.067
we're looking for someone
named Margie.

29:14.067 --> 29:15.567
Is that your bunny?

29:18.800 --> 29:20.500
Can you look at it
really closely

29:20.500 --> 29:22.667
or even try to touch it?

29:24.667 --> 29:27.767
Do you like Jason?

29:27.767 --> 29:30.133
He seems like a nice guy.

29:35.500 --> 29:37.800
I know his friend Chris
and his family came in,

29:37.800 --> 29:40.800
and they started talking to you.

29:40.800 --> 29:42.467
Did that surprise you?

29:45.733 --> 29:47.933
I apologize if anyone
in the past

29:47.933 --> 29:50.733
has spoken to you
in a negative way.

29:52.467 --> 29:54.533
All right. Let's listen to this.

29:57.100 --> 29:58.833
<i>Well, okay.</i>

29:58.833 --> 30:01.733
<i>All right, so...</i>

30:08.333 --> 30:10.567
<i>Do you...</i>

30:10.567 --> 30:11.767
<i>Do you like...</i>

30:42.200 --> 30:43.267
<i>He seems like a nice guy.</i>

30:43.267 --> 30:44.100
"Yes." yes.

30:44.100 --> 30:48.333
"Do you like Jason?" "Yes."

30:50.267 --> 30:51.233
"Yes."

30:51.233 --> 30:52.667
<i>He seems like a nice guy.</i>

30:52.667 --> 30:55.400
<i>I know his friend Chris
and his family came in.</i>

30:55.400 --> 30:57.667
Hmm.

30:57.667 --> 31:02.067
I think whoever this is
is definitely not demonic.

31:02.067 --> 31:04.600
It's actually the opposite.
Okay.

31:04.600 --> 31:06.833
So, you know what? Why don't...

31:06.833 --> 31:08.800
We had the voice in there
last night,

31:08.800 --> 31:10.167
so why don't
I put it in the hallway,

31:10.167 --> 31:11.800
and we'll ask questions?
Mm-hmm. Yeah.

31:18.967 --> 31:21.567
So, just to make sure

31:21.567 --> 31:23.067
we're talking
to the right person,

31:23.067 --> 31:25.967
can you say your name
as loud as you can?

31:27.933 --> 31:30.967
Did you leave this house
to your children?

31:30.967 --> 31:33.267
I think your daughter.
Was it Michelle?

31:33.267 --> 31:36.733
Was she the executor

31:36.733 --> 31:38.833
of your estate?

31:43.900 --> 31:45.100
Were you happy with the way

31:45.100 --> 31:48.767
that your estate was handled
after you passed?

31:51.533 --> 31:53.067
What was her husband's name?

31:53.067 --> 31:54.067
Edward.

31:54.067 --> 31:56.067
Do you remember Edward?

31:59.400 --> 32:01.067
Did that sound
like Edwin to you?

32:01.067 --> 32:02.367
No, I don't know. I mean...

32:02.367 --> 32:04.367
Something's responding,
but I don't know what it says.

32:08.967 --> 32:11.967
I bet that's why
she's so confused.

32:11.967 --> 32:13.800
Edwin. And his name is Edward.

32:13.800 --> 32:15.233
Yeah.

32:17.467 --> 32:20.500
Let's go back downstairs
where we got the EVP.

32:24.167 --> 32:27.067
Marjorie...

32:27.067 --> 32:30.567
Do you know...

32:30.567 --> 32:33.167
Edward?

32:33.167 --> 32:35.167
Are you looking for Edward?

32:38.467 --> 32:41.367
Do you have a reason to be here?

32:44.367 --> 32:46.367
How many children do you have?

32:49.800 --> 32:51.367
Would you like to leave?

32:53.567 --> 32:55.200
Were you frightened

32:55.200 --> 32:59.233
by some of the things
that Jason's friends said?

32:59.233 --> 33:01.900
Did they upset you?

33:05.400 --> 33:07.067
Listen.

33:07.067 --> 33:08.767
<i>Okay, um...</i>

33:15.333 --> 33:16.700
<i>Are you looking for Edward?</i>
"Edward."

33:16.700 --> 33:18.233
Yeah, I think
she said, "Edward."

33:18.233 --> 33:19.733
"Edward." Right.

33:23.200 --> 33:25.333
"Edward."

33:25.333 --> 33:28.467
"No."

33:29.767 --> 33:31.100
"I don't know."

33:31.100 --> 33:32.500
Did you hear that?

33:36.400 --> 33:38.767
Yes! Oh, my god! "I don't know."

33:38.767 --> 33:39.833
"I don't know."

33:39.833 --> 33:41.900
Oh, my god.

33:41.900 --> 33:44.333
That is clear as day.

33:50.900 --> 33:52.367
Does that say,
"I have five children"?

33:52.367 --> 33:54.433
I think it says,
"I have five children."

33:59.633 --> 34:00.867
<i>Do you know your children</i>

34:00.867 --> 34:02.067
<i>are no longer living
in this house?</i>

34:07.267 --> 34:09.933
I feel so bad for her right now.

34:16.632 --> 34:17.967
Cut. Oh!

34:17.967 --> 34:20.067
I feel
so bad for her right now.

34:36.266 --> 34:39.266
I feel so bad for her right now.

34:45.867 --> 34:47.199
Cut. Oh!

34:47.199 --> 34:49.433
I feel
so bad for her right now.

34:57.967 --> 35:01.067
<i>...the things
that Jason's friends said?</i>

35:07.333 --> 35:10.933
God.

35:10.933 --> 35:13.233
Well, I think we know
who's here.

35:15.800 --> 35:18.300
I just feel so bad for her.

35:24.267 --> 35:26.567
I'm, like, so mad.

35:26.567 --> 35:27.900
You're mad at those people.
I'm so mad.

35:27.900 --> 35:29.567
I know. Yeah, I'm so mad.

35:29.567 --> 35:34.933
And that is why you don't
just run into houses

35:34.933 --> 35:36.700
and start yelling at ghosts.

35:36.700 --> 35:38.267
Oh, god.

35:38.267 --> 35:40.067
You affect so many people.

35:40.067 --> 35:41.633
It's not just the living.

35:41.633 --> 35:43.333
It's... it's...

35:47.067 --> 35:48.633
You know what?

35:48.633 --> 35:50.500
She was super-religious.

35:50.500 --> 35:53.167
Why don't you lead us in
a little prayer, just for her?

35:53.167 --> 35:54.400
Okay. Just a little something.

35:54.400 --> 35:56.700
Maybe it would help her
be at peace.

35:56.700 --> 36:01.533
Margie, we're gonna pray
if you want to join us.

36:01.533 --> 36:07.067
Dear lord, we are here
having a moment for Margie.

36:07.067 --> 36:12.067
She lived in this house
many, many, many years.

36:12.067 --> 36:15.400
So, at this time,
we ask that you give her

36:15.400 --> 36:18.367
all the love and strength
that you can.

36:18.367 --> 36:20.133
In your name, we do pray. Amen.

36:20.133 --> 36:21.700
Amen.

36:21.700 --> 36:25.600
This is an intense case.

36:25.600 --> 36:27.533
What was that?

36:27.533 --> 36:29.167
I thought it said, "Help me."

36:29.167 --> 36:30.200
Well, yeah.

36:30.200 --> 36:32.167
It waits till the last minute
to come out.

36:39.300 --> 36:41.367
I'm ready.
We can talk to Jason tomorrow.

36:41.367 --> 36:45.133
I think we know what
to tell him, and, you know,

36:45.133 --> 36:47.200
it's just gonna be a matter
of, how is he gonna take it?

36:47.200 --> 36:48.533
Is he gonna believe us? Yeah.

36:48.533 --> 36:49.600
I don't know.

36:58.567 --> 37:01.767
This was an interesting case
for us.

37:01.767 --> 37:03.367
It was.

37:03.367 --> 37:05.833
We researched Edwin Davis to...

37:05.833 --> 37:07.200
A "T." To a "T."

37:07.200 --> 37:10.300
I spoke with an author
in London.

37:10.300 --> 37:13.167
I met with Larry
down at the bar.

37:13.167 --> 37:15.767
We used all this information
in our investigation.

37:15.767 --> 37:18.067
But it was just quiet for us.

37:18.067 --> 37:19.100
Really silent.

37:19.100 --> 37:20.533
Nothing happened.

37:20.533 --> 37:22.867
But that doesn't mean
that something's not here.

37:22.867 --> 37:25.767
We have some evidence to show
you from our security cameras.

37:25.767 --> 37:28.200
So I'm gonna play it for you.

37:28.200 --> 37:29.533
Here we go.

37:32.067 --> 37:33.600
What the hell was that?

37:33.600 --> 37:34.967
You see that?

37:34.967 --> 37:37.800
You see that?
Here, it's gonna repeat.

37:45.500 --> 37:47.067
That's not right. I'm sorry.

37:47.067 --> 37:48.967
So, you kind of see
a little movement,

37:48.967 --> 37:51.633
and then you see
what appears to be, like,

37:51.633 --> 37:53.867
an anomaly on the screen,
and then it goes away.

37:53.867 --> 37:55.733
That looks like somebody
walking down the stairs.

37:55.733 --> 37:58.500
Right. And it follows
the trajectory of the stairs.

37:58.500 --> 38:00.133
We don't think
it's anything negative.

38:00.133 --> 38:02.133
We don't think
it's anything to be afraid of.

38:02.133 --> 38:05.067
And we don't think that
it pushed you down the stairs.

38:05.067 --> 38:07.767
The EVP's gonna explain why.

38:07.767 --> 38:10.433
This is one where we ask,
you know, "Do you like Jason?"

38:10.433 --> 38:12.200
Mm-hmm. So, go ahead and listen.

38:16.467 --> 38:18.733
Yeah. Yes.

38:18.733 --> 38:21.533
Whoever this is likes you,
and that's a good thing,

38:21.533 --> 38:23.200
because I know that you felt

38:23.200 --> 38:24.900
maybe like it
could be a bad thing,

38:24.900 --> 38:27.700
and I think, at this point,
we've ruled that out.

38:27.700 --> 38:29.933
Yeah. It's not a negative thing.

38:29.933 --> 38:31.767
But then there's this female.

38:31.767 --> 38:34.867
We heard the voice with you,
the disembodied voice.

38:34.867 --> 38:36.867
So we start thinking,
"Who could it be?"

38:36.867 --> 38:39.233
And that's kind of
when we had this epiphany,

38:39.233 --> 38:43.067
because the activity didn't
start until you moved in here.

38:43.067 --> 38:44.200
Right.

38:44.200 --> 38:46.433
And it dawned on me
that the previous owner,

38:46.433 --> 38:48.633
the wife...
Her name was Marjorie.

38:48.633 --> 38:51.700
She passed away before
you bought the house.

38:51.700 --> 38:55.833
So, we started thinking,
"Could it be this woman?"

38:55.833 --> 38:57.700
And she was very religious.

38:57.700 --> 39:00.400
She lived to be 80 years old.

39:00.400 --> 39:03.400
And got this EVP.

39:07.233 --> 39:09.467
I hear something children,
but I can't make out the number.

39:09.467 --> 39:11.767
It says, "I have five children."

39:11.767 --> 39:13.700
Marjorie did have five children,

39:13.700 --> 39:15.867
and she also had
a husband named Edward,

39:15.867 --> 39:17.600
and we think he's here with her.

39:17.600 --> 39:19.333
Check out this EVP.

39:21.667 --> 39:23.967
It's "Edward."

39:23.967 --> 39:25.433
It's clearly "Edward." Yeah.

39:25.433 --> 39:26.567
It makes more sense.

39:26.567 --> 39:28.100
Once I heard that, I thought,

39:28.100 --> 39:32.567
"She and her husband, Edward,
are just still here with you."

39:32.567 --> 39:34.733
And, honestly, we talked
to her a lot last night.

39:34.733 --> 39:36.467
We told her
exactly what was going on,

39:36.467 --> 39:39.367
and once we said
that nice prayer for her,

39:39.367 --> 39:40.900
it was, you know...

39:40.900 --> 39:44.167
It might even already
be scaled way back for you.

39:44.167 --> 39:46.067
Yeah. I'm... I'm...

39:46.067 --> 39:48.067
Thank you.

39:48.067 --> 39:51.300
It's good to know
you don't have to worry.

39:51.300 --> 39:54.067
Well, we just have
one more thing to talk about.

39:54.067 --> 39:57.267
I spent a lot of time
talking to your friend Chris,

39:57.267 --> 40:00.867
and my advice to Chris
would be, you know,

40:00.867 --> 40:02.633
learn a little bit more...
Mm-hmm.

40:02.633 --> 40:05.833
...and, you know,

40:05.833 --> 40:08.067
stop investigating this house.

40:08.067 --> 40:09.867
Yeah. I can go with that.

40:09.867 --> 40:11.267
We'll tell them for you
if you want.

40:11.267 --> 40:12.633
I told them that multiple times.

40:12.633 --> 40:16.200
I think that the way
they approached it

40:16.200 --> 40:19.067
kind of riled them up
and confused them.

40:19.067 --> 40:21.567
And so, I think when you
were here by yourself,

40:21.567 --> 40:24.067
they were trying to get
your attention, to say,

40:24.067 --> 40:26.233
"You know, why are you guys
treating us like this?

40:26.233 --> 40:27.633
Why are you talking
to us like this?"

40:27.633 --> 40:30.267
You know, they're just trying
to maybe right things,

40:30.267 --> 40:33.667
and it kind of instigated
more activity for you.

40:33.667 --> 40:37.400
And so, now I think
you know who's here,

40:37.400 --> 40:39.467
and that's gonna make
a huge difference.

40:39.467 --> 40:42.633
I think your activity level's
gonna go way back.

40:42.633 --> 40:47.267
We would suggest, you know,
moving back upstairs.

40:47.267 --> 40:49.633
I think it will make all the
difference in the world for you.

40:49.633 --> 40:52.033
Mm-hmm.
I'm still in shock, actually.

40:52.033 --> 40:53.967
So, but...
It's a good shock, though?

40:53.967 --> 40:55.067
You feel good? Yeah.

40:55.067 --> 40:56.233
I'm like...

40:56.233 --> 40:58.900
It was not what I expected,
I guess, so...

40:58.900 --> 41:00.300
It never is.

41:00.300 --> 41:02.200
No, it's never what we expect
either, to be honest.

41:02.200 --> 41:05.167
I mean, we're looking for
the first executioner

41:05.167 --> 41:06.467
of New York possibly,

41:06.467 --> 41:08.967
and we got a sweet old lady.

41:08.967 --> 41:10.933
- The opposite.
- Mm-hmm. Yeah, yeah.

41:10.933 --> 41:12.233
So...
but, no. Thanks a lot, though.

41:12.233 --> 41:13.767
This is... it helped.

41:13.767 --> 41:16.400
I think it's on the road
to improvement.

41:16.400 --> 41:17.500
That's for sure.

41:17.500 --> 41:18.967
Well, thank you.
Thanks for having us.

41:18.967 --> 41:23.067
If you need anything, you know,
we're just a phone call away.

41:23.067 --> 41:27.133
This case above any other
has been a valuable lesson

41:27.133 --> 41:30.367
for investigations
and investigators

41:30.367 --> 41:35.300
and what can happen when
you think you are doing good

41:35.300 --> 41:37.167
when, in fact,
you're doing more harm.

41:37.167 --> 41:38.533
Thank you. Thanks a lot.

41:38.533 --> 41:39.600
Of course.

41:39.600 --> 41:41.567
We came in here
thinking that this house

41:41.567 --> 41:44.067
had some crazy things going on.

41:44.067 --> 41:47.867
And we were very surprised
by the outcome, as usual.

41:47.867 --> 41:52.300
And I think that Jason is going
to be able to move on from this,

41:52.300 --> 41:55.200
and there will be no more
investigations in this house.
