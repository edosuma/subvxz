34:53.091 --> 34:54.396
[panting]

34:54.440 --> 34:56.529
...that they could be better.

34:56.572 --> 34:59.227
I know that Angus
showed you a better way.

34:59.271 --> 35:00.141
He showed me, too.

35:00.185 --> 35:02.839
He's my family.

35:02.883 --> 35:05.190
I want to help him.

35:06.234 --> 35:08.410
Killing me
doesn't stop this.

35:08.454 --> 35:10.369
The only thingthat does that is helping Angus,

35:10.412 --> 35:12.240
and you're not gonna
get to him in time.

35:14.329 --> 35:17.245
[grunting]

35:18.333 --> 35:20.205
[yelling]

35:20.248 --> 35:22.250
[grunts]

35:34.175 --> 35:36.395
[gunshot, thud]

35:41.530 --> 35:42.966
[panting]

35:43.010 --> 35:45.186
You all right?Yeah.

35:45.230 --> 35:46.840
[grunts]

35:48.407 --> 35:50.409
We have less than six minutes,
and it can't be disarmed.

35:50.452 --> 35:52.324
I know.
That's not the plan.

35:55.022 --> 35:56.893
Interrupt the
chain reaction.

35:56.937 --> 35:58.286
Smart kid.

35:59.331 --> 36:02.247
The time-delay fuse.

36:02.290 --> 36:03.552
It must have brokenwhen he attacked me.

36:03.596 --> 36:05.206
[sighs]

36:05.250 --> 36:08.992
I'm gonna haveto set it off manually.

36:09.036 --> 36:10.124
[panting]

36:10.168 --> 36:12.692
This is a one-way trip.

36:25.574 --> 36:27.010
MacGYVER:
I need you guys to get

36:27.054 --> 36:28.534
as far away from here as
possible, as fast as you can.

36:28.577 --> 36:30.188
The time delay won't work.
I'm gonna set it off myself.

36:30.231 --> 36:31.667
Mac!MacGYVER:
Don't think!

36:31.711 --> 36:33.234
Just run.

36:33.278 --> 36:35.193
Angus. Go.

36:37.107 --> 36:38.631
I can do this.

36:39.675 --> 36:41.286
What? No, I...

36:41.329 --> 36:43.331
[voice breaking]:
There's no time.
Let me do this.

36:43.375 --> 36:44.854
Please.

36:44.898 --> 36:46.552
For Ellen.

36:50.991 --> 36:53.298
[sighs]

36:58.912 --> 37:01.001
[sighs]

37:04.134 --> 37:05.962
You connect this to, uh...

37:06.006 --> 37:08.008
I know. I got it.

37:17.191 --> 37:20.107
"You deserve the world.

37:20.150 --> 37:22.152
And the world deserves you."

37:27.027 --> 37:28.246
Go.

37:28.289 --> 37:30.248
Run. Now!

37:36.950 --> 37:39.300
[groaning]

37:55.229 --> 37:57.623
[grunting]

38:11.332 --> 38:13.378
[laughing]

38:18.383 --> 38:19.427
[coughing]

38:30.264 --> 38:32.614
Well done.

38:32.658 --> 38:34.442
[gasps]

38:42.407 --> 38:45.410
MATTY:
We have a Nuclear Emergency
Support Team excavating

38:45.453 --> 38:47.063
the Dixon Dam site.

38:47.107 --> 38:49.936
Although Gwen managed to stopa full-scale nuclear explosion,

38:49.979 --> 38:52.242
we still need to sweep the area
for radiation.

38:52.286 --> 38:54.332
BOZER:Mac?

38:54.375 --> 38:57.030
We're, uh...

38:57.073 --> 38:59.293
We're sorry about your aunt.

38:59.337 --> 39:00.425
Thanks.

39:02.644 --> 39:04.516
DESI:
So, what about

39:04.559 --> 39:05.647
Codex?

39:05.691 --> 39:07.780
The bunker's empty.
Cleared out.

39:07.823 --> 39:10.304
Looks like Leland took the restof Codex into hiding.

39:10.348 --> 39:11.914
MATTY:
We destroyed their
infrastructure

39:11.958 --> 39:12.959
and their plan.

39:14.482 --> 39:15.527
Oh.

39:15.570 --> 39:17.398
Uh, one more thing.[grunts]

39:17.442 --> 39:19.052
[crashing]Oh, bloody...

39:19.095 --> 39:20.358
RILEY:
Ow!
Oh, bloody,

39:20.401 --> 39:22.447
wanking...Is that supposed to be swearing?

39:22.490 --> 39:24.318
No, no, it's all right. No, no.

39:24.362 --> 39:25.667
Thank you.

39:26.407 --> 39:28.322
Your badges.

39:33.153 --> 39:35.373
Welcome back to the Phoenix.

39:40.116 --> 39:42.118
Hilarious.

39:42.162 --> 39:44.730
I'll get you new ones as soon
as possible. In the meantime,

39:44.773 --> 39:49.430
I'm gonna be, uh, out of
action for a while, so, Mac,

39:49.474 --> 39:51.954
you're going to have to
take over my duties, too.

39:53.391 --> 39:55.131
There's a lot of work
to be done out there.

39:56.176 --> 39:58.396
About that.

40:02.182 --> 40:04.924
I think I knowjust where to begin.

40:18.677 --> 40:20.679
[indistinct chatter]

40:31.777 --> 40:33.343
[sighs]

40:33.387 --> 40:34.388
You ready for this?

40:34.432 --> 40:36.259
Of course, yeah.It'll be fine.

40:36.303 --> 40:37.435
[chuckles softly]

40:37.478 --> 40:39.437
You're nervous.

40:39.480 --> 40:41.395
I know you better
than you think.

40:41.439 --> 40:43.789
Oh, yeah?What am I thinking right now?

40:43.832 --> 40:46.052
Third season of Rick
and Mortyis the best,

40:46.095 --> 40:48.010
you shouldn't have
had an espresso, and

40:48.054 --> 40:50.448
you really want to fix thatbroken light fixture over there.

40:53.625 --> 40:54.713
It was Americano.

40:54.756 --> 40:56.758
Ah.

40:58.847 --> 41:00.849
Desi... [clears throat]

41:00.893 --> 41:04.549
I... am...

41:04.592 --> 41:06.464
Hey, let's not talk
about it, okay?

41:06.507 --> 41:08.553
Yeah, right. Understood.

41:08.596 --> 41:10.642
What I mean, egghead, is,

41:10.685 --> 41:13.035
I don't want to talk
about it right now.

41:14.559 --> 41:16.082
You can buy me a drink,
and we'll talk later.

41:16.125 --> 41:18.519
You got it.

41:18.563 --> 41:20.347
As long as I do
the drink ordering,

41:20.390 --> 41:21.827
because your taste in
drinks is embarrassing.

41:21.870 --> 41:23.481
It was one time.I'd never seen a Bubblegum

41:23.524 --> 41:24.612
Cosmotini Spritzer before.

41:24.656 --> 41:26.266
I just wanted to try it out.You had two.

41:26.309 --> 41:27.267
Hey, we're ready for you.

41:27.310 --> 41:28.529
Yeah, of course.

41:28.573 --> 41:29.443
Uh...Yes.

41:34.448 --> 41:37.320
Thank you for joining us,Mr. MacGyver.

41:37.364 --> 41:39.322
We value your opinion.

41:39.366 --> 41:40.933
Thank you very much.

41:42.978 --> 41:46.591
But this is not about opinions.

41:46.634 --> 41:48.680
It's about science.

41:48.723 --> 41:51.857
Our planet is in trouble.

41:51.900 --> 41:55.643
"Knowing isn't enough.

41:55.687 --> 41:57.602
"We must apply.

41:57.645 --> 41:58.907
"Being willing isn't enough.

41:58.951 --> 42:00.561
We must do."

42:00.605 --> 42:02.650
Da Vinci said that.

42:04.565 --> 42:06.524
And my mother.

42:11.485 --> 42:14.488
Let's start with carbon
pollution due to fossil fuels.
