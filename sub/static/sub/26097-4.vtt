00:07.424 --> 00:09.968
[Ms. Whitaker] "And even though
it was way, way too short,

00:10.052 --> 00:12.971
it's an accomplishment
that will stay with me forever."

00:15.599 --> 00:16.517
No.

00:16.975 --> 00:18.185
-What?
-Sam,

00:18.268 --> 00:21.980
you can't write your college essay
about seeing an exotic dancer's boobies.

00:22.064 --> 00:25.150
Why not? They asked
about my greatest accomplishments.

00:25.234 --> 00:27.611
That's one of my greatest accomplishments.

00:27.694 --> 00:31.240
You say you don't do any extracurriculars
because they're too crowded,

00:31.323 --> 00:33.033
and you opted out of PE

00:33.116 --> 00:35.410
because the mesh shorts ride
up your butt.

00:35.911 --> 00:36.995
Why?

00:37.579 --> 00:38.789
Because it's true.

00:39.206 --> 00:43.043
Okay, well, in this case,
true is less important than appropriate.

00:43.126 --> 00:45.254
Okay? They just wanna hear about you, Sam.

00:45.337 --> 00:47.214
Who you are, what makes you tick.

00:47.798 --> 00:49.049
What about your autism?

00:49.132 --> 00:50.217
What about it?

00:50.300 --> 00:53.679
Well, why don't you write about that?
I mean, you get good grades,

00:53.762 --> 00:55.847
you've had the same job for over a year.

00:55.931 --> 00:58.850
Those are major accomplishments
for anyone with ASD.

00:58.934 --> 01:02.312
I mean, half the neurotypicals
I know can't even do that.

01:02.729 --> 01:04.731
You're a real success story, Sam.

01:05.107 --> 01:07.109
[birds tweeting]

01:07.359 --> 01:08.193
No.

01:08.610 --> 01:12.072
-No?
-Autism isn't an accomplishment.

01:12.155 --> 01:13.865
It's something I was born with.

01:14.241 --> 01:15.701
You wouldn't write an essay

01:15.784 --> 01:18.203
about having ten fingers
and ten toes, would you?

01:18.287 --> 01:21.415
No, because that would be really,
really, really, really dumb.

01:21.498 --> 01:23.250
So I'll stick with the boobs.

01:24.751 --> 01:26.503
Take another crack at it, buddy.

01:29.756 --> 01:32.259
Take another crack at it?
What does that even mean?

01:32.342 --> 01:34.219
This is crazy.
I don't know how to do this.

01:34.303 --> 01:37.389
So now I have to redo my entire essay
even though all I ever did...

01:42.352 --> 01:45.397
-So how am I supposed to change that?
-Let me see.

01:47.232 --> 01:50.736
Mm-hmm.<i></i>Mm-hmm.

01:50.819 --> 01:53.864
[clicks tongue] Yeah, this is garbage.
It's fun, but it's garbage.

01:53.947 --> 01:55.032
What? Why?

01:55.115 --> 01:56.742
You're being too honest.

01:56.825 --> 01:59.411
You gotta... tell 'em
what they want to hear.

01:59.494 --> 02:00.996
You gotta lie, dude.

02:01.079 --> 02:04.541
I can't lie. I'm bad at it
and I don't like it. What's the point?

02:04.625 --> 02:08.170
Well, Imagine if you didn't like your boss
at work.

02:08.253 --> 02:09.588
I do. I like Bob.

02:09.671 --> 02:11.673
I know, that's why I said "imagine."

02:12.549 --> 02:15.510
If you lie and pretend
that you like them, you're fine.

02:16.053 --> 02:17.679
But if you tell them the truth,

02:17.763 --> 02:20.349
you get fired, you can't afford food,

02:20.432 --> 02:23.226
and you get shanked for cutting in line
at the soup kitchen.

02:23.477 --> 02:24.936
And then you die.

02:25.020 --> 02:29.232
-Huh! That does make sense.
-Sometimes you have to lie to get by.

02:29.816 --> 02:33.487
Oh, like how a polar bear cub will cover
its black nose

02:33.570 --> 02:35.947
to blend in with the snow
when it's trying to hunt a seal.

02:36.573 --> 02:38.283
Yeah, sure.

02:38.617 --> 02:42.079
What I'm saying is
that lying is an important survival skill,

02:42.162 --> 02:44.164
like using a flint to light a fire.

02:44.247 --> 02:46.958
-I can't do that either.
-Oh, dude, it's not that hard.

02:47.042 --> 02:49.628
-Really?
-I don't know. It was a lie.

02:50.170 --> 02:52.464
-Do you see how easy that was?
-Yes.

02:52.881 --> 02:54.257
You're really good at lying.

02:54.341 --> 02:57.052
I learned everything I know
from the Dark Lord herself.

02:57.719 --> 02:58.720
Mom.

03:03.517 --> 03:05.977
-Sam. Are you okay?
-Yep.

03:06.061 --> 03:09.231
I need to learn how to lie,
and you're the biggest liar I know.

03:20.117 --> 03:22.369
[motor hums]

03:24.996 --> 03:30.252
I just can't believe Ms. Whitaker would
tell you to lie on your college essay.

03:30.711 --> 03:33.839
She didn't. It was actually Casey
who had the excellent idea.

03:33.922 --> 03:35.424
Oh, of course it was.

03:35.674 --> 03:39.678
Um, look, sweetie, regardless
of your sister's terrible advice,

03:39.928 --> 03:42.597
it is never okay to lie.

03:42.681 --> 03:44.850
Lies tend to snowball and...

03:45.350 --> 03:47.102
one leads to another...

03:47.185 --> 03:51.440
and before you know it,
you are so deep in a hole,

03:51.523 --> 03:54.568
it's almost impossible
to dig yourself back out.

03:54.985 --> 03:55.819
Okay.

03:56.236 --> 04:00.115
Number one: the idea of digging yourself
out of a hole is ridiculous.

04:00.198 --> 04:02.242
The more you dig, the deeper you get.

04:02.325 --> 04:05.954
Yeah. You're right.
How did that ever become an expression?

04:06.037 --> 04:09.249
And number two: you're a good liar.
I mean, you lie all the time.

04:09.332 --> 04:11.835
Your whole life was a lie
when you were cheating on Dad.

04:13.712 --> 04:15.714
Sweetie, I... [whimpering softly]

04:15.839 --> 04:17.841
I'm not proud of my behavior.

04:19.551 --> 04:24.055
And I just hope that you'll learn
from my mistakes, and that...

04:24.222 --> 04:26.141
you'll be a better person than I've been.

04:26.224 --> 04:30.228
Yes, of course, that's obvious.
But that's unhelpful to me now. Okay. Bye.

04:36.985 --> 04:38.278
[phone buzzes]

04:44.075 --> 04:45.744
-Hey.
-[Evan] <i>Casey!</i>

04:45.869 --> 04:48.830
What's up? Are you okay?

04:49.289 --> 04:52.793
Yeah. I've just been doing precalc
for the last 75 hours.

04:52.876 --> 04:54.795
But other than that, I'm good. Why?

04:55.754 --> 04:57.255
I mean, you were really drunk.

04:57.839 --> 05:00.133
You're not mad at me
for telling your mom, are you?

05:00.217 --> 05:02.552
<i>-I didn't know what to do.</i>
-No, I get it.

05:02.844 --> 05:05.806
If you call my mom, I'll kill you.
If you call my dad, he'll kill you.

05:05.889 --> 05:07.933
Yeah. Your dad is in the medical field,

05:08.016 --> 05:10.727
so it'd be very easy
for him to dispose of a body.

05:10.852 --> 05:12.479
[Casey chuckles]

05:12.562 --> 05:15.232
-You didn't get in trouble, did you?
-Technically, I'm grounded.

05:15.315 --> 05:18.860
But my mom doesn't live here anymore
and my dad doesn't know about it, so...

05:19.152 --> 05:22.906
I think I'm just gonna fly under the radar
until the next family crisis,

05:23.114 --> 05:25.075
-which shouldn't be too long.
-[Evan laughs]

05:26.201 --> 05:28.119
So I was looking at my phone,

05:28.203 --> 05:31.414
and it looks like
you took a few selfies the other night.

05:31.498 --> 05:32.332
<i>I did?</i>

05:33.458 --> 05:36.753
-Oh, I did! You have to delete those.
-I already did.

05:36.837 --> 05:38.880
<i>But they will always be in my brain.</i>

05:40.423 --> 05:41.466
Oh, my God.

05:41.925 --> 05:43.927
It's all coming back to me now.

05:44.052 --> 05:45.512
[Evan laughs]

05:46.054 --> 05:49.307
I'm sorry, but I will never be able
to look you in the eyes again. [chuckles]

05:49.391 --> 05:52.435
-[Evan laughs]
-I love you, but this is goodbye forever.

05:52.519 --> 05:53.478
Such a bummer.

05:53.562 --> 05:56.481
I was hoping you'd sing those camp songs
to me again really loud.

05:56.565 --> 05:57.440
<i>Oh, my God, stop.</i>

05:57.524 --> 05:58.859
<i>♪ Camp Three Pines ♪</i>

05:58.942 --> 06:00.360
<i>♪ You'll always be mine ♪</i>

06:00.443 --> 06:01.278
No!

06:05.907 --> 06:09.411
[sighs] I folded your shirts,
but I'm not touching the under stuff.

06:09.494 --> 06:12.205
Okay? If it's lacy, it's Casey.

06:12.330 --> 06:14.416
-I just made that up.
-Thanks.

06:14.666 --> 06:15.625
[pants] Okay.

06:16.042 --> 06:16.960
Hey, Dad.

06:17.961 --> 06:20.088
You okay? You seem tired.

06:20.171 --> 06:22.716
Yeah, I'm good. I'm fine. [pants]

06:23.091 --> 06:23.925
Okay.

06:28.138 --> 06:30.390
So, Sam called me a liar.

06:31.141 --> 06:33.018
And the thing is, he's not wrong.

06:33.101 --> 06:34.853
I do tell some whoppers.

06:35.312 --> 06:38.940
In fact, I'm pretty sure growing up
I was encouraged to lie.

06:39.024 --> 06:43.445
You know, to be...
polite when I was actually uncomfortable.

06:44.070 --> 06:47.949
To not say what I was actually thinking.

06:52.120 --> 06:54.164
So it's ironic, then, that I...

06:54.456 --> 06:57.334
have a son who says what he's thinking.

06:57.417 --> 07:03.006
And who has practically
no ability to... be fake.

07:03.673 --> 07:06.384
Um... And it's inspiring.

07:07.510 --> 07:09.930
I don't know if I could go a day
without lying

07:10.013 --> 07:11.932
and that's really sad because...

07:13.099 --> 07:15.810
um... lying ruined my life.

07:16.770 --> 07:17.646
[clicks tongue]

07:18.355 --> 07:21.149
So I guess what I'm saying is I'm...

07:22.150 --> 07:25.070
going to try and be more like Sam.

07:25.654 --> 07:26.780
[woman] Nice.

07:27.280 --> 07:28.281
Um...

07:29.866 --> 07:30.951
[breathes deeply]

07:32.786 --> 07:33.745
Marguerite,

07:34.788 --> 07:36.122
you burnt the brownies.

07:41.461 --> 07:43.463
[heart beating]

07:44.464 --> 07:46.466
[woman speaking indistinctly over PA]

07:46.758 --> 07:49.302
And there's your baby.

07:50.178 --> 07:52.055
-See that little flicker there?
-Yeah.

07:52.305 --> 07:53.223
That's the heartbeat.

07:54.015 --> 07:55.392
Nice and strong.

07:55.475 --> 07:57.477
Great. Really great.

07:57.560 --> 07:59.813
-Would you like to know the gender?
-[shouts] Hell no!

08:01.815 --> 08:02.816
I'm so sorry.

08:03.692 --> 08:06.903
-There's no need to apologize.
-I'm usually not a yeller.

08:07.362 --> 08:08.363
It's okay.

08:08.863 --> 08:12.242
I'm just having a hard time
getting my head around this.

08:12.534 --> 08:14.577
My friend and my ex think
that I'm in denial

08:14.661 --> 08:18.039
because I won't buy maternity clothes,
and I haven't told my parents yet.

08:18.123 --> 08:21.584
But, really, I think I just can't focus
because my life is blowing up,

08:21.668 --> 08:24.754
and I was mean to a patient,
which means I suck at my job,

08:24.838 --> 08:27.048
which is really my whole identity. So...

08:27.173 --> 08:29.175
[laughs and exhales]

08:31.177 --> 08:32.762
[breathes in]

08:32.846 --> 08:34.556
I'm just feeling a little lost.

08:34.639 --> 08:37.934
In general, would you say
you've been more emotional lately?

08:39.394 --> 08:40.437
[whimpers] No.

08:42.022 --> 08:43.857
[sniffs] I'm sorry.

08:44.524 --> 08:46.234
[breathes in] Maybe a little.

08:48.361 --> 08:50.113
-Is that bad?
-No.

08:50.530 --> 08:54.159
No, it's completely normal.
The hormones make you crazy.

08:56.327 --> 08:58.455
Oh, my God. You're right.

08:58.538 --> 09:00.957
I mean, that could explain
why I yelled at my patient.

09:01.124 --> 09:02.792
That thought never occurred to me.

09:04.127 --> 09:05.003
Tell you what.

09:05.086 --> 09:08.798
I'm going to put the ultrasound photo
and gender info in an envelope for you.

09:08.882 --> 09:12.552
That way if you get home
and decide you want to meet your kid,

09:12.635 --> 09:14.846
you have everything you need.
Sound good?

09:17.724 --> 09:20.685
You're gonna love these headphones.
No need to thank me for the discount.

09:20.769 --> 09:23.188
-I need to talk.
-Totally on me. Any questions at all,

09:23.271 --> 09:24.981
come please find me. I am your guy.

09:25.065 --> 09:28.777
Name's Zahid. Starts with a Z,
ends with a beautiful friendship?

09:29.360 --> 09:31.196
I wrote my Insta handle on that receipt.

09:31.279 --> 09:34.199
It's brownsugar_doingit.
Hit me up.

09:34.282 --> 09:36.284
[customers chattering]

09:37.368 --> 09:39.704
-Yes, Samuel?
-I don't know how to lie.

09:39.788 --> 09:42.040
You've come to the right place.
How can I be of service?

09:42.207 --> 09:43.958
Lying is a crucial life skill,

09:44.042 --> 09:46.336
but the biggest liar I know
won't teach me.

09:46.419 --> 09:48.379
Wrong. Yes, he will.

09:48.755 --> 09:50.090
Lying takes practice, homie.

09:50.173 --> 09:53.051
That's why I try to tell one doozy
in every room I walk into.

09:53.468 --> 09:55.178
Did you tell one in this room?

09:55.553 --> 09:57.722
I called that short guy
over there Stretch.

09:59.015 --> 10:01.893
Lucky for you, I have developed
a foolproof lying strategy.

10:01.976 --> 10:05.647
I call it the Pants on Fire technique,
or POF for short.

10:06.231 --> 10:07.065
Ready?

10:09.526 --> 10:10.944
-Yes.
-"P," praise.

10:11.027 --> 10:13.905
Start every lie with a compliment.
Something about their personality,

10:13.988 --> 10:16.491
or their appearance,
or their sharp new suspenders.

10:17.033 --> 10:19.994
-What if they're not wearing suspenders?
-Any accessory will do.

10:20.078 --> 10:23.665
People are desperate for validation.
Next, "O," as in "obviously."

10:23.748 --> 10:27.043
If they're skeptical of your lie,
simply repeat the word "obviously."

10:28.169 --> 10:30.171
-How many times?
-I play it by ear.

10:30.255 --> 10:32.048
But, I like to vary my tones.

10:32.132 --> 10:34.676
Finally, "F," for "flee the scene."

10:34.884 --> 10:38.429
Lying invites follow-up questions,
and follow-up questions kill lies,

10:38.513 --> 10:41.641
but you can't follow up
with a man who isn't there. Observe.

10:42.225 --> 10:44.936
Hey, Bob. I need tomorrow off.
I have a dentist appointment.

10:45.019 --> 10:48.314
-Again? I don't know, Zahid.
-If you don't want me to go, I won't.

10:48.398 --> 10:51.484
What you think of me really matters.
You're kind of like my role model.

10:51.568 --> 10:52.944
Also, sweet giraffe tie.

10:55.446 --> 10:57.407
Thanks. It's my spirit animal.

10:59.325 --> 11:03.705
Okay. Well...
if I let you go you understand,

11:03.788 --> 11:07.625
it's just this once
because it's an emergency, right?

11:07.709 --> 11:09.043
Obviously!

11:09.127 --> 11:10.628
Obviously.

11:10.712 --> 11:12.505
-Obvi.
-Okay, then I guess--

11:12.589 --> 11:13.923
Bye. See you later, buddy.

11:15.133 --> 11:17.468
I was skeptical,
but that was very impressive.

11:17.552 --> 11:19.929
I know.
And I threw in an extra tip for you.

11:20.013 --> 11:23.683
Call him "buddy," works every time.
'Cause who would lie to their buddy?

11:25.059 --> 11:27.729
I see the wisdom
of the Pants on Fire technique,

11:27.812 --> 11:30.023
but I wouldn't know where to start.

11:30.106 --> 11:34.569
That's easy. Start by lying to your ex,
because, so what? Can't dump you again.

11:34.652 --> 11:37.864
Can't be tried for the same crime twice.
No double jeopardy allowed.

11:37.947 --> 11:40.074
I do like an established legal precedent.

11:40.158 --> 11:42.368
Samesies.
You're gonna be just fine, my guy.

11:42.452 --> 11:43.828
Easy frickin' peasy.

11:50.251 --> 11:52.629
-Hi, Paige.
-Hey, Sam.

11:52.712 --> 11:56.341
I'm making a visual presentation
to pitch my senior gift idea to the PTA.

11:56.424 --> 11:57.717
-[ding]
-What's up?

11:59.719 --> 12:02.639
Paige, I love your giant hair bow.

12:04.557 --> 12:05.391
Really?

12:06.559 --> 12:08.394
You always hated this hair bow.

12:08.478 --> 12:10.438
[paper cutter whooshes]

12:11.481 --> 12:14.651
I see what's happening.
You want to get back together.

12:14.734 --> 12:17.320
And you know, Sam, it's just not our time.

12:17.779 --> 12:18.655
Obviously.

12:20.198 --> 12:21.407
Good, so you agree.

12:21.491 --> 12:22.992
Obviously.

12:23.952 --> 12:27.538
Yeah, I mean you seem... sure about that.

12:27.622 --> 12:28.831
Like, really sure.

12:29.791 --> 12:32.043
Um... Are you...

12:32.293 --> 12:34.379
Are you seeing someone else?

12:34.462 --> 12:35.755
Obviously.

12:36.839 --> 12:37.674
Really?

12:39.425 --> 12:41.135
Good, great.

12:41.719 --> 12:44.097
[angrily] I am so happy to hear that.

12:44.180 --> 12:47.892
So just to be clear, you're saying
you're being sexual with someone else.

12:48.476 --> 12:50.436
-Obviously.
-Okay.

12:50.520 --> 12:52.397
Bye. See you later, buddy.

12:52.647 --> 12:53.731
Good, yeah.

12:53.856 --> 12:58.695
That's just... That's wonderful.
That is wonderful. Wonderful. Wonderful.

12:58.778 --> 13:00.738
[paper cutter whooshes,
then stops abruptly]

13:05.535 --> 13:08.413
[screaming]

13:08.496 --> 13:10.498
[pants]

13:12.583 --> 13:14.294
Holy shit.

13:14.377 --> 13:16.170
Peg, you just cut your finger off.

13:17.005 --> 13:18.798
[shouts] My name is Paige!

13:18.923 --> 13:22.677
-[whimpers and faints]
-[thumps on floor]

13:22.844 --> 13:24.846
[students murmur]

13:28.433 --> 13:31.477
[coughs] Shit! Paige cut her finger off?

13:32.061 --> 13:33.771
-Just the tip.
-Damn.

13:34.355 --> 13:36.399
It was terrible. Lying is awful.

13:36.482 --> 13:38.735
Hey, now, let's not get hysterical.
Alright?

13:38.818 --> 13:41.321
I mean, finger loss is
an abnormal result of lying.

13:41.404 --> 13:44.991
I mean, you just gotta get back
on that horse, and...

13:45.074 --> 13:46.951
lie till the cows come home.

13:48.119 --> 13:50.955
Sorry, there's a farm scene
on my milk carton.

13:51.664 --> 13:53.374
Doesn't this cow look sad?

13:53.458 --> 13:55.668
-It does look a little bit sad.
-Yeah.

13:56.294 --> 13:58.546
-[inhales smoke]
-[door opens]

14:00.715 --> 14:03.051
Zahid, I see you with that pot.

14:03.134 --> 14:04.218
[Zahid] Shit.

14:07.638 --> 14:12.518
Oh, hey, Bob, looking lean,
sexy, sinewy.

14:12.643 --> 14:14.562
-What's up?
-Nice try, pal.

14:14.812 --> 14:18.441
That's the second time in a month.
That's strike two.

14:18.524 --> 14:20.610
Next is strike three, and then you're out.

14:20.693 --> 14:22.779
Or hit a home run and have sex.

14:24.364 --> 14:25.615
You don't know the bases?

14:28.201 --> 14:30.119
I'm really disappointed in you, Zahid.

14:30.203 --> 14:33.873
You're a natural leader.
I see so much potential in you.

14:34.457 --> 14:36.042
Why do you keep messing around?

14:36.125 --> 14:39.420
-Low self-esteem maybe?
-We all have low self-esteem.

14:40.004 --> 14:42.048
If I catch you doing this junk again...

14:42.131 --> 14:43.174
you're out of here.

14:43.257 --> 14:45.468
-Are we clear?
-We're clear.

14:50.056 --> 14:52.016
-Man, what a dick.
-I like him.

14:52.100 --> 14:54.519
Yeah, I know, me too.
He's just doing his job.

14:54.602 --> 14:55.561
Good guy.

14:57.897 --> 15:00.024
-[kids humming]
-Hey, Eddie? Good.

15:00.108 --> 15:02.860
-[whispering] This place is amazing.
-Nice spin, honey.

15:03.236 --> 15:05.988
They have so many classes
for kids on the spectrum.

15:06.072 --> 15:09.742
Yeah. Yep, and I've got two of them,
so I'm here all the time.

15:10.660 --> 15:14.247
[whispers] Hey, ladies. Tell me the truth.
How bad is Marco's haircut?

15:14.956 --> 15:16.916
He wouldn't sit still in the chair.

15:17.667 --> 15:21.045
-That's not so bad.
-No, I think it's really cute.

15:21.337 --> 15:23.506
I think it's one of the worst haircuts
I've ever seen.

15:23.840 --> 15:25.007
[whispers] Wow, brutal.

15:25.425 --> 15:26.759
No, no judgment.

15:26.843 --> 15:30.179
When Sam was little I could never
get him to sit still in the chair.

15:30.263 --> 15:32.432
I used to have to do all
of his cuts at home.

15:32.515 --> 15:34.434
Sometimes it would take all day.

15:34.517 --> 15:38.104
One time, he fell asleep mid-trim.

15:38.187 --> 15:41.941
So I just got down there on the floor
and finished.

15:42.024 --> 15:42.942
Oh, my God.

15:43.025 --> 15:45.570
Do you still cut hair for kids
on the spectrum?

15:45.653 --> 15:49.240
Because if you do I know a lot
of mamas that would be interested.

15:49.323 --> 15:53.494
-I mean, myself included.
-I mean, I do cut hair, but not...

15:55.371 --> 15:58.583
You know what?
Yeah, sure, I'll cut your son's hair.

15:58.666 --> 16:01.002
Great. How much do you charge?

16:01.085 --> 16:03.212
-Oh, no, I'm not gonna--
-Thirty-five bucks.

16:03.296 --> 16:06.966
Oh, my God. That's perfect. Remind me
to get your number before I leave today.

16:07.049 --> 16:08.342
-Okay?
-Okay, I will.

16:08.843 --> 16:12.054
See how I set your price?
I'm like your haircutting pimp.

16:12.138 --> 16:15.224
Any of these moms get rowdy,
I'm gonna bust some skulls.

16:18.644 --> 16:22.023
<i>...normally, I don't prepare it that way,</i>
<i>but right now I'm gonna let the beef...</i>

16:22.106 --> 16:24.317
Aren't you supposed to be working
on your college essay?

16:25.526 --> 16:28.279
No, I can't, I hate that essay.
Now, be quiet.

16:28.362 --> 16:30.239
-[door unlocks]
-Fine.

16:30.823 --> 16:33.576
[huffs] Pizza again?
That's the third time this week.

16:34.035 --> 16:34.994
He's in a mood.

16:35.077 --> 16:37.121
Well, if you feel like learning to cook,

16:37.205 --> 16:39.624
you're welcome to take up the mantle
of feeding the family.

16:40.041 --> 16:42.668
-No, thank you.
-Well, then, pizza is served.

16:43.836 --> 16:45.838
[mobile phone buzzes]

16:52.803 --> 16:54.805
-[typing]
-[huffs]

16:59.185 --> 17:00.061
[sighs]

17:02.355 --> 17:03.940
[penguins squawk]

17:04.065 --> 17:06.067
-[typing]
-[chuckles]

17:10.279 --> 17:12.281
[laughs loudly]

17:17.495 --> 17:19.497
[laughs]

17:21.290 --> 17:23.251
Oh, my God.

17:23.960 --> 17:25.211
Ugh!

17:25.336 --> 17:26.921
[shouts] Quiet! The penguins!

17:30.132 --> 17:33.177
-Sam Gardner is in a soundproof booth!
-Stop!

17:35.096 --> 17:37.098
[phone chimes]

17:37.848 --> 17:40.309
-[Sam] Just stop.
-[Casey] Stop!

17:40.643 --> 17:41.602
What's up?

17:41.686 --> 17:43.521
[Elsa] <i>Hey, I've been meaning to call you.</i>

17:43.604 --> 17:47.108
I just wanted to let you know
that Casey's grounded.

17:47.400 --> 17:50.069
So if you could just enforce that
at home, that would be great.

17:50.152 --> 17:51.862
Grounded? What happened?

17:52.154 --> 17:54.031
<i>I can't tell you.</i>

17:54.115 --> 17:58.077
I'm sorry. I'm really trying to be
more forthcoming lately, but...

17:59.161 --> 18:00.246
I promised her.

18:00.329 --> 18:02.999
So, can you just take my word for it?

18:03.082 --> 18:06.002
Oh, okay. You want me to trust you?

18:07.503 --> 18:08.671
<i>Yes?</i>

18:08.754 --> 18:10.172
Is that a joke?

18:10.965 --> 18:12.133
No.

18:12.216 --> 18:16.053
Okay, well, in the past, trusting you
hasn't worked out so well. I gotta go.

18:16.220 --> 18:18.431
[breaths deeply] Jesus.

18:20.766 --> 18:22.768
[continues breathing deeply]

18:26.147 --> 18:28.149
[heart beats loudly]

18:35.656 --> 18:37.992
Dad! What happened? Oh, my God!

18:38.075 --> 18:41.287
-Dad, are you okay?
-I'm fine. I'm fine.

18:42.204 --> 18:43.789
-Are you sure?
-I'm good.

18:43.873 --> 18:47.126
-Feels like something's going on.
-No, I just dropped the milk.

18:47.752 --> 18:50.463
Um, yeah. Here.

18:51.547 --> 18:54.925
-Here, let me do that.
-It's okay. It's okay.

18:55.009 --> 18:55.843
It's just...

18:55.926 --> 18:57.595
-It's okay.
-Jeez, it's a mess.

18:58.346 --> 18:59.221
Here.

19:04.810 --> 19:05.728
Elsa.

19:07.355 --> 19:08.773
Julia, hi.

19:11.025 --> 19:13.235
Oh, this is my brother, Jesse.

19:13.361 --> 19:15.404
-Jess, want to say hi?
-No, I do not.

19:15.488 --> 19:16.447
Okay.

19:17.573 --> 19:19.742
I'll meet you there in a sec. Okay, Jess?

19:21.243 --> 19:23.954
We're here for speech therapy
on the second floor.

19:24.997 --> 19:26.082
Anyway...

19:27.041 --> 19:29.543
-just wanted to say hi.
-Hi.

19:36.634 --> 19:38.010
[exhales] Elsa, I'm pregnant.

19:39.512 --> 19:42.556
Sorry, I don't know why I told you that.

19:43.432 --> 19:44.809
Actually, I do, um...

19:45.726 --> 19:47.895
I think it might be
why I lashed out at Sam.

19:48.479 --> 19:49.313
Or...

19:50.231 --> 19:52.358
maybe I'm just looking for a reason.

19:52.858 --> 19:54.276
Anyway, I just...

19:55.444 --> 19:57.780
[exhales]
I just wish I could take it all back.

19:59.949 --> 20:03.327
You know, I know I didn't always
make things easy for you, but...

20:04.036 --> 20:06.414
you were really good for Sam.

20:06.497 --> 20:07.873
You really helped him.

20:10.334 --> 20:11.293
Thank you.

20:11.752 --> 20:12.837
It's the truth.

20:14.046 --> 20:17.591
And being a mom, it's the best.

20:18.175 --> 20:19.760
[laughs]

20:19.844 --> 20:21.178
Congratulations, honey.

20:22.555 --> 20:23.514
Thank you.

20:26.475 --> 20:27.935
I should go.

20:28.394 --> 20:29.311
-Okay.
-Of course.

20:29.395 --> 20:31.689
-Yeah. Good to see you.
-You too.

20:41.073 --> 20:42.032
[lighter snaps]

20:42.158 --> 20:45.703
-What's up with Paige's finger?
-They sewed it back on, she's fine.

20:46.162 --> 20:47.037
That's too bad.

20:47.121 --> 20:50.791
It would have been so fun to leave it
around and just see what people say.

20:51.083 --> 20:52.001
Yep.

20:55.004 --> 20:56.297
Dang it, Zahid.

20:59.258 --> 21:01.761
That's strike three.
It's time to drop the hammer.

21:02.803 --> 21:03.637
Huh?

21:03.721 --> 21:06.474
-You're fired. You left me no choice.
-What?

21:06.557 --> 21:08.225
You can't do that. Please, Bob.

21:08.309 --> 21:11.061
Bob, wait, that's my marijuana.

21:11.145 --> 21:12.396
Also, nice shoes.

21:12.980 --> 21:15.566
Sam, you use marijuana?

21:16.233 --> 21:18.152
Like, for your autism?

21:18.235 --> 21:19.695
Obviously.

21:20.446 --> 21:21.530
Obviously.

21:22.656 --> 21:25.326
-Obvi.
-I find that very hard to believe.

21:25.409 --> 21:29.246
-Bye. See you later, buddy.
-Okay, hang on.

21:29.538 --> 21:30.498
I wasn't aware.

21:30.581 --> 21:35.002
So, just not
on Techtropolis property, okay?

21:35.085 --> 21:36.879
-Okay.
-[exhales softly] Okay.

21:38.214 --> 21:39.715
I'm still watching you, Zahid.

21:39.799 --> 21:42.218
Hey, with a face this pretty,
who can blame you?

21:46.931 --> 21:48.307
Dude, you did it!

21:48.390 --> 21:50.935
You used the Pants on Fire technique
and it worked.

21:51.018 --> 21:52.353
I mean, you're the king.

21:52.436 --> 21:55.981
Thanks, but I didn't like lying to Bob.
But I'm glad you get to keep your job.

21:56.065 --> 22:00.110
So, it's a bad feeling,
but a good feeling, too.

22:00.194 --> 22:04.782
That's how you know you're doing it right.
I could hug you, you magnificent bastard.

22:05.533 --> 22:06.867
Maybe just a small one.

22:08.911 --> 22:11.622
I like that we're secure enough
to do this semi-regularly.

22:11.705 --> 22:13.123
I'm neutral about it.

22:15.292 --> 22:17.253
Zahid, I think your pants are on fire.

22:18.170 --> 22:19.004
Oh, shit!

22:19.088 --> 22:21.924
Aah, aah! Ow!

22:23.592 --> 22:25.010
Take a video, take a video!

22:26.720 --> 22:30.140
[trembling voice] Hurry, I can feel
the burn. Horizontal, horizontal.

22:30.224 --> 22:33.060
-Should I AirDrop it to you?
-'Sup? I don't know, man.

22:33.143 --> 22:35.145
[in pain] Ow, ow, ow!

22:43.320 --> 22:45.322
[pants]

22:46.740 --> 22:48.075
Hi, Casey.

22:49.743 --> 22:51.287
Casey.

22:52.246 --> 22:53.539
Casey.

22:54.248 --> 22:55.499
Hey, Casey.

22:56.041 --> 22:57.293
Where'd you go?

22:57.543 --> 23:00.296
-You were here two seconds ago.
-I'm not here right now.

23:00.379 --> 23:03.007
All I see is this nose.
Guess I better mess with it.

23:03.090 --> 23:06.093
-Boop, boop, boop.
-[both laughing]

23:06.218 --> 23:09.388
Okay, you're letting this go on
a little bit longer than I expected.

23:09.471 --> 23:11.473
You're never gonna see my face again.

23:13.517 --> 23:16.145
This is going to be
our relationship now. Okay?

23:16.228 --> 23:20.608
-I hope that you can still love me.
-Look, I get it. You're embarrassed.
