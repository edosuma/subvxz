WEBVTT

00:03.679 --> 00:07.379
I felt like I had a lot of time.

00:07.380 --> 00:09.744
I know.

00:09.745 --> 00:13.711
It's good. I'm good.

00:13.712 --> 00:17.345
Yeah. We're, um... we're
just getting off the freeway.

00:17.346 --> 00:18.945
Yeah?

00:18.946 --> 00:21.412
Did, Hugh pick you up
at the office, or...

00:21.413 --> 00:24.012
Yeah, he was coming in from Oakland.

00:24.013 --> 00:27.544
He was late, of course.
Then I took him...

00:27.545 --> 00:31.944
And then, he took me
to some lawyer bar.

00:31.945 --> 00:33.810
A lawyer bar?

00:33.811 --> 00:36.577
Yeah. A lawyer bar, kind of.

00:36.578 --> 00:40.078
Yeah. I don't know. Everybody
there seemed like a lawyer.

00:40.079 --> 00:42.211
I felt like I was the only
person without a tie.

00:42.212 --> 00:45.811
Well, maybe we should get
you a tie for emergencies.

00:45.812 --> 00:47.345
Yeah, wardrobe emergencies.

00:47.346 --> 00:48.978
Yeah.

00:48.979 --> 00:53.678
Anyhow, we tried to take
the freeway and...

00:53.679 --> 00:56.444
Ke... Kevin?

00:56.445 --> 00:58.877
I can barely hear you.

00:58.878 --> 01:01.379
Is that better?

01:01.380 --> 01:03.444
Not much.

01:03.445 --> 01:06.311
Where are you?
Are you there yet?

01:06.312 --> 01:11.576
Yeah, I... I'm just
pulling up right now.

01:11.577 --> 01:15.181
I just got here.
Um...

01:15.979 --> 01:18.345
Yeah. I'm right here.

01:18.346 --> 01:22.544
I... You know what? I need to parallel
park and I'm not on my earpiece.

01:22.545 --> 01:24.411
Okay.

01:24.412 --> 01:26.578
Are you good?

01:26.579 --> 01:28.277
Yeah.

01:28.278 --> 01:30.378
You know, we should
talk about, you know...

01:30.379 --> 01:32.312
Maybe we can talk about, you know,

01:32.313 --> 01:35.178
that little problem before
we get into the party.

01:35.179 --> 01:37.178
Okay.

01:37.179 --> 01:41.478
Is it something we should
talk about now, or...

01:41.479 --> 01:43.410
Hello?

01:43.411 --> 01:45.345
Kevin?

01:45.346 --> 01:47.444
I lost you.

01:47.445 --> 01:49.112
Oh.

01:49.113 --> 01:51.678
Baby?

01:54.979 --> 01:58.646
You gotta be kidding me.

01:59.110 --> 02:01.844
I think olive oil would be good.
A little more maybe?

02:01.845 --> 02:03.312
- A drizzle.
- A little more.

02:03.313 --> 02:06.311
- Is this turning you on?
- That is hot.

02:06.312 --> 02:08.376
See how you're slipping?
This is...

02:08.377 --> 02:10.978
- It's... It's the bread, babe.
- It's the two of you with the knives that...

02:10.979 --> 02:13.011
I have not had carbs for a week.

02:13.012 --> 02:14.810
I've been on this...
this "cleanse."

02:14.811 --> 02:16.944
How long have you
been cleansing for?

02:16.945 --> 02:18.945
About 21 days.

02:18.946 --> 02:21.511
I had my juice and my
smoothie earlier today...

02:21.512 --> 02:23.943
and I do feel very, you know...

02:23.944 --> 02:26.844
- Cleansed? Open?
- A little faint maybe?

02:26.845 --> 02:28.409
But I'm gonna eat,

02:28.410 --> 02:30.145
I'm gonna drink and
have a good time.

02:30.146 --> 02:32.111
Hi.

02:32.112 --> 02:33.744
- Hey.
- How are you guys?

02:33.745 --> 02:36.010
Nice to see you.

02:36.011 --> 02:38.310
- Bend down to my level, please.
- I know.

02:38.311 --> 02:41.343
So, I just had Kevin on the
phone and this happened.

02:41.344 --> 02:42.943
It cracked.

02:42.944 --> 02:44.511
As I was talking to him.

02:44.512 --> 02:46.411
- You dropped it.
- Our connection... No, I didn't drop it.

02:46.412 --> 02:48.443
It just cracked as I was holding it.

02:48.444 --> 02:50.212
Do you have insurance?

02:50.213 --> 02:52.045
I... I actually don't know if I do.

02:52.046 --> 02:54.344
Do you have the Skype
app I showed you?

02:54.345 --> 02:57.244
No, I think it's fine. He just said
he wanted to talk about something,

02:57.245 --> 02:59.776
But on the news, you know,
they're talking about the comet.

02:59.777 --> 03:01.311
- Yeah.
- The Miller's Comet.

03:01.312 --> 03:04.211
And they keep telling people
that this can happen.

03:04.212 --> 03:05.877
Yeah. I don't think it's the comet.

03:05.878 --> 03:07.945
If you have Skype, it
uses the home Wi-Fi.

03:07.946 --> 03:10.978
No. The interference.
They're saying things break.

03:10.979 --> 03:14.680
Hey, do you want some wine?

03:17.178 --> 03:20.544
Did Amir mention to you that...

03:20.545 --> 03:23.278
he's bringing Laurie...

03:23.279 --> 03:25.678
to dinner?

03:25.679 --> 03:27.143
He's bringing Laurie?

03:27.144 --> 03:29.509
Yeah. The Laurie.

03:29.510 --> 03:33.510
Um, no, I didn't know that.
I didn't know that.

03:33.511 --> 03:34.978
- Who's Laurie?
- Well, he is.

03:34.979 --> 03:38.777
- You know Laurie.
- Oh, Mike.

03:38.778 --> 03:43.711
Long black hair.
Kind of vixeny.

03:43.712 --> 03:45.977
Wild and sexy.

03:45.978 --> 03:48.477
- Oh.
- Kinda strange, very mysterious.

03:48.478 --> 03:51.011
- Very tight, tight, tight dresses.
- Listen.

03:51.012 --> 03:53.710
It's totally fine.
It's such an Amir thing to do.

03:53.711 --> 03:55.310
I was going to keep this...

03:55.311 --> 03:57.343
This, my friends.

03:57.344 --> 04:01.245
It's my own little rescue
remedy concoction.

04:01.246 --> 04:03.810
- Right.
- It's our own mix.

04:03.811 --> 04:06.510
- It's pretty s... It's very safe, I think.
- Do you want a needle for that?

04:06.511 --> 04:09.011
- Is it clean?
- You can drop it into some water.

04:09.012 --> 04:11.011
Just take the edge off,
in case you're worried.

04:11.012 --> 04:13.045
I don't know.
I'm just... I'm offering.

04:13.046 --> 04:15.576
It's echinacea, passion
flower, a little valerian...

04:15.577 --> 04:17.043
and ketamine.

04:17.045 --> 04:19.411
- So it's all natural.
- Ketamine?

04:19.411 --> 04:21.844
That doesn't sound natural at all.
That's a horse tranquilizer.

04:21.845 --> 04:24.377
- Yeah, but it's just a whisper of ketamine.
- I did that once.

04:24.378 --> 04:26.377
I just thought maybe
a celebration...

04:26.378 --> 04:28.676
Are you offering this to me,
because Laurie's coming here?

04:28.677 --> 04:30.211
Well, I'm just saying...

04:30.212 --> 04:33.344
- Now it's a party.
- Ketamine or cheese?

04:33.345 --> 04:36.145
It's right here if you change
your mind. Oh, this is nice.

04:36.146 --> 04:37.812
Where'd you get this?

04:37.813 --> 04:39.244
Galaxy, that thrift store.

04:39.245 --> 04:41.577
- Oh, I love that place.
- Me too. I know.

04:41.578 --> 04:43.078
Oh. Hi.

04:43.079 --> 04:44.778
- Hi, baby.
- What?

04:44.779 --> 04:47.744
- Come on. Come here.
- All right.

04:47.745 --> 04:49.410
My wife.

04:49.411 --> 04:51.846
- Hi.
- Hey.

04:52.644 --> 04:54.477
- How are you?
- Hi. I'm good.

04:54.478 --> 04:56.145
- Hi.
- Hi.

04:56.146 --> 04:58.744
- Do you guys want wine?
- I do.

04:58.745 --> 05:00.947
Cheese? Ketamine?

05:01.745 --> 05:03.444
You look so good in leather.

05:03.445 --> 05:06.210
Jesus Christ.

05:06.211 --> 05:09.252
- Um...
- I want water or something.

05:11.946 --> 05:13.643
Did you know that, um,

05:13.644 --> 05:16.177
- Laurie is coming?
- There you go.

05:16.178 --> 05:18.677
No.

05:18.678 --> 05:20.309
- Laurie's coming?
- Yeah.

05:20.310 --> 05:22.177
Look at the smile on your face.

05:22.178 --> 05:24.978
- It's not a smile. It's not that smile.
- Oh, my God.

05:24.979 --> 05:27.276
- Why is she coming tonight?
- Amir's bringing her.

05:27.277 --> 05:30.077
Beats me, because
Amir's a total jackass.

05:30.078 --> 05:31.277
Oh.

05:31.278 --> 05:33.911
You know what? Put a quarter
into the swear jar.

05:33.912 --> 05:35.811
So, who did he tell?

05:35.812 --> 05:37.877
Well, we got the...
Yeah.

05:37.878 --> 05:40.011
We got an e-mail about it.
Just his plus one.

05:40.012 --> 05:44.149
Plus one and then I
was, like, plus what?

05:47.944 --> 05:50.243
I need to know tonight?

05:50.244 --> 05:53.810
My editor needs to know how
to book hotels and flights.

05:53.811 --> 05:57.547
I gotta do it.
Let them know.

05:58.345 --> 06:01.348
Gotta know tonight.

06:03.145 --> 06:05.112
You know I-I...
I can't...

06:05.113 --> 06:06.778
I-I just need to think about it...

06:06.779 --> 06:08.610
a little bit longer because...

06:08.611 --> 06:10.310
I just don't want to
make the wrong choice.

06:10.311 --> 06:11.878
What if you came for a shorter time?

06:11.879 --> 06:15.667
Like a month, not the full four months.
Just come for a month.

06:15.668 --> 06:17.444
It's still a very long time...

06:17.445 --> 06:19.011
and I'm not saying no.

06:19.012 --> 06:24.579
Babe, if you don't say
yes, it becomes a no.

06:26.077 --> 06:28.344
We're cold and hungry.

06:28.345 --> 06:30.309
Hello?

06:30.310 --> 06:32.110
- Hello.
- Hi.

06:32.111 --> 06:34.844
- Amir, you look great.
- Thank you.

06:34.845 --> 06:36.544
- Hi.
- You remember Laurie?

06:36.545 --> 06:38.269
Amir told me I wouldn't be...

06:38.270 --> 06:40.677
- overdressed, now I'm feeling...
- No. No, no.

06:40.678 --> 06:43.978
We're underdressed.

06:43.979 --> 06:45.777
- Hi.
- Hi.

06:45.778 --> 06:47.309
- How are you?
- I'm good.

06:47.310 --> 06:49.144
- Beth, do you remember Laurie?
- Yes.

06:49.145 --> 06:51.810
- Nice to see you.
- You guys already said hello and...

06:51.811 --> 06:53.476
How are you?
Good to see you.

06:53.477 --> 06:55.777
You guys want red wine?

06:55.778 --> 06:58.344
Yes. I would love red wine.

06:58.345 --> 07:00.810
- Lee?
- I've been cooking. I've been cooking.

07:00.811 --> 07:03.511
- How have you been?
- I've been good. I've been really good.

07:03.512 --> 07:05.577
- You?
- I've been great.

07:05.578 --> 07:09.143
Yeah. Life is looking very different
from how it was a while back.

07:09.144 --> 07:11.845
- In a good way, so...
- Well, cool. That's good to hear.

07:11.846 --> 07:15.913
- I would hope so. There you go.
- Thank you.

07:16.711 --> 07:18.477
Not A, C, E.

07:18.478 --> 07:20.110
"Horace, listen.

07:20.111 --> 07:22.810
I'll be down at the pyramid.
Come on down and join.

07:22.811 --> 07:24.878
We gotta talk about
some deity stuff."

07:24.879 --> 07:26.977
Does everyone else
still not have service?

07:26.978 --> 07:29.644
My phone is completely broken.

07:29.645 --> 07:32.911
I'm living in the moment, but...

07:32.912 --> 07:35.177
- Nothing.
- I got zero.

07:35.178 --> 07:37.910
That's weird.
Maybe the tower's down.

07:37.911 --> 07:39.944
The tower's down?

07:39.945 --> 07:42.044
I'm telling you guys...

07:42.045 --> 07:44.010
- It's not down.
- That would be a big news story.

07:44.011 --> 07:47.076
Comet. Comet.

07:47.077 --> 07:50.077
- Miller's Comet.
- Yes. Thank you.

07:50.078 --> 07:54.677
I read something this morning
about a comet in the 1930s.

07:54.678 --> 07:56.211
It was in Finland.

07:56.212 --> 07:58.043
- Knocked out all of the...
- I actually...

07:58.044 --> 08:00.510
the cell towers?

08:00.511 --> 08:03.877
Actually, it was in 1923.

08:03.878 --> 08:05.543
And, yes, it was in Finland.

08:05.544 --> 08:09.143
- Um...
- Thank you, Wikipedia.

08:09.144 --> 08:11.910
It was actually crazy,
because it affected the people.

08:11.911 --> 08:14.911
After it passed,
they would get lost.

08:14.912 --> 08:17.510
They would end up in the wrong home.
They would forget things.

08:17.511 --> 08:19.578
They wouldn't really
know where they were.

08:19.579 --> 08:22.209
And I remember reading
about this one woman...

08:22.210 --> 08:24.811
who called the police and said,

08:24.812 --> 08:27.670
"The man in my house
is not my husband."

08:27.671 --> 08:29.342
And then police came over...

08:29.343 --> 08:31.944
and they said,
"This is your husband,"

08:31.945 --> 08:33.544
And she said, "No. This
is not my husband.

08:33.544 --> 08:35.844
- I killed my husband yesterday.
- Awesome.

08:35.845 --> 08:37.544
That's how I know it's not him."

08:37.544 --> 08:40.177
But they couldn't arrest her,
because he was standing...

08:40.178 --> 08:41.910
right there in front in them.

08:41.912 --> 08:43.976
Do they have any theories of why?

08:43.977 --> 08:47.209
Think how lucky she is.
She gets to kill him again.

08:47.210 --> 08:48.843
Clearly she wants to kill this man.

08:48.844 --> 08:50.444
- It's just the Finnish.
- The Finns.

08:50.445 --> 08:52.376
The Finns or Finnish?

08:52.377 --> 08:54.911
- You guys remember Halley's Comet?
- Yes.

08:54.912 --> 08:56.578
I mean, it was such a big deal.

08:56.579 --> 09:00.243
I remember at my school, we all had
to, like, reenact Halley's Comet.

09:00.244 --> 09:04.143
So, they assigned each of us
something celestial to do.

09:04.144 --> 09:06.611
My sister got to be Halley's Comet.
I was very jealous.

09:06.612 --> 09:09.344
I've never met your sister.
Have you guys met her sister?

09:09.345 --> 09:11.678
There's a picture of her right
over there on the mantel, but...

09:11.679 --> 09:14.143
- She's only a fleeting comet.
- she looks a little ridiculous.

09:14.144 --> 09:15.943
- That's your sister?
- But why did you put it...

09:15.944 --> 09:17.644
It's the door to nowhere.

09:17.645 --> 09:19.478
In feng shui, a useless door,

09:19.479 --> 09:21.276
which this is obviously
a useless door,

09:21.277 --> 09:23.110
you put a picture of someone...

09:23.111 --> 09:24.977
you have unresolved issues with...

09:24.978 --> 09:27.277
and it causes all of
this weird energy flow.

09:27.278 --> 09:29.209
I don't even like being over here.

09:29.210 --> 09:31.976
- It's freaky.
- You shouldn't be over there then.

09:31.977 --> 09:33.543
- Every time you're...
- I'm sort of an empath.

09:33.544 --> 09:37.176
- Sort of an empath.
- And I can feel it. It's like a vortex.

09:37.177 --> 09:39.911
When was the last time we
were all together like this?

09:39.912 --> 09:42.043
I was thinking, right
before Thanksgiving,

09:42.044 --> 09:45.144
most of us were there, but
not everybody could be.

09:45.145 --> 09:46.777
I don't think Laurie...
Laura?

09:46.778 --> 09:48.311
- Laurie.
- Laurie.

09:48.312 --> 09:50.309
Sorry. We're gonna tell
all these stories.

09:50.310 --> 09:52.110
We do that when we get together.

09:52.111 --> 09:54.276
So Laurie, what are
you doing these days?

09:54.277 --> 09:56.443
- Well, I'm...
- Keeping yourself busy?

09:56.444 --> 09:57.943
I'm keeping busy.

09:57.944 --> 10:00.110
I'm actually working with some
outreach programs in Silicon Valley.

10:00.111 --> 10:02.210
We work with at-risk youth.

10:02.211 --> 10:04.909
Oh, wow. Didn't you...
No, no, no.

10:04.910 --> 10:06.911
Are you still teaching the yoga?

10:06.912 --> 10:09.077
The Spanish Yoga?
The Spoga?

10:09.078 --> 10:11.677
- No. Not me.
- Are you sure that...

10:11.678 --> 10:13.343
Oh, that must've
been another girl...

10:13.344 --> 10:16.644
that Kevin dated that
Amir is hooking up with.

10:16.645 --> 10:19.044
Wow. Let's give him a shovel.

10:19.045 --> 10:21.143
What are you doing?
What do you do for a living?

10:21.144 --> 10:24.077
I act. Shut up, guys.

10:24.078 --> 10:25.975
I didn't remember you were an actor.

10:25.976 --> 10:28.875
- So, you do mainly theater?
- Well, I did.

10:28.876 --> 10:33.511
Since I moved down here to support
my wife and her Skyping career.

10:33.512 --> 10:37.977
Um, but, no, I was in a TV
show for about four years.

10:37.978 --> 10:39.843
- Yeah? What was that?
- It was called Roswell.

10:39.844 --> 10:41.710
Oh, my God.
I love Roswell.

10:41.711 --> 10:44.778
When were you on Roswell?
What episodes were you on?

10:44.779 --> 10:47.511
I was on all shows.
Produced.

10:47.512 --> 10:49.976
- What do you mean?
- I was a series regular on that show.

10:49.977 --> 10:51.611
Yeah, he was, like, the main guy.

10:51.612 --> 10:53.111
What character did you play?

10:53.112 --> 10:56.710
- Joe.
- Did you have different hair, or something?

10:56.711 --> 10:58.276
I had the same exact hair.

10:58.277 --> 11:01.209
I'm sorry. Maybe it's one of
those things where you know...

11:01.210 --> 11:04.310
the character for so long, then you see
someone in person. It just doesn't compute.

11:04.311 --> 11:05.677
I don't know.

11:05.678 --> 11:11.377
- He's sort of grown into his face.
- You really have.

11:11.378 --> 11:12.942
Check it out again.

11:12.943 --> 11:16.043
I'm sure, you know, like the downward
dog probably gets to your head.

11:16.044 --> 11:18.311
- I didn't do yoga. That wasn't...
- Well, hey, listen.

11:18.312 --> 11:20.710
Thanks for enjoying the show.

11:20.711 --> 11:23.211
I think you are a
really good actor...

11:23.212 --> 11:24.843
and I think you should
continue doing it.

11:24.844 --> 11:28.043
- Thank you very much.
- I think it would be well worth your time.

11:28.044 --> 11:29.810
What are you up to these days?

11:29.811 --> 11:31.711
Last I remember, you were, like,

11:31.712 --> 11:34.042
taking the dance world by storm.

11:34.043 --> 11:36.077
Um, I guess the last
time I saw you...

11:36.078 --> 11:39.910
must've been when I was
creating the dance show.

11:39.945 --> 11:43.176
It was going really,
really well for a while,

11:43.177 --> 11:46.744
but then, right before
the, um... the premiere,

11:46.745 --> 11:49.310
they brought in Svetlana Aserrano...

11:49.311 --> 11:53.344
who is the best dancer
in the world really,

11:53.345 --> 11:55.410
and they just offered
me the understudy.

11:55.411 --> 11:57.210
She should've been the whole thing.

11:57.211 --> 11:58.943
She created it.
She should be...

11:58.944 --> 12:01.634
- the prima ballerina of the San Francisco Ballet.
- That's terrible.

12:01.635 --> 12:03.578
You know, you hear these
stories sometimes...

12:03.579 --> 12:06.810
about people being shut out
of things they created...

12:06.811 --> 12:09.410
and I think it's horrible.
I'm sorry.

12:09.411 --> 12:13.578
But I mean it's a good lesson
that I had to learn, because...

12:13.579 --> 12:16.010
You know, because of my
pride, I didn't want...

12:16.011 --> 12:18.143
to take the understudy
and I took too long...

12:18.144 --> 12:22.143
to think about it and then
I lost the understudy job.

12:22.144 --> 12:25.674
And they gave that to
Katherine Meriss and...

12:25.675 --> 12:26.810
And she sucks.

12:26.811 --> 12:28.477
- She sucks.
- No, she's good, guys.

12:28.478 --> 12:30.344
Anyways, the reason that
she's really big now...

12:30.345 --> 12:32.243
is because she ended up going up.

12:32.244 --> 12:33.909
Svetlana pulled out last minute...

12:33.910 --> 12:38.578
and Katherine ended
up doing the show.

12:38.579 --> 12:40.677
- Katherine Meriss?
- Exactly.

12:40.678 --> 12:42.676
As soon as you said that,
I thought, "Katherine Meriss...

12:42.677 --> 12:45.409
that's pretty much the only
person in dance I'd know."

12:45.410 --> 12:47.343
Right. Well...

12:47.344 --> 12:51.243
So, she basically stole
your... your whole thing?

12:51.244 --> 12:54.909
Katherine Meriss has
your life, basically.

12:54.910 --> 12:57.678
- Career.
- You have your life.

12:57.679 --> 13:00.411
It's a shame that it happened.
She doesn't hold a candle to you.

13:00.412 --> 13:03.743
Then, here's to the
life that we do lead.

13:03.744 --> 13:05.310
- Yeah.
- Well said.

13:05.311 --> 13:08.010
- Here's to the comet.
- The comet. And the comet.

13:08.011 --> 13:10.176
Anybody have a happier story?

13:10.177 --> 13:12.343
Kevin, tell a crazy story, first
one that comes in your head.

13:12.344 --> 13:14.843
No. All right.

13:14.844 --> 13:17.777
Um...
Sorry.

13:17.778 --> 13:19.310
I was going out with Laurie.

13:19.311 --> 13:21.976
We were drinking way
too much at a bar.

13:21.977 --> 13:24.478
I passed out and I
started dreaming...

13:24.479 --> 13:27.178
this big black bear...

13:27.179 --> 13:30.577
was up on its hind legs
sort of mauling me.

13:30.578 --> 13:33.311
Slowly. Tenderly.

13:33.312 --> 13:35.044
Anyhow, we go to some party...

13:35.045 --> 13:36.976
in Santa Cruz and as we walked in,

13:36.977 --> 13:39.344
this huge dog comes
running straight at me.

13:39.345 --> 13:41.876
Jumps up on its hind legs
and starts pawing me,

13:41.877 --> 13:45.276
exactly like the dream,
and this guy yells,

13:45.277 --> 13:49.809
- "Bear, get down, Bear."
- What?

13:49.810 --> 13:52.376
Wow.
You have a gift.

13:52.377 --> 13:54.511
The way you told that
story, I thought...

13:54.512 --> 13:56.510
somebody was going to die.

13:56.511 --> 13:59.510
You know Bear is the
most common dog name.

13:59.511 --> 14:03.444
Oh, that makes it a much
less interesting story.

14:03.445 --> 14:05.077
Thanks for that, Lee.

14:05.078 --> 14:08.613
Most common bear name? Henry.

14:09.411 --> 14:12.244
- Look.
- Oh, my God.

14:12.245 --> 14:14.377
- What?
- This is like your phone.

14:14.378 --> 14:16.476
Oh, my God. That happened
to my phone tonight.

14:16.477 --> 14:19.044
And I was just holding
mine in my hand.

14:19.045 --> 14:21.443
- Exact same thing.
- Shattered?

14:21.444 --> 14:23.776
Yeah. This is what they were
talking about on the news.

14:23.777 --> 14:25.577
Yeah. Yeah.
It must be the comet.

14:25.578 --> 14:27.977
- The chicken tastes like tuna.
- All right.

14:27.978 --> 14:30.710
It must be Miller's Comet.

14:30.711 --> 14:32.477
So, nobody's phone works?

14:32.478 --> 14:34.409
I haven't checked mine,
but I assume it doesn't.

14:34.410 --> 14:36.310
Everyone else's is
in the other room.

14:36.311 --> 14:40.844
- Do you guys have a landline?
- No. We're wireless, baby.

14:40.845 --> 14:45.211
All right. I need to get
ahold of my brother.

14:45.212 --> 14:47.809
- What about, um, your deal...
- The computer.

14:47.810 --> 14:49.309
- Good idea.
- It's in the office.

14:49.310 --> 14:51.042
- Could I?
- Yeah, yeah. Thanks.

14:51.043 --> 14:53.343
- What's wrong with your brother?
- Nothing. He's fine.

14:53.344 --> 14:56.709
He just, um...
You know Brian.

14:56.710 --> 14:59.409
He hangs out with all those, you
know, theoretical physicists.

14:59.410 --> 15:01.843
- No Internet.
- No?

15:01.844 --> 15:03.942
- On the computer.
- How is there no Internet?

15:03.943 --> 15:06.809
- You run Skype. You tell us.
- I know.

15:06.810 --> 15:09.476
What are they saying
about the comet?

15:09.477 --> 15:12.842
Nothing... Nothing
to get upset about.

15:12.843 --> 15:15.277
He just said to give him a call,

15:15.278 --> 15:17.278
you know, if there was
anything weird going on.

15:17.279 --> 15:19.110
Like, why? What did
he think it could do?

15:19.111 --> 15:20.743
Why didn't you tell me this?

15:20.744 --> 15:22.310
Because of your feng shui...

15:22.311 --> 15:24.776
- and granola candles, and I didn't want to...
- Stop making fun of me.

15:24.777 --> 15:26.276
I'm not making fun of you.

15:26.277 --> 15:27.909
There's a massive celestial object,

15:27.910 --> 15:29.410
and I didn't want to freak you out.

15:29.411 --> 15:31.010
- Now you're freaking me out.
- You guys realize...

15:31.011 --> 15:32.477
I was on a show called Roswell...

15:32.478 --> 15:35.044
and we tackled these
issues every week.

15:35.045 --> 15:37.609
That's true.

15:37.610 --> 15:39.477
- Oh, shit.
- Oh, my God.

15:39.478 --> 15:41.443
- Honey.
- Um, I'm on it.

15:41.444 --> 15:43.042
Do we have candles?

15:43.043 --> 15:44.545
I'm so glad I'm not high.

15:44.546 --> 15:48.109
I don't want to sit by
the door to nowhere.

15:48.110 --> 15:51.710
Mike, check the breakers.

15:51.711 --> 15:54.143
I'm going to turn the lighter
on then come to you.

15:54.144 --> 15:57.009
- You guys need help?
- No. I have matches.

15:57.010 --> 15:59.677
- Candle power?
- I've got some over here.

15:59.678 --> 16:03.176
I got blue glowsticks, red
glowsticks and green glowsticks.

16:03.177 --> 16:05.942
Guys, let's just
light candles and...

16:05.943 --> 16:07.910
Oh.

16:07.911 --> 16:10.010
- Hey.
- Everybody rave.

16:10.011 --> 16:11.944
- Are you going outside?
- Yeah.

16:11.945 --> 16:13.444
What do you mean,
you're going outside?

16:13.445 --> 16:17.694
I'm gonna see if the power's
off in the whole neighborhood.

16:22.044 --> 16:24.842
I decided this is where mine goes.

16:24.843 --> 16:26.710
Well, this is a little strange,

16:26.711 --> 16:28.576
but the whole neighborhood is out...

16:28.577 --> 16:31.575
of power, except for a
house about two blocks up,

16:31.576 --> 16:33.077
which is completely lit up.

16:33.078 --> 16:34.809
It's kind of beautiful, actually.

16:34.810 --> 16:37.543
- The house?
- I want to go see.

16:37.544 --> 16:41.277
- Let's go check it out.
- I've never seen it so dark outside before.

16:41.278 --> 16:43.543
- You can't leave me. I'm gonna go.
- Come on then.

16:43.544 --> 16:45.009
Don't leave me by myself.

16:45.010 --> 16:48.110
- Where?
- You don't see it?

16:48.111 --> 16:50.710
- It's right there.
- Why are you so far ahead of everyone?

16:50.711 --> 16:52.744
Amir, dude, I can't see you.

16:52.745 --> 16:54.776
- Let Laurie go first.
- Thanks a lot.

16:54.777 --> 16:57.777
- That's sweet.
- Baby. Don't go.

16:57.778 --> 16:59.742
- Come here.
- See? Look.

16:59.743 --> 17:03.014
- Everything done.
- Come here.

17:04.810 --> 17:07.309
See that?

17:07.310 --> 17:09.676
- Two blocks down.
- Oh, they have light.

17:09.678 --> 17:12.476
- That one house has light.
- They must have a...

17:12.477 --> 17:14.109
- A generator, or something?
- Yeah, yeah.

17:14.111 --> 17:15.742
What is that, two blocks away?

17:15.742 --> 17:17.242
Could solar power do that?

17:17.243 --> 17:19.642
But would their landline be working?

17:19.643 --> 17:21.109
Oh, wow.
Look at that.

17:21.111 --> 17:24.510
- Oh, wow.
- It's magnificent.

17:24.511 --> 17:27.146
Holy moly.

17:29.943 --> 17:31.476
Well, I'm freezing.

17:31.477 --> 17:33.177
Should we head over
there, or should we...

17:33.178 --> 17:36.481
- No.
- Maybe we should head back inside.

17:38.978 --> 17:41.677
That was awesome, right?

17:42.371 --> 17:44.842
- I didn't even see this get knocked over.
- No.

17:44.843 --> 17:46.644
I didn't even know that
glass was out here.

17:46.645 --> 17:48.210
I never go down into the basement.

17:48.211 --> 17:51.177
Guys, listen. Seriously,
what's up with that house?

17:51.178 --> 17:52.909
- Why are they...?
- What?

17:52.910 --> 17:54.475
It could be a generator.

17:54.476 --> 17:55.378
Really?

17:55.379 --> 17:57.976
I don't know. Maybe they're
just off-the-grid bastard...

17:57.977 --> 17:59.509
Well, apparently,
we have a generator.

17:59.510 --> 18:01.443
That would make sense if
they were off the grid.

18:01.444 --> 18:05.542
I'm actually thinking of...
of going over there.

18:05.543 --> 18:07.176
What?

18:07.177 --> 18:09.810
- No, you're not going over there.
- Honey, it's okay.

18:09.811 --> 18:12.276
- It's o...
- It's ridiculous.

18:12.277 --> 18:14.809
It's not that far.
Look, look, look, look.

18:14.810 --> 18:17.242
My brother, he says...

18:17.243 --> 18:20.943
he said that if... if anything
strange were to happen...

18:20.944 --> 18:23.310
while the comet was passing over...

18:23.311 --> 18:26.643
- that we should stay inside.
- What?

18:26.644 --> 18:28.344
Just hold on, Amir.

18:28.345 --> 18:31.976
That we should stay inside and that
I should do my best to contact him.

18:31.977 --> 18:33.475
And so that's all that I'm doing.

18:33.476 --> 18:37.643
He said if anything strange
should happen? I mean...

18:37.644 --> 18:40.443
I'm not the only one who
thinks this is strange.

18:40.444 --> 18:42.376
- What is weird?
- Didn't he say to stay inside though?

18:42.377 --> 18:44.442
What's more important
than the other?

18:44.443 --> 18:47.344
Yes, but this overrides that,
and it's only two blocks away.

18:47.345 --> 18:49.543
I'll be back in, like, five minutes.

18:49.544 --> 18:52.310
- Well, then you can't go by yourself.
- I'm going with him.

18:52.311 --> 18:54.977
There you go.
I'll take Amir.

18:54.978 --> 18:57.343
- I'm the least important person here.
- This is true.

18:57.344 --> 18:59.076
It's about time you
started realizing that.

18:59.077 --> 19:01.810
- Just stay here.
- Why are you going now?

19:01.811 --> 19:04.310
Well, bring your glowsticks so
we can identify your bodies.

19:04.311 --> 19:06.744
- Good idea.
- Thanks. That helps a lot.

19:06.745 --> 19:08.743
- Don't listen to them.
- That's great.

19:08.744 --> 19:10.244
Five minutes, all right?

19:10.245 --> 19:11.976
- Okay. Five minutes.
- All right. Okay.

19:11.977 --> 19:13.777
Beth, I-I couldn't find my shoes.

19:13.778 --> 19:15.244
I'm borrowing yours.
I'm sorry.

19:15.245 --> 19:18.080
That's so Amir.

19:18.878 --> 19:22.011
- Ten minutes we give them.
- They will be fine.

19:22.012 --> 19:25.177
We're just rattled because we're
addicted to cell phones and Internet.

19:25.178 --> 19:27.409
We are. What did we do
before cell phones?

19:27.410 --> 19:30.877
Em, you seem to be the
comet expert here tonight.

19:30.878 --> 19:32.442
What happened the last time?

19:32.443 --> 19:35.409
This one passed over a hundred
years ago, but much farther.

19:35.410 --> 19:37.810
But do we know that
anything happened?

19:37.811 --> 19:40.210
Nothing happened then.
It was too far away.

19:40.211 --> 19:41.910
So, is there any reason...

19:41.911 --> 19:43.410
we should be freaked out right now?

19:43.411 --> 19:46.876
Well, I mean, it is a
lot closer this time.

19:46.877 --> 19:48.776
What does that mean?

19:48.777 --> 19:50.609
Okay. I read one more thing.

19:50.610 --> 19:53.376
- Oh, another story.
- Just one more.

19:53.377 --> 19:55.142
It's called the Tunguska Event...

19:55.143 --> 19:58.177
and, um, it was a comet...

19:58.178 --> 20:00.077
or a meteor or
something like that...

20:00.078 --> 20:02.742
that entered the
atmosphere over Siberia...

20:02.743 --> 20:05.576
and exploded over Earth.

20:05.577 --> 20:08.077
So, it didn't actually
have physical impact.

20:08.078 --> 20:10.010
It didn't touch Earth.

20:10.011 --> 20:11.643
It didn't leave a
crater or anything,

20:11.644 --> 20:14.076
but the force of that explosion...

20:14.077 --> 20:17.877
flattened trees for
hundreds of miles.

20:17.878 --> 20:21.143
But it only killed about
one to two people.

20:21.144 --> 20:24.076
It's Siberia. There were
probably only two people there.

20:24.077 --> 20:25.676
Yeah, but they don't necessarily...

20:25.677 --> 20:28.143
- It wiped out the population of Siberia.
- Basically. Yeah.

20:28.144 --> 20:29.876
- Right.
- Well, that doesn't make me feel better.

20:29.877 --> 20:31.710
And when was this?

20:31.711 --> 20:35.044
It was, like, in 1908, 1903...

20:35.311 --> 20:38.276
Oh, my God, oh, my God,
oh, my God. What is...

20:38.277 --> 20:41.777
- What the fuck was that?
- I don't know.

20:41.778 --> 20:43.811
- Lock that front door.
- Don't open the door.

20:43.812 --> 20:45.909
- I'm gonna get the bat.
- Yeah. Give me the bat.

20:45.910 --> 20:47.542
Mike, is that door locked?

20:47.543 --> 20:49.643
- I'll check it.
- Babe, stay away from the door.

20:49.644 --> 20:51.276
- You need the stick?
- Thank you.

20:51.277 --> 20:53.976
No, no, no.

20:54.343 --> 20:58.042
- I just want to see what the hell is out there.
- Oh, my God.

20:58.043 --> 21:00.543
- Don't open it.
- Oh, God.

21:00.544 --> 21:03.545
Please, don't open that.

21:04.059 --> 21:07.109
- Is anybody there?
- Front door's locked. There's nothing.

21:07.110 --> 21:08.844
There's nothing out there.

21:08.845 --> 21:10.642
Thought I was going to
have a heart attack.

21:10.643 --> 21:12.476
Everybody all right?

21:12.477 --> 21:15.443
Check the generator, please.
Please try the generator.

21:15.444 --> 21:17.277
- I'll check the generator.
- Would the guys do that?

21:17.278 --> 21:19.276
No. The guys would not
do anything like that.

21:19.277 --> 21:20.977
They're not stupid.
They wouldn't do that.

21:20.978 --> 21:22.642
- How long have they been gone?
- Like ten minutes.

21:22.643 --> 21:25.342
Five minutes out, five minutes back.
They should be back by now.

21:25.343 --> 21:27.077
So, they should be back by now.

21:27.078 --> 21:29.576
- Okay. I think we should go get them.
- No, no, no.

21:29.577 --> 21:31.076
I want to go get my husband.

21:31.077 --> 21:32.976
We need to do it together
this time, guys.

21:32.977 --> 21:34.710
That's fine with me.
I just want to go.

21:34.711 --> 21:37.977
- Don't go outside.
- I'm not going anywhere. I'm just...

21:37.978 --> 21:42.776
We should go get them.
We can all go together.

21:42.777 --> 21:45.844
Okay, all right.
This is good.

21:45.845 --> 21:48.276
Is that the grid or the generator?

21:48.277 --> 21:50.209
No, it's just us.
He must have gotten it going.

21:50.210 --> 21:51.744
There's no other lights on?
It's just us?

21:51.745 --> 21:55.976
- It's pitch black out there. At least it's on.
- So it must be...

21:55.977 --> 21:57.675
- Well done.
- Thank you.

21:57.676 --> 22:00.143
- You did it.
- Let there be light.

22:00.144 --> 22:03.408
Okay. Well, I think
that we should...

22:03.409 --> 22:06.309
As a group, we should
go find those guys.

22:06.310 --> 22:09.442
- I agree.
- Let's do it as a group this time.

22:09.443 --> 22:11.176
No. That's ridiculous.

22:11.177 --> 22:13.208
If you get lost in the
woods, you're supposed...

22:13.209 --> 22:15.175
to stay where you are until
someone can find you.

22:15.176 --> 22:17.576
Fine. That's great. Let's
just sit down and breathe.

22:17.577 --> 22:21.011
For once, I actually agree
with what you're saying.

22:21.012 --> 22:23.275
You know what? You've been
giving me shit all night.

22:23.276 --> 22:27.278
- I am agreeing with you.
- Guys, guys, guys.

22:28.077 --> 22:29.877
I don't like any of this.

22:29.878 --> 22:33.643
Jesus!

22:33.644 --> 22:35.309
Stay.

22:35.310 --> 22:37.712
Oh, my God.

22:38.510 --> 22:41.080
Oh man, it's them.

22:41.740 --> 22:43.844
- What the hell happened?
- Are you okay?

22:43.845 --> 22:47.442
- I'm fine, I'm fine.
- Are you okay?

22:47.443 --> 22:50.110
What is this?

22:50.643 --> 22:53.675
- What's the box?
- That was at the other house.

22:53.676 --> 22:55.210
I thought I saw Hugh put it down.

22:55.211 --> 22:57.043
Then he was running
around the corner and...

22:57.044 --> 22:59.176
- You just took it?
- I just followed him.

22:59.177 --> 23:01.342
- I didn't... I had it in my hand.
- Why was he running?

23:01.343 --> 23:03.876
- Hugh, what happened?
- I'm fine, I'm fine.

23:03.877 --> 23:07.409
- Did you put this down?
- Amir, why the fuck did you take that?

23:07.410 --> 23:10.208
- I thought I saw you put it down.
- I did not touch that thing.

23:10.209 --> 23:12.643
I don't know what that is
or why you grabbed it.

23:12.644 --> 23:16.009
- Guys, what happened?
- Okay. We were at the other house.

23:16.010 --> 23:18.610
Hugh went around the side.
I thought I heard a noise.

23:18.611 --> 23:21.209
You made some kind of sound, and
then you saw what? Something.

23:21.210 --> 23:22.743
You won't tell me what you saw.

23:22.744 --> 23:25.876
I don't understand what's going on.
What did you see?

23:25.877 --> 23:27.376
- I don't...
- What did you see?

23:27.377 --> 23:29.043
That has nothing to
do with anything...

23:29.044 --> 23:30.643
that we should be
fucking concerned with.

23:30.644 --> 23:32.442
What did you see?

23:32.443 --> 23:35.676
- It's not a big deal. I'll walk it back.
- Okay, fine.

23:35.677 --> 23:37.310
Wait. Let me open it first.

23:37.311 --> 23:39.210
No, Mike.
What are you doing?

23:39.211 --> 23:42.175
- What is it?
- I don't know. I don't know.

23:42.176 --> 23:44.709
You don't want to talk about it
and you don't want to open...

23:44.710 --> 23:47.842
Fine! Open the fucking box!
Open the box. What do I care?

23:47.843 --> 23:49.710
What is wrong?
Calm down.

23:49.711 --> 23:52.543
What happened?

23:52.544 --> 23:55.209
Holy shit, it worked.

23:55.210 --> 23:56.744
I got it.

23:56.745 --> 23:58.275
Open it away from your face.

23:58.276 --> 24:00.777
- It's not a bomb.
- How do you know what the heck it is?

24:00.778 --> 24:04.647
- Don't freak out.
- Be careful.

24:06.444 --> 24:09.809
Oh, my God, It's a ping-pong paddle.
It's a ping-pong paddle.

24:09.810 --> 24:14.015
- Well, what's that?
- What is going on?

24:16.811 --> 24:19.675
- Oh, my God.
- What is it?

24:19.676 --> 24:23.746
These are pictures of all of us.

24:24.544 --> 24:27.810
These are...

24:27.811 --> 24:30.308
- Somebody's marked us.
- I want to try to figure this out.

24:30.309 --> 24:32.241
- This is insane.
- And there are numbers on the back.

24:32.242 --> 24:34.142
- Hugh.
- Baby, what did you see?

24:34.143 --> 24:35.976
- Hugh what did you see?
- What did you see?

24:35.977 --> 24:37.609
Jesus Christ, man.

24:37.610 --> 24:42.379
You can't stand there and not
say anything! What did you see?

24:43.177 --> 24:45.877
Hugh!

24:45.878 --> 24:48.410
There are pictures
of us in this box!

24:48.411 --> 24:51.452
Hugh!

24:59.243 --> 25:02.476
I went to the window,
and I looked in the window.

25:02.477 --> 25:04.909
And I saw a table...

25:04.910 --> 25:08.809
with wine glasses and candles...

25:08.810 --> 25:13.842
and dinner set for eight people.

25:13.843 --> 25:17.479
I saw...

25:18.277 --> 25:19.809
Oh, my God.

25:19.810 --> 25:21.910
Right.
Okay, fuck you, Hugh.

25:21.911 --> 25:23.577
- I saw...
- Bullshit.

25:23.578 --> 25:26.709
- Did you guys come and fuck with this door?
- Fuck you, Kevin.

25:26.710 --> 25:28.123
Did you come to the side door?

25:28.124 --> 25:30.109
No. You went to the side
door at the other house.

25:30.110 --> 25:31.877
They wouldn't answer
the door, so I went...

25:31.878 --> 25:33.476
Bullshit.

25:33.477 --> 25:36.677
You dipshits walked in a circle
and knocked on this door.

25:36.678 --> 25:39.276
I did not walk in a fucking circle!
I went two blocks.

25:39.277 --> 25:41.410
We went up to that house.
I knocked at the door.

25:41.411 --> 25:44.143
Nobody answered, so I went
and banged on the side door.

25:44.144 --> 25:46.643
- Did you see yourself, Hugh?
- No, I did not see myself.

25:46.644 --> 25:50.609
- No, because you weren't there.
- I did not go in a circle!

25:50.610 --> 25:52.944
Fuck.
Just calm down.

25:52.945 --> 25:54.476
I don't believe this.

25:54.477 --> 25:56.076
This still doesn't
explain the pictures.

25:56.077 --> 25:57.742
What's on the back of them?

25:57.743 --> 25:59.743
Numbers.

25:59.744 --> 26:05.210
They're all...
We've got two, one, one.

26:05.211 --> 26:07.710
That's five.

26:07.711 --> 26:10.743
- Whoa, whoa, whoa. Where are you going?
- I'm gonna go back over there.

26:10.744 --> 26:13.710
- Whoa.
- No, no, no. Think about it.

26:13.711 --> 26:16.108
I'm gonna go back over there. I'm
gonna ask to use their phone...

26:16.109 --> 26:17.876
and, hopefully, I can get
in touch with my brother.

26:17.877 --> 26:19.763
And if they're not there,
I'll just leave a note. Right?

26:19.764 --> 26:20.743
No.

26:20.744 --> 26:22.243
No, no, no. That makes sense. Right?

26:22.244 --> 26:24.710
- You should not go back.
- It's fine. It'll be fine.

26:24.711 --> 26:27.779
It'll be fucking fine.

26:29.576 --> 26:32.347
What's a note going to do?

26:35.143 --> 26:39.743
If these people have pictures
of us, they might be crazy.

26:39.744 --> 26:41.141
Shit! There's someone out there.

26:41.142 --> 26:42.777
There's someone out there.

26:42.778 --> 26:45.276
- What?
- Oh, my God.

26:45.277 --> 26:47.075
Oh, there's a big guy at the door.

26:47.076 --> 26:49.110
- Oh, my God.
- At the door?

26:49.111 --> 26:50.709
What should we do?

26:50.710 --> 26:52.310
He's walking away. He's walking away.
Please, please.

26:52.311 --> 26:55.352
Baby, please be careful.
Oh, my God.

27:00.444 --> 27:01.943
- Baby.
- Careful.

27:01.944 --> 27:05.116
- Shit.
- What?

27:10.909 --> 27:14.511
What is it, babe?

27:15.309 --> 27:19.743
"Hey, there. Don't mean
to freak you guys out,

27:19.744 --> 27:24.343
but we just wanted to borrow
your phone for five minutes tops.

27:24.344 --> 27:27.120
Thanks."

27:34.911 --> 27:36.743
Two kinds.

27:36.744 --> 27:39.877
Regular Band-Aid or cloth?

27:40.676 --> 27:42.942
Whatever.

27:42.943 --> 27:46.743
Cloth. Okay. Here we go.

27:46.744 --> 27:49.443
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

27:49.444 --> 27:54.777
These are ones. This is a two.
We are four, five, six.

27:54.778 --> 27:56.810
Do you have any red markers?

27:56.811 --> 28:01.410
Okay. Why are these three ones?

28:01.411 --> 28:04.276
- This is a six. Five.
- Hugh and Lee.

28:04.277 --> 28:06.476
Two.

28:07.210 --> 28:09.010
Four.

28:09.011 --> 28:10.942
And that's the same picture.

28:10.943 --> 28:14.778
Oh, my God.

28:15.576 --> 28:18.281
Somebody cut that in half.

28:21.077 --> 28:23.109
Where are these from?

28:23.110 --> 28:26.008
Could this be like numerology?

28:26.009 --> 28:28.710
Like if you add up
all the numbers...

28:28.711 --> 28:30.410
in your name and the birthday...

28:30.411 --> 28:32.543
Like life path numbers
or something like that?

28:32.544 --> 28:35.075
If that's the case, then they're just
crazy and it doesn't matter anyway.

28:35.076 --> 28:37.242
So, what do all the
ones have in common?

28:37.243 --> 28:40.175
Um, we have Lee...
Date of birth?

28:40.176 --> 28:42.142
- Oldest to youngest?
- There's no three?

28:42.143 --> 28:44.409
- There's no three.
- There's no three.

28:44.410 --> 28:48.309
Is there someone... Is there
someone that would want to be...

28:48.310 --> 28:49.875
doing this to us?

28:49.876 --> 28:53.176
Is there someone that is
on someone's bad side?

28:53.177 --> 28:56.109
What?
This was taken tonight.

28:56.110 --> 28:59.175
What? How do you know that?

28:59.176 --> 29:04.278
I bought this sweater today,
so that's from tonight.

29:05.076 --> 29:08.310
Has anyone taken a
picture of you tonight?

29:08.311 --> 29:11.176
Someone took a picture of you
when you were looking at the box.

29:11.177 --> 29:12.976
You were looking into the lens.

29:12.977 --> 29:15.376
But then it was already in the box.

29:15.377 --> 29:18.542
What is that?

29:18.543 --> 29:20.075
I can't tell what that is.

29:20.076 --> 29:22.176
There's dots on the wall
and there's a lampshade.

29:22.177 --> 29:24.042
None of the others are
from tonight. Right?

29:24.043 --> 29:26.876
No. This our picture.
This is from last fall.

29:26.877 --> 29:29.442
- This picture of Amir was taken over here.
- How do you know that?

29:29.443 --> 29:31.676
- He's standing in front of this drum.
- Guys, hang on.

29:31.677 --> 29:33.075
I can't figure out what this is.

29:33.076 --> 29:34.842
It's taken from the door?

29:34.843 --> 29:36.242
So, from behind the curtain?

29:36.243 --> 29:37.776
It's taken from over there.

29:37.777 --> 29:40.442
Wait. When someone knocked
on the door, were you there?

29:40.443 --> 29:42.208
You were gone.

29:42.209 --> 29:45.611
But you're looking
right at the camera.

29:46.409 --> 29:50.276
So, it would be from
that door, then. Right?

29:50.277 --> 29:52.043
You don't remember... I mean,

29:52.044 --> 29:54.842
this is you, man. This is you.

29:54.843 --> 29:58.442
Guys, this isn't going
to solve anything.

29:58.443 --> 29:59.976
What're you doing?

29:59.977 --> 30:02.575
I need a drink.
I need something.

30:02.576 --> 30:04.443
The... The pictures?

30:04.444 --> 30:07.584
All right. Me too.

30:13.377 --> 30:16.309
It looks like my handwriting, babe.

30:16.310 --> 30:19.514
Look at this.

30:22.709 --> 30:24.741
It looks like I wrote this.

30:24.742 --> 30:26.741
Okay, relax.

30:26.742 --> 30:29.675
You're starting to freak me out.

30:29.676 --> 30:33.114
That's your handwriting.

30:35.910 --> 30:38.480
What is going on?

30:41.276 --> 30:44.651
I feel like I'm losing my mind.

30:50.370 --> 30:52.841
I can't stop thinking about
the fact that you...

30:52.842 --> 30:58.909
brought up a story you
shared with Laurie.

30:58.910 --> 31:02.009
Of all the stories
that you could've...

31:02.010 --> 31:04.142
All the experiences
that we've shared,

31:04.143 --> 31:05.875
you brought up a story about her?

31:05.876 --> 31:08.176
- I am so sorry.
- In front of everyone.

31:08.177 --> 31:11.009
It's a crazy story. We don't
have stories like that.

31:11.010 --> 31:12.942
Oh, they're not crazy
enough for you.

31:12.943 --> 31:15.410
Baby, it's a good thing.
Oh, God.

31:15.411 --> 31:17.509
I don't need crazy stories
like that anymore.

31:17.510 --> 31:21.277
All right. Hey, um, fuck this.
Let's just... Let's go.

31:21.278 --> 31:23.076
I'm gonna go over there
and, theoretically,

31:23.077 --> 31:25.508
let's go see if our
theoretical selves are there.

31:25.509 --> 31:27.142
No, no, no.
I'm going.

31:27.143 --> 31:30.542
I'm in. There's some weird
stuff happening here.

31:30.543 --> 31:32.108
I think we should...

31:32.109 --> 31:33.576
- I think we should evaluate...
- Please, can we...

31:33.577 --> 31:35.543
- I just evaluated and I'm going.
- Can we stay here?

31:35.544 --> 31:38.075
- If there's another me, I want to see me.
- No. No way.

31:38.076 --> 31:39.809
- No, no.
- Let's go.

31:39.810 --> 31:41.309
- Look.
- I'm over this.

31:41.310 --> 31:43.143
I'm getting sick of
talking about it.

31:43.144 --> 31:44.642
I'm getting sick of
writing about it.

31:44.643 --> 31:47.342
- The same fucking paper, the pictures...
- Wait.

31:47.343 --> 31:49.377
There's nobody trying to hurt us.

31:49.378 --> 31:51.509
We go find out what
the hell is going on.

31:51.510 --> 31:54.442
What about you? You were
the one who wanted to go.

31:54.443 --> 31:57.309
That's when I thought
they might have a phone.

31:57.310 --> 32:01.542
Four glowsticks. Can we
please keep two guys here?

32:01.543 --> 32:03.942
- Two guys staying here? Please?
- I'm staying, I'm staying.

32:03.943 --> 32:06.310
Are you going?
Amir, please.

32:06.311 --> 32:08.042
Let's go.

32:08.043 --> 32:09.675
So, what? We're splitting up again?

32:09.676 --> 32:11.242
No. We're not splitting up.

32:11.243 --> 32:14.008
We're just gonna go in two
different groups. Oh. Okay.

32:14.009 --> 32:15.909
Sticks, sticks, sticks.

32:15.910 --> 32:17.609
Do we need a towel on it?

32:17.610 --> 32:19.841
I'm coming.
Wait.

32:19.842 --> 32:22.041
Chill for a second.
I'm coming.

32:22.042 --> 32:23.909
- Why?
- Because I want to go.

32:23.910 --> 32:26.447
I'm going with Kevin.

32:29.243 --> 32:31.976
- Give us 20 minutes.
- All right.

32:31.977 --> 32:34.476
- And then what?
- Are we taking the bat?

32:34.477 --> 32:37.109
No. We'll be fine. You will be fine.
It's gonna be all right.

32:37.110 --> 32:40.086
We'll find out what's going on.

32:47.877 --> 32:52.229
No cars. No people.
There's nothing.

33:11.009 --> 33:13.208
Guys, look.

33:13.843 --> 33:17.210
That's my house.

33:17.211 --> 33:21.679
Mike.
This is my house.

33:23.477 --> 33:25.276
Mike, this isn't right.

33:25.277 --> 33:27.741
Mike, this is not your house.

33:27.742 --> 33:30.746
Mike.

33:31.544 --> 33:33.775
- My house.
- This is not your house, Mike.

33:33.776 --> 33:36.975
Mike.
This is not your house.

33:36.976 --> 33:40.978
What is he doing?
Kevin.

33:41.776 --> 33:46.475
I see... I see Lee.
Guys.

33:46.476 --> 33:49.909
We have to go. Let's
get out of here now.

33:49.910 --> 33:51.874
Mike, we need to get
the hell out of here.

33:51.875 --> 33:53.775
Someone's coming.

33:53.776 --> 33:57.295
Someone's coming.
Go. Just go.

34:40.842 --> 34:43.245
That's just nuts.

34:45.042 --> 34:47.841
So, you saw four
figures, same as you?

34:47.842 --> 34:50.940
Except they had red glowsticks.

34:50.942 --> 34:52.876
Who had red glowsticks?

34:52.877 --> 34:54.674
They had the red glowsticks.

34:54.675 --> 34:57.474
We had the blue glowsticks.
That was the only difference.

34:57.475 --> 35:00.043
So, they must've opened the red
box when the lights went out.

35:00.044 --> 35:02.742
- And you didn't say anything to them?
- Would you?

35:02.743 --> 35:04.375
No, I wouldn't.

35:04.376 --> 35:06.976
I think I would've thought I was
going to die, or something.

35:06.977 --> 35:08.909
Okay, okay. So, that's it?

35:08.910 --> 35:11.842
Well, that and there's
this weird zone...

35:11.843 --> 35:13.608
that's even darker
than the rest of it all.

35:13.609 --> 35:16.010
We went through that.

35:16.011 --> 35:17.842
We went through that
when we went down there.

35:17.843 --> 35:20.209
We need to find out
what's going on.

35:20.210 --> 35:22.242
- The Internet's down. We don't have...
- We can't just sit here.

35:22.243 --> 35:25.043
What else? Do you guys have any...

35:25.044 --> 35:26.909
Do you have books?

35:26.910 --> 35:28.342
Books on what? Books on comets?

35:28.343 --> 35:29.976
Comets, gravity, black holes...

35:29.977 --> 35:32.941
Yeah, I've got Shakespeare, some
Henry Miller and some screenplays.

35:32.942 --> 35:34.642
Dude, I'm a fucking actor.

35:34.643 --> 35:36.942
Anything about quantum physics?

35:36.943 --> 35:39.508
Yeah, that's right up my alley.

35:39.509 --> 35:41.975
Some actors read.

35:41.976 --> 35:45.309
Your brother left a book
at our house and...

35:45.310 --> 35:46.941
What?

35:46.942 --> 35:48.575
I put it in an envelope to mail,

35:48.576 --> 35:50.243
but I-I put it in your car.

35:50.244 --> 35:52.275
- And it's about?
- I don't know what it's about.

35:52.276 --> 35:53.943
- Comets?
- It's just one of his books.

35:53.944 --> 35:55.708
It's always about stuff like that.

35:55.709 --> 35:58.542
Yeah, I will... I will go get
the book I don't know about.

35:58.543 --> 36:01.776
Can somebody go with him?
Could you bring the bat?

36:01.777 --> 36:04.076
- Yeah.
- Yes. That's a good idea.

36:04.077 --> 36:07.409
Please be careful, babe.

36:07.410 --> 36:09.142
Okay.

36:09.143 --> 36:10.975
Should we wake up Lee?

36:10.976 --> 36:15.043
How could she go to sleep
in the middle of all this?

36:15.710 --> 36:18.745
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, babe.

36:19.543 --> 36:21.508
Jesus.
Calm down, everybody.

36:21.509 --> 36:23.041
Oh, baby.

36:23.042 --> 36:25.983
I was gonna mail it back to him.

36:30.777 --> 36:32.375
What is it?

36:32.376 --> 36:36.075
"Gravitation: An Introduction
To Current Research."

36:36.076 --> 36:37.742
That's not gonna apply.

36:37.743 --> 36:40.708
So, is his brother like a
scientist, or something?

36:40.709 --> 36:42.209
He's just a really trippy guy.

36:42.210 --> 36:43.676
He's really, really smart,
a real egghead.

36:43.677 --> 36:47.242
But it's hard to... It's
like he thinks out loud.

36:47.243 --> 36:50.642
He's a teacher at U.C.S.D.
What do you got, Hugh?

36:50.643 --> 36:52.808
This is...

36:52.809 --> 36:56.842
These are Brian's notes from
his lesson plan for his class.

36:56.843 --> 37:00.476
"Decoherence and Schrödinger's
Cat." He talked about this.

37:00.477 --> 37:02.456
Do you guys know what
Schrödinger's cat is?

37:02.482 --> 37:04.009
I'm allergic.

37:04.010 --> 37:07.442
So, it's a, um...
It's a thought experiment.

37:07.443 --> 37:09.209
There's a...
There's a cat in a box...

37:09.210 --> 37:12.208
that has, like, a 50/50
chance of living...

37:12.209 --> 37:13.809
because there's a vial of poison...

37:13.810 --> 37:15.408
that's also in the box.

37:15.409 --> 37:18.974
So, regular physics would say
that it's one or the other.

37:18.975 --> 37:20.476
That the cat is
either alive or dead.

37:20.477 --> 37:23.308
But Brian would argue
that quantum physics says...

37:23.309 --> 37:26.274
that both realities
exist simultaneously.

37:26.275 --> 37:29.809
It's only when you open the
box that they collapse...

37:29.810 --> 37:31.909
into a single event.
Right?

37:31.910 --> 37:35.042
So, listen to this.
This is what he's written.

37:35.043 --> 37:36.742
"There is another theory:

37:36.743 --> 37:38.809
that two states
continue to exist...

37:38.810 --> 37:40.976
separate and decoherent
from each other,

37:40.977 --> 37:43.607
each creating a new
branch of reality...

37:43.608 --> 37:45.241
based on the two outcomes.

37:45.242 --> 37:48.274
Quantum decoherence ensures
that the different outcomes...

37:48.275 --> 37:51.076
have no interaction
with each other."

37:51.077 --> 37:53.341
- Hold on.
- Well, that explains it.

37:53.342 --> 37:58.008
So we're in the box.
We're the cat.

37:58.009 --> 38:00.809
We're both alive and dead.

38:00.810 --> 38:05.842
So, there are... There are two
separate realities, and...

38:05.843 --> 38:08.808
presumably until the comet passes.

38:08.809 --> 38:10.942
- Until the comet passes?
- Okay.

38:10.943 --> 38:14.842
Or decoherence is maintained and
those two separate realities...

38:14.843 --> 38:16.809
will remain separate
once the comet passes.

38:16.810 --> 38:18.309
Everybody will be fine.

38:18.310 --> 38:20.309
Decoherence keeps us separate.

38:20.310 --> 38:21.976
Right.

38:21.977 --> 38:25.742
Why are the other us contacting
us then in this way?

38:25.743 --> 38:27.275
They didn't want to.

38:27.276 --> 38:29.575
Who got the pictures?
Who... The numbers?

38:29.576 --> 38:33.177
We started it when we went
to find a house with lights.

38:33.178 --> 38:35.709
Yeah, maybe they didn't
mean the box for us.

38:35.710 --> 38:38.275
The box isn't for us.

38:38.276 --> 38:42.143
What if we've already
interacted with ourselves?

38:42.144 --> 38:44.876
So, we're collapsing on
ourselves right now.

38:44.877 --> 38:47.608
Not if we stay separate
from each other.

38:47.609 --> 38:49.909
It's already too late.
We've already been there.

38:49.910 --> 38:53.143
Do you remember that
movie Sliding Doors?

38:53.144 --> 38:56.242
Where just a fraction of a second...

38:56.243 --> 38:58.307
there could be two realities?

38:58.308 --> 39:01.275
In one, she runs and tries to get
on the subway and she can't.

39:01.276 --> 39:03.010
She gets her hand stuck in the door.

39:03.011 --> 39:04.674
In the other one, she gets
through and there's two...

39:04.675 --> 39:07.143
If we're collapsing right now,
I'm gonna collapse on them.

39:07.144 --> 39:08.875
I'm not gonna wait for
them to collapse on us.

39:08.876 --> 39:11.143
Whoa, whoa, Mike.

39:11.144 --> 39:13.108
I'll go over there and
I'll just kill 'em.

39:13.109 --> 39:15.841
- What?
- Half-kidding.

39:15.842 --> 39:17.308
- Mike, let's just...
- I love my fucking life.

39:17.309 --> 39:19.842
Let's be smart first before
we do anything stupid,

39:19.843 --> 39:21.342
and let's stick with
that we do know.

39:21.343 --> 39:24.241
And what's smart? Just
sitting here? Doing nothing?

39:24.242 --> 39:26.643
What we do know is that
we took this box. Right?

39:26.644 --> 39:29.140
So, our first act should
be to return it. Yes?

39:29.141 --> 39:31.108
Fuck that. No. We're not
returning that box.

39:31.109 --> 39:33.043
I don't trust that house.
That stays here.

39:33.044 --> 39:35.241
Wait, wait, wait.
What's got you so freaked out?

39:35.242 --> 39:37.975
- Stupid, stupid question.
- You're right.

39:37.976 --> 39:40.309
We're not at war with the
house down the street.

39:40.310 --> 39:43.541
They might literally be
the same people as us.

39:43.542 --> 39:45.474
Mike's saying come over
here and let's kill us.

39:45.475 --> 39:50.541
That's right. If you do it first,
you know who you're gonna fight?

39:50.542 --> 39:52.042
- Mike.
- You.

39:52.043 --> 39:54.745
You're gonna run into you.

39:55.543 --> 39:57.848
Who's gonna win that?

39:58.233 --> 40:00.810
Who did you see in the
window when you went there?

40:00.811 --> 40:02.709
- Did you see yourself?
- I did not see myself.

40:02.710 --> 40:04.274
- I told you who I saw.
- Okay, okay.

40:04.275 --> 40:08.942
But what if, in that over there,
that house, what if I'm drinking?

40:08.943 --> 40:12.193
I mean, just think
about that for a sec.

40:13.777 --> 40:15.808
That's a fucked-up Michael.

40:15.809 --> 40:18.009
Oh, God.

40:18.010 --> 40:19.808
I'm not gonna wait for a
fucking drunk Mike...

40:19.809 --> 40:21.307
to come over here and kill me.

40:21.308 --> 40:25.245
And kill you and kill
you and kill you.

40:27.043 --> 40:29.841
I'm not waiting for that.

40:29.842 --> 40:32.275
Wait, wait, wait a minute.

40:32.276 --> 40:34.208
Who did you see when you were there?

40:34.209 --> 40:39.742
I saw Amir, I saw Hugh,
and I saw Lee.

40:39.743 --> 40:41.608
Okay. Lee's not here right now.

40:41.609 --> 40:43.876
- She's taking a nap.
- What do you mean, she's taking a nap?

40:43.877 --> 40:46.808
- So, it's different, then.
- Something's off. It's not the same.

40:46.809 --> 40:48.308
In this reality, Lee's napping.

40:48.309 --> 40:51.107
Maybe in that reality,
you're napping?

40:51.108 --> 40:52.608
So, that's why Mike didn't see her.

40:52.609 --> 40:57.141
Right, and if Beth is
napping in that reality...

40:57.142 --> 40:58.776
they don't have the book.

40:58.777 --> 41:00.308
- They don't.
- Right.

41:00.309 --> 41:01.976
The other house doesn't
have the book.

41:01.977 --> 41:03.541
And if they don't have the book,

41:03.542 --> 41:07.307
they're not having this
conversation right now.

41:07.308 --> 41:10.041
So, then if we get the
book from the car...

41:10.042 --> 41:12.242
then we can avoid all this.

41:12.243 --> 41:16.820
- Take it? Take their book?
- It's a possibility.

41:16.821 --> 41:19.608
- Hugh, give me your keys.
- No, no, no. Wait, wait, wait.

41:19.609 --> 41:22.313
We're not supposed to
mess with any of this.

41:22.314 --> 41:23.909
Why would we even risk this?

41:23.910 --> 41:26.407
- He's talking about going over and fighting them.
- But why make it worse?

41:26.408 --> 41:28.708
Because then I don't have to
go over there and kill them.

41:28.709 --> 41:30.242
Just give me the keys.

41:30.243 --> 41:33.375
No. I don't think that
we should do anything.

41:33.376 --> 41:36.784
And you are not taking my keys.

41:42.577 --> 41:45.477
Where you going, Mike?

41:45.478 --> 41:50.575
How do we know it's exactly us?
What if it's just externals? What if...

41:50.576 --> 41:52.242
- The dark side of us.
- Yeah.

41:52.243 --> 41:55.675
It's us, you guys. You mean,
the not friendly versions?

41:55.676 --> 41:59.842
Well, if it's us, then this
could be... Is it a good thing?

41:59.843 --> 42:02.141
It sounds like it would
be a way to reach...

42:02.142 --> 42:03.841
higher consciousness,
if we want to...

42:03.842 --> 42:05.675
Like an acceptance of ourselves?

42:05.676 --> 42:08.742
Well, yeah. We always talk about meeting
ourselves and finding ourselves,

42:08.743 --> 42:10.208
and here we have an opportunity...

42:10.209 --> 42:12.809
to actually physically
find ourselves.

42:12.810 --> 42:14.341
That's a lot of pressure.

42:14.342 --> 42:17.108
- Look who's joined us.
- Hi, everybody.

42:17.109 --> 42:19.240
How are you, honey?
Okay.

42:19.241 --> 42:20.942
Welcome back to your
own dinner party.

42:20.943 --> 42:23.108
Yeah. How's my dinner party going?

42:23.109 --> 42:25.776
Super missed you.
It's going.

42:25.777 --> 42:27.274
I have an idea.

42:27.275 --> 42:29.341
I have an idea that
will prevent them...

42:29.342 --> 42:31.342
from getting the book from the car.

42:31.343 --> 42:33.208
What are you talking about, man?

42:33.209 --> 42:36.040
I'm gonna go to that house,
and I'm gonna blackmail myself.

42:36.041 --> 42:38.142
I'm gonna leave a
note to keep Mike...

42:38.143 --> 42:40.141
from having them go to
the car to get that book.

42:40.142 --> 42:42.007
What do you mean, a blackmail note?

42:42.008 --> 42:43.709
Something I know that
I don't want revealed.

42:43.710 --> 42:45.341
What are you talking about?

42:45.342 --> 42:46.909
The thing with Beth.

42:46.910 --> 42:48.575
The thing with Beth?

42:48.576 --> 42:50.908
I thought you and Hugh
worked that out years ago.

42:50.909 --> 42:53.141
This is the worst
idea I've ever heard.

42:53.142 --> 42:55.007
It's amazing, 'cause
it would work on me.

42:55.008 --> 42:57.309
- Going over there...
- It's the same person.

42:57.310 --> 42:58.974
We don't...
You don't know that.

42:58.975 --> 43:00.808
This will pass.
It's brilliant.

43:00.809 --> 43:02.541
- No. It is not brilliant.
- It's brilliant.

43:02.542 --> 43:05.308
Dude, no. I know this
look in your eye.

43:05.309 --> 43:07.509
Mike, no.

43:07.510 --> 43:09.408
Why would he even say that?

43:09.409 --> 43:12.407
Divergence. Otherwise,
it's just the same people.

43:12.476 --> 43:14.107
And if it's the same people,

43:14.108 --> 43:16.109
then why not just leave
each other alone?

43:16.110 --> 43:17.876
That's what I would want me to do.

43:17.877 --> 43:19.474
That might be the best thing to do.

43:19.475 --> 43:21.274
Right?
You doing okay?

43:21.275 --> 43:22.708
Yeah, yeah.

43:22.709 --> 43:26.908
I don't know if I'm woozy from
the drops or if it's like...

43:26.909 --> 43:28.742
- What drops?
- What drops?

43:28.743 --> 43:31.041
- Um...
- Did you give her...

43:31.042 --> 43:33.576
Yeah, well.
She wanted to take...

43:33.577 --> 43:36.442
I just felt so weird before.

43:36.443 --> 43:40.641
- It's this stuff I brought, this rescue remedy.
- What is it?

43:40.642 --> 43:45.276
It's got echinacea, golden seal,
passion flower and a little ketamine.

43:45.277 --> 43:47.842
I swear to God.

43:47.843 --> 43:49.542
- Ketamine?
- A little ketamine?

43:49.543 --> 43:52.107
- It's not like you're going to go into this...
- Beth.

43:52.108 --> 43:56.007
- What?
- I'm so sorry if I'm wrong here...

43:56.008 --> 43:59.142
and I'm saying something
incredibly inappropriate.

43:59.143 --> 44:01.940
What?

44:01.941 --> 44:05.442
Did you put any of that in the food?

44:05.443 --> 44:07.741
Yes. That would explain a lot.
Lee asked me for some.

44:07.742 --> 44:09.375
Oh, come on, Amir.

44:09.376 --> 44:10.841
Are you serious?

44:10.842 --> 44:13.374
I had to ask.

44:13.375 --> 44:16.007
She asked to take some
and I gave her some.

44:16.008 --> 44:18.308
When we did the mushrooms years ago,

44:18.309 --> 44:22.641
we talked about it, and I put
them in the spaghetti sauce.

44:22.642 --> 44:24.175
That was a group decision.

44:24.176 --> 44:26.242
I know we agreed,
but I had to ask because...

44:26.243 --> 44:29.586
You think that I would just
put drugs in your food?

44:29.587 --> 44:30.341
Oh, my God.

44:30.342 --> 44:32.209
Okay. I'll show you.

44:32.210 --> 44:34.274
On top of all this,
you think I'd drug you?

44:34.275 --> 44:36.874
I'll show you. Let's just
see how much is in there.

44:36.875 --> 44:39.642
This is the vial I brought.

44:39.643 --> 44:41.142
Yeah, and a quarter of it is gone.

44:41.143 --> 44:43.743
But that's... She's had a
couple of drops out of it.

44:43.744 --> 44:46.840
- That's it.
- This is, like, high-grade pharmaceutical...

44:46.841 --> 44:48.907
It is watered down.
You can't.

44:48.908 --> 44:50.374
You opened it up and
watered it down?

44:50.375 --> 44:52.107
Okay, but if you took enough of it,

44:52.108 --> 44:53.841
isn't it true that you
would have hallucinations?

44:53.842 --> 44:55.341
You would have to
have a massive dose.

44:55.342 --> 44:57.175
You would have to take
the entire bottle.

44:57.176 --> 44:59.744
Okay. Fine.
But is it true?

45:00.410 --> 45:02.242
Yes. Okay. And is it also true...

45:02.243 --> 45:04.575
that one of the other
effects can be paranoia?

45:04.576 --> 45:07.308
Yes, but you...

45:07.309 --> 45:08.974
Again, you would have to have all of it.

45:08.975 --> 45:11.141
The whole bottle. The whole bottle.
And it would never...

45:11.142 --> 45:14.409
Even if all of us
took a bottle each,

45:14.410 --> 45:16.741
it would never create
a mass hallucination.

45:16.742 --> 45:20.407
- I'm not a criminal.
- It would be a nice conclusion right now.

45:20.408 --> 45:22.508
Wouldn't this be great if
we were hallucinating?

45:22.509 --> 45:25.174
- Well, it's not the explanation.
- Fine.

45:25.175 --> 45:28.874
- I believe you.
- This is the bottle.

45:28.875 --> 45:31.008
- She asked for it. I gave her some.
- Okay.

45:31.009 --> 45:33.142
I-I did not drug your food.

45:33.143 --> 45:35.207
- I did not drug your food.
- I...

45:35.208 --> 45:37.907
- Get it?
- Lay off, okay?

45:37.908 --> 45:40.608
I swear to God.

45:40.609 --> 45:42.807
Thanks.

45:45.510 --> 45:48.008
Hey, where'd you get this?
This is so cute.

45:48.009 --> 45:50.174
Oh, I got it at, Galaxy.
That thrift store.

45:50.175 --> 45:51.875
Oh, I love that place.

45:51.876 --> 45:53.775
- That's great.
- They have such cute stuff.

45:53.776 --> 45:56.375
I just...
I need a drink.

45:56.376 --> 45:57.807
Yeah.

45:57.808 --> 46:00.875
Okay.

46:00.876 --> 46:05.842
I just want to wake up and
start again, you know?

46:19.342 --> 46:22.508
Blue.

46:22.509 --> 46:24.075
It's not even cracked.

46:24.076 --> 46:26.274
What are we gonna do?

46:26.275 --> 46:28.442
We have to get the fuck out of here.

46:28.443 --> 46:30.174
Okay.

46:30.175 --> 46:31.942
- Okay. Let's take...
- Take the book.

46:31.943 --> 46:33.441
- Take the book.
- Do we take the box?

46:33.442 --> 46:36.707
- Take the box. This is what they...
- Take it.

46:36.708 --> 46:40.575
Hey. You okay?

46:40.576 --> 46:43.041
Where'd you go?

46:43.042 --> 46:44.840
I need a drink.

46:44.841 --> 46:48.840
Hey. What...
Where'd you go?

46:48.841 --> 46:50.542
I went to the house, dude.

46:50.543 --> 46:53.108
- I told you.
- What happened?

46:53.109 --> 46:55.142
I just dropped the letter off.

46:55.143 --> 46:59.408
I saw the book.

46:59.409 --> 47:03.007
I was gonna... I was gonna
smash the window...

47:03.008 --> 47:04.542
and take the book.

47:04.543 --> 47:07.108
I didn't do that, though.
I did not do that.

47:07.109 --> 47:10.576
I just dropped off the
letter, and, um...

47:10.577 --> 47:15.673
then I was gonna wait,
to see their reaction.

47:15.674 --> 47:17.542
But I fuckin' freaked out.

47:17.543 --> 47:19.475
- You've been gone, like, five minutes.
- Like 45 minutes, dude.

47:19.476 --> 47:21.141
- No. No. You talked to me.
- Bullshit.

47:21.142 --> 47:22.842
You went in the kitchen.

47:22.843 --> 47:26.142
You've been gone for
five, maybe 10 tops.

47:26.143 --> 47:29.511
You're fuckin' crazy.

47:30.309 --> 47:35.119
Oh, Mike.
Mike, don't do that.

47:43.909 --> 47:45.940
- Oh, my God.
- Mike, what was...

47:45.941 --> 47:47.741
Don't do this.

47:47.742 --> 47:50.740
Mike, please?
Why now?

47:50.741 --> 47:54.479
Why not now, honey?
Why not now?

47:55.118 --> 47:57.642
- Where are Hugh and...
- We were in the kitchen.

47:57.643 --> 47:59.675
Where's...

47:59.676 --> 48:02.675
- Where's Hugh?
- Where's Amir?

48:02.676 --> 48:05.242
More importantly, where's the box?

48:05.243 --> 48:07.041
Oh, my God.
They took the box.

48:07.042 --> 48:08.707
Mike, where did they go?

48:08.708 --> 48:11.608
I have no clue where they went.
You gotta be kidding.

48:11.609 --> 48:13.241
You were in here.
What happened?

48:13.242 --> 48:16.842
Where's the book?
Where's the book?

48:16.843 --> 48:19.509
Why would they bring
that to the other house?

48:19.510 --> 48:23.208
They said they wanted to take it back
so they could make everything right.

48:23.209 --> 48:25.908
They wanted to return it, so everything
would be fine from the beginning, but...

48:25.909 --> 48:29.075
Why would they bring the book? It's
the one thing that we wouldn't...

48:29.076 --> 48:32.940
- They took everything we have.
- Wait a minute.

48:32.941 --> 48:34.508
We have to go get them.

48:34.509 --> 48:36.875
Wait a minute. They were the
first ones to leave, right?

48:36.876 --> 48:39.707
And then they... They came back.
They said they saw something.

48:39.708 --> 48:41.307
They've been acting
weird ever since.

48:41.308 --> 48:46.375
What are you implying?
Oh, my God.

48:46.376 --> 48:49.075
- No, that's... Well, you guys left, too.
- Think about it.

48:49.076 --> 48:50.808
I mean, everyone...
You left, too.

48:50.809 --> 48:52.541
Amir came back and got
so quiet, Come on.

48:52.542 --> 48:54.309
And then...
and he didn't...

48:54.310 --> 48:56.274
- Amir was being totally weird.
- I'll bring 'em back.

48:56.275 --> 48:58.142
- I'll see what's going on.
- Baby, you're not...

48:58.143 --> 48:59.741
- You're not going anywhere.
- I'll be back.

48:59.742 --> 49:01.707
I'm just gonna go
bring them back...

49:01.708 --> 49:03.175
and find out what
the hell's going on.

49:03.176 --> 49:05.207
- No. You're not leaving.
- Baby, relax. What?

49:05.208 --> 49:06.841
- No.
- It's fine. I'll be back.

49:06.842 --> 49:11.542
I'm not gonna let you go.

49:11.543 --> 49:15.249
It would be fucking crazy.

49:20.043 --> 49:21.819
Okay. So, what are we gonna do?

49:21.820 --> 49:25.175
I mean, they're out there, and I swear
to God, I'm gonna have a heart attack.

49:25.176 --> 49:27.008
- We've gotta do something.
- Let's have a drink.

49:27.009 --> 49:28.774
We don't even know if that was them.

49:28.775 --> 49:30.607
Would you quit saying that, please?

49:30.608 --> 49:32.741
No, but if it wasn't them,
then Mike is right,

49:32.742 --> 49:34.274
and we can't trust the other house.

49:34.275 --> 49:35.975
- We can't trust ourselves.
- That's right.

49:35.976 --> 49:40.779
- Jesus.
- And our clues just left the house.

49:42.576 --> 49:45.574
No. Wait.

49:45.575 --> 49:49.207
The clues are still here.

49:49.208 --> 49:51.708
If they had the pictures, then...

49:51.709 --> 49:54.142
Mike, you took that picture
of me and Kevin. Right?

49:54.143 --> 49:57.108
Do you have it here?

49:57.109 --> 50:00.241
I-I can't take this anymore.
I can't take it.

50:00.242 --> 50:04.018
- Sweetheart...
- Can you at least go look for it?

50:05.109 --> 50:08.858
I'm gonna look for
another bottle of wine.

50:24.641 --> 50:27.604
This is so stupid.

50:27.605 --> 50:29.341
Should I be keeping an eye on him?

50:29.342 --> 50:32.540
I feel like I don't
want to hover, and...

50:32.541 --> 50:36.810
I don't know.

50:37.608 --> 50:40.877
Just give it a minute, and then...

50:41.675 --> 50:44.505
go in and talk to him, I guess.

50:46.075 --> 50:49.608
I don't know who Mike is anymore.
Not when he drinks.

50:49.609 --> 50:52.309
Everything that's gone wrong with us
started when he started drinking.

50:52.310 --> 50:54.075
It's why we had to leave L.A.

50:54.076 --> 50:55.975
It's why he doesn't have a career.

50:55.976 --> 50:58.575
He's just...
I don't know.

50:58.576 --> 51:01.633
Not the man I married.

52:02.309 --> 52:03.974
Hey.

52:03.975 --> 52:06.075
- Hey.
- How you doing?

52:06.076 --> 52:08.674
How you holding up?

52:08.675 --> 52:10.974
All things considered, all right.

52:10.975 --> 52:13.373
I totally don't believe you.

52:13.374 --> 52:15.408
Yeah. Well, am I being
some... What's going on?

52:15.409 --> 52:17.209
I... Amir told me you were
gonna go to Vietnam...

52:17.210 --> 52:18.807
and Em's not going with you?

52:18.808 --> 52:20.807
Yeah. I...

52:20.808 --> 52:22.707
I gotta go for work
for, I don't know...

52:22.708 --> 52:24.942
It's four months, I think, and,

52:24.943 --> 52:26.975
yeah, I want her to
come along, but...

52:26.976 --> 52:28.474
She'd be crazy not to go with you.

52:28.475 --> 52:30.675
Yeah. That's what I think.

52:30.676 --> 52:32.374
Yeah. I don't...
I don't know.

52:32.375 --> 52:34.508
I mean, it's... I-I really
don't want to interfere.

52:34.509 --> 52:36.174
It doesn't seem like
any of my business,

52:36.175 --> 52:38.841
but I think you've
always been someone...

52:38.842 --> 52:42.275
who's extremely passionate about
your life and what you're doing,

52:42.276 --> 52:45.208
and if you have a partner that
seems to hesitate all the time,

52:45.209 --> 52:49.475
with things of life, I don't know
if that's gonna make you happy.

52:49.476 --> 52:51.941
Oh. She's...

52:51.942 --> 52:54.675
I mean, I love her, and...
It's just who she is.

52:54.676 --> 52:58.641
- Sometimes she's a little...
- Tall?

53:00.243 --> 53:02.339
- Crazy.
- She's a little bit tall.

53:02.340 --> 53:04.674
I mean, do you have to stand
on your tiptoes to kiss her?

53:04.675 --> 53:07.873
I...

53:10.575 --> 53:12.807
Sometimes people just fit well.

53:12.808 --> 53:15.875
Laurie...
Like that Sharks game?

53:15.876 --> 53:19.040
Come on, you can't tell
me we don't fit well.

53:19.041 --> 53:21.740
I had to do yoga for a week
afterwards to recover.

53:21.741 --> 53:24.741
I do remember that.

53:24.742 --> 53:29.778
I just think that maybe...

53:32.574 --> 53:34.508
Laurie.

53:34.509 --> 53:37.527
I'm sorry. I'm crossing all
kinds of boundaries with you.

53:37.528 --> 53:39.582
Yeah.

53:48.841 --> 53:51.975
Baby?
Hi.

53:51.976 --> 53:55.407
You know, I think you're right...

53:55.408 --> 53:58.911
that everything
happens for a reason.

54:05.175 --> 54:08.374
Should I get the bat?

54:08.375 --> 54:10.642
For you or for me?

54:10.643 --> 54:13.245
Could be either.

54:15.042 --> 54:17.440
What are we doing here?

54:17.441 --> 54:23.520
If I'm losing it over
there, I'm losing it here.

54:23.521 --> 54:25.941
It doesn't have to be like that.
Sure, it does.

54:25.942 --> 54:28.008
It's the same thing.

54:28.009 --> 54:30.508
No, it's not.

54:30.509 --> 54:33.241
How do you figure?

54:33.242 --> 54:38.041
Because there's no way that anybody
over there, or... or anywhere,

54:38.042 --> 54:43.015
loves you as much as I
love you right here.

54:47.809 --> 54:52.551
I fucked up.

55:00.342 --> 55:02.907
Hi.
Hey.

55:02.908 --> 55:06.742
How you doing?

55:06.743 --> 55:11.407
Fine.

55:11.408 --> 55:14.108
Is... Is everything okay?

55:14.109 --> 55:18.341
Is there something going on?

55:18.342 --> 55:22.641
Beth just walked up to me and...

55:22.642 --> 55:27.041
she didn't really say much,
but she said that she...

55:27.042 --> 55:31.232
saw you and Laurie talk
in the hallway, and...

55:31.233 --> 55:33.075
Jesus Christ, Em.
I think we have...

55:33.076 --> 55:35.040
some more important things
to worry about right now...

55:35.041 --> 55:38.546
than what Beth is saying.

55:41.342 --> 55:43.573
Jesus Christ.

55:43.574 --> 55:45.908
Are you kidding me? That
would be the generator.

55:45.909 --> 55:48.441
- Hold on.
- All right. You know what to do.

55:48.442 --> 55:50.508
- We have thousands of matches at home.
- Don't burn yourself.

55:50.509 --> 55:52.841
- Kevin, do you have matches?
- Yeah, I got some.

55:52.842 --> 55:55.008
Here.

55:55.009 --> 55:56.641
- Hold it.
- I don't know...

55:56.642 --> 55:58.975
- You want to put this on the table?
- Yeah. Yeah.

55:58.976 --> 56:01.173
That was right out front.

56:01.174 --> 56:03.341
- Are you kidding?
- That sounds like one of our cars.

56:03.342 --> 56:05.074
Like one of our cars
getting broken into.

56:05.075 --> 56:06.740
Look, I'm going out there.
I can't stand this.

56:06.741 --> 56:09.174
- I'm gonna go see what's going on.
- Not without the rest of us.

56:09.175 --> 56:12.074
- Let's just all go.
- Fine. Then let's all go, but I'm going.

56:12.075 --> 56:13.807
- I'll get my coat.
- I don't think we should.

56:13.808 --> 56:15.474
- Let's get a flashlight.
- We'll be fine.

56:15.475 --> 56:17.541
- Here. I got one here.
- You guys lead, okay?

56:17.542 --> 56:19.074
- You ready?
- Okay. Here we go.

56:19.075 --> 56:20.875
- Stay close. Stay close.
- Here we go.

56:20.876 --> 56:24.779
- Where did it come from?
- I don't know.

56:28.574 --> 56:30.773
That's it, right?

56:32.476 --> 56:36.306
Oh, my God.
Jesus. Look.

56:36.307 --> 56:40.241
- Is there anything in there?
- I don't see anything.

56:40.242 --> 56:42.874
Oh, my God.
Should we...

56:42.875 --> 56:44.974
- Should we check our cars?
- That's crazy.

56:44.975 --> 56:46.541
Yeah, why doesn't everybody
check their own car.

56:46.542 --> 56:48.675
- See if we find anything else.
- Let's look at our cars.

56:48.676 --> 56:50.973
- Okay.
- All right. After you.

56:50.974 --> 56:54.308
Is everyone nearby?

56:54.309 --> 56:58.575
We shouldn't spread out too much.

57:15.041 --> 57:17.506
- Hey.
- Everything okay?

57:17.507 --> 57:21.073
Yeah. I just...

57:21.074 --> 57:26.007
put this ring on that
you got me at the fair.

57:26.008 --> 57:28.374
Remember?
I know it's...

57:28.375 --> 57:31.208
I know it's cheesy, but I
just wanted to have it on.

57:31.209 --> 57:33.273
Cheeseball.

57:33.274 --> 57:37.540
- It was a good day.
- It was a good day.

57:37.541 --> 57:39.908
Are we okay?

57:39.909 --> 57:43.875
- Yeah, babe.
- After that whole Laurie thing?

57:43.876 --> 57:46.040
Yeah.

57:46.041 --> 57:47.842
I don't know what the
hell she's thinking,

57:47.843 --> 57:50.875
but yeah, we're good.

57:50.876 --> 57:54.948
Come here. Hey.

57:58.743 --> 58:01.274
Is everything okay with Hugh's car?

58:01.275 --> 58:06.140
- What do you mean?
- Well, did they take anything?

58:06.141 --> 58:10.237
You just checked on his car.
Did they take anything?

58:38.008 --> 58:40.173
Doesn't make any sense at all.

58:40.174 --> 58:42.707
Do you think it's just someone
trying to intimidate us?

58:42.708 --> 58:44.240
Intimidate? No.
I... It's...

58:44.241 --> 58:46.573
None of this...
It doesn't...

58:46.574 --> 58:49.807
I mean, it's like they're
looking for something, and...

58:49.808 --> 58:53.041
- But there's nothing in there.
- Exactly. There's nothing in there. So, why...

58:53.042 --> 58:54.507
They could see that
there's nothing in there.

58:54.508 --> 58:56.474
- We could see that there's nothing in there.
- I know.

58:56.475 --> 58:59.074
Why break the window
if there's nothing there?

58:59.075 --> 59:02.475
- That doesn't make any sense.
- None of this makes any sense.

59:02.476 --> 59:04.006
Where were you?

59:04.007 --> 59:07.441
I went and got this ring.

59:07.442 --> 59:11.605
Nice.

59:11.606 --> 59:13.341
All right, hold on.
Let's-Let's...

59:13.342 --> 59:16.340
Let's just try and figure out...

59:16.341 --> 59:22.307
why we would break into
a car... Hugh's car...

59:22.308 --> 59:24.575
knowing that the book wasn't there.

59:24.576 --> 59:26.540
Well, we're assuming that
the book is the motive.

59:26.541 --> 59:29.441
What if the motive is
completely different?

59:29.442 --> 59:31.374
- Did you hear something?
- What the hell is that?

59:31.375 --> 59:33.140
It's outside. No, Mike,
Mike, Mike, Mike.

59:33.141 --> 59:36.708
- Oh, shit! There's someone coming.
- What?

59:36.709 --> 59:38.742
They're coming over here, guys.

59:38.743 --> 59:40.640
Yeah. It's Hugh.

59:40.641 --> 59:42.441
- Is it Hugh?
- Is it Hugh and Amir?

59:42.442 --> 59:45.141
Yeah, it's blue.
It's Hugh and Amir. Cool.

59:45.142 --> 59:47.675
- They're coming to the door.
- Are you sure?

59:47.676 --> 59:50.906
- It looks like it.
- Oh, baby.

59:50.907 --> 59:52.641
Are you all okay?

59:52.642 --> 59:56.074
Hey, where have you been?
What happened? Okay.

59:56.075 --> 59:59.340
What have you been... Why did
you take... What did you do?

59:59.341 --> 01:00:02.374
- Can you please tell us what happened?
- We went to...

01:00:02.375 --> 01:00:05.340
We went to make a phone
call, and then when...

01:00:05.341 --> 01:00:07.307
when we looked in
the door, we saw...

01:00:07.308 --> 01:00:11.540
We saw this, basically.
I, I got startled.

01:00:11.541 --> 01:00:14.206
I fell over. I hit my head.
We went back to the house to...

01:00:14.207 --> 01:00:16.307
Wait. You already
came back here.

01:00:16.308 --> 01:00:18.108
We already heard this story.

01:00:18.109 --> 01:00:19.941
Why are you telling
us this story again?

01:00:19.942 --> 01:00:21.541
- You came back with the box.
- Wait. What?

01:00:21.542 --> 01:00:23.641
Because you came back,
and after you hit your head...

01:00:23.642 --> 01:00:26.992
We gave him a Band-Aid
and you gave us the...

01:00:26.993 --> 01:00:28.641
But not that Band-Aid.

01:00:28.642 --> 01:00:32.407
- What do you mean?
- Oh, my God. I gave you a cloth Band-Aid.

01:00:32.408 --> 01:00:35.774
Wait a minute. Hugh... There
was a Hugh and an Amir here?

01:00:35.775 --> 01:00:37.641
Yes. And you left with the book.

01:00:37.642 --> 01:00:40.406
You left with the pictures, and
we didn't know where you went.

01:00:40.407 --> 01:00:42.940
We were at a house where
everybody had red glowsticks.

01:00:42.941 --> 01:00:45.541
- You had red glowsticks.
- Do you understand?

01:00:45.542 --> 01:00:49.540
We... We have red glow... We
took them from the other house.

01:00:49.541 --> 01:00:51.640
- Right.
- Look. Look.

01:00:51.641 --> 01:00:54.906
Is that... Look. That box of
red glowsticks is unopened.

01:00:54.907 --> 01:00:58.006
Guys, if they started
here, they belong here.

01:00:58.007 --> 01:01:00.241
They're in the right house.

01:01:00.242 --> 01:01:03.074
- Well, welcome back.
- Welcome back.

01:01:03.075 --> 01:01:05.707
- Jeez, man, I'm sorry.
- That's all right.

01:01:05.708 --> 01:01:07.740
Sorry.

01:01:07.741 --> 01:01:11.974
So, guys, what was the other
Mike like? What was he doing?

01:01:11.975 --> 01:01:16.576
The other Mike is...
He's worried about you.

01:01:17.303 --> 01:01:19.407
So, it was you guys
who left us the note.

01:01:19.408 --> 01:01:23.041
No, I never got out with that note.

01:01:23.042 --> 01:01:24.872
We ended up with two notes.

01:01:24.873 --> 01:01:26.906
And so did we.

01:01:26.907 --> 01:01:28.741
Well, where's... We have two notes.

01:01:28.742 --> 01:01:33.107
One that was written here and
one that was left on the door.

01:01:33.108 --> 01:01:36.408
If you didn't, and if
the other Hugh didn't,

01:01:36.409 --> 01:01:39.606
then who has been
leaving the notes?

01:01:39.607 --> 01:01:42.907
"Quantum decoherence ensures
that the different outcomes...

01:01:42.908 --> 01:01:45.240
have no interaction
with one another."

01:01:45.241 --> 01:01:47.840
So, that one note has been
written at least four times.

01:01:47.841 --> 01:01:52.091
Well, how many Hugh and Amirs
are walking around out there?

01:01:53.709 --> 01:01:55.241
Okay, before we do anything,

01:01:55.242 --> 01:01:58.274
we have to figure out how
to mark our own house.

01:01:58.275 --> 01:02:00.807
Just stay inside. No, no.
She's right.

01:02:00.808 --> 01:02:03.307
Staying inside isn't realistic.

01:02:03.308 --> 01:02:06.308
We need some kind of marker.
We got to mark this house.

01:02:06.309 --> 01:02:08.007
If every house is the same...

01:02:08.008 --> 01:02:10.141
If we put a marker in
front of the house,

01:02:10.142 --> 01:02:12.173
there could be an infinite
number of houses with that mark.

01:02:12.174 --> 01:02:14.006
So, we have to do something random.

01:02:14.007 --> 01:02:15.474
Something that can't be repeated.
Something unique.

01:02:15.475 --> 01:02:17.839
Dice. Do we have dice?
We have dice?

01:02:17.840 --> 01:02:21.841
- Um, Yahtzee.
- Yeah, Yahtzee.

01:02:21.842 --> 01:02:25.940
If we each roll a number for each
of us, that's what? That's...

01:02:25.941 --> 01:02:28.940
Six times six times six times six
times... That's hugely random.

01:02:28.941 --> 01:02:32.742
- The probability of that repeating is... tiny.
- And then what? We...

01:02:32.743 --> 01:02:35.241
But so we have to have
something visual.

01:02:35.242 --> 01:02:37.419
I mean, should we write
it down, put it in...

01:02:37.420 --> 01:02:39.173
put it outside? Put it in an envelope?

01:02:39.174 --> 01:02:40.807
We still won't know.
No, no, no, no.

01:02:40.808 --> 01:02:42.473
We need something to mark it.

01:02:42.474 --> 01:02:45.674
Yeah. We put it in a box.

01:02:45.675 --> 01:02:47.740
- That's, that's...
- That's exactly what they've done.

01:02:47.741 --> 01:02:50.407
- They were ahead of us.
- They were making a marker for their house.

01:02:50.408 --> 01:02:52.806
They made a unique mark.
Only we took it.

01:02:52.807 --> 01:02:54.773
If it seems like a good idea to us,

01:02:54.774 --> 01:02:56.274
it would seem like a
good idea to them.

01:02:56.275 --> 01:02:59.541
- Do you have a box?
- Yeah. Yeah, let me look.

01:02:59.542 --> 01:03:01.374
So, we need photos.

01:03:01.375 --> 01:03:04.308
This is so crazy.
It's par for the night.

01:03:04.309 --> 01:03:06.641
- There are a lot of pictures here.
- You can't use that picture.

01:03:06.642 --> 01:03:08.641
That's ridiculous.

01:03:08.642 --> 01:03:11.907
- I'm the attorney for Grizzly Adams.
- Yeah, I know. This is...

01:03:11.908 --> 01:03:13.740
I'm never hiring you.

01:03:13.741 --> 01:03:16.740
How does this work as a box?

01:03:16.741 --> 01:03:18.440
I didn't even know we had it.

01:03:18.441 --> 01:03:20.974
It was just under a pile
of crap in the back.

01:03:20.975 --> 01:03:22.772
If you can...
That'll work.

01:03:22.773 --> 01:03:25.006
So, tha... Tha... That's your box?

01:03:25.007 --> 01:03:28.139
- It was here all the time.
- Of course it was.

01:03:28.140 --> 01:03:31.674
I'm not too happy about
cutting these pictures.

01:03:31.675 --> 01:03:34.207
And we only have pictures of
you and I together, babe.

01:03:34.208 --> 01:03:37.774
I actually... I actually
have a photo of Kevin.

01:03:37.775 --> 01:03:39.739
- I know that's strange. Um...
- What?

01:03:39.740 --> 01:03:42.740
No, I have my, um...

01:03:42.741 --> 01:03:46.208
My checking account number is written on
the back of this old photo that I have,

01:03:46.209 --> 01:03:48.474
and it's just been in
my wallet forever.

01:03:48.475 --> 01:03:50.140
It's right here.

01:03:50.141 --> 01:03:52.773
What? You know what?
I-I'll just...

01:03:52.774 --> 01:03:55.906
- I'll cut this picture that we have here.
- Just use this one. It's okay.

01:03:55.907 --> 01:03:59.307
Just scratch off the number. Cut.

01:03:59.308 --> 01:04:01.608
Great. I think we got one of
everybody except me, so...

01:04:01.609 --> 01:04:05.007
I'm glad you guys all keep a lot
of pictures of your friend, Amir.

01:04:05.008 --> 01:04:08.839
Well, we'll take one of you.

01:04:08.840 --> 01:04:12.007
Smile, dickhead.

01:04:13.040 --> 01:04:14.706
Let me see.

01:04:14.707 --> 01:04:16.241
It's not exactly the same.

01:04:16.242 --> 01:04:19.106
It's not the same as the
one from the other box.

01:04:19.107 --> 01:04:22.741
They took a picture of me in the other
house, but it's not exactly the same.

01:04:22.742 --> 01:04:26.041
This is what we're talking about.
That's a moment where it can be...

01:04:26.042 --> 01:04:27.574
a different...
a divergent moment.

01:04:27.575 --> 01:04:29.906
That's what we're gonna do
right now with these dice.

01:04:29.907 --> 01:04:31.774
Wait. Since we're the blue house,

01:04:31.775 --> 01:04:33.307
shouldn't we use a blue pen?

01:04:33.308 --> 01:04:35.141
- Just to make it even more...
- That makes sense.

01:04:35.142 --> 01:04:37.307
Yeah?
The odds go up by three.

01:04:37.308 --> 01:04:39.608
So, does everyone have a die?

01:04:39.609 --> 01:04:41.241
- What's yours?
- Beth?

01:04:41.242 --> 01:04:43.406
All right.

01:04:43.407 --> 01:04:46.508
Six.

01:04:46.509 --> 01:04:48.773
Hugh?
Three.

01:04:48.774 --> 01:04:51.039
Mike?
Four.

01:04:51.040 --> 01:04:53.007
Six.

01:04:53.008 --> 01:04:56.107
Two.

01:04:56.108 --> 01:04:58.407
You guys know what a quick code is?
You know when you...

01:04:58.408 --> 01:05:00.474
are going online, going
into your bank account,

01:05:00.475 --> 01:05:02.507
and when you go to your
password, it'll give you...

01:05:02.508 --> 01:05:04.508
a picture to choose?

01:05:04.509 --> 01:05:08.408
That's your quick code. That's called an
MFA. It's a multi-factor authenticator.

01:05:08.409 --> 01:05:10.940
We do 'em. We put 'em in
whenever we build our big sites.

01:05:10.941 --> 01:05:12.706
It's an icon, right?

01:05:12.707 --> 01:05:15.840
- Sort of a random...
- A random object.

01:05:15.841 --> 01:05:17.639
Yeah. So, what if
each of these...

01:05:17.640 --> 01:05:21.174
has a random object in it to sort
of serve as that quick code, right?

01:05:21.175 --> 01:05:23.440
Right. Right. So, we pick
something to put in there.

01:05:23.441 --> 01:05:27.007
You could put anything in there, right?
A candle or a book or, um...

01:05:27.008 --> 01:05:29.740
- The oven mitt.
- Or a ping-pong paddle.

01:05:29.741 --> 01:05:32.473
Or a ping-pong paddle.
Exactly. Yeah.

01:05:32.474 --> 01:05:36.040
Exactly.

01:05:36.041 --> 01:05:38.906
- Well, how's this? And this is random, right?
- A coaster?

01:05:38.907 --> 01:05:40.973
Is anything really random tonight?

01:05:40.974 --> 01:05:42.674
If you have to leave,

01:05:42.675 --> 01:05:44.173
when you check the box, open it up,

01:05:44.174 --> 01:05:46.173
you see that, you know
you're off to a good start.

01:05:46.174 --> 01:05:47.941
I feel better.

01:05:47.942 --> 01:05:49.573
Okay.
So we've got the box.

01:05:49.574 --> 01:05:52.007
Yeah, and it only took all
night to figure it out.

01:05:52.008 --> 01:05:53.607
We've marked the house.
If we stay together,

01:05:53.608 --> 01:05:57.907
keep our heads up, and nobody
wanders off, we can get through this.

01:05:57.908 --> 01:05:59.539
- Thanks, coach.
- Yeah.

01:05:59.540 --> 01:06:02.574
- You want something?
- Yeah, water. Water would be great.

01:06:02.575 --> 01:06:04.739
I'm gonna get a drink.

01:06:04.740 --> 01:06:08.773
I wonder how different those
numbers are from the first box?

01:06:08.774 --> 01:06:10.706
Let me check.

01:06:10.707 --> 01:06:12.972
Where's my calculator?

01:06:12.973 --> 01:06:18.074
Let's see.
So, if there's eight of us...

01:06:18.075 --> 01:06:22.175
and it's six times six...

01:06:22.176 --> 01:06:24.540
times six.

01:06:24.541 --> 01:06:30.174
Three different colored
glowsticks times three...

01:06:30.175 --> 01:06:35.940
is 5,038,848 possible variables.

01:06:35.941 --> 01:06:39.980
So, that's the variable.

01:06:45.773 --> 01:06:49.970
Are you okay?

01:06:57.376 --> 01:06:59.440
Everything okay with the numbers?

01:06:59.441 --> 01:07:01.373
Yeah.

01:07:01.374 --> 01:07:06.006
D-Do you remember what number was
written on the back of your picture?

01:07:06.007 --> 01:07:08.241
- Five.
- Yeah?

01:07:08.242 --> 01:07:12.375
I found a good spot out front, just as long
as another Hugh and Amir don't come by.

01:07:12.376 --> 01:07:14.906
Kevin, do you remember what number
was written on the back of your picture?

01:07:14.907 --> 01:07:18.573
- Six.
- Yeah?

01:07:18.574 --> 01:07:21.907
- Beth?
- Three.

01:07:21.908 --> 01:07:23.607
Hugh, do you remember?

01:07:23.608 --> 01:07:25.772
- I was a three.
- You sure?

01:07:25.773 --> 01:07:29.706
Yeah. What's going
on in the kitchen?

01:07:29.707 --> 01:07:31.940
- Pound cake.
- Pound cake.

01:07:31.941 --> 01:07:34.640
The girls are breaking
out dessert...

01:07:34.641 --> 01:07:38.413
before the other house eats it.

01:07:41.209 --> 01:07:44.459
Hey, Mike, I need to
show you something.

01:07:46.774 --> 01:07:49.340
The numbers that I remember...

01:07:49.341 --> 01:07:52.774
from the box that was brought
here from the other house...

01:07:52.775 --> 01:07:56.343
are these numbers.

01:07:57.141 --> 01:08:00.474
But these are the numbers
that I found here...

01:08:00.475 --> 01:08:03.539
in this notepad.

01:08:03.540 --> 01:08:07.107
And I just asked everyone if
they can remember their number.

01:08:07.108 --> 01:08:10.308
Beth and Lee are from
this house originally,

01:08:10.309 --> 01:08:13.873
because they have never left.

01:08:13.874 --> 01:08:18.307
But the rest of us...
We are not from this house.

01:08:18.308 --> 01:08:20.807
We are visitors.

01:08:20.808 --> 01:08:24.510
Which means that this
Lee is not your wife.

01:08:25.309 --> 01:08:29.505
Are you with me?

01:08:31.874 --> 01:08:34.807
Well, there's more.

01:08:34.808 --> 01:08:38.140
Because Hugh and Amir...

01:08:38.140 --> 01:08:40.471
are from a third house.

01:08:40.473 --> 01:08:45.142
He just showed me his phone.
It's not cracked.

01:08:45.939 --> 01:08:48.973
Remember that dark area
that we walked through?

01:08:48.974 --> 01:08:51.372
I have a feeling that whoever
walks through that...

01:08:51.374 --> 01:08:55.006
is like they end up in the
middle of a roulette wheel,

01:08:55.006 --> 01:08:58.240
and they will just end
up somewhere by chance.

01:08:58.241 --> 01:09:00.273
And whoever walks through there...

01:09:00.274 --> 01:09:04.078
will not return to the
house that they just left.

01:09:05.622 --> 01:09:10.040
And I think that we need to find our way
back to our house before the comet passes...

01:09:10.041 --> 01:09:12.372
because we... once it...
once it passes,

01:09:12.372 --> 01:09:14.506
we might just be stuck
exact... here.

01:09:14.508 --> 01:09:16.975
Wherever we are.

01:09:17.774 --> 01:09:21.540
I don't want to be stuck here.

01:09:21.541 --> 01:09:23.807
If your theory is true...

01:09:23.808 --> 01:09:25.573
If we walk through the dark space,

01:09:25.573 --> 01:09:27.040
and it is a roulette wheel,

01:09:27.041 --> 01:09:29.174
there's no way we can be sure...

01:09:29.175 --> 01:09:34.106
that we would go back
to our original house.

01:09:34.107 --> 01:09:36.807
I think we just stay here.

01:09:36.808 --> 01:09:39.322
I think we're stuck here.

01:09:39.975 --> 01:09:42.474
I put it out near the gate.
Should be all right.

01:09:42.475 --> 01:09:45.839
If we all stay here,
we should be okay.

01:09:45.840 --> 01:09:47.774
Don't open it.

01:09:47.774 --> 01:09:51.439
Who is that?

01:09:51.441 --> 01:09:53.108
Oh.

01:09:53.109 --> 01:09:55.772
- What is it?
- Mike.

01:09:55.773 --> 01:09:59.074
Oh, fuck me.
Oh, jeez.

01:09:59.075 --> 01:10:00.840
"Mike, my friend, What is it?

01:10:00.841 --> 01:10:04.173
Beth plus book equals Trinidad Club.

01:10:04.174 --> 01:10:06.241
Don't let it happen,
whatever it takes, buddy."

01:10:06.242 --> 01:10:08.507
What is this?

01:10:08.508 --> 01:10:10.674
It's just this note.
It's... Mike had this...

01:10:10.675 --> 01:10:13.840
He had this crazy idea that maybe
if he left this note out there,

01:10:13.841 --> 01:10:15.274
it could stop them
getting the book.

01:10:15.275 --> 01:10:16.973
It's nothing.
It was a stupid idea.

01:10:16.974 --> 01:10:19.173
But our Mike didn't deliver it.
What is this?

01:10:19.174 --> 01:10:21.107
Just some crazy other Mike
running around. It's nothing.

01:10:21.108 --> 01:10:23.339
- You know what it is? What is this?
- We talked about it.

01:10:23.340 --> 01:10:25.040
What is it?
Really, it's nothing.

01:10:25.041 --> 01:10:27.208
- Just let it go, and...
- Then why can't you tell us?

01:10:27.209 --> 01:10:30.046
Beth?

01:10:33.841 --> 01:10:36.474
Mike, what is this?
Oh, shit.

01:10:36.475 --> 01:10:39.339
It's...

01:10:39.340 --> 01:10:40.940
Nothing.

01:10:40.941 --> 01:10:42.906
If it's nothing,
then why does my wife...

01:10:42.907 --> 01:10:44.707
have a fucking nosebleed?

01:10:44.708 --> 01:10:47.808
- Oh.
- Oh, honey. Oh, God. Oh, God.

01:10:47.809 --> 01:10:49.707
- Beth, what the hell is this?
- I told you.

01:10:49.708 --> 01:10:51.907
- I told you this was the worst.
- What is the idea?

01:10:51.908 --> 01:10:54.173
12 years ago.
Mike and Beth.

01:10:54.174 --> 01:10:56.073
- You've gotta be kidding me.
- He was gonna blackmail himself...

01:10:56.074 --> 01:11:00.174
- What is this?
- so they would not get the book.

01:11:00.175 --> 01:11:02.306
This is bad.
This is really bad.

01:11:02.307 --> 01:11:06.141
- Wait. You never told Hugh?
- It was on my to-do list.

01:11:06.142 --> 01:11:08.439
We have to just get
through the night, okay?

01:11:08.440 --> 01:11:11.606
Let's just try. He told you.
He said he told you about it.

01:11:11.607 --> 01:11:13.107
Why didn't you tell me?

01:11:13.108 --> 01:11:16.907
- Because you didn't say anything about it.
- Who else knew about this?

01:11:16.908 --> 01:11:18.906
Who else knew about this?

01:11:18.907 --> 01:11:21.439
- Lee, did you know about this?
- Yes.

01:11:21.440 --> 01:11:24.440
- Kevin, did you know?
- He told us. He told you. He...

01:11:24.441 --> 01:11:27.006
- Everybody knew about this.
- We thought you knew.

01:11:27.007 --> 01:11:29.373
Everybody knew about this except me?

01:11:29.374 --> 01:11:34.405
Hugh, listen. It's...
It's not what it seems. It's...

01:11:34.406 --> 01:11:38.274
- We don't even belong here.
- You are fucking too much, man.

01:11:38.275 --> 01:11:41.272
- You are fucking too much.
- Listen. We're visitors here.

01:11:41.273 --> 01:11:43.206
- This isn't our house.
- What are you talking about?

01:11:43.207 --> 01:11:44.807
This is Lee and Beth's house.

01:11:44.808 --> 01:11:48.074
You sleep with my wife, and
this is what you're telling me?

01:11:48.075 --> 01:11:49.540
Check your phone.
Is your phone broken?

01:11:49.541 --> 01:11:51.672
What the fuck does that
have to do with anything?

01:11:51.673 --> 01:11:54.906
- Is your phone broken?
- What the fuck does that have to do with anything?

01:11:54.907 --> 01:11:57.840
- Just do it.
- Show us.

01:11:57.841 --> 01:11:59.473
No. My phone is not broken.

01:11:59.474 --> 01:12:02.206
Now what does that have to do
with you sleeping with my wife?

01:12:02.207 --> 01:12:05.040
From the beginning of the
evening, your phone was broken.

01:12:05.041 --> 01:12:07.307
- No. Em's phone is broken.
- So is yours.

01:12:07.308 --> 01:12:10.074
Your... The box. The
first box that we got,

01:12:10.075 --> 01:12:11.974
we had, like, a random item.

01:12:11.975 --> 01:12:13.573
W-What w-was your random item?

01:12:13.574 --> 01:12:15.607
What the fuck does this
have to do with anything?

01:12:15.608 --> 01:12:17.807
Answer him.

01:12:17.808 --> 01:12:21.173
- The stapler.
- No, no, no.

01:12:21.174 --> 01:12:22.873
- What?
- We had an oven mitt.

01:12:22.874 --> 01:12:24.974
And ours was a ping-pong paddle.

01:12:24.975 --> 01:12:27.306
- What?
- Mine was a napkin.

01:12:27.307 --> 01:12:29.572
What the fuck are you talking about?

01:12:29.573 --> 01:12:33.573
Hugh, that is not my Lee. That is not
your Beth, and I am not your Mike.

01:12:33.574 --> 01:12:35.507
You... You aren't mad at me.

01:12:35.508 --> 01:12:38.336
W-We're in a different...
a different reality here.

01:12:38.337 --> 01:12:41.474
Yeah, we're in a different reality
because the reality where I am from,

01:12:41.475 --> 01:12:44.040
my best friend didn't
sleep with my wife.

01:12:44.041 --> 01:12:46.939
Hugh, do you not understand
what I'm saying?

01:12:46.940 --> 01:12:51.907
This all started tonight, and if there
are a million different realities,

01:12:51.908 --> 01:12:54.606
I have slept with your wife
in every one of them.

01:12:54.607 --> 01:12:57.874
- You fucking...
- No, no, no.

01:12:57.875 --> 01:13:01.807
Hugh! Hugh!

01:13:01.808 --> 01:13:04.073
Come on!

01:13:04.074 --> 01:13:06.138
- Are you okay?
- Yeah. Settle down.

01:13:06.139 --> 01:13:09.759
I'm gonna get some ice.
I'm gonna get some ice.

01:13:10.573 --> 01:13:13.873
Are you okay?

01:13:13.874 --> 01:13:17.640
Sit down.

01:13:17.641 --> 01:13:19.374
You okay, baby?

01:13:19.375 --> 01:13:21.673
- Here, let me give you a little of this.
- Yeah, yeah.

01:13:21.674 --> 01:13:26.239
Okay, I'm going to put something on it.
I'll put something on it.

01:13:26.874 --> 01:13:30.974
You know, I've made some... some
choices, that I'm stuck with. Um...

01:13:30.975 --> 01:13:36.140
I'm stuck here.

01:13:36.808 --> 01:13:40.006
I'm like the dead cat, right?

01:13:40.007 --> 01:13:41.572
This whole night we've
been worrying...

01:13:41.573 --> 01:13:46.973
there's some dark version
of us out there somewhere.

01:13:46.974 --> 01:13:49.877
What if we're the dark version?

01:13:50.675 --> 01:13:52.740
What's that?

01:13:52.741 --> 01:13:54.807
- All right.
- Goddamn it!

01:13:54.808 --> 01:13:59.005
Why didn't you tell me?

01:14:02.574 --> 01:14:05.105
There's someone in the house.

01:14:05.106 --> 01:14:07.206
Get the hell outta here!

01:14:07.207 --> 01:14:10.707
- Oh. No, no, no, no, no.
- Jesus. What's going on?

01:14:10.708 --> 01:14:12.305
- Is he all right?
- Are you okay?

01:14:12.306 --> 01:14:15.073
- Who the fuck was that?
- Mike? Mike?

01:14:15.074 --> 01:14:18.039
Does anybody know what to do?

01:14:18.040 --> 01:14:20.139
- Mike?
- Is he breathing?

01:14:20.140 --> 01:14:24.774
- Jesus Christ!
- Laurie, it's okay.

01:14:25.073 --> 01:14:27.274
- Calm down.
- Laurie, Laurie, stop.

01:14:27.275 --> 01:14:30.673
Laurie, Jesus.

01:14:30.674 --> 01:14:33.607
- Shh.
- Kevin, shut her the fuck up.

01:14:33.608 --> 01:14:35.239
It's okay, Laurie.

01:14:35.240 --> 01:14:37.573
Just breathe. You're all right.
You're all right.

01:14:37.574 --> 01:14:40.941
Em. Em.

01:14:40.942 --> 01:14:44.174
Em, where are you going?

01:14:45.374 --> 01:14:49.205
Just calm down.
It's all right.

01:14:49.206 --> 01:14:52.874
- Get off me!
- Get a rag. Get a towel. Anything.

01:14:52.875 --> 01:14:54.672
- Here, here, here, here.
- Get it off!

01:14:54.673 --> 01:14:57.706
- Get it off! I can't fucking stand blood.
- Okay. It's off.

01:14:57.707 --> 01:15:00.695
It'll be all right.
Just calm down.

01:15:51.540 --> 01:15:54.874
Get the fuck away.
Get the fuck away.

01:15:54.875 --> 01:15:58.178
You're scaring the shit
out of everybody.

01:15:58.408 --> 01:16:04.160
Who are you? Who are
you fucking people?

01:16:21.941 --> 01:16:23.939
And you said... All
you guys are crazy.

01:16:23.940 --> 01:16:27.972
You were always fucking crazy.

01:16:27.973 --> 01:16:29.540
She's bad news.

01:16:29.541 --> 01:16:32.949
It's been years we
haven't seen each other.

01:17:07.441 --> 01:17:10.473
You know, Vietnamese is
a pitch-based language.

01:17:10.474 --> 01:17:15.174
D.H.R. Yeah.

01:17:16.374 --> 01:17:21.075
It really is a pitch-based language.

01:17:21.873 --> 01:17:24.873
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:17:24.874 --> 01:17:27.998
Cheers.

01:17:59.774 --> 01:18:01.673
And I don't think
I'm working a lot.

01:18:01.674 --> 01:18:06.739
I have to work a lot, but
it's gonna be a nice balance.

01:18:06.740 --> 01:18:10.806
What are you gonna do while he's working?
What are you gonna do?

01:18:10.807 --> 01:18:12.607
I don't know.
Just hang out.

01:18:12.608 --> 01:18:14.106
- Investigate?
- Yeah, investigate.

01:18:14.107 --> 01:18:16.407
Fundraise. Get those
Vietnamese to invest in...

01:18:16.408 --> 01:18:20.506
- Fundraise in San Francisco.
- Invest in the Vietnamese.

01:18:20.507 --> 01:18:23.472
- It's supposed to be gorgeous, though.
- This time of year.

01:18:23.473 --> 01:18:25.805
My cousin lived over there
for about a year...

01:18:25.806 --> 01:18:27.339
and said it was just spectacular.

01:18:27.340 --> 01:18:31.740
- Have you been there before?
- No. Not Vietnam. Cambodia.

01:18:31.741 --> 01:18:33.273
Cambodia was awesome.

01:18:33.274 --> 01:18:35.139
Did you see Angkor Wat
when you were in Cambodia?

01:18:35.140 --> 01:18:37.973
- Yeah.
- Good times.

01:18:39.974 --> 01:18:42.907
Great.

01:18:43.374 --> 01:18:45.571
Picture this.

01:18:45.572 --> 01:18:47.673
- Whoa. What the hell was that?
- What was that?

01:18:47.674 --> 01:18:50.240
- It was like a car window, or something.
- It sounded like glass.

01:18:50.241 --> 01:18:52.073
It sounded like a windshield.

01:18:52.074 --> 01:18:53.639
That's mine.
That's mine.

01:18:53.640 --> 01:18:55.838
Should we get the, the
glowsticks to take outside?

01:18:55.839 --> 01:18:57.340
We're not going to a rave.

01:18:57.341 --> 01:19:00.172
You want to go to a rave, party man?

01:19:00.173 --> 01:19:02.406
I don't see anybody.

01:19:02.407 --> 01:19:04.339
You okay?

01:19:04.340 --> 01:19:07.772
- Whose is that right there?
- Oh, for fuck's sake. Seriously?

01:19:07.773 --> 01:19:11.439
- Oh, shit.
- Oh, baby.

01:19:11.440 --> 01:19:14.740
- I just got this. I just got this.
- I'm sorry.

01:19:14.741 --> 01:19:17.406
There's no structural damage.

01:19:17.407 --> 01:19:20.072
- Did they take anything?
- They didn't take my fucking...

01:19:20.073 --> 01:19:22.239
- They didn't take my stereo.
- Come on.

01:19:22.240 --> 01:19:25.473
Why don't we check
the rest of our cars,

01:19:25.474 --> 01:19:26.939
and see what's going on.

01:19:26.940 --> 01:19:28.572
- Yeah.
- Honey, where's our car?

01:19:28.573 --> 01:19:30.472
- In the driveway.
- All right.

01:19:30.473 --> 01:19:35.642
- Em, you good?
- Yeah. I'm right up here.

01:20:17.706 --> 01:20:20.073
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:20:20.074 --> 01:20:22.673
What are you doing?
We... Guys, she's in here.

01:20:22.674 --> 01:20:24.205
We were looking for you.

01:20:24.206 --> 01:20:27.806
- Oh, I was just, um, by my car.
- Oh.

01:20:27.807 --> 01:20:31.940
- You okay, babe?
- Yeah, I just... Yeah.

01:20:31.941 --> 01:20:34.439
- You got away from us.
- I did.

01:20:34.440 --> 01:20:37.307
I guess worse things could
happen at a dinner party.

01:20:37.308 --> 01:20:39.305
I went and got the...
the ring.

01:20:39.306 --> 01:20:42.805
No, I could stay here.
That's a good idea.

01:20:42.806 --> 01:20:45.107
What were you doing out there?

01:20:45.108 --> 01:20:49.106
Em. What were you doing out there?

01:20:49.107 --> 01:20:52.239
Um, the view is really beautiful
of the comet out there.

01:20:52.240 --> 01:20:54.871
- Oh.
- You came in that door?

01:20:54.872 --> 01:20:57.473
- Yeah.
- What's wrong with that door?

01:20:57.474 --> 01:21:00.540
That's the door to nowhere.
Don't you know?

01:21:00.541 --> 01:21:02.839
Okay. Let's go take a look.
Let's check it out.

01:21:02.840 --> 01:21:06.939
Everybody's sick of hearing
about the feng shui.

01:21:06.940 --> 01:21:10.006
- God, it's freezing outside.
- Come on.

01:21:10.007 --> 01:21:12.672
You mentioned it.
Let's look at it.

01:21:12.673 --> 01:21:14.639
How come we never use this patio?

01:21:14.640 --> 01:21:16.406
Well, we never have comets.

01:21:16.407 --> 01:21:19.573
Oh, my God.

01:21:19.574 --> 01:21:21.373
W-What's it doing?

01:21:21.374 --> 01:21:23.407
It's breaking up.

01:21:23.408 --> 01:21:25.673
- Is that what they do?
- Yeah, I guess so.

01:21:25.674 --> 01:21:28.973
So, Em, is Katherine Meriss gonna understudy
your life while you're gone for a month?

01:21:28.974 --> 01:21:32.007
Oh, no one can.
Ooh.

01:21:32.540 --> 01:21:36.707
- I like that.
- Oh, come on.

01:21:38.740 --> 01:21:41.172
I wish we could roast
marshmallows on that meteor.

01:21:41.173 --> 01:21:44.531
A long stick.

01:22:32.740 --> 01:22:34.572
Yeah?

01:22:34.573 --> 01:22:36.506
- Em? You okay?
- Yeah?

01:22:36.507 --> 01:22:39.172
Yeah, I'm fine.
The toilet just got backed up.

01:22:39.173 --> 01:22:42.005
You can't use that one. You
gotta use the main one, okay?

01:22:42.006 --> 01:22:45.938
Okay.
I'll be right out.

01:23:28.640 --> 01:23:32.446
- Oh, my God.
- Em. Em.

01:24:22.275 --> 01:24:24.940
Hey. You're up.

01:24:24.941 --> 01:24:29.852
I'll make some breakfast. It'll
be ready in, like, five minutes.

01:24:49.607 --> 01:24:51.905
Oh, hi.
You feeling better?

01:24:51.906 --> 01:24:54.005
- Yeah.
- Okay.

01:24:54.006 --> 01:24:57.115
I'm gonna get dressed.
I'll be back.

01:25:29.674 --> 01:25:32.873
Morning.

01:25:32.874 --> 01:25:35.240
You okay, babe?

01:25:35.241 --> 01:25:38.006
Are you okay?

01:25:38.007 --> 01:25:41.708
You totally passed out last night.

01:25:42.506 --> 01:25:46.239
You were mumbling.
I put you on the couch.

01:25:46.240 --> 01:25:49.842
Found that in the bathroom.

01:25:56.041 --> 01:26:00.374
That's weird.
It's you calling me.

01:26:01.173 --> 01:26:04.274
Hello?

01:26:14.508 --> 01:26:18.609
<i>When you sing</i>

01:26:20.406 --> 01:26:25.075

<i>Galaxies, they flood the streets</i>

01:26:57.039 --> 01:27:01.805
