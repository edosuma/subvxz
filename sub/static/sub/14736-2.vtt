that's guaranteed to impress
everyone in our class.

It's the routine Cyd
and I were going to do
at our sixth grade dance.

01:14.325 --> 01:16.407
The one we never got to do
because the power went out.

was the best thing that
ever happened to us.

of people

01:26.507 --> 01:28.469
and text them to
the whole school.

01:28.469 --> 01:32.593
It was like a wedgie
where standard
messaging rates applied.

we would have been B-Blasted

that jumping to sixth grade
would shatter
the space-time condominium

10:45.065 --> 10:46.356
Chet, what are you doing?

10:46.356 --> 10:47.858
I panicked!

10:50.320 --> 10:52.272
Hey, guys, I brought
three comic books.

10:52.272 --> 10:54.074
I figured I could
read this one,

10:54.074 --> 10:56.947
you could read this one,
and you could read this one.

10:56.947 --> 10:59.119
And then we could trade,
and you could read this one,

10:59.119 --> 11:01.952
you could read this one,
and I could read this one.

11:01.952 --> 11:04.124
And then we could trade,
and you could read this one,

11:04.124 --> 11:07.287
I could read this one,
and you could read this one.

11:07.287 --> 11:09.289
Unless, you've already
read this one.

11:11.211 --> 11:13.253
We got to get Neil
out of here.

11:13.253 --> 11:16.256
Relax, Bret.
Let's just let him hang out.
Nothing's gonna happen.

11:18.008 --> 11:20.060
Oops.

11:20.060 --> 11:23.103
You call that nothing?
He's trashing the place!

11:27.017 --> 11:28.979
Maybe the B-Squad's
forgotten all about me.

11:28.979 --> 11:31.401
(CELL PHONE CHIMES)
 They just B-Blasted you.

11:31.401 --> 11:32.983
Let's get this over with.

(HEN CLUCKING)

11:38.238 --> 11:41.081
(CHICK CHIRPING)

11:41.081 --> 11:42.993
This is so bad.

11:42.993 --> 11:45.125
Look on the bright side.

11:45.125 --> 11:48.248
In the future, when people
can actually lay eggs,
this won't be funny anymore.

11:48.248 --> 11:52.042
No, Naldo,
I mean this video is so bad.

11:52.042 --> 11:54.044
(CHUCKLES LIGHTLY)
It's just dumb.

11:54.044 --> 11:56.426
I can't believe this is what
I was so afraid of.

11:56.426 --> 11:58.969
(MUSIC PLAYING)

11:58.969 --> 12:00.260
Look at everyone.

12:00.260 --> 12:03.103
They're not having
a good time because
they're terrified of

12:03.103 --> 12:04.394
what other people
will think of them.

12:04.394 --> 12:07.057
(CHUCKLES)
Except Principal Dilmore.

12:07.057 --> 12:09.189
NALDO: That guy's dancing
like nobody's watching.

12:09.189 --> 12:11.061
And everybody's watching.

12:12.312 --> 12:14.354
But he doesn't care.

12:14.354 --> 12:16.156
He doesn't care
what he looks like.

12:16.156 --> 12:18.358
He doesn't care
that he can't dance.

12:18.358 --> 12:20.280
He doesn't even care
that his fly's open.

12:20.280 --> 12:23.994
To be fair, I don't think
he knows his fly's open.

12:23.994 --> 12:26.286
Because he's having
too much fun!

12:26.286 --> 12:29.419
Naldo, we should all be
having that much fun!

12:29.419 --> 12:33.293
Shelby was right.
We have to do that dance.

12:33.293 --> 12:35.465
I got to go find her.

12:35.465 --> 12:37.467
Don't tell anyone
about Dilmore's fly.

12:37.467 --> 12:39.429
We should probably
be discreet about that.

12:41.301 --> 12:42.342
(ZIPS ZIPPER)

12:48.098 --> 12:50.230
What are you doing
in a trash can?

12:50.230 --> 12:51.441
It's not as weird
as it looks like.

12:51.441 --> 12:54.274
I climbed in here because of
my dead grandfather's shoes!

12:54.274 --> 12:55.395
Oh, you're right
that's not weird.

12:55.395 --> 12:59.239
(CHUCKLING)
But it is super creepy.

12:59.239 --> 13:01.201
No, his shoes
are too big for me

13:01.201 --> 13:04.204
so I tripped
and spilled punch
on my pants.

13:04.204 --> 13:07.167
Right in the "hot zone."

13:07.167 --> 13:10.000
(SIGHS) I climbed in here
so the B-Squad wouldn't
blast a video of me!

13:10.330 --> 13:11.461
(BIANCA LAUGHS)

13:11.461 --> 13:14.294
Oh, no!
I know that laugh.

BIANCA:
Up here, losers!

13:16.967 --> 13:19.219
It's the B-Squad.
(WHIMPERING)

13:19.219 --> 13:22.382
This is too good.
I think he's crying.

13:22.382 --> 13:24.424
(WHIMPERING)

13:24.424 --> 13:26.266
No. No, Barry, stop that!

13:26.266 --> 13:28.518
This is why you got
the nickname
Barry Cry-senberg.

13:28.518 --> 13:33.393
(CHUCKLES) Barry Cry-senberg?
You mind if I use that?

13:33.393 --> 13:35.435
Yes! Yes, I mind!

13:35.435 --> 13:40.320
Good. Just wanted to
make sure it would really
sting before I blast it.

13:40.320 --> 13:42.242
And send. (CHUCKLES)

13:43.243 --> 13:45.285
That's where we laugh.

13:45.285 --> 13:48.368
Ugh, Jennifer!
You're the worst Brooke ever!

13:51.121 --> 13:55.125
They've ruined us.
We got blasted just
like Dilmore and Cyd!

13:55.125 --> 13:57.127
Cyd got blasted?

13:57.127 --> 13:59.089
(SIGHS) She was right.

13:59.089 --> 14:01.341
The power going out
was the luckiest thing
that ever happened to us.

14:01.341 --> 14:04.304
We never should have
come back to do
our dance routine.

14:04.304 --> 14:06.386
Shelby, we got to get
you out of here.

14:06.386 --> 14:08.388
Yeah, so I can find
Cyd and go home.

14:08.388 --> 14:10.470
No, so you can do
that dance routine.

14:10.470 --> 14:14.314

take all the focus off
of my humiliation.

could be home any minute!

kick it with Neil.

a grade A dingus.

Don't say anything
you can't take back.

accelerate this trash
at 180 meters per second,

break down that door.

Boys, I told you expressly
not to open the door.

You promised
you would be responsible
and you let me down.

17:55.615 --> 18:00.460
I'm sorry, Dad. Bret
told me I shouldn't let
Neil stay, but I did.

18:00.460 --> 18:05.335
And I'm sorry too, Dad.
I vacuumed Chet's shirt off.

18:05.335 --> 18:08.628

Maybe we're not ready
to be left home alone.

of you boys,

18:10.470 --> 18:12.552

going to have to punish you.

Where is Mom?

18:14.384 --> 18:16.386
Oh, she went to pay
the bill and I went
to get the car and...

(GASPS) I drove home
without your mother!

you clean up your mess
and I'll clean up mine.

to buy a diamond necklace

Don't turn off
the power.

18:38.408 --> 18:42.452

Middle school is
scary and judgey

18:42.452 --> 18:44.624
and I don't want
to be here anymore.

18:44.624 --> 18:47.747
We were better off
not doing the dance
the first time around.

18:47.747 --> 18:51.511
Maybe the power going out
was fate saving us
from humiliation.

18:51.511 --> 18:52.802
It wasn't fate.

18:53.713 --> 18:55.595
It was me.

18:55.595 --> 18:57.517
What?

18:57.517 --> 19:00.350
I turned off the power.

19:00.350 --> 19:02.562
I didn't want to do our dance
because I was scared of

19:02.562 --> 19:04.564
what other people
would think.

19:04.564 --> 19:06.766
Well, I totally get it.

thought of me,

have fun.

is I'll be out there

my best friend.

I'm gonna do it.

punch mouth, dance pits,

and the look of two girls
who have done something
highly choreographed.

21:30.910 --> 21:33.833

We made it awesome.

21:33.833 --> 21:35.675
Before we went back
and fixed it,

21:35.675 --> 21:38.548
you ripped your pants
and Barry spent the whole
time in a trash can.

21:38.548 --> 21:39.589
But I did rip my pants.

21:39.589 --> 21:40.680

and don't worry about

the best time.

the suits are too much?
 (CLICKS TONGUE) No.

22:03.943 --> 22:04.994
They cost $2,000.

22:04.994 --> 22:07.907
Oh, yeah,
that's way too much.

22:07.907 --> 22:11.621

your sixth grade dance once.

are comin' home clean?
