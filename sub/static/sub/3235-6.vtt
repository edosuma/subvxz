00:50.342 --> 00:52.135
No, no, no!

02:13.342 --> 02:14.842
Hey.

03:44.850 --> 03:46.601
It's me.

03:46.768 --> 03:50.021
I wanted to say that I was thinking
about you and the kids.

03:54.568 --> 03:56.319
I love you.

03:59.865 --> 04:01.866
It's me.

04:02.034 --> 04:07.204
I just wanted to say that I was thinking
about you and the kids, and...

04:27.434 --> 04:30.937
- Morning.
- Afternoon.

04:31.104 --> 04:34.440
Oh, really? Jesus.

04:34.942 --> 04:37.568
You shouldn't have let me sleep.

04:37.819 --> 04:39.737
You needed it.

04:52.167 --> 04:55.378
Skyler, I don't entirely remember
what happened last night.

04:55.545 --> 04:58.589
I mean, I might have said
some things that...

04:58.757 --> 05:01.592
Did you know
this Gale Boetticher person?

05:03.178 --> 05:07.223
- Skyler, I can't even focus on...
- Gale Boetticher.

05:07.933 --> 05:09.809
Did you know him?

05:10.727 --> 05:12.353
My God. What...?

05:12.521 --> 05:15.523
What exactly did I say last night?

05:15.691 --> 05:17.650
Just enough.

05:18.694 --> 05:20.903
Did you work together?

05:27.160 --> 05:29.036
Who killed him?

05:29.997 --> 05:32.581
Was it the people you work for?

05:33.291 --> 05:35.793
Definitely not.

05:35.961 --> 05:37.378
Was it somebody who...

05:38.964 --> 05:43.843
...at some point,
might wanna do the same to you?

05:46.972 --> 05:51.225
I seriously doubt it. No.

05:55.105 --> 05:56.731
God.

05:59.776 --> 06:02.028
Oh, God.

06:08.201 --> 06:11.787
I think I know what happened
last night, Walt.

06:11.955 --> 06:15.833
I know exactly what happened
last night. I drank too much wine.

06:16.001 --> 06:19.378
You told Hank...

06:19.713 --> 06:23.174
...that the man he was looking for
might still be out there.

06:23.341 --> 06:28.012
That it might not be this Boetticher
after all.

06:28.180 --> 06:34.018
And I was up all night, wondering
why you would say that to him.

06:34.186 --> 06:35.728
Because I was drunk, Skyler.

06:35.896 --> 06:40.107
No, but then I was remembering
your black eye.

06:40.275 --> 06:44.153
Your business disagreement
that you don't wanna talk about.

06:44.321 --> 06:48.449
Look, I don't want to talk
about any of this. Ever.

06:48.617 --> 06:51.035
The firewall, all right?

06:51.203 --> 06:53.162
Church and state.

06:53.330 --> 06:56.123
That's how we need to approach
this thing.

06:59.044 --> 07:02.671
And then I remembered the message
you left me the other day...

07:03.757 --> 07:06.217
...when you said you loved me.

07:09.262 --> 07:12.264
When I heard that,
I thought that maybe you...

07:12.432 --> 07:16.852
I don't know, that you were regretting
what's happened between us.

07:17.020 --> 07:18.312
And I get that.

07:18.939 --> 07:21.107
After last night, I...

07:25.862 --> 07:28.531
Walt, I think you're scared.

07:28.949 --> 07:32.451
I think that message
was some kind of goodbye.

07:32.619 --> 07:34.370
No, Skyler.

07:34.538 --> 07:37.748
- I think last night was a cry for help.
- Oh, Jesus.

07:37.916 --> 07:39.333
A cry for help?

07:39.501 --> 07:42.336
I think some part of you
wants Hank to catch you.

07:44.881 --> 07:47.049
That is just...

07:47.217 --> 07:52.346
That is it exactly. Yes.

07:52.514 --> 07:54.682
You're like Dr. Joyce Brothers here.

07:54.850 --> 07:55.933
God.

07:56.101 --> 07:57.893
At least this would all be over.

07:58.061 --> 08:02.523
Yeah, yeah, oh, there's a tremendous
weight just lifted off of me.

08:02.691 --> 08:04.859
Now I understand myself.

08:05.026 --> 08:06.652
Thank you. Thank you.

08:06.820 --> 08:09.530
Walt, I've said it before.

08:09.698 --> 08:13.033
If you are in danger,
we go to the police.

08:13.201 --> 08:18.622
- I don't wanna hear about the police.
- I do not say that lightly.

08:18.790 --> 08:20.916
I know what it could do
to this family.

08:21.084 --> 08:26.422
But if it's the only real choice we have,
if it's either that or you getting shot...

08:26.590 --> 08:28.591
I don't wanna hear about the police.

08:28.758 --> 08:33.011
You're not some hardened criminal,
Walt. You are in over your head.

08:33.179 --> 08:35.472
That's what we'll tell them, the truth.

08:35.640 --> 08:38.267
- That is not the truth.
- Of course it is.

08:38.434 --> 08:41.770
A schoolteacher, cancer,
desperate for money...

08:41.938 --> 08:45.149
- We're done here.
- Roped into working... Unable to quit.

08:45.317 --> 08:47.401
You told me that yourself, Walt.

08:47.903 --> 08:51.488
Jesus, what was I thinking?
Walt, please.

08:51.656 --> 08:55.451
Let's both of us stop trying
to justify this whole thing...

08:55.619 --> 08:57.328
...and admit you're in danger.

08:59.789 --> 09:02.416
Who are you talking to right now?

09:04.502 --> 09:07.338
Who is it you think you see?

09:09.216 --> 09:11.800
Do you know
how much I make a year?

09:11.968 --> 09:14.803
I mean, even if I told you,
you wouldn't believe it.

09:14.971 --> 09:18.515
You know what would happen
if I decided to stop going in to work?

09:18.683 --> 09:23.020
A business big enough that it could be
listed on the NASDAQ goes belly up.

09:23.188 --> 09:26.899
Disappears. it ceases to exist
without me. No.

09:27.067 --> 09:31.153
You clearly don't know who you're
talking to, so let me clue you in.

09:31.321 --> 09:35.324
I am not in danger, Skyler.
I am the danger.

09:35.492 --> 09:39.620
A guy opens his door and gets shot,
and you think that of me? No.

09:39.788 --> 09:42.831
I am the one who knocks.

10:23.081 --> 10:25.374
Look, I was...

10:40.140 --> 10:42.057
Skyler?

11:03.538 --> 11:06.999
Here we are. Just like you left it.

11:09.294 --> 11:11.712
And where is your pretty wife?

11:12.380 --> 11:15.466
She has other business to attend to.

11:15.633 --> 11:22.181
Well, like I say to her,
place sells as is. Understand?

11:22.891 --> 11:24.933
Yes, I understand.

11:25.101 --> 11:27.144
Good, good.

11:27.312 --> 11:29.897
I don't want her coming back
with more demands.

11:30.065 --> 11:32.649
She gave me hard time
when we settled on price.

11:32.817 --> 11:36.111
We're all on the same page, Bogdan.

11:37.655 --> 11:40.366
So here is everything you need.

11:40.533 --> 11:43.410
- I keep very good files.
- Thank you.

11:44.204 --> 11:47.081
So you are the boss now, huh?

11:50.668 --> 11:52.669
You think you're ready?

11:54.297 --> 11:57.091
Yes, I think so.

11:59.219 --> 12:02.304
Being boss is tough.

12:03.098 --> 12:07.893
I know you think I was hard on you,
but you'll learn.

12:08.061 --> 12:10.938
Being in charge is not easy.

12:11.523 --> 12:13.023
It takes hard work.

12:13.191 --> 12:16.568
- You've seen me work hard, Bogdan.
- Yeah?

12:16.736 --> 12:18.821
I don't know.

12:18.988 --> 12:20.948
Not so much, maybe.

12:21.116 --> 12:23.659
But maybe when you are the boss...

12:23.827 --> 12:27.830
...you will just keep your feet up
and relax.

12:30.375 --> 12:33.210
The real important thing...

12:33.378 --> 12:34.962
And not everyone knows this.

12:35.130 --> 12:37.881
...Is to be tough.

12:39.426 --> 12:43.262
Boss has to be tough.

12:43.680 --> 12:46.432
Has to say no to people.

12:46.641 --> 12:52.980
Has to make cashiers
wipe down cars...

12:53.148 --> 12:56.900
...even if they don't want to.

12:58.653 --> 13:02.030
Can you be tough, waiter?

13:06.536 --> 13:08.036
I am sure you can handle.

13:08.204 --> 13:13.292
And if not,
you can always call your wife, no?

13:21.009 --> 13:22.634
- Always sticky.
- Yeah.

13:22.802 --> 13:24.428
No problem.

13:26.598 --> 13:28.599
As is.

13:43.364 --> 13:48.619
Who'd have thought that someday
I would be handing these keys to you?

14:04.052 --> 14:07.596
Many years. Almost forgot.

14:12.852 --> 14:14.561
Bogdan.

14:18.066 --> 14:19.525
As is.

15:34.058 --> 15:35.851
Thank you.

16:11.554 --> 16:12.679
You okay there?

16:14.891 --> 16:16.725
I'm fine.

16:19.020 --> 16:21.855
Just not using is...

16:31.324 --> 16:33.158
Eat something.

17:07.234 --> 17:08.819
Yeah?

17:10.154 --> 17:12.446
That's right, both of them.

17:13.281 --> 17:14.866
All right.

17:15.827 --> 17:17.953
I'm on my way.

17:19.872 --> 17:21.832
You need any help?

17:24.544 --> 17:26.002
No.

17:45.565 --> 17:47.983
You want me to call her back?

17:48.484 --> 17:51.194
No. No.

17:53.114 --> 17:57.284
What exactly did she say?
I mean, exactly.

17:58.494 --> 18:03.457
Just, you know, she asked if I was okay
and not to worry.

18:03.624 --> 18:05.292
Like that.

18:06.794 --> 18:12.382
Any rough timetable on this thing,
as to when she's coming home?

18:15.970 --> 18:18.889
It's about the gambling, right?

18:20.600 --> 18:23.518
Well, it's kind of hard to...

18:23.686 --> 18:25.771
Dad, she can't understand.

18:25.938 --> 18:30.525
It's not like you're doing this
on purpose. You can't help it.

18:31.527 --> 18:33.570
It's not that simple.

18:33.738 --> 18:38.992
Look, you have a disease.
It's like you're an alcoholic, right?

18:39.160 --> 18:42.746
- No, it's not. Not at all.
- Yes, it is. I read online.

18:42.914 --> 18:45.665
She's not even allowed
to be mad at you.

18:45.833 --> 18:48.585
She can't be mad at you
about the cancer, can she?

18:48.753 --> 18:51.213
Son, these are two
very different things.

18:51.380 --> 18:54.758
Not really.
Gambling addiction is a sickness.

18:54.926 --> 18:57.594
- You can't...
- Listen, what is going on with me...

18:57.762 --> 19:00.430
...is not about some disease.
It's about choices.

19:00.598 --> 19:02.140
Choices that I have made.

19:02.975 --> 19:05.018
Choices I stand by.

19:14.278 --> 19:16.947
You're not moving back in, are you?

19:24.831 --> 19:26.248
No.

19:32.129 --> 19:37.175
Hey, you know what?
School can wait.

19:37.343 --> 19:41.847
Why don't we take a little detour?

19:42.557 --> 19:45.141
What kind of detour?

19:46.310 --> 19:48.019
You'll see.

19:52.233 --> 19:55.610
Charlie, pick up line three.
Line three, Charlie.

19:58.573 --> 20:03.827
I think it's time we got you
your own car. What do you think?

20:05.162 --> 20:06.621
What?

20:07.957 --> 20:12.085
I think if you're gonna buy me off...

20:12.587 --> 20:14.921
...buy me off.

20:16.841 --> 20:20.176
Get an attendant over to the lot.

20:39.030 --> 20:42.949
- Amazing. it's amazing.
- Yeah. it's good-looking.

20:44.160 --> 20:46.995
That's good. I'm glad you like it.

20:47.163 --> 20:50.832
- I do. Thank you, Dad.
- All right. You're welcome.

21:07.391 --> 21:08.767
So you're here.

21:09.769 --> 21:11.436
Yeah.

21:14.398 --> 21:16.775
You're actually here? To work?

21:17.860 --> 21:20.946
Yeah, man. Jesus.

21:21.113 --> 21:22.530
Jesse.

21:23.908 --> 21:25.283
Come here.

21:25.451 --> 21:28.453
- All right, I need an update.
- Update on what?

21:28.621 --> 21:33.041
An update on these little field trips
that you've been taking with Mike.

21:33.209 --> 21:38.004
I told you already. We pick up money.
Check on things. Stuff like that.

21:38.839 --> 21:43.969
And you're his bodyguard, right?
What? That's what you said.

21:44.136 --> 21:46.054
I said I guarded him.

21:46.222 --> 21:51.017
Like backup, like a second set of eyes.
Everybody needs backup, right?

21:52.019 --> 21:53.269
And this has to be you?

21:53.437 --> 21:59.067
It can't be, I don't know, Tyrus or any
of the couple dozen muscle-heads...

21:59.235 --> 22:03.279
...that Gus has working for him?
It has to be Jesse Pinkman.

22:03.447 --> 22:07.534
Why? What, is there something
about you that I don't know?

22:07.702 --> 22:10.036
Are you a former Navy SEAL?

22:10.204 --> 22:12.580
Your hands registered
as lethal weapons?

22:12.748 --> 22:13.832
Register this.

22:14.000 --> 22:17.502
All I'm saying is that
do you not even question this?

22:17.670 --> 22:21.006
Do you really believe that you mean
anything to these people?

22:21.173 --> 22:24.259
Not trying to insult. Just trying to
make you see things.

22:24.427 --> 22:28.304
I see they can't outright kill me,
but they don't want me getting high.

22:28.472 --> 22:32.851
I see this thing probably started
as Gus getting Mike to babysit me.

22:33.477 --> 22:34.978
But you know what?

22:35.146 --> 22:40.025
I saved Mike from getting robbed,
even killed, maybe.

22:40.192 --> 22:43.987
So maybe I'm not such a loser
after all.

22:46.574 --> 22:49.784
I mean, what if it...? Oh, God.

22:58.502 --> 23:01.963
- All right. what if it's all just a setup?
- What?

23:02.131 --> 23:06.384
What if this robbery that you stopped
wasn't even real?

23:06.552 --> 23:09.804
I mean, think about it.
Your first day out guarding Mike.

23:09.972 --> 23:12.390
He steps out for one second
and what happens?

23:12.558 --> 23:15.643
- You immediately get robbed.
- You are such an asshole.

23:15.811 --> 23:19.314
Keep your friends close,
your enemies closer. Like you said...

23:19.482 --> 23:23.151
...Gus can't kill you because of me,
he knows I won't stand for it.

23:23.319 --> 23:25.361
He hates the fact that he needs me.

23:25.529 --> 23:29.240
What does he do? He goes to work
driving a wedge between you and me.

23:29.408 --> 23:32.118
If you'd been there,
you'd know it wasn't a setup.

23:32.286 --> 23:35.830
Wait a minute. How long
did those guys chase you, huh?

23:35.998 --> 23:39.876
Because the way you describe it,
they gave up pretty damn easy.

23:40.252 --> 23:45.632
No, no, this whole thing, all of this...

23:47.218 --> 23:49.594
...it's all about me.

24:36.642 --> 24:38.184
Hello?

24:40.146 --> 24:42.689
Look, just hang on.

24:47.361 --> 24:48.736
Yeah?

24:49.530 --> 24:51.114
I'll be right up.

24:53.534 --> 24:56.411
- What?
- I gotta go.

24:56.579 --> 25:00.290
What? Am I supposed to clean all this
on my own?

25:03.836 --> 25:05.628
Hey.

25:09.508 --> 25:11.050
God...

25:29.737 --> 25:32.739
Buenos dias, ladies, buenos dias.

25:32.907 --> 25:34.490
Do you speak English?

25:34.658 --> 25:37.202
- No.
- No, okay.

25:39.079 --> 25:41.080
Help, help.

25:49.465 --> 25:51.925
I need help to clean. Yes.

26:05.064 --> 26:08.149
- Yes, muy bueno. it's just this...
- No.

26:08.901 --> 26:13.488
No, no, no.

26:21.038 --> 26:22.914
No, no, ladies.

26:35.177 --> 26:39.222
Let me see, let me see. I tell you what.
I tell you what. Look, look.

26:39.390 --> 26:41.140
Universal language.

26:46.146 --> 26:48.314
This one for you. Yeah, sÃ­.

26:48.482 --> 26:52.026
SÃ­, Presidente Grant.
Very important man.

26:56.031 --> 26:58.992
Mas dinero after the...

27:01.870 --> 27:03.079
Are we good?

27:03.247 --> 27:07.542
I think we're good. I think we listened
to you. Please, por favor, por favor.

27:10.212 --> 27:12.672
Please, por favor, por favor.

27:13.549 --> 27:15.508
Yes.

29:55.085 --> 29:56.210
What's the deal?

29:58.881 --> 30:03.843
Well, the deal is,
we're watching that house.

30:04.386 --> 30:07.138
Couple down on the left
with the tree in the front.

30:07.306 --> 30:09.182
Yeah? What for?

30:09.349 --> 30:11.767
A little birdie told me
there's some guys...

30:11.935 --> 30:15.188
...that have 3 pounds of our product
which they're selling.

30:15.355 --> 30:18.649
And which they sure as hell
didn't get from us.

30:19.610 --> 30:22.695
So, what's the plan?

30:23.739 --> 30:25.323
I just told you.

30:25.491 --> 30:28.242
We sit here and watch that house...

30:28.410 --> 30:31.245
...until one of our entrepreneurs
pops his head out.

30:31.413 --> 30:35.124
Then we ask a few questions
and get our property back.

30:36.502 --> 30:39.212
Why don't you just go
break the door down...

30:39.379 --> 30:42.340
...pistol-whip those bitches
and show them who's boss?

30:42.508 --> 30:47.053
Because a little birdie also told me
these guys are into the product...

30:47.221 --> 30:49.347
...and most likely armed.

30:49.515 --> 30:53.059
Now, what you may not know
about meth-heads...

30:53.435 --> 30:55.436
Or maybe you do.

30:55.604 --> 30:58.022
They're kind of unpredictable.

30:58.190 --> 31:02.235
I don't care for unpredictable.
So we wait.

31:03.946 --> 31:08.115
Sorry to burst your bubble, kid,
but that's 90 percent of the job.

31:09.326 --> 31:13.287
Don't worry. I brought sandwiches.

31:16.083 --> 31:17.875
Yes, sir.

31:21.505 --> 31:24.924
Pimento cheese. How's that sound?

31:32.641 --> 31:33.808
Where you going?

31:34.017 --> 31:37.979
You said they're selling right?
Maybe I'm looking to buy.

31:45.904 --> 31:47.071
Who the hell are you?

31:47.656 --> 31:49.615
- Tucker! Tucker!
- I'm here to buy.

31:49.783 --> 31:52.368
- Will you shut the damn door?
- Not my question.

31:52.536 --> 31:56.330
Name's Diesel. Heard you
maybe had some of the blue.

31:56.498 --> 31:59.208
- Tucker. Shut the door, Tucker! Tucker!
- I just...

31:59.376 --> 32:02.086
- Just looking for a teenth, yo.
- Tucker!

32:02.254 --> 32:04.380
- Come on, help a brother out.
- Tucker!

32:04.548 --> 32:08.050
- Will you shut the damn door?
- We don't sell to strangers.

32:08.218 --> 32:10.553
- Tucker!
- Get off the porch, asshole.

32:10.721 --> 32:13.222
- Will you shut the door?
- All right already!

32:13.390 --> 32:15.349
Tucker!

32:48.300 --> 32:51.093
Guess we'll go with Plan A, then.

33:05.859 --> 33:09.904
- Pop the trunk, would you?
- Why?

33:10.072 --> 33:13.324
- There's something in there I need.
- And what would that be?

33:13.492 --> 33:15.910
I'm getting those pricks
out of that house.

33:16.078 --> 33:18.996
Oh, your first attempt
being such a wild success?

33:19.164 --> 33:22.583
You may know this whole
Pl sit-in-the-car business...

33:22.751 --> 33:25.211
...but I know meth-heads.

34:16.679 --> 34:18.389
What are you doing?

34:19.474 --> 34:20.599
Digging.

34:21.643 --> 34:23.143
Why?

34:24.521 --> 34:26.522
You know why.

34:27.190 --> 34:28.815
How deep are you going?

34:28.984 --> 34:32.820
I don't know.
How deep do you think it is?

34:36.491 --> 34:38.199
Pretty deep.

34:44.916 --> 34:50.337
Hey, you mind taking over
for a minute?

34:51.047 --> 34:53.841
Yeah, sure.

35:03.518 --> 35:08.522
- Hey, mind if I use your john?
- Yeah.

35:34.674 --> 35:36.550
Tucker.

35:38.386 --> 35:39.986
Tucker!

35:52.317 --> 35:54.401
Who the hell are you?

35:54.569 --> 35:56.278
- I just...
- Who the hell are you?

35:56.446 --> 35:59.824
It's cool. Hey, I'm a friend of Tucker's.

35:59.991 --> 36:05.663
- What do you want?
- I just wanna buy some of the blue.

36:05.831 --> 36:07.623
It's not for sale.

36:09.209 --> 36:11.418
I know you were selling it earlier...

36:11.586 --> 36:15.631
- Oh, yeah? How do you know that?
- Tucker told me.

36:15.799 --> 36:18.884
Yeah, Tucker needs to learn
to keep his damn mouth shut.

36:19.052 --> 36:21.220
Tucker! Tucker!

36:22.722 --> 36:26.350
So you gonna hook me up?

36:26.518 --> 36:30.813
Don't have enough for all
of Tucker's asshole friends. Tucker!

36:31.231 --> 36:35.276
You know, I think he's outside.
You wanna just go outside...

36:35.443 --> 36:40.698
- Tucker! Tucker!
- Hey, hey. Let's go find Tucker.

36:40.866 --> 36:42.616
Okay? Let's go outside.

36:42.784 --> 36:47.413
I don't have enough for you,
all right?

36:47.581 --> 36:52.668
Yeah. yeah. Yeah, I get it. Okay.

36:52.836 --> 36:57.131
- I don't wanna start any trouble.
- Trouble? What's that mean? Trouble?

36:57.299 --> 37:00.384
No, no, no.
I'm just saying we're cool, okay?

37:00.552 --> 37:01.802
- We're good.
- What?

37:01.970 --> 37:04.305
You can't know that.
What does that mean?

37:04.472 --> 37:08.767
You don't put thoughts in my head.
You don't put thoughts in my head.

37:08.935 --> 37:12.313
- Absolutely. You're right. You're right.
- Tucker?

37:17.652 --> 37:19.236
You...

37:54.022 --> 37:56.023
Here you go, Maria.

37:56.191 --> 37:57.733
Veronica.

37:57.901 --> 38:00.069
Ilia, gracias.

38:07.535 --> 38:10.120
I missed that one.
I'm sure it was good.

38:20.966 --> 38:23.050
Wait, where you taking them?

38:23.218 --> 38:27.388
- Come on, Tyrus, what are you doing?
- I'm putting them on a bus.

38:27.555 --> 38:30.557
- Why? What bus?
- One that takes them back to Honduras.

38:30.725 --> 38:33.268
Hey, wait a second. Wait a minute.

38:34.688 --> 38:38.107
Wait, wait. This was my idea.
Don't punish them.

38:38.274 --> 38:41.151
You tell Gus to blame me, not them.

38:41.820 --> 38:43.654
He does.

39:08.013 --> 39:09.513
Give us a minute, will you?

39:22.068 --> 39:24.028
We won't be too long.

39:32.287 --> 39:34.997
The crew that hit our truck
gave away the cargo...

39:35.165 --> 39:37.166
...to a couple local nobodies.

39:37.333 --> 39:40.919
Very disciplined of them,
not keeping anything for themselves.

39:41.087 --> 39:43.881
It was all about sending a message.

39:44.215 --> 39:46.842
Which they did, literally.

39:47.010 --> 39:49.553
It was written on the bucket lid.

39:50.138 --> 39:51.972
"Ready to talk?"

39:52.182 --> 39:55.434
That, I believe,
is the English translation.

39:58.480 --> 40:01.940
I know you're not really asking
for advice.

40:02.108 --> 40:07.821
But let me hire 10, 15 more
good operators.

40:07.989 --> 40:10.741
Then we hit them hard.
Hit them where they live.

40:11.451 --> 40:15.496
No. This war stays cold for now.

40:19.876 --> 40:22.377
What about their message?
What's the answer?

40:26.132 --> 40:30.219
Set up a meeting.
Let's see what they have to say.

40:32.305 --> 40:34.306
How did he do today?

40:56.579 --> 40:58.872
I hear you can handle yourself.

41:00.125 --> 41:01.792
I guess.

41:02.710 --> 41:04.378
Good night.

41:04.963 --> 41:06.880
Hey, excuse me?

41:08.591 --> 41:10.467
Why me?

41:12.137 --> 41:15.097
I like to think I see things in people.

41:40.665 --> 41:45.085
Slow down.
The car is not going anywhere.

41:48.047 --> 41:51.508
- Mom.
- Hey, sweetheart.

41:51.676 --> 41:54.511
- Hi.
- Hey.

41:57.640 --> 42:00.976
- So did you see what's in the driveway?
- There you go.

42:01.769 --> 42:03.896
Yeah, I saw.

42:04.272 --> 42:05.939
Hey.

42:08.401 --> 42:10.194
So that's yours, huh?

42:10.361 --> 42:12.821
Yeah. Dad got it for me.

42:12.989 --> 42:15.324
Well, that was very nice of him.

42:16.034 --> 42:17.618
Yeah.

42:17.785 --> 42:20.954
I know it looks like...

42:21.456 --> 42:24.917
...well, awesome, but it's super safe.

42:25.084 --> 42:26.543
Dad made sure.

42:26.711 --> 42:30.047
And I promise
to always go the speed limit. Or below.

42:30.215 --> 42:31.381
Way below.

42:31.549 --> 42:36.136
And it gets great gas mileage.

42:37.513 --> 42:42.267
So Dad said I can take it around
the block a few times. That okay?

42:42.810 --> 42:44.895
Just around the block.

42:45.063 --> 42:48.106
Yeah. Just around the block.

42:48.650 --> 42:52.152
- And be careful, okay?
- I will.

42:52.987 --> 42:54.446
Bye.

42:57.116 --> 43:00.869
It's really... it's really great
to have you home, Mom.

43:08.211 --> 43:10.879
Hey, seriously, be careful. Okay?

43:11.047 --> 43:12.965
- I will.
- Okay.

43:30.817 --> 43:33.068
I guess we should talk.

43:33.653 --> 43:36.405
Well, I think you said plenty
the other day.

43:36.572 --> 43:40.450
Look, about that, it just...

43:41.077 --> 43:43.704
Did you get the car wash keys?

43:44.622 --> 43:48.500
Yes. Yes. Here.

43:54.924 --> 44:01.221
Skyler, I may have
overstated things earlier...

44:01.389 --> 44:05.559
...and I'm sorry to be so forward.

44:06.269 --> 44:10.063
But I just...
l want you to know something.

44:10.231 --> 44:11.898
I want you to...

44:12.066 --> 44:14.776
I need you to understand...

44:15.069 --> 44:17.154
...that you are safe.

44:17.322 --> 44:22.701
You, Junior, Holly.
You are completely safe.

44:24.037 --> 44:27.748
Everything that I do, everything...

44:27.915 --> 44:31.168
...I do it to protect this family.

44:32.628 --> 44:37.007
So buying that car,
that was protecting your family?

44:39.552 --> 44:42.346
Okay. I...

44:42.930 --> 44:47.267
All right, maybe it's a little flashy,
but he needed a car...

44:48.394 --> 44:52.564
...and I'm his father, and I should
be able to get what he wants.

44:55.485 --> 44:57.861
It goes back.

44:58.363 --> 44:59.613
Tomorrow.

45:00.114 --> 45:03.283
Skyler, it will crush him.

45:04.535 --> 45:08.372
That car directly contradicts
our story.

45:08.998 --> 45:12.084
And if you're so invested
in protecting this family...

45:12.251 --> 45:15.128
...it means protecting the story.

45:15.296 --> 45:18.215
What do you think the neighbors
are gonna say, Walt?

45:18.383 --> 45:19.925
What about Hank and Marie?

45:20.426 --> 45:24.012
How about the IRS?
What were you thinking, walt?

45:24.180 --> 45:28.975
I was thinking that I wanted
to do something nice for my son.

45:37.777 --> 45:39.361
Look.

45:41.489 --> 45:44.866
I just worry that he'll blame you
for this.

45:48.621 --> 45:50.372
Oh, he will.

45:50.873 --> 45:53.417
Once again,
he'll blame his bitch mother...

45:53.584 --> 45:57.546
...for taking away
what his loving father has given him...

45:58.131 --> 46:00.215
...so thanks for that.

46:02.677 --> 46:04.886
But you know what, Walt?

46:05.596 --> 46:07.639
Someone has to protect this family...

46:07.807 --> 46:11.101
...from the man
who protects this family.
