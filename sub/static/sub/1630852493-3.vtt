WEBVTT

00:05.744 --> 00:08.312
Life is hectic in my house.

00:08.356 --> 00:11.185
<i>Virtually every hour of my day</i> <i>
is scheduled,</i>

00:11.228 --> 00:13.752
<i>without a moment to lose.</i>

00:13.796 --> 00:17.017
<i>So every moment I'm standing</i> <i>
around is a moment wasted.</i>

00:17.060 --> 00:18.931
Guys, some on!
We've got to hustle!

00:18.975 --> 00:21.586
Jack, Diane, Devante,
let's go!

00:21.630 --> 00:23.066
Ready to go, big guy.

00:24.111 --> 00:25.286
Boy, not you.

00:25.329 --> 00:27.244
I'm talking about my son,
Devante.

00:27.288 --> 00:29.246
There are six Black kids
at his school.

00:29.290 --> 00:31.944
How did you end up tutoring the
only other kid named Devante?

00:31.988 --> 00:33.990
This is the one
I'm talking about. Let's roll.

00:34.034 --> 00:36.775
<i>That's why you can bet</i> <i>
I put a dollar value</i>

00:36.819 --> 00:38.777
<i>on every minute</i> <i>
of my free time.</i>

00:38.821 --> 00:39.822
Hey, Dad.
Hey.

00:39.865 --> 00:41.432
Olivia and I have
an extra ticket

00:41.476 --> 00:44.609
to an amazing cheese tasting.
Care to join us?

00:44.653 --> 00:47.612
It's all
Humboldt County goat cheeses.

00:50.746 --> 00:52.356
That's gonna be
a big fat "hell no."

00:52.400 --> 00:54.619
I'm not about to waste
$500 of my time

00:54.663 --> 00:57.274
to taste some nasty cheese
from a funky goat.

00:57.318 --> 01:00.234
Come on, old man,
expand your mind!

01:00.277 --> 01:01.496
No.

01:01.539 --> 01:04.194
Hey, good news, baby.
If you come with me

01:04.238 --> 01:07.067
to a one-hour timeshare
presentation,

01:07.110 --> 01:10.287
we get three nights free
in San Pedro!

01:10.331 --> 01:12.594
Come on,
go with me, baby!

01:14.335 --> 01:17.164
Mama, thank you,
but I'm good.

01:17.207 --> 01:20.254
Fine, I'll ask the White lady
next door.

01:20.297 --> 01:23.213
I bet she's dying to get some
vacation braids.

01:23.257 --> 01:25.259
Oh, my God!
We just got invited

01:25.302 --> 01:27.565
to the most incredible
charity event.

01:30.786 --> 01:32.483
Pass.
You owe me.

01:32.527 --> 01:33.484
What?

01:33.528 --> 01:34.964
Babe?
Yes?

01:35.007 --> 01:36.966
I know it's
your birthday weekend...
Yes.

01:37.009 --> 01:41.057
...but I got us tickets to
Clippers Fan Fest!

01:43.712 --> 01:46.715
Hyah!

01:46.758 --> 01:49.239
<i>Unfortunately,</i> <i>
I married someone</i>

01:49.283 --> 01:51.241
<i>whose time is also valuable.</i>

01:51.285 --> 01:52.242
<i>Damn.</i>

01:57.334 --> 01:59.684
Come on, Dre,
don't make that face.

01:59.728 --> 02:02.600
What? It's not like I invited
you to a timeshare presentation.

02:02.644 --> 02:04.646
This is an event
for a great cause.

02:04.689 --> 02:08.911
Look, "When We All Vote
works to change the culture

02:08.954 --> 02:11.218
around voting
and increase voter turnout

02:11.261 --> 02:13.829
by helping to close
the age and race gap

02:13.872 --> 02:15.047
at the polls."

02:15.091 --> 02:18.138
Plus, it says
there's a special guest.

02:18.181 --> 02:19.574
It's gonna be John Legend.

02:19.617 --> 02:20.923
It's always John Legend!

02:20.966 --> 02:23.055
Dre, this is a cause
that we both care about!

02:23.099 --> 02:24.709
And the Thompsons
might be there. Ah!

02:24.753 --> 02:27.190
Ugh, the Thompsons.

02:27.234 --> 02:30.106
What?! The Thompsons
are really nice people,

02:30.150 --> 02:32.456
and I think that if we spent
time with them,

02:32.500 --> 02:33.457
we would really click.

02:33.501 --> 02:34.545
No way.

02:34.589 --> 02:36.765
Alright?
No couple friends.
Why not?

02:36.808 --> 02:39.594
Because no one ever likes
each other equally.

02:39.637 --> 02:41.683
And I don't want to get stuck
making small talk

02:41.726 --> 02:43.250
with some dude
just nodding along,

02:43.293 --> 02:45.774
telling me about the 55 ways
to fix up an old canoe.

02:45.817 --> 02:47.254
That canoe
was really nice.

02:48.777 --> 02:49.821
Hey, guys!

02:49.865 --> 02:52.259
Don't forget,
tonight is movie night!

02:52.302 --> 02:53.608
And we are gonna find out

02:53.651 --> 02:56.045
what they are so
"Fast and Furious" about.

02:56.088 --> 02:58.265
Uh-huh.
I'm-a tell ya,
I think it's air pollution.

02:58.308 --> 02:59.744
Uh... Sorry,
we have plans.

02:59.788 --> 03:00.963
Yeah.
With who?

03:01.006 --> 03:02.269
Friends.

03:02.312 --> 03:03.095
Where?

03:03.139 --> 03:04.096
Out.

03:04.140 --> 03:05.446
Yo,
you hear this dude?

03:05.489 --> 03:07.274
Yeah. They're crazy.

03:07.317 --> 03:08.840
Don't wait up.

03:08.884 --> 03:10.190
Wow.

03:10.233 --> 03:11.539
- Okay.
- Alright.

03:11.582 --> 03:12.888
Well, you know what,
Dre?

03:12.931 --> 03:14.585
This is why
we need couple friends.

03:14.629 --> 03:17.284
Come on, we'll go there,
we'll meet some people.

03:17.327 --> 03:19.068
It's gonna be fun.

03:19.111 --> 03:20.112
Come on.
Go with me.

03:20.156 --> 03:21.244
Fine!
Yes!

03:21.288 --> 03:22.332
I'll go.

03:22.376 --> 03:23.942
But I'm wearing sneakers
with my suit,

03:23.986 --> 03:25.553
and I don't want to hear
a word about it.

03:25.596 --> 03:26.684
Fine.

03:26.728 --> 03:29.121
<i>Even though Bow's</i> <i>
adult play date</i>

03:29.165 --> 03:30.688
<i>wasn't until the weekend,</i>

03:30.732 --> 03:33.213
<i>I was already dreading hanging</i> <i>
out with other couples.</i>

03:33.256 --> 03:35.127
Okay, Dre,
what's going on?

03:35.171 --> 03:36.477
Oh, no, let me --
let me guess.

03:36.520 --> 03:40.220
Uh, the NFL has fired its only
Black head coach?

03:40.263 --> 03:41.395
No.
Oh.

03:41.438 --> 03:43.266
Bow is making me go to
this charity event

03:43.310 --> 03:45.790
because she thinks we need
couple friends.

03:45.834 --> 03:47.836
Who needs couple friends?

03:47.879 --> 03:51.013
I wish I had couple friends...
or really even any friends.

03:51.056 --> 03:53.537
Aw, couple friends are
a complete waste of time.

03:53.581 --> 03:55.757
Trust me. The woman always
falls in love with you,

03:55.800 --> 03:57.889
and the man
always wants a boat loan.

03:57.933 --> 03:59.413
If you don't want to go to
the charity event,

03:59.456 --> 04:02.416
I'll be happy to escort Bow.

04:02.459 --> 04:05.027
At the dinner table,
lookin' all fine.

04:05.070 --> 04:08.291
What's this?
Someone's passing around a bowl.

04:08.335 --> 04:10.685
Okay, I'll put my keys in.

04:10.728 --> 04:12.339
I'm a little unsure
at first.

04:12.382 --> 04:13.775
Rainbow is perfect.

04:13.818 --> 04:15.298
With so many
beautiful types of fruit,

04:15.342 --> 04:17.605
I'd be foolish to limit myself
to just one...

04:17.648 --> 04:20.303
Okay, Charlie,
- it's not that kind of party.
- Oh.

04:20.347 --> 04:22.566
Alright? These events
are always the same,

04:22.610 --> 04:24.307
with Bow trying to make us
be friends

04:24.351 --> 04:28.050
with interesting women
and their dud husbands.

04:28.093 --> 04:30.618
You know, so many journalists
and college professors.

04:30.661 --> 04:34.535
Never anything that's useful,
like a Formula 1 driver or --

04:34.578 --> 04:35.884
or a celebrity chef.

04:35.927 --> 04:39.366
Or a friendly D.A. who can
"lose" the paperwork

04:39.409 --> 04:41.933
when you're charged with
trafficking panda cubs.

04:41.977 --> 04:43.283
Exactly!

04:43.326 --> 04:45.197
Look, I don't mind
writing the check,

04:45.241 --> 04:48.636
but my whole night is ruined
when Bow does that stuff.

04:48.679 --> 04:50.072
Like, hell, I'd rather
go to

04:50.115 --> 04:51.900
Devante's kindergarten
drum recital.

04:51.943 --> 04:53.902
Hell, I'll take her
to the drum recital.

04:55.120 --> 04:57.253
Wait, someone's passing
a bowl around.

04:57.297 --> 04:58.646
What's this?

04:58.689 --> 05:00.300
They're swapping kids.

05:00.343 --> 05:02.432
Someone hands me a child.

05:02.476 --> 05:04.086
I guess he's mine now.

05:04.129 --> 05:05.392
Charlie?

05:05.435 --> 05:08.438
<i>I</i> will be taking my wife
to every event,

05:08.482 --> 05:11.963
including this one, even if it
is a total waste of time.

05:12.007 --> 05:13.617
But I will tell you this.

05:13.661 --> 05:15.576
I am playing hard to get.

05:15.619 --> 05:19.144
I will not be saddled
with a dud again.

05:20.015 --> 05:23.235
<i>I kept my word and went to</i> <i>
the charity event with Bow,</i>

05:23.279 --> 05:27.936
<i>and it was exactly what</i> <i>
I thought -- full of duds.</i>

05:27.979 --> 05:30.721
And we are so grateful that you
have joined us

05:30.765 --> 05:32.897
to support
When We All Vote.

05:32.941 --> 05:36.118
We're a nonpartisan initiative
that empowers people to vote,

05:36.161 --> 05:38.338
hold our elected officials
accountable,

05:38.381 --> 05:40.862
and protects the right
to cast a ballot.

05:40.905 --> 05:43.255
We need your help to build
an engaged electorate

05:43.299 --> 05:45.780
for today
and for generations to come.

05:45.823 --> 05:46.998
Yeah.

05:47.042 --> 05:48.913
Cheers. Thank you so much
for your support.

05:48.957 --> 05:50.175
Hey!
Wonderful.

05:50.219 --> 05:51.481
Thank you for having us.

05:51.525 --> 05:52.613
Hon?
Yes?

05:52.656 --> 05:54.789
Yeah, uh, we've been here
for an hour.

05:54.832 --> 05:56.138
Mm-hmm.
Can we put
these spinach puffs

05:56.181 --> 05:58.706
in our pockets
and break out of here?

05:58.749 --> 06:00.142
No, Dre, we cannot do that.

06:00.185 --> 06:01.752
Why?
Just --
Just be a nice person.

06:01.796 --> 06:03.145
Be a nice --Babe, let's break out.

06:04.581 --> 06:05.756
What?

06:05.800 --> 06:07.454
Isn't that -- Who is that?

06:11.371 --> 06:13.416
Sweet Black Jesus.

06:13.460 --> 06:15.026
- That's not John Legend.
- I know.

06:17.986 --> 06:21.206
Hey! What y'all lookin'
so happy about?

06:21.250 --> 06:23.295
Did you make my baby
take marijuana?

06:23.339 --> 06:25.820
What?! No,
we just, um...

06:25.863 --> 06:27.778
We met somebody special.

06:27.822 --> 06:29.737
Like, <i>special</i> special.

06:29.780 --> 06:31.042
They might not want to hear
- about who we met tonight.
- Oh, probably not.

06:31.086 --> 06:33.131
It was Michelle Obama!

06:33.175 --> 06:34.394
Michelle Obama?!

06:34.437 --> 06:36.134
Are you sure
it was really her?

06:36.178 --> 06:37.309
You'll been fooled

06:37.353 --> 06:39.137
by Barack Obama impersonators
before.

06:39.181 --> 06:41.052
Okay, he was pretending not to
be himself

06:41.096 --> 06:43.272
so he wouldn't draw a crowd,
fool.

06:43.315 --> 06:44.969
And we know it was her because
we connected

06:45.013 --> 06:46.536
like we've known each other
forever,

06:46.580 --> 06:50.105
and we had a conversation that
was about being parents...

06:50.148 --> 06:51.454
Mm-hmm.
...professionals...

06:51.498 --> 06:54.370
Yes....and honestly, it was --
what's the word?

06:54.414 --> 06:55.458
Oh...

06:55.502 --> 06:57.155
Magical.

06:57.199 --> 06:58.722
Hmm.

07:06.121 --> 07:09.559

07:09.603 --> 07:17.567

How do you know she feels
the same way about you?

07:46.596 --> 07:50.600
Yeah. This is the same boy
who thought he made eye contact

07:50.644 --> 07:52.602
with Janet
on the Rhythm Nation tour.

07:52.646 --> 07:54.038
- Yeah.
- And then he went back to school,

07:54.082 --> 07:55.736
telling everybody
that she was his girlfriend.

07:55.779 --> 07:57.781
She looked into my soul.

07:57.825 --> 08:02.438
We know because I got
Michelle Obama's phone number.

08:02.482 --> 08:05.920
And she will be joining us for
dinner here Saturday night.

08:05.963 --> 08:07.312
Ho-ho-ho-ho!
What?!

08:07.356 --> 08:08.879
Oh, my God,
- this is amazing!
They lyin'.

08:08.923 --> 08:11.534
I am gonna start workshopping
ideas on how to greet her.

08:11.578 --> 08:13.667
"Hello" does not
feel special enough.
It's not.

08:13.710 --> 08:15.277
She's not gonna
want to meet you

08:15.320 --> 08:18.062
when she can meet a genuine
Civil Rights hero.

08:18.106 --> 08:19.977
No one has told
any of you

08:20.021 --> 08:21.718
that you are welcome to
this dinner,

08:21.762 --> 08:23.938
so you have to
leave the house,

08:23.981 --> 08:26.288
because we want to
have a nice, normal dinner

08:26.331 --> 08:27.202
with our friends.

08:27.245 --> 08:28.159
You don't have
any friends.

08:28.203 --> 08:29.552
Right!
Oh, it feels so right!

08:29.596 --> 08:32.076
You aren't seriously
gonna leave us out?

08:32.120 --> 08:33.861
This is child abuse!

08:33.904 --> 08:37.647
Andre, your giant head tore me
from tip to tail.

08:37.691 --> 08:40.563
Now, you could at least let me
say hello to the woman!

08:40.607 --> 08:44.088
Sorry, everybody must leave
Saturday night,

08:44.132 --> 08:46.351
and that goes for
you guys, too.

08:46.395 --> 08:48.571
Okay, cool. Mason's having
a black-light party,

08:48.615 --> 08:50.617
so we really don't care about
what you guys have going on.

08:50.660 --> 08:52.401
Michelle Obama
is coming to dinner.

08:52.444 --> 08:53.620
- What?!
- What?

08:53.663 --> 08:57.101
Oh, I, uh...
Dang, Mason's party

08:57.145 --> 08:58.842
was just canceled, yeah.

08:58.886 --> 09:00.801
- He has a seven-day diarrhea.
- Mm.

09:00.844 --> 09:04.587
So, um, we are actually
available to meet Mrs. O.

09:04.631 --> 09:07.416
All of you
are banned, okay?

09:07.459 --> 09:09.592
Because this --

09:09.636 --> 09:11.899
this is something
that's just for Dre and I.

09:11.942 --> 09:13.335
- Yes.
- Mmm.

09:15.163 --> 09:16.077
No.

09:17.165 --> 09:19.994
"No" is right.
Ain't nobody --

09:20.037 --> 09:21.299
Alright, alright!

09:21.343 --> 09:23.258
Hold on, hold on!

09:23.301 --> 09:26.261
We understand and appreciate
all that you do for us.

09:26.304 --> 09:28.611
And if you want this evening to
yourselves,

09:28.655 --> 09:30.831
we will honor your request.

09:30.874 --> 09:34.312
I neither understand or
appreciate what Rainbow and Dre

09:34.356 --> 09:38.403
are trying to do, nor do I feel
any need to honor their request.

09:38.447 --> 09:40.405
This is madness.

09:40.449 --> 09:43.321
- I agree!
- We have a Black Jesus given right

09:43.365 --> 09:44.540
to meet this woman!

09:44.584 --> 09:47.195
Now, y'all know --
y'all know how I feel

09:47.238 --> 09:49.240
about somebody from the
government comin' in this house.

09:49.284 --> 09:50.677
- Yeah.
- Right.

09:50.720 --> 09:51.982
But we talkin' about
Mrs. Michelle Obama. Come on!

09:52.026 --> 09:53.462
Michelle Obama!

09:53.505 --> 09:54.463
It's only right.

09:54.506 --> 09:56.117
And who do
they think they are?

09:56.160 --> 09:57.771
Exactly,
we're the teenagers.

09:57.814 --> 09:59.250
We're the ones supposed to be
ditching them,

09:59.294 --> 10:00.643
- not the other way around.
- Right.

10:00.687 --> 10:03.646
And it's not like I even want to
hang out for long.

10:03.690 --> 10:06.997
I just want one photo that I can
rub in the faces of my enemies!

10:07.041 --> 10:09.217
Yeah, and I just want her to
sign my copy of "Becoming"

10:09.260 --> 10:10.522
and tell me I'm enough.

10:10.566 --> 10:12.350
I want to know if she still has
connections

10:12.394 --> 10:15.919
who can look into pardoning
certain youthful indiscretions

10:15.963 --> 10:19.053
from the 1960s so someone
can get a passport again.

10:19.096 --> 10:19.880
You feel me?

10:19.923 --> 10:21.664
- Ah.
- Ah, I feel you.

10:21.708 --> 10:22.970
Alright, alright, alright!

10:23.013 --> 10:25.276
Then it's decided.

10:25.320 --> 10:27.931
We're gonna crash
this party.

10:27.975 --> 10:29.019
Huh?

10:29.063 --> 10:32.806
Jack, go get me
my disguise trunk.

10:32.849 --> 10:34.416
Go ahead.

10:34.459 --> 10:37.462
<i>The night of the dinner,</i> <i>
everything was in place</i>

10:37.506 --> 10:41.162
<i>to welcome Michelle Obama</i> <i>
into our humble home.</i>

10:41.205 --> 10:42.859
Babe, do you know what's weird
about this?

10:42.903 --> 10:45.209
- What?
- Is how not-weird it feels.

10:45.253 --> 10:46.254
I know, right?

10:46.297 --> 10:47.734
Mrs. Obama is just so warm
and --

10:47.777 --> 10:49.300
and down-to-earth.
Mm-hmm.

10:49.344 --> 10:51.128
Do you know that I sent her
a confirmation text,

10:51.172 --> 10:54.131
and she sent me back
a dancing-lady emoji.

10:54.175 --> 10:55.655
That's it?
No words?

10:55.698 --> 10:56.699
It was just like, "Wah!"

10:56.743 --> 10:57.787
She's cool.

10:57.831 --> 10:58.919
Oh, okay, okay!

10:58.962 --> 11:00.703
Okay, baby!
Baby, button my arm button!

11:00.747 --> 11:01.878
Uh...

11:01.922 --> 11:03.575
- Okay, I'm gonna button.
- Button, okay.

11:03.619 --> 11:05.273
Okay. Okay, come on.
Come one, give it to me.

11:05.316 --> 11:07.014
Oh! Mmm!

11:07.057 --> 11:07.971
Okay.
Okay, okay.

11:10.713 --> 11:11.932
Okay, hey.

11:11.975 --> 11:13.890
Hi. I thought I would do
the neighborly thing

11:13.934 --> 11:15.152
on a Saturday night
and bring over

11:15.196 --> 11:17.677
my famous
tuna-zoodle casserole.

11:17.720 --> 11:18.503
Can I come in, please?

11:18.547 --> 11:19.635
- No.
- No!

11:19.679 --> 11:20.854
Alright, look,
I put 2 and 2 together

11:20.897 --> 11:22.377
when the Secret Service
interviewed me.

11:22.420 --> 11:24.335
I know Mrs. Obama is gonna be
here. I just want to meet her.

11:24.379 --> 11:25.641
No.
I can pretend
to be your maid.

11:25.685 --> 11:27.121
- Uh, uh, good night.
- A white maid!

11:27.164 --> 11:29.427
I mean, wouldn't that be
something?

11:29.471 --> 11:31.255
<i>Everyone else may have been</i> <i>
tripping,</i>

11:31.299 --> 11:33.910
<i>but we just wanted to have</i> <i>
a normal night.</i>

11:33.954 --> 11:35.825
<i>Luckily, so did Mrs. Obama.</i>

11:35.869 --> 11:37.827
I hope this is okay.

11:37.871 --> 11:39.263
Mm-hmm, looks good,
looks good.

11:39.307 --> 11:40.395
Uh-huh.

11:40.438 --> 11:41.918
Well, you know,
we figured

11:41.962 --> 11:44.051
that you've had enough
steak dinners for a lifetime.

11:44.094 --> 11:45.530
How'd you know?

11:45.574 --> 11:46.575
Oh.

11:46.618 --> 11:47.402
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

11:48.708 --> 11:49.926
Don't mind us.
Sorry, just --

11:49.970 --> 11:51.536
Oh -- forgot my phone
in here.

11:51.580 --> 11:52.581
Hi.
We'll be real quick.

11:52.624 --> 11:54.757
Take the picture.

11:54.801 --> 11:58.413
For the love of God, Olivia,
take the picture.

11:58.456 --> 11:59.370
Junior?

11:59.414 --> 12:00.371
Yes?

12:00.415 --> 12:01.372
Get out.

12:01.416 --> 12:02.547
Oh, sorry, Father.

12:02.591 --> 12:03.940
- Thank you.
- Bow, what is he doing here?

12:03.984 --> 12:04.898
I have no idea.

12:04.941 --> 12:07.639
Weird, right?
Zoey?

12:07.683 --> 12:08.640
Yeah?

12:08.684 --> 12:10.425
What are you doing here?

12:10.468 --> 12:11.774
Are you kidding?
No.

12:11.818 --> 12:13.907
I'm here all the time.

12:13.950 --> 12:17.301
And matter of fact, I actually
just started a fashion line.

12:17.345 --> 12:19.260
Oh.
So if you wanna give me

12:19.303 --> 12:20.609
Sasha and Malia's sizes...

12:20.652 --> 12:22.089
Oh.
...I'll send you
some samples.

12:22.132 --> 12:23.090
Hey.
Okay.

12:23.133 --> 12:24.526
Hey, Zoey, nice try.

12:24.569 --> 12:25.701
Get out.
Get out.

12:25.745 --> 12:26.920
Congratulations.
- Aw, thank you.

12:26.963 --> 12:28.051
Oh, she's a cutie.

12:28.095 --> 12:28.835
She doesn't live here.

12:28.878 --> 12:29.661
She doesn't live here?

12:29.705 --> 12:30.662
Yeah.
Really?

12:30.706 --> 12:32.490
Seriously.
Andre, my boy.

12:32.534 --> 12:33.753
No.
Oh.

12:33.796 --> 12:34.928
I'll not have you speak thus

12:34.971 --> 12:36.190
when we have such
august company about.

12:36.233 --> 12:37.104
Oh, boy.

12:37.147 --> 12:38.453
- "August"?
- What does that mean?

12:38.496 --> 12:39.454
Good evening, your grace.

12:39.497 --> 12:40.498
Good evening.

12:40.542 --> 12:42.109
My deepest apologies
for my son.

12:42.152 --> 12:43.806
I'm still working
on his refinement.

12:43.850 --> 12:45.721
Oh.
A father's work
is never done.

12:47.070 --> 12:50.073
I-I-Indeed,
guv'nor, indeed.

12:50.117 --> 12:51.596
I'm sorry.

12:51.640 --> 12:54.034
- I just love you so much!
- Oh.

12:54.077 --> 12:56.471
You did so much to normalize

12:56.514 --> 12:57.951
having your mother
live with you.

12:57.994 --> 12:59.387
Okay.

12:59.430 --> 13:01.084
So, Mama, enough!

13:01.128 --> 13:04.044
Alright, if your name
is not on the mortgage

13:04.087 --> 13:07.047
and your ass has never lived at
the White House, get out.

13:07.090 --> 13:08.831
- Okay.
- Great to meet you.

13:08.875 --> 13:09.832
Michelle Obama.

13:09.876 --> 13:10.833
- Thank you, thank you.
- Thank you.

13:10.877 --> 13:12.269
Greetings to the first man.

13:12.313 --> 13:13.270
How did her arms feel,
baby?

13:13.314 --> 13:14.794
Hey.
- Hard -- very hard.

13:14.837 --> 13:17.013
- Wow, wow.
- Okay, I'm so sorry.

13:17.057 --> 13:18.449
Oh, my -- I'm...
Beautiful.

13:18.493 --> 13:20.190
- Yes, that -- Okay.
- Wow, lovely gown.

13:20.234 --> 13:21.365
That was a lot.

13:21.409 --> 13:23.628
Yeah, I'm so sorry.

13:23.672 --> 13:26.109
- Oh, my God.
- My apologies.

13:26.153 --> 13:29.069
Oh, trust me,
I have seen much worse.

13:29.112 --> 13:31.027
- Oh.
- And your family is beautiful.

13:31.071 --> 13:32.376
- Oh, thank you.
- They really are.

13:32.420 --> 13:34.770
Thank you, but that wasn't
the entire gang.

13:34.814 --> 13:36.119
Oh, there's more?

13:36.163 --> 13:38.121
Uh, I'm surprised the twins
haven't army-crawled

13:38.165 --> 13:39.427
- their way in here by now.
- Twins?

13:39.470 --> 13:40.558
- Hey, guys.
- Hey.

13:40.602 --> 13:41.385
What y'all eatin'?

13:41.429 --> 13:42.647
Hey, hi.

13:42.691 --> 13:44.127
- Hi.
- Who that lady? Hey.

13:44.171 --> 13:46.477
Yeah, anyway, we thought this
would be a great time...

13:46.521 --> 13:47.783
Mm.
...for movie night.

13:47.827 --> 13:49.829
- Movie night?
- Uh, I don't know your plans,

13:49.872 --> 13:51.352
but, uh, you're more than
welcome to stay.

13:51.395 --> 13:53.136
- Aww, thank you.
- We got sheets and pillows.

13:53.180 --> 13:55.356
This is incredible.

13:55.399 --> 13:57.880
If I don't see cartoon smoke
in 3 seconds

13:57.924 --> 13:59.142
where your bodies are,

13:59.186 --> 14:00.840
I will not be paying
for your college.

14:00.883 --> 14:02.798
- Oh.
- Get out.

14:02.842 --> 14:04.365
Get out now. Go.

14:04.408 --> 14:05.975
I'm-a -- I will --Go.

14:06.019 --> 14:07.716
Bye.
Get out. Goodb--

14:09.326 --> 14:10.893
- Wow.
- Oh, it's so cute.

14:10.937 --> 14:12.764
Well, I can tell you that that
was definitely just for you.

14:12.808 --> 14:13.940
Yes.

14:13.983 --> 14:15.506
That was for you because
Jack and Diane...

14:15.550 --> 14:17.291
Mm-hmm.
...they're in
that teenage phase...

14:17.334 --> 14:19.075
Oh....where they never want to be
anywhere near their family.

14:19.119 --> 14:20.076
- Hmm.
- Mm-hmm.

14:20.120 --> 14:21.077
- Like, ever.
- I-I get it.

14:21.121 --> 14:22.731
When our girls
were that age,

14:22.774 --> 14:24.820
you should have seen how
they rolled their eyes,

14:24.864 --> 14:26.604
- especially at their father.
- Really?

14:26.648 --> 14:27.736
Yeah. Oh, yeah.

14:27.779 --> 14:28.780
They roll their eyes
in front of my face.

14:28.824 --> 14:29.956
Well...
Oh.

14:29.999 --> 14:31.218
Alright? At least show me
the respect

14:31.261 --> 14:32.741
and roll your eyes
when my back is turned.

14:32.784 --> 14:34.612
Well,
that's the least they could do.

14:34.656 --> 14:35.657
- Mm-hmm.
- Oh, goodness.

14:35.700 --> 14:37.224
But it's all love,
it's all love.

14:37.267 --> 14:38.268
See, it's all love.
Thank you.

14:38.312 --> 14:39.269
That's what
we tell ourselves.

14:39.313 --> 14:40.705
Listen,
I will tell myself...

14:42.403 --> 14:43.491
I just thought it was so much
easier when they were younger.

14:43.534 --> 14:44.884
- Mm-hmm.
- Mm-hmm.

14:44.927 --> 14:46.146
Jack and Diane,
when they wouldn't go to sleep,

14:46.189 --> 14:47.495
I would do a little Jamaican
accent for them.

14:47.538 --> 14:48.713
- Oh, really?
- You know what I mean?

14:48.757 --> 14:49.627
And they would laugh and laugh
and laugh.

14:49.671 --> 14:50.802
And now when
I do it for them,

14:50.846 --> 14:51.934
they tell me
I'm canceled.

14:51.978 --> 14:52.979
Mm, mm-hmm.

14:53.022 --> 14:54.284
Well, I got to
hear this accent.

14:54.328 --> 14:56.025
- No.
- Come on, baby, you got to do it now.

14:56.069 --> 14:57.331
- Come on, do it, do it.
- Oh, come on.

14:57.374 --> 14:59.202
- Do it! Do it!
- Come on.

14:59.246 --> 15:00.203
- Do it!
- Come on.

15:01.291 --> 15:02.858
Okay, okay, okay.
Alright, ready?

15:02.902 --> 15:05.774
<i>Talking about life,</i> <i>
dissing our kids --</i>

15:05.817 --> 15:07.776
<i>it felt like this could be</i> <i>
the beginning</i>

15:07.819 --> 15:09.082
<i>of a beautiful friendship.</i>

15:11.998 --> 15:13.608
Everything went smooth tonight.
Sure did.

15:13.651 --> 15:15.044
Alright, tonight,
for the first time,

15:15.088 --> 15:16.393
I was able to be myself

15:16.437 --> 15:19.570
with a person who didn't share
my last name.

15:19.614 --> 15:21.616
Mm.

15:21.659 --> 15:23.574
Can you imagine...
Hmm?

15:23.618 --> 15:28.275
...if we actually become friends
with the Obamas?

15:28.318 --> 15:31.017
Oh. Summers in Hawaii,
pick-up basketball games,

15:31.060 --> 15:31.887
and guest spots on...
Oh.

15:31.931 --> 15:33.671
"Waffles + Mochi".

15:33.715 --> 15:35.282
Oh, babe,
we could talk about work,

15:35.325 --> 15:37.284
we could talk about family,
we could talk about life.

15:38.415 --> 15:39.590
We could go to the Grammys,
baby.

15:39.634 --> 15:40.852
Oh, my God,
I love the Grammys.

15:40.896 --> 15:41.853
I could get to
this life.
What would I wear?

15:41.897 --> 15:42.767
I could get used to
this life.

15:42.811 --> 15:44.204
Absolutely.

15:44.247 --> 15:45.640
Wait, she said she wanted to
do this again.

15:45.683 --> 15:47.033
Should I maybe
send her a text?
Yes.

15:47.076 --> 15:48.773
- Or else -- Right?
- No, no, baby,

15:48.817 --> 15:51.211
after the first date, I'd
normally wait five or six days.

15:51.254 --> 15:53.039
Well, that's not... But, you know, I --

15:53.082 --> 15:54.605
I rarely had second dates.

15:54.649 --> 15:56.042
Okay, well,
maybe just a quick note.

15:56.085 --> 15:58.044
I don't know, something
no-pressure, like, breezy.

15:58.087 --> 15:59.480
Uh, oh, hey,
I like breezy.

15:59.523 --> 16:00.742
You like bree--
- Okay, okay, okay.
- Yeah, mm-hmm.

16:00.785 --> 16:03.571
Um, "Thanks for coming.

16:03.614 --> 16:08.010
We had a really nice night."

16:08.054 --> 16:09.359
- Should I send it?
- Yeah, send it.

16:09.403 --> 16:10.143
Okay.
Mm-hmm.

16:11.144 --> 16:12.058
Oh, my God.
We got bubbles.

16:12.101 --> 16:13.102
- Damn, she's quick. OK.
- I know.

16:13.146 --> 16:14.625
"I had a really nice night,
too."

16:14.669 --> 16:15.931
Oh!
Okay.

16:15.975 --> 16:17.367
- Oh, that's so nice!
- Oh, let me see something.

16:17.411 --> 16:20.588
Um, okay, "When should we do it
again?"
That's good.

16:20.631 --> 16:22.807
"Maybe BO44 wants to join."

16:22.851 --> 16:23.852
Yeah, put it in there
right now.

16:23.895 --> 16:24.984
Why not? Hey.
I mean, you know,

16:25.027 --> 16:26.028
man, I'm trying to
make me a friend.

16:26.072 --> 16:27.551
Oh, God!
Oh!

16:27.595 --> 16:28.422
Wow, she does not let
a text sit.
Okay, okay, maybe.

16:28.465 --> 16:29.423
Look,
there's the bubbles.

16:29.466 --> 16:30.424
- Uh-huh.
- Okay.

16:30.467 --> 16:31.642
"Why don't you and I
set a date?"

16:31.686 --> 16:32.643
- Alright.
- Oh, God.

16:32.687 --> 16:33.862
- Yeah.
- Um...

16:33.905 --> 16:36.169
"I'm not sure about Barack."Oh.

16:36.212 --> 16:37.779
"He's just --
He's so busy.

16:37.822 --> 16:39.955
He's so busy working
on his next book."

16:39.999 --> 16:41.522
Yeah.
She mentioned that.

16:41.565 --> 16:43.393
- Mm-hmm. Yeah.
- Yeah.

16:43.437 --> 16:44.960
- I'm sorry, babe.
- It's okay, babe.

16:48.964 --> 16:50.009
Oh, my God.

16:50.661 --> 16:52.315
What?

16:52.359 --> 16:54.187
I'm the dud.

16:57.581 --> 16:59.931
<i>I'm used to being</i> <i>
the life of the party,</i>

16:59.975 --> 17:01.585
<i>so it took me a minute</i> <i>
to digest the fact</i>

17:01.629 --> 17:03.805
<i>that I received</i> <i>
the Presidential Medal</i>

17:03.848 --> 17:05.415
<i>of being the dud.</i>

17:05.459 --> 17:06.416
You okay?

17:06.460 --> 17:07.809
Nah, I'm good, babe.

17:07.852 --> 17:10.029
You know, I don't need to be
friends with the Obamas.

17:10.072 --> 17:11.769
I can learn how to windsurf
on my own.

17:11.813 --> 17:12.944
I know it's hurtful,
Dre,

17:12.988 --> 17:14.990
but you can't take it
personally.

17:15.034 --> 17:17.079
They're such busy people.

17:17.123 --> 17:19.516
I mean, they have to make tough
choices about their time.

17:19.560 --> 17:20.952
She wanted to
hang out with you.

17:20.996 --> 17:23.346
Well, uh, I'm amazing.

17:24.521 --> 17:26.436
But if we can't hang out
as a couple,

17:26.480 --> 17:28.917
then I don't need to hang out
with Michelle Obama.

17:29.874 --> 17:30.962
We're a package.

17:31.006 --> 17:32.312
Aww.

17:33.791 --> 17:35.489
- Thanks, babe.
- Mm-hmm.

17:35.532 --> 17:38.840
You know, I guess
I let myself kinda like

17:38.883 --> 17:40.755
the idea of having
couple friends.

17:40.798 --> 17:43.149
- Mm.
- But not just couple friends.

17:43.192 --> 17:44.715
Black couple friends.

17:44.759 --> 17:47.196
Babe, it seemed as if
she got us.

17:47.240 --> 17:49.981
You know, I didn't realize
how much it takes out of me

17:50.025 --> 17:54.116
when we're always unicorns
in social situations.

17:54.160 --> 17:55.770
Right.

17:55.813 --> 17:57.511
It's like we're always
crashing the party.

17:57.554 --> 17:59.600
Mm.
But not tonight.

17:59.643 --> 18:03.430
No.
We had a shared language.

18:03.473 --> 18:04.953
We didn't have to explain
ourselves.

18:04.996 --> 18:06.737
It felt --
It felt so good.

18:06.781 --> 18:08.304
Yeah.
So normal.

18:08.348 --> 18:11.133
What does it say about us
that we were more comfortable

18:11.177 --> 18:13.831
with the first lady than
the parents at school?

18:13.875 --> 18:17.792
Well...

18:17.835 --> 18:19.620
that between work...

18:19.663 --> 18:21.535
and school...
Mm-hmm.

18:21.578 --> 18:26.235
...we are not getting as many of
these nights as we want...

18:26.279 --> 18:28.019
and need.

18:28.063 --> 18:29.717
We need to find
our people.

18:29.760 --> 18:30.892
Yeah.

18:30.935 --> 18:33.155
Maybe we're looking
in the wrong places.

18:33.199 --> 18:34.678
Mm.

18:34.722 --> 18:36.158
You know what, babe?
Hmm?

18:36.202 --> 18:39.857
If you want, you can still
hang out with Michelle Obama.

18:39.901 --> 18:41.511
Oh, I was never not going to,
honey.

18:41.555 --> 18:43.774
Trust me, I know.

18:43.818 --> 18:45.211
I know.

18:45.254 --> 18:47.474
Undoubtedly,
a fine Courvoisier.

18:49.215 --> 18:52.435
It tickles
me throat and warms me liver.

18:52.479 --> 18:54.220
Uh, what's going on?

18:54.263 --> 18:55.525
They have dementia.

18:55.569 --> 18:57.136
No, no.
Look, we're celebratin'.

18:57.179 --> 18:59.964
We made a real connection with
Michelle Obama, didn't we?

19:00.008 --> 19:02.315
Michelle Obama!
Hey!

19:02.358 --> 19:04.360
I just can't believe Mom and Dad
kicked us out like that.

19:04.404 --> 19:06.493
This is the type of thing kids
write tell-all books about.

19:06.536 --> 19:07.624
Yeah.

19:07.668 --> 19:08.625
Hey, hey, hey, hey,
y'all sit down.

19:08.669 --> 19:09.931
Sit down, sit down.

19:09.974 --> 19:12.151
Come here.

19:14.631 --> 19:17.112
You sound like a real jerk.

19:17.156 --> 19:18.069
Grandma!

19:18.113 --> 19:19.462
I'm sorry, baby.

19:19.506 --> 19:23.031
Now, I know, as teenagers,
y'all feel like

19:23.074 --> 19:24.424
y'all should get
whatever y'all want,

19:24.467 --> 19:25.947
whenever y'all want it.

19:25.990 --> 19:29.603
But you don't get to
pick and choose

19:29.646 --> 19:31.213
when you want to
have a family.

19:31.257 --> 19:33.911
You think your parents will
always be at your beck and call?

19:33.955 --> 19:35.783
The real world
don't work that way.

19:35.826 --> 19:36.958
Thank you.

19:37.001 --> 19:38.264
Wow.

19:38.307 --> 19:39.569
With all the smack you talk,
we sort of figured

19:39.613 --> 19:41.136
you'd be on our side.

19:41.180 --> 19:45.184
Bottom line -- you can't act
like fools without consequences.

19:45.227 --> 19:46.489
Hmm.

19:48.143 --> 19:50.928
I mean, hey, at least we had fun
at Mason's party.

19:50.972 --> 19:52.103
No, we didn't.

19:54.845 --> 19:59.241
You tellin' me Michelle Obama
liked this excuse for a crumble?

19:59.285 --> 20:02.418
Ha-ha!
That woman lied to you.

20:02.462 --> 20:05.552
Hey, guys.
Uh, we were thinkin' --

20:05.595 --> 20:06.727
y'all down for movie night?

20:06.770 --> 20:08.163
- What?
- What's going on right now?

20:08.207 --> 20:09.512
Uh...

20:09.556 --> 20:11.079
Who do you guys think is in
the house, Cardi B?

20:11.122 --> 20:12.211
No.

20:12.254 --> 20:14.604
We thought about it,
and even though

20:14.648 --> 20:16.084
there are
no special guests,

20:16.127 --> 20:17.694
we still want to
hang out with you.

20:17.738 --> 20:18.956
- Really?
- Oh.

20:19.000 --> 20:20.784
Wow. Oh, okay.
Well, uh, you know what?

20:20.828 --> 20:22.264
Let me get
this movie cued up.

20:23.222 --> 20:25.006
<i>I'm not gonna lie,</i>

20:25.049 --> 20:28.270
<i>it's hard, not being able to</i> <i>
make new friends.</i>

20:28.314 --> 20:31.360
<i>And maybe I wasn't going to be</i> <i>
able to hang out</i>

20:31.404 --> 20:34.755
<i>with the first Black president</i> <i>
and his beautiful family.</i>

20:34.798 --> 20:37.932
<i>But at least I had my own</i> <i>
built-in first family</i>

20:37.975 --> 20:40.500
<i>to hang with,</i> <i>
and that's priceless.</i>

20:43.372 --> 20:45.113
Baby?
Yes, babe?

20:45.156 --> 20:46.767
What do you think for dinner?
Thai or sushi?

20:46.810 --> 20:48.116
Oh.

20:48.159 --> 20:49.335
I forgot to tell you.

20:49.378 --> 20:50.814
You're on your own tonight.
I have plans.

20:50.858 --> 20:52.251
- Hmm.
- With...

20:52.294 --> 20:54.949
Dwyane Wade
and Gabrielle Union.

20:54.992 --> 20:56.080
Where'd you meet them?

20:56.124 --> 20:58.866
Oh, you know, just,
uh -- just out.

20:58.909 --> 21:01.782
Mm-hmm. Nice.
What'd you guys talk about?

21:01.825 --> 21:03.436
Oh, you know,
the u-usual stuff.

21:03.479 --> 21:04.915
Oh.
You know, uh, the kids,

21:04.959 --> 21:07.614
fashion, uh,
how the game ain't changed.

21:07.657 --> 21:09.180
Oh.
A-As a matter of fact,

21:09.224 --> 21:10.965
I'm gonna go meet them
at the county fair.

21:11.008 --> 21:12.183
Oh, the fair.

21:12.227 --> 21:14.534
The entire county
is going to be there.

21:14.577 --> 21:16.100
Mm.
Everyone except for you,
of course.

21:16.144 --> 21:18.015
- Mm-hmm.
- Yeah.

21:18.059 --> 21:19.321
Oh, Dre.

21:20.714 --> 21:22.585
Oh.

21:24.805 --> 21:26.459
Damn it.

21:26.502 --> 21:28.330
Knew I should've went with
Will and Jada.
