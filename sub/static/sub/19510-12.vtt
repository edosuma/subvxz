ATTRACTIVE.

20:07.407 --> 20:09.779
NO. NOT REALLY.

20:09.779 --> 20:11.241
YOU KNOW, BUT IF
IT'S ANY CONSOLATION,

20:11.241 --> 20:13.883
I THINK IT HAS MORE TO DO
WITH YOUR CHOICE OF SHIRTS.

20:13.883 --> 20:15.845
ALL RIGHT,
FAIR ENOUGH.

20:15.845 --> 20:17.647
YEAH. A LITTLE FRUMPY.

20:17.647 --> 20:18.788
OK.

20:18.788 --> 20:21.351
UH...

20:21.351 --> 20:22.822
DID NINA
HAPPEN TO MENTION

20:22.822 --> 20:25.725
THAT I CAN LOOK LIKE
WHATEVER I WANT?

20:25.725 --> 20:27.757
WHAT?
I'M A DEMON, MAN.

20:27.757 --> 20:28.798
THIS WHOLE APPEARANCE,

20:28.798 --> 20:30.860
IT'S JUST A CONSTRUCT
OF MY MAKING.

20:30.860 --> 20:31.731
I THOUGHT YOU KNEW THAT.

20:31.731 --> 20:34.003
I CAN LOOK LIKE
ANGELINA JOLIE
IF I WANTED TO.

20:34.003 --> 20:35.865
AHH! AND YOU CHOSE
TO LOOK LIKE THAT.

20:35.865 --> 20:40.370

20:44.914 --> 20:47.577
HOW WOULD THIS WORK?
I MEAN, WOULD I GIVE
YOU A PICTURE

20:47.577 --> 20:48.848
OF LIKE MY DREAM GIRL

20:48.848 --> 20:51.421
AND YOU WOULD
SNAP YOUR FINGERS,
TURN INTO IT?

20:51.421 --> 20:53.623
WELL, IT'S MORE
COMPLICATED THAN THAT,

20:53.623 --> 20:54.824
BUT YES.

20:54.824 --> 20:57.427
WOW, THAT IS BIG NEWS
FOR ME.

20:57.427 --> 20:58.358
UH-HUH.
THIS IS MAJOR.

20:58.358 --> 20:59.829

LET--WHY DON'T WE

20:59.829 --> 21:01.030

21:10.600 --> 21:12.672
THAT IS A--THAT'S
A REALLY BIG QUESTION.

21:12.672 --> 21:14.574
HANG ON,
LET ME LOOK AT YOU.

21:14.574 --> 21:16.406
OH, THIS IS NOT
SOMETHING ONE WANTS

21:16.406 --> 21:18.878
TO MAKE A SNAP
DECISION ABOUT,
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

21:18.878 --> 21:19.709
IT'S, UH,

21:19.709 --> 21:21.881
IT'LL REQUIRE SOME
RESEARCH, PLANNING,

21:21.881 --> 21:23.913
A LITTLE MEDITATION.

21:23.913 --> 21:24.814
GIVE ME LIKE

DO YOU HAVE ANYTHING
THAT ISN'T UNDERWATER?

22:09.459 --> 22:10.800
UM...

22:10.800 --> 22:14.003
I'M SORRY,
I THINK THEY ALL ARE.

22:14.003 --> 22:17.336
SO I HAVE NOTHING
AND THIS PITCH
IS IN 10 MINUTES!

22:53.943 --> 22:55.945
THE END.

22:55.945 --> 22:57.907

22:57.907 --> 23:00.980
I THINK THAT'S PHIL'S MODEL.

23:00.980 --> 23:01.681
NO.

23:01.681 --> 23:05.054
YES, BUT I MADE
CHANGES TO IT.

23:05.054 --> 23:06.756
VERY SUBSTANTIAL
CHANGES,

23:06.756 --> 23:10.019
LIKE HOW I CRUSHED
THIS PART A LITTLE.

23:10.019 --> 23:13.493
YOU STOLE PHIL'S MODEL.
THAT MUCH IS CLEAR.

23:13.493 --> 23:14.393
OK, LISTEN,
I CAN EXPLAIN.

23:14.393 --> 23:16.095

23:16.095 --> 23:18.698
YOU SAW HIS PROJECT,
YOU WANTED IT FOR YOURSELF.

23:18.698 --> 23:20.500
SO YOU LURED THE MAN
INTO YOUR OFFICE

23:20.500 --> 23:22.902
AND YOU TOSSED HIM
OUT OF THE 59th STORY WINDOW.

23:22.902 --> 23:24.874
MR. RANDALL, NO!
I'M IMPRESSED!

23:24.874 --> 23:26.606

I DON'T KNOW,
MAYBE I WAS

40:13.111 --> 40:16.114
PROJECTING
MY INSECURITIES
ONTO YOU.

40:16.114 --> 40:19.888
I--YEAH, I GET THAT.

40:19.888 --> 40:20.789
NO.

40:20.789 --> 40:23.091
IT MIGHT NOT LOOK LIKE IT
FROM WHERE YOU'RE STANDING,

40:23.091 --> 40:23.722
BUT...

40:23.722 --> 40:28.557
I AM DEFINITELY RIDDLED
WITH MY SHARE OF INSECURITIES.

40:28.557 --> 40:31.029
YOU'RE NOT THE ONLY
THAT GETS JUDGED

40:31.029 --> 40:32.200
FOR THE WAY THEY LOOK.

40:32.200 --> 40:34.132
I DIDN'T REALIZE THAT.

40:34.132 --> 40:36.004
WELL...

40:36.935 --> 40:38.637
HEY!
WUH-OH!

40:38.637 --> 40:41.810
I HAVE AN IDEA
TO HELP US GET OUT
OF THIS SITUATION.

40:41.810 --> 40:43.672
I'M LISTENING.
AHEM. OK, NOW, WHAT IF--

40:43.672 --> 40:45.674
AND THIS IS JUST OFF
THE TOP OF MY HEAD.

40:45.674 --> 40:46.575
WHAT IF...

40:46.575 --> 40:49.818
YOU GO AHEAD AND TURN INTO
MY DREAM WOMAN,

40:49.818 --> 40:52.020
AND THEN I FEEL BETTER
ABOUT MYSELF

40:52.020 --> 40:53.181
HAVING DATED HER,

40:53.181 --> 40:55.453
AND YOU WON'T HAVE
ANY INSECURITIES LEFT

40:55.453 --> 40:57.656
BECAUSE I WOULD BE
ALL OVER HER.

40:57.656 --> 41:02.561
A.K.A., THE BETTER LOOKING
VERSION OF YOU.

41:04.092 --> 41:07.465
YOU...YOU ARE AN IDIOT.

41:07.465 --> 41:09.237
OH! THAT--LISTEN--

41:09.237 --> 41:12.741
CAN I HAVE MY COLLAGE BACK?

41:13.672 --> 41:16.244
YOU KNOW,
I TRIED EVERYTHING.
I GOT IT WET,

41:16.244 --> 41:19.107
I PUT LEMON JUICE ON IT.
IF THERE'S ANYTHING
WRITTEN ON THIS PAPER,

41:19.107 --> 41:19.878
I CAN'T FIND IT.

41:19.878 --> 41:23.652
WELL, DID SAM'S DAD
SAY ANYTHING ELSE?

41:23.652 --> 41:24.753
ALL HE SAID WAS
THAT THIS WAS THE WAY

41:24.753 --> 41:26.655
TO GET THE DEVIL
INTO COMPETITION WITH SAM.

41:26.655 --> 41:27.886
I'M SO HAPPY
YOU'RE HOME,

41:27.886 --> 41:30.689
EVEN THOUGH YOU SMELL
LIKE EGG SALAD, STILL.

41:30.689 --> 41:33.091
DON'T NEED IT.
CHILDHOOD MEMORIES, RIGHT?

41:33.091 --> 41:34.222
WHOOO!

41:34.222 --> 41:37.526
OH, MY GOSH,
I'M SO STUPID.

41:37.526 --> 41:38.597
HERE, GIVE ME THIS.

41:38.597 --> 41:41.129
WHOA, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?!
WAIT, JUST WATCH IT!

41:41.129 --> 41:41.900
SEE?

41:41.900 --> 41:44.002
Sock: OH, MY GOD,
LOOK AT THAT.

41:44.002 --> 41:46.504
WHAT DOES IT MEAN?

41:46.504 --> 41:47.936
I DON'T KNOW.

41:47.936 --> 41:49.808
IT'S AN ANCIENT DEMON TEXT.

41:49.808 --> 41:52.781
IT'S WAY BEFORE MY TIME.

41:52.781 --> 41:53.912
WE GET THIS TRANSLATED,

41:53.912 --> 41:57.185
SAM GETS OUT OF HIS DEAL
WITH THE DEVIL.

41:57.185 --> 41:59.588
ALL RIGHT!
ALL RIGHT!

41:59.588 --> 42:01.920
YEAH!
