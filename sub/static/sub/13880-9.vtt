Uh-uh-uh, ooh.

Welcome to paradise.

00:09.037 --> 00:10.709
Now, leave all your worries

00:10.709 --> 00:14.822
and other TV shows behind, baby.

00:14.822 --> 00:16.661
It's time
for "Aqua TV Show Show."

00:16.661 --> 00:18.267
Frylock: "Aqua TV Show Show."

00:18.267 --> 00:19.437
Shake: "Aqua TV Show Show."

00:19.437 --> 00:20.508
Meatwad: "Aqua TV Show Show."

00:20.508 --> 00:22.347
I said "Aqua TV Show Show."

00:22.347 --> 00:23.584
Frylock: "Aqua TV Show Show."

00:23.584 --> 00:25.825
Shake: "Aqua TV Show Show."

00:25.825 --> 00:27.430

00:44.217 --> 00:47.527
Frylock: Well, look at you
all duded up. Where you going?

00:47.527 --> 00:49.634
Shake: A job interview.

00:49.634 --> 00:51.407
Frylock: You? Job?

00:51.407 --> 00:53.413
Shake: Yeah, me. Job.

00:53.413 --> 00:57.191
Senior V.P. In charge
of some viral-marketing scam.

00:57.191 --> 00:59.198
And they had
four dollar signs on the end,

00:59.198 --> 01:02.776
so I know I'll be
knocking down the big bucks.

01:02.776 --> 01:04.549
Frylock:
Sounds a little like a scam.

01:04.549 --> 01:06.287
Shake: I told you
it was a scam, dummy,

01:06.287 --> 01:08.060
and I'm gonna be
in charge of it.

01:08.060 --> 01:09.531
Frylock:
Just don't sign anything.

01:09.531 --> 01:12.574
Sign this and this
and this and all these.

01:12.574 --> 01:13.678
Flip them over. Sign the back.

01:13.678 --> 01:15.015
Stop reading them. Sign them.

01:15.015 --> 01:17.390
Shake: Absolutely
I'll sign off on these.

01:17.390 --> 01:19.597
And then I'm off on my vacay.

01:19.597 --> 01:21.202
Vacay? Oh, no.

01:21.202 --> 01:23.174
We need you to go
viral right away --

01:23.174 --> 01:24.814
get you out there
pressing the flesh,

01:24.814 --> 01:27.689
working the room, shaking hands,
and making friends.

01:27.689 --> 01:29.128
Does this job sound challenging,

01:29.128 --> 01:31.736
or are you gonna get
burned out like the last guy?

01:31.736 --> 01:33.073
Shake: No, no. Not me.

01:33.073 --> 01:35.614
I am committed
to whatever the hell it is

01:35.614 --> 01:37.354
that you people do around here.

01:37.354 --> 01:38.892
Then congratulations.

01:38.892 --> 01:40.865
Hey, let's eat
hamburgers to celebrate.

01:40.865 --> 01:43.138
Two rare hamburgers, please.

01:44.610 --> 01:46.449
Shake: You, uh...

01:46.449 --> 01:47.452
you talking to me?

01:47.452 --> 01:48.623
The hamburger chef.

01:48.623 --> 01:50.730
Press my intercom and order.

01:50.730 --> 01:51.934
Shake: What?
You wanted rare, right?

01:51.934 --> 01:53.706
- Rare.
- Shake: Okay, yes.

01:53.706 --> 01:55.879
One rare hamburger, please,

01:55.879 --> 01:57.652
and I would like
one medium rare.

01:57.652 --> 01:59.792
I think you want rare.

02:00.862 --> 02:01.999
Shake: Could I get
that in medium?

02:01.999 --> 02:03.237
I think you meant rare.

02:03.237 --> 02:05.309
Shake: For him,
of course. And for me,

02:05.309 --> 02:08.018
- I will have a medium --
- Rare.

02:08.018 --> 02:09.020
- Shake: Medium.
- Rare.

02:09.020 --> 02:10.493
- Shake: Medium.
- Rare.

02:10.493 --> 02:11.830
Shake: Uh...

02:13.235 --> 02:14.907
- ...medium.
- Rare! Rare! Rare!

02:14.907 --> 02:16.211
- You want this job, don't you?!

02:16.211 --> 02:17.984
Shake: Rare. Uh, yeah.
Rare. Absolutely.

02:17.984 --> 02:20.826
Then order two rare hamburgers!

02:20.826 --> 02:23.267
- Shake: Oh, god!
- Don't you say a thing.

02:23.267 --> 02:25.341
We all have our
problems and disorders.

02:25.341 --> 02:27.615
How would you like it if I
pointed out some of yours, huh?

02:27.615 --> 02:31.059
We strive to create a
discrimination-free workplace,

02:31.059 --> 02:33.299
and you crapped it up,
you retard!

02:33.299 --> 02:34.838
Shake: Oh, okay.
No, I'm sorry.

02:34.838 --> 02:36.042
I am so sorry.

02:36.042 --> 02:37.680
Good. Now, go
and get our hamburgers,

02:37.680 --> 02:39.085
because the hamburger chef...

02:39.085 --> 02:41.425
well, he's just an eyeball.
He can't hold stuff.

02:41.425 --> 02:43.900
And don't you say crap to him,
either, 'cause he knows it.

02:43.900 --> 02:45.071
Shake: Okay.

02:45.071 --> 02:47.545
- Oh, god.
- Now, peel off the plastic

02:47.545 --> 02:49.686
and eat the raw meat
right in front of me,

02:49.686 --> 02:51.023
using the fork from the floor.

02:51.023 --> 02:52.460
Yeah, there you go. You got it.

02:52.460 --> 02:54.032
Wait a second.
Have you washed your hands?

02:54.032 --> 02:55.972
- Shake: No, of course not.
- Good, good.

02:55.972 --> 02:57.611
Now, on to phoenix.

02:57.611 --> 02:59.818
We're speaking at a conference.

02:59.818 --> 03:01.155
Shake: You know,
I didn't really realize

03:01.155 --> 03:03.630
I was gonna have to keep
you in my carry-on luggage.

03:03.630 --> 03:05.101
I am not buying another ticket,

03:05.101 --> 03:08.010
but I will not be stored
under the seat in front of you.

03:08.010 --> 03:09.148
Shake: Just calm down,
all right?

03:09.148 --> 03:10.151
People put boogers under there.

03:10.151 --> 03:11.154
Shake: Calm down.

03:11.154 --> 03:12.559
I'm considered head and arms,

03:12.559 --> 03:14.465
but not one airline
will recognize that.

03:14.465 --> 03:15.970
Shake: You're drawing
attention to yourself.

03:15.970 --> 03:17.140
I don't give a damn!

03:17.140 --> 03:18.110
They shoved me through the x-ray

03:18.110 --> 03:19.447
like a pair of penny loafers.

03:19.447 --> 03:22.557
- Shake: All right, so --
- I am a man.

03:22.557 --> 03:24.999
Shake: Okay, so,
I wrote a couple jokes

03:24.999 --> 03:26.737
to ease it into
whatever the hell it is

03:26.737 --> 03:28.209
I'm supposed to talk about.

03:28.209 --> 03:31.185
I got -- okay, a polack
and a jew walk into a brothel --

03:31.185 --> 03:32.623
That -- that sounds hilarious.

03:32.623 --> 03:34.462
Here, dip your hand
in this unpasteurized milk.

03:34.462 --> 03:35.833
Shake:
Those two races of people

03:35.833 --> 03:37.204
are always doing funny stuff.

03:37.204 --> 03:39.712
Yeah, yeah. Grip this
raw chicken. Really ring it out.

03:39.712 --> 03:41.150
Shake: So I thought,
"why not combine them?

03:41.150 --> 03:42.521
Have them do
something together."

03:42.521 --> 03:44.126
You bet.
Now let's work the room.

03:44.126 --> 03:45.163
Shake hands with him.

03:45.163 --> 03:46.300
Shake: What's up, dawg?

03:46.300 --> 03:47.738
Here we are
in Phoenix again, right?

03:47.738 --> 03:49.142
- You're done. Meet him.
- Shake: All right.

03:49.142 --> 03:50.313
There's the guy.

03:50.313 --> 03:51.818
- Nice to meet you, friend.
- That's enough.

03:51.818 --> 03:54.258
High-five him, but grip them
tight -- both hands.

03:54.258 --> 03:55.830
There. You did it. Move on.

03:55.830 --> 03:58.205
Lick his face.

03:58.205 --> 03:59.710
Moving on.
There's a woman -- 3:00.

03:59.710 --> 04:02.118
Shake: Yeah,
you don't have to tell me.

04:02.118 --> 04:04.391
Insert your fingers
deeply into her nose.

04:04.391 --> 04:06.030
Massage the mucus membranes.

04:06.030 --> 04:09.909
Shake: What? Look, let me just
warm her up first, all right?

04:09.909 --> 04:11.380
Fine, but make it quick.

04:12.150 --> 04:14.357
Hey, babe. A jew and a polack

04:14.357 --> 04:16.630
walk into a computer store.

04:16.630 --> 04:19.105
Get it? That's very
funny there. Do the deed.

04:19.105 --> 04:20.911
Shake: Uh, let me set this up.

04:20.911 --> 04:23.386
Funny thing -- damn it!
I lost my other card.

04:23.386 --> 04:26.128
Do the deed!
Do it! Get in there!

04:26.128 --> 04:28.301
Shake: So, uh,
what's up...there?

04:30.742 --> 04:32.648
Go back in
and french kiss that cop.

04:32.648 --> 04:35.190
Shake: Look, I'm very
unclear on our mission here.

04:35.190 --> 04:36.428
Mission accomplished.

04:36.428 --> 04:38.166
I think we did
pretty good today.

04:38.166 --> 04:40.139
Shake: What?
What is the message exactly?

04:40.139 --> 04:41.143
I'm handling the message.

04:41.143 --> 04:42.146
You're just marketing.

04:42.146 --> 04:43.416
Get us a car to the airport

04:43.416 --> 04:45.155
so we can ride around
in a bunch of planes.

04:45.155 --> 04:46.426
Shake: Uh, you know what?

04:46.426 --> 04:48.332
Um, my cat has one of them

04:48.332 --> 04:50.840
- urinary tract infections.
- So?

04:50.840 --> 04:53.448
- Shake: But she's also
getting married...
- Uh-huh.

04:53.448 --> 04:55.221
- Shake: ...to my grandfather...
- Oh.

04:55.221 --> 04:56.692
- Shake: ...who's dying.
- Mm-hmm.

04:56.692 --> 04:58.398
Shake:
...and he's in my basement,

04:58.398 --> 05:00.003
- which is flooded...
- Oh, yeah?

05:00.003 --> 05:02.310
Shake: ...and I got to be there
to sign for it.

05:02.310 --> 05:03.447
Family's important.

05:03.447 --> 05:05.320
Congratulations.
You're in our prayers.

05:05.320 --> 05:07.059
I understand
these things happen.

05:07.059 --> 05:08.430
Take all the time you need.

05:08.430 --> 05:10.202
I'll see you
at 5:00 this afternoon.

05:10.202 --> 05:12.777
Shake: Damn it.
I mean...thank you.

05:12.777 --> 05:14.550
Why don't you go ahead
and handle that dog turd

05:14.550 --> 05:16.489
before you leave?

05:16.489 --> 05:17.492
Frylock: How was work?

05:17.492 --> 05:20.502
Shake: It was...work.

05:20.502 --> 05:21.973
Frylock: Yeah, man.
You've been traveling.

05:21.973 --> 05:23.544
Did you get to see
any of the city? I mean...

05:23.544 --> 05:24.648
Shake: No, I was slammed.

05:24.648 --> 05:26.654
Working the room,
pressing flesh.

05:26.654 --> 05:28.695
Meatwad: Must have been
pressing it real hard.

05:28.695 --> 05:31.370
That thing is red, man.

05:31.370 --> 05:32.841
- Frylock: Damn.
- Shake: Oh, god.

05:32.841 --> 05:35.416
Look what you did.
I need that. Stick it back on.

05:35.416 --> 05:36.620
Frylock:
I can't sew this on, man.

05:36.620 --> 05:38.560
It's -- it's completely
disappearing.

05:38.560 --> 05:40.198
Shake: I'm not a southpaw.

05:40.198 --> 05:42.305
How am I gonna play squash now?

05:42.305 --> 05:45.549
Frylock: Aw, hell. This bacteria
looks like tiny piranha

05:45.549 --> 05:47.187
eating every damn thing
in its path.

05:47.187 --> 05:49.427
Frylock: Well, don't get it
near me. I got work.

05:49.427 --> 05:50.932
Frylock:
It came from you, dumbass!

05:50.932 --> 05:52.504
What the hell
have you been doing?!

05:52.504 --> 05:54.142
Shake: You know, work stuff.

05:54.142 --> 05:55.280
Licking eyeballs,

05:55.280 --> 05:57.186
wiping pus on children --

05:57.186 --> 05:58.155
it's a grind, man.

05:58.155 --> 06:00.630
Frylock: This is not
a legitimate job.

06:00.630 --> 06:01.667
He said what?

06:01.667 --> 06:03.740
This is just stress-related.

06:03.740 --> 06:06.014
Hold the glass steady,
god damn it!

06:06.014 --> 06:09.057
Shake: Sorry. I'm working
with just the one, you know?

06:09.057 --> 06:11.967
Dinged up, huh? Well,
that's what we signed up for...

06:11.967 --> 06:14.642
- several times.
- Shake: Yeah.

06:14.642 --> 06:17.718
Now, you ready to spit
some saliva on open sores?

06:17.718 --> 06:19.558
Shake: That's what you have us
doing this week?

06:19.558 --> 06:20.828
It's only your job.

06:20.828 --> 06:22.601
Is that okay with you?!

06:22.601 --> 06:25.510
Shake: I'm just wondering when
the jack's gonna be rolling in.

06:25.510 --> 06:27.383
Money will flow
like wine on payday,

06:27.383 --> 06:28.720
but I'm concerned
about your hand.

06:28.720 --> 06:30.058
I-I don't want you shaking hands

06:30.058 --> 06:32.600
with our top clients
without one, right?

06:32.600 --> 06:34.639
Shake:

06:34.639 --> 06:36.813
You'll shake with the nub.

06:36.813 --> 06:38.785
I want you to see
our company healthcare provider.

06:38.785 --> 06:39.789
We have excellent benefits here

06:39.789 --> 06:43.133
at bringdownthegovernment.biz.

06:43.133 --> 06:44.671
I knew there were
some advantages

06:44.671 --> 06:46.845
to going with you guys.

06:46.845 --> 06:48.316
Okay. Tell you what,
why don't you go ahead

06:48.316 --> 06:50.924
and inject yourself
with that syringe right there?

06:50.924 --> 06:53.500
- You know, I'd do it for you...
- Shake: Aah! Ohh!

06:53.500 --> 06:54.904
But my hands are dissolved.

06:54.904 --> 06:56.777
From stress, right?
It was stress?

06:56.777 --> 06:59.686
Yeah, Don. From stress.
It's what happens.

06:59.686 --> 07:01.558
That's why we make
the big bucks.

07:01.558 --> 07:02.963
Shake: Hey, wait, it's Friday?

07:02.963 --> 07:05.638
It's the weekend, right?
T.G.I.F.?

07:05.638 --> 07:07.712
Yeah, hump day!

07:07.712 --> 07:10.286
I'll see you in two hours.

07:10.286 --> 07:12.628
Shake: I scored
some serious sky miles.

07:12.628 --> 07:14.534
Frylock:
Man, you look terrible, Shake.

07:14.534 --> 07:15.871
Shake: 300 more hotel points,

07:15.871 --> 07:17.309
and I can fly to Rochester.

07:17.309 --> 07:18.781
Frylock: I think you need
to quit that job.

07:18.781 --> 07:21.823
Shake: Shh.
My manager is in this bag.

07:21.823 --> 07:23.094
Who you talking to up there?

07:23.094 --> 07:24.867
Lick his eyeball, whoever it is.

07:24.867 --> 07:26.974
Meatwad: Hey. Hey, hey, hey.

07:26.974 --> 07:28.913
Your bag is talking.

07:28.913 --> 07:30.351
Frylock:
Look, I isolated the bacteria,

07:30.351 --> 07:32.056
and I think I figured out
a way to stop it.

07:32.056 --> 07:33.896
But you need to put your
two-weeks notice in right away.

07:33.896 --> 07:35.567
Meatwad: And I been
tee-teeing in this suit,

07:35.567 --> 07:38.310
so it can be like I'm swimming
in a warm kiddie pool,

07:38.310 --> 07:41.721
'cause we ain't got the money
to join the country club.

07:41.721 --> 07:43.660
Join every club,
and lick every eyeball

07:43.660 --> 07:44.797
of the members at the club.

07:44.797 --> 07:46.236
Frylock: Let me talk
to your manager.

07:46.236 --> 07:48.074
Shake: He looks weird,
so don't say anything,

07:48.074 --> 07:50.148
'cause otherwise,
I'm gonna have to sit through

07:50.148 --> 07:51.653
a damn H.R. seminar,

07:51.653 --> 07:55.431
and that involves
a lot of injections for me.

07:55.431 --> 07:58.575
Oh. What's all this
bacteria talk?

07:58.575 --> 07:59.679
It's nonsense.

07:59.679 --> 08:02.654
We provide viral marketing
for business solutions,

08:02.654 --> 08:03.858
and that is all.

08:03.858 --> 08:05.062
Frylock:
I know your game, buddy,

08:05.062 --> 08:06.935
- and I know a way to stop it.
- You do?

08:06.935 --> 08:08.071
Frylock:
You're damn right, I do!

08:08.071 --> 08:09.944
Where does this guy
get this stuff?

08:09.944 --> 08:11.884
Speak softly.
The bacteria can hear us.

08:11.884 --> 08:13.122
- Frylock: What?
- They told my brain

08:13.122 --> 08:14.994
they would eat my mouth
if I told anyone.

08:14.994 --> 08:15.997
Frylock: Oh, my God!

08:15.997 --> 08:18.740
Help me, dear God. Help me.

08:18.740 --> 08:21.682
Frylock: This boils your blood,
and then it bleaches it.

08:21.682 --> 08:24.123
It is extremely painful,
but it should work.

08:24.123 --> 08:25.461
And it'll bring back my body?

08:25.461 --> 08:28.637
Shake: Yeah, probably.
He's pretty smart.

08:46.762 --> 08:48.869
Frylock: Well, there's
no evidence of the bacteria.

08:48.869 --> 08:49.872
Shake: So we're saved?

08:49.872 --> 08:51.076
Frylock: Yeah. You're saved.

08:51.076 --> 08:52.882
- Yeah! Hooray! All right!
- Shake: Yes!

08:52.882 --> 08:54.253
Frylock: From the bacteria.

08:54.253 --> 08:56.561
But the stuff I put inside
of you is highly flammable,

08:56.561 --> 08:59.169
and it looks like
it could combust at any time.

08:59.169 --> 09:00.807
Shake: So what are
you gonna put inside us

09:00.807 --> 09:02.580
to combat that, exactly?

09:02.580 --> 09:04.988
Frylock: Well, actually,
it's not what I'm gonna
put inside of you.

09:04.988 --> 09:07.161
It's what I'm gonna around you.

09:07.161 --> 09:08.866
Shake: I don't understand
how this glass

09:08.866 --> 09:12.277
is gonna keep the stuff
inside us from attacking us!

09:12.277 --> 09:14.284
Frylock: Yeah. Yeah.
See, I don't either.

09:14.284 --> 09:15.387
Shake: What does that mean?
'Cause, you know,

09:15.387 --> 09:17.160
I may want a second opinion.

09:17.160 --> 09:20.604
I'm not entirely sure
that you're a doc--

09:20.604 --> 09:21.775
Meatwad:
Is they frozen in there?

09:21.775 --> 09:24.383
Frylock:
Yeah, until I can find a cure.

09:24.383 --> 09:26.189
Meatwad:
I'm gonna give him a Wet Willy.

09:26.189 --> 09:28.596
Frylock: Yeah, whatever.
Knock yourself out.

09:31.974 --> 09:33.379
Meatwad: Frylock!

09:38.729 --> 09:41.404
Meatwad: Hey, you still
working on the cure, right?

09:41.404 --> 09:43.311
Frylock: Yeah, no, uh, I-I
really didn't work on it today.

09:43.311 --> 09:44.480
Meatwad:
Why ain't you doing that?

09:44.480 --> 09:45.985
Frylock:
'Cause I don't feel like it,

09:45.985 --> 09:47.958
and I damn near didn't even
bring any ice today!

09:47.958 --> 09:49.831
Meatwad: Why the hell
you need ice in a freezer?

09:49.831 --> 09:51.670
- We in a freezer, ain't we?
- Frylock: No, man.

09:51.670 --> 09:53.844
I moved y'all to a food truck
while you were sleeping...

09:53.844 --> 09:56.017
and then I drove the food truck
onto a cargo plane,

09:56.017 --> 09:59.295
and...well...
now we're on Jurassic Island.

09:59.295 --> 10:01.101
Meatwad: Jurassic what?
That's where there

10:01.101 --> 10:03.007
all the dinosaurs
roaming around,

10:03.007 --> 10:04.378
looking for human popsicles!

10:04.378 --> 10:05.949
Frylock: I ain't
heard about that!

10:05.949 --> 10:07.956
I'll have to check with my
new friend Michael Crichton,

10:07.956 --> 10:09.761
- see if he's heard about that.
- Meatwad: All right, then.

10:09.761 --> 10:11.567
Frylock: Aw, hell.
He's thawing out, isn't he?

10:11.567 --> 10:14.042
Look, I need to keep them
ice-cold for when I find a cure.

10:14.042 --> 10:16.417
Meatwad: Yeah,
the one you ain't working on?

10:16.417 --> 10:19.125
And what's all that
cool music I keep hearing?

10:19.125 --> 10:21.232
'Cause that is a jam, son.

10:21.232 --> 10:23.339
Frylock:
It's just classic rock radio.

10:23.339 --> 10:24.342
Meatwad: There it is again --

10:24.342 --> 10:26.415
something I can dance to!

10:26.415 --> 10:28.054
Make me want to twerk.

10:28.054 --> 10:29.090
Shake:

10:29.090 --> 10:30.896
Hey. Are you awake?

10:30.896 --> 10:32.997
Are we cured?
We're cured, right?

10:32.997 --> 10:34.464
- Shake: We must be.
- Ice cream, ice cream.

10:34.464 --> 10:37.164
- Give me some ice cream!
- Shake: You hear something?

10:37.164 --> 10:39.631
Meatwad: Someone giving out
ice cream out there!

10:39.631 --> 10:40.664
That's what I hear!

10:40.664 --> 10:42.264
Shake: Whoo! Ice cream!

10:42.264 --> 10:44.364
Frylock: Napkins
are in the truck. Help yourself.

10:44.364 --> 10:46.364
Ice cream!

10:46.364 --> 10:47.597
Happy birthday, twins!

10:48.731 --> 10:51.131
Shake:
Freeze me! Freeze me back!
