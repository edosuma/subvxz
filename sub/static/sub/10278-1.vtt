00:09.000 --> 00:11.264
There's a drug rehab center in Atlanta...

00:11.265 --> 00:14.778
that specializes in treating doctors
with addictions.

00:14.779 --> 00:15.779
Forget it. Forget it.

00:15.780 --> 00:18.175
- This is your only chance, Greg.
- All right, I quit.

00:18.176 --> 00:19.176
You'll end up like your cousin,
some babbling gork in a nursing home.

00:27.045 --> 00:28.691
It's all right.

00:44.130 --> 00:46.502
E. R. 7x01 "HOMECOMING"

01:06.734 --> 01:08.477
- Hi.
- Name?

01:08.652 --> 01:12.068
Dr. Carter.
Somebody should have called ahead.

01:24.750 --> 01:29.957
Okay. All the information is confidential,
and you can have a seat over there.

01:31.298 --> 01:32.875
Thank you.

01:39.305 --> 01:42.590
Ninety days?
This is a three-month program?

01:42.766 --> 01:45.138
Yeah, I guess so.

01:45.936 --> 01:50.099
Can you send me some clothes?
Or do they issue prison garb here?

01:52.567 --> 01:54.476
- You okay?
- This pen doesn't work.

01:54.652 --> 01:56.645
Do you have a pen?

01:58.489 --> 02:00.316
- He's diaphoretic.
- We'll handle it.

02:00.491 --> 02:01.985
- When?
- Soon.

02:02.159 --> 02:04.863
- He needs something.
- You should go now.

02:05.036 --> 02:09.497
- What?
- It's important that he checks himself in.

02:12.835 --> 02:14.413
Right.

02:16.338 --> 02:17.832
Here.

02:21.676 --> 02:24.594
You...
You good from here?

02:27.807 --> 02:30.049
Yeah, I guess so.

02:32.811 --> 02:35.302
Carter, you can do this.

02:53.413 --> 02:54.824
You got any Compazine?

02:55.540 --> 02:58.031
I'll give you something after group,
if you're still nauseous.

02:58.460 --> 03:00.701
- "Group"?
- Yeah. Group therapy.

03:00.878 --> 03:02.705
- When is that?
- Now.

03:02.880 --> 03:04.540
In the middle of the night?

03:04.715 --> 03:08.000
The group meets
when a new patient arrives.

03:20.730 --> 03:22.805
- Ready?
- No, I need to lie down.

03:22.982 --> 03:24.013
You'll make it.

03:24.191 --> 03:26.480
Group therapy is not what I need now.

03:26.652 --> 03:29.736
If you want to be in the program,
do the program.

03:29.905 --> 03:31.482
Otherwise, you can leave.

03:31.656 --> 03:34.776
And when you want a fix, you can
score down on 1 Oth and Piedmont.

03:34.951 --> 03:39.861
Which is six blocks down, one over.
Those guys are out there all night.

03:55.511 --> 03:57.384
John Carter?

03:57.554 --> 03:59.132
Yes.

04:51.144 --> 04:52.175
Security!

04:54.147 --> 04:56.305
- I put the needle down!
- No needles!

04:56.482 --> 04:58.854
- I told you to put him in restraints.
- I did.

04:59.026 --> 05:01.149
- Get extra security.
- On their way.

05:01.320 --> 05:02.648
Give him Haldol!

05:02.822 --> 05:04.814
- The toilet's clogged.
- Unclog it.

05:04.990 --> 05:07.148
No plunger.
Maintenance closet's locked.

05:07.326 --> 05:10.112
Malucci, what is Mr. Hunter
still doing out here?

05:10.287 --> 05:13.786
Transpo's backed up. Their guys are
out to support the janitors.

05:13.957 --> 05:16.530
- Then you take him.
- Give them their raise.

05:16.709 --> 05:19.496
I'll recommend you
for the negotiating committee.

05:19.670 --> 05:22.224
- What about the maintenance closet?
- I don't know, Malik. Use some initiative.

05:22.298 --> 05:25.371
Pick the lock. Take a fire ax.
I really don't care.

05:25.550 --> 05:29.334
Oh, my God. Can somebody put
Mr. Spencer in an Exam Room?

05:29.512 --> 05:31.220
- Excuse me.
- What?

05:31.389 --> 05:32.943
We've been waiting here for a while.

05:32.978 --> 05:36.135
- Shouldn't we be doing something?
- Any plumbing experience?

05:36.310 --> 05:40.259
- What happened?
- Mark, just don't start with me, okay?

05:40.439 --> 05:44.353
- Custodial staff is on strike.
- So they destroyed the admit desk?

05:44.526 --> 05:48.060
This is a remodel. Open floor plan.
It's supposed to be safer.

05:48.237 --> 05:50.562
I've scratched myself on a nail twice.

05:50.740 --> 05:52.364
Make suer you update your tetanus.

05:52.533 --> 05:54.821
- Where are my fans?
- Working on it.

05:54.993 --> 05:56.238
What's the deal?

05:56.411 --> 05:59.614
The construction workers
won't cross the picket line.

05:59.789 --> 06:02.225
Those three guys I saw with signs?

06:02.260 --> 06:04.537
- Mark, how was your vacation?
- It was good.

06:04.711 --> 06:07.082
- Go anywhere?
- Wisconsin Dells. Camping.

06:07.255 --> 06:09.046
I just drove back this morning.

06:09.215 --> 06:12.049
- Where's the board supposed to go?
- Don't ask.

06:12.217 --> 06:14.293
They weren't supposed
to take out this wall.

06:14.469 --> 06:15.880
Don't talk about it.

06:16.054 --> 06:18.723
- Cleo, you got that covered?
- Yeah.

06:18.890 --> 06:21.178
- I hate needles!
- Hi, Dr. Greene.

06:21.351 --> 06:24.802
Is it me, or do those med students
look like 12-year-olds?

06:24.979 --> 06:26.971
- How long they been waiting?
- Three hours.

06:27.147 --> 06:28.891
- Two and a half.
- I'll take them.

06:29.066 --> 06:32.731
Be my guest. But make sure
you see some patients.

06:32.903 --> 06:35.061
- Malik?
- What?

06:35.238 --> 06:36.732
Malik.

06:36.906 --> 06:40.405
Strong heartbeat. The amount
of amniotic fluid is normal.

06:40.576 --> 06:42.319
Everything looks fine.

06:42.495 --> 06:45.412
I've got a good angle
if you wanna know the sex.

06:45.581 --> 06:47.324
Sure.

06:47.499 --> 06:51.959
You are having a boy.

06:52.128 --> 06:54.251
Congratulations.

06:54.422 --> 06:55.999
Thank you.

06:57.591 --> 07:01.292
Your blood-sugar level is normal.
But you're a little anemic.

07:01.470 --> 07:03.758
- You taking any iron?
- Yes.

07:04.431 --> 07:07.681
You arrange with Kerry
to take time off after the birth?

07:07.851 --> 07:09.511
No, not yet.

07:11.979 --> 07:13.806
You still have time.

07:16.817 --> 07:20.482
Actually, I haven't told anyone yet.

07:20.654 --> 07:23.323
I think you may want to.

07:23.782 --> 07:27.649
I don't see how you can keep this
a secret much longer.

07:28.619 --> 07:30.161
Yeah.

07:32.498 --> 07:36.282
So, what are you supposed
to talk about in an exit interview?

07:36.460 --> 07:40.374
- That you don't have all the answers.
- No argument there.

07:40.547 --> 07:42.456
You scared?

07:43.174 --> 07:46.009
I don't remember
the last time I wasn't scared.

07:46.177 --> 07:47.719
Good.

07:47.887 --> 07:51.338
What, that's it?
"Be afraid. Be very afraid"?

07:51.515 --> 07:54.599
We're like the Army, okay?
We break you down...

07:54.768 --> 07:58.018
...make you face your addiction,
then we build you up.

07:58.188 --> 08:01.437
You start to function.
Feel healthy, confident.

08:01.816 --> 08:04.188
Don't worry.
Pride's what got me into this.

08:04.360 --> 08:08.903
And deep down, you feel like this
is something that just happened to you.

08:09.072 --> 08:12.358
No, I took responsibility.
I take responsibility.

08:12.534 --> 08:16.531
But I'm gonna get my life back.
It's not gonna beat me.

08:18.539 --> 08:22.952
Yeah, that's what I thought.
First three times.

08:23.127 --> 08:25.452
But I hope you do.

08:26.505 --> 08:29.589
Day or night. If you ever need to talk.

08:29.758 --> 08:32.711
- Are we done?
- You're just getting started.

08:32.885 --> 08:35.008
Is this where I'm supposed
to say thank you?

08:35.179 --> 08:37.219
- Some people do.
- Thank you.

08:37.390 --> 08:38.884
You're welcome.

08:39.558 --> 08:42.890
- Someone's still on vacation time I see.
- Sorry.

08:43.061 --> 08:46.560
Peter was just helping me
hang this straight. How's that?

08:46.731 --> 08:47.763
Great.

08:47.941 --> 08:50.396
- Did you finish the interview?
- We're getting there.

08:50.568 --> 08:53.438
Okay, so where were we
before we left off last time?

08:53.613 --> 08:55.819
You were just about
to give me the job.

08:55.990 --> 09:00.782
Developing a sense of humor, Peter?
That's progress. You get points for that.

09:00.953 --> 09:05.032
Why don't we discuss
faculty responsibilities?

09:05.206 --> 09:07.614
Peter, as an Attending,
you'd be responsible...

09:07.792 --> 09:10.828
...for supervising Resident research.

09:11.003 --> 09:13.541
- I look forward to that.
- Liar.

09:13.714 --> 09:16.631
- I like working with Residents.
- You mean you like abusing them.

09:16.800 --> 09:19.754
You don't have the best track record
in the research department.

09:19.928 --> 09:22.466
- That can change.
- Where else have you applied?

09:22.639 --> 09:25.343
- What?
- Where else did you apply?

09:26.267 --> 09:27.429
You can't ask me that.

09:27.602 --> 09:29.594
Oh, no. Someone call
the interview police.

09:29.937 --> 09:31.976
Has anyone offered you anything?

09:32.147 --> 09:33.392
You're not supposed to ask me
that either.

09:33.565 --> 09:35.807
Come on. It's a simple question.

09:35.984 --> 09:38.190
I've looked elsewhere as a backup.

09:38.361 --> 09:41.148
But I'd like to stay
here as an Attending.

09:41.322 --> 09:44.857
Okay. Was that so difficult?
Elizabeth, what are you doing?

09:45.034 --> 09:47.489
My hands itch for some reason.

09:47.661 --> 09:49.120
Cut it out. It's distracting.

09:49.288 --> 09:52.787
Linear vesicles. Probably a phytodermatitis.
Are you allergic to any plants?

09:52.958 --> 09:54.784
- I don't think so.
- You have a garden?

09:54.959 --> 09:57.960
- I went camping.
- You do know what poison ivy looks like.

09:58.296 --> 10:00.621
Poison ivy? Is that in Wisconsin?

10:00.798 --> 10:03.519
Oh, boy. Sorry, Peter, I gotta run.

10:03.554 --> 10:05.873
- We'll have to finish this later.
- When?

10:06.053 --> 10:08.804
My office will reschedule.
Good luck with that, Lizzie.

10:08.972 --> 10:10.632
He's never gonna give me this job.

10:10.807 --> 10:12.634
Yes, he will.
He's just being Robert.

10:12.809 --> 10:15.596
Don't scratch. Put some
hydrocortisone TID on it.

10:15.770 --> 10:17.643
If it gets worse,
get a shot of steroids.

10:17.813 --> 10:19.391
It won't spread, will it?

10:19.565 --> 10:21.356
That depends
on what you touched last...

10:21.525 --> 10:23.814
...before you washed your hands.

10:24.444 --> 10:26.022
Oh, dear.

10:26.196 --> 10:28.484
These are your orientation packets.

10:28.656 --> 10:31.278
You guys have a seat over there
and read them over, okay?

10:31.451 --> 10:32.945
Then we'll give you the tour.

10:33.119 --> 10:36.036
We'll go over charts, order sheets
and discharge instructions.

10:36.205 --> 10:38.032
Any questions?

10:38.207 --> 10:41.789
Remember, you're students. The only
stupid question is the one you don't ask.

10:41.960 --> 10:44.332
- Dr. Greene? Well, I have a question.
- What?

10:44.504 --> 10:46.212
Something wrong
with the Australian boys?

10:46.381 --> 10:48.788
- Who?
- You're scratching "down under. "

10:48.966 --> 10:52.382
Oh, yeah. Doesn't make
a good first impression.

10:52.553 --> 10:55.637
- Pickman, what do you got?
- Mike Palmieri, 17. Wide receiver.

10:55.806 --> 10:59.009
Got hi-lowed in midair. Brief LOC.
Complains of neck and chest pains.

10:59.184 --> 11:01.971
- Can he move extremities?
- Yes. Due to the hands' numbness...

11:02.145 --> 11:05.015
- ... we left the helmet on.
- Give the med students the tour.

11:05.189 --> 11:07.858
- I gave it last rotation.
- Then you're getting good at it.

11:08.025 --> 11:11.061
Okay, Mike, I'm Dr. Greene.
Can you squeeze both my hands?

11:11.236 --> 11:15.020
- My neck's not broken, is it?
- Now we're gonna check you out.

11:16.032 --> 11:18.155
- Mike, does your chest hurt?
- A little.

11:18.326 --> 11:20.864
The safety speared me with his
helmet on the way down.

11:21.037 --> 11:25.533
- He's tachy at 120. BP's 110/68.
- Good breath sounds bilaterally.

11:25.708 --> 11:28.281
It's illegal. Second play of the game.

11:28.460 --> 11:31.959
- Let's get him on a pulse ox.
- They were looking to take me out.

11:32.130 --> 11:34.965
- Who's that? The other team?
- They're our rivals.

11:35.133 --> 11:37.125
- It's their homecoming.
- You want to push any drugs?

11:37.302 --> 11:39.543
Sure. One amp of epi
and a mg of atropine.

11:39.720 --> 11:41.512
Does she have a pulse?

11:41.931 --> 11:43.923
- Oh, she's dead.
- I know.

11:44.099 --> 11:45.641
Like, blue dead.

11:45.809 --> 11:48.217
- Pulse ox, 65.
- That's because she's dead.

11:48.395 --> 11:50.968
Her husband drove her in.

11:53.650 --> 11:55.975
- Right.
- Luka, you okay in here?

11:56.152 --> 11:58.228
- Yeah, I've got it, Kerry.
- Still asystole.

11:58.404 --> 12:01.607
As long as we're faking it, can one
of the med students practice CPR?

12:01.782 --> 12:05.067
No. Go outside and tell him
we are doing everything we can...

12:05.243 --> 12:07.948
- ... but his wife is very sick.
- She can't get any sicker.

12:08.121 --> 12:09.781
Malucci, please. Go on.

12:09.956 --> 12:12.244
Give the poor man some time
to prepare himself.

12:12.417 --> 12:15.750
No problem, chief. I can act
with the best of them. Watch this.

12:16.253 --> 12:20.037
- Still flat line. Want to do a fluid bolus?
- No, that's okay.

12:20.215 --> 12:23.169
- Abby? Abby!
- Yeah?

12:23.343 --> 12:25.170
The registrar didn't
put your name down.

12:25.345 --> 12:28.464
- You sure you're back on ER rotation?
- That's what my schedule says.

12:28.639 --> 12:32.257
Okay. They must be backed up
because of the strike.

12:43.278 --> 12:45.947
- Checking out?
- Yeah.

12:48.407 --> 12:52.072
Dr. Benton called to confirm your flight
and said he'd pick you up at the gate.

12:52.244 --> 12:53.786
Thanks.

13:05.631 --> 13:08.916
- Goodbye, Margaret.
- Good luck, Dr. Carter.

13:21.437 --> 13:22.765
Where did he go?

13:22.938 --> 13:25.939
He was in the hallway
with Malucci a minute ago.

13:31.112 --> 13:33.271
Here's her medication.
I forgot it in the car.

13:33.448 --> 13:37.315
She's on Elavil,
and codeine for arthritis.

13:37.493 --> 13:40.114
Have a seat, Mr. Bristo.

13:42.748 --> 13:45.073
You don't need these?

13:50.088 --> 13:55.960
Mr. Bristo, your wife has suffered
a massive heart attack.

13:58.721 --> 14:02.765
We exhausted all medical
resources available to us.

14:02.933 --> 14:08.271
But the damage to her heart was beyond
our capabilities to save her.

14:11.607 --> 14:15.142
She died, Mr. Bristo. I'm sorry.

14:15.319 --> 14:18.485
You see? I should have called
the ambulance sooner.

14:18.655 --> 14:21.110
I should have gotten her here quicker.

14:21.283 --> 14:26.324
There's nothing you could have done
differently that would have saved her.

14:26.829 --> 14:32.119
It was just her time.
Would you like to see her?

14:33.794 --> 14:35.502
Okay.

14:42.677 --> 14:44.420
How was I supposed to know?

14:44.595 --> 14:46.303
- Excuse us.
- Sorry.

14:46.472 --> 14:49.259
Haven't you ever heard of
"leaves of three, let it be"?

14:49.433 --> 14:50.761
What?

14:50.934 --> 14:54.978
"Leaves of three, let it be. "
As in don't touch.

14:55.146 --> 14:58.515
Sorry. We don't have
poison ivy in England.

14:58.691 --> 15:02.274
"Leaves of three" or any other kind.

15:04.363 --> 15:05.905
- Oh, man.
- Let me see.

15:06.073 --> 15:07.615
- No, no.
- Mark, don't be shy.

15:07.783 --> 15:10.700
- You've done enough damage.
- Well, do you have it?

15:10.869 --> 15:13.027
Yes, I have it.

15:15.540 --> 15:17.034
Who picks poison ivy?

15:17.208 --> 15:19.117
I was making a wildflower bouquet.

15:19.293 --> 15:22.709
- C-spine's back on the football player.
- Thanks.

15:22.880 --> 15:25.549
When you went skinny-dipping
in the lake, I got bored.

15:25.716 --> 15:28.041
You remember what happened
after you got out?

15:28.218 --> 15:30.294
- Yeah. It's a big price to pay.
- Mark.

15:30.470 --> 15:32.462
I have to worry about
where you've been?

15:32.638 --> 15:36.303
- It's not that horrible.
- You've only got it on your hands.

15:36.475 --> 15:40.223
- Mike, x-ray is normal.
- His mom's here, out in Chairs.

15:40.395 --> 15:43.645
Okay. Why don't you get off the helmet
and pads and I'll be right back?

15:43.815 --> 15:47.065
- Does that mean I can go?
- Not yet.

15:48.903 --> 15:51.572
So do you want the cream
or the shot?

15:51.739 --> 15:54.905
- Probably both.
- Fine. I'll get them.

15:59.746 --> 16:02.415
- Mrs. Palmieri?
- Yes?

16:02.582 --> 16:05.287
Hi. I'm Dr. Mark Greene. Good news.

16:05.460 --> 16:07.748
Mike's neck x-ray came back normal.

16:08.379 --> 16:10.122
No fractures or swelling.

16:10.631 --> 16:12.090
Why were his hands numb?

16:12.257 --> 16:14.795
He was hyperventilating.
That can cause numbness.

16:15.218 --> 16:16.416
But no nerve damage?

16:16.595 --> 16:20.046
No. No broken bones,
no spinal-cord injury, no paralysis.

16:20.223 --> 16:22.678
Thank you. Thank you.
Can I see him?

16:22.892 --> 16:24.267
Sure. Here you go.

16:24.435 --> 16:26.474
- What's your name again?
- Priya Shailendra.

16:26.687 --> 16:29.094
- Do you remember where Trauma 1 is?
- I think so.

16:29.273 --> 16:31.182
- Could you take Mrs. Palmieri?
- Certainly.

16:31.258 --> 16:33.600
This way, please.

16:34.527 --> 16:37.279
- Malucci?
- Hey, Dr. Greene. How's that jock itch?

16:37.447 --> 16:39.569
I told you to supervise
the med students.

16:39.740 --> 16:41.614
You told me to give them the tour.
I did.

16:41.784 --> 16:43.326
Show them the charting system.

16:43.494 --> 16:47.112
- I'm juggling eight patients here.
- Have them help you.

16:47.289 --> 16:49.162
Hold this.

16:50.041 --> 16:52.710
Hey, Cleo. You're up
with the med students.

16:52.877 --> 16:54.122
- Says who?
- Dr. Greene.

16:54.295 --> 16:56.537
Then Dr. Greene can ask me.

16:56.714 --> 17:00.498
It's not infected, Mr. Fletcher,
but I'm gonna have to débride it again.

17:00.676 --> 17:02.799
No. Leave it alone.

17:02.970 --> 17:07.181
I would if you changed the dressing
four times a day like I told you.

17:07.348 --> 17:10.266
I'm not a damn nurse.

17:10.435 --> 17:13.601
- How'd it go?
- It didn't. Romano postponed.

17:13.813 --> 17:17.727
- Again? What's wrong with him?
- He's a maniacal sadist.

17:17.942 --> 17:20.515
- What did you call me?
- Not you, Mr. Fletcher.

17:20.986 --> 17:23.310
Is this machine working?
I feel like I'm drowning.

17:23.488 --> 17:25.564
It takes longer when
you're fluid-overloaded.

17:25.740 --> 17:27.982
Happens when you're three
days late for dialysis.

17:28.159 --> 17:32.785
I told you my son didn't have time
to drive me to the clinic.

17:32.955 --> 17:35.528
What's wrong with this picture?

17:35.708 --> 17:38.625
Those med students.
Not a black face in the bunch.

17:40.420 --> 17:42.377
That doesn't concern you?

17:42.589 --> 17:45.589
I see five. Not exactly a
representative sample.

17:45.925 --> 17:49.045
Glad you take such an active interest.

17:49.220 --> 17:51.793
You're gonna have to hold
your foot still, Mr. Fletcher.

17:51.972 --> 17:53.347
She your wife?

17:54.308 --> 17:55.802
No. No, no, no, no.

17:56.017 --> 18:01.936
- She talk like she your wife.
- Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

18:03.149 --> 18:05.556
Brought you a chair, Mr. Bristo.

18:05.735 --> 18:09.684
Someone will be by to take her
downstairs but it could take a while.

18:10.864 --> 18:14.031
Do you have a funeral home
you'd like to use? I could call them.

18:14.200 --> 18:18.696
We have two plots. But Florence took
care of it. I forget the name.

18:18.871 --> 18:20.282
Okay, well, if you remember.

18:20.456 --> 18:23.706
- Can I stay with her?
- As long as you like.

18:29.714 --> 18:32.336
It was very decent of you to
work on his wife like that.

18:32.509 --> 18:33.884
Part of the job.

18:34.052 --> 18:36.589
Well, no. I mean, he's really shaken.

18:36.762 --> 18:39.170
It could be worse if he
thought he was responsible.

18:39.348 --> 18:43.428
He does. He's alive, she's not.

18:44.478 --> 18:48.938
- Wonder how long they were married.
- I don't know. Forever, probably.

18:49.107 --> 18:51.598
- How long have you?
- What?

18:51.776 --> 18:53.852
Been married.

18:54.195 --> 18:56.068
I'm not.

18:57.198 --> 19:00.566
I thought someone told me
you were married.

19:01.952 --> 19:06.530
I was. But my divorce
became final last month.

19:06.706 --> 19:09.790
- Sorry.
- Don't be. I'm not.

19:09.959 --> 19:14.252
- Lockhart, is that your name or his?
- It's his. But I'm keeping it...

19:14.421 --> 19:17.090
...because it's the only good thing
I got out of it.

19:17.257 --> 19:20.460
- Why? What was your name before?
- Wyczenski.

19:20.927 --> 19:22.920
Right. Lockhart is better.

19:23.096 --> 19:25.551
- Have you seen Dr. Greene?
- Suture Room, I think.

19:25.723 --> 19:28.510
- Oh, Dr. Weaver's looking for you.
- Me?

19:28.684 --> 19:30.427
Yeah.

19:34.773 --> 19:37.264
Dr. Greene... Sorry. Sorry.

19:37.442 --> 19:40.692
- That's okay, Haleh. Just getting a shot.
- I didn't say anything.

19:40.862 --> 19:42.024
What's up?

19:42.196 --> 19:44.272
Mike Palmieri is having
trouble breathing.

19:44.448 --> 19:46.904
Complained of chest pains
when we removed the pads.

19:47.076 --> 19:49.199
All right. I'll be right there.

19:50.412 --> 19:53.578
- You done?
- All done.

19:53.748 --> 19:57.449
- Keep laughing, flower girl.
- You're welcome.

19:57.627 --> 20:00.118
Thanks a lot.

20:02.631 --> 20:04.339
Mike, how's your breathing?

20:04.508 --> 20:05.753
A little sore.

20:05.926 --> 20:07.206
Okay. Tell me if this hurts.

20:07.386 --> 20:10.636
BP's stable. 115/70.
Satting at 98.

20:10.805 --> 20:12.845
- There.
- Okay. Any belly pain?

20:13.016 --> 20:15.341
- No.
- Are you sure?

20:15.518 --> 20:16.798
- A little.
- Okay.

20:16.978 --> 20:19.682
Haleh, book a CT.
And let's sit him up.

20:19.855 --> 20:23.224
- Where's your mom, Mike?
- She went to check on the score for me.

20:23.400 --> 20:25.191
If we're losing, I need to get back.

20:25.360 --> 20:28.195
We need to take another picture
of your chest and belly...

20:28.363 --> 20:31.566
- ... just to make sure everything's okay.
- How long does that take?

20:31.741 --> 20:35.026
Relax, Mike. You're gonna be
with us for a while.

20:35.911 --> 20:38.402
- Mrs. Palmieri?
- What happened?

20:38.580 --> 20:41.498
Nothing serious. Mike might have
a broken rib.

20:41.667 --> 20:44.786
And I need a CAT scan to make sure
that it didn't nick his liver.

20:44.961 --> 20:46.870
His liver? What does that mean?

20:47.088 --> 20:50.539
Well, it all depends. But it's really
a remote possibility.

20:50.716 --> 20:52.175
I just want to make sure.

20:52.510 --> 20:56.424
I knew something like this was gonna
happen. I hate that he plays football.

20:56.638 --> 20:59.473
But it keeps his grades up.
He's not a great student...

20:59.641 --> 21:02.428
...but he has to keep good grades
to play so I let him play.

21:02.602 --> 21:04.559
I'm sure everything
is gonna be just fine.

21:04.729 --> 21:07.480
I'll check back with you
after the scan.

21:07.648 --> 21:09.688
Chen?

21:10.276 --> 21:11.355
- Chen!
- Yes.

21:11.527 --> 21:12.807
- You okay?
- Yeah. Great.

21:12.986 --> 21:15.358
Can you find Dr. Corday
and have her meet me in CT?

21:15.530 --> 21:19.528
- No problem.
- BP, 136/88. Pulse, 125.

21:19.701 --> 21:22.274
They nailed me after the play.
Refs didn't even call it.

21:22.453 --> 21:25.324
Draw up some Demerol.
Open tibial fracture.

21:25.498 --> 21:27.704
Titrate 100, slow IV push.

21:27.875 --> 21:29.951
55. That's the number of
the guy who hit Mike.

21:30.127 --> 21:32.796
- It was a clean hit.
- GSW on the way. Crashing in the rig.

21:32.963 --> 21:33.994
Frank. What's open?

21:34.172 --> 21:36.330
Stiff in Trauma 2.
Other than that we're booked.

21:36.508 --> 21:38.167
- Clear it. Take this guy.
- Got it.

21:38.343 --> 21:40.382
You led with your helmet.
You're not supposed to.

21:40.553 --> 21:42.236
Man you'll to wait back in chair.

21:42.271 --> 21:43.713
- It was an accident.
- It was a cheap shot.

21:43.889 --> 21:45.846
What do you call breaking my leg
on purpose?

21:46.016 --> 21:47.047
Payback!

21:51.980 --> 21:53.937
Thank you.

21:54.440 --> 21:56.397
Sir? Sir?

21:58.069 --> 22:00.606
- Oh, thank you.
- Can I get a gin and tonic, please?

22:00.821 --> 22:03.905
- Anything for you, sir?
- No, thank you.

22:05.575 --> 22:06.904
From Atlanta or Chicago?

22:07.577 --> 22:09.155
Chicago.

22:09.329 --> 22:12.033
- Atlanta on business?
- No.

22:13.291 --> 22:14.619
Vacation?

22:15.960 --> 22:18.083
I was just visiting a friend.

22:23.216 --> 22:28.341
- So, what do you do for a living?
- I'm a teacher. High school English.

22:29.722 --> 22:31.964
And you fly first class?

22:32.183 --> 22:36.512
They must pay teachers
pretty well in Chicago.

22:36.687 --> 22:38.596
Excuse me.

23:13.136 --> 23:15.129
Mr. Bristo?

23:15.305 --> 23:17.131
They needed the room.

23:18.808 --> 23:20.966
Well, don't worry.
We'll find her another room.

23:21.143 --> 23:24.393
- Are they coming to get her?
- Yeah. Soon. They're coming soon.

23:25.022 --> 23:27.061
- Lost the pulse!
- Starting compressions.

23:27.232 --> 23:28.726
What's on the monitor?

23:28.900 --> 23:31.272
- P.E.A.
- Amp of epi. Squeeze in the blood.

23:31.444 --> 23:34.315
Malucci has an assaulted
cheerleader coming. Bat to the face.

23:34.489 --> 23:36.149
- Okay. Get Mark.
- He's in CT.

23:36.324 --> 23:37.569
Got a pulse.

23:37.742 --> 23:39.948
Increase dopamine.
Get him up to the O.R.

23:40.119 --> 23:41.613
You finished in the Trauma Room?

23:41.787 --> 23:44.408
Yeah. Abby, I'm glad I saw you.
I need to talk to you.

23:44.581 --> 23:45.909
Somebody find Kovac, please?!

23:46.083 --> 23:49.534
This man's wife died. We told him he
could wait until Transpo picks her up.

23:49.711 --> 23:52.795
We'll lean on them. I checked with
the medical-school registrar...

23:52.964 --> 23:54.374
- ... and they...
- Out of the way!

23:54.549 --> 23:56.292
- ... retracted your clerkship-
- What?!

23:56.467 --> 23:58.294
Is that from the football game too?

23:58.469 --> 24:00.342
Yeah, someone jumped her
in the bathroom.

24:00.512 --> 24:03.085
- Dr. Weaver?
- Something about delinquent tuition.

24:03.265 --> 24:05.802
My ex-husband was supposed
to pay that. I apologize.

24:05.975 --> 24:08.680
- No need to apologize.
- I'll get it paid by tomorrow.

24:08.853 --> 24:10.762
You don't understand.
You need to go home.

24:10.938 --> 24:14.389
- You're not covered to work.
- I'll work it out with the registrar-

24:14.567 --> 24:16.440
Once a clerkship is pulled, it's pulled.

24:16.610 --> 24:19.480
Nothing I can do. You have
to wait till the next quarter.

24:19.654 --> 24:21.563
- In three months?
- Sorry. Dean's decision.

24:21.740 --> 24:24.361
- We got a blown pupil!
- Turn in your lab coat to Frank.

24:24.534 --> 24:27.404
- Heart rate's dropping.
- Prep for an intubation.

24:27.578 --> 24:30.449
Hang the mannitol. 40 of Lasix.
She needs a Foley.

24:30.623 --> 24:32.496
Give me some gloves, somebody!
Move!

24:32.666 --> 24:34.374
Pressure's sky-high.
180/120.

24:34.543 --> 24:38.706
Bolus her with 100 of lidocaine,
75 of sux...

24:47.054 --> 24:50.055
- What's this for?
- Sorry. Sorry.

24:50.224 --> 24:52.015
Abby, what's wrong? Abby?

24:53.060 --> 24:54.886
Abby?

25:04.361 --> 25:08.228
- You got cleaned up. Looks good.
- Thank you.

25:10.033 --> 25:14.410
I'd choose the fish if I were you.
The steak looks...

25:14.579 --> 25:15.907
I'm not hungry.

25:17.790 --> 25:21.325
Excuse me, Dr. Carter.
Were you smoking in the lavatory?

25:26.256 --> 25:27.287
Yes.

25:27.674 --> 25:31.339
Then you're in violation of federal
law, punishable by a $2000 fine...

25:31.552 --> 25:32.797
...and imprisonment.

25:32.970 --> 25:34.797
Do I need the
marshals at the gate?

25:34.972 --> 25:37.178
No. It won't happen again.

25:37.808 --> 25:39.468
Do you have the butt with you?

25:51.862 --> 25:53.902
All right then.

25:56.784 --> 25:59.025
Doctor?

26:00.704 --> 26:02.992
Mrs. Palmieri?

26:04.457 --> 26:05.832
What is it?

26:06.000 --> 26:07.660
Apparently, the blow to Michael's chest...

26:07.835 --> 26:10.160
caused a little internal bleeding.

26:10.588 --> 26:13.292
Some of it in the sac
surrounding his heart.

26:13.841 --> 26:16.627
- Oh, God. That sounds serious.
- It can be...

26:16.802 --> 26:20.087
...but right now there's only a small
amount. But we need to operate...

26:20.263 --> 26:22.718
...to drain the blood
before it restricts function.

26:23.141 --> 26:24.516
Open-heart surgery?

26:24.725 --> 26:28.011
No. We go through the upper abdomen,
very small incision.

26:28.729 --> 26:32.678
It's a really simple procedure.
I just need you to...

26:32.858 --> 26:35.230
- Now?
- I just need you to sign the consent.

26:35.402 --> 26:37.394
You're gonna do the surgery now?

26:38.613 --> 26:41.982
Right now Mike's blood pressure
is stable, which is a good sign.

26:42.658 --> 26:46.821
But more blood could accumulate. We
need to do the operation immediately...

26:46.995 --> 26:49.403
...to avoid an emergency
procedure down here.

26:49.748 --> 26:52.832
You just need one signature, right?

26:53.001 --> 26:55.788
I couldn't find his father if I wanted to.

26:56.004 --> 26:57.284
- One is enough.
- All right.

26:57.463 --> 26:59.835
- What's the emergency? I'm here.
- I didn't call you.

27:00.007 --> 27:02.877
- Robert.
- If you're gonna leave messages...

27:03.052 --> 27:06.634
...with my assistant, don't also
page me. It gets annoyingly redundant.

27:06.805 --> 27:10.672
Sorry to inconvenience you, Robert,
but we have a real crisis down here.

27:10.850 --> 27:13.851
- Yeah? And?
- And it's become a health hazard.

27:14.020 --> 27:16.593
If somebody calls the county,
we'll be fined.

27:16.772 --> 27:19.559
But someone's not going to call
the county, is she?

27:19.733 --> 27:23.517
Housekeeping won't clean any sheets
or towels. I need the nurses here.

27:23.695 --> 27:25.522
It's not their job anyway
to be doing-

27:25.697 --> 27:28.651
What do you want me to say?
Troubleshoot. It's being a manager.

27:28.825 --> 27:33.202
- You need to end this strike, Robert.
- Find the half-million it'll take, I will.

27:33.370 --> 27:36.241
- Peter, keeping banker's hours?
- I've been on since 5.

27:36.415 --> 27:39.250
- Well, you got a sec?
- I gotta go pick up somebody-

27:39.418 --> 27:40.662
- Let's finish this.
- What?

27:40.836 --> 27:43.326
- The interview. Walk with me.
- What about Elizabeth?

27:43.505 --> 27:46.458
I let her sit in to make her feel
important. It's my decision.

27:46.632 --> 27:50.381
Let's talk turkey. I know you've got the
surgical skills. I don't question that.

27:50.553 --> 27:53.802
- I do question your loyalty.
- My loyalty lies with my patients.

27:53.972 --> 27:56.463
As it should. But don't take this
the wrong way...

27:56.641 --> 27:59.891
...you have a real propensity
for being a pain in the ass.

28:01.563 --> 28:03.934
I'm not gonna jump you,
you homophobe.

28:07.651 --> 28:10.937
- Damn janitors!
- You should try paying them.

28:11.113 --> 28:14.398
That's exactly my point. Instead of
trying to understand my problems...

28:14.574 --> 28:16.614
...you immediately champion
the opposition.

28:16.910 --> 28:19.151
- The janitors?
- Whoever. Peter, look.

28:19.370 --> 28:22.287
If I'm gonna give you a faculty
position, I've gotta be sure...

28:22.456 --> 28:24.828
...you're gonna be part of the team.
My team.

28:25.000 --> 28:26.578
- Of course.
- Of course what?

28:31.173 --> 28:32.999
Of course I'll be a part of the team.

28:35.009 --> 28:39.172
Then I can expect your full commitment?
No whining, no complaining...

28:39.347 --> 28:43.426
...no excuses about your kid
or your cat or whatever?

28:43.600 --> 28:45.059
I don't have a cat.

28:45.227 --> 28:46.769
Splendid. You're hired.

28:46.937 --> 28:50.021
Congratulations. You are a free man,
delivered from the shackles...

28:50.190 --> 28:51.933
...of your Residency and fellowship.

28:52.108 --> 28:54.480
- Dry your hands first.
- Yeah, right.

28:56.112 --> 28:58.437
Oh, well. Wasn't me.

29:09.624 --> 29:12.411
You selfish son of a bitch.

29:12.626 --> 29:14.619
- Well, hello, Abby.
- Is this fun for you?

29:14.795 --> 29:17.286
Or is it like an addiction?
Do you wake up thinking:

29:17.464 --> 29:19.622
"How am I gonna screw Abby today? "

29:19.800 --> 29:21.507
Okay. What's the problem?

29:21.718 --> 29:24.007
I lost three months of
school I can't make up...

29:24.220 --> 29:27.803
...three months that put me exactly
one year behind on my Residency.

29:27.974 --> 29:30.346
- This is about your tuition.
- Yes, it is.

29:30.810 --> 29:32.387
Calm down. I was gonna call you.

29:32.561 --> 29:35.182
The IRS disallowed our '97
home-office deduction.

29:35.355 --> 29:40.230
- I don't want one more lame excuse-
- They were gonna hit us with a penalty.

29:40.401 --> 29:44.185
This was important to me.
And you knew it, so you ruined it.

29:44.363 --> 29:45.561
Can you be more dramatic?

29:45.906 --> 29:48.777
I put you through med school.
You were gonna put me-

29:48.993 --> 29:52.361
You did not put me through med school.
My student loans did.

29:52.579 --> 29:56.197
- I only fed, clothed, sheltered you.
- Loans I'm still paying, along with...

29:56.416 --> 30:01.042
- ...a house, your condo and two cars.
- And the apartment for the whore.

30:01.754 --> 30:04.423
I assume you're cheating on
the whore with another whore.

30:04.590 --> 30:06.463
- All right, just stop it.
- You stop it.

30:06.800 --> 30:08.294
Haven't you done enough already?

30:08.510 --> 30:11.677
I didn't make you unhappy,
depressed and miserable.

30:11.846 --> 30:13.424
You did that all by yourself.

30:16.100 --> 30:18.140
- Screw you, Richard.
- Right. Screw me.

30:18.311 --> 30:19.935
- That's right. Screw you.
- Screw me.

30:20.104 --> 30:21.479
Screw you!

30:21.647 --> 30:23.639
You're the one who wanted more.

30:23.816 --> 30:25.855
You're a manipulative,
cheating, spineless...

30:26.026 --> 30:29.560
- You decided to change your life.
- ...spiteful ass!

30:31.114 --> 30:32.312
- Are you done?
- No.

30:32.490 --> 30:35.526
You're in violation of our divorce
agreement. I am hiring a lawyer...

30:35.701 --> 30:37.195
...and I am getting my tuition money.

30:37.411 --> 30:39.534
Do me a favor.
Why don't you take it all?

30:39.705 --> 30:41.781
Take the debt with it.

30:42.332 --> 30:43.874
Shut up, jag-off.

30:49.213 --> 30:51.206
- Hey, Nat.
- Hey, Dr. Benton.

30:51.382 --> 30:53.754
- Still plugging away?
- You know it.

30:54.760 --> 30:57.132
- What are you doing?
- Go the other way, would you?

30:57.346 --> 31:01.094
- Yeah. Nat, I'm late, man.
- The news is here.

31:05.019 --> 31:08.720
- All right, brother. Good luck.
- Thanks.

31:09.857 --> 31:10.936
Chen?

31:11.108 --> 31:12.271
I'm on break.

31:12.443 --> 31:14.150
Right.

31:18.490 --> 31:19.521
You all right?

31:20.158 --> 31:22.115
Yeah. Yeah.

31:23.411 --> 31:26.080
Good, you're still here.
We got a mass "cas" coming in.

31:26.247 --> 31:29.034
- Riot at a high school football game.
- I was just leaving-

31:29.208 --> 31:30.916
Not anymore.

31:43.054 --> 31:46.303
Blunt abdominal trauma. BP's low
at 90 palp. Give two liters of saline.

31:46.473 --> 31:47.848
- What happened?
- Bleachers fell.

31:48.016 --> 31:50.056
Give two units O-neg.
Draw pre-op labs.

31:50.227 --> 31:51.258
- Ultrasound?
- You bet.

31:51.436 --> 31:53.974
Also, page me if anything changes.
All right, go.

31:54.147 --> 31:57.101
Drop an NG, check his urine,
shoot a chest and pelvis.

31:57.275 --> 31:59.066
Sorry.

31:59.235 --> 32:04.774
The game was too ugly.
Refs called it before the end.

32:04.948 --> 32:06.775
And everybody just started swinging.

32:06.950 --> 32:08.278
- You okay, Cleo?
- Yeah.

32:08.451 --> 32:11.618
Doc. They need you. Damn kids
jumped a teacher in the parking lot.

32:11.788 --> 32:14.113
Head trauma, maybe a collapsed lung.

32:14.290 --> 32:17.291
Short of breath. BP, 110/70.
Pulse, 120.

32:17.460 --> 32:20.164
- Mitch, do you have pain in your chest?
- It hurts.

32:20.337 --> 32:24.548
Titrate another six of morphine.
Page Ortho and Vascular.

32:24.716 --> 32:27.385
Elizabeth, why are you here?
I thought you'd be operating.

32:27.552 --> 32:28.963
Mitch? What happened?

32:29.137 --> 32:30.761
They're backed up.

32:30.847 --> 32:33.598
Rooms are empty but
filthy because of this work stoppage.

32:33.766 --> 32:34.928
- Really?
- You doing okay?

32:35.100 --> 32:37.591
- They got to operate. But who won?
- Where are we going?

32:37.769 --> 32:38.801
Nobody.

32:38.979 --> 32:41.137
Try an Exam Room.
Get an EKG, chest x-ray...

32:41.314 --> 32:44.481
.. and find me when the femur film's up.
How long before you get into O.R.?

32:44.651 --> 32:47.817
The nurses are cleaning but there's
a leaking triple-A going first.

32:47.987 --> 32:50.692
We're gonna keep him down
here and do a pericardiocentesis.

32:50.865 --> 32:53.355
All this so Housekeeping
doesn't get an extra dollar.

32:53.534 --> 32:56.985
- I don't need the operation anymore?
- You just have to wait a little longer.

32:57.162 --> 32:58.193
Hang in there.

32:58.371 --> 33:00.743
You chucked my guy with your helmet.
Don't whine.

33:00.915 --> 33:02.493
- Hold still.
- You did it on purpose.

33:02.667 --> 33:05.833
- You want some more?
- Hold still or I'll put you in restraints.

33:06.003 --> 33:08.708
- What did they hit you with?
- The pavement.

33:08.881 --> 33:12.546
- Frank. Frank, what's open?
- Nothing. Nothing's open.

33:16.888 --> 33:20.553
I can't believe this.
I mean, it's just a game.

33:20.725 --> 33:22.219
Is the nurse taking me up?

33:22.393 --> 33:25.014
We're gonna have to drain some
of the blood down here.

33:25.187 --> 33:26.930
You said he was going to Surgery.

33:27.106 --> 33:30.142
But it can take a while to prep
and drape and anesthetize him.

33:30.317 --> 33:32.523
His cardiac echo shows the
effusion's grown...

33:32.694 --> 33:35.149
Crush injury at 70 palp,
despite a fluid bolus.

33:35.321 --> 33:38.026
- Respiratory status?
- Intubated for agonal respirations.

33:38.199 --> 33:41.982
Two units of O-neg on the rapid infuser.
Set up a supraumbilical peritoneal lavage.

33:42.161 --> 33:43.192
I'm never gonna leave.

33:43.370 --> 33:46.122
- Pulse 140. Satted at 92.
- Hey, med student, what's your name?

33:46.289 --> 33:49.124
- Ryan Bradford.
- Ryan, get over here. I need your help.

33:52.545 --> 33:54.123
That's not so bad.

33:54.297 --> 33:58.875
This is the little needle
to numb you for the big needle.

33:59.718 --> 34:04.380
- But you're a tough guy. You can take it.
- BP's 90.

34:05.974 --> 34:10.719
- I can't believe all this started over me.
- You're a popular guy.

34:10.895 --> 34:12.092
He looks so pale.

34:12.271 --> 34:15.770
Mrs. Palmieri, perhaps you should
wait outside during the actual procedure.

34:15.940 --> 34:20.235
- I can't stay?
- I'm okay, Mom. Just a little tired.

34:20.404 --> 34:22.360
- Haleh?
- This way, ma'am.

34:22.530 --> 34:26.658
- I love you.
- I love you too, Mom.

34:30.913 --> 34:33.237
Alligator clip.

34:37.085 --> 34:38.911
He's in tamponade, Mark.

34:39.087 --> 34:40.996
I know. Mike, how are you feeling?

34:41.172 --> 34:42.583
Pulse ox down to 78.

34:43.091 --> 34:44.501
Mike?

34:44.675 --> 34:46.632
Mike? Mike, open your eyes.

34:46.802 --> 34:48.795
8-0 ET tube. I'll intubate.

34:49.138 --> 34:52.589
- He's still breathing.
- Not for long.

34:53.433 --> 34:57.383
- Just keep an eye on the injury current.
- Just get that needle in.

35:18.956 --> 35:20.913
Dr. Carter? Are you Dr. Carter?

35:21.083 --> 35:23.788
- Yeah.
- I'm Ryan Bradford. I'm a third-year.

35:23.961 --> 35:27.329
The ER got slammed and Dr. Benton
asked me to come pick you up.

35:27.506 --> 35:28.916
- Great.
- Need a hand with that?

35:29.090 --> 35:31.961
- No, no. I got it.
- Okay. Right this way.

35:32.135 --> 35:34.257
- Where you going?
- Pre-op. He needs an ex-lap.

35:34.428 --> 35:36.836
- There's no room.
- He's stable. He can wait upstairs.

35:37.014 --> 35:38.592
- What's his BP?
- BP's 140/60.

35:38.766 --> 35:41.802
- All right. Grab the head injury in 3.
- Malik. You got this?

35:41.977 --> 35:44.135
Yeah, I got it. Go on.

35:48.191 --> 35:50.148
Hey, sir?

35:50.318 --> 35:54.564
Sir, are you all right? Sir?

35:56.407 --> 36:00.451
Malik. I need a gurney now.

36:04.330 --> 36:07.948
Oh, my God. Malik.

36:09.126 --> 36:10.620
- You. Come here.
- What'd I do?

36:10.795 --> 36:14.495
Help me move this man.
Now. Come on.

36:17.634 --> 36:21.501
Sats are up to 92.
You want me to try?

36:21.679 --> 36:25.428
No. He has weird anatomy.
I have to go more anterior.

36:25.600 --> 36:27.473
I should be there.

36:27.643 --> 36:30.560
- Run of five. Pull back.
- Pressure's dropping down to 70.

36:30.729 --> 36:32.271
Give him another liter of saline.

36:32.439 --> 36:34.681
Look at the monitor.
Profound ST elevation.

36:34.858 --> 36:37.527
- Damn it. He's having an Ml.
- More PVCs.

36:37.694 --> 36:41.738
A hundred of lidocaine. You must
have transected the coronary artery.

36:41.906 --> 36:43.982
No, no, no, no, no.

36:44.158 --> 36:47.527
It's a known complication.
You went in blind. Prep the chest.

36:47.703 --> 36:51.118
- He should be upstairs right now.
- Mark.

36:51.540 --> 36:53.164
Thoracotomy tray.

36:54.709 --> 36:57.034
- What happened?
- He swallowed a whole pharmacy.

36:57.211 --> 37:00.545
I found empty bottles of Elavil,
codeine and lorazepam.

37:00.714 --> 37:03.205
- Did you give him Narcan?
- Yeah. Two mgs times two.

37:03.384 --> 37:06.053
Sats are dropping.
Resps eight and shallow.

37:06.219 --> 37:09.505
Add an amp of bicarb.
Chem-7, CBC and a tox screen.

37:09.681 --> 37:12.385
- Yeah, I'm in. Who's Florence?
- What?

37:12.558 --> 37:14.467
Well, the pills say "Florence. "

37:14.644 --> 37:16.720
His wife. She died this afternoon.

37:16.896 --> 37:20.727
Pericardium's tight as a drum. Metz.

37:24.319 --> 37:28.566
- Okay. Start internal compressions.
- Need suction in here.

37:28.740 --> 37:30.364
We've got a crowd.

37:30.533 --> 37:33.652
Someone close the blinds.
Can you see anything?

37:33.828 --> 37:35.820
Sponge stick.

37:38.165 --> 37:41.249
Right there. Laceration of the L.A.D.

37:41.418 --> 37:43.494
- Can you repair it?
- Not without bypass.

37:43.670 --> 37:45.911
You got to do something.
I am not losing him.

37:46.089 --> 37:50.335
- Right. Open some sterile IV tubing.
- The blinds, now.

37:51.385 --> 37:54.255
I don't know how you guys do
it every day. It's intense.

37:54.429 --> 37:57.596
You sure get to do a lot.
You know, you just jump right in.

37:57.766 --> 37:59.924
I was interested in surgery.
But I don't know.

38:00.101 --> 38:01.679
Maybe the ER's my thing.

38:02.103 --> 38:06.147
I guess if today's any indication,
there's never a dull moment, huh?

38:06.941 --> 38:09.182
Yeah, right.

38:09.360 --> 38:12.479
Tubing's in. There.

38:13.864 --> 38:16.022
Hold compressions.

38:16.199 --> 38:19.283
- He's in V-fib.
- Charge internal paddles to 15.

38:19.452 --> 38:21.444
Charging.

38:23.789 --> 38:25.947
Clear.

38:27.543 --> 38:29.582
Still in V-fib.

38:29.753 --> 38:32.125
Charge to 30.

38:36.009 --> 38:38.250
Haleh.

38:39.220 --> 38:41.129
Clear.

38:41.305 --> 38:43.381
- Another amp of epi.
- Charge again.

38:43.557 --> 38:45.763
50 of lidocaine.
Start a drip at two per minute.

38:45.934 --> 38:46.965
Clear!

38:48.895 --> 38:51.516
- Still in Torsade.
- Three-sixty. Magnesium on board?

38:51.689 --> 38:53.812
That's four grams.
Isuprel's pouring in.

38:53.983 --> 38:55.311
Clear.

38:56.485 --> 38:57.861
Asystole.

38:58.028 --> 39:00.484
It's the tricyclics.
We'll never get a rhythm back.

39:00.656 --> 39:03.775
Maybe we could try overdrive pacing.

39:04.242 --> 39:08.109
No. He's been down too long.

39:08.288 --> 39:13.827
That's it. Time of death, 19:54.

39:14.001 --> 39:18.461
Take him downstairs.
Make sure he's put beside his wife.

39:18.630 --> 39:21.038
You guys done?
I've got a stab wound to the thigh.

39:21.216 --> 39:23.458
Yeah, we are done.

39:28.764 --> 39:32.050
Come on, Mike. Come on.

39:32.601 --> 39:35.174
- How many units of blood?
- Six so far.

39:35.354 --> 39:37.642
The heart's filling well.
He's not hypovolemic.

39:37.814 --> 39:40.139
- When was the last epi?
- Three minutes.

39:40.316 --> 39:43.685
- He's had two of atropine?
- Both amps are in.

39:43.861 --> 39:46.067
Someone should prep the mother.

39:46.238 --> 39:48.610
- Dopamine's wide open?
- For the last five minutes.

39:48.782 --> 39:50.905
- Son of a bitch.
- Mark.

39:51.076 --> 39:53.033
Let's keep going.

39:53.370 --> 39:55.611
You want me to talk to her?

39:56.498 --> 39:59.498
No. I should do it.

39:59.709 --> 40:01.536
Chen.

40:04.547 --> 40:07.631
Can you come take over
chest compressions?

40:08.884 --> 40:11.719
Okay. Let's go again
with the paddles.

40:11.887 --> 40:14.377
Charge to 30.

40:17.517 --> 40:19.224
Clear.

40:20.644 --> 40:23.515
- Hey, man, what's going on?
- Is he dying?

40:23.689 --> 40:26.725
What's happening to him?
Hey, come on.

40:26.900 --> 40:29.355
He's our friend.

40:33.197 --> 40:36.068
Someone said you had to shock him.
Is that true?

40:36.242 --> 40:39.361
We've had some complications.

40:39.536 --> 40:41.493
What kind of complications?

40:42.039 --> 40:44.031
The needle poked a hole
in the artery...

40:44.207 --> 40:48.703
...that supplies the blood
and oxygen to Mike's heart...

40:48.878 --> 40:51.748
...which caused him
to have a heart attack.

40:52.923 --> 40:55.758
We opened up his chest
to repair the artery.

40:55.926 --> 40:57.919
But his heart has been deprived
of oxygen...

40:58.137 --> 41:00.259
...for too long
and it wasn't beating.

41:00.430 --> 41:01.759
Oh, my God.

41:02.140 --> 41:06.090
We' re giving him intravenous drugs
and shocking his heart.

41:06.728 --> 41:09.218
- There's been no response.
- What does that mean?

41:09.563 --> 41:12.054
- What does that mean?!
- We might not get him back.

41:12.233 --> 41:15.732
- What?
- He could die.

41:18.238 --> 41:21.523
But you said that this
was a simple procedure...

41:21.699 --> 41:24.451
...that he would be fine.

41:24.619 --> 41:26.113
That he would sail through this.

41:26.287 --> 41:30.783
I know. I know, Mrs. Palmieri.
This is an exceedingly rare complication.

41:31.208 --> 41:36.450
I don't care. I don't care.
You fix him. You fix my son.

41:36.629 --> 41:37.958
- We'll try.
- No.

41:38.131 --> 41:39.459
But...

41:39.632 --> 41:41.541
You promised me.

41:41.717 --> 41:44.469
I have to go back.

41:46.138 --> 41:48.047
You promised me.

41:48.223 --> 41:50.796
- Is he gonna be all right?
- We're working on him.

41:50.976 --> 41:54.095
- You gotta give us room.
- Everybody back up. Back up, guys.

41:54.270 --> 41:55.468
Let the doctor through.

41:55.647 --> 41:58.813
- Still in V-fib. Sats are dropping.
- Carotid pulse with compressions.

41:58.983 --> 42:00.643
Clear.

42:00.901 --> 42:02.977
- Anything?
- No.

42:03.153 --> 42:05.229
Again. How long are
we going to go?

42:05.405 --> 42:07.445
Until I say stop.

42:07.616 --> 42:09.074
Clear.

42:09.242 --> 42:10.820
We're out of epi.

42:10.994 --> 42:14.991
Chen, I want you to
go get some epi.

42:15.164 --> 42:16.445
Sure.

42:16.624 --> 42:19.162
Crash cart Curtain 3.

42:19.335 --> 42:21.244
Clear.

42:23.422 --> 42:24.916
Excuse me.

42:25.090 --> 42:27.213
The doctor told Mike's mom
he was gonna die.

42:42.105 --> 42:43.385
Hey.

42:54.700 --> 42:56.858
Malucci.

43:05.710 --> 43:07.832
You okay?

43:08.003 --> 43:11.538
Stop it. Let it go!
Let it go! Stop it!

43:14.718 --> 43:16.461
Break it up. Break it up. Get off.

43:19.639 --> 43:22.758
Security.
We've got a problem down here!

43:34.903 --> 43:36.231
What is going on out there?

43:36.404 --> 43:37.946
They just started fighting.

43:38.114 --> 43:40.320
Clear.

43:42.117 --> 43:43.493
- Chen, are you okay?
- Yeah.

43:43.661 --> 43:45.071
- Are you okay?
- Mark. Mark.

43:45.245 --> 43:48.080
- What?
- A rhythm. We've got a rhythm.

44:00.759 --> 44:03.428
- What's that?
- I don't know.

44:03.595 --> 44:06.264
- I better get back. You coming in?
- No. I'm gonna go home.

44:06.431 --> 44:09.385
- Hey, well, it was good to meet you.
- Thank you.
