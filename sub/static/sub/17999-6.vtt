00:01.755 --> 00:04.022
What's your favorite
superhero tv show?

00:04.024 --> 00:05.391
- Superhero tv show?
- What did you like?

00:05.425 --> 00:06.959
There was, uh,
<i>Birds of Prey,</i> which--

00:06.994 --> 00:08.961
Short-lived.

00:08.962 --> 00:11.731
Very short-lived
and rightly seld.

00:11.765 --> 00:13.799
'cause it sucked.

00:16.236 --> 00:17.536
What about the <i>Batman</i>
tv show,

00:17.571 --> 00:18.804
The 1966 <i>Batman</i> series?

00:18.839 --> 00:20.573
What a show, man.

00:20.607 --> 00:22.074
Every episode,
they were getting down,

00:22.109 --> 00:24.777
Throwing punches,
doing elaborate back flips

00:24.811 --> 00:27.079
With robin on batman's back
as he swung him around

00:27.114 --> 00:28.681
And was kicking like this.

00:28.715 --> 00:30.349
And that was just
the bedroom scenes.

01:08.455 --> 01:10.756
Hello and welcome to another
episode of <i>Comic Book Men,</i>

01:10.791 --> 01:13.992
The only show that's broadcast
directly from the negative zone.

01:14.010 --> 01:15.428
I'm Kevin Smith.

01:15.462 --> 01:16.996
- Bryan Johnson.
- Walt Flanagan.

01:17.030 --> 01:18.864
- Mike Zapcic.
- Ming Chen.

01:18.865 --> 01:19.832
What's been happening this week?

01:19.866 --> 01:21.167
Enlighten us.

01:21.201 --> 01:22.835
Really,
one of the most oddball items

01:22.869 --> 01:24.470
Came through the door.
- Really?

01:24.504 --> 01:26.672
And when I say "oddball,"
I literally mean ball.

01:29.909 --> 01:32.011
- Thank you.
- Enjoy.

01:32.045 --> 01:34.046
- How's it going?
- Hi, how you doing?

01:34.080 --> 01:36.816
Hi. Got some stuff
I'm looking to sell.

01:36.850 --> 01:38.517
We don't do
sports collectibles.

01:38.552 --> 01:42.187
Well, it's signed by most
of the <i>Batman</i> tv show cast.

01:42.205 --> 01:43.756
Batman baseball?

01:50.831 --> 01:52.248
I mean, this ball is badass.

01:52.299 --> 01:53.466
Two Catwomen.

01:53.500 --> 01:55.301
- Burgess Meredith, the Penguin.
- The penguin.

01:55.335 --> 01:57.970
Gorshin, the Riddler.
Burt ward, Robin.

01:58.004 --> 02:00.372
- I mean, who else is on here?
- Adam West and Art Carney.

02:00.406 --> 02:01.640
Oh, my God!

02:01.675 --> 02:03.909
What a show, man.
I love it.

02:03.944 --> 02:05.611
I wanted it, 'cause I had
never seen it before.

02:05.645 --> 02:07.480
And I thought it would
look great in the store.

02:07.514 --> 02:09.181
So I had called Rob Bruce in.

02:09.216 --> 02:11.851
Rob bruce is our resident
pop culturalist

02:11.885 --> 02:14.453
Who Walter calls on
at all times

02:14.488 --> 02:17.706
To validate items,
to evaluate them,

02:17.758 --> 02:19.225
To tell us more about them.

02:19.259 --> 02:21.193
He's a Batman
of useless facts.

02:22.796 --> 02:24.697
- Robert, check this out.
- Wow.

02:24.731 --> 02:26.081
A baseball.

02:26.116 --> 02:29.368
Signed by the cast
of the 1966 <i>Batman</i> tv show.

02:29.402 --> 02:31.737
Wow!
Is it for sale?

02:31.772 --> 02:33.405
It's for sale.

02:33.440 --> 02:34.907
All these signatures
on a baseball?

02:34.941 --> 02:37.810
There's probably not
two of these in the world.

02:37.811 --> 02:39.578
This is never gonna walk
through

02:39.613 --> 02:42.581
It's easy enough to get Adam West
and Burt Ward's autographs.

02:42.582 --> 02:44.483
But some of the guys passed .

02:44.517 --> 02:46.652
Art Carney is like
really rare.

02:46.686 --> 02:48.487
But I mean,
it's still a baseball.

02:48.522 --> 02:49.822
It's a really odd thing.

02:49.856 --> 02:52.057
Some of the signatures
are very common obviously.

02:52.092 --> 02:54.326
And some of are still alive.

02:54.344 --> 02:56.712
So you can go out
and get Yvonne Craig's autograph

02:56.713 --> 02:59.098
At the next convention.

02:59.132 --> 03:00.783
Okay, what would you pay
for it?

03:00.817 --> 03:02.434
I'd like to pay half
of whatever the ball's worth.

03:02.452 --> 03:06.172
I think the ball's
probably worth $350, $400 retail.

03:06.206 --> 03:07.439
Call me if you need me.

03:07.474 --> 03:09.308
- Thank you, Robert.
- Thanks.

03:09.342 --> 03:10.475
Let's talk baseball.

03:12.579 --> 03:14.814
Would you do $275?

03:14.848 --> 03:16.882
$275, I'll take it right now.

03:16.917 --> 03:20.986
I would go, uh,
$250 and a t-shirt.

03:21.021 --> 03:22.354
Hell yeah!

03:22.388 --> 03:24.790
Hell yeah!

03:24.825 --> 03:26.892
You got a deal.
Whened?

03:32.132 --> 03:33.668
Hey, Walt.

03:33.669 --> 03:35.669
I need you to switch
saturdays with me.

03:35.702 --> 03:37.203
Why?

03:37.237 --> 03:39.638
We're gonna be doing
a zombie run.

03:39.673 --> 03:41.874
It's a 5k...

03:41.908 --> 03:45.110
And your chased by people
who dress up like zombies.

03:45.145 --> 03:46.579
We're gonna be raising
some money

03:46.613 --> 03:49.348
For Kevin's charity
Wayne Foundation.

03:49.382 --> 03:56.021
We got a little charity
called the Wayne Foundation.

03:56.056 --> 03:58.490
And you guys ran on behalf
of the Wayne Foundation.

03:58.508 --> 03:59.959
- We did.
- Where was the race?

03:59.993 --> 04:01.327
It was outside
of Pittsburgh.

04:01.361 --> 04:02.645
Right.

04:02.696 --> 04:05.114
Now that means something
to those of us

04:05.148 --> 04:06.782
Who are geeks,

04:06.816 --> 04:08.701
Because Pittsburgh
is birthplace

04:08.735 --> 04:10.035
Of the zombie movement.

04:10.070 --> 04:12.271
George Romero,
the dead master,

04:12.305 --> 04:14.773
Shot <i>Night of the Living Dead</i>
right nearPittsburgh.

04:14.808 --> 04:17.375
So to be
in Western Pennsylvania,

04:17.410 --> 04:19.295
Running away from zombies,

04:19.346 --> 04:21.413
That almost puts you
in <i>Night of the Living Dead.</i>

04:21.447 --> 04:23.115
How awesome is this?

04:23.149 --> 04:24.617
Rather than
a start-to-finish race,

04:24.651 --> 04:27.486
Where, you know, you just run
from one end to the other,

04:27.520 --> 04:28.904
You're getting chased
by bloodthirsty zombies.

04:28.955 --> 04:30.422
It's an obstacle course too.

04:30.440 --> 04:33.092
Over walls
or climbing over cargo nets.

04:33.126 --> 04:34.260
Do either of these guys
strike you

04:34.294 --> 04:35.844
As being able to do parkour

04:35.879 --> 04:39.098
Or run like military-style
obstacle courses?

04:39.132 --> 04:41.734
Now I know you run
quite a bit all the time.

04:41.768 --> 04:43.669
But you, sir,
mr. Zapcic,

04:43.703 --> 04:45.170
I've heard of a tale

04:45.205 --> 04:46.639
Of you being Wally West,
Barry Allen,

04:46.673 --> 04:48.641
Fleeting around
like the Flash, man.

04:48.675 --> 04:51.010
You're not much of a runner.
- Nope. Not eved.

04:51.044 --> 04:53.012
That's what I thought of
when I thought of this race.

04:53.046 --> 04:55.097
I see a lot of people
out there like,

04:55.131 --> 04:56.748
"Yeah, man, I'm into zombies
and everything."

04:56.766 --> 04:58.684
And these people
haven't run a race

04:58.718 --> 05:00.853
- Since gym class.
- Yes!

05:00.887 --> 05:03.656
Four steps
and they're like, "Oh!"

05:03.690 --> 05:07.026
I'm gonna be a zombie.

05:07.060 --> 05:09.061
I think not only
can you run it and finish it,

05:09.095 --> 05:10.462
I think you can win it.

05:10.497 --> 05:12.631
I'm just worried
about Mike though.

05:12.666 --> 05:14.600
Don't want anybody at the
Stash to be embarrassed here.

05:14.634 --> 05:15.918
I'm a little past
my prime,

05:15.952 --> 05:18.237
But I'll bet you
I could help you guys train.

05:18.271 --> 05:19.555
Yeah, I'll be alongside
training with you.

05:19.589 --> 05:20.723
I need you in shape.

05:20.757 --> 05:21.940
Like I don't want you
to be like,

05:21.958 --> 05:23.609
"No, just leave me!
Just leave me here!"

05:23.643 --> 05:25.227
I don't want you going
all C-3PO on me.

05:26.779 --> 05:28.330
I'm gonna hobble your ass,

05:28.381 --> 05:31.550
So the zombies can get you
while I can run.

05:31.584 --> 05:34.386
I have something you may not
have seen for over 20 years.

05:34.421 --> 05:36.388
Someone just popped
my nerdgasm.

05:36.423 --> 05:37.473
Yeah!

05:37.507 --> 05:39.191
Gimme some jumping jacks!

05:49.090 --> 05:50.723
If you were like,
"Hey, man,

05:50.758 --> 05:54.861
My entire childhood
is summed up in this one movie,"

05:54.895 --> 05:57.147
You know, as a kid, movies
were not that big a deal to me.

05:57.181 --> 05:58.631
I was reading comics.

05:58.666 --> 06:01.618
But there's a movie for you
that defines your childhood.

06:01.652 --> 06:03.503
- Mm-hmm.
- What would that movie be?

06:03.537 --> 06:04.571
<i>Bad News Bears.</i>

06:04.605 --> 06:07.540
Not a bad movie.

06:07.575 --> 06:09.976
Stof the times.

06:10.010 --> 06:12.479
Like, when they remade it,
nothing like it.

06:12.513 --> 06:14.931
None of the cursing,
none of the offensive stuff.

06:14.965 --> 06:18.384
I think that
you're pining for a time

06:18.419 --> 06:19.669
That's never gonna come back--

06:19.720 --> 06:21.921
When you could give beer to kids
and not get arrested.

06:21.956 --> 06:23.356
Everything doesn't come back
eventually?

06:23.374 --> 06:25.792
Driving drunk in a convertible

06:25.826 --> 06:27.794
With the kids sitting up
on the back.

06:27.828 --> 06:29.329
- Hey, how you doing?
- I'm fine.

06:29.363 --> 06:30.964
What can we do
for you today?

06:30.998 --> 06:32.198
I think I have something
you may not have seen

06:32.233 --> 06:37.203
For over 20 years.

06:37.238 --> 06:39.806
Which came out in 1989.

06:46.947 --> 06:50.016
Now, that's a movie!
<i>Batman,</i> 1989.

06:50.050 --> 06:52.919
When <i>Batman</i> came out, I had
to own everything Batman.

06:52.953 --> 06:56.656
It was like someone just
popped my nerdgasm, you know?

06:56.690 --> 07:00.460
I--

07:00.494 --> 07:04.697
So eloquent.
I love your phrasing.

07:04.732 --> 07:05.698
Do you remember
the first night

07:05.716 --> 07:06.833
We all went to see
this movie?

07:06.867 --> 07:09.002
- Yes.
- We saw it in the big theater,

07:09.036 --> 07:11.404
And it was packed, and people
were going absolutely nuts.

07:11.438 --> 07:13.590
And it was like
a representation of Batman,

07:13.624 --> 07:15.074
And finally you were, like,
"Oh...

07:15.092 --> 07:17.977
"this legitimizes everything
that I've stood for

07:18.012 --> 07:19.546
My whole life!"

07:19.580 --> 07:21.347
It doesn't hold up, though.

07:21.381 --> 07:22.715
When was the last time
you watched it?

07:22.750 --> 07:25.852
Sad to say.

07:25.886 --> 07:28.688
How do you keep
a box of cereal sealed

07:28.706 --> 07:33.226
And in this king of shape
for that long?

07:33.260 --> 07:34.427
Because I had it
in my dorm room.

07:34.461 --> 07:36.162
You were in college
when Batman came out?

07:36.197 --> 07:38.831
In '89, which is amazing
how that never got eaten.

07:38.866 --> 07:40.099
'cause I had some roommates
who would

07:40.134 --> 07:41.701
Come home late at night,

07:41.735 --> 07:42.819
And they'd have the munchies,

07:42.853 --> 07:46.206
And I was able
to keep it away from them.

07:46.240 --> 07:48.841
After midnight after they get
that grass in them?

07:50.444 --> 07:51.711
All right, well,
what are you looking for

07:51.745 --> 07:53.213
For this box of cereal?

07:53.247 --> 07:54.197
I'm not asking for a lot.

07:54.248 --> 07:55.582
I was asking for, like, $50.

07:55.616 --> 08:02.355
Did you have some leftover
weed from college too?

08:02.389 --> 08:04.757
I got a box of Batman cereal
in 1989.

08:04.792 --> 08:06.910
I got the one
with the Batman bank

08:06.961 --> 08:08.494
Shrink-wrapped
to the front of the box.

08:08.528 --> 08:09.662
Where's the Batman bank?

08:09.696 --> 08:13.833
If you want $50,
where's that bank?

08:13.867 --> 08:15.368
Or maybe,
when I was 21 years old,

08:15.402 --> 08:16.769
I couldn't afford the one
with the Batman bank on it.

08:16.804 --> 08:18.471
It was the same price
as this one.

08:18.505 --> 08:19.672
I--they didn't have it.

08:19.707 --> 08:21.541
I'll give you $10
for it.

08:21.575 --> 08:22.809
I'd say $30.

08:22.843 --> 08:25.077
It'd be a great
conversational piece.

08:25.295 --> 08:27.048
How about $25?

08:27.049 --> 08:28.449
I'll put it right up there.

08:28.483 --> 08:31.818
Where it will remain
at the stash indefinitely.

08:31.852 --> 08:32.936
I will take that deal

08:32.986 --> 08:34.187
Because I know
it has a home here.

08:34.221 --> 08:36.688
All right, man,
you got a deal.

08:36.724 --> 08:37.789
All right.

08:37.825 --> 08:39.359
- There you go.
- Thank you.

08:39.393 --> 08:40.927
It's been a pleasure.
- Have a great afternoon.

08:40.961 --> 08:42.061
Thank you.

08:42.096 --> 08:43.895
I remember it tasted

08:43.931 --> 08:47.100
And had the texture
of a cap'n crunch.

08:47.134 --> 08:48.234
I don't remember,

08:48.252 --> 08:49.669
But somebody at this table
may remember.

08:49.703 --> 08:51.738
Uh, yeah.

08:51.772 --> 08:54.841
Wait, you didn't eat
collector cereal, did you?

08:54.875 --> 08:56.809
What you're doing?

08:56.844 --> 08:58.444
Let's try it out.

08:58.479 --> 09:00.380
You do realize that this is,
like, almost antique?

09:00.414 --> 09:02.081
I just want to try,
like, half a bowl.

09:02.116 --> 09:03.149
- Really?
- Yeah.

09:03.183 --> 09:04.450
Crack it open.

09:04.485 --> 09:06.119
All right, all right.

09:06.153 --> 09:07.287
- What's it look like?
- You know what?

09:07.321 --> 09:11.157
It doesn't look that bad.

09:11.191 --> 09:12.291
Oh, that's the sweet spot.

09:12.309 --> 09:13.760
All right, perfect.
No, that's good.

09:13.794 --> 09:15.695
- All right, are you ready?
- Does it matter if I'm ready?

09:15.729 --> 09:18.097
All that matters is
if you're ready.

09:27.441 --> 09:29.609
It really is stale.
It's stale.

09:29.643 --> 09:31.844
It was a good year, '89.

09:31.879 --> 09:34.013
Five-spot to do
the Gremlin walk.

09:34.048 --> 09:37.650
Prepare to have
your minds blown.

09:37.685 --> 09:38.851
What the hell?

09:38.886 --> 09:40.136
It's a zombie run,
not a zombie walk!

09:43.748 --> 09:45.599
Around '99, 2000,

09:45.633 --> 09:48.718
Action figure craze exploded

09:48.753 --> 09:50.253
In the world of collectors

09:50.288 --> 09:51.338
Because they finally
figured out

09:51.389 --> 09:52.722
How to make action figures

09:52.757 --> 09:57.460
That look like your favorite
characters in the comics.

09:57.495 --> 09:58.795
I mean, it was a sickness.

09:58.829 --> 10:01.998
I literally couldn't pass
a chain retail store

10:02.033 --> 10:03.566
Without going in.

10:03.601 --> 10:04.935
You're diseased!

10:04.969 --> 10:07.203
You need help, Walter.

10:07.238 --> 10:10.874
My addiction got so bad
that I would talk

10:10.908 --> 10:12.976
In these big stores,
and I'd be, like,

10:13.010 --> 10:16.046
"Hey, man, if you ever know
when a truck's coming in,

10:16.080 --> 10:18.248
"Um, I'll give you my number,
you can give me a call.

10:18.282 --> 10:21.051
And, you know, maybe I'll give
you some-something for it."

10:21.085 --> 10:24.587
Legend has it, years after
this operation closed down,

10:24.622 --> 10:27.323
Somebody who worked there
came into our store

10:27.341 --> 10:29.592
And told Walter, like,
"you were legendary

10:29.627 --> 10:30.927
"where I worked.

10:30.962 --> 10:33.430
Every morning--"
- they had meetings, yeah.

10:33.464 --> 10:35.098
And they were, like,
If you see this person--

10:35.132 --> 10:40.170
"if you see this person's name,
is not allowed to shock here."

10:40.204 --> 10:45.108
Toy Story cowboy?

10:56.460 --> 10:59.279
Have they ever killed off
a major character

10:59.313 --> 11:02.033
And not brought him back
eventually?

11:02.067 --> 11:04.767
The only one that I can
think Peter Parker's Uncle Ben.

11:04.785 --> 11:06.969
You know why they can't
bring him back, right?

11:06.987 --> 11:08.104
Because then it negates
"With great power comes

11:08.138 --> 11:09.272
Great responsibility."

11:09.306 --> 11:10.690
Then he doesn't no longer need

11:10.741 --> 11:12.275
To be Spider-Man
no more.

11:12.309 --> 11:13.776
And why would you
bring back Uncle Ben?

11:13.811 --> 11:15.612
Why bring any character back?
For the almighty dollar.

11:15.646 --> 11:18.882
How big would that issue be?
Double poly bagged,

11:18.916 --> 11:19.983
With a pair of depends
for old people.

11:20.017 --> 11:21.851
Hey, guys, what's up?
How you doing?

11:21.886 --> 11:23.520
What can we do
for you today?

11:23.554 --> 11:26.072
I got this bad boy for you.
<i>Sheena</i> number two.

11:26.123 --> 11:27.190
Oh, my goodness.

11:34.899 --> 11:37.233
You got your gloves,
Mike?

11:37.268 --> 11:38.468
I do.
Let me go grab 'em.

11:38.502 --> 11:41.504
Bend over.

11:41.539 --> 11:43.506
So where'd you get this from?

11:43.541 --> 11:45.475
I basically got into a little
bit of juvenile trouble,

11:45.509 --> 11:47.109
They made me
go see a counselor.

11:47.127 --> 11:49.612
We hit it off, and he
gave it to me as a gift.

11:49.647 --> 11:51.447
What were you in for?

11:51.482 --> 11:53.616
I got caught drinking a little
airplane bottle of brandy

11:53.651 --> 11:55.185
In high school,
that was on a dare.

11:55.219 --> 11:56.920
I mean, were you
drinking it nude

11:56.954 --> 11:59.355
In a nursing home
or something?

11:59.389 --> 12:01.591
Be a better story
if I was.

12:01.625 --> 12:03.560
So the <i>Sheena</i> comic--
who drew it?

12:03.594 --> 12:07.163
It was credited to
one w. Morgan Yhomas.

12:07.197 --> 12:08.831
I don't know that name.

12:08.866 --> 12:11.234
But you'd know the name
that it really belonged to--

12:11.268 --> 12:13.002
- Will Eisner.
- Will Eisner drew the book?

12:13.037 --> 12:15.455
Under unassumed identity?

12:15.506 --> 12:18.708
Yeah. He had a talent house
back in the '40s,

12:18.726 --> 12:20.076
And he worked under
other names

12:20.110 --> 12:22.195
So it looked like he had
a bigger bullpen.

12:22.246 --> 12:24.447
He had a stable of people
working for him,

12:24.481 --> 12:27.550
But really, it was just him
under a different name.

12:27.585 --> 12:29.319
So what's it worth?

12:29.353 --> 12:32.155
Um, this,
in good condition,

12:32.189 --> 12:34.657
Is worth about $130.

12:34.692 --> 12:37.126
- Yeah.
- That's in good condition.

12:37.161 --> 12:41.064
This is a far cry.

12:41.098 --> 12:42.131
Water damage up top,

12:42.166 --> 12:44.617
Significant discoloring
of the pages,

12:44.652 --> 12:46.936
And flaking.

12:46.971 --> 12:48.504
What are you looking for
for this today?

12:48.539 --> 12:50.173
I'm looking for $100.

12:50.207 --> 12:52.125
$100?

12:52.176 --> 12:56.212
Well, he told you,
in better shape than this,

12:56.247 --> 12:57.914
How about $80?

12:57.948 --> 13:00.216
I couldn't do $80 on it.

13:00.251 --> 13:02.318
Like, I honestly don't know
if I could get

13:02.353 --> 13:04.187
More than $20 for this
in the store.

13:04.221 --> 13:09.759
How about $55,
and I do a walk for you

13:09.793 --> 13:11.411
What kind of walk is that?

13:11.445 --> 13:13.663
- It's the Gremlin walk.
- The Gremlin walk?

13:13.697 --> 13:14.964
Yeah, the Gremlin walk.

13:14.999 --> 13:17.066
How 'bout you keep
the comic,

13:17.101 --> 13:19.302
And I'll give you $5
to do that walk out of here?

13:19.336 --> 13:20.870
Prepare to have
your minds blown.

13:20.904 --> 13:23.740
Okay.

13:23.774 --> 13:25.008
All right.

13:34.551 --> 13:40.490
Uh...

13:40.524 --> 13:42.692
This is who Walt
expects me to train.

13:42.726 --> 13:45.695
A guy dressed
head to toe in silk.

13:45.729 --> 13:47.230
If you put a twist tie
on his head,

13:47.264 --> 13:48.331
He'd look like a loaf
of white bread.

13:48.349 --> 13:51.434
All soft and white and gross.

13:51.468 --> 13:52.702
But I'm up for the challenge.

13:52.736 --> 13:54.537
What are your qualifications?
Why are you training us?

13:54.571 --> 13:57.490
I have seen people
that are fit.

13:57.541 --> 13:59.108
I have talked to people
who are fit.

13:59.143 --> 14:02.078
- And he saw <i>Rocky III</i> twice.
- Exactly.

14:02.112 --> 14:07.050
That was more of a motivator
than a trainer.

14:07.084 --> 14:08.351
To just about anything
I threw their way.

14:08.385 --> 14:09.852
They would have to me
super receptive

14:09.886 --> 14:12.155
To be trained by someone
who's not running themselves,

14:12.189 --> 14:15.058
Or never gonna run, either.

14:19.262 --> 14:21.698
Gimme some jumping jacks!

14:21.732 --> 14:23.666
- Left, right.
- Left, right, left...

14:23.701 --> 14:25.435
- Come on. Come on!
- Okay.

14:27.638 --> 14:29.505
Yeah.

14:34.378 --> 14:35.411
Yeah!

14:51.161 --> 14:53.896
Run for your life.
Go!

15:04.688 --> 15:07.624
What do you think
is the best accessory

15:07.658 --> 15:09.459
That a superhero has?

15:09.493 --> 15:10.894
Or supervillain.

15:10.928 --> 15:12.896
- Captain America's shield.
- That's awesome.

15:12.930 --> 15:14.364
At about Green Lantern's ring?

15:14.398 --> 15:15.798
I was gonna say
the battery and the ring?

15:15.816 --> 15:18.001
- Web shooters.
- Oh, yeah.

15:18.035 --> 15:20.069
Batgirl's motorcycle.

15:20.104 --> 15:22.939
- The purple one?
- Yeah.

15:22.973 --> 15:26.709
I think I can ride that Batgirl's
motorcycle and still be badass.

15:26.727 --> 15:27.810
How you doing?

15:27.845 --> 15:29.045
Oh, I'm doing good.

15:29.063 --> 15:31.714
I have a comic
you might be interested in.

15:31.749 --> 15:33.983
I would be interested in this.
Look at this, Mike.

15:34.018 --> 15:35.051
That's the first
<i>Swamp Thing.</i>

15:41.926 --> 15:44.427
To me, my favorite run
of comic books of all time

15:44.461 --> 15:45.728
Is when Alan Moore
took over <i>Swamp Thing.</i>

15:45.763 --> 15:47.463
Yeah, that was
an unbelievable run.

15:47.498 --> 15:49.832
Len Wein, Bernie Wrightson,
with all due respect,

15:49.867 --> 15:51.935
They invent that character.

15:51.969 --> 15:55.238
But it's reinvented
brilliantly

15:55.272 --> 15:58.274
By alan moore, like,
a decade later.

15:58.309 --> 16:00.276
It is pure poetry.

16:00.311 --> 16:02.228
It's hands-down
some of the best writing

16:02.279 --> 16:04.948
I've ever read in my life,
and that includes the greats,

16:04.982 --> 16:08.868
Like Mark Twain,
Shakespeare.

16:08.919 --> 16:12.188
Top five characters of all time.

16:12.223 --> 16:14.757
Movies, comics, tv,
it doesn't matter.

16:14.792 --> 16:16.125
Swamp Thing is on that list.

16:16.160 --> 16:18.161
I could sit here all day

16:18.195 --> 16:19.879
And just slobber
over <i>Swamp Thing</i>

16:19.930 --> 16:22.398
And tell you
how awesome it is,

16:22.433 --> 16:25.468
But you already know that price.

16:25.502 --> 16:26.836
I was thinking maybe $400.

16:26.870 --> 16:28.972
$400, huh?
Glad I sat down.

16:29.006 --> 16:32.775
Any chance you could do
$200 for it?

16:32.810 --> 16:34.811
Oh, no, not $200.

16:34.845 --> 16:38.147
Sentimental value alone,
I just can't even--

16:38.182 --> 16:40.216
- Here we go again.
- Sentimental value.

16:40.251 --> 16:43.653
Unfortunately, we don't deal
with sentimental value.

16:43.687 --> 16:45.555
Come on, give me another number.
- All right.

16:45.589 --> 16:47.123
- $350?
- $300.

16:47.157 --> 16:52.161
That's really as high
as I can go.

16:52.196 --> 16:53.763
- I know it is.
- But on an auction site,

16:53.797 --> 16:54.831
- I'll probably get better.
- All right.

16:54.865 --> 16:56.799
- I'm sorry.
- I'm sorry, guys,

16:56.833 --> 16:58.334
- But thank you very much.
- All right, man.

16:58.369 --> 17:00.970
- All right, see you later.
- What are you gonna do?

17:01.005 --> 17:02.538
Couldn't pull the trigger.

17:08.345 --> 17:10.646
One, two, three, break.

17:10.681 --> 17:12.648
- All right, let's go.
- See you at the finish line.

17:12.683 --> 17:15.117
What is 5k in, like,
american mileage?

17:15.152 --> 17:16.336
3.1 miles.

17:16.369 --> 17:18.253
Do you feel ready
for three miles?

17:18.289 --> 17:20.189
No way.

17:20.223 --> 17:21.691
I tried to give him
a good attitude.

17:21.724 --> 17:23.526
You know, I imparted all the
knowledge that I've gained

17:23.560 --> 17:26.329
From, you know, the many years
of running that I've done.

17:26.363 --> 17:28.698
And them you put oil on him,
rubbed him down and stuff?

17:28.732 --> 17:32.402
You limber?

17:32.436 --> 17:34.070
You ready?

17:34.104 --> 17:35.872
- Okay. We should go.
- Yeah!

17:35.906 --> 17:38.941
At this time, any strategy
you have will not work.

17:38.976 --> 17:40.677
You want a piece of advice?

17:40.711 --> 17:43.479
Run for your life! Go!

17:43.514 --> 17:47.116
[all cheering]
- Off the right, off the right.

17:47.151 --> 17:49.569
- Oh, [bleep].
- Mike, we just started.

17:49.620 --> 17:51.888
Come on, man. Come on.

17:51.922 --> 17:55.191
Take a breath.
You're not gonna die, are you?

17:55.225 --> 17:56.959
[bleep].

17:56.994 --> 17:58.494
He hit the wall
ten seconds in.

17:58.529 --> 18:02.031
[laughter]

18:02.066 --> 18:04.267
But we were committed
to finishing.

18:04.301 --> 18:06.352
There was a lot on the line.
We had sponsors.

18:06.387 --> 18:08.971
We were running it
for the wayne foundation.

18:09.006 --> 18:10.340
We had to finish.
- At the end of the day, dude,

18:10.374 --> 18:18.114
Survival is what counts.

18:18.148 --> 18:19.382
- Come on.
- Oh, [bleep].

18:19.416 --> 18:21.617
Come on. We gotta
make it through this.

18:21.652 --> 18:24.520
[zombie growls]
- Aah!

18:24.555 --> 18:32.862
Aah! Aah!

18:32.896 --> 18:34.130
Aah!

18:37.651 --> 18:40.870
- Augh!
- Aah!

18:40.904 --> 18:44.040
It felt real. There were moments
it felt real.

18:44.074 --> 18:45.274
Why are you guys laughing?
It did!

18:45.309 --> 18:46.843
You guys weren't there.

18:46.877 --> 18:48.127
Oh, dude,
he's not even laughing.

18:48.162 --> 18:50.413
He's giving you
the pitiful this one, like...

18:50.447 --> 18:51.881
You guys weren't running
with us.

18:51.915 --> 18:54.434
I saw the zombies,
I saw the runners.

18:54.468 --> 18:56.185
There was nothing real
about it.

18:56.220 --> 18:57.887
[laughter]

18:57.921 --> 18:59.789
- Oh, man...
- You're doing great, man.

18:59.807 --> 19:01.090
There's too many zombies.
They're everywhere.

19:01.124 --> 19:02.291
Don't worry about it.

19:02.326 --> 19:03.726
I think we can walk
for a little while.

19:03.761 --> 19:04.911
- How you feeling?
- What the hell?

19:04.945 --> 19:07.080
It's a zombie run,
not a zombie walk!

19:07.114 --> 19:08.731
- Ow!
- Go on, now!

19:08.749 --> 19:12.001
You've been slacking.
I trained you better!

19:12.035 --> 19:13.970
You hit me in the head
with a severed hand.

19:14.004 --> 19:16.305
[laughter]
- Oh, no.

19:16.340 --> 19:18.741
You slow down, next thing
you know, you're stopped.

19:18.776 --> 19:20.209
Sometimes you gotta
think outside the box.

19:20.244 --> 19:21.411
My fear was that
I was gonna have to

19:21.445 --> 19:25.848
Carry this guy
off the course,

19:25.883 --> 19:29.452
[indistinct chatter]

19:29.486 --> 19:30.853
Oh, Christ!

19:36.527 --> 19:38.594
- Hoo-wah!
- Come on, Mike.

19:43.600 --> 19:47.303
[zombie growls]
Brains!

19:52.376 --> 19:54.744
All right.

19:57.548 --> 19:58.648
All right...

19:58.682 --> 19:59.916
This is electric, dude.

19:59.950 --> 20:01.217
All right.

20:01.251 --> 20:02.452
- Come on, boys.
- Come on.

20:02.486 --> 20:05.988
We're almost there.

20:09.726 --> 20:12.662
Come on, come on, come on!
Three more feet.

20:12.696 --> 20:14.497
Yeah.

20:14.531 --> 20:17.200
All right. We're alive.

20:17.234 --> 20:20.820
- Good job. Good job.
- Good job.

20:20.871 --> 20:23.573
- You were gonna make it.
- No, but I did finish,

20:23.607 --> 20:24.707
And it felt great.

20:24.741 --> 20:25.842
When it's all said and done,

20:25.876 --> 20:27.059
How much did you
come up with?

20:27.094 --> 20:28.077
We raised $1,100.

20:28.111 --> 20:30.412
And a fun time was had,
by all.

20:30.447 --> 20:34.450
I thank you for running on
behalf of the Wayne Foundation,

20:34.485 --> 20:36.652
I salute you guys.
That's a cool thing that you did.

20:36.687 --> 20:38.054
Would you do it again?

20:38.088 --> 20:40.790
Absolutely not.
[laughter]

20:40.824 --> 20:42.375
That's gonna wrap it up
for another episode

20:42.409 --> 20:44.026
Of <i>Comic Book Men</i>
for this week.

20:44.044 --> 20:48.748
But next week,

20:48.799 --> 20:50.900
Until then, I'm your host,
Kevin Smith.

20:52.870 --> 20:54.570
