00:02.500 --> 00:04.885
<i>Here's Kenneth Kreen's
review of Austin's concert.</i>

00:04.920 --> 00:08.471
"Austin Moon's performance
was tired and uninspired.

00:08.807 --> 00:11.926
It lacked the spectacle
of a superstar performer.

00:11.960 --> 00:15.630
Frankly, I've had more fun
plucking my nose hairs."

00:16.898 --> 00:20.494
If Austin sees this review,
it'll tear him apart.

00:20.652 --> 00:21.802
We better hide these magazines.

00:21.820 --> 00:22.853
He'll be here any minute.

00:22.904 --> 00:24.638
- Okay.
- How many did you buy?

00:24.656 --> 00:25.576
All of them.

00:25.657 --> 00:26.974
Let's go. Oh, wait! Oh!

00:26.992 --> 00:28.809
- That's no good.
- Sorry.

00:28.827 --> 00:30.644
- Pick them up!
- Hide, hide.

00:30.662 --> 00:33.622
We got this. Hide them
over in the piano.

00:33.698 --> 00:35.983
<i>Oh, uh... We got this.
We got this.</i>

00:36.001 --> 00:37.061
<i>He's gonna be here any minute!</i>

00:37.085 --> 00:38.085
Okay, um...

00:38.670 --> 00:40.087
Here he comes! Act natural.

00:45.877 --> 00:46.927
- Yo.
- 'Sup, buddy?

00:46.962 --> 00:48.242
Hey, good-looking.

00:49.798 --> 00:50.798
Hey, guys.

00:53.051 --> 00:54.051
Bam!

00:55.103 --> 00:57.663
Oh, the new issue
of "Miami Weekly."

00:58.690 --> 01:00.691
I have been looking
all over for one.

01:00.725 --> 01:01.725
No!

01:02.010 --> 01:04.920
No... one does the
word jumble before me.

01:08.867 --> 01:11.237
Hey, it's the review of my show.

01:13.655 --> 01:15.005
"Tired. Uninspired"?

01:16.041 --> 01:17.261
This is terrible.

01:17.859 --> 01:19.887
You guys could have at least
tried to hide it from me.

01:19.911 --> 01:20.911
We did.

01:21.663 --> 01:23.873
Dez has magazines in his pants.

01:23.915 --> 01:24.915
It's true.

01:25.750 --> 01:26.750

02:32.817 --> 02:34.327
This review is awful.

02:34.869 --> 02:39.790
Maybe I was a little tired, but I've
been performing almost every night.

02:39.824 --> 02:41.914
He's wrong. You were amazing.

02:42.077 --> 02:45.097
I've never had anyone
hate my show before.

02:45.830 --> 02:46.870
You know what?

02:46.998 --> 02:48.749
I'm gonna change his mind.

02:48.783 --> 02:49.883
What are you gonna do?

02:49.918 --> 02:52.636
He thinks I'm all
tired and uninspired.

02:52.670 --> 02:55.639
I'm gonna show him the
coolest performance ever.

02:55.673 --> 02:56.767
You want us to help you plan it?

02:56.791 --> 02:59.676
Thanks, but I think I got Austin
covered when it comes to cool.

02:59.728 --> 03:00.928
Check out my new exit.

03:00.962 --> 03:02.012

03:19.080 --> 03:20.981
Austin and I were up
all night last night

03:20.999 --> 03:22.916
thinking of awesome
performance ideas.

03:22.951 --> 03:26.703
Then it hit us. Nothing's more
awesome than our favorite comic book

03:26.755 --> 03:28.395
"the galactic adventures

03:28.656 --> 03:30.586
of the electric avengerrrr!"

03:33.878 --> 03:35.045
That's how you say it.

03:35.096 --> 03:37.066
Okay, well get to the point

03:37.766 --> 03:38.766
fasterrrr.

03:43.671 --> 03:46.640
We came up with an amazing
space themed performance.

03:46.674 --> 03:48.074
It's gonna blow
nneth keeen's mind.

03:49.010 --> 03:50.811
There's gonna be brain
matter everywhere.

03:50.845 --> 03:51.845
Literally.

03:52.113 --> 03:54.681
You don't know what
"literally" means, do you?

03:54.699 --> 03:55.699
Nope.

03:57.702 --> 03:59.562
Imagine this is the stage.

03:59.904 --> 04:02.114
And I'm the electric avengerrr!

04:03.958 --> 04:05.808
Yeah, that won't get old.

04:06.744 --> 04:10.717
Kenneth Kreen's gonna be sitting
here as represented by this egg.

04:12.700 --> 04:13.867
The music starts.

04:13.885 --> 04:15.919
Out of nowhere, cyborgs attack.

04:15.970 --> 04:17.053
I fight them off.

04:23.878 --> 04:25.798
Then, I'll dodge asteroids.

04:30.935 --> 04:31.935
And...

04:32.070 --> 04:35.859
After he defeats the
evil velotian queen...

04:39.077 --> 04:41.995
He'll fly through the air and
be the hero of planet zytrax.

04:42.030 --> 04:43.320
Electric avengerrr!

04:46.034 --> 04:48.952
How are you gonna sing
while battling cyborgs,

04:49.003 --> 04:50.921
dodging asteroids,
flying through the air,

04:50.955 --> 04:52.789
and fighting off
galactic queens?

04:52.841 --> 04:54.875
Whoo! I'm out of
breath just saying it.

04:54.909 --> 04:56.043
I already thought of that.

04:56.077 --> 04:59.096
I'll just prerecord the track
and pretend to sing along.

04:59.130 --> 05:00.130
Makes sense.

05:00.682 --> 05:01.765
It's not about the song.

05:01.799 --> 05:04.051
The point is to give Kenneth
Kreen an amazing show.

05:04.085 --> 05:07.587
Yeah, there's no way Kenneth Kreen's
gonna give Austin a bad review

05:07.605 --> 05:08.605
ter this,

05:08.773 --> 05:10.590
because he's gonna crush it.

05:12.777 --> 05:13.777
Huh.

05:13.945 --> 05:15.762
I thought Kenneth Kreen
was hard boiled.

05:24.873 --> 05:25.873
Mr. Kreen,

05:25.990 --> 05:27.941
you're gonna love
Austin's new show.

05:27.959 --> 05:29.776
Thank you so much for coming.

05:29.794 --> 05:32.629
Yes, well, it was either
watch this train wreck

05:32.664 --> 05:35.782
or hit myself over the
head with a frying pan.

05:35.800 --> 05:38.950
Unfortunately, I couldn't
find a frying pan.

05:38.970 --> 05:40.954
At least you're
keeping an open mind.

05:44.842 --> 05:45.882

05:46.928 --> 05:49.538
<i>in a universe kind

05:58.072 --> 06:00.282

06:58.085 --> 07:00.920
Kenneth Kreen just posted his
review of last night's performance.

07:00.971 --> 07:02.061
It's not good.

07:04.875 --> 07:05.875
Hey, Austin.

07:07.060 --> 07:09.011
Was that Kenneth Kreen's review?

07:09.045 --> 07:11.705
Yeah. It's not as
bad as we thought.

07:13.600 --> 07:14.901
You're kidding. Let me see.

07:14.935 --> 07:16.775
No, I'll read it to you.

07:16.854 --> 07:20.907
"Austin Moon is and always will be
the most awesome performer ever."

07:20.941 --> 07:21.991
That's it. You heard him.

07:26.947 --> 07:27.947
Oh.

07:30.784 --> 07:34.385
"Austin Moon lip-synched through
a catastrophic performance.

07:34.705 --> 07:37.673
He's just another pretty
boy fraud who can't sing"?

07:37.708 --> 07:39.858
At least he called you pretty.

07:40.043 --> 07:43.045
I only lip-synched 'cause I
was trying to impress him.

07:43.079 --> 07:44.079
This stinks.

07:44.965 --> 07:47.767
No one's ever questioned
my musical ability before.

07:47.801 --> 07:50.920
You know you're the real deal,
and that's all that matters.

07:50.938 --> 07:53.558
Maybe I am freaking
out over nothing.

07:53.640 --> 07:55.024
So I got two bad reviews.

07:55.058 --> 07:56.609
It's not gonna change my life.

08:01.765 --> 08:03.805
That's never happened before.

08:03.934 --> 08:06.024
Maybe it is changing my life.

08:06.737 --> 08:07.987
I think I'm losing my swag.

08:08.038 --> 08:09.188
No, you're not.

08:10.941 --> 08:12.575
And I'll prove it to you.

08:13.777 --> 08:16.157
Here. Sing a song
to those girls.

08:16.613 --> 08:17.833
Great idea. Yeah.

08:19.666 --> 08:20.666
Hey, girls.

08:20.801 --> 08:23.753
♪ Been counting every
second of the day... ♪

08:27.624 --> 08:29.809

playing music anymore.

08:31.895 --> 08:32.895
Yeah.

08:34.731 --> 08:37.581
I've never seen Austin
like this before.

08:37.768 --> 08:40.937
A couple bad reviews, and it's like
he's completely falling apart.

08:40.971 --> 08:42.989
It's a textbook case, actually.

08:43.023 --> 08:45.658
When one loses confidence
in the thing he's best at,

08:45.692 --> 08:47.994
he gets washed away in a
tidal wave of self doubt,

08:48.028 --> 08:50.746
causing him to question
everything else in his life.

08:50.781 --> 08:53.616
So you're saying because
he's doubting his music,

08:53.650 --> 08:55.701
he's losing his confidence
with everything?

08:55.752 --> 08:58.740
No, Ally. I said...
"It's a textbook case.

08:59.790 --> 09:00.990
When one loses confidence
in the thing he's..."

09:01.008 --> 09:02.008
we get it.

09:02.676 --> 09:05.678
We have to help Austin
get his confidence back.

09:07.764 --> 09:09.784
And we'd better do it fast.

09:12.769 --> 09:13.919
I think I lost.

09:23.680 --> 09:25.014
Yeah, tech support?

09:26.900 --> 09:28.640
I went swimming with it.

09:28.952 --> 09:30.112
Not supposed to?

09:30.737 --> 09:33.573
Well, what if I'm drowning
and need to call for help?

09:33.624 --> 09:35.184
I demand a new phone!

09:35.792 --> 09:37.002
Yeah, I'll hold,

09:37.694 --> 09:38.794
but I am not happy!

09:39.963 --> 09:41.303
Hello, dear friend.

09:43.634 --> 09:44.634
Uh... hello?

09:44.868 --> 09:47.368
I know you've lost
your confidence,

09:47.671 --> 09:48.671
your swagger,

09:48.889 --> 09:50.569
your swag, if you will.

09:50.841 --> 09:53.271
So please, join
me as I guide you

09:53.710 --> 09:56.678
on a relaxing journey to
find your inner peace.

09:56.813 --> 10:00.933
I just came to get an inner piece
of cheese for my salami sandwich.

10:00.984 --> 10:03.819
Eating's the only thing
that brings me joy.

10:05.822 --> 10:06.889
Forget the sandwich.

10:06.907 --> 10:08.937
Sit down and calm your mind.

10:13.664 --> 10:16.916
Now let's start with some
positive affirmations.

10:16.950 --> 10:19.510
Close your eyes and
repeat after me.

10:22.005 --> 10:24.395
You are strong. You
are confident.

10:24.925 --> 10:26.955
I am strong. I am confident.

10:27.794 --> 10:30.524
You are talented. You
are not a fraud.

10:30.747 --> 10:33.049
I am talented. I'm not a fraud.

10:33.083 --> 10:34.173
Hold on a sec.

10:34.918 --> 10:36.008
Hold on a sec.

10:37.754 --> 10:38.964
Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

10:40.090 --> 10:41.090
Uh-huh.

10:41.892 --> 10:43.682
Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh.

10:45.095 --> 10:46.775
You can't do anything?!

10:47.097 --> 10:48.597
I can't do anything?

10:48.899 --> 10:52.068
You are useless, worthless,
and horrible at what you do.

10:52.102 --> 10:54.987
I'm useless, worthless, and
horrible at what I do.

10:55.038 --> 10:58.910
Now get me a new phone right now
or you'll see what happens.

10:59.793 --> 11:01.944
- Where are you going?
- To get you a new phone.

11:01.962 --> 11:03.713
I don't want to
see what happens.

11:12.973 --> 11:13.973
Hey, Tiffany.

11:14.057 --> 11:16.537
I need you to do
me a huge favor.

11:16.677 --> 11:18.297
Oh, sure. Who are you?

11:18.845 --> 11:21.897
I've sat next to you in home
room for the last three years.

11:21.932 --> 11:23.032
Oh, right. Zed.

11:24.651 --> 11:25.651
Close enough.

11:26.970 --> 11:31.379
Listen, my friend, Austin Moon, is
having some trouble with girls.

11:31.658 --> 11:34.076
So no matter what he says,
just tell him how great he is.

11:34.111 --> 11:36.746
Austin Moon's having
trouble with girls?

11:36.780 --> 11:37.747
But he's so cool.

11:37.781 --> 11:38.871
He used to be.

11:39.116 --> 11:40.726
Now I'm the cool one.

11:40.917 --> 11:42.307
Can you believe it?

11:42.753 --> 11:43.753
No.

11:44.705 --> 11:46.035
Oh, here he comes.

11:46.673 --> 11:47.673
Hey, Austin.

11:48.041 --> 11:49.925
See that cheerleader over there?

11:49.960 --> 11:52.110
She's eyeballing you big time.

11:52.963 --> 11:54.873
You should go talk to her.

11:56.016 --> 11:57.717
Nah. I'm not really feeling it.

11:57.768 --> 11:59.018
Great! Go get 'em, tiger.

12:03.807 --> 12:04.807
'Sup?

12:04.975 --> 12:06.185
Ow! Ow, my hair!

12:06.810 --> 12:07.860
Sorry sorry sorry.

12:07.894 --> 12:10.696
Zed was right. You are
so not cool anymore.

12:10.731 --> 12:11.841
I...

12:14.851 --> 12:15.851
'Sup.

12:17.070 --> 12:18.510
Get me out of here.

12:18.905 --> 12:19.905
I'm on it.

12:20.073 --> 12:21.073
Wait, wait.

12:23.994 --> 12:26.912
I could have just given you
my locker combination.

12:26.963 --> 12:28.798
Uh, have you seen your hair?

12:28.832 --> 12:30.833
Trust me. I'm doing you a favor.

12:41.895 --> 12:45.815
Austin, are you really reading
Kenneth Kreen's review again?

12:45.849 --> 12:46.849
Yeah.

12:47.050 --> 12:49.101
The only good word in
here is "incredible."

12:49.152 --> 12:53.402
He said it's "incredible" people
pay money to see my shows.

12:54.107 --> 12:57.993
I never thought I'd say this, but
Austin, you're reading too much.

12:59.696 --> 13:02.581
Look, Trish booked you
a do-over concert.

13:02.616 --> 13:05.835
Once you get up there and rock,
you'll get your confidence back.

13:05.869 --> 13:08.239
I don't think that's gonna work.

13:08.622 --> 13:09.872
I've lost my swag, Ally.

13:09.906 --> 13:12.591
You just need somebody
to help you get it back.

13:12.626 --> 13:13.926
And I have just the person.

13:18.765 --> 13:20.215
Pack your swag bags,

13:20.801 --> 13:25.457
'cause swag master Ally's taking you
to swag town in her station swagon.

13:25.639 --> 13:27.259
Honk honk! Mm, mm, mm.

13:29.059 --> 13:30.059
Thanks, Ally.

13:30.777 --> 13:33.062
You just ruined the
word "swag" forever.

13:33.096 --> 13:35.886
Look, I know what
you're going through.

13:36.766 --> 13:40.936
I used to be a scared little girl
who couldn't perform just like you.

13:40.954 --> 13:43.504
Did you just call
me a little girl?

13:43.773 --> 13:46.143
I mean, I've been where you are.

13:46.776 --> 13:49.912
I know what it's like to go on stage
and feel an overwhelming fear

13:49.946 --> 13:51.856
that you're going to fail.

13:52.716 --> 13:54.800
It's like the whole
world is judging you.

13:54.835 --> 13:57.196
Students, teachers,
doctors, judges.

13:59.890 --> 14:01.924
Your hand and feet
start to tingle.

14:01.958 --> 14:03.638
You break into a sweat.

14:03.844 --> 14:05.794
You start to have
a panic attack.

14:05.812 --> 14:07.930
It's like the walls
are closing in on me.

14:07.964 --> 14:09.932
The walls are closing in on me!

14:09.966 --> 14:12.396
I can't breathe.
I can't breathe.

14:15.805 --> 14:17.185
But I got over it.

14:17.640 --> 14:18.741
And you will too.

14:18.775 --> 14:20.002
You are gonna be great tonight.

14:20.026 --> 14:21.246
Gotta go.

14:33.039 --> 14:34.429
I'm really nervous.

14:34.708 --> 14:36.903
When you had stage fright,
how'd you calm yourself down?

14:36.927 --> 14:37.993
I chewed my hair.

14:39.930 --> 14:41.797
Don't even think about it.

14:44.684 --> 14:46.424
You can do this, Austin.

14:46.803 --> 14:47.803
You're right.

14:48.838 --> 14:49.928
I can do this.

14:56.062 --> 14:57.846
In, auststin, Austin!

15:00.850 --> 15:01.850
Whoo!

15:01.985 --> 15:03.135
You're a fraud.

15:03.954 --> 15:05.454
You are so not cool.

15:06.623 --> 15:08.741
You are horrible at what you do.

15:08.792 --> 15:10.372
The electric avengerrr!

15:11.962 --> 15:13.592
Everyone's judging you.

15:14.631 --> 15:17.076
Students, teachers,
doctors, judges.

15:27.877 --> 15:28.877
Poor Austin.

15:29.813 --> 15:30.846
It's gotten worse.

15:30.880 --> 15:32.765
Now he has full-blown
stage fright.

15:32.816 --> 15:33.816
I hope not.

15:34.067 --> 15:37.019
That would mean the end
of his singing career.

15:37.053 --> 15:40.773
But it could be the beginning
of his track and field career.

15:40.824 --> 15:42.444
Man, that boy can run.

15:55.102 --> 15:56.102
Hey.

15:58.072 --> 16:00.672
I don't know what's
happened to me.

16:00.942 --> 16:04.002
I got on stage and I
just couldn't do it.

16:04.195 --> 16:06.885
I started seeing
faces, hearing voices.

16:07.915 --> 16:10.951
There was even an old-timey
English judge in the audience.

16:11.002 --> 16:13.792
I used to see the
entire supreme court.

16:14.255 --> 16:18.073
I'll never forget the disappointment
on Ruth Bader Ginsburg's face.

16:19.343 --> 16:21.953
I don't think I can
perform anymore.

16:22.096 --> 16:26.498
I mean, I flew off that stage
faster than the electric avengerrr.

16:28.135 --> 16:30.405
Austin, it's gonna get betterrr.

16:33.274 --> 16:35.764
I know you're gonna
get over this.

16:35.943 --> 16:36.943
I did.

16:37.195 --> 16:38.311
And you know how?

16:38.362 --> 16:40.442
'Cause I had you by my side.

16:42.950 --> 16:43.950
I know.

16:44.202 --> 16:46.869
I used to feel like I could do
anything with you by my side.

16:46.954 --> 16:48.284
And you still can.

16:48.956 --> 16:52.582
Listen, this all started with that
bad review from Kenneth Kreen.

16:52.994 --> 16:56.296
If you win him over, I'm sure
you'll get your confidence back.

16:56.330 --> 17:00.050
Even if I wanted to perform for him
again, he's not gonna want to see me.

17:00.084 --> 17:01.814
He won't have a choice.

17:01.919 --> 17:04.287
Trish just texted me that he's having
dinner at the beach club right now.

17:04.305 --> 17:06.138
Wow. That's a coincidence.

17:06.173 --> 17:07.173
Not really.

17:07.925 --> 17:11.060
Trish gave him a free meal
coupon to get him there.

17:11.095 --> 17:13.930
It's fake... And his
meal will not be free.

17:22.138 --> 17:23.282
Dez, stall him while
I get more food.

17:23.307 --> 17:24.307
Way ahead of you.

17:32.033 --> 17:34.034
- Any requests, sir?
- Oh, yes.

17:34.085 --> 17:36.336
Something from Vivaldi's "four
seasons" would be nice.

17:36.370 --> 17:37.530
Oh, my pleasure.

17:45.263 --> 17:47.063
Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa.
You can't leave yet.

17:47.098 --> 17:48.214
You still have food coming.

17:48.266 --> 17:50.350
Oh no. I've had enough
of this so-called food,

17:50.384 --> 17:53.303
starting with that pathetic
excuse for a salad.

17:53.337 --> 17:56.306
I'm sure there's more flavor
in a handful of sand.

17:58.142 --> 18:00.277
No, I'm gonna have to
go with the salad.

18:02.146 --> 18:06.032
As if the food wasn't bad enough,
the service, it was appalling.

18:06.067 --> 18:09.119
I've had wild monkeys spill
less soup in my lap.

18:09.153 --> 18:10.153
Seriously.

18:10.237 --> 18:13.990
I dined at a restaurant in Brazil where
the waiters were howling monkeys.

18:15.960 --> 18:17.193
Wait wait wait. Don't go.

18:17.211 --> 18:19.129
Tell me another monkey story.

18:19.163 --> 18:20.163
Well...

18:20.381 --> 18:21.781
okay, Kenneth Kreen.

18:22.216 --> 18:25.051
I'm gonna show you that I
don't need to lip-synch.

18:25.086 --> 18:27.053
I'm not just a pretty
boy who can't sing.

18:27.088 --> 18:28.371
I'm a pretty boy who can sing.

18:29.390 --> 18:30.390
Bravo.

18:31.092 --> 18:33.719
Your arrogance is matched
only by your incompetence.

18:36.213 --> 18:38.264
It's not an insult if I
don't know what it means.

18:40.401 --> 18:42.352
Go show him what you
can do, Austin.

18:42.386 --> 18:43.596

18:44.271 --> 18:45.271

20:17.981 --> 20:18.981
Bravo.

20:20.984 --> 20:22.024
A speccular. Ta

20:22.420 --> 20:23.690
waste of my time.

20:24.288 --> 20:26.208
Just like these crab cakes.

20:26.424 --> 20:28.341
Underwhelming and predictable.

20:29.993 --> 20:31.327
How could you not like that?

20:31.345 --> 20:33.975
Yeah. These crab cakes
are incredible.

20:36.166 --> 20:37.383
Don't worry about it, Austin.

20:37.435 --> 20:38.384
It's not you.

20:38.436 --> 20:40.646
This guy doesn't like anything.

20:41.004 --> 20:43.743
The food, the music,
my impeccable service.

20:45.309 --> 20:46.342
Okay, forget that last part.

20:46.360 --> 20:47.400
You know what?

20:49.012 --> 20:51.314
This whole time I've been
trying to please you.

20:51.348 --> 20:54.018
But why should I
care what you think?

20:55.286 --> 20:57.906
Why should I care
what anyone thinks?

20:58.021 --> 20:59.111
I know I rock.

20:59.373 --> 21:00.883
- Yeah.
- He's back.

21:00.991 --> 21:02.571
The electric avengerrr!

21:04.161 --> 21:06.731
This evening was a
complete travesty.

21:07.164 --> 21:09.198
But at least my meal was free.

21:09.216 --> 21:11.167
Actually, your coupon was fake.

21:11.201 --> 21:12.401
You have to pay for your meal.

21:15.139 --> 21:16.339
You call this a bill?

21:16.373 --> 21:18.933
I've seen better
paper in outhouses.

21:22.625 --> 21:23.726
Thanks, guys.

21:23.760 --> 21:25.761
I'll never be nervous
to perform again.

21:27.597 --> 21:29.598
Uh-oh.

21:29.632 --> 21:30.766
Maybe I'm not better.

21:30.800 --> 21:31.800
I see an old-timey judge.

21:31.835 --> 21:35.437
Relax, Austin. We see him too.

21:35.472 --> 21:36.772
Sir?

21:36.806 --> 21:38.874
The costume party's
in the back room.

21:51.821 --> 21:54.656
Huh. Now that I have
my confidence back,

21:54.691 --> 21:57.459
I guess I won't be
seeing you guys anymore.

21:57.494 --> 21:58.660
Adios.

21:58.695 --> 21:59.795
Whoo!

21:59.829 --> 22:01.630
Good for you, Austin.

22:03.767 --> 22:08.570
So what are we
supposed to do now?

22:08.605 --> 22:10.405
I don't know.
