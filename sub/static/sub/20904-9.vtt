30:18.271 --> 30:20.440

30:20.507 --> 30:22.876
<b>This tattoo is strong.</b>

30:25.045 --> 30:26.446

30:30.283 --> 30:31.818
<b>At first glance,</b>
<b>it's interesting,</b>

30:31.885 --> 30:33.053
<b>and it's dynamic.</b>

30:33.053 --> 30:34.888
<b>I also like</b>
<b>the spots on this thing.</b>

30:34.955 --> 30:38.225
<b>Just adds a nice detail</b>
<b>and nice otherworldliness,</b>

30:38.291 --> 30:41.061
<b>and it also helps guide</b>
<b>the sinew of the body</b>

30:41.127 --> 30:43.129

30:46.132 --> 30:48.668

<b>this tattoo.</b>

30:50.437 --> 30:51.838
<b>- Old Town Ink.</b>

30:53.540 --> 30:55.742
<b>The elements within the tattoo</b>

30:55.809 --> 30:57.577
<b>I just don't know if it nails</b>

30:57.644 --> 30:59.946
<b>the proportion aspect</b>
<b>of this challenge.</b>

31:00.080 --> 31:02.782

<b>is just entirely too small.</b>

31:02.849 --> 31:04.251
<b>Your anatomy is totally off.</b>

31:04.317 --> 31:06.086
<b>Her chest line's to the right,</b>

31:06.152 --> 31:08.588
<b>and then her stomach's</b>
<b>all the way to the left.</b>

31:08.655 --> 31:10.924
<b>That turn is an impossibility.</b>

31:10.991 --> 31:12.826
<b>It's just a huge miss</b>

31:15.495 --> 31:16.730
<b>- Unkindness Art.</b>

31:18.732 --> 31:21.601
<b>- The action of her sitting</b>
<b>in the ring looks really great,</b>

31:21.668 --> 31:23.470
<b>and I really, really like</b>
<b>these legs--</b>

31:23.537 --> 31:25.772

<b>the position--</b>

31:25.839 --> 31:27.073
<b>I think they're beautiful,</b>

31:27.140 --> 31:31.444
<b>but she has</b>
<b>a pretty manly upper body.</b>

31:31.511 --> 31:33.780
<b>Also, it looks</b>
<b>like she's missing a breast</b>

31:33.847 --> 31:35.348
<b>and she just has a bustier.</b>

31:35.415 --> 31:37.751
<b>- It takes this character</b>
<b>from being in the main tent</b>

31:37.817 --> 31:39.553
<b>and puts her in the sideshow.</b>

31:42.189 --> 31:43.557
<b>Black Cobra Tattoo.</b>

31:45.926 --> 31:47.460

32:09.516 --> 32:10.817
<b>It's not</b>

32:10.884 --> 32:13.486

<b>which one's the back leg?</b>

32:25.031 --> 32:26.500

32:39.880 --> 32:42.082

32:42.148 --> 32:46.052
<b>- I've got to be honest,</b>
<b>if Basilica punched in the color</b>

32:46.086 --> 32:48.722
<b>the way Black Cobra did,</b>
<b>that's bulletproof tattooing.</b>

32:48.788 --> 32:52.192
<b>- But I would argue</b>
<b>that the proportions in Basilica</b>

32:52.259 --> 32:53.360
<b>are more spot-on.</b>

32:53.426 --> 32:56.062
<b>- Yes.</b>
<b>- My vote is for Basilica.</b>

32:58.098 --> 32:59.099
