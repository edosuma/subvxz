00:31.499 --> 00:34.602
It's story time!

00:34.635 --> 00:37.438
Story time! I love stories.

00:37.471 --> 00:39.573
Yo, tell that ones
about the three billy goats.

00:39.607 --> 00:42.410
I loves that part
where they wreck that troll.

00:42.443 --> 00:45.546
I wish to hear the tale
of the tiny fairy princess

00:45.579 --> 00:48.482
who rides a cat
as though it were a horse.

00:48.516 --> 00:51.152
Meow! Meow!

00:51.185 --> 00:53.287
I have
an even better story to tell.

00:53.321 --> 00:55.823
It's an origin story.

00:55.856 --> 00:58.226
Oh, snap, I love orangins.

00:58.259 --> 01:01.295
So juicy and filled
with that vitamin C's.

01:01.329 --> 01:05.333
Not exactly, but this is
indeed a juicy, pulpy tale.

01:06.400 --> 01:08.702
It begins many years ago,

01:08.736 --> 01:11.139
on a night like any other.

01:11.172 --> 01:13.841
At that time I was
a young circus acrobat,

01:13.874 --> 01:16.344
- part of the famous...
- Hold up!

01:16.377 --> 01:17.845
Did you say "circus?"

01:17.878 --> 01:22.216
Ah, he is again telling the
depressing tale of his childhood.

01:22.250 --> 01:25.586
It's not a depressing tale,
it's my origin story!

01:25.619 --> 01:27.721
Nah, we want to hear
about fruit, bro.

01:27.755 --> 01:30.324
Come on, I didn't even get
to the good part yet.

01:30.358 --> 01:31.725
There are no good parts.

01:31.759 --> 01:33.594
All of the parts are the sad.

01:33.627 --> 01:36.830
That's what makes origin story
so great.

01:36.864 --> 01:38.599
The heart-wrenching tragedy.

01:38.632 --> 01:42.270
If you want a tragic origin
story, you should hear mine.

01:42.303 --> 01:45.506
Oh, yeah, tells it, mama.
I loves this one.

01:45.539 --> 01:47.208
No! I'm in the middle
of telling

01:47.241 --> 01:49.610
my poignant origin story.

01:50.944 --> 01:54.348
All right, it starts way back
when I just a normal kid

01:54.382 --> 01:56.217
living with some old people.

01:59.220 --> 02:01.289
Oh, no, I need to get
to the science lab.

02:01.322 --> 02:03.191
I got to go,
old people raising me.

02:03.224 --> 02:04.892
Before you go, remember,

02:04.925 --> 02:06.494
if you ever get superpowers

02:06.527 --> 02:08.896
you should probably use it
to do some good

02:08.929 --> 02:11.465
instead of not doing some good.

02:11.499 --> 02:12.566
Quiet, old man,

02:12.600 --> 02:16.237
you don't know anything about my life.

02:19.873 --> 02:21.775
I don't know why they hired
a teenage photographer

02:21.809 --> 02:24.512
to take pictures of all
these secret lab experiments,

02:24.545 --> 02:27.915
but I sure am grateful for the work.

02:27.948 --> 02:30.384
Oh, man,

02:30.418 --> 02:31.852
that dang raven just bit me!

02:31.885 --> 02:34.588
I hope it wasn't
one of those radioactive ones.

02:35.789 --> 02:39.227
Oh, great, now I'm gonna
get radiation poisoning and...

02:39.260 --> 02:40.728
Oh, wait...

02:40.761 --> 02:43.163
I'm feeling stronger.

02:44.832 --> 02:46.534
What? Awesome!

02:46.567 --> 02:49.437
I got superpowers from
that radioactive bird bite.

02:52.906 --> 02:56.176
Ah!

03:00.448 --> 03:03.351
It's pretty funny.

03:17.265 --> 03:19.567
- Let us out.
- Oh, my goodness, help!

03:19.600 --> 03:21.302
Those people look like
they could use my help.

03:21.335 --> 03:24.238
But I'm too busy having fun
with my superpowers.

03:24.272 --> 03:25.739
Before you go, remember,

03:25.773 --> 03:28.609
if you ever get superpowers,
you should probably use it

03:28.642 --> 03:31.845
to do some good instead of
not doing some good.

03:31.879 --> 03:35.749
Mmm, maybe the old man raising
me with his old wife was right.

03:49.029 --> 03:50.698
Help me!

03:50.731 --> 03:53.501
Help.
Can't breathe. Ahhh!

03:55.869 --> 03:57.671
So I saved a bunch of people

03:57.705 --> 04:00.308
with my sweet new superpowers
and thought to myself,

04:00.341 --> 04:02.410
"Hey, I should
do this more often."

04:02.443 --> 04:04.445
Radioactive bird bite!

04:04.478 --> 04:06.514
- Classic.
- Yeah, it was pretty cool.

04:06.547 --> 04:07.748
Oh, an old man passed away

04:07.781 --> 04:10.017
at the age of 95
from natural causes.

04:13.053 --> 04:15.823
He died too young.

04:15.856 --> 04:17.658
Wow!

04:17.691 --> 04:21.295
That story is not true
and it is not tragic!

04:21.329 --> 04:23.331
You want some real tragedy, bro?

04:23.364 --> 04:25.599
Cyborg, tell this fool
your origin story

04:25.633 --> 04:28.436
- and don't leave nothing out.
- You got it, bro.

04:28.469 --> 04:30.371
It all started back in the day.

04:30.404 --> 04:31.872
I was born
on this doomed alien planet

04:31.905 --> 04:34.007
that was about to blow up
at any minute.

04:34.041 --> 04:36.410
To save me, my loving but questionable alien parents...

04:36.444 --> 04:37.911
...placed me in
some old raggedy capsule

04:37.945 --> 04:40.514
and shot me into outer space like some sha-wow!

04:40.548 --> 04:43.851
I was just a helpless baby boy slipping
through space all by my lonesome.

04:43.884 --> 04:46.420
It was crazy. I don't know
what they were thinking.

04:46.454 --> 04:49.857
Then boom, I crash landed on
some random farm here on Earth.

04:49.890 --> 04:52.660
This nice old farm couple
found me all naked and crying,

04:52.693 --> 04:54.928
so they decided to take me in
and raise me as their own.

04:54.962 --> 04:57.798
Later I discovered I had all types of cool powers.

04:57.831 --> 04:58.766
So I left that farm life

04:58.799 --> 05:00.701
and became a superhero instead.

05:00.734 --> 05:02.903
Saving people falling off things...

05:02.936 --> 05:05.906
...like tall buildings, waterfalls,
ladders, horses and chairs.

05:05.939 --> 05:08.108
And that's how I ended up
here on Earth all super like.

05:08.141 --> 05:09.677
- Ooh!
- Wow!

05:09.710 --> 05:11.845
Oh, and that nice old
farm couple that raised me

05:11.879 --> 05:14.815
later fell on hard times with the
climate change, agricultural subsidies

05:14.848 --> 05:16.684
and the advent
of industrial farming.

05:16.717 --> 05:18.786
They lost their farm
and are now homeless.

05:19.853 --> 05:23.491
That is really tragic.

05:24.925 --> 05:27.495
That was even more ridiculous
than the last one.

05:27.528 --> 05:28.696
You guys are making a mockery

05:28.729 --> 05:31.098
of these sacred
and tragic tales.

05:31.131 --> 05:33.867
- We would never.
- Yes, you would.

05:33.901 --> 05:37.104
This is serious stuff and you
should take it seriously.

05:37.137 --> 05:38.706
Robin, is correct.

05:38.739 --> 05:40.908
There and a for I shall recount

05:40.941 --> 05:43.110
the true tale of my origin.

05:43.143 --> 05:45.579
Dark and tragic though it is.

05:45.613 --> 05:49.583
My kitties and I had just seen
the wondrous moving picture.

05:49.617 --> 05:51.919
Oh, what
a wondrous moving picture!

05:51.952 --> 05:55.856
I did not think the hot shot fighter
pilots would ever be the friends,

05:55.889 --> 05:58.859
but I was the incorrect.

05:58.892 --> 06:01.462
Oh, you wish to take
the shortcut home?

06:03.163 --> 06:05.132
Through the dark
and the grimy ally?

06:05.165 --> 06:07.134
Very well!

06:07.167 --> 06:08.602
♪ Ha, la, la, la ♪

06:08.636 --> 06:10.704
♪ La, la, la, la, la, la ♪

06:19.112 --> 06:20.481
Kitties?

06:22.583 --> 06:24.885
Kitties!

06:27.621 --> 06:30.157
I vowed to bring
the mean puppies of the city

06:30.190 --> 06:31.391
to justice.

06:31.425 --> 06:34.962
Using my departed kitties'
vast fortune I built

06:34.995 --> 06:40.000
the Crime Fighting Cave
and The Very Nice Computer.

06:40.033 --> 06:42.770
Thank you, Kitty Alfred.

06:45.939 --> 06:47.508
The kitty alarm!

06:49.176 --> 06:51.912
The Joking Dog...
Leave it to me.

07:01.622 --> 07:05.559
This city belongs to me,
Joking Dog.

07:05.593 --> 07:08.529
Down, down, down.

07:08.562 --> 07:11.832
No. No, boy, no. Stay.

07:11.865 --> 07:13.801
And so I became

07:13.834 --> 07:16.604
the protector of
the good kitties of the city.

07:16.637 --> 07:18.539
A guardian that is quiet.

07:18.572 --> 07:20.708
A knight with the lights off.

07:21.709 --> 07:23.010
And that is the end.

07:23.043 --> 07:25.513
Oh, except Doggy Bane
once cracked my spine

07:25.546 --> 07:27.881
and I was unable to walk
for some time.

07:32.553 --> 07:34.655
It's all so plausibly tragic.

07:36.690 --> 07:38.559
That is Batman's origin story

07:38.592 --> 07:41.962
with you as Batman and everyone
else as cats and dogs.

07:41.995 --> 07:43.964
I thought Batman was bitten
by a radioactive bat

07:43.997 --> 07:45.899
- or something.
- Oh, no, no, no, that was me.

07:45.933 --> 07:47.535
Remember, with the bird?

07:47.568 --> 07:49.202
Batman came from
a planet of bats,

07:49.236 --> 07:52.172
but the Earth's yellow sun
gives him extra man powers.

07:52.205 --> 07:53.874
Huh, I thought's my dude got hit

07:53.907 --> 07:57.177
with that bat gamma radiation
so he gets all them muskels.

07:57.210 --> 08:00.247
He wasn't... You can't...
You can't just make up...

08:00.280 --> 08:02.215
Forget it.

08:02.249 --> 08:05.586
You know, I thought sharing our origin
stories would help us reflect on

08:05.619 --> 08:07.921
the awesome responsibility
we have as heroes,

08:07.955 --> 08:09.122
but I guess not.

08:09.156 --> 08:11.825
All right, dude,
you wants the real story?

08:11.859 --> 08:14.628
I'm gonna tell you
the real story, for real.

08:14.662 --> 08:16.129
Thank you, Beast Boy.

08:16.163 --> 08:18.932
Buckles up your butts, y'all,
'cause this is my origins.

08:20.768 --> 08:23.136
Back in the day
I was a test pilot,

08:23.170 --> 08:26.907
flying all kinds of crazy
experimental fighter jets.

08:28.408 --> 08:31.011
They call me
The Man Without Fear, yo.

08:31.044 --> 08:33.714
'Cause I wasn't afraid of nothing!

08:35.849 --> 08:38.686
I ain't afraid of nothing!

08:38.719 --> 08:40.688
One night I was on the beach
just chillin',

08:40.721 --> 08:44.224
thinking about how rad and
fearless I is and such things,

08:44.257 --> 08:48.161
when I saw something in the sky.

08:48.195 --> 08:50.130
Whoa, gnarly!

08:51.932 --> 08:56.970
I have searched the galaxy
for you, Man Without Fear.

08:57.004 --> 08:58.672
Take this ring.

08:59.106 --> 09:02.009
Use it for good!

09:12.686 --> 09:14.822
That's what's up... Fresh.

09:14.855 --> 09:17.290
So basically I gots
this sick ring from an alien

09:17.324 --> 09:19.326
and then I did things
like protect the universe

09:19.359 --> 09:21.729
from red dudes and other guys.

09:21.762 --> 09:25.032
And that is the tale
of how I became the superhero.

09:25.065 --> 09:27.935
- Oh! Are you kidding me?
- Wow! Great story, really.

09:27.968 --> 09:29.336
I never knew you were a pilot.

09:29.369 --> 09:30.904
That's because he wasn't.

09:30.938 --> 09:33.941
He just told you
Green Lantern's origin story.

09:33.974 --> 09:35.643
Oh, yeah, duh!

09:35.676 --> 09:37.077
Why do you think
I'm green, fool?

09:37.110 --> 09:38.846
I don't know, something to do
with a rare monkey

09:38.879 --> 09:41.782
carrying an incurable disease,
an experimental serum.

09:41.815 --> 09:44.752
Oh, bro!

09:44.785 --> 09:46.820
Now yous the one
being ridiculous.

09:46.854 --> 09:48.355
Serums in monkeys.

09:48.388 --> 09:50.357
Get out of here.

09:50.390 --> 09:51.959
Wow! So you're green

09:51.992 --> 09:54.227
'cause you've been
a Green Lantern all this time.

09:54.261 --> 09:56.296
Nah, bro, nah.

09:56.329 --> 10:00.233
I'm just a fake green dude coming out
of Green Lantern's Green Lantern ring.

10:00.267 --> 10:03.236
Check it. Oh, what,

10:03.270 --> 10:06.373
I'm not even real!

10:06.406 --> 10:11.278
Oh, what a tragedy.

10:11.311 --> 10:15.683
My best friend's a hologram.
My best friend's a hologram.
