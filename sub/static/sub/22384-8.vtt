- What?

01:20.872 --> 01:22.040
We're too late!

01:23.249 --> 01:24.542
What's going on?

01:24.626 --> 01:25.877
We're under attack.

01:25.960 --> 01:28.379
What's going on down there?
Does anybody copy?

01:57.492 --> 01:59.828
- What?
- He's a spy. If he knows where we are,

01:59.911 --> 02:01.579
- so does the shadow monster.
- He's lying!

02:01.663 --> 02:03.456
He killed those soldiers.
He'll kill us, too!

02:03.540 --> 02:07.836

Okay, Will, Will, listen, listen.
Do you know who I am?

Do you know who I am?

Hold him down.

No! No! Let go! No! No! Let me go! Let go!

02:41.828 --> 02:43.454

- [Joyce] I'm sorry.

02:43.538 --> 02:46.791

Guys?

Hello?

06:11.412 --> 06:13.748
Yeah, I'm a little bit busy in here,
Susan.

06:13.831 --> 06:16.375
[Neil] Open the door. Right now.

06:25.468 --> 06:26.511
What's wrong?

06:26.594 --> 06:27.595
Why don't you tell us?

06:27.678 --> 06:29.305
Because I don't know.

06:29.388 --> 06:31.432
- We can't find Maxine.
- And her window's open.

06:33.684 --> 06:35.436
- Where is she?
- I don't know.

06:35.895 --> 06:37.188
You don't know? [scoffs]

06:37.271 --> 06:40.650
Look, I'm sure she just, I don't know,
went to the arcade or something.

06:40.733 --> 06:42.026
I'm sure she's fine.

06:42.110 --> 06:43.903
[Neil] You were supposed to watch her.

06:43.986 --> 06:45.780
[sighs] I know, Dad. I was.

06:45.863 --> 06:50.660
It's just you guys were three hours late,
and, well, I have a date. [sighs]

06:51.536 --> 06:52.745
I'm sorry, okay?

06:52.829 --> 06:55.039
That's why you've been
staring at yourself in the mirror

06:55.123 --> 06:57.041
like some faggot
instead of watching your sister?

06:57.125 --> 07:00.253
I have been looking after her
all week, Dad. Okay?

07:00.336 --> 07:02.588
She wants to run off,
then that's her problem, all right?

07:03.256 --> 07:06.592
She's 13 years old.
She shouldn't need a full-time babysitter.

07:06.676 --> 07:08.845
- And she's not my sister!
- [music stops]

07:08.928 --> 07:09.929
[grunts]

07:12.432 --> 07:13.641
[pants]

07:13.724 --> 07:15.643
What did we talk about?

07:17.061 --> 07:18.062
[Billy groans]

07:20.189 --> 07:24.652
What did we... talk about?

07:25.111 --> 07:27.780
Respect and responsibility.

07:27.864 --> 07:29.323
That is right.

07:29.949 --> 07:32.577
Now, apologize to Susan.

07:34.704 --> 07:35.872
[breathing heavily]

07:38.374 --> 07:40.042
I'm sorry, Susan.

07:40.126 --> 07:41.294
It's okay, Neil, really...

07:41.377 --> 07:45.381
No, it's not okay.
Nothing about his behavior is okay.

07:47.008 --> 07:48.801
But he's gonna make up for it.

07:50.845 --> 07:54.140
He's gonna call whatever whore
he's seeing tonight

07:54.223 --> 07:55.558
and cancel their date.

07:56.058 --> 07:59.729
And then he's gonna go find his sister.

08:00.646 --> 08:05.568
Like the good, kind, respecting brother
that he is.

08:06.819 --> 08:08.070
Isn't that right, Billy?

08:09.614 --> 08:10.990
Isn't that right?

08:12.867 --> 08:13.910
[softly] Yes, sir.

08:14.827 --> 08:16.204
[sighs deeply]

08:16.287 --> 08:18.206
I'm sorry, I couldn't hear you.

08:20.458 --> 08:22.627
Yes, sir.

08:24.420 --> 08:25.713
Find Max.

08:30.927 --> 08:32.178
[door closes]

08:36.265 --> 08:37.767
[Lucas] You're positive that was Dart?

08:37.850 --> 08:40.602
[Dustin] Yes. He had the same exact
yellow pattern on his butt.

08:40.686 --> 08:44.148
- He was tiny two days ago.
- Well, he's molted three times already.

08:44.232 --> 08:46.150
- Malted?
- Molted.

08:46.234 --> 08:48.444
Shed his skin to make room for growth
like hornworms.

08:49.028 --> 08:51.614
- [Max] When's he gonna molt again?
- [Dustin] It's gotta be soon.

08:51.697 --> 08:54.367
When he does, he'll be fully grown,
or close to it.

08:54.450 --> 08:55.493
And so will his friends.

08:55.576 --> 08:57.578
Yeah, and he's gonna eat a lot more
than just cats.

08:57.662 --> 08:58.621
Wait, a cat?

08:59.455 --> 09:02.166
- Dart ate a cat?
- No, what? No.

09:02.250 --> 09:03.918
What are you talking about?
He ate Mews.

09:04.001 --> 09:06.003
Mews? Who's Mews?

09:06.087 --> 09:07.255
- It's Dustin's cat.
- Steve!

09:07.338 --> 09:08.673
I knew it! You kept him!

09:08.756 --> 09:09.757
No!

09:10.299 --> 09:11.342
No.

09:11.842 --> 09:13.135
No, I... No, I...

09:14.178 --> 09:15.763
He missed me. He wanted to come home.

09:15.846 --> 09:18.140
- Bullshit!
- I didn't know he was a Demogorgon, okay?

09:18.224 --> 09:20.685
- Oh, so now you admit it?
- Guys, who cares? We have to go.

09:20.768 --> 09:24.397
I care! You put the party in jeopardy!
You broke the rule of law!

09:24.480 --> 09:26.357
- So did you!
- What?

09:26.440 --> 09:27.858
You told a stranger the truth!

09:27.942 --> 09:29.402
[scoffs] A stranger?

09:29.485 --> 09:30.778
You wanted to tell her, too!

09:30.861 --> 09:32.947
- But I didn't, Lucas, okay?
- [screeching in distance]

09:33.030 --> 09:34.657
I didn't tell her!

09:34.740 --> 09:37.827
We both broke the rule of law, okay?
So we're even. We're even.

09:37.910 --> 09:40.329
No, no! We're not even.
Don't even try that.

09:40.413 --> 09:42.832
Your stupid pet
could have ate us for dinner!

09:42.915 --> 09:44.458
- [Dustin] That was not my fault!
- Guys?

09:44.542 --> 09:45.543
He wasn't gonna eat us.

09:45.626 --> 09:47.169
[Lucas] He was crawling
to come say hello?

09:47.253 --> 09:48.546
Guys!

09:48.629 --> 09:50.089
[screeching continues]

09:54.885 --> 09:57.847
[Max] No, no, no. Hey, guys,
why are you headed towards the sound?

09:57.930 --> 09:59.056
Hello?

10:00.016 --> 10:01.183
Hello?

10:10.151 --> 10:11.652
[screeching continues]

10:18.409 --> 10:19.827
[Dustin] I don't see him.

10:26.417 --> 10:27.418
[Lucas] It's the lab.

10:29.420 --> 10:31.255
They were going back home.

10:39.472 --> 10:40.473
[growling]

10:40.556 --> 10:44.560
Look, this is us,
and this is the nearest exit.

10:44.644 --> 10:47.229
But even if we somehow make it there,
there's no way out.

10:47.313 --> 10:49.398
- What do you mean?
- The locks are fail secure.

10:49.482 --> 10:50.441
Fail secure?

10:50.524 --> 10:52.860
If there's a power outage,
the building goes on lockdown.

10:52.943 --> 10:54.320
Can it be unlocked remotely?

10:54.403 --> 10:56.906
With a computer, sure,
but somebody's gotta reset the breakers.

10:56.989 --> 10:59.200
- Where are the breakers?
- Breakers are in the basement,

10:59.283 --> 11:00.451
three floors down.

11:00.868 --> 11:02.078
Hey, where are you going?

11:02.161 --> 11:03.537
To reset the breakers.

11:03.621 --> 11:04.705
Okay, then what?

11:04.789 --> 11:07.333
- Then we get out of here.
- No, then the power comes back on.

11:07.416 --> 11:10.378
If you wanna unlock the doors,
you have to reboot the computer system,

11:10.461 --> 11:13.047
and then override the security codes
with a manual input.

11:14.131 --> 11:15.508
Fine, how do I do that?

11:15.591 --> 11:18.177
You can't. Not unless you know BASIC.

11:18.260 --> 11:19.637
I don't know what that means.

11:19.720 --> 11:21.972
- It's a computer programming language.
- Teach it to me.

11:22.056 --> 11:24.266
[scoffs] Shall I teach you French
while I'm at it, Jim?

11:24.350 --> 11:25.434
How about a little German?

11:26.310 --> 11:28.562
How about you, Doc? You speak BASIC?

11:29.188 --> 11:30.106
No. [sighs]

11:30.189 --> 11:33.067
[scoffs] Okay, I got this.

11:34.527 --> 11:35.528
I got this.

11:35.611 --> 11:37.947
No. Bob.

11:38.864 --> 11:39.949
It's okay.

11:44.203 --> 11:48.916
It's gonna be okay.
Remember, Bob Newby, superhero.

11:48.999 --> 11:50.292
[chuckles lightly]

11:54.797 --> 11:56.257
[Hopper grunting]

11:59.301 --> 12:01.011
Okay, grab his walkie.

12:02.054 --> 12:04.181
[Bob grunting and panting]

12:07.601 --> 12:09.728
All right, you know
how to use one of these?

12:09.812 --> 12:12.731
[panting] No.

12:14.900 --> 12:19.280
Safety on. Safety off. Point. Squeeze.

12:20.531 --> 12:22.992
Point and squeeze. Okay. Easy-peasy.

12:23.826 --> 12:27.079
If anything happens down there,
I want you to come right back up.

12:27.163 --> 12:28.747
Right back here. Listen.

12:30.040 --> 12:33.127
Don't wait for me.
As soon as I get those doors open...

12:33.210 --> 12:35.087
- I'm gonna get them out.
- Yeah?

12:35.171 --> 12:36.505
I promise.

12:37.298 --> 12:39.675
Okay, well... I'll be in touch.

12:53.147 --> 12:54.523
[Jonathan] Why are the lights off?

12:55.232 --> 12:56.442
[Nancy] Maybe it's closed?

12:56.525 --> 12:58.110
[Jonathan] Security took the night off?

12:58.194 --> 12:59.737
I don't think so.

13:06.160 --> 13:07.161
[Nancy] It's not working?

13:07.244 --> 13:09.079
No! The power's off.

13:10.581 --> 13:12.541
- Jonathan?
- What?

13:12.625 --> 13:14.043
[rustling]

13:15.461 --> 13:17.546
I think there's something in the woods.

13:17.630 --> 13:19.590
[whispering] Nancy, stay back.

13:22.676 --> 13:23.969
Hello?

13:25.054 --> 13:26.263
Who's there?

13:26.847 --> 13:28.182
Who's there?

13:32.895 --> 13:34.104
[both] Steve?

13:34.188 --> 13:35.773
- Nancy?
- Jonathan.

13:35.856 --> 13:37.733
What are you doing here?

13:37.816 --> 13:38.776
What are you doing here?

13:38.859 --> 13:40.736
We're looking for Mike and Will.

13:40.820 --> 13:43.447
They're not in there, are they?
- We're not sure.

13:43.531 --> 13:44.406
Why?

13:44.490 --> 13:46.075
[monsters screeching]

14:16.772 --> 14:18.983
- [air hissing]
- [grunts]

14:19.066 --> 14:20.693
[panting]

14:22.653 --> 14:23.988
Keep it together, Bob.

14:32.454 --> 14:33.873
[gasps]

14:35.165 --> 14:36.542
Oh, God.

14:36.625 --> 14:38.377
[panting]

14:49.138 --> 14:50.431
[grunts]

14:56.687 --> 14:59.773
Okay, here we go. [grunts]

15:03.068 --> 15:03.903
[grunts]

15:13.454 --> 15:14.955
He made it.

15:15.039 --> 15:16.790
[indistinct chatter]

15:18.083 --> 15:20.336
- We haven't seen Will...
- I haven't seen him since...

15:20.419 --> 15:22.129
The power's back.

15:32.723 --> 15:34.183
- [Dustin] Let me try.
- Hang on...

15:34.266 --> 15:36.560
Let me try, Jonathan!

15:41.357 --> 15:42.650
Son of a bitch! You know what...

15:43.400 --> 15:46.028
- [beeps]
- Okay, Bob, can you hear us?

15:46.111 --> 15:48.614
Loud and clear, Doc.
Can you hear me back?

15:48.697 --> 15:49.823
[Owens] We hear you.

15:49.907 --> 15:51.700
All right, give me a minute.

15:57.581 --> 15:58.415
[computer beeps]

16:04.505 --> 16:05.673
Open sesame.

16:06.256 --> 16:07.883
[buzzing]

16:08.550 --> 16:09.843
It's open.

16:11.220 --> 16:12.346
Okay.

16:15.975 --> 16:17.810
Hey! I got it! [chuckles]

16:18.519 --> 16:19.520
I got it!

16:21.730 --> 16:22.940
Easy-peasy.

16:23.524 --> 16:25.150
Son of a bitch did it.

16:25.234 --> 16:26.485
Right, I'll meet you outside.

16:27.152 --> 16:28.278
Nice job.

16:29.989 --> 16:31.699
- Hold on a second, Chief.
- What's wrong?

16:31.782 --> 16:33.826
West stairwell's not clear anymore.

16:34.952 --> 16:37.955
- What's going on?
- We've got some company.

16:38.038 --> 16:40.332
- Where?
- The west stairwell.

16:40.416 --> 16:41.709
I got an idea.

16:46.672 --> 16:47.715
What the hell's he doing?

16:48.424 --> 16:51.093
Okay. And splash.

16:54.930 --> 16:55.931
[monster chittering]

16:58.809 --> 17:01.353
Okay. Okay, that worked.

17:01.437 --> 17:02.771
Now, get out of there.

17:02.855 --> 17:04.356
Go! Go!

17:07.984 --> 17:09.111
[grunts]

17:09.944 --> 17:11.195
Wait a second, Chief?

17:11.280 --> 17:12.489
- What?
- Take this.

17:13.240 --> 17:15.909
- What are you doing?
- Any more surprises, I'll let you know.

17:15.992 --> 17:18.787
- Go. Go!
- [sighs]

17:26.545 --> 17:28.338
[panting]

17:38.348 --> 17:40.225
Come on, Bob. Come on.

17:42.144 --> 17:43.228
[Owens] Hey, Bob?

17:44.146 --> 17:45.022
Yeah?

17:45.481 --> 17:47.691
- I'm gonna guide you, okay?
- Is there a problem?

17:47.775 --> 17:50.778
No, it's just... It's, uh, getting
a little crowded up here,

17:50.861 --> 17:52.488
so we're gonna have to take this slow.

17:53.155 --> 17:54.406
Okay.

17:54.490 --> 17:56.200
All right, just start walking.

17:59.119 --> 18:00.829
Okay, good.

18:05.292 --> 18:07.127
Okay, now, your next right.

18:11.048 --> 18:14.134
Now, keep going, keep going, keep going...

18:14.218 --> 18:15.928
[panting]

18:20.724 --> 18:21.558
Stop!

18:21.642 --> 18:23.769
[panting]

18:23.852 --> 18:24.853
What?

18:26.855 --> 18:27.856
What?

18:28.440 --> 18:31.068
Bob, there's a door on your left,
do you see that?

18:33.112 --> 18:33.946
[Bob] Yeah?

18:34.905 --> 18:36.949
- That's a closet.
- Okay?

18:37.032 --> 18:39.409
- Yeah, I need you to get in it.
- What?

18:40.869 --> 18:43.163
Now! Right now. Get in the closet.

18:47.584 --> 18:49.586
[panting]

18:51.505 --> 18:53.674
[monster growling softly]

19:03.892 --> 19:05.477
[monster growling]

19:17.656 --> 19:20.075
[gasping]

19:20.784 --> 19:22.452
Jesus Christ.

19:23.162 --> 19:24.163
Okay.

19:24.872 --> 19:26.748
How you holding up there, Bob?
You all right?

19:28.000 --> 19:29.668
Yeah. Yeah.

19:31.170 --> 19:33.589
You got a pretty clear shot
to the front door.

19:35.090 --> 19:36.133
Okay.

19:36.216 --> 19:37.718
You can do this, okay?

19:38.468 --> 19:40.554
You're almost home free, all right, Bob?

19:40.637 --> 19:42.389
[panting]

19:59.281 --> 20:00.949
[thudding]

20:18.800 --> 20:20.093
Run!

20:23.680 --> 20:25.307
[monster screeches]

20:26.058 --> 20:27.142
[screams]

20:29.937 --> 20:30.938
[growling]

20:34.399 --> 20:35.817
[monster screeching]

20:37.069 --> 20:38.153
Bob!

20:38.237 --> 20:39.780
- [panting]
- Bob.

20:44.868 --> 20:46.245
[screeching]

20:46.328 --> 20:47.496
[screaming]

20:54.336 --> 20:56.046
[screaming]

20:58.674 --> 21:00.884
No!

21:06.556 --> 21:08.016
No!

21:24.408 --> 21:25.325
[Hopper] Go!

21:28.996 --> 21:30.622
No!

21:30.706 --> 21:32.040
Go!

21:32.124 --> 21:33.375
[Joyce] Bob!

21:35.127 --> 21:37.379
- [door buzzing]
- Bob!

21:38.714 --> 21:40.048
No!

21:40.132 --> 21:42.134
- What happened?
- No!

21:42.217 --> 21:44.344
- [screeching]
- [Joyce] No!

21:44.428 --> 21:47.431
- He's gone! He's gone!
- [horn honking]

21:49.349 --> 21:51.435
Come on! Get in!

21:57.316 --> 21:58.150
[screeches]

22:02.279 --> 22:03.280
Guys?

22:06.616 --> 22:07.784
[horn honking]

22:13.123 --> 22:13.957
Let's go.

22:15.292 --> 22:16.126
Come on!

22:17.294 --> 22:19.504
Come on, let's go! Let's go!
Come on!

22:22.841 --> 22:24.676
[monsters growling]

22:59.836 --> 23:01.671
I'm sorry, bud.

23:03.340 --> 23:06.426
Sorry I wasn't there.
I should have been here.

23:06.510 --> 23:10.013
- [Hopper] Sam Owens. Dr. Sam Owens.
- [woman] How many people at the lab?

23:10.097 --> 23:11.848
I don't know how many people are there!

23:11.932 --> 23:13.975
I don't know how many people
are left alive!

23:14.059 --> 23:17.896
- Have you contacted the police?
- I am the police! Chief Jim Hopper!

23:17.979 --> 23:19.773
Is there a number I can reach you at?

23:19.856 --> 23:21.817
Yes, the number that I gave you, yes.

23:21.900 --> 23:23.443
- Okay, yes, I got it.
- 6767...

23:23.527 --> 23:26.154
- I will be here.
- I'll have them contact you.

23:28.698 --> 23:30.075
They didn't believe you, did they?

23:31.827 --> 23:32.702
We'll see.

23:32.786 --> 23:36.456
"We'll see"? We can't just sit here
while those things are loose!

23:36.540 --> 23:39.042
We stay here, and we wait for help.

23:52.597 --> 23:53.890
[knocks softly]

24:15.579 --> 24:16.872
[grunts softly]

25:10.800 --> 25:13.720
Did you guys know that Bob was
the original founder of Hawkins AV?

25:14.971 --> 25:15.805
Really?

25:16.848 --> 25:18.975
He petitioned the school
to start it and everything.

25:19.059 --> 25:20.852
Then he had a fund-raiser for equipment.

25:22.270 --> 25:24.522
Mr. Clarke learned everything from him.

25:25.899 --> 25:26.983
Pretty awesome, right?

25:27.067 --> 25:28.151
[Dustin and Lucas] Yeah.

25:31.696 --> 25:32.948
We can't let him die in vain.

25:33.031 --> 25:34.366
What do you want to do, Mike?

25:34.449 --> 25:35.659
The Chief's right on this.

25:35.742 --> 25:37.577
We can't stop those Demo-dogs on our own.

25:37.661 --> 25:38.703
Demo-dogs?

25:40.288 --> 25:42.707
Demogorgon dogs.

25:44.167 --> 25:45.168
Demo-dogs.

25:45.252 --> 25:46.544
It's like a compound.

25:46.628 --> 25:48.380
It's like a play on words...

25:48.463 --> 25:49.381
Okay.

25:52.008 --> 25:54.761
- I mean, when it was just Dart, maybe...
- But there's an army now.

25:54.844 --> 25:56.763
- [Dustin] Precisely.
- His army.

25:57.555 --> 25:58.473
What do you mean?

25:59.057 --> 26:00.058
His army.

26:01.142 --> 26:04.062
Maybe if we stop him,
we can stop his army, too.

26:08.817 --> 26:11.319
- [Dustin] The shadow monster.
- It got Will that day on the field.

26:11.403 --> 26:13.446
The doctor said it was like a virus,
it infected him.

26:13.530 --> 26:16.324
And so this virus,
it's connecting him to the tunnels?

26:16.408 --> 26:18.451
To the tunnels, monsters,
the Upside Down, everything.

26:18.535 --> 26:20.412
Whoa. Slow down. Slow down.

26:20.495 --> 26:22.622
Okay, so,
the shadow monster's inside everything.

26:22.706 --> 26:25.542
And if the vines feel something like pain,
then so does Will.

26:25.625 --> 26:28.086
- And so does Dart.
- Yeah. Like what Mr. Clarke taught us.

26:28.169 --> 26:29.838
- The hive mind.
- Hive mind?

26:29.921 --> 26:32.257
A collective consciousness.
It's a super-organism.

26:32.340 --> 26:35.093
And this is the thing that
controls everything. It's the brain.

26:35.677 --> 26:36.803
Like the mind flayer.

26:38.722 --> 26:40.765
- [Max] The what?
- What?

26:42.642 --> 26:43.977
The mind flayer.

26:44.060 --> 26:45.270
What the hell is that?

26:45.353 --> 26:46.980
It's a monster from an unknown dimension.

26:47.063 --> 26:49.691
It's so ancient
that it doesn't even know its true home.

26:49.774 --> 26:51.985
Okay, it enslaves races
of other dimensions

26:52.068 --> 26:54.946
by taking over their brains using
its highly-developed psionic powers.

26:55.030 --> 26:58.033
Oh, my God, none of this is real.
This is a kids' game.

26:58.116 --> 27:00.535
No, it's a manual. And it's not for kids.

27:00.618 --> 27:02.954
And unless you know something
that we don't,

27:03.038 --> 27:04.331
this is the best metaphor...

27:04.414 --> 27:05.498
Analogy.

27:05.582 --> 27:07.792
Analogy? That's what you're worried about?

27:07.876 --> 27:11.129
Fine. An analogy for understanding
whatever the hell this is.

27:11.212 --> 27:13.256
Okay, so this mind flamer thing...

27:13.340 --> 27:14.966
- Flayer. Mind flayer.
- [sighs]

27:15.050 --> 27:16.134
What does it want?

27:16.217 --> 27:17.594
To conquer us, basically.

27:17.677 --> 27:19.429
It believes it's the master race.

27:19.512 --> 27:20.847
[stammers] Like the Germans?

27:20.930 --> 27:22.682
Uh, the Nazis?

27:23.933 --> 27:26.186
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, the Nazis.
- Uh...

27:26.269 --> 27:28.646
If the Nazis were
from another dimension, totally.

27:28.730 --> 27:33.943
Uh, it views other races, like us,
as inferior to itself.

27:34.027 --> 27:35.904
It wants to spread,
take over other dimensions.

27:35.987 --> 27:39.240
We are talking about the destruction
of our world as we know it.

27:39.324 --> 27:41.868
That's great. That's great.
That's really great. Jesus!

27:42.577 --> 27:47.832
Okay, so if this thing is like a brain
that's controlling everything,

27:47.916 --> 27:49.626
then if we kill it...

27:49.709 --> 27:51.336
We kill everything it controls.

27:51.419 --> 27:53.505
- We win.
- Theoretically.

27:53.588 --> 27:56.508
Great. So how do you kill this thing?
Shoot it with Fireballs or something?

27:56.591 --> 27:58.426
[chuckles] No. No, no Fire... No Fireballs.

27:58.510 --> 28:01.805
Uh, you summon an undead army,
uh, because...

28:01.888 --> 28:05.058
[stammering]...because zombies,
you know, they don't have brains,

28:05.141 --> 28:08.770
and the mind flayer, it... it...
It likes brains.

28:08.853 --> 28:11.398
- It's just a game. It's a game.
- What the hell are we doing here?

28:11.481 --> 28:14.109
I thought we were waiting
for your military backup.

28:14.192 --> 28:15.402
We are!

28:15.485 --> 28:16.861
How are they gonna stop this?

28:16.945 --> 28:18.363
You can't just shoot this with guns.

28:18.446 --> 28:20.490
You don't know that!
We don't know anything!

28:20.573 --> 28:22.742
We know it's already killed
everybody in that lab.

28:22.826 --> 28:24.536
We know the monsters are gonna molt again.

28:24.619 --> 28:28.039
We know that it's only a matter of time
before those tunnels reach this town.

28:28.123 --> 28:29.999
[Joyce] They're right.

28:31.501 --> 28:33.253
We have to kill it.

28:34.712 --> 28:36.923
I want to kill it.

28:37.006 --> 28:37.841
- Me, too.
- I...

28:37.924 --> 28:39.384
Me, too, Joyce, okay?

28:39.467 --> 28:40.552
But how do we do that?

28:40.635 --> 28:42.929
We don't exactly know
what we're dealing with here.

28:43.012 --> 28:44.931
[Mike] No. But he does.

28:46.975 --> 28:49.728
If anyone knows
how to destroy this thing, it's Will.

28:49.811 --> 28:52.564
He's connected to it.
He'll know its weakness.

28:52.647 --> 28:54.566
[Max] I thought
we couldn't trust him anymore.

28:54.649 --> 28:58.153
That he's a spy for the mind flayer now.

28:58.236 --> 29:02.031
Yeah, but he can't spy
if he doesn't know where he is.

29:07.871 --> 29:08.872
Yeah, this'll work.

29:10.915 --> 29:12.417
[grunting]

29:32.604 --> 29:33.521
Hey.

29:35.064 --> 29:37.776
What you did, um, helping the kids...

29:39.152 --> 29:42.655
that was... really cool.

29:43.239 --> 29:44.199
Yeah.

29:45.533 --> 29:47.827
Those little shits are real trouble,
you know?

29:48.578 --> 29:50.371
Believe me, I know.

30:04.886 --> 30:06.262
[Dustin] Hey.

30:06.346 --> 30:09.015
I'm... I'm sorry about Dart and all.

30:09.974 --> 30:13.228
I guess I just thought
that he was my friend.

30:13.812 --> 30:15.355
I was wrong.

30:16.689 --> 30:18.316
I broke the rule of law,

30:18.399 --> 30:23.196
so if you want your girlfriend to take
over my spot in the party, I understand.

30:23.279 --> 30:25.323
She's not my girlfriend.

30:25.406 --> 30:27.617
I saw you two
holding hands in the bus, Lucas.

30:27.700 --> 30:29.536
She was just scared.

30:29.619 --> 30:31.329
Maybe, but I could feel it.

30:31.412 --> 30:32.622
Feel what?

30:33.665 --> 30:35.375
The electricity.

30:44.968 --> 30:45.969
[sighs]

30:51.683 --> 30:53.768
I get why El was your mage now.

30:54.394 --> 30:55.228
What?

30:55.311 --> 30:58.356
Lucas. He told me all about her.

30:58.439 --> 30:59.399
Well, he shouldn't have.

31:00.859 --> 31:03.695
And just because you know the truth,
it doesn't mean you're in our party.

31:03.778 --> 31:04.988
You do know that, right?

31:05.071 --> 31:06.281
Yeah, I know.

31:08.616 --> 31:12.620
I mean, why would you want a stupid zoomer
in your party anyway?

31:14.372 --> 31:16.291
I'm just saying, El?

31:17.166 --> 31:18.835
She sounds like she was really awesome.

31:18.918 --> 31:21.254
Yeah, she was.

31:22.422 --> 31:24.632
Until that thing took her.

31:25.550 --> 31:27.176
Just like it took Bob.

31:33.975 --> 31:35.643
You sure this is gonna work?

31:35.727 --> 31:37.478
He knew who I was.

31:38.062 --> 31:39.272
He's still in there.

31:40.064 --> 31:41.941
It's gonna work.

31:42.025 --> 31:43.484
It has to.

32:33.326 --> 32:35.536
- All right, you ready?
- [Joyce] Yeah.

32:48.466 --> 32:49.717
[gasps]

33:15.743 --> 33:17.578
If he finds out where we are...

33:18.871 --> 33:20.832
will he send those dogs after us?

33:21.791 --> 33:24.085
He won't find out.

33:25.503 --> 33:29.048
Yeah, but, if he does...

33:32.719 --> 33:34.220
Judgment day.

33:46.566 --> 33:50.069
[grunts] What? What? What is this?

33:53.865 --> 33:55.324
What? What is this?

33:56.451 --> 33:57.577
Why am I tied up?

33:58.870 --> 34:01.247
Will, we just wanna talk to you.

34:01.330 --> 34:02.623
We're not gonna hurt you.

34:02.707 --> 34:03.833
Where am I?

34:05.084 --> 34:06.919
You recognize this?

34:07.003 --> 34:08.920
Do you recognize this?

34:09.630 --> 34:10.715
[Joyce] Hey.

34:10.797 --> 34:12.550
We wanna help you.

34:12.632 --> 34:15.136
But to do that,
we have to understand how to kill it.

34:15.219 --> 34:16.721
Why am I tied up?

34:16.804 --> 34:18.764
Why am I tied up?

34:18.848 --> 34:21.309
Why am I tied up? Why am I tied up?

34:21.391 --> 34:22.310
[Hopper] Hey.

34:22.393 --> 34:24.603
Why am I tied up? Why am I tied up?

34:24.687 --> 34:29.275
Let me go! Let me go! Let me go!
Let me go!

34:34.322 --> 34:37.449
[screams] Let me go! Let me go! Let me go!

34:37.533 --> 34:42.789
Let me go! Let me go! Let me go!
Let me go!

34:42.871 --> 34:46.417
Let me go! Let me go! Let me go!

34:46.501 --> 34:48.085
Let me go...

34:49.170 --> 34:50.213
Go...

34:53.382 --> 34:54.801
Go...

35:06.729 --> 35:09.190
Do you know what March 22nd is?

35:10.858 --> 35:12.527
It's your birthday.

35:14.070 --> 35:15.696
Your birthday.

35:18.741 --> 35:24.330
When you turned eight,
I gave you that huge box of crayons.

35:24.413 --> 35:25.957
Do you remember that?

35:26.040 --> 35:28.417
It was 120 colors.

35:30.878 --> 35:35.216
And all your friends,
they got you Star Wars toys,

35:36.175 --> 35:41.013
but all you wanted to do was draw
with all your new colors.

35:43.057 --> 35:47.812
And you drew this big spaceship,
but it wasn't from a movie.

35:47.895 --> 35:49.939
[stammers] It was your spaceship.

35:50.022 --> 35:52.775
A rainbow ship is what you called it.

35:53.901 --> 35:58.489
And you must have used
every color in the box.

36:01.325 --> 36:05.121
I took that with me to Melvald's

36:05.204 --> 36:11.002
and I put it up
and I told everyone who came in,

36:11.085 --> 36:13.337
"My son drew this."

36:15.298 --> 36:16.883
And you were so embarrassed. [chuckles]

36:20.052 --> 36:22.054
But I was so proud.

36:23.181 --> 36:26.100
I was so, so proud.

36:29.228 --> 36:31.272
[breathing shakily]

36:31.355 --> 36:33.107
Do you remember the day Dad left?

36:38.654 --> 36:41.574
We stayed up all night
building Castle Byers...

36:42.658 --> 36:44.952
just the way you drew it.

36:45.036 --> 36:49.957
And it took so long
because you were so bad at hammering.

36:50.041 --> 36:51.542
[both chuckle]

36:52.210 --> 36:53.920
You'd miss the nail every time.

36:55.922 --> 37:00.218
And then it started raining,
but we stayed out there anyway.

37:00.927 --> 37:03.846
We were both sick
for like a week after that.

37:03.930 --> 37:06.682
But we just had to finish it, didn't we?

37:08.100 --> 37:09.769
We just had to.

37:10.645 --> 37:12.772
[Mike] Do you remember
the first day that we met?

37:15.233 --> 37:18.527
It was... It was
the first day of kindergarten.

37:19.570 --> 37:21.113
I knew nobody.

37:22.073 --> 37:24.408
I had no friends and...

37:26.702 --> 37:32.208
[sniffling] I just felt so alone
and so scared, but...

37:34.502 --> 37:38.965
I saw you on the swings
and you were alone, too.

37:40.049 --> 37:41.801
You were just swinging by yourself.

37:42.927 --> 37:46.472
And I just walked up to you and...

37:47.473 --> 37:48.683
I asked.

37:49.725 --> 37:51.978
I asked if you wanted to be my friend.

37:53.020 --> 37:55.147
And you said yes.

37:56.691 --> 37:58.234
You said yes.

38:01.696 --> 38:04.323
It was the best thing I've ever done.

38:10.788 --> 38:13.040
Will, baby...

38:15.710 --> 38:20.256
if you're in there, just please...
please talk to us.

38:20.840 --> 38:24.135
Please, honey, please,
can you do that for me?

38:24.844 --> 38:27.930
- Please. I love you so much.
- [breathing shakily]

38:35.646 --> 38:36.731
Let me go.

38:38.107 --> 38:40.401
- [Joyce sighs]
- [Mike sniffles]

38:43.404 --> 38:45.156
[tapping]

38:55.541 --> 38:56.792
[Dustin] What happened?

38:56.876 --> 39:01.589
[sighs] I think he's talking,
just not with words.

39:04.633 --> 39:05.468
[Steve] What is that?

39:05.551 --> 39:06.427
[boys] Morse code.

39:06.510 --> 39:08.304
H- E-R-E.

39:08.387 --> 39:09.388
Here.

39:11.349 --> 39:14.852
Will's still in there. He's talking to us.

39:25.738 --> 39:28.366
["Should I Stay Or Should I Go?" playing]

39:31.035 --> 39:33.037
Do you remember
the first time I played you this?

39:33.120 --> 39:35.706
Mom and Dad were both arguing
in the next room.

39:35.790 --> 39:37.375
So I played you the mix tape I made you.

39:37.958 --> 39:40.795
And it was the first time
you got into music. Real music.

39:43.631 --> 39:46.592
Dash, dot, dash, dot.

39:47.176 --> 39:48.761
- Yeah, got it.
- C.

39:50.596 --> 39:52.765
And then the party
escaped into the sewers,

39:52.848 --> 39:56.143
and there were those big insect things,
and you guys were still on level one.

39:56.227 --> 39:57.853
[beeping]

39:58.562 --> 40:00.231
L.

40:01.273 --> 40:02.233
O.

40:02.316 --> 40:04.860
Then you cast Fog Cloud and you saved us.

40:04.944 --> 40:06.654
You saved the whole party.

40:06.737 --> 40:09.031
- [beeping]
- S.

40:09.115 --> 40:11.909
You saw that little girl
and she was in the sandbox

40:11.992 --> 40:13.077
and she was crying.

40:13.160 --> 40:14.537
E.

40:14.620 --> 40:16.080
You gave him your Tonka Truck

40:16.664 --> 40:19.375
and I told you
we couldn't afford to buy another one.

40:19.458 --> 40:21.001
G.

40:21.085 --> 40:22.962
You said she should have it
because she's sad.

40:23.045 --> 40:24.171
"She's sad, Mommy."

40:24.255 --> 40:25.756
A.

40:25.840 --> 40:27.633
- I love you so much.
- T.

40:27.716 --> 40:29.760
So, so much.

40:29.844 --> 40:31.262
E.

40:34.473 --> 40:36.183
[all] "Close gate."

40:36.267 --> 40:37.768
[phone ringing]

40:39.395 --> 40:41.647
Shit. Shit.

40:45.317 --> 40:46.694
[telephone continues ringing]

40:47.528 --> 40:48.696
[grunts]

40:50.489 --> 40:52.741
- [sighs]
- [Max] Do you think he heard that?

40:52.825 --> 40:56.662
It's just a phone. It could be anywhere.
Right?

41:00.749 --> 41:03.669
- Hey. Hey, can you hear me?
- [breathing heavily]

41:07.089 --> 41:08.174
[panting]

41:12.595 --> 41:15.306
It knows. It knows where we are.

41:16.557 --> 41:17.558
[Joyce] Oh, shit.

41:26.942 --> 41:28.652
[monsters screeching in distance]

41:35.618 --> 41:37.161
That's not good.

41:37.244 --> 41:39.205
- [Jonathan] They're coming!
- What?

41:39.288 --> 41:41.290
- [Hopper] Come on. We gotta go.
- [Jonathan] Come on.

41:41.373 --> 41:43.334
- [Hopper] We gotta go.
- Okay.

41:44.168 --> 41:46.378
Come on, come on. Let's go. Let's go.

42:04.355 --> 42:06.482
Hey. Hey, get away from the windows!

42:09.735 --> 42:11.779
- Do you know how to use this?
- What?

42:11.862 --> 42:13.656
Can you use this?

42:13.739 --> 42:15.241
I can.

42:23.332 --> 42:25.209
[screeching in distance]

42:25.292 --> 42:26.293
[Max] Where are they?

42:30.089 --> 42:32.341
[monsters growling]

42:37.596 --> 42:38.847
[loud thudding]

42:40.015 --> 42:40.975
What are they doing?

42:49.900 --> 42:51.402
[snarling]

42:58.033 --> 42:59.660
[monster groaning]

43:01.287 --> 43:02.746
[monster screeching]

43:05.207 --> 43:06.292
[screeching stops abruptly]

43:09.962 --> 43:11.380
[screeches]

43:11.463 --> 43:12.923
[all scream]

43:24.143 --> 43:25.477
[Dustin] Holy shit.

43:27.438 --> 43:28.439
Is it dead?

43:37.740 --> 43:38.991
[door creaks]

44:39.551 --> 44:41.553
