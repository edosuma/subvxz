WEBVTT

00:13.410 --> 00:15.628
HOW MUCH FARTH ER?

00:15.680 --> 00:16.647
WHAT?

00:16.680 --> 00:17.669
ARE WE ALMOST DONE?

00:17.710 --> 00:19.541
YOU WANT TO STOP?

00:19.580 --> 00:21.810
NO.

00:21.850 --> 00:25.183
LET'S REST A WHILE.

00:25.220 --> 00:28.519
I PROMISED I WOULDN'T
SLOW YOU DOWN.

00:28.560 --> 00:31.120
YOU GO AHEAD.
I'LL CATCH UP.

00:31.160 --> 00:32.388
I CAN WAIT.

00:32.430 --> 00:33.556
ADAM, PLEASE.

00:33.600 --> 00:35.352
IT'S YOUR WORKOUT.

00:35.400 --> 00:39.496
GO. I'LL MEET YOU
AT THE POINT.

00:42.440 --> 00:44.806
YOU'RE OUT OF SHAPE,
CHEERLEADER.

00:44.840 --> 00:45.465
OH, YEAH?

00:45.510 --> 00:47.330
LET'S SEE YOU DO
3 BACK FLIPS

00:47.380 --> 00:48.699
AND LAND
IN THE SPLITS.

00:48.740 --> 00:50.571
THE POINT?

00:50.610 --> 00:53.443
THE POINT.

01:37.160 --> 01:39.492
HELLO?

01:43.600 --> 01:46.660
IS SOMEBODY THERE?

01:47.640 --> 01:48.629
ADAM...

01:48.670 --> 01:52.106
IF YOU'RE TRYING
TO SCARE ME,
I'M GONNA KILL YOU.

02:45.230 --> 02:47.152
ADAM?

02:51.700 --> 02:54.760
ADAM. ADAM!

02:55.970 --> 02:58.507
ADAM!
OH, MY GOD.

02:58.540 --> 02:59.768
OH, MY GOD.
OH, MY GOD.

02:59.810 --> 03:00.674
ADAM, PLEASE
WAKE UP.

03:00.710 --> 03:02.541
ADAM, BABY.
PLEASE, BABY.

03:02.580 --> 03:04.673
PLEASE!

03:09.320 --> 03:10.810
NOOOO!

03:29.770 --> 03:32.409
VICTIM'S THE LLOYD
BOY, ISN'T IT?

03:32.440 --> 03:34.374
THE QUARTERBACK?

03:34.410 --> 03:35.604
ADAM.

03:35.640 --> 03:37.278
JUST SAW HIS PARENTS
YESTERDAY.

03:37.310 --> 03:38.277
THEY WERE HEADING
UP TO NANTUCKET.

03:38.310 --> 03:41.609
LISTEN GET ME
THEIR NUMBER UP THERE,
WILL YOU?

03:41.650 --> 03:42.685
SHERIFF BRIDGES.

03:42.720 --> 03:44.688
THERE'S SOMETHING HERE.

03:44.720 --> 03:45.482
WHAT IS IT?

03:45.520 --> 03:48.683
YOU'RE GONNA WANT
TO SEE THIS, SIR.

04:09.780 --> 04:11.668
LOOKS LIKE THE HEAD
IS BUSTED OPEN.

04:11.710 --> 04:13.746
JUST LIKE ADAM LLOYD.

04:13.780 --> 04:16.317
YOU WANT ME TO GET
THE CRIME SCENE FOLKS
DOWN HERE?

04:16.350 --> 04:18.682
YEAH.

04:19.660 --> 04:22.584
WAIT. HOLD ON.

04:28.830 --> 04:29.990
WE'RE GONNA NEED
A LOT MORE

04:30.030 --> 04:33.568
THAN THE CRIME
SCENE FOLKS.

04:36.470 --> 04:38.961
EASY THERE, TOUGH GUY.
HAVE SOME COFFEE
WITH YOUR SUGAR.

04:39.010 --> 04:40.932
I NEED SOMETHING
TO WAKE ME UP.

04:40.980 --> 04:42.572
OOH. LATE NIGHT?

04:42.610 --> 04:43.975
VERY.

04:44.010 --> 04:45.045
MY MAN.

04:45.080 --> 04:46.741
NOT THAT KIND OF
LATE NIGHT.

04:48.680 --> 04:49.612
OK, SO TELL ME,

04:49.650 --> 04:52.016
WHAT DOES KEEP
YOUNG DR. REID
AWAKE AT NIGHT?

04:52.050 --> 04:53.085
WAIT, LET ME GUESS.

04:53.120 --> 04:56.385
MEMORIZING SOME
OBSCURE TEXTBOOK.
NO, NO, NO, NO.

04:56.430 --> 04:57.886
WORKING ON COLD FUSION.

04:57.930 --> 04:59.727
NO, I GOT IT.
I GOT IT. I GOT IT.

04:59.760 --> 05:00.795
WATCHING STAR TREK...

05:00.830 --> 05:02.559
AND LAUGHING AT
THE PHYSICS MISTAKES.

05:02.600 --> 05:05.694
ACTUALLY, THERE
AREN'T THAT MANY
SCIENTIFIC ERRORS

05:05.730 --> 05:06.697
IN STAR TREK.

05:06.740 --> 05:07.889
ESPECIALLY CONSIDERING
HOW LONG AGO IT WAS MADE.

05:07.940 --> 05:10.363
THERE ARE CERTAIN
IM PROBABILITI ES,

05:10.410 --> 05:14.528
BUT NOT THAT MANY
OUTRIGHT ERRORS.

05:14.580 --> 05:17.003
RIGHT.

05:17.050 --> 05:20.019
HEY, MORGAN?

05:20.050 --> 05:23.884
UH, DO YOU EVER
HAVE DREAMS?

05:23.920 --> 05:25.046
I'M SORRY.

05:25.090 --> 05:29.925
I GUESS NIGHTMARES
WOULD BE A MORE
ACCURATE DESCRIPTION.

05:29.960 --> 05:31.484
IS THAT WHAT'S
KEEPING YOU UP?

05:31.530 --> 05:32.952
I USED TO GET THEM
OCCASIONALLY,

05:33.000 --> 05:35.958
BUT LATELY IT'S LIKE
I HAVE THEM EVERY NIGHT.

05:36.000 --> 05:38.025
WHAT ARE THEY ABOUT?
THIS.

05:38.070 --> 05:41.039
WHAT WE DO.

05:41.070 --> 05:42.958
DO YOU HAVE
NIGHTMARES?

05:43.010 --> 05:45.433
REID, I'M NOT SURE
IF I'M THE RIGHT PERSON

05:45.470 --> 05:47.074
FOR YOU TO TALK TO
ABOUT THIS.

05:47.110 --> 05:48.008
WHY NOT?

05:48.040 --> 05:50.144
IT'S JUST, UH...

05:50.180 --> 05:51.943
DID YOU ASK GIDEON
ABOUT IT?

05:51.980 --> 05:53.868
NO.
YOU SHOULD.

05:53.920 --> 05:59.984
HEY, HOTCH WANTS EVERYONE
IN THE ROUND TABLE ROOM.

06:00.620 --> 06:02.110
SOMETHING UP
WITH YOU TWO?

06:02.160 --> 06:04.481
NO.

06:10.130 --> 06:11.119
MCALLISTER.

06:11.170 --> 06:13.138
WESTERN SLOPE OF
MASSANUTI'EN MOUNTAIN
IN VIRGINIA.

06:13.170 --> 06:14.535
2 BODIES DISCOVERED
IN THE WOODS,

06:14.570 --> 06:17.164
BOTH WITH APPARENT
BLUNT TRAUMA
TO THE HEAD.

06:17.210 --> 06:18.404
SKELETONS?

06:18.440 --> 06:20.579
ONE OF THEM. THE SECOND
VICTIM WAS JUST KILLED
THIS MORNING.

06:20.610 --> 06:21.702
HOW DO WE KNOW
THERE'S A CONNECTION?

06:21.740 --> 06:23.401
THEY WERE FOUND ABOUT
75 FEET APART

06:23.450 --> 06:24.178
WITH NEARLY IDENTICAL
HEAD WOUNDS.

06:24.210 --> 06:25.438
WHERE'S THE REST
OF THE CASE FILE?

06:25.480 --> 06:27.948
THERE ISN'T ONE.
THE SHERIFFS ARE ON THE
SCENE WAITING FOR US.

06:27.980 --> 06:30.710
THEIR LOCATION IS ONLY
A HALF HOUR AWAY BY PLANE.

06:30.750 --> 06:31.512
WHAT'S THE RUSH?

06:31.550 --> 06:33.108
WELL, THERE WAS EVIDENCE
ON THE SCENE

06:33.160 --> 06:35.811
THAT COULD CAUSE A BIT
OF A PUBLIC UPROAR.

06:35.860 --> 06:38.158
A SATANIC CULT.

07:08.020 --> 07:12.753
CAPTIONING MADE POSSIBLE BY
TOUCHSTONE TELEVISION
PRODUCTIONS, LLC AND CBS

07:19.700 --> 07:21.190
SO PETER USTINOV
SAID, "UNFORTUNATELY,

07:21.240 --> 07:27.907
A SUPER-ABUNDANCE OF DREAMS
IS PAID FOR BY A GROWING
POTENTIAL FOR NIGHTMARES."

07:27.940 --> 07:30.977
JJ, WE NEED TO
OBVIOUSLY, KEEP THIS
OUT OF THE PRESS

07:31.010 --> 07:31.999
FOR AS LONG AS POSSIBLE.

07:32.050 --> 07:32.914
I'LL DO WHAT I CAN.

07:32.950 --> 07:34.941
WHY IS THAT
SO IMPORTANT?

07:34.980 --> 07:37.619
THERE WAS A NATIONWIDE SCARE
IN THE 19805

07:37.650 --> 07:40.187
INVOLVING SATANIC
RITUAL KILLINGS AND ABUSE.

07:40.220 --> 07:41.778
THE SATANIC PANIC,
IT WAS CALLED.

07:41.820 --> 07:44.027
IT BEGAN AFTER
THE PUBLICATION
OF A BOOK

07:44.060 --> 07:46.187
ABOUT REPRESSED MEMORIES
BEING RECOVERED

07:46.230 --> 07:47.424
TH ROUGH HYPNOTHERAPY.

07:47.460 --> 07:50.759
MEMORIES OF GROWING UP
WITH DEVIL WORSHIPPERS
WHO USE CHILDREN

07:50.800 --> 07:52.495
IN THEIR RITUALS
AND CEREMONIES.

07:52.540 --> 07:54.189
MOST OF THE CLAIMS
WERE LATER FOUND
TO BE FALSE

07:54.240 --> 07:55.389
OR JUST IMPOSSIBLE.

07:55.440 --> 07:57.965
STILL, NUMEROUS THERAPISTS
ACCEPTED THE ASSERTIONS
AS TRUE

07:58.010 --> 08:01.776
AND BEGAN SEARCHING
FOR SIMILAR SIGNS
IN THEIR OWN PATIENTS.

08:01.810 --> 08:04.176
AFI'ER ONE YEAR,
THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE REPORTED

08:04.210 --> 08:06.542
THE EXACT SAME
REPRESSED MEMORIES.

08:06.580 --> 08:07.740
THE BUREAU CONDUCTED
AN INVESTIGATION

08:07.780 --> 08:08.815
AND CONCLUDED THAT
MOST OF THE MOST OF
THE RITUAL KILLINGS

08:08.850 --> 08:12.217
OR ABUSE WERE MORE
URBAN LEGEND
THAN ANYTHING ELSE.

08:12.250 --> 08:15.811
YOU'RE SAYING THAT
THERE'S NO SUCH THING
AS DEVIL WORSHIP?

08:15.860 --> 08:17.225
NOT AT ALL.

08:17.260 --> 08:20.752
BUT MOST OF THE SATANISM
THAT WE'VE SEEN IS JUVENILES
DAMAGING PROPERTY,

08:20.800 --> 08:21.824
DESECRATING CHURCHES,
CEMETERIES.

08:21.860 --> 08:24.021
TO MY KNOWLEDGE,
THERE HAS NEVER BEEN
A PROVEN CASE

08:24.070 --> 08:27.858
OF A SATANIC
RITUAL KILLING
IN THE UNITED STATES.

08:27.900 --> 08:30.733
WELL, MAYBE
THERE IS NOW.

08:40.980 --> 08:43.710
MORNIN'.
JOHN BRIDGES.

08:43.750 --> 08:44.819
YEAH. WE SPOKE
ON THE PHONE.

08:44.850 --> 08:46.715
AGENT JAREAU,
AND THIS IS
AGENT GIDEON

08:46.760 --> 08:47.988
AND DR. REID
WITH THE FBI'S

08:48.020 --> 08:48.782
BEHAVIORAL
ANALYSIS UNIT.

08:48.820 --> 08:50.924
HI.
THANKS FOR COMING OUT
SO FAST.

08:50.960 --> 08:52.029
YEAH. OF COURSE.

08:52.060 --> 08:53.550
THERE WAS AN IN-SERVICE
IN CHARLOTI'ESVILLE LAST YEAR,

08:53.600 --> 08:55.556
SAID IF WE RAN INTO
ANY UNUSUAL HOMICIDES,

08:55.600 --> 08:58.660
WE WERE SUPPOSED TO
CALL YOU FOLKS SOONER
RATHER THAN LATER.

08:58.700 --> 08:59.894
YEAH, THEY WERE
RIGHT.

08:59.940 --> 09:01.134
IS THIS UNUSUAL ENOUGH?

09:01.170 --> 09:02.239
IT CERTAINLY IS
INTERESTING.

09:02.270 --> 09:04.932
YOU GUYS MUST
GET A LOT OF THIS, HUH

09:04.970 --> 09:06.267
NOT REALLY.

09:06.310 --> 09:07.709
WHO FOUND
THE BODIES?

09:07.740 --> 09:09.605
A HIKER FOUND
THE FIRST ONE
AT THE TRAIL,

09:09.650 --> 09:11.049
AND MY DEPUTIES
LOCATED THIS ONE

09:11.080 --> 09:11.978
WHILE SEARCHING
FOR EVIDENCE.

09:12.010 --> 09:14.046
WE DON'T EVEN KNOW
IF IT'S A MAN OR A WOMAN.

09:14.080 --> 09:14.774
IT'S A MAN.

09:14.820 --> 09:16.811
THE MALE PELVIS
IS MORE NARROW,

09:16.850 --> 09:18.181
AND THE OPENING
AT THE BOTTOM IS

09:18.220 --> 09:20.984
HEART-SHAPED,
AS OPPOSED TO OVAL.

09:21.020 --> 09:22.920
MELTED WAX?

09:22.960 --> 09:23.984
CANDLE WAX?

09:24.030 --> 09:25.782
CANDLES ARE USED
IN RITUALS.

09:25.830 --> 09:27.320
THEY'RE ALSO USED
ON BIRTHDAY CAKES.

09:27.360 --> 09:28.896
ACTUALLY, THEY WERE
ORIGINALLY USED

09:28.930 --> 09:30.966
TO PROTECT THE
BIRTH DAY CELEBRANT
FROM DEMONS

09:31.000 --> 09:31.967
FOR THE COMING YEAR.

09:32.000 --> 09:33.262
AS A MATTER OF FACT,
DOWN TO THE FOURTH
CENTURY,

09:33.300 --> 09:39.159
CHRISTIANITY REJECT ED
THE BIRTHDAY CELEBRATION
AS A PAGAN RITUAL.

09:40.240 --> 09:43.004
WHAT KIND OF DOCTOR
ARE YOU?

09:43.850 --> 09:46.068
HE WAS KIND OF
A LOCAL HERO.

09:46.110 --> 09:47.873
A HIGH SCHOOL
FOOTBALL STAR.

09:47.920 --> 09:49.114
SO A PRETTY
STRONG KID, HUH?

09:49.150 --> 09:51.789
I KNOW HE USED TO RUN
OUT HERE ON THE MOUNTAIN
ALL THE TIME.

09:51.820 --> 09:52.479
THAT'S NOT EASY.

09:52.520 --> 09:55.353
WAS HE OUT HERE
RUNNING TODAY?

09:55.390 --> 09:57.950
HE WAS WEARING SWEATS.

09:57.990 --> 09:59.127
A CRIME OF
OPPORTUNITY,

09:59.160 --> 10:00.957
OR WAS THE UNSUB
LAYING IN WAIT FOR
THIS KID SPECIFICALLY?

10:01.000 --> 10:03.992
UNSUB?
UNKNOWN SUBJECT. THE KILLER.

10:04.430 --> 10:07.331
IF IT IS A CULT,
DO YOU THINK
THEY CARED

10:07.370 --> 10:08.689
WHO THE VICTIM WAS?

10:08.740 --> 10:09.934
MAYBE. MAYBE NOT.

10:09.970 --> 10:12.939
SO WE'RE TALKING ABOUT
A BLITZ ATTACK ON A
HIGH-RISK VICTIM--

10:12.980 --> 10:14.709
ONE WHO COULD
DEFEND HIMSELF--

10:14.740 --> 10:17.004
WITH A WEAPON
PICKED UP AT THE SCENE.

10:17.050 --> 10:19.405
DISORGANIZED OFFENDER.
IT COULD BE A CULT.

10:19.450 --> 10:23.045
THE MANSON CRIME SCENES
WERE TEXTBOOK DISORGANIZED
MURDER.

10:23.090 --> 10:25.240
THIS LOOKS LIKE
A HEAVILY TRAVELED AREA.

10:25.290 --> 10:27.679
A LOT OF THE LOCALS
WALK THESE PATHS.

10:27.720 --> 10:28.652
SOME TOURISTS, TOO.

10:28.690 --> 10:31.284
IS THIS WHERE YOU'D
CONDUCT A RITUAL
KILLING?

10:31.330 --> 10:32.922
IN THE MIDDLE OF
A TRAVELED PATH?

10:32.960 --> 10:35.190
WELL, IF THE OTHER
CRIME SCENE WAS
A RITUAL SITE,

10:35.230 --> 10:36.254
WHERE THE PENTAGRAM IS,

10:36.300 --> 10:38.188
I MIGHT BLITZ
THE VICTIM HERE

10:38.230 --> 10:39.959
AND DRAG HIM TO
THE OTHER SCENE.

10:40.000 --> 10:43.231
WHY DIDN'T THEY?

10:44.140 --> 10:46.836
DOES "LOD"
MEAN ANYTHING TO YOU?

10:46.880 --> 10:50.008
UH-UH. I DON'T KNOW
OF ANY SIGNIFICANCE
IN SATANISM, EITHER.

10:50.050 --> 10:52.917
WELL, I COULD HAVE
GARCIA RESEARCH
THIS "LOD" THING,

10:52.950 --> 10:54.042
IF I COULD
GET A CALL OUT.

10:54.080 --> 10:55.968
NOT MUCH OF A CHANCE
OF THAT OUT HERE.

10:56.020 --> 10:57.112
ARE THERE ANY CULTS
IN THE AREA THAT
YOU KNOW ABOUT?

10:57.150 --> 11:01.052
SECRET GROUPS

11:01.090 --> 11:03.388
PEOPLE WHO STAY
TO THEMSELVES MOSTLY.

11:03.430 --> 11:04.988
THIS IS A VERY
RELIGIOUS AREA.

11:05.030 --> 11:08.193
CHURCH ON SUNDAYS,
FELLOWSHIP ON WEDNESDAY,

11:08.230 --> 11:09.322
BIBLE CLASSES.

11:09.360 --> 11:11.021
IF THERE WAS A SECRET GROUP,
I'D PROBABLY KNOW ABOUT IT.

11:11.070 --> 11:13.732
THAT'S AN INHERENT
CONTRADICT ION.

11:13.770 --> 11:14.691
EXCUSE ME?

11:14.740 --> 11:15.764
HE MEANS IF THERE WAS
A GROUP BEING SECRETIVE,

11:15.800 --> 11:16.732
YOU PROBABLY
WOULDN'T KNOW.

11:16.770 --> 11:20.433
LOOK, PEOPLE OUT HERE
JUST WANT A QUIET PLACE

11:20.480 --> 11:21.276
TO RAISE THEIR KIDS.

11:21.310 --> 11:24.177
WHAT I KNOW IS
NONE OF THEM ARE CAPABLE

11:24.210 --> 11:28.112
OF DOING THIS.

11:34.190 --> 11:35.214
FIND ANYTHING INTERESTING
DOWN THERE?

11:35.260 --> 11:39.924
YEAH, IT DOES LOOK LIKE
SOME KI|\SIIIDTCE)F RITUAL

11:39.960 --> 11:42.053
HAVE ANY OF YOU EVER HEARD
THE EXPRESSION "LOD"

11:42.100 --> 11:44.864
OR THE ACRONYM "L.O.D."?
NOT ME.

11:44.900 --> 11:47.368
CH ERISH

11:47.400 --> 11:48.731
SHERIFF BRIDGES!

11:48.770 --> 11:49.839
IT'S OK, HARRIS.
LET HER IN.

11:49.870 --> 11:51.758
WAS ADAM LLOYD KILLED
OUT HERE?

11:51.810 --> 11:52.538
WHO TOLD YOU THAT,
VERONICA?

11:52.570 --> 11:54.208
WAS HE? MY DAUGHTER
WAS WITH HIM.

11:54.240 --> 11:56.777
THEY WERE OUT
RUNNING TOGETHER
THIS MORNING.

11:56.810 --> 11:58.846
OH, MY GOD.
I CAN'T FIND HER.

11:58.880 --> 12:00.916
CHERISH IS MISSING.

12:00.950 --> 12:04.215
CHERISH IS MISSING!

12:04.250 --> 12:06.047
HELP ME, PLEASE.

12:14.960 --> 12:16.393
TAKE HER HOME.

12:16.430 --> 12:20.332
WE'RE LOOKING FOR SOMEONE
WHO CAN OVERPOWER
OUR VICTIM,

12:20.370 --> 12:21.962
ABDUCT A GIRL
FROM A TRAVELED PATH

12:22.000 --> 12:22.807
WITHOUT BEING SEEN.

12:22.840 --> 12:23.807
IT CERTAIN LY ITS
WITH THE CULT THEORY.

12:23.840 --> 12:27.071
MORE THAN ONE UNSUB
TO CONTROL MULTIPLE VICTIMS.

12:27.110 --> 12:29.078
BUT IF THE ATTACK WERE
FEROCIOUS ENOUGH,

12:29.110 --> 12:30.099
A SINGLE UNSUB COULD, TOO.

12:30.150 --> 12:33.039
KILL ADAM AND GRAB THE GIRL
WHILE SHE'S IN SHOCK.

12:33.080 --> 12:35.969
THIS IS SOME
ROUGH COUNTRY.

12:36.020 --> 12:37.339
WE ONLY WENT
1/4 OF A MILE,

12:37.390 --> 12:38.140
AND WE ALMOST
GOT LOST.

12:38.190 --> 12:39.111
THE UNSUB HAS TO BE
FROM THIS AREA.

12:39.150 --> 12:42.278
YOU DON'T JUST STUMBLE
ONTO A PLACE LIKE THIS.

12:42.320 --> 12:44.151
JJ, WHERE'D THE SHERIFF GO?

12:44.190 --> 12:46.329
HE'S SETTING UP
A SEARCH PARTY.

12:46.360 --> 12:49.796
TELL HIM I WANT HIM TO
USE VOLUNTEERS FROM THE AREA.

12:49.830 --> 12:50.467
LOCALS.

12:50.500 --> 12:52.297
DO YOU WANT HIM
TO KNOW WHY?

12:52.330 --> 12:53.536
NO, NOT YET.

12:53.570 --> 12:54.491
IS IT WISE
TO ALIENATE HIM?

12:54.540 --> 12:56.167
WELL, HE THINKS
WE'RE LOOKING
FOR A MONSTER.

12:56.200 --> 12:58.361
IF WE TELL HIM
WE'RE LOOKING FOR
VOLUNTEERS

12:58.410 --> 12:59.934
SO WE CAN PROFILE
WHO SHOWS UP,

12:59.980 --> 13:02.778
HE MIGHT CALL
THE WHOLE THING OFF.

13:03.080 --> 13:05.469
STATE WON'T BE HERE
FOR OVER AN HOUR.

13:05.510 --> 13:07.068
WE'RE NOT GONNA WAIT.

13:07.120 --> 13:08.246
I WANT YOU TO GATHER
EVERYONE UP,

13:08.280 --> 13:11.010
AND I'M GOING TO
ASSIGN GRID
LOCATIONS.

13:11.050 --> 13:13.109
YES, SIR.

13:14.120 --> 13:16.111
YOU HAVE A MOMENT,
SHERIFF?

13:18.190 --> 13:20.897
NOT ENOUGH MEN,
AND IN A COUPLE OF HOURS
IT'S GOING TO BE DARK.

13:20.930 --> 13:23.467
HAVE YOU CONSIDERED
USING THE PEOPLE
THAT LIVE IN THE AREA?

13:23.500 --> 13:24.569
I'M NOT GONNA
HAVE CIVILIANS

13:24.600 --> 13:25.464
MESSING UP
THE CRIME SCENE.

13:25.500 --> 13:26.364
WE CAN INSTRUCT THEM
NOT TO TOUCH ANYTHING

13:26.400 --> 13:28.595
UNTIL A MEMBER
OF LAW ENFORCEMENT ARRIVES.

13:28.640 --> 13:29.538
WHAT IF THEY
GET LOST, TOO?

13:29.570 --> 13:30.502
WE CAN HAVE THEM SIGN IN
TO A VOLUNTEER SHEET

13:30.540 --> 13:34.306
AND KEEP TRACK OF
WHAT GRID SQUARE THEY'RE IN.

13:34.340 --> 13:39.505
LOOK...I GREW UP
IN A SMALL TOWN.

13:39.550 --> 13:41.871
YOU HAVE THE STATE POLICE
COMING IN?
YEAH.

13:41.920 --> 13:45.048
YOUR LOCALS CAN
DO A BETTER JOB
OF FINDING THIS GIRL

13:45.090 --> 13:46.114
THAN ANY STATIE.

13:46.150 --> 13:48.459
YOU KNOW THAT.

13:51.030 --> 13:51.985
YOU'LL KEEP TRACK
OF 'EM?

13:52.030 --> 13:54.157
I'VE COORDINATED SEARCHES
ALL OVER THE COUNTRY.

13:54.200 --> 13:55.224
LET'S GO.

13:55.260 --> 13:58.127
HARRIS,
I'M GOING DOWNTOWN.

13:58.170 --> 14:00.434
DON'T DO ANYTHING
UNTIL I GET BACK,
ALL RIGHT?

14:00.470 --> 14:01.835
HEY, CAN I COME WITH
YOU GUYS?

14:01.870 --> 14:05.033
I NEED TO CALL QUANTICO
AND HAVE THEM RESEARCH
THAT WHOLE "LOD" THING.

14:05.070 --> 14:07.072
YEAH, SURE. HOP IN.

14:22.360 --> 14:23.281
WHAT'S HAPPENED,
JOHN?

14:23.330 --> 14:25.025
REVEREND PAUL BURKE,
THIS IS--

14:25.060 --> 14:26.584
I'M SORRY, I FORGOT
YOUR NAMES.

14:26.630 --> 14:29.121
I'M AGENT
JAREAU. THIS IS
DR. REID.

14:29.160 --> 14:30.593
THEY'RE WITH
THE FBI.
FBI?

14:30.630 --> 14:32.063
IT'S TRUE, THEN

14:32.100 --> 14:34.364
CHERISH HANSON'S
MISSING, TOO.

14:34.400 --> 14:36.061
IS THERE ANYTHING
I CAN DO?

14:36.100 --> 14:36.930
ACTUALLY, YES.

14:36.970 --> 14:37.664
WE'RE
PUTTING TOGETHER
A SEARCH PARTY.

14:37.710 --> 14:39.598
COULD YOU CALL
THE CONGREGATION?

14:39.640 --> 14:40.379
OF COURSE.

14:40.410 --> 14:42.947
OF COURSE. I'LL GO
MAKE SOME CALLS.

14:42.980 --> 14:46.245
THAN KS, REVEREND.
THIS WAY.

14:49.950 --> 14:50.780
USE ANY PHONE, DOC,

14:50.820 --> 14:51.946
YOU JUST DIAL 9
TO GET AN OUTSIDE LINE.

14:51.990 --> 14:57.121
I'VE GOT AN EMERGENCY
PHONE LIST BACK HERE
IN MY OFFICE.

15:05.600 --> 15:08.262
DID YOU PLAY BALL?

15:08.300 --> 15:09.096
NO.

15:09.140 --> 15:11.108
YEAH, I PROBABLY
WOULDN'T HAVE, EITHER,

15:11.140 --> 15:13.176
IF NOT FOR MY FATHER.
I'M CORY.

15:13.210 --> 15:14.177
SPENCER REID.

15:14.210 --> 15:15.302
WHO'S THAT, NIETZSCH E?

15:15.340 --> 15:17.444
"THUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA"
WAS RATHER ANTAGONISTIC

15:17.480 --> 15:19.698
OF THE JUDEO-CHRISTIAN WORLD
VIEW FOR THIS TOWN, ISN'T IT?

15:19.750 --> 15:23.186
I DON'T THINK TOO MANY
PEOPLE HERE WOULD'VE
BOTHERED TO READ IT.

15:23.220 --> 15:24.209
IF THEY HAD, THEY
WOULDN'T UNDERSTAND IT.

15:24.250 --> 15:27.481
MIGHT AS WELL BE
A HAWKING ESSAY
ON QUARK THEORY.

15:27.520 --> 15:31.251
NOBODY EVER GOT
THAT REFERENCE BEFORE.

15:31.690 --> 15:33.089
IS MY FATHER AROUND?

15:33.130 --> 15:33.926
THE SHERIFF?

15:33.960 --> 15:35.291
HE'S IN HIS OFFICE
WITH ANOTHER AGENT.

15:35.330 --> 15:36.228
AGENT?

15:36.260 --> 15:39.525
I'M WITH THE FBI,
BEHAVIORAL ANALYSIS UNIT.

15:39.570 --> 15:40.662
PROFILERS?

15:40.700 --> 15:44.602
HA. THIS IS MAD COOL.
I GOT, LIKE 100
QUESTIONS I GO--

15:44.640 --> 15:47.632
WAIT. WHY WOULD
FBI PROFILERS BE
HERE IN MCALLISTER?

15:47.680 --> 15:51.343
THERE WAS A MURDER OUTSIDE
OF TOWN ON THE MOUNTAIN.

15:51.380 --> 15:52.142
A MURDER?

15:52.180 --> 15:53.169
A GIRL'S MISSING.

15:53.220 --> 15:54.312
IT'S CHERISH, SON.

15:54.350 --> 15:55.146
CHERISH HANSON?

15:55.180 --> 15:56.989
WE'RE PU'ITING TOGETHER
A SEARCH PARTY.

15:57.020 --> 15:58.988
I NEED YOU TO GET THE REST
OF THE TEAM TOGETHER

15:59.020 --> 16:03.457
AND MEET US OUT AT THE TRAIL
ABOUT 1/2 MILE SOUTH
OF THE POINT.

16:03.490 --> 16:05.424
YEAH. OK.

16:06.560 --> 16:08.619
CAME AS SOON AS I HEARD,
SHERIFF.

16:08.660 --> 16:10.298
GOOD MORNING, HENRY.

16:10.330 --> 16:11.365
SIGN IN
WITH THIS LADY HERE,

16:11.400 --> 16:12.321
THEN JUST STAND BY
FOR A FEW MINUTES.

16:12.370 --> 16:15.259
EVERYONE, PLEASE, AS SOON
AS YOU'VE SIGNED IN,

16:15.300 --> 16:17.530
MAKE YOUR WAY BACK
TO THE POLICE CARS.

16:17.570 --> 16:19.538
THAT'S WHERE YOU'LL BE
ASSIGNED YOUR GROUPS.

16:19.570 --> 16:21.106
THANK YOU.

16:21.140 --> 16:22.539
I GREW UP IN BROOKLYN.

16:22.580 --> 16:24.775
YOU COULDN'T GET THIS MANY
PEOPLE OUT FOR ANYTHING
LESS THAN FREE MONEY.

16:24.810 --> 16:27.176
WELL, HERE COME
THE JOCKS
AND CHEERLEADERS.

16:27.220 --> 16:29.279
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, CAN I
HAVE YOUR A'ITENTION, PLEASE?

16:29.320 --> 16:32.289
NOW, YOU'RE ALL ASSIGNED
GRID SQUARES TO SEARCH.

16:32.320 --> 16:35.357
EACH GRID HAS A DEPUTY
OR AN FBI AGENT.

16:35.390 --> 16:38.086
YOU FIND ANYTHING,
DO NOT TOUCH IT.

16:38.130 --> 16:40.496
JUST LET YOUR
GRID LEADER KNOW.

16:40.530 --> 16:44.227
NOW, ARE THERE
ANY QUESTIONS?

16:44.270 --> 16:45.464
ALL RIGHT.

16:45.500 --> 16:48.435
EVERYONE GET
IN YOUR GROUP NOW.

16:49.370 --> 16:52.703
ALL RIGHT, YOU GUYS,
LET'S HEAD OUT.

17:04.850 --> 17:07.114
YOU HAVE
THE SIGN-IN SHEETS?

17:07.160 --> 17:08.184
YEAH.

17:08.220 --> 17:10.154
IS GARCIA STANDING BY
TO DO BACKGROUND
ON THEM ALL?

17:10.190 --> 17:12.727
I GOT A DEPUTY WAITING
TO TAKE ME BACK TO THE STATION.

17:12.760 --> 17:14.352
I'M GONNA FAX HER
SOON AS I GET THERE.

17:14.400 --> 17:17.790
GOOD. THIS TYPE OF UNSUB
CAN'T RESIST INJECTING
HIMSELF

17:17.830 --> 17:19.468
INTO A SHOW LIKE THIS.

17:19.500 --> 17:22.060
HE'S HERE WITH US.

17:22.100 --> 17:23.658
LET'S GO.

17:29.780 --> 17:32.248
MAN, THIS IS ONE
PEYTON PLACE OF A TOWN.

17:32.280 --> 17:37.411
MOST EVERYONE LIVES
WELL ABOVE THE MEDIAN
INCOME OF THE COUNTRY.

17:37.450 --> 17:39.543
YOU GOT DOCTORS, LAWYERS...

17:40.460 --> 17:45.420
ONE GUY OWNS A BUNCH OF
SHOE STORES UP AND DOWN
THE EASTERN SEABOARD.

17:45.460 --> 17:47.325
HA. IS HE MARRIED?

17:47.360 --> 17:47.951
YEAH.

17:48.000 --> 17:49.228
STORY OF MY LIFE, SUNSHINE.

17:49.260 --> 17:54.266
REVEREND PAUL BURKE,
LOOKS LIKE HE BECAME
BORN AGAIN IN PRISON.

17:54.300 --> 17:55.198
PRISON?

17:55.240 --> 17:57.629
YEAH, 2 YEARS AS A GUEST
OF THE STATE OF OHIO

17:57.670 --> 17:59.501
FOR EMBEZZLEMENT.

18:02.440 --> 18:04.544
I'M SEEING A LOT
OF TAX SHELTERING

18:04.580 --> 18:08.676
AND VARIOUS HANKY-PANKY
HERE, BUT I'M NOT SURE

18:08.720 --> 18:11.314
WHAT WOULD SUGGEST POTENTIAL
SATANIC CULT MEMBERS,

18:11.350 --> 18:13.181
SO...

18:14.390 --> 18:14.913
HOLD ON.

18:14.960 --> 18:15.756
WAIT, YOU GOT SOMETHING?

18:15.790 --> 18:18.122
YEAH, I GOT A GUY
WITH A TON OF DEBTS,

18:18.160 --> 18:21.152
SPOTTY WORK HISTORY,
HIS HOUSE IS IN FORECLOSURE.

18:21.200 --> 18:24.260
HE'S GOT A RECORD, TOO,
ASSAULT WITH A DEADLY
WEAPON 3 YEARS AGO.

18:24.300 --> 18:26.222
WAIT. DOES IT SAY
WHAT THE WEAPON WAS?

18:26.270 --> 18:26.929
BASEBALL BAT.

18:26.970 --> 18:28.665
OUR UNSUB USED
A BLUNT OBJECT.

18:28.700 --> 18:30.406
BATS ARE BLUNT, AREN'T THEY?

18:30.440 --> 18:31.566
WHAT'S THIS GUY'S NAME?

18:31.610 --> 18:33.669
DENT. HENRY DENT.

18:33.710 --> 18:35.439
OK. HERE HE IS.

18:35.480 --> 18:36.879
"GRID B-5."

18:36.910 --> 18:42.371
OK, THAT PUTS HIM
WITH...ELLE.

19:04.770 --> 19:06.237
YOU ALL RIGHT THERE?

19:06.270 --> 19:07.498
WHOA!

19:07.540 --> 19:08.939
WAY TO SCARE A GIRL.

19:08.980 --> 19:10.504
SAW YOU BENT OVER.

19:10.550 --> 19:12.575
I WAS TYING MY BOOT.

19:12.610 --> 19:15.909
THESE ALMOST NEVER
COME UNTIED.

19:15.950 --> 19:17.713
GOOD FOR YOU.

19:17.750 --> 19:18.910
MY NAM E'S HENRY.

19:18.950 --> 19:21.851
WELL, THEN GOOD FOR YOU,
HENRY.

19:21.890 --> 19:23.551
I'M ELLE.

19:23.590 --> 19:25.956
LIKE THE LE'ITER?

19:25.990 --> 19:28.390
THAT'S A DIFFERENT
KIND OF NAME.

19:28.430 --> 19:30.364
HAD IT ALL MY LIFE.

19:30.400 --> 19:33.494
THAT'S FUNNY.
YOUR WHOLE LIFE.

19:33.540 --> 19:36.794
YOU'RE WITH THE FBI,
RIGHT?

19:36.840 --> 19:39.934
THAT MUST BE EXCITING.

19:39.970 --> 19:41.278
IT HAS ITS MOMENTS.

19:41.310 --> 19:42.504
IT'S DANGEROUS, TOO,
RIGHT?

19:42.540 --> 19:45.646
I MEAN, YOU GO AI-TER
KILLERS AND THINGS.

19:45.680 --> 19:47.216
REALLY BAD GUYS.

19:47.250 --> 19:50.447
YOU EVER HAVE TO SHOOT--

20:01.560 --> 20:06.259
"SATAN COMMANDS
THE VIRGIN BE SACRIFICED
AT THE NEXT FULL MOON."

20:06.300 --> 20:08.461
THAT'S TONIGHT,
ISN'T IT?

20:10.570 --> 20:12.936
WH--WHAT'S THAT?

20:15.340 --> 20:16.830
BLOOD.

20:21.450 --> 20:22.712
TIRED?

20:22.750 --> 20:23.739
I'M FINE.

20:23.790 --> 20:25.542
WE ALL GET THEM
SOMETIMES.

20:25.590 --> 20:26.739
GET WHAT?

20:26.790 --> 20:28.451
NIGHTMARES.

20:32.290 --> 20:33.621
IT'S NOT THAT BAD.

20:33.660 --> 20:36.925
YOU WANT TO TALK ABOUT IT,
YOU KNOW WHERE I AM.

20:37.430 --> 20:39.022
UH, THEY'RE READY.

20:39.070 --> 20:40.833
GOOD.

20:42.670 --> 20:44.604
CONTRARY TO POPULAR BELIEF,

20:44.640 --> 20:47.768
THERE HAS NEVER
BEEN A PROVEN CASE
OF SATANIC RITUAL KILLING.

20:47.810 --> 20:49.801
NEVER A VERIFIED
HUMAN SACRIFICE.

20:49.840 --> 20:53.571
HAVING SAID THAT, THERE HAVE
BEEN ISOLATED CASES

20:53.620 --> 20:54.973
OF ANIMAL SACRIFICE...

20:56.720 --> 21:00.679
MANY, MANY CASES OF VANDALISM
IN THE NAME OF SATAN.

21:01.720 --> 21:05.486
BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT
RITUAL SATANISM IS IMPOSSIBLE.

21:05.530 --> 21:06.827
MORE IMPORTANTLY,
FOR OUR PURPOSES,

21:06.860 --> 21:08.657
THERE HAVE BEEN CULTS
THAT KILLED,

21:08.700 --> 21:09.758
JUST NOT IN RITUAL FASHION.

21:09.800 --> 21:12.689
THE REVEREND JIM JONES
AND THE PEOPLES TEMPLE...

21:12.730 --> 21:15.790
HIS FOLLOWERS KILLED
A U.S. CONGRESSMAN
AND 3 PEOPLE

21:15.840 --> 21:18.536
BEFORE COMMI'ITING MASS
SUICIDE AND LEAVING
OVER 900 PEOPLE DEAD.

21:18.570 --> 21:22.438
AND PERHAPS THE
MOST WIDELY-KNOWN
OF THE KILLER CULTS,

21:22.480 --> 21:25.472
THE MANSON FAMILY
UNDER THE DIRECTION
OF CHARLES MANSON,

21:25.510 --> 21:27.740
KILLED 9 PEOPLE
IN A 4-DAY PERIOD

21:27.780 --> 21:29.475
IN AN ATTEMPT TO INITIATE
A RACE WAR.

21:29.520 --> 21:31.511
KILLER CULTS
DO EXIST,

21:31.550 --> 21:32.642
AND THEY ALL HAVE
ONE THING IN COMMON...

21:32.690 --> 21:37.081
INVARIABLY THEY'RE
HEADED BY CHARISMATIC
MEGALOMANIACS.

21:37.120 --> 21:38.951
YOU'RE LOOKING
FOR THAT LEADER.

21:38.990 --> 21:41.049
HE'S WHO WILL STAND OUT.
HE'LL BE MEMORABLE

21:41.100 --> 21:43.796
TO SOMEBODY, PEOPLE WHO
AREN'T IN HIS GROUP

21:43.830 --> 21:46.469
WILL SEE HIM AS STRANGE,
WEIRD, SCARY.

21:46.500 --> 21:48.968
SINCE WE'RE DEALING
WITH PROFESSED SATANISTS,

21:49.000 --> 21:51.730
WHICH IS OI-TEN PRACT ICED
BY YOUNGER MALES,

21:51.770 --> 21:53.032
WE MAY BE LOOKING
FOR TEENAGERS.

21:53.070 --> 21:55.402
HEAW METAL MUSIC IS Ol-TEN
ASSOCIATED WITH SATANISM,

21:55.440 --> 21:58.546
AND THESE KIDS AND THEIR
LEADER MAY REFLECT THAT
IN THEIR LOOK.

21:58.580 --> 22:01.845
MOST LIKELY, THERE'LL BE
SEX, DRUGS AND ALCOHOL.

22:01.880 --> 22:03.586
AND THE LEADER,
HE'LL BE OLDER.

22:03.620 --> 22:04.609
IT'S PART OF HIS CHARM.

22:04.650 --> 22:06.709
AND HE IS FROM THIS AREA.

22:06.750 --> 22:07.853
HE'S DEFINITELY LOCAL.

22:07.890 --> 22:10.450
TH ESE WOODS ARE
TOO THICK AND CONFUSING

22:10.490 --> 22:11.787
FOR A VISITOR
TO GET AROUND IN.

22:11.830 --> 22:14.549
YOU THINK ONE
OF OUR OWN PEOPLE
IS DOING THIS?

22:14.600 --> 22:15.521
WE'RE SURE OF IT.

22:15.560 --> 22:17.425
I WOULD KNOW IF SOMEONE
WAS CAPABLE OF DOING--

22:17.470 --> 22:20.837
DAD. I KNOW
SOMEBODY LIKE THAT.

22:29.780 --> 22:31.372
HIS NAME'S MIKE ZIZZO.

22:31.410 --> 22:32.843
HE GRADUATED
ABOUT 5 YEARS AGO.

22:32.880 --> 22:38.580
HE'S IN HIS 20$,
BUT HE STILL HANGS OUT
WITH HIGH SCHOOL KIDS.

22:38.620 --> 22:41.783
HE'S GOT A GROUP OF THEM.
THEY FOLLOW HIM EVERYWHERE.

22:41.820 --> 22:44.653
THEY ALL GET HIGH
AND LISTEN TO HEAW METAL.

22:44.690 --> 22:47.796
HE CALLS THEM THE LORDS
OF DESTRUCTION.

22:47.830 --> 22:48.797
LOD.

22:48.830 --> 22:51.628
HOW DO YOU KNOW THIS,
CORY?

22:52.900 --> 22:54.993
IT'S ALL RIGHT, SON.

22:55.500 --> 22:56.728
I'VE BEEN THERE,

22:56.770 --> 22:58.408
WHERE THEY HANG OUT
DRINKING BEERS.

22:58.440 --> 23:00.772
HE TALKS ABOUT SATAN
ALL THE TIME.

23:00.810 --> 23:03.643
SAYS HE'S
THE ONE TRUE GOD.

23:04.550 --> 23:05.278
WHERE IS THIS PLACE?

23:05.310 --> 23:06.641
ON THE OTHER SIDE
OF THE MOUNTAIN.

23:06.680 --> 23:07.271
THE OLD JENSON HOUSE.

23:07.310 --> 23:09.676
IT'S OUT OF MY JURISDICTION.

23:09.720 --> 23:11.085
NOT OURS.

23:13.860 --> 23:15.851
SORRY, DAD.

23:34.840 --> 23:37.445
I'M NOT GOING
ON THE RAID.

23:37.480 --> 23:38.742
WHAT'S UP?

23:38.780 --> 23:40.919
I DON'T KNOW YET.

24:27.530 --> 24:28.792
FBI!

24:28.830 --> 24:30.127
DON'T MOVE!

24:30.160 --> 24:31.593
FBI! FREEZE!

24:31.630 --> 24:32.267
WHERE'S ZIZZO?!

24:32.300 --> 24:33.665
BACK UP
AGAINST THE WALL!

24:33.700 --> 24:34.689
WHERE'S ZIZZO?

24:34.740 --> 24:36.093
WHERE IS HE?

24:36.140 --> 24:37.061
WHERE'S ZIZZO?!

24:37.100 --> 24:39.864
GET AWAY!
AGAINST THE WALL.

24:40.270 --> 24:42.500
WE GOT HIM!

25:03.000 --> 25:05.025
DO YOU BELIEVE IN GOD?

25:05.070 --> 25:07.061
EXCUSE ME?

25:08.100 --> 25:10.830
DO YOU BELIEVE IN GOD?

25:11.610 --> 25:13.009
YES.

25:14.310 --> 25:16.574
HOW ABOUT THE DEVIL?

25:16.610 --> 25:18.942
IS SOMEONE GOING TO
TELL ME WHY I'M HERE

25:18.980 --> 25:20.971
OR ARE WE JUST GOING
TO PLAY STARING GAMES

25:21.020 --> 25:22.078
ALL NIGHT?

25:22.120 --> 25:22.848
THIS WAS FOUND

25:22.880 --> 25:24.711
WHERE CHERISH HANSON
WENT MISSING.

25:24.750 --> 25:26.843
NO WONDER EVERYONE'S
ALL FREAKED OUT.

25:26.890 --> 25:30.826
MCALLISTER'S PERFECT
DEBUTANTE IS IN TROUBLE.

25:30.860 --> 25:32.919
READ THE NOTE.

25:35.800 --> 25:36.619
YOU THINK SOMEONE

25:36.660 --> 25:37.866
THREATENING TO KILL
THIS GIRL IS FUNNY?

25:37.900 --> 25:45.261
NO, I THINK SOMEONE
CALLING CHERISH HANSON
A VIRGIN IS FUNNY.

25:45.310 --> 25:47.801
YOU'RE A SATANIST,
MIKE?

25:47.840 --> 25:48.670
SURE.

25:48.710 --> 25:49.779
AND YOU WORSHIP THE DEVIL?

25:49.810 --> 25:51.801
YOU KNOW WHAT
SATANISM IS?

25:51.850 --> 25:52.669
EDUCATE US.

25:52.710 --> 25:56.214
THE WORD SATAN COMES
FROM ANCIENT HEBREW.

25:56.250 --> 25:57.217
IT JUST MEANS OPPOSER.

25:57.250 --> 26:01.949
SATAN OPPOSES THE HYPOCRITICAL
MORALS AND DOGMAS

26:01.990 --> 26:03.981
OF THE SO-CALLED HOLY CHURCH
AND ITS FOLLOWERS.

26:04.030 --> 26:07.898
IF YOU GREW UP
IN THIS TOWN WITH GOD
SHOVED DOWN YOUR THROAT

26:07.930 --> 26:10.057
EVERY DAY, YOU'D
OPPOSE IT, TOO.

26:10.100 --> 26:12.022
IT'S ALL HYPOCRISY.

26:12.070 --> 26:14.197
DO THIS.
DON'T DO THAT.

26:14.240 --> 26:14.990
AND ALL THE TIME,

26:15.040 --> 26:18.362
THE ADULTS ARE THE ONES
SCREWING UP.

26:18.410 --> 26:21.607
SO BASICALLY
WE'RE JUST ATHEISTS.

26:21.640 --> 26:24.871
AGGRESSIVELY ATHEIST.

26:29.350 --> 26:31.318
HOW AGGRESSIVE, MIKE?

26:33.020 --> 26:37.218
YOU'RE ONE OF THE FBI
AGENTS, AREN'T YOU?

26:41.000 --> 26:43.696
IS THERE SOMETHING
YOU WANT TO TELL ME?

26:43.730 --> 26:48.099
DO YOU THINK
GOD IS VENGEFUL?

26:48.970 --> 26:50.062
I DON'T KNOW.

26:50.100 --> 26:52.739
YOU DON'T THINK
HE PUNISHES US?

26:52.770 --> 26:57.378
AI-TER HURRICANE KATRINA,
I READ SOME ESSAYS BY
RELIGIOUS SCHOLARS.

26:57.410 --> 27:02.973
ONE WRITER SAID GOD
WAS PUNISHING AMERICA
FOR ITS IMMORALITY.

27:03.020 --> 27:07.684
NEW ORLEANS WAS A WICKED CITY,
LIKE SODOM AND GOMORRAH.

27:07.720 --> 27:11.258
ANOTHER ONE, A PRIEST
FROM NEW ORLEANS,

27:11.290 --> 27:15.021
HE THOUGHT THE HURRICANE
WAS PROOF OF GOD'S LOVE.

27:15.060 --> 27:18.928
THOSE LEVEES DIDN'T BREAK
UNTIL AFTER THE STORM
WAS OVER.

27:18.970 --> 27:23.293
IF THEY'D BROKEN SOONER,
THOUSANDS WOULD'VE DIED.

27:23.340 --> 27:26.730
SO...

27:26.770 --> 27:28.977
I GUESS THE ANSWER
TO YOUR QUESTION DEPENDS

27:29.010 --> 27:32.878
ON WHETHER OR NOT YOU FEEL
YOU HAVE SOMETHING TO BE
PUNISHED FOR.

27:35.820 --> 27:38.948
MY FRIEND CHERISH...

27:39.150 --> 27:40.754
SHE'S MISSING.

27:40.790 --> 27:43.782
AND IT'S MY FAULT.

27:44.330 --> 27:45.683
I'VE GOT TO GIVE
THE SHERIFF A REPORT.

27:45.730 --> 27:47.186
I'LL BE BACK
AS SOON AS I CAN.

27:47.230 --> 27:48.458
YOU GUYS NEED ANYTHING?

27:48.500 --> 27:49.296
COFFEE WOULD BE NICE.

27:49.330 --> 27:52.026
HE TAKES ABOUT
A QUART OF SUGAR IN IT.

27:52.070 --> 27:53.298
2 TEASPOONS IS FINE.

27:53.330 --> 27:54.831
YOU GOT IT.

27:54.870 --> 27:56.064
MORGAN.

27:56.100 --> 27:58.136
YOU KNEW I DIDN'T WANT
YOU TO TELL HOTCH
ABOUT MY NIGHTMARES.

27:58.170 --> 28:00.058
REID, THAT'S SOMETHING
THEY NEED TO KNOW ABOUT.

28:00.110 --> 28:01.702
WHAT DO YOU MEAN
"TH EY"?

28:01.740 --> 28:02.434
HOTCH AND GIDEON.

28:02.480 --> 28:04.107
YOU TOLD GIDEON, TOO?

28:04.150 --> 28:05.447
YEAH, AND IT'S OK, KID.

28:05.480 --> 28:07.368
WHAT IF THEY THINK
I CAN'T DO MY JOB?

28:07.410 --> 28:09.344
WHAT IF THEY WANT TO
PULL ME OFF THE TEAM?

28:09.380 --> 28:10.074
THEY WON'T.

28:10.120 --> 28:13.112
OH, YEAH

28:13.150 --> 28:14.287
I JUST DO.

28:14.320 --> 28:15.981
YOU HAD NO RIGHT, MAN.

28:16.020 --> 28:17.180
I--I CONFIDED IN YOU.

28:20.190 --> 28:21.191
IT GETS THROWN BACK
IN MY FACE.

28:21.230 --> 28:25.098
MINE STARTED 6 MONTHS
AFTER I GOT INTO THE B.A.U.

28:26.170 --> 28:27.194
YEAH.

28:27.230 --> 28:29.698
MINE.

28:34.380 --> 28:38.009
WE WERE WORKING
A STRANGLER CASE IN MONTANA.

28:38.050 --> 28:38.869
FOUR VICTIMS.

28:38.910 --> 28:41.117
ME, I WAS STILL PRETTY
YOUNG AT THE TIME,

28:41.150 --> 28:43.118
SO YOU KNOW, I WAS
FEELING MYSELF.

28:43.150 --> 28:44.287
I WAS COCKY,
I WAS ARROGANT.

28:44.320 --> 28:46.083
THE LOCALS, THEY DIDN'T
HAVE ANYTHING, SO I
STEPPED UP.

28:46.120 --> 28:48.156
I SAID I CAN NAIL DOWN
A PROFILE FOR YOU

28:48.190 --> 28:50.283
JUST AS SOON AS I CAN
GET WHAT I NEED.

28:50.320 --> 28:52.049
MORE VICTIMS?

28:52.090 --> 28:52.727
MM-HMM.

28:52.760 --> 28:54.455
SHE WAS FOUND
THE NEXT DAY.

28:54.500 --> 28:57.196
SO I WENT DOWN TO THE SCENE
TO DO MY THING.

28:57.230 --> 28:59.266
AND AS I WAS LOOKING
OVER THE BODY,

28:59.300 --> 29:01.234
THAT'S WHEN I SAW THEM.

29:01.270 --> 29:03.135
HER EYES, REID.

29:03.170 --> 29:05.161
THEY WERE WIDE OPEN.

29:05.210 --> 29:07.508
AND THERE WAS SOMETHING
DIFFERENT ABOUT THEM,

29:07.540 --> 29:11.146
IT WAS LIKE THEY WERE
LOOKING RIGHT AT ME.

29:11.180 --> 29:12.306
LIKE SHE KNEW.

29:12.350 --> 29:15.217
I ASKED FOR A VICTIM.

29:15.250 --> 29:17.115
WELL, HERE SHE WAS.

29:17.150 --> 29:19.084
THAT'S WHEN THEY
STARTED FOR ME.

29:19.120 --> 29:21.816
NIGHT Al-TER NIGHT
I WOULD FALL ASLEEP
AND I WOULD SEE THOSE EYES.

29:21.860 --> 29:23.157
THEY WERE DEAD EYES.

29:23.190 --> 29:24.122
ACCUSING EYES.

29:24.160 --> 29:26.151
AND IT GOT TO THE POINT
WHERE IT WAS HAPPENING

29:26.190 --> 29:27.054
EVEN WHEN I WASN'T ASLEEP.

29:27.090 --> 29:29.058
REID, EVERYWHERE I WENT,
I SAW THOSE EYES.

29:29.100 --> 29:31.193
WHAT DID YOU DO?

29:31.230 --> 29:32.128
GIDEON.

29:32.170 --> 29:34.138
HE KNEW.
I DIDN'T TELL HIM.
I WAS LIKE YOU.

29:34.170 --> 29:36.434
I DIDN'T WANT
ANYBODY TO KNOW.

29:36.470 --> 29:38.199
HE JUST...HE KNEW.

29:38.240 --> 29:42.904
AND HE SAT ME DOWN
AND HE JUST KIND OF
TALKED ME THROUGH IT.

29:42.940 --> 29:46.148
I STILL HAVE THE NIGHTMARES
TO THIS DAY,

29:46.180 --> 29:48.978
JUST NOT NEARLY AS OI-TEN.

29:49.180 --> 29:50.818
BUT WHEN THEY COME BACK,

29:50.850 --> 29:54.115
I KNOW HOW TO HANDLE
THEM BE'ITER.

29:54.160 --> 29:56.082
WHAT DID HE SAY?

30:03.160 --> 30:04.468
DID YOU FIND HER?

30:04.500 --> 30:05.865
NO.

30:05.900 --> 30:07.197
DID ZIZZO SAY
ANYTHING?

30:07.230 --> 30:10.199
WE DON'T KNOW.
WE'VE BEEN HERE
THE WHOLE TIME.

30:10.240 --> 30:10.934
CORY, CALM DOWN.

30:10.970 --> 30:12.198
HOW AM I SUPPOSED
TO CALM DOWN?

30:12.240 --> 30:13.969
CHERISH IS MISSING.

30:14.010 --> 30:15.238
DID YOU CHECK ALL OVER?

30:15.280 --> 30:16.577
WE SEARCHED
THE WHOLE HOUSE.

30:16.610 --> 30:18.100
WHAT ABOUT
THE OUTBUILDING?

30:18.150 --> 30:18.809
OUTBUILDING?

30:18.850 --> 30:20.101
DID YOU CHECK
THE OTHER AREA?

30:20.150 --> 30:20.946
BACK IN THE WOODS?

30:20.980 --> 30:21.947
I DIDN'T KNOW THERE
WAS ANOTHER AREA.

30:21.980 --> 30:24.016
YEAH, IT'S LIKE A SLUICE
STRUCTURE OR SOMETHING.

30:24.050 --> 30:26.211
HE TOOK ME THERE ONCE.
IT'S THIS WAY.

30:30.320 --> 30:32.185
LET'S GO.

30:34.960 --> 30:39.465
THE SKELETON UNDER THE TREE,
HE DIED A YEAR AGO.

30:39.500 --> 30:41.991
HE FELL OFF THE TRAIL,
CRACKED HIS HEAD OPEN.

30:42.040 --> 30:44.565
HE WAS JUST SOME TOURIST
OR SOMETHING.

30:44.610 --> 30:45.406
HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT?

30:45.440 --> 30:48.102
WE WENT TO SEE THE BODY
ALL THE TIME.

30:48.140 --> 30:50.529
WE WATCHED IT DECOMPOSE.

30:50.580 --> 30:51.308
WHO DID?

30:51.350 --> 30:56.344
WE DID. EVERYBODY,
THE WHOLE GROUP.

30:58.920 --> 31:00.182
WHAT THE HELL IS THIS?

31:00.220 --> 31:02.950
WHY DON'T YOU
TELL US, MIKE?

31:05.490 --> 31:07.355
I'VE NEVER SEEN THIS BEFORE.

31:07.390 --> 31:11.929
PENTAG RAM, BODY,
CANDLES, L.O.D.

31:11.970 --> 31:13.096
LORDS OF
DESTRUCTION.

31:13.130 --> 31:14.199
I'VE NEVER SEEN THIS.

31:14.240 --> 31:18.404
FROM WHERE I STAND, MIKE,
IT LOOKS LIKE YOU SIGNED IT.

31:18.440 --> 31:21.329
AT FIRST WE WERE
JUST CURIOUS, YOU KNOW?

31:21.380 --> 31:24.144
WE WOULD GO,
A COUPLE OF US
AT A TIME,

31:24.180 --> 31:25.078
SHOW EACH OTHER.

31:25.110 --> 31:27.442
NONE OF US HAD EVER SEEN
A DEAD BODY BEFORE.

31:27.480 --> 31:30.278
AND THEN IT KIND OF
BECAME OUR THING.

31:30.320 --> 31:34.689
SOMETHING THAT WE
HAD THAT OUR PARENTS
DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT.

31:34.720 --> 31:38.383
IT WAS OURS.

31:45.470 --> 31:47.222
THIS WAS A HUMAN BEING.

31:47.270 --> 31:52.628
I TOLD YOU THAT
WE'RE BEING PUNISHED.

31:55.210 --> 32:00.409
IT'S UP HERE.
THIS IS OUR
SECRET PLACE.

32:15.000 --> 32:16.399
REID?

32:30.440 --> 32:31.702
I CAN'T BELIEVE
THIS IS HAPPENING.

32:31.750 --> 32:35.379
THIS KIND OF THING
DOESN'T HAPPEN
IN MCALLISTER.

32:35.420 --> 32:36.512
YOU SAID YOU READ
THE PROFILING BOOKS.

32:36.550 --> 32:42.318
YOU KNOW BAD THINGS HAPPEN
ANYWHERE. ANWVHERE AT ANYTIME.

33:30.400 --> 33:34.336
SHE IN THERE

33:34.380 --> 33:36.735
CORY, SHE'S IN THERE.

33:37.380 --> 33:39.075
IS SHE DEAD?

33:41.820 --> 33:43.412
SHE CAN'T BE DEAD.

33:43.450 --> 33:45.543
C'MON. C'MON.

33:48.620 --> 33:51.327
LOOK, WE DREW OUR STARS
UPSIDE-DOWN,

33:51.360 --> 33:54.090
GET DRUNK, AND LISTEN TO METAL.
THAT'S IT.

33:54.130 --> 33:56.428
HEY, WE DON'T KILL PEOPLE.

33:56.460 --> 33:58.690
THIS IS YOUR CHANCE TO
MAKE THIS RIGHT, ZIZZO.

33:58.730 --> 34:00.425
YOU DON'T WANT
TO MAKE IT RIGHT.

34:00.470 --> 34:02.791
YOU WANNA BLAME SOMEONE
WHO DOESN'T CONFORM

34:02.840 --> 34:07.129
TO YOUR VIEW OF HOW PEOPLE
SHOULD ACT AND THINK.

34:07.940 --> 34:10.738
I NEED TO TALK TO YOU,
ALL OF YOU.

34:12.680 --> 34:16.776
REID, I WANT YOU
TO GO TO THE HOUSE

34:16.820 --> 34:18.685
AND SEE IF THE DEPUTIES
HAVE COME BACK.

34:18.720 --> 34:19.744
WHAT?

34:19.790 --> 34:21.678
WE NEED THE SHERIFF
AND THE CRHI'E/IIEESCENE TEAM

34:21.720 --> 34:22.652
BUT--

34:22.690 --> 34:25.124
REID. DO IT.

34:30.830 --> 34:36.769
I CAN'T--
I CAN'T BELIEVE CHERISH

34:39.640 --> 34:40.538
I'M SORRY
ABOUT YOUR FRIEND.

34:40.570 --> 34:45.678
I SAW HER THE OTHER DAY.
IT WAS A PEP RALLY.

34:50.780 --> 34:54.113
I'VE BEEN WITH
BRANDY DREIFORT.
DO YOU KNOW HER?

34:54.160 --> 34:55.479
SHE'S A FRIEND
OF MY SON'S.

34:55.520 --> 34:57.659
SHE'S A FRIEND
OF CHERISH'S, TOO.

34:57.690 --> 34:58.520
AND?

34:58.560 --> 35:00.380
WELL, THEY ALL KNEW
ABOUT THE SKELETON.

35:00.430 --> 35:01.249
WHO DID?

35:01.300 --> 35:02.050
FOOTBALL TEAM,
CH EERLEADERS,
EVERYON E.

35:02.100 --> 35:04.489
THEY ALL WATCHED
THIS MAN DECOMPOSE,

35:04.530 --> 35:08.159
LIKE IT WAS A GAME
FOR THEIR AMUSEMENT.

35:08.200 --> 35:08.734
WHAT?

35:08.770 --> 35:09.839
AS FAR AS I
CAN TELL,

35:09.870 --> 35:10.837
THE ONLY KIDS
IN THAT AREA

35:10.870 --> 35:14.408
WHO DIDN'T KNOW
WERE MIKE ZIZZO
AND THE L.O.D.

35:14.440 --> 35:15.202
IT'S RIDICULOUS.

35:15.240 --> 35:17.276
SOUNDS IMPOSSIBLE,
IT'S UNBELIEVABLE.

35:17.310 --> 35:18.038
SHE TOLD ME
ALL ABOUT IT.

35:18.080 --> 35:20.173
THE GUY WAS A HIKER
OR SOMETHING.

35:20.210 --> 35:23.270
PROBABLY HAVE HIM LISTED,
MISSING PERSON SOMEWHERE.

35:23.320 --> 35:25.447
HOW DO YOU KNOW THE L.O.D.
WASN'T INVOLVED?

35:25.490 --> 35:27.378
WELL, SHE SAID THE PENTAGRAM
AND THE CANDLES,

35:27.420 --> 35:30.548
THEY WEREN'T THERE
A FEW MONTHS AGO.

35:30.590 --> 35:31.659
WHICH MEANS?

35:31.690 --> 35:36.150
SOMEONE WANTED US TO BELIEVE
THERE WERE SATANISTS HERE.

35:40.270 --> 35:42.534
REID TELLS ME YOU'VE READ
ALL THE PROFILING BOOKS.

35:42.570 --> 35:47.200
ACTUALLY KINDA HOPING TO BE
ONE OF YOU GUYS SOMEDAY.

35:47.240 --> 35:52.303
ARE YA

35:52.350 --> 35:55.410
THE UNSUB LIKES TO
INJECT HIMSELF INTO
THE INVESTIGATION.

35:55.450 --> 35:57.372
THAT'S WHAT THIS TYPE
OF KILLER DOES.

35:57.420 --> 36:00.639
WHO GAVE US IS ZIZZO

36:00.690 --> 36:02.578
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT CORY?

36:02.620 --> 36:03.712
IT WAS CONVENIENT,
WASN'T IT?

36:03.760 --> 36:05.421
LUCKY WE HAD A KID
RIGHT IN THE ROOM

36:05.460 --> 36:07.325
WHO COULD TELL US
WHERE THE L.O.D. WAS.

36:07.360 --> 36:11.592
A GROUP OF FRINGE
KIDS NOBODY IN
THE TOWN WOULD LIKE.

36:11.630 --> 36:12.324
BUT

36:12.370 --> 36:13.268
YOU CALLED US HERE
TO ADVISE YOU.

36:13.300 --> 36:15.359
MY ADVICE WOULD BE
TO GET IN FRONT
OF THIS

36:15.400 --> 36:18.563
BEFORE YOUR SON HURTS
HIMSELF OR ANYBODY ELSE.

36:18.610 --> 36:21.477
YOU KNOW WHERE HE IS,
SHERIFF?

36:21.510 --> 36:23.535
HE WENT UP
TO THE JENSON HOUSE

36:23.580 --> 36:25.775
TO SEE IF YOUR GUYS
FOUND ANYTHING ON CHERISH.

36:25.810 --> 36:27.573
MORGAN AND REID ARE
OUT THERE RIGHT NOW.

36:27.610 --> 36:31.444
HEY, SHERIFF. DID YOU
OPEN THE GUN LOCKER?

36:31.490 --> 36:32.309
NO.

36:32.350 --> 36:35.478
SOMEONE DID.
THERE'S A REVOLVER MISSING.

36:39.430 --> 36:40.488
YOU KNOW THAT WE LOOK
AT A CRIME SCENE

36:40.530 --> 36:42.521
FROM A DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE
THAN REGULAR COPS, RIGHT?

36:42.560 --> 36:44.323
WE LOOK FOR MORE THAN
JUST THE EVIDENCE.

36:44.370 --> 36:45.962
WE TRY TO PICK UP ON
THE BEHAVIOR OF THE KILLER.

36:46.000 --> 36:48.298
FOR EXAMPLE, THE GUY WE'RE
LOOKING FOR IN THIS CRIME

36:48.340 --> 36:50.865
WOULD BE CLASSIFIED
AS A DISORGANIZED KILLER.

36:50.900 --> 36:53.300
SOUNDS LIKE ZIZZO,
DOESN'T IT?

36:53.340 --> 36:55.900
YEAH. SURE IT DOES.
BUT THEN AGAIN,

36:55.940 --> 36:59.239
SOMETIMES A DISORGANIZED KILLER
ONLY LOOKS DISORGANIZED.

36:59.280 --> 37:02.716
SOMETIMES IT'S
ACTUALLY AN ORGANIZED GUY,
AND PRETTY SMART GUY.

37:02.750 --> 37:06.618
SOMEBODY WHO CAN MANIPULATE
A CRIME SCENE TO MAKE IT LOOK
LIKE SOMEBODY ELSE DID IT.

37:06.650 --> 37:08.618
BECAUSE OF THAT, WE ALSO
GO'ITA LOOK FOR SOMEONE

37:08.660 --> 37:11.754
WHO MIGHT TRY TO
PUT HIMSELF RIGHT IN THE
MIDDLE OF AN INVESTIGATION

37:11.790 --> 37:14.691
SO THAT HE
CAN INFLUENCE THINGS.

37:18.300 --> 37:23.431
ESPECIALLY IF HE
KNOWS EXACTLY WHAT IT IS
THAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR.

37:26.840 --> 37:28.728
I MEAN, HE WANTS
TO CONTROL THIS, RIGHT?

37:28.780 --> 37:33.979
HMM? AND THAT WOULD
EXTEND TO DISCOVERY.

37:34.010 --> 37:41.485
WANTIN' THE BODY FOUND
WHEN AND ESPECIALLY WHERE
HE WANTS THAT BODY FOUND.

37:44.430 --> 37:45.419
YOU MEAN ME?

37:45.460 --> 37:48.554
THIS WAS MORE THAN JUST
A LUCKY GUESS, WASN'T IT?

37:48.600 --> 37:49.498
I KNEW ABOUT THE BUILDING.

37:49.530 --> 37:51.896
YOU ALSO KNEW ABOUT ZIZZO
AND THE SATANISM.

37:51.930 --> 37:53.067
I WAS ONLY
TRYING TO HELP.

37:53.100 --> 37:54.021
WELL, YOU DID THAT.

37:54.070 --> 37:56.561
WE COULDN'T HAVE FOUND
THIS PLACE WITHOUT YOU.

37:56.600 --> 37:58.761
NO ONE'S UP THERE.

37:58.810 --> 38:01.734
REID. REID.

38:01.780 --> 38:02.576
CORY.

38:02.610 --> 38:03.770
THIS GOT
ALL MESSED UP.

38:03.810 --> 38:04.572
DON'T BE STUPID.

38:04.610 --> 38:05.577
SHE WASN'T SUPPOSED
TO BE WITH HIM.

38:05.610 --> 38:09.068
IT WAS HIS RUN.
HE RUNS IT EVERY
DAY, NOT HER.

38:09.120 --> 38:11.076
CORY, LISTEN TO ME.
WE CAN FIX THIS.

38:11.120 --> 38:12.041
BUT YOU'VE GOT
TO LET REID GO.

38:12.090 --> 38:14.752
I NEVER MEANT TO HURT HER.
BUT MAKE NO MISTAKE,

38:14.790 --> 38:16.781
I WILL SHOOT YOUR BOY
RIGHT NOW.

38:16.820 --> 38:17.684
NO, YOU WON'T.

38:18.760 --> 38:20.785
TEMPT NOT
A DESPERATE MAN.

38:20.830 --> 38:21.751
PUT THE GUN DOWN.

38:21.800 --> 38:22.994
ALL RIGHT. YOU WIN.

38:23.030 --> 38:25.464
DROP IT.
DROP THE GUN.

38:25.500 --> 38:31.837
OK. OK. YOU WIN.
I'M PU'ITING THE GUN DOWN.

38:33.770 --> 38:36.739
YOU'RE IN CONTROL, CORY.
LET HIM GO.

38:36.780 --> 38:38.509
FOR THE EVIL
IS MAN'S BEST FORCE.

38:38.550 --> 38:40.541
MAN MUST BECOME
BE'ITER AND EVILER.

38:40.580 --> 38:41.911
THAT'S WHAT THIS
IS ABOUT, RIGHT?

38:41.950 --> 38:43.542
ZARATHUSTRA

38:43.580 --> 38:46.617
THERE'S NO MORAL OBLIGATION
FOR KILLING SOMEONE

38:46.650 --> 38:48.015
IF YOU'RE SUPERIOR TO THEM?

38:48.050 --> 38:50.757
BUT NIETZSCHE
WAS SPEAKING METAPHORICALLY
ABOUT EVOLVING AS A SPECIES.

38:50.790 --> 38:54.556
YOU'RE JUST A HORNY KID
WHO WANTED TO GET RID OF
THE CHEERLEADER'S BOYFRIEND.

38:54.600 --> 38:55.157
NO.
YES.

38:55.200 --> 38:56.792
THAT WAS NEVER
MY INTENT-

38:56.830 --> 38:57.797
C'MON.

39:07.110 --> 39:08.134
YOU ALL RIGHT?

39:08.170 --> 39:09.330
WHAT HAPPENED?

39:09.380 --> 39:11.678
HIM BRINGING US DOWN HERE WAS
WAY TOO MUCH OF A COINCIDENCE.

39:11.710 --> 39:12.699
I GOT THAT.

39:12.750 --> 39:14.775
BUT DID YOU HAVE
TO TACKLE US BOTH?

39:14.820 --> 39:17.072
YOU'RE WELCOME, REID.

39:18.990 --> 39:22.756
C'MON. LET'S GO, CORY.

39:29.500 --> 39:31.468
PLAYWRIGHT
EUGENE IONESCO SAID,

39:31.500 --> 39:37.791
"IDEOLOGIES SEPARATE US,
DREAMS AND ANGUISH
BRING US TOGETHER."

40:05.470 --> 40:06.960
REID.

40:09.140 --> 40:11.859
DEBORAH LOUISE ADDISON.
HER HUSBAND TIM.

40:11.910 --> 40:14.435
THE KIDS
ARE AMBER AND KEITH.
EIGHT AND SIX.

40:14.480 --> 40:17.631
IN 1985, DEBORAH LOUISE
WAS WALKING HOME
FROM SCHOOL.

40:17.680 --> 40:21.138
SHE WAS ABDUCT ED.
SHE WAS 13.

40:21.180 --> 40:22.215
WE PROFILED THE UNSUB.

40:22.250 --> 40:25.879
AND WE WERE ABLE TO LOCATE
HER BEFORE HE HARMED HER.

40:25.920 --> 40:30.084
SHE WRITES A LETTER TO
THE B.A.U. EVERY YEAR.

40:30.120 --> 40:33.829
SHE UPDATES US
ON HER LIFE.

40:33.860 --> 40:35.521
IT'S NICE, BUT--

40:35.560 --> 40:41.863
WE ALL HAVE BAD DREAMS.
EVERYONE ON THE PLANE.

40:41.900 --> 40:45.563
WHO WOULDN'T? WE HUNT
THE WORST OF HUMANITY,

40:45.610 --> 40:51.674
WE SEE THE DEPTHS
OF DEPRAVITY,
WE DREAM OF MONSTERS.

40:51.710 --> 40:57.239
IN MY DREAM THERE'S A BABY
IN THE MIDDLE OF A CIRCLE

40:57.280 --> 41:00.738
AND THERE'S SOMEONE
ON THE OTHER SIDE.

41:00.790 --> 41:04.783
AND I CAN'T GET
TO HER BEFORE--

41:06.730 --> 41:07.924
EVERY NIGHT
I LOOK AT DEBORAH,

41:07.960 --> 41:13.091
HELPS ME TO GO TO SLEEP
THINKING OF THE
VICTIMS WE'VE SAVED.

41:13.130 --> 41:16.839
WE DON'T ALWAYS BEAT THE
MONSTERS TO THE BABIES,

41:16.870 --> 41:20.761
BUT WE DO ENOUGH TO MAKE
THE JOB WORTH IT,

41:20.810 --> 41:24.473
KEEP THE NIGHTMARES
BEARABLE.
