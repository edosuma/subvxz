WEBVTT

00:08.079 --> 00:09.510
WHERE'S SIMON?

00:09.510 --> 00:11.482
(grunts)

00:11.482 --> 00:14.115
GOOD. THEY FOUND YOU.

00:14.115 --> 00:17.418
I'M DOING MY BEST
TO GET YOU REINSTATED.
WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO
TILL THEN?

00:17.418 --> 00:21.052
YOU SAID YOU SAW MORE CLUES
FROM YOUR VISION. WORK THEM.

00:21.052 --> 00:23.094
(Nicole) I SAW SOMEONE
DROWNING ME IN MY FLASH-FORWARD.

00:23.094 --> 00:25.626
I FELT LIKE I DESERVED
WHAT WAS HAPPENING,

00:25.626 --> 00:27.198
LIKE I HAD DONE
SOMETHING WRONG.

00:27.198 --> 00:29.760
THE GUY WHO LEADS IT SEES
THINGS IN A REALLY POSITIVE WAY.

00:29.760 --> 00:31.662
YOU SHOULD CHECK IT OUT.
HE MIGHT BE ABLE TO HELP.

00:31.662 --> 00:35.136
YOU MAY CALL ME FLOSSO.
(grunts)

00:35.136 --> 00:37.108
AND I'M A VILLAIN.

00:37.108 --> 00:38.069
DEM, COME HERE.
YOU HAVE TO SEE THIS.

00:38.069 --> 00:39.640
SO AS FAR AS WE KNOW,

00:39.640 --> 00:41.642
EVERY SINGLE PERSON
ON THE ENTIRE PLANET

00:41.642 --> 00:45.045
LOST CONSCIOUSNESS AT THE EXACT
SAME PERIOD OF TIME, RIGHT?

00:45.045 --> 00:48.048
THIS WAS IN DETROIT.
RIGHT THERE. LOOK RIGHT THERE.

00:48.048 --> 00:52.052
WHO THE HELL IS THAT?
AND WHY ARE THEY AWAKE?
(beep)

00:54.054 --> 00:57.188
YOU HAVE TO AT LEAST LET ME
PAY FOR YOUR COFFEE.

00:57.188 --> 00:58.659
IT'S OKAY.
(door bells jingle)

00:58.659 --> 01:01.832
UH, I DIDN'T
HAVE ANY PLANS ANYWAY.

01:04.095 --> 01:06.097
I MEAN, IT'S NOT LIKE
HE'S SCARY OR ANYTHING.

01:06.097 --> 01:08.769
I-I JUST FEEL BETTER
IF YOU'RE HERE.
I'LL BE RIGHT HERE
IF YOU NEED ME.

01:08.769 --> 01:10.341
GREAT.

01:10.341 --> 01:13.344
OH, AND CAN YOU SEE IF YOU CAN
GET THE CHANGE IN PENNIES?

01:20.551 --> 01:23.114
CAN I BUY YOU
A CUP OF COFFEE?

01:23.114 --> 01:26.717
UH, THAT'S ALL RIGHT.
I'M GETTING ONE TO GO.

01:26.717 --> 01:31.122
WHY DON'T YOU TELL ME
WHAT UPSET YOU EARLIER?

01:34.565 --> 01:38.869
IN MY FLASH-FORWARD,
I WAS UNDERWATER.

01:38.869 --> 01:41.372
(whoosh)

01:41.372 --> 01:43.334
SOMEONE WAS DROWNING ME.

01:43.334 --> 01:45.206
AND IN THE END,

01:45.206 --> 01:48.239
I WAS DEAD.

01:48.239 --> 01:52.483
PEOPLE ASK ME ALL THE TIME
TO INTERPRET WHAT THEY SAW,

01:52.483 --> 01:54.745
AND I CAN'T.

01:54.745 --> 01:58.819
ULTIMATELY, INTERPRETATION
IS YOUR RESPONSIBILITY.

01:58.819 --> 02:02.193
HOW COULD MY DROWNING BE GOOD?

02:02.193 --> 02:05.196
WHAT IF YOU WERE BEING BAPTIZED?
WOULDN'T THAT BE A GOOD THING?

02:05.196 --> 02:07.658
BUT THEN WHY WAS I STRUGGLING?
I'M SORRY TO SAY

02:07.658 --> 02:09.660
I'VE DROPPED
MORE THAN ONE PERSON

02:09.660 --> 02:12.463
IN A FULL-IMMERSION BAPTISM...
WATER GETS UP THEIR NOSE.

02:12.463 --> 02:15.206
THEY FREAK OUT, SLIP AWAY.
BUT I DIED.

02:15.206 --> 02:17.768
OR FAINTED.

02:17.768 --> 02:20.841
MY POINT HERE IS THAT THESE
VISIONS ARE JUST A SNAPSHOT.

02:20.841 --> 02:22.843
YOU ONLY SEE A SMALL PORTION.

02:22.843 --> 02:24.845
THINK OF JESUS
AND HIS SACRIFICE.

02:24.845 --> 02:26.847
TO HIS DISCIPLES,
IT WAS A TRAGEDY

02:26.847 --> 02:29.680
BECAUSE THEY COULDN'T SEE
THE BIGGER PICTURE.

02:29.680 --> 02:34.185
IT'S A NEW REALITY
FOR EVERYONE WHO CAME AFTER.

02:34.185 --> 02:35.826
IS THAT WHAT YOU THINK
IS HAPPENING NOW?

02:35.826 --> 02:39.930
IT'S NOT FATE
VERSUS FREE WILL.

02:39.930 --> 02:43.234
IT'S FATE AND FREE WILL.

02:43.234 --> 02:47.698
BUT HEY, I'M JUST
A SUPER RELIGIOUS WEIRDO DUDE.

02:47.698 --> 02:51.342
YOU DON'T HAVE
TO BELIEVE ANYTHING I SAY.

02:51.342 --> 02:57.708
BUT EVERY DAY, GOD PUTS
SOMETHING GOOD IN YOUR LIFE.

02:57.708 --> 02:59.880
EMBRACE IT...

02:59.880 --> 03:04.385
AND LET ALL THE OTHER STUFF
FALL AWAY.

03:06.717 --> 03:09.890
THE CHALLENGE WE FACE

03:09.890 --> 03:12.893
IS RECOGNIZING THAT THE ANSWERS
TO OUR MOST BURNING QUESTIONS

03:12.893 --> 03:15.726
MAY BE RIGHT IN FRONT OF US.

03:26.707 --> 03:28.709
(car engine starts)

03:29.910 --> 03:32.913
YOU SURE YOU DON'T WANT TO TRY
OUR TOFURKY SOY CHEESESTEAK?

03:32.913 --> 03:35.286
IT'S ON SPECIAL.

03:35.286 --> 03:39.390
I'M POSITIVE.
I REALLY WISH I COULD HAVE BEEN
MORE HELP TO YOU,

03:39.390 --> 03:41.622
BUT SINCE I DON'T EVEN
KNOW WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR...
ME NEITHER. THANKS ANYWAY.

03:41.622 --> 03:44.525
YEAH, NO PROBLEM.

03:46.727 --> 03:50.000
WHEN DID YOU GUYS
CHANGE LOCATIONS?

03:50.000 --> 03:52.803
ABOUT A MONTH AGO. WE HAD
A FIRE DURING THE BLACKOUT.

03:52.803 --> 03:54.805
LUCKILY, I GOT MY MONEY

03:54.805 --> 03:58.939
BEFORE THE INSURANCE COMPANY
WENT BROKE.
WHERE WAS YOUR OLD LOCATION?

03:58.939 --> 04:00.941
I'M NOT SAYING HE'S BAD.

04:00.941 --> 04:04.244
I JUST THINK MOST RELIGION
IS A KIND OF CLUB

04:04.244 --> 04:07.278
DESIGNED TO KEEP SOME PEOPLE IN
AND SOME PEOPLE OUT.

04:07.278 --> 04:09.920
WELL, IF IT MAKES YOU FEEL
BETTER ABOUT YOUR LIFE,

04:09.920 --> 04:13.284
WHAT DIFFERENCE DOES IT MAKE?
WELL, I'M GLAD
YOU'RE FEELING BETTER.

04:13.284 --> 04:17.858
I JUST WANT YOU
TO BE CAREFUL.
YOU KNOW WHAT? UM, MAYBE
THIS WASN'T THE BEST IDEA.

04:17.858 --> 04:21.031
YOU KNOW, EVEN WHEN
HER MEDICINE'S WORKING,

04:21.031 --> 04:23.664
SHE'S... ODD,
AND IT'S UNPREDICTABLE.

04:23.664 --> 04:25.666
HEY, I WANT TO HANG OUT.

04:25.666 --> 04:28.839
SO THERE'S NOTHING
TO BE AFRAID OF.

04:28.839 --> 04:30.401
OKAY?

04:30.401 --> 04:34.775
ALL RIGHT, BUT IF YOU WANT
TO BAIL, I TOTALLY UNDERSTAND.

04:34.775 --> 04:37.277
(door opens, closes)

04:45.886 --> 04:48.018
(Nicole) MOM,
THIS IS MY FRIEND BRYCE.

04:48.018 --> 04:49.990
WE WORK TOGETHER
AT THE HOSPITAL.

04:49.990 --> 04:53.394
DON'T TOUCH MY HAIR. YOU'LL
SCARE THE BUTTERFLIES AWAY.

04:53.394 --> 04:57.728
SO THIS IS THE REASON
FOR ALL THE PENNIES?

04:57.728 --> 05:01.001
YOU BROUGHT PENNIES?

05:01.001 --> 05:03.474
YEAH, I GOT A BUNCH TODAY.

05:06.877 --> 05:09.309
YOU'RE A DOCTOR?

05:09.309 --> 05:10.541
YEAH.

05:10.541 --> 05:12.743
I'VE BEEN STRUCK
BY LIGHTNING SIX TIMES.

05:12.743 --> 05:14.815
WOW.

05:14.815 --> 05:17.317
(mouths word)

05:17.317 --> 05:20.921
CAN I HELP WITH THE WALL?

05:20.921 --> 05:24.525
ONLY USE THE ONES
MARKED 1989.

05:24.525 --> 05:26.897
THAT'S THE YEAR
THAT NICOLE WAS BORN.

05:28.999 --> 05:30.100
NICE.

05:30.100 --> 05:32.763
THIS WHOLE THING IS
A TRIBUTE TO HER.

05:34.765 --> 05:38.008
YOU NEVER TOLD ME THAT.

05:38.008 --> 05:40.511
YOU NEVER ASKED.

05:40.511 --> 05:42.813
ACTUALLY, WE WERE JUST
DISCUSSING A QUESTION

05:42.813 --> 05:44.815
THAT'S BEEN BOTHERING US--

05:44.815 --> 05:47.548
DO YOU THINK GOD
CAUSED THE FLASH-FORWARD?

05:47.548 --> 05:49.920
FLASH-FORWARD?

05:49.920 --> 05:52.683
SO WHAT? PEOPLE ARE CRYING
ABOUT IT. BOOHOO.

05:52.683 --> 05:54.485
IT'S NOT THE END OF THE WORLD.

05:54.485 --> 05:57.788
I HAVE A HALLUCINATION
EVERY DAY. NOBODY GIVES A DAMN.

05:57.788 --> 06:00.391
AND IF YOU WANT
TO KNOW ABOUT GOD,

06:00.391 --> 06:03.994
WHAT SOME PEOPLE
CALL COINCIDENCE...

06:03.994 --> 06:06.937
IS REALLY GOD AT WORK.

06:06.937 --> 06:10.601
NO,
THAT MAKES PERFECT SENSE.

06:10.601 --> 06:12.873
FOUND ONE.
GLUE'S RIGHT THERE.

06:14.605 --> 06:17.548
OH, AND START THE MUSIC,
WILL YOU?

06:17.548 --> 06:20.010
SURE.

06:26.056 --> 06:29.890
(The Staples Singers'
"What You Gonna Do?" playing)

06:32.893 --> 06:34.625
COME ON, GIRL.

06:34.625 --> 06:36.697
SHOW HIM HOW IT'S DONE.

06:43.434 --> 06:45.436
â™ª WHAT â™ª

06:45.436 --> 06:47.107
â™ª YOU GONNA DO? â™ª

06:47.107 --> 06:49.039
â™ª WHEN â™ª

06:49.039 --> 06:50.881
(grunts)

06:50.881 --> 06:53.944
(gasps)

06:53.944 --> 06:57.588
I COME BEARING GIFTS.

07:00.691 --> 07:03.153
YOUR SON WEARS A SIZE 4 SHOE.

07:03.153 --> 07:05.195
HIS PHYSICAL THERAPIST'S NAME
IS JOANIE.

07:05.195 --> 07:07.157
AND FINALLY...

07:07.157 --> 07:10.461
(gasps)
THESE WERE TAKEN
BEFORE THE BLACKOUT.

07:10.461 --> 07:13.163
WE'VE HAD YOUR FAMILY
UNDER SURVEILLANCE

07:13.163 --> 07:15.966
FOR QUITE SOME TIME.
(telephone rings)

07:15.966 --> 07:17.708
HEY.
Hey.

07:17.708 --> 07:20.811
(siren wailing)
WE GOT A LEAD ON
OUR MISSING QUANTUM PHYSICIST.

07:20.811 --> 07:23.874
L.A.P.D. AND S.W.A.T.
ARE BACKING US UP.
Where'd you find 'em?

07:23.874 --> 07:26.547
WE TRACKED THE AMBULANCE
TO A RESTAURANT

07:26.547 --> 07:28.178
THAT'S BEEN ABANDONED
SINCE THE BLACKOUT.

07:28.178 --> 07:30.881
Infrared's catching
four guys inside.

07:30.881 --> 07:32.953
YOU WANT IN ON THE TAKEDOWN?
Text me the address.

07:32.953 --> 07:36.957
(sirens wailing,
police radio chatter)

07:36.957 --> 07:39.830
IF YOU CARE ABOUT YOUR SON,

07:39.830 --> 07:42.993
YOU WILL WANT TO CONSIDER YOUR
NEXT RESPONSE VERY CAREFULLY.

07:42.993 --> 07:45.966
HOW... MANY...

07:45.966 --> 07:48.839
ELECTRON VOLTS WERE GENERATED?

07:51.001 --> 07:52.943
(siren wailing)

07:52.943 --> 07:56.006
(police radio chatter)

07:56.006 --> 07:59.109
C.E.R.N. CAN GENERATE
UP TO 500 TERAELECTRON VOLTS.

07:59.109 --> 08:01.712
AM I IN THE BALLPARK?

08:01.712 --> 08:04.585
YOU'RE...
YOU'RE THINKING TOO SMALL.

08:04.585 --> 08:08.058
WE CRACKED
THE PETA-ELECTRON VOLT BARRIER.

08:08.058 --> 08:13.263
YOU GENERATED MORE THAN
A QUADRILLION ELECTRON VOLTS?

08:17.027 --> 08:19.099
(police radio chatter)

08:19.099 --> 08:22.102
(men speaking indistinctly)

08:22.102 --> 08:24.575
(man speaks indistinctly)
BREAK IT DOWN!

08:24.575 --> 08:27.608
AND WHAT ABOUT
TACHYONIC DARK MATTER?

08:27.608 --> 08:30.581
DID YOU FIND IT?
WE CAME CLOSE.

08:30.581 --> 08:33.043
(men shouting indistinctly)

08:33.043 --> 08:34.985
WE FOUND CHARGE CONJUGATION--

08:34.985 --> 08:40.591
A CERTAIN BREAKDOWN
IN TIME SYMMETRY.

08:40.591 --> 08:42.593
(men shouting indistinctly)

08:42.593 --> 08:46.056
WHAT DO WE GOT?
WHAT DO WE GOT?
(man) CLEAR HERE!

08:46.056 --> 08:49.229
CLEAN THIS UP.
GET RID OF HIM.

08:49.229 --> 08:53.033
(man) TAKE THE STAIRS!
TAKE THE STAIRS!

08:56.707 --> 08:58.909
(beeping rapidly)

08:58.909 --> 09:00.671
BOMB!
GO!

09:00.671 --> 09:03.543
(men shouting indistinctly)

09:03.543 --> 09:05.045
(grunts)

09:19.860 --> 09:24.034
(siren wailing)
(men speaking indistinctly)

09:24.034 --> 09:28.038
THE BOMB WAS KEYED
TO 842.3 MEGAHERTZ.

09:28.038 --> 09:30.941
THAT'S A BUREAU FREQUENCY.

09:30.941 --> 09:32.903
WHEN WE CAME ROLLING IN HERE,

09:32.903 --> 09:36.907
OUR RADIOS TRIGGERED
THE EXPLOSIVE.
THAT'S NOT
YOUR EVERYDAY KIDNAPPERS.

09:36.907 --> 09:39.009
NO. THEY'RE SENDING
A CLEAR MESSAGE--

09:39.009 --> 09:40.580
DON'T GO WHERE
YOU AREN'T INVITED.

09:40.580 --> 09:43.113
DON'T GO TO PIGEON, UTAH.
DON'T GO TO WASHINGTON, D.C.

09:43.113 --> 09:46.917
BUT IT OCCURS TO ME
THAT IF MARK SAW THEM

09:46.917 --> 09:50.320
IN HIS VISION,
THEY SAW HIM, TOO.

09:50.320 --> 09:53.894
BEGINNING ON OCTOBER 6th,

09:53.894 --> 09:56.967
THEY KNEW THAT YOU AND MARK WERE
AT THE CENTER OF THIS THING.

09:56.967 --> 09:58.969
HOW THEY PLAN ON
USING THAT KNOWLEDGE,

09:58.969 --> 10:02.302
THAT'S WHAT WE NEED
TO BE THINKING ABOUT.

10:10.140 --> 10:13.914
OH. HEY. YOU'RE, UH...

10:13.914 --> 10:16.987
NICOLE'S FRIEND
FROM THIS AFTERNOON.

10:16.987 --> 10:19.249
BRYCE. UH, WE WORK TOGETHER
AT THE HOSPITAL.
RIGHT.

10:19.249 --> 10:21.852
IS SHE FEELING BETTER?
SHE'S BETTER, ACTUALLY.

10:21.852 --> 10:24.655
UM, THAT'S--THAT'S
THE REASON THAT I'M HERE

10:24.655 --> 10:27.027
TO TALK TO YOU TONIGHT.
LOOK, SHE'S A GREAT GIRL,

10:27.027 --> 10:31.101
AND THIS--THIS WHOLE THING--
THIS--THIS RELIGION THING--

10:31.101 --> 10:33.633
I'M NOT QUITE SURE
WHAT YOU'RE SELLING HERE,

10:33.633 --> 10:36.937
BUT I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE
SHE DOESN'T GET HURT.
WELL, I'M NOT SURE
IF YOU'LL BELIEVE ME, BRYCE,

10:36.937 --> 10:38.939
BUT I'M NOT SELLING ANYTHING.

10:38.939 --> 10:41.111
I'M JUST RECEIVING
A GIFT FROM GOD

10:41.111 --> 10:43.313
OF A VISION OF MYSELF
ON APRIL 29th.

10:43.313 --> 10:46.376
WHAT I SAW OPENED ME UP TO
THE IDEA THAT EVERYONE'S PURPOSE

10:46.376 --> 10:49.950
IS TO GIVE AND RECEIVE LOVE,
SIMPLE AS THAT.

10:49.950 --> 10:55.786
MY JOB IS TO GIVE THAT MESSAGE
TO AS MANY PEOPLE AS POSSIBLE.

10:55.786 --> 10:58.058
NO ONE EVER GOT HURT

10:58.058 --> 11:00.691
GETTING A LITTLE MORE LOVE
INTO THEIR LIFE.

11:00.691 --> 11:02.693
WHAT ARE YOU AFRAID OF?

11:20.951 --> 11:24.314
(Shanti Shanti's "Beloved Son"
playing)

11:34.094 --> 11:35.966
(car door opens and closes)

11:35.966 --> 11:37.798
(engine starts)

11:37.798 --> 11:40.901
(vehicle departs)

11:44.034 --> 11:48.008
â™ªâ™ª

11:51.441 --> 11:56.246
(crowd cheering)

11:56.246 --> 11:59.820
GOD HAS PUT US IN THIS PLACE,

11:59.820 --> 12:03.493
AT THIS TIME,
TO DO SOMETHING!

12:03.493 --> 12:06.897
(cheering)
GOD IS BREAKING
INTO HUMAN HISTORY

12:06.897 --> 12:09.800
IN A WAY
THAT'S NEVER HAPPENED BEFORE.

12:09.800 --> 12:15.966
AND YOU--YOU ARE RIGHT
AT THE CENTER OF EVERYTHING!

12:15.966 --> 12:19.810
â™ªâ™ª

12:22.412 --> 12:24.444
GO TO HELL, LLOYD.

12:24.444 --> 12:27.417
Look, you have every right
to hate me, but--
LISTEN, I DON'T HATE YOU.

12:27.417 --> 12:30.020
I JUST WISH YOU WERE STANDING
BEHIND THE 8 BALL

12:30.020 --> 12:32.983
WHEN I CAME CRASHING THROUGH.

12:35.025 --> 12:37.958
(tires screech)

12:56.106 --> 12:58.378
(tires screech)

13:21.271 --> 13:25.005
(gunfire continues)

13:42.422 --> 13:44.194
(car door alert chimes)

13:44.194 --> 13:46.496
(grunting)

14:02.412 --> 14:05.115
(Simon) HEY!
WAIT. WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.

14:05.115 --> 14:08.578
WORD OF ADVICE--NEXT TIME,
TAKE THE TRIGGER FINGER.

14:11.982 --> 14:13.423
(gun clatters)

14:13.423 --> 14:15.986
(men speaking indistinctly)
(man) LET'S GO! BRING IT BACK!

14:15.986 --> 14:17.888
(helicopter whirring overhead)

14:17.888 --> 14:19.890
(man) ALL RIGHT,
CHECK THE V.T.L.,

14:19.890 --> 14:21.992
SEE WHAT WE GOT ON THIS GUY.

14:21.992 --> 14:24.194
(man) OKAY,
HOLD IT UP RIGHT THERE.

14:26.566 --> 14:28.238
(man) YEAH, RIGHT THERE.

14:38.048 --> 14:40.380
I WAS AFRAID THIS WAS
MY ONLY CHANCE.

14:51.121 --> 14:53.163
HOW THE HELL
DID YOU FIND US?

14:53.163 --> 14:54.664
YOU CALLED ME.

14:54.664 --> 14:59.199
WE WERE TALKING ON THE PHONE
TOGETHER IN OUR FLASH-FORWARDS.

15:01.972 --> 15:04.504
NOW IT'S TIME FOR YOU
TO TELL ME EVERYTHING.

15:09.239 --> 15:12.082
(man) THE PAINKILLER I GAVE YOU
SHOULD BE TAKING EFFECT.

15:12.082 --> 15:14.084
HOW ARE YOU FEELING?

15:14.084 --> 15:16.416
I'VE BEEN BETTER.
(ambulance door closes)

15:16.416 --> 15:20.420
(grunts)

15:20.420 --> 15:24.594
WELL, THAT DIDN'T GO QUITE
AS WELL AS PLANNED, DID IT?

15:24.594 --> 15:26.596
I'D GIVE YOU THE FINGER,

15:26.596 --> 15:29.159
BUT I'M RUNNING OUT
OF ONES TO SPARE.

15:29.159 --> 15:33.063
I IMPROVISED. I HAD TO.
WE WEREN'T GETTING ANY RESULTS,

15:33.063 --> 15:36.706
AND WE NEEDED TO DIRECT
SUSPICION AWAY FROM YOU.

15:36.706 --> 15:41.211
I THINK WE'VE ACCOMPLISHED THAT
FOR TONIGHT, IF NOTHING ELSE.

15:41.211 --> 15:43.213
FORGET IT.

15:43.213 --> 15:45.675
I'M DONE BEING YOUR BITCH.

15:45.675 --> 15:47.947
REALLY?

15:47.947 --> 15:51.221
(beep)
THEN I SUPPOSE YOU WON'T
MIND IF I HAVE A TALK

15:51.221 --> 15:56.286
WITH THE AUTHORITIES ABOUT
THE MAN IN THIS VIDEO.

15:56.286 --> 15:59.029
AS OF THIS MOMENT, THE WORLD
THINKS YOU AND SIMCOE

15:59.029 --> 16:01.091
ACCIDENTALLY CAUSED
THIS BLACKOUT.

16:01.091 --> 16:03.093
WHAT HAPPENS IF THEY FIND OUT

16:03.093 --> 16:05.465
YOU WERE AWAKE
WHILE IT HAPPENED?

16:24.114 --> 16:26.116
"SO WE'LL GO
NO MORE A-ROVING,

16:26.116 --> 16:28.118
"SO LATE INTO THE NIGHT,

16:28.118 --> 16:31.021
"THOUGH THE HEART
BE STILL AS LOVING

16:31.021 --> 16:34.124
"AND THE MOON
BE STILL AS BRIGHT.

16:34.124 --> 16:37.997
"FOR THE SWORD
OUTWEARS ITS SHEATH,

16:37.997 --> 16:39.999
"AND THE SOUL
WEARS OUT THE BREAST,

16:39.999 --> 16:42.472
AND THE HEART
MUST PAUSE TO BREATHE..."

16:42.472 --> 16:45.035
(lowers voice)
SHE'LL BE OKAY.

16:45.035 --> 16:47.137
WE ALL WILL.

16:47.137 --> 16:50.310
I CAN'T BELIEVE DAD
IS GONE.

16:50.310 --> 16:53.183
"WE'LL GO NO MORE A-ROVING

16:53.183 --> 16:56.146
BY THE LIGHT OF THE MOON."

16:56.146 --> 16:59.189
OKAY. WELL, I HAVE TO TAKE CARE
OF THE FUNERAL HOME,

16:59.189 --> 17:02.021
BUT I'LL MEET YOU BACK
AT THE HOUSE. I WON'T BE LONG.

17:04.154 --> 17:05.395
(crying)

17:05.395 --> 17:07.397
(whispers) IT'S ALL RIGHT.

17:07.397 --> 17:10.230
IT'S ALL RIGHT.

17:19.339 --> 17:22.172
THIS ISN'T THE WAY
TO THE FUNERAL HOME.

17:22.172 --> 17:24.644
OH, YOU WON'T BE GOING THERE,
MR. CAMPOS.
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

17:24.644 --> 17:29.048
I HAVE INSTRUCTIONS TO DELIVER
YOU TO THE LAKESIDE HELIPORT.

17:29.048 --> 17:33.052
FROM THERE YOU WILL BE AIRLIFTED
TO YOUR FINAL DESTINATION.
I'M IN THE MIDDLE
OF MY FATHER'S FUNERAL.

17:33.052 --> 17:37.227
WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON?
I DON'T KNOW. I JUST DRIVE.

17:37.227 --> 17:40.830
THIS TICKET IS YOURS.
MY BOSS WILL BE CONTACTING YOU.

17:40.830 --> 17:42.592
GO, TEAM.

17:42.592 --> 17:44.564
(man over P.A.) FOR DETROIT,

17:44.564 --> 17:46.536
SECOND BASEMAN, NUMBER 17--

17:46.536 --> 17:48.698
RICHIE...

17:48.698 --> 17:51.471
(crowd cheering loudly)

17:53.643 --> 17:58.308
I'VE JUST ABOUT HAD ENOUGH.
WHO THE HELL IS THIS?

17:58.308 --> 18:01.251
(man) You don't get
to ask questions here.

18:01.251 --> 18:04.154
You've been part of this
since you were 13.

18:04.154 --> 18:06.486
We've given you
a lot of leeway.

18:06.486 --> 18:10.190
In fact, we haven't asked
much of you over the years.

18:10.190 --> 18:13.393
Truth be told,
you've had it kind of easy.

18:13.393 --> 18:16.496
SO NOW WE WANT YOU TO DO
EXACTLY WHAT WE SAY.

18:16.496 --> 18:19.829
GET TO YOUR SEAT.
WE'RE RUNNING OUT OF TIME.

18:19.829 --> 18:21.831
(man) YO, GET TWO BEERS!

18:28.578 --> 18:30.280
SIT DOWN.

18:30.280 --> 18:34.184
There's a tub of popcorn
in front of you.

18:34.184 --> 18:36.886
START EATING.

18:36.886 --> 18:41.391
(indistinct conversations)

18:46.456 --> 18:48.598
THERE'S A RING
INSIDE THE BOX.

18:48.598 --> 18:51.261
PUT IT ON.

18:51.261 --> 18:54.564
Put it on now.
We're running out of time.

18:54.564 --> 18:56.406
(man) BEER HERE!
(man) SIT DOWN!

18:56.406 --> 18:58.608
(man) WHOO!
(bat strikes ball)

18:58.608 --> 19:00.910
(crowd cheering)
(man) FRESH PEANUTS!

19:00.910 --> 19:03.142
(man) THAT'S WHAT
I'M TALKING ABOUT!
FRESH PEANUTS!

19:10.149 --> 19:12.151
ATTENTION, PLEASE.

19:12.151 --> 19:14.424
NOW BATTING FOR SAMUELS--
NUMBER 9...

19:14.424 --> 19:16.256
(speaks indistinctly)

19:16.256 --> 19:19.259
(rumbling)

19:25.365 --> 19:27.937
(jet approaching)

19:43.853 --> 19:46.886
(car alarms blaring,
explosions in distance)

19:46.886 --> 19:49.719
(cell phone rings)

19:49.719 --> 19:51.691
(beep)
YEAH?

19:51.691 --> 19:55.795
NOW LISTEN TO MY INSTRUCTIONS.
WALK INTO THE NEAREST TUNNEL.

20:24.223 --> 20:25.725
HELLO, SON.

20:25.725 --> 20:27.927
WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON?

20:27.927 --> 20:29.899
GIVE ME THE RING BACK.

20:36.005 --> 20:38.237
FOLLOW ME.

20:56.456 --> 20:58.958
(woman speaks indistinctly
over P.A.)

20:58.958 --> 21:00.960
(knock on door)

21:00.960 --> 21:03.963
(Olivia) MR. CAMPOS?
I NEED YOU IN BED, PLEASE.

21:03.963 --> 21:05.965
NOW.

21:11.941 --> 21:14.504
DO YOU KNOW
HOW OFTEN I HEAR THAT?

21:14.504 --> 21:16.506
UH-HUH. SIT.

21:16.506 --> 21:20.380
WHAT'S TAKING SO LONG? I WAS
READY TO LEAVE SIX HOURS AGO.

21:20.380 --> 21:21.981
YOU CAME IN
WITH A CONCUSSION,

21:21.981 --> 21:24.554
SO WE NEEDED TO KEEP YOU IN
FOR OBSERVATION.

21:24.554 --> 21:26.856
OH, BETTY.
I NEVER KNEW YOU CARED.

21:26.856 --> 21:28.658
(clatter)
BETTY?

21:28.658 --> 21:30.520
MY PEDIATRICIAN GROWING UP.

21:30.520 --> 21:32.892
YOU REMIND ME OF HER.

21:32.892 --> 21:36.496
I HAD SUCH A CRUSH.
READY, SPORT?

21:36.496 --> 21:39.028
(pills rattle)
GOT YOUR PRESCRIPTION
FILLED AT THE PHARMACY.

21:39.028 --> 21:40.970
MAKE SURE YOU TAKE
ALL THE DOSES.

21:40.970 --> 21:42.972
I DO NOT NEED YOU
AS A BOUNCE BACK.

21:42.972 --> 21:45.004
MM. YES, BETTY.

21:45.004 --> 21:46.936
HE IS ALL YOURS.

21:46.936 --> 21:48.878
HALLELUJAH.

21:48.878 --> 21:52.912
THE SHEETS ARE SCRATCHY.
THE FOOD IS VILE.

21:52.912 --> 21:55.515
I DON'T LIKE PEOPLE
WATCHING ME SLEEP.
(mutters)

21:55.515 --> 21:57.387
IS ALL THIS
REALLY NECESSARY?

21:57.387 --> 22:00.520
YOU WERE KIDNAPPED AND TORTURED.
IT'S FOR YOUR OWN PROTECTION.

22:00.520 --> 22:03.553
WELL, WITH ALL DUE RESPECT,
I CAN PROTECT MYSELF.

22:03.553 --> 22:06.756
WITH ALL DUE RESPECT,
YOU CAN'T.

22:06.756 --> 22:08.758
YOU ARE OFFICIALLY
AND INDEFINITELY DETAINED

22:08.758 --> 22:11.361
UNDER INVESTIGATION BY
THE W.M.D. DIRECTORATE

22:11.361 --> 22:13.803
WITHIN THE FBI's
NATIONAL SECURITY BRANCH.

22:13.803 --> 22:15.805
I VOLUNTEERED MY SERVICES.

22:15.805 --> 22:18.508
AND WE APPRECIATE THAT,
BUT FROM NOW ON,

22:18.508 --> 22:20.970
WE OWN YOU.

22:20.970 --> 22:23.743
AM I UNDER ARREST?

22:23.743 --> 22:26.045
I DON'T KNOW.
HAVE YOU BROKEN ANY LAWS?

22:26.045 --> 22:27.747
NOT UNLESS IT'S ILLEGAL
TO BE KIDNAPPED

22:27.747 --> 22:30.650
IN FRONT OF YOUR OWN SON,
BEATEN HALF TO DEATH

22:30.650 --> 22:33.423
AND HELD CAPTIVE, NO.
WELL,
I GOTTA HAND IT TO HIM--

22:33.423 --> 22:35.425
HE FOUND THEM.
I'VE ALREADY TOLD
THE OTHER AGENTS

22:35.425 --> 22:37.527
EVERYTHING I COULD REMEMBER.
THE GUY'S A LOOSE CANNON.

22:37.527 --> 22:39.529
LOOSE CANNON OR NOT,
MARK MANAGED TO DO

22:39.529 --> 22:41.591
WHAT THE REST OF US COULDN'T--
ON HIS OWN.

22:41.591 --> 22:44.093
JANIS IS BRINGING CAMPOS
BACK HERE FROM THE HOSPITAL.

22:44.093 --> 22:46.736
WHEN SHE DOES, WE NEED TO START
DOUBLE-TEAMING THESE TWO,

22:46.736 --> 22:50.770
THEN COMPARE THEIR STORIES.
I KNOW I'M SUPPOSED TO
FEEL PITY FOR YOU, MR. SIMCOE,

22:50.770 --> 22:52.902
BUT CONSIDERING
THE CIRCUMSTANCES,

22:52.902 --> 22:56.005
EXCUSE ME IF I DON'T.
YOU'VE KNOWN ALL THIS TIME

22:56.005 --> 22:58.107
THERE WAS GONNA BE
ANOTHER BLACKOUT.

22:58.107 --> 23:01.150
WHY DIDN'T YOU STEP FORWARD?
I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU WANT ME
TO TELL YOU, AGENT BENFORD.

23:01.150 --> 23:04.984
LET'S START WITH THE TRUTH.
HOW ABOUT THIS--
20 MILLION PEOPLE DIED,

23:04.984 --> 23:08.017
POSSIBLY PRECIPITATED
BY SOMETHING I DID.

23:08.017 --> 23:11.421
I HAVE A VISION IN WHICH
A DRUNK MAN TELLS ME

23:11.421 --> 23:13.423
ANOTHER BLACKOUT IS COMING--

23:13.423 --> 23:16.996
NO FURTHER INFORMATION,
NO CONTEXT, NO SUBSTANTIATION.

23:16.996 --> 23:18.998
NOW YOU TELL ME--
UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES,

23:18.998 --> 23:23.032
WHAT DO YOU EXPECT ME TO DO?
HOW ABOUT CONTACT
THE AUTHORITIES,

23:23.032 --> 23:25.034
GIVE 'EM A LITTLE HEADS-UP?

23:25.034 --> 23:27.006
WHAT, LIKE YOU DID?

23:27.006 --> 23:30.009
WHY DIDN'T YOU COME IN HERE
AND TELL YOUR COLLEAGUES

23:30.009 --> 23:32.882
THERE WAS GONNA BE
ANOTHER BLACKOUT?
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT YOU HERE.

23:32.882 --> 23:37.487
FINE.
APRIL 29th--
THE DAY OF OUR VISIONS...

23:37.487 --> 23:40.950
YOU CALLED ME, AND CONSIDERING
WHERE YOU WERE,

23:40.950 --> 23:43.993
YOU HAD TO HAVE HAD
A DAMN GOOD REASON.

23:43.993 --> 23:46.526
I NEED TO KNOW
YOUR SIDE OF THINGS,

23:46.526 --> 23:49.599
AND RIGHT NOW YOU'RE NOT
TELLING ME EVERYTHING.

23:49.599 --> 23:52.662
IN FACT, YOU'RE NOT
TELLING ME ANYTHING.

23:52.662 --> 23:55.004
AND NO, TECHNICALLY YOU'RE
NOT UNDER ARREST RIGHT NOW.

23:55.004 --> 23:57.106
OH, GOOD. CAN I GO THEN?

23:57.106 --> 23:59.839
THE DAY'S NOT OVER YET.
(door closes)

23:59.839 --> 24:01.841
WHEN CAN I SEE LLOYD?

24:01.841 --> 24:03.843
I NEED TO TALK TO HIM
ALONE.

24:03.843 --> 24:05.845
ARE YOU JUST
NOT LISTENING TO ME?

24:05.845 --> 24:07.847
YOU'RE NOT DOING
ANYTHING ALONE.

24:07.847 --> 24:09.819
HE'LL BE IN DEBRIEFINGS
ALL DAY.

24:09.819 --> 24:12.121
WELL, CAN I GO HOME FIRST,
AT LEAST?

24:12.121 --> 24:14.223
DUDE, YOU LIVE IN A HOTEL.

24:14.223 --> 24:15.985
IT'S GOT THIS AMAZING SHOWER,

24:15.985 --> 24:18.988
AND IT SPRAYS WATER ON YOU
IN ALL DIRECTIONS.
OH, YOU HAVE GOT...

24:18.988 --> 24:23.192
AND THE TOWELS--
WHITE, FLUFFY, WARM.

24:23.192 --> 24:25.194
ARE YOU SERIOUS?

24:25.194 --> 24:28.137
DOES THAT CRAP
ACTUALLY WORK ON WOMEN?

24:28.137 --> 24:30.970
MY ATTEMPT IS NOT
TO SEDUCE BUT TO DISARM,

24:30.970 --> 24:32.972
IN THE PHYSIC SENSE.
OH.

24:32.972 --> 24:35.204
AN UNSTABLE ELEMENT
TRANSFORMS.

24:35.204 --> 24:39.008
HUH.
I FIND THAT PEOPLE ARE
A LITTLE BIT MORE HONEST

24:39.008 --> 24:41.951
WHEN YOU... DISARM THEM.

24:41.951 --> 24:44.083
(breathing heavily)

24:44.083 --> 24:46.085
WHAT'S GOING ON?

24:46.085 --> 24:47.957
I DON'T KNOW.
SOMETHING'S WEIRD...

24:47.957 --> 24:50.890
SOMETHING WEIRD.
OOH. WANT SOME WATER
OR SOMETHING?

24:50.890 --> 24:52.792
NO, I'M OKAY.

24:52.792 --> 24:55.064
(breathing heavily)
I'M OKAY.

24:55.064 --> 24:56.796
YOU'RE DEFINITELY NOT OKAY.

24:56.796 --> 24:58.928
PENICILLIN.

24:58.928 --> 25:01.070
YOU'RE ALLERGIC?
YEAH.

25:01.070 --> 25:03.502
OKAY. HELP!
ANAPHYLACTIC...

25:03.502 --> 25:06.976
HELP! OKAY. HOLD ON. HOLD ON.

25:06.976 --> 25:08.838
(gasping)

25:17.917 --> 25:20.950
(sighs)

25:31.200 --> 25:35.134
(jets roaring)

25:35.134 --> 25:38.067
(woman over P.A.) ROYAL TORONTO
FLIGHT 67 FROM LONDON

25:38.067 --> 25:41.941
IS NOW ARRIVING AT GATE 122.

25:41.941 --> 25:43.943
ROYAL TORONTO...
(speaks indistinctly)

25:43.943 --> 25:45.945
REALLY?

25:45.945 --> 25:48.578
WOW.
DID YOU REALLY THINK

25:48.578 --> 25:51.180
YOU COULD LEAVE THE COUNTRY
WITHOUT BEING NOTICED?

25:51.180 --> 25:54.253
"COUNTRY" IS SUCH A LOOSE TERM.
IT'S CANADA.

25:54.253 --> 25:57.857
LET'S GO.
WHERE ARE WE GOING?

25:57.857 --> 25:59.989
GATE D-12. THEY'RE HOLDING
A FLIGHT BACK TO L.A.

25:59.989 --> 26:02.932
LOOK, I'M TRIED OF
BEING TOLD WHAT TO DO,

26:02.932 --> 26:05.234
WHEN TO DO IT, BEING--
BEING TREATED LIKE A CRIMINAL?
GET USED TO IT.

26:05.234 --> 26:07.236
YOU CAN'T MAKE ME
GO WITH YOU.

26:07.236 --> 26:10.700
YEAH, YOU'RE RIGHT.
I CAN'T. BUT THEY CAN.

26:10.700 --> 26:13.703
(police radio chatter)

26:16.075 --> 26:20.079
24 HOURS IN TORONTO.
THAT'S ALL I ASK.

26:20.079 --> 26:22.652
COME ON.
LOOK, I'M SORRY ABOUT EARLIER.

26:22.652 --> 26:24.654
REALLY I AM, BUT IT'S
IMPORTANT THAT I'M HERE.

26:24.654 --> 26:26.656
MORE IMPORTANT THAN
THE GLOBAL BLACKOUT?

26:26.656 --> 26:29.258
GAME OVER, SIMON.
THERE'S SOME PERSONAL STUFF
GOING ON WITH MY FAMILY.

26:29.258 --> 26:31.961
IT'S--IT'S IMPORTANT.
THERE'S SOME THINGS GOING ON.

26:31.961 --> 26:34.664
LISTEN, I'M REALLY SORRY
YOUR SISTER RAN AWAY.

26:34.664 --> 26:37.166
I AM. BUT WE CAN'T
JUST LET YOU LEAVE.
HOW DO YOU KNOW
ABOUT ANNABELLE?

26:37.166 --> 26:40.830
POLICE REPORTS.
YOUR MOM'S BEEN WRITING TO HER

26:40.830 --> 26:43.132
IN THE PERSONALS SECTION
OF "THE GLOBE AND MAIL."

26:43.132 --> 26:45.805
(elevator bell dings)
YOU'RE NOT THE ONLY ONE
WHO'S GOOD AT THEIR JOB.

26:45.805 --> 26:49.278
I SAID I WOULD BE HERE
TO HELP FIND HER.

26:49.278 --> 26:51.280
(woman speaks indistinctly)

26:51.280 --> 26:55.244
(clicks button)
PLEASE. IT'S IMPORTANT.

26:59.989 --> 27:01.891
(rings)

27:01.891 --> 27:03.993
WEDECK.

27:03.993 --> 27:07.056
IT'S JANIS, SIR. I'VE GOT HIM.
GOOD. NOW YOU GET
THAT SQUIRRELLY S.O.B.

27:07.056 --> 27:10.760
BACK HERE ASAP.
ACTUALLY, I'D LIKE
TO TAKE A BEAT ON THAT.

27:10.760 --> 27:14.103
I'm listening.
WELL, HE SAYS HE'S HERE
BECAUSE OF HIS SISTER,

27:14.103 --> 27:17.767
BUT I THINK THERE'S
MORE TO IT THAN THAT.

27:17.767 --> 27:21.010
THIS IS JUST A HUNCH, BUT CAN I
TAKE 24 HOURS TO PLAY IT OUT?

27:21.010 --> 27:23.673
I'LL GIVE YOU THE NIGHT,
BUT YOU MAKE DAMN SURE

27:23.673 --> 27:26.015
you put a leash on that dog.
Do you hear me?

27:26.015 --> 27:28.978
Yes.
GOOD.

27:28.978 --> 27:31.080
(beeping steadily)

27:31.080 --> 27:33.082
IT'S TOO TIGHT.
OH, BOOHOO.

27:33.082 --> 27:37.186
IT'S UNCOMFORTABLE.
YEAH, GO FURTHER
THAN 100 FEET FROM ME,

27:37.186 --> 27:39.759
AND I'LL SHOW YOU
UNCOMFORTABLE.
(rapid beeps)

27:39.759 --> 27:43.032
OKAY, HURRY UP. PUT YOUR CLOTHES
ON BEFORE I CHANGE MY MIND.

27:43.032 --> 27:45.134
YOU POLICE TYPES--ALL ABOUT
POWER AND INTIMIDATION.

27:45.134 --> 27:47.366
I COULD HAVE DONE THIS WITH
MY TROUSERS ON, YOU KNOW.

27:47.366 --> 27:49.999
YEAH, WELL, MY INTENT WAS
TO DESTABILIZE...

27:49.999 --> 27:52.041
IN THE PHYSIC SENSE.

27:53.102 --> 27:56.075
HURRY UP.

27:56.075 --> 27:58.307
(doorbell rings)

27:58.307 --> 28:00.309
BABY! OH, MY GOD!
HEY.

28:00.309 --> 28:02.952
WHAT'S NEW?
OH, I'M OKAY. I'M OKAY.

28:02.952 --> 28:06.115
YOU LOOK AWFUL.
YES, I'M ALL RIGHT.
MOM, THIS IS MY FRIEND JANIS.

28:06.115 --> 28:10.059
HELLO.
JANIS, THESE ARE MY BROTHERS--
GRAHAM, ADAM. WHAT'S HAPPENING?

28:10.059 --> 28:13.222
YOU ALL RIGHT, MAN?
YEAH, I'M GOOD.
GOOD TO SEE YOU.

28:13.222 --> 28:15.825
ALL RIGHT, MOVIE STAR.
YOU SHOULD SEE THE OTHER GUY.

28:15.825 --> 28:19.098
I WAS SO PROUD TO LEARN
THAT SIMON HAD JOINED THE FBI.

28:19.098 --> 28:21.901
I EXPECT HE'S BEEN
VERY HELPFUL.
(Janis) YEAH,
HE'S BEEN VERY HELPFUL.

28:21.901 --> 28:23.072
(telephone rings)

28:23.072 --> 28:24.974
HELLO?

28:24.974 --> 28:29.809
NOT NOW. REPORTERS--
STILL CALLING EVERY DAY.

28:29.809 --> 28:32.111
THEY CAMPED OUT ON THE LAWN
AFTER THE PRESS CONFERENCE.

28:32.111 --> 28:36.415
MY SIMON--SUCH A CELEBRITY.
SO ARE YOU HIS SECRETARY?

28:36.415 --> 28:39.248
(chuckles) NO.

28:39.248 --> 28:41.390
MORE OF, UH,
AN ASSOCIATE, MOM.

28:41.390 --> 28:45.154
AFTER THEIR FATHER DIED,
ANNABELLE WAS IN SHOCK.

28:45.154 --> 28:47.827
A FEW DAYS LATER,
THE BLACKOUT HIT.

28:47.827 --> 28:51.500
SHE LEFT A NOTE--
"TOO MUCH SADNESS AT HOME"

28:51.500 --> 28:53.863
DROVE HER AWAY...

28:53.863 --> 28:56.035
(voice breaking)
I DROVE HER AWAY.

28:56.035 --> 28:58.067
THAT'S NOT TRUE.

28:58.067 --> 29:00.209
DON'T BE SO MAGNILOQUENT.
(normal voice)
I DON'T UNDERSTAND

29:00.209 --> 29:02.972
HALF OF WHAT HE SAYS,
BUT HE IS A LOVE--

29:02.972 --> 29:04.944
ALWAYS LOOKED OUT
FOR HIS BABY SISTER,

29:04.944 --> 29:07.847
COMES HOME EVERY MONTH
TO HELP US LOOK FOR HER.

29:07.847 --> 29:10.219
WERE YOU CLOSE?

29:10.219 --> 29:12.351
YEAH.

29:12.351 --> 29:14.023
SHE'S ONLY 15.

29:14.023 --> 29:17.226
I'M GONNA HAVE A QUICK SHOWER
BEFORE WE HEAD OUT.

29:21.891 --> 29:23.762
(faucet squeaks)

29:33.342 --> 29:35.204
(Janis) COOL ROCKS.

29:35.204 --> 29:37.206
THERE'S A STORY BEHIND THEM.

29:37.206 --> 29:40.109
HE HAD A HARD TIME
WHEN WE FIRST MOVED HERE.

29:40.109 --> 29:43.052
HE WAS SMALL FOR HIS AGE,
AND THE NEIGHBORHOOD BOYS

29:43.052 --> 29:45.214
USED TO PICK ON HIM
BECAUSE OF HIS ACCENT.

29:45.214 --> 29:48.087
WELL, HE WAS OLDER.
HE NEVER LOST IT.

29:48.087 --> 29:51.160
AND ONE DAY, THEY CORNERED HIM
IN THE ALLEY

29:51.160 --> 29:54.023
AND BEAT HIM UP BAD. THE HEAD
BULLY WENT TO SUNDAY SCHOOL

29:54.023 --> 29:57.026
'ROUND THE CORNER. SIMON MARCHED
RIGHT INTO THE CHURCH

29:57.026 --> 29:59.028
AND SMASHED THE BACK
OF THE KID'S HEAD

29:59.028 --> 30:02.331
WITH A SUPERMAN LUNCH BOX.
HE'D FILLED IT WITH THEM ROCKS,

30:02.331 --> 30:04.333
KNOCKED THE BULLY OUT COLD.

30:04.333 --> 30:07.376
THOSE BOYS NEVER
BOTHERED HIM AGAIN.
YEAH, I'LL BET THEY DIDN'T.

30:07.376 --> 30:10.139
SIMON'S ALWAYS BEEN A BIT
OF AN ALIEN IN THIS FAMILY--

30:10.139 --> 30:12.842
SMARTER THAN ALL OF US,
DIFFERENT.

30:12.842 --> 30:15.044
BUT THERE'S ONE THING
HE GETS FROM ME--

30:15.044 --> 30:18.047
ONE TRAIT THAT TELLS ME
HE'S DEFINITELY MY SON...

30:18.047 --> 30:20.189
(rapid beeping)

30:20.189 --> 30:23.052
(dishes clatter)

30:23.052 --> 30:24.493
DAMN IT.
(beep)

30:24.493 --> 30:28.297
THAT BOY NEVER LETS ANYONE
PUSH HIM AROUND.

30:28.297 --> 30:30.829
HE ALWAYS GETS EVEN.

30:30.829 --> 30:33.832
(shower running)

30:35.404 --> 30:37.907
(seagulls squawking)

30:48.978 --> 30:50.980
PHILLIP?

30:50.980 --> 30:53.122
IT'S ME, SIMON.

30:53.122 --> 30:55.384
I KNOW YOU'RE THERE.

30:55.384 --> 30:58.357
I BROUGHT SOME SARDINES
FOR SAMANTHA

30:58.357 --> 31:00.990
FROM THAT FISH MARKET
SHE LIKES.

31:03.062 --> 31:06.135
I ALSO HAVE
A FIRST-PRESS 78

31:06.135 --> 31:09.138
OF "DARK WAS THE NIGHT,
COLD WAS THE GROUND."

31:09.138 --> 31:12.041
IT'S BLIND WILLIE JOHNSON,
PHILLIP.

31:17.046 --> 31:20.409
(locks click)

31:20.409 --> 31:22.451
SIMON CAMPOS.

31:22.451 --> 31:25.114
WHERE THE HELL DID YOU FIND
A FIRST-PRESS 78?

31:25.114 --> 31:27.486
HEY? (chuckles)

31:34.093 --> 31:37.396
(Blind Willie Johnson)
â™ª AH â™ª

31:37.396 --> 31:39.999
YOU KNOW, THIS SONG
WAS, UH, SENT INTO SPACE

31:39.999 --> 31:42.001
ON THE "VOYAGER" SPACECRAFT?

31:42.001 --> 31:44.934
IF EXTRATERRESTRIALS EVER
ACTUALLY LISTEN TO IT,

31:44.934 --> 31:47.306
THEY'RE GONNA THINK
WE'RE A LOT COOLER

31:47.306 --> 31:49.208
THAN WE REALLY ARE.

31:49.208 --> 31:52.141
WHY ARE YOU HERE, SIMON?

31:52.141 --> 31:54.213
â™ª AH, OH, OOH â™ª

31:54.213 --> 31:56.615
â™ª MM â™ª

31:56.615 --> 32:00.149
I SEE THE WELSH ARCHERS
HAVE MOVED

32:00.149 --> 32:04.153
INTO THEIR FLANKING POSITION.
HAS HENRY MADE HIS SPEECH YET?

32:04.153 --> 32:06.095
(chuckles) OH, YEAH.

32:06.095 --> 32:09.198
"THIS STORY THE GOOD MAN
SHALL TEACH HIS SON,

32:09.198 --> 32:13.062
"AND CRISPIN CRISPIAN
SHALL NE'ER GO BY

32:13.062 --> 32:16.165
"FROM THIS DAY
TO THE ENDING OF THE WORLD.

32:16.165 --> 32:21.010
BUT WE IN IT--
WE FEW, WE HAPPY FEW..."
"WE FEW, WE HAPPY FEW,
WE BAND--"

32:21.010 --> 32:24.373
"WE BAND OF BROTHERS."

32:24.373 --> 32:27.446
WHAT? I LIKE SHAKESPEARE.

32:38.157 --> 32:40.159
SERIOUSLY,
DID YOU HONESTLY THINK

32:40.159 --> 32:43.162
THE FBI WASN'T GONNA CHECK
YOUR CELL PHONE RECORDS?

32:43.162 --> 32:46.065
SO WHAT'S IT BEEN--LIKE,
TEN CALLS HE'S MADE TO YOU

32:46.065 --> 32:48.637
IN THE PAST COUPLE OF WEEKS?
GIVE OR TAKE.

32:48.637 --> 32:51.540
WELL, WHATEVER IT IS
YOU HAVE TO SAY,

32:51.540 --> 32:54.543
IT'S GOTTA BE IMPORTANT ENOUGH
FOR YOU TO LIE, MANIPULATE

32:54.543 --> 32:58.647
AND EVADE THE FBI,
SO PLEASE... CONTINUE.
THAT WAS QUITE
A PRESS CONFERENCE, HUH?

32:58.647 --> 33:02.111
MIGHT HAVE SET PARTICLE PHYSICS
RESEARCH BACK A HUNDRED YEARS.

33:02.111 --> 33:04.253
PHILLIP,
YOU ARE THE ONLY PROFESSOR

33:04.253 --> 33:07.586
I HAVE EVER HAD WHO I KNOW
IS SMARTER THAN I AM.

33:07.586 --> 33:11.090
DO YOU THINK
A PARTICLE ACCELERATOR

33:11.090 --> 33:14.063
COULD HAVE GENERATED SOME SORT
OF... DECOHERENCE WAVE?

33:14.063 --> 33:16.065
WELL, IF YOUR EXPERIMENTS
AT N.L.A.P.

33:16.065 --> 33:19.028
UNLEASHED A TACHYON BURST,
THEN YES,

33:19.028 --> 33:22.471
WITHOUT A DOUBT, IT COULD HAVE
CAUSED HUMAN CONSCIOUSNESS

33:22.471 --> 33:25.474
TO FLASH FORWARD IN TIME
AS THE WAVE MOVED THROUGH.

33:25.474 --> 33:28.177
SO TELL ME,
HOW WOULD WE BUILD SOMETHING

33:28.177 --> 33:31.540
TO KEEP US
IN THE HERE AND NOW?
IT'S IMPOSSIBLE.

33:31.540 --> 33:33.542
NO, IT'S GOT TO BE POSSIBLE.

33:33.542 --> 33:37.116
WE HAVE TO ANCHOR CONSCIOUSNESS
IF ANOTHER WAVE HAPPENS.

33:37.116 --> 33:40.049
IT'S SIMPLY A MATTER
OF FINDING A WAY.
SIMON--

33:40.049 --> 33:42.291
WE HAVE TO PROTECT OURSELVES
FROM THE EFFECTS

33:42.291 --> 33:45.294
OF ANOTHER BLACKOUT.
NOW THERE IS NOTHING I CAN DO

33:45.294 --> 33:46.795
ABOUT THE 20 MILLION
WHO DIED ON OCTOBER 6th.

33:46.795 --> 33:50.699
PLEASE HELP ME SAVE
THE MILLIONS WHO WILL DIE

33:50.699 --> 33:52.601
IF THIS HAPPENS AGAIN.

33:54.533 --> 33:57.636
SO IN PLAIN ENGLISH,

33:57.636 --> 34:00.309
WHAT EXACTLY WERE
YOU TWO TALKING ABOUT?

34:00.309 --> 34:03.642
THE DESIGN THAT I CREATED
THAT SHOWED UP IN SOMALIA--

34:03.642 --> 34:05.644
PHILLIP WAS MY ADVISOR ON IT.

34:05.644 --> 34:08.777
HE MENTORED ME ALL THROUGH
MY PhD. THE MAN'S A GENIUS.

34:08.777 --> 34:11.620
I NEED ANSWERS.
LET'S JUST SAY THE FBI

34:11.620 --> 34:15.284
DOESN'T WORK AT THE SPEED
I'M ACCUSTOMED TO.

34:15.284 --> 34:17.786
SOME MIGHT SAY THAT SPEAKS
TO CONTROL ISSUES.

34:17.786 --> 34:19.488
SOME MIGHT, YEAH.

34:19.488 --> 34:22.431
MY THERAPIST SAYS CONTROL ISSUES
ARE ROOTED IN FEAR.

34:25.234 --> 34:27.736
YOUR THERAPIST IS RIGHT.

34:27.736 --> 34:30.169
THIS IS A GRAY AREA,

34:30.169 --> 34:32.241
AND IT TERRIFIES ME.

34:37.146 --> 34:39.708
THIS IS NICE.

34:39.708 --> 34:44.183
I EAT A LOT OF TAKEOUT
AT MY DESK... ALONE.

34:44.183 --> 34:47.186
OH, THAT'S SAD, LOVE--
PRETTY GIRL LIKE YOU.

34:47.186 --> 34:49.087
NO BOYFRIEND, NO KIDS?

34:49.087 --> 34:52.121
I'LL GET THAT, MOM.
OH, THANKS, LOVE.

34:52.121 --> 34:54.123
GOTTA WATCH THAT BACK.
(grunts)

34:54.123 --> 34:56.795
THANK YOU.
YOU'RE WELCOME.

34:56.795 --> 34:58.797
(kisses)

35:00.299 --> 35:03.602
I DON'T CARE ABOUT
ANY BIG SCIENCE JOB

35:03.602 --> 35:06.175
OR THE FACT THAT
HE'S ALL OVER THE TV.

35:06.175 --> 35:08.407
HE'S STILL MY BABY,
YOU KNOW?

35:08.407 --> 35:12.110
I REMEMBER KISSING HIS SCRAPED
KNEES LIKE IT WERE YESTERDAY.

35:12.110 --> 35:13.882
(doorbell rings)

35:13.882 --> 35:15.814
MOTHERHOOD'S CRAZY LIKE THAT.

35:15.814 --> 35:18.247
(doorbell rings)

35:18.247 --> 35:20.749
SIMON,
BE A DEAR AND GET THAT.

35:20.749 --> 35:23.692
(lowers voice) IT'S A SURPRISE--
THEIR UNCLE TEDDY.

35:28.727 --> 35:30.399
UNCLE TEDDY.

35:33.602 --> 35:37.466
SIMON, WHEN I HEARD YOU WERE
KIDNAPPED, I WAS SO WORRIED.

35:39.808 --> 35:42.541
THANK GOD YOU'RE OKAY.

35:46.475 --> 35:49.648
IT'S A WONDERFUL CÃ´TES DU RHÃ´NE
FROM SAINT-GERVAIS.

35:49.648 --> 35:52.381
TEDDY'S ALWAYS BRINGING US
EXOTIC WINES BACK

35:52.381 --> 35:53.882
FROM HIS TRAVELS.

35:53.882 --> 35:57.326
EASY NOW. THERE ARE ONLY 15
MORE BOTTLES ON THE PLANET.

35:57.326 --> 36:01.290
I'M SELF-MEDICATIN'.
(wine pours)

36:01.290 --> 36:05.163
UM, SO ARE YOU TWO
BROTHER AND SISTER?

36:05.163 --> 36:08.197
TECHNICALLY,
I'M A VERY DISTANT COUSIN.

36:08.197 --> 36:10.699
TEDDY'S THE REASON
WE MOVED TO CANADA. MM-HMM.
REALLY?

36:10.699 --> 36:12.701
ACTUALLY, SIMON'S THE REASON.

36:12.701 --> 36:15.204
KID'S I.Q. SCORES
WERE OFF THE CHARTS,

36:15.204 --> 36:17.946
YET HE WAS FAILING
ALL HIS CLASSES--

36:17.946 --> 36:20.349
BORED, OBVIOUSLY.

36:20.349 --> 36:23.181
WE WANTED TO MAKE SURE
HIS EXCEPTIONAL POTENTIAL

36:23.181 --> 36:25.554
DIDN'T GO TO WASTE.

36:25.554 --> 36:27.616
HE STARTED
THE UNIVERSITY OF TORONTO

36:27.616 --> 36:29.187
WHEN HE WAS ONLY 13.

36:29.187 --> 36:31.520
AND THAT WAS FOLLOWED BY
THE YOUTH PHYSICS FELLOWSHIP,

36:31.520 --> 36:35.764
THE PhD,
THE POST-OP AT N.L.A.P.--

36:35.764 --> 36:38.327
POST-DOC, NOT POST-OP.
CAN WE DISPENSE WITH

36:38.327 --> 36:43.672
THE "THIS IS YOUR LIFE"
EPISODE, PLEASE?
YOU KNOW, I NEVER TOOK TIME OUT
TO HAVE KIDS OF MY OWN.

36:43.672 --> 36:46.635
THEY'RE SUCH BLESSINGS.
DO YOU REGRET IT?

36:46.635 --> 36:48.707
NAH. I'VE GOT THESE GUYS.

36:48.707 --> 36:51.780
I COULD NEVER REPAY
WHAT THEY'VE GIVEN ME--

36:51.780 --> 36:55.484
SCHOOL PLAYS, HOCKEY GAMES,
BIRTHDAY PARTIES--

36:55.484 --> 36:56.885
SHUT UP.

36:56.885 --> 36:59.548
(Simon's mother) SIMON.

36:59.548 --> 37:01.790
EVERYTHING I'VE LEARNED
ABOUT FAMILY

37:01.790 --> 37:05.223
I'VE LEARNED AT THIS TABLE.
PAY NO ATTENTION.
THIS IS ALL A CHARADE.

37:05.223 --> 37:08.897
WHAT IS YOUR PROBLEM?
IT'S ALL RIGHT.
RED WINE MAKES HIM MEAN.

37:08.897 --> 37:12.801
HIS FATHER WAS LIKE THAT,
TOO.
HOW DARE YOU BRING HIM UP?

37:12.801 --> 37:15.534
YOU HAVE NO RIGHT.

37:15.534 --> 37:19.868
YOU WERE BROUGHT HERE
TO WITNESS AN EXPERIMENT

37:19.868 --> 37:22.571
THAT WILL CHANGE HUMANITY
FOR ALL TIME--

37:22.571 --> 37:26.545
AN EXPERIMENT THAT COULD NOT
HAVE BEEN CONDUCTED WITHOUT YOU.

37:26.545 --> 37:29.978
THE ONLY THING I'VE WORKED ON
IN THE PAST YEAR HAS BEEN--
AT N.L.A.P.

37:29.978 --> 37:31.980
THE EXPERIMENT
THAT OCCURRED

37:31.980 --> 37:34.983
EXACTLY 1 MINUTE
AND 47 SECONDS AGO.

37:34.983 --> 37:38.887
WHAT HAVE YOU DONE?
PROBABLY KILLED
MILLIONS OF PEOPLE.

37:38.887 --> 37:41.790
WE EXPECT BACKLASH
AGAINST THOSE

37:41.790 --> 37:43.962
ULTIMATELY FOUND RESPONSIBLE.

37:43.962 --> 37:47.366
WHAT A COINCIDENCE
THAT YOUR FATHER PASSED AWAY

37:47.366 --> 37:49.868
JUST WHEN WE NEEDED
TO CREATE AN ALIBI FOR YOU.

37:49.868 --> 37:53.902
SOME KIND OF HUNTING ACCIDENT,
WASN'T IT?

37:53.902 --> 37:57.776
A PRIVATE PLANE WILL TAKE YOU
BACK TO TORONTO NOW.

37:57.776 --> 38:00.479
THE F.A.A. WILL NOT HAVE
A RECORD OF THE FLIGHT.

38:00.479 --> 38:04.282
ONE MORE THING. WHEN PEOPLE
ASK YOU WHAT YOU SAW

38:04.282 --> 38:07.386
IN YOUR FLASH-FORWARD,
MAKE UP A STORY AND STICK TO IT.

38:07.386 --> 38:10.459
(indistinct shouting
in distance)
HEAR THAT?

38:12.290 --> 38:16.665
THAT IS THE SOUND OF
THE WHOLE WORLD WAKING UP.

38:16.665 --> 38:20.068
(sirens wailing)

38:20.068 --> 38:24.503
MR. FLOSSO HAS A PLAN FOR
EVERY THOUGHT YOU'RE THINKING.

38:24.503 --> 38:26.505
A HUNTING ACCIDENT.

38:26.505 --> 38:28.507
YOU GOTTA BE CAREFUL
WITH THOSE SHOTGUNS.

38:28.507 --> 38:31.610
HANDLE THEM WRONG AND KABOOM--
YOU KILLED HIM.

38:31.610 --> 38:33.612
YOU KILLED MY FATHER.

38:36.845 --> 38:39.388
(grunts)

38:39.388 --> 38:42.551
(grunting and gasping)

39:01.009 --> 39:03.041
NOW I GOT MY KILLER STORY.

39:04.913 --> 39:07.075
(telephone rings)

39:08.947 --> 39:11.019
HELLO?

39:11.019 --> 39:13.922
OH, MY GOD. COME QUICK!
IT'S YOUR SISTER ANNABELLE!

39:13.922 --> 39:16.455
NO WAY.
WHERE IS SHE?

39:16.455 --> 39:20.028
SIMON, THAT CALL--
IT'S NOT FOR YOU.

39:20.028 --> 39:22.791
THIS IS FBI AGENT JANIS HAWK,
BADGE NUMBER 3-0-9-8-1-7.

39:22.791 --> 39:25.464
I NEED TO TRACE A CALL.
(whispers) QUICK!

39:25.464 --> 39:27.996
(Annabelle)
Everyone, hi, I'm okay.
WHERE ARE YOU, BABY?

39:27.996 --> 39:29.998
I'm in New York
at Port Authority.

39:34.843 --> 39:38.006
I have a bus ticket.

39:38.006 --> 39:41.880
(crying)
I want to come home.

39:44.613 --> 39:48.517
I want to come home.

39:48.517 --> 39:51.059
I love you.

39:51.059 --> 39:53.862
(lowers voice)
WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS?

39:53.862 --> 39:56.865
(lowers voice) YOU'VE BEEN
ACCEPTING OUR HELP FOR 20 YEARS.

39:56.865 --> 40:00.529
SURELY YOU DIDN'T THINK
THAT IT CAME WITHOUT A PRICE.
YOU ASKED ME TO GIVE YOU DATA,

40:00.529 --> 40:03.532
TO TELL YOU WHEN WE WERE RUNNING
THE EXPERIMENT. THAT'S ALL.

40:03.532 --> 40:06.174
KILLING MY FATHER,
TAKING ANNABELLE--

40:06.174 --> 40:10.839
THAT WAS NEVER PART
OF THE DEAL.
THE DEAL IS WHATEVER
WE SAY IT IS, AND RIGHT NOW

40:10.839 --> 40:13.542
WE NEED YOU TO COOPERATE.
ANNABELLE IS JUST INSURANCE.

40:13.542 --> 40:15.884
LET'S GO FOR A LITTLE WALK,
SHALL WE?

40:20.088 --> 40:22.751
IT WAS THE RING THAT
KEPT ME AWAKE, WASN'T IT?

40:22.751 --> 40:25.454
SOME SORT OF
QUANTUM ENTANGLEMENT DEVICE.

40:25.454 --> 40:27.956
WHAT DO I KNOW?
I'M JUST A MIDDLEMAN.

40:27.956 --> 40:29.958
I THINK YOU DO KNOW.

40:29.958 --> 40:32.631
WHAT I'M STILL TRYING
TO WORK OUT IS WHY YOU WOULD

40:32.631 --> 40:34.633
CAUSE A BLACKOUT
IN THE FIRST PLACE.
IT DOESN'T MATTER.

40:34.633 --> 40:37.966
WHAT DOES IS THAT YOU CONTINUE
DOING WHAT YOU'RE TOLD.

40:37.966 --> 40:40.709
AND DON'T THINK
YOUR PROFESSOR CAN HELP.

40:40.709 --> 40:42.471
(car alarm chirps)

40:42.471 --> 40:44.473
(whirring)

40:52.020 --> 40:54.523
YOU KILLED HIM.

40:54.523 --> 40:56.585
THIS IS YOUR LAST WARNING.

40:56.585 --> 40:59.788
CROSS US AGAIN AND WE'LL START
SHIPPING ANNABELLE BACK TO YOU

40:59.788 --> 41:01.890
PIECE BY PIECE.

41:03.962 --> 41:05.964
NO.

41:07.936 --> 41:10.038
I'M CALLING YOUR BLUFF.

41:10.038 --> 41:12.801
YOU NEED ME.

41:12.801 --> 41:16.605
OTHERWISE I WOULDN'T
BE ALIVE RIGHT NOW.

41:16.605 --> 41:19.107
(grunts)

41:19.107 --> 41:20.609
(gasps)

41:20.609 --> 41:23.181
I WANT TO TALK TO THE PEOPLE
PULLING THE STRINGS.

41:23.181 --> 41:26.084
THAT'S NOT GONNA HAPPEN.
SEE, I THINK IT WILL,

41:26.084 --> 41:28.957
'CAUSE I'M SENDING THEM
A MESSAGE,

41:28.957 --> 41:31.259
AND THE MESSAGE... IS YOU.
(coughing)

41:31.259 --> 41:35.794
(wheezing) YOU HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT YOU'RE DOING!

41:35.794 --> 41:37.526
(whispering) SURE I DO.

41:37.526 --> 41:39.598
I'M CUTTING OUT
THE MIDDLEMAN.

41:39.598 --> 41:41.770
(coughing and gasping)

41:41.770 --> 41:44.002
TOO BAD
ABOUT YOUR EMPHYSEMA.

41:44.002 --> 41:47.275
IT'S GONNA MAKE THIS
OH, SO EASY.

41:47.275 --> 41:50.709
YOUR CARDIAC OUTPUT
IS STARVING

41:50.709 --> 41:55.784
YOUR HEART AND BRAIN
OF VALUABLE OXYGEN.

41:55.784 --> 41:59.047
FINALLY...

41:59.047 --> 42:03.091
CARDIAC ARREST.

42:03.091 --> 42:05.594
THE BRUISES ON YOUR CHEST

42:05.594 --> 42:09.527
JUST MY FUTILE ATTEMPT
AT C.P.R.

42:09.527 --> 42:13.832
(thunder rumbling)

42:17.235 --> 42:20.208
THIS IS FOR MY FATHER,

42:20.208 --> 42:22.611
YOU PATHETIC SON OF A BITCH.

42:25.043 --> 42:26.915
I NEVER GET PUSHED AROUND.

42:28.677 --> 42:31.720
AND I ALWAYS GET EVEN.

42:31.720 --> 42:34.683
(thunder crashes)
