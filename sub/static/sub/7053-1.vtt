<i>FBI Agent Olivia Dunham...</i>

00:04.287 --> 00:07.123
<i>Peter Bishop.
His father, Dr. Walter Bishop...</i>

00:07.483 --> 00:09.579
<i>They're investigating
strange cases.</i>

00:09.614 --> 00:12.136
<i>Which have led them
to Walter's former lab partner,</i>

00:12.137 --> 00:13.684
<i>Dr. William Bell.</i>

00:13.719 --> 00:15.010
We have evidence
that William Bell

00:15.045 --> 00:17.403
may be involved
with several biological attacks.

00:17.404 --> 00:19.587
<i>The search for Bell
has taken them to places</i>

00:19.622 --> 00:21.133
<i>beyond the impossible.</i>

00:21.168 --> 00:23.275
I will turn this world over
looking for him.

00:23.310 --> 00:25.590
William Bell is not
in this world.

00:25.625 --> 00:28.311
I've been waiting
quite a long time for this.

<i>- Hello?
- Hello?</i>

01:24.377 --> 01:26.745
<i>'scuse me.</i>

01:26.746 --> 01:29.715
Are you--
are you okay?

02:58.911 --> 03:00.290
<i>It's car v. car.</i>

03:00.389 --> 03:02.536
NYPD's taking
witness statements now.

03:02.909 --> 03:05.045
What the hell
happened to the drivers?

03:05.080 --> 03:06.521
Hey, you caught
the case.

03:07.514 --> 03:10.816
So who's our man?
Who was driving this vehicle?

03:22.595 --> 03:23.663
<i>Walter, come on.</i>

03:23.698 --> 03:25.130
<i>I don't need you
to make me anything.</i>

03:25.131 --> 03:26.290
I insist.

03:26.399 --> 03:28.667
You know, there's something
you don't know about me, son.

03:28.668 --> 03:29.352
What's that?

03:29.474 --> 03:31.603
That once you enter a grocery store,
you never leave again?

03:31.604 --> 03:32.250
Ever?

03:33.173 --> 03:35.974
No. Before I became chair
of biochemistry at Harvard,

03:35.975 --> 03:38.477
which was after
Oxford and M.I.T.,

03:38.478 --> 03:42.968
I was sous chef at
the Bakersfield food lab.

03:43.550 --> 03:44.716
- Sous chef.
- Uh-huh.

03:44.717 --> 03:48.948
Well, technically I worked
under Seymour Brodien.

03:49.989 --> 03:51.968
Am I supposed to know
who that is?

03:52.458 --> 03:54.474
He invented
the ho-ho.

03:54.727 --> 03:56.962
Of course he did.

03:56.963 --> 03:59.965
Walter, I want
to leave this place.

03:59.966 --> 04:01.731
And I don't need you
to make me a cake.

04:01.766 --> 04:03.435
I'm not making you a cake,
I'm making you a custard.

04:03.436 --> 04:04.436
It's my specialty.

04:04.437 --> 04:05.739
I don't like custard.

04:05.774 --> 04:07.513
In fact, I've never
liked custard.

04:08.474 --> 04:10.642
As a boy, you loved it.

04:10.643 --> 04:12.144
You've just forgotten.

04:12.145 --> 04:14.813
Friday is your birthday.

04:14.814 --> 04:16.685
You deserve
something wonderful.

04:16.882 --> 04:18.884
Well, for my birthday,

04:18.885 --> 04:20.319
can I have getting the hell
out of here?

04:20.320 --> 04:21.786
We need
to celebrate

04:21.788 --> 04:24.151
and make sure that
Agent Dunham can attend.

04:24.657 --> 04:27.028
I want to see her face
when she eats my pudding.

04:28.294 --> 04:29.595
That's disturbing.

04:29.596 --> 04:31.396
Peter Bishop.

04:34.467 --> 04:35.834
What?

04:41.741 --> 04:42.908
- Mr. Bishop?
- Yeah.

04:42.909 --> 04:43.976
- Agent Jessup. Hi.
- Hi.

04:43.977 --> 04:45.667
- This is my father Walter.
- Yes.

04:45.702 --> 04:47.090
I have a couple
questions for you.

04:47.125 --> 04:48.736
- How bad is she?
- We don't know.

04:48.737 --> 04:49.937
Excuse me?

04:49.938 --> 04:50.834
<i>How do you not know?</i>

04:50.944 --> 04:52.811
<i>Can you just explain</i>
<i>exactly what you do?</i>

04:52.842 --> 04:54.775
You're some sort
of special consultant?

04:54.776 --> 04:56.911
- Where's Charlie?
- I'm sorry, Charlie who?

04:56.912 --> 04:58.224
<i>Agent Charlie Francis.</i>
<i>Where is he?</i>

04:58.254 --> 04:59.714
<i>I believe he's</i>
<i>en route from Quantico.</i>

04:59.715 --> 05:00.588
I'm the agent
in charge.

05:00.639 --> 05:02.745
Well, agent in charge,
where is Olivia Dunham?

05:02.751 --> 05:05.320
<i>Witnesses report that</i>
<i>after the crash, a man was seen</i>

05:05.355 --> 05:08.589
leaving the car on foot, but
no one saw anyone leave the SUV.

05:08.590 --> 05:10.791
<i>The doors are still locked,</i>
<i>the seatbelt still buckled,</i>

05:10.792 --> 05:11.966
<i>the airbags deployed,</i>

05:12.016 --> 05:14.512
but there's no indentation
which implies

05:14.547 --> 05:16.413
<i>no one was behind the wheel</i>
<i>at the moment of impact.</i>

05:16.414 --> 05:17.481
Did you check
to make sure

05:17.482 --> 05:18.716
these skid marks
match the other vehicle?

05:18.717 --> 05:20.608
Look, you still haven't
told me what it is you do.

05:20.643 --> 05:22.382
You, Agent Dunham,
your father.

05:22.417 --> 05:23.232
I checked with
the field office,

05:23.267 --> 05:24.466
they said that
all of your work is--

05:24.501 --> 05:26.966
Classified, and that
you don't have access.

05:27.001 --> 05:28.488
I don't have
time for this.

05:28.489 --> 05:29.251
<i>It's not that</i>
<i>I don't appreciate</i>

05:29.290 --> 05:31.558
<i>petulance, Mr. Bishop,</i>

05:31.559 --> 05:32.365
<i>But the sooner</i>
<i>you cooperate--</i>

05:32.415 --> 05:33.874
I would love to cooperate
as soon as you can

05:33.904 --> 05:35.721
find me an agent
who can actually help me.

05:57.007 --> 05:59.827
"A New Day in the Old Town"

07:25.562 --> 07:27.187
Walter.

07:30.579 --> 07:33.260
I'm afraid your friend's
injuries were too severe.

07:33.936 --> 07:34.777
Oh, come on.

07:34.846 --> 07:37.181
We were unable to restore
any brain function.

07:37.713 --> 07:39.548
Patients who suffer
this kind of head trauma

07:39.618 --> 07:42.458
simply don't regain
consciousness.

07:43.511 --> 07:46.722
Simple.
Reductive. Absurd.

07:50.347 --> 07:52.694
Life and death,
these are relative terms.

07:52.949 --> 07:58.409
Contextually defined, dependent
on cultural specifics.

07:58.444 --> 07:58.887
Walter--

07:58.936 --> 08:02.268
He is undoubtedly indulging
in primitive diagnostics.

08:02.292 --> 08:03.559
Agent Dunham
is not dead.

08:04.654 --> 08:07.241
She's not dead.
She's not dead.

08:07.263 --> 08:08.594
- Walter--
- She's not.

08:09.197 --> 08:09.923
Walter!

08:10.467 --> 08:11.968
Walter, wait, stop.

08:12.003 --> 08:13.337
- <i>You can't go back there.</i>
- Doctor, please...

08:13.561 --> 08:15.169
Back off.

08:45.115 --> 08:47.321
I'm so sorry, Olivia.

09:19.436 --> 09:20.504
Mind if I join you?

09:32.615 --> 09:34.422
I'm guessing
you don't drink.

09:35.885 --> 09:36.744
Double.

09:41.991 --> 09:43.848
How did you find me?

09:43.883 --> 09:45.492
I work for the F.B.I.

09:49.532 --> 09:50.437
Where's your father?

09:53.837 --> 09:56.448
My father is off
in la-la land.

09:57.807 --> 10:00.542
Mixed himself up
a really nice cocktail

10:00.543 --> 10:03.824
of Valium, Haldol, Seconal,
and I think Lorazepam.

10:05.181 --> 10:07.505
Astrid is baby-sitting.

10:09.185 --> 10:11.661
I've been called
to Washington tomorrow.

10:13.022 --> 10:15.685
The efficacy of the division
is being questioned.

10:16.292 --> 10:18.560
I've been informed that
our failure to deliver

10:18.561 --> 10:21.104
any useable results
is unacceptable.

10:24.000 --> 10:25.780
They're shutting
you down?

10:37.380 --> 10:39.636
What were we even
doing, anyway?

10:40.984 --> 10:43.085
We'd sit around and wait
for somebody to die,

10:43.086 --> 10:44.987
some grisly,
macabre death,

10:44.988 --> 10:46.955
or for the entire fabric
of the Universe

10:46.956 --> 10:48.490
to come
shredding apart.

10:48.491 --> 10:50.259
We were
the clean-up crew,

10:50.260 --> 10:51.960
sent in to mop it up
and make sure it was

10:51.961 --> 10:53.986
all neat and tidy
for the file.

10:57.734 --> 10:59.234
We were always
too late anyway.

10:59.235 --> 11:01.436
That's not
entirely true.

11:03.306 --> 11:05.489
We were too late
for Olivia.

11:16.210 --> 11:17.315
To Agent Dunham.

11:22.202 --> 11:23.436
To Agent Dunham.

12:23.953 --> 12:25.404
Hey, Rach.

12:27.657 --> 12:29.079
When'd you get back?

12:29.325 --> 12:30.707
A few hours ago.

12:31.861 --> 12:32.807
Ella's at
a friend's house.

12:32.859 --> 12:35.369
You know, I didn't want her
to remember her aunt like this.

12:37.300 --> 12:40.716
She had a living will.
No life support.

12:44.341 --> 12:46.842
They're gonna do this in--
in the morning,

12:46.843 --> 12:48.865
so I've just been
sitting with her, and...

12:53.840 --> 12:55.673
Do you wanna...

12:59.437 --> 13:00.137
Yes.

13:03.931 --> 13:05.765
You know
she liked you, Peter.

13:07.040 --> 13:08.233
Did you know that?

13:54.010 --> 13:55.196
Hey.

14:17.934 --> 14:19.393
Good-bye, Olivia.

14:19.702 --> 14:23.028
<i>Einai kalytero anthropo</i>
<i>apo ton patera toy.</i>

14:27.182 --> 14:28.581
<i>Can you tell me</i>
<i>your name?</i>

14:28.582 --> 14:29.780
It's Olivia Dunham.

14:29.815 --> 14:30.798
Do you know the year?

14:30.847 --> 14:32.852
Why am I in a hospital,
and what is wrong with my leg?

14:32.853 --> 14:35.088
You were in an accident.
Do you remember?

14:35.089 --> 14:36.762
In New York.

14:38.392 --> 14:39.961
Is Peter here?
I need to see him.

14:39.996 --> 14:41.185
He's here, he's here.

14:43.097 --> 14:46.205
I-I went somewhere.

14:46.301 --> 14:47.704
I know, you went
to New York.

14:47.744 --> 14:49.936
No.
Yeah, but no.

14:49.937 --> 14:51.365
Olivia, look, you were
in an accident.

14:51.437 --> 14:54.808
No, no, I was trying
to get somewhere

14:54.809 --> 14:55.877
and someone was
trying to stop me,

14:55.912 --> 14:57.110
but I went there
anyway, and--

14:59.080 --> 15:00.280
Oh, God,
what is happening?

15:00.281 --> 15:02.660
<i>Mr. Bishop, please!</i>
<i>She needs to stay calm.</i>

15:04.238 --> 15:05.409
He told me something.

15:05.444 --> 15:06.894
- Who?
- I don't know. I can't remember.

15:06.973 --> 15:08.888
But, oh, it was
very important.

15:08.889 --> 15:10.356
There's something
that I have to do.

15:10.357 --> 15:12.025
Who, Olivia?
Who told you to do what?

15:12.026 --> 15:14.358
I don't know, but there's
something that I have to do,

15:14.393 --> 15:15.462
- and I--
- What?

15:15.463 --> 15:17.597
I think that our lives
may depend on it.

15:17.598 --> 15:19.524
Whose lives?

15:22.603 --> 15:23.577
Everyone's.

15:23.666 --> 15:25.238
That beta blocker.
Get her pulse down.

15:25.239 --> 15:28.599
No, Peter, I need my gun.
Please, I'm not safe.

15:28.634 --> 15:30.210
Somebody hurt me,
they did this to me.

15:30.211 --> 15:32.754
Please, Peter, my gun.
I need my gun.

15:34.715 --> 15:36.325
Please, Peter.

15:45.826 --> 15:47.167
'scuse me.

15:47.395 --> 15:49.163
I need to speak
with Special Agent Broyles.

15:49.198 --> 15:50.738
Agent Broyles
is in Washington.

15:50.773 --> 15:55.235
Uh, then Agent Francis, please.
Charlie Francis.

15:56.313 --> 15:57.504
Sir, what is
this regarding?

15:58.370 --> 15:59.906
Okay, I work
for you guys.

15:59.907 --> 16:01.341
I'm a consultant.

16:01.342 --> 16:02.776
I need access to a file
on a car accident

16:02.777 --> 16:04.116
yesterday in
New York City.

16:06.547 --> 16:08.782
I'm sorry, these credentials
have been revoked, Mr. Bishop.

16:08.783 --> 16:10.483
What?

16:10.484 --> 16:13.453
Look, lady,
you need to help me.

16:13.454 --> 16:16.189
Please feel free to file a
civilian request on our website.

16:16.190 --> 16:17.357
Web--
No, listen to me.

16:17.358 --> 16:19.025
One of your agents
is in the hospital,

16:19.026 --> 16:20.460
and her life--
and possibly yours--

16:20.461 --> 16:21.661
depends on the work
that I need to do,

16:21.662 --> 16:23.307
so you find me somebody
who can help me.

16:23.387 --> 16:25.183
Okay, sir, if you'd
exit the building--

16:30.137 --> 16:31.333
<i>I'll take him.</i>

16:38.345 --> 16:40.163
I'm with her.

16:43.651 --> 16:44.884
What're you
doing in Boston?

16:44.885 --> 16:46.052
You like to fight, Mr. Bishop?

16:46.053 --> 16:48.595
All that time in Iraq.
Mob connections.

16:48.789 --> 16:50.854
You've got quite
a combative history.

16:51.458 --> 16:52.725
Look, you said
you were gonna help me

16:52.726 --> 16:53.705
get my hands
on that file.

16:53.766 --> 16:54.994
It's on the seat
behind you.

16:55.651 --> 16:56.259
What?

16:56.329 --> 16:58.548
Something wasn't adding up
about those skid marks.

16:58.583 --> 17:00.600
<i>They were darkest at the back,</i>
<i>not the front.</i>

17:00.601 --> 17:03.427
So maximum torque farthest
away from the incident.

17:05.172 --> 17:06.873
That means the driver
wasn't slowing down.

17:06.874 --> 17:08.007
He was speeding up.

17:08.008 --> 17:09.498
Then he must've
been waiting.

17:09.743 --> 17:11.412
<i>Those are pictures</i>
<i>from the surveillance camera</i>

17:11.446 --> 17:13.839
in the parking structure
adjacent to the accident site.

17:14.029 --> 17:15.949
<i>George Reed.</i>
<i>524 Littlefield Road.</i>

17:15.983 --> 17:18.907
Here, in Lexington.
We're 15 minutes away.

17:19.501 --> 17:20.675
<i>All right,</i>
<i>now it's your turn.</i>

17:20.710 --> 17:22.036
What's
the Fringe Division?

17:22.569 --> 17:24.083
<i>What do you</i>
<i>people do?</i>

17:26.271 --> 17:27.013
Nothing.

17:28.840 --> 17:29.719
Not anymore.

17:32.769 --> 17:34.081
F.B.I.

17:34.082 --> 17:35.429
George Reed?

17:36.695 --> 17:37.749
Mr. Reed?

17:39.976 --> 17:41.022
Body.

17:42.097 --> 17:43.212
Look at his lividity.

17:44.993 --> 17:46.899
If this guy was driving
a car in New York,

17:46.934 --> 17:48.626
it wasn't yesterday.

17:50.660 --> 17:52.236
I need to get a ride
for someone.

17:52.701 --> 17:55.841
Feel his anus.
It's soaking wet.

17:56.972 --> 18:02.743
Expansion of the <i>Oral mucosa</i>,
the eyes, and the rectum

18:02.744 --> 18:05.418
to accommodate
rapid fluid loss.

18:06.932 --> 18:10.154
If it's a virus, it obviously
doesn't affect birds.

18:10.189 --> 18:12.474
<i>Or people,</i>
<i>at least not quickly.</i>

18:12.509 --> 18:15.222
Agent, I need this body
taken back to my lab.

18:15.223 --> 18:17.549
Hey, lunatic, this body's
going to the morgue.

18:18.506 --> 18:19.542
Is he crazy?

18:19.577 --> 18:20.294
Peter?

18:20.295 --> 18:21.630
Who is the agent
in charge here?

18:22.152 --> 18:23.032
I am.

18:23.660 --> 18:25.186
<i>Take it wherever</i>
<i>he wants.</i>

18:26.108 --> 18:26.827
Lovely.

18:29.871 --> 18:31.755
Is he crazy?

18:32.140 --> 18:33.398
Oh, yeah.

18:35.231 --> 18:37.571
<i>Whatever Fringe Division</i>
<i>is or was,</i>

18:37.606 --> 18:39.406
<i>F.B.I. says</i>
<i>it's been shut down.</i>

18:39.581 --> 18:41.582
<i>And yet I just</i>
<i>sent you a body.</i>

18:41.583 --> 18:42.583
Which does begs
the question,

18:43.947 --> 18:45.226
why are you doing this?

18:45.666 --> 18:48.339
Just following
the case.

18:48.423 --> 18:51.603
It doesn't pay to bluff
a bluffer, Agent Jessup.

18:51.946 --> 18:54.028
You know, a lot of people
would be scared by this.

18:55.226 --> 18:56.336
Most, actually.

18:58.200 --> 19:01.207
There are more things in Heaven
and Earth than are dreamt--

19:01.242 --> 19:03.337
Oh, wow.
Really?

19:03.338 --> 19:04.872
Butchered Shakespeare.

19:05.255 --> 19:06.474
<i>Peter.</i>

19:06.475 --> 19:07.490
Peter!

19:10.579 --> 19:14.193
They said I can ride
in the back with the body.

19:14.228 --> 19:15.049
<i>Can I?</i>

19:15.050 --> 19:17.406
Sure.
Of course you can.

19:19.028 --> 19:20.730
Stay out
of the medications, though.

19:21.667 --> 19:22.460
<i>Please.</i>

19:24.965 --> 19:27.392
Think I've been waiting
for you people my whole life.

19:38.306 --> 19:40.089
I'll be with you
in just a minute.

19:42.346 --> 19:46.992
So what can
I do you for?

19:47.249 --> 19:49.105
I'm looking
for a selectric.

19:49.140 --> 19:50.812
Selectric 251.

19:50.819 --> 19:52.866
Doesn't exist.
They never made one.

19:53.221 --> 19:56.320
It's 245,
straight to 255.

19:56.355 --> 19:56.691
No, no, no.

19:56.692 --> 19:59.166
I'm still gonna
need the 251.

20:01.062 --> 20:02.005
Ah.

20:03.823 --> 20:05.048
You're one of them.

20:09.137 --> 20:11.582
You know,
it's been six years.

20:11.606 --> 20:14.384
<i>I just kind of</i>
<i>figured that, uh...</i>

20:28.407 --> 20:29.641
<i>Straight back.</i>

20:30.128 --> 20:31.713
Last door.

20:34.809 --> 20:35.778
Hey.

20:36.264 --> 20:39.644
You--you tell 'em.
I'm not waiting around forever.

20:44.272 --> 20:46.340
I am not waiting
around forever.

21:59.798 --> 22:00.755
<i>What are we doing here?</i>

22:00.802 --> 22:02.462
<i>As I'm sure you're</i>
<i>probably already aware,</i>

22:02.497 --> 22:03.743
my father
was a scientist.

22:03.778 --> 22:05.324
Who was sent
to St. Claire's.

22:05.359 --> 22:08.623
A mental institution,
yes, but there is more.

22:08.624 --> 22:13.307
Worse. And some good, too.
It's complicated.

22:13.342 --> 22:14.870
But for right now,
all you really need to know

22:14.905 --> 22:17.411
is that this building
is where he used to work.

22:18.701 --> 22:20.235
He was working here
as a professor.

22:20.236 --> 22:21.770
Simultaneously,
he was working

22:21.771 --> 22:24.272
on a number of top-secret
government projects.

22:24.273 --> 22:26.078
We do our thing
down here in the lab

22:26.113 --> 22:27.476
because
according to him,

22:27.477 --> 22:29.312
it's the only place
that he can work.

22:30.224 --> 22:32.677
You're coming up on
your last chance to turn back.

22:33.507 --> 22:34.802
Are you kidding?

22:34.837 --> 22:36.161
Agent Jessup...

22:38.172 --> 22:39.491
Welcome to Fringe Division.

22:40.206 --> 22:43.325
Astrid, Amy.
Amy, Astrid. Nice haircut.

22:43.326 --> 22:44.977
Thanks. Hi.

22:45.012 --> 22:46.625
- Hello.
- Oh, hello.

22:46.660 --> 22:47.468
Again.

22:47.764 --> 22:51.913
I need four bunsen burners,
eight metal bowls yea big,

22:51.948 --> 22:52.829
and a freezer.

22:52.864 --> 22:53.902
The bowls need
to be sterilized?

22:53.903 --> 22:56.605
It's not for the autopsy.
It's for the custard.

22:56.606 --> 22:57.706
For Peter's birthday.

22:57.707 --> 22:59.574
Walter, will you
forget about the custard?

22:59.575 --> 23:00.809
I refuse.

23:00.810 --> 23:03.389
Also rib cutters,
toothed forceps,

23:03.459 --> 23:06.248
and a bone saw
for the autopsy.

23:06.249 --> 23:08.074
Not for the groceries.

23:12.755 --> 23:14.890
I got here
as fast as I could.

23:14.891 --> 23:16.056
I'm all right.

23:16.959 --> 23:19.178
You didn't have to come
all this way.

23:19.362 --> 23:20.462
You're not all right.

23:20.463 --> 23:22.330
Charlie, I'm fine.

23:29.505 --> 23:32.339
My second year
with Brooklyn P.D.,

23:32.374 --> 23:35.143
one night we get
a domestic disturbance call.

23:35.144 --> 23:36.745
Partner and I
go over to his house.

23:36.746 --> 23:38.580
I'm with the guy, right?

23:38.581 --> 23:39.782
And he's, uh...

23:40.349 --> 23:44.486
saying it's nothing, you know,
just a little argument.

23:44.487 --> 23:47.489
My partner calls
from the other room

23:47.490 --> 23:49.791
and says that we need
an ambulance for the girl.

23:49.792 --> 23:53.663
And I just know the guy beat
the crap out of his girlfriend,

23:53.698 --> 23:55.848
so I go for my gun,
I get him on the ground,

23:55.883 --> 23:56.992
and I'm cuffing him.

23:57.066 --> 23:59.541
And I hear a gunshot
from the other room.

24:01.594 --> 24:02.870
I turn around,

24:02.872 --> 24:04.756
and this, uh,

24:06.210 --> 24:07.303
bloody girl--

24:09.745 --> 24:12.781
brutalized,
brutalized girl--

24:12.782 --> 24:14.258
is, um...

24:17.687 --> 24:19.405
aiming a gun
at me.

24:22.792 --> 24:24.559
What I didn't know
at the time

24:24.560 --> 24:28.087
was she'd just
killed my partner.

24:34.070 --> 24:36.179
She fires.

24:36.372 --> 24:38.086
Hits me in my chest.

24:41.277 --> 24:43.267
Anyway, um...

24:45.029 --> 24:46.848
I'm in I.C.U.
for six days.

24:46.849 --> 24:49.652
You know, and, um,
hospital for two weeks.

24:49.687 --> 24:53.863
Kept on telling my wife,
"I'm fine."

24:55.950 --> 24:57.285
I was shaken,

24:57.827 --> 24:58.896
and I was scared.

25:04.200 --> 25:05.581
Now, if you're
like me,

25:08.804 --> 25:11.306
you got a gun
underneath your pillow.

25:13.798 --> 25:14.928
Peter called me.

25:23.536 --> 25:25.040
Hey.

25:26.722 --> 25:28.866
You can fool the doctors,
kiddo.

25:30.771 --> 25:32.004
You can't fool me.

25:36.933 --> 25:39.391
I don't know
what happened to me.

25:42.638 --> 25:44.415
I'm so scared.

25:48.945 --> 25:51.962
<i>I can't even</i>
<i>load it.</i>

25:52.114 --> 25:53.815
<i>My hand won't</i>
<i>stop shaking.</i>

25:54.275 --> 25:57.126
Charlie, I can't.
I can't even load it.

25:59.053 --> 26:00.490
You're gonna be
all right.

26:01.157 --> 26:02.524
Hey, it'll be all right.

26:06.619 --> 26:07.733
It's a shame.

26:07.897 --> 26:10.664
These lungs were
in excellent condition once.

26:11.767 --> 26:13.234
Is the half and half
boiling?

26:13.235 --> 26:14.936
Yeah, just about.

26:14.937 --> 26:18.270
Mix the eggs, sugar,
and salt in a separate bowl.

26:19.239 --> 26:20.344
Please.

26:21.277 --> 26:23.888
Walter, there's nothing
wrong with the blood sample.

26:26.160 --> 26:27.497
What are you thinking?

26:28.017 --> 26:29.102
It's funny.

26:29.152 --> 26:33.279
I love custard,
but I hate flan.

26:33.589 --> 26:36.270
Which could be
an issue of semantics.

26:36.305 --> 26:39.154
Or difficulty
with the French.

26:39.189 --> 26:40.104
Which I doubt,

26:40.139 --> 26:44.532
given my near obsession with
<i>Moules a la creme normande.</i>

26:44.533 --> 26:46.901
Well, that's fascinating,
but what I actually meant

26:46.902 --> 26:49.871
was are there any theories
about how this man died?

26:49.872 --> 26:52.507
No, the water
expulsion,

26:52.508 --> 26:54.542
though dramatic
and messy,

26:54.543 --> 26:58.513
seems to be a symptom
of some other process.

26:58.514 --> 27:02.350
But I stumbled upon something
that did the unthinkable.

27:03.384 --> 27:04.880
Look inside the mouth.

27:07.723 --> 27:09.605
You can come
closer, dear.

27:13.548 --> 27:15.697
Look at the soft palate.
What do you see?

27:17.464 --> 27:19.134
<i>There are three markings.</i>

27:19.135 --> 27:21.711
Indents like stab wounds.
What are they?

27:21.746 --> 27:22.715
<i>And while</i>
<i>we're at it,</i>

27:22.745 --> 27:24.252
what do you mean
you stumbled across something

27:24.287 --> 27:25.559
that does
the unthinkable?

27:26.924 --> 27:28.880
It made me
remember something.

27:33.816 --> 27:34.816
Is this you?

27:34.817 --> 27:35.942
Yeah.

27:36.085 --> 27:38.586
My father recently took
a little trip down memory lane,

27:38.587 --> 27:40.121
and for no reason
has become

27:40.122 --> 27:42.388
wildly obsessed
with my childhood.

27:42.651 --> 27:44.759
He also likes to check and make
sure that I'm still breathing

27:44.760 --> 27:45.860
when he thinks
that I'm asleep,

27:45.861 --> 27:47.153
which is
a little creepy.

27:48.024 --> 27:49.292
Focus, please.

27:50.366 --> 27:53.015
This is an experiment
that Belly and I did.

27:53.236 --> 27:56.079
<i>We came up with such</i>
<i>a spectacular blend of drugs.</i>

27:56.114 --> 27:58.758
One day,
Leary came by,

27:58.908 --> 28:01.218
and he said,
"You're kidding me."

28:01.762 --> 28:03.678
Is this gonna make
her head explode or something?

28:03.679 --> 28:06.448
Well, in a sense, yes,
but not physically.

28:06.449 --> 28:07.694
We're trying to augment

28:07.729 --> 28:10.518
her fifth, sixth,
and seventh chakras.

28:10.519 --> 28:11.920
Throat, third eye,
and crown.

28:11.921 --> 28:13.588
That is correct,
Asterix.

28:13.589 --> 28:14.756
Astrid.

28:14.757 --> 28:17.526
Communication, speech,
clairaudience,

28:17.561 --> 28:19.251
cognition,
and thought.

28:20.563 --> 28:21.393
Spirituality.

28:21.394 --> 28:22.125
<i>I can see Him.</i>

28:22.395 --> 28:23.631
You wanted her
to see God.

28:25.155 --> 28:25.908
<i>Who is he?</i>

28:26.068 --> 28:28.328
<i>The man
with the machine.</i>

28:30.072 --> 28:35.443
<i>The three--
the three nails.</i>

28:35.444 --> 28:37.712
<i>The three nails
go in the mouth.</i>

28:37.713 --> 28:39.427
There.

28:40.216 --> 28:41.915
<i>He is a soldier.</i>

28:43.986 --> 28:45.599
<i>From somewhere else.</i>

28:47.189 --> 28:49.643
<i>He's--he's from a place
that looks like this,</i>

28:49.678 --> 28:51.313
<i>but it's not here.</i>

28:51.594 --> 28:53.089
<i>Oh, he's--</i>

28:53.896 --> 28:56.131
<i>He's from
another universe, man.</i>

28:56.132 --> 29:00.001
<i>Oh, I can see him.</i>

29:00.002 --> 29:02.083
<i>He pushes up
the machine.</i>

29:02.105 --> 29:03.570
<i>He pushes up the machine?</i>

29:03.806 --> 29:05.957
Oh, yes,
in the mouth.

29:09.062 --> 29:10.352
And then he changes.

29:10.973 --> 29:13.880
<i>That's how they change.</i>
<i>They're like shape shifters.</i>

29:13.883 --> 29:16.018
<i>That's how they hide.</i>
<i>They can look like us.</i>

29:16.774 --> 29:18.892
They can look
like any of us.

29:20.727 --> 29:22.056
Astrid.

29:22.057 --> 29:24.373
I need you to log on to the
joint law enforcement database.

29:24.408 --> 29:25.193
We need to be
informed immediately

29:25.194 --> 29:27.227
of any corpse
that matches that description.

29:29.765 --> 29:31.503
<i>They can look
like any of us.</i>

29:51.240 --> 29:54.074
Unsubstantiated claims
of invasion.

29:54.075 --> 29:56.435
Reports of technology
run amok.

29:56.470 --> 30:00.714
The old "X" designation
and your fringe investigations

30:00.715 --> 30:03.050
have been indulgences
in the federal budget

30:03.051 --> 30:04.518
for over
half a century.

30:04.519 --> 30:08.690
Well, the salad days
are over, Mr. Broyles.

30:08.725 --> 30:09.598
Colonel.

30:09.633 --> 30:11.025
Excuse me?

30:11.026 --> 30:14.399
<i>Or Special Agent,</i>
<i>as you'd prefer, Senator.</i>

30:14.774 --> 30:16.278
<i>Colonel Broyles.</i>

30:17.199 --> 30:21.203
Philip, listen. We all have
a job here, and we--

30:21.238 --> 30:22.958
Yes, Senator,
I have a job.

30:23.538 --> 30:27.209
The same job I have had in three
administrations and six wars

30:27.244 --> 30:29.343
to defend our
national security,

30:29.344 --> 30:31.946
and I assure you
we are not secure.

30:31.947 --> 30:34.515
Yes, sometimes
a threat is familiar.

30:34.516 --> 30:37.351
But I have come to learn
that sometimes it is far worse.

30:37.352 --> 30:39.987
And when it is worse,
when the threat is unimaginable,

30:39.988 --> 30:42.337
that is when
we are at the door.

30:43.124 --> 30:45.767
And you should
thank God for that.

30:49.130 --> 30:51.098
Phillip, without
something usable,

30:51.099 --> 30:54.829
something to support
the human and fiscal cost...

30:56.404 --> 30:58.090
I-I'm sorry.

31:08.350 --> 31:11.115
If your appearance
is any indication...

31:12.938 --> 31:14.355
Now I don't have
to tell you

31:14.356 --> 31:17.663
how important it is that
Fringe Division not be shut down.

31:17.698 --> 31:18.926
I'm not the one
who needs convincing.

31:18.927 --> 31:20.094
But we've tried.

31:20.095 --> 31:22.796
I'm afraid that this one
is out of our hands.

31:33.575 --> 31:35.516
Do what you always
used to do, Phillip.

31:37.959 --> 31:39.313
Save the day.

31:58.682 --> 31:59.656
Feds?

31:59.901 --> 32:01.001
Yeah, that's us.

32:01.002 --> 32:02.836
Well, her, technically,
but say us.

32:02.837 --> 32:04.972
Where's the body
that triggered the alert?

32:04.973 --> 32:06.792
The one that has
the three holes in its mouth?

32:07.642 --> 32:08.907
It's right over there.

32:10.111 --> 32:11.111
Thank you.

32:17.185 --> 32:19.588
They found this guy two blocks
from the accident site.

32:19.623 --> 32:22.456
Shape shifters must leave
the original body behind.

32:22.724 --> 32:25.231
Do you remember
the girl from the video?

32:25.360 --> 32:27.698
That she said
he was a soldier?

32:28.496 --> 32:30.297
My father
was a soldier.

32:30.298 --> 32:32.333
They do one thing,
life or death.

32:33.135 --> 32:34.950
They stay on mission.

32:36.671 --> 32:38.005
These killings
weren't random.

32:38.006 --> 32:41.108
Which means this man,
this thing, whatever it is,

32:41.109 --> 32:42.916
it's still trying
to accomplish its goal.

32:42.951 --> 32:43.377
Olivia.

33:08.403 --> 33:09.970
Oh, my God.

33:10.486 --> 33:11.847
You scared me
to death.

33:14.343 --> 33:16.151
<i>We've sent his description
to hospital security</i>

33:16.186 --> 33:17.507
and dispatch
all available agents.

33:17.542 --> 33:18.833
<i>If he's there,</i>
<i>we'll get him.</i>

33:23.251 --> 33:24.995
You're looking better.

33:25.253 --> 33:28.244
Thank you. I'm starting to feel
a little bit more like me.

33:30.713 --> 33:32.370
So how's your memory?

33:33.061 --> 33:34.571
Still all
just fragments.

33:35.063 --> 33:37.498
I remember going to New York,
I remember driving,

33:37.499 --> 33:40.067
but I can't seem to see
anything past that.

33:46.773 --> 33:48.186
Happens with
head injuries.

33:48.309 --> 33:50.475
People can lose days
before an accident.

33:50.510 --> 33:53.295
The best thing to do is just
to keep trying, Olivia.

33:54.716 --> 33:58.896
I was on my way somewhere
to meet with someone.

33:59.570 --> 34:03.657
And I guess
someone hit my car.

34:07.104 --> 34:08.054
But--

34:08.556 --> 34:10.311
But...?

34:13.485 --> 34:15.324
It doesn't
make any sense.

34:16.649 --> 34:17.289
Mm-hmm.

34:18.911 --> 34:22.737
It's as if I went somewhere
and talked to someone.

34:23.121 --> 34:23.913
And then...

34:26.351 --> 34:28.145
came back
to the accident.

34:31.719 --> 34:35.054
Do you remember who
you were going to meet with?

34:36.516 --> 34:37.369
No.

34:40.195 --> 34:42.018
Almost.

34:44.565 --> 34:45.933
He told me something.

34:47.318 --> 34:48.150
What?

34:49.612 --> 34:50.989
Go on.

34:51.072 --> 34:52.371
I can't, uh--

34:52.616 --> 34:53.851
Try.

34:58.999 --> 35:00.303
Something's hidden.

35:00.338 --> 35:01.813
Yes. Where?

35:04.327 --> 35:05.307
I-I can't--

35:05.342 --> 35:07.005
Where is it hidden?

35:10.358 --> 35:11.692
I can't remember.

35:19.334 --> 35:22.102
That's really all
you know then, isn't it?

35:23.038 --> 35:23.869
Yeah.

35:27.710 --> 35:28.606
Okay.

35:44.759 --> 35:46.864
They have surveillance of
your suspect entering the lobby.

35:46.899 --> 35:47.516
Olivia's room?

35:47.551 --> 35:49.363
The floor's locked up
six ways from Sunday.

35:49.364 --> 35:51.052
The only person
allowed in is the nurse.

35:56.627 --> 35:58.578
Don't fight it.
It's over.

36:06.147 --> 36:09.117
Agent Francis,
suspect is now white female,

36:09.152 --> 36:10.784
black hair, scrubs,
gray sweater.

36:10.785 --> 36:11.920
She jumped down
to the loading dock,

36:11.955 --> 36:13.384
but she's heading
into the basement.

36:15.526 --> 36:16.349
You okay?

36:16.384 --> 36:17.457
Go get that bitch.

37:28.883 --> 37:30.256
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

37:34.632 --> 37:36.169
Charlie! Hey!
You okay? You hit?

37:36.170 --> 37:37.294
<i>I'm good.</i>

38:12.652 --> 38:14.217
So who was she?

38:14.288 --> 38:17.691
Walter thinks that she was
a shape-changing soldier

38:17.726 --> 38:19.137
from another universe.

38:20.160 --> 38:22.165
He thinks that might be
where you went.

38:23.296 --> 38:25.564
Hmm.

38:25.565 --> 38:27.803
Do you think it's a bad sign
that I can say that out loud

38:27.838 --> 38:29.568
and neither one of us
thinks I'm crazy?

38:34.441 --> 38:36.603
She thought I knew where
something was hidden.

38:36.638 --> 38:38.111
No matter what happened
to you,

38:38.146 --> 38:39.782
and no matter where
you went,

38:40.847 --> 38:42.631
Walter will
figure it out.

38:51.725 --> 38:53.125
Olivia, I need
to ask you something.

38:53.687 --> 38:54.830
Sure.

38:59.633 --> 39:02.869
<i>Einai kalytero anthropo</i>
<i>apo ton patera toy.</i>

39:05.739 --> 39:09.175
<i>You said that to me</i>
<i>just after you woke up.</i>

39:09.176 --> 39:10.000
<i>Do you remember it?</i>

39:12.512 --> 39:13.505
No.

39:15.782 --> 39:16.782
Latin?

39:17.560 --> 39:19.675
Mm-mm. Greek.

39:24.491 --> 39:25.692
My mother used to
say that to me

39:25.727 --> 39:27.408
every night before
I went to bed.

39:30.397 --> 39:31.531
There really
isn't a point

39:31.566 --> 39:33.764
where things just can't
get weirder, is there?

39:39.372 --> 39:40.577
What does it mean?

39:42.576 --> 39:45.133
It means, "Be a better man
than your father."

39:51.117 --> 39:52.581
Walter was already gone.

39:55.422 --> 39:57.539
It was like a code
between my mother and me.

39:59.025 --> 40:01.020
It meant keep
your people close.

40:02.195 --> 40:04.100
Take care of the people
you care about.

40:07.834 --> 40:09.389
Well, you're
good at that.

40:17.777 --> 40:20.297
It's good to see you again,
Olivia Dunham.

40:22.326 --> 40:23.798
It's good
to see you too.

40:26.361 --> 40:27.876
<i>It's time to check your vitals.</i>

40:30.291 --> 40:31.630
You should get
some rest.

40:36.147 --> 40:36.882
<i>Peter.</i>

40:37.998 --> 40:40.315
Is it true that
they're shutting us down?

40:42.969 --> 40:44.027
No.

40:50.667 --> 40:51.644
Agent Broyles.

40:52.112 --> 40:53.158
Mr. Bishop.

40:53.280 --> 40:57.048
At the bar, you said
they needed to see results.

40:57.083 --> 40:57.736
Yeah.

41:00.887 --> 41:03.265
Walter says this tech
isn't from here.

41:03.300 --> 41:04.256
And that it's broken.

41:04.257 --> 41:05.844
But it is proof.

41:06.459 --> 41:09.561
And if they can fix it,
they can have an army

41:09.562 --> 41:11.563
who can look like
anyone they want them to.

41:11.564 --> 41:13.052
You tell them
you can get this tech,

41:13.112 --> 41:13.839
and they can have it,

41:13.879 --> 41:15.738
but they are not
shutting us down.

41:16.952 --> 41:19.601
From now on,
we're calling the shots.

41:19.636 --> 41:21.160
We're done reacting.

41:22.264 --> 41:24.191
We're not gonna be
too late anymore.

41:30.016 --> 41:30.711
After all,

41:31.603 --> 41:33.663
somebody's got to save
their asses, right?

41:37.891 --> 41:39.873
You surprise me,
Mr. Bishop.

41:43.488 --> 41:44.251
Thanks.

42:26.573 --> 42:29.921
Happy birthday, Peter!

42:30.610 --> 42:32.611
Look.
Custard.

42:32.746 --> 42:34.613
<i>Happy birthday, Peter.</i>
