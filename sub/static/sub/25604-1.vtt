00:08.760 --> 00:10.080
<i>Do you believe in God?</i>

00:26.960 --> 00:28.480
<i>God doesn't give a fuck.</i>

01:08.360 --> 01:11.160
Yes, I knew...

01:13.880 --> 01:17.760
how they have fucked you over
for 20 years.

01:34.480 --> 01:36.480
<i>Sometimes, I feel like I am God.</i>

02:00.120 --> 02:01.200
<i>It's my story.</i>

02:01.880 --> 02:04.680
<i>Everyone else is playing their part in it.</i>

02:08.720 --> 02:11.000
<i>And I connect them together.</i>

02:59.360 --> 03:00.200
Bunty.

03:00.760 --> 03:01.680
Where is Bunty?

03:02.960 --> 03:04.800
Check inside your asshole.

03:29.400 --> 03:31.360
-Listen.
-<i>Yes, sir.</i>

03:31.440 --> 03:32.680
I want Sartaj.

03:33.160 --> 03:35.240
-Today. Right now.
<i>-Yes, sir.</i>

03:35.440 --> 03:38.440
<i>I don't know how this world</i>
<i>came into existence,</i>

03:38.760 --> 03:41.360
<i>but I do know how it will come to an end.</i>

04:40.200 --> 04:42.840
Okay, all right. Move back, move back.

04:50.640 --> 04:54.480
It's a gruesome murder.
Must have been an expensive watch.

04:56.920 --> 04:59.040
Expensive enough to get him killed.

05:03.480 --> 05:04.400
Any witnesses?

05:05.760 --> 05:06.600
None.

05:11.960 --> 05:13.840
Sir, it's time for your hearing.

05:15.120 --> 05:17.480
Parulkar will be pissed if you're late.

05:18.720 --> 05:21.360
Just say what Parulkar wants you to.

05:38.200 --> 05:40.400
<i>Junaid had a weapon.</i>

05:41.440 --> 05:42.400
<i>A homemade gun.</i>

05:43.400 --> 05:45.800
We warned him to surrender.

05:46.960 --> 05:49.600
But he responded by firing...

05:50.720 --> 05:52.040
at Constable Raut.

05:52.760 --> 05:55.280
Constable Raut was shot and he fell down.

05:55.960 --> 05:59.680
The boy tried to run away,

06:00.320 --> 06:03.360
and Mr. Parulkar went after him.

06:04.560 --> 06:09.200
We had the area sealed.
He couldn't have escaped.

06:10.440 --> 06:14.960
He pointed the revolver at Mr. Parulkar.

06:16.200 --> 06:19.160
Mr. Parulkar immediately warned him
to put it down,

06:19.240 --> 06:21.760
but Junaid was going to pull the trigger.

06:21.880 --> 06:24.560
Before he could fire...

06:32.680 --> 06:37.400
Sir, before he could fire,
Mr. Parulkar fired three rounds at him.

06:59.320 --> 07:01.080
What the fuck were you doing?

07:01.680 --> 07:03.640
Did you forget what we told you?

07:03.760 --> 07:04.640
Tell me.

07:05.400 --> 07:08.480
-Are you going to turn us all in?
-What's happening?

07:08.960 --> 07:09.960
Majid?

07:18.320 --> 07:19.480
He was an 18-year-old kid.

07:19.560 --> 07:21.640
Is there an age limit
to become a terrorist?

07:22.560 --> 07:24.000
We could have arrested him.

07:26.280 --> 07:27.360
Is he new here?

07:31.040 --> 07:32.200
He was surrendering.

07:32.280 --> 07:34.800
There's so much filth
in this city, Sartaj.

07:35.720 --> 07:38.480
-We can't always follow procedure...
-Can you say that to his father?

07:38.560 --> 07:40.560
Have you ever solved a case?

07:41.320 --> 07:43.400
Do you want to be
the next Ramakant Jadhav?

07:44.000 --> 07:46.840
-Google him, he tried to testify too.
-Majid...

07:49.320 --> 07:50.280
Go see a doctor.

07:50.920 --> 07:52.120
We'll talk tomorrow.

07:56.200 --> 07:57.040
Okay. Don't come.

08:00.480 --> 08:04.000
Tomorrow's report will state
that you killed Junaid. Then what?

08:13.280 --> 08:15.280
It's a good thing Megha left you.

08:59.800 --> 09:01.160
He plays tennis.

09:04.320 --> 09:05.600
Ever played tennis?

09:12.800 --> 09:15.280
Ms. Megha is looking at us. Shall we go?

09:16.440 --> 09:19.920
<i>I won't ever forget</i>

09:20.000 --> 09:23.400
<i>Neither will I</i>

09:26.520 --> 09:30.800
Once... Dad decided to take us
to the Golden Temple.

09:33.000 --> 09:34.520
It was a big deal for us.

09:35.480 --> 09:39.080
-Visiting Amritsar...
-Is the Golden Temple made of gold?

09:39.160 --> 09:40.360
Listen.

09:40.440 --> 09:42.040
The day we had to leave...

09:43.840 --> 09:46.160
Dad was summoned to the police station.

09:46.960 --> 09:48.600
There had been an accident.

09:49.160 --> 09:54.280
A car had run over a beggar kid.

09:55.320 --> 09:56.800
Someone had to go to the hospital.

09:58.960 --> 10:00.320
Anyone could have gone.

10:03.480 --> 10:05.720
But Dad canceled the trip to Amritsar.

10:08.640 --> 10:09.840
I cried for days.

10:12.840 --> 10:16.400
I stole a 10-rupee bill
from Dad's wallet and burned it.

10:19.200 --> 10:20.240
Back in 1990.

10:22.240 --> 10:24.040
Mom slapped me later.

10:26.320 --> 10:27.880
You know what my dad said?

10:29.240 --> 10:33.360
"I was meant to go and see that kid."

10:39.120 --> 10:40.720
I wanted to be like my dad.

10:43.520 --> 10:44.840
A good policeman.

10:49.840 --> 10:51.520
Sir, you worry a lot.

10:53.560 --> 10:56.560
Parulkar has the Inquiry Commission
in his pocket.

10:57.120 --> 11:02.320
It doesn't matter what you do
or say at this point.

11:02.840 --> 11:05.840
I was in the street... blocking the exit.

11:07.640 --> 11:09.400
He came running towards me...

11:10.360 --> 11:11.320
unarmed.

11:11.920 --> 11:14.720
<i>-He was in his late teens.</i>
-Sir...

11:15.680 --> 11:17.680
<i>-He started crying when he saw me.</i>
-Sir...

11:17.760 --> 11:19.280
Sir, save me!

11:19.360 --> 11:21.040
<i>Parulkar came from the other side.</i>

11:21.120 --> 11:22.040
He's surrendering, sir!

11:22.120 --> 11:23.880
<i>I yelled out that he was surrendering...</i>

11:26.840 --> 11:28.040
<i>but he shot him.</i>

11:36.240 --> 11:39.920
Sir, everything will be fine
once you solve a big case.

11:40.080 --> 11:42.080
How will that happen?

11:44.440 --> 11:47.840
In the last ten years, all I've managed
to do is catch Sonu, a pickpocket.

11:56.240 --> 11:57.160
<i>Sir,</i>

11:57.720 --> 11:59.040
<i>do you believe in God?</i>

11:59.640 --> 12:00.480
Who is this?

12:02.840 --> 12:04.760
Speak up, motherfucker. Who is this?

12:10.880 --> 12:12.520
I want to tell you a story.

12:13.120 --> 12:14.040
<i>Go ahead.</i>

12:20.720 --> 12:23.320
-Who was it?
-I don't know. Some asshole.

12:24.480 --> 12:26.040
Should I trace the number?

13:55.520 --> 13:56.520
Fuck!

14:48.520 --> 14:49.640
<i>Forget about God.</i>

14:51.600 --> 14:53.080
<i>Do you believe in magic?</i>

14:53.800 --> 14:56.640
<i>Sometimes, I feel like my life is magical.</i>

14:57.920 --> 14:58.920
Are you crazy?

15:00.160 --> 15:02.320
Why did you end up in the police force?

15:02.440 --> 15:06.760
You wanted to be like Gavaskar,
but you're handling Tendulkar's security.

15:08.160 --> 15:09.000
Who is this?

15:11.200 --> 15:12.840
<i>You have to save your city.</i>

15:13.680 --> 15:15.840
<i>I heard you love this city.</i>

15:17.680 --> 15:18.840
Who is this?

15:19.640 --> 15:21.640
An old friend of Dilbagh Singh.

15:25.680 --> 15:27.280
How do you know my father?

15:28.920 --> 15:29.920
Listen.

15:32.000 --> 15:33.560
Your destiny will change.

15:35.440 --> 15:38.560
-You'll change my destiny?
-We'll change each other's.

15:39.440 --> 15:40.400
How?

15:43.000 --> 15:44.840
If you tell them who called...

15:45.880 --> 15:48.400
they'll forget about Sonu, the pickpocket.

16:00.800 --> 16:02.360
Are you one of Ravi Pandit's guys?

16:04.440 --> 16:07.240
Ravi Pandit is a little shit.

16:07.320 --> 16:11.080
I wouldn't fuck with your sleep
for that nobody.

16:11.640 --> 16:15.600
Stop bullshitting. Who are you?
Do you have a lead or not?

16:16.840 --> 16:18.480
They're going to kill me.

16:19.680 --> 16:21.760
I can't trust anyone in this city.

16:21.880 --> 16:23.880
Then I remembered Dilbagh Singh.

16:27.320 --> 16:28.800
Who's going to kill you?

16:30.000 --> 16:31.800
How do you know Dilbagh Singh?

16:32.720 --> 16:34.560
Mr. Sartaj, how I know him...

16:36.560 --> 16:38.560
is not that easy to explain.

16:41.120 --> 16:45.040
When I was 10 or 11 years old...

16:46.160 --> 16:47.840
this day was decided.

16:50.040 --> 16:52.680
This very moment... our connection...

16:54.040 --> 16:56.000
you, Dilbagh Singh and I.

16:57.680 --> 16:59.840
<i>I could see my destiny in the water.</i>

17:00.480 --> 17:04.160
<i>Ever since I was a kid, I've felt like</i>
<i>my life was a story from the scriptures.</i>

17:04.640 --> 17:08.760
<i>Like the whole world, including my father,</i>
<i>was a part of my story.</i>

17:21.240 --> 17:25.240
<i>The drought lasted for a thousand years</i>
<i>before Sage Gautama meditated</i>

17:25.320 --> 17:27.160
<i>and manifested the River Ganges.</i>

17:27.240 --> 17:30.120
<i>In my village,</i>
<i>the Ganges was known as the Godavari.</i>

17:30.200 --> 17:31.960
<i>My father was a priest there,</i>

17:32.360 --> 17:34.640
<i>but he was nothing more than a beggar.</i>

17:44.200 --> 17:46.000
<i>Please help me.</i>

17:46.920 --> 17:48.000
Ma'am, help me.

17:48.080 --> 17:50.400
Dad, is God everywhere? Of course. He's everywhere.

17:53.200 --> 17:56.560
He's in every grain of rice in this bag.

17:56.640 --> 17:58.120
But he doesn't beg.

17:59.160 --> 18:01.240
<i>My father's weakness disgusted me.</i>

18:02.200 --> 18:05.560
<i>That's when I decided</i>
<i>that I would be the master of my fate.</i>

18:09.400 --> 18:11.960
<i>Sir, the DOT is tracing the number.</i>

18:12.080 --> 18:14.840
<i>He's somewhere near the Metro Theater.</i>

18:17.840 --> 18:18.920
Tell me more.

18:21.080 --> 18:22.000
My mother...

18:24.640 --> 18:26.120
she was very affectionate.

18:27.480 --> 18:29.560
<i>I don't know how my dad found her.</i>

18:29.960 --> 18:30.880
Come here.

18:31.880 --> 18:33.480
<i>When it was dark...</i>

18:34.760 --> 18:36.720
<i>she was the light in our lives.</i>

18:37.360 --> 18:38.760
How is it? Beautiful, right?

18:40.160 --> 18:43.560
<i>She always made herself beautiful</i>
<i>for that beggar.</i>

18:49.160 --> 18:50.000
Mom.

18:53.040 --> 18:54.560
Mom, where did you get this from?

19:00.280 --> 19:03.840
<i>I knew this dream wouldn't last.</i>

19:04.800 --> 19:08.080
<i>While my beggar father slept,</i>
<i>my mother stayed awake...</i>

19:09.360 --> 19:12.880
<i>and she slept while he was awake.</i>

19:13.360 --> 19:16.600
<i>She was only truly alive when he was gone.</i>

19:17.840 --> 19:20.160
<i>Her world would come alive then.</i>

19:23.760 --> 19:26.960
What are you doing?
Are you crazy? Ganesh is sleeping.

19:27.040 --> 19:28.880
So what? I want to sleep with you.

19:29.000 --> 19:31.840
Come back when Ganesh is at school.

19:31.920 --> 19:35.360
There's no school tomorrow. It's Sunday.
I want to do it now.

19:35.440 --> 19:38.000
What are you doing? What if he wakes up?

19:38.080 --> 19:39.440
Let him wake up.

19:46.080 --> 19:48.800
You're going to hit me?
You son of a bitch!

19:49.360 --> 19:51.280
Do you have the courage? You fucker!

19:51.360 --> 19:54.160
Watch your mouth or I'll hit you.

20:01.440 --> 20:04.080
<i>Some of my childhood memories</i>
<i>are still fresh.</i>

20:06.800 --> 20:08.000
Why are you crying?

20:08.080 --> 20:09.680
Because I tore your shirt?

20:10.200 --> 20:13.400
Your whore of a mother
can buy you a new shirt every day.

20:16.080 --> 20:18.960
<i>And some of it feels like</i>
<i>it never happened.</i>

20:19.880 --> 20:21.720
<i>Like it was a part of my past life.</i>

21:12.280 --> 21:15.160
<i>It feels like yesterday</i>
<i>when I was running madly.</i>

21:15.280 --> 21:17.720
<i>From the fields, from my home,</i>
<i>from the Godavari,</i>

21:17.840 --> 21:20.000
<i>from my father's chanting,</i>
<i>and from his God.</i>

21:20.120 --> 21:22.320
<i>And it feels like a lifetime</i>

21:22.520 --> 21:24.000
<i>since I saw my mother.</i>

21:33.880 --> 21:34.880
<i>What is religion?</i>

21:35.800 --> 21:37.160
<i>The mother or the father?</i>

21:37.600 --> 21:40.200
<i>Whatever it is, I was free of it now.</i>

21:41.160 --> 21:43.600
<i>I needed a new religion.</i>

21:45.480 --> 21:46.440
<i>Bombay.</i>

22:13.480 --> 22:14.680
<i>What is it, sir?</i>

22:15.960 --> 22:17.560
<i>Are you trying to find me?</i>

22:18.240 --> 22:20.080
Why would I be looking for you?

22:20.880 --> 22:22.920
I'm hungry. I want eggs.

22:24.200 --> 22:26.040
<i>Should I get you a chicken?</i>

22:26.120 --> 22:30.040
Yes, I'm at the Metro Circle.
Do you know the name of the building?

22:30.520 --> 22:33.360
<i>Sir, he's somewhere close by.</i>

22:34.680 --> 22:37.320
<i>The next street has the best Anda Pav.</i>

22:37.440 --> 22:38.440
<i>Opposite Kyani.</i>

22:40.720 --> 22:41.960
<i>I'm right there.</i>

22:42.760 --> 22:45.240
<i>Come, let's eat together.</i>

22:57.320 --> 23:00.000
<i>You'll find Sunil there.</i>
<i>Tell him I say hi.</i>

23:01.240 --> 23:02.960
<i>He chops onions really fast.</i> Are you fucking around
with a signal scrambler?

23:05.880 --> 23:08.520
<i>I have a story to tell,</i>
<i>so I need your time.</i>

23:08.640 --> 23:11.320
<i>-So I took you for a ride.</i>
-I heard your story.

23:11.400 --> 23:13.520
Your mom was a whore
and your dad was an asshole.

23:13.600 --> 23:15.120
Watch your mouth, sir.

23:15.640 --> 23:18.320
-Do you know who I am?
-A small-time thug

23:18.960 --> 23:20.840
<i>with a small dick and no balls.</i>

23:21.200 --> 23:23.640
Call a doctor
and stop fucking around with me.

23:25.200 --> 23:29.680
<i>RCN number 215578, 18th December, 2006.</i>

<i>that a faction of ISI has gone rogue</i>

24:48.200 --> 24:51.000
<i>and is smuggling fake currency into India.</i>

24:51.080 --> 24:55.680
<i>They are planning something disastrous</i>
<i>against India with Hizbuddin's support.</i>

24:55.880 --> 24:57.280
<i>I'm asking you to send help.</i>

24:57.360 --> 24:59.920
<i>If you can get some Indian support</i>
<i>for our freedom,</i>

25:00.000 --> 25:01.560
<i>I can give you some names.</i>

25:04.200 --> 25:05.320
Sir, we're closed.

25:05.400 --> 25:08.200
I told you that I spoke to Mr. Parulkar.

25:08.280 --> 25:10.680
Come back in the morning.
I need to enter it in the register.

25:12.320 --> 25:13.840
It's an unusual situation.

25:13.920 --> 25:16.320
You'll get a letter
from the DCP's office tomorrow.

25:19.120 --> 25:19.960
Did you hear that?

25:20.040 --> 25:23.840
He mentioned Kailashpada Police Station.
Did you hear that?

25:24.680 --> 25:26.320
He's been missing for 17 years.

25:26.440 --> 25:30.040
He hasn't been in India for 23 years.
It can't be him.

25:30.120 --> 25:32.040
He has 158 murder cases against him.

25:32.120 --> 25:35.080
He fucked both RAW and ISI
before disappearing. -Where are the classified files?
-In that corner. Row number 30.

25:38.840 --> 25:41.760
He must be crazy to come back.

25:42.200 --> 25:44.440
-Where are you going?
-I'm going to hell.

26:01.680 --> 26:03.000
215578.

26:20.360 --> 26:21.760
215578.

26:36.440 --> 26:37.520
"Ganesh Eknath... Gaitonde."

26:59.720 --> 27:01.000
<i>Are you frightened?</i>

27:03.360 --> 27:05.360
<i>What will you do now, Mr. Sartaj?</i>

27:07.040 --> 27:08.440
Why did you call me?

27:09.000 --> 27:10.720
How can I tell you if you won't listen?

27:11.840 --> 27:13.600
Where have you been for the past 15 years?

27:14.560 --> 27:16.680
Singapore? Malaysia?

27:17.840 --> 27:19.880
<i>Right here in Zone 13.</i>

27:23.720 --> 27:26.000
<i>Sir, it's a trap. Call for backup.</i>

27:26.560 --> 27:30.320
How will that help me?
I'll be back to doing the same old shit.

27:31.320 --> 27:33.320
Parulkar and Majid will be pissed.

27:34.640 --> 27:35.720
Fuck Majid.

27:38.720 --> 27:41.320
<i>-How far is it from there?</i>
-Twenty minutes.

27:41.400 --> 27:44.480
<i>That's some speed.</i>
<i>Are you in love with Bombay now?</i>

27:45.040 --> 27:46.600
We live like cockroaches.

27:46.760 --> 27:48.520
What's there to love?

27:49.640 --> 27:52.000
<i>Try going out at night.</i>
<i>If I didn't love this city...</i>

27:52.960 --> 27:56.560
<i>I wouldn't have built my empire here</i>
<i>in the garbage dumps.</i>

27:56.640 --> 27:58.280
This is what Bombay is now.

27:59.360 --> 28:01.440
An empire amongst garbage dumps.

28:02.640 --> 28:06.040
<i>That's the beauty of this city, sir.</i>
<i>Anything is possible.</i>

28:06.680 --> 28:09.880
<i>In 1977, Indira Gandhi's Emergency</i>
<i>reigned over the country.</i>

28:10.560 --> 28:12.840
<i>The government was sterilizing its people.</i>

28:23.760 --> 28:27.120
<i>But Bombay... Bombay didn't slow down.</i>

28:27.600 --> 28:29.240
<i>Everybody found work here.</i>

28:29.720 --> 28:32.200
<i>I benefited from being a Brahmin's son.</i>

28:33.200 --> 28:35.320
SATYANARAYAN SHUKLA
UPPER-CASTE HINDU HOTEL - PURE VEGETARIAN

28:36.800 --> 28:38.360
<i>Shukla Seth, Hindu Hotel.</i>

28:39.400 --> 28:42.600
<i>A regular meal for 8 rupees,</i>
<i>a deluxe meal for 12 rupees.</i>

28:42.680 --> 28:43.880
Hurry up!

28:45.760 --> 28:49.240
<i>They used baking soda in the rice</i>
<i>and fake ghee in the dal.</i>

28:57.240 --> 28:59.920
Why are you touching the rice
with your dirty hands?

29:00.040 --> 29:02.160
This is the Hindu Hotel!

29:03.560 --> 29:06.640
People don't come here
because we serve good food.

29:07.080 --> 29:11.240
They come because everything here
is clean and pure.

29:12.080 --> 29:15.280
Everyone from the cook to the waiter
belongs to the upper caste.

29:15.360 --> 29:17.680
<i>Religion found business in purity.</i>

29:18.960 --> 29:21.960
<i>I made sin a business.</i>

29:23.240 --> 29:25.200
<i>Bombay had a booming market for drugs.</i>

29:25.280 --> 29:27.280
<i>I wanted to dig in.</i>

29:27.440 --> 29:28.440
Mandrax.

29:29.600 --> 29:31.280
One pill costs 10 rupees.

29:32.720 --> 29:34.760
Two for you and eight for Mathu.

29:37.320 --> 29:39.280
Don't lick it, swallow it.

29:40.560 --> 29:41.400
Okay.

29:42.600 --> 29:44.720
Mandrax gives you the ultimate kick.

29:45.680 --> 29:48.560
The craving for it will grow
with every passing day.

29:48.680 --> 29:49.880
It's the best business.

29:51.600 --> 29:54.360
<i>Mathu taught me how to sell.</i>

29:54.680 --> 29:58.040
<i>If the guy had red eyes and dark circles,</i>
<i>he would definitely buy Mandrax.</i>

30:21.080 --> 30:23.720
<i>I could have been high on Mandrax,</i>
<i>or under a spell.</i>

30:24.280 --> 30:28.360
<i>Shukla Seth beat me black and blue,</i>
<i>but I felt no pain.</i>

30:28.440 --> 30:32.600
Bastard! Son of a whore!
I told you, no bullshit here.

30:34.840 --> 30:37.400
<i>Ever since then,</i>
<i>I've known that I am Ashwathama.</i>

30:37.600 --> 30:38.840
<i>I'm immortal.</i>

30:46.520 --> 30:48.760
Sir, you haven't given me my salary.

30:49.560 --> 30:52.520
You don't do any work,
and then you ask for a salary?

30:53.320 --> 30:54.920
Work for three more months.

30:55.000 --> 30:57.560
I haven't gotten anything
for two months, sir.

30:58.040 --> 30:58.880
You will.

31:07.480 --> 31:09.920
<i>My dickhead boss owned a scooter,</i>

31:10.360 --> 31:12.560
<i>but he drove it like it was Isa's red car.</i>

31:12.680 --> 31:15.600
<i>I'll tell you about Isa later.</i>

31:16.240 --> 31:18.880
<i>I fantasized about his red car.</i>

31:19.080 --> 31:20.880
<i>I wanted it.</i>

31:22.320 --> 31:24.480
-Eat.
-<i>Mathu told me to be brave.</i>

31:24.800 --> 31:27.080
<i>Being brave meant becoming a sinner.</i>

31:27.480 --> 31:31.680
Don't think so much.
Think of it as a vegetable,

31:32.240 --> 31:33.760
not a dead bird.

31:33.880 --> 31:37.360
Rip it and eat it like a jackfruit.
Try it.

31:40.080 --> 31:44.320
<i>A chicken bone in a Hindu hotel</i>
<i>can cause more damage than any gangster.</i>

31:44.960 --> 31:47.640
<i>It's been happening</i>
<i>since pre-independence days.</i>

31:47.720 --> 31:51.120
<i>To create a rift amongst the Muslims,</i>
<i>dump pork in a mosque.</i>

31:51.600 --> 31:54.200
<i>To incite riots amongst the Hindus,</i>

31:54.280 --> 31:55.920
<i>dump beef in a temple.</i>

31:56.160 --> 31:59.400
<i>And for a devout Hindu, a bone was enough.</i>

32:27.000 --> 32:31.800
<i>From the Hindu Hotel I learned</i>
<i>how religion can fuck anyone over.</i>

32:32.920 --> 32:35.400
<i>I had much more to learn.</i>

32:35.960 --> 32:38.400
<i>I had to meet Mathu's boss, Salim Kaka.</i>

32:38.600 --> 32:39.600
<i>Salim Kaka.</i>

32:39.920 --> 32:43.120
<i>An Afghan bull,</i>
<i>the king of gold smuggling.</i>

32:43.440 --> 32:44.760
<i>My second father.</i>

32:48.480 --> 32:50.680
Are you done? Now give me the tip.

32:50.880 --> 32:54.560
<i>Close your eyes and chant</i>
<i>"I am the Alpha and the Omega."</i>

32:54.960 --> 32:56.000
What?

32:56.080 --> 32:57.880
<i>I am the alpha and the omega.</i>

32:58.040 --> 32:59.760
<i>Everything will become clear.</i>

33:00.280 --> 33:03.160
<i>Your thoughts... will turn into reality.</i>

33:03.800 --> 33:08.280
If God wasn't real, how would we
have conceived the idea of him?

33:10.040 --> 33:13.680
God talks to us through stories.

33:14.720 --> 33:15.720
Our lives...

33:17.880 --> 33:18.840
are the stories.

33:28.480 --> 33:29.840
Someone is monitoring the call.

33:30.400 --> 33:31.360
What?

33:39.160 --> 33:41.680
You have 25 days to save your city.

33:41.760 --> 33:44.440
Twenty-five days?
What will happen in 25 days?

33:45.040 --> 33:46.840
<i>-Where are you?</i>
<i>-I don't know, sir.</i>

33:46.920 --> 33:48.240
I'm almost there.

33:48.840 --> 33:51.040
-Sorry, sir.
-Don't hang up!

33:53.120 --> 33:54.360
Fuck!

34:00.200 --> 34:02.000
It's auto-erasing from a remote server.

34:02.840 --> 34:05.360
-I don't think we'll get anything.
-We have this, right?

34:07.000 --> 34:08.680
I don't know what it is.

34:21.240 --> 34:24.920
Listen, was there ever a garbage dump
in Zone 13?

34:26.200 --> 34:27.640
<i>Garbage?</i>

34:28.320 --> 34:29.840
-Yes...
-He said...

34:29.920 --> 34:33.120
<i>There was one, sir. A long time ago.</i>

34:33.440 --> 34:34.880
<i>Around 25, 30 years ago.</i>

34:35.480 --> 34:38.120
<i>There's a mall there now. DMD Mall.</i>

37:06.880 --> 37:09.280
<i>You can try using dynamite,</i>
<i>but this door won't open.</i>

37:10.560 --> 37:12.360
<i>Save your city, Mr. Sartaj.</i>

37:13.160 --> 37:15.160
<i>Sit on the chair.</i>

37:33.120 --> 37:35.000
<i>Eager to nab me, aren't you?</i>

37:35.920 --> 37:39.880
-What will happen in 25 days?
<i>-Everyone is going to die in 25 days.</i>

37:40.280 --> 37:42.040
<i>Only Trivedi will be safe.</i>

37:42.600 --> 37:43.680
Who's Trivedi?

37:44.400 --> 37:45.800
<i>An asshole. Fuck him.</i>

37:49.040 --> 37:50.400
Why will he be safe?

37:50.880 --> 37:55.480
<i>My father is going to fuck everyone,</i>
<i>but I'll save Trivedi.</i>

37:56.000 --> 37:58.360
Which father? The village priest?

37:58.520 --> 38:00.480
<i>No, sir. I have three fathers.</i>

38:00.680 --> 38:02.880
<i>All three of them fucked me up.</i>

38:02.960 --> 38:06.080
<i>The first one instilled fear in me,</i>
<i>the second gave me guts.</i>

38:06.200 --> 38:09.840
<i>The last one,</i>
<i>the one I loved the most, betrayed me.</i>

38:10.160 --> 38:11.240
How?

38:11.320 --> 38:14.720
<i>The first father was a priest.</i>
<i>I didn't want to be like him.</i>

38:14.800 --> 38:18.440
<i>The second father, Salim Kaka,</i>
<i>whose eyes told me,</i>

38:18.800 --> 38:22.680
<i>"Gaitonde, if you kill me,</i>
<i>you'll become immortal.</i>

38:23.040 --> 38:25.480
<i>You are Ashwathama!"</i>

38:34.480 --> 38:35.480
Hop on.

38:37.480 --> 38:38.360
Sit down.

38:41.280 --> 38:42.400
Don't utter a word.

38:44.600 --> 38:46.200
I told you not to do it.

38:50.880 --> 38:53.760
<i>Salim Kaka was also known</i>
<i>as the ball-breaker.</i>

38:53.840 --> 38:57.440
<i>He'd squeeze the balls so hard</i>
<i>that the brain would burst</i>

38:57.520 --> 38:59.960
<i>and the person would be dead in minutes.</i>

39:00.600 --> 39:03.920
<i>Salim Kaka had done this 14 times.</i>
<i>Mathu was petrified.</i>

39:04.400 --> 39:07.880
<i>So was I, but I had made up my mind.</i>

39:09.440 --> 39:12.720
You want to be brave, go ahead. I won't.

39:18.960 --> 39:20.640
You told me to be brave.

39:25.440 --> 39:30.400
This box has so much money,
you'll never have to sell Mandrax again.

39:31.120 --> 39:33.520
Do you even know what being brave means?

39:34.960 --> 39:38.520
Those six assholes over there
know what it means.

39:40.480 --> 39:41.840
But will they do it?

39:46.880 --> 39:48.480
You're out of your mind.

40:13.280 --> 40:14.320
Put it down.

41:27.040 --> 41:31.600
It's empty now, but it has killed
two people. Keep it safe. It's done.

41:31.680 --> 41:35.320
<i>Salim Kaka may have been a smuggler,</i>
<i>but he was actually a demon.</i>

41:35.400 --> 41:39.000
<i>My conscience told me</i>
<i>to free this fucker's soul.</i>

41:45.280 --> 41:47.760
<i>We had learned</i>
<i>the tricks of smuggling gold.</i>

41:47.840 --> 41:50.720
<i>Now Salim Kaka was of no use to us.</i>

42:07.960 --> 42:09.080
You!

42:11.440 --> 42:12.600
Motherfucker!

42:17.080 --> 42:19.160
Why did you throw it, motherfucker?

42:32.640 --> 42:34.160
Hit this motherfucker!

42:40.600 --> 42:41.680
Motherfucker!

42:44.960 --> 42:46.000
Enough!

42:54.160 --> 42:55.120
Enough!

42:56.400 --> 42:57.520
Stop it, he's dead!

42:58.480 --> 42:59.760
<i>Everyone was scared.</i>

43:00.320 --> 43:04.000
<i>They looked at Salim Kaka's corpse</i>
<i>with utter disbelief.</i>

43:04.840 --> 43:06.560
<i>No one said anything to me.</i>

43:06.720 --> 43:08.880
<i>No one shot me. No one praised me.</i>

43:09.280 --> 43:10.760
<i>Does this happen to you?</i>

43:11.360 --> 43:15.840
<i>When you kill someone,</i>
<i>you visualize yourself as that person.</i>

43:16.360 --> 43:20.600
<i>I've seen myself</i>
<i>in every person I have killed.</i>

43:33.640 --> 43:36.000
Gaitonde, open the door!

43:36.600 --> 43:38.160
Your game will be over soon.

43:38.720 --> 43:40.040
<i>Don't do this, sir.</i>

43:40.800 --> 43:44.400
<i>My mind has never been so fucked up,</i>
<i>and I have more to tell.</i>

43:45.400 --> 43:47.480
We'll listen to the rest of it in jail.

43:48.040 --> 43:49.800
<i>There will be nothing left in 25 days.</i>

43:52.200 --> 43:54.000
Come on!

44:02.240 --> 44:03.760
-Harder!
-Harder!

44:08.600 --> 44:10.240
Raise the shovel and hit it!

44:13.160 --> 44:15.480
<i>Dilbagh Singh introduced me</i>
<i>to my third father.</i>

44:16.040 --> 44:17.080
Go!

44:18.320 --> 44:21.120
-What?
<i>-I called you up to return his favor.</i>

44:21.200 --> 44:23.760
Who did my father introduce you to? When?

44:26.040 --> 44:27.280
Gaitonde!

44:28.400 --> 44:29.520
What did you say?

45:42.200 --> 45:43.720
Come with me peacefully.

45:47.120 --> 45:49.280
Who did Dilbagh Singh introduce you to?

45:53.360 --> 45:54.560
Put the gun down!

46:51.960 --> 46:54.000
<i>It's not over yet, Mr. Sartaj.</i> <i>I told you, I am Ashwathama.</i>

47:00.080 --> 47:01.280
<i>I won't die.</i>

47:01.760 --> 47:05.440
<i>I'm not going anywhere</i>
<i>till the game is over.</i>

47:06.520 --> 47:08.160
<i>Come on, Mr. Sartaj.</i>

47:08.680 --> 47:11.040
<i>Now we'll be together when it destroys us.</i>

47:16.480 --> 47:17.360
Holy shit!

47:22.160 --> 47:23.480
Do you believe in God?
