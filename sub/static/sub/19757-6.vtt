00:13.556 --> 00:15.641
[Madeline] What was Elise
even doing up here?

00:15.724 --> 00:18.644
[Simone] Who knows?
She was terrified of heights.

00:18.727 --> 00:21.105
Wouldn't even take the top bunk
at summer camp.

00:21.189 --> 00:22.791
[Madeline]
Someone must've brought her up here.

00:22.815 --> 00:24.067
Someone she trusted.

00:24.150 --> 00:25.252
[Pastor Lewis] Whoever it was,

00:25.276 --> 00:28.154
he really... let her down.

00:28.237 --> 00:30.531
And cut! Good enough. Thank you.

00:30.614 --> 00:32.158
All right, that is lunch, folks.

00:32.241 --> 00:34.285
But before you go
to get your carnitas, listen up.

00:34.368 --> 00:36.370
Can I get everybody
to gather around, please?

00:36.454 --> 00:39.248
Susan has some, uh,
important news she wants to share.

00:41.375 --> 00:43.336
- [Evan sighs]
- Is everything okay?

00:43.419 --> 00:45.963
Susan's just gonna announce
she's taking us all to Disneyland.

00:46.046 --> 00:47.131
Fuckin' idiot.

00:48.132 --> 00:49.800
Hi, everyone. Uh...

00:51.177 --> 00:52.886
Look, I'm just gonna, uh, get right to it.

00:52.970 --> 00:56.224
Um, this morning I was told
that the network

00:56.307 --> 00:58.309
is cutting <i>Witchita's</i> episode order.

00:58.392 --> 00:59.810
[all exclaiming]

00:59.893 --> 01:02.355
Yeah, they cut us from 16 to 12,

01:02.438 --> 01:04.498
which means the episode
that we're shooting right now

01:04.522 --> 01:06.400
will be the last of the season.

01:06.484 --> 01:09.778
And tomorrow will be
our last day of production.

01:09.862 --> 01:12.406
Why is this happening, Susan?
Did they say something?

01:12.490 --> 01:15.243
Are they just gonna put on
another fuckin' reality show?

01:15.326 --> 01:19.372
Gina said it was due to low numbers
and they have a mid-season replacement

01:19.455 --> 01:22.375
with Calista Flockhart playing
some park ranger detective

01:22.458 --> 01:24.210
that's fuckin' testing through the roof.

01:24.293 --> 01:27.963
But... [takes deep breath]
listen, guys, this is not a cancellation.

01:28.964 --> 01:31.509
It's a forced hiatus, and we will survive.

01:31.592 --> 01:33.927
Okay? Let's hold out hope
for another season.

01:35.304 --> 01:38.849
I mean, <i>Witchita,</i> you know,
we're more than a TV show.

01:39.475 --> 01:42.102
[crying] We're a family, right?

01:42.186 --> 01:43.312
Fuck! [chuckles]

01:43.396 --> 01:45.523
Fuck, I'm fucking crying over <i>Witchita.</i>

01:45.606 --> 01:46.649
Shit.

01:49.652 --> 01:52.780
So what's this mean?
We canceled, or...

01:52.863 --> 01:55.491
Let me put it this way.
I've been on three different shows,

01:55.574 --> 01:58.244
- all of them had their orders cut.
- [Rebecca] And what happened?

01:59.036 --> 02:01.289
[breath whooshes] All of them.

02:01.372 --> 02:04.125
So this could be, like,
the last episode of <i>Witchita</i> ever?

02:05.042 --> 02:08.170
- I mean, maybe I wrote the series finale.
- [Ali] Are you smiling?

02:08.253 --> 02:11.006
This isn't a birthday party.
It's a funeral.

02:11.089 --> 02:13.884
It's not a happy smile.
It's, like, a nervous smile.

02:13.967 --> 02:15.687
When I found out my grandma died,
I laughed.

02:15.719 --> 02:16.845
Fuck!

02:18.597 --> 02:21.392
[sighs] Just bought a fucking Tesla!

02:21.475 --> 02:22.643
Now I'm fucked!

02:23.686 --> 02:24.812
[grunting] Fuck!

02:24.895 --> 02:25.896
[Bertie] <i>Randy...</i>

02:25.979 --> 02:28.357
Mona... M-O-N-A-U?

02:28.441 --> 02:31.277
Monahan. M-O-N-A-H-A-N.

02:31.360 --> 02:32.361
Oh.

02:35.239 --> 02:38.242
Wow.
This is amazing.

02:38.326 --> 02:40.453
I'll totally pay you back at some point.
I swear.

02:40.536 --> 02:41.930
I'm impressed you can ask for help.

02:41.954 --> 02:43.164
Most guys couldn't do that.

02:43.747 --> 02:45.374
Oh, wait, you forgot to sign it.

02:45.458 --> 02:48.336
- Oh, my God. So stupid. Sorry.
- [chuckles]

02:48.419 --> 02:50.671
- You gotta sign it or I can't cash it.
- Mmm-hmm.

02:53.006 --> 02:55.259
- Thank you, Bertie.
- You're welcome.

03:05.644 --> 03:07.646
[theme music playing]

03:31.086 --> 03:32.630
Hey, what are you doing here?

03:33.088 --> 03:35.132
- Hanging with Bertie.
- Oh, yeah?

03:36.049 --> 03:38.219
Well, I think it's time to wrap this up

03:38.302 --> 03:40.513
'cause Bertie and I have
a whole mall day planned.

03:40.596 --> 03:42.848
We went a little overboard
at the store at Topanga,

03:42.931 --> 03:44.642
and now we gotta return all this stuff.

03:44.725 --> 03:46.769
Oh. I love that place.
Their dining terrace rules.

03:46.852 --> 03:49.062
- Don't you mean food court?
- Uh, no.

03:49.146 --> 03:52.149
At Topanga, it's a dining terrace.
It's super classy.

03:54.693 --> 03:56.695
Look, I don't mean to pry, but...

03:57.905 --> 03:59.865
don't you have a job
that you should be at?

04:00.574 --> 04:01.575
No.

04:01.659 --> 04:04.328
- Don't you?
- Yeah, and I took a mental health day.

04:04.412 --> 04:07.173
It's like a sick day, but everybody's
too afraid to ask what happened.

04:07.205 --> 04:09.166
So are you on unemployment?

04:09.250 --> 04:10.293
No. I tried to get that,

04:10.376 --> 04:12.896
but it turns out you had to have
had a job before you can get it.

04:12.920 --> 04:14.463
So you've never had a job?

04:14.547 --> 04:17.048
I washed some blankets
at this mosque for a little while.

04:17.132 --> 04:18.466
Do you come from money?

04:18.551 --> 04:21.053
- What does that mean?
- All righty, I'm ready, Freddy.

04:21.136 --> 04:22.638
Oh, Randy, you're still here?

04:22.721 --> 04:25.098
We're gonna head to the mall.
Do you wanna tag along?

04:25.182 --> 04:26.350
I've already got my shoes on.

04:26.434 --> 04:28.477
Great. Girls' day plus Randy.

04:37.778 --> 04:38.946
- [Arya grunts]
- [Gus] Uh.

04:39.029 --> 04:41.824
- Uh-huh.
- Oh, wait, wait, wait. It gets worse.

04:41.907 --> 04:44.076
Arya, we should probably get back
to class now.

04:44.159 --> 04:45.869
Wait, come on.
Just watch, watch, watch.

04:45.953 --> 04:48.289
- [door opens]
- Hey, Arya. There you are.

04:48.372 --> 04:50.666
- Oh! Hey, Steven.
- Hey.

04:50.749 --> 04:52.436
- How's it goin'? Denise.
- [Steven] Good to see you.

04:52.460 --> 04:53.461
Hello.

04:53.544 --> 04:55.212
Dad, I didn't know you were coming today.

04:55.296 --> 04:58.674
I know. But we have sort of
an important decision to make,

04:58.757 --> 05:00.551
and your mom usually handles this stuff,

05:00.634 --> 05:04.347
but she agreed we should have
a good team meeting about it.

05:04.430 --> 05:05.473
Hi, babe.

05:05.556 --> 05:07.876
Hey, do you think maybe we could do,
like, the team meeting

05:07.933 --> 05:09.602
in 15, 20 minutes, or...

05:09.685 --> 05:11.395
Could we just not do it at all?

05:11.479 --> 05:13.647
[chuckles]
No, we gotta do it right now, hon.

05:13.731 --> 05:15.608
You know, this new hiatus you have

05:15.691 --> 05:17.693
opens up some really, really
cool opportunities,

05:17.776 --> 05:21.071
and your mom and I just disagree
on which one's the best.

05:21.154 --> 05:24.742
Yeah, okay, take your time. I'll, uh...
I'll just be back here. Just ignore me.

05:24.825 --> 05:25.868
Thank you.

05:28.037 --> 05:29.079
Arya...

05:29.622 --> 05:32.333
I like <i>Liberty Down.</i>
Isn't that a cool name?

05:32.416 --> 05:34.627
It's a big-budget action movie.

05:34.710 --> 05:36.169
From the people that did <i>Taken.</i>

05:36.253 --> 05:38.607
- They're already planning on franchising...
- Okay, I get it.

05:38.631 --> 05:41.049
Sam already told me.
But how many weeks would they need me?

05:41.133 --> 05:42.968
Three weeks.
Maybe four.

05:43.051 --> 05:44.678
Shoots down in Atlanta.

05:44.762 --> 05:47.699
The president's daughter gets abducted,
and you play the president's daughter.

05:47.723 --> 05:50.267
Wow, Arya. That's very cool.

05:50.351 --> 05:52.394
A big movie. Proud of ya.

05:52.478 --> 05:55.022
And, uh, Mom, I'm guessing
you want me to do the indie one?

05:55.105 --> 05:58.025
I do. I think <i>Lowlands</i>
is a better move for you.

05:58.108 --> 06:00.653
It's about a girl
whose mother is mentally ill.

06:00.736 --> 06:03.739
They're stranded in a snowstorm
without any medicine.

06:03.822 --> 06:06.366
And, Arya, the script made me cry.

06:06.450 --> 06:08.344
- You cry at GEICO commercials.
- [Denise] Steven.

06:08.368 --> 06:11.163
Baby, this is an Oscar nom if you do well.

06:11.246 --> 06:14.374
And, Arya, you would kill this role.

06:14.458 --> 06:17.878
<i>Liberty Down</i> is a great movie.
It's gonna be on 4,000 screens.

06:17.961 --> 06:20.213
<i>Lowlands</i> will be on one screen
in La Mirada.

06:20.297 --> 06:22.442
Your friends can't get there
unless their parents drive them.

06:22.466 --> 06:24.944
- You're gonna be amazing... in <i>Lowlands.</i>
- You're a great little actress...

06:24.968 --> 06:26.303
and you just pick one,

06:26.386 --> 06:27.864
- and we'll be behind you.
- You'll be the star.

06:27.888 --> 06:29.264
[cell phone chimes]

06:29.347 --> 06:30.348
Oh.

06:30.433 --> 06:34.687
Arya, they want you back on set,
so we should probably get going.

06:34.770 --> 06:36.354
Okay, we'll figure this out later.

06:36.439 --> 06:37.523
- Scoot.
- Okay.

06:37.606 --> 06:38.732
[Gus] All right.

06:38.816 --> 06:39.936
[Denise] You look beautiful.

06:41.276 --> 06:42.956
Do you think they have breakfast burritos?

06:44.112 --> 06:45.448
Fuck you. I'm hungry.

06:48.784 --> 06:52.996
All right, we're here,
and the store we need to go to is here.

06:53.080 --> 06:55.248
Fuck. We parked on the wrong end.

06:55.332 --> 06:56.959
Oh, well, silver lining,

06:57.042 --> 07:00.212
now we get to go see
the sights and sounds of Topanga.

07:02.047 --> 07:04.467
Yeah, I need to make a pit stop
before we do the schlep.

07:04.550 --> 07:05.551
Okay.

07:06.760 --> 07:08.637
- Randy, we're peeing.
- Okay.

07:09.972 --> 07:11.181
Do these make me look cool?

07:13.100 --> 07:14.184
How about these?

07:15.894 --> 07:17.622
- [toilet flushing]
- [Bertie] One of my goals is to take

07:17.646 --> 07:20.649
a more active role in decorating
our apartment, if that's cool with you.

07:20.733 --> 07:24.236
Oh, yeah.
I mean, <i>mi casa es su casa.</i>

07:24.319 --> 07:27.906
It's kind of Randy's <i>casa</i> now too, huh?
Since he's there all the time.

07:27.990 --> 07:30.534
How's it going with you guys?
Is it getting serious?

07:30.618 --> 07:31.952
I don't know. Maybe.

07:32.035 --> 07:35.413
I'm trying not to think about it.
I just really wanna live in the moment,

07:35.498 --> 07:38.166
not think about the future at all.
Eckhart Tolle kind of thing.

07:38.250 --> 07:40.418
But wasn't he a little scary
when he was on shrooms

07:40.503 --> 07:42.212
and he kept talking about killing people?

07:42.295 --> 07:45.466
Yeah. But then the next day,
he was just sweet, cuddly Randy again.

07:45.549 --> 07:48.301
So... yeah, I blame the mushrooms.

07:48.385 --> 07:50.804
Okay. And you like him?

07:51.304 --> 07:53.766
Yeah. I love that he's so kind.

07:53.849 --> 07:57.728
And he has lot of free time, which is nice
at the beginning of a relationship.

07:57.811 --> 08:00.856
And I just like
that he likes being around me.

08:01.440 --> 08:03.525
Mmm-hmm. Yeah.

08:03.609 --> 08:06.449
Don't you wish you were with somebody
who could take care of themselves?

08:06.529 --> 08:07.946
I mean, so many guys...

08:08.030 --> 08:10.030
What makes you think
he can't take care of himself?

08:11.074 --> 08:15.203
So, like, you and Gus are going well,
and now you're a relationship expert?

08:16.038 --> 08:17.623
[sighs] Forget I said anything.

08:22.419 --> 08:24.588
Parfait? Parfait, anybody?

08:24.672 --> 08:28.133
Parfait. Fresh banana.
Fruit. Kiwi. Berries.

08:28.216 --> 08:29.760
Treats by Kev. Just google it.

08:29.843 --> 08:31.445
I'm the man for any
of your catering needs.

08:31.469 --> 08:33.639
Anybody pregnant? I kill baby showers.

08:33.722 --> 08:35.182
Kevin, look at you!

08:35.265 --> 08:37.350
- Back to the hustle, huh?
- Dude, I gotta.

08:37.433 --> 08:39.520
How else am I gonna leave
a good impression?

08:39.602 --> 08:40.979
- I know. I know.
- What about you?

08:41.063 --> 08:42.499
Shouldn't you be
sniffing around for another gig?

08:42.523 --> 08:45.067
Oh. No, no, no, no. I, uh...

08:45.651 --> 08:47.331
I think I know
what my next job's gonna be.

08:47.360 --> 08:51.281
Arya's got a couple of movie offers,
so... knock on wood. [chuckles]

08:51.365 --> 08:52.199
God damn it, man.

08:52.282 --> 08:54.576
I wish I had a nice little white girl
to hang out with.

08:54.660 --> 08:57.538
Well, everybody needs
a little white girl, right?

08:58.539 --> 09:01.458
I don't know.
I don't necessarily mean that.

09:01.542 --> 09:03.669
- Hey. Hey, guys.
- Hey.

09:03.752 --> 09:05.838
- Hey, can I talk to you for one second?
- Yeah.

09:05.921 --> 09:07.089
Sure. Totally.

09:07.172 --> 09:09.299
By the way, these things are unreal.
They're great.

09:09.382 --> 09:11.218
Dude, spread the word.
Treats by Kev, bro.

09:11.301 --> 09:13.220
- Thank you. Let everybody know.
- [chuckles]

09:13.303 --> 09:14.638
- All right, man.
- Thank you.

09:15.347 --> 09:20.561
I hope this isn't weird, but, uh...
did I see you in an episode of <i>Homicide?</i>

09:20.644 --> 09:21.854
It was, like, Season 4.

09:21.937 --> 09:23.832
- At the wedding.
- The one where the guy got arrested

09:23.856 --> 09:25.190
- at his wedding.
- Yeah. Yeah.

09:25.273 --> 09:27.943
- Oh, you were great. Yeah.
- Oh, man, thank you. That's great.

09:28.026 --> 09:30.195
You know, I never wanted Arya
to be an actor.

09:30.278 --> 09:32.114
Really? She's so good.

09:32.197 --> 09:33.531
Oh, she's fucking great.

09:33.616 --> 09:36.577
But even if you're great, are you really
gonna be the next Meryl Streep?

09:36.660 --> 09:38.245
- I mean, what are the chances?
- Yeah.

09:39.287 --> 09:42.540
Spend her days like all of us,
out there getting rejected

09:42.625 --> 09:45.377
and holding out hope
for that one big payday.

09:46.294 --> 09:48.797
Then <i>Liberty Down</i> falls in her lap.
It's, like, a franchise.

09:48.881 --> 09:50.883
- I don't... I don't know.
- I know. It's so cool.

09:50.966 --> 09:52.009
It's crazy.

09:52.092 --> 09:54.386
She does one movie, works for a decade.

09:54.469 --> 09:56.346
She could pay her way through college.

09:57.222 --> 09:59.642
- Yeah. I didn't realize.
- Yeah.

10:00.934 --> 10:02.894
Denise doesn't think like that either.

10:03.311 --> 10:05.522
- Can you sit down for a sec?
- Yeah.

10:06.106 --> 10:08.191
[grunting]

10:10.110 --> 10:11.361
I, uh...

10:12.696 --> 10:14.865
I don't think anybody knows this,
but, um...

10:15.908 --> 10:17.117
we're getting a divorce.

10:17.200 --> 10:18.661
- Oh...
- Yeah.

10:18.744 --> 10:22.039
Jeez, man, that... that sucks.
I'm... I'm sorry to hear that.

10:22.623 --> 10:26.543
I just get a little worried that I won't
have any say in my daughter's future.

10:26.627 --> 10:27.628
Mmm-hmm.

10:27.711 --> 10:29.546
You're on set with Denise. You get it.

10:29.630 --> 10:31.006
- Oh, yeah.
- Yeah.

10:31.089 --> 10:32.257
She can be intimidating.

10:32.341 --> 10:33.341
Yeah, she's a cunt.

10:34.509 --> 10:36.887
You've only done one season with her.
I've done 14.

10:36.970 --> 10:38.722
[chuckles] Yeah.

10:38.806 --> 10:39.973
- It's brutal.
- Yeah.

10:40.057 --> 10:42.100
But poor Arya. You know what I mean?

10:42.685 --> 10:44.978
Her show gets shit-canned, uh...

10:45.062 --> 10:48.023
Her parents are getting a divorce.
That's a drag.

10:48.106 --> 10:50.233
Well, hey, if there's anything
I can do to help,

10:50.317 --> 10:52.610
or whatever, you know, I'm here.

10:53.236 --> 10:56.740
Just talk to her.
Be a good influence.

10:56.824 --> 10:58.867
- She likes you. She says she likes you.
- Yeah?

10:58.951 --> 11:00.828
- Yeah.
- Aw, that's sweet.

11:00.911 --> 11:03.246
And I think we both agree
that <i>Liberty Down</i>

11:03.330 --> 11:05.165
is probably the best move
for her right now.

11:05.791 --> 11:08.376
Yeah. All right, I'm gonna scoot.

11:08.460 --> 11:09.920
- [sighs]
- Oh, okay.

11:11.922 --> 11:13.548
Can I give you this?

11:13.631 --> 11:15.258
- Sure.
- Thanks.

11:16.509 --> 11:18.345
[cell phone vibrating]

11:20.680 --> 11:22.474
Hello? Cynthia?

11:22.557 --> 11:23.683
It's Cynthia from work.

11:23.767 --> 11:26.144
Cynthia, can you hear me?
I'm in a mall.

11:26.728 --> 11:27.854
A mall!

11:27.938 --> 11:31.066
Did you know that the people who build
malls put the escalators at either end

11:31.149 --> 11:33.944
so that you got to walk
by all the shops to get to 'em?

11:34.027 --> 11:36.905
- You know a lot about malls.
- [Bertie] Oh, no. Really?

11:36.989 --> 11:38.824
Yeah.
Malls and casinos.

11:38.907 --> 11:41.409
You guys, I'm so sorry,
but I'm gonna have to go in to work.

11:41.493 --> 11:42.494
Right now?

11:42.577 --> 11:45.247
Yeah, well, Cynthia... Cynthia's
from work, and she's got the flu,

11:45.330 --> 11:48.166
and she was meant to be running
a microwave popcorn focus group today,

11:48.250 --> 11:50.127
but now I'm gonna have
to go cover for her.

11:50.210 --> 11:51.628
- Crap.
- [Randy] Go.

11:51.711 --> 11:54.047
- Mickey and I can do the returns.
- Really?

11:54.131 --> 11:57.217
- You'd do that for me?
- Of course. Anything for Bertie.

11:58.635 --> 11:59.886
You okay with that, Mickey?

12:00.929 --> 12:04.099
Yeah. I'm just wondering
how we're gonna get back without your car.

12:04.182 --> 12:06.894
We can Uber.
You have an account, right, Mickey?

12:06.977 --> 12:08.103
Um...

12:09.354 --> 12:11.189
- Yeah...
- [Bertie] Okay, great!

12:11.273 --> 12:14.192
I think this will be good.
You two are gonna have fun together.

12:14.276 --> 12:15.443
Okay.

12:15.527 --> 12:17.112
Sorry. Thank you.

12:17.195 --> 12:18.321
See ya.

12:21.366 --> 12:22.367
Bye!

12:23.410 --> 12:24.661
Bye, Bertie.

12:26.163 --> 12:28.331
- You wanna get something to eat?
- No.

12:28.415 --> 12:30.708
How about, like, a pretzel or something?
Something quick.

12:30.793 --> 12:32.753
- [cashier] And you're all set.
- [Mickey] Thanks.

12:32.836 --> 12:35.005
My roommate and I
went a little crazy the other day.

12:39.092 --> 12:40.468
[sighs] Cool, right?

12:40.552 --> 12:42.679
What are you gonna do
with a filing cabinet?

12:42.762 --> 12:44.222
You can put anything in there.

12:44.306 --> 12:48.560
You can put clothes and paper and food,
if you want. And it's really cute.

12:48.643 --> 12:50.896
[cashier] That'll be $39.99.

12:50.979 --> 12:52.022
Oh!

12:53.690 --> 12:55.376
- [Randy] Thanks.
- [cashier] Debit or credit?

12:55.400 --> 12:57.796
[Randy] Credit, please.
It's my first real piece of furniture.

12:57.820 --> 13:00.030
- And you're all set.
- [Randy] Thanks so much.

13:00.113 --> 13:03.491
I think I'm gonna put it
right in my living room.

13:03.575 --> 13:04.952
It looks like R2-D2.

13:05.035 --> 13:06.453
- [imitating R2-D2]
- [Mickey] No.

13:08.914 --> 13:10.707
- Arya?
- Gus!

13:11.834 --> 13:13.210
- Oh. Hey.
- Hey.

13:13.293 --> 13:15.646
- Arya's not here.
- Okay, I'll just... I'll come back later.

13:15.670 --> 13:17.130
Uh, no, no, no. Nope, come here.

13:17.214 --> 13:19.632
- I need to talk to you for a second.
- All right. Okay.

13:20.758 --> 13:21.969
- Look...
- What's up?

13:22.052 --> 13:25.472
I am really sorry about all that craziness
that you witnessed this morning.

13:25.555 --> 13:27.140
- That was... You know.
- Oh...

13:27.224 --> 13:30.018
No, that's okay.
I understand how that stuff goes.

13:30.102 --> 13:34.439
And I think you should finally know
that Steve and I are splitting up.

13:35.523 --> 13:37.860
- Oh. I'm sorry to hear that.
- Yeah.

13:37.943 --> 13:39.545
- No, well...
- [stammers] That's a shame.

13:39.569 --> 13:41.129
I mean, we were not really a great fit.

13:41.196 --> 13:43.907
Ahh, no, I feel like you guys,
you know, started dating,

13:43.991 --> 13:45.533
you got married, right?

13:45.617 --> 13:47.744
Come on, we were young.
We were having a great time.

13:47.827 --> 13:48.912
The sex was...

13:48.996 --> 13:52.832
Oh, well, we don't need
to get into all that...

13:52.916 --> 13:54.084
- Yeah, well...
- right now.

13:54.167 --> 13:56.253
every time that I tried
to break up with him...

13:56.336 --> 13:58.838
- Mmm-hmm?
- [sighs] ...he would get me so...

13:59.756 --> 14:00.756
I mean...

14:01.549 --> 14:03.801
you know, like, hard.

14:03.886 --> 14:06.721
- And it was... I mean...
- Mmm. Mmm-hmm. Mmm.

14:06.804 --> 14:08.473
- Mmm-hmm.
- beyond.

14:08.556 --> 14:10.517
- Yeah. No, that's romantic.
- And he still does.

14:10.600 --> 14:12.310
- [chuckles]
- Oh. That's sweet.

14:12.394 --> 14:14.396
But everything else
is a fucking nightmare.

14:14.479 --> 14:16.481
- Mmm-hmm.
- I mean, you cannot raise a child

14:16.564 --> 14:17.774
with a man like that.

14:17.857 --> 14:19.609
- You know? No.
- I imagine not. Uh...

14:19.692 --> 14:21.444
So do you know where Arya went, or...

14:21.528 --> 14:23.989
Oh, please don't tell Arya anything, okay?

14:24.072 --> 14:25.365
- Oh.
- She doesn't know anything

14:25.448 --> 14:26.800
- about the divorce yet.
- No, don't...

14:26.824 --> 14:28.744
- Not a word. Okay.
- Yeah, I won't say anything.

14:28.826 --> 14:30.662
I have a favor.

14:30.745 --> 14:31.788
All right.

14:31.872 --> 14:33.874
- <i>Lowlands.</i>
- Okay.

14:34.791 --> 14:37.835
- <i>Liberty Down.</i>
- Ah. All right.

14:37.920 --> 14:40.005
So Arya trusts you.

14:40.088 --> 14:42.549
- Mmm.
- I want you to read both of those

14:42.632 --> 14:45.343
and just let Arya know what you think.

14:45.427 --> 14:47.387
I think you'll see what I mean.

14:47.470 --> 14:48.513
Yeah.

14:48.596 --> 14:50.723
Um, okay. I just...

14:50.807 --> 14:52.893
I'm a little worried
it's a busy day today.

14:52.976 --> 14:54.203
The last day of production and all.

14:54.227 --> 14:57.189
So I don't know if I can dig into these,
like, right now. But...

14:57.272 --> 14:58.856
- Gus?
- Mmm-hmm?

14:58.941 --> 15:01.526
You can do this for me.
For us.

15:02.444 --> 15:04.446
Okay, uh...

15:04.529 --> 15:06.489
Yeah. No, I... Let me get at it.
I'd be happy to.

15:06.573 --> 15:08.200
- Good. Yes, thank you.
- It'll be great.

15:08.283 --> 15:09.576
- Great.
- Okay.

15:12.079 --> 15:14.998
[sighs] There it is.
The dining terrace. Let's go.

15:15.082 --> 15:19.044
No. Dude, I'm hungry, too,
but I'm so tired. I want to go home.

15:19.127 --> 15:21.838
My blood sugar's low.
I... I really need to eat right now.

15:21.922 --> 15:23.881
- It's bad if I don't eat.
- Can we eat at home?

15:23.966 --> 15:25.092
It's cheaper anyway.

15:25.175 --> 15:27.385
[sighs] I hate home food.

15:27.469 --> 15:29.054
What? That's normal.

15:29.137 --> 15:32.390
Now who's gonna pay for this
dining terrace food, by the way?

15:32.474 --> 15:34.059
- I am.
- Oh, really?

15:34.142 --> 15:36.769
Or is Bertie?
'Cause I know that she lent you money.

15:37.812 --> 15:41.024
- She told you that?
- No. I saw it. Or I heard it.

15:42.192 --> 15:44.902
Dude, you're in my house.
You're always in my fuckin' house.

15:44.987 --> 15:46.321
How much money did she give you?

15:48.073 --> 15:49.074
How much?

15:50.033 --> 15:51.784
$850. It's for my rent.

15:51.868 --> 15:53.370
$850?

15:53.453 --> 15:55.413
I thought she gave you, like, 100 bucks.

15:55.497 --> 15:58.250
And you took it?
What the fuck's wrong with you?

15:58.333 --> 15:59.376
Nothing's wrong with me.

15:59.459 --> 16:01.753
Really? 'Cause you're 30,
and you don't have a job.

16:01.836 --> 16:04.922
Bertie just got here from Australia,
and now you're gonna bleed her dry?

16:05.007 --> 16:06.841
- No, I'm not.
- Really?

16:06.924 --> 16:08.426
I like Bertie.
She's my friend.

16:08.510 --> 16:10.553
Well, you're runnin' a nice scam
on her right now.

16:10.637 --> 16:13.681
- It's not a fuckin' scam, Mickey.
- It is a scam.

16:13.765 --> 16:15.076
And I know it 'cause I've done it.

16:15.100 --> 16:17.185
You don't think I've gotten guys
to pay my rent?

16:17.269 --> 16:20.022
I dated one dude, I got him to buy me
all these expensive clothes.

16:20.105 --> 16:22.145
I'd just e-mail him links,
and he'd buy me the shit.

16:22.190 --> 16:24.484
Well, it's not my fault, okay?

16:24.567 --> 16:27.779
I get these little side jobs, but it's
hard to hold down a job full-time.

16:27.862 --> 16:30.240
And there's no jobs left
in this fucking country anyway.

16:30.323 --> 16:31.741
Ask anybody here!

16:31.824 --> 16:36.288
Oh, really? 'Cause that person has a job.
Job, job, job, job, job!

16:36.371 --> 16:39.457
You're literally surrounded by jobs.
What's your excuse?

16:39.541 --> 16:41.584
- Fine!
- Where are you going?

16:43.045 --> 16:44.171
I'm gonna go get a job,

16:44.254 --> 16:46.714
because it's so freakin' easy
to get, right?

16:46.798 --> 16:48.425
Yeah, it is.

16:48.508 --> 16:50.510
You look so stupid wheeling that thing.

16:59.352 --> 17:01.312
Hey. Can I help you?

17:01.396 --> 17:02.814
Yeah, cool store.

17:02.897 --> 17:04.482
I like the stuff you guys sell here.

17:04.566 --> 17:08.528
It's, uh, very sophisticated.
Uh, so are you guys, like, hiring?

17:08.611 --> 17:11.073
Oh, not right now.
We just hired someone, so...

17:11.156 --> 17:13.366
Guess you're out of luck.
Can we go, please?

17:13.450 --> 17:14.951
Can I talk to a manager or something?

17:15.035 --> 17:17.537
I'd really like to have a job today,
if possible.

17:17.619 --> 17:19.955
Yeah, sorry. Um, the manager's not here.
[chuckles]

17:20.040 --> 17:22.834
Okay, but she says
that there are jobs everywhere.

17:22.916 --> 17:25.212
And, uh, you know,
I know a lot about selling stuff,

17:25.295 --> 17:26.421
and I'm a great team player.

17:26.503 --> 17:28.089
Do you have any retail experience?

17:28.173 --> 17:30.342
I sell my plasma sometimes, so...

17:30.425 --> 17:31.718
Yeah, that doesn't count.

17:31.801 --> 17:35.263
Um, this job is about, um, personality.

17:35.347 --> 17:37.307
[scoffs] Well,
I have an awesome personality.

17:37.390 --> 17:38.766
People tell me that all the time.

17:38.850 --> 17:40.935
They say, "Randy,
your personality fuckin' rocks!"

17:41.018 --> 17:42.645
Okay. You made your point, all right?

17:42.729 --> 17:44.522
Okay, can I just leave my e-mail
and my name?

17:44.606 --> 17:47.484
And then when a job opens up later,
you contact me and I come in.

17:47.567 --> 17:48.943
Uh, I don't think so, man. Sorry.

17:49.026 --> 17:51.466
Please. I can sell these little
funeral clothes to kids, okay?

17:51.529 --> 17:53.549
It's not for funerals.
Kids don't wear these to funerals.

17:53.573 --> 17:56.733
Then what do they wear these clothes for?
To get beat the shit out of in school?

17:56.785 --> 17:57.785
Please leave.

17:58.203 --> 17:59.662
- Oh, my God!
- Whoa. Come on, dude.

17:59.746 --> 18:01.140
- Oh, dude. Come on.
- We'll go when I'm ready.

18:01.164 --> 18:03.351
- What are you doing?
- I hate this store and I hate you.

18:03.375 --> 18:04.935
You know how long it takes
to arrange those things?

18:04.959 --> 18:06.503
No, because I don't fuckin' work here!

18:06.586 --> 18:08.045
[Mickey] We're going! Come on!

18:08.130 --> 18:09.589
You're gonna regret this, man.

18:09.672 --> 18:12.049
You're gonna regret
not hiring Randy Farquaad.

18:12.134 --> 18:13.426
I... Oh, come on, dude.

18:13.510 --> 18:15.071
- Now you showed him.
- Have fun picking it up.

18:15.095 --> 18:16.804
Don't tell him your name, you idiot!

18:16.888 --> 18:19.599
That's not my name.
It's the evil prince from <i>Shrek.</i>

18:24.396 --> 18:25.397
Yeah.

18:26.314 --> 18:28.108
No, I'm still here.

18:28.191 --> 18:29.234
No.

18:29.317 --> 18:30.860
I'm not wearing this dress.

18:30.943 --> 18:33.113
But you were wearing it
in the first part of the scene.

18:33.196 --> 18:34.447
The part we already shot.

18:34.531 --> 18:35.823
[Arya] It makes me look old.

18:35.907 --> 18:38.034
- Why can't I just wear that one?
- That's Heidi's.

18:38.118 --> 18:41.163
Well, uh, her character's dead.
Why can't it just be mine?

18:41.246 --> 18:42.747
No, Arya, it can't be yours.

18:42.830 --> 18:45.875
Now, listen, you know how this works.
It's a continuity thing.

18:45.958 --> 18:47.294
I'm not putting it on.

18:47.377 --> 18:50.057
You're gonna put that dress on.
You're gonna shoot your final scene.

18:50.087 --> 18:51.732
You're gonna rock it.
And then once you're done,

18:51.756 --> 18:54.384
you can just go off
and do whatever you want. Okay?

18:55.218 --> 18:56.428
[whispers] I hate this place.

18:56.511 --> 18:58.831
- [Gus] Sorry about them cutting the order.
- Don't even...

18:59.806 --> 19:00.807
Hey, Arya.

19:01.891 --> 19:03.601
You decided what movie you wanna do?

19:04.101 --> 19:05.395
Nope. [sighs]

19:06.813 --> 19:07.855
See, now...

19:08.565 --> 19:11.901
I was flipping through these scripts,
and I gotta say <i>Lowlands</i> is pretty good.

19:11.984 --> 19:13.820
Are you kidding me?
They're both awful.

19:13.903 --> 19:17.031
One's a mindless action movie,
and one's a derivative indie.

19:17.114 --> 19:18.616
They both suck my ass.

19:18.700 --> 19:21.786
All right. That's...
an astute way of putting it.

19:21.869 --> 19:24.206
I was just reading them,
you know, 'cause...

19:24.289 --> 19:28.125
I don't know. I'm worried about you
with <i>Witchita</i> ending, right?

19:28.210 --> 19:29.586
You must be freaked out.

19:29.669 --> 19:32.964
I could not care less.
I've always hated it here.

19:34.299 --> 19:37.844
- Well, what would you wanna do next?
- I don't know.

19:37.927 --> 19:41.556
Be a normal kid.
Go to school. Have a boyfriend.

19:41.639 --> 19:43.225
I should be smoking and making out,

19:43.308 --> 19:45.977
not standing here
with a bunch of 50-year-olds all day.

19:46.060 --> 19:47.604
[Evan] Hey, Arya.

19:47.687 --> 19:49.272
Like him.

19:49.356 --> 19:50.648
Why do I know him?

19:52.192 --> 19:55.027
Okay. I see where you're coming from.

19:55.111 --> 19:56.988
I get how it'd be a bummer for you, okay?

19:58.531 --> 19:59.741
Nobody cares what I think.

19:59.824 --> 20:03.453
Hey, I care what you feel, okay?
Don't say that.

20:03.536 --> 20:04.537
No, you don't.

20:04.621 --> 20:06.414
You just want me to work
so you have a job.

20:06.498 --> 20:09.417
Hey, I could get a job without you, okay?

20:09.501 --> 20:13.546
I just prefer to have a job with you,
'cause you're cool, all right?

20:14.130 --> 20:16.758
But you should do what you want, okay?

20:16.841 --> 20:19.344
Whatever you decide,
I'll... I'll support you.

20:19.427 --> 20:22.889
Well, if I don't support my parents,
they're gonna go bankrupt.

20:22.972 --> 20:24.516
They're always fighting about money.

20:24.599 --> 20:26.476
Well, your parents can be a little cuckoo,

20:26.559 --> 20:29.396
but... if you told them
what you just told me,

20:29.479 --> 20:31.022
they'd be cool with it.
Promise.

20:31.105 --> 20:32.274
Or...

20:33.566 --> 20:34.776
you could tell them.

20:35.485 --> 20:37.445
I don't know,
'cause I kind of feel like

20:37.529 --> 20:40.031
if you did it,
it'd be a good learning experience.

20:40.114 --> 20:42.954
You'd learn how to fight your own battles.
I don't need that experience.

20:43.034 --> 20:45.495
Come on, I'm paying you.
You can do at least one thing.

20:46.203 --> 20:47.372
Besides educate you?

20:47.997 --> 20:49.958
Well, that's obviously not working.

21:51.519 --> 21:54.439
So, uh... I know why you don't like me.

21:54.522 --> 21:56.566
I... I know I'm pathetic.

21:56.649 --> 21:58.234
The thing is, I really like Bertie.

21:58.318 --> 22:00.236
She's so funny and hot...

22:01.153 --> 22:02.364
doesn't mind having me around.

22:03.239 --> 22:05.157
I think I borrowed money from her

22:05.241 --> 22:07.910
because I know I'm gonna
fuck things up sooner or later.

22:07.994 --> 22:10.538
So... might as well be sooner.

22:14.166 --> 22:15.377
Nah, dude.

22:17.169 --> 22:18.463
Me, too.

22:18.546 --> 22:21.173
I'm worried I'm gonna fuck up things
with Gus every single day.

22:22.675 --> 22:23.843
What if I fall off the wagon?

22:25.303 --> 22:28.765
Or I do something crazy?
Or I'm impulsive, or...

22:29.223 --> 22:32.519
I mean, he wants me to get better
so badly, but what if I can't?

22:32.602 --> 22:34.854
You know? I mean, I...
I fuck everything up.

22:34.937 --> 22:36.898
So why not Gus, too, right?

22:36.981 --> 22:39.692
Well... you never know.

22:41.235 --> 22:44.697
This time, maybe Gus does something
really dumb and ruins everything.

22:44.781 --> 22:45.823
[chuckles]

22:45.907 --> 22:48.618
- He can be a real idiot sometimes, so...
- That's true.

22:50.495 --> 22:51.746
Or maybe nobody will screw up,

22:51.829 --> 22:54.416
and you guys will be happy
for a long time.

22:54.999 --> 22:56.459
- It could happen.
- That'd be cool.

23:06.177 --> 23:07.929
Here. You...
you can give this back to her.

23:08.012 --> 23:10.347
I... I don't deserve that.

23:14.018 --> 23:16.479
It's okay.
She wanted you to have it.

23:27.990 --> 23:29.468
[Steven] You won't let me
in her life.

23:29.492 --> 23:30.993
You don't let me in her account.

23:31.077 --> 23:32.328
I can't call her agent.

23:32.411 --> 23:33.455
- No.
- I'm not allowed.

23:33.538 --> 23:35.098
I am the one that does everything for her.

23:35.122 --> 23:36.517
[Steven] That still
doesn't answer the question.

23:36.541 --> 23:37.542
- I'm fine...
- [stammers]

23:37.625 --> 23:38.710
- Hey.
- Oh, my God.

23:38.793 --> 23:41.003
- Is it a good time?
- [Steven] Not really.

23:41.087 --> 23:42.254
Never is, right? [chuckles]

23:43.255 --> 23:45.091
Okay, so here's the thing.

23:45.174 --> 23:48.177
Um, talked about it with Arya,

23:48.260 --> 23:50.680
and we decided
that the best thing for her to do

23:50.763 --> 23:52.890
after <i>Witchita</i> is...

23:52.974 --> 23:53.974
[inhales]

23:54.726 --> 23:55.727
nothing.

23:55.810 --> 23:57.854
She doesn't want to do either movie.

23:57.937 --> 23:59.647
She just wants
to take a break from acting,

23:59.730 --> 24:02.900
and, um, you know,
I think she just wants to be a kid again.

24:03.860 --> 24:05.444
And maybe...

24:05.528 --> 24:09.824
it's sort of our job to do the right thing
and look out for her.

24:12.910 --> 24:15.580
Arya, is this something you really want?

24:15.663 --> 24:16.914
Yes.

24:18.541 --> 24:19.584
Okay, then.

24:20.502 --> 24:21.503
I'm okay with that.

24:21.586 --> 24:24.005
Great. Yeah, I think
this will be good for everybody.

24:24.088 --> 24:25.381
In fact, it's perfect.

24:25.464 --> 24:28.425
I mean, <i>Lowlands</i> doesn't start
shooting for another three weeks.

24:28.510 --> 24:30.553
We can... we can go to Hawaii.

24:30.637 --> 24:33.556
We can get mud baths,
get totally blissed out.

24:33.640 --> 24:35.576
And then you can come back,
and we'll be so relaxed.

24:35.600 --> 24:36.893
- And...
- Are you serious?

24:37.810 --> 24:39.311
- What?
- She's not doing <i>Lowlands!</i>

24:39.395 --> 24:41.773
She just said she doesn't want to work.
Are you stupid?

24:41.856 --> 24:43.650
The kid says, "I need a break,"

24:43.733 --> 24:45.317
and you come up with that shit?

24:45.401 --> 24:47.069
[Denise] You decide
to parent for one day

24:47.153 --> 24:50.782
- and you think you know what's best?
- Well, because you don't let me near her.

24:50.865 --> 24:52.009
Why don't you let me near her?

24:52.033 --> 24:54.911
Are you worried that I might see
all the scamming and scheming

24:54.994 --> 24:56.555
- as you steal all her money?
- Oh, no...

24:56.579 --> 24:58.330
God! Shut up!

24:58.414 --> 25:02.084
Stop! I know what's going on.
I know you're getting a divorce.

25:02.168 --> 25:03.502
God damn it, Gus. Really?

25:03.586 --> 25:05.046
Are you serious? He didn't tell me!

25:05.129 --> 25:08.382
I can hear you guys! I'm not stupid!

25:08.465 --> 25:10.051
I heard you. I heard both of you.

25:10.134 --> 25:11.385
[sighs]

25:11.468 --> 25:13.930
[stammers] Honey, listen.

25:14.013 --> 25:17.559
Obviously, we love you so much.
It's nothing to do with you.

25:17.642 --> 25:20.227
And if it were up to me,
I would have told you months ago.

25:20.311 --> 25:22.605
Oh, my God, are you really
trying to score points with...

25:22.689 --> 25:24.691
Will you shut up? Shut up!

25:24.774 --> 25:26.609
I don't even know
what we're arguing about.

25:26.693 --> 25:29.571
Just tell Sam that I'll do both.
We'll figure something out.

25:29.654 --> 25:32.949
You can come with me to <i>Liberty,</i>
and you can come with me to <i>Lowlands.</i>

25:33.032 --> 25:34.867
Okay? And Gus can come to both

25:34.951 --> 25:37.662
to teach me the stupid shit
I don't need to know.

25:37.745 --> 25:39.080
Are you satisfied?

25:41.373 --> 25:42.374
I'm cool with that.

25:42.458 --> 25:43.876
- [Denise] Fine.
- Done! Go!

25:53.928 --> 25:55.930
I guess you have two jobs now, dipshit.

26:00.559 --> 26:01.644
Thank you.

26:06.065 --> 26:08.359
- Bertie, Bertie, what's up?
- Hey, how are you?

26:08.442 --> 26:09.526
- How you doin'?
- I'm good.

26:09.611 --> 26:10.754
They stuck you with the popcorn?

26:10.778 --> 26:12.655
Yeah, the most boring possible thing,
right?

26:12.739 --> 26:14.115
- That sucks.
- What you got today?

26:14.198 --> 26:15.532
Um, juicers.

26:15.617 --> 26:16.784
So dumb.

26:16.868 --> 26:18.369
I thought you had the day off today.

26:18.452 --> 26:20.371
Oh, yeah, but Cynthia
asked me to cover for her.

26:20.454 --> 26:22.456
- She's got the flu.
- Cynthia?

26:22.539 --> 26:24.626
She just posted,
like, six pictures on Instagram

26:24.709 --> 26:26.460
from the Wizarding World of Harry Potter.

26:27.044 --> 26:30.673
Yeah, she ridin' rides,
playing Quidditch, drinkin' butterbeer.

26:30.757 --> 26:32.049
Oh, man, hold on.

26:32.133 --> 26:35.803
So you mean she's out there having fun,
and you're here stuck doing popcorn?

26:35.887 --> 26:38.681
Oh, man.
She took you for a ride.

26:39.682 --> 26:41.017
Why would she do that to me?

26:42.059 --> 26:44.311
Probably because you always say yes.

26:44.395 --> 26:45.813
No, I don't. Do I?

26:45.897 --> 26:48.733
- Bertie, you're a total pushover.
- I'm not a pushover!

26:48.816 --> 26:51.027
I mean it in a good way.
That's why we like you.

26:51.110 --> 26:53.445
You... you do what people ask you to.
You're great.

26:54.446 --> 26:56.783
Well, she's a bitch! That's right.

26:56.866 --> 26:58.868
I'm sorry to say it,
but that's what Cynthia is,

26:58.951 --> 27:00.202
and I think we can all agree.

27:00.286 --> 27:03.873
I don't need a focus group to tell me
that Cynthia's a royal fucking bitch!

27:03.956 --> 27:05.207
Do you like Cynthia?

27:05.291 --> 27:07.293
Uh, I mean, she's... No... no...

27:07.376 --> 27:10.129
No, I don't think you do, because
she's a total fucking bitch, right?

27:10.212 --> 27:11.297
And guess what?

27:11.380 --> 27:12.882
She's never even read <i>Harry Potter.</i>

27:12.965 --> 27:14.591
I've read it. I've read them all twice.

27:14.676 --> 27:17.053
That's seven books twice.
That's 14 books.

27:17.136 --> 27:19.972
She's never even read it.
She's not even enjoying the park.

27:21.182 --> 27:23.810
[sighs] Good luck with the juicers.

27:23.893 --> 27:24.894
Okay.

27:29.315 --> 27:31.650
You Mickey? I'm your Uber driver.

27:39.826 --> 27:41.035
[sighs]

27:41.118 --> 27:43.579
Actually, uh,
I think I'll stick around here.

27:44.163 --> 27:45.206
How you gonna get home?

27:46.123 --> 27:47.683
I don't know.
I'll figure something out.

27:48.584 --> 27:50.962
But, uh, will you take my filing cabinet?

28:04.308 --> 28:06.728
[cell phone vibrating]

28:06.811 --> 28:08.104
Hey.

28:08.187 --> 28:11.148
[Randy] <i>Hey.
So, uh, I've been thinkin' about it,</i>

28:11.232 --> 28:14.401
and, uh, I feel bad
taking this check from you.

28:14.485 --> 28:16.528
Oh. Uh...

28:18.656 --> 28:19.740
Don't feel bad.

28:20.867 --> 28:23.911
- You sure?
- Yeah, positive.

28:24.829 --> 28:26.080
Keep the check.

28:26.789 --> 28:28.249
As long as you're cool with it.

28:29.166 --> 28:31.585
So, uh, should I come over?

28:32.419 --> 28:33.921
Oh, um...

28:35.506 --> 28:37.884
maybe not, actually.

28:37.967 --> 28:42.722
I just had such a long day,
and I'm so tired. So...

28:42.805 --> 28:45.516
Yeah, no, no, that, uh...
that makes sense.

28:45.599 --> 28:47.852
<i>Uh, I guess I'll talk to you tomorrow?</i>

28:48.770 --> 28:50.437
Yeah. Definitely.

28:51.355 --> 28:53.649
Talk then. Bye.

28:56.568 --> 28:57.569
Bye.

29:37.526 --> 29:40.947
Elise, you've taught me
everything that I know.

29:42.114 --> 29:45.409
How to be a woman,
how to be a witch...

29:46.535 --> 29:48.287
even how to flirt with boys.

29:49.705 --> 29:51.123
<i>Bobby never did ask me out,</i>

29:51.207 --> 29:54.626
<i>but... if he does,
you'll be the first one to know.</i>

29:56.879 --> 29:58.214
<i>Goodbye, my cousin.</i>

29:59.173 --> 30:00.382
<i>Goodbye, Elise.</i>

30:02.426 --> 30:04.011
<i>Goodbye, sweet witch.</i>

30:06.513 --> 30:09.225

30:13.687 --> 30:15.689

<i>I must leave home
and venture into the night</i>

30:24.656 --> 30:27.784

and my seven senses to protect me.</i>

30:29.078 --> 30:30.204

<i>Farewell.</i>
