WEBVTT

00:05.239 --> 00:07.469
Jump!
Are you nuts?

00:07.541 --> 00:09.236
What are we waiting for?

00:09.577 --> 00:12.273
Thomas, we fell three stories
into a garbage truck.

00:12.346 --> 00:14.211
And that garbage truck
saved our lives.

00:14.281 --> 00:17.079
She's the first person we call
whenever you get us in trouble.

00:17.151 --> 00:19.949
Today is gonna be
the biggest day of my career.

00:22.089 --> 00:23.681
These are the guys
who say they know you.

00:23.758 --> 00:25.123
It's about time you got here.

00:25.192 --> 00:26.819
Pull over! Police!

00:26.994 --> 00:28.291
In a Ferrari?

01:44.472 --> 01:48.101
<i>The last time I
threw in a real game was 1967.</i>

01:48.175 --> 01:49.938
<i>It was the Army-Navy game...</i>

01:50.010 --> 01:53.002
<i>and I went 21 for 30 with
two touchdowns in the air...</i>

01:53.080 --> 01:55.207
<i>and a scramble for another.</i>

01:58.586 --> 02:01.817
<i>The secretary of the Navy presented
me with the game ball.</i>

02:05.960 --> 02:08.520
Nice throw, Thomas.
Still got the old touch.

02:08.596 --> 02:10.120
Okay!
Yeah!

02:10.364 --> 02:11.558
Up and in.
Yeah.

02:11.632 --> 02:12.894
On three.
Yeah.

02:12.967 --> 02:14.867
Ready? Let's go! Hey.

02:15.035 --> 02:16.593
Hut, hut.

02:18.539 --> 02:21.007
<i>1967 was a long time ago.</i>

02:21.342 --> 02:24.539
<i>It's been that long since I'd
been to the Army-Navy game.</i>

02:24.612 --> 02:28.048
<i>I would always mean to go, but
something would always come up.</i>

02:28.249 --> 02:30.547
<i>This year it was
going to be different.</i>

02:30.618 --> 02:32.677
<i>I was going to see
the old team again.</i>

02:32.753 --> 02:35.517
<i>And we were going to relive those
thrilling days of yesteryear...</i>

02:35.589 --> 02:37.750
<i>by having a
touch football rematch...</i>

02:37.825 --> 02:40.089
<i>with the Army team of 1967.</i>

02:40.694 --> 02:43.492
<i>It wouldn't be long
before the guys got to see...</i>

02:43.631 --> 02:46.156
<i>the old Magnum magic again.</i>

02:46.300 --> 02:47.528
Yes, Rick. What is it?

02:49.470 --> 02:50.903
T.C., lookout!

02:57.578 --> 02:58.602
Higgins?

02:59.313 --> 03:00.974
Higgie, baby, you all right?
Is he all right?

03:01.048 --> 03:02.037
I don't know.

03:02.116 --> 03:04.380
Higgins? How do you feel?

03:05.686 --> 03:10.123
Like the time I was trampled by a
herd of wild South American capybaras.

03:10.257 --> 03:13.590
Take it easy. It was in Peru,
I believe, or perhaps Bolivia.

03:13.761 --> 03:15.194
Anyway, I
saw them coming at me...

03:15.262 --> 03:16.854
and when I attempted
to flee, I...

03:16.931 --> 03:18.228
He's all right.

03:18.933 --> 03:22.425
I'm sorry, Higgins, I didn't
see you. Quite all right, T.C.

03:22.570 --> 03:25.505
Hey, you want to stay
and run a few patterns?

03:32.313 --> 03:34.110
Higgie, baby,
you really take a hit.

03:34.181 --> 03:35.614
Last guy I steamrolled
didn't get up.

03:35.683 --> 03:38.618
Hello? Thomas, you better
get to the club right away.

03:38.686 --> 03:40.153
I can't.
I have a plane to catch...

03:40.221 --> 03:42.052
in a few hours, and I
haven't packed anything yet.

03:42.122 --> 03:45.057
It's important. One of your-
So is the Army-Navy game...

03:45.125 --> 03:48.219
and nothing, nothing is going
to interfere with my game.

03:48.429 --> 03:51.557
What interference? Today is
Tuesday. The game isn't until Friday.

03:51.632 --> 03:53.896
Tomorrow is the reunion
with my old teammates...

03:53.968 --> 03:56.766
an oyster roast and all the
Old Düsseldorf we can drink.

03:56.837 --> 03:59.203
Old Düsseldorf? <i>Yeah,</i>
<i>it's an old German beer.</i>

03:59.273 --> 04:01.605
It's brewed in Maryland.
Anyway, and Thursday...

04:01.675 --> 04:05.771
is the long-awaited rematch between
the 1967 Army and Navy teams.

04:05.946 --> 04:08.244
This problem
won't take very long, Thomas.

04:08.315 --> 04:10.476
No! No, this is
how it always starts.

04:10.551 --> 04:12.815
This is how I miss
the game every year.

04:12.886 --> 04:14.046
It's urgent!

04:14.288 --> 04:15.414
It's Carol.

04:16.790 --> 04:18.382
For Pete's sake.

04:20.060 --> 04:21.527
Hi, Thomas.

04:23.364 --> 04:25.332
Come on and sit down...

04:27.301 --> 04:29.030
Look what I did.
Uh-oh, <i>le</i> boo-boo.

04:31.205 --> 04:33.867
Oh, gotta get me another one of
those guys. How many has she had?

04:33.941 --> 04:35.374
Count the umbrellas,
you're talking doubles.

04:35.442 --> 04:38.377
Why do you keep serving her?
Hey, Thomas, I tried to stop her.

04:38.445 --> 04:40.879
She stood up and started yelling
a bunch of legal stuff at me.

04:40.948 --> 04:43.280
Look, you gotta get her out of
the club, it doesn't look good.

04:43.350 --> 04:46.080
It doesn't look good
for the deputy PA either.

04:46.654 --> 04:51.387
Waiter! Waiter, I would like
another mai tai, <i>por favor...</i>

04:51.492 --> 04:53.084
Carol, hi.

04:53.160 --> 04:54.752
Hi. I
think you've had enough.

04:55.929 --> 04:59.296
Hey, I thought
you was going off...

04:59.366 --> 05:03.097
to join your old shipmidsmen
today. It's midshipmen.

05:03.470 --> 05:06.030
The plane leaves at 2:00,
and what are you doing here?

05:06.106 --> 05:08.301
He never brought me my drink.

05:10.177 --> 05:11.405
Waiter.

05:11.712 --> 05:14.977
Carol. Carol...
Orville? Somebody!

05:16.650 --> 05:18.948
I am going to take you home.

05:20.454 --> 05:23.719
I'm very happy here,
thank you so very much.

05:23.791 --> 05:26.487
I don't think this is the
place to be.

05:31.198 --> 05:33.132
I was fired, Thomas.

05:34.068 --> 05:37.435
What? That's terrible, how?

05:39.807 --> 05:42.002
They said it was budget cuts.

05:43.010 --> 05:47.470
I know. I know better, see. I
know too damn much, if you ask me.

05:47.915 --> 05:51.908
Thomas, they don't like
me knowing too much.

05:53.320 --> 05:56.619
Have you ever heard of a
bigtime hood named Clinton?

05:56.757 --> 05:59.783
Well, as a matter of fact-
Well, I have, seen plenty.

05:59.860 --> 06:02.090
Ever heard of the Clinton case?

06:03.297 --> 06:06.494
Mine. Except when I start
finding out too much...

06:07.768 --> 06:09.429
they took it away from me.

06:09.503 --> 06:11.903
Well, listen,
if you suspect that someone-

06:11.972 --> 06:14.236
He never brought me my drink.

06:14.308 --> 06:16.299
Well, maybe he ought to
bring you some coffee.

06:16.377 --> 06:19.540
Guts! See, I got
great big guts!

06:19.646 --> 06:21.238
And they're not gonna stop me.

06:21.315 --> 06:23.875
I will continue my
investigation... Carol.

06:23.951 --> 06:25.851
And I'll get to the truth... Carol.

06:25.919 --> 06:28.410
And justice will be served!
Carol, come on.

06:31.125 --> 06:32.615
Oh, Thomas.
What?

06:33.627 --> 06:35.891
I think I'm going to be sick.

06:41.101 --> 06:42.568
How you feeling?

06:45.239 --> 06:48.640
Right now, death seems
like a pleasant alternative.

06:51.478 --> 06:53.446
Can I get you anything
before I go?

06:53.881 --> 06:55.815
Oh, no, you've done enough.

06:57.050 --> 06:59.177
Anyway,
you have a plane to catch.

06:59.286 --> 07:03.620
Yeah. I better get going.
I haven't even packed yet.

07:05.592 --> 07:06.820
See you.

07:07.094 --> 07:09.756
I mean, it isn't even your
problem. I don't expect you...

07:09.830 --> 07:13.425
to take any time away from your
Navy reunion to help me out.

07:13.500 --> 07:14.990
Carol, I'll be glad
to help you out.

07:17.504 --> 07:21.270
You will? Of course. Just
as soon as I get back.

07:22.176 --> 07:24.303
Oh, that's really sweet, Thomas.

07:25.412 --> 07:28.108
Of course, by then it'll
probably be too late.

07:28.282 --> 07:31.615
But you go to your game now. I'd
feel terrible if you missed it.

07:31.685 --> 07:33.084
I... Really.

07:33.787 --> 07:38.019
I mean, besides, a real crime is
probably out of your league, anyway.

07:38.625 --> 07:40.957
I'll just take care
of it myself.

07:42.229 --> 07:45.221
What's that supposed to mean?
Well, nothing.

07:45.566 --> 07:50.128
It's just that you're great at divorce cases,
and I gotta deal with real criminals.

07:50.204 --> 07:51.694
Real criminals?

07:51.772 --> 07:54.866
Carol, I deal with
real criminals all the time.

07:55.676 --> 07:58.873
Taking saunas with Ice Pick
doesn't count, Thomas.

07:59.613 --> 08:02.582
Clinton makes Ice Pick
look like Mister Rogers.

08:03.851 --> 08:06.479
A real hood like that
would probably scare you silly.

08:07.821 --> 08:11.018
Well, listen,
if this guy is so dangerous...

08:11.091 --> 08:13.321
I don't think you should get
involved. You could get hurt.

08:13.393 --> 08:17.523
Give me a little credit, will you?
I'm a professional just like you.

08:17.698 --> 08:20.223
I can handle this
very discreetly.

08:20.868 --> 08:23.063
Like getting drunk and
yelling about it in public?

08:24.605 --> 08:28.803
Yes, I will admit that was not very
discreet. But from here on out...

08:29.176 --> 08:30.507
I'm fine.

08:32.145 --> 08:33.304
Go on.

08:35.582 --> 08:38.176
All I need is a pair
of dark glasses and a big hat.

08:38.251 --> 08:40.515
Carol, look, you could even
get killed in this.

08:40.587 --> 08:43.020
Couldn't you just wait till I
get back? But I don't have time-

08:43.090 --> 08:44.250
Now, it's just four days!

08:45.692 --> 08:47.091
Maybe you're right.

08:47.160 --> 08:50.561
Of course I am. Just take the time off.
You could use a vacation, you know?

08:50.631 --> 08:52.997
And then, when I get back, I'll
help you with Clinton, okay?

08:53.700 --> 08:54.758
Okay.

08:55.068 --> 08:56.092
You promise?

08:56.169 --> 08:59.195
I promise.
Now go on, get out of here.

09:04.511 --> 09:05.705
Thomas?

09:07.948 --> 09:10.974
Have a good time,
and "Go, Navy."

09:16.723 --> 09:19.624
<i>I guess in
the bigger scheme of things...</i>

09:19.860 --> 09:21.725
<i>a football game
shouldn't mean that much.</i>

09:21.795 --> 09:25.697
<i>But the 1967
Army-Navy game was different.</i>

09:26.333 --> 09:30.064
<i>At least for me anyway.
A few months after the game...</i>

09:30.771 --> 09:34.298
<i>I graduated, and a short time
after that, I went to Nam.</i>

09:34.975 --> 09:37.671
<i>That experience changed
everyone who was in it.</i>

09:38.078 --> 09:41.980
<i>I lost my youth. I don't know
the exact day I lost it...</i>

09:42.583 --> 09:46.519
<i>but when I try to recall, the
last thing I can remember...</i>

09:46.653 --> 09:50.783
<i>is a windy day in November,
when I went 21 for 30...</i>

09:51.325 --> 09:53.885
<i>and the team mascot
ate my game ball.</i>

09:55.596 --> 09:58.565
<i>I guess that's what you get
for having a goat as a mascot.</i>

09:58.632 --> 10:00.896
Thomas. I don't believe you.

10:01.635 --> 10:03.865
You guys ever hear of knocking?

10:04.271 --> 10:08.207
Man, the way you deserted Carol
was low. Who said I deserted Carol?

10:08.275 --> 10:11.642
She did. I called to see how she was doing
and she said you refused to help her.

10:11.712 --> 10:14.340
That's not true!
She told me to leave.

10:14.414 --> 10:17.975
That's because she's not the type
to beg. Hey, listen, Thomas...

10:18.051 --> 10:20.713
this guy Clinton is bad news.
Now, the word on the street...

10:20.787 --> 10:24.553
is that he knocked off the top drug distributor
on the island and took over the operation.

10:24.625 --> 10:26.456
Well, then she'd better
stay away from him.

10:26.526 --> 10:29.256
Well, she won't
unless you help her.

10:29.329 --> 10:32.423
Well, we all help her.
Hell, we all owe her.

10:32.599 --> 10:35.432
She's the first person we call
whenever you get us in trouble.

10:35.502 --> 10:38.232
I'm afraid I must concur
with Rick and T.C.

10:38.605 --> 10:41.938
Why, she was of the greatest assistance
that time I was wrongly incarcerated.

10:42.009 --> 10:43.374
How did you get into this?

10:43.443 --> 10:46.207
Carol called for
my famous hangover remedy.

10:46.279 --> 10:49.339
She happened to mention how you
deserted her in her time of need.

10:49.416 --> 10:52.749
I did not desert her! She
practically threw me out of the house.

10:52.819 --> 10:55.287
She knows how important this
game is to me. Besides...

10:55.355 --> 10:58.347
Listen, the game isn't for
another three days.

10:59.226 --> 11:01.854
Guys. Look, at least skip the reunion.

11:01.928 --> 11:05.796
I mean, you don't even like oysters, and
you can drink Old Duesenberg anytime.

11:05.866 --> 11:09.393
It's Old Düsseldorf, and it's
very hard to get on this island!

11:09.469 --> 11:13.064
Look, I'm trying to tell you, Carol
said she'd wait for me to get back.

11:13.273 --> 11:16.504
Uh-uh, that is not
what she told us.

11:19.980 --> 11:23.347
Okay, I'll talk to her again.

11:23.917 --> 11:26.351
She'll be happy to wait.
Excuse me.

11:46.106 --> 11:47.266
Carol?

11:55.182 --> 11:56.342
Carol?

12:39.142 --> 12:40.632
Welcome back.

12:46.149 --> 12:47.639
What happened?

12:47.884 --> 12:51.445
You got another nice lump on your
head to add to the collection.

12:55.525 --> 12:57.356
It's 4:00.
You know, it's funny...

12:57.427 --> 12:59.224
how that happens
about this time every day.

12:59.295 --> 13:02.787
I missed my plane.
Oh, don't worry, Thomas.

13:03.966 --> 13:06.992
I made you another
reservation for tomorrow.

13:10.640 --> 13:12.403
Well, what the hell.

13:12.909 --> 13:16.675
It's just a reunion.
No, it was important to you.

13:17.113 --> 13:21.243
It's a shame you missed it. I'm
really sorry. That feels good.

13:23.353 --> 13:25.287
What were you
doing here, anyway?

13:26.322 --> 13:29.587
Well, after your little
telephone conversation to Rick-

13:29.659 --> 13:32.924
I told him not to say anything to you.
- And T.C. and Higgins.

13:33.229 --> 13:34.218
Oh.

13:35.098 --> 13:37.566
I wish they hadn't mentioned
it to you, Thomas. Really.

13:37.633 --> 13:40.830
I just thought that maybe I could
wrap it all up before you came back.

13:40.903 --> 13:44.168
You promised that you'd wait.

13:44.240 --> 13:47.266
And I was going to.
Really, I was.

13:47.710 --> 13:50.304
But I just had this feeling that
Clinton's men were on to me...

13:50.380 --> 13:53.213
and I'd better
strike while the iron was hot.

13:54.417 --> 13:57.443
You see? This is proof.
What's proof?

13:57.520 --> 14:00.011
I'm sure it was one of
Clinton's men who conked you.

14:00.089 --> 14:02.649
So? That means they
know that I'm on to them.

14:02.725 --> 14:05.455
They must have been searching for
some information they think I have.

14:05.528 --> 14:08.429
Which you don't.
Not yet, but I will.

14:08.831 --> 14:11.698
I've spent a lot of time
researching Clinton.

14:11.768 --> 14:14.328
And I know what paper
he buys in the morning...

14:14.404 --> 14:17.805
and what restaurants he goes
to at night. That's terrific.

14:17.874 --> 14:21.366
And I know the layout of his
office like the back of my hand.

14:21.444 --> 14:25.437
If Clinton has anything incriminating
lying around, it'll be in his office.

14:25.515 --> 14:28.575
Thomas, I need to get in there.

14:35.425 --> 14:39.225
When is my flight tomorrow?
3:30.

14:42.398 --> 14:45.561
Well, I suppose we could check a
few things out tomorrow morning.

14:45.635 --> 14:47.728
Oh, Thomas!

14:49.372 --> 14:50.999
You're wonderful.

14:52.141 --> 14:54.837
But you know what? We don't have
to wait, we could start right now.

14:54.911 --> 14:58.312
No, no, no. Right now, we gotta
find a place for you to stay.

14:58.381 --> 15:02.249
It's not safe here. Don't you have a
relative or some friends you can stay with?

15:02.318 --> 15:05.685
And let them get conked on the
head? Now, don't worry about me.

15:05.755 --> 15:09.350
I'll just get a cheap motel room.
No! I mean, that's the worst place.

15:09.425 --> 15:12.053
Clinton would get to you
and no one would know it.

15:12.695 --> 15:16.529
What I really need is a place
with full security, you know.

15:16.933 --> 15:21.893
Alarm systems, fences, guard
dogs. Prison would be nice.

15:23.306 --> 15:24.796
Or the estate.

15:27.176 --> 15:29.576
Now, that's perfect!
No.

15:29.645 --> 15:30.737
Let me change.
No.

15:30.813 --> 15:32.713
No, no, wait a minute!
I'll pack a small bag.

15:32.782 --> 15:36.013
The estate is not perfect.
Higgins would never allow it.

15:49.398 --> 15:50.695
Higgins?

15:51.467 --> 15:53.435
Magnum, I thought
you were off to your game.

15:53.503 --> 15:56.495
Well, I was, but I
stopped by Carol's and...

15:56.806 --> 15:59.934
Higgins, we have something important
that we'd like to talk to you about.

16:00.009 --> 16:02.477
Important? I'll tell you
what's important.

16:02.545 --> 16:06.208
I'm trying to write out the recipe
for escabeche of young partridge...

16:06.282 --> 16:09.046
and I know there is some vital
ingredient I'm forgetting.

16:09.118 --> 16:12.019
Higgins, you know the trouble
that Carol's been having?

16:12.088 --> 16:14.249
Well, this afternoon
I was hit over the head.

16:14.323 --> 16:16.883
Coriander seeds.
That's what you're forgetting.

16:18.027 --> 16:19.824
My God, you're right.

16:21.063 --> 16:24.521
Now that the great escabeche of young
partridge mystery has been solved...

16:24.600 --> 16:27.728
My second cousin Reginald used to shoot
the wretched little things at me...

16:27.803 --> 16:32.035
through a straw. I must have subliminally
eliminated them from the recipe.

16:32.108 --> 16:35.600
Higgins, I was hit
over the head at Carol's apartment!

16:35.678 --> 16:39.011
Really. Carol, I didn't know
you were a gourmet.

16:39.081 --> 16:41.345
Yes. I took a year off...

16:41.417 --> 16:42.907
between college
and law school to attend...

16:42.985 --> 16:45.681
Chef Roget's
<i>Académie de Cuisine</i> in Paris.

16:45.755 --> 16:48.189
Fascinating.
Yeah, that's just great.

16:48.257 --> 16:50.350
Higgins, Carol's apartment
is not safe anymore.

16:50.426 --> 16:53.259
You know, I've been put in charge
of a political fundraising dinner...

16:53.329 --> 16:56.389
for next weekend and I've been going
mad trying to put together a menu.

16:56.465 --> 16:59.457
Do you suppose you could...
Oh, I'd love to.

16:59.535 --> 17:01.264
Why isn't anybody
listening to me?

17:01.337 --> 17:02.804
I plan to test every menu...

17:02.905 --> 17:04.202
before I turn them over
to the club's chef.

17:04.339 --> 17:06.830
It will take several days
to put together a proper menu.

17:07.676 --> 17:09.577
Well, I'm out of work.
My time is yours.

17:09.645 --> 17:10.669
Wonderful.

17:10.746 --> 17:14.238
And would you consider being my guest here
at the estate for the next couple of days?

17:14.317 --> 17:15.978
I'd love to.
Good.

17:16.551 --> 17:18.247
Now, Magnum, what have
you been going on about?

17:19.655 --> 17:23.682
Jonathan. Do you think we should
start by making this recipe tonight?

17:23.759 --> 17:27.160
Splendid. I'll go to the
market and get what we need.

17:32.168 --> 17:33.465
Well...

17:34.470 --> 17:38.270
there's no use in us waiting around here.
We can go out while Higgins is gone...

17:38.341 --> 17:41.003
and be back in time for
dinner. Go out where?

17:41.077 --> 17:43.944
To Clinton's office.
He keeps records in his safe.

17:44.013 --> 17:45.878
You know, business associates,
appointments...

17:45.948 --> 17:48.382
Carol. Maybe even the
name of the inside man...

17:48.451 --> 17:52.114
in the Prosecutor's Office.
Carol, you are not suggesting...

17:52.188 --> 17:55.351
that we break into Clinton's
office safe, are you?

17:56.659 --> 17:58.923
Carol, that's crazy.

18:00.630 --> 18:03.599
Well, maybe you're right.
Not to mention illegal...

18:03.666 --> 18:05.793
and extremely hazardous
to our health.

18:05.868 --> 18:08.063
Now, Carol, if Clinton
is as big as you say he is...

18:08.137 --> 18:11.368
he's gonna have all kinds of
security. It'd take the Navy SEALs...

18:11.440 --> 18:12.702
to breach his operation.

18:12.775 --> 18:15.403
No, no, no, Thomas.
I've checked it out.

18:15.645 --> 18:18.773
We won't need any muscle at
all if we just use our heads.

18:28.491 --> 18:31.426
No! No, no, no.

18:31.494 --> 18:34.224
The exception was made
in Grant versus Grant.

18:34.296 --> 18:36.230
She didn't get the house,
she didn't even get alimony.

18:36.298 --> 18:39.392
But that's only due to the discovery
on the honeymoon that she was really...

18:39.468 --> 18:42.335
a male transvestite. It doesn't
matter, it still set a precedent.

18:42.405 --> 18:44.032
Hold it, hold it, hold it! I
need to see your building ID.

18:44.106 --> 18:45.130
Oh, it's okay, Officer...

18:45.207 --> 18:46.640
I have an office
on the fifth floor.

18:46.709 --> 18:48.336
No, I'm sorry,
I still need to see it.

18:48.411 --> 18:50.345
Wait a minute. Herb?

18:51.047 --> 18:54.073
Herbie. Herbie. Let
me ask you a question.

18:54.150 --> 18:57.278
Have you ever been married? Yes,
sir. But I'm divorced now, though.

18:58.454 --> 19:01.389
An expert witness. Counselor,
you're wasting your time...

19:01.457 --> 19:03.823
it's all in my briefs. Well,
if you don't mind, Counselor...

19:03.893 --> 19:06.487
I am talking to Herbie.
Let me ask you something else.

19:06.562 --> 19:09.463
Did your wife get everything? Just
about. She got the furniture...

19:09.532 --> 19:12.057
the kids, and the LTD.
That's not fair.

19:12.168 --> 19:14.568
Damn rights, it's not! That's
why I gotta work this extra job...

19:14.637 --> 19:17.663
just to pay for the alimony. That's
because your lawyer knuckled under.

19:17.740 --> 19:20.004
He did not fight
this terrible injustice.

19:20.076 --> 19:21.441
Yeah, well, I
guess I shouldn't have used...

19:21.510 --> 19:23.102
my brother-in-law
as my attorney.

19:23.179 --> 19:24.407
But I couldn't afford
anybody better.

19:24.480 --> 19:25.538
Well, let me
tell you something...

19:25.614 --> 19:27.809
I am not going to knuckle
under. My client-

19:27.883 --> 19:31.444
Deserves nothing. It's all
in my briefs in my office.

19:31.520 --> 19:34.080
Yeah? Well, you just wait till
I get my hands on your briefs.

19:34.156 --> 19:36.681
I'm gonna tear them to shreds.
I'm gonna fight this thing...

19:36.759 --> 19:38.056
for society.
Yeah.

19:38.127 --> 19:39.389
And men.
Yeah.

19:39.562 --> 19:41.894
For you.
Yeah, you show them.

19:50.206 --> 19:53.767
You sure there's no guards
at the doors? Yeah, positive.

19:53.943 --> 19:56.434
There's just infrared beams
in the office...

19:56.512 --> 19:59.208
which are connected to an
alarm system in Clinton's home.

20:00.416 --> 20:04.250
If it's tripped he can be here in
five minutes, and we're in big trouble.

20:09.191 --> 20:10.681
It's this way.

20:15.331 --> 20:17.196
First one on the left.

20:24.273 --> 20:26.264
No alarms on the door?
No.

20:27.042 --> 20:30.944
You sure you can do this?
Yeah, but I still don't like it.

20:31.013 --> 20:33.413
Why?
Everything is going great.

20:33.616 --> 20:36.312
We snowed Herbie, we're practically
inside the office already.

20:36.385 --> 20:39.513
Don't get overconfident.
That's when things go wrong.

20:39.588 --> 20:41.886
Nothing is going wrong.

20:44.493 --> 20:45.721
<i>Voilà!</i>

20:48.864 --> 20:51.992
The beams, remember?
Of course.

20:52.668 --> 20:53.657
The beams.

21:33.776 --> 21:36.404
Thomas, the safe
is behind there.

21:36.779 --> 21:38.804
Great. Take a look.
Okay.

21:44.220 --> 21:48.384
Now, follow
me and do exactly as I do.

21:48.791 --> 21:49.883
Okay.

22:07.042 --> 22:08.566
Now, be careful.

22:45.314 --> 22:48.306
You didn't happen to come up with
the combination for the safe, did you?

22:48.384 --> 22:50.511
No. That's why
I needed you.

22:54.857 --> 22:59.556
This is great. Everything just
seems to be falling into place.

22:59.962 --> 23:02.624
I haven't been this excited
since I... Since I...

23:03.866 --> 23:06.061
Nope, I've never
been this excited.

23:09.972 --> 23:12.236
Where did you learn
to crack safes, Thomas?

23:12.308 --> 23:14.299
I was in Naval Intelligence.

23:14.810 --> 23:16.675
They trained you
to be a safecracker?

23:17.313 --> 23:18.644
Locksmith.

23:20.215 --> 23:24.447
All these years sitting behind desks.
I was really missing out on the action.

23:24.520 --> 23:29.082
This is fun, isn't it, Thomas? Will
you stop it? I can't concentrate.

23:36.598 --> 23:37.997
Here we go.

23:42.938 --> 23:44.200
<i>C'est ça.</i>

23:48.410 --> 23:51.038
Let me see.
Let me see. No, we don't have time...

23:51.113 --> 23:53.138
to look them over.
Just do what I told you.

23:54.817 --> 23:56.045
Oh, boy.

23:56.919 --> 23:58.546
Here I go.
Okay.

23:58.620 --> 24:00.281
Wait a minute.
This is the thing.

24:00.356 --> 24:01.345
Hey.

24:04.493 --> 24:06.222
Don't go so fast.
Wait a minute, Thomas.

24:06.295 --> 24:08.160
This looks
important. Wait, I can't see-

24:08.230 --> 24:09.629
Uh-oh.

24:13.902 --> 24:16.029
Just keep going. Come
on, hurry up. Okay.

24:32.521 --> 24:34.546
Carol! If they're after us,
they'll be in the elevator.

24:34.623 --> 24:36.989
We have to take the stairs.
You have no way of knowing that.

24:37.059 --> 24:38.185
Trust me.

24:38.260 --> 24:39.284
Oh.

24:46.735 --> 24:47.963
Thomas.

24:50.539 --> 24:52.530
With your instincts no wonder
you get shot at-

24:52.608 --> 24:53.836
Come on.

25:13.195 --> 25:15.356
Jump!
Are you nuts?

25:15.631 --> 25:17.496
The garbage will break
your fall. Jump!

25:17.566 --> 25:19.898
And my neck. I'm not gonna
jump and that's final.

25:21.370 --> 25:22.359
What are we waiting for?

25:38.252 --> 25:41.813
Three stories, Thomas, we fell
three stories into a garbage truck.

25:41.889 --> 25:46.292
We did not fall three stories, we jumped.
And that garbage truck saved our lives.

25:46.360 --> 25:48.954
And it ruined my suit. The
creamed spinach left stains...

25:49.029 --> 25:51.623
I'll never get out.
Are you two still squabbling?

25:51.699 --> 25:52.757
Yes.
Yes.

25:52.833 --> 25:54.767
Well, take a breather.

25:55.502 --> 25:57.663
The escabeche is ready.

25:58.772 --> 26:02.538
And even though I had to
substitute chicken for partridge...

26:03.043 --> 26:05.739
I do think you'll be
astounded by the results.

26:06.680 --> 26:09.979
When you have to explain to the
butcher what a partridge is...

26:10.351 --> 26:12.512
there's little hope
of obtaining one.

26:16.423 --> 26:17.583
There you are, Carol.

26:17.658 --> 26:19.592
Perfectly seasoned,
of course. Enjoy.

26:19.660 --> 26:23.027
These pictures are actually pretty
good. Pretty good? They're great.

26:23.097 --> 26:25.622
Note the delicate
hint of lime juice.

26:27.034 --> 26:29.594
Look at all
these canceled checks.

26:30.270 --> 26:34.104
Have you ever heard of a company
called El Gato, Incorporated before?

26:34.174 --> 26:35.903
They sure have gotten
a lot of checks.

26:36.176 --> 26:38.167
Sounds like something
out of a pulp novel.

26:38.245 --> 26:40.270
The sweet fragrance
of the red onion.

26:42.049 --> 26:44.074
The bite of the jalapeños.

26:44.151 --> 26:45.812
Now, this looks like something.

26:46.654 --> 26:49.316
A notation about a meeting
that's going to take place.

26:50.624 --> 26:51.886
This is it. It's gotta be.

26:55.029 --> 26:56.428
Who's Vincent Osborne?

26:56.497 --> 26:58.727
I don't know, but he's
meeting Clinton tomorrow.

26:58.799 --> 27:00.130
El Gato's supplying protection.

27:02.302 --> 27:04.600
Yeah, Osborne's our man.
No, wait a minute...

27:04.672 --> 27:09.166
you're jumping to conclusions. Osborne
could be his barber, for all we know.

27:10.010 --> 27:12.342
We have to figure out a way to
get into that meeting, Thomas.

27:12.413 --> 27:14.040
No, we don't have to
figure anything out.

27:14.114 --> 27:15.706
We've done enough
figuring for one night.

27:15.783 --> 27:18.183
Thomas, please! Let's just
finish our chicken escarb-

27:18.252 --> 27:19.981
Escabeche.
Whatever.

27:20.087 --> 27:23.386
Get some sleep, look at all this in the
morning with a fresh eye, all right?

27:24.792 --> 27:26.783
Higgins, this stuff is great.

27:32.800 --> 27:35.132
I seem to have lost my appetite.

27:41.642 --> 27:43.974
That's the
lamest plan I ever heard.

27:44.044 --> 27:46.945
It is not a lame plan.
We got it all worked out.

27:48.382 --> 27:50.509
Look, we got the time,
the place, everything.

27:51.552 --> 27:52.985
It's lame.

27:53.153 --> 27:55.815
Magnum, why are you being
so negative and hostile?

27:55.889 --> 27:58.756
Because, if Osborne is the biggest
drug dealer in the Midwest...

27:58.826 --> 28:01.624
then he's as dangerous as
Clinton. Let the police handle it.

28:01.695 --> 28:04.528
It'll never happen, Thomas.
Clinton owns someone...

28:04.598 --> 28:07.965
in the Prosecutor's Office.
Maybe the prosecutor.

28:08.335 --> 28:10.303
I thought you wanted me
to go to my game?

28:10.370 --> 28:12.736
Hey, Thomas, Ice Pick
has got everything set up.

28:12.806 --> 28:16.606
Now we know the exact location of the
place and I got us access into the room.

28:16.677 --> 28:20.511
Yeah, and Clinton and Osborne
have never met. It's foolproof!

28:21.115 --> 28:22.412
It's lame.

28:22.516 --> 28:24.643
Magnum, why do you
keep saying that word?

28:24.718 --> 28:26.913
Because the plan
will never work, Higgins.

28:27.488 --> 28:29.820
Come on, let's go.
Who needs him anyway?

28:29.890 --> 28:31.084
We do.

28:31.158 --> 28:33.319
He's the only one of us
who has any real experience...

28:33.393 --> 28:36.123
with this kind of thing.
That's not entirely true.

28:36.897 --> 28:38.762
No, of course, Jonathan.

28:38.832 --> 28:41.824
But if one of us were to make
a mistake and someone got hurt...

28:42.603 --> 28:44.070
I'd never forgive myself.

28:46.240 --> 28:48.708
We'd better just forget
about the whole thing.

28:48.776 --> 28:50.971
I guess with my incredible
success last night...

28:51.044 --> 28:53.535
I just got carried away.

28:55.015 --> 28:56.812
You're right, Thomas.

28:56.884 --> 28:59.819
I don't really have a feel
for this Pl business yet.

29:00.554 --> 29:02.454
Carol. No. It's all right.

29:03.323 --> 29:04.847
I'm a trained chef.

29:04.925 --> 29:07.723
Must be a restaurant around
somewhere that could use me.

29:11.965 --> 29:13.398
This is crazy.

29:13.467 --> 29:15.128
You better step on it, Thomas.

29:15.202 --> 29:19.730
Ice Pick said the limo was gonna
pick up Osborne at Access D at 1:00.

29:20.073 --> 29:22.405
This guy's a gangster.
We can't do this.

29:22.476 --> 29:25.673
I mean, think about it.
What if we can't stop Osborne?

29:25.746 --> 29:27.407
We'll stop him.
Well, what if...

29:27.481 --> 29:29.847
Clinton realizes that
Higgins isn't Osborne?

29:29.917 --> 29:32.750
Just relax,
Higgins knows what he's doing.

29:33.387 --> 29:36.879
Okay, everything's ready to
go. This is exciting, isn't it?

29:36.957 --> 29:39.482
Quite. You'd better
get to your post.

29:40.360 --> 29:44.228
I'm curious, Rick. Why is
Ice Pick being so helpful?

29:44.531 --> 29:46.522
Osborne ran
Ice Pick out of Chicago.

29:47.734 --> 29:49.258
Put him out of commission.

29:49.336 --> 29:51.804
He just doesn't like the way
Clinton does business.

29:52.306 --> 29:55.173
Well, I guess
now we just wait...

29:55.242 --> 29:58.075
and pray that Magnum and T.C.
do their job.

30:00.013 --> 30:01.844
Oh, my coat.

30:04.585 --> 30:05.711
Thank you very much.

30:18.131 --> 30:21.225
Prestige Limo. Ice Pick said
Prestige Limo. This is it!

30:42.189 --> 30:43.486
We better pull them over...

30:43.557 --> 30:44.888
before they get
close to the hotel.

30:44.958 --> 30:49.258
And what if they won't pull over, T.C.?
I'm not gonna take on a limo in this car.

30:51.798 --> 30:54.460
No problem. Pull alongside.

30:57.738 --> 30:59.968
Honk your horn.
What are you going to do?

31:00.040 --> 31:01.564
Honk your horn.

31:06.280 --> 31:07.941
Pull over! Police!

31:08.282 --> 31:10.682
Police? In a Ferrari?

31:22.829 --> 31:26.526
Freeze! Don't move a muscle or
I'll put a bullet through it.

31:34.007 --> 31:36.840
Special Investigator Fenady,
you're under arrest.

31:37.678 --> 31:39.373
What's the charge, Officer?

31:39.446 --> 31:43.212
Speeding, reckless driving,
endangering another vehicle...

31:45.953 --> 31:47.818
and impersonating an officer.

31:50.324 --> 31:52.849
Mr. Osborne,
can you handle eight kilos?

31:55.195 --> 31:58.460
Things are slow right now. Might take
us a couple of days to move the stuff.

32:01.134 --> 32:03.261
Where are these eight kilos?

32:03.937 --> 32:08.397
They'll be here soon. But they
don't come up till I get the money.

32:15.182 --> 32:16.513
Very nice.

32:17.751 --> 32:20.083
People'll pay through
the nose for this stuff.

32:23.190 --> 32:25.420
Let Kono get it.
Just my guys calling to say...

32:25.492 --> 32:27.619
that the shipment's arrived.

32:28.228 --> 32:29.320
Yeah.

32:30.931 --> 32:32.398
I understand.

32:38.638 --> 32:39.969
Something wrong?

32:40.540 --> 32:42.735
Nothing. The shipment's here.

32:42.809 --> 32:46.245
I've just gotta go down and
check it out. We'll be right back.

33:00.961 --> 33:02.360
How do you think it's going?

33:02.429 --> 33:04.727
Oh, couldn't be
better. You two are terrific.

33:05.232 --> 33:07.632
Soon as they come through the
door, we're gonna nail them.

33:08.602 --> 33:09.899
Freeze!

33:14.641 --> 33:16.233
Oh, my God.

33:23.150 --> 33:25.778
I knew this
wouldn't work. I knew it!

33:25.919 --> 33:29.753
And because of this dumb plan,
I missed my game again!

33:29.823 --> 33:31.188
Oh, Magnum, shut up!

33:31.258 --> 33:33.556
Now Reese'll have to lead
the guys to victory.

33:33.627 --> 33:35.185
Who's Reese?
Kenneth Reese.

33:35.262 --> 33:37.321
He was my backup quarterback
at the academy...

33:37.397 --> 33:40.127
and he's been waiting for a
chance like this since 1963...

33:40.200 --> 33:41.929
and now he's got it,
because of you!

33:42.669 --> 33:45.934
All of you! It's all your fault!
Magnum, stop living in the past.

33:46.006 --> 33:48.133
Me? Me? Higgins...

33:48.308 --> 33:51.300
you've enshrined yours. You
quote every boring war story...

33:51.378 --> 33:53.039
like it was carved in stone.

33:53.613 --> 33:54.637
Boring?

33:54.714 --> 33:56.739
Don't worry, Higgins,
I like your stories.

33:56.883 --> 33:58.350
Yeah, me, too.

33:58.652 --> 34:01.177
I do think I tell them
with a certain panache.

34:02.022 --> 34:04.149
Yeah. Well, where's Carol?

34:04.257 --> 34:05.656
When's she gonna
get us out of here?

34:05.725 --> 34:08.420
Just be thankful that she
wasn't discovered, too.

34:08.495 --> 34:11.396
Thankful? Higgins, she's the one who
cooked up this harebrained scheme...

34:11.465 --> 34:12.726
with your help.

34:12.799 --> 34:14.426
Well...

34:15.702 --> 34:20.036
I think it was a good plan.
T.C., we are in jail!

34:20.107 --> 34:23.543
Rick and Higgins are here on drug charges.
Do you know how serious that is?

34:25.245 --> 34:29.875
Yeah, but we did it for a friend,
and that is all that matters.

34:30.350 --> 34:33.183
Well, she's not exactly running
to our rescue. Where is she?

34:34.920 --> 34:36.411
Here she comes now.

34:43.196 --> 34:44.754
It's about time you got here.

34:47.300 --> 34:49.130
These are the guys
who say they know you.

34:51.071 --> 34:52.231
Hi, Carol.

34:53.106 --> 34:55.199
I've never seen these men
before in my life.

35:07.035 --> 35:09.629
Right now,
they're playing the rematch...

35:09.705 --> 35:13.664
of the 1967 Army-Navy game
without me!

35:14.609 --> 35:19.546
It's all you guys' fault. And
Carol's. After all I did for her.

35:21.049 --> 35:22.949
Man, this is worse than
capital punishment.

35:23.018 --> 35:24.542
Magnum, please,
must you go on...

35:24.619 --> 35:27.213
you're making all of us
quite ill. I don't care!

35:27.889 --> 35:30.016
Wait till I get my hands
on her, I'll...

35:30.092 --> 35:33.858
Wright, Calvin, Higgins, Magnum.

35:34.229 --> 35:36.720
You guys are out of here.
Your bail arrived.

35:36.798 --> 35:40.529
Carol Douglas? A guy in
Zurich named Robin Masters.

35:40.602 --> 35:42.126
Hey, all right!

35:43.271 --> 35:45.569
I put my phone call to good use.

36:11.266 --> 36:12.858
I never want to see you again.

36:14.336 --> 36:16.964
Wait a minute.
Let me explain.

36:18.406 --> 36:19.634
Please.

36:23.311 --> 36:25.836
Two minutes,
and this better be good.

36:35.457 --> 36:38.551
I knew my boss wasn't messed up
with Clinton right from the start.

36:39.461 --> 36:42.191
He wanted to bust him, too. In fact, we
were sort of in competition over it...

36:42.264 --> 36:45.233
because a bust like that can
mean big political Brownie points.

36:45.300 --> 36:46.665
Is that why he fired you?

36:47.869 --> 36:49.461
No, not exactly.

36:52.007 --> 36:53.804
Why are you being so vague,
Carol?

36:53.875 --> 36:55.308
Well...

36:58.613 --> 37:00.205
I wasn't really fired.

37:01.216 --> 37:02.376
What?

37:08.356 --> 37:12.417
You mean,
this was all a big con?

37:13.228 --> 37:17.255
A big con just to suck me and
Higgins and everybody else in?

37:18.333 --> 37:19.391
Yes.

37:21.036 --> 37:25.268
Stanton told me to stay off the
case, Thomas. He started harassing me.

37:25.340 --> 37:28.901
So I took a vacation and conducted
my own private investigation.

37:29.411 --> 37:31.106
Boy, that makes me mad.

37:31.780 --> 37:34.578
How could you do that? I believed
you, that you were upset...

37:34.649 --> 37:36.048
and drunk.
I was upset.

37:36.117 --> 37:37.243
And drunk?

37:39.087 --> 37:40.952
How could you do that?
How could you use...

37:41.022 --> 37:43.149
and manipulate
your friends like that?

37:43.225 --> 37:46.058
I've watched you, Thomas,
and I've learned.

37:46.928 --> 37:48.759
You're about the
best I've ever seen.

37:50.632 --> 37:54.033
Not that it's something to be proud of.
I don't know what you're talking about.

37:54.102 --> 37:55.433
Yes, you do.

37:55.503 --> 37:58.631
You send Rick all over the island
running down license plates...

37:58.707 --> 38:00.607
or getting information
from Ice Pick.

38:00.675 --> 38:02.370
T.C.'s helicopter
has bullet holes...

38:02.444 --> 38:05.641
all over it from your missions and you
don't even offer to pay for the gas.

38:05.714 --> 38:06.976
Your two minutes are up.

38:07.048 --> 38:10.108
And Higgins, he's been tricked,
God knows how many times.

38:10.819 --> 38:14.152
And me. Every time I offer to
help, I'm risking my career.

38:14.256 --> 38:16.850
And then there's Lieutenant
Poole, and poor MacReynolds.

38:16.925 --> 38:19.553
For goodness sakes, you put
20 extra pounds on that guy.

38:20.495 --> 38:22.588
Bringing up Mac is not fair.

38:22.697 --> 38:24.096
But it's true.

38:29.137 --> 38:30.365
Well...

38:32.440 --> 38:33.839
it's always for a good cause.

38:33.909 --> 38:36.434
But mine was for
a good cause, too, Thomas.

38:36.511 --> 38:39.776
The only thing I feel bad about
is how serious it got. I never...

38:39.848 --> 38:42.248
never meant to put you all
in so much danger.

38:43.585 --> 38:46.418
I just thought maybe you could
help me and still get to your game.

38:48.823 --> 38:50.017
Well...

38:51.159 --> 38:53.150
I guess it almost worked.

38:54.296 --> 38:57.732
But what about last night?
Why didn't you bail us out?

38:57.799 --> 39:00.267
Because I had to keep the whole
charade with Clinton alive.

39:00.335 --> 39:03.361
I still have the tape I made.
That's enough to bust him.

39:06.074 --> 39:09.168
Have you told your boss?
I haven't told anybody.

39:09.678 --> 39:11.509
I still don't know
where the leak is.

39:11.846 --> 39:15.077
I've got Officer Fenady getting
a John Doe arrest warrant for me.

39:15.150 --> 39:17.675
And when he comes to pick me
up at my house this afternoon...

39:17.752 --> 39:21.017
I'll tell him where we're
going. Until then no one knows.

39:23.658 --> 39:26.889
Today is gonna be the
biggest day of my career...

39:28.196 --> 39:29.527
and I owe it all to you.

39:34.836 --> 39:36.098
No...

39:38.940 --> 39:40.134
it's your day.

39:41.276 --> 39:43.039
Oh, Thomas.

39:56.324 --> 39:59.623
I'm sorry you missed
your reunion and the rematch.

40:01.663 --> 40:04.131
I hope this will
make it up to you.

40:12.273 --> 40:16.471
First class? It's the only
seat left going to L.A. today.

40:16.578 --> 40:18.478
I couldn't even get
anything on the redeye.

40:19.114 --> 40:20.979
But what the hell,
you're worth it.

40:25.387 --> 40:27.548
Thanks for taking
me to the airport, T.C.

40:27.622 --> 40:28.850
Hey, no problem.

40:30.058 --> 40:33.050
And I'm sorry about
the way I acted before. I...

40:34.896 --> 40:37.456
Forget it. We're just glad
you're getting out of town.

40:38.199 --> 40:40.463
And I want you to know
that I'm gonna pay you back...

40:40.535 --> 40:43.163
for every gallon of fuel
I've burned in the helicopter.

40:45.106 --> 40:48.166
Did you
recognize that John Fenady?

40:48.943 --> 40:50.535
Oh, the guy who arrested us?

40:50.612 --> 40:52.739
Yeah, he looked
kind of familiar.

40:52.947 --> 40:55.711
He played shortstop for the
lllegitimates last year.

40:57.085 --> 40:58.712
Yeah, now I remember him.

40:59.888 --> 41:02.686
You should. He robbed you of two
clean singles through the hole.

41:02.757 --> 41:04.019
Yeah, he was quick.

41:04.092 --> 41:06.151
He's so quick,
they nicknamed him "The Cat."

41:09.898 --> 41:11.229
"The Cat"?

41:13.234 --> 41:18.001
That's why the plan didn't
work. El Gato. Fenady is El Gato!

41:27.382 --> 41:28.542
No!

42:11.559 --> 42:12.753
Thomas!

43:04.412 --> 43:06.039
Give me! Give me!

43:12.921 --> 43:14.081
You all right?

43:15.924 --> 43:16.982
Yes.

43:18.259 --> 43:19.783
He's got the Clinton tape.

43:20.762 --> 43:21.854
Hey!

43:31.372 --> 43:34.933
<i>In that Army-Navy
game, where I went 21 for 30...</i>

43:35.009 --> 43:37.876
<i>one of the passes I missed
was intercepted.</i>

43:37.946 --> 43:41.814
<i>The fastest man on the Army team
caught it and he got past everybody...</i>

43:41.950 --> 43:45.477
<i>until I was the only guy left that
had a chance to catch him.</i>

43:45.553 --> 43:48.351
<i>The guy was faster than me,
and I knew it.</i>

43:48.790 --> 43:51.987
<i>But I wasn't going to
get beat by my own mistake.</i>

44:03.271 --> 44:05.330
<i>And that's a
happy group of midshipmen...</i>

44:05.406 --> 44:06.464
<i>ladies and gentlemen...</i>

44:06.541 --> 44:08.907
<i>as the last few seconds tick
off here at the Rose Bowl.</i>

44:08.977 --> 44:12.037
<i>There's the gun. And the
final score from Pasadena...</i>

44:12.113 --> 44:14.911
<i>Navy has done it again,
42 to 13.</i>

44:15.316 --> 44:17.546
I can't understand
what happened to Thomas.

44:18.019 --> 44:21.477
Well, he said he was going to get a
couple of six-packs of Old Düsseldorf...

44:21.556 --> 44:22.921
and he'd be right back.

44:31.266 --> 44:32.426
I missed it, didn't I?

44:33.434 --> 44:34.560
Yep.

44:37.305 --> 44:40.502
I can't believe it.
What happened to you?

44:44.279 --> 44:47.737
I went to the only store on this side of
the island that carries Old Düsseldorf...

44:47.815 --> 44:51.342
and they were out, so I had to
drive way over on the other side.

44:51.419 --> 44:54.877
It wouldn't be the same watching
the game without Old Düsseldorf...

44:54.956 --> 44:57.424
and then when I finally came out of
the liquor store somebody'd ripped...

44:57.492 --> 45:00.928
the radio out of the car and I
couldn't even listen to the game.

45:02.430 --> 45:06.423
Well, I know I shouldn't ask
this, but, why are you all muddy?

45:06.668 --> 45:11.071
Well, I tried to hurry back
and I drove too fast...

45:11.472 --> 45:13.838
It was raining.
You wrecked the Ferrari?

45:13.908 --> 45:17.139
No. I drove it off the road
and got stuck in the mud.

45:17.211 --> 45:18.678
Oh, Thomas.

45:18.746 --> 45:20.680
And then
the tow truck took two hours...

45:20.748 --> 45:24.707
and the driver doesn't like
football, and he listens to opera...

45:27.622 --> 45:29.021
Could you all leave now?

45:30.458 --> 45:32.187
I wanna be alone.

45:34.595 --> 45:35.789
Don't you wanna know who won?

45:36.264 --> 45:38.027
Who?
Don't tell him.

45:40.635 --> 45:44.093
Carol figured you might be late,
so she taped the game for you.

45:45.039 --> 45:46.131
What?

45:47.942 --> 45:49.466
Carol!

45:50.211 --> 45:53.112
<i>Voilà.</i>
Really? Thank you!

45:56.050 --> 45:59.315
Thank you. I'll never
forget you for this.

46:00.922 --> 46:02.184
Now, everyone get out!

46:03.324 --> 46:04.882
But.
- No buts! No buts!

46:04.959 --> 46:08.417
I don't want anyone even
hinting at an outcome. Get out!

46:08.596 --> 46:11.224
Bye, Thomas.
Thank you, get out.

46:12.967 --> 46:14.958
It wasn't even close.
Get out!

46:16.371 --> 46:18.703
Thank you. Thank you.

46:35.423 --> 46:37.857
<i>And here comes Navy!</i>

46:41.429 --> 46:45.661
<i>It's an aroused squad of midshipmen who
are gathering around their coaches...</i>

46:46.000 --> 46:49.333
Magnum, what have you got
to say for yourself?

46:49.504 --> 46:51.096
Come in and be quiet.
I'm watching the game.

46:51.172 --> 46:54.005
The Ferrari is literally
encased in mud.

46:55.643 --> 46:59.807
Higgins, I am not going to
even make up a story for you.

46:59.881 --> 47:01.542
I ran the car off the road.
You ran off-

47:01.616 --> 47:04.915
And, Higgins, and someone
stole the radio out of it.

47:04.986 --> 47:08.581
Now, that's what happened. I'm sorry.
There's nothing I can do about it...

47:08.656 --> 47:11.921
so if you'll just excuse me,
I'm gonna watch my game.

47:11.993 --> 47:15.588
Any rational, responsible human being
would be making every effort to remedy...

47:15.663 --> 47:17.961
the condition of that car.
I'm not listening, Higgins.

47:18.032 --> 47:22.025
Instead, you sit here mesmerized by
this primitive display of brute force...

47:22.103 --> 47:25.698
42...

47:25.773 --> 47:28.037
Higgins!
Army: 13.

47:28.109 --> 47:29.701
<i>Let's have a good, clean game.</i>

47:29.777 --> 47:31.870
<i>Now, Navy has
won the toss and as expected...</i>

47:31.946 --> 47:34.437
<i>will take the kickoff at
the east end of the field...</i>

47:34.515 --> 47:37.484
<i>before over 90,000
here in Pasadena...</i>

47:37.552 --> 47:41.511
<i>it's Army-Navy, and it
promises to be a great game!</i>
