00:02.213 --> 00:06.920
<i>I'm not sick but I'm not well</i>

00:06.970 --> 00:09.961
<i>...And I'm so hot</i>

00:10.009 --> 00:14.523
<i>Cos I'm in he-ell...</i>

00:20.244 --> 00:25.236
Another hard day, eh, Jez? Watching
kids' TV and eating kids' cereal?

00:25.282 --> 00:28.716
What should I be having?
Gentleman's relish with olives?

00:28.760 --> 00:31.716
Crunchy Nut Corn Flakes
are Frosties for wankers.

00:31.758 --> 00:35.715
Frosties are Corn Flakes for people
who can't face reality.

00:35.756 --> 00:37.712
Anything from Soph?

00:37.755 --> 00:41.144
She's been very busy,
far too busy for post.

00:41.194 --> 00:44.741
Don't think she'll actually be
coming down over the weekend.

00:44.792 --> 00:47.703
It's just there's this thing.

00:47.751 --> 00:49.388
Sounds important.

00:49.430 --> 00:51.738
What am I gonna do, Jez?

00:51.789 --> 00:55.018
- She's slipping through my fingers.
- Tell her you love her.

00:55.067 --> 01:00.422
That's like firing first in a duel.
If you miss, you're fucked.

01:00.464 --> 01:05.013
It puts you in the driving seat -
sometimes I tell them I love them

01:05.062 --> 01:08.576
on a first date, just to get things
off to a good start.

01:08.620 --> 01:10.814
Doesn't that devalue it a bit?

01:10.859 --> 01:12.577
No. Maybe.

01:12.619 --> 01:15.415
A bit. Who cares? It works.

01:15.457 --> 01:18.607
- Aren't you going to open your post?
- No, it's boring.

01:18.656 --> 01:21.771
"You may have won this."
Who cares?

01:21.814 --> 01:25.044
That one's On Her Majesty's Service,
for God's sake.

01:25.092 --> 01:29.845
Oh, sure, it's On Her Majesty's
Service, delivered by the Royal Mail.

01:29.890 --> 01:33.676
Probably an invitation to one of
Princess Anne's dogging parties.

01:33.728 --> 01:37.402
See? Now they want me to do
jury service.

01:37.446 --> 01:42.598
Jury service? I can't believe they'd
choose you! Must be a mistake.

01:42.644 --> 01:45.157
Why shouldn't I do jury service?

01:45.203 --> 01:47.477
Because your... critical facult...

01:47.522 --> 01:52.115
I'm not being rude, but you're not
a very logical thinker.

01:52.159 --> 01:53.274
No, I wouldn't.

01:53.319 --> 01:56.832
You still don't understand what
happened in Ocean's Eleven, do you?

01:56.877 --> 01:58.195
It's a complicated film.

01:58.236 --> 01:59.464
It really isn't.

01:59.516 --> 02:04.746
I'd probably find jury service
simple. I'll just let them off.

02:04.793 --> 02:06.589
Don't try and upset me.

02:06.632 --> 02:11.101
Some black kid accused of stealing
a bun, and I'm gonna set him free.

02:11.150 --> 02:13.868
Wait till you hear the details!

02:13.909 --> 02:18.105
That's what they want you to do -
confuse you. I'll definitely acquit.

02:21.145 --> 02:26.217
I'm shaking up the department, and
I want you two to be my enforcers.

02:26.263 --> 02:29.412
My Cheech and Chong.
My Skinner and Baddiel.

02:29.461 --> 02:31.735
The iron fists inside my velvet glove.

02:31.780 --> 02:34.452
The spiky balls on the end of my stick.

02:34.499 --> 02:35.851
Nice, yes.

02:35.898 --> 02:39.571
Which one of you two
is balling Sophie right now?

02:39.616 --> 02:42.368
He is. Well, theoretically.

02:42.415 --> 02:45.405
She's not getting on all that well in Bristol.

02:45.453 --> 02:49.967
'lf everything goes wrong,
I'll be there to pick up the pieces.'

02:50.011 --> 02:51.490
She's been slacking off.

02:51.530 --> 02:55.760
Apparently, she called Colin Cooper
a dickhead.

02:55.808 --> 02:57.718
Well, he is a dickhead.

02:57.767 --> 03:01.441
Mark, maybe you could have a word?

03:01.486 --> 03:05.557
Get her to clean up her act?
Unofficial verbal warning. Cool?

03:05.604 --> 03:07.559
Oh, OK, sure.

03:08.402 --> 03:10.596
'Bollocks. Could be difficult.

03:10.641 --> 03:12.949
'Or tell her I love her,

03:13.000 --> 03:18.072
'then before it gets too soppy,
hit her with a disciplinary matter.'

03:18.118 --> 03:22.950
Jez! So, first day in court,
tell me everything.

03:22.995 --> 03:27.145
I've taken a solemn oath.
I take it quite seriously.

03:27.193 --> 03:30.979
I could get a fried chicken bucket
from a properly franchised outlet,

03:31.031 --> 03:32.544
not the one
that gave you that fever.

03:32.591 --> 03:36.786
It's credit card fraud, a woman.
Four in Nescliffe, two in Cosford.

03:36.828 --> 03:38.580
Credit card fraud?!

03:38.628 --> 03:42.141
Nescliffe?! A woman?!
Oh, my God, this is incredible!

03:42.186 --> 03:45.540
Oh, sure, it sounds incredible
for the first three hours.

03:45.584 --> 03:48.097
God, it's boring.
"Are you guilty? Blah, blah, blah."

03:48.143 --> 03:50.417
It's a joke, she's obviously guilty.

03:50.462 --> 03:53.850
Why? Has she taken the stand?
What's her alibi?

03:53.900 --> 03:56.174
She looks shifty.

03:56.219 --> 03:57.651
Shifty?

03:57.698 --> 04:03.089
Wouldn't look out of place with a can of
lager and a cheap fag in her mouth.

04:03.136 --> 04:06.763
- You were going to acquit.
- She's white.

04:06.814 --> 04:08.769
And another jury bloke thinks the same.

04:08.813 --> 04:11.167
No smoke without fire.

04:11.212 --> 04:15.885
Is that what 1,000 years of the
English judicial system comes to?

04:15.929 --> 04:17.885
No smoke without fire?!

04:17.928 --> 04:20.440
She's going down.
And if she didn't do it, so what?

04:20.487 --> 04:24.398
She's the type, she'd probably
just do something else.

04:26.484 --> 04:31.476
'Ah, soup. Lovely hug in a mug.
All I need now is a kiss in a tube.

04:31.522 --> 04:35.479
'A wank in a packet.
Better call Sophie. Or maybe...

04:35.520 --> 04:40.194
'Just before, play solitaire
for three hours. Shit, it's her! '

04:40.238 --> 04:42.273
Hello, Sophie?

04:42.317 --> 04:45.830
'Hi, Mark! Listen, good news.
I'm coming down tonight.

04:45.875 --> 04:48.104
'Can we hang out? I miss you.'

04:48.154 --> 04:50.950
Of course, I miss you too.

04:50.992 --> 04:54.108
Although, tonight,
you do know it's Thursday?

04:54.151 --> 04:55.708
'I'll pull a sickie tomorrow.'

04:55.750 --> 04:59.627
'Johnson's right,
she's dangerously out of control.'

04:59.668 --> 05:02.977
'So, I'll come over
about seven-ish? '

05:03.027 --> 05:06.734
Brilliant. Bye.
'Shit. Bottled it.

05:06.785 --> 05:10.219
'Tell her tonight after chicken
and wine and Sara Lee.

05:10.263 --> 05:13.459
'Maybe I could get some
chocolate-flavour condoms.

05:13.502 --> 05:16.537
'I'll be more relaxed with my penis
as a novelty item.'

05:18.219 --> 05:23.086
'Why couldn't I get something
interesting, like a cat-strangling,

05:23.137 --> 05:26.571
'or a murder case that goes
at the heart of government?

05:26.615 --> 05:28.844
'Oh, my God, the defendant.'

05:28.894 --> 05:32.328
Do I know you?
God, you're on the jury, aren't you?

05:32.372 --> 05:35.249
Yeah. Yeah, I am a bit. Sorry.

05:35.291 --> 05:36.689
Wow, this is weird.

05:36.730 --> 05:39.243
Yup! I probably shouldn't...

05:39.289 --> 05:40.607
I shouldn't, probably.

05:40.648 --> 05:43.957
To be honest, it's nice
to get away from the jury.

05:44.007 --> 05:46.042
All they want to talk about is the case.

05:46.086 --> 05:49.281
What are they saying about it, then?

05:49.324 --> 05:53.076
Oh, just...
We all think you're innocent.

05:53.122 --> 05:54.396
Really?!

05:54.442 --> 05:56.511
'Just sugar the pill a bit.'

05:56.561 --> 05:59.232
What's your name?

05:59.279 --> 06:00.394
Jeremy.

06:00.439 --> 06:02.349
Pleased to meet you. I'm Carla.

06:02.398 --> 06:07.515
I'll be glad when this is all over.
Those wooden chairs kill my back.

06:07.555 --> 06:12.547
That's why I sit in the corner,
because you can lean on the wall,

06:12.593 --> 06:15.231
and you know... It's just better.

06:15.271 --> 06:16.829
What about that judge, though, eh?

06:16.871 --> 06:20.544
God, yeah. He's so judgemental.
"I rule this," "I rule that".

06:20.589 --> 06:24.466
That would be a good name
for him, Judge Mental!

06:24.507 --> 06:29.579
Hey, I tell you what, I plead guilty
to wanting a moccaccino!

06:29.625 --> 06:30.534
Objection!

06:30.584 --> 06:32.539
Overruled!

06:32.583 --> 06:35.779
'This isn't wrong, just... illegal.
Like drink-driving.'

06:38.020 --> 06:40.249
You'd think she'd come up
with a better alibi than that.

06:40.299 --> 06:45.325
"'I'm the foreman, I'm the foreman.
Only I get to talk to the judge."

06:45.377 --> 06:47.048
'Fuck you.'

06:50.414 --> 06:53.246
'Jesus, it gets better and better! '

06:53.293 --> 06:56.522
All those who think she's guilty
raise a hand.

06:56.571 --> 07:01.199
'They can't send her down, they
don't know her. I don't know her.

07:01.249 --> 07:03.716
'But I do fancy her.'

07:03.768 --> 07:07.839
Er, yeah, I just don't think
she is that guilty.

07:07.886 --> 07:11.001
I think there is a reasonable doubt.

07:11.044 --> 07:14.752
'I'm in Twelve Angry Men.
I'm the only one who's not angry.

07:14.803 --> 07:18.032
'I'm horny. That's much nicer.'

07:20.200 --> 07:23.668
We'll eat and laugh
and I'll make out I think

07:23.718 --> 07:27.391
Colin Cooper's a dickhead too,
when actually he's doing

07:27.436 --> 07:31.552
bloody good work with a difficult
team and some very testing targets.

07:33.713 --> 07:36.101
What's funny?

07:36.152 --> 07:38.062
Oh, nothing. Doesn't matter.

07:38.111 --> 07:40.783
Is it something to do with the case?

07:40.830 --> 07:43.059
Er, yeah, it is, kind of.

07:43.109 --> 07:44.746
What's going on?

07:44.788 --> 07:48.222
It's really...
Honestly, it's nothing.

07:48.266 --> 07:51.894
They haven't found the missing
security tapes from Ryman's?

07:51.945 --> 07:54.218
No, no, it's nothing like that.

07:54.263 --> 07:56.730
Anyway, she's definitely innocent.

07:56.782 --> 07:59.090
Why, what came out? What happened?

07:59.141 --> 08:05.373
Nothing came out, it's just... I got to know her
a bit and she wouldn't do it.

08:05.418 --> 08:07.533
You got to know her a bit?

08:07.577 --> 08:11.727
We bumped into each other, we've
been texting, we're going out for a drink.

08:11.775 --> 08:16.289
For God's sake, Jeremy,
it's against the law.

08:16.333 --> 08:19.528
The only seat in the cafe
was next to her.

08:19.571 --> 08:24.245
Should I blank her? That's against the law.
The law of social niceness.

08:24.289 --> 08:28.519
You've got to tell her
you can't meet up for a drink.

08:28.567 --> 08:33.318
So suddenly I can't go out drinking
with the defendant? Why not?

08:33.364 --> 08:36.321
People might think
you'd be less impartial

08:36.363 --> 08:39.352
if you're trying to bone the woman
you're meant to judging.

08:39.400 --> 08:41.073
Typical.

08:41.121 --> 08:44.191
"Jeremy can't be trusted to judge
the woman he's sleeping with but...

08:44.239 --> 08:47.196
"but Tony Blair can." Yeah?

08:47.238 --> 08:48.750
It's contempt of court.

08:48.797 --> 08:52.629
Look, Mark, I'm a musician,
in case you'd forgotten.

08:52.675 --> 08:56.063
I answer to a higher law,
the law of, "If it feels good, do it."

08:56.113 --> 09:00.024
Oh, that's a great law!
What's that, Gaddafi's law?

09:00.071 --> 09:02.106
It's the musicians' law.

09:05.309 --> 09:08.583
Colonel Gaddafi could not
lay down a bass hook, Mark.

09:08.627 --> 09:11.584
That should be clear even to you.

09:11.626 --> 09:13.377
God.

09:13.425 --> 09:16.381
Sophie! The Sophster! Sophistry!

09:17.303 --> 09:20.611
Soph! Great to... see you.

09:20.661 --> 09:25.414
Hi, Mark! So good to see you!
How are you, you big lovely? Dom.

09:25.459 --> 09:27.096
Hiya.

09:27.138 --> 09:29.526
Hi, Dom. Really great to meet you.

09:29.577 --> 09:34.490
'I suppose Dom's gonna have sex with
Sophie while I film it on my phone.'

09:34.535 --> 09:40.050
Sorry, that's me. Sorry,
I'm really gonna have to take this.

09:40.092 --> 09:41.570
Isn't he fab?!

09:41.611 --> 09:46.842
'He's gay! He's obviously gay.
My God, I actually have gaydar.

09:46.889 --> 09:49.606
'ls he going? I hope he's going.

09:49.647 --> 09:53.524
'Shutting the door might be
a bit aggressive if he's not.'

09:53.685 --> 09:55.481
So how are you?

09:55.524 --> 09:58.879
Oh, good, thanks. You look great.

09:58.923 --> 10:03.755
Thanks! Do you like my hair? Shaylee
did it, she works in the juice bar.

10:03.800 --> 10:06.996
She does Indian head massage too.
God, it's orgasmic!

10:07.039 --> 10:11.189
'Juice bar? Massage? Orgasm?!
That's everything I stand against! '

10:11.237 --> 10:15.547
Hey, that was Olly. He wants to meet
up for cocktails at the Lava Lounge.

10:15.595 --> 10:16.583
What do you think?

10:16.634 --> 10:19.989
You'd love Olly,
he's such a great laugh.

10:20.033 --> 10:26.662
That sounds great, it's just...
I've made chicken, I've got wine.

10:26.709 --> 10:30.985
I've got DVDs.
Ocean's Twelve and Meet The Fockers.

10:31.027 --> 10:33.984
Er, we did see those at the cinema.

10:34.026 --> 10:36.822
It's like a reminiscipackage.

10:36.864 --> 10:40.821
Plus there's commentaries,
outtakes, bloopers...

10:40.862 --> 10:43.136
Ooh, just come for one cocktail.

10:43.181 --> 10:48.697
Olly freaked out. Oh, come on, he loves
you. He'll puke if you don't come.

10:48.739 --> 10:51.012
What do you think, Mark? lt'd be fun.

10:51.057 --> 10:56.413
Er, well, I guess I'd hate to be
responsible for someone

10:56.455 --> 10:59.684
actually throwing up, so...
Yeah, great.

10:59.733 --> 11:03.690
'You win this one, Sophie,
but I will have my revenge.

11:03.731 --> 11:06.881
'All Sunday at the National
Maritime Museum.'

11:08.649 --> 11:11.287
'One cocktail.
That was the arrangement.

11:11.328 --> 11:16.479
'One cocktail, then home. Not four
cocktails and off to a gay club.'

11:16.525 --> 11:19.755
Carla can't make it
but she'll meet us here instead.

11:19.804 --> 11:22.919
Great. 'Trapped all night with
the homos and the criminals.

11:22.962 --> 11:26.839
'Like prison, but without even
my own cell.'

11:26.880 --> 11:30.757
Mark, if he asks, just say you're gay.
What?!

11:30.798 --> 11:32.708
You been here before, mate?

11:32.757 --> 11:34.031
You gay, pal?

11:34.077 --> 11:37.033
'Lie. Say yes, say yes.' No.

11:37.075 --> 11:40.907
No, I'm not. God, sorry.

11:40.953 --> 11:43.830
I did once have this thing with a...

11:43.872 --> 11:46.510
I had these feelings,
but it was complicated.

11:46.551 --> 11:50.178
It was more a sort of atmosphere,
nothing ever really...

11:50.229 --> 11:53.264
Sexuality's a sort of a spectrum,
not a black and...

11:53.307 --> 11:55.774
Go on. Fuck off. In you go.

11:55.826 --> 11:59.180
There are a lot of gay guys
in there tonight?

11:59.224 --> 12:01.578
Great. Brilliant.

12:04.702 --> 12:09.614
'God, how did I end up here?
Will I ever be allowed to leave?

12:09.659 --> 12:12.172
'Just got to ride the alienation.'

12:12.218 --> 12:13.855
Are you having a good time?

12:13.897 --> 12:15.250
Oh, yeah, wicked.

12:15.297 --> 12:16.854
So how did you guys meet?

12:16.896 --> 12:18.931
Oh, that's quite funny, actually.

12:18.975 --> 12:20.202
A trial.

12:20.254 --> 12:22.084
Are you a lawyer?

12:22.133 --> 12:24.362
I'm the defendant.

12:24.412 --> 12:26.288
And I'm on the jury!

12:26.331 --> 12:31.767
And the funniest part is,
the trial isn't even over yet!

12:31.809 --> 12:32.923
Oh, my God!

12:32.968 --> 12:34.195
That is so weird!

12:34.247 --> 12:38.602
'I'm just a stick in the mud for
thinking it's anything other than

12:38.645 --> 12:40.600
'one of those brilliant urban jokes.'

12:40.644 --> 12:45.272
Jez, if I need the bog, this place,
its official classification is

12:45.322 --> 12:46.834
"gay-friendly"?

12:46.881 --> 12:48.950
Yep, gay, gay-friendly.

12:49.000 --> 12:52.673
Does that mean friendly gays,
or friendly to the gays?

12:52.718 --> 12:57.665
Cos, to be honest, friendly gays
sound... not worse, but, you know...

12:57.716 --> 13:00.593
You think you're irresistible!

13:00.635 --> 13:02.147
People...

13:02.194 --> 13:04.548
Men have looked at me.

13:04.593 --> 13:08.220
Yeah, well. Just don't go into that
corner cos that's where the guys

13:08.271 --> 13:10.738
who like tubby homophobes hang out.

13:10.790 --> 13:13.222
Another drink, everybody?

13:15.227 --> 13:17.262
Is... erm? That isn't...

13:17.306 --> 13:19.455
Is that your name?

13:19.505 --> 13:22.462
Yeah, it's a second marriage.
A bit complicated.

13:22.504 --> 13:24.061
Oh, right.

13:24.103 --> 13:26.411
The old... magic card.

13:26.462 --> 13:31.738
Well, you might think that,
but I couldn't possibly comment.

13:31.779 --> 13:34.292
'She sees something and she takes it.

13:34.338 --> 13:37.693
'None of the "Is this mine
or someone else's?" crap.'

13:37.736 --> 13:40.693
You know what, Carla?

13:40.735 --> 13:42.452
I think I love you.

13:42.494 --> 13:44.768
You hardly know me.

13:44.813 --> 13:49.362
So what? I'm a musician.
I speak with my heart.

13:49.411 --> 13:51.878
'Yep, Jailhouse Rock.'

13:51.930 --> 13:55.841
I've got four brown bears
and a couple of Foghorn Leghorns.

13:55.888 --> 13:57.400
Mark, are you interested?

13:57.447 --> 14:00.482
Er... I'm not really sure I...

14:00.525 --> 14:04.914
I know it's not really your thing,
but it's really good fun.

14:04.963 --> 14:06.793
It's great.

14:06.842 --> 14:11.152
Is there not even a slim chance
that I might... die?

14:11.200 --> 14:13.588
I had an amazing time, you'll love it.

14:13.639 --> 14:16.630
I want you to love it. It'll be a special night.

14:16.678 --> 14:19.270
Yes. Of course. Sure.

14:19.316 --> 14:20.874
Take a Foghorn.

14:20.916 --> 14:25.032
They've got a nice, floaty launch
with a soft, crunchy landing.

14:25.073 --> 14:28.985
'A candle stuck in a wine bottle
doesn't cut it any more.

14:29.032 --> 14:34.467
'Now for a special night, you have
to have class-A drugs and fisting.'

14:37.388 --> 14:39.820
Mark, I'm so proud of you!

14:39.866 --> 14:43.903
'She's proud of me? For taking
a little white pill of drugs?

14:43.944 --> 14:47.413
'lf I'd fought at Goose Green,
she wouldn't want to know.'

14:47.463 --> 14:49.214
We are gonna have
such an amazing night.

14:49.262 --> 14:51.650
<i>'You are gonna have an amazing night.</i>

14:51.701 --> 14:56.726
'I am gonna have a very ordinary
night right under your stupid nose.'

14:59.177 --> 15:02.087
Who'd have thought it?
You and me out clubbing,

15:02.135 --> 15:07.082
you off your tits. I can genuinely see us
eventually reminiscing about this.

15:07.133 --> 15:11.488
Jez, listen, the thing is, I didn't actually
pop my pill. I'm pretending.

15:11.531 --> 15:15.886
I could do with a few pointers
on how to be a druggie.

15:15.929 --> 15:17.725
Why didn't you bang one?

15:17.768 --> 15:21.475
I don't want to be in a phone box
with a trucker's penis in my ear!

15:21.526 --> 15:23.720
That is so not the E experience.

15:23.765 --> 15:27.278
You're much more likely to wake up
with depression and a sense of worthlessness.

15:27.323 --> 15:31.951
That crap you talk when you're off
your noggin, I never really listen.

15:32.001 --> 15:35.787
What do you prattle on about,
and how shall I say I'm feeling?

15:35.839 --> 15:38.432
OK, look. When you're coming up,
it's kind of...

15:40.557 --> 15:42.626
Yeah? And then you're just...

15:42.676 --> 15:46.223
Everything you do is just kind of...

15:46.274 --> 15:48.548
And then when you're going down,

15:48.593 --> 15:53.426
you talk about how we're all the same
but these systems keep us apart.

15:53.471 --> 15:54.141
OK, thanks.

15:54.190 --> 15:57.067
Hey, Mark. Are you feeling it yet?

15:57.109 --> 15:58.860
Oh, yeah, I'm feeling...

16:00.587 --> 16:02.258
Really? Shall I get you some water?

16:02.306 --> 16:05.422
No, no, no, it's good,
everything's gone sort of bubbly.

16:05.465 --> 16:08.535
It's like I'm trapped
inside a giant Aero.

16:08.583 --> 16:10.493
I know exactly what you mean.

16:10.542 --> 16:15.056
I also think I might be getting
the famous munchies.

16:15.100 --> 16:18.886
Really? On an E?
I'll get you some water.

16:18.938 --> 16:23.452
I tell you what, me and you,
we've got a connection, haven't we?

16:23.496 --> 16:25.850
We're on the same wavelength, yeah?

16:25.895 --> 16:28.328
Oh, right, yeah!

16:28.374 --> 16:30.329
Listen to the music, man!

16:30.373 --> 16:33.443
This guy's a genius!
He's bringing it up.

16:33.491 --> 16:36.562
He's bringing it up.
Ooh, he's taking it down.

16:36.610 --> 16:38.327
He's taking it down.

16:38.369 --> 16:40.598
He's taking it up!

16:40.648 --> 16:41.397
Taking it up.

16:41.447 --> 16:42.482
Taking it up!

16:42.527 --> 16:44.596
Taking it down. Taking it down.

16:44.646 --> 16:46.283
Taking it down.

16:46.325 --> 16:48.918
'This guy is literally a moron.'

16:48.964 --> 16:50.954
You're on it, man. We're on it.

16:51.003 --> 16:52.833
We're brothers.

16:52.882 --> 16:53.518
Yeah.

16:54.961 --> 16:58.076
'Oh, God, the sweaty grip
of the moron.'

17:02.477 --> 17:04.512
Oh, yeah.

17:04.556 --> 17:07.671
You can feel it.
You can feel it, can't you?

17:07.714 --> 17:10.546
Yep, I can still feel it.

17:10.593 --> 17:13.550
'Oh, God, I'm so tired.'

17:13.592 --> 17:17.105
'How did my house become a rave? '
This is probably how a squat starts.

17:17.150 --> 17:21.346
'They'll never leave,
and they'll brick me up in my room

17:21.387 --> 17:23.662
'and ownership will pass to them
because a high court judge

17:23.707 --> 17:27.015
'will rule me to be officially
not living life to the max.'

17:27.065 --> 17:30.533
Soph, it's lovely, your incessant
rubbing of my back,

17:30.583 --> 17:32.618
but it is starting to chafe.

17:35.221 --> 17:37.495
The wine! The wine's been...!

17:37.540 --> 17:40.928
Mark, you OK?
You're not having a bad one?

17:40.978 --> 17:43.935
'Shit, too rational.'
Yeah, I'm fine.

17:43.977 --> 17:47.126
I just love being down here
on the carpet.

17:47.175 --> 17:48.926
The stain. Look at the pattern it's

17:48.974 --> 17:54.569
making as it soaks into my
genuine, pure wool carpet.

17:54.612 --> 17:56.283
Do you think I should
get me stuff...

17:56.331 --> 18:00.288
'What? She wants to talk normally
after what we just did? '

18:00.329 --> 18:02.888
'I like edgy sex,
but where was the humanity? '

18:02.928 --> 18:05.520
Hey! Check out the easy pickings.

18:05.566 --> 18:09.160
Yeah? Don't you think...

18:09.205 --> 18:11.081
We could blow this together, yeah?

18:11.124 --> 18:12.078
Do you think?

18:12.123 --> 18:16.433
Don't worry about him,
he's probably a banker on 300K.

18:16.481 --> 18:19.278
Yeah... I think he actually
works in a juice bar.

18:19.320 --> 18:20.547
Whatever.

18:20.599 --> 18:22.668
So, about the case.

18:22.718 --> 18:27.551
Just between us, the credit cards,
that was you, was it?

18:27.596 --> 18:30.666
No, Jez. That's the funny thing.
I wasn't even around for those.

18:30.714 --> 18:34.705
I was in Lincoln raking in a bit
on a housing benefit scam.

18:34.752 --> 18:36.821
Brilliant.

18:37.591 --> 18:40.342
Ooh, nasty scar.

18:40.389 --> 18:43.061
Bit of a bitch fight one night
in Sunderland. Still,

18:43.108 --> 18:49.260
you want to see the other girl,
cos she can't see you, not now!

18:49.305 --> 18:51.977
Brilliant.
'Oh, fuck.

18:52.024 --> 18:53.979
'This is getting a bit too real.'

18:54.023 --> 18:55.171
'Just keep kissing.

18:55.222 --> 18:57.781
'lf we're kissing,
she can't say scary stuff.'

19:00.540 --> 19:01.938
'Look at these drop-outs.'

19:01.979 --> 19:03.855
'They think they're having fun.'

19:03.898 --> 19:07.047
'lf we were agricultural workers,
the day would be half gone.'

19:07.096 --> 19:08.927
Are you all right, Soph?

19:08.976 --> 19:13.842
I don't know. The room's going a bit
spinny, and a think I might, erm...

19:13.893 --> 19:17.009
I burped some sick.
Can you get me out of here, Mark?

19:17.052 --> 19:22.203
OK. What you need is some
peace and quiet, and some rest.

19:22.249 --> 19:24.887
And a cup of tea and some
toast with peanut butter.

19:24.928 --> 19:26.724
That sounds nice.

19:26.767 --> 19:29.802
Soph, where you going?
We're going to have a spliff.

19:29.845 --> 19:31.800
Say hello to my little friend.

19:31.844 --> 19:36.518
She's going to bed. She doesn't want
any more of your drugs.

19:38.041 --> 19:40.793
You just have a nice lie-down.

19:40.840 --> 19:44.308
I'll bring the tea and toast
through in a minute, OK?

19:44.358 --> 19:47.076
Listen, do you want to...

19:47.117 --> 19:48.231
Again?

19:48.276 --> 19:49.755
Already?

19:49.796 --> 19:51.831
Yeah.
I'm in the mood for celebrating.

19:51.875 --> 19:55.343
In a few hours,
I'm going to be free as a bird.

19:55.393 --> 19:58.065
'Oh, no. She's going to go
free and come and live here,

19:58.112 --> 20:00.829
'and we'll have to do horrible
sex and go carjacking together.'

20:00.870 --> 20:03.463
Right, that's
it, turn the music down.

20:03.509 --> 20:07.022
You can stop smoking your drugs.
I'm making tea and toast for Sophie.

20:07.067 --> 20:09.455
I'm putting on Radio 4.
Everything's normal.

20:09.506 --> 20:13.133
I'm not really high, so you stop
talking your nonsense on my time.

20:13.184 --> 20:16.255
What's the problem, man?
Can't we just chill?

20:16.303 --> 20:19.373
No, you can't. You've been chilling
long enough. This is reality calling.

20:19.421 --> 20:22.730
But what about you and me?
The bond?

20:22.780 --> 20:25.292
There is no bond.
You're not a bad person,

20:25.338 --> 20:27.215
but I'm afraid to say
you are a moron.

20:27.257 --> 20:30.134
Pull your socks up and get
your shoes on. All of you.

20:30.176 --> 20:31.767
Oh, man!

20:31.815 --> 20:35.965
Listen, while we're at it, there are
systems for a reason in this world.

20:36.013 --> 20:38.731
Economic stability,
interest rates, growth.

20:38.772 --> 20:41.967
It's not a conspiracy to
keep you in little boxes.

20:42.010 --> 20:45.445
It's only the miracle of
consumer capitalism that means

20:45.489 --> 20:49.082
you're not lying in your own shit,
dying at 43 with rotten teeth,

20:49.127 --> 20:52.401
and a little pill with a chicken
on it is not going to change that.

20:52.445 --> 20:55.516
Now come on! Fuck off!

20:57.643 --> 21:01.759
'Bollocks. She's going to go free,
free to come round and cut me

21:01.801 --> 21:04.518
'from ear to ear unless I do
her evil doings with her.'

21:04.559 --> 21:08.516
So, maybe if we go over
the arguments one last time,

21:08.557 --> 21:11.946
then see if one of us
will change our minds.

21:11.996 --> 21:14.145
Why bother?
We're never going to agree.

21:14.195 --> 21:15.673
She's going to get off.

21:15.714 --> 21:18.386
Well, no, actually,
because the judge has ruled

21:18.433 --> 21:21.264
he'll accept a majority verdict.
If a couple of your lot

21:21.311 --> 21:23.744
will consider joining us,
then we can convict.

21:23.790 --> 21:25.427
'Shit. Could I do this?

21:25.469 --> 21:29.858
'She is technically innocent.
But, really, she's totally guilty.

21:29.907 --> 21:34.057
'Plus, women's prison, it's probably
like one long hen night.'

21:34.105 --> 21:37.096
Well, actually, I was thinking,

21:37.144 --> 21:41.339
I've had quite a big think
about everything and, um,

21:41.381 --> 21:45.214
I think I've changed my mind.

21:45.260 --> 21:47.136
Why? The security footage?

21:47.179 --> 21:50.533
Partially, but basically,

21:50.577 --> 21:53.170
I accidentally got
talking to her in a club.

21:53.216 --> 21:56.763
I know I shouldn't have,
but it turns out

21:56.814 --> 22:00.361
she does this sort of thing
all the time. She's a fraudster.

22:00.412 --> 22:01.891
No, we can't admit this.

22:01.931 --> 22:03.728
That grounds for a mistrial.

22:03.771 --> 22:05.522
OK, sure.

22:05.570 --> 22:09.163
If you want. Say it's a mistrial,
go crying to Daddy.

22:09.208 --> 22:11.437
But, look...

22:13.046 --> 22:16.162
maybe I didn't
play by the rules this time,

22:16.205 --> 22:19.957
maybe I am a bit of a maverick,

22:20.003 --> 22:22.754
but I think I've got this case
pretty much solved.

22:22.801 --> 22:27.509
And, yes, I can apologise for how
I've done that, but I could never

22:27.559 --> 22:34.792
apologise for telling the truth, and
the truth is that this woman is evil!

22:34.836 --> 22:37.951
If we let her go today,
we are going to be responsible for

22:37.994 --> 22:42.941
whatever she does, so help me God,
and let the Lord be my witness!

22:47.869 --> 22:50.018
OK, I buy it.

22:50.068 --> 22:51.739
Let's just say guilty.

22:51.787 --> 22:53.220
Yeah, I'm with him.

22:53.267 --> 22:55.416
'Oh, yeah, justice is done.

22:55.465 --> 22:59.423
'Not actual justice, but
what I wanted to happen,

22:59.464 --> 23:01.692
'which is
basically the same thing.'

23:02.782 --> 23:06.409
God, my head feels like a coconut
someone scraped out from the inside.

23:06.460 --> 23:08.734
Shit, yeah, I know how you feel...

23:08.779 --> 23:11.974
like a big sort of coconut
with a brain inside it.

23:13.417 --> 23:16.646
Whoops. Sorry, I'd better... Hello?

23:16.695 --> 23:19.288
'Mark, this is Allen.
I've spoken to Colin Cooper.

23:19.334 --> 23:22.324
'He's pissing blood. Apparently,
Sophie's pulled another sickie.

23:22.372 --> 23:26.568
'It's getting out of hand. Call her,
talk to her, do what you need to do.

23:26.610 --> 23:27.565
'She's right on the bloody precipice.'

23:27.610 --> 23:29.759
OK. 'Come on, Mark, do it.'

23:29.809 --> 23:32.276
'You're Sugar, you're Trump,
you're Rommel.'

23:32.408 --> 23:34.045
It's been really great seeing you.

23:34.087 --> 23:36.554
And thanks
for coming to the club.

23:36.605 --> 23:40.483
I know it's not your thing. I just
want you to know I appreciate it.

23:40.524 --> 23:42.752
I... Thanks.

23:42.802 --> 23:45.838
Soph... Before you go,

23:45.881 --> 23:49.554
there's something I need to say.

23:49.599 --> 23:50.748
Yeah?

23:50.799 --> 23:53.357
It's just...

23:55.716 --> 24:00.310
You-You've really got
to pull your socks up at work.

24:00.354 --> 24:03.151
- What?
- You've got to stop pulling sickies

24:03.193 --> 24:07.150
and screwing around, Sophie.
Johnson says.

24:07.191 --> 24:10.704
Mark, what the fuck?! My head's
in pieces, I don't need this.

24:10.749 --> 24:12.420
No, Sophie...

24:12.468 --> 24:14.423
If you want to be a major player,

24:14.467 --> 24:17.935
you've got to apply yourself more
and be more punctual.

24:20.824 --> 24:24.656
Hug? 'We'll laugh about this.

24:24.702 --> 24:26.214
'Definitely.

24:26.261 --> 24:30.014
'Unless it kills the relationship
stone dead, which it probably will.'

24:38.016 --> 24:43.451
<i>Paranoia, paranoia,
everybody's coming to get me</i>

24:43.493 --> 24:45.483
<i>Just say you never met me</i>

24:45.532 --> 24:51.764
<i>I'm running underground
with the moles, digging holes</i>
