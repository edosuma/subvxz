WEBVTT

02:52.896 --> 02:54.277
- Ray?

03:02.251 --> 03:03.079
Fuck eh.

03:06.772 --> 03:07.601
Fuck.

03:11.121 --> 03:12.468
Fuck, man, what's the deal?

03:15.022 --> 03:16.196
Are they here?

03:19.440 --> 03:20.717
- I don't know.

03:22.167 --> 03:23.582
- You don't know.

03:25.135 --> 03:26.620
- Can't even tell.

03:39.771 --> 03:41.186
- We're gonna go.

03:45.397 --> 03:47.157
We gotta go now, Ray.

03:48.849 --> 03:51.576
Seriously, sun's going down,
man.

04:41.626 --> 04:43.766
-  Oh, fuck, fuck, fuck!

04:43.800 --> 04:45.250
-  What?

04:45.285 --> 04:46.113
- Road block.

04:49.634 --> 04:51.636
-  They're
blocking the streets now?

04:53.638 --> 04:54.742
- Maybe it's one of ours.

04:54.777 --> 04:56.951
- Army never used abandoned
vehicles as road blocks.

04:56.986 --> 04:58.125
-  It's theirs.

04:58.159 --> 05:00.990
There were no abandoned
vehicles before they got here.

05:01.024 --> 05:02.785
- I knew shouldn't have
come into the city.

05:02.819 --> 05:03.751
I fucking said it, didn't I?

05:03.786 --> 05:05.960
I said we shouldn't
come into the city.

05:05.995 --> 05:07.307
And what the fuck
is your problem?

05:07.341 --> 05:08.653
- Leave him alone, Eric.

05:08.687 --> 05:10.102
- We could all be dead
in the next 15 minutes

05:10.137 --> 05:11.966
because this idiot just
had to come in

05:12.001 --> 05:13.899
and check on people
he knows are dead.

05:13.934 --> 05:16.005
- Eric, leave him alone!

05:16.039 --> 05:17.869
All right, you know what
happened to your family.

05:17.903 --> 05:19.077
He deserves the same.

05:20.147 --> 05:21.148
- I just saw one.

05:21.182 --> 05:21.976
- Where?

05:22.011 --> 05:23.668
- Just passed it, keep driving.

05:24.600 --> 05:25.911
-  How can they
be out yet?

05:25.946 --> 05:26.947
It's not even nightfall.

05:26.981 --> 05:28.880
- Tall buildings create a lot of
shadows.

05:28.914 --> 05:30.019
They can get out earlier.

05:30.053 --> 05:31.054
- What do I do?

05:31.089 --> 05:32.055
- Look for sunny streets.

05:32.090 --> 05:33.229
Here, turn right here.

05:37.095 --> 05:38.165
Keep going.

05:38.199 --> 05:40.374
Don't turn off till you're
sure the way's clear.

05:41.306 --> 05:42.445
- Oh shit, you're right!

05:42.480 --> 05:43.688
I just saw two of them.

05:43.722 --> 05:45.724
- Better get your game face on.

05:45.759 --> 05:47.105
- This is my game face.

05:47.139 --> 05:47.933
- Slow down, slow down!

05:48.865 --> 05:50.557
I just wanna get a look
down the street.

05:50.591 --> 05:51.799
What do you think?

05:51.834 --> 05:52.628
-  It looks clear.

05:52.662 --> 05:53.836
- All right, turn off then.

05:53.870 --> 05:55.216
Be quick here, it's
not the brightest road.

06:05.641 --> 06:06.435
- Which way?

06:06.469 --> 06:07.574
- For God sakes
don't go under it!

06:07.608 --> 06:08.920
- Yeah, don't go under it!

06:09.783 --> 06:11.578
- How we doing back there?

06:11.612 --> 06:12.475
- I don't see anything.

06:12.510 --> 06:14.408
I, I think it's still
too bright out.

06:14.443 --> 06:15.961
-  Bailey, Bailey!

06:15.996 --> 06:16.893
- Oh shit, hold on!

06:18.205 --> 06:19.517
-  Fuck.

06:21.484 --> 06:22.727
- Stay outta my way.

06:22.761 --> 06:23.762
You too, Carlos.

06:30.044 --> 06:30.907
-  Well?

06:31.839 --> 06:34.186
-  Uh, scratch what I
said.

06:34.221 --> 06:36.844
- What?

06:36.879 --> 06:37.742
- They're coming.

06:42.850 --> 06:44.300
- What's the verdict?

06:44.334 --> 06:46.302
- Uh, I see two.

06:47.407 --> 06:48.373
-  Ooh and two.

06:50.789 --> 06:52.826
- The verdict is we're fucked
if we don't get somewhere

06:52.860 --> 06:54.068
far away now!

06:54.931 --> 06:55.725
- All right then.

07:06.426 --> 07:07.254
- Go, go!

07:12.397 --> 07:13.225
- No!

07:16.608 --> 07:17.678
-  Hit the gas!

07:17.713 --> 07:22.718
Jesus!

07:28.827 --> 07:30.380
- Yo.

07:30.415 --> 07:33.763
-  You do
realize you just drove up

07:33.798 --> 07:34.592
an exit ramp!

07:35.558 --> 07:37.180
- You want me to turn around?

07:37.215 --> 07:38.285
- No, no, no, no, no.

07:38.319 --> 07:42.289
Uh, we're exiting the city,
right, right?

07:43.946 --> 07:45.465
Oh Jesus.

08:03.068 --> 08:06.106
-  Highway's not the
safest place to be right now.

08:06.140 --> 08:08.004
- Well, what do you suggest?

08:08.039 --> 08:09.419
- Back road somewhere.

08:09.454 --> 08:11.560
I don't wanna run into another
one of those road blocks,

08:11.594 --> 08:12.457
not at night.

08:18.428 --> 08:20.569
You guys keeping alert back
there?

08:20.603 --> 08:22.156
- Yep, yep, we're alert.

08:23.433 --> 08:26.471
- Alert as in eyes open and
watching.

08:26.506 --> 08:29.612
- Fuck, fucking orders so
specific.

08:32.304 --> 08:34.030
Yeah, all clear, Chief.

08:35.169 --> 08:36.239
Ain't gonna be out here.

08:36.274 --> 08:39.553
They're concentrated in
the cities and the towns.

08:39.587 --> 08:40.520
- That ain't true.

08:41.486 --> 08:43.523
Told you where I came from,
goddamn farm.

08:44.558 --> 08:47.768
Had us caged like fucking
chickens or cows or something.

08:47.803 --> 08:50.081
- Cows aren't kept in cages.

08:50.115 --> 08:51.254
- You know what I mean.

08:52.670 --> 08:53.705
They used real chicken wire.

08:53.740 --> 08:55.258
Kept us penned in horse stalls.

08:55.293 --> 08:56.225
- Horse stalls now.

08:56.259 --> 08:57.467
Get your story straight.

08:58.607 --> 09:00.298
- Keeping us fed and watered.

09:01.644 --> 09:03.197
They were breeding us off, man.

09:04.854 --> 09:06.131
They were just waiting
for all those women

09:06.166 --> 09:09.100
to catch pregnant so they
could the men one by one.

09:10.170 --> 09:13.794
As it was, somebody
disappeared every night.

09:15.934 --> 09:17.142
The fucking lottery.

09:19.420 --> 09:20.525
- How many were there?

09:22.216 --> 09:23.770
- 30, 40.

09:25.668 --> 09:27.601
The only reason I got out is
'cause one of 'em got hungry

09:27.636 --> 09:28.498
in the day.

09:31.018 --> 09:35.126
They kept guards on us inside
the barn even during the day.

09:37.646 --> 09:41.442
Came in my pen and grabbed
the guy next to me.

09:43.824 --> 09:46.793
Left the door open
so I sprinted.

09:48.588 --> 09:51.211
Got out into the daylight
before they could get on me.

09:51.245 --> 09:52.799
- You were lucky.

09:52.833 --> 09:54.007
- I don't know.

09:54.041 --> 09:55.767
Being kept alive to breed.

09:55.802 --> 09:56.975
I can think of worse fates.

09:57.010 --> 09:58.114
- Fuck off, asshole!

10:01.290 --> 10:02.636
I left my brother in there.

10:11.472 --> 10:12.266
-  Shit!

10:13.129 --> 10:14.579
Uh, there's something coming.

10:14.614 --> 10:15.442
- What?

10:15.476 --> 10:16.650
-  I don't know.

10:18.652 --> 10:22.311
- It's a bike or it's a car
with a busted headlight.

10:22.345 --> 10:23.657
- Turn us off next exit.

10:23.692 --> 10:24.934
- I'm looking.

10:24.969 --> 10:27.005
- Oh, we shoulda busted the
taillights out on this thing.

10:27.040 --> 10:28.075
- Good idea, do it.

10:28.110 --> 10:29.111
- Yeah, right.

10:29.145 --> 10:30.560
- No, no, I'm serious, do it.

10:30.595 --> 10:31.389
- You do it!

10:31.423 --> 10:32.666
- I'll hold you.

10:32.701 --> 10:34.288
- Why can't I hold you?

10:34.323 --> 10:35.117
- I'm heavier.

10:35.151 --> 10:36.221
- Well, I'm stronger.

10:36.256 --> 10:37.498
- If either one of you
is gonna do it, do it now

10:37.533 --> 10:40.778
before we reach the
exit and be quick.

10:40.812 --> 10:43.090
I want that back door open for
as short a time as possible.

10:43.125 --> 10:44.851
- Yes, sir!

10:44.885 --> 10:45.679
Do it.

10:45.714 --> 10:46.715
- You do it.

10:47.923 --> 10:49.441
What are you doing?

10:49.476 --> 10:51.720
-  Grab hold of my
belt before I open the door.

10:51.754 --> 10:52.755
- Good idea.

11:07.356 --> 11:12.361
- Hold me and the door.

11:38.836 --> 11:39.837
Shit, she's human.

11:43.323 --> 11:44.945
She's being followed.

11:44.980 --> 11:46.257
-  Tell her to fuck
off.

11:46.291 --> 11:47.223
- What?

11:47.258 --> 11:50.261
- Tell her to ditch the
bike or fuck off.

11:50.295 --> 11:51.572
Fuck, I know they'd break in.

11:51.607 --> 11:53.609
They could follow her scent.

11:53.643 --> 11:54.679
And you get that back door shut.

11:54.714 --> 11:57.130
You're painting a
three-mile path to use, too.

11:57.164 --> 11:58.200
- They can smell you.

11:58.234 --> 11:59.753
Lose the bike, get in the van.

11:59.788 --> 12:01.617
-  You gonna stop first?

12:01.651 --> 12:02.894
- She said stop.

12:02.929 --> 12:03.757
- No.

12:05.517 --> 12:08.382
- Look, just gimme your hands.

12:08.417 --> 12:09.211
You're gonna jump.

12:09.245 --> 12:10.039
You cool with that?

12:10.074 --> 12:11.040
-  Not really.

12:13.042 --> 12:15.458
- He's got me, I'll get you.

12:18.979 --> 12:20.222
-  Okay.

12:23.018 --> 12:23.846
On three.

12:25.848 --> 12:26.711
One.

12:27.885 --> 12:29.541
- Exit coming up.

12:49.078 --> 12:50.631
- This yours?

12:50.666 --> 12:51.494
- Thanks.

12:53.945 --> 12:54.843
- Oh, they're still on us.

12:59.157 --> 12:59.986
I can't see.

13:02.229 --> 13:04.714
- I don't suppose those
are more humans back there?

13:04.749 --> 13:07.131
- No, they've been chasing me
since Barry.

13:07.165 --> 13:08.684
- What were you doing in Barry?

13:08.718 --> 13:10.617
- They were sent there,
they're there in Toronto.

13:10.651 --> 13:12.067
Go in by daylight,
pick a few of them off,

13:12.101 --> 13:13.033
get out again.

13:13.068 --> 13:15.311
- What the fuck were you doing
on a bike?

13:15.346 --> 13:17.072
You know how
those things operate?

13:17.106 --> 13:18.487
You gotta keep a
low scent profile.

13:18.521 --> 13:20.006
stay behind closed doors.

13:20.040 --> 13:21.524
- You been in
the big cities lately?

13:21.559 --> 13:22.629
- We just came from one.

13:22.663 --> 13:24.769
- You run into any of those
barricades?

13:24.804 --> 13:25.943
- Yeah.

13:25.977 --> 13:27.530
- That's why the bike.

13:27.565 --> 13:30.464
- Uh, speed up,
speed up an awful lot.

13:30.499 --> 13:31.500
-  Why?

13:31.534 --> 13:33.226
- 'Cause otherwise we die.

13:40.543 --> 13:41.959
I said faster!

13:41.993 --> 13:43.270
- There is no faster.

13:58.251 --> 14:00.149
- You're not gonna
kill 'em with that.

14:00.184 --> 14:01.633
- I'm not trying to kill 'em.

14:01.668 --> 14:02.980
Just trying to mess
with the driver's head.

14:03.014 --> 14:06.190
- Uh, I'd say you did.

14:43.158 --> 14:44.504
- Shut the door!

15:35.313 --> 15:39.007
- So do you think they'll
keep following us?

15:39.041 --> 15:40.905
- Vehicles out here are slim
pickings.

15:40.940 --> 15:42.217
By the time they get
another up and running

15:42.251 --> 15:43.632
we won't be anywhere around.

15:43.666 --> 15:46.014
- You don't think
maybe they're dead.

15:46.048 --> 15:47.532
I mean, the truck rolled--

15:47.567 --> 15:49.500
- I don't think maybe they're
even hurt.

15:49.534 --> 15:51.191
- Truck didn't explode.

15:51.226 --> 15:52.089
They're not dead.

15:55.851 --> 15:58.371
- Well, you got a name,
gunner girl?

15:59.337 --> 16:00.821
- Vicky.

16:00.856 --> 16:02.271
- Carlos.

16:02.306 --> 16:06.448
- That's Ray, Eric,
Bailey's our chauffeur.

16:06.482 --> 16:08.691
And Private Mitchell's out
getting us gas.

16:09.969 --> 16:11.487
- Sorry about your bike.

16:11.522 --> 16:13.041
We couldn't afford to stop.

16:13.075 --> 16:15.215
- No, thank you for grabbing me
in.

16:15.250 --> 16:18.218
Bike had enough gas in it
to go for awhile probably

16:18.253 --> 16:20.427
but I'm not sure that while
woulda been long enough.

16:20.462 --> 16:23.016
It was half empty when I left
Barry.

16:23.051 --> 16:25.329
- You looked like you had
the situation under control.

16:25.363 --> 16:27.055
- Yeah, with a shotgun sure.

16:27.089 --> 16:28.435
Was kinda fucked on my own.

16:29.402 --> 16:30.920
Great for its intended purpose,

16:30.955 --> 16:33.509
not so hot for blowing away
truck tires on the highway.

16:33.544 --> 16:35.235
- And where was this highway
taking you?

16:35.270 --> 16:36.926
- Oh, my dad has this um...

16:41.621 --> 16:42.863
- Your dad had?

16:48.662 --> 16:49.663
My wife had.

16:51.079 --> 16:51.941
My daughter had.

16:54.013 --> 16:57.016
- That's uh, why we were in
Toronto.

16:58.776 --> 17:01.330
Checked on Bailey's and
my families earlier.

17:01.365 --> 17:02.918
Detroit and London.

17:06.955 --> 17:08.337
Saved the big city for last.

17:09.165 --> 17:11.237
So we were heading up north
anyway and...

17:13.963 --> 17:17.105
We didn't run into many
people, nobody we knew.

17:18.727 --> 17:20.039
Nobody alive that we knew.

17:23.111 --> 17:26.734
- Last I heard they'd been
taken into this shelter

17:26.769 --> 17:28.425
west end of the city.

17:28.461 --> 17:30.221
- They weren't there?

17:32.499 --> 17:34.156
- I really hope not.

17:35.192 --> 17:39.782
-  My dad had a
place up near Kincardine

17:39.817 --> 17:41.646
and I was headed there.

17:41.681 --> 17:42.578
- Kincardine?

17:43.821 --> 17:46.203
Me and Amanda had a cottage and
a boat

17:46.237 --> 17:48.274
up near Grand Bend.

17:48.308 --> 17:49.689
Just bought it last summer,

17:50.966 --> 17:52.519
back when things first
started getting bad.

17:52.554 --> 17:53.762
And before the phone
lines went down

17:53.796 --> 17:55.522
that's where we intended to go.

17:57.559 --> 17:59.388
Then she got taken
into that shelter.

18:01.425 --> 18:05.325
- Uh, so what were doing
messing around in Barry?

18:05.360 --> 18:07.155
- Little revenge never hurt
nobody.

18:08.052 --> 18:09.329
Why north?

18:09.364 --> 18:11.987
- Less populated, colder.

18:12.021 --> 18:13.540
Mitchell thinks that if
we can get up somewhere

18:13.575 --> 18:17.096
in the tundra that they won't
come around.

18:17.130 --> 18:18.683
Nothing to eat up there, right?

18:18.718 --> 18:20.444
- Nothing but you.

18:20.478 --> 18:21.652
- Yeah, but we were thinking

18:21.686 --> 18:24.068
that it might not be
worth their trouble.

18:24.103 --> 18:26.139
You know 'cause
while they're hunting us

18:26.174 --> 18:27.934
they're going hungry.

18:27.968 --> 18:30.523
Somewhere really cold,
no animals.

18:30.557 --> 18:32.318
- And what would you eat?

18:32.352 --> 18:34.251
- I don't know, fish?

18:35.148 --> 18:37.012
- And you think they can't fish.

18:37.046 --> 18:39.532
They can drive a pickup
truck but they can't fish?

18:40.636 --> 18:44.433
They can commandeer television
and radio broadcasts

18:44.468 --> 18:46.125
but they can't fish?

18:46.159 --> 18:47.712
- You caught those, too?

18:47.747 --> 18:48.575
- Yeah, they stopped doing them

18:48.610 --> 18:49.818
'cause the power's down,
I guess.

18:49.852 --> 18:50.681
-  Or 'cause they know

18:50.715 --> 18:52.510
there's no one left to listen.

18:52.545 --> 18:55.858
- All I'm saying is they can't
do everything that we do.

18:55.893 --> 18:58.137
I've never seen one
of them fire a gun.

18:58.171 --> 18:59.414
- Mitchell says he has.

18:59.448 --> 19:02.175
- Yeah , Mitchell
says they were driving tanks

19:02.210 --> 19:03.625
when they rolled into town.

19:03.659 --> 19:05.592
Driving tanks and they
just called off the attack

19:05.627 --> 19:08.112
after half an hour when
it started pouring rain.

19:08.147 --> 19:09.700
That's bullshit.

19:09.734 --> 19:11.322
If they were afraid
of a little rain,

19:11.357 --> 19:12.910
England would still
be on the map.

19:12.944 --> 19:15.602
If they were operating
tanks, why not fire a nuke?

19:15.637 --> 19:17.328
Why is anything left?

19:17.363 --> 19:19.019
- Why would they nuke us?

19:19.054 --> 19:20.262
You don't nuke your food.

19:21.505 --> 19:24.128
- Well, actually in a microwave
you do...

19:26.234 --> 19:27.545
Okay, that is different.

19:28.650 --> 19:31.687
- All I'm saying is I've never
seen one of them fire a gun.

19:31.722 --> 19:33.620
It's just baseball
bats and shit.

19:33.655 --> 19:35.381
- That's not because they can't.

19:35.415 --> 19:37.314
It's because they choose not to.

19:37.348 --> 19:38.625
- Why?

19:38.660 --> 19:42.284
- They don't wanna
waste your blood.

19:57.368 --> 19:58.921
- We know where we're headed?

19:58.956 --> 20:01.752
- Up north just
means you die cold.

20:01.786 --> 20:03.788
There is literally nowhere that
you can go

20:03.823 --> 20:05.756
that they can't follow
if they want to.

20:06.929 --> 20:08.310
We can try my dad's place.

20:08.345 --> 20:11.555
It's remote and it
has other benefits.

20:11.589 --> 20:14.385
- Well, we should get away
from this station right now.

20:14.420 --> 20:16.422
My scent's all over
the place out there.

20:17.354 --> 20:20.115
- So, Kincardine?

20:20.149 --> 20:21.875
-  That's where
her dad's place is.

20:23.636 --> 20:24.982
- Well, it's north anyway.

20:25.016 --> 20:26.984
Gets us where we're going.

20:27.018 --> 20:30.401
I'm not holing up in some
resort town, cottage, or farm.

20:30.436 --> 20:32.058
I'll drop you by
daylight if you want

20:32.092 --> 20:33.577
then we're going on.

20:33.611 --> 20:35.475
- I never said it was a farm.

20:58.395 --> 20:59.258
We're here.

21:33.844 --> 21:35.673
- Thought you said
it wasn't a farm.

21:35.708 --> 21:36.778
- It's not.

21:36.812 --> 21:38.849
- Yeah, what is it
a rural high rise?

21:38.883 --> 21:40.057
- Come on, I'll show you.

21:40.091 --> 21:41.541
- No our van needs gas.

21:41.576 --> 21:43.094
We should get it now
while it's still daylight

21:43.129 --> 21:45.614
and keep going so we can
stop again before nightfall.

21:45.649 --> 21:47.306
I don't wanna pull another
siphon job at night.

21:47.340 --> 21:48.721
- Let me show you first.

21:48.755 --> 21:50.032
- No, now!

21:50.067 --> 21:51.448
You come or you stay but the
rest of us

21:51.482 --> 21:53.001
are going on!
- Whoa, buddy.

21:53.035 --> 21:54.347
I was never in the army
but I'm pretty sure

21:54.382 --> 21:56.591
that one stripe doesn't
mean you're a colonel.

21:56.625 --> 21:57.971
- I'm still the only
one in this group

21:58.006 --> 21:59.559
with any kind of leadership
training.

21:59.594 --> 22:00.457
Now I say we get moving--

22:00.491 --> 22:02.390
- Yeah, yeah,
we know what you say.

22:02.424 --> 22:03.805
You always say it so loud.

22:03.839 --> 22:05.634
All right, we're here, let's
check it out.

22:05.669 --> 22:07.222
Maybe we can stock
up on some food.

22:07.256 --> 22:08.119
Is there food here?

22:08.154 --> 22:08.948
- There's food.

22:08.982 --> 22:09.914
- See, there's food.

22:09.949 --> 22:11.399
Food makes everything better.

22:14.712 --> 22:16.196
- Could use something to eat.

22:17.336 --> 22:19.027
-  Start the
tour in the kitchen.

22:34.698 --> 22:36.285
- So this is it.

22:36.320 --> 22:38.115
We got Chef-Boyardee,

22:38.149 --> 22:40.428
a big screen TV that doesn't
work anymore,

22:40.462 --> 22:43.258
two bedrooms, and a toilet
that doesn't even flush.

22:43.292 --> 22:45.191
This is why we're
wasting our day?

22:45.225 --> 22:47.158
The toilet out back works fine.

22:47.193 --> 22:48.159
- Outhouse?

22:48.194 --> 22:49.195
- Don't knock it.

22:49.229 --> 22:51.439
Plumbing may be down but
septic tank still works.

22:51.473 --> 22:53.406
Should still be stocked
with toilet paper, too.

22:53.441 --> 22:55.960
- We can wipe our asses?

22:55.995 --> 22:56.961
Well, why didn't you say so?

22:56.996 --> 22:58.722
That is worth stopping for.

22:58.756 --> 23:01.034
- You know, you'd be less
cranky if you ate something.

23:01.069 --> 23:02.070
Even Eric stopped whining.

23:02.104 --> 23:03.692
- I'll be less cranky if we got
moving.

23:03.727 --> 23:04.624
Now if our tour is done--

23:04.659 --> 23:06.005
-  It's not done.

23:06.039 --> 23:08.317
- Living room, bedroom,
outhouse.

23:08.352 --> 23:10.699
What more could
there possibly be?

23:10.734 --> 23:12.736
- NBC defense shed out back.

23:15.048 --> 23:16.671
- Bomb shelter?

23:16.705 --> 23:17.810
- Yes, ma'am.

23:17.844 --> 23:19.846
- You think they're
gonna start shelling us?

23:19.881 --> 23:21.089
- No.

23:21.123 --> 23:24.161
But I think it has its own
oxygen filtration system

23:24.195 --> 23:26.197
and lead-lined doors.

23:26.232 --> 23:29.062
I think it's stocked with food
and water.

23:29.097 --> 23:32.272
And I think it'll lock
human body odor in airtight

23:32.307 --> 23:35.793
and give us a place to hole
up in for a good long while.

23:35.828 --> 23:40.073
- I think someone owes
someone an apology.

24:24.704 --> 24:25.602
- Common room.

24:31.228 --> 24:32.056
Bedroom.

24:33.126 --> 24:34.507
- Two beds.

24:34.542 --> 24:35.784
-  We could
bring in more.

24:42.895 --> 24:43.723
- Heart attack?

24:44.586 --> 24:45.829
- Food storage.

24:47.693 --> 24:49.142
And bathroom.

24:49.177 --> 24:51.593
Shares a filtered dump
into the septic tank.

24:51.628 --> 24:54.285
Advantage, keeps radiation
and odor out.

24:54.320 --> 24:55.183
Who knew?

24:55.217 --> 24:58.013
- Not exactly a five-star hotel.

24:58.048 --> 25:00.188
- No, but she's right, it
has everything we need.

25:00.222 --> 25:01.534
Fortified door.

25:01.569 --> 25:03.812
Your dad was paranoid,
thank God.

25:03.847 --> 25:05.055
- Man after your own heart.

25:05.089 --> 25:08.265
- It'd be nice to catch a
nap outside a moving vehicle.

25:08.299 --> 25:09.197
- Bomb shelter.

25:10.232 --> 25:12.476
These lights must have
their own power source.

25:12.511 --> 25:15.168
- There's a generator
partitioned in the storage room.

25:15.203 --> 25:16.860
Should have enough
gas to power the place

25:16.894 --> 25:18.655
for at least three weeks.

25:18.689 --> 25:20.139
- Three weeks ain't a lot
of time to stay covered

25:20.173 --> 25:21.623
in the event of fallout.

25:21.658 --> 25:24.246
- This place was only ever
meant as a temporary solution

25:24.281 --> 25:26.525
in case of nuclear attack.

25:26.559 --> 25:30.770
My dad was an anxious
man but he had faith

25:30.805 --> 25:32.392
in the government.

25:32.427 --> 25:34.602
Figured there'd be
rescue teams and shelters

25:34.636 --> 25:35.568
set up soon enough.

25:36.465 --> 25:37.432
-  What happened
to your dad?

25:37.466 --> 25:40.539
- He died in one of
those rescue shelters

25:40.573 --> 25:41.643
the government set up.

25:46.303 --> 25:47.131
Irony.

25:48.167 --> 25:49.927
- Nothing ironic about it.

25:49.962 --> 25:51.584
Everybody died in those
shelters.

26:02.422 --> 26:04.459
- All right, here's my
problem with this place.

26:04.493 --> 26:06.392
- Mitchell, you always
have a problem

26:06.426 --> 26:08.083
with any plan someone
else comes up with.

26:08.118 --> 26:09.257
Maybe that is the problem.

26:09.291 --> 26:10.810
- Just hear me out.

26:10.845 --> 26:12.363
Fuck.

26:12.398 --> 26:14.987
I know I came down hard on
this place from the start.

26:15.021 --> 26:16.782
I know it's not my plan
to stay here

26:16.816 --> 26:18.680
but my reasoning is valid.

26:18.715 --> 26:21.165
There's no way out of that
shelter except for the way in.

26:21.200 --> 26:23.478
If we're discovered down
there, we're trapped,

26:23.512 --> 26:24.962
fucking cows in a
slaughterhouse.

26:24.997 --> 26:26.688
- No farm metaphors please.

26:26.723 --> 26:28.138
- But, Mitchell,
that's exactly the point.

26:28.172 --> 26:30.830
If it's airtight like she
says, they won't find us.

26:30.865 --> 26:32.142
- I don't wanna go
back in the van.

26:32.176 --> 26:34.006
I'm tired of the van.

26:34.040 --> 26:35.663
- Containing our odors isn't
enough.

26:35.697 --> 26:36.525
- Why not?

26:36.560 --> 26:37.665
That is how they track us.

26:37.699 --> 26:38.735
- Exactly!

26:38.769 --> 26:40.771
That's how they track us.

26:40.806 --> 26:42.117
You know what track means?

26:43.878 --> 26:45.949
It means they follow a scent,

26:45.983 --> 26:47.744
follow a scent that you leave
behind.

26:47.778 --> 26:49.608
That's what makes the van safe.

26:50.747 --> 26:52.024
They follow a scent to
where you got into the van

26:52.058 --> 26:53.750
but the van drove off during
daylight

26:53.784 --> 26:56.028
and provided it doesn't
stop at a gas station

26:56.062 --> 26:58.099
in the middle of the night like
an idiot,

26:58.133 --> 27:00.480
provided windows and doors stay
shut,

27:00.515 --> 27:03.035
then there's no more
scent for them to follow.

27:03.069 --> 27:06.038
If they pick up the
scent here in the house,

27:06.072 --> 27:07.626
in the driveway, in the grass,

27:07.660 --> 27:09.835
right here and they come
looking,

27:09.869 --> 27:10.974
where are we gonna be?

27:12.182 --> 27:13.873
Bomb shelter is stationary,

27:13.908 --> 27:16.462
no driving it away, no escape.

27:16.496 --> 27:17.463
- He's got a point.

27:17.497 --> 27:18.671
- What?

27:18.706 --> 27:19.776
I thought you were onboard.

27:19.810 --> 27:21.640
- I am sick of the van,
too, but he's got a point.

27:21.674 --> 27:22.675
- If he's right, it means

27:22.710 --> 27:25.713
we can't stop for the night
anywhere ever.

27:25.747 --> 27:27.507
Means we spend the rest
of our fucking lives

27:27.542 --> 27:29.095
inside a moving vehicle.

27:29.130 --> 27:31.028
- No, there is someplace we can
go

27:31.063 --> 27:32.443
up north like I said.

27:32.478 --> 27:34.238
- Goddamn military.

27:34.273 --> 27:37.138
Everything is fight or flight,
really?

27:37.172 --> 27:39.312
There are millions of them by
now,

27:39.347 --> 27:42.591
maybe billions all around the
world.

27:42.626 --> 27:43.523
- So why just wait for them,
huh?

27:43.558 --> 27:45.456
Food will run out, water will
run out.

27:45.491 --> 27:46.768
We'll have to move eventually.

27:46.803 --> 27:49.702
- Eventually, yeah, but not
straightaway.

27:49.737 --> 27:51.014
And meanwhile I'm thinking

27:51.048 --> 27:53.602
exactly the same thing you are.

27:53.637 --> 27:56.295
The food will run out for them.

27:59.470 --> 28:00.333
- Jesus.

28:02.681 --> 28:04.752
If there are billions of them
she's right.

28:05.684 --> 28:07.444
What are they gonna eat?

28:07.478 --> 28:08.721
There'll be nothing left to eat.

28:08.756 --> 28:10.343
- Nothing but each other.

28:10.378 --> 28:12.138
They can live short-term off
animal blood.

28:12.173 --> 28:13.139
I've seen it.

28:13.174 --> 28:14.451
But I don't think it's just a
taste thing

28:14.485 --> 28:16.108
that makes them go for humans.

28:16.142 --> 28:19.180
Dogs, other animals, they
can't track them by scent

28:19.214 --> 28:20.560
the way they do us.

28:20.595 --> 28:21.665
My first night in Barry--

28:21.700 --> 28:22.804
- Your first night.

28:22.839 --> 28:24.737
- I went about things a
little wrong at first.

28:24.772 --> 28:26.774
I was kinda pissed.

28:26.808 --> 28:28.776
Anyway, there were hordes of
them

28:28.810 --> 28:31.710
so I buried myself under
this pile of corpses

28:31.744 --> 28:33.884
'cause they seemed to
shy away from the meat

28:33.919 --> 28:35.368
after it spoils.

28:35.403 --> 28:36.749
-  Gee, I wonder why.

28:36.784 --> 28:37.854
- And there was this dog.

28:37.888 --> 28:40.132
I could see him right across the
way.

28:40.166 --> 28:41.098
They had chased him.

28:41.133 --> 28:43.031
I watched him run up and take
cover.

28:43.066 --> 28:46.034
But when they came after,
they couldn't find him.

28:46.069 --> 28:47.484
If that had been a person,

28:47.518 --> 28:49.037
they'd have found him
straightaway

28:49.072 --> 28:51.419
but they can't track the animals

28:51.453 --> 28:54.249
probably 'cause their not
their natural food source.

28:54.284 --> 28:55.492
You see?

28:55.526 --> 28:57.839
They need us but they fucked up.

28:57.874 --> 29:00.635
Because the only way that
they could pull this off

29:00.669 --> 29:02.119
was to build an army large
enough

29:02.154 --> 29:03.776
that they couldn't sustain it.

29:03.811 --> 29:06.261
Even if they pulled like a
factory farm

29:06.296 --> 29:08.160
and ranched us up like cattle--

29:08.194 --> 29:10.024
- Please!

29:10.058 --> 29:12.129
- Nine months to carry a baby to
term

29:12.164 --> 29:14.683
and then how many years until
it's a viable meal source?

29:14.718 --> 29:18.170
I mean, the human population
is way too thin by now.

29:18.204 --> 29:21.138
So if we can hold out, they'll
decline,

29:21.173 --> 29:22.830
they'll turn on each other,

29:22.864 --> 29:24.797
eat each other if that's
possible.

29:24.832 --> 29:26.350
Or else they'll starve.

29:27.179 --> 29:28.801
- Holy shit.

29:28.836 --> 29:30.699
-  Well, lucky I'm an
omnivore.

29:30.734 --> 29:32.701
- So maybe we should hole up
here.

29:32.736 --> 29:34.324
- Even if she's right
they're not gone yet.

29:34.358 --> 29:35.843
All right, they're gonna be out
tonight

29:35.877 --> 29:37.361
and our scent's all over this
place.

29:37.396 --> 29:38.846
There's no way of getting in
that shelter

29:38.880 --> 29:40.571
without leaving that behind.

29:40.606 --> 29:41.434
- Yeah there is.

29:42.711 --> 29:44.921
I think I know why they called
off that attack in the rain.

29:44.955 --> 29:46.267
- Why?

29:46.301 --> 29:49.132
- Why don't they hold a fox
hunt directly after a storm.

29:49.166 --> 29:51.479
- 'Cause it's cruel, hopefully.

29:51.513 --> 29:54.447
- Because a heavy rain washes
away the scent of the quarry.

29:55.483 --> 29:58.382
- So we just wait for a
rain storm and pile in?

29:58.417 --> 30:00.005
- This would be easier in
Vancouver

30:00.039 --> 30:03.077
but hey why don't we just
watch the weather network?

30:04.043 --> 30:05.838
- Okay, now what do we do in the
meantime?

30:14.088 --> 30:16.642
I'd feel a lot more
comfortable if we were moving.

30:16.676 --> 30:17.885
- Ah, there's no point driving

30:17.919 --> 30:20.197
if we have nowhere to drive to.

30:20.232 --> 30:22.786
Just give us a better chance
of running into them, right?

30:22.821 --> 30:25.064
- We have a clear view in every
direction.

30:25.099 --> 30:26.479
They ain't getting near
us without us seeing them

30:26.514 --> 30:27.308
a long way off.

30:28.309 --> 30:29.413
What the fuck?

30:29.448 --> 30:30.345
- You were saying?

30:33.970 --> 30:35.695
- Maybe it's a person.

30:35.730 --> 30:37.111
I mean they don't use guns,
right?

30:38.940 --> 30:40.804
- Well, if it's a person
he's in a bad mood.

30:42.564 --> 30:45.015
Shit, they stole our trick.

30:49.744 --> 30:50.883
-  Just keep going.

30:50.918 --> 30:52.091
- We're stuck.

30:53.575 --> 30:57.821
- We ain't gonna get far on a
flat anyway.

30:57.856 --> 30:59.961
- Oh, we ain't gonna
get far on foot either.

31:10.592 --> 31:11.386
- The windows were up.

31:11.421 --> 31:12.663
They couldn't have smelled us.

31:12.698 --> 31:13.872
- They have eyes, Eric.

31:13.906 --> 31:15.252
- They're supposed to be in the
city.

31:15.287 --> 31:16.391
- Seen!

31:16.426 --> 31:18.359
200 meters, center of axis
approaching us

31:18.393 --> 31:19.256
across the field!

31:21.465 --> 31:22.363
- Kinda wish you brought
something

31:22.397 --> 31:24.296
with a little more range now
don't ya?

31:25.159 --> 31:26.194
I know the feeling.

31:36.929 --> 31:37.723
- Look out!

31:42.314 --> 31:43.522
- Behind us!

32:14.070 --> 32:14.933
- Run!

32:22.802 --> 32:23.596
- One sec!

32:23.631 --> 32:25.150
- No secs, now!

32:25.184 --> 32:27.186
-  Move it, Carlos!

32:28.084 --> 32:29.223
- Ah!

33:04.603 --> 33:09.573
- Come on, Carlos, come on.

33:30.525 --> 33:31.699
- There's no way.

33:56.103 --> 33:57.621
- Get up!

34:10.600 --> 34:11.428
- Eric!

34:17.676 --> 34:19.333
-  Houser.

34:32.793 --> 34:33.726
- Oh, here.

34:34.795 --> 34:36.487
-  Okay.

35:03.170 --> 35:04.895
- Coulda used this three hours
ago.

35:58.777 --> 35:59.605
- Get her onto the beds.

35:59.640 --> 36:00.848
I'll get the power on.

36:07.026 --> 36:07.855
Hold this.

36:09.201 --> 36:11.652
- Why is it partitioned?

36:11.686 --> 36:13.378
- Keeps the noise down.

36:21.040 --> 36:22.145
We got power.

36:33.743 --> 36:34.882
- You got a first aid kit down
here?

36:34.916 --> 36:36.746
Something to disinfect with?

36:45.237 --> 36:46.445
Lose the pants.

36:49.690 --> 36:51.105
- Privacy please.

36:58.285 --> 36:59.217
Ow, fuck me!

37:04.636 --> 37:07.225
- So is she gonna be okay?

37:23.413 --> 37:25.898
- You hoping for some
late night television?

37:25.933 --> 37:26.761
- No.

37:28.763 --> 37:29.868
- What the fuck?

37:30.938 --> 37:32.250
TV's working again.

37:33.975 --> 37:36.046
And you're watching a nature
documentary?

37:40.258 --> 37:41.086
- Cameras.

37:41.949 --> 37:43.640
I didn't see them when we came
in.

37:44.779 --> 37:46.229
-  Doesn't do
no good to take shelter

37:46.264 --> 37:49.197
if you don't know when
the rescue party comes by.

37:49.232 --> 37:50.923
- You expecting a rescue party?

37:50.958 --> 37:53.788
- No, my dad was.

37:53.823 --> 37:56.826
But it doubles nicely as
security.

37:56.860 --> 37:59.277
We can keep an eye out for
any of them approaching.

37:59.311 --> 38:00.139
Check it out.

38:02.176 --> 38:03.729
- Picture in picture.

38:03.764 --> 38:05.352
Pretty sweet.

38:05.386 --> 38:07.008
This thing play DVDs?

38:07.043 --> 38:09.425
- Computer could, I guess,
if we had any down here.

38:09.459 --> 38:12.324
But unless you wanna make
a run into the house.

38:12.359 --> 38:16.224
- You have a DVD system on
your survival hut computer?

38:16.259 --> 38:18.951
- Boredom is a shelteree's worst
enemy.

38:21.091 --> 38:23.715
I just, I always figured
that we'd have time

38:23.749 --> 38:28.271
to grab the entertainment
before the fallout hit.

38:31.032 --> 38:36.037
My dad, he used to say that...

38:53.434 --> 38:54.953
I'm, I'm fine.

38:56.230 --> 38:57.783
I'm fine.

39:00.268 --> 39:02.029
Why aren't you crying?

39:05.446 --> 39:09.139
I, uh, sorry, I didn't
mean that as an insult

39:09.174 --> 39:14.179
but I just, you found out
yesterday

39:15.145 --> 39:17.941
about your wife and your
daughter?

39:21.635 --> 39:24.845
- Went by yesterday to the
shelter.

39:28.089 --> 39:29.021
Everyone was.

39:31.610 --> 39:33.543
There's nothing left,

39:33.578 --> 39:37.340
just dead.

39:37.375 --> 39:38.445
It's really bad death.

39:43.519 --> 39:45.141
I made them all wait in the van.

39:46.970 --> 39:48.109
They weren't gonna let me go in
alone

39:48.144 --> 39:49.525
but I made them.

39:49.559 --> 39:50.733
-  Why?

39:52.942 --> 39:55.910
- Because if I found them...

39:55.945 --> 39:58.050
- You'd have joined them?

40:02.434 --> 40:03.228
- I don't know

40:03.262 --> 40:04.125
if they're alive or dead

40:05.610 --> 40:06.542
or something else.

40:09.130 --> 40:11.581
I don't expect I'll ever see
them again.

40:11.616 --> 40:13.997
- So why aren't you crying?

40:17.622 --> 40:19.865
- Because I could be wrong.

40:20.832 --> 40:25.561
Because if I mourn them
it's like giving them up.

40:28.011 --> 40:28.909
You found yours.

40:28.943 --> 40:29.806
You should mourn.

40:31.774 --> 40:33.948
I'm not ready to give
up on my daughter yet

40:35.122 --> 40:35.950
or my wife.

40:37.400 --> 40:39.333
- Till I put my finger in the
hole.

40:41.680 --> 40:44.580
Oh my God, um,

40:44.614 --> 40:46.685
I didn't mean for that to come
out

40:46.720 --> 40:50.378
as weirdly pornographic as it
did.

40:50.413 --> 40:54.072
It's a biblical reference,
um, Doubting Thomas.

40:55.625 --> 40:56.523
- Flawed metaphor.

40:58.248 --> 41:00.699
Thomas was hoping for evidence
that Christ had come back

41:00.734 --> 41:01.562
from the dead.

41:02.943 --> 41:05.048
My fingers are kinda crossed
in the opposite camp.

41:12.366 --> 41:13.160
- How is she?

41:14.541 --> 41:15.852
- She lost a lot of blood.

41:16.888 --> 41:17.751
I got the wound covered.

41:17.785 --> 41:19.442
I think the blood flow is
staunched.

41:20.339 --> 41:21.133
There's no exit wound.

41:21.168 --> 41:22.859
That bullet's still inside her.

41:22.894 --> 41:23.964
- Can you get it out?

41:24.827 --> 41:25.966
- I'm not a medic.

41:26.000 --> 41:27.864
I'm a rifleman, trained
to put bullets into people

41:27.899 --> 41:29.521
not get them out.

41:29.556 --> 41:31.385
I covered her up and that pretty
much exhausts my education

41:31.419 --> 41:32.490
of medical matters.

41:32.524 --> 41:34.215
- What's the consequence of
leaving it in?

41:34.250 --> 41:35.700
- Covered her up.

41:35.734 --> 41:37.529
- We'll have to monitor it.

41:37.564 --> 41:39.048
There's a chance it won't be a
problem.

41:39.082 --> 41:41.050
The body might accept the
bullet.

41:41.084 --> 41:42.430
- Or?

41:42.465 --> 41:43.777
- It could reject it.

41:44.847 --> 41:46.365
And that wound was exposed to
swamp water

41:46.400 --> 41:49.127
so infection is a possibility I
suppose.

41:50.231 --> 41:55.236
Like could go septic,
gangrene, tetanus, death.

41:56.099 --> 41:57.687
- You a doctor?

41:57.722 --> 41:59.206
-  No.

41:59.240 --> 42:00.863
No, I was in IT.

42:00.897 --> 42:01.967
My wife was a nurse.

42:03.451 --> 42:05.212
You cleaned it?

42:05.246 --> 42:06.524
- Best I could.

42:08.111 --> 42:09.561
- That's all we can do I guess.

42:09.596 --> 42:12.046
'Less you want some
painkillers or something.

42:12.081 --> 42:13.945
- She took a couple already.

42:13.979 --> 42:15.360
She didn't like when I was
poking around the wound

42:15.394 --> 42:18.397
but the rest of the time
she seemed to be okay.

42:18.432 --> 42:20.158
I'm gonna go back in, sit with
her.

42:21.366 --> 42:22.919
What's this?

42:22.954 --> 42:24.576
- Farm and Garden's television.

42:24.611 --> 42:26.440
- It's our security.

42:26.474 --> 42:28.235
- Somebody gonna sit up and
monitor?

42:28.269 --> 42:29.685
- I will for now.

42:29.719 --> 42:31.790
Not quite unwound yet anyway.

42:31.825 --> 42:33.551
- Sleeping arrangements?

42:33.585 --> 42:34.862
- Take the other cot in there
with her

42:34.897 --> 42:36.554
if you're gonna keep an eye on
her.

42:36.588 --> 42:38.486
If we can wake Bubba
Snoozebutton over here

42:38.521 --> 42:42.663
we can lay out some more
clothing for temporary bedding.

42:42.698 --> 42:43.975
If it's still raining come
daylight

42:44.009 --> 42:46.356
we'll slip into the house,
grab another mattress or two.

42:46.391 --> 42:47.910
- We should probably all
get into dry clothing

42:47.944 --> 42:49.187
before turning in anyway.

42:49.221 --> 42:50.222
- Good call.

42:50.257 --> 42:51.258
I'm cold.

42:51.292 --> 42:52.155
-  You just noticing?

42:52.190 --> 42:53.329
- Yeah.

42:53.363 --> 42:54.744
- Gotta love adrenaline.

43:14.005 --> 43:17.249
-  You hold that post all
night?

43:20.770 --> 43:22.082
Shoulda woke me.

43:22.116 --> 43:23.221
I'd have taken a turn.

43:24.740 --> 43:26.327
- How's she doing this morning?

43:28.433 --> 43:31.298
- Bit of a fever but she's
asleep for the moment.

43:32.817 --> 43:34.542
I take it we had no
visitors during the night.

43:34.577 --> 43:35.543
- Nope.

43:35.578 --> 43:37.338
Ray's rain theory seems to be
holding up.

43:39.030 --> 43:40.721
- What'd you say about me?

43:40.756 --> 43:43.690
- Said you snore too loud,
kept me up all night.

43:44.622 --> 43:46.624
- We got breakfast-appropriate
foods down here?

43:46.658 --> 43:50.455
- We've got can
opener-appropriate
foods, uni-meal.

43:50.489 --> 43:52.526
Pancakes weren't exactly
an Armageddon priority

43:52.560 --> 43:53.458
when we stocked up.

43:53.492 --> 43:55.494
- And that can opener would be--

43:55.529 --> 43:56.772
- Couple of 'em in there.

43:57.704 --> 43:59.913
- You guys talking about
pancakes?

44:37.536 --> 44:40.436
- You got weird taste
in movies for a chick.

44:40.470 --> 44:42.541
- Fuck off, I like the social
commentary.

44:46.304 --> 44:48.616
- Oh we are so watching this!

44:48.651 --> 44:50.480
- That's just socially awkward!

44:51.999 --> 44:53.587
-  I wanna thank
you all for coming.

44:53.621 --> 44:55.658
We did not expect this many
people here

44:55.693 --> 44:56.901
but we're really excited to show
you

44:56.935 --> 44:58.903
what we're working on.

45:08.913 --> 45:09.707
- Ray.

45:10.984 --> 45:11.881
Come look at this.

45:13.918 --> 45:15.333
- Want I should pause it?

45:15.367 --> 45:17.715
- Nope, I'm down here three
weeks.

45:17.749 --> 45:19.440
We'll be watching it again
anyway.

45:24.135 --> 45:24.963
- Nice plie.

45:30.072 --> 45:30.969
- Hey.

45:31.004 --> 45:32.488
- Hey.

45:32.522 --> 45:34.007
- You wanna see something gross?

45:34.041 --> 45:34.973
-  Not really.

45:43.464 --> 45:45.328
- Nice bedside manner.

45:46.260 --> 45:47.537
I dare you to look at it.

45:50.782 --> 45:52.232
- Well, fuck, Bailey.

45:54.061 --> 45:55.822
You got yourself one mean
infection there.

45:55.856 --> 45:58.514
- It's 'cause we went
through that swamp, isn't it?

45:58.548 --> 45:59.618
- Probably.

45:59.653 --> 46:00.999
Well, that and the fact
that you have a bullet

46:01.034 --> 46:02.138
lodged in your leg.

46:03.105 --> 46:04.209
Does it hurt?

46:04.244 --> 46:07.626
- It's hot all the time and yeah
it hurts

46:07.661 --> 46:08.731
if anyone touches it.

46:10.319 --> 46:11.527
- You want me to drag you back
out there

46:11.561 --> 46:13.287
so you can watch the rest of the
show?

46:13.322 --> 46:14.737
-  What are you
watching?

46:14.772 --> 46:16.808
- Bunch of 10-year-olds dancing
badly.

46:16.843 --> 46:18.706
-  I'll pass.

46:18.741 --> 46:20.847
Can you just get me a
book or something to read?

46:20.881 --> 46:22.780
- I'll see what Vick's got.

46:22.814 --> 46:25.023
-  Thanks.

46:30.753 --> 46:31.961
-  So what's the deal?

46:31.996 --> 46:35.102
-  It's an infection like
I said.

46:36.207 --> 46:38.381
That's worrisome, the fever.

46:38.416 --> 46:40.694
Did you see those streak lines?

46:40.728 --> 46:41.522
It's spreading.

46:41.557 --> 46:42.800
- So what do we do?

46:43.939 --> 46:47.045
- Well, if there was still
such thing as doctors,

46:48.081 --> 46:49.530
better yet no such thing as
vampires,

46:49.565 --> 46:51.222
we'd get her to a hospital.

46:51.256 --> 46:53.051
She needs antibiotics for one
thing.

46:54.881 --> 46:56.503
- Maybe Vicky has some in
the house or something.

46:56.537 --> 46:59.817
- Yeah, ask, but those
things are time-sensitive.

46:59.851 --> 47:02.716
You can't just keep them
around indefinitely.

47:02.750 --> 47:04.028
And judging by how bad the
infection is

47:04.062 --> 47:08.204
and how quickly it's spread, I
think she's gonna need a lot.

47:08.239 --> 47:11.207
Something like, you know,
what the fuck's the term?

47:11.242 --> 47:13.658
Uh, broad-spectrum.

47:14.521 --> 47:16.454
'Cause we don't know
what we're dealing with.

47:16.488 --> 47:17.524
- Broad-spectrum.

47:17.558 --> 47:19.560
You talk the talk, you ain't a
doctor?

47:19.595 --> 47:21.631
- You pick stuff up.

47:21.666 --> 47:23.702
I used to like listening to my
wife talk.

47:24.980 --> 47:27.637
Mitchell, the bullet has to come
out.

47:28.673 --> 47:30.192
- How?

47:30.226 --> 47:33.643
- You go in through the hole,
you pull it out, I guess.

47:33.678 --> 47:34.472
- Pull it out with what?

47:34.506 --> 47:35.818
- Mitchell, I don't know.

47:35.853 --> 47:37.613
- What's the problem?

47:37.647 --> 47:39.684
- Bailey's leg's all fucked up.

47:39.718 --> 47:41.893
- All right, what
happens if we do nothing?

47:41.928 --> 47:44.068
- The infection keeps spreading.

47:44.102 --> 47:45.552
Eventually she'll die.

47:46.415 --> 47:48.313
- Okay, we gotta get on this
now.

47:48.348 --> 47:50.005
- Well, how?

47:50.039 --> 47:51.592
We have no vehicle.

47:51.627 --> 47:52.904
Do we?

47:52.939 --> 47:54.388
- All right, then we get
out and we look around.

47:54.423 --> 47:55.286
There were neighbors, all right.

47:55.320 --> 47:56.425
Somebody might've left something
behind.

47:56.459 --> 47:58.116
We get out now while it's
daylight.

47:58.151 --> 48:00.256
- Mitchell, it's not even
raining.

48:00.291 --> 48:01.464
If we're right about that whole
deal,

48:01.499 --> 48:03.501
we get out, we find a car, we
get to town,

48:03.535 --> 48:05.089
get the stuff we need, get back.

48:05.123 --> 48:06.884
If it hasn't started raining by
nightfall

48:06.918 --> 48:09.817
we have left a clear scent bomb
all around the neighborhood.

48:09.852 --> 48:11.681
I'm sure there aren't that
many humans left around here.

48:11.716 --> 48:14.063
We leave a scent,
we leave the only scent.

48:14.098 --> 48:16.997
- We lost Eric last night,
I'm not losing Bailey.

48:17.032 --> 48:19.068
- It doesn't do her any good
to get the leg cleaned up

48:19.103 --> 48:21.001
if she's eaten later on
tonight because of it.

48:24.349 --> 48:25.212
- Are you arguing about me?

48:25.247 --> 48:26.420
- Get back in bed, Bailey.

48:26.455 --> 48:27.249
- What's the problem?

48:27.283 --> 48:28.422
-  You need medicine.

48:28.457 --> 48:30.252
The boys were just discussing
the most efficient way

48:30.286 --> 48:31.080
of getting it.

48:31.115 --> 48:32.012
- Oh there is no discussion.

48:32.047 --> 48:33.496
We go now while it's daylight.

48:33.531 --> 48:34.325
- Is it raining?

48:34.359 --> 48:35.153
- But Bailey, it's--

48:35.188 --> 48:36.430
- Then you wait.

48:38.881 --> 48:39.675
- Bailey, we need--

48:39.709 --> 48:41.366
- Then you wait, Mitchell.

48:41.401 --> 48:44.128
I don't wanna put every life
here at risk.

48:44.162 --> 48:46.924
-  Get in position,
Myrna.

48:49.857 --> 48:51.169
- You joining us after all?

48:53.344 --> 48:54.621
- Can you start it over?

48:58.280 --> 48:59.108
- Sure.

49:04.631 --> 49:06.253
- Right there, rain.

49:06.288 --> 49:08.566
All right, let's do this
now while it's daylight.

49:13.847 --> 49:17.713
- This is the exact opposite
of what my mother taught me.

49:17.747 --> 49:20.819
Heading outside just as it
starts to rain

49:20.854 --> 49:22.545
and just as it starts to get
dark.

49:24.202 --> 49:25.997
How much daylight you figure we
got?

49:26.032 --> 49:27.033
- Less than an hour.

49:27.999 --> 49:29.828
Okay, we split into teams of
two.

49:29.863 --> 49:31.416
Carlos, you're with me.

49:31.451 --> 49:34.040
We hit every house we find,
check medicine cabinets, too.

49:34.074 --> 49:35.282
Get anything that might be of
use.

49:35.317 --> 49:37.215
Whatever we do, we're
back here before dark.

49:37.250 --> 49:38.078
Clear?

49:40.356 --> 49:41.185
Let's go.

51:41.926 --> 51:44.618
- We are the unluckiest
two fuckers in the country.

51:44.653 --> 51:46.137
- Considering we're one
of the last few breathing

51:46.172 --> 51:48.691
in this country, I'd say that's
a bit of an overstatement.

51:48.726 --> 51:49.692
- An overstatement?

51:50.659 --> 51:51.487
- Yeah.

52:12.267 --> 52:15.994
That's the unluckiest
fucker in the country.

52:26.384 --> 52:27.385
No luck?

52:27.420 --> 52:29.111
- I think everybody
heeded the warnings,

52:29.146 --> 52:30.871
got to the shelters in the
cities.

52:30.906 --> 52:32.701
- Well, the fella
who last owned this

52:32.735 --> 52:34.599
wasn't exactly the
shelter-seeking type.

52:34.634 --> 52:36.532
Well, not to seek shelter.

52:36.567 --> 52:38.879
I was hoping we'd
find a car or something

52:38.914 --> 52:40.329
so the four of us
could go into town.

52:40.364 --> 52:43.090
- Somebody's gotta stay
behind with Bailey anyway.

52:43.125 --> 52:44.713
It'll have to be you and Carlos.

52:44.747 --> 52:46.439
Vicky's the only one who
knows where the pharmacy is

52:46.473 --> 52:49.338
and it looks like I'm
the designated doctor.

52:49.373 --> 52:50.408
- Well listen,
if it's stopped raining

52:50.443 --> 52:51.444
by the time you get back--

52:51.478 --> 52:52.790
- Yeah, yeah, we know.

52:52.824 --> 52:54.516
- Back off, get your own
shelter.

53:17.021 --> 53:18.264
-  Looks like they're open.

53:18.298 --> 53:19.437
- What luck.

53:19.472 --> 53:20.438
This gonna take long?

53:20.473 --> 53:21.819
- No.

53:21.853 --> 53:23.786
Some antibiotics maybe some
gauze.

53:23.821 --> 53:25.995
We need nothing else, right?

53:26.030 --> 53:27.204
- Can get me a Snickers.

53:39.630 --> 53:41.148
- Holler if you need anything.

53:41.183 --> 53:42.080
- Bank on it.

55:12.101 --> 55:12.930
Hurry.

55:37.851 --> 55:38.680
Oh fuck!

55:39.819 --> 55:40.682
No!

56:29.006 --> 56:29.800
Son of a bitch!

56:29.834 --> 56:30.801
Get to the bike now!

57:03.247 --> 57:04.386
Where's my chocolate?

57:11.151 --> 57:11.980
- They're back!

57:17.399 --> 57:18.193
-  How did it go?

57:18.227 --> 57:19.021
-  Got the drugs.

57:19.056 --> 57:19.850
- Any problems.

57:19.884 --> 57:21.438
- Shit load of vampires in town.

57:21.472 --> 57:23.301
We got out, obviously.

57:23.336 --> 57:24.130
- Not followed?

57:24.164 --> 57:24.958
- No way.

57:24.993 --> 57:25.994
Straight roads most of the way

57:26.028 --> 57:28.134
and we don't leave
tracks on wet pavement.

57:30.101 --> 57:32.172
Be a dear, get us some towels.

57:32.207 --> 57:33.450
- Uh, right.

57:34.761 --> 57:35.590
- Okay.

57:39.179 --> 57:43.045
- So Ray has some antibiotics
he's gonna give you.

57:44.046 --> 57:46.290
- You don't look so hot.

57:46.324 --> 57:49.155
- Funny, I feel very hot.

57:49.189 --> 57:51.364
- Well, that's because
you have a fever.

57:51.398 --> 57:53.677
- It's 'cause I'm all pussey
and infected and gross, right?

57:53.711 --> 57:56.507
- And that's because
you're shot.

57:56.542 --> 57:58.578
There's a hole in your
leg, dear Liza, dear Liza.

57:58.613 --> 58:00.269
- So should we get these
antibiotics started.

58:00.304 --> 58:01.098
- I can't yet.

58:01.132 --> 58:02.548
I gotta get the
bullet out first.

58:02.582 --> 58:04.101
- Why first?

58:04.135 --> 58:07.242
- Because I didn't have time
to find any kind of anesthetics

58:07.276 --> 58:10.901
so we're gonna have to pull
an Old West maneuver here.

58:10.935 --> 58:12.350
- I get to get really drunk?

58:13.282 --> 58:15.112
- My dear, you get to get
shit-faced.

58:16.216 --> 58:18.667
Alcohol and antibiotics
don't mix.

58:18.702 --> 58:22.015
- And then who's digging
this bullet outta me?

58:23.120 --> 58:25.191
- You're the most qualified.

58:25.225 --> 58:26.054
- Lucky me.

58:27.020 --> 58:29.678
- Getting me drunk
just to get inside me.

58:29.713 --> 58:32.370
It's like high school
all over again.

59:00.640 --> 59:04.126
- She is gonna have
one hell of a headache.

59:04.161 --> 59:06.473
- Well, sure it'll hurt

59:06.508 --> 59:08.372
a hell of a lot less than this
would've.

59:16.725 --> 59:17.795
- I can't watch this.

59:17.830 --> 59:19.314
- Go watch the monitors then.

59:24.906 --> 59:25.976
- Oh, it's fucking deep.

59:26.010 --> 59:27.184
- Can you get it out?

59:27.218 --> 59:29.842
- Well, I'm certainly not
doing this for my enjoyment.

59:29.876 --> 59:30.705
Sorry.

59:32.292 --> 59:33.811
All right, I know where it is.

59:51.104 --> 59:51.933
I got it.

59:59.630 --> 01:00:01.390
- It's so small.

01:00:02.875 --> 01:00:04.773
- I'm sure Bailey would say
otherwise.

01:00:17.510 --> 01:00:18.580
-  Beep, beep.

01:00:21.790 --> 01:00:23.309
- Thank you.

01:00:23.343 --> 01:00:24.172
- Yeah.

01:00:26.208 --> 01:00:29.073
- Uh, she gonna be okay?

01:00:30.661 --> 01:00:31.455
- Bullet's out.

01:00:34.423 --> 01:00:37.254
I doused some gauze in
some hydrogen peroxide

01:00:37.288 --> 01:00:40.395
and packed the wound,
but until she wakes up

01:00:40.429 --> 01:00:42.224
and gets some medicine in her,

01:00:42.259 --> 01:00:43.950
she ain't gonna get on the mend.

01:00:48.783 --> 01:00:49.991
- Get you anything, Doc?

01:00:51.130 --> 01:00:53.546
- I could do with the
rest of that whiskey,

01:00:53.580 --> 01:00:55.962
maybe some Coke.

01:00:55.997 --> 01:00:57.412
- Whiskey I can get you.

01:00:57.446 --> 01:00:59.034
The Coke, I should warn you

01:00:59.069 --> 01:01:00.449
that I've been to the storage
room

01:01:00.484 --> 01:01:04.557
and it might be transparent
bubbles and water flavored.

01:01:04.591 --> 01:01:06.248
-  Whiskey
and water will be fine.

01:01:28.477 --> 01:01:31.998
- I can stay up awhile and
keep an eye on the planet.

01:01:32.033 --> 01:01:33.034
- Thank you.

01:01:59.129 --> 01:02:00.061
Good night.

01:02:33.819 --> 01:02:34.647
Carlos?

01:02:36.753 --> 01:02:37.615
Carlos!

01:02:38.478 --> 01:02:39.479
- Hmm, what?

01:02:40.618 --> 01:02:43.035
- What time is it?

01:02:43.069 --> 01:02:45.485
- Shit, how did it happen?

01:02:45.520 --> 01:02:46.624
- Is it still night?

01:02:46.659 --> 01:02:47.591
- What, uh...

01:02:48.834 --> 01:02:49.835
- The camera feed's down.

01:02:49.869 --> 01:02:50.939
-  Why?

01:02:50.974 --> 01:02:51.802
- We don't know.

01:02:51.837 --> 01:02:52.665
Get off.

01:02:54.115 --> 01:02:55.219
Shit!

01:02:55.254 --> 01:02:57.221
- Is it the cameras outside
or just the connection?

01:02:57.256 --> 01:02:58.050
- I don't know.

01:02:58.084 --> 01:02:58.913
- What's going on?

01:02:59.845 --> 01:03:00.638
Oh shit.

01:03:00.673 --> 01:03:01.536
How many hours till sunup?

01:03:01.570 --> 01:03:03.952
- I don't know, hour, hour and a
half.

01:03:03.987 --> 01:03:05.678
Oh, I can't get the picture
back.

01:03:05.712 --> 01:03:07.128
- We don't know that it's them.

01:03:07.162 --> 01:03:08.025
I mean--

01:03:08.060 --> 01:03:08.957
- There's only one way in this
place.

01:03:08.992 --> 01:03:10.303
If it is and they want in,

01:03:10.338 --> 01:03:12.581
they're gonna have to do
it before the sun comes up.

01:03:12.616 --> 01:03:15.826
- So well, we're just gonna wait
'em out?

01:03:15.861 --> 01:03:17.241
- Oh, I'm sorry, you got some
place to be?

01:03:17.276 --> 01:03:18.277
- Besides dreamland?

01:03:18.311 --> 01:03:19.312
- I'm sorry.

01:03:27.769 --> 01:03:28.701
- It's been daylight for hours
now.

01:03:28.735 --> 01:03:30.392
- I don't hear rain.

01:03:30.427 --> 01:03:32.187
We open that door and it's not
raining

01:03:32.222 --> 01:03:33.706
then we have fucked ourselves.

01:03:33.740 --> 01:03:35.570
- We need to know
what's going on.

01:03:35.604 --> 01:03:36.985
Ordinarily I'd be totally
onboard

01:03:37.020 --> 01:03:38.815
with the batten down
the hatches philosophy

01:03:38.849 --> 01:03:39.677
but we're blind.

01:04:22.237 --> 01:04:23.756
-  Maybe it
was the wind.

01:04:23.790 --> 01:04:26.069
- Wind didn't tear down
all four cameras.

01:04:26.103 --> 01:04:27.139
- Or steal the bike.

01:04:32.661 --> 01:04:35.975
- It looks just like
mindless vandalism.

01:04:37.321 --> 01:04:39.220
- Maybe they didn't
know we were here.

01:04:40.083 --> 01:04:42.602
I mean, they didn't even
try to get in, right?

01:04:42.637 --> 01:04:44.190
- They couldn't have
if they tried

01:04:45.053 --> 01:04:45.985
not without explosives.

01:04:46.020 --> 01:04:47.055
The door's built thick.

01:04:47.090 --> 01:04:48.263
- Well, maybe they knew that.

01:04:48.298 --> 01:04:50.921
Maybe they knew it wasn't
worth the while to even try.

01:04:50.956 --> 01:04:52.336
- No way.

01:04:52.371 --> 01:04:55.029
A, it's just not their style
to leave without a fight

01:04:55.063 --> 01:04:57.445
and B, there's no scent.

01:04:57.479 --> 01:04:58.549
We weren't followed.

01:04:58.584 --> 01:05:00.724
There's no way they could've
known we were there.

01:05:00.758 --> 01:05:03.485
They must've just
happened by and decided

01:05:03.520 --> 01:05:05.246
to trash the place.

01:05:06.178 --> 01:05:07.075
-  No.

01:05:09.008 --> 01:05:10.251
- No, what?

01:05:10.285 --> 01:05:11.908
- No, they didn't
just happen by.

01:05:38.175 --> 01:05:39.107
-  I guess he
wasn't as dead

01:05:39.142 --> 01:05:40.833
as I gave him credit for.

01:05:40.867 --> 01:05:42.800
-  Or half the
poet he claimed.

01:05:50.636 --> 01:05:52.603
- Why you suppose
they didn't attack?

01:05:52.638 --> 01:05:54.122
- Could be they
just got here too late,

01:05:54.157 --> 01:05:55.986
didn't think they had
time to finish the job.

01:05:56.021 --> 01:05:57.367
- That doesn't jibe.

01:05:57.401 --> 01:05:58.299
If it was just a timing issue,

01:05:58.333 --> 01:05:59.334
they wouldn't have
broken the cameras.

01:05:59.369 --> 01:06:00.646
Certainly wouldn't
have left a message

01:06:00.680 --> 01:06:03.200
to let us know they
know we're here.

01:06:03.235 --> 01:06:04.339
No, they'd have busted the
cameras

01:06:04.374 --> 01:06:05.996
right before they attacked,
kept us in the dark

01:06:06.031 --> 01:06:07.101
about the whole thing.

01:06:08.895 --> 01:06:10.932
- Maybe they were
trying to scare us.

01:06:10.967 --> 01:06:12.520
- Mission accomplished.

01:06:12.554 --> 01:06:15.005
- No, scare us into leaving

01:06:15.040 --> 01:06:16.593
'cause they can't get in, right?

01:06:23.393 --> 01:06:25.395
- Means they'll be back tonight.

01:06:25.429 --> 01:06:26.948
- Question is, will we?

01:06:27.949 --> 01:06:29.847
- I don't see as we
have much choice.

01:06:29.882 --> 01:06:32.298
We got no transportation
and Bailey can't walk.

01:06:32.333 --> 01:06:34.128
We searched for over an
hour and couldn't find

01:06:34.162 --> 01:06:35.301
no other cars around here.

01:06:35.336 --> 01:06:37.062
- But we can't stay here.

01:06:37.096 --> 01:06:37.924
- That door's built thick

01:06:37.959 --> 01:06:38.995
but if they want in bad enough

01:06:39.029 --> 01:06:40.272
they can get in.

01:06:40.306 --> 01:06:41.928
All they gotta do is
truck back to Toronto

01:06:41.963 --> 01:06:44.103
or one of the other places
the military put up a stand,

01:06:44.138 --> 01:06:45.622
pick up something
you boys left behind.

01:06:45.656 --> 01:06:47.313
- Yeah how many of them are
gonna know how to operate

01:06:47.348 --> 01:06:48.452
a Carl Gustaf?

01:06:48.487 --> 01:06:50.730
- Some of them are you,
soldiers,

01:06:50.765 --> 01:06:52.111
just a reminder.

01:06:52.146 --> 01:06:53.837
- I mean,
they drive tanks, right?

01:06:59.360 --> 01:07:01.431
- You know, I don't get it.

01:07:01.465 --> 01:07:04.261
This whole place was your idea
and I finally concede to you

01:07:04.296 --> 01:07:06.815
that it was the right one
and now you wanna split.

01:07:06.850 --> 01:07:08.921
- My idea was to
hole up and hide,

01:07:08.955 --> 01:07:11.441
not hole up and wait like a
blood buffet.

01:07:11.475 --> 01:07:12.787
We have to get out of here!

01:07:12.821 --> 01:07:13.650
- How?

01:07:18.310 --> 01:07:20.001
Hey look, I'm sorry.

01:07:20.036 --> 01:07:23.004
Okay, I'm not trying to get
back in the dictator mode.

01:07:23.039 --> 01:07:24.523
Bottom line is I'm
not leaving her behind

01:07:24.557 --> 01:07:25.834
and we got no way outta here.

01:07:26.766 --> 01:07:28.113
- Then we have to find one.

01:07:32.289 --> 01:07:35.637
Look, they know
where we are, right?

01:07:35.672 --> 01:07:38.571
No point in worrying about
scent trails anymore.

01:07:38.606 --> 01:07:39.572
We're fine by daylight.

01:07:39.607 --> 01:07:42.092
That gives us like six
hours to find a way.

01:07:42.127 --> 01:07:44.405
We split up, we look for a
vehicle.

01:07:44.439 --> 01:07:45.785
If we ain't found one by
nightfall,

01:07:45.820 --> 01:07:48.374
we DD back here, get set for a
siege.

01:07:48.409 --> 01:07:49.686
In the meantime someone should
stay behind

01:07:49.720 --> 01:07:51.826
and shore up the defenses.

01:07:51.860 --> 01:07:52.758
Sound like a plan?

01:08:21.166 --> 01:08:24.029
- Hey, wake up, Bailey.

01:08:24.064 --> 01:08:27.136
-  Oh my God, I feel
sick.

01:08:27.171 --> 01:08:29.553
- Well, you got hungover
now as well as infected.

01:08:30.416 --> 01:08:32.867
Hey, listen, some of us
are gonna go get a car

01:08:32.901 --> 01:08:34.938
or something so we can get outta
here.

01:08:34.971 --> 01:08:36.319
- Why would we wanna leave?

01:08:38.148 --> 01:08:40.461
- The location may have been
compromised.

01:08:40.495 --> 01:08:42.118
Hey, hey, it's okay.

01:08:42.152 --> 01:08:43.221
All right, it's broad daylight.

01:08:43.256 --> 01:08:44.706
Nothing's gonna hurt you.

01:08:44.741 --> 01:08:46.466
We'll find something before
nightfall.

01:08:48.883 --> 01:08:49.711
Here.

01:08:52.127 --> 01:08:53.094
- Isn't that a lot?

01:08:54.406 --> 01:08:55.993
- Oh it's got it covered.

01:08:56.028 --> 01:08:58.685
Ray thinks you need a big
dose just to jumpstart things.

01:08:59.720 --> 01:09:01.274
Come on, big bites for Daddy.

01:09:09.006 --> 01:09:10.974
Now, Carlos is gonna stay
here and he'll be in and out

01:09:11.008 --> 01:09:13.563
of the house grabbing something
to build a barricade with--

01:09:13.596 --> 01:09:15.254
- I thought we were leaving.

01:09:15.288 --> 01:09:16.841
- It's just in case.

01:09:16.876 --> 01:09:18.118
It's all just in case.

01:09:20.432 --> 01:09:23.124
So he'll be here if you
need anything, okay?

01:09:23.158 --> 01:09:25.299
He'll be making sure you
take your medicine, too,

01:09:25.332 --> 01:09:26.852
so don't give him a hard time.

01:09:28.785 --> 01:09:29.613
- Mitchell.

01:09:32.926 --> 01:09:34.170
I haven't thanked you yet

01:09:35.100 --> 01:09:38.139
for taking care of me,
being so good.

01:09:42.729 --> 01:09:44.697
- It's okay, baby.

01:09:44.732 --> 01:09:45.698
Next time I get shot in the leg,

01:09:45.733 --> 01:09:47.666
I'm gonna make you do all the
housework.

01:10:08.859 --> 01:10:09.895
- Ah, it's broad daylight.

01:10:09.929 --> 01:10:11.207
It'll just slow me down.

01:10:12.173 --> 01:10:15.072
If I'm not back by nightfall,
you'll need it more than me.

01:10:23.184 --> 01:10:25.842
- Three hours, then we
start sealing the door.

01:10:25.876 --> 01:10:27.775
Make sure you're on the right
side of it.

01:10:30.226 --> 01:10:33.125
Don't spend time searching
places we already searched.

01:10:39.476 --> 01:10:40.305
- You're good?

01:10:41.340 --> 01:10:42.686
- Gettin' there.

01:10:42.721 --> 01:10:43.549
- Okay.

01:11:55.414 --> 01:11:56.726
I'm gonna need tools.

01:12:34.073 --> 01:12:35.247
Mmm hmm.

01:12:35.281 --> 01:12:36.835
Ha ha ha, a hammer.

01:12:37.767 --> 01:12:40.252
Now if only I had some nails.

01:12:58.201 --> 01:12:59.029
Oh.

01:13:03.965 --> 01:13:07.244
And that is why they call me
Casino Carlos

01:13:07.279 --> 01:13:09.385
because I am just so damn

01:13:16.426 --> 01:13:17.531
lucky.

01:16:54.299 --> 01:16:55.127
- Checked it.

01:16:57.440 --> 01:16:58.372
Checked it.

01:17:01.237 --> 01:17:02.065
Checked it.

01:17:06.932 --> 01:17:07.761
I left you open.

01:17:24.605 --> 01:17:25.744
What the fuck?

01:17:26.642 --> 01:17:28.057
Holy fuck!

01:17:47.145 --> 01:17:48.387
Son of a bitch.

01:18:35.780 --> 01:18:38.644
I'll be lucky if I don't fry
myself.

01:18:48.482 --> 01:18:50.933
- Carlos?

01:18:58.526 --> 01:18:59.355
Carlos?

01:19:27.452 --> 01:19:29.765
Whatever bacteria is
pumping through my blood,

01:19:31.836 --> 01:19:34.321
I hope it
poisons every one of you.

01:20:05.801 --> 01:20:07.941
- How fucking dumb are we?

01:20:25.959 --> 01:20:29.410
Spare tire woulda
been a good idea.

01:20:29.445 --> 01:20:30.239
Have to remember
that the next time

01:20:30.273 --> 01:20:32.310
I'm fleeing vampires cross
country.

01:21:13.489 --> 01:21:15.077
- Oh fuck, come on.

01:21:48.420 --> 01:21:50.595
This would be a
lot fucking easier

01:21:50.629 --> 01:21:51.941
if I knew how to sail!

01:22:09.648 --> 01:22:12.410
- Hey guys, I found us...

01:22:19.210 --> 01:22:20.107
No, no, no!

01:22:55.004 --> 01:22:56.316
- Mitchell's gonna kill me.

01:23:13.264 --> 01:23:14.679
Look what I found!

01:23:14.713 --> 01:23:15.680
- How dumb are we?

01:23:17.026 --> 01:23:17.958
-  No luck?

01:23:17.993 --> 01:23:19.063
-  Found a boat.

01:23:19.097 --> 01:23:20.029
Guess we don't need it.

01:23:20.064 --> 01:23:21.030
- Guess not.

01:23:30.212 --> 01:23:33.008
Looks like Mitchell hit gold,
too.

01:23:34.216 --> 01:23:35.044
- Ray.

01:23:36.321 --> 01:23:37.150
Come here.

01:23:42.810 --> 01:23:44.226
Deja shitty.

01:23:44.260 --> 01:23:45.089
- What do you...

01:23:46.642 --> 01:23:47.470
Oh.

01:23:52.027 --> 01:23:52.855
- Yeah.

01:23:54.305 --> 01:23:55.892
- What?

01:23:55.927 --> 01:23:57.135
It obviously wasn't
them that drove it here.

01:23:57.170 --> 01:23:59.620
I mean, the windshield ain't a
sun shield.

01:24:00.690 --> 01:24:01.519
- Yeah.

01:24:04.211 --> 01:24:06.317
- Come on, it's getting dark.

01:24:06.351 --> 01:24:08.284
Probably both locked out by now
anyway.

01:24:17.397 --> 01:24:18.225
Or not.

01:24:27.027 --> 01:24:27.855
Guys.

01:24:30.548 --> 01:24:33.137
You wanna turn on the lights
before we break our necks?

01:24:33.171 --> 01:24:34.828
- I don't like this.

01:24:58.438 --> 01:24:59.232
- Shit!

01:25:02.545 --> 01:25:03.960
- Get in the van!

01:25:21.323 --> 01:25:22.151
Come on.

01:25:46.348 --> 01:25:47.176
Get off your clothes.

01:25:47.211 --> 01:25:48.004
- What?

01:25:48.039 --> 01:25:49.558
- Just fucking trust me.

01:25:54.114 --> 01:25:55.943
Smear it all over yourself.

01:26:15.998 --> 01:26:17.620
Get it in your hair, too.

01:26:19.035 --> 01:26:20.209
-  Why?

01:26:20.244 --> 01:26:21.797
-  We used to do
this when we were kids.

01:26:21.831 --> 01:26:24.662
It would mask our body odor
and keeps the mosquitoes away.

01:26:26.077 --> 01:26:27.354
- These aren't mosquitoes!

01:26:27.389 --> 01:26:29.011
- Well, you better hope it
works the same on vampires

01:26:29.045 --> 01:26:31.565
or we've got like
five minutes to live.

01:26:52.310 --> 01:26:54.347
Bury yourself in the leaves.

01:27:40.669 --> 01:27:42.118
- How long do we wait here?

01:27:42.153 --> 01:27:44.086
-  Till morning.

01:28:17.015 --> 01:28:18.293
- They took the door off.

01:28:51.912 --> 01:28:52.741
Where's Carlos?

01:29:29.122 --> 01:29:32.401
They musta been in the
house the whole time.

01:29:32.436 --> 01:29:33.298
Musta been.

01:29:35.059 --> 01:29:36.405
- Why'd they leave it then?

01:29:38.165 --> 01:29:39.028
- Too easy.

01:29:40.444 --> 01:29:41.306
If we'd have known
they were in there,

01:29:41.341 --> 01:29:43.343
we coulda just burned
the whole place

01:29:43.378 --> 01:29:44.344
down around 'em.

01:29:50.661 --> 01:29:52.076
- Come on.

01:29:52.110 --> 01:29:52.939
- Come on where?

01:29:54.181 --> 01:29:55.838
- Take you to that boat I found.

01:29:55.873 --> 01:29:57.426
You know how to sail?

01:29:57.461 --> 01:30:00.360
- I told you, like 60 miles up
the lake

01:30:00.395 --> 01:30:02.431
we got a boat of our own.

01:30:02.466 --> 01:30:03.915
- Well, come on,
we'll get it back here,

01:30:03.950 --> 01:30:06.159
load it with supplies
and get outta here.

01:30:11.440 --> 01:30:12.648
What are you waiting for?

01:30:14.374 --> 01:30:15.720
- I don't wanna keep running.

01:30:16.825 --> 01:30:17.929
- We went through this yesterday

01:30:17.964 --> 01:30:20.484
and our situation
is a lot worse.

01:30:20.518 --> 01:30:21.864
They took the door.

01:30:21.899 --> 01:30:23.901
They took our weapons.

01:30:23.935 --> 01:30:26.628
They wrecked the only two
vehicles we managed to find.

01:30:26.662 --> 01:30:28.699
We can't stay here.

01:30:28.733 --> 01:30:30.459
-  I don't wanna stay here.

01:30:30.494 --> 01:30:32.427
- What do you want then?

01:30:32.461 --> 01:30:33.980
- Revenge.

01:30:34.014 --> 01:30:34.808
- Ugh.

01:30:38.881 --> 01:30:43.541
Revenge?

01:30:43.576 --> 01:30:44.887
Fuck.

01:30:44.922 --> 01:30:46.544
Ray, let's just go.

01:30:47.718 --> 01:30:50.790
I mean, killing them
accomplishes nothing.

01:30:50.824 --> 01:30:53.586
What will it mean if
we kill off 10 or 15

01:30:53.620 --> 01:30:54.897
out of several billion.

01:30:54.932 --> 01:30:57.417
- It would mean
something to Carlos

01:30:57.452 --> 01:31:01.421
and Bailey, Mitchell, Eric.

01:31:02.733 --> 01:31:04.010
- Eric's one of them now.

01:31:05.390 --> 01:31:07.738
Only thing it would mean
to him is a bad night.

01:31:08.877 --> 01:31:10.982
- Little revenge never hurt
nobody, right?

01:31:12.708 --> 01:31:13.778
- I was angry then.

01:31:15.331 --> 01:31:17.679
Now I'm just tired.

01:31:17.713 --> 01:31:18.680
I'm scared.

01:31:19.957 --> 01:31:22.580
If you wanted revenge why
didn't you take it before

01:31:22.615 --> 01:31:25.100
on behalf of your wife
and your daughter?

01:31:26.032 --> 01:31:26.998
- They're not dead.

01:31:28.137 --> 01:31:29.622
- You don't know that.

01:31:29.656 --> 01:31:31.106
- It's a choice.

01:31:31.140 --> 01:31:32.003
They're not dead.

01:31:33.039 --> 01:31:34.937
Until I see a body,
they are not dead.

01:31:36.214 --> 01:31:40.287
Carlos, Bailey, Mitchell,
Mitchell, they're dead.

01:31:42.048 --> 01:31:43.774
I don't know how
to qualify Eric.

01:31:43.808 --> 01:31:46.362
But whatever he is now, the
before Eric

01:31:47.778 --> 01:31:48.917
he'd want revenge.

01:32:00.618 --> 01:32:01.481
Not dead.

01:32:13.286 --> 01:32:14.425
- What do you wanna do?

01:32:17.083 --> 01:32:17.980
What should I bring?

01:32:18.015 --> 01:32:20.327
- Food, just enough
for a few days,

01:32:20.362 --> 01:32:22.951
clothes, oh and the antibiotics.

01:32:32.581 --> 01:32:35.273
We tie it off here,
angle out at the harbor.

01:32:36.343 --> 01:32:37.690
It's a good run back to the farm

01:32:37.724 --> 01:32:39.968
so whether my plan works or not,

01:32:40.002 --> 01:32:41.763
be ready to sprint.

01:32:41.797 --> 01:32:44.041
- Why not park it somewhere
closer then?

01:32:44.075 --> 01:32:45.111
- Can't.

01:32:45.145 --> 01:32:48.252
Boat that size would
beach in shallower water.

01:32:48.286 --> 01:32:50.392
Besides, I don't want
them to see us.

01:32:51.462 --> 01:32:53.568
I want them thinking we're
still in that shelter.

01:33:38.578 --> 01:33:39.406
- Now what?

01:33:40.684 --> 01:33:41.685
We wait?

01:33:41.719 --> 01:33:42.617
-  Not just.

01:33:45.171 --> 01:33:45.999
- Drink it?

01:33:47.587 --> 01:33:48.830
How much?

01:33:48.864 --> 01:33:50.625
- Till just before you
think you're gonna puke.

01:33:50.659 --> 01:33:54.456
Actually, here take a
couple of these, too.

01:33:54.490 --> 01:33:56.009
- What for?

01:33:56.044 --> 01:33:57.286
- Just fucking trust me.

01:34:07.607 --> 01:34:10.230
- Fuck, Ray, I really
have to go.

01:34:10.265 --> 01:34:11.404
- We want a fresh scent here.

01:34:11.438 --> 01:34:12.543
Just give it five more minutes.

01:34:12.577 --> 01:34:14.096
-  No!

01:34:14.131 --> 01:34:15.304
- Fine.

01:34:15.339 --> 01:34:16.685
- Wait outside.

01:34:16.720 --> 01:34:17.824
- For Christ sake, Vicky,

01:34:17.859 --> 01:34:19.239
we spent last
night together naked.

01:34:19.274 --> 01:34:20.447
We're about to get naked
together again.

01:34:20.482 --> 01:34:21.345
What difference does it make?

01:34:21.379 --> 01:34:23.002
- Some things a
girl does in private.

01:34:33.737 --> 01:34:35.704
So, I don't get it.

01:34:35.739 --> 01:34:38.120
Why do we have to pop the
antibiotics?

01:34:42.193 --> 01:34:43.401
Never mind.

01:34:48.337 --> 01:34:49.131
Your turn.

01:35:54.541 --> 01:35:55.715
Wait!

01:38:18.962 --> 01:38:20.480
Are you okay?

01:38:20.515 --> 01:38:21.930
- Uh, I think so.

01:38:28.109 --> 01:38:28.937
- Okay.

01:38:43.710 --> 01:38:44.849
What now?

01:38:44.884 --> 01:38:46.541
We're just on the run again.

01:38:46.575 --> 01:38:47.749
- No, we're not.

01:38:48.888 --> 01:38:51.097
We've got a
destination and a plan.

01:38:52.133 --> 01:38:52.961
Least I do.

01:38:52.996 --> 01:38:54.204
- Care to fill me in?

01:38:55.343 --> 01:38:57.932
- Gonna head on down to
my cottage in Grand Bend.

01:38:57.966 --> 01:38:58.967
- And then?

01:39:00.244 --> 01:39:02.005
- Then I'm gonna find 'em.

01:39:02.039 --> 01:39:03.903
- No revenge?

01:39:03.938 --> 01:39:05.525
- No.

01:39:05.560 --> 01:39:06.354
No more revenge.

01:39:06.388 --> 01:39:07.493
I'm done with that.

01:39:07.527 --> 01:39:09.115
- What then?

01:39:09.150 --> 01:39:10.151
- Amanda and Rachel.

01:39:11.117 --> 01:39:12.394
- Your wife and daughter.

01:39:13.740 --> 01:39:14.949
- They're alive, Vicky.

01:39:16.019 --> 01:39:16.847
It's a choice.

01:39:16.881 --> 01:39:17.744
They're still alive.

01:39:18.780 --> 01:39:21.852
- And if they're not?

01:39:21.886 --> 01:39:23.819
- Then they're dead.

01:39:23.854 --> 01:39:26.167
Even if I have to kill them.
