00:12.770 --> 00:15.023
Legend has it
that it was written by the Dark Ones.

00:15.690 --> 00:17.609
Necronomicon ex Mortis,

00:18.693 --> 00:23.615
roughly translated, "Book of the Dead".

00:26.784 --> 00:31.456
The book served as a passageway
to the evil worlds beyond..

00:36.711 --> 00:38.630
It was written long ago.

00:40.715 --> 00:42.800
When the seas ran red with blood.

00:44.719 --> 00:47.805
It was this blood that was used to ink the book.

00:53.728 --> 00:57.815
In the year 1300 AD, the book disappeared.

01:14.749 --> 01:16.668
"EVIL DEAD II"

01:32.684 --> 01:34.602
So what's this place like?

01:34.769 --> 01:38.523
Well it's a little run-down...
but, uh, it's right up in the mountains.

01:38.773 --> 01:40.692
Are you sure it's deserted?

01:40.692 --> 01:45.780
Oh yeah... I think so.

02:26.738 --> 02:28.656
So what do you think kid?

02:31.784 --> 02:33.661
I love it Ash.

02:43.755 --> 02:45.673
I feel funny about being here.

02:45.673 --> 02:47.592
What if the people who own the place come home?

02:47.717 --> 02:49.594
They're not gonna come back.

02:49.761 --> 02:53.681
Even if they do we'll tell them the car
broke down or something like that.

02:53.723 --> 02:55.058
With your car, they'd believe it.

02:56.768 --> 02:59.771
Hey, what do you say
we have some champagne hey baby?

03:00.772 --> 03:01.773
Sure.

03:02.774 --> 03:07.028
After all, I'm a man and you're a woman,
at least last time I checked....

03:27.215 --> 03:30.468
Hey! There's a...
There's a tape recorder here.

03:31.719 --> 03:32.720
See what's on it.

03:35.723 --> 03:36.724
This is Professor Raymond Knowby,

03:39.727 --> 03:41.646
Department of Ancient History,
log entry number two.

03:42.730 --> 03:46.734
I believe I have made a significant find
in the Castle of Candar.

03:47.735 --> 03:49.737
Having journeyed there with my wife Henrietta, my
daughter Annie and associate professor Ed Getley.

03:54.742 --> 03:59.414
It was in the rear chamber of the castle
that we stumbled upon something remarkable.

04:00.748 --> 04:06.838
Morturom Demonto, the "Book of the Dead".

04:08.756 --> 04:13.678
My wife and I brought the book to this cabin where
I could study it undisturbed.

04:17.765 --> 04:19.684
It was here that I began the translations.

04:20.767 --> 04:22.687
The book speaks of a spiritual presence.,

04:23.771 --> 04:29.444
A thing of evil that roams
the forests and the dark bowers of man's domain..

04:30.778 --> 04:32.697
It is through the recitation of the book's passages...

04:33.698 --> 04:39.704
that this dark spirit is given
license to possess the living.

04:41.789 --> 04:46.210
Included here are the phonetic pronunciations
of those passages.

04:48.713 --> 04:52.717
"Cunda astratta montose

04:54.719 --> 04:56.721
eargrets gutt

04:58.806 --> 05:06.814
nos veratoos canda amantos canda".

09:50.848 --> 09:52.809
It's gone. The sun's driven it away.

10:03.861 --> 10:05.738
Yeah. For now.
Gotta blow out of here for now...

10:19.877 --> 10:21.796
Join us.

11:17.852 --> 11:20.855
Gotta, I gotta get a grip on myself here..

14:25.873 --> 14:26.958
How'd the expedition go?

14:26.958 --> 14:29.711
Great. I found the pages of the Book of the Dead.

14:29.877 --> 14:33.548
Yeah, I got your telegram. Thanks.
So what condition are they in?

14:33.881 --> 14:35.800
Take a look.

14:36.884 --> 14:37.885
They haven't aged a day in 3000 years.

14:37.885 --> 14:39.804
Maybe longer.

14:40.888 --> 14:41.889
When do we begin the translations?

14:41.889 --> 14:44.642
Tonight. Is everything all set with my father?

14:44.892 --> 14:47.478
Well, it should be
but I haven't spoken with him in a week.

14:47.895 --> 14:49.814
There's no phone in the cabin.

14:50.898 --> 14:52.817
We'll take my car, it'll take us about
an hour to get there.

14:55.403 --> 14:59.407
Annie you hinted in your telegram that your father was onto
something in the first part of his translations.

14:59.907 --> 15:00.908
What has he found in the Book of the Dead?

15:00.908 --> 15:06.831
Probably nothing. But just possibly,
a doorway to another world?

18:32.954 --> 18:34.872
Dance with me.

19:25.006 --> 19:26.924
Hello lover.

19:58.957 --> 20:00.875
Workshed.

20:32.991 --> 20:37.412
Even now we have your darling Linda's soul.

20:37.996 --> 20:40.748
She suffers in torment.

20:40.915 --> 20:45.837
You're going down. Chainsaw.

21:36.971 --> 21:40.308
Please Ash... please don't hurt me.

21:40.934 --> 21:44.979
You swore- you swore that we'd always be together.

21:46.981 --> 21:48.900
I love you.

21:51.986 --> 21:55.073
Yah! Your lover is mine
and now she burns

21:55.740 --> 21:57.825
in Hell.

24:30.979 --> 24:32.897
Oh yeah, alright... OK.

24:42.073 --> 24:43.992
I'm fine... I'm fine.

24:44.075 --> 24:47.662
I don't think so. We just cut up
our girlfriend with a chainsaw.

24:47.996 --> 24:50.748
Does that sound fine?

25:51.059 --> 25:57.732
You bastards! You dirty bastards!

26:06.074 --> 26:09.077
Give me back my hand!

26:11.996 --> 26:16.167
Give me back my haaaaand!!

26:54.038 --> 26:55.957
Excuse me. Excuse me.

26:57.041 --> 26:58.960
Is this the road to the Knowby cabin?

27:00.044 --> 27:01.963
That's right. And you ain't going there.

27:03.131 --> 27:05.049
And why not?

27:16.060 --> 27:18.062
There must be another way in.

27:18.730 --> 27:19.731
There's gotta be another road or something.

27:20.064 --> 27:21.983
Sure ain't no road.

27:27.071 --> 27:30.992
Why the hell do you want to go up there for anyway?

27:35.997 --> 27:37.915
None of your business.

27:44.088 --> 27:46.758
Hey! I just remembered.

27:47.091 --> 27:50.011
Why, yeah... that's right. There is a trail.

27:50.011 --> 27:52.931
You could uh, follow Bobby Joe and me.

27:54.098 --> 27:56.017
Sounds alright to me.

27:56.100 --> 27:57.101
But it'll cost ya.

27:57.101 --> 27:59.020
How much?

27:59.103 --> 28:04.025
Forty fi...
Hundred bucks.

28:05.026 --> 28:09.948
Tell ya what, you take my bags
and you got a deal.

28:13.117 --> 28:15.036
Sure.

30:07.065 --> 30:10.068
Ah. Ah. That's right. Who's laughing now?

30:19.077 --> 30:22.080
Who's laughing now?

31:11.129 --> 31:13.047
Jesus H. Christ...
thought all she was talking about

31:13.631 --> 31:15.633
were those two Goddamn little bags.

31:26.144 --> 31:29.147
Here's your new home.

31:38.740 --> 31:41.743
"BÚCSÚ A FEGYVEREKTÕL"

33:09.163 --> 33:10.164
Son of a....

33:33.104 --> 33:35.690
Gotcha didn't I you little sucker?!

34:09.139 --> 34:11.059
Old double barrel here...

34:11.141 --> 34:16.731
blow your butts to kingdom come.
See if we don't...

37:15.243 --> 37:17.161
You little bastard!

37:20.248 --> 37:22.166
You gonna be alright honey?

37:22.166 --> 37:24.794
I-I don't know. I-I think so.

37:31.175 --> 37:31.175
You just sit still for a minute.
You know this son of a bitch?

37:31.175 --> 37:33.094
No we thought her father
was going to be here.

37:33.177 --> 37:34.178
That's why we decided -

37:34.178 --> 37:36.097
Oh my God! Where are my parents?

37:49.193 --> 37:51.112
What the hell did you do to them?

37:53.197 --> 37:55.116
What the hell did you do to them?

37:57.201 --> 37:59.120
Annie, come here.

38:04.167 --> 38:06.127
We'll throw him in there.

38:10.173 --> 38:12.050
Crazy buck's gone blood seeking.

38:13.217 --> 38:17.055
Wait.
I made a mistake.

38:23.186 --> 38:25.146
Wait. Wait. Wait.

38:27.231 --> 38:28.232
I made a mistake.

38:28.232 --> 38:30.151
Damn right. Blackmail son of a bitch.

38:39.243 --> 38:41.162
I hope you rot down there.

38:51.256 --> 38:52.173
Oh shit!

38:52.173 --> 38:54.092
I know it hurts baby,
but everything's gonna be fine.

38:59.180 --> 39:01.182
Now in about five minutes
I'm gonna go fetch the sheriff and bring him-

39:02.183 --> 39:04.102
Checked all the other rooms.

39:04.185 --> 39:06.104
Folks aren't here. Maybe they never came.

39:06.271 --> 39:08.189
But these are my father's things.

39:11.192 --> 39:15.113
It's only been a few hours since I've translated
and spoken aloud the first of the demon resurrection

39:15.280 --> 39:18.199
passages from the Book of the Dead.

39:19.200 --> 39:21.077
Shhh... Listen up. This is my father's voice.

39:24.205 --> 39:29.127
And now I fear that my wife
has become host to a Candarian Demon.

39:31.212 --> 39:35.133
May God forgive me for what I have unleashed
unto this earth.

39:36.175 --> 39:38.136
Last night Henrietta tried to...

39:39.721 --> 39:40.972
kill me.

39:43.224 --> 39:45.143
It's now October 1st, 4:33 PM.

39:48.187 --> 39:50.148
Henrietta is dead. I could not bring

39:52.233 --> 39:54.152
myself to dismember her corpse.
But I dragged her down the steps...

40:01.200 --> 40:04.162
and I buried her. I buried her in the cellar.

40:05.163 --> 40:07.081
God help me,

40:07.206 --> 40:10.251
I buried her in the earthen floor
of the fruit cellar.

40:18.259 --> 40:19.177
What the hell was that?

40:19.177 --> 40:21.095
Somebody's down there with him.

40:22.180 --> 40:23.264
No, can't be.

40:23.264 --> 40:24.182
Let's get the fuck out of here.

40:24.182 --> 40:33.107
Someone's in my fruit cellar.
Someone with a fresh soul!

40:35.276 --> 40:37.195
Let me out! There's something down here! Ah!

40:39.280 --> 40:39.280
Let him out!

40:39.280 --> 40:41.199
It's a trick, I know it!

40:41.199 --> 40:43.117
Let him out!!

40:43.201 --> 40:44.285
Move it! Open those chains up!

40:44.285 --> 40:46.204
Come to me.

40:48.206 --> 40:50.124
Ah! Help! Help! Help me!

40:50.208 --> 40:52.126
Come to sweet Henrietta. Hahaha.

40:59.217 --> 41:01.177
Hurry!

41:02.220 --> 41:04.138
Help! Help me please!

41:06.224 --> 41:08.184
I'll swallow your soul.

41:25.243 --> 41:27.161
Do something!

42:35.271 --> 42:37.148
There's something out there.

42:39.317 --> 42:44.238
That... that witch in the cellar is only part of it.

42:47.241 --> 42:54.749
It lives... out in those woods, in the dark...

42:56.334 --> 43:03.925
something... something that's come back from the dead.

43:04.259 --> 43:06.552
Plee! Please let's just get the hell out of here!

43:07.262 --> 43:09.138
We're going baby. We're going to get on that trail-

43:10.181 --> 43:12.100
Nobody's going out that door, not till daylight.

43:14.269 --> 43:16.187
Now you listen to me -

43:42.255 --> 43:44.215
Remember that song Annie? I used to sing it
to you when you were a baby.

43:45.300 --> 43:47.218
Mother?

43:48.261 --> 43:50.138
Unlock these chains. Quickly!

43:59.314 --> 44:00.231
No.

44:00.231 --> 44:04.694
You were born September 2nd, 1962.

44:05.236 --> 44:12.160
I remember it well because it was snowing. So strange

44:12.327 --> 44:13.286
it would be snowing in September.

44:17.332 --> 44:19.292
That thing in the cellar is not my mother.

44:28.760 --> 44:32.764
We are the things that were and shall be again.

44:35.266 --> 44:36.225
Steps of the Book.

44:37.268 --> 44:39.270
We want what is yours.

44:40.271 --> 44:42.231
Life! Dead by dawn. Dead by dawn.

44:42.273 --> 44:43.274
Dead by dawn. Dead by dawn.

44:43.274 --> 44:45.193
Dead by dawn.

44:46.277 --> 44:48.196
Dead by dawn.

45:04.128 --> 45:05.171
Let me out.

45:05.296 --> 45:07.298
Thirsty son-of-a-bitch.

45:18.726 --> 45:22.230
Where you going? Help us you filthy coward!

45:44.335 --> 45:46.254
We live still!

46:27.378 --> 46:29.297
That's funny.

46:29.297 --> 46:31.215
What?

46:32.300 --> 46:34.302
That trail we came in here on?

46:36.304 --> 46:38.556
It just ain't there no more.

46:40.308 --> 46:46.230
Like, like the woods just swallowed her up.

47:09.337 --> 47:10.672
It's so quiet.

47:59.304 --> 48:04.225
Maybe something trying to force
its way into our world.

48:41.262 --> 48:43.181
Hell no. You're the curious one.

49:04.369 --> 49:09.958
Hey. I'll go with you.

50:05.346 --> 50:09.267
Shit. I told you there weren't nothing
in here no how.

50:35.376 --> 50:37.295
Holy Mother o' Mercy.

50:38.379 --> 50:39.380
Father?

50:39.380 --> 50:41.299
Annie.

50:41.299 --> 50:47.722
There is a dark spirit here
that wants to destroy you.

50:48.306 --> 50:52.393
Your salvation lies there.

50:59.400 --> 51:05.323
In the pages of the book.
Recite the passages.

51:06.407 --> 51:16.918
Dispel the evil. Save my soul.
And your own lives!

51:27.428 --> 51:30.348
Jake. You're holding my hand too tight.

51:32.433 --> 51:34.352
Baby, I ain't holding your hand.

51:55.373 --> 51:57.292
Hey? Where's Bobby Joe?

53:50.405 --> 53:53.074
Hey? Where the hell is she?

54:06.421 --> 54:08.339
We gotta go out there and find her.

54:08.423 --> 54:12.093
If she went out in those woods,
you can forget about her.

54:18.433 --> 54:20.351
What's wrong?

54:21.436 --> 54:24.355
Felt like someone just walked over my grave.

54:29.360 --> 54:31.279
What's that picture?
What is that?

54:33.448 --> 54:38.286
In 1300 AD they called this man the, ah,
hero from the sky.

54:40.455 --> 54:42.373
He was prophesied to have destroyed the Evil.

54:44.459 --> 54:48.379
Didn't do a very good job...  Can you find it?

54:50.381 --> 54:52.300
Here it is, two passages.

54:58.389 --> 55:00.308
Recitation of this first passage..

55:03.478 --> 55:07.398
will make this dark spirit manifest itself
in the flesh.

55:10.401 --> 55:12.320
Why the hell would we want to do that?

55:12.403 --> 55:14.322
Recitation of this second passage creates

55:17.408 --> 55:19.327
a kind of rift in time and space.

55:22.413 --> 55:24.332
And the physical manifestation of this

55:25.416 --> 55:26.417
dark spirit can be forced back into the rift.

55:26.417 --> 55:28.336
At least that's the best translation that I can -

55:31.422 --> 55:35.343
That's right. I'm running the show now.

55:36.427 --> 55:38.846
We're going to go out there in them woods
and look for Bobby Joe.

55:39.430 --> 55:41.349
Once we find her
we're getting the hell out of here.

55:42.433 --> 55:45.687
No you idiot! You'll kill us all.

55:47.438 --> 55:49.357
She's dead by now.

55:49.440 --> 55:51.359
Don't you understand?

55:52.443 --> 55:55.780
With these pages, at least we have a chance.

55:59.450 --> 56:01.369
Bunch of mumbo jumbo bullshit.

56:04.455 --> 56:06.374
These pages don't mean squat.

56:13.464 --> 56:16.384
Besides, now you ain't got no choice.

56:17.385 --> 56:19.304
Now move!

56:28.479 --> 56:30.398
Move.

56:30.481 --> 56:32.400
Look. You're nuts.

56:34.402 --> 56:36.321
I said move!

56:42.493 --> 56:44.412
I'll blow your fucken head off.

57:31.459 --> 57:35.380
Hey. No trail. Where to now?

58:00.405 --> 58:01.489
You'll get us all killed!

58:01.489 --> 58:03.408
Shut up!

58:03.491 --> 58:04.492
Leave him alone!

58:04.492 --> 58:06.411
Get outta here...

58:21.426 --> 58:23.344
Where are you, girl?

58:54.459 --> 58:56.377
You're next. Annie!

01:01:45.463 --> 01:01:47.382
I'm sorry!

01:01:48.466 --> 01:01:50.385
Get me another room.
Get the axe.

01:01:50.468 --> 01:01:52.387
We'll kill it when it comes back.

01:01:55.473 --> 01:01:57.392
But first, pull this damn thing out of me!

01:02:09.487 --> 01:02:11.406
I can't breathe, I can't breathe. Hurry!

01:02:13.575 --> 01:02:15.493
I'm trying! I'm trying!

01:02:26.504 --> 01:02:30.425
Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!

01:02:56.534 --> 01:02:58.453
Check outside the windows.

01:03:01.539 --> 01:03:03.458
Check the windows, he's probably right out...

01:03:04.542 --> 01:03:06.461
Ahhh! Help me!

01:03:36.491 --> 01:03:38.409
Oh God! Ahhhhh!

01:05:12.503 --> 01:05:15.423
No! No wait!

01:05:17.592 --> 01:05:21.512
Listen to me! I'm alright now.

01:05:21.512 --> 01:05:23.431
That thing is gone!

01:05:36.527 --> 01:05:38.780
Damn it! I said I was alright!

01:05:39.614 --> 01:05:41.532
Are you listening to me?

01:05:43.534 --> 01:05:47.455
You hear what I'm saying?
I'm alright!

01:05:51.626 --> 01:05:53.544
I'm alright.

01:05:55.546 --> 01:06:00.051
OK, maybe you are. But for how long?

01:06:04.555 --> 01:06:07.475
If we're going to beat this thing,
we need those pages.

01:06:11.562 --> 01:06:15.733
Then let's head down into that cellar
and carve ourselves a witch.

01:07:04.616 --> 01:07:06.534
Groovy.

01:07:50.578 --> 01:07:52.497
Those pages are down there somewhere.

01:10:56.598 --> 01:11:00.518
"Nos veratos alamemnon conda."

01:11:56.574 --> 01:11:57.575
Let's go.

01:12:30.692 --> 01:12:32.610
I'll swallow your soul.
I'll swallow your soul.

01:13:25.663 --> 01:13:27.582
Hey! I'll swallow your soul!
I'll swallow your soul!

01:13:30.668 --> 01:13:32.587
Swallow this.

01:15:03.761 --> 01:15:05.680
I only completed the first of the passages

01:15:06.681 --> 01:15:08.641
and that was to make the Evil a thing of the flesh!

01:15:16.691 --> 01:15:18.568
Finish it!

01:15:19.652 --> 01:15:21.613
There's still the second passage.

01:15:26.701 --> 01:15:26.701
The one-

01:15:26.701 --> 01:15:28.703
the one to open the rift and send the Evil back!

01:15:29.621 --> 01:15:32.582
Well start reciting it! Now!

01:15:45.678 --> 01:15:47.639
Don't look Annie! Finish the passages!
Get rid of it!

01:16:09.661 --> 01:16:11.579
No!!!

01:17:07.719 --> 01:17:09.596
We've won. We've won. Victory is ours.

01:17:42.754 --> 01:17:44.672
You did it kid.

01:18:18.790 --> 01:18:20.792
By God... No!!!! For God's sake!

01:18:20.792 --> 01:18:22.710
How do you stop it?

01:19:40.747 --> 01:19:42.624
Slay the beast. It is a deadite!

01:19:43.708 --> 01:19:45.627
Run! Back to the castle!

01:20:21.746 --> 01:20:23.665
Hail he who has come from the skies

01:20:24.749 --> 01:20:26.668
to deliver us from the terrors of the deadites!

01:20:28.753 --> 01:20:30.672
Hail! Hail! Hail!

01:20:33.758 --> 01:20:35.677
No! No!! No!!! No!!!!!!
