00:00.520 --> 00:02.260
NARRATOR: Tonight on
\hBeyond Oak Island...

00:02.260 --> 00:05.260
Sam Bass was
a notorious train robber.

00:05.260 --> 00:07.060
He must have been
quite successful.

00:07.060 --> 00:10.190
In just one robbery,
he got $60,000

00:10.190 --> 00:11.660
in newly minted $20-gold pieces.

00:11.660 --> 00:14.520
JAMESON:
He buried them
in four different caches.

00:14.520 --> 00:17.720
We have located two
of his known hideouts.

00:17.720 --> 00:19.230
-Go find it.
-Absolutely.

00:19.230 --> 00:22.260
-MATTY: I’m coming in. (grunts)
-GYPSY: What do you see?

00:22.260 --> 00:24.060
-There’s another little chamber
in there.
-GYPSY: Really?

00:24.060 --> 00:26.260
-Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
-DONNA: What is it?

00:26.260 --> 00:29.130
-A coin.
-That’s a coin.

00:30.330 --> 00:31.660
All the while
we were growing up,

00:31.660 --> 00:36.190
my brother and I were fascinated
with finding treasure.

00:36.660 --> 00:37.720
RICK:
Pirate treasure,

00:37.720 --> 00:39.390
cursed treasure.

00:39.390 --> 00:40.590
Civil War gold.

00:40.590 --> 00:43.660
-(laughter)
-Since then,
our work on Oak Island

00:43.660 --> 00:46.190
has shown us
there’s a world of mysteries...

00:46.190 --> 00:48.520
-Whoa.
-...waiting to be explored.

00:48.520 --> 00:51.720
RICK:
So, we like to reach out
to other treasure hunters.

00:51.720 --> 00:54.000
X marks the spot, right there.
Brilliant.

00:54.000 --> 00:56.260
-MARTY: We want to hear
their stories...
-That’s right.

00:56.260 --> 00:59.000
-...and share our insights.
-"Ill-gotten gains."

00:59.000 --> 01:00.390
-RICK: And who knows...
-GARY: I got it.

01:00.390 --> 01:02.390
...maybe we can help them
with their search.

01:02.390 --> 01:04.330
MARTY:
Not only in America.

01:04.330 --> 01:05.590
Wow. That is gold.

01:05.590 --> 01:07.660
-RICK: But all over the world.
-Yeah!

01:07.660 --> 01:10.190
MARTY:
\hBeyond Oak Island.

01:18.260 --> 01:22.390
\hMATTY: You know what I love
is when the treasure mystery

01:22.390 --> 01:25.460
matches the allure
of the personalities involved.

01:25.460 --> 01:28.330
You know what I mean?
When you have a huge personality

01:28.330 --> 01:30.000
-involved or a legend involved.
-Sure.

01:30.000 --> 01:30.620
You mean like Rick Lagina?

01:30.620 --> 01:32.390
-Bingo. Right.
-(chuckles): Yeah.

01:32.390 --> 01:35.000
-Well, like a Dan Blankenship.
-Dan Blankenship.

01:35.000 --> 01:36.000
Right? Or Fred Nolan?

01:36.000 --> 01:37.390
-Fred.
-Um, or even, you know,

01:37.390 --> 01:39.230
I think we all love
the American west.

01:39.230 --> 01:42.330
And-and those stories
attached to those guys--

01:42.330 --> 01:44.460
those gunslingers,
those legendary outlaws--

01:44.460 --> 01:45.520
it doesn’t get any better
than that for me.

01:45.520 --> 01:49.260
-Well, we grew up with that,
right? I mean...
-Yeah, of course.

01:49.260 --> 01:52.130
Think of the names associated
with the old west.

01:52.130 --> 01:54.520
It’s incredibly fascinating,
you know.

01:54.520 --> 01:56.060
Larger-than-life figures.

01:56.060 --> 01:58.090
Yeah, but the stuff I read
when I was a kid--

01:58.090 --> 01:59.390
and I was all enthralled
with people

01:59.390 --> 02:01.520
like Kit Carson
and stuff like that.

02:01.520 --> 02:03.460
This whole concept of
hero or villain

02:03.460 --> 02:05.330
keeps popping up
time and time again,

02:05.330 --> 02:07.390
depending on
which side you were on.

02:07.390 --> 02:09.260
-Right?
-MATTY: Absolutely.

02:09.260 --> 02:11.060
And you know
what was very interesting,

02:11.060 --> 02:13.130
in-in looking at outlaws,

02:13.130 --> 02:14.330
I was surprised actually

02:14.330 --> 02:17.390
by how many of them came
from the state of Texas.

02:17.390 --> 02:19.720
-Texas for sure.
-There you go.

02:19.720 --> 02:24.520
NARRATOR:
During the post-Civil War
years of the early 1870s,

02:24.520 --> 02:28.590
the state of Texas was still
very much frontier land.

02:28.590 --> 02:32.000
Because of its fertile
agricultural landscape,

02:32.000 --> 02:34.000
it offered great opportunities

02:34.000 --> 02:36.520
to those seeking legitimate
livelihoods in farming,

02:36.520 --> 02:39.390
ranching and mercantilism.

02:39.390 --> 02:41.660
However,
because of its vastness,

02:41.660 --> 02:44.590
it also became an ideal place
for those looking

02:44.590 --> 02:49.000
to escape debt, the weariness
of war and the law.

02:49.000 --> 02:52.520
Texas in the 1870s still had
a frontier to it.

02:52.520 --> 02:55.330
Up to that point in time,
law enforcement officials

02:55.330 --> 02:58.330
really were not adept
at chasing down bad guys.

02:58.330 --> 03:01.190
As a result, it was
fertile ground for outlaws

03:01.190 --> 03:06.330
and bad guys to come and find
a good hideaway and camp out.

03:06.330 --> 03:11.720
Opportunities in Texas,
uh, seemed to appeal to them.

03:11.720 --> 03:17.130
Travelers along the remote roads
were often stopped and robbed.

03:17.130 --> 03:19.000
Stagecoaches were
stopped and robbed.

03:19.000 --> 03:23.000
Sometimes payrolls that
were transported by stagecoaches

03:23.000 --> 03:24.660
or freight wagons were robbed.

03:24.660 --> 03:27.390
A lot of outlaws
took advantage of this.

03:27.490 --> 03:30.260
There are accounts
where hundreds of thousands

03:30.260 --> 03:32.390
of dollars’ worth
of usually gold coins

03:32.390 --> 03:33.520
were taken in a robbery.

03:33.520 --> 03:36.720
A couple of saddlebags
full of gold weighs a lot.

03:36.720 --> 03:41.660
And so, uh, in many cases
they simply hid their booty

03:41.660 --> 03:44.260
and then fled, again,
with the intention of

03:44.260 --> 03:47.460
coming back and retrieving it
at a later date.

03:47.460 --> 03:50.130
This particular case
that I’m kind of

03:50.130 --> 03:53.520
looking into right now involves
a guy named Sam Bass.

03:53.520 --> 03:57.460
-Mm-hmm.
-Some people call him
the Robin Hood of the west,

03:57.460 --> 04:01.130
that he stole from the rich
and gave to the poor.

04:01.130 --> 04:04.130
And I also know that
his reign was short, apparently.

04:04.130 --> 04:05.390
Then he must’ve been
quite infamous.

04:05.390 --> 04:06.260
He must’ve been
quite successful.

04:06.260 --> 04:10.130
-He could go...
-Well, yeah, a lot of them
were like that, weren’t they?

04:10.130 --> 04:11.520
Wasn’t Jesse James
pretty short-lived

04:11.520 --> 04:13.130
-and a lot of these guys?
-MATTY: Yeah.

04:13.130 --> 04:15.460
I think Sam Bass
fits exactly in that world

04:15.460 --> 04:20.190
of somewhere in the middle
of hero and villain, I guess.

04:20.190 --> 04:22.390
NARRATOR:
In 1869,

04:22.390 --> 04:24.190
Indiana native Sam Bass

04:24.190 --> 04:27.130
\hmade his way to Texas
at the young age of 18

04:27.130 --> 04:31.230
with initial plans
of pursuing a virtuous vocation.

04:31.230 --> 04:32.460
JAMESON:
Sam Bass

04:32.460 --> 04:35.390
had been, uh, attracted
to the state of Texas

04:35.390 --> 04:38.660
with tales of cowboying
and ranching

04:38.660 --> 04:41.000
and a certain amount of glamour

04:41.000 --> 04:43.660
that he saw associated,
uh, with this.

04:43.660 --> 04:47.000
NARRATOR:
After a successful stint
in horse racing,

04:47.000 --> 04:50.520
which earned him a taste
of small-time fame,

04:50.520 --> 04:52.060
Bass transitioned

04:52.060 --> 04:54.260
into herding cattle,
hoping it would lead

04:54.260 --> 04:56.390
to greater success in ranching.

04:56.390 --> 04:57.390
However,

04:57.390 --> 04:59.590
the grueling physical labor
and meager pay

04:59.590 --> 05:03.390
prompted him to consider
\hother, more daring ways

05:03.390 --> 05:04.720
to earn a living.

05:04.720 --> 05:06.130
Sam Bass, uh,

05:06.130 --> 05:08.720
he made friends
with a man named Joel Collins.

05:08.720 --> 05:11.260
And Collins came up
with the idea

05:11.260 --> 05:12.660
of putting together a herd

05:12.660 --> 05:17.260
and the whole notion of being
successful cattle ranchers.

05:17.260 --> 05:18.330
But that didn’t pay off,

05:18.330 --> 05:20.000
and they ran out of money
pretty quick.

05:20.000 --> 05:22.260
And they turned
to stage robbery.

05:22.260 --> 05:24.390
Some way of getting money.

05:24.390 --> 05:26.130
But Sam Bass,

05:26.130 --> 05:28.000
being an entrepreneurial sort,

05:28.000 --> 05:30.190
thought that there was
\hprobably a better way

05:30.190 --> 05:33.460
to do this,
and he focused on trains.

05:33.460 --> 05:38.260
NARRATOR:
Bass set his sights on a station
for the Union Pacific Railroad

05:38.260 --> 05:39.590
in Big Springs, Nebraska,

05:39.590 --> 05:44.360
and on the evening
of September 18, 1877,

05:44.360 --> 05:46.130
he and his gang pulled off

05:46.130 --> 05:50.060
one of the boldest
train robberies in history.

05:50.060 --> 05:51.330
So, they picked Big Springs,

05:51.330 --> 05:54.190
and they waited
for it to come into the station.

05:54.190 --> 05:56.590
They broke the telegraph machine
that the operator had

05:56.590 --> 05:59.000
in the station
and then went aboard.

05:59.000 --> 06:02.360
NARRATOR:
Once inside the train,
Bass and his men

06:02.360 --> 06:03.520
headed to the express car,

06:03.520 --> 06:06.330
where valuables
would commonly be kept.

06:06.330 --> 06:08.390
Although they were unable
to open

06:08.390 --> 06:10.460
the safe because of a time lock,

06:10.460 --> 06:14.060
they found three boxes
sitting next to it, unprotected.

06:14.060 --> 06:18.130
Upon opening one,
they were astonished to discover

06:18.130 --> 06:20.660
that it was filled
with gold coins.

06:20.660 --> 06:24.260
They made off
with, uh, $60,000 worth

06:24.260 --> 06:30.130
of, uh, freshly-minted
\h1877 $20 gold pieces.

06:30.130 --> 06:33.000
NARRATOR:
According to most estimates,

06:33.000 --> 06:35.520
this fortune
would be worth nearly

06:35.520 --> 06:37.260
six million dollars today.

06:37.260 --> 06:39.660
JAMESON:
They reached a point where
it was in their best interest

06:39.660 --> 06:42.260
to split the loot and split up
because it was clear

06:42.260 --> 06:45.130
that they were being pursued
by law enforcement.

06:45.130 --> 06:46.000
Sam Bass

06:46.000 --> 06:49.460
got back
to the Denton, Texas, area,

06:49.460 --> 06:52.000
and he was smart enough
to realize

06:52.000 --> 06:55.720
that it was dangerous to start
spending these things overtly,

06:55.720 --> 06:57.060
so he buried them.

06:57.060 --> 06:58.660
And the legend goes
that he buried them

06:58.660 --> 07:01.000
in four different caches,

07:01.000 --> 07:02.660
and after every robbery,
he would add

07:02.660 --> 07:06.720
his share of the booty
to one or more

07:06.720 --> 07:08.260
of those caches.

07:08.260 --> 07:11.000
I got contacted
by two treasure hunters.

07:11.000 --> 07:13.390
Um, this woman
named Donna McCauley,

07:13.390 --> 07:15.460
-MARTY: Mm-hmm.
-and this woman
named Michele Woods,

07:15.460 --> 07:17.520
who goes by the name
Gypsy Jewels,

07:17.520 --> 07:19.130
-which I love.
-(Rick and Marty chuckle)

07:19.130 --> 07:21.750
She’s like a...
kind of a female Gary Drayton.

07:21.750 --> 07:22.520
She’s a metal detectoress.

07:22.520 --> 07:25.260
-Oh, okay.
-MATTY: She’s great
at what she does.

07:25.260 --> 07:28.520
And these two believe firmly
that they are hot on the trail

07:28.520 --> 07:30.130
of a treasure

07:30.130 --> 07:31.660
stashed by Sam Bass

07:31.660 --> 07:33.590
in the 1870s sometime.

07:33.590 --> 07:36.390
Okay. Well, that sounds
like an interesting story.

07:36.390 --> 07:37.460
-Absolutely.
-They’re actually standing by.

07:37.460 --> 07:39.060
I’ve arranged a call.
Do you want to talk to them

07:39.060 --> 07:41.390
-Absolutely.
-and see if it’s something
you guys want to pursue?

07:41.390 --> 07:43.260
-Absolutely.
Put them on the screen.
-RICK: You bet.

07:43.260 --> 07:44.520
Great.

07:44.520 --> 07:47.520
\h-RICK: Hello, ladies.
-MARTY: Hello, ladies.

07:47.520 --> 07:49.590
\h-Hi.
-(Rick chuckles)
\h-Hi.

07:49.590 --> 07:52.520
-Welcome
to the Oak Island war room.
\h-Thank you.

07:52.520 --> 07:54.520
MATTY:
Yeah, it’s nice
to see you guys in person.

07:54.520 --> 07:57.720
Uh, which one is Donna,
and which one is Gypsy, please?

07:57.720 --> 08:00.260
-I’m Donna McCauley.
-And I’m Gypsy.

08:00.260 --> 08:03.130
-Pleasure to meet you two.
-RICK: Very nice
to meet you both.

08:03.130 --> 08:04.660
I’m Donna McCauley.

08:04.660 --> 08:08.130
I’m a treasure hunter
and a historian.

08:08.130 --> 08:08.620
And I’m on the board

08:08.620 --> 08:12.390
with the Parker County
Historical Commission.

08:12.390 --> 08:13.390
I’m Gypsy Jewels.

08:13.390 --> 08:16.260
I’ve been treasure hunting
almost all of my life.

08:16.260 --> 08:21.130
I’ve been metal detecting now
for a little over 22 years.

08:21.130 --> 08:23.360
I met Donna
through a mutual friend,

08:23.360 --> 08:25.520
and we instantly connected

08:25.520 --> 08:27.660
through our love
for metal detecting

08:27.660 --> 08:29.720
and treasure hunting
and history.

08:29.720 --> 08:34.520
DONNA:
I started metal detecting
probably about 40 years ago.

08:34.520 --> 08:36.460
My father had a metal detector.

08:36.460 --> 08:38.000
And I found silver dollars.

08:38.000 --> 08:41.130
I found a bunch
of Civil War pennies,

08:41.130 --> 08:45.130
1943 World War II steel pennies.

08:45.130 --> 08:49.000
I found a whole thing
of Mercury dimes.

08:49.000 --> 08:50.720
And, of course, Morgan dollars.

08:50.720 --> 08:52.260
I found a lot of those, too.

08:52.260 --> 08:55.060
And, uh, because of me
finding all those old coins

08:55.060 --> 08:57.330
over the years,
I just started collecting them.

08:57.330 --> 08:59.330
And that was really
how I started

08:59.330 --> 09:02.190
looking for Sam Bass’ coins

09:02.190 --> 09:04.190
from the Big Spring
train robbery.

09:04.190 --> 09:08.660
They took 60,000
of $20 Double Eagle gold pieces.

09:08.660 --> 09:11.390
And the mint is "S"
for San Francisco.

09:11.390 --> 09:14.660
And then after so many years,
there’s only one

09:14.660 --> 09:15.590
ever been found.

09:15.590 --> 09:16.720
So that’s just telling me

09:16.720 --> 09:18.390
that the coins
are still out there.

09:18.390 --> 09:20.330
So, I, you know, I have to ask.

09:20.330 --> 09:23.060
It sounds like
a pretty substantial treasure

09:23.060 --> 09:24.520
that could be found.
Do you have any idea

09:24.520 --> 09:26.130
what it might be worth if you...

09:26.130 --> 09:28.060
if you were to come up with it?

09:28.060 --> 09:32.090
Those 1877 coins
have to be pretty rare,

09:32.090 --> 09:35.130
and there’s not hardly any
known out there.

09:35.130 --> 09:37.660
Uh, it’s gonna increase
the value

09:37.660 --> 09:40.330
because you would be able
to trace that back

09:40.330 --> 09:42.520
to the actual train robbery.

09:42.520 --> 09:45.460
We think
it’s worth $1.5 million.

09:45.460 --> 09:48.260
But because of it
being museum-quality,

09:48.260 --> 09:51.000
it could be worth five million
or even more.

09:51.000 --> 09:52.660
-Oh, wow.
-Well, that’d be worth it.

09:52.660 --> 09:54.390
-MATTY: That’s worth a trip.
-(chuckles) Yeah.

09:54.390 --> 09:57.750
So, Donna here works
with the Historical Commission,

09:57.750 --> 10:00.520
and she’s done
a lot of local research

10:00.520 --> 10:03.130
and has helped us locate

10:03.130 --> 10:05.190
two of his known hideouts.

10:05.190 --> 10:06.460
-MARTY: Wow.
-MATTY: Wow.

10:06.460 --> 10:07.460
Tell us
about these two locations

10:07.460 --> 10:09.260
\hand why you think
they’re important.

10:09.260 --> 10:13.490
Well, the first location
is Springtown,

10:13.490 --> 10:16.130
and that’s called
Sam Bass Springs.

10:16.130 --> 10:19.060
They had named it after him
’cause he was known to be there.

10:19.060 --> 10:22.520
It has, to my knowledge,
never been metal detected.

10:22.520 --> 10:26.330
They would not allow people
on their land until recently.

10:26.330 --> 10:28.590
Some newer people
purchased these lands,

10:28.590 --> 10:30.390
and they’re
giving us permission.

10:30.390 --> 10:32.390
That’s perfect.
What about the other one?

10:32.390 --> 10:34.520
GYPSY:
So, the other one is

10:34.520 --> 10:36.330
at the base of East Mountain,

10:36.330 --> 10:40.660
where it is known
that Sam Bass hid out at.

10:40.660 --> 10:42.660
There’s a house that was built

10:42.660 --> 10:45.000
on top of an old well,

10:45.000 --> 10:48.130
and it’s very likely
that Sam Bass

10:48.130 --> 10:51.660
could have hid his gold
down in that well.

10:51.660 --> 10:53.260
So, uh, we’re really excited

10:53.260 --> 10:55.130
to check that place out,
as well.

10:55.130 --> 10:57.520
Matty, this
is right up your alley.

10:57.520 --> 10:59.190
(chuckles)
Right up your alley, man.

10:59.190 --> 11:00.520
-I am in.
-MARTY: You guys,

11:00.520 --> 11:01.590
can you put up with Matty Blake

11:01.590 --> 11:02.750
helping you out down there?

11:02.750 --> 11:05.520
Oh, yes.
We-we can’t wait to meet him.

11:05.520 --> 11:06.520
-(chuckles): All right. Perfect.
-Great.

11:06.520 --> 11:09.190
All right. Well, uh,
I’ll coordinate with you ladies

11:09.190 --> 11:11.190
on my trip,
and we’ll see you in Texas.

11:11.190 --> 11:13.390
-GYPSY: Sounds good.
-DONNA: Sounds good to me.
Let’s find

11:13.390 --> 11:15.260
-a pot of gold. Thanks, y’all.
-(Gypsy chuckles)

11:15.260 --> 11:18.390
\h-Thanks for your help.
-See you.
-RICK: Pleasure to meet you.

11:19.000 --> 11:20.260
MARTY:
Sounds exciting.

11:20.260 --> 11:23.330
-You’re all in. (chuckles)
-All in. I mean,

11:23.330 --> 11:24.230
this is exactly
what I love to do.

11:24.230 --> 11:26.720
I love representing the team.
And if there’s something

11:26.720 --> 11:28.390
there to be found,
I think we’ll find it.

11:28.390 --> 11:29.460
Go find it.

11:29.460 --> 11:31.520
Go find that pot of gold.

11:31.520 --> 11:33.490
MATTY:
Yes, sir.

11:36.390 --> 11:38.590
NARRATOR:
Three days after his meeting

11:38.590 --> 11:40.520
with the Lagina brothers
on Oak Island,

11:40.520 --> 11:44.520
Matty Blake has traveled
to Waco, Texas,

11:44.520 --> 11:45.390
to meet up with treasure hunters

11:45.390 --> 11:49.390
Michele "Gypsy Jewels" Woods
and Donna McCauley

11:49.390 --> 11:52.590
at the Texas Ranger
Hall of Fame and Museum.

11:52.590 --> 11:54.130
-GYPSY: Hey.
\h-DONNA: Oh,

11:54.130 --> 11:55.090
-hey, Matty.
-MATTY: (chuckles) D-Donna.

11:55.090 --> 11:57.520
-Hey, Matty. How are you?
-Good to see you in person.

11:57.520 --> 11:59.360
-You, too.
-How are you?
-Glad to finally see you

11:59.360 --> 12:00.230
-in person.
-Good to see you, Gypsy.

12:00.230 --> 12:02.460
DONNA: Uh, this is Mr. Byron.
He’s the director

12:02.460 --> 12:05.000
-of the Texas Museum.
-Very pleased to see you.

12:05.000 --> 12:06.390
-Why don’t we go on back.
-Love to see it.

12:06.390 --> 12:07.390
-Awesome. Let’s go see.
-Yeah, great.

12:07.390 --> 12:11.130
NARRATOR:
The Texas Ranger
Hall of Fame and Museum

12:11.130 --> 12:13.490
is home
to more than 20,000 artifacts,

12:13.490 --> 12:17.330
photos and documents
preserving the legacy

12:17.330 --> 12:20.130
of the premier
state law enforcement agency,

12:20.130 --> 12:22.590
which was founded in 1823.

12:22.590 --> 12:27.000
Here Gypsy and Donna have
arranged to show Matty evidence

12:27.000 --> 12:29.000
that the notorious outlaw
Sam Bass

12:29.000 --> 12:31.720
may have buried
at least $1.5 million

12:31.720 --> 12:35.190
in gold and silver
somewhere in the state

12:35.190 --> 12:37.660
nearly 150 years ago.

12:37.660 --> 12:41.000
Wow. This is a beautiful museum.

12:41.190 --> 12:42.620
BYRON:
This is a painting

12:42.620 --> 12:46.130
of Sam Bass’ shoot-out
in Round Rock.

12:46.130 --> 12:47.750
Sam Bass himself
was kind of interesting.

12:47.750 --> 12:50.590
He was kind of a drifter
and a cowboy

12:50.590 --> 12:52.390
and had a very short career.

12:52.390 --> 12:54.130
He was really known

12:54.130 --> 12:55.460
for two things.

12:55.460 --> 12:56.460
One was

12:56.460 --> 12:58.660
committing one
of the biggest train robberies

12:58.660 --> 13:00.130
in western American history.

13:00.130 --> 13:03.000
And then the second event
he was known for

13:03.000 --> 13:06.130
was dying in a hail of bullets
from Texas Rangers

13:06.130 --> 13:07.490
in Round Rock, Texas,

13:07.490 --> 13:11.490
who had been after him
ever since that train robbery.

13:11.590 --> 13:14.130
NARRATOR:
Following their robbery

13:14.130 --> 13:15.390
of the Union Pacific Railroad

13:15.390 --> 13:20.060
in Big Springs, Nebraska,
on September 18, 1877,

13:20.060 --> 13:23.590
Sam Bass and his cohorts
fled to Texas,

13:23.590 --> 13:26.720
where they carried out
four more train heists

13:26.720 --> 13:28.620
within the next two months.

13:29.260 --> 13:32.090
It was an audacious feat

13:32.090 --> 13:33.230
that no other outlaw

13:33.230 --> 13:36.190
had ever committed
or even attempted.

13:36.190 --> 13:38.490
JAMESON:
After four
successful train robberies,

13:38.490 --> 13:41.130
the railroads got pretty tired
of Sam Bass.

13:41.130 --> 13:45.130
So, the railroads in conjunction
with the Texas Rangers

13:45.130 --> 13:49.130
decided to go after Sam Bass
for real.

13:49.130 --> 13:52.390
MILLER: So, they recruited
30 Rangers temporarily,

13:52.390 --> 13:55.390
and then from then on, it was
just a chase, and he didn’t rob

13:55.390 --> 13:58.590
any more trains because he was
too busy running from the law.

13:58.590 --> 14:00.750
NARRATOR:
The Texas Rangers were unable

14:00.750 --> 14:04.330
to capture Sam Bass
by conventional means,

14:04.330 --> 14:05.660
so in order to stop the man

14:05.660 --> 14:08.490
\hwho was quickly gaining
legendary outlaw status,

14:08.490 --> 14:12.460
they hatched
a highly unconventional plan.

14:12.460 --> 14:14.490
MILLER:
They arrested Henderson Murphy,

14:14.490 --> 14:16.260
who was the father
of Jim Murphy,

14:16.260 --> 14:17.460
who was in the Bass Gang.

14:17.460 --> 14:19.750
Jim Murphy was upset
because his father

14:19.750 --> 14:22.720
was taken into custody,
so he went to the prosecutor

14:22.720 --> 14:25.130
and said, "Look,
if you let my father loose,

14:25.130 --> 14:26.330
I will get you Sam Bass."

14:26.330 --> 14:29.000
NARRATOR:
After Murphy
tipped off the Rangers

14:29.000 --> 14:31.490
that Sam Bass had plans
for his gang

14:31.490 --> 14:33.130
to rob Williamson County Bank

14:33.130 --> 14:38.060
in the city of Round Rock
on July 19, 1878,

14:38.060 --> 14:39.520
four Rangers

14:39.520 --> 14:42.520
along with a local sheriff
named A.W. Grimes

14:42.520 --> 14:46.330
hurried into town
with the intent to set a trap.

14:46.330 --> 14:50.090
MILLER:
Sam Bass and the gang
come into town.

14:50.090 --> 14:51.390
Murphy was afraid

14:51.390 --> 14:53.390
that he was gonna walk
into an ambush and get killed,

14:53.390 --> 14:56.330
so he talked him into
letting him get off in the store

14:56.330 --> 14:58.060
on the way in there
to ask and see

14:58.060 --> 14:59.260
if there’s any Rangers around.

14:59.260 --> 15:01.490
NARRATOR:
Once Jim Murphy left the group,

15:01.490 --> 15:05.390
Bass and his two cohorts,
Seaborn Barnes

15:05.390 --> 15:06.460
and Frank Jackson,

15:06.460 --> 15:09.260
hid their horses in an alley

15:09.260 --> 15:11.060
and headed
for the town’s general store.

15:11.060 --> 15:13.260
As they approached the store,
there were...

15:13.260 --> 15:15.000
there were two deputies there.

15:15.000 --> 15:17.490
One of the deputies
approached Sam Bass

15:17.490 --> 15:19.090
and asked him if he was armed.

15:19.090 --> 15:23.000
And at that point,
the gunfire breaks out.

15:23.620 --> 15:27.130
Grimes was shot five times
and falls dead.

15:27.130 --> 15:29.660
Then the Texas Rangers
open fire,

15:29.660 --> 15:32.360
shoot Bass’ middle finger off.

15:32.360 --> 15:33.330
The three bandits

15:33.330 --> 15:35.260
start down the alley
to get to their horses.

15:35.260 --> 15:37.490
Seaborn Barnes gets down there,
and one of the Rangers

15:37.490 --> 15:40.590
draws aim and puts a bullet
right through his brain,

15:40.590 --> 15:42.720
kills him dead on the spot.

15:42.720 --> 15:45.000
NARRATOR:
During the ensuing gunfire,

15:45.000 --> 15:47.490
Sam Bass was hit
near the base of his spine

15:47.490 --> 15:50.330
and was helped to his horse
by Frank Jackson.

15:50.330 --> 15:54.000
The two men continued
to dodge bullets

15:54.000 --> 15:55.130
as they raced out of town.

15:55.130 --> 15:57.590
Bass can’t ride very much.
He is-he is severely wounded.

15:57.590 --> 16:02.390
So they stop, and, uh, Jackson
leaves him and disappears

16:02.390 --> 16:03.590
into history.

16:03.590 --> 16:05.260
In the morning,
a posse goes out,

16:05.260 --> 16:08.230
and they capture Sam Bass.

16:08.260 --> 16:11.520
It was not long after that
that he passed away.

16:11.520 --> 16:14.520
NARRATOR:
At the time of Sam Bass’ death,

16:14.520 --> 16:18.000
not a single gold coin
was found on him

16:18.000 --> 16:20.460
or in his saddlebags.

16:20.460 --> 16:21.620
To this day,

16:21.620 --> 16:24.660
what happened
to the majority of the treasure

16:24.660 --> 16:27.520
remains a mystery.

16:28.590 --> 16:30.590
BYRON:
Well, now let’s take a look

16:30.590 --> 16:35.260
at the treasure
from the Sam Bass archive here.

16:35.260 --> 16:37.390
NARRATOR:
However, one of the coins,

16:37.390 --> 16:41.330
reportedly spent by Sam Bass
himself in a saloon...

16:41.330 --> 16:42.130
-MATTY: Wow.
-DONNA: Wow.

16:42.130 --> 16:47.000
NARRATOR:
...was donated to the museum
more than 50 years ago.

16:47.000 --> 16:48.060
DONNA:
Oh!

16:48.060 --> 16:48.720
MATTY:
You know, Byron, I think

16:48.720 --> 16:51.190
-I’m gonna let Donna
have the honors.
-(Byron chuckles)

16:51.190 --> 16:52.660
-Oh!
-’Cause she’s been waiting
a long time,

16:52.660 --> 16:55.520
-right, Gypsy?
-GYPSY: She has.

16:55.520 --> 16:57.390
DONNA:
Oh, look at that.

16:57.390 --> 17:00.060
-Sam Bass held this.
-That’s amazing.

17:00.060 --> 17:02.660
BYRON:
Well, we’ll tell you
the story of it.

17:02.660 --> 17:03.590
The train

17:03.590 --> 17:06.330
that Sam Bass knocked over
had a shipment

17:06.330 --> 17:08.360
from the U.S. Mint
in San Francisco

17:08.360 --> 17:10.490
of $20 gold Double Eagles.

17:10.490 --> 17:11.260
They were called Double Eagles

17:11.260 --> 17:14.060
because it was
two times ten dollars,

17:14.060 --> 17:15.590
or $20.

17:15.590 --> 17:18.130
When he found those
on the train,

17:18.130 --> 17:19.390
it became a curse for him

17:19.390 --> 17:22.190
because suddenly,
every lawman in the West

17:22.190 --> 17:24.360
was looking
for San Francisco Mint

17:24.360 --> 17:26.390
-$20 Double Eagles.
-DONNA: Yeah.
-GYPSY: Right.

17:26.390 --> 17:28.130
-MATTY: Got it.
-BYRON: So it was
a real problem.

17:28.130 --> 17:31.330
-There were 3,000 of these.
-MATTY: Mm.

17:31.330 --> 17:35.260
They weighed
in excess of 200 pounds

17:35.260 --> 17:35.660
in 90% gold.

17:35.660 --> 17:39.360
MATTY:
Are we still confident
that there’s enough of these

17:39.360 --> 17:41.620
that may still lie buried
somewhere?

17:41.620 --> 17:44.130
You know, he might have buried
some of them

17:44.130 --> 17:47.090
just to get them
out of circulation for a while.

17:47.090 --> 17:49.660
And we’re gonna find something.
I believe it.

17:49.660 --> 17:51.590
Thank you so much, Byron.
That’s-that’s an honor.

17:51.590 --> 17:53.190
-GYPSY: Thank you.
-It’s our pleasure.

17:53.190 --> 17:54.520
MATTY:
I think it’s time to go find you

17:54.520 --> 17:56.390
-some Sam Bass gold.
What do you think?
-Oh, I do, too.

17:56.390 --> 17:57.520
-Let’s go find it. I’m ready.
-GYPSY: I’m ready.

17:57.520 --> 18:00.090
-Byron, thank you, sir.
-I’m glad to have you here.

18:00.090 --> 18:02.000
MATTY:
Thank you.

18:02.720 --> 18:05.360
NARRATOR:
Later that afternoon...

18:05.360 --> 18:07.330
-MATTY: We’ll start loading up?
-NARRATOR: Matty,

18:07.330 --> 18:09.000
Donna and Gypsy arrive

18:09.000 --> 18:11.360
in the city of Springtown,
where Sam Bass

18:11.360 --> 18:14.720
and his gang established
one of two known hideouts

18:14.720 --> 18:16.520
back in the late 1870s.

18:16.520 --> 18:19.620
That’s everything.
All right, let’s hit the road.

18:19.620 --> 18:21.520
NARRATOR:
A hideout on private land

18:21.520 --> 18:24.130
whose owners
have never allowed a search

18:24.130 --> 18:27.130
with metal detection equipment
until now.

18:27.130 --> 18:28.520
GYPSY:
So, our hopes

18:28.520 --> 18:30.660
when we are
at Sam Bass Springs is

18:30.660 --> 18:34.000
to search around
where they might have camped

18:34.000 --> 18:37.130
and see if there is
any hidden objects

18:37.130 --> 18:39.000
inside the spring.

18:39.000 --> 18:41.190
The thrill of what I do

18:41.190 --> 18:42.660
is what can you discover?

18:42.660 --> 18:45.390
What can you find?
You just never know.

18:45.390 --> 18:47.620
What about this spot
in particular

18:47.620 --> 18:50.360
led you to believe,
A, this is a great hideout

18:50.360 --> 18:51.720
for the gang,
and B, they might have left

18:51.720 --> 18:53.360
-some stuff behind?
-DONNA: Well, you know,

18:53.360 --> 18:55.230
if you... Just picture it.

18:55.230 --> 18:56.460
Back in the 1870s,

18:56.460 --> 18:59.660
that was all covered
with huge trees.

18:59.660 --> 19:01.260
-Really?
-Yeah. Oh, yeah.

19:01.260 --> 19:03.130
And in the mid-1990s,

19:03.130 --> 19:04.520
they had a big fire here.

19:04.520 --> 19:07.130
They lost all their big trees.
So that’s why

19:07.130 --> 19:08.660
the terrain
looks a lot different now.

19:08.660 --> 19:10.260
-Interesting.
-DONNA: Uh-huh.

19:10.260 --> 19:11.260
So, are y’all ready
to start searching?

19:11.260 --> 19:14.260
-Let’s treasure hunt
in Texas, ladies.
-DONNA: Ready?

19:14.260 --> 19:15.460
NARRATOR:
To conduct their search,

19:15.460 --> 19:19.660
Gypsy and Donna are using
Garret ACE Apex metal detectors,

19:19.660 --> 19:23.260
which can identify
both ferrous targets,

19:23.260 --> 19:25.460
such as iron,
and nonferrous targets,

19:25.460 --> 19:27.190
such as silver or gold,

19:27.190 --> 19:29.190
as much as two feet
beneath the ground.

19:29.190 --> 19:30.330
MATTY:
I’m also gonna be scanning
for snakes,

19:30.330 --> 19:34.130
-to be honest.
-Okay, you scan for snakes
and mountain lions.

19:34.130 --> 19:36.360
-I got a signal here.
-You do?

19:36.360 --> 19:37.360
I do.

19:37.360 --> 19:39.590
-(metal detector beeping)
-Oh, yeah.

19:39.590 --> 19:42.000
(sustained beep)

19:42.000 --> 19:43.360
Ooh!

19:44.130 --> 19:45.520
GYPSY:
Okay, Matty,

19:45.520 --> 19:48.230
I’m saying that’s about center,

19:48.230 --> 19:49.390
-so...
-Okay.

19:49.390 --> 19:51.060
Yeah, it’s a little bit
of a different terrain

19:51.060 --> 19:53.060
-than I’m used to, but...
-(Gypsy laughs)

19:53.060 --> 19:56.520
-It’s not Oak Island?
-Not quite.

19:56.660 --> 19:58.260
-Nice plug.
-MATTY: Thank you.

19:58.260 --> 19:59.620
-(beeping)
-DONNA: Oh, it’s right here.

19:59.620 --> 20:01.660
-GYPSY: Right there.
-MATTY: Wow.

20:02.000 --> 20:04.090
-Find something good.
-Is that it?

20:04.090 --> 20:07.360
-Oh, my God.
-GYPSY: What is it?

20:07.390 --> 20:09.330
MATTY:
Oh, my God. Look at that.

20:09.330 --> 20:10.390
GYPSY:
Are you serious?

20:13.130 --> 20:16.000
-GYPSY: Are you serious?
-DONNA: I think it’s a coin.

20:16.000 --> 20:18.750
Do we have some water
or something?

20:19.720 --> 20:23.000
-Oh, my God, look at that.
-GYPSY: What is it?

20:23.000 --> 20:24.520
MATTY:
It’s so smooth it feels like,

20:24.520 --> 20:26.390
uh, almost-almost...
looks decorative.

20:26.390 --> 20:29.260
-It’s got a little green patina
there, too.
-Oh, yeah, a patina.

20:29.260 --> 20:30.260
It’s got patina, yeah.

20:30.260 --> 20:32.060
-Uh, hit that side again
one more time.
-Yeah.

20:32.060 --> 20:35.520
NARRATOR: Near Springtown,
Texas, at a hilltop location

20:35.520 --> 20:37.330
known as Sam Bass Springs,

20:37.330 --> 20:41.330
Matty Blake, along with treasure
hunters Donna McCauley

20:41.330 --> 20:43.260
and Michelle
"Gypsy Jewels" Woods,

20:43.260 --> 20:46.660
have just made what could be
an important discovery.

20:46.660 --> 20:51.330
GYPSY:
Now, what this could be is...
it came off of a saddle.

20:51.330 --> 20:53.520
Does this look like
it’s of the period to you?

20:53.520 --> 20:55.260
I think that’s from the 1800s.

20:55.260 --> 20:58.000
-You do?
-With the green patina,
it could be.

20:58.000 --> 21:01.000
MATTY:
Wow. So this could be

21:01.000 --> 21:04.000
your first piece of evidence
that they were here.

21:04.000 --> 21:08.130
-That they were here.
-That Sam Bass’ gang was here.

21:08.130 --> 21:10.190
Man. I’m happy.

21:10.190 --> 21:11.360
\h-(Gypsy laughs)
-DONNA: Me, too.

21:11.360 --> 21:12.660
-I’m happy.
-I’m so happy, too.

21:12.660 --> 21:14.590
-You hit it right there,
I mean...
-(whoops)

21:14.590 --> 21:16.590
GYPSY:
Well, let’s-let’s put
that in the pouch

21:16.590 --> 21:20.190
-Okay.
-and let’s, uh, keep going.

21:20.190 --> 21:21.590
Fantastic.

21:21.590 --> 21:23.260
-GYPSY: So I’m just curious...
-DONNA: Go straight up.

21:23.260 --> 21:27.260
if-if up the hill,
right up there above that ridge,

21:27.260 --> 21:29.260
if they might have camped there
and went up there

21:29.260 --> 21:31.390
-for lookout, so...
-MATTY: Let’s go.

21:33.660 --> 21:37.000
GYPSY:
Now, we definitely want to check
around these rocks

21:37.000 --> 21:38.460
just in case they dug
a little hole

21:38.460 --> 21:41.660
and rolled the rock right
on top of the treasure, so...

21:41.660 --> 21:43.390
MATTY:
Got it.

21:43.390 --> 21:44.750
-(beeping)
-You like that?

21:44.750 --> 21:46.460
GYPSY:
I’ve got a hit right here.

21:46.460 --> 21:48.750
-Center right there?
-Right there.

21:51.260 --> 21:53.390
Man, I don’t have to go
to the gym today.

21:53.390 --> 21:55.130
GYPSY:
Right? You’re getting
your workout.

21:55.130 --> 21:57.060
MATTY:
Yes, ma’am.

21:57.060 --> 21:59.130
(Matty grunts)

22:00.660 --> 22:01.190
Whoa!

22:01.190 --> 22:04.060
-GYPSY: What is it?
-Look at the size of that.

22:04.060 --> 22:04.520
GYPSY:
Wow.

22:04.520 --> 22:06.260
-DONNA: What is it?
-That looks like

22:06.260 --> 22:09.260
it was part of a-a shovel.

22:09.260 --> 22:11.460
-DONNA: Yeah.
-This would have been

22:11.460 --> 22:16.260
part of the, uh,
bottom piece of the shovel,

22:16.260 --> 22:17.390
but this is old.

22:17.390 --> 22:20.000
Look at the rivets
on that thing.

22:20.000 --> 22:22.260
They look hand-forged.

22:22.260 --> 22:24.520
-DONNA: Wow.
-My goodness.

22:24.520 --> 22:26.000
Do you think that’s period?

22:26.000 --> 22:27.390
-I do. I do.
-DONNA: I do.

22:27.390 --> 22:31.390
And they could have used
this shovel to bury their gold.

22:32.130 --> 22:34.260
I mean, they do not make shovels
like that anymore.

22:34.260 --> 22:37.460
No. If these finds date
where you guys think they do...

22:37.460 --> 22:40.460
-Mm-hmm.
-it’s kind of
irrefutable evidence

22:40.460 --> 22:45.330
that at least someone in
Sam Bass’ time frame was here,

22:45.330 --> 22:46.130
-Mm-hmm.
-which is huge.

22:46.130 --> 22:50.260
-Sam Bass could have used
this very shovel.
-(chuckles): Yeah.

22:50.260 --> 22:51.520
GYPSY:
I’m getting chills. Are you?

22:51.520 --> 22:52.460
DONNA:
That’s what I’m thinking.

22:52.460 --> 22:55.590
All right, I think we’ve
covered this area pretty well.

22:55.590 --> 22:57.260
\h-Pretty thorough.
-DONNA: I do, too.

22:57.260 --> 22:58.660
What do y’all say
we go to the spring?

22:58.660 --> 23:00.590
-DONNA: I agree. Let’s go.
-Let’s go.

23:00.590 --> 23:04.460
NARRATOR:
After finding what could be
two valuable clues

23:04.460 --> 23:07.590
related to the outlaw Sam Bass
and his gang,

23:07.590 --> 23:10.660
\hGypsy and Donna are now
focusing their attention

23:10.660 --> 23:14.590
on a freshwater spring
also located on the property.

23:14.590 --> 23:17.260
-Do you see that tin top
right there?
-Oh, wow. Yeah.

23:17.260 --> 23:18.130
-Yeah.
-Yeah, there it is.

23:18.130 --> 23:21.750
NARRATOR:
Although covered today
with heavy metal doors,

23:21.750 --> 23:24.260
based on her extensive research
and interviews

23:24.260 --> 23:27.330
with local residents,
it is Donna’s suspicion

23:27.330 --> 23:30.090
that the Sam Bass gang
may have used this spring

23:30.090 --> 23:34.260
for more than a fresh
water source for their horses.

23:34.260 --> 23:35.660
Oh, wow.

23:35.660 --> 23:38.130
Look at this, huh?

23:38.130 --> 23:40.130
Now, so, this is the spring?

23:40.130 --> 23:43.260
-GYPSY: This is the spring.
Sam Bass Spring.
-Wow.

23:43.260 --> 23:47.190
What’s your theory
as to what might be in here?

23:47.190 --> 23:50.190
They’re collecting water, right?
They’re camping around this.

23:50.190 --> 23:51.720
You think maybe they dropped
something in here

23:51.720 --> 23:53.520
or maybe actually hid
something in the water?

23:53.520 --> 23:56.130
-I think they could’ve.
-I think of both.

23:56.130 --> 23:58.130
All right, but before I open it,

23:58.130 --> 23:59.720
-this looks like...
-(soft laughter)

23:59.720 --> 24:01.590
...it could be, like,
snake heaven in here.

24:01.590 --> 24:02.390
GYPSY:
Snake heaven.

24:02.390 --> 24:04.660
That’s exactly what
I was thinking.

24:05.390 --> 24:07.130
Hey, fellas?

24:07.130 --> 24:08.590
We’re coming in.

24:10.360 --> 24:11.390
(grunts)

24:11.390 --> 24:13.720
-Wow. You know what, though...?
-GYPSY: A lot of leaves.

24:13.720 --> 24:16.520
-It’s actually pretty clear.
-MATTY: It’s really clear.

24:16.520 --> 24:17.390
GYPSY:
So Matty, you know,

24:17.390 --> 24:19.720
I think I’m gonna go ahead
and put my waders on

24:19.720 --> 24:22.130
-and I’m gonna get in.
\h-That’s a great idea.

24:22.130 --> 24:25.390
NARRATOR:
In order to search for any clues

24:25.390 --> 24:28.000
or potential valuables
in the spring...

24:28.000 --> 24:29.520
-I got you.
-Whoa.

24:29.520 --> 24:30.260
NARRATOR:
...Gypsy is using

24:30.260 --> 24:33.260
the Garrett Max
underwater metal detector,

24:33.260 --> 24:36.190
which is also capable
of detecting metal objects

24:36.190 --> 24:40.060
buried as much
as three feet underground.

24:40.060 --> 24:41.720
(beeping)

24:43.260 --> 24:45.660
GYPSY:
There’s definitely metal
in here.

24:45.660 --> 24:48.460
But I’m thinking it’s from this.

24:48.520 --> 24:50.390
Where I really want to get...

24:50.390 --> 24:52.260
-Under there.
-is up under that ridge.
-Yeah.

24:52.260 --> 24:53.000
MATTY:
\hOkay.

24:53.000 --> 24:55.390
DONNA:
Ooh, that looks deeper
up under there.

24:55.390 --> 24:59.190
-Look how deep that’s going.
-You see that?

24:59.190 --> 25:01.090
Look at that.

25:01.090 --> 25:02.460
-DONNA: You hitting?
-MATTY: Wow.

25:02.460 --> 25:05.330
-GYPSY: It even jumped up to 90.
-MATTY: Wow.

25:05.330 --> 25:09.720
GYPSY:
We’re really looking for those
high-number targets.

25:09.720 --> 25:14.000
Anything from high 70s
all the way up to 90s,

25:14.000 --> 25:15.130
because that could indicate

25:15.130 --> 25:18.460
that there is a larger target
deep below.

25:18.460 --> 25:20.590
DONNA:
You want the shovel?

25:20.590 --> 25:21.390
-Uh, not yet.
-Okay.

25:21.390 --> 25:25.230
Let me see if I can get it
with the pinpointer.

25:28.000 --> 25:30.260
\hI am not getting it
with the pinpointer,

25:30.260 --> 25:31.520
-so it must be deeper.
-MATTY: Huh.

25:31.520 --> 25:33.060
DONNA:
You want the shovel?

25:33.060 --> 25:35.590
Um, yeah.

25:35.590 --> 25:37.390
Let’s try it.

25:37.720 --> 25:38.520
-All right.
-All right.

25:38.520 --> 25:41.520
Let me dig this out a little
and then we’ll hit it

25:41.520 --> 25:43.390
-with the pinpointer again.
-Love it.

25:43.390 --> 25:45.190
MATTY:
You have an idea

25:45.190 --> 25:47.190
-where that detector hit, right?
-Yeah.

25:47.190 --> 25:48.330
Let’s get the pinpointer.

25:48.330 --> 25:50.260
All right, so you’ve dug a hole.

25:50.260 --> 25:53.460
You’ve dug a hole,
let’s see if you can get it now.

25:53.460 --> 25:55.090
(beeping)

25:57.190 --> 26:00.330
-Watch that barbed wire
right on your head.
-GYPSY: All right.

26:00.330 --> 26:05.060
Well, guys, I am still not
getting it with the pinpointer.

26:05.060 --> 26:07.460
-It’s deep.
-MATTY: Phantom target?

26:07.460 --> 26:10.060
-Or deep target?
-It could be deep.

26:10.060 --> 26:12.000
Y’all, we’re gonna have to come
back to this another time.

26:12.000 --> 26:15.060
There’s too much water down in
there for us to get up in that.

26:15.060 --> 26:18.520
’Cause I guarantee you
that goes back up in there.

26:18.520 --> 26:20.660
I think that’s your best bet.
Come back here with a pump,

26:20.660 --> 26:23.000
clear this thing out
and dig safely.

26:23.000 --> 26:24.390
-I think you’re right.
-DONNA: I agree.

26:24.390 --> 26:28.130
NARRATOR:
Although Matty, Gypsy and Donna

26:28.130 --> 26:30.260
may be just a few feet
from uncovering

26:30.260 --> 26:33.660
a potentially historic
and valuable discovery,

26:33.660 --> 26:37.390
because of the large boulders,
they will have to arrange

26:37.390 --> 26:39.520
for heavy equipment
to be brought in

26:39.520 --> 26:43.130
before they can continue
investigating the spring.

26:43.130 --> 26:44.060
MATTY:
All right, we got you.

26:44.060 --> 26:46.390
NARRATOR:
Unfortunately,

26:46.390 --> 26:47.520
even on private land,

26:47.520 --> 26:49.190
this will require
a government permit,

26:49.190 --> 26:53.260
which could take several days
or weeks to obtain.

26:53.260 --> 26:57.260
However, they still have
another location to investigate.

26:57.260 --> 27:01.590
One where eyewitnesses actually
claim to have seen Sam Bass

27:01.590 --> 27:03.720
hide some
of his stolen treasure.

27:03.720 --> 27:06.000
MATTY:
We want to get to another site
if we can.

27:06.000 --> 27:07.330
DONNA:
Yeah, let’s load up and go.

27:07.330 --> 27:09.090
MATTY:
Let’s get out
of this Texas heat.

27:09.090 --> 27:11.520
GYPSY:
\hYeah.

27:15.000 --> 27:18.000
MATTY: Let’s talk about the site
we’re going to right now.
-(beeping)

27:18.000 --> 27:19.520
We’re gonna be going
to East Mountain.

27:19.520 --> 27:21.660
-Okay.
-And we’re have to go up on a,

27:21.660 --> 27:25.060
you know, a pretty steep hill...
Well, it’s a mountain.

27:25.060 --> 27:27.520
There’s rattlers
over there, definitely.

27:27.520 --> 27:31.520
So we got to be
real careful on that.

27:31.520 --> 27:33.520
Awesome.

27:34.190 --> 27:36.260
NARRATOR:
In Mineral Wells, Texas,

27:36.260 --> 27:39.660
Matty Blake, along with treasure
hunters Donna McCauley

27:39.660 --> 27:43.000
and Michelle "Gypsy Jewels"
Woods are on their way

27:43.000 --> 27:46.390
to investigate a property known
as East Mountain.

27:46.390 --> 27:49.000
According to Donna’s
archival research

27:49.000 --> 27:51.520
and 19th-century
newspaper accounts,

27:51.520 --> 27:54.460
this area was also used
as a hideout

27:54.460 --> 27:58.390
by the notorious outlaw
Sam Bass.

27:58.390 --> 27:59.660
MATTY:
We made it.

27:59.660 --> 28:02.390
East Mountain,
in Sam Bass’ time,

28:02.390 --> 28:04.130
was a bit of a haven
for outlaws,

28:04.130 --> 28:06.390
and kind of a Wild West
type of place.

28:06.390 --> 28:11.190
Shoot-outs,
just typical Wild West tales.

28:11.190 --> 28:13.390
SONNY:
Hello, I’m Sonny.
How are you doing?

28:13.390 --> 28:15.660
Sonny, I want to introduce you
to Matty.

28:15.660 --> 28:17.590
-Hey, Sonny. Matty Blake.
-Hello. Nice to meet you.

28:17.590 --> 28:20.060
NARRATOR:
Local businessman Sonny Estes

28:20.060 --> 28:22.260
is the current owner
of the property.

28:22.260 --> 28:24.390
Sonny’s home,
known as Hill House,

28:24.390 --> 28:27.260
may also be hiding
important or valuable clues

28:27.260 --> 28:31.330
due to the fact that it was
built on top of an old well

28:31.330 --> 28:35.130
that Sam Bass is also reported
to have used.

28:35.130 --> 28:38.390
Thanks in part to Donna
and Gypsy’s cooperation

28:38.390 --> 28:40.060
with Rick and Marty Lagina,

28:40.060 --> 28:42.660
Sonny has agreed to allow
his home to be searched

28:42.660 --> 28:46.660
for the first time ever
with metal-detecting equipment.

28:46.660 --> 28:49.000
So, Sonny, obviously,
this house of yours

28:49.000 --> 28:51.660
has a lot of history,
a lot of lore.

28:51.660 --> 28:53.090
It’s very notorious,

28:53.090 --> 28:55.000
but how about as far
as legend of Sam Bass

28:55.000 --> 28:56.460
being right here
on the hill behind it?

28:56.460 --> 28:58.000
Have you heard
anything like that?

28:58.000 --> 28:59.720
SONNY:
We found stuff in newspapers,

28:59.720 --> 29:01.590
and then also
in the history books about...

29:01.590 --> 29:06.130
they talk about him burying
half of his stash up there

29:06.130 --> 29:09.660
before he headed to Round Rock,
I believe, is what I’ve read.

29:09.660 --> 29:11.520
Yeah, you know, Indian Joe--
he’s the one

29:11.520 --> 29:14.660
that witnessed Sam Bass,
you know, putting that gold

29:14.660 --> 29:17.390
-down in a well.
-Wow.

29:18.060 --> 29:20.260
NARRATOR:
In November of 1938,

29:20.260 --> 29:25.330
\hcivil engineer William R. Jones
became the first treasure hunter

29:25.330 --> 29:27.660
to conduct a search
of this East Mountain property

29:27.660 --> 29:32.520
after reading the account of
a local man known as Indian Joe

29:32.520 --> 29:35.390
that was published
in the Austin American.

29:35.390 --> 29:39.520
According to his testimony,
Joe personally watched

29:39.520 --> 29:42.000
as Sam Bass
and several associates

29:42.000 --> 29:45.330
buried an estimated
$80,000 in gold coins

29:45.330 --> 29:48.060
somewhere on East Mountain,

29:48.060 --> 29:53.130
a sum that would be worth
more than $2.2 million today.

29:53.130 --> 29:56.520
Armed with an electronic
water pipe detector,

29:56.520 --> 30:00.520
Jones spent more than a week
searching the mountain,

30:00.520 --> 30:02.750
but left empty-handed.

30:02.750 --> 30:05.000
Well, Sonny,
thanks for letting us do this.

30:05.000 --> 30:08.390
I think our plan is to get
up there, search for a while.

30:08.390 --> 30:10.390
And then, I would actually love
to get in the house

30:10.390 --> 30:13.520
and maybe see this well that
you guys have told me about,

30:13.520 --> 30:14.520
if that’s possible.

30:14.520 --> 30:16.000
SONNY:
Okay. Y’all ready to go?

30:16.000 --> 30:17.660
-MATTY: Yeah, right up there?
-Okay, yeah, we’ll just...

30:17.660 --> 30:19.660
-let’s go this way.
-Let’s go hunting.

30:19.660 --> 30:21.130
MATTY:
The search plan today

30:21.130 --> 30:24.130
is to make our way
\hup East Mountain.

30:24.130 --> 30:25.060
It’s pretty treacherous terrain,

30:25.060 --> 30:26.590
so we’re gonna have
to be careful.

30:26.590 --> 30:28.260
It’s getting steep,
so be careful.

30:28.260 --> 30:28.720
DONNA:
\hOkay.

30:28.720 --> 30:31.260
MATTY:
The heat and humidity is brutal.

30:31.260 --> 30:33.520
We’re gonna let
Donna and Gypsy worry

30:33.520 --> 30:34.660
about searching for treasure,

30:34.660 --> 30:37.000
and I’m gonna keep my eyes out
for snakes,

30:37.000 --> 30:39.520
any potential dangers,
make as much noise as I can.

30:39.520 --> 30:42.390
\h\h\h\h-Donna, this way?
-DONNA: Yes, go that way,
\h\h\h\hup to the right.

30:42.390 --> 30:44.190
MATTY:
\hOkay.

30:48.000 --> 30:48.660
GYPSY:
Well, you know, Matty,

30:48.660 --> 30:52.130
if you look around,
we are seeing bigger stones now,

30:52.130 --> 30:54.520
and now, I think
this would be a great hideout.

30:54.520 --> 30:56.190
MATTY:
I think you’re exactly right.

30:56.190 --> 30:57.590
Let’s fire up the detectors
and let’s do it.

30:57.590 --> 30:59.520
-DONNA: Okay.
-All right.

31:00.520 --> 31:01.260
DONNA:
Be careful.

31:01.260 --> 31:03.590
MATTY:
Gypsy, I’m-I’m right
behind you, buddy.

31:03.590 --> 31:05.190
GYPSY:
All right.

31:05.190 --> 31:06.390
(beeping)

31:13.260 --> 31:15.460
GYPSY:
I’m not getting anything.

31:21.190 --> 31:22.720
(beeping)

31:22.720 --> 31:23.330
(steady beep)

31:23.330 --> 31:27.460
(laughs)
Donna, Matty! I got a hit.

31:27.460 --> 31:29.390
-Oh. Let’s do it.
-Let’s do that.

31:29.390 --> 31:31.460
It’s hitting a 78, 79.

31:31.460 --> 31:32.660
MATTY:
Where’s the center? About here?

31:32.660 --> 31:35.190
-GYPSY: Right about there.
-Okay.

31:35.190 --> 31:37.660
Oh, it’s loose soil.

31:41.000 --> 31:42.520
First plug’s coming out.

31:42.520 --> 31:44.390
GYPSY:
All right.

31:45.190 --> 31:47.660
(beeping)

31:47.660 --> 31:49.660
All right. First plug’s out.

31:49.660 --> 31:53.260
Oh, I got it. Oh, whoa.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

31:53.260 --> 31:55.390
-What is it?
-A coin.
-That’s-that’s...

31:55.390 --> 31:57.720
MATTY:
It’s in the shape of a coin.
Hold on.

31:57.720 --> 31:59.130
Could be a button.

31:59.130 --> 32:01.750
Yeah, that’s a... that’s a coin.

32:01.750 --> 32:05.460
I think I see some copper color
underneath all the dirt.

32:05.460 --> 32:08.460
So you might be right,
it might be a penny, but...

32:08.460 --> 32:10.390
it looks stripped-down.

32:10.390 --> 32:12.130
Do you mind if I take
a look at it?

32:12.130 --> 32:13.520
MATTY:
Please. You found it.

32:13.520 --> 32:15.230
GYPSY:
So my eyes can see.

32:15.230 --> 32:17.260
I think it’s just
gonna be a penny.

32:17.260 --> 32:21.000
Could that be from the time
of Sam Bass or no?

32:21.520 --> 32:23.330
GYPSY:
Unfortunately, I don’t think

32:23.330 --> 32:25.130
it’s what we’re looking for.

32:25.520 --> 32:30.090
I think I see Abe Lincoln
on there. (laughs)

32:30.130 --> 32:33.390
MATTY:
So that’d make it
way past the time of...

32:33.390 --> 32:35.060
-Right. It would be, uh...
-Sam Bass.

32:35.060 --> 32:41.000
Probably earliest it could be
is probably around 1909,

32:41.000 --> 32:42.460
if memory serves me correctly.

32:42.460 --> 32:44.520
All right, guys, we’ve been
searching for a while.

32:44.520 --> 32:46.190
I think it’s time
to head back down the hill

32:46.190 --> 32:47.000
and check out that dry well.

32:47.000 --> 32:49.260
-I agree.
-Sounds like a plan.

32:49.260 --> 32:50.460
-All right.
-All right.

32:50.460 --> 32:51.660
MATTY:
We’ve completed our search
on East Mountain,

32:51.660 --> 32:55.660
and now we’re going back to the
Hill House to search that well.

32:55.660 --> 32:58.390
During the time of Sam Bass,
the house wasn’t there.

32:58.390 --> 33:00.260
But there was a well
that they would have used

33:00.260 --> 33:03.520
for a water source
as they hid on East Mountain.

33:03.520 --> 33:05.660
Years later,
this house was built.

33:05.660 --> 33:07.590
So we’re gonna search that well.

33:07.590 --> 33:12.090
SONNY:
All right, just this way, guys.

33:12.090 --> 33:15.330
The well that we have uncovered
is right here.

33:15.330 --> 33:16.000
MATTY:
Wow.

33:16.000 --> 33:18.260
All right, let’s take a look.
So, can I-can I just move these

33:18.260 --> 33:20.260
-out of the way?
Is that all right?
-Yes.

33:20.260 --> 33:22.260
Okay.

33:22.260 --> 33:24.520
Oh, man.

33:31.260 --> 33:33.130
(grunts softly)

33:33.130 --> 33:34.190
(strains):
\hOh, yeah.

33:34.190 --> 33:35.520
What do you see, Matty?

33:35.520 --> 33:37.090
MATTY:
Oh, my God.

33:37.090 --> 33:39.090
Look at all that.

33:43.330 --> 33:44.390
-MATTY: It’s definitely rounded.
-GYPSY: Oh, wow.

33:44.390 --> 33:45.330
Be very careful. It’s very tiny.

33:45.330 --> 33:47.330
-DONNA: Does it look
\h\h\h\hlike a well?
-MATTY: It sure does.

33:47.330 --> 33:50.620
-Oh, awesome.
-NARRATOR: At the historic
Hill House

33:50.620 --> 33:53.390
in Mineral Wells, Texas,
Matty Blake,

33:53.390 --> 33:57.620
along with treasure hunters
Donna McCauley and Gypsy Jewels,

33:57.620 --> 34:01.060
have just uncovered an old well
where some believe

34:01.060 --> 34:04.660
the outlaw Sam Bass may have
\hstashed millions of dollars

34:04.660 --> 34:08.520
in gold coins
more than a century ago.

34:08.520 --> 34:10.620
MATTY:
Definitely crude,

34:10.620 --> 34:13.230
stones are definitely placed.

34:13.230 --> 34:13.720
GYPSY:
\hOkay.

34:13.720 --> 34:16.660
MATTY:
Looks like it’s been here
a long while.

34:16.660 --> 34:19.460
-Hold on.
-GYPSY: What do you see?

34:19.460 --> 34:22.460
MATTY:
You know, there’s a space,
a little hole

34:22.460 --> 34:24.620
right here on the left
of the well.

34:24.620 --> 34:26.060
-GYPSY: Really?
-Yeah.

34:26.060 --> 34:26.660
MATTY:
And it looks to be, like,

34:26.660 --> 34:28.520
there’s another little chamber
in there.

34:28.520 --> 34:29.520
-GYPSY: Really?
-DONNA: Oh...
-Yeah.

34:29.520 --> 34:33.090
Do you think we could get that
snake camera in through there?

34:33.090 --> 34:34.330
MATTY:
Oh, definitely,
it’s the perfect size for it.

34:34.330 --> 34:36.490
I mean, it’s-it’s literally,
like, that big of a hole.

34:36.490 --> 34:40.660
-Oh, wow.
-But the space that it leads to
is... looks like a little room.

34:40.660 --> 34:43.360
It-it seems to run
all the way down there

34:43.360 --> 34:45.260
underneath this floor
to the old part of the house.

34:45.260 --> 34:47.190
It looks like a little void,
you know?

34:47.190 --> 34:48.130
\hI definitely want
to check that out.

34:48.130 --> 34:51.000
That sounds good.
Let’s get the camera.

34:51.000 --> 34:51.390
Cool.

34:51.390 --> 34:56.130
NARRATOR:
In order to search the confined
space of the abandoned well,

34:56.130 --> 34:59.330
Matty has brought
an Anysun borescope camera,

34:59.330 --> 35:02.190
capable of recording
high definition footage

35:02.190 --> 35:05.260
as far as 100 feet underground.

35:05.260 --> 35:07.260
GYPSY:
Let’s get this hooked up,
and Matty,

35:07.260 --> 35:09.390
if you could feed it
through the hole.

35:09.390 --> 35:10.130
MATTY:
You got it.

35:10.130 --> 35:12.660
The fact that there’s
a crawl space, basically,

35:12.660 --> 35:16.130
hidden for hundreds of years
by this house,

35:16.130 --> 35:17.720
who knows what could be there?

35:17.720 --> 35:21.000
All right,
let’s take it slow now.

35:21.000 --> 35:23.130
All right, here it goes.

35:23.130 --> 35:25.130
I’m gonna go very slow.

35:26.520 --> 35:28.360
We’re in this void.

35:28.360 --> 35:31.260
Tell me if you want me to go
in a certain direction.

35:31.260 --> 35:34.390
-Although I can’t, really.
-DONNA: You know, you’re...

35:35.190 --> 35:37.000
It’s tough, maneuvering.

35:37.000 --> 35:39.490
DONNA:
What is that? It’s colorful.

35:39.490 --> 35:41.660
What is that red?

35:41.660 --> 35:42.390
GYPSY:
Yeah I see that.

35:42.390 --> 35:44.520
It almost looks like a cloth
or something blue

35:44.520 --> 35:46.330
-right there as well.
-DONNA: Uh-huh.
-MATTY: Wow.

35:46.330 --> 35:47.390
DONNA:
Could it be a bag?

35:47.390 --> 35:49.130
It almost looks
like a white bag.

35:49.130 --> 35:51.360
MATTY:
Yeah, it’s frustrating
’cause I can see

35:51.360 --> 35:53.390
right now, with the light
of the camera,

35:53.390 --> 35:55.260
what you guys saw,
is like a little pile of...

35:55.260 --> 35:57.460
it almost does look like
a folded-up paper or something.

35:57.460 --> 35:59.390
I just want to reach in
and grab it, but... (chuckles)

35:59.390 --> 36:02.000
you can’t,
it’s too small of a hole and...

36:02.000 --> 36:04.190
What is that shiny stuff
down in there?

36:04.190 --> 36:05.660
-MATTY: You see something shiny?
-Uh-huh.

36:05.660 --> 36:08.360
DONNA:
This almost looks
like a yellow.

36:08.360 --> 36:09.460
Well, gold’s yellow.

36:09.460 --> 36:12.260
MATTY:
Let me see. I’m gonna try
to leave it right there.

36:12.260 --> 36:13.590
DONNA:
Right here. Right...

36:13.590 --> 36:16.130
Go down a little bit
and it’s right up here.

36:16.130 --> 36:17.520
-MATTY: Oh, yeah.
-What is that?

36:17.520 --> 36:20.390
MATTY:
There’s some sort of
metallic piece here,

36:20.390 --> 36:23.330
but then there’s a perfectly
\hround piece right under it.

36:23.330 --> 36:25.390
It almost looks like a coin.

36:25.390 --> 36:26.460
GYPSY:
Wow.

36:26.460 --> 36:30.130
What we could do
is I could crawl in there

36:30.130 --> 36:31.720
and investigate
with the pinpointer.

36:31.720 --> 36:34.750
Let’s go for it.
If you’re willing to do it.

36:34.750 --> 36:37.330
Be very careful, it’s very tiny.

36:37.330 --> 36:39.490
This girl will go anywhere.

36:39.490 --> 36:41.750
Oh, man.

36:42.390 --> 36:44.520
-All right.
-GYPSY: Okay.

36:44.520 --> 36:46.130
Be careful.

36:46.130 --> 36:49.090
GYPSY:
There’s not much space here.

36:49.090 --> 36:51.330
Do you mind handing
that flashlight to me?

36:51.330 --> 36:53.230
-Yeah.
-And what I’m gonna do
is I’m gonna

36:53.230 --> 36:56.490
probe around
with the pinpointer in here...

36:56.490 --> 36:59.130
-Got it.
-and just see if I get any hits.

36:59.130 --> 37:00.660
Got it.

37:07.330 --> 37:08.750
(beeping)

37:08.750 --> 37:10.060
Do you hear that?

37:10.060 --> 37:10.590
-I hear it.
-Yes.

37:10.590 --> 37:12.750
That sounds like
a good hit, Matty.

37:12.750 --> 37:14.390
Sure does.

37:15.390 --> 37:18.520
GYPSY:
I think I’m right on it. Mm.

37:18.520 --> 37:20.130
I don’t like that tone.

37:20.130 --> 37:21.130
GYPSY:
I think I see it.

37:21.130 --> 37:23.590
DONNA:
Ooh, I wonder what it is.

37:23.590 --> 37:25.390
GYPSY:
It feels kind of heavy.

37:25.390 --> 37:27.000
What is it?

37:28.660 --> 37:32.000
MATTY:
Oh, wow, this is cool.

37:34.520 --> 37:36.260
That’s a little piece of metal
of some kind.

37:36.260 --> 37:38.130
-GYPSY: Do you feel
how thick it is?
-It is heavy.

37:38.130 --> 37:40.260
-But it does look
like it could be iron.
-Yeah.

37:40.260 --> 37:42.720
MATTY: It almost looks
like the very top

37:42.720 --> 37:45.130
of a hand-hewn nail.

37:45.130 --> 37:47.520
-Like the head snapped off.
-DONNA: Oh.

37:47.520 --> 37:50.000
-Oh, well, that would be old.
-Yep.

37:50.000 --> 37:51.720
MATTY:
The fact that Gypsy had found
some metal

37:51.720 --> 37:54.620
\hin this very old well
is pretty interesting.

37:54.620 --> 37:57.190
It definitely looks period.
It looks old.

37:57.190 --> 37:58.620
They may have buried
treasure there.

37:58.620 --> 38:01.660
Uh, but right now,
I just don’t know.

38:01.660 --> 38:02.660
GYPSY:
All right, guys,

38:02.660 --> 38:05.520
there is not that much space
to explore in here

38:05.520 --> 38:06.660
until this is dug out further.

38:06.660 --> 38:10.360
So, we will leave
the rest of the exploration

38:10.360 --> 38:11.360
for another time.

38:11.360 --> 38:13.520
But, uh, I think I’m ready
to climb out of this hole.

38:13.520 --> 38:16.260
-(laughter)
-Yeah.
-DONNA: I think so, too.

38:16.260 --> 38:17.490
-Good job.
\h-(whoops)

38:17.490 --> 38:20.190
-Ooh, you’re dirty.
-MATTY (chuckles): Man.

38:20.190 --> 38:21.130
GYPSY:
Y’all ready to get out of here?

38:21.130 --> 38:23.130
-Let’s pack up and go.
-Let’s do it.

38:23.130 --> 38:26.060
This is a situation
tech must be applied.

38:26.060 --> 38:28.460
You have to run a scan,
you have to get some sort

38:28.460 --> 38:30.330
of detecting equipment
down there,

38:30.330 --> 38:32.060
and then you come up
with a target.

38:32.060 --> 38:35.360
And then you’re gonna have
to start pulling boards and dig,

38:35.360 --> 38:37.000
if you want to find anything.

38:37.000 --> 38:40.060
But I’ve got stuff
to show Rick and Marty.

38:40.060 --> 38:41.390
If you get some science up here,

38:41.390 --> 38:42.330
if you get the proper tech
up here,

38:42.330 --> 38:46.460
I am convinced that Gypsy
and Donna will find something.

38:46.460 --> 38:48.260
-(exhales)
-Oh, that was fun.

38:48.260 --> 38:51.230
So, this has been
an unbelievable journey,

38:51.230 --> 38:53.660
-and I hope you keep going.
-Oh, we will.

38:53.660 --> 38:56.130
We are coming back
for this area, too,

38:56.130 --> 38:58.060
for this and the well.

38:58.060 --> 39:00.090
Yeah, I’d love to see you guys
get some tech

39:00.090 --> 39:00.520
up on that mountain.

39:00.520 --> 39:03.720
Because I do think you have
a great hot spot there.

39:03.720 --> 39:06.360
We will be finding
Sam Bass’ gold.

39:06.360 --> 39:07.490
(laughs)

39:07.490 --> 39:10.190
-I just can’t stop.
-I love it.

39:10.190 --> 39:11.390
-One more time?
-Uh-huh.

39:11.390 --> 39:13.360
(laughter)

39:18.260 --> 39:20.090
NARRATOR:
One week after searching

39:20.090 --> 39:21.360
for Sam Bass’ buried loot--

39:21.360 --> 39:26.190
\hgold coins said to be worth
nearly six million dollars--

39:26.190 --> 39:28.390
Matty Blake has returned
to Oak Island

39:28.390 --> 39:30.360
to give brothers
Rick and Marty Lagina

39:30.360 --> 39:33.360
a full report
on the Texas treasure hunt.

39:33.360 --> 39:36.000
It looks like a shovel,
but the spade of the shovel

39:36.000 --> 39:37.090
would be here, right?

39:37.090 --> 39:39.520
And then this would be
the handle, the wooden handle.

39:39.520 --> 39:41.190
And there’s your rivets
connecting it.

39:41.190 --> 39:42.620
I’ve been doing
some research with Gypsy

39:42.620 --> 39:46.260
and with Donna, and it appears
to be from the 1870s.

39:46.390 --> 39:50.130
The Sam Bass legend
is so well known,

39:50.130 --> 39:51.720
how could it have
possibly escaped

39:51.720 --> 39:52.660
\h-the attention...
-Private property.

39:52.660 --> 39:54.660
-Private property.
-The owners have never...

39:54.660 --> 39:57.000
No interest in searching it up
until they were approached by...

39:57.000 --> 39:59.130
-Really?
-That-that’s what I was told.

39:59.130 --> 40:01.090
Well, you know,
this local lore--

40:01.090 --> 40:02.360
it seems to be just that
until you start

40:02.360 --> 40:03.660
pulling stuff like this
out of the ground.

40:03.660 --> 40:05.590
And what started to emerge to me
in that moment

40:05.590 --> 40:08.390
at Sam Bass Springs in
particular was, like, you know,

40:08.390 --> 40:10.590
find, find, find.

40:10.590 --> 40:13.360
And you start to go,
"This is a camp."

40:13.360 --> 40:15.360
MARTY:
That makes complete sense.

40:15.360 --> 40:16.520
Made all the sense in the world.

40:16.520 --> 40:19.390
Is this the shovel
that Sam Bass used

40:19.390 --> 40:21.390
to bury gold on that site?

40:21.390 --> 40:22.520
MARTY:
Could be.

40:22.520 --> 40:24.190
Here’s my question:
this is tantalizing, right?

40:24.190 --> 40:25.750
But are the ladies done
or are they going back?

40:25.750 --> 40:28.330
Oh, they’re going back.
They’re not done.

40:28.330 --> 40:30.390
Anyone who knows
treasure hunting at all

40:30.390 --> 40:32.720
knows that these things
take time.

40:32.720 --> 40:35.260
-Hello, Oak Island, right?
-Yes. Yes.

40:35.260 --> 40:37.360
So, they’re not done
by any stretch.

40:37.360 --> 40:38.060
They are moving on,

40:38.060 --> 40:40.490
so she definitely wants
to go back to the spring.

40:40.490 --> 40:42.130
’Cause we didn’t have
heavy digging equipment.

40:42.130 --> 40:43.660
We didn’t have a jackhammer,
we didn’t have anything

40:43.660 --> 40:45.260
-to breach it
if she did get a hit.
-Mm-hmm.

40:45.260 --> 40:48.260
So, more work needs
to be done, definitely.

40:48.260 --> 40:50.190
They’re onto something, right?

40:50.190 --> 40:50.720
And-and, uh, you know,

40:50.720 --> 40:53.330
it’s all about filling in
the pages of history,

40:53.330 --> 40:55.230
and that’s where
we started, right?

40:55.230 --> 40:57.090
We started with the hope
that science

40:57.090 --> 40:59.520
would really break
the Oak Island mystery.

40:59.520 --> 41:01.720
But we know now that
there are limitations to it.

41:01.720 --> 41:05.660
There’s certainly connective
tissue between our search

41:05.660 --> 41:08.190
and what these people
are-are pursuing.

41:08.190 --> 41:11.000
So, when you can
tie that together--

41:11.000 --> 41:12.130
our experience with theirs--

41:12.130 --> 41:14.660
I think it’s all that much
more enjoyable.

41:14.660 --> 41:16.060
-Yeah.
-That’s what I think.

41:16.060 --> 41:19.190
Yeah, which leads you
to the obvious conclusion

41:19.190 --> 41:20.520
that we have
a lot more to do here.

41:20.520 --> 41:22.720
-We have. We have more than
enough to do here.
-Yeah. We...

41:22.720 --> 41:25.460
We’re right in the midst of
that right now, so...

41:25.460 --> 41:26.060
Good job.

41:26.060 --> 41:28.390
-Let’s go find some of this
out there.
-There we go.
