THAT MY REAL SISTER'S NAME

20:54.778 --> 20:56.295
DOESN'T GET DRAGGED
THROUGH THE MUD,

20:56.372 --> 20:58.247
AND, BY THE WAY,
WHY ARE YOU SO CONCERNED

20:58.324 --> 21:00.249
WITH SAVING THIS LAUREL?

21:00.260 --> 21:02.209
I MEAN, SHE'S MORE LIKE OUR
LAUREL THAN YOU REALIZE.

21:02.286 --> 21:04.962
SHE HELPED OLIVER GET OUT
OF PRISON THE LEGAL WAY,

21:04.973 --> 21:09.141
AND SHE STOPPED ME FROM
KILLING RICARDO DIAZ.

21:09.218 --> 21:11.719
FELICITY SMOAK IS
KILLING PEOPLE NOW?

21:11.795 --> 21:13.479
I REALLY HAVE
MISSED A LOT.

21:13.556 --> 21:15.180
THE POINT IS,
IS THAT I DIDN'T KILL ANYONE

21:15.191 --> 21:17.141
BECAUSE LAUREL PULLED
ME BACK FROM THE EDGE.

21:17.151 --> 21:18.892
THAT'S WHAT I WANT TO
DO FOR HER NOW,

21:18.969 --> 21:21.103
YOU KNOW, SEND HER
OUT A LIFELINE.

21:21.180 --> 21:24.657
EVEN IF THERE WAS A WAY BACK FOR
LAUREL, SHE HAS TO WANT IT.

21:24.734 --> 21:26.775
YOU CAN'T FORCE
REDEMPTION ON PEOPLE.

21:26.852 --> 21:29.361
OH, THAT I KNOW.

21:29.438 --> 21:31.322
WELL, IT'S ALL THEORETICAL
ANYWAY SINCE I HAVE NO IDEA

21:31.332 --> 21:34.450
WHERE SHADOW THIEF OR
LAUREL ARE OPERATING OUT OF.

21:34.526 --> 21:36.711
HOLD THAT THOUGHT.
DINAH JUST GOT A LOCATION

21:36.787 --> 21:38.871
ON SHADOW THIEF'S
SECRET HIDEOUT.

21:38.881 --> 21:42.124
TURNS OUT--OF
COURSE, OF COURSE--

21:42.201 --> 21:45.919
IT'S AT A SHADY WAREHOUSE
IN A SHADY PART OF TOWN.

21:45.996 --> 21:47.629
IS THAT WHERE LAUREL'S
BEEN HOLING UP?

21:47.706 --> 21:49.965
THAT'S WHAT DINAH THINKS.

21:50.042 --> 21:51.633
MAN, IT IS COMPLETELY
OFF THE GRID.

21:51.710 --> 21:53.469
[CELL PHONE CHIMES]

21:53.545 --> 21:55.429
DINAH WANTS ME TO GO WITH HER
SO SHE DOESN'T GO IN BLIND.

21:55.506 --> 21:57.356
SO WE DON'T GO
IN BLIND.

21:57.433 --> 22:01.518
UM, NO. MMM. THIS IS
MORE OF A TWO-WOMAN JOB.

22:01.529 --> 22:03.312
DINAH WANTS TO KEEP IT
ABOVE BOARD.

22:03.389 --> 22:07.533
NO. GOT IT.
NOT INVITED.

22:07.610 --> 22:09.702
- OK.
- OK.

THE POINT OR ANYTHING,

REALLY NICE TO HAVE

- CAN WE TALK ABOUT THIS LATER?
- MM-HMM.

22:21.382 --> 22:23.165
WHO'S HERE
BESIDES US?

22:23.242 --> 22:24.792
THERE'S ONLY TWO HEAT SIGNATURES
IN THE ENTIRE BUILDING

22:24.868 --> 22:26.260
BESIDES US, AND--

22:30.249 --> 22:32.224
THEY'RE RIGHT
BEHIND THIS DOOR.

22:32.301 --> 22:34.101
IT'S GOT TO BE SHADOW

22:36.564 --> 22:38.272
- YOU READY?
- MM-HMM.

22:47.558 --> 22:49.575
WHERE ARE THEY?

22:49.652 --> 22:52.069
- THEY PLAYED US.
- FAKE HEAT SIGNATURES?

AND IMPRESSIVE.

TO KILL US.

COULD HAVE USED SOME

AFTER ALL.

- SORRY.

AT THE LAIR?

NO, NOT YET.

23:23.594 --> 23:24.893
THEY WERE
SLOPPY, THOUGH.

23:24.970 --> 23:26.278
PROBABLY TOO FIXATED
ON KILLING US.

23:26.355 --> 23:28.105
THE TECH THAT SHADOW THIEF
LEFT BEHIND

23:28.116 --> 23:29.731
WILL PROBABLY GIVE US SOME
INSIGHT ON HOW SHE OPERATES.

23:29.808 --> 23:31.534
WITH ANY LUCK, THAT'S
HOW WE'LL FIND HER.

23:33.604 --> 23:36.447
I'M SO SORRY.

23:36.523 --> 23:39.032
I REALLY THOUGHT
LAUREL HAD CHANGED.

23:39.043 --> 23:41.201
WELL, THAT'S ALL RIGHT.
WE'RE JUST LUCKY

23:41.278 --> 23:42.786

AND MESSED UP.

23:42.797 --> 23:45.798
- YEAH.

I MEAN, BLACK SIREN'S
A LETHAL, UNFORGIVING KILLER.

23:49.119 --> 23:51.804
IT'S RARE SHE FAILS,
EVEN RARER SHE DOESN'T DO THE JOB HERSELF.

23:54.500 --> 23:57.560
I'M GONNA GET SOME AIR.
LET ME KNOW IF YOU GUYS FIND ANYTHING.

24:00.964 --> 24:04.150
YOU KNOW, MAYBE IF I COULD
HAVE HELPED MORE OR--

24:04.226 --> 24:08.395

STOP BLAMING YOURSELF.

24:08.472 --> 24:10.990
LAUREL HAD EVERY OPPORTUNITY
TO MAKE THE RIGHT DECISION,

24:11.066 --> 24:12.566
AND SHE DIDN'T.

24:12.643 --> 24:14.160
LAUREL HAS NOT CHANGED.

24:14.236 --> 24:17.821
SHE IS THE SAME MONSTER
WHO KILLED VINNIE.

24:17.832 --> 24:23.660
WHAT LAUREL DID
IS UNFORGIVEABLE,

24:23.671 --> 24:26.079
BUT SHE'S JUST
ON THIS PATH,

24:26.156 --> 24:28.290
AND SHE DOESN'T KNOW
HOW TO GET OFF OF IT.

24:28.301 --> 24:30.459
DO YOU KNOW HOW MANY TIMES IN MY LIFE
I COULD HAVE GONE DOWN THE SAME PATH,

24:30.536 --> 24:32.503
INCLUDING KILLING LAUREL
LAST YEAR, AND I DIDN'T?

24:32.513 --> 24:35.130
YEAH, YOU DIDN'T
BECAUSE YOU HAD US.

24:35.207 --> 24:36.507
I MEAN, WHEN OLIVER
BROUGHT YOU ON THE TEAM,

24:36.583 --> 24:38.342
YOU WEREN'T
EXACTLY A SAINT.

24:38.352 --> 24:40.260
I WAS PROTECTING WOMEN WHO
COULDN'T PROTECT THEMSELVES.

24:40.337 --> 24:42.855
YES, BUT EVEN IN YOUR
DARKEST OF TIMES,

24:42.932 --> 24:44.690
EVEN WHEN YOU WERE
HELL-BENT ON KILLING LAUREL,

YOUR BACK.

A SECOND CHANCE,

AND LOOK WHERE YOU
ARE NOW.

24:49.188 --> 24:50.863

OF THE SCPD,

24:50.940 --> 24:52.523
YOU'RE A DEPUTIZED
VIGILANTE.

24:52.533 --> 24:54.691
I MEAN, YOU COULDN'T
POSSIBLY HAVE IMAGINED

24:54.702 --> 24:56.443
THAT THIS IS WHERE
YOU WOULD HAVE ENDED UP.

24:56.520 --> 24:58.862
NO, THAT'S TRUE, BUT I--

24:58.873 --> 25:01.657
I'M GRATEFUL FOR OLIVER
AND FOR THE WHOLE TEAM,

25:01.733 --> 25:03.534
BUT I DON'T THINK
IT MATTERS WITH LAUREL.

25:03.544 --> 25:05.827
I DON'T THINK SHE EVER EVEN
WANTED THAT KIND OF SUPPORT.

25:05.904 --> 25:08.205
OR MAYBE SHE WANTED
IT MORE THAN ANY OF US

25:08.216 --> 25:10.090
AND DIDN'T REALIZE IT
UNTIL IT WAS GONE.

25:21.003 --> 25:22.728

25:22.805 --> 25:25.064

TO THE CANARIES,

OUT THERE ON YOUR OWN,

MAKE IT BACK ALIVE.

YOUR SAFE HOUSES, DINAH.

AROUND AND WAIT FOR THEM

25:38.228 --> 25:41.363
TO MASSACRE
THE REST OF US.

25:41.440 --> 25:43.749
BELIEVE ME, THERE IS NOTHING
I WOULD LOVE MORE THAN TO SEE

25:43.826 --> 25:46.159
THOSE SONS OF BITCHES PAY FOR
WHAT THEY DID TO MY GIRLS.

25:46.236 --> 25:47.753
SO WHY DON'T YOU?

25:47.830 --> 25:50.539
BECAUSE I KNOW I
CAN'T DO IT ALONE,

25:50.616 --> 25:52.499
AND NEITHER CAN YOU.

25:52.576 --> 25:54.376
THEN COME WITH ME.

25:54.453 --> 25:55.836
INSTEAD OF HIDING
IN THE SHADOWS,

25:55.912 --> 25:57.838
LET'S TAKE THIS FIGHT
TO GALAXY ONE,

25:57.914 --> 26:01.592
MAKE THEM PAY
FOR BLOOD WITH BLOOD.

26:01.602 --> 26:04.177
SOMETIMES, I DON'T KNOW
WHO YOU SOUND MORE LIKE--

26:04.254 --> 26:05.980
YOUR MOTHER
OR YOUR FATHER.

26:09.801 --> 26:13.061
DO YOU KNOW WHY
I STARTED THE CANARIES,

26:13.138 --> 26:15.897
WHAT IT REPRESENTS?

26:15.974 --> 26:20.119
THIS IS MORE THAN JUST
SOME REBELLION GROUP.

26:20.195 --> 26:22.538
IT'S A SUPPORT SYSTEM.

26:22.615 --> 26:25.407
THIS IS A WAY FOR WOMEN TO KNOW
WE ALWAYS HAVE EACH OTHER'S BACKS

26:25.484 --> 26:27.459
NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENS,

26:27.536 --> 26:29.786
WHENEVER WE NEED IT MOST,

26:29.797 --> 26:33.915
SOMETHING I FAILED TO DO
FOR A FRIEND ONCE,

26:33.992 --> 26:35.467
BUT EVER SINCE
THAT HAPPENED WITH HER,

26:35.544 --> 26:37.136
I MADE A PROMISE
TO MYSELF THAT I

26:37.212 --> 26:40.797
WOULD NEVER MAKE
THAT MISTAKE AGAIN.

26:40.808 --> 26:42.308
THAT'S WHY WE WEAR THESE.

26:44.002 --> 26:46.053
TO HONOR THAT PROMISE

26:46.129 --> 26:50.223
AND THE BRAVERY
AND THE SACRIFICE

26:50.300 --> 26:54.144
SHARED WITH THESE
AMAZING WOMEN,

26:54.155 --> 27:00.275
WHO SOMEHOW--NO MATTER HOW MANY
TIMES THEY GET KNOCKED DOWN--

27:00.352 --> 27:02.661
THEY ALWAYS FIND
THE STRENGTH

27:02.738 --> 27:06.206
TO GET BACK UP
AND FIGHT AGAIN...

27:08.193 --> 27:11.995
AND THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT THE
SURVIVING CANARIES ARE GOING TO DO

27:12.006 --> 27:15.674
TOGETHER BUT WHEN
THE TIME IS RIGHT.

27:22.499 --> 27:24.975
IT'S TOO BAD
I'M NOT A CANARY.

27:35.104 --> 27:40.032
DANTE HAS BEEN PULLING THE
STRINGS THIS ENTIRE TIME.

27:40.109 --> 27:42.484
HE ORCHESTRATES
HER MOTHER'S MURDER,

27:42.561 --> 27:46.038
AND HE SENDS HER
DOWN THIS PATH.

27:46.115 --> 27:48.615
SOUNDS LIKE YOU'RE SOFTENING
UP ON YOUR SISTER AGAIN.

27:48.692 --> 27:51.451
I JUST HAVE A BETTER UNDERSTANDING
OF WHY SHE'S DONE WHAT SHE'S DONE.

27:51.528 --> 27:54.705
WHEN EMIKO REALIZES THAT DANTE
HAS BEEN MANIPULATING HER,

27:54.715 --> 27:58.217
IT WILL DRIVE A WEDGE BETWEEN
HER AND THE NINTH CIRCLE.

28:01.371 --> 28:03.222
THAT'S HOW WE
STOP THEM.

28:11.557 --> 28:13.974
SARA: THOUGHT I MIGHT
FIND YOU HERE.

28:14.050 --> 28:16.226
IT'S PRETTY BRAVE
OF YOU,

28:16.237 --> 28:18.562
SNEAKING UP ON ME
FROM BEHIND.

28:18.638 --> 28:20.564
IF YOU WANTED
TO KILL PEOPLE,

28:20.574 --> 28:22.574
YOU WOULDN'T HAVE GAVE
THEM THAT WARNING TIME

28:22.651 --> 28:24.827
BEFORE THE BOMB
WENT OFF.

28:26.321 --> 28:28.155
I REALLY MISS HIM.

28:28.165 --> 28:30.157
IT LOOKS LIKE
YOU DO, TOO.

28:30.233 --> 28:32.918
IS THIS YOU TRYING TO
CONVINCE ME THAT I'VE CHANGED,

28:32.995 --> 28:34.911
THAT I'M MORE LIKE
YOUR LAUREL?

28:34.988 --> 28:39.249
NO. NOBODY'S AS GOOD AS
THE ORIGINAL LAUREL LANCE,

28:39.260 --> 28:41.051
NOT EVEN ME.

28:44.214 --> 28:47.841
LOOK. I DON'T KNOW WHAT
YOU'VE HEARD ABOUT ME,

28:47.918 --> 28:50.510
BUT BASICALLY,
I HAD AN AFFAIR

28:50.587 --> 28:52.554
WITH MY SISTER'S
BOYFRIEND,

28:52.631 --> 28:56.391
I ALLOWED MY ENTIRE FAMILY
TO THINK THAT I WAS DEAD,

28:56.468 --> 28:58.894
AND THEN I BECAME A
LEAGUE-TRAINED ASSASSIN.

28:58.970 --> 29:01.188
WOW. THAT'S IMPRESSIVE.

29:01.264 --> 29:03.774
MY POINT IS EVEN
SOMEONE WITH A PAST

29:03.784 --> 29:06.943
AS CHECKERED AS MINE CAN
STILL TURN THEIR LIFE AROUND,

29:06.954 --> 29:08.612
CAN BE A HERO.

29:08.622 --> 29:10.405
I WAS BEING A HERO.

29:10.482 --> 29:12.458
I WAS THE D.A.,
I GOT OLIVER OUT OF PRISON,

29:12.534 --> 29:14.242
AND I WAS THE ONLY
ONE WHO FIGURED OUT

29:14.319 --> 29:16.578
THAT HIS LITTLE SISTER
WAS BASICALLY THE DEVIL,

29:16.655 --> 29:18.297
AND THEY STILL
TURNED ON ME.

29:18.373 --> 29:21.124
SO, WHAT, YOU THINK
YOU DESERVE A MEDAL

29:21.135 --> 29:24.252
FOR TRYING TO BE
GOOD FOR 5 SECONDS?

29:24.329 --> 29:28.548
REDEMPTION ISN'T A DESTINATION.
IT'S A JOURNEY.

29:28.625 --> 29:32.052
I WASTED YEARS
RUNNING AWAY

29:32.128 --> 29:33.929
FROM ALL THE BAD THINGS
THAT I HAD DONE

29:34.005 --> 29:36.815
BECAUSE I DIDN'T WANT TO FACE
THE PAIN THAT I HAD CAUSED

29:36.892 --> 29:40.268
BECAUSE I DIDN'T WANT
TO BE THAT PERSON,

29:40.345 --> 29:46.316
AND THEN I REALIZED THE ONLY
WAY TO STOP BEING THAT PERSON

29:46.327 --> 29:48.318
WAS TO COME HOME
AND OWN UP

29:48.329 --> 29:50.320
TO THE THINGS
THAT I HAD DONE,

29:50.331 --> 29:53.156
AND, YEAH, IT WAS
PAINFUL,

29:53.167 --> 29:55.742
AND IT TOOK
A REALLY LONG TIME,

29:55.819 --> 29:59.412
BUT IT WAS THE ONLY WAY
TO BECOME SOMEONE ELSE,

29:59.489 --> 30:01.799
SOMEONE BETTER
THAN WHO I WAS.

30:03.660 --> 30:06.586
WELL, THAT'S GREAT
FOR YOU,

30:06.663 --> 30:09.422
BUT EVEN IF I WANTED
TO CHANGE,

30:09.499 --> 30:11.967
IT'S A LITTLE BIT
TOO LATE

30:12.043 --> 30:14.061
BECAUSE THIS IS
WHO I AM.

30:24.031 --> 30:28.650
HEH. I WAS STARTING TO
THINK YOU MIGHT NOT SHOW.

30:28.727 --> 30:31.152
I HAD SOME BUSINESS
TO TAKE CARE OF.

30:31.229 --> 30:34.706
SO WHAT'S THIS WEAPON
THAT WE'RE STEALING?

30:34.783 --> 30:38.585
WHO CARES? ALL THAT MATTERS
IS THAT WE'RE GETTING PAID.

30:40.530 --> 30:43.123

30:43.199 --> 30:44.424
ABSOLUTELY.

SEEMS THIN.

INTO SOME GUARDS.

WE'RE HITTING IT NOW?

30:58.807 --> 31:00.315
I'M GONNA CHECK OUT
THE SOUTH WING.

- YOU.
- DON'T LOOK SURPRISED.

31:24.074 --> 31:26.499
YOUR FRIEND'S SUIT IS
BASICALLY A GIANT TRACKER.

31:26.576 --> 31:29.252
DINAH: AND WE HAPPEN TO KNOW SOMEBODY
WHO'S VERY GOOD WITH A COMPUTER.

31:29.263 --> 31:30.879
YOU BROUGHT YOUR
LITTLE FRIEND WITH YOU.

31:30.956 --> 31:32.514
HOW TYPICAL.

31:32.591 --> 31:34.049
IT'S NOT TOO LATE,

31:34.125 --> 31:35.934
DON'T DO THIS.

31:36.011 --> 31:38.678

IS GETTING A LITTLE OLD.

[DEVICE BEEPING]

31:54.696 --> 31:56.571

31:56.648 --> 32:00.292
UGH. GOD. YOU'RE
HERE, TOO?

32:00.369 --> 32:02.744
DO YOU KNOW WHAT SHADOW THIEF IS
PLANNING TO DO WITH THAT DEVICE?

32:02.821 --> 32:04.913
YES. SELL IT
FOR A LOT OF MONEY

32:04.990 --> 32:06.581
OF WHICH I GET HALF.

32:06.658 --> 32:08.541

GONNA SELL IT TO,

32:08.618 --> 32:10.043
THE GIRL SCOUTS?

32:10.120 --> 32:12.045
