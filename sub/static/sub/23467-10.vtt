Dale kept mouthing off,

00:21.456 --> 00:23.110
and I slapped him.

00:23.153 --> 00:24.111
DALE:
I'm gonna sue you,

00:24.154 --> 00:25.416
you...

00:25.460 --> 00:27.418
Is he suing me?

00:27.462 --> 00:29.681
I just want to ask you
for your forgiveness.

00:29.725 --> 00:31.161
Just go home, Ken.

00:31.205 --> 00:33.076
-Just go home.

00:33.120 --> 00:35.209
Oh.

00:36.732 --> 00:38.951
Hey, good news, everybody!

00:38.995 --> 00:40.692
I'm engaged!

00:40.736 --> 00:42.564
And she's got a Jeep.

00:42.607 --> 00:43.956
This is Shannon.

00:44.000 --> 00:45.915

It's her thing.

-I'm fine.

01:01.539 --> 01:03.585
-Yes, Mom. I'm fine. Thank you.
-What's that,

-a woodchuck or a wolverine
or something?
Where?

01:06.544 --> 01:08.198
Right there.
He just scurried away.

01:08.242 --> 01:09.373
-Oh, wow.

Oh, beautiful.

-Right there. I saw him.

01:17.816 --> 01:19.340
-He was getting a stick.
-KEN: Oh.

01:19.383 --> 01:20.819
Have you seen the pictures
of the cabin?

01:20.863 --> 01:23.257
I mean, it's amazing.

01:23.300 --> 01:25.172

-And it's... Yes.

And it's all-inclusive,
and it's fully stocked, Chip,

01:29.306 --> 01:30.786
with food and everything.

01:30.829 --> 01:32.222
-Oh, it's stocked with food.
-Yeah.

01:32.266 --> 01:33.571
I don't care where it is

01:33.615 --> 01:35.312
or what it has or any of that

as long as we're all together
on New Year's.

01:37.227 --> 01:41.188
Oh, and I have
an addition to it.

01:41.231 --> 01:43.494
I was at the dollar store,
and I couldn't resist.

01:43.538 --> 01:46.149
-I got us these! For New Year's.

01:46.193 --> 01:47.759
2009?

01:47.803 --> 01:50.414
I know, 2009, but still.

01:50.458 --> 01:52.808
I mean, I didn't want
to look through a one, anyway.

01:52.851 --> 01:55.071
If I would've got the right one.

01:55.115 --> 01:56.812
Well, maybe it'll become
fashionable again.

01:56.855 --> 01:59.380
Oh, these cabins look so rustic.

01:59.423 --> 02:01.251
Kind of makes you realize

02:01.295 --> 02:04.254
how cosmopolitan Bakersfield is.

02:04.298 --> 02:06.213
-I can't really make out
the addresses on the cabins.

02:06.256 --> 02:08.606
Well, it's got to be
around here somewhere.

02:08.650 --> 02:10.652
-Just look for the big cabin
with...
-Oh, look, look, look.

02:10.695 --> 02:12.828

Oh, yeah.

02:16.266 --> 02:17.224
KEN:
Yeah.

02:17.267 --> 02:19.139
That's the cabin?

02:24.492 --> 02:26.450
This is not like the pictures.

02:26.494 --> 02:28.452
Oh, I think it's cute.

02:28.496 --> 02:30.585
Dale, Shannon, we're here!

02:30.628 --> 02:31.890
I'm gonna call the owner.

02:31.934 --> 02:34.284
This isn't right.

02:34.328 --> 02:35.851
The asbestos is making me horny.
Come on.

02:35.894 --> 02:37.287
Hello, Mother.

02:37.331 --> 02:38.897
-Hi.
-Hello, Chip.

02:38.941 --> 02:40.203
Hey, Dale.

02:40.247 --> 02:41.422
That's all
I'm gonna say hello to.

02:41.465 --> 02:43.206
Hi, Dale.

02:43.250 --> 02:44.425
Mom, you remember, uh,

02:44.468 --> 02:46.078
-Shannon.
-Hey, y'all.

02:46.122 --> 02:49.081
Yeah. Hi, Shannon.

02:49.125 --> 02:50.431
It's only like the heat's on
in the bedroom.

02:50.474 --> 02:52.259
It's cold out here.

02:52.302 --> 02:55.262
Well, that's the sex heat.

02:55.305 --> 02:58.308
-Mm.
-Real, uh, bummer
of a cabin, Ken.

02:58.352 --> 03:00.310
Shannon deserves better
than this.

03:00.354 --> 03:02.443
-You deserve better than this.
-I do. I can't wait

03:02.486 --> 03:05.054
for you to get your Dodge Viper.

03:05.097 --> 03:07.883
Well, as soon as Craig calls me
from the dealership, you'll...

03:07.926 --> 03:10.668
you'll be behind the wheel
of that Viper.

03:10.712 --> 03:13.236
We took the master bedroom.

03:13.280 --> 03:14.455
There's some, uh, bunk beds

03:14.498 --> 03:16.718
in the other rooms, so...

03:16.761 --> 03:18.328
Dale, Ken paid
for the whole cabin.

03:18.372 --> 03:19.634
We should get
the master bedroom.

03:19.677 --> 03:21.070
Well, Mom,

03:21.113 --> 03:22.506
as the expression goes,

03:22.550 --> 03:24.508
if you're a loser,
you're a snoozer.

03:24.552 --> 03:26.336
So, we're off.

03:26.380 --> 03:27.642
-Ooh.
-Yeah.

03:27.685 --> 03:30.340
And, yes, we did try out
the bunk beds.

03:30.384 --> 03:33.343
[Shannon and Dale laughing
and speaking indistinctly]

03:35.563 --> 03:37.826
I can't get no service.

03:37.869 --> 03:40.394
Well, we're in the middle
of nowhere.

03:40.437 --> 03:41.612
KEN:
They said it was

03:41.656 --> 03:43.179
fully stocked with food.

03:43.223 --> 03:45.137
Maybe there's a chest
or freezer.

03:45.181 --> 03:47.052
I don't know.

03:47.096 --> 03:48.750
You and Mom want that bed?

03:48.793 --> 03:50.404
Maybe I'll text

03:50.447 --> 03:52.710
Ivy and Monica.
They're on their way up here.

03:52.754 --> 03:54.495
Maybe they can bring some food.

03:54.538 --> 03:55.670
Hey, board games.

03:55.713 --> 03:56.975
KEN:
Oh, great.

03:57.019 --> 03:59.413
That'll give us something to do.

03:59.456 --> 04:00.675
They have, uh,
Chutes and Ladders.

04:00.718 --> 04:02.198
Chinese checkers.

04:02.242 --> 04:04.287
-Regular checkers.
-Hey, Chip.

04:04.331 --> 04:05.288
They have Twister.

04:05.332 --> 04:07.508
Could you imagine
Mom playing Twister?

04:07.551 --> 04:09.988
No, I can't imagine that.
Uh, Chip.

04:10.032 --> 04:11.207
They have Hungry Hippo, too.

04:11.251 --> 04:13.078
Oh, yeah.
Darla loved that game.

04:13.122 --> 04:15.559
-Parcheesi.
-Chip, listen to me.

04:15.603 --> 04:18.083
-Uh, I'm gonna ask you
something.
-Mm-hmm.

04:18.127 --> 04:19.781
Well, you know how I feel

04:19.824 --> 04:21.348
-I do.

04:21.391 --> 04:24.916
I mean, that week when...

04:24.960 --> 04:27.354
that we weren't together,
I was wrecked.

04:27.397 --> 04:28.746
Yeah.

04:28.790 --> 04:31.532
And part of me
renting this cabin

04:31.575 --> 04:34.274
and bringing everybody up here
was so...

04:36.580 --> 04:39.322
Well, it was so I could propose.

04:39.366 --> 04:40.802
Propose what?

04:40.845 --> 04:43.326
Marriage. To your mom.

04:43.370 --> 04:46.938
And I wanted to make sure
I had your blessing.

04:49.637 --> 04:52.466
Yeah.

04:52.509 --> 04:54.816
S

04:54.859 --> 04:57.471
Well, n-not exactly.

04:59.037 --> 05:01.692
I don't know. I... Yeah.

05:01.736 --> 05:03.390
Yeah.

05:03.433 --> 05:05.130
Okay.

05:05.174 --> 05:06.523
Sure, you have my blessing.

05:06.567 --> 05:09.439
-Yeah.

05:09.483 --> 05:12.529
-Should we... I guess we'll hug.
-I guess.

05:13.400 --> 05:15.837
-Do me a favor, though.

05:15.880 --> 05:18.535
Don't kill yourself
like my birth dad did.

05:20.537 --> 05:22.539
Okay.

05:25.455 --> 05:26.935
I'll take this.

05:26.978 --> 05:28.415
I should just...

05:28.458 --> 05:30.634
-Should I just call you Ken,
though?
-Yeah.

05:30.678 --> 05:32.244
Ken is fine.

05:32.288 --> 05:34.464
All right, Dad... um, Ken.

05:34.508 --> 05:37.815
Should I call you "son"
or just Chipper?

05:37.859 --> 05:39.426
Just don't call me Dale.

05:39.469 --> 05:41.819
Fair enough.

05:41.863 --> 05:43.430
There she is.

05:43.473 --> 05:45.780
-Oh.
-My soon-to-be daughter-in-law.

05:45.823 --> 05:46.781
Yeah.

05:46.824 --> 05:49.479
Mm-hmm.

05:50.567 --> 05:54.223
So, where are you from?

05:54.266 --> 05:56.530
-Florida.

05:56.573 --> 05:58.270
Oh, you like that stuff,

05:58.314 --> 05:59.446
don't you?

05:59.489 --> 06:01.448
Oh, yeah. It gives you wings.

06:01.491 --> 06:04.494
I don't think
I've ever tasted Red Bull.

06:04.538 --> 06:06.757
Yeah. Why not?

06:06.801 --> 06:08.455
You only live once, right?

06:08.498 --> 06:10.500
Well...

06:10.544 --> 06:12.546
-Pretty can.
-Mm-hmm.

06:13.895 --> 06:15.853
Oh.

06:15.897 --> 06:17.594
Has a little kick to it, huh?

06:17.638 --> 06:19.466
-Geez.
-Mm-hmm.

06:19.509 --> 06:22.338
Hey, uh,

06:22.382 --> 06:24.906
how many times you been married?

06:26.342 --> 06:27.648
Couple times.

06:27.691 --> 06:29.650
I had a feeling.

06:29.693 --> 06:31.478
-Yeah.
-I got a couple kids.

06:31.521 --> 06:34.350
-Oh.
-Uh, had the first one
when I was 14.

06:34.394 --> 06:37.701
-Oh, my goodness.
-I know.

06:37.745 --> 06:40.487
-Well...

06:40.530 --> 06:42.706
-It's a whirlwind.
-Well, yeah.

06:42.750 --> 06:46.318
I mean, he's kind of a project.
You know, they all are.

06:46.362 --> 06:48.538
Yeah. Ain't that the truth, huh?

06:48.582 --> 06:50.453
Yeah.

06:50.497 --> 06:52.237
You gonna finish that?

06:52.281 --> 06:54.588
I don't think I am
a Red Bull girl.

06:54.631 --> 06:57.155
I think you're more
of a Red Bull girl.

06:57.199 --> 06:58.461
Oh, yeah. You don't want
to waste that.

06:58.505 --> 07:01.072
Yeah. Yeah, no.
You don't want to waste that.

07:01.116 --> 07:03.597
-No.
-No.

07:03.640 --> 07:05.512
Well, good talk.

07:05.555 --> 07:07.557
Yeah.

DALE: Whoever it is,
I'm trying to sleep.

07:14.956 --> 07:17.088
Come in!

07:17.132 --> 07:19.743
Oh. It's you.

07:19.787 --> 07:22.050
I'm not sure I want
a slapping madman at my door.

07:22.093 --> 07:24.748
Dale, please.
I'm trying to get past this.

07:24.792 --> 07:26.097
Well, I don't know
if I'm the kind of guy

07:26.141 --> 07:27.490
that gets past things.

07:27.534 --> 07:30.406
-Dale, please.

07:30.450 --> 07:32.190
Please.

07:32.234 --> 07:35.411
I'd like to ask you
something important.

07:37.152 --> 07:38.545
What?!

07:42.549 --> 07:45.856
-They're here.

07:45.900 --> 07:47.205
Hey!

07:47.249 --> 07:48.990
-You made it.
-Hi, Daddy. Yes, we did.

07:49.033 --> 07:51.340
-MRS. BASKETS: My girls!
-MONICA: Oh, Christine.

07:51.383 --> 07:53.603
Hi. How are you?

Oh, you're looking beautiful.

07:54.822 --> 07:56.171
-Thank you. So do you.
-Oh, thank you. You do, too.

07:56.214 --> 07:57.999
This is my son Dale.

-MONICA: Hi, Dale.
-Uh, Chip.

-Hi, Chip.
-MRS. BASKETS: Oh, Chip. Oh!

08:00.915 --> 08:02.786
-Chip.
-Sorry, Chip.

08:02.830 --> 08:04.571
Oh. Oh, you brought the food!

08:07.704 --> 08:09.445
MRS. BASKETS: Try the pineapple.
It's so delicious.

08:09.489 --> 08:11.795
I'm trying to stay away from,
from so much sugar, though.

08:11.839 --> 08:13.667
-MRS. BASKETS: It's so good.
-IVY: I know.

08:15.799 --> 08:17.192
-Oh, my God, I love your hair.
-MRS. BASKETS: Oh.

08:17.235 --> 08:18.672
Oh, it's so long.

08:18.715 --> 08:21.152
-Ooh, please don't touch me.
-Well...

08:21.196 --> 08:22.676
That's Dale's fiancée.

-MONICA: Hey.
-IVY: Hi.
-SHANNON: Hi, hi.

08:25.853 --> 08:28.812
-No, I don't want a Triscuit.

08:28.856 --> 08:30.161
-No, just... I-I...

No, thank you.

08:31.598 --> 08:32.816
[indistinct chatter
and laughter]

08:32.860 --> 08:33.904
Is this about Mom?

08:33.948 --> 08:35.602
When are you gonna ask her?

08:35.645 --> 08:38.474
I tried Red Bull for the first
time, can you believe that?

08:38.518 --> 08:41.216
I don't know if it's even
the right time, Chip.

08:41.259 --> 08:43.653
This is perfect.
-No.

08:43.697 --> 08:47.831
Well, because...
Dale told me earlier

08:47.875 --> 08:52.183
that he doesn't want me
to marry your mom.

08:53.881 --> 08:55.970
-Dale.
-Yeah.

08:56.013 --> 08:57.798
Can I have a word with you?

08:57.841 --> 09:00.191
-No. No, thank you.
-Dale.

09:00.235 --> 09:01.453
-It's twin stuff.

09:01.497 --> 09:02.585
Let's go. Please.

09:02.629 --> 09:04.282
Sure.

09:04.326 --> 09:05.719
I got to go speak to Chud.

09:05.762 --> 09:07.721
That's a cross between
Chip and Dud.

09:07.764 --> 09:08.983
I came up with that.

09:11.681 --> 09:12.639
What do you want?

09:12.682 --> 09:14.597
I have nothing under this robe

09:14.641 --> 09:17.034
except my genitalia
and a tattoo.

09:17.078 --> 09:19.602
Did you tell Ken
that he can't propose to Mom?

09:19.646 --> 09:22.866
Oh, so you're gonna endorse
a face spanker

09:22.910 --> 09:24.694
You want that in our family?
Is that what you want?

09:24.738 --> 09:26.435
Somebody that's always smacking
you in the face?

09:26.478 --> 09:29.220
'Cause you're gonna get it, too.
You are.

09:29.264 --> 09:30.874
Dale, you can't do this.

09:30.918 --> 09:32.006
It's none of your business,
okay?

09:32.049 --> 09:33.660
It's, uh, that's Mom's business.

09:33.703 --> 09:36.706
Look, the only person getting
married around here is me.

09:36.750 --> 09:38.186
Now, if you'll excuse me,

09:38.229 --> 09:41.276
I have a honeymoon/family
reunion to get back to.

09:48.936 --> 09:50.894
Wait, so I'm just supposed
to eat the marbles, right?

09:50.938 --> 09:52.766
Yeah. You're just a hippo.
You're just trying

09:52.809 --> 09:55.116
to eat the balls;
it's not that complicated.

09:55.159 --> 09:58.902
-At a bar.

09:58.946 --> 10:01.862
-I'm kind of a rodeo groupie.

10:01.905 --> 10:04.081
Well, then, you're just gonna
love Christine's rodeo.

10:05.953 --> 10:07.345
Christine's rodeo?

10:07.389 --> 10:09.696
KEN:
Yeah.

10:09.739 --> 10:12.568
You told me you owned the rodeo.

10:15.919 --> 10:17.355
Well, um...

10:17.399 --> 10:19.662
No, uh, well, Mother
is the ceremonial head,

10:19.706 --> 10:21.490
uh, the face of the,
of the rodeo,

10:21.533 --> 10:23.144
and I'm, uh,
I work the finances.

10:23.187 --> 10:24.885
Thanks a lot, Ken.

10:24.928 --> 10:27.017
You still bull

10:28.976 --> 10:31.587
Let's... What difference
does it make?

10:31.631 --> 10:33.154
Let's play. Come on.

10:33.197 --> 10:34.938
You told me you owned the rodeo

10:34.982 --> 10:36.940
and all these people
work for you.

10:36.984 --> 10:38.725
I don't work for him.

10:39.769 --> 10:41.510
I sell carpet.

10:41.553 --> 10:43.773
SHANNON: He said that he owned
this fancy rodeo,

10:43.817 --> 10:45.775
and that all of you people

10:45.819 --> 10:47.342
and then the other people worked
for you.

10:47.385 --> 10:48.822
He said that he was getting
that Dodge Viper.

10:48.865 --> 10:50.737
Okay, well, I don't understand
what the...

10:50.780 --> 10:52.913
-You might get the Dodge Viper.
-And he said he was real,

10:52.956 --> 10:55.916
real good at the bull-riding,
and I was gonna watch it.

10:55.959 --> 10:57.744
And then maybe we're gonna have,
like...

10:57.787 --> 10:59.833
Why all the questions? Let's
play some Hungry Hippo here.

10:59.876 --> 11:01.617
What's with all the questions?

11:01.661 --> 11:04.359
I mean, these sound like
questions of a gold digger.

11:04.402 --> 11:07.057
-I didn't call you anything.

11:07.101 --> 11:09.494
I said it sounds like the
questions of a gold digger.

11:09.538 --> 11:12.410
Oh. Well...

11:12.454 --> 11:14.761
You called me a gold digger,
did you?

11:14.804 --> 11:15.979
I didn't...

11:16.023 --> 11:18.547
Hey, I was winning!

11:18.590 --> 11:20.854
Where are you going?

11:20.897 --> 11:22.986
I'm going back to Florida.

11:23.030 --> 11:25.380
We're not moving to Florida.

11:25.423 --> 11:27.208
Oh, God. You're not
coming with me.

11:27.251 --> 11:28.426
Shannon.

11:28.470 --> 11:29.950
Shannon!

11:29.993 --> 11:33.040
Goddamn marbles.
Shannon?

11:39.002 --> 11:40.612
-Shannon!

11:40.656 --> 11:43.964
Shannon! Shannon!

11:44.007 --> 11:44.747
Shannon!

11:46.923 --> 11:49.230
Shanny!

11:52.712 --> 11:54.322
Let me have your keys, please.

11:54.365 --> 11:55.627
I need the keys to Mom's car.

11:55.671 --> 11:57.020
That car is
a two-wheel drive, man.

11:57.064 --> 11:58.543
-It won't-it won't...
-My "fiance" just left me!

11:58.587 --> 12:01.851
Give me the keys.
Thank you.

12:04.636 --> 12:07.161
-Come on, come on.

12:08.902 --> 12:10.164
Come on.

12:16.213 --> 12:17.998
KEN:
Told you the thing wouldn't go.

12:18.041 --> 12:20.217
Dale.

12:20.261 --> 12:22.872
Get out, please.

12:22.916 --> 12:25.788
Leave me be, Chip, leave me be.

12:25.832 --> 12:27.790
Dale, come on, get out, please.

12:27.834 --> 12:29.052
We can fix this.

12:30.967 --> 12:33.753
Just get out of the car
so we can talk.

12:39.976 --> 12:43.501
Wha... What?

12:49.116 --> 12:50.857
God.

12:53.294 --> 12:55.862
Ow! Okay, okay.
All right, that's enough.

12:55.905 --> 12:57.211
That's enough. God.

12:57.254 --> 13:00.040
-Dale.
-I mean, this is embarrassing.

13:00.083 --> 13:01.911
-We barely know those people.

13:01.955 --> 13:03.608
We're fighting like idiots.

13:03.652 --> 13:05.001
Boys.

13:05.045 --> 13:06.829
-Mom, stay out of this.

13:06.873 --> 13:08.744
My lady has left me.

13:08.788 --> 13:10.964
This is an embarrassment
to who I am!

13:11.007 --> 13:12.052
What is going on?

13:12.095 --> 13:14.184
You got to stop blaming people.

13:14.228 --> 13:17.666
You got to stop blaming Ken.
You got to stop suing mom.

13:17.709 --> 13:20.321
You got to stop being an asshole
just because you're unhappy.

13:20.364 --> 13:23.411
Oh, yeah? Oh, yeah, that's me.
Uh, everything's my fault!

13:23.454 --> 13:27.067
Well, you know what?
Maybe I am worthless!

13:27.110 --> 13:29.069
Maybe this family would be
better without me!

13:33.029 --> 13:34.291
Shannon!

13:34.335 --> 13:35.771
-Dale.
-I'll be back.

13:35.815 --> 13:37.033
Don't go.

13:37.077 --> 13:38.339
DALE :
Shannon!

13:38.382 --> 13:42.082
Dale, don't go.
You'll freeze to death.

13:42.125 --> 13:43.561
Dale.

13:43.605 --> 13:46.086
There's bears.

13:46.129 --> 13:48.044
Oh, my God.

13:49.350 --> 13:51.047
-I'll get him, Christine.
-Oh...

13:51.091 --> 13:52.657
Are you okay, Chip?

13:52.701 --> 13:53.876
Mom, he's got an ax.

13:55.356 --> 13:57.880
For protection maybe,
I don't know.

14:03.059 --> 14:05.888
MONICA: Ooh, oh, there's
some more over here.

14:05.932 --> 14:08.021
-Oh, uh-oh.

14:08.064 --> 14:10.719
I think the heat just went out.
It's just blowing cold air.

14:10.762 --> 14:12.286
Well, maybe it's something
with the furnace.

14:12.329 --> 14:14.114
-CHIP: Um, okay.

14:14.157 --> 14:16.681
I'll, uh... Maybe it's outside.
I'll go check.

14:16.725 --> 14:17.944
-IVY: Thank you.
-Yeah.

14:17.987 --> 14:20.990
Isn't it weird that we're
looking for marbles,

14:21.034 --> 14:23.166
and all I can think about

14:23.210 --> 14:26.822
is Dale's out there all alone?
Geez.

14:26.866 --> 14:29.085
-Oh, Dad'll find him.

14:29.129 --> 14:31.958
Yes, I do.
I ran off more than once

14:32.001 --> 14:34.047
when I was a kid,
and he always found me.

14:34.090 --> 14:36.963
-Ah!
-Ooh.

14:37.006 --> 14:38.965
-Um...
-Yeah.

14:39.008 --> 14:40.749
-That was...

14:40.792 --> 14:42.055
-loud.
-Yes.

14:42.098 --> 14:44.492
I couldn't get it working.

14:44.535 --> 14:45.841
Oh, honey!

14:45.885 --> 14:47.103
Are you okay?

14:47.147 --> 14:49.018
Yeah. Why?

14:49.062 --> 14:50.933
-MRS. BASKETS: Oh.
-MONICA: Mm.

14:50.977 --> 14:53.022
-That's better.
-Yes.
-Yeah.

14:53.066 --> 14:55.807
MONICA:
Mmm.

14:55.851 --> 14:58.114
:
Oh, God.

15:00.856 --> 15:02.814
Christine, you doing okay?

15:02.858 --> 15:05.948
Oh, I'm worried about Dale.

15:05.992 --> 15:08.211
The last time I saw my husband,

15:08.255 --> 15:10.170
we had a big fight
and a blowout.

15:10.213 --> 15:11.954
And, usually, he just stormed
out of the house.

15:11.998 --> 15:13.651
But this time he stopped

15:13.695 --> 15:16.524
and looked at me and said,

15:16.567 --> 15:17.873
"Maybe this family

15:17.917 --> 15:20.832
wouldbe better without me."

15:20.876 --> 15:22.965
And, uh...

15:23.009 --> 15:25.098
and now...

15:25.141 --> 15:27.230
I'm worried about Dale.

15:27.274 --> 15:29.363
Dale's gonna be fine.

15:29.406 --> 15:31.365
MRS. BASKETS:
You don't know that, Chip.

15:31.408 --> 15:35.238
Dale's not dead. I mean, Dad.
I mean, he's not...

15:35.282 --> 15:37.197
he's not dead or Dad.

15:37.240 --> 15:39.373
-He's just...

15:39.416 --> 15:43.029
He's just ha... Look, he's...

15:43.072 --> 15:45.031
having a tantrum.

15:45.074 --> 15:46.249
That's it.

15:46.293 --> 15:48.338
He'll be fine.

15:48.382 --> 15:50.645
I just want
to make sure he's okay.

15:50.688 --> 15:52.603
Mom, you can't

15:52.647 --> 15:55.824
keep worrying about us, okay?

15:55.867 --> 15:59.001
You can't just fix us.

15:59.045 --> 16:01.656
You bought a rodeo
to try to fix us,

16:01.699 --> 16:05.225
and-and, you know,
we're grown men.

16:07.401 --> 16:11.013
-We have to fix ourselves.

16:11.057 --> 16:13.798
What a disaster
this weekend was.

16:13.842 --> 16:16.018
What do you mean?

16:16.062 --> 16:18.368
Oh, I wanted us
to all have a good time

16:18.412 --> 16:21.241
and a real great family
experience,

16:21.284 --> 16:25.071
so you girls would be okay
with me dating your dad.

16:25.114 --> 16:27.073
-Um...
Christine,

16:27.116 --> 16:29.205
first of all, I'm 43.

16:29.249 --> 16:31.077
We're grown.

16:31.120 --> 16:33.514
You're not in charge
of making this trip fun for us.

16:33.557 --> 16:36.038
-No.
-And, secondly,
we already like you.

16:36.082 --> 16:38.258
Thank you.
-Yes. Yes.
-Yes.

16:38.301 --> 16:40.825
-Thank you, girls.
-We like you.

16:40.869 --> 16:42.392
What is that?

16:42.436 --> 16:43.872
I'm gonna lock my door.

16:43.915 --> 16:45.830
Oh, my God. Play dead.

16:45.874 --> 16:47.441
I can't play...
-Play dead.

16:47.484 --> 16:49.269
MAN:
Ma'am?

16:49.312 --> 16:51.271
-She's dead!

16:51.314 --> 16:52.402
Do you need a tow?

16:52.446 --> 16:54.448
Oh, God.

16:54.491 --> 16:56.232
What are y'all doing
in my driveway?

16:56.276 --> 16:59.322
What are we doing
in yourdriveway?

16:59.366 --> 17:00.541
KEN:
Dale?

17:02.021 --> 17:03.761
Dale!

17:05.807 --> 17:07.809
Dale?

17:12.031 --> 17:14.859
This must make you real happy
to see me like this.

17:14.903 --> 17:17.079
You win, Ken.
Everybody loves Ken.

17:17.123 --> 17:19.212
Come on, Dale.
Let's go home, man.

17:19.255 --> 17:21.562
-Just leave me out here!
-Dale,

17:21.605 --> 17:23.999
it's 20 degrees.
You'll freeze out here.

17:24.043 --> 17:25.348
Well, just let me freeze, okay?

17:25.392 --> 17:28.003
Let me freeze.

17:33.052 --> 17:34.575
I can't go in there.

17:34.618 --> 17:36.272
I can't go and face them.

17:44.193 --> 17:47.196
Then we won't go back
to the cabin.

17:49.416 --> 17:51.026
There you go.

17:51.070 --> 17:53.159
Let's go get something to drink.

17:53.202 --> 17:55.161
What you think, huh?

17:55.204 --> 17:56.988
Come on, now.

18:01.384 --> 18:04.344
She was the love of my life.

18:04.387 --> 18:05.345
Really?

18:05.388 --> 18:07.564
No, probably not.

18:07.608 --> 18:10.001
You know you can't force
these things.

18:10.045 --> 18:12.003
You just got to live your life.

18:12.047 --> 18:13.614
You'll meet somebody.

18:13.657 --> 18:17.183
I'm starting to think
that I might just die alone.

18:18.880 --> 18:21.361
Hey, I've been there, too.
Believe me.

18:21.404 --> 18:24.364
The moment you think you'll
never meet anybody ever again,

18:24.407 --> 18:26.017
suddenly you'll look up,

18:26.061 --> 18:27.584
and there they'll be.

18:30.370 --> 18:33.242
Sorry I slapped you.

18:34.287 --> 18:37.594
It's okay.

18:37.638 --> 18:41.163
I probably slapped a hundred
people in my life in the face.

18:42.556 --> 18:44.166
Flight attendant,

18:44.210 --> 18:47.169
s-stenographer,

18:47.213 --> 18:49.519
a bailiff,

18:49.563 --> 18:51.956
greeter at Walmart.

18:52.000 --> 18:55.264
You know, your mom's
probably worried sick about you.

18:55.308 --> 18:56.222
I don't know about that.

18:57.832 --> 18:59.312
You think you're about ready
to go back?

18:59.355 --> 19:00.617
I...

19:03.881 --> 19:06.623
: I don't know
if she'd want to have me back.

19:06.667 --> 19:10.366
Dale. Dale,

19:10.410 --> 19:14.196
no matter what happens,
you're family.

19:14.240 --> 19:15.458
They know that.

19:15.502 --> 19:17.243
Yeah?

19:17.286 --> 19:19.462
-That's her calling now.

19:19.506 --> 19:21.334
Yes, Christine.

19:21.377 --> 19:24.989
Yes, he's here. He's fine.

19:25.033 --> 19:26.643
No.

19:26.687 --> 19:29.994
Yeah, we're about to head back
to the cabin now.

19:30.038 --> 19:31.822
Wait, what?

19:31.866 --> 19:35.478
KEN: Now, this looks
more like the pictures.

19:35.522 --> 19:38.351
DALE: Well, that explains why
we had to break that back window

19:38.394 --> 19:40.483
in the other cabin.

19:42.877 --> 19:45.053
It's cold.

19:45.096 --> 19:47.447
I'm just stalling
