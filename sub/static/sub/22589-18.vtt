00:10.929 --> 00:15.850
<i>NARRATOR". So far we have seen, outside
the Annual Gotham City Charity Luncheon...</i>

00:16.267 --> 00:19.145
<i>...a different kind of charity.</i>

00:19.521 --> 00:21.731
<i>And a different kind of hero.</i>

00:21.940 --> 00:23.233
<i>The Penguin.</i>

00:23.441 --> 00:27.070
<i>Penguin, a civic-minded citizen?</i>

00:27.403 --> 00:31.407
<i>Holy turnabouts, something's fishy.</i>

00:31.741 --> 00:34.369
<i>Mayor Lindseed, what was it?</i>

00:34.911 --> 00:40.500
<i>Penguin for mayor?
He couldn't possibly win.</i>

00:41.000 --> 00:43.211
<i>Oh, yes, he could.</i>

00:45.088 --> 00:47.799
<i>Disaster for Gotham City.</i>

00:47.966 --> 00:49.592
<i>Only one hope.</i>

00:50.093 --> 00:52.762
<i>Batman for mayor.</i>

00:53.179 --> 00:55.932
<i>The Penguin campaign in high gear.</i>

00:56.766 --> 00:58.935
<i>Penguin posters everywhere.</i>

01:00.520 --> 01:05.108
<i>Batman discussed the issues
to sympathetic supporters...</i>

01:05.441 --> 01:11.155
<i>...while Penguin issued champagne
and other goodies.</i>

01:12.490 --> 01:15.660
<i>The Caped Candidate talked to the voters.</i>

01:16.536 --> 01:19.080
<i>But these voters wanted him out of the race.</i>

01:20.707 --> 01:23.876
<i>Robin, a political liability.</i>

01:24.669 --> 01:27.338
<i>Holy soap suds.</i>

01:27.672 --> 01:31.175
<i>An acid bath that could eat them
clean to the bone.</i>

01:32.176 --> 01:35.054
<i>And a deadly set of scales.</i>

01:36.556 --> 01:40.101
<i>The waddling politico arrives to quack.</i>

01:41.686 --> 01:46.274
<i>Hang on for just one searing minute.</i>

03:03.893 --> 03:06.688
In a few more seconds
we're gonna be in the soup, Batman.

03:06.896 --> 03:08.189
It's all my fault, Robin.

03:08.398 --> 03:11.109
I should have recognized those goons
as soon as I saw them.

03:17.990 --> 03:21.244
Well, here goes.

03:22.829 --> 03:24.747
Batman!

03:25.331 --> 03:26.374
Batman!

03:29.293 --> 03:32.380
- Batman, are you all right?
-Yes, thanks to Alfred.

03:32.588 --> 03:36.467
Lucky he insisted on making these
new costumes out of acid-proof material.

03:36.801 --> 03:40.263
Holy coffin nails, Batman,
you sure had me scared.

03:40.680 --> 03:43.599
Just a second while I dissolve these thongs.

03:51.941 --> 03:54.819
Now to get you down from there,
then we'll get out of here.

03:59.198 --> 04:00.241
Like them, Pengy?

04:00.450 --> 04:02.827
Never mind the buttons, Lulu.

04:03.035 --> 04:04.996
Batman is no longer with us.

04:05.204 --> 04:07.665
As of now it's a one-man race.

04:07.874 --> 04:10.376
- Then you should win it easily.
-Hwah, hwah, hwah.

04:10.585 --> 04:13.337
That's very true. Thank you. Thank you.

04:14.797 --> 04:16.298
What?

04:16.466 --> 04:18.091
Hwah?

04:18.968 --> 04:21.095
Acid-proof costumes?

04:21.303 --> 04:23.681
Faugh. Faugh them.

04:23.890 --> 04:25.808
Well, he's not smear-proof.

04:26.017 --> 04:28.394
And when I get through with him
on our TV debate...

04:28.603 --> 04:31.439
...even his own mother won't vote for him.

04:31.647 --> 04:33.149
This is ridiculous, Batman.

04:33.357 --> 04:37.111
Debating the Penguin on television
when he tried to kill you not two hours ago.

04:37.320 --> 04:39.363
Unfortunately we have no proof.

04:39.572 --> 04:42.867
If I mention that,
the Fair Campaign Practices Committee...

04:43.075 --> 04:45.328
...would accuse me of using smear tactics.

04:45.536 --> 04:47.455
I certainly wouldn't want that.

04:47.663 --> 04:49.123
You have to hold still, sir...

04:49.332 --> 04:52.627
...otherwise I shall be smearing the makeup
on your cowl.

04:52.835 --> 04:55.004
Sorry, Alfred.

04:55.838 --> 04:59.967
There. You should look quite good
under the lights now, sir.

05:05.097 --> 05:06.766
How do you do, ladies and gentlemen?

05:06.974 --> 05:09.685
Station KGOM is very happy and proud...

05:09.894 --> 05:14.482
...to bring you a debate between the candidates
who are running for mayor of Gotham City.

05:14.690 --> 05:18.611
I believe the Penguin
will lead off the debate.

05:19.737 --> 05:21.781
Friends and fellow citizens...

05:22.198 --> 05:24.700
...I wanna give you my solemn word...

05:24.909 --> 05:28.454
...that there will be no mud-slinging
in this campaign...

05:28.663 --> 05:31.833
...unless, of course, my opponent slings it.

05:32.041 --> 05:35.211
But I intend to stick to the issues.

05:35.419 --> 05:37.255
Now, what are the issues?

05:37.463 --> 05:40.466
There is only one: Batman.

05:41.217 --> 05:42.510
Who is he?

05:42.718 --> 05:47.974
Who is this acrobatic clown
who somersaults around Gotham City...

05:48.182 --> 05:50.726
...in that ridiculous costume?

05:51.185 --> 05:57.525
<i>I suggest that behind that mask,
Batman is in reality...</i>

05:57.733 --> 05:59.527
<i>...a dangerous criminal.</i>

05:59.735 --> 06:01.779
Why else does he wear a mask?

06:01.988 --> 06:05.741
Why else does he conceal his past?

06:05.950 --> 06:08.119
Would you think about that
a moment, my friends?

06:08.870 --> 06:12.957
Whenever you've seen Batman,
who is he with?

06:13.165 --> 06:14.417
Criminals.

06:15.126 --> 06:16.460
That's who.

06:16.669 --> 06:19.046
You look in the old newspapers.

06:19.255 --> 06:21.674
Every picture of Batman...

06:21.883 --> 06:27.805
...shows him with thugs and with thieves
and hobnobbing with crooks.

06:28.014 --> 06:35.021
Whereas my pictures
show me always surrounded by whom?

06:35.271 --> 06:37.398
By the police.

06:37.607 --> 06:40.693
<i>I am associate of the law.</i>

06:40.902 --> 06:42.570
Listen to those lies.

06:42.778 --> 06:45.865
Oh, that Penguin, he's as crooked
as a warped shillelagh.

06:46.073 --> 06:50.202
Now, which man do you want
to run Gotham City?

06:50.411 --> 06:56.250
A man like myself, who is always
in the company of the law...

06:56.459 --> 06:58.252
...or a man like Batman...

06:58.461 --> 07:02.548
...who rubs elbows
with the worst elements of this city...

07:02.757 --> 07:07.345
...and who is undoubtedly
a desperate criminal himself?

07:07.553 --> 07:11.766
Think about it without rancor,
and remember this:

07:11.974 --> 07:16.062
No mud-slinging in this campaign.

07:16.270 --> 07:18.564
Yeah, Penguin, attaboy!

07:19.231 --> 07:20.983
Thank you very much.

07:21.192 --> 07:23.069
You bet.

07:23.277 --> 07:27.615
And now we should have a few words
from the other candidate.

07:27.823 --> 07:30.117
My fellow citizens...

07:31.744 --> 07:35.164
...let me begin by pointing out
some inconsistencies...

07:36.999 --> 07:43.965
...in <i>both the logic and the substance
of Mr. Penguin's preceding remarks.</i>

07:44.131 --> 07:46.050
<i>Vote Penguin, yes, sirree</i>

07:46.217 --> 07:49.303
<i>He's the vote for you and me
Clean up Gotham, one, two, three</i>

07:49.512 --> 07:51.847
What's going on?

07:53.224 --> 07:56.102
This is your doing,
you waddling pat politician.

07:56.310 --> 07:58.020
Tut-tut, Wonder Midget.

07:58.229 --> 08:00.564
Can I help it if I have enthusiastic fans?

08:00.773 --> 08:03.526
Besides, now the voters
won't be bored to death...

08:03.734 --> 08:07.571
...by Batman's babble. Hwah, hwah, hwah.

08:08.656 --> 08:11.534
<i>We interrupt this broadcast
for a special news flash.</i>

08:11.701 --> 08:15.871
<i>The Gotham City Convention Hall,
containing $2 million worth of displays...</i>

08:16.038 --> 08:18.165
<i>...for the forthcoming Jewelers Convention...</i>

08:18.374 --> 08:22.336
<i>...is being robbed by a gang of criminals
who have barricaded themselves inside...</i>

08:22.545 --> 08:25.131
Don't just stand there,
get down to Convention Hall.

08:25.339 --> 08:26.465
Right, commissioner.

08:26.674 --> 08:28.467
We better get right down there, Robin.

08:28.676 --> 08:31.762
Why, you two incompetents
will botch this job.

08:31.971 --> 08:34.097
Citizen Penguin to the rescue.

08:40.104 --> 08:44.191
This is Walter Klondike in the lobby
of Gotham City's Convention Hall...

08:44.400 --> 08:48.237
...where one of the greatest robberies
of all time is taking place right now.

08:48.446 --> 08:52.533
The two candidates for mayor have just gone
inside to help subdue the cutthroat gang...

08:52.700 --> 08:55.703
...that has kept Gotham City's
police force at bay.

08:55.911 --> 08:57.747
Oh, Chief O'Hara.

08:57.955 --> 09:00.124
Well, chief, how does it look to you now?

09:00.332 --> 09:02.084
Grim, that's how it looks.

09:02.293 --> 09:05.588
I only hope that Batman and Robin
get out of there alive.

09:05.796 --> 09:08.049
- Mm. How about the Penguin?
-Him? Why, that--!

09:08.257 --> 09:10.301
Thank you very much, Chief O'Hara.

09:10.509 --> 09:13.554
We now switch you to Chet Chumley
inside Convention Hall.

09:13.763 --> 09:14.889
Come in, Chet.

09:15.306 --> 09:16.724
Thank you, Walter.

09:16.932 --> 09:20.019
This is Chet Chumley
inside Convention Hall.

09:20.227 --> 09:25.691
From our post here high above the floor,
we can see the battle spread before us.

09:25.900 --> 09:31.238
And Batman, Robin, and the Penguin
are struggling furiously with the thugs...

09:31.405 --> 09:35.701
...who are attempting to make off
with over a million dollars in jewels.

09:45.669 --> 09:47.421
Well, not so fakey, you fink.

09:49.006 --> 09:52.551
Not so real.

10:00.184 --> 10:02.019
Well, that's all for Robin.

10:02.228 --> 10:04.772
Just leaves the two candidates.

10:04.939 --> 10:09.860
Uh, we switch now to David Dooley
down on the Convention floor. Come in, David.

10:10.027 --> 10:13.447
Thank you, Chet. This is
David Dooley on the Convention floor.

10:13.614 --> 10:17.368
I'll to maneuver over to Batman to see
if I can get him to say a few words to us.

10:17.535 --> 10:21.247
Is there anything at all you'd like to say
to the television audience, Batman?

10:27.294 --> 10:30.381
Of course, Batman, a little bit later.

10:30.589 --> 10:32.299
Thank you.

10:36.595 --> 10:39.515
This is David Dooley
on the Convention floor.

10:39.723 --> 10:42.560
I switch you back now to Chet Chumley.

10:42.768 --> 10:44.436
Take it away, Chet.

10:44.895 --> 10:46.188
Thank you, David.

10:46.397 --> 10:49.859
This is Chet Chumley
high above the Convention floor.

10:50.067 --> 10:53.863
The battle is raging hot and heavy
below us. Wait a minute.

11:16.969 --> 11:19.054
Batman got one.

11:24.560 --> 11:27.521
Now it looks like the Penguin
is about to get one.

11:29.565 --> 11:30.691
He did.

11:30.900 --> 11:33.110
Score one more for the Penguin.

11:33.319 --> 11:36.071
Well, it looks like the Penguin
is rolling up quite a lead.

11:36.280 --> 11:38.657
But it's still a tight contest.

11:38.866 --> 11:41.827
I think that, uh, David has maneuvered over
toward the Penguin now...

11:41.994 --> 11:46.332
...so we switch to the Convention floor
and David Dooley. Come in, David.

11:46.540 --> 11:48.083
Thank you, Chet.

11:48.292 --> 11:50.794
This is David Dooley
on the Convention floor.

11:51.003 --> 11:54.465
I'm going to see now if we can get
a few words from the other candidate.

11:54.673 --> 11:57.218
Is there anything you'd like to say
to our audience?

11:57.426 --> 12:03.015
Though I'm very busy right now,
David, as you can see...

12:03.224 --> 12:06.602
...bringing law and order back
to Gotham City...

12:06.810 --> 12:10.231
...I always have a few words to say
to the voters...

12:10.439 --> 12:12.399
...even when my own life is in danger.

12:12.608 --> 12:14.193
Where's the camera?

12:14.735 --> 12:17.196
Ladies and gentlemen,
friends of Gotham City...

12:17.404 --> 12:19.740
...you've seen both of the candidates
in action.

12:19.949 --> 12:24.662
And you can decide yourself which of us
is better able to run this glorious city.

12:24.870 --> 12:27.998
You seem to be putting more thugs
out of business than Batman.

12:28.207 --> 12:30.501
- How do you explain that?
-Proves that I'm right.

12:30.709 --> 12:33.045
Batman is in cahoots
with the criminal elements.

12:33.254 --> 12:36.799
- He's got one foot in the underground.
-Thank you for your opinion, Penguin.

12:44.765 --> 12:48.519
- Mr. Penguin.
<i>- I'll</i> teach you to defile our fair city.

12:49.561 --> 12:50.980
Penguin.

12:53.399 --> 12:55.567
- The Penguin.
-The Penguin.

13:03.867 --> 13:06.328
What a man. What a man.

13:06.537 --> 13:09.581
The Penguin has certainly gained
some political mileage today.

13:09.790 --> 13:11.458
Batman, are you all right?

13:11.667 --> 13:13.627
There were just too many for me, Robin.

13:13.836 --> 13:17.464
But somehow the Penguin
was knocking them down left and right.

13:17.673 --> 13:21.302
That whole thing was a setup, Batman.
That waddling weasel planned it.

13:21.468 --> 13:25.431
Perhaps, but I'm afraid we can't prove it.

13:29.977 --> 13:33.188
I guess nobody likes a loser.

13:33.564 --> 13:36.942
Well, that's the story from Convention Hall.

13:37.735 --> 13:41.071
- Good night, David.
-Good night, Chet.

13:45.868 --> 13:48.245
It's a black day for Gotham City.

13:48.412 --> 13:52.916
- I just talked to Gallus, Rooper and Trendek.
-How bad was it?

13:53.125 --> 13:59.089
The latest polls show
65 percent Penguin, 35 percent Batman.

13:59.298 --> 14:00.924
That's gratitude for you.

14:01.133 --> 14:03.886
After all that Batman has done
for our citizens.

14:04.094 --> 14:09.850
I think you underestimate
the good citizens of Gotham City, chief.

14:10.059 --> 14:12.519
But look at the poll, Batman.

14:12.728 --> 14:15.773
Elections are not won by polls,
commissioner.

14:15.981 --> 14:18.650
They're won by votes,
at least in this country.

14:19.318 --> 14:21.737
Sixty-five percent is a big margin, Batman.

14:22.112 --> 14:23.489
I know it looks grim, Robin...

14:23.697 --> 14:26.992
...but I wouldn't throw in the towel
until the votes are counted.

14:27.409 --> 14:29.953
Uh, the first returns
should be coming in now.

14:30.162 --> 14:31.955
<i>This is Walter Klondike.</i>

14:32.164 --> 14:35.459
<i>The first returns on the mayor's election
have just come in.</i>

14:35.667 --> 14:38.962
<i>As usual, the northeastern precincts
are reporting earliest.</i>

14:39.171 --> 14:45.386
<i>And the tally from the northeast
gives the Penguin 12,574...</i>

14:45.594 --> 14:48.931
<i>...and Batman 9682.</i>

14:50.974 --> 14:53.310
- Hello?
-Hello, commissioner.

14:53.519 --> 14:56.563
This is the next mayor
of Gotham City speaking.

14:56.772 --> 14:58.899
<i>What? Who is this?</i>

14:59.108 --> 15:02.152
No, I just wanted to tell you
not to worry about your job.

15:02.361 --> 15:05.864
See, I'm appointing the Riddler
new commissioner of police...

15:06.031 --> 15:08.367
...and he's promised
to give you back your old job.

15:08.575 --> 15:09.910
<i>WW, you pompous--</i>

15:10.119 --> 15:12.329
Oh, that's pounding the beat
on the waterfront.

15:12.538 --> 15:13.664
Why, you--

15:14.248 --> 15:18.794
- Listen, you malignant--
-Oh, tut-tut. No harsh words, please.

15:19.002 --> 15:21.755
Commissioner, I'll put you
in charge of cleaning sewers.

15:21.964 --> 15:25.426
- How dare you?
-And you tell that Irish stooge of yours...

15:25.634 --> 15:29.847
...that his next job will be shining the shoes
of the new police chief:

15:30.055 --> 15:31.432
The Joker.

15:36.019 --> 15:40.941
Terrible thing is, in a few short hours,
that mangy bird may be my boss.

15:41.150 --> 15:43.402
<i>Here's a new development,
ladies and gentlemen.</i>

15:43.610 --> 15:46.530
<i>Although the eastern precincts
went heavily for the Penguin...</i>

15:46.738 --> 15:50.492
<i>...the middle and western precincts
show a very strong Batman trend.</i>

15:50.993 --> 15:52.703
Western precincts?

15:52.911 --> 15:55.080
Batman is probably getting the Indian vote.

15:55.664 --> 15:59.418
<i>Penguin's lead has narrowed
to a few thousand, and continues to shrink.</i>

15:59.626 --> 16:02.629
<i>This election may still
have some few surprises in it.</i>

16:04.798 --> 16:07.050
You three blow-hards told me
I couldn't lose.

16:07.259 --> 16:09.261
- What's happening?
-The X factor.

16:09.470 --> 16:10.804
Random sampling error.

16:11.013 --> 16:13.056
Well, you better pray that my lead holds...

16:13.265 --> 16:18.145
...or you'll be taking random samplings
of river water from the bottom.

16:18.353 --> 16:21.273
-It's too good to be true.
-Shh. The returns.

16:21.482 --> 16:23.525
<i>Here are the latest reports.</i>

16:23.734 --> 16:26.069
<i>The Batman trend is continuing.</i>

16:26.278 --> 16:29.364
<i>The western precincts
have gone solidly for Batman.</i>

16:29.573 --> 16:34.495
<i>The Caped Candidate is now
to within 1000 votes of the Penguin.</i>

16:34.703 --> 16:37.706
You were the only one who really
had faith in the voters, Batman.

16:37.915 --> 16:41.126
- I'm ashamed of myself.
-We're all ashamed, Batman.

16:41.335 --> 16:44.171
We were ready to desert the ship,
you never lost your courage.

16:44.379 --> 16:47.007
You brought us safely through.

16:47.216 --> 16:49.801
I never would've believed
that the polls could be wrong.

16:50.010 --> 16:53.764
There have been other candidates
who have trusted too much to the polls.

16:53.972 --> 16:57.726
And they found out
that it's the votes that count.

16:57.935 --> 17:01.146
Smart politicians
trust the voters, not the polls.

17:01.355 --> 17:06.527
After all, if you can't trust the voters,
whom can you trust?

17:07.736 --> 17:11.448
Gotta win this election by hook or by crook.

17:11.656 --> 17:13.534
At least you have choices, Pengy.

17:13.742 --> 17:17.079
If you don't have a board of electors,
you can't count the votes.

17:17.287 --> 17:20.457
And if you can't count the votes,
you can't announce the winner.

17:20.665 --> 17:22.000
That s real sharp thinking.

17:22.209 --> 17:27.089
So hang the polls and hang the pollsters.

17:31.134 --> 17:34.596
I told you not to count those hobos
down at the freight yards.

17:34.805 --> 17:38.809
What about the two sword swallowers
and the lady wrestler you turned in?

17:39.017 --> 17:41.812
Nobody will ever listen to us again.

17:42.020 --> 17:46.984
Don't worry, we can always get a job
rating TV Shows.

17:49.945 --> 17:52.739
- Ha, ha. We're going to win.
-Saints be praised.

17:52.948 --> 17:55.993
You certainly taught me a few things
about politics, Batman.

17:58.579 --> 18:01.123
Hello? Oh, just a minute.

18:01.331 --> 18:03.083
- For you.
-Hello?

18:03.292 --> 18:05.586
The law says
that the votes must be counted...

18:05.794 --> 18:10.382
...only by a duly appointed
Board of Elections, Batman.

18:10.591 --> 18:15.846
<i>And it so happens that I have
the Board of Elections right here with me.</i>

18:16.054 --> 18:17.639
<i>All three of them.</i>

18:17.848 --> 18:21.560
And unless the city council meets
within one half an hour...

18:21.768 --> 18:24.855
...and proclaims me mayor of Gotham City...

18:25.063 --> 18:28.817
...they will be counting the votes
in a morgue.

18:29.359 --> 18:31.737
You forget about the Bat-trace of Batman.

18:31.945 --> 18:35.157
I'm not gonna be on the phone
long enough to let you trace the call.

18:35.365 --> 18:37.117
Good bye.

18:43.790 --> 18:47.336
The Penguin has kidnapped
the Board of Elections, Mayor Lindseed.

18:48.128 --> 18:49.713
Holy potluck.

18:49.921 --> 18:51.840
No, Robin, not at all.

18:52.049 --> 18:54.426
Even the Penguin hasn't unlimited funds.

18:54.635 --> 18:59.014
I suspect the campaign
has severely depleted his resources...

18:59.222 --> 19:04.770
...and he's holding his hostages in the
headquarters of that venerable organization...

19:04.936 --> 19:09.066
...the Grand Order of Occidental Nighthawks.

19:09.274 --> 19:10.901
Let's go.

19:14.988 --> 19:18.116
The half hour's up,
and nothing from Batman.

19:18.325 --> 19:23.038
I think my little grandstand play
has turned the tide.

19:23.288 --> 19:25.415
Turn the TV on again, Lulu.

19:25.624 --> 19:29.753
While we watch ex-mayor Hayseed
or whatever his name is...

19:29.961 --> 19:31.713
...proclaim me mayor.

19:31.922 --> 19:35.842
Oh, I am gonna wring the city dry.

19:36.051 --> 19:41.556
I'm gonna pick the bones of Gotham City
and throw the carcass to the finks.

19:43.225 --> 19:46.269
Aren't you being
a little premature, Penguin?

19:46.478 --> 19:47.854
How'd you find this place?

19:48.063 --> 19:49.439
You goofed, that's how.

19:49.648 --> 19:52.359
And no good mayor ever goofs.

19:52.567 --> 19:57.406
Particularly when he hasn't
even been elected yet.

19:57.614 --> 20:01.493
But I have the Board of Elections here.
They can't have counted any more votes.

20:01.702 --> 20:03.161
They didn't need to.

20:03.578 --> 20:06.832
This is some sort of a trick, that's what it is.

20:07.040 --> 20:13.004
Some sort of a low, scurvy,
underhanded, political sort of a trick.

20:13.213 --> 20:17.634
I'll have you reported
to the Fair Campaign Practices Committee.

20:17.843 --> 20:19.469
No, PengY-

20:19.678 --> 20:21.972
You said we associated with criminals.

20:22.180 --> 20:24.141
So here we are.

20:24.349 --> 20:25.684
Attack.

20:47.622 --> 20:51.626
I thought you bought the machine
to turn out your campaign literature, Pengy.

20:51.835 --> 20:54.004
Look what it's turning out now.

20:56.882 --> 20:59.426
I see it. And it's not literature.

21:01.470 --> 21:03.638
I'm getting out of here
before they package me.

21:03.847 --> 21:05.849
- You'd better too.
-No.

21:06.057 --> 21:08.018
Batman wouldn't dare touch me.

21:08.226 --> 21:11.313
Think what it would do to his public image.

21:17.861 --> 21:22.115
Remember, remember, I'm a candidate
for the mayor of Gotham City.

21:22.324 --> 21:24.910
You lay hands on me,
and I'll have the voters after you.

21:25.118 --> 21:28.163
Keep your distance.
Keep your distance, I say.

21:28.371 --> 21:29.915
Keep your distance.

21:30.123 --> 21:32.375
I think it's time for us
to wrap up the election.

21:32.584 --> 21:35.253
I take it you mean wrap up the candidate.

21:35.462 --> 21:36.797
Oh, exactly.

21:36.963 --> 21:42.511
Aah! Blast it, I'm a political candidate!

21:53.855 --> 21:56.316
Hwah, hwah, hwah.

22:05.867 --> 22:07.577
In case you're interested, Penguin...

22:07.744 --> 22:10.288
...Batman won the election
by an overwhelming margin.

22:10.497 --> 22:13.333
The votes were already counted
when you kidnapped the Board.

22:13.542 --> 22:15.710
Faugh, it's a fraud, I say.

22:15.919 --> 22:18.046
I demand a recount.

22:18.255 --> 22:21.591
Don't worry,
you'll have another chance soon.

22:21.800 --> 22:26.513
The Convicts Committee
for Clean Prison Government...

22:26.721 --> 22:28.890
...is having an election next week.

22:29.099 --> 22:34.396
You should arrive just in time
to run for chairman.

22:34.604 --> 22:38.275
And if you need any endorsements, uh,
just let us know.

22:38.441 --> 22:40.735
Hwah, hwah, hwah.

22:43.154 --> 22:47.033
I demand my constitutional rights.
Hwah, hwah.

22:52.205 --> 22:55.292
Now that I've resigned
in favor of Mayor Lindseed...

22:55.500 --> 22:58.795
...Gotham City will be back in good hands
for another four years.

22:59.004 --> 23:02.173
And if nothing else,
Robin got a good lesson in civics.

23:02.382 --> 23:04.551
Oh, I had enough experience
to last me forever.

23:04.759 --> 23:07.637
You can never have too much experience
in politics, Robin...

23:07.846 --> 23:10.891
...as many politicians have discovered.

23:13.059 --> 23:14.519
Yes?

23:15.645 --> 23:19.190
Why, yes, he's right here.

23:19.399 --> 23:22.777
- Batman, for you.
-Thank you.

23:23.778 --> 23:25.405
Batman.

23:28.033 --> 23:29.618
Thank you very much.

23:29.826 --> 23:33.538
I'm flattered that your committee
should be interested in me...

23:33.747 --> 23:36.374
...as a presidential candidate for 1968...

23:36.583 --> 23:41.796
...but I'm afraid my Gotham City duties
take precedence.

23:42.088 --> 23:47.218
Yes, I will definitely let you know
if I change my mind.

23:49.721 --> 23:51.556
Well.

23:51.765 --> 23:54.517
Bulging ballot boxes, Batman,
that was some offer.

23:54.726 --> 23:57.646
And you ain't even a general, Batman.

23:57.854 --> 24:00.148
Anyway, it was nice of them to call.

24:02.192 --> 24:03.735
Yes?

24:04.152 --> 24:05.320
Hold on, just a moment.

24:05.528 --> 24:07.739
Batman, another call.

24:11.534 --> 24:12.786
Yes, Batman.

24:14.704 --> 24:17.457
I'm flattered, gentlemen...

24:17.666 --> 24:22.629
...but I thought your party had
a candidate for 1968.

24:25.215 --> 24:29.052
