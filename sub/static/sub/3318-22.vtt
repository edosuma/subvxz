WEBVTT

00:01.001 --> 00:03.035
<i>Previously on</i> reign:

00:03.037 --> 00:05.437
Have you seen him?
Have you seen the darkness?

00:05.439 --> 00:07.373
I was born a pagan.

00:07.375 --> 00:09.575
Is that why you've
taken this on?

00:09.577 --> 00:11.110
Because you feel some blame

00:11.112 --> 00:12.444
For the blood spilled
by this faith?

00:12.446 --> 00:14.046
(trembling):
Leave...

00:14.048 --> 00:14.747
Me alone.

00:14.749 --> 00:16.315
Catherine:
<i>He is mad,</i>

00:16.317 --> 00:18.150
<i>And a mad king incites</i>
<i>chaos and rebellion.</i>

00:18.152 --> 00:19.451
Francis:
<i>He listened to me.</i>

00:19.453 --> 00:21.186
<i>His sanity started trickling</i>

00:21.188 --> 00:22.287
<i>Back in, and for a moment</i>

00:22.289 --> 00:23.589
I could actually
see my father again.

00:23.591 --> 00:26.058
Henry:
<i>I must kill my son</i>

00:26.060 --> 00:27.459
And wed his wife.

00:31.765 --> 00:34.500
Woman:
What's happening?

00:34.502 --> 00:37.036
Boy:
I'm frightened.
I don't want to go!

00:37.038 --> 00:39.104
Girl:
Is the king angry again?

00:39.106 --> 00:41.173
What's going on?
Is the castle under attack?

00:41.175 --> 00:43.042
The king has summoned everyone
to the courtyard.

00:43.044 --> 00:44.209
Urgently.

00:47.447 --> 00:49.081
What's this about?

00:49.083 --> 00:51.250
Greer:
I don't know,
but I fear the worst.

00:54.120 --> 00:56.622
One or more of you here,

00:56.624 --> 00:58.424
My friends, my family...

00:58.426 --> 01:00.225
My subjects...

01:00.227 --> 01:01.593
Tried to kill me.

01:01.595 --> 01:03.595
I have taken steps.

01:03.597 --> 01:05.130
You have seen my new men,

01:05.132 --> 01:07.099
Modeled after the
praetorian guard

01:07.101 --> 01:09.068
Of the roman emperors;

01:09.070 --> 01:11.103
Loyal only to me.

01:11.105 --> 01:13.205
But I knew more
needed to be done.

01:13.207 --> 01:14.573
The guilty revealed.

01:14.575 --> 01:15.774
And this night...

01:15.776 --> 01:17.209
In a dream...

01:17.211 --> 01:18.744
God told me how.

01:18.746 --> 01:20.612
My oath to him:

01:20.614 --> 01:22.614
This sword...

01:22.616 --> 01:23.849
Will not be sheathed

01:23.851 --> 01:26.351
Till it has taken a life.

01:26.353 --> 01:29.254
As the sun rises,
this sword will cast a shadow.

01:29.256 --> 01:31.223
When that shadow
touches the guilty...

01:31.225 --> 01:33.125
I'll know.

01:42.635 --> 01:44.236
(panting)

01:46.639 --> 01:48.140
Not now.

01:48.142 --> 01:50.242
Give them time
to tell their sins

01:50.244 --> 01:52.377
And due penance.

01:52.379 --> 01:54.746
Let their souls be wiped clean;

01:54.748 --> 01:57.149
God likes that best.

01:57.151 --> 02:00.819
Everyone wants to confess.

02:00.821 --> 02:04.723
(rooster crowing)

02:04.725 --> 02:07.292
Who here...

02:07.294 --> 02:10.329
Made their confession
yesterday?

02:10.331 --> 02:11.563
I did.

02:13.233 --> 02:14.666
Travers, my lord.

02:14.668 --> 02:16.735
Secretary to lord bellamy.

02:16.737 --> 02:18.203
(henry panting)

02:18.205 --> 02:21.206
Did you fornicate last night?

02:21.208 --> 02:22.841
Or take the lord's name in vain?

02:22.843 --> 02:25.244
Of course not, my lord.

02:25.246 --> 02:27.446
We should all be
as ready as you.

02:29.249 --> 02:30.282
(women scream)

02:30.284 --> 02:32.918
(grunting, gasping)

02:32.920 --> 02:34.853
(choking)

02:34.855 --> 02:37.189
(henry panting)

02:39.259 --> 02:40.425
Be off.

02:40.427 --> 02:42.261
Don your finest clothing.

02:42.263 --> 02:44.229
The celebrations
of our victory at calais

02:44.231 --> 02:45.531
Will reach their peak.

02:45.533 --> 02:48.333
Clean that.

02:50.870 --> 02:52.905
I was wrong.

02:52.907 --> 02:54.640
He is lost.

03:02.348 --> 03:04.349
All the time I was growing up,

03:04.351 --> 03:06.518
I saw him as
the greatest man in France.

03:09.489 --> 03:12.524
I'm sorry, francis.

03:12.526 --> 03:15.194
It's too late for assassination;
we'd never get near him.

03:15.196 --> 03:17.362
He must be
removed from the throne

03:17.364 --> 03:18.597
By a superior force.

03:18.599 --> 03:20.199
A coup?

03:20.201 --> 03:21.800
It's deadly for us
if we lose

03:21.802 --> 03:23.802
And dangerous if we win.

03:23.804 --> 03:25.204
A coup puts power
in the hands of the military.

03:25.206 --> 03:26.939
We have no choice.

03:26.941 --> 03:28.507
But how?
What can I offer

03:28.509 --> 03:30.309
The generals to back me,
rather than father?

03:30.311 --> 03:32.311
I can give them
no more reward than he.

03:32.313 --> 03:36.648
Some generals were dismissed
before calais.

03:36.650 --> 03:38.217
Surely, they feel betrayed
by their king.

03:38.219 --> 03:40.285
And each one of them
is a noble with a territory

03:40.287 --> 03:41.353
And men of their own to command.

03:41.355 --> 03:42.988
It could work.

03:42.990 --> 03:44.289
But if we win,

03:44.291 --> 03:45.891
If we seize power...

03:45.893 --> 03:48.327
What happens to your father?

03:48.329 --> 03:50.395
He will be imprisoned,

03:50.397 --> 03:52.231
See the finest doctors,
and in time

03:52.233 --> 03:53.465
Either he will
regain his senses

03:53.467 --> 03:55.334
Or he will die
a natural death, but...

03:55.336 --> 03:56.535
He can never be king again.

03:56.537 --> 03:58.904
His time will be over...

03:58.906 --> 04:01.373
And you will rule beside me.

04:06.346 --> 04:07.479
Kenna:
<i>Pascal.</i>

04:07.481 --> 04:08.780
<i>What is it, what's wrong?</i>

04:08.782 --> 04:10.415
I've had a nightmare.

04:10.417 --> 04:12.251
I saw him...

04:12.253 --> 04:14.453
Outside the window,
staring at us.

04:21.294 --> 04:22.894
(man speaking indistinctly)

04:22.896 --> 04:24.329
Kenna:
You see?

04:24.331 --> 04:26.665
The guards that
bash sent are here.

04:26.667 --> 04:29.401
You're safe.
It was just a dream.

04:31.904 --> 04:34.439
<i>Bash will return</i>
<i>from visegard soon.</i>

04:34.441 --> 04:36.441
And when he finds the darkness,

04:36.443 --> 04:38.844
<i>We'll make sure</i>
<i>he never threatens you</i>

04:38.846 --> 04:40.746
<i>Or anyone else ever again.</i>

04:40.748 --> 04:42.714
(indistinct chatter)

04:47.587 --> 04:49.354
Your wounds have healed, I see.

04:49.356 --> 04:51.790
Well, I found no more excuses
to stay in bed.

04:51.792 --> 04:53.325
I also, um...

04:53.327 --> 04:54.960
I found this.
Ah.

04:54.962 --> 04:57.029
It's a deed to lands

04:57.031 --> 04:58.397
That include farms,

04:58.399 --> 04:59.798
Orchards,
a manor house.

04:59.800 --> 05:01.533
How could I ever thank you?

05:01.535 --> 05:03.402
This is more than
I could have ever dreamed...

05:03.404 --> 05:04.736
You saved my life.

05:04.738 --> 05:06.471
I only regret that
I couldn't give you a title,

05:06.473 --> 05:07.439
But that is the king's job
and my father is...

05:07.441 --> 05:09.608
These are dark hours;

05:09.610 --> 05:11.376
It is not a good time
to ask for such a thing.

05:11.378 --> 05:13.045
We must share a drink.

05:13.047 --> 05:14.513
I have something
important to attend to.

05:14.515 --> 05:16.448
Another time?

05:16.450 --> 05:19.685
Oh, good luck with that girl
that you told me about.

05:19.687 --> 05:22.487
If she doesn't wed you now,
she's a fool.

05:26.793 --> 05:28.327
Montgomery:
I brought you that drink.

05:28.329 --> 05:30.062
Don't you think
you owe me a smile?

05:30.064 --> 05:31.430
I didn't ask for the drink.

05:31.432 --> 05:33.332
Feel free to take it back.

05:33.334 --> 05:34.399
Montgomery:
You're making
an enormous mistake,

05:34.401 --> 05:35.701
You rich tart.

05:35.703 --> 05:36.968
I am in the king's
personal guard.

05:36.970 --> 05:38.403
So you'd better start
being nice to me,

05:38.405 --> 05:40.472
If you know what's best...
Leith:
Darling!

05:40.474 --> 05:42.374
Sorry I'm late.

05:42.376 --> 05:44.376
It's all right.

05:44.378 --> 05:45.944
This gentleman
was just keeping me amused.

05:45.946 --> 05:46.978
Well...

05:46.980 --> 05:48.647
Only the best

05:48.649 --> 05:50.382
For the heroes of calais...

05:50.384 --> 05:52.718
Right?

05:55.088 --> 05:57.356
Sorry for intruding.

05:57.358 --> 05:58.957
I can tell when somebody's
being pushed into something

05:58.959 --> 06:01.460
That they don't want to do;
I've seen too much of it.

06:01.462 --> 06:02.994
In the army, you mean?

06:02.996 --> 06:04.730
All my life.

06:04.732 --> 06:06.798
Have a drink with me
and tell me about it.

06:06.800 --> 06:10.836
I... I'd love to, but, uh...

06:10.838 --> 06:12.804
I-- truth is,
I'm-I'm looking for someone.

06:12.806 --> 06:16.775
Those are the saddest words
I've heard all day.

06:21.681 --> 06:26.485
Your majesty,
I've done as you wished.

06:26.487 --> 06:28.754
The matter of the
additional spice to be added

06:28.756 --> 06:33.058
To the dauphin's plate,
have you changed your mind?

06:33.060 --> 06:34.526
No.

06:34.528 --> 06:37.729
I want it done
at tonight's feast.

06:39.165 --> 06:43.034
Don't be concerned
about the sin.

06:43.036 --> 06:46.538
I reconciled with god
for us both.

06:46.540 --> 06:49.174
See his plate
is piled high with meats.

06:49.176 --> 06:50.509
To those watching,
it will look as though

06:50.511 --> 06:51.777
Francis choked to death.

06:55.515 --> 06:58.417
Oh! And tell them
to leave up the garlands.

06:58.419 --> 07:00.018
I'm planning
a wedding here...

07:00.020 --> 07:03.622
In the near future.
(sniffs)

07:11.197 --> 07:12.798
<i>If</i> I can sway
the generals to my side,

07:12.800 --> 07:15.100
I shall return with them
and their men beside me.

07:15.102 --> 07:16.868
Will that be enough?

07:16.870 --> 07:18.637
If the duke of guise
sets his forces against us...

07:18.639 --> 07:20.172
He is a cautious man.

07:20.174 --> 07:21.473
Perhaps he'll wait to
see who wins this...

07:21.475 --> 07:22.941
Well!

07:22.943 --> 07:24.943
Two happy couples
on a happy day, hmm?

07:24.945 --> 07:26.645
Mary,

07:26.647 --> 07:28.613
Aren't you coming
to see the joust

07:28.615 --> 07:29.981
And the naval spectacle?

07:29.983 --> 07:31.116
"spectacle"?

07:31.118 --> 07:32.150
Two ships

07:32.152 --> 07:33.185
In mock combat.

07:33.187 --> 07:35.554
It will be a wonder.

07:35.556 --> 07:37.556
And you...
Are the guest of honor.

07:37.558 --> 07:38.957
Me?

07:38.959 --> 07:40.592
Oh, henry insists, my dear.

07:41.828 --> 07:43.862
Oh, of course, I'm honored.

07:43.864 --> 07:46.698
I regret we haven't been
as close as we should.

07:46.700 --> 07:48.500
I may have been
a bit judgmental

07:48.502 --> 07:49.968
In your behavior
with my sons

07:49.970 --> 07:51.203
And about your
lack of an heir...

07:51.205 --> 07:52.804
With francis.

07:52.806 --> 07:54.239
As it turns out,

07:54.241 --> 07:55.507
God's plan there may be...

07:55.509 --> 07:56.875
For the best, after all.

07:58.911 --> 08:00.812
I should go.
But, you can't.

08:00.814 --> 08:02.214
You're not just
a hero of calais,

08:02.216 --> 08:03.915
You led the invasion.

08:03.917 --> 08:06.651
I am looking in at some
of the injured soldiers

08:06.653 --> 08:08.553
Who couldn't be here today.

08:08.555 --> 08:10.755
But you will be back
for the feast... Tonight?

08:10.757 --> 08:12.958
Of course.
Hmm.

08:17.063 --> 08:18.964
Shall we?

08:21.567 --> 08:23.602
(door knocking)

08:23.604 --> 08:25.537
Come in!

08:25.539 --> 08:26.805
Could you put the tray

08:26.807 --> 08:27.906
On the table over there?

08:27.908 --> 08:29.241
I could,

08:29.243 --> 08:31.610
But I don't have a tray.

08:31.612 --> 08:32.744
Should I go find one?

08:32.746 --> 08:33.778
(laughing):
Leith.

08:33.780 --> 08:34.946
Thank god.

08:34.948 --> 08:36.882
I heard you were alive, but...

08:38.017 --> 08:39.551
What's this?

08:39.553 --> 08:41.553
My land.

08:41.555 --> 08:42.821
Look at the map.

08:42.823 --> 08:44.956
Look at the list of holdings.

08:44.958 --> 08:46.625
Farms, tenants paying rent!

08:46.627 --> 08:48.527
River access, orchards,
a manor house.

08:48.529 --> 08:50.529
(laughing):
I don't understand.

08:50.531 --> 08:52.130
I'm a hero of calais, greer.

08:52.132 --> 08:53.965
I saved the dauphin's life.

08:53.967 --> 08:56.968
Francis calls me his <i>friend.</i>

08:56.970 --> 08:59.571
This is wonderful.

08:59.573 --> 09:02.207
♪ I feel her filth
in my bones... ♪

09:02.209 --> 09:04.009
But it...

09:04.011 --> 09:06.244
It can't change anything.

09:06.246 --> 09:07.846
I'm engaged
to lord castleroy.

09:07.848 --> 09:09.848
Wha-- I'm-I'm a rich man.
You

09:09.850 --> 09:12.784
Are a... A comfortable man.

09:12.786 --> 09:14.719
But this w...

09:14.721 --> 09:15.854
Would not clear a tenth

09:15.856 --> 09:17.556
Of my father's debts.

09:17.558 --> 09:19.558
It wouldn't provide my sisters
with dowries.

09:19.560 --> 09:20.659
My father would sell them

09:20.661 --> 09:22.727
To the highest bidder.

09:22.729 --> 09:24.729
Well, they...
Well, they could live with us!

09:24.731 --> 09:27.032
(voice breaking):
You don't understand
how people like us live!

09:28.701 --> 09:30.602
My sisters belong to my father;

09:30.604 --> 09:31.736
They're his property!

09:31.738 --> 09:33.605
He'd never agree
to let them move to--

09:33.607 --> 09:35.707
What he'd see as some...

09:37.244 --> 09:40.712
Where they would never find
appropriate suitors.

09:40.714 --> 09:42.647
I get the idea.

09:42.649 --> 09:44.683
(crying):
Please understand.

09:44.685 --> 09:46.585
I'm... Due in the harbor.

09:46.587 --> 09:48.219
They want me to...

09:48.221 --> 09:50.722
Join some other veterans
on the ship; some kind of...

09:50.724 --> 09:52.691
Naval spectacle.
(sighs)

09:52.693 --> 09:54.693
Apparently,
there are people who

09:54.695 --> 09:56.695
Consider today a celebration.

09:56.697 --> 09:58.830
I don't want to part like this!

09:58.832 --> 10:00.832
♪ angie, come back to bed...
(sighs)

10:00.834 --> 10:05.170
Greer, at some point,
you have to stop piling

10:05.172 --> 10:07.072
All of your family's problems
on your back.

10:07.074 --> 10:09.608
You have to take a risk.

10:09.610 --> 10:12.177
You have to trust love and fate

10:12.179 --> 10:14.179
And me.

10:14.181 --> 10:18.683
♪ when you're feeling
like that ♪

10:18.685 --> 10:19.951

10:19.953 --> 10:23.722

out of there. ♪

10:27.860 --> 10:29.794
(knocking on door)

10:30.763 --> 10:32.797
Uh, I beg your pardon, ma'am.

10:32.799 --> 10:34.366
My carriage is in the road.

10:34.368 --> 10:36.267
I'm taking a noblewoman
back to the castle,

10:36.269 --> 10:37.869
And she has gone into labor.

10:37.871 --> 10:39.204
Uh, my lady,

10:39.206 --> 10:40.939
You should've waited
for me to get you.

10:40.941 --> 10:42.140
Hey, what are you doing?

10:42.142 --> 10:43.341
I can't help you!

10:43.343 --> 10:44.709
I'm not a midwife.

10:44.711 --> 10:47.812
I can reimburse you
for your trouble.

10:47.814 --> 10:50.682
What reimbursement will help me
if this lady dies on my hands?

10:50.684 --> 10:51.850
Or her babe, and all of France

10:51.852 --> 10:52.951
Will blame me.

10:52.953 --> 10:54.319
(groans)

10:54.321 --> 10:55.720
(gasps)

10:55.722 --> 10:57.122
(fanfare plays)

10:57.124 --> 10:58.723
(crowd cheering)

10:58.725 --> 11:01.292
Announcer:
His majesty king henry
of France.

11:01.294 --> 11:05.430
Her majesty
mary, queen of scots.

11:05.432 --> 11:08.833
Her majesty
catherine, queen of France.

11:08.835 --> 11:11.302
Turn your eyes on a
display of french might.

11:11.304 --> 11:13.938
A spectacle to honor

11:13.940 --> 11:15.440
The heroes of calais.

11:15.442 --> 11:17.075
(applause)

11:17.077 --> 11:19.944
Each ship is full of soldiers

11:19.946 --> 11:21.846
Just returned from our victory.

11:21.848 --> 11:22.847
Long live the king!

11:22.849 --> 11:25.417
Wait till you see the fireworks.

11:25.419 --> 11:26.851
God bless you,
your majesty!

11:26.853 --> 11:28.086
Is there anything I can get you,
my dear?

11:28.088 --> 11:30.088
Some warm...

11:30.090 --> 11:31.790
Mulled wine?

11:31.792 --> 11:33.124
No, thank you.

11:33.126 --> 11:34.325
I'm fine.
Ah.

11:35.428 --> 11:37.262
Leith came to see me.

11:37.264 --> 11:38.396
I made it clear

11:38.398 --> 11:40.131
To him that we're over,

11:40.133 --> 11:42.167
That I'm marrying you,
that you're my future.

11:42.169 --> 11:44.069
(exhales)

11:44.071 --> 11:47.405
You must allow me to be relieved
in not losing the woman I love.

11:54.180 --> 11:55.947
(cannon shots)

11:55.949 --> 11:59.017
Castleroy:
They're firing cannons.

11:59.019 --> 12:00.251
How strange.

12:00.253 --> 12:02.087
I thought
they were using fireworks.

12:02.089 --> 12:03.755
It must be safe enough,

12:03.757 --> 12:05.023
As long as they don't
point at each other.

12:05.025 --> 12:07.425
Well, cannons can be hard
to control.

12:07.427 --> 12:09.094
The sound of victory.

12:09.096 --> 12:10.895
The sound of France.

12:10.897 --> 12:13.765
Doesn't that excite you?

12:17.403 --> 12:19.337
(cannon fires)

12:19.339 --> 12:21.072
(screaming)

12:21.074 --> 12:23.074
(gasping)

12:23.076 --> 12:25.009
My god, leith is on
one of those ships.

12:25.011 --> 12:26.878
Those who aren't blown to bits
won't survive.

12:26.880 --> 12:29.013
The water's freezing.
I told them to fire with care!

12:29.015 --> 12:31.182
Who's manning the guns,
a pet monkey?

12:31.184 --> 12:33.451
Wait, you actually told them
to fire the cannons?

12:33.453 --> 12:34.953
What kind of spectacle

12:34.955 --> 12:37.455
Would mere fireworks
have been, hmm?

12:37.457 --> 12:41.292
Well, never mind.

12:41.294 --> 12:43.061
I refuse to have
you disappointed, mary.

12:43.063 --> 12:44.929
This...

12:44.931 --> 12:47.832
Is all for you, you know.

12:47.834 --> 12:49.801
There'll be another
chance tomorrow.
Tomorrow?

12:49.803 --> 12:51.970
When we'll do it again!
Properly this time!

13:00.780 --> 13:02.914
A hundred men dead like that.

13:02.916 --> 13:04.516
Life so carelessly taken.

13:04.518 --> 13:06.484
I feel like I'm the one
losing my mind.

13:06.486 --> 13:08.953
Mary, there's something
you should know.

13:10.823 --> 13:13.024
Henry asked for an annulment
once more.

13:13.026 --> 13:15.827
It can only mean he wishes
to end our marriage

13:15.829 --> 13:17.829
And turn to someone else.

13:17.831 --> 13:19.030
You.

13:19.032 --> 13:20.231
No.

13:20.233 --> 13:22.133
I saw what he did to you.

13:22.135 --> 13:23.902
That came out of nowhere.

13:23.904 --> 13:26.237
He's never shown
the slightest bit of interest.

13:26.239 --> 13:28.907
When he had his hands on you,
he had his hands on England.

13:30.042 --> 13:31.910
So he's decided to wed me,

13:31.912 --> 13:33.912
Then keep all three crowns
for himself.

13:33.914 --> 13:35.313
Thus his suddenly
generous acceptance

13:35.315 --> 13:37.081
Of the fact
that you are not pregnant...

13:37.083 --> 13:38.917
Yet.

13:38.919 --> 13:40.585
He wants to give you
an heir himself.

13:40.587 --> 13:42.987
And the spectacle,
the carnage...

13:42.989 --> 13:45.523
Botched display of his prowess.
Does he honestly think

13:45.525 --> 13:47.892
That francis and I would agree
to have our marriage annulled?

13:47.894 --> 13:49.894
It's ridiculous!

13:49.896 --> 13:52.463
(gasps)

13:54.600 --> 13:55.967
No.

13:55.969 --> 13:57.035
Even he wouldn't.

13:57.037 --> 14:00.071
He's going to kill his own son!

14:01.974 --> 14:03.241
If you're right,

14:03.243 --> 14:04.576
Our only chance

14:04.578 --> 14:06.110
Is to overtake him
and his guards.

14:06.112 --> 14:08.413
Assuming that francis
is able to persuade the generals

14:08.415 --> 14:09.914
To join us in a coup.

14:09.916 --> 14:11.583
If francis comes back

14:11.585 --> 14:13.484
At the head of an army,
we'll know he succeeded.

14:13.486 --> 14:15.019
If he comes back alone,

14:15.021 --> 14:16.588
We have no protection
from henry,

14:16.590 --> 14:18.022
And neither does francis.

14:21.594 --> 14:23.094
(horse snorts)

14:32.905 --> 14:34.138
(horse neighs)
you there,

14:34.140 --> 14:35.340
What's this?

14:35.342 --> 14:36.574
What is this?

14:37.910 --> 14:39.544
What happened here?

14:39.546 --> 14:42.046
I beg of you, speak freely.

14:42.048 --> 14:44.616
The greatest naval spectacle
of all time, my lord.

14:44.618 --> 14:46.451
That is, until
the ship exploded.

14:46.453 --> 14:48.620
The king replaced the
fireworks with gunpowder.

14:48.622 --> 14:50.154
Can you believe they
survived calais for this?

14:50.156 --> 14:51.956
These soldiers are from calais?

14:51.958 --> 14:54.125
There'll be twice as many
tomorrow when they do it again.

14:54.127 --> 14:55.960
That's impossible.

14:55.962 --> 14:57.896
No one would do this again.
Begging your pardon,

14:57.898 --> 14:59.230
But you would think no one

14:59.232 --> 15:00.932
Would do it the first
time, wouldn't you?

15:00.934 --> 15:02.267
Still, you've got to wonder

15:02.269 --> 15:03.534
Who's worse off,

15:03.536 --> 15:04.969
These poor fellows

15:04.971 --> 15:06.471
Or the ones shipping
off for England.

15:08.007 --> 15:09.140
At least for them
it was quick.

15:09.142 --> 15:10.308
No one is shipping out.

15:10.310 --> 15:11.643
King's orders.

15:11.645 --> 15:13.111
Tell that to the 3,000 men

15:13.113 --> 15:14.379
Leaving tomorrow night.

15:18.017 --> 15:20.285
Christian:
You want me to join a coup?

15:20.287 --> 15:22.587
Mary: You may have
henry's favor today,

15:22.589 --> 15:24.422
But it can't last.

15:24.424 --> 15:26.491
The king's behavior is getting
more erratic every day.

15:26.493 --> 15:28.493
News of his madness will spread,

15:28.495 --> 15:30.094
Contenders for the throne
will appear,

15:30.096 --> 15:32.931
And civil war will follow,
one way or another.

15:32.933 --> 15:35.033
And I can't disagree
with your logic,

15:35.035 --> 15:37.001
But we lack
one essential element

15:37.003 --> 15:38.002
For a successful coup.

15:38.004 --> 15:39.938
A leader ready and at hand

15:39.940 --> 15:41.973
To fill the power vacuum
once the king is gone.

15:41.975 --> 15:43.975
Well, francis will be
the leader, obviously.

15:43.977 --> 15:45.410
He'll be the next king.

15:45.412 --> 15:47.946
Francis carries the stain
of his father's mistakes.

15:47.948 --> 15:50.348
He represents everything
the coup would be against.

15:50.350 --> 15:53.418
We need someone the nobles and
the nation can rally around.

15:53.420 --> 15:57.322
You, mary, bring
the promise of empire.

15:57.324 --> 16:01.059
Use the promise
that someday soon,

16:01.061 --> 16:03.428
England and all its power
and riches will be yours.

16:03.430 --> 16:05.229
Use this to make yourself

16:05.231 --> 16:08.232
The most powerful person
in France.

16:08.234 --> 16:10.268
More powerful than my husband?

16:10.270 --> 16:12.570
If you want to lay claim
to a nation,

16:12.572 --> 16:15.473
Take France.

16:19.044 --> 16:20.745
Bash:
<i>Why would the darkness</i>

16:20.747 --> 16:22.747
<i>Bring a young boy</i>
<i>to this place?</i>

16:22.749 --> 16:24.515
Every house deserted.

16:24.517 --> 16:26.351
What happened to these people?

16:26.353 --> 16:28.619
The area was beset
by flood a year ago.

16:28.621 --> 16:30.154
The town sits on higher ground.

16:30.156 --> 16:32.223
Why did no one settle here?

16:34.994 --> 16:36.127
(groaning)

16:36.129 --> 16:37.161
Not entirely deserted.

16:40.065 --> 16:41.532
The family that
once lived here.

16:41.534 --> 16:44.369
From the stench, I'd say
there was another victim.

16:47.172 --> 16:48.473
Pascal's scarf.

16:54.113 --> 16:55.713
Oh.

16:57.316 --> 16:59.183
This sacrifice is fresh,

16:59.185 --> 17:00.618
A few days old.

17:00.620 --> 17:03.221
This is where the blood
on pascal came from.

17:05.190 --> 17:07.692
From the dirt, these picture
have been here a long time.

17:07.694 --> 17:11.062
A storm...

17:11.064 --> 17:13.097
Fire...

17:14.133 --> 17:16.034
...Flood.
Disasters.

17:16.036 --> 17:18.136
But why draw them here?
I think they may
be depictions

17:18.138 --> 17:20.338
Of actual events that occurred
in this region.

17:20.340 --> 17:21.539
The great storm?

17:21.541 --> 17:23.107
Nearly two decades ago.

17:23.109 --> 17:25.043
Years later, the fire that raged

17:25.045 --> 17:26.511
Destroyed angers
and the nearby forests.

17:26.513 --> 17:30.048
The flood that wiped out
the surrounding areas.

17:30.050 --> 17:31.582
And the blackening of the sun.

17:31.584 --> 17:33.651
The eclipse so
recently witnessed.

17:33.653 --> 17:35.086
Are these predictions?

17:35.088 --> 17:36.721
Accurate predictions.

17:36.723 --> 17:38.689
What does this one mean?

17:38.691 --> 17:41.426
Stars falling from the sky.

17:41.428 --> 17:43.094
I don't know,

17:43.096 --> 17:45.496
But it's
the only one left.

17:47.766 --> 17:49.400
It's a pagan rhyme.

17:49.402 --> 17:51.169
I heard pascal chanting
it to himself.

17:51.171 --> 17:52.770
"I lie behind
the star-bright sky.

17:52.772 --> 17:54.238
"I do not fear
this life's good-bye.

17:54.240 --> 17:56.307
Close your eyes
for my caress..."

18:00.179 --> 18:02.313
"...For I am the darkness."

18:05.651 --> 18:09.087
"I lie behind
the star-bright sky.

18:09.089 --> 18:11.189
I do not fear this
life's good-bye."

18:11.191 --> 18:13.858
Pascal, why are you saying
that rhyme again?

18:13.860 --> 18:15.293
Are you scared?

18:19.298 --> 18:22.133
It's too quiet.

18:22.135 --> 18:24.202
Where are the guards?

18:34.113 --> 18:35.246
(screaming)

18:36.615 --> 18:38.816
Come on! Come on!

18:38.818 --> 18:40.885
Come on!

18:48.227 --> 18:49.560
Come on!

18:49.562 --> 18:51.329
(screams)

18:51.331 --> 18:53.598
(grunting)

18:54.366 --> 18:55.533
(shouts)

18:55.535 --> 18:57.802
(screams)

18:57.804 --> 18:59.170
(gasps) get back!

18:59.404 --> 19:00.471
Guards!

19:00.473 --> 19:02.306
Guards, help!

19:02.308 --> 19:03.608
Your guards are dead,

19:03.610 --> 19:05.243
And soon you will be, too,

19:05.245 --> 19:07.445
But the boy will survive.

19:07.447 --> 19:08.412
Give him to me.

19:08.414 --> 19:09.747
Please leave us!

19:09.749 --> 19:11.716
I cannot.

19:11.718 --> 19:13.451
I am the darkness,

19:13.453 --> 19:15.253
The devourer,

19:15.255 --> 19:17.321
The feeder of the gods,

19:17.323 --> 19:19.657
But I cannot feed
them forever.

19:19.659 --> 19:23.427
Pascal,

19:23.429 --> 19:25.263
Offer her blood to the gods.

19:25.265 --> 19:26.797
Appease their hunger

19:26.799 --> 19:28.799
Before it grows.

19:28.801 --> 19:29.567
(grunts)

19:29.569 --> 19:31.235
(gasps)

19:34.173 --> 19:36.741
(women sobbing)

19:41.847 --> 19:44.182
Excuse me.

19:44.184 --> 19:45.917
I have a list of the officers

19:45.919 --> 19:48.352
On the boat.
What's your bloke's name?

19:48.354 --> 19:50.354
Leith bayard, but I don't think
he was an officer.

19:50.356 --> 19:52.223
The foot soldiers
are laid out elsewhere.

19:52.225 --> 19:54.325
I can show you.
Leith:
Greer!

19:54.327 --> 19:57.395
(gasps)
you survived. You survived.

20:00.465 --> 20:03.768
Catherine:
<i>This is why the people</i>
<i>love a joust.</i>

20:03.770 --> 20:05.269
<i>Seeing nobles knocked</i>
<i>on their asses</i>

20:05.271 --> 20:06.771
<i>After a long war.</i>

20:06.773 --> 20:08.439
(horse neighs)

20:13.445 --> 20:15.313
(courtiers exclaim)

20:19.885 --> 20:22.453
Ah, lord montgomery takes down
another opponent.

20:24.223 --> 20:26.624
(catherine sighs)

20:28.327 --> 20:29.393
Henry:
Where is everybody?

20:29.395 --> 20:30.895
And why are they all so dour?

20:30.897 --> 20:32.964
They're at a joust,
not a funeral.

20:32.966 --> 20:36.234
Many of them lost loved ones
in your mock battle, henry.

20:36.236 --> 20:38.402
(trumpet blows fanfare)

20:38.404 --> 20:40.571
Announcer:
Hail queen mary.

20:46.845 --> 20:49.247
Henry:
Good god, finally.

20:49.249 --> 20:51.382
Woman:
It's the english crest.
Mary!

20:51.384 --> 20:53.417
My god, she's wearing
the english coat of arms.

20:53.419 --> 20:55.019
Woman:
The queen of scotland!

20:55.021 --> 20:56.821
(cheering)

20:56.823 --> 20:59.290
She's all but declaring
herself England's queen.

21:00.292 --> 21:03.961
Mary! Mary!
Mary! Mary!

21:03.963 --> 21:06.998
Mary!
Mary!

21:07.000 --> 21:08.799
Catherine:
Who knew all it took

21:08.801 --> 21:10.501
Was a statement dress

21:10.503 --> 21:12.436
To get France in
the palm of her hands.

21:12.438 --> 21:13.537
She is the future.

21:15.340 --> 21:16.340
They see that.

21:18.977 --> 21:20.444
(whooping)

21:22.514 --> 21:24.382
Man:
I can't see her!

21:26.418 --> 21:29.820
You're ready,
aren't you?

21:29.822 --> 21:31.689
It's like we dream
the same dreams.

21:40.632 --> 21:42.466
Mary, mary!
Long live
queen mary!

21:42.468 --> 21:44.302
(cheering)
queen mary!

21:44.304 --> 21:47.371
Man:
Is she really
taking England?

21:47.373 --> 21:49.507
(wild cheering)

21:51.810 --> 21:53.311
They've lost control
of themselves.

21:53.313 --> 21:55.012
Have they forgotten
who the king is?

21:55.014 --> 21:57.581
I'll give them something
to cheer for.

21:58.550 --> 22:00.351
Halt the competition!

22:00.353 --> 22:01.952
I am going to joust

22:01.954 --> 22:03.888
Lord montgomery.
Gamekeeper...

22:03.890 --> 22:06.424
But, your majesty,
his armor's damaged,

22:06.426 --> 22:07.425
He'll need a fresh horse.

22:07.427 --> 22:10.328
Then you have much to attend to.

22:10.330 --> 22:12.530
(courtiers cheering)

22:16.034 --> 22:17.768
Members of the english
contingent are leaving.

22:17.770 --> 22:19.370
Off to warn
elizabeth.

22:19.372 --> 22:20.971
I hope you know
what you're doing.

22:20.973 --> 22:22.473
Send your riders
after theirs.

22:22.475 --> 22:23.974
If they stop,
they may reveal

22:23.976 --> 22:25.409
Some english sympathizers

22:25.411 --> 22:26.644
Amongst the french.

22:26.646 --> 22:28.612
Catherine:
You're squeezing your cousin

22:28.614 --> 22:30.414
Elizabeth's throat,
and to what end?

22:30.416 --> 22:31.882
To give the people hope.

22:31.884 --> 22:34.652
So they can imagine
a brighter future.

22:34.654 --> 22:37.588
Such glory
you promise.

22:37.590 --> 22:40.658
And so cunning
you've become.

22:40.660 --> 22:42.059
How you've
changed

22:42.061 --> 22:44.028
Since you came back
to us from convent.

22:45.497 --> 22:46.797
I miss the girl you were.

22:46.799 --> 22:48.499
Many will.

22:49.468 --> 22:51.736
She was easier to kill.

22:51.738 --> 22:53.804
I love you.
I love you.

22:55.507 --> 22:56.841
I have to secure
the door.
It's locked.

23:00.746 --> 23:01.979
Let me help
you undress.

23:01.981 --> 23:04.448
Please, just...
Just hold me,

23:04.450 --> 23:05.883
A little more,
please.

23:05.885 --> 23:07.551
We have no reason to stop.

23:07.553 --> 23:08.652
I want to marry you.

23:13.759 --> 23:15.393
Greer, don't do this.

23:15.395 --> 23:17.395
I thought
you were dead.

23:17.397 --> 23:18.763
I'm not.

23:18.765 --> 23:20.731
I'm standing right
here before you,

23:20.733 --> 23:22.533
And you should not let me go.

23:22.535 --> 23:24.068
Not for money, or your family,
or anything.

23:24.070 --> 23:25.770
Nothing's changed,

23:25.772 --> 23:27.505
Except I felt
the pain of your loss

23:27.507 --> 23:30.474
More deeply than
I ever thought I could.

23:30.476 --> 23:33.077
And you will.

23:33.079 --> 23:34.779
I swear to you, greer,

23:34.781 --> 23:36.447
If you don't take this
chance with me, you will.

23:36.449 --> 23:38.482
Marry me.

23:38.484 --> 23:39.850
Marry me!

23:39.852 --> 23:42.486
No, leith,
I can't.

23:42.488 --> 23:43.821
I can't!

23:58.136 --> 24:00.438
When you are alone
and miserable,

24:00.440 --> 24:01.772
Remember this is the moment

24:01.774 --> 24:03.474
That you threw
your happiness away.

24:05.710 --> 24:06.977
And I'll remember you
as the woman

24:06.979 --> 24:08.612
Who told me I wasn't enough.

24:10.148 --> 24:11.482
I will become everything

24:11.484 --> 24:13.617
You are so convinced
that you need.

24:13.619 --> 24:17.555
I will rise and rise and rise,

24:17.557 --> 24:19.657
Until I am rich and powerful.

24:21.493 --> 24:24.195
But I will never be yours again.

24:28.033 --> 24:30.100
(door opens and closes)

24:35.640 --> 24:37.508
(horse snorts)
your lance, your highness.

24:37.510 --> 24:38.776
Announcer:
His majesty king henry

24:38.778 --> 24:41.579
And lord montgomery.

24:45.016 --> 24:48.018
(cheering)

24:52.591 --> 24:53.591
(courtiers whoop)

24:58.697 --> 24:59.930
Catherine:
I suppose that's

24:59.932 --> 25:01.866
Good comeuppance
for montgomery.

25:01.868 --> 25:03.200
He will have to
take the blows...

25:03.202 --> 25:06.837
It's bad business
to outshine your boss.

25:10.075 --> 25:11.675
(courtiers cheer, whistle)
woman:
King henry!

25:30.061 --> 25:30.961
(gasps)

25:30.963 --> 25:33.264
(courtiers exclaiming)

25:36.101 --> 25:38.202
Catherine:
For god's sake,
go to him!

25:38.204 --> 25:39.737
Is the king
all right?

25:39.739 --> 25:40.738
Your majesty! Your majesty!

25:40.740 --> 25:42.039
Your majesty!

25:42.041 --> 25:44.575
(murmuring)

25:44.577 --> 25:46.544
The king has been
gravely injured!

25:46.546 --> 25:48.112
Where is the
physician?!

25:49.114 --> 25:51.015
(whinnies)
your majesty...

26:14.139 --> 26:16.674
(screams)

26:16.676 --> 26:17.908
It's all right.

26:17.910 --> 26:19.743
I'm here.
Are you hurt?

26:19.745 --> 26:21.245
No, but...
Bash, look out!

26:23.248 --> 26:24.815
(grunting)

26:34.292 --> 26:36.293
(groaning)

26:41.933 --> 26:43.767
Get kenna and pascal
out of here.

26:44.936 --> 26:46.203
Pascal must
succeed me,

26:46.205 --> 26:47.371
Or the black death
will awaken.

26:47.373 --> 26:48.939
Nostradamus:
The black death.

26:48.941 --> 26:50.708
The plague.

26:50.710 --> 26:52.242
That's what the signs
at visegard were
counting down to.

26:52.244 --> 26:54.244
Bash, I've
had visions.

26:54.246 --> 26:55.312
The castle
beset by death.

26:55.314 --> 26:56.914
Bodies laid out
in the hall.

26:56.916 --> 26:59.950
It will happen, if
my work is not done.

26:59.952 --> 27:03.621
Stay with kenna
and pascal, please.

27:03.623 --> 27:05.289
How rare is
the gift of sight.

27:05.291 --> 27:06.790
I don't believe you have it.

27:06.792 --> 27:08.158
I think you're a killer,

27:08.160 --> 27:09.293
Feeding on others' fears.

27:15.767 --> 27:17.368
You're pagan-born.

27:17.370 --> 27:19.236
Deny it, but
in your heart

27:19.238 --> 27:20.938
You know the
gods have power.

27:20.940 --> 27:23.307
They demand respect.

27:23.309 --> 27:24.708
Blood.

27:24.710 --> 27:26.043
And if they don't get it...

27:26.045 --> 27:27.978
You took the blood,
not the gods.

27:27.980 --> 27:29.213
I'm here to
save you.

27:29.215 --> 27:32.116
I took my people
into the blood wood

27:32.118 --> 27:33.884
And showed them how
to feed the gods,

27:33.886 --> 27:36.053
And since that day
the plague has not returned.

27:36.055 --> 27:38.255
But the gods
hold it leashed,

27:38.257 --> 27:40.357
In the shadows,

27:40.359 --> 27:42.192
And if I die
without a successor,

27:42.194 --> 27:45.229
It will run wild over the land.

27:45.231 --> 27:46.697
Bring pascal to me,

27:46.699 --> 27:48.332
And I will save
your world.

27:48.334 --> 27:49.366
His father knew

27:49.368 --> 27:51.068
It was his fate.

27:51.070 --> 27:53.070
He understood the honor.
No.

27:53.072 --> 27:54.338
No more children,

27:54.340 --> 27:56.073
No more sacrifices,

27:56.075 --> 27:58.175
And the slaughter of
innocents ends here.

27:58.177 --> 27:59.243
It can't end!

27:59.245 --> 28:01.111
(both yell)

28:10.355 --> 28:11.789
Francis:
<i>Does he live yet?</i>

28:11.791 --> 28:13.323
He lingers.

28:13.325 --> 28:14.425
He won't survive;
they say he can't.

28:14.427 --> 28:16.260
There's pieces

28:16.262 --> 28:17.361
Of the lance stuck in his brain.

28:18.897 --> 28:20.431
Is this what
we wanted?

28:20.433 --> 28:22.066
Mary:
It isn't.

28:22.068 --> 28:24.301
Henry's fall was out of
our hands completely.

28:25.770 --> 28:27.171
Is that not god's will?

28:27.173 --> 28:29.106
Now no more blood
needs to be spilled.

28:29.108 --> 28:30.340
None but my father's.

28:31.843 --> 28:33.243
We should say good-bye.

28:41.920 --> 28:43.320
Catherine:
In spite of our feelings,

28:43.322 --> 28:45.155
I've always tried
to do what's been best

28:45.157 --> 28:46.390
For our children
and for you.

28:46.392 --> 28:48.492
And for France.

28:48.494 --> 28:50.928
Shh, there are
no more regrets.

28:50.930 --> 28:53.030
In my way,

28:53.032 --> 28:55.365
I have always loved you.

28:56.968 --> 28:58.869
(whispering):
You are the love of my life.

29:00.171 --> 29:03.373
Oh, to see your kindness
returned...

29:03.375 --> 29:05.342
Yours must, as well.

29:05.344 --> 29:07.377
It's in you still.

29:07.379 --> 29:10.380
You must show
it to diane.

29:10.382 --> 29:13.250
She is unprotected
once I'm gone.

29:13.252 --> 29:17.087
After being so much a part
of my life, of ours...

29:17.089 --> 29:18.455
Neither of you should be alone.

29:20.425 --> 29:23.427
She is extended family,
your equal in s...

29:23.429 --> 29:25.462
So many ways.

29:25.464 --> 29:26.797
Catherine...

29:29.234 --> 29:30.868
...Be friends.

29:30.870 --> 29:34.204
Please reach out to her.

29:34.206 --> 29:36.273
Yes.

29:37.475 --> 29:39.376
I will reach out to her.

29:41.479 --> 29:43.547
Rest now, henry.

29:45.383 --> 29:47.417
Rest long.

29:47.419 --> 29:49.419
Francis, now.

29:49.421 --> 29:50.954
Just francis.

30:05.937 --> 30:08.005
(door opens)

30:11.843 --> 30:13.944
(door closes)

30:13.946 --> 30:16.146
Francis, what have you come
to say to me?

30:17.515 --> 30:19.483
Must we right every wrong?

30:19.485 --> 30:23.020
I'm not sure
what you mean, father.

30:25.256 --> 30:27.057
Oh, it's you.

30:29.327 --> 30:32.930
Did I tell you that you were
named after my elder brother?

30:32.932 --> 30:34.464
He was to be king.

30:34.466 --> 30:35.933
He feared the job,

30:35.935 --> 30:38.468
The giving and taking of lives
to a cause.

30:41.573 --> 30:44.107
He was like you
in that way, too.

30:45.443 --> 30:49.279
I thought him weak.

30:49.281 --> 30:51.548
I knew I would be a better king.

30:54.219 --> 30:57.554
It was a competition all along.

30:59.858 --> 31:01.291
Such

31:01.293 --> 31:03.627
Games we play
against those we love.

31:05.864 --> 31:07.264
I won it all.

31:07.266 --> 31:09.032
On a tennis court
of all places.

31:09.034 --> 31:11.468
When he collapsed

31:11.470 --> 31:14.004
After I poisoned his water.

31:18.443 --> 31:21.411
You killed your brother.

31:21.413 --> 31:23.413
No one ever knew.

31:23.415 --> 31:26.416
Now I know why you warned me

31:26.418 --> 31:28.952
Against my brother.

31:28.954 --> 31:31.021
Turned me against sebastian.

31:32.624 --> 31:35.592
Betraying someone you love

31:35.594 --> 31:37.427
Blackens your soul.

31:37.429 --> 31:39.596
It's a weight you carry

31:39.598 --> 31:42.532
All of your days.

31:48.539 --> 31:51.308
Can I let it go now?

32:18.069 --> 32:20.137
God forgive me.

32:26.077 --> 32:27.711
Man:
The king is dead.

32:27.713 --> 32:29.980
Long live the king!

32:31.582 --> 32:33.550
Man 2:
The king is dead.
Long live the king!

32:33.552 --> 32:35.585
Man 3:
The king is dead.
Long live the king!

32:35.587 --> 32:37.554
Man 4:
The king is dead.
Long live the king!

32:37.556 --> 32:39.623
Man 5: The king is dead.
Long live the king!

(indistinct chatter)

33:06.351 --> 33:08.485
(short laugh)
well, hello there.

33:08.487 --> 33:10.387
Leith. Do you recall?

33:10.389 --> 33:13.090
Yvette. Rhymes with
"how could I forget?"

33:14.492 --> 33:15.592
A new government is forming

33:15.594 --> 33:18.695
Between toasts and whispers.

33:18.697 --> 33:20.697
So let's have
that drink now.

33:20.699 --> 33:22.733
What changed?

33:22.735 --> 33:25.202
You were in such a hurry
when last we met.

33:25.204 --> 33:26.670
I wasn't thirsty then.

33:26.672 --> 33:28.638
I am now.

33:28.640 --> 33:30.640
Another time.

33:30.642 --> 33:33.043
As this hour,
I am destined to meet another.

33:33.045 --> 33:35.579
Aren't you a heartbreaker?
Not at all.

33:35.581 --> 33:38.482
Don't you be one, either.

33:45.723 --> 33:47.657
You're late.

33:47.659 --> 33:49.760
Only barely.

33:49.762 --> 33:51.661
I couldn't leave right away
as I'd spent hours

33:51.663 --> 33:53.263
Waiting for you,
bored senseless,

33:53.265 --> 33:55.665
And then suddenly, I...

33:55.667 --> 33:57.234
Oh, father.

33:57.236 --> 33:58.735
My evening took

33:58.737 --> 34:00.670
The loveliest turn.
(laughs)

34:00.672 --> 34:02.739
(lola screaming)

34:02.741 --> 34:05.742
Word's back
from the village.

34:05.744 --> 34:09.479
The midwife's taken ill herself
and is no condition to travel.

34:09.481 --> 34:11.148
The baby should
have come by now.

34:11.150 --> 34:12.482
Yes. It should have.

34:12.484 --> 34:14.818
I fear for its life,
and yours as well.

34:14.820 --> 34:16.486
I don't mean to scare you.

34:16.488 --> 34:17.788
Are there words
you want written down

34:17.790 --> 34:19.656
In case?

34:19.658 --> 34:20.690
Yes.

34:20.692 --> 34:22.125
But if there's any way

34:22.127 --> 34:23.527
You can save the baby...

34:23.529 --> 34:24.661
None that wouldn't kill you.

34:24.663 --> 34:25.829
Or that I'm equipped for.

34:29.600 --> 34:32.669
"my dear friend, mary.

34:32.671 --> 34:35.439
"I am alone
and my child struggles

34:35.441 --> 34:37.174
"to join this world.

34:37.176 --> 34:39.643
"I release you
from your promise,

34:39.645 --> 34:42.846
"from the protection
our secret gave me.

34:42.848 --> 34:45.782
"for julien has died.

34:45.784 --> 34:49.286
"and I'm afraid I
may soon join him.

34:49.288 --> 34:51.655
"please, bring help.

34:51.657 --> 34:55.325
"but if I die
and the child survives,

34:55.327 --> 34:58.195
"care for my baby
as if it were your own.

34:58.197 --> 34:59.863
With francis."

35:01.666 --> 35:05.268
Your friend is
mary, queen of scots?

35:05.270 --> 35:06.670
Yes.

35:06.672 --> 35:08.772
Please, have it
taken to the castle.

35:08.774 --> 35:11.541
(groaning)
and hurry!

35:13.611 --> 35:14.878
Bash.

35:14.880 --> 35:18.815
I'm so sorry
about your father.

35:21.252 --> 35:23.153
I don't know what my
place is here anymore.

35:23.155 --> 35:25.322
Your place is with me.

35:25.324 --> 35:27.390
No, I meant...
I know what you meant.

35:27.392 --> 35:28.792
You don't need
your father's name

35:28.794 --> 35:30.460
Or to slay every dragon
to be worth something.

35:30.462 --> 35:31.561
You've done enough.

35:31.563 --> 35:33.330
You are enough.

35:33.332 --> 35:35.799
Now you deserve some
happiness of your own.

35:35.801 --> 35:38.768
I think I found it in you.

35:38.770 --> 35:39.736
I love you.

35:39.738 --> 35:42.339
I love you, too.

35:42.341 --> 35:44.207
What a miracle.

35:46.444 --> 35:48.245
(short laugh)

35:48.247 --> 35:49.279
(gasps)

35:49.281 --> 35:50.313
Look!

35:50.315 --> 35:52.816
Shooting star.

35:52.818 --> 35:55.886
Ooh, another one.

35:58.589 --> 36:00.824
The stars are falling.

36:00.826 --> 36:03.860
It's the final sign before the
darkness said it would return.

36:03.862 --> 36:05.428
He said it would sweep the land.

36:05.430 --> 36:06.830
What would?

36:06.832 --> 36:09.766
The plague.

36:09.768 --> 36:11.234
(door opens)

36:11.236 --> 36:12.669
Mary:
<i>Francis, you haven't slept!</i>

36:12.671 --> 36:14.371
The nobles and my
father's advisors

36:14.373 --> 36:17.908
Were in my ear all night.

36:17.910 --> 36:20.844
I am the king of France.

36:20.846 --> 36:22.779
Yes, you are.

36:22.781 --> 36:25.782
I never wanted it
to happen this way.

36:25.784 --> 36:28.218
Fearing my own father,

36:28.220 --> 36:30.620
Hating him at the end.

36:30.622 --> 36:32.289
I saw the bodies of those men

36:32.291 --> 36:34.291
That drowned in those boats.

36:34.293 --> 36:35.892
Heroes slaughtered.

36:35.894 --> 36:38.228
I saw the way
that he touched your face.

36:38.230 --> 36:39.963
You were at the tournament?

36:43.201 --> 36:44.935
Mary, I know that you said
that my father's death

36:44.937 --> 36:47.537
Was god's will...
Francis, it was.

36:47.539 --> 36:50.941
Although some people
would question a god

36:50.943 --> 36:53.243
Who grants us such power,
based on nothing

36:53.245 --> 36:54.911
But the fortune of our birth.

36:54.913 --> 36:56.846
It isn't fair,

36:56.848 --> 36:59.482
The privileges we are given.

36:59.484 --> 37:01.851
And the price
we must pay for them.

37:04.222 --> 37:06.823
I can feel myself changing.

37:06.825 --> 37:08.792
And not for the better.

37:08.794 --> 37:10.727
Every choice I have made

37:10.729 --> 37:13.863
To protect France and
scotland, even you,

37:13.865 --> 37:16.633
For all of them
there is a reckoning.

37:16.635 --> 37:19.402
And it's always the woman
who must bow to the queen.

37:19.404 --> 37:22.672
I feel like I'm killing
part of myself.

37:22.674 --> 37:26.576
But I'm ignoring my heart
until it becomes blind and deaf.

37:26.578 --> 37:30.513
I can feel myself growing
harder and I worry that I...

37:30.515 --> 37:33.883
That I'm becoming someone
you will not love.

37:33.885 --> 37:36.253
Then don't.

37:36.255 --> 37:38.822
Don't grow harder,
share your burdens,

37:38.824 --> 37:41.992
Tell me your darkest
truths, and I...

37:41.994 --> 37:43.893
I will tell you mine.

37:43.895 --> 37:46.930
So we don't end up
married but alone,

37:46.932 --> 37:49.599
Two people going
down separate paths,

37:49.601 --> 37:52.836
Justifying our sins
as acts of survival.

37:52.838 --> 37:55.705
If we can forgive each
other, perhaps we can

37:55.707 --> 37:57.540
Forgive ourselves.

37:57.542 --> 37:58.975
(door opens)

37:58.977 --> 38:00.577
Excuse me, your grace,

38:00.579 --> 38:02.846
But there's an urgent letter
from lady lola.

38:04.949 --> 38:07.584
Thank you.

38:13.924 --> 38:16.059
Lola's giving birth.

38:17.695 --> 38:19.362
Julien is dead,
and she is all alone.

38:19.364 --> 38:20.530
Where is she?

38:20.532 --> 38:23.066
Uh, at-at a house by the mill.

38:30.041 --> 38:32.809
You should go.

38:32.811 --> 38:33.910
Me?

38:33.912 --> 38:36.880
You.

38:38.549 --> 38:40.984
Because you are
the father of her child.

38:40.986 --> 38:43.787
Because I've wanted
to tell you for months.

38:43.789 --> 38:46.690
Because, finally,
lola wants you to know it, too.

38:48.025 --> 38:50.493
Francis, she writes
that she may not survive.

38:50.495 --> 38:52.462
There is no time to lose.

38:52.464 --> 38:54.731
Be there when, god willing,

38:54.733 --> 38:56.700
Your child comes into the world.

38:56.702 --> 38:58.535
Hurry, and I will come
and join you

38:58.537 --> 39:00.103
After I have gathered some help.

39:00.105 --> 39:02.906
All this time...
I will explain after.

39:02.908 --> 39:05.842
But for now I beg you,
be by her side.

39:08.579 --> 39:10.447
Go.

39:16.087 --> 39:18.955
I need a doctor.

39:18.957 --> 39:21.558
Or a midwife. Lola needs help.

39:21.560 --> 39:23.593
No one will be leaving
or entering the castle.

39:23.595 --> 39:25.829
Not for some time.
I'll speak with the guards.

39:25.831 --> 39:28.098
The portcullis will be lowered,
all gates will be secured.

39:28.100 --> 39:29.766
Why? What's happening?

39:29.768 --> 39:31.000
Word has come from
surrounding villages.

39:31.002 --> 39:31.968
People are dying of plague.

39:31.970 --> 39:33.503
Standing in the same room

39:33.505 --> 39:35.672
With someone who is ill
risks infection.

39:35.674 --> 39:37.507
I know what the plague does.
People are already

39:37.509 --> 39:39.109
Hiding their sick
for fear of being locked

39:39.111 --> 39:39.976
In their homes with them.

39:39.978 --> 39:40.977
But, lola, she...

39:40.979 --> 39:42.445
You cannot help her.

39:42.447 --> 39:44.981
Francis is leaving the castle

39:44.983 --> 39:46.015
To go and be with her!

39:46.017 --> 39:47.384
Stop him!

39:51.489 --> 39:54.057
Mary:
Francis, wait!

39:54.059 --> 39:55.125
Thank god you haven't left.

39:55.127 --> 39:56.159
What is it?

39:56.161 --> 39:57.794
People are dying.

39:57.796 --> 39:59.162
The plague has come
and it's spreading.

39:59.164 --> 40:00.830
Your mother has ordered
the castle locked down.

40:00.832 --> 40:01.998
Lola is not far from here.

40:02.000 --> 40:03.166
I shall return with
her and the baby.

40:03.168 --> 40:04.534
No, francis, you can't leave.

40:04.536 --> 40:05.769
You urged me to be by her side.

40:05.771 --> 40:07.470
You know she shouldn't
be alone now.

40:07.472 --> 40:08.905
It's a terrible decision,

40:08.907 --> 40:11.474
But it's our duty
as rulers to make the right one.

40:11.476 --> 40:14.010
You are going to a village
which has likely been exposed

40:14.012 --> 40:15.745
To plague.
If you bring back people

40:15.747 --> 40:17.614
Who may have been infected
with it...
"people"?

40:17.616 --> 40:20.650
Your friend.
My child, perhaps my only child.

40:22.086 --> 40:23.853
You're not just risking
your life,

40:23.855 --> 40:25.722
But everyone in this castle.

40:25.724 --> 40:27.791
If you leave, and you return
with anybody who is ill...

40:27.793 --> 40:29.025
Mary, you said

40:29.027 --> 40:30.093
You felt yourself
growing harder.

40:30.095 --> 40:31.094
Don't let it happen.

40:31.096 --> 40:32.762
Listen to your heart,

40:32.764 --> 40:35.498
And you will hear it
as clearly as I do.

40:35.500 --> 40:38.568
You are the king of France!

40:38.570 --> 40:39.969
You no longer have the privilege
of obeying your heart!

40:39.971 --> 40:41.938
That's not the kind of king
that I want to be.

40:47.678 --> 40:49.446
Lower the gates.

40:49.448 --> 40:51.681
But king francis...
Is aware of the threat
to us all.

40:51.683 --> 40:53.817
Lower the gates now.
