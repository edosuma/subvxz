00:04.541 --> 00:06.941
What happens to a dream deferred?

00:08.111 --> 00:10.341
Does it dry up Iike a raisin in the sun?

00:11.648 --> 00:13.377
Pull it in up here.

00:13.450 --> 00:16.681
Or fester Iike a sore, and then run?

00:19.790 --> 00:22.418
Does it stink Iike rotten meat?

00:23.026 --> 00:26.860
Or crust and sugar over, Iike a syrupy sweet.

00:28.098 --> 00:31.465
Maybe it just sags Iike a heavy Ioad.

00:32.269 --> 00:35.261
Or does it expIode?

00:37.073 --> 00:40.440
Come on, Johnson, l'm out.
And there's still hot water.

00:41.111 --> 00:44.012
-Morning, Lena.
-Morning, Earline.

01:29.860 --> 01:31.794
-Hi.
-Morning.

01:33.730 --> 01:35.391
-Watch your step.
-Morning.

02:23.680 --> 02:25.739
Walter, it's after seven.

02:32.756 --> 02:34.724
You're gonna be late.

02:35.525 --> 02:37.117
Travis out of the bathroom yet?

02:37.193 --> 02:39.661
No, not yet, but he will be soon.

02:39.729 --> 02:41.697
And, what's the point
in having an alarm clock

02:41.765 --> 02:44.325
if you don't get up when it goes off?

02:44.401 --> 02:47.165
What l need an alarm clock for
when l got you?

02:47.237 --> 02:50.968
Only problem is,
l can't just hit a button and turn you off.

02:52.542 --> 02:53.975
Woman.

02:55.011 --> 02:57.275
What kind of eggs you want?

02:58.048 --> 02:59.481
Not scrambled.

03:08.224 --> 03:10.749
-Where the paper?
-Where it always is.

03:11.127 --> 03:12.526
What's your problem this morning?

03:12.595 --> 03:16.190
l don't have a problem. And l hope
you don't volunteer to become one.

03:16.266 --> 03:18.234
Yeah, you got a problem.

03:30.847 --> 03:33.714
What's that boy doing in the bathroom
all this time?

03:36.786 --> 03:38.515
He's just gonna have
to start getting up earlier.

03:38.588 --> 03:41.352
l can't be being late to work on
account of him fooling around in there.

03:41.424 --> 03:43.619
No, he is not gonna be getting up no earlier.

03:43.793 --> 03:46.591
lt's not his fault he can't get to bed at night
because he got a bunch of

03:46.663 --> 03:49.530
crazy, loudmouth, good-for-nothing people,
running their mouths

03:49.599 --> 03:52.295
in what's supposed to be his bedroom
after 10:00 at night.

03:52.369 --> 03:53.597
Why they gotta be loudmouths?

03:53.670 --> 03:58.403
Because they are loud, and nothing that
comes out of them mouths is important.

03:58.708 --> 04:01.040
Not enough to keep my little boy awake.

04:01.111 --> 04:02.942
That's what you're mad about, ain't it?

04:03.013 --> 04:04.378
Things l want to talk about with my friends

04:04.447 --> 04:07.746
just couldn't be important
in your mind, could they?

04:10.487 --> 04:12.785
Come here.

04:12.856 --> 04:15.324
You looking young this morning, baby.

04:15.759 --> 04:18.523
Looking just like how you looked
when l started courting you.

04:24.534 --> 04:27.970
lt's gone now. You look like yourself again.

04:28.038 --> 04:29.767
Just eat your eggs.

04:32.375 --> 04:34.343
You know that insurance check come
tomorrow, don't you?

04:34.411 --> 04:37.903
Yeah, l know.
l really don't want to talk about it.

04:38.782 --> 04:42.513
l'm out, but you better hurry. l heard
Mr. Johnson coming down the steps.

04:51.361 --> 04:53.022
The check comes tomorrow, right, Mama?

04:53.096 --> 04:56.532
Yes, it does, Travis. But it's too early
in the morning to be talking about money

04:56.599 --> 04:57.964
so just eat your breakfast.

04:58.034 --> 04:59.695
But l need fifty cents.

04:59.769 --> 05:02.237
-For what?
-For the poor Negroes in history.

05:02.305 --> 05:03.363
For the what?

05:03.440 --> 05:06.773
Teacher says we gotta do something about
teaching colored kids about they history.

05:06.843 --> 05:11.507
''Their'' history. And what's that got to
do with fifty cents and poor Negroes?

05:11.581 --> 05:14.106
All us kids are putting in fifty cents
to buy special books

05:14.184 --> 05:16.709
that'll tell us about the things
the poor Negroes did.

05:16.786 --> 05:18.947
ls that the way the teacher put it,
the ''poor Negroes''?

05:19.022 --> 05:21.081
Yes, ma'am. That's the way
she always puts it.

05:21.157 --> 05:23.955
And they need fifty cents for
special books for the poor Negroes.

05:24.027 --> 05:26.393
-Yes, Mama, that's what l said.
-l don't have it.

05:26.463 --> 05:28.658
But l don't want to be the only one
without the money, Ma.

05:28.731 --> 05:30.892
l said l don't have it, Travis.

05:31.367 --> 05:33.335
Just eat your breakfast.

05:34.871 --> 05:36.338
l'm finished.

05:39.843 --> 05:42.175
Then go on and make up your bed.

05:54.491 --> 05:56.254
Can l maybe bag groceries
at the market after...

05:56.326 --> 05:57.452
Travis.

06:02.499 --> 06:05.332
And no sweet rolls today,
Mr. Angry Little Man.

06:05.401 --> 06:08.461
You wanna have all your teeth
in your head when you get older.

06:08.538 --> 06:09.800
l'm gone.

06:21.184 --> 06:24.745
''l know that woman wants me
to kiss her goodbye, but l'll fix her.

06:24.854 --> 06:27.584
''l won't kiss her, and she'll be sorry.

06:29.092 --> 06:31.026
''l won't kiss her goodbye
for nothing in this world,

06:31.094 --> 06:34.393
'''cause l know that's
just what she wants me to do.''

06:35.398 --> 06:36.865
Mama.

06:37.834 --> 06:41.565
Can l please bag groceries? Can l, Mama?

06:41.671 --> 06:44.139
-What is it he want to do?
-Bag groceries after school.

06:44.207 --> 06:48.109
-For the poor Negroes in history, Dad.
-Travis. No.

06:49.312 --> 06:51.974
-School's raising money for something.
-l gotta have fifty cents.

06:52.048 --> 06:55.279
-Why don't you give it to him?
-'Cause we don't have it.

06:55.351 --> 06:58.650
What you going telling the boy
things like that for?

06:59.489 --> 07:01.184
Come here, Travis.

07:04.694 --> 07:06.286
Thanks, Daddy.

07:09.566 --> 07:12.126
ln fact, here's another fifty cents.

07:12.535 --> 07:15.834
Why don't you go buy yourself some fruit
or take a taxicab to school or something.

07:15.905 --> 07:18.465
Hot dog! Thanks, Daddy.

07:20.176 --> 07:23.077
-Go on to school now. Don't be late.
-All right.

07:25.215 --> 07:26.705
That's my boy.

07:32.855 --> 07:34.152
What?

07:42.131 --> 07:44.156
Know what l was thinking about
in the bathroom this morning?

07:44.234 --> 07:46.031
-No.
-Charlie Atkins.

07:46.769 --> 07:49.397
-You remember Charlie Atkins?
-No.

07:49.572 --> 07:50.937
You remember.

07:51.074 --> 07:54.168
Remember, he wanted me to go
in that dry cleaning business with him.

07:54.244 --> 07:56.542
Now he's grossing $100,000 a year.

07:56.613 --> 07:57.910
$100,000.

07:57.981 --> 07:59.972
-That's nice, Walter.
-That could have been me.

08:00.049 --> 08:01.676
That could have been us.

08:01.751 --> 08:03.378
But he stepped up and l held back.

08:03.453 --> 08:04.977
Walter, you didn't have any money.

08:05.054 --> 08:08.148
That was true, then. This is now.
This is our time, baby.

08:08.224 --> 08:10.886
Walter, if you're gonna
talk to me about that check...

08:10.960 --> 08:12.894
Me, Willy and Bobo,
we got this thing figured out.

08:12.962 --> 08:14.224
Bobo?

08:14.297 --> 08:17.232
Walter, l got nothing to do with that check.

08:24.007 --> 08:27.135
You're tired, ain't you, baby?
Tired of everything.

08:27.877 --> 08:30.710
Me, the boy, the way we live.

08:33.015 --> 08:35.712
So tired you couldn't do nothing
to help us out, could you?

08:35.784 --> 08:37.217
Walter.

08:37.287 --> 08:38.982
Mama will listen to you.

08:39.054 --> 08:42.456
You know she listens to you more
than she listens to anybody else.

08:42.592 --> 08:44.753
That's all l need you to do.

08:44.827 --> 08:47.295
Tomorrow morning when you're
sitting down drinking your coffee,

08:47.363 --> 08:49.695
just sip on your coffee, real easy like,

08:49.766 --> 08:53.497
and talk to her like what you're saying
ain't really that important to you.

08:53.569 --> 08:56.402
Then sip on your coffee some more

08:57.473 --> 09:01.068
and tell her that you've been thinking about
the deal Walter Lee is so interested in.

09:01.144 --> 09:03.806
And before you know it, she'll be
listening good, asking you questions,

09:03.880 --> 09:05.780
and when l come home
l can fill her in on all the details.

09:05.848 --> 09:06.906
No, Walter, no.

09:06.983 --> 09:09.247
This ain't no fly-by-night proposition, baby.

09:09.319 --> 09:10.843
-This is real.
-They're all real.

09:10.920 --> 09:13.081
All the schemes that go nowhere.

09:13.156 --> 09:15.750
-Not like this one.
-No, Walter.

09:15.825 --> 09:17.224
Why not?

09:18.027 --> 09:22.225
First of all, l'm not gonna be
pretending anything with your mother.

09:22.298 --> 09:25.267
Now that's your nonsense. That's not mine.

09:25.335 --> 09:29.396
And second of all,
the money doesn't belong to us, Walter.

09:29.505 --> 09:33.032
-lt's your mother's money.
-What's she gonna do with it?

09:33.309 --> 09:36.745
Walter, just finish your breakfast.
Come on, go to work.

09:36.813 --> 09:39.247
-Why can't you listen to me?
-Walter, don't shout at me.

09:39.315 --> 09:40.714
That's the only way
l can get through to you.

09:40.783 --> 09:42.273
Walter, please.

09:51.661 --> 09:53.959
Ruth. Ruth, listen.

09:55.565 --> 09:58.363
Now it normally costs $75,000,
to get into something

09:58.434 --> 09:59.867
like we're thinking about getting into,

09:59.936 --> 10:02.496
but Willy knows somebody
that can get us in for 30.

10:02.572 --> 10:04.403
That's 10,000 three ways.

10:04.474 --> 10:05.873
Plus a little something extra
to spread around

10:05.942 --> 10:07.807
to the people to get the licenses approved.

10:07.877 --> 10:10.641
-You mean bribes?
-Don't call it that.

10:10.713 --> 10:14.342
This is business. Don't nothing happen in
this world unless somebody's getting paid.

10:14.417 --> 10:16.317
Walter, eat your eggs.

10:16.386 --> 10:19.753
That's it? ''Eat your eggs''?

10:20.923 --> 10:23.517
Walter, that ain't none of our money.

10:34.971 --> 10:36.836
This morning l get up.

10:37.640 --> 10:41.337
l go to a bathroom l gotta share
with two floors of people.

10:44.013 --> 10:45.810
l look in the mirror.

10:46.416 --> 10:50.853
Thirty-five years old,
been married eleven years.

10:51.954 --> 10:54.787
l got a boy who sleeps in the living room.

10:56.392 --> 11:00.556
And all l got to tell him are stories
about how rich, white people live.

11:03.065 --> 11:05.033
Walter, eat your eggs.

11:05.101 --> 11:06.932
Damn these eggs.
Damn all the eggs that ever was!

11:07.003 --> 11:08.771
Fine. Just go to work!

11:09.172 --> 11:10.833
See, that says it all, don't it?

11:10.907 --> 11:12.340
Morning, everybody.

11:12.408 --> 11:14.137
Says just what's wrong with women today.

11:14.210 --> 11:17.441
Don't know how to build your man up,
make them feel like they can be somebody,

11:17.513 --> 11:20.073
-like they can do something.
-You know, not all women are like that.

11:20.149 --> 11:22.174
Just like there are some men
who actually do something.

11:22.251 --> 11:24.242
No thanks to their women.

11:25.455 --> 11:27.389
l'm gonna start timing people.

11:27.457 --> 11:29.482
You should get up earlier.

11:37.333 --> 11:41.497
Anybody ever tell you, you
a horrible-looking chick in the morning?

11:42.438 --> 11:44.463
Mama left early this morning?

11:44.540 --> 11:47.202
Yeah, her last day.

11:48.811 --> 11:51.109
So how's school coming?

11:51.180 --> 11:54.513
Lovely, just lovely.

11:54.851 --> 11:56.842
As if you really care.

11:57.153 --> 12:00.782
l was just wondering if you made up
your mind and everything.

12:00.857 --> 12:04.020
Not too many girls who decide
to become a doctor.

12:05.761 --> 12:08.389
Have we figured out exactly how much
medical school is gonna cost?

12:08.464 --> 12:11.399
Walter, why don't you leave your sister
alone and get on to work?

12:11.467 --> 12:13.162
You know that check coming tomorrow.

12:13.236 --> 12:15.170
The money belongs to Mama, Walter.

12:15.271 --> 12:18.536
She can do with it whatever she wants
or do nothing at all.

12:18.608 --> 12:21.372
Maybe just nail the check up
on the wall and stare at it all day.

12:21.444 --> 12:24.811
lt's hers and not ours. Hers.

12:24.881 --> 12:27.577
Well, now ain't we just
the considerate daughter?

12:27.650 --> 12:30.278
You just got your mother's best
interest at heart, don't you, girl?

12:30.353 --> 12:33.322
But it's okay if Mama want to
take a few thousand dollars of her money

12:33.389 --> 12:35.448
-to put you through college.
-l never asked her to do that.

12:35.525 --> 12:38.153
No, but the line between asking
and just accepting when the time comes

12:38.227 --> 12:40.593
-is big and wide, ain't it?
-What do you want from me, brother?

12:40.663 --> 12:43.257
To quit school or just drop dead? Which?

12:43.332 --> 12:45.630
-Either one would suit me fine.
-Walter!

12:45.701 --> 12:49.603
No, l'm sick of Her Holiness sashaying
around here like she all high and mighty.

12:49.672 --> 12:51.572
Me and Ruth,
we done made some sacrifices for you.

12:51.641 --> 12:54.201
Now it's time you start making some
sacrifices for the rest of the family.

12:54.277 --> 12:56.507
-Don't you be dragging me into this.
-Oh, no, you are in it.

12:56.579 --> 12:58.171
Aren't you the one that's
taking in other people's

12:58.247 --> 12:59.908
dirty laundry to put clothes on her back?

12:59.982 --> 13:01.176
Walter, that ain't fair.

13:01.250 --> 13:03.616
Oh, but it's fair
for Walter not to get anything.

13:03.686 --> 13:06.086
No, it's not like anybody expects you to get
on your knees and say,

13:06.155 --> 13:08.146
''Thank you, Walter. Thank you, Mama.

13:08.224 --> 13:10.920
''Thank you, Travis, for wearing
the same pair of shoes the last two years.''

13:10.993 --> 13:13.553
Well, l do, all right?

13:14.196 --> 13:19.532
Thank you, everybody! Thank you, God!
Thank you, Walter!

13:19.602 --> 13:20.796
Beneatha, stop it.

13:20.870 --> 13:22.565
Forgive me for ever wanting
to be anything at all.

13:22.638 --> 13:25.539
Forgive me. Forgive me. Forgive me!

13:25.608 --> 13:27.769
Who in the hell ever told you
to go be a doctor, anyway?

13:27.843 --> 13:28.867
You so crazy about messing
with sick people,

13:28.945 --> 13:30.412
why don't you go be a nurse
like other women?

13:30.479 --> 13:31.673
l'll be what l want to be.

13:31.747 --> 13:34.375
-With somebody else's money.
-lt's Mama's money.

13:34.450 --> 13:38.045
-He was my father, too.
-And mine and Travis's grandfather, too.

13:38.120 --> 13:40.145
Brow-beating me isn't gonna make her
give it to you

13:40.222 --> 13:42.247
to invest in some harebrained scheme.

13:42.325 --> 13:46.056
And l, for one,
say ''God Bless Mama'' for that.

13:46.529 --> 13:48.360
Are you listening to her?
Are you listening to her?

13:48.431 --> 13:52.265
Will you please just get out of here?
Get on to work, come on.

13:53.869 --> 13:56.099
Nobody in this house is ever gonna
understand me.

13:56.172 --> 13:57.332
'Cause you're a nut.

13:57.406 --> 13:58.566
-Who's a nut?
-You.

13:58.641 --> 14:00.632
Thee is mad, boy.

14:03.646 --> 14:07.639
The world's most backward
race of women, and that's a fact.

14:07.717 --> 14:10.379
And then there's you, a prophet
who would lead us out of the wilderness

14:10.453 --> 14:12.717
-and into the swamps.
-Bennie, why?

14:12.788 --> 14:15.313
Why do you have to rile your brother up
so much in the morning?

14:15.391 --> 14:17.916
'Cause it's too much fun not to.

14:25.434 --> 14:26.901
l need some money.

14:28.904 --> 14:30.201
Carfare.

14:31.340 --> 14:33.035
What, fifty cents?

14:51.794 --> 14:55.594
lf she didn't want to docent
the museum opening, she didn't have to.

14:55.665 --> 14:58.293
Well, yes l am. l am going to get involved.

14:58.367 --> 15:00.267
Because this kind of behavior
can't be tolerated.

15:00.336 --> 15:01.928
-Are you leaving?
-Yes.

15:03.005 --> 15:05.701
l've have late meetings,
so don't hold supper.

15:05.775 --> 15:08.175
Bring the car around for Mr. Arnold.

15:10.713 --> 15:12.408
l need to be at the Shipley building at noon.

15:12.481 --> 15:13.641
Yes, sir.

15:31.801 --> 15:33.234
Priscilla.

15:33.903 --> 15:37.964
l ain't playing no hide and seek, child.
You got to get to school.

15:38.574 --> 15:41.270
Well, it looks like you're not in here.

15:41.544 --> 15:43.034
And l know you're not in that closet.

15:43.112 --> 15:46.673
Not with that big, hairy spider
l saw in there yesterday.

15:48.084 --> 15:51.850
Come on, girl. Put this on.
School bus will be here directly.

15:52.121 --> 15:53.884
Are you still leaving?

15:53.956 --> 15:55.947
Yes, l'm still leaving.

15:56.192 --> 16:01.858
And just like yesterday, l expect you to be
a big girl and mind your mother.

16:02.465 --> 16:03.955
You hear me?

16:04.033 --> 16:06.126
Yes, Miss Lena.

16:06.335 --> 16:09.827
No sass. No pouting.
And no stomping them little feet.

16:12.608 --> 16:14.098
Turn around.

16:54.517 --> 16:55.745
Bobo, my man.

16:57.353 --> 16:59.218
So how we looking?

17:00.022 --> 17:03.321
l'm still working on it,
but the check don't come till tomorrow.

17:03.392 --> 17:05.484
So we have time. Seen Willy Harris?

17:05.560 --> 17:07.188
l saw him last night.

17:07.262 --> 17:11.461
He asked about you, l told him you're good.
Your word is better than gold.

17:11.534 --> 17:15.231
He wants to get together tonight,
nine o'clock at the Green Hat.

17:15.304 --> 17:17.636
Sounds good to me.

17:17.705 --> 17:20.539
-l can smell the money, baby.
-Yes, yes, yes.

17:21.242 --> 17:23.369
Let me guess.

17:23.444 --> 17:25.345
This car, he's driving, and this one's yours.

17:25.414 --> 17:27.211
l'm moving it, sir. Right away.

17:27.282 --> 17:30.514
Yes, boy, you will. After l cite you.

17:32.788 --> 17:34.585
You, get in your car.

17:48.337 --> 17:54.003
Verdi's La Traviata, Randolph Hall,
Friday night. You're with me.

17:54.910 --> 17:57.401
That your idea of asking for a date, George?

17:57.479 --> 17:59.970
lt's more than a date if l'm asking.

18:01.050 --> 18:03.245
Well, l'll have to get back to you.

18:03.319 --> 18:09.554
Do so. But tarry not. There are legions
of honeys who would have your place.

18:09.992 --> 18:13.189
Goodbye, George. l've got a class.

18:25.941 --> 18:28.239
Relax. lt's coming.

18:39.188 --> 18:40.553
Very good.

18:41.156 --> 18:44.819
Were all my students like you,
l would be an even happier man.

18:44.894 --> 18:49.092
l don't need false flattery, Asagai.
l do quite well with the truth.

18:51.133 --> 18:54.933
Well, then, l guess l shall tell you the truth.

18:55.804 --> 18:57.669
You are not very good.

19:00.142 --> 19:01.803
You are excellent.

19:05.714 --> 19:07.045
You really think so?

19:07.116 --> 19:09.516
Yes. l am happy with you.

19:18.727 --> 19:23.460
l would be even happier if l could take you
out on one of your dates.

19:25.701 --> 19:26.895
A date?

19:27.970 --> 19:30.234
lsn't that what you call it here
when a man and a woman

19:30.306 --> 19:32.501
go out to spend time together?

19:33.976 --> 19:36.001
Well, yes, but...

19:36.478 --> 19:41.279
Okay, before you crush my spirit and ego,
l will withdraw the offer.

19:42.151 --> 19:45.018
Maybe your phone number
will not be so precious.

19:45.087 --> 19:48.386
Well, l suppose a phone number can't hurt.

20:06.976 --> 20:10.377
l remember well the things
most important to me.

20:15.451 --> 20:17.510
l have a class.

20:34.903 --> 20:38.566
You got any more apples in the back?
lt's been a while since these last saw a tree.

20:38.640 --> 20:40.335
Don't think so.

20:40.409 --> 20:43.310
But you can't be sure unless you check,
right?

20:44.613 --> 20:47.548
-How many you want?
-A dozen of your best.

20:48.951 --> 20:52.045
Excuse me. Do me a favor,
get me a basket of fresh apples.

20:52.121 --> 20:54.385
-Right away, ma'am.
-Thank you.

20:55.891 --> 20:58.826
Lena, you sure was up and out early
this morning.

20:58.894 --> 21:01.192
lt was my last day on the job, Earline.

21:01.263 --> 21:03.823
My last half-day, to be exact.

21:03.899 --> 21:06.663
-Go on. You stopped working?
-Yes, indeed.

21:06.735 --> 21:09.465
-Praise God.
-Yes, l do.

21:09.538 --> 21:12.200
l know l can't wait to lay these
bones down and relax.

21:12.274 --> 21:16.608
-The day'll come.
-Sure came in high style for you.

21:16.678 --> 21:18.043
What with your insurance money.

21:18.113 --> 21:20.308
Well, l can't argue with that.

21:20.382 --> 21:22.407
-Here you go.
-Thank you.

21:26.255 --> 21:28.883
Am l being charged for the worms, too?

21:29.291 --> 21:32.727
You don't want them, moms,
you don't have to buy them.

21:33.962 --> 21:37.056
l'm not buying them. l don't want them.

21:38.167 --> 21:40.135
And l'm not your mother.

21:41.603 --> 21:43.503
There are other stores.

22:00.556 --> 22:01.955
-Hi.
-Hello.

22:03.525 --> 22:05.186
You wanna try one?

22:18.607 --> 22:21.542
Oh, no, Ruth. No, l got this.
Go on, now. Go on, now.

22:21.610 --> 22:23.510
l have been carrying these
groceries clear across town.

22:23.579 --> 22:26.377
l can make it from the door to the table.

22:26.748 --> 22:28.943
Well, how was your last day?

22:30.252 --> 22:33.415
About the same as the first,
far as l can remember.

22:33.489 --> 22:37.016
Well, it must feel good, hanging it all up.

22:37.092 --> 22:39.083
lt ain't settled in good, yet.

22:39.161 --> 22:42.460
lt will, come Monday morning when you
ain't getting up at the crack of dawn.

22:42.531 --> 22:43.896
You'll feel it.

22:43.966 --> 22:46.491
Look at that poor bed.

22:46.568 --> 22:49.366
That's his idea of making it up, l guess.

22:50.038 --> 22:52.233
Bless his heart. He tries, don't he?

22:52.307 --> 22:56.471
No, he don't half-try at all, 'cause he know
you gonna come right behind him

22:56.545 --> 22:58.672
and fix everything, just like you always do.

22:58.747 --> 23:00.578
That's how come he don't know
how to do nothing around here.

23:00.649 --> 23:02.082
You done spoil that boy so.

23:02.151 --> 23:04.244
Well, he's a little boy.

23:04.319 --> 23:07.379
He ain't supposed
to know about housekeeping.

23:10.058 --> 23:11.650
You okay, Ruth?

23:12.895 --> 23:15.227
Yeah, l'm fine, just...

23:15.297 --> 23:18.425
l'm just tired, l've been ironing all morning.

23:18.500 --> 23:21.333
Well, leave the rest for me. l'll finish.

23:22.070 --> 23:24.061
ls that what you call retirement?

23:24.139 --> 23:26.664
You gonna come home so you can
start doing somebody else's work.

23:26.742 --> 23:31.475
Well, what do you expect me to do,
sit in that chair all day till l grow root?

23:32.981 --> 23:34.812
My poor little plant.

23:35.317 --> 23:39.879
lf that plant don't get more sunlight than
it's been getting, it's just gonna give up.

23:42.724 --> 23:45.921
Ruth, if you ain't feeling better tomorrow
than you feel today, you best stay home.

23:45.994 --> 23:48.656
That woman will have a fit
if l don't show up with her ironing.

23:48.730 --> 23:50.561
Well, let her have it.

23:50.632 --> 23:52.896
What? You ain't never supposed to be sick?

23:52.968 --> 23:55.300
l'll call her in the morning
and tell her you got the flu.

23:55.370 --> 23:56.359
Why the flu?

23:56.438 --> 24:00.204
White folks understand about the flu,
that's something they get.

24:00.275 --> 24:02.641
Well, you better call up them sick
with something familiar,

24:02.711 --> 24:04.576
otherwise they gonna think
you were late out drunk,

24:04.646 --> 24:07.342
been caught up in a fight or something.

24:08.684 --> 24:12.120
Tired as you look, Ruth,
you ain't going nowhere tomorrow.

24:12.187 --> 24:15.645
Well, l've got to go, now.
We need the money.

24:15.791 --> 24:21.855
Most days, we might. But tomorrow
we got us a great, big old check coming.

24:22.030 --> 24:23.998
Now, wait, that's your money, Lena.

24:24.066 --> 24:27.035
lt ain't got nothing to do with me.
And we all feel that way.

24:27.102 --> 24:28.899
$10,000.

24:30.172 --> 24:32.766
You know what you ought to do
with that money, Lena?

24:32.841 --> 24:38.905
You ought to go off somewhere,
like South America or Europe.

24:39.014 --> 24:41.710
Just go on off and have yourself a ball
for once in your life.

24:41.783 --> 24:44.274
What would l look like,
wandering around Europe by myself?

24:44.353 --> 24:48.380
What? Those rich white women do it.
l read about it all the time.

24:48.457 --> 24:52.052
Their feet gets itching, and the next thing
you know, they're packed and gone,

24:52.127 --> 24:55.062
waving at the rest of us
from them ocean liners.

24:55.163 --> 24:58.599
Something always told me
l wasn't no rich white woman.

25:03.705 --> 25:06.833
Well, what you going to do with it?

25:06.908 --> 25:09.775
l ain't rightly decided, Ruth,
to tell you the truth.

25:09.845 --> 25:12.211
Well, of course, there is that money
for Beneatha's medical schooling.

25:12.281 --> 25:16.479
And that much is decided,
'cause Big Walter would have wanted that.

25:16.551 --> 25:19.850
-Yeah.
-He believed in dreams, that man did.

25:20.756 --> 25:23.657
And none of his never saw fit to come true.

25:25.394 --> 25:28.557
He used to come in here some nights,
he'd be so low.

25:29.598 --> 25:34.126
Just sit down on that sofa here,
he'd look at the rug,

25:34.336 --> 25:39.535
then he'd look at me,
then he'd look back at the rug.

25:40.575 --> 25:43.408
l know that must've been hard
for the two of you.

25:43.478 --> 25:45.742
The hardest thing for me was watching him.

25:45.814 --> 25:50.979
And when we lost that baby, l near to
thought l was going to lose that man, too.

25:52.688 --> 25:54.713
You'd never think one man could
grieve so much.

25:54.790 --> 25:57.020
That man loved his children.

25:57.726 --> 25:59.660
Now, of course that ain't to say
he was no saint or nothing,

25:59.728 --> 26:03.630
'cause could be a little mean
and kind of wild with the women.

26:03.699 --> 26:06.259
But he loved his children.

26:06.968 --> 26:08.959
He used to say,

26:09.037 --> 26:13.440
''Seem like God didn't seem fit
to give the black man nothing but dreams,

26:14.042 --> 26:18.172
''but he did give us children
to make them dreams seem worthwhile.''

26:20.215 --> 26:22.649
He could talk like that, you know.

26:26.355 --> 26:31.918
Well, look like maybe you remembered
you had a home to come back to.

26:32.027 --> 26:34.222
l started my guitar lessons, today.

26:34.296 --> 26:36.287
-Holy Lord.
-You started your what now?

26:36.365 --> 26:39.823
Guitar.
You know, an instrument with six strings.

26:39.901 --> 26:42.836
l know what a guitar is, little smart mouth.

26:42.904 --> 26:44.132
ls this something new?

26:44.206 --> 26:47.369
Not really. lt's something l've been
wanting to do for some time.

26:47.442 --> 26:50.502
How long is it gonna be before you get
tired of this thing and move on to the next,

26:50.579 --> 26:53.605
like you done that little play-acting group
you was all stirred up about last year?

26:53.682 --> 26:55.912
And the horseback riding club
the year before that.

26:55.984 --> 26:57.975
l've seen butterflies do less flitting, baby.

26:58.053 --> 27:01.284
l just want to learn to play the guitar.
ls there anything wrong with that?

27:01.356 --> 27:03.517
Ain't nobody trying to stop you.

27:03.592 --> 27:05.651
Just wondering why you got to flit so.

27:05.727 --> 27:08.628
Never landing on nothing long enough
to have nothing to sink in.

27:08.697 --> 27:11.063
Never done nothing with all that
camera equipment you brought in here.

27:11.133 --> 27:14.830
l don't flit. l experiment
with different forms of expression.

27:14.903 --> 27:16.734
Does that include horseback riding lessons?

27:16.805 --> 27:19.501
Yes. People have to express themselves
in one way or another.

27:19.574 --> 27:21.337
Well, what is it you're trying to express?

27:21.410 --> 27:22.536
Me.

27:26.515 --> 27:29.848
That's all right. l wouldn't expect you
to understand, for God's sake.

27:29.918 --> 27:31.886
-Beneatha.
-Would you just listen to her?

27:31.953 --> 27:32.942
Oh, God.

27:33.021 --> 27:35.489
lf you use the Lord's name in vain
just one more time...

27:35.557 --> 27:38.424
-Mama.
-Girl, you are fresh as salt.

27:38.493 --> 27:40.518
Well, if the salt loses its savor...

27:40.595 --> 27:41.857
That'll do now.

27:41.930 --> 27:45.331
Not gonna have you round here reciting
the Scriptures in vain, you hear me?

27:45.400 --> 27:47.595
How did l manage
to get on everybody's wrong side

27:47.669 --> 27:49.694
just by just walking into a room?

27:49.771 --> 27:51.705
-Where are you going?
-Got a date.

27:51.773 --> 27:53.638
Oh, my, my. Who with?

27:53.708 --> 27:55.539
Who else? George Murchison.

27:56.478 --> 27:59.709
That's the third time this month.
This one seems to be sticking.

27:59.781 --> 28:02.978
Like a tick on a dog. They don't have
tweezers big enough to get him off me.

28:03.051 --> 28:05.849
Now, girl, you know you're sweet on him.

28:05.921 --> 28:08.355
He's all right. l mean l like him enough
to go out with and stuff.

28:08.423 --> 28:10.288
''And stuff''? What's ''and stuff'' mean?

28:10.358 --> 28:12.451
Stop picking on her, now, Ruth.

28:12.527 --> 28:13.994
What does it mean?

28:14.062 --> 28:17.031
l just mean l could never be serious
about George. He's so shallow.

28:17.098 --> 28:20.226
What do you mean he's shallow?
Girl, he's rich.

28:20.335 --> 28:22.030
You wouldn't even begin to understand.

28:22.103 --> 28:25.368
Anybody who married Walter
couldn't possibly understand.

28:25.440 --> 28:27.670
Now, what kind of way is that
to talk about your brother?

28:27.742 --> 28:30.267
l do believe she just expressed
an insult to me.

28:30.345 --> 28:32.609
Brother is a blip, Mama. Let's face it.

28:32.681 --> 28:33.705
What's a blip?

28:33.782 --> 28:35.773
l don't know. l think she's saying he's crazy.

28:35.851 --> 28:38.376
Not crazy. Brother isn't really crazy yet.

28:38.453 --> 28:40.250
He's an elaborate neurotic.

28:40.322 --> 28:41.721
You hush your mouth, now.

28:41.790 --> 28:44.315
As for George, well, George looks good,

28:44.392 --> 28:47.725
he drives a beautiful car,
takes me to nice places.

28:47.796 --> 28:50.321
But if the Youngers are waiting
to see if their little Bennie is going to

28:50.398 --> 28:52.559
tie up the family with the Murchisons,
they're wasting their time.

28:52.634 --> 28:53.794
-Why?
-Ruth,

28:53.869 --> 28:57.134
the Murchisons are honest-to-God,
real live, rich colored folk.

28:57.205 --> 28:59.867
And the only people in the world
more snobbish than rich white people

28:59.941 --> 29:02.000
are rich colored people. And that's a fact.

29:02.077 --> 29:04.910
You weren't brought up to dislike people
'cause they're well off.

29:04.980 --> 29:07.949
Don't worry about it, Lena.
She'll get over all of this.

29:08.016 --> 29:11.110
Get over it? What're you talking about Ruth?

29:12.821 --> 29:16.348
Listen, l'm going to be a doctor. l'm not
worried about who l'm going to marry yet.

29:16.424 --> 29:17.891
lf l even ever get married.

29:17.959 --> 29:18.983
-lf?
-lf?

29:19.060 --> 29:22.826
l probably will. lt's just that,
first, l'm going to be a doctor.

29:22.898 --> 29:24.889
And George, for one,
still thinks that's pretty funny.

29:24.966 --> 29:26.593
l couldn't be bothered with that.

29:26.668 --> 29:29.899
l'm going to be a doctor, and everybody
around here better understand that.

29:29.971 --> 29:32.565
Well, of course you're gonna be a doctor,
honey. God willing.

29:32.641 --> 29:34.734
God doesn't have a thing to do with it.

29:34.809 --> 29:36.709
Now that just wasn't necessary, Beneatha.

29:36.778 --> 29:39.372
Well, neither is God.
l get sick of hearing about God.

29:39.447 --> 29:40.846
-Beneatha.
-l mean it.

29:40.916 --> 29:42.747
l'm just tired of hearing
about Him all the time.

29:42.817 --> 29:45.081
What does He have to do with anything?
Does He pay tuition?

29:45.153 --> 29:46.814
You about to get
your fresh little jaw slapped.

29:46.888 --> 29:48.014
That's just what she needs.

29:48.089 --> 29:51.354
Why can't l say what l want to
around here like everybody else?

29:51.426 --> 29:53.758
'Cause you weren't brought up
to talk that way.

29:53.828 --> 29:57.264
Me and your daddy went to a lot of trouble
to see that you and Walter

29:57.332 --> 29:59.061
were brought up in the good Christian way.

29:59.134 --> 30:01.432
Well, you and Daddy were wrong.

30:02.070 --> 30:05.665
Mama, you don't understand.
lt's all just a matter of ideas

30:05.740 --> 30:08.265
and God is just one idea l don't accept.

30:08.343 --> 30:12.473
lt's not important. lt's not like l'm gonna
go out and be immoral or commit crimes

30:12.547 --> 30:16.483
'cause l don't believe in God.
l don't even think about it. lt's just...

30:16.551 --> 30:19.179
l get so tired of Him getting credit
for all the things

30:19.254 --> 30:21.279
the human race achieves
through its own stubborn effort.

30:21.356 --> 30:23.756
There is simply no God.

30:23.825 --> 30:27.090
There is only man,
and it is he who makes miracles.

30:34.369 --> 30:36.860
Now, you say after me,

30:36.938 --> 30:39.839
''ln my mother's house, there is still God.''

30:41.776 --> 30:45.109
''ln my mother's house, there is still God.''

30:45.180 --> 30:47.910
ln my mother's house, there is still God.

30:51.353 --> 30:55.050
There are some ideas
we just ain't gonna have in this house.

30:55.123 --> 30:56.988
Not as long as l'm head of this family.

30:57.058 --> 30:58.423
Yes, ma'am.

31:12.807 --> 31:14.206
Bennie.

31:15.410 --> 31:18.971
You think you're a grown woman,
but you're still a little girl.

31:19.047 --> 31:23.848
What you did was childish
and so you got treated like a... Like a child.

31:47.342 --> 31:49.139
She said she's sorry.

31:56.618 --> 31:59.348
l don't know about these children, Ruth.

32:00.021 --> 32:02.114
They frightens me.

32:02.190 --> 32:04.351
Lena, you got good children.

32:05.293 --> 32:08.888
Sometimes, they don't think clearly,
but you got good children.

32:09.931 --> 32:12.661
No, something done come down
between us.

32:12.734 --> 32:15.294
We don't understand each other, no more.

32:15.603 --> 32:19.039
lt's like we don't none of us
speak the same language.

32:19.641 --> 32:23.509
Walter near done lost his mind
thinking about money all the time,

32:23.578 --> 32:27.514
and Beneatha around here talking
about things l just don't understand.

32:27.582 --> 32:29.641
What is it, Ruth? What is it that's changing?

32:29.718 --> 32:32.380
You just got strong-willed children.

32:33.555 --> 32:38.015
And it takes someone with a strong head
like you to keep them in line.

32:40.695 --> 32:45.462
lt's a good thing, though,
you helping Beneatha with her school.

32:45.533 --> 32:48.093
This doctor thing sure is
a dream of hers, huh?

32:48.169 --> 32:51.104
Yeah, well, she deserves it.

32:51.840 --> 32:55.367
Even with all her foolishness,
she work hard in school.

32:56.144 --> 33:02.276
And Walter, well, it's not like you to think
about one child without helping the other.

33:02.951 --> 33:06.387
l understand, Ruth,
but we ain't no business people.

33:06.454 --> 33:08.046
We just plain working folk.

33:08.123 --> 33:12.890
Walter Lee says ain't nobody
business people until they go into business.

33:13.795 --> 33:16.787
Walter Lee says the colored people ain't
never going to get anywhere in this world

33:16.865 --> 33:20.596
until they start gambling
on some different kinds of things.

33:21.069 --> 33:23.060
lnvestments and things.

33:23.138 --> 33:25.470
What done got into you, girl?

33:26.040 --> 33:29.032
Walter Lee done finally sold you
on investing?

33:30.345 --> 33:31.437
No.

33:34.282 --> 33:35.374
No.

33:40.922 --> 33:42.082
Lena, some...

33:44.692 --> 33:50.153
Something done come down
with me and Walter Lee.

33:52.167 --> 33:53.896
l don't know what it is.

33:55.470 --> 34:01.773
He needs something, you know?
Something l can't give him.

34:05.346 --> 34:07.371
He needs this chance, Lena.

34:08.283 --> 34:12.344
l hear you, Ruth,
and l take what you say to heart.

34:13.621 --> 34:17.853
But l can't throw my husband's
insurance money away on no investment.

34:19.928 --> 34:21.862
This poor little plant.

34:22.697 --> 34:24.460
Nothing l do make it no better.

34:24.532 --> 34:28.400
l mean do we even know
what he's talking about investing in?

34:28.469 --> 34:29.561
Ruth?

34:36.811 --> 34:39.541
l think it's the way to go, man, liquor stores.

34:39.614 --> 34:43.014
People gonna always wanna get
their taste, you know what l mean?

34:43.083 --> 34:44.551
That's my feeling exactly.

34:44.619 --> 34:47.746
Without fail, there are two businesses
you'll find in any city.

34:47.822 --> 34:49.187
Churches and liquor stores.

34:49.257 --> 34:51.350
And funeral parlors.

34:52.226 --> 34:54.320
But l ain't messing around
with no dead people.

34:54.395 --> 34:56.192
Until you become one.

34:58.132 --> 34:59.258
Where's Willy, man?

34:59.334 --> 35:01.495
Don't worry, man. He'll be here.
You know Willy.

35:01.569 --> 35:03.503
Always got to make a stop
or two on the way.

35:03.571 --> 35:06.335
There he is. Willy. Over here.

35:06.407 --> 35:10.810
My man, Bobo. How you doing, brother?
Walter, good to see you again.

35:10.879 --> 35:11.937
Willy.

35:12.013 --> 35:14.504
My new partners
and you started without me.

35:14.916 --> 35:17.441
Waitress, another round of suds, please.

35:17.518 --> 35:18.507
What'll you have, Willy?

35:18.586 --> 35:22.852
Scotch, rocks and
another one on the side, beautiful.

35:24.826 --> 35:27.727
-So, Bobo, how's it hanging, man?
-Man, you know me.

35:27.795 --> 35:31.094
Just another squirrel in the world
trying to get a nut.

35:31.165 --> 35:34.999
-So we ready to discuss business?
-That's why we're here, ain't it?

35:35.603 --> 35:37.036
l think we're sold on this liquor store.

35:37.105 --> 35:41.565
Sold? l'd say
it's a can't-miss investment, Walter.

35:41.643 --> 35:46.512
Look around you. Everybody in here's
sipping on some kind of liquid refreshment.

35:47.448 --> 35:51.509
Black folks. They may not have
enough money to rub two nickels together,

35:51.586 --> 35:54.521
but drink they're gonna do. Got to do it.

35:54.589 --> 35:57.786
-Takes their mind off things.
-We was just talking about that.

35:57.859 --> 36:01.761
All right, here's the deal.
l talked to some people in Springfield.

36:01.829 --> 36:05.822
The right people that'll seed the right
pockets to get our license approved.

36:05.900 --> 36:07.299
They don't have no problems with it.

36:07.368 --> 36:08.665
That's what l'm talking about.

36:08.736 --> 36:10.135
And here's the beautiful part.

36:10.204 --> 36:14.197
l found the perfect location,
right here on the Southside. l mean...

36:21.616 --> 36:25.484
l mean, we couldn't build us
a better situation than this.

36:25.620 --> 36:27.247
So, how much time we got?

36:27.322 --> 36:29.620
Well, here's the thing.

36:29.958 --> 36:33.917
This perfect spot ain't likely
to be available after next week.

36:33.995 --> 36:37.988
Personally, l think we need
to move on this by Monday.

36:38.066 --> 36:40.466
l don't see no problem with that.

36:42.403 --> 36:44.234
Well, then,

36:44.305 --> 36:45.738
sounds like a deal.

36:45.807 --> 36:47.001
Cheers.

36:51.646 --> 36:53.443
-l got to run.
-What?

36:53.514 --> 36:55.505
You cats know how to reach me.

36:55.583 --> 36:58.609
-Your change.
-Keep it, sweetheart,

36:59.253 --> 37:01.744
and set my partners up
for the rest of the night.

37:01.823 --> 37:03.051
-Bobo.
-Thanks, Willy.

37:03.124 --> 37:04.318
-Walter.
-Willy.

37:04.392 --> 37:06.383
l'll see you cats later.

37:07.495 --> 37:08.689
Gentlemen.

37:09.697 --> 37:12.165
Nothing for me. l got to get home.

37:12.233 --> 37:14.394
l think l'm going to hang around
for a little a bit, man.

37:14.469 --> 37:16.801
You know, kind of celebrate the future.

37:16.871 --> 37:18.532
Don't you get in no trouble.

37:18.606 --> 37:20.597
-l'm gonna call you later.
-All right.

37:43.631 --> 37:46.361
Morning, doll. We'll be right with you.

37:46.701 --> 37:48.862
l'm looking for Miss Tilly.

37:48.936 --> 37:51.530
What you want with Miss Tilly?

37:51.606 --> 37:54.200
lt's personal. ls she here?

37:56.377 --> 37:59.642
l am Miss Tilly. What you need, child?

38:06.587 --> 38:08.282
Come. Follow me.

38:13.561 --> 38:16.928
Can't l go outside, grandma?
That spray stuff stinks.

38:16.998 --> 38:18.625
lf l can't go out, you can't go out.

38:18.699 --> 38:20.894
-You finish all your chores?
-No.

38:20.968 --> 38:23.801
Where did Mama go?
She said she wasn't going to work today.

38:23.871 --> 38:25.805
She went to run a little errand.

38:25.873 --> 38:27.033
But where?

38:27.108 --> 38:30.544
To tend to her business.
Grown-up business.

38:30.611 --> 38:32.272
-What kind of grown up...
-Travis, get out of here.

38:32.346 --> 38:34.337
Just get out of here. Go on downstairs.

38:34.415 --> 38:37.213
Stay out front and keep a sharp look out
for the mailman.

38:37.285 --> 38:38.616
Yes, ma'am.

38:38.786 --> 38:42.153
And leave them cockroaches alone.
What they ever do to you?

38:42.223 --> 38:44.783
Don't spray that boy with that stuff.

38:45.793 --> 38:50.753
Why not? lt's harmless. You ever see
a dead cockroach around here?

38:52.200 --> 38:53.929
Where did Ruth go, Mama?

38:54.001 --> 38:55.992
To the doctor, l think.

38:56.070 --> 38:57.537
What for?

38:57.705 --> 39:00.401
Beneatha, get up underneath
that couch over there.

39:00.475 --> 39:02.466
Sometimes crumbs get up underneath there.

39:02.543 --> 39:05.512
-Mama?
-What? l don't know.

39:06.714 --> 39:10.013
-At least, l ain't saying what l think.
-You think she's...

39:10.084 --> 39:13.349
l think l ain't saying,
ain't that what l just said?

39:14.422 --> 39:17.448
Of course, l ain't never
been wrong about a woman.

39:24.232 --> 39:25.699
Hello.

39:27.368 --> 39:29.996
Bah-oh to you, Asagai.

39:31.739 --> 39:33.832
Come over? Now?

39:34.609 --> 39:37.339
l don't think so. We're cleaning,
and my mother hates it

39:37.411 --> 39:41.279
when people come over and the house
isn't up to her standards.

39:41.616 --> 39:44.176
Do you? For me?

39:46.020 --> 39:48.045
Okay, if just for a minute.

39:48.322 --> 39:49.914
l'll see you then.

39:49.991 --> 39:52.482
Tell me you didn't just invite
somebody over?

39:52.560 --> 39:54.323
Oh, Mama, it's just Asagai.

39:54.395 --> 39:57.762
l don't care if it's Santa Claus, girl.
Ain't you got no pride? Look at this place.

39:57.832 --> 39:59.356
The place is fine, Mama.

39:59.433 --> 40:03.301
Besides, it's just Asagai.
He's not judgmental. He's an intellectual.

40:03.371 --> 40:07.137
-Who?
-Asagai. Joseph Asagai.

40:07.208 --> 40:09.904
l met him at school. He's from Nigeria.

40:11.479 --> 40:13.640
l don't believe l never met no African before.

40:13.714 --> 40:16.740
Well, do me a favor and please don't ask
him any ignorant questions like

40:16.817 --> 40:18.478
do they wear clothes and carry spears.

40:18.553 --> 40:21.351
lf we so ignorant, maybe you ought
not to be inviting people here.

40:21.422 --> 40:23.720
Mama, it's not that. lt's just
that people ask such crazy questions

40:23.791 --> 40:26.157
when it comes to Africa,
like all they know is Tarzan.

40:26.227 --> 40:28.388
-Well, him, l heard of.
-See?

40:28.462 --> 40:32.728
What? What? What l need to know
anything about Africa for?

40:33.634 --> 40:36.034
Because it's part of our heritage.

40:36.971 --> 40:39.064
Why do you give money
at the church for missionary work?

40:39.140 --> 40:40.630
That's to save people.

40:40.708 --> 40:44.906
l'm afraid they need more salvation
from the British and the French.

40:46.981 --> 40:49.108
So? You pregnant?

40:50.851 --> 40:53.445
What, is it written all over my face?

40:53.621 --> 40:55.919
-You are.
-Oh, Lord have mercy.

40:55.990 --> 40:58.083
How far along are you?

40:58.159 --> 40:59.558
Two months.

41:01.429 --> 41:04.125
Did you plan it or was it an accident?

41:04.198 --> 41:05.460
Mind your own business.

41:05.533 --> 41:09.162
lt is my business.
Where's it going to sleep, on the roof?

41:14.809 --> 41:16.140
l'm sorry.

41:17.645 --> 41:20.546
l didn't mean for it to come out like that.

41:21.315 --> 41:23.374
l think it's wonderful.

41:23.451 --> 41:26.716
Yeah. Yeah, no, it's wonderful.

41:27.655 --> 41:28.986
Well, it is.

41:29.056 --> 41:30.887
Doctor say everything going to be all right?

41:30.958 --> 41:34.416
Yeah. She said everything's gonna be fine.

41:34.495 --> 41:35.553
She?

41:37.565 --> 41:39.465
What doctor you went to?

41:42.670 --> 41:46.470
Ruth, honey, you sick?

41:47.375 --> 41:49.707
What's the matter with her, Mama?

41:49.777 --> 41:51.438
She gonna be all right.

41:51.512 --> 41:53.412
Women get like this sometimes
when they get with child.

41:53.481 --> 41:55.039
But they going to be all right.

41:55.116 --> 41:58.643
They just got to relax
and put everything out their mind.

42:04.992 --> 42:07.324
Oh, my God. That must be Asagai.

42:09.764 --> 42:13.029
Come on, honey. Come on.
lt's going to be all right.

42:31.819 --> 42:33.286
Hello, Alaiyo.

42:33.354 --> 42:34.582
Hello.

42:36.057 --> 42:37.615
May l come in?

42:37.692 --> 42:41.856
Yeah, come in.
Please don't mind how the place looks.

42:41.929 --> 42:44.227
My mother was very upset,

42:44.298 --> 42:47.392
she know l was letting
someone seeing it like this.

42:48.002 --> 42:50.800
You, too, look disturbed.
Look, if it's not a good time, l can...

42:50.871 --> 42:54.773
No, no, no.
lt's never a good time around here.

42:55.743 --> 42:59.144
Acute ghetto-itis is all it is. lt'll pass.

42:59.847 --> 43:00.836
Well.

43:01.015 --> 43:03.347
So, come in and sit down.

43:03.784 --> 43:05.445
Can l hope that box is for me?

43:05.519 --> 43:07.714
Yes. Open it.

43:25.339 --> 43:30.333
-Nigerian music. Thank you.
-Tribal Yoruba. But, keep going.

43:34.749 --> 43:38.583
lt's beautiful. Why did you...

43:42.590 --> 43:44.387
Let me...

43:57.538 --> 44:01.440
-What's it mean?
-You wear it well, as l knew you would.

44:01.509 --> 44:03.238
-You did?
-Of course.

44:04.044 --> 44:07.070
From the moment l first saw you at school,
and you pranced up to me

44:07.148 --> 44:09.810
in the most serious of tones, and said,
''Mr. Asagai,

44:09.884 --> 44:12.148
''l would like very much like
to talk to you about Africa,

44:12.219 --> 44:14.983
''because l am looking for my identity.''

44:15.856 --> 44:17.790
And why is that funny?

44:18.826 --> 44:21.761
Well, because l didn't at first believe it.

44:22.496 --> 44:23.929
And why not?

44:25.666 --> 44:28.191
Because assimilationism is so

44:28.269 --> 44:32.171
popular, so important in your country
among the blacks and whites.

44:32.239 --> 44:34.867
Everyone must become one
and melt into each other.

44:34.942 --> 44:37.137
l am not an assimilationist.

44:40.681 --> 44:41.943
Perhaps not.

44:46.120 --> 44:47.883
So, do you like them?

44:47.955 --> 44:49.650
-What?
-The robes.

44:49.723 --> 44:51.657
They are from my sister's
personal wardrobe, you know.

44:51.725 --> 44:52.749
You must take good care of them.

44:52.827 --> 44:54.954
-Your sister?
-Yes, from Lagos.

44:55.029 --> 44:58.521
That's the capital. But you knew that.

44:59.834 --> 45:01.961
You sent all the way for me?

45:02.536 --> 45:05.061
Well, l cannot wear them.

45:06.407 --> 45:08.068
Joseph.

45:09.510 --> 45:12.536
For you, l would do much more.

45:19.119 --> 45:20.746
l must be going.

45:21.322 --> 45:23.756
Will you call me Monday?

45:23.824 --> 45:27.851
Yes, l will. We do have much to talk about.

45:28.028 --> 45:33.591
About identity and time and feeling.

45:35.736 --> 45:39.103
What sort of feeling
are you talking about, Asagai?

45:39.173 --> 45:43.166
l am not interested in being
someone's little episode in America.

45:46.914 --> 45:50.372
-Yes, that's real funny, isn't it?
-Truthfully, yes.

45:51.151 --> 45:55.747
Every American girl, white, black and brown,
have said the same thing to me.

45:55.823 --> 45:58.121
You are all the same with the same speech.

45:58.192 --> 46:01.286
lt seems the world's most liberated women
are not so liberated at all

46:01.362 --> 46:04.593
or you wouldn't so quickly
jump to the same conclusions.

46:07.768 --> 46:12.068
Mama. Mama, this is Mr. Asagai.

46:12.139 --> 46:14.869
How do you do, young man?

46:14.942 --> 46:17.911
How do you do, Mrs. Younger?

46:17.978 --> 46:20.776
Please forgive me for coming
at such an inconvenient time.

46:20.848 --> 46:22.372
That's all right.

46:22.449 --> 46:25.850
l just hope that you understand
our house don't always look like this.

46:25.920 --> 46:28.445
-Asagai was just leaving, Mama.
-Yeah.

46:28.722 --> 46:30.883
Well, l do hope that you'll come again.

46:30.958 --> 46:35.657
l would love to hear more
about your country.

46:36.497 --> 46:40.024
l think it's sad the way our American
Negroes don't know nothing about Africa,

46:40.100 --> 46:42.830
except Tarzan and all that.

46:42.903 --> 46:45.770
And all that money we been giving
to them churches,

46:45.873 --> 46:48.501
when we need to be helping
you all get liberated from them

46:48.576 --> 46:52.273
Englishmen and Frenchmen
what done taken away your land.

46:54.181 --> 46:58.413
Well, yes, ma'am. And on behalf
of my people, we appreciate it.

46:59.386 --> 47:02.378
Well, l suspect you better come around here
from time to time,

47:02.456 --> 47:04.390
get yourself a home-cooked meal.

47:04.458 --> 47:06.790
l think your mama would like that.

47:07.294 --> 47:11.856
l think my mother would like that,
Mrs. Younger. And thank you.

47:14.101 --> 47:18.162
Well, l should be off.
l will call you Monday, Alaiyo.

47:18.238 --> 47:21.469
What is that? That's African for Beneatha?

47:21.542 --> 47:23.669
No, it's a Yoruba word.

47:23.777 --> 47:26.041
lt means, well, roughly,

47:26.113 --> 47:29.776
one for whom bread or food is not enough.

47:30.184 --> 47:34.348
You are never satisfied. You are always
hungry for more. That is you.

47:34.421 --> 47:39.256
That's nice. Well, do come again, Mr...

47:39.326 --> 47:43.660
Asagai. Or Joseph would do as nicely.

47:45.132 --> 47:46.394
Goodbye.

47:59.613 --> 48:03.344
Well, that's a pretty young thing
just walked out of here.

48:04.218 --> 48:05.207
Well,

48:05.786 --> 48:08.812
l guess l see why we done give up
horseback riding

48:08.889 --> 48:11.551
and play-acting and cameras

48:11.625 --> 48:15.083
and commenced to get so interested
in Africa.

48:15.162 --> 48:16.254
Mama.

48:18.298 --> 48:20.391
Missionaries, my Aunt Jenny.

48:28.909 --> 48:30.604
What you doing up?

48:31.145 --> 48:34.478
Ain't nothing wrong with me
to be lying in no bed for.

48:36.950 --> 48:39.885
-lt's 10:30.
-Yes, it's 10:30.

48:40.988 --> 48:44.014
And the mailman going to come today
just like he come every day.

48:44.091 --> 48:46.559
-He's here. Two doors down.
-Lord have mercy.

48:46.627 --> 48:50.290
Get on down them steps,
and make sure you don't lose that check.

48:50.364 --> 48:54.664
-You mean, he done finally come.
-Lena, what a day this is?

48:54.735 --> 48:56.566
Well, l don't know what
we getting so excited about.

48:56.637 --> 48:58.332
We known for months he was coming.

48:58.405 --> 49:01.033
Knowing it's coming and knowing it's here,
there's a difference.

49:01.108 --> 49:04.908
lmagine being able to hold a piece of paper
in your hand worth $10,000.

49:05.646 --> 49:10.208
-l'll take our mail, Mr. Peete.
-l don't think l have anything for you, Travis.

49:10.284 --> 49:13.845
You got to have a letter, Mr. Peete.
Grandma's been waiting for months.

49:15.155 --> 49:19.091
l think l have something for your grandma.
l just don't got nothing for you.

49:22.529 --> 49:23.518
Got it!

49:23.797 --> 49:26.357
Lord have mercy,
l wish Walter Lee was here.

49:26.433 --> 49:28.424
Come on, open it. Come on, now, open it.

49:28.502 --> 49:31.164
All right, all right, all right, child,
don't act silly now.

49:31.238 --> 49:33.433
We never been no people
to act silly about no money.

49:33.507 --> 49:36.874
Well, Lena, we ain't never had
no money before. Now open it.

49:39.246 --> 49:41.373
ls that the right amount of zeros?

49:44.818 --> 49:50.256
Yes, ma'am. You're rich, Grandma. Rich.

49:51.492 --> 49:53.289
$10,000.

49:57.631 --> 50:00.532
Somebody's idea
of what my Walter was worth.

50:13.847 --> 50:17.613
What's the matter with Grandma, Mama?
She don't want to be rich?

50:20.020 --> 50:22.818
Why don't you go on outside and play,
baby. Go.

50:38.806 --> 50:41.673
lf it wasn't for you all,
l'd just put that money away,

50:41.742 --> 50:43.141
or give it to the church or something.

50:43.210 --> 50:45.974
Lena, that's crazy talk, and you know it.

50:46.146 --> 50:49.138
And Mr. Younger
would tell you the same thing.

50:51.385 --> 50:52.875
Yes, he would.

50:55.222 --> 50:57.213
Big Walter would tell me good.

50:58.592 --> 51:01.857
Yeah. We got enough to do with that money,
all right.

51:01.929 --> 51:03.328
Yeah.

51:03.397 --> 51:05.388
Where'd you go today, girl?

51:05.933 --> 51:07.662
l went to the doctor.

51:07.868 --> 51:10.894
Dr. Jones does have
some strange ways about him,

51:11.772 --> 51:14.900
but turning from a he to a she
ain't one of them.

51:15.576 --> 51:17.305
l don't know what you're talking about,
Lena.

51:17.377 --> 51:22.110
Ruth. Ruth, look at me. Look at me, Ruth.

51:23.717 --> 51:25.912
l'm the same Lena Younger
you've known all these years,

51:25.986 --> 51:28.716
and l didn't suddenly turn into no fool.

51:28.989 --> 51:33.050
Now, you called the doctor that
you went to see this morning a she.

51:33.126 --> 51:37.563
-Well, l made a mistake.
-You went to see that woman, didn't you?

51:39.233 --> 51:42.031
-What woman?
-You went to see that woman...

51:42.102 --> 51:43.194
Did the check come?

51:43.270 --> 51:45.170
Now, what you doing here
this hour of the day?

51:45.239 --> 51:47.002
Can you say hello
when you walk into the room?

51:47.074 --> 51:48.507
Did it come?

52:05.559 --> 52:07.459
Our lives have changed.

52:13.066 --> 52:17.002
Look, Mama. Here's the agreement
between me, Willy Harris and Bobo.

52:17.070 --> 52:18.435
All in written up. All legal-like.

52:18.505 --> 52:20.939
Son, l think you need to talk to your wife.
l will leave you two alone.

52:21.008 --> 52:23.272
-Now, what l need to talk to her for? Mama...
-Son, talk to your wife.

52:23.343 --> 52:25.208
Mama, look.
Why can't anybody ever listen to me?

52:25.279 --> 52:27.338
Walter Lee.

52:27.414 --> 52:31.009
l don't allow no yelling in this house,
and you know that.

52:31.084 --> 52:32.176
Okay.

52:32.519 --> 52:34.953
Okay, see, Mama, no yelling.

52:38.191 --> 52:41.718
Now everything's ready.
All signed and executed.

52:42.596 --> 52:45.895
We even got a name
for the business. Southside Liquors.

52:48.368 --> 52:49.562
Liquor!

52:52.306 --> 52:56.800
ls that what this has been about
the whole time? A liquor store?

52:56.877 --> 52:58.174
Mama, it's a great investment.

52:58.245 --> 52:59.769
Listen to me, boy, and you listen good.

52:59.846 --> 53:02.007
There ain't gonna be no investing
in no liquor stores.

53:02.082 --> 53:03.572
Not as long as there is a breath in this body.

53:03.650 --> 53:06.585
-Mama...
-l don't want to talk about it no more.

53:06.653 --> 53:09.588
But, Mama,
you haven't even looked at it yet.

53:10.590 --> 53:13.354
Mama, you haven't even looked at it yet.

53:21.535 --> 53:22.866
That's it?

53:24.805 --> 53:26.432
You've decided.

53:27.374 --> 53:30.172
Decided that this is the way
we're gonna live.

53:36.717 --> 53:37.877
Will you tell that to my boy tonight

53:37.951 --> 53:41.045
when you put him to sleep
on the living room sofa?

53:41.121 --> 53:45.820
Will you tell that to my wife when she's
slaving over somebody's dirty laundry?

53:46.426 --> 53:48.394
Will you tell it to yourself, Mama,

53:48.462 --> 53:50.794
when you're fixing food
in somebody's kitchen

53:50.864 --> 53:53.856
that your own family
can't even afford to eat?

53:58.405 --> 54:00.305
-Walter, where are you going?
-l'm going out.

54:00.374 --> 54:03.002
-l'll come with you.
-l don't want you to come.

54:03.076 --> 54:05.510
Walter, l got to talk to you about something.

54:05.579 --> 54:07.240
That's too bad.

54:07.314 --> 54:09.782
Walter Lee, sit down.

54:10.517 --> 54:11.609
l'm a grown man, Mama.

54:11.685 --> 54:15.416
Ain't nobody said you wasn't grown.
But you still in my house and my presence,

54:15.489 --> 54:17.980
and as long as you are,
you will talk to your wife civil.

54:18.058 --> 54:20.151
-Now sit down.
-No, let him go on.

54:20.227 --> 54:24.357
-He makes me sick to my stomach.
-And you turn mine, too, baby.

54:26.633 --> 54:28.191
Walter Lee.

54:28.268 --> 54:31.032
That was my biggest mistake.

54:31.104 --> 54:34.096
-What is wrong with you?
-Ain't nothing wrong with me.

54:34.174 --> 54:38.577
Yes, there is something wrong with you.
You're being eating up like a crazy man.

54:38.645 --> 54:41.876
And it's something more than me not giving
you this money. This ain't new.

54:41.948 --> 54:45.782
For the past two years l've been watching
you get all nervous, acting wild in the eyes.

54:45.852 --> 54:47.843
-l gotta go out.
-l'm not finished talking to you.

54:47.921 --> 54:49.582
l don't need your nagging right now, Mama.

54:49.656 --> 54:52.853
So what you gonna do?
Go somewhere and drink?

54:52.926 --> 54:55.656
Seems like you always
tied up in a knot about something.

54:55.729 --> 54:59.324
Ready to bust out and yell
anytime anybody say anything to you.

54:59.399 --> 55:01.765
People can't live like that, Walter.

55:01.835 --> 55:06.966
Ruth is a good and patient girl in her way,
but you getting to be too much, son.

55:07.040 --> 55:10.134
Don't make the mistake
of driving that girl away from you.

55:10.210 --> 55:14.010
What mistake? What she ever do for me?

55:14.114 --> 55:16.776
That girl loves you, Walter.

55:20.020 --> 55:21.920
Now you through?

55:21.988 --> 55:25.981
'Cause if it's all right with you,
l would like to go out, please.

55:26.059 --> 55:27.549
l'm sorry, son.

55:27.627 --> 55:31.290
l'm sorry about your liquor store.
But that just ain't the thing for us to do.

55:31.364 --> 55:33.298
l gotta go out, Mama.

55:33.366 --> 55:35.596
-That's dangerous son.
-What's dangerous?

55:35.669 --> 55:38.832
That. When a man got to go
outside his house to look for peace.

55:38.905 --> 55:40.372
Where else am l gonna find it?

55:40.440 --> 55:43.705
-Not in this place.
-What is it, son? What's wrong?

55:45.011 --> 55:47.309
Mama, l want so many things.

55:47.881 --> 55:51.112
Mama, l want so many things.
lt's kind of driving me crazy.

55:51.184 --> 55:53.049
What is it that you want, baby?

55:53.120 --> 55:57.523
You got a nice wife,
a fine boy, you got a job.

55:57.591 --> 56:02.324
A job? A job, Mama? Mama.

56:02.395 --> 56:04.795
l open and close car doors all day.

56:05.799 --> 56:08.893
l drive a man around
that looks right through me.

56:08.969 --> 56:13.497
l say ''Yes, sir. No, sir.
Shall l take the drive, sir?

56:13.573 --> 56:16.838
''Am l the best trained monkey
you ever seen, sir?''

56:17.777 --> 56:21.508
Mama, that ain't no kind of job.
That ain't nothing.

56:25.852 --> 56:28.685
Why do l even think
you going to understand me?

56:28.788 --> 56:31.552
Understand what, baby?

56:33.593 --> 56:34.582
Mama.

56:36.363 --> 56:39.423
Sometimes when l'm driving
that man around,

56:39.499 --> 56:42.093
and we passing them cool,
fancy restaurants,

56:42.169 --> 56:44.433
and these white boys,
these white boys they've just been there

56:44.504 --> 56:48.167
talking about things, important things,

56:48.241 --> 56:50.607
they closing million-dollar deals,
l know they are.

56:50.677 --> 56:54.636
And, Mama, these white boys,
they don't look much older than me.

56:55.248 --> 56:57.478
So, once again, it's money.

56:57.551 --> 57:00.452
This is about money, because money is life.

57:01.521 --> 57:03.614
Money is life?

57:05.025 --> 57:07.994
l remember a time
when freedom used to be life.

57:08.061 --> 57:11.758
But now, it's money?
Have times changed that much?

57:11.831 --> 57:15.323
No, they haven't changed.
lt's always been about money.

57:15.402 --> 57:17.802
We were just never allowed
to get close enough to see it.

57:17.871 --> 57:20.601
No, something has changed.

57:22.375 --> 57:25.344
ln my time, if we could make it
to the North without being lynched

57:25.412 --> 57:28.745
and still have a shred of dignity, too,
that was enough.

57:30.517 --> 57:31.882
But now here come you and Beneatha,

57:31.952 --> 57:35.388
you all talking about things
that just go right past me.

57:35.455 --> 57:39.858
Now you my children but sometimes
you all might as well be strangers.

57:39.926 --> 57:41.894
Mama, you don't understand.

57:43.330 --> 57:45.525
You probably never will.

57:46.099 --> 57:49.262
Son, you know your wife's
expecting another baby?

57:50.170 --> 57:51.194
What?

57:51.271 --> 57:55.674
Now, l know it ain't my business
to be saying this, but you need to know.

57:56.343 --> 57:58.777
'Cause l think Ruth is thinking
about getting rid of it.

57:58.845 --> 58:01.643
You don't know Ruth, Mama, if you think
she would do something like that.

58:01.715 --> 58:03.774
Yes, l would, too, Walter.

58:04.918 --> 58:06.715
l already made plans.

58:07.954 --> 58:08.943
What?

58:10.824 --> 58:13.054
Gave the woman a down payment.

58:22.969 --> 58:25.870
Well, son, it's your turn to say something.

58:29.643 --> 58:32.908
And l'm waiting to see
how you be your father's son.

58:33.747 --> 58:37.979
'Cause your wife is saying,
she thinking about destroying your child.

58:38.485 --> 58:41.386
l'm waiting to hear your father in you speak

58:41.454 --> 58:45.015
and say we a people who give life,
not who take it away.

58:47.627 --> 58:49.026
l'm waiting.

58:54.301 --> 58:58.829
l'm waiting to see you stand up
and be the man your daddy was.

59:05.512 --> 59:09.778
Well, if you a son of mine, tell her.

59:18.658 --> 59:21.491
You a disgrace to your father's memory.

59:55.662 --> 59:57.152
Well, now.

59:57.230 --> 01:00:01.894
Yes, now. This, my assimilated sister-in-law,

01:00:01.968 --> 01:00:05.062
is what the well-dressed
Nigerian woman wears.

01:00:05.839 --> 01:00:07.534
lsn't it beautiful?

01:00:08.641 --> 01:00:12.543
Well, yeah, it is something.

01:00:13.680 --> 01:00:14.908
lt is.

01:00:17.384 --> 01:00:19.978
Enough of this assimilationist junk.

01:00:51.618 --> 01:00:53.142
What kind of dance is that?

01:00:53.219 --> 01:00:55.050
A folk dance.

01:00:55.121 --> 01:00:56.986
And what kind of folks
dance like that, honey?

01:00:57.056 --> 01:01:00.025
Nigerian folks... People.

01:01:00.093 --> 01:01:02.926
lt's a dance of welcome.

01:01:02.996 --> 01:01:04.861
Who you welcoming?

01:01:06.699 --> 01:01:09.668
The men. Back to the village.

01:01:09.736 --> 01:01:11.499
Yeah. Where they been?

01:01:12.272 --> 01:01:17.073
l don't know.
Out, tending cattle or hunting or something.

01:01:23.316 --> 01:01:26.581
The point is, they're coming home.

01:01:26.653 --> 01:01:29.349
To that? Girl, you better put a pot on.

01:01:47.941 --> 01:01:52.844
Maybe you heard me wrong. l said we're
going to the theater not going to be in it.

01:01:53.546 --> 01:01:55.673
l don't like that, George.

01:01:56.216 --> 01:01:57.979
Have a seat, George.

01:02:00.386 --> 01:02:03.947
Girl, you think this boy's gonna go out
with you looking like that? Get dressed.

01:02:04.023 --> 01:02:08.153
That's up to George.
lf he's ashamed of his heritage...

01:02:08.928 --> 01:02:10.987
Bennie, Bennie, Bennie.
Don't be so proud of yourself

01:02:11.064 --> 01:02:12.759
just because you look eccentric.

01:02:12.832 --> 01:02:16.131
How can something that
feels so natural be eccentric?

01:02:16.202 --> 01:02:18.193
That's what eccentric means, my dear.

01:02:18.271 --> 01:02:21.104
Feeling natural
although you're anything but.

01:02:21.207 --> 01:02:24.074
Go get dressed. l don't want us to be late.

01:02:24.577 --> 01:02:25.805
Don't worry, George.

01:02:25.879 --> 01:02:30.748
l wouldn't expect someone like you
to appreciate great and ancient cultures.

01:02:31.518 --> 01:02:35.147
l know your only aim in life is to utterly
submerge yourself in the dominant

01:02:35.221 --> 01:02:36.711
and, in this case, oppressive culture.

01:02:36.789 --> 01:02:40.225
My, my, my,
aren't we the revolutionary tonight?

01:02:40.293 --> 01:02:45.196
You will lecture me on our great
West African heritage. Let's hear it.

01:02:45.431 --> 01:02:49.561
Expound upon the great Ashanti empires
and the Songhay civilizations.

01:02:50.036 --> 01:02:52.937
Oh, and let's not forget
the brilliance of the sculpture of Benin

01:02:53.006 --> 01:02:55.133
and the poetry of the Bantu.

01:02:56.042 --> 01:02:58.704
Heritage? Let's face it, baby.

01:02:58.778 --> 01:03:02.009
Your heritage is nothing but
a bunch of raggedy-assed spirituals

01:03:02.081 --> 01:03:04.106
and foul-smelling chitlins.

01:03:04.517 --> 01:03:08.351
How comfortable we are
wallowing in our ignorance.

01:03:09.122 --> 01:03:14.150
My people were the first people on earth
to smelt iron.

01:03:14.227 --> 01:03:16.525
The Ashanti
were performing surgical operations

01:03:16.596 --> 01:03:20.692
when the English were still tattooing
themselves with blue dragons.

01:03:22.936 --> 01:03:26.167
She'll be out in a minute, George.

01:03:30.376 --> 01:03:33.743
-What time is the show?
-The curtain is at 8:30.

01:03:34.380 --> 01:03:38.407
Which is a bit earlier than
the standard New York curtain of 8:40.

01:03:41.554 --> 01:03:44.457
-Mama in there?
-No, she's not back yet.

01:03:47.260 --> 01:03:48.693
Do you get to New York a lot?

01:03:48.761 --> 01:03:50.854
-She say where she was going?
-No.

01:03:50.930 --> 01:03:53.228
l get there a few times a year.

01:03:53.366 --> 01:03:55.163
New York ain't got nothing
Chicago ain't got,

01:03:55.234 --> 01:03:57.930
just a bunch more people
all squeezed up together.

01:03:58.004 --> 01:03:59.835
-So, you've been?
-Plenty of times.

01:03:59.906 --> 01:04:01.965
-Walter!
-Plenty.

01:04:02.609 --> 01:04:04.509
Why don't you offer this man
some refreshments?

01:04:04.611 --> 01:04:06.044
They don't know how to entertain here, man.

01:04:06.112 --> 01:04:09.047
l don't really care for anything. Thank you.

01:04:29.168 --> 01:04:31.796
Why you college boys always
wear them silly-looking white shoes?

01:04:31.871 --> 01:04:34.169
-Walter!
-White shoes, cold as it is.

01:04:34.240 --> 01:04:36.538
George, you're gonna have to excuse him.
He's had too much to drink.

01:04:36.609 --> 01:04:37.906
You don't have to excuse me.

01:04:38.678 --> 01:04:41.306
l'll excuse myself if l need excusing.

01:04:41.948 --> 01:04:44.678
l'm just saying they look funny as hell.

01:04:46.319 --> 01:04:49.049
-Well?
-lt's the college style.

01:04:50.590 --> 01:04:53.081
Style, my ass. Boy, you're something.

01:04:58.598 --> 01:05:02.534
l hear your old man is about to buy
that big hotel over there on the drive.

01:05:02.669 --> 01:05:07.299
That's a shrewd move.
See, your old man's like me, he thinks big.

01:05:08.508 --> 01:05:11.944
Bet you got some of that in you.
Like father, like son.

01:05:12.745 --> 01:05:14.645
Maybe we get together sometime,

01:05:14.781 --> 01:05:17.716
have couple of beers
and talk some business.

01:05:18.651 --> 01:05:20.915
l don't think so, Walter.

01:05:21.287 --> 01:05:24.654
-You don't think what?
-l really don't have the time.

01:05:29.362 --> 01:05:35.267
Okay. l understand.
You just a busy little boy, ain't you?

01:05:35.334 --> 01:05:38.167
-You ain't got the time for people like me.
-What's your problem, Walter?

01:05:38.237 --> 01:05:41.400
You my problem. And people like you.

01:05:41.474 --> 01:05:44.409
Them college boys.
Like that makes you better.

01:05:44.477 --> 01:05:46.206
What they teaching you over there?

01:05:46.279 --> 01:05:48.179
Sociology and psychology?

01:05:49.348 --> 01:05:51.282
They ain't teaching you how to be a man.

01:05:51.350 --> 01:05:54.342
They ain't teaching you how to get out here
and run this world.

01:05:54.420 --> 01:05:57.856
They just teach you how to read
them books and talk proper,

01:05:57.924 --> 01:05:59.516
and wear them sissy-looking white shoes.

01:05:59.592 --> 01:06:02.254
You're all whacked up with bitterness, man.

01:06:02.328 --> 01:06:03.727
And you?

01:06:04.497 --> 01:06:07.022
You ain't got no bitterness in you?

01:06:07.667 --> 01:06:11.262
You don't see no stars out there gleaming
you just can't reach out and grab?

01:06:11.337 --> 01:06:12.736
You happy?

01:06:13.439 --> 01:06:16.169
You contented son-of-a-bitch.
You got it made.

01:06:16.242 --> 01:06:18.472
You had the world handed to you
on a silver platter.

01:06:18.544 --> 01:06:20.569
You damn right, l'm bitter.

01:06:20.980 --> 01:06:26.111
Man, l'm a volcano.
l'm a giant. A giant surrounded by ants.

01:06:27.353 --> 01:06:30.254
Ants can't even understand
what the giant is talking about.

01:06:30.323 --> 01:06:31.756
Walter, ain't you with nobody?

01:06:31.824 --> 01:06:34.816
Hell, no. 'Cause there ain't nobody with me.

01:06:36.295 --> 01:06:38.195
Not even my own mother.

01:06:41.601 --> 01:06:43.626
Ready.

01:06:43.703 --> 01:06:45.603
And do you look great!

01:06:47.874 --> 01:06:50.138
You all have a nice time.

01:06:50.209 --> 01:06:51.574
See y'all later.

01:06:52.512 --> 01:06:55.606
-Bye-bye.
-Thank you.

01:06:58.518 --> 01:07:00.543
-Walter.
-Don't start.

01:07:01.254 --> 01:07:02.516
Start what?

01:07:02.588 --> 01:07:05.148
Your nagging. Where was l?

01:07:05.858 --> 01:07:09.021
Who was l with?
How much money did l spend?

01:07:09.095 --> 01:07:11.120
Walter, honey,
can't we just try and talk about this?

01:07:11.197 --> 01:07:13.495
l was out talking with people
who understand me.

01:07:13.566 --> 01:07:15.534
People who care about the things
l got on my mind.

01:07:15.601 --> 01:07:18.331
-l guess that means people like Willy Harris.
-Yes, people like Willy Harris.

01:07:18.404 --> 01:07:21.430
Well, then why don't y'all just go on into
business and quit talking about it?

01:07:21.507 --> 01:07:23.134
Why? You want to know why?

01:07:23.209 --> 01:07:25.006
'Cause we all tied to a race of people

01:07:25.077 --> 01:07:29.309
that don't know how to do nothing
but moan, and pray and have babies.

01:07:33.719 --> 01:07:37.382
-Honey, why can't you stop fighting me?
-Who's fighting you?

01:07:38.457 --> 01:07:40.448
Who even cares about you?

01:07:54.006 --> 01:07:59.672
Well, l guess l just didn't realize
how bad things was between us.

01:08:09.155 --> 01:08:12.352
l just didn't realize that
somewhere we lost it.

01:08:21.701 --> 01:08:22.929
l am sorry.

01:08:24.837 --> 01:08:27.465
l'm sorry about this new baby, Walter.

01:08:41.921 --> 01:08:43.821
You want some hot milk?

01:08:44.490 --> 01:08:46.515
With all that liquor you come home with,
you ought to have

01:08:46.591 --> 01:08:49.584
-something hot in your stomach.
-No, l don't want no hot milk.

01:08:49.662 --> 01:08:52.062
-You want some coffee?
-No, l don't want no coffee.

01:08:52.131 --> 01:08:54.531
-l don't want no hot milk.
-Then what?

01:08:55.667 --> 01:08:56.760
What?

01:08:56.836 --> 01:09:02.035
What else can l give you, Walter?
What? What? What can l give you?

01:09:29.935 --> 01:09:32.268
lt's been rough, ain't it, baby?

01:09:32.939 --> 01:09:35.305
Between two people,

01:09:35.374 --> 01:09:38.935
there ain't as much understanding
as folks generally think there is.

01:09:39.011 --> 01:09:41.309
l mean, like between me and you.

01:09:46.752 --> 01:09:50.813
How we gets to a place where we scared
to talk softness to each other?

01:09:52.758 --> 01:09:56.125
What gets into people
who ought to be close?

01:10:05.004 --> 01:10:06.471
l don't know.

01:10:09.675 --> 01:10:13.873
Lately, l been thinking about it a lot.

01:10:17.950 --> 01:10:20.009
On account of you and me, you mean?

01:10:20.086 --> 01:10:22.714
The way something come down between us.

01:10:22.788 --> 01:10:25.655
Walter, there ain't so much between us.

01:10:26.525 --> 01:10:30.518
Not when you come to me
and you try and talk to me.

01:10:30.596 --> 01:10:35.693
Just try and be with me, a little, even.

01:10:40.639 --> 01:10:42.436
Sometimes...

01:10:44.243 --> 01:10:47.007
Sometimes, l don't even know how to try.

01:10:48.814 --> 01:10:50.304
Walter.

01:10:53.119 --> 01:10:57.249
Walter, baby.
Things don't got to be like this.

01:10:57.323 --> 01:10:59.086
No, Walter.

01:11:00.960 --> 01:11:05.590
Sometimes people can do things
so that things are better.

01:11:09.635 --> 01:11:14.095
You remember the way we used to talk
before Travis was born?

01:11:15.141 --> 01:11:18.702
Remember, about the way
we was going to live?

01:11:19.478 --> 01:11:20.911
You remember?

01:11:20.980 --> 01:11:23.744
And the kind of house
we was going to have?

01:11:23.816 --> 01:11:25.511
-l remember.
-Yeah.

01:11:29.121 --> 01:11:32.113
Walter, it's all starting to slip away from us.

01:11:38.064 --> 01:11:39.395
l'm sorry.

01:11:53.145 --> 01:11:57.548
Oh, my! That bus stop seems
further away at night.

01:11:57.616 --> 01:11:59.311
Where you been all day, Mama?

01:11:59.385 --> 01:12:01.285
How you feeling, honey?

01:12:02.154 --> 01:12:04.315
-Where have you been all day?
-Where's Travis?

01:12:04.390 --> 01:12:05.516
What, he ain't out front?

01:12:05.591 --> 01:12:09.152
-l didn't see him.
-That boy is gonna get it.

01:12:09.228 --> 01:12:10.286
Mama.

01:12:11.464 --> 01:12:13.329
Yes, Walter.

01:12:13.399 --> 01:12:15.128
Where were you?

01:12:15.201 --> 01:12:17.567
-l went downtown.
-What's downtown?

01:12:19.605 --> 01:12:22.802
l had a little business to attend to.

01:12:22.875 --> 01:12:24.843
What kind of business?

01:12:25.044 --> 01:12:28.036
Come on, now. You know better
than to question me like that.

01:12:28.114 --> 01:12:30.742
Mama, you ain't go do nothing crazy
with that insurance money, did you?

01:12:30.816 --> 01:12:33.011
-Mama, l was only next door.
-Mama, nothing.

01:12:33.085 --> 01:12:36.179
l have told you a thousand times not to go
running off like that. Now you get in there.

01:12:36.255 --> 01:12:37.984
Well, at least let me tell him something.

01:12:38.057 --> 01:12:41.754
lt's important, and l want him
to be the first to hear. Travis.

01:12:42.228 --> 01:12:45.288
Travis, baby, now you remember that money
that come in the mail this morning,

01:12:45.364 --> 01:12:47.161
that money that got everybody so excited?

01:12:47.233 --> 01:12:48.257
Yes, ma'am.

01:12:48.334 --> 01:12:51.531
What you think your grandma went
and done with that money?

01:12:51.604 --> 01:12:53.629
l don't know, Grandma.

01:12:53.706 --> 01:12:56.402
-She went and bought you a house.
-What?

01:12:57.376 --> 01:13:00.345
lt's gonna be yours
when you get to be a man.

01:13:01.547 --> 01:13:03.037
You glad?

01:13:04.583 --> 01:13:07.882
Well, yes, ma'am.
l always wanted to live in a house.

01:13:07.953 --> 01:13:12.322
Well, now you can start.
Give me some sugar.

01:13:13.392 --> 01:13:15.519
Now when you say your prayers tonight,

01:13:15.594 --> 01:13:19.553
you can thank God and your grandfather,

01:13:19.632 --> 01:13:22.965
'cause it was both of them
what give you the house.

01:13:26.839 --> 01:13:28.807
Now go on, get in there.

01:13:28.874 --> 01:13:30.341
-Mama.
-Go on.

01:13:37.583 --> 01:13:41.610
-So, you went and did it.
-Yes. Yes l did.

01:13:43.055 --> 01:13:45.114
Praise God.

01:13:50.029 --> 01:13:51.326
Walter, honey.

01:13:52.565 --> 01:13:57.764
Walter, please. Let me be glad, Walter.
Walter, you be glad, too.

01:13:58.304 --> 01:14:00.067
Walter, it's a home.

01:14:06.245 --> 01:14:08.042
How big is it?

01:14:08.113 --> 01:14:10.081
Where is it? How much it cost? Wait. Wait.

01:14:10.149 --> 01:14:11.616
When are we moving?

01:14:11.684 --> 01:14:13.413
First of the month.

01:14:13.686 --> 01:14:16.348
Praise God! Praise God!

01:14:16.422 --> 01:14:19.414
And it's a nice house, too. Three bedrooms.

01:14:19.491 --> 01:14:20.958
A big one for the two of you.

01:14:21.026 --> 01:14:23.290
Of course, me and Beneatha,
we still got to share a room,

01:14:23.362 --> 01:14:24.886
but Travis will have a room of his own.

01:14:24.964 --> 01:14:27.159
And l was thinking that
if the new baby was a boy,

01:14:27.233 --> 01:14:29.565
we could get one of them
double-decker outfits.

01:14:29.635 --> 01:14:32.866
And there's a yard where maybe
l get to grow myself a little something,

01:14:32.938 --> 01:14:34.599
and a basement, and...

01:14:35.908 --> 01:14:38.775
Look, l don't mean to make it sound
fancier than it is.

01:14:38.844 --> 01:14:41.677
lt's just a plain little old house.

01:14:42.314 --> 01:14:43.975
But it will be ours.

01:14:44.383 --> 01:14:49.252
And it makes a difference in a man when
he can walk on floors that belong to him.

01:14:56.095 --> 01:14:57.585
Where is it?

01:14:59.164 --> 01:15:01.064
lt's in Clybourne Park.

01:15:02.167 --> 01:15:03.657
ln Clybourne Park?

01:15:03.736 --> 01:15:06.569
Lena, there ain't no colored people
living in Clybourne Park.

01:15:06.639 --> 01:15:08.732
Well, there's gonna be some, now.

01:15:08.807 --> 01:15:12.243
So that's the peace and comfort
you went out and bought for us today?

01:15:12.311 --> 01:15:16.475
l just tried to find the nicest place
for the least amount of money.

01:15:18.317 --> 01:15:20.046
Now, mind you,

01:15:20.119 --> 01:15:22.451
l ain't never been one
to be afraid of no crackers,

01:15:22.521 --> 01:15:24.421
but, Lena, wasn't there no other houses?

01:15:24.490 --> 01:15:26.515
-You mean for the colored?
-Yeah.

01:15:26.592 --> 01:15:29.288
There was lots of them,
way out yonder, somewhere,

01:15:29.361 --> 01:15:32.125
in worse shape and cost more money. No.

01:15:32.197 --> 01:15:34.097
l did the best l could.

01:15:41.206 --> 01:15:43.936
All l can say then is...

01:15:44.009 --> 01:15:47.172
This is my time in life to say goodbye...

01:15:49.548 --> 01:15:54.110
Say goodbye to these cracking walls,

01:15:54.186 --> 01:15:57.952
and these marching cockroaches

01:15:58.023 --> 01:16:02.960
and the cramped little closet that ain't now
or never was no excuse for a kitchen.

01:16:03.028 --> 01:16:06.361
l'm gonna say it good and loud. Hallelujah!

01:16:08.634 --> 01:16:11.626
Goodbye, misery.

01:16:11.704 --> 01:16:14.764
l don't never want to see
your ugly face again.

01:16:27.920 --> 01:16:30.218
l'm gonna go see about Travis.

01:16:31.390 --> 01:16:34.848
Lord, l sure don't feel like
whipping nobody tonight.

01:16:38.697 --> 01:16:41.359
Son, you understand what l done, right?

01:16:46.772 --> 01:16:50.640
l seen my family falling apart
right in front of my eyes today.

01:16:51.343 --> 01:16:54.471
We was talking about killing babies
and wishing each other was dead.

01:16:54.546 --> 01:16:59.381
When it gets like that, somebody's got to
do something different. Something big.

01:16:59.885 --> 01:17:02.285
Come on, son.

01:17:03.922 --> 01:17:08.416
Come on. Won't you say how, deep inside,
you know l done the right thing?

01:17:11.764 --> 01:17:14.597
What you need me to say
you done right for?

01:17:15.734 --> 01:17:17.895
You the head of this family.

01:17:19.104 --> 01:17:22.835
lt was your money
and you did what you wanted to do with it.

01:17:22.908 --> 01:17:25.900
So what you need me to say
you done right for?

01:17:26.745 --> 01:17:29.339
So you butchered up a dream of mine.

01:17:29.615 --> 01:17:34.052
You, who always talking about
your children's dreams.

01:17:36.555 --> 01:17:38.648
Walter Lee. Walter, wait.

01:17:38.724 --> 01:17:40.191
Wait, Walter.

01:17:57.943 --> 01:17:59.274
Hi, sugar.

01:18:19.198 --> 01:18:21.894
Walter, we're closing.
Back open at 10:00, all right?

01:19:02.040 --> 01:19:06.773
You got to eat, honey. lt's more than just
yourself you're eating for, remember?

01:19:10.649 --> 01:19:14.346
He'll be back.
l know my son. He'll come home.

01:19:19.892 --> 01:19:21.052
Hello.

01:19:23.395 --> 01:19:27.297
Hello, Mrs. Arnold. Yes, this is his mother.

01:19:29.501 --> 01:19:32.937
Well, l'm sure he just thought
he was off today, and...

01:19:35.040 --> 01:19:38.009
Yes, l'll be sure and tell him. l will.

01:19:39.745 --> 01:19:41.269
Yes, thank you.

01:19:44.917 --> 01:19:47.249
Walter Lee didn't show up for work.

01:19:47.319 --> 01:19:50.777
lf he don't go in by tomorrow,
he's gonna lose his job.

01:19:53.392 --> 01:19:55.690
lt's gonna be all right, honey.

01:19:56.895 --> 01:19:58.886
lt's gonna be all right.

01:20:12.477 --> 01:20:13.910
l'll be back.

01:20:32.861 --> 01:20:37.389
-Good morning. Can l help you?
-No, you've done enough.

01:20:39.401 --> 01:20:40.663
Let's go.

01:20:44.372 --> 01:20:47.773
You are gonna follow me out of here,
Walter Lee.

01:20:49.477 --> 01:20:50.876
Right now.

01:21:25.513 --> 01:21:27.208
Take over for me.

01:21:41.529 --> 01:21:44.020
Take off everything and put on this.

01:22:06.321 --> 01:22:09.950
Sure hope we don't get
no whole bunch of snow this winter.

01:22:11.259 --> 01:22:14.558
l never saw snow till coming up here
to the States.

01:22:14.762 --> 01:22:17.458
Don't have such a nonsense in Kingston.

01:22:21.402 --> 01:22:24.371
l laugh now when l think about how,
growing up,

01:22:24.439 --> 01:22:27.169
we used to complain for the cold.

01:22:27.242 --> 01:22:32.339
Child, l didn't know ''cold''
until l move up here to Chicago.

01:22:34.949 --> 01:22:38.441
lt's like we went straight from the fire
to the freezer.

01:22:56.538 --> 01:22:59.098
You go ahead and put on that robe, huh?

01:23:00.074 --> 01:23:01.939
l'll be back directly.

01:24:01.869 --> 01:24:04.064
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

01:24:05.940 --> 01:24:07.999
Where you been, Walter?

01:24:08.543 --> 01:24:13.003
-l know you ain't been to work.
-l been out, Mama. Just out.

01:24:13.081 --> 01:24:16.073
So, that's it?
You done come full circle, now?

01:24:16.818 --> 01:24:17.842
Next time l come looking for you,

01:24:17.919 --> 01:24:21.411
l'm gonna find you laid out
drunk in the gutter or worse.

01:24:22.790 --> 01:24:24.985
You got hurt and pain in you?

01:24:26.027 --> 01:24:29.360
You think you the only colored man
in Chicago with hurt?

01:24:29.430 --> 01:24:30.954
The only man?

01:24:32.200 --> 01:24:34.725
Well, l used to know a man
who knew how to live with his hurt

01:24:34.802 --> 01:24:36.929
and make his pain work for him.

01:24:37.005 --> 01:24:42.341
And he knew trials you don't begin to know,
but he did it with dignity.

01:24:43.778 --> 01:24:46.372
l was married to that man, Walter.

01:24:46.881 --> 01:24:51.648
And as l knew your father, l know you.
You two are not that different.

01:24:56.324 --> 01:25:00.055
Forty years ago, Mama, you left the South.
Why'd you do it?

01:25:01.062 --> 01:25:03.963
Why'd you leave
the only place you ever knew?

01:25:04.032 --> 01:25:07.661
Well, for the same reason
most folks up here did, l suspect.

01:25:07.735 --> 01:25:11.193
To find something better,
to make more of myself.

01:25:11.272 --> 01:25:13.433
But it wasn't like l was gonna
set the world on fire.

01:25:13.508 --> 01:25:16.773
But you came.
You didn't let nobody stop you.

01:25:16.844 --> 01:25:18.004
'Cause nobody else had the right to tell you

01:25:18.079 --> 01:25:21.276
that what you wanted to do
was right or wrong.

01:25:21.749 --> 01:25:24.582
You had to come, didn't you, Mama?

01:25:26.888 --> 01:25:28.753
You got on your train.

01:25:29.724 --> 01:25:34.127
So why in God's name wouldn't you let me
get on mine when the time came?

01:25:36.831 --> 01:25:41.791
l'm missing it, Mama,
and l don't think it's coming back again.

01:25:52.714 --> 01:25:55.706
l gave the man $3,500 on the house.

01:26:00.922 --> 01:26:03.584
Well, that leaves $6,500.

01:26:05.026 --> 01:26:10.464
l want you to put $3,000 in
the savings account for Bennie's schooling

01:26:10.531 --> 01:26:14.126
and the rest l want you
to put into a checking account

01:26:15.803 --> 01:26:17.600
with your name on it.

01:26:18.606 --> 01:26:21.769
And then you decide what to do with it.

01:26:22.543 --> 01:26:25.808
Now, l know that's not as much
as you wanted,

01:26:25.880 --> 01:26:27.848
but it's all l got in this world.

01:26:28.750 --> 01:26:31.378
Well, you the man of the house,
you the head of this family now.

01:26:31.452 --> 01:26:33.784
So l'm gonna leave it up to you.

01:26:35.690 --> 01:26:40.593
-You trust me like that, Mama?
-l ain't never stopped trusting you.

01:26:42.063 --> 01:26:44.691
Just like l'll never stop loving you.

01:26:46.934 --> 01:26:51.428
And you need to go home to your wife
who's worried sick about you.

01:26:52.039 --> 01:26:53.404
Okay, Mama.

01:27:03.618 --> 01:27:07.748
Hello, Mary. lt's Walter Lee.
l'm great, l'm great.

01:27:09.991 --> 01:27:14.553
No, it's not raining where l'm at.
All l see is sunshine and blue skies.

01:27:14.629 --> 01:27:17.462
Bobo in? Yeah, thanks.

01:27:20.902 --> 01:27:26.169
Bobo, my man. Call Willy Harris.
We're back on. Yeah.

01:27:59.941 --> 01:28:05.004
l can't tell you how good this feels, Walter.
Movies and a dance.

01:28:06.981 --> 01:28:10.280
Yeah, you should run away
from home more often.

01:28:12.753 --> 01:28:16.917
l'd be lying to you if l didn't tell you
l was a happy man, Ruth.

01:28:18.259 --> 01:28:20.955
Everything's starting to come together.

01:28:23.497 --> 01:28:26.125
lt's gonna be big. You just watch.

01:28:27.034 --> 01:28:30.936
l'm not gonna say any more.
lt's gonna be big, though.

01:28:33.341 --> 01:28:35.775
-George.
-Come on, Bennie.

01:28:36.510 --> 01:28:40.469
-We're having a nice time. Don't spoil it.
-Can't we just talk?

01:28:55.630 --> 01:28:57.427
George, talk.

01:28:58.399 --> 01:29:02.426
Beneatha, we always talk,
and l don't mind sometimes,

01:29:02.503 --> 01:29:05.870
but there is more to a relationship,
you know?

01:29:06.507 --> 01:29:09.374
So, let's get to the ''more'' part.

01:29:12.480 --> 01:29:15.711
-What do you plan to do, George?
-Do?

01:29:16.684 --> 01:29:19.812
Well, first, l'll put my arm around you,
like this.

01:29:19.887 --> 01:29:22.082
l'm serious, George.

01:29:24.125 --> 01:29:27.822
Okay, l will play along, for a minute.

01:29:29.196 --> 01:29:33.394
l plan to finish college,
then get a job at my dad's company,

01:29:33.467 --> 01:29:36.402
make a lot of money and then get married.

01:29:36.470 --> 01:29:37.767
Happy?

01:29:38.572 --> 01:29:41.097
Care to know about me? What l want?

01:29:43.110 --> 01:29:45.408
l think you'll tell me, anyway.

01:29:47.081 --> 01:29:50.278
-l want to make a difference.
-A difference?

01:29:50.351 --> 01:29:55.618
Yes. l don't want to be like everybody else,
like Mama and Ruth.

01:29:55.756 --> 01:29:59.385
l want to do something with my life.
You know what l mean?

01:30:01.662 --> 01:30:02.856
No.

01:30:04.365 --> 01:30:05.354
Hello.

01:30:05.433 --> 01:30:07.298
l think we should
all go see the house tomorrow

01:30:07.368 --> 01:30:09.632
and Ruth has a great idea. Don't you, babe?

01:30:09.704 --> 01:30:12.400
-Yes, l do.
-You get one, too.

01:30:22.216 --> 01:30:24.946
-Give us a few minutes, please.
-Yes, sir.

01:30:38.199 --> 01:30:40.724
-This must be it.
-Sold. Sold.

01:30:41.902 --> 01:30:42.994
lt's huge.

01:30:43.070 --> 01:30:45.868
Well, now, l never said it was no mansion.

01:30:45.940 --> 01:30:49.637
-Well, why don't we go in?
-A mansion never looked better than this.

01:30:49.710 --> 01:30:54.670
-Lady, what have you done?
-Oh, you'll see. Come on, you'll see.

01:31:05.059 --> 01:31:06.253
Oh, look at this bathroom.

01:31:06.327 --> 01:31:08.261
You said that our bedroom
is up on the right.

01:31:08.329 --> 01:31:12.026
-My own bathroom.
-This is my room, right here.

01:31:12.099 --> 01:31:15.262
-Nobody touch this room.
-No, this is my room. This is...

01:31:15.336 --> 01:31:17.804
-Oh, please...
-This is my room!

01:31:17.872 --> 01:31:20.363
Okay, this is her room.
My goodness gracious me.

01:31:20.441 --> 01:31:21.806
Excuse me.

01:31:24.645 --> 01:31:25.839
-Where is she?
-ln the backyard.

01:31:25.913 --> 01:31:29.041
All right, go on to the taxi and get the stuff.

01:31:30.618 --> 01:31:32.108
Goodness.

01:31:34.822 --> 01:31:36.847
-Look at my kitchen.
-Look at your kitchen.

01:31:36.924 --> 01:31:38.551
My kitchen.

01:31:50.438 --> 01:31:51.962
-Look what l got over here.
-Wait a minute, now.

01:31:52.039 --> 01:31:54.269
-What is all this?
-Oh, l don't know.

01:31:54.341 --> 01:31:58.107
-l have no idea.
-Right here. Right here. Right here.

01:31:58.179 --> 01:32:00.409
Sit right here, Your Highness.

01:32:03.084 --> 01:32:06.019
-We got you a little something.
-Oh, that's lovely.

01:32:07.054 --> 01:32:08.487
Okay.

01:32:12.726 --> 01:32:16.685
Now we won't have to use
our good forks and spoons, Mama.

01:32:17.298 --> 01:32:20.893
Oh, this is wonderful. This is wonderful.

01:32:21.035 --> 01:32:25.529
-Can l go get my gift now, Mama?
-Yes. Yes, before you explode, boy.

01:32:25.673 --> 01:32:28.642
-Oh, my.
-lt's the big one.

01:32:28.709 --> 01:32:30.199
Travis didn't want to go in
with the rest of us, Mama,

01:32:30.277 --> 01:32:32.973
so he went out and got his own gift.

01:32:38.352 --> 01:32:41.412
-Travis.
-Travis, honey, what is that?

01:32:41.489 --> 01:32:44.981
See, it's a gardening hat,
like the ladies wear in the magazines.

01:32:45.059 --> 01:32:46.526
Wait, wait, wait. We gotta take her hat off.

01:32:46.594 --> 01:32:49.154
Now, who was with him when he got that?

01:32:49.230 --> 01:32:53.826
Well, it's different. lt's expressive.
And he picked it out himself.

01:32:55.669 --> 01:32:58.263
-You like it, Grandma?
-Oh, l love it.

01:32:58.339 --> 01:33:02.673
Oh, yes, this is a beautiful hat.
l always wanted me one just like it.

01:33:05.146 --> 01:33:07.876
Mama, you look like you're ready
to go chop some cotton, sure enough.

01:33:07.948 --> 01:33:09.176
Go on, Walter Lee.

01:33:09.250 --> 01:33:13.277
Don't you pay him no mind.
This is a beautiful hat.

01:33:13.354 --> 01:33:16.414
Come on,
let's take these things into the basement.

01:33:16.490 --> 01:33:17.479
Stop laughing.

01:33:17.558 --> 01:33:20.994
We not laughing, Lena.
We're not laughing much.

01:33:23.430 --> 01:33:26.831
lt's been a long time
since l've seen her this happy.

01:33:27.101 --> 01:33:28.728
So, you like it?

01:33:31.138 --> 01:33:32.230
What?

01:33:41.415 --> 01:33:44.009
Come on. Let's just go inside.

01:33:51.959 --> 01:33:55.895
Howdy do, neighbors. Howdy do.

01:33:56.797 --> 01:33:58.094
Howdy do.

01:33:58.966 --> 01:34:01.025
Howdy do.

01:34:02.770 --> 01:34:06.137
Man, if you don't get up... Hey.

01:34:07.308 --> 01:34:09.833
l'm the one
who's supposed to be lying down.

01:34:10.211 --> 01:34:14.944
All in due time, Mrs. Younger.
The leisure life is right around the corner.

01:34:16.684 --> 01:34:20.176
Well, tell it to hurry up. l been ready.

01:34:21.855 --> 01:34:26.292
-Beneatha. Which box has the pots in it?
-ln the crate by the stove.

01:34:26.360 --> 01:34:28.521
No, that crate
has your mother's good China in it.

01:34:28.596 --> 01:34:31.929
-l had a dream about our future.
-Lord, do l want to hear this?

01:34:31.999 --> 01:34:35.662
No, you don't have to hear it.
Soon you gonna be living it.

01:34:39.974 --> 01:34:42.499
-That's nice.
-Come on, now.

01:34:45.246 --> 01:34:48.477
-Come on. Come on, girl.
-Oh, my goodness.

01:34:50.217 --> 01:34:53.584
Let me show you how to dance,
how the rich people dance.

01:34:55.856 --> 01:34:59.348
-Talk about old fashioned Negroes.
-What kind of Negroes?

01:34:59.426 --> 01:35:01.291
Old fashioned.

01:35:03.264 --> 01:35:06.529
Well, if we're old Negroes,
then you one of them new Negroes.

01:35:06.800 --> 01:35:09.064
Yeah, and when the new Negroes
have their convention,

01:35:09.136 --> 01:35:12.162
their first order of business
is going to be to elect Beneatha

01:35:12.239 --> 01:35:15.572
as the Chairman of Unending Agitation.

01:35:15.643 --> 01:35:20.080
Chair-woman
and l will wear the crown proudly.

01:35:20.147 --> 01:35:23.947
Girl, l do believe you are the first person
in the history of the entire human race

01:35:24.018 --> 01:35:26.782
to successfully brainwash yourself.

01:35:27.855 --> 01:35:32.417
l mean, damn,
even the NAACP takes a holiday sometimes.

01:35:32.526 --> 01:35:36.121
l can see this chick now
before she performs one of her operations

01:35:36.196 --> 01:35:39.256
she gonna be leaning over that poor cat,
right before she slices him

01:35:39.333 --> 01:35:44.270
she gonna have the nerve to ask him,
''Sir, what are your views on civil rights?''

01:35:45.372 --> 01:35:46.361
She would, too.

01:35:46.440 --> 01:35:50.411
Sticks and stone may break my bones,
but words will never hurt me.

01:35:51.478 --> 01:35:52.843
How's that?

01:35:57.017 --> 01:35:58.746
-Brother.
-Walter.

01:35:59.620 --> 01:36:03.784
Hello. l'm sorry,
l was knocking and l guess no one...

01:36:05.826 --> 01:36:11.890
l... l'm looking for a Mrs. Lena Younger.

01:36:22.009 --> 01:36:25.172
-Why don't you have a seat, Mr...
-Lindner. Carl Lindner.

01:36:25.913 --> 01:36:27.540
Walter Younger.

01:36:27.614 --> 01:36:31.141
l handle most of my mother's business
and this is my wife, Ruth.

01:36:31.218 --> 01:36:32.845
-How do you do?
-And my sister, Beneatha.

01:36:32.920 --> 01:36:35.787
-Have a seat.
-Why, thank you.

01:36:35.856 --> 01:36:38.154
-Will you be all right?
-That's quite all right, thanks.

01:36:38.225 --> 01:36:42.355
Listen, l represent the Clybourne Park
lmprovement Association.

01:36:42.429 --> 01:36:44.829
Why don't you put your things down,
make yourself more comfortable?

01:36:44.898 --> 01:36:48.834
Why, thank you. Thank you very much.
l'm going to set that right there.

01:36:49.803 --> 01:36:53.671
Like l said, l represent the Clybourne Park
lmprovement Association.

01:36:53.741 --> 01:36:55.834
Would you like something to drink?
Ruth, get this man a beer.

01:36:55.909 --> 01:36:57.467
-You want a...
-No, no, no, no. No thanks.

01:36:57.544 --> 01:36:59.273
No, no. l'm quite all right.
Thank you very much.

01:36:59.346 --> 01:37:02.076
-Sure?
-Yeah, l'm... Really, trust me, l'm fine.

01:37:02.282 --> 01:37:08.551
Now, l'm not so sure how much you folks
know about our little organization.

01:37:08.622 --> 01:37:14.720
But it's a community group that's set up to,
sort of, look out after things basically.

01:37:14.795 --> 01:37:16.023
Like?

01:37:16.897 --> 01:37:21.698
Like block upkeep, special projects.

01:37:21.769 --> 01:37:24.829
We have
a New Neighbors Orientation Committee.

01:37:24.905 --> 01:37:26.031
And what do they do?

01:37:26.106 --> 01:37:30.873
That's sort of a Welcoming Committee,
if you will, and l'm the chairman.

01:37:31.678 --> 01:37:36.138
And we go around and we meet
the new neighbors that are moving in

01:37:36.216 --> 01:37:40.812
and we sort of give them the lowdown
on how we do things in Clybourne Park.

01:37:42.189 --> 01:37:44.123
The lowdown?

01:37:44.191 --> 01:37:49.094
Yeah, and we also have a category,

01:37:49.163 --> 01:37:53.065
what the association calls,
Special Community Problems.

01:37:53.133 --> 01:37:56.466
-And, pray tell, what are some of those?
-Beneatha.

01:37:56.670 --> 01:37:58.501
-Go right ahead.
-Well...

01:37:58.572 --> 01:38:01.507
You don't look comfortable, Mr. Lindner.
Do you want another chair?

01:38:01.575 --> 01:38:03.975
No, no, no, no, no. l'm fine.

01:38:04.044 --> 01:38:06.945
Let me just get to the point.

01:38:07.014 --> 01:38:10.472
l'm sure you're aware
of some of the incidents

01:38:10.551 --> 01:38:13.384
which have happened
in various parts of the city

01:38:13.454 --> 01:38:18.448
where colored people
have moved in to certain areas.

01:38:18.525 --> 01:38:24.930
Now, what we have, l feel,
is a unique organization in American life,

01:38:24.998 --> 01:38:27.523
where we're trying to do something about it.

01:38:27.601 --> 01:38:29.228
l mean, most of the trouble in this world

01:38:29.303 --> 01:38:33.501
is because people don't sit down
with one another and talk to each other.

01:38:33.574 --> 01:38:35.633
-Well, amen to that.
-Yes.

01:38:35.709 --> 01:38:38.075
And that's the way we feel
in Clybourne Park.

01:38:38.145 --> 01:38:43.811
And that's why l was elected to come out
and talk to you people, friendly-like,

01:38:43.884 --> 01:38:46.512
as people should talk to one another,

01:38:46.587 --> 01:38:50.614
and see, you know,
if we could work this thing out.

01:38:52.793 --> 01:38:54.283
Work what out?

01:38:54.361 --> 01:38:56.295
Please, believe me when l say

01:38:56.363 --> 01:39:02.199
race prejudice has absolutely nothing
to do with this.

01:39:02.269 --> 01:39:06.899
lt's just that the folks
in Clybourne Park feel that,

01:39:06.974 --> 01:39:12.378
for the happiness of all concerned,
our Negro families are better off,

01:39:12.446 --> 01:39:15.779
they're happier,
living in their own communities.

01:39:15.849 --> 01:39:18.477
This, friends, is the Welcoming Committee.

01:39:18.552 --> 01:39:20.952
ls this what you came
all the way over here to tell us?

01:39:21.021 --> 01:39:23.216
Well, in the face of what l've just said,

01:39:23.290 --> 01:39:27.021
we are prepared
to make your family a very generous offer.

01:39:27.094 --> 01:39:28.152
Yeah?

01:39:28.228 --> 01:39:32.358
Yes, the association, along with
the collective efforts of our people,

01:39:32.432 --> 01:39:36.232
would like to buy your house back from you
at a financial gain to your family.

01:39:36.303 --> 01:39:40.831
-Lord have mercy. Ain't this the living gall?
-All right, you through?

01:39:40.908 --> 01:39:44.002
What? No, l'd like to give you the exact
terms of the financial agreement, if l may.

01:39:44.077 --> 01:39:45.977
Oh, no, no. We don't need no exact terms
of no agreement.

01:39:46.046 --> 01:39:47.911
Do you really feel...

01:39:47.981 --> 01:39:52.543
No, no. Don't worry about how l feel.
Come on. Get out of my house.

01:39:52.619 --> 01:39:55.144
All right,
what do you people think you have to gain

01:39:55.222 --> 01:39:57.520
by moving into a neighborhood
where you're not wanted?

01:39:57.591 --> 01:40:00.253
You know, people get awful worked up
when they feel their whole way of life,

01:40:00.327 --> 01:40:01.817
everything they ever worked for
is threatened.

01:40:01.895 --> 01:40:03.123
Get out.

01:40:06.300 --> 01:40:10.259
You can't force people to change their heart,
Mr. Younger.

01:40:13.740 --> 01:40:16.937
ln case you change your mind,
you have my card.

01:40:24.051 --> 01:40:25.518
Come on, Grandma, tell me.

01:40:25.586 --> 01:40:29.044
l'm not gonna tell you.
l told you once before, you...

01:40:30.157 --> 01:40:31.784
ls this all the packing
the three of you all got done

01:40:31.858 --> 01:40:33.587
since l left out of here this morning?

01:40:33.660 --> 01:40:36.390
You all got the energy of the dead.
What time the movers due?

01:40:36.463 --> 01:40:38.954
-4:00.
-Well, then what is wrong with you all?

01:40:39.032 --> 01:40:41.830
-You had a caller, Mama.
-Sure enough? Who?

01:40:43.270 --> 01:40:46.034
-The Welcoming Committee.
-The who?

01:40:46.573 --> 01:40:48.541
The Welcoming Committee.

01:40:48.609 --> 01:40:53.478
They said they sure going to be glad
to see you when you get there.

01:40:53.714 --> 01:40:57.650
Yeah they said they can't hardly wait
to see your face.

01:40:57.718 --> 01:40:59.345
What are you all talking about?

01:40:59.419 --> 01:41:03.719
A gentleman stopped by from the Clybourne
Park lmprovement Association.

01:41:03.824 --> 01:41:07.055
-Oh, what he want?
-He wanted to welcome you, Lena.

01:41:07.127 --> 01:41:09.595
See, the one thing they don't have
in their lovely neighborhood

01:41:09.663 --> 01:41:13.190
that they're dying to have,
is a fine family of colored people.

01:41:13.266 --> 01:41:16.167
And he left his card to prove his sincerity.

01:41:20.941 --> 01:41:22.966
Go over there, and pack that stuff.

01:41:23.710 --> 01:41:25.575
-Did he threaten us?
-Oh, no, Mama.

01:41:25.646 --> 01:41:28.444
They don't do it like that anymore.
He talked brotherhood.

01:41:28.515 --> 01:41:31.780
He said we all ought to sit down
and hate each other

01:41:31.852 --> 01:41:33.877
with good Christian fellowship.

01:41:33.954 --> 01:41:35.683
Have mercy.

01:41:36.356 --> 01:41:38.586
They wanted to buy the house back from us.

01:41:38.659 --> 01:41:40.388
At a financial gain to us.

01:41:40.460 --> 01:41:42.587
Why? What do they think we're gonna do?
Eat them?

01:41:42.663 --> 01:41:46.827
-No, honey, marry them.
-Oh, Father, help us.

01:41:46.900 --> 01:41:51.064
-We don't need help, they do.
-No, baby, we all need the help.

01:41:51.138 --> 01:41:53.971
Ain't nobody's going nowhere,
we're all in this world together.

01:41:54.041 --> 01:41:55.474
Not if they can have it their way.

01:41:55.542 --> 01:41:58.238
Mama, you gonna take that
to the new house?

01:41:58.311 --> 01:42:02.645
-Yes, l am.
-That raggedy looking old thing?

01:42:02.716 --> 01:42:06.709
-lt expresses me.
-So, there. Miss Thing.

01:42:08.021 --> 01:42:10.581
We are entering a new tomorrow.

01:42:10.657 --> 01:42:13.524
Mama, you know how it feels
to climb up in a chariot?

01:42:13.593 --> 01:42:15.060
-What?
-You know...

01:42:15.128 --> 01:42:20.156
I got wings, you got wings
AII God's chiIIun got wings

01:42:21.134 --> 01:42:24.331
lt's ''children,'' not ''chillun.''

01:42:26.640 --> 01:42:28.267
Minstrel man.

01:42:28.341 --> 01:42:30.104
Lord, if that man is back...

01:42:30.177 --> 01:42:32.668
-Who is it?
-lt's me, Walter. Can l talk to you?

01:42:32.746 --> 01:42:33.838
No, l got it.

01:42:33.914 --> 01:42:35.848
-You all go pack something.
-Yes, please do something.

01:42:35.916 --> 01:42:38.544
Mama, our future has arrived.

01:42:38.618 --> 01:42:43.385
I got wings, you got wings
AII God's chiIIun got wings

01:42:43.457 --> 01:42:44.446
Bobo.

01:42:45.058 --> 01:42:47.856
-Where's Willy?
-Can we talk, Walter?

01:42:47.928 --> 01:42:50.590
-Yeah, come on, come on in here.
-Alone.

01:42:51.932 --> 01:42:55.265
-Hey, Miss Ruth. Miss Lena.
-Hello, Bobo.

01:43:03.977 --> 01:43:05.535
Be right back.

01:43:10.484 --> 01:43:12.418
Ain't nothing wrong, is there?

01:43:13.520 --> 01:43:15.351
Let me tell you, Walter.

01:43:15.722 --> 01:43:18.919
l gotta tell you. You know how it was?

01:43:20.227 --> 01:43:23.993
lt's all the money we got, me and Mary,
all our savings.

01:43:24.064 --> 01:43:26.225
What are you telling me all this for?

01:43:26.299 --> 01:43:29.962
You know, me and Willy
was supposed to go down to Springfield.

01:43:30.036 --> 01:43:32.197
Yeah, to spread some money around.

01:43:32.272 --> 01:43:36.140
l got a bad feeling about it, Walter,
l got a real bad feeling about it.

01:43:36.209 --> 01:43:38.507
-You saying you didn't go?
-l'm trying to tell you, Walter.

01:43:38.578 --> 01:43:41.342
Then tell me, Bobo.
What's the matter with you?

01:43:41.414 --> 01:43:42.972
-Did you go?
-No.

01:43:43.049 --> 01:43:45.984
-Why not?
-l didn't have no reason to go.

01:43:46.052 --> 01:43:49.146
What are you talking about?
Bobo, you better start making some sense.

01:43:49.222 --> 01:43:51.520
l'm trying to tell you, Walter.

01:43:55.362 --> 01:44:00.129
When l went down to the train station
to meet Willy yesterday, like we planned,

01:44:00.200 --> 01:44:02.998
man, he didn't never show up.

01:44:03.069 --> 01:44:05.003
And he got the money?

01:44:05.539 --> 01:44:08.133
l gave him all the money, like we agreed.

01:44:08.208 --> 01:44:11.439
Why didn't he show up then?
Where was he? Where is he?

01:44:11.511 --> 01:44:13.536
l don't know.

01:44:13.613 --> 01:44:16.047
What you mean you don't know?
Where is he?

01:44:17.083 --> 01:44:23.716
l don't know. l waited for six hours.
l waited till the last train left for Springfield.

01:44:25.559 --> 01:44:29.017
Man, that's...
That's all the money we got in this world.

01:44:33.867 --> 01:44:36.165
Bobo, maybe he went by himself.

01:44:36.703 --> 01:44:39.103
Maybe you missed each other
at the train station.

01:44:39.172 --> 01:44:41.333
He probably got on a earlier train.

01:44:41.408 --> 01:44:43.638
Come on, man,
you know Willy got his own ways.

01:44:43.710 --> 01:44:45.337
-Walter.
-There's no way.

01:44:45.412 --> 01:44:48.939
There's no way, he's gotta be somewhere.
He just gotta be.

01:44:50.250 --> 01:44:52.343
Come on, we gonna find him.

01:44:53.553 --> 01:44:56.784
-Bobo?
-What's the matter with you, Walter?

01:44:58.124 --> 01:45:02.959
When a cat takes off with your money,
he don't leave no map.

01:45:12.072 --> 01:45:15.166
You better be lying. You better be lying!

01:45:15.242 --> 01:45:18.541
There's no way. Willy wouldn't do that.

01:45:19.512 --> 01:45:20.809
No.

01:45:23.483 --> 01:45:25.417
Willy wouldn't do that.

01:45:32.859 --> 01:45:35.953
No. Oh, God.

01:45:36.496 --> 01:45:41.729
No, Willy. Oh, God, don't let it be true.

01:45:41.801 --> 01:45:48.434
God, no, no. Not with that money.
Please, God, not with that money.

01:45:50.010 --> 01:45:52.171
That was all the money we had!

01:45:52.913 --> 01:45:54.778
l'm sorry, Walter.

01:45:56.750 --> 01:46:00.186
-l had my life staked on this deal, too.
-Go!

01:46:36.556 --> 01:46:38.285
ls it gone, son?

01:46:41.161 --> 01:46:42.651
Walter Lee.

01:46:47.334 --> 01:46:48.767
ls it gone?

01:46:48.969 --> 01:46:54.373
-Mama. Mama, l'm sorry. Mama.
-Your sister's money for school.

01:46:54.441 --> 01:46:55.874
No.

01:46:58.011 --> 01:47:00.036
You used that money, too?

01:47:01.748 --> 01:47:04.308
Mama, l never went to the bank at all.

01:47:08.822 --> 01:47:13.816
Mama, it's all gone. All of it.
Mama, l'm sorry.

01:47:22.435 --> 01:47:25.063
l seen him come home, night after night

01:47:27.674 --> 01:47:30.507
and he'd look at the rug
and he'd look at me,

01:47:30.577 --> 01:47:34.707
the red showing in his eyes,
the veins moving in his head.

01:47:35.415 --> 01:47:39.681
l seen him grow thin and old,
before he was 40,

01:47:39.753 --> 01:47:44.588
working and working and working,
like somebody's old horse, killing himself,

01:47:44.657 --> 01:47:47.956
and you give it away in one day.

01:47:48.028 --> 01:47:51.794
-Mama.
-Oh, God!

01:47:59.372 --> 01:48:01.465
Show me the strength.

01:48:05.979 --> 01:48:07.446
l'm sorry.

01:48:24.898 --> 01:48:27.765
-Are you locked out?
-No.

01:48:29.302 --> 01:48:31.065
Oh, okay.

01:48:31.137 --> 01:48:35.972
Well, l had some free time so l thought
l'd come over and help with the packing.

01:48:36.743 --> 01:48:40.179
There is something magical
about a family in preparation for a journey.

01:48:40.246 --> 01:48:44.012
The flow of life. lt makes me think of Africa.

01:48:45.819 --> 01:48:47.548
Africa.

01:48:49.722 --> 01:48:54.159
This is not a good mood.
Today is a day for sunlight.

01:48:54.360 --> 01:48:58.956
You're moving, as you have moved me.

01:49:03.670 --> 01:49:05.433
Something is wrong.

01:49:07.640 --> 01:49:12.304
-He gave away the money, Asagai.
-Who gave away what money?

01:49:12.612 --> 01:49:16.912
The insurance money.
My brother gave it away.

01:49:18.751 --> 01:49:22.278
-Gave it away?
-He would say that he made an investment.

01:49:27.560 --> 01:49:29.118
l'm very sorry.

01:49:30.296 --> 01:49:34.289
But, you know, Brother isn't the crazy one.

01:49:35.401 --> 01:49:37.596
He did what made sense to him.

01:49:37.670 --> 01:49:42.505
Mama is the crazy one for falling for it
and throwing our lives away.

01:49:44.177 --> 01:49:48.136
Perhaps you don't understand some things
as well as your mother.

01:49:50.717 --> 01:49:53.311
-And what about you now?
-Me?

01:49:55.722 --> 01:49:57.212
Nothing.

01:49:58.725 --> 01:50:01.387
But it's probably just as well, anyway.

01:50:01.461 --> 01:50:04.328
Why would anyone want to be a doctor
in this nutty world?

01:50:04.397 --> 01:50:07.389
l never thought
l would see you in such a despair.

01:50:07.467 --> 01:50:10.925
-And after such a small defeat.
-Small defeat?

01:50:12.238 --> 01:50:15.401
Asagai, this family has been wiped out.

01:50:16.276 --> 01:50:17.300
What's the matter with you?

01:50:17.377 --> 01:50:20.107
Don't they use money
where you come from?

01:50:24.350 --> 01:50:25.715
Look at me.

01:50:26.719 --> 01:50:28.482
Look at me, Alaiyo.

01:50:29.822 --> 01:50:31.517
Was it your money?

01:50:33.159 --> 01:50:35.889
-l asked if it was your money that was lost?
-lt belonged to all of us.

01:50:35.962 --> 01:50:39.489
Says who? Did you earn it?
Did anyone earn it?

01:50:39.566 --> 01:50:43.058
-My father earned it.
-Oh, yes, and he died to make it available.

01:50:43.136 --> 01:50:44.467
But what if he had not died?

01:50:44.537 --> 01:50:46.630
What then would have happened
to all the dreams,

01:50:46.706 --> 01:50:49.732
the house, the scheme, the doctor dream?

01:50:49.809 --> 01:50:51.106
There is something very wrong

01:50:51.177 --> 01:50:54.772
when all the dreams in a house
depend on a man dying.

01:50:55.215 --> 01:50:59.618
Yes, your brother made a stupid,
childish mistake,

01:50:59.686 --> 01:51:01.153
but you know what l think?

01:51:01.221 --> 01:51:03.519
-l think you are grateful to him.
-What are you talking about?

01:51:03.590 --> 01:51:06.787
l'm talking about how grateful you are,
now that you can give up on your dream.

01:51:06.859 --> 01:51:09.054
Heck, give up on the whole human race.

01:51:09.128 --> 01:51:11.596
All your big talk about,
''What good is struggle''

01:51:11.664 --> 01:51:13.427
and ''where we are all going''
and ''why are we all bothering.''

01:51:13.499 --> 01:51:16.991
-And you cannot answer it.
-l live the answer.

01:51:17.503 --> 01:51:21.940
l am the exceptional man in my village
who can even read a book.

01:51:22.008 --> 01:51:27.776
America to most of my countrymen
is an abstract, a place on a map.

01:51:27.847 --> 01:51:31.214
l live and study here.

01:51:31.284 --> 01:51:36.722
l know extraordinary things can happen
because they happen for me every day.

01:51:37.924 --> 01:51:43.920
So stop your moaning and groaning, Alaiyo,
and tell me what you plan to do.

01:51:47.433 --> 01:51:48.923
l don't know.

01:51:53.006 --> 01:51:55.566
l guess l need to think.

01:51:59.812 --> 01:52:01.370
l will help you.

01:52:02.148 --> 01:52:05.140
When all this is over, you will come with me.

01:52:06.819 --> 01:52:09.049
You're asking for a date at a time like this?

01:52:09.122 --> 01:52:15.459
Not to the movies or to dinner.
You will come with me, home, to Africa.

01:52:17.597 --> 01:52:19.064
To Nigeria?

01:52:19.465 --> 01:52:25.768
l will show you the mountains and the stars,
and give you cold drinks from the calabash,

01:52:25.838 --> 01:52:29.501
and teach you the old songs
and the ways of the Yoruba people.

01:52:29.575 --> 01:52:30.974
And, if ever you get homesick,

01:52:31.044 --> 01:52:34.605
we will pretend you have been away
for only a day.

01:52:47.527 --> 01:52:51.190
-You're getting me all mixed up.
-How? Why?

01:52:53.199 --> 01:52:58.603
Too many things.
Too much has happened today.

01:53:02.608 --> 01:53:04.508
l need to think.

01:53:06.946 --> 01:53:08.914
l will leave you to think.

01:53:18.224 --> 01:53:22.320
So often have l looked at you and said,

01:53:22.395 --> 01:53:26.126
''So this is what the New World
hath finally wrought.''

01:53:56.529 --> 01:54:01.398
There he is,
Monsieur Ie petit bourgeois noir, himself.

01:54:01.467 --> 01:54:04.436
What's our next scheme, Mr. Carnegie?
A yacht on Lake Michigan?

01:54:04.504 --> 01:54:06.563
Where you'll be installed
as chairman of some board?

01:54:06.639 --> 01:54:10.769
l look at you and see the final triumph
of stupidity in this world.

01:54:11.444 --> 01:54:13.969
-Who was that?
-Your husband.

01:54:14.313 --> 01:54:17.510
-Where'd he go?
-l think he had an appointment at US Steel.

01:54:17.583 --> 01:54:19.710
Bennie, you didn't say nothing bad to him,
now, did you?

01:54:19.786 --> 01:54:23.187
Bad? To him?
No, l told him he was a sweet boy,

01:54:23.256 --> 01:54:26.350
and full of dreams and everything
that's peachy keen.

01:54:35.134 --> 01:54:37.534
Ain't it a mess in here, though?

01:54:39.705 --> 01:54:42.299
Well, ain't no need in moping,
we need to start unpacking these crates

01:54:42.375 --> 01:54:44.673
and one of you all call the movers,
tell them not to come.

01:54:44.744 --> 01:54:45.802
Why?

01:54:45.878 --> 01:54:49.041
But it ain't no need them coming all the way
over here, got to turn around, go back.

01:54:49.115 --> 01:54:50.412
They charge for that, too.

01:54:50.483 --> 01:54:51.882
No.

01:54:52.885 --> 01:54:55.046
Lena, no. Lena.

01:54:56.456 --> 01:54:58.356
Bennie, will you tell her.

01:54:59.325 --> 01:55:02.556
Bennie, will you tell her, please,
that we can still move?

01:55:03.029 --> 01:55:06.157
Lena, now the house note ain't
but a $1 25 a month,

01:55:06.232 --> 01:55:09.599
we got four grown people in this house,
we will work.

01:55:09.936 --> 01:55:11.995
Lena l will work 20 hours a day if l have to.

01:55:12.071 --> 01:55:16.440
l will strap my baby to my back, if l have to.
But, Lena, we gotta move.

01:55:16.509 --> 01:55:19.910
-Lena, no, we gotta get out of here.
-No, Ruth, no.

01:55:19.979 --> 01:55:22.539
l'm starting to see this thing different, now.

01:55:22.615 --> 01:55:25.175
Now, l've been thinking of ways
we can fix this place up.

01:55:25.251 --> 01:55:27.879
l seen a secondhand bureau
over on Maxwell Street just the other day

01:55:27.954 --> 01:55:29.785
-that'd fit right in there.
-No. No.

01:55:29.856 --> 01:55:33.155
All it needs is some varnish
and some new handles, now.

01:55:33.226 --> 01:55:37.063
And Walter Lee can put up some screens
in your room around the baby's...

01:55:40.666 --> 01:55:43.464
-Where you been, son?
-Made a call.

01:55:43.536 --> 01:55:45.902
-To who?
-To the man.

01:55:45.972 --> 01:55:49.669
-What man, baby?
-The man, Mama.

01:55:49.742 --> 01:55:51.573
Don't you know who the man is?

01:55:51.644 --> 01:55:55.171
Beneatha, you're such a smart little girl.
Tell Mama who the man is.

01:55:55.248 --> 01:55:58.081
-Lindner.
-That's right. That's good.

01:55:58.150 --> 01:55:59.811
l told him to come right over.

01:55:59.886 --> 01:56:02.616
-For what? What you wanna see him for?
-We gonna do business with him.

01:56:02.688 --> 01:56:04.588
What you talking about, baby?

01:56:05.358 --> 01:56:07.553
l'm talking about life, Mama.

01:56:07.627 --> 01:56:10.721
You the one always telling me
to see life just the way it is?

01:56:10.796 --> 01:56:14.027
Well, l figured it out, life just the way it is.

01:56:14.100 --> 01:56:17.365
He who gets and who don't get.

01:56:17.436 --> 01:56:22.806
See, Mama, life is divided up
between the takers and the tooken.

01:56:22.875 --> 01:56:25.673
And some of us always getting tooken.

01:56:25.745 --> 01:56:28.373
People like Willy Harris
don't never get tooken.

01:56:28.447 --> 01:56:30.677
You know why the rest of us do?

01:56:30.750 --> 01:56:34.015
'Cause we all mixed up, we mixed up bad.

01:56:34.086 --> 01:56:37.715
We just always trying to find
a right and a wrong part of things in life

01:56:37.790 --> 01:56:41.282
and we just be worrying about it
and we cry about it.

01:56:41.360 --> 01:56:43.453
We stay up nights trying to figure it out.

01:56:43.529 --> 01:56:48.091
And all that time, them takers
is just out there taking and taking.

01:56:49.468 --> 01:56:51.402
Willy Harris?

01:56:51.470 --> 01:56:54.462
Willy Harris don't even count
in the big scheme of things.

01:56:54.540 --> 01:56:57.509
No. No, but l will say one thing for old Willy.

01:56:57.577 --> 01:57:01.069
He taught me to keep my eye
on what does count in this world.

01:57:01.147 --> 01:57:05.243
-What did you call that man for, Walter Lee?
-l told him to come on over to the show.

01:57:05.318 --> 01:57:08.287
We gonna put on a show for the man
exactly what he wants to see.

01:57:08.354 --> 01:57:09.787
You talking about taking
them people's money

01:57:09.855 --> 01:57:11.288
to keep us from moving into our house?

01:57:11.357 --> 01:57:12.688
No, l'm not just talking about it, baby,

01:57:12.758 --> 01:57:14.157
l'm telling you that's what's gonna happen.

01:57:14.226 --> 01:57:16.285
Oh, God, where is the bottom?

01:57:16.362 --> 01:57:19.627
Where is the honest-to-God bottom
so he can't go any farther?

01:57:22.068 --> 01:57:25.128
Where's the bottom? Where's the bottom?

01:57:26.105 --> 01:57:30.769
You and the African boy. All you
or anybody ever do is just carry a flag,

01:57:30.843 --> 01:57:33.869
or a spear,
or sing some marching songs, huh?

01:57:34.947 --> 01:57:38.883
Y'all always looking it to the right
and the wrong part of things, huh?

01:57:38.951 --> 01:57:41.010
You know what's gonna happen
to that boy one day?

01:57:41.087 --> 01:57:44.386
He's gonna find himself locked away
in a dungeon forever

01:57:44.457 --> 01:57:46.425
and the takers are gonna have the key.

01:57:46.492 --> 01:57:49.655
Forget it, baby.
There ain't no causes in this world.

01:57:49.729 --> 01:57:53.961
There ain't nothing but taking
and he who takes the most is the smartest.

01:57:54.033 --> 01:57:56.661
And it don't make
a damn bit of difference how.

01:57:56.736 --> 01:57:58.863
You making something inside me cry, son.

01:57:58.938 --> 01:58:01.168
Oh no, Mama, don't cry. Don't cry, Mama.

01:58:01.240 --> 01:58:03.731
You have to understand that
that white man's gonna come in that door,

01:58:03.809 --> 01:58:06.505
he's gonna be able to give us more money
than we ever had.

01:58:06.579 --> 01:58:09.810
More money than Willy took,
more money than Daddy left.

01:58:09.882 --> 01:58:12.544
lt's that important to him
and l'm gonna help him out.

01:58:12.618 --> 01:58:14.108
l'm gonna put on a show, Mama.

01:58:14.186 --> 01:58:18.282
Son, l come from five generations of people
who were slaves and sharecroppers,

01:58:18.357 --> 01:58:20.757
but ain't nobody in my family
never took no pay from nobody

01:58:20.826 --> 01:58:24.557
that was a way of telling us
we wasn't fit to walk the earth.

01:58:25.131 --> 01:58:30.330
We ain't never been that poor.
We ain't never been that dead inside.

01:58:31.804 --> 01:58:34.272
What's the matter with you people?

01:58:34.440 --> 01:58:37.705
l didn't make this world.
lt was given to me this way.

01:58:37.777 --> 01:58:40.371
And hell, yes, l want me some yachts!

01:58:40.446 --> 01:58:43.847
And, yes, l wanna to hang some real pearls
around my wife's neck.

01:58:43.916 --> 01:58:46.111
Ain't she supposed to wear no pearls?

01:58:46.185 --> 01:58:47.777
Somebody tell me who decides

01:58:47.853 --> 01:58:50.083
which woman gets to wear real pearls
in this world?

01:58:50.156 --> 01:58:53.387
l tell you, l'm a man
and l want my wife to wear some pearls.

01:58:53.459 --> 01:58:54.983
But how you gonna feel on the inside?

01:58:55.061 --> 01:58:57.359
l'm gonna feel fine, Mama.
l'm gonna feel like a man.

01:58:57.430 --> 01:59:01.298
-But you ain't gonna have nothing left...
-l'm gonna feel fine, Mama!

01:59:02.134 --> 01:59:04.466
l'm gonna look that man in the eyes and say,

01:59:04.537 --> 01:59:07.938
''Okay, Mr. Lindner,
that's your neighborhood out there,

01:59:08.007 --> 01:59:10.100
''you got the right
to keep it the way you want it.

01:59:10.176 --> 01:59:11.973
''You got the right
to have it how you want it.

01:59:12.044 --> 01:59:15.343
''Just write the check
and the house is yours.

01:59:15.414 --> 01:59:17.746
''Just put that money in my hands

01:59:17.817 --> 01:59:21.116
''and you ain't got to live next
to a bunch of stinking Niggers.''

01:59:21.187 --> 01:59:22.916
And, oh, Mama, for the last act...

01:59:22.988 --> 01:59:25.786
Oh, Mama, l'll just get down
on my black knees, if l have to,

01:59:25.858 --> 01:59:28.383
and get that white man what he really want.

01:59:29.261 --> 01:59:32.025
Captain, mister, bossman.

01:59:32.098 --> 01:59:36.159
Oh, Great White Father,
you just giving us that money,

01:59:36.235 --> 01:59:39.762
and we ain't gonna dirty up
your white folk neighborhood.

01:59:59.125 --> 02:00:03.357
And l'm gonna feel fine. l'm gonna feel fine.

02:00:05.297 --> 02:00:06.286
Fine.

02:00:06.532 --> 02:00:11.333
That is not a man.
That is nothing but a toothless rat.

02:00:17.042 --> 02:00:19.067
You mourning your brother?

02:00:19.145 --> 02:00:22.376
-He's no brother of mine.
-What's that you said?

02:00:22.448 --> 02:00:25.474
l said, that man in there,
is no brother of mine.

02:00:25.551 --> 02:00:31.421
-Oh, you feeling like you better than he is?
-Can't you be on my side for once?

02:00:31.857 --> 02:00:36.294
You saw what he just did, Mama.
You saw him down on his knees.

02:00:36.362 --> 02:00:39.263
Wasn't it you who taught me
to despise any man who would do that?

02:00:39.331 --> 02:00:42.129
Yeah, me and your daddy,
we taught you that.

02:00:42.201 --> 02:00:46.365
And we taught you something else.
We taught you to love him.

02:00:46.972 --> 02:00:52.433
-Love him? There's nothing left to love.
-There is always something left to love.

02:00:54.180 --> 02:00:56.705
Have you cried for that boy today?

02:00:56.782 --> 02:01:00.809
l don't mean for yourself or for the family
'cause we lost the money.

02:01:01.654 --> 02:01:05.385
l mean, for him, for what he's been through,

02:01:07.092 --> 02:01:09.219
and what it's done to him.

02:01:10.763 --> 02:01:13.391
Oh, child, when you think is the time
to love somebody the most?

02:01:13.465 --> 02:01:16.491
When they done good
and made everything easy for everybody?

02:01:16.569 --> 02:01:18.298
That's what you think?

02:01:19.438 --> 02:01:21.633
You ain't done learning.

02:01:22.975 --> 02:01:26.274
The time to love the most
is when he's at his lowest

02:01:26.345 --> 02:01:30.475
and can't believe in hisself
'cause the world done whipped him so.

02:01:32.117 --> 02:01:37.521
When you starts to measure somebody,
you measure them right.

02:01:37.590 --> 02:01:40.525
Measure him right.

02:01:44.396 --> 02:01:49.800
Make sure you done taking into account
all the hills and valleys he come through

02:01:49.869 --> 02:01:52.360
before he got to wherever he is.

02:01:56.041 --> 02:01:59.238
-The moving men are here.
-Are they, baby?

02:01:59.778 --> 02:02:03.339
Well, l better go downstairs, talk to them.

02:02:03.415 --> 02:02:07.078
l came right over.
Well, was l glad to hear from you people.

02:02:07.152 --> 02:02:09.620
Walter, he's here.

02:02:09.822 --> 02:02:16.091
Well, you know, life can really be
so much easier than people let it be, really.

02:02:17.196 --> 02:02:21.496
Okay, so with whom do l negotiate?
You, Mrs. Younger, or your son?

02:02:21.600 --> 02:02:23.693
Oh, you do this with my son.

02:02:25.037 --> 02:02:26.800
Okay.

02:02:29.141 --> 02:02:31.575
These are just some official papers.

02:02:31.644 --> 02:02:36.081
-Travis, go on outside.
-No, you don't, Travis. You come right here.

02:02:36.982 --> 02:02:40.213
Sit down, 'cause your Daddy's
getting ready to do something

02:02:40.286 --> 02:02:42.777
you gonna be needing to understand.

02:02:46.926 --> 02:02:52.592
Teach him about what's important
in this world and teach him good.

02:02:52.665 --> 02:02:54.895
Like Willy Harris taught you.

02:02:56.502 --> 02:02:59.300
Teach him about the takers and the tooken.

02:03:00.439 --> 02:03:01.906
Go on.

02:03:03.542 --> 02:03:06.841
Show your son
what five generations done come to.

02:03:19.091 --> 02:03:20.888
Well, Mr. Lindner,

02:03:23.095 --> 02:03:24.995
l called you here

02:03:27.266 --> 02:03:32.863
'cause me and my family,
we all very plain people.

02:03:32.938 --> 02:03:34.030
Yes.

02:03:36.442 --> 02:03:39.172
l've worked as a chauffeur most my life,

02:03:39.845 --> 02:03:45.283
and my wife, she does domestic work
and so does my mother.

02:03:47.152 --> 02:03:50.315
-l mean, we're very plain.
-Yes, Mr. Younger.

02:03:50.422 --> 02:03:52.652
And my father...

02:03:53.592 --> 02:03:57.050
-My father was a laborer most his life.
-Yeah, l understand. l got that. Yeah.

02:03:57.129 --> 02:03:58.960
My father almost beat a man to death once

02:03:59.031 --> 02:04:01.090
because he called him
a bad name or something.

02:04:01.166 --> 02:04:03.066
You know what l mean?

02:04:04.703 --> 02:04:06.227
l'm not so sure.

02:04:06.305 --> 02:04:12.175
What l'm trying to say is that we come
from a people who had a whole lot of pride.

02:04:13.012 --> 02:04:17.005
l mean, we are very proud people.

02:04:21.286 --> 02:04:25.655
And that's my sister over there
and she's gonna be a doctor.

02:04:26.892 --> 02:04:30.658
-And we are very proud.
-Yeah. Well, you should be. l'm sure...

02:04:30.729 --> 02:04:32.697
Hold on, let me finish.

02:04:32.765 --> 02:04:39.603
What l'm trying to say
is that we come from proud people and...

02:04:44.076 --> 02:04:48.103
That's my son, Travis. Come here, Travis.

02:04:49.381 --> 02:04:54.182
And he makes the sixth generation
of our family in this country.

02:04:56.121 --> 02:04:59.887
-We have all thought about your offer.
-Good. Good, good, good, good, good.

02:04:59.958 --> 02:05:02.085
And we have decided

02:05:06.131 --> 02:05:10.431
to move into our house, because my father...

02:05:11.336 --> 02:05:17.070
My father, he earned it for us, brick by brick.

02:05:18.510 --> 02:05:22.173
And we don't wanna start
no trouble or fight no causes.

02:05:22.414 --> 02:05:26.316
And we will do everything to, you know,
be good neighbors.

02:05:26.385 --> 02:05:29.047
And that's all we gotta say about that.

02:05:30.055 --> 02:05:32.046
We don't want your money.

02:05:34.960 --> 02:05:37.155
So you've decided to occupy?

02:05:43.135 --> 02:05:48.971
Well, then l...
l must appeal to you, Mrs. Younger.

02:05:49.041 --> 02:05:52.499
l mean, you're older, you're wiser,
you'd know the way this world works.

02:05:52.578 --> 02:05:56.070
-Talk to this boy.
-Oh, l'm afraid you don't understand.

02:05:57.349 --> 02:06:00.580
See, my son just said
we was going to move into the house.

02:06:00.652 --> 02:06:03.212
lt ain't nothing left for me to say.

02:06:04.056 --> 02:06:06.149
Well, you know
how these young people are nowadays.

02:06:06.225 --> 02:06:08.523
You can't do a thing with them.

02:06:09.661 --> 02:06:10.889
Goodbye.

02:06:15.033 --> 02:06:20.596
Well, if that's how you people feel about it,

02:06:21.406 --> 02:06:24.341
l guess there's nothing left for me to say.

02:06:29.314 --> 02:06:30.804
l...

02:06:32.017 --> 02:06:35.418
l sure hope you know
what you people are getting into.

02:06:57.776 --> 02:07:00.904
Got an order to move four rooms,
family of five. ls that you?

02:07:00.979 --> 02:07:03.311
-That's us.
-Let's get the hell out of here.

02:07:03.382 --> 02:07:04.940
Let's go. Let's go.

02:07:05.617 --> 02:07:08.586
Hey, Travis, put on your jacket.

02:07:08.654 --> 02:07:12.954
Walter Lee, fix your tie,
you look like somebody's hoodlum.

02:07:13.025 --> 02:07:14.617
Don't be laughing, Beneatha.

02:07:14.693 --> 02:07:18.060
Oh, wait, baby, that ain't no bale of cotton,
now. That's my chair.

02:07:18.130 --> 02:07:22.157
l had that chair 25 years.
l'd like sit in it again.

02:07:22.234 --> 02:07:26.227
Mama, l think l shall marry Joseph Asagai
and go live in Africa one day.

02:07:26.305 --> 02:07:29.502
-You ain't old enough to marry nobody.
-Not now, but some day.

02:07:29.575 --> 02:07:32.772
Think of all the good l can do
as a doctor in Africa.

02:07:32.844 --> 02:07:36.143
Girl, you need to forget about Africa
and all them Africans

02:07:36.215 --> 02:07:39.480
and go marry yourself a man with some loot.
Somebody like George Murchison.

02:07:39.551 --> 02:07:41.883
l wouldn't marry that narrow-minded,
little bourgeois

02:07:41.954 --> 02:07:43.444
if he was Adam and l was Eve.

02:07:43.522 --> 02:07:45.080
Adam ain't have no money either.

02:07:56.435 --> 02:07:58.130
ls something wrong?

02:08:00.739 --> 02:08:03.299
He come into his manhood, today.

02:08:04.443 --> 02:08:05.876
He sure did.

02:08:16.355 --> 02:08:19.813
Why don't you go on down, honey.
l'll be down directly.

02:08:19.992 --> 02:08:21.220
Okay.

02:08:31.536 --> 02:08:37.031
-Come on, Mama.
-Oh, all right. All right, baby, all right.

02:08:40.045 --> 02:08:41.342
All right.
