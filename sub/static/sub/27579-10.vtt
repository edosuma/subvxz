Okay. So, if Violet Crock
is out, then, um...

14:28.537 --> 14:30.106
Man, I'm stumped.

14:30.173 --> 14:32.241
You can use Harper
if you want.

14:32.307 --> 14:35.077
Violet Harper. I like it.

14:35.143 --> 14:36.279
Okay then.

14:36.346 --> 14:39.415
Violet Harper,
it's very nice to meet you.

14:39.481 --> 14:43.953
It's very nice to be met.

14:44.020 --> 14:47.920
Excuse me. Bathroom break.

14:53.729 --> 14:55.664
It's a lot warmer inside.

14:55.731 --> 14:59.435
Well, Red,
you haven't lost your touch.

14:59.501 --> 15:02.004
Or maybe I've just lost mine.

15:02.071 --> 15:05.474
You haven't lost anything
that truly matters.

15:05.541 --> 15:07.176
-Come inside, Jade.
-Will...

15:07.243 --> 15:12.243
Come inside. Stay with us.
Lian needs her mother.

15:12.815 --> 15:16.619
And I need you, too.

15:16.685 --> 15:18.554
No.

15:18.621 --> 15:19.722
You don't.

15:19.789 --> 15:21.257
Neither of you do.

15:21.324 --> 15:25.327
I couldn't cut it, rember?
The soccer mom thing.

15:25.394 --> 15:26.395
Not for me.

15:26.462 --> 15:28.430
Lian doesn't even play soccer.

15:28.497 --> 15:30.466
You know what I mean.

15:30.532 --> 15:33.235
Lian is better off without me.

15:33.302 --> 15:35.504
And you are, too.

15:35.571 --> 15:37.907
No, you're wrong.

15:37.974 --> 15:40.477
I mean, look at you, Jade.
You're here...

15:40.543 --> 15:43.146
Lurking. You wouldn't do that
if you didn't--

15:43.212 --> 15:48.212
I came to say goodbye,
in my own way, in my own mind.

15:48.584 --> 15:50.285
Face it, Red.

15:50.352 --> 15:53.255
I'm not coming back.

15:53.322 --> 15:56.772
It's time you moved on.

16:06.168 --> 16:08.418
(BOTH GRUNTING)

16:14.110 --> 16:16.812
-No Venom?
-A crutch.

16:16.879 --> 16:19.148
One I no longer require.

16:19.215 --> 16:24.215
Without it, I have found
my true strength.

-Katana.

16:48.510 --> 16:52.260
DEATHSTROKE: As you wish.

17:06.695 --> 17:08.197
I'm the better swordswoman.

17:08.264 --> 17:12.468
But I'll admit your Soultaker
is the superior blade.

17:12.534 --> 17:14.934
It will be mine.

17:29.819 --> 17:32.669
(METAMORPHO GROANS)

17:35.158 --> 17:38.060
Bulletproof. That's annoying.

17:38.127 --> 17:40.362
Tip of the iceberg, Strokey.

17:40.429 --> 17:41.629
Show me.

17:47.569 --> 17:50.269
(METAMORPHO YELLS)

17:52.741 --> 17:54.910
DEATHSTROKE:
Hurts, doesn't it?

17:54.977 --> 17:59.415
Sure. Sure it hurts.
But you want to know a secret?

17:59.482 --> 18:04.482
I'm in near-constant pain,
I've just learned to adapt.

18:06.789 --> 18:09.525

Thanks, man.

Let's hear it
for our savior! To Vic.

Booyah!

Hey, team effort.

Mmm! Exceptional.

Oh, yeah, I know.
I know you gotta say that.

And I love
that you know to say it.

20:29.532 --> 20:32.736
I gotta tell you, Vic,
we like what we see.

20:32.802 --> 20:36.072
You're the whole package.
Big, fast, strong, great hands

20:36.138 --> 20:37.540

-You try? (LAUGHS)
I love this kid.

You keep this up
and I guarantee

you'll score a four-year
free ride to the college
of your choice.

Now I'm gonna go out
on a limb here and say
that choice should be Met U.
