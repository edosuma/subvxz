01:12.320 --> 01:14.360
Hey, wait!

01:14.880 --> 01:15.960
What are you doing?

01:17.840 --> 01:19.440
You're not gonna jump, are you?

01:22.480 --> 01:25.280
My name is Jack. What's yours?

01:27.560 --> 01:31.680
My dad, Jim, is a policeman. He's good
to talk to if you've got problems.

01:31.760 --> 01:34.680
You can speak to him. I've got his number.

01:40.160 --> 01:42.320
Would you please
drop this off at the bank?

01:46.040 --> 01:47.840
If you promise not to jump.

01:59.120 --> 02:00.200
No!

02:25.080 --> 02:26.640
-Hello.
-Good morning, Dad.

02:26.720 --> 02:30.120
-Did you have a good run?
-Yes, it was refreshing.

02:30.840 --> 02:32.520
-That's nice.
-Yeah.

02:32.600 --> 02:33.720
Join me next time.

02:33.800 --> 02:35.600
My knee won't let me.

02:35.680 --> 02:37.160
-Your knee?
-Yes.

02:38.240 --> 02:42.560
You can't keep blaming
your knee, Dad. It's--

02:42.640 --> 02:44.920
Why not? It's worked all these years.

02:45.760 --> 02:49.760
What if you need to chase someone?
There could be a murder.

02:49.840 --> 02:52.680
Someone murders someone else
and runs off. What do you do?

02:52.760 --> 02:55.560
-You wouldn't chase them?
-No, I've got you.

02:55.640 --> 03:00.400
I'll call for backup from the car,
then you'll go and chase the murderer.

03:00.480 --> 03:02.960
I'll just sit there shouting.

03:03.040 --> 03:04.920
Or you could learn to run.

03:05.000 --> 03:07.120
What are you up to tomorrow?

03:07.200 --> 03:09.280
Well, I guess

03:09.760 --> 03:11.880
I'll hang around here with you.

03:11.960 --> 03:13.240
That's nice.

03:16.360 --> 03:19.320
I sincerely hope not.

03:20.960 --> 03:23.280
I'm thinking about my sis.

03:25.280 --> 03:26.760
As far as I remember,

03:27.600 --> 03:31.080
you spent the whole evening sulking
that Jill didn't come.

03:35.480 --> 03:39.680
We need something nice to eat tomorrow.
It's New Year's Eve.

03:42.120 --> 03:43.160
Sure.

03:44.200 --> 03:47.200
-Let's go shopping after work.
-Sounds good.

03:47.280 --> 03:48.840
-Yeah, great.
-Sure.

03:49.640 --> 03:50.680
Super.

03:52.640 --> 03:55.480
-That smells nice. I'll have a shower.
-Okay.

04:05.840 --> 04:11.320
OPEN HOUSE

04:35.640 --> 04:38.880
No. Fuck.

04:38.960 --> 04:43.280
-Don't worry about them.
-Can't you see she's pregnant?

04:43.360 --> 04:46.800
Pregnant women are irrational.
She'll ruin everything.

04:46.880 --> 04:50.520
As long as we stick to the plan,
all will be fine.

04:51.800 --> 04:53.480
Nobody does this better than you.

04:54.840 --> 04:56.000
Hey.

04:57.920 --> 04:59.160
Sure.

04:59.240 --> 05:01.360
Don't fret. We're here.

05:01.440 --> 05:04.960
This could be our last chance.

05:09.280 --> 05:10.240
Hello.

05:12.240 --> 05:13.720
Are you alone?

05:14.800 --> 05:16.320
Yes, that's right.

05:17.200 --> 05:20.120
It's a large apartment for one person.

05:21.120 --> 05:22.360
God.

05:22.440 --> 05:23.880
-Hello.
-Hi.

05:34.320 --> 05:36.560
Oh, isn't it very…

05:37.040 --> 05:39.040
It's very short at the back.

05:39.640 --> 05:42.520
-Right here at the bottom.
-Please, Jack.

05:42.600 --> 05:45.000
If you have your hair cut
once every six months,

05:45.080 --> 05:48.680
you can't expect me
to just do a bit of a trim.

05:48.760 --> 05:50.840
Your hair would be hanging
down to your ass.

05:50.920 --> 05:52.920
Look at your dad. He looks great.

05:53.000 --> 05:56.120
Sure, I'm just not used to it.

05:57.760 --> 06:00.680
It's nice that Jill is coming

06:00.760 --> 06:02.880
so you can celebrate
New Year's Eve together.

06:05.000 --> 06:06.240
Hang on. Jill?

06:07.280 --> 06:09.280
My sister's coming here?

06:09.360 --> 06:13.120
Yeah, shit, sorry. Your dad told me.

06:13.200 --> 06:16.920
What did he say? Has he bought
a ticket for her or sent her the money?

06:17.000 --> 06:19.920
I don't know,
but don't get angry with him.

06:20.000 --> 06:22.240
He just wants you to get together.

06:23.200 --> 06:26.240
If she comes here first, I can pamper her.

06:30.080 --> 06:33.800
I'll transfer the money right away.
I'll see you around four.

06:38.440 --> 06:40.760
-Nice. Different.
-Dad.

06:41.440 --> 06:43.240
Did you send Jill money again?

06:44.360 --> 06:46.920
Yes, she's coming this afternoon.

06:47.000 --> 06:51.120
She's catching the train from Stockholm.
She wants to celebrate with us. Lovely!

06:53.160 --> 06:58.160
You do realize that
she won't be coming this time either.

06:58.240 --> 07:00.240
You do know that, right?

07:00.920 --> 07:04.840
I thought we'd have meringue
with cream and chocolate for dessert.

07:04.920 --> 07:05.840
So,

07:07.160 --> 07:10.680
the money will be used to buy drugs.
It's the same every time.

07:10.760 --> 07:12.920
-It's happened a thousand times.
-No.

07:13.000 --> 07:18.000
She sounded very happy and alert.
She's coming. Enough said, okay?

07:18.080 --> 07:20.480
-Just listen to me, Dad.
-Not one more word.

07:20.560 --> 07:23.600
Don't you understand that
you're paying for her drug habit

07:23.680 --> 07:25.640
by sending her money all the time?

07:25.720 --> 07:29.840
How can you be so negative
about your own sister?

07:36.920 --> 07:38.640
Please take a ticket.

07:40.200 --> 07:41.600
Sorry, could you--

07:48.000 --> 07:50.720
I… I have no money.

07:51.320 --> 07:52.920
There's no money here.

07:54.600 --> 07:55.440
CASHLESS BANK

07:55.520 --> 07:57.320
We're a cashless bank.

07:57.400 --> 07:59.600
No money, no dinero.

07:59.680 --> 08:02.960
-She's your own flesh and blood.
-I miss the real Jill.

08:03.040 --> 08:05.320
Nyet money!

08:08.160 --> 08:11.560
I don't have any money.
Please, I don't wanna die.

08:11.640 --> 08:14.160
Last time she left after two days.

08:14.240 --> 08:18.920
-Oh my God! There's a robber--
-You've agreed for her to go to rehab.

08:19.000 --> 08:21.360
I don't have any money, I swear!

08:22.360 --> 08:24.000
-Help!
-There's a robbery!

08:24.080 --> 08:28.280
-Jack, Jim, there's a robbery!
-Sorry, I'll pay you.

08:28.360 --> 08:30.000
-No, behind you.
-What?

08:30.080 --> 08:31.920
There's a robber in the bank.

08:32.000 --> 08:33.640
There! Run!

08:34.760 --> 08:38.360
-Wait, the robber may be armed.
-Police! Stop!

08:39.360 --> 08:44.280
Help! I've been robbed.
He pointed the gun at my head.

08:44.360 --> 08:46.840
He's armed! Jack, wait!

08:46.920 --> 08:50.720
-Take it easy.
-Get a damn weapon over here.

08:55.200 --> 08:57.040
Stop! Police!

09:03.320 --> 09:05.440
He's in there. What do we do?

09:05.520 --> 09:08.640
Watch the door. I've radioed for backup.

09:15.440 --> 09:16.480
-I'll check the back.
-Yes.

09:18.440 --> 09:19.720
Jack.

09:21.720 --> 09:24.400
-Good. Step away from the door.
-Sure.

09:24.480 --> 09:28.240
You look like an idiot.
Can I do the other side?

09:28.320 --> 09:31.400
-Not now. Stand back, please.
-Stand back?

09:34.880 --> 09:36.400
We can't get in, right?

09:38.080 --> 09:39.880
-Fuck.
-You heard him. Stand back.

09:39.960 --> 09:42.680
-What do we do?
-Cecilia, will you come over here?

09:42.760 --> 09:44.760
The steps by Stortorget.

09:51.280 --> 09:54.120
Doesn't it smell a bit musty, Roger?

09:54.200 --> 09:56.400
-You think so?
-You might be right.

09:56.480 --> 09:59.600
Did you hear, Julia?
There's mold in the apartment.

09:59.680 --> 10:02.640
We need to talk to the agent.
That should be in the ad.

10:05.280 --> 10:06.200
OPEN HOUSE

10:07.000 --> 10:09.800
How can they be asking four million
for this apartment?

10:10.320 --> 10:12.040
It's extortionate, if you ask me.

10:14.280 --> 10:17.400
-What's that noise?
-Luckily the kids have left home.

10:18.160 --> 10:19.800
That's what I call a quick tour.

10:20.320 --> 10:23.280
It's harmful for little kids.

10:23.360 --> 10:26.000
And grown-ups.

10:27.240 --> 10:31.240
-No!
-It's a robbery! We're being robbed!

10:31.320 --> 10:32.720
No!

10:32.800 --> 10:35.440
What the hell was that? What the…

10:35.960 --> 10:37.200
Where is it coming from?

10:42.640 --> 10:44.760
-Don't shoot!
-Take it easy.

10:44.840 --> 10:49.000
-Don't shoot. Have you got cash?
-Do I look like a drug dealer?

10:49.080 --> 10:52.080
Everybody down on the floor. Get down!

10:52.160 --> 10:54.400
My pregnant wife
can't lie on a wooden floor.

10:54.480 --> 10:56.640
-Do as you're told.
-He's not said a thing.

10:56.720 --> 10:59.480
That's what you do. Get down!

11:00.040 --> 11:02.480
Worst case scenario,
we have a hostage situation.

11:02.560 --> 11:04.400
What the hell do we do?

11:04.480 --> 11:07.280
We'll have to check who lives here
and evacuate the building.

11:07.360 --> 11:09.480
-Jim, what's going on?
-Hi, Cecilia.

11:09.560 --> 11:12.000
We have a possible hostage situation.

11:12.080 --> 11:16.320
Call the real estate agent and find out
how many people are at the viewing.

11:16.400 --> 11:18.480
-And get people to stand back.
-Sure.

11:18.560 --> 11:22.640
Jack, you're in charge of monitoring
and securing the area. Start down there.

11:22.720 --> 11:24.160
Jonsson, come with me.

11:24.680 --> 11:26.800
What's going on?

11:26.880 --> 11:29.720
We have nothing to say right now.
Please stand back.

11:29.800 --> 11:33.360
-Well, something's up.
-I can't discuss this right now.

11:33.440 --> 11:36.320
-Just a brief comment?
-I said no. Okay?

11:36.840 --> 11:38.840
-I know something.
-Tell me.

11:38.920 --> 11:42.520
There was a bank robber.
He was in the bank.

11:42.600 --> 11:46.080
-Has there been a bank robbery?
-Yes, write. He had a gun.

11:46.160 --> 11:49.720
-Then he ran from the bank.
-Please, stand back.

11:49.800 --> 11:53.240
-Come over here, please.
-I saw Jack and Jim outside.

11:53.320 --> 11:56.040
I shouted at them
to turn around and they did.

11:56.120 --> 11:58.480
They just stood there and did nothing?

11:58.560 --> 12:01.880
They missed the whole thing,
but when I shouted, they turned around.

12:01.960 --> 12:05.600
We can't get in.
We need the code. Järngatan 1.

12:05.680 --> 12:08.840
-Okay?
-We've got surveillance at the back.

12:08.920 --> 12:10.400
-You spoke to the agent?
-No.

12:10.480 --> 12:12.440
I'm waiting for the code
we need to get in.

12:18.080 --> 12:21.240
-Ro.
-We'll be fine.

12:27.080 --> 12:29.000
-Stop that.
-Shush.

12:29.080 --> 12:29.920
I said, stop it.

12:32.680 --> 12:36.760
Take it easy. Everyone put
their cell phones on the floor.

12:36.840 --> 12:38.400
Just put them on the floor.

12:40.960 --> 12:43.200
All cell phones out.

12:44.400 --> 12:45.440
We don't want any heroes.

12:47.960 --> 12:50.160
No one try to be a hero.

13:10.720 --> 13:13.600
-Stop.
-What?

13:14.120 --> 13:17.160
-The bomb. There.
-Why would that be a bomb?

13:20.920 --> 13:22.680
I think it's a bomb.

13:22.760 --> 13:24.440
Why would it be?

13:24.520 --> 13:27.400
It looks like a bomb. See for yourself.

13:27.480 --> 13:29.560
We'll have to call the bomb squad.

13:29.640 --> 13:31.040
No. Just ignore it.

13:31.120 --> 13:33.080
You're not going anywhere.

13:33.760 --> 13:36.600
It could be a bomb
placed there by the robber. Come on.

13:37.920 --> 13:40.000
Haven't we made
big enough fools of ourselves?

13:40.080 --> 13:41.240
Move.

13:47.800 --> 13:50.800
We'll have to just wait.
There's not much else we can do.

13:50.880 --> 13:55.560
The hostage taker has barricaded himself
in there and there's a bomb by the stairs.

13:55.640 --> 13:56.680
We can't go in.

13:57.320 --> 14:01.360
-No, he's made no demands, but--
-Here. Tea.

14:01.440 --> 14:05.920
Thanks. How long is it going to be?
An hour or more?

14:06.000 --> 14:07.920
-Who are you talking to?
-Sorry?

14:08.000 --> 14:10.120
-Who are you talking to?
-Hang on.

14:10.760 --> 14:14.600
The Stockholm police.
They'll be here in two hours. I had to--

14:14.680 --> 14:17.280
Jim Johansson here.
I've been a policeman for 30 years.

14:17.360 --> 14:21.600
<i>Hi. Bosse speaking. We'll be along</i>
<i>with the SWAT team, so take it easy.</i>

14:21.680 --> 14:25.480
We're taking it very easy.
Everything is under control.

14:27.040 --> 14:28.280
Oh fuck!

14:28.360 --> 14:32.040
-Are you okay?
-Stand back!

14:32.120 --> 14:34.640
Stand back. You're not safe here.

14:35.440 --> 14:37.240
-Stand back.
-Extend the cordon.

14:37.320 --> 14:38.760
Back away, dammit.

14:39.320 --> 14:41.080
-Stand back.
-Fucking hell.

14:43.640 --> 14:45.880
Hello. Hello?

14:45.960 --> 14:48.080
-Push the button on the side.
-Yes.

14:48.920 --> 14:52.880
Hello, this is Jim Johansson.
Is everybody unharmed?

14:55.880 --> 14:59.920
Why did you call in the Stockholm police?
Everything is under control.

15:00.000 --> 15:02.920
We need to have someone here
who knows what they're doing.

15:03.000 --> 15:06.320
-We know nothing about this.
-I have experience, okay?

15:08.880 --> 15:15.280
Hello. Jim Johansson again.
Please confirm that everybody is unharmed.

15:15.360 --> 15:17.040
Could you give us a sign

15:17.120 --> 15:19.000
if that is truly the case?

15:25.200 --> 15:26.240
Okay, great.

15:27.160 --> 15:28.240
What do we do now?

15:30.600 --> 15:31.600
We wait.

15:33.600 --> 15:36.200
Hostage takers tend
to state demands sooner or later.

16:01.000 --> 16:02.960
It's quarter past.

16:03.040 --> 16:04.560
Let's wait a little longer.

16:10.560 --> 16:11.720
I'm thinking about Jill.

16:14.200 --> 16:16.360
She should have been here ages ago.

16:25.280 --> 16:27.000
Shit. Dad, I'm sorry

16:27.680 --> 16:28.880
for shouting at you.

16:28.960 --> 16:31.600
You just need to accept
that she's not coming.

16:32.120 --> 16:34.280
That's the way it is. It's better to just

16:35.240 --> 16:37.240
accept it.

16:39.960 --> 16:42.080
I'm just finding it so hard.

16:45.720 --> 16:48.120
I can't understand why she would lie.

16:51.040 --> 16:52.680
No, but

16:54.040 --> 16:56.680
she's not her usual self.

16:57.280 --> 17:01.480
You need to remember that.
She needs to want to get out of this.

17:01.560 --> 17:05.800
-Otherwise she won't--
-I just want to help her.

17:06.440 --> 17:09.520
-I…
-I get that, Dad. I totally understand.

17:13.480 --> 17:15.400
You want to help, but you can't.

17:22.320 --> 17:23.480
I hate this.

17:23.560 --> 17:27.080
Just sitting here and waiting,
and we can't do shit.

17:27.600 --> 17:31.440
That's why it's important to be able
to handle stress and be patient.

17:31.520 --> 17:33.680
Yes, but…

17:34.320 --> 17:37.800
He might start shooting up there.
Anything could happen.

17:37.880 --> 17:39.960
-We need to--
-Just take it easy.

17:40.560 --> 17:42.920
And call off the Stockholm police.

17:43.000 --> 17:44.520
We can manage this on our own.

17:45.880 --> 17:47.480
You and me, Jack. We can do this.

17:48.560 --> 17:49.480
Right?

17:57.760 --> 18:00.480
There is an armed hostage taker.

18:00.560 --> 18:05.960
It is unknown how many people
are in the apartment.

18:06.040 --> 18:09.280
More than an hour has passed
and it's not been possible to…

18:09.360 --> 18:11.760
Jim, any developments? What's happening?

18:11.840 --> 18:13.760
I went for a pee, that's all.

18:14.800 --> 18:16.480
So what's the time?

18:17.000 --> 18:17.880
Quarter past.

18:21.720 --> 18:24.160
Someone's coming out.

18:24.240 --> 18:26.000
The robber wants to make contact.

18:26.560 --> 18:27.960
-Just keep calm.
-Sure.

18:28.040 --> 18:29.680
Goddammit.

18:31.200 --> 18:32.800
What do we do?

18:33.560 --> 18:35.760
Hello? Jim Johansson here--

18:36.280 --> 18:38.960
-The battery is dead.
-Fucking hell!

18:39.040 --> 18:42.400
Jim Johansson. Please confirm
that everybody is fine.

18:42.480 --> 18:43.360
Yes.

18:46.360 --> 18:48.360
-Ow, shit.
-What happened?

18:48.440 --> 18:50.080
Something hit me in the face.

18:50.600 --> 18:53.480
What the hell? Ouch!

18:54.360 --> 18:55.640
What the hell was that?

19:01.440 --> 19:03.920
Is it a lime?
What the hell are they doing?

19:06.760 --> 19:07.760
He wants pizza.

19:09.560 --> 19:10.880
What? Pizza?

19:11.720 --> 19:12.680
It's his demand.

19:14.760 --> 19:18.400
-Do we agree to it?
-Of course. Then we establish contact.

19:18.480 --> 19:20.280
I'll go order. You deal with this.

19:22.000 --> 19:24.920
-What's going on?
-Someone threw a lime at me.

19:25.000 --> 19:27.080
-He's ordering pizza for them.
-Okay.

19:27.160 --> 19:31.360
I'll try to get up there
to get a better view of the apartment.

19:33.680 --> 19:35.120
-Please stand back.
-Jack!

19:35.200 --> 19:38.000
I can't talk now. No comment.

19:41.480 --> 19:45.680
-Four <i>capricciosas</i>!
-I'm gonna have to-- I apologize.

19:45.760 --> 19:48.480
-It's not your--
-No, I know.

19:51.720 --> 19:54.360
One kebab pizza. Please, be quiet.

19:54.440 --> 19:57.320
One jungle pizza. No ham, but add peanuts.

19:57.400 --> 19:58.440
One <i>al tonno</i>, no onion.

19:58.520 --> 20:00.400
Two pizza <i>ai funghi</i>. Can you do that?

20:00.480 --> 20:01.800
We don't have a kebab pizza.

20:01.880 --> 20:05.360
Just use ham and fry it a bit extra.

20:06.720 --> 20:07.600
Oh fuck.

20:16.400 --> 20:18.440
Just throw them in the oven.

20:19.760 --> 20:24.360
Can we just remove the shrimps?
They're unnecessary. Check the note.

20:24.440 --> 20:25.680
No shrimps, right?

20:25.760 --> 20:26.760
Excuse me.

20:26.840 --> 20:28.600
Can I just take one of these?

20:28.680 --> 20:30.000
No, you can't!

20:30.080 --> 20:33.120
I need eight pizzas, pronto!

20:34.840 --> 20:35.680
Hi.

20:36.840 --> 20:38.560
Is your mom or dad home?

20:39.160 --> 20:40.440
No.

20:41.560 --> 20:45.360
Can I come in for a moment?

20:45.440 --> 20:47.640
-I need to look out of the window--
-No.

20:49.080 --> 20:51.600
It's really important. I'm a policeman.

20:52.960 --> 20:54.840
What if you're a dirty old man?

20:55.480 --> 20:58.840
<i>The pizzas have arrived.</i>
<i>Jim is coming up with them. Over.</i>

20:59.960 --> 21:01.200
-Move.
-Jack, what's going on?

21:01.280 --> 21:02.520
I can't speak right now.

21:03.280 --> 21:04.280
Excuse me.

21:05.560 --> 21:07.960
-Why did you let him go upstairs?
-He's the boss.

21:08.040 --> 21:10.560
But there's a bomb up there.

21:10.640 --> 21:11.760
You old fart.

21:16.600 --> 21:17.480
Dad!

21:19.200 --> 21:20.040
Dad?

21:26.720 --> 21:29.280
What the hell are you doing?
You weren't meant to go up.

21:31.120 --> 21:32.080
Right?

21:33.200 --> 21:34.680
I spoke to the robber.

21:35.440 --> 21:37.720
What did he say? What did he look like?

21:37.800 --> 21:41.400
He was wearing a balaclava.
I just delivered the pizzas.

21:41.480 --> 21:44.000
Can I have some intel? Was anyone hurt?

21:44.080 --> 21:45.560
No, no one was hurt.

21:46.520 --> 21:49.160
No. Will he release the hostages?

21:49.240 --> 21:50.280
One more demand.

21:50.360 --> 21:53.960
He wants fireworks to be set off.
Then the hostages will be released.

21:55.560 --> 22:00.400
Hang on.
First pizza and now fireworks. Why?

22:00.480 --> 22:01.760
What's going on?

22:01.840 --> 22:03.240
I don't know.

22:04.880 --> 22:06.760
But why did you go up there?

22:06.840 --> 22:09.040
That was quite a risk with that bomb.

22:09.120 --> 22:11.240
Lucky we didn't call the bomb squad.

22:12.240 --> 22:14.920
It wasn't a bomb. It was Christmas lights.

22:16.600 --> 22:20.600
And call off the Stockholm police.

22:20.680 --> 22:24.800
If we do what the robber wants,
this will be just fine.

22:24.880 --> 22:28.160
I need to go get fireworks.

22:28.880 --> 22:30.040
Okay, but--

22:35.560 --> 22:37.560
-That's perfect.
-Yes.

22:38.200 --> 22:40.320
Do these have enough juice in them?

22:40.400 --> 22:42.000
I should hope so.

22:42.640 --> 22:44.000
-Awesome.
-Yes.

22:44.080 --> 22:45.640
Hey, Jack?

22:46.160 --> 22:47.800
The Stockholm police are coming,

22:47.880 --> 22:51.080
and you look like
a self-harming guinea pig.

22:51.160 --> 22:55.160
-Seriously. Can't I just finish it?
-Not right now.

22:55.240 --> 22:56.880
I'll be quick, I promise.

22:56.960 --> 22:59.880
-Just sit down and let me have a look.
-Okay.

23:00.800 --> 23:03.200
-Okay, just make it quick.
-It's not really ugly…

23:03.280 --> 23:04.480
Do you have a lighter?

23:05.280 --> 23:06.960
-Will you light the fuse?
-Sure.

23:20.600 --> 23:24.680
They're coming out, Dad.
Come on, they're coming!

23:24.760 --> 23:27.400
Not now. Hang on.

23:31.080 --> 23:34.080
-How many are there?
-I don't know.

23:34.160 --> 23:36.280
Six, I think, or is someone behind them?

23:42.200 --> 23:45.280
Hang on. Just a moment.

23:50.480 --> 23:53.640
There are six of them, right?
Is the perp there as well?

23:53.720 --> 23:54.880
No.

23:57.720 --> 23:59.720
Move out of the way.

24:07.640 --> 24:09.200
Didn't you call off Stockholm?

24:09.720 --> 24:14.400
No, 'cause there's a robber up there,
and we can't deal with this on our own.

24:15.400 --> 24:16.360
What's the status?

24:18.360 --> 24:22.520
I think you came in vain
because the hostages are being released.

24:22.600 --> 24:25.000
-Really?
-Here they are. Look.

24:26.080 --> 24:28.400
-The hostages are being released.
-Take care of them.

24:28.480 --> 24:29.520
I need help.

24:30.960 --> 24:33.120
They brought in the big guns.

24:43.720 --> 24:46.760
-It was the second floor, right?
-Yes.

24:46.840 --> 24:50.000
-On the north side.
-Yes, up on the left, second floor.

24:50.080 --> 24:54.080
Guys, we're going in.
The unsub is believed to be armed.

24:54.160 --> 24:58.200
-So many of them.
-Beware. Second floor. 14-02.

24:59.680 --> 25:02.160
-Okay.
-What are you doing?

25:02.240 --> 25:07.440
I left my head in the apartment.
I need my head back.

25:07.520 --> 25:11.120
-We're going to the police station.
-What if I don't have time?

25:11.200 --> 25:14.840
Jim, I can see movement in the apartment.
It could be the hostage taker.

25:14.920 --> 25:17.600
<i>The hostage taker</i>
<i>may still be in the apartment.</i>

25:18.240 --> 25:19.560
Roger that.

25:48.080 --> 25:52.560
-Police!
-Police!

25:58.920 --> 26:01.400
-Clear on the left.
-Clear on the left.

26:01.480 --> 26:03.560
-Clear on the right.
-Clear on the right.

26:04.640 --> 26:06.760
All secured. It's empty.

26:06.840 --> 26:08.480
Empty? It can't be.

26:08.560 --> 26:11.400
-If it's empty, it's empty.
-They can't have looked properly.

26:11.480 --> 26:13.280
There was a back door too.

26:15.360 --> 26:17.560
-You shouldn't have called them.
-Empty?

26:24.200 --> 26:27.200
Cecilia, are you sure
you saw someone in the window?

26:27.280 --> 26:28.520
<i>I mean,</i>

26:29.040 --> 26:31.640
<i>I can't be certain that it was a person</i>,

26:31.720 --> 26:33.920
<i>but I thought</i>
<i>I saw something moving about.</i>

26:34.000 --> 26:37.200
<i>Yes, something was moving,</i>
<i>but not a person.</i>

26:37.280 --> 26:38.880
<i>I can't say I saw anyone.</i>

26:39.400 --> 26:42.200
Does Cecilia have astigmatism?

26:42.880 --> 26:45.280
Does she have cataracts, myopia?

26:45.360 --> 26:47.200
I don't know.

26:47.280 --> 26:48.600
Maybe it was the wind.

26:51.080 --> 26:54.280
There's a door to a stairwell over there.
Did you monitor that?

26:54.360 --> 26:58.440
There is a back door,
which we have been monitoring.

26:58.520 --> 27:00.080
Are you responsible for that?

27:00.160 --> 27:02.120
Yes, that's correct. I am.

27:02.200 --> 27:04.200
I'm in charge here.

27:05.440 --> 27:07.320
You two can hold a meeting tomorrow

27:07.400 --> 27:09.600
to decide who's the best
at being the worst.

27:11.520 --> 27:12.720
Excuse me.

27:16.880 --> 27:19.960
Before I go, hats off to your hairstyle.

27:20.040 --> 27:23.200
It's truly remarkable. You look amazing.

27:23.280 --> 27:27.920
It cuts right across your face
and lands in a baby face

27:28.000 --> 27:30.760
with a patchy mustache
in a style I've never seen before.

27:31.400 --> 27:32.320
Who cut it?

27:32.960 --> 27:34.440
-Milou.
-Milou?

27:35.040 --> 27:36.280
Skilled scissor work.

27:37.240 --> 27:38.520
Five stars.

27:40.040 --> 27:41.080
Bye.

27:44.880 --> 27:46.720
Don't let it get to you.

27:50.360 --> 27:52.480
<i>I'm taking the hostages</i>
<i>to the police station.</i>

27:53.000 --> 27:55.520
Don't let anyone go.
We need to interview all of them.

27:55.600 --> 27:58.600
We need to cordon off the apartment.

27:58.680 --> 27:59.920
There's blood on the floor,

28:00.000 --> 28:03.280
and there's a gun
that needs to be processed.

28:03.360 --> 28:04.440
Can you deal with that?

28:04.520 --> 28:07.480
<i>-Sure, no problem.</i>
-Great, we'll be right there.

28:07.560 --> 28:09.800
Tell Milou to bring the scissors.

28:10.720 --> 28:11.560
<i>Of course.</i>

28:21.000 --> 28:27.320
Okay, I'll take Anna-Lena,
Ro, Estelle, and Roger.

28:27.400 --> 28:33.480
Right? You take Sara, Julia,
Maria, and Lennart, the pajama guy.

28:33.560 --> 28:37.880
Who's the pajama guy?
The guy in the bunny costume?

28:37.960 --> 28:39.640
Do you wanna interview him?

28:39.720 --> 28:41.800
-Yes, I'll interview the bunny.
-Let's do it.

28:42.320 --> 28:44.600
-Can you send in Ro, please?
-Sure.

28:45.120 --> 28:48.480
I've been robbed before.
You just do what you're told.

28:49.080 --> 28:52.240
Don't make eye contact,
as it may be perceived as provocative.

28:52.320 --> 28:55.440
Yes. You must have seen something?

28:55.520 --> 28:57.280
No, I was looking at the floor.

28:58.800 --> 29:01.680
Tell me about the hostage situation.
What do you remember?

29:01.760 --> 29:06.160
We had to lie on the floor,
and I was facing the wall.

29:06.760 --> 29:07.600
You poor thing.

29:08.800 --> 29:11.520
Are you able to describe
the hostage taker?

29:11.600 --> 29:14.280
I didn't look up at all, I said.

29:14.360 --> 29:16.800
Is there anything you remember
that you can tell me?

29:16.880 --> 29:19.800
Our car is parked outside. I haven't paid.

29:19.880 --> 29:20.760
Paid?

29:20.840 --> 29:22.520
Will the government pay

29:22.600 --> 29:25.960
the parking fine in the event
of a hostage situation? Please?

29:26.040 --> 29:29.960
-What did he look like?
-I can't remember a thing.

29:30.040 --> 29:33.600
-Was he tall or short?
-I don't remember even being there.

29:34.360 --> 29:38.000
I think he had a big beard
under the balaclava.

29:38.080 --> 29:41.160
No one has mentioned that before.
Are you sure?

29:41.240 --> 29:45.360
I may be confusing him
with the guy in the mini market.

29:45.440 --> 29:47.120
He also wears black.

29:47.200 --> 29:49.280
I suppose you didn't see
the robber either?

29:49.360 --> 29:50.200
No.

29:50.720 --> 29:52.640
Thank you. That's enough for today.

29:52.720 --> 29:56.960
-Please describe his body shape.
-He had a beer belly and a boozer's ass.

29:58.840 --> 30:02.440
Why are you wearing that costume?

30:02.520 --> 30:04.360
Why are you in your uniform?

30:04.440 --> 30:05.600
Because I'm a policeman.

30:05.680 --> 30:07.000
And I'm a bunny.

30:07.680 --> 30:11.840
Do you know where the perp was when
you were allowed to leave the apartment?

30:11.920 --> 30:16.160
I am certain
that he was probably still there.

30:18.040 --> 30:18.880
Okay.

30:18.960 --> 30:20.880
Jack, let's call it a day.

30:20.960 --> 30:23.840
-Sure, let's.
-That's all I had to say.

30:29.240 --> 30:30.240
Bye.

30:35.160 --> 30:36.680
I can't wait to get home.

30:38.360 --> 30:39.560
I've had enough of this.

30:44.040 --> 30:46.920
-You must be tired and want to go home.
-We're okay.

30:47.000 --> 30:51.160
It's been a long
and traumatic day for all of us.

30:51.240 --> 30:54.400
You will be able to leave soon.
We just need to see you briefly

30:54.480 --> 30:56.200
out in the reception area.

30:56.280 --> 30:57.440
Come with me.

31:20.400 --> 31:21.360
Right.

31:21.880 --> 31:23.880
-So…
-Alright.

31:23.960 --> 31:28.760
Sometimes it's easier to remember things
after a few days have passed.

31:28.840 --> 31:33.200
I want you to have a good think
over the New Year.

31:33.280 --> 31:37.120
Someone must have seen more
than what's emerged here tonight.

31:37.200 --> 31:39.880
Of course, everyone tried their best.

31:39.960 --> 31:41.960
Thank you for your time.

31:42.040 --> 31:43.720
-May we leave now?
-Sure.

31:44.360 --> 31:45.400
Thank you.

31:46.280 --> 31:48.880
We'll be in touch
and will speak with you again.

31:51.000 --> 31:52.160
Thank you.

31:53.160 --> 31:55.720
-Happy New Year.
-And to you.

31:58.160 --> 31:59.720
Jesus Christ.

32:01.000 --> 32:03.240
How about
taking it a little easier sometimes?

32:03.920 --> 32:06.360
-What do you mean?
-These are human beings.

32:06.440 --> 32:08.240
Do I need to take it easy?

32:08.320 --> 32:09.400
-Yes.
-But…

32:09.480 --> 32:14.080
I'm gonna get to the bottom of this,
regardless of how tricky this is for them.

32:16.760 --> 32:19.960
I'm gonna get this damn robber,
I'm telling you.
