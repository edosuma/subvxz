what I had to do was a lot ¶

18:11.424 --> 18:14.759
¶ I still gave it a shot,
and sometimes I had to shoot ¶

18:14.761 --> 18:16.294
¶ catching vics... ¶
oh, my God.

18:16.296 --> 18:18.096
Is that dmx?

18:18.098 --> 18:20.364
I've been arranging
"ghetto life" for the piccolo.

18:20.366 --> 18:22.900
I actually wrote "ghetto life"
on the piccolo.

18:22.902 --> 18:24.402
You hear that, Genesis?

18:24.404 --> 18:25.803
Anything is possible.

18:25.805 --> 18:27.772
I'm gonna need you to walk soon,
sweetie.

18:27.774 --> 18:29.073
[ Coos ]

18:29.075 --> 18:30.475
Happy birthday.

18:30.477 --> 18:32.276
I'm sorry
I've been such a jerk lately.

18:32.278 --> 18:35.046
I've been trying to get you
some stupid expensive necklace,

18:35.048 --> 18:38.749
but dmx helped me realize
it's not about presents,

18:38.751 --> 18:40.251
it's about<i> presence.</i>

18:40.253 --> 18:41.786
Oh, I'd rather have a necklace.

18:42.455 --> 18:43.788
Psych!

18:43.790 --> 18:46.057
Dmx drove his El-do
to my house!

18:46.059 --> 18:48.292
This is the best birthday gift
I've ever gotten!

18:49.729 --> 18:50.962
Take care of tomiko.

18:50.964 --> 18:53.097
And be sure to use fertilizer
without urea.

18:53.099 --> 18:54.899
¶ The brother got the rap ¶

18:54.901 --> 19:01.439
and that's how bagel mondays can
turn into productive Tuesdays.

19:01.441 --> 19:03.741
Okay, we're gonna
shift gears a little bit

19:03.743 --> 19:06.844
and have some fun with
some role-play improv exercises.

19:06.846 --> 19:08.980
We call this jobprov,

19:08.982 --> 19:12.416
because success
doesn't come with a script.

19:12.418 --> 19:16.587
Okay, I need two volunteers
to help us get started.

19:16.589 --> 19:19.023
Yes, blonde lady in the front.

19:19.025 --> 19:20.124
And...

19:20.126 --> 19:22.960
Jessica:
Oh, she's married, you perverts.

19:22.962 --> 19:25.596
I volunteer.

19:25.598 --> 19:26.831
Great.

19:28.935 --> 19:30.968
So, in this scene,

19:30.970 --> 19:34.438
you are a customer returning
a walkman

19:34.440 --> 19:37.942
to a manager at circuit city.

19:37.944 --> 19:41.512
And... Jobprov!

19:41.514 --> 19:43.514
What are you doing here?

19:43.516 --> 19:46.017
Showing you
your friendship matters.

19:46.019 --> 19:48.286
But you hate this stuff.

19:48.288 --> 19:49.787
You think it's a waste of money.

19:49.789 --> 19:50.821
I do.

19:50.823 --> 19:52.523
But you don't.

19:52.525 --> 19:54.992
And we're partners.

19:54.994 --> 19:57.128
I'm sorry, honey.

19:58.731 --> 20:00.631
I'm sorry, too.

20:00.633 --> 20:01.966
I miss you.

20:01.968 --> 20:04.135
Hello kitty was right.

20:04.137 --> 20:06.971
There is such a thing
as a best friend.

20:06.973 --> 20:08.039
[ Chuckles ]

20:08.041 --> 20:09.874
Hello kitty.

20:09.876 --> 20:12.243
Frog best friend keroppi.

20:12.245 --> 20:14.412
[ Chuckles ]

20:16.382 --> 20:19.150
And... Scene.

20:19.152 --> 20:21.752
Okay.
That was terrible.

20:21.754 --> 20:23.721
Really just the worst.

20:23.723 --> 20:25.089
There was no walkman.

20:25.091 --> 20:27.358
Even if there was, I don't know
why she's returning it.

20:27.360 --> 20:29.694
Apparently there are no doors
at this circuit city,

20:29.696 --> 20:33.064
if that's even where we were,
because nobody mentioned it.

20:33.066 --> 20:35.266
And from an h.R. Standpoint,

20:35.268 --> 20:38.836
a long interracial
same-sex hug?

20:38.838 --> 20:43.741
Now, this is exactly why arby's
is a shadow of its former self.

20:43.743 --> 20:46.344
I [Laughs]

20:46.346 --> 20:48.112
[ Scoffs ]

20:51.618 --> 20:53.584
Once Jerry finishes installing
the water heater,

20:53.586 --> 20:55.920
we will be all set
for the open house.

20:55.922 --> 20:57.855
Thank you for going back to
the original list date.

20:57.857 --> 20:58.923
No, you were right.

20:58.925 --> 21:01.125
It would have been silly
to wait three months.

21:01.127 --> 21:04.128
Madame xing
doesn't know everything.

21:04.130 --> 21:07.798
Okay, so, good news...
Water heater fit perfectly.

21:07.800 --> 21:12.103
Bad news... you guys have black
mold all through your attic.

21:12.105 --> 21:13.537
- Black mold?
- Oh, yeah.

21:13.539 --> 21:15.873
And it is
a serious health hazard.

21:15.875 --> 21:17.975
I don't even want to be standing
here, breathing this air.

21:17.977 --> 21:19.577
Like, I need to get out.

21:19.579 --> 21:21.279
Okay, but it is
absolutely illegal

21:21.281 --> 21:22.580
for you to sell this house
until you have it removed.

21:22.582 --> 21:24.115
But how long will that take?

21:24.117 --> 21:25.383
About three months.

21:25.385 --> 21:27.818
No way.

21:27.820 --> 21:30.187
We just got xing'd.
