You still get to
go to Griffonstone!

02:42.762 --> 02:46.497
And according to this book, it
has a rich, fascinating history.

02:48.100 --> 02:50.568
In ancient times, griffons
were known to be as greedy

02:50.570 --> 02:54.372
as dragons, always hoarding
their bits and other treasures.

02:54.374 --> 02:56.307
But all that changed
when King Grover

02:56.309 --> 02:59.544
found the mysterious
golden idol of Boreas!

02:59.546 --> 03:01.646
Legend says the idol
of Boreas was made

03:01.648 --> 03:03.648
from the dust of
golden sunsets,

03:03.650 --> 03:06.417
blown across the mountains
by the north winds.

03:06.419 --> 03:08.119
Possessing the idol of Boreas

03:08.121 --> 03:10.288
filled the griffons'
hearts with pride.

03:10.290 --> 03:13.090
It's said that that one great
treasure is responsible

03:13.092 --> 03:15.693
for turning Griffonstone into
the most majestic kingdom

03:15.695 --> 03:17.328
of all the land!

03:17.330 --> 03:21.032
And why do you care so much
about griffons, anyway?

03:21.034 --> 03:23.467
It was actually Gilda's
visit that made me curious.

03:23.469 --> 03:26.304
So I picked up "Bygone
Griffons of Greatness"

03:26.306 --> 03:28.039
and I've been hooked ever since.

03:28.041 --> 03:31.342

to see Griffonstone

03:31.344 --> 03:33.177

11:36.662 --> 11:38.062
[big inhale]

11:38.064 --> 11:39.096
You can't sing here.

11:40.799 --> 11:43.200
But how do you break into
uplifting musical numbers

11:43.202 --> 11:44.501
with no singing?

11:44.503 --> 11:47.071
Yeah, that's Griffonstone's
biggest problem.

11:47.073 --> 11:49.206
Lack of uplifting
musical numbers.

11:49.208 --> 11:51.809
Well, if I can't sing,
how 'bout a party?

11:51.811 --> 11:53.410
If there's one thing
these griffons need,

11:53.412 --> 11:55.079
it's some good cheer.

11:55.081 --> 11:56.580
Where's your party store?

11:58.149 --> 11:59.316
No party store?

11:59.318 --> 12:00.718
Aw. How about cake?

12:00.720 --> 12:02.252
Nothing cheers
folks up like cake!

12:02.254 --> 12:03.587
Where's your bakery?

12:03.589 --> 12:05.222
[groan]

12:05.224 --> 12:06.190
NO SINGING?

12:06.192 --> 12:07.324
NO PARTY STORE?

12:07.326 --> 12:08.759
NO BAKERY?

12:08.761 --> 12:10.494
WHAT IS THIS PLACE?

12:10.496 --> 12:13.497
You're welcome to
leave at any time.

12:13.499 --> 12:14.465
[crash]

12:17.102 --> 12:18.469
Well, that just takes the cake.

12:18.471 --> 12:21.638
It can't take the cake
cause there is no cake!

12:21.640 --> 12:22.773
Or muffins!

12:22.775 --> 12:24.641
Or Griffon Scones!

12:24.643 --> 12:26.343
Oh, we got Griffon Scones.

12:26.345 --> 12:27.611
That's my specialty.

12:27.613 --> 12:28.712
I'll buy one!

12:30.682 --> 12:31.648
[chomp]

12:31.650 --> 12:32.716
Bits first.

12:37.489 --> 12:40.791
[crackling]

12:40.793 --> 12:42.025
Well?

12:42.027 --> 12:43.660
[crackling]

12:43.662 --> 12:45.562
What, you like it?

12:45.564 --> 12:48.332
That's my Grampa
Gruff's secret recipe.

12:48.334 --> 12:49.700
[snap]

12:49.702 --> 12:52.236
Ow! I think I broke a tooth.

12:52.238 --> 12:55.038
Well, whatever, no refunds.

12:55.040 --> 12:56.640
I don't even care anyway.

12:56.642 --> 12:58.242
I just want to sell
enough of these

12:58.244 --> 13:00.310
so I can leave this lousy town.

13:01.346 --> 13:02.679
I can help you with that!

13:04.215 --> 13:07.151
[whistling wind]

13:07.153 --> 13:10.220
Uh, you think you could
tighten the strap on my helmet?

13:10.222 --> 13:11.722
Can you give me more bits?

13:13.124 --> 13:14.224
Never mind.

13:14.226 --> 13:15.659
I got it.

13:15.661 --> 13:18.295
So how deep is this abyss?

13:18.297 --> 13:20.030
How deep are your pockets?

13:20.032 --> 13:23.433
Don't you griffons ever talk
about anything but bits?

13:23.435 --> 13:25.569
Give me some bits
and I'll answer.

13:25.571 --> 13:28.071
No wonder Gilda's
such a delight.

13:29.774 --> 13:32.042
Grampa Gruff's recipe is good,

13:32.044 --> 13:34.278
but it's missing one
important ingredient.

13:34.280 --> 13:36.680
Don't tell me...friendship?

13:36.682 --> 13:37.748
Uh, no.

13:37.750 --> 13:39.449
Baking powder.

13:39.451 --> 13:41.552
Lucky for you I never
leave home without it!

13:42.720 --> 13:45.289
Now just pop those in the oven
and you'll have Griffon Scones

13:45.291 --> 13:47.024
worth their weight in gold!

13:48.226 --> 13:49.493
[sniff sniff]

13:49.495 --> 13:50.694
[crash]

13:50.696 --> 13:51.695
Oof!

13:52.697 --> 13:53.730
Greta!

13:56.234 --> 13:57.501
Pinkie: AH-HA!

13:57.503 --> 13:58.735
I saw that, Gilda!

13:58.737 --> 14:00.637
You may act like a
gruff, grumbling griffon,

14:00.639 --> 14:02.673
but inside you're
gracious and great!

14:02.675 --> 14:06.677
You just helped your friend
up when she got knocked down.

14:06.679 --> 14:08.345
What, her?

14:08.347 --> 14:10.380
Greta's just some
griffon I know.

14:10.382 --> 14:12.316
We don't have friends here.

14:12.318 --> 14:17.621
I did have a friend once, but
you saw how that turned out.

14:21.125 --> 14:22.059
Oh my gosh!

14:22.061 --> 14:23.493
I gotta go find Rainbow Dash!

14:23.495 --> 14:25.229
See ya.

14:25.231 --> 14:29.199
[whistling wind]

14:29.201 --> 14:32.436
You sure we can't just fly down?

14:32.438 --> 14:34.605
Whoa!

14:34.607 --> 14:36.039
Never mind.

14:36.041 --> 14:37.708
Totally got my answer there.

14:42.747 --> 14:45.749
We just gotta find that Golden
Idol and get out of this place!

14:48.453 --> 14:49.453
[snap]

14:49.455 --> 14:50.520
Aaaaah!

14:51.556 --> 14:52.456
Oof!

14:52.458 --> 14:53.557
Oh! Owww!

14:53.559 --> 14:54.558
Ooh!

14:54.560 --> 14:55.559
My hoof!

14:55.561 --> 14:56.560
Help!

14:56.562 --> 14:57.594
Throw me another rope!

14:57.596 --> 14:59.062
You got bits?

15:03.301 --> 15:04.167
Wait!

15:04.169 --> 15:05.502
HELP!

15:13.511 --> 15:20.584
[whistling wind]

15:25.056 --> 15:26.623
AHHHHH!

15:26.625 --> 15:28.425
Pinkie: There you are!

15:28.427 --> 15:30.193
Forget about finding the idol.

15:30.195 --> 15:33.230
I figured out how to solve
Griffonstone's real problem!

15:33.232 --> 15:34.765
SCONES!

15:34.767 --> 15:37.567
PINKIE PIE, YOU GET BACK HERE!

15:37.569 --> 15:39.136
Yeah?

15:39.138 --> 15:41.438
Can you throw down
a rope or something?

15:41.440 --> 15:42.439
Lemme look.

15:44.475 --> 15:46.009
One rope, comin' up!

15:51.349 --> 15:52.482
We need help!

15:53.718 --> 15:56.086
Don't go anywhere!

15:56.088 --> 15:58.288
Where does she
think I'm gonna go?

15:58.290 --> 15:59.423
[crack]

15:59.425 --> 16:00.390
Unh!

16:00.392 --> 16:01.959
I hope I don't go anywhere!

16:08.132 --> 16:10.567
Rainbow Dash is stuck on a
ledge in the Abysmal Abyss

16:10.569 --> 16:13.070
and I need your
help to save her!

16:13.072 --> 16:14.271
Not my problem.

16:14.273 --> 16:15.539
Of course it's your problem!

16:15.541 --> 16:16.740
She's your friend!

16:16.742 --> 16:18.342
Used to be.

16:18.344 --> 16:20.444
Can't you remember when she was?

16:20.446 --> 16:22.145
Yeah.

16:22.147 --> 16:23.280
Of course.

16:35.727 --> 16:38.161
Doesn't that griffon know that
she's supposed to fly

16:38.163 --> 16:41.131
at the Junior
Speedsters Flight Camp?

16:41.133 --> 16:44.134
Maybe she just doesn't
want to make you look bad.

16:46.204 --> 16:47.070
Hey there!

16:47.072 --> 16:48.205
I'm Rainbow Dash.

16:48.207 --> 16:49.706
And you are...?

16:49.708 --> 16:53.176
Uh, G-Gilda?

16:53.178 --> 16:54.644
You sure about that?

16:56.347 --> 16:57.748
Stick with me, Gilda,

16:57.750 --> 17:00.450
and those guys won't
give you any more guff!

17:05.089 --> 17:06.523
Whoa! You're awesome!

17:06.525 --> 17:07.691
[giggle]

17:07.693 --> 17:09.626
You too, Rainbow Dash!

17:11.696 --> 17:14.364
[whoosh]

17:14.366 --> 17:17.634
Well, Gilda, let's show
these guys how it's done.

17:20.471 --> 17:22.739
Junior Speedsters are our lives!

17:22.741 --> 17:25.308
Sky bound soars
and daring dives!

17:25.310 --> 17:27.677
Junior Speedsters
it's our quest,

17:27.679 --> 17:30.380
to someday be the VERY BEST!

17:33.684 --> 17:34.551
Fine.

17:34.553 --> 17:37.421
But that doesn't
make me her friend.

17:37.423 --> 17:38.522
Duly noted.

17:39.757 --> 17:42.392
Except it does.

17:43.628 --> 17:48.565
[whistling wind]

17:48.567 --> 17:50.767
Hang on, loser!

17:50.769 --> 17:54.037
I'm coming!

17:54.039 --> 17:57.074
What took you so long, doofus?

18:01.646 --> 18:02.579
[scream]

18:02.581 --> 18:03.647
RAINBOW DASH!

18:03.649 --> 18:05.248
I'M COMIN' FOR YA!

18:07.151 --> 18:08.418
AAAAAAHHHH!

18:12.090 --> 18:13.056
Gotcha!

18:15.159 --> 18:16.960
Hold on, you two!

18:16.962 --> 18:18.462
[grunts]

18:18.464 --> 18:19.529
Huh?

18:21.532 --> 18:22.699
[gasp]

18:26.137 --> 18:28.538
The idol of Boreas!

18:28.540 --> 18:33.443
[grunts]

18:33.445 --> 18:34.544
I'm slipping!

18:34.546 --> 18:37.481
[grunts]

18:37.483 --> 18:39.049
AAAAAAAAHHHHHHH!

18:52.296 --> 18:53.263
[snap]

18:53.265 --> 18:58.368
You're more important to me
than some dumb chunk of gold!

18:59.470 --> 19:01.037
[crumbling]

19:01.039 --> 19:02.038
Hugging later!

19:02.040 --> 19:03.440
Climbing NOW!

19:10.181 --> 19:13.316
I'm really sorry about
how I treated you two.

19:13.318 --> 19:14.518
Thanks, Gilda.

19:14.520 --> 19:16.453
Apology accepted.

19:16.455 --> 19:19.055
And I'm just sorry we
didn't get your idol back.

19:19.057 --> 19:22.459
Now we'll never be able to
solve Griffonstone's problem.

19:22.461 --> 19:24.728
That's what I was
trying to tell you!

19:24.730 --> 19:27.664
The map didn't send us here to
find the lost idol of Boreas.

19:27.666 --> 19:30.500
It sent us here to replace
it with something better!

19:30.502 --> 19:33.470
Nothing's better than
gold to a griffon.

19:33.472 --> 19:36.072
That's because you
don't have friendship.

19:36.074 --> 19:38.341
If you can learn to care
about each other again,

19:38.343 --> 19:42.746
Griffonstone could be a mightier
kingdom than it ever was before!

19:42.748 --> 19:45.582
And you don't need some
golden idol to do that.

19:45.584 --> 19:48.051
You just need each other.

19:48.053 --> 19:49.085
Whoa, Pinkie.

19:49.087 --> 19:52.055
That was...really sappy.

19:52.057 --> 19:53.490
What can I say?

19:53.492 --> 19:54.691
That's how I roll.

19:56.594 --> 19:57.661
Go on, Gilda.

19:57.663 --> 19:59.262
Go make a friend.

20:05.103 --> 20:08.471
You really think these
griffons are up for this?

20:08.473 --> 20:10.740
We aren't exactly in
Ponyville, you know.

20:16.648 --> 20:21.418
So she was really weirded out
until I gave her the scone.

20:21.420 --> 20:24.788
Then she tried it and
said it tasted good!

20:24.790 --> 20:29.125
That's the first nice thing
any griffon's ever said to me!

20:31.096 --> 20:35.031
I guess that really was the
problem we needed to solve.

20:35.033 --> 20:37.500
Baking powder makes baked
goods and friendships

20:37.502 --> 20:39.102
fluffy and delicious!

20:41.505 --> 20:43.173
Well, we better
be headin' home.

20:43.175 --> 20:47.077
What? You want me to spread
friendship here by myself?

20:47.079 --> 20:48.378
How am I supposed to do that?

20:48.380 --> 20:51.081
I haven't even made
one single friend yet!

20:51.083 --> 20:52.749
No, you haven't.

20:52.751 --> 20:54.584
You've made two.

20:54.586 --> 20:55.452
Hugging!

20:55.454 --> 20:57.120
Hugging now!

20:58.756 --> 21:01.658
But you'll come back
and visit, right?

21:01.660 --> 21:03.660
Just try and stop us!

21:14.538 --> 21:17.340
See you later,
you old charmer.

21:17.342 --> 21:18.775
Uh, Pinkie?

21:18.777 --> 21:23.413
Nopony. Come on, let's go
home and see how Gummy did

21:23.415 --> 21:26.349
with Granny Pie's
marjolaine recipe...

21:31.355 --> 21:33.757

21:35.526 --> 21:38.128
