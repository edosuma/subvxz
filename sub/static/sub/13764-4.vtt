<i>Sam?</i>

00:05.352 --> 00:06.268
<i>Sam?</i>

00:08.800 --> 00:10.538
<i>Can you hear me?</i>

00:14.943 --> 00:16.235
<i>It's Mum.</i>

00:18.812 --> 00:19.756
<i>Sam?</i>

00:21.404 --> 00:22.548
<i>Sammie?</i>

00:25.061 --> 00:25.943
Mum?

00:26.458 --> 00:27.445
<i>Sammie.</i>

00:29.210 --> 00:30.240
Ivanhoe.

00:32.615 --> 00:33.760
<i>Sammie?</i>

00:34.493 --> 00:35.506
Mum!

00:53.339 --> 00:55.870
Hello. Do you know a little boy
who lives round here?

00:55.954 --> 00:58.670
Sam Tyler. He'd be
about four years old.

00:58.701 --> 01:02.568
I'm not meant to talk to strange men.
Are you a strange man?

01:02.752 --> 01:06.681
- I think I probably am, yeah.
- Jane! Come here.

01:06.711 --> 01:09.320
Excuse me.
I'm just looking for a...

01:14.885 --> 01:16.128
Can I help you?

01:16.175 --> 01:18.799
Help yourself, mate, is what you can do.
Keep on walking.

01:19.561 --> 01:20.818
I'm a police officer.

01:20.849 --> 01:21.894
Good for you!

01:21.989 --> 01:25.902
He's been a bit of a greedy boy and
I'm just reminding him of the rules.

01:26.114 --> 01:27.331
Did you hear what I said?

01:27.402 --> 01:29.012
I said I'm a police officer.

01:29.091 --> 01:31.597
I'm working here,
now run along!

01:31.676 --> 01:32.399
Bugger!

01:32.909 --> 01:33.585
Oi!

01:41.725 --> 01:43.828
What the hell
do you think you're doing?!

01:43.936 --> 01:45.567
I'm arresting you for assault.

01:46.115 --> 01:48.876
You do not have to say anything
but it may harm your defence,

01:48.933 --> 01:50.663
if you do not mention
when questioned

01:50.713 --> 01:53.032
something which you
later rely on in court.

01:53.082 --> 01:54.521
That's not how it goes!

01:55.976 --> 01:57.630
Big mistake, copper!

01:58.150 --> 01:59.696
<i>My name is Sam Tyler.</i>

01:59.937 --> 02:02.905
<i>I had an accident
and I woke up in 1973.</i>

02:02.964 --> 02:06.415
<i>Am i mad? In a coma?
Or back in time?</i>

02:06.506 --> 02:10.014
<i>Whatever's happened, it's like
I've landed on a different planet.</i>

02:10.180 --> 02:13.680
<i>Now maybe if I can work out
a reason, I can get home.</i>

03:04.894 --> 03:07.155
Alright love.
New, is he?

03:07.205 --> 03:08.019
Shut up.

03:08.094 --> 03:10.539
I want it written down
that I had nothing to do with it!

03:12.500 --> 03:14.769
- What's the charge?
- Assaulting this man.

03:14.861 --> 03:17.430
No he didn't!
We were just wrestling.

03:17.605 --> 03:18.943
And resisting arrest.

03:18.993 --> 03:21.105
Shall you tell him,
darling, or shall I?

03:22.094 --> 03:23.765
Number three's empty.

03:30.206 --> 03:32.186
- What you got then?
- Crisp.

03:32.818 --> 03:35.204
Bastard.
He's drawn the favourite.

03:36.014 --> 03:37.178
There you go boss.

03:41.501 --> 03:42.964
"Proud Percy"

03:44.627 --> 03:46.830
Sweepstake for the
Grand National on Saturday.

03:47.097 --> 03:49.159
Can somebody put
some bog roll in the loo?

03:49.192 --> 03:51.794
I've just had to wipe my arse
on Francis Lee.

03:56.433 --> 03:57.389
Red Rum.

03:57.598 --> 03:58.820
Never heard of him.

03:59.020 --> 04:01.165
I'll swap you Red Rum for Proud Percy.

04:01.663 --> 04:02.744
Why?

04:03.700 --> 04:05.213
Redrum, Redrum.

04:08.150 --> 04:10.034
I just like his name.

04:10.115 --> 04:12.145
You got inside information?

04:12.453 --> 04:14.094
- Guv?
- What?

04:14.175 --> 04:16.172
- Charlie Edwards.
- What about him?

04:16.254 --> 04:18.413
Some prat just arrested him.

04:23.781 --> 04:25.174
Who is this Charlie Edwards?

04:25.216 --> 04:26.779
An unpleasant little scrotum

04:26.813 --> 04:29.041
what we in the business
call a "necessary evil".

04:29.088 --> 04:29.995
I don't get it.

04:30.089 --> 04:31.474
Don't know what it's like in Hyde,

04:31.506 --> 04:33.713
but in A Division we use
checks and balances.

04:33.746 --> 04:35.268
It works very nicely,
thank you,

04:35.302 --> 04:38.569
until some dill from the suburbs
starts waving his willy around.

04:38.620 --> 04:40.075
Checks and balances.

04:40.715 --> 04:43.508
Edwards works for a local businessman,
Stephen Warren.

04:43.550 --> 04:46.866
Mr Warren enjoys
cordial relations with the police.

04:47.390 --> 04:48.613
You're bent.

04:48.679 --> 04:50.292
Bent as a fish-hook!

04:50.333 --> 04:52.952
But he keeps his streets
spotlessly clean.

04:52.986 --> 04:54.607
No burglaries,
no sex crimes,

04:54.625 --> 04:57.753
and he always lets us know if any
unsavoury characters arrive in the city.

04:57.857 --> 04:59.541
And what do we do in return?

04:59.592 --> 05:02.658
For a start, we don't arrest
his right-hand man, okay?

05:08.863 --> 05:10.338
Mr Hunt.

05:10.432 --> 05:12.354
No need to apologise.

05:12.521 --> 05:14.059
It was just an honest mistake.

05:14.258 --> 05:15.349
What's going on?

05:15.525 --> 05:18.716
The assault charge against
Mr Edwards has been dropped.

05:18.820 --> 05:20.472
What about resisting arrest?

05:20.628 --> 05:22.094
That's been dropped too.

05:22.197 --> 05:24.983
I've left some free passes
for the boys and girls, Mr Hunt,

05:25.034 --> 05:26.738
just to show
there's no hard feelings.

05:26.780 --> 05:28.692
Hang on!
He's my detainee.

05:28.734 --> 05:31.384
- I say when he gets released.
- Shut it.

05:31.539 --> 05:33.337
Right, on your way,
and don't push it.

05:33.576 --> 05:35.074
Of course no, Mr Hunt.

05:35.136 --> 05:37.162
See you again, hero.

05:39.625 --> 05:41.433
What are you doing tonight?

05:41.807 --> 05:43.314
I can't believe
what I've just seen.

05:43.366 --> 05:45.562
Right, cancel it.
You're having a drink with me.

05:46.152 --> 05:47.731
You said a quiet little pub.

05:47.804 --> 05:49.093
- Did I?
- Evening, Mr Hunt.

05:49.176 --> 05:50.558
Don't scratch it.

05:52.762 --> 05:54.616
This is Warren's place, isn't it?

05:54.689 --> 05:57.758
- There's no flies on you, are there?
- What're we doing here?

05:57.991 --> 06:00.998
Furthering your education
so you don't start a war.

06:01.109 --> 06:03.122
I don't want anything
to do with it.

06:03.343 --> 06:05.234
You are to do with it.

06:06.302 --> 06:08.548
You don't throw stones in my pond.

06:08.696 --> 06:11.102
I've seen where
this sort of thing leads.

06:11.225 --> 06:14.159
And now we have to apologise.
I say "we" but I mean "you".

06:14.196 --> 06:17.364
No chance!
I've got nothing to apologise for!

06:29.369 --> 06:31.259
Hey boss! Over here!

06:39.041 --> 06:39.851
Hello!

06:40.097 --> 06:41.938
Didn't think
this'd be your scene!

06:42.012 --> 06:43.338
Do you come here often?

06:43.399 --> 06:45.203
Only when we get in free
on the guest list.

06:45.253 --> 06:46.566
Oi! Sam!

06:47.217 --> 06:49.058
I need to talk to you
about something.

06:49.537 --> 06:52.275
A much-loved orange cat
called Ivanhoe.

06:54.428 --> 06:55.717
VIP lounge, love.

06:55.754 --> 06:57.545
I don't think
that includes off-duty slags

06:57.608 --> 06:59.339
with glitter in their hair, do you?

07:10.314 --> 07:11.710
Bobby Charlton.

07:11.910 --> 07:13.797
Yeah, and Francis Lee.

07:14.288 --> 07:15.654
Denis Law?

07:16.698 --> 07:19.475
Half a million pounds
wouldn't buy you that lot.

07:21.087 --> 07:22.698
Oh my God.

07:23.066 --> 07:24.202
What?

07:24.708 --> 07:26.273
Marc Bolan.

07:26.856 --> 07:27.869
Who?

07:27.946 --> 07:30.140
Marc Bolan.
Lead singer with T. Rex.

07:30.217 --> 07:32.872
Yeah, yeah, whatever.
I'll go and tell Warren we're here.

07:32.980 --> 07:35.078
If God were to appear in my room,

07:35.110 --> 07:37.537
obviously I'd be in awe,
but I don't think I'd be humble.

07:37.614 --> 07:39.410
Excuse me, Mr Bolan?

07:39.517 --> 07:41.312
What happened to your hair, man?

07:42.789 --> 07:44.953
I just wanted to say
I'm a big fan.

07:45.030 --> 07:46.779
- Thanks.
- Sam!

07:49.464 --> 07:53.730
Listen. Drive carefully, okay?
Especially in Minis.

07:59.116 --> 08:01.602
- What?
- Nothing.

08:02.967 --> 08:05.668
Now listen, don't say
anything stupid to Warren.

08:05.776 --> 08:09.044
Remember, he keeps a lid on
a lot of crap that goes on in this city,

08:09.091 --> 08:11.254
so you can get down off
your high Hyde horse.

08:11.331 --> 08:13.541
I'm still not apologising.

08:17.658 --> 08:18.794
So...

08:19.500 --> 08:21.848
You're the caped crusader,
Mr Tyler.

08:21.894 --> 08:25.438
I saw a man assaulting
another man. I did my job.

08:25.592 --> 08:27.847
He's very big
on doing his job.

08:27.939 --> 08:29.858
Glad to hear it.

08:31.500 --> 08:34.030
It was a regrettable incident.

08:34.845 --> 08:38.282
I believe you have something to say
to Detective Inspector Tyler?

08:38.357 --> 08:41.903
Sorry about earlier, sir.
Won't happen again.

08:44.911 --> 08:46.293
Cigar, Mr Hunt.

08:46.814 --> 08:47.733
Ta.

08:49.147 --> 08:52.154
Please, Mr Tyler.
It won't explode.

08:56.989 --> 09:01.485
Now, if you'll forgive us, I just want
a quick word with your man here.

09:07.117 --> 09:08.974
You, enjoy yourself.

09:11.215 --> 09:12.826
I'll be right with you.

09:13.210 --> 09:15.143
Keep mine warm.

09:27.616 --> 09:29.396
So you work for Warren, yeah?

09:29.488 --> 09:30.884
Don't we all.

09:57.591 --> 09:59.156
What we doing here?

10:00.231 --> 10:02.133
Bit of business to sort out.

10:02.993 --> 10:04.803
What sort of business?

10:05.954 --> 10:10.389
Some dodgy hippies have been
fencing stolen electrical goods.

10:11.080 --> 10:13.581
And that's a job for CID, is it?

10:14.026 --> 10:16.221
You can stay here
if you want.

10:25.938 --> 10:27.181
Who the hell are you?

10:27.258 --> 10:30.511
Is there anything in this world
more revolting than a dishonest hippie?

10:30.571 --> 10:32.336
We don't want any trouble, man.

10:34.745 --> 10:36.602
Do you know
what I'd do if I were you?

10:36.648 --> 10:38.167
Apart from wash
my hair, obviously?

10:38.275 --> 10:38.981
What?

10:39.180 --> 10:42.709
I'd pack my shitty unironed clothes
and be out of this city by daybreak.

10:43.001 --> 10:46.469
I take it you boys have got
receipts for these TVs, yeah?

10:47.590 --> 10:48.695
Er, guv...

10:49.707 --> 10:51.364
- Do it!
- Stick him!

10:51.533 --> 10:53.482
Stick it, stick the pig!

10:54.111 --> 10:55.937
Stick it, Royston!

10:58.746 --> 11:00.326
Stay there!

11:02.994 --> 11:04.651
It's a horrible concept, innit,

11:04.743 --> 11:07.966
huge psychotic hippies
fencing stolen tellies.

11:10.391 --> 11:12.539
This has nothing to do with me.

11:12.647 --> 11:15.747
Oh, stop being such a girl.
Think of it as a tax on bad people.

11:15.854 --> 11:18.125
What is that, mon brave?

11:18.783 --> 11:21.315
- It's a television.
- In a pub?

11:21.392 --> 11:23.341
Yeah, ask the boy wonder here.

11:24.016 --> 11:27.530
- It's nothing to do with me.
- Oi, tell him what you told me.

11:27.837 --> 11:31.274
Well, I could make some brackets
and we could put it on the wall...

11:31.382 --> 11:32.840
and watch the sport.

11:32.993 --> 11:34.267
In a pub?

11:34.358 --> 11:37.719
Right, large whisky for the
short-haired man who saved my bacon.

11:37.980 --> 11:41.724
You're making bacon?
Well done, boss.

11:52.923 --> 11:55.654
That should keep Warren
off our backs for a while.

11:57.956 --> 12:00.534
Hang on.
We just did that for Warren?

12:01.608 --> 12:04.462
He brought their existence
to our attention, let's say.

12:04.524 --> 12:06.687
Why's he give this to me?
I didn't do anything.

12:06.826 --> 12:09.081
Money for old rope then, innit?

12:10.685 --> 12:12.619
I don't want anything
to do with this.

12:12.711 --> 12:15.319
It's too late, pal,
you took the cigar. Now...

12:15.427 --> 12:18.588
Get the drinks in and grow up.

12:36.282 --> 12:39.074
I've always despised bent cops.

12:39.569 --> 12:42.653
What did you have to do for it?
That's the question.

12:44.019 --> 12:47.840
Danced with a pretty girl.
Smoked a cigar.

12:48.009 --> 12:50.372
It's hardly Watergate, my friend.

12:52.628 --> 12:54.347
I'm losing it, Nelson.

12:55.144 --> 12:58.198
I'm forgetting who I am
in all this madness.

13:02.573 --> 13:04.630
I just want to go home.

13:04.967 --> 13:06.625
Me too, Sam.

13:07.745 --> 13:09.648
Close the door on your way out.

13:23.472 --> 13:26.664
<i>Come on children. Who wants
to sing with Mister Socky?</i>

13:26.848 --> 13:30.715
<i>Everyone wants to sing
with Mister Socky!</i>

13:31.190 --> 13:34.136
<i>And we will sing.</i>

13:34.366 --> 13:37.297
<i>Harris! Julia!</i>

13:37.758 --> 13:40.336
<i>Let's all sing.</i>

13:41.225 --> 13:44.494
<i>Wendy? Henry?</i>

13:44.709 --> 13:46.029
<i>Sam?</i>

13:46.872 --> 13:47.885
<i>Sam?</i>

13:49.618 --> 13:52.534
<i>What have they done
to my beautiful boy?</i>

13:52.658 --> 13:55.205
- Mum?
- <i>Can you hear me?</i>

13:55.358 --> 13:57.798
<i>Can you hear what I'm saying?</i>

13:58.380 --> 14:02.032
- <i>Sam... don't leave us.</i>
- Mum?

14:23.842 --> 14:25.591
Old iron!

14:31.201 --> 14:32.468
Alfie.

14:38.933 --> 14:40.652
Ivanhoe!

14:44.657 --> 14:47.112
Ivanhoe! It's me, Sammie.

15:18.058 --> 15:19.116
Yes?

15:23.415 --> 15:24.996
Can I help you?

15:29.799 --> 15:31.824
Detective Inspector...

15:32.914 --> 15:34.126
Bolan.

15:35.354 --> 15:38.852
There's been a spate
of burglaries in the area and...

15:39.344 --> 15:41.645
We're making
door-to-door enquiries.

15:41.722 --> 15:46.126
Burglaries? I didn't think
we had any, not around here.

15:49.878 --> 15:52.072
Would you like to come in?

15:57.842 --> 16:00.911
You'll have to forgive me.
I was just doing the washing-up.

16:01.123 --> 16:02.980
Not at all, Mrs Tyler.

16:06.291 --> 16:08.976
- Would you like to go through?
- Thanks.

16:29.263 --> 16:31.841
How did you know our name?

16:33.253 --> 16:35.693
It... it's all in the records.

16:36.475 --> 16:38.992
Real life detective in the house.

16:39.238 --> 16:41.156
My son would be very impressed.

16:44.378 --> 16:45.913
Is he at school?

16:46.020 --> 16:48.890
He's upstairs, in his room.
Mumps.

16:51.299 --> 16:53.800
I'm really surprised
about burglaries.

16:53.905 --> 16:58.293
We move around a lot and this is
the safest place we've ever been.

16:58.524 --> 17:01.086
Have you got time
for a cup of tea?

17:01.270 --> 17:02.390
Yeah.

17:04.217 --> 17:06.349
What does your husband do,
Mrs Tyler?

17:06.411 --> 17:09.464
He's a salesman.
A not very good one at the moment,

17:09.540 --> 17:13.209
So if anyone does try and burgle us,
they'll be very disappointed.

17:16.147 --> 17:20.137
That's funny. He normally
only likes me and Sammie.

17:22.685 --> 17:24.648
I wonder
if I should wake Sam up?

17:24.756 --> 17:27.150
He'll be really disappointed
to have missed you.

17:27.348 --> 17:29.007
No, don't wake him up.

17:29.099 --> 17:32.383
He wants to be a policeman
one day. So he says.

17:32.766 --> 17:34.316
He will be.

17:37.931 --> 17:39.205
Your husband?

17:40.601 --> 17:44.330
Mr Carroway, I'd really prefer it
if you didn't just let yourself in.

17:44.453 --> 17:47.201
My husband's away on business,
and as soon as he gets back, I'll...

17:47.247 --> 17:50.039
- A problem, Mrs Tyler?
- The mouse do play, I see.

17:50.116 --> 17:53.415
Mr Carroway,
this is Detective Inspector Bolan.

17:53.922 --> 17:57.221
As soon as my husband gets back,
he'll pay you this month's rent.

17:57.282 --> 17:59.446
Not to mention
the two months before that.

17:59.538 --> 18:00.888
You know,  there's a law

18:00.950 --> 18:03.682
against landlords letting themselves
in to tenanted property.

18:03.758 --> 18:04.986
No there's not.

18:05.032 --> 18:06.459
You can leave now,
Mr Carroway,

18:06.489 --> 18:08.638
or we can discuss this further
down the station.

18:08.699 --> 18:11.124
I answer to Mr Warren.

18:12.141 --> 18:13.185
Yeah?

18:13.798 --> 18:16.668
He won't like it,
he won't like it at all!

18:16.745 --> 18:20.734
I'll be back to get your money later,
Mrs Tyler, when your friend has gone.

18:26.685 --> 18:28.173
I'm sorry.

18:35.892 --> 18:37.749
How much do you owe?

18:37.856 --> 18:39.299
Lots.

18:48.849 --> 18:50.430
What're you doing?

18:50.629 --> 18:53.422
I won some money on....

18:53.745 --> 18:55.064
cards.

18:57.236 --> 18:59.231
I don't even know you.

18:59.569 --> 19:01.456
Why would I take money from you?

19:01.513 --> 19:03.283
It doesn't matter.
It's only money.

19:03.336 --> 19:07.034
There's no such thing as "only",
Detective Inspector.

19:07.356 --> 19:09.213
Put your money away.

19:14.731 --> 19:18.122
Look, there's a horse running
in the Grand National.

19:18.721 --> 19:20.301
Red Rum.

19:20.440 --> 19:22.174
Put your housekeeping money on him.

19:22.235 --> 19:24.108
I promise you,
you won't be disappointed.

19:24.170 --> 19:27.315
Put my family's last pennies
on a horse?

19:29.173 --> 19:32.088
You know, you should meet
my husband one day.

19:32.211 --> 19:34.175
You'd get along well.

19:38.396 --> 19:40.728
I think you should go now.

19:51.400 --> 19:53.609
I don't want anything from you.

19:53.747 --> 19:56.863
- Not in the way you think.
- Goodbye, Detective Inspector.

20:19.524 --> 20:20.859
Mr Tyler.

20:20.997 --> 20:24.082
What a pleasure.
Take a seat.

20:27.957 --> 20:30.152
- What's this?
- It's yours.

20:30.228 --> 20:31.502
Really?

20:31.870 --> 20:34.556
- Where did you find it?
- In my pocket.

20:34.632 --> 20:36.919
Can't be mine then.
Must be yours.

20:36.950 --> 20:40.479
If you try and bribe a police
officer again, I will arrest you.

20:40.801 --> 20:42.796
To early for a sharpener, Mr Tyler?

20:42.827 --> 20:46.526
I don't know what kind of deals
you might have with other officers,

20:46.602 --> 20:48.966
but you have no deal with me.

20:49.011 --> 20:49.886
Is that so?

20:49.932 --> 20:51.420
And I'm gonna go out of my way

20:51.466 --> 20:54.228
to make life as difficult
for you as possible.

20:54.505 --> 20:57.988
You're new here, son,
so I'll let that pass.

20:58.065 --> 21:02.055
Others have tried to wear
the white hat, and all have failed.

21:02.208 --> 21:06.719
I just caught one of your... landlords,
harrassing one of your tenants.

21:07.180 --> 21:09.528
Don't ever let me see that again.

21:12.290 --> 21:13.717
What's his name?

21:13.993 --> 21:16.096
I'll see that he's dealt with.

21:18.751 --> 21:20.961
The easy days are over.

21:21.206 --> 21:22.817
I'll be watching you.

21:22.924 --> 21:25.195
So you say, Mr Tyler.

21:25.978 --> 21:28.663
Show the detective inspector out.

21:29.063 --> 21:32.669
- I'll find my own way out.
- What a clever boy.

21:35.308 --> 21:37.809
Not too clever
for your own good, I hope.

21:37.932 --> 21:40.940
Like I said,
I'll be watching you.

21:49.161 --> 21:52.460
- You met your mother?
- I know how it sounds.

21:53.803 --> 21:55.445
You don't believe me, do you?

21:58.529 --> 22:00.171
You look tired.

22:00.478 --> 22:02.273
What do you know
about Warren?

22:04.384 --> 22:05.397
Annie?

22:09.126 --> 22:12.625
Why don't we...
go to the flicks or something?

22:13.749 --> 22:14.951
You can pay.

22:17.566 --> 22:18.717
What's on?

22:18.794 --> 22:20.835
Something called...
"Mean Streets",

22:20.957 --> 22:22.891
or "Carry On Girls".

22:24.502 --> 22:25.776
What?

22:27.602 --> 22:31.515
- How's the corned beef hash?
- It's a triumph, as ever.

22:31.607 --> 22:34.078
There's a girl in the cells
asking after you.

22:34.185 --> 22:37.132
- Who is it?
- Says her name's Joni Newton.

22:37.270 --> 22:38.329
What's it about?

22:38.390 --> 22:40.661
She put a brick through
a Woolworths' front window.

22:41.542 --> 22:43.475
It's hardly CID, that, is it?

22:43.521 --> 22:45.808
She won't speak
to anyone else but you.

22:47.833 --> 22:49.429
I'm frightened.

22:50.457 --> 22:52.758
I'm really, really frightened.

22:54.554 --> 22:55.827
Frightened of who?

22:56.104 --> 22:57.546
Stephen Warren.

23:00.492 --> 23:02.180
Why're you frightened of him?

23:02.334 --> 23:04.298
He says he going to kill me.

23:05.188 --> 23:08.717
But before he does,
he says he's gonna...

23:13.660 --> 23:16.729
I need evidence, Joni.
I can't do anything without evidence.

23:17.020 --> 23:19.076
- No way.
- Help me nail him.

23:19.261 --> 23:21.010
I can't do anything
about a threat.

23:21.163 --> 23:23.527
I'll come back
when I'm dead then, shall I?

23:28.465 --> 23:30.997
Why haven't you told any
of the other officers about this?

23:31.043 --> 23:34.005
Because they would've told Warren and
that would've been the end of me.

23:34.097 --> 23:35.371
What are you implying?

23:35.463 --> 23:39.268
That everyone in this station is bent,
that's what I'm implying.

23:41.157 --> 23:43.949
- I'll have to talk to my DCI.
- No!

23:44.041 --> 23:47.279
No. This place is infested.

23:47.371 --> 23:48.829
You know it is.

23:57.242 --> 23:58.914
What do you want me to do?

23:58.976 --> 24:00.971
I'm not safe at my place.

24:01.155 --> 24:03.626
I'm not safe anywhere
in Manchester.

24:04.301 --> 24:06.342
Just let me stay
with you tonight.

24:11.978 --> 24:15.216
I'll put you in one of the cells
overnight. You'll be safe there.

24:15.721 --> 24:18.130
I can't take you home with me.

24:18.207 --> 24:21.046
You've been arrested
for criminal damage.

24:21.168 --> 24:24.161
- I'm a police officer.
- Then behave like one.

24:24.299 --> 24:26.278
I've come to you
'cause I'm in trouble.

24:26.324 --> 24:29.362
If you let me out of here, I'm dead.

24:29.547 --> 24:32.217
A friend is coming from Liverpool
to pick me up in the morning,

24:32.263 --> 24:35.301
and then you'll never
see me again. I promise.

24:36.903 --> 24:39.097
I've got no one else to turn to.

24:40.202 --> 24:41.261
Please.

24:42.795 --> 24:44.422
Please help me.

24:49.296 --> 24:50.784
Put your coat on.

24:54.897 --> 24:56.171
Watch yourself-

24:56.447 --> 24:58.089
Hello, Joni.

24:58.197 --> 25:01.051
- What you doing here?
- She's a friend of mine.

25:01.112 --> 25:02.171
Is that right?

25:02.263 --> 25:04.549
She's a friend of a lot of people,
aren't you darling?

25:04.596 --> 25:06.007
Not of yours, scumbag.

25:06.053 --> 25:07.573
Does Warren know you're out?

25:07.665 --> 25:10.718
Hey, don't forget to wash
your hands afterwards, <i>sir</i>.

25:19.764 --> 25:21.283
What you doing?

25:21.421 --> 25:22.618
Cooking.

25:23.753 --> 25:25.119
What's that?

25:25.687 --> 25:27.267
It's a mango.

25:28.081 --> 25:29.784
And that thing?

25:30.521 --> 25:32.147
That thing...

25:32.776 --> 25:34.679
is a jalapeño chili.

25:35.477 --> 25:37.901
Isn't it easier just to open
a can of baked beans?

25:38.193 --> 25:39.129
No.

25:39.313 --> 25:42.336
Here. Open some wine. Shut up.

25:42.421 --> 25:43.849
Wine.

25:44.447 --> 25:46.657
You're not your
normal copper, are you?

25:47.485 --> 25:49.357
What time
is your friend getting here?

25:49.449 --> 25:52.932
Five in the morning. We'll be gone
before you're even awake.

25:56.132 --> 25:57.727
Chicken and fruit.

25:57.804 --> 25:59.952
I wouldn't've believed
it could taste so good.

26:00.014 --> 26:01.548
Mexican dish.

26:01.748 --> 26:04.970
A chef in Monterrey
gave me that recipe.

26:05.078 --> 26:06.812
Where's Monterrey?

26:07.756 --> 26:08.983
Mexico.

26:09.075 --> 26:11.224
You've actually been to Mexico?

26:11.837 --> 26:13.710
Were you there for the World Cup?

26:14.155 --> 26:17.699
"Back home,
they'll be thinking about..."

26:17.761 --> 26:19.602
Tell me about Warren.

26:23.982 --> 26:26.729
I've only been working
at the club a few months.

26:27.266 --> 26:29.629
He was really nice
when I first started.

26:29.951 --> 26:32.759
What makes a girl like you
want to work for a fellow like that?

26:32.851 --> 26:35.552
Money.
Same as the rest of the world.

26:37.163 --> 26:38.268
Go on.

26:38.897 --> 26:41.506
I knew some of the girls
did favours for him.

26:41.583 --> 26:44.744
He'd ask them to entertain
important people he wanted to impress.

26:44.824 --> 26:48.094
- What sort of people?
- Politicians. Businessmen.

26:48.644 --> 26:49.980
Coppers.

26:50.451 --> 26:52.818
And then one day,
he asked me if I'd go out to dinner

26:52.857 --> 26:55.509
with some old French bloke
he wanted to do business with.

26:55.724 --> 26:58.218
- And what did you say?
- I said no.

26:59.043 --> 27:00.614
And what did he think
about that?

27:00.654 --> 27:03.354
This is delicious.
Galloping gourmet.

27:03.541 --> 27:04.395
Joni...

27:08.192 --> 27:09.803
I said no again.

27:10.284 --> 27:12.897
And then he got this bloke,
Edwards, into the office.

27:13.289 --> 27:14.537
Yeah, I've met Edwards.

27:14.881 --> 27:16.609
Then you'll know he's disgusting.

27:16.815 --> 27:18.760
Like a disgusting dog.

27:20.224 --> 27:24.123
He pushed me over the desk,
and held my hands down.

27:25.076 --> 27:26.549
They were laughing.

27:26.843 --> 27:28.906
And then Warren lifted up my skirt.

27:30.330 --> 27:32.245
I couldn't see him,
but I could feel...

27:32.304 --> 27:34.504
his breath
on the back of my neck.

27:35.555 --> 27:37.431
He said if I didn't do it,

27:37.558 --> 27:39.071
they'd take it in turns with me,

27:39.130 --> 27:41.064
and chuck me in the canal
when they were done.

27:42.007 --> 27:45.128
It's just... words, Joni.

27:45.160 --> 27:48.126
You know, men like that, they like
to hear the sound of their own voice.

27:48.164 --> 27:50.570
There was this girl
who came to work at the club.

27:50.688 --> 27:51.602
Yvonne.

27:52.210 --> 27:54.273
I liked her.
She was nice to me.

27:55.283 --> 27:58.171
She said she wanted to leave,
and when she told Warren,

27:58.406 --> 28:01.304
he went mad.
Said she couldn't.

28:03.921 --> 28:05.517
What happened to her?

28:05.655 --> 28:07.942
They found her dead
in the gutter.

28:08.172 --> 28:10.443
Hit and run, the police said.

28:10.857 --> 28:13.988
What, and you think
he had her killed?

28:14.111 --> 28:18.591
I don't think. I know.
Everyone knew.

28:21.136 --> 28:22.671
Help me, Sam.

28:32.504 --> 28:35.098
If the phone goes,
don't answer it.

28:35.359 --> 28:37.415
If the door goes...

28:37.553 --> 28:39.241
don't open it.

28:40.423 --> 28:42.079
I'll wake you early.

28:42.171 --> 28:44.397
Get you and your friend
to Liverpool.

28:44.504 --> 28:45.977
Thank you, Sam.

28:48.233 --> 28:49.445
Goodnight.

28:50.865 --> 28:52.077
Sam?

28:53.090 --> 28:54.808
Have you got a girlfriend?

28:55.177 --> 28:58.476
- I used to have.
- Where is she?

29:00.593 --> 29:03.278
A long long way away.

29:03.462 --> 29:04.828
In Mexico?

29:05.166 --> 29:07.207
Even further than that.

29:07.559 --> 29:10.183
She's probably
moved on now anyway.

29:12.194 --> 29:14.050
At least, I hope she has.

29:15.185 --> 29:17.242
Do you want to
come in with me?

29:20.526 --> 29:22.551
I'm a police officer.

29:23.779 --> 29:25.544
And you're in my care.

29:25.881 --> 29:27.738
Wouldn't bother the others.

29:29.472 --> 29:31.267
I'm not the others.

29:36.322 --> 29:41.264
It's a beautiful,
wonderful life, Joni.

29:41.801 --> 29:43.857
Too beautiful to waste...

29:43.996 --> 29:47.418
dancing in a rusty cage
for a man like that.

29:47.970 --> 29:49.428
I know.

29:51.622 --> 29:52.589
Sam?

29:53.295 --> 29:54.783
Go to sleep.

29:55.996 --> 29:57.868
I'm sorry for all the trouble.

29:59.157 --> 30:00.642
Go to sleep.

30:12.283 --> 30:13.404
<i>Sam?</i>

30:24.518 --> 30:26.129
<i>Can you hear me?</i>

30:27.755 --> 30:29.182
<i>It's Mum.</i>

30:30.026 --> 30:31.315
<i>Sam?</i>

30:31.714 --> 30:32.817
<i>Mum.</i>

30:34.229 --> 30:37.344
<i>Can you hear me?
Can you hear what I'm saying?</i>

30:53.745 --> 30:57.197
<i>There's nothing to be ashamed of, Sam.
You can't be lonely all the time.</i>

30:57.228 --> 30:59.791
<i>Sorry for all the trouble, Sam.</i>

31:00.036 --> 31:02.630
<i>It works very nicely,
thank you,</i>

31:02.722 --> 31:06.804
<i>til some dill from the suburbs
starts waving his willy around.</i>

31:07.142 --> 31:08.308
<i>Sam!</i>

31:10.973 --> 31:12.017
<i>Sam!</i>

31:17.771 --> 31:19.014
Shit!

31:25.583 --> 31:26.887
Morning.

31:27.793 --> 31:28.990
Piss off.

31:31.951 --> 31:34.406
WPC Cartwright...

31:35.081 --> 31:37.859
informed me that
you weren't answering your phone.

31:38.641 --> 31:40.222
He's in here, love.

31:52.653 --> 31:55.860
Well, it's not all golf and badminton
in Hyde then, eh?

32:00.801 --> 32:03.180
Had a few calls for you, sir.

32:03.747 --> 32:06.463
Told them you were all tied up.

32:08.642 --> 32:12.295
You did, er....
wash your hands, didn't you?

32:12.510 --> 32:14.228
Bad dreams, were they?

32:14.612 --> 32:17.926
- I've had better.
- Was Lucy there?

32:18.218 --> 32:20.474
Did she have
her diamond with her?

32:20.735 --> 32:21.794
What?

32:21.870 --> 32:25.891
Lysergic acid diethylamide.
LSD to you.

32:25.951 --> 32:28.898
Better be careful boss.
That stuff lasts for hours.

32:28.974 --> 32:31.782
Several pairs of handcuffs
missing from stores.

32:31.920 --> 32:33.792
Anyone any ideas?

32:33.854 --> 32:36.631
I asked you to look after
one of my detainees, sir.

32:36.769 --> 32:39.685
I don't recall asking you to sneak
her out through the back door,

32:39.731 --> 32:41.158
take her home
and sleep with her.

32:41.204 --> 32:42.248
It wasn't like that.

32:42.309 --> 32:45.701
Go easy on him, Phyllis. He's just taken
a stroll down the yellow brick road!

32:45.808 --> 32:48.785
Where is she now? She was arrested
for causing criminal damage.

32:48.893 --> 32:50.151
I don't know.

32:51.401 --> 32:54.332
<i>His brain functions
and heart rate are all up.</i>

32:54.747 --> 32:55.898
<i>Racing.</i>

32:56.419 --> 33:00.302
<i>It's what we'd expect from a change
of medication to pentobarbital.</i>

33:00.378 --> 33:04.169
<i>Still, nothing ventured,
nothing gained.</i>

33:06.554 --> 33:08.702
Do you know
who she works for?

33:12.431 --> 33:14.749
- What?
- The girl.

33:14.948 --> 33:17.234
Do you know
who she works for?

33:18.344 --> 33:21.781
Yeah. But that's why
she came to see me.

33:22.395 --> 33:25.479
Don't be a prick, Sam,
and don't you go rocking the boat.

33:25.587 --> 33:28.456
- She's terrified of him.
- So what?

33:28.978 --> 33:31.878
He threatened to rape her
and then kill her.

33:32.001 --> 33:32.967
Sorry, you what?

33:33.059 --> 33:35.407
He threatened to rape her
and then kill her.

33:38.154 --> 33:40.760
Oh, yeah, I'm glad
you find it so amusing.

33:41.067 --> 33:44.382
You know, I was the only officer
in here who she trusted enough

33:44.443 --> 33:47.758
not to hand her over to Warren,
so how funny's that?!

33:49.200 --> 33:51.441
A word. Now.

33:57.640 --> 34:00.694
Don't you bloody dare come
as self-righteous prick with me!

34:00.817 --> 34:02.780
I've been working these streets
since I was 19

34:02.857 --> 34:05.527
and they're safer now
than they've been in a generation.

34:05.604 --> 34:07.798
Now, if you wanna shag
the inmates, that's up to you,

34:07.829 --> 34:11.219
but don't you dare
chuck shit at me and my officers.

34:11.282 --> 34:13.092
We're not talking
about a dodgy telly.

34:13.154 --> 34:16.944
We're talking about threats
of sexual violence and murder.

34:17.097 --> 34:21.210
- You think you know everything.
- I know the stench of rotten apples.

34:21.393 --> 34:24.447
And I know your slag is lying through
her teeth, you wanna know why?

34:24.556 --> 34:25.799
Yeah. Why?

34:25.983 --> 34:28.561
Stephen Warren is a bum-bandit.

34:29.098 --> 34:30.694
Do you understand?

34:30.755 --> 34:33.549
A poof. A fairy.

34:33.610 --> 34:35.942
A queer. A queen.

34:36.018 --> 34:40.868
Fudge-packer. Uphill gardener.
Fruit-picking sodomite!

34:41.206 --> 34:44.643
- He's gay?
- As a bloody Christmas tree!

34:46.224 --> 34:48.433
Mind you, he is a little
touchy on the subject,

34:48.480 --> 34:50.842
being a twisted Catholic
with an elderly mother at home,

34:50.889 --> 34:52.976
so I wouldn't go
mentioning it to him.

34:54.878 --> 34:58.684
You challenged his authority, so
he stitched like you up like a kipper.

34:58.914 --> 35:03.149
Pretty girl appealed to your vanity as
the only decent sheriff in Dodge City.

35:03.241 --> 35:05.297
Slipped you a mickey,
tied you up,

35:05.359 --> 35:07.415
and bounced
on your ding-a-ling.

35:07.477 --> 35:08.428
Why?

35:08.934 --> 35:11.113
Well, I suspect the answer
will lie in the post.

35:11.189 --> 35:13.046
Photos, you idiot.

35:13.307 --> 35:16.192
So, next time he asks you
a little favour, I suggest you do it.

35:16.253 --> 35:19.476
Otherwise your pictures will be landing
on the desk of the Chief Constable.

35:19.537 --> 35:21.885
And he gets a Christmas card
from Mary Whitehouse.

35:21.961 --> 35:22.928
And believe you me,

35:22.990 --> 35:25.813
you'll be out of here in the time
it takes to say Red bloody Rum.

35:26.105 --> 35:28.514
- She was a honeytrap.
- Bingo.

35:31.291 --> 35:35.066
You're not the first,
and you won't be the last.

35:40.330 --> 35:42.245
Checks and balances, Sam.

35:42.293 --> 35:44.723
You can't come into our manor
throwing your weight around

35:44.754 --> 35:46.530
and expect to get away with it.

36:08.361 --> 36:09.877
Do you mind if I sit down?

36:12.910 --> 36:14.387
'Course not, sir.

36:23.452 --> 36:27.749
Look, I'm... sorry you had
to see what you saw, before.

36:28.472 --> 36:30.043
Don't flatter yourself.

36:30.679 --> 36:32.290
There wasn't that much to see.

36:37.244 --> 36:39.742
Okay. Mean Streets or...

36:40.025 --> 36:42.688
Carry on Girls?
You choose, I'll pay.

36:43.914 --> 36:45.218
I don't think so.

36:46.959 --> 36:48.538
I can explain everything.

36:48.624 --> 36:50.573
You don't have
to explain anything to me.

36:50.636 --> 36:51.343
Annie.

36:51.610 --> 36:53.213
I've decided something.

36:53.448 --> 36:54.870
What have you decided?

36:56.528 --> 36:58.893
I'm going to be
a really good friend to you.

37:01.504 --> 37:02.439
A friend.

37:02.509 --> 37:04.207
'Cause with the enemies
you're making,

37:04.254 --> 37:06.179
you could do with all
the friends you can get.

37:07.829 --> 37:10.806
Look after yourself,
Detective Inspector Tyler.

37:13.006 --> 37:13.737
Please.

37:27.305 --> 37:28.562
Annie, please...

37:28.852 --> 37:29.489
Hey.

37:30.479 --> 37:32.058
I got to see you naked.

37:32.632 --> 37:33.952
It's not all that bad.

37:58.006 --> 37:58.949
Give us a minute.

38:02.365 --> 38:03.504
What do you want?

38:03.802 --> 38:05.798
You're a real class act,
aren't you?

38:05.900 --> 38:07.471
I do what I have to do.

38:07.629 --> 38:09.004
Where are the photographs?

38:09.082 --> 38:10.394
Being developed.

38:10.559 --> 38:12.028
Please help me.

38:12.555 --> 38:15.092
I'm sorry.
I was just doing a job.

38:15.186 --> 38:17.653
You have
a real talent for lying.

38:17.716 --> 38:19.044
Some of it was true.

38:19.303 --> 38:21.440
This is a dangerous place
for you, Sam,

38:21.542 --> 38:22.729
and you shouldn't be here.

38:22.792 --> 38:25.471
Are you lying to yourself, though?
That's the question.

38:25.565 --> 38:26.767
Think what you want.

38:31.088 --> 38:33.414
You're a loser, Joni.

38:33.970 --> 38:35.581
Or whatever your name is.

38:35.715 --> 38:37.530
Because you live in fear.

38:38.088 --> 38:40.570
And that isn't really
living at all, is it?

38:41.199 --> 38:43.171
Now I don't live in fear.

38:43.956 --> 38:45.119
I'm alive.

38:58.139 --> 38:59.648
He had it coming to him.

39:00.842 --> 39:03.616
You do not humiliate my officers.

39:03.670 --> 39:06.907
If you can't keep your people
in line, I'll do it for you.

39:06.963 --> 39:09.241
I'm the sheriff, Warren,
don't you ever forget it!

39:09.359 --> 39:12.077
No, Mr Hunt!
You're a bent sheriff!

39:12.155 --> 39:14.080
Don't you ever forget that!

39:30.312 --> 39:31.570
Mrs Tyler.

39:32.222 --> 39:33.141
The money.

39:33.697 --> 39:37.178
It must have appeared
crass and insensitive to you, and...

39:37.414 --> 39:38.702
I don't think I am.

39:38.890 --> 39:40.202
I know I'm not.

39:40.352 --> 39:41.711
You don't think you're what?

39:42.166 --> 39:43.997
Crass and insensitive.

39:45.888 --> 39:48.708
You must have thought
it was dodgy. Hot.

39:49.251 --> 39:49.997
It wasn't.

39:50.139 --> 39:52.842
Well, it was a little bit,
but I gave it back.

39:53.101 --> 39:53.941
All of it.

39:55.002 --> 39:56.534
That's good then.

39:56.793 --> 40:00.211
I just wanted you to know
that I am not a bent copper.

40:01.399 --> 40:03.057
Well, now I know.

40:10.029 --> 40:10.956
How is he?

40:11.239 --> 40:12.810
He's much better, thank you.

40:18.019 --> 40:19.158
I'd better be going.

40:19.315 --> 40:20.847
Naughty men to arrest.

40:21.389 --> 40:22.615
That's right.

40:25.189 --> 40:26.493
Goodbye, Mrs Tyler.

40:27.381 --> 40:29.046
Goodbye, Inspector Bolan.

40:32.163 --> 40:33.208
Inspector.

40:35.439 --> 40:38.275
I'm going to buy him
a treacle tart tomorrow.

40:38.323 --> 40:39.957
His favourite.

40:40.161 --> 40:42.204
For being such a brave boy
with the mumps.

40:42.668 --> 40:43.783
With custard?

40:44.192 --> 40:45.425
With custard.

40:45.582 --> 40:47.491
Leave the skin on?

40:49.455 --> 40:52.048
You'd be very welcome
to drop in,

40:52.118 --> 40:53.894
if you were passing. He'd...

40:54.303 --> 40:57.367
He'd really love to meet
a real life police officer.

41:01.147 --> 41:01.901
Thanks.

41:12.672 --> 41:15.248
Come on, Red Rum!
Come on, my son!

41:17.811 --> 41:21.291
Are those... brackets,
really gonna hold our television?

41:21.912 --> 41:25.605
'Course they'll hold. I worked
in a DIY store in my gap year.

41:26.100 --> 41:27.515
Your what year?

41:29.177 --> 41:30.606
The brackets will hold.

41:36.428 --> 41:37.835
How were the chilis?

41:38.448 --> 41:39.084
Good.

41:39.351 --> 41:40.153
Strong.

41:40.270 --> 41:42.242
Bit too strong, I hear.

41:50.639 --> 41:52.186
Anything in the post yet?

41:53.106 --> 41:54.111
Not yet.

41:55.817 --> 41:58.716
Probably having to blow it up
so they can actually see something, eh?

42:02.324 --> 42:03.416
Get on, my son.

42:03.487 --> 42:06.277
Mr Tyler,
someone out back to see you.

42:06.685 --> 42:07.565
Who is it?

42:17.596 --> 42:20.408
Delivering the photographs yourself?
Very classy.

42:20.478 --> 42:21.932
There are no photographs.

42:22.010 --> 42:23.581
And I've got the negatives.

42:23.715 --> 42:25.286
You expect me to believe that?

42:36.822 --> 42:39.030
Even if it's true,
why would you do that?

42:39.533 --> 42:41.591
Couldn't stop thinking
about what you'd said.

42:42.660 --> 42:44.397
It <i>is</i> a beautiful life.

42:45.112 --> 42:46.840
Least, it should be, anyway.

42:47.901 --> 42:51.091
You know, you asked me why I started
working for a man like Warren.

42:51.365 --> 42:52.874
Money, I think you said.

42:54.029 --> 42:57.258
My mum and dad used to own
a successful cash-and-carry business,

42:57.306 --> 42:59.348
until Warren decided he wanted it.

42:59.576 --> 43:01.485
And then he said my dad
had fiddled the books

43:01.548 --> 43:03.096
and he was going
to go to the police.

43:03.136 --> 43:05.108
And the police,
as you know, are his friends.

43:05.178 --> 43:06.060
You set me up.

43:06.318 --> 43:08.065
I don't believe a word you're saying.

43:08.109 --> 43:09.184
Yeah you do.

43:09.583 --> 43:12.977
My dad's dead.
They said cancer, but...

43:14.741 --> 43:16.646
Then Warren turned on
my mum and me.

43:17.162 --> 43:20.273
He said if I danced at his club,
and was nice to some of his friends-

43:20.292 --> 43:24.276
- If you're spinning me another line-
- Setting you up was my last job.

43:24.383 --> 43:27.387
He said if I did that,
he'd let me go.

43:28.133 --> 43:29.960
But he never will, will he?

43:30.392 --> 43:32.061
He was lying to me,

43:32.336 --> 43:34.153
and I was lying to myself.

43:39.015 --> 43:40.891
I can nail him.

43:41.009 --> 43:42.973
But I need ammunition from you.

43:43.101 --> 43:44.957
Are you willing
to testify against him?

43:45.007 --> 43:46.598
Don't stand up to him, Sam.

43:46.960 --> 43:48.129
He'll have you.

43:50.870 --> 43:52.314
What will you do?

43:52.381 --> 43:54.513
Me and mum
are going on a trip.

43:54.709 --> 43:57.135
A long way away
from people like him.

43:57.301 --> 44:00.189
- Where're you gonna go?
- I don't know.

44:02.241 --> 44:04.343
I hear Mexico's nice.

44:22.613 --> 44:24.155
Red Rum, you beauty!

44:26.885 --> 44:29.125
Proud Percy fell
at Becher's Brook, boss.

44:29.203 --> 44:30.656
They had to shoot him.

44:31.530 --> 44:32.650
Too bad.

44:45.301 --> 44:47.769
- Who is it?
- <i>It's me.</i>

44:56.695 --> 44:59.740
I'm not cuffed to the bed.
Sorry to disappoint you.

44:59.826 --> 45:01.053
Get your coat.

45:01.606 --> 45:04.245
- What time is it?
- Just get your coat.

46:01.009 --> 46:03.600
He might as well have
slit her throat himself.

46:08.408 --> 46:09.894
What did you say?

46:15.825 --> 46:17.494
What did you say?

46:20.195 --> 46:21.226
Nothing.

46:21.577 --> 46:23.614
Be a brave boy
and tell me what you said.

46:24.066 --> 46:26.794
If he's got something to say,
I want to hear it.

46:28.777 --> 46:32.536
If you don't play the game,
people get hurt.

46:32.951 --> 46:35.267
<i>You</i> didn't play the game

46:35.497 --> 46:37.569
and <i>she</i> payed the price.

47:12.398 --> 47:14.501
First job I ever had in the Force,

47:14.561 --> 47:17.517
pounding the streets
as a nineteen-year-old flatfoot.

47:17.728 --> 47:20.521
I was teamed with this bloke
called Harry Althway.

47:21.236 --> 47:25.653
Fought on the beaches in Normandy,
won a medal. Never talked about it.

47:26.611 --> 47:28.088
You know the sort.

47:28.868 --> 47:31.726
Breath that could
strip the fur off a badger.

47:32.619 --> 47:35.704
Never did his paperwork,
but he was a legend, was Harry.

47:38.481 --> 47:41.924
And there was this gangster
knocking round town in them days.

47:42.216 --> 47:44.522
Made a lot of money
during the war.

47:45.610 --> 47:48.728
Had a lot of coppers
and politicians in his pocket.

47:49.637 --> 47:51.423
"Plus ça change..."

47:51.602 --> 47:52.495
What?

47:53.047 --> 47:54.005
Go on.

47:54.541 --> 47:58.649
I found out Harry was taking the odd
backhander to look the other way.

47:59.412 --> 48:00.987
What did you do?

48:01.150 --> 48:04.377
I did what any other shiny
new kid on the block would do.

48:04.803 --> 48:06.387
Shopped him.

48:07.807 --> 48:10.771
Everyone hated me for squealing.

48:11.258 --> 48:13.308
You did the right thing.

48:13.430 --> 48:17.327
Harry couldn't handle it. Ended up
hanging himself with his own belt.

48:17.632 --> 48:20.656
Month later,
I took my first backhander.

48:21.874 --> 48:24.452
How did that make you feel?

48:24.797 --> 48:26.563
Like shit.

48:26.807 --> 48:28.634
How does it make you feel now?

48:28.674 --> 48:30.826
You know,
I try not to think about it.

48:32.389 --> 48:34.642
Do the best that I can.

48:35.433 --> 48:40.061
Try and look after my men
and the people in my city.

48:40.305 --> 48:42.842
But when you do think about it?

48:44.548 --> 48:46.760
How does it make you feel?

48:47.613 --> 48:51.002
Like there's an animal
eating away at my insides.

48:52.037 --> 48:54.656
Fancy doing something about it?

48:55.143 --> 48:57.051
I thought you'd never ask.

49:07.954 --> 49:11.020
He'll have you both for this.

49:11.072 --> 49:13.111
My friend is gonna ask you
some questions.

49:13.137 --> 49:14.852
Personally,
I hope you don't answer them,

49:14.917 --> 49:18.178
because I want you to die in here
and end up inside a pork pie.

49:18.659 --> 49:21.348
Who killed Joni Newton?

49:24.562 --> 49:25.705
Trousers.

49:25.783 --> 49:28.784
- Please...
- Don't talk to me! Trousers!

49:35.121 --> 49:37.043
Who killed Joni Newton?

49:41.199 --> 49:43.433
Right. Leave him in here.

49:44.160 --> 49:46.044
Are you gonna answer
my question?

49:47.850 --> 49:49.513
Yeah. Let's go.

49:50.994 --> 49:53.176
Ah ah ah. Leave them.

49:53.410 --> 49:56.489
I can't tell you, he'll kill me!

49:56.644 --> 49:58.735
At least it would've been
a warm death.

50:03.738 --> 50:05.700
<i>What the hell are you doing?</i>

50:07.739 --> 50:10.636
<i>Open the door! You can't go through
with this! Let me out!</i>

50:10.675 --> 50:12.910
How did you know
Red Rum was gonna win the National?

50:13.040 --> 50:14.833
<i>I'm gonna die in here!</i>

50:14.975 --> 50:16.625
It was just a hunch.

50:18.676 --> 50:20.755
<i>Let me out, please!</i>

50:21.573 --> 50:24.976
You didn't have any...
inside information?

50:25.288 --> 50:27.263
Little bird
in the racing fraternity?

50:27.315 --> 50:30.160
- <i>Can you hear me?</i>
- I wouldn't do that, would I?

50:30.549 --> 50:33.978
Well, I didn't think you'd lock
a murder suspect in a giant fridge.

50:34.108 --> 50:36.173
He wouldn't answer my question.

50:37.394 --> 50:39.239
I've got a feeling he will.

50:40.083 --> 50:42.682
<i>Just let me out, please!</i>

50:43.669 --> 50:46.514
How's that little animal,
in your stomach?

50:47.397 --> 50:49.267
Do you know,
I do believe he's sleeping.

50:49.371 --> 50:52.671
<i>Open! Alright!
Alright, I'll talk!</i>

51:01.685 --> 51:03.803
Who killed Joni Newton?

51:05.557 --> 51:09.194
She was supposed to be
your honeytrap.

51:09.402 --> 51:13.078
When she didn't come through,
Warren went ballistic. Slit her throat.

51:15.285 --> 51:16.753
Then put her in the canal.

51:19.377 --> 51:21.157
Job to do, Sam, huh?

51:30.104 --> 51:31.507
Do you like this music?

51:32.442 --> 51:34.508
Yeah, I do. Don't you?

51:34.820 --> 51:36.794
Just a lot of noise, really.

51:37.782 --> 51:40.860
Me and the wife like
Roger Whittaker.

51:42.159 --> 51:44.198
Well, not - more her than me.

51:44.237 --> 51:45.549
Do you know him?

51:46.043 --> 51:47.693
Not intimately.

51:49.160 --> 51:50.732
Keep it to yourself.

51:50.902 --> 51:53.214
We all have
our guilty little secrets..

51:53.656 --> 51:55.487
Indeed we do.

52:01.268 --> 52:03.074
I'm not a Catholic myself,
Mr Warren,

52:03.112 --> 52:06.165
but isn't there something about
"Thou shalt not suck off rent boys"?

52:06.243 --> 52:08.152
How dare you come in here!

52:08.282 --> 52:09.893
You could've said that to the boy.

52:09.971 --> 52:13.829
Stephen Warren, I'm arresting you on
suspicion of the murder of Joni Newton.

52:13.985 --> 52:16.999
You can't touch me, son!
I own you.

52:17.090 --> 52:19.000
You do not have
to say anything,

52:19.065 --> 52:22.403
but it may harm your defence
if you do not mention something...

52:22.442 --> 52:26.131
- which you may later rely on in court.
- That's not how it goes!

52:26.248 --> 52:28.664
One call, and I'm out again.

52:28.742 --> 52:31.704
And your life, Mr Hunt,
won't be worth living.

52:31.782 --> 52:32.951
Shut up, Wendy Warren.

52:33.015 --> 52:35.081
Get your handbag
and let's be having you.

52:36.705 --> 52:38.407
Now what would you prefer?

52:38.538 --> 52:41.980
Out the front, cuffed,
humiliated in front of your punters?

52:42.058 --> 52:44.267
Or nice and quiet
out the back?

52:44.423 --> 52:46.112
Out the back.

52:46.514 --> 52:47.891
That's what I thought.

53:36.931 --> 53:37.906
Thank you.

53:43.943 --> 53:45.943
Well, come on then,
get us a drink in.

53:47.996 --> 53:50.918
There's no way
you can police a modern city

53:50.943 --> 53:52.697
without a bit of give and take.

53:52.794 --> 53:54.694
Checks and balances.

53:56.138 --> 53:58.022
It can't work like that.

53:58.379 --> 54:01.091
Every copper
has to be whiter than white,

54:01.139 --> 54:02.698
or the whole thing falls apart.

54:02.763 --> 54:04.468
You're living
in Cloud Cuckoo Land, Sam.

54:04.516 --> 54:07.277
Otherwise it spreads like a cancer.

54:07.337 --> 54:09.457
A free cut of meat
from the butcher at Christmas.

54:09.477 --> 54:12.491
You wave the paperwork through
for a fella with a funny handshake

54:12.585 --> 54:14.268
and then one morning,
you wake up,

54:14.475 --> 54:17.447
and your whole body's riddled with it
and you haven't even noticed.

54:17.509 --> 54:19.979
You're a cheerful bastard
to have a drink with, aren't you?

54:20.028 --> 54:22.739
Come on,
we're meant to be celebrating.

54:25.245 --> 54:26.814
You did well, Sam.

54:27.084 --> 54:30.888
Every officer will be walking a little
bit taller tomorrow because of you.

54:49.878 --> 54:50.803
Hello?

55:05.160 --> 55:05.971
Hello?

56:48.239 --> 56:50.941
<i>Sleep well, darling.
Mum's here.</i>

56:51.097 --> 56:52.728
<i>We'll always be here.</i>

56:52.959 --> 56:56.645
<i>One day, you'll wake up
and I'll still be here.</i>

56:56.727 --> 56:58.432
<i>I love you.</i>
