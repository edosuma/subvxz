WEBVTT

00:04.372 --> 00:05.505
Annie, two gifts?

00:05.556 --> 00:06.839
Thank you.

00:06.891 --> 00:08.475
Well, I wanted to get
the baby a doll

00:08.543 --> 00:10.943
and since the father
might be Andre or Chang,

00:11.012 --> 00:13.196
I wanted all
ethnic bases covered.

00:13.281 --> 00:16.416
So there's a little
African-American girl.

00:19.387 --> 00:22.289
And there's a very nice letter
from the manufacturer

00:22.356 --> 00:24.124
promising to expand
their selection.

00:24.191 --> 00:26.026
Oh, is everyone
enjoying their egg rolls

00:26.093 --> 00:27.827
and/or Mieliepap.

00:27.895 --> 00:30.764
A traditional maize porridge
popular in Ghana?

00:30.831 --> 00:33.133
Annie, you are aware that baby
showers can be race neutral.

00:33.200 --> 00:35.635
Yes, thank you, Annie,
for trying to be inclusive,

00:35.703 --> 00:39.723
but, um, regardless
of any biological happenstance,

00:39.807 --> 00:41.758
this baby will be raised
by Andre and I.

00:41.842 --> 00:44.511
That's right.
And I seem to recall a story

00:44.579 --> 00:46.012
about a man named Joseph

00:46.080 --> 00:48.014
who happily raised a baby
that wasn't his.

00:48.082 --> 00:50.917
History's greatest chump.

00:50.985 --> 00:53.053
We're talking
about Joe Kennedy, right?

00:53.120 --> 00:55.438
It's cool. If it's mine,
I'll be a lovable uncle.

00:55.523 --> 00:58.191
Okay, a creepy uncle.
Final offer.

00:58.259 --> 01:00.393
This is from me and Troy.

01:00.461 --> 01:01.828
When your child
is a lone scavenger

01:01.895 --> 01:03.129
in the nuclear wasteland,

01:03.197 --> 01:04.730
clean water will be worth
its weight in gold.

01:04.782 --> 01:06.899
Yeah, we wanted to get him
a sawed-off shotgun,

01:06.951 --> 01:09.736
but those are pretty
expensive already.

01:09.804 --> 01:11.371
Sorry.
You people eat this stuff?

01:11.439 --> 01:13.106
I've never seen
that stuff in my life.

01:13.174 --> 01:15.442
You know, you really
shouldn't say "you people."

01:15.509 --> 01:16.443
Oh, it's okay.

01:16.510 --> 01:17.611
Pierce was having trouble

01:17.678 --> 01:19.212
quitting offensive phrases
cold Turkey,

01:19.280 --> 01:20.747
so we've created
a bargaining system.

01:20.815 --> 01:23.783
We traded "you people" for some
of his other favorite phrases.

01:23.851 --> 01:27.220
Yeah, I really got...
Jewish-personed out of that one.

01:27.288 --> 01:30.140
- Here, open mine.
- Thank you.

01:33.494 --> 01:35.829
Oh, a cigar cutter,

01:35.896 --> 01:38.264
"Max" magazine, and hot sauce.

01:38.332 --> 01:39.265
It's a theme gift.

01:39.333 --> 01:40.567
Yeah, I believe the theme is

01:40.635 --> 01:42.102
"stuff lying around
my apartment."

01:42.169 --> 01:43.436
Sorry I'm late.

01:43.504 --> 01:45.989
Can I get a <i>ni hao</i>
up in this hizzy?

01:46.073 --> 01:48.458
Why is everyone in this school
obsessed with race?

01:48.542 --> 01:50.744
White-people problems.

01:50.811 --> 01:53.246
Ooh, that looks fun.

01:53.314 --> 01:55.548
Oh, Troy, Abed,
who was that cute guy

01:55.616 --> 01:57.350
that I saw you
outside with earlier?

01:57.418 --> 01:58.952
Oh, that's Lukka.
That's our new friend.

01:59.020 --> 02:01.087
- He's in Troy's history class.
- Oh, yeah, he's awesome.

02:01.155 --> 02:02.756
He has an accent.
He rolls his own cigarettes.

02:02.823 --> 02:04.357
And he plays
the same video games as us.

02:04.425 --> 02:05.458
We like him a lot.

02:05.526 --> 02:08.294
So you're not allowed
to bone him.

02:08.362 --> 02:10.096
You just guaranteed
she'll bone him.

02:10.163 --> 02:12.432
Mmm. Mmm. Mmm.

02:12.483 --> 02:14.484
Mmm.
Ugh, who am I kidding?

02:14.568 --> 02:16.770
I should be putting this
right on my thighs.

02:18.000 --> 02:24.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:44.048 --> 02:45.699
Watch out, Abed.
There's a guy on your six.

02:45.766 --> 02:47.517
That's why I'm taking out
my nine millimeter.

02:47.601 --> 02:48.635
Please.

02:48.703 --> 02:50.103
In my country,
we give nine millimeter

02:50.170 --> 02:51.905
to little girl for sweet 16.

02:51.972 --> 02:53.840
- Try grenade launcher.
- Cool.

02:56.377 --> 02:58.678
Easy peasy, lemon squeezy.

02:58.729 --> 03:00.547
Knock, knock.

03:00.614 --> 03:02.382
Hey, I was just stopping by.

03:02.450 --> 03:04.217
Oh, is this a bad time?

03:04.285 --> 03:05.218
Yeah.

03:05.286 --> 03:06.386
Gentlemen, it's no way

03:06.454 --> 03:08.254
to treat a girl
that looks this way.

03:08.322 --> 03:09.289
Come in.

03:09.356 --> 03:11.074
- I'm Lukka.
- Britta.

03:11.158 --> 03:12.492
Like, uh, Britney Spears.

03:12.543 --> 03:14.411
Exactly like Britney Spears.

03:20.584 --> 03:22.268
Britta was just leaving.

03:22.336 --> 03:23.586
No, no, no, stay.

03:23.671 --> 03:25.872
Visit with your friends.
I must go anyway.

03:25.940 --> 03:28.174
- Oh!
- Yes, I'm cooking <i>Podvarak.</i>

03:28.225 --> 03:30.276
- Oh, I've never had that.
- I could make for you.

03:30.344 --> 03:32.262
Okay, I'll give you my number.

03:32.346 --> 03:34.848
You are her boyfriends?

03:36.050 --> 03:37.517
I love these guys.

03:37.585 --> 03:39.569
They make funny
with their mouths.

03:39.653 --> 03:41.187
Here you go.

03:41.255 --> 03:44.057
- I leave.
- Okay.

03:44.125 --> 03:45.158
What?

03:45.226 --> 03:47.026
- He asked me out.
- You're not allowed.

03:47.094 --> 03:48.428
- Not allowed?
- You'll ruin him.

03:48.496 --> 03:49.763
- I'll ruin him?
- Stop repeating.

03:49.830 --> 03:51.414
Stop rep...rimanding me,

03:51.499 --> 03:52.766
and explain why I'll ruin him.

03:52.833 --> 03:54.801
Britta, you date guys
that we think are cool,

03:54.869 --> 03:56.703
and when you decide
you don't like them anymore,

03:56.771 --> 03:58.037
you tell us
horrible things about them

03:58.105 --> 03:59.038
that we can never unhear.

03:59.106 --> 04:00.240
Name one guy I did that with.

04:00.307 --> 04:03.109
- That one dude, tall Kyle.
- Jeff.

04:03.177 --> 04:04.611
Jeff?
I ruined Jeff?

04:04.678 --> 04:06.546
Oh, you mean
Jeff "nipple play" winger?

04:06.597 --> 04:08.581
No, as you can see, we're still
hanging out with him.

04:08.649 --> 04:10.116
How's it going, Jeff?

04:10.184 --> 04:11.384
Promise me
you won't date Lukka,

04:11.435 --> 04:12.752
and I'll give you one of these.

04:12.803 --> 04:14.637
It's a sweatshirt I made

04:14.722 --> 04:16.623
for everyone who was part of the
paintball adventure last year.

04:16.690 --> 04:17.991
You should have given me

04:18.058 --> 04:19.591
one of those a long time ago.
I kicked your asses.

04:23.197 --> 04:25.982
Don't date Lukka.

04:26.066 --> 04:27.667
"Hit my genie bottle"?

04:27.735 --> 04:30.603
What the... what was that?

04:30.654 --> 04:31.988
Ooh, ooh, Jeff, Jeff,

04:32.072 --> 04:33.990
I was, um, hoping
you can help me with something?

04:34.074 --> 04:36.242
Sure.
Let's have a look here.

04:36.310 --> 04:37.994
Let's see, uh, pieces of paper,

04:38.078 --> 04:39.579
stapled together,
lot of writing.

04:39.647 --> 04:41.080
I'm afraid this is
as far as I can go.

04:41.132 --> 04:42.916
No, no, no, I don't want
you to read it, Jeff.

04:42.983 --> 04:44.751
I want you to help me
get Chang to sign it.

04:44.802 --> 04:46.052
It's a little
something-something

04:46.120 --> 04:47.170
I had an attorney draw up.

04:47.254 --> 04:48.454
This little
something-something

04:48.522 --> 04:50.023
is a forfeiture
of parental rights.

04:50.090 --> 04:51.891
Mm-hmm.
Better safe than sorry.

04:51.959 --> 04:53.359
Why do you need me
to make Chang

04:53.427 --> 04:54.477
sign away
his hypothetical baby?

04:54.562 --> 04:56.295
Isn't he sort of
living with you?

04:56.347 --> 04:58.181
- Not cool, Shirley.
- You have a rapport with him...

04:58.265 --> 04:59.532
Not cool, Shirley.

04:59.600 --> 05:01.518
Besides, as your friend,
can I tell you,

05:01.602 --> 05:02.969
don't poke that bear.

05:03.037 --> 05:04.354
I mean, I think right now

05:04.438 --> 05:06.272
you're as protected
as you can get.

05:06.323 --> 05:07.740
I don't see Chang as being

05:07.808 --> 05:08.942
a real hands-on
baby daddy.

05:09.009 --> 05:11.027
Oh, so now we're all
in the business

05:11.111 --> 05:13.413
of knowing what's going on
in Chang's head, huh?

05:13.480 --> 05:14.697
Huh?

05:19.503 --> 05:21.320
Fine.
For the child.

05:21.372 --> 05:23.039
- God bless you.
- Not lately.

05:27.995 --> 05:30.847
Oh, I'm, um...
Oh, I'm so sorry,

05:30.931 --> 05:34.267
but could you just
not tell Troy and Abed

05:34.334 --> 05:35.535
that we went out tonight?

05:35.603 --> 05:37.170
No problem.

05:37.238 --> 05:39.239
It's just, um...
They're just really worried

05:39.306 --> 05:41.741
if you and I,
you know, see each other

05:41.809 --> 05:44.343
that it's somehow gonna affect
your friendship with them.

05:44.395 --> 05:46.312
Hey, don't worry.
Don't worry.

05:46.380 --> 05:48.514
I can keep a secret.

05:48.582 --> 05:49.949
I'm from the Balkans.

05:50.017 --> 05:52.252
There are many things
I try not to talk about.

05:54.355 --> 05:55.855
Lukka...

05:55.923 --> 05:57.390
I knew it.

05:57.458 --> 06:00.026
I knew there was pain in there.

06:00.094 --> 06:01.360
Just so you know,

06:01.412 --> 06:03.229
you can talk to me
about anything.

06:05.366 --> 06:07.567
So much killing...

06:07.635 --> 06:11.204
The corpses
stacked like firewood,

06:11.272 --> 06:13.439
the rivers red
with their blood...

06:13.507 --> 06:15.041
I miss it so much.

06:15.092 --> 06:17.277
Oh, Lukka.

06:17.344 --> 06:19.896
Mm. Wait, just, um...
Just to clarify,

06:19.980 --> 06:21.380
when you say you miss it,

06:21.432 --> 06:23.549
it's like... like you have
survivor's guilt,

06:23.617 --> 06:25.435
like you wish you were
back over there

06:25.519 --> 06:26.786
defending
the motherland, right?

06:26.854 --> 06:29.722
Yes, I-I miss cleansing
our fields and forests

06:29.790 --> 06:31.791
of the unclean people
who stole my country.

06:31.859 --> 06:35.762
I miss the smell
of the villages burning.

06:37.164 --> 06:41.401
I miss the way they used to run
from our tanks in fear.

06:43.337 --> 06:44.771
Ah, damn it.

06:44.838 --> 06:47.123
My neighbor is jazz musician.

06:47.207 --> 06:48.775
Hey, Spencer, come on, man.

06:48.842 --> 06:50.543
I got woman in here!

06:52.179 --> 06:53.212
Great.

06:53.280 --> 06:54.914
He really knows
how to kill the mood.

07:00.638 --> 07:02.889
What are you doing?
Did you look for a job today?

07:02.957 --> 07:04.123
I was going to,

07:04.191 --> 07:05.942
but I noticed
your coffee table's wobbly,

07:06.026 --> 07:08.695
so I decided to fix it.

07:08.762 --> 07:10.897
Ugh!

07:10.965 --> 07:13.733
It must be the floor.

07:13.801 --> 07:15.868
Don't saw the floor.
Don't saw anything.

07:15.936 --> 07:19.122
I'm tired of confiscating saws.
Give me that.

07:19.206 --> 07:23.076
Take this.

07:23.127 --> 07:25.244
"Parental rights"?

07:25.312 --> 07:27.747
- You're adopting me?
- It's from Shirley.

07:27.815 --> 07:29.582
It gives her
and Andre the baby.

07:29.650 --> 07:31.451
Sign it.

07:31.518 --> 07:33.086
Oh, and if anyone asks,

07:33.137 --> 07:35.388
this was my most convincing
speech ever.

07:41.428 --> 07:44.514
Why are you crying?

07:44.598 --> 07:45.865
Ugh.

07:45.933 --> 07:48.434
Don't tell me you actually
wanted to be a father.

07:48.485 --> 07:50.837
I don't know.

07:50.904 --> 07:52.689
Maybe.

07:52.773 --> 07:55.441
I mean, what if this
is my last chance?

07:55.509 --> 07:58.544
I mean, between you and me,
I don't Chang a lot of chicks.

07:58.612 --> 08:01.381
But fathers are responsible.
They have jobs.

08:01.448 --> 08:03.583
You, you crash
on people's couches

08:03.650 --> 08:05.885
and twitch in your sleep
like a dog dreaming of a rabbit.

08:05.953 --> 08:07.754
It's real!
You don't...

08:07.821 --> 08:09.889
Wait.

08:09.957 --> 08:14.794
So you're saying if I get a job
and my own apartment,

08:14.862 --> 08:18.831
Shirley might let me be part
of my baby's life?

08:21.602 --> 08:23.736
Yes.

08:23.804 --> 08:27.106
That's exactly what I'm saying.

08:27.174 --> 08:29.575
- So does that mean I can...?
- Go for it.

08:31.478 --> 08:33.511
Where do you keep
getting these?

08:38.994 --> 08:40.528
Hey, guys, where are you going?

08:40.578 --> 08:41.828
We're grabbing lunch

08:41.895 --> 08:43.364
for a marathon video game
session with Lukka.

08:43.414 --> 08:45.866
Lots of fork foods... don't want
to grease up the troops.

08:45.934 --> 08:47.785
Oh, speaking of Lukka,

08:47.869 --> 08:50.037
how much do you guys know
about him, anyway?

08:50.105 --> 08:51.472
- Why?
- Did you start dating him,

08:51.540 --> 08:53.574
and now you want to tell us
horrible things about him?

08:53.642 --> 08:55.276
What? No.

08:55.343 --> 08:57.078
Good, 'cause Lukka's gonna
teach us how to break the will

08:57.145 --> 08:58.612
of an entire village
by killing their livestock

08:58.680 --> 08:59.964
and desecrating
their places of worship.

09:00.048 --> 09:01.081
That sounds horrific.

09:01.133 --> 09:03.117
Ugh. Girls are
so un-desensitized.

09:07.389 --> 09:10.224
Jeffrey.

09:10.292 --> 09:11.792
- Hey, guys.
- Hey, man.

09:11.860 --> 09:13.494
Hi. So, um,
how'd that little talk go

09:13.562 --> 09:14.495
with Chang last night?

09:14.563 --> 09:15.596
Yeah, about that, Shirley,

09:15.664 --> 09:17.164
I gave my most
convincing speech ever,

09:17.232 --> 09:18.766
- and it didn't take.
- Didn't take?

09:18.834 --> 09:20.367
We're not giving him
a perm, Jeff.

09:20.435 --> 09:21.819
We just need to him
to sign a contract.

09:21.903 --> 09:24.038
Well, "need" is...
Is a strong word.

09:24.106 --> 09:25.772
I think Shirley would feel
more comfortable

09:25.824 --> 09:27.174
if we had something in writing.

09:27.242 --> 09:29.777
However,
I believe that we can handle

09:29.845 --> 09:31.879
whatever obstacle
comes our way.

09:31.947 --> 09:33.497
Aw, baby.

09:33.582 --> 09:36.634
Well, good,
good morning, everybody.

09:36.718 --> 09:38.152
Did you see
the stock market today?

09:38.220 --> 09:40.955
Up, down...
Pick a direction, huh?

09:41.022 --> 09:42.590
Man, I don't know
about you guys,

09:42.657 --> 09:44.592
but I've been circling
these want ads all morning.

09:44.659 --> 09:47.961
Now, who wants to take a break
and build a birdhouse?

09:48.013 --> 09:49.597
Chang, what's going on?

09:49.648 --> 09:50.931
I'm just getting
my act together.

09:50.982 --> 09:52.132
I got a baby coming.

09:52.184 --> 09:54.134
I can almost hear
the pitter-patter

09:54.186 --> 09:56.637
of little Chinese feet
across the treetops.

09:56.688 --> 09:58.105
And when that happens,

09:58.156 --> 10:00.608
I got to be
the best dad I can be.

10:00.659 --> 10:02.159
Right, Jeff, huh?

10:02.244 --> 10:04.195
Come on,
don't leave me hanging,

10:04.279 --> 10:05.679
my main mentor.

10:05.747 --> 10:07.481
Oh, hey,
is that a reason to leave?

10:07.532 --> 10:09.033
- Hmm?
- Jeffrey? Excuse me.

10:09.117 --> 10:10.651
Jeffrey!

10:10.702 --> 10:12.819
Let me ask you a question,
dad-to-dad.

10:12.871 --> 10:15.706
Why do I have to put
the vcr on three

10:15.790 --> 10:17.725
Bon is on five?

10:17.792 --> 10:19.210
Hmm?

10:19.294 --> 10:21.879
Jeff! Jeffrey!

10:21.963 --> 10:25.633
I know you not gonna make
a pregnant woman run.

10:28.603 --> 10:30.304
I know you not gonna make
a pregnant woman

10:30.372 --> 10:34.275
walk this distance between us.

10:34.342 --> 10:35.743
So I ask you to help me,

10:35.810 --> 10:37.228
and you take that
as an opportunity

10:37.312 --> 10:38.845
to get Chang
out of your apartment?

10:38.897 --> 10:40.397
Hey, who am I to stand
in the way

10:40.482 --> 10:42.216
of someone trying
to put their life together?

10:42.284 --> 10:43.868
- What am I, daytime television?
- Very cute, Jeff.

10:43.952 --> 10:45.452
Well, how cute is it gonna be

10:45.520 --> 10:47.288
when that lunatic
is dangling my baby

10:47.355 --> 10:49.023
over a lion cage
on alternate weekends?

10:49.090 --> 10:51.158
Could be pretty cute.
Are they baby lions?

10:51.226 --> 10:53.360
New low, Jeff, even for you.

10:53.411 --> 10:55.963
Shirley...

10:56.031 --> 10:58.432
Right. I'm not gonna make
a pregnant woman storm off?

10:58.500 --> 11:00.668
Mm-mm.

11:00.719 --> 11:02.069
Look at them run.

11:02.137 --> 11:04.038
They must die like
the maggots that they are.

11:04.105 --> 11:05.739
Whoa, Lukka, I didn't know
we got extra points

11:05.807 --> 11:07.208
- for killing villagers.
- He's amazing.

11:07.275 --> 11:09.009
And I thought I knew everything
about this game.

11:09.077 --> 11:10.594
Britta.

11:10.679 --> 11:11.612
Hi, Lukka.

11:11.680 --> 11:13.514
- No!
- Unbelievable.

11:13.565 --> 11:15.482
Guys, calm down.
I'm just here

11:15.550 --> 11:19.687
for my "trekkies do it
in the final frontier" hat.

11:19.754 --> 11:20.688
That's my hat.

11:20.739 --> 11:22.056
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

11:22.123 --> 11:23.490
- Are you sure?
- Yep.

11:27.746 --> 11:31.098
Hey, Lukka, you are
really good at this game,

11:31.166 --> 11:34.702
and there must be a reason that
you are so good at this game.

11:34.769 --> 11:37.171
Britta, though your flirtation
technique is hilarious,

11:37.238 --> 11:38.255
it's distracting.

11:38.340 --> 11:40.341
Lukka is kicking
serious ass right now.

11:40.408 --> 11:42.076
He just set fire
to a farmers market.

11:42.143 --> 11:44.345
Bang, bang, you're dead!

11:44.412 --> 11:47.648
Save your tears
for your dog mother in hell!

11:49.217 --> 11:51.251
Okay, fine.

11:51.303 --> 11:53.887
Wait a minute.

11:53.955 --> 11:56.307
You have DVD blu-ray disc

11:56.391 --> 11:58.525
"The Final Kickening."

11:58.593 --> 11:59.827
You let me borrow, no?

11:59.894 --> 12:01.195
Ah, no can do, Lukka.
Sorry.

12:01.263 --> 12:02.396
Thanks to guys like Pierce

12:02.464 --> 12:04.164
who kept writing "this side up"
on all my disks,

12:04.232 --> 12:06.033
I have a strict
no-lending policy on my DVDs.

12:06.101 --> 12:08.469
What would happen
if somebody broke that rule?

12:08.536 --> 12:10.654
They'd be dead to me forever.

12:10.739 --> 12:12.740
Maybe we watch
"The Final Kickening"

12:12.807 --> 12:13.741
together sometime.

12:13.808 --> 12:15.960
Yes, Lukka, maybe we do.

12:16.044 --> 12:18.345
May...Be...

12:18.413 --> 12:21.015
We...Do.

12:21.082 --> 12:25.119
Would you please leave?

12:25.186 --> 12:26.453
I don't want to play anymore.

12:26.521 --> 12:28.255
- I feel sick.
- She's strange.

12:32.460 --> 12:34.194
Hey, Chang, can I talk
to you for a second?

12:34.262 --> 12:36.630
Sorry, can't talk
till I see my face in this.

12:36.681 --> 12:38.932
Well, can I give you
some advice...

12:38.984 --> 12:40.234
Dad-to-dad?

12:40.302 --> 12:41.568
Oh, hold on, hold on, hold on.

12:41.636 --> 12:43.604
My pipe. Okay.

12:46.408 --> 12:47.941
What's on your mind, neighbor?

12:48.009 --> 12:49.827
Look, I think it's great
that you're trying to get

12:49.911 --> 12:51.161
your life together, right?

12:51.246 --> 12:53.197
But for your sake
and for Shirley's,

12:53.281 --> 12:55.115
I think you just need
to relax a little.

12:55.183 --> 12:56.950
Oh, I see what's going on.

12:57.018 --> 12:58.318
You're scared.

12:58.370 --> 12:59.987
Feel me coming up
on your tail, huh?

13:00.055 --> 13:01.221
No... no, no.

13:01.289 --> 13:04.291
Man, listen, I've been a father
for 11 years,

13:04.342 --> 13:06.193
and a good one for 9 of those.

13:06.261 --> 13:07.728
Now, I'm there
when they're sick.

13:07.796 --> 13:09.897
I pick 'em up from school,
help 'em with their homework.

13:09.964 --> 13:12.032
See, Chang,
it's not how you act,

13:12.100 --> 13:13.801
it's what you do.

13:13.852 --> 13:15.269
Well, I do.

13:15.336 --> 13:19.172
You think that pool table
put aluminum siding on itself?

13:19.224 --> 13:20.574
Ow.

13:20.642 --> 13:23.310
Uh, yeah, see, that's not
what I'm talking about.

13:23.378 --> 13:25.979
It just ripped.

13:26.047 --> 13:29.149
I'll go ahead
and consider that point missed.

13:32.153 --> 13:33.554
I got your text.
What's going on?

13:33.621 --> 13:35.155
Something terrible
has happened.

13:35.206 --> 13:36.907
My "The Final Kickening" DVD

13:36.991 --> 13:37.958
is missing.

13:38.025 --> 13:38.992
Oh, that's awful.

13:39.060 --> 13:41.028
Somebody took it?
Who would...

13:41.096 --> 13:44.031
Wait.
"Kickmuncher 3"?

13:44.099 --> 13:47.301
Wasn't that the movie
that Lukka was...?

13:47.369 --> 13:49.470
You don't think...?

13:49.537 --> 13:51.338
Unless...

13:51.406 --> 13:53.807
You don't suppose...?
However...

13:53.875 --> 13:54.942
No.

13:55.009 --> 13:56.443
That would mean that you guys

13:56.511 --> 13:59.446
would have to stop
hanging out... no!

13:59.514 --> 14:01.899
We have video of you
taking the DVD, Britta.

14:01.983 --> 14:03.751
What?

14:10.258 --> 14:12.259
You have a security camera
in your room?

14:12.327 --> 14:13.861
It's for an extremely
thorough documentary

14:13.912 --> 14:15.062
I'm making on my life.

14:15.130 --> 14:16.630
It's mostly footage
of me watching dailies,

14:16.698 --> 14:18.098
but every once in a while
it comes in handy.

14:18.166 --> 14:19.533
I don't understand
why you would do this

14:19.601 --> 14:20.701
and then
try to pin it on Lukka.

14:20.769 --> 14:22.402
Now you're just ruining
cool guys for fun.

14:22.454 --> 14:23.904
It's just cruelty, Britta.

14:23.972 --> 14:26.140
You're inhuman.
You're an inhuman person.

14:26.207 --> 14:27.240
You're a monster.

14:27.292 --> 14:28.609
Lukka's a monster for realsies.

14:28.676 --> 14:30.377
I did this so you guys
would stop hanging out with him.

14:30.445 --> 14:31.578
He's a war criminal!

14:31.646 --> 14:33.313
You're embarrassing
yourself, Britta.

14:33.381 --> 14:35.082
In what war is he a criminal...

14:35.150 --> 14:37.251
The battle for our affections?

14:37.318 --> 14:39.636
Uh, how about the genocide
in the Balkans?

14:39.721 --> 14:40.954
Hmm, yeah, you would say that.

14:41.022 --> 14:43.640
You just got caught
red-handed borrowing a DVD

14:43.725 --> 14:46.326
without permission.

14:47.946 --> 14:49.480
You guys have to believe me.

14:49.564 --> 14:52.900
He's so much worse
than tall Kyle!

15:01.943 --> 15:04.294
Hey, Jefe.

15:04.379 --> 15:05.629
Hola.

15:05.713 --> 15:07.247
What are you doing?
Who are these tiny people?

15:07.315 --> 15:09.166
I picked up Shirley's kids
from school,

15:09.250 --> 15:11.118
and I'm helping them
with their Spanish homework.

15:11.186 --> 15:12.669
- Hey, kids.
- Ooh!

15:12.754 --> 15:15.639
Ow.
Watch the cardigan.

15:15.723 --> 15:17.007
What? Why?

15:17.091 --> 15:18.525
To prove I'm a responsible dad.

15:18.593 --> 15:19.860
This proves you're a kidnapper.

15:19.928 --> 15:22.095
- What the hell's wrong with you?
- I am nuts, Jeff!

15:22.147 --> 15:23.347
Get with the program!

15:23.431 --> 15:24.731
Oh, my God.
What have I done?

15:24.799 --> 15:27.401
I can't believe I actually said
you could be a father.

15:27.468 --> 15:28.802
- I can be.
- Oh, no, you can't.

15:28.870 --> 15:31.021
You can't be anything,
and you never will.

15:31.105 --> 15:32.706
I pretended
to have faith in you

15:32.774 --> 15:35.108
to get you off my couch
and out of my apartment.

15:35.176 --> 15:37.194
Now, call Shirley
and beg forgiveness.

15:37.278 --> 15:39.696
Kids, why don't you get
your stuff together?

15:39.781 --> 15:41.865
I'll take you home.

15:43.868 --> 15:44.868
Who's Shirley?

15:44.953 --> 15:46.987
Shirley's your mom, dumbass.

15:47.055 --> 15:48.322
Our mom's name is Loquanda.

15:48.389 --> 15:50.424
Hey, hey, that's racist.

15:50.492 --> 15:53.093
Wait. Is your mom's name
really Loquanda?

15:53.160 --> 15:55.028
Yeah. You said you were
a friend of hers.

15:55.096 --> 15:57.397
Why didn't you know that,
dumbass?

15:57.465 --> 15:59.165
I do! I...

15:59.217 --> 16:01.268
Just playing
a educational game with you!

16:01.336 --> 16:03.103
- Right.
- Don't give me that lip.

16:03.170 --> 16:04.872
Hey, kids, you mind waiting
in the hallway?

16:04.939 --> 16:07.474
- Yeah, no problem.
- Go ahead.

16:07.525 --> 16:09.543
I want you to understand
something while I'm gone.

16:09.611 --> 16:11.345
You are a horrible human being,

16:11.412 --> 16:13.981
and I will never feel sorry
for you again.

16:14.048 --> 16:15.282
I don't care
what happens to you,

16:15.350 --> 16:18.285
and when I get back,
I want you gone.

16:18.353 --> 16:19.586
Oh, believe me,

16:19.654 --> 16:22.789
I will definitely be far,
far away from here.

16:26.394 --> 16:29.396
Hi, policeman,
how much do you pay

16:29.464 --> 16:32.599
for anonymous tips
about kidnappings?

16:43.769 --> 16:48.106
Here's your wallet, keys,
and pasties.

16:48.173 --> 16:49.724
They're nipple guards
for running.

16:49.809 --> 16:51.025
Olympic athletes use them.

16:51.110 --> 16:52.544
Buddy, I worked
at a maximum-security prison

16:52.611 --> 16:53.912
for seven years,

16:53.979 --> 16:55.780
and those are still
the gayest thing I've ever seen.

16:55.848 --> 16:58.149
Well, I find that
hard to believe.

16:58.217 --> 17:00.235
Jeffrey, I spoke
to the boys' mother.

17:00.319 --> 17:02.220
She's not gonna press charges.
Are you okay?

17:02.288 --> 17:03.388
Oh, I'm fine.

17:03.456 --> 17:05.173
I spent the night
learning arts and crafts

17:05.241 --> 17:06.907
from my cell mate, Chabo.

17:06.976 --> 17:08.326
Did you know
you can make an ashtray

17:08.394 --> 17:10.194
using only a cigarette
and a snitch's forehead?

17:10.262 --> 17:12.464
Yeah.

17:12.531 --> 17:15.800
Look, uh, Shirley, I'm...

17:15.867 --> 17:17.502
I'm sorry I tried to capitalize

17:17.569 --> 17:19.304
on your situation with Chang.

17:19.371 --> 17:20.771
Apology accepted.

17:20.839 --> 17:22.707
Punishment is time served.

17:22.775 --> 17:24.476
There's no cell on earth
that can hold Chang!

17:24.542 --> 17:27.211
I know this place's secrets.

17:27.262 --> 17:30.515
Winger!
Thank God you're all right!

17:30.583 --> 17:32.817
I've been looking all...
Hey, Tracy. What's up, baby?

17:32.885 --> 17:34.435
Why are they arresting Chang?

17:34.520 --> 17:36.321
I thought you said Loquanda
wasn't pressing charges.

17:36.388 --> 17:37.522
Mm-hmm, not against Jeff,

17:37.573 --> 17:39.073
but I talked her
into going after Chang

17:39.158 --> 17:40.458
for child endangerment.

17:40.526 --> 17:42.427
Shirley, he could get
three to five years for that.

17:42.495 --> 17:44.162
Are you sure
that's what you want?

17:44.230 --> 17:45.597
Because if we put
our heads together,

17:45.664 --> 17:47.031
we could be rid of him
for 20 to life.

17:47.099 --> 17:48.867
- Really?
- Oh, absolutely.

17:48.934 --> 17:50.335
All I'd have to do is testify

17:50.402 --> 17:52.036
that he tried
to sell those kids to me

17:52.104 --> 17:54.072
and throw in the fact that
he was teaching them Spanish,

17:54.139 --> 17:55.573
and any d.A. Worth his salt

17:55.641 --> 17:57.075
can make a case
for human trafficking.

17:57.142 --> 17:59.594
I like how you thinking.

17:59.678 --> 18:01.079
What is wrong with you two?

18:01.146 --> 18:02.580
Why are you doing this
to Chang?

18:02.648 --> 18:04.349
Andre, I'm doing this for us.

18:04.416 --> 18:05.750
We have a second chance
for our family,

18:05.818 --> 18:07.218
and I just want
everything to be perfect.

18:07.269 --> 18:10.088
Baby, that's what you wanted
the first time around.

18:10.155 --> 18:12.557
You did everything in your power
to make everything perfect,

18:12.625 --> 18:13.758
and look what happened.

18:13.826 --> 18:15.093
Are you trying
to tell me you cheated

18:15.160 --> 18:16.728
because I wanted what was best
for our family?

18:16.795 --> 18:19.163
No, I cheated
because I was a coward.

18:19.231 --> 18:21.599
But you took me back,
because while I was gone,

18:21.667 --> 18:24.402
somehow you learned to accept
the bad with the good.

18:24.470 --> 18:26.504
Oh, that's
the Greendale effect.

18:26.572 --> 18:28.640
Our school motto
is "lower your standards."

18:28.707 --> 18:31.459
Look, look,
I know you are ashamed

18:31.544 --> 18:32.911
about what happened with Chang.

18:32.978 --> 18:34.913
Hell, I am too, all right?

18:34.980 --> 18:36.247
But locking that little man up

18:36.298 --> 18:38.516
is not gonna make our lives
any less crazy.

18:38.584 --> 18:41.119
It'll only make prison crazier.

18:41.186 --> 18:42.654
I guess you're right.

18:42.721 --> 18:45.623
It's impossible to keep
the chaos from your lives.

18:45.691 --> 18:47.392
I mean, we learned that
in that movie

18:47.459 --> 18:48.927
we saw
with all those dinosaurs.

18:48.994 --> 18:51.763
- Jurassic Park?
- No, it's complicated.

18:54.350 --> 18:56.267
Okay, okay, time-out.

18:56.318 --> 18:58.403
Okay, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

18:58.470 --> 19:00.905
I'm sorry to you, you,
officer baby.

19:00.973 --> 19:02.273
Come on!

19:02.341 --> 19:05.276
No! No! No!

19:14.003 --> 19:15.253
Britta?

19:15.321 --> 19:17.689
What? You guys want me
to ruin something for you?

19:17.756 --> 19:19.757
Come on, you're being dramatic.

19:23.195 --> 19:25.330
We asked Lukka a few questions
after what you said.

19:25.397 --> 19:27.231
He told us
about his time in the army

19:27.299 --> 19:28.833
and...

19:28.901 --> 19:30.568
The things he did.

19:30.636 --> 19:32.737
I'm never gonna get some
of those images out of my head.

19:32.805 --> 19:34.238
If I ever go to the Balkans,

19:34.306 --> 19:36.474
I'm bringing some serious
cheat codes and walk-throughs.

19:36.525 --> 19:37.775
Why didn't you tell us sooner?

19:37.843 --> 19:39.043
Because I didn't want
to be the one

19:39.111 --> 19:40.645
to ruin another guy
for you guys.

19:40.713 --> 19:42.680
Britta, there's a difference
between telling us

19:42.748 --> 19:44.015
a guy likes nipple play

19:44.083 --> 19:47.452
and telling us a guy
makes hats out of babies.

19:47.519 --> 19:48.820
I guess the reason
this happened

19:48.887 --> 19:51.856
is because we've been riding you
kind of hard lately.

19:51.924 --> 19:54.592
How about from now on,
we promise to go easier on you,

19:54.660 --> 19:56.060
if you promise not to tell us

19:56.128 --> 19:57.996
any details
about the guys you're dating,

19:58.063 --> 19:59.564
unless
they've committed genocide.

19:59.632 --> 20:00.865
Or if they're left-handed.

20:00.933 --> 20:03.001
I want to know about that.
I'm making a chart.

20:03.068 --> 20:04.385
Deal.

20:07.423 --> 20:09.374
I guess I ruined game night.

20:09.441 --> 20:10.808
I tend to ruin stuff.

20:10.876 --> 20:12.410
- Come on.
- You do not.

20:12.478 --> 20:14.145
You want to watch
catfish with us?

20:14.213 --> 20:16.264
Was that the movie where the
guy flirts with the girl online,

20:16.348 --> 20:20.251
but then it turns out
that it's a fat, old woman?

20:20.319 --> 20:22.186
Oh. Sorry.

20:22.254 --> 20:23.821
It's cool.

20:23.889 --> 20:26.491
Maybe it's about catfish.

21:02.332 --> 21:04.700
Well, this was fun.

21:05.305 --> 21:11.785
