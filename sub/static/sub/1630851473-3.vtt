Val!

01:02.440 --> 01:04.520
I'm on my way.
Is it behind the big house?

01:04.560 --> 01:07.360
'Take the left track
and follow it down.'

01:17.640 --> 01:19.520
I'd forgotten
the size of these grounds.

01:19.560 --> 01:20.560
That's weird,

01:20.600 --> 01:23.640
considering how long it took us to
leave the night we were asked,

01:23.680 --> 01:26.400
when you kept referring
to their main product as Tupperware.

01:26.440 --> 01:27.760
So, where is your client?

01:27.800 --> 01:31.200
Howard and Julia have taken their
grandson, Jack, to France.

01:31.240 --> 01:33.840
Jack's parents,
Michael and Martha...

01:33.880 --> 01:36.040
Ah, they're the ones who
'met in rehab'?

01:36.080 --> 01:38.040
They live here, 'independently'.

01:39.360 --> 01:41.320
How's Jeff, by the way?

01:41.360 --> 01:42.560
Seriously?

01:42.600 --> 01:45.200
I've just told you there was
a smell coming from the cottage,

01:45.240 --> 01:48.440
and you're fishing about Jeff?
They call this a cottage?!

01:48.480 --> 01:52.640
Howard noticed some irregularities
in Michael's finances.

01:52.680 --> 01:55.160
He sent me to arrange
a power of attorney.

01:55.200 --> 01:57.200
And when no one answered the
intercom,

01:57.240 --> 01:58.760
that's when we tried -
Who's 'we'?

01:59.880 --> 02:01.680
Amber Jansen.

02:01.720 --> 02:03.000
Howard's right hand.

02:04.160 --> 02:05.720
Howard is left-handed.

02:08.760 --> 02:09.960
Nobody's got a key?

02:10.000 --> 02:11.360
Hence the locksmith.

02:33.800 --> 02:35.320
Oh, oh my God.

02:35.360 --> 02:36.760
Oh my God, I'm tasting it!

02:37.720 --> 02:38.920
Yep.

02:38.960 --> 02:41.720
Hundred percent cadaver.
999, right now.

02:41.760 --> 02:43.440
Breathe through the mouth.

02:43.480 --> 02:45.440
Look, don’t vomit here.

02:45.480 --> 02:46.920
You’ll contaminate the scene.

03:36.080 --> 03:37.880
This... Martha,

03:37.920 --> 03:39.320
do you recognise me?

03:39.360 --> 03:41.800
This is my husband, Wolfe.

03:48.240 --> 03:49.400
It's OK.

04:09.600 --> 04:11.480
Could they get it any hotter?

04:19.840 --> 04:21.480
Let's see what's hiding under there.

04:34.440 --> 04:35.680
You ready Maggy?
Yeah.

04:36.720 --> 04:38.880
One, two, three.

04:40.000 --> 04:41.960
Woah!

04:57.560 --> 04:59.280
Hit the deck! Down!

05:04.440 --> 05:06.160
Wolfe!
What in God's name happened?

05:06.200 --> 05:09.040
Y'know when you put a Mento into a
Coke bottle?

05:09.080 --> 05:10.800
This is the sulphur
and haemoglobin version.

05:10.840 --> 05:12.880
Not helped by the heat.

05:12.920 --> 05:14.560
Look at that.

05:14.600 --> 05:16.240
He had a pacemaker at 40.

05:17.240 --> 05:19.000
As if that wasn't enough
of a warning?!

05:19.040 --> 05:20.280
Oh, you've -

05:25.080 --> 05:27.040
Appendix?
Yeah.

05:27.080 --> 05:29.560
I'll inform Howard
and Julia Gilk.

05:29.600 --> 05:31.440
Well... I'll give them the gist.

05:44.800 --> 05:45.840
Hi.

05:45.880 --> 05:47.880
Look, I know it's weird, but um,

05:49.120 --> 05:50.400
I grew up in this flat.

05:51.640 --> 05:53.320
I wondered if I could
have a look around.

05:56.480 --> 05:57.960
We found,

05:58.000 --> 06:00.040
four sets of prints in the room,

06:00.080 --> 06:02.720
one set of leather fibres,
someone in gloves, maybe.

06:02.760 --> 06:05.280
But we only found one set of prints

06:05.320 --> 06:07.280
on the gaffer tape used to
seal the room.

06:07.320 --> 06:10.240
They match prints on a credit card
belonging to Martha Gilk.

06:10.280 --> 06:12.280
So he overdosed
and she freaked out?

06:12.320 --> 06:13.400
Don't jinx it.

06:13.440 --> 06:16.680
Michael was the sole heir to
Gilk Industries.

06:16.720 --> 06:19.520
I can think of 1.7 billion reasons
to bump him off.

06:19.560 --> 06:22.160
Steve, I think that maggot's
definitely drowned, mate.

06:22.200 --> 06:23.640
It's a beauty. Look.

06:23.680 --> 06:26.360
Assuming that its growth was
accelerated

06:26.400 --> 06:28.320
by the presence of heroin
in his blood,

06:28.360 --> 06:30.880
Michael Gilk has been dead
for,

06:30.920 --> 06:32.000
at least a month.

06:32.040 --> 06:33.560
So no blood samples.

06:33.600 --> 06:36.280
Dot, can you take a shot
of vitreous humour?

06:36.320 --> 06:38.160
This is a nice mattress.
Where's it from?

06:38.200 --> 06:40.840
Can someone get a picture of the
label for me, please?

06:45.160 --> 06:47.760
Yeah, can we open another window?
Can we open a window?

06:56.040 --> 06:57.320
Stop.

06:58.760 --> 06:59.760
Woah! Ms Jansen.

07:02.000 --> 07:03.600
This is an active investigation.

07:04.600 --> 07:06.360
I commend you on the gloves,
but be careful.

07:06.400 --> 07:08.160
Even they leave a trace.

07:08.200 --> 07:10.280
These are not for your convenience.

07:10.320 --> 07:12.920
There are needles everywhere,
like confetti.

07:15.920 --> 07:17.160
Hello,

07:17.200 --> 07:19.800
are you OK?
Yeah, fine thanks.

07:20.760 --> 07:22.000
There was loads of traffic,

07:22.040 --> 07:23.840
a big demolition job in Salford.

07:23.880 --> 07:25.040
Gilk Industries.

07:25.080 --> 07:26.160
Ironic.

07:26.200 --> 07:28.480
Can you get Dot to analyse these?

07:28.520 --> 07:30.080
I'm off to see Val.

07:30.120 --> 07:31.600
Martha.

07:31.640 --> 07:32.800
Martha!

07:45.040 --> 07:47.400
Dr. Slater's given her a sedative.

07:47.440 --> 07:50.360
Shall we fix a time to take her
statement at the station today?

07:50.400 --> 07:52.880
Can't we just take care
of that here?

07:52.920 --> 07:56.840
Mr Gilk's instructed me to thank you
in advance for your discretion.

08:03.400 --> 08:04.760
If Martha goes to the station,

08:04.800 --> 08:07.800
there's no chance of keeping this
situation out of the public eye.

08:07.840 --> 08:09.520
She concealed human remains.

08:09.560 --> 08:12.680
Two years ago, a magazine article
claimed Martha had had an affair.

08:12.720 --> 08:15.720
It was a baseless allegation, but
it sent her into a tailspin,

08:15.760 --> 08:17.120
both physically and mentally.

08:17.160 --> 08:20.120
You can't blame that for everything
that went wrong in this marriage.

08:20.160 --> 08:22.440
Tell me, what exactly do you
know about a healthy marriage?

08:22.480 --> 08:24.120
But I remember a happy marriage.

08:24.160 --> 08:26.560
It didn't have this many needles.
I was very good at hiding them.

08:26.600 --> 08:28.920
One way or another,
Martha's going to trial.

08:28.960 --> 08:30.080
Be realistic Val.

08:30.120 --> 08:31.240
Valerie!
Valerie!

08:35.360 --> 08:38.400
Howard will give you his prints -
but no blood, no DNA,

08:38.440 --> 08:40.160
not without a warrant.

08:40.200 --> 08:43.080
He's not having anyone in his
family in a database.

08:43.120 --> 08:45.400
Amber was Michael's nanny.

08:45.440 --> 08:47.520
He wants custody of his grandson?

08:47.560 --> 08:48.960
100 percent.

08:49.000 --> 08:50.600
He's already trying to spin a case.

08:50.640 --> 08:51.760
You're gonna help him do it?

08:51.800 --> 08:53.920
Remember the size of our mortgage?

08:53.960 --> 08:56.080
Someone's gotta be Team Goliath.

08:56.120 --> 08:58.120
Why do you think
I'm telling you this?

08:58.160 --> 09:00.480
Keep an eye out for Martha,
and she might stand a chance.

09:03.560 --> 09:04.760
Seriously?

09:05.880 --> 09:09.000
If she sneezed on you,
you'd call that 'intimacy'.

09:12.840 --> 09:15.440
I'm desperately sad, of course.

09:16.320 --> 09:19.440
But not surprised.
Would you say, Julia?

09:19.480 --> 09:22.160
No, no, not surprised.

09:22.200 --> 09:25.120
Amber, draw the curtains will you?
He can't see what he's doing.

09:28.760 --> 09:30.840
We don't want to delay
Professor Burgess.

09:30.880 --> 09:32.080
Kinteh.

09:32.120 --> 09:33.760
Val kept her maiden name.

09:33.800 --> 09:35.400
We've met before, of course.

09:35.440 --> 09:37.920
Val was just saying that,
and I'm trying to remember...

09:38.840 --> 09:40.160
..forgive me.
You kept saying

09:40.200 --> 09:42.880
you were the only black face for,
literally, miles.

09:42.920 --> 09:45.880
Your wife got ill and you
gallantly took her home.

09:47.600 --> 09:49.040
Martha took our name.

09:50.040 --> 09:53.480
And then, did the worst she could
to our son's body.

09:53.520 --> 09:56.240
Very much like her
'refurbishment' of the cottage.

09:56.280 --> 09:58.280
Martha's a good kid.

09:58.320 --> 10:01.080
She's not without her...
complications

10:01.120 --> 10:04.120
Sadly, Michael's addiction made him

10:05.600 --> 10:08.160
isolated, paranoid, weak.

10:09.280 --> 10:11.560
I don't think he could
take the pain anymore.

10:12.920 --> 10:15.120
Do you think he took his own life?
No, of course he didn't!

10:15.160 --> 10:16.400
I wouldn't be surprised.

10:21.000 --> 10:23.160
I told you to open the curtains.

10:30.000 --> 10:31.880
I'll be in my quarters when
you need to do mine.

10:40.600 --> 10:42.600
I'm a big investor in biotech.

10:43.760 --> 10:47.320
A lot of people are very confident
that in my lifetime,

10:47.360 --> 10:50.880
we'll see the first synthetic neuro
tissue from

10:50.920 --> 10:52.120
human source.

10:54.840 --> 10:56.360
We just need his brain stem.

10:58.080 --> 11:00.560
We are talking about cryogenics?

11:00.600 --> 11:03.280
I'd have to temper your
expectations, Mr. Gilk.

11:03.320 --> 11:05.440
Michael's been dead for some time.

11:05.480 --> 11:06.720
But,

11:06.760 --> 11:07.920
I hope you're right.

11:07.960 --> 11:10.000
Well I'm banking on it, Professor.

11:10.040 --> 11:13.440
Then there's a market of seven
and a half billion people.

11:13.480 --> 11:14.760
In the meantime,

11:14.800 --> 11:18.160
the only two things that remain
inevitable are death and taxes.

11:18.200 --> 11:19.920
You should try my accountant.

11:23.280 --> 11:24.360
Maxine not here yet?

11:24.400 --> 11:27.960
No, she's picking her mum up from
a police station. Again.

11:28.000 --> 11:29.880
I've hacked Michael's pacemaker.

11:29.920 --> 11:32.800
It shows he suffered from
tachycardia before he died.

11:32.840 --> 11:35.960
With a heroin OD, you'd expect low
blood pressure and a weak pulse.

11:36.000 --> 11:37.960
No other drugs in his blood? Coke?

11:38.000 --> 11:39.000
No, just heroin.

11:39.040 --> 11:41.800
And, not a life-threatening amount
either, given his tolerance.

11:41.840 --> 11:44.120
Bleeding in the intestines and
stomach would make sense

11:44.160 --> 11:47.280
if he had Hepatitis B or C,
or HIV, but he doesn't.

11:47.320 --> 11:49.720
The liver isn't diseased, either.
But you know what does cause

11:49.760 --> 11:51.200
tachycardia, internal bleeding,

11:51.240 --> 11:53.760
liver failure and death...?
Stage pause.

11:53.800 --> 11:56.800
Poison. Obviously. You wrecked that.

11:56.840 --> 11:57.920
How's the vintage?

11:57.960 --> 12:00.400
It's opulent, full-bodied,
and yet refined.

12:00.440 --> 12:04.480
There are no traces of talc,
paracetamol, caffeine or starches.

12:04.520 --> 12:07.000
In fact, there are no adulterants
whatsoever. It's clean.

12:07.040 --> 12:09.880
So the tachycardia-
Whatever sent his heart haywire,

12:09.920 --> 12:11.000
it wasn't the heroin.

12:11.040 --> 12:12.320
Do you recognise the lab?

12:12.360 --> 12:14.200
Judging on the purity,

12:14.240 --> 12:16.560
it matches a couple of samples
coming out of Salford.

12:19.920 --> 12:21.320
That was rude.

12:24.800 --> 12:27.720
Let's leave it for tonight,
if that's alright?

12:31.960 --> 12:34.520
Is this like a
'Less is more' conversation?

12:34.560 --> 12:36.520
Where were you this morning?

12:36.560 --> 12:37.880
I told you, I went to the hospital.

12:37.920 --> 12:39.120
Which hospital? When?

12:39.160 --> 12:41.360
Woah, hang on, Boss,
I'm not happy about the way you're-

12:41.400 --> 12:43.600
No. I just need to know
which hospital you were at

12:43.640 --> 12:46.280
when you saw demolition convoys
at a Gilk property.

12:46.320 --> 12:47.440
Salford Royal.

12:48.240 --> 12:49.840
You're a star. Get your coats.

13:07.720 --> 13:09.040
Grab what you can.

13:14.200 --> 13:17.280
Hey! No fucking way!

13:17.320 --> 13:21.040
If you can carry two,
you can carry four.

13:21.080 --> 13:22.680
You, five!

13:22.720 --> 13:25.000
You heard the man. Grab four!

13:27.760 --> 13:29.000
Anything worth having?

13:29.040 --> 13:30.720
There's nothing in this lot.

13:30.760 --> 13:31.920
But in these two,

13:31.960 --> 13:34.880
we're finding splinters from
chemistry glassware,

13:34.920 --> 13:37.480
condensing valves,
some of it high-end.

13:37.520 --> 13:38.640
Let's get it tested.

13:38.680 --> 13:40.920
We already did. It's
identical to the heroin samples

13:40.960 --> 13:43.680
we collected at Gilk’s cottage.
Five-star gear.

13:43.720 --> 13:46.480
So, Michael's own father is
shoving him pure heroin?

13:46.520 --> 13:49.400
What do you buy for a son
who'll take absolutely anything?

13:49.440 --> 13:51.640
A lab that makes nothing but the
best.

13:51.680 --> 13:55.320
I can also put Amber Jansen's DNA
inside the same lab.

13:55.360 --> 13:57.400
How? We haven't got her DNA yet.

13:57.440 --> 13:59.520
Okay, but who else do we know
connected to the family

13:59.560 --> 14:02.000
with post-menopausal grey hair,

14:02.040 --> 14:03.080
dyed blonde?

14:04.080 --> 14:06.920
Well-
Don't do the accent!

14:18.760 --> 14:20.200

14:21.320 --> 14:25.040
I've come to formally request the
return of Michael Gilk's remains.

14:25.080 --> 14:26.120
Seriously?!

14:26.160 --> 14:28.640
Howard wants to pop him in a freezer
'til the Jetsons come along

14:28.680 --> 14:30.440
and shove a battery up his arse?

14:30.480 --> 14:33.240
Maggy's just been telling me that
Michael's tox report came back.

14:33.280 --> 14:35.760
Nothing suspicious, no poisons.

14:35.800 --> 14:37.120
Thank you, Maggy.

14:43.120 --> 14:46.840
I just want
to make this painless, OK?

14:46.880 --> 14:49.000
Because Howard fights dirty.

14:49.040 --> 14:50.280
Two can play at that game.

14:50.320 --> 14:51.720
Don't start dick swinging.

14:51.760 --> 14:53.880
We traced the heroin
in Michael's blood

14:53.920 --> 14:56.480
to a lab operating
out of a Gilk property.

14:56.520 --> 14:59.280
It was bulldozed an hour
after he was identified.

15:00.240 --> 15:03.320
Howard owns lots of old
industrial spaces.

15:03.360 --> 15:06.480
While they stand derelict,
they do attract criminal activity.

15:06.520 --> 15:07.920
So it was a coincidence?

15:07.960 --> 15:10.360
I can place Amber Jansen
at the lab, too.

15:10.400 --> 15:13.920
Well I can't because I stole
the evidence, but,

15:13.960 --> 15:17.400
I imagine she's not above doing
Howard's dirty work for him.

15:17.440 --> 15:19.560
No one was murdered.

15:19.600 --> 15:21.240
Michael had diarrhoea,

15:21.280 --> 15:22.800
heroin bungs you up.

15:22.840 --> 15:24.520
He was vomiting,
bleeding internally.

15:24.560 --> 15:25.800
Explain those symptoms?

15:25.840 --> 15:26.920
Food poisoning?

15:26.960 --> 15:29.280
No, no, no, that would have to be
volcanic botulism,

15:29.320 --> 15:30.880
which this categorically isn't.

15:32.560 --> 15:33.640
Morning.

15:35.440 --> 15:37.360
Erm, Amber,

15:37.400 --> 15:38.560
have I got this right?

15:38.600 --> 15:42.120
Jack was living with his grandparents
for some time before they went away?

15:42.160 --> 15:44.760
Michael and Martha relapsed.

15:44.800 --> 15:46.600
Jack was removed
for his own well-being.

15:46.640 --> 15:48.200
You didn’t fancy the South of France?

15:50.720 --> 15:52.320
Julia preferred me to stay.

15:52.360 --> 15:54.520
I would give Michael food,
and so on.

15:55.360 --> 15:56.840
But then I received instructions

15:56.880 --> 15:59.200
to leave the supplies
at the cottage door.

16:01.240 --> 16:04.480
Do you think that he killed himself?

16:04.520 --> 16:05.560
If he did,

16:06.560 --> 16:08.400
Martha has the blood on her hands!

16:19.360 --> 16:20.360
Hello.

16:21.960 --> 16:23.040
Are you Jack?

16:24.160 --> 16:25.800
How are you doing? You coping?

16:27.040 --> 16:28.920
I just want to see my mum.

16:28.960 --> 16:32.040
I've come to take her fingerprints,
then yours,

16:32.080 --> 16:33.720
then I'm sure you can.

16:33.760 --> 16:37.800
What's the most disgusting thing
you've ever seen?

16:37.840 --> 16:39.000
Ohhhhh,

16:39.040 --> 16:41.040
I was on a train and the
man opposite me

16:41.080 --> 16:44.480
ate an entire Battenberg cake
in one go.

16:44.520 --> 16:45.760
I meant at work.

16:45.800 --> 16:48.440
Nothing that bad.
This guy didn't even chew.

16:48.480 --> 16:51.720
He just shoved it in inch by
inch, like an anaconda.

16:51.760 --> 16:52.840
Jack?

16:52.880 --> 16:55.480
Jack darling, Grandpa's going to
take you out for a drive.

16:55.520 --> 16:57.040
I do need to take Jack's prints.

16:57.080 --> 16:58.800
He's already got the McLaren out.

17:01.360 --> 17:03.520
Lucky lad's got a cool granddad.

17:04.960 --> 17:06.320
Oh,

17:06.360 --> 17:07.640
like a lot of men,

17:07.680 --> 17:10.960
Howard embraced parenting
a generation too late.

17:11.000 --> 17:14.520
Sorry if I was terse, Professor,
when we met.

17:14.560 --> 17:16.800
You understand.
Of course.

17:16.840 --> 17:19.040
You're doing a great job. But, uh,

17:19.880 --> 17:21.960
Jack does need his mum, too.

17:23.800 --> 17:24.880
Maybe.

17:35.400 --> 17:38.040
I was once put on Butabarbital.

17:38.080 --> 17:40.440
It was like staring up
from a sewer.

17:40.480 --> 17:41.640
You doing okay, Martha?

17:42.720 --> 17:44.000
Was that Jack outside?

17:44.040 --> 17:46.080
Yeah, he's just gone off with his
granddad.

17:46.120 --> 17:47.280
He's doing OK, though.

17:49.200 --> 17:50.520
What is it?

17:51.720 --> 17:53.120
They've taken him away from me.

17:54.200 --> 17:55.320
Did you try and stop them?

17:56.200 --> 17:57.880
How could I?

17:57.920 --> 18:01.000
You know,
when Howard thought I was cheating,

18:02.360 --> 18:05.000
he bullied Mike into stifling me.

18:06.320 --> 18:08.600
Reading me texts, me letters.

18:10.800 --> 18:13.960
He knew he put the fear of god in
Mike,

18:14.000 --> 18:15.560
but he did it anyway.

18:15.600 --> 18:17.120
When Michael...

18:17.160 --> 18:18.640
..Mike got sick,

18:19.760 --> 18:22.520
did you ever share the same symptoms?

18:22.560 --> 18:23.560
Never.

18:26.360 --> 18:29.040
He used to joke that
I had high immunity.

18:29.080 --> 18:31.200
Can you tell us how it started?

18:31.240 --> 18:34.040
We thought it was only
diarrhoea at first.

18:34.080 --> 18:35.400
But then,

18:37.040 --> 18:38.440
Mike vomited blood.

18:40.840 --> 18:42.720
And then he couldn't breathe.

18:44.320 --> 18:47.000
And then I lost both of them.

18:47.040 --> 18:49.320
Jack is still your son, Martha.

18:49.360 --> 18:50.840
Nothing can change that.

18:51.800 --> 18:53.960
You obviously don't know
any rich people.

19:00.440 --> 19:02.360
Martha's been sleeping in here.

19:03.800 --> 19:05.480
I think we should split up.

19:09.400 --> 19:10.600
What have I done?

19:11.480 --> 19:14.680
No, I meant, I meant split up.

19:16.800 --> 19:17.840
Mmm.

19:20.320 --> 19:21.480
Are you okay?

19:23.040 --> 19:24.320
My mum was an addict.

19:25.160 --> 19:26.480
Yours?

19:27.920 --> 19:30.120
Yeah, I didn't start off
where I ended up.

19:31.040 --> 19:32.320
Four foster families

19:32.360 --> 19:35.000
and the last ones
were the wealthiest, and

19:35.040 --> 19:36.360
bingo,

19:36.400 --> 19:37.600
they adopted.

19:39.640 --> 19:41.800
But this poor kid has to go
from top to bottom,

19:41.840 --> 19:43.720
and that has to be a shittier ride.

19:46.000 --> 19:47.240
Did you love her?

19:49.120 --> 19:51.240
Yeah, that never goes away.

19:51.280 --> 19:54.800
But since she married the guy that
broke my ribs and,

19:54.840 --> 19:55.920
my arm,

19:57.720 --> 19:58.800
we just,

19:58.840 --> 20:01.440
stuck to swapping Christmas cards.

20:06.080 --> 20:07.120
Hey.

20:08.000 --> 20:10.200
Let's get a Chinese tonight.

20:20.200 --> 20:22.320
It's pretty obvious which
fingerprints are Jack's.

20:22.360 --> 20:24.920
He’s the only child
on the bloody estate.

20:24.960 --> 20:27.400
Standard practice for
elimination, you understand?

20:32.400 --> 20:33.760
You sound a bit peaky there, Jack.

20:33.800 --> 20:35.760
Begging your pardon. He's a GP now.

20:43.120 --> 20:45.280
He saw the doctor this
morning for a check-up.

20:45.320 --> 20:47.160
Julia and I are very health
conscious,

20:47.200 --> 20:48.920
she's in with the doctor now.

20:48.960 --> 20:50.240
You know, a real one.

20:53.960 --> 20:55.480
Those looks sore.

20:55.520 --> 20:58.960
When I was your age, I was
a big nail-biter too.

20:59.000 --> 21:00.560
Okay.

21:00.600 --> 21:02.680
Okay, if that's done,
let's be having you.

21:03.760 --> 21:04.760
That's your lot.

21:11.120 --> 21:12.720
Is your stomach okay there, Jack?

21:13.640 --> 21:15.880
The doctor gave him charcoal for it.

21:18.280 --> 21:20.200
Come on, on your feet, Matey.

21:20.240 --> 21:22.080
I need to go again!

21:22.120 --> 21:23.560
Not yet.

21:23.600 --> 21:24.880
For his dignity!

21:27.800 --> 21:30.480
Castor oil would've had it sorted
by now, guaranteed.

21:30.520 --> 21:31.560
Come on!

21:34.880 --> 21:35.960
For ten points.

21:36.000 --> 21:40.200
Which untraceable poison symptoms
including coughs, vomiting,

21:40.240 --> 21:41.720
diarrhoea and tachycardia,

21:41.760 --> 21:43.800
is made from castor beans?
'Ricin.'

21:43.840 --> 21:46.240
If you're serious, we need to file
the case with Porton Down.

21:46.280 --> 21:48.520
You reckon the paperwork
will take less than two days?

21:48.560 --> 21:50.680
Is this about saving Jack,
or catching the killer?

21:50.720 --> 21:54.720
To prove it was ricin that poisoned
them, we need an antigen.

21:54.760 --> 21:57.760
To make the antigen,
we need ricin. And ricin

21:57.800 --> 21:59.520
'is very easy to make.'

21:59.560 --> 22:01.320
I didn't hear what you said, but,'

22:01.360 --> 22:02.800
'don't repeat it, Wolfe.'

22:02.840 --> 22:04.680
I've gotta go.

22:06.640 --> 22:08.040
Mr Gilk.

22:08.080 --> 22:09.920
What a beautiful car!

22:13.920 --> 22:15.160
Look, I'm not a doctor,

22:15.200 --> 22:17.480
I can't compel you to give me
a sample of Jack's blood,

22:17.520 --> 22:20.040
but it would give
you absolute certainty

22:20.080 --> 22:21.720
there's nothing more
seriously wrong.

22:21.760 --> 22:25.480
I'm a businessman, Professor.
I respond to reciprocity.

22:25.520 --> 22:28.360
I'd honestly give you anything,
I just can't give you Michael's body.

22:28.400 --> 22:29.720
Yeah, I don't want all of him.

22:30.640 --> 22:32.000
But given the decomposition,

22:32.040 --> 22:34.840
Michael's head needs to be in
Palo Alto by Friday.

22:34.880 --> 22:36.840
I can't let you decapitate your son.

22:36.880 --> 22:38.320
That's not me, that's the law.

22:38.360 --> 22:40.600
Just leave the red tape to me.

22:41.720 --> 22:44.320
I can drive you
to the morgue right now.

22:44.360 --> 22:47.040
Is that your solution
for all obstacles, Howard?

22:47.080 --> 22:48.240
Bulldozing?

22:50.280 --> 22:51.800
Oh!

22:51.840 --> 22:54.840
Oh, we're talking about
the lab in Salford, yes?

22:54.880 --> 22:56.280
Are you?

22:56.320 --> 22:57.760
Frankly,

22:57.800 --> 23:00.840
it matters not one fuck, Professor.

23:00.880 --> 23:03.040
If you've been, then you went
without a warrant,

23:03.080 --> 23:04.720
therefore trespassing.

23:04.760 --> 23:09.400
If you removed anything, it's theft,
etceterar, etceterarrrrr!

23:13.920 --> 23:15.480
When Michael

23:15.520 --> 23:18.120
made his very best efforts for me,

23:18.160 --> 23:20.160
they rewarded him
with Methadone treatment.

23:21.000 --> 23:23.760
There's no moral contest between

23:23.800 --> 23:26.400
serving him that garbage,

23:26.440 --> 23:30.160
or professionally
manufactured heroin.

23:30.200 --> 23:33.760
You know your organic, free range
shit is on the street?

23:33.800 --> 23:36.320
There's very little vetting that you
can hypothetically do

23:36.360 --> 23:38.800
with the kind of people
who make heroin.

23:40.560 --> 23:43.440
'If Jack's only just
been poisoned,'

23:43.480 --> 23:47.080
there is a good chance that there
is ricin in Howard's house.

23:47.120 --> 23:48.440
Before we can go looking,

23:48.480 --> 23:51.400
we need to prove that it is ricin
that poisoned them.

23:51.440 --> 23:53.320
We need to test Michael's vitreous
humour

23:53.360 --> 23:54.840
and Jack's blood for antigens.

23:54.880 --> 23:57.200
Involving the illegal
manufacture of ricin.

23:57.240 --> 23:58.640
Can't we just tell Betsy?

23:58.680 --> 24:02.120
Without material evidence, what can
she do to speed up the process?

24:02.160 --> 24:03.920
If we make ricin and botch it,

24:03.960 --> 24:06.200
everyone in this building
could be dead in 36 hours.

24:06.240 --> 24:07.800
It's nearer 72.

24:09.120 --> 24:10.920
We'll go to jail.

24:10.960 --> 24:13.720
Every case which has ever been
swayed by your expert testimony

24:13.760 --> 24:14.760
could get overturned.

24:14.800 --> 24:19.320
Look, I wouldn't ask you to break
the law to solve a murder.

24:19.360 --> 24:21.720
This is about saving a life.

24:23.120 --> 24:24.920
I'm in.

24:24.960 --> 24:26.080
Me too.

24:28.160 --> 24:30.520
You can walk away, no harm done.

24:30.560 --> 24:33.840
Don't you see how that would
make my job impossible?

24:35.360 --> 24:37.000
Right, I'll pop
to the garden centre.

24:37.040 --> 24:40.200
Oh, and where are we going to get a
sample of Jack Gilk's blood?

24:47.560 --> 24:48.800
Nice practice.

24:48.840 --> 24:50.280
You should have gone private.

24:52.760 --> 24:53.960
Butabarbital.

24:54.880 --> 24:57.120
This is Class B in the UK,

24:57.160 --> 24:58.800
but you prescribed it to Martha.

25:00.920 --> 25:02.640
Look, what do you want?

26:21.920 --> 26:24.120
Ricin definitely killed
Michael Gilk.

26:24.160 --> 26:27.760
Young Jack could only have ingested
his dose since his return.

26:28.920 --> 26:30.920
It's early symptoms,
he was fine abroad.

26:33.160 --> 26:34.720
Child Services need involving.

26:34.760 --> 26:35.840
No, no, no, no, no.

26:35.880 --> 26:36.960
No, the other way around.

26:37.000 --> 26:38.760
In the absence of
'what we actually know',

26:38.800 --> 26:41.040
we've got to find the ricin first.

26:41.080 --> 26:42.480
Starting, where?!

26:42.520 --> 26:43.720
In the cottage.

26:44.960 --> 26:48.160
Wherever it was manufactured,
there must be traces in there.

26:48.200 --> 26:49.680
Michael never left.

27:07.960 --> 27:09.680
See!

27:09.720 --> 27:11.320
We've got a bloody war crime
in our lab

27:11.360 --> 27:13.000
and no way of justifying its
existence,

27:13.040 --> 27:15.160
because the evidence
has been obliterated

27:15.200 --> 27:17.560
by fucking Squeak 'n' Bleach.
It's still a result though,

27:17.600 --> 27:19.440
if Howard's not guilty why else
would he do this?

27:19.480 --> 27:22.240
Because he can. And who's saying
he's not covering for Amber?

27:22.280 --> 27:23.880
Well, if it's between
Jack dying and jail,

27:23.920 --> 27:26.320
I hope you lot like making your tea
on a radiator.

27:40.280 --> 27:43.120
You know how I went to get power of
attorney over Michael's money?

27:43.160 --> 27:44.200
Uh-huh.

27:44.240 --> 27:46.640
Well guess where I
traced the cash to?

27:46.680 --> 27:49.280
A swanky old people's home in
Germany.

27:50.160 --> 27:51.160
Uh,

27:51.200 --> 27:53.320
Amber's been embezzling
from Michael?

27:53.360 --> 27:54.680
You know Howard's boffing her?

27:54.720 --> 27:55.960
I do have eyes, yes.

27:56.000 --> 27:57.600
Well, you'd be wrong.

27:57.640 --> 27:59.200
That used to be true.

27:59.240 --> 28:01.240
She was asked to leave.

28:01.280 --> 28:03.480
Julia then brought her back
from Germany,

28:03.520 --> 28:07.040
presumably on reduced wages
and permanent surveillance.

28:07.080 --> 28:08.960
Why in God's name would Amber accept?

28:09.000 --> 28:10.320
She loves this family.

28:10.360 --> 28:12.000
'This family'?
Mm.

28:12.040 --> 28:14.280
You say that
when you're presenting a case.

28:14.320 --> 28:16.080
What am I really here for?

28:16.120 --> 28:17.600
Oh, come on. On one level,

28:17.640 --> 28:20.520
what's the rational
argument against freezing yourself?

28:20.560 --> 28:22.560
Worst case scenario,
you just stay dead.

28:22.600 --> 28:24.800
You're talking about
reanimating meat.

28:24.840 --> 28:27.280
At best, you’ll get a lamb
chop that can walk.

28:27.320 --> 28:30.040
You ambushed me for that?
It’s in both of our best interests

28:30.080 --> 28:31.200
to resolve this.

28:31.240 --> 28:33.440
Jack's been poisoned,
for your information,

28:33.480 --> 28:35.840
Howard's destroying all the evidence
all over the cottage.

28:35.880 --> 28:38.640
You dragged me into this, Val.
Dickhead.

28:38.680 --> 28:41.720
If Jack's ill, I don't know why
you're not intervening?

28:41.760 --> 28:44.200
Jack isn't ill, not yet,
but that doesn't...

28:44.240 --> 28:45.760
I'm not supposed to know what
I know.

28:45.800 --> 28:48.800
One of them poisoned him!
I just need a few hours’ head start.

28:48.840 --> 28:50.120
Helll-oo?

28:51.440 --> 28:52.920
Someone left their keys in the door?

28:52.960 --> 28:54.480
Wolfe was just leaving.

28:55.400 --> 28:56.720
What're we celebrating Jeff?

28:56.760 --> 29:00.120
Oh no, these were a client gift to
the office,

29:00.160 --> 29:02.640
but Flick and her mates
can demolish 'em, though, yeh?

29:10.520 --> 29:11.640
Who is she?

29:13.040 --> 29:14.480
That's Theresa Gillespie.

29:14.520 --> 29:16.080
And for your information,

29:16.120 --> 29:18.280
that's me being kissed,
she's an ex-client.

29:18.320 --> 29:20.080
Oh drop 'client' and
we're a lot warmer.

29:20.120 --> 29:21.480
They spent the night at hers.

29:22.840 --> 29:24.600
Wait a minute.

29:24.640 --> 29:28.040
The whisky was a 'dark message'
from you?

29:28.080 --> 29:30.600
And this is the guy you still
have mixed feelings for?

29:30.640 --> 29:34.520
Stalking people like some creep who
got kicked out the territorials.

29:34.560 --> 29:36.680
Y'know, I've already heard
enough to prosecute you.

29:36.720 --> 29:38.880
Running my DNA from
illegal samples you took.

29:38.920 --> 29:41.040
Okay, out of the house, please.

29:41.080 --> 29:42.880
You serious? Me?!

29:42.920 --> 29:44.280
Yeah.

29:44.320 --> 29:45.760
- And take him with you!
- Hey!

29:49.960 --> 29:51.320
I am so sorry!

29:51.360 --> 29:52.760
I thought he was coming at me!

29:56.040 --> 29:57.680
Seriously?

29:57.720 --> 29:59.400
Oh, my God.

29:59.440 --> 30:02.600
I need your PayPal for my gymnastics
subs, before I get booted out.

30:09.120 --> 30:11.080
Y’alright Dad?

30:11.120 --> 30:12.240
Yep.

30:15.320 --> 30:18.240
Yes, I took twelve hours
to tell her 'no,'

30:18.280 --> 30:20.600
because I thought
I'd found a future.

30:20.640 --> 30:23.000
And it turned out to involve this...

30:23.040 --> 30:24.360
..fucking lunatic.

30:25.240 --> 30:26.880
I'm done here.

30:34.560 --> 30:35.840
Well done, Wolfe.

30:35.880 --> 30:38.840
Not only will Howard not be charged
for tampering with the cottage,

30:39.720 --> 30:42.120
we'll need a warrant
to enter his property.

30:42.160 --> 30:43.280
What did I do?

30:43.320 --> 30:44.760
You pissed off his lawyer.

30:46.640 --> 30:48.280
Now, what was so important?

30:52.880 --> 30:54.240
We made ricin.

30:57.400 --> 31:00.640
D'you know what you've done to me by
just saying that, you basketcase?!

31:01.440 --> 31:04.960
Wolfe Kinteh, I'm arresting you-
Betsy, behave!

31:05.000 --> 31:07.280
I can't prove that there's ricin
in Jack's blood,

31:07.320 --> 31:09.520
without confessing
to how I made the antigen.

31:09.560 --> 31:11.840
If I can't arrest you,
I'll get you sectioned.

31:11.880 --> 31:15.560
Unless we can find ricin
at the Gilk estate.

31:17.240 --> 31:20.480
How will I get a warrant without
throwing my CSI team under the bus?

31:20.520 --> 31:22.360
Well if we find ricin
then it won't matter.

31:23.560 --> 31:25.440
And if we don't, you can arrest me.

31:26.440 --> 31:29.400
Jeff lobs the punch,
and Dad gets thrown out with him?

31:29.440 --> 31:32.480
Your dad's hands
were not clean today, believe me.

31:32.520 --> 31:34.400
Yeah, because he cares.

31:34.440 --> 31:35.440
Stalkers "care"!

31:35.480 --> 31:37.640
Calling Dad a stalker's not cool.

31:37.680 --> 31:39.600
Alright? He's got enough labels.

31:39.640 --> 31:41.800
Mental health doesn't mitigate being
an arsehole

31:41.840 --> 31:43.040
when he's being an arsehole,

31:43.080 --> 31:45.600
and, believe me,
I can tell the difference.

31:47.840 --> 31:51.280
The only reason Dad was here today
was because you invited him.

31:51.320 --> 31:52.560
He rang to say.

31:52.600 --> 31:54.560
I hadn't the heart to disabuse him

31:54.600 --> 31:57.880
in case things went somewhere after
you'd sweetened him for the client.

31:57.920 --> 31:59.520
He was excited.
Are you deliberately

31:59.560 --> 32:00.600
trying to sound like him!

32:01.480 --> 32:05.000
I don't appreciate you being
such a child about this, Flick.

32:05.040 --> 32:06.640
There's nothing binary about it.

32:06.680 --> 32:08.640
What if it's neither of them?

32:08.680 --> 32:11.560
But y'know, give me a year or two to
get back on Tinder, won't you!?

32:13.040 --> 32:14.080
You missed one.

32:20.720 --> 32:22.160
'Where are you?'
Um, I'm-

32:22.200 --> 32:23.800
What the fuck
have you let them do to me?

32:23.840 --> 32:25.920
'This is a disgrace!'

32:35.640 --> 32:37.680
DCI Chambers,

32:37.720 --> 32:41.080
my family are being bullied and
intimidated by your officers.

32:41.120 --> 32:42.400
This warrant is a joke.

32:42.440 --> 32:44.040
Mr Gilk, sir,

32:44.080 --> 32:46.680
everyone needs to
leave this house immediately.

32:46.720 --> 32:49.440
Will you get this man off
my property?

32:50.960 --> 32:54.280
Howard, the warrant stands up, and
even if there were holes in it...

32:54.320 --> 32:57.200
"Holes?" You could drive a
fucking tractor through it!

32:57.240 --> 33:00.320
If you push back, people are going
to wonder what you've got to hide.

33:02.320 --> 33:04.760
So are you going to get
rid of them or what?

33:06.400 --> 33:10.280
When you hired me,
you said you didn't want a yes man.

33:10.320 --> 33:12.120
I'm telling you, no.

33:12.160 --> 33:13.800
Then I accept your resignation.

33:23.480 --> 33:24.600
Oh my God.

33:24.640 --> 33:27.160
Can I say first, that was the old
Val I just saw, and-

33:27.200 --> 33:28.720
And can I just say next,

33:28.760 --> 33:30.400
what the fuck
have you just gone and done?

33:30.440 --> 33:34.000
You were completely magnificent,
classy poise and tradecraft,

33:34.040 --> 33:35.080
it was like the old you!

33:35.120 --> 33:37.320
Well, it was the old you,
but you now, so...

33:37.360 --> 33:38.920
The only thing I need from you,
Wolfe,

33:38.960 --> 33:42.440
is to know that you can cover the
mortgage if I get the boot for this.

33:45.400 --> 33:46.400
Wolfe?

33:47.920 --> 33:50.080
Do you think there is something
missing from this bed?

34:27.840 --> 34:28.840
Hi Maggy.

34:30.160 --> 34:32.400
We came out pretty empty handed.
Is that right?

34:32.440 --> 34:36.520
Yeah it's mainly just muddy
clothes from the laundry piles.

34:36.560 --> 34:38.200
That's not mud.

34:38.240 --> 34:40.720
This estate is built on clay soil.

34:40.760 --> 34:42.360
Doesn't show up red on clothes.

34:42.400 --> 34:44.040
Yeh, well it's not ricin, is it?

34:44.080 --> 34:46.120
As soon as my boss wakes up,
this is over.

34:46.160 --> 34:48.080
I'm literally calling it a day,
Wolfe.

34:48.120 --> 34:49.960
Jack had red dirt under his nails -

34:50.000 --> 34:51.600
I'm getting too old for these.

34:51.640 --> 34:54.560
It's like a pressure cooker for the
peri-menopause.

34:55.800 --> 34:57.040
What're we looking at?

34:57.080 --> 34:58.120
Brick dust.

34:58.160 --> 35:01.120
Maggy, Dominique,
check the grounds, uh,

35:01.160 --> 35:03.920
mainly areas with high
moisture causing decomp.

35:03.960 --> 35:06.080
I'll take Steve if that's okay?

35:09.120 --> 35:12.120
Seriously, Maggy,
is this the time and place?

35:12.160 --> 35:13.480
If this goes tits up,

35:13.520 --> 35:16.160
an undisclosed relationship could be
the final nail in our coffin.

35:16.200 --> 35:18.320
But you can't just share a coffee

35:18.360 --> 35:21.320
No, only up to a certain point.

35:21.360 --> 35:23.920
We've just been flirting that's it.

35:23.960 --> 35:25.600
Why?
She's smart.

35:25.640 --> 35:27.680
Everyone in the building's
smart. Why pick on her?

35:27.720 --> 35:29.320
I want a relationship, Maggy.

35:30.280 --> 35:31.600
Look,

35:31.640 --> 35:33.120
I'm your line manager.

35:33.160 --> 35:35.920
Just tell me the truth
and you can stay on the team.

35:35.960 --> 35:37.160
I promise you,

35:37.200 --> 35:39.080
nothing's gonna happen.

35:39.120 --> 35:40.320
W-what, I'm-

35:40.360 --> 35:42.440
I'm probably not even her type.

35:43.920 --> 35:46.440
I'm too posh or, I dunno.

36:32.520 --> 36:34.440
Next of kin only, I'm afraid.
What?

36:49.040 --> 36:50.920
I heard Grandpa talking to you.

36:52.040 --> 36:53.880
He said my dad killed himself.

36:54.760 --> 36:57.600
Is that why you broke into
mum and dad's house?

36:57.640 --> 36:59.320
To get the card back?

36:59.360 --> 37:01.920
I didn't want anyone
to know what I wrote.

37:01.960 --> 37:03.320
I made dad kill himself.

37:03.360 --> 37:05.920
He didn't kill himself.

37:05.960 --> 37:07.720
I promise.

37:07.760 --> 37:10.120
I don't understand, sweetheart.

37:10.160 --> 37:11.720
What does the card say?

37:12.680 --> 37:14.080
I said I hated dad.

37:15.360 --> 37:16.680
But I hate you more.

37:19.640 --> 37:21.640
Because you never left him.

37:21.680 --> 37:23.040
Even for me.

37:25.760 --> 37:26.840
I'm sorry.

37:29.040 --> 37:32.480
And dad hid it from mum, didn't he?

37:32.520 --> 37:33.760
He didn't want to upset her.

37:34.840 --> 37:37.240
Why didn't you destroy the card?

37:39.080 --> 37:40.880
It was the last thing my dad read.

37:42.000 --> 37:43.440
I love you.

37:44.400 --> 37:47.120
I love you so much.

37:47.160 --> 37:48.920
And I'm never going to
leave you again.

37:53.080 --> 37:56.320
I don't understand how ricin kills
you if it's just lying in the card.

37:56.360 --> 37:59.120
It'll kill you if it's aerosolised,
if it gets right into the lungs.

37:59.960 --> 38:03.440
How do you aerosolise a powder with
something you buy from Clinton's?

38:08.640 --> 38:09.840
Oh, I'm touched.

38:09.880 --> 38:11.680
Can you tell me when
these stems were broken?

38:11.720 --> 38:13.000
And check the soil out.

38:15.320 --> 38:18.800
There are two sets of prints on the
card, Michael's and Jack's.

38:18.840 --> 38:21.040
But we know Amber wears gloves.

38:21.080 --> 38:24.280
It's possible that Michael found out
that Amber was ripping him off,

38:24.320 --> 38:25.960
she decided to silence him.

38:26.000 --> 38:27.800
But the card was sent to Martha.

38:27.840 --> 38:29.200
Hypothetically,

38:29.240 --> 38:32.600
what if Howard blames Martha for
enabling Michael’s addiction?

38:32.640 --> 38:34.320
And Howard's a scientist,

38:34.360 --> 38:36.040
he'd be clued up on ricin.

38:38.040 --> 38:39.680
Like I said, hypothetically.

38:59.120 --> 39:01.920
We'll be able to release
your son's body soon.

39:03.840 --> 39:06.920
I know that you're both keen to
get his head to California.

39:08.680 --> 39:09.960
Well,

39:10.000 --> 39:12.120
the science is speculative.

39:12.160 --> 39:14.000
I'd choose another word
beginning with S.

39:14.040 --> 39:15.760
But you know that.

39:15.800 --> 39:18.680
I looked you up,
you got a double 1st from Cambridge.

39:19.640 --> 39:22.240
Howard only scraped a 3rd.

39:22.280 --> 39:25.520
Howard played the genius,
I did the work.

39:25.560 --> 39:26.840
It was efficient.

39:27.760 --> 39:30.560
I'd love your help
with a theory of mine?

39:38.440 --> 39:40.280
Jesus!! What are you playing at?!

39:42.000 --> 39:44.120
It's aerosolised talcum powder.

39:44.160 --> 39:46.600
All you need is a card and some glue.

39:46.640 --> 39:49.400
How very childish.
It's ingenious.

39:49.440 --> 39:52.320
You told Jack to write the card.

39:53.640 --> 39:55.360
I don't want to be vulgar, but,

39:55.400 --> 39:57.640
do you have any proof?

39:57.680 --> 39:59.920
You know, when someone
treads on a plant,

39:59.960 --> 40:02.480
they cut off the hormone
that controls its growth.

40:02.520 --> 40:03.560
Without that hormone,

40:03.600 --> 40:06.360
all the shoots below the break
start to grow like crazy.

40:06.400 --> 40:09.680
If you measure the shoots, you can
tell how long ago they were broken.

40:09.720 --> 40:12.360
Five weeks ago, you made ricin,

40:12.400 --> 40:14.480
poisoned the card to Martha,

40:14.520 --> 40:16.120
then went on holiday.

40:16.160 --> 40:18.880
Sadly for you,
Michael intercepted it.

40:22.160 --> 40:24.720
Howard overcompensated

40:24.760 --> 40:26.520
by indulging Michael.

40:27.520 --> 40:31.160
By paying for his drugs,
making his drugs.

40:32.640 --> 40:35.880
His guilt was literally
killing our son.

40:36.920 --> 40:39.000
I thought a shock

40:39.040 --> 40:41.640
could pull him out of his spiral.
Say,

40:41.680 --> 40:44.200
if Martha left him.

40:44.240 --> 40:46.320
Who spread the rumours
about her affair?

40:50.680 --> 40:52.280
But she still wouldn't leave,
would she?

40:52.320 --> 40:53.840
Not even when you took Jack away.

40:53.880 --> 40:55.800
So what if she loved Michael?

40:55.840 --> 40:57.720
A good woman knows
when to put herself last.

40:57.760 --> 40:59.640
I've been doing it my
whole damn life.

40:59.680 --> 41:01.000
Come on, Julia.

41:01.040 --> 41:03.920
The sacrifices you made
were still a choice.

41:03.960 --> 41:05.520
You tried to take Martha out!

41:05.560 --> 41:06.800
For my son!

41:06.840 --> 41:08.400
I didn't dislike her.

41:08.440 --> 41:11.520
She was too thin, she was squalid
and uninspiring

41:11.560 --> 41:13.400
but it wasn't malicious.

41:15.360 --> 41:16.920
She was collateral damage.

41:18.840 --> 41:20.640
Same applies to young Jack?

41:22.160 --> 41:23.680
I didn't know he was ill.

41:25.440 --> 41:28.320
I would never, ever hurt...

41:37.920 --> 41:42.080
It was the most logical
thing to do, Professor.

42:21.480 --> 42:23.400
I'll kill you!
No - Howard!

42:23.440 --> 42:25.200
I'll kill you!

42:25.240 --> 42:27.440
I will kill you!

42:41.840 --> 42:43.400
I want him back.

42:46.720 --> 42:48.600
I want him back.

42:54.320 --> 42:56.520
So is it happily ever after
for Howard and Amber?

42:56.560 --> 42:58.400
No way, she ripped him off.

42:58.440 --> 42:59.800
I think he'll press charges.

42:59.840 --> 43:02.320
If I was Julia, I'd've killed Amber.

43:02.360 --> 43:03.720
Julia ran the business for Howard.

43:03.760 --> 43:05.600
Then he goes and shags the nanny.

43:05.640 --> 43:08.400
On balance, that might have worked
out better than killing her son.

43:10.280 --> 43:11.760
Dad?

43:17.640 --> 43:19.640
Can I stay with you tonight?

43:57.200 --> 43:58.800
Oh my fu...

43:58.840 --> 44:00.080
Maggy,

44:00.120 --> 44:01.600
you walk like a mouse.

44:01.640 --> 44:02.960
Aren't you with Steve tonight?

44:03.960 --> 44:05.760
Why would Steve be with me?

44:05.800 --> 44:07.160
Why indeed.

44:08.520 --> 44:11.440
But when you two get caught,
Dominique, it won't be personal.

44:11.480 --> 44:13.400
Last one in, first one out.

44:13.440 --> 44:15.080
That's a gender-free bye-law.

44:20.240 --> 44:23.080
Yeh, but this doesn't just
involve you, Dominique!

44:24.440 --> 44:25.960
Well aware of that, Maggy.

44:29.680 --> 44:32.080
'If we make ricin and botch it,

44:32.120 --> 44:35.440
everyone in this building
could be dead in 36 hours.'

44:35.480 --> 44:36.800
'It's nearer 72.'

44:37.720 --> 44:38.960
'We'll go to jail.'

44:40.280 --> 44:43.680
