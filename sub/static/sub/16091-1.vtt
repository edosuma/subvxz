Coming!

11:48.000 --> 11:49.797
Hey! Cody!

11:51.160 --> 11:52.639
There must be a place to sleep there.

12:15.280 --> 12:16.349
Damn!

12:25.560 --> 12:28.996
O Lord, Cody!
Take a look, shall we?

12:29.760 --> 12:31.079
O Lord!

12:44.400 --> 12:46.118

Let me see!

12:53.160 --> 12:54.513
You are very brave!

12:59.840 --> 13:01.558

. Okay?

13:08.560 --> 13:09.788
So, Cody?

13:13.040 --> 13:13.950
You make me feel bad.

13:16.040 --> 13:16.950
I know, Cody!

13:19.560 --> 13:20.470
What is it?

13:21.000 --> 13:22.353
This is my mother who gave it to me.

13:24.200 --> 13:25.519
This is a good luck charm.

13:42.680 --> 13:44.238
Come to Me.

13:52.880 --> 13:54.279
It's time to go, Cody.

13:56.080 --> 13:56.990
Elvis! Take it.

13:58.000 --> 13:59.956
We need you to go, Cody.

14:00.320 --> 14:02.151
Come on, Cody.
Let him go.

15:54.240 --> 15:55.514
You have?

15:59.200 --> 16:01.191
This is disgusting!

16:02.560 --> 16:03.470
Here .

16:50.640 --> 16:51.550
OK?

16:52.560 --> 16:53.470
OK?

18:46.760 --> 18:48.193
You are an alcoholic!

18:48.440 --> 18:49.668
I'm on vacation!
You know what?

18:49.920 --> 18:52.070
See if you find a cocktail straw or a small umbrella
!

18:53.480 --> 18:55.072
I'll see if I find a food
.

18:55.840 --> 18:56.750
Monitor back.

18:57.080 --> 18:59.275
I watch your back...

18:59.840 --> 19:01.273
You have very nice!

19:17.080 --> 19:18.229
Y have much left.

19:37.360 --> 19:38.588
Where are our weapons?

19:38.880 --> 19:40.074
On the desk!

19:45.320 --> 19:46.992
Get behind the bar!
Come on, quick!

19:49.120 --> 19:50.348
Take a machete!

20:05.960 --> 20:06.870
Down!

20:12.040 --> 20:13.268
This side is OK.

20:13.560 --> 20:14.470
Same here!

20:14.760 --> 20:16.557
Wake up!
Gentle and kind.

20:18.600 --> 20:20.113
Put ​​your gun on the counter.

20:20.960 --> 20:22.188
Put ​​your hands on the bar.

21:09.120 --> 21:11.190
Early Bird Special!
Do we wake up!

21:15.560 --> 21:17.039
The good news is that you are still alive,

21:17.280 --> 21:18.395
so that you are not bitten.

21:19.600 --> 21:20.794
So I'll take you to be awake

21:21.040 --> 21:22.553
ask some questions.

21:23.680 --> 21:25.477
The first woman.
Your name.

21:30.160 --> 21:31.070
Your Name!

21:33.520 --> 21:36.114
You want to play a female dog?
Perfect!

21:50.920 --> 21:51.909
Put ​​it in 312.

22:02.760 --> 22:03.670
Good night!

22:06.480 --> 22:08.198
My name is Kurt Conrad.

22:09.040 --> 22:10.359
It's me who owned the place.

22:11.160 --> 22:13.720
Let me apologize for the little scratches and bruises...

22:14.280 --> 22:15.998
You will understand our need to ensure our security...

22:16.680 --> 22:18.671
And, I need to ask some questions you
.

22:20.240 --> 22:21.468
Starting with...

22:22.160 --> 22:23.309
Where are you from?

22:28.200 --> 22:30.555
What do you expect to get just...

22:31.400 --> 22:32.992
By not responding?

22:34.120 --> 22:36.475
You hope to win a certain power over the situation?

22:37.840 --> 22:39.239
My daughter often play this game

22:39.760 --> 22:40.749
He has seventeen years.

22:41.160 --> 22:42.434
That's what you do?

22:43.600 --> 22:46.398
You  sulking like a teenager rebelling against
end of the world?

22:47.120 --> 22:48.553
The world is still there!

22:49.000 --> 22:50.228
Let's try again.

22:52.400 --> 22:53.719
What is your name?

22:54.600 --> 22:55.510
Elvis.

22:56.800 --> 22:58.119
You've just where Elvis?

22:58.960 --> 23:00.109
Nashville, Tennessee...

23:01.000 --> 23:02.638
After living in Tupelo, Mississippi on the
.

23:03.520 --> 23:06.239
I know, I lost focus
with your trip.

23:06.800 --> 23:07.710
I'm talented!

23:08.280 --> 23:09.508
J'portais a cape.

23:10.160 --> 23:11.718
I always sold out concert!

23:12.280 --> 23:13.918
This is really crazy!

23:17.240 --> 23:19.595
In fact, the State of Pennsylvania
said...

23:20.440 --> 23:21.919
It's your name...
Aaron Strawbridge.

23:25.200 --> 23:28.510
He also said that you are a
a highly trained emergency physician!

23:29.520 --> 23:30.430
Your doctor!

23:41.000 --> 23:42.228
I think it was your wife.

23:47.880 --> 23:48.790
And there it was your son.

23:51.160 --> 23:52.832
And the fact that they are not here with you...

23:54.400 --> 23:56.436
to assume that they do not come out with.

24:06.720 --> 24:08.836
We are the last of the human community,

24:09.280 --> 24:10.679
lived on this island.

24:11.080 --> 24:12.559
The survival of this community...

24:13.040 --> 24:14.519
Hang by a thread.

24:15.000 --> 24:16.718
And it is my duty...
To maintain perfect balance.

24:17.680 --> 24:19.910
So for me that the return to determine the mission...

24:20.360 --> 24:21.679
When and how...

24:22.120 --> 24:23.030
You can be profitable.

24:24.160 --> 24:25.513
Now,
your case to you is very simple.

24:26.800 --> 24:27.710
Your doctor.

24:28.120 --> 24:29.030
We just lost ours.

24:30.640 --> 24:31.550
But...

24:32.320 --> 24:33.230
Regarding your friend...

24:33.960 --> 24:35.791
I'm not sure he could bring us something
.

24:36.360 --> 24:37.270
What do we know that for now...

24:37.840 --> 24:40.798
Mouth because he is strong and relatively friendly.

24:41.840 --> 24:43.637
The two qualities that we do not need.

24:44.200 --> 24:45.110
Listen...

24:46.800 --> 24:49.268
My priority is to keep us i...

24:50.040 --> 24:52.156
And a strong jaw,
as you call it, is safe.

24:55.600 --> 24:57.670
Let him and I see what I can do.

25:00.680 --> 25:02.033
Do you... Aaron?

25:04.120 --> 25:05.030
Or Elvis?

25:05.360 --> 25:06.270
Rather Elvis!

25:07.960 --> 25:09.393
But you can contact me if you want the King.

25:12.760 --> 25:14.398
See you tomorrow.

25:27.800 --> 25:28.710
You can get out.

25:31.640 --> 25:32.834
What about your neighbors?

25:39.160 --> 25:40.354
Rather good, right?

25:41.160 --> 25:42.513
Here we try to do
more than just survive.

25:48.320 --> 25:50.038
That's beaches by which you arrive.

25:50.600 --> 25:51.510
It extends from east to west.

25:52.160 --> 25:53.388
This construction, there is,
avoided at all costs,

25:53.920 --> 25:55.558
this is all a death trap!

25:56.320 --> 25:57.912
We have a panel and solar power, but...

25:58.760 --> 26:00.034
Not a lot of work.

26:01.120 --> 26:03.429
We harvest rainwater everywhere on the field...

26:03.960 --> 26:05.837
It purifies... and stored...

26:07.720 --> 26:09.073
In a tank on the hill

26:09.880 --> 26:12.110
Infrastructure  is owned by the U.S. Navy...

26:12.720 --> 26:14.073
Before becoming a golf shot.

26:14.640 --> 26:15.868
They left full of crap here.

26:16.440 --> 26:18.635
From depleted, phosphorus uranium waste, nuclear
...

26:19.360 --> 26:21.112
This is a big concern because almost everything that grows here
is poisonous.

26:21.880 --> 26:24.075
Do not expect to eat coconut
for example.

26:24.760 --> 26:25.875
And this is the problem.

26:26.360 --> 26:27.839
Our ability to feed people is very limited.

26:28.200 --> 26:29.633
This is why we have

26:30.040 --> 26:31.598
using the selection process,

26:32.160 --> 26:33.991
before...
Receive new people here.

26:34.560 --> 26:35.993
And what is acceptable for those who are not selected
?

26:38.120 --> 26:39.712
We will come in time.

26:42.200 --> 26:43.110
And how are you now?

26:44.480 --> 26:45.913
Sixteen We are still alive.

26:49.040 --> 26:51.873
In fact we were safe from the Walkers

26:52.320 --> 26:54.276
month ago when a Dutch cruise ship

26:54.880 --> 26:56.438
Come aground there not far from our shores.

26:57.000 --> 26:58.672
Since then, the sea
brings all sorts of things on the beach.

26:59.400 --> 27:01.675
Food, bottles and pedestrians.

27:02.240 --> 27:04.800
So, every day, we clean up the beach
.

27:05.360 --> 27:06.952
We save what can be
and who to kill.

27:07.520 --> 27:08.873
This is our life.

27:09.440 --> 27:10.759
If you want to share will be participating.

27:11.200 --> 27:13.634
Bosser and especially hard,
please do not hesitate to get their hands dirty.

27:14.480 --> 27:15.674
A cold beer anyone?

27:17.480 --> 27:18.390
You have beer here?

27:19.400 --> 27:20.549
It's good, right?

27:22.240 --> 27:23.355
It's delicious!

27:23.960 --> 27:25.473
Please, help yourself!

27:26.000 --> 27:28.116
- Of the dried meat?
- Cargo from Netherlands!

27:28.640 --> 27:30.551
I think this is while you do not eat meat!

27:31.080 --> 27:31.990
Yes, long ago!

27:33.840 --> 27:35.671
How...
You meet?

27:36.520 --> 27:37.953
It is said that?

27:38.960 --> 27:40.393
I believe this is quite a story.

27:41.440 --> 27:43.556
Where are you from,
definitely a long journey.

27:44.120 --> 27:45.030
I my brother's keeper!

27:58.840 --> 28:01.991
Balls are rare, then
Please, be economical.

28:02.560 --> 28:03.913
And there was no hot water.

28:04.400 --> 28:06.834
It's broken for now, but
I'll try to fix it tomorrow.

28:07.280 --> 28:08.759
Try to rest,
published tomorrow.

28:09.240 --> 28:10.150
Good night!

28:10.560 --> 28:11.754
Good night... Timberlake!

28:15.280 --> 28:16.190
Kurt.

28:17.120 --> 28:18.030
What was there with him?

28:18.720 --> 28:19.630
For you to tell me.

28:20.120 --> 28:21.473
This is crazy. Be careful with him.

28:22.040 --> 28:24.076
Sanz, type the Castro cigar.

28:24.880 --> 28:25.756
Not last.

28:26.360 --> 28:27.270
We do not know.

28:27.520 --> 28:28.430
Alex?

28:28.800 --> 28:30.438
This is a young fool.

28:30.960 --> 28:32.791
Yes, but he's cool.

28:33.200 --> 28:35.998
Tommy? Bald tattoo, tribal...

28:36.760 --> 28:37.670
Be careful!

28:43.040 --> 28:44.359
That the property home

28:44.920 --> 28:45.955
this Portal is the only entry

28:46.520 --> 28:47.953
and keep the Walkers out.

28:48.440 --> 28:50.635
This  barricade between us and the whole island.

28:52.320 --> 28:53.958
Conrad think your boat is here, on this beach.

28:54.360 --> 28:57.318
You have to go dike when you arrive?

28:57.680 --> 28:58.829
I know.

28:59.280 --> 29:01.191
Or here... brick factory...
You cross?

29:01.560 --> 29:03.118
Yes, I remember.

29:03.320 --> 29:05.231
And then,
you cross the road?

29:05.480 --> 29:07.391
If you enable it...

29:07.640 --> 29:10.108
The boat you can be on this beach.

29:10.760 --> 29:13.115
Y Addons someone?
There is someone who hears me </ I>

29:13.680 --> 29:15.398
What is your location?

29:16.000 --> 29:17.911
Addons Military Base...
Just outside of London </ i>

29:18.880 --> 29:20.757
Addons Marchers began to run </ I>

29:21.640 --> 29:22.993
Addons I do not know why, </ i>

29:23.240 --> 29:25.196
<i> but they are dead, they
and they start... </ I></i>

29:25.640 --> 29:27.153
Running? Are you serious?

29:27.760 --> 29:32.197
Listen Addons ... we need a way to evacuate immediately
</ i>

29:33.280 --> 29:34.508
<i> serious </ i></i>

29:35.280 --> 29:36.190
<i> We need help </ i></i>

29:36.760 --> 29:37.670
Todd!

29:38.280 --> 29:40.475
You'll take them to the north and
get the boat.

29:42.160 --> 29:43.513
OK, give me one second.

29:47.680 --> 29:49.079
Are you sure that this is the right range?

29:51.200 --> 29:53.031
- This is crap, yes!
- I do not know what to tell you!

30:02.680 --> 30:03.829
This is your conception of the drive?

30:04.600 --> 30:06.511
- It's like life before the Internet.
- And TV.

30:06.960 --> 30:08.075
Or life after the internet and TV.

30:08.760 --> 30:10.796
Chatting enough. If we do this,
is that it is important.

30:11.400 --> 30:12.310
Our lives are important.

30:13.040 --> 30:13.950
See.

30:14.760 --> 30:15.670
You see?

30:16.200 --> 30:17.110
Slowly.

30:17.680 --> 30:18.795
Stay active... and moving.

30:19.600 --> 30:20.953
And everything will be fine.

30:21.360 --> 30:22.270
Passed bat.

30:23.800 --> 30:25.074
Well, no matter what it is.

30:25.560 --> 30:27.152
A machetes, sticks,
wrench...

30:27.960 --> 30:29.234
Use it to keep his distance.

30:30.040 --> 30:32.759
I protect myself. I was able to dodge.

30:33.400 --> 30:34.674
I can go.

30:35.280 --> 30:37.191
If you want to permanently get rid of
,

30:37.640 --> 30:38.959
using this technique:

30:39.520 --> 30:40.794
Take a step to the side...

30:41.560 --> 30:43.710
Hit between the fourth and fifth vertebrae,

30:44.240 --> 30:45.719
Damage to their necks in two.

30:46.240 --> 30:47.150
Who is caught?

30:48.520 --> 30:49.873
You! Go!

30:52.000 --> 30:52.910
No, thank you.

31:06.720 --> 31:08.199
Why did you, you
do not make as much?

31:13.920 --> 31:16.388
This is a good job!
I am impressed with your expertise.

31:16.840 --> 31:18.398
'Because I'm a girl?

31:19.200 --> 31:21.316
Sorry, but I'm not old
in the same mold with others.

31:22.120 --> 31:23.155
Listen...

31:23.800 --> 31:25.279
To make this work...

31:25.880 --> 31:28.155
Everyone has to play...
And the most effective way.

31:28.720 --> 31:30.836
The women were very effective in their roles.

31:31.920 --> 31:34.229
Et .. as the woman
ratio is four to one...

31:34.640 --> 31:35.959
This is very valuable.

31:36.840 --> 31:38.432
You play a Mormon or a peculiarity of the genre?

31:39.080 --> 31:40.195
This is the opposite Tweeter!

31:40.880 --> 31:43.394
I can ask all your two reserve judgment...

31:44.080 --> 31:45.832
Until you better integrated into society?

31:46.080 --> 31:47.399
- Colonel!
- Yes?

31:48.000 --> 31:49.831
This is Rachel.
I think he's sick.

31:50.760 --> 31:51.988
Pain or fuss?

31:52.680 --> 31:53.795
I know.

31:56.960 --> 31:58.234
Rachel?

31:59.800 --> 32:02.075
Here is Elvis, a new doctor.

32:04.640 --> 32:08.030
She fainted,
and before he began to wander.

32:08.720 --> 32:11.473
- You are a real doctor?
- Yes, we can say that.

32:11.880 --> 32:12.790
I will also.

32:13.240 --> 32:14.150
No, honey.

32:14.360 --> 32:16.112
No, you do not go well.
He ​​did not eat!

32:16.600 --> 32:18.113
Do you diet?

32:18.360 --> 32:20.828
Regime on the island, especially meats

32:21.280 --> 32:22.998
Gold
refuses to eat meat. But it will pass!

32:23.440 --> 32:24.350
- It will pass?
- Yes!

32:24.640 --> 32:25.789
Maybe I'll eat,

32:26.120 --> 32:27.269
m'donnais food if you are worthy of the name!

32:27.720 --> 32:28.994
Rachel, I can check you out a bit?

32:29.400 --> 32:30.753
We'll drop it there.

32:33.440 --> 32:34.350
Look at me!

32:34.840 --> 32:35.750
Right.

32:36.800 --> 32:37.710
Left now.

32:38.320 --> 32:39.230
Close your eyes...

32:39.840 --> 32:40.750
And... open it.

32:43.400 --> 32:44.310
Serre two of my fingers,

32:44.840 --> 32:46.193
for five seconds,
hard as you can.

32:50.280 --> 32:51.633
Do you play sports or something else?

32:52.440 --> 32:54.670
Yes.
J'reste in my room all day watching the wall.

32:55.040 --> 32:56.109
This is exciting!

32:56.840 --> 32:57.750
Seriously, you go out?

33:05.720 --> 33:07.551
If I had my equipment,
I can do other tests.

33:07.960 --> 33:10.110
What can I say for now is that it
healthy.

33:10.800 --> 33:12.756
no need to eat more.

33:14.800 --> 33:16.438
When he has been in this room?

33:16.840 --> 33:17.750
Ten months.

33:18.240 --> 33:19.150
Ten months?

33:20.120 --> 33:21.951
Not out of this room for ten months?

33:23.960 --> 33:24.870
Listen to me...

33:25.960 --> 33:28.030
It is not ready for what's going on outside!

33:29.760 --> 33:30.988
Do you understand! You have the eye!

33:31.720 --> 33:32.789
This is confusing...

33:33.200 --> 33:35.839
Being crowded and may need to talk to other people.

33:36.360 --> 33:38.112
- He listened to me.
- Someone other than you.

33:38.880 --> 33:39.995
I can how old

33:40.440 --> 33:41.793
last conversation with a woman?

33:44.320 --> 33:45.230
There is a long time.

33:47.000 --> 33:48.558
Every day there is something else with it!

33:48.800 --> 33:51.872
If you could only see and talk to him!

33:53.320 --> 33:54.958
But I have to tell you what?

33:55.400 --> 33:56.389
Just chatting girls, that's it!

34:06.200 --> 34:07.110
Opening her.

34:12.760 --> 34:13.670
I tweeter.

34:16.560 --> 34:17.469
You're Rachel?

34:18.600 --> 34:19.510
How old are you?

34:20.520 --> 34:21.429
I'm seventeen years old.

34:22.639 --> 34:23.594
Funny name, Tweeter!

34:24.960 --> 34:26.552
Maybe... but that is my name.

34:27.400 --> 34:28.753
Your parents have called the Tweeter?

34:31.320 --> 34:32.230
None. Is it...

34:33.840 --> 34:35.717
You have to give it its own name!

34:36.120 --> 34:37.838
Look, I'm not here to talk about my
.

34:38.360 --> 34:40.429
They say you need someone to talk to.

34:41.320 --> 34:42.230
I just want out!

34:43.400 --> 34:45.755
It thought I would...
Die... or kidnapped or...

34:47.719 --> 34:49.119
- Et .. when you go out...
- No!

34:49.760 --> 34:50.987
I never leave this room!

34:51.239 --> 34:52.467
I was forbidden to leave!

34:58.920 --> 35:01.912
Are there any other...
Other girls your age here?

35:04.360 --> 35:05.759
There's only you and the whore.

35:10.400 --> 35:11.310
I have a brother before...

35:14.560 --> 35:15.470
And mother.

35:18.320 --> 35:20.595
Give help me and tell my father
it is a problem child.

35:27.320 --> 35:29.231
Not but that it takes!

35:29.640 --> 35:30.959
Yes, yes, for whom it takes?

35:31.480 --> 35:33.038
Seriously,
would be better off without them.

35:33.560 --> 35:34.595
Do you think?

35:35.080 --> 35:36.399
We eat what we
at a gas station!

35:36.920 --> 35:38.433
From crisp packets and cans!

35:39.240 --> 35:41.356
I even spent a week eating my dog ​​biscuits!

35:42.240 --> 35:43.798
It's not so bad here!

35:44.240 --> 35:45.275
It is more secure.

35:46.120 --> 35:47.075
As more!

35:47.880 --> 35:48.869
I mean, nothing makes you happy with
?

35:50.200 --> 35:52.270
I see you smile ever!

35:53.640 --> 35:55.073
Qu'ya Of course things can m'rendre happy!

35:55.520 --> 35:56.430
What, tell me!

35:57.000 --> 35:58.035
I do not know anything about you!
I do not even know your name...

35:58.520 --> 36:00.511
I do not know if you have a favorite color!

36:01.320 --> 36:02.753
Finally, I think
that should be red!

36:03.560 --> 36:04.549
You have a favorite food?

36:05.080 --> 36:06.195
Starting with it.

36:07.400 --> 36:08.310
What you want to eat?

36:12.040 --> 36:13.473
Pancakes and hotdogs.

36:14.000 --> 36:15.069
Pancakes and hotdogs?

36:15.600 --> 36:16.635
What, really?

36:17.440 --> 36:19.749
Mean hot dogs wrapped in pancakes?

36:20.360 --> 36:21.270
No!

36:21.680 --> 36:22.908
How terrible!

36:23.360 --> 36:24.349
Today, the rescue mission.

36:24.560 --> 36:25.629
Take them with you.

36:25.960 --> 36:26.995
Mike, before you walk.

36:27.360 --> 36:28.429
Alex... You cover up the rear.
Todd...

36:28.800 --> 36:30.028
You teach them what you know.

36:30.440 --> 36:31.429
Tweeter sandwiched!

36:31.840 --> 36:32.750
Stop. He proved that he is a fighter
,

36:33.000 --> 36:34.228
therefore treat it as such!

36:34.680 --> 36:35.795
You have two balls each.

36:36.040 --> 36:38.076
So do not use these weapons as a last
.

36:40.760 --> 36:42.352
You start from the eastern end of the beach.

36:42.640 --> 36:43.595
Walk to the west,

36:43.880 --> 36:44.869
always have the sun at your back.

36:45.120 --> 36:46.075
Use your brain!

36:46.440 --> 36:47.350
There is no mistake!

36:47.640 --> 36:48.550
No drama .

36:48.920 --> 36:49.989
There is no hero.

36:50.320 --> 36:51.309
Come back safe and sound.

36:52.840 --> 36:54.114
Give me that gun, Backstreet Boy!

36:55.200 --> 36:56.110
T'aime even if I call you like that!

36:58.720 --> 37:00.039
Addons Oil is bad luck, </ i>

37:00.280 --> 37:01.713
pesky mango,
almost all rotten!

37:02.000 --> 37:02.910
Fully irradiated.

37:03.240 --> 37:04.355
And the only thing worse than
food is...

37:04.600 --> 37:06.636
Those pesky insect dammit!

37:06.880 --> 37:08.916
Y has one or two weeks, we found a bag of marshmallows
.

37:09.160 --> 37:10.195
It was inedible.

37:11.560 --> 37:12.470
A new shipment of the sea!

37:21.160 --> 37:22.957
Hey Tweeter!
You always want to have sex?

37:23.480 --> 37:24.595
It's disgusting, man!

37:25.080 --> 37:25.990
This!

37:26.200 --> 37:27.110
Hey, you two, come!

37:28.280 --> 37:29.633
I need help! Coming!

37:33.040 --> 37:34.234
You have been bitten?

37:34.480 --> 37:35.959
No! This is my wife, her right leg broken
!

37:36.680 --> 37:37.669
It is no more.

37:37.920 --> 37:38.875
OK. Let's go.

37:40.080 --> 37:41.035
Be careful step!

37:42.160 --> 37:43.070
Gentle!

37:43.480 --> 37:44.390
We were sent here from Miami.

37:45.000 --> 37:46.399
We were told that there is no
Walkers on the island.

37:47.720 --> 37:48.630
But the newly arrived...

37:49.400 --> 37:50.310
Continue to the next!

37:53.080 --> 37:53.990
Follow me.

37:58.360 --> 37:59.270
Help!

38:00.240 --> 38:01.229
I was there!

38:02.800 --> 38:04.791
This is absolutely contrary to everything we said Kurt!

38:05.560 --> 38:06.675
We turn around!

38:06.960 --> 38:07.995
- Let me pass.
- Where would you go?

38:08.360 --> 38:09.270
You will with it? This beginner?

38:09.640 --> 38:10.550
Yes, I'm going with this beginner!

38:14.320 --> 38:15.230
I'm back.

38:18.720 --> 38:19.630
You have been bitten?

38:20.680 --> 38:21.590
This is a lie!

38:21.840 --> 38:22.750
Bitten yet, OK?

38:23.000 --> 38:23.910
- And where is Phil?
- Drop your gun,

38:24.200 --> 38:25.110
no use.

38:25.360 --> 38:26.270
Drop your gun!

38:26.600 --> 38:27.589
My husband!

38:27.920 --> 38:28.830
It's up there, unharmed.

38:29.120 --> 38:30.394
- We will keep you out of there, okay?
- You have water?

38:30.960 --> 38:32.279
I require you to cut some branches.

38:32.720 --> 38:33.835
To make a splint.

38:34.160 --> 38:35.070
! What is your name?

38:35.320 --> 38:36.435
Emily.

38:36.760 --> 38:37.670
Go on, drink water.

38:38.080 --> 38:38.990
Just a little!

38:39.360 --> 38:40.270
I'll shoot your feet, OK?

38:40.640 --> 38:41.550
It would be painful.

38:50.800 --> 38:51.710
The Walkers!

38:58.600 --> 38:59.510
Should we ask! Wake up!

39:00.560 --> 39:01.470
Come on,
standing arise, arise, arise!

39:03.840 --> 39:04.750
Behind you!

39:13.400 --> 39:14.310
Alex down now!

39:21.960 --> 39:22.870
Take it!

39:23.840 --> 39:25.353
Boss, Alex!
You shot me!

39:48.200 --> 39:49.110
Move! Faster!

39:50.160 --> 39:51.070
Move!
Do not linger!

39:57.760 --> 39:58.749
Do not linger!

39:59.280 --> 40:00.713
Todd! Back and help them!

40:01.400 --> 40:02.389
Cover our backs!

40:03.720 --> 40:04.835
I will let him.

40:06.360 --> 40:07.429
Take?

40:07.960 --> 40:08.870
Put ​​him in bed.

40:11.200 --> 40:12.110
Stay with me!

40:12.440 --> 40:13.350
Countdown  out of ten, OK?

40:13.600 --> 40:15.192
- Where is the blood bank?
- In the fridge!

40:15.680 --> 40:17.033
Remove the bandage!

40:17.520 --> 40:18.430
What is your blood type?

40:18.680 --> 40:19.590
I... A negative.

40:19.880 --> 40:20.790
A negative!

40:22.200 --> 40:23.189
Give water to Emily,

40:23.480 --> 40:24.390
we may have to be amputated.

40:24.720 --> 40:25.709
Sit down and give him water!

40:29.960 --> 40:30.870
A positive... B positive.

40:31.720 --> 40:32.630
None! None of this group!

40:33.800 --> 40:34.755
I'm O negative.

40:35.640 --> 40:36.550
Sitting, it will work, you
universal donor.

40:36.960 --> 40:37.870
Give your arm.

40:41.200 --> 40:42.189
It's fast!

40:42.520 --> 40:43.635
Honestly, I feel good!

40:45.840 --> 40:46.750
I'm too negative.

40:47.120 --> 40:48.030
Perfect sit up!

40:50.040 --> 40:50.950
Hey! Look at me!

40:51.240 --> 40:52.673
Countdown from one hundred OK?

40:53.000 --> 40:53.910
I want to hear. Please count!

40:54.400 --> 40:55.310
Hundred, Four, 20-19...

41:06.920 --> 41:07.830
Hey bitch!

41:08.400 --> 41:09.310
A Walker!

41:26.200 --> 41:27.997
I repeat every day.

41:28.440 --> 41:30.158
You should keep your distance!

41:30.640 --> 41:31.516
They can not hurt you

41:31.840 --> 41:33.637
As you do not let you near.

41:34.320 --> 41:36.390
And what idiot thought that
was a good idea

41:36.800 --> 41:39.314
sunk into the woods with only one end?

41:40.040 --> 41:41.439
Who's got a great idea?

41:46.720 --> 41:47.630
It's me, sir.

41:51.400 --> 41:53.277
You have been drawn into a deadly trap! How is he?

41:57.240 --> 41:58.150
How's it going?

41:58.520 --> 41:59.430
This is good.

42:00.800 --> 42:01.710
Finally... He's still alive.

42:02.360 --> 42:03.270
And our host?

42:03.840 --> 42:04.750
Quarantine.

42:06.320 --> 42:07.719
You have to sacrifice two of my best

42:07.960 --> 42:09.075
to scrap interest-free long!

42:11.280 --> 42:13.032
Addons Sergeant Alex Waterman </ I>

42:14.920 --> 42:16.751
He was a corporal in the Ranger.

42:17.720 --> 42:18.630
A very good corporal.

42:21.200 --> 42:23.509
He ​​completed two years of service in the Middle East.

42:24.000 --> 42:25.274
And then bringing his expertise on the island.

42:26.480 --> 42:27.390
We owe him a lot.

42:28.960 --> 42:29.870
And he will be sorely missed.

42:34.720 --> 42:35.994
My grandfather...

42:37.520 --> 42:38.509
Died in Vietnam.

42:39.520 --> 42:40.430
In the woods.

42:42.160 --> 42:44.754
Definitely like this remote here, I'm sure.

42:48.200 --> 42:49.110
My father...

42:50.520 --> 42:51.430
John Waterman...

42:55.880 --> 42:57.916
What is hit with a rocket launcher in Kuwait.

43:05.600 --> 43:06.510
I am proud to join them.

43:20.080 --> 43:20.990
Let me shoot.

45:16.160 --> 45:17.354
<i> Two, four, three... </ I></i>

45:19.680 --> 45:21.159
<i> Two, four, three... </ I></i>

45:22.200 --> 45:23.189
<i> Nine... </ I></i>

45:23.560 --> 45:24.629
<i> Two, four, </ i></i>

45:24.920 --> 45:25.875
<i> Four... </ I></i>

45:26.120 --> 45:27.030
<i> Zero... </ I></i>

45:27.600 --> 45:29.238
<i> Two, four... </ I></i>

45:30.240 --> 45:31.355
<i> Un .. </ I></i>

46:02.200 --> 46:03.394
OK, Doc. True.

46:03.800 --> 46:04.755
While facing the camera.

46:05.040 --> 46:06.837
Why it would work.

46:07.240 --> 46:09.470
Well...
Bites are not the cause of this phenomenon.

46:10.000 --> 46:11.194
For the cons, they kill.

46:11.600 --> 46:12.828
And when they die ,

46:13.080 --> 46:14.195
them back.

46:14.640 --> 46:16.312
I think this could be a bacteria.

46:16.800 --> 46:17.915
- I'm just going...
- My father was bitten,

46:18.160 --> 46:19.434
This is our only chance,
so hurry a little.

46:19.680 --> 46:21.079
If we had more time in front of us,

46:21.560 --> 46:24.074
what we do is find all the major blood vessels
,

46:24.600 --> 46:25.589
Ligate them individually...

46:25.800 --> 46:27.472
And using a special saw to the bone.

46:29.360 --> 46:30.918
Although some complications...

46:32.440 --> 46:33.555
Amputation success.

46:33.960 --> 46:34.870
Unfortunately...

46:35.880 --> 46:37.279
Any toxin present in the bite...

46:37.760 --> 46:39.034
Once they enter the bloodstream,

46:39.760 --> 46:40.670
It's too late.

46:42.400 --> 46:43.628
OK, work faster!

46:44.360 --> 46:45.759
Try to gather as much of the body.

46:46.400 --> 46:48.311
That will take you twenty-five kilograms per procedure.

46:48.560 --> 46:50.152
I can not say clearly what will happen

46:50.520 --> 46:51.953
In case of prolonged consumption of...

46:53.120 --> 46:54.030
Or...

46:54.840 --> 46:55.750
What will happen...

46:56.200 --> 46:57.155
If someone eats contaminated meat

46:57.760 --> 46:58.670
and be one of them.

46:59.120 --> 47:00.348
No doubt it will become more aggressive.

47:03.600 --> 47:04.919
If there is,
we shall all be changed.

47:07.080 --> 47:07.990
Must get out of here.

47:08.400 --> 47:09.628
No, do not stay with me...

47:19.240 --> 47:20.593
OK, so here.

47:21.320 --> 47:22.469
Here is Costa Rica. Yes?

47:23.520 --> 47:24.748
You should go to the south due.

47:25.120 --> 47:26.155
Now

47:26.560 --> 47:28.278
Tell me, how do you mark
southern hemisphere?

47:30.880 --> 47:31.869
Thanks to the Southern Cross!

47:32.160 --> 47:33.639
Keep moving toward the Southern Cross and you will go to the south.

47:34.640 --> 47:35.834
Here...

47:36.040 --> 47:37.917
What is the benchmark for a change of course.

47:38.280 --> 47:40.350
Duration of a leaflet is seventy miles.

47:40.640 --> 47:43.279
Duration of a leaflet is seventy miles.

47:43.640 --> 47:44.993
They threw  float to the water and there are

47:45.240 --> 47:46.468
number of nodes in a given time.

47:46.800 --> 47:48.950
See? It's that simple!

47:50.280 --> 47:51.872
Holy mother of a sailor!

47:53.240 --> 47:54.559
You like it!

47:58.360 --> 47:59.270
Talk to me!

47:59.480 --> 48:00.754
- What you talking about?
- Never mind!

48:01.520 --> 48:02.748
On your day!

48:03.000 --> 48:04.752
Horrible!
As with all other days.

48:05.280 --> 48:08.590
I miss...
And I'm bored... and I'm bored...

48:09.120 --> 48:10.189
I understand.

48:10.600 --> 48:11.953
Listening.
You have to be patient with me.

48:12.760 --> 48:14.193
Your mother and I have a project...

48:14.400 --> 48:16.231
My Mother? Do you mean?
Talk about it!

48:18.640 --> 48:19.675
Stacy mean?

48:19.920 --> 48:20.796
You can also talk to him!

48:22.160 --> 48:23.070
Good.

48:23.800 --> 48:24.710
We will continue later.

48:47.240 --> 48:48.673
I want you you to see each other.

48:50.600 --> 48:51.510
Good luck!

48:52.120 --> 48:54.270
At least one of us will be gone in a month.

48:55.680 --> 48:56.749
It took less than twelve months

48:57.120 --> 48:58.951
for the
that the infection is decimating the population of this planet

48:59.240 --> 49:00.593
planet and we reduce what we are.

49:01.120 --> 49:02.599
But I see that you treat your survival

49:02.840 --> 49:04.671
a remarkable lack of seriousness.

49:05.040 --> 49:06.598
You're lazy, you ignore

49:06.880 --> 49:09.189
and surprise, you are fat.

49:09.560 --> 49:10.675
How could that happen?

49:11.240 --> 49:12.150
For lack of discipline.

49:12.960 --> 49:13.870
And I am responsible.

49:14.760 --> 49:16.876
If anyone has lost confidence in me...

49:17.880 --> 49:19.518
Or think she will do a better job than me...

49:21.320 --> 49:22.230
It took my gun.

49:23.000 --> 49:24.399
Because things will change.

49:34.440 --> 49:37.113
Starting today, we will double
rescue operations.

49:37.880 --> 49:40.155
All food will be put back behind bars.

49:40.560 --> 49:42.869
And I
rationnerai because I judge that it is a good thing to do.

49:51.920 --> 49:52.830
This is my brother designed it.

49:53.400 --> 49:54.310
This is our boat.

49:54.640 --> 49:55.550
One of the sink?

49:57.480 --> 49:58.390
You can do something for me?

49:59.800 --> 50:00.710
What kind is it?

50:01.120 --> 50:02.030
Check if it still exists!

50:05.760 --> 50:07.113
This is my father who said he was drowned!

50:08.960 --> 50:09.870
Damn!

50:10.560 --> 50:11.470
How can you have all of this?

50:12.280 --> 50:13.554
This is my father who gave it to me.

50:13.800 --> 50:15.836
I just set aside for the day I leave here.

50:16.040 --> 50:17.029
But for now, I'm stuck here
,

50:17.320 --> 50:18.230
that's why I need you.

50:18.920 --> 50:19.830
I will draw a map.

50:24.120 --> 50:25.678
You have to pass through the barricades

50:26.000 --> 50:26.910
This is the only way to avoid
guard.

50:28.600 --> 50:29.510
Thank you for the lift!

50:31.720 --> 50:32.630
Good night!

50:33.800 --> 50:34.835
Hey, Elvis!

50:35.560 --> 50:36.709
Are you going to travel with me?

50:37.160 --> 50:38.070
I'll need your own review.

50:38.640 --> 50:39.550
What you need to talk about?

50:40.760 --> 50:41.749
From a variety of health problems.

50:43.000 --> 50:44.194
Do not worry,
it is a big boy!

50:47.480 --> 50:48.833
OK, I come! Are you okay?

51:16.520 --> 51:18.590
How do you feel,
Elvis, you okay?

51:20.080 --> 51:20.990
I wear.

51:21.760 --> 51:23.273
In Pittsburg because I have m'battre!

51:23.600 --> 51:25.477
You think I'm a tough guy, huh?

51:26.280 --> 51:27.190
A lot of people think.

51:28.960 --> 51:32.635
Si .. we can not forget
primitive behavior...

51:33.400 --> 51:35.391
We will not survive.

51:43.120 --> 51:44.394
I have two daughters.

51:46.280 --> 51:47.474
And a woman.

51:48.080 --> 51:49.308
Two months after we landed...

51:50.320 --> 51:51.548
My eldest daughter, Stacy...

51:53.160 --> 51:54.434
What is sick.

51:55.840 --> 51:56.989
He suffered...

51:57.200 --> 51:58.758
Malnutrition.

51:59.800 --> 52:01.916
My wife is in total denial of it.

52:02.280 --> 52:03.474
Probably because he can not

52:03.720 --> 52:04.789
accept what happened to her son.

52:06.560 --> 52:07.913
So I let things go.

52:12.440 --> 52:13.555
Day she turned...

52:14.040 --> 52:15.155
I'm on patrol.

52:15.880 --> 52:17.029
And my wife...

52:18.040 --> 52:19.996
Can not...
Helping to hug him.

52:20.840 --> 52:22.432
As if that would fix everything.

52:24.160 --> 52:25.559
And when I finally came home,

52:25.920 --> 52:26.830
they are both parts.

52:28.400 --> 52:29.310
And I have...

52:37.560 --> 52:39.039
You do not have any other way.

52:44.600 --> 52:46.192
Family  The only thing left is Rachel
.

52:47.400 --> 52:48.594
And I do not want to starve.

52:58.840 --> 52:59.750
Good evening, Mr. Vernon.

53:01.240 --> 53:03.356
My name is Kurt Conrad.

53:03.680 --> 53:05.875
It's me who owned the place.

53:06.520 --> 53:08.556
I apologize for the inconvenience but we have to make
You are here

53:08.800 --> 53:10.438
until we are sure that you are not yet infected.

53:10.880 --> 53:11.790
I'm sure you understand.

53:12.680 --> 53:13.590
And my condolences.

53:18.080 --> 53:18.990
That's it?

53:20.080 --> 53:20.990
That's what you have to say?

53:21.560 --> 53:22.470
Look at him.

53:25.160 --> 53:27.913
How...
May be... be helpful?

53:39.280 --> 53:40.190
Addons This is not </ i>

53:40.440 --> 53:42.032
<i> Yes, I think we're ready </ i></i>

53:42.840 --> 53:45.195
<i> Kurt, you are almost ready,
and you're up there </ I></i>

53:45.960 --> 53:48.599
<i> Yes, I am ready.
I can now </ I></i>

53:49.120 --> 53:50.109
<i> </ i></i>

53:50.360 --> 53:52.396
Oula, kids!
I have to show you

53:52.760 --> 53:54.159
how to wrap a gift a little better!

54:00.040 --> 54:00.950
What are we doing here?

54:01.520 --> 54:02.669
I think you know what we're doing here
.

54:07.120 --> 54:09.156
We're here to flesh reap
Vernon.

54:13.000 --> 54:14.228
Do not reject everything about me.

54:15.280 --> 54:17.350
I saw...
Walking in the dark...

54:17.720 --> 54:19.278
And I know you do not feel so bad there.

54:19.800 --> 54:20.949
I only ask one thing.

54:21.280 --> 54:23.111
This
to open eyes and acknowledge it.

54:25.240 --> 54:26.150
I do not know it's hard.

54:28.280 --> 54:29.190
Singa...

54:30.000 --> 54:31.399
Kill the deer.

54:32.680 --> 54:34.716
It sounds cruel... and unforgiving.

54:36.280 --> 54:38.191
If you follow the lion over his backpack...

54:39.240 --> 54:41.356
You will notice that everything he did, in fact,

54:41.680 --> 54:43.079
this is to feed his family.

54:43.320 --> 54:44.435
This is what you and I we're doing here.

54:44.680 --> 54:46.636
We are here to feed our families.

54:47.040 --> 54:48.359
I can not do it!

54:48.600 --> 54:50.033
Of course!
Because he must!

54:50.440 --> 54:51.668
You're the only one who knows how to do
.

54:51.920 --> 54:53.831
From the moment he dies, he will change
!

54:54.080 --> 54:56.150
This means that meat,
will be lost to us.

54:59.360 --> 55:01.157
Fuck you!

55:07.200 --> 55:09.031
Damn! Damn it!

55:14.000 --> 55:15.194
In your opinion, why are you here?

55:20.280 --> 55:22.350
Do you have...
Not heard a single word of what I'm saying?

55:24.080 --> 55:25.832
I lost my wife...

55:26.040 --> 55:27.029
I lost my daughter

55:27.520 --> 55:28.794
Since I have not been doing the right thing...

55:29.120 --> 55:30.030
When he had to do it!

55:31.640 --> 55:33.471
You...
You have a duty to feed your family.

55:36.360 --> 55:38.351
Tweeter... Rachel you.

55:40.080 --> 55:40.990
They can not do that!

55:43.520 --> 55:44.430
But we, yes!

55:48.800 --> 55:49.710
You want to be the King, Elvis?

55:51.960 --> 55:53.154
So you as a behavior.

55:53.600 --> 55:55.033
I'm waiting for you inside.

56:15.480 --> 56:16.959
Vernon.

56:17.200 --> 56:18.269
Do you?

56:18.520 --> 56:19.430
This is a good sign.

56:19.760 --> 56:20.670
You'll get out of here.

56:22.680 --> 56:24.079
But I will first give vitamin
back.

56:26.680 --> 56:28.238
You will feel the pinch a bit.

56:33.000 --> 56:33.910
We have to go fast.

56:34.760 --> 56:36.239
Taken from largest to smallest.

56:36.480 --> 56:39.119
Start with your hips and legs
, shoulder and arm.

56:40.200 --> 56:42.919
Keep ligating arteries to restrict blood loss.

56:43.400 --> 56:44.310
Where do you go?

56:47.160 --> 56:49.355
This is a test...
You must be overcome only

56:52.240 --> 56:53.150
After the completion...

56:53.600 --> 56:54.999
Dishes...
The piece in the salt.

56:55.480 --> 56:56.390
I stay outside.

57:18.680 --> 57:20.113
<i> My God, this cake is sad </ i></i>

57:22.600 --> 57:25.160
<i> Rachel OK, I think we're at it, there is </ I></i>

57:25.400 --> 57:27.516
Addons I'm still going to have to wait a long time
</ i>

57:27.760 --> 57:29.079
Addons almost fucking there </ i>

57:29.320 --> 57:30.309
Addons I know, but you can still pretend
</ i>

57:30.600 --> 57:31.510
<i> OK. Ready </ i></i>

57:33.000 --> 57:34.194
<i> Okay, I can come up </ i></i>

57:34.680 --> 57:35.715
<i> Attention Girl </ i></i>

57:36.080 --> 57:36.990
Addons Here men from the house to show her face
</ i>

57:38.520 --> 57:39.475
Addons  Do not deceive, Kurt </ i>

57:46.240 --> 57:48.037
<i> Great! Dad, you really do not
eighty-five years you </ i></i>

57:48.400 --> 57:49.355
<i> Oh, it's too good, Stacy </ I></i>

57:51.360 --> 57:53.635
But beware!
I have a knife in hand!

57:53.880 --> 57:55.632
Addons And I feel that I will cause major damage
</ i>

57:55.880 --> 57:57.996
Addons Careful, ugly cake that has the courage to remember
</ i>

57:58.440 --> 57:59.839
<i> I being a parent </ i></i>

58:05.520 --> 58:06.430
Addons And if you open your gifts </ i>

58:20.320 --> 58:22.117
Addons Everyone set for a small family photo </ i>

58:30.120 --> 58:31.030
<i> Oh, sorry </ i></i>

58:31.520 --> 58:32.430
Addons Do not answer,
it's your birthday today </ i>

58:32.720 --> 58:33.630
<i> Yes, I know </ i></i>

58:39.000 --> 58:39.910
Addons I have for both </ i >

58:42.880 --> 58:44.472
Addons  You know, we just want to tell you that
loves you, Father </ i>

58:45.360 --> 58:46.270
Addons I love you, Kurt </ I>

58:48.600 --> 58:49.953
<i> kiss, in
You will still full </ I></i>

59:12.560 --> 59:13.879
I wish I could tell you that it becomes less and less
...

59:14.560 --> 59:15.470
It's hard...

59:17.200 --> 59:18.110
But this does not happen.

59:19.120 --> 59:20.155
Thank you.

59:20.680 --> 59:21.715
I'll get him out.

01:01:21.440 --> 01:01:22.350
What happened?

01:01:32.760 --> 01:01:34.955
The more I thought about it
I understand this person.

01:01:37.520 --> 01:01:39.272
And again, too
for us it makes sense.

01:01:41.680 --> 01:01:42.999
Well, this is ridiculous!

01:01:43.240 --> 01:01:45.515
It will disappear and you take Rachel
with us!

01:01:45.920 --> 01:01:46.830
No, no, no!

01:01:47.240 --> 01:01:48.434
This is just what to do!

01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:50.638
He does what he must do to keep

01:01:50.880 --> 01:01:51.995
the people he loved in life!

01:01:52.360 --> 01:01:54.555
And  turned into another damn food!

01:01:54.880 --> 01:01:57.633
There is no future for us
anywhere in the world!

01:01:58.320 --> 01:01:59.469
Herein played!

01:02:03.880 --> 01:02:05.552
You think you'll be on another island where
is the food?

01:02:07.640 --> 01:02:09.073
Another island where there will be TV dinners?

01:02:10.760 --> 01:02:11.795
You do not even have a boat!

01:02:19.360 --> 01:02:20.918
This is the first time since the onset

01:02:21.120 --> 01:02:22.951
j'me not feel safer with you than the other!

01:02:25.440 --> 01:02:26.714
I do not know if I can trust you anymore
.

01:02:27.360 --> 01:02:28.270
I beg you, do not say it!

01:03:10.760 --> 01:03:12.318
If you could go anywhere, where would you go
?

01:03:13.600 --> 01:03:14.715
As far as possible.

01:03:14.960 --> 01:03:16.109
We will take a boat and
get out of here.

01:03:16.720 --> 01:03:18.312
Do you think we'll get there all alone
the two?

01:03:19.240 --> 01:03:20.593
Yes, we have to go there.

01:03:22.720 --> 01:03:23.630
I will collect some stuff.

01:03:24.800 --> 01:03:25.710
Be ready, OK?

01:04:22.520 --> 01:04:23.430
What are you doing here?

01:04:25.440 --> 01:04:26.350
I went for a walk.

01:04:28.440 --> 01:04:29.350
And you, what are you doing here?

01:04:32.040 --> 01:04:32.950
I hunt with red hair!

01:04:34.760 --> 01:04:35.670
You know, it's more dangerous...

01:04:35.880 --> 01:04:37.029
Enough to run like this all alone!

01:04:37.800 --> 01:04:39.313
Let me go at it.

01:04:43.160 --> 01:04:44.070
Do not touch me.

01:04:44.920 --> 01:04:46.797
If I start to scream and all
Walkers will reapply the corner.

01:04:47.120 --> 01:04:48.030
If you scream...

01:04:48.280 --> 01:04:49.269
People die every second.

01:04:49.800 --> 01:04:52.439
So better shut up!

01:05:19.920 --> 01:05:20.830
Remove your belt!

01:06:04.280 --> 01:06:05.190
Whore!

01:06:10.960 --> 01:06:11.870
Wait! No!
Do not leave me here!

01:07:25.600 --> 01:07:26.510
Give your gun!

01:07:26.960 --> 01:07:27.870
Give it to me! Unlock the gate.

01:07:28.160 --> 01:07:29.070
Get A Life!

01:07:29.840 --> 01:07:30.750
Open the damn gate!

01:07:38.840 --> 01:07:40.034
What happened?

01:07:40.280 --> 01:07:41.349
They can walk now,
We have to go.

01:07:41.600 --> 01:07:43.477
Who can run? Quiet!

01:07:43.720 --> 01:07:45.711
Walkers  This is shit!
They walk, they run shit!

01:07:46.320 --> 01:07:47.639
Quiet!

01:07:47.840 --> 01:07:48.875
Stop Tweet!

01:07:49.120 --> 01:07:50.997
What happened?
Where is this blood?

01:07:51.960 --> 01:07:53.916
This is Tommy.

01:07:54.760 --> 01:07:56.352
I was in a ballad, and he followed me.

01:07:57.160 --> 01:07:58.388
And he said...

01:07:58.640 --> 01:08:00.039
He will kill me if I do not let...

01:08:00.360 --> 01:08:01.270
Fuck me.

01:08:02.040 --> 01:08:03.075
I killed him!

01:08:03.320 --> 01:08:05.629
I killed him and he gets up and he started to run
!

01:08:13.440 --> 01:08:14.350
What would I do?

01:08:16.359 --> 01:08:17.270
I'll get Rachel.

01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:19.194
There is a boat at the dock,

01:08:19.439 --> 01:08:20.555
but I'm afraid that Kurt wanted
prevent us going!

01:08:20.760 --> 01:08:21.670
I'll talk to Kurt.

01:08:22.200 --> 01:08:23.474
This will prevent us from going,
you have to kill him.

01:08:23.720 --> 01:08:24.709
Stop! Quiet!

01:08:25.240 --> 01:08:26.149
Everything will be fine.

01:08:26.600 --> 01:08:28.875
Rachel Take and find ourselves after.

01:08:29.080 --> 01:08:30.194
OK, let's go.

01:08:52.840 --> 01:08:54.716
Zankou Chicken ,
too good, I promise!

01:08:55.200 --> 01:08:56.917
Armenia fashionable Bake with garlic sauce,

01:08:57.120 --> 01:08:58.154
, the gay little olive oil...

01:08:58.399 --> 01:08:59.879
You keep talking and I make the chicken skin in your field!

01:09:09.240 --> 01:09:10.559
Should we go! Quick!
Come on, move!

01:09:10.800 --> 01:09:11.788
, Very moving!

01:09:12.600 --> 01:09:14.192
Go, start, fast
! Here we go!

01:09:40.920 --> 01:09:41.830
My God, what...

01:09:43.080 --> 01:09:44.194
- Let's go.
- What?

01:09:44.640 --> 01:09:45.550
You take a boat and we're shooting ourselves.

01:09:47.880 --> 01:09:48.790
Now?

01:09:49.040 --> 01:09:49.995
The Walkers have passed through the gates.

01:09:50.319 --> 01:09:51.229
Quick!

01:09:51.439 --> 01:09:52.872
We have to leave the island.

01:09:54.480 --> 01:09:55.390
Go Rachel must go!

01:10:07.920 --> 01:10:09.399
OK, Sanz, you come with me.

01:10:11.880 --> 01:10:13.233
Do not leave the others.

01:10:29.960 --> 01:10:30.870
His heart!

01:10:33.120 --> 01:10:34.030
Do not move.

01:10:36.240 --> 01:10:37.150
Stay here!

01:10:38.480 --> 01:10:39.390
You should, you hear?

01:10:41.200 --> 01:10:42.633
Mike!
Maintain west gate!

01:10:43.560 --> 01:10:44.470
We went?

01:10:44.800 --> 01:10:45.710
Let's go!

01:10:56.360 --> 01:10:57.270
There is one there! Your Home!

01:10:58.280 --> 01:10:59.190
I reload my pistol!

01:12:26.840 --> 01:12:27.750
Lord God!

01:12:28.400 --> 01:12:29.310
Drive!

01:13:08.040 --> 01:13:08.950
Quick!

01:13:12.560 --> 01:13:13.470
Wait, wait!

01:13:13.840 --> 01:13:14.750
Herein!

01:13:34.400 --> 01:13:35.310
Coast. Let's go.

01:13:50.160 --> 01:13:51.513
Changing the head! Rise!

01:14:10.640 --> 01:14:11.550
Damn! Continues! Go! Go!

01:14:18.360 --> 01:14:19.270
It's going to go?

01:14:30.400 --> 01:14:31.435
OK?

01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:36.035
The island is cursed!

01:14:36.440 --> 01:14:37.395
Should get the hell!

01:14:39.280 --> 01:14:40.269
What is it?

01:14:41.760 --> 01:14:42.715
A boat.

01:14:44.440 --> 01:14:45.714
Give it to Rachel.

01:14:46.280 --> 01:14:47.349
He knows what to do.

01:14:52.920 --> 01:14:54.069
I take the teeth!

01:14:58.720 --> 01:14:59.948
Out of the island!

01:15:06.040 --> 01:15:07.075
Before I catch up!

01:15:08.440 --> 01:15:09.395
Courage, Rachel! Coming!

01:15:10.520 --> 01:15:11.714
Follow me, Rachel!

01:15:20.360 --> 01:15:21.270
Rachel, come!

01:15:23.760 --> 01:15:24.670
Quick! Rachel!

01:15:29.800 --> 01:15:30.994
Rachel!

01:17:41.680 --> 01:17:42.954
O Lord!

01:17:47.200 --> 01:17:48.997
I'm sorry!

01:17:49.200 --> 01:17:51.794
I'm sorry!

01:17:54.640 --> 01:17:55.959
It's going to go?

01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:08.989
OK, listen...

01:18:09.240 --> 01:18:11.117
There are more than five hundred yards from the pier.

01:18:11.480 --> 01:18:12.549
I will bring the Walkers elsewhere.

01:18:12.920 --> 01:18:14.672
And I'm going back to the boat. Okay?

01:18:19.880 --> 01:18:21.677
Go!

01:18:37.800 --> 01:18:38.710
Way! Coming!

01:19:39.240 --> 01:19:40.150
Tweeter, reducing the up!

01:21:13.240 --> 01:21:14.719
Rachel there is a serious tweeter.

01:21:20.800 --> 01:21:21.710
My name is Beth!
