WEBVTT

00:01.000 --> 00:02.300
What's the matter?

00:02.300 --> 00:04.700
Her heart rate started
racing. She's waking up.

00:05.200 --> 00:07.100
You should know that I'm a survivor, too.

00:07.100 --> 00:08.000
When I tell you that I know

00:08.000 --> 00:10.000
what you're going through, I mean it.

00:10.000 --> 00:11.400
Tony, we're inclined to discharge you,

00:11.400 --> 00:14.000
but you'll have to go to family-counseling
sessions with your father.

00:14.000 --> 00:16.300
I was in juvie with Edgar,
and he said I should reach out.

00:16.300 --> 00:17.800
Hey, you're good with Edgar,
which means you're good with me.

00:17.800 --> 00:19.100
I got your back, all right?

00:19.200 --> 00:21.200
What's up with your brother?
Boy's a little juvie punk.

00:21.200 --> 00:22.800
- Bitch, are you crazy?!
- Ow!

00:22.800 --> 00:24.500
- IdÃ©jala! Let her go!
- Stop!

00:24.500 --> 00:26.700
The only thing you really have
right now is Hector's testimony.

00:26.700 --> 00:28.100
'Cause you don't got... else on this Carter

00:28.100 --> 00:29.600
except what I tell you.

00:29.600 --> 00:31.700
My son was targeted because of his race.

00:31.700 --> 00:33.400
It'd be a challenge
to use that to prove bias.

00:33.400 --> 00:35.900
That man needs to be convicted
for what he did to us.

00:35.900 --> 00:38.500
The proof of Mr.
Nix's guilt is not as evident

00:38.500 --> 00:41.100
as when the court determined
bail was not appropriate.

00:41.100 --> 00:43.200
I am setting bail at $1 million.

00:44.900 --> 00:46.400
I've got a rental car.

00:46.400 --> 00:48.900
It's about 1,000 miles from
here to the Canadian border.

00:48.900 --> 00:51.100
So, are you coming, or are you staying?

00:52.000 --> 00:54.000
That's the dude who ripped
me off! Beat his ass!

00:54.000 --> 00:55.300
Carter!

00:56.500 --> 00:58.200
They're going to go to the police.

00:58.200 --> 00:59.900
They're not going to the police.

01:01.000 --> 01:03.600
Wake her up! Wake her up!

01:03.600 --> 01:05.300
Aubry!

01:08.600 --> 01:10.900
I am so...

01:12.900 --> 01:17.500
fed up with the apologies, the mistakes.

01:17.500 --> 01:21.100
Every step of the way, you've...
You let that man go.

01:21.100 --> 01:22.700
You let him out, and he ran.

01:22.700 --> 01:24.300
What did you think he was gonna do?

01:24.300 --> 01:26.100
I begged you.

01:26.100 --> 01:28.200
I begged you to do everything you could...

01:28.200 --> 01:30.600
And you
acted like I was hysterical.

01:30.700 --> 01:34.000
He obviously had help. He...
he had help getting away.

01:34.000 --> 01:35.900
What are you doing about
the people who helped him?

01:37.000 --> 01:39.900
Do something before he hurts someone else,

01:39.900 --> 01:42.500
before he kills someone else.

01:43.000 --> 01:45.600
Do your jobs!

02:12.000 --> 02:13.500
Is this legal?

02:13.500 --> 02:15.000
It's signed by a judge.

02:15.000 --> 02:16.700
Is what they did legal?

02:16.800 --> 02:18.300
They had probable cause.

02:18.300 --> 02:19.800
To just tear through here?

02:19.800 --> 02:21.700
In the eyes of the court, Carter fleeing...

02:21.700 --> 02:22.400
"Eyes of the court."

02:22.500 --> 02:25.100
Fleeing from bail makes him look guilty.

02:25.100 --> 02:27.000
What about the bail money?

02:27.900 --> 02:29.800
It's forfeited.

02:31.300 --> 02:34.300
I go to the temple and tell
people they lost their money.

02:34.600 --> 02:39.100
I told him what would happen
if he ran, who he would hurt...

02:39.100 --> 02:41.700
And all they could do
was just call me Doreen.

02:42.100 --> 02:43.800
He's living eight years in the past

02:43.800 --> 02:47.500
and just s-slipping further and
further away every second!

02:47.500 --> 02:49.500
I mean, does he want to die?

02:50.200 --> 02:52.000
Am I supposed to just let him go?!

02:53.600 --> 02:55.900
Will she testify against him?

02:55.900 --> 02:57.100
Who?

02:57.200 --> 02:59.500
The girl. His girlfriend.

02:59.500 --> 03:00.600
It's not his girlfriend.

03:00.600 --> 03:03.600
It's just s-someone to get high with.

03:05.300 --> 03:07.200
The prosecutors are going to try to use her.

03:07.200 --> 03:08.700
That's their only way forward.

03:08.700 --> 03:11.500
Wash her up, comb her pretty blonde hair,

03:11.500 --> 03:13.900
and entice her to speak against him.

03:14.900 --> 03:17.700
I have to see my brother.

03:17.700 --> 03:19.000
He has a court appearance scheduled.

03:19.000 --> 03:20.800
You can't see him until then.

03:23.700 --> 03:24.900
He got away?

03:25.000 --> 03:26.600
- No, sir.
- No, y... you said he escaped.

03:26.600 --> 03:27.900
He attempted to flee jurisdiction.

03:27.900 --> 03:28.800
But I don't... I don't understand.

03:28.800 --> 03:30.100
He... The ankle bracelet,

03:30.100 --> 03:31.900
- I mean, that was on a monitor, right?
- We apprehended him last night.

03:31.900 --> 03:32.900
I mean, this is unbelievable.

03:32.900 --> 03:34.500
- He cut it off.
- Well, why even put it on?

03:34.500 --> 03:36.100
I m... He killed somebody?

03:36.100 --> 03:38.100
There was an assault. It wasn't a murder.

03:38.100 --> 03:41.300
Oh, and that's good?
You're proud of that? Huh?

03:41.300 --> 03:43.900
I mean, are we safe? My whole
family is up here right now.

03:43.900 --> 03:45.600
He's in custody now.

03:45.600 --> 03:47.600
You, your family... You should be fine.

03:47.600 --> 03:50.800
The guy who killed my son
is running around the city?

03:50.800 --> 03:52.600
How the hell are we fine?

03:53.200 --> 03:55.200
I mean, it's unbeliev... you...
What are you all doing, huh?

03:55.200 --> 03:56.600
What are you doing?

03:58.900 --> 04:00.800
Just... just tell me what happened.

04:00.800 --> 04:02.700
If you won't tell me, <i>mija...</i>

04:03.200 --> 04:04.500
All right, well, we'll just...

04:04.500 --> 04:06.800
Just get in the car and let
me take you to the doctor.

04:08.800 --> 04:10.900
Why won't you talk to me?

04:10.900 --> 04:14.000
Mija, are you afraid? Did Carlos do this?

04:14.000 --> 04:17.000
Huh? That little punk? Did he?

04:18.700 --> 04:19.500
Jenny.

04:19.500 --> 04:20.200
Jenny, wait.

04:20.200 --> 04:22.400
- Jenny!
- Papi, just leave it.

04:23.400 --> 04:25.600
- Wait up!
- What?!

04:26.400 --> 04:28.500
- Was it Carlos?
- Stop it.

04:28.500 --> 04:29.700
I just want to help.

04:29.700 --> 04:31.400
You couldn't even handle your own business,

04:31.400 --> 04:32.500
but you're gonna help me?

04:32.500 --> 04:33.900
We always talk. Always.

04:33.900 --> 04:35.300
When I went to see you at juvie,

04:35.300 --> 04:37.900
your face was all messed up
and you didn't say anything.

04:37.900 --> 04:38.700
Huh?

04:38.800 --> 04:41.600
And you're giving out our car to
that banger, lie about it...

04:41.600 --> 04:42.300
I didn't lie to you.

04:42.300 --> 04:44.100
Now you want me to talk to you?

04:44.800 --> 04:47.100
Stay here. Go to counseling with <i>Papi.</i>

04:47.100 --> 04:50.000
Get yourself together. Leave me alone.

04:53.700 --> 04:56.300
Crazy, man. It's straight crazy.

04:56.900 --> 04:58.700
Dude gets loose.

04:58.700 --> 05:01.600
All he's got to do is roll on out of here.

05:01.600 --> 05:04.100
Can't even keep himself clean that long.

05:04.100 --> 05:06.300
Brothers, man, they always bitch...

05:06.300 --> 05:08.100
How a brother can't get a break.

05:08.100 --> 05:11.800
They let his ass go, cuts
a dude, O.D.s his girl.

05:11.800 --> 05:13.300
I didn't do nothing,

05:13.300 --> 05:15.600
but I'm the one still stuck in here.

05:15.600 --> 05:17.400
Prosecutors want to talk to you.

05:17.400 --> 05:20.800
Hell, yeah, they want to
talk to me. Now they do.

05:21.100 --> 05:22.500
How bad, huh?

05:22.500 --> 05:25.200
- Very badly.
- Real damn bad.

05:25.500 --> 05:28.100
Delaying extradition's on the table.

05:29.500 --> 05:32.600
Delaying? That was then.

05:32.600 --> 05:34.300
Right now, that's just where things start.

05:34.300 --> 05:37.200
If they want Carter, come at me correct.

05:37.200 --> 05:39.000
Ain't nothing for free.

05:39.000 --> 05:41.700
Do you have something to tell them?

05:42.400 --> 05:44.600
Whatever you tell me is in confidence.

05:44.600 --> 05:46.800
The county fights the feds on extradition...

05:46.800 --> 05:47.700
That is a fight.

05:47.700 --> 05:50.100
That's a fight for them, understand?

05:50.300 --> 05:51.600
They stir up some bad blood,

05:51.600 --> 05:53.500
you need to have something to say.

05:56.800 --> 05:58.700
Get them in here.

05:58.700 --> 06:01.800
Sit their pale asses down,
and let's get to crackin'.

06:20.400 --> 06:22.000
You're back.

06:23.000 --> 06:24.900
Told you you'd be back.

06:37.700 --> 06:40.200
Losing a son like that must be difficult.

06:40.200 --> 06:43.100
What made you want to come
forward to talk about this?

06:43.100 --> 06:45.600
My hope is that with more awareness,

06:45.600 --> 06:47.700
we can get justice for Matt.

06:47.700 --> 06:51.100
He was a good son, a war veteran, a husband,

06:51.800 --> 06:56.300
a man taken from his family in
a horrible, unnecessary way.

06:56.300 --> 06:58.900
And for 24 hours, the man
accused of killing your son,

06:58.900 --> 07:02.100
he escaped from police, he was on the run.

07:02.500 --> 07:04.900
The system didn't work. It's that simple.

07:04.900 --> 07:06.700
Some people have said race is playing a part

07:06.700 --> 07:08.100
in what's happening now.

07:08.400 --> 07:11.600
Not from us. Not from my family.

07:11.900 --> 07:15.100
I-I have always been... and I
think I taught my children...

07:15.100 --> 07:18.100
to be open-minded, to respect everyone.

07:18.100 --> 07:20.000
My younger son, Mark, he's marrying a girl

07:20.000 --> 07:23.200
in the military, and she
happens to be an Asian.

07:23.200 --> 07:25.000
Some people have alleged that your son

07:25.000 --> 07:27.700
may have been killed because
he was involved in drugs.

07:27.700 --> 07:29.100
What does that matter?

07:29.100 --> 07:31.900
Even if it were true, that
makes it okay to murder someone?

07:31.900 --> 07:35.200
If he were on drugs, it's
okay that my son was murdered?

07:35.200 --> 07:38.200
You read all the time
about a... black person

07:38.200 --> 07:39.800
who's actually a criminal.

07:39.800 --> 07:44.700
They get shot by the police.
People lose their minds.

07:44.700 --> 07:49.100
A good white kid gets
murdered in his home, well...

07:51.500 --> 07:52.400
That's okay

07:52.400 --> 07:55.400
because maybe he smoked
a joint on the weekends.

07:55.800 --> 07:57.300
Hmm.

07:59.300 --> 08:02.400
You were good. You were really strong.

08:06.300 --> 08:08.800
You should see the comments on your website.

08:08.800 --> 08:10.300
- Oh.
- The reaction...

08:14.800 --> 08:16.500
You're tired.

08:16.500 --> 08:18.300
You should relax for a minute.

08:18.900 --> 08:21.900
Is there anybody you can go
and have a glass of wine with?

08:21.900 --> 08:23.200
Your son?

08:23.200 --> 08:25.900
Mm. Would you want to?

08:26.300 --> 08:28.100
I can't tonight. I have to go.

08:28.100 --> 08:29.500
Oh, you told me.

08:30.100 --> 08:32.200
You get these little rituals.

08:32.600 --> 08:34.600
They help... some.

08:36.900 --> 08:38.299
Get some rest.

08:39.799 --> 08:41.299
Thank you.

08:41.799 --> 08:43.500
And thank you.

08:49.700 --> 08:50.800
How much would it have cost

08:50.800 --> 08:53.100
to have a cop sitting outside
his door watching him?

08:53.100 --> 08:54.100
Huh? You know, I always thought

08:54.100 --> 08:55.700
that if you cut one of those things off,

08:55.700 --> 08:57.800
there are alarms or something,
somebody gets notified.

08:57.800 --> 09:00.000
And it's frightening knowing
that he was out there.

09:00.000 --> 09:01.600
He... he could have done anything.

09:01.600 --> 09:03.400
And I...

09:03.400 --> 09:04.700
I hate to say it. Your mom was right.

09:04.700 --> 09:06.900
She was... She was right about this.

09:07.100 --> 09:08.400
And that bothers you?

09:08.400 --> 09:10.600
Well, I'm just, uh,
acknowledging she was right.

09:10.600 --> 09:13.300
I got some locks from work.

09:13.300 --> 09:14.000
Locks?

09:14.000 --> 09:15.900
Yeah, you know, I'm just
gonna maybe put a few extra

09:15.900 --> 09:17.700
- of them up around the place.
- This is a rental.

09:17.700 --> 09:19.700
I don't think they'd appreciate
you putting locks up.

09:19.700 --> 09:21.300
Well, I get a discount from the store.

09:21.300 --> 09:23.000
- Russ, I don't need them.
- I mean, your... your fiancÃ©e...

09:23.000 --> 09:25.000
Your fiancÃ©e's coming up here, right?

09:25.000 --> 09:26.400
I mean, you... you want things safe for her?

09:26.400 --> 09:27.900
What would it hurt to just take a swing

09:27.900 --> 09:31.100
around the place and, you
know, try to make things safe?

09:34.100 --> 09:35.600
I'm not doing this.

09:35.600 --> 09:37.400
Doing what?

09:38.800 --> 09:41.600
Pretending that everything
is cool between us.

09:42.800 --> 09:44.200
This is killing me, Russ.

09:44.200 --> 09:45.600
- Mark...
- The only reason I am here,

09:45.600 --> 09:48.800
I'm doing clean-up for Matt,
for what he did to Gwen.

09:48.800 --> 09:51.000
He screwed that girl's life up.

09:52.400 --> 09:53.900
Don't... don't blame it all on your brother.

09:53.900 --> 09:55.900
Oh, I'm not. I'm not. It's not just him.

09:56.600 --> 09:58.200
Hell, no. It's you. It's mom.

09:58.200 --> 09:59.600
It's... It's the whole family.

09:59.600 --> 10:00.800
I know.

10:00.800 --> 10:02.300
Yeah, I was a bad father. I was.

10:02.300 --> 10:04.100
And you have every right...

10:04.100 --> 10:06.000
Oh, God. Come on. Stop.

10:06.000 --> 10:08.200
You know, but I-I-I come here
to help. You don't want it.

10:09.100 --> 10:11.700
You know, I admit I messed up,
Mark, and you don't listen.

10:11.700 --> 10:14.000
- So...
- Well, now it's too late.

10:14.000 --> 10:14.800
No, not now.

10:14.800 --> 10:17.200
I... I mean all those years.

10:17.200 --> 10:20.800
I reached out. We talked all the time.

10:21.200 --> 10:23.500
A phone call once a week.

10:23.500 --> 10:26.900
I tried. I'm still trying.

10:27.800 --> 10:29.800
By suing mom over Matt's body,

10:29.800 --> 10:32.800
by coming here and putting
discount locks on my doors.

10:32.800 --> 10:36.100
I mean, it's the same obsessive-compuls...

10:36.100 --> 10:38.300
You gambling again, Russ?

10:40.900 --> 10:43.400
No, I'm not gambling.

10:44.800 --> 10:47.100
Well, you're sure as
hell acting like you are.

10:57.800 --> 10:59.700
What do you want me to do?

11:04.500 --> 11:06.800
I want... I want you to go.

11:14.500 --> 11:16.800
After this, for you and me...

11:17.900 --> 11:19.500
What do you want me to do...

11:19.500 --> 11:21.500
I want you to live your life.

11:22.700 --> 11:24.600
That's what I'm doing with mine.

11:46.000 --> 11:47.000
Hey.

11:47.600 --> 11:49.000
How are you?

11:49.500 --> 11:51.500
Hmm? How am I?

11:51.500 --> 11:53.700
Yeah.

11:55.500 --> 11:57.200
But you look strong.

11:58.200 --> 11:59.600
You look good.

11:59.800 --> 12:01.200
You look well.

12:03.900 --> 12:07.600
Hey, I've been following this
case you're involved with.

12:07.600 --> 12:10.500
Oh. What's on TV,
that's just the half of it.

12:11.400 --> 12:14.700
The prosecutors, the police, they are...

12:16.200 --> 12:18.800
If I thought they were incompetent before...

12:19.700 --> 12:22.400
They are putting this woman,
her family through...

12:22.400 --> 12:24.900
But what are you... what are
you putting yourself through?

12:25.000 --> 12:26.900
Oh, don't. Don't do it.

12:26.900 --> 12:28.400
- Don't do it. Not today.
- You do this. You torture yourself.

12:28.400 --> 12:30.100
Come on. You know you do.

12:33.300 --> 12:35.200
Hey. It's... Listen, I'm...

12:36.400 --> 12:39.400
It's just... today of all days.

12:40.000 --> 12:41.800
I mean, all days,

12:42.000 --> 12:45.200
you put yourself through
this pain with strangers?

12:46.200 --> 12:48.300
Um...

12:54.200 --> 12:57.300
How I see it, if we're gonna talk about it,

12:58.100 --> 13:00.300
you walked away.

13:02.100 --> 13:04.900
You walked away from what happened to us.

13:05.800 --> 13:06.900
Do you remember that feeling

13:06.900 --> 13:09.200
when the police had no answers for us?

13:09.900 --> 13:11.900
When the defense dragged
us through the streets?

13:11.900 --> 13:13.300
I know. I know.

13:13.300 --> 13:15.600
I live with that every day.

13:16.100 --> 13:18.300
It's still with me, the bang of the gavel

13:18.300 --> 13:22.600
when they gave that man
15 years for what they...

13:23.100 --> 13:24.600
I know.

13:24.600 --> 13:27.400
And I know you want to help other people.

13:27.400 --> 13:28.600
I know.

13:28.600 --> 13:32.400
But this lady says things
in public that are just...

13:32.400 --> 13:33.800
Can you blame her?

13:34.400 --> 13:37.500
I sit with her and listen to the excuses

13:37.500 --> 13:38.700
and watch her melt.

13:38.700 --> 13:40.200
A-a-and... And there's a difference

13:40.200 --> 13:44.500
between grieving and getting ugly.

13:44.900 --> 13:48.100
What I saw her saying on television, I...

13:49.400 --> 13:51.900
I don't want you putting yourself in a place

13:51.900 --> 13:53.300
- where you have to defend things...
- I'm not putting myself through anything.

13:53.300 --> 13:54.500
I choose to do this.

13:54.500 --> 13:56.300
Defend things you don't believe in.

13:56.300 --> 13:58.300
She's not you.

14:00.700 --> 14:03.000
That's all I'm trying to say.

14:03.500 --> 14:05.100
She's not you.

14:11.400 --> 14:12.800
Hmm.

14:20.000 --> 14:20.800
I love you.

14:20.800 --> 14:21.800
I love you, too.

14:21.900 --> 14:23.800
- I'll always love you.
- Always love you.

14:23.800 --> 14:25.400
- Same time.
- Next year.

14:25.400 --> 14:26.300
Next year.

14:39.700 --> 14:41.000
What's going on? Where is he?

14:41.000 --> 14:42.600
He's not scheduled for this judge.

14:42.600 --> 14:43.600
You said he had an appearance.

14:43.600 --> 14:44.800
Sometimes they shuffle cases.

14:44.800 --> 14:47.700
Depends on the judges in session,
the number of dockets.

14:47.700 --> 14:49.200
After what they say he did,

14:49.200 --> 14:51.600
they're just going to shuffle his case?

14:52.400 --> 14:54.300
Are they playing games?

14:54.300 --> 14:56.100
I don't know.

14:56.600 --> 14:58.800
Then find out.

14:59.400 --> 15:02.500
It was tough, but I did my best.

15:02.500 --> 15:05.200
I always did what I thought was best.

15:05.800 --> 15:10.300
But, um, Roberta, she... she was better...

15:12.600 --> 15:14.200
It's okay.

15:14.400 --> 15:16.100
Um...

15:16.600 --> 15:17.800
Anyway, after she passed,

15:17.800 --> 15:20.700
I-I would bring Tony to the shop with me.

15:20.700 --> 15:23.400
It was hard sometimes to get a sitter.

15:24.000 --> 15:27.000
- And where would Jenny be?
- At her uncle's.

15:27.000 --> 15:28.100
I didn't think it was a good idea

15:28.100 --> 15:31.500
for a young girl to be
around auto-shop guys.

15:32.700 --> 15:35.100
Do you think that made her feel neglected?

15:35.400 --> 15:37.700
No. No, I never neglected her.

15:37.700 --> 15:40.800
But do you think... do you think
it made her <i>feel</i> neglected?

15:40.800 --> 15:43.700
I mean, she doesn't come here with you.

15:43.700 --> 15:47.100
She's a teenage girl.
You know how that is.

15:49.000 --> 15:51.200
What about Tony? What...
what about raising Tony?

15:51.200 --> 15:53.400
Oh, he was always by my side.

15:53.400 --> 15:58.100
And, uh... later on, he started to pitch in,

15:58.100 --> 15:59.400
and then we thought it would be good

15:59.400 --> 16:01.200
to have something to do together, you know,

16:01.200 --> 16:03.100
so I-I got this old car,

16:04.500 --> 16:07.100
and we worked on it all the time.

16:07.400 --> 16:10.000
It, uh... it was fun to be together.

16:10.000 --> 16:11.400
When you hear your father speak about

16:11.400 --> 16:14.000
how much he misses doing things with you,

16:14.000 --> 16:15.900
how does that make you feel?

16:16.700 --> 16:17.900
Good.

16:17.900 --> 16:19.100
Well, do you think you might
be able to find some time

16:19.100 --> 16:23.400
to spend with him, just the
two of you, maybe this weekend?

16:24.100 --> 16:25.400
Sure.

16:28.100 --> 16:30.300
Is there something on your mind?

16:31.300 --> 16:32.300
We've heard your father speak,

16:32.300 --> 16:35.600
but is there... is there
anything you want to say?

16:36.700 --> 16:37.400
Jenny doesn't come

16:37.400 --> 16:39.000
'cause she hardly wants to be home anymore.

16:39.000 --> 16:39.800
Antonio.

16:39.800 --> 16:42.100
Ever since he got me arrested,
things have been bad.

16:42.200 --> 16:44.600
- I did not get him arrested.
- L-let him speak, please.

16:44.600 --> 16:47.400
We got kicked out of church, and
someone tagged on his garage.

16:47.500 --> 16:48.700
And my sister's hurt or something.

16:48.700 --> 16:50.400
He doesn't help her. He just yells at her.

16:50.400 --> 16:52.900
- Wait. Wait. You wait a minute!
- Mr. GutiÃ©rrez, please.

16:53.600 --> 16:55.600
Something's going on with my sister,

16:55.600 --> 16:57.500
and I want to know what's up with her.

16:57.500 --> 16:58.500
And all he wants to do

16:58.500 --> 17:00.700
is talk about the stuff we used to do.

17:06.000 --> 17:08.900
Mija, entiendo si no quieres
hablar de lo que pasÃ³,

17:09.000 --> 17:12.099
<i>pero acuÃ©rdate que somos su familia.</i>

17:12.099 --> 17:14.900
<i>La familia ya tiene muchas problemas.</i>

17:15.099 --> 17:17.400
La familia no tienen problemas, <i>mija.</i>

17:17.599 --> 17:21.400
El cabrÃ³n que ti hizo eso,
Ã©l sÃ­ tiene problemas.

17:21.400 --> 17:22.900
<i>MontÃ³n de problemas.</i>

17:22.900 --> 17:25.700
<i>Por favor.</i> <i>Â¿Podemos hablar de otras cosa?</i>

17:26.599 --> 17:28.700
<i>Si quieres.</i>

17:31.400 --> 17:33.100
<i>Â¿Me das una?</i>

17:33.800 --> 17:36.900
<i>Â¿QuÃ©, quÃ©? Una quÃ©?</i> <i>Â¿Una chela?</i>

17:36.900 --> 17:38.500
- <i>SÃ­.</i>
- <i>No creo yo.</i>

17:38.500 --> 17:41.200
<i>Â¿Por quÃ© no?</i> <i>Yo tomÃ³ cerveza.</i>

17:41.600 --> 17:43.400
Pues entonces ya conoces <i>el sabor.</i>

17:43.400 --> 17:45.200
No te tienes que echar una, <i>Â¿no?</i>

17:45.200 --> 17:46.300
Ay, ay, ay.

17:46.300 --> 17:48.100
Eh...

17:48.800 --> 17:49.900
Don't lie to me.

17:49.900 --> 17:51.800
- Do not sit there and lie to my face.
- Look, I am trying to help you,

17:51.800 --> 17:54.000
- but you need to keep calm.
- I was at the downtown jail,

17:54.000 --> 17:55.900
- and they said the same thing.
- He is most likely still in processing

17:55.900 --> 17:57.500
- or just left processing.
- If he's not there and he's not here,

17:57.500 --> 17:58.600
then where is he?

18:07.700 --> 18:09.600
No one is
interrogating your daughter.

18:09.600 --> 18:11.400
So why does this have to happen now?

18:11.400 --> 18:13.200
Your daughter is the only eyewitness.

18:13.200 --> 18:16.300
If she can identify Carter, it
guarantees us a conviction.

18:16.300 --> 18:17.900
You just arrested him for fleeing.

18:17.900 --> 18:19.400
He just ran off!

18:19.400 --> 18:21.100
Those charges can only be added

18:21.100 --> 18:22.800
if he's convicted of the original crime.

18:22.800 --> 18:23.900
I don't understand any of this.

18:23.900 --> 18:25.000
Can you please explain what's going on?

18:25.000 --> 18:27.300
Look, we are trying to get a conviction.

18:27.500 --> 18:28.700
And the best way for us to do that

18:28.700 --> 18:30.300
is with a statement from Gwen.

18:30.300 --> 18:32.600
You have not told us the truth once.

18:33.100 --> 18:34.900
Not once.

18:36.000 --> 18:37.300
And the only reason you're here

18:37.300 --> 18:39.300
is because you've all
made a joke of this case,

18:39.300 --> 18:41.600
and now Gwen's the only one who can fix it.

18:43.000 --> 18:44.900
That's the truth, isn't it?

18:45.400 --> 18:46.600
I think it would help her to know

18:46.600 --> 18:48.500
that the man who hurt her is in jail

18:48.500 --> 18:50.900
doing life or facing execution.

18:59.200 --> 19:01.600
Gwen, could you please state
your full legal name for me?

19:02.100 --> 19:03.900
Skokie.

19:04.700 --> 19:06.300
Um...

19:07.600 --> 19:10.500
Gwendolyn Elizabeth Skokie.

19:10.900 --> 19:13.100
Okay. I'm gonna ask you a few questions.

19:13.100 --> 19:14.200
Is that all right?

19:14.400 --> 19:16.200
- Yes.
- All right.

19:16.200 --> 19:17.800
Do you know where you are right now?

19:18.600 --> 19:21.200
With nurses.

19:21.800 --> 19:24.700
Uh, in... in the hospital.

19:25.900 --> 19:27.600
Do you know why you're here?

19:27.600 --> 19:29.000
What happened to you?

19:31.600 --> 19:33.400
I got hurt.

19:34.400 --> 19:36.700
And your husband was killed.

19:39.400 --> 19:40.900
Yes.

19:40.900 --> 19:43.600
Okay, I want to ask you
about how you got hurt.

19:45.900 --> 19:49.400
Now, I have six photos here.

19:49.400 --> 19:51.800
You tell me if you recognize

19:51.800 --> 19:54.100
any of the men in these pictures.

19:54.600 --> 19:56.800
No.

19:56.800 --> 19:58.500
You don't recognize any of them?

19:58.500 --> 19:59.600
No.

20:01.200 --> 20:04.100
Do you know a man named Carter Nix?

20:06.200 --> 20:07.900
Uh...

20:08.200 --> 20:12.000
I-I don't know people named Carter.

20:12.800 --> 20:16.300
Did your husband have any
previous contact with him?

20:18.300 --> 20:20.500
I'm not sure.

20:20.600 --> 20:21.900
Maybe.

20:23.700 --> 20:27.500
Could you try to think back
to the morning of the attack?

20:34.700 --> 20:36.600
Um...

20:38.800 --> 20:42.700
What was the last thing you
remember about that Sunday?

20:42.700 --> 20:44.900
Sunday...

20:45.700 --> 20:46.900
Um...

20:49.500 --> 20:53.100
We took a trip... Goleta.

20:53.400 --> 20:55.800
We wanted to see the butterf-flies.

20:55.800 --> 20:57.700
That... that was a different Sunday.

20:57.900 --> 21:00.800
That was three weeks before the...

21:01.700 --> 21:03.700
We... we all took that
trip together, remember?

21:03.700 --> 21:05.000
I was driving.

21:05.000 --> 21:07.100
- And Matt was...
- Sick.

21:07.100 --> 21:09.300
Matt was sick.

21:09.700 --> 21:12.700
I was watching you drive us home.

21:13.300 --> 21:17.100
It was like I wanted to be a kid again,

21:18.200 --> 21:20.700
sitting in the backseat.

21:22.600 --> 21:24.700
And then...

21:24.700 --> 21:26.200
After that?

21:28.100 --> 21:30.700
I don't remember after that.

21:30.700 --> 21:32.800
After going to see the butterflies?

21:32.800 --> 21:34.000
Three weeks after that?

21:34.000 --> 21:35.300
No.

21:36.300 --> 21:38.800
I'm in the backseat.

21:38.800 --> 21:41.200
I'm in the car.

21:43.700 --> 21:46.000
That's... that's all.

21:47.000 --> 21:49.000
What... What am I to remember?

21:49.000 --> 21:51.200
Who is Carter Nix?

21:51.200 --> 21:54.300
I don't know. I don't know him!

21:54.300 --> 21:57.400
He was in your house.
What happened that night?

22:00.000 --> 22:01.500
I-I don't know.

22:02.100 --> 22:04.600
Stop! That's enough. Stop.

22:04.600 --> 22:06.100
It's okay. It's enough.

22:06.100 --> 22:08.700
Don't talk. It's over. It's over.

22:12.500 --> 22:14.300
It's okay. You don't need to talk.

22:14.300 --> 22:16.600
No more talking. No more talking.

22:30.500 --> 22:31.900
Everything okay?

22:31.900 --> 22:35.200
Oh. Sorry. Uh... I didn't, um...

22:35.200 --> 22:38.000
I'm invisible. I got that quality.

22:38.700 --> 22:40.000
You still up for swapping drama,

22:40.000 --> 22:41.800
mine's really good at the moment.

22:42.300 --> 22:45.500
Yeah? What's the latest?

22:45.500 --> 22:47.900
I'm pretty sure my son hates me.

22:48.400 --> 22:50.600
Hmm. You know, that's what sons do.

22:50.600 --> 22:51.900
They hate their dads.

22:51.900 --> 22:55.500
It's a complex. They call it something.

22:55.800 --> 22:57.800
They... they call it a something complex?

22:57.900 --> 22:59.600
No.

22:59.600 --> 23:03.700
It's, uh, Oedipus Complex.
I think that's it.

23:04.200 --> 23:06.000
How about you? Kids?

23:06.000 --> 23:08.300
No. I was married once.

23:08.700 --> 23:11.400
- What happened with yours?
- Just broke.

23:11.400 --> 23:13.800
You know, it was working, working, working.

23:13.800 --> 23:17.400
And then one day, it just,
uh... It quit working.

23:17.400 --> 23:18.600
Like a TV.

23:18.600 --> 23:20.100
Like a man.

23:21.000 --> 23:23.900
Honestly, I'm not trying to sound bitter.

23:23.900 --> 23:27.900
He just, uh... you know, he
did his guy thing and took off.

23:27.900 --> 23:29.700
Hmm. Men do that.

23:29.800 --> 23:32.100
Yeah. Why?

23:32.100 --> 23:33.800
- Hmm.
- I mean, where do they all run to?

23:33.800 --> 23:35.800
It's not like they ever
end up anyplace better.

23:35.800 --> 23:37.400
It's usually someplace like...

23:37.400 --> 23:39.200
- Arizona.
- No, it's worse than that.

23:39.200 --> 23:40.300
Usually it's someplace like...

23:40.300 --> 23:42.400
That's where I ended up. Arizona.

23:42.500 --> 23:44.100
You split on your wife?

23:45.000 --> 23:46.900
Split, got kicked out.

23:50.300 --> 23:53.200
So, uh, what other drama do you have?

23:53.900 --> 23:55.800
- You ready?
- Sure.

23:58.200 --> 24:00.100
My, uh, son...

24:02.100 --> 24:04.900
My... my other son lived here in Modesto.

24:05.400 --> 24:07.100
Uh, he was murdered.

24:07.100 --> 24:11.800
H...His... his wife was
shot in their own house.

24:12.600 --> 24:14.300
Oh, God.

24:17.500 --> 24:19.100
Those two?

24:20.200 --> 24:22.100
They were your family?

24:22.100 --> 24:25.300
I came here to bury one son,

24:25.300 --> 24:27.800
I find out the other one
doesn't want me around.

24:28.400 --> 24:29.300
That's what messed me up.

24:29.300 --> 24:31.900
Not that he thinks I'm a lousy dad.

24:31.900 --> 24:33.800
Um...

24:35.100 --> 24:37.400
That he thinks I'd give up on him.

24:39.700 --> 24:41.400
Ran once.

24:43.500 --> 24:45.400
Not running again.

24:47.600 --> 24:51.800
I... I got to, uh... I got
to get back out on the floor.

24:57.600 --> 25:00.100
Oh.

25:03.900 --> 25:07.400
I-I need a hit, please.

25:09.700 --> 25:11.200
The rental car.

25:12.400 --> 25:13.900
Was that all you wanted it for?

25:13.900 --> 25:15.300
To get away?

25:15.300 --> 25:16.700
Daddy.

25:18.100 --> 25:19.700
Help me.

25:19.800 --> 25:21.700
- Your N.A. meetings.
- I am dying.

25:21.700 --> 25:23.300
- Was that all crap, too?
- Help me.

25:23.600 --> 25:26.700
The police want to talk to you.
You have to make a deal.

25:26.700 --> 25:29.200
They'll reduce the charges
if you turn on that man.

25:29.900 --> 25:32.400
This is real. You get it?

25:33.300 --> 25:34.600
You cut that man loose.

25:34.600 --> 25:36.300
- Stop it.
- You helped him escape.

25:36.300 --> 25:37.400
S-stop.

25:37.400 --> 25:39.300
They'll send you to prison
if you don't help yourself.

25:39.300 --> 25:40.700
- Oh, stop. I'm sick.
- You have to turn him in.

25:40.700 --> 25:41.700
- I'm so...
- Aubry, listen to me.

25:41.700 --> 25:44.700
- Oh. I'm so sick.
- Let me help you.

25:44.700 --> 25:46.600
Look at what this man's done
to you. Look at yourself.

25:47.500 --> 25:49.600
You've got to turn him in. Listen to me.

25:49.600 --> 25:51.100
Let me help you. Please, Aubry!

25:51.100 --> 25:52.500
Go away.

25:55.200 --> 25:56.400
Go.

25:56.400 --> 25:57.500
Aubry, let me help you.

25:57.500 --> 25:59.100
Get out!

25:59.400 --> 26:00.300
Aubry, please...

26:00.300 --> 26:02.000
- Aubry...
- Get! Get out!

26:02.400 --> 26:04.200
Get out!

26:34.000 --> 26:35.500
I found a judge to meet with.

26:35.600 --> 26:37.000
I'm filing a writ.

26:40.900 --> 26:43.600
I'm filing a writ. They
have to produce the body.

26:44.000 --> 26:46.200
That's just terminology.

26:46.300 --> 26:49.000
I know they're trying to
force a confession out of him.

26:49.000 --> 26:51.700
But if they hurt Carter now,
that would be stupid.

26:53.900 --> 26:56.800
If they hurt him now, then it all goes away.

26:57.800 --> 26:59.700
Their lies, their mistakes.

27:02.200 --> 27:04.500
He wanted a plate of ribs.

27:06.000 --> 27:09.500
If I'd gotten him a plate, sat with him...

27:11.200 --> 27:12.100
All he wanted...

27:12.100 --> 27:14.700
The devil's hand is in this, Aliyah.

27:17.700 --> 27:20.700
He wanted to talk to me as his sister.

27:21.600 --> 27:24.700
All I had to do was be family for him,

27:25.000 --> 27:27.400
and I couldn't even acknowledge that.

27:28.300 --> 27:31.000
So is that the devil or is that me?

27:31.000 --> 27:33.400
All he had to do was not run away.

27:39.900 --> 27:42.800
I expect him to take responsibility.

27:44.400 --> 27:46.400
So I need to take mine.

27:57.900 --> 27:59.300
Sorry.

28:00.900 --> 28:02.400
Didn't mean to wake you.

28:06.100 --> 28:07.700
You better?

28:09.200 --> 28:11.200
Dad said you had it pretty bad.

28:14.900 --> 28:16.800
Here. Let me help.

28:27.100 --> 28:28.400
Here.

28:32.600 --> 28:35.600
Look, I know that this might suck to hear.

28:39.500 --> 28:42.200
But I really think that
you should listen to dad,

28:42.200 --> 28:43.900
talk to the police.

28:44.900 --> 28:48.200
If you help them, if you come clean,

28:48.300 --> 28:50.500
they'll work something out for you.

28:51.700 --> 28:53.700
Come clean.

28:54.500 --> 28:56.300
Get out of here.

28:58.200 --> 29:00.200
Come back home.

29:04.900 --> 29:07.900
That what you want?

29:14.600 --> 29:19.400
Do you really think confessing
will make things better?

29:55.100 --> 29:56.700
- You're okay, though?
- Well...

29:56.700 --> 29:57.600
Everybody's okay?

29:57.600 --> 29:59.800
I don't even know what okay is anymore.

30:00.300 --> 30:01.500
They look you in the face,

30:01.500 --> 30:03.500
they tell you they're handling everything.

30:03.500 --> 30:05.300
It's like you said on TV.

30:05.300 --> 30:07.700
- You saw it?
- I-I saw it online.

30:07.700 --> 30:08.900
But you're right.

30:08.900 --> 30:10.800
The system doesn't help people like us.

30:10.800 --> 30:12.300
It's ridiculous.

30:13.200 --> 30:15.000
What?

30:18.500 --> 30:21.400
My son's fiancÃ©e is coming to Modesto,

30:21.400 --> 30:23.900
so that should be interesting.

30:24.000 --> 30:27.700
Mark said he wasn't even sure
he wanted me to meet her.

30:27.700 --> 30:30.000
He didn't know how I would handle it.

30:30.100 --> 30:31.700
Why would he say that?

30:31.700 --> 30:34.700
Well, because he said
she is a woman of color.

30:34.700 --> 30:36.000
- What?
- Yes.

30:36.900 --> 30:38.900
What does that even mean?

30:38.900 --> 30:40.400
I thought saying "colored people"

30:40.400 --> 30:42.200
was supposed to be offensive.

30:42.600 --> 30:44.200
So she's a black girl?

30:44.200 --> 30:45.400
Asian.

30:45.400 --> 30:46.800
Well, could be worse.

30:46.800 --> 30:49.000
One more person I have to justify myself to.

30:49.000 --> 30:51.500
You don't have to justify anything.

30:52.300 --> 30:58.000
I used to see... grieving mothers on TV

30:58.100 --> 31:01.000
going after whoever they
thought was responsible.

31:01.000 --> 31:02.400
I would think, "I get it.

31:02.400 --> 31:05.500
You're upset, but don't be
crazy. Don't act crazy."

31:06.500 --> 31:08.900
There's nothing crazy about
believing no one cares

31:08.900 --> 31:12.300
as much about my son and
what happened to him as I do.

31:13.000 --> 31:15.200
The police don't. The lawyers don't.

31:15.200 --> 31:17.400
Not even the rest of my family.

31:21.100 --> 31:23.200
So I can just imagine
what people are thinking

31:23.200 --> 31:24.800
when they see me.

31:29.800 --> 31:31.500
So what do you think?

31:31.500 --> 31:34.500
Maybe the chicken sonoma egg scramble?

31:40.100 --> 31:42.700
I... don't know. Could be fun.

31:47.700 --> 31:49.000
If you agree to plea to the charge

31:49.000 --> 31:51.000
of receiving stolen property...

31:51.600 --> 31:54.000
After the court hears your testimony,

31:54.100 --> 31:56.300
you will be released with time served.

31:56.300 --> 31:59.200
Released? Or sent back to Mexico?

31:59.200 --> 32:01.300
You'll avoid deportation
as long as possible.

32:03.000 --> 32:05.000
It's a good deal, Hector.

32:05.500 --> 32:07.600
You need to think about your future.

32:08.000 --> 32:09.400
You shot me.

32:09.900 --> 32:12.300
You stuck me in here, and
I got my face slashed.

32:12.300 --> 32:15.200
But now all of a sudden, you're
worried about my future?

32:16.600 --> 32:17.600
You put out some deal,

32:17.600 --> 32:19.900
and me and my man are
just supposed to take it?

32:20.900 --> 32:23.800
You know, I've got nothing
but time up in here.

32:23.800 --> 32:26.700
Almost three months getting my leg fixed,

32:26.800 --> 32:29.000
getting my face fixed.

32:29.500 --> 32:31.000
I started reading this law book,

32:31.000 --> 32:32.800
but didn't make no sense to me.

32:33.500 --> 32:35.400
So I got to talking to some three-strikers.

32:35.400 --> 32:37.800
Them three-strikers, they know the law.

32:39.200 --> 32:40.600
Hector, it's a good deal.

32:40.600 --> 32:42.300
I want immunity.

32:43.000 --> 32:45.300
I don't want any of this
to come back on me after.

32:45.300 --> 32:47.500
Then I get put in Witness Protection.

32:47.500 --> 32:50.800
I want a clean record. I want a clean start.

32:52.000 --> 32:54.100
Man.

32:54.700 --> 32:55.900
If you had any kind of something,

32:55.900 --> 32:56.900
you wouldn't be sitting there.

32:56.900 --> 32:59.300
All that nonsense Carter pulled on you.

32:59.700 --> 33:01.700
You all look like bitches.

33:02.100 --> 33:04.600
Straight stupid bitches.

33:06.800 --> 33:08.400
You want me to talk on Carter?

33:08.700 --> 33:11.300
I get immunity, Witness Protection,

33:11.300 --> 33:12.900
and drop all that extradition crap,

33:12.900 --> 33:14.600
and you got to show me some love.

33:15.600 --> 33:18.400
I'm not saying nothing until
I know you're for real.

33:19.300 --> 33:21.300
What kind of gesture?

33:25.300 --> 33:27.500
I hate this hellhole.

33:28.000 --> 33:31.000
Get me out and get me
someplace I'm protected.

34:03.800 --> 34:05.300
What's up with Jenny?

34:05.800 --> 34:08.800
She told me to squash it.
I'm not gonna snitch.

34:08.800 --> 34:10.400
This ain't snitching.

34:10.400 --> 34:12.600
It's my sister. Who jumped her?

34:13.600 --> 34:15.500
Was some kid named Joaquin Montoya.

34:15.500 --> 34:17.100
I kind of know him from around school.

34:17.100 --> 34:19.100
He was crushing on your sister some,

34:19.100 --> 34:21.800
and I don't know why, but he smacked her.

34:27.199 --> 34:28.600
Jenny's your girl?

34:29.600 --> 34:31.100
I like her.

34:31.699 --> 34:34.100
A guy beats on her,
and you don't do nothing.

34:34.100 --> 34:35.600
You know who he is.

34:39.000 --> 34:40.400
Stay away from her.

34:54.100 --> 34:55.800
Should never put your hand on bitches.

34:56.199 --> 34:57.900
I don't care what kind of drama they got.

34:58.600 --> 34:59.700
They all got to be treated like people.

34:59.700 --> 35:00.900
You know what I'm saying?

35:01.700 --> 35:03.000
Who's this Joaquin bitch?

35:03.000 --> 35:04.300
I don't know.

35:04.700 --> 35:06.300
Hey, you need to chill out, man.

35:06.800 --> 35:08.100
Drink up.

35:08.100 --> 35:08.800
âª <i>Yes, indeedy</i> âª

35:09.400 --> 35:10.500
Yeah, chill, son.

35:10.500 --> 35:12.300
- We're all friends here.
- Yeah.

35:12.300 --> 35:14.300
Hey, you and my cousin Edgar

35:14.300 --> 35:16.000
have been getting pretty
tight, huh, in juvie?

35:16.000 --> 35:18.000
- Him and me are cool.
- You two on pipe now?

35:18.000 --> 35:19.500
He got you, I got you.

35:20.000 --> 35:22.100
Huh? You two went gay for the stay?

35:22.100 --> 35:23.700
- Huh?
- No, what? No, we didn't.

35:23.700 --> 35:25.200
<i>Primo,</i> dawg. I don't know, man.

35:25.200 --> 35:26.700
I'm just messing with you, kid.

35:27.400 --> 35:29.400
You ever play tap the bottle before, Tony?

35:29.800 --> 35:31.800
No. What's that?

35:31.800 --> 35:35.600
âª <i>She keeps on passing me by</i> âª

35:36.000 --> 35:38.400
Tap... the... bottle!

35:38.400 --> 35:40.200
- Drink it up, schoolgirl! Drink it!
- Go! Go! Go! Go!

35:40.200 --> 35:42.600
- Don't get it on my carpet!
- Drink it! Go! Oh! Oh! Oh!

35:42.600 --> 35:44.200
- All of it! All of it! Drink it!
- Go! Go! Don't stop!

35:44.200 --> 35:46.600
- Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!
- All the way! All the way!

35:46.600 --> 35:48.000
Yeah!

35:48.000 --> 35:49.900
Yeah, that's it! That's it.

35:52.000 --> 35:53.900
Hey, get my little homie
another pisto, Dawg.

35:53.900 --> 35:55.000
How you feel? You all right?

35:55.000 --> 35:56.300
- Yeah, I'm good.
- Yeah?

35:57.500 --> 35:58.400
<i>Â¿No aye pedo?</i> Right?

35:59.900 --> 36:01.500
- Whoo.
- Let me see that.

36:01.900 --> 36:04.500
âª <i>All I could do was stare</i> âª

36:04.500 --> 36:07.500
âª <i>back as kids, we used to kiss when
we played truth or dare</i> âª

36:07.500 --> 36:09.000
âª <i>Now she's more sophisticated
 highly edu-ma-cated</i> âª

36:09.000 --> 36:09.800
Drink

36:09.800 --> 36:13.100
âª <i>Not at all overrated,
I think I need a prayer</i> âª

36:13.900 --> 36:15.600
What's up with this fool Joaquin?

36:15.800 --> 36:17.300
He goes to my school.

36:17.300 --> 36:18.500
Yeah, Beyer?

36:19.000 --> 36:20.800
You know some <i>eses over there, right?</i>

36:23.200 --> 36:27.600
Hey, you, uh, ever play
shotgun with a blunt, Tony?

36:27.600 --> 36:29.300
- What's that?
- âª <i>like a doggie</i> âª

36:29.300 --> 36:32.300
âª <i>she was kind of like a star,

âª <i>damn, she looked good,

36:34.900 --> 36:37.600
âª <i>he was a rooty-toot, a nincompoop</i> âª

36:37.600 --> 36:39.100
âª <i>she told me soon your little...</i> âª

36:43.100 --> 36:46.000
âª <i>Brainiac, dumb-dumb,

âª <i>approach to the course,

36:48.700 --> 36:50.400
Who's this Joaquin bitch?

36:50.400 --> 36:51.700
Sure it's the same guy?

36:51.700 --> 36:52.900
You're a mess, man.

36:53.900 --> 36:55.400
Yeah, it's going down right now.

36:55.800 --> 36:57.400
Hey. He...

36:57.400 --> 36:59.000
Is he sure it's the same guy?

36:59.100 --> 37:01.600
âª <i>Check it out, baby,
check it out, dawg</i> âª

37:01.600 --> 37:02.900
Who's car is this?

37:02.900 --> 37:04.500
âª <i>Check it out, baby,
check it out, dawg</i> âª

37:04.600 --> 37:05.700
You sure it's him?

37:05.700 --> 37:07.700
- Hey, hold on.
- Who's car is this?

37:07.700 --> 37:08.800
He wants to talk to you.

37:10.300 --> 37:11.200
Yeah?

37:12.200 --> 37:14.000
Yeah... no, we're rolling up now.

37:14.600 --> 37:15.900
You sure?

37:16.800 --> 37:17.900
All right, cool.

37:18.200 --> 37:20.200
Yeah, yeah, I'll hook you
up next time for sure.

37:20.500 --> 37:22.000
All right, good looking out.

37:32.800 --> 37:34.300
What's going on?

37:39.400 --> 37:40.800
Take this.

37:46.300 --> 37:48.300
When I say go, you go.

37:49.700 --> 37:50.300
Huh?

37:50.300 --> 37:52.200
When I say go, you go. Understand?

37:55.800 --> 37:57.500
Hey, hey, hey.
Got next. We got next.

37:57.500 --> 37:58.600
All up!

38:06.000 --> 38:07.200
Handle this fool.

38:07.600 --> 38:09.900
This fool beat your sister! Go!

38:16.800 --> 38:17.800
Go!

38:29.500 --> 38:31.800
Great job. Let's go. Come on.

38:32.300 --> 38:34.400
Come on. Let's go. Walk. Walk.

38:35.000 --> 38:36.700
Don't look back. Keep moving.

39:01.900 --> 39:03.500
Oh, hey!

39:05.900 --> 39:06.600
Come on.

39:06.600 --> 39:08.500
Play it again. Play it,
play it. Look at that.

39:08.500 --> 39:10.400
He's so scared. Here it goes. Here it goes.

39:10.400 --> 39:11.300
Check it out. Check it out.

39:11.300 --> 39:12.900
Oh, it's when he cracked that fool, Dawg.

39:13.800 --> 39:15.200
He's not ready.

39:15.200 --> 39:16.900
Ohh!

39:16.900 --> 39:19.700
It was even better live, man.
He's like a combination.

39:19.700 --> 39:21.600
Yeah, that's what's up, dude.

39:21.900 --> 39:24.400
Man, Tony's crazy, man.

39:24.700 --> 39:26.300
You feel me? You crazy, kid.

39:26.300 --> 39:28.100
I love this kid, man.

39:28.600 --> 39:30.300
Thinks he's all bad now. Look at him.

39:30.300 --> 39:31.900
Come check out your work, man.

39:31.900 --> 39:34.500
âª Drop the game, it's not enough âª

39:34.600 --> 39:35.300
Play it again, man.

39:37.300 --> 39:41.800
âª I've been seeing all,
I've been seeing your soul âª

39:42.100 --> 39:45.300
âª give me things that I wanted to know âª

39:45.300 --> 39:47.400
âª tell me things that you've done âª

39:47.400 --> 39:49.500
âª oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh âª

39:49.500 --> 39:51.500
âª I've been feeling old âª

39:51.500 --> 39:54.200
âª I've been feeling cold âª

39:54.200 --> 39:57.200
âª you're the heat that I know âª

39:57.200 --> 39:59.100
âª listen, you are my sun âª

39:59.100 --> 40:01.300
He kept beating on me. He was lit, you know.

40:01.300 --> 40:03.500
He was crazy.

40:03.500 --> 40:05.800
And he had come to your
house to steal drugs?

40:05.800 --> 40:06.900
Yeah.

40:07.500 --> 40:09.000
And then what happened?

40:20.200 --> 40:22.400
Did he say anything while it was happening?

40:24.800 --> 40:26.600
"You white bitch."

40:30.300 --> 40:33.500
A little louder so the
recorder can pick it up.

40:34.900 --> 40:36.500
He kept calling me a white bitch.

40:36.500 --> 40:38.000
You white bitch!

40:38.000 --> 40:42.700
Kept saying, "white bitch,
white bitch, you white bitch."

40:43.400 --> 40:45.400
Evidence has now surfaced that shows,

40:45.400 --> 40:48.700
on multiple occasions, the
accused has committed assaults

40:48.700 --> 40:50.200
with the specific purpose

40:50.200 --> 40:52.600
of intimidating and terrorizing his victims

40:52.600 --> 40:55.600
based on their membership
to an ethnic group.

40:55.600 --> 40:57.400
We now believe, without question,

40:57.400 --> 40:59.900
Carter Nix targeted Matt and Gwen Skokie

40:59.900 --> 41:01.600
and entered their home with the intent

41:01.600 --> 41:04.200
to cause bodily harm because of their race.

41:04.700 --> 41:06.600
For this reason, the
District Attorney's office

41:06.600 --> 41:08.600
has decided it will vigorously pursue

41:08.600 --> 41:12.900
additional special-circumstances
charges against Carter Nix.

41:12.900 --> 41:14.900
As of today, this case is officially being

41:14.900 --> 41:17.200
categorized as a hate crime.

41:18.100 --> 41:20.900
We are continuing to investigate
all aspects of the case

41:22.200 --> 41:24.300
and believe we can win a conviction

41:24.300 --> 41:26.700
on all the charges Carter Nix is facing.

41:28.500 --> 41:30.000
A press release will be made available

41:30.000 --> 41:31.600
through the D.A.'s office.

41:32.400 --> 41:34.000
Thank you for attending.

42:04.400 --> 42:06.500
They should have made a
deal with me from the jump.

42:06.900 --> 42:09.100
Could have avoided all this nonsense.
