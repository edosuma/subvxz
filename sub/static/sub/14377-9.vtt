[Moaning]

01:23.050 --> 01:24.016
Eh...

01:24.050 --> 01:25.116
What's up, Dex?

01:25.150 --> 01:26.066
Dee Dee?

01:26.100 --> 01:27.283
That's right,
Dexter.

01:27.316 --> 01:29.050
And no matter
where you go,

01:29.083 --> 01:30.300
no matter
where you sleep,

01:30.333 --> 01:32.316
no matter
what you eat,
I will be there,

01:32.350 --> 01:34.383
like a stealth
ninja polar bear,

01:34.416 --> 01:37.083
waiting to pounce
on its next
unsuspecting victim,

01:37.116 --> 01:38.183
for I am...

01:38.216 --> 01:40.233
Dee Dee,
snowball warrior!

01:40.266 --> 01:42.283
[Laughing]

01:43.283 --> 01:47.150
Oh, another
winter of discontent.

01:54.400 --> 01:56.266
First base.

01:56.300 --> 01:58.433
You said it, brother.

02:02.100 --> 02:03.216
Second base.

02:06.016 --> 02:07.266
Third base.

02:09.433 --> 02:10.466
Home...

02:15.083 --> 02:16.200
I'm safe!

02:18.233 --> 02:20.316
You're out!

02:20.350 --> 02:22.116
[Ringing]

02:22.150 --> 02:24.183
Ah, what a fine--

02:24.216 --> 02:27.083
Dee Dee: Ha ha!
Got ya!

02:27.116 --> 02:30.366
Dad!

02:32.066 --> 02:33.083
Yes?

02:33.116 --> 02:34.333
I'd like to talk to you

02:34.366 --> 02:37.333
about the aggressive
behavioral patterns
of your daughter.

02:37.366 --> 02:39.333
I know I shouldn't
fight back,

02:39.366 --> 02:42.400
being that she is
my sister, a girl,
and the neighborhood champ,

02:42.433 --> 02:44.383
but could you
please tell Dee Dee

02:44.416 --> 02:47.183
to stop pummeling me
with snowballs?

02:48.216 --> 02:49.433
Did you say...

02:49.466 --> 02:51.100
Snowballs?

02:51.133 --> 02:52.416
Uh, yeah.

02:55.316 --> 02:58.433
They called me
champ,

02:58.466 --> 03:00.266
back
when I had...

03:00.300 --> 03:02.083
The gift.

03:03.400 --> 03:06.316
I was a natural
from day one.

03:08.116 --> 03:10.100
[Crying]

03:10.133 --> 03:13.200
As I grew, so
did my skills.

03:19.083 --> 03:20.100
Ow!

03:20.133 --> 03:23.283
In high school,
I was untouchable.

03:26.350 --> 03:28.433
Hey, grow up,
man!

03:41.183 --> 03:42.483
They were just
jealous,

03:43.016 --> 03:45.250
jealous
of my powers,

03:45.283 --> 03:47.483
for I was a king,

03:48.016 --> 03:49.483
a force of nature!

03:50.016 --> 03:54.083
I was the ultimate
snowball warrior!

03:55.083 --> 03:57.050
Then I
went to college.

03:57.083 --> 04:01.333
I was never
the same again!

04:01.366 --> 04:05.283
No!

04:08.066 --> 04:12.000
That was the coldest
winter...

04:12.033 --> 04:13.150
Ever.

04:13.183 --> 04:16.166
But that's where
you come in.

04:16.200 --> 04:19.400
You can help me
reclaim my title!

04:19.433 --> 04:23.200
Wh-wh-why not just
l-let Dee Dee do it?

04:23.233 --> 04:26.050
No! Her powers
are evil.

04:26.083 --> 04:28.050
Only as father
and son

04:28.083 --> 04:31.050
can we truly
carry on
the legacy.

04:31.083 --> 04:32.450
Let the training
begin!

04:36.216 --> 04:37.266
No.

04:38.433 --> 04:40.066
No!

04:43.016 --> 04:45.050
<i>No!</i>
Dexter, 5 words:

04:45.083 --> 04:47.083
Scoop, roll,
throw, hit, duck.

05:02.100 --> 05:04.283
Good job, son.

05:04.316 --> 05:06.300
You're ready.

05:08.250 --> 05:12.216
Boy, I hope I don't get hit
with a snowball

05:12.250 --> 05:15.483
while stupidly standing here
all alone in the yard.

05:16.016 --> 05:18.300
Sure is quiet, though...

05:20.383 --> 05:21.400
Without...

05:21.433 --> 05:23.316
Dee Dee!

05:26.350 --> 05:28.283
Um...uh...uh...

05:28.316 --> 05:29.283
Duck!

05:29.316 --> 05:31.100
Scoop! Roll!
Throw!

05:32.150 --> 05:33.416
Hit!

05:33.450 --> 05:38.200
No-o-o!

05:39.200 --> 05:41.083
Atta boy, Dexter!

05:42.133 --> 05:44.466
Hey, good job, Dexter.
You finally hit me.

05:45.000 --> 05:45.466
Thanks.

05:46.000 --> 05:47.233
What's this?

05:47.266 --> 05:50.450
Dexter, what do you
think you're doing?
Finish her!

05:50.483 --> 05:52.250
Oh, no.

05:52.283 --> 05:56.050
Dexter, you must reclaim
my throne by defeating
the enemy!

05:56.083 --> 05:57.083
The enemy?

05:57.116 --> 05:59.333
Your sister!

05:59.366 --> 06:01.266
Don't you see, Dexter?

06:01.300 --> 06:05.200
You inherit your snowball
fighting genes from me,

06:05.233 --> 06:09.116
whereas your sister
received hers from...

06:09.150 --> 06:10.116
From...

06:10.150 --> 06:12.266
The only one
ever to defeat me!

06:12.300 --> 06:13.383
Both: You mean...

06:13.416 --> 06:15.083
Yes!

06:15.116 --> 06:17.100
Dexter and Dee Dee:
Mom!

06:17.133 --> 06:19.416
Put the snowball
down, dear.

06:19.450 --> 06:21.333
I don't wanna.

06:21.366 --> 06:24.083
Wow, mom!
If you beat dad,

06:24.116 --> 06:27.166
you must be the bestest
snowball warrior ever!

06:27.200 --> 06:30.416
Oh, no! We were just
kids in college...

06:30.450 --> 06:34.250
One day I tossed
a snowball at him.

06:34.283 --> 06:35.250
Aah!

06:35.283 --> 06:37.250
He took it
really hard.

06:37.283 --> 06:39.300
Oh, the pain.

06:39.333 --> 06:41.233
Relax, dear.

06:41.266 --> 06:44.400
Gosh, dad.
You went crazy
for all these years

06:44.433 --> 06:47.283
just because mom
threw a snowball
at you?

06:47.316 --> 06:50.016
Sounds
kind of silly,
doesn't it?

06:51.316 --> 06:54.366
It does?
It<i>do</i>

06:54.400 --> 06:56.316
I'm sorry, honey.

06:56.350 --> 06:58.350
[Laughing]

07:02.100 --> 07:04.100
[Laughing]

07:06.133 --> 07:08.100
Yeah, that's
just as silly

07:08.133 --> 07:11.316
as Dexter having
a secret laboratory
in his bedroom!

07:11.350 --> 07:12.483
What?
What?

07:13.016 --> 07:14.266
Nothing, nothing.

07:32.116 --> 07:34.266
Look, up in the sky!
It's an eagle!

07:34.300 --> 07:35.350
It's a rocket!

07:35.383 --> 07:38.466
No. It's my new
major glory
action figure

07:39.000 --> 07:40.166
with parachute
action!

07:40.200 --> 07:41.383
Cool!

07:41.416 --> 07:43.383
Check out
my major glory.

07:43.416 --> 07:46.150
It's got a super-command
voice module!

07:46.183 --> 07:47.466
Brush your teeth.

07:48.016 --> 07:49.266
Clean your plate.

07:49.300 --> 07:51.100
Look at my muscles.

07:51.133 --> 07:52.383
Yo, check mine out.

07:52.416 --> 07:55.300
It has a special
fighting fists
of fury feature.

07:56.300 --> 07:57.350
All: Awesome!

07:57.383 --> 08:00.466
Three cheers
for the major glory gang!

08:01.000 --> 08:03.183
Hip, hip, hooray!

08:03.216 --> 08:05.183
Hip, hip, hooray!

08:05.216 --> 08:06.183
Hip, hip--

08:06.216 --> 08:08.183
Dexter: Hooray!

08:08.216 --> 08:11.033
My 3 best pals
in the whole world!

08:11.066 --> 08:12.366
Oh, great.

08:12.400 --> 08:14.050
It's dorkster.

08:14.083 --> 08:15.216
What do you want?

08:15.250 --> 08:17.466
What do I want?
Why, to pal around

08:18.000 --> 08:21.183
with my 3 best chums
in the major glory
gang.

08:21.216 --> 08:23.383
You got to have
a major glory
action figure

08:23.416 --> 08:25.266
to be in the gang.

08:25.300 --> 08:28.450
Oh, but I do.
Feast your
optic orbs

08:28.483 --> 08:30.283
on this!

08:30.316 --> 08:32.316
[Laughing]

08:33.433 --> 08:36.116
You call that
an action figure?

08:36.150 --> 08:38.450
That's just a lousy
cardboard cutout.

08:38.483 --> 08:42.216
Yes, I cut it out
myself from
my cereal box

08:42.250 --> 08:45.116
while eating
my morning bowl
of glory-os.

08:45.150 --> 08:48.150
Look! It even
has super-
saluting action.

08:49.233 --> 08:52.400
You insult the glory
of the glory gang!

08:52.433 --> 08:57.083
You want to be
one of us, get yourself
a real action figure!

09:00.433 --> 09:01.450
Mother?

09:01.483 --> 09:02.450
Yes, Dexter?

09:02.483 --> 09:04.416
I would like
to formally request

09:04.450 --> 09:08.033
that you purchase
a new major glory
action figure for me.

09:08.066 --> 09:10.000
Of course, dear.

09:10.033 --> 09:11.283
For your birthday.

09:11.316 --> 09:13.283
But that's
too far away!

09:13.316 --> 09:16.300
Well, sweetheart,
if you can't wait
for your birthday,

09:16.333 --> 09:19.016
you'll just
have to share
with your friends.

09:20.400 --> 09:23.400
I'll bet you can't
even fly.

09:26.050 --> 09:29.350
Ooh! Major glory,
you don't look so good.

09:29.383 --> 09:31.383
You look
a little thin.

09:33.033 --> 09:34.283
Hi, Dexter!

09:34.316 --> 09:37.333
Gee, Dexter,
why the long
face?

09:37.366 --> 09:41.083
I have no
friends, and I am
totally unpopular.

09:41.116 --> 09:42.116
Duh!

09:42.150 --> 09:44.266
I need a new
major glory action figure,

09:44.300 --> 09:46.416
or my pals won't
talk to me.

09:46.450 --> 09:48.466
Dexter, i'm
surprised at you.

09:49.000 --> 09:50.066
Why?

09:50.100 --> 09:52.250
Because you're
too dumb to make
your own doll.

09:52.283 --> 09:53.450
I made one.

09:53.483 --> 09:55.316
Her name is
pretty Polly.

09:55.350 --> 09:56.316
[Kiss]

09:56.350 --> 09:58.316
Pretty Polly!
Pretty Polly!

09:58.350 --> 10:00.400
Make my own doll?

10:00.433 --> 10:02.416
I am just
a little boy!

10:02.450 --> 10:05.250
Doll-making requires
specialized tools and equipment,

10:05.283 --> 10:07.000
high-tech machinery.

10:07.033 --> 10:09.466
In order for me to make
a doll, I would need...

10:10.000 --> 10:13.150
A laboratory!

10:13.183 --> 10:15.183
[Laughing maniacally]

10:33.216 --> 10:34.200
Yes!

10:34.233 --> 10:35.316
Yes!

10:35.350 --> 10:37.316
Yes!

10:37.350 --> 10:40.033
Look at my creation!

10:40.066 --> 10:43.300
It--it is beautiful.

10:43.333 --> 10:45.333
[Yelling]

10:49.250 --> 10:51.100
All: Whoa!

10:55.316 --> 10:57.450
Greetings,
chums of mine!

10:57.483 --> 11:00.033
How do you
like my new
action figure?

11:00.066 --> 11:03.200
Uh...it's...uh...

11:03.233 --> 11:05.366
It has several
very astounding
features

11:05.400 --> 11:07.200
which you may find
interesting.

11:07.233 --> 11:08.250
Observe.

11:08.283 --> 11:10.466
It has super
space flight action.

11:11.000 --> 11:13.450
Look! A piece
of moon rock!

11:13.483 --> 11:15.366
All: Whoa!

11:15.400 --> 11:19.233
It also comes equipped
with super star-spangled
laser vision.

11:22.450 --> 11:25.083
All: Whoa!

11:25.116 --> 11:27.266
And he has
super kung fu grip.

11:27.300 --> 11:29.016
Action figure:
Hi-Yah!

11:29.050 --> 11:31.116
Cool figure, Dexter!

11:31.150 --> 11:33.266
Thanks.
I made it myself.

11:33.300 --> 11:35.016
Just one problem.

11:35.050 --> 11:37.400
You wouldn't mind
making one
of those figures

11:37.433 --> 11:40.033
for all of us,
would you?

11:40.066 --> 11:41.250
Uh, well...

11:41.283 --> 11:45.483
I mean, after all,
we all got to be
equal members, right?

11:46.016 --> 11:47.233
I guess so.

11:47.266 --> 11:49.400
Good! See you
back here tomorrow...

11:49.433 --> 11:52.116
If you're
our true pal.

11:52.150 --> 11:55.450
Oh, I am. I am.
Don't worry!

12:01.466 --> 12:05.083
Let's go make
some friends!

12:05.116 --> 12:07.216
Dexter: Here are
your remotes!

12:07.250 --> 12:08.416
Give them a try.

12:08.450 --> 12:11.216
Yours has
super arctic wind breath.

12:14.433 --> 12:16.116
Kid: Cool!

12:16.150 --> 12:19.266
Yours has
super impenetrable
snap-on freedom armor.

12:20.300 --> 12:21.416
Second kid: Radical!

12:21.450 --> 12:24.366
And yours has
an all-American
cloaking device.

12:24.400 --> 12:26.250
Third kid: Outta sight!

12:26.283 --> 12:29.250
Is that glory gang
material, or what?

12:29.283 --> 12:31.000
Kids: Mine's
the coolest!

12:31.033 --> 12:33.000
[Kids fighting]

12:33.033 --> 12:35.000
We can't decide
whose is better.

12:35.033 --> 12:37.133
You got
to give us all
the same stuff.

12:37.166 --> 12:39.033
If you're our pal,
that is.

12:39.066 --> 12:40.283
Uh, of course.

12:40.316 --> 12:41.483
Of course I am.

12:44.116 --> 12:47.183
Dexter: Computer,
verify action figure status.

12:47.216 --> 12:51.383
Computer: All figures
possess equal amounts
of all super-features.

12:51.416 --> 12:53.383
A possibility
of overload exists.

12:53.416 --> 12:58.083
Repeat, a possibility
of overload exists.

12:58.116 --> 13:00.250
Here they are.
They do everything.

13:00.283 --> 13:03.250
Now can I be
in the club?

13:03.283 --> 13:05.250
Kids: Yeah, man.
You sure can.

13:05.283 --> 13:06.333
Watch mine!

13:06.366 --> 13:07.383
No, watch mine!

13:07.416 --> 13:09.066
Wait, watch mine!

13:15.450 --> 13:17.066
Kids: Cool!

13:17.100 --> 13:19.466
Computer: Overload.
Overload. Overload.

13:22.450 --> 13:25.166
Hey, these things
are defective.

13:25.200 --> 13:27.416
You call
yourself
a club member?

13:27.450 --> 13:29.100
Let's lynch him.

13:29.133 --> 13:30.200
Major glory:
Stand fast, citizens!

13:30.233 --> 13:32.366
Dexter: Hey, it's the real
major glory.

13:32.400 --> 13:34.016
I am saved!

13:35.100 --> 13:37.200
Which one of you
is Dexter?

13:37.233 --> 13:38.450
That would be me.

13:38.483 --> 13:41.350
And may I say
I am your biggest fan.

13:41.383 --> 13:43.066
Well, you have
good taste, son.

13:43.100 --> 13:44.400
Now, let's go.

13:44.433 --> 13:47.350
Well, Dexter, what
have you learned
from all this?

13:47.383 --> 13:49.450
I have learned
that it was wrong

13:49.483 --> 13:51.433
to try and buy
my pals' friendship

13:51.466 --> 13:53.200
with impressive
action figures.

13:53.233 --> 13:55.216
Whoa, we're talking
about something

13:55.250 --> 13:57.216
far more important
than friendship.

13:57.250 --> 13:59.450
We're talking
about copyright
infringement.

13:59.483 --> 14:01.450
Now, Dexter,
prepare to meet

14:01.483 --> 14:04.266
someone far more
powerful than I!

14:04.300 --> 14:06.200
Who's that?

14:06.233 --> 14:07.450
My attorney.

14:14.050 --> 14:15.266
Whatcha doing?

14:15.300 --> 14:17.266
Reading up
on animal biology.

14:17.300 --> 14:20.150
I bet I know
more about animals
than you.

14:20.183 --> 14:21.400
Oh, you think?

14:21.433 --> 14:22.450
Yup.

14:22.483 --> 14:24.316
Ok, why are storks'
legs so long?

14:24.350 --> 14:26.183
So their feet
can reach the ground.

14:26.216 --> 14:28.300
Why do kangaroos
only live in Australia?

14:28.333 --> 14:31.250
So they can be
near their families.

14:33.333 --> 14:35.433
Did you know
deers don't have uncles?

14:35.466 --> 14:37.350
They just have
antlers!

14:37.383 --> 14:40.316
Cha cha cha!

15:00.350 --> 15:03.083
[Reading to himself]

15:03.116 --> 15:04.333
[Thinking]
What a fantastic challenge.

15:04.366 --> 15:06.183
I bet I could win
a race like that.

15:06.216 --> 15:08.116
I bet I could build a car
that was faster
than all the other cars,

15:08.150 --> 15:09.416
and then I'd win.

15:09.450 --> 15:11.200
But what about dad?
He's never let me
enter such a race,

15:11.233 --> 15:13.066
and he'd fear
for my safety.

15:13.100 --> 15:16.050
And I don't blame him,
but I have to enter that race
no matter what!

15:16.083 --> 15:18.000
Dad, I'm going to enter
the soapbox derby.

15:18.033 --> 15:19.233
No! No son of mine
is going to race,

15:19.266 --> 15:21.200
and for me to explain
my reasons why would be
a long story,

15:21.233 --> 15:23.100
but I'll tell you anyway.

15:23.133 --> 15:25.383
It was 2 years ago,
during that very same race
down volcano mountain.

15:25.416 --> 15:28.033
Your older sister Dee Dee
was one of the drivers
in that race.

15:28.066 --> 15:31.050
But what she didn't know
was that the race was filled
with dangers and tricks
at every turn.

15:31.083 --> 15:33.383
Any experienced driver
knows how to keep an eye out
for these tricks,

15:33.416 --> 15:35.433
because if you don't
pay attention, they can
trick you and mess you up.

15:35.466 --> 15:38.016
But your sister was
overconfident about
her driving abilities,

15:38.050 --> 15:40.300
which sent her down
a one-way road to disaster.

15:46.333 --> 15:48.183
She was never
to be heard from again.

15:48.216 --> 15:53.216
Dad, I'm right here!
Hello! Earth to dad.

15:53.250 --> 15:54.266
Dexter, did you
hear that?

15:54.300 --> 15:56.133
Yup, sure did, dad.

15:56.166 --> 15:58.466
It's ok for me to race
as long as I don't hit
any turtles. Gotcha.

15:59.000 --> 16:01.116
No, it's not ok.
I don't want you to race
or even think about racing.

16:01.150 --> 16:02.316
I'd erase any thoughts
of racing

16:02.350 --> 16:04.466
you have racing
about your head
right now! Hmm.

16:05.000 --> 16:06.066
But, dad!

16:06.100 --> 16:08.233
Oh, ok, you can race,
but only on one condition.

16:08.266 --> 16:10.316
You do it for the memory
of your long-lost
sister Dee Dee, ok?

16:10.350 --> 16:11.316
Ok.

16:11.350 --> 16:14.316
Hello! I'm right here!

16:14.350 --> 16:16.366
There it was again.
Hmm...

16:16.400 --> 16:19.200
The first thing any
successful racer needs
is a car.

16:19.233 --> 16:21.250
All the top racers
drive cars, and that's
what makes them go.

16:21.283 --> 16:22.466
But cars don't grow
on trees,

16:23.000 --> 16:25.166
except for this one,
because it's made
of wood.

16:25.200 --> 16:27.350
Behold the Mark-5.

16:27.383 --> 16:29.150
Ah!

16:29.183 --> 16:30.483
The Mark-5
is a marvel
of engineering.

16:31.016 --> 16:33.033
It's equipped
with the most modern
driving equipment:

16:33.066 --> 16:34.116
Wheels.

16:34.150 --> 16:36.316
Gosh, dad.
You sure have
outdone yourself,

16:36.350 --> 16:38.316
but do you think
we could slap on

16:38.350 --> 16:42.250
some all-wheel-drive
traction, supercharged-
piston cam, high-octane-
output torquefiers?

16:42.283 --> 16:45.016
What? What's this?
I can't believe
what I'm hearing.

16:45.050 --> 16:47.266
Outfit the Mark-5
with useless gadgets?
Whatever for?

16:47.300 --> 16:50.016
So the car would be safe
and I don't crash up.

16:50.050 --> 16:51.450
Huh! You're a very
bright boy, Dexter.

16:51.483 --> 16:54.266
Only you would know
that crashing is the part
I hate most about racing.

16:54.300 --> 16:55.416
To me, crashing is bad.

16:55.450 --> 16:57.483
So, ok. You can have
your gadgets.

16:58.016 --> 17:00.350
Narrator:
And so Dexter and dad
worked late into the night,

17:00.383 --> 17:02.083
souping up the Mark-5.

17:08.383 --> 17:10.050
[Thinking]
Dad is tired.

17:10.083 --> 17:12.300
He has been working very hard
helping me modify the Mark-5,

17:12.333 --> 17:14.100
but now it is time
for him to rest.

17:14.133 --> 17:16.116
Come on, dad.
It's time for bed.

17:16.150 --> 17:17.150
[Grumbling]

17:19.300 --> 17:21.100
Narrator: Secretly unknown
to Dexter,

17:21.133 --> 17:23.100
a mysterious stranger
is mysteriously watching.

17:23.133 --> 17:24.466
Mandark: Excellent!
Ha ha! Excellent!

17:25.000 --> 17:28.050
Now I, mandark,
know how Dexter plans
to win the soapbox derby.

17:28.083 --> 17:30.350
He plans to use
this magnificent car.
But how does it work?

17:30.383 --> 17:32.383
Oh, maybe these
top-secret plans will help.

17:32.416 --> 17:35.100
They do! These top-secret plans
tell me the secrets

17:35.133 --> 17:37.183
on how the Mark-5 works.
Excellent! Ha ha!

17:37.216 --> 17:38.433
Excellent! Ha! Ha ha!

17:38.466 --> 17:39.366
Hello!

17:39.400 --> 17:41.050
What?
Who are you?

17:41.083 --> 17:43.366
I'm Dee Dee,
Dexter's older sister
who, two years ago,

17:43.400 --> 17:45.233
crashed up in the
volcano mountain race

17:45.266 --> 17:46.366
and was never
heard from again.

17:46.400 --> 17:48.066
Except I was heard
from again,

17:48.100 --> 17:49.350
it's just that my dad
likes to exaggerate,

17:49.383 --> 17:51.250
and he got mad
because I broke his car,

17:51.283 --> 17:52.416
and he wouldn't
let me race again.

17:52.450 --> 17:55.133
Except I had to race again--
it was in my blood--

17:55.166 --> 17:58.266
so sometimes I stow away
in my brother's trunk
so I can be close to the
action,

17:58.300 --> 18:01.266
and sometimes I secretly
race under the disguise
of "racer d,"

18:01.300 --> 18:03.266
but I shouldn't have
told you that.

18:03.300 --> 18:04.483
I've got a monkey!

18:05.016 --> 18:06.350
So? I don't care
about monkeys.

18:06.383 --> 18:09.266
Hey, don't you
be mean, mister...
Mister...

18:09.300 --> 18:12.483
Say, who are you?
I don't even know
who you are!

18:13.016 --> 18:14.466
My name is mandark,
and I am Dexter's rival.

18:15.000 --> 18:16.483
He and I have been
competing in science and
other things for years,

18:17.016 --> 18:18.266
and this race
is just one more
of those competitions

18:18.300 --> 18:19.400
where we try
to beat each other.

18:19.433 --> 18:21.350
Except I try and win
by being sneaky and bad.

18:21.383 --> 18:23.416
My plan this time
is to sabotage
the Mark-5

18:23.450 --> 18:25.183
so it doesn't work
as good as it should.

18:25.216 --> 18:27.083
Then, when Dexter
is racing, he's likely
to crash up,

18:27.116 --> 18:28.166
leaving the room
for me to win.

18:28.200 --> 18:29.400
Well, that's not
very nice.

18:29.433 --> 18:31.333
No, but giving candy
to little girls
and monkeys

18:31.366 --> 18:32.433
so they can
keep a secret<i>is.</i>

18:32.466 --> 18:34.283
Ah!

18:34.316 --> 18:37.450
Now, if you'll excuse me
while I sabotage
your brother's car...

18:37.483 --> 18:40.083
Yum yum yum!
What car?
Yum yum yum!

18:40.116 --> 18:41.283
Excellent. Ha ha!

18:41.316 --> 18:43.033
Excellent. Ha! Ha ha!

18:43.066 --> 18:44.083
[Laughing maniacally]

18:44.116 --> 18:46.083
Announcer: Good morning,
race fans,

18:46.116 --> 18:49.266
and welcome to
the annual soapbox derby
down volcano mountain,

18:49.300 --> 18:51.416
where some of the most
skilled and talented
kid racers of the day

18:51.450 --> 18:54.450
are taking part in this
high-speed challenge
against mother nature.

18:55.000 --> 18:58.050
It appears that the drivers
are setting their ties
for the start of the race.

18:58.083 --> 18:59.066
Mandark:
Hey, Dexter.

18:59.100 --> 19:00.100
I just wanted to say
I'm sorry

19:00.133 --> 19:01.466
for beating you
in today's race.

19:02.000 --> 19:04.083
Boy, your dad must be
ashamed of having
2 losers in the family.

19:04.116 --> 19:06.050
You take that back,
mandark, or I will...

19:06.083 --> 19:07.083
[Rumbling]

19:07.116 --> 19:08.200
Oh!

19:08.233 --> 19:09.483
Announcer: Drivers,
get to your cars!

19:12.250 --> 19:14.283
Kids: Vroom, vroom.

19:14.316 --> 19:16.316
[Snarling]

19:17.316 --> 19:19.000
I can't watch!

19:30.016 --> 19:32.016
Hey, Dexter,
I hear your car
is not only fast

19:32.050 --> 19:33.466
but it also
is very safe.
Is that true?

19:34.000 --> 19:38.050
Mm-hmm. It is. My dad
and I fixed it up,
and we did a good job.

19:38.083 --> 19:41.266
Oh, yeah? Well, how
good of a job can
it do against this?

19:41.300 --> 19:42.283
Ah!

19:42.316 --> 19:44.033
Like sister,
like brother.

19:44.066 --> 19:45.366
Ha ha ha!
Ha ha ha!

19:49.466 --> 19:51.316
Ah!

19:51.350 --> 19:53.150
My turbo-jump
is not working.

19:53.183 --> 19:54.450
The Mark-5
has been sabotaged.

19:54.483 --> 19:56.083
I'm going to
crash up!

19:59.316 --> 20:01.266
[Sighs]

20:01.300 --> 20:02.283
Racer d!

20:02.316 --> 20:04.116
Hi, Dexter!

20:04.150 --> 20:05.266
Narrator: Secretly unknown
to Dexter,

20:05.300 --> 20:07.116
racer d is actually
his older sister Dee Dee,

20:07.150 --> 20:09.000
who supposedly
disappeared 2 years ago,
but she actually didn't.

20:09.033 --> 20:10.300
Bye, Dexter!

20:10.333 --> 20:12.316
[Thinking]
Racer d saved my life,
and that's good for me,

20:12.350 --> 20:14.466
but I can't help wondering
who she is.

20:15.000 --> 20:16.400
[Thinking]
Excellent, excellent.
I'm in first place.

20:16.433 --> 20:18.133
My sneaky ways
put me in the lead.

20:18.166 --> 20:19.350
I'd give myself
a pat on the back,

20:19.383 --> 20:21.250
but I'm driving,
so I'll do it later.

20:21.283 --> 20:24.016
What? Who is that mysterious
driver coming up behind me?
So, who could it be?

20:24.050 --> 20:25.233
It's racer d,

20:25.266 --> 20:28.400
the most beautiful racer
in the world.

20:28.433 --> 20:30.150
[Dreamily]
Racer d...

20:30.183 --> 20:31.316
[Tires squealing]

20:31.350 --> 20:32.400
[Crash]

20:32.433 --> 20:34.150
Oh, hello there,
turtle.

20:34.183 --> 20:35.416
Funny running into you.

20:35.450 --> 20:37.416
Oh, there goes Dexter
to win the race.

20:37.450 --> 20:41.100
Bye, Dexter. Congratulations.
Say hi to racer d for me.

20:41.133 --> 20:42.450
Racer d...

20:42.483 --> 20:45.116
Announcer:
Here comes the first racer
to cross the finish line.

20:45.150 --> 20:47.050
It's Dexter
in the Mark-5...

20:47.083 --> 20:48.150
Crowd: Yay!

20:48.183 --> 20:49.450
Followed by a trail
of hot, molten lava.

20:49.483 --> 20:51.200
Crowd: Yay!

20:51.233 --> 20:53.033
Is it over yet?
Did Dexter crash up?

20:54.333 --> 20:57.233
No, no he didn't!
He did just the opposite!
He won!

20:57.266 --> 20:59.150
And winning is the part
I enjoy most about racing,

20:59.183 --> 21:01.133
and I enjoy it even more
when the winner is my son!

21:01.166 --> 21:04.016
Congratulations, Dexter.
You made me very proud.

21:04.050 --> 21:05.350
Thanks, dad.

21:05.383 --> 21:10.233
If only your...
Older sister Dee Dee
was here to...See this.

21:10.266 --> 21:11.450
I'm right here,
dad!

21:11.483 --> 21:15.100
Oh, Dee Dee.
Dee Dee, where have
you been all these years?

21:15.133 --> 21:16.266
Right behind you.

21:16.300 --> 21:18.183
Oh, you know
I never look
back there. Ha ha!

21:18.216 --> 21:21.183
Huh? No, monkey, no!
That is not candy.

21:21.216 --> 21:22.383
It is hot lava!
