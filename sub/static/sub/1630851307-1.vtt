WEBVTT

00:12.762 --> 00:13.513
No, let's just sit on the dock.

00:15.390 --> 00:17.267
Oh, my...

00:17.308 --> 00:20.562
No, this is not okay.

00:23.356 --> 00:25.734
You guys can go
through a lot emotionally,

00:25.775 --> 00:31.197
and then you bring it back to
the complete reset of game on.

00:35.243 --> 00:37.495
Tonight we have rigatoni
bolognese.

00:37.537 --> 00:39.748
You got rigatoni bolognese.

00:39.789 --> 00:42.459
Guess what,
I'm your chief stew now.

00:42.500 --> 00:43.793
You can't be too bougie.

00:43.835 --> 00:45.337
This is how you'll do it.

00:45.378 --> 00:46.629
Oh, my God.

00:48.590 --> 00:49.758
Yeah!

00:51.593 --> 00:52.594
Uh, yeah.

00:52.635 --> 00:54.387
Oh, hi.

00:56.765 --> 00:58.725
Are you ready for
this wedding day?

00:58.767 --> 00:59.726
Oh, my God.

00:59.768 --> 01:02.562
Woo, we got married, bitches!

01:02.604 --> 01:06.399
So thankful.
Look at this rainbow!

01:06.441 --> 01:08.109
Yes!

01:17.160 --> 01:18.870
You kissed Mzi.

01:18.912 --> 01:20.830
We kissed last night.

01:20.872 --> 01:22.415
What, no,
we kissed last night.

01:25.377 --> 01:27.379
Boat romances...
they're dangerous.

01:30.382 --> 01:31.758
This is what happens
when I'm single.

01:31.800 --> 01:33.426
Woo!

01:33.468 --> 01:36.513
The lazy Susan
is being ridden hard.

01:40.308 --> 01:41.559
Come on.

01:41.601 --> 01:42.727
Whoa [bleep]!

01:42.769 --> 01:44.145
Oh, my God.

01:45.730 --> 01:47.148
Keep the line outta
the water, please.

01:47.190 --> 01:48.441
[bleep]

01:48.483 --> 01:50.402
To lead people
is to invest in them.

01:50.443 --> 01:51.569
-Amazing.
-Good job.

01:51.611 --> 01:52.779
-Thanks so much.
-You're welcome.

01:52.821 --> 01:54.322
It's up to you.

01:59.744 --> 02:01.246
Right now, I'm pissed off
with you.

02:01.287 --> 02:03.623
I don't care.
I'm, like, leaving

02:03.665 --> 02:05.583
Hey, Mom,
I'm quitting this boat.

02:05.625 --> 02:07.627
That's an incident
report, Malia.

02:07.669 --> 02:09.796
-I'm not a chief officer.
-I don't give a [bleep]!

02:09.838 --> 02:12.340
You should have come
to me that he was hurt.

02:12.382 --> 02:14.175
-[bleep]
-Ugh.

02:14.217 --> 02:15.969
His blood pressure's really
high, he has chest pains.

02:16.011 --> 02:17.470
He needs to go to the hospital.

02:17.512 --> 02:19.305
Red on deck, red on deck.

02:19.347 --> 02:21.599
This is gonna pass, I promise.

02:21.641 --> 02:23.309
Ah!

02:23.351 --> 02:26.563
If we're not challenged,
then we won't grow.

02:26.604 --> 02:27.939
Whoa, what's going on there?

02:27.981 --> 02:29.858
If you [bleep] up, it's on me!

02:29.899 --> 02:30.942
Everybody's being so
----ing dramatic!

02:30.984 --> 02:36.489
Stop the ----ing noise!

02:36.531 --> 02:38.700
Stop being a kiss-ass,
[bleep] off!

02:38.742 --> 02:40.243
Hey, whoa, enough!

02:40.285 --> 02:41.870
This is your chance
to redeem yourself.

02:41.911 --> 02:43.663
If you don't do it,

02:43.705 --> 02:45.373
then you're off the boat
at the end of this charter.

03:09.439 --> 03:11.524
Hello?

03:11.566 --> 03:13.443
-Hi!
-Hi!

03:13.485 --> 03:14.444
How are you?

03:14.486 --> 03:15.779
I'm good.

03:15.820 --> 03:16.780
-Welcome okay.
-I'm a hugger.

03:16.821 --> 03:17.781
Okay.

03:17.822 --> 03:19.282
I'm Katie.

03:19.324 --> 03:20.867
-Nice to meet you.
-Nice to meet you, too.

03:20.909 --> 03:22.660
Wow, I'm looking
forward to this.

03:22.702 --> 03:25.455
I mean, this is impressive.
You have some experience.

03:25.497 --> 03:26.873
Yeah.

03:26.915 --> 03:29.542
I don't consider myself
a typical chief stew.

03:29.584 --> 03:34.381
My last boat was a 73-meter, and
had about seven girls under me.

03:34.422 --> 03:36.299
When you're in a higher role,

03:36.341 --> 03:38.468
I think it's important to show
that you still work as hard.

03:38.510 --> 03:39.761
It's a Capricorn thing.

03:39.803 --> 03:41.429
I think you get more out of
your crew

03:41.471 --> 03:43.556
if you're trying to keep
a good vibe on board,

03:43.598 --> 03:44.891
as opposed to
if you're just a psycho bitch

03:44.933 --> 03:46.393
telling them what to do.

03:46.434 --> 03:47.560
They're gonna be
like [bleep] you.

03:47.602 --> 03:48.728
-Cool.
-Go check out your bunk.

03:48.770 --> 03:49.854
I'll go down to the crew mess...

03:49.896 --> 03:50.855
-Yeah.
-...and check that out.

03:50.897 --> 03:51.856
Yeah, all right, welcome aboard.

03:51.898 --> 03:53.692
Cool, thank you, Sandy.

03:53.733 --> 03:55.819
Last season was the hardest
season I ever did in my life.

03:55.860 --> 03:59.823
Everybody does this, they look
back and they have regrets

03:59.864 --> 04:02.033
on how they acted
or what they did.

04:02.075 --> 04:04.327
I was ready to go,
this is it,

04:04.369 --> 04:05.912
I don't want to
do this anymore.

04:05.954 --> 04:08.665
This is the stuff that
defines our character.

04:08.707 --> 04:11.376
Can we find it when
we're ready to give up?

04:11.418 --> 04:14.504
I come back because
I love to mentor people.

04:14.546 --> 04:16.589
and I wanna lead a team.

04:16.631 --> 04:17.757
That's why I'm here.

04:19.551 --> 04:20.844
Hello?

04:22.887 --> 04:25.432
-Sorry, I'm getting changed!
-Oh, no worries.

04:25.473 --> 04:27.434
-I'm Katie.
-Katie, Malia.

04:27.475 --> 04:28.810
-Nice to meet you.
-Nice to meet you.

04:28.852 --> 04:29.978
-Hi.
-Hi.

04:30.020 --> 04:31.771
-I'm Mathew.
-Hi, Mathew.

04:31.813 --> 04:33.398
-Nice to meet you.
-Welcome.

04:33.440 --> 04:34.399
Thank you very much.

04:34.441 --> 04:36.067
Are you the new chief stew?

04:36.109 --> 04:37.444
-Yes.
-Awesome, cool.

04:37.485 --> 04:38.445
-Yeah.
-Are you excited?

04:38.486 --> 04:40.321
A little nervous.

04:40.363 --> 04:41.489
I mean, we're here now, right?

04:41.531 --> 04:43.324
-Yeah.
-No turning back.

04:43.366 --> 04:44.451
-Let me show you your galley.
-Awesome, thank you so much.

04:44.492 --> 04:46.369
Welcome aboard.
Impressive.

04:46.411 --> 04:48.079
Like, you've worked
for some impressive people.

04:48.121 --> 04:51.124
Yeah. I've been a professional
chef for the last 14 years.

04:51.166 --> 04:53.376
I've been a private chef
for the Dolan family,

04:53.418 --> 04:55.086
who own Madison Square Garden,

04:55.128 --> 04:58.089
Rupert Murdoch, Hugh Jackman,
Robert Kraft.

04:58.131 --> 05:00.592
I'm always nervous when
I go into a new job.

05:00.633 --> 05:03.553
I wanna make everyone happy.
Just hope people like me.

05:03.595 --> 05:05.013
Looking forward
to the best season ever.

05:05.055 --> 05:06.139
Yeah, me too.

05:06.181 --> 05:07.557
-Oh, nice.
-Yeah.

05:07.599 --> 05:08.767
Not too bad.

05:08.808 --> 05:09.768
Good amount of work to do today.

05:09.809 --> 05:11.478
Yeah. Welcome aboard.

05:11.519 --> 05:13.021
Thank you so much.
I'm excited to work for you.

05:13.063 --> 05:14.356
-It's a pleasure to have you.
-Yeah, thanks.

05:14.397 --> 05:15.440
Awesome, I'll leave you to it.

05:21.154 --> 05:22.530
Hi!

05:22.572 --> 05:24.699
-How are you?
-Good, how are you?

05:24.741 --> 05:26.493
Good, what'd you do
over the past year?

05:26.534 --> 05:27.494
-Yeah.
-Yeah?

05:27.535 --> 05:28.912
I've been nonstop.

05:28.953 --> 05:30.830
Just got off a charter
season in the Med, so.

05:30.872 --> 05:32.040
Yeah? What size boat?

05:32.082 --> 05:34.834
A 55, second officer.

05:34.876 --> 05:36.086
Bosun, second officer,
so yeah.

05:36.127 --> 05:37.879
-Cool.
-Very good.

05:37.921 --> 05:40.507
It's actually a crazy feeling
being back in Croatia,

05:40.548 --> 05:43.510
because the last time I was
here, I was a green deckie.

05:43.551 --> 05:44.678
Practice.

05:44.719 --> 05:46.638
Go forward, go reverse.

05:46.680 --> 05:48.807
It was the opportunities
that Captain Sandy gave me

05:48.848 --> 05:51.393
my first season that made
me wanna stick with yachting.

05:51.434 --> 05:53.812
-Here's your deck crew.
-Okay.

05:53.853 --> 05:55.397
Deck, deck, engineer,
that's cool.

05:55.438 --> 05:57.190
Cool, thank you,
I'll look over these, yeah.

05:57.232 --> 05:58.525
Yeah, welcome back, Malia.

05:58.566 --> 05:59.693
-Thanks, appreciate it.
-Okay.

05:59.734 --> 06:01.027
-Hi!
-I'm Mathew.

06:01.069 --> 06:02.737
-I'm Katie.
-Nice to meet you, Katie.

06:02.779 --> 06:03.738
Yes.

06:03.780 --> 06:04.906
Awesome.

06:08.201 --> 06:09.744
Oh, hey.

06:09.786 --> 06:10.912
-David.
-David?

06:10.954 --> 06:11.913
-Malia.
-Nice to meet you.

06:11.955 --> 06:12.914
Nice to meet you.

06:12.956 --> 06:13.915
Sweet.

06:13.957 --> 06:15.542
What do I start with here?

06:15.583 --> 06:16.751
All right.

06:20.088 --> 06:21.089
Let's start this bad boy.

06:21.131 --> 06:22.549
-Yeah.
-I'm Lexi.

06:22.590 --> 06:23.883
-I'm Katie.
-Nice to meet you.

06:23.925 --> 06:24.968
Nice to meet you, too.

06:25.010 --> 06:26.136
I guess I'll be your stewardess.

06:26.177 --> 06:27.721
You will.

06:27.762 --> 06:29.514
I'll come down with you.

06:29.556 --> 06:31.016
How long have you been involved
in all this noise, then?

06:31.057 --> 06:32.559
Four years, I think.

06:32.600 --> 06:33.560
Yeah, same.

06:33.601 --> 06:34.644
Where are you from?

06:34.686 --> 06:35.979
I'm from Bahamas, Nassau.

06:36.021 --> 06:38.565
-Oh, beautiful.
-Yeah.

06:38.606 --> 06:42.068
I was Miss Bahamas 2013.
But I don't tell people.

06:42.110 --> 06:44.070
I did a Miss Bahamas pageant.

06:44.112 --> 06:46.948
-Wow.
-Especially yachties.

06:46.990 --> 06:48.533
Like, they find out
I was in a pageant,

06:48.575 --> 06:50.493
they're just like,
I'm your boss.

06:50.535 --> 06:53.788
Okay, I'll be the Cinderella
with the broom, that's fine.

06:53.830 --> 06:56.499
I'm still pretty; you're not.
So, it's okay.

06:59.169 --> 07:00.462
Hey there, I'm Lloyd.

07:00.503 --> 07:01.755
-Lloyd? Malia.
-Yeah.

07:01.796 --> 07:03.048
-Nice to meet you.
-Nice to meet you.

07:04.966 --> 07:06.926
We got sh-- to do.

07:06.968 --> 07:08.887
Cool, now there's three of us.

07:08.928 --> 07:10.472
On it.

07:10.513 --> 07:11.848
Possibly another Brit.

07:11.890 --> 07:13.016
Oh!

07:13.058 --> 07:14.934
My last boat is all British.

07:14.976 --> 07:16.770
Well, thankfully you already
know the British, so I'm fine.

07:16.811 --> 07:18.104
-Yeah.
-My ex-boyfriend's British.

07:18.146 --> 07:20.190
Oh, no, I'm sorry.

07:20.231 --> 07:23.276
The break-up with Tom
has really taken a toll on me.

07:23.318 --> 07:27.072
He was someone that
I thought was a forever.

07:27.113 --> 07:29.783
I thought I was in love.

07:29.824 --> 07:31.618
I just wanna put my head down
and work for a bit,

07:31.659 --> 07:32.911
and it's just that
tough period

07:32.952 --> 07:35.497
where you just gotta
figure sh-- out.

07:35.538 --> 07:36.956
But I will.

07:36.998 --> 07:39.000
That's yachting.

07:39.042 --> 07:40.001
-Hey, how's it going?
-Hello, buddy, I'm Lloyd.

07:40.043 --> 07:41.169
-Dave.
-Hey.

07:41.211 --> 07:42.295
-Nice to meet you.
-And you, fella.

07:42.337 --> 07:43.672
How do you say your name?

07:43.713 --> 07:44.673
-"Muzi."
-"Muzi."

07:44.714 --> 07:46.299
Yeah...

07:46.341 --> 07:47.300
And here's your bosun, Malia.

07:47.342 --> 07:48.677
-Hi, there.
-Hi!

07:48.718 --> 07:49.678
-Z.
-Z, Malia, nice to meet you.

07:49.719 --> 07:51.054
Nice to meet you.

07:51.096 --> 07:52.597
Z, whenever you're ready,
just get changed

07:52.639 --> 07:54.140
and me and the guys
are on the sundeck.

07:54.182 --> 07:55.725
-Awesome, lovely.
-Yeah.

07:55.767 --> 07:56.768
See you then.

08:20.333 --> 08:22.002
-I'm Katie. Oh sh--.
-Hi.

08:22.043 --> 08:24.129
-I'm Courtney, nice to meet you.
-Nice to meet you.

08:24.170 --> 08:25.755
So, you're from the UK?

08:25.797 --> 08:27.090
Yes, from Wales.

08:27.132 --> 08:28.550
-Hey.
-How's it going?

08:28.591 --> 08:29.759
-Dave.
-Mzi, nice to meet you.

08:29.801 --> 08:30.760
-Nice to meet you.
-Hey, Z.

08:30.802 --> 08:32.137
Hey.

08:32.178 --> 08:33.221
Sorry our introduction
was brief, but...

08:37.392 --> 08:38.601
No worries.

08:38.643 --> 08:40.687
Yeah, it might get a little hot.

08:43.064 --> 08:45.066
Idiot.

08:45.108 --> 08:46.234
Wipe it gently.

08:46.276 --> 08:47.944
-Soap and water, right?
-Yeah.

08:47.986 --> 08:49.112
We're just starting
with the wash-down.

08:52.073 --> 08:54.034
Nice,
is this your first boat, or?

08:54.075 --> 08:55.702
First big boat.

08:55.744 --> 08:56.828
-Nice, okay, cool.
-Yeah.

08:58.830 --> 09:00.665
-Oh...
-But yeah, just...

09:00.707 --> 09:02.250
Sorry, I should have
gauged that better.

09:02.292 --> 09:03.918
I guess... yeah.

09:03.960 --> 09:05.837
I love the notebook.

09:05.879 --> 09:08.048
Like, I didn't realize
he was that green.

09:08.089 --> 09:11.718
This means I can teach him
like I was taught.

09:11.760 --> 09:13.053
We've just come
this full circle,

09:13.094 --> 09:14.971
so that's pretty special to me.

09:16.931 --> 09:18.224
<i>All crew, all crew.</i>

09:18.266 --> 09:19.726
Ow, [bleep].

09:19.768 --> 09:21.144
Please meet me
in the main salon.

09:21.186 --> 09:22.312
Copy.

09:22.354 --> 09:24.647
-Hi.
-Hi!

09:24.689 --> 09:25.690
-Hi, Courtney.
-Lexi, nice to meet you.

09:25.732 --> 09:26.733
Nice to meet you.

09:26.775 --> 09:27.984
What's up, man, I'm Mat.

09:28.026 --> 09:28.985
Yeah, Lloyd, nice
to meet you, man.

09:29.027 --> 09:29.986
Lloyd.

09:30.028 --> 09:31.237
All right, welcome.

09:31.279 --> 09:32.364
We're beginning
our charter season,

09:32.405 --> 09:33.740
I love your energy, it's up.

09:33.782 --> 09:35.241
If you want a career in this,

09:35.283 --> 09:37.744
and this is really,
truly your passion,

09:37.786 --> 09:39.788
I'm here to help
make that happen.

09:39.829 --> 09:42.707
We just wanna stay within
the guidelines of protocol.

09:42.749 --> 09:44.292
Injuries...

09:44.334 --> 09:46.294
if any guest or you guys
are injured in any way,

09:46.336 --> 09:47.962
I wanna be the first
to know about it.

09:48.004 --> 09:51.049
If any of you are
on any prescribed medication,

09:51.091 --> 09:52.717
we need to log it.

09:52.759 --> 09:55.845
So, no drugs, and
no drinking while on charter.

09:57.138 --> 09:58.765
Well, it's kinda funny.

09:58.807 --> 10:00.225
Alex is the chief engineer,

10:00.266 --> 10:01.351
Marten is the chief officer,

10:01.393 --> 10:03.269
and Jake is our second engineer.

10:03.311 --> 10:04.646
So, that's our team.

10:04.688 --> 10:06.231
Do you like the boat?

10:06.272 --> 10:07.273
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

10:07.315 --> 10:09.651
It reminds me of Titanic inside.

10:09.693 --> 10:10.819
Oh!

10:10.860 --> 10:12.028
You've been on the Titanic?

10:12.070 --> 10:13.363
-Yeah, all the time.
-How was it?

10:13.405 --> 10:15.407
Lady Michelle was
designed for charter.

10:15.448 --> 10:17.701
It's a solid vessel,
it's elegant.

10:17.742 --> 10:19.244
I like to say it's
sort of like Disneyworld...

10:19.285 --> 10:21.079
you never see them take
the garbage out.

10:21.121 --> 10:23.289
There's a lot of stairs on
the boat, so the crew

10:23.331 --> 10:26.292
can go through each deck without
being seen by the client.

10:26.334 --> 10:27.919
It's gonna be
a lot of work for them.

10:27.961 --> 10:29.170
Tomorrow, our charter starts,

10:29.212 --> 10:30.755
so let's get our
boat turned around

10:30.797 --> 10:31.923
and get ready for tomorrow.

10:31.965 --> 10:33.133
All right.

10:33.174 --> 10:34.300
-Sounds good.
-You're free!

10:34.342 --> 10:35.760
-Nice.
-Woo!

10:35.802 --> 10:37.137
Okay, let's do it,
girls, come on.

10:37.178 --> 10:39.806
So, let's start
with the house, and then...

10:39.848 --> 10:41.850
-Roger.
-Exterior, interior.

10:41.891 --> 10:43.143
We're gonna
jump straight into it.

10:43.184 --> 10:44.144
Okay, cool.

10:44.185 --> 10:45.395
The boat's quite dusty.

10:48.982 --> 10:50.817
Actually... [bleep].

10:50.859 --> 10:53.695
All crew, all crew, I believe
we have provisions on the dock.

10:55.196 --> 10:56.698
Oh, that's a big truck.

10:58.199 --> 10:59.909
That's a lot, huh?

10:59.951 --> 11:01.036
What is that?

11:02.996 --> 11:04.456
So, that whole truck full?

11:04.497 --> 11:07.292
Never really seen
anything like this.

11:07.334 --> 11:08.418
Of course it's a red flag.

11:12.213 --> 11:13.173
Coming up...

11:13.214 --> 11:15.884
That was terrible.

11:15.925 --> 11:17.344
I have failed them.

11:17.385 --> 11:19.512
-We're on a mega-yacht!
-I get it.

11:19.554 --> 11:21.056
-Sorry, I'm...
-We're on a mega-yacht!

11:26.061 --> 11:27.520
All crew, all crew, I believe
we have provisions on the dock.

11:29.272 --> 11:30.774
So, that whole truck full?

11:30.815 --> 11:32.025
Dear God.

11:34.861 --> 11:36.363
That's a lot, huh?

11:36.404 --> 11:38.865
I've never really seen
anything like this.

11:38.907 --> 11:40.367
What is that?

11:40.408 --> 11:41.868
I thought it was going to
be a sh-- show

11:41.910 --> 11:43.370
before the provisions arrived.

11:43.411 --> 11:45.288
As soon as I see these pallets,

11:45.330 --> 11:49.250
I've probably over-ordered
and [bleep] now I'm stressed.

11:49.292 --> 11:50.251
Now the fun starts.

11:50.293 --> 11:51.795
Oh, yeah.

11:54.130 --> 11:56.508
Sweet.

11:56.549 --> 11:57.801
Where do you want these to go?

11:57.842 --> 11:59.844
Straight into the main deck.

11:59.886 --> 12:01.471
Phew, saved!

12:03.848 --> 12:04.933
You know, it's the first order.

12:06.351 --> 12:07.602
Yeah.

12:07.644 --> 12:08.603
You don't need to go to
the gym, eh?

12:08.645 --> 12:10.021
No.

12:10.063 --> 12:11.022
I have some cling
film and stuff,

12:11.064 --> 12:12.023
do you reckon this is yours?

12:12.065 --> 12:13.817
I reckon it is.

12:13.858 --> 12:17.070
I first started yachting as,
like, a stewardess/nanny.

12:17.112 --> 12:19.197
Then I got a job on a 60-meter.

12:19.239 --> 12:21.991
That's where I became
the queen of laundry.

12:22.033 --> 12:23.118
Have you been on
a boat recently?

12:23.159 --> 12:25.120
Yeah, back home,
in Rhode Island.

12:25.161 --> 12:26.371
Have you done a season there?

12:26.413 --> 12:28.456
No, just two Med,
one Caribbean.

12:42.554 --> 12:44.139
Thanks.

12:44.180 --> 12:47.058
Holy sh--, I hope
that was all season's.

12:47.100 --> 12:49.352
Holy crap, you have
enough space?

12:49.394 --> 12:50.562
It looks like a
lot, doesn't it?

12:50.603 --> 12:52.480
It does.

12:52.522 --> 12:54.899
Deck, deck, we'll have a meeting
on bridge deck aft, please.

12:54.941 --> 12:57.027
<i>Interior, can you meet me</i>
<i>in the main salon, please?</i>

12:58.069 --> 12:59.946
Um, okay, guys, cool.

12:59.988 --> 13:01.489
So, I've seen your guys' CVs.

13:01.531 --> 13:04.492
Lexi, I'm gonna go
with you second stew.

13:04.534 --> 13:06.036
You've got slightly more
experience.

13:06.077 --> 13:07.287
Yeah.

13:07.328 --> 13:08.997
As far as the
lead deckhand goes,

13:09.039 --> 13:11.541
I will name one when I see fit.

13:11.583 --> 13:14.294
It's not just experience
to me on deck, it's attitude.

13:14.336 --> 13:15.670
I've learned my lesson

13:15.712 --> 13:18.131
choosing a lead deckhand
based off of CVs.

13:18.173 --> 13:21.384
I obviously feel a lot more
comfortable in my role as bosun,

13:21.426 --> 13:24.012
but generally I'm just
hoping it's a fun season.

13:24.054 --> 13:25.638
Obviously, keep it professional,

13:25.680 --> 13:27.307
but I don't think you
guys are gonna be

13:27.349 --> 13:29.934
that big of
troublemakers, hopefully.

13:29.976 --> 13:32.062
I'll have you on lates,
you on earlies.

13:32.103 --> 13:34.022
Yeah.

13:34.064 --> 13:35.065
I'll stay on mids so I'm up
with the guests all the time.

13:35.106 --> 13:36.608
I do wanna rotate.

13:36.649 --> 13:39.152
I'm not gonna, like, leave you
on a sh-- shift.

13:39.194 --> 13:43.323
I'm not one of these, like,
crazy stews that comes in and...

13:43.365 --> 13:45.033
Oh, that's a relief.

13:45.075 --> 13:48.119
I have a love-hate relationship
with chief stewardess.

13:48.161 --> 13:51.581
Like, when they graduate
to that rank,

13:51.623 --> 13:56.044
the lazy bitch mentality just
seeps through their veins.

13:56.086 --> 13:58.672
But just don't tell me what to
do, I have to do my own thing.

13:58.713 --> 14:00.548
Respectfully.

14:00.590 --> 14:03.385
Let's just get all the cabins
done, smash out the salons,

14:03.426 --> 14:05.011
because, like,
this is horrendous.

14:05.053 --> 14:06.638
Yeah.

14:06.680 --> 14:08.556
So, let's just dry this and
then go from the bow back.

14:08.598 --> 14:09.557
-Let's do it.
-Yes.

14:09.599 --> 14:11.059
Okay.

14:17.232 --> 14:18.483
This is so much.

14:18.525 --> 14:20.068
[bleep]

14:20.110 --> 14:21.361
We're gonna give her
a whore's bath.

14:21.403 --> 14:22.362
-Yeah.
-Yep.

14:22.404 --> 14:23.697
What?

14:25.740 --> 14:27.992
I'm coming downstairs.
I'm coming up the stairs.

14:28.034 --> 14:30.328
Corner.
----ing hell.

14:30.370 --> 14:33.456
The walk-ins are two floors down
on a windy staircase.

14:35.333 --> 14:37.585
I'm thinking about the guests
arriving in 24 hours,

14:37.627 --> 14:39.170
let alone where am
I gonna put this stuff.

14:39.212 --> 14:40.714
I need to prep.

14:40.755 --> 14:42.340
I'm coming up and down,
like, five times, all right?

14:44.300 --> 14:46.261
Lloyd, how long have you
been doing yachting?

14:46.302 --> 14:48.221
I started off a couple of years
ago doing yacht deliveries.

14:48.263 --> 14:50.140
What were you doing before?

14:50.181 --> 14:52.267
I was a European coach driver.

14:52.308 --> 14:53.476
Yeah, nice!

14:53.518 --> 14:54.978
Yeah.

14:55.020 --> 14:57.063
I've drove in
42 different countries.

14:57.105 --> 14:59.274
One time I was running
a tour in Russia,

14:59.315 --> 15:01.609
and this guy came up to
me and he was just like,

15:01.651 --> 15:04.070
"You look like
the Nicolas Cage."

15:04.112 --> 15:05.613
And they made me a
T-shirt that said,

15:05.655 --> 15:07.449
"You look like
the Nicholas Cage,"

15:07.490 --> 15:10.326
and I had to wear it every night
out for the rest of the tour.

15:10.368 --> 15:12.120
This looks more like
I can do this for a job.

15:12.162 --> 15:13.455
Yeah.

15:15.498 --> 15:18.585
We'll use the pillows,
just not the day cover.

15:18.626 --> 15:19.753
Okay.

15:19.794 --> 15:22.047
Katie, Malia, and Mathew.

15:22.088 --> 15:23.089
Ow [bleep]!

15:23.131 --> 15:24.591
Please meet me in the crew mess

15:24.632 --> 15:27.344
for our very first
preference sheet meeting.

15:27.385 --> 15:29.012
<i>-Copy that.</i>
<i>-Copy.</i>

15:30.513 --> 15:33.099
So, Terez is
a successful marketing

15:33.141 --> 15:34.517
and sales professional.

15:34.559 --> 15:37.520
Her husband, Lee, works
in real estate in Austin.

15:37.562 --> 15:40.482
Co-primaries are Clint
and his fiancée, Karry.

15:40.523 --> 15:42.108
Clint and Karry were forced

15:42.150 --> 15:44.736
to cancel their
original wedding plans.

15:44.778 --> 15:47.197
However, this trip would be
perfect to have

15:47.238 --> 15:51.493
a beautiful, intimate ceremony
with their closest friends.

15:51.534 --> 15:53.370
All of the guests would
like to celebrate

15:53.411 --> 15:54.704
Jordan's 40th birthday,

15:54.746 --> 15:57.082
followed by a neon dance party.

15:57.123 --> 15:58.333
They would like to have

15:58.375 --> 16:01.378
a bachelor and
bachelorette party, woo!

16:01.419 --> 16:02.796
Clint and Karry would like
to get married

16:02.837 --> 16:05.840
with Captain Sandy
officiating on day three.

16:05.882 --> 16:08.134
-That's cool.
-Yeah.

16:08.176 --> 16:10.345
I love weddings, but this
will be my first wedding

16:10.387 --> 16:12.389
I've done alone, yeah.

16:12.430 --> 16:15.225
You know, my parents
got married, divorced,

16:15.266 --> 16:17.394
and then remarried years later.

16:17.435 --> 16:19.062
I was conceived
during the divorce,

16:19.104 --> 16:21.064
so they call me
their bastard child.

16:22.524 --> 16:24.484
Smash it out so we
can be ready for the wedding.

16:24.526 --> 16:26.236
-Cool, thank you.
-Cool.

16:29.739 --> 16:31.866
These stairs are gonna kill me.

16:31.908 --> 16:33.535
Yeah, dust, like, everywhere.
It's quite bad.

16:33.576 --> 16:35.120
Okay.

16:38.248 --> 16:40.417
The quicker we do this,
the quicker we can finish.

16:42.752 --> 16:43.712
We are actually done now.

16:43.753 --> 16:45.171
Cool.

16:45.213 --> 16:47.215
Okay, just this,
and then it's done.

16:49.592 --> 16:50.593
[bleep]

16:52.762 --> 16:54.139
Yay, dinner.

16:54.180 --> 16:56.891
-Oh, wow.
-So hungry!

16:56.933 --> 16:58.893
So, is everyone single?

16:58.935 --> 17:00.645
Single as a Pringle, baby.

17:00.687 --> 17:01.730
Was that a "yes"
from everyone, or...

17:01.771 --> 17:03.189
-Yes.
-Yes.

17:06.776 --> 17:07.736
-Really?
-Mm.

17:07.777 --> 17:09.404
I love Jack.

17:09.446 --> 17:12.282
Like, he actually got
my face tattooed on his arm.

17:12.323 --> 17:14.325
It had been, like, 10 days
of us knowing each other.

17:17.537 --> 17:19.706
I was just, like,
what the actual [bleep].

17:22.375 --> 17:23.752
We were just so young.

17:23.793 --> 17:26.296
It's too passionate,
never gonna work.

17:26.338 --> 17:27.797
But, like, at least
we were together

17:27.839 --> 17:29.424
for about a year and a half.

17:29.466 --> 17:31.718
You know, it kinda
makes it worth it, right?

17:34.721 --> 17:36.306
I have all these books
about being calm.

17:36.348 --> 17:38.391
One's actually called
"Calm the [bleep] Down."

17:45.523 --> 17:47.275
-So, I sleep in my underwear.
-Don't worry.

17:50.653 --> 17:51.654
It's time.

17:54.324 --> 17:56.326
True love shines through.

18:00.830 --> 18:02.332
[snoring]

18:13.343 --> 18:14.719
I didn't sleep.

18:14.761 --> 18:15.970
Full of nerves.

18:16.012 --> 18:18.306
Thinking menus,
thinking wedding,

18:18.348 --> 18:20.517
thinking everything.

18:20.558 --> 18:21.851
I'm not prepped at all.

18:26.856 --> 18:28.358
[snoring]

18:35.281 --> 18:36.324
Good morning.

18:36.366 --> 18:38.660
-Day one.
-Day one.

18:38.702 --> 18:40.328
Ow, my ----ing knee!

18:45.792 --> 18:46.876
Mother [bleep].

18:46.918 --> 18:50.255
Whew... oof. Ow.

18:50.296 --> 18:51.297
Captain Sandy, Mat.

18:52.549 --> 18:54.509
Copy, I'm on my way.

18:54.551 --> 18:56.011
Oh, my God.

18:56.052 --> 18:58.263
I'd like to hit the windows,

18:58.304 --> 19:00.348
and then getting, like,
cushions and everything out

19:00.390 --> 19:01.683
for the first time.

19:03.059 --> 19:04.519
Get it done.

19:04.561 --> 19:06.813
We need to smash this
out ----ing quick.

19:06.855 --> 19:08.231
I hurt my knee last night.

19:08.273 --> 19:09.566
Okay.

19:10.692 --> 19:12.027
Say that again?

19:12.068 --> 19:13.695
I don't feel like
I can do this properly.

19:13.737 --> 19:14.738
What do you mean?

19:20.618 --> 19:22.412
Even with our help?

19:22.454 --> 19:25.665
It's not gonna be
the same with that.

19:25.707 --> 19:28.376
And the fact I didn't sleep,

19:28.418 --> 19:31.713
and, like, trying to figure out
the kitchen on the first day,

19:31.755 --> 19:34.341
with that handicap...

19:34.382 --> 19:35.383
I'm...

19:38.553 --> 19:40.555
-So, what are you saying?
-...freaking out.

19:40.597 --> 19:42.474
-Okay, so what...
-I don't know what to do.

19:42.515 --> 19:43.683
I can't do this.

19:45.602 --> 19:46.853
I can't do this with this.

19:50.315 --> 19:51.441
I'm freaked out.

19:54.527 --> 19:55.570
Coming up...

19:55.612 --> 19:56.654
I got some news to break to you.

19:56.696 --> 19:57.822
Oh, no!

19:57.864 --> 19:59.657
I just ask that
you bear with us.

20:06.664 --> 20:07.040
You need me?

20:08.166 --> 20:09.501
I hurt my knee last night.

20:09.542 --> 20:10.794
Okay.

20:12.420 --> 20:15.757
You need to tell me
what it is you want to do.

20:15.799 --> 20:17.884
-I'm freaked out.
-Okay. So, what...

20:17.926 --> 20:19.803
I don't know what to do.

20:19.844 --> 20:22.389
I can't do this.

20:22.430 --> 20:24.015
I can't do this with this.

20:24.057 --> 20:25.809
Sorry.

20:25.850 --> 20:27.852
-Um...
-All right.

20:31.731 --> 20:33.024
-Is it really painful?
-Yeah.

20:33.066 --> 20:34.776
Like, you can't
even stand on it?

20:34.818 --> 20:36.695
Yeah, that's my livelihood,
standing on my foot.

20:38.655 --> 20:39.989
I don't want it
to get worse, you know?

20:40.031 --> 20:41.825
I get it.

20:41.866 --> 20:44.077
I don't know what the [bleep]
it is, but it's, like...

20:44.119 --> 20:45.662
it doesn't feel right.

20:45.704 --> 20:47.664
Well, I'll have Malia
send you someone.

20:47.706 --> 20:48.915
Okay.

20:57.048 --> 20:58.967
I'll come right back.

21:03.680 --> 21:05.849
Put your sleeve back,
and that's like a pin,

21:05.890 --> 21:07.851
-and it should clip on there.
-Oh, okay.

21:07.892 --> 21:10.937
If you do it wrong you get
soaked, but it's all good fun.

21:10.979 --> 21:12.897
Once it fills,
it's literally on, off.

21:12.939 --> 21:14.691
Okay, cool.

21:14.733 --> 21:16.192
I'd like to think
I'm quite caring by nature.

21:16.234 --> 21:17.736
I was born in Italy, and

21:17.777 --> 21:19.654
I didn't meet my dad till
I was, like, 17.

21:19.696 --> 21:22.699
Like, my best father figures
have been guys I've worked with.

21:22.741 --> 21:24.451
It was engineers on boats.

21:24.492 --> 21:26.578
So, I wanna try and help
as many people as I can,

21:26.619 --> 21:28.163
and hopefully they take
it forward as well.

21:29.914 --> 21:31.708
So, we're down a chef.

21:31.750 --> 21:33.168
What?

21:33.209 --> 21:34.461
Well, he's freaking out
because he's hurt,

21:34.502 --> 21:35.795
and he wants to do a great job

21:35.837 --> 21:37.547
and that's his reputation.

21:37.589 --> 21:38.673
Of course.

21:38.715 --> 21:39.883
Yeah, I know.

21:39.924 --> 21:40.884
[bleep]
What did he do?

21:40.925 --> 21:42.552
His knee.

21:42.594 --> 21:44.095
So, Captain Sandy's
asking one of us

21:44.137 --> 21:46.431
to kind of help and be,
like, a sous chef.

21:46.473 --> 21:47.849
Do you want me to go
to the galley to help?

21:47.891 --> 21:49.184
Have you done all the rooms?

21:49.225 --> 21:50.435
Yeah.

21:50.477 --> 21:51.478
[bleep], okay.

21:51.519 --> 21:52.937
Sous chefs.

21:52.979 --> 21:54.939
We're just gonna have
to pitch in and help.

21:54.981 --> 21:57.067
-Yeah.
-Sh--.

21:57.108 --> 21:59.110
I don't even have time to
be angry or upset about this.

21:59.152 --> 22:02.197
It's gonna affect
the whole operation of the boat.

22:02.238 --> 22:04.032
Did I want my third stew
to go in there and do that?

22:04.074 --> 22:05.784
Absolutely not.

22:05.825 --> 22:08.953
We don't have a choice,
so we've gotta keep going.

22:08.995 --> 22:09.954
It's only day one.

22:09.996 --> 22:11.456
I know.

22:11.498 --> 22:13.833
[phone ringing]

22:13.875 --> 22:15.960
Does anyone have any
restaurant experience?

22:16.002 --> 22:17.462
This is Captain Sandy.

22:17.504 --> 22:18.755
I have a chef with
an injured knee,

22:18.797 --> 22:21.174
and I was hoping
I could get him an MRI.

22:21.216 --> 22:22.717
It's our first day of charter,

22:22.759 --> 22:24.552
and I'm ready
to vomit in my mouth.

22:24.594 --> 22:26.596
When someone comes to me
with an injury,

22:26.638 --> 22:29.015
I cannot determine whether
they're injured or not.

22:29.057 --> 22:30.475
I have to follow protocol.

22:30.517 --> 22:31.935
All right, thank you.

22:31.976 --> 22:33.103
I can't just call and
get another yacht chef

22:33.144 --> 22:34.479
because of COVID.

22:34.521 --> 22:35.855
They have to quarantine
for seven days.

22:35.897 --> 22:38.233
I don't know
what I'm going to do.

22:41.027 --> 22:45.240
All right, cushions are out,
bridge deck is set up.

22:45.281 --> 22:46.866
Let's do this.

22:46.908 --> 22:48.743
So, there's a toasting machine
down there,

22:48.785 --> 22:50.078
just make them
for the whole crew.

22:50.120 --> 22:52.247
-Yeah.
-Hello!

22:52.288 --> 22:54.040
Do you need my help?

22:54.082 --> 22:55.291
Do you wanna sort
out the fruit plate?

22:55.333 --> 22:56.292
Sure.

22:56.334 --> 22:57.961
How's your knee?

22:58.003 --> 23:00.296
I don't know if this is
minutes or temperature.

23:00.338 --> 23:01.756
It's a waffle machine.

23:07.178 --> 23:08.888
You gonna make it
through this charter?

23:08.930 --> 23:10.640
-No.
-No?

23:10.682 --> 23:12.809
Mm-mmm.

23:12.851 --> 23:13.810
Heh.

23:13.852 --> 23:14.978
<i>Malia, Malia, Lloyd.</i>

23:15.020 --> 23:16.271
Toasties are just
coming out now.

23:16.312 --> 23:17.522
Copy, thank you.

23:17.564 --> 23:18.523
How are you going in here?

23:18.565 --> 23:19.524
Almost done.

23:19.566 --> 23:20.859
Oh sh--.

23:22.193 --> 23:24.571
Hey, Mat,
we're gonna get your MRI.

23:24.612 --> 23:25.822
This sucks.

23:25.864 --> 23:27.198
Um, so...

23:27.240 --> 23:29.159
[fanfare plays]

23:29.200 --> 23:31.286
Perfect distraction.

23:31.327 --> 23:33.038
Two-zero minutes
till main salon.

23:40.170 --> 23:41.129
We gotta rally.

23:41.171 --> 23:42.756
Positive vibes.

23:42.797 --> 23:45.091
All crew, all crew,
come into the main salon.

23:45.133 --> 23:49.012
<i>We have 30 minutes</i>
<i>until guest arrival.</i>

23:49.054 --> 23:52.182
<i>Interior, interior,</i>
<i>the boat looks amazing!</i>

23:52.223 --> 23:55.310
Every chief stew has
a way of doing things.

23:55.352 --> 23:57.979
I can't start the day
without making the bed.

23:58.021 --> 24:00.315
I can't stand wet towels
on the ground.

24:00.357 --> 24:02.067
Like, when guys get out
of the shower

24:02.108 --> 24:04.569
and they'd don't use
a ----ing bath mat,

24:04.611 --> 24:05.945
Oh, my God,
that drives me insane.

24:06.946 --> 24:09.616
Right, looking sharp.

24:09.657 --> 24:11.993
Unfortunately, our chef
has injured himself.

24:12.035 --> 24:14.829
We're gonna leave him at
the dock to go get an MRI.

24:15.955 --> 24:17.707
So, our chef has prepared lunch.

24:17.749 --> 24:20.126
For dinner,
he'll come back to the boat.

24:20.168 --> 24:22.712
We're on the first day of
charter on a chefless boat.

24:27.842 --> 24:29.135
Don't give up.

24:29.177 --> 24:31.721
Okay?

24:31.763 --> 24:32.889
Let's do this!

24:32.931 --> 24:34.265
Deck crew, we're good?

24:34.307 --> 24:35.809
-Yeah.
-All right.

24:35.850 --> 24:37.977
When the guests come on,
once we do luggage,

24:38.019 --> 24:41.398
our sole attention is
getting the boat off the dock.

24:41.439 --> 24:43.149
As soon as you meet them,
one of you can do

24:43.191 --> 24:44.818
the welcome towels and one
of you can do the drinks.

24:44.859 --> 24:45.819
Okay.

24:45.860 --> 24:46.986
This is charter life.

24:47.028 --> 24:48.655
Okay, here they come.

24:48.697 --> 24:49.823
Woo!

24:49.864 --> 24:51.825
[shouting]

24:51.866 --> 24:53.159
-Welcome.
-Hi.

24:53.201 --> 24:54.244
I'm Sandy, the captain.

24:54.285 --> 24:55.662
I'm Terez, nice to meet you.

24:55.704 --> 24:56.913
-Hi, I'm Katie.
-Nice to meet you.

24:56.955 --> 24:58.248
-Terez.
-Hi, Courtney.

24:58.289 --> 24:59.958
-Nice to meet you.
-Lloyd.

25:00.000 --> 25:01.960
-Oh, yeah.
-Z, nice to meet you.

25:02.002 --> 25:04.754
Welcome, and I'm hoping the
weather holds out for you.

25:04.796 --> 25:07.340
Our chief stewardess,
Katie, is gonna show you around

25:07.382 --> 25:08.842
the vessel, and then
we'll take off.

25:08.883 --> 25:10.260
-Sweet.
-All right.

25:10.301 --> 25:11.344
Let's do it!

25:11.386 --> 25:12.762
When I first got into yachting,

25:12.804 --> 25:14.139
I was working
in the engine room,

25:14.180 --> 25:15.390
so there's a little bit
of apprehension

25:15.432 --> 25:17.100
for the first charter.

25:17.142 --> 25:19.102
Charter yacht guests are gonna
be much more demanding

25:19.144 --> 25:20.854
than what I'm used
to driving coaches,

25:20.895 --> 25:22.939
but I'm feeling fresh,
ready to go.

25:22.981 --> 25:25.150
Woohoo!

25:25.191 --> 25:26.776
Z, along starboard side.

25:26.818 --> 25:27.944
-Cool.
-Yeah.

25:27.986 --> 25:28.987
Wait, how do you say
it in Croatian?

25:29.029 --> 25:30.030
-Hvala.
-Hvala.

25:30.071 --> 25:31.906
Yes, correct.

25:31.948 --> 25:32.949
So, welcome aboard, guys.

25:32.991 --> 25:34.451
Thank you.

25:34.492 --> 25:36.369
I'm gonna start with
a tour of the boat.

25:36.411 --> 25:38.079
Have you guys been
to Croatia before?

25:38.121 --> 25:39.664
No, this is the first time.

25:39.706 --> 25:41.916
Oh, it's amazing here.

25:41.958 --> 25:44.336
This is our bridge deck aft.

25:44.377 --> 25:46.212
This will be
the main dining area.

25:46.254 --> 25:48.131
Obviously, weather-dependent.

25:48.173 --> 25:50.175
We're from Texas,
we'll bring the sun.

25:50.216 --> 25:51.176
Chicken, chicken?

25:51.217 --> 25:52.761
Chicken and chickpea.

25:54.304 --> 25:55.347
Sundeck aft.

25:55.388 --> 25:56.806
There we go, there's the sun.

25:56.848 --> 25:58.683
-This, you just give it a stir.
-Okay.

25:58.725 --> 25:59.976
We've got another
dining as well.

26:00.018 --> 26:00.977
Amazing.

26:01.019 --> 26:02.312
We have a big-ass Jacuzzi.

26:02.354 --> 26:03.980
It's Texas-size.

26:04.022 --> 26:05.065
This plate?

26:05.106 --> 26:06.191
This is quinoa,
that is lentils.

26:06.232 --> 26:07.984
Okay.

26:08.026 --> 26:09.069
And then we'll come
through to the primary suite.

26:09.110 --> 26:10.445
Oh, boy.

26:10.487 --> 26:12.197
We have two bathrooms.

26:12.238 --> 26:13.740
-Terez.
-Girl!

26:13.782 --> 26:17.327
Woo, child, steamroll here.

26:17.369 --> 26:18.870
I mean, if you want,
you can all sleep in here.

26:18.912 --> 26:19.954
Yeah.

26:19.996 --> 26:21.748
Saves me getting
the cabins done.

26:21.790 --> 26:24.834
Ugh, come on, Mathew,
hang the [bleep] in there.

26:29.464 --> 26:31.007
Shorts, red shoes.

26:35.303 --> 26:36.429
She's like, "I've never
been through

26:36.471 --> 26:38.014
so many bottles
on a walkthrough."

26:38.056 --> 26:40.183
-Well...
-I'm into it.

26:40.225 --> 26:42.394
If this was me,
I'd be doing the same thing.

26:42.435 --> 26:45.230
Then we come down
to the lower guest area.

26:46.773 --> 26:48.900
So we've got a twin
and then a double.

26:48.942 --> 26:50.276
I'm gonna nail my head
on these things.

26:50.318 --> 26:51.361
I know.

26:51.403 --> 26:53.738
This is Captain Sandy's haven.

26:53.780 --> 26:54.739
This is where the magic happens.

26:54.781 --> 26:56.074
-Yes, it is.
-Yay!

26:56.116 --> 26:57.992
-Since you're all in here...
-Yeah.

26:58.034 --> 26:59.202
I got some news to break to you.

26:59.244 --> 27:00.412
Our chef injured himself.

27:00.453 --> 27:04.082
Oh!

27:04.124 --> 27:06.251
We are leaving him at
the dock to go get an MRI.

27:06.292 --> 27:07.377
Oh, no!

27:07.419 --> 27:09.462
He did prepare a lunch

27:09.504 --> 27:12.340
that we're gonna try
to make it happen.

27:12.382 --> 27:14.050
-There will be no chef?
-No chef?

27:14.092 --> 27:15.218
Sorry.

27:15.260 --> 27:17.053
Oh, my God.

27:25.270 --> 27:26.187
-Since you're all in here...
-Yeah.

27:27.480 --> 27:28.606
I got some news
to break to you.

27:28.648 --> 27:29.983
Our chef injured himself.

27:30.025 --> 27:31.443
Oh!

27:31.484 --> 27:32.944
We are leaving him
at the dock to go get an MRI.

27:32.986 --> 27:34.279
Oh, no!

27:34.320 --> 27:36.281
-There will be no chef?
-No chef?

27:36.322 --> 27:38.158
Because of COVID,
our hands are tied.

27:38.199 --> 27:40.535
It isn't like I can
get another chef like that.

27:40.577 --> 27:42.829
You're gonna have to tip us,
if that's the case.

27:45.165 --> 27:47.167
In my entire career,
this has never happened to me.

27:47.208 --> 27:49.169
You know what,
we're gonna make it happen.

27:49.210 --> 27:50.170
-That's right, that's right.
-We're gonna make it happen.

27:50.211 --> 27:52.130
We could be ----ed.

27:52.172 --> 27:53.465
-Thank you, Sandy.
-Yeah, thank you.

27:53.506 --> 27:55.008
Cheers.

27:55.050 --> 27:56.092
So, coming off the
dock you're gonna

27:56.134 --> 27:57.260
be forward on the foredeck,

27:57.302 --> 27:58.887
you guys are gonna
be on the stern,

27:58.928 --> 28:00.305
so you can
start prepping your lines.

28:04.351 --> 28:06.019
Yeah, that's fine.

28:06.061 --> 28:07.020
All crew, all crew,
we're ready for departure.

28:07.062 --> 28:08.355
Copy.

28:08.396 --> 28:10.482
So, if we could do lunch,
I think, now,

28:10.523 --> 28:11.900
and then we want
to do water sports.

28:11.941 --> 28:12.901
Yeah.

28:12.942 --> 28:13.902
Okay, Malia, you ready?

28:13.943 --> 28:15.236
Captain Sandy, stand by.

28:15.278 --> 28:17.072
Oh sh--.

28:17.113 --> 28:18.448
They wanna go ahead
with lunch right away.

28:18.490 --> 28:20.158
Yep.

28:20.200 --> 28:21.159
Yeah.

28:21.201 --> 28:22.494
Yep.

28:22.535 --> 28:24.287
All right, lines
are prepped, you excited?

28:24.329 --> 28:26.122
Yeah, a little bit nervous.

28:26.164 --> 28:28.208
So, you can always have him come
over, and you can both do those.

28:28.249 --> 28:30.085
Of course.

28:30.126 --> 28:32.045
It's a little nerve-wracking,
docking as a new team,

28:32.087 --> 28:34.297
especially with
the size of the boat.

28:34.339 --> 28:37.092
One little mistake can
lead into a bigger one.

28:37.133 --> 28:38.593
Just take off, yeah, the top,

28:38.635 --> 28:40.011
and then just leave
similar to this one.

28:40.053 --> 28:41.596
All right, starboard forward.

28:41.638 --> 28:44.307
Oh, my God, love these.

28:46.267 --> 28:47.644
You can free up the line.

28:47.686 --> 28:49.396
Copy.

28:49.437 --> 28:50.939
Go, go.

28:50.980 --> 28:53.149
That is your two cross-backs
coming off now.

28:53.191 --> 28:54.359
All lines off.

28:54.401 --> 28:56.361
We can release this one,
go, go, go.

28:56.403 --> 28:59.322
That is all stern lines on deck.

28:59.364 --> 29:01.408
We're off, we're moving.

29:03.243 --> 29:06.121
Forty feet starboard midships
to dock,

29:06.162 --> 29:07.455
all clear off
your stern to swing.

29:07.497 --> 29:08.540
<i>Thank you, nice work.</i>

29:08.581 --> 29:10.917
[bleep] yeah, Z.

29:10.959 --> 29:13.044
You did it, boy.

29:13.086 --> 29:14.212
Go down for two hours.

29:14.254 --> 29:16.047
-Thank you.
-Pleasure.

29:16.089 --> 29:19.050
So, we've got a lentil and
octopus salad, quinoa salad.

29:19.092 --> 29:20.927
-Oh, beautiful!
-Mm!

29:20.969 --> 29:25.056
Some fresh chicken, we have some
falafels and a tzaziki sauce,

29:25.098 --> 29:27.267
and then we have a burrata
and heirloom salad.

29:27.308 --> 29:29.102
So, this is gonna be
the best lunch we have.

29:30.270 --> 29:31.479
Delicious.

29:31.521 --> 29:33.398
Mm, this is perfect...
light, filling.

29:33.440 --> 29:35.608
So, who's gonna cook for us?

29:35.650 --> 29:37.527
I think that's...
I think this one...

29:37.569 --> 29:39.571
I actually think this is mine
and that one's his.

29:39.612 --> 29:41.072
I did, like, cocktail
service at home,

29:41.114 --> 29:42.741
and one of my captain
friends was, like,

29:42.782 --> 29:45.535
how about you work on this
boat for me in Exuma?

29:45.577 --> 29:47.078
It was good money,
I'm on a yacht.

29:47.120 --> 29:48.663
I mean, can't hate that.

29:48.705 --> 29:50.957
But I really prefer
the days where someone

29:50.999 --> 29:53.418
handed me the champagne,
so yeah.

29:53.460 --> 29:54.419
They're gonna get a chef.

29:54.461 --> 29:55.462
Okay.

29:57.464 --> 29:59.341
Do you wanna help me
drop the anchors today?

29:59.382 --> 30:00.592
Yeah.

30:00.633 --> 30:02.093
You would wait for
her to tell you,

30:02.135 --> 30:03.094
or you would say
"ready at the anchor."

30:03.136 --> 30:04.596
You ask.

30:04.637 --> 30:06.014
When she says,
"Drop, drop, drop," let 'er rip.

30:06.056 --> 30:07.974
Being back here on the
Dalmatian Coast,

30:08.016 --> 30:09.434
based in Sibenik,

30:09.476 --> 30:12.270
it's more nature,
country, small village.

30:12.312 --> 30:13.271
I love that.

30:13.313 --> 30:14.314
How was lunch?

30:14.356 --> 30:15.607
The quinoa salad was bomb.

30:15.648 --> 30:16.733
It was great.

30:18.276 --> 30:19.319
-Yeah, of course.
-Thank you.

30:19.361 --> 30:20.695
-Two.
-Two espresso martinis?

30:20.737 --> 30:21.696
-Three.
-Same.

30:21.738 --> 30:22.781
Four?

30:22.822 --> 30:24.282
Just do a round for everybody.

30:26.659 --> 30:28.119
When I'm dealing
with demanding guests,

30:28.161 --> 30:30.789
I'm, like, a
pretty laid-back Kiwi.

30:30.830 --> 30:33.208
But sometimes I turn
into a stressed-out bitch,

30:33.249 --> 30:35.585
so, you know, whatever.
I'm not perfect.

30:35.627 --> 30:37.379
Hi.

30:37.420 --> 30:39.005
Yeah, we were told to put
some of the stuff in laundry?

30:39.047 --> 30:40.548
No, it wasn't in laundry,

30:40.590 --> 30:42.258
it just needs to be steamed,
everything's clean.

30:42.300 --> 30:43.426
But I have all my stuff
in there, so I need to change.

30:43.468 --> 30:45.095
Okay.

30:45.136 --> 30:46.429
I did already put some of it
in the washing machine,

30:46.471 --> 30:47.639
because she asked...

30:47.681 --> 30:49.265
Oh, nothing needs
to be washed...

30:49.307 --> 30:50.642
But okay, that's where
the confusion was.

30:50.684 --> 30:51.810
Anything that I haven't
put in bring up to you.

30:51.851 --> 30:54.479
-Okay.
-Okay.

30:54.521 --> 30:57.357
Oh, don't fly away!

31:02.195 --> 31:03.738
It's not been steamed!

31:13.623 --> 31:15.208
Let it go, drop the anchor.

31:15.250 --> 31:16.251
-You got it?
-Yeah.

31:16.292 --> 31:17.502
All right, I trust you.

31:17.544 --> 31:20.213
So, we have some
espresso martinis.

31:24.551 --> 31:27.303
Little more.

31:27.345 --> 31:28.430
That's good.

31:28.471 --> 31:29.723
Nice job, guys.

31:34.436 --> 31:36.521
I've only managed to
press these ones just so far.

31:36.563 --> 31:37.522
Thank you, Courtney.

31:37.564 --> 31:39.107
No problem.

31:39.149 --> 31:41.609
We have the rest of
the espresso martinis.

31:41.651 --> 31:44.195
Thank you.

31:44.237 --> 31:45.655
Oh, yeah, okay,
I heard about this.

31:45.697 --> 31:49.409
So, I'm gonna task you
with 100 glow sticks.

31:49.451 --> 31:51.661
Okay.

31:51.703 --> 31:53.413
These are like glasses
and all the things

31:53.455 --> 31:54.414
-that they made.
-Okay.

31:54.456 --> 31:56.207
Okay.

31:56.249 --> 31:57.208
So, I'm gonna hand those
to y'all for later tonight.

31:57.250 --> 31:58.251
Sure.

32:02.172 --> 32:03.381
There she is.

32:03.423 --> 32:04.841
Excuse me, no pictures,
please.

32:04.883 --> 32:06.176
Look at this beautifulness,
oh, my God.

32:06.217 --> 32:07.719
Ooh, is that a cave right there?

32:07.761 --> 32:10.347
Like, if you were Batman,
you would want that cave.

32:12.432 --> 32:14.225
Keep pulling.

32:20.398 --> 32:22.859
Okay, David's gonna
be your slide man.

32:22.901 --> 32:24.277
Who's first?

32:24.319 --> 32:25.737
-Go, Terez, go!
-All right.

32:25.779 --> 32:27.489
Ah!

32:39.626 --> 32:40.919
We have another vessel
in the marina

32:40.960 --> 32:42.504
that's quarantined
in the bubble,

32:42.545 --> 32:44.631
and I've asked for their
sous chef to come help.

32:44.673 --> 32:46.591
She's not a chef,
but she's a sous chef,

32:46.633 --> 32:48.843
so we're gonna figure
this out together.

32:48.885 --> 32:51.304
-Woo!
-Ah!

32:56.810 --> 32:57.811
[bleep]

32:57.852 --> 32:58.812
I might head up
to the hot tub.

32:58.853 --> 33:00.355
-Okay.
-Cool.

33:00.397 --> 33:02.273
All right, well, yeah,
enjoy the hot tub.

33:02.315 --> 33:05.485
<i>All crew, meet me in the crew</i>
<i>mess for a quick meeting.</i>

33:08.655 --> 33:11.408
I have a feeling Chef
is not coming back.

33:12.826 --> 33:16.621
So, we have a chef
that can help in the galley,

33:16.663 --> 33:19.165
but we need to make dinner.

33:23.003 --> 33:24.796
So, we could do
surf-and-turf, right?

33:24.838 --> 33:26.589
Someone could grab the oysters
and the lobster

33:26.631 --> 33:28.925
and bring them up to the galley,
we could start that.

33:28.967 --> 33:30.218
-Okay.
-...grab them.

33:30.260 --> 33:31.511
We'll look.

33:31.553 --> 33:32.679
You'll be in the galley
to start now?

33:32.721 --> 33:33.722
-Yep.
-Okay.

33:33.763 --> 33:35.807
Good job.

33:35.849 --> 33:37.308
We're ----ed.

33:37.350 --> 33:38.810
Okay, let's go
to the main salon,

33:38.852 --> 33:40.478
let's finish pulling
the rest of this.

33:40.520 --> 33:41.813
What do you want,
lobster and lamb?

33:41.855 --> 33:42.814
Did you say crabs?

33:42.856 --> 33:43.815
Oh, I don't want crabs.

33:43.857 --> 33:45.442
[laughing]

33:45.483 --> 33:46.860
We're gonna pack
that slide away.

33:48.528 --> 33:49.779
Yeah.

33:49.821 --> 33:52.282
Okay, let's pour
the oysters in here.

33:52.323 --> 33:53.533
Sweet.

33:55.994 --> 33:57.537
Oh, hello, boys.

33:57.579 --> 33:58.747
I'm not really a pro on lobster.

33:58.788 --> 34:00.457
Google it.

34:00.498 --> 34:01.624
Do you guys like a later dinner?

34:01.666 --> 34:03.501
We can do, like, 8:30.

34:03.543 --> 34:05.211
I'll tell you what,
we are not cooking.

34:05.253 --> 34:07.380
-Woohoo!
-We trust you guys.

34:07.422 --> 34:10.425
I've never eaten them like this.

34:10.467 --> 34:12.635
Oh!

34:12.677 --> 34:14.512
I'm not really,
like, a hunting type.

34:14.554 --> 34:16.848
Back home, I don't shoot
rabbits or nothing.

34:16.890 --> 34:18.391
There's no way I could do that.

34:18.433 --> 34:21.519
I should not be in here.
What am I doing in here?

34:21.561 --> 34:22.896
I can do them.

34:22.937 --> 34:26.816
How do you kindly
kill a lobster?

34:26.858 --> 34:27.859
Sh--.

34:27.901 --> 34:29.903
<i>Plunge a sharp knife...</i>

34:31.571 --> 34:33.656
Oh! Savage!

34:41.706 --> 34:42.082
Oh, savage.

34:43.833 --> 34:46.378
Seems like they're scrambling
without having a chef.

34:46.419 --> 34:47.587
Oh!

34:47.629 --> 34:48.797
Hi.

34:52.384 --> 34:54.302
-Okay.
-Yeah.

34:54.344 --> 34:56.012
Oh, that's probably the worst
I've ever felt about myself.

34:56.054 --> 34:57.430
Captain Sandy?

34:57.472 --> 34:58.431
Yeah, I'm here.

34:58.473 --> 34:59.557
Hello, Duska.

34:59.599 --> 35:00.600
Welcome, nice to meet you.

35:00.642 --> 35:02.394
Nice to meet you too, yes.

35:02.435 --> 35:05.939
So, we've got lobster,
the steaks, and the oysters.

35:05.980 --> 35:07.482
Lobsters...

35:08.817 --> 35:10.318
You know nothing?

35:12.445 --> 35:14.322
Oh, okay.

35:15.824 --> 35:17.951
-Okay.
-Okay.

35:17.992 --> 35:19.452
I put me heart and soul
into just murdering

35:19.494 --> 35:21.329
all these ----ing lobsters,

35:21.371 --> 35:24.624
and then the chef turns up
and she can't cook lobsters.

35:24.666 --> 35:26.042
The [bleep]?

35:35.927 --> 35:37.512
-Yes.
-Okay.

35:37.554 --> 35:39.806
All right, buddy, I'm sorry.

35:39.848 --> 35:42.684
Whew, are we loving charter?

35:42.726 --> 35:44.519
Ah! [bleep]

35:45.729 --> 35:47.063
Nice.

35:47.105 --> 35:48.732
So not fair.

35:51.568 --> 35:53.403
Coming down... good.

35:53.445 --> 35:54.446
Copy.

35:54.487 --> 35:55.697
I'm lined up.

36:01.453 --> 36:02.954
Oh, my God, was he alive?

36:02.996 --> 36:03.997
Yeah, they all are.

36:04.039 --> 36:05.081
Yeah, it's very fresh.

36:05.123 --> 36:06.791
They're fresh.

36:06.833 --> 36:08.376
Really?

36:08.418 --> 36:09.919
-We need way more stuff.
-That's pretty.

36:09.961 --> 36:11.921
Just... no, that is fine,
just like that.

36:11.963 --> 36:13.173
I know, but we need...

36:13.214 --> 36:14.174
We're gonna hang these, yeah.

36:14.215 --> 36:16.009
Who even likes neon?

36:16.051 --> 36:18.595
I come from working on
pretty high-end boats.

36:18.636 --> 36:21.681
Everything is meant to be
really, like, nice and elegant,

36:21.723 --> 36:24.726
and I don't do
tacky table décor.

36:24.768 --> 36:27.729
So, neon theme hurts
my soul a little bit.

36:28.730 --> 36:29.939
Ooh.

36:31.566 --> 36:33.902
Nice, all right,
that's good, thank you.

36:33.943 --> 36:35.570
Let's go get ready for dinner.

36:35.612 --> 36:37.197
Birthday party!

36:37.238 --> 36:39.074
Oh, my God, they're
popping open, I'm so happy.

36:39.115 --> 36:40.617
Are they aphrodisiac?

36:40.658 --> 36:41.910
Yes.

36:45.747 --> 36:47.540
Tacky, tacky, tacky.

36:47.582 --> 36:49.042
I think we should try
to cook one of those,

36:49.084 --> 36:50.460
to see how it tastes.

36:50.502 --> 36:52.170
Yeah.
This is not okay.

36:52.212 --> 36:54.881
I'm just in there doing
what I'm, like, I don't know...

36:54.923 --> 36:57.133
making ----ing sh-- I used
to make for the family

36:57.175 --> 36:58.718
that I used to nanny for.

36:58.760 --> 37:00.804
Onions and tomatoes together,

37:00.845 --> 37:01.888
like, pan-fried,
and then, like...

37:01.930 --> 37:04.849
Yeah, like salad.

37:04.891 --> 37:06.726
-Like a salad?
-In a salad.

37:06.768 --> 37:10.105
And then Duska's there,
like, no idea what's going on.

37:10.146 --> 37:12.065
Oh, I'm not doing
so well over here.

37:12.107 --> 37:14.651
[bleep] it's hot!

37:14.693 --> 37:16.611
Yeah, I could do a salad,
that's probably a better idea.

37:16.653 --> 37:18.738
Salad.

37:18.780 --> 37:21.574
I'm not having success
on the lobster.

37:21.616 --> 37:24.828
What's happening in the galley
right now is a disaster.

37:24.869 --> 37:27.038
Worst-case scenario,
we'll make 'em paninis.

37:27.080 --> 37:29.582
Well done today, guys.

37:29.624 --> 37:33.003
Lloyd, in that hat, you
look like Mario.

37:34.713 --> 37:36.923
[humming]

37:40.802 --> 37:42.679
It's me, Mario!

37:42.721 --> 37:44.639
No?

37:44.681 --> 37:48.727
So, you two in epaulettes,
you're adios.

37:48.768 --> 37:50.603
All right.

37:50.645 --> 37:52.522
I don't know what to do.

37:52.564 --> 37:54.274
Okay, just to go over exactly
what we're having tonight,

37:54.315 --> 37:55.859
so we've got lobster tails?

37:55.900 --> 37:56.943
Yeah...

37:56.985 --> 37:58.528
Maybe.

37:58.570 --> 38:00.196
Maybe, we don't really... yeah.

38:00.238 --> 38:02.699
Steak, roasted veg,
and oysters.

38:04.117 --> 38:06.703
Is the Captain really cooking?

38:06.745 --> 38:07.787
You manning the grill?

38:07.829 --> 38:09.122
Yeah, well, I'm gonna try it.

38:09.164 --> 38:10.790
You got no room for error.

38:10.832 --> 38:12.751
I literally haven't peed
in, like, five hours.

38:12.792 --> 38:14.127
Ugh.

38:17.213 --> 38:18.882
Sorry.

38:18.923 --> 38:21.509
Malia, can you just confirm
what my uniform will be?

38:29.309 --> 38:30.643
Let's do it.

38:30.685 --> 38:32.604
Let's go, let's go to dinner.

38:32.645 --> 38:34.689
Oh, your vegetables,
I think, are done.

38:34.731 --> 38:35.774
It's finished, yeah.

38:35.815 --> 38:37.776
I was just gonna serve this now.

38:37.817 --> 38:40.111
Yeah, there we go.

38:40.153 --> 38:42.822
Maybe some more of that,
more salt.

38:42.864 --> 38:46.284
All crew, we have all
guests up here for dinner.

38:46.326 --> 38:47.619
Duske?

38:47.660 --> 38:49.579
-Duska, yeah.
-Duska, sorry.

38:49.621 --> 38:51.081
Do you want some oil or no?

38:52.749 --> 38:54.834
Yeah, there needs to be
some oil in there, yeah?

38:54.876 --> 38:56.628
We got glowsticks.

38:56.670 --> 38:58.171
And we do need
a couple connectors.

38:58.213 --> 38:59.673
Cut that out.

38:59.714 --> 39:01.007
I feel like that's coming.

39:01.049 --> 39:02.092
Birthday shot for Jordan!

39:02.133 --> 39:03.134
Let's do shots.

39:03.176 --> 39:06.554
Happy birthday, Jordan!

39:06.596 --> 39:07.806
Happy birthday!

39:07.847 --> 39:09.057
Galley, galley,
we've done water.

39:09.099 --> 39:11.184
I'm just gonna go around
and do the wine,

39:11.226 --> 39:13.853
and then we're good
to start running food.

39:13.895 --> 39:15.355
Hello.

39:15.397 --> 39:17.941
It's first day of school.

39:17.982 --> 39:19.693
We are plating, ready to go.

39:19.734 --> 39:21.194
That looks good,
that looks good.

39:21.236 --> 39:24.072
-I know, I don't...
-Look at us!

39:24.114 --> 39:26.908
Okay, yeah, just the steaks
left, and then we're good.

39:27.951 --> 39:29.327
Yes.

39:29.369 --> 39:30.787
-Ooh!
-Whoa!

39:30.829 --> 39:32.956
Woohoo!

39:32.997 --> 39:34.082
Yeah, girl.

39:34.124 --> 39:35.917
Ooh, mushrooms.

39:35.959 --> 39:37.085
Nice.

39:37.127 --> 39:38.712
Ooh!

39:38.753 --> 39:39.921
Oh, yeah.

39:41.631 --> 39:43.717
I can't believe this
is being served right now.

39:43.758 --> 39:46.052
So, obviously we have
oysters, roast vegetables,

39:46.094 --> 39:47.762
salad, mushrooms.

39:47.804 --> 39:48.763
What is that?

39:48.805 --> 39:50.056
It's lobster, honey.

39:50.098 --> 39:51.766
That's what I'm talking about.

39:57.272 --> 39:58.606
Yeah.

39:58.648 --> 39:59.649
Sure.

40:05.280 --> 40:07.240
This is why chefs
are always so angry.

40:07.282 --> 40:08.658
Yeah.

40:08.700 --> 40:10.326
-What is that?
-I don't know.

40:10.368 --> 40:11.786
Poisonous, probably.

40:14.873 --> 40:15.915
Mm.

40:15.957 --> 40:17.125
Thank you so much.

40:17.167 --> 40:18.626
There's more coming.

40:20.378 --> 40:21.755
Yeah.

40:21.796 --> 40:22.881
Would you like one
or two pieces?

40:22.922 --> 40:24.257
Two, please.

40:27.719 --> 40:28.928
That sucks.

40:30.972 --> 40:32.265
You can do better.

40:32.307 --> 40:34.976
This is not yachting,
this is surviving.

40:36.353 --> 40:37.771
[loud belch]

40:37.812 --> 40:38.855
-Mm.
-Excuse me.

40:38.897 --> 40:40.148
Do y'all have water anywhere?

40:41.733 --> 40:42.734
Yeah.

40:49.449 --> 40:49.866
It's disgusting.

40:51.076 --> 40:53.078
-Ugh.
-That was ugh.

40:53.119 --> 40:54.704
That's so sh--.

40:54.746 --> 40:56.331
Why would you cook
the oysters, though?

40:56.373 --> 40:57.749
You don't cook them
unless they're Rockefeller,

40:57.791 --> 40:59.250
with parmesan and sh--
on top of them.

40:59.292 --> 41:02.962
-Wow, we need to do cabins.
-Okay.

41:03.004 --> 41:05.298
So, you grilled 'em without
anything on 'em [bleep]?

41:05.340 --> 41:06.841
How does that work?

41:06.883 --> 41:08.134
-You want some garnish, or no?
-Yeah.

41:08.176 --> 41:09.219
I don't know what you can use.

41:09.260 --> 41:10.804
Just throw some
sh-- on there.

41:10.845 --> 41:11.888
Can someone come and
help me do turndowns?

41:14.224 --> 41:16.142
Can you send some chips
and queso to my room?

41:19.145 --> 41:20.814
Hey, I tried, really did.

41:20.855 --> 41:22.107
Just, like, fold
two or three things,

41:22.148 --> 41:23.108
and then close the luggage.

41:23.149 --> 41:24.401
Okay.

41:24.442 --> 41:26.236
Why work so hard
when you could work easy?

41:27.779 --> 41:28.947
That was horrible.

41:30.365 --> 41:31.533
And it's not even fair.

41:31.574 --> 41:33.034
Nope...

41:33.076 --> 41:34.077
All the same color.

41:36.204 --> 41:37.414
Yeah, I know, we all agree.

41:37.455 --> 41:38.540
Horrible, dude. Dry.

41:38.581 --> 41:40.375
Some more steak.

41:40.417 --> 41:41.376
Nope, we're good.

41:41.418 --> 41:43.128
-No more.
-Okay.

41:43.169 --> 41:46.339
In terms of yachting, no,
this is not ----ing acceptable.

41:46.381 --> 41:49.342
In terms of the situation right
now, this is all we can offer.

41:51.011 --> 41:52.053
Really? You're getting sick?

41:52.095 --> 41:55.473
I appreciate you.
Yeah.

41:55.515 --> 41:57.392
I'm sorry you feel sick.

41:57.434 --> 41:59.227
What the [bleep]?

41:59.269 --> 42:00.437
Yeah, it was ----ing horrible.

42:00.478 --> 42:02.522
Everything was fail,
fail, fail.

42:02.564 --> 42:04.107
What the [bleep].

42:04.149 --> 42:05.400
You can call your boat now.

42:05.442 --> 42:07.110
-Ah, okay.
-I appreciate it.

42:07.152 --> 42:08.778
Okay.

42:08.820 --> 42:09.946
Really?

42:09.988 --> 42:13.408
[speaking foreign language]

42:13.450 --> 42:15.410
Tonight's dinner was
a complete sh-- show.

42:15.452 --> 42:18.079
I just pray the chef comes back.

42:18.121 --> 42:19.497
Bye!

42:19.539 --> 42:22.292
Bye, thank you.
Thank you so much for your help.

42:29.466 --> 42:30.800
I'll walk with you.

42:30.842 --> 42:31.843
-Dave?
-Yo?

42:31.885 --> 42:33.261
-Go down.
-Thank you.

42:33.303 --> 42:34.929
My laundry never came
back today.

42:34.971 --> 42:37.932
Here's my underwear
and bras, just chilling.

42:37.974 --> 42:40.185
-Okay, yeah?
-Okay. Yeah?

42:42.020 --> 42:43.146
Ah, living the dream.

42:43.188 --> 42:44.522
Here he comes.

42:45.565 --> 42:46.983
Yeah.

42:51.112 --> 42:52.864
Captain, Captain, Lexi.

42:52.906 --> 42:54.199
Thank you.

42:56.159 --> 42:57.452
Okay.

42:57.494 --> 42:59.329
Thank you!

42:59.371 --> 43:00.413
She's a nice lady.

43:02.916 --> 43:04.000
Did you hear Lexi on the radio?

43:04.042 --> 43:05.001
-What, she called me?
-Yeah.

43:05.043 --> 43:06.586
Go ahead, Lexi.

43:06.628 --> 43:11.466
<i>Hi, Captain, I believe</i>
<i>the primary is looking for you.</i>

43:11.508 --> 43:14.427
<i>Just a head's up,</i>
<i>she does not look too happy.</i>

43:18.515 --> 43:20.350
Do you want a hand
drying these?

43:20.392 --> 43:21.393
Yes, please.

43:21.434 --> 43:22.435
Oh.

43:26.606 --> 43:29.526
They're just not happy
with the food, which obviously,

43:29.567 --> 43:31.111
you don't have a chef
on your charter...

43:31.152 --> 43:32.529
-Yeah.
-Hi.

43:34.114 --> 43:36.533
Girl, you know this
is not okay.

43:36.574 --> 43:37.951
What?

43:40.954 --> 43:43.206
That was terrible.

43:43.248 --> 43:44.624
Yes, unacceptable.

43:48.086 --> 43:49.212
Grilled oysters, not okay.

43:53.925 --> 43:54.884
...party we asked for.

43:54.926 --> 43:56.052
Yeah.

43:56.094 --> 43:57.637
But today was not a good day.

43:57.679 --> 44:01.057
It's never easy to hear
criticism, but I failed them.

44:01.099 --> 44:02.308
I have failed them.

44:02.350 --> 44:04.102
-We're on a mega-yacht.
-Yeah.

44:04.144 --> 44:05.979
Sandy, we're not
on quarantine...

44:06.021 --> 44:07.188
-Yeah.
-We're on a mega-yacht.

44:07.230 --> 44:08.690
Again, it... sorry...

44:08.732 --> 44:12.027
We're on a mega-yacht,
it's bullsh--!
