00:16.725 --> 00:18.935
[Alexa] I knew my hair
was going to come out with chemo,

00:19.019 --> 00:20.562
but I just didn't know when.

00:20.645 --> 00:22.272
It's kind of like a surprise party,

00:22.355 --> 00:24.941
only with less gifts and more bald.

00:26.776 --> 00:28.278
OK, what now?

00:28.361 --> 00:29.571
You're asking me?

00:29.654 --> 00:31.531
Five minutes ago, I had hair.

00:31.614 --> 00:33.324
[chuckles] It was falling out in chunks,

00:33.408 --> 00:35.952
but I hadn't planned on
going Vin Diesel tonight.

00:36.870 --> 00:38.246
Whoa! Does your head feel weird?

00:38.329 --> 00:40.331
[mutters] So weird!

00:40.832 --> 00:42.959
We start school on Thursday,

00:43.042 --> 00:44.961
which would be fine if we were on Mars.

00:46.671 --> 00:48.131
Is everything all... [gasps]

00:48.214 --> 00:50.216
Holy mother of dragons!

00:51.342 --> 00:52.343
Wow.

00:53.845 --> 00:56.973
Honey, I didn't know your hair
started coming out. [sighs]

00:58.183 --> 00:59.184
OK.

00:59.851 --> 01:02.937
[breathless] Mom...
I might need to breathe.

01:04.856 --> 01:05.857
[Lori sighs]

01:06.191 --> 01:07.650
My beautiful girl.

01:09.069 --> 01:11.196
Thank God
you didn't get your father's head.

01:12.781 --> 01:14.032
I would have helped you.

01:14.115 --> 01:16.659
I didn't know that I was doing it
until I was doing it.

01:17.160 --> 01:19.079
Katie kind of got things started.

01:19.913 --> 01:21.122
Katie!

01:21.206 --> 01:22.207
[Lori gasps]

01:23.083 --> 01:26.753
Dave, can you believe
Katie did this for Alexa?

01:27.253 --> 01:29.339
Yeah, I-I like how it, uh...

01:30.465 --> 01:31.508
Wow.

01:32.926 --> 01:33.927
[Lori sighs]

01:34.010 --> 01:36.846
This is about the sweetest thing
I have ever seen.

01:39.432 --> 01:40.433
Katie?

01:41.476 --> 01:42.560
Yeah, I'm gonna go home.

01:44.354 --> 01:46.189
And I guess my hair's gonna stay here.

01:48.233 --> 01:51.820
Honey, don't let your head get cold, OK?
Or your neck, or your cute little ears.

01:51.903 --> 01:53.738
-I'm not cold.
-You may not be cold now--

01:53.822 --> 01:55.406
Mom, I'm good.

01:57.700 --> 01:58.868
Dad, are you OK?

01:59.661 --> 02:00.662
Wow.

02:02.038 --> 02:03.456
I think I broke Dad.

02:03.540 --> 02:05.416
Hm. No, he came that way.

02:06.960 --> 02:09.379
I still cannot believe
Katie did this with you.

02:09.879 --> 02:11.965
It's amazing. Does Jennifer know?

02:12.048 --> 02:13.800
[Jennifer screams]

Oh, sorry. The training for the 10k
Mom and I are doing starts today.

02:54.215 --> 02:57.176
You know, we signed up to run
to raise money for... you know...

-Leukemia?
-Yeah, already said you knew.

-Mom, stop babying me.

I'm the exact person I was yesterday.

03:08.479 --> 03:10.565
Well, so am I. Drink your milk.

03:11.900 --> 03:13.651
Dad, can you fix our shower drain?

03:13.735 --> 03:15.570
I stood in four inches
of water this morning.

03:15.653 --> 03:18.907
I had to do a rush job on my hair.
Can you tell I didn't use conditioner?

03:19.407 --> 03:21.075
[chuckles] Yeah, I didn't either.

03:21.576 --> 03:22.577
Can you tell?

03:23.494 --> 03:25.788
I'm sorry.
You know I think you're awesome, Lex.

03:27.206 --> 03:30.501
Oh, wow! Lex Luthor!
I'm totally calling you that!

03:31.419 --> 03:33.254
No, you're really not!

03:33.671 --> 03:36.174
-Classic Lex Luthor! Right, Dad?
-Hm?

03:36.799 --> 03:38.259
[laughs]

03:39.761 --> 03:41.221
Whoo! Yeah!

03:41.721 --> 03:42.847
Well, got to start my run.

03:44.474 --> 03:45.725
-Uh... Dave?
-Hm?

03:45.808 --> 03:47.018
-Eggs.
-Oh, yeah.

03:48.436 --> 03:50.438
Mm! Yum!

I am so proud of you.

You are so brave.

04:00.281 --> 04:01.407
Thanks.

04:01.491 --> 04:03.618
I'll look like a girl again someday,
won't I?

04:04.202 --> 04:05.453
Oh, honey!

04:05.536 --> 04:07.163
You look like a girl now.

04:07.872 --> 04:10.667
A beautiful, thoughtful,
amazing, wonderful girl.

04:10.750 --> 04:11.876
Thanks, Mom.

[sighs] Jack,
you've got to stop doing that.

04:20.301 --> 04:21.469
I can't get used to it.

04:21.552 --> 04:23.930
Well, now you know how I felt
when you were born.

04:24.847 --> 04:26.599
I like it better
when you have your hood on.

04:27.016 --> 04:29.602
-I like it better when you have pants on.
-Pants, Jack.

04:29.686 --> 04:30.728
Oh, man!

04:32.397 --> 04:35.275
Oh, Katie, I need you to take Jack
to the game store later.

04:35.358 --> 04:37.026
That video game Grandpa bought him is in.

04:37.110 --> 04:38.945
[Jack] Zombiegeddon!

04:40.613 --> 04:41.698
I'm OK!

04:43.032 --> 04:44.742
Mom, I can't go out like this.

04:44.826 --> 04:48.037
Look, I have to study for my night class,
and you still haven't been punished

04:48.121 --> 04:51.833
for taking your brother toilet-papering
in the night, so it's a win-win.

04:51.916 --> 04:54.836
-For who?
-For me. Wasn't I clear about that?

04:56.254 --> 04:57.964
You can't stay inside forever.

Oh, Lori. She wants me to come over

05:05.972 --> 05:08.891
so we can find cute things
for you girls to wear on your heads.

[cell phone chimes]

05:10.059 --> 05:12.854
Oh, Alexa. She wants to come over
because Lori's driving her crazy

05:12.937 --> 05:14.939
finding cute things
for us to wear on our heads.

05:17.984 --> 05:18.985
Not you.

05:20.320 --> 05:21.279
Not you.

05:23.114 --> 05:24.115
Not anyone.

05:24.657 --> 05:26.409
Well, we have to figure something out.

05:26.492 --> 05:29.996
We have 96 hours until we start school
and we don't have a plan.

05:30.913 --> 05:33.207
You know what? Let's make bald cool.

05:34.751 --> 05:35.585
Yeah.

05:36.210 --> 05:38.046
I don't care who sees us like this.

[cell phone ringing]

05:40.548 --> 05:43.342
-Ooh. Hannah and Reagan on FaceTime.
-No! We're bald!

05:46.554 --> 05:48.097
You want to go to the wig store?

05:48.181 --> 05:49.182
So bad.

05:50.224 --> 05:52.685
Is there a wig store
on the way to the wig store?

05:54.353 --> 05:56.939
Hey, Alexa,
did Katie tell you Zombiegeddon was in?

05:57.440 --> 05:58.816
[chuckles] Oh, sweetie.

05:58.900 --> 06:00.151
We don't talk about you.

06:03.071 --> 06:05.531
-You're bald because of your cancer?
-Jack!

06:05.615 --> 06:06.866
No, it's OK.

06:07.158 --> 06:08.451
Not because of the cancer,

06:08.534 --> 06:10.953
but because of the medicine
that kills the cancer.

06:11.037 --> 06:12.121
It also kills the hair.

06:12.914 --> 06:14.499
And you took that medicine?

06:14.582 --> 06:16.501
A lot of it. I still do.

06:16.584 --> 06:19.837
So being bald means you took your medicine

06:19.921 --> 06:22.215
and that means
your cancer's getting killed?

06:22.632 --> 06:23.466
Pretty much.

06:24.175 --> 06:25.551
That is awesome.

06:25.635 --> 06:26.844
[Alexa grunts]

06:26.928 --> 06:28.137

06:30.014 --> 06:31.349
See, that's why we keep him.

Lucas. Oh, my God!

06:36.687 --> 06:37.897
[Katie gasps]

06:40.525 --> 06:41.901
Mom was looking for you guys.

06:42.443 --> 06:44.028
-Where's Katie?
-In the closet.

06:45.113 --> 06:46.656
[Katie] Hey, Lucas.

Hey, Katie. What are you doing in there?

[grunts] Seven... eight...

06:52.954 --> 06:55.206
Well, I think it's really cool
what you did for Alexa.

06:58.292 --> 07:00.586
You know,
you could have shaved your head, too.

07:01.337 --> 07:02.338
Yeah.

07:02.421 --> 07:03.965
Yeah, I could totally do that.

07:04.799 --> 07:07.093
-But it's Katie's thing.
-Oh, Katie wouldn't mind.

07:07.176 --> 07:08.469
Cool, cool.

07:08.553 --> 07:10.054
But, I forgot to tell you,

07:10.138 --> 07:13.808
I'm signing up for that run thing
Mom and Dad are doing, because I care,

07:13.891 --> 07:17.061
and running is a beautiful way
of showing that you care.

07:17.145 --> 07:17.979
Bye.

07:22.483 --> 07:24.068
Oh, w-where's Lucas? [chuckles]

07:24.152 --> 07:25.153
Did I miss him?

07:27.405 --> 07:30.700
And the funny thing is
this is the healthiest Alexa's been

07:30.783 --> 07:32.326
since she's been diagnosed.

07:32.952 --> 07:37.165
And then her hair comes out and it's just
hard to remember she's doing well.

07:37.248 --> 07:38.458
Of course.

07:38.541 --> 07:41.043
That's why you and Dave
have been acting so weird.

07:41.711 --> 07:44.630
-You mean Dave?
-Right, I mean Dave.

07:46.841 --> 07:47.842
[Lori sighs]

07:47.925 --> 07:49.635
That wig would look so cute on Katie.

07:49.719 --> 07:52.346
Mm. Oh, that hat on Alexa.

07:55.266 --> 07:58.060
-Your daughter is so amazing.
-Your daughter is so brave.

08:02.773 --> 08:03.816
[Alexa sighs]

08:03.900 --> 08:07.695
Mom, you have a two-cries-a-week maximum.
Don't blow through them in one day.

08:07.778 --> 08:11.908
Oh. How are you feeling? OK? Yeah?
Are you hungry? Tired? Cold?

08:11.991 --> 08:16.078
Smothered? Mom, I'm gonna be fine.
Can you just drop us off at the mall?

08:16.162 --> 08:19.665
And then park and meet you inside? Sure.
Sounds like a plan. I'll go get my purse.

08:21.042 --> 08:23.753
Oh, Dad, can you drop us off instead?

08:24.295 --> 08:26.631
Yeah. Yeah, that sounds like bald. Fun!

08:28.799 --> 08:29.800
Uh...

08:30.718 --> 08:31.719
Uh...

08:32.220 --> 08:33.387
Time for a training run.

08:34.096 --> 08:35.223
OK.

08:36.140 --> 08:37.475
Weird.

08:37.934 --> 08:41.562
Mom, are you sure you have time?
You should probably get some training in.

08:41.646 --> 08:43.856
Oh, please!
I could do that 10k in my sleep.

08:44.232 --> 08:46.400
I've heard you breathing heavy
after vacuuming.

08:48.027 --> 08:49.278
We have thick carpet.

08:50.905 --> 08:54.450
Fine, OK? But if you get tired,
just go to the Nordstrom's bathroom.

08:54.534 --> 08:55.868
They have a very nice lounge.

08:56.369 --> 08:59.288
You can lie down. They don't like it,
but they don't stop you.

08:59.372 --> 09:00.373
[Lori chuckles]

09:03.626 --> 09:05.419
You can use the credit card
to get your wig.

09:05.920 --> 09:07.171
Just don't go over $100.

09:07.255 --> 09:09.423
-No, I-I won't. Thanks, Mom!
-[chuckles]

09:10.007 --> 09:11.634
If you go to the Nordstrom's bathroom--

09:11.717 --> 09:14.220
-Grab some of those fancy paper towels.
-That's my girl!

09:15.263 --> 09:16.722
Bring the big purse!

09:25.106 --> 09:27.733
OK, let's hurry.
We don't want to run into anyone we know.

09:28.234 --> 09:31.362
I don't think any of our friends
are shopping for back-to-school wigs.

"Are you guys ignoring us?" What do I say?

09:38.995 --> 09:41.581
-Make something up.
-I feel bad lying.

You're a good person, Katie.

Have to turn our phones off." Sent.

09:47.295 --> 09:49.380
Oh, great. More lies!

09:50.131 --> 09:52.967
Where am I going? Do I have a window seat?

09:53.050 --> 09:54.343
Is there a layover?

10:00.766 --> 10:02.768
[both laugh]

10:06.439 --> 10:08.024
If you girls are here to play,

10:08.107 --> 10:10.985
there's a ball pit at the Chuck E. Cheese.

10:12.236 --> 10:13.237
Sorry, ma'am.

10:13.738 --> 10:16.282
Getting to laugh is a rare treat for me.

10:16.365 --> 10:18.159
-[coughs]
-Oh.

10:19.285 --> 10:22.121
Oh, by all means, have fun!

10:22.204 --> 10:24.999
[chuckles] Enjoy! Laugh!

10:25.082 --> 10:26.000

10:26.083 --> 10:27.376
Laugh.

10:28.419 --> 10:29.420
[door closes]

10:30.004 --> 10:33.049
OK, we should probably look
for our real wigs.

10:33.883 --> 10:35.343
I like the one you have on.

10:35.426 --> 10:38.012
It says, "Bonjour, croissant."

10:39.430 --> 10:43.893
But this one says, "I'm bald, but wearing
a wig that looks like my real hair,

10:43.976 --> 10:45.811
so no one will ever know."

10:46.312 --> 10:47.313
Chatty wig.

10:49.565 --> 10:51.901
[mutters] Oh, $300?

10:52.443 --> 10:53.277
What?

10:53.611 --> 10:56.322
Uh... I just think we haven't
fully considered all our options.

10:56.405 --> 10:57.448
Oh, no!

10:57.948 --> 10:58.991
[Katie gasps]

10:59.075 --> 10:59.909
No!

11:00.951 --> 11:02.244
[mutters] $50.

11:03.120 --> 11:04.121
[groans]

11:05.873 --> 11:06.707
[sighs]

11:07.124 --> 11:08.542
[chuckles] Love these!

11:08.626 --> 11:10.586
Really? OK.

11:12.880 --> 11:13.881
[Alexa] Hm.

11:15.841 --> 11:16.842
Let's get both.

11:18.552 --> 11:19.637
No.

11:19.720 --> 11:21.389
No, let's just get the fun ones.

11:21.472 --> 11:23.516
That way we'll have fun all the time.

11:23.599 --> 11:25.810
[chuckles] Fun, fun, fun!

11:27.478 --> 11:29.814
Oh, no! Hannah and Reagan.

11:30.564 --> 11:31.399
Hide!

11:34.693 --> 11:35.694
Go, go, go.

11:40.282 --> 11:44.036
Hey, let's try on wigs...
and pretend we're Katy Perry.

11:44.537 --> 11:45.621
OK.

11:46.914 --> 11:50.084
-Last time I tried on wigs, I got lice.
-And we're done.

11:53.003 --> 11:54.213
-[sneezes]
-Bless you.

11:56.340 --> 11:57.591
[cell phone chimes]

11:57.675 --> 12:00.302
[scoffs] My mom's here. She's in a hurry.

12:00.386 --> 12:01.929
Oh, look at this bag!

12:02.513 --> 12:04.306
-[cell phone chimes]
-[alarm wails]

12:04.390 --> 12:07.893
-She says she's not waiting this time.
-Why did you teach her how to text?

12:11.397 --> 12:13.357
This is a misunderstanding, OK?

12:13.899 --> 12:19.113
I-I'm sorry, Officer. It's just sometimes
I get tired and just forget to do things.

12:19.613 --> 12:20.614
Oh!

12:21.198 --> 12:23.909
Poor thing! My niece has cancer.

12:25.619 --> 12:27.079
But she doesn't steal.

12:27.163 --> 12:30.416
Now, either you pay for these wigs,
or you're going to jail.

12:32.042 --> 12:34.044
Yeah. I love my job.

12:35.337 --> 12:36.338
[Lori sighs]

12:36.422 --> 12:39.175
I'm dying for them to get home.
I want to see what they got.

12:39.258 --> 12:42.344
I still can't believe what Katie did
for Alexa. That's a friend.

12:42.845 --> 12:44.138
Would you do that for me?

12:44.763 --> 12:47.224
I'm dying for them to get home.
I want to see what they got.

12:47.975 --> 12:49.059
Yeah, me neither.

12:49.727 --> 12:50.936
[doorbell rings]

12:51.020 --> 12:52.021
[Jack] Pizza!

12:52.104 --> 12:53.272
[footsteps on stairs]

12:57.443 --> 12:58.611
[Jack grunts]

12:59.111 --> 13:00.654
$19.95.

13:00.738 --> 13:02.990
Even the box smells good!

13:04.033 --> 13:05.784
-Sorry, declined.
-What?

13:05.868 --> 13:07.161
Your card, it was declined.

13:07.244 --> 13:08.746
[both] That's impossible.

13:09.788 --> 13:10.789
I just don't get it.

13:10.873 --> 13:12.541
[both] There's got to be some mistake.

13:14.376 --> 13:16.212
No! I already sniffed it!

13:16.295 --> 13:19.048
Yeah? I sniffed a Porsche once.
I didn't get that.

13:21.342 --> 13:22.885
Lori, let me. It's no big deal.

13:23.427 --> 13:24.762
Here you go.

13:24.845 --> 13:26.263
The five cents is for you.

13:26.347 --> 13:28.641
You can stick that nickel
somewhere special.

13:32.895 --> 13:36.065
For the tenth time,
I did not make a large purchase.

13:37.399 --> 13:39.235
[sighs] What are you, 20?

13:39.735 --> 13:43.405
You probably still make an allowance
and work on your weekends for "fun money"

13:43.489 --> 13:46.700
while getting all judgy on good,
hardworking people like me.

13:46.784 --> 13:50.287
Well, good luck making it in the real
world, missy, where life gets hard--

13:50.371 --> 13:51.539
I made the big purchase.

13:52.456 --> 13:54.792
Have a wonderful weekend.
Enjoy your twenties.

13:55.459 --> 13:57.002
I'm sorry, Mom.

13:57.503 --> 13:59.505
OK, the good wigs were so expensive.

13:59.880 --> 14:01.131
I didn't know what to do.

14:03.759 --> 14:06.887
Honey, I really admire
what you did for Alexa.

14:07.513 --> 14:09.348
You are an incredible friend.

14:10.140 --> 14:12.309
But we don't buy things we can't afford.

14:13.894 --> 14:14.895
I know.

14:15.479 --> 14:16.647
I'll take it back.

14:19.900 --> 14:22.403
Have them... put it on hold.

14:23.195 --> 14:25.239
We'll go back and get it next week
when I get paid.

14:25.322 --> 14:26.240
Really?

14:27.116 --> 14:28.492
Oh, thanks, Mom!

14:31.453 --> 14:33.956
So, I'll hold off
on going back to school until then?

14:34.456 --> 14:36.083
Nice try. You're going Thursday.

14:36.709 --> 14:38.335
Ooh! So smooth.

14:44.341 --> 14:46.343
[Lucas panting]

14:47.011 --> 14:51.265
Whoa! Dad, you ran through two red lights
and jumped a baby stroller.

14:52.808 --> 14:54.727
Really? Attaboy, Dave.

14:56.353 --> 14:58.355
[breathless panting]

15:04.862 --> 15:06.864
[panting continues]

15:09.074 --> 15:10.534
Do they have 1ks?

15:12.036 --> 15:13.037
[Lori groans]

15:13.746 --> 15:16.373
Oh, Alexa, that looks perfect!

15:16.457 --> 15:17.833
That wig looks great!

15:18.125 --> 15:19.752
See? Now your neck won't get cold.

15:19.835 --> 15:21.337
[Lori panting]

15:21.420 --> 15:22.755
[Lori groans]

15:22.838 --> 15:23.964
What's wrong, Mom?

15:24.048 --> 15:26.717
Oh, your father tried to kill me
on the training run.

15:27.217 --> 15:29.803
[groans] My blisters have blisters.

15:31.388 --> 15:33.015
Well, put your feet up,

15:33.098 --> 15:34.725
and lay back and take a nap.

15:34.808 --> 15:37.227
Oh, and don't get cold.
I'm gonna get you a blanket.

15:37.311 --> 15:39.063
Honey, I am not cold.

15:39.146 --> 15:40.314
OK. Uh...

15:41.607 --> 15:44.234
Have you had anything to eat?
How about vitamins? Supplements?

15:44.318 --> 15:45.611
Trail mix? PowerBar?

15:45.694 --> 15:48.822
Honey, I don't need anything.
You do not have to baby... [gasps]

15:49.406 --> 15:51.075
Oh!

15:52.076 --> 15:54.912
OK. I get it. I'm sorry.

15:54.995 --> 15:55.996
Thank you.

15:56.080 --> 15:58.082
But I'm not gonna change. I'm your mother.

15:58.165 --> 15:59.333
[sighs]

15:59.416 --> 16:00.417
[Dave] Hey!

16:00.793 --> 16:02.044
Look at you!

16:02.419 --> 16:03.963
[sighs] There's my girl.

16:05.798 --> 16:07.257
What is that supposed to mean?

16:09.343 --> 16:11.011
What? Alexa...

16:13.055 --> 16:14.056
Dave.

16:14.139 --> 16:15.140
What did I say?

16:15.474 --> 16:17.851
Dad, even I know why that was wrong.

16:19.812 --> 16:21.021
I think. Wait.

16:21.647 --> 16:22.648
Do I?

16:30.072 --> 16:31.073
Hey.

16:32.408 --> 16:33.534
Hey.

16:36.453 --> 16:39.039
Just thought I'd, uh...
hang out with my girl.

16:40.833 --> 16:42.042
In the bathroom.

16:43.752 --> 16:45.421
Surprised you even recognized me.

16:47.631 --> 16:48.716
I deserve that.

16:51.427 --> 16:53.053
I know I've been a little awkward.

16:53.929 --> 16:56.015
And, uh, I just wanted to say, uh...

16:58.058 --> 16:59.977
Wow, this tub is really backed up.

17:01.186 --> 17:02.896
Glad you got that off your chest.

17:02.980 --> 17:04.148
[water sloshing]

17:04.481 --> 17:07.234
Yeah, my hair was really starting
to come out before I shaved it.

17:10.070 --> 17:11.071
Honey...

17:12.281 --> 17:13.282
I'm sorry.

17:14.324 --> 17:15.743
I am not good at this.

17:16.493 --> 17:18.954
It's hard for me to even say the word...

17:21.206 --> 17:22.916
-Hairball.
-What?

17:23.000 --> 17:24.543
-In the drain.
-Oh!

17:25.252 --> 17:26.420
[Alexa groans]

17:27.046 --> 17:28.047
[both groan]

17:31.800 --> 17:32.926
I reacted badly.

17:34.344 --> 17:36.013
You've been doing so well,

17:36.096 --> 17:39.349
when I saw you like that,
it was impossible to forget you have--

17:39.433 --> 17:41.602
-Hairball.
-[chuckles] Exactly.

17:41.685 --> 17:43.479
-No, there's another one.
-Oh.

17:44.188 --> 17:45.481
-Wow!
-Oh!

17:45.564 --> 17:47.066
Some of that is Lucas's.

17:47.149 --> 17:48.776
[both chuckle]

17:53.113 --> 17:54.865
I think you look beautiful this way.

17:57.242 --> 17:58.660
Reminds me of the day you were born.

17:58.744 --> 17:59.745
[chuckles]

18:00.746 --> 18:02.206
The day I fell in love with you.

18:04.124 --> 18:05.375
Oh, Dad.

18:09.004 --> 18:10.005
I love you, sweetie.

18:12.299 --> 18:14.218
Wow, this one is pulling back.

18:14.301 --> 18:16.595
-Oh!
-[groans]

18:16.678 --> 18:17.888
Did we have a cat?

18:23.393 --> 18:24.561
I think your wig is cool.

18:25.437 --> 18:26.438
Thanks, Jack.

18:27.523 --> 18:28.774
I hate your shoes.

18:30.818 --> 18:31.819
[Alexa] Hey!

18:32.236 --> 18:33.237
Hi. Um...

18:34.029 --> 18:35.030
Thank you.

18:36.782 --> 18:38.117
I've been texting you.

18:38.992 --> 18:40.828
Wow, you really like that wig.

18:40.911 --> 18:42.454
Yeah. Yeah, it's fun.

18:42.538 --> 18:45.207
[chuckles] It's pink. Really, really pink.

18:46.917 --> 18:48.752
So why do you look like
you're about to cry?

18:48.836 --> 18:51.755
Because it's pink! Really, really pink!

18:52.965 --> 18:54.258
So just wear the other wig.

18:55.217 --> 18:58.554
I took it back. I can't afford a $300 wig.

18:59.221 --> 19:02.015
$300?

19:02.891 --> 19:04.852
Katie, you should have said something.

19:04.935 --> 19:08.313
You could buy a car for $300.

19:09.106 --> 19:11.692
I'm sorry.
I didn't even think about the cost.

19:12.568 --> 19:14.319
Hey, it's not just about the money.

19:15.904 --> 19:19.867
I made this big gesture so you wouldn't
be the only one without hair.

19:21.577 --> 19:25.747
But all I've been thinking about
since the second I did it is:

19:25.831 --> 19:28.083
how can I make it look like
I'm not bald?

19:28.959 --> 19:29.960
I know.

19:31.128 --> 19:33.922
That's who you are. You like to fit in.

19:34.715 --> 19:35.757
You're a blender.

19:36.341 --> 19:37.759
Yeah, I do like to blend.

19:39.011 --> 19:43.056
Which is exactly why it's so amazing
you did what you did.

19:45.684 --> 19:49.605
You could buy a shark for $300.

19:50.814 --> 19:52.191
I'm not brave like you.

19:52.649 --> 19:54.151
I'm not that brave.

19:54.234 --> 19:56.987
I'm the one who said to run
when we saw Hannah and Reagan.

19:57.446 --> 19:59.531
Yeah, that was very Katie of you.

20:01.200 --> 20:03.952
Look, when you shaved your head,

20:04.036 --> 20:06.914
you said I would never have
to go through anything alone.

20:07.623 --> 20:09.791
So you being scared of being bald

20:09.875 --> 20:11.960
means I don't have
to go through that alone.

20:12.586 --> 20:16.215
But if you don't tell me things,
then we're gonna go through it separately.

20:17.132 --> 20:18.467
And you cannot handle that.

20:20.052 --> 20:23.972
So when you're wearing your pink wig
to school on Thursday...

20:24.806 --> 20:26.141
I'll be wearing my blue one.

20:27.184 --> 20:28.018
Really?

20:28.101 --> 20:29.102
Yeah.

20:30.520 --> 20:32.189
-Weirdo.
-Freak.

20:32.272 --> 20:33.857
[both laugh]

20:35.150 --> 20:37.152
Guys! Guys!

20:37.653 --> 20:39.071
Guys, the line!

20:39.988 --> 20:41.114
OK, I'm going.

20:56.755 --> 20:59.967
[sighs] OK, so, I've been reading
everyone's Instagram, Facebook,

21:00.050 --> 21:02.135
Snapchat, and blog
since the first day of school,

21:02.219 --> 21:04.137
so we really haven't missed
that much gossip.

21:04.221 --> 21:05.681
What about schoolwork?

21:05.764 --> 21:07.391
Oh, we missed a lot of that.

21:08.600 --> 21:09.726
Alexa! Katie!

21:11.186 --> 21:13.355
What happened to your hair?

21:13.438 --> 21:14.731
Don't bother them, Hannah.

21:14.815 --> 21:17.025
Clearly they don't want
to hang out with us anymore.

21:17.109 --> 21:18.235
That's not true.

21:18.318 --> 21:21.154
You're doing your own thing:
wigs, teepeeing Trugly.

21:21.238 --> 21:22.656
Flying on planes.

21:23.657 --> 21:26.285
If you don't want to be our friends,
you could just say so.

21:26.368 --> 21:28.036
No, it's not that. I promise.

21:28.120 --> 21:29.705
There's just been a lot going on.

21:30.038 --> 21:32.916
[stammers] Things are complicated.
It's hard to explain.

21:33.000 --> 21:34.710
It's not that dramatic.

21:36.044 --> 21:37.170
I have cancer.

21:37.671 --> 21:38.672
[both] What?

21:38.755 --> 21:42.009
I'll explain everything to you later,
but for now,

21:42.092 --> 21:45.387
all you need to know is that I'm
kicking its butt and I'm gonna be fine.

21:45.470 --> 21:48.807
And I don't want anyone to know,
so please don't make a big deal out of it.

21:48.890 --> 21:50.183
[Alexa grunts]

21:51.852 --> 21:54.313
Huh. People get so huggy with cancer.

21:56.106 --> 21:57.774
As long as you're gonna be OK.

21:57.858 --> 21:59.484
We just missed you guys.

21:59.568 --> 22:00.652
[Hannah] Wait...

22:01.111 --> 22:03.405
And you caught it from her?

22:05.657 --> 22:09.411
No, I shaved my head in solidarity.

22:09.494 --> 22:11.621
[gasps] That's so beautiful!

22:12.414 --> 22:13.999
We don't have to do that, do we?

22:15.876 --> 22:19.671
No. Now, go. And if anyone asks
why you're crying, say it's allergies.

22:20.172 --> 22:22.966
Yeah, allergies are sad.

22:25.677 --> 22:27.679
[Alexa] So, there we were,
three days late,

22:27.763 --> 22:30.140
but finally starting high school.

22:30.223 --> 22:33.185
No matter how many times
we pictured this day over the years,

22:33.268 --> 22:35.479
we never would have pictured it like this.

22:36.897 --> 22:38.065
[sighs]

22:38.774 --> 22:39.775
Ready?
