01:42.747 --> 01:45.950
Don Pietro, I owe you my thanks

01:46.150 --> 01:47.952
for coming here.

01:55.359 --> 01:57.161
What's there to tell me?

01:58.129 --> 01:59.196
Guys...

02:07.304 --> 02:08.705
We've missed you.

02:12.409 --> 02:14.211
You thought you'd do fine without me,

02:14.378 --> 02:16.880
but now you see it's no good.

02:17.447 --> 02:19.416
Okay, I get it,

02:20.317 --> 02:22.118
let's cut the gab.

02:37.400 --> 02:39.402
My son's wife,

02:39.602 --> 02:41.804
that bitch,

02:41.971 --> 02:46.008
first tried to have
the alley kids kill my son

02:46.175 --> 02:48.577
then she went to the cops

02:49.879 --> 02:51.747
to report me

02:51.947 --> 02:54.950
for killing Mario, my driver.

02:55.150 --> 02:57.152
What do you want from me?

02:57.786 --> 03:00.389
Take your place back.

03:02.357 --> 03:05.761
We're in this mess
because of the Alliance.

03:06.795 --> 03:08.597
Because of the Alliance

03:09.197 --> 03:11.199
and because of that bastard...

03:13.301 --> 03:14.703
Ciro di Marzio.

03:14.903 --> 03:17.505
He's gotta drown in his own shit.

04:03.350 --> 04:04.551
Tell me.

04:04.784 --> 04:08.455
Malamore's phones dial loads
of numbers, they're all cloned.

04:09.389 --> 04:12.191
Those shits
keep changing phone cards!

04:13.192 --> 04:15.795
- And their cells?
- Those too.

04:16.428 --> 04:18.898
So, you don't have a fucking thing?

04:20.733 --> 04:23.035
Why the suspense? C'mon, talk!

04:23.502 --> 04:25.304
Three phones keep coming back.

04:25.504 --> 04:28.507
The cards change
but the phones are the same.

04:28.974 --> 04:31.177
But most important, the phones

04:31.377 --> 04:33.779
are always in the same place.

05:25.396 --> 05:26.997
It's me.

05:35.138 --> 05:38.141
So, you saw my son? What's he say?

05:38.975 --> 05:41.378
He knows everything.
He wants to know what you want to do.

05:42.946 --> 05:45.048
Exactly what I'm doing,

05:45.215 --> 05:48.818
getting rid of Ciro di Marzio
and his fucking Alliance.

05:49.152 --> 05:50.820
Instead, he gives wedding favors.

05:51.054 --> 05:53.656
He says Prince was his man
and you knew it.

05:53.856 --> 05:55.658
Prince was useful for my game.

05:55.858 --> 05:58.461
Tell him yourself,
he needs to see you.

05:58.661 --> 06:00.062
Sure,

06:00.263 --> 06:01.864
we're at his disposal.

06:02.064 --> 06:04.667
He knows everything,
even about Dwarf.

06:04.867 --> 06:07.470
So, I should be scared shitless?

06:09.605 --> 06:11.607
He's no fool.

06:13.642 --> 06:15.010
I never said he was.

06:15.210 --> 06:16.812
Yeah, but you think it.

06:17.012 --> 06:20.215
If I may,
you don't understand your son.

06:20.415 --> 06:22.217
He's just like you.

06:44.172 --> 06:45.073
Hello?

06:45.239 --> 06:48.242
It's me, auntie said okay.

06:49.911 --> 06:50.778
When?

06:50.978 --> 06:52.980
Tomorrow, at noon.

06:53.581 --> 06:55.549
First we meet,
then we go to auntie's.

06:57.017 --> 06:59.887
- Where?
- Where we said the other time.

07:01.021 --> 07:02.389
Okay.

07:40.359 --> 07:42.361
It's her, Patrizia.

07:43.729 --> 07:45.531
Go, Pitbull, follow her!

07:46.999 --> 07:49.401
How come no one realized it was her?

07:49.602 --> 07:51.604
Because she doesn't live here

07:51.804 --> 07:54.006
and has no contact with her uncle.

07:55.207 --> 07:57.209
That shit Malamore!

07:59.211 --> 08:01.213
No one knows her.

08:27.572 --> 08:28.573
Yeah?

08:46.724 --> 08:48.325
I understand.

08:50.828 --> 08:52.196
What's wrong?

08:53.397 --> 08:55.399
Scianel's switched sides.

09:08.967 --> 09:11.569
You gave her son
the Seven Buildings dealing spot.

09:11.769 --> 09:13.971
That ugly bitch killed our brother,

09:14.138 --> 09:15.573
now she's with Pietro, against us.

09:15.773 --> 09:18.175
We gave blood for you, now what?

09:18.342 --> 09:21.345
For once, I agree with him,
we gotta react.

09:22.546 --> 09:24.148
You're right,

09:24.348 --> 09:26.150
it's all my fault.

09:29.019 --> 09:31.021
But I got a gift...

09:31.889 --> 09:35.526
They opened my eyes to something
I hadn't seen before.

09:37.094 --> 09:39.696
I know who Pietro Savastano's
messenger is.

09:40.998 --> 09:42.799
It's a girl,

09:42.999 --> 09:45.001
Malamore's niece.

09:46.269 --> 09:49.472
She doesn't know it,
but now everything she says...

09:50.106 --> 09:51.908
I'll hear.

09:54.110 --> 09:55.912
You gotta stay calm.

09:56.112 --> 09:58.114
I'll tail her a little longer.

09:59.716 --> 10:02.518
Then we'll feed Pietro Savastano
to the dogs.

10:04.120 --> 10:06.122
Once he's gone,

10:06.322 --> 10:08.724
as for Scianel and her son...

10:09.125 --> 10:11.294
we don't give a fuck.

10:56.704 --> 10:58.506
You're working at the shop?

11:00.308 --> 11:04.311
If so, why's a car waiting
and you're so elegant?

11:06.747 --> 11:08.949
Zip me up, please.

11:11.552 --> 11:13.554
You used to tell me everything,
Patrizia.

11:17.991 --> 11:21.461
I used to work 15 hours a day,
and had no money for bills.

11:22.929 --> 11:24.731
Now I have more time for you,

11:24.965 --> 11:27.534
I bought you a motorbike
and your own TV.

11:28.535 --> 11:30.937
It's the price to pay
to change this shit life.

11:33.840 --> 11:35.408
I gotta go.

11:38.344 --> 11:42.148
Sometimes it seems
you like to pay this price.

13:16.940 --> 13:18.341
See that exit?

13:18.541 --> 13:19.943
Yeah.

13:20.543 --> 13:21.944
Take it.

13:50.572 --> 13:52.774
Now we go get Genny.

13:52.974 --> 13:54.376
Okay.

14:54.968 --> 14:56.769
What's the matter?

14:58.371 --> 15:00.173
Take the first turn.

15:01.708 --> 15:03.743
I don't see anyone.

15:27.966 --> 15:30.569
I was right, they're following us.

15:31.370 --> 15:33.372
- That car?
- Yeah.

15:35.574 --> 15:37.375
Now do what I say.

15:37.576 --> 15:40.145
Take the first turn you see, fast!

16:05.903 --> 16:07.771
Drive into that restaurant.

16:16.446 --> 16:18.248
Give me the phone.

16:18.982 --> 16:20.784
Wait here.

17:19.007 --> 17:22.010
They're in a parking lot
with another two cars.

17:22.544 --> 17:25.547
I don't know who they are,
I didn't see anyone.

17:25.747 --> 17:27.815
Who are we waiting for,
the Holy Virgin?

17:28.049 --> 17:30.918
That's the summit,
we gotta go in and kill 'em all.

17:32.787 --> 17:34.989
If Pietro's not there,
we've screwed it.

17:35.189 --> 17:37.592
We won't get
another chance like this.

17:38.426 --> 17:40.528
Get back there, go see.

17:40.728 --> 17:41.395
Okay.

17:51.538 --> 17:54.441
- It's me.
- Where the fuck are you?

17:54.641 --> 17:56.343
I've been waiting two hours for you.

17:57.411 --> 17:58.979
Sorry, I can't come.

18:00.113 --> 18:02.716
Another of auntie's messes?

18:04.017 --> 18:06.386
No, I don't feel good,

18:06.586 --> 18:08.788
I wanted to call earlier,
but I had no credit.

18:09.289 --> 18:12.659
<i>Luckily this restaurant
let me use the phone.</i>

18:13.193 --> 18:15.995
Call me,
so I don't spend their money.

18:16.196 --> 18:17.797
Ok, but...

19:09.147 --> 19:11.849
- Hello?
- What's this farce?

19:12.050 --> 19:15.520
They know I'm the messenger,
I'm being followed.

19:17.588 --> 19:19.790
- You're sure?
- Yes.

19:19.991 --> 19:21.392
I've always been careful,

19:21.592 --> 19:23.594
but they must have listened
to the calls,

19:23.794 --> 19:26.197
or they'd never have known
about today.

19:26.597 --> 19:27.998
Where are you?

19:28.199 --> 19:30.200
It doesn't matter,

19:30.401 --> 19:33.003
what counts is
that you see your father.

19:33.203 --> 19:35.606
Is this number secure?

19:35.839 --> 19:38.508
I'm in an isolated bar, don't worry.

19:39.209 --> 19:43.013
There's a boarding house, Fusco,
in Marina di Minturno, hurry.

19:43.180 --> 19:44.981
Your father's waiting.

19:45.215 --> 19:48.652
Tell him not to return
to his hideout, no old place is safe.

19:50.787 --> 19:51.988
What'll you do?

19:52.789 --> 19:54.791
I'll do what I have to.

20:01.464 --> 20:02.865
Thank you.

20:03.066 --> 20:04.667
For your trouble.

20:07.737 --> 20:09.171
Goodbye.

20:13.609 --> 20:15.778
Now it's just you and me.

20:32.728 --> 20:34.129
She came out.

20:34.796 --> 20:37.799
Go in and see if Pietro's there.

20:40.535 --> 20:41.936
Pitbull...

20:45.807 --> 20:47.976
- Follow Patrizia.
- Okay.

20:54.182 --> 20:55.783
Go that way.

20:55.983 --> 20:58.986
- Piece of shit, where is he?
- The girl left.

20:59.186 --> 21:01.622
- And those other shits?
- I don't know, I swear!

21:01.822 --> 21:04.225
- She was alone here.
- What did she do?

21:04.425 --> 21:07.828
Nothing, she asked to use the phone
and I let her.

21:08.028 --> 21:11.432
- I'll shoot your brains out, shit!
- I swear, just a phone call!

21:11.632 --> 21:14.835
- You're sure?
- I swear, just a phone call!

21:15.035 --> 21:18.005
- I found this in the toilet.
- No one's upstairs.

21:19.206 --> 21:21.441
Keep an eye on this shit.

21:27.581 --> 21:28.582
Ciro...

21:39.626 --> 21:41.227
Take me to him.

21:41.427 --> 21:42.829
Fast!

21:51.604 --> 21:53.406
You can open.

21:55.407 --> 21:56.809
Outta my way!

21:58.811 --> 22:01.413
We have to go, Ciro knows everything.

22:01.613 --> 22:04.817
Your hideout is screwed,
you can't use the phone. C'mon!

22:06.418 --> 22:08.020
Gennaro!

22:08.220 --> 22:09.688
What is it?

22:10.422 --> 22:12.224
Where's Patrizia?

22:15.861 --> 22:17.662
Are you serious?

22:18.997 --> 22:20.599
She's where she should be.

22:21.032 --> 22:22.434
Gennaro!

22:22.667 --> 22:24.469
Where's Patrizia?

22:29.841 --> 22:31.643
I don't know.

22:32.310 --> 22:37.014
She realized they were tailing her
and I came to save you. Move it!

22:42.253 --> 22:44.455
She's buying me time.

23:08.078 --> 23:10.080
That piece of shit!

23:33.335 --> 23:34.403
Eyes open!

23:54.489 --> 23:55.957
Watch out!

24:07.068 --> 24:09.437
Get out, you piece of shit!

24:09.637 --> 24:12.040
I'll shoot your brains out, get out!

24:13.041 --> 24:14.042
Get out!

24:14.242 --> 24:16.244
Go blow somebody, asshole!

24:17.278 --> 24:19.480
You made fools of us, right,
Patrizietta?

24:19.680 --> 24:21.382
Patrizietta is just for who knows me.

24:22.616 --> 24:24.485
I know you better than you think.

24:24.685 --> 24:26.086
Get in!

25:02.793 --> 25:03.761
Patrizia!

25:04.795 --> 25:06.597
Patrizia, help me!

25:07.131 --> 25:08.732
I didn't do a thing!

25:08.932 --> 25:11.135
He's just a kid,
he didn't do anything!

25:11.335 --> 25:13.537
You won't save your brother
with this bullshit!

25:13.737 --> 25:16.139
Touch him and I'll kill you!

25:16.340 --> 25:17.941
It's up to you.

25:23.380 --> 25:25.582
Help me, please.

25:25.782 --> 25:28.184
You suck, you're worth nothin'!

25:31.588 --> 25:34.190
Where's that shit master of yours?

25:34.691 --> 25:37.960
- That's all I want.
- Tell him what he wants, please.

25:41.731 --> 25:44.734
Patrizia, why don't you talk?

25:45.368 --> 25:46.969
Do something!

25:47.169 --> 25:49.372
Please, help me!

25:49.772 --> 25:51.173
Get me off of here!

25:51.373 --> 25:53.175
You're a shit!

25:53.375 --> 25:55.678
You're a shit! Leave him alone!

25:55.911 --> 25:57.513
Do something!

25:58.380 --> 26:00.182
Do something!

26:02.084 --> 26:04.086
- Help me...
- Alessio!

26:04.786 --> 26:06.788
Turn the water on!

26:14.563 --> 26:16.197
Alessio!

26:16.798 --> 26:18.066
Leave him alone!

26:18.266 --> 26:20.268
Do something, Patrizia!

26:20.468 --> 26:22.837
- Do something, please...
- Leave him alone!

26:23.104 --> 26:25.573
Do something...

26:28.176 --> 26:30.378
Where the fuck is Pietro Savastano?

26:40.588 --> 26:43.791
I'll tell you everything!
Pull him up!

26:43.958 --> 26:45.759
Turn the water off!

27:08.815 --> 27:10.483
I'll tell you everything.

28:31.862 --> 28:33.497
I see.

28:54.784 --> 28:56.786
Your master wasn't there.

28:57.954 --> 28:59.555
You warned him.

28:59.789 --> 29:01.390
I don't know how,
but you warned him.

29:01.591 --> 29:04.994
You bullshitted him,
now he'll kill us!

29:05.761 --> 29:08.631
I'm the messenger,
I'm the one you have to kill.

29:11.000 --> 29:14.003
You're right,
that's what I have to do.

29:15.271 --> 29:18.273
That's what killers, soldiers do,
people like us.

29:19.808 --> 29:21.810
Take them outside.

29:41.196 --> 29:42.997
The dead are piling up.

29:45.800 --> 29:48.803
All the dead I left behind me...

29:50.204 --> 29:52.206
come lookin' for me at night,

29:53.274 --> 29:55.476
they scream, I've got no peace.

29:59.413 --> 30:01.582
That's why I can't kill anymore.

30:06.787 --> 30:09.390
That's the difference
between him and me.

30:48.394 --> 30:50.796
I have a message for Little Bird.

31:26.598 --> 31:30.601
Malamore, what's Don Pietro want?
Why are you here?

31:33.004 --> 31:34.805
I've got an exchange to propose.

31:35.006 --> 31:38.409
We've got nothing to exchange,
get out.

31:38.876 --> 31:40.878
You're sure?

31:41.879 --> 31:44.882
So, Scianel's dealing spot sucks?

31:49.219 --> 31:52.289
But you have to tell me
where Ciro is, now.

31:59.996 --> 32:02.799
They're at Ittica Literno,
the fish plant.

32:05.201 --> 32:06.803
See?

32:07.003 --> 32:10.006
Your buddies jumped
at my proposition.

32:12.809 --> 32:14.577
When you killed Prince and Dwarf,

32:14.811 --> 32:16.613
you went against me in a second.

32:16.813 --> 32:18.381
You did the same thing.

32:18.614 --> 32:20.450
It's normal, isn't it?

32:20.683 --> 32:22.752
Secondigliano's all that counts.

32:23.619 --> 32:25.821
I couldn't trust Scianel

32:26.222 --> 32:28.424
and I got rid of her.

32:31.894 --> 32:34.296
I took the alley kids back.

32:35.231 --> 32:37.299
What are we, you and me?

32:37.499 --> 32:39.702
We're father and son.

32:40.836 --> 32:43.639
A son who tried
to screw his father...

32:44.339 --> 32:46.141
and a father who screwed his son.

32:47.242 --> 32:50.112
We met because
you wanted to understand.

32:50.312 --> 32:52.180
There's nothing to understand.

32:53.014 --> 32:55.016
Secondigliano's mine

32:55.417 --> 32:57.719
and no one else's.

34:02.215 --> 34:04.016
Where the fuck is she?

34:06.452 --> 34:08.054
The car!

34:08.853 --> 34:10.856
Get that bitch!

34:54.465 --> 34:56.067
Turn the engine off.

34:56.934 --> 34:59.136
License and registration, please.

35:00.438 --> 35:01.906
Your ID too.

35:15.018 --> 35:17.220
Naples 24 here, document check.

35:17.421 --> 35:19.289
<i>Go ahead, Naples 24.</i>

35:19.523 --> 35:20.991
Arzano Giuditta, born in...

35:32.702 --> 35:36.372
Suspicious likeness to wanted person
Annalisa Magliocca.

35:45.248 --> 35:47.650
<i>The documents are false, intervene.</i>

35:47.850 --> 35:49.652
Send back-up.

35:52.288 --> 35:53.289
Don't move!

35:53.489 --> 35:55.691
Don't move or they'll shoot us.

36:33.932 --> 36:36.335
Malamore, no one's here.

36:40.172 --> 36:41.773
They're here.

36:49.547 --> 36:50.949
Hurry!

36:57.188 --> 36:58.790
Where's Ciro?

36:58.990 --> 37:00.792
He left.

37:02.460 --> 37:04.262
Let's go, c'mon!

37:39.696 --> 37:41.698
- Hi, Lelluccio.
- Ciro!

37:42.398 --> 37:43.766
Come on.

37:51.174 --> 37:53.376
I called Lelluccio.

37:55.177 --> 37:58.314
I called him because he knows,
in first person,

37:58.981 --> 38:01.984
what it means
to trust Savastano again.

38:03.586 --> 38:05.588
There are no allies,

38:05.788 --> 38:09.391
no one's word counts,
not even his son counts, right?

38:09.591 --> 38:11.060
Until yesterday

38:11.260 --> 38:14.263
Savastano made war
with the alley kids.

38:14.796 --> 38:17.366
Today those bastards
sold my mother out.

38:17.566 --> 38:20.369
And tomorrow
they'll be excess baggage too.

38:21.770 --> 38:24.372
One thing's important for Savastano:

38:25.574 --> 38:27.175
himself.

38:30.345 --> 38:31.946
He wants to rule alone.

39:44.583 --> 39:46.585
You look worn out.

39:48.153 --> 39:49.755
So do you.

39:51.256 --> 39:53.292
Why did he leave?

39:54.226 --> 39:56.028
Was he afraid?

39:59.231 --> 40:01.633
He said he's tired of killing.

40:06.204 --> 40:09.607
If I may ask...
did you talk to Genny?

40:27.858 --> 40:30.728
- I did.
- What did you say?

40:30.928 --> 40:34.532
He has to step aside,
I'll handle things.

40:38.569 --> 40:40.371
What is it, Patrizia?

40:41.772 --> 40:43.774
Aren't you tired?

40:45.008 --> 40:48.011
- I could have not come back today.
- But you're here.

41:09.599 --> 41:11.601
I'm tired, Patrizia,

41:12.135 --> 41:13.736
but I can't stop.
