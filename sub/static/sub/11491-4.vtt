WEBVTT

00:01.130 --> 00:03.700
Call now. Operators are standing by.

00:05.030 --> 00:07.380
- What are you doing?
- I'm calling them.

00:07.390 --> 00:10.410
Don't you want to be able to scramble
an egg while it's still in the shell?

00:14.170 --> 00:18.580
Okay... new rule-- you can't drink
while we watch cable television.

00:19.360 --> 00:23.540
You won't say that when you get a
blanket with sleeves for Christmas.

00:28.840 --> 00:30.730
Hi, Jake.

00:33.200 --> 00:35.420
Can I offer you some fruit and cheese?

00:35.450 --> 00:38.660
- You can, but I won't eat it.
- Okay.

00:39.700 --> 00:42.300
So what's new? How's your girlfriend?

00:42.310 --> 00:44.690
That's kind of personal, isn't it?

00:44.990 --> 00:47.420
Sorry. I'm just curious.

00:47.430 --> 00:50.100
Why, you writing a book?

00:50.690 --> 00:54.580
Yeah, it's called The Day
Jake's Uncle Kicked His Ass.

00:55.040 --> 00:57.010
Whatever.

00:57.020 --> 01:00.490
Oh, no, don't go. We
so enjoy your company.

01:02.640 --> 01:04.319
Did I do something wrong?

01:04.349 --> 01:08.460
- Yeah, you anthropomorphized him.
- What?

01:08.880 --> 01:12.320
It means treating something
that's not human as if it is.

01:13.030 --> 01:15.030
You know, like you do with your cat.

01:15.060 --> 01:17.400
Which frankly, makes more sense.

01:17.840 --> 01:21.130
- I'm starting to think Jake resents me.
- See? You're still doing it.

01:21.640 --> 01:24.910
Look, you can't take it
personal. He's a teenager.

01:24.920 --> 01:29.020
You know, that awkward stage between
junior high and methadone clinic.

01:30.170 --> 01:32.030
I just want to get to know him better.

01:32.050 --> 01:34.930
I already know him. Trust
me, you're not missing anything.

01:34.940 --> 01:38.710
Come on, there's got to be something
underneath that sullen exterior.

01:38.720 --> 01:42.740
Yeah, a "D" student
with a perpetual boner.

01:46.400 --> 01:49.100
Ginzu knives.

01:52.720 --> 01:54.300
Kind of like high school, huh?

01:54.330 --> 01:57.960
- I never did this in high school.
- Really? Sex in a car?

01:57.970 --> 01:59.920
You're kind of built for it.

02:03.440 --> 02:04.950
Oh, what the heck is this?

02:04.980 --> 02:08.789
Oh, Jake's retainer.
He lost this years ago.

02:08.800 --> 02:12.910
This cost me like,$500. Anyway...

02:13.450 --> 02:15.970
No, this is not working for me.

02:15.990 --> 02:18.700
- Want another wine cooler?
- No, I want to be in a real bed.

02:18.710 --> 02:20.970
Well, what do you want me to
do? You won't stay at Charlie's.

02:20.980 --> 02:24.360
How can I go back there after
his fiancee called me a tramp?

02:24.390 --> 02:25.790
Oh, come on, she didn't mean it.

02:25.800 --> 02:28.850
That was just heat of the moment when
she found out you'd slept with Charlie.

02:28.860 --> 02:30.650
It doesn't bother you, does it?

02:30.670 --> 02:34.330
Well, yeah, yeah, a bit, you know,
but beggars can't be choosers.

02:35.230 --> 02:38.150
And I love you.

02:39.400 --> 02:41.500
No, not here.

02:41.510 --> 02:44.760
Well, then where?I'd be more than
happy to go back to your place

02:44.770 --> 02:47.610
if you could just get past that
little incident with your mother.

02:47.640 --> 02:50.670
Little incident? I caught
you in bed with her!

02:50.680 --> 02:53.910
Boy, you are just going to keep
harping on that, aren't you?

02:54.370 --> 02:56.550
Why don't we just got to a hotel?

02:56.580 --> 02:59.350
Uh, well, we could, but wouldn't
that feel kind of cheap?

02:59.360 --> 03:01.750
I'll tell you what feels
kind of cheap-- you.

03:01.760 --> 03:03.650
- What are you doing?
- I'm getting out of here.

03:03.660 --> 03:05.280
What-what, you're gonna walk home?

03:05.310 --> 03:08.820
Well, it's not far, Alan. You didn't
want to waste the gas, remember?

03:09.790 --> 03:12.210
- Pardon me for being
green. - Good-bye.

03:12.220 --> 03:14.990
Oh, come on, Melissa! Let's
not ruin a beautiful evening!

03:15.000 --> 03:17.930
I already broke the seal on the condom!

03:18.470 --> 03:22.070
All right, all right. All
right, you win, you win.

03:22.080 --> 03:24.860
I'll take you to a cheap motel.

03:29.300 --> 03:30.390
Oh, great.

03:30.410 --> 03:33.210
Stand up and put your
hands behind your head.

03:34.270 --> 03:37.260
- Uh, I can explain this.
- Hands behind your head!

03:39.180 --> 03:41.040
This is not what it looks like.

03:41.070 --> 03:44.700
I-I-I was just chasing this
girl who jumped out of my car.

04:27.590 --> 04:29.980
- You got a minute?
- I'm practicing.

04:30.670 --> 04:33.140
Yeah, well, take a pause for the cause.

04:33.150 --> 04:36.260
- What?
- Take five.

04:36.270 --> 04:38.340
Five what?

04:39.070 --> 04:41.430
Just shut up and listen to me!

04:43.160 --> 04:45.340
- You have a problem with Chelsea?
- No.

04:45.350 --> 04:47.790
- So what's with the attitude?
- What attitude?

04:47.800 --> 04:51.160
I just don't consider fruit
and cheese an acceptable snack.

04:51.450 --> 04:53.030
I don't care. You were rude.

04:53.040 --> 04:56.330
- Kettle corn-- that's a
snack. - That's not the point.

04:56.340 --> 04:58.740
Nachos-- that's a
proper use of cheese.

04:59.190 --> 05:01.210
All right, all right, listen to me.

05:01.240 --> 05:04.590
You're hurting Chelsea's feelings and I need
you to make an effort to be nicer to her.

05:04.600 --> 05:07.620
Hey, it's not my problem if
your girlfriend's oversensitive.

05:08.000 --> 05:10.330
Yeah, it kind of is.

05:10.360 --> 05:13.280
If you guys can't get along,
then one of you has got to go.

05:13.300 --> 05:16.510
- And guess who that's going to be?
- Why? Just 'cause you sleep with her?

05:16.520 --> 05:19.390
Good for you. Why do
people think you're stupid?

05:20.650 --> 05:23.980
'Cause of my grades.
Actually,I'm an underachiever.

05:27.670 --> 05:29.480
Just be nice to Chelsea, all right?

05:29.490 --> 05:31.910
Fine.

05:44.300 --> 05:46.980
Well, that was uncalled for.

05:48.830 --> 05:51.130
Just F.Y.I.,your son's a moron.

05:51.980 --> 05:55.270
- No, he's an underachiever.
- Where have you been?

05:55.280 --> 05:57.160
- Had a date with Melissa.
- How'd it go?

05:57.170 --> 06:00.290
She broke up with me and I may
have to register as a sex offender.

06:02.130 --> 06:04.200
Well, as long as you had fun.

06:04.210 --> 06:06.950
Charlie, do you have any idea how
difficult it is to maintain a relationship

06:06.960 --> 06:08.700
when you don't have a place of your own?

06:08.720 --> 06:11.210
Alan, if I didn't have a place of my own,

06:11.260 --> 06:13.940
I'd be worried about more important
things than a relationship.

06:13.950 --> 06:16.970
Like, you know, getting
a place of my own.

06:17.650 --> 06:20.360
So, you're saying I'm not
entitled to a relationship?

06:21.470 --> 06:26.840
No,I'm saying if you can't afford
dog food you don't get a dog.

06:27.560 --> 06:30.010
Oh, great, so I'm just supposed to
be alone for the rest of my life?

06:30.040 --> 06:33.470
No, you're supposed to get
your own freakin' place!

06:35.670 --> 06:38.940
Just 'cause you keep saying it,
doesn't mean it's gonna happen.

06:43.630 --> 06:45.400
How's the French toast, Jake?

06:45.410 --> 06:48.540
It's bread dipped in eggs.
You can't really screw it up.

06:50.980 --> 06:52.960
It's fine.

06:54.530 --> 06:58.040
It's the best damn French toast I've
ever had in my whole freakin' life.

06:58.870 --> 07:01.810
Now stop kicking me.

07:01.820 --> 07:03.310
Okay, guys, I'll see you later.

07:03.320 --> 07:06.280
- Oh, you're working on a Sunday?
- Well, kind of.

07:06.290 --> 07:10.530
Since my brother and I are both extremely
anxious for me to get my own place--

07:10.540 --> 07:15.140
me, because I'd like a sense of autonomy,
and him, because he's a spiteful turd--

07:16.730 --> 07:19.070
I have found a way to
earn some extra money.

07:19.080 --> 07:24.060
Great. Put me down for three boxes of
Thin Mints and some Peanut Butter Sandies.

07:25.290 --> 07:28.530
Ah, Girl Scout cookies?
I like those Samoas.

07:29.000 --> 07:30.840
I'm not selling cookies, Jake.

07:32.320 --> 07:35.880
Then what are you selling? It better
not be your liver-- I got dibs.

07:36.670 --> 07:40.240
Hello. Where is my new assistant?

07:40.740 --> 07:42.790
Oh, you didn't.

07:42.810 --> 07:44.640
Morning, all. Here, darling, put this on.

07:44.650 --> 07:46.370
Ooh, snazzy. Do I get to keep it?

07:46.380 --> 07:49.510
No, but if this works out,
I'll sell it to you at cost.

07:51.320 --> 07:53.900
- You're going to work for Mom?
- What else am I supposed to do?

07:53.910 --> 07:57.140
I don't know, some job that
lets you keep your self-respect.

07:57.150 --> 07:59.970
Like, you know, man whore...

08:00.780 --> 08:03.720
Dog de-wormer...

08:03.750 --> 08:05.720
Outhouse inspector.

08:05.740 --> 08:07.140
- Morning, Charlie.
- Hey, Mom. How are you?

08:07.150 --> 08:09.670
Laxative tester, horse inseminator.

08:10.820 --> 08:12.780
I'm going to work weekends
with Mom selling real estate,

08:12.810 --> 08:14.220
and she's going to give
me a piece of the action.

08:14.250 --> 08:20.320
No, I said having an assistant would give me
a little peace so I could get some action.

08:25.530 --> 08:28.070
Well, whatever. It's a start. Let's go.

08:28.080 --> 08:30.750
No, dear.I say,"Let's go""

08:31.000 --> 08:33.400
- Oh, oh, okay.
- Let's go.

08:33.720 --> 08:37.900
Stop. Take my bag. Now let's go.

08:40.130 --> 08:42.659
This is going to be fun.

08:43.820 --> 08:46.550
Okay,I'm done.

08:48.070 --> 08:50.060
He didn't say thank you.

08:50.090 --> 08:53.030
He's leaving the room.
We should thank him.

08:56.000 --> 09:00.210
Jake, come back in here and
say thank you to Chelsea.

09:04.600 --> 09:07.340
Jake,I'm warning you.

09:08.940 --> 09:11.530
Jake!

09:14.730 --> 09:17.340
Thank you, Chelsea.

09:21.850 --> 09:25.040
Now was that so hard?

09:28.170 --> 09:31.300
Oh, welcome, welcome. Please
sign in. Take a flyer.

09:31.310 --> 09:34.070
- There's juice and cookies in the kitchen.
- Thank you.

09:34.080 --> 09:38.950
I know, you think you'd never use
a bidet, but trust me, once you do,

09:38.970 --> 09:42.030
you'll never go back to just wiping.

09:43.180 --> 09:47.180
Anyway, if you're not ready to buy,
the owners are willing to lease.

09:47.190 --> 09:49.760
Thank you.

09:50.130 --> 09:53.420
You're very welcome. Thanks for coming.

09:53.790 --> 09:57.240
Oh, the rat bastards live
right across the street.

09:58.750 --> 10:01.880
They probably just came
for the free cookies.

10:01.890 --> 10:03.990
Um, Mom, I have to go to the bathroom.

10:04.030 --> 10:06.180
Number one or number two?

10:06.510 --> 10:08.440
What difference does it make?

10:08.450 --> 10:11.010
Alan,I'm trying to sell a house here.

10:11.040 --> 10:14.840
Warm cookie smell, good--
hot poop smell, bad.

10:16.910 --> 10:19.580
- I'll wait.
- You're damn right you'll wait.

10:19.590 --> 10:21.990
So the people who own this
live mostly in New York?

10:22.030 --> 10:23.820
Oh, they have homes all over the place.

10:23.850 --> 10:25.990
Probably don't even
remember they have this one.

10:26.020 --> 10:29.920
- Hardly seems fair.
- Want fair? Go live on a kibbutz.

10:30.350 --> 10:34.280
Funny. How's that work, exactly?
Do you have to be Jewish?

10:34.680 --> 10:37.210
Oh, welcome, welcome. Please sign in.

10:37.220 --> 10:39.780
Uh, there's juice and
cookies in the kitchen.

10:48.520 --> 10:51.290
Loose floorboard.

10:54.540 --> 10:58.090
Okay, we need to talk about
your kid and my fiancée.

10:58.100 --> 11:01.500
I already talked to him, and he promised
to stay out of her underwear drawer.

11:02.120 --> 11:03.900
What?

11:04.750 --> 11:08.240
Not that he ever went into
it. It's just a precaution.

11:09.230 --> 11:10.350
Alan, I don't think you realize...

11:10.380 --> 11:13.530
Look, look, look, I would love to have this
conversation, but I've got to get to work.

11:13.540 --> 11:15.910
- It's 9:00 at night.
- Tell that to our mother.

11:15.920 --> 11:19.040
People want to see a house at night and she's
got a date, guess who has to show the house?

11:19.050 --> 11:21.570
Well, fine, at least take
the rhesus monkey with you.

11:21.600 --> 11:27.180
Oh yeah, nothing sells a multi-million dollar home
more than a 15-year-old boy with greasy hair and BO.

11:28.990 --> 11:32.750
Okay, let him stand on the lawn in
a jockey costume, holding a lantern.

11:32.760 --> 11:34.860
Look, you're the one who said
I needed to get my own place.

11:34.880 --> 11:36.600
This is what I got to do.

11:36.610 --> 11:40.690
You don't fool me. You're
never leaving. Never!

11:42.440 --> 11:45.590
That's it. I'm done
trying with that kid.

11:51.200 --> 11:54.460
When did my life turn
into Leave it to Beaver?

11:57.010 --> 12:00.590
It was more fun when it
was Leave it to Beaver.

12:01.060 --> 12:03.820
- Okay, numb nuts, what did you say to Chelsea?
- Nothing.

12:03.830 --> 12:06.410
- Then why is she so upset?
- I don't know.

12:06.420 --> 12:10.400
Maybe it's her period. She says
it wasn't, but I don't believe her.

12:30.890 --> 12:33.680
Welcome to our love
nest, my tiny sparrow.

12:40.950 --> 12:42.920
This is unbelievable.

12:42.940 --> 12:44.570
How can you afford it?

12:44.610 --> 12:46.690
Well, I didn't buy it,
of course. I'm renting.

12:47.710 --> 12:48.960
I don't get it.

12:48.990 --> 12:50.690
Just the other day we were
going to do it in your car

12:50.730 --> 12:54.020
because you didn't want to
shell out $59 for a hotel room.

12:54.060 --> 12:57.820
It was $69, but, uh...
But this is different.

12:57.830 --> 13:01.030
I, uh... I get a tax break on
it. You know, the home office.

13:01.440 --> 13:03.480
So, you've moved out of
your brother's house?

13:03.520 --> 13:06.700
Uh, well, not quite yet.
This is just a pied-a-terre.

13:06.710 --> 13:10.070
Besides, I might flip it and move
up to something a little bigger.

13:10.640 --> 13:12.920
But you said you're renting.

13:13.310 --> 13:18.330
Yes, yes,I'm renting...
with-with an option to flip.

13:19.720 --> 13:24.160
But let's not talk
money. Let's talk love.

13:27.510 --> 13:29.700
Shall we go try out the bed?

13:29.710 --> 13:33.520
The bed? With the--
with the sheets?

13:34.610 --> 13:36.900
Beds are so bourgeois, don't you think?

13:36.930 --> 13:39.170
Ooh, Alan. The couch?

13:39.180 --> 13:45.660
Uh, actually I was thinking right
here in front of the fireplace...

13:46.370 --> 13:49.290
on this beach towel.

13:53.420 --> 13:55.510
Come on. I was trying to be nice.

13:55.520 --> 13:58.240
By asking her if she was on her period?

13:58.250 --> 14:01.100
- I was taking an interest.
- You're an idiot.

14:01.110 --> 14:04.020
Why are you making it personal?
I'm not making it personal.

14:06.840 --> 14:08.360
Okay, here's the deal.

14:08.420 --> 14:10.520
You two are going to stay in
here and work this thing out

14:10.550 --> 14:13.620
until you're either getting
along or one of you is dead.

14:14.150 --> 14:17.020
FYI, she can kick your ass.

14:18.090 --> 14:20.500
Have fun.

14:29.160 --> 14:32.780
So... I guess you owe me an apology.

14:39.140 --> 14:42.130
I've never seen you
so forceful and virile.

14:42.140 --> 14:44.790
Oh, thank you, thank you.
You were wonderful, too.

14:45.490 --> 14:47.880
You're-You're still on the towel, right?

14:49.120 --> 14:50.710
You know what I think?

14:50.740 --> 14:54.130
I think finally making love in a place
of our own has given you more confidence.

14:54.140 --> 14:58.140
Well, truth be told, I
do feel kind of cocky.

14:58.500 --> 15:00.270
No pun intended.

15:00.290 --> 15:02.290
- Oh, it is so intended.
- You got me.

15:02.960 --> 15:05.100
Yes, I do.

15:07.660 --> 15:10.640
I want to make love to you
in every room in this house.

15:10.650 --> 15:12.850
I don't see any reason why not.

15:12.860 --> 15:15.420
As long as we bring the towel.

15:15.830 --> 15:18.290
Of course, we're going to have
to wait about a half hour,

15:18.300 --> 15:23.050
give my erectile medication a chance
to overcome my anti-depressants.

15:24.110 --> 15:26.560
Complicated man, Alan Harper.

15:26.570 --> 15:29.810
And I've got the medicine
chest to prove it.

15:30.360 --> 15:33.510
- Whoopsie.
- Oh, damn it!

15:33.910 --> 15:35.400
Sorry.

15:35.410 --> 15:37.770
Sorry doesn't get out the stain.

15:37.780 --> 15:39.910
- Do you have any club soda?
- How the hell would I know?

15:39.920 --> 15:42.280
Don't rub! Blot, blot, blot!

15:42.290 --> 15:44.960
- Stop yelling at me!
- Just get out of the way.

15:44.970 --> 15:47.160
- What is wrong with you?
- Nothing. I just...

15:47.170 --> 15:49.770
Oh, no!

15:51.070 --> 15:53.480
That's your whoopsie.

15:54.000 --> 15:55.680
Oh, my mother's going to kill me!

15:55.720 --> 15:57.070
What does your mother
have to do with it?

15:57.080 --> 16:00.360
Are you kidding? She doesn't
even let me poop here!

16:06.460 --> 16:08.740
Hey, so, how did everything work out?

16:08.750 --> 16:10.860
Sit down, Charlie.

16:11.250 --> 16:13.680
- Why?
- Just sit.

16:15.460 --> 16:17.840
Okay.

16:19.010 --> 16:20.910
What's going on?

16:20.920 --> 16:22.950
We figured out what the
problem is between us.

16:22.980 --> 16:25.450
- Well, great. What is it?
- You.

16:26.210 --> 16:28.550
Well, this ought to be good.

16:28.880 --> 16:32.990
You told Jake that he should be nice
to me because I was oversensitive?

16:33.690 --> 16:36.740
Well, I don't know that I
said those actual words.

16:36.750 --> 16:40.880
And you called me a "D" student
with a perpetual... you know what.

16:40.890 --> 16:44.880
Boner. Yeah, those were my actual words.

16:46.130 --> 16:50.080
Charlie, don't you see how you're the one
who's been driving a wedge between us?

16:50.760 --> 16:52.730
No, not really.

16:52.770 --> 16:55.300
I told you he wouldn't get it.

16:55.550 --> 16:57.610
Well, hang on a second. Hang on.

16:57.930 --> 17:01.180
You're blaming me because you
two can't get along and now...

17:03.270 --> 17:07.280
You're right. You're
right. I'm the problem.

17:07.290 --> 17:10.160
I am so sorr It won't ever happen again.

17:10.720 --> 17:12.829
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

17:20.550 --> 17:23.450
"Perpetual" means "pointy," right?

17:29.800 --> 17:33.120
Okay, I think I got it all out.

17:33.790 --> 17:35.960
You didn't have to yell.

17:35.970 --> 17:39.260
I know. I'm... I'm sorry. I
don't know what got into me.

17:39.520 --> 17:42.070
- It was just an accident.
- I know.

17:42.390 --> 17:44.480
You hurt my feelings.

17:44.500 --> 17:47.680
Again, I am so sorry.

17:49.330 --> 17:52.450
Come here.

18:05.230 --> 18:09.610
Now, wait till you see the panoramic
city to ocean views at night.

18:16.520 --> 18:17.410
Why are we running?

18:17.430 --> 18:20.140
- Well, remember when I told you I rented this house?
- Yeah?

18:20.150 --> 18:21.940
I lied.

18:24.630 --> 18:26.820
Oh, no. Not again.

18:27.400 --> 18:32.500
Okay. Okay. Just let me
do the talking. Melissa?

18:33.300 --> 18:37.050
Get down on your knees, and
put your hands behind your head.

18:37.940 --> 18:43.170
Uh, okay. Okay. First of all,
let me explain the erection.

19:04.340 --> 19:06.250
What's going on?

19:06.810 --> 19:08.420
Not much.

19:08.440 --> 19:10.250
Where's Jake and Chelsea?

19:10.270 --> 19:12.110
They went to the movies together.

19:12.120 --> 19:13.900
Oh, how nice.

19:14.210 --> 19:17.380
Yep. Life is good.

19:19.110 --> 19:21.050
So, did you sell that house?

19:21.080 --> 19:25.140
Uh, no. Actually,I'm not
working for Mom anymore.

19:25.630 --> 19:27.630
You quit?

19:28.080 --> 19:30.370
Yeah, let's say that.

19:30.850 --> 19:33.430
And while we're at it,
let's say I dumped Melissa

19:33.440 --> 19:36.560
and decided she never wants to
see me again as long as she lives.

19:37.730 --> 19:39.980
Okay.

19:40.780 --> 19:44.240
Oh, uh, hey, you know how they say
if you take one of those pills

19:44.270 --> 19:48.250
and your erection lasts for more than
four hours, you should call a doctor?

19:48.530 --> 19:51.320
- Yeah.
- What time is it?
