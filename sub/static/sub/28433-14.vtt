Who's there?
Not a ham to look at.

18:37.855 --> 18:41.032
Oh, I don't hear
any laughing now.

18:41.076 --> 18:42.295
Sinking in, huh?

18:42.338 --> 18:43.600
It's sinking in what happened.

18:43.644 --> 18:45.559
Good.
I want it to.

18:45.602 --> 18:47.082
Think long and hard.

18:47.126 --> 18:49.780
Me? I'll be downstairs
with Stan, having fun,

18:49.824 --> 18:52.783
looking at the ham
whenever I want.

18:52.827 --> 18:54.394
[ Man farts ]

18:54.437 --> 18:56.526
Who did it? Who was it?
I'll smell every ass in --

18:59.094 --> 19:01.096
It's time, Arturo.

19:01.140 --> 19:02.489
No.

19:02.532 --> 19:05.187
Not for that, silly,
for me and Stan's ham.

19:05.231 --> 19:06.667
It's gonna be nice.

19:07.494 --> 19:08.973
I hope this works.

19:09.017 --> 19:10.192
So, how do you
want to serve it?

19:10.236 --> 19:11.324
Real thick-like?

19:11.367 --> 19:13.413
Super thin.Like prosciutto.

19:13.456 --> 19:15.458
American prosciutto.

19:15.502 --> 19:17.199
Again
with the correcting.

19:17.243 --> 19:24.250
♪♪

19:27.166 --> 19:28.341
I don't understand.

19:28.384 --> 19:30.430
I can see there's
no tricking you, Stan,

19:30.473 --> 19:31.387
so I'll just come clean.

19:31.431 --> 19:33.868
I poisoned
our redemption ham.

19:33.911 --> 19:34.999
Why, you ask?

19:35.043 --> 19:36.697
Because I was having
so much fun with you,

19:36.740 --> 19:39.526
and I knew if the men
got better, we'd leave.

19:39.569 --> 19:41.615
I think it was just always
about that.

19:41.658 --> 19:45.401
Joining the club, I just wanted
to spend time with you.

19:45.445 --> 19:46.446
I'm sorry.

19:46.489 --> 19:48.056
No, I'm sorry.

19:48.099 --> 19:49.275
I was a jerk.

19:49.318 --> 19:50.754
You said
no one would like me.

19:50.798 --> 19:52.800
I know,
and I was wrong.

19:52.843 --> 19:54.976
Plus, you taught me
to take ham.

19:55.019 --> 19:57.413
Do you have any ideahow big that is?

19:57.457 --> 19:59.850
Hug time?

19:59.894 --> 20:01.548
I also poisoned
the first ham.

20:01.591 --> 20:03.245
What?The ham you poisoned?

20:03.289 --> 20:04.507
I also poisoned it.

20:04.551 --> 20:06.074
Like, a lot.Why'd you do that?

20:06.117 --> 20:07.293
To get you to Maine,
man.

20:07.336 --> 20:08.511
How great is it here?

20:08.555 --> 20:09.556
Very great.

20:09.599 --> 20:11.210
You know what's not
so very great?

20:11.253 --> 20:12.254
The men.

20:12.298 --> 20:14.822
Ah, yes, the sticky question
of the men.

20:14.865 --> 20:16.302
I've been thinking on this,
Stan,

20:16.345 --> 20:19.000
and when I put my mind
to something, watch out,

20:19.043 --> 20:21.524
because
great things can occur.

20:21.568 --> 20:24.005
Were you gonna
say an idea?

20:24.048 --> 20:26.442
Oh, yeah. I'll stop feeding thempoison hams.

20:26.486 --> 20:27.748
I'll also stop
poisoning their water.

20:27.791 --> 20:29.532
I've been poisoning
their water.

20:29.576 --> 20:31.317
Although, I will say, I think
they like the poison water

20:31.360 --> 20:32.840
even though
it's bad for them.

20:32.883 --> 20:35.016
People don't know
what's good for them, Stan.

20:38.585 --> 20:41.675
-Let us out of here!
-My family thinks I'm dead!

20:41.718 --> 20:43.198
There's gonna be
hell to pay!

20:43.242 --> 20:46.375
The men seem to be thriving,
Roger.I'll say.

20:46.419 --> 20:49.378
You know, if we're gonna do thatlittle detour to Lake Champlain,

20:49.422 --> 20:50.945
which I would
really like to do,

20:50.988 --> 20:52.642
the men will
have to be subdued.

20:52.686 --> 20:54.949
Oh, we're doing
the trip.

20:54.992 --> 20:58.344
Alright, piggies,
it's watering time.

20:58.387 --> 21:02.261
Oh, boy!
Water!

21:02.304 --> 21:04.132
Bye-bye. See you soon.
