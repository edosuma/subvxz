Yeah, he gave me
some awesome advice.

18:06.753 --> 18:09.487
You should
cherish him more.

18:09.489 --> 18:10.588
Uh-huh.

18:10.590 --> 18:11.622
Thank you, zozo.

18:11.624 --> 18:13.257
Good night.
Yeah.

18:13.259 --> 18:15.126
Okay.

18:15.794 --> 18:19.430
You have got to tell me
what she said.

18:19.432 --> 18:21.632
I have
absolutely no idea.

18:21.634 --> 18:23.267
I mean,
I listened to her,

18:23.269 --> 18:26.270
Gave her some generic advice
in a deep, soothing voice.

18:26.272 --> 18:29.340
I morgan freeman-ed her.

18:34.346 --> 18:35.780
Hey.

18:35.782 --> 18:37.648
Oh, dad,
I'm glad you're here.

18:37.650 --> 18:40.585
I've got some --
nope. No. I'm done.

18:40.587 --> 18:43.187
Son, look,
the last few days

18:43.189 --> 18:45.890
Have been the most open
and honest we've ever had...

18:45.892 --> 18:47.625
And I hated it.

18:47.627 --> 18:49.827
Hey, not you.

18:49.829 --> 18:52.830
I love you.
Love you, son.

18:52.832 --> 18:54.832
That's why I wanted to be
a part of this.

18:54.834 --> 18:58.402
I-I wanted to be in the loop...
But only for the big stuff.

18:58.404 --> 19:00.538
I don't need
the play-by-play.

19:00.540 --> 19:02.473
Oh, you mean like
how I enjoy --

19:02.475 --> 19:03.875
Exactly. Mnh.

19:03.877 --> 19:06.577
Keep going to your mother
with the day-to-day, all right?

19:06.579 --> 19:08.412
She lives
for this stuff.

19:08.414 --> 19:12.416
But the big stuff?
I'm your guy.

19:12.418 --> 19:14.919
I will always
take my shirt off for you.

19:14.921 --> 19:18.422
Um, dad, I talked to my friends
about that,

19:18.424 --> 19:20.324
And that's not a thing.

19:20.326 --> 19:24.262
Son...
It's<i> our</i> thing.

19:24.264 --> 19:26.264
No, seriously, dad,
it's weird.

19:31.503 --> 19:36.374
Wow.
You're ninja-quiet.

19:36.376 --> 19:38.776
I've been watching you,
son --

19:38.778 --> 19:41.179
Watching you try
and connect up with junior

19:41.181 --> 19:42.813
The last couple of days.

19:42.815 --> 19:45.883
I have to say,
it's embarrassing.

19:45.885 --> 19:48.519
I hear you, pops.

19:48.521 --> 19:49.787
What you're saying is,

19:49.789 --> 19:51.389
You regret never having
the talk with me,

19:51.391 --> 19:52.657
Which meant
I didn't have the tools

19:52.659 --> 19:53.824
To have the talk
with junior.

19:53.826 --> 19:55.193
That's not even close
to what I'm saying.

19:55.195 --> 19:56.727
I get it.

19:56.729 --> 19:59.564
You were busy working hard,
providing for us,

19:59.566 --> 20:01.866
And communicating openly
with your kids

20:01.868 --> 20:05.269
Wasn't a priority
for your generation.

20:05.271 --> 20:07.505
Could have made it a priority.
Chose not to.

20:07.507 --> 20:10.975
But you're proud of me
for trying.

20:13.612 --> 20:14.845
[ sighs ]

20:14.847 --> 20:16.881
Every day.

20:16.883 --> 20:18.849
<i>Wow.</i>

20:18.851 --> 20:22.486
<i>That was a lot better than when</i>
<i>he gave me a box of condoms.</i>

20:22.488 --> 20:25.323
<i>So, junior</i> and<i> pops --</i>

20:25.325 --> 20:27.959
<i>Two moments</i>
<i>of real personal growth.</i>

20:27.961 --> 20:30.595
<i>Now, I know</i>
<i>it might have been greedy,</i>

20:30.597 --> 20:32.430
<i>But I was gonna go for a third.</i>

20:32.432 --> 20:34.865
Dre...
This has gone too far.

20:34.867 --> 20:36.901
You haven't worn clothes
for two days.

20:36.903 --> 20:38.436
Clothes are for suckers.

20:38.438 --> 20:40.871
I'm gonna go outside
and get the paper.

20:42.874 --> 20:44.275
While you're out there,

20:44.277 --> 20:46.911
You might as well
get the mail, too.

20:46.913 --> 20:48.946
[ sighs ]

20:53.418 --> 20:54.952
Do you realize
we've gotten less attention

20:54.954 --> 20:58.289
I can't even get mom
to comb my hair.

20:58.291 --> 21:00.791
Well, if they're not gonna
give us the talk,

21:00.793 --> 21:02.493
Let's give it
to each other.

21:02.495 --> 21:03.794
We don't even know
what the talk's about.

21:03.796 --> 21:05.496
All I know is that
you lower your voice...

21:05.498 --> 21:06.931
[deep voice]
...And sound serious.

21:06.933 --> 21:08.666
I can do that.

21:08.668 --> 21:09.934
[ normal voice ]
okay. Let's do it.

21:09.936 --> 21:12.336
[ deep voice ] diane,
I'd like to talk to you

21:12.338 --> 21:15.339
About the difference
between jam and jelly.

21:15.341 --> 21:18.342
Now, I think --
unh. Let me stop you
right there.

21:18.344 --> 21:19.944
You're boring me.
