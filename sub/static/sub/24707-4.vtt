Previously on NYPD Blue.

00:03.260 --> 00:05.955
Greg, James and I are friends.
That's what we're gonna be.

00:06.030 --> 00:08.794
You don't think that something
could develop, huh? Down the road?

00:08.866 --> 00:12.267
Greg, I'm gay.

00:12.336 --> 00:15.271
You're not supposed to tell anyone
until after the first trimester.

00:15.339 --> 00:17.273
- I know.
- What if something goes wrong?

00:17.341 --> 00:21.402
This baby thing is just
so emotional... in a good way.

00:21.479 --> 00:24.277
- But I'm gonna make you nuts here.
- What's going on?

00:24.348 --> 00:29.718
I've had two beers.
I'm about to go to boilermakers...

00:29.787 --> 00:31.914
and I wanna stop.

00:56.981 --> 01:00.109
- How's it goin', Sylvia?
- How's it going?

01:00.184 --> 01:03.085
Great.

01:06.090 --> 01:08.888
- You're goin' to 27, huh?
- Yes.

01:08.959 --> 01:11.393
Eventually.

01:11.462 --> 01:13.760
All right, I'm gonna
go ahead then, okay?

01:13.831 --> 01:15.958
Good.

01:16.033 --> 01:19.434
- You want me to stay here?
- No. Go to work.

01:27.678 --> 01:31.170
- I made the bed.
- Good.

01:42.059 --> 01:45.426
- Good morning, James.
- How's it goin'?

01:45.496 --> 01:47.361
Checkin'61 s.
You must be feelin'pretty good.

01:47.431 --> 01:50.423
- Yeah, I'm feelin' pretty good.
- Stronger every day?

01:50.501 --> 01:52.435
I'm stronger every day, Adrianne.

01:52.503 --> 01:57.406
So you don't have to talk to me like I'm
a patient no more, or like I'm four years old.

01:57.475 --> 01:59.466
Okay.

02:02.780 --> 02:05.943
So, James, how's things with you and her?

02:06.016 --> 02:07.847
- Nothin's goin' on.
- No?

02:07.918 --> 02:10.386
No. She's-She's gay.
She's a lesbian.

02:12.056 --> 02:14.581
- Whoa.
- Yeah.

02:14.658 --> 02:17.252
Whoa. Lesniak's gay.

02:17.328 --> 02:20.456
Yeah. How about that, huh?

02:26.871 --> 02:29.533
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

02:29.607 --> 02:31.199
Good morning.

02:31.275 --> 02:33.368
I looked for you at
the speakers' meeting last night.

02:33.444 --> 02:36.140
Yeah, I couldn't make it. Um...

02:36.213 --> 02:40.877
Andy, that family situation I had-
I drank over it.

02:40.951 --> 02:42.885
- You're supposed to call me.
- I called Bobby.

02:42.953 --> 02:48.914
- He came and got me. I stopped after two beers.
- Then what happened?

02:48.993 --> 02:51.655
- Then we went home.
- And then the two of you pretended it never happened?

02:51.729 --> 02:54.425
- Morning, Andy.
- Yeah, morning.

02:54.498 --> 02:58.025
Bobby, Andy, we got a multiple homicide.

03:00.871 --> 03:03.135
- Good morning.
- Hey.

03:07.578 --> 03:09.671
Okay.

04:44.416 --> 04:47.283
- Got two dead kids upstairs, both shot.
- Who's in the ambulance?

04:47.352 --> 04:50.116
Woman shot in the head.
Looks like she's going out of the picture.

04:50.188 --> 04:53.089
- It's bad upstairs.
- Okay. Thanks.

04:56.595 --> 04:58.927
Looks like somebody put
some money into this place.

04:58.997 --> 05:02.626
- Any plans telling me she drank?
- I figured it was on Diane to tell you, Andy.

05:02.701 --> 05:05.329
She didn't talk to you
before we went out?

05:05.404 --> 05:09.397
Looks like a robbery/homicide.
Bodies are on the bed.

05:25.657 --> 05:30.560
Oh, man. Shot in the head.
Little boy, five or six.

05:30.629 --> 05:35.293
This is just a baby, maybe two months old,
shot in the back of the head.

05:39.504 --> 05:42.996
These kids live here?
We got any witnesses?

05:43.074 --> 05:45.201
They lived here with their mother-
LaVonna Runnels.

05:45.277 --> 05:47.438
Looks like the mother
went out the window.

05:47.512 --> 05:49.980
Next-door neighbor
found her shot in the yard.

05:50.048 --> 05:53.814
Gladys Benton's the neighbor's name.
She lives on that side.

05:53.885 --> 05:56.319
All right. I want Crime Scene
to get a sample of this blood.

05:56.388 --> 05:58.379
Andy, check this out.

06:01.426 --> 06:03.621
Looks like they got what they came for.

06:03.695 --> 06:07.426
This was drugs or drug money.
I wanna get to the hospital.

06:07.499 --> 06:10.627
If that woman's alive, I wanna hear if the
high life was worth gettin'her kids killed.

06:10.702 --> 06:14.832
- We gotta talk to the neighbor.
- But then I wanna get to that hospital.

06:18.477 --> 06:21.207
Thanks.

06:25.083 --> 06:28.450
Two babies.
They murdered two babies.

06:28.520 --> 06:32.808
I got it.
You Mrs. Denton?

06:32.941 --> 06:35.205
- Yes, I am.
- What happened over there?

06:35.277 --> 06:37.507
All I know is I heard a lot ofhollerin'.

06:37.579 --> 06:40.070
I looked out the back window.
I didn't see nothin'.

06:40.149 --> 06:42.242
After a little while, I heard shootin'.

06:42.317 --> 06:47.016
So I looked again.
I saw Miss Runnels layin' in the backyard...

06:47.089 --> 06:48.716
her head all bloody.

06:48.791 --> 06:51.419
- You didn't see anybody running in or out?
- No, I didn't see anybody.

06:51.493 --> 06:54.155
- Who's the man livin' there?
- Mr. Runnels?

06:54.229 --> 06:57.528
He got sent to prison
must be a couple of months ago.

06:57.599 --> 07:00.432
- He's a millionaire.
- He's a dope dealer. That's what you mean, right?

07:00.502 --> 07:02.732
I thought he was a businessman.

07:02.805 --> 07:06.366
Wearin' $2,000 overcoats in this neighborhood,
driving around in a Rolls-Royce?

07:06.442 --> 07:08.876
You knew he was dealing dope
out of that house!

07:08.944 --> 07:11.344
He didn't have a Rolls-Royce.

07:11.413 --> 07:13.608
- I thought he was in business.
- Yeah.

07:13.682 --> 07:15.707
Maybe a banker would like
to live here, huh?

07:15.784 --> 07:18.082
The kind of guy whose enemies
would like to execute his kids.

07:18.153 --> 07:21.680
- Whoa, Andy.
- Mister, you gonna talk to me like that?

07:21.757 --> 07:24.692
- I'm gonna go.
- Hey, you refusin' to talk to us?

07:24.760 --> 07:27.729
I'm about through talkin' to you.
I already told the police everything.

07:27.796 --> 07:30.594
- You can talk to them!
- You wanna do this down at the station house?

07:30.666 --> 07:33.191
Let's go. Come on.

07:48.484 --> 07:50.418
Detectives, 15th Squad.

07:50.486 --> 07:52.579
You got a LaVonna Runnels
going in for a CAT scan?

07:52.654 --> 07:54.986
- Yeah. They're bringing her down.
- How bad was she hurt?

07:55.057 --> 07:56.991
She might be okay.
One bullet went through.

07:57.059 --> 07:59.653
The other's still in her.
But she's talking all right.

07:59.728 --> 08:02.856
- Well, here she is. I gotta take her in.
- Wait. Hang on a second.

08:02.931 --> 08:05.024
- Mrs. Runnels?
- Yes?

08:05.100 --> 08:08.297
- Can't you do somethin' about my wrist?
- I'm Detective Sipowicz.

08:08.370 --> 08:12.067
- This is my partner Simone.
- We're really sorry about what happened to your children.

08:12.140 --> 08:15.337
That little bitch Chantal done this.

08:15.410 --> 08:17.605
- They shot my kids.
- What's Chantal's last name?

08:17.679 --> 08:23.083
I don't know. She's Sister Cecilia's
daughter, live next door.

08:23.151 --> 08:26.951
Asked could she use my phone.
I didn't see the others till I opened the door.

08:27.022 --> 08:29.252
One of'em hit me right in thejaw.

08:29.324 --> 08:31.258
Who were they?

08:31.326 --> 08:33.851
One's her husband.
I don't know his name.

08:33.929 --> 08:36.124
And the other guys,
I ain't ever seen 'em before.

08:36.198 --> 08:40.328
- And what did her husband look like?
- Looked Puerto Rican.

08:40.402 --> 08:44.998
- Them other two, they was black.
- Chantal knew you had a safe?

08:45.073 --> 08:47.166
- Yeah.
- How much was in it?

08:47.242 --> 08:50.939
- About 20,000.
- Mrs. Runnels, how were the children shot?

08:51.013 --> 08:54.847
They tore up the house.

08:54.917 --> 08:58.045
They thought I was holdin' out.
Said they was gonna shoot William...

08:58.120 --> 09:01.521
if I didn't tell 'em
where the rest of the money was at.

09:01.590 --> 09:05.458
Then, um, Chantal said to her husband...

09:05.527 --> 09:07.688
Shoot 'em."

09:07.763 --> 09:11.859
And, um, then they shot William.

09:11.934 --> 09:15.529
- How old's William?
- Five.

09:17.472 --> 09:22.068
And Lonnie was... seven weeks old.

09:22.144 --> 09:24.237
Did the husband shoot Lonnie too?

09:24.313 --> 09:27.578
I couldn't look.
L- I heard the gun.

09:29.251 --> 09:34.188
And they shot Lonnie. And then
they found somethin' up in the ceiling.

09:34.256 --> 09:36.383
They found something?
They found more money?

09:36.458 --> 09:40.292
And when they was gettin' it,
I jumped.

09:40.362 --> 09:42.387
And that's when they shot me.

09:42.464 --> 09:45.524
I thought I had been hit
with a hammer.

09:45.601 --> 09:48.092
You don't give up where the money is
while they killed your kids...

09:48.170 --> 09:50.570
and then you tell 'em
so you won't get killed?

09:50.639 --> 09:53.107
- You think I wasn't tryin' to help my kids?
- Helpin' 'em how?

09:53.175 --> 09:55.837
- Andy!
- How are you helping your kids...

09:55.911 --> 09:58.209
if they get shot in that bed
and you wind up out the window?

09:58.280 --> 10:00.077
What the hell's wrong with this man?

10:00.148 --> 10:02.844
- She needs to go for her tests.
- We're not through talking to her.

10:02.918 --> 10:04.852
I'm through now.
Go ahead and push this thing.

10:04.920 --> 10:10.085
Mrs. Runnels, we don't mean to upset you,
but we'd like to talk to you some more.

10:10.158 --> 10:13.355
The hell with you, hear?
The hell with you, man!

10:24.973 --> 10:27.999
- Andy, you sure you wanna work this one?
- Why? You think I'm screwing up?

10:28.076 --> 10:31.239
Well, yeah. You're lettin' the mood that
you're in get in the way of your work.

10:31.313 --> 10:33.838
Don't you tell me how to do my job.
I'm workin' this case.

10:33.915 --> 10:37.282
If you don't like it, you can get off.

10:37.352 --> 10:39.718
Are you comin',
or aren't you in the mood?

10:54.903 --> 10:57.804
Nope.

10:57.873 --> 11:00.671
- Ma'am, do you live here?
- Yes.

11:00.742 --> 11:03.768
I'm Detective Simone. This is
Detective Sipowicz. Can I have your name?

11:03.845 --> 11:05.972
- I'm Sister Cecilia.
- What's your last name?

11:06.048 --> 11:09.643
Don't use one.
Everyone calls me Sister Cecilia.

11:09.718 --> 11:12.278
- That's how they got me in the phone book.
- How long you been out?

11:12.354 --> 11:14.618
Most of the day.
What's going on here?

11:14.690 --> 11:17.853
- There was a robbery next door. Mrs. Runnels's place.
- Oh. She all right?

11:17.926 --> 11:20.554
She's in the hospital.
Look, we got some information...

11:20.629 --> 11:23.689
that the suspects ran
into your apartment afterwards.

11:23.765 --> 11:26.199
- Can we come in and take a look around briefly?
- They broke in here too?

11:26.268 --> 11:29.533
- They might have. Maybe they stole something.
- Geez!

11:29.604 --> 11:32.266
Come in. Come in.

11:40.982 --> 11:45.646
- All right. Stay right there.
- Anybody else live here?

11:45.721 --> 11:50.658
My daughter and her husband.
But I don't think they're home. Chantal?

11:50.726 --> 11:53.388
- They just got married two weeks ago.
- How old is your daughter?

11:53.462 --> 11:55.987
She's 17.

11:57.232 --> 11:59.166
This is the marriage certificate, huh?

11:59.234 --> 12:02.397
- Raoul Calderon?
- That's her husband.

12:02.471 --> 12:06.373
- You know where we can find him?
- I don't know where they are.

12:06.441 --> 12:09.706
- They went out last night.
I left early this morning to market.

12:09.778 --> 12:13.111
I have to go all the way uptown.
I shop for special food.

12:21.590 --> 12:23.854
What's this all about?

12:23.925 --> 12:26.917
- That is where I do my church work.
- You a preacher?

12:26.995 --> 12:30.431
- I lead the service.
- What church is it?

12:31.867 --> 12:35.963
It is many things.
It's from my country- Haiti.

12:36.037 --> 12:37.732
Oh, you're from Haiti.

12:37.806 --> 12:41.435
Andy, come in here.

12:47.816 --> 12:49.807
- You know anything about these?
- What is that?

12:49.885 --> 12:51.409
- They're bullets.
- No.

12:51.486 --> 12:54.284
- You don't know anything about these?
- Not at all.

12:54.356 --> 12:57.484
.380s and.38s.
Does Raoul own guns?

12:57.559 --> 12:59.925
I don't think so.
I've never seen any.

12:59.995 --> 13:04.932
I'm gonna have to take these. Sister, your daughter
and Raoul, they're suspects in a murder.

13:05.000 --> 13:06.661
Those two little boys
were shot next door.

13:06.735 --> 13:09.898
- They're dead?
- Yeah, they're dead.

13:09.971 --> 13:12.769
- And your daughter and this Raoul killed them.
- No! You crazy?

13:12.841 --> 13:15.742
- They'd never do that. Never.
- They were both identified, Sister.

13:15.811 --> 13:18.803
That Mrs. Runnels,
she don't like Chantal.

13:18.880 --> 13:21.747
She don't like her
'cause she's a thief and a killer!

13:21.817 --> 13:24.308
Look, what kind of daughter
you raise anyways, huh?

13:24.386 --> 13:28.186
You fill her head full of this
voodoo spells and chicken sacrifices.

13:28.256 --> 13:31.817
Chantal don't have nothin' to do
with the voodoo. It's my religion!

13:31.893 --> 13:35.852
It's not Chantal's religion!
But I know she wouldn't kill nobody!

13:35.931 --> 13:39.628
Look. You just gotta
get out of my house now.

13:39.701 --> 13:42.226
- I don't want you goin' through my house no more.
- Fine.

13:42.304 --> 13:44.636
- Thanks very much for your help, Sister.
- Go on!

13:44.706 --> 13:47.038
We really got her in our corner, huh?

13:58.386 --> 14:01.355
- So, both the D.O.A. S were kids.
- Five and two months.

14:01.423 --> 14:04.824
Mother watches 'em executed. She don't wanna
give up where the drug money's stashed.

14:04.893 --> 14:07.361
- She watched it?
- Sounds like that's how it could've happened.

14:07.429 --> 14:10.990
I'm tellin' you,
that's how it happened.

14:12.934 --> 14:15.164
So did she say who did it?

14:15.237 --> 14:17.865
She said the next-door neighbor's
daughter set it up.

14:17.939 --> 14:20.066
- We went back over there to talk to the girl's mother.
- A voodoo priestess.

14:20.141 --> 14:23.804
Her daughter did it, and her daughter's
husband and two other assholes.

14:25.714 --> 14:28.239
We got a call from Ballistics.

14:28.316 --> 14:30.284
The kids were killed with a.380.

14:30.352 --> 14:32.582
That matches the ammunition we took
out of the neighbor's apartment.

14:32.654 --> 14:36.647
So we're looking for
a Raoul Calderon, Chantal...

14:36.725 --> 14:38.818
that's his wife-and two other skells.

14:38.894 --> 14:40.828
- I need to see a detective, please.
- And your name?

14:40.896 --> 14:43.865
- So what's going on with Andy?
- I don't know, and I don't want to have to deal with it.

14:43.999 --> 14:47.332
Detective? This is Roger Billings.

14:50.138 --> 14:52.402
I'm Detective Simone, Mr. Billings.
How can I help you?

14:52.474 --> 14:54.738
It's about those murdered children.

14:54.809 --> 14:57.437
Come on in.
Have a seat.

15:04.786 --> 15:08.017
So, the murdered children-
What do you know about them?

15:08.089 --> 15:13.288
Well, somebody-
Well, he's actually in the family.

15:13.361 --> 15:15.352
- He's my-my nephew.
- What's his name?

15:15.430 --> 15:19.093
Ricky Winston.

15:19.167 --> 15:21.101
He's going to pieces, man.

15:21.169 --> 15:25.162
See, he went out on a robbery with
some people- him and Arthur, his friend.

15:25.240 --> 15:28.835
I don't know what Ricky was thinking, man.
They told him nobody would get hurt.

15:28.910 --> 15:32.539
And then somebody goes in
and shoots these children.

15:32.614 --> 15:36.311
Now, it wasn't him, but he feels real bad
about it, and he doesn't know what to do.

15:36.384 --> 15:38.909
- Where's Ricky now?
- He don't know I'm here.

15:38.987 --> 15:41.751
See, he's not a bad kid.
I mean, he's not like that at all.

15:41.823 --> 15:44.121
Mr. Billings,
where can we find him?

15:44.192 --> 15:46.922
I wouldn't want anything
to happen to him now.

15:46.995 --> 15:49.395
I mean, I wouldn't want him to end up
gettin' shot or somethin' like that, okay?

15:49.464 --> 15:51.432
We wouldn't want that either.

15:51.499 --> 15:54.832
So, like, this is the next best thing
to him cooperating, right?

15:54.903 --> 15:58.395
- I mean, you will take this into account?
- What's his address?

16:02.344 --> 16:05.279
He's staying at a place
over on 11 th Street.

16:05.347 --> 16:10.842
- 1647. Second floor.
- And you mentioned Arthur? Do you know his last name?

16:10.919 --> 16:14.821
- I don't know.
- You did the right thing by coming in.

16:14.889 --> 16:19.019
- Thanks very much for your help, Mr. Billings.
- Please, don't hurt him.

16:19.094 --> 16:22.359
Well, we're gonna try not to.

16:22.430 --> 16:24.898
Thank you.

16:48.056 --> 16:50.581
Yeah?

16:50.658 --> 16:53.855
- Yo, Ricky!
- Yeah? Who is it?

16:53.928 --> 16:56.294
It's the police, Ricky.
Open the door.

16:56.364 --> 16:59.595
We wanna talk to you.

16:59.667 --> 17:01.828
You gonna open that door?

17:01.903 --> 17:03.837
Yeah, I'll open it.

17:05.973 --> 17:09.410
- Back! Get off! Back off!
- Where's Arthur?

17:09.477 --> 17:11.411
- I don't know!
- Where's the others?

17:11.479 --> 17:13.674
- I don't know!
- Put your shirt on.

17:15.250 --> 17:17.241
- Ow!
- Come on! Get out of there!

17:17.318 --> 17:19.252
Come on! Get out! Get out!

17:21.321 --> 17:22.880
- What's your name?
- Arthur!

17:22.957 --> 17:26.188
- What's your last name?
- Cartwell. Aah!

17:26.261 --> 17:28.855
I knew I never should've come over here.

17:28.930 --> 17:32.923
I ain't got nothin'to do with nothin'.
I don't know what Ricky into.

17:33.001 --> 17:34.935
I just came over here to borrow a book.

17:35.003 --> 17:38.871
Is that what you got going on here?
Some kind of a book club?

17:38.940 --> 17:42.205
Where's the money?
Where's the money you stole?

17:42.277 --> 17:45.246
- There ain't no money here!
- Uh-huh.

17:45.313 --> 17:47.247
Here.

17:49.084 --> 17:51.177
- Andy- - You kill
those kids? Huh? - No!

17:51.252 --> 17:52.776
- Did you shoot those kids in the back of the head?
- No!

17:52.854 --> 17:54.617
Come on. Let's take 'em
back to the station house.

17:54.689 --> 17:57.681
You tell me what to do one more time,
I'm gonna get real pissed off!

17:57.759 --> 18:00.523
Oh, yeah? You're gonna get pissed off?
'Cause I'm pissed off right now!

18:00.595 --> 18:03.462
Just don't order me around!

18:03.531 --> 18:07.763
Andy, I'm gonna start pickin' up this money
before me and you start hookin' and jabbin'.

18:09.704 --> 18:12.138
Come on!

18:12.207 --> 18:15.608
- Hey, I don't know nothin' about that money.
- Shut your mouth.

18:25.520 --> 18:27.454
- Take 'em separately?
- Yeah.

18:27.522 --> 18:29.513
- I got Ricky.
- Yeah.

18:32.961 --> 18:35.088
Hey, what the hell is going on with you?
Huh, Andy?

18:35.163 --> 18:38.462
- You got a problem with what I did with Diane?
- I'm her sponsor.

18:38.533 --> 18:41.900
I take it serious. You sweep a slip
under the rug, it don't go away.

18:41.970 --> 18:43.904
She said she would reach out
to you the first thing today.

18:43.972 --> 18:45.769
Now, if she didn't,
I'm surprised at that.

18:45.840 --> 18:48.809
But none of that lets you talk to me
like I'm some kind of skell!

18:48.877 --> 18:51.607
- Hey, hey! Whoa!
- We got two of'em here.

18:51.679 --> 18:54.409
Anything that puts them
in the apartment? Weapons?

18:54.482 --> 18:57.110
No weapons.
Just a lot of cash.

18:57.185 --> 19:00.018
Somebody else can count and vouch for that
if you wanna get going on the interview.

19:00.088 --> 19:02.147
No, I'll do it.
Inside. Come on.

19:02.223 --> 19:04.657
Come on. Let's go.

19:06.261 --> 19:08.695
Right in there.

19:11.866 --> 19:15.427
- I don't know nothin' about that money.
- What'd I tell you?

19:15.503 --> 19:18.267
Uh, to shut up till you tell me to talk.

19:18.339 --> 19:21.866
- Are you gonna shut up?
- Yeah.

19:32.720 --> 19:35.780
You scared?
Well, you oughta be.

19:35.857 --> 19:37.825
The mother of those kids that you shot,
she's still alive.

19:37.892 --> 19:39.860
That's right. I just finished
talking to her in the hospital.

19:39.928 --> 19:43.386
- I didn't shoot nobody!
- She gets one look at you, and you know where you're going?

19:43.464 --> 19:45.989
- Your ass is on its way to a lethal injection.
- Hey, it wasn't me!

19:46.067 --> 19:48.535
L- I was downstairs watchin' the door.

19:48.603 --> 19:51.834
I was just the lookout.
And I didn't even have a piece, man!

19:51.906 --> 19:53.669
I couldn't believe it
when they started shootin'.

19:53.741 --> 19:56.039
So who was it that killed those kids?

19:56.110 --> 19:59.671
Raoul, I guess. I mean,
Arthur said he didn't do no shootin'.

19:59.747 --> 20:03.706
- And Chantal didn't have no gun.
- When you all left the house, where did Raoul and Chantal go?

20:03.785 --> 20:05.980
We all walked to the burger place.

20:06.054 --> 20:09.421
- How far was it?
- I don't-Two or three blocks.

20:09.490 --> 20:14.120
Chantal called Denise when we got there,
and she came and picked us up in the car.

20:14.195 --> 20:17.756
- What's this Denise's last name?
- Ludlow, I think.

20:17.832 --> 20:21.632
Chantal know her!
I mean, she gave her $1,000.

20:21.703 --> 20:25.605
We were splittin' the money up in the car, and
Chantal gave her a grand just for driving us.

20:25.673 --> 20:28.767
- So where did Denise take Chantal and Raoul?
- I don't know.

20:28.843 --> 20:31.937
She let me and Arthur out first.
She'll have to tell you where she took 'em.

20:32.013 --> 20:35.141
You know where this Denise lives?

20:35.216 --> 20:38.014
Over by me at her mother's place
on Fourth Street and Avenue B."

20:38.086 --> 20:41.214
She got a big poster of
Snoop Doggy Dogg in the window.

20:54.227 --> 20:56.718
What's goin' on?

20:58.298 --> 21:03.429
I'm trying to get my stomach settled
to hear what you got to say.

21:03.503 --> 21:06.563
Man, I told you, I wasn't there.

21:06.640 --> 21:11.577
Hey, Arthur, the woman
who went out the window?

21:11.645 --> 21:14.409
She's alive.

21:14.481 --> 21:18.815
- She's gonna pick you out.
- Man...

21:18.885 --> 21:22.685
Maybe you should go
for self-defense, Arthur.

21:22.756 --> 21:26.590
Say that seven-week-old baby
came at you with a handgun.

21:26.660 --> 21:28.958
I didn't shoot nobody.

21:30.931 --> 21:33.297
Maybe somebody-
Uh, uh, uh. Uh-uh.

21:33.367 --> 21:36.268
Sit down. Just sit down.

21:39.005 --> 21:42.133
Maybe somebody told you
to shoot that baby.

21:42.209 --> 21:45.542
Did Raoul make you do it? Hmm?

21:45.612 --> 21:47.603
Chantal's husband?

21:51.084 --> 21:53.348
- He tried, but I wouldn't.
- Maybe you thought...

21:53.420 --> 21:57.151
If I don't shoot that baby,
Raoul's gonna shoot me."

21:57.224 --> 21:59.158
Is that how it happened?

21:59.226 --> 22:03.754
He keep yelling at me to do it,
actin' crazy.

22:03.830 --> 22:07.857
- But I still wouldn't.
- 'Cause you're a stand-up guy.

22:07.934 --> 22:11.529
Man, I just went in for the money.
Wasn't nobody supposed to get shot.

22:11.605 --> 22:15.803
Everything just went wrong.
Raoul went crazy on them kids.

22:15.876 --> 22:19.004
There's over a million dollars in that house.
Why didn't that lady tell us where it was at?

22:19.079 --> 22:23.038
- Where'd you find a number like that?
- You hear it on the street.

22:23.116 --> 22:27.576
Chantal knew. Everybody know
them Runnels people is rich.

22:27.654 --> 22:30.088
So Raoul just got pissed off...

22:30.157 --> 22:32.625
and shot those kids?

22:37.564 --> 22:41.330
Yeah.

22:41.401 --> 22:45.428
First, he was just bluffin'.
But she didn't go for it.

22:45.505 --> 22:50.340
Then he just started yellin' and screamin'.

22:50.410 --> 22:52.435
And then it seemed
like he just lost it.

22:55.315 --> 22:58.250
Where are we gonna find Raoul and Chantal?

23:01.888 --> 23:05.255
Where are we gonna find
Raoul and Chantal?

23:05.325 --> 23:08.954
I guess somewhere
in Brooklyn someplace.

23:12.599 --> 23:14.829
I told Raoul to get rid of the guns...

23:14.901 --> 23:18.769
and he said he'd probably throw 'em off
the bridge once they got over to Brooklyn.

23:18.839 --> 23:22.605
What bridge?
Manhattan Bridge?

23:22.676 --> 23:24.268
- Yeah.
- Hmm?

23:24.344 --> 23:26.904
- Yeah.
- How were they gonna get over there?

23:26.980 --> 23:30.040
Some girl.
I don't know who she is.

23:30.116 --> 23:32.949
Ricky know her.

23:33.019 --> 23:35.579
Write it up like you told me.

23:39.726 --> 23:44.686
Man, I had me a good future.

23:52.405 --> 23:54.430
- Did you hear him?
- Tail end, yep.

23:54.508 --> 23:56.442
I guess we oughta look for those guns.

23:56.510 --> 23:58.444
MaybeJames and Greg can look.

23:58.512 --> 24:01.675
My guy gave up the driver that
took Chantal and Raoul someplace.

24:01.748 --> 24:06.651
Got the block she lives on. There's a poster
of Snoop Doggy Dogg in the window.

24:06.720 --> 24:08.984
You have some messages, Detective.

24:09.055 --> 24:12.616
James, Greg, take a ride with us?
Give us a hand on something?

24:12.692 --> 24:15.957
- Yeah, sure.
- I got a guy in 1 I'm gonna send somebody to take care of.

24:16.029 --> 24:17.758
- Okay, Detective.
- Who's Snoopy Dog?

24:17.831 --> 24:20.459
Some big rap singer
who took a collar for murder.

24:20.534 --> 24:23.128
Probably posters in every building.

24:31.077 --> 24:33.011
Look at this mess!

24:33.079 --> 24:35.707
Yeah. But what a beautiful city, huh?

24:35.782 --> 24:39.183
- Hey, James, let's check into this motel over here.
- All right.

24:39.252 --> 24:42.744
- When you finish over there, head in that direction.
- Okay.

24:44.224 --> 24:46.317
Ever see the size of the rats down here?

24:46.393 --> 24:48.793
- You had to bring it up, didn't you?
- Big ones.

24:50.764 --> 24:54.131
- Ever try this Night Train?
- No.

24:54.200 --> 24:57.465
- It's pretty popular.
- Yeah? I'll get you a bottle for your birthday.

24:57.537 --> 24:59.903
Hey! Get out ofhere!
Get the hell out ofhere!

24:59.973 --> 25:01.838
- Hey, take it easy.
- I live here!

25:01.908 --> 25:04.809
- Get the hell out ofhere, or I'll call the cops!
- We are the cops.

25:04.878 --> 25:08.143
You ain't cops. You're probably dumpin'
your dead girlfriend or gun or somethin'.

25:08.214 --> 25:12.480
Yeah? What do you know about a gun?
Did you find a gun?

25:12.552 --> 25:14.486
If you found a gun, you better tell us.

25:14.554 --> 25:16.351
- I don't have to tell you nothin'.
- Get out of there.

25:16.423 --> 25:18.391
- You got a gun?
- I ain't got no gun!

25:18.458 --> 25:20.688
- Is this your stuff? Huh?
- Yeah.

25:20.760 --> 25:23.160
- Why were you talkin' about a gun?
- I don't have no gun.

25:23.229 --> 25:26.494
- I never said I had one.
- All right, everybody up! Let's go!

25:26.566 --> 25:29.330
- We don't have no guns, okay?
- Pull that stuff out of there.

25:29.402 --> 25:32.064
- Shake it out. Come on. Let's go.
- Why y'all out here bothering us?

25:32.138 --> 25:35.574
- All the guns is out in the street!
- Detective!

25:35.642 --> 25:38.338
Got one over here.

25:46.252 --> 25:48.186
Good one.

25:51.791 --> 25:53.725
I'll run it for Fancy.

25:53.793 --> 25:56.591
Yeah. Sit down.

25:56.663 --> 25:58.824
- Am I under arrest?
- No, not yet, Denise.

25:58.898 --> 26:02.994
- Then who are you telling me to sit down?
- Sit down, Denise!

26:05.171 --> 26:10.006
- Diane, do me a favor and watch her for a second.
- Yeah.

26:12.846 --> 26:15.747
- What are you lookin' at?
- Nothin'.

26:15.815 --> 26:18.010
Oh, you're lookin' at somethin'
if you're lookin' at me.

26:19.285 --> 26:21.583
That's the girl that drove
the husband and wife?

26:21.655 --> 26:25.056
She wasn't at the crime scene. She picked
them up at a burgerjoint afterwards.

26:25.125 --> 26:27.059
We're lookin' for where
she dropped them.

26:27.127 --> 26:29.823
Well, James and Greg found one of the guns.
It's a.38.

26:29.896 --> 26:31.955
Yeah? Good.

26:33.633 --> 26:36.727
That sounds like Sylvia.

26:36.803 --> 26:40.534
She just came in
through the hallway door.

26:40.607 --> 26:43.974
- Can you start with Denise?
- Yeah, I got it.

26:44.044 --> 26:46.569
- Is that a wig?
- What?

26:48.982 --> 26:51.450
No, it's not a wig.

26:51.518 --> 26:53.611
That's your real hair?

26:53.687 --> 26:57.145
- You put a lot of bleach on it, don't you?
- Hey, come on.

26:57.223 --> 26:59.453
We're gonna talk.

26:59.526 --> 27:02.120
- Right back there.
- Don't be pushin' on me!

27:07.167 --> 27:10.295
- Andy, I'm in here.
- I'm just comin' to say hello.

27:10.370 --> 27:14.136
- What are you up here for?
- Ricky Watson and Arthur Cartwell.

27:14.207 --> 27:17.108
Uh-uh. No good.

27:17.177 --> 27:19.771
- What do you mean, no good"?
- I don't want you takin' those statements.

27:19.846 --> 27:22.906
I don't want you bargin' in here
and telling me what I can and can't do.

27:22.982 --> 27:25.780
You shouldn't be workin' anyway, Sylvia.
You should be home resting.

27:25.852 --> 27:28.787
- They can get somebody else to take those statements.
- I'm not going home.

27:28.855 --> 27:33.258
This could last for months. I'm not gonna
quit doing my job just 'cause I'm pregnant.

27:33.326 --> 27:35.988
You're sick. You're in no shape to work.
Now, go home. I'm telling you.

27:36.062 --> 27:38.826
- Stop yelling at me.
- I'm tryin'to look out for you. You're sick.

27:38.898 --> 27:41.799
Now, I want you to go home.
I don't want you listenin' to this crap.

27:41.868 --> 27:47.204
I am not going home! I am gonna do my work,
and I don't want you to interfere!

27:52.579 --> 27:55.810
You know a Chantal and Raoul, Denise?

27:57.751 --> 27:59.912
Sure, I know 'em.

27:59.986 --> 28:04.116
- When'd you see 'em last?
- Three days ago.

28:04.190 --> 28:07.557
Well, Denise, we know for a fact
that you're a liar.

28:07.627 --> 28:11.393
We know that you picked them and
Ricky and Arthur up at some burger joint.

28:11.464 --> 28:13.227
We know they divided the money
up in your car...

28:13.299 --> 28:16.166
and we know they gave you
a grand to take 'em someplace.

28:16.236 --> 28:19.205
- You got me mixed up with somebody else.
- Hey, Denise.

28:19.272 --> 28:21.866
There were two kids that were murdered
in that robbery, and you were the driver.

28:21.941 --> 28:24.535
Now, hold it.
I wasn't no driver like that.

28:28.581 --> 28:33.416
Chantal called me and asked me
for a ride.

28:33.486 --> 28:35.545
Somebody wanna give me money,
I'm gonna take it.

28:35.622 --> 28:38.750
I don't know where the money came from.
I be a fool I don't take the money.

28:38.825 --> 28:40.759
Well, you know,
you are either gonna walk out of here...

28:40.827 --> 28:43.523
or I'm gonna lock you up
as an accessory to murder.

28:43.596 --> 28:46.929
- So it's up to you.
- I gotta take care of my daughter.

28:47.000 --> 28:50.401
So where is Raoul and Chantal?
Where did you take them?

28:56.476 --> 28:59.502
Some friend of Raoul's...

28:59.579 --> 29:01.843
out in Brooklyn by the navy yard.

29:01.915 --> 29:04.907
But he didn't let 'em stay there, though.
He was scared.

29:04.984 --> 29:07.452
- He sent 'em down the street to some empty building.
- You can point it out?

29:07.520 --> 29:11.616
- I gotta go in there?
- No. All you gotta do is point it out.

29:12.792 --> 29:16.592
Yeah, I can point it out.

29:52.532 --> 29:56.901
- Police! Raoul, come on out!
- Raoul, we got cops all around here!

29:56.970 --> 29:59.734
Now, get your stinkin'ass
out here with your hands up!

29:59.806 --> 30:02.331
- I'm afraid to!
- What are you afraid of?

30:02.408 --> 30:04.501
- You afraid we'll pump a round in the back of your head?
- Andy, cut it out!

30:04.577 --> 30:07.341
- How do I know that you won't?
- We won't do that!

30:07.413 --> 30:09.813
- Give you my word!
- Your word?

30:09.883 --> 30:11.976
- Big deal!
- Raoul, you got a gun in there?

30:12.051 --> 30:14.815
- No!
- Chantal in there? She got a gun?

30:14.888 --> 30:17.288
- Don't have any guns!
- All right, all right. Just calm down.

30:17.357 --> 30:21.817
Unlock the door,
and just stand back and stand still.

30:21.895 --> 30:24.363
Nobody'll shoot you.
Just stay still, okay?

30:24.430 --> 30:26.364
- You listening to me?
- Yeah!

30:26.432 --> 30:28.423
I'm opening the door now!

30:30.870 --> 30:32.929
All right, turn around!
Get your hands up!

30:37.277 --> 30:40.769
- Where's Chantal?
- She's not here. She didn't have anything to do with it.

30:40.847 --> 30:44.510
Where's the money? Huh?
Where'd you put the money?

30:44.584 --> 30:47.052
Get off this!

30:47.120 --> 30:49.281
I want you to listen to me, Raoul.

30:49.355 --> 30:51.823
- Listen to me! Where is Chantal?
- I don't know.

30:51.891 --> 30:54.519
You don't know?
Want us to bring her in dead?

30:54.594 --> 30:57.392
- No.
- Well, that's what's gonna happen. Where is she?

30:57.463 --> 31:00.023
- She's-She's coming back here.
- Oh, son of a bitch.

31:00.099 --> 31:02.260
You son of a bitch!

31:02.335 --> 31:04.963
Then we're gonna have to wait here
until she comes back here, huh?

31:05.038 --> 31:07.666
There's half a chance
she made us coming in!

31:07.740 --> 31:12.006
We have to get him in a car and take him over
to the house. Then we have to set up here.

31:12.078 --> 31:15.013
I'm gonna have to stay here
instead of being home with my wife!

31:16.182 --> 31:18.173
- How much money does she have?
- Not much.

31:18.251 --> 31:20.082
She just went out to get us food.

31:20.153 --> 31:23.247
- I didn't want her getting mugged.
- Oh, yeah.

31:23.323 --> 31:26.759
The streets today, Raoul-
You're absolutely right.

31:26.826 --> 31:29.454
Let's clear the uniforms and get set up.

31:39.806 --> 31:42.001
Good morning, Sarge.

31:42.075 --> 31:44.373
- How's it goin'?
- Good.

31:47.447 --> 31:49.381
Lesbo.

31:49.449 --> 31:51.576
- Lesniak?
- Big-time.

31:51.651 --> 31:53.585
Whoa!

32:01.794 --> 32:04.126
- You find Chantal?
- No, we didn't.

32:04.197 --> 32:06.131
Get out of there.

32:06.199 --> 32:10.431
- We sat in that manure heap all night.
- She must've seen somethin'.

32:10.503 --> 32:14.599
- She's smart- Chantal.
- Smart enough to let you take the fall.

32:14.674 --> 32:17.768
You know, Raoul, they're gonna
love your hair in thejoint, man.

32:17.844 --> 32:21.280
It didn't come out so good.
I just did it for a disguise.

32:21.347 --> 32:24.316
So you could blend in with the crowd?

32:24.384 --> 32:27.751
What's this? A newjacket?

32:27.820 --> 32:30.084
Yeah, I needed some new c...

32:30.156 --> 32:31.783
clothes for the trip.

32:31.858 --> 32:35.089
- Where you goin'?
- Anyplace.

32:35.161 --> 32:36.924
Maybe Puerto Rico.

32:36.996 --> 32:39.794
Why didn't you go?
You had the money.

32:39.866 --> 32:43.529
I couldn't have done it
with the cops watchin' the airports.

32:43.603 --> 32:48.836
I hate to tell you this, Einstein,
but we ain't got that kind of manpower.

32:48.908 --> 32:53.436
- I would never have gotten out of the airport.
- Hey, Raoul.

32:53.513 --> 32:55.606
- Where's Chantal?
- I don't know.

32:55.681 --> 32:58.775
What do you want with her anyway?
She didn't have anything to do with this.

32:58.851 --> 33:01.684
All right, you knock off the stupid lies!
All right?

33:01.754 --> 33:04.382
Don't be thinkin' that
we're as dumb as you are!

33:04.457 --> 33:07.221
Hey, I made some mistakes, all right...

33:07.293 --> 33:09.523
but that does not mean that I am dumb.

33:09.595 --> 33:14.931
You are either the evilest
son of a bitch around or the dumbest...

33:15.001 --> 33:19.131
to rob and murder people
who live right next door to you.

33:19.205 --> 33:21.696
Well, what are you gonna do?

33:21.774 --> 33:24.641
For a million dollars,
you take some chances!

33:24.710 --> 33:28.305
Anyway, I didn't murder nobody!

33:28.381 --> 33:30.372
Those kids' mother lived!

33:30.450 --> 33:32.748
We got her and Arthur saying...

33:32.819 --> 33:35.379
that you pulled the trigger
on those children!

33:37.156 --> 33:39.852
I didn't really do it.

33:39.926 --> 33:43.987
I mean, it seemed like it was
the woman's fault, her being such a liar.

33:44.063 --> 33:46.657
How did she lie?

33:46.732 --> 33:48.825
Saying that she doesn't know
where all the money is.

33:48.901 --> 33:51.165
I mean,
she don't care about the kids.

33:51.237 --> 33:53.171
All she cares about's the money.

33:53.239 --> 33:57.073
Why don't she say where the money is?

33:57.143 --> 34:01.546
- So you got pissed off and you shot the kids?
- No!

34:01.614 --> 34:06.051
I was fakin', okay?
I was just tryin'to scare her.

34:06.119 --> 34:08.053
And then something
went wrong in there.

34:08.121 --> 34:13.024
It seemed like the gun went off by itself.
It was a freak accident.

34:13.092 --> 34:16.289
A freak accident?
Killing both those kids?

34:16.362 --> 34:19.092
Yeah.

34:19.165 --> 34:21.463
You are the freak accident!

34:21.534 --> 34:25.094
Those kids didn't mean no more to you
than a couple of cockroaches!

34:25.170 --> 34:28.106
Maybe being alive
don't even mean anything to you!

34:28.174 --> 34:30.039
L- I don't know!

34:30.109 --> 34:32.235
I mean, it just got crazy!

34:32.311 --> 34:35.542
It wasn't supposed to happen like this!

34:35.614 --> 34:40.449
All I wanted to do was just buy
some nice things for my wife!

34:40.520 --> 34:45.480
- We got Sister Cecilia.
- All right. Can you put her in 2?

34:45.558 --> 34:47.788
And she says if Andy comes in,
she's not talking to anybody.

34:47.860 --> 34:50.623
Yeah. All right.

34:54.667 --> 34:56.658
Go ahead.

35:06.245 --> 35:08.713
- I won't talk to the other one.
- Yeah, all right, Sister.

35:08.781 --> 35:11.113
Come into my house and insult me.

35:13.119 --> 35:16.452
- Can I get you something here?
- No.

35:16.522 --> 35:20.356
I tell you, he, uh-
he's upset about those kids.

35:20.426 --> 35:23.054
Insults my faith!

35:25.064 --> 35:26.998
Have you spoken to Chantal?

35:27.066 --> 35:30.627
- No.
- We busted Raoul.

35:33.105 --> 35:35.596
He shot those kids.
He just admitted it.

35:35.675 --> 35:38.701
- Maybe you make him say something.
- Mm-mmm. No, Sister.

35:38.778 --> 35:41.713
He had $ 18,000 with him that
he stole from the Runnels's apartment.

35:41.781 --> 35:46.184
We got the other two guys who were
with him, we got Denise Ludlow...

35:46.252 --> 35:48.160
and they all say
your daughter was there.

35:52.464 --> 35:55.695
She say it a frame-up
'cause Raoul got a record.

35:59.104 --> 36:02.505
- When did you talk to her?
- She phoned this morning.

36:02.574 --> 36:06.305
She want me to bring her money.

36:06.378 --> 36:09.279
- She want to leave town.
- Where was she?

36:09.348 --> 36:11.282
Some hotel uptown.

36:11.350 --> 36:13.511
What'd you tell her?

36:15.087 --> 36:19.854
I told her none of this sound right,
and I feel sick...

36:19.925 --> 36:23.691
like I know Chantal
was in that house.

36:23.762 --> 36:26.287
Soon as that happen over there,
how come they never come back home?

36:26.365 --> 36:29.129
She say the hotel she was staying at?

36:29.201 --> 36:34.901
No. She just yell at me and hang up.

36:39.845 --> 36:43.781
Sister, I know how much
you love your daughter...

36:43.849 --> 36:45.646
and I know how sad you feel.

36:45.717 --> 36:48.550
Knowing what kind of person you are,
when your daughter asks for help...

36:48.620 --> 36:51.987
it's very hard for me to believe
that you would say no.

36:58.864 --> 37:03.267
Chantal's mind always full of envy.

37:04.503 --> 37:07.301
She always want everything.

37:07.372 --> 37:11.468
She see something on the TV,
she want it.

37:11.543 --> 37:14.910
She don't want to give.

37:14.980 --> 37:17.778
She just want to get.

37:17.850 --> 37:22.446
There comes a time when
you have to give something up.

37:22.521 --> 37:26.082
Or maybe someday,
something come and take away...

37:26.158 --> 37:28.626
everything you got.

37:31.897 --> 37:35.594
Did you say you would bring her money?

37:35.667 --> 37:38.431
I told her I'd go to the bank for her.

37:38.503 --> 37:42.200
She's coming back home
to get this money?

37:42.274 --> 37:45.675
She's afraid.

37:45.744 --> 37:49.874
- She's in the store.
- What store?

37:49.948 --> 37:51.939
Where I'm supposed to meet her.

37:52.017 --> 37:56.647
I'm leaving to go there when
the policewoman come to got me.

37:56.722 --> 37:59.657
All right.

38:19.878 --> 38:22.813
- Excuse me. Where's the cosmetics?
- It's the next department over.

38:22.881 --> 38:25.111
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

38:35.027 --> 38:37.587
You see her?

38:37.663 --> 38:39.688
- Yeah.
- Where is she?

38:39.765 --> 38:43.667
- Sittin' in the chair gettin' her face done.
- Wait here.

38:47.272 --> 38:49.365
- What's goin' on?
- No! I wasn't there!

38:49.441 --> 38:51.432
- I wasn't there! I wasn't there!
- Put your hand behind your back.

38:51.510 --> 38:55.276
Mama? Mama, how can you do this?

38:55.347 --> 38:58.043
I wasn't there.
I was with you.

38:58.116 --> 39:01.574
- No, you wasn't.
- You dirty, voodoo bitch!

39:01.653 --> 39:03.917
- Hey, shut up!
- Why you doin' this to me!

39:03.989 --> 39:05.957
Don't you curse at me!

39:06.024 --> 39:08.754
Settle down. Hey!

39:08.827 --> 39:10.795
- You're a Iying pig!
- Stop it now!

39:10.862 --> 39:14.195
- That's your mother! Now, stop that!
- I hope you die, Mama!

39:14.266 --> 39:16.200
Take her out of here! I got this...

39:16.268 --> 39:18.759
- Take her out.
- Okay, take it easy.

39:18.837 --> 39:22.398
Take it easy.

39:25.610 --> 39:29.011
- Just take it easy.
- She was my baby.

39:30.449 --> 39:34.715
I know. I know.

39:34.786 --> 39:36.777
Come on.

39:37.856 --> 39:40.086
Come on.

39:57.309 --> 40:01.268
- I've been out of line.
- What?

40:01.346 --> 40:05.646
- I've been out of line.
- Yeah.

40:05.717 --> 40:08.845
With Russell, uh...

40:08.920 --> 40:12.048
that was something I thought
I could help with.

40:12.124 --> 40:14.285
You know, I asked her.
She said she did try to talk to you.

40:14.359 --> 40:17.817
The next morning. She should've reached
out when she was reachin' for the drink.

40:17.896 --> 40:20.524
Well, we messed up.
That happens.

40:20.599 --> 40:22.590
Hey, I'm not lookin'
to beef with you, all right?

40:22.667 --> 40:25.636
I'm just sayin' I, uh-
I'm out of line.

40:30.308 --> 40:33.038
There's no helpin' anybody.

40:33.111 --> 40:37.912
Russell, Sylvia's so sick, these kids.

40:37.983 --> 40:40.451
- Sylvia's sick?
- Yeah.

40:40.519 --> 40:42.453
What's wrong?
What did her doctor say?

40:42.521 --> 40:44.546
- She won't go.
- You gotta make her go, Andy.

40:44.623 --> 40:47.251
She just stays in the bathroom
heavin' all the time.

40:47.325 --> 40:49.452
Everywhere she goes, she vomits.

40:49.528 --> 40:54.363
- That's how she's sick?
- Constantly throws up.

40:54.433 --> 40:56.765
Andy, that's gonna pass.

40:56.835 --> 40:59.360
I can't do anything for her.

41:01.273 --> 41:06.142
You hate being helpless.
Thank God she's gonna be all right.

41:06.211 --> 41:09.146
My first wife,
she didn't get sick like this.

41:13.018 --> 41:15.248
Unless I don't remember.

41:19.825 --> 41:22.521
Anyways...

41:24.629 --> 41:27.063
Anyways" is not good enough, Andy.

41:27.132 --> 41:29.726
- I saw those two dead kids too.
- How many times you want me to give it up?

41:29.801 --> 41:32.702
You go off like that,
I can't talk to my partner.

41:35.240 --> 41:37.902
I turned down those sheets too.

41:43.882 --> 41:48.581
I'll tell you somethin' else.
That girl and her mother, that screamin'...

41:48.653 --> 41:52.054
- The two of them oughta be candidates for a talk show.
- Well, maybe they'll get on now.

41:52.124 --> 41:57.061
Daughters that murder,
and mothers that give 'em up."

42:01.633 --> 42:04.067
Give me a minute, will you?

42:08.140 --> 42:10.904
I'll see you tomorrow.

42:10.976 --> 42:13.444
Yeah.

42:17.716 --> 42:20.378
Need help with fives?

42:20.452 --> 42:22.443
Boss said we didn't have
to get 'em in until tomorrow.

42:24.823 --> 42:26.882
On that drinkin'...

42:26.958 --> 42:29.222
I know I should've called you.

42:29.294 --> 42:31.785
Only point's gettin' sober.
Now, if you reached out to Bobby...

42:31.863 --> 42:33.797
not to think about that,
that's no good.

42:33.865 --> 42:37.357
Well, that's what I did, Andy.
I wanted to stop...

42:37.435 --> 42:39.801
and I didn't feel like
thinking about it till today.

42:41.840 --> 42:44.900
I just-just wanted to be held.

42:48.013 --> 42:50.880
Yeah, well, I guess
that's understandable.

42:54.219 --> 42:56.449
- You going to a meeting tonight?
- No.

42:56.521 --> 42:59.285
I'm concerned about Sylvia.
I'm gonna stay home.

42:59.357 --> 43:03.987
- I'll tell you what they say.
- Yeah, good.

43:08.433 --> 43:10.924
Find some time for him too.

43:25.016 --> 43:28.543
- Sylvia?
- Hey.

43:31.489 --> 43:35.585
Hey.

43:35.660 --> 43:37.992
How are you feelin'?

43:38.063 --> 43:41.226
I don't wanna put a hex on this,
but I feel pretty good.

43:41.299 --> 43:44.632
- Is that so?
- I didn't throw up this morning.

43:44.703 --> 43:48.639
I didn't throw up all day.

43:48.707 --> 43:50.641
Maybe I should stay out tonight too.

43:51.910 --> 43:53.844
It's got nothin' to do with you.

43:56.915 --> 44:00.442
Andy, you're not gonna be
yelling at me from now on, are you?

44:00.518 --> 44:03.248
No, I didn't mean to do that.
I just got so worried.

44:10.862 --> 44:14.628
I'm glad you're okay now.

44:14.699 --> 44:16.894
Join the club.

45:05.183 --> 45:08.914
- What are you doing?
- I'm just watching my birds.

45:11.156 --> 45:13.556
It must've been awful
seeing those kids dead.

45:15.360 --> 45:18.796
Yeah.

45:18.863 --> 45:21.388
I just wanna watch my birds
for a while, Diane.

45:22.305 --> 45:28.574
