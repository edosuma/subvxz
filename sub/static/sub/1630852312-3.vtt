WEBVTT

00:04.221 --> 00:07.224
- You have lost your damn mind.
- Nah, you tripping, bro.

00:07.268 --> 00:08.530
I'm not arguing
with you about this.

00:08.573 --> 00:09.922
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
What's up with you two?

00:09.966 --> 00:12.360
I asked Sherm, "What would
be scarier to fight,

00:12.403 --> 00:16.538
20 badgers or 1 bear?"
and this fool said 20 badgers.

00:16.581 --> 00:18.627
Yes, because
it's obvious, Wyatt.

00:18.670 --> 00:20.803
You can beat one animal,
but 20 little freaks?

00:20.846 --> 00:23.327
That's four paws each,
five claws per paw.

00:23.371 --> 00:25.025
That's 400 claws.
You are done for.

00:25.068 --> 00:26.243
But bears are huge.

00:26.287 --> 00:28.028
They're like 600 pounds
of pure muscle.

00:28.071 --> 00:29.855
You wouldn't stand a chance.

00:29.899 --> 00:32.380
I'm not scared of weight.
I'm scared of teamwork.

00:32.423 --> 00:34.686
20 little brains
all working together

00:34.730 --> 00:37.124
like a damn badger
wireless network.

00:37.167 --> 00:40.040
Are y'all still arguing
about this?

00:40.083 --> 00:41.563
A bear is way scarier, okay?

00:41.606 --> 00:43.130
They're the heavyweights
of the forest.

00:43.173 --> 00:44.435
It's like saying
you would rather fight

00:44.479 --> 00:45.828
Evander Holyfield
than 20 little kids.

00:45.871 --> 00:47.264
I would.
Kids scare the crap out of me.

00:47.308 --> 00:49.092
They are ruthless.
"Lord of the Flies" much?

00:49.136 --> 00:50.398
Sherm's right.

00:50.441 --> 00:51.355
I once saw a five-year-old
pull the legs

00:51.399 --> 00:52.661
off a lizard while laughing.

00:52.704 --> 00:54.097
What are we even fighting
about now?

00:54.141 --> 00:55.838
all: Kids versus Holyfield.
- Keep up.

00:55.881 --> 00:57.535
Holyfield would crush
20 little kids.

00:57.579 --> 00:59.189
20 kids all day.
What are you talking about?

00:59.233 --> 01:00.364
<i>♪ Whoop, whoop</i>

01:00.408 --> 01:01.757

01:20.950 --> 01:23.083
It's not often we get graced
with the presence

01:23.126 --> 01:25.911
of Wyatt's other half.
Thanks for the drinks, you two.

01:25.955 --> 01:27.087
Don't thank me.

01:27.130 --> 01:29.132
Thank my high-powered,
sexy lawyer wife

01:29.176 --> 01:31.743
who can strong-arm
anyone in Hollywood.

01:31.787 --> 01:33.267
She's the one
that makes the money.

01:33.310 --> 01:34.398
Hey,
since you're an attorney,

01:34.442 --> 01:35.965
I gotta ask you
about this judge

01:36.008 --> 01:37.227
I went on a date with.

01:37.271 --> 01:39.447
You're dating a judge?
That is amazing.

01:39.490 --> 01:41.753
I suppose.
However, when we went out

01:41.797 --> 01:44.234
for coffee, she wore
her judge's robe.

01:44.278 --> 01:46.062
That's weird, ain't it?
- Eh.

01:46.106 --> 01:47.759
Maybe she was just
coming from work.

01:47.803 --> 01:49.109
It would be kind of
like if a doctor

01:49.152 --> 01:50.153
showed up wearing scrubs.

01:50.197 --> 01:51.328
Yeah, I've seen some judges

01:51.372 --> 01:53.069
in their robes
outside of the courthouse.

01:53.113 --> 01:54.201
I don't know.
I'm with Sherm.

01:54.244 --> 01:55.419
When I was dancing on Broadway,

01:55.463 --> 01:57.117
I wouldn't wear
my costume to a date.

01:57.160 --> 01:58.901
Wait, you were on Broadway?

01:58.944 --> 02:00.120
Mm-hmm.
Nothing crazy.

02:00.163 --> 02:01.686
Just "Wicked", "Color Purple."

02:01.730 --> 02:03.035
I was a giraffe
in "The Lion King."

02:03.079 --> 02:05.081
Yeah, I feel
like I've known you for so long

02:05.125 --> 02:06.604
that I forget that we just met.

02:06.648 --> 02:08.084
I don't know anything
about you.

02:08.128 --> 02:09.433
You pretty much
know everything.

02:09.477 --> 02:11.305
There's really not
that much more to learn.

02:11.348 --> 02:13.437
Anyway, can I get anybody
anything from the bar?

02:13.481 --> 02:15.526
We have a great merlot
from Argentina in.

02:15.570 --> 02:16.875
Wait, why did you
say it like that?

02:16.919 --> 02:19.443
Do you work here now?
- I do. I needed a job.

02:19.487 --> 02:21.924
Yup, there's nothing else
to learn about you.

02:21.967 --> 02:23.447
Great talk.

02:23.491 --> 02:26.972
What's good, y'all?
all: Okay.

02:27.016 --> 02:29.192
That's right, you're looking
at the newest vice president

02:29.236 --> 02:31.107
at Joseph & Phillips
Accounting...

02:31.151 --> 02:34.154
Incorporated!
[all cheering]

02:37.026 --> 02:38.680
That means King TUT
is in the building.

02:38.723 --> 02:41.204
I love King TUT.
- King TUT?

02:41.248 --> 02:42.684
Oh, it stands for
Turn Up Tony,

02:42.727 --> 02:44.468
his party persona from college.

02:44.512 --> 02:46.209
Whenever he aced an exam,
and now,

02:46.253 --> 02:48.951
whenever he gets a promotion,
he transforms into King TUT.

02:48.994 --> 02:50.735
And also because he gets
so drunk, he falls asleep

02:50.779 --> 02:52.389
with his arms
crossed like a mummy.

02:52.433 --> 02:53.695
I detect no lies.

02:53.738 --> 02:55.218
Y'all down to get it
in tonight?

02:55.262 --> 02:56.480
I'm definitely down
to get it in,

02:56.524 --> 02:58.090
but I actually
have to make a run first.

02:58.134 --> 02:59.614
I am getting my hair did.

02:59.657 --> 03:01.224
- Okay, okay.
- Yeah. Yeah.

03:01.268 --> 03:02.225
The self-care journey
continues,

03:02.269 --> 03:03.792
and I'm calling it self-hair.

03:03.835 --> 03:05.663
- Don't call it that.
- Okay, I won't call it that.

03:05.707 --> 03:06.621
I'm not gonna call it
self-hair,

03:06.664 --> 03:08.188
but you guys get the vibe.

03:08.231 --> 03:10.146
Peace.
- Peace.

03:10.190 --> 03:12.975
Yo, what's up with you, Fay?
Coming out with us tonight?

03:13.018 --> 03:14.759
Yeah, I just gotta do
some laundry first.

03:14.803 --> 03:17.022
All my clothes are a mess
from making cookies.

03:17.066 --> 03:18.241
I love baking.

03:18.285 --> 03:19.677
Huh, not
shocking new information,

03:19.721 --> 03:21.113
but new information
nonetheless.

03:21.157 --> 03:23.812
- My godfather is Famous Amos.
- Well, there it is.

03:23.855 --> 03:25.509
Well, ladies and gentlemen,
we have a quorum,

03:25.553 --> 03:28.251
which means that tonight
is a TUT party

03:28.295 --> 03:30.384
where the champagne flows
like the River Nile.

03:30.427 --> 03:34.431
[phones buzz]
- Oh. Oh, dang.

03:34.475 --> 03:35.650
There's a wildfire
in Griffith Park,

03:35.693 --> 03:37.217
and our place
is in the evacuation zone.

03:37.260 --> 03:39.393
- Yeah, mine too.
- Damn, so is the bar.

03:39.436 --> 03:41.264
Well, I guess the party
is postponed, y'all.

03:41.308 --> 03:42.396
Not necessarily.

03:42.439 --> 03:43.875
I know a place not in the zone

03:43.919 --> 03:46.356
where you all could spend
the night.

03:46.400 --> 03:48.445
Welcome to the
Wyattdorf Kristoria.

03:48.489 --> 03:49.968
Oh, this is gonna be lit.

03:50.012 --> 03:51.709
I'm talking about the vibes,
not the wildfire.

03:51.753 --> 03:53.929
Yeah, but should we be
worried about how frequent

03:53.972 --> 03:55.409
these fires are happening?

03:56.932 --> 03:58.063
I'm sure the scientists
are figuring it out.

03:58.107 --> 03:59.064
We're good.

03:59.108 --> 04:00.370
all: Yeah, man.

04:00.414 --> 04:02.503
Wyatt, I always forget
how dope your house is.

04:02.546 --> 04:05.245
This is a TUT hut.

04:05.288 --> 04:08.378
Oh. Oh, yeah.
Oh, that's nice.

04:08.422 --> 04:10.032
Yeah, I can definitely
pass out here.

04:10.075 --> 04:12.730
Man. It is so dope that
your wife is the breadwinner.

04:12.774 --> 04:14.036
I mean, I'm not trying
to settle down,

04:14.079 --> 04:16.256
but if I was,
that would be the move.

04:16.299 --> 04:17.692
Sure.

04:17.735 --> 04:20.303
My wife is the provider,
but we both have our roles.

04:20.347 --> 04:21.609
I take care of the house.

04:21.652 --> 04:24.002
And yeah, she may
bring home the bacon,

04:24.046 --> 04:25.613
but I'm the one who cooks it.

04:25.656 --> 04:27.005
And she may make the bread,

04:27.049 --> 04:28.920
but I'm the one
who makes the sandwiches.

04:28.964 --> 04:32.228
And she may buy the limes,
but I'm the one who makes--

04:32.272 --> 04:35.318
Margaritas anyone?
all: Oh, yes.

04:35.362 --> 04:36.493
Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme.

04:36.537 --> 04:38.321
I thought he was gonna go on
forever.

04:40.018 --> 04:43.500
Ooh, this margarita
is too good.

04:43.544 --> 04:46.024
Kristen, how dare you?
- It's actually my recipe.

04:46.068 --> 04:47.722
No, I made some adjustments.

04:47.765 --> 04:50.028
A little Kristen kiss
of mezcal.

04:51.378 --> 04:54.119
Sorry, I'm late y'all.
What's happening?

04:54.163 --> 04:58.210
- Wow.
- Wow.

04:58.254 --> 05:00.300
So they didn't finish your hair
because of the fire?

05:00.343 --> 05:02.693
- No, this is what I asked for.
- It looks perfect.

05:02.737 --> 05:04.869
That is a TUT cut if I've
ever seen one.

05:04.913 --> 05:06.523
You look crazy.

05:06.567 --> 05:08.960
You know, Old Noah might've
taken this passive-aggression

05:09.004 --> 05:10.962
and dwelled on it,
but new Noah doesn't care.

05:11.006 --> 05:12.486
I've been reading
"The Three Pillars of Zen,"

05:12.529 --> 05:13.965
and I feel more relaxed
than my hair, baby.

05:14.009 --> 05:16.490
Well, can I get anyone
anything else?

05:16.533 --> 05:18.622
Coffee, tea, juice?

05:18.666 --> 05:22.322
Coffee, tea, juice?
How about shots, shots, shots?

05:22.365 --> 05:23.975
- Hey.
- Yes.

05:24.019 --> 05:25.934
Now, Kristen, we might need
to evacuate your house soon

05:25.977 --> 05:28.545
because you are on fire
with the hosting.

05:28.589 --> 05:33.158
[forced laughter]

05:33.202 --> 05:34.638
She's so great.

05:34.682 --> 05:37.162
Hey, babe, can I talk to you
for a second in the study?

05:37.206 --> 05:39.817
Sure.
[forced laughter]

05:39.861 --> 05:41.210
Hey, I know you have, like,

05:41.253 --> 05:43.081
a lot of work
that you probably have to do.

05:43.125 --> 05:45.127
You don't have to be doing
any hosting duties.

05:45.170 --> 05:46.650
Hosting is kind of my thing.

05:46.694 --> 05:48.783
So you're saying
I don't know how to host?

05:48.826 --> 05:51.394
No, I'm just saying that I've
been hosting since the womb.

05:51.438 --> 05:53.178
In fact, I left the womb
better than it was

05:53.222 --> 05:55.659
before I got in there.
The doctors were in awe.

05:55.703 --> 05:56.965
Okay, then,
well, if you think

05:57.008 --> 05:58.662
you're a better host,
why don't we find out?

05:58.706 --> 06:00.360
Let the houseguests decide.

06:00.403 --> 06:03.711
A hosting competition?
Okay.

06:05.190 --> 06:09.847
Okay, but I won't hold back.
I must break you.

06:09.891 --> 06:11.501
Bitch, I'm gonna crush you,
crumble you up,

06:11.545 --> 06:13.024
and then put you in a dish
as a garnish

06:13.068 --> 06:14.635
while I eat you alive.

06:14.678 --> 06:16.419
I'm gonna host so good
that it's gonna make you sick,

06:16.463 --> 06:17.855
and then I will nurse
you back to health

06:17.899 --> 06:19.509
because that's how dope
of a host I am.

06:19.553 --> 06:21.163
I'm gonna cut your head off
with a knife.

06:22.730 --> 06:24.340
My bad.
I got carried away.

06:24.384 --> 06:26.386
Don't apologize.
I loved it.

06:31.260 --> 06:34.002
As you know, we are elated
to have you all here today.

06:34.045 --> 06:35.873
So much so that we decided
to make hosting you guys

06:35.917 --> 06:38.136
a friendly competition
between lovers.

06:38.180 --> 06:39.355
Y'all are cute.

06:39.399 --> 06:40.878
Whoever loses has to do
that freaky thing

06:40.922 --> 06:42.053
that the other one
likes in the bedroom.

06:42.097 --> 06:43.228
We did not need
to know that part.

06:43.272 --> 06:44.708
Yes, you did.

06:44.752 --> 06:46.580
You need to know that
the stakes are high, sexually.

06:46.623 --> 06:48.320
Or low depending on who wins.

06:48.364 --> 06:49.713
You are nasty.

06:49.757 --> 06:50.888
- Oh, you're nasty.
- You're nasty.

06:50.932 --> 06:52.368
- No, you are nasty.
- You're nasty.

06:52.412 --> 06:54.979
- Aye, aye, aye. Too horny.
- Don't listen to him.

06:55.023 --> 06:58.113
We all get horny,
and sex is what made us.

06:58.156 --> 07:00.332
Sex is life,
and life is beautiful.

07:00.376 --> 07:03.031
Thank you, Long Hair Noah.
First up is dinner.

07:03.074 --> 07:05.947
And at the Wyatt Hyatt,
we would like to bring you

07:05.990 --> 07:10.255
Ye Rustic Inn, wings, nachos,
and a veggie deluxe burger

07:10.299 --> 07:13.171
for Anthony's
plant-based needs. My treat.

07:13.215 --> 07:14.434
Thank you. Dope.

07:14.477 --> 07:16.697
Or you can head over
to the Ritz-Kristen

07:16.740 --> 07:19.700
and try this new spot
off Hillhurst called Nossa.

07:19.743 --> 07:22.093
Hmm, what's that Nossa
talking about?

07:22.137 --> 07:24.008
They talking about plantains.
all: Ooh.

07:24.052 --> 07:26.663
They talking about sangria.
all: Aye.

07:26.707 --> 07:28.099
They talking about
all the flavors of Brazil.

07:28.143 --> 07:29.405
all: Yo!

07:29.449 --> 07:30.537
Now that is
the better choice.

07:30.580 --> 07:31.973
It's all good.

07:32.016 --> 07:33.583
You know, hosting
is a marathon, not a sprint.

07:33.627 --> 07:35.324
Is there anything else
I can do for anyone?

07:35.367 --> 07:37.282
