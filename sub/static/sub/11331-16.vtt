00:00.188 --> 00:03.113
Previously on The Secret Life
of the American Teenager...

00:03.128 --> 00:05.459
- Is something going on?
- You lied about being Robie's father?

00:05.459 --> 00:06.518
I had to lie.

00:06.638 --> 00:09.690
Just forget the wedding. You're
already married, so it's redundant

00:09.690 --> 00:12.106
and I don't feel like doing anything
that involves your father right now.

00:12.138 --> 00:16.580
And we feel betrayed because you didn't
tell us that you live like royalty.

00:16.767 --> 00:19.309
Physically, mentally,
spiritually. I'm fine.

00:19.325 --> 00:20.240
No, you're not.

00:20.287 --> 00:21.554
I'm in a meeting.

00:21.601 --> 00:23.493
Amy and Ricky aren't really married.

00:23.613 --> 00:25.660
Ben and Amy got into the
same school in New York.

00:25.701 --> 00:28.257
Amy can go to school in New York
if that's what she wants to do.

00:28.296 --> 00:29.438
And so Amy is probably relieved

00:29.453 --> 00:32.240
because now she gets to go
to school in New York with Ben

00:32.292 --> 00:34.724
and Ricky can stay here with you.

00:37.813 --> 00:39.347
What do you feel like now?

00:39.353 --> 00:40.792
I'm scared that he'll show up

00:40.808 --> 00:42.755
and take whatever happiness I have.

00:42.771 --> 00:44.312
And I'm not so in love anymore.

00:44.335 --> 00:47.323
No! You cannot break up with Anne!

00:47.375 --> 00:48.556
Not now. You can't!

00:48.676 --> 00:50.989
Amy and I aren't really married.

00:51.812 --> 00:53.453
You and I are getting evicted.

00:53.461 --> 00:56.385
And nothing you do with Kathleen
is going to make that go away.

00:57.685 --> 00:59.252
I need a miracle.

01:01.589 --> 01:03.556
I've always wanted you.

01:05.019 --> 01:07.788
I wish you'd told me before
I asked Amy to marry me.

01:07.908 --> 01:10.761
I couldn't tell you, I
didn't know where you were.

01:11.245 --> 01:13.654
It took me years to find you again.

01:14.194 --> 01:17.291
Please, please don't get married.

01:22.732 --> 01:24.540
We shouldn't be doing this.

01:24.564 --> 01:27.027
I know, I know we shouldn't, I'm sorry.

01:27.043 --> 01:29.162
But I just had to know what it
would be like to be with you.

01:29.178 --> 01:32.243
And you're not married, not yet.

01:32.564 --> 01:35.504
Please, please don't get married.

01:35.520 --> 01:38.054
Married or not, this is
wrong, this is really wrong,

01:38.077 --> 01:40.394
I've never cheated on Amy, never.

01:40.416 --> 01:41.793
And I never wanted to.

01:42.043 --> 01:44.116
Then again...

01:46.823 --> 01:49.590
Look, we have to stop,
she's going to be home soon.

01:49.645 --> 01:51.076
Why did you have to do it?

01:51.264 --> 01:52.460
Why did you have to get her pregnant?

01:52.492 --> 01:54.142
It was supposed to be you and me.

01:54.262 --> 01:56.394
You and me, Ricky. You and me.

01:56.394 --> 01:58.427
Yeah, but it wasn't.

01:58.443 --> 02:00.548
It was me. It was Ricky and me.

02:01.009 --> 02:04.098
We have a child together so
we have to be with each other.

02:04.674 --> 02:06.475
We don't have any choice.

02:07.289 --> 02:10.440
I got this as a special prize

02:10.495 --> 02:14.194
for getting pregnant and having a baby,

02:14.429 --> 02:18.589
and getting engaged and
getting married in high school.

02:19.536 --> 02:22.281
It goes with everything. Doesn't it, Ricky?

02:22.586 --> 02:25.151
Ricky? Ricky!

02:25.271 --> 02:26.828
Huh?

02:26.863 --> 02:28.842
You better get up if you're
going to meet with Leo.

02:29.296 --> 02:31.165
Oh. Yeah.

02:31.462 --> 02:33.362
Thanks.

02:58.492 --> 03:00.801
So I have to go by a copy of my transcript

03:00.832 --> 03:02.877
and then I'm coming back by here

03:02.899 --> 03:05.130
and my mom and I are leaving,

03:05.250 --> 03:07.513
and you'll be here alone, so...

03:07.633 --> 03:08.804
I could go with you.

03:08.838 --> 03:10.936
- Or you could go home.
- No, I'd rather go with you.

03:10.986 --> 03:12.762
Jack, you can't go with
me, you have school,

03:12.809 --> 03:15.009
and this is something I
just have to do with my mom.

03:15.047 --> 03:16.336
I could go with you and your mom.

03:16.342 --> 03:17.849
It would be like, what, a couple of days?

03:17.874 --> 03:19.163
I've missed a couple of days before.

03:19.194 --> 03:21.503
Jack, you missed a semester before.

03:21.691 --> 03:23.355
You missed the entire fall semester,

03:23.374 --> 03:25.207
you cannot miss any more days of school.

03:25.232 --> 03:27.097
Look, I'm just going to
check out these two campuses,

03:27.104 --> 03:28.981
I'll be back in a week,

03:29.101 --> 03:29.831
and while I'm gone,

03:29.856 --> 03:31.871
your dad said they'd love to
have you stay in your old room.

03:31.883 --> 03:32.978
Nah, I'll just stay here.

03:33.003 --> 03:35.287
Is it because you think that guy
knows where your parents live?

03:35.324 --> 03:36.638
What guy?

03:36.758 --> 03:39.779
Maybe Tom and I can bunk out
here together, like old times.

03:39.835 --> 03:42.226
You could. But Tom was invited
to stay at George's house

03:42.219 --> 03:44.428
and I think he's kind of excited about it.

03:44.548 --> 03:47.343
He's already mapped out
the bus route to work. So...

03:48.000 --> 03:49.308
Maybe you'd sleep better at home,

03:49.608 --> 03:51.573
you know, in your old room,
with your parents nearby.

03:51.642 --> 03:53.312
I'm sure the guy doesn't
know where they live.

03:53.331 --> 03:55.227
I'm not even worried about that.

03:55.258 --> 03:56.440
I sleep, I'm sleeping.

03:56.447 --> 03:58.342
- Come on, Jack, you're not sleeping.
- Sure I am.

03:58.367 --> 04:00.151
Jack, I let you stay here another week

04:00.145 --> 04:03.417
because you promised me you'd go
see the doctor, the psychiatrist.

04:03.611 --> 04:04.912
Stop making such a big deal about it

04:04.950 --> 04:06.651
and go talk to Dr. Chan, okay?

04:06.771 --> 04:08.253
I know you don't you need some help,

04:08.278 --> 04:09.598
but you need some help.

04:09.623 --> 04:11.481
You can't get over what
happened to you alone!

04:11.525 --> 04:12.352
But I'm not alone.

04:12.364 --> 04:14.498
I got the Big Guy upstairs,
and that's all I need.

04:14.504 --> 04:15.230
I know.

04:15.273 --> 04:18.051
But the Big Guy gave you a
phone number to call for help,

04:18.039 --> 04:19.380
so get some help.

04:19.822 --> 04:21.286
Do it for me, okay?

04:21.406 --> 04:22.782
While I'm away?

04:23.257 --> 04:25.479
Just talk to Dr. Chan.

04:25.599 --> 04:27.449
Or you can call Lauren's dad.

04:27.569 --> 04:29.019
You know him. You could talk to him.

04:29.013 --> 04:30.258
Talk about what?

04:30.378 --> 04:32.786
I'm telling you, I sleep at
night. I sleep when you sleep.

04:32.854 --> 04:34.024
Come on, Jack.

04:34.144 --> 04:36.383
I don't know why you
have to go tour campuses.

04:36.383 --> 04:38.304
I don't want you to go
out of state for college.

04:38.316 --> 04:39.467
Well, I probably won't,

04:39.455 --> 04:42.589
but I got into these colleges
and I want to take a look at them.

04:42.952 --> 04:44.310
I have to do what's best for me.

04:44.316 --> 04:45.861
I wanna go to whatever college

04:45.855 --> 04:48.195
guarantees me getting
into a good medical school.

04:48.621 --> 04:50.009
It's for our future.

04:55.515 --> 04:57.248
And you have to go talk to someone, too,

04:57.266 --> 04:58.868
because that's also for our future.

04:58.874 --> 05:00.556
Would you just drop it, Grace!

05:00.607 --> 05:02.046
All right.

05:02.396 --> 05:04.905
Well, bye, Jack. I'll see you next week.

05:06.469 --> 05:08.564
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to yell at you.

05:08.684 --> 05:11.005
Maybe it's a good idea time apart.

05:11.125 --> 05:14.403
But not too much time, because I really
don't want you going away for school.

05:14.685 --> 05:15.942
Unless I go with you.

05:15.973 --> 05:19.641
That's a possibility. But what's
best for you is to talk to somebody.

05:19.671 --> 05:22.291
Get some rest, move
back into your dorm room,

05:22.360 --> 05:23.649
and just move on with your life

05:23.665 --> 05:25.620
and not let what happened
to you hold you back.

05:26.201 --> 05:27.452
Bye, Jack.

05:41.799 --> 05:43.839
Wow. Court hearing?

05:44.546 --> 05:45.966
You're suing Anne?

05:46.086 --> 05:47.937
- No.
- She's suing you?

05:48.550 --> 05:49.051
No.

05:49.070 --> 05:51.529
Oh, Robie's dad is suing you? With Anne?

05:51.572 --> 05:53.105
- No.
- Mmm.

05:53.324 --> 05:55.158
She served you with an eviction notice?

05:55.183 --> 05:57.116
You're fighting that eviction notice?

05:57.799 --> 05:58.999
No.

05:59.250 --> 06:00.535
Somebody died?

06:01.439 --> 06:02.628
The dog is sick?

06:02.822 --> 06:04.148
None of the above.

06:04.186 --> 06:06.983
Suits are never good.
Why are you in a suit?

06:07.033 --> 06:09.917
Get used to it, sister. I
just reinvented myself again.

06:10.037 --> 06:11.612
Reinvented again.

06:11.647 --> 06:13.495
Re-invented. Again.

06:13.496 --> 06:15.517
- That's right.
- Isn't that redundant?

06:15.954 --> 06:17.487
No, I've never been here before.

06:17.531 --> 06:19.689
I've entered the world of the metrosexual.

06:19.733 --> 06:20.772
What do you think?

06:21.122 --> 06:23.506
I think I prefer the
world of the homosexual.

06:23.559 --> 06:24.457
I know what that is.

06:24.432 --> 06:25.933
I'll tell you what metrosexual is.

06:26.053 --> 06:28.111
I had a mani/pedi yesterday. Buff.

06:28.155 --> 06:30.620
That's kind of homosexual, in my opinion.

06:30.833 --> 06:33.880
Well, a metrosexual is pretty much
a straight homosexual, now isn't it?

06:34.000 --> 06:35.651
All right, I'll go with that.

06:35.771 --> 06:37.134
And I like the look.

06:37.415 --> 06:40.306
What are you going to do
with it, Mr. Metrosexual?

06:40.331 --> 06:41.325
I'll let you know.

06:41.325 --> 06:42.777
You want to meet me at Geoff's for dinner?

06:42.811 --> 06:44.035
For what?

06:44.654 --> 06:47.244
Oh, just tell me now. I
hate to go out to dinner.

06:47.269 --> 06:49.517
Then don't come, we'll
do it some other time.

06:49.885 --> 06:51.405
That's right. I've got a secret.

06:51.405 --> 06:54.414
And the only way you are going to get
in on it is if you come to Geoff's.

06:54.477 --> 06:56.516
- You got a secret,
huh?- Mmm-hmm.

06:56.547 --> 06:59.344
Aren't we pretty much waiting
on an eviction notice from Anne

06:59.350 --> 07:00.895
because of your secrets?

07:00.939 --> 07:04.105
Haven't you learned anything here
lately about not keeping secrets?

07:04.124 --> 07:05.669
Yeah, I've learned I'm too nice a guy

07:05.657 --> 07:07.483
just to sit around and take
whatever life throws at me

07:07.521 --> 07:09.654
without getting up and
taking some initiative.

07:09.705 --> 07:11.894
So you're doing what?

07:12.170 --> 07:13.365
Just tell me now.

07:13.427 --> 07:15.354
- I'll tell you tonight at Geoff's.
- Oh.

07:15.577 --> 07:17.801
Oh! You and Kathleen,
you're tying the knot?

07:17.845 --> 07:19.910
We've been tying the knot
but we're not getting married,

07:19.891 --> 07:21.630
not right now, if that's what you meant.

07:21.750 --> 07:23.618
Yeah, that's what I
meant, what did you mean?

07:23.652 --> 07:26.361
I mean, I've been
shaved, waxed and plucked.

07:26.380 --> 07:28.883
And I am ready to take on
the world all shiny and new.

07:29.003 --> 07:30.972
So you're saying you're
a male prostitute now?

07:31.041 --> 07:33.112
Don't they wish?

07:33.149 --> 07:34.300
"They" who?

07:34.420 --> 07:35.544
The ladies.

07:35.551 --> 07:36.778
I got to run.

07:36.898 --> 07:38.736
♪ Got the world on a string ♪

07:39.524 --> 07:42.096
♪ Sittin' on a rainbow ♪

07:42.216 --> 07:45.074
You're not going to be sitting
so pretty when we're homeless!

07:48.771 --> 07:49.785
Hello.

07:49.810 --> 07:51.580
Hey. I need a favor.

07:51.580 --> 07:53.320
I need to meet with Leo this morning.

07:53.715 --> 07:55.678
May I ask what this is regarding?

07:55.709 --> 07:57.943
No, you may not. Can you get me in or not?

07:57.968 --> 07:59.995
I have to know what it's regarding.

08:00.020 --> 08:02.416
Not everyone can get in to see the wizard.

08:02.453 --> 08:04.239
I know that. That's why
I said it was a favor.

08:04.305 --> 08:08.034
I can't do you a favor
at work. He's my boss.

08:08.154 --> 08:10.380
- He's everyone's boss.
- Sorry.

08:10.443 --> 08:12.151
I'll be by at 9:00 a.m.

08:13.735 --> 08:15.705
Are you going to go by and see Leo or not?

08:15.736 --> 08:16.793
I'm going to try to see Leo.

08:16.793 --> 08:18.395
I want to tell him we
lied about being married

08:18.420 --> 08:19.659
before someone else tells him.

08:19.690 --> 08:21.567
I don't want him to think
we've stolen his cash.

08:21.567 --> 08:22.512
I don't either.

08:22.537 --> 08:25.421
By the way, what happened to
Mimsy's money that she gave us?

08:25.541 --> 08:27.674
Us? That was not a wedding gift.

08:27.705 --> 08:29.751
- Wasn't it?
- Ashley got money, I got money.

08:29.871 --> 08:31.772
- Less money.
- Why did I think it was a "we"?

08:31.766 --> 08:32.847
We got money.

08:32.880 --> 08:33.756
I don't know.

08:33.768 --> 08:35.977
And I'm going to give those
gifts back to the nursery ladies.

08:36.033 --> 08:37.966
Why don't you just keep
those until we do get married

08:37.998 --> 08:40.294
so that this doesn't turn
into some kind of freak show?

08:40.299 --> 08:41.669
I can't keep that stuff.

08:41.676 --> 08:43.414
You can't keep it until we do get married?

08:43.697 --> 08:45.536
You're not keeping Leo's money.

08:45.549 --> 08:47.738
That's different. He's
practically like my father.

08:47.763 --> 08:49.637
And it's money. It's not a blender.

08:49.671 --> 08:51.624
Oh, no. We used that blender.

08:51.640 --> 08:53.113
Yeah. We used the salad spinner, too.

08:53.156 --> 08:55.034
I didn't. And neither of us touched

08:55.015 --> 08:57.474
the fondue pot, or the
crock pot, or the wok.

08:57.487 --> 08:59.833
But if you give those back, it'll
look as if we liked the blender

08:59.845 --> 09:01.153
but not the other stuff.

09:01.222 --> 09:02.860
Ugh! This is so complicated.

09:02.980 --> 09:04.068
Yeah.

09:04.188 --> 09:05.864
Oh, what a tangled web we weave...

09:05.984 --> 09:07.622
Finish it, smarty pants.

09:07.635 --> 09:09.624
I'm just saying we shouldn't have lied.

09:10.119 --> 09:12.209
But I don't know if we have
to tell everyone we lied

09:12.190 --> 09:13.522
unless we're not getting married again.

09:13.562 --> 09:16.238
You can stop saying that. It's
just "married." Not "married again."

09:16.275 --> 09:18.409
Uh, everyone is going to find out anyway,

09:18.428 --> 09:20.348
so do whatever you want,
tell whoever you want.

09:20.367 --> 09:21.349
It's over.

09:21.737 --> 09:23.326
It's over?

09:23.383 --> 09:24.621
The lie is over.

09:25.328 --> 09:26.830
Are we over?

09:26.849 --> 09:27.988
Why do you want to know?

09:28.108 --> 09:30.584
Got any plans to travel any time soon?

09:30.840 --> 09:33.912
You opened that invitation to tour
the school in New York, didn't you?

09:34.032 --> 09:37.071
Yeah, and I intend to open everything
that comes from that school.

09:37.191 --> 09:39.774
It's a federal offense to
open up someone else's mail.

09:39.793 --> 09:42.045
Have me arrested. Until you
start telling me the truth,

09:42.165 --> 09:44.560
I'm opening the mail that
comes from Hudson University.

09:44.626 --> 09:45.693
I'm not going, all right?

09:45.813 --> 09:47.032
You're not going to school there

09:47.013 --> 09:48.690
or you're not gonna go tour the campus?

09:48.810 --> 09:49.941
Why not?

09:49.973 --> 09:52.888
We're not married, Amy. We're
not even pretend married.

09:53.570 --> 09:55.203
And you know what? Give
me back that wedding ring.

09:55.272 --> 09:57.062
I want to give it back to my mother.

10:00.475 --> 10:01.516
Okay, forget it.

10:01.560 --> 10:03.887
I'll tell her we want to use
them for the next wedding.

10:05.258 --> 10:08.355
No, here, take it.

10:08.718 --> 10:10.484
No, you keep it, it's all right.

10:10.519 --> 10:11.921
Ricky, I want to get married.

10:11.934 --> 10:13.454
And you want to go to school in New York?

10:13.488 --> 10:14.931
Yeah, kind of.

10:16.244 --> 10:18.960
No. No, I don't. I do not want
to go to school in New York.

10:19.010 --> 10:21.093
But you want to go tour
the school in New York?

10:21.300 --> 10:22.683
Would it hurt?

10:22.696 --> 10:25.036
Oh, my God, Amy. Give me the ring. Give it.

10:26.137 --> 10:28.583
I'm trying. I can't get it off.

10:28.640 --> 10:31.255
I have to go if I'm going to
get in to see Leo before school.

10:31.286 --> 10:32.440
Then go.

10:37.405 --> 10:38.368
What?

10:39.144 --> 10:41.065
It's just that time is running out.

10:41.829 --> 10:43.668
I have to let the counselor know today

10:43.681 --> 10:46.421
if I'm going to go to
Hudson to tour the campus.

10:46.421 --> 10:48.454
Ricky, it doesn't mean that
I'm gonna go to school there.

10:48.490 --> 10:50.287
I just want to look around.

11:06.554 --> 11:07.718
Good morning.

11:08.044 --> 11:09.656
I wasn't expecting you.

11:10.083 --> 11:11.673
Did something happen to Nora?

11:11.793 --> 11:14.044
Uh, good morning. Did
something happen to Nora?

11:14.100 --> 11:16.340
Well, she's not here. She's always on time.

11:16.596 --> 11:17.773
What are you doing here?

11:17.829 --> 11:20.600
Oh, I wanted to return this to you.

11:20.635 --> 11:22.669
I thought you might bring that back.

11:23.123 --> 11:25.131
So for your honesty...

11:25.193 --> 11:27.978
- I can't.
- No. You can.

11:27.996 --> 11:30.425
You should. You're still going
to get married, aren't you?

11:30.824 --> 11:32.300
So you did hear already?

11:32.420 --> 11:34.822
Yeah, I heard already. So?

11:34.942 --> 11:36.111
Yeah, I think so.

11:37.118 --> 11:39.802
Oh? You think? You don't know?

11:40.121 --> 11:42.403
Undoing a lie could undo the relationship.

11:42.523 --> 11:44.181
I hope we're going to get married. I hope.

11:44.301 --> 11:45.923
- Keep the money.
- Ah...

11:45.992 --> 11:48.068
It was a wedding gift.
There was no wedding.

11:48.731 --> 11:49.632
Okay.

11:49.752 --> 11:52.103
I'll pay you to find out

11:53.123 --> 11:55.551
- what happened.
- I'll tell you for free.

11:58.335 --> 11:59.655
You chicken out at the last minute?

11:59.717 --> 12:01.538
We found some guy on the Internet

12:01.588 --> 12:03.095
and when we got to the place,

12:03.108 --> 12:04.409
he turned out to be some nut,

12:04.409 --> 12:08.483
so, yeah, we changed our minds
at the last minute and we ran.

12:08.603 --> 12:10.204
We didn't want that to be our wedding.

12:10.204 --> 12:12.225
We didn't want the guy to marry us.

12:12.575 --> 12:15.991
And everyone thought we
got married, so we lied.

12:16.111 --> 12:18.587
Okay, I'll take it.

12:19.188 --> 12:22.616
I'll put it aside and I'll give
it to you at your next wedding.

12:22.979 --> 12:25.082
No matter who you get married to.

12:25.082 --> 12:26.558
What's that supposed to mean?

12:26.678 --> 12:28.573
The only woman I want to marry is Amy.

12:28.642 --> 12:30.395
Okay. Is there

12:30.426 --> 12:32.672
some woman you want to be with?

12:33.761 --> 12:34.768
Like Clementine?

12:34.774 --> 12:36.532
How do you know about Clementine!

12:37.958 --> 12:39.034
Bunny?

12:39.154 --> 12:41.324
Rumors abound as to why
you're not really married.

12:41.343 --> 12:42.782
Clementine is just a friend.

12:42.782 --> 12:45.016
I've known her for years, or
I knew her years ago, anyway.

12:45.072 --> 12:46.292
All right.

12:46.336 --> 12:48.682
Camille was just a friend
for many years, you know.

12:48.876 --> 12:51.009
Where is Nora, do you think?

12:51.511 --> 12:52.793
Didn't mean to upset you.

12:52.812 --> 12:54.633
I'm not upset. I hate these stupid rumors.

12:54.664 --> 12:56.603
There are always rumors.

12:56.629 --> 12:57.917
And I should go find my mom.

12:57.924 --> 12:59.450
I'm sure she's on her way.

12:59.469 --> 13:01.333
And as far as the rumors go

13:01.453 --> 13:04.261
and people talking about you
and Amy, or you and anyone else,

13:04.273 --> 13:05.981
there's nothing you can do about it.

13:06.864 --> 13:07.846
Should we call her?

13:07.884 --> 13:09.260
Call her? Call Nora?

13:09.279 --> 13:10.837
You think I haven't called her?

13:10.893 --> 13:13.533
I don't like one minute
late, she's a half-hour late.

13:13.564 --> 13:16.392
She probably just got caught
up with George this morning.

13:16.586 --> 13:18.006
George?

13:20.209 --> 13:21.998
I didn't say you could see him!

13:22.217 --> 13:23.825
- Are you okay?
- No.

13:23.894 --> 13:25.783
I do not like to be late. I'm sorry.

13:25.827 --> 13:27.572
Everything all right at
the house? Is George okay?

13:27.628 --> 13:29.180
Yeah. Everything is fine. George is fine.

13:29.180 --> 13:31.026
I'm not fine. I'm late.

13:31.533 --> 13:33.051
Talk to you later.

13:33.585 --> 13:35.020
Okay.

13:42.137 --> 13:44.984
I was at the bus stop and Jack drives by,

13:45.003 --> 13:46.761
and stopped, and asked...

13:46.792 --> 13:47.562
if I wanted a lift,

13:47.555 --> 13:48.619
and I said, "Sure."

13:48.632 --> 13:50.096
Then, two blocks from there,

13:50.102 --> 13:54.050
he falls asleep at the wheel
and runs into a police officer.

13:54.107 --> 13:56.709
Ran right into the back of
a parked black and white.

13:56.696 --> 13:58.242
So that's why I was late.

13:58.523 --> 13:59.963
And I didn't call because I couldn't call

13:59.981 --> 14:03.667
because my cell phone fell out
of my lap and blam! Not working.

14:04.536 --> 14:07.808
The kid should not be driving
with his arm and his leg in a cast.

14:07.851 --> 14:09.685
Fortunately for him, I knew the officer.

14:09.697 --> 14:10.842
Friend of mine.

14:11.693 --> 14:14.690
Never saw her in the uniform
before. She looked kind of cute.

14:14.810 --> 14:16.905
But I didn't dilly-dally around.

14:16.917 --> 14:18.301
I just grabbed the next bus.

14:18.326 --> 14:19.740
And Jack? Is Jack all right?

14:19.771 --> 14:21.016
Well, you tell me.

14:21.029 --> 14:24.138
He's driving around half-asleep
with Jesus as his copilot.

14:24.144 --> 14:27.842
So whatever's happened,
it's on him, on Jesus.

14:28.030 --> 14:29.876
They didn't even have cars back then.

14:29.919 --> 14:31.966
Why would anyone think Jesus could drive?

14:32.028 --> 14:34.043
Or copilot, or whatever?

14:34.080 --> 14:36.338
Was Jack able to drive
the car after the accident?

14:36.376 --> 14:38.403
They wouldn't let him
drive in his condition,

14:38.441 --> 14:40.855
so they gave him and his truck a ride home.

14:40.861 --> 14:43.145
He's got this big behemoth of truck,

14:43.126 --> 14:44.878
hardly a scratch on it.

14:45.554 --> 14:47.374
Oh! And in case you're wondering,

14:47.393 --> 14:49.332
I did not tell Ricky
that you would see him.

14:49.351 --> 14:50.314
I'm sure you didn't.

14:50.340 --> 14:53.132
So, what did he want to see
you about? The wedding thing?

14:53.317 --> 14:54.893
Or really, the no wedding thing?

14:55.064 --> 14:56.465
Did he tell you they're not married?

14:59.783 --> 15:01.765
I know he told you!

15:02.551 --> 15:03.657
Hi, honey, I'm home!

15:03.777 --> 15:05.889
George! You look great!

15:06.074 --> 15:07.921
- Are you excited?
- I am.

15:08.607 --> 15:12.746
Oh, my, you look really handsome. Mmm...

15:12.791 --> 15:16.465
I'd like to drag you upstairs
and have my way with you,

15:16.630 --> 15:18.407
if I didn't have to go with Grace.

15:18.462 --> 15:19.733
You wouldn't have to drag me.

15:19.758 --> 15:22.035
But you do have to go with Grace,

15:22.045 --> 15:23.152
and I've got to start my new life.

15:23.167 --> 15:25.339
I think this is the smartest
thing you've ever done.

15:25.359 --> 15:27.846
And good for you for not sitting
around and feeling sorry for yourself

15:27.906 --> 15:29.909
and getting back out there and...

15:29.914 --> 15:31.585
- Well, you know.
- Yeah, I know.

15:31.705 --> 15:33.815
I'm sure everyone is saying it's a risk.

15:33.840 --> 15:35.166
Hey, life is a risk.

15:35.154 --> 15:36.605
If you want it, you got to go for it,

15:36.642 --> 15:37.962
and I'm going for it, babe.

15:38.169 --> 15:41.016
So you're not scared?
Not even a little bit?

15:41.034 --> 15:42.817
- Not even.
- Good for you.

15:42.830 --> 15:44.638
- Have you heard you anything from Anne?
- Nope.

15:44.758 --> 15:46.008
But I'm not going to wait around for her

15:46.039 --> 15:48.117
and I'm not going to base my
life on whatever Anne wants

15:48.135 --> 15:49.462
or doesn't want me to do.

15:49.711 --> 15:51.031
I'm a man, damn it.

15:51.063 --> 15:52.906
A metrosexual man of action.

15:53.026 --> 15:55.774
Yeah! That's what I love about you.

15:55.805 --> 15:58.464
You are a man, a real man.

15:58.533 --> 16:00.210
- Don't mess up
the hair.-- Oh.

16:00.330 --> 16:01.880
Wouldn't dream of it. Oh!

16:02.000 --> 16:03.657
Okay. So here's Tom's suitcase.

16:03.777 --> 16:05.615
He's gonna take the bus to Geoff's

16:05.646 --> 16:06.985
and then he's going home with you.

16:06.991 --> 16:08.256
He's very excited.

16:08.262 --> 16:10.721
Me, too. Have a good trip
and don't worry about a thing.

16:10.841 --> 16:13.217
I'm sorry I'm not going to
be here for your big day.

16:13.242 --> 16:14.625
I'll try to keep it very low key.

16:14.643 --> 16:16.433
You'll be here for the rest of my life.

16:16.553 --> 16:17.749
Mmm.

16:25.418 --> 16:27.082
Hey, how are you?

16:27.101 --> 16:28.352
No one got hurt.

16:28.603 --> 16:30.279
Did your mom tell you?

16:30.755 --> 16:34.302
I gave her a ride to work and this
stupid cop had her car camouflaged

16:34.327 --> 16:35.817
and I ran into the back of it.

16:35.937 --> 16:37.556
I didn't see it, no one could have seen it.

16:37.613 --> 16:39.146
No, my mom didn't tell me.

16:39.177 --> 16:40.197
You ran into a cop?

16:40.222 --> 16:41.629
It wasn't my fault.

16:41.679 --> 16:43.675
- Are you back in class?
- Yeah, I'm back in class.

16:43.644 --> 16:44.526
- Are you married?
- No.

16:44.576 --> 16:45.664
I didn't think so.

16:45.658 --> 16:47.160
I thought everybody thought so.

16:47.147 --> 16:48.443
Eh, they did and they didn't.

16:48.455 --> 16:51.221
I think it reached "who
cares" status weeks ago.

16:51.341 --> 16:52.466
Except with Ben, of course.

16:52.847 --> 16:54.380
Of course.

16:54.680 --> 16:56.038
Are you still living in the dorm?

16:56.088 --> 16:58.991
I'm living with Grace. She got
a little crazy after the accident

16:58.998 --> 17:01.087
and she wants me to be
there with her every night.

17:01.137 --> 17:03.890
Except for this week, she's going
to look at campuses with her mom.

17:04.089 --> 17:05.579
Hey, is Amy doing that?

17:05.647 --> 17:07.131
She can't decide what she's doing.

17:07.137 --> 17:08.382
All right, well, if she goes away,

17:08.451 --> 17:10.803
I can come over there
and help out with the kid.

17:10.997 --> 17:12.887
I've kept John by myself many times.

17:12.874 --> 17:14.156
I think I can handle it.

17:14.277 --> 17:16.590
He can write on my cast. Kids love that.

17:16.616 --> 17:18.212
I could just sleep on the couch.

17:18.242 --> 17:20.539
Uh, I sleep on the couch.

17:20.513 --> 17:21.646
Oh.

17:21.834 --> 17:24.574
Hey, how are you?

17:24.694 --> 17:25.738
Fine.

17:25.769 --> 17:27.296
- Are you?
- Yeah.

17:27.415 --> 17:29.342
- How's Grace?
- She's fine, too.

17:29.392 --> 17:31.569
But she's out of town, so if you
need anything while she's gone,

17:31.550 --> 17:33.346
- I can come over.
- Come over?

17:33.466 --> 17:36.169
If you or Omar need me to, yeah.

17:36.289 --> 17:37.977
I got to go.

17:43.320 --> 17:45.409
I guess you're fine, too.

17:46.004 --> 17:47.236
I guess.

17:47.356 --> 17:49.432
Even though you're not really married?

17:49.445 --> 17:50.371
Even though.

17:50.702 --> 17:52.529
Aw, I'm sorry.

17:52.748 --> 17:53.937
It's not like it didn't work out.

17:53.956 --> 17:55.451
It's just that we're not really married.

17:55.520 --> 17:56.471
We'll get married.

17:56.591 --> 17:58.041
And you're not sorry.

17:58.104 --> 17:59.580
I'm not interested either.

17:59.700 --> 18:02.571
I love Omar, and Omar loves me.

18:03.028 --> 18:04.460
Our love is real.

18:05.024 --> 18:07.576
It was different when I got married before,

18:07.614 --> 18:09.384
when Ben and I were pregnant.

18:09.984 --> 18:11.561
That was not real.

18:11.968 --> 18:13.907
That was more of an obligation.

18:14.139 --> 18:16.435
Not that we didn't come to
love each other eventually.

18:16.422 --> 18:19.025
Amy and I do not feel obligated
to be married to each other,

18:19.038 --> 18:20.420
we want to be married to each other.

18:20.420 --> 18:22.616
- But you're not married to each other.
- Nope.

18:22.635 --> 18:24.594
But we want to be married to each other

18:24.606 --> 18:25.607
and we're going to be
married to each other.

18:25.638 --> 18:29.029
Before or after she goes
to school in New York?

18:29.149 --> 18:30.556
Heard from Ben.

18:30.676 --> 18:33.597
So, Amy's taking a
little tour of the school?

18:33.572 --> 18:35.835
- She hasn't decided yet.
- Oh, I think she has.

18:35.818 --> 18:38.271
Whatever. She should
take a tour of the school.

18:38.309 --> 18:39.742
It's an honor to get into that school,

18:39.760 --> 18:41.625
and if she wants to go
there, she can go there.

18:41.656 --> 18:43.464
We'll work it out. I love her, Adrian.

18:43.584 --> 18:44.640
I love Amy.

18:45.153 --> 18:48.667
See, you don't sound like you love Amy.

18:48.857 --> 18:51.091
But I love Omar.

18:51.328 --> 18:54.251
And Omar would never take
off and move to New York

18:54.301 --> 18:55.915
for school or anything else

18:55.934 --> 18:57.285
because I'm in school here

18:57.405 --> 18:58.843
and our lives are here

18:59.037 --> 19:00.495
and he loves me.

19:00.519 --> 19:01.608
He.

19:01.671 --> 19:03.078
Loves. Me.

19:03.103 --> 19:04.979
I'm so sorry, I'm new.

19:05.099 --> 19:06.218
Can I get you guys anything?

19:06.268 --> 19:09.372
Ooh. Bad timing. We are right
in the middle of a conversation.

19:10.485 --> 19:12.631
Are you Clementine's friend, Ricky?

19:13.062 --> 19:14.934
Yes, he is.

19:15.054 --> 19:16.554
This is for you.

19:21.184 --> 19:22.529
Oh, boy.

19:27.579 --> 19:31.627
Oh, this is going to get
good. I knew it! I knew it!

19:36.150 --> 19:37.808
- Hi.
- Hi.

19:42.000 --> 19:44.359
What were you doing in
the counselor's office?

19:44.401 --> 19:46.267
- What?
- Jody and Francine said

19:46.286 --> 19:47.538
you were in the counselor's office.

19:47.569 --> 19:49.302
I thought you weren't
friends with them anymore.

19:49.314 --> 19:50.791
I hate them.

19:51.160 --> 19:53.493
I was accused of cheating on a math test.

19:53.505 --> 19:54.976
Were you cheating on the math test?

19:55.013 --> 19:56.139
- Yes.
- Why?

19:56.139 --> 19:58.861
There's no other way for me to
pass math. I'm not good at math.

19:58.981 --> 20:00.600
I am. I could help you.

20:00.650 --> 20:02.333
- Uh...
- No.

20:02.383 --> 20:04.354
Why? 'Cause I'm a girl?

20:04.388 --> 20:07.038
No, don't be ridiculous. I
know girls can be good at math.

20:07.056 --> 20:08.808
Then why don't you let me help you?

20:08.983 --> 20:11.429
Because you're not just
any girl who's good at math,

20:11.436 --> 20:12.612
you're my girlfriend.

20:12.606 --> 20:14.364
I would find that humiliating.

20:14.420 --> 20:15.809
For me to help you with math?

20:15.859 --> 20:17.400
Yes. I don't need your help.

20:17.434 --> 20:19.012
You'll just cheat instead?

20:19.019 --> 20:21.071
No, the counselor put a stop to that.

20:21.191 --> 20:23.660
So I'm just going to accept
that math is just not my thing

20:23.673 --> 20:25.089
and I'm never going to be good at it,

20:25.074 --> 20:27.191
so I'll just fail.

20:27.311 --> 20:29.811
You'll just fail rather
than let me help you?

20:30.314 --> 20:32.201
Look, Margaret's tried to help me,

20:32.213 --> 20:34.754
Shakur's tried to help
me. I can't be helped.

20:34.948 --> 20:37.234
Even if I let you help
me, you can't help me.

20:37.354 --> 20:40.309
So the plan is just to
fail Algebra 1 and 2,

20:40.324 --> 20:42.705
and Geometry and Calculus
is out of the question.

20:42.825 --> 20:43.994
- Right.
- Ethan,

20:44.032 --> 20:45.884
it's too early to decide
you're not good at math.

20:45.952 --> 20:47.247
You can get good at math.

20:47.264 --> 20:48.249
You're going to need math.

20:48.299 --> 20:49.238
For what?

20:49.358 --> 20:52.040
For thinking! And for getting
through high school and college.

20:52.047 --> 20:54.118
I have no plans to go to college.

20:54.131 --> 20:56.965
Well, I do. And frankly,
that's kind of horrifying,

20:56.996 --> 20:58.454
that I stayed here to be with you

20:58.460 --> 21:00.456
and you don't even want
to try to be good at math.

21:00.631 --> 21:03.691
No. I don't. No interest whatsoever.

21:15.965 --> 21:17.398
Hey, I need some help.

21:17.379 --> 21:19.444
- With?
- Math. Algebra.

21:19.463 --> 21:22.297
Oh. You should talk to
Ricky, I'm not great in math.

21:22.299 --> 21:24.774
I mean, I'm okay at it,
but Ricky is like a genius.

21:24.818 --> 21:27.959
If you think he's a genius, I'm
surprised you haven't grabbed him up,

21:27.984 --> 21:29.360
married the guy.

21:30.092 --> 21:32.519
So you've heard that we're not married.

21:32.550 --> 21:34.477
So hear this. We're getting married.

21:34.534 --> 21:36.961
Amy, you are running out of time.

21:36.961 --> 21:39.126
I need to tell the school if
you're going on that campus tour,

21:39.107 --> 21:40.633
and I think you should go.

21:40.596 --> 21:42.580
Uh, yeah, okay.

21:42.542 --> 21:44.094
- You're going to go?
- Um...

21:44.113 --> 21:47.291
I didn't really want to
share this information.

21:47.324 --> 21:50.306
Please. It's high school.
All information is shared.

21:50.294 --> 21:52.083
And go. I don't care.

21:52.429 --> 21:54.723
All right. Well, then, I'm going.

21:54.754 --> 21:57.289
No, don't do what I say.
I don't know anything.

21:58.435 --> 22:00.351
Are you going or not?

22:00.798 --> 22:02.350
- Yeah.
- Good.

22:04.846 --> 22:07.155
What campus tour? Not the one in New York?

22:07.161 --> 22:08.456
You can't go to that school.

22:08.445 --> 22:10.652
You can't go and be
married to Ricky, anyway.

22:10.689 --> 22:13.229
His life is here. He's already in college,

22:13.242 --> 22:14.681
he's working at the butcher shop,

22:14.681 --> 22:16.233
he has an apartment with free rent.

22:16.286 --> 22:17.778
What kind of wife are you?

22:17.803 --> 22:18.873
I'm not a wife.

22:18.904 --> 22:21.913
But I plan on being a very
good wife when I am a wife.

22:21.938 --> 22:24.341
And I can go to school in New
York and still be married to Ricky.

22:24.461 --> 22:27.463
I'm no good with math, but
I'm very good with people.

22:27.583 --> 22:28.802
No, you can't.

22:34.890 --> 22:36.503
- Hey.
- Hey.

22:36.509 --> 22:38.537
Adrian told me that
you're going to New York.

22:38.774 --> 22:40.426
Ugh. I didn't say it was definite.

22:40.445 --> 22:42.434
But I told Ben that I
was thinking about it.

22:42.446 --> 22:43.786
But, well...

22:43.767 --> 22:45.663
Look, Amy, I love you.

22:45.783 --> 22:48.617
Don't guilt yourself into
turning down that opportunity

22:48.654 --> 22:50.550
for me or for John.

22:50.612 --> 22:53.828
You can do what's best for
you and still be married to me.

22:54.425 --> 22:56.459
What's with the change of attitude?

22:56.493 --> 22:57.463
I don't know.

22:57.469 --> 23:00.303
I got to campus and it's beautiful there,

23:00.364 --> 23:02.368
and I love it and I love going to college,

23:02.374 --> 23:03.550
and I love my life with you.

23:03.550 --> 23:05.590
I want you to love
wherever you go to school

23:05.596 --> 23:07.960
and love your life with me just as much.

23:08.080 --> 23:10.473
So I'm going to quit being a jerk
and try to be supportive here.

23:10.784 --> 23:12.510
You sure something didn't happen?

23:12.523 --> 23:13.443
Nothing happened.

23:13.477 --> 23:15.620
So it's okay with you?

23:15.740 --> 23:17.009
It's okay with me.

23:17.034 --> 23:19.881
John and I will be fine, everything
will be fine. Everything is fine.

23:19.931 --> 23:23.553
Thank you, Ricky. Thank
you. I don't deserve you.

23:23.616 --> 23:25.718
No, you deserve someone better than me,

23:25.838 --> 23:27.914
but I'm hoping you'll choose to be with me

23:27.970 --> 23:29.259
and keep choosing to be with me.

23:29.509 --> 23:30.516
I love you.

23:30.636 --> 23:31.698
I love you, Amy.

23:31.818 --> 23:34.739
So, how's it going, Miss Juergens?

23:35.227 --> 23:37.979
Did you tell Adrian that I'm thinking
of going to school in New York?

23:38.004 --> 23:40.570
Let me see. Adrian and I last talked...

23:40.690 --> 23:41.983
When? When was that?

23:42.008 --> 23:43.447
Oh. Yeah. I did.

23:43.491 --> 23:47.877
Well, if you were hoping to cause
some sort of problem, you didn't.

23:48.140 --> 23:49.785
Some sort of problem like what?

23:49.905 --> 23:51.343
I mean, what would be a bigger problem

23:51.387 --> 23:52.576
than having to go around and tell people

23:52.594 --> 23:54.450
you're not married, after
you said you were married?

23:54.791 --> 23:56.955
Yikes, you must be having a terrible day.

23:57.018 --> 23:58.432
No, I'm not. You know why?

23:58.552 --> 23:59.139
Why?

23:59.189 --> 24:03.081
Becaus Ricky told me that he totally
supports me, being in NEw York.

24:04.257 --> 24:08.030
Either just touring the campus,
or going to school there.

24:08.232 --> 24:10.763
Because he wants me to be
happy because he loves me.

24:10.883 --> 24:14.270
Uh-oh. I would be very
suspicious if I were you.

24:14.304 --> 24:16.388
I don't even know what that means.

24:16.714 --> 24:18.474
Are you going to New York?

24:18.509 --> 24:19.836
Yeah, I'm going to New York.

24:20.073 --> 24:22.582
And to Chicago. And then to Miami.

24:22.639 --> 24:25.223
And then to London, Paris and Rome.

24:25.635 --> 24:27.749
You want to go? We could
travel the world together.

24:27.818 --> 24:30.146
We could go to some exotic
college that no one's ever seen,

24:30.171 --> 24:31.220
just the two of us.

24:31.255 --> 24:32.717
I'm getting married, Ben.

24:32.837 --> 24:35.626
Well, so far we've been
able to work around that.

24:35.607 --> 24:37.084
What happened to Dylan?

24:37.294 --> 24:38.461
We're just friends.

24:38.495 --> 24:40.649
Just like you'll be
friends with Ricky some day.

24:41.044 --> 24:42.131
See ya.

24:51.443 --> 24:52.198
Hi.

24:52.755 --> 24:54.107
Hey, baby, how are you?

24:54.412 --> 24:55.815
What's going on?

24:56.034 --> 24:58.118
What is going on is that
I have to go to New York.

24:58.318 --> 25:00.176
- For?
- Lunch.

25:00.226 --> 25:02.553
I'm having lunch with
my boss's boss's boss.

25:02.587 --> 25:05.006
The Chief Executive Officer
wants to have lunch with me.

25:05.457 --> 25:07.746
- Oh. When?
- Tomorrow.

25:08.393 --> 25:09.597
But I don't have time to shop.

25:09.610 --> 25:10.724
I don't know what I would take to New York.

25:10.730 --> 25:12.626
You have school tomorrow.
I'm taking the red eye.

25:12.651 --> 25:14.379
I'll have lunch and then
I'll take the red eye home.

25:14.371 --> 25:16.298
So what are you saying?

25:16.286 --> 25:18.438
I wouldn't miss but a day of classes.

25:18.976 --> 25:21.071
You're not going to miss any classes, babe.

25:21.540 --> 25:23.136
You're not going this
trip. Maybe next trip.

25:23.144 --> 25:24.256
Why not this trip?

25:24.231 --> 25:25.896
They didn't ask for you and me to meet

25:25.920 --> 25:27.977
with the CEO of the
company, they just asked me.

25:28.000 --> 25:29.025
I'm sorry.

25:29.145 --> 25:32.137
Okay, so they asked you,

25:32.257 --> 25:34.218
- now you ask me.
- I can't.

25:34.265 --> 25:35.469
You can if you want.

25:35.492 --> 25:38.284
I think it's enough pressure that I
have to fly to New York for this meeting

25:38.290 --> 25:40.405
without taking my lovely fiancée.

25:40.525 --> 25:43.985
Oh! Is it pressure for you
to take me out to lunch?

25:44.001 --> 25:46.980
With the boss's boss's boss?
Yeah. That would be pressure.

25:47.100 --> 25:49.201
But I'm sure there will
be other opportunities,

25:49.232 --> 25:51.500
for the two of us to go to
company functions together.

25:51.531 --> 25:52.908
Just not this time.

25:52.916 --> 25:56.106
Okay, okay. I'll go to New York,

25:56.226 --> 25:57.444
but I won't go to lunch.

25:57.442 --> 26:00.423
I'll do something else instead. I'll shop.

26:00.423 --> 26:03.606
There's not another seat on the
flight, and you have to go to school,

26:03.726 --> 26:05.449
and I have to go to this lunch meeting.

26:05.740 --> 26:07.382
All by myself.

26:07.899 --> 26:10.354
Oh, look whose pouting! That's cute.

26:10.388 --> 26:13.748
Cute? I am not cute. I'm a grown woman.

26:13.795 --> 26:15.587
And we're engaged to be married.

26:15.571 --> 26:17.299
And I want to go to New York.

26:17.776 --> 26:20.928
Is the CEO of the company
a woman by any chance?

26:20.944 --> 26:22.533
Well, I've hit the jackpot here.

26:22.797 --> 26:25.236
- Cute. And jealous.
- I'm not cute or jealous!

26:25.270 --> 26:26.403
The CEO is a woman.

26:26.438 --> 26:28.022
Oh! Then I'm going.

26:28.076 --> 26:30.032
This is so not the reaction I expected.

26:30.079 --> 26:31.575
I've never seen you jealous before.

26:31.610 --> 26:33.630
I've been jealous, but
I've never seen you jealous.

26:33.895 --> 26:36.228
You know I love you. I'm not
going to run off with this woman.

26:36.242 --> 26:38.163
How do you know that? You don't know that.

26:38.150 --> 26:41.114
She's flying you all the
way across the country

26:41.130 --> 26:42.038
for a sandwich.

26:42.045 --> 26:44.830
Adrian, Ms. Wilkenson is 73.

26:44.950 --> 26:46.464
She's 50 years older than I am.

26:46.458 --> 26:47.262
I don't think she wants a boy toy.

26:47.270 --> 26:49.029
- Then what's she want?
- She wants to meet me.

26:49.045 --> 26:50.429
She's excited about the project.

26:50.460 --> 26:52.263
Oh, I bet she is.

26:52.297 --> 26:54.739
I bet she's totally hot for it.

26:54.927 --> 26:58.306
Okay, look. If you want to get
on a flight tomorrow morning,

26:58.303 --> 26:59.440
then you meet me in New York,

26:59.464 --> 27:00.879
we'll stay an extra night or two.

27:00.887 --> 27:01.911
But you'll be missing school

27:01.919 --> 27:04.189
- and I don't think you really want to do that.
- Yes, I do.

27:04.211 --> 27:06.518
I want to miss school and
go with you to New York.

27:06.549 --> 27:07.511
I mean...

27:07.545 --> 27:10.546
Can't you move the meeting to next week?

27:10.585 --> 27:11.515
No.

27:11.549 --> 27:13.150
You suck, you know that?

27:13.127 --> 27:14.385
I know that.

27:14.419 --> 27:15.739
You want to drive me to the airport?

27:15.746 --> 27:17.458
I'm not going to drive you to the airport.

27:17.482 --> 27:18.514
I didn't think so.

27:18.491 --> 27:21.517
So when the company offered to
send me a car, I took 'em up on it.

27:21.637 --> 27:25.428
Now, your job as the woman I
love the most in the entire world

27:25.463 --> 27:28.572
is to be supportive and
send me off feeling good.

27:28.900 --> 27:31.544
I'm not having sex with you when
you're going off and leaving me here.

27:31.559 --> 27:33.475
I didn't mean have sex with me!

27:33.874 --> 27:36.407
On the other hand, it
is a really big meeting.

27:36.441 --> 27:37.949
No. 

27:37.996 --> 27:40.131
All right, then. I'm headed out.

27:46.184 --> 27:48.052
Are you sure I can't go with you?

27:48.172 --> 27:50.485
I'm sure. But if you're nice to me,

27:50.524 --> 27:52.628
I'll bring you anything
from the airport you want.

27:52.659 --> 27:53.910
Ugh!

27:54.168 --> 27:56.289
You know, your dad thought
we would meet him at Geoff's.

27:56.328 --> 27:57.610
I tried to call him, but I can't get him.

27:57.618 --> 28:01.490
Yeah, well, I didn't really feel
like meeting him and Kathleen anyway.

28:01.499 --> 28:04.306
Yeah, but we said we would and
I don't think Kathleen is there,

28:04.337 --> 28:06.605
he never mentioned Kathleen.

28:06.996 --> 28:10.632
Besides, I think you were kind
of planning to do this all along.

28:10.752 --> 28:12.869
Well, I was hoping you would come around,

28:12.861 --> 28:14.707
but if you didn't, I wouldn't have gone.

28:14.722 --> 28:16.380
You could wait until tomorrow.

28:17.381 --> 28:20.447
I get an extra day if I take the red eye.

28:20.452 --> 28:22.379
All right, have your extra day.

28:22.426 --> 28:24.177
We'll miss you, but you have a good time.

28:24.222 --> 28:25.874
I just love New York.

28:26.109 --> 28:29.033
I mean, I don't know how we'd ever work
it out for me to go to school out there,

28:29.065 --> 28:32.295
but I just want to feel like
I can go there if I want to.

28:32.330 --> 28:33.656
- You can.
- How?

28:33.640 --> 28:36.381
I mean, really.

28:36.501 --> 28:39.138
How could we work it so
that I could go there?

28:39.177 --> 28:41.086
Well, I think I could
manage keeping John here,

28:41.101 --> 28:42.626
so he can go to his same nursery

28:42.603 --> 28:44.341
and not have any changes,

28:44.376 --> 28:46.826
and you could fly in every
other weekend or something?

28:47.312 --> 28:48.531
Yeah.

28:49.247 --> 28:52.316
Or I could fly here once a month

28:52.350 --> 28:55.053
and you could fly with John
to New York once a month.

28:55.100 --> 28:59.323
Yeah. That would work. We're a modern
couple, it's a modern arrangement.

29:00.258 --> 29:03.293
- Yeah. It is.
- I told Ethan he can come over tonight.

29:03.328 --> 29:05.439
Mom's going to drop him off
on her way to the clinic.

29:05.431 --> 29:07.073
She's got something going on tonight.

29:07.128 --> 29:08.575
He needs help with his math.

29:08.598 --> 29:10.215
He needs help with his life.

29:10.257 --> 29:11.888
Kathy could help him with his math.

29:12.008 --> 29:13.799
Does he really not want her to help him

29:13.776 --> 29:15.457
just because she's his girlfriend?

29:15.496 --> 29:17.155
He finds it emasculating.

29:17.147 --> 29:18.234
Yeah. I know.

29:18.257 --> 29:21.925
He needs work. But hey, don't we all?

29:23.098 --> 29:25.694
Madison and Lauren are going
to be taking me to the airport.

29:25.710 --> 29:27.284
I know, you told me.

29:27.318 --> 29:29.785
Or they can stay here and I'll take you.

29:29.785 --> 29:32.530
No, you've done enough.

29:33.358 --> 29:35.526
Thanks for making me feel okay about going.

29:35.560 --> 29:37.574
If you love someone...

29:38.795 --> 29:40.132
Finish it.

29:41.931 --> 29:43.434
Set them free.

29:43.761 --> 29:46.470
If they come back, they're yours.

29:46.590 --> 29:48.805
And if they don't, they never were.

29:52.544 --> 29:54.444
Of course the guy who wrote that

29:54.479 --> 29:56.993
was divorced twice and married three times.

30:06.291 --> 30:07.262
George! There you are.

30:07.292 --> 30:08.662
- Here I am.
- Hi.

30:08.716 --> 30:10.640
Hi, Ben. Glad you could make it.

30:11.429 --> 30:13.847
I didn't tell him. Should I tell him?

30:13.967 --> 30:15.499
Go ahead.

30:15.533 --> 30:18.188
Nah, it's your news, you tell him.

30:18.203 --> 30:20.283
Here. Sit down. Join us.

30:20.472 --> 30:23.661
- What's going on?
- Oh, nothing much. How's your dinner?

30:23.716 --> 30:25.859
Oh, it's great. I'm not that hungry though.

30:25.898 --> 30:27.720
I'm flying out tonight.

30:27.728 --> 30:30.732
I'm gonna go check out
Hudson University in New York.

30:31.583 --> 30:33.317
They're not married.

30:33.351 --> 30:35.463
Yeah, well, who knows
what will happen with that?

30:35.487 --> 30:37.958
- Exactly.
- So you're flying out tonight, huh?

30:37.957 --> 30:40.882
Yeah, the driver is going to come
get me after we're finished up here.

30:41.002 --> 30:43.375
You want anything for the flight?
You might get hungry later.

30:44.323 --> 30:46.211
You tell him!

30:46.331 --> 30:47.827
I bought the restaurant.

30:47.947 --> 30:49.477
This restaurant?

30:49.970 --> 30:51.565
Congratulations, George.

30:51.596 --> 30:52.534
To me!

30:52.654 --> 30:54.513
To George.

30:58.204 --> 31:00.191
Tom, you all right? Where are you buddy?

31:00.464 --> 31:01.755
I'm here.

31:01.770 --> 31:03.725
There you are!

31:03.749 --> 31:06.064
Four transfers, but I made it.

31:06.087 --> 31:07.511
So, you want to have a drink at the bar?

31:07.542 --> 31:08.754
You want to sit down and
have a steak? You hungry?

31:08.785 --> 31:10.592
The bar? I don't drink.

31:10.631 --> 31:13.031
But I'd like to have a steak at the bar.

31:13.063 --> 31:15.112
Whatever you want, sir.
That's the policy here.

31:15.088 --> 31:18.146
How do you know what the policy is?

31:18.130 --> 31:19.609
Do you work here?

31:19.729 --> 31:21.181
I don't just work here,

31:21.564 --> 31:22.549
I'm the new owner.

31:22.669 --> 31:24.481
- Say what?
- I bought out Geoff.

31:24.504 --> 31:26.444
- Congratulations!
- Thank you, Tom.

31:26.498 --> 31:28.446
Are you going to change the name?

31:28.566 --> 31:29.736
I'm not going to change a thing.

31:29.783 --> 31:30.753
The restaurant's doing well.

31:30.753 --> 31:32.919
Take a seat at the bar, I'll be right in.

31:35.875 --> 31:38.003
Well, hello, ladies. The
hostess will be right with you.

31:38.026 --> 31:40.975
Is it just the two of you or will
your boyfriends be joining you?

31:41.014 --> 31:43.039
 It's just the two of us.

31:43.070 --> 31:45.448
And could we have a booth, please?

31:45.480 --> 31:46.434
Did you have a reservation?

31:46.554 --> 31:49.844
Under Gorgeous and Beautiful perhaps?

31:50.993 --> 31:53.386
Give 'em the best booth in the house.

32:00.175 --> 32:03.530
George, you can't be giving
away dinner and making any money.

32:03.577 --> 32:05.461
When's the last time anyone
bought you dinner, huh?

32:05.581 --> 32:08.019
- It's been a while.
- Next time, bring Camille and Chloe.

32:08.019 --> 32:09.403
Absolutely.

32:09.523 --> 32:12.860
Just wanted a little time alone
with Ben before he took off.

32:12.915 --> 32:15.191
He can't be seriously
going after Amy, can he?

32:15.222 --> 32:17.240
I don't know. He's still seeing Dylan

32:17.287 --> 32:18.733
and he's still friends with Adrian.

32:18.757 --> 32:20.282
I don't know what's in that kid's head.

32:20.297 --> 32:22.143
Yeah. Teens, huh?

32:22.263 --> 32:23.659
Only for another year.

32:23.698 --> 32:25.513
Scary.

32:25.633 --> 32:28.360
They're growing up, but that's
what they're supposed to do.

32:28.368 --> 32:30.456
They're getting older. I don't
know if they're growing up.

32:30.432 --> 32:32.176
But I am.

32:32.223 --> 32:35.516
So, what do you think? Was this a wise
business decision buying this place?

32:35.899 --> 32:37.268
You'll do well here.

32:37.307 --> 32:39.950
It's a people business
and you're a people guy.

32:39.911 --> 32:41.170
Thanks, Leo.

32:41.209 --> 32:42.241
You going to change anything?

32:42.273 --> 32:43.977
Nope. People don't like change,

32:44.016 --> 32:46.409
and, well, if I change anything,
I'm going to do it really slowly.

32:46.441 --> 32:49.913
If you don't mind my asking,
what made you decide to do this?

32:49.898 --> 32:52.471
Eh... I realized I was going
to have some time on my hands.

32:52.503 --> 32:55.506
Anne is going to keep Robie
close to her and his father.

32:55.626 --> 32:56.358
I heard.

32:56.478 --> 32:59.009
I want to see him, but, frankly,
I thought I'd look like a loser

32:59.017 --> 33:00.159
if I just was sitting at home,

33:00.143 --> 33:02.357
taking in whatever profit I got
out of the furniture business,

33:02.373 --> 33:04.508
- which relies on Anne a lot these days.
- Mmm.

33:04.628 --> 33:07.393
I want to get out of it altogether.
I want to cut all ties with Anne,

33:07.417 --> 33:09.943
and I want to get married to
Kathleen and start life over.

33:10.063 --> 33:11.155
So, this is step one.

33:11.178 --> 33:13.908
Good for you, George. Good for you.

33:13.947 --> 33:15.582
Goodnight. See you.

33:30.582 --> 33:30.615
Thanks.

33:31.052 --> 33:32.898
Oh, thank you.

33:35.588 --> 33:37.614
Excuse me.

33:41.446 --> 33:43.425
- Hey, what are you doing here?
- Hey, what are you doing here?

33:45.156 --> 33:47.069
I'm going to tour Hudson University.

33:47.116 --> 33:48.986
And I'm just going for a business lunch.

33:49.106 --> 33:50.894
All the way to New York
for a business lunch?

33:51.014 --> 33:53.983
I just got a job. I wanted to
get my masters while I worked,

33:53.998 --> 33:55.828
but I got a really big job.

33:55.948 --> 33:57.752
I sold this idea I've had for a while.

33:57.784 --> 33:58.855
Really?

33:58.975 --> 34:02.946
Yeah. I want to put school on
DVDs and public broadcasting

34:02.953 --> 34:04.001
and make it available to everyone.

34:04.009 --> 34:05.777
Take the best teachers in the country

34:05.808 --> 34:07.122
and have them teach each grade

34:07.169 --> 34:09.875
and others will teach each subject area.

34:10.078 --> 34:13.206
Wow. That is a really great idea.

34:13.222 --> 34:14.732
It just happened, really.

34:14.779 --> 34:16.257
But it is huge.

34:16.377 --> 34:18.438
They gave me a first class
ticket, I didn't even know.

34:18.478 --> 34:19.775
Nice!

34:19.896 --> 34:23.639
Yeah, my grandmother gave me some money

34:23.639 --> 34:24.672
and I kind of splurged.

34:24.703 --> 34:26.964
I was just so excited
that I got to go, so...

34:27.083 --> 34:30.116
It is the red eye, so it
wasn't that bad. I guess.

34:31.257 --> 34:33.134
So are you going to be
traveling back and forth a lot?

34:33.158 --> 34:35.074
I think I'm going to be traveling all over.

34:35.097 --> 34:37.364
I did hear that you gave Adrian a ring.

34:38.280 --> 34:39.774
Yep, we're engaged.

34:39.797 --> 34:41.697
But we're going to take it slow,

34:41.705 --> 34:43.746
maybe get married in
the next couple of years.

34:43.866 --> 34:48.203
Um, I guess Adrian told you
that Ricky and I aren't married.

34:48.234 --> 34:49.799
- No?
- No.

34:49.844 --> 34:52.277
But we're going to get married.

34:52.398 --> 34:56.188
Um... We just ran off and things
got crazy and we lied and...

34:56.308 --> 34:58.573
I don't know. I'm just a senior.

34:58.693 --> 35:01.999
But we have John so we're
just trying to figure it out.

35:02.038 --> 35:05.205
We want to get married, but I have
a lot going on with my family and...

35:05.237 --> 35:06.590
And you're young.

35:06.582 --> 35:08.490
Well, Ricky is the same age as Adrian.

35:08.725 --> 35:10.758
You're right. Adrian's young, too.

35:10.781 --> 35:12.236
But we're going to take our time,

35:12.275 --> 35:14.824
get married in the next couple of years.

35:14.848 --> 35:16.662
That's what the engagement is,

35:16.678 --> 35:17.929
a commitment to get married.

35:18.049 --> 35:19.242
Well, Ricky and I aren't married,

35:19.258 --> 35:20.369
but I guess we're still engaged.

35:20.489 --> 35:21.456
You guess?

35:21.487 --> 35:23.082
No, no... 

35:23.051 --> 35:24.888
No. We're engaged.

35:25.397 --> 35:26.601
I just don't know where
I want to go to school

35:26.632 --> 35:29.002
and Ricky wants me to
go wherever I want to go.

35:29.122 --> 35:30.635
Nice.

35:53.356 --> 35:54.920
What's your favorite neighborhood.

35:55.264 --> 35:56.688
I like Little Italy.

35:56.696 --> 35:58.401
Mmm. Me, too.

35:58.521 --> 36:00.989
Although my favorite Italian
restaurant is on the lower east side.

36:01.028 --> 36:02.545
Mine, too.

36:02.576 --> 36:04.469
"Mine, too. Mine, too."

36:04.589 --> 36:06.088
Yeah. Schiripa's.

36:06.111 --> 36:07.746
Yes! The spedino?

36:07.746 --> 36:08.614
Oh!

36:08.734 --> 36:10.609
Too bad we won't have any time to go there.

36:10.820 --> 36:12.423
Some other time. In the future.

36:12.470 --> 36:14.707
You and Ricky and me and Adrian.

36:14.714 --> 36:16.185
And John. Don't forget John.

36:16.153 --> 36:17.577
Of course, John.

36:17.819 --> 36:20.893
So, if you go to school in New York,

36:20.893 --> 36:22.410
would you bring John with you?

36:22.723 --> 36:26.954
Ricky said he'd stay here, but,
I don't know, I think I'd have to.

36:27.006 --> 36:28.807
And then Ricky would stay where he is?

36:28.822 --> 36:30.879
I don't know. It's all really new.

36:30.903 --> 36:34.164
I still think it's best that we get
married and then decide all of this.

36:34.180 --> 36:36.096
But of course, you don't
have to get married.

36:36.150 --> 36:38.622
There's plenty of single
mothers raising their sons alone.

36:38.638 --> 36:39.467
I'm not doing that.

36:39.467 --> 36:41.179
But you could do that if you wanted.

36:41.299 --> 36:43.143
I don't want to do that.

36:43.362 --> 36:44.746
I want to get married.

36:44.866 --> 36:46.825
- Do you?
- Yeah.

36:48.938 --> 36:51.127
Do you really? 

36:51.120 --> 36:52.535
Do you really want to get married?

36:52.567 --> 36:54.874
You can listen to Omar, you
don't have to get married.

36:54.994 --> 36:56.860
You were eavesdropping this whole time?

36:56.892 --> 36:58.495
Please don't tell me you texted Adrian

36:58.510 --> 37:00.020
that Amy and I are
sitting next to each other.

37:00.317 --> 37:03.460
Hmm. Let me see. When was
the last time I texted Adrian?

37:03.580 --> 37:04.892
Oh, yeah. Right.

37:05.012 --> 37:07.238
It was right before they said
to turn off the electronics

37:07.230 --> 37:08.693
and put away the phones.

37:10.585 --> 37:12.330
Great. 

37:13.519 --> 37:15.984
When is Margaret coming! Geez. It's 11:00!

37:16.047 --> 37:17.410
You don't go to bed at 11:00.

37:17.379 --> 37:18.806
She's got an emergency she's handling

37:18.831 --> 37:20.820
and you still don't
understand this stuff so...

37:20.858 --> 37:23.285
So I'm tired. I want to
go home and go to bed.

37:23.529 --> 37:24.749
What was your answer?

37:24.869 --> 37:26.176
X equals...

37:26.238 --> 37:27.352
Kathy.

37:27.627 --> 37:29.380
The answer to all this is Kathy.

37:29.373 --> 37:30.894
You know, I should have let her tutor me.

37:30.906 --> 37:33.315
No, you two would just be making out.

37:33.435 --> 37:35.373
You're not having sex, are you?

37:35.430 --> 37:37.382
Are you kidding? She just had a baby.

37:38.139 --> 37:40.493
- No!
- Do not have sex in high school.

37:40.511 --> 37:41.662
I'm just going to say it.

37:41.699 --> 37:44.314
Do not have sex in high
school. It's a mistake.

37:44.383 --> 37:46.059
Not using condoms is a mistake.

37:46.128 --> 37:48.168
My whole goal for high
school is to use a condom.

37:48.224 --> 37:49.488
Wait until you're in college.

37:49.538 --> 37:50.620
You didn't.

37:50.857 --> 37:52.659
No. I didn't.

37:54.517 --> 37:56.970
She's here! She's downstairs. Goodnight.

37:56.982 --> 37:58.872
Listen to me, don't do anything stupid.

37:58.884 --> 38:01.262
Listen to me, you're doing something stupid

38:01.268 --> 38:03.765
when you let Amy go to
New York to go to school.

38:03.827 --> 38:04.916
I got to go.

38:25.124 --> 38:27.295
- Ricky?
- Did Ben text you or not?

38:27.939 --> 38:29.641
Yeah. He texted me.

38:29.761 --> 38:32.099
He texted me, too. I'm
surprised I didn't hear from you.

38:32.812 --> 38:34.126
You were hoping to hear from me?

38:34.151 --> 38:37.160
No. I just figured you'd
get pissed off and call me.

38:38.156 --> 38:40.490
Sorry, Ricky, but I'm in love

38:40.515 --> 38:41.941
and I'm not the old Adrian.

38:41.966 --> 38:43.874
Omar's totally trustworthy, right?

38:43.906 --> 38:45.482
He better be.

38:45.658 --> 38:49.748
But, um, I know Amy is, so I'm not worried.

38:50.188 --> 38:51.817
Are you?

39:02.602 --> 39:06.900
"Ricky, I heard you and
Amy aren't really married,

39:07.319 --> 39:09.677
and maybe you'll still get married,

39:09.734 --> 39:12.136
but there's something
I want to say to you.

39:12.256 --> 39:14.594
I've always wanted to be with you.

39:14.714 --> 39:16.722
I've always been in love with you,

39:16.722 --> 39:18.755
and running into you
again after all these years,

39:18.761 --> 39:22.202
it just seemed like maybe
we're destined to be together.

39:22.440 --> 39:25.969
I can't stand to be near you
every day and not have you.

39:26.206 --> 39:27.977
I don't know if you're in love with Amy

39:27.977 --> 39:30.742
or you just feel
obligated to her and John,

39:30.993 --> 39:32.006
but time will tell.

39:32.863 --> 39:34.572
There's no way for us to ever have a life

39:34.628 --> 39:36.862
until and unless you give
your relationship with Amy

39:36.880 --> 39:39.289
every chance and
exhaust every possibility.

39:39.409 --> 39:41.529
Please try to make it work out with her.

39:41.548 --> 39:43.381
Do whatever you have to do
to make it work out with her,

39:43.400 --> 39:45.008
but if it doesn't

39:45.128 --> 39:46.966
we'll find each other again."

40:21.485 --> 40:23.330
You should have just told me
that Jack wants to sleep over.

40:23.555 --> 40:26.058
I don't care if he sleeps over. Poor guy.

40:26.178 --> 40:28.761
Everyone knows he has a
problem, he knows it, too.

40:28.780 --> 40:29.931
Very scary what he went through.

40:29.956 --> 40:33.029
I know. But he won't talk to anyone.

40:33.041 --> 40:33.879
I'll talk to him.

40:33.929 --> 40:37.145
You go get those brownies your mom
always has under that cake thing.

40:41.475 --> 40:43.308
Jack, it's me.

40:43.428 --> 40:45.585
Open up. Come on, we're going to my house.

40:47.013 --> 40:49.108
Don't shoot. It's me, George.

40:49.395 --> 40:50.372
Oh, no.

40:50.416 --> 40:51.770
I'm sorry.

40:52.581 --> 40:53.538
I'm sorry.

40:53.658 --> 40:55.903
I'm sorry, the gun, it just went off.

41:00.552 --> 41:02.304
You could have killed me!
