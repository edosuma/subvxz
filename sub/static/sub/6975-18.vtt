in these cases,
but I can't help it...

if you're not assigned
to this unit anymore.

I didn't see any reason
to pursue this oil worker case.

06:05.779 --> 06:08.304
Well, maybe you missed the fact
that this victim's corpse...

06:08.381 --> 06:10.906

I read the report, Agent Mulder,
if you're insinuating I didn't.

06:17.057 --> 06:19.355
Then you must also know that
this man was not the only man...

06:19.392 --> 06:22.987

06:23.063 --> 06:25.122

is also missing.

06:25.198 --> 06:29.225

explosion on the rig-- a ""blowout''--

to whoever gets to drill it.

09:22.976 --> 09:28.107

This incident has nothing
to do with that whatsoever.

09:46.466 --> 09:49.196
They'd like nothing better
than to use his death...

09:49.269 --> 09:51.237
to get us to abandon
the Orpheus rig...

09:51.304 --> 09:54.000
so they can be the fiirst
to drill the province.

conduct a criminal investigation...

I was coming, I hope.

11:26.966 --> 11:29.764
No, just the new

11:29.969 --> 11:32.233

11:34.307 --> 11:36.639
We still got ship-to-shore.

it said just one agent was coming.

11:39.679 --> 11:42.671
Right.
I'm the one agent.

11:42.749 --> 11:45.479

that got here this morning?

11:45.551 --> 11:49.043

12:00.800 --> 12:03.166

12:03.236 --> 12:06.501
- Can I have a word with you?
- Will you give me a minute?

12:06.539 --> 12:09.133
I'm just getting fiilled in on
the details of this investigation.

12:09.208 --> 12:11.233
Why don't you pull up a seat
and introduce yourself...

12:11.310 --> 12:13.801
and Mr. Taylor won't
have to repeat himself.

12:20.053 --> 12:21.816
Bo Taylor.

12:22.055 --> 12:24.546
I was on deck watch the night
this thing went down.

12:33.232 --> 12:35.700
Go on, Mr. Taylor.

12:35.768 --> 12:40.228
Men can go off
the deep end out here.

It's like
a cabin fever of sorts.

from their family and their friends...

12:46.846 --> 12:48.609

12:48.681 --> 12:52.310
Some of them might just
as well be doing hard time.

12:52.385 --> 12:56.481
So how's that fiigure with
the victim, Simon de la Cruz?

12:56.556 --> 13:01.323
Well, mestizos are usually
the most reliable men I know...

13:01.394 --> 13:03.830
on the drill floor.

13:03.830 --> 13:04.819
on the drill floor.

13:05.098 --> 13:08.295
But Simon just
lost his nut, I guess.

13:08.334 --> 13:11.497
It's the only good explanation.

13:11.571 --> 13:13.698
Simon de la Cruz's body
was found with flash burns.

13:13.773 --> 13:16.241
What's that got to do with him
going off the deep end?

13:16.309 --> 13:19.506
Well, hell, he tried
to blow the whole damn rig.

13:19.579 --> 13:24.141
I mean, it was sabotage
pure and simple.

13:24.217 --> 13:27.744
He knocked the cock off a gas valve
and he must've sparked it...

13:27.820 --> 13:30.653
because it went faster
than a Friday paycheck.

13:30.723 --> 13:35.160
- What about the second victim?
- Communications chief, wasn't he?

13:35.228 --> 13:39.164
Probably never knew
what hit him.

13:39.232 --> 13:43.100
What's the communications chief
doing on the drilling floor?

13:43.169 --> 13:48.129
A man can die out here, sir,
just going for a walk.

13:48.207 --> 13:51.404
Probably what happened
when it blew.

13:51.477 --> 13:54.241
Nobody even knew
he was gone...

13:54.313 --> 13:56.304
till the shift change.

13:56.382 --> 14:00.751
Well, I guess that's it--
in a nutshell.

14:00.786 --> 14:02.754

14:05.224 --> 14:07.556
Agent Mulder.

14:19.939 --> 14:21.873
[ Doggett ]

14:21.941 --> 14:24.273
Don't walk away when
I'm talking to you.

14:24.343 --> 14:26.436
Like it or not, I've
been assigned this case.

14:26.512 --> 14:29.777
One call to the Deputy Director and
you're canned for insubordination.

14:29.849 --> 14:32.147
How're you going to call
when the radio's broken?

14:32.218 --> 14:34.186
Hey, don't push me,
Agent Mulder.

14:34.220 --> 14:37.781
- You won't do it.
- You think?

14:37.857 --> 14:39.791
We're both in the same
boat, Agent Doggett...

14:39.859 --> 14:41.793
we're just paddling
in different directions.

14:41.861 --> 14:43.795
No, we're not going in
different directions here.

14:43.863 --> 14:45.763
We're going in one
direction: my direction.

14:48.868 --> 14:52.599
I don't think Kersh expects you to come
back empty-handed on this one.

14:52.672 --> 14:56.199
And since you've already told me
what you think about this case
in so many words...

14:56.275 --> 14:58.334
I don't see you coming
back with anything...

14:58.411 --> 15:00.436
that's going to protect
anybody's business interests...

15:00.513 --> 15:02.413
let alone your own ass.

15:02.481 --> 15:05.177
Wow, you really got me pegged.

15:05.251 --> 15:07.515
Anything that doesn't fiit
in my narrow fiield of vision...

15:07.587 --> 15:09.851
might as well not exist,
is that right, Agent Mulder?

15:11.824 --> 15:15.885
So why is this man Taylor lying?
You do know he's lying?

15:15.962 --> 15:19.227
I think he knows the truth
about what happened.

15:19.298 --> 15:22.665
And he may not be the only one.

15:22.735 --> 15:26.569
I never would've believed it,
these stories about you.

15:26.639 --> 15:28.869
Really?
What stories are those?

15:28.941 --> 15:32.240
That you could fiind a conspiracy
at a church picnic.

15:33.246 --> 15:35.009
What church?

15:56.869 --> 15:59.531
- Agent Scully?
- Close the door and lock it.

15:59.605 --> 16:02.870
- You said you wanted
to see me right away.
- I didn't know who to talk to...

16:02.908 --> 16:05.900
- and I haven't been able
to reach Agent Mulder.
- About what?

16:05.978 --> 16:10.881
About what I found in my autopsy
of the oil rig accident victim
Simon de la Cruz.

16:10.916 --> 16:12.884
Agent Scully, this man's body
was supposed to be...

16:12.918 --> 16:15.386
transported back to Mexico
completely intact.

16:15.421 --> 16:19.585
I found it by accident in
the third ventricle of his brain.

16:24.964 --> 16:27.364
- Agent Scully--
- No, it's okay, it's all right.

16:27.433 --> 16:29.560
What do you mean? I was
under the impression this stuff...

16:29.635 --> 16:31.603
could literally jump
into a man's body.

16:31.637 --> 16:34.697
No, it can, and I've seen that
happen, but that's the thing.

16:34.774 --> 16:37.709
I mean, this man was clearly
infected by the alien virus.

16:37.777 --> 16:41.042
It entered his system and it
was massing in the pineal gland.

16:41.280 --> 16:43.441
But it's dead.

16:44.383 --> 16:46.317
What killed it?

16:46.385 --> 16:48.785
Well, intuitively, you would say
the same thing that killed him:

16:48.854 --> 16:50.822
exposure to high
levels of radiation.

16:50.856 --> 16:55.316
But it makes no sense because the
virus itself has radioactive properties.

16:55.394 --> 16:57.328
Somebody needs to tell
Agent Doggett that.

16:57.396 --> 16:59.557
He needs to have an idea
of what he's dealing with.

16:59.632 --> 17:03.398
No, you need to tell Deputy
Director Kersh that he has to order...

17:03.469 --> 17:06.461

31:37.242 --> 31:39.267
Who?

31:39.344 --> 31:41.608
Who's coming?

31:53.258 --> 31:55.453
- [ Scully ] I think I've got something.
- [ Skinner ] What?

31:55.527 --> 31:59.395
This is an SEM image pulled at
random from anonymous donors.

31:59.431 --> 32:03.458
Blood-- more specifiically,
normal T-cell antibodies.

32:03.535 --> 32:05.730
By comparison...

32:05.770 --> 32:08.432
these are from the blood
of the oil rig worker.

32:08.506 --> 32:11.532
T-cells in impossible numbers.

32:11.610 --> 32:15.944
In layman's terms, this victim
was a virus-fiighting machine.

32:15.981 --> 32:19.417
- How do you explain that?
- Well, there are isolated cultures--

32:19.484 --> 32:22.942
Northern Italy for one-- where people
are immune to certain diseases--

32:22.988 --> 32:26.719
heart disease in that case--
through a genetic mutation.

32:26.791 --> 32:31.785
So this man had what? A kind
of genetic immunity to alien virus?

32:31.863 --> 32:33.922
Well,
his employment records...

32:33.999 --> 32:38.459
list Mr. Simon de la Cruz
as of mixed Mexican ancestry...

32:38.536 --> 32:40.902
when, in fact,
he is Huecha Indian.

32:40.972 --> 32:44.373
The Huecha are an
indigenous Mexican culture...

32:44.442 --> 32:47.411
that has a rare,
undiluted gene pool.

32:47.479 --> 32:52.280
Now, these genes may have
an innate immunity to infection.

32:52.350 --> 32:54.318
Okay, so he was immune
to the virus.

32:54.386 --> 32:56.320
That's still not
what killed him.

32:56.388 --> 32:59.482
- He died from being burned.
- No, not burned--

32:59.557 --> 33:02.526
irradiated, because the virus
had no effect on him...

33:02.594 --> 33:06.325
and the crew members
who were infected by the virus
couldn't control him.

33:06.398 --> 33:08.992
So they killed him
by irradiating him.

33:09.067 --> 33:12.298
Then why not kill Mulder?
Or Agent Doggett?

33:12.370 --> 33:17.740
- Why kill only this man?
- This man must've been a threat
because of something he knew.

33:17.776 --> 33:21.439
- What?
- That I don't know.

33:25.483 --> 33:27.451
So even if we did know...

33:27.485 --> 33:30.852
and were able to
get word to them...

33:30.922 --> 33:36.622
it'd put Mulder and Agent Doggett
in danger, too, wouldn't it?

33:50.675 --> 33:52.643
Su familia?

33:52.677 --> 33:55.578

Your family?

33:57.382 --> 33:59.509
You want to get
back to them?

34:01.453 --> 34:03.478
I can help you.

34:03.555 --> 34:07.491

Confiia en mi.

34:07.559 --> 34:10.960
Yo no confiio en nadien.

34:11.029 --> 34:13.725
Great.

34:13.797 --> 34:16.358
You trust no one.

34:22.107 --> 34:26.635
But if you stay here, they will
fiind you, just like your friend.

34:30.447 --> 34:33.576
You let me go
and we'll get you back home.

34:35.420 --> 34:37.684
You have my word.

34:38.790 --> 34:40.849
Mi promesa.

34:58.877 --> 35:01.437
[Taylor ]
Where's Garza?

35:07.886 --> 35:10.616
Where is he?

35:13.658 --> 35:15.649
I'm going to go get
Agent Mulder.

35:36.981 --> 35:40.974
Agent Doggett. There's
more where that came from.

35:46.624 --> 35:49.787
- You know anything about
radios, Agent Doggett?
- Yeah, I know a little.

35:49.861 --> 35:52.921
Well, see if what little you know can
get that ship-to-shore working.

35:52.997 --> 35:55.557
- To call who?
- Anybody who can get us
off here before--

35:55.633 --> 35:58.796
- [ Banging On Door ]
- Get to work!

35:58.870 --> 36:01.464
[ Banging Continues ]

36:16.488 --> 36:19.048
[ Banging Resumes ]

36:41.279 --> 36:43.713
- Agent Doggett!
- I'm working on it!

36:43.748 --> 36:46.080
[ Mulder ] I don't think this
door can hold much longer.

36:46.117 --> 36:48.779
[Wagner's ""Ride
of The Valkyries''Playing ]

36:48.853 --> 36:51.287
- Wagner?
- What do you want?

36:51.523 --> 36:53.991
I take it back.
It's perfect.

36:54.058 --> 36:56.049
Hold this. Hold it.

36:59.297 --> 37:01.731
[Woman ]
This is the marine operator.

37:01.799 --> 37:06.668
I repeat, this is an emergency priority
transmission for the Galpex-Orpheus.

37:06.738 --> 37:11.198
Yeah, you got John Doggett on board
the Galpex-Orpheus. Come in.

37:11.276 --> 37:14.211
- This is John Doggett.
- [ Scully ] Agent Doggett?

37:14.279 --> 37:16.213
Agent Scully, yeah,
I'm right here.

37:16.281 --> 37:18.306
- Can you hear me?
- Yes!

37:18.550 --> 37:20.916
- [ Banging ]
- What was that?

37:21.953 --> 37:24.148
That's someone
knocking on the door.

37:24.188 --> 37:26.782
Mulder, listen to me.

37:26.858 --> 37:30.316
I think I know why they killed this
man, if not how they killed him.

37:30.528 --> 37:32.996
Right now we got bigger
problems. We need a chopper.

37:33.064 --> 37:34.929
We've got choppers on the way.

37:34.999 --> 37:37.297
Tell her all the men here
are infected.

37:37.535 --> 37:41.767
She's got to get
the word to the choppers
not to land on the platform.

37:41.839 --> 37:44.899
Well, how are they
supposed to get us?

37:44.976 --> 37:48.571
Well, that issue
is rapidly becoming moot!

37:48.646 --> 37:52.605
Agent Scully, listen.
There are three men on board
here that are not infected--

37:52.684 --> 37:56.552
me, Mulder and a man named Diego
Garza, who may be mentally unstable.

37:56.588 --> 37:58.579
Could be why he tried to
wreck this radio equipment...

37:58.656 --> 38:01.022
just like his friend,
Simon de la Cruz.

38:01.092 --> 38:05.085
He may resist rescue because
he believes there men in flying
saucers are coming to get him.

38:05.163 --> 38:09.065
Agent Scully, did you get that? Agent
Scully? You're breaking up, Agent--

38:13.304 --> 38:17.206
-What the hell are you doing?
-Destroying their ability to transmit...

38:17.275 --> 38:19.641
just like Diego
and Simon de la Cruz.

38:19.711 --> 38:22.077
- What are you talking about?
- I'm talking about contact.

38:22.146 --> 38:24.774
Contact with who?
The mothership?

38:24.849 --> 38:28.148
- Agent Doggett, listen.
- Now, you just back off.

38:28.186 --> 38:30.882
No, no, no. Listen.

38:45.903 --> 38:47.871
[ Doggett ]
Where'd they go?

38:47.905 --> 38:51.170
I don't know, but I don't want
to stick around to fiind out.

38:53.344 --> 38:55.312
Let's go, Agent Doggett.

39:04.822 --> 39:07.086
Agent Mulder.

39:07.158 --> 39:09.092
We can't leave him.

39:09.160 --> 39:11.628
- Who?
- Diego Garza.

39:11.696 --> 39:14.187
Agent Doggett!

39:14.265 --> 39:16.233

39:16.300 --> 39:18.325

39:18.403 --> 39:19.927
Diego.

39:19.971 --> 39:21.962
Diego, get up.
Come on, let's go.

39:27.879 --> 39:30.643
Is he coming?

39:38.690 --> 39:40.658
No.

39:40.725 --> 39:43.353
[ Helicopter Approaching ]

39:49.734 --> 39:51.668

permission to land.

39:51.736 --> 39:53.670
Come in, Galpex-Orpheus.

39:54.872 --> 39:57.170
Agent Doggett, I think
I know why they let us go.

39:57.241 --> 39:59.106
What?

39:59.177 --> 40:02.704
Agent Mulder, what are you
talking about? What's going on?

40:05.149 --> 40:06.878
- They're going to blow the rig.
- Who?

40:13.725 --> 40:15.716
Let's go.

41:19.791 --> 41:21.850
- [ Man ] Abandon ship...
- What's he saying?

41:21.926 --> 41:23.917
[ Garbled P.A. Broadcast ]

41:23.995 --> 41:25.986
I think he wants
us to jump.

41:28.800 --> 41:30.893
[ Doggett ] All right,
wait a minute, Agent Mulder.

41:30.968 --> 41:34.961
I'm in charge here.
On a two count.

41:35.039 --> 41:37.007
How about a 20 count?

One... two!

Where's the fiire,
Agent Doggett?

42:13.611 --> 42:15.545

42:15.613 --> 42:18.081
as have Agent Scully
and A.D. Skinner.

I think it's all
hitting the fan.

42:20.484 --> 42:22.315
You mean with Galpex Oil?

42:22.386 --> 42:24.217
Word came down
that Galpex...

42:24.288 --> 42:28.122
has lost the right to drill
that entire Texas oil province.

42:28.192 --> 42:30.319
That oil should stay
right where it is.

42:30.394 --> 42:34.296
You should do everything in your
power to make sure that it does.

42:34.365 --> 42:37.300
- Me?
- [ Phone Ringing ]

tell you there's no need to see you--

42:43.875 --> 42:46.070
that the blame has been
properly assigned...

42:46.143 --> 42:48.304
for what happened
out on that platform.

his happiness when he...
