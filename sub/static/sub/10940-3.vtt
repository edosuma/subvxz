WEBVTT

00:01.367 --> 00:02.801
<i>Previously, on "Heartland"...</i>

00:02.902 --> 00:03.960
You don't understand.

00:04.137 --> 00:06.264
They're sending me to camp.
For the whole summer.

00:06.373 --> 00:07.567
So, what's your plan?

00:07.707 --> 00:08.901
To stay here?

00:09.009 --> 00:11.409
You want me to tie a big red bow
around his neck?

00:11.578 --> 00:12.567
You got me a horse
for my birthday?

00:12.679 --> 00:13.509
A horse for your birthday.

00:13.680 --> 00:15.204
You want to give me advice
about horses?

00:15.315 --> 00:16.338
I'm good with that.

00:16.516 --> 00:19.007
But you telling me
what's going on with Amy...

00:20.086 --> 00:21.075
I get it, Grandpa.

00:21.187 --> 00:23.382
We're not tearing down
your damn bunkhouses!

00:23.556 --> 00:28.220
That's right
because we're fixing them up.

00:30.897 --> 00:33.092
So, what's your first stop?

00:33.199 --> 00:36.498
Grande Prairie Rodeo.
Got a show tonight.

00:36.603 --> 00:41.097
The good thing is there's no time
to get scared and run.

00:41.274 --> 00:42.866
This just about does it, Jack.

00:42.976 --> 00:44.671
You're gonna be okay.

00:44.778 --> 00:45.802
Mom.

00:45.912 --> 00:48.710
We'll make her feel at home, Jess.

00:48.815 --> 00:52.546
Oh, well, heck, you practically
live here anyway, right, kiddo?

00:52.652 --> 00:55.246
I want you to call us every day,
anytime.

00:55.422 --> 00:57.481
That's what your cell phone's for,
okay?

00:57.857 --> 00:59.882
Don't you guys have
a long drive ahead?

00:59.993 --> 01:01.255
Go.

01:01.361 --> 01:02.589
Go!

01:02.695 --> 01:04.162
I love you.

01:04.263 --> 01:05.458
Be a good girl, okay?

01:05.565 --> 01:07.226
Jack, you take good care
of her, okay?

01:07.333 --> 01:10.461
I will attempt to keep her
out of trouble.

01:12.405 --> 01:15.636
Thanks, Jack.
We'll see you later.

01:17.710 --> 01:18.972
Come on, honey.

01:24.150 --> 01:26.118
Oh, my God,
I thought they'd never leave.

01:27.854 --> 01:31.756
Geez, you got a kitchen sink
in here?

01:33.000 --> 01:39.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:07.427 --> 02:08.894
Amy Fleming on Storm.

02:08.995 --> 02:14.126
45.637 seconds, no faults.

02:21.407 --> 02:24.035
That's not your average
Heartland horse.

02:24.144 --> 02:25.771
Nope. Great credentials.

02:25.879 --> 02:29.713
It's the kind of horse that could
take Amy all the way to the top.

02:29.816 --> 02:32.148
Not if my Ashley gets there first.

02:39.058 --> 02:42.118
Second place goes
to Roland Emery on Fox Fire

02:42.228 --> 02:44.093
from Treeridge Farms.

02:44.197 --> 02:47.462
And first place goes
to Ashley Stanton on Apollo

02:47.567 --> 02:49.865
from Briar Ridge.

02:50.003 --> 02:52.904
Well, better luck next time.

02:58.144 --> 02:59.668
Great job, Amy.

02:59.779 --> 03:00.438
Thanks.

03:00.547 --> 03:02.071
Beautiful horse.

03:02.182 --> 03:04.207
I tried to buy him,
but your dad outbid me.

03:04.317 --> 03:06.182
Well, a great horse deserves
a great rider.

03:06.286 --> 03:07.480
You got one there.

03:07.654 --> 03:08.951
See ya.

03:09.055 --> 03:10.283
He was amazing!
Did you see that?

03:10.390 --> 03:11.721
He just sailed
right over the jumps.

03:11.858 --> 03:13.917
It was like he was reading my mind.
He was so responsive.

03:14.027 --> 03:15.289
We were only off
by, like, a second!

03:15.395 --> 03:17.659
You were this close to winning.

03:17.764 --> 03:19.789
And next week's
the Spring Challenge, okay?

03:19.899 --> 03:22.163
You could take the red ribbon.
I know you can do it.

03:22.268 --> 03:24.065
Amy, you've got to take Storm
to the next level.

03:24.170 --> 03:25.102
He's got to go A circuit.

03:25.271 --> 03:27.262
Dad, that show's every weekend.

03:27.440 --> 03:29.931
Yes, it is, and you're gonna have fun.
Are you up for it?

03:31.211 --> 03:33.179
Absolutely.

03:33.279 --> 03:36.806
You hear that, boy?

03:52.498 --> 03:54.989
♪ <i>And at the break of day</i> ♪

03:55.101 --> 03:59.504
♪ <i>You sank into your dream</i> ♪

03:59.672 --> 04:03.631
♪ <i>You dreamer</i> ♪

04:03.743 --> 04:06.143

04:07.847 --> 04:13.183

04:17.890 --> 04:20.324
Geez, Mallory. Planning on staying
for the rest of your life?

04:20.426 --> 04:22.417
I couldn't decide what to bring
so I brought everything.

04:22.528 --> 04:23.586
Yeah, no kidding.

04:23.696 --> 04:25.027
You don't understand.

04:25.131 --> 04:28.066
My parents sublet our house
to some freaky artists from Toronto.

04:28.167 --> 04:31.432
They're using my room as a studio.
I don't even know what that means.

04:31.604 --> 04:33.799
Probably pottery wheels
or drumming.

04:33.906 --> 04:36.500
Or, oh, my God, naked models.

04:37.744 --> 04:38.642
AMY: Bye, Dad.

04:38.745 --> 04:40.474
I wonder how Amy did
at the show.

04:40.580 --> 04:42.878
Her and her dad
have been practicing a ton.

04:42.982 --> 04:47.681
I just have one question.
Who died and made him coach?

04:47.854 --> 04:50.254
You should go see
how she did.

04:50.356 --> 04:51.550
Later.

04:53.726 --> 04:55.591
She's got all the fans she needs
right now.

04:55.762 --> 04:58.629
Ooh. Jealous much?

05:01.834 --> 05:04.268
Mallory!

05:08.975 --> 05:11.068
This is amazing.

05:12.545 --> 05:13.842
You know, the old ranch hands

05:13.946 --> 05:15.811
never had it this good.

05:15.915 --> 05:18.281
You see the teepee?

05:22.622 --> 05:27.116
And I came in under budget.

05:27.226 --> 05:30.195
Wow, Lou, where did you get
all this stuff?

05:30.363 --> 05:32.126
Flea markets,

05:32.231 --> 05:34.859
lawn sales, the attic.

05:35.034 --> 05:37.400
I think it's pulled together
really nice.

05:37.503 --> 05:40.370
Oh, and look at this.

05:40.540 --> 05:43.338
"The Englishmars Boy,"
"Black Beauty,"

05:43.443 --> 05:45.343
"Nothing Too Good
for a Cowboy."

05:45.511 --> 05:48.969
So, are your guests coming here
to read about horses or ride them?

05:49.082 --> 05:51.448
I just want to get them
in the mood.

05:51.617 --> 05:54.450
Isn't this great?

05:56.989 --> 05:58.957
Soap?

06:01.494 --> 06:02.586
Too many creature comforts

06:02.695 --> 06:04.856
and your guests will spend
all their time inside.

06:04.964 --> 06:09.367
Dad, corporate types expect
a certain level of luxury,

06:09.469 --> 06:11.369
especially at this price point.

06:11.537 --> 06:14.734
Besides, branded stationery,
toiletry samples.

06:14.841 --> 06:16.433
It's all good branding.

06:16.609 --> 06:17.735
Guests take them home,

06:17.844 --> 06:19.744
and then they remember
to tell their friends.

06:19.846 --> 06:21.780
Leave any money in the budget
for horses?

06:21.881 --> 06:22.870
Yes.

06:23.015 --> 06:25.279
Well, I got a friend
who's a dealer.

06:25.385 --> 06:26.750
His name is Harry Oaks.

06:26.919 --> 06:29.149
He's got a string of quarter horses,
great bloodlines.

06:29.255 --> 06:30.620
I think you should give him a call.

06:30.723 --> 06:33.749
Arert quarter horses
a little bit high-end for trail rides?

06:33.926 --> 06:39.262
Well, you just said your kind
of clientele expect only the best.

06:39.365 --> 06:40.889
Check him out.

06:41.033 --> 06:43.797
Okay, I will.

06:43.970 --> 06:45.528
Where's the phone
for room service?

06:45.638 --> 06:48.971
I'll get your grandpa to make me
a grilled cheese.

06:51.110 --> 06:53.806
You're a good boy.
You did so well today.

06:53.913 --> 06:54.845
Yes, you did.

06:55.915 --> 06:59.316
You're not still talking to that
spoiled jumping horse, are ya?

06:59.452 --> 07:01.477
Last I checked, he doesn't speak
a word of English.

07:01.587 --> 07:03.680
Yeah, well, neither do you
half the time.

07:03.856 --> 07:06.154
Well, you got third.
I'd be kicking Shorty's butt for that.

07:06.259 --> 07:07.920
We lost by, like, a second.

07:08.094 --> 07:09.857
In rodeo, a second is a lifetime.

07:11.764 --> 07:13.459
So, your daddy,
he's pretty famous, huh?

07:13.566 --> 07:14.828
Yeah.

07:15.802 --> 07:17.929
All-Around Cowboy
five years running.

07:18.037 --> 07:20.938
'92 to '96.
He was the best.

07:21.040 --> 07:23.304
Roping, bull riding,
steer wrestling.

07:23.409 --> 07:25.468
Nobody could touch Tim Fleming.

07:25.578 --> 07:27.512
I even had a poster of him
on my wall.

07:28.047 --> 07:29.275
Right next
to Jennifer Love Hewitt.

07:29.382 --> 07:31.509
Oh, Jennifer Love Hewitt.

07:31.684 --> 07:35.620
What can I say?
I had a huge crush.

07:35.721 --> 07:36.813
Caleb.

07:38.424 --> 07:40.551
Maybe my dad could give you
some pointers.

07:40.660 --> 07:41.627
Do you think?

07:41.727 --> 07:43.160
Yeah, I'll ask him.

07:43.262 --> 07:45.730
Yeah, I mean,
that would be awesome.

07:48.468 --> 07:50.993
Okay, cool.
Well, I'll see you tomorrow.

07:51.103 --> 07:53.003
Yeah.

07:59.145 --> 08:01.204
Congratulations.

08:01.380 --> 08:03.473
Thanks.

08:03.916 --> 08:06.885
So, is your dad
coaching you now, or...?

08:06.986 --> 08:09.386
No, he's just sort of
helping me train.

08:10.122 --> 08:11.089
For what?

08:11.257 --> 08:12.724
The A circuit.

08:13.893 --> 08:15.417
With shows every weekend?

08:15.862 --> 08:18.558
Yeah, well, that's what you got to do
if you want to win.

08:20.833 --> 08:22.824
So, it's all about winning now, is it?

08:31.677 --> 08:33.269
How are you going to find the time?

08:33.379 --> 08:36.075
I'll make it.

08:37.616 --> 08:39.744
Well, if you want,
I can help you out.

08:39.852 --> 08:41.284
I mean, with your chores.

08:41.921 --> 08:44.116
How do you think I handled it
when you werert here?

08:46.158 --> 08:49.685
Yeah. I guess you and Caleb
managed just fine, right?

08:58.404 --> 09:02.534
So, the Spring Challenge,
we're on, right?

09:02.708 --> 09:04.232
Got the points, got the talent.

09:04.343 --> 09:05.275
Dad.

09:05.378 --> 09:07.209
Let me brag about my daughter,
please.

09:08.614 --> 09:10.081
Come on, you got to admit
it's pretty amazing

09:10.182 --> 09:11.706
what she's accomplished
without a real coach.

09:11.817 --> 09:13.307
Ty was a great coach.

09:13.486 --> 09:16.080
And Amy and Spartan did amazing
at the Fall Finale.

09:16.188 --> 09:20.147
Hmm, yeah, that was good.

09:21.494 --> 09:23.928
I'm just saying, you know...
I mean, I'm not a coach either.

09:24.030 --> 09:25.588
I could probably give her
a couple of pointers.

09:25.698 --> 09:28.724
Rodeo is about timing.
Show jumping is about timing.

09:28.901 --> 09:29.492
Question.

09:29.602 --> 09:31.968
How are you two possibly gonna
have time for the equine retreat

09:32.071 --> 09:33.629
when you're both at horse shows
every weekend?

09:33.739 --> 09:35.969
I mean, Dad, you definitely said
you'd do trail rides.

09:36.075 --> 09:37.565
I can help with the trail rides, Lou.

09:37.677 --> 09:40.976
And, Amy, you said that you're gonna
do horse exercises with the clients.

09:41.080 --> 09:43.310
I've already advertised it
on the website, so...

09:43.416 --> 09:44.940
Yeah, it's no problem.
I can do it, Lou.

09:45.051 --> 09:46.245
Okay.

09:46.352 --> 09:47.979
All this other stuff aside,

09:48.087 --> 09:51.113
don't you still attend
an institution called school?

09:51.223 --> 09:53.123
Yeah, but summer vacation is soon.

09:53.225 --> 09:55.250
You have exams first, though, right?

09:55.361 --> 09:56.350
I'm on top of it.

09:56.462 --> 09:58.987
School is priority number one.

09:59.098 --> 10:02.693
Show jumping is somewhere
way down the line.

10:02.802 --> 10:04.360
Come on, Jack.

10:04.470 --> 10:07.439
Come on, if anybody can handle
a busy schedule, it's Amy.

10:07.540 --> 10:09.701
Besides, honey,
you're an A student, aren't you?

10:09.809 --> 10:11.174
Yeah, I wish.

10:14.547 --> 10:16.708
Never mind the dishes.
You go study.

10:16.816 --> 10:18.545
All right, I got to push off.

10:18.651 --> 10:20.881
We'll do that training tomorrow,
right after school.

10:20.987 --> 10:22.716
Okay, Amy? Don't forget.

10:23.689 --> 10:26.624
- Go see those horses, huh?
- Mm-hmm.

10:27.226 --> 10:28.193
Thanks for dinner.

10:28.361 --> 10:30.591
Bye.

10:30.763 --> 10:32.492
Can I be excused?

10:32.665 --> 10:34.132
Yep.

10:37.737 --> 10:41.036
She didn't touch her food.

10:41.140 --> 10:43.370
[Knocking on door]

10:44.176 --> 10:45.473
Everything all right?

10:45.578 --> 10:47.876
Fine. It's not like
it's the first time I've stayed here.

10:49.515 --> 10:51.312
You better get started on that.

10:51.417 --> 10:54.045
And if you find that you need
a little more territory,

10:54.153 --> 10:56.280
there's always space
in the attic or the barn.

10:56.455 --> 10:58.616
Very funny.

10:58.758 --> 11:00.191
Good night.

11:22.381 --> 11:25.680
It's just me and you,
Knucklehead.

11:30.489 --> 11:32.286
Did you get those special bagels?

11:32.391 --> 11:33.915
What special bagels?

11:34.026 --> 11:36.324
Didrt you get the list of food
my mom e-mailed you

11:36.495 --> 11:37.427
with the foods I do like

11:37.530 --> 11:39.225
and the foods
that absolutely repulse me?

11:39.331 --> 11:41.765
I didn't get any e-mail
from your mom, Mallory.

11:41.934 --> 11:44.494
Oh, hey, do you want to go look
at horses with me after school today?

11:44.603 --> 11:45.934
Oh, I can't.
Dad's coming over.

11:46.038 --> 11:48.700
They already got the cheese in them.
You just stick them in the microwave.

11:48.808 --> 11:49.934
They're all I eat for breakfast.

11:50.042 --> 11:52.067
There is yogurt in the fridge
and muesli on the counter.

11:52.244 --> 11:54.576
Just saying the word "muesli"
makes me want to heave.

11:54.680 --> 11:55.840
Listen, when I'm in town,

11:55.948 --> 11:57.916
I'll get you your bagels
if I remember.

11:58.017 --> 11:59.279
How about after Dad leaves?

11:59.385 --> 12:01.512
I can't. I got to study.

12:01.620 --> 12:04.248
Are you coming?
We're going to be late.

12:04.356 --> 12:07.257
How about tomorrow?

12:07.359 --> 12:08.348
No?

12:09.161 --> 12:12.961
Okay, that's cool.
I'll just do it by myself.

12:16.135 --> 12:17.602
[School bell rings]

12:18.838 --> 12:21.568
Ah, Amy.
Just who I wanted to talk to.

12:21.674 --> 12:22.368
Really?

12:22.475 --> 12:25.000
You've consistently missed
your Earth Sciences study group.

12:25.111 --> 12:27.909
But just your luck,
I'm having one after school today.

12:28.013 --> 12:29.844
If you want to bring up
your participation mark,

12:29.949 --> 12:31.382
I suggest you be there.

12:31.484 --> 12:33.076
Okay. I will.

12:33.252 --> 12:34.241
Good.

12:34.386 --> 12:36.217
Oh, Miss Adams.

12:36.322 --> 12:38.313
I'm sorry. I can't.

12:38.424 --> 12:39.721
My dad...

12:39.825 --> 12:41.452
I've just got something else
scheduled.

12:41.560 --> 12:45.758
You're not doing yourself
any favors, are you, Amy?

12:56.776 --> 12:57.868
He's amazing.

12:58.043 --> 12:59.840
Did you see that?
He just steps over it.

13:00.312 --> 13:03.110
He kind of took the long way
around the last two, but...

13:03.215 --> 13:04.204
I'm just taking it easy.

13:04.316 --> 13:06.045
I'm a little worried
about the footing.

13:06.152 --> 13:08.017
It rained all last night,
and the ground is torn up.

13:08.120 --> 13:09.644
She shouldn't be jumping.

13:09.755 --> 13:10.881
Listen to the expert.

13:10.990 --> 13:13.390
Why don't you tell
"Coach Tim" that?

13:13.492 --> 13:15.016
What's that, hon?

13:15.161 --> 13:17.459
Ty says it's dangerous
to be jumping.

13:17.596 --> 13:18.858
That's a bunch of bull.

13:18.964 --> 13:20.295
I compete in all weather.

13:20.432 --> 13:21.990
Bit of mud's not going
to hold me back.

13:22.101 --> 13:23.466
Spoken like a true cowboy.

13:25.137 --> 13:26.570
Why don't you go again?
I'll time you.

13:26.672 --> 13:28.162
He's not a rodeo horse, Dad.

13:28.274 --> 13:29.502
I got to cool him off.

13:29.608 --> 13:31.041
Yeah, okay. Yeah, fine.

13:31.143 --> 13:34.306
You want to call it a day.
Okay, all right.

13:34.480 --> 13:36.948
We'll do it again tomorrow
when it's nice and dry.

13:38.584 --> 13:40.381
- Mr. Fleming?
- Yeah?

13:40.486 --> 13:43.580
- Do you got a minute at all?
- Sure.

13:46.826 --> 13:48.123
See what you got.

13:53.032 --> 13:55.193
Come on, Caleb!

14:00.706 --> 14:02.674
- Nice!
- Come on!

14:07.346 --> 14:08.540
A little less spur.

14:09.849 --> 14:12.545
- Go, go, go!
- CALEB: Come on!

14:13.152 --> 14:15.245
AMY: Come on, Caleb!

14:15.354 --> 14:16.150
Yeah!

14:16.255 --> 14:17.586
That's it!

14:17.690 --> 14:20.181
- AMY: Come on, Caleb!
- Work him!

14:23.329 --> 14:24.091
Come on!

14:25.731 --> 14:27.062
Easy, easy.

14:28.667 --> 14:31.227
What's the matter, boy?

14:35.808 --> 14:38.504
AMY: He's hurt, Caleb.

14:42.781 --> 14:43.975
His ankle's twisted.

14:44.083 --> 14:46.142
There's heat on his tendons.

14:46.318 --> 14:49.378
I could give him an ultrasound,
or we could wait and see.

14:49.488 --> 14:50.955
Let's wait.

14:51.123 --> 14:52.647
I've given him a mild tranquilizer.

14:52.758 --> 14:55.625
It should keep him calm
for the next 12 hours or so.

14:55.728 --> 14:58.993
But until it's fully healed,
he'll need complete stall rest.

14:59.098 --> 15:00.588
- Stall rest?
- Absolutely.

15:00.699 --> 15:02.564
And you'll have to cold hose him.

15:02.735 --> 15:04.965
Sure, I can do that.

15:05.070 --> 15:06.537
He'll be able to rodeo again, right?

15:06.705 --> 15:10.573
Keep him real quiet,
he should recover quickly.

15:10.676 --> 15:13.509
But there's no guarantees here.

15:15.080 --> 15:17.514
Caleb was just showing off
a little bit too much, that's all.

15:17.616 --> 15:20.176
Well, he was trying to impress you
is what he was trying to do.

15:20.286 --> 15:23.380
And next time, it could be Amy.

15:24.123 --> 15:25.317
You call Harry yet?

15:25.457 --> 15:26.549
I'm seeing him tomorrow.

15:26.659 --> 15:27.990
But I've been looking online,

15:28.093 --> 15:30.061
and there are some
really good prospects.

15:30.162 --> 15:31.060
Lou.

15:31.163 --> 15:33.859
You can't tell anything about a horse
from a picture off the Internet.

15:33.966 --> 15:35.661
Okay, thank you.
I know that.

15:35.801 --> 15:37.962
I was just trying to start somewhere.
Is that okay?

15:38.070 --> 15:40.834
Go see my dealer.
Save yourself some time.

15:40.940 --> 15:44.034
We're on a tight schedule.

15:44.610 --> 15:46.942
See you later, Scott.

15:47.880 --> 15:49.438
Come on, don't stress.

15:49.548 --> 15:52.540
Want to go for a coffee
or maybe something stronger?

15:52.651 --> 15:54.551
Yeah, right. I can't.

15:54.653 --> 15:56.382
I have way too much to do.

15:56.488 --> 15:57.386
What else is new?

15:59.191 --> 16:03.855
Hey, I'm sorry, okay?

16:03.996 --> 16:04.985
I got to go.

16:05.097 --> 16:07.531
I'll catch you when you have a break
in your busy schedule.

16:11.971 --> 16:14.405
[Phone rings]

16:14.974 --> 16:18.102
Yeah, she's here.
I'll get her for you.

16:18.210 --> 16:21.543
Mallory, your dad's on the phone.

16:22.514 --> 16:25.608
Well, she must be asleep, Charlie.
You want me to wake her up?

16:25.718 --> 16:29.119
Yeah, yeah. I'll be sure
and have her call you.

16:29.221 --> 16:32.247
Yeah, she's good.
No problems.

16:32.358 --> 16:36.021
Okay, talk to you later.
Bye-bye.

16:46.538 --> 16:48.267
He's keeping quiet.

16:48.907 --> 16:50.169
Yeah, he's tranked.

16:51.944 --> 16:53.912
You know,
it's a pretty common injury.

16:54.013 --> 16:56.709
Yeah, I know,
but all it takes is an infection,

16:56.815 --> 16:59.010
and boom, your horse is a goner.

17:00.452 --> 17:02.044
That's a good way of looking at it.

17:02.187 --> 17:04.451
That's just life.

17:04.556 --> 17:05.181
[Sighs]

17:05.290 --> 17:07.884
Look, I'll stay with him.
You need to study.

17:11.396 --> 17:12.954
Thanks for sitting with him, though.

17:13.065 --> 17:14.054
You're welcome.

17:16.969 --> 17:20.530
You know, I might not talk to Shorty
the way you do,

17:20.705 --> 17:23.174
but he's a real good horse and...

17:23.308 --> 17:25.742
Well, I'd be real sorry
to lose him as a partner.

17:25.844 --> 17:28.540
I know you would.

17:29.782 --> 17:32.945
I'll see you tomorrow, okay?

17:42.428 --> 17:44.089
Amy, wake up.
You're late!

17:44.263 --> 17:46.629
What? No!
Why didn't you wake me up?

17:46.799 --> 17:48.096
I thought you were already gone.

17:48.200 --> 17:49.963
But if I'm late,
that means you are, too.

17:50.069 --> 17:52.037
I'm not going to school.
I'm sick.

17:52.137 --> 17:54.298
Oh, I've got chores to do.

You were up pretty late last night.

18:03.048 --> 18:04.572
I heard you down here.

18:06.051 --> 18:08.519
Yeah. So, how's Shorty?

Trank hasn't worn off yet.

I'll keep an eye on him, though.

Just five or six at the most.

18:50.929 --> 18:52.260
Tim said you'd want them all.

18:52.364 --> 18:54.298
I could have sold some of them
last week if I'd known.

Just give me a quote.

19:01.673 --> 19:03.072
Is this for all 15?

Six.

19:05.310 --> 19:06.572
I can't afford this.

19:06.745 --> 19:08.838
You think about it.

19:13.252 --> 19:16.983
They're good horses,
but you don't need horses that good.

19:17.089 --> 19:20.525
I know my dad wants me
to buy these, but this is crazy.

19:20.626 --> 19:22.218
You just have to talk to him, Lou.

19:22.327 --> 19:24.056
It's not that easy.

19:24.163 --> 19:27.064
I don't want him to think
that I don't appreciate his advice.

19:27.166 --> 19:29.464
He's not just your dad.
He's your business partner.

19:29.568 --> 19:30.933
You have to be straight
with each other.

19:31.036 --> 19:32.765
I'm used to being straight
with the business partner.

19:32.871 --> 19:35.101
It's the dad part that's hard.

19:35.207 --> 19:37.767
You'll handle it.

19:41.046 --> 19:43.810

19:43.916 --> 19:48.944
You want to grab some lunch?
They've got veggie chili at Maggie's.

19:49.054 --> 19:52.251
I got a call out in Longview.

Hello? Dad?

What's wrong?

20:51.984 --> 20:53.645
Hay fever.
I'm allergic to hay.

20:53.752 --> 20:54.650
Since when?

20:54.753 --> 20:57.244
It just came suddenly.

21:01.326 --> 21:02.759
Yeah. Harry called me.

21:02.861 --> 21:05.523
- So, why'd you walk away?
- Too expensive.

21:05.631 --> 21:09.965
Lou, the most important part
of a dude ranch is horses.

21:10.068 --> 21:12.593
The thread count of the bed sheets
doesn't really matter.

21:12.704 --> 21:14.296
Of course the horses
are important, Dad,

21:14.406 --> 21:16.772
but they need to be
trail-ride horses.

21:16.875 --> 21:19.673
Okay. So, what do you want?

21:19.778 --> 21:22.645
Some unknown quantity
off the Internet

21:22.748 --> 21:25.376
or some old nags that you can send
to the glue factory?

21:25.484 --> 21:27.782
You know, it doesn't always
have to be all or nothing, Dad.

21:27.886 --> 21:30.582
I can get good trail horses
somewhere else and for less money.

21:30.689 --> 21:33.055
Okay. Good.

21:33.158 --> 21:35.649
Good luck with that.

21:35.761 --> 21:38.958
Well, thanks for your support.

21:50.342 --> 21:51.331
Oh, man.

21:51.510 --> 21:53.410
He sure is unappy.

21:53.512 --> 21:55.912
I mean, he's an outdoor horse.

21:56.081 --> 21:58.345
Heck, he's never even been
in a stall before.

21:58.450 --> 22:01.442
Relax. Amy will calm him down.

22:01.553 --> 22:03.851
She's got some herbs
and some special oils.

22:03.955 --> 22:07.118
I don't hold too much
for that touchy-feely crap.

22:07.225 --> 22:09.159
He hates being cooped up, period,

22:09.294 --> 22:13.526
and a bunch of herbs ain't going
to do much to change that.

22:16.368 --> 22:19.462
You've been here
for, what, four months?

what Amy can do.

Now, you're sending him a signal
that you're scared right there.

- What did you put it up to?
- 4'3".

22:54.172 --> 22:55.503

to do if you want to move up a level?

Okay, if you're not comfortable
with it, we'll ease it up gradually.

with Shorty and Caleb,

23:12.991 --> 23:14.618

to study for.

every morning to train.

have time for the horse?

23:22.467 --> 23:25.402
No. No.

23:25.504 --> 23:28.769

Okay.

23:40.218 --> 23:41.412
This one looks good.

23:41.520 --> 23:43.351
Well, like I said,
you have to get out there

23:43.455 --> 23:44.922
and see these horses
for yourself.

23:45.023 --> 23:46.752
There's so many.
I need Amy.

23:46.858 --> 23:48.120
I don't even know where to start.

23:48.226 --> 23:49.750
You got to start somewhere.

23:49.861 --> 23:51.658
You have no horses,
you have no business.

23:51.763 --> 23:53.390
- You sound like Dad.
- I'm just saying.

23:53.532 --> 23:55.056
Well, it's great to just say.

23:55.167 --> 23:56.862
That's all Dad does is just say.

23:56.968 --> 23:58.595
He doesn't do anything constructive.

23:58.703 --> 24:01.570
I'm the only one doing anything.

24:02.207 --> 24:05.370
Well, actually,
I'm not entirely useless.

24:05.477 --> 24:07.502
I just spoke to Harry
and got him to drop his price.

24:07.679 --> 24:10.443
He'll take 20% off
if you take all 15 horses.

24:10.549 --> 24:11.777
Well, thank you.

24:11.883 --> 24:16.286
But, Dad, I don't need or want all
15 of his damn quarter horses.

24:16.455 --> 24:18.047
That is still way beyond the budget.

24:18.156 --> 24:19.953
Well, somebody should have
thought about that

24:20.058 --> 24:22.925
before they bought
all the fancy soap.

24:23.094 --> 24:24.356
See you tomorrow, Amy.

24:24.463 --> 24:26.590
Bye.

24:27.466 --> 24:29.627
I got to go check on Shorty.

24:29.801 --> 24:31.200
I'll see you later.

24:31.336 --> 24:33.304
Yeah, I'll call you.
Bye, Amy.

24:33.472 --> 24:34.803
Bye.

24:35.407 --> 24:38.399
I hate this.

24:38.577 --> 24:40.169
I think I know
where you can get some horses.

24:41.346 --> 24:43.075
There's a rescue center
up on Dale's Road.

24:43.181 --> 24:44.944
They're always looking to re-home.

24:45.050 --> 24:46.574
That is a great idea.
Can we go now?

24:46.751 --> 24:47.877
I can't.

24:48.053 --> 24:49.680
That's your favorite word lately.

24:49.788 --> 24:52.120
Well, I promised Caleb
I'd help him with Shorty.

24:52.224 --> 24:54.317
Besides, I got a math exam
to study for.

24:54.426 --> 24:55.654
Just go with Dad tomorrow.

24:55.760 --> 24:57.921
Yeah, right.
Dad is always busy with you.

24:59.865 --> 25:01.298
Thanks.

25:11.042 --> 25:13.010
I don't know, Grandpa.

25:13.912 --> 25:16.244
Maybe this is all just
a stupid idea, you know,

25:16.348 --> 25:17.747
right from the start.

25:17.916 --> 25:19.349
Want some advice?

25:19.451 --> 25:21.248
I've had plenty of that.

25:22.187 --> 25:24.712
Well, your dad, he means well.

25:24.823 --> 25:27.121
He wants this business of yours
to work,

25:27.225 --> 25:29.284
and for him, it's all about...

25:29.394 --> 25:31.225
The horses. I know.

25:31.796 --> 25:32.854
Tell me about it.

25:33.031 --> 25:38.731
And while a good quarter horse
in his prime can be mighty exciting,

25:38.904 --> 25:40.872
sometimes they're a little quick
to react.

25:40.972 --> 25:42.200
They're a little too eager.

25:42.307 --> 25:44.434
A greenorn rider
can end up getting way more

25:44.543 --> 25:45.532
than he bargained for.

25:45.644 --> 25:47.612
Yeah, so, what do I do, Grandpa?

25:47.712 --> 25:51.478
Well, the kind of horses you need
aren't fancy, Lou.

25:51.583 --> 25:56.418
They're safe, slow, sure-footed,

25:56.588 --> 25:59.523
and a little on the old side,
like me.

26:03.662 --> 26:06.688
I don't know why I'm getting
so hyper about all this.

26:06.798 --> 26:08.527
You know darn well why.

26:08.633 --> 26:09.827
Why?

26:09.935 --> 26:12.768
'Cause you want to please
your dad.

26:12.938 --> 26:16.066
But mixing business and family,

26:16.174 --> 26:20.270
it's like throwing gas on a fire.

26:22.981 --> 26:25.108
He won't get better,
not if he keeps doing that.

26:26.117 --> 26:27.880
It's okay.

26:27.986 --> 26:30.113
Easy.

26:30.288 --> 26:31.550
What are you doing?

26:31.656 --> 26:33.783
It's called T touch.

26:33.892 --> 26:35.257
It just helps him relax.

26:35.360 --> 26:37.089
- Here, give me your hand.
- No way.

26:37.195 --> 26:38.787
Here, just try.

26:40.632 --> 26:41.599
There you go.

26:41.700 --> 26:43.531
Gentle circles like that.

26:43.635 --> 26:45.398
You work down his neck.

26:45.570 --> 26:48.095
There you go.

26:52.410 --> 26:56.506
Well, look at that.
It's working.

27:01.086 --> 27:02.951
Well, I saw this coming.

27:03.121 --> 27:05.021
I can just retake the course
next year.

27:05.123 --> 27:07.489
You have way too much
on your plate.

27:07.659 --> 27:09.923
You have to decide what it is
you really want to do.

27:10.028 --> 27:12.394
And failing at school
is not an option.

27:12.497 --> 27:13.930
Well, at least school
is almost over.

27:14.032 --> 27:15.624
It's not just school.

27:16.501 --> 27:19.868
You've still got chores.
You're still treating problem horses.

27:19.971 --> 27:20.995
Do you want to keep doing that?

27:21.106 --> 27:22.698
You know I do.

27:22.807 --> 27:23.739
Fine, then.

27:23.842 --> 27:26.834
You may not like this dude-ranch
thing any more than I do,

27:26.945 --> 27:30.176
but it is happening, and we all
have to pull our weight for Lou.

27:30.281 --> 27:32.681
So there's that, too.

27:32.784 --> 27:36.447
Amy, you cannot dance
at all the weddings.

27:36.588 --> 27:38.556
Sooner or later,
you have to make a choice.

27:38.657 --> 27:40.056
Something's got to give.

27:40.158 --> 27:41.147
Like what?

27:41.259 --> 27:44.786
You don't need me to tell you.

27:45.397 --> 27:46.421
You've been under the gun

27:46.531 --> 27:48.692
ever since your father gave you
that jumping horse.

27:48.800 --> 27:51.860
Grandpa, that's just...
That's just you and him.

27:51.970 --> 27:53.062
That's what this is about.

27:53.171 --> 27:54.661
That is not true.

27:54.773 --> 27:56.866
You have to face facts.

27:56.975 --> 28:00.206
Show jumping requires you
to travel all over the countryside.

28:00.311 --> 28:03.678
Do you really think you can do that
along with everything else?

28:03.782 --> 28:04.680
I do.

28:05.350 --> 28:07.045
I have to go to the show
this weekend, okay?

28:07.152 --> 28:08.983
Dad would kill me if I didn't.

28:09.087 --> 28:10.679
It's his goal.

28:10.855 --> 28:14.154
Well, for me, I mean.

28:20.398 --> 28:25.768
ANNOUNCER: 47.385 seconds,
8 jumping faults.

28:25.937 --> 28:29.771
Okay, hon, how do you feel?

28:29.941 --> 28:34.878
A lot of time, a lot of money
has gone into this, so relax.

28:34.979 --> 28:38.574
Just concentrate on the goal.
You can do this.

28:38.750 --> 28:41.378
I got a feeling today
is your winning day.

28:42.554 --> 28:44.454
Easy boy. Good boy.

28:44.556 --> 28:50.017
Number 12, Ashley Stanton
from Briar Ridge riding Apollo.

28:52.430 --> 28:54.261
[Horse neighs]

28:54.365 --> 28:55.423
Come on, Apollo.

28:58.036 --> 28:59.594
Good boy.

28:59.704 --> 29:00.796
Good boy.

29:00.905 --> 29:03.806
Ashley, don't coddle him.
Show him who's boss!

29:03.975 --> 29:05.499
Don't, Mother!

29:07.545 --> 29:08.978
There.

29:09.080 --> 29:10.707
You see?

29:14.252 --> 29:16.584
[Horse neighs]

29:25.330 --> 29:26.957
Oh.

29:34.939 --> 29:36.167
Oh.

29:36.274 --> 29:37.832
Ashley Stanton on Apollo.

29:37.942 --> 29:40.638
47.385 seconds,

29:40.745 --> 29:43.043
16 jumping faults.

29:44.516 --> 29:50.079
Number 24, Amy Fleming,
Heartland Ranch, on Storm.

30:07.238 --> 30:08.967
Amy Fleming on Storm.

30:09.073 --> 30:13.942
43.274 seconds, no faults.

30:14.612 --> 30:16.409
Can you believe my mother?

30:16.514 --> 30:19.779
I have never been
more humiliated in my life.

30:19.884 --> 30:23.877
I love jumping, and I love Apollo,
but it's just not won'th the grief.

30:23.988 --> 30:26.149
I've had it. I quit.

30:26.257 --> 30:29.488
First place, number 24,
Amy Fleming,

30:29.661 --> 30:31.128
Heartland Ranch, on Storm.

30:31.229 --> 30:32.025
[Applause]

30:32.197 --> 30:34.461
You did it!
You did it! You won!

30:34.566 --> 30:35.863
I knew you could do it!

30:35.967 --> 30:38.367
Congratulations!

30:38.469 --> 30:41.165
Let's go home.

30:49.180 --> 30:52.445
This was Amy's idea,
and I think they're perfect.

30:52.550 --> 30:54.415
Yeah, if you want
a bunch of old nags.

30:54.953 --> 30:59.185
Dad, we've built our reputation
on saving unwanted horses.

30:59.290 --> 31:01.155
This would build
on the Heartland brand.

31:01.259 --> 31:04.717
No, Lou. Our reputation
is built on quality.

31:04.829 --> 31:06.694
We don't want our guests thinking
we don't know the difference

31:06.798 --> 31:08.959
between good horses
and bad horses.

31:09.067 --> 31:11.627
These are good horses, Dad,
for trail rides.

31:11.736 --> 31:12.760
I mean, who do you think

31:12.871 --> 31:14.304
is gonna be coming
to our dude ranch?

31:14.405 --> 31:16.066
Ex-rodeo cowboys like you?

31:16.174 --> 31:17.698
They don't call them dudes
for nothing.

31:17.809 --> 31:19.936
I don't want to argue with you
about every little thing.

31:20.044 --> 31:22.274
Neither do I.

31:23.548 --> 31:25.539
Listen, I've been giving this
a lot of thought,

31:25.650 --> 31:27.675
and it's clear we don't share
the same vision.

31:27.785 --> 31:29.082
And maybe we should
seriously consider

31:29.187 --> 31:30.415
whether or not
we can work together.

31:30.521 --> 31:32.614
- Come on!
- No, listen.

31:32.790 --> 31:34.724
This is my project and my idea,

31:34.826 --> 31:37.624
and I need to be able
to make decisions as I see fit.

31:38.296 --> 31:39.820
Maybe you're right.

31:47.005 --> 31:48.097
What's wrong?

31:48.206 --> 31:49.935
Nothing.

31:50.041 --> 31:52.339
Well, you didn't seem
very happy yesterday,

31:52.443 --> 31:55.344
and you came first.

31:55.780 --> 31:57.839
- It just wasrt fun.
- It wasrt fun?

31:57.949 --> 31:59.143
No, it wasrt.

31:59.250 --> 32:01.582
Well, Amy, everything in life
isn't fun.

32:01.686 --> 32:04.484
I mean, Ashley. She has
a little trouble at the gate,

32:04.589 --> 32:05.556
and she throws it?

32:05.657 --> 32:07.284
That was ridiculous.

32:07.892 --> 32:10.224
I totally understand
where Ashley's coming from.

32:10.328 --> 32:13.297
Her mom pushed her
and pushed her, just like you...

32:14.065 --> 32:15.794
Just like I... Finish.

32:15.967 --> 32:18.492
Just like I push you?
Of course I push you.

32:18.603 --> 32:21.538
Lou still didn't get me
those special bagels.

32:21.639 --> 32:23.504
If I'd have had to throw it

32:23.608 --> 32:26.008
every time I had a little trouble
at the gate with a bull or a calf,

32:26.110 --> 32:28.101
I never would have brought home
any winnings!

32:28.212 --> 32:29.736
You got to push it!

32:29.847 --> 32:34.511
Push, push, push until you get
where you need to go.

32:35.620 --> 32:37.713
I'm not you.

32:37.822 --> 32:40.052
I can't compete with Storm
every weekend.

32:40.158 --> 32:42.058
Okay? I can't handle everything.

32:42.160 --> 32:44.560
So, what are you saying?
You want to get rid of Storm?

32:44.662 --> 32:45.959
No. I don't know.

32:46.064 --> 32:48.191
You don't know?
You don't know?

32:49.300 --> 32:50.927
If you don't want the horse,
just tell me.

32:51.035 --> 32:52.024
Dad, I love him.

32:52.136 --> 32:54.798
He's the best horse
I've ever ridden.

32:54.906 --> 32:56.271
I love Storm. He's amazing.

32:56.374 --> 32:57.363
Yeah, and he's yours.

32:57.542 --> 32:58.941
So, you don't have to ask
my permission.

32:59.043 --> 33:01.341
So, why don't you just sell him?

33:01.446 --> 33:03.641
I mean, go ahead.
That would be a shame.

33:03.781 --> 33:04.941
Do what you want to do.
Sell him.

33:05.049 --> 33:06.482
Dad.

33:08.286 --> 33:11.722
If you see your sister,
tell her to call me.

33:12.824 --> 33:15.088
[Engine starts]

33:24.869 --> 33:27.394
[Knocking on door]

33:33.444 --> 33:34.934
Dad was looking for you.

33:35.046 --> 33:37.480
I know.

33:38.049 --> 33:39.539
I told him I couldn't jump anymore.

33:39.650 --> 33:40.742
How'd that go?

33:40.852 --> 33:42.581
He was devastated.

33:42.687 --> 33:43.847
I should have never told him.

33:43.955 --> 33:45.684
Yes, you should have, Amy.

33:45.790 --> 33:48.384
You can't worry
about pleasing Dad all the time.

33:48.493 --> 33:50.256
What, like you?

33:50.361 --> 33:51.851
Hiding away in your office,

33:51.963 --> 33:55.296
running a dude ranch without
any horses or a business partner.

33:55.400 --> 33:57.061
How's that working out for you?

33:58.669 --> 34:02.435
Okay, I didn't say
it was an ideal situation.

34:02.540 --> 34:04.565
But whatever,
at least I told him how I feel,

34:04.675 --> 34:06.506
and maybe he'll come around,

34:06.611 --> 34:09.205
and if he doesn't,
then I have to move on.

34:10.447 --> 34:11.972
I just don't want to hurt him.

34:12.083 --> 34:14.380
Neither do I.

34:15.253 --> 34:17.187
It's hard.

34:18.121 --> 34:20.056
I'm not used to this.

34:20.190 --> 34:22.181
Me neither.

34:23.594 --> 34:27.655
So, what do we do?

34:29.266 --> 34:31.496
I don't know.

34:42.112 --> 34:43.842
- Here we go.
- Yeah, here we go.

34:44.014 --> 34:45.004
What?

34:45.149 --> 34:48.118
First of all, if you say
"Do what you want" to your kids,

34:48.219 --> 34:49.914
you damn better mean it.

34:50.021 --> 34:51.989
Second, don't you think
for a minute

34:52.090 --> 34:53.489
that Amy doesn't like that horse.

34:53.591 --> 34:55.525
She loves that horse,
and it's killing her

34:55.626 --> 34:56.991
to even think about giving it up.

34:57.094 --> 34:58.858
She doesn't need you
to make her feel worse.

34:58.963 --> 35:00.396
You should talk.

35:00.498 --> 35:03.296
All you do is hold those girls back.

35:03.468 --> 35:04.765
First, it's Lou and her project,

35:04.869 --> 35:06.700
over the sake of, what,
some old buildings.

35:06.804 --> 35:08.931
And now you don't want Amy
to have a show-jumping career

35:09.040 --> 35:10.439
because she's behind
on her chores?

35:10.541 --> 35:12.668
You've been gone a long time, Tim.

35:12.777 --> 35:14.108
You missed a good 10 years

35:14.212 --> 35:15.975
of seeing how these girls
think and work.

35:16.080 --> 35:18.207
Nobody knows that
more than me, Jack.

35:18.316 --> 35:20.045
So, you can't just waltz on in here

35:20.151 --> 35:23.348
and tell them what their future
looks like.

35:31.262 --> 35:34.527
I just want to help them go
as far as they can.

35:34.632 --> 35:38.591
Be the best, and you're right,
I've been away for 10 years.

35:38.703 --> 35:42.264
I missed 10 years of their life.

35:44.041 --> 35:47.067
I owe it to them.
To their mother.

35:48.246 --> 35:50.214
You know, half the time,
I don't know what I'm doing.

35:50.314 --> 35:52.680
I'm just winging it.

35:53.684 --> 35:56.710
But I love them, Jack.
You know that.

35:56.821 --> 35:59.346
I'm trying.

35:59.457 --> 36:01.186
Fair enough.

36:01.292 --> 36:04.125
You know, I would have given
anything to have somebody there

36:04.228 --> 36:05.718
to push me when I was Amy's age.

36:05.830 --> 36:07.855
My life might have turned out
a hell of a lot different

36:07.965 --> 36:10.798
if somebody was there
to guide me.

36:12.136 --> 36:13.103
You know it.

36:14.539 --> 36:15.938
I might have gone somewhere.

36:16.040 --> 36:19.840
Sometimes, Tim, these girls,
they don't want to "go" anywhere.

36:20.011 --> 36:21.569
You keep looking so far ahead,

36:21.679 --> 36:24.239
you miss seeing
where they're at right now.

36:29.320 --> 36:31.686
That's all I came here to say.

36:45.002 --> 36:46.663
Hey, boy.

36:47.305 --> 36:50.741
What am I going to do with you,
huh?

36:50.975 --> 36:52.602
Hey.

36:52.710 --> 36:53.642
How's Shorty?

36:53.744 --> 36:55.939
He's better.
Did that whole massage thing.

36:56.047 --> 36:58.607
Fed him some Valerian.
Chewed a bit myself.

36:58.716 --> 37:01.776
It's not bad.
I'm all mellow.

37:01.953 --> 37:03.511
But I got a deep,
dark secret for you.

37:03.621 --> 37:05.486
Oh, I already know
about Jennifer Love Hewitt.

37:05.590 --> 37:06.579
Not that.

37:06.724 --> 37:08.351
I talk to Shorty.

37:08.492 --> 37:09.857
No way.

37:09.961 --> 37:10.985
I do.

37:11.095 --> 37:13.962
And I think he understands me.

37:14.065 --> 37:16.329
Well, I won't tell anyone that,

37:16.434 --> 37:18.766
'cause, you know, people have
been kicked out of rodeo for less.

37:18.869 --> 37:21.201
For sure.

37:21.939 --> 37:23.167
You sure are happy today.

37:23.341 --> 37:26.799
Well, I've decided that I'm not going
to show jump anymore.

37:26.911 --> 37:29.402
You know, I'm just gonna keep him
and ride him for fun,

37:29.513 --> 37:30.605
but not compete.

37:33.384 --> 37:34.282
What?

37:36.087 --> 37:38.317
He's a show horse, right?
Bred for it.

37:38.422 --> 37:41.414
It's kind of cruel to keep a horse
from doing what it's meant to do.

37:41.525 --> 37:44.494
I mean, Shorty would be miserable
if he couldn't do what he likes to do.

37:44.595 --> 37:46.028
And what he likes to do
is bulldogging.

37:46.130 --> 37:50.624
I'd hate to think what'll happen
if he can't do that anymore.

37:58.643 --> 38:00.304
[Knocking on door]

38:01.846 --> 38:04.474
Okay, let's talk.
What's wrong?

38:04.582 --> 38:05.640
Nothing.

38:05.750 --> 38:08.651
I've just decided to live
a less-complicated life.

38:08.753 --> 38:10.516
More nomadic.

38:10.621 --> 38:12.282
Who needs clothes and stuff?

38:14.325 --> 38:15.417
What's wrong?

38:17.495 --> 38:18.519
Everything.

38:19.163 --> 38:20.152
Like what?

38:20.331 --> 38:22.356
Well, I had to beg you
to let me stay here, right?

38:22.466 --> 38:24.127
Yes, you did.

38:24.268 --> 38:28.102
And I just thought that I wouldn't
get homesick, but I am,

38:28.205 --> 38:31.732
and I thought I wasrt gonna
miss my parents, but I do,

38:31.842 --> 38:33.707
and I thought I was
just gonna totally fit in,

38:33.811 --> 38:35.745
but it's like no one even notices me.

38:35.846 --> 38:37.837
It's like I don't even have
a family anymore.

38:37.948 --> 38:39.245
Are you done?

38:43.120 --> 38:44.712
You have a family.

38:44.822 --> 38:46.289
And they can't wait
to talk to you.

38:46.390 --> 38:49.018
They've been phoning here nonstop.

38:49.126 --> 38:52.892
And you're definitely part
of this tribe, too.

38:52.997 --> 38:55.795
As soon as you start unpacking
your stuff here

38:55.900 --> 38:57.765
and make this room your own,

38:57.868 --> 38:59.836
the faster you'll start to feel
at home.

38:59.937 --> 39:00.904
So, get it done.

39:01.706 --> 39:03.367
I can make it my own?

39:03.474 --> 39:05.567
I can redecorate it?

39:05.676 --> 39:07.871
I thought it was, like, a shrine.

39:09.547 --> 39:12.141
Phone your parents now.

39:18.189 --> 39:21.249
I'm gonna regret that.

39:21.392 --> 39:23.917
Hi, Dad.

39:24.028 --> 39:26.895
Hi! I'm fine.

39:26.997 --> 39:30.592
Yeah. I get to redecorate my room.

39:30.768 --> 39:32.326
Okay.

39:32.436 --> 39:34.961
Yeah, I'll get back to you.
Thanks, Nick.

39:35.072 --> 39:35.868
Bye.

39:36.941 --> 39:38.636
Hey.

39:38.743 --> 39:40.074
Hey.

39:41.645 --> 39:43.909
That was Nick Harwell.

39:44.014 --> 39:46.005
He's offered to jump Storm for me,

39:46.117 --> 39:50.451
you know, take him on the circuit,
fulfill his potential.

39:50.554 --> 39:51.987
What do you think?

39:52.089 --> 39:53.647
I don't know.

39:53.758 --> 39:56.420
Might be the best of both worlds.

39:58.162 --> 40:00.562
Yeah.

40:00.664 --> 40:03.531
Yeah.

40:04.835 --> 40:09.101
I just don't think I could watch
someone else competing on him.

40:10.608 --> 40:12.473
I know it sounds selfish
or whatever,

40:12.576 --> 40:16.603
but I just love him too much
to share him.

40:19.817 --> 40:23.253
Nick offered to buy him.

40:25.956 --> 40:29.221
I think I have to sell him, Ty.

40:29.727 --> 40:31.888
I do.

40:40.738 --> 40:43.332
Are you sure you want to do this?

40:43.441 --> 40:45.341
They'll make a great team.

40:45.509 --> 40:47.636
I'll take care of him, Amy.
Don't you worry.

40:47.745 --> 40:50.873
- Okay.
- Come visit him anytime.

40:52.416 --> 40:53.906
Hey, boy.

40:54.018 --> 40:57.818
You gonna be a good boy for me?

41:12.870 --> 41:14.565
Hey, Dad.

41:14.672 --> 41:15.661
Hey.

41:18.108 --> 41:19.837
Um, about Storm...

41:19.944 --> 41:23.641
Oh, no, it's okay. I heard.
Nick called me.

41:24.215 --> 41:26.046
It was your decision to make,

41:26.150 --> 41:28.880
and I know how hard
that must have been for you.

41:28.986 --> 41:32.319
So whatever it is that you want
to do, Amy, I'm there for you.

41:32.456 --> 41:34.947
Thanks.

41:35.392 --> 41:36.484
I got your money.

41:36.594 --> 41:38.061
No.

41:38.162 --> 41:39.595
No, no, no.

41:39.697 --> 41:42.291
Storm was a gift.
That money is a gift.

41:42.399 --> 41:44.162
- Dad.
- Yeah.

41:45.803 --> 41:46.792
Okay.

41:48.205 --> 41:49.331
I love you.

41:50.241 --> 41:52.573
I love you, too.

42:00.317 --> 42:02.251
Amy, I can't take this from you.

42:03.053 --> 42:04.418
This was a gift from Dad to you.

42:04.522 --> 42:05.819
I'm not giving it to you, Lou.

42:05.923 --> 42:10.587
I'm investing it in your corporate,
equine-retreat thing.

42:10.694 --> 42:14.994
It may not be my kind of thing,
but you're gonna make it work.

42:16.734 --> 42:18.759
I'm expecting quarterly reports.

42:20.804 --> 42:23.364
Yeah, you probably are.

42:29.213 --> 42:30.237
I'm fine.

42:30.347 --> 42:33.282
It's unbelievable
how dysfunctional this family is.

42:33.384 --> 42:37.184
Yeah. They make us look normal.

42:37.421 --> 42:38.718
Guess what.

42:38.822 --> 42:40.722
Lou got my special bagels,

42:40.824 --> 42:43.657
so it's starting to feel
a lot more like home.

42:43.761 --> 42:46.855
Yeah, pretty much.

42:47.698 --> 42:49.791
Exactly what I was talking about.

42:49.900 --> 42:51.629
Good, honest riding horses.

42:52.136 --> 42:53.967
Solid and dependable.

42:54.071 --> 42:55.129
You mean old.

42:57.408 --> 42:58.807
Well, I wanted to come by
and make sure

42:58.909 --> 43:02.106
you got the best of the worst.

43:02.212 --> 43:04.840
I'm kidding.

43:05.983 --> 43:07.974
Honey, I want to be
your business partner.

43:08.085 --> 43:12.385
I made some mistakes,
but I'm 100% behind you.

43:13.691 --> 43:14.623
Deal.

43:14.725 --> 43:17.353
Provided you remember when it
comes to running this business,

43:17.461 --> 43:18.587
I'm the trail boss.

43:18.696 --> 43:20.926
Oh, you're the trail boss.

43:21.699 --> 43:25.328
So let's take a look
at these champions.

43:29.106 --> 43:30.971
I hope we can be partners, too.

43:33.577 --> 43:34.976
We need some alone time.

43:35.079 --> 43:37.809
I know. I'm sorry.

43:37.915 --> 43:40.349
I've been so consumed
by everything,

43:40.451 --> 43:41.748
and I don't know...

43:41.852 --> 43:43.717
Maybe once the dude ranch
is up and running...

43:43.821 --> 43:46.187
Yeah. You'll have all the time
in the world.

43:50.361 --> 43:52.886
Alone time. Say that.

43:54.264 --> 43:56.528
Alone time.
