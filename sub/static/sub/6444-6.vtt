00:06.680 --> 00:08.477
<i>Daily Planet</i> info line.

00:08.640 --> 00:11.598
Obituaries?
Yeah, sure, let me transfer...

00:11.760 --> 00:13.876
Oh, dog obituaries.

00:14.040 --> 00:16.713
Oh, I'm sorry.
We don't actually run those.

00:17.000 --> 00:18.991
Yeah, okay. You're welcome.

00:19.160 --> 00:21.276
Die! Die!

00:21.440 --> 00:23.829
Lois, I'm sorry you were in
for a girls' night <i>out...</i>

00:24.000 --> 00:27.310
...and I got called in to screen news
that's not fit to print.

00:27.480 --> 00:29.550
Compared to the Kent farm,
this is a rager.

00:30.400 --> 00:32.436
Besides,
I wouldn't pass up an <i>opportunity...</i>

00:32.600 --> 00:35.592
...to watch a big-shot reporter
in action.

00:36.200 --> 00:38.236
All right,
now that I'm swimming in <i>butter...</i>

00:38.400 --> 00:41.472
...why are you really here obliterating
aliens with me at 1 a. M?

00:41.640 --> 00:43.312
I'm racking up brownie points.

00:43.480 --> 00:46.278
I need you to help me move out
of the Kents' next weekend.

00:46.440 --> 00:48.032
You took the apartment
at the Talon?

00:48.200 --> 00:52.239
- How are you gonna live without Clark?
- One word: Blissfully.

00:52.400 --> 00:54.311
How you had a crush on
Richie Cunningham...

00:54.480 --> 00:55.754
...I will never understand.

00:55.920 --> 00:58.957
You gotta come back to Smallville.
It'll be fun. I'll buy pizza.

00:59.120 --> 01:00.599
You don't need to Tom Sawyer me.

01:00.760 --> 01:03.957
We're family.
Just tell me when to be there.

01:10.360 --> 01:13.511
- <i>Daily Planet</i> info line.
- I need a reporter to meet me.

01:14.120 --> 01:15.792
Who is this?

01:16.360 --> 01:17.634
<i>I wanna talk to a reporter.</i>

01:18.280 --> 01:20.714
You have to send someone fast,
before he finds me.

01:20.880 --> 01:24.714
Seventh and Edgemont.
Please, you've gotta hurry.

01:26.000 --> 01:32.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:35.200 --> 01:36.918
We couldn't have met
at a coffee shop?

01:37.080 --> 01:40.356
I don't think she was looking
for a brunch date, Lois.

01:40.520 --> 01:42.909
Sounds like a story
someone didn't want her to tell.

01:43.080 --> 01:45.071
I thought you were
supposed to pass leads...

01:45.240 --> 01:47.276
<i>...to</i> someone who's cubicle
is above ground.

01:47.440 --> 01:50.637
Well, unless I wanna stay subterranean,
I've gotta take a chance.

01:50.800 --> 01:52.870
Please! Help me!

01:53.040 --> 01:54.314
- There she is.
- Help!

01:56.040 --> 01:57.678
Over here!

02:14.440 --> 02:16.351
She's dead.

03:10.360 --> 03:14.399
So how much longer do I have you
before you hightail it back to Metropolis?

03:14.560 --> 03:16.790
Well, Lana's gone for the weekend.

03:16.960 --> 03:19.030
I lost out to a comet
her class is tracking...

03:19.200 --> 03:21.270
...at the Lincoln Observatory.

03:21.560 --> 03:23.516
How about Chloe or Lois?

03:23.680 --> 03:26.114
Well, chloe's juggling classes
and the <i>Daily Planet.</i>

03:26.280 --> 03:28.874
And Lois... I'd do anything
to get rid of Lois.

03:29.040 --> 03:31.838
I don't think that's exactly a prereq
for best-friend status.

03:32.000 --> 03:33.433
Well...

03:36.360 --> 03:38.078
Hold this.

03:45.000 --> 03:46.513
Dad.

03:55.800 --> 03:57.199
Is that the best you got?

03:57.600 --> 03:59.909
I had another six inches out here.

04:01.720 --> 04:04.359
I wasn't sure how rusty
your reflexes had gotten.

04:04.920 --> 04:06.831
Senator Jennings.

04:07.040 --> 04:11.113
I know it's been a long time,
but what happened to "Uncle Jack"?

04:11.280 --> 04:14.272
For someone who's on
a first-name basis with the governor?

04:17.440 --> 04:20.829
I don't remember the governor
winning a state football championship.

04:21.000 --> 04:22.513
- Congratulations.
- Thanks.

04:22.680 --> 04:24.830
Anybody push you
to follow in his footsteps?

04:25.000 --> 04:28.390
Hey, it's a lot better than spending
the games underneath the bleachers...

04:28.560 --> 04:30.437
<i>...with</i> the sheriff's daughters.

04:30.600 --> 04:32.636
Not both of them at once.

04:33.560 --> 04:36.757
Since when do you trek out here
in the middle of a campaign?

04:36.920 --> 04:38.353
Exactly why I came.

04:38.520 --> 04:40.750
I needed a breather from the rat race.

04:40.920 --> 04:44.151
Besides, I could use your help
rallying the farmers.

04:44.320 --> 04:46.038
You got a lot of pull
with that union.

04:46.200 --> 04:49.795
Why? You always win this county
by a landslide.

04:49.960 --> 04:52.554
Well,
the race is about to get a lot tougher.

04:52.840 --> 04:55.195
Rumor has it I'm running against
Lex Luthor.

05:01.000 --> 05:03.912
Let me get this straight.
No ID or make on the vehicle...

05:04.080 --> 05:07.914
...no ID on the driver,
and no clue why this girl called.

05:08.080 --> 05:11.755
I'd say you're off to a great start
as an investigative reporter, Ms. Sullivan.

05:11.920 --> 05:15.674
If you remember anything else,
let me know.

05:15.840 --> 05:19.355
I think that's code for,
"We're gonna file this under the rug."

05:22.760 --> 05:25.228
This is a big city,
and bad things happen.

05:25.400 --> 05:28.915
A pretty young girl, not in college,
with no traceable job...

05:29.080 --> 05:32.277
<i>...in</i> that part of town. It's not a mystery
what happened down there.

05:32.920 --> 05:35.912
You don't think it's strange
that an alleged streetwalker...

05:36.080 --> 05:38.310
...was wearing
$500 Jimmy Choo shoes?

05:40.640 --> 05:44.110
Look, Detective Sawyer,
this girl died trying to tell me her story.

05:44.280 --> 05:48.034
Now, I'm sorry I'm not street-hardened,
but she's more than a statistic to me.

05:48.200 --> 05:50.270
We have to find out who did this.

05:51.000 --> 05:52.718
I applaud your spirit, girls.

05:52.880 --> 05:56.395
But you should know that most of those
streets turn out to be dead ends.

05:56.560 --> 05:59.677
I will do my job, you do yours.

06:05.920 --> 06:08.673
Hopefully you'll have more luck
than Officer Stalin.

06:08.840 --> 06:10.956
I ran the number
that Melissa girl called from.

06:11.120 --> 06:13.156
It was from a payphone near
where we saw her.

06:13.320 --> 06:15.914
But the only addresses
within 10 blocks from the place...

06:16.080 --> 06:17.638
...was a bunch of warehouses.

06:23.000 --> 06:25.753
And a club called the Windgate.

06:27.720 --> 06:31.554
I'm guessing she didn't get
all glammed up to count inventory.

06:35.320 --> 06:37.595
So your dad outran four cop cars...

06:37.760 --> 06:40.274
...and pissed off half the farmers
in Chickasaw County.

06:40.440 --> 06:43.193
It's only because you said
that you knew a shortcut.

06:43.360 --> 06:45.555
These aren't the sides
of the story that I hear.

06:45.720 --> 06:48.234
Got any more? They're useful
when I'm in for a lecture.

06:48.400 --> 06:50.277
No, I don't think...

06:50.440 --> 06:53.716
Hang on. Don't you say anything else.
Just a second.

06:55.600 --> 06:57.397
Maggie Sawyer,
Metropolis P.D.

06:57.560 --> 06:58.834
- Hi.
- May I come in?

06:59.000 --> 07:02.515
- Yeah, sure, come on in.
- Thank you.

07:03.400 --> 07:04.992
Senator.

07:05.160 --> 07:07.993
Campaign headquarters said
I could find you here.

07:09.000 --> 07:10.672
What can I do for you?

07:10.840 --> 07:13.434
A young woman was killed last night.
Hit and run.

07:13.600 --> 07:16.353
We went through her apartment,
and we found this.

07:19.120 --> 07:21.839
Now, I don't have enough evidence
to bring you in...

07:22.000 --> 07:23.831
...but I would appreciate
an explanation.

07:24.000 --> 07:27.629
So would I.
I never seen her before.

07:28.480 --> 07:32.029
Well, that must have been tricky
while she was cuddled up on your lap.

07:34.480 --> 07:37.040
With all due respect, senator,
pictures don't lie.

07:39.440 --> 07:42.398
Hang on just a minute.
This day and age, they most certainly do.

07:46.240 --> 07:47.309
This picture's a fake.

07:47.920 --> 07:48.909
Doesn't matter.

07:49.080 --> 07:52.390
The minute it hits the press,
the damage is done.

07:52.560 --> 07:53.879
This could ruin me.

07:54.720 --> 07:57.154
So it looks like the mudslinging's
already started.

07:58.880 --> 08:01.952
Dad, do you really think
Lex would go this far?

08:02.280 --> 08:04.555
Come on, Clark,
you know Lex better than anybody.

08:04.720 --> 08:07.359
He's not gonna enter a race
unless he's sure he's gonna win.

08:12.360 --> 08:13.998
Is it true, Lex?

08:14.160 --> 08:16.196
You know,
after you've been MIA for <i>weeks...</i>

08:16.360 --> 08:19.238
<i>...I</i> don't think a hello
is too much to ask for.

08:19.880 --> 08:22.474
How long you been planning
to run for state senate?

08:22.640 --> 08:23.629
Several months now.

08:23.800 --> 08:25.711
If you're implying
I should've told <i>you...</i>

08:25.880 --> 08:28.872
...you might rethink the barrier
you've drawn in this friendship.

08:35.559 --> 08:38.357
I can't believe you'd destroy someone
just to win a race.

08:40.200 --> 08:44.034
There's a reason they call it a "race,"
not a "political potluck."

08:44.240 --> 08:46.549
But if you think
I had something to do with this...

08:46.720 --> 08:48.950
Your competition was linked
to a murder...

08:49.120 --> 08:51.031
...just before you announce
your candidacy.

08:51.480 --> 08:52.754
It's a bit of a coincidence.

08:53.400 --> 08:55.038
You don't recognize that picture?

08:55.200 --> 08:57.760
The only thing I recognize
is the booth.

08:58.000 --> 08:59.672
It's the Windgate Gentleman's club.

08:59.840 --> 09:02.559
Not a smart stop-off
for an incumbent on the campaign trail.

09:04.640 --> 09:07.996
I know this guy. If you're not trying
to set him up, somebody is.

09:08.160 --> 09:09.673
Maybe it's somebody at this club.

09:09.840 --> 09:13.196
Clark, there's a reason
that club's so underground.

09:13.360 --> 09:17.797
The city doesn't exactly give licenses
for some of the things that go on there.

09:18.120 --> 09:20.395
Are you sure
you wanna get involved in this?

09:23.520 --> 09:25.670
Jack's like an uncle to me.

09:26.280 --> 09:28.840
And in case you've forgotten,
that's what friends do.

09:33.040 --> 09:36.715
Look, if you're serious
about getting through that front door...

09:37.800 --> 09:41.076
...you're gonna need a little more
than your driver's license.

09:44.280 --> 09:46.794
Do me a favor.
Stay out of trouble.

10:00.480 --> 10:03.074
I guess even MapQuest
has its limitations.

10:03.240 --> 10:05.470
Do you get to this place
through a manhole cover?

10:05.640 --> 10:07.915
Or a big neon door.

10:08.080 --> 10:11.311
I'd say the Armani suit's
a dead giveaway.

10:11.760 --> 10:12.749
Baby.

10:13.360 --> 10:15.237
Hi!

10:15.520 --> 10:16.509
Sorry, girls.

10:16.680 --> 10:19.592
- Our friend's already in there.
- It's her only night in town.

10:19.760 --> 10:22.274
I promised I'd take her to
the hottest address. Please?

10:22.440 --> 10:23.793
It's a private club.

10:23.960 --> 10:26.838
I'm afraid this is as much of the place
as you're going to see.

10:49.120 --> 10:52.192
I don't like that. That <i>is...</i>

10:55.960 --> 10:59.999
This makes my Halloween
Heidi dirndl costume look tame.

11:00.600 --> 11:02.670
You think that Melissa girl
was a dancer here?

11:02.840 --> 11:04.114
I don't know.

11:04.280 --> 11:08.478
Jimmy Choos are a long way
from angel wings and fishnets.

11:08.640 --> 11:11.438
Excuse me. Hi.

11:11.600 --> 11:15.354
Do you guys know anything
about a woman named Melissa Page?

11:34.400 --> 11:37.233
People won't talk,
but records definitely will.

11:37.400 --> 11:40.073
If she worked here, she'll be on file.

11:43.160 --> 11:45.879
Joel, David, come on up.

11:48.920 --> 11:52.629
- Are you ladies lost?
- We were just looking for...

11:52.840 --> 11:56.037
Oh, don't be shy.
She's here to dance.

11:56.800 --> 11:58.597
Are you the replacement
Rocco sent over?

11:58.760 --> 12:01.957
Yeah, he really hated to see her go.

12:02.720 --> 12:05.837
Take your clothes off.
Let's see what you got.

12:16.400 --> 12:19.278
- I knocked. I guess you didn't hear.
- Oh, I heard you.

12:19.440 --> 12:20.953
I'm here to see Senator Jennings.

12:21.120 --> 12:22.599
Lex, if you wanna sling mud...

12:22.760 --> 12:25.593
...I strongly recommend you do it
at somebody else's house.

12:25.760 --> 12:28.638
Don't worry,
I'm not holding my breath for your vote.

12:30.040 --> 12:32.508
You know, I've never liked you
all that much, Lex...

12:32.680 --> 12:35.797
<i>...but</i> even I'm surprised by the depths
you're willing to sink to.

12:35.960 --> 12:38.793
I'm sure you have such a good view
of it all from your pulpit.

12:39.720 --> 12:41.597
Holier-than-thou is an easy fallback.

12:41.760 --> 12:44.069
Keeps you from really looking
at people around you.

12:44.240 --> 12:45.559
I've known Jack for 25 years.

12:45.720 --> 12:47.995
I've never had a more
trustworthy or loyal friend.

12:48.160 --> 12:50.196
This state needs somebody like him.

12:50.360 --> 12:52.430
Somebody who's willing
to stand by their word.

12:52.600 --> 12:55.239
Somebody who's willing
to do what's right for <i>everybody...</i>

12:55.400 --> 12:56.913
...not just for himself.

12:57.840 --> 13:00.400
Somebody who's willing
to go up against people like you.

13:02.600 --> 13:04.989
Well, if you know him so well...

13:05.160 --> 13:08.550
...maybe you should ask
your good old boy to explain this to you.

13:11.760 --> 13:13.034
After clark's <i>visit...</i>

13:13.200 --> 13:16.590
<i>...I</i> decided to look into the senator's
unfortunate snapshot myself.

13:16.760 --> 13:18.352
It's his cell-phone record.

13:18.520 --> 13:20.875
Seems he's been calling his
dead stripper friend...

13:21.040 --> 13:22.678
...a little more than frequently.

13:28.360 --> 13:30.396
When are you releasing this?

13:30.640 --> 13:32.437
I'm not.

13:32.600 --> 13:36.036
But if I found it, you know the press
won't be far behind.

13:36.760 --> 13:38.512
I thought he'd like a heads-up.

13:53.240 --> 13:54.673
Lois, are you almost done?

13:54.840 --> 13:56.671
You didn't have that much to put on.

13:56.840 --> 13:58.592
Remind me when all this is over...

13:58.760 --> 14:00.671
...to never, ever
ask a favor of you again.

14:00.840 --> 14:03.479
This isn't just about me.
This is about getting the truth.

14:04.640 --> 14:06.551
Well, the last girl
that knew the truth...

14:06.720 --> 14:08.995
...ended up as a hood ornament
on someone's car.

14:14.560 --> 14:16.118
Howdy.

14:18.480 --> 14:21.233
You know, my friend's really excited
about working here...

14:21.400 --> 14:24.039
<i>...but</i> I think it's kind of dangerous.

14:24.200 --> 14:27.988
Especially after that girl
was killed and everything.

14:29.040 --> 14:30.996
How can I explain this to you?

14:31.400 --> 14:34.392
Don't talk to me.
Don't talk to any of us.

14:36.240 --> 14:37.753
Well?

14:40.560 --> 14:42.278
What do you think?

14:42.560 --> 14:43.834
All I can say is...

14:45.320 --> 14:48.039
...God bless America.

15:12.120 --> 15:15.351
Good evening.
First time at the Windgate?

15:15.520 --> 15:17.033
Yeah, Lex Luthor referred me.

15:18.560 --> 15:20.551
Will Mr. Luthor be joining you
this evening?

15:20.880 --> 15:22.313
No.

15:24.080 --> 15:25.911
I'm meeting Jack Jennings.

15:26.080 --> 15:28.878
The senator?
Let me show you to his usual table.

15:37.240 --> 15:38.912
- On second thought, l...
- No, no, no.

15:39.080 --> 15:40.911
Thinking bad, dancing good.

15:41.720 --> 15:44.757
Just ask Mr. Shoot-First-Think-Later
over there.

15:45.880 --> 15:49.555
Now, I need you to dig deep down
and find your inner Demi Moore.

15:53.840 --> 15:55.398
- Okay?
- Okay.

15:55.680 --> 16:00.037
You better at least use this distraction
to find something about Melissa.

16:12.520 --> 16:13.794
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

16:13.960 --> 16:16.235
You're welcome. Have a good evening.

16:19.560 --> 16:21.278
Hey, handsome,
what can I get for you?

16:25.360 --> 16:27.316
I'll have a coke.

16:28.800 --> 16:31.234
Straight up, on the rocks.

16:37.000 --> 16:41.152
<i>Gentlemen,</i>
<i>let's give Colette a nice</i> au revoir.

16:41.480 --> 16:44.472
<i>And now, making her first</i>
<i>Windgate appearance...</i>

16:45.000 --> 16:46.592
<i>... welcome to the stage...</i>

16:46.760 --> 16:50.435
<i>... all-American girl Amber Waves.</i>

17:59.200 --> 18:00.792
Bravo.

18:01.000 --> 18:02.752
Bravo.

18:21.800 --> 18:24.234
<i>I'd salute to that anytime.</i>

18:24.400 --> 18:27.198
<i>Let's give it up</i>
<i>for our red-blooded recruit.</i>

18:27.360 --> 18:29.954
<i>And now, let's give a good</i>
<i>homegrown welcome...</i>

18:30.640 --> 18:33.359
<i>... to Dixie.</i>

18:41.240 --> 18:44.073
- What are you doing here?
- What are you doing here?

18:57.640 --> 19:00.438
It's chloe's fault.
We're following a murder story.

19:00.600 --> 19:04.229
Well, that makes two of us.
But I think I'll stick to my method.

19:11.320 --> 19:14.835
You're gonna get me fired if you keep
looking at me like I'm Jabba the Hutt.

19:15.000 --> 19:16.672
What do you want me to do?

19:18.360 --> 19:21.909
I don't know.
Give me a 20 and meet me out back.

19:37.440 --> 19:40.671
Bravo. That new girl, who is she?
I want her.

19:40.840 --> 19:42.796
<i>I don 't know, she's new.</i>

19:42.960 --> 19:45.838
<i>For 500K, you know</i>
<i>I don 't ask any questions of my girls.</i>

19:46.000 --> 19:48.798
<i>And for that much</i>
<i>you better not answer any, either.</i>

19:52.520 --> 19:54.238
Everybody, freeze!

19:54.400 --> 19:57.551
Metropolis P.D.
Everybody, take it easy.

19:57.720 --> 20:01.599
We have a report of minors working
and being served in this establishment.

20:01.760 --> 20:03.591
We'll be interviewing you
individually.

20:03.760 --> 20:06.433
- Come on.
- What?

20:06.600 --> 20:10.479
Do you want to stick around
and get arrested? Come on.

20:17.280 --> 20:20.113
Really wrong time
and really wrong place, kid.

20:20.280 --> 20:22.236
You're under arrest.

20:28.960 --> 20:30.075
What is this about?

20:30.240 --> 20:32.629
We had a tip that a car
involved in a hit-and-run...

20:32.800 --> 20:34.552
...was seen leaving
your establishment.

20:34.720 --> 20:37.359
- You can't just arrest...
- The city's looked the other way.

20:37.520 --> 20:39.431
Your clientele can pull a lot of strings.

20:39.600 --> 20:42.717
Now I've got a dead 19-year-old
on my hands. I gotta go by the book.

20:42.880 --> 20:46.395
Okay, people, listen up.
I know that it's 5:00 in the morning.

20:46.560 --> 20:48.949
Your cooperation would be
greatly appreciated.

20:49.120 --> 20:50.838
Thank you.

20:51.040 --> 20:52.632
All right, ladies.

20:56.320 --> 20:57.639
- Clark?
- Chloe.

20:57.800 --> 20:59.199
- Where's Lois?
- I don't know.

20:59.360 --> 21:01.954
What are you...?
Clark, what are you doing here?

21:02.320 --> 21:03.594
Clark!

21:10.240 --> 21:12.310
What do you wanna know?
Maybe I can help you.

21:12.480 --> 21:14.869
<i>You're the bouncer.</i>
<i>You know everything that goes on.</i>

21:15.040 --> 21:16.951
- <i>Cut me a deal.</i>
<i>- Tell me about Jennings.</i>

21:17.120 --> 21:18.678
<i>He was drunk. I took him home.</i>

21:18.840 --> 21:22.230
<i>He had nothing to do with the girl.</i>
<i>He's innocent.</i>

21:25.360 --> 21:28.989
Wow, these are...
They're heavier than they look.

21:30.360 --> 21:33.557
They're way better than the heels,
trust me.

21:33.720 --> 21:37.315
So you guys must have been
pretty close with Melissa, huh?

21:38.520 --> 21:40.954
Sorry, okay. Premature segue.

21:41.120 --> 21:43.236
Come on, we're obviously
on the same side here.

21:43.400 --> 21:45.197
I just wanna know
what happened to her.

21:45.360 --> 21:47.316
It's a tragedy is what it is.

21:47.480 --> 21:49.596
She finally gets her shot
at Prince Charming...

21:49.760 --> 21:51.398
...and, wham, bye-bye, ivory tower.

21:51.960 --> 21:53.313
Are you talking about the senator?

21:53.480 --> 21:56.677
No way. The only thing he did wrong
was fall for her.

21:56.840 --> 21:59.070
There's this suave guy,
kind of Euro-Iooking.

21:59.240 --> 22:01.515
- What'd he want with Melissa?
- Every few months...

22:01.680 --> 22:04.114
...he picks some lucky girl
and takes her out of this dump.

22:04.280 --> 22:07.352
Probably to some tropical island
somewhere.

22:08.360 --> 22:10.669
You know why they invented fairy tales?

22:10.840 --> 22:14.116
Because no one wants to face reality.

22:14.280 --> 22:19.274
All we know is that the girls disappear,
and then no one ever sees them again.

22:20.480 --> 22:22.710
Somebody should've warned your friend
about that.

22:22.880 --> 22:24.074
- Lois?
- Yeah.

22:24.240 --> 22:26.231
I saw her leave with him
during the raid.

22:26.440 --> 22:28.112
Sullivan.

22:28.640 --> 22:30.596
Let's go.

22:33.040 --> 22:36.396
You can thank Lex Luthor
for some very generous phone calls.

22:36.560 --> 22:39.597
Detective Sawyer, I think the guy
that killed Melissa Page has my cousin.

22:39.760 --> 22:42.877
It's the same guy who made some deal
with the club owner before she vanished.

22:43.040 --> 22:44.519
Do you know this guy's name?

22:46.000 --> 22:47.638
Let me see if I'm understanding you.

22:47.800 --> 22:49.791
Your cousin,
who I'm assuming is <i>underage...</i>

22:49.960 --> 22:52.315
...was stripping and making deals
with wealthy patrons.

22:52.480 --> 22:55.040
- Managed to escape a police raid...
- It's not like that.

22:55.200 --> 22:57.839
- She was just helping me to investigate.
- Investigate?

22:58.960 --> 23:02.475
Okay, Luthor may have pulled a
get-out-of-jail-free card for you this time...

23:02.640 --> 23:04.358
...but it will not happen again.

23:04.520 --> 23:06.556
If you wanna play
Nancy Drew and Hardy Boy...

23:06.720 --> 23:08.870
<i>...do</i> it in someone else's precinct.

23:17.120 --> 23:20.874
Look, if I don't change my stance
just because some poll tells me to...

23:21.040 --> 23:24.112
...I am certainly not going to
because some journalist hears a rumor.

23:24.280 --> 23:26.999
Okay, Jordan? Goodbye.

23:36.640 --> 23:38.517
You just could not resist, could you?

23:39.360 --> 23:42.750
You still have a nasty habit
of leaving your keys in the ignition.

23:45.000 --> 23:46.274
Get in.

23:46.720 --> 23:48.358
With you at the wheel?

23:48.520 --> 23:52.035
I guess it wouldn't be the first time
I put my life in your hands.

23:57.920 --> 24:02.152
What? Damn thing's been stuck
ever since I bought it.

24:28.360 --> 24:31.113
Try that with a four-cylinder.

24:31.520 --> 24:33.351
So, what's the real reason
for the joyride?

24:33.520 --> 24:36.353
When were you gonna tell me
about the girl, Jack?

24:36.520 --> 24:38.829
You think I had something to do
with what happened?

24:39.000 --> 24:40.228
I have no idea.

24:40.400 --> 24:42.994
But I do think it's time you gave me
some straight answers.

24:45.800 --> 24:47.995
Look, I didn't want you to be involved.

24:48.160 --> 24:50.628
There's only so much
you should ask of a friend.

24:52.560 --> 24:56.075
- So instead you lie to my face...
- Well, what do you want me to say?

24:56.240 --> 24:58.276
That my marriage is
more of a business arrangement?

24:58.480 --> 25:01.552
And the only person who makes me
happy is some dancer half my age?

25:01.720 --> 25:04.757
- How much of it do you understand?
- I might not understand any of it.

25:04.960 --> 25:08.270
But come on, all of our lives
have taken turns that we didn't expect.

25:08.480 --> 25:10.869
You've never had a lie get out of hand?

25:11.040 --> 25:12.678
Or you've never been caught at it?

25:19.560 --> 25:22.791
I've never been in a position
where people look up to me.

25:23.720 --> 25:24.994
You are clark's hero.

25:25.200 --> 25:28.795
Oh, so I'm not supposed to have
any faults, huh? Who can live up to that?

25:29.280 --> 25:31.748
You know why there's no heroes today?

25:31.920 --> 25:35.276
Because at the end of the day, people
don't respect them, they envy them.

25:35.440 --> 25:38.716
- They're waiting for them to screw up.
- What are you gonna do, Jack?

25:41.360 --> 25:44.750
What do you want me to do?
I'm a good senator.

25:44.920 --> 25:47.309
You wanna give that kind of power
to somebody like Lex Luthor?

25:47.520 --> 25:51.308
I might not agree with Lex Luthor's
politics, but at least I know who he is.

26:09.440 --> 26:12.398
- Nice place you got.
- Thank you.

26:12.560 --> 26:14.790
Well,
thanks for helping me out back there.

26:14.960 --> 26:16.791
My pleasure.

26:20.120 --> 26:23.669
I think I have something
a little more your size.

26:35.480 --> 26:38.517
I won't peek. I promise.

26:53.680 --> 26:55.398
Melissa.

26:58.400 --> 27:00.550
You want me to help you tie it?

27:00.720 --> 27:03.678
Oh, no, that's fine.

27:03.840 --> 27:05.717
Almost got it.

27:16.920 --> 27:18.831
What you doing there?

27:23.280 --> 27:29.116
It looks so much better on you
than any of the others.

27:29.480 --> 27:32.756
You're going to make them
very jealous.

27:33.400 --> 27:36.392
You know,
I think I'm just gonna call a cab.

27:40.720 --> 27:44.508
Think of your taxi days
as a thing of the past.

27:45.280 --> 27:48.431
You have a whole new life
ahead of you now.

27:49.480 --> 27:51.789
I don't know what kind of kink
you're into, but...

27:58.520 --> 28:02.479
You are seriously behind
on your Gloria Steinem.

28:10.880 --> 28:11.869
Yeah, that's fine.

28:12.040 --> 28:15.112
The owner of the Windgate is selling
his strippers to the highest bidder?

28:15.280 --> 28:17.874
It's Kansas, it's definitely not Smallville.

28:18.040 --> 28:20.759
Five hundred grand
for a massage with benefits is a lot.

28:20.920 --> 28:23.912
- Do you know anything else?
- The bouncer told Detective Sawyer...

28:24.080 --> 28:26.275
...the guy was the son
of some foreign diplomat.

28:26.440 --> 28:27.953
Then he'd have diplomatic plates.

28:28.120 --> 28:30.839
See, while you were inside,
I was out in the parking lot...

28:31.000 --> 28:33.434
...taking shots of the license plates
of all the cars.

28:33.600 --> 28:35.238
- Here we go.
- Okay, check that one.

28:41.840 --> 28:43.512
That's the U.N. Tower.

28:59.480 --> 29:01.277
Lois?

29:13.640 --> 29:15.631
- Chloe Sullivan.
- <i>He's got Lois.</i>

29:15.840 --> 29:17.910
Any psychic guesses on this guy's
computer password?

29:18.120 --> 29:21.954
God, don't even try. He's probably got
like a zillion layers of security on it.

29:22.120 --> 29:24.031
It's still warm.
They must have just left.

29:24.840 --> 29:28.549
- The printer's still on.
- Try pressing print again.

29:35.080 --> 29:36.911
Chloe, it's a fake passport for Lois.

29:37.120 --> 29:39.509
<i>Think they're gonna try to smuggle her</i>
<i>out of the country?</i>

29:39.680 --> 29:42.831
Even if he does, I doubt he'll take her
through an airport.

29:45.000 --> 29:47.992
Clark, there's a helipad on the roof.

30:07.360 --> 30:09.954
We're stuck on something.

30:25.640 --> 30:28.154
Hey, 007. Nice of you to show up.

30:31.000 --> 30:33.230
I'll start assuming
that means thank you.

30:40.360 --> 30:42.954
Looks like it got caught on the cable.

30:44.760 --> 30:46.591
This scumbag
was about to air-cargo me...

30:46.760 --> 30:49.035
...to the honeymoon suite
at the Grope-a-cabana.

30:49.680 --> 30:51.716
I'm glad you're all right.

30:52.960 --> 30:56.999
Now, if you will release him,
I'm afraid Mr. Lyon is free to go.

30:57.160 --> 30:58.513
What?

30:59.560 --> 31:01.551
You can't just let him walk away.

31:01.720 --> 31:03.631
Diplomatic immunity.

31:03.800 --> 31:06.075
As a consulate guest in our country...

31:06.240 --> 31:10.438
<i>...Mr.</i> Lyon can't be arrested or tried
for any crime he commits on our soil.

31:11.200 --> 31:14.317
Even murder.
I'm sorry, I can't touch him.

31:15.640 --> 31:17.471
Well, I can.

31:29.520 --> 31:31.112
Some people live above the rules.

31:31.280 --> 31:33.475
Guess what. That's life in Metropolis.

31:33.640 --> 31:35.312
You want justice...

31:35.480 --> 31:37.948
...I suggest you stay
a little closer to home.

31:55.520 --> 31:56.794
We'll finish this later.

31:56.960 --> 31:58.871
- All right.
- Yes, sir.

32:00.720 --> 32:02.790
I just wanna say thank you.

32:03.920 --> 32:07.230
When I asked you to stay out of trouble,
I thought that might include...

32:07.400 --> 32:09.834
...being caught at a strip club
using my membership...

32:10.000 --> 32:11.797
...while I'm gearing up
for a campaign.

32:11.960 --> 32:15.839
- I didn't mean to drag you into this.
- Come on, Clark, who you kidding?

32:16.000 --> 32:19.834
You had me masterminding this plot
before you walked through those doors.

32:20.040 --> 32:24.318
- I didn't think he was lying to me.
- But you assumed I would.

32:25.720 --> 32:27.950
I can't believe that I looked up to Jack.

32:33.080 --> 32:35.640
Tell me what you remember
about King David.

32:35.800 --> 32:37.358
Humor me.

32:38.480 --> 32:40.152
King David.

32:40.400 --> 32:42.152
He slew Goliath, saved his people.

32:42.320 --> 32:43.833
And afterward...

32:44.000 --> 32:48.312
...he saw a beautiful woman bathing
and fell madly in love.

32:48.520 --> 32:52.149
Problem was, she turned out to be
his best friend's wife.

32:55.360 --> 32:57.828
So you know what our great hero did?

32:58.200 --> 33:01.909
He sent his best friend off to die in battle
so he could have her to himself.

33:04.400 --> 33:06.630
Kind of leave that part out, don't they?

33:09.680 --> 33:12.672
We all need to believe in heroes, Clark.

33:13.120 --> 33:16.749
And even the best ones
are far from perfect.

33:36.320 --> 33:38.788
Surprised to see your car out front.

33:39.400 --> 33:42.039
I thought you'd be gone
now that you're clear of murder.

33:42.200 --> 33:44.873
I've been mulling over
some pretty tough decisions.

33:45.040 --> 33:48.510
This seemed like a good place
to get my bearings again.

33:49.600 --> 33:51.431
Have you talked to my dad yet?

33:51.600 --> 33:53.955
I'd say he did most of the talking.

33:54.120 --> 33:58.432
After 20 years, the man's still got a hell
of a knack for the guilt trip, doesn't he?

33:58.960 --> 34:01.349
Usually works because he's right.

34:02.880 --> 34:06.953
Your father's always had pretty high
expectations of the people around him.

34:07.120 --> 34:09.235
He's the one man
I never wanted to disappoint.

34:10.440 --> 34:11.998
You should try being his son.

34:13.199 --> 34:16.829
The thing I always try to remember is,
no matter how much he lays on...

34:17.520 --> 34:19.909
...he never expects
more than he expects of himself.

34:21.159 --> 34:23.150
You think your dad
will ever forgive me?

34:25.320 --> 34:28.869
Yeah, I've given him a lot of trial runs
in the forgiveness arena.

34:34.400 --> 34:37.312
Look, I know my dad's friendship
means a lot to you...

34:38.679 --> 34:42.355
<i>...but</i> there's a lot of other people
out there who look up to you.

34:42.719 --> 34:46.871
I guess you can only pull off the disguise
of being superhuman for so long, huh?

34:50.480 --> 34:51.913
What are you gonna do?

34:54.639 --> 34:56.755
I've called a press conference.

34:56.920 --> 34:58.194
I'm pulling out of the race.

35:16.920 --> 35:20.037
Going back to the city, facing
all those reporters takes a lot of guts.

35:20.200 --> 35:22.156
After facing you...

35:22.320 --> 35:26.836
...live feeds and bloodthirsty journalists
are a walk in the park.

35:27.520 --> 35:32.275
Look, if we let a couple of rough days
destroy over 25 years of friendship...

35:32.440 --> 35:35.512
<i>...then</i> I guess we weren't
as good of friends as I thought we were.

35:37.560 --> 35:39.471
Jack,
if you're pulling out of this <i>race...</i>

35:39.640 --> 35:42.677
...because your old buddy
can't seem to climb off of his <i>pulpit...</i>

35:42.840 --> 35:46.435
...that's not what I wanted.
All I really ask is that you be honest.

35:47.120 --> 35:50.556
I'm pulling out of the race because
I'm no longer the best man for the job.

35:51.800 --> 35:53.756
Are you sure?

35:53.920 --> 35:56.798
If you wanna hang in there and fight,
I'll be behind you 100 percent.

35:57.040 --> 35:58.519
I know.

35:58.960 --> 36:02.555
But all those things you said
about me being loyal and trustworthy...

36:02.720 --> 36:05.109
...and willing to take on
the Luthors of the world...

36:05.280 --> 36:08.636
I might have been that man once,
but I have to step aside...

36:08.800 --> 36:11.872
...when I see somebody
who still embodies all those qualities.

36:12.040 --> 36:14.873
Jack, you can't seriously
be talking about Lex Luthor.

36:15.640 --> 36:17.437
I'm talking about you, Jon.

36:19.640 --> 36:22.552
Kansas could use a senator like you.

36:22.720 --> 36:24.073
You should think about it.

36:43.480 --> 36:44.754
Hey, Smallville.

36:44.920 --> 36:47.195
Your personal space
is about to be reinstated.

36:47.360 --> 36:49.112
What are you doing?
You just moved back in.

36:49.280 --> 36:52.317
Well, now that Lana's living with chloe,
I'm taking the place.

36:54.200 --> 36:56.031
You don't have a key to the apartment,
do you?

36:56.200 --> 36:59.112
You know,
now that you two have been doing it.

36:59.280 --> 37:00.838
- No, we...
- Good.

37:01.000 --> 37:03.195
I wouldn't want
any surprise midnight visits.

37:03.920 --> 37:06.195
Anything I can do
to make this move go faster?

37:06.360 --> 37:07.839
Pack your three closets of clothing?

37:08.000 --> 37:10.560
Burn your loofa? Take your
Whitesnake collection to Goodwill?

37:10.720 --> 37:12.278
You can take this.

37:12.440 --> 37:14.908
Come on, Smallville. Move it.

37:28.200 --> 37:31.829
You know, this is weird.
I've spent so much time here with Lana.

37:32.000 --> 37:34.514
Clark, it's not like I'm taking her place,
just her sublet.

37:34.680 --> 37:37.911
Okay, before I start
any of the real heavy lifting...

37:38.080 --> 37:40.355
...you have to indulge me
for just a moment...

37:40.520 --> 37:43.910
...in my first <i>Daily Planet</i> byline.

37:47.960 --> 37:50.758
It's not exactly the <i>Torch,</i> clark.
Page 73.

37:54.880 --> 37:55.949
At the bottom.

38:01.480 --> 38:03.311
- Congratulations.
- Congratulations.

38:05.560 --> 38:07.278
Thanks, you deserve half the credit.

38:07.480 --> 38:11.029
I'd still be playing point guard at the pet
obituary hotline if it weren't for you two.

38:11.240 --> 38:13.549
Oh, it says here
Interpol was able to arrest him...

38:13.720 --> 38:15.631
...due to an anonymous tip.

38:17.520 --> 38:19.909
About that heavy lifting...

38:25.040 --> 38:26.837
Clark?

38:28.840 --> 38:32.150
Look, I'm not great at this, so just
keep your mouth shut and listen up.

38:33.640 --> 38:35.949
Even though I was kicking butt
on the helicopter...

38:36.120 --> 38:37.633
...it was nice to have backup.

38:37.800 --> 38:40.792
And you didn't have to come after me,
but you always do.

38:40.960 --> 38:44.191
So I wanted to say thank you.
You're a really good friend.

38:45.640 --> 38:48.108
Oh, and about the lap dance?

38:48.280 --> 38:50.874
If you decide to tell anybody about it...

38:51.040 --> 38:54.589
...your Elmer Fudd night-light
will make a very public appearance.

38:58.000 --> 38:59.831
Aye, aye...

39:00.760 --> 39:02.398
...sailor.
