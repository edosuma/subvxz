00:02.136 --> 00:04.444
Hello. If it's all right
with everyone,

00:04.478 --> 00:07.456
I'd like to begin this morning's
rounds with a joke. Denise.

00:07.490 --> 00:09.163
Mm, I don't really have one.

00:09.197 --> 00:11.237
<i>No, I meant that you
were the joke.</i>

00:11.272 --> 00:12.609
Oh... Good one.

00:12.644 --> 00:14.616
Thanks. I thought of it
this morning

00:14.652 --> 00:17.227
While I was watching you
try to jam a catheter

00:17.261 --> 00:19.570
Into mr. Hazleton.
Yeah, he was a screamer.

00:19.604 --> 00:20.908
(laughs) aah, aah!

00:20.943 --> 00:21.946
What's your name?

00:21.980 --> 00:24.590
I'm sonia, but everybody
calls me sunny.

00:24.624 --> 00:27.601
Is it because of your haunting
resemblance to sonny bono?

00:27.636 --> 00:28.773
Who's that?

00:28.807 --> 00:30.714
Moving on
to our next patient.

00:30.748 --> 00:33.591
Mr. Francone has been in a coma
for well over a year.

00:33.626 --> 00:35.566
His organs are starting
to fail,

00:35.600 --> 00:39.281
And he probably won't be
with us very much longer.

00:39.315 --> 00:41.288
The most important thing
to remember

00:41.323 --> 00:43.029
During his final hours
here on earth is

00:43.063 --> 00:46.308
<i>Do not ever come to me
and ask me questions</i>

00:46.342 --> 00:48.249
About how to treat him.

00:48.283 --> 00:50.357
He's a potato.

00:50.391 --> 00:52.934
If you do, my answer
will always be the same--

00:52.969 --> 00:54.340
Sour cream, chives,

00:54.374 --> 00:56.983
And if I haven't had
any protein that day,

00:57.017 --> 00:59.928
Maybe just a sprinkling
of some of those bacon bits.

00:59.962 --> 01:03.911
Oh, my god.
His hand--it--it moved.

01:03.945 --> 01:05.147
Kidding.

01:05.183 --> 01:07.725
(whispers)
the man's a potato.

01:09.232 --> 01:12.644
Um, dr. Reid, no offense,
but have you been drinking?

01:12.679 --> 01:16.091
Oh, no. I read that shampooing
with beer is good for your hair.

01:16.125 --> 01:18.567
So I'm all sudsed up
in the shower this morning,

01:18.603 --> 01:21.613
And the hot water dies, so now
I've gotta spend the entire day

01:21.647 --> 01:24.056
Smelling like a brewery,
because there is no way

01:24.091 --> 01:26.566
That I'm going to rinse off
with ice water.

01:26.600 --> 01:28.875
You see, this dress
only works without a bra,

01:28.910 --> 01:31.921
So if I get cold, it looks
like I'm smuggling candy corns.

01:31.955 --> 01:33.559
Hi, peggy,
this is dr. Mahoney.

01:33.594 --> 01:36.572
She's gonna help me
take care of you.
What's that smell?

01:36.606 --> 01:39.115
It's my hair, okay? Peggy's got
a touch of pneumonia,

01:39.150 --> 01:41.993
But she's gonna pull through.
I wish my husband was here.

01:42.027 --> 01:44.536
He passed away
several months ago.
That sucks.

01:44.571 --> 01:46.076
It totally sucks.

01:46.110 --> 01:48.786
We were together
for 53 years.

01:48.821 --> 01:51.229
I'm sorry, peggy.
Is it cold in here?

01:51.263 --> 01:53.204
'cause it just feels
a little freezing.

01:53.238 --> 01:56.081
Um, I'm just gonna
go get a sweatshirt.

01:56.116 --> 01:58.023
I don't know. Just hearing

01:58.057 --> 02:00.900
About how much that old patient
missed her husband

02:00.934 --> 02:02.205
Made me think of you.

02:02.240 --> 02:05.184
Aw. And a deep, wet
tongue kiss right back at you.

02:05.218 --> 02:07.159
(makes kissing sound)

02:07.193 --> 02:10.771
Is that j.D.?
No, it's my dad.

02:10.806 --> 02:13.215
Of course it was j.D.
Oh, that's good.

02:13.249 --> 02:15.223
That old broad
and her dead husband

02:15.257 --> 02:17.632
Got my engine revving, too.
I need some action.

02:17.667 --> 02:19.574
Luckily, cheeseburger day
at the caf

02:19.608 --> 02:22.385
Really brings out
the fatties.
Denise likes the big fellas.

02:22.419 --> 02:24.861
<i>Oh, check out the ripples
on that gentleman.</i>

02:24.895 --> 02:28.174
Ooh, it's like somebody
threw a boulder in a pond.

02:28.208 --> 02:30.483
Fat dudes rule.
They never expect commitment,

02:30.518 --> 02:32.558
<i>And they try so hard
in the sack.</i>

02:32.592 --> 02:35.034
Plus, they're just so grateful
afterwards.

02:35.068 --> 02:38.347
Mm. Well, I'm just gonna
put this out here for bait

02:38.382 --> 02:41.694
And see what ambles
out of the forest.
Gooch!

02:41.728 --> 02:44.605
I forgot to tell you,
I have a girlfriend now.

02:44.639 --> 02:46.480
Stephanie gooch,

02:46.514 --> 02:48.621
This is elliott,

02:48.655 --> 02:52.637
And this is some girl
who digs fat guys.

02:52.671 --> 02:55.816
Come on, gooch, there's, like,
75 other people you haven't met

02:55.850 --> 02:57.857
Who don't believe you exist.

02:57.892 --> 03:00.801
Hey, miguel!
This is the girlfriend,

03:00.837 --> 03:02.441
<i>And she is real.</i>

03:02.476 --> 03:04.081
In yo' face!

03:05.990 --> 03:07.361
Baby, baby, baby, baby,

03:07.396 --> 03:09.837
I was pulling
some dude's spleen out today,

03:09.872 --> 03:12.347
And check it--
blood splashed on my scrubs.

03:12.381 --> 03:14.790
It looks like a tiger!
(growls)

03:14.824 --> 03:18.939
Why is that rt
a different color?
I might've used chocolate
pudding to do the tail.

03:18.975 --> 03:22.587
That's awesome, turk, but, um,
I have to tell you something.
What's up?

03:22.622 --> 03:25.198
I'm pregnant.
What? I knew it!

03:25.232 --> 03:27.774
'cause these past
couple of months,

03:27.808 --> 03:30.586
Your butt's
been like... Pow!
It's only been two weeks.

03:30.620 --> 03:32.493
Baby, this is g news,

03:32.527 --> 03:34.936
And I want to talk to you
about it. I do.

03:34.970 --> 03:37.713
First, I gotta go
to the bathroom.
It's too soon,
so don't tell anyone.

03:37.747 --> 03:40.725
Why would you even think
I would do something like that?

03:40.759 --> 03:43.068
J.D.! I've got news!

03:43.102 --> 03:45.945
J.D.! Where are you, friend?

03:45.981 --> 03:47.652
(shoes squeaking)

03:47.687 --> 03:49.426
You seen j.D.?

03:49.461 --> 03:52.472
No, I have not.
Would you like to know why?

03:52.506 --> 03:54.379
He isn't coming in today.

03:54.413 --> 03:56.788
He's on a mini vacation,
and it isn't just today.

03:56.822 --> 03:58.729
He's not coming in tomorrow,

03:58.764 --> 04:02.008
Which, by the way,
is my day off, but not anymore.

04:02.043 --> 04:04.485
I am coming in early
and I'm staying late,

04:04.520 --> 04:06.527
Emprano y me iré tarde
because life is
too darn short

04:06.561 --> 04:08.835
To spend the day bonding
with my family

04:08.869 --> 04:11.279
When I could be roaming
the halls of this hospital

04:11.313 --> 04:13.252
Without the possibility
of running

04:13.287 --> 04:16.934
Into that bearded hug monster
you call a best friend.

04:23.059 --> 04:26.103
<i>Sorry I took so long, honey.
The line was long.</i>

04:26.138 --> 04:28.914
Uh-huh.
How'd j.D. Take the news?

04:28.948 --> 04:30.721
He's not here today.

04:30.755 --> 04:32.294
(groans) I can't believe you.

04:32.328 --> 04:34.570
Yeah, right, like you weren't
just telling elliott.

04:34.604 --> 04:36.510
Well, I wasn't,
because when I say something

04:36.545 --> 04:38.920
Is between us as a couple,
it stays between us.

04:38.954 --> 04:40.660
I'm sorry.

04:40.695 --> 04:42.802
(pager beeps)

04:42.837 --> 04:44.542
I gotta go.
Congratulations.

04:44.577 --> 04:47.018
Mwah! All right?

04:48.492 --> 04:50.599
(both squealing)

04:52.474 --> 04:54.313
(squealing stops)

04:54.348 --> 04:55.920
Had the--
the test result--
intern. Yeah.

04:55.954 --> 04:57.961
Uh, the bleeding
and the, um, you know--
I know, I know, yeah.

04:57.996 --> 05:00.705
(both cheering and laughing)

05:00.740 --> 05:03.952
(lazlo bane) ¶ I can't do this
all on my own ¶

05:03.986 --> 05:05.491
¶ no, I know ¶

05:05.525 --> 05:07.198
¶ I'm no superman ¶

05:07.232 --> 05:11.682
¶

05:14.896 --> 05:17.538
You told elliott and got
that huge, excited reaction.

05:17.572 --> 05:20.249
I deserve to get that
from someone, too.
One person.

05:20.283 --> 05:22.323
One person, thank you.
(laughs)

05:22.358 --> 05:25.001
Hey, elliot, let me tell j.D.
About the baby.
Already did it.

05:25.035 --> 05:28.013
(cell phone beeps)
(j.D.) so, anyway, tell turk
that's great news

05:28.047 --> 05:29.987
About his baby.
That's it?

05:30.022 --> 05:32.998
Elliot, why would you put me
on speaker without telling me?

05:33.034 --> 05:35.409
Turk, I'm so excited for you!
Too little, too late,
buddy!

05:35.443 --> 05:38.018
Turk!
I don't wanna talk
to you, j.D.!

05:38.053 --> 05:39.156
Turk!
No.

05:39.191 --> 05:40.595
Turk!
Not here.

05:40.630 --> 05:42.770
Elliot,
is turk still there?

05:45.415 --> 05:47.689
Everybody's having babies.

05:47.725 --> 05:50.032
It's getting a little boring.
Dude!

05:50.066 --> 05:51.940
Elliot, take me off speaker!

05:51.974 --> 05:54.884
(beeping)
I'm trying!
Stupid technology!

05:54.919 --> 05:57.428
See you soon.
Dr. Cox, two quick things.

05:57.462 --> 05:59.335
First off, I looked up
a picture of sonny bono,

05:59.370 --> 06:01.945
And my feelings
are very, very hurt.
Noted.

06:01.980 --> 06:04.924
Apology accepted. Second, I know
we're aren't supposed to ask you

06:04.958 --> 06:06.396
About mr. Francone--
huh?

06:06.431 --> 06:07.903
The potato.
Right.

06:07.937 --> 06:10.412
See, the thing is, his sister
just called from london,

06:10.447 --> 06:13.726
And she was hoping we could keep
mr. Francone--the potato--
oh.

06:13.760 --> 06:16.000
Alive until she got here.
Can you please help?

06:16.035 --> 06:18.946
Let me see his chart.
I'll tell you what to do first.

06:18.980 --> 06:21.121
Go ahead
and write this down.
Okay.

06:21.155 --> 06:24.099
Wrap him in foil and poke holes
in him with a fork

06:24.134 --> 06:26.609
So he cooks
all the way through.
Come on.

06:26.643 --> 06:29.153
Sunshine, I have neither
the inclination or the time

06:29.187 --> 06:31.126
To care about people
who I cannot help.

06:31.162 --> 06:34.205
If you're looking for someone
whose heartstrings you can tug,

06:34.240 --> 06:35.979
Well... There's your gal.

06:36.014 --> 06:38.857
She cares. In fact,
it's her only real fault.

06:38.891 --> 06:41.902
Look at her over there.
She's caring right now.

06:41.937 --> 06:44.580
Go! Go, go, go, go.

06:44.614 --> 06:46.889
Actually, yeah,
dr. Cox is here.

06:46.923 --> 06:49.398
(j.D.) god help me.
I could sense it.

06:49.433 --> 06:51.908
Put me in his pocket.
J.D., I'm--

06:51.942 --> 06:55.388
Elliot, please. I want this.
(sighs)

06:59.941 --> 07:01.948
(groans) I miss my boyfriend
much.

07:01.982 --> 07:04.926
If he were here, I might
actually lick his face.

07:04.960 --> 07:06.399
Thank you, dr. Appropriate.

07:06.433 --> 07:09.176
Peggy, I'm gonna have
a quick chat with these two,

07:09.210 --> 07:10.247
Okay, sweetie?

07:10.281 --> 07:11.552
Thanks, bob.

07:11.587 --> 07:14.363
Send peggy for an a.B.G.
And a chest c.T.,

07:14.397 --> 07:17.241
And when you're done,
send her sputum for atypicals.

07:17.275 --> 07:20.119
Dr. Kelso, you do realize that
you don't work here anymore.

07:20.153 --> 07:22.194
Look, her husband
was an old friend.

07:22.228 --> 07:24.737
Plus, I have forgotten more
about medicine

07:24.771 --> 07:27.013
Than you t will ever know.

07:27.047 --> 07:28.285
I don't know you,

07:28.319 --> 07:31.195
But I assume I have you beat
because you're blonde

07:31.230 --> 07:33.672
And you're rolling
with dr. Reeks-of-beer.

07:33.706 --> 07:36.617
It's my hair, okay?
Yeah, and watch the lip,
grandpa,

07:36.651 --> 07:38.926
Because you wouldn't be
the first old man

07:38.960 --> 07:40.934
I ever beat up.
Ha!

07:40.968 --> 07:43.377
I like her.
She's got girl balls.

07:43.411 --> 07:47.894
(j.D.) ahh, I love listening
to you work.

07:47.929 --> 07:49.701
Come on. Admit it.

07:49.736 --> 07:53.684
You miss me
as much as I miss you.

07:53.718 --> 07:55.123
There you go, dorian.

07:55.157 --> 07:57.331
That's what I think of you
as a person.

07:57.366 --> 08:00.979
I hope you enjoyed it.
Here, you.
I didn't hear it all,
but that sounded harsh.

08:01.013 --> 08:02.652
Are you okay?
(high-pitched voice) no!

08:02.686 --> 08:05.095
Hey, teddy, carla said
I could tell something

08:05.129 --> 08:08.341
To just one person,
so here goes!

08:08.376 --> 08:11.487
Carla and I are having a baby!
Oh, great.

08:11.521 --> 08:13.930
(ted and bob murmuring)
what the hell is the matter
with you people?

08:13.964 --> 08:17.276
<i>Carla and I are having a baby!
No, you're having
a second baby.</i>

08:17.311 --> 08:19.183
It's not that big a deal.

08:19.218 --> 08:21.627
When we had ours,
we barely told anybody.

08:21.661 --> 08:25.307
You had a second kid?
A little girl.
You held her in your arms.

08:25.342 --> 08:29.157
Mazel tov to you both.
Can't a brother get
at least a mazel tov?

08:29.191 --> 08:31.331
Gooch and I are gonna hold off
on the babies.

08:31.366 --> 08:33.339
We've only known each other
a week.

08:33.374 --> 08:37.522
Plus, with all the cycling,

08:37.557 --> 08:39.429
Apparently I've do
and mine don't have any tails.

08:39.464 --> 08:43.077
They're just kinda blobs
that roll from place to place.

08:43.111 --> 08:45.018
Oh, hey, everybody,
I'll tell you someone

08:45.053 --> 08:47.528
<i>Who just did have
their first baby.</i>

08:47.562 --> 08:49.369
Witman up in radiology!

08:49.403 --> 08:51.477
Come on! Witman!

08:51.512 --> 08:53.652
No! Witman's not even here!

08:53.686 --> 08:55.057
Hey, nurse espinosa. Carla.

08:55.092 --> 08:56.999
Look, I know
you're not working tonight,

08:57.033 --> 08:59.341
But I was hoping
you could stay and help me

08:59.376 --> 09:02.152
Keep my coma patient alive
until his sister gets here.

09:02.186 --> 09:05.197
What do you say? A little coffee
and girl talk? It might be fun.
Mm.

09:05.232 --> 09:08.176
Anay, dr. Cox said that
you were the one I should ask.

09:08.210 --> 09:09.950
He did, did he?

09:09.984 --> 09:11.823
Hi!
(laughs)

09:11.857 --> 09:12.928
(groans)

09:12.963 --> 09:15.772
So can you stay
and help me out tonight?

09:15.807 --> 09:18.784
I'll see what I can do.
Yay!

09:18.819 --> 09:21.762
Dial it down.
(quietly) yay.

09:23.905 --> 09:26.381
(sighs)

09:26.415 --> 09:27.919
You eatin' lunch?

09:27.954 --> 09:29.359
What gave it away?

09:29.394 --> 09:31.534
J.D. And I
usually eat lunch together.

09:31.568 --> 09:33.575
Oh, god, here it comes.

09:33.610 --> 09:35.583
J.D. Was sitting
in that exact chair

09:35.618 --> 09:38.093
When we had
our third kiss.
Oh, that's very romantic.

09:38.127 --> 09:40.737
I will try not to drillany more.

09:40.771 --> 09:43.849
I just feel like something's
been weighing me down all day.

09:43.883 --> 09:46.359
I mean, sure,
I was in the x-ray room

09:46.393 --> 09:48.467
A couple of hours ago,
and when I left,

09:48.502 --> 09:51.512
I totally forgot
to take off the lead vest,

09:51.546 --> 09:54.256
But it's off now,
and the weight's still there.

09:54.290 --> 09:56.665
I mean, it's not as bad,
but it's pretty bad.

09:56.701 --> 10:00.414
(sighs) it just sucks,
you know?
I don't see how
it could get any worse.

10:00.448 --> 10:02.188
(pager beeps)

10:02.222 --> 10:04.999
I don't understand
how this happened.

10:05.033 --> 10:06.939
She just went like that.

10:06.974 --> 10:10.086
Hey, dr. Turk,
what are you working on?

10:10.120 --> 10:12.260
Signing a death certificate
for a kid who pass--

10:12.295 --> 10:13.699
Oh, good for you!

10:13.733 --> 10:15.740
Hey, listen, were you
one of the people

10:15.775 --> 10:18.016
Who didn't believe
I had a girlfriend?

10:18.051 --> 10:20.292
Because... Bam!
There she is!

10:20.327 --> 10:22.735
Wow. She's...
Too cute for you, ted.

10:22.769 --> 10:24.475
Right. Spread the word.

10:24.510 --> 10:26.483
Stephanie,
this is dr. Turk.

10:26.518 --> 10:27.955
Hey.
How's it goin'?

10:27.990 --> 10:30.699
It's pretty good.
I'm having a baby, you know.

10:30.734 --> 10:33.410
Is this your first?

10:33.444 --> 10:35.385
Why, yes, it is.

10:35.419 --> 10:37.861
That is so awesome!
Congratulations!

10:37.895 --> 10:40.705
That's what
I was looking for! Wow!
I wanna know everything.

10:40.739 --> 10:42.780
Do you wanna talk
about it?

10:42.814 --> 10:45.524
Gooch, let's go talk about it.
See, now what happened was...

10:47.499 --> 10:49.239
Good night, dr. Cox.

10:49.273 --> 10:52.150
Isn't carla staying
to help you out?
She id
she had things to do.

10:52.185 --> 10:54.961
But that's okay. I know
I haven't been a doctor long,

10:54.996 --> 10:56.969
But I'm great
at placing I.V.S,

10:57.004 --> 10:58.944
And you know,
giving pills to people,

10:58.978 --> 11:01.587
So I should be fine.
Huh.

11:01.621 --> 11:04.833
(nervously) oh, good.
You're gone, too.

11:04.868 --> 11:08.247
Peggy was a sweet old bird.

11:08.281 --> 11:11.292
She only had pneumonia.

11:11.327 --> 11:14.270
She and her husband
were together for 50 years.

11:14.304 --> 11:15.710
Sometimes in those cases,

11:15.744 --> 11:18.152
It's not the illness
that gets you.

11:18.187 --> 11:20.997
I mean,
your soul mate's gone,

11:21.031 --> 11:23.038
And your body just gives up.

11:23.072 --> 11:26.551
I actually think
it'sind of sweet.

11:26.586 --> 11:29.630
I don't know.
If I ever get married...

11:29.665 --> 11:33.010
And my husband dies
before me...

11:33.045 --> 11:35.955
I'm sure that I'll have enough
going on in my own life

11:35.990 --> 11:38.498
That I'll want
to keep on living, you know?

11:38.533 --> 11:41.477
Well, that's just some quality
crap you're spewing there.

11:41.511 --> 11:43.618
You've been moping around here
all day

11:43.653 --> 11:46.797
Just because dorian's
been gone, what, 12 hours?

11:46.833 --> 11:49.776
And I'm guessing you didn't
hear a word I just said

11:49.810 --> 11:51.817
Because you're looking
at your telephone

11:51.852 --> 11:54.863
To see if he has texted you
in the last five minutes.

11:54.897 --> 11:56.068
Did he?

11:56.102 --> 11:57.172
Yes.

11:57.206 --> 11:58.711
(beep)
"thinking of you."

11:58.745 --> 11:59.849
See?

11:59.884 --> 12:01.321
And there's the smile.

12:01.356 --> 12:04.333
You see, you're no different
from peggy.

12:04.368 --> 12:06.274
What are you saying,
that if j.D. Died,

12:06.309 --> 12:09.352
I would just die
right afterwards?
Well, I could only hope.

12:09.388 --> 12:10.926
But my point is,

12:10.960 --> 12:13.971
Don't stand there
being judgmental about her

12:14.005 --> 12:16.481
When you're no different.

12:18.188 --> 12:20.262
(knock on door)

12:22.204 --> 12:24.613
(mouth full)
what are you doing here?

12:24.647 --> 12:27.223
Well, I think
the better question is,

12:27.258 --> 12:29.532
What are you doing here?
I live here.

12:29.567 --> 12:32.510
That's not the better question.
It's the worst question.

12:32.545 --> 12:35.924
Why aren't you at the hospital
helping cheery, annoying intern?
I had stuff to do.

12:35.958 --> 12:38.300
What gives you the right
to give me a hard time?

12:38.334 --> 12:41.680
<i>Why aren't you at the hospital
helping sunny?
Because I don't give a damn</i>

12:41.714 --> 12:44.056
About terminal coma patients
or interns.

12:44.090 --> 12:47.669
I get to not give a damn because
I know that you always will.

12:47.705 --> 12:50.849
I mean, give me a break, carla.
Tell me the last time

12:50.884 --> 12:54.028
<i>That you ever walked off
on a patient.
The guy's been in a coma
for a year, okay?</i>

12:54.062 --> 12:57.107
He's an eggplant.
Okay, first of all,
he's not an eggplant.

12:57.141 --> 12:58.545
He's a potato.

12:58.580 --> 13:00.855
And secondly, that's something
I would say, not you.

13:00.889 --> 13:04.469
You used to care so much
about this stuff, remember?

13:04.504 --> 13:06.845
What happened to you?

13:08.687 --> 13:10.224
Oh.

13:10.260 --> 13:13.438
It's always good to slam a door
right about now.

13:19.897 --> 13:23.310
Hey, sunny,
how'd it go last night?

13:23.344 --> 13:25.518
Great.
Thank god.

13:25.552 --> 13:27.961
I mean, he crashed a few times,
but I brought him back.

13:27.995 --> 13:29.969
I mean, really,
the only scary moment

13:30.003 --> 13:32.478
Was when he seized while I was
injecting him with dopamine.

13:32.514 --> 13:34.052
The needle slipped,

13:34.086 --> 13:36.026
And I accidentally
stabbed myself with it,

13:36.061 --> 13:38.001
But I only freaked out
for a second

13:38.035 --> 13:39.974
Until I remembered
that comas aren't contagious.

13:40.009 --> 13:41.916
And then
the dopamine kicked in,

13:41.950 --> 13:43.857
Which actually made
the whole night more enjoyable,

13:43.891 --> 13:46.568
But now I'm sort of jonesing
for another hit. Is that bad?

13:46.602 --> 13:48.576
Let's go downstairs
and get you some juice.

13:48.610 --> 13:51.052
Kelso's right. J.D.'s gone,
and I'm miserable.

13:51.086 --> 13:53.361
I used to be such a strong,
independent woman,

13:53.396 --> 13:56.105
Did you know, once, I actually
changed the oil in my car

13:56.140 --> 13:57.511
All by myself?

13:57.545 --> 13:59.049
Saved 30 bucks.
Cool.

13:59.084 --> 14:01.124
Yeah, unfortunately,
I dumped the dirty, old oil

14:01.159 --> 14:02.530
Into a storm drain.

14:02.564 --> 14:04.571
The department of fish
and wildlife

14:04.605 --> 14:06.044
Fined me 1,400 bucks

14:06.078 --> 14:07.984
And declared me
an "enemy of the ocean,"

14:08.019 --> 14:10.026
Whatever the hell
that means.

14:10.060 --> 14:12.402
Hey! I know I usually
write songs for kids,

14:12.436 --> 14:15.815
But I wrote a song for you.
Do you want to hear it?
Yeah.

14:15.850 --> 14:17.756
¶ you knocked up
your lady ¶

14:17.791 --> 14:19.731
¶ now you're havin'
a baby ¶

14:19.765 --> 14:22.374
¶ 'cause you're gonna be
a first-time dad ¶

14:22.408 --> 14:25.386
¶ people used to tell you
that your life was meant to ¶

14:25.420 --> 14:27.795
¶ procreate a family
of your own ¶

14:27.830 --> 14:31.510
¶ then you went and did it,
'cause you finally did it ¶

14:31.545 --> 14:34.188
¶ now you're gonna have
your own turk clone ¶

14:34.222 --> 14:37.433
¶ there's a little baby
in your lady's soft womb ¶
uh-huh.

14:37.468 --> 14:40.110
¶ so just sit tight  an¶

14:40.145 --> 14:43.357
¶ it's time to realize that
your life is gonna change soon ¶

14:43.391 --> 14:45.231
¶ you'll be a dad,
first-time, first-time ¶

14:45.265 --> 14:48.109
¶ you're a dad,
first-time, first-time ¶
ha! Whoo!

14:48.143 --> 14:49.380
¶ and remember ¶

14:49.414 --> 14:50.785
Whoo!

14:50.821 --> 14:52.225
Whoo...

14:52.260 --> 14:55.471
Did you tell her
it was our first baby?
It's not your first?

14:55.505 --> 14:58.048
Um... It's our first
since our first.

14:58.082 --> 14:59.988
Hey, carla,
were you one of those people

15:00.023 --> 15:02.900
Who didn't believe
I haa girlfriend?
Not now, ted.

15:02.935 --> 15:05.410
When izzy's 15
and she's trying to decide

15:05.444 --> 15:07.318
Which one of us
she likes better,

15:07.352 --> 15:10.363
<i>I'm so gonna use this.</i>

15:14.212 --> 15:15.683
(slams clipboard)

15:15.718 --> 15:18.327
What is your problem?
My husband's telling everybody

15:18.362 --> 15:21.406
That I'm pregnant
with our first child.
Carla, if you're gonna
get upset

15:21.440 --> 15:23.381
Every time your husband
does something stupid,

15:23.415 --> 15:26.358
Then you're going to be upset
every second of every minute,

15:26.394 --> 15:28.534
Every minute of every hour,
every hour of every day,

15:28.568 --> 15:30.877
Every day--
stop.

15:30.911 --> 15:35.260
I was prepared to go to century,
but that's not why I'm here.
I know. I left the poor intern
alone last night.

15:35.295 --> 15:37.201
I can't believe I did that.

15:37.235 --> 15:39.142
I mean, don't get me wrong.
She did a great job.

15:39.177 --> 15:41.150
Although, once she had
a nightmare

15:41.185 --> 15:43.091
That the coma patient
woke up and stabbed her,

15:43.125 --> 15:45.032
She actually tied the patient
to the bed,

15:45.066 --> 15:47.576
Which she probably shouldn't
have done, but that's on me.

15:47.610 --> 15:50.587
So go ahead,
rub it in my face.
As much as I'm a huge fan

15:50.621 --> 15:52.628
Of a good, old-fashioned
face rubbing,

15:52.662 --> 15:54.536
I'm here to apologize.

15:54.570 --> 15:57.012
(j.D.) apologize for what?
Elliot, slow down!

15:57.046 --> 15:59.053
No. J.D., you're talking
to me.

15:59.088 --> 16:01.296
Fine. You sound upset.
What's wrong?

16:01.330 --> 16:03.404
(sighs) I don't wanna
get into it.

16:03.438 --> 16:06.382
You know what I do
when I need to clear my head?

16:06.417 --> 16:09.461
I just let my mind drift
and fantasize about stuff.

16:09.496 --> 16:10.867
Yeah, I've noticed.

16:10.901 --> 16:14.380
J.D.? J.D., you're fantasizing
right now, aren't you?

16:14.415 --> 16:16.923
That's why you should
never trust a camel.

16:16.958 --> 16:18.329
(laughs)

16:18.364 --> 16:20.538
Hey, man, I wanted
to warn you.

16:20.572 --> 16:22.445
Stay clear
of my girlfriend.

16:22.480 --> 16:26.762
The gooch does not like
being lied to.
I'm pretty sure
I can handle it, ted.

16:26.796 --> 16:29.573
Why did you lie about that
being your first kid, anyway?

16:29.607 --> 16:31.849
'cause when carla told me
about the new baby,

16:31.883 --> 16:34.292
I didn't get that crazy,
excited feeling I got

16:34.326 --> 16:36.199
When I heard about izzy.

16:36.234 --> 16:39.010
I'm an idiot.
Nah, it's just
your second kid.

16:39.045 --> 16:41.252
Look, I don't know
if you noticed,

16:41.287 --> 16:43.193
But I've been kinda,
like, jazzed

16:43.228 --> 16:45.201
Cionado
about this being
my first girlfriend.

16:45.236 --> 16:47.243
You know,
it's new and exciting.

16:47.277 --> 16:48.715
But when she dumps me--

16:48.749 --> 16:50.756
And believe me, it'soming
like a freight train--

16:50.790 --> 16:52.932
I'll try to find a new gal,

16:52.966 --> 16:56.077
And if I do, it probably won't
have that initial excitement

16:56.112 --> 16:58.018
That the first one did.

16:58.053 --> 17:00.963
(laughs) but that doesn't mean
it wouldn't be great,

17:00.997 --> 17:03.908
'cause, I mean, I'd be having
a second girlfriend.

17:03.942 --> 17:05.915
Yeah.

17:05.950 --> 17:08.859
Does this have anything to do
with your situation?

17:08.895 --> 17:10.266
Kinda.

17:10.300 --> 17:13.243
Hey!
I know, we had a great ride.
Still friends?

17:13.279 --> 17:15.654
Not you, ted!
Ooh, still alive!

17:15.688 --> 17:18.699
So help me, if you ever make me
look like a fool again,

17:18.733 --> 17:20.773
I'll bash your face in
with this thing

17:20.808 --> 17:23.617
Until it is a million pieces.
Are we clear?
Crystal.

17:23.652 --> 17:25.559
Good.

17:25.594 --> 17:27.366
(bang)

17:27.401 --> 17:28.772
Nope.

17:28.807 --> 17:32.152
The gooch does not like
being lied to.

17:34.061 --> 17:35.766
Whose room is this?

17:35.801 --> 17:37.272
Kelso's dead friend.

17:37.306 --> 17:39.849
Oh, yeah,
that old biddy.

17:39.883 --> 17:41.288
You see?

17:41.322 --> 17:44.701
I never used to say stuff
like that.

17:44.735 --> 17:46.676
Unless it's someone I know,
and even then,

17:46.710 --> 17:51.394
If it happens in a funny way,
like my cousin

17:51.429 --> 17:53.401
Who, honest to god,
wafli still actually enjoy it.

17:53.437 --> 17:54.841
I abandoned an intern

17:54.876 --> 17:57.049
Who was just trying
to keep her patient alive

17:57.084 --> 17:59.057
So his sister
could say good-bye.

17:59.092 --> 18:02.170
Look, sooner or later, everybody
in this place stops caring

18:02.204 --> 18:05.148
About hopeless, terminally ill,
brain-dead coma patients

18:05.183 --> 18:07.658
And interns who want
to save the world.

18:07.692 --> 18:10.803
You somehow managed
to hang on

18:10.838 --> 18:13.950
Quite a bit longer
than the rest of us.

18:13.984 --> 18:16.827
Carla, you are
a wonderful nurse.

18:16.862 --> 18:19.337
You got a husband,
plus you got a kid,

18:19.371 --> 18:21.345
Plus you got another kid
coming.

18:21.379 --> 18:24.490
It was completely unfair of me
to expect more of you

18:24.525 --> 18:26.699
Than anyone else
in this dump.

18:26.734 --> 18:29.309
And brace yourself,
'cause here it comes--

18:29.344 --> 18:33.693
I, percival ulysses cox...

18:33.727 --> 18:36.304
Am sorry.

18:36.338 --> 18:39.717
"ulysses"?
Shh, shh, shh.

18:39.751 --> 18:42.494
(beeping)
(randy coleman) ¶ write your
name and put it on my cast ¶

18:42.529 --> 18:45.808
So just call him already.
You know you want to.

18:45.842 --> 18:48.752
No. I don't want to end up
being an old lady

18:48.786 --> 18:50.627
Who's so dependent
on her partner

18:50.661 --> 18:53.839
That she just croaks
right after he does.
I wish I was
emotionally healthy enough

18:53.873 --> 18:56.583
To love someone so much
that I died after they did.

18:56.617 --> 18:58.859
<i>I was with that dude
last night.</i>

18:58.893 --> 19:00.799
The only way
I'm going to die after him

19:00.834 --> 19:03.778
Is if he had a heart attack
while he was on top of me.

19:03.812 --> 19:06.154
Crap, I just turned myself on.
Rudy!

19:06.188 --> 19:07.894
Upstairs.

19:07.928 --> 19:10.438
God help me,
I like that crazy bitch.

19:10.472 --> 19:13.449
I thought it would be different
this time with j.D.

19:13.484 --> 19:16.427
I didn't think I'd let myself
get so vulnerable.

19:16.462 --> 19:18.000
Well, that's dumb.

19:18.035 --> 19:20.979
Relationships are
about taking a leap of faith.

19:21.013 --> 19:23.455
That's why
it's called "jumping in."

19:23.490 --> 19:25.798
Now dorian seems
to make you happy.

19:25.832 --> 19:28.207
God knows why.
Isn't that enough?

19:28.242 --> 19:31.118
¶ you found another way
to get it back instead ¶
(beeps)

19:31.153 --> 19:32.590
(j.D.) hello?

19:32.626 --> 19:35.970
Hey, I miss you.

19:36.005 --> 19:38.280
¶

19:38.314 --> 19:40.188
I get why it wigged you out.

19:40.222 --> 19:43.233
At the end of the day,
relationships are tricky.

19:43.267 --> 19:44.672
(groans) please don't do

19:44.706 --> 19:46.813
That whole philosophical,
pontificating thing.

19:46.848 --> 19:48.152
Okay.

19:48.186 --> 19:49.725
Fine. Go ahead.

19:49.759 --> 19:50.929
Thanks.

19:50.964 --> 19:53.707
Things are always different
the second time around.

19:53.741 --> 19:56.217
You are about to be
a big sister, izzy.

19:56.252 --> 19:58.492
Yes, you are. Huh?

19:58.527 --> 20:00.433
You just have to remember

20:00.468 --> 20:03.311
That even if things are changing
all around you,

20:03.345 --> 20:06.390
Deep down
you're still the same person.
(scoffs) I guess.

20:06.424 --> 20:09.938
Hey, carla, can I talk to you
for a second?

20:09.972 --> 20:12.179
You know you're not supposed
to be working tonight, right?

20:12.214 --> 20:15.191
Yeah, I know, but sunny said
the sister would be here

20:15.226 --> 20:17.768
In about six hours, and...

20:17.803 --> 20:21.349
I'm not ready to let g
of that part of myself yet.

20:21.383 --> 20:22.687
You know?

20:22.722 --> 20:24.527
Yes.

20:24.562 --> 20:26.770
Do you want to stay
and help?

20:26.804 --> 20:27.510
No, I do not.

20:27.544 --> 20:30.150
Good night, ulysses.

20:32.000 --> 20:38.074

Hi Perry!

20:43.867 --> 20:45.841
Probably checking your pockets right now,

20:45.875 --> 20:46.815
But I'm not there.

20:46.883 --> 20:49.893
See, I had elliot hide me
somewhere in your office.

20:49.962 --> 20:51.901
Now while I've got you,

20:51.970 --> 20:54.412
I-I thought we could discuss
our relationship.

20:54.480 --> 20:57.256
It's had some ups,
and it's had some downs.

20:57.324 --> 20:59.933
I'm gonna start
by passing out some gold stars.

21:00.001 --> 21:02.945
The first one goes to you
for your passion.

21:03.013 --> 21:06.459
<i>The next one goes to me
for my compassion.</i>

21:06.527 --> 21:08.467
What I think we should do

21:08.535 --> 21:10.642
<i>Is take passion
and compassion...</i>
