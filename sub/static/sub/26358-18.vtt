WEBVTT

00:04.874 --> 00:06.180
Careful.

00:06.223 --> 00:08.356
Very careful.

00:08.399 --> 00:10.488
Watch the hydrangeas.

00:10.532 --> 00:13.100
I said careful. Holy mackerel.

00:13.143 --> 00:14.797
Gentlemen, please.

00:14.840 --> 00:16.103
This is a brand-new car.

00:16.146 --> 00:18.322
We know, Mrs. Bunny.
Uh, we know.

00:26.200 --> 00:27.636
No. SÃ­.

00:27.679 --> 00:29.029
Muffy?

00:36.862 --> 00:39.387
It's broken, actually.

00:39.430 --> 00:41.824
And it would cost more
to repair it than replace it,

00:41.867 --> 00:43.869
which is why
I am throwing it out.

00:43.913 --> 00:46.220
And as for my name,

00:46.263 --> 00:48.526
"Bunny" beats the pants off
of "Babs"

00:48.570 --> 00:50.528
or "Barbie,"
the only other two choices

00:50.572 --> 00:53.053
my teacher gave all the Barbaras
in my class.

00:53.096 --> 00:55.011
And yes, you're right.

00:55.055 --> 00:57.361
Muffy is a ridiculous name
for a grown woman.

00:57.405 --> 00:59.102
She's also the person

00:59.146 --> 01:02.627
who sang your praises
and the reason I hired you.

01:02.671 --> 01:04.064
Uh, w-we're really
sorry, ma'am.

01:04.107 --> 01:05.108
We didn't know
you spoke Spanish,

01:05.152 --> 01:08.111
Mrs... Bunny.

01:08.155 --> 01:09.852
It's fine.

01:09.895 --> 01:11.332
I've moved on.

01:12.550 --> 01:13.812
Just get that thing
out of my sight

01:13.856 --> 01:15.597
without damaging my car
or my driveway.

01:15.640 --> 01:16.946
Okay.

01:23.257 --> 01:24.693
Uno, dos, tres.Uno, dos, tres.

01:29.306 --> 01:31.613
BUNNY:
What is it? Is it paint?

01:32.788 --> 01:34.920
What's that smell?

01:34.964 --> 01:36.139
Is it a squirrel?

01:36.183 --> 01:38.228
Is that a dead squirrel?

01:38.272 --> 01:41.101
Is that a family
of dead squirrels?!

01:41.144 --> 01:43.146
No, Mrs. Bunny.

01:43.190 --> 01:45.105
It's not a squirrel.

02:19.487 --> 02:20.836
Hi.

02:20.879 --> 02:22.707
Huh.What are you doing here?

02:22.751 --> 02:25.580
Oh, well,
good morning to you, too.Seriously,

02:25.623 --> 02:26.972
how do you even you know
where Eric and I live?

02:27.016 --> 02:28.626
Your housewarming party.

02:28.670 --> 02:30.367
You were a no-show.

02:30.411 --> 02:32.674
Your address was on the invite.

02:32.717 --> 02:34.806
Okay, let's try this again.

02:34.850 --> 02:36.417
Uh, hi.

02:36.460 --> 02:37.592
What are you doing here?

02:37.635 --> 02:39.507
I thought
we could get breakfast.

02:39.550 --> 02:40.943
Coffee?

02:40.986 --> 02:43.163
Good coffee? I know
you can't say no to good coffee.

02:43.206 --> 02:46.427
Sydney, what are you doing here?

02:46.470 --> 02:48.080
Let's start over.

02:49.343 --> 02:51.258
I am just a girl

02:51.301 --> 02:53.521
standing in front of a Nell...

02:53.564 --> 02:54.913
No. Do not do that.

02:54.957 --> 02:56.001
Do not manipulate me

02:56.045 --> 02:57.655
by way of Notting Hill.

02:57.699 --> 03:00.180
So unfair.
Do you want good coffee or not?

03:00.223 --> 03:01.485
Come on,
don't overthink it.

03:01.529 --> 03:03.792
I mean... fine.

03:03.835 --> 03:05.141
But you're buying.Okay. Great.

03:05.185 --> 03:06.229
'Cause you are driving.Mm.

03:06.273 --> 03:07.317
Mm-hmm.

03:08.318 --> 03:10.320
CALLEN:
26.

03:10.364 --> 03:13.280
27.

03:13.323 --> 03:16.587
28. 29.

03:16.631 --> 03:18.502
Doesn't count if
you're only counting.

03:18.546 --> 03:20.243
I'm sorry. I'm just amazed.

03:20.287 --> 03:22.245
Why? My form?
No.

03:22.289 --> 03:24.421
That I continue to learn things
about you after all these years.

03:24.465 --> 03:26.641
How you're so good
at defusing bombs

03:26.684 --> 03:28.512
and diving for cover,

03:28.556 --> 03:30.514
things that require real skill
and coordination,

03:30.558 --> 03:33.517
and yet...
you're such a horrible dancer.

03:33.561 --> 03:37.434
Youthink I'm bad
on the dance floor? You?

03:37.478 --> 03:40.394
You dance like a spunky kid
mainlining Smarties.

03:40.437 --> 03:41.656
I got moves.

03:41.699 --> 03:42.874
Well, yeah, technically
your body was moving.

03:42.918 --> 03:44.093
I'll give you that.

03:44.136 --> 03:45.225
It was Kensi and Deeks' wedding.

03:45.268 --> 03:47.096
I was having a good time.

03:47.139 --> 03:49.403
So good that the videographer
is gonna have to cut around you.

03:49.446 --> 03:51.274
You don't know what
you're talking about.

03:51.318 --> 03:53.929
Michelle loved
the way I danced.
Really?

03:53.972 --> 03:55.365
Trust me.
Uh-huh.

03:55.409 --> 03:58.194
Or did she just love you?

03:58.238 --> 04:00.109
Am I, uh,
interrupting something?

04:00.152 --> 04:02.372
No, no, no, no. Callen
was just giving me

04:02.416 --> 04:05.506
his unsolicited opinion. Again.

04:05.549 --> 04:07.072
Oh, wow. I didn't realize

04:07.116 --> 04:09.074
how sensitive Sam was
about his dance moves.

04:10.075 --> 04:11.773
You were criticizing Sam's...

04:11.816 --> 04:13.209
Wow.

04:13.253 --> 04:14.732
You are a brave, brave
man, Grisha Callen.

04:14.776 --> 04:17.648
Hmm. What did you think
of me out there?Mm-hmm. Yeah.

04:17.692 --> 04:19.041
I'm sorry, what-what did...

04:19.084 --> 04:22.436
what did I... think? Um...

04:22.479 --> 04:24.438
If I'm being
totally honest, I think

04:24.481 --> 04:26.918
we have a case that needs
our immediate attention.

04:26.962 --> 04:28.659
Shall we? Let's go.

04:28.703 --> 04:30.792
Good deflection.

04:30.835 --> 04:32.750
Cuts like a knife, baby.

04:32.794 --> 04:34.361
You know I can see you, Beale.

04:34.404 --> 04:36.058
Yeah. Copy that.

04:36.101 --> 04:38.103
Don't talk about brave.

04:40.410 --> 04:42.847
Nice and easy. We just
stick with the plan.

04:42.891 --> 04:44.153
You know, I was thinking,

04:44.196 --> 04:46.286
I really don't think
that we need a plan.

04:46.329 --> 04:48.723
Yeah, we do, because
when the time comes,

04:48.766 --> 04:50.725
this is gonna be the hardest
thing you've ever had to do.

04:50.768 --> 04:52.204
Yeah, I disagree.

04:52.248 --> 04:53.945
Well, listen, don't worry.
You're not alone in this.

04:53.989 --> 04:55.295
It's gonna test
both of our wills.

04:55.338 --> 04:56.861
Yeah, I'm pretty sure I'm good.

04:56.905 --> 04:58.646
I know that you're strong and
you think you can do this,

04:58.689 --> 05:01.344
but when the time comes...Uh-huh.

05:01.388 --> 05:03.564
...you're not gonna be able
to keep your hands off me.

05:03.607 --> 05:05.827
I'm pretty sure I will.Listen,

05:05.870 --> 05:07.655
I'm adorable. You're gonna
want to jump my bones.

05:07.698 --> 05:10.266
Mm, not if you keep this up.But this is a place of work.

05:10.310 --> 05:12.268
It is a place of work.
That's what I'm trying to say.It's not appropriate.

05:12.312 --> 05:13.791
We got to keep the
love on lockdown.I really need to...

05:13.835 --> 05:15.315
Got to lock it down.
Listen, look at me.Mm-hmm.

05:15.358 --> 05:16.968
Look at me. Look at me.

05:17.012 --> 05:18.666
We just spent the whole
weekend in Malibu, right?Right.

05:18.709 --> 05:19.884
As husband and wife.Mm-hmm.

05:19.928 --> 05:22.060
Naked in the sun.Beautiful.

05:22.104 --> 05:24.062
Everything has changed.

05:25.107 --> 05:26.848
Has it, though?

05:26.891 --> 05:28.284
Yes.
No.

05:29.329 --> 05:31.156
No.
Yes.

05:31.200 --> 05:33.028
Wait, don't speak.

05:34.072 --> 05:35.160
No.
Yes.

05:36.205 --> 05:38.338
No.
Yes.

05:38.381 --> 05:40.688
No. No.Uh-huh.

05:40.731 --> 05:44.082
Kens, Deeks. How was the 'Bu?

05:44.126 --> 05:45.475
I would say it was
life-changing.

05:45.519 --> 05:47.259
And I would say
it was as beautiful as always.

05:47.303 --> 05:48.391
Oh, yeah. They're married.

05:48.435 --> 05:51.002
Mm-hmm. Where's Nell?

05:51.046 --> 05:53.222
Hmm? Oh, she had an appointment.

05:54.484 --> 05:56.486
Wait. Was that last week
that she had that appointment?

05:56.530 --> 05:58.009
Oh, that's right.

05:58.053 --> 05:59.924
Yeah, no, she does not
have an appointment.

05:59.968 --> 06:02.492
So I actually have no idea
where she is.

06:02.536 --> 06:05.060
Huh. You know what?
I'm just going to, um...

06:05.103 --> 06:08.368
bury these feelings of panic
and dread that I'm experiencing

06:08.411 --> 06:09.412
and, um...

06:09.456 --> 06:10.674
and-and fill you in on the case.

06:10.718 --> 06:12.633
Perfect. Okay.DEEKS: Great.

06:12.676 --> 06:13.764
Just gonna push them down.

06:13.808 --> 06:15.853
'Cause that-that always works.

06:15.897 --> 06:17.725
KENSI:
Eric! Case.Huh? Yes.

06:17.768 --> 06:19.074
SAM:
Please.

06:19.117 --> 06:21.685
ERIC:
Early this morning,
uh, two workers found

06:21.729 --> 06:24.035
a dead body outside a home
in Hancock Park.

06:25.080 --> 06:26.777
Just lying there
in the street?

06:26.821 --> 06:28.779
No, in a dumpster.

06:30.477 --> 06:32.043
I didn't tell you
the body was in a dumpster?

06:32.087 --> 06:34.437
The body was in a dumpster.
Sorry, I'm a little...

06:34.481 --> 06:36.874
distracted
by this whole Nell thing.

06:36.918 --> 06:38.310
It's...
Did she have an appointment?

06:38.354 --> 06:39.268
Eric.

06:39.311 --> 06:40.704
Right.

06:40.748 --> 06:42.314
Uh, Mason Walker.

06:42.358 --> 06:44.055
Uh, he was handling
access control

06:44.099 --> 06:46.884
for a Department of Defense
envoy in Los Angeles.

06:46.928 --> 06:49.713
They were meeting
with various submariners

06:49.757 --> 06:52.237
and, uh, naval-naval-naval...

06:52.281 --> 06:54.544
naval engineers
and submariners,

06:54.588 --> 06:57.895
um, to discuss the
military's next phase

06:57.939 --> 07:00.289
of submarine warfare defense.

07:00.332 --> 07:01.377
SAM:
The U.S. needs
to counter Russia's

07:01.421 --> 07:03.248
new Yasen class of submarines.

07:03.292 --> 07:04.815
Supposedly, they can launch a
missile that can bob and weave

07:04.859 --> 07:06.469
through our
naval missile defense system.

07:06.513 --> 07:07.818
And deliver deadly
nuclear warheads

07:07.862 --> 07:09.385
on unsuspecting targets.

07:09.429 --> 07:11.387
Yeah. That.

07:11.431 --> 07:13.084
We should get somebody
on that stat.

07:13.128 --> 07:14.738
Well, hence the DoD envoy.

07:14.782 --> 07:17.306
Walker was guarding the war room
last night when he was abducted.

07:17.349 --> 07:18.829
CALLEN:
I'm guessing whoever did this

07:18.873 --> 07:20.918
was not after Mason Walker.

07:20.962 --> 07:22.485
They also stole a hard drive

07:22.529 --> 07:24.444
that contained everything
the team had been working on.

07:24.487 --> 07:26.576
Where's the command envoy now?

07:26.620 --> 07:28.404
ERIC:
Um, Commodore Cindy Kang

07:28.448 --> 07:29.405
is waiting for you
at the boatshed.

07:29.449 --> 07:31.015
Tell her we're on our way.

07:31.059 --> 07:32.060
Yeah.

07:36.630 --> 07:38.588
Ugh.

07:38.632 --> 07:40.590
God.Mm-hmm.

07:40.634 --> 07:42.026
You think this is good coffee?

07:42.070 --> 07:45.073
It's better
as a doughnut chaser.

07:45.116 --> 07:48.076
All right,
where have you taken me?

07:48.119 --> 07:49.947
This is my spot.
Wanted you to see it.

07:49.991 --> 07:51.514
Oh, yeah?Mm-hmm.

07:51.558 --> 07:52.776
You come here a lot?

07:52.820 --> 07:54.604
Oh, yeah. All the time.Okay.

07:54.648 --> 07:55.779
What's up, Cool Rick?

07:56.824 --> 07:58.390
He's shy.

07:58.434 --> 08:00.349
Yeah.

08:00.392 --> 08:02.220
Sydney, I...

08:02.264 --> 08:03.831
I think this is
a really nice gesture,

08:03.874 --> 08:05.397
and I think

08:05.441 --> 08:07.661
I would like to spend more time

08:07.704 --> 08:09.750
with you on a regular basis,

08:09.793 --> 08:12.753
but right now I'm super late
for work, so...

08:12.796 --> 08:14.319
Really? What time is it?

08:14.363 --> 08:16.104
Um... Ooh.

08:16.147 --> 08:18.498
Yeah, no, no, I'm insanely late.

08:18.541 --> 08:19.760
Oh, no, I think that's fast.

08:19.803 --> 08:21.370
Wh-What's your phone say?

08:22.850 --> 08:24.504
No, no, still insanely late.

08:24.547 --> 08:25.548
Really?
Um...

08:25.592 --> 08:27.507
Let me see.What are you doing?

08:27.550 --> 08:28.682
Don't do that.

08:28.725 --> 08:29.987
What are you doing?
Don't do--

08:30.031 --> 08:32.512
Oh, my God!

08:32.555 --> 08:34.209
Sydney.

08:34.252 --> 08:36.820
Wait, tha-that's my phone.
I-I need my phone back.

08:36.864 --> 08:39.170
Sis, um, I need a favor.

08:39.214 --> 08:40.824
A... small favor.

08:40.868 --> 08:42.260
Tiny.

08:46.395 --> 08:47.439
Oh, Special Agents.

08:47.483 --> 08:49.180
Did you hear something?
No.

08:49.224 --> 08:50.355
Yoo-hoo.KENSI: Was that a "yoo-hoo"?

08:50.399 --> 08:51.574
Affirmative.

08:51.618 --> 08:53.184
DEEKS:
Guys, I can't deny
a good yoo-hoo.

08:53.228 --> 08:55.622
Yes, you can.No, it's like a more
appropriate catcall.

08:55.665 --> 08:56.666
SAM:
Deeks...

08:56.710 --> 08:58.929
I can't. I just can't.Okay.

08:58.973 --> 09:02.280
Special Prosecutor Rogers,
what can I do you for?

09:02.324 --> 09:04.152
As part of my efforts
to rein in the chaos

09:04.195 --> 09:06.154
that has become status quo
in this office,

09:06.197 --> 09:09.287
I am conducting
performance reviews today.

09:09.331 --> 09:10.550
It's March.

09:10.593 --> 09:11.812
It's the end
of the first quarter.

09:15.598 --> 09:17.557
KENSI:
He's joking.SAM: Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

09:17.600 --> 09:20.255
You're funny.
He's very funny.

09:20.298 --> 09:21.691
Thank you, Agent Hanna.

09:21.735 --> 09:24.302
I also feel like we've developed
a whimsical shorthand,

09:24.346 --> 09:25.869
which is one of the things
I hope to cover

09:25.913 --> 09:28.611
in our timed, individual
conversations today.

09:28.655 --> 09:29.917
And this is mandatory?

09:29.960 --> 09:31.614
Mandatory quarterly reviews,
that's correct.

09:31.658 --> 09:33.442
Detective Deeks,
you're up first.

09:33.485 --> 09:35.487
No...
Aww...

09:35.531 --> 09:36.706
Tough one, babe.

09:36.750 --> 09:38.708
Yeah, we gotta go talk
to the commodore.

09:38.752 --> 09:41.711
And you are the one that can't
ignore a good "yoo-hoo."

09:41.755 --> 09:43.757
You can't.
You just can't.

09:43.800 --> 09:45.323
Mm-mm.
Sorry.

09:45.367 --> 09:46.411
Really?Yep.

09:46.455 --> 09:47.630
Now?
Yep.

09:47.674 --> 09:49.458
Here? Mm-hmm.

09:50.677 --> 09:52.809
KANG:
We're not so much an envoy

09:52.853 --> 09:54.332
as we are a brain trust.

09:54.376 --> 09:56.857
The idea was to get
the brightest naval engineers

09:56.900 --> 09:59.076
in one room, throw some
ideas at the wall

09:59.120 --> 10:00.338
and see what would stick.

10:00.382 --> 10:01.862
Were you getting anywhere?Yes.

10:01.905 --> 10:03.907
We were on our way
to a clear plan

10:03.951 --> 10:06.083
for how to defend ourselves
against the Russian

10:06.127 --> 10:07.607
Yasen class of submarines.

10:07.650 --> 10:09.870
And that was all
on the hard drive?

10:09.913 --> 10:11.219
Walk us through last night.

10:11.262 --> 10:14.439
We worked late, as per usual.

10:14.483 --> 10:16.137
Where were you all set up?

10:16.180 --> 10:17.399
An office building in Westwood.

10:17.442 --> 10:19.401
Everyone around us
is civilian.

10:19.444 --> 10:21.142
We called it at around 0200

10:21.185 --> 10:24.841
and were back at our hotel
maybe 25 minutes later.

10:24.885 --> 10:27.061
And the security guard
stayed behind?Correct.

10:27.104 --> 10:28.932
Mason Walker.

10:28.976 --> 10:31.805
Lovely fellow.
His shift was

10:31.848 --> 10:34.242
supposed to end at 0900.

10:34.285 --> 10:35.852
By then, his body was
in Hancock Park.

10:35.896 --> 10:37.811
Where's the rest of your team?

10:37.854 --> 10:39.987
Back at the hotel,
getting some rest.

10:40.030 --> 10:43.512
We were already running
on fumes before this happened.

10:46.558 --> 10:48.778
What is it?

10:48.822 --> 10:51.912
I haven't been able to get in
touch with one of our engineers.

10:51.955 --> 10:53.130
Andre Martinez.

10:54.479 --> 10:55.742
I'm worried
something may have

10:55.785 --> 10:57.047
happened to him.

10:57.091 --> 10:58.962
Or that...

10:59.006 --> 11:00.660
Or that he was the one
responsible?

11:02.487 --> 11:03.880
How well do
you know him?

11:03.924 --> 11:06.796
I don't. He was a rÃ©sumÃ©
before I met him last week.

11:06.840 --> 11:09.451
But he's young,
he's intelligent

11:09.494 --> 11:11.496
and I'm concerned
he may be dangerous.

11:11.540 --> 11:12.802
SAM:
Hmm.

11:12.846 --> 11:14.586
CALLEN:
All right.

11:14.630 --> 11:16.240
Well, until we know more,
I'm gonna have NCIS pick up

11:16.284 --> 11:17.938
the rest of your team and bring
them here for their own safety.

11:17.981 --> 11:21.593
Thank you. And good luck.

11:21.637 --> 11:23.508
Thank you.

11:23.552 --> 11:25.119
NELL:
You know, this is just like
the froyo incident

11:25.162 --> 11:26.860
that shall not be named.

11:26.903 --> 11:29.036
That was, like,
a million years ago.

11:29.079 --> 11:30.820
Mom punished me,
I said I was sorry,

11:30.864 --> 11:32.430
and you need to let it go.

11:32.474 --> 11:35.390
How can I, when you keep forcing
me to live it out in reruns?

11:35.433 --> 11:38.480
Just be cool for, like,
one second, okay?

11:38.523 --> 11:41.309
Be cool? You want me
to be cool? Okay, yeah.

11:41.352 --> 11:43.528
Uh, how about you
give me my keys back?

11:43.572 --> 11:46.749
No, I know, why don't you
not go and destroy my phone?

11:46.793 --> 11:49.143
And then not go and
destroy your phone?

11:49.186 --> 11:51.711
And, hey,
what are you looking for?

11:51.754 --> 11:52.842
We are standing here
in the middle

11:52.886 --> 11:55.018
of a donut diner parking lot.

11:55.062 --> 11:57.542
No one else is here
except that rando over there,

11:57.586 --> 12:00.371
and-- Wait a second.
Didn't we, like,

12:00.415 --> 12:01.851
go to school with him?
Didn't you,

12:01.895 --> 12:03.810
didn't you have a major... ow.

12:05.420 --> 12:06.856
Did anyone follow you?

12:06.900 --> 12:08.292
I don't know. I couldn't tell.

12:08.336 --> 12:10.947
Okay, Boxcar Children.
What's going on here?

12:10.991 --> 12:12.470
Uh, we need to go.

12:12.514 --> 12:13.907
NELL:
As in the royal "we"?

12:13.950 --> 12:15.952
No, no-- I'm not going
anywhere with you.

12:18.607 --> 12:20.261
SYDNEY:
Nell, we don't have
time to explain.

12:20.304 --> 12:21.784
Do you remember Andre Martinez?

12:21.828 --> 12:23.220
NELL:
I mean,

12:23.264 --> 12:25.570
kind of. Hi. Go Knights.

12:25.614 --> 12:27.485
Well, someone is trying
to kill him.

12:27.529 --> 12:29.966
Please. I need your help.

12:41.761 --> 12:43.937
ROGERS:
Helps me keep track.
Once we get started,

12:43.980 --> 12:45.721
the time just flies,
and I really try

12:45.765 --> 12:47.592
to keep these conversations
to an hour.

12:47.636 --> 12:49.638
: Oh. You think
we're gonna do this for an hour?

12:49.681 --> 12:52.380
Detective Martin Deeks,
without further ado...

12:53.729 --> 12:55.165
...what does it say about you

12:55.209 --> 12:57.951
that you've spent
the last decade

12:57.994 --> 13:01.258
with one foot in LAPD
and one foot in NCIS,

13:01.302 --> 13:05.262
without really being able
to commit to either side?

13:05.306 --> 13:08.439
Wow. I gotta be honest,
I did not expect

13:08.483 --> 13:10.267
this level of insight
from you, Rogers.

13:10.311 --> 13:11.573
Martin?

13:11.616 --> 13:15.142
Can I call you Martin?
"Deeks" feels so bro-ey.

13:15.185 --> 13:16.317
Huh.

13:16.360 --> 13:17.709
Martin,

13:17.753 --> 13:19.320
you have the floor.

13:19.363 --> 13:21.322
So we're doing this, then,
are we?

13:21.365 --> 13:23.150
We are.

13:23.193 --> 13:24.847
All right.

13:24.891 --> 13:26.153
I mean, if I were to

13:26.196 --> 13:29.765
really take a deep dive
into my soul to answer

13:29.809 --> 13:31.071
that question, I'd have to

13:31.114 --> 13:32.899
probably go back
to when I was a kid.

13:32.942 --> 13:35.684
You know?
I was about seven years old.

13:35.727 --> 13:38.643
Yea high, tufts of blonde hair.

13:38.687 --> 13:41.168
And there's this girl,

13:41.211 --> 13:42.952
Jodi Barnes.

13:42.996 --> 13:44.388
She smelled
like vanilla and popcorn

13:44.432 --> 13:46.042
and I used to chase her
at recess and lunch

13:46.086 --> 13:47.043
like it was my job.

13:47.087 --> 13:48.653
And there was
this one morning.

13:48.697 --> 13:52.832
I showed up to school and she,
she wasn't there, you know?

13:52.875 --> 13:55.573
And it was, like, a-- it was a
Tuesday, and it was a weird day

13:55.617 --> 13:57.184
for no-- yeah...ERIC :
Deeks.

13:57.227 --> 13:59.447
In the middle of something?Yeah.

13:59.490 --> 14:01.101
I'm in the middle of something
with Rogers

14:01.144 --> 14:03.320
and it's important
and my clock is ticking.

14:03.364 --> 14:04.495
Why, what's up?

14:04.539 --> 14:06.193
Official business.

14:06.236 --> 14:07.281
Official business...?

14:15.506 --> 14:16.856
I got to go.

14:18.335 --> 14:19.293
I'll be right back.
Can you just--

14:19.336 --> 14:20.468
can we pause it or something?

14:20.511 --> 14:22.470
I don't want to-- Okay.
Sure.

14:22.513 --> 14:23.514
Okay, Beale. What's up?

14:23.558 --> 14:24.733
I'm worried about Nell.

14:24.776 --> 14:26.126
She's not answering her phone.

14:26.169 --> 14:27.127
Maybe she's on the other line
with her best friend

14:27.170 --> 14:28.258
who just got dumped.

14:28.302 --> 14:29.869
Okay, but I can't
locate her phone.

14:29.912 --> 14:31.218
Maybe she didn't
charge it last night.

14:31.261 --> 14:32.654
Okay, but I can't
turn on her phone.

14:32.697 --> 14:33.960
Maybe she dropped it
in the toilet. Listen, Beale,

14:34.003 --> 14:35.700
there are simple explanations
for all these things.

14:35.744 --> 14:36.919
Okay, but the last time
I could locate her phone,

14:36.963 --> 14:37.964
it was at a donut shop.

14:38.007 --> 14:39.574
Which is significant because...

14:39.617 --> 14:41.532
Because Nell hates donuts.What?

14:41.576 --> 14:42.882
Yeah. She calls them
the dregs of the dessert world.

14:42.925 --> 14:44.100
That seems a little harsh.

14:44.144 --> 14:45.754
Deeks, the Penelope Jones
I know and love

14:45.797 --> 14:48.365
would never go to a donut shop
on her own volition.

14:48.409 --> 14:49.758
When's the last time
you talked to her?

14:49.801 --> 14:51.368
She texted me at 8:29.

14:51.412 --> 14:52.543
What does it say?It says

14:52.587 --> 14:53.936
"Running late,"

14:53.980 --> 14:55.372
with an exclamation point.

14:55.416 --> 14:56.591
Yikes. Should we tell Rogers?

14:56.634 --> 14:58.767
No, I-I don't want
to get her in trouble.

14:58.810 --> 15:00.856
Okay, I'll help you out.

15:00.900 --> 15:02.727
You will? Thank you.Of course I will.

15:03.946 --> 15:06.601
Rogers, something came up.
But listen,

15:06.644 --> 15:08.908
this is not good-bye.
This is "I'll see you soon."

15:08.951 --> 15:10.866
I'll bring him right back.Okay.

15:13.347 --> 15:14.478
How you doing?

15:14.522 --> 15:16.698
Pretty well, thank you.Agent Callen.

15:16.741 --> 15:19.614
Oh.Agent Hanna, Agent Blye,
we're from NCIS.

15:19.657 --> 15:21.442
Well, how can I help you?

15:21.485 --> 15:23.270
We are investigating a crime
that may have taken place

15:23.313 --> 15:24.793
in one of your suites
last night.

15:24.836 --> 15:26.403
Hey, can you keep your voices
down, please?

15:26.447 --> 15:27.883
This is a renter's market.

15:27.927 --> 15:29.232
What, are you trying to drive me
out of business?

15:29.276 --> 15:30.973
Depends. You gonna help us out?

15:31.017 --> 15:34.890
Well, I can tell you now that
no one broke in here last night.

15:34.934 --> 15:37.545
How you doing, sir?
Have a good day!

15:37.588 --> 15:39.025
You got any security cameras?

15:39.068 --> 15:40.983
Well, they were on my wish list,

15:41.027 --> 15:43.507
but, uh, Santa thought
I was too naughty.

15:46.293 --> 15:47.990
Do not do that again.

15:48.034 --> 15:49.644
Oh. I thought we had a...

15:49.687 --> 15:50.862
No. You thought wrong.

15:50.906 --> 15:52.342
CALLEN:
Was anyone working
this desk

15:52.386 --> 15:54.214
through the night?
No, sir.

15:54.257 --> 15:56.520
No. No one is here
past 6:00 p.m.

15:56.564 --> 15:59.045
Well, how do people access
the building after hours?

15:59.088 --> 16:02.265
Well, each employee
is assigned a unique keycard.

16:02.309 --> 16:04.180
Great. Can we see the log

16:04.224 --> 16:06.226
of everyone that came in
and out after hours?

16:07.270 --> 16:08.750
Okay.

16:09.925 --> 16:11.666
It's Deeks.

16:11.709 --> 16:13.015
Hey, you're on loudspeaker.

16:13.059 --> 16:15.148
Eric and I looked into
Lieutenant Andre Martinez,

16:15.191 --> 16:16.279
the missing engineer.

16:16.323 --> 16:17.541
You find anything good?

16:17.585 --> 16:20.022
Yep. To the tune of $100,000

16:20.066 --> 16:22.242
deposited into
his bank account this morning.

16:22.285 --> 16:23.460
Suspicious.
Right?

16:23.504 --> 16:24.548
SAM:
Can you trace that deposit?

16:24.592 --> 16:27.247
Uh, I'm trying.
Uh, hey, guys,

16:27.290 --> 16:28.900
uh, just a totally
random side note,

16:28.944 --> 16:30.554
I'm just wondering
if you-- i-if you guys,

16:30.598 --> 16:33.557
um, had any luck, uh, getting
in touch with Nell, 'cause, uh,

16:33.601 --> 16:36.517
Deeks seems to be
pretty worried about her.

16:36.560 --> 16:37.997
Yeah, I'm-- what
was-- what he said.

16:38.040 --> 16:39.911
I was w-worried about her.Mm-hmm.

16:39.955 --> 16:42.479
I am sure there's a
perfectly good explanation

16:42.523 --> 16:44.307
as to why she is late.

16:44.351 --> 16:45.830
Y-Yeah, no, no, totally.

16:45.874 --> 16:48.746
That's, that's what
I keep telling Deeks.

16:48.790 --> 16:51.488
Hey, guys, we'll call you back.

16:51.532 --> 16:52.794
Well, actually,

16:52.837 --> 16:54.143
it was very quiet here
last night.

16:54.187 --> 16:57.103
Only two people used
their keycard after hours.

16:57.146 --> 17:00.410
You know, it's actually
the same person.

17:00.454 --> 17:01.672
Once at 3:14 a.m.

17:01.716 --> 17:03.761
and another time at 4:47 a.m.

17:03.805 --> 17:05.198
You got a name?

17:05.241 --> 17:07.330
Yeah, it was an Andre Martinez.
Does that help at all?

17:07.374 --> 17:09.245
Yes, it does.

17:09.289 --> 17:11.247
Can I see that?
This is...

17:15.077 --> 17:16.513
Thank you.You're taking it?

17:16.557 --> 17:17.862
We'll get it back to you.

17:17.906 --> 17:20.169
I didn't give an affirmative.

17:20.213 --> 17:22.389
Okay.

17:25.218 --> 17:27.611
We need Eric
to profile Andre Martinez.

17:27.655 --> 17:29.396
He's working on it.Then when he's done with that...

17:29.439 --> 17:31.180
He's gonna find him. We know.

17:31.224 --> 17:33.052
Which means: Callen, you're up.

17:33.965 --> 17:34.923
We're in the middle

17:34.966 --> 17:36.577
of a case right now.

17:36.620 --> 17:39.101
You and I both know that there
is a lull in the investigation.

17:39.145 --> 17:41.756
You are waiting for information
to come in so it can inform

17:41.799 --> 17:43.932
your next move
and I'd like to take advantage.

17:43.975 --> 17:45.934
Meet me at the couches.
It'll be fun.

17:45.977 --> 17:47.631
Can't wait.

17:48.937 --> 17:51.287
Hey. How bad was it?

17:51.331 --> 17:52.723
Not bad.

17:52.767 --> 17:53.811
Incredible.

17:53.855 --> 17:55.117
So, incredibly bad.

17:55.161 --> 17:57.206
I don't know how to explain it.

17:57.250 --> 17:59.426
So bad you can't find the words.

17:59.469 --> 18:00.688
DEEKS:
If I have one
piece of advice,

18:00.731 --> 18:02.733
it's to savor every minute
of that hour,

18:02.777 --> 18:04.779
because that man is a gift.

18:05.780 --> 18:06.998
Are you okay?

18:07.042 --> 18:08.043
I feel great.

18:09.436 --> 18:11.394
Guys, I need
to show you something.

18:11.438 --> 18:12.700
Upstairs.

18:12.743 --> 18:14.615
Oh. Sorry there, Rogers.

18:14.658 --> 18:15.920
Duty calls.

18:19.794 --> 18:22.405
What's going on?

18:22.449 --> 18:24.364
Beale.

18:24.407 --> 18:25.887
She didn't have an appointment.

18:25.930 --> 18:27.497
Unless the appointment
was with him.

18:27.541 --> 18:28.977
And if that's the case, that
opens an entirely different

18:29.020 --> 18:30.544
realm of possibilities
that I haven't

18:30.587 --> 18:32.023
even considered
until this very moment.

18:32.067 --> 18:33.503
Beale.
Yeah?

18:33.547 --> 18:34.722
English.

18:34.765 --> 18:36.680
It's more of a show,
not tell situation.

18:36.724 --> 18:37.899
Okay.

18:40.597 --> 18:42.860
Why are we looking
at a photo of Nell?And Sydney.

18:42.904 --> 18:45.646
That's actually pretty cute.
They're getting along, kind of.

18:45.689 --> 18:47.648
I thought you were
investigating Andre Martinez.

18:47.691 --> 18:48.823
ERIC:
That's what I'm
trying to tell you.

18:48.866 --> 18:50.172
The guy in the picture with Nell

18:50.216 --> 18:51.869
is Andre Martinez.

18:51.913 --> 18:53.219
KENSI:
What?

18:53.262 --> 18:54.568
When was this
picture taken?

18:54.611 --> 18:56.047
Three hours ago.

18:56.091 --> 18:57.614
And I have no idea
where they are now.

19:02.141 --> 19:03.664
This is gross.

19:03.707 --> 19:05.144
Why are we here?

19:05.187 --> 19:06.884
Because I've been avoiding
security cameras

19:06.928 --> 19:08.843
and traffic cameras
and satellite cameras

19:08.886 --> 19:11.672
until I can figure out
what the hell is going on here.

19:11.715 --> 19:13.108
Okay, that makes sense.

19:13.152 --> 19:14.370
All right, Andre,

19:14.414 --> 19:16.111
if you're in so much danger,
please remind me

19:16.155 --> 19:19.636
why we can't go to the
authorities or at least NCIS?

19:19.680 --> 19:21.203
Because the authorities
are the ones trying to kill me.

19:21.247 --> 19:22.813
And if there's something
rotten at the DoD,

19:22.857 --> 19:25.294
then NCIS may
also be compromised.

19:25.338 --> 19:26.643
NELL:
Okay,

19:26.687 --> 19:28.471
so why do you trust me?

19:28.515 --> 19:30.038
You were always nice.

19:31.039 --> 19:32.780
You lent me a pencil
in Calc BC once.

19:32.823 --> 19:34.347
SYDNEY:
Hey.

19:34.390 --> 19:36.349
You never told me you two
were in a class together.

19:36.392 --> 19:38.394
Oh, control your emotions.
It was a pencil,

19:38.438 --> 19:39.656
and it was a million years ago.

19:39.700 --> 19:41.310
ANDRE:
Look, someone attacked me

19:41.354 --> 19:43.269
in my hotel room this morning.

19:43.312 --> 19:45.053
I don't trust my team.

19:45.096 --> 19:47.534
All right, you... you've got
to help me out here.

19:47.577 --> 19:49.492
Why would somebody be after you?

19:49.536 --> 19:51.842
I'm not sure. I just know
I need to keep moving.

19:51.886 --> 19:53.540
You have to trust me.

19:53.583 --> 19:57.326
I mean, technically, no,
I-I don't have to trust you.

19:57.370 --> 19:59.850
Nell, please.

19:59.894 --> 20:01.374
Do it for me.

20:01.417 --> 20:02.505
That's not helping.

20:02.549 --> 20:03.898
That's definitely not helping.

20:07.510 --> 20:09.033
Okay.

20:09.077 --> 20:10.296
Wait, where are you going?
What are you doing?

20:10.339 --> 20:12.733
NCIS is gonna
be looking for my car,

20:12.776 --> 20:14.952
either because you're in it,
or because I didn't show up

20:14.996 --> 20:17.433
at work today,
so now, we have to ditch it.

20:17.477 --> 20:19.348
Yeah.

20:24.353 --> 20:26.355
Hey. You guys coming?

20:26.399 --> 20:27.487
Thank you.Yeah.

20:36.060 --> 20:39.194
Wait, we're walking? In L.A.?

20:40.761 --> 20:43.067
This is gross.

20:52.686 --> 20:54.209
There has to be
an explanation for this.

20:54.253 --> 20:56.559
Of course there is.Obviously.

20:56.603 --> 20:57.995
Really?

20:58.039 --> 20:59.997
Nobody else is gonna say it?

21:00.041 --> 21:01.477
I mean, it hasn't
occurred to anybody else

21:01.521 --> 21:03.827
that Nell Jones
is Keyser Soze-ing us?

21:03.871 --> 21:05.829
For a decade?For a decade.

21:05.873 --> 21:07.614
No, Deeks.

21:07.657 --> 21:09.572
You're the only one
that's twisted enough
to think like that.

21:09.616 --> 21:11.618
But now I planted the seed,
didn't I?CALLEN: Okay.

21:11.661 --> 21:12.836
We need to piece
together what happened

21:12.880 --> 21:14.577
this morning between
3:00 and 8:00 a.m.

21:14.621 --> 21:16.318
And why Andre Martinez
went back to the office

21:16.362 --> 21:18.494
after everyone
went home, twice.

21:18.538 --> 21:20.801
And who killed Mason Walker,
the guard manning said office.

21:20.844 --> 21:21.976
DEEKS:
And, finally,

21:22.019 --> 21:23.325
why our very own Nell Jones

21:23.369 --> 21:25.022
was hanging out with
Andre Martinez this morning,

21:25.066 --> 21:28.069
if, in fact,
she was not Keyser Soze-ing us.

21:28.112 --> 21:30.506
KENSI:
Huh.What should we do about Rogers?

21:30.550 --> 21:31.942
We're investigating
this from all sides.

21:31.986 --> 21:33.335
I don't think we
tell him about Nell

21:33.379 --> 21:34.641
until we have
something concrete.

21:34.684 --> 21:35.990
KENSI:
Mm-hmm.

21:36.033 --> 21:38.427
Because there has to be
an explanation for it.

21:44.564 --> 21:46.392
This is it, this is the end.Oh, God.

21:54.138 --> 21:56.271
Okay.

21:58.012 --> 21:59.883
Whoa.

21:59.927 --> 22:01.232
NELL:
You all right?

22:01.276 --> 22:02.799
Yes.

22:02.843 --> 22:04.235
Thank you.

22:06.194 --> 22:08.544
I'm so sorry to be putting you
in the middle of this.

22:08.588 --> 22:11.025
Look, as soon as we
get somewhere safe,

22:11.068 --> 22:12.983
you are telling me
everything.

22:13.027 --> 22:14.420
Understood, of course.

22:14.463 --> 22:16.335
No, I don't know
what I would do without you.

22:18.554 --> 22:21.078
That's... that's very sweet.

22:23.254 --> 22:24.473
What?

22:31.045 --> 22:32.655
How you holding up?

22:32.699 --> 22:35.005
Morale's not great.

22:35.049 --> 22:36.442
We not only lost someone,

22:36.485 --> 22:38.269
we lost a lot of ground.

22:38.313 --> 22:40.097
If that hard drive somehow
ends up in Russian hands...

22:40.141 --> 22:42.099
We appreciate what's at stake.

22:42.143 --> 22:43.492
Tell your people
we're trying

22:43.536 --> 22:45.059
everything we can to recover it.

22:45.102 --> 22:46.669
I will.

22:47.757 --> 22:49.237
What about Andre Martinez?

22:49.280 --> 22:51.413
He's MIA, isn't he?

22:51.457 --> 22:54.242
Well, he can run,
but he can't hide.

22:54.285 --> 22:56.549
SAM: We did find
$100,000 deposited

22:56.592 --> 22:59.116
into his bank
account this morning.

22:59.160 --> 23:01.031
I had a bad feeling
about that kid.

23:01.075 --> 23:02.381
We all did.

23:02.424 --> 23:04.339
We'll be in touch.

23:08.822 --> 23:10.954
She's trying too hard.

23:10.998 --> 23:13.130
Keeps breaking
eye contact with us.

23:13.174 --> 23:14.958
Almost as if she
wants us to think

23:15.002 --> 23:17.091
this is about
Andre Martinez.

23:19.093 --> 23:20.355
Call me if the
commodore leaves.

23:20.399 --> 23:21.661
Don't let her out
of your sight.

23:27.710 --> 23:29.930
I've got Andre Martinez's
cell phone activity,

23:29.973 --> 23:31.366
his hotel room...

23:31.410 --> 23:33.324
Agent Blye.Rogers!

23:33.368 --> 23:35.457
Can I steal you away,
Agent Blye?

23:35.501 --> 23:37.067
Oh.  Yeah.

23:37.111 --> 23:39.853
Take me, take me. Wasn't me,
it was the one-armed man.

23:41.550 --> 23:43.422
Yeah, that didn't feel right.

23:43.465 --> 23:45.206
A-After you, we can go and...

23:45.249 --> 23:46.686
talk about how awkward that was.

23:46.729 --> 23:48.470
Yes, let's.
Mm-hmm.

23:56.696 --> 23:58.219
Why are we here?

23:58.262 --> 24:00.482
Because I need Andre here
to tell me everything

24:00.526 --> 24:01.788
that happened this morning.

24:01.831 --> 24:03.703
And because after
he does so, I'm probably

24:03.746 --> 24:06.532
going to need
some time and space

24:06.575 --> 24:08.272
to just clear my thoughts.

24:08.316 --> 24:10.449
It was a rhetorical
question.

24:10.492 --> 24:11.667
Okay.

24:11.711 --> 24:12.973
Andre, are you ready to talk?

24:13.016 --> 24:15.497
I think you deserve that much.

24:15.541 --> 24:16.585
Well, thank you.

24:16.629 --> 24:18.500
So, let's start
at the beginning.

24:19.545 --> 24:20.763
DEEKS:
So, the DoD envoy

24:20.807 --> 24:22.504
finishes work,
heads back to the hotel.

24:22.548 --> 24:24.550
Commodore Kang has them
getting there

24:24.593 --> 24:26.856
at 2:30 in the morning.All right.
That checks out.

24:26.900 --> 24:28.684
That's when everyone
checked into their rooms

24:28.728 --> 24:30.251
including...
Andre Martinez.

24:30.294 --> 24:32.079
So we just got to figure out
what happens next.Yeah.

24:32.122 --> 24:33.820
I was already asleep
when my phone rang.

24:33.863 --> 24:35.517
It was the commodore, asking me

24:35.561 --> 24:36.866
to go back to the office
and check on the hard drives.

24:36.910 --> 24:39.608
That didn't strike
you as strange?

24:39.652 --> 24:41.175
She's my boss;
I didn't question it.

24:41.218 --> 24:42.611
I called a Lyft.

24:42.655 --> 24:43.960
ERIC: So, after the call
from the commodore,

24:44.004 --> 24:46.354
Andre Martinez
gets in a Lyft

24:46.397 --> 24:49.183
and goes from the hotel
back to the building.

24:49.226 --> 24:51.620
Yep, security log.
Keycard 3:14 a.m.Uh-huh.

24:51.664 --> 24:53.927
And then he gets
back into a Lyft,

24:53.970 --> 24:55.842
goes from the building
back to the hotel

24:55.885 --> 24:58.671
at... 3:42 a.m.

24:58.714 --> 25:00.237
So why go to the building twice?

25:00.281 --> 25:01.848
ANDRE:
When I got to the hotel,

25:01.891 --> 25:04.503
I realized my keycard was gone.

25:04.546 --> 25:06.200
Did you maybe leave it
at your office?

25:06.243 --> 25:08.028
No, I'm pretty sure
it was stolen.

25:08.071 --> 25:09.551
How? The only other
person you saw

25:09.595 --> 25:11.205
was your Lyft driver.

25:11.248 --> 25:14.077
Exactly. Who just happened
to be in a deserted

25:14.121 --> 25:15.992
business district at
three-something in the morning.

25:16.036 --> 25:18.429
You think he was
waiting for you.

25:18.473 --> 25:19.474
Have you ever seen a Lyft driver

25:19.518 --> 25:20.649
get out the car
and open the door?

25:20.693 --> 25:21.955
Oh, hell no.

25:21.998 --> 25:23.652
I would have
one-starred that ride.

25:25.306 --> 25:26.916
And then Martinez
and Commodore Kang talk again

25:26.960 --> 25:29.702
at 4:02, but this time,
Martinez calls her.

25:29.745 --> 25:32.052
And the commodore didn't mention
either one of these phone calls?

25:32.095 --> 25:33.706
Nope.

25:33.749 --> 25:35.708
Commodore Kang was great.
It was 4:00 in the morning,

25:35.751 --> 25:37.361
but she was so helpful.

25:37.405 --> 25:39.102
We hang up,
and the next thing I know,

25:39.146 --> 25:41.452
someone's at my door--
I assumed it was her.

25:41.496 --> 25:43.977
It was some guy
I'd never seen before.

25:44.020 --> 25:46.109
Who gave me this, this...

25:46.153 --> 25:47.589
and this.

25:47.633 --> 25:50.418
Okay.I don't think he expected me
to fight back.

25:50.461 --> 25:52.899
I got a few good punches in
before he took off.

25:52.942 --> 25:55.902
You have to understand,
I don't know the other people

25:55.945 --> 25:57.860
on my team;
we all just met.

25:57.904 --> 26:00.428
One of them could have
set me up.

26:00.471 --> 26:02.343
And Andre Martinez
falls into a black hole

26:02.386 --> 26:04.650
until he pops up again
at the donut shop with Nell.

26:04.693 --> 26:06.782
And Sydney, don't forget
that Sydney is there.

26:06.826 --> 26:09.263
Yeah, maybe Sydney's
to blame for all this.

26:09.306 --> 26:10.960
Yeah...Hey, maybe Andre Martinez

26:11.004 --> 26:12.396
is connected to her.

26:12.440 --> 26:14.442
Hmm. Oh, my God.

26:14.485 --> 26:16.487
Not yet--!
Wait, hold on.

26:16.531 --> 26:18.359
Uh, I need you not to...

26:18.402 --> 26:20.143
f-freak out.What? What?

26:20.187 --> 26:23.103
Why would you say that? Now
I'm freaking out based solely

26:23.146 --> 26:24.626
on the fact that you told me
not to freak out.

26:24.670 --> 26:26.454
Because Andre Martinez

26:26.497 --> 26:28.021
might actually
be connected to Nell.

26:29.500 --> 26:31.285
At the lips.

26:31.328 --> 26:33.983
Don't freak out.

26:39.467 --> 26:42.383
What is happening?

26:42.426 --> 26:44.211
I have to get
a message to my team.

26:44.254 --> 26:45.865
I don't think it's safe
to contact NCIS.

26:45.908 --> 26:47.475
NELL: I don't know
how much longer

26:47.518 --> 26:48.955
we can keep this up.

26:48.998 --> 26:52.219
And I'm not contacting NCIS,
I'm contacting my people.

26:52.262 --> 26:53.742
I trust them.

26:53.786 --> 26:54.961
Must be nice.

26:55.004 --> 26:57.703
I can't work this case
on the run.

26:57.746 --> 27:00.444
Harrison Ford did it.

27:00.488 --> 27:02.142
That's not helping.

27:02.185 --> 27:03.491
That's definitely not helping.

27:03.534 --> 27:04.753
NELL:
Look, it's the only way

27:04.797 --> 27:06.799
we're going to truly know
who's after you

27:06.842 --> 27:09.279
and keep us all alive.

27:09.323 --> 27:11.499
Alive?And hopefully out of jail.

27:11.542 --> 27:12.979
Jail?

27:13.022 --> 27:14.502
Uh-uh.

27:31.650 --> 27:33.129
Mm.

27:33.173 --> 27:34.827
What's up?
What's the word?

27:36.829 --> 27:38.439
Oh.

27:38.482 --> 27:40.180
All right, well, thanks
for the heads-up.

27:40.223 --> 27:42.095
We're on our way.

27:42.138 --> 27:43.879
Commodore Kang's
on the move?

27:43.923 --> 27:45.794
She went out for
some fresh air.

27:45.838 --> 27:47.840
And didn't invite any
of her team to join her.

27:47.883 --> 27:49.668
You don't say?

27:57.153 --> 27:59.678
You sure
this is gonna work?Uh, nope.

27:59.721 --> 28:02.158
But you're pretty sure
it'll work?

28:02.202 --> 28:03.943
Nope.

28:03.986 --> 28:05.422
But it's worked before?

28:05.466 --> 28:06.989
No.

28:07.033 --> 28:08.512
Do you see
how impossible she is?

28:08.556 --> 28:10.732
Show a little respect.

28:10.776 --> 28:13.517
Artists are supposed
to be difficult.

28:13.561 --> 28:16.216
Oh. Thank you.

28:16.259 --> 28:17.696
Why don't you
just ditch her?

28:17.739 --> 28:19.349
Believe me, I've tried.

28:19.393 --> 28:21.308
Girl has so much
toxic energy.

28:21.351 --> 28:23.397
Yeah, well,
she's also my sister.

28:23.440 --> 28:26.313
So...So you're like, stuck.

28:26.356 --> 28:28.315
That sucks.

28:28.358 --> 28:30.578
Hey, I am standing
right here.

28:30.621 --> 28:32.711
I can hear everything
you're saying about me.

28:32.754 --> 28:33.799
I know.

28:33.842 --> 28:35.801
"Suicide is painless."

28:35.844 --> 28:37.498
Are you sure
this is gonna work?

28:37.541 --> 28:40.327
Asked and answered, my friend.

28:40.370 --> 28:42.024
Hayley, thank you.

28:42.068 --> 28:44.331
You, your car and this here
can of hot pink spray paint

28:44.374 --> 28:47.247
have been, uh, real life-savers.

28:47.290 --> 28:48.988
Now, please, go forth and drive.

28:49.031 --> 28:51.512
Preferably three times
around the block

28:51.555 --> 28:52.818
at La Cienega and Melrose.
Cool?

28:52.861 --> 28:54.080
Gnarly.

28:54.123 --> 28:56.299
Hey, uh, can I
ask you a question?

28:56.343 --> 28:59.476
Yeah, shoot.You're leaving a message
for your boyfriend, right?

28:59.520 --> 29:01.087
Right.

29:01.130 --> 29:03.219
Are you sure you don't
want to just text him?

29:03.263 --> 29:05.831
Because that's how
everyone does it now.

29:05.874 --> 29:08.355
You make a really good
point, Hayls.

29:08.398 --> 29:09.922
And I totally would,

29:09.965 --> 29:12.968
but if my friend's envoy's
been compromised,

29:13.012 --> 29:14.361
then the DoD
is gonna be, like,

29:14.404 --> 29:16.015
all over everyone
and everything.

29:17.233 --> 29:18.278
But...?

29:18.321 --> 29:20.367
But if Eric finds this,

29:20.410 --> 29:21.760
then he can help us.

29:21.803 --> 29:24.110
So long as he doesn't also
find out you kissed Andre.

29:24.153 --> 29:25.807
Okay.

29:25.851 --> 29:29.419
DoD, oh! Is that
like, denim on denim?

29:29.463 --> 29:31.030
Gross.

29:31.073 --> 29:32.466
Yeah, right.
Just get in the car.

29:32.509 --> 29:33.859
Get in the car. Everyone in.

29:33.902 --> 29:35.904
Go, go, go, go, go, go.

29:44.870 --> 29:46.828
CALLEN:
Maybe...

29:46.872 --> 29:48.569
Commodore Kang really is
just out for a walk.

29:48.612 --> 29:50.223
Maybe she isn't.

30:12.854 --> 30:14.290
There's someone
in the driver's seat.

30:16.292 --> 30:17.250
Yeah.

30:19.165 --> 30:21.210
I'll send a picture
to Eric now.

30:21.254 --> 30:23.082
You know what this means?

30:23.125 --> 30:24.910
What?
She lied to us.

30:24.953 --> 30:26.868
I hate when
they do that.

30:26.912 --> 30:28.652
It is the worst.

30:28.696 --> 30:30.437
The woman Commodore Kang
is meeting with

30:30.480 --> 30:32.308
is named Natasia Yashnova.

30:32.352 --> 30:33.875
She's a Russian
national and her father

30:33.919 --> 30:36.182
has ties to
Putin and the KGB.

30:36.225 --> 30:38.445
So the Russians might be after
the missing hard drive.

30:38.488 --> 30:40.795
Or the Russians already have
the missing hard drive.

30:40.839 --> 30:43.102
So, basically,
our worst fears confirmed.

30:43.145 --> 30:44.973
Maybe Andre Martinez

30:45.017 --> 30:46.845
has nothing to do with
it being stolen...

30:46.888 --> 30:48.194
or Mason Walker's murder,

30:48.237 --> 30:50.370
or the 100K being deposited
in his account.

30:50.413 --> 30:53.373
Or Andre Martinez is also
working with the Russians.

30:53.416 --> 30:54.722
You know...

30:54.765 --> 30:56.463
it's thin, but...

30:56.506 --> 30:58.117
there is a silver lining.

30:58.160 --> 31:01.468
Kensi. My girlfriend is on the
run with a suspected traitor.

31:01.511 --> 31:03.252
It's not that bad.And murderer.

31:03.296 --> 31:04.645
It's not great.

31:04.688 --> 31:06.038
And I have hard evidence

31:06.081 --> 31:07.822
proving their relationship
is more than platonic.

31:07.866 --> 31:10.129
You're having what
the kids call "a rough day."

31:10.172 --> 31:12.392
I'll take a microscopic sliver

31:12.435 --> 31:13.828
of a silver lining
at this point.

31:13.872 --> 31:15.395
Okay.

31:15.438 --> 31:17.658
Andre Martinez
is a loose end.

31:17.701 --> 31:20.661
Something that Commodore Kang
will not leave untied.Exactly.

31:20.704 --> 31:22.706
That's my sliver?

31:22.750 --> 31:25.361
If he's still alive
and we find him,

31:25.405 --> 31:28.364
then we can use
that to find Nell.

31:28.408 --> 31:29.844
Boom.

31:29.888 --> 31:32.107
Well, then I should tell you

31:32.151 --> 31:35.154
that Andre Martinez is alive,
he is with Nell

31:35.197 --> 31:36.677
and I know exactly
where they are.

31:36.720 --> 31:38.157
BOTH:
What?

31:38.200 --> 31:39.680
No. You just...You've been
holding out on us?

31:42.030 --> 31:43.510
Guys, it's complicated.

31:43.553 --> 31:44.946
This is a very complicated case

31:44.990 --> 31:46.382
and I have complicated
feelings about it.

31:46.426 --> 31:47.993
Eric, where is Andre Martinez?

31:48.036 --> 31:49.864
Have you located him?

31:49.908 --> 31:53.650
Yes, he's in Malibu
Creek State Park,

31:53.694 --> 31:56.088
at the old MÃ¡*AÃ¡SÃ¡*Hsite.

31:56.131 --> 31:58.829
Excellent work, Eric.
Truly top-notch.

31:58.873 --> 32:00.527
Yeah. Thank you.

32:00.570 --> 32:02.181
How did you know this, exactly?

32:02.224 --> 32:06.881
Nell sent me a message.
In hot pink.

32:06.925 --> 32:09.753
Oh, that tracks.What?!

32:10.841 --> 32:12.626
CALLEN: Something's up.

32:12.669 --> 32:13.670
No kidding.

32:15.237 --> 32:17.457
Let's roll.

32:24.420 --> 32:26.335
Callen, you guys stay with
Natasia and Commodore Kang.

32:26.379 --> 32:27.989
Deeks and I are gonna
find Andre Martinez.

32:28.033 --> 32:30.383
Eric located him at
Malibu Creek State Park.

32:30.426 --> 32:31.775
Okay, will do. Bye.

32:31.819 --> 32:34.300
Heading out to find
the elusive Andre Martinez?

32:34.343 --> 32:35.823
That we are.

32:35.866 --> 32:37.564
Well, no huge rush, no need
to push the speed limit

32:37.607 --> 32:39.174
getting there; safety first.

32:39.218 --> 32:40.828
Good to know.
Why is that?

32:40.871 --> 32:42.134
I just spoke to Commodore Kang,

32:42.177 --> 32:43.874
and she also happens
to be headed

32:43.918 --> 32:46.225
out to Malibu Creek State Park.
What are the odds?

32:46.268 --> 32:49.358
So, to clarify, y-you spoke
to Commodore Kang?

32:49.402 --> 32:50.359
A-And gave her

32:50.403 --> 32:51.621
Andre Martinez' location?

32:51.665 --> 32:54.015
At the old MÃ¡*AÃ¡SÃ¡*H site, yes.

32:54.059 --> 32:56.191
Oh...

32:56.235 --> 32:57.192
He did not.
Oh, my God,
oh, my God, oh, my God....

32:57.236 --> 32:59.107
Agent Blye, Detective Deeks,

32:59.151 --> 33:00.804
what, exactly, is the issue?

33:02.284 --> 33:04.939
Nell is not actually
home sick today.

33:04.983 --> 33:06.245
Okay? She has been

33:06.288 --> 33:08.508
with Andre Martinez since...

33:08.551 --> 33:09.596
8:30....8:30 this morning,

33:09.639 --> 33:11.032
more or less,
and the only reason

33:11.076 --> 33:12.251
we didn't say anything is
because we didn't really know

33:12.294 --> 33:13.382
how to process that ourselves.

33:13.426 --> 33:14.862
And also, you probably
shouldn't have

33:14.905 --> 33:17.691
told Commodore Kang
what their location is,

33:17.734 --> 33:20.520
because it seems like she's
in bed with the Russians.

33:20.563 --> 33:23.349
But now that I have
told Commodore Kang...

33:23.392 --> 33:25.003
The Russians are probably headed
straight to Nell,

33:25.046 --> 33:26.439
her sister Sydney
and Andre Martinez.

33:26.482 --> 33:28.615
And we have no way
of warning them.

33:41.410 --> 33:42.629
KENSI: That's it,
Callen just confirmed

33:42.672 --> 33:44.631
that Commodore Kang
and Natasia Yashnova

33:44.674 --> 33:46.850
are on their way
to Malibu Creek right now.Excuse me.

33:46.894 --> 33:48.461
Good news is that Sam and Callen
can handle those two.

33:48.504 --> 33:50.071
I said excuse me.

33:50.115 --> 33:51.246
Yeah, but we have no idea
how many Russians

33:51.290 --> 33:52.465
they're working with,
and how many of them

33:52.508 --> 33:53.901
are gonna surprise Nell,
her sister Sydney

33:53.944 --> 33:55.250
and Andre Martinez.

33:55.294 --> 33:57.252
Agent Blye and
Detective Deeks!

33:57.296 --> 33:58.906
Yes.

33:58.949 --> 34:00.690
Are you to tell me
that you and your team

34:00.734 --> 34:02.736
purposefully withheld
vital information from me,

34:02.779 --> 34:04.477
and because of
that withholding,

34:04.520 --> 34:07.306
I inadvertently put
Intelligence Analyst Nell Jones

34:07.349 --> 34:09.090
in harm's way?

34:09.134 --> 34:11.223
Yes, sir.

34:11.266 --> 34:13.312
What do I have to do
to convince you

34:13.355 --> 34:16.141
that I am here as an asset,
that we are on the same team?

34:16.184 --> 34:17.794
Look, Rogers,
you have to understand...

34:17.838 --> 34:19.405
I don't have time for
explanations and neither do you.

34:19.448 --> 34:21.102
Kensi, get to Malibu
as quickly as you can,

34:21.146 --> 34:24.018
and Deeks, I want you
up at Ops with Eric.

34:24.062 --> 34:25.237
Rogers, I don't think I should--

34:28.544 --> 34:30.677
Understood.
Be safe.
Yeah.

34:52.264 --> 34:53.917
CALLEN: You think they're
meeting anyone else?

34:53.961 --> 34:56.311
If they are, they
haven't arrived yet.

34:56.355 --> 34:58.008
Well, let's take care of them
before they do.

34:58.052 --> 35:00.054
You read my mind.

35:03.449 --> 35:05.103
ANDRE: How much longer
until we get there?

35:05.146 --> 35:06.321
NELL:
Uh, a mile, maybe two.

35:06.365 --> 35:07.496
We're getting close now.

35:07.540 --> 35:09.455
SYDNEY:
You guys, I know we're here

35:09.498 --> 35:11.631
under not-fantastic
circumstances,

35:11.674 --> 35:14.460
but you have to admit
this place is gorgeous.

35:14.503 --> 35:15.983
It's not bad.

35:16.026 --> 35:18.725
If I lived in L.A., I'd
come here all the time.

35:18.768 --> 35:21.771
Oh, are you thinking
about moving out here?

35:21.815 --> 35:24.296
Really? Like when all the people
trying to kill you thing

35:24.339 --> 35:25.601
is over?Come on, guys.

35:25.645 --> 35:27.473
This hill ain't gonna
hike itself.

35:30.128 --> 35:31.390
Commodore Kang.

35:33.131 --> 35:35.176
That's quite a walk
you're taking.

35:35.220 --> 35:37.309
Agent Callen.

35:37.352 --> 35:38.919
Don't worry,
everything's fine.

35:40.486 --> 35:42.270
What are you doing here?

35:42.314 --> 35:44.533
What am I doing here?

35:44.577 --> 35:46.448
Sam, did you hear that?
She wants to know

35:46.492 --> 35:47.580
what I'm doing here.

35:47.623 --> 35:48.711
Surprise.

36:04.118 --> 36:06.076
Expected more out of you.

36:15.390 --> 36:16.913
Looks like you guys
have been busy.

36:16.957 --> 36:20.178
Not busy enough. Their friends
still haven't arrived yet.

36:20.221 --> 36:21.788
You ready to tell us
where they are?

36:21.831 --> 36:26.184
You know that cooperation does
go a long way at sentencing.

36:26.227 --> 36:28.534
Actually, who am I kidding?
Murder and treason?

36:28.577 --> 36:30.536
I can't even help you now.

36:32.451 --> 36:33.887
Motorcycles.

36:33.930 --> 36:35.149
That must be how
the Russians are

36:35.193 --> 36:36.585
getting up to
the MÃ¡*AÃ¡SÃ¡*H site.

36:36.629 --> 36:38.718
These trails are too narrow
for our cars.

36:38.761 --> 36:40.589
Even Sam can't outrun a bike.

36:41.634 --> 36:43.723
You know what?
I got an idea.

36:43.766 --> 36:46.204
Excuse me.

36:46.247 --> 36:49.250
I'm Special Agent
Kensi Blye, NCIS.

36:49.294 --> 36:50.512
I need your horse.

36:50.556 --> 36:51.948
You're kidding, right?

36:52.949 --> 36:54.690
No.
You know what?

36:54.734 --> 36:56.562
I realize this is
your beautiful baby,

36:56.605 --> 36:57.563
but we need to borrow him.

36:57.606 --> 36:58.868
No.

36:58.912 --> 37:00.609
It's for a federal emergency.

37:00.653 --> 37:02.307
Seriously?
Seriously.

37:02.350 --> 37:03.482
Ma'am, get off the horse.

37:03.525 --> 37:05.527
SAM: Come on,
come on, come on.

37:05.571 --> 37:06.528
Let's go.

37:06.572 --> 37:08.138
Thank you.

37:09.183 --> 37:10.880
All right.

37:10.924 --> 37:13.535
Meet me at the trail head.
Thank you.

37:13.579 --> 37:14.754
KENSI: Let's go.CALLEN:
Yeah.

37:14.797 --> 37:16.582
Only in L.A.
SAM:
Follow us, ma'am.

37:16.625 --> 37:18.627
CALLEN:
Meet you there.

37:20.281 --> 37:21.326
KENSI :
Eric, how much further

37:21.369 --> 37:22.675
until I'm at the MÃ¡*AÃ¡SÃ¡*H site?

37:22.718 --> 37:24.981
Uh, less than three miles.
You're making good time.

37:25.025 --> 37:26.592
What about the Russians?
I can't hear them anymore.

37:26.635 --> 37:29.029
We've got eyes on two of them.
They're both due east.

37:29.072 --> 37:31.031
Two, huh?
Yeah, I can handle two.

37:31.074 --> 37:33.686
Wait a minute,
do I hear galloping?

37:33.729 --> 37:35.209
Are you on a horse?

37:43.783 --> 37:44.871
And now?

37:44.914 --> 37:47.352
And now we wait.

37:49.876 --> 37:52.748
Is that a motorcycle?

37:52.792 --> 37:56.099
No. I'm getting horse hooves
loud and clear.

37:56.143 --> 37:58.145
One of those things
would be okay, maybe,

37:58.188 --> 38:00.452
but both at the same time

38:00.495 --> 38:02.323
coming from different
directions? Definitely not.

38:02.367 --> 38:03.759
What do we do?

38:03.803 --> 38:05.413
The only thing we can do.
We run.

38:05.457 --> 38:07.459
Go, go, go, go, go,
go, go, go, go, go.

38:34.573 --> 38:36.531
Hyah.

38:40.883 --> 38:42.972
Federal agents. Stop!NELL: Whoa-- Callen, Sam.

38:43.016 --> 38:44.670
You made it.

38:44.713 --> 38:46.715
Got here as fast
as we could.

38:46.759 --> 38:48.804
How you holding up?

38:48.848 --> 38:50.502
Andre is innocent.

38:50.545 --> 38:52.504
Please tell Eric
the kiss meant nothing.

38:52.547 --> 38:54.549
This is all Sydney's fault.Oh, well...

38:56.421 --> 38:57.944
Hold that thought.

38:57.987 --> 39:00.250
Oh, God. Come on.

39:04.994 --> 39:06.344
Tires.

39:15.135 --> 39:17.224
Aww...

39:17.267 --> 39:19.879
Oh, really?
Come on.

39:21.489 --> 39:23.230
Seriously?

39:23.273 --> 39:25.058
Get up.KENSI: I had him.

39:25.101 --> 39:27.539
I was gonna go two for two
on a horse.

39:27.582 --> 39:28.801
Hey, Sydney.

39:28.844 --> 39:31.804
What's up?So, Andre, these are my people.

39:31.847 --> 39:35.416
Kensi-- she's essentially
a goddess from Themyscira.

39:37.331 --> 39:39.246
Callen-- once a lone wolf,
now he's more of a lion,

39:39.289 --> 39:41.248
and we are his pride.
And Sam--

39:41.291 --> 39:43.250
former Navy SEAL,

39:43.293 --> 39:44.904
decorated NCIS agent.

39:44.947 --> 39:47.341
And the man can really
make moves on the dance floor.

39:47.385 --> 39:50.300
See? Nell likes
the way I dance.

39:51.214 --> 39:52.564
I like your dancing, too.

39:52.607 --> 39:53.782
Why, what's going on?No reason.

39:54.870 --> 39:57.438
You must be Andre Martinez.

39:57.482 --> 39:59.788
We have been looking
all over for you.

39:59.832 --> 40:01.964
Thank you.

40:02.008 --> 40:04.097
All of you.

40:04.140 --> 40:06.012
But, Sydney, Nell...
Oh.

40:06.055 --> 40:08.449
...especially you guys.
Well,

40:08.493 --> 40:11.104
you should really think
about moving to L.A.

40:11.147 --> 40:13.193
We could do this stuff
all the time.

40:13.236 --> 40:14.586
Oh, God.

40:24.726 --> 40:26.598
Hey.

40:26.641 --> 40:28.600
Hey.

40:28.643 --> 40:32.299
So, you definitely
saw the kiss.

40:32.342 --> 40:34.823
Sorry, kiss?

40:34.867 --> 40:37.522
I mean, Callen and Sam
told you, right?

40:40.438 --> 40:42.004
Sure, he was kind of cute,

40:42.048 --> 40:44.616
but believe me,
he tasted like a doughnut.

40:45.921 --> 40:48.794
I swear, it meant nothing.

40:51.013 --> 40:52.101
Promise?

40:52.145 --> 40:55.365
Eric, do I joke about
the doughnuts?

40:59.195 --> 41:00.632
I missed you.

41:00.675 --> 41:01.937
I missed you, too.

41:01.981 --> 41:03.417
Oh, my gosh, I have
so much to tell you.

41:03.461 --> 41:04.592
Tell me everything.
Okay.

41:04.636 --> 41:05.941
Where to begin?

41:05.985 --> 41:07.682
Well, for starters,

41:07.726 --> 41:09.510
Sydney straight-up
kidnapped me.

41:09.554 --> 41:11.294
What? No.

41:11.338 --> 41:12.818
And then she straight-up
killed my phone.

41:12.861 --> 41:14.602
Yeah, it was death
by iced water.

41:14.646 --> 41:17.736
You know, if I did not know,
from a technological standpoint,

41:17.779 --> 41:19.738
that your phone was
obliterated,

41:19.781 --> 41:21.696
I would not believe you.

41:21.740 --> 41:24.090
Oh, God, you know what?

41:24.133 --> 41:25.570
It really pains me to say this,

41:25.613 --> 41:29.443
but it was kind of fun
hanging out with Sydney today.

41:29.487 --> 41:32.533
Oh, no, I think
she might be cool.
Hmm.

41:32.577 --> 41:35.405
Must run in the family.Stop it.

41:35.449 --> 41:37.451
Come here,
come here.

41:42.238 --> 41:43.283
DEEKS:
Rogers!

41:43.326 --> 41:44.371
You made it.
What are you drinking?

41:44.414 --> 41:46.416
Uh, chardonnay.
Oh.

41:46.460 --> 41:47.548
Now the party's
getting started.

41:47.592 --> 41:48.941
ROGERS: Well, I received
your invitation

41:48.984 --> 41:50.638
and thought it would be
rude of me to not show up.

41:50.682 --> 41:53.119
Well, we are glad
that you did,

41:53.162 --> 41:56.252
because we wanted to say
that you are one of us now.

41:56.296 --> 41:58.037
SAM:
And we're sorry

41:58.080 --> 41:59.908
if we ever treated you
any differently, huh?

41:59.952 --> 42:01.693
Apology accepted.

42:01.736 --> 42:05.000
I'm just glad everybody's safe,
the case is closed,

42:05.044 --> 42:06.349
Andre's name is cleared
and that hard drive is

42:06.393 --> 42:07.394
back where it belongs.

42:07.437 --> 42:09.265
What about Commodore Kang?

42:09.309 --> 42:11.877
Oh, that bitch is going down.

42:13.574 --> 42:15.054
To Rogers.

42:15.097 --> 42:16.403
ALL:
To Rogers.

42:16.446 --> 42:17.578
I'll drink to that.

42:17.622 --> 42:20.233
Welcome to the team.

42:20.276 --> 42:22.714
You are too kind. Really.

42:22.757 --> 42:25.064
But, Agent Callen, you know
you can't charm your way

42:25.107 --> 42:26.195
out of your review.

42:29.503 --> 42:30.591
To Rogers.

42:30.635 --> 42:32.767
DEEKS: There we go.
