WEBVTT

00:08.867 --> 00:10.567
- AH.

00:45.633 --> 00:47.433
[spits loudly]

00:55.800 --> 00:57.667
[sighs loudly]

00:57.733 --> 01:00.100
- WHAT?
- NOTHIN'.

01:00.167 --> 01:01.333
- NO, WHAT?

01:01.400 --> 01:03.600
- NOTHIN'. I'M JUST
WAITING FOR THE MIRROR.

01:07.300 --> 01:09.167
- GOT TO PLUCK YOUR EYEBROWS
BEFORE YOU GO TO BED?

01:09.233 --> 01:10.333
WHAT'S WITH THAT?

01:10.400 --> 01:12.333
YOU'RE JUST GONNA
MUSH 'EM UP, ANYWAY.

01:12.400 --> 01:16.200
- WELL, YOU COMB YOUR HAIR.
HOW STUPID IS THAT?

01:16.267 --> 01:17.933
- THAT'S MY ROUTINE.

01:18.000 --> 01:20.467
WASH FACE, COMB HAIR,
BRUSH TEETH...

01:20.533 --> 01:23.567
SCRAPE TONGUE.

01:23.633 --> 01:25.167
YOU NEVER KNOW WHEN
THAT "BLUE MOON"

01:25.233 --> 01:27.567
IS GONNA POP UP.

01:27.633 --> 01:29.767
- WELL, YOU'RE GETTING
IN THE WAY OF MY ROUTINE.

01:29.833 --> 01:31.900
- WELL, IT'S MY BATHROOM, TOO,
YOU KNOW.

01:31.967 --> 01:35.100
- YES, I KNOW.

01:35.167 --> 01:37.067
- I GUESS I SHOULD
JUST MOVE OUT

01:37.133 --> 01:38.733
AND LEAVE THE WHOLE BATHROOM
TO YOU.

01:39.833 --> 01:43.433
- REALLY?

01:43.500 --> 01:44.533
- HUH?

01:44.600 --> 01:47.667
- COULD I HAVE
THE BATHROOM?

01:47.733 --> 01:50.033
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

01:50.100 --> 01:51.867
- OH, FORGET IT.

01:51.933 --> 01:54.600
- WHAT, YOU WANT ME TO
MOVE OUT OF OUR BATHROOM?

01:54.667 --> 01:56.933
- NO...NO.
I GUESS WE CAN JUST...

01:57.000 --> 01:59.733
GO ON LIKE THIS...

02:00.700 --> 02:02.700
[sighs]
FOREVER.

02:02.767 --> 02:06.667
- WAIT, WHAT'S WRONG WITH ME
BEING IN THIS BATHROOM?

02:06.733 --> 02:08.000
WHAT?

02:08.067 --> 02:10.067
EVERY TIME I SPIT ON YOU,
I WIPE YOU OFF.

02:10.133 --> 02:11.067
- I KNOW.

02:11.133 --> 02:14.200
NO, I KNOW THAT,
AND I APPRECIATE IT.

02:14.267 --> 02:16.467
IT'S JUST THAT THERE'S ALWAYS
PUDDLES OF WATER

02:16.533 --> 02:18.033
ON THE FLOOR AFTER YOU SHOWER,

02:18.100 --> 02:20.433
AND YOU LEAVE
YOUR WET TOWEL ON THE TUB.

02:20.500 --> 02:22.267
YOU USE MY ROLL-ON DEODORANT.
YOU TAKE--

02:22.333 --> 02:23.467
- WAIT A MINUTE.
WAIT A MINUTE.

02:23.533 --> 02:25.200
I DON'T USE
YOUR ROLL-ON DEODORANT, OKAY.

02:25.267 --> 02:27.400
THAT GOES AGAINST
EVERYTHING I STAND FOR.

02:28.400 --> 02:31.367
- RAY, I FOUND A HAIR.

02:33.633 --> 02:36.000
- ALL RIGHT, ONE TIME!

02:36.067 --> 02:37.600
ONE! ONE!
ONE LOUSY SWIPE.

02:37.667 --> 02:41.667
THAT HAIR MUST HAVE
BEEN VERY LOOSE.

02:41.733 --> 02:42.667
- OKAY.
IT'S OKAY.

02:42.733 --> 02:43.667
I THREW THE WHOLE THING OUT

02:43.733 --> 02:45.667
BEFORE IT EVER TOUCHED ME.

02:47.433 --> 02:50.600
- DO I DISGUST YOU?
I DISGUST YOU, DON'T I?

02:50.667 --> 02:52.700
- NO, NO, NO.

02:52.767 --> 02:55.233
NOT ALL THE TIME.

02:55.300 --> 02:56.500
IT'S JUST THAT...

02:56.567 --> 02:59.300
YOU KNOW, THERE'S NO ROOM
FOR MY STUFF.

02:59.367 --> 03:00.467
DO YOU KNOW HOW MUCH
I WOULD LOVE

03:00.533 --> 03:02.167
TO HAVE A THING
OF Q-TIPS RIGHT HERE?

03:02.233 --> 03:04.533
OR HAVE MY CURLING IRON
ALWAYS PLUGGED IN?

03:04.600 --> 03:06.667
OR MY MAKE-UP LAID OUT
WHERE I COULD SEE EVERYTHING

03:06.733 --> 03:09.333
INSTEAD OF STUFFED IN A BOX
UNDER THE SINK?

03:09.400 --> 03:11.667
- OKAY.
- I JUST--

03:11.733 --> 03:12.567
- OKAY, LISTEN,

03:12.633 --> 03:14.400
I'LL USE THE BATHROOM
DOWN THE HALL.

03:14.467 --> 03:15.967
- NO, NO, NO.
THAT'S NOT WHY I SAID IT.

03:16.033 --> 03:17.233
I DON'T WANT YOU
TO DO THAT.

03:17.300 --> 03:18.967
- NO, IT'S NOTHING.
IT'S EASY FOR ME.

03:19.033 --> 03:21.333
TOOTHBRUSH, RAZOR, COMB--
WHAT DO I NEED?

03:22.800 --> 03:25.167
- YOU WOULD REALLY DO THAT?

03:25.233 --> 03:26.367
- NOT JUST FOR ANYBODY.

03:26.433 --> 03:30.267
FOR THE WOMAN
I'M HAVING SEX WITH TONIGHT.

03:42.167 --> 03:44.033
[knocking on door]

03:44.100 --> 03:48.367
- MICHAEL, COME ON!
I'M LATE FOR WORK!

03:48.433 --> 03:50.867
AW, YOU DID THIS YESTERDAY!

03:50.933 --> 03:55.067
YOU'VE BEEN ON THE TOILET
FOR HALF AN HOUR!

03:55.133 --> 03:58.333
COME ON,
YOU'RE 7, NOT 67!

04:01.533 --> 04:03.700
WERE YOU PLAYING
WITH YOUR ACTION FIGURES?

04:03.767 --> 04:05.633
- IT HELPS ME.

04:05.700 --> 04:09.267
- ALL RIGHT, COME ON.
GO, GO. GO TO SCHOOL.

04:09.333 --> 04:11.567
AW, NO!

04:11.633 --> 04:15.000
NO, COME ON!
THIS IS NOT GOOD!

04:15.067 --> 04:18.167
PICK UP YOUR CLOTHES!

04:18.233 --> 04:21.667
AT LEAST HANG THE TOWEL
ON THE KNOB, HUH?

04:23.333 --> 04:26.767
TOILET PAPER DOESN'T
BELONG ON THE FLOOR!

04:28.867 --> 04:31.700
IT'S LIKE A BUS STATION
IN HERE.

04:56.667 --> 04:58.500
- DADDY, I HAVE TO GO
TO THE BATHROOM.

04:58.567 --> 05:00.833
- YEAH, ALL RIGHT.
GO AHEAD.

05:00.900 --> 05:02.267
- DADDY!

05:02.333 --> 05:03.500
- WHAT?

05:08.067 --> 05:10.000
ALL RIGHT.

05:10.067 --> 05:12.300
I'M LEAVING.

05:12.367 --> 05:16.100
HERE.
KNOCK YOURSELF OUT.

05:33.833 --> 05:36.967
WHAT THE HELL?

05:37.033 --> 05:39.167
- I LIT
THE CANDLES FOR YOU.

05:39.233 --> 05:41.500
- OH, I CAN'T WAIT!

05:43.933 --> 05:45.733
OH, MY.

05:45.800 --> 05:48.400
IT'S BEAUTIFUL!

05:48.467 --> 05:49.267
- OH, HI.

05:49.333 --> 05:51.033
- OH, HELLO, RAYMOND.
- HEY.

05:51.100 --> 05:53.300
- I JUST BROUGHT YOUR MOTHER UP
TO SHOW OFF.

05:53.367 --> 05:54.967
- WHEN DID YOU DO THIS?

05:55.033 --> 05:55.967
- YESTERDAY.

05:56.033 --> 05:57.467
OH, AND I TOOK YOUR SUGGESTION,
MARIE.

05:57.533 --> 06:00.500
I PUT THE LIGHTS
ON A DIMMER.

06:00.567 --> 06:01.367
HUH?

06:01.433 --> 06:04.500
- OH, THAT'S NICE.

06:04.567 --> 06:05.933
I ALWAYS DIM THEM,

06:06.000 --> 06:08.567
AND THEN I LIGHT
A GARDENIA CANDLE.

06:08.633 --> 06:10.400
THEN I'M READY
TO DROP MY ROBE

06:10.467 --> 06:13.500
AND SLIDE INTO
MY BUBBLE BATH.

06:14.733 --> 06:17.333
- I'M GONNA SIT.

06:17.400 --> 06:21.800
- OH, OH, AND LOOK AT THIS.

06:21.867 --> 06:22.600
WATER MASSAGE.

06:22.667 --> 06:24.600
- OH, YOU GOT ONE OF THOSE!
- YES.

06:24.667 --> 06:26.233
- OH, YOU TWO ARE
GOING TO BE SO HAPPY

06:26.300 --> 06:29.067
THAT YOU'VE DONE ALL THIS.

06:29.133 --> 06:31.867
YOU KNOW,
WHEN ROBBIE MOVED OUT,

06:31.933 --> 06:33.800
I TOOK OVER THE BOYS' BATHROOM,

06:33.867 --> 06:38.233
AND NOW FRANK AND I
GET ALONG SO MUCH BETTER.

06:38.300 --> 06:39.933
- YEAH, DEBRA AND I
HAVE ALWAYS DREAMED OF

06:40.000 --> 06:42.133
HAVING A MARRIAGE
LIKE YOURS.

06:43.600 --> 06:45.467
- OH, I BETTER GO;
I'M EXPECTING A DELIVERY,

06:45.533 --> 06:48.067
AND YOUR FATHER
DOESN'T HAVE PANTS ON.

06:48.133 --> 06:50.267
YOU DID A MARVELOUS JOB,
DEBRA.

06:50.333 --> 06:54.000
I JUST MAY HAVE TO
BATHE HERE MYSELF SOMETIME.

06:55.800 --> 06:58.733
- LOT OF NICE IMAGES TODAY.

07:03.933 --> 07:06.033
- SO, WHAT DO YOU THINK?

07:06.100 --> 07:07.400
- OH, IT'S INCREDIBLE.
- UH-HUH.

07:07.467 --> 07:09.100
WHAT DO YOU GOT COMING
OUT OF THE TAP NOW,

07:09.167 --> 07:11.467
HOLY WATER?

07:14.367 --> 07:16.967
- SO HOW'S ALL THIS
WORKING OUT FOR YOU?

07:17.033 --> 07:19.300
- OH, TERRIFIC.
YEAH.

07:19.367 --> 07:20.500
YEAH, I JUST, YOU KNOW,

07:20.567 --> 07:22.600
IT WAS KIND OF CROWDED
IN THE KIDS' BATHROOM.

07:22.667 --> 07:26.333
I THOUGHT I'D COME BACK
AND VISIT THE OLD NEIGHBORHOOD.

07:26.400 --> 07:28.800
- SO YOU WANT TO USE THIS?

07:28.867 --> 07:30.367
OKAY.
GO AHEAD.

07:30.433 --> 07:31.467
- YEAH, REALLY?
OKAY.

07:31.533 --> 07:33.667
- SURE.
- ALL RIGHT, THANKS.

07:42.567 --> 07:44.200
SORRY.

07:47.900 --> 07:50.567
HOW 'BOUT I JUST, UH...

07:54.600 --> 07:57.367
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I DON'T NEED A BATHROOM.

08:12.967 --> 08:14.900
- HEY.

08:14.967 --> 08:18.133
WELL, WELL, LOOK AT THIS.

08:18.200 --> 08:19.967
WHAT DO WE HAVE HERE, DAD?

08:20.033 --> 08:21.367
- WELL, ROBERT,
DID YOU HEAR?

08:21.433 --> 08:24.133
DEBRA KICKED HIM
OUT OF HIS BATHROOM.

08:24.200 --> 08:25.567
- SHE DIDN'T KICK ME OUT.

08:25.633 --> 08:26.700
I GAVE IT TO HER.

08:26.767 --> 08:28.400
- YOU GAVE IT TO HER?

08:28.467 --> 08:29.333
- WHY?

08:29.400 --> 08:31.400
- BECAUSE I SPIT, SHE SIGHED,

08:31.467 --> 08:33.700
I FELT BAD, AND HERE I AM.

08:35.367 --> 08:37.467
- YOU JUST GAVE UP THE BATHROOM?

08:37.533 --> 08:40.600
THAT'S THE MOST IMPORTANT
ROOM OF THE HOUSE.

08:40.667 --> 08:45.267
IT'S THE ONLY PLACE A MAN
CAN TRULY EXPRESS HIMSELF.

08:45.333 --> 08:50.067
- OH, I'M FAMILIAR WITH
SOME OF YOUR EXPRESSIONS, DAD.

08:50.133 --> 08:53.833
- I'M NOT KIDDING AROUND,
MARY ALICE.

08:53.900 --> 08:56.467
LET THE WOMAN HAVE
THE KITCHEN AND THE BEDROOM.

08:56.533 --> 09:00.467
THE BATHROOM
BELONGS TO THE KING.

09:00.533 --> 09:05.500
- YES, AND IT APPEARS RAYMOND
HAS ABDICATED HIS THRONE.

09:07.400 --> 09:09.600
- IT'S NO BIG DEAL,
ALL RIGHT?

09:09.667 --> 09:12.767
THIS IS A COMPROMISE YOU MAKE
WHEN YOU LIVE WITH A PERSON.

09:12.833 --> 09:13.967
- COMPROMISE.

09:14.033 --> 09:19.100
THAT'S WHAT THE LOSER SAYS
TO EXPLAIN WHAT HAPPENED.

09:19.167 --> 09:21.167
- LOOK, THERE'S NOTHING WRONG
WITH DEBRA

09:21.233 --> 09:24.400
HAVING A PLACE IN THE HOUSE
THAT'S HERS.

09:27.633 --> 09:30.500
- OH, YEAH?
WHERE'S YOUR PLACE, RAY?

09:30.567 --> 09:32.600
- I GOT MY OFFICE.

09:32.667 --> 09:35.333
- YOU MEAN YOUR LITTLE
WOODEN DESK DOWN IN THE BASEMENT

09:35.400 --> 09:37.767
NEXT TO THE HOT-WATER HEATER?

09:37.833 --> 09:41.367
- LOOK, WHAT YOU TWO GENIUSES
DON'T UNDERSTAND

09:41.433 --> 09:42.867
IS THAT EVER SINCE
I DID THIS,

09:42.933 --> 09:45.133
THE WIFE HAS BEEN
IN A GREAT MOOD.

09:45.200 --> 09:48.067
AS A MATTER OF FACT,
LAST NIGHT, WE...

09:48.133 --> 09:51.533
UH-HUH...

09:51.600 --> 09:53.733
AND NO BEGGING.

09:58.867 --> 10:02.067
- AND HOW LONG DO YOU THINK
THAT'S GONNA LAST?

10:02.133 --> 10:04.633
- LOOK, ALL I KNOW IS WHEN
I SAID I'D GET OUT OF THERE,

10:04.700 --> 10:07.633
SHE'S BEEN ALL HAPPY,
AND THAT'S GOOD ENOUGH FOR ME.

10:07.700 --> 10:09.200
- WHY DON'T YOU
MOVE OUT COMPLETELY?

10:09.267 --> 10:11.367
YOU'LL GET ACTION
ALL THE TIME.

10:15.267 --> 10:17.200
- I'LL TELL YOU
WHY SHE'S HAPPY.

10:17.267 --> 10:19.933
SHE'S THE KING NOW.

10:20.000 --> 10:21.133
AND WHO ARE YOU?

10:21.200 --> 10:24.100
LOOK AT YOURSELF
IN THE TOASTER!

10:27.400 --> 10:29.233
YOU'RE THE COURT JESTER,

10:29.300 --> 10:32.100
SHAVING IN THE KITCHEN SINK.

10:32.167 --> 10:33.500
YOU LISTEN TO ME, YOU DOPE.

10:33.567 --> 10:35.167
YOU TAKE BACK THIS HOUSE,
OR PRETTY SOON,

10:35.233 --> 10:39.400
YOU'LL BE OUTSIDE PITCHING
A TENT OVER THE SANDBOX!

10:40.900 --> 10:42.900
- I DON'T NEED TO
TAKE BACK THIS HOUSE.

10:42.967 --> 10:44.167
IT'S MY HOUSE, ALL RIGHT?

10:44.233 --> 10:45.300
IT'S ALWAYS BEEN MY HOUSE,

10:45.367 --> 10:48.067
ND IT'LL ALWAYS BE MY HOUSE,
ALL RIGHT?

10:48.133 --> 10:50.467
SO JUST MIND YOUR BUSINESSES,
BOTH OF YOU.

10:54.333 --> 10:56.467
- YOU KNOW WHAT?
YOU'RE RIGHT, RAYMOND.

10:56.533 --> 10:58.933
I FEEL BAD ABOUT
WHAT I SAID.

10:59.000 --> 11:01.267
YOU DESERVE TO RELAX.

11:01.333 --> 11:03.167
LET ME RUN YOU
A HOT BATH.

11:16.100 --> 11:20.433
[water heater rumbles]

11:20.500 --> 11:22.667
[rumbling stops]

11:22.733 --> 11:26.000
- WELL, I KNOW, BUT YOU
SHOULDN'T BE GOING TO BARS.

11:26.067 --> 11:29.000
YOU ARE NEVER GONNA
MEET GUYS THAT WAY, AMY.

11:29.067 --> 11:30.300
HOLD ON ONE SECOND.

11:30.367 --> 11:33.100
RAY, HAVE YOU SEEN
LAST MONTH'S BANK STATEMENT?

11:33.167 --> 11:34.533
ARE YOU SURE?

11:37.033 --> 11:39.567
WHERE DID I
PUT THAT THING?

11:39.633 --> 11:41.733
WHY WOULD YOU
GO TO A SPORTS BAR?

11:41.800 --> 11:45.600
COME ON, I MEAN AREN'T ALL THOSE
GUYS IN THE WORST SHAPE?

11:47.733 --> 11:50.233
- [sighs]

11:50.300 --> 11:53.200
- I'M SURE I PUT IT
ON THIS DESK SOMEWHERE.

11:55.100 --> 11:57.167
- OH.

11:57.233 --> 12:00.267
- AH! THERE WE GO.
I FOUND IT.

12:00.333 --> 12:04.200
- [sighs]
OH...

12:04.267 --> 12:06.433
- WOW! I THINK OUR BANK
IS RIPPING US OFF.

12:06.500 --> 12:09.467
THESE ATM FEES
ARE UNBELIEVABLE.

12:09.533 --> 12:11.733
- [loud sigh]

12:11.800 --> 12:14.867
- BUT ANYWAY, YOU KNOW WHAT
WOULD BE GOOD FOR YOU?

12:14.933 --> 12:17.933
ON-LINE DATING SERVICES.
UH-HUH.

12:18.000 --> 12:19.500
- ALL RIGHT, THAT'S IT.
GET OUT!

12:19.567 --> 12:20.700
- WHAT?

12:20.767 --> 12:21.833
- "OH, AMY,

12:21.900 --> 12:23.800
BOK-BOK-BOK-BOK-
BOK-BOK-BOK-BOK."

12:23.867 --> 12:26.000
GET OUT.

12:33.733 --> 12:35.567
- AMY...

12:35.633 --> 12:39.333
CAN I CALL YOU BACK?

12:39.400 --> 12:42.967
OKAY.

12:43.033 --> 12:46.067
IS THERE SOMETHING WRONG?

12:46.133 --> 12:47.633
- YOU'VE GOT EVERY ROOM
IN THE HOUSE.

12:47.700 --> 12:49.733
YOU GOT THE KITCHEN,
YOU GOT THE BEDROOM.

12:49.800 --> 12:51.133
THE LIVING ROOM ISN'T MINE.

12:51.200 --> 12:52.667
I EVEN HANDED OVER
THE BATHROOM,

12:52.733 --> 12:55.067
MY THRONE, MY VERY THRONE.

12:55.133 --> 12:56.400
I WOULD THINK
THE LEAST YOU COULD DO

12:56.467 --> 12:58.133
IS LET ME HAVE
MY LITTLE DUNGEON DOWN HERE,

12:58.200 --> 13:00.367
WHERE, BY THE WAY,
I HAPPEN TO MAKE ALL THE MONEY

13:00.433 --> 13:02.333
THAT PAYS FOR THIS
WHOLE CASTLE.

13:02.400 --> 13:05.133
OR IS THAT
TOO MUCH TO ASK?

13:06.500 --> 13:09.067
- NO.

13:13.667 --> 13:15.633
[stomping up stairs]

13:15.700 --> 13:18.033
- THAT'S RIGHT.

13:18.100 --> 13:20.400
AAH!

13:34.400 --> 13:35.800
- WHAT ARE YOU DOIN'?

13:35.867 --> 13:37.367
- WHAT AM I DOING?

13:37.433 --> 13:40.533
I'M GIVING THE BATHROOM KING
HIS THRONE BACK.

13:43.033 --> 13:45.200
- LOOK, I WAS JUST
TRYING TO MAKE A POINT.

13:45.267 --> 13:47.500
I WANT A LITTLE SPACE
TO MYSELF DOWNSTAIRS.

13:47.567 --> 13:49.933
- THEN WHY DIDN'T YOU SAY THAT
INSTEAD OF GIVING A BIG SPEECH

13:50.000 --> 13:51.500
ABOUT HOW YOU HAVE NOTHING?

13:51.567 --> 13:52.300
- I DID.

13:52.367 --> 13:54.433
- WHEN DID YOU SAY,
"EXCUSE ME,

13:54.500 --> 13:57.433
I JUST NEED SOME SPACE
RIGHT NOW IN MY OFFICE"?

13:57.500 --> 13:59.633
- WHEN I SIGHED.

14:04.100 --> 14:05.833
- YOU SIGHED?

14:05.900 --> 14:07.800
- YEAH, I WENT...
[sighs].

14:07.867 --> 14:10.867
- WHAT? I'M SUPPOSED
TO KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS?

14:10.933 --> 14:12.833
- YES, BECAUSE WHEN YOU WENT...
[sighs]

14:12.900 --> 14:16.433
I GAVE YOU THE BATHROOM.

14:16.500 --> 14:18.067
- I NEVER WENT...
[sigh]

14:18.133 --> 14:19.233
- OH, COME ON.

14:19.300 --> 14:21.433
YOU PRACTICALLY FOGGED UP
THE MIRROR WITH YOUR...

14:21.500 --> 14:22.333
[loud sigh]

14:22.400 --> 14:23.767
MEANTIME, YOU DIDN'T
GET THE MESSAGE,

14:23.833 --> 14:27.733
EVEN THOUGH I HAD TO GO...
[repetitive sighing]

14:27.800 --> 14:28.700
- OKAY, FINE--

14:28.767 --> 14:33.633
- GIVE ME A SECOND.
I'M A LITTLE DIZZY.

14:33.700 --> 14:34.500
- IF--IF I DID SIGH,

14:34.567 --> 14:36.167
I DIDN'T MEAN
ANYTHING BY IT.

14:36.233 --> 14:37.833
- OH, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.

14:37.900 --> 14:40.533
I KNOW YOU TOO WELL.
I KNOW EXACTLY WHAT IT MEANT.

14:40.600 --> 14:43.600
IT MEANT
"YOU SMELL. GET OUT."

14:43.667 --> 14:47.400
- RAY, YOU MAY SMELL,
BUT YOU OFFERED TO LEAVE!

14:47.467 --> 14:48.667
- WELL, I DIDN'T MEAN IT.

14:48.733 --> 14:50.033
- WELL, WHY DID YOU SAY IT?

14:50.100 --> 14:52.533
- I WAS BEING NICE!

14:52.600 --> 14:54.433
- WELL, THIS SHOULD BE
A LITTLE LESSON FOR YOU.

14:54.500 --> 14:56.467
YOU SHOULD ALWAYS MEAN
WHAT YOU SAY.

14:56.533 --> 14:59.367
- AND YOU SHOULD ALWAYS
MEAN WHAT YOU SIGH.

15:02.567 --> 15:05.400
- DO YOU WANT TO KNOW
WHY I SIGH?

15:05.467 --> 15:08.567
IT'S LIKE A PRESSURE VALVE,
A RELEASE.

15:08.633 --> 15:11.400
LIVING WITH YOU, IF I DIDN'T
SIGH EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE,

15:11.467 --> 15:13.167
I WOULD EXPLODE.

15:14.600 --> 15:16.800
- OH, WELL, YOU THINK YOU'RE
SO EASY TO LIVE WITH?

15:16.867 --> 15:17.600
- YES, AS A MATTER OF FACT,

15:17.667 --> 15:22.033
I THINK I'M VERY EASY
TO LIVE WITH.

15:22.100 --> 15:24.100
- HA!

15:24.167 --> 15:26.267
YOU ARE SO WRONG.

15:26.333 --> 15:29.300
OPEN UP THE WINDOW
AND LET SOME OF THE WRONG OUT.

15:31.567 --> 15:34.467
YOU--YOU HAVE
SO MANY ANNOYING HABITS.

15:34.533 --> 15:37.067
- OH, YEAH?
LIKE WHAT?

15:37.133 --> 15:38.267
- OKAY, UH...

15:38.333 --> 15:40.267
YOU KNOW HOW WHEN YOU READ
YOUR MAGAZINE IN BED

15:40.333 --> 15:43.700
AND YOU LICK YOUR FINGERS
BEFORE YOU TURN EVERY PAGE?

15:43.767 --> 15:44.700
- SO?

15:44.767 --> 15:46.100
- I HATE THAT.

15:46.167 --> 15:47.400
- GET OUT OF HERE!

15:47.467 --> 15:49.800
- YES, YES,
'CAUSE YOU SLURP YOUR FINGER.

15:49.867 --> 15:51.267
- SLURP?

15:51.333 --> 15:53.033
THIS IS NOT A SLURP.

15:53.100 --> 15:54.200
- OH, IT'S A SLURP, OKAY?

15:54.267 --> 15:55.333
IT'S RIGHT NEXT TO MY EAR.

15:55.400 --> 15:57.833
[loud slurping noise]

15:57.900 --> 16:00.967
THEN YOU TAKE YOUR WET THUMB,
AND YOU PUT IT ON THE PAGE,

16:01.033 --> 16:02.700
WHICH, BY THE WAY,
IS DISGUSTING.

16:02.767 --> 16:04.867
- OH, OH, I'M SORRY
I'M DISGUSTING YOU

16:04.933 --> 16:06.800
WHILE YOU'RE TRYING
TO CLEAN YOUR TOENAILS

16:06.867 --> 16:08.400
WITH A HANGER.

16:13.900 --> 16:17.167
- THE ONLY REASON I DID THAT
WAS TO SEE IF IT WORKED, OKAY?

16:17.233 --> 16:18.933
AND IT DOES...

16:19.000 --> 16:21.000
FOR THE BIG TOE.

16:21.067 --> 16:22.533
- OKAY, FINE.

16:22.600 --> 16:24.133
AND I LICK MY FINGER
WHEN I READ A MAGAZINE.

16:24.200 --> 16:26.533
IF THAT'S ALL YOU'VE GOT,
YOU'VE GOT IT PRETTY GOOD.

16:26.600 --> 16:28.000
- OH, I'VE GOT PLENTY MORE,
SISTER.

16:28.067 --> 16:29.933
I GOT PLENTY MORE, ALL RIGHT?

16:30.000 --> 16:31.967
HOW 'BOUT THE WAY YOU SNEEZE?

16:32.033 --> 16:33.933
- WHAT IS WRONG
WITH THE WAY I SNEEZE?

16:34.000 --> 16:37.000
- BECAUSE YOU DON'T SNEEZE.
YOU TRY TO STOP IT.

16:37.067 --> 16:38.400
AH, AH, AH!

16:38.467 --> 16:40.033
NYEAH!

16:40.100 --> 16:41.633
AH, NYEAH!

16:41.700 --> 16:43.667
AH, NYEAH!

16:43.733 --> 16:45.267
DO YOU KNOW
HOW ANNOYING THAT IS?

16:45.333 --> 16:48.433
NOT TO MENTION, YOU COULD
BLOW OUT YOUR EYE THAT WAY.

16:48.500 --> 16:51.400
- OH? AND HOW WOULD YOU
LIKE ME TO SNEEZE?

16:51.467 --> 16:53.800
- LIKE A PERSON.
JUST LET IT GO.

16:53.867 --> 16:56.067
A PERSON GOES,
AH-CHOO!

16:56.133 --> 16:58.400
NOT, AH-NYEAH!

17:02.633 --> 17:04.233
- OH, SO I SHOULD JUST
LET IT GO

17:04.300 --> 17:06.000
AND SPRAY EVERYTHING,
LIKE YOU.

17:06.067 --> 17:09.367
YOU SNEEZE LIKE IT'S
A BIG BROADWAY MUSICAL FINALE.

17:09.433 --> 17:11.100
AH...CHOO!

17:11.167 --> 17:12.833
AH...CHOO!

17:12.900 --> 17:15.967
AH...CHOO!

17:16.033 --> 17:19.633
GOOD NIGHT, EVERYBODY!
ENJOY MY MUCUS!

17:24.233 --> 17:27.000
- I KNOW WHY YOU TRY
TO STOP YOUR SNEEZE.

17:27.067 --> 17:28.800
'CAUSE YOU WANT TO CONTROL IT.

17:28.867 --> 17:31.200
YES, IT'S ALL ABOUT CONTROL.

17:31.267 --> 17:33.167
THAT'S RIGHT.

17:33.233 --> 17:36.167
YOU GOT TO CONTROL
EVERYTHING,

17:36.233 --> 17:39.400
ESPECIALLY IN HERE.

17:41.533 --> 17:44.100
- UP YOUR NOSE?

17:44.167 --> 17:46.733
- AND INTO MY BRAIN.

17:46.800 --> 17:51.767
- WELL, I GUESS I WOULD USE
THE BIGGEST OPENING.

17:51.833 --> 17:53.567
- HA HA HA HA!

17:53.633 --> 17:55.233
AH, NYEAH!

18:00.600 --> 18:02.300
HOW 'BOUT--
HOW 'BOUT THE TIME

18:02.367 --> 18:04.000
THAT WE WERE AT THE PET STORE
WITH THE KIDS

18:04.067 --> 18:05.533
AND THAT GUY HAD A MONKEY?

18:05.600 --> 18:08.500
ALL I DID WAS LOOK AT IT,
AND YOU GAVE ME THAT FACE.

18:08.567 --> 18:09.400
- WHAT FACE?

18:09.467 --> 18:11.800
THAT "DON'T EVEN
THINK ABOUT IT" FACE.

18:11.867 --> 18:15.133
- WELL, YOU KNOW WE CAN'T HAVE
A MONKEY IN THE HOUSE!

18:15.200 --> 18:16.600
- I KNOW!

18:16.667 --> 18:19.800
I WASN'T GOING
TO BUY A MONKEY.

18:19.867 --> 18:23.067
BUT YOU DIDN'T EVEN LIKE
THAT I THOUGHT IT MIGHT BE FUN.

18:23.133 --> 18:25.333
- THAT'S RIGHT, BECAUSE MAYBE
I DON'T WANT TO THINK

18:25.400 --> 18:27.400
THAT MY HUSBAND,
WHO I'M MARRIED TO,

18:27.467 --> 18:32.000
WOULD LIKE TO LIVE
WITH A MONKEY!

18:32.067 --> 18:33.600
- WELL, MAYBE I WOULD.

18:33.667 --> 18:36.700
- WELL, MAYBE I DO.

18:42.400 --> 18:43.967
- ALL RIGHT.
YOU KNOW WHAT, GET OUT.

18:44.033 --> 18:45.333
GET OUT OF MY BATHROOM!

18:45.400 --> 18:48.500
- NO, YOU GAVE IT TO ME,
AND I'M KEEPING IT.

18:48.567 --> 18:51.000
- WHAT, NO,
YOU SAID I COULD COME BACK.

18:51.067 --> 18:52.167
- YEAH, WELL, I CHANGED MY MIND.

18:52.233 --> 18:53.267
I'M TAKING THE BATHROOM.

18:53.333 --> 18:55.033
YOU CAN JUST GO OUT
AND THINK ABOUT MONKEYS.

18:55.100 --> 18:56.267
NOW GET OUT!

18:56.333 --> 18:57.867
- I'M NOT GOIN' ANYWHERE!

18:57.933 --> 19:00.133
YOU--

19:03.667 --> 19:06.667
GET OUT!

19:08.133 --> 19:09.567
- WATCH YOURSELF.

19:12.000 --> 19:14.467
[turns on water]

19:15.767 --> 19:16.867
[water stops running]

19:16.933 --> 19:18.500
- HA HA! DOESN'T EVEN WORK.

19:18.567 --> 19:20.567
AH! HEY!

19:24.067 --> 19:25.433
- I WARNED YOU!

19:25.500 --> 19:27.267
I WARNED YOU,
NOW GET OUT!

19:27.333 --> 19:28.700
- I AM NOT GETTING--

19:28.767 --> 19:29.700
WHAT, ARE YOU CRAZY?

19:29.767 --> 19:31.467
ARE YOU CRAZY?

19:31.533 --> 19:32.967
TAKE IT, THEN!

19:33.033 --> 19:33.967
- YOU GIVE IT BACK!

19:34.033 --> 19:35.000
THIS IS MY SHOWER MASSAGE!

19:35.067 --> 19:37.167
- YOUR SHOWER,
YEAH, YEAH, OKAY.

19:37.233 --> 19:39.133
HAVE YOUR SHOWER!

19:39.200 --> 19:40.733
- DROP IT! DROP IT!

19:40.800 --> 19:41.900
- YOU DROP IT FIRST!

19:41.967 --> 19:43.300
- LET'S DROP IT
AT THE SAME TIME!

19:43.367 --> 19:44.767
- ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT,
ALL RIGHT!

19:44.833 --> 19:45.833
- ON THE COUNT OF THREE!

19:45.900 --> 19:48.533
ONE...TWO...

19:48.600 --> 19:50.600
THREE!

20:00.433 --> 20:02.100
- YES, THAT'S RIGHT!
THAT'S RIGHT!

20:02.167 --> 20:03.900
- HOW DARE YOU!

20:03.967 --> 20:05.633
GET OUT OF MY BATHROOM!

20:05.700 --> 20:06.967
YOU ARE IN FOR IT, MISTER!

20:07.033 --> 20:08.167
- MY SHOWER!

20:08.233 --> 20:09.633
- YOU ARE IN BIG TROUBLE!
- IT'S MY SHOWER!

20:09.700 --> 20:13.067
IT'S MINE!
IT'S MINE!

20:18.700 --> 20:20.400
- HI, KIDS.

20:20.467 --> 20:22.533
[clears throat]

20:22.600 --> 20:24.600
MOM AND DAD WERE JUST
HAVING A DISCUSSION

20:24.667 --> 20:29.700
ABOUT HOW SOMETIMES
WE NEED OUR OWN SPACE.

20:29.767 --> 20:32.033
- YES.

20:32.100 --> 20:36.633
YEAH, THAT'S ALL.
WE WERE JUST, UH...

20:36.700 --> 20:37.667
HEY, YOU KNOW WHAT?

20:37.733 --> 20:40.667
[screaming]

20:51.033 --> 20:53.400
I LIKE THIS THING.

20:53.467 --> 20:55.000
- YEAH, I GOT IT ON SALE.

20:55.067 --> 20:56.100
- OH, YEAH?
- YEAH.

20:56.167 --> 20:57.667
- I LIKE IT.
I LIKE THE WATER PRESSURE.

20:57.733 --> 20:58.667
- YEAH, IT'S GOOD.

20:58.733 --> 20:59.667
NOT IN THE FACE, BUT...

20:59.733 --> 21:02.367
- YEAH.
NO.

21:09.900 --> 21:11.033
HEY, UH, KIDS!

21:11.100 --> 21:14.133
COME ON BACK.

21:14.200 --> 21:17.300
- WE PROMISE DADDY
WON'T SPRAY YOU AGAIN.
