00:15.133 --> 00:16.533
Hello.

00:16.600 --> 00:18.100
Today on
"Sesame Street,"

00:18.166 --> 00:19.300
we are going to do

00:19.367 --> 00:21.133
a lot of counting.

00:21.200 --> 00:23.166
Both heads: Count heads.

00:23.233 --> 00:24.900
Count heads?
Oh, OK. Why not?

00:24.967 --> 00:26.100
Um, one head,
two heads--

00:26.166 --> 00:27.467
two heads altogether.

00:27.533 --> 00:29.533
Both heads:
No. That wrong.

00:29.600 --> 00:30.700
How can that be wrong?

00:30.767 --> 00:32.033
You're the two-headed monster.

00:32.100 --> 00:33.033
Left head: No, no, no.

00:33.100 --> 00:34.734
One head...

00:34.800 --> 00:36.000
Right head: Two heads...

00:36.066 --> 00:37.767
- Whoop.
- Left head: Three heads...

00:37.834 --> 00:38.900
Oh.

00:38.967 --> 00:40.667
Both heads:
Altogether.

00:40.734 --> 00:42.100
I stand corrected.

00:42.166 --> 00:43.367
Watch out

01:18.934 --> 01:21.300
Three fluttering butterflies.

01:21.367 --> 01:23.934
- Both: Ah ah ah!

01:24.000 --> 01:27.200
- Ha ha ha! Oh, hi there.
- Greetings.

01:27.266 --> 01:29.567
- Welcome to Sesame Street.
- Yes.

01:29.633 --> 01:33.200
Oh, Elmo is counting
with the Count all day.

01:33.266 --> 01:34.934
- Mm-hmm.
- Ha ha ha!

01:35.000 --> 01:36.600
Oh, the Count
is the best counter

01:36.667 --> 01:37.633
on Sesame Street.

01:37.700 --> 01:40.266
Oh, thank you, Elmo.

01:40.333 --> 01:41.934
You know,
they call me the Count

01:42.000 --> 01:43.533
because I love
to count things.

01:43.600 --> 01:44.600
That's right.

01:44.667 --> 01:45.834
- Ooh, Elmo, let's go.

01:45.900 --> 01:47.800
We've got
some counting to do.

01:47.867 --> 01:49.967
- Ha! Ha ha ha!
- Over there.

01:50.033 --> 01:52.066
♪ Ooh doo doo
doo dee dee ♪

01:52.133 --> 01:54.967
Oh, please,
Chris, hurry.

01:55.033 --> 01:57.834
I'm going as fast
as I can, Mrs. Moody.

01:57.900 --> 01:59.266
Elmo: Oh, hi, Chris.

01:59.333 --> 02:01.333
Oh, oh, Elmo?
Oh, hey, Count.

02:01.400 --> 02:02.600
Greetings, Chris.

02:02.667 --> 02:03.767
Oh, hey, I'm so happy
you're here.

02:03.834 --> 02:04.800
I need your help.

02:04.867 --> 02:06.967
Can you help me count
these sandwiches

02:07.033 --> 02:08.767
to make sure I have enough?

02:08.834 --> 02:11.533
I need ten sandwiches
altogether.

02:11.600 --> 02:12.967
Well, of course.

02:13.033 --> 02:14.967
Elmo and I
will count them.

02:15.033 --> 02:16.367
- Elmo: Yeah.
- Count: That's one.

02:16.433 --> 02:18.400
Count:
One sumptuous sandwich.

02:18.467 --> 02:21.367
Two. Two delectable sandwiches.

02:21.433 --> 02:23.734
Three yummy sandwiches--

02:23.800 --> 02:26.100
Please, count faster.

02:26.166 --> 02:28.333
Oh, where was I?
Ah. Ah, yes.

02:28.400 --> 02:32.066
Three, four, five,

02:32.133 --> 02:35.266
six, seven, eight, nine--

02:35.333 --> 02:37.767
Nine sandwiches altogether.

02:37.834 --> 02:40.100
Ah ah ah!

02:40.166 --> 02:42.533
- Yes.

02:42.600 --> 02:45.767
But I need
ten sandwiches.

02:45.834 --> 02:49.100
Uh, nine sandwiches?
Are you sure, Count?

02:49.166 --> 02:50.467
But of course
I am sure, Chris.

02:50.533 --> 02:51.800
I am the Count.

02:51.867 --> 02:53.600
- Uh, the Count...

02:53.667 --> 02:57.934
Elmo thinks the Count
made a little mistake.

03:01.100 --> 03:04.166
Elmo:
There's one, two, three, four,

03:04.233 --> 03:07.467
five, six, seven, eight,

03:07.533 --> 03:10.533
nine, ten sandwiches altogether!

03:10.600 --> 03:12.934
Ah ah ah!
Ha ha ha!

03:13.000 --> 03:15.467
Ohh... Oh,
that is a relief.

03:15.533 --> 03:18.867
Oh. Ohh...

03:18.934 --> 03:20.667
I cannot believe it.

03:20.734 --> 03:24.133
I, the Count,
made a counting mistake?

03:24.200 --> 03:26.333
Well, just a little one.

03:26.400 --> 03:28.800
Oh, the Count
said three twice...

03:28.867 --> 03:30.533
I did?

03:30.600 --> 03:32.633
But it's OK.
Everybody makes mistakes.

03:32.700 --> 03:36.367
One time, I said "meow"
instead of "moo."

03:36.433 --> 03:37.767
Ha ha ha!

03:37.834 --> 03:42.233
OK. Here we go
with your order,
Mrs. Moody.

03:42.300 --> 03:44.333
Oh, thank you, Chris.

03:44.400 --> 03:46.834
You're welcome.
All right. See you.

03:46.900 --> 03:48.734
Oh, oh, what should
Elmo and the Count

03:51.400 --> 03:53.200
- Nothing.

03:53.266 --> 03:56.600
Nada. Zero. Zilch.

03:56.667 --> 03:58.967
Um, but Elmo
and the count are,

03:59.033 --> 04:00.400
you know,
supposed to count

04:00.467 --> 04:02.333
all day together,
remember?

04:02.400 --> 04:04.233
Oh, I am really sorry,

04:04.300 --> 04:07.200
Elmo, but I, the Count,

04:07.266 --> 04:10.500
have made
a counting mistake.

04:10.567 --> 04:13.400
I must make sure that
that never happens again,

04:13.467 --> 04:18.734
so, I shall
never count again.

04:18.800 --> 04:20.500
But--
- Good day.

04:20.567 --> 04:22.900
But the Count--
the Count-- oh, no.

04:22.967 --> 04:28.767
The count is never
counting again... ever?

04:28.834 --> 04:31.000
I can't believe this, Elmo.

04:31.066 --> 04:33.333
We cannot
let him give up.

04:33.400 --> 04:34.734
Let's see
if we can get him

04:34.800 --> 04:37.000
- Oh, ho ho ho!

04:37.066 --> 04:38.467
- Come on. Come on.
- Yeah. Good idea.

04:40.333 --> 04:42.367
Oh, ho ho ho!
The Count.

04:42.433 --> 04:43.834
Nope. I am
no longer the Count.

04:43.900 --> 04:44.834
Huh?

04:44.900 --> 04:48.433
- I am the construction worker.
- But--

04:48.500 --> 04:50.500
Chris and Elmo:
The construction worker?

04:50.567 --> 04:53.133
Yes. They call me
the construction worker

04:53.200 --> 04:56.233
because I love
to build buildings, right?

04:56.300 --> 04:59.266
Right. All right,
construction worker.

04:59.333 --> 05:01.567
All right. We're gonna
have to hammer five nails

05:01.633 --> 05:03.433
- into this here beam...
- All right.

05:03.500 --> 05:04.467
All right, so, uh,

05:04.533 --> 05:06.700
count out five nails,
will you?

05:06.767 --> 05:08.934
Ah, gladly. Ha ha!

05:09.000 --> 05:12.533
That's one. One pointy nail.

05:12.600 --> 05:15.667
Two. Two pointy nai--

05:15.734 --> 05:19.133
Oh, no. No, no, no, no.
Nope. I am counting. No.

05:19.200 --> 05:20.600
I did not know
that there would be counting

05:20.667 --> 05:21.900
on this job. No.

05:21.967 --> 05:24.967
I'm sorry, but I cannot count.
I might make a mistake.

05:25.033 --> 05:26.533
Wait. What?

05:26.600 --> 05:28.734
But construction workers
count all the time.

05:28.800 --> 05:30.033
- Oh, yeah.

05:30.100 --> 05:31.934
Construction workers
count nails.

05:32.000 --> 05:34.734
They count bricks,
and we measure things.

05:34.800 --> 05:36.266
That's counting, too.

05:36.333 --> 05:38.100
Nope. Nope. No, no,
no. No. I'm sorry.

05:38.166 --> 05:39.100
I must find another job.

05:39.166 --> 05:40.133
I quit.

05:40.200 --> 05:42.100
- Count! Stop, Count.
- The Count!

05:42.166 --> 05:43.367
Construction worker: Hang on!

05:43.433 --> 05:46.533
Aw, now who am I gonna
get to count these nails?

05:46.600 --> 05:49.133
Oh. Um, well,
Elmo will help you.

05:49.200 --> 05:50.734
You will?
- Mm-hmm.

05:50.800 --> 05:52.900
OK. Kid.

05:52.967 --> 05:54.734
Elmo: One...

05:54.800 --> 05:56.667
Two...

05:56.734 --> 06:00.066
Three...

06:00.133 --> 06:02.333
Four...

06:02.400 --> 06:04.967
Five-- five nails altogether.

06:05.033 --> 06:07.767
Thanks, kid. You got
a future in construction.

06:07.834 --> 06:10.100
Oh, well, thank you.

06:10.166 --> 06:12.166
Boy, Elmo just wishes
that he could count

06:12.233 --> 06:13.500
with the Count.

06:13.567 --> 06:16.934
Oh, buddy, I know you're
feeling disappointed right now,

06:17.000 --> 06:18.700
but I'm sure the Count
won't be able

06:18.767 --> 06:20.300
to give up counting
for long.

06:20.367 --> 06:21.867
- Well...
- He loves counting too much.

06:21.934 --> 06:24.233
Count:
Ten, nine...

06:24.300 --> 06:25.800
- Hey...
- Eight...

06:25.867 --> 06:28.166
Uh, that sounds
like the Count.

06:28.233 --> 06:30.200
- And he's counting.
- Backwards. Come on.

06:30.266 --> 06:33.066
Seven, six...

06:33.133 --> 06:34.400
- The Count!
- Count, yo!

06:34.467 --> 06:35.900
Five, four--

06:35.967 --> 06:36.900
Count! Whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

06:36.967 --> 06:38.433
- Count--

06:38.500 --> 06:39.734
What are you doing
in that spaceship, Count?

06:39.800 --> 06:44.266
I am not the Count.
I am the astronaut.

06:44.333 --> 06:46.533
Both:
The astronaut?

06:46.600 --> 06:48.100
Yes. They call me
the astronaut

06:48.166 --> 06:51.967
because I love
to blast off into space.

06:52.033 --> 06:53.834
OK. I get it.

06:53.900 --> 06:55.600
So that's why you were
counting backwards, huh?

06:55.667 --> 06:57.800
Oh, no. I was
counting backwards?

06:57.867 --> 06:58.800
You were.

06:58.867 --> 07:00.967
Oh, no.
Cancel the mission.

07:01.033 --> 07:02.300
Wait. What?

07:02.367 --> 07:04.033
Oh, I cannot
do the countdown.

07:04.100 --> 07:07.033
You see, I must not count.

07:08.300 --> 07:10.600
I do not want
to make a mistake.

07:10.667 --> 07:12.767
What do you mean,
you must not count?

07:12.834 --> 07:13.800
You're an astronaut.

07:13.867 --> 07:15.633
Astronauts count
all the time.

07:15.700 --> 07:18.767
- Yes. They do.

07:18.834 --> 07:20.834
They count moon rocks
and space steps,

07:20.900 --> 07:22.767
and they measure
how far they've gone.

07:22.834 --> 07:25.900
- Oh, I had no idea.

07:25.967 --> 07:27.066
- Yeah. I'm sorry.
- But--

07:27.133 --> 07:29.633
I cannot be an astronaut,
after all.

07:29.700 --> 07:32.367
- I tender my resignation.
- But--

07:32.433 --> 07:35.000
But you've committed
to the program.

07:35.066 --> 07:37.533
Oh, guess I'll have
to blast off myself.

07:37.600 --> 07:40.633
OK, OK, OK. Here we go.

07:40.700 --> 07:42.266
Push the button.
Boop boop boop.

07:42.333 --> 07:44.000
Door is closing.
We are go.

07:44.066 --> 07:46.633
Could one of you please
start the countdown?

07:46.700 --> 07:48.500
- Elmo will help you.
- Oh, thank you.

07:48.567 --> 07:49.834
Ha ha ha!

07:49.900 --> 07:50.967
- Five, four, three,
- Mm-hmm.

07:51.033 --> 07:54.700
two, one, blast off!

07:56.600 --> 07:57.533
- Whoa!
- Wow.

07:57.600 --> 08:02.100
Oh, ho ho ho! Wow.
That was beautiful!

08:02.166 --> 08:04.533
Yeah. It was, but well--

08:04.600 --> 08:06.266
But what?

08:06.333 --> 08:08.166
Well, Elmo just really
wants to count

08:08.233 --> 08:09.734
with the Count.

08:09.800 --> 08:12.133
Oh, I hear you, buddy.

08:12.200 --> 08:14.834
Elmo, I have an idea.

08:14.900 --> 08:16.266
What?

08:16.333 --> 08:17.700
Maybe we can get him
to count again, hmm?

08:17.767 --> 08:19.934
- Come on. Come with me.

08:20.000 --> 08:21.667
OK.

08:23.767 --> 08:25.633
Hey, Elmo, check it out.

08:25.700 --> 08:27.467
Look at all these pretzels.

08:27.533 --> 08:28.800
Ooh.

08:28.867 --> 08:30.467
I wonder
how many are there.

08:30.533 --> 08:32.133
Uh-huh...
Oh, that's Elmo.

08:32.200 --> 08:36.667
Um, oh. Maybe the Count
can count them.

08:36.734 --> 08:38.467
Huh
- No.

08:38.533 --> 08:41.000
I am out of the counting
business, remember?

08:41.066 --> 08:43.967
I need ten carrots
right away, please.

08:44.033 --> 08:45.834
My little bunnies
are hungry.

08:45.900 --> 08:48.900
OK. Coming right up,
Mr. Hopper.

08:48.967 --> 08:51.667
I got you covered,
and here we--

08:53.100 --> 08:54.400
Oh, oh, excuse me.

08:54.467 --> 08:56.467
- Wow.
- But--but--

08:56.533 --> 08:58.033
Hello. Hooper's.

08:58.100 --> 09:02.266
Yes? You need
how many cupcakes?

09:02.333 --> 09:06.567
100. OK. Hey, no problem.
Hee hee hee!

09:06.633 --> 09:08.333
I have a problem.

09:08.400 --> 09:11.500
Uh, Count, do you think
you could help me out?

09:11.567 --> 09:13.400
I've got to go get some
cupcakes out the back,

09:13.467 --> 09:15.300
so do you think you could
count out ten carrots

09:15.367 --> 09:16.300
for Mr. Hopper
over here?

09:16.367 --> 09:18.633
Oh, if only I could, Chris.

09:18.700 --> 09:19.834
Oh, Elmo will try.

09:19.900 --> 09:22.100
- Thank you, Elmo.
- Sure. OK. Let's see.

09:22.166 --> 09:25.400
OK, so that's one carrot,

09:25.467 --> 09:27.934
two, three,

09:28.033 --> 09:28.967
four--

09:29.033 --> 09:31.100
Please hurry!

09:31.166 --> 09:33.333
OK, Mr. Hopper. Now,
where was Elmo? Uh, OK.

09:33.400 --> 09:35.633
Elmo: Four, five, six,
seven, eight, nine.

09:35.700 --> 09:38.066
But I need ten carrots!

09:38.133 --> 09:41.133
Wait. I believe you
made a mistake, Elmo.

09:41.200 --> 09:42.800
Oh, a mistake?

09:42.867 --> 09:45.500
Yes. You said four twice.

09:45.567 --> 09:47.433
You should count
the carrots again.

09:47.500 --> 09:50.500
Oh, Elmo can't do
that, the Count.

09:50.567 --> 09:52.400
Elmo made a mistake,

09:52.467 --> 09:55.467
so Elmo's gonna
give up counting.

09:55.533 --> 09:57.367
- Give up.

09:57.433 --> 09:59.033
No. No, no, no.
Elmo, no.

09:59.100 --> 10:01.133
Elmo, everybody
makes mistakes.

10:01.200 --> 10:03.000
You cannot give up.

10:03.066 --> 10:06.000
The important thing
is to keep trying.

10:06.066 --> 10:08.200
But the Count gave up

10:08.266 --> 10:10.600
when the Count
made a mistake.

10:10.667 --> 10:12.800
Oh, well, that was
different, Elmo.

10:12.867 --> 10:14.934
I am the Count, and--

10:15.000 --> 10:17.667
- Oh, you are right, Elmo.
- Uh-huh.

10:17.734 --> 10:20.467
My, I did give up,
but I shouldn't have.

10:20.533 --> 10:23.767
I must keep trying,
and you should, too,

10:23.834 --> 10:25.166
- Yeah.
- So, come.

10:25.233 --> 10:26.467
Let's count
the carrots together.

10:26.533 --> 10:27.700
Oh, cool.

10:27.767 --> 10:30.767
Count and Elmo:
One carrot, two carrots,

10:30.834 --> 10:33.867
three, four, five, six,

10:33.934 --> 10:36.300
seven, eight, nine,

10:36.367 --> 10:39.100
- Elmo: Ten!
- Ten carrots altogether.

10:39.166 --> 10:42.200
- Ah ah ah!
- Ah ah ah! Yeah.

10:42.266 --> 10:44.000
Thank you very much.

10:44.066 --> 10:45.533
You're welcome,
Mr. Hopper. Enjoy.

10:45.600 --> 10:46.800
- Good-bye.
- Ha ha ha.

10:46.867 --> 10:47.934
Oh, so does this mean

10:48.000 --> 10:50.567
that the Count
will count with Elmo?

10:50.633 --> 10:52.934
Yes, Elmo,
as much as you want.

10:53.000 --> 10:54.266
Oh, yay!

10:54.333 --> 10:55.400
Oh, oh, Chris, Chris,

10:55.467 --> 10:57.967
the Count
is counting again.

10:58.033 --> 10:58.967
Oh, that's awesome.
All right.

10:59.033 --> 11:00.233
Yeah.

11:00.300 --> 11:01.233
What shall
we count first?

11:01.300 --> 11:05.433
How about 100 cupcakes?

11:05.500 --> 11:07.266
- Wow!
- Ohh, let's do it.

11:07.333 --> 11:08.633
- You go first, Elmo.
- OK.

11:08.700 --> 11:10.533
- Elmo: One cupcake...
- Count: Two cupcakes.

11:10.600 --> 11:11.633
- Three...
- Four...

11:11.700 --> 11:13.066
- Five...
- Six...

11:13.133 --> 11:14.133
- Seven...
- Eight...

11:14.200 --> 11:15.333
- Nine...
- Ten...

11:15.400 --> 11:17.900

11:59.400 --> 12:00.367
Hello there.

12:00.433 --> 12:01.533
It is your old pal,
Grover,

12:01.600 --> 12:03.300
and this is Laurie.

12:03.367 --> 12:04.734
Hi.

12:04.800 --> 12:07.633
The letter "C"
is for "c-c-counting,"

12:07.700 --> 12:08.934
and today Laurie is going

12:09.000 --> 12:10.934
to help us count to five

12:11.000 --> 12:12.433
with a very special
talent of hers

12:12.500 --> 12:13.500
I cannot wait
for you to see.

12:13.567 --> 12:14.500
Oh, I'm so excited.

12:14.567 --> 12:15.900
Laurie, you tell them
about it.

12:15.967 --> 12:18.000
Right, so, I'm going
to do cartwheels,

12:18.066 --> 12:19.400
and Grover is
going to count them.

12:19.467 --> 12:21.633
- I am ready.

12:21.700 --> 12:23.934
- OK.
- OK.

12:24.000 --> 12:27.667
Oh, boy. There she goes.

12:27.734 --> 12:31.033
Oh, wow. Would you
look at her go?

12:31.100 --> 12:35.734
How does she do that?
Oh, she is incredible. Oh!

12:35.800 --> 12:37.667
Oh, that-- wait.

12:37.734 --> 12:38.667
Did you do five
cartwheels already?

12:38.734 --> 12:40.100
How many was that?

12:40.166 --> 12:41.266
Grover, you were supposed
to count, remember?

12:41.333 --> 12:43.066
Oh, yes. Yes. I know.

12:43.133 --> 12:44.100
I was just so amazed

12:44.166 --> 12:46.266
by your
wonderful cartwheels.

12:46.333 --> 12:47.333
You deserve a medal.

12:47.400 --> 12:48.867
Aw, thanks.
Well, it's no problem.

12:48.934 --> 12:51.066
- We'll do it again.
- Great idea.

12:51.133 --> 12:53.266
You cartwheel.
I will count.

12:53.333 --> 12:55.834
- OK. Here I go.
- OK.

12:55.900 --> 12:57.734
There she goes.

12:57.800 --> 12:59.834
OK, I'm going
to count this time.

12:59.900 --> 13:01.567
One, two--

13:01.633 --> 13:03.700
Oh! I've got
to capture this.

13:03.767 --> 13:07.300
Oh, yes. Yes!

13:07.367 --> 13:10.800
Oh! That was amazing.
Oh, wow!

13:10.867 --> 13:12.667
Did you count to five?

13:12.734 --> 13:15.700
Um, whoops.
Heh heh. No.

13:15.767 --> 13:16.834
I was taking pictures

13:16.900 --> 13:18.467
of your cartwheels
for my mommy.

13:18.533 --> 13:21.367
You want to see?
Oh, no.

13:21.433 --> 13:25.467
They all came out blurry
for some reason. Ohh!

13:25.533 --> 13:27.700
OK. Well, you know what?

13:27.767 --> 13:28.700
You keep taking pictures,

13:28.767 --> 13:29.700
and I'll do cartwheels

13:29.767 --> 13:31.066
and count.

13:31.133 --> 13:33.767
You would
do that for me?

13:33.834 --> 13:35.266
Oh, yes.
That would be great.

13:35.333 --> 13:37.500
Yes. Thank you,
oh, and if you could,

13:37.567 --> 13:39.100
try to be a little
less blurry this time.

13:39.166 --> 13:40.100
That would be perfect.

13:40.166 --> 13:41.834
- Less blurry.
- Yeah.

13:41.900 --> 13:43.767
- OK.
- Yeah.

13:43.834 --> 13:48.433
- OK.
- OK. Here we go. OK.

13:48.500 --> 13:51.233
One...

13:51.300 --> 13:52.834
Two...

13:52.900 --> 13:54.467
Three...

13:54.533 --> 13:56.066
Four...

13:56.133 --> 13:57.700
Five.

13:57.767 --> 14:00.266
Wow! Yes!
Oh, wow, Laurie.

14:00.333 --> 14:02.734
You are not only good
at doing cartwheels,

14:02.800 --> 14:06.667
but you are great
at "c-c-counting," as well.

14:06.734 --> 14:09.033
Aww, thanks, Grover.

14:09.100 --> 14:10.767
Aww...

14:10.834 --> 14:11.767
"Counting."
the letter "C."

14:11.834 --> 14:13.066
Oh, I think I was

14:13.133 --> 14:15.033
in selfie mode with that.

14:15.100 --> 14:16.400
Oh, dear.

14:22.266 --> 14:24.000
Jesteros needs
a new king or queen,

14:24.066 --> 14:27.400
and to decide,
we will play a game--

14:27.467 --> 14:29.900
a game of chairs!

14:29.967 --> 14:31.367
Woman and man: Huzzah!

14:31.433 --> 14:33.400
And here to tell you
how to play the game

14:33.467 --> 14:37.133
is Grover Bluejoy.

14:37.200 --> 14:38.800
Grover Bluejoy?

14:38.867 --> 14:40.333
Where is Grover Bluejoy?

14:40.400 --> 14:42.033
Sorry I am late,
but it was really hard

14:42.100 --> 14:43.300
getting over
that wall out there.

14:43.367 --> 14:45.533
Whoa!

14:45.600 --> 14:47.934
Just tell everyone how
to play the game.

14:48.000 --> 14:49.900
Oh, right.

14:49.967 --> 14:52.033
The game of chairs
is played

14:52.100 --> 14:54.800
with a deck of cards.

14:54.867 --> 14:56.800
- No, it's not.
- Of course it is not.

14:56.867 --> 14:58.300
Ha ha!

14:58.367 --> 15:00.066
Who said that? Ha ha!

15:00.133 --> 15:01.600
The game of chairs
is played with marbles.

15:01.667 --> 15:03.667
Music will play,

15:03.734 --> 15:08.133
and then these
four players

15:08.200 --> 15:09.667
who want to be
king or queen

15:09.734 --> 15:13.300
will march
around these
three chairs.

15:13.367 --> 15:17.100
When the music stops,
they will each try and sit

15:17.166 --> 15:18.300
in a chair.

15:18.367 --> 15:20.367
They will continue
to compete to be the king

15:20.433 --> 15:24.667
or queen until there
is one chair left.

15:24.734 --> 15:26.834
That is the game of chairs!

15:26.900 --> 15:29.066
Music!

15:35.367 --> 15:36.767
Stop the music.

15:36.834 --> 15:37.967
What?

15:38.033 --> 15:39.800
I said,
"stop the music."

15:39.867 --> 15:41.667
Sorry.
I cannot hear you
over this music.

15:41.734 --> 15:43.200
Stop the music!

15:43.266 --> 15:45.100
- Ow!
- Whoa!

15:45.166 --> 15:46.533
Ow! Ohh!

15:46.600 --> 15:49.033
Oh. Here.
Let me help you up.

15:51.467 --> 15:53.133
Oh. My baby's sad
because we lost.

15:53.200 --> 15:56.767
Aw. I am sorry,
little-- whoa!

15:56.834 --> 16:00.200
A mommy of dragons?

16:00.266 --> 16:01.233
Oh. Heh heh--
No need to get hot

16:01.300 --> 16:02.834
under the diaper.

16:02.900 --> 16:03.967
Dragon:

16:04.033 --> 16:06.133
Ha ha ha!
Heh heh heh.

16:06.200 --> 16:08.667
Uh, so how many
players are left?

16:08.734 --> 16:10.633
Let us count.

16:10.700 --> 16:14.767
We have one, two,
three players

16:14.834 --> 16:17.834
and one, two, three chairs.

16:17.900 --> 16:19.400
Three chairs
and three players.

16:19.467 --> 16:22.300
Can we hurry this up?
I have a wedding to get to.

16:22.367 --> 16:23.734
Oh, right.

16:23.800 --> 16:25.600
Remove one
of the chairs.

16:25.667 --> 16:30.700
Ah. Yes. Removing
one of the chairs.

16:33.066 --> 16:36.834
Sorry about the floor.

16:36.900 --> 16:40.467
Now, there are one,
two chairs left

16:40.533 --> 16:43.800
and three players.

16:43.867 --> 16:45.967
Let's continue the game.

16:46.033 --> 16:47.200
Music!

16:47.266 --> 16:48.667
Music!

16:55.433 --> 16:56.567
Stop the music.

16:56.633 --> 16:57.667
What?

16:57.734 --> 16:59.100
Stop the music.

16:59.166 --> 17:00.166
Whoa! Whoa!

17:00.233 --> 17:01.400
Ow!

17:01.467 --> 17:04.633
Ohh.

17:04.700 --> 17:06.467
Oh! Am I out?

17:06.533 --> 17:07.767
Yes. I am sorry.

17:07.834 --> 17:09.367
It looks like
you choked, Joffrey.

17:10.834 --> 17:12.734
Waah!

17:12.800 --> 17:14.233
So how many
players are left?

17:14.300 --> 17:16.100
Let us count.

17:16.166 --> 17:18.367
There are one,
two players...

17:18.433 --> 17:19.467
Two players.

17:19.533 --> 17:20.867
And one, two chairs.

17:20.934 --> 17:22.166
Two chairs.

17:22.233 --> 17:24.100
Now, remove
one more chair.

17:24.166 --> 17:25.200
Ah.

17:25.266 --> 17:27.533
Removing one more chair!

17:29.700 --> 17:33.400
Oh! Really should get
some wheels on these things.

17:33.467 --> 17:37.066
That leaves one chair
and two players.

17:37.133 --> 17:39.900
The one person to sit
in this one chair

17:39.967 --> 17:41.300
will be the next king

17:41.367 --> 17:43.467
or queen of Jesteros!

17:43.533 --> 17:44.700
Music!

17:44.767 --> 17:46.066
Music!

17:50.734 --> 17:52.867
And stop the music.

17:52.934 --> 17:53.967
What?

17:54.033 --> 17:55.667
Stop the music.

17:55.734 --> 17:57.333
Whoa!

17:57.400 --> 17:58.700
- Ohh!
- Ow.

17:58.767 --> 18:00.700
There is one chair,

18:00.767 --> 18:03.767
and only one person
can be in that chair,

18:03.834 --> 18:05.667
and that person is...

18:07.834 --> 18:09.133
Hello!

18:09.200 --> 18:11.200
All: You?!

18:11.266 --> 18:13.300
I'm telling

Wait for it.

20:44.200 --> 20:46.000
Counting!

20:46.066 --> 20:50.166
Yeah! Whoa, pretty clouds.

20:50.233 --> 20:53.300
Let's count them to see

21:04.200 --> 21:05.900
Yeah!

21:05.967 --> 21:08.333
Boy, Elmo loves counting

21:08.400 --> 21:10.467
and wants to find out more.

21:10.533 --> 21:14.333
Hey! Let's ask
Elmo's friend, Smartie.

21:14.400 --> 21:15.967
Let's call her together.

21:16.033 --> 21:18.066
Elmo and kids:
♪ Oh, Smartie! ♪

21:18.133 --> 21:21.033
( Smartie playing
"Elmo's World" theme )

21:21.100 --> 21:24.400
Five, four, three--

21:24.467 --> 21:25.734
Count down with me, Elmo.

21:25.800 --> 21:27.867
Smartie and Elmo: Two, one!

21:27.934 --> 21:30.567
- Whoo-hoo!
- Yay!

21:30.633 --> 21:33.467
Boy, Smartie sure does
love counting.

21:33.533 --> 21:35.600
You've got
my number, Elmo.

21:35.667 --> 21:37.033
Get it

21:37.100 --> 21:38.333
- Ha ha ha!
- Counting.

21:38.400 --> 21:39.767
Counting, yeah!

21:39.834 --> 21:41.166
Boy, Elmo wants
to find out

21:41.233 --> 21:42.900
more about numbers.

21:42.967 --> 21:44.533
Well, what do we do

21:44.600 --> 21:46.433
when we want
to learn something new?

21:46.500 --> 21:49.700
All: We look it up.

21:49.767 --> 21:51.266
Searching for counting.

21:51.333 --> 21:53.233
Counting is so much fun.

21:53.300 --> 21:55.033
And you can do it
all sorts of ways.

21:55.100 --> 21:58.934
You can count your eyes--
One, two--

21:59.000 --> 22:01.633
and your nose.
One nose.

22:01.700 --> 22:03.667
You can count the trucks
in the sandbox.

22:03.734 --> 22:07.667
One, two, three trucks
altogether.

22:07.734 --> 22:12.667
Smartie and kids:
One, two, three, four.

22:12.734 --> 22:13.900
Four jumps.

22:13.967 --> 22:17.633
Wow! Cool.
Thank you, Smartie.

22:17.700 --> 22:20.133
You can always
count on me.

22:20.200 --> 22:21.333
See you later.

22:21.400 --> 22:24.633
Ha ha ha! Bye-bye!
Heh heh heh!

22:24.700 --> 22:28.000
Boy, there's so many
different ways to count.

22:28.066 --> 22:32.266
Hey! That gives Elmo an idea.

22:32.333 --> 22:34.934
Oh! Let's play a game together.

22:35.000 --> 22:37.633
Yeah. Come on,
come on. Ha ha ha!

22:43.934 --> 22:45.367
Oh! Elmo wonders

22:45.433 --> 22:48.333
if we can match
the right number of hats

22:48.400 --> 22:49.867
to the penguins.

22:49.934 --> 22:51.166
Are you ready?

22:51.233 --> 22:52.800
Let's play.

22:52.867 --> 22:54.633
Elmo:
First, let's count to find out

22:54.700 --> 22:56.300
how many penguins there are.

22:56.367 --> 23:00.467
Kids and Elmo:
One, two, three, four, five.

23:00.533 --> 23:02.333
Five penguins.

23:02.400 --> 23:07.734
So they need five hats--
one for each penguin.

23:07.800 --> 23:10.834
Oh, let's try these.

23:10.900 --> 23:13.600
Uh

23:13.667 --> 23:14.767
Let's count.

23:14.834 --> 23:17.367
Elmo and kids:
One, two, three.

23:17.433 --> 23:19.000
Kids: Oh, no!

23:19.066 --> 23:21.400
Girl:
Two penguins don't have hats.

23:21.467 --> 23:23.400
We need more hats.

23:23.467 --> 23:25.066
Hey, let's try this group.

23:25.133 --> 23:29.200
Elmo and kids:
One, two, three, four, five.

23:29.266 --> 23:31.567
Five hats altogether.

23:31.633 --> 23:34.400
Elmo:
Yay! We did it.

23:34.467 --> 23:37.367
Five hats for five penguins.

23:37.433 --> 23:41.467
Wow! Snazzy hats,
penguins.

23:41.533 --> 23:44.834
Boy, there's so much
to learn about counting,

23:44.900 --> 23:48.533
and that makes Elmo
wonder even more.

23:48.600 --> 23:51.166
Does Mr. Noodle like to count?

23:51.233 --> 23:52.800
Hey, let's ask him, OK?

23:52.867 --> 23:55.266
Hey, Mr. Noodle!

23:55.333 --> 23:59.567
Oh! It's Mr. Noodle's
poodle, Schmoodle.

23:59.633 --> 24:01.700
Elmo and kids: Hi, Schmoodle.

24:01.767 --> 24:04.967
Elmo: Oh, Schmoodle,
do you like to count?

24:06.233 --> 24:08.200
You do?
Oh, show us, Schmoodle.

24:08.266 --> 24:11.266
Kid:
Yeah, show us how you count.

24:11.333 --> 24:13.000
Elmo: How many toys
does Schmoodle have?

24:13.066 --> 24:14.000
Kids: One.

24:14.066 --> 24:16.700
Kid: That's one toy.

24:16.767 --> 24:18.967
Girl: Now he has two.

24:19.033 --> 24:23.100
Elmo: Does Schmoodle
have any more toys?

24:23.166 --> 24:25.333
Girl:
Hey, where's Schmoodle going?

24:25.400 --> 24:27.700
Kids:
That's one, two, three.

24:27.767 --> 24:29.333
Elmo: Three toys!

24:29.400 --> 24:31.166
Boy, so many toys, Schmoodle.

24:33.834 --> 24:36.066
Elmo and kids: Wow!

24:36.133 --> 24:37.967
Elmo: Elmo can't count
that high yet, Schmoodle.

24:38.033 --> 24:39.934
Kids: That's a lot.

24:40.000 --> 24:42.166
Thanks for counting
with us, Schmoodle.

24:42.233 --> 24:44.567
- Bye-bye.
