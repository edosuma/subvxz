00:20.100 --> 00:22.767

As I was saying,

And I got my socks, too.

02:45.700 --> 02:46.934
Okay. Let's see.

02:46.934 --> 02:50.333
I got one sock
and two socks.

02:50.333 --> 02:53.533
Now that's a pair,
and, oh, one--

02:53.533 --> 02:55.367
uh-oh.

02:55.367 --> 02:57.133
A sock is missing.

02:57.133 --> 02:59.300
See, every sock comes in,
you know, pairs.

02:59.300 --> 03:01.066
See how these two
is a pair?

03:01.066 --> 03:02.600
One, two?

03:02.600 --> 03:06.166
Well, where's the match
for this sock?

03:06.166 --> 03:07.233
Hmm.

03:07.233 --> 03:09.133
- Ohh!
- Oh, my goodness!

03:09.133 --> 03:11.400
Where am I?

03:11.400 --> 03:14.333
Well, you're under that towel
I was trying to fold!

03:14.333 --> 03:16.066
Oh, well,
I'm sorry.

03:16.066 --> 03:18.834
One can't even fold
a towel in peace here.

03:18.834 --> 03:20.066
Yeesh!

03:20.066 --> 03:22.834
Oh, dear. I meant to pop in
at the playground.

03:22.834 --> 03:26.433
I want to show Elmo
my new "Two" trick.

03:26.433 --> 03:27.700
- Yeah.

03:27.700 --> 03:30.967
I learned how to turn
one thing into two things.

03:30.967 --> 03:32.133
- Ha ha!

03:32.133 --> 03:34.633
You think you can do that
for my sock over here?

03:34.633 --> 03:37.967
Of course I can.
Watch this!

03:37.967 --> 03:39.300
Ahem.

03:39.300 --> 03:41.567
Oogo-boogo, binky-boo,

03:41.567 --> 03:44.767
turn Chris's one sock
into two!

03:44.767 --> 03:46.900
Uh. Oh.

03:46.900 --> 03:48.900
Yo.

03:48.900 --> 03:50.333
I did it, I did it,
I did it!

03:50.333 --> 03:52.133
Groovy laundromat.

03:52.133 --> 03:54.166
But they're not exactly
a pair.

03:54.166 --> 03:55.734
See, they don't match.

03:55.734 --> 03:57.233
What--
what do you mean?

03:57.233 --> 03:59.467
I think we go good together.

03:59.467 --> 04:02.133
I'm not saying
you two can't be friends.

04:02.133 --> 04:04.867
I'm just saying I need
a pair of socks that match.

04:04.867 --> 04:07.333
You see, this is
a striped sock.

04:07.333 --> 04:09.400
You have polka dots.

04:09.400 --> 04:12.133
Purple polka dots,
if you please.

04:12.133 --> 04:13.700
Okay.
And you talk. Yeah.

04:13.700 --> 04:16.900
Will you look at that?

04:16.900 --> 04:19.800
It's a sock swimming pool!

04:19.800 --> 04:22.467
Oh, ho!
I am gonna take a dip.

04:22.467 --> 04:24.767
Ha ha! Gangway!

04:24.767 --> 04:26.834
- Yee, hoo hoo hooey!
- Wow!

04:28.900 --> 04:30.934
Oh, well,
don't worry, Chris.

04:30.934 --> 04:33.233
I'll get you a sock
that looks like yours.

04:33.233 --> 04:35.867
There's this great trick
my mommy does

04:35.867 --> 04:37.900
when she wants
more of something.

04:37.900 --> 04:41.734
It's called
the "More" trick.

04:41.734 --> 04:43.266
Uh, that's okay,
Abby.

04:43.266 --> 04:44.734
Oh, and you're in luck!

04:44.734 --> 04:47.600
I think I know
the magic rhyme.

04:47.600 --> 04:51.133
Inky, blinky, sneeze,
and snore.

04:51.133 --> 04:53.066
Forget the polka-dot sock.

04:53.066 --> 04:55.066
Let's have some more.

04:55.066 --> 04:56.066
Ha ha!

04:56.066 --> 05:00.266
Ah, me,
a laundering emporium.

05:00.266 --> 05:03.867
As the great sock thinker
Sockrates once said,

05:03.867 --> 05:06.166
"Something is afoot!"

05:06.166 --> 05:10.200
Ha ha! There.
Is that more like it?

05:10.200 --> 05:14.100
Well...
he looks smart.

05:14.100 --> 05:17.233
Oh, I am very smart.
Heh heh heh.

05:17.233 --> 05:18.967
Okay, but do you look
like my sock?

05:18.967 --> 05:22.567
Oh. Well, let's see.
Oh! I should say not!

05:22.567 --> 05:24.433
That's a stripy sock,

05:24.433 --> 05:27.967
and I'm an argyle
with diamond shapes

05:27.967 --> 05:30.633
and proud
of every one of them!

more like yours, huh?

05:49.734 --> 05:52.133
Well, let's see.

05:52.133 --> 05:54.133
Looks like he does
have stripes,

05:54.133 --> 05:56.166
but his stripes
are blue.

05:56.166 --> 05:58.100
My stripes are red.

05:58.100 --> 06:00.133
Yep. He looks like
a gym sock.

06:00.133 --> 06:04.200
I am a gym sock
and in tip-top shape, too.

06:04.200 --> 06:07.100

this trick of yours gonna make?

06:24.700 --> 06:26.567

06:28.000 --> 06:30.533
Aw, look at
the little baby sock.

06:31.867 --> 06:33.934
Uh-uh.
That's definitely not mine.

06:36.166 --> 06:39.300
Aw, you hurt
the wee one's feelings.

06:39.300 --> 06:41.166
Come on, you wee bairn.

06:41.166 --> 06:42.433

Hello there, Miss Farmer lady.
We need grapes.

14:12.066 --> 14:14.400
We have lots of grapes
here in our vineyard.

14:14.400 --> 14:18.166
Farmer:
Grapes are a type of healthy
fruit that grow on vines.

14:18.166 --> 14:22.333
They can be red, green,
and even purple.

14:22.333 --> 14:24.967
Some have seeds inside them,
and some have no seeds.

14:24.967 --> 14:26.900
Cookie Monster:
Oh, yeah, yeah.
That the kind we need.

14:26.900 --> 14:30.166
Farmer:
Some of these grapes
will even become raisins.

14:30.166 --> 14:32.233
Gonger and Cookie Monster:
Raisins come from grapes?

14:32.233 --> 14:33.900
Cookie Monster:
That's amazing.

14:33.900 --> 14:35.633
Farmer:
It is amazing.

14:35.633 --> 14:37.934
When the grapes
are ripe and sweet enough,

14:37.934 --> 14:39.967
they're picked
and put in crates.

14:41.600 --> 14:44.433
Those crates are then
sent to markets,

14:44.433 --> 14:47.033
grocery stores,
and fruit stands.

14:48.300 --> 14:50.300
Hope this helps.
Good luck.

Kid:
Uh-oh. No more bones.

19:57.834 --> 19:58.900
Kid:
Heh heh.

19:58.900 --> 20:02.533
Five dogs, five bones.

20:24.367 --> 20:28.834
Oh, guess what Elmo is
wondering about today.

20:28.834 --> 20:30.600
Wait for it.

20:30.600 --> 20:33.233
Wai-ai-ait for it.

20:33.233 --> 20:35.333
Counting!

20:35.333 --> 20:39.300
Yeah!
Whoa, pretty clouds.

20:39.300 --> 20:42.433
Let's count them to see
how many there are.

Five clouds altogether.

20:53.266 --> 20:55.233
Yeah!

20:55.233 --> 20:57.433
Boy, Elmo loves counting

20:57.433 --> 20:59.567
and wants to find out more.

20:59.567 --> 21:03.433
Hey! Let's ask
Elmo's friend, Smartie.

21:03.433 --> 21:05.333
Let's call her together.

21:05.333 --> 21:07.800
Elmo and kids:

21:15.000 --> 21:17.166
Smartie and Elmo:
Two, one!

21:17.166 --> 21:19.734
- Smartie: Whoo-hoo!
- Elmo: Yay!

21:19.734 --> 21:22.600
Boy, Smartie sure does
love counting.

21:22.600 --> 21:24.934
You've got my number,
Elmo.

21:24.934 --> 21:26.367
Get it

21:26.367 --> 21:27.467
- Elmo: Ha ha ha!
- Smartie: Counting.

21:27.467 --> 21:29.100
Counting, yeah!

21:29.100 --> 21:32.200
Boy, Elmo wants to find out
more about numbers.

21:32.200 --> 21:33.834
Well, what do we do

21:33.834 --> 21:35.533
when we want to learn
something new?

21:35.533 --> 21:38.633
All:
We look it up.

21:38.633 --> 21:40.367
Searching for counting.

21:40.367 --> 21:42.367
Counting is so much fun.

21:42.367 --> 21:44.800
And you can do it
all sorts of ways.

21:44.800 --> 21:48.200
You can count your eyes.
One, two.

21:48.200 --> 21:50.600
And your nose.
One nose.

21:50.600 --> 21:53.000
You can count the trucks
in the sandbox.

21:53.000 --> 21:57.433
One, two, three trucks
altogether.

21:57.433 --> 22:02.000
Kids:
One, two, three, four.

22:02.000 --> 22:03.233
Smartie:
Four jumps.

22:03.233 --> 22:06.934
Wow! Cool.
Thank you, Smartie.

22:06.934 --> 22:09.233
You can always
count on me.

22:09.233 --> 22:10.367
See you later.

22:10.367 --> 22:13.867
Ha ha ha! Bye-bye!
Heh heh heh!

22:13.867 --> 22:17.767
Boy, there's so many different
ways to count.

22:17.767 --> 22:21.400
Hey!
That gives Elmo an idea.

22:21.400 --> 22:24.266
Oh!
Let's play a game together.

22:24.266 --> 22:27.800
Yeah. Come on, come on.
Ha ha ha!

22:33.166 --> 22:37.433
Oh! Elmo wonders if we can match
the right number of hats

22:37.433 --> 22:38.867
to the penguins.

22:38.867 --> 22:40.033
Are you ready?

22:40.033 --> 22:41.633
Let's play.

22:41.633 --> 22:45.367
First, let's count to find out
how many penguins there are.

22:45.367 --> 22:49.567
Kids and Elmo:
One, two, three, four, five.

22:49.567 --> 22:51.433
Five penguins.

22:51.433 --> 22:55.000
Elmo:
So they need five hats,

22:55.000 --> 22:57.033
one for each penguin.

22:57.033 --> 23:00.200
Oh, let's try these.

23:00.200 --> 23:02.900
Uh-oh.
How many hats are there?

23:02.900 --> 23:04.066
Let's count.

23:04.066 --> 23:06.700
Kids and Elmo:
One, two, three.

23:06.700 --> 23:08.300
Kids:
Oh, no!

23:08.300 --> 23:10.433
Girl:
Two penguins don't have hats.

23:10.433 --> 23:12.400
Elmo:
We need more hats.

23:12.400 --> 23:14.266
Hey, let's try this group.

23:14.266 --> 23:18.266
Kids and Elmo:
One, two, three, four, five.

23:18.266 --> 23:20.834
Five hats altogether.

23:20.834 --> 23:23.500
Elmo:
Yay! We did it.

23:23.500 --> 23:27.133
Five hats for five penguins.

23:27.133 --> 23:30.567
Wow!
Snazzy hats, penguins.

23:30.567 --> 23:34.133
Boy, there's so much
to learn about counting,

23:34.133 --> 23:37.834
and that makes
Elmo wonder even more.

23:37.834 --> 23:40.266
Does Mr. Noodle
like to count?

23:40.266 --> 23:42.100
Hey, let's ask him, okay?

23:42.100 --> 23:44.333
Kids and Elmo:
Hey, Mr. Noodle!

23:44.333 --> 23:49.166
Oh! It's Mr. Noodle's poodle,
Schmoodle.

23:49.166 --> 23:50.967
Kids and Elmo:
Hi, Schmoodle.

23:50.967 --> 23:54.033
Elmo:
Oh, Schmoodle,
do you like to count?

23:55.300 --> 23:57.333
Elmo:
You do?
Oh, show us, Schmoodle.

23:57.333 --> 24:00.400
Kid:
Yeah, show us how you count.

24:00.400 --> 24:02.900
Elmo:
How many toys
does Schmoodle have?

24:02.900 --> 24:05.633
- Kids and Elmo: One.
- Kid: That's one toy.

24:05.633 --> 24:08.333
Now he has two.

24:08.333 --> 24:10.600
Elmo:
Does Schmoodle
have any more toys?

24:12.166 --> 24:14.266
Kid:
Hey, where's Schmoodle going?

24:14.266 --> 24:16.834
Kids:
That's one, two, three.

24:16.834 --> 24:18.233
Elmo:
Three toys.

24:18.233 --> 24:21.033
Boy, so many toys,
Schmoodle.

24:23.533 --> 24:25.166
Elmo and kids:
Wow!

24:25.166 --> 24:27.367
Elmo:
Elmo can't count
that high yet, Schmoodle.

24:27.367 --> 24:28.633
Kids:
That's a lot.

24:28.633 --> 24:31.300
Thanks for counting
with us, Schmoodle.

24:31.300 --> 24:33.500
- Bye-bye.
- Kids: Bye, Schmoodle!

24:33.500 --> 24:37.100
Learning new things
makes Elmo so happy,

24:37.100 --> 24:39.433
