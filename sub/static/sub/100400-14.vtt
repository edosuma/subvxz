WEBVTT

00:08.342 --> 00:10.219
Oh...my God.

00:10.219 --> 00:11.511
O-Oh, my God.

00:11.511 --> 00:11.887
Oh, my God.

00:11.887 --> 00:12.763
I look ridiculous.

00:12.763 --> 00:13.639
You look...

00:13.639 --> 00:15.265
...festive.

00:15.265 --> 00:18.602
Okay, look. Okay.
I-I-I'm   I'm a doctor.

00:18.602 --> 00:20.812
Okay, what if people,
you know...see this?

00:20.812 --> 00:22.272
No, well, better hope
they see it.

00:22.272 --> 00:23.982
We got to sell
like 3,000 of them

00:23.982 --> 00:26.026
to get people to pay
for Pruitt's funeral.

00:26.026 --> 00:29.529
Hey, yo, look,
Pruitt wasn't a proud man.

00:29.529 --> 00:32.866
Maybe we just say a few words
and...you know, pour one out.

00:32.866 --> 00:34.868
No, I-I don't know,
Mr. September.

00:34.868 --> 00:36.370
I think everyone
in the world...
Yeah!

00:36.370 --> 00:37.829
...needs to see this.Yes!

00:37.829 --> 00:40.123
Come on down
to Jack's Farmers Market.
Excellent.

00:40.123 --> 00:42.000
 Ooh, on a hot day  

00:42.000 --> 00:43.669
 Alright, alright,
you know, to be fair,

00:43.669 --> 00:45.212
carrots are good for vision.
What's up, doc?

00:45.212 --> 00:47.714
I'm giving
a good message out.

00:47.714 --> 00:50.634
Um, I'm Andy Herrera.
I used to work here.

00:50.634 --> 00:52.010
-Welcome back.

00:52.010 --> 00:54.596
Thanks, guys.
I missed you.

00:54.596 --> 00:58.058
Um...what is...that?

00:59.518 --> 01:00.978
Oh, my God.

01:00.978 --> 01:02.187
Did you  
 Yeah.

01:02.187 --> 01:03.355
Did you all do one?

01:03.355 --> 01:05.274
Yeah.
It was all Hughes' idea.

01:05.274 --> 01:06.316
I just figured
our Captain

01:06.316 --> 01:07.442
deserves a Captain's
funeral, you know?

01:07.442 --> 01:09.152
 Yes.
And a spaghetti dinner.

01:09.152 --> 01:10.237
Get some foot traffic
in here,

01:10.237 --> 01:12.030
shake the change
out of some neighbors.

01:12.030 --> 01:13.448
Thank you.

01:15.492 --> 01:17.911
I love it. I'm gonna need
at least a case of these.

01:19.121 --> 01:20.163
Morning, 19.

01:20.163 --> 01:21.748
-Chief.
-Morning, Chief.
-Chief.

01:25.711 --> 01:28.839
Warren, if you
have a problem...

01:28.839 --> 01:30.882
I'm still gonna need
my coffee first.

01:46.023 --> 01:47.024
Mm-hmm.

01:47.024 --> 01:48.275
We shouldn't be doing this
at your work.

01:48.275 --> 01:50.736
No. Mnh-mnh.

01:50.736 --> 01:53.030
We are on the taxpayers' dime
right now.

01:53.030 --> 01:55.073
And they are not paying you
to make out with me.

01:55.073 --> 01:56.533
Oh, we could
reimburse them.

01:56.533 --> 01:57.576
Okay.

01:58.577 --> 02:00.078
Yeah?

02:00.078 --> 02:03.123
Hi, Captain Bishop?
Um, sorry to interrupt.

02:03.123 --> 02:05.876
Uh, your mom is here?

02:05.876 --> 02:06.877
Mom.

02:06.877 --> 02:08.461
Hi.

02:08.461 --> 02:09.545
Surprise!

02:11.298 --> 02:13.383
Uh, what are you doing?

02:13.383 --> 02:15.010
You didn't...

02:15.010 --> 02:18.013
Wha  No warning.
Uh, why?

02:18.013 --> 02:20.599
I thought it was finally time
to see where my daughter works.

02:20.599 --> 02:22.017
Big Time Captain.

02:23.310 --> 02:25.312
Hi.
Hi!

02:25.312 --> 02:27.397
Are you one
of Maya's firewomen?

02:27.397 --> 02:29.483
No.
I'm not a firefighter.

02:29.483 --> 02:31.026
I'm Dr. Carina DeLuca.

02:31.026 --> 02:33.070
Oh, you're
my daughter's doctor.

02:33.070 --> 02:35.697
Uh, I am a doctor,
but I'm not Maya's.

02:35.697 --> 02:37.908
I am actually  
Oh. Oh.

02:37.908 --> 02:40.702
Oh, did I walk in
at a bad time?

02:40.702 --> 02:41.661
Oh, my God.
No, no, no, no, no.

02:41.661 --> 02:43.038
I was just about
to leave.

02:43.038 --> 02:45.749
I've already wasted
enough taxpayers' time.

02:45.749 --> 02:47.751
But it was wonderful
to meet you.

02:47.751 --> 02:48.752
Bye.
Bye.

02:48.752 --> 02:49.795
Likewise.

02:52.839 --> 02:54.800
Mom, what are you
doing here?

02:54.800 --> 02:56.385
I...

02:56.385 --> 02:58.887
I left your father.

03:01.306 --> 03:04.142
So, how exactly did you get
the back of your earring

03:04.142 --> 03:05.185
stuck in your ear?

03:05.185 --> 03:06.770
I have no idea.

03:06.770 --> 03:08.480
I woke up, and my hair was,
like, wrapped around it,

03:08.480 --> 03:10.065
and it's one of those
old screw posts,

03:10.065 --> 03:11.775
so it somehow burrowed
into my ear.

03:11.775 --> 03:14.277
It was my grandma's,
and it's worth more than
everything that I own,

03:14.277 --> 03:15.862
and I was scared
if I tried to pull it out,

03:15.862 --> 03:17.197
it might, like,
break the diamond.

03:17.197 --> 03:17.989
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow!

03:17.989 --> 03:20.492
Did I get you?

03:20.492 --> 03:22.202
No.
Nice.

03:22.202 --> 03:23.954
Thank God.
That's for you.

03:23.954 --> 03:25.080
Thank you.

03:25.080 --> 03:27.749
It didn't even hurt.

03:27.749 --> 03:30.585
Alright.
This is a disinfectant.

03:32.587 --> 03:34.339
Ow!
That did hurt!

03:34.339 --> 03:36.425
Alright.
You're all set.

03:36.425 --> 03:38.009
Just, um, make sure

03:38.009 --> 03:40.345
you disinfect twice a day
for the next few days,

03:40.345 --> 03:42.514
and maybe don't go to bed

03:42.514 --> 03:44.474
with your grandmother's
diamonds on?

03:44.474 --> 03:45.475
Okay.

03:49.980 --> 03:52.315
Oh, my God.

03:52.315 --> 03:54.151
This is you?
Oh, no, no.

03:54.151 --> 03:57.320
That is some other person,
named Mr. October.

03:57.320 --> 03:58.405
How much?

03:58.405 --> 04:01.241
It's   It's $25.

04:01.241 --> 04:02.909
Happy to donate
to the cause.

04:02.909 --> 04:05.954
And, well, I don't have
a smooth line for that one.

04:05.954 --> 04:07.581
That's my number.

04:07.581 --> 04:08.623
Okay.

04:08.623 --> 04:10.333
Thank   Thank you.

04:10.333 --> 04:11.626
Sasha Bennett.

04:11.626 --> 04:14.087
Thank you,
Dean Miller.

04:14.087 --> 04:15.755
Bye.

04:15.755 --> 04:17.882
Bye.

04:20.510 --> 04:22.220
Heyyy.

04:22.220 --> 04:23.054
Oh, geez.
She cute.

04:23.054 --> 04:24.306
She cute.

04:24.306 --> 04:25.640
Yeah.
Yeah, she is.

04:25.640 --> 04:26.975
Yeah!
Actually.

04:26.975 --> 04:29.102
I almost didn't notice
until she gave me her card.

04:29.102 --> 04:30.187
How do you not notice?

04:30.187 --> 04:31.813
I don't know.
Uh-huh.

04:31.813 --> 04:33.315
What do you mean,
"Uh-huh"?
Use this.

04:33.315 --> 04:34.816
Dating is, like,
the millionth thing on my mind.

04:34.816 --> 04:38.069
I haven't slept with anybody
since Pru was born.

04:38.069 --> 04:40.489
I don't know. I don't move on
at the speed of light, so  

04:40.489 --> 04:41.656
Hey.

04:41.656 --> 04:42.949
What?
I'm just saying.
What  

04:42.949 --> 04:44.201
No, you're not
just saying.

04:44.201 --> 04:45.368
You're judging out of nowhere
for no reason,

04:45.368 --> 04:46.411
and it's not cool.
What?

04:46.411 --> 04:48.038
I-I lash out
when I'm freaked out!

04:48.038 --> 04:49.539
I don't know  
Okay, you are
a hot single dad

04:49.539 --> 04:51.374
and you got
a hot single girl's number.

04:51.374 --> 04:53.210
Just call her
and climb up on that.

04:54.795 --> 04:56.838
It's good to have you
back at work.

04:56.838 --> 04:58.632
It's good to be back.

04:58.632 --> 05:01.051
I was starting to get
a little stir-crazy.

05:01.051 --> 05:03.303
Yeah?

05:03.303 --> 05:04.554
Where?

05:04.554 --> 05:05.639
What do you mean?

05:05.639 --> 05:07.682
Oh, where were you
going stir-crazy?

05:07.682 --> 05:09.017
I mean, you haven't
been home lately.

05:09.017 --> 05:11.102
It's   It's complicated.

05:11.102 --> 05:12.896
Ah, it's usually
just an address.

05:14.814 --> 05:18.151
Okay, Andy, this isn't about
our...history or whatever.

05:18.151 --> 05:21.696
You're my friend.
And our lives...

05:21.696 --> 05:24.074
You know, with everything that's
happened lately, I'm just  

05:24.074 --> 05:25.534
I'm just asking my friend
if she's  

05:25.534 --> 05:26.493
Sullivan.
It's Sullivan.

05:26.493 --> 05:29.329
I'm sleeping
at Sullivan's.

05:29.329 --> 05:31.373
'Cause we got married.

05:31.373 --> 05:33.542
So, just shut up
about it.

05:35.085 --> 05:36.962
Maya.
Talk to me.

05:36.962 --> 05:38.380
I have an event
to organize, Mom.

05:38.380 --> 05:41.091
We're doing this spaghetti
fundraiser dinner tonight,

05:41.091 --> 05:42.175
and  
Then let me help.

05:42.175 --> 05:43.468
I used to organize
the spaghetti dinners

05:43.468 --> 05:44.803
for your track team.

05:44.803 --> 05:46.555
No, you didn't.
Well, no.

05:46.555 --> 05:49.349
Your   Your father
didn't let me.

05:49.349 --> 05:51.309
He didn't like me
socializing  

05:51.309 --> 05:54.896
Did you come here
just to bad-mouth Dad?

05:54.896 --> 05:57.023
No, honey.

05:57.023 --> 05:59.985
I came here
to talk to you.

05:59.985 --> 06:02.487
And to apologize
for the abuse

06:02.487 --> 06:04.489
because I didn't  
I didn't protect you,

06:04.489 --> 06:07.200
and   and   and that is
a mother's job.

06:07.200 --> 06:08.660
I'm so sorry. I  

06:08.660 --> 06:11.454
What?
What are you talking about?

06:11.454 --> 06:12.789
Maya.

06:12.789 --> 06:14.416
Sweetie, I know
you love your dad  

06:14.416 --> 06:16.126
I do love my dad.

06:16.126 --> 06:18.712
I also literally don't know
what you're talking about.

06:18.712 --> 06:20.297
The silent treatments?

06:20.297 --> 06:21.506
The broken dishes?

06:21.506 --> 06:24.009
The fist-sized holes
in our walls?

06:24.009 --> 06:26.761
The 90-mile-an-hour drives home
from your track meets?

06:26.761 --> 06:27.929
He's emotional.

06:27.929 --> 06:31.683
Yes, and he uses his emotions
to control us.

06:31.683 --> 06:34.519
All of us.

06:34.519 --> 06:37.772
Maya...your father
is abusive.

06:39.899 --> 06:42.444
I was in crisis.

06:42.444 --> 06:44.946
Wow, Mom.

06:44.946 --> 06:46.781
Drama much?

06:46.781 --> 06:49.826
Engine 19,
Ladder 19, Aid Car 19,

06:49.826 --> 06:51.620
reported fire
at bowling alley.

06:51.620 --> 06:53.330
2849 Springfield.
Fire.

06:53.330 --> 06:55.081
Now, that is a crisis.

06:57.542 --> 06:59.711
Maya, wait.

07:02.714 --> 07:04.257
Um, what's up
with you?

07:04.257 --> 07:05.675
My mom.
Your mom?

07:05.675 --> 07:07.469
She's here.
She left my dad, apparently.

07:07.469 --> 07:09.304
She's being dramatic.

07:09.304 --> 07:10.930
Wow.
Bishop has a mom.

07:10.930 --> 07:12.432
Kind of just figured
she grew up

07:12.432 --> 07:13.975
in a secret government
Russian lab somewhere.

07:25.153 --> 07:27.113
Warren,
how can I help you?

07:27.113 --> 07:29.783
There's no comfortable way
to say this, sir.

07:29.783 --> 07:31.618
I'm gonna need you
to pee in a cup.

07:37.874 --> 07:40.126
You know you're beyond
your rank, Warren.

07:40.126 --> 07:41.336
Oh, I could make this
much messier for you, sir,

07:41.336 --> 07:42.879
so I think you should
be grateful

07:42.879 --> 07:44.506
that I'm giving you a quiet
chance to turn yourself in  

07:44.506 --> 07:46.424
Oh, you're giving me
a chance?

07:46.424 --> 07:48.301
Warren, you need to stand down.
And admit that you
performed your duties

07:48.301 --> 07:50.720
while under the influence.
Warren, stand down!

07:50.720 --> 07:53.306
I have never,
would never  

07:53.306 --> 07:55.183
Spoken like
a true addict.

07:59.979 --> 08:01.981
Why did you become
a firefighter, Robert?

08:01.981 --> 08:03.650
Who you calling Robert?

08:03.650 --> 08:05.235
I'm your Battalion Chief.

08:05.235 --> 08:08.405
Why did you become
a firefighter, Robert?

08:08.405 --> 08:10.073
To help people.
Mm-hmm.

08:10.073 --> 08:12.033
To save lives.
Mm-hmm.

08:12.033 --> 08:14.953
Now, how is being high
in a life-or-death situation

08:14.953 --> 08:16.204
gonna do that?

08:16.204 --> 08:17.580
Warren,
you're a doctor.

08:17.580 --> 08:19.833
You of all people should know
that addiction

08:19.833 --> 08:22.377
is not exactly
as you make it out to be.
What I know is that you stole drugs from the PRT,

08:22.377 --> 08:23.837
which is a felony,

08:23.837 --> 08:26.214
and then you persuaded me
to falsify those records,

08:26.214 --> 08:28.425
which is also a felony.

08:28.425 --> 08:31.761
And then you were commander
of multiple fire companies

08:31.761 --> 08:32.846
while under the influence,

08:32.846 --> 08:34.347
which I don't know
if it's a felony,

08:34.347 --> 08:36.474
but it's damn sure a crime.

08:38.643 --> 08:40.562
I miss Joe's bar.

08:40.562 --> 08:41.354
I heard
they're rebuilding.

08:41.354 --> 08:43.106
Still?
It's been two weeks.

08:43.106 --> 08:44.315
What's taking so long?

08:45.525 --> 08:48.528
Hey, w-when did you know?

08:48.528 --> 08:50.405
You know, that   that you
wanted to be a firefighter?

08:50.405 --> 08:52.532
Ha!
I was 7 years old.

08:52.532 --> 08:55.034
You knew that you wanted to be
a firefighter when you were 7?

08:55.034 --> 08:56.703
The red trucks,
the sirens,

08:56.703 --> 08:58.538
the suspenders, the boots.

08:58.538 --> 09:00.415
I loved it all.
How could I be anything else?

09:00.415 --> 09:01.583
Yeah.

09:01.583 --> 09:03.626
Hey, you were a great
firefighter, sir.

09:03.626 --> 09:05.336
I was a good firefighter.

09:05.336 --> 09:08.173
Great firefighters
get good firefighters killed.

09:08.173 --> 09:10.008
You succeed or fail
as a team.

09:10.008 --> 09:12.260
You can paint outside the lines
once in a while,

09:12.260 --> 09:13.845
but it's always
about the team.

09:20.143 --> 09:23.688
So...marriage.

09:23.688 --> 09:24.898
Yep.

09:24.898 --> 09:26.775
I-It's crazy. I know.

09:26.775 --> 09:28.860
Crazy is two exes
moving in together.

09:28.860 --> 09:31.279
This is   I don't know  
disturbing.

09:31.279 --> 09:33.823
Excuse me,
but I'm grieving.

09:33.823 --> 09:35.366
You have to be nice to me.

09:35.366 --> 09:37.702
I never signed anything
that said that.

09:37.702 --> 09:39.829
Andy, you married
your Battalion Chief,

09:39.829 --> 09:42.999
who I assume you've only
been dating for like a month,

09:42.999 --> 09:44.709
because we slept together
not that long ago.

09:44.709 --> 09:48.588
Look, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry I didn't tell you.

09:48.588 --> 09:51.758
Andy, you didn't even tell me
you were dating him.

09:51.758 --> 09:54.135
We haven't talked
since the storage unit.

09:54.135 --> 09:55.512
How are you doing?

09:55.512 --> 09:57.263
No.
No, we're not doing that.

09:57.263 --> 09:58.681
We're not changing
the subject.
You were   You were trapped,

09:58.681 --> 10:00.141
just like
in the skyscraper.

10:00.141 --> 10:02.852
Were you triggered?
Andy, you got married.

10:02.852 --> 10:04.062
That's what
we're talking about.

10:04.062 --> 10:06.105
I'm not   I'm not gonna
defend myself to you.

10:06.105 --> 10:07.106
I'm not asking you to.

10:07.106 --> 10:08.733
I'm asking
if you need help

10:08.733 --> 10:11.027
to back out of what was
a massive, panic-driven mistake.

10:11.027 --> 10:12.654
I was not panicking.

10:12.654 --> 10:13.822
You were panicking
from the minute

10:13.822 --> 10:16.658
you knew your dad
was sick again.

10:16.658 --> 10:19.786
Look, I know
what it looks like.

10:19.786 --> 10:22.831
It was fast.

10:22.831 --> 10:25.458
But I don't regret it.

10:25.458 --> 10:27.752
Because my dad got to
walk me down the aisle.

10:29.295 --> 10:32.173
That's a beautiful thing.

10:32.173 --> 10:33.758
And you'll always
have that memory.

10:35.635 --> 10:37.220
And it's not too late
to get it annulled.

10:37.220 --> 10:39.180
You're not funny.
I'm not joking.

10:49.691 --> 10:51.109
Chief!

10:51.109 --> 10:52.569
You got an assignment
for us?

10:52.569 --> 10:53.987
Yeah, 19,
you're on search and rescue.

10:53.987 --> 10:55.530
I need everybody evacuated
from that building.

10:55.530 --> 10:57.365
And, Cap, structural integrity's
not great.

10:57.365 --> 10:59.075
Be careful in there.
Got it.

10:59.075 --> 11:00.785
19, we're on
search and rescue.

11:00.785 --> 11:02.287
Structural integrity
is compromised.

11:02.287 --> 11:03.538
 Hey, it's okay.

11:03.538 --> 11:04.664
They're trapped.
Okay.

11:04.664 --> 11:05.707
They're all trapped inside.

11:05.707 --> 11:07.375
Who? Who's trapped?
Everyone.

11:07.375 --> 11:09.043
And my grandpa,
he's trapped.

11:09.043 --> 11:10.712
I tried to help him.
Okay.

11:10.712 --> 11:12.171
Okay, don't worry.
We'll get him.

11:12.171 --> 11:13.506
Yeah, we'll get him.
Go, go, go.

11:17.427 --> 11:18.636
Negative.
At least a dozen.

11:18.636 --> 11:20.221
Miller, Montgomery.

11:20.221 --> 11:21.639
Cutler, you're with me.

11:29.772 --> 11:31.190
I'm over here!

11:31.190 --> 11:34.903
Wait, whoa! Watch your step,
Miller. We're on a lane.

11:34.903 --> 11:36.613
Down here!

11:36.613 --> 11:38.364
Bowling IC,
this is Search and Rescue.

11:38.364 --> 11:40.199
We have
a 70-year-old male

11:40.199 --> 11:41.784
who's trapped underneath
pinsetters in lane two.
Thank God.

11:41.784 --> 11:44.162
We're gonna need hydraulic
spreaders and a med kit.

11:44.162 --> 11:45.580
 Seattle F.D.
We're here to get you out.

11:45.580 --> 11:47.081
What's your name?
-Walter.

11:48.541 --> 11:51.044
Airway is clear, but...
there's a lot of bleeding.

11:51.044 --> 11:52.503
A lot or a little?
Enough.

11:52.503 --> 11:55.506
And that's just
what I can see.

11:55.506 --> 11:56.758
Looks like there's
crush injuries.

11:56.758 --> 11:57.759
Let's get it off of him.
Alright.

11:57.759 --> 11:59.260
One, two, three!

12:00.929 --> 12:04.098
Ah. 50 years
I owned this place.

12:04.098 --> 12:05.683
First time
it turned on me.

12:05.683 --> 12:07.268
Walter, I need you
to stay really still, okay?

12:07.268 --> 12:08.895
We're gonna
get you out.

12:08.895 --> 12:11.022
Yeah. My   My granddaughter,
Rachel, did she get out?

12:11.022 --> 12:12.523
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
She got out.

12:12.523 --> 12:14.984
 Miller!
Miller, call out to me!

12:14.984 --> 12:16.569
Hey!
Hey, we're here!

12:16.569 --> 12:18.905
In the back! Watch your step!
It's slippery!

12:18.905 --> 12:20.573
Help's on the way,
Walter.

12:20.573 --> 12:23.201
Did all the other kids
make it out?

12:23.201 --> 12:24.077
What other kids?

12:24.077 --> 12:25.411
Birthday party.

12:25.411 --> 12:27.038
About a dozen of them.

12:27.038 --> 12:28.831
Where?
Near the arcade.

12:33.503 --> 12:35.546
 Captain,
there's a kids birthday party.

12:35.546 --> 12:36.547
I need hands and eyes in here.

12:36.547 --> 12:37.674
Gibson, Dixon!

12:37.674 --> 12:38.841
On it!

12:38.841 --> 12:39.926
Hey, there's still
a threat of collapse.

12:39.926 --> 12:42.178
Work fast.

12:42.178 --> 12:44.847
Dixon!

12:44.847 --> 12:46.182
I can't.

12:46.182 --> 12:47.392
You can't what?

12:47.392 --> 12:49.852
I can't, uh  
I can't go back in there.

12:49.852 --> 12:52.772
I can't go in there.
I think, uh...

12:52.772 --> 12:53.773
I c 

12:53.773 --> 12:55.149
I can't, Captain.

12:55.149 --> 12:56.901
Get to triage,
assist where you can,

12:56.901 --> 12:58.778
and stay the hell
out of my sight.

13:04.575 --> 13:06.619
 Wait, wait, wait.
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

13:06.619 --> 13:07.745
Okay,
that's not gonna work.

13:07.745 --> 13:08.830
When I lift this side,

13:08.830 --> 13:10.123
basically the other side
is crushing him.

13:10.123 --> 13:12.250
We need cribbing.
Got it. I'm on it.

13:14.085 --> 13:15.503
I know that sound.

13:15.503 --> 13:17.588
What sound?
In your voice.

13:17.588 --> 13:19.173
I'm a goner, huh?

13:19.173 --> 13:21.426
No, sir.
You just sit tight.

13:21.426 --> 13:23.886
We will  

13:23.886 --> 13:26.681
Montgomery,
I need that cribbing now!

13:26.681 --> 13:27.682
Right now!

13:33.771 --> 13:35.314
I would like to get
the truth out of you.

13:37.817 --> 13:41.738
I have a chronic pain issue
that has been...

13:41.738 --> 13:44.240
"excruciating"
doesn't do it justice.

13:44.240 --> 13:46.242
The worst pain
I've ever endured.

13:46.242 --> 13:48.953
It could end my career,
and surgery's only 50/50.

13:48.953 --> 13:51.956
So I needed
to buy some time

13:51.956 --> 13:54.459
so I could figure out
my options.

13:54.459 --> 13:56.419
And I made
a serious mistake.

13:58.087 --> 14:02.216
So the whole thing just...

14:02.216 --> 14:04.010
got away from me.

14:05.928 --> 14:09.182
So you put everyone's life
on the line.

14:09.182 --> 14:13.311
You put my life on the line
to protect your career?

14:13.311 --> 14:14.812
Do   Do you see
how messed up that is?

14:14.812 --> 14:17.398
Can you even see that?

14:20.526 --> 14:21.611
Whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa.

14:21.611 --> 14:22.737
Where   Where you going
with that?

14:22.737 --> 14:24.197
To take that damn drug test
of yours.

14:24.197 --> 14:25.448
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

14:25.448 --> 14:26.783
You're gonna do that
right here

14:26.783 --> 14:29.744
so I can make sure
you're not switching it out.

14:29.744 --> 14:30.870
Are you serious?

14:30.870 --> 14:32.205
Department regulations.

14:33.873 --> 14:36.667
I have to witness
the donation.

14:40.129 --> 14:41.756
Kids?
Hello?

14:43.132 --> 14:44.675
I think there's
a party area

14:44.675 --> 14:46.052
off to the side
of the arcade here.

14:46.052 --> 14:47.553
You know this place?

14:47.553 --> 14:49.931
Yeah, my dad used to
take me here when I was little.

14:49.931 --> 14:52.475
Oh.
There's a door.

15:05.738 --> 15:07.490
 I got someone.

15:07.490 --> 15:08.741
I'll take her.

15:08.741 --> 15:10.910
Hey.
There's another door.

15:19.043 --> 15:20.711
 Hey, guys.

15:20.711 --> 15:22.713
It's okay.
You don't have to be scared.

15:22.713 --> 15:24.298
We're from
the fire department,

15:24.298 --> 15:25.883
and we're gonna get you
out of here.

15:25.883 --> 15:28.970
I've owned these lanes
for over 50 years.

15:28.970 --> 15:30.388
That is a long time,
Walter.

15:30.388 --> 15:32.974
I already said that,
didn't I?

15:32.974 --> 15:35.601
Incident Commander,
this is Ladder 19.

15:35.601 --> 15:38.396
I am with a trapped patient,
unable to extricate.

15:38.396 --> 15:40.314
I need those hose lines
to protect him.

15:40.314 --> 15:42.191
Ladder 19
from Incident Command.

15:42.191 --> 15:44.402
Roger. I'll get you that
hose line as soon as possible.

15:44.402 --> 15:47.572
These pinsetters weigh
about 1,500 pounds.

15:47.572 --> 15:49.365
I need you to save
your breath, Walter.

15:49.365 --> 15:50.825
And I need you
to go save those kids.

15:50.825 --> 15:52.201
I am with you right now.

15:52.201 --> 15:54.328
My friends,
they are saving those kids.

15:54.328 --> 15:55.997
What's your name, son?

15:55.997 --> 15:58.082
Dean.
Dean Miller.

16:00.126 --> 16:03.045
Dean Miller,
I'm an old man.

16:03.045 --> 16:04.922
Happy man.

16:04.922 --> 16:06.757
It's not that
I did everything right.

16:06.757 --> 16:08.718
I screwed up my son
so bad,

16:08.718 --> 16:12.763
he picked drugs over
his own daughter, but...

16:12.763 --> 16:15.558
but I did the best I could.

16:15.558 --> 16:16.851
Raised her.

16:16.851 --> 16:18.811
Built a place
for my community

16:18.811 --> 16:21.522
where they could
get together.

16:21.522 --> 16:24.901
I had my time, Dean.

16:24.901 --> 16:28.446
Those kids, they haven't
even got started yet.

16:28.446 --> 16:31.490
I'm toast.
We both know it.

16:31.490 --> 16:33.910
You   You go save
those kids.

16:33.910 --> 16:36.162
That's not the way
this works, Walter.

16:36.162 --> 16:37.914
And that is not
the way I work.

16:37.914 --> 16:40.124
There are a lot
of good firefighters,

16:40.124 --> 16:42.043
and they are looking
for those kids.

16:42.043 --> 16:43.669
They're gonna be fine.

16:43.669 --> 16:46.839
You tell Rachel
to forgive her dad.

16:46.839 --> 16:48.591
All that anger,

16:48.591 --> 16:50.551
not good
to carry it around.

16:50.551 --> 16:52.678
I'm not
telling her anything.

16:52.678 --> 16:54.180
Okay, I'm gonna
beat back this fire,

16:54.180 --> 16:57.141
and then you, you're gonna teach
me how to bowl, okay, Walter?

16:57.141 --> 16:58.392
Okay?

16:58.392 --> 17:01.812
Dean,
I'm a terrible bowler.

17:01.812 --> 17:03.397
Never broke 200.

17:03.397 --> 17:06.358
Where's that
damn hose line?

17:06.358 --> 17:07.777
I'm gonna go
get that hose line,

17:07.777 --> 17:09.403
and you're gonna teach me
how to bowl.

17:09.403 --> 17:11.280
You just sit tight,
and you wait for me!

17:11.280 --> 17:13.699
I'm gonna be right back!
I'll be back for you!

17:13.699 --> 17:17.078
You better not,
Dean Miller.

17:17.078 --> 17:19.121
You better not.

17:27.755 --> 17:29.590
I just don't get
how it happened.

17:29.590 --> 17:32.343
We were just
cleaning shoes...

17:32.343 --> 17:35.429
and then
all of a sudden...

17:35.429 --> 17:39.600
I-I don't know.
It sounded like waves, like...

17:39.600 --> 17:41.602
And there was just fire

17:41.602 --> 17:44.897
just pouring out from
where the pinsetters were.

17:44.897 --> 17:46.607
My grandpa...

17:46.607 --> 17:48.609
he always said
those were flammable.

17:53.614 --> 17:55.783
Can you get him out?

17:55.783 --> 17:57.827
You can, right?

17:57.827 --> 17:59.745
Yeah, look, we've, um...
got people in there, okay?

17:59.745 --> 18:01.163
I'm sure they're
getting him out.

18:03.374 --> 18:04.959
Bowling IC from Ladder 19,

18:04.959 --> 18:09.088
we have seven minors in
the arcade, no visible injuries.

18:09.088 --> 18:12.717
Additionally, we have one adult
female that is unconscious.

18:12.717 --> 18:14.260
Commencing evacuation.
Copy that, 19.

18:14.260 --> 18:15.720
-Miller!
-Yeah.

18:15.720 --> 18:17.305
We got to get her
to an aid car.

18:20.683 --> 18:22.143
Hey.
What about the kids?

18:22.143 --> 18:23.978
We're right behind you,
alright?

18:23.978 --> 18:25.187
Okay, kids.

18:25.187 --> 18:26.689
Come out, come out.
There we go.

18:26.689 --> 18:29.483
Anyone that is wearing a
sweatshirt or an extra T-shirt,

18:29.483 --> 18:31.193
I want you to take it off

18:31.193 --> 18:33.612
and I want you to wrap it around
your head like this, okay?

18:33.612 --> 18:36.240
Like a cowboy.
Why are we cowboys?

18:36.240 --> 18:38.868
Because this is the Wild West
and we're on an adventure.

18:38.868 --> 18:41.162
Trevor has asthma.
He needs his inhaler.

18:41.162 --> 18:43.497
Montgomery, I've got a kid
in respiratory distress.

18:43.497 --> 18:45.333
Just cover your face for me,
sweetie.

18:45.333 --> 18:47.543
This one? Hey, little man,
I'm gonna pick you up, okay?

18:47.543 --> 18:49.003
Come on.

18:49.003 --> 18:50.463
-Alright.
-Okay, kids.

18:50.463 --> 18:53.049
I'll go first.
You form a line.

18:53.049 --> 18:56.552
Just follow me, okay?
It's gonna be alright.

18:56.552 --> 18:58.679
That's it.

19:03.768 --> 19:06.020
Okay, kids,
let's head back in, okay?

19:06.020 --> 19:07.271
 Alright, everyone,
get back into the room.

19:07.271 --> 19:08.814
Nice and easy.
Get on the floor.
Head back in, to the back.

19:08.814 --> 19:10.566
As quick as you can, okay?
Get on the floor.

19:10.566 --> 19:12.276
Cover your faces.
As quickly as you can.

19:15.821 --> 19:18.240
Herrera, Gibson, report.

19:20.451 --> 19:22.244
We're okay.
The kids are fine.

19:22.244 --> 19:23.913
But we lost part of the roof,

19:23.913 --> 19:25.831
and the collapse took out
our only exit.

19:41.806 --> 19:43.808
Jack, let's get the kids
away from there.

19:43.808 --> 19:44.850
It's not safe.
We can make an opening.

19:44.850 --> 19:45.893
We can squeeze through.

19:47.186 --> 19:49.021
We can squeeze through.
We can   can get out.

19:49.021 --> 19:51.232
We can  
We have to get out.

19:51.232 --> 19:53.192
We have to get out!

19:53.192 --> 19:55.820
We have to get out!
We have to get out!

19:55.820 --> 19:58.072
Captain, get us out.
We have to get out!

20:18.509 --> 20:20.219
I couldn't save
her grandpa.

20:20.219 --> 20:20.928
I didn't have
enough time.

20:20.928 --> 20:22.513
The last thing he asked me to do
was to save those kids,

20:22.513 --> 20:24.140
so I'm gonna go
save those kids.

20:24.140 --> 20:25.975
Miller, you will wait
for my orders!

20:25.975 --> 20:27.309
Captain, I did
a perimeter sweep.

20:27.309 --> 20:28.602
There's no egress
on the north wall,

20:28.602 --> 20:29.854
and I think that's
where they are.

20:32.273 --> 20:33.732
Bowling IC,
this is Ladder 19.

20:33.732 --> 20:35.651
I have two firefighters
and seven minors

20:35.651 --> 20:37.236
trapped in the arcade.

20:37.236 --> 20:38.946
We are gonna breach the wall.
Roger, 19.

20:38.946 --> 20:40.740
Gibson and Herrera,
I need you to clear the kids

20:40.740 --> 20:42.074
of the north
exterior wall.

20:42.074 --> 20:43.742
All of 19, I want you
on the north wall

20:43.742 --> 20:45.453
with pry bars
and sledgehammers.
Yep.

20:45.453 --> 20:47.121
Someone get me
a battering ram.

20:53.085 --> 20:55.129
Time for my therapy session.

20:56.839 --> 20:59.842
I never went into an incident
under the influence.

20:59.842 --> 21:02.428
You think
that gets you my respect?

21:02.428 --> 21:04.597
Oh, you lost
all my respect.

21:04.597 --> 21:06.891
Not only did you lie
and steal,

21:06.891 --> 21:09.852
but you got a probie caught up
in all your lying and stealing,

21:09.852 --> 21:11.812
a probie who happens to be
the Chief's son.

21:11.812 --> 21:14.190
Well, I didn't expect it
to go down that way, so  

21:14.190 --> 21:16.108
Your excuses
just make it worse.

21:17.401 --> 21:19.153
Okay.

21:19.153 --> 21:20.696
This is what
we're gonna do.

21:20.696 --> 21:22.740
You are gonna go to
the Chief right now,

21:22.740 --> 21:23.991
and you're gonna tell him
the truth  

21:23.991 --> 21:26.285
all of it.

21:26.285 --> 21:28.329
Tell him what, exactly?

21:28.329 --> 21:30.372
Tell him that you are unfit
for this job.

21:30.372 --> 21:31.707
Tell him
that it's your fault

21:31.707 --> 21:33.626
Pruitt Herrera died
up on that roof.

21:33.626 --> 21:35.711
I had a feeling to go into
that storage unit.

21:35.711 --> 21:36.837
You're Battalion Chief!

21:36.837 --> 21:38.339
You don't get
to break rules

21:38.339 --> 21:40.049
just because you have
a feeling!

21:40.049 --> 21:42.301
You abandoned your command,
and you abandoned your team.

21:42.301 --> 21:43.969
I had no other choice.

21:45.721 --> 21:46.889
You could have gone
up on that roof.

21:46.889 --> 21:48.974
The roof was suicide.

21:48.974 --> 21:50.601
Captain Herrera
had cancer  

21:50.601 --> 21:52.686
No, don't you dare make this
about his cancer!

21:52.686 --> 21:54.647
If Pruitt Herrera
had been perfectly healthy,

21:54.647 --> 21:57.483
he still would have
gone up on that roof.

21:57.483 --> 22:00.569
It never once occurred to you
to climb up there and do that.

22:00.569 --> 22:03.364
I have to stay alive
for my wife,

22:03.364 --> 22:05.574
who has lost enough
this year

22:05.574 --> 22:07.743
and who was going to lose
her father soon,

22:07.743 --> 22:10.120
with or without the fire.

22:10.120 --> 22:11.372
Your what?

22:13.666 --> 22:16.961
Andy and I got married
a couple weeks ago.

22:16.961 --> 22:19.004
Her father walked her
down the aisle.

22:19.004 --> 22:20.506
He blessed it.

22:20.506 --> 22:23.634
He shook my hand.

22:23.634 --> 22:27.221
Warren, I had to go in there
to save my wife.

22:27.221 --> 22:28.973
And I had to stay alive.

22:33.852 --> 22:36.272
Herrera, is the north exterior
wall clear of civilians?

22:36.272 --> 22:37.690
We're getting through.

22:37.690 --> 22:39.692
 Affirmative,
but there are arcade games.

22:39.692 --> 22:41.819
Well, you're gonna
need to move those.

22:41.819 --> 22:44.196
It's a cavity wall.
There's a second layer.

22:44.196 --> 22:47.408
Yeah?
Then we swing harder.

22:47.408 --> 22:49.702
Look, I know
it's a little scary in here,

22:49.702 --> 22:50.995
but we're gonna
get you out, okay?

22:50.995 --> 22:52.329
Son of a...

22:52.329 --> 22:53.414
Alright, you know what?

22:53.414 --> 22:54.999
Kids, why don't we, uh,
cluster together?

22:54.999 --> 22:56.584
Damn it!
Get close.

22:56.584 --> 22:58.460
Let's hug each other.
Big group hug.

22:58.460 --> 22:59.753
That's it.
Son of a...

22:59.753 --> 23:02.089
You know what?
Hugs help our bodies calm down.

23:02.089 --> 23:04.800
That's it. Hang tight here.
I'll be right back.

23:04.800 --> 23:07.845
Jack, you're panicking.
You're scaring the kids.

23:07.845 --> 23:09.680
Our team is out there
pulling down the wall.

23:09.680 --> 23:11.473
We have to let them.
That's what I'm trying to do.

23:11.473 --> 23:12.891
Help me.

23:12.891 --> 23:14.685
Just help me!

23:16.645 --> 23:18.314
There. There.
Now they can get through to us.

23:18.314 --> 23:19.773
Let's get back
to the kids.

23:19.773 --> 23:20.816
We have to get out.
Okay, Jack  

23:20.816 --> 23:22.276
-We have to get out!
-Okay, look at me, look at me!

23:22.276 --> 23:23.527
Stop! Stop!
You were right!
You were right!

23:23.527 --> 23:25.237
It might have been a mistake
to marry Sullivan.

23:29.033 --> 23:30.284
Come on.

23:30.284 --> 23:32.119
It seemed like
a good idea.

23:32.119 --> 23:33.954
I was mostly thinking
about my dad

23:33.954 --> 23:35.873
walking me down the aisle
before he died,

23:35.873 --> 23:37.625
and Diane got inside my head

23:37.625 --> 23:40.169
about how I was trying
to replace my father,

23:40.169 --> 23:42.087
and I was trying
to prove her wrong

23:42.087 --> 23:44.214
but somehow ended up
proving her right.

23:44.214 --> 23:46.342
Kids, how are we doing?

23:46.342 --> 23:47.926
Can we sing
while we hug?

23:47.926 --> 23:49.261
Yes, you can.

23:49.261 --> 23:52.097
That is an excellent idea.

24:15.120 --> 24:16.872
You kinda should be.

24:23.545 --> 24:24.963
Alright.
We got through.

24:24.963 --> 24:26.882
Get the battering ram
in here.
Alright.

24:27.925 --> 24:30.511
Ready?
Yeah.

24:30.511 --> 24:33.764
Alright.
One, two, three.

24:48.404 --> 24:50.280
That's beautiful, kids.

24:50.280 --> 24:53.158
One more verse,
and we'll have you out of here.

24:53.158 --> 24:55.077
Put some muscle into it, 19!
Let's go! Let's go!

24:58.539 --> 25:00.791
Hey, um...

25:00.791 --> 25:03.127
Pruitt.

25:03.127 --> 25:05.337
Um...

25:05.337 --> 25:07.548
I'm sorry
about Ryan.

25:07.548 --> 25:09.967
I know you two
were close.

25:11.635 --> 25:14.179
Yeah, he was...

25:14.179 --> 25:16.390
he was a good kid,
good cop.

25:19.643 --> 25:21.270
You know, when I first
started this job,

25:21.270 --> 25:22.896
I was afraid I'd go numb.

25:22.896 --> 25:24.690
I knew a lot of guys,
old-timers,

25:24.690 --> 25:26.817
that had seen such
horrific things on the job

25:26.817 --> 25:28.569
that they didn't even
take it in anymore.

25:28.569 --> 25:32.406
They'd see a body
in the street and...

25:32.406 --> 25:35.784
they'd see it as debris
that needed to be cleared.

25:35.784 --> 25:37.494
But when I saw Ryan
lying there...

25:40.497 --> 25:41.915
So at least
I haven't gone numb.

25:43.500 --> 25:44.960
Like, ever?

25:44.960 --> 25:47.838
Like, you want to
feel it all?

25:47.838 --> 25:50.048
I-I feel like my goal
is to go numb sometimes.

25:50.048 --> 25:51.592
Once.

25:51.592 --> 25:52.551
One time.

25:54.636 --> 25:57.347
Was so bad,
I couldn't feel it.

25:57.347 --> 25:59.183
It was the first year
that I was Lieutenant.

25:59.183 --> 26:00.642
Middle of the night,
got called out

26:00.642 --> 26:03.061
to a nasty
drunk-driving accident.

26:03.061 --> 26:04.772
Whole family of five gone

26:04.772 --> 26:07.775
because one drunk kid
couldn't call a cab.

26:07.775 --> 26:10.652
Damn.
Yeah, I found out later
that the kid was pulled over

26:10.652 --> 26:13.238
earlier in the night
by a cop I knew.

26:13.238 --> 26:14.656
Blew a .12.

26:14.656 --> 26:16.658
What?

26:16.658 --> 26:19.453
Cop let him go.

26:19.453 --> 26:20.746
Told him
to go right home.

26:20.746 --> 26:22.706
Why?

26:22.706 --> 26:25.626
Kid was the mayor's son.

26:25.626 --> 26:28.212
The cop wanted the mayor
to owe him one.

26:28.212 --> 26:30.714
Kid did one night in jail
and then walked.

26:30.714 --> 26:32.466
I will never forget that.

26:32.466 --> 26:35.427
I-I was numb for days.

26:37.846 --> 26:41.099
Then the whole thing washed over
me, and all I felt was rage.

26:41.099 --> 26:42.684
Yeah.

26:42.684 --> 26:44.895
Where   Where's
that cop now?

26:47.397 --> 26:49.399
He cashed in that favor.

26:55.572 --> 26:58.367
You know, you're not exactly
a rule follower.

27:01.286 --> 27:03.705
There are three kinds
of people.

27:03.705 --> 27:07.876
One, people who follow
the rules no matter what.

27:07.876 --> 27:10.921
Two, people who break the rules
to save the lives of others.

27:10.921 --> 27:13.632
Three, people who break
the rules to save themselves.

27:13.632 --> 27:15.217
Now, me,
I'm the kind of guy

27:15.217 --> 27:16.969
who drives a car
in a breakdown lane

27:16.969 --> 27:20.305
because I have someone dying
in the back seat.

27:20.305 --> 27:21.849
You drive
in the breakdown lane

27:21.849 --> 27:23.642
just because you happen
to be running late for work.

27:35.153 --> 27:37.239
Clean, right?

27:37.239 --> 27:38.574
It's clean.
Mm-hmm.

27:38.574 --> 27:41.410
Alright,
we're done here.

27:41.410 --> 27:43.996
No.
We are not done.

27:43.996 --> 27:45.956
Let me be very clear  

27:45.956 --> 27:49.167
You have no idea
what I survived in my life.

27:49.167 --> 27:52.296
I don't give a rat's ass
what you survived.

27:52.296 --> 27:53.547
We've all survived plenty.

27:53.547 --> 27:55.257
Surviving is
what is expected of us.

27:55.257 --> 27:58.594
But what kind of man
did life make you?

27:58.594 --> 27:59.887
You want me to believe

27:59.887 --> 28:02.556
that you're the man
you think you are?

28:02.556 --> 28:05.392
It's easy.
Just do the right thing.

28:07.603 --> 28:10.147
But you better do it
before I do it for you.

28:14.318 --> 28:15.986
Um, hi.
Hello.

28:15.986 --> 28:16.862
Are you in charge?

28:16.862 --> 28:18.155
Oh, no.

28:18.155 --> 28:19.781
I'm just helping
my daughter organize.

28:19.781 --> 28:21.325
She's the Captain.

28:21.325 --> 28:23.076
Ah. Bishop.

28:23.076 --> 28:24.578
Yeah,
she's a powerhouse.

28:24.578 --> 28:26.330
Thank you.
And you are?

28:26.330 --> 28:27.873
Dr. Miranda Bailey.

28:27.873 --> 28:30.459
I-I actually just came by
to drop this off.

28:30.459 --> 28:32.419
We passed it around
at the hospital,

28:32.419 --> 28:34.463
and there's a good chunk
of change in here,

28:34.463 --> 28:35.839
and I didn't want to risk

28:35.839 --> 28:38.008
one of my interns
having sticky fingers.

28:38.008 --> 28:39.718
How wonderful.
Yeah.

28:39.718 --> 28:41.386
So, they  
are they out on a call?

28:41.386 --> 28:42.763
Yes.
Bowling alley fire.

28:42.763 --> 28:44.932
 Actually, sir, no.

28:44.932 --> 28:48.101
But those two have been
yelling up there all day.

28:48.101 --> 28:49.353
It shatters my nerves.

28:49.353 --> 28:51.521
That's why
I just have to keep busy.

28:51.521 --> 28:53.398
What are they
yelling about?
I'm not sure,

28:53.398 --> 28:56.360
but they each seem very
convinced that they are right.

28:56.360 --> 28:58.236
 You keep forgetting
who's in charge here.

28:58.236 --> 28:59.863
You know, just once, I would
like the truth out of you.

29:01.156 --> 29:03.659
Um, sorry to interrupt.

29:03.659 --> 29:05.994
No problem, Dr. Bailey.
I was just on my way out.

29:09.122 --> 29:10.457
You alright?

29:10.457 --> 29:11.833
Oh, I'm more than alright.
I'm righteous.

29:11.833 --> 29:13.669
But I gotta go.
D  Wait? Where?

29:13.669 --> 29:15.003
I don't trust him as far
as I can kick him.

29:15.003 --> 29:16.546
Hey, you gonna bring the boys
for spaghetti dinner?

29:16.546 --> 29:17.798
Um, any reason
not to have to cook.

29:17.798 --> 29:21.802
Hey, proud of you,
Ben Warren!

29:26.139 --> 29:27.683
Alright, stand down.

29:27.683 --> 29:29.267
I think we can start
to let the kids through.

29:35.607 --> 29:37.651
Who wants to be brave?

29:40.988 --> 29:42.030
This hole right here.

29:42.030 --> 29:43.532
 You ready?
Stick your arms out.

29:43.532 --> 29:44.992
Alright.
Alright.

29:44.992 --> 29:46.910
One at a time.

29:46.910 --> 29:48.203
-You ready?
-Careful, careful,
careful, careful.

29:48.203 --> 29:50.080
Got her.
That was fun.

29:50.080 --> 29:51.707
Yeah? Okay, good.

29:58.755 --> 30:01.550
Okay. All civilian
minors cleared.

30:01.550 --> 30:03.010
Alright. You first.

30:03.010 --> 30:04.678
I can't get through.
It's not big enough.

30:06.555 --> 30:07.973
You go first.

30:07.973 --> 30:11.977
Jack...
we leave together.

30:11.977 --> 30:13.687
It's okay.

30:13.687 --> 30:14.855
They're gonna
get us out.

30:18.859 --> 30:20.068
My grandpa?

30:20.068 --> 30:21.319
Miss, I need you
to step back.
Where is he?

30:21.319 --> 30:22.779
Did you get him out?
Where is my grandpa?

30:22.779 --> 30:25.657
Did you leave him in there?
Miss, step back!

30:27.034 --> 30:28.493
Miller, no stopping.

30:28.493 --> 30:29.619
There are living people
in there.

30:29.619 --> 30:31.663
Captain!

30:31.663 --> 30:33.040
Eyes forward!

30:42.966 --> 30:44.217
We're coming out!

30:53.268 --> 30:54.269
Thanks.
Anytime.

31:02.986 --> 31:04.154
You good, Gibson?

31:04.154 --> 31:05.906
Yeah. Yeah.

31:13.538 --> 31:15.874
Rachel.

31:15.874 --> 31:17.876
My name
is Dean Miller.

31:17.876 --> 31:20.462
Your grandpa asked me
to tell you some things.

31:20.462 --> 31:22.672
I was with him
when he died,

31:22.672 --> 31:25.509
and he asked me to tell you
to forgive your dad.

31:26.760 --> 31:29.554
He said forgive him.

31:29.554 --> 31:34.392
And he told me
to save those kids.

31:34.392 --> 31:37.312
Search and
Rescue 19, this is Bowling IC.

31:37.312 --> 31:38.855
We've contained the fire.

31:38.855 --> 31:40.607
Roger.
We've completed extrication

31:40.607 --> 31:42.234
of the children
and firefighters.

31:54.412 --> 31:57.415
I'm telling the Captain
to bench you.

31:57.415 --> 31:58.500
What?

31:58.500 --> 31:59.501
For what?

31:59.501 --> 32:01.044
You lost control today.

32:01.044 --> 32:03.463
I was doing my job.
Poorly.

32:03.463 --> 32:04.714
You scared the hell
out of those kids,

32:04.714 --> 32:06.091
and you scared
the hell out of me.

32:06.091 --> 32:07.300
If you're getting scared,

32:07.300 --> 32:10.345
maybe you're the one
that needs to be benched.

32:10.345 --> 32:12.222
You have PTSD.

32:12.222 --> 32:13.890
It's a diagnosis.

32:13.890 --> 32:16.059
You're triggered right now,
and   and that's okay.

32:16.059 --> 32:17.352
It's not your fault.

32:17.352 --> 32:22.107
But it does impair your ability
to do this job.

32:22.107 --> 32:24.025
I've buried a lot of people
I love this year,

32:24.025 --> 32:26.444
and I am not about to add you
to the list.

32:26.444 --> 32:28.488
I am  
I am getting help.

32:28.488 --> 32:30.991
Don't lie to me.
I'm not.

32:30.991 --> 32:33.827
I-I've been seeing Diane
about some stuff,

32:33.827 --> 32:35.328
and   and it's helped.

32:35.328 --> 32:38.498
I'll talk to her
about the PTSD.

32:38.498 --> 32:42.878
What "stuff" have you
been seeing Diane about?

32:42.878 --> 32:45.714
Sex stuff.

32:45.714 --> 32:48.133
Love stuff.

32:48.133 --> 32:50.510
Are you talking about me?

32:52.470 --> 32:54.264
Kind of.

32:54.264 --> 32:58.351
How I only seem to want women
who can't love me back.

33:00.770 --> 33:02.397
It's only funny
'cause it's true.

33:06.276 --> 33:08.945
Hey, did you only say all
that stuff about being scared

33:08.945 --> 33:11.698
to calm me down?

33:11.698 --> 33:14.159
Yes and no.
I don't know.

33:16.828 --> 33:18.288
I'm a mess.

33:21.333 --> 33:22.459
You know who
you should talk to?

33:22.459 --> 33:25.128
Don't say Diane.

33:25.128 --> 33:26.630
Your husband.

33:31.343 --> 33:32.385
-Uh, sir.

33:32.385 --> 33:33.845
Sir. Um, sir.

33:34.804 --> 33:36.306
I need
to speak with you.

33:36.306 --> 33:40.060
Please tell me this is not about
this Line of Duty funeral.

33:40.060 --> 33:41.686
You know what? Fine.
Approved.

33:41.686 --> 33:42.854
I'm tired
of talking about it.

33:42.854 --> 33:44.773
Uh, uh, no, sir.
Oh, but thank you, sir.

33:44.773 --> 33:45.982
That  
That's great news.

33:45.982 --> 33:49.611
Chief, I need to discuss
my behavior.

33:49.611 --> 33:51.571
Now? I'm literally
walking to my car.

33:51.571 --> 33:52.405
We're married.

33:53.531 --> 33:54.824
You two?

33:54.824 --> 33:58.078
Uh...Herrera and I.

33:58.078 --> 33:59.663
Okay. And?

33:59.663 --> 34:01.498
Well, we should
be talking about

34:01.498 --> 34:02.874
whether or not
I transfer stations.

34:02.874 --> 34:04.584
You know what?
You're a smart guy.

34:04.584 --> 34:05.919
I'm sure
you'll figure it out.

34:05.919 --> 34:06.878
Anything else?

34:08.088 --> 34:09.880
Yes, sir.

34:09.880 --> 34:14.678
I need to
report myself.

34:14.678 --> 34:16.804
I stole drugs.

34:16.804 --> 34:18.806
OD'd.

34:18.806 --> 34:20.641
On the job.

34:26.690 --> 34:28.984
You haven't? No.
I love that.

34:28.984 --> 34:30.318
What is this?
Thank you so much.
Yeah, it's so easy.

34:30.318 --> 34:32.070
Hey.
Oh, hi.

34:32.070 --> 34:34.364
I-I know you needed help
getting ready

34:34.364 --> 34:36.157
for your spaghetti dinner,
so we helped.

34:36.157 --> 34:37.033
I didn't ask you
to do that.

34:37.033 --> 34:38.702
I know.

34:38.702 --> 34:40.911
Maya, we were just trying
to make it easier for y 

34:40.911 --> 34:42.289
Mom.

34:42.289 --> 34:44.123
T-minus two hours
until doors open.

34:44.123 --> 34:45.250
Chop-chop, people.
Oh, wait.

34:45.250 --> 34:46.918
Who's on garlic duty?
Not it. N-Not it.

34:46.918 --> 34:48.460
Someone's
got to do it!

34:48.460 --> 34:50.088
 Probie,
you're on garlic duty.

34:50.088 --> 34:51.840
But I just did  
Probie.

34:51.840 --> 34:53.632
Garlic or suspension  
your choice.

34:54.926 --> 34:56.386
Yeah. Okay.

34:56.386 --> 34:57.804
Uh, yeah, I-I like garlic.

34:59.889 --> 35:01.766
Mom, thank you,

35:01.766 --> 35:03.810
but you can't just show up
at my work and take over.

35:03.810 --> 35:05.103
I didn't think  

35:05.103 --> 35:08.231
Dad never
laid a hand on us.

35:08.231 --> 35:09.899
He didn't have to.

35:11.735 --> 35:14.070
His rage.
His moods.

35:14.070 --> 35:15.905
Yeah, he was tough.

35:15.905 --> 35:17.907
He could be a jerk.
He could be mean.

35:17.907 --> 35:20.368
But that doesn't mean
he abused us.

35:22.537 --> 35:25.874
Tough is grounding you
for breaking curfew.

35:25.874 --> 35:29.210
Abuse is making you walk home
20 miles from your track meet

35:29.210 --> 35:31.504
for coming in second.

35:31.504 --> 35:34.674
I came in first,
actually.

35:34.674 --> 35:36.676
But I didn't beat
my own time.

35:38.428 --> 35:39.721
Maya.

35:39.721 --> 35:42.891
Come with me to
my next therapy session.

35:42.891 --> 35:44.893
I beat it
the next time.

35:47.270 --> 35:50.899
You know, I agree.
You need therapy.

35:50.899 --> 35:52.442
But I'm good.

35:58.948 --> 36:00.742
If you acted alone,
why's Warren here?

36:02.535 --> 36:04.621
Uh, to hold me
accountable.

36:08.208 --> 36:10.085
You understand
how this works, right?

36:13.546 --> 36:15.799
Maybe you're not as smart
as I thought.

36:15.799 --> 36:20.595
If nobody knows,
it never happened.

36:20.595 --> 36:22.680
You tell no one else,
you keep your job.

36:22.680 --> 36:25.266
You keep your title.
Bishop keeps her title.

36:25.266 --> 36:26.559
Herrera keeps her job.

36:26.559 --> 36:28.895
Warren keeps his job.
The PRT keeps running.

36:28.895 --> 36:30.605
God knows I don't need
a drug scandal

36:30.605 --> 36:31.898
in my first year as Chief.

36:31.898 --> 36:33.024
I'm sure you don't, either.

36:33.024 --> 36:35.193
Sir, there are rules.

36:35.193 --> 36:37.112
Consequences.
-Yeah.

36:37.112 --> 36:39.489
I'm sure you're really worried
about the rules, Bob.

36:39.489 --> 36:42.075
It was you.

36:42.075 --> 36:44.619
Excuse me?

36:44.619 --> 36:47.956
Pruitt Herrera
told me a story.

36:47.956 --> 36:50.208
You're the cop
who cashed in the favor.

36:53.545 --> 36:55.505
You want your little
drug ring exposed?

36:55.505 --> 36:57.006
I'm sorry.
Drug ring?

36:57.006 --> 36:59.008
If Robert stole fentanyl
from 19,

36:59.008 --> 37:00.677
then someone had to sign off
on those inventory reports.

37:02.095 --> 37:05.432
The fact that you're here
tells me you're that someone,

37:05.432 --> 37:06.850
and if that comes to light,

37:06.850 --> 37:09.102
I may have to turn this
whole mess over to the feds,

37:09.102 --> 37:11.479
which means
both you and your wife

37:11.479 --> 37:13.815
may be facing
serious prison time.
No, no, no, no. No, no.

37:13.815 --> 37:15.108
My wife has nothing
to do with this!

37:15.108 --> 37:17.068
-I don't see it that way!
-Sir, you do not  

37:17.068 --> 37:20.530
The PRT is a joint operation
with your wife's hospital.

37:20.530 --> 37:22.866
It's nothing  
If you don't think
she'll get dragged into this,

37:22.866 --> 37:24.868
you don't know the first thing
about politics.

37:26.119 --> 37:28.997
You should stick to running
into burning buildings.

37:28.997 --> 37:32.709
It's a lot safer
than ticking me off.

37:36.629 --> 37:38.965
Congratulations
on your marriage.

37:47.015 --> 37:49.809
And Sullivan?

37:49.809 --> 37:52.395
You owe me.

37:52.395 --> 37:54.147
I won't forget that.

38:03.072 --> 38:04.699
It's good to see you,
Mrs. Bradley.

38:04.699 --> 38:06.326
I'm glad to see that you don't
have your neck brace on.

38:06.326 --> 38:07.577
Oh, you have no idea.

38:07.577 --> 38:09.370
That thing was worse
than a chastity belt.

38:11.664 --> 38:13.708
Speaking of
chastity belts,

38:13.708 --> 38:16.252
uh, explain to me
how this is fair.

38:16.252 --> 38:18.463
I had to take my shirt off
for this thing.
Right.

38:18.463 --> 38:21.216
And you are covered
head to toe.

38:21.216 --> 38:22.801
In purple spandex.

38:22.801 --> 38:23.760
So...

38:23.760 --> 38:24.928
Yeah.
It's not  

38:24.928 --> 38:26.387
It's just really tight.

38:26.387 --> 38:28.598
It looks  
It's, like, super tight.

38:28.598 --> 38:29.807
Would you like
some bread?

38:29.807 --> 38:31.392
Which is   Right? It's  
What's the problem?

38:31.392 --> 38:33.812
Mmm.
Okay, slow down,

38:33.812 --> 38:36.022
or these people will think
I don't feed you at home.

38:36.022 --> 38:37.524
Mmm.
I want to go down
that pole.

38:37.524 --> 38:38.942
Ben won't let us.

38:38.942 --> 38:41.194
Then maybe we shouldn't ask him.

38:41.194 --> 38:44.072
Uh, you do ask him,
and he does say no.

38:45.490 --> 38:48.117
Hey, uh,
can we go get seconds?

38:48.117 --> 38:49.536
Yeah, go on.

38:49.536 --> 38:50.578
Wha 

38:50.578 --> 38:51.871
They're  
They're fine.

38:51.871 --> 38:52.914
Um...

38:54.749 --> 38:56.209
Alright, what happened
with Sullivan?

38:58.419 --> 39:01.881
We went to Dixon.
Told him everything.

39:01.881 --> 39:03.383
And nothing.

39:03.383 --> 39:05.593
He just sweeps it
under the rug.

39:09.055 --> 39:10.848
I'm a good person.

39:10.848 --> 39:11.975
A good man.

39:11.975 --> 39:13.268
The best.
Okay.

39:13.268 --> 39:15.478
But I let myself
forget that lately,

39:15.478 --> 39:18.273
in service
of the greater good.

39:18.273 --> 39:19.691
You know, Pruitt Herrera,

39:19.691 --> 39:21.109
you could say a lot of things
about him,

39:21.109 --> 39:24.654
but one thing he never did is
compromise his values.

39:24.654 --> 39:26.573
He was good
through and through.

39:26.573 --> 39:32.120
I-I need to honor that...
the best way I know how.

39:33.538 --> 39:35.164
I'm gonna take down
Fire Chief Dixon.

39:44.173 --> 39:47.719
I, too,
love my dad very much.

39:47.719 --> 39:50.054
He's   He's brilliant.
He's   He's funny.

39:50.054 --> 39:51.389
He's...

39:51.389 --> 39:55.852
He's my hero,
in so many ways.

39:55.852 --> 39:58.313
But that's why
it took me so long

39:58.313 --> 40:01.024
to realize
that he wasn't okay.

40:01.024 --> 40:04.360
It took me so long to realize
that   that it isn't normal

40:04.360 --> 40:06.738
to live your life
on eggshells.

40:06.738 --> 40:08.072
Maya.

40:10.283 --> 40:12.702
Denial is a strong force,

40:12.702 --> 40:15.079
a-a-and the abuse your mom
described outside

40:15.079 --> 40:16.497
is still abuse  

40:16.497 --> 40:18.708
I'm not in denial.

40:18.708 --> 40:21.628
I won a gold medal
because of my dad.

40:21.628 --> 40:24.505
I am the youngest Fire Captain
in Seattle

40:24.505 --> 40:27.425
and this station's first female
Captain because of my dad.

40:27.425 --> 40:28.843
I am not in denial.

40:28.843 --> 40:31.596
I am pissed.

40:49.280 --> 40:51.282
Dixon knows.

40:52.408 --> 40:53.493
Knows what?

40:53.493 --> 40:55.536
Everything.
You, me, us.

40:55.536 --> 40:57.580
The drugs.

40:57.580 --> 41:00.333
He knows.
It's all over.

41:00.333 --> 41:02.251
No one loses their job.

41:02.251 --> 41:05.046
Are you serious?

41:05.046 --> 41:08.091
And he also approved your
father's Line of Duty funeral.

41:08.091 --> 41:10.093
Oh, my God, Robert.

41:10.093 --> 41:11.469
That's amazing.

41:13.513 --> 41:15.765
Listen, I want to be able
to kiss my wife in public.

41:15.765 --> 41:17.850
We're not in public.
We're at work.

41:17.850 --> 41:20.561
Well, I want
to let them know.

41:20.561 --> 41:21.896
What?
Mm-hmm.

41:21.896 --> 41:23.064
No.
I-It's not the time  

41:23.064 --> 41:24.857
Everybody!

41:24.857 --> 41:29.987
I-I just want to let you know
that, uh, thanks to you, we won.

41:29.987 --> 41:31.781
We, uh, got the funding

41:31.781 --> 41:34.367
for Captain Herrera's
Line of Duty funeral.

41:34.367 --> 41:36.619
Yes! Yes!

41:39.205 --> 41:42.625
And, um...one more announcement
while I have you here.

41:42.625 --> 41:44.419
Come on.
Don't be scared.

41:44.419 --> 41:48.548
I would like to say
publicly

41:48.548 --> 41:52.593
that I love this woman.

41:52.593 --> 41:55.221
And I love her so much

41:55.221 --> 41:56.931
that I married her.

41:56.931 --> 42:01.102
So this is sort of
our wedding reception.

42:08.359 --> 42:10.403
-Yeah!
-Whoo!
