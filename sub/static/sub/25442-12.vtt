Whoo-hoo!

00:09.250 --> 00:12.960
"Peasant Woman with Fruit" is
gonna be my best painting ever.

00:12.960 --> 00:16.250
What? I thought you said
"Pleasant Woman with Fruit".

00:16.250 --> 00:18.540
Why have I been smiling
this whole time?

00:20.250 --> 00:23.620
Anyway, this painting
is definitely gonna get me

00:23.620 --> 00:26.250
my private beach in Jamaica.

00:26.250 --> 00:27.670
(clarinet blaring)

00:27.670 --> 00:30.250
Oh, no!

00:31.330 --> 00:33.460
My bad, Auntie Rae.

00:33.460 --> 00:35.120
I'm trying out
different instruments

00:35.120 --> 00:36.670
to see if I'm
musically inclined.

00:36.670 --> 00:39.250
Well, I'm inclined
to say that you're not.

00:40.750 --> 00:43.120
It's okay, sweetie.
Here. Have a pear.

00:43.120 --> 00:44.380
Chels, that's plastic.

00:44.380 --> 00:46.380
Okay, well, I didn't
tell him to eat it.

00:48.920 --> 00:50.960
Mom, how does
this sound?

00:52.330 --> 00:54.250
"This has been
Nia Baxter-Carter.

00:54.250 --> 00:58.170
And remember, you can't spell
community without unity."

00:58.170 --> 01:00.710
That was amazing Nia!
-Right?

01:00.710 --> 01:01.670
Hey, how does this sound?

01:01.670 --> 01:05.290
"This is your mother asking
what are you talking about?"

01:06.620 --> 01:07.880
Ms. Pittman's
holding auditions

01:07.880 --> 01:09.210
for the morning
announcements today.

01:09.210 --> 01:11.250
And I'm trying out
for the commentary segment.

01:11.250 --> 01:12.330
And I'm going to nail it

01:12.330 --> 01:14.420
because no one is as unique
as Nia Baxter-Carter.

01:14.420 --> 01:15.210
-You right.
-Yeah.

01:16.250 --> 01:17.620
Both:
Seriously?

01:18.620 --> 01:20.580
I love it when
my little twinsies
dress alike.

01:20.580 --> 01:22.330
-It's so cute.
-Not cute, Mom.

01:22.330 --> 01:23.500
Booker, you need to change.

01:23.500 --> 01:25.540
Uh, me? You change.

01:25.540 --> 01:27.460
I'm trying out for the
morning announcements today.

01:27.460 --> 01:28.790
Why are you trying out?

01:28.790 --> 01:31.960
I want to make a difference
in this world and go into
broadcasting.

01:31.960 --> 01:32.960
Just like Dad.

01:32.960 --> 01:35.000
Well, I want to do it
for the fame and fortune.

01:35.000 --> 01:36.000
Just like Dad.
-Hold up now.

01:36.000 --> 01:38.120
Wait a second,
don't get it twisted.

01:38.120 --> 01:39.670
Your daddy, he might have
a little fame

01:39.670 --> 01:41.420
but he has no fortune, honey.

01:43.040 --> 01:44.210
Booker, go change your shirt.

01:44.210 --> 01:45.420
You change yours.

01:45.420 --> 01:46.880
How about you both change?

01:48.380 --> 01:49.420
Both:
Deal.

01:49.670 --> 01:51.710
Are you kidding me?

01:51.710 --> 01:53.420
Awkward.

01:53.420 --> 01:55.790
Or adorable.

01:55.790 --> 01:58.620
I think you two should host
the morning announcements
together.

01:58.620 --> 02:03.250
We'll call it
The Carver Corner Commentary

02:03.250 --> 02:05.290

Yeah, a nightmare for me.

You don't own "nightmare."

(both grumble)

Booker. Booker?

03:31.080 --> 03:32.080
Booker?

03:32.540 --> 03:33.380
Booker!

03:34.040 --> 03:37.080
Nothing to see here.
Just a mannequin challenge.

03:37.080 --> 03:38.290
Challenge accepted.

03:48.290 --> 03:49.710
Are you okay?
What happened?

03:49.710 --> 03:51.380
I don't know.

03:51.380 --> 03:52.830
It was really weird.

03:53.920 --> 03:56.040
I had a vision but it froze.

03:56.040 --> 03:57.170
What'd you see?

03:57.170 --> 03:58.670
You were floating in midair.

03:58.670 --> 04:01.290
Floating? How'd it end?

04:01.290 --> 04:02.500
Do I fall? Do I get hurt?

04:02.500 --> 04:05.380
I don't know.
The vision froze.

04:05.380 --> 04:07.210
Well, you can't just tell
a guy he's floating

04:07.210 --> 04:08.670
and leave him hanging.

04:08.670 --> 04:11.000
How did this become
your problem?

04:11.000 --> 04:13.250
I'm the one who just had
a frozen vision.

04:13.250 --> 04:15.290
You're right. Sorry.

04:15.290 --> 04:17.620
I'm just the one
who's life is on the line.

04:17.620 --> 04:21.000
But sure, let's make this
all about you.

04:25.420 --> 04:27.080
Welcome to your Scut ride.

04:27.080 --> 04:28.080
I'm your Scut--

04:28.080 --> 04:30.170
Yes, I know who you are, Raven.

04:30.170 --> 04:32.000
Dr. Sleevemore!

04:32.000 --> 04:32.920
Hello, my dear.

04:32.920 --> 04:34.920
I haven't seen you
since you were a teenager.

04:34.920 --> 04:36.120
You look marvelous.

04:36.120 --> 04:38.290
Oh, well thank you.
And that's just
the back of my head.

04:38.290 --> 04:39.250
It gets better.

04:39.250 --> 04:40.580
(laughing)

04:40.580 --> 04:42.290
You haven't changed a bit.

04:42.290 --> 04:43.210
(giggling)

04:43.210 --> 04:46.580
So, what brings you
to Chicago?

04:46.580 --> 04:50.380
Well, we've just opened a new
Sleevemore Center
for Psychically Gifted Children.

04:50.380 --> 04:53.290
Like the one you attended
in San Francisco
back in the day.

04:53.290 --> 04:55.210
Oh, but far more advanced.

04:55.210 --> 04:56.580
Oh, oh! Hey, hey!

04:56.580 --> 04:58.040
Do you still have
that helmet thingy

04:58.040 --> 05:00.000
that recorded
my psychic abilities?

05:00.000 --> 05:02.120
The Sleevemore
Cerebral Oscillator?

05:02.120 --> 05:03.120
Of course!

05:03.120 --> 05:04.210
Yes! Oh, hey, hey!

05:04.210 --> 05:07.540
Do you still have
that shiny thingy that recorded
psychic events?

05:07.540 --> 05:09.290
The Sleeveometer? Certainly.

05:09.290 --> 05:14.710
(giggles) Well then,
what makes this new place
more advanced?

05:16.250 --> 05:18.830
The deep dish pizza place
on the corner. It's delicious.

05:25.540 --> 05:29.080
Oh, Chels. I think I'm better
at sculpting than I am
at painting.

05:29.080 --> 05:31.210
This is definitely gonna get me
my private beach in Jamaica.

05:31.210 --> 05:32.210
(trombone blares)

05:32.210 --> 05:34.750
No!

05:36.380 --> 05:37.750
My bad, Auntie Rae.

05:37.750 --> 05:39.210
It's okay, honey.
It's not your fault.

05:39.210 --> 05:41.750
Yes it--Yes it--Chels!
Yes it is!

05:41.750 --> 05:43.210
It is literally his fault.

05:44.380 --> 05:45.540
Both:
Whatever!

05:46.170 --> 05:48.120
And now what are
you two arguing about?

05:48.120 --> 05:51.040
Ms. Pittman chose us both
to host The Carver
Corner Commentary.

05:51.040 --> 05:52.210
Because we're twins.

05:52.210 --> 05:53.790
Oh, that's so cute!

05:53.790 --> 05:55.580
Both:
Not cute.

05:55.580 --> 05:57.710
Stop being like me!

05:57.710 --> 06:00.210
I don't understand
what you two are fighting about.

06:00.210 --> 06:02.830
Honestly, this is the most
you've ever been in sync.

06:03.290 --> 06:06.000
Both:
That's what
we're fighting about.

06:07.540 --> 06:10.540
Well, I think you guys
are lucky to be like each other.

06:10.540 --> 06:12.710
But we're not.
We're individuals.

06:12.710 --> 06:15.170
Yeah, we're different people
with different ideas.

06:15.170 --> 06:17.920
Well, then you should respect
each other's ideas.

06:17.920 --> 06:19.000
Okay?

06:19.000 --> 06:20.620
All right now,
what do you want for dinner?

06:20.620 --> 06:22.040
Spanakopita!

06:24.210 --> 06:25.620
Not you, Venus de Milo.

06:26.920 --> 06:28.040
The kids.

06:28.040 --> 06:29.380
What do you want?

06:29.380 --> 06:30.290
Both:
Pizza.

06:31.000 --> 06:33.620
Pork chops with string beans
and apple sauce!

06:33.620 --> 06:35.380
Spanakopita!

06:35.380 --> 06:38.290
You don't even know
what Spanakopita is!

06:42.830 --> 06:44.620
Booker, don't just stand there--

06:49.420 --> 06:50.420
Booker?

06:52.210 --> 06:53.250
Booker?

06:54.210 --> 06:55.420
Booker, baby.
Are you okay?

06:55.420 --> 06:57.880
The same thing happened
in school today.

06:57.880 --> 06:59.750
What? Rae!
Did this ever happen to you?

06:59.750 --> 07:01.500
No, but I'm sure it's nothing.

07:01.500 --> 07:03.250
Levi, how long
was he stuck earlier?

07:03.250 --> 07:04.380
Not this long.

07:04.380 --> 07:07.290
What?
(gasps)

07:08.920 --> 07:10.290
You mean my baby's frozen?

07:12.250 --> 07:14.170
Maybe we should throw
water in his face?

07:14.170 --> 07:15.580
Nia, calm down, all right?

07:15.580 --> 07:17.000
That only happens in the movies.

07:18.250 --> 07:22.120
Don't worry my little ice pop,
I know somebody that can help.

07:22.120 --> 07:23.250
He has seen it all.

07:25.000 --> 07:26.620
I've never seen anything
like this in my life.

07:33.880 --> 07:35.000
Interesting.

07:36.330 --> 07:37.290
Fascinating.

07:37.290 --> 07:38.830
(snapping)

07:38.830 --> 07:40.210
Intriguing.

07:40.210 --> 07:42.170
Well, we tried everything
to snap him out of it.

07:42.170 --> 07:44.380
Have you tried throwing water
in his face?

07:44.380 --> 07:47.710
No. 'Cause apparently that
only happens in movies.

07:54.170 --> 07:56.290
-What's going on?
-Oh, my baby's back!

07:56.920 --> 07:57.960
Mom, where am I?

07:58.250 --> 08:02.670
Welcome to the Sleevemore Center
for Psychically Gifted Children.

08:02.670 --> 08:05.460
Yes. Sweetheart,
this is Dr. Sleevemore.

08:05.460 --> 08:08.250
He helped me with my visions
when I was your age.

08:08.250 --> 08:10.750
(sniffs)
What's that smell?

08:10.750 --> 08:12.580
Oh, that's the deep dish place
around the corner.

08:12.580 --> 08:13.380
Oh!

08:15.250 --> 08:18.120
Did y'all--Did y'all stop there
before y'all brought me in?

08:19.540 --> 08:21.960
We didn't know how long
you were gonna be out.

08:22.960 --> 08:24.000
Let's forget about the pizza.

08:24.000 --> 08:26.380
Listen, Dr. Sleevmore,
can you help my baby?

08:26.380 --> 08:27.290
Of course.

08:27.290 --> 08:31.210
But first, Booker, would you
like a glass of water?

08:31.210 --> 08:32.790
To drink.

08:32.790 --> 08:33.790
Sure.

08:34.290 --> 08:35.380
Leslie.

08:35.380 --> 08:36.750
Coming up.

08:40.080 --> 08:41.330
Oh-ho!

08:41.330 --> 08:43.620
She just levitated
that glass!

08:44.290 --> 08:45.750
You have visions.

08:45.750 --> 08:48.710
Others channel their
psychic energies differently.

08:48.710 --> 08:49.710
How's the water?

08:49.710 --> 08:52.250
A lot warmer than the one
he threw at me.

08:53.670 --> 08:55.330
Connor will cool it
down for you.

08:59.790 --> 09:02.210
Connor can freeze things
with his mind.

09:02.210 --> 09:05.040
Whoa! That's cool.

09:05.830 --> 09:08.170
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Connor freezes stuff

09:08.170 --> 09:10.960
and Leslie levitates stuff
but we all know

09:10.960 --> 09:13.670
my powers of suggestion
are way more impressive.

09:13.670 --> 09:15.540
No, they're not.

09:15.540 --> 09:19.040
-Yes, they are.
-Yes, they are.

09:19.880 --> 09:22.290
-And you have to pee.
-And I have to pee.

09:26.880 --> 09:28.380
This is Miles.

09:28.790 --> 09:32.620
Sometimes he gets a little
psychically competitive.

09:34.210 --> 09:35.460
He's cute.

09:37.540 --> 09:40.120
-He made me say that.
-No he didn't.

09:43.170 --> 09:44.790
Hey, what does
this little cutie do?

09:45.880 --> 09:48.540
Ow! Hey, hey!

09:49.040 --> 09:52.000
Serenity is electro-kinetic.

09:52.000 --> 09:53.880
Those are some powerful buns.

09:53.880 --> 09:56.210
Hey, I got a question.

09:56.210 --> 09:58.330
What about the guy
who came in here
with frozen visions?

09:58.330 --> 10:01.080
Maybe we should, um--
We should get back to him.

10:01.540 --> 10:03.040
Oh, right. Yes.

10:03.040 --> 10:05.120
Well, I'd like to
run some tests.

10:05.120 --> 10:07.420
And get to the bottom
of what's causing you
to glitch, Booker.

10:08.380 --> 10:12.960
By using this V-Activator 4.0,
we can induce a vision,

10:12.960 --> 10:15.830
thus allowing us to measure
Booker's psychic energy.

10:16.460 --> 10:17.460
Is it gonna hurt?

10:17.460 --> 10:19.540
Ever been stung in the head
by a thousand bees?

10:19.540 --> 10:21.290
-No!
-He's joking, baby.
He's joking.

10:21.290 --> 10:23.540
-You better be--
You better be joking.
-I'm joking!

10:23.540 --> 10:24.880
-Okay. You joking?
-I'm joking.

10:25.960 --> 10:27.250
This-- This won't hurt a bit.

10:30.080 --> 10:31.000
That's curious.

10:31.460 --> 10:33.420
This machine usually
sparks something.

10:33.420 --> 10:34.830
Oh, you want
to spark something?

10:34.830 --> 10:36.380
Put Booker and his sister
in a room together.

10:36.380 --> 10:38.750
They are twins that will not
stop fighting.

10:39.380 --> 10:42.250
Psychic twins?
Fascinating.

10:42.250 --> 10:44.290
No, no. Booker's psychic,
Nia's not.

10:45.210 --> 10:47.290
Even more fascinating.

10:52.330 --> 10:53.380
What?

10:54.380 --> 10:56.420
There's a theory that suggests
twins are connected

10:56.420 --> 10:58.380
on a deeper level
than most siblings.

10:58.380 --> 11:01.120
So, although Nia
may not have visions,

11:01.120 --> 11:03.460
their psychic energies
may be connected.

11:03.460 --> 11:06.080
This could be just the thing
that sparks a vision.

11:06.380 --> 11:08.170
Well, this sparked nothing.

11:08.960 --> 11:10.290
Well, since there's no spark

11:10.290 --> 11:11.620
what do you say
we get out of here?

11:11.620 --> 11:13.920
Sweetheart, we are here
to help your brother.

11:13.920 --> 11:16.710
Yeah. I have
a condition, Nia.

11:16.710 --> 11:18.210
Did you say
you need attention?

11:18.210 --> 11:20.210
Okay, all right.
It's been a long day.

11:20.210 --> 11:21.960
Dr. Sleevemore,
can we maybe

11:21.960 --> 11:23.290
pick this up again
tomorrow morning?

11:23.290 --> 11:24.620
No, Mom. I can't.

11:24.620 --> 11:26.210
We're live streaming
my very first

11:26.210 --> 11:28.250
Carver Corner segment
on community service.

11:28.250 --> 11:30.500
Um, our first segment.

11:30.500 --> 11:32.210
And it's gonna be
on skateboard stunts.

11:32.210 --> 11:34.540
Actually, I only need
to see Booker.

11:34.540 --> 11:35.920
-No!
-Yes!

11:35.920 --> 11:38.040
Wait a second.
So you don't need Nia?

11:38.040 --> 11:40.620
No. We can gather
her data remotely.

11:40.620 --> 11:42.750
She'll just have to wear
a mobile device.

11:42.750 --> 11:44.880
You won't even know
you're wearing it.

11:50.380 --> 11:53.830
Are you really gonna wear that
for your first live commentary?

11:53.830 --> 11:56.880
No. I'm gonna take it off,
do my commentary,

11:56.880 --> 11:58.330
then put it back on.

11:58.330 --> 12:00.750
Dr. Sleevemore
will never even know.

12:01.420 --> 12:03.790
(alarm blaring)

12:03.790 --> 12:05.830
Helmet:
Please put the helmet back on.

12:05.830 --> 12:08.330
Please put the helmet back on.

12:10.380 --> 12:12.620
(muffled)
Please put the helmet back on.

12:12.620 --> 12:14.790
Please put the helmet back on.

12:14.790 --> 12:16.380
Levi, what do I do?

12:17.040 --> 12:19.250
Uh, put the helmet back on.

12:19.250 --> 12:21.420
Helmet:
Please put the helmet back on.

12:26.380 --> 12:28.380
Welcome to
The Carver Corner Commentary

12:28.380 --> 12:30.620
with the Baxter-Carter twins.

12:30.620 --> 12:32.620
My twin is out sick.

12:33.420 --> 12:36.210
So, lucky for you,
I'll be your solo host today.

12:36.210 --> 12:37.710
Now, I know
you may be wondering

12:37.710 --> 12:39.290
why I'm wearing this helmet.

12:39.290 --> 12:40.710
I know I am.

12:42.120 --> 12:45.500
Because my topic today
is skateboarding.

12:45.500 --> 12:47.330
Skateboarding?

12:47.330 --> 12:50.080
I've combined
safety and fashion

12:50.080 --> 12:53.710
with his cute helmet
that's lit... and lit.

12:55.710 --> 12:57.620
I can't believe
she stole my topic.

12:58.250 --> 13:00.920
Look, she's even
throwing her arms up like me.

13:01.330 --> 13:02.420
What is she doing?

13:02.420 --> 13:04.710
It looks like
she can't control her arms.

13:06.460 --> 13:08.210
What's wrong with Nia?

13:11.540 --> 13:14.290
Oh, I must have activated
the Limbulator.

13:14.290 --> 13:18.040
Since their brainwaves
are connected
through the helmet,

13:18.040 --> 13:21.920
it's causing Nia to simulate
the movement of Booker's limbs.

13:21.920 --> 13:23.540
(laughing)

13:23.540 --> 13:25.380
No, no! I gotta shut it off.
I gotta shut it off.

13:25.380 --> 13:26.500
-Man:
Hey!

13:26.500 --> 13:28.210
Oh, wrong switch.

13:29.920 --> 13:32.250
Come with me, Raven. We've got
some 'splaining to do.

13:33.920 --> 13:37.790
Now, back to that
segment stealer.

13:39.460 --> 13:41.120
(machine whirs)

13:41.120 --> 13:45.040
Nia:
Um, anyway. Skateboard safety
is a very serious subject.

13:45.040 --> 13:48.120
which apparently makes me
want to dance.

13:49.790 --> 13:52.250
And smell my armpit.

13:55.380 --> 13:56.670
And do the sprinkler.

13:57.790 --> 13:59.330
Can we cut to commercial?

14:00.080 --> 14:01.580
We don't have commercials.

14:02.710 --> 14:04.330
I'd just cut.

14:09.420 --> 14:11.330
Wow, Booker.
That was pretty funny

14:11.330 --> 14:12.790
the way you
limbulated your sister.

14:14.120 --> 14:16.330
She is gonna be
so mad at you.

14:16.330 --> 14:18.380
Ha! How's she gonna know
it was me?

14:18.380 --> 14:20.500
She's not psychic.

14:20.500 --> 14:21.790
(laughing)

14:22.790 --> 14:24.420
You made me sniff
my armpit.

14:25.880 --> 14:27.620
You stole
my skateboarding segment.

14:27.620 --> 14:29.290
Only because I have to wear
this dumb helmet

14:29.290 --> 14:30.500
because of your "condition".

14:30.500 --> 14:31.580
It is a condition!

14:31.580 --> 14:33.000
-It's attention.
-Condition.

14:33.000 --> 14:34.290
-Attention!
-Condition!

14:34.290 --> 14:36.000
Baxters, shut it down.

14:36.330 --> 14:37.250
Wait, wait, wait.

14:37.250 --> 14:39.380
We're finally getting
some psychic activity.

14:39.380 --> 14:40.500
More arguing.

14:40.500 --> 14:41.420
No problem.

14:41.960 --> 14:43.670
You're a
skateboard segment stealin',

14:43.670 --> 14:46.000
shirt imitatin',
sayin' everything I'm sayin',

14:46.000 --> 14:48.170
-spanakopita eatin'--
-(energy rushing)

14:50.170 --> 14:51.080
Booker?

14:51.710 --> 14:53.210
Uh-oh. He's frozen again.

14:54.210 --> 14:55.960
This can only mean one thing.

14:55.960 --> 14:59.210
All the twins' arguing
is causing a viscosity

14:59.210 --> 15:01.210
in Booker's
psychic prismatic field,

15:01.210 --> 15:04.540
which manifests itself as a
catatonic mid-vision condition.

15:05.500 --> 15:08.040
I don't know what you said
but can you cure my baby?

15:10.080 --> 15:11.380
Yes.

15:11.380 --> 15:13.960
All I have to do
is clean out the visions.

15:13.960 --> 15:16.250
But in order to do that,
I'll have to remove them.

15:16.830 --> 15:19.080
Oh, well. Only temporarily.
Right, doc?

15:21.170 --> 15:22.460
Well that's the hope.

15:22.460 --> 15:25.420
But I should warn you
there's a possibility he'll...

15:25.420 --> 15:26.960
lose them forever.

15:35.250 --> 15:37.040
Is there any way
to clean his visions

15:37.040 --> 15:38.620
without having to
remove them?

15:38.880 --> 15:40.250
I'm afraid there isn't.

15:40.250 --> 15:41.250
But don't worry.

15:41.250 --> 15:43.250
My associate,
Dr. Jasmine

15:43.250 --> 15:44.210
will oversee the procedure.

15:44.210 --> 15:46.080
She's the best in the field.

15:46.080 --> 15:47.290
Ah, here she is now.

15:47.750 --> 15:50.290
OMG, I totally over-conditioned.

15:51.790 --> 15:54.580
Oh, I have to go.
I have a patient.

15:56.380 --> 15:58.790
(clears throat)
Hello, I'm Dr. Jasmine.

15:59.250 --> 16:01.830
You're son
is in good hands.

16:01.830 --> 16:02.960
Let's see these hands.

16:02.960 --> 16:04.460
Uh-uh. These hands
are too tiny.

16:06.170 --> 16:07.380
Don't let her age fool you.

16:07.380 --> 16:09.210
My associate is a genius.

16:09.960 --> 16:11.290
Interesting.

16:12.540 --> 16:13.540
Fascinating.

16:16.120 --> 16:17.420
Intriguing.

16:18.290 --> 16:19.580
She's also
my granddaughter.

16:20.750 --> 16:23.330
(clears throat)
I concur with your initial
diagnosis, doctor.

16:23.920 --> 16:26.540
Prepare for
ocular vision extraction!

16:27.460 --> 16:29.420
Yes, everybody.
Let's just prepare

16:29.420 --> 16:31.250
for what Dr. Tiny Hands said.

16:33.460 --> 16:35.380
Sweetheart,
it's gonna be okay.

16:36.420 --> 16:39.460
Mom, can I have
a moment with Booker?

16:39.460 --> 16:41.250
Yeah.

16:44.290 --> 16:46.170
Hey, Book. I don't know
if you can hear me

16:46.170 --> 16:49.960
but I'm really sorry
for all of our fighting.

16:50.540 --> 16:52.960
I promise I'll try
really hard

16:52.960 --> 16:54.960
not to always argue
but just please wake up and...

16:56.880 --> 16:58.170
and be you.

17:01.380 --> 17:03.380
No, thank you, Leslie.
I'm good.

17:03.380 --> 17:08.380
No. That's for me.
(blows nose)

17:09.880 --> 17:12.500
My babies love each other.

17:12.500 --> 17:15.540
They do! Come here.
I can't take it.

17:20.210 --> 17:22.540
Now, the ocular vision
extractor will remove

17:22.540 --> 17:25.290
Booker's psychic energy,
travel through this tube,

17:25.290 --> 17:29.330
and if all goes well,
it will be deposited
into this beaker.

17:29.620 --> 17:31.290
And if all doesn't go well?

17:31.290 --> 17:32.330
I'm gonna give her
a time out

17:32.330 --> 17:33.920
she's never had
before in her life.

17:36.120 --> 17:38.250
(machine beeping
and whirring)

17:43.080 --> 17:44.120
(Raven gasps)

17:45.120 --> 17:46.330
It's working.

17:46.330 --> 17:48.960
Working? It's disgusting.

17:49.580 --> 17:51.420
If Booker's psychic energy
was clean,

17:51.420 --> 17:54.960
that light would not be cloudy.
It would be vibrant purple.

17:57.040 --> 17:58.250
What's going on?

17:58.250 --> 18:00.000
Sweetheart, you froze again
but it's okay.

18:00.000 --> 18:01.500
They found a way
to fix the problem.

18:01.500 --> 18:02.960
Great! How?

18:02.960 --> 18:05.290
We had to remove
your visions.

18:05.290 --> 18:08.210
What?
My visions are gone?

18:08.210 --> 18:09.540
No, they're right here.

18:09.540 --> 18:11.120
Who are you?

18:11.120 --> 18:12.290
Your doctor.

18:13.290 --> 18:14.250
What?

18:14.250 --> 18:15.790
Don't worry, Booker.

18:15.790 --> 18:17.290
Your visions just need
to be cleaned

18:17.290 --> 18:18.290
before they can
put them back.

18:18.920 --> 18:19.920
Wow.

18:21.250 --> 18:22.420
So, that's me?

18:23.750 --> 18:25.210
Why is it so dirty?

18:25.210 --> 18:27.210
Well, that's what happens

18:27.210 --> 18:29.500
when you and your sister
argue excessively.

18:31.000 --> 18:31.880
Wow.

18:32.620 --> 18:34.210
Sorry, Nia.

18:34.210 --> 18:37.420
I guess arguing isn't good
for either of us.

18:39.120 --> 18:40.710
Aren't you gonna
apologize back?

18:43.210 --> 18:45.330
Look, I'm just glad
you're back to being you.

18:46.880 --> 18:48.460
So, we're good?

18:49.880 --> 18:51.420
We're good.

18:51.420 --> 18:52.420
Good.

18:52.420 --> 18:55.290
Now, let's clean this sucker.

18:56.670 --> 19:00.330
While the Prismatic Recalibrator
is cleaning his visions,

19:00.330 --> 19:02.460
Dr. Jasmine and I
have to check some data

19:02.460 --> 19:04.170
on the mainframe.

19:04.830 --> 19:06.210
So, what do we do now?

19:06.210 --> 19:08.120
We wait.

19:08.710 --> 19:10.210
(glass resonates)

19:12.080 --> 19:14.710
Look, I am
musically inclined!

19:15.210 --> 19:16.880
Yeah, no one's head
is coming off.

19:19.120 --> 19:21.380
Booker, it's turning purple.
It's working!

19:23.670 --> 19:25.880
My vision power is clean.

19:25.880 --> 19:27.290
I'm back!

19:28.420 --> 19:29.540
(glass continues resonating)

19:29.540 --> 19:30.580
(banging on glass)

19:30.580 --> 19:31.830
Stop the music!

19:32.460 --> 19:34.080
Serenity.

19:34.080 --> 19:36.830
The musical vibrations
can have an adverse affect

19:36.830 --> 19:39.290
on her electro-magnetic
frequencies.

19:40.380 --> 19:41.670
Leslie, we need help.

19:43.380 --> 19:44.170
(Raven gasps)

19:45.670 --> 19:47.710
Look at me!
I'm floating.

19:48.380 --> 19:50.120
Booker, don't just stand there.

19:50.120 --> 19:51.210
Get a camera!

19:51.880 --> 19:53.040
That was my vision.

19:53.750 --> 19:55.500
Let's hope Serenity
wasn't affected.

19:55.500 --> 19:56.710
(electricity crackling)

19:57.710 --> 19:58.960
That doesn't look good.

19:59.460 --> 20:00.960
She needs to release
her energy.

20:00.960 --> 20:02.790
Stand back
from anything metal.

20:04.040 --> 20:05.420
(gasps)
Oh, zap.

20:06.210 --> 20:09.000
(Raven screaming)

20:13.290 --> 20:14.620
Whoa!

20:14.620 --> 20:15.710
My visions!

20:15.710 --> 20:19.120
(slow motion) No!

20:19.120 --> 20:21.290
(glass breaking)

20:21.290 --> 20:22.420
(electricity sparking)

20:24.290 --> 20:25.380
(electricity surging)

20:31.830 --> 20:33.120
Where did it go?

20:33.120 --> 20:34.380
Where are my visions?

20:35.170 --> 20:36.420
I think they're gone.

20:37.170 --> 20:40.120
Gone?
But where?

20:40.120 --> 20:41.500
I don't know, baby.

20:41.500 --> 20:43.040
I don't know.

20:46.790 --> 20:48.790
(dramatic music playing)
