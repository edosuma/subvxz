- Hello?

02:18.671 --> 02:20.606

02:21.774 --> 02:23.408
Do you speak English?

Hello?

02:56.509 --> 02:59.411
Yeah, I know her.

02:59.413 --> 03:01.647
But it's been...

03:06.286 --> 03:08.554
Shit.

03:10.323 --> 03:12.824
How did she die?

03:14.928 --> 03:16.862
No, she didn't
have a kid.

03:20.833 --> 03:24.670
Why are you telling
me this?

03:26.639 --> 03:30.442
Wait, wait, you sure
it's mine?

03:31.344 --> 03:35.280
Look, I get that but...

03:36.616 --> 03:39.251
Isn't there anyone else
you can call?

03:41.788 --> 03:44.223
Where in Mexico?

03:44.958 --> 03:46.892
Okay.

03:46.894 --> 03:49.394
Okay,
I'll call you back.

04:54.827 --> 04:56.962
- What's up with you?

04:56.964 --> 04:59.398
- I get the shakes.

04:59.400 --> 05:01.733
- That happens if you
go cold Turkey.

05:03.803 --> 05:05.804
- Haven't tried for
a while.

05:14.447 --> 05:17.316
- How do you know
this guy?

05:17.318 --> 05:18.483
- He's all right.

05:18.485 --> 05:20.552
Been working for
big Dave.

05:20.554 --> 05:22.754
- I ain't never seen
you before.

05:25.758 --> 05:30.896
- I ain't been
around long.

05:30.898 --> 05:33.465
- How much you want
for the shit?

05:33.467 --> 05:35.667
- Whatever's fair.

05:41.341 --> 05:43.342
- You hear about Randall?

05:43.344 --> 05:45.110
- What?
Fat Shirley's Randall?

05:45.112 --> 05:46.912
- No, randal from up
the road.

05:46.914 --> 05:48.880
Old fucking wheelchair
Randall.

05:48.882 --> 05:49.848
- Shit, yeah.

05:49.850 --> 05:51.383
How's old boy doing?

05:51.385 --> 05:53.018
- He dead.

05:53.686 --> 05:55.954
- Get the fuck out
of here.

05:55.956 --> 05:57.856
- You say this is
good shit?

05:57.858 --> 05:59.624
Let's see if the lady
can dance.

06:06.900 --> 06:10.936
I'll put five minutes
on the clock.

06:13.806 --> 06:14.606
- C'mon, tell me, man.

06:14.608 --> 06:16.007
How he dead?

06:16.009 --> 06:17.876
- Well he won the scratchers,
ten grand.

06:17.878 --> 06:19.111
- No kidding.

06:19.113 --> 06:21.046
- Yeah well you know
his wife?

06:21.048 --> 06:22.114
- Nah.

06:22.116 --> 06:23.648
- Fucking hot.

06:23.650 --> 06:25.550
I mean hot for
Randall at least.

06:25.552 --> 06:27.486
Work down there at the
soap factory.

06:27.488 --> 06:29.688
Man, ain't never any
body seen her so

06:29.690 --> 06:31.523
much in love with the
motherfucker.

06:31.525 --> 06:33.492
She been cooking for him,
and cleaning for him,

06:33.494 --> 06:34.993
sucking on his
old cripple dick

06:34.995 --> 06:36.728
from time to time.

06:36.730 --> 06:38.063
Now the only
problem is,

06:38.065 --> 06:40.932
old Randall started
getting real sick.

06:40.934 --> 06:43.168
Puking over the
side of his wheelchair.

06:43.170 --> 06:44.603
His fucking skin's
turning yellow,

06:44.605 --> 06:46.605
his hair's falling out.

06:46.607 --> 06:48.140
The genius he is,
thinks it's the booze,

06:48.142 --> 06:49.441
so he goes on
the wagon.

06:49.443 --> 06:50.876
But that shit
ain't helping.

07:06.859 --> 07:09.428
Old Randall check himself
into the hospital.

07:09.430 --> 07:12.931
Two days later, the
motherfucker's dead.

07:12.933 --> 07:16.601
Doctors say they found
him filled to the

07:16.603 --> 07:18.470
gills with industrial lye.

07:18.472 --> 07:22.207
- Holy shit!

07:31.984 --> 07:33.485
- Turns out his old lady
been sneaking it

07:33.487 --> 07:35.620
into his food a little
at a time.

07:35.622 --> 07:37.122
Stealing it from the soap
factory.

07:37.124 --> 07:40.225
Angling on taking Randall's
scratcher money.

07:40.993 --> 07:42.961
- Bitches, all of 'em.

08:09.856 --> 08:14.226
- Hey, you got
three minutes left.

08:14.228 --> 08:15.660
The fuck kind of crank
you trying to

08:15.662 --> 08:16.828
push on us, hombre?

08:16.830 --> 08:20.232
Some advil and baby
laxatives shit?

08:20.234 --> 08:21.266
- That's a solid cook...

08:21.268 --> 08:23.735
- Solid cook?
Fucking bullshit.

08:23.737 --> 08:26.037
How'd you see this
thing playing out?

08:26.039 --> 08:28.940
You sit the fuck down!

08:28.942 --> 08:31.643
- I'm getting big Dave
down here right fucking now!

08:33.179 --> 08:33.912
- Shit!

10:52.185 --> 10:54.019
- Hey it's Warren.

10:54.021 --> 10:55.687
I'm driving.

10:55.689 --> 10:57.856
I can be at the border
by Thursday.

10:57.858 --> 10:59.324
Look, I don't know exactly
where I'm going.

10:59.326 --> 11:01.793
I need an address.

11:01.795 --> 11:02.994
I'll call back.

12:10.263 --> 12:13.231
- We're sorry, your call cannot
be completed as dialed.

12:13.233 --> 12:16.401
Please check the number
and dial again.

12:26.012 --> 12:30.014
We're sorry, your call cannot
be completed as dialed.

12:30.016 --> 12:32.484
Please check the number
and dial again.

13:07.953 --> 13:10.088
- This is Warren, again.

13:10.090 --> 13:11.523
Look I'm close to
the border.

13:11.525 --> 13:14.859
In some motel somewhere
in the middle of nowhere.

13:14.861 --> 13:16.161
I need to know where
I'm going.

13:16.163 --> 13:18.296
So until you call me back,
this is as far as I go.

14:23.362 --> 14:25.296
- Staying or passing through.

14:25.298 --> 14:27.198
- Just passing through.

14:32.504 --> 14:34.439
Bedford flats?

14:34.441 --> 14:38.176
- Yeah, founded by the
bedford corporation.

14:38.178 --> 14:41.279
Hunting town, used to chase
buffalo out on

14:41.281 --> 14:44.148
the salt flats till they
ran out of steam.

14:45.150 --> 14:47.118
Something they picked up
from the Indians.

14:47.653 --> 14:48.987
- Hunters, huh?

14:48.989 --> 14:50.355
- Not for a long time.

16:34.027 --> 16:36.260
- You're done, Bob.

16:36.262 --> 16:38.296
Want me to get the
sheriff again?

16:38.564 --> 16:40.264
Now finish up and get
on out of here.

16:41.700 --> 16:43.701
Everyone's sick of
your shit.

17:45.664 --> 17:47.799
- Hey bud!

17:47.801 --> 17:50.368
Didn't catch your name.

17:50.370 --> 17:51.335
- Warren.

17:51.337 --> 17:54.272
- Steve.

17:54.274 --> 17:55.840
So are you staying or
passing through?

17:55.842 --> 17:58.209
- Just passing through.

17:58.211 --> 18:00.378
- Wanted to give you
my number.

18:00.380 --> 18:00.378
- Nah, it's cool.

18:00.380 --> 18:03.614
- C'mon man, this isn't some
gay pick up thing.

18:03.616 --> 18:03.614
I'm not coming
onto you,

18:03.616 --> 18:05.550
I just collect
lost causes.

18:05.552 --> 18:06.417
That's all.

18:10.522 --> 18:13.357
- Thanks.

18:13.359 --> 18:15.259
- Sticking around for
the festival?

18:16.195 --> 18:18.129
- That's what these are?

18:18.131 --> 18:19.497
- Yeah.

18:19.499 --> 18:20.598
Yeah, the kids
make them.

18:20.600 --> 18:21.766
They're great, huh?

18:21.768 --> 18:23.201
- Sure.

18:23.203 --> 18:24.735
- All right, well call me
anytime, bud.

18:24.737 --> 18:26.204
Day or night, okay?

19:11.483 --> 19:13.184
Warren: Look, you called me.

19:13.186 --> 19:14.252
I'm ready to head across
the border,

19:14.254 --> 19:15.453
I want to help the kid.

19:15.455 --> 19:16.854
But you got to tell me
where to go.

19:16.856 --> 19:18.256
Call me back.

19:23.796 --> 19:24.896
- While you're travelling
America's highways

19:24.898 --> 19:24.896
and by ways.

19:24.898 --> 19:24.896
You may just want to make
an unscheduled

19:24.898 --> 19:30.368
stop in a little place called
bedford flats.

19:30.370 --> 19:33.371
Bedford flats is
a community that cares

19:33.373 --> 19:35.573
and a community
that hunts.

19:35.575 --> 19:37.542
That's right, we share our
desert home with

19:37.544 --> 19:39.177
some of the most
diverse wildlife in

19:39.179 --> 19:40.678
the United States.

19:40.680 --> 19:44.682
Including bison, duck,
and white tailed deer.

19:44.684 --> 19:46.384
Yes, from the birds in
the sky to the fish

19:46.386 --> 19:48.953
in our waters, everything is
fair game.

19:48.955 --> 19:52.390
And thanks to the fishing
game act of 1895

19:52.392 --> 19:54.692
it's open season all
year round,

19:54.694 --> 19:57.428
driving our little town's
bustling economy.

19:57.430 --> 19:59.363
And of course, the annual
bedford flats

19:59.365 --> 20:01.365
hunting festival is truly
an affair for the

20:01.367 --> 20:03.267
whole family to enjoy.

20:03.269 --> 20:04.769
It's the way we've
always done it,

20:04.771 --> 20:07.438
and the way we'll always do
it in out little town.

20:07.440 --> 20:11.842
Tradition, without it we're
nothing.

21:22.648 --> 21:23.714
- The truck's just down
the road.

21:23.716 --> 21:26.951
Wallet's in the glove
compartment.

21:28.287 --> 21:30.755
- I'm not supposed to...

21:30.757 --> 21:32.657
- I'll come right back.

21:32.659 --> 21:35.693
Scouts honor.

22:28.848 --> 22:28.846
Steve: Hello?

22:28.848 --> 22:31.882
- It's Warren,
from the meeting.

22:31.884 --> 22:33.984
- Hey bud, about time
you called.

22:33.986 --> 22:36.487
- I need help.

22:50.669 --> 22:53.037
- I am so glad you
reached out.

22:53.905 --> 22:57.608
- Yeah I'm ready to
make a you know, change.

22:57.610 --> 22:57.608
- Everybody gets sick
and tired

22:57.610 --> 22:59.977
of being sick
and tired, bud.

22:59.979 --> 23:01.579
We'll get you up and
running in no time.

23:02.981 --> 23:05.082
- So have you ever served
in the military?

23:05.084 --> 23:07.118
- Yeah in basic training.

23:07.120 --> 23:12.456
I mean just a few months but
didn't really work out.

23:12.958 --> 23:14.692
- Can I ask
what happened?

23:14.694 --> 23:16.060
- I stole a helicopter.

23:21.167 --> 23:24.101
- You can fly
a helicopter?

23:24.103 --> 23:26.604
- Well like I said,
it didn't really work out.

23:28.874 --> 23:31.809
- So do you exercise?
Do you work out?

23:31.811 --> 23:33.978
- Like in the gym
and shit?

23:33.980 --> 23:35.713
No.

23:37.183 --> 23:38.516
- When Steve was in
his disease,

23:38.518 --> 23:39.917
he didn't get off
the couch.

23:44.689 --> 23:47.191
- Say you mind if
i hit the head?

23:47.193 --> 23:48.559
- Just down the hall
to the left.

23:48.561 --> 23:50.594
- Yeah, thank you.

25:03.602 --> 25:07.938
- Staying or passing through?

25:07.940 --> 25:10.007
- Just meeting a friend.

25:37.302 --> 25:39.904
- You didn't mention
you had a kid.

25:39.906 --> 25:42.606
- I don't.

25:42.608 --> 25:45.242
- There's a bedroom.

25:45.244 --> 25:49.780
- Christopher was supposed
to be his name.

25:49.782 --> 25:51.148
- Sorry?

25:51.150 --> 25:51.148
- Cheryle was pregnant.

25:51.150 --> 25:53.784
And she got so excited
when the doctor

25:53.786 --> 25:55.185
told her she was gonna
have a boy that

25:55.187 --> 25:57.154
she decorated the room.

25:57.156 --> 26:01.325
Decided he was gonna be
a baseball player.

26:01.327 --> 26:04.628
And one night I was high,
i pushed her down,

26:04.630 --> 26:06.630
she lost the baby.

26:07.599 --> 26:11.201
But I got
a second chance.

26:11.203 --> 26:14.071
You ever gone cold Turkey
before?

26:15.640 --> 26:18.576
Most people don't die
from drinking.

26:18.578 --> 26:20.778
They die from
quitting drinking, bud.

26:20.780 --> 26:24.315
That's a fact.

26:24.317 --> 26:25.282
It starts with
the shakes,

26:25.284 --> 26:27.217
at least it did
for me.

26:27.219 --> 26:29.119
And then your
vision goes.

26:29.121 --> 26:32.656
Motor skills, thought process,
seizures.

26:32.658 --> 26:35.025
Peaks at twenty-four hours.

26:36.661 --> 26:39.296
- Well I appreciate the
encouragement.

26:41.067 --> 26:44.101
- Sorry.

26:45.103 --> 26:46.904
Sorry.

27:29.281 --> 27:30.381
- You shouldn't go through
other people's

27:30.383 --> 27:30.381
medicine cabinets.

27:32.651 --> 27:34.018
But if there's one thing
you can count

27:34.020 --> 27:36.654
on is that junkies will
be junkies.

27:36.656 --> 27:37.788
Hey bud.

27:58.444 --> 28:01.078
- Damn hombre.

28:01.080 --> 28:04.448
You fucked up real proper
this time.

28:30.443 --> 28:32.209
- Soon as these
cuffs come off,

28:32.211 --> 28:33.877
you're fucking dead.

28:34.379 --> 28:37.014
- I shouldn't be here!

28:37.016 --> 28:39.149
I shouldn't be here!

28:39.151 --> 28:41.318
Let me out!

28:47.292 --> 28:50.394
- Well, glad you boys
could make it.

28:50.396 --> 28:52.730
Warren, right?

29:07.046 --> 29:08.412
- This motherfucker stole
my merch.

29:08.414 --> 29:09.480
My beef's with him.

29:09.482 --> 29:11.348
- Not my problem, friend.

29:14.253 --> 29:14.251
All right, all right.

29:14.253 --> 29:17.287
Now you boys
shut the hell up.

29:17.289 --> 29:18.989
- Man fuck y'all!

29:18.991 --> 29:20.758
You hear me you
crazy old prick?

29:22.461 --> 29:23.494
- Fuck you!

29:25.498 --> 29:27.798
- That's my grandson,
junior.

29:27.800 --> 29:29.466
Dumb as a bucket
of nails,

29:29.468 --> 29:32.035
but he sure can lay down
an ass whooping.

29:35.508 --> 29:38.175
Hello bedford flats!

29:38.177 --> 29:39.877
How we feeling tonight?!

29:45.183 --> 29:46.917
We've gathered here
once again to

29:46.919 --> 29:48.352
remember where
we came from

29:48.354 --> 29:50.788
before the great
herds died off

29:50.790 --> 29:54.525
and men of low moral
character overran our gates.

29:54.527 --> 29:57.528
Men like the five we
have here tonight.

29:57.530 --> 29:59.296
Bad men.

29:59.298 --> 30:01.865
In their own way,
they are all a burden

30:01.867 --> 30:03.834
on our community.

30:03.836 --> 30:08.806
Never forget that we
are a town of hunters.

30:08.808 --> 30:11.542
Great herds may be
long gone,

30:11.544 --> 30:14.244
but we know who
we are.

30:14.246 --> 30:18.849
Tradition! Without it,
we're nothing.

30:18.851 --> 30:21.418
So we're going to
play a game.

30:21.420 --> 30:25.155
It's not a game so we might
forget our troubles,

30:25.157 --> 30:28.258
but so we might remember
our past.

30:28.260 --> 30:30.460
The rules are simple.

30:30.462 --> 30:33.997
You run,
we hunt you.

30:33.999 --> 30:36.300
We catch you, we kill you.

30:36.302 --> 30:39.336
That's pretty much the
extent of it.

30:39.338 --> 30:40.838
Welcome to the hunt!

30:45.578 --> 30:47.444
- Please sheriff, please!

30:47.446 --> 30:49.446
I promise I won't
drink anymore.

30:49.448 --> 30:51.515
- I told you to put
down the bottle,

30:51.517 --> 30:52.883
I gave you chances.

30:52.885 --> 30:54.952
- I won't.
I won't!

30:54.954 --> 30:56.520
I promise not to
drink anymore.

30:56.522 --> 30:58.889
- Lay down with dogs,
you get up with fleas.

30:58.891 --> 30:59.923
- Look at me!

30:59.925 --> 31:01.291
I'm not going to
make it!

31:01.293 --> 31:02.392
No one does!

31:02.394 --> 31:03.961
- Bob! Bob! Look at
your poor folks.

31:03.963 --> 31:05.229
Look what you've
done to them.

31:05.231 --> 31:07.598
People are sick of
your shit!

31:08.366 --> 31:09.900
All right, all right.

31:09.902 --> 31:12.970
I'd like to introduce you to
this year's hunters.

31:13.371 --> 31:17.007
First up, know him,
love him,

31:17.009 --> 31:19.977
probably buy your
beer from him.

31:20.211 --> 31:22.412
Here for his twelfth
consecutive year,

31:22.414 --> 31:25.315
my main man,
don Lincoln!

31:28.520 --> 31:31.955
Next up, I've known these
three hell raisers

31:31.957 --> 31:33.490
since before they
could crawl.

31:33.492 --> 31:37.027
And they were as mean
then as they are now,

31:37.029 --> 31:39.129
the wakowskis!

31:41.267 --> 31:44.468
And finally,
a real success story,

31:44.470 --> 31:47.104
and one of the
nicest guys around.

31:47.106 --> 31:51.508
Steve Patterson, hunting with
his lovely wife, Cheryl.

31:51.943 --> 31:56.947
All right now let's cut
these boys loose.

32:05.957 --> 32:07.457
- Get the fuck out of
my way!

32:08.259 --> 32:09.960
Get out of my way!

32:09.962 --> 32:11.361
- Seeing as the only one
of you who's

32:11.363 --> 32:13.196
familiar with this
whole situation,

32:13.198 --> 32:15.933
running like
a bat out of hell,

32:15.935 --> 32:17.968
may I suggest you
follow suit.

32:19.437 --> 32:21.505
Somebody get me a drink!

32:22.540 --> 32:24.207
- Need to have a sporting
chance, bud.

32:24.209 --> 32:25.509
There's a light at the
end of the tunnel.

32:25.511 --> 32:27.311
I found it,
and you can too.

32:30.282 --> 32:33.283
- All right!
- Woo!

33:43.688 --> 33:46.323
- Come on!

33:53.331 --> 33:55.232
It's probably horse
tranquilizers and LSD

33:55.234 --> 33:57.100
but what the fuck, right?

34:16.822 --> 34:20.724
Slow it down.

34:20.726 --> 34:24.628
We got a head start.

34:39.077 --> 34:40.710
Now we should run.

35:30.796 --> 35:33.563
- Stop! Stop!

35:35.133 --> 35:37.134
I know what to do.

35:37.136 --> 35:38.902
Just hold on,
i know what to do.

35:59.357 --> 36:01.825
- Looks like first blood
goes to wakowski's.

36:04.929 --> 36:06.429
- Why they doing this?

36:06.431 --> 36:07.831
- It's just what we
do man.

36:07.833 --> 36:09.299
It's like, like always.

36:09.301 --> 36:11.701
It brings the community
together, you know?

36:11.703 --> 36:12.769
- No I don't fucking know.

36:12.771 --> 36:13.937
- Oh look man,
it's once a year.

36:13.939 --> 36:15.872
It's not like an
every day thing!

36:37.429 --> 36:38.461
- There's four of us.

36:38.463 --> 36:41.698
We have to split up,
better odds.

36:41.700 --> 36:43.900
- I'll see you on the other
side of this,

36:43.902 --> 36:45.669
I'm still gonna kill you.

36:45.671 --> 36:47.837
- Well cross that bridge
when we get to it.

36:47.839 --> 36:49.673
- Yeah, we will.

36:49.675 --> 36:51.374
- Stop!

36:51.376 --> 36:53.743
- Run.

36:56.714 --> 36:58.515
- Over here!

36:58.517 --> 37:00.517
I got one!

37:00.751 --> 37:01.618
Got one!

37:01.620 --> 37:06.723
I got one! See!

37:10.795 --> 37:12.462
- Kill confirmed.

37:12.464 --> 37:14.497
- Looks like don snuck
in under the wire.

37:17.436 --> 37:21.771
- He's- he's- he's
all yours!

37:21.773 --> 37:24.541
Guys, i--
caught him for you!

37:24.543 --> 37:25.508
Stop, stop!

37:25.510 --> 37:26.676
I caught him for you.

37:26.678 --> 37:28.345
He's- he's all yours!

37:37.990 --> 37:39.422
- Get a picture.

37:44.629 --> 37:46.296
- No man,
take it long ways.

37:46.298 --> 37:47.264
- Who gives a shit?!

37:47.266 --> 37:48.598
- It looks stupid tall ways.

37:48.600 --> 37:50.400
Take it long ways, it looks
fucking cinematic!

37:57.908 --> 38:00.043
- That's two.

38:00.045 --> 38:03.813
- don, you motherfucker!

38:38.049 --> 38:40.850
- Love you, honey.

38:40.852 --> 38:42.519
- Love you more.

39:07.545 --> 39:09.112
- Cheryl!

41:17.475 --> 41:19.609
- Two of 'em made
it off the flats.

41:19.611 --> 41:21.010
- Well, folks, you know
what that means.

41:21.012 --> 41:24.047
Looks like we're
in overtime.

41:29.019 --> 41:32.722
- Might want to check on
Steve and the wife.

41:33.057 --> 41:36.626
- Copy that, big don.

41:36.628 --> 41:40.630
- I'm heading out.

43:25.704 --> 43:28.371
- So what happens if
you go cold Turkey?

43:40.250 --> 43:43.052
- When's the last time they
off'd one of ours?

43:43.054 --> 43:46.889
- Ninety-eight, I guess.
Burton mills.

43:46.891 --> 43:48.157
- Only son of a bitch
that ever hunted

43:48.159 --> 43:50.193
with his bare hands.

43:50.361 --> 43:52.362
It was a bad idea,
i told him.

43:52.364 --> 43:56.699
- Shit everybody did,
stubborn old bastard.

43:57.635 --> 43:59.836
That was Steve's year.

44:13.150 --> 44:14.817
Get in the car, boy!

44:14.819 --> 44:17.687
- What the fuck, dude?!

44:39.243 --> 44:42.078
- Psst.

44:50.721 --> 44:52.789
- Where are we?

44:55.859 --> 44:59.195
- That's the edge
of the flats,

44:59.197 --> 45:02.999
which puts us
about here.

45:03.001 --> 45:06.803
- Now what?

45:06.805 --> 45:09.305
- Straight through
the border.

45:09.307 --> 45:09.305
- Mexico?

45:09.307 --> 45:11.474
- Last I checked,
there was a whole town

45:11.476 --> 45:13.810
of freaks back
that way.

45:13.812 --> 45:15.211
- You'll fucking shoot
them, right?

45:15.213 --> 45:17.780
- There's one bullet here.

45:18.782 --> 45:22.418
Listen, Mexico it's our
best bet.

45:24.288 --> 45:27.023
- That gonna be okay?

45:27.491 --> 45:29.425
- Guess we'll find out.

46:44.836 --> 46:48.437
- Dope sick or what?

46:48.439 --> 46:51.507
- Booze mostly.

47:00.951 --> 47:05.054
You take this.

47:05.056 --> 47:08.891
One bullet,
don't be a dipshit.

47:32.349 --> 47:34.116
- Fuck yeah!

47:41.124 --> 47:46.863
- Hello bedford flats this
is your sheriff.

47:48.899 --> 47:51.500
I'm not gonna give you
a bum steer.

47:51.502 --> 47:54.170
We had some ups and downs
out there today.

47:54.172 --> 47:56.505
Our boy,
Bob didn't make it out.

47:56.507 --> 47:58.541
It was the best thing
for him.

47:58.543 --> 48:02.411
Condolences to his folks.

48:02.913 --> 48:05.181
As most of you know,
Cheryl Patterson has

48:05.183 --> 48:08.885
been pronounced dead.

48:08.887 --> 48:11.921
Steve's getting the medical
attention that he needs.

48:11.923 --> 48:14.924
We'll have him back on
his feet soon.

48:15.225 --> 48:17.059
But keep him in
your thoughts.

48:17.061 --> 48:20.129
He'll need us more than ever
when he comes to.

48:20.131 --> 48:23.399
But I can assure you that the
men responsible

48:23.401 --> 48:27.370
for these vicious acts will
not go free.

48:27.372 --> 48:30.539
These men are weak
and poorly made.

48:30.541 --> 48:32.508
It's only a matter of
time before

48:32.510 --> 48:35.411
don and the wakowski's
catch up to them.

48:35.413 --> 48:39.282
And when they do,
it will be painful.

48:39.284 --> 48:41.484
That's a promise.

48:43.453 --> 48:46.389
So keep your chins up,
bedford flats.

48:46.391 --> 48:49.392
It's hunts like these that
brings us all together.

50:00.231 --> 50:04.066
- Love you, honey.
- Love you more.

50:10.674 --> 50:12.141
Cheryl!

50:30.327 --> 50:31.594
- Bring them back
to me!

50:31.596 --> 50:34.163
Bring them back to me!

50:44.775 --> 50:47.810
- There's a radio!

51:06.797 --> 51:08.297
It's not doing anything.

51:56.580 --> 51:59.682
- What is that?

52:02.686 --> 52:07.323
- Ethanol.

52:34.618 --> 52:38.220
- Just leave me the
fuck alone, Barney!

52:39.389 --> 52:40.723
- Steve, you're not well.

52:40.725 --> 52:43.292
- Come on, just leave me
the fuck alone.

52:46.730 --> 52:48.364
- Steve?
Steve?!

53:39.482 --> 53:42.251
- We get to Mexico,
what then?

53:42.253 --> 53:45.554
- Gotta be honest,
as far as Mexico goes.

53:45.556 --> 53:51.360
It's a lateral move for me,
might fit right in.

53:51.695 --> 53:52.728
- What do I do?

53:52.730 --> 53:55.331
- Get to juarez,
find a consulate.

53:55.333 --> 53:56.765
Hope they deport you.

53:58.768 --> 54:02.504
- El Paso to outpost,
anyone copy?

54:02.506 --> 54:05.241
This is El Paso,
anyone copy?

54:05.243 --> 54:05.874
- Copy.

54:05.876 --> 54:07.476
- Saw the grid light up.

54:07.478 --> 54:08.544
Who am I talking to?

54:08.546 --> 54:09.745
You with parks?

54:09.747 --> 54:11.714
- No.

54:11.716 --> 54:11.714
- Forest service?

54:11.716 --> 54:13.983
- Dude, tell him!
Tell him! Tell him!

54:13.985 --> 54:16.752
- Stop, would you
believe us?

54:20.657 --> 54:22.491
We're backpackers.

54:22.493 --> 54:24.026
- You're way off the trail.

54:24.028 --> 54:25.694
How'd that shit happen?

54:25.696 --> 54:26.862
- Look, my friend here
is injured.

54:26.864 --> 54:28.497
Broken leg.

54:28.499 --> 54:31.333
Can you get air transport
in here asap?

54:31.335 --> 54:35.971
He's in a pretty bad way.

54:36.506 --> 54:39.708
- Gonna be hell
on your insurance.

54:39.710 --> 54:41.510
- We'll manage.

54:41.845 --> 54:44.313
- Only problem.

54:44.315 --> 54:45.948
Can't put down where
you're at.

54:45.950 --> 54:48.684
No landing area.

54:49.919 --> 54:51.487
- Okay, where ya thinking?

54:51.489 --> 54:51.487
- I got an idea.

54:51.489 --> 54:55.324
There's a radio beacon
a couple ranges back.

54:55.326 --> 54:57.059
That's way your way out.

54:57.061 --> 55:00.896
Go to the window.

55:02.299 --> 55:03.799
I need you to get
eyes on it.

55:03.801 --> 55:06.735
- Hang on.

55:07.070 --> 55:08.771
- I don't see it!

55:08.773 --> 55:09.938
- You boys looking?

55:09.940 --> 55:12.741
- Yeah, we're looking.

55:12.743 --> 55:13.676
- Good.

55:13.678 --> 55:16.979
Now I got a question
for you.

55:16.981 --> 55:18.547
- Yeah, what's that?

55:18.549 --> 55:20.983
- You wanna see the
insides of this kid's head?

56:04.628 --> 56:05.961
- Reach down, get the man

56:05.963 --> 56:07.863
with the yellow shirt.

56:07.865 --> 56:09.498
God has saved you.

56:09.500 --> 56:09.498
You are sinners.

56:09.500 --> 56:12.701
You will go to hell if you
don't do what you're told.

56:45.502 --> 56:48.003
- Why are you
people doing this?

56:48.005 --> 56:50.072
- Shit dude,
if you gotta ask,

56:50.074 --> 56:51.607
you ain't never
gonna understa-

56:51.609 --> 56:53.742
- understand.

57:18.168 --> 57:19.168
- What?

57:19.170 --> 57:21.003
- This is frank.

57:21.005 --> 57:22.070
- Shit, frank,
it's the middle of

57:22.072 --> 57:23.505
the damn night.

57:23.507 --> 57:25.073
- Sheriff,
I'm aware of that.

57:25.075 --> 57:28.210
But we've got what I think
you'd call a...Situation.

58:58.568 --> 59:01.270
- Steve, you dumb son
of a bitch.

59:57.628 --> 01:00:01.830
- Cerveza?

01:00:09.005 --> 01:00:11.239
Bad men back there.

01:00:11.774 --> 01:00:14.009
- There is bad men
everywhere.

01:00:16.245 --> 01:00:18.780
- Not like this.

01:00:55.018 --> 01:00:56.918
- Just leave it alone.

01:01:03.727 --> 01:01:06.428
Good morning, bedford flats.

01:01:06.430 --> 01:01:09.197
I wish you I could start
your day off right.

01:01:09.199 --> 01:01:12.401
But once again I bring
you bitter news.

01:01:12.403 --> 01:01:15.070
As some of you may
have already heard,

01:01:15.072 --> 01:01:16.938
the body of Barney Erickson
was found

01:01:16.940 --> 01:01:19.107
early this morning.

01:01:19.109 --> 01:01:23.078
The cause of his death,
still under investigation.

01:01:23.080 --> 01:01:24.980
This marks two of
our own that have been

01:01:24.982 --> 01:01:26.381
brutality taken
from us in the last

01:01:26.383 --> 01:01:28.784
twenty-four hours.

01:01:28.786 --> 01:01:31.053
I will not rest until
those responsible

01:01:31.055 --> 01:01:33.855
are brought to justice.

01:01:33.857 --> 01:01:36.758
Keep your chins up,
bedford flats.

01:02:23.005 --> 01:02:26.141
- Grandpa, can I ask
you a question?

01:02:26.143 --> 01:02:29.077
- What?

01:02:29.079 --> 01:02:34.416
- Do other towns...
Do this?

01:02:34.984 --> 01:02:38.120
- When I was your age,
maybe a little younger,

01:02:38.122 --> 01:02:40.956
I took a trip to Dallas
with the old man.

01:02:40.958 --> 01:02:43.191
First time in
the city.

01:02:43.193 --> 01:02:44.292
Saw a homeless gal
laying on the

01:02:44.294 --> 01:02:47.929
sidewalk out cold.

01:02:47.931 --> 01:02:50.298
I asked a cop if we
should try and help her.

01:02:50.300 --> 01:02:53.235
Well he looked at me
like I was some kind of idiot.

01:02:53.237 --> 01:02:55.003
You see,
in the city,

01:02:55.005 --> 01:02:56.404
they let their
problems die,

01:02:56.406 --> 01:02:58.807
slow right in front
of everybody.

01:02:58.809 --> 01:03:00.475
Here, we take our problems
out behind

01:03:00.477 --> 01:03:03.411
the woodshed and put
'em down proper.

01:03:03.413 --> 01:03:06.815
You're too young
to remember, but...

01:03:06.817 --> 01:03:09.151
This hunt can
help people.

01:03:13.056 --> 01:03:14.322
- You take Steve.

01:03:14.324 --> 01:03:16.525
He was raising all
kinds of hell.

01:03:16.527 --> 01:03:18.994
Drinking and drugging.

01:03:18.996 --> 01:03:21.296
Then that business
with the baby.

01:03:21.298 --> 01:03:22.964
Well, folks got fed up.

01:03:27.371 --> 01:03:30.405
Burnside: When I saw him
stumbling across the flats,

01:03:30.407 --> 01:03:32.274
I thought,
this guy is dead meat.

01:03:32.276 --> 01:03:33.975
But he showed us.

01:03:33.977 --> 01:03:36.077
Beat in Burton mills' head
with a rock.

01:03:37.380 --> 01:03:41.116
Figured we'd seen the
last of Steve.

01:03:41.118 --> 01:03:42.551
Then a month later,

01:03:42.553 --> 01:03:45.220
he shows up walking
down main street.

01:03:45.222 --> 01:03:47.289
But you could see it
in his eyes.

01:03:47.291 --> 01:03:50.258
He was a changed man.

01:03:52.963 --> 01:03:54.129
- Yeah, well,
Chris Nelson said

01:03:54.131 --> 01:03:56.598
we do this because
hunting people is fun.

01:03:56.600 --> 01:03:58.533
- Well, I suppose there's
that too.

01:03:58.535 --> 01:04:01.002
- Yeah.

01:04:01.004 --> 01:04:04.239
When are you gonna
let me hunt?

01:04:04.241 --> 01:04:06.474
- Not for a while yet.

01:09:47.783 --> 01:09:48.950
- Well, looks like you're
going cold Turkey

01:09:48.952 --> 01:09:52.654
after all, hombre.

01:09:52.656 --> 01:09:55.223
You know, you got
a lot of nerve, man.

01:09:55.225 --> 01:09:57.892
I'm practically the only
friend you got left.

01:10:06.670 --> 01:10:11.306
- Most people, they don't
die from drinking.

01:10:14.210 --> 01:10:16.744
They die from
quitting, bud.

01:10:16.746 --> 01:10:19.347
That's a fact.

01:10:22.252 --> 01:10:24.219
- It starts with
the shakes,

01:10:24.221 --> 01:10:26.554
at least it did
for me.

01:10:26.556 --> 01:10:28.289
And then your
vision goes.

01:10:28.291 --> 01:10:32.894
Motor skills, thought process,
seizures.

01:10:32.896 --> 01:10:35.797
Peaks at twenty-four hours.

01:10:44.006 --> 01:10:45.773
Oh, shit.

01:10:47.876 --> 01:10:49.811
You're gonna wanna bite
down on something, boy.

01:11:04.995 --> 01:11:06.361
- Come on, man.
You can do it.

01:11:06.363 --> 01:11:08.663
I got faith in you, man.

01:11:08.665 --> 01:11:10.598
I got all the faith in
the world in you,

01:11:10.600 --> 01:11:11.933
you sorry motherfucker.

01:11:40.696 --> 01:11:40.695
Bo dawg: You know an
animal in a trap,

01:11:40.697 --> 01:11:47.435
they'd gnaw their own
leg off to survive, but...

01:11:47.437 --> 01:11:49.737
You ain't got the rocks,
do you?

01:11:52.574 --> 01:11:55.810
So we both know how
this ends.

01:11:55.812 --> 01:11:58.846
You'll be damned if
some burnout desert

01:11:58.848 --> 01:12:01.482
psycho put you lights
out for good.

01:12:01.917 --> 01:12:03.785
No way, Jose.

01:12:03.787 --> 01:12:06.587
Not you.

01:12:07.523 --> 01:12:11.859
But where we're going,
you and me,

01:12:11.861 --> 01:12:14.429
people get it.

01:12:16.899 --> 01:12:22.003
They get us.

01:12:24.440 --> 01:12:26.507
- Do me a favor.

01:12:28.877 --> 01:12:31.813
Get fucked.

01:13:44.753 --> 01:13:46.554
- Hello bedford flats.

01:13:46.556 --> 01:13:50.525
This is your sheriff.

01:13:50.527 --> 01:13:53.761
It's been a tough
few days out here.

01:13:53.763 --> 01:13:58.800
I know this year hasn't
been the most fun,

01:13:58.802 --> 01:14:02.703
but we're gonna bring
Steve back safe and sound.

01:14:03.105 --> 01:14:06.441
The man's been
through hell.

01:14:06.443 --> 01:14:08.576
Keep your chins
bedford flats.

01:14:11.680 --> 01:14:14.048
- Grandpa,
when we find Steve,

01:14:14.050 --> 01:14:15.450
we're gonna
kill 'em, right?

01:14:15.452 --> 01:14:17.919
- Well that depends
on Steve.

01:14:18.454 --> 01:14:20.988
- When I'm hunting,
I'm gonna kill everyone.

01:15:12.241 --> 01:15:14.642
- We got a dead man
back in town.

01:15:14.644 --> 01:15:16.177
- You got a lotta
dead men, boss.

01:15:16.179 --> 01:15:17.812
- You know what I'm
talking about!

01:15:17.814 --> 01:15:19.080
You got his gun
in your belt.

01:15:19.082 --> 01:15:20.181
- What?
This one?

01:15:20.183 --> 01:15:21.015
- Don't you fucking move!

01:15:21.017 --> 01:15:22.650
- Stay back.

01:15:22.652 --> 01:15:23.951
You're in no condition
to hunt.

01:15:23.953 --> 01:15:25.820
Time to call the game.

01:15:25.822 --> 01:15:27.722
- Just shoot him, grandpa.
Just shoot him!

01:15:27.724 --> 01:15:29.156
- Shut the fuck up!

01:15:29.158 --> 01:15:32.093
Now this Warren,
he's just one man.

01:15:32.095 --> 01:15:33.761
And you don't know
where he is.

01:15:33.763 --> 01:15:35.663
- But I know where
he's gonna be!

01:15:35.665 --> 01:15:36.964
- Give it up, Steven.

01:15:36.966 --> 01:15:39.133
- How do you think
i hid from you

01:15:39.135 --> 01:15:42.770
crazy fuckers for a
whole fucking month

01:15:42.772 --> 01:15:44.672
back in
ninety-eight, huh?!

01:15:44.674 --> 01:15:46.240
How?!
Cause I know!

01:15:46.242 --> 01:15:48.142
I know where he's
gonna be!

01:15:48.144 --> 01:15:49.110
- Grandpa, I got him!

01:15:49.112 --> 01:15:51.112
- Shut the hell up!

01:15:53.181 --> 01:15:55.917
- Now how you holding
for road flares?

01:15:55.919 --> 01:15:57.285
- Eat shit, motherfucker!

01:16:05.628 --> 01:16:08.095
- Corn fed motherfucker!

01:16:11.800 --> 01:16:14.869
That's why you
never hunted.

01:16:14.871 --> 01:16:17.805
You never could
fucking shoot!

01:16:17.807 --> 01:16:20.641
- I thought you were
a changed man, Steven.

01:16:25.347 --> 01:16:29.216
Radio: Sheriff?
Sheriff, are you there?

01:16:31.587 --> 01:16:33.588
Sheriff?

01:16:39.928 --> 01:16:42.296
Sheriff, this is frank.
Do you copy?

01:16:44.866 --> 01:16:48.169
- Hey frank,
is that you?

01:16:48.904 --> 01:16:50.071
- Steve?

01:16:50.073 --> 01:16:52.239
- No.

01:16:52.241 --> 01:16:55.710
This-
this is sheriff speaking.

01:16:56.111 --> 01:16:58.879
- Steve, where are you?

01:16:58.881 --> 01:17:00.748
What's happening?

01:17:00.750 --> 01:17:02.717
Put the sheriff on.

01:17:02.719 --> 01:17:06.721
- Okay, okay, okay. Okay.

01:17:11.127 --> 01:17:15.029
Okay, let's get
serious now.

01:17:17.799 --> 01:17:19.333
This is the
sheriff here,

01:17:19.335 --> 01:17:21.335
and I just want to
say to all you

01:17:21.337 --> 01:17:28.709
faggots in bedford flats,
have a real happy hunt.

01:17:28.711 --> 01:17:32.113
- You son of a bitch.

01:17:35.217 --> 01:17:37.752
- Okay.

01:17:37.754 --> 01:17:39.887
No more fucking around.

01:17:40.288 --> 01:17:45.993
I think that we should
change up the hunt.

01:17:45.995 --> 01:17:47.862
I know you guys are
all stuck on this

01:17:47.864 --> 01:17:51.699
deliverance hillbilly
buffalo hunting bullshit.

01:17:51.701 --> 01:17:54.268
I think we should
do a more

01:17:54.270 --> 01:17:56.337
all-American sport.

01:17:56.339 --> 01:17:59.974
I think we should get
rid of this shit

01:17:59.976 --> 01:18:01.275
and do some baseball.

01:18:01.277 --> 01:18:03.377
Good ol' American baseball.

01:18:03.379 --> 01:18:05.079
What do you
think, sheriff?

01:18:05.081 --> 01:18:06.681
- Wait-

01:21:50.907 --> 01:21:53.507
- hey bud.

01:22:03.418 --> 01:22:06.487
Where you going?

01:22:07.355 --> 01:22:09.123
Come on,
have a drink.

01:22:13.194 --> 01:22:14.428
Run!

01:22:16.932 --> 01:22:19.233
Run!

01:22:21.469 --> 01:22:24.004
Run!

01:22:46.462 --> 01:22:48.095
- That hurts, doesn't it?

01:23:17.192 --> 01:23:18.225
- You know what?

01:23:18.227 --> 01:23:21.061
You're a real fun guy.

01:23:21.063 --> 01:23:23.197
We should hang out
more often.

01:23:23.199 --> 01:23:24.264
Say cheese!

01:23:31.106 --> 01:23:31.105
I told you there was
a light at

01:23:31.107 --> 01:23:35.075
the end of the tunnel,
didn't I motherfucker?

01:23:43.685 --> 01:23:45.586
The last time I was
down here I was

01:23:45.588 --> 01:23:47.621
the one being hunted.

01:23:47.623 --> 01:23:49.456
The place looks
great, doesn't it?

01:23:55.163 --> 01:23:57.031
Drink up, bud.

01:24:19.821 --> 01:24:21.121
Cigarette?

01:24:43.144 --> 01:24:45.412
- Cheers, bud.

01:28:02.410 --> 01:28:03.910
- Tequila.

01:28:03.912 --> 01:28:06.580
This gringo is wasted.

01:28:08.717 --> 01:28:10.384
Tequila.
