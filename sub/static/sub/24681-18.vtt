<i>In New York City's
war on crime,</i>

00:04.318 --> 00:06.479
<i>the worst criminal offenders
are pursued</i>

00:06.553 --> 00:09.249
<i>by the detectives
of the Major Case Squad.</i>

00:09.323 --> 00:11.086
<i>These are their stories.</i>

00:13.627 --> 00:14.855
Hi, honey.
Hi.

00:14.928 --> 00:15.952
How was your day?

00:16.029 --> 00:17.553
Hideous, as usual.

00:17.631 --> 00:19.622
Still having trouble
with that new teacher?

00:19.700 --> 00:21.668
I'm having trouble
with all my classes.

00:21.735 --> 00:25.000
If only Dad had let me
go to a real music school.

00:25.072 --> 00:27.370
You'll feel better
after you eat something.

00:27.441 --> 00:29.875
I'm making your favorite, lasagna.

00:30.844 --> 00:33.278
I'll be in my room
writing my will.

00:33.747 --> 00:35.840
Make sure you spell
my name correctly.

00:36.783 --> 00:39.081
<i>I just worry
so much about you.</i>

00:39.486 --> 00:41.010
<i>I don't want
anything bad to happen.</i>

00:41.088 --> 00:43.113
Hey,
where's my best girl?

00:47.427 --> 00:50.487
Come on, mopey, sit out
here with your old man,

00:50.564 --> 00:51.997
watch the game?

00:55.035 --> 00:57.560
I just wish she wouldn't leave messages.

00:57.637 --> 00:59.298
What if my parents
find out?

01:00.273 --> 01:01.535
About us?

01:03.777 --> 01:06.075
Would it really be
the end of the world?

01:08.248 --> 01:12.309
Just give it time.
It'll work itself out.

01:14.955 --> 01:19.892
Here, I had them order
this one especially for you.

01:26.400 --> 01:29.267
I didn't drive eight hours so
you can stare a hole in the trunk.

01:29.336 --> 01:30.735
This guy doesn't
want a cannon.

01:30.804 --> 01:31.964
Then here.

01:38.378 --> 01:39.504
He said
there's neighbors.

01:46.253 --> 01:48.448
What are you doing snooping
around in my room, anyway?

01:48.522 --> 01:50.581
Don't you know what kind of
danger you're putting us in?

01:50.657 --> 01:52.522
Me? This is all your fault!
Our fault?

01:52.592 --> 01:54.059
Give me that!
You little brat!

01:54.127 --> 01:55.321
Dennis!

01:55.929 --> 01:57.590
You're such a jerk!

01:57.664 --> 01:59.188
Rachel, wait!

02:02.936 --> 02:06.337
Well, I'm glad
I let you handle it.

02:08.675 --> 02:13.476
She thinks I don't feel guilty,
I do. I know what I've done.

02:13.914 --> 02:17.145
You can't keep treating her like a baby.

02:19.419 --> 02:21.080
There she is.

02:21.154 --> 02:23.315
Now try
and make nice.

02:24.991 --> 02:30.156
Honey? Come in here, please.
I want to apologize.

02:34.067 --> 02:35.364
Rachel?

02:39.806 --> 02:43.139
It's that girl from next door,
the Coburns. What's her name?

02:43.210 --> 02:44.268
Rachel.

02:47.514 --> 02:49.948
Rachel. Are you okay?

02:51.284 --> 02:55.345
In the house, they're dead. My parents.

03:46.072 --> 03:49.064
The daughter came home from a
late class, found them like this.

03:49.142 --> 03:51.576
No forced entry. Front and
back doors still locked.

03:51.645 --> 03:54.113
Daughter said the family used the
door from the garage to get in and out.

03:54.180 --> 03:55.511
Figure that's how
the hitter got in.

03:55.582 --> 03:56.844
Hitters.

03:57.751 --> 03:59.241
Two, probably.

03:59.719 --> 04:01.949
Mr. Burnett was shot
from the back.

04:02.022 --> 04:03.819
Now, if there was
a single gunman,

04:03.890 --> 04:05.585
Mrs. Burnett would've had
time to move out of the way

04:05.659 --> 04:07.889
while he
repositioned himself.

04:09.262 --> 04:11.321
How long were they
in Witness Protection?

04:11.398 --> 04:15.300
Two years. Burnett was
a gold merchant in Buffalo.

04:15.368 --> 04:17.836
One of our drug gangs,
the Marinkos,

04:17.904 --> 04:19.701
wanted him
to launder their money.

04:19.773 --> 04:21.536
We set up a sting.

04:21.608 --> 04:25.100
Thanks to Mr. Burnett, two of the
Marinko brothers are doing 20-to-life.

04:25.178 --> 04:26.975
Their case
is up for appeal?

04:27.047 --> 04:28.742
Up for review
next month.

04:29.149 --> 04:30.810
We might've
needed Burnett.

04:30.884 --> 04:31.908
You've been
in touch with him?

04:31.985 --> 04:34.283
He mention any unusual
activity, visitors?

04:34.354 --> 04:36.822
No. He called me this morning,
but I was tied up in court.

04:37.991 --> 04:39.925
Dennis did everything he
could to protect his family.

04:39.993 --> 04:41.483
These were
brave people.

04:55.008 --> 04:56.305
The TV doesn't
drown it out.

04:56.376 --> 04:59.243
They probably thought it was
their daughter. Busy people.

04:59.312 --> 05:03.305
They have activities four nights
a week. Bridge club, concerts...

05:03.850 --> 05:05.010
China.

05:11.091 --> 05:13.389
Looks like someone
dropped a plate.

05:14.694 --> 05:17.026
We need a work-up of everything
that's in here, please.

05:17.097 --> 05:19.588
The shooters learned
the Burnetts' schedule.

05:19.666 --> 05:21.258
Somebody watched
the house?

05:21.334 --> 05:24.360
Or somebody was already
familiar with it.

05:28.842 --> 05:31.106
Did your parents
make any new friends?

05:31.177 --> 05:33.441
My parents didn't need
friends, they had each other.

05:33.513 --> 05:36.004
How about old friends
up in Buffalo?

05:36.082 --> 05:37.572
You or your parents
been in touch?

05:37.651 --> 05:40.176
Don't you know anything?
We weren't allowed to.

05:45.058 --> 05:47.618
It's been hard.
Giving up your life.

05:49.229 --> 05:52.892
You play an instrument? Your
bracelet, the charms are all musical.

05:53.199 --> 05:57.898
I sing. I'm a music major
at the local loser college.

05:57.971 --> 06:01.134
Well, I'm sure that there's new
people there for you to meet.

06:01.207 --> 06:03.266
I made an effort
not to meet them.

06:03.343 --> 06:05.038
Strangers made
Dad nervous.

06:06.079 --> 06:08.240
Why aren't you out busting the
Marinkos, instead of talking to me?

06:08.314 --> 06:10.077
Everyone knows
they did it.

06:10.150 --> 06:11.879
We need to figure out
how they found you.

06:11.951 --> 06:14.442
I don't know.
I don't know.

06:15.288 --> 06:18.052
Rachel, there was a plate in
the garbage in the kitchen.

06:18.124 --> 06:19.250
Do you know
how it got broken?

06:19.325 --> 06:20.690
No. I was at
school all day.

06:20.760 --> 06:22.660
How long do I
have to stay here?

06:22.729 --> 06:24.663
Until we're sure
you're safe.

06:28.201 --> 06:31.762
She doesn't know whether to grieve
for her parents or blame them.

06:31.838 --> 06:33.772
What she didn't do
is blame herself.

06:33.840 --> 06:37.742
You know, "If I'd only been at home,
if I'd only been more vigilant. "

06:37.811 --> 06:40.974
Maybe because she knows it
won't bring her parents back.

06:42.315 --> 06:45.614
Or it might invite questions
that she's not ready to answer.

06:46.786 --> 06:48.754
The guns used to kill the
Burnetts were from Buffalo.

06:48.822 --> 06:50.380
A 9-mil and a. 22.

06:50.457 --> 06:53.358
The slugs were matched to two
robberies up there last year.

06:53.426 --> 06:55.690
Hitters from Buffalo. That puts
it in the Marinkos' ballpark.

06:55.762 --> 06:56.990
They would've
needed a spotter,

06:57.063 --> 06:58.758
somebody local,
to case the house.

06:58.832 --> 07:01.357
And how to get in. The
hitters knew what door to use,

07:01.434 --> 07:04.028
and where the Burnetts
would've been sitting.

07:04.104 --> 07:05.503
Someone who got to
know the family.

07:05.572 --> 07:06.766
Or a member of it.

07:06.840 --> 07:09.638
Maybe that's what Burnett's call
to the Buffalo D.A. Was about.

07:09.709 --> 07:12.200
He found someone in his
world who didn't belong.

07:12.278 --> 07:13.438
What did Burnett
do for a living?

07:13.513 --> 07:15.538
Retired. Lots of money in the bank.

07:15.615 --> 07:18.880
Mostly, they played
cards, went to concerts...

07:18.952 --> 07:22.046
Start working the phone
records, the daughter included.

07:23.690 --> 07:26.420
I have your soda, Rachel.
I'm setting it down out here.

07:26.493 --> 07:27.755
Thanks!

07:29.429 --> 07:31.954
I can't help thinking
if I hadn't...

07:32.365 --> 07:34.458
No, I'm not sorry,
but I...

07:37.504 --> 07:39.404
Please don't get angry.

07:40.140 --> 07:42.768
I couldn't stand it
if I lost you, too.

07:47.614 --> 07:51.106
The Burnetts did the same things
last week they did the weeks before,

07:51.184 --> 07:54.119
called the same numbers,
paid the same bills.

07:54.621 --> 07:56.020
New cheese?

07:56.089 --> 07:59.786
It's the contents of the trash
from the Burnetts' kitchen.

07:59.859 --> 08:04.159
Minus three boiled eggs, three grapefruit
halves, toast and coffee grounds.

08:04.230 --> 08:06.425
The Burnett family breakfast.

08:07.000 --> 08:09.628
The broken plate,
with traces of yolk.

08:11.905 --> 08:15.432
Paper napkins,
grocery list...

08:20.013 --> 08:21.981
Torn piece
of a picture.

08:22.515 --> 08:26.542
Latent found both Rachel and
Dennis Burnett's fingerprints on it.

08:27.387 --> 08:29.252
It's the left
arm of a man.

08:31.357 --> 08:33.484
Older man,
his hand is old.

08:35.495 --> 08:40.523
Gold wedding band, older-model
watch, sapphire cufflinks.

08:41.267 --> 08:43.962
Burnett had his watch
on his right arm.

08:46.139 --> 08:47.606
Broken plate,

08:50.310 --> 08:52.676
two sets of prints
on a torn picture.

08:52.745 --> 08:55.009
What do father and
daughters argue about?

08:55.081 --> 08:58.380
Boyfriends. Especially an
older, married boyfriend.

08:58.551 --> 09:00.712
Burnett must've
been thrilled.

09:00.787 --> 09:03.278
Thrilled enough to
call the Buffalo D.A.

09:05.258 --> 09:07.954
This could be the leak
to the Marinkos.

09:09.195 --> 09:10.594
We lost her.

09:10.897 --> 09:13.525
The girl went out her bedroom
window and jumped down to a dumpster

09:13.600 --> 09:14.760
about 20 minutes ago.

09:14.834 --> 09:17.632
Great, out the window,
and down the rabbit hole.

09:18.271 --> 09:20.398
After a rabbit
with sapphire cufflinks.

09:23.610 --> 09:25.168
She had
help escaping.

09:25.245 --> 09:27.713
The dumpster was pushed
into place under the window.

09:27.780 --> 09:28.804
What'd you get
off her cell phone?

09:28.882 --> 09:30.577
Lots of calls
to a no-name cell,

09:30.650 --> 09:32.845
the cheating man's
best friend.

09:33.386 --> 09:36.150
If this guy was using the
girl to get to her parents,

09:36.222 --> 09:39.350
he might've just told her he was
married to keep her mouth shut.

09:39.993 --> 09:42.962
Well, she was isolated.
She was angry,

09:43.029 --> 09:47.830
susceptible to the attentions
of a thoughtful stranger.

09:49.202 --> 09:51.227
Especially one
bearing gifts.

09:52.839 --> 09:54.363
This is a box
for a bracelet.

09:54.440 --> 09:59.434
She was wearing a new bracelet,
one with musical charms.

09:59.545 --> 10:02.275
This box is from
a no-name jewelry store.

10:02.715 --> 10:06.481
He might've bought it at the
mall where this picture was taken.

10:06.552 --> 10:10.511
I like their tables, red
frogs, pink squirrels.

10:10.590 --> 10:13.320
Can't be a lot of malls
with tables like that.

10:17.297 --> 10:21.165
I remember these cufflinks.
Sapphires on platinum.

10:21.834 --> 10:24.132
It's Trevor. I don't know his last name.

10:24.203 --> 10:26.933
Could you dig up a credit
card receipt for the bracelet?

10:27.006 --> 10:28.200
He paid cash.

10:28.274 --> 10:31.175
He buys a charm every week
or two, since five months ago.

10:31.244 --> 10:34.179
He ever come in with
anybody? A young woman?

10:34.580 --> 10:36.172
Well, no,
of course not.

10:38.785 --> 10:41.447
No, of course not. But
he was flirting with you.

10:41.521 --> 10:45.548
He's that type, charming, very
smart. He can talk on any subject.

10:45.625 --> 10:49.117
Oh, one of those. What
subjects did he talk about?

10:49.195 --> 10:51.686
Well, he told me about an
exposé on freshwater pearls

10:51.764 --> 10:55.029
<i>that was coming out in CITY
magazine. It saved us a lot of money.</i>

10:55.101 --> 10:57.160
He knew about the article
before it was published?

10:57.236 --> 10:58.863
What, does he work
at the magazine?

10:58.938 --> 11:01.736
I don't know. I wouldn't
be surprised if he owned it.

11:01.808 --> 11:03.139
Excuse me.

11:05.211 --> 11:07.179
There's a newsstand
a few doors down.

11:07.246 --> 11:08.679
We could pick up
the magazine,

11:08.748 --> 11:10.613
check the masthead
for a Trevor.

11:11.150 --> 11:14.244
You know, he's been buying
Rachel jewelry for five months.

11:14.320 --> 11:16.845
If this is just about
finding her parents,

11:16.923 --> 11:19.084
he wouldn't need to keep
up the charade for so long.

11:19.158 --> 11:21.285
There might be a real
relationship here.

11:22.161 --> 11:24.095
I can't believe
you did this!

11:24.163 --> 11:25.824
It has nothing
to do with you!

11:25.898 --> 11:28.230
It has everything
to do with us!

11:28.434 --> 11:29.594
God! You and your
damn secrets!

11:29.669 --> 11:30.727
I told you to
stay out of it!

11:30.803 --> 11:32.794
Look what you've turned
me into! Look what...

11:37.744 --> 11:39.871
Mr. And Mrs. Lipton,
it's the police.

11:39.946 --> 11:41.379
Yes, coming!

11:46.853 --> 11:47.877
Trevor Lipton?

11:47.954 --> 11:49.615
Yes.

11:49.689 --> 11:53.147
I'm Detective Eames. This is
Detective Goren. May we come in?

11:53.626 --> 11:54.991
Of course.

12:02.135 --> 12:03.193
Hello.

12:03.269 --> 12:05.533
So how
may we help you?

12:06.039 --> 12:07.438
A lot of dirt
on your floor.

12:07.507 --> 12:08.838
Did you knock
the plant over?

12:08.908 --> 12:11.672
No. That was me.
I bumped into it.

12:12.145 --> 12:14.409
Are you fighting,
Mrs. Lipton?

12:15.114 --> 12:17.048
It was hardly a fight.

12:18.518 --> 12:19.780
Did the neighbors
upstairs call?

12:19.852 --> 12:20.876
Oh, God.

12:20.953 --> 12:23.217
No, it's just
so embarrassing.

12:25.591 --> 12:29.322
You got blood on your hand.
Yeah, saw it when you were...

12:30.897 --> 12:32.831
Gash on the back
of your head, here?

12:32.899 --> 12:34.560
Let me have a look.

12:34.634 --> 12:35.692
No, no, it's fine.

12:35.768 --> 12:39.568
No, no. It's not good. Can
I help you clean that up?

12:39.939 --> 12:42.965
You wanna show me where
the bathroom is? Come on.

12:43.042 --> 12:44.566
All right. This way.

12:44.644 --> 12:45.941
I'm just gonna...

12:51.084 --> 12:53.575
How did your husband
hurt his head?

12:57.123 --> 12:59.614
Okay. I threw something.

13:00.226 --> 13:02.456
An ashtray.
I lost my temper.

13:02.628 --> 13:04.619
I've been under
a lot of pressure.

13:04.697 --> 13:07.291
My caseload.
I'm a social worker.

13:08.301 --> 13:10.428
You know, Mrs. Lipton,

13:10.503 --> 13:15.372
most of the domestic fights
we see are about sex or money.

13:16.008 --> 13:17.873
I just lost my temper.

13:18.211 --> 13:20.338
You have
a very nice apartment.

13:20.413 --> 13:22.472
It must be expensive
to keep up.

13:22.548 --> 13:25.540
It was a wedding present
from my father. It's paid for.

13:25.618 --> 13:27.813
Well, still,
a social worker's salary,

13:27.887 --> 13:31.084
and your husband's a
fact-checker at a magazine...

13:31.324 --> 13:33.315
There's money
from my parents.

13:33.392 --> 13:34.552
Well, if it's
not about money,

13:34.627 --> 13:36.891
then it must be
another woman.

13:41.567 --> 13:42.625
Excuse me.

13:42.702 --> 13:46.468
Well, she's unhappy with her
job and she takes it out on me.

13:46.539 --> 13:48.370
She knows it,
and I know it.

13:48.441 --> 13:50.773
The two of you
have a nice life.

13:51.444 --> 13:53.639
Who plays guitar?
Sorry.

13:53.713 --> 13:56.443
I'm teaching myself
how to play flamenco.

13:57.150 --> 13:59.141
Songs of love and torment.

14:00.786 --> 14:03.721
Is that where you met
Rachel, in music class?

14:04.056 --> 14:05.114
Who?

14:05.791 --> 14:07.816
Sorry, just
keep pressing.

14:08.327 --> 14:11.023
Your office said
that you skip out

14:11.097 --> 14:13.565
a couple of times
a week...

14:15.434 --> 14:18.369
Sorry, I thought... I
thought this was about noise.

14:19.405 --> 14:22.704
No, it's about
Rachel Coburn,

14:22.775 --> 14:25.437
the girl you spend
your afternoons with.

14:25.878 --> 14:27.505
She went missing.
Did you know that?

14:27.580 --> 14:29.480
I don't even know
who she is.

14:33.186 --> 14:36.417
I think that you do.

14:38.591 --> 14:42.083
'Cause when I mentioned her
name, your pulse went up.

14:43.396 --> 14:47.958
But when I said that she was
missing, you didn't skip a beat.

14:48.134 --> 14:50.034
So, I don't think
it's news to you.

14:53.539 --> 14:56.201
My, my, a human polygraph.

15:01.647 --> 15:06.311
Mr. Lipton, lying to us won't
keep your girlfriend safe.

15:06.385 --> 15:07.909
My girlfriend?

15:08.354 --> 15:10.982
That's the problem
with you civil servants,

15:11.057 --> 15:13.685
you snoop around, you
don't care who you hurt.

15:14.594 --> 15:18.530
Leave my wife's briefcase
alone. Now, you can go.

15:18.598 --> 15:19.690
Nina!

15:21.300 --> 15:23.131
This thing looks like it's
been through a tug-of-war.

15:23.202 --> 15:24.499
Whatever they were
arguing about,

15:24.570 --> 15:26.731
it might have something to do with it.

15:27.006 --> 15:31.943
His wife's briefcase, civil
servants, the ones who snoop.

15:34.347 --> 15:36.281
Maybe he meant his wife.

15:40.820 --> 15:42.344
The rules against
searching our databases

15:42.421 --> 15:44.184
for personal reasons
are very strict.

15:44.257 --> 15:47.226
Nina's the last person I'd
expect to behave irresponsibly.

15:47.293 --> 15:49.284
You haven't seen her
with an ashtray.

15:49.362 --> 15:51.626
She ever complain
about problems at home?

15:51.697 --> 15:54.097
No. She's very devoted
to Trevor.

15:55.001 --> 15:58.937
You know, Nina doesn't have any
pictures of kids or grandkids.

15:59.005 --> 16:00.802
Nina doesn't
have any children.

16:00.873 --> 16:02.465
She has her hands full
with Trevor.

16:02.541 --> 16:05.442
Let me know if you find
any irregularities.

16:10.683 --> 16:13.948
Look what Nina did. She
pulled all the white baby girls

16:14.020 --> 16:17.148
named Rachel born in New
York City 20 years ago.

16:17.323 --> 16:20.383
She must've found out
Rachel's first name, age.

16:21.260 --> 16:24.821
The next step would be to find
the ones living in the area.

16:24.897 --> 16:27.422
Or you could hope your husband
doesn't clean out his pockets

16:27.500 --> 16:30.560
before tossing his clothes in
the hamper. What do you think?

16:30.636 --> 16:32.365
Trevor's love nest?

16:33.272 --> 16:36.605
No, I'm sorry, I don't
know a Rachel or a Trevor.

16:38.311 --> 16:40.108
How did
you get this address?

16:40.179 --> 16:42.613
From a social worker,
Nina Lipton.

16:43.082 --> 16:45.050
Any idea why she had it?

16:45.117 --> 16:48.609
No. I've never needed
a social worker.

16:50.856 --> 16:53.051
You're probably going to think
that I'm flirting with you,

16:53.125 --> 16:55.650
but you have
very distinctive eyes.

16:58.931 --> 17:01.058
I love these
old apartments.

17:01.701 --> 17:02.963
You know,
what do you call them?

17:03.035 --> 17:04.059
Rent-controlled?

17:04.136 --> 17:09.574
No. Railroad apartments. Because
they look like railway cars.

17:10.810 --> 17:12.835
You eat
a lot of health food?

17:14.547 --> 17:16.276
I watch what I eat.

17:16.816 --> 17:20.684
Yeah? So these cheese snacks,
here, they wouldn't be yours.

17:20.752 --> 17:23.744
The neighbor's kid. He was here
helping me move some things.

17:23.823 --> 17:27.315
This looks like it was just
opened. It needs a coaster.

17:28.560 --> 17:30.654
There's somebody
else here, isn't there?

17:30.730 --> 17:32.994
You know, somebody
who likes junk food.

17:33.065 --> 17:37.434
Don't go in there. There's no
one here. Now, please, leave.

17:37.503 --> 17:40.666
Ms. Curtis, we're looking
for a missing girl.

17:41.974 --> 17:46.070
If you don't wanna help us,
you can come downtown.

17:46.145 --> 17:49.876
Leave her alone.
I'm not missing.

17:51.684 --> 17:53.174
This is my mother.

17:54.653 --> 17:56.120
Your birth mother.

17:58.290 --> 18:00.053
She really does
have your eyes.

18:01.694 --> 18:05.858
I found a letter from my birth
mother, Maureen, six months ago.

18:06.599 --> 18:09.090
It was hidden in a box
in the garage.

18:09.168 --> 18:13.002
She had sent it through a lawyer to my
parents when we were still in Buffalo.

18:13.439 --> 18:14.906
Did you know
you were adopted?

18:14.974 --> 18:16.168
Yes.

18:16.275 --> 18:18.675
But my parents never
told me about the letter.

18:18.744 --> 18:21.372
And I didn't tell them
that I'd found it.

18:21.447 --> 18:23.915
I knew my dad
would've flipped out.

18:23.983 --> 18:27.419
I got in touch with Maureen, and
we started spending time together.

18:27.486 --> 18:29.613
Trevor is
your birth father?

18:30.222 --> 18:33.453
Yes. Maureen told me
that they'd had an affair

18:33.526 --> 18:35.926
20 years ago,
when she was my age.

18:36.729 --> 18:40.256
He was married, so...
But she wanted us to meet.

18:40.800 --> 18:43.428
Did Trevor ever talk to you
about his wife, Nina?

18:43.502 --> 18:46.096
He said she was
a very jealous person.

18:46.739 --> 18:48.468
He was afraid of
how she'd react

18:48.541 --> 18:50.668
if she ever
found out about me.

18:52.344 --> 18:54.904
Rachel, why didn't
you tell us about this?

18:54.980 --> 18:59.940
I was afraid that because I'd
contacted my birth parents,

19:00.820 --> 19:03.880
because I'd gone outside
the Witness program,

19:03.956 --> 19:07.084
that I screwed up,
and the Marinkos found us.

19:07.626 --> 19:09.787
That could very well
be true.

19:09.862 --> 19:10.851
You hardly know
these people.

19:10.930 --> 19:12.955
They're my birth parents.

19:13.732 --> 19:16.895
Did you tell them you
were in Witness Protection?

19:17.536 --> 19:18.867
It just came out.

19:18.938 --> 19:20.929
All right, I want you back at the hotel.

19:21.006 --> 19:22.234
I'm staying
with Maureen.

19:22.308 --> 19:23.332
Not till you're
out of danger...

19:23.409 --> 19:24.774
You're the reason
my parents are dead.

19:24.844 --> 19:25.970
You talked them
into testifying.

19:26.045 --> 19:28.809
Easy now. You can stay
with Ms. Curtis.

19:29.815 --> 19:32.283
We just need to know
where you are.

19:33.285 --> 19:34.616
We can go.

19:36.522 --> 19:37.887
I can't believe you're
just gonna let her go...

19:37.957 --> 19:40.482
We'll put a car
outside their place.

19:40.759 --> 19:42.283
Trevor's wife,

19:43.462 --> 19:47.228
maybe her snooping got the attention
of someone working for the Marinkos.

19:47.299 --> 19:48.994
How close did she actually
get to finding Rachel?

19:49.068 --> 19:52.868
Not sure. We have a dozen
boxes of material to go through.

19:52.938 --> 19:55.338
There's a great Chinese place off
Chatham that delivers till 2:00 a. m.

19:55.407 --> 19:56.601
I'll get you the menu.

19:56.675 --> 19:58.973
Midnight egg rolls,
can't wait.

20:02.515 --> 20:07.111
Hey. She stole our...
She stole our stapler.

20:07.386 --> 20:09.479
She... Maureen,
she stole our stapler.

20:09.555 --> 20:12.786
She steals. That's why she
has all those knickknacks.

20:14.860 --> 20:16.760
That's interesting, huh?

20:19.265 --> 20:20.596
Welcome home!

20:20.666 --> 20:23.157
Look who's here.
It's your dad!

20:23.736 --> 20:24.862
What smells
so good?

20:24.937 --> 20:28.634
I found a Sicilian
recipe for lasagna.

20:30.175 --> 20:32.109
Maureen told me
it was your favorite.

20:32.177 --> 20:33.303
Trevor.

20:33.379 --> 20:37.008
That was one of the last meals
Mrs. Burnett cooked for Rachel.

20:37.082 --> 20:40.677
I didn't know.
How thoughtless.

20:40.753 --> 20:42.448
Look, but never mind,
we'll go out.

20:42.521 --> 20:45.957
No, no. It's all right. I'm
fine, don't worry. Really.

20:46.525 --> 20:51.224
Well, at least you have your real
parents now. It's family night.

20:51.664 --> 20:55.156
Finally, after all these
years, your real family.

20:58.037 --> 21:04.499
Nina had this list hidden in a file
under "Out-of-Pocket Expenses. "

21:05.444 --> 21:07.742
Families on welfare
in Buffalo.

21:08.414 --> 21:10.279
Halfway
down the page.

21:11.083 --> 21:13.950
Dotty Valavero Marinko.

21:14.887 --> 21:18.618
Wife of Tommy Marinko, one of the
brothers that Burnett helped put inside.

21:18.691 --> 21:21.251
Nina downloaded
her address.

21:21.327 --> 21:23.761
Somehow, she figured out
Rachel and the Burnetts were

21:23.829 --> 21:26.320
in Witness Protection
and why.

21:26.398 --> 21:28.866
She would've noticed that
Rachel's social security number,

21:28.934 --> 21:32.700
the one that she got in Witness
Protection, was only two years old.

21:32.771 --> 21:37.174
Well, maybe she tipped Dotty Marinko
off to the Burnetts' whereabouts.

21:37.443 --> 21:40.970
She might've thought
if she blew their cover,

21:41.046 --> 21:44.311
the Burnetts would move away
and take Rachel with them.

21:44.383 --> 21:47.978
Getting rid of the woman that she
thought was her husband's girlfriend.

21:48.053 --> 21:50.385
She was trying to
save her marriage.

21:50.990 --> 21:52.787
Well, Trevor should
consider himself lucky

21:52.858 --> 21:55.588
he only got beamed
by an ashtray.

22:00.299 --> 22:03.166
I can't help you. The
family already hates me.

22:03.235 --> 22:05.760
If they think I said anything
to hurt Tommy's chances

22:05.838 --> 22:07.738
of getting out,
they'll kill my kids.

22:07.806 --> 22:10.434
Why don't they like you, Mrs. Marinko?

22:11.276 --> 22:13.904
Dotty never showed up
at Tommy's trial.

22:15.581 --> 22:17.048
They think
you're disloyal.

22:17.116 --> 22:19.209
Screw what they think. I
couldn't get a babysitter.

22:19.284 --> 22:21.878
We know you got a call from
a New York City payphone

22:21.954 --> 22:23.979
a week before
the Burnetts were killed.

22:24.056 --> 22:25.785
Don't try to say
it was a wrong number,

22:25.858 --> 22:27.849
because you talked
for two minutes.

22:27.926 --> 22:30.724
I guess you found a way to
prove your loyalty, Dotty.

22:30.796 --> 22:32.423
You helped them
murder two witnesses.

22:32.498 --> 22:35.956
That's a lie. I never said
anything about it to the family.

22:36.035 --> 22:37.400
Who called?

22:40.305 --> 22:42.136
Sounded like
a white lady.

22:42.307 --> 22:45.037
All she said was that the Burnetts
were living in New York City,

22:45.110 --> 22:47.635
in Queens, in a nice
neighborhood with their kid.

22:47.713 --> 22:49.681
That's it?
No address?

22:49.748 --> 22:51.613
No. I thought
it was a joke.

22:52.217 --> 22:53.946
So funny that you
just had to tell Tommy.

22:54.019 --> 22:58.581
I never did. I swear. I
wouldn't. I didn't tell anybody.

22:58.657 --> 23:00.852
You don't mind
that he's in prison?

23:00.926 --> 23:02.917
You don't mind
if he never gets out?

23:02.995 --> 23:04.553
He's an animal.

23:05.164 --> 23:08.099
Look, I'm trying to give
my kids a chance at a life.

23:08.600 --> 23:10.397
And if he gets out...

23:13.939 --> 23:17.067
She's lying. She knows
what they'll do to her

23:17.142 --> 23:19.133
if they find out she
sat on that information.

23:19.211 --> 23:20.974
She told Tommy.

23:21.313 --> 23:22.507
Maybe.

23:22.881 --> 23:24.849
I want you to file charges against him.

23:24.917 --> 23:26.544
If his conviction is
overturned, he'll walk.

23:26.618 --> 23:29.212
I want to nail his feet to the
ground with two counts of murder one.

23:29.288 --> 23:30.346
On what evidence?

23:30.422 --> 23:31.980
You charge him now.

23:32.057 --> 23:33.684
I'll supply
the evidence later.

23:33.759 --> 23:37.286
In our part of the state, it
works the other way around.

23:37.896 --> 23:39.659
Nice talking to you.

23:49.041 --> 23:50.702
That man's an ass.

23:51.477 --> 23:54.810
He demanded I charge Tommy
Marinko for the murders.

23:54.880 --> 23:57.747
He's convinced Mrs.
Marinko passed on the tip.

23:57.816 --> 24:00.114
Well, she must've
done it telepathically.

24:00.185 --> 24:03.154
The prison said Tommy's been
in solitary for the last month.

24:03.222 --> 24:04.382
No calls, no visitors.

24:04.456 --> 24:06.720
There are other family
members she could've talked to.

24:06.792 --> 24:10.284
She got the information a week
before the Burnetts were killed.

24:10.362 --> 24:11.795
No address,
just a neighborhood.

24:11.864 --> 24:14.594
That's not enough time to find
them, learn their schedule.

24:14.666 --> 24:17.692
Unless she's lying, and the
tip included the address.

24:17.770 --> 24:21.001
I don't think she lied about
giving her kids a chance at a life.

24:21.073 --> 24:25.601
Then maybe Dotty Marinko isn't
the only Marinko Nina called.

24:27.146 --> 24:31.173
Or maybe someone wants us to believe that
Nina blew the whistle on the Burnetts.

24:34.620 --> 24:37.521
No one knew what I was doing.
I didn't ask for anyone's help.

24:37.589 --> 24:40.752
Did Trevor know that you
were looking for Rachel?

24:41.326 --> 24:43.988
He wouldn't tell me who she
was. Him and his secrets.

24:44.062 --> 24:46.121
He should've
expected me to look.

24:46.198 --> 24:48.894
The day we came over, that's
what the fight was about?

24:50.369 --> 24:54.169
He accused me of somehow
causing her parents' deaths,

24:54.239 --> 24:56.298
because of what he
called "my snooping. "

24:56.375 --> 24:59.242
This list of girls
named Rachel...

25:00.012 --> 25:02.503
Yeah, all I had
was her first name...

25:02.581 --> 25:03.878
And her age.

25:03.949 --> 25:05.917
It must've made you mad.

25:06.251 --> 25:08.116
I knew they
weren't lovers.

25:08.187 --> 25:10.178
I overheard him
on the phone with her.

25:10.255 --> 25:13.656
The way he spoke to her, I
knew she was his daughter.

25:13.926 --> 25:18.226
Well, her year of birth,
I mean, was it a guess?

25:18.864 --> 25:22.425
Or had you known that Trevor
was having an affair back then?

25:22.501 --> 25:25.334
A very serious affair.
I almost lost him.

25:26.672 --> 25:31.166
I didn't know the woman, and I certainly
didn't know there'd been a child.

25:31.510 --> 25:34.104
When you got married,
did Trevor want kids?

25:34.179 --> 25:39.310
No. My father used to say Trevor
was too immature to raise children.

25:40.252 --> 25:43.153
Doesn't sound like
he was a fan of Trevor's.

25:43.355 --> 25:46.552
When my father died, Trevor took over
my dad's sports equipment company.

25:46.625 --> 25:50.117
He had ideas for new games, new sports.

25:50.195 --> 25:52.993
And, I mean, it drove the
company out of business,

25:53.065 --> 25:56.228
but Trevor was so wonderfully creative.

25:56.702 --> 26:01.036
This address,
you found it where?

26:01.106 --> 26:03.199
In Trevor's
shirt pocket.

26:03.675 --> 26:06.337
What were you going to do
if you found Rachel?

26:07.613 --> 26:09.604
I just wanted
to see her.

26:10.582 --> 26:12.743
I mean, now all Trevor
talks about is Rachel.

26:12.818 --> 26:15.810
How alike they are, how
much he wants to do for her.

26:17.422 --> 26:19.287
Do you recognize this?

26:19.691 --> 26:22.125
Welfare families
in Buffalo.

26:22.194 --> 26:24.594
I don't handle cases
in Buffalo.

26:24.663 --> 26:28.895
It was downloaded using this
access code at the top of the page.

26:30.669 --> 26:32.068
I have to...

26:37.743 --> 26:39.608
That's my access code.

26:40.078 --> 26:43.912
But I don't recognize the
print-out. Where did it come from?

26:44.516 --> 26:49.317
Well, when you work from home
and you're accessing databases

26:49.388 --> 26:53.586
on your computer, I mean, do you
look up the code on that card?

26:53.659 --> 26:56.253
I have to. Yeah, they
change it every six months,

26:56.328 --> 26:57.761
and I can never
remember it.

26:57.829 --> 26:59.194
Nina.

26:59.898 --> 27:01.627
Oh! Excuse me.

27:03.468 --> 27:06.562
Overheard phone calls,
scraps of paper in pockets...

27:06.638 --> 27:10.369
Trevor wasn't very creative about
keeping his secrets from her.

27:10.442 --> 27:11.739
He wasn't trying.

27:11.810 --> 27:15.302
He was fueling her
curiosity, making her frantic.

27:16.148 --> 27:19.845
He could've gotten her code
to download these names,

27:20.719 --> 27:23.085
then planted them
in the file.

27:23.155 --> 27:27.785
Setting her up to look like she sicced
the Marinkos on Rachel and the Burnetts.

27:30.262 --> 27:35.564
Maybe setting up Nina was
just the crowning touch.

27:49.081 --> 27:51.675
I think I was on this
ride at Disney World.

27:52.150 --> 27:57.452
It's the Burnetts' kitchen, as it
was the night that they were killed.

27:57.522 --> 27:59.217
The lights were out.

27:59.291 --> 28:02.283
The killers came
from the garage.

28:03.328 --> 28:04.317
Door squeaked.

28:04.396 --> 28:06.023
Which they
didn't expect.

28:06.098 --> 28:08.191
It made them
stop and wait.

28:10.535 --> 28:12.867
Wait in the dark
of the kitchen.

28:12.971 --> 28:16.338
While the Burnetts were in
the next room watching TV.

28:18.510 --> 28:20.910
They would have flattened
themselves against the counter

28:20.979 --> 28:23.573
to keep from being seen
from the den.

28:26.418 --> 28:28.818
They stood there,
steadying their nerves...

28:28.887 --> 28:31.219
Their eyes got
used to the dark.

28:31.823 --> 28:35.725
They started to see
detail of where they were.

28:49.074 --> 28:51.167
Half-eaten toast,
three grapefruit halves,

28:51.243 --> 28:54.440
shells from three soft-boiled
eggs, coffee grinds.

28:54.813 --> 28:56.280
That's what
was in the trash.

28:56.348 --> 28:58.509
The Burnett
family breakfast.

29:03.588 --> 29:05.249
There's three
coffee cups.

29:05.323 --> 29:07.883
There are three bowls
and only two eggcups.

29:11.296 --> 29:15.630
Dennis and Camille.
There's an eggcup missing.

29:15.934 --> 29:17.458
That's Maureen.

29:20.372 --> 29:22.602
She steals
when she's nervous.

29:24.042 --> 29:28.775
She stood there in the dark, and she
stole an eggcup to calm her nerves.

29:30.282 --> 29:32.477
It's Trevor and Maureen.
They shot the Burnetts.

29:32.551 --> 29:34.519
The plot sickens.

29:37.089 --> 29:40.252
She wants to buy a car,
new clothes.

29:40.826 --> 29:44.887
She's talking about moving
to Florida, South Beach.

29:44.963 --> 29:46.988
She can't do anything yet.

29:47.699 --> 29:49.667
She thinks
by next week.

29:50.735 --> 29:54.364
What are we going to do?
We can't let her go.

29:54.940 --> 29:56.202
We won't.

29:57.542 --> 30:03.037
Come on, darling, let's just
enjoy being Mommy and Daddy.

30:10.622 --> 30:13.489
Maureen could've been the
one who called Dotty Marinko.

30:13.558 --> 30:15.025
And who would've
put them up to this?

30:15.093 --> 30:16.958
Rachel is the one
with the most to gain.

30:17.028 --> 30:19.895
The Burnetts had a net worth
of nearly two million bucks.

30:19.965 --> 30:21.557
Rachel's
their only heir.

30:21.633 --> 30:23.123
Could she be
one of the shooters?

30:23.201 --> 30:26.193
CSU did a routine swab of
her hands for gunshot residue.

30:26.271 --> 30:28.296
The GSR test
was negative.

30:29.374 --> 30:33.242
Hard to believe this kid talked
two adults into committing murder.

30:33.311 --> 30:35.802
Well, Maureen
might be susceptible.

30:35.947 --> 30:39.508
Rachel may be the centerpiece for her
need to make things right in her life.

30:39.584 --> 30:40.608
Her need?

30:40.685 --> 30:41.743
Her compulsive stealing.

30:41.820 --> 30:44.152
She could be
acting out her anger,

30:44.222 --> 30:46.520
maybe at giving up
her baby 20 years ago.

30:46.591 --> 30:48.252
Maureen and Trevor.

30:49.194 --> 30:52.027
See what alibis they have
for the night of the killings.

30:54.466 --> 30:58.163
I was with Trevor. We met for
a drink to talk about Rachel.

30:58.236 --> 30:59.897
What about Rachel?

31:00.071 --> 31:02.301
She had called us,
very upset.

31:03.141 --> 31:05.109
Mr. Burnett had
found Trevor's photo,

31:05.177 --> 31:08.374
and we were trying to decide if it was
better for Rachel for us not to be involved

31:08.446 --> 31:09.879
in her life
at this time.

31:09.948 --> 31:12.849
You would've given her up, after
looking for her all these years?

31:12.918 --> 31:16.217
Yes, if it was
in her best interest.

31:16.421 --> 31:20.824
You were a runner. Is this
you in the Olympic trials?

31:20.892 --> 31:22.484
The Los Angeles
Olympics.

31:22.561 --> 31:25.291
I made the team, but I
didn't actually compete.

31:26.198 --> 31:31.534
Maureen, it concerns us that
Rachel seems to have recovered

31:31.603 --> 31:34.333
pretty quickly from
the Burnetts' death.

31:35.006 --> 31:36.974
We don't dwell
on the past.

31:37.042 --> 31:40.034
We're creating a whole
new life for ourselves.

31:41.346 --> 31:42.745
As a family?

31:43.481 --> 31:45.949
It's something
every woman dreams of.

31:46.284 --> 31:48.718
I always regretted
giving Rachel up.

31:49.988 --> 31:53.754
You know, we haven't been able to find
an official record of the adoption.

31:53.825 --> 31:57.192
That's because it was,
you know, under the table.

31:57.262 --> 31:59.162
A doctor arranged it all.

31:59.231 --> 32:01.426
This is you
and Edwin Moses.

32:01.533 --> 32:04.434
So, Trevor and you, you
met here at this store?

32:04.502 --> 32:06.766
Have you kept in touch over the years?

32:06.838 --> 32:08.738
No. Not at all.

32:09.975 --> 32:13.308
Did he send you that?
The rose.

32:13.378 --> 32:16.006
No. Rachel did.

32:17.048 --> 32:19.414
Jeez.
That's thoughtful.

32:19.484 --> 32:21.349
Edwin Moses
is a hero of mine.

32:21.419 --> 32:24.911
I was wondering if you could make
a photocopy for me or something.

32:24.990 --> 32:27.481
That's very nice of you.
Thank you.

32:30.629 --> 32:31.891
Eames...

32:37.369 --> 32:40.099
A lot of vases,
for a lot of roses.

32:42.107 --> 32:44.871
A single red rose,
love and fidelity.

32:46.311 --> 32:49.280
What every woman dreams of.
Attaboy, Trevor.

32:51.349 --> 32:52.611
She's never
been married.

32:52.684 --> 32:56.643
Looks like she's been waiting
for Trevor. A 20-year affair.

32:57.289 --> 32:59.519
Well, maybe they just haven't
found a way to be together.

32:59.591 --> 33:04.585
Maureen's personnel file shows
she quit the store in 1995.

33:04.663 --> 33:06.756
She came back
a year later.

33:07.365 --> 33:09.356
1995, Nina's father died.

33:11.036 --> 33:12.799
Trevor took over
the company.

33:14.205 --> 33:16.264
Maybe Maureen quit because she
thought that Trevor would have

33:16.341 --> 33:20.004
enough money of his own. They
could finally be together.

33:20.378 --> 33:22.778
A year later, the company
went into bankruptcy,

33:22.847 --> 33:25.748
and Maureen went back
to work at the store.

33:26.651 --> 33:29.848
It's all about money.
That's what kept them apart.

33:30.155 --> 33:32.988
And now they expect
Rachel to support them?

33:35.427 --> 33:37.725
She inherits
from the Burnetts.

33:38.029 --> 33:39.690
But if she dies...

33:41.066 --> 33:45.002
When Rachel was adopted, Maureen
gave up her parental rights,

33:45.070 --> 33:47.368
including
her right to inherit.

33:48.673 --> 33:50.402
That leaves Trevor.

33:50.909 --> 33:52.809
Because the adoption
was illegal,

33:52.877 --> 33:55.641
Trevor can argue he never
gave up his parental rights.

33:55.714 --> 34:00.344
So if anything happens to Rachel,
he inherits whatever she has.

34:01.152 --> 34:04.588
They killed her adoptive parents,
so she'd inherit their money.

34:04.656 --> 34:08.422
Trevor can't do anything until Rachel
actually has the Burnetts' money,

34:08.493 --> 34:12.485
and she won't have it until she has
the death certificate for the Burnetts.

34:12.563 --> 34:15.498
See what you can do to
hold up that certificate.

34:17.268 --> 34:18.996
I think
I'll take a walk.

34:19.504 --> 34:22.132
Gee, kid, you think
that's a good idea?

34:23.942 --> 34:26.034
The police said it was still dangerous.

34:26.110 --> 34:27.304
I'll be fine.

34:27.379 --> 34:29.870
Rachel, we'd feel a lot
better if you stayed in.

34:30.748 --> 34:33.775
Tomorrow we have a big
day, all that travel.

34:33.851 --> 34:37.447
Hey. Tell you what,
sweetheart, I brought my guitar.

34:37.522 --> 34:39.012
I'll play, you'll sing.

34:39.090 --> 34:40.351
That'll be fun.

34:40.425 --> 34:42.052
I'll make some tea.

34:48.565 --> 34:51.295
The Burnetts' bodies went
to Saint Michael's mortuary,

34:51.369 --> 34:53.428
where they were
cremated last night.

34:53.505 --> 34:56.838
The instructions specified the
ashes should be packed for travel

34:56.908 --> 34:58.808
and ready for pick-up
this afternoon.

34:58.877 --> 34:59.901
Packed for travel.

34:59.978 --> 35:01.639
Well, the Burnetts
are from Buffalo.

35:01.713 --> 35:03.305
It makes sense to bring
their ashes back there.

35:03.381 --> 35:06.407
Back to a town full of
potential murder suspects.

35:06.484 --> 35:08.076
If Rachel takes
a bullet up there,

35:08.153 --> 35:11.611
the Buffalo D.A. Will be more than
happy to pin it on the Marinkos.

35:13.758 --> 35:17.888
Well, there's one Marinko that can
help us put the blame where it belongs.

35:20.064 --> 35:22.658
I thought they'd have the ashes
ready for us when we arrived.

35:22.734 --> 35:23.792
That's what
they told me.

35:23.868 --> 35:24.892
Maureen, relax.

35:24.969 --> 35:27.028
The plane doesn't leave
for an hour and a half.

35:27.105 --> 35:29.471
There you are. We were
worried we missed you.

35:29.541 --> 35:31.441
We need to talk to you.

35:31.709 --> 35:34.007
I'm sorry.
This is not a good time.

35:34.078 --> 35:36.774
Rachel's here to pick up
Mr. And Mrs. Burnett's ashes.

35:36.848 --> 35:38.975
It's a very emotional
time for her.

35:39.050 --> 35:41.075
You're gonna bring
them to Buffalo?

35:41.319 --> 35:43.150
Well, it's the city
where they were born.

35:43.221 --> 35:44.916
It's the right thing
to do.

35:44.989 --> 35:47.150
You might want
to reconsider.

35:47.358 --> 35:48.655
No. Arrangements
have been made

35:48.726 --> 35:50.887
to inter the ashes in a
crypt tomorrow morning.

35:50.995 --> 35:52.360
Yeah.

35:52.430 --> 35:56.560
The Buffalo police intercepted
a phone call yesterday.

35:56.935 --> 35:58.129
Just...

35:59.537 --> 36:02.597
<i>It's Dotty. You gonna be
talking to Tommy later?</i>

36:02.674 --> 36:03.698
<i>Yeah.</i>

36:03.775 --> 36:06.938
<i>Tell him I got another
call, from a man this time.</i>

36:07.011 --> 36:10.845
<i>It's about the daughter. She's
bringing her parents' ashes home.</i>

36:10.915 --> 36:12.109
<i>Home.
You mean here?</i>

36:12.183 --> 36:15.619
<i>Yeah. The guy gave me the name of the
motel where she's gonna be staying.</i>

36:15.687 --> 36:19.714
<i>He said that son of a bitch D.A.
Thinks he can use her against Tommy.</i>

36:19.791 --> 36:21.656
Oh, my God, they're talking about me.

36:21.726 --> 36:25.492
That's Tommy Marinko's wife, Dotty,
and one of Tommy's associates.

36:25.563 --> 36:27.724
All right. So there's no question,
we have to cancel the trip.

36:27.799 --> 36:30.029
Sweetheart, I'm sorry,
it's just not safe.

36:30.101 --> 36:32.331
We're wondering how they
found out about your trip.

36:32.403 --> 36:35.099
Did you say anything
to anybody, Rachel?

36:35.206 --> 36:38.107
No. Dad told me
not to.

36:38.810 --> 36:40.744
Right. But, of course, Maureen
and I had to tell our work

36:40.812 --> 36:43.838
where we could be contacted, and I
told the people at the crypt in Buffalo.

36:43.915 --> 36:45.644
And I had to give them
Dennis and Camille's names.

36:45.717 --> 36:48.049
But how stupid of me. That's
probably how the word got out.

36:48.119 --> 36:49.609
Trevor, we should go.

36:49.687 --> 36:50.745
Of course.

36:50.822 --> 36:53.120
I can't leave
without the ashes.

36:53.224 --> 36:54.282
We'll get them.

36:54.359 --> 36:56.452
Well, while
we have you here,

36:56.528 --> 36:59.292
we were pulling together
the paperwork on the case.

36:59.364 --> 37:03.767
It was pointed out to us that Trevor
never signed away his parental rights

37:03.835 --> 37:05.700
when you were adopted.

37:06.771 --> 37:08.238
Well, no. I mean,
I was never asked to.

37:08.306 --> 37:11.469
Apparently, it's a
big, legal can of worms.

37:11.543 --> 37:13.135
We talked to somebody
at Family Court.

37:13.211 --> 37:16.180
They said Trevor should sign
a waiver as soon as possible.

37:16.247 --> 37:18.511
I'm sure
it's just a formality,

37:18.583 --> 37:20.312
and I'll deal with it
first thing Monday.

37:20.385 --> 37:21.647
Well, we can save
you the trouble.

37:21.719 --> 37:23.880
We happen to have
a waiver right here.

37:23.955 --> 37:26.480
Yeah, go ahead.
We can be witnesses.

37:26.958 --> 37:28.255
All right.

37:37.101 --> 37:38.659
You know, I feel...

37:38.736 --> 37:41.569
I mean, Rachel, are
you all right with this?

37:42.240 --> 37:44.970
I mean, I feel like
I'm abandoning you.

37:45.076 --> 37:48.204
It's just a legal paper.
It doesn't mean anything.

37:48.279 --> 37:50.008
No, but I... It occurs to me,
what I'm really doing here is

37:50.081 --> 37:52.777
I'm waiving your rights
as my daughter.

37:53.718 --> 37:56.186
I mean, if anything should
happen to me, then, you know,

37:56.254 --> 37:58.222
Rachel would not have
any claim to my estate.

37:58.289 --> 37:59.779
I couldn't pass
anything on to her.

37:59.857 --> 38:02.018
Unless you include her
in your will.

38:02.093 --> 38:04.960
Well, I can't do that,
because Nina would fight it.

38:05.997 --> 38:08.295
I'm sorry, Rachel. I think
that we should consult a lawyer

38:08.366 --> 38:10.095
before I sign this.

38:10.401 --> 38:13.029
We didn't really
expect him to sign it.

38:14.639 --> 38:17.335
The estate that Trevor
is worried about

38:19.410 --> 38:22.402
is the one that your
parents passed on to you.

38:22.947 --> 38:24.437
If anything
happens to you, Rachel,

38:24.515 --> 38:27.609
the money the Burnetts
left you goes to Trevor.

38:27.952 --> 38:29.817
I'm not so sure that
you're right about that.

38:29.887 --> 38:32.947
That's why they're taking you
to Buffalo, to get you killed.

38:33.024 --> 38:36.824
Trevor's the one who called
Dotty Marinko and tipped her off.

38:37.128 --> 38:39.824
That is an insane lie.

38:40.999 --> 38:42.864
Rachel, it's not true.

38:43.668 --> 38:46.034
These are my parents.
They love me.

38:46.104 --> 38:48.902
The only people that
they love is each other.

38:49.907 --> 38:52.603
Twenty years, they've
been sneaking around,

38:52.677 --> 38:54.770
trying to steal time
to be together.

38:55.780 --> 38:57.475
Rachel, now they have you.

38:57.548 --> 39:00.642
You're their ticket to a
life of connubial bliss.

39:00.718 --> 39:04.814
They killed your real parents,
Rachel, to make you rich.

39:06.958 --> 39:10.394
They were in the house that
night, and they shot them.

39:14.265 --> 39:18.793
We know, because Maureen
swiped your eggcup

39:20.571 --> 39:22.061
as a souvenir.

39:24.542 --> 39:25.600
Mom.

39:26.911 --> 39:28.003
That can't be true.

39:28.079 --> 39:30.274
Rachel.
None of this is true.

39:32.984 --> 39:34.849
Listen to
your heart, Rachel.

39:34.919 --> 39:36.784
The heart doesn't lie.

39:37.488 --> 39:39.854
You know we would
never hurt our baby.

39:41.025 --> 39:43.858
Ms. Burnett? I just need your signature.

39:46.164 --> 39:48.394
Yes. Let's take care
of this business.

39:49.600 --> 39:52.467
Is that really what
you believe, Maureen?

39:52.537 --> 39:55.335
That the heart,
it never lies?

39:55.406 --> 39:57.533
I mean,
even after 20 years?

39:57.975 --> 39:59.840
What? Excuse me, what
did you say to her?

39:59.911 --> 40:02.744
That, you know, a lot of
men, they fall in love.

40:02.814 --> 40:04.975
They leave their wives,
you know.

40:05.049 --> 40:06.346
Yeah?

40:06.417 --> 40:07.543
Why didn't he?

40:08.419 --> 40:10.979
Well, 'cause I had my
reasons. Maureen understood.

40:11.055 --> 40:13.546
Money? Money,
because money...

40:14.025 --> 40:16.220
Well, money is
important to Trevor.

40:16.294 --> 40:17.659
It's more important
than you.

40:17.729 --> 40:21.290
You don't know what you're
talking about. Trevor loves me.

40:21.365 --> 40:24.994
Maureen, look, the
tape's not finished yet.

40:26.037 --> 40:27.334
<i>There's another thing.</i>

40:27.405 --> 40:30.431
<i>The guy said the girl's gonna
be sharing a room with her aunt.</i>

40:30.508 --> 40:32.976
<i>He said this lady could
be a problem for Tommy,</i>

40:33.044 --> 40:35.444
<i>and you guys should
take care of her, too.</i>

40:35.513 --> 40:37.913
<i>Two for one.
I'll pass it on.</i>

40:39.484 --> 40:41.042
Two for one, Maureen.

40:41.185 --> 40:42.743
And two million
for Trevor.

40:43.054 --> 40:45.420
He's the one who called
Dotty to tip her off.

40:45.490 --> 40:48.288
That's ridiculous.
I never called her.

40:49.360 --> 40:50.884
Twenty years...

40:52.363 --> 40:54.695
Twenty years you've been
waiting for him,

40:55.099 --> 41:00.298
putting your existence on hold,
listening to his excuses...

41:00.905 --> 41:05.899
Maureen, you know that I love
you. You know I always have.

41:06.277 --> 41:08.871
You were going
to have me killed?

41:08.946 --> 41:12.712
Honey, that conversation, it's made up.

41:13.184 --> 41:16.051
No, it's Dotty Marinko
all right.

41:16.320 --> 41:19.255
You know what she sounds
like, don't you, Maureen?

41:20.224 --> 41:23.250
Yes. I talked to her,
remember?

41:24.562 --> 41:26.723
You told me to call her, to
tell her about the Burnetts.

41:26.798 --> 41:27.924
Maureen, shut up!

41:27.999 --> 41:29.660
Oh, my God, it's true.

41:30.635 --> 41:32.500
And it was all
Trevor's idea?

41:32.570 --> 41:36.097
Yes! The first day
he met Rachel,

41:36.340 --> 41:38.501
he found out
her parents had money.

41:38.576 --> 41:40.271
He found out
they were in hiding.

41:40.344 --> 41:42.244
He came up with the idea
to kill them.

41:42.313 --> 41:44.747
Maureen, what are you
talking about?

41:44.816 --> 41:46.647
It was his idea to get
the guns from Buffalo.

41:46.717 --> 41:48.378
His wife told us
he was creative.

41:48.452 --> 41:52.479
Maureen, you see, it was
her idea to kill Rachel.

41:52.824 --> 41:55.156
Yeah, her own daughter.
She was jealous of her.

41:55.226 --> 41:58.787
Imagine that.
Jealous of her own daughter!

41:59.030 --> 42:00.520
I saw how
you looked at her.

42:00.598 --> 42:03.590
I hadn't waited all these years
to share you with another woman!

42:03.668 --> 42:05.397
Well, your wait
is just beginning.

42:05.469 --> 42:07.130
You're under arrest
for murder.

42:07.205 --> 42:08.832
You, too, Trevor.

42:09.874 --> 42:13.332
You see what you've done?
Do you see what you've done?

42:13.411 --> 42:14.503
Don't talk to me!

42:14.579 --> 42:19.073
Because you couldn't keep
your hands off the damn eggcup!

42:21.319 --> 42:22.308
Get him out of here.

42:22.386 --> 42:23.580
Eggcup!

42:35.166 --> 42:37.066
We're gonna need to take
the bracelet for evidence.

42:37.134 --> 42:39.227
Take it.
Get it off me.

42:41.739 --> 42:45.004
I did this. I brought
these people into our lives.

42:47.378 --> 42:49.278
Well, you didn't
do anything wrong.

42:50.781 --> 42:55.514
Just like any child just wants to
know where... Where you came from.

43:03.561 --> 43:05.358
That's okay.
Okay?

43:06.130 --> 43:07.392
Let's go.
