WEBVTT

00:02.667 --> 00:04.767
(siren wailing)

00:11.810 --> 00:13.277
Both from gunshot,
one to the left mastoid,

00:13.344 --> 00:14.444
one to the
right thigh.

00:14.511 --> 00:15.578
Vitals? Crashed twice en route,

00:15.643 --> 00:16.944
but he's stable now,
barely.

00:17.010 --> 00:19.444
BP's 50 over palp.
Pulse is 48.

00:19.511 --> 00:23.244
(heart monitor flatlining)

00:26.810 --> 00:28.177
Cancel that. He just zeroed out.

00:29.044 --> 00:30.643
Paddles.
Charging.

00:33.877 --> 00:34.977
Clear!

00:35.044 --> 00:36.478
Clear.

00:42.111 --> 00:43.877
Nothing.

00:43.944 --> 00:45.111
Again!

00:46.810 --> 00:48.444
Clear!

00:50.177 --> 00:51.643
Still nothing.

00:57.244 --> 00:58.411
Again.

00:59.844 --> 01:01.877
CAINE:
She has five minutes left, Eric.

01:01.944 --> 01:03.111
DELKO:
H, maybe she's in there.

01:03.177 --> 01:04.742
(gunshots)

01:04.810 --> 01:07.111
(agonized groans)

01:07.177 --> 01:08.444
Eric?!

01:08.511 --> 01:09.677
(gunshots)

01:14.077 --> 01:15.844
(gunfire continues)

01:20.144 --> 01:22.211
Doctor.

01:22.277 --> 01:24.044
It's been
ten minutes.

01:24.111 --> 01:26.144
Doctor, shouldn't
we call it?

01:26.211 --> 01:29.277
(monitor flatlining)

01:29.344 --> 01:30.377
Doctor?

01:34.377 --> 01:36.610
Okay. Time...

01:36.677 --> 01:37.810
1:04 p.m.

01:37.877 --> 01:41.244
(monitor flatling)

02:27.927 --> 02:29.327
Calleigh.

02:29.393 --> 02:31.393
Dispatch said that Eric is
dead. What is going on?

02:31.460 --> 02:34.094
I don't know. I'm trying
to find out. Excuse me.

02:34.161 --> 02:36.494
Is there a place where we
can give blood to CSI Delko?

02:36.560 --> 02:38.660
Your friend's not going
to need that anymore.

02:40.260 --> 02:41.460
Are you saying he's dead?

02:41.527 --> 02:43.861
No, no. I mean, he's
lost too much blood.

02:43.927 --> 02:45.927
He's on plasma now to get
his volume up. I'm sorry.

02:45.994 --> 02:47.027
I don't understand.
Is he okay,

02:47.094 --> 02:48.161
or is he not okay?

02:48.228 --> 02:49.694
They're doing
everything they can.

02:49.761 --> 02:51.327
Excuse me, could we please
just get a straight answer?

02:51.393 --> 02:53.727
Professional
to professional.

02:54.727 --> 02:56.061
Okay.

02:56.128 --> 02:57.594
They've been trying
to resuscitate him

02:57.660 --> 02:59.260
for the last 11 minutes.

03:00.460 --> 03:02.161
If he doesn't respond
in the next five,

03:02.228 --> 03:04.061
they'll call it.

03:11.127 --> 03:13.594
(monitor flatlining)

03:17.060 --> 03:19.160
Give me an amp
of intercardiac epi.

03:35.427 --> 03:37.927
DOCTOR: Okay, let's
stabilize him and get a CT,

03:37.994 --> 03:39.561
then prep him for the OR.

03:39.628 --> 03:44.036
NURSE:
He's back.

05:18.694 --> 05:20.660
What do you want to do?

05:24.360 --> 05:25.961
Catch the guy.

05:40.493 --> 05:41.560
WOLFE:
Hey.

05:41.627 --> 05:43.027
They find that
girl yet?

05:43.094 --> 05:45.527
They find that court
stenographer, Cathy Gibson,

05:45.594 --> 05:47.878
because I really need
some good news.

05:47.913 --> 05:50.162
Natalia and Tripp
are working on it.

05:50.228 --> 05:51.562
Let's hope she's
still alive.

05:51.879 --> 05:54.011
.223 assault rifle
with an evidence tag on it,

05:54.078 --> 05:56.011
so it's definitely
from the gunmelt truck.

05:56.478 --> 05:57.812
The heist that keeps on giving.

05:57.878 --> 05:59.645
Let me ask you something.
How do we know that

05:59.711 --> 06:02.945
that guy and that gun didn't
put the bullet in Delko's head?

06:03.012 --> 06:06.279
H said the head shot happened
after that guy was dead.

06:06.344 --> 06:08.545
Also, Eric's wound
was consistent

06:08.611 --> 06:10.012
with a small
caliber weapon.

06:10.078 --> 06:11.279
Okay.

06:14.478 --> 06:16.878
It's a miracle
that Eric's still alive.

06:16.945 --> 06:18.778
Yeah.

06:18.845 --> 06:20.511
Horatio said

06:20.578 --> 06:22.279
the last shot
came from over there.

06:25.545 --> 06:27.411
Really?

06:47.128 --> 06:48.961
Calleigh!

06:50.362 --> 06:51.428
I got a GSR cone.

06:53.328 --> 06:56.295
The shooter used that car
to steady his aim.

06:56.312 --> 06:57.844
Isn't even a sniper shot.

07:02.694 --> 07:05.362
Yeah. He chose the car with
the best vantage point.

07:05.429 --> 07:07.462
Or maybe he created
a vantage point.

07:07.529 --> 07:08.828
Look at the way it's parked.

07:09.694 --> 07:10.795
Oh, yeah, you're right.

07:10.861 --> 07:12.362
It's taking up
two parking spots.

07:12.429 --> 07:13.728
Whoever owned this car

07:13.795 --> 07:16.395
made sure that they
had the front row seat.

07:16.462 --> 07:19.162
That's a front row seat
he'll be sorry he got.

07:19.228 --> 07:21.062
Let's go talk to him.

07:22.328 --> 07:24.561
You're a security guard
on the lot, right?

07:24.628 --> 07:26.761
Yeah. Which side do you wear

07:26.828 --> 07:27.928
your holster on?

07:27.995 --> 07:30.228
Uh... right. Why?

07:30.295 --> 07:33.795
Want to do me a favor...
uh, give me your right hand.

07:35.028 --> 07:36.594
DUQUESNE:
Why two parking spaces?

07:36.661 --> 07:38.162
I park that way so I don't
get my car scratched.

07:38.228 --> 07:40.328
That car's all I got.

07:40.395 --> 07:42.395
Shouldn't have even bought
the thing on my salary.

07:42.462 --> 07:45.462
What's this about? You were
working today, weren't you?

07:47.995 --> 07:50.062
Uh, yeah.

07:50.128 --> 07:52.128
Then you were there
for the shooting.

07:56.928 --> 07:58.262
No, negative.

07:58.328 --> 07:59.529
Were you there,

07:59.594 --> 08:01.594
Mr. Keeler?

08:01.661 --> 08:02.594
Kind of.

08:02.661 --> 08:04.328
Kind of?
What does that mean?

08:04.395 --> 08:07.328
Well, I was down on level
two when I heard the shots.

08:07.395 --> 08:09.661
I ran to help when
I see this guy,

08:09.728 --> 08:10.961
like, booking it
down the stairs.

08:13.928 --> 08:16.961
Did you, uh, did you get
a good look at this guy?

08:17.028 --> 08:19.594
Dark hair, I think,
medium build.

08:19.661 --> 08:21.495
Wearing a dark jacket
and a baseball cap.

08:21.561 --> 08:22.828
Why didn't you call it in?

08:22.895 --> 08:24.228
(sighs)

08:24.295 --> 08:26.262
I was embarrassed.

08:26.328 --> 08:29.795
The place hires an armed guard,
and I didn't do a thing.

08:29.861 --> 08:31.362
I'm sorry.

08:31.429 --> 08:33.760
I wish I could
have done more.

08:33.828 --> 08:35.062
I wish you would have.

08:35.128 --> 08:37.227
A CSI was shot.

08:47.062 --> 08:49.961
Any news on Eric?

08:50.028 --> 08:51.561
He's still critical.

08:51.628 --> 08:53.228
I swear to God,
when we find Clavo,

08:53.295 --> 08:55.395
it's going to be hard for me
not to pull the trigger myself.

08:55.462 --> 08:57.395
It's-it's all that
I can think about,

08:57.462 --> 08:58.961
but right now,
I've got to focus

08:59.028 --> 09:01.062
because Clavo's
still got a hostage.

09:01.128 --> 09:02.795
Yeah, Cathy Gibson,
court stenographer.

09:02.861 --> 09:04.761
We still got patrols out
looking for her.

09:04.828 --> 09:05.995
We'll find her.

09:06.062 --> 09:07.561
I think we just did.

09:09.895 --> 09:12.195
Horatio had

09:12.262 --> 09:14.395
the bank manager slip
a GPS locator in that money bag,

09:14.462 --> 09:17.628
didn't he? Yup, Clavo and
his bags are at the beach.

09:19.761 --> 09:21.694
Black Point.

09:21.761 --> 09:22.861
Let's go.

09:35.228 --> 09:36.628
The bag's here.

09:36.694 --> 09:37.995
Clavo's not.

09:38.062 --> 09:39.495
Hacked his
cuffs off.

09:43.694 --> 09:45.295
He left behind the GPS.

09:45.362 --> 09:46.928
That's not the only
thing he left behind.

09:46.995 --> 09:47.928
Natalia.

09:47.995 --> 09:49.761
Take a look at this.

09:52.462 --> 09:54.462
Let's go.

10:03.062 --> 10:04.295
(whimpering)

10:06.128 --> 10:08.162
(gasps, screams)

10:08.228 --> 10:10.162
Cathy.

10:10.228 --> 10:12.861
I'm Natalia, I'm with
Miami-Dade Police Department.

10:12.928 --> 10:14.095
It's okay,
you're safe now.

10:14.162 --> 10:15.095
Let's get
these restraints off.

10:17.594 --> 10:21.128
TRIPP: Is there anything you
can tell us about what happened?

10:21.195 --> 10:23.561
I was in the trunk for...

10:23.628 --> 10:25.362
I don't know,
forever, and...

10:25.429 --> 10:27.062
we stopped,
and then

10:27.128 --> 10:29.095
I heard him talking
to someone, and then

10:29.162 --> 10:30.728
they cut off his handcuffs.

10:30.795 --> 10:33.295
And then right after that,
they found the thing

10:33.362 --> 10:34.694
in the money, and he got

10:34.761 --> 10:37.028
so pissed, he said
he was going to kill me.

10:37.095 --> 10:39.895
And when he took me down
to the water, I thought...

10:39.961 --> 10:41.594
(sobbing)

10:44.295 --> 10:47.928
But then he just
tied me up and left.

10:47.995 --> 10:49.395
Okay.

10:49.462 --> 10:50.961
It's going to be all
right; you're safe now.

10:51.028 --> 10:52.611
We're going to get you
to the hospital,

10:52.628 --> 10:53.995
we're going to get you
cleaned up and taken care of,

10:54.062 --> 10:55.228
and then after that, can
we collect all your clothes

10:55.295 --> 10:56.928
and take some pictures
of your injuries?

10:56.995 --> 10:58.028
Yeah, of course.

10:59.362 --> 11:01.195
All right,
let's go.

11:01.262 --> 11:02.795
Here we go.
Oh.

11:02.861 --> 11:04.295
Can you walk?
Yeah.

11:04.362 --> 11:06.362
TRIPP:
Yeah?

11:14.895 --> 11:19.028
Have we finished
processing her yet?

11:19.095 --> 11:21.494
Yeah. Sort of.

11:21.561 --> 11:23.295
How do you mean?

11:23.362 --> 11:25.728
Cathy said that
Clavo assaulted her.

11:25.795 --> 11:29.095
Take a look at the picture
of her cuts.

11:32.128 --> 11:35.761
That's not a defensive
wound, is it?

11:35.828 --> 11:36.962
No, it's not.

11:37.028 --> 11:38.561
Do me a favor

11:38.628 --> 11:40.429
and run her most recent
court assignments.

11:40.494 --> 11:41.528
Will do.

11:43.295 --> 11:45.362
So how's the hand?

11:45.429 --> 11:47.628
Oh, the nurse put some stuff
on it.

11:47.695 --> 11:49.761
It feels better.
Good.

11:49.828 --> 11:51.461
Can I go home soon?

11:51.528 --> 11:54.095
No, you can't,
Miss Gibson.

11:54.162 --> 11:57.628
It turns out that you lied
to me about your hand.

11:57.695 --> 11:58.795
What?

11:58.861 --> 12:00.228
You got that cut

12:00.295 --> 12:02.861
removing Clavo's handcuffs,
didn't you?

12:09.494 --> 12:11.695
So you're not his victim.

12:11.761 --> 12:13.995
You're his accomplice.

12:14.062 --> 12:15.362
No. He kidnapped me.

12:15.429 --> 12:17.095
Miss Gibson,
we recovered

12:17.162 --> 12:19.395
the hacksaw
in your car.

12:19.461 --> 12:21.362
We can print it,
if you'd like,

12:21.429 --> 12:22.728
so why don't
you tell me

12:22.795 --> 12:24.861
what really happened?

12:27.429 --> 12:31.262
Whenever he was in court,

12:31.329 --> 12:33.362
he'd look at me.

12:33.429 --> 12:36.528
He was...

12:36.594 --> 12:41.828
He was polite and funny and...

12:41.895 --> 12:43.695
I don't know.

12:43.761 --> 12:45.128
We had a connection.

12:45.195 --> 12:47.528
That wasn't the only
connection she had.

12:47.594 --> 12:49.295
You work in the 21st
Criminal District court.

12:49.362 --> 12:51.295
Same one that signed off on the gunmelt.

12:51.362 --> 12:55.028
You knew the route
and the time.

12:55.095 --> 12:56.995
And you shared that
with Clavo, didn't you?

12:57.062 --> 12:59.995
His people killed cops
to get to that truck.

13:00.062 --> 13:01.262
They blew up the courthouse
to break him out.

13:01.329 --> 13:03.461
I didn't know
he was going to do that.

13:03.528 --> 13:05.195
I thought he was...
What did you think?

13:05.262 --> 13:07.128
You thought he was going to be
nice, with a whole truckload of guns?

13:07.195 --> 13:10.329
He said he would
take me to his country.

13:10.395 --> 13:12.661
We'd be royalty.

13:12.728 --> 13:16.362
Then he just left me
in the water to die.

13:16.429 --> 13:18.295
After all I did.

13:18.362 --> 13:20.861
We call that a confession.

13:20.928 --> 13:22.195
Oh, God.

13:22.262 --> 13:23.795
Miss Gibson,

13:23.861 --> 13:26.295
if my CSI dies, you're going
to be charged with murder.

13:26.362 --> 13:30.761
It's all your fault, you know.

13:32.528 --> 13:35.661
You made his father turn on him.

13:35.728 --> 13:38.128
Made him hate his own father.

13:38.195 --> 13:39.661
We ran the DNA, General,

13:39.728 --> 13:42.494
and it turns out
that Clavo

13:42.561 --> 13:44.461
and his brother...

13:45.528 --> 13:46.962
.. have different fathers.

13:47.028 --> 13:48.162
I need to remind you now

13:48.228 --> 13:49.329
you have the power

13:49.395 --> 13:51.195
to rescind his immunity
at any time.

13:52.528 --> 13:54.461
Rescind it.

13:55.362 --> 13:57.494
You ruined his life.

13:57.561 --> 14:04.228
Miss Gibson, Clavo is a big boy
who ruined his own life.

14:04.295 --> 14:06.528
He's a killer

14:06.594 --> 14:08.195
who brought this
on himself.

14:20.688 --> 14:22.089
Horatio,

14:22.155 --> 14:25.588
I tracked down Clavo's
father, General Cruz.

14:25.655 --> 14:28.155
Turns out he is in town
since yesterday.

14:28.222 --> 14:29.955
You going to tell me
what this is all about?

14:30.022 --> 14:31.421
This is about revenge, Frank.

14:31.488 --> 14:32.822
That's what Clavo's after.

14:32.889 --> 14:34.289
You think the
general's in trouble?

14:34.356 --> 14:35.989
I do.

14:45.488 --> 14:48.256
Well, this is odd.

14:48.322 --> 14:50.289
TRIPP: Where's all the security?

14:50.356 --> 14:55.555
Yes. Maybe the general
has company, Frank.

14:58.455 --> 15:00.022
Frank, have your men
cover the exits,

15:00.039 --> 15:01.772
and I will go
through the front.

15:04.038 --> 15:06.072
CLAVO: So glad I found you, Pop.

15:06.138 --> 15:08.771
TRIPP: Horatio, I'll cover the rear.

15:08.838 --> 15:12.172
Now, stay right there so
we can have a little talk.

15:12.239 --> 15:14.272
How do you do that, huh?

15:14.339 --> 15:16.405
How do you just
disown me like that?

15:16.472 --> 15:17.972
It was my only choice.

15:18.038 --> 15:20.339
That was your choice, huh?
To turn your back on your son?

15:20.405 --> 15:23.038
<i>Please, hijo.</i>

15:23.105 --> 15:26.138
<i>Oh, now... now you want
to call me hijo.</i>

15:26.205 --> 15:28.272
Clavo.

15:28.339 --> 15:30.539
You know what,

15:30.606 --> 15:32.372
my friend,
you are a serious playa.

15:33.639 --> 15:35.505
You could learn something
from this man, Pop.

15:35.572 --> 15:37.372
He never gives up.

15:37.439 --> 15:38.938
And I love that
about you, Caine.

15:39.005 --> 15:40.205
Clavo, put it down.

15:40.272 --> 15:42.138
You know what?
That's a good idea.

15:42.205 --> 15:44.505
Violence is bad.
Clavo,

15:44.572 --> 15:47.005
especially for you.
You know what, Caine?

15:47.072 --> 15:49.505
I do not think that you're
in a position to negotiate.

15:49.572 --> 15:51.339
You shoot me, I shoot him.

15:51.405 --> 15:54.239
And I know you- you'd lose
some major sleep over that one.

15:54.305 --> 15:55.972
Clavo...

15:56.038 --> 15:57.205
Don't even think it.

15:57.272 --> 15:58.539
Put it down.

15:58.606 --> 16:00.706
How bad you want me
dead right now, Caine?

16:00.771 --> 16:02.606
That's up to you, my friend.

16:04.105 --> 16:05.539
Been real, Pops.
(gunshot)

16:05.606 --> 16:06.905
Clavo!

16:06.972 --> 16:09.038
(gunfire) TRIPP: Horatio!

16:09.105 --> 16:10.205
Frank!

16:10.272 --> 16:11.505
Yeah, I got him.

16:15.405 --> 16:17.372
(weakly):
Lieutenant.

16:18.606 --> 16:20.239
General, hang on a second.

16:21.539 --> 16:24.305
How did I raise such a man?

16:26.105 --> 16:29.505
General, it's
not your fault.

16:29.572 --> 16:31.871
Promise me, Lieutenant.

16:31.938 --> 16:34.838
Promise me...

16:34.905 --> 16:37.205
you'll end this...

16:37.272 --> 16:38.405
for good.

16:38.472 --> 16:40.905
General, I promise you.

16:42.505 --> 16:44.505
G- General?

16:46.339 --> 16:49.138
(distant sirens)

17:02.405 --> 17:04.738
So he had to come through here.

17:11.239 --> 17:13.405
Every exit had an officer
stationed at it.

17:13.472 --> 17:16.172
How did he get out?

17:16.239 --> 17:18.972
Ma'am...

17:28.005 --> 17:30.105
I think I may know.

17:38.838 --> 17:41.938
Wow. Very Indiana Jones.
Yeah.

17:42.005 --> 17:43.706
Most consulates
have escape exits.

17:43.771 --> 17:45.439
This must be one.

17:47.272 --> 17:48.706
What's that?

17:52.305 --> 17:53.871
What'd you get?

17:53.938 --> 17:55.439
Piece of glass?

18:03.871 --> 18:05.938
That's an uncut diamond.

18:06.005 --> 18:09.172
Okay, so Clavo came here
for a lot more than his father.

18:09.239 --> 18:11.205
How many of these
do you think he has?

18:11.272 --> 18:13.339
Probably more than he could
leave the country with.

18:13.405 --> 18:15.172
He's going to have to try
to sell them somewhere.

18:15.239 --> 18:16.706
Yes, I agree.

18:16.771 --> 18:18.272
And that's exactly how
we're going to find him.

18:18.339 --> 18:21.072
I'm going to take it to Trace.

18:23.205 --> 18:24.822
<i>WOLFE: So this is
where the security guard</i>

18:24.838 --> 18:26.538
<i>said he saw that guy
run past him.</i>

18:29.738 --> 18:31.339
I found a paper clip.

18:31.405 --> 18:33.239
Bag it. You never know.

18:52.005 --> 18:53.405
Ryan!

18:55.838 --> 18:58.038
What?

18:58.105 --> 19:00.105
Jacket and a hat.

19:02.922 --> 19:04.555
Well, it looks like our, uh,

19:04.621 --> 19:06.788
security guard was telling
the truth. Guess the guy

19:06.855 --> 19:08.521
ditched his clothes
in here after he saw

19:08.588 --> 19:10.022
the security guard.

19:10.089 --> 19:12.422
What are the chances they
belong to the guy who shot Eric?

19:12.488 --> 19:14.588
There's only one
way to find out.

19:40.688 --> 19:43.389
(computer beeping)
Got a hit.

19:44.456 --> 19:46.089
(computer beeps)
Tanner Wilcox.

19:46.155 --> 19:48.089
B&E, armed robbery.

19:48.155 --> 19:50.389
And attempted murder.

19:57.189 --> 19:59.356
It's negative.

19:59.422 --> 20:01.755
What'd you do?

20:01.822 --> 20:03.488
What'd you do,
did you washed your hands?

20:03.555 --> 20:04.688
No, I didn't.

20:04.755 --> 20:05.989
I just didn't shoot anyone, man.

20:06.055 --> 20:07.755
No, it's not anyone.

20:07.822 --> 20:09.822
He's a cop.

20:09.888 --> 20:11.356
He's my friend.
He's got a name.

20:11.422 --> 20:13.356
His name is Eric Delko.
Heard about that

20:13.422 --> 20:14.788
on the radio.

20:14.855 --> 20:16.022
That's unfortunate.

20:16.089 --> 20:17.222
Don't do that.

20:17.289 --> 20:19.022
Don't give me attitude.

20:19.089 --> 20:21.289
I know you were there.

20:21.356 --> 20:22.621
I know you pulled the trigger.

20:22.688 --> 20:25.155
No. No, I didn't.

20:25.222 --> 20:27.022
Really? What's this?

20:27.089 --> 20:28.655
What's this?

20:28.722 --> 20:30.322
These all have
your DNA on it.

20:30.389 --> 20:32.089
They belong to you.
Okay!

20:32.155 --> 20:33.222
I was there.

20:33.289 --> 20:35.422
Start talking.

20:35.488 --> 20:37.289
I was doing a walk-through.

20:37.356 --> 20:38.788
Checking for unlocked cars.

20:38.855 --> 20:39.989
Found one.

20:40.055 --> 20:41.456
Sweet laptop inside.

20:41.521 --> 20:43.621
Grabbed it. That's
when I heard sirens.

20:43.688 --> 20:46.055
Thought maybe they were
for me. I took off.

20:46.122 --> 20:48.389
What about the shooting?
Yeah.

20:48.456 --> 20:50.322
Scared the hell out of me.

20:50.389 --> 20:51.788
I was halfway down the stairs.

20:51.855 --> 20:53.788
Then I saw that security guard

20:53.855 --> 20:55.255
Figured I better
toss my clothes.

20:57.456 --> 20:59.155
(distant sirens)

21:02.588 --> 21:04.888
So you can charge me for theft,

21:04.955 --> 21:06.189
but I ain't taking heat

21:06.255 --> 21:07.955
on this other thing.
(cell phone rings)

21:09.122 --> 21:11.122
We'll see about that, won't we?

21:14.089 --> 21:16.222
Hey, Calleigh,
where are you at with this

21:16.289 --> 21:18.521
because this guy doesn't have
any GSR on his hands,

21:18.588 --> 21:20.189
unless you've got
a bullet or a gun.

21:20.255 --> 21:21.822
Well, then we're halfway there.
I'm at the hospital.

21:21.888 --> 21:23.822
They just recovered the bullet
from Delko's head.

21:23.888 --> 21:26.022
That's great. How is, uh...

21:28.322 --> 21:29.555
How's he doing?

21:29.621 --> 21:31.521
I'm about to find out.

21:31.588 --> 21:34.422
Okay, I'll talk to you later.

21:54.322 --> 21:56.655
(softly):
Eric.

22:03.122 --> 22:06.055
Hey. It's Calleigh.

22:10.621 --> 22:11.822
(quietly):
Cal.

22:14.955 --> 22:16.888
You look good.

22:22.955 --> 22:24.322
Your, uh...

22:24.389 --> 22:25.788
your parents are on the way.

22:25.855 --> 22:27.888
They're going to be here
really soon, and, um...

22:27.955 --> 22:32.456
Horatio was here and Alexx.

22:34.989 --> 22:37.888
Where's my sister?

22:37.955 --> 22:40.122
What?

22:40.189 --> 22:42.189
Marisol.

22:44.989 --> 22:46.955
Where's my sister?

22:47.989 --> 22:51.155
I want to see my sister.

22:55.289 --> 22:57.289
Hey...

22:58.488 --> 23:00.255
Why don't you rest.

23:04.555 --> 23:06.555
Just rest.

23:28.356 --> 23:31.155
DUQUESNE:
Alexx.

23:33.989 --> 23:35.356
You okay?

23:37.189 --> 23:40.189
It's what they could get
of the bullet.

23:40.255 --> 23:42.655
I have to warn you,
it's not much.

23:42.722 --> 23:46.222
The rest is lodged
in his temporal lobe.

23:47.255 --> 23:49.555
He's different.

23:49.621 --> 23:52.356
I tried to catch you
before you went in.

23:52.422 --> 23:54.855
Patients with a hematoma
like Eric's, loss of oxygen,

23:54.922 --> 23:57.788
deficits are natural.

23:57.855 --> 23:59.322
Like what?

23:59.389 --> 24:01.289
Compromised motor skills,

24:01.356 --> 24:03.055
slow speech...

24:05.289 --> 24:07.855
He thinks Marisol
is still alive.

24:07.922 --> 24:10.588
Memory loss.

24:11.888 --> 24:14.089
So what's going to happen?

24:14.155 --> 24:16.555
It already has, honey.

24:16.621 --> 24:19.888
He just might not be
the Eric we know him to be.

24:35.955 --> 24:37.989
WOMAN: Lieutenant, this is
Judith Freeman with your bank.

24:38.055 --> 24:39.655
You asked me to try to trace

24:39.722 --> 24:42.588
who wired that money into
your account for Clavo Cruz?

24:42.655 --> 24:43.588
Yes. Any progress?

24:43.655 --> 24:44.888
Ran a reverse trace

24:44.955 --> 24:46.922
on the transfer;
found a bank in the Caymans.

24:46.989 --> 24:48.955
Yes, unmarked accounts,
no doubt.

24:49.022 --> 24:50.955
But our bank investigators
turned up

24:51.022 --> 24:52.922
a social,
which took us to a name.

24:52.989 --> 24:54.888
A Joseph Trevi.

24:54.955 --> 24:57.055
Joseph Trevi?

24:57.122 --> 24:59.189
I hope this helps.

24:59.255 --> 25:02.322
It does help, Ms. Freeman.
Thank you.

25:07.389 --> 25:09.456
I hear you found my money.

25:09.521 --> 25:11.022
Mr. Trevi...

25:11.089 --> 25:14.089
you transferred that money
into my account so Clavo

25:14.155 --> 25:16.422
could get his hands on it.

25:16.488 --> 25:18.755
I didn't wire that money.
Your name,

25:18.822 --> 25:20.722
Mr. Trevi, is on that account.

25:20.788 --> 25:23.488
Oh, believe me, I'm getting
into it with my accountants.

25:23.555 --> 25:25.055
Heads will roll.

25:25.122 --> 25:27.788
I mean, a million dollars
doesn't make or break me,

25:27.855 --> 25:29.788
but it's the principle
of the thing.

25:29.855 --> 25:30.888
You understand.

25:30.955 --> 25:32.389
Here's what I understand.

25:32.456 --> 25:33.922
You bankrolled Clavo,

25:33.989 --> 25:35.555
there are three
dead police officers,

25:35.621 --> 25:36.888
and I have...

25:36.955 --> 25:39.155
a CSI at death's door.

25:39.222 --> 25:42.322
And I'll make sure
that I donate more

25:42.389 --> 25:43.788
to the Policeman's
Fund next year.

25:43.855 --> 25:47.456
Mr. Trevi, I would be
careful if I were you.

25:47.521 --> 25:50.289
You are the one who
should be careful.

25:50.356 --> 25:51.989
The way I heard it,

25:52.055 --> 25:54.655
<i>you gave Mr. Cruz the million,
Lieutenant.</i>

25:54.722 --> 25:57.422
If I were a betting man,
Mr. Trevi,

25:57.488 --> 26:00.922
I would say that you've been
in contact with Clavo,

26:00.989 --> 26:03.955
and the payoff is diamonds.

26:04.022 --> 26:06.122
I'll tell you what.

26:06.189 --> 26:08.588
I'll let my lawyer
take that bet.

26:07.989 --> 26:12.489
Yeah, and you both gonna lose.

26:20.722 --> 26:24.222
located four blocks
from Baracan Consulate.

26:28.139 --> 26:29.855
MDPD! Get out of the car!

26:29.922 --> 26:32.022
Car is clear.

26:43.755 --> 26:46.822
(phone ringing)

26:46.888 --> 26:49.089
Calleigh, Frank.
I just found

26:49.155 --> 26:50.922
what's supposed to be
Clavo's getaway car

26:50.988 --> 26:53.422
a couple of, uh, blocks
from the consulate.

26:53.489 --> 26:54.522
What about Clavo?

26:54.588 --> 26:55.855
No. I think he had

26:55.922 --> 26:58.322
to improvise
when he went out the back way.

26:58.389 --> 27:02.089
Good news is, I've got 50, maybe
more of the gunmelt guns inside.

27:02.155 --> 27:04.855
Great. Bring 'em in-
let's get started.

27:04.922 --> 27:07.055
Hopefully, I'll have something
to compare them to.

27:07.122 --> 27:08.922
All right.

27:18.155 --> 27:20.021
Hey.
Hey.

27:20.088 --> 27:22.388
Heard you recovered
some diamonds at the consulate.

27:22.455 --> 27:24.355
<i>Yeah, well, not some
diamonds, just one.</i>

27:24.422 --> 27:25.655
Oh.
Singular,

27:25.722 --> 27:27.322
one.

27:27.388 --> 27:30.021
That is a weird-looking rock.

27:30.088 --> 27:31.622
This is a raw diamond.

27:31.689 --> 27:33.522
It's uncut and unpolished
- they don't just

27:33.589 --> 27:35.789
come out of the ground
looking like engagement stones.

27:35.856 --> 27:39.155
A lot of hands figure
into the process.

27:39.222 --> 27:41.988
How does the diamond and Clavo
fit together? Well, I scraped

27:42.055 --> 27:45.021
the surface of the diamond
and I ran it for trace.

27:46.555 --> 27:48.488
High in sulfite and nickel.

27:48.555 --> 27:49.855
Nat, I'm a DNA girl.

27:49.922 --> 27:51.488
You're going to have
to help me out on this one.

27:51.555 --> 27:53.422
Well, basically it means

27:53.488 --> 27:55.155
it's consistent with
sources in Sierra Leone.

27:55.222 --> 27:56.389
Africa.

27:56.456 --> 27:57.888
You think these
are blood diamonds?

27:57.955 --> 28:00.356
I think this diamond's
come full circle.

28:17.456 --> 28:19.855
While he had
diplomatic immunity,

28:19.922 --> 28:21.855
Clavo smuggled raw
diamonds into Miami

28:21.922 --> 28:23.688
using the Baracan
diplomatic pouch.

28:23.755 --> 28:27.955
And here, Clavo steals guns
to get his diamonds.

28:28.022 --> 28:29.588
Exactly. I think he's been
stockpiling these diamonds

28:29.655 --> 28:31.322
at the consulate
for a while,

28:31.389 --> 28:33.555
and the only thing that stopped
his little business is the fact

28:33.621 --> 28:35.488
that we stuck him in
jail two years ago.

28:35.555 --> 28:37.855
I think he was just waiting for the
right time to sell those diamonds,

28:37.922 --> 28:39.456
and he got arrested
before he got the chance.

28:39.521 --> 28:40.822
Now that
he has them back,

28:40.888 --> 28:42.488
I wonder who he's going
to sell them to.

28:42.555 --> 28:44.989
It would have to be someone who
really knows what they're doing.

28:45.055 --> 28:46.555
TRIPP:
It's not just the terrorists

28:46.621 --> 28:49.055
that Customs and Border
Protection are keeping track of.

28:49.122 --> 28:50.222
That's what
I was hoping.

28:50.289 --> 28:51.788
They flag people
who make repeated trips

28:51.855 --> 28:52.822
to the same country.

28:52.888 --> 28:54.089
Let's try Belgium.

28:54.155 --> 28:55.922
Why Belgium?
90% of the world's

28:55.989 --> 28:58.688
raw diamonds are
distributed from there.

29:10.621 --> 29:12.089
How many trips per year?

29:12.155 --> 29:13.055
Five to ten.

29:17.855 --> 29:19.822
Well, okay, we got

29:19.888 --> 29:21.422
about 15 names here.
Now what?

29:21.488 --> 29:23.722
Well, let's see who's
traveled the most recently.

29:30.356 --> 29:31.855
Audrey Van Der Mere.

29:31.922 --> 29:33.389
Got here about three days ago.

29:33.456 --> 29:34.788
It's convenient timing.

29:34.855 --> 29:37.588
Who's she work for?

29:40.922 --> 29:44.555
Duncroft Diamonds.

29:55.188 --> 29:57.255
Clavo Cruz.

29:57.322 --> 29:59.355
He looks dangerous.

29:59.422 --> 30:01.755
I've never seen him.

30:01.822 --> 30:03.555
We have reason
to believe

30:03.622 --> 30:04.988
that he may be selling
illicit diamonds

30:05.055 --> 30:06.155
on the black market.

30:06.222 --> 30:07.522
Really.

30:07.589 --> 30:10.121
Well, I can assure you,
I'm a reputable dealer.

30:10.188 --> 30:11.222
Understood.

30:11.288 --> 30:12.789
I'm just saying...

30:12.856 --> 30:15.422
maybe he sold them to someone
else who sold them to you.

30:15.489 --> 30:17.956
There's always politics
involved

30:18.021 --> 30:19.655
when it comes to diamonds.

30:19.722 --> 30:21.121
My job is to make sure

30:21.188 --> 30:23.822
they come into hands
of the people who want them.

30:23.889 --> 30:25.188
Do you ever worry

30:25.255 --> 30:26.889
about the hands of the
people who made them?

30:26.956 --> 30:28.088
Everybody works hard.

30:28.155 --> 30:30.422
People don't want
to hear about that.

30:30.489 --> 30:33.555
They just want to know
they're getting quality.

30:33.622 --> 30:36.021
I'm sure.

30:36.088 --> 30:38.355
Do me a favor and look
at one more picture.

30:39.489 --> 30:41.121
This is Joseph Trevi.

30:41.188 --> 30:42.288
Do you know him?

30:42.355 --> 30:44.522
Officer, really.

30:44.589 --> 30:46.088
I'm very busy.

30:46.155 --> 30:48.021
Pretty simple question,
Ms. Van Der Mere.

30:48.088 --> 30:50.789
Well, it's one
I'm not inclined to answer.

30:50.856 --> 30:54.322
Now, if you'll excuse me.

31:04.988 --> 31:07.322
I have something I think
you're going to want to see.

31:07.388 --> 31:09.589
That's Joseph Trevi.

31:09.655 --> 31:12.021
He's deep in this thing.

31:12.088 --> 31:13.255
The diamond lady's
attitude confirmed it,

31:13.322 --> 31:14.689
so I Googled him.

31:14.755 --> 31:16.155
It turns out, he's from
a really wealthy family.

31:16.222 --> 31:18.188
They're like the
Kennedy's over there.

31:18.255 --> 31:20.789
This is a Baracan
newspaper.

31:20.856 --> 31:22.822
Look who he's
standing next to.

31:22.889 --> 31:25.155
I see that. General Cruz.

31:25.222 --> 31:27.088
That's
from 27 years ago.

31:27.155 --> 31:28.522
So I did a little
more digging.

31:28.589 --> 31:30.922
Mm-hmm. Turns out he left the country

31:30.988 --> 31:32.889
just a few months after
this picture was taken.

31:32.956 --> 31:35.822
Right at the time
of Clavo's birth.

31:35.889 --> 31:38.055
So, Clavo's lost one father.

31:38.121 --> 31:40.622
Maybe he found another.

31:40.689 --> 31:42.422
Let's get a warrant
for DNA.

31:43.655 --> 31:44.956
I told you,

31:45.021 --> 31:46.422
I don't know Clavo Cruz.

31:46.489 --> 31:47.755
You're lying.

31:47.822 --> 31:50.689
Such a confident man.

31:50.755 --> 31:52.188
We ranour DNA, Mr. Trevi,

31:52.255 --> 31:53.622
and it turns out
you're his father.

31:53.689 --> 31:56.021
Only by blood.

31:56.088 --> 31:58.088
You have something else
in common with him.

31:58.155 --> 32:00.188
You're an accessory
to murder, now.

32:00.255 --> 32:01.622
TRIPP:
The wire transfer.

32:01.689 --> 32:04.322
No way a judge will believe
that was stolen now.

32:04.388 --> 32:05.755
Not between father and son.

32:09.956 --> 32:12.856
Seven weeks ago
Clavo contacted me.

32:12.922 --> 32:15.121
He said he had a
plan to get out.

32:15.188 --> 32:16.489
Needed a million.

32:16.555 --> 32:18.988
I figured it was
for lawyers fees.

32:19.055 --> 32:21.522
So you were clueless
of the gun heist

32:21.589 --> 32:22.589
and the courthouse
bombing.

32:22.655 --> 32:24.021
Of course. I'm a businessman.

32:23.748 --> 32:25.015
A legitimate one.

32:25.082 --> 32:26.715
Why would I get involved?

32:26.781 --> 32:28.681
Well, I can think of
about 45 million reasons.

32:28.748 --> 32:31.415
As I said before,
we have your bank account.

32:31.482 --> 32:33.648
TRIPP: $45 million was just deposited

32:33.715 --> 32:34.748
in that Cayman account.

32:34.815 --> 32:36.015
That money came

32:36.082 --> 32:38.015
from a pile of blood
diamonds, didn't it?

32:38.082 --> 32:42.115
Clavo presented
me some diamonds,

32:42.182 --> 32:44.982
I had no reason to believe
they weren't clean.

32:45.048 --> 32:47.048
We met a woman,
we sold them.

32:47.115 --> 32:50.516
I put the money into
a Cayman back account.

32:50.582 --> 32:52.516
There's nothing illegal
about that.

32:52.582 --> 32:55.048
You're not planning to share
that money with him, are you?

32:55.115 --> 32:58.249
He's not my son.
I don't even know him.

32:58.315 --> 33:00.815
His mother must have
told him who I am.

33:00.882 --> 33:02.349
Where is he?

33:05.748 --> 33:09.182
I'm supposed to call him, but I
have no intention of doing it.

33:09.249 --> 33:11.082
Change your mind.

33:11.149 --> 33:12.781
Call him.

33:20.415 --> 33:22.449
He just called me.

33:26.715 --> 33:28.948
CLAVO:
What took you so long?

33:29.015 --> 33:32.048
I was visiting someone
in intensive care, Clavo.

33:32.115 --> 33:34.681
Lieutenant Caine.

33:34.748 --> 33:37.449
Now my parade has officially
been rained on.

33:37.516 --> 33:39.516
So, I'm sitting here
with Joseph Trevi,

33:39.582 --> 33:41.048
your biological father.

33:41.115 --> 33:44.015
And how is Dad?

33:44.082 --> 33:45.315
Well, he's given you up,

33:45.382 --> 33:48.115
and he has no plans
to contact you, Clavo.

33:50.149 --> 33:51.915
No, no, he
wouldn't do that.

33:51.982 --> 33:54.315
As a matter of fact
he would, my friend.

33:54.382 --> 33:56.815
Which makes you all alone,
doesn't it?

33:56.882 --> 33:58.648
You know what?
You're wrong, Caine.

33:58.715 --> 34:00.748
You're wrong
'cause I got you.

34:00.815 --> 34:03.382
I got you in my face
every minute of every day,

34:03.449 --> 34:04.715
and this cat
and mouse thing,

34:04.781 --> 34:06.449
it's just about to
start getting fun.

34:06.516 --> 34:08.516
Clavo, I want you
to listen to me.

34:08.581 --> 34:11.715
This is your opportunity
to turn yourself in.

34:11.781 --> 34:14.648
Over my dead body, Caine.

34:14.649 --> 34:17.149
Then over your dead body it is going to be...

34:35.998 --> 34:38.797
Well, at least we got most of
the gunmelt guns back.

34:38.864 --> 34:42.165
These were the ones
taken from Clavo's car.

34:43.531 --> 34:44.899
How's it coming with the bullet?

34:44.965 --> 34:48.299
I've only got about
15% of the projectile,

34:48.366 --> 34:50.099
but I think there's
enough stria to gea hit.

34:50.165 --> 34:53.366
It's a.223 caliber bullet,
which helps narrow the search.

34:53.431 --> 34:54.864
You'll get it.

34:54.931 --> 34:56.398
(beeps)

34:57.598 --> 34:58.965
I don't believe it.
I got it.

34:59.032 --> 35:00.765
All right.

35:00.832 --> 35:02.431
Let's do the gun.

35:05.798 --> 35:07.266
This is interesting.

35:08.266 --> 35:10.565
Ruger 1022 rifle with a scope.

35:10.632 --> 35:11.565
It's a gunmelt gun.

35:11.632 --> 35:12.865
Rifle?

35:12.932 --> 35:14.431
I thought we were
looking for a handgun.

35:14.498 --> 35:17.398
A.223 can fit either
a handgun or a rifle.

35:17.465 --> 35:19.498
We were looking for
the wrong gun.

35:19.565 --> 35:20.765
Yeah.

35:20.832 --> 35:23.398
It's right here.

35:23.465 --> 35:24.665
Wait a minute.

35:26.232 --> 35:28.266
If Delko was shot
with a rifle...

35:28.332 --> 35:30.398
GSR test.

35:30.465 --> 35:32.565
We swabbed the wrong hand.

35:58.065 --> 35:59.431
You shot my friend.

35:59.498 --> 36:00.865
I don't know what
you're talking about.

36:00.932 --> 36:02.132
Ryan! Hey, man, you want
to play a game with me?

36:02.199 --> 36:03.498
Easy!

36:03.565 --> 36:05.698
Look, whatever happened, okay,

36:05.765 --> 36:07.531
I didn't have anything to
do with it. You can deny it

36:07.598 --> 36:09.001
all you want, but
the proof is right there.

36:09.016 --> 36:10.982
You took a shooter's stance and
that's why the gunshot residue

36:10.999 --> 36:13.531
ended up on your left hand
instead your right.

36:19.948 --> 36:22.415
When you fire a bullet,

36:22.482 --> 36:25.115
the gunpowder
doesn't always burn.

36:25.182 --> 36:26.582
The bullet comes out,
so does gunpowder,

36:26.649 --> 36:27.781
ends up on you.

36:30.616 --> 36:32.815
(sighs)

36:32.881 --> 36:35.249
Clavo said he was going to
give me a hundred grand.

36:35.315 --> 36:37.716
I'd finally get
to pay my car off.

36:38.915 --> 36:41.515
You put a bullet
in my partner's brain.

36:41.582 --> 36:44.982
I don't give a damn
about your car.

36:47.015 --> 36:49.482
Get him out of here.

37:02.415 --> 37:05.048
BOA VISTA:
Hey, Ryan.

37:05.115 --> 37:08.282
Is this my file on
Audrey Van Der Mere?

37:09.682 --> 37:11.682
Yeah.

37:11.781 --> 37:13.582
I figured that if Clavo's
out there with nothing,

37:13.649 --> 37:14.748
maybe he'd try
to get something back.

37:14.815 --> 37:17.315
The diamonds.

37:17.382 --> 37:19.048
But I searched
Duncroft's showroom.

37:19.115 --> 37:20.315
There's no uncut diamonds.

37:20.382 --> 37:22.881
<i>Right, there's
no uncut diamonds.</i>

37:22.948 --> 37:23.948
She's just a
wholesaler.

37:24.015 --> 37:25.482
She doesn't process diamonds.

37:25.549 --> 37:27.382
Well, she didn't,
but take a look at this.

37:27.449 --> 37:28.582
This is a work visa

37:28.649 --> 37:31.249
that was obtained
by Audrey Van Der Mere.

37:31.865 --> 37:33.865
Negandra Padir?
What's his story?

37:33.932 --> 37:35.498
He entered the country
three days ago.

37:35.565 --> 37:37.865
And he was traveling
with five children.

37:41.266 --> 37:44.799
Natalia...
he's a diamond cutter.

37:44.865 --> 37:46.498
She is laundering the
diamonds; she's just getting

37:46.565 --> 37:48.232
somebody else to do her
dirty work. Take a look

37:48.298 --> 37:50.166
at what he listed
as his residence.

37:50.232 --> 37:52.331
BOA VISTA:
1145 Ocean, Bal Harbor.

37:52.398 --> 37:53.598
That's Duncroft.

37:53.665 --> 37:56.232
If the diamonds are there,
maybe Clavo will be.

38:03.932 --> 38:05.182
Miami-Dade P.D.

38:05.199 --> 38:06.965
We have
a search warrant.

38:08.032 --> 38:09.399
You've already searched
the store.

38:09.415 --> 38:10.382
That was for
the showroom.

38:10.449 --> 38:12.482
This is
for the whole premises.

38:13.915 --> 38:15.815
This Clavo you're looking for
isn't here.

38:15.882 --> 38:18.182
Yeah, well, we're
going to see about that.

38:29.115 --> 38:30.882
Hey, what's
behind this door?

38:30.948 --> 38:32.215
It's storage.

38:32.282 --> 38:33.748
Nothing
that concerns you.

38:33.815 --> 38:36.449
Either you open this
door or we will.

38:49.149 --> 38:50.215
You see?

38:50.282 --> 38:52.565
It's just supplies in there.

38:52.582 --> 38:54.515
What king of storage closet
has stairs and another door?

38:54.582 --> 38:56.615
Where does that door lead?

38:57.682 --> 39:01.582
No use stalling,
Ms. Van Der Mere.

39:01.649 --> 39:03.982
Just keep
those policemen out.

39:04.049 --> 39:06.215
They'll scare my staff.

39:27.415 --> 39:30.049
MAN:
Work, work.

39:45.216 --> 39:47.782
Well, this is something
you don't see every day,

39:47.849 --> 39:49.049
Nalia.

39:49.116 --> 39:51.149
Children working
in a sweatshop in Bal Harbor.

39:51.216 --> 39:52.949
How old are these children?
I give them a good life,

39:53.015 --> 39:55.015
I can assure you.

39:55.849 --> 39:57.348
Better than they had.

39:57.415 --> 39:59.149
They have meals,
a place to sleep,

39:59.216 --> 40:01.482
money for their families.
They are children.

40:01.548 --> 40:03.015
You're using kids

40:03.082 --> 40:04.482
to cleanse conflict diamonds?
Some of the world's

40:04.548 --> 40:06.149
most beautiful diamonds come

40:06.216 --> 40:07.749
from some very
ugly places.

40:07.815 --> 40:10.149
I am merely answering
a retail demand.

40:10.216 --> 40:12.515
Nobody wants diamonds
made like this.

40:12.582 --> 40:13.782
We're taking everything.

40:13.849 --> 40:14.949
Everything in my store

40:15.015 --> 40:16.049
is not made
from conflict diamonds.

40:16.116 --> 40:17.548
Unfortunately for you,

40:17.615 --> 40:19.015
once they're polished,
you can't tell the difference,

40:19.082 --> 40:20.515
so we're going
to seize it all,

40:20.582 --> 40:21.782
including the children.

40:30.281 --> 40:32.815
WOLFE: Let's get these kids out of here.

41:00.999 --> 41:05.466
I decided to take you
up on your offer

41:05.531 --> 41:06.765
and turn myself in.

41:08.299 --> 41:09.932
So to speak.

41:12.698 --> 41:14.865
You're here

41:14.932 --> 41:16.665
because you want me to kill you.

41:16.732 --> 41:19.932
Yet another startling
revelation on the obvious.

41:22.565 --> 41:24.865
I will...

41:24.932 --> 41:27.798
kill you, Clavo.

41:27.865 --> 41:29.631
This ends right now.

41:29.698 --> 41:32.099
I know.

41:35.665 --> 41:37.832
I know.

41:38.865 --> 41:40.299
So you take care.

41:40.865 --> 41:42.099
(grunts)

42:07.165 --> 42:09.265
Take care, Clavo.

42:11.631 --> 42:14.099
(sirens wailing)

42:28.132 --> 42:31.132
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

42:34.798 --> 42:37.099
We got him, Eric.

42:39.099 --> 42:41.531
(whispers):
H?

42:41.598 --> 42:43.698
Yeah.

42:44.698 --> 42:47.132
I don't remember anything.

42:49.132 --> 42:52.099
You were shot
in the line of duty, Eric.

42:52.165 --> 42:54.299
You're in the hospital.

43:07.299 --> 43:10.498
Where's Marisol?

43:10.565 --> 43:13.232
Where's my sister?

43:15.232 --> 43:18.565
Why isn't she here?

43:21.565 --> 43:23.498
She's, um...

43:23.565 --> 43:26.265
she's gone, Eric.

43:26.332 --> 43:28.165
It'll come
back to you.
