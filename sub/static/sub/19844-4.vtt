WEBVTT

00:00.001 --> 00:02.657
- Previously, on The Originals...
- You're a wolf. Why aren't you healing?

00:02.659 --> 00:04.882
A monster is still a
biological organism.

00:04.885 --> 00:06.634
- So, I devised a treatment.
- If you found

00:06.637 --> 00:07.903
a way to weaken yourself,

00:07.906 --> 00:09.206
maybe you can

00:09.208 --> 00:10.828
help me find a way
to kill Marcel Gerard.

00:10.831 --> 00:12.531
Maxine. It's Adam.

00:12.534 --> 00:14.979
He never came home.

00:14.981 --> 00:16.501
Adam Folsom was your only case.

00:16.504 --> 00:18.349
We got three additional
reports of missing kids.

00:18.351 --> 00:19.684
Eight years ago, you were running

00:19.686 --> 00:21.052
this city with an iron fist.

00:21.054 --> 00:22.653
I start looking for forms of magic

00:22.655 --> 00:24.221
that you can't defend against.

00:24.223 --> 00:25.423
Sacrificial magic.

00:25.425 --> 00:26.824
You freed it, Vincent.

00:26.826 --> 00:28.793
And now, it must be fed.

00:28.795 --> 00:30.261
I'm so cold.

00:30.263 --> 00:33.264
That witch, he used their personal items

00:33.266 --> 00:34.465
to bind them to the spell.

00:34.467 --> 00:36.467
Hope Mikaelson is linked to that spell.

00:36.469 --> 00:38.502
She's gonna die. We got
to cast a cleansing spell

00:38.504 --> 00:40.071
on New Orleans soil.

00:40.073 --> 00:41.706
Paramedics took the kids

00:41.708 --> 00:43.391
to the hospital to
get checked out.

00:43.394 --> 00:44.942
NOLA PD will notify the parents.

00:46.000 --> 00:52.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

00:55.922 --> 00:57.621
Hell of a sight.

00:57.623 --> 01:00.491
Powerful man overlooking his city.

01:02.428 --> 01:05.930
I wonder if I could convince
you to change your view?

01:05.932 --> 01:09.500
Oh, not that you aren't
stunning, 'cause you are,

01:09.502 --> 01:11.836
I'm just, um...

01:11.838 --> 01:14.205
I'm having trouble shaking
off the day that I had.

01:14.207 --> 01:16.374
So...

01:16.376 --> 01:19.844
you're saying you
could use a distraction?

01:19.846 --> 01:22.046
Allow me to distract.

01:25.351 --> 01:27.418
Mm.

01:30.911 --> 01:32.911
Just ignore it.

01:32.914 --> 01:35.993
No, just one second.

01:37.196 --> 01:39.363
Yeah. All right.

01:41.167 --> 01:42.933
Come in...

01:48.374 --> 01:50.341
Marcel, we got a problem.

01:51.054 --> 01:53.321
Those kids. They never made it home.

01:53.324 --> 01:55.179
What are you talking
about? I loaded those kids

01:55.181 --> 01:56.480
into the ambulance myself.

01:56.482 --> 01:59.216
The ambulance is missing too.

02:23.242 --> 02:25.142
The children are sedated.

02:25.144 --> 02:27.299
I've already prepared them.

02:27.302 --> 02:28.369
For the rich'll.

02:31.184 --> 02:33.150
A token of our master's power.

02:33.152 --> 02:36.053
You'll need it for what's to come.

02:37.790 --> 02:40.324
Just one last thing.

02:40.326 --> 02:41.792
Your friend.

02:41.794 --> 02:43.327
Vincent Griffith.

02:43.329 --> 02:45.896
I won't let anything stop us.

02:47.166 --> 02:48.699
Our home.

02:48.701 --> 02:51.135
Once the pride of our
family, now a flophouse.

02:51.137 --> 02:52.770
Indeed, the mighty have fallen.

02:52.772 --> 02:53.771
Where's Vincent?

02:53.773 --> 02:55.906
Right here.

02:55.908 --> 02:57.254
Kept my word.

02:57.257 --> 02:59.157
Now the only question is whether or not

02:59.160 --> 03:01.079
you guys are gonna keep
yours. As soon as I'm finished

03:01.081 --> 03:03.295
healing your kid, you
got to leave the city.

03:03.298 --> 03:04.882
Well, we're not gonna stay, are we?

03:04.884 --> 03:06.784
Your city has lost its charm.

03:06.786 --> 03:10.154
What he means to say is that
we're very grateful, just...

03:10.156 --> 03:11.489
help her and we'll leave.

03:11.491 --> 03:13.424
Just give us what we need,

03:13.426 --> 03:15.259
and we will do so, happily.

03:15.261 --> 03:16.927
Excuse me.

03:18.598 --> 03:20.865
Okay...

03:23.803 --> 03:26.270
Nettoyer timoun sa a.

03:27.673 --> 03:30.341
Nettoyer timoun.

03:31.844 --> 03:34.612
Nettoyer timoun sa a.

03:34.614 --> 03:37.681
Nettoyer...

03:44.624 --> 03:46.457
Oh...

03:46.459 --> 03:47.725
Mom?

03:47.727 --> 03:49.994
- That's it.
- Oh!

03:49.996 --> 03:52.863
- Your little girl's purified.
- Thank you.

03:52.865 --> 03:55.099
Now look, the only gratitude
I need from any of you

03:55.101 --> 03:56.834
is seeing you leave the city.

03:59.690 --> 04:03.274
Go see your daddy.

04:14.336 --> 04:15.686
What is this?

04:15.688 --> 04:16.720
I don't know.

04:18.858 --> 04:20.991
Mom?

04:20.993 --> 04:23.694
Can you hear that?

04:23.696 --> 04:25.062
It's...

04:25.064 --> 04:26.630
whispers.

04:26.632 --> 04:28.299
Saying a name.

04:28.301 --> 04:30.668
Over and over.

04:30.670 --> 04:33.304
Kre Nah Han...

04:33.306 --> 04:35.706
Kre Nah Han...

04:35.708 --> 04:37.408
Vincent, what...

04:37.410 --> 04:38.776
what is that?

04:38.778 --> 04:42.646
It's a nearly forgotten dialect.

04:42.648 --> 04:44.248
It's Creole.

04:44.250 --> 04:46.984
It means the Hollow.

04:46.986 --> 04:49.253
The Hollow is coming.

04:59.140 --> 05:03.887
- <font color="#D81D1D">Synced and Corrected by VitoSilans</font> -
-- <font color="#138CE9">www.Addic7ed.com</font> --

05:08.406 --> 05:09.739
How is she?

05:09.742 --> 05:11.041
Uh, the fever's back.

05:11.043 --> 05:12.309
But she's not in any pain.

05:12.311 --> 05:15.346
- She's asking for you.
- Well, make an excuse.

05:15.348 --> 05:17.922
I'd rather my daughter not know
I've gone off to murder witches.

05:17.925 --> 05:20.951
- We can not be reckless, Niklaus.
- And how would you have me respond?

05:20.953 --> 05:23.109
Should I delegate my child's
safety to someone else?

05:23.112 --> 05:24.755
Let me see what I can do.

05:24.757 --> 05:26.857
And I will handle
Marcel. Out of the three of us,

05:26.859 --> 05:29.593
I win Most Likely Not
to Get Killed on Arrival.

05:29.595 --> 05:31.462
Whatever we're up against,

05:31.465 --> 05:33.380
it's as much his problem as is it ours.

05:33.383 --> 05:34.965
Leaving me to do what, exactly?

05:34.967 --> 05:37.935
Stay here and protect our daughter.

05:37.937 --> 05:39.103
Do not let anything

05:39.105 --> 05:40.571
or anyone near her.

05:42.908 --> 05:44.074
A word of warning.

05:44.076 --> 05:46.143
The Marcel that you knew is gone.

05:46.145 --> 05:48.512
So, whatever he is now,

05:48.514 --> 05:50.047
he's no ally.

06:02.061 --> 06:04.995
Mm. Oh, I guess I feel asleep working.

06:04.997 --> 06:06.697
Did you get any?

06:06.699 --> 06:09.400
I just woke up from a five-year nap.

06:09.402 --> 06:12.336
You going somewhere?

06:12.338 --> 06:14.705
New Orleans. Hope is still sick.

06:14.707 --> 06:16.807
Klaus asked me to see what I can do.

06:16.809 --> 06:20.177
Great, um... So long as you're
stepping into a war zone,

06:20.179 --> 06:23.080
see if you can't get your
hands on Marcel's venom.

06:23.082 --> 06:26.250
Klaus did say that
Marcel would be occupied.

06:26.252 --> 06:28.686
We can enter his home,

06:28.688 --> 06:30.521
steal whatever we need,

06:30.523 --> 06:32.502
- and leave before anyone notices.
- Okay.

06:32.505 --> 06:34.984
You want me to help you
rob the most deadly vampire

06:34.987 --> 06:36.126
on the planet?

06:36.128 --> 06:38.362
I will pass.

06:38.364 --> 06:40.230
If you're worried about a fight...

06:41.033 --> 06:43.500
allow me to even the odds.

06:47.707 --> 06:49.339
The stone is kyanite.

06:49.341 --> 06:51.408
It's been spelled to
grant you total control

06:51.410 --> 06:52.676
of your werewolf nature,

06:52.678 --> 06:54.244
even during a full moon.

06:56.982 --> 06:58.716
This is a cure.

06:58.718 --> 07:01.351
It's everything I've ever wanted.

07:02.855 --> 07:05.556
What's the catch?

07:05.558 --> 07:08.025
Not a catch.

07:08.027 --> 07:09.727
Insurance.

07:11.831 --> 07:13.197
Yeah.

07:13.199 --> 07:15.866
More like a leash,

07:15.868 --> 07:17.534
spelled so that I can't take it off.

07:17.536 --> 07:18.902
Like you said.

07:18.904 --> 07:20.671
It's everything you ever wanted.

07:21.807 --> 07:23.607
Provided you help me.

07:33.719 --> 07:35.252
How are you feeling?

07:35.254 --> 07:37.387
I'm still so cold.

07:38.891 --> 07:41.325
Are the birds gone?

07:41.327 --> 07:44.094
Yeah. They're gone, sweetheart.

07:44.096 --> 07:46.597
And when you're better,

07:46.599 --> 07:48.966
which will be soon,

07:48.968 --> 07:51.535
you and I are going to
share the biggest plate

07:51.537 --> 07:53.537
of beignets you've ever seen.

07:53.539 --> 07:56.373
And you can tell me where
in this big, wide world

07:56.375 --> 07:59.076
you'd like me to take you next.

07:59.078 --> 08:02.546
Mom said you loved New
Orleans most of all.

08:04.784 --> 08:06.984
I did, once.

08:08.254 --> 08:11.388
But putting your love
in a place is a mistake.

08:12.424 --> 08:15.192
Being here in our home,

08:15.194 --> 08:18.295
seeing these walls,

08:18.297 --> 08:21.064
I am reminded that it is people

08:21.066 --> 08:23.967
who are best suited to fill our hearts.

08:26.205 --> 08:27.304
Dad.

08:27.306 --> 08:30.340
I don't feel so good.

08:35.614 --> 08:38.982
Look, guys. I know
what we're up against.

08:38.984 --> 08:41.597
There's a faction of
our own people, witches.

08:41.601 --> 08:43.544
They've started to make
human sacrifices to a spirit

08:43.547 --> 08:45.022
called the Hollow.

08:45.024 --> 08:47.825
Now, this thing is dark,

08:47.827 --> 08:49.526
it's angry,

08:49.528 --> 08:50.761
it's very powerful.

08:50.763 --> 08:52.930
It is a force my family and I

08:52.932 --> 08:54.498
are here to erase.

08:56.735 --> 08:58.402
- Does not!
- Now,

08:58.404 --> 09:01.839
kindly excuse us, please.

09:01.841 --> 09:05.142
Mr. Griffith and I have much to discuss.

09:06.412 --> 09:07.644
Okay, uh...

09:07.646 --> 09:09.379
Give me a minute.

09:14.240 --> 09:16.741
So, now that we've dispensed
with the needless hysteria...

09:16.744 --> 09:18.288
I got a lot on my plate, Elijah,

09:18.290 --> 09:20.190
without whatever trouble
you're trying to bring my way.

09:20.192 --> 09:21.345
You need me.

09:21.348 --> 09:23.460
And fortunately, I have a long history

09:23.462 --> 09:25.863
of removing anything
undesirable from New Orleans.

09:25.865 --> 09:27.859
I'm probably one of the
things that's on your list.

09:27.861 --> 09:29.632
So I reckon it's best for me work alone.

09:29.635 --> 09:31.034
Oh, it's not an offer.

09:31.036 --> 09:32.603
Children's lives are at risk.

09:32.605 --> 09:34.571
You care about children's lives at risk?

09:34.573 --> 09:37.074
What about Davina Claire, Elijah?

09:37.076 --> 09:39.243
So, you can only see me as some kind

09:39.245 --> 09:41.278
- of merciless butcher.
- Yes.

09:41.280 --> 09:42.537
- I do.
- I'll be whatever you

09:42.540 --> 09:44.181
want me to be, Vincent Griffith.

09:44.183 --> 09:47.251
I'll be the very devil
himself, but make no mistake,

09:47.253 --> 09:49.720
I would violate everything
sacred under the sun

09:49.722 --> 09:51.755
in the name of rescuing my niece.

09:51.757 --> 09:53.824
And right now, according to you...

09:53.826 --> 09:55.792
you are facing two evils.

09:55.794 --> 09:59.496
Wouldn't it be nice to have
one of those by your side?

10:00.599 --> 10:03.533
We're gonna do this my way.

10:03.535 --> 10:05.168
Beautiful.

10:05.170 --> 10:07.104
Your way it is.

10:17.507 --> 10:19.809
Listen up.

10:19.919 --> 10:21.549
Listen up.

10:21.551 --> 10:24.886
For five years now, we've had a truce.

10:24.888 --> 10:26.888
Stayed out of each other's business.

10:26.890 --> 10:28.957
Tended to our own.

10:28.959 --> 10:34.128
But now, your problems
are becoming mine.

10:34.130 --> 10:37.298
Someone is taking children.

10:37.300 --> 10:39.334
As you know, I have one

10:39.336 --> 10:41.402
nonnegotiable rule:

10:41.404 --> 10:44.405
we do not mess with kids.

10:44.407 --> 10:46.140
Now, you've seen that graffiti.

10:49.617 --> 10:52.313
Someone here's got to
know who's responsible.

10:52.315 --> 10:53.882
Right?

10:53.884 --> 10:56.385
So just give me a name. Hmm?

10:56.388 --> 10:57.952
We don't owe you anything.

11:00.323 --> 11:02.290
You're no friend to witches.

11:02.292 --> 11:04.726
You don't trust him.

11:06.930 --> 11:09.597
I get it.

11:09.599 --> 11:12.066
But one of those kids is my daughter.

11:12.068 --> 11:13.468
She's seven.

11:13.470 --> 11:16.070
She likes to paint, catch fireflies,

11:16.072 --> 11:17.505
make up stories.

11:17.507 --> 11:19.173
All I know is that she's sick.

11:19.175 --> 11:21.676
Right now, I don't care about the past.

11:21.678 --> 11:25.680
I'm just a mom

11:25.682 --> 11:27.515
asking you to help me.

11:37.460 --> 11:38.860
There's a girl named Lara.

11:40.330 --> 11:42.230
I saw her draw

11:42.232 --> 11:43.965
the same symbol on her window in blood.

11:43.967 --> 11:46.901
Where do I find this witch?

11:46.903 --> 11:49.370
She's not a witch.

11:50.581 --> 11:52.407
She's one of your kind.

11:52.409 --> 11:53.608
A wolf.

11:53.610 --> 11:58.179
She ran off to the bayou.

12:07.757 --> 12:09.457
Nice job on the lock.

12:09.459 --> 12:11.292
You'd make a good cat burglar.

12:11.294 --> 12:14.429
All magic is just opening
locks and finding loopholes.

12:14.431 --> 12:18.433
So tell me again: why don't
you just tell your family

12:18.435 --> 12:20.501
about our little secret project?

12:20.503 --> 12:23.938
They're overly sensitive
when it comes to Marcel.

12:23.940 --> 12:25.373
Oh, not you, though, huh?

12:25.375 --> 12:27.175
The merciless badass

12:27.177 --> 12:29.110
who doesn't get
sentimental about anyone.

12:29.112 --> 12:31.813
Somebody's got to be the big sister.

12:31.816 --> 12:32.667
Okay.

12:32.670 --> 12:35.350
Since you are so in love with
taking charge, where do we look?

12:35.352 --> 12:37.485
Marcel stockpiled Klaus' blood.

12:37.487 --> 12:39.320
No doubt he did the same with his venom.

12:40.724 --> 12:43.625
He would keep that someplace safe.

12:43.627 --> 12:45.426
You know, that ring

12:45.428 --> 12:47.061
enhances your instincts.

12:47.063 --> 12:48.396
Why not try using them?

12:48.398 --> 12:51.432
Sorry, I don't do bloodhound.

12:51.434 --> 12:53.468
Fine, we'll do it my way.

13:04.648 --> 13:06.147
And who might this be?

13:06.149 --> 13:07.782
These are the ashes

13:07.784 --> 13:10.918
of a witch that lost his way

13:10.920 --> 13:13.287
and it might just be the
key to helping us find ours.

13:13.289 --> 13:15.623
This thing, um,

13:15.625 --> 13:17.091
the Hollow...

13:17.093 --> 13:18.960
its magic has a very unique signature.

13:18.962 --> 13:20.795
I felt it on this witch the other day

13:20.797 --> 13:22.397
when Marcel and I took him out,

13:22.399 --> 13:24.465
so if I can trace that
energy back to its source...

13:24.467 --> 13:26.267
You can find the rest of these fanatics.

13:27.170 --> 13:31.072
So this thing which haunts my niece...

13:31.074 --> 13:33.641
has it spoken to you?

13:35.679 --> 13:38.279
It's more like, um, a broadcast.

13:38.281 --> 13:39.747
And I was able to shut it out,

13:39.749 --> 13:42.150
but a lot of people have
a harder time doing that.

13:42.152 --> 13:44.052
Like your wife.

13:46.489 --> 13:49.090
You know, there's a difference
between what we project

13:49.092 --> 13:51.793
and what we have inside of our hearts,

13:51.795 --> 13:54.796
what we try to hide inside
of our hearts, right?

13:54.798 --> 13:57.065
Now that thing, it took everything

13:57.067 --> 13:59.725
that's dark and twisted inside
of me and it used it against me.

13:59.728 --> 14:01.828
It used it again my wife
and it ended up taking

14:01.831 --> 14:03.404
everything that I've
ever loved away from me.

14:03.406 --> 14:04.429
So, then, you have every reason

14:04.431 --> 14:06.541
- to want to remove it from this earth.
- Yeah.

14:06.543 --> 14:08.009
But let's say that we run into

14:08.011 --> 14:09.310
that thing today, Elijah.

14:09.312 --> 14:11.300
It's gonna take everything

14:11.303 --> 14:12.702
that you want to keep buried,

14:12.705 --> 14:13.800
it's going to use that

14:13.803 --> 14:16.168
and make you do exactly
what it wants you to do.

14:18.000 --> 14:19.567
And that's what makes you a liability

14:19.569 --> 14:22.202
to the very niece that
we're both trying to protect.

14:24.373 --> 14:26.473
Let's get to work.

14:26.475 --> 14:28.776
That man, Vincent...

14:28.778 --> 14:30.611
Mom said he was a witch.

14:30.613 --> 14:32.780
That he came to help me feel better.

14:32.782 --> 14:35.549
But I feel worse.

14:35.551 --> 14:37.818
I know. I know.

14:37.820 --> 14:39.186
But don't worry,

14:39.188 --> 14:40.621
because as we speak,

14:40.623 --> 14:42.957
your mother and your Uncle Elijah

14:42.959 --> 14:45.092
are working with Vincent to fix you up.

14:45.094 --> 14:47.394
So you just stay calm

14:47.396 --> 14:49.229
and they'll make everything all right.

14:51.225 --> 14:53.233
Do you know what it is?

14:53.235 --> 14:54.501
The Hollow?

14:54.503 --> 14:57.972
No, sweetheart...

14:57.974 --> 14:59.506
I don't.

14:59.508 --> 15:02.242
It wants those other
kids. I can feel them.

15:03.679 --> 15:05.479
I think it wants me, too.

15:05.481 --> 15:07.915
I am not gonna let anything take you.

15:07.917 --> 15:10.584
I promise you that.

15:10.586 --> 15:13.253
I'm going to keep you safe,

15:13.255 --> 15:16.624
always and forever.

15:21.731 --> 15:23.263
Chèche in virtute.

15:23.265 --> 15:26.600
Chèche in virtute,
chèche in virtute.

15:29.338 --> 15:31.305
Chèche in virtute.

15:36.278 --> 15:38.045
What is it?

15:38.047 --> 15:40.147
Vincent, what did you see?

15:44.459 --> 15:45.858
How is she?

15:45.861 --> 15:47.521
She's sleeping.

15:47.523 --> 15:49.023
Freya will be here soon

15:49.025 --> 15:51.225
to stir up one of her
medicinal concoctions.

15:51.227 --> 15:52.760
Tell me you have answers.

15:52.762 --> 15:54.495
Marcel and I have a lead.

15:54.497 --> 15:57.297
A wolf who got caught
up with the Hollow.

15:57.299 --> 15:59.592
A wolf involved in witch business?

15:59.595 --> 16:00.768
Crazy, I know.

16:00.770 --> 16:02.870
I want to ask her a few questions.

16:02.872 --> 16:05.439
Well, regardless of her
excuses or your loyalties,

16:05.441 --> 16:08.842
I expect you to show this
traitor the error of her ways.

16:08.844 --> 16:10.644
I'll handle it.

16:11.847 --> 16:14.441
She's not gonna want
to talk to a vampire.

16:14.444 --> 16:15.582
- I'll go.
- The thing is,

16:15.584 --> 16:17.985
the last time I came across
one of the Hollow's goons,

16:17.987 --> 16:20.454
the guy tried to kill
me, so... fair warning.

16:29.799 --> 16:32.633
Lara?

16:32.635 --> 16:34.501
My name's Hayley. I don't know if...

16:34.503 --> 16:36.503
I know who you are.

16:36.505 --> 16:38.372
Hayley Marshall.

16:41.877 --> 16:43.811
I know why you're here.

16:45.948 --> 16:49.650
You're here because of the children.

16:51.387 --> 16:53.520
I'm sorry.

16:53.522 --> 16:55.656
I am.

16:55.658 --> 16:58.392
They're as good as dead.

17:23.598 --> 17:25.732
Weird time to have a drink, bud.

17:27.656 --> 17:29.757
Should be out looking for those kids.

17:29.759 --> 17:31.225
Yeah.

17:34.797 --> 17:36.563
I'm a little upside-down, Will.

17:36.565 --> 17:37.998
I got this, um,

17:38.000 --> 17:41.568
evil mojo just breathing down my back.

17:41.570 --> 17:45.773
And it's the same thing
that took out my wife...

17:45.775 --> 17:48.509
then it took me out...

17:48.511 --> 17:51.044
and now I think it's trying
to take out my best friend.

17:52.181 --> 17:53.914
Was this your plan, Vince?

17:54.950 --> 17:56.416
Invite me here,

17:56.418 --> 17:57.618
confront me?

17:57.620 --> 17:59.586
Whatever this thing promised you,

17:59.588 --> 18:01.855
- it's not gonna deliver.
- You're wrong.

18:01.857 --> 18:04.391
The Hollow rewards those who are loyal.

18:04.393 --> 18:06.586
Maybe if you did what
it asked you to do,

18:06.589 --> 18:07.755
things might be different.

18:07.758 --> 18:09.897
For me. For Cami.

18:09.899 --> 18:11.231
For all of us.

18:11.233 --> 18:12.544
Is that what it told you, Will?

18:12.547 --> 18:15.269
That's what it showed me,
Vince. Look at this city!

18:16.639 --> 18:18.172
It's overrun with evil.

18:18.174 --> 18:19.740
And the only way to take it back

18:19.742 --> 18:22.543
is to do one little evil thing myself.

18:22.545 --> 18:23.610
This is not what you are!

18:23.612 --> 18:24.845
You can walk away from this.

18:24.847 --> 18:26.480
I can help you walk away from this.

18:26.482 --> 18:27.915
You can't help me.

18:29.685 --> 18:31.318
You can't even help yourself.

18:31.320 --> 18:32.953
Don't you see?

18:32.955 --> 18:34.955
You're in the middle of
everything that's to come.

18:34.957 --> 18:37.958
Which is why they sent me here, Vince.

18:37.960 --> 18:40.327
For you.

18:49.338 --> 18:51.711
That's quite the monster
you got lurking in there.

18:55.553 --> 18:57.219
You want to see mine?

19:04.350 --> 19:07.017
I know you can hear me.

19:07.019 --> 19:09.787
I want you to listen.

19:10.856 --> 19:14.057
The heart which beats in your chest

19:14.059 --> 19:17.261
is a warrior's heart.

19:17.263 --> 19:19.463
The heart of a Mikaelson.

19:20.979 --> 19:23.547
Whatever hold this power has over you,

19:23.549 --> 19:27.317
it is nothing compared to your strength.

19:27.319 --> 19:30.987
Yours is a power greater than you know.

19:36.929 --> 19:38.361
Come on.

19:40.632 --> 19:42.065
Hope...

19:58.517 --> 19:59.950
Dad?

20:01.883 --> 20:05.388
I saw them. The other kids.

20:06.740 --> 20:08.906
They're so scared.

20:11.730 --> 20:13.096
Promise me

20:13.098 --> 20:16.266
if you ever see the blue lights,

20:16.268 --> 20:18.635
don't look at them.

20:34.019 --> 20:36.042
I can't open it, which means this is

20:36.045 --> 20:37.589
exactly what we were looking for.

20:37.592 --> 20:40.956
Well, before you blow it
open with a magic bomb,

20:40.959 --> 20:43.277
just keep in mind that they're
gonna know that we were here.

20:43.279 --> 20:44.761
Well, do you have a better idea?

20:44.763 --> 20:46.029
Because my family needs me.

20:46.031 --> 20:48.264
- And I'm out of time for this.
- Go help your niece.

20:48.266 --> 20:50.867
I've got super-duper wolf hearing.

20:50.869 --> 20:53.236
I will crack the safe and if
there's anything that we can use,

20:53.238 --> 20:55.271
- I'll grab it.
- Keelin, if you try to run....

20:55.273 --> 20:58.141
I know. You'll make me turn all hairy.

20:58.143 --> 20:59.909
I got the threat the first time.

21:01.383 --> 21:03.517
You just go. Help your family.

21:03.520 --> 21:05.453
I'll meet you wherever you tell me to.

21:13.211 --> 21:15.545
All right, someone cast
a spell to block his mind

21:15.548 --> 21:16.873
against your vampire tricks, all right?

21:16.875 --> 21:18.307
I can break that, Elijah,

21:18.309 --> 21:19.976
it's just gonna take
me a little bit of time

21:19.978 --> 21:21.699
- That's a luxury we don't have.
- Look, Elijah,

21:21.701 --> 21:23.746
I'm not gonna let you
torture him, all right?

21:23.748 --> 21:25.409
He's my friend and he's
just as much of a victim

21:25.411 --> 21:26.610
as all those kids.

21:29.921 --> 21:32.922
You have five minutes.

21:34.526 --> 21:36.359
We're not here to hurt you.

21:36.361 --> 21:37.627
You can't hurt me any more

21:37.629 --> 21:39.796
than I've already hurt myself.

21:41.533 --> 21:43.633
I didn't know this was gonna happen.

21:45.370 --> 21:46.702
I didn't know they were gonna

21:46.704 --> 21:49.038
- bring children into it.
- It's okay.

21:49.040 --> 21:51.507
Just tell us who "they" are.

21:51.509 --> 21:54.477
Those that serve the Hollow.

21:54.479 --> 21:57.046
Followers of the blue light.

21:57.048 --> 21:59.415
I thought we were doing something good.

21:59.417 --> 22:01.250
Trying to take back our city.

22:01.252 --> 22:02.452
Back from what?

22:02.454 --> 22:05.988
From him.

22:05.990 --> 22:09.358
From the vampires.

22:09.360 --> 22:12.762
For five years we kept quiet.

22:12.764 --> 22:15.998
Watching you lord over
this city like it was yours.

22:16.000 --> 22:18.434
Hey, I spent the last five
years keeping the peace...

22:18.436 --> 22:21.504
It is not your city to rule!

22:21.506 --> 22:24.340
New Orleans belongs to all of us.

22:24.342 --> 22:29.712
And the Hollow offered
us the power we needed.

22:29.714 --> 22:32.515
So long as we pledged our allegiance.

22:32.517 --> 22:34.953
But Lara, you're a Crescent.

22:34.956 --> 22:36.765
You have the pack, you
don't need this cult.

22:36.768 --> 22:38.120
You were gone.

22:38.122 --> 22:40.089
You chose the Original Family

22:40.091 --> 22:41.858
over your own kind.

22:41.860 --> 22:43.759
Don't you see?

22:43.761 --> 22:46.395
Our pack means nothing.

22:46.397 --> 22:48.130
You mean nothing!

22:48.132 --> 22:49.465
You're right.

22:49.467 --> 22:51.901
I wasn't there.

22:51.903 --> 22:53.569
But I have a daughter now.

22:53.571 --> 22:56.272
And, Lara, she's one of the kids.

22:56.274 --> 22:59.141
She's one of the kids that's in danger.

22:59.143 --> 23:01.143
So, please,

23:01.145 --> 23:02.845
help us help them.

23:06.584 --> 23:09.519
You can't help them.

23:09.521 --> 23:12.622
The Hollow wants power.

23:12.624 --> 23:15.625
The kind that only comes from sacrifice.

23:15.627 --> 23:20.830
Those kids will die
so it can get stronger.

23:23.034 --> 23:25.801
And it will feed.

23:25.803 --> 23:27.795
And it will rise.

23:27.798 --> 23:31.474
And we will all bow before it.

23:31.476 --> 23:34.043
The great beast.

23:36.180 --> 23:37.647
Even you.

23:39.350 --> 23:42.552
My only mercy is I
won't be here to see it.

23:50.028 --> 23:52.495
Briser...

23:53.698 --> 23:55.698
Briser le bouchlier.

23:55.700 --> 24:00.136
Briser le bouchlier.
Briser le bouchlier.

24:00.138 --> 24:02.305
- Briser le bouchlier.
- Time's up.

24:02.307 --> 24:04.860
- Hold on, Elijah!
- Why do you insist?

24:04.863 --> 24:07.242
Because he's my friend.
And because a witch

24:07.245 --> 24:08.978
told me that I'm the one
that gave this thing breath.

24:08.980 --> 24:11.113
Now I don't know what I did
to let it into this world,

24:11.115 --> 24:14.417
but I know I ain't just
gonna let it take him out.

24:14.419 --> 24:17.386
Finish it.

24:20.032 --> 24:22.091
Marquer nonm sa a.

24:22.093 --> 24:24.460
Marquer nonm sa a.

24:33.137 --> 24:35.404
There's no going back, Vince.

24:44.015 --> 24:46.983
Any other wonderful ideas?

24:46.985 --> 24:50.453
I tagged him with magic,
so now we can trace him.

24:52.090 --> 24:53.489
Right back to the kids.

24:53.491 --> 24:55.224
Let's go.

24:55.226 --> 24:57.393
Oh...

25:01.772 --> 25:03.460
Yeah...

25:07.286 --> 25:10.387
Assume you told everybody
to be on their best behavior?

25:10.389 --> 25:12.089
Oh, I told them.

25:12.091 --> 25:13.657
Now whether or not they'll be obedient

25:13.659 --> 25:16.994
is another thing altogether.

25:16.996 --> 25:19.263
- Where's Hope?
- Freya's with her now.

25:19.265 --> 25:22.099
She's fighting it. Whatever it is.

25:22.101 --> 25:23.867
The kids are attached to that
spell: if we save the kids,

25:23.869 --> 25:25.135
we save your little girl.

25:25.137 --> 25:27.304
And the sooner you all

25:27.306 --> 25:28.305
can be on your way.

25:28.307 --> 25:30.040
Clearly,

25:30.042 --> 25:32.643
we're skipping all the
hugs and hellos. Vincent?

25:32.645 --> 25:35.340
Trail leads off this way, so, I guess

25:35.343 --> 25:36.743
we, uh, follow the breadcrumbs.

25:36.746 --> 25:39.083
Tactless savages holding
a ghost-raising rave.

25:39.085 --> 25:40.317
Best make short work of them.

25:40.319 --> 25:42.152
- I say we...
- We split up.

25:42.154 --> 25:44.655
Klaus, you're with me, I'm not
letting you out of my sight.

25:44.657 --> 25:46.123
Anybody got a problem with that...

25:46.125 --> 25:49.793
I don't give a damn.

25:53.350 --> 25:55.833
I assume you embark upon this
journey out of the kindness

25:55.835 --> 25:57.894
- of your heart?
- There are kids in trouble.

25:57.897 --> 25:59.030
Yours included.

25:59.033 --> 26:01.105
It's a bit late for you to
suddenly care about my child,

26:01.107 --> 26:02.929
given you left her
fatherless for five years.

26:02.932 --> 26:04.198
Well, speaking from experience,

26:04.201 --> 26:06.368
I figured I was doing her a favor.

26:06.371 --> 26:07.411
Careful.

26:07.413 --> 26:09.543
Lest your insults mar an
already tentative peace.

26:09.546 --> 26:11.582
All right, listen, I don't
care about our peace, all right?

26:11.584 --> 26:13.183
I care about finding these missing kids

26:13.185 --> 26:15.819
and wiping out the messed
up people who took them.

26:15.821 --> 26:18.322
Root out the problems,
make them go away.

26:18.324 --> 26:20.157
That's what you do when you're the king.

26:20.159 --> 26:22.159
All I see is a petulant prince.

26:22.161 --> 26:23.894
Always with the insults.
You never do learn.

26:23.896 --> 26:25.362
On the contrary.

26:25.364 --> 26:27.631
My time in your dungeon
clarified my priorities.

26:27.633 --> 26:28.966
My concerns are with my child.

26:28.968 --> 26:30.096
And as for you,

26:30.099 --> 26:31.832
I can imagine no better revenge

26:31.835 --> 26:33.270
than leaving you to the endless struggle

26:33.272 --> 26:35.005
to prove yourself my better.

26:35.007 --> 26:36.604
You're welcome, by the way.

26:36.607 --> 26:38.242
So you knew this Crescent girl?

26:38.244 --> 26:39.836
I did.

26:39.839 --> 26:42.139
But whatever that was
today, that wasn't her.

26:42.142 --> 26:44.715
She said something about blue light.

26:44.717 --> 26:46.250
Yeah, that's the Fifolet.

26:46.253 --> 26:48.051
New Orleans legend
says that a spirit might

26:48.053 --> 26:50.454
present itself in a
bright blue ball of light.

26:50.456 --> 26:51.722
Wonderful.

26:51.724 --> 26:53.023
How do we kill it?

26:53.025 --> 26:55.159
We'll find out soon enough.

27:39.905 --> 27:41.805
Now that you've returned, brother,

27:41.807 --> 27:45.609
you may join us as we claim our power.

27:45.611 --> 27:48.312
Our rightful place.

27:48.314 --> 27:51.081
And lay waste to all who
would deny our master.

27:56.221 --> 27:58.314
Are you prepared to prove your loyalty

27:58.317 --> 28:00.856
- to the Hollow?
- I know

28:00.859 --> 28:03.026
what I have to do. I'm not afraid.

28:05.531 --> 28:08.165
We should begin.

28:10.703 --> 28:13.370
Enough with this circus of sadists.

28:28.988 --> 28:30.754
Hey, we got to get
the kids. Get the kids!

28:34.793 --> 28:37.127
Okay, here.

28:41.367 --> 28:42.899
Vinculum mond sa.

28:42.901 --> 28:45.124
Vinculum mond sa.

28:45.127 --> 28:46.837
Will? Will!

28:46.839 --> 28:48.305
Come on, man.

28:48.307 --> 28:50.407
- It's over.
- No, Vince.

28:50.409 --> 28:52.109
It's only just begun.

29:04.254 --> 29:06.021
You can't stop what's coming.

29:08.694 --> 29:09.926
No!

29:30.582 --> 29:33.150
Oh, man, we got this all wrong.

29:33.152 --> 29:34.484
They wanted us here.

29:34.486 --> 29:35.819
Why?

29:35.821 --> 29:37.254
They want to channel your power,

29:37.256 --> 29:39.656
and anchor the Hollow
to the living world.

29:51.804 --> 29:53.370
Okay, they're alive.

29:53.372 --> 29:54.938
These kids

29:54.940 --> 29:57.785
are linked to that ritual.

29:57.788 --> 29:59.609
We can't free Marcel and Klaus

29:59.611 --> 30:01.278
unless we break the spell.

30:01.280 --> 30:02.546
How do we stop this?

30:02.548 --> 30:04.106
I don't know!

30:04.109 --> 30:05.849
It's a sacrificial ritual.

30:05.851 --> 30:06.950
I can't break it

30:06.952 --> 30:08.185
unless I kill one of the kids.

30:08.187 --> 30:10.111
No, no.

30:10.114 --> 30:11.722
There has to be another way.

30:22.301 --> 30:24.501
Where are we?

30:30.209 --> 30:33.043
Don't look into the blue light.

30:33.045 --> 30:35.699
Yeah, um...

30:35.702 --> 30:37.879
so these kids are powering that ritual.

30:37.882 --> 30:39.403
But there might be a loophole,

30:39.406 --> 30:41.418
if I link it to you.

30:41.420 --> 30:43.887
Are you suggesting we take my life?

30:43.889 --> 30:44.817
I'm suggesting

30:44.820 --> 30:46.423
we stake you with wood.

30:46.425 --> 30:47.691
You die,

30:47.693 --> 30:48.859
temporarily,

30:48.861 --> 30:50.761
and that might be enough to

30:50.763 --> 30:52.562
break the spell.

30:54.066 --> 30:56.366
What is this?

30:58.256 --> 30:59.689
Shut your eyes.

31:09.014 --> 31:11.415
Mare.

31:11.417 --> 31:13.650
Mare leurs.

31:13.652 --> 31:16.553
Mare leurs esprits.

31:22.528 --> 31:25.295
Mare leurs esprits!

31:25.297 --> 31:27.964
Mare leurs esprits!

31:27.966 --> 31:30.867
Mare leurs esprits!

31:30.869 --> 31:33.703
Mare leurs esprits!

31:41.597 --> 31:43.264
Look away!

31:43.267 --> 31:45.414
Hayley, do it now!

32:10.309 --> 32:12.342
Did it work?

32:26.825 --> 32:28.992
Hope.

32:30.290 --> 32:32.290
We're not cold anymore.

33:09.198 --> 33:11.231
Come back for one last look?

33:12.101 --> 33:14.301
This place...

33:15.204 --> 33:17.104
this city...

33:17.106 --> 33:19.406
a lot of tragedy happened here.

33:19.408 --> 33:21.575
A lot I regret.

33:21.577 --> 33:23.744
But Hope was born here.

33:23.746 --> 33:25.579
So there was good

33:25.581 --> 33:27.581
with all that bad.

33:32.087 --> 33:34.621
After everything that's happened,

33:34.623 --> 33:36.490
the city is yours.

33:39.341 --> 33:41.574
I hope it brings you peace.

33:46.748 --> 33:48.314
Good-bye, Marcel.

33:50.952 --> 33:52.819
Do one thing for me.

33:53.360 --> 33:54.659
Tell your daughter

33:54.662 --> 33:56.589
she doesn't need to fear me.

33:56.591 --> 33:58.758
She never did.

34:16.244 --> 34:18.244
Glad you showed up.

34:18.246 --> 34:20.080
It's not like I had much of a choice.

34:20.081 --> 34:21.715
Keelin...

34:21.717 --> 34:23.817
- You have to understand....
- Look,

34:23.819 --> 34:26.152
maybe you and yours

34:26.154 --> 34:27.487
do it differently, but...

34:28.731 --> 34:29.956
where I'm from,

34:29.958 --> 34:31.491
you make a deal, you keep it.

34:31.493 --> 34:33.426
And since I am on the most wanted list

34:33.428 --> 34:35.328
of every psycho who
wants your family dead,

34:35.330 --> 34:39.299
I guess I'm Team Mikaelson
whether I like it or not.

34:52.614 --> 34:56.081
Denne legatura.

35:04.192 --> 35:05.558
It's done.

35:05.560 --> 35:08.294
The ring's altered.

35:08.296 --> 35:11.264
You keep the benefits, minus the leash.

35:14.336 --> 35:17.504
Is this an apology or a thank you?

35:20.275 --> 35:21.941
I don't know.

35:24.300 --> 35:26.989
I'm not particularly good at either one.

35:42.664 --> 35:45.165
I managed to find an old friend.

35:45.167 --> 35:48.134
Or enemy, I can never really tell.

35:51.221 --> 35:53.922
Here's to a wretched day.

35:57.612 --> 35:59.612
A wretched day indeed.

36:04.749 --> 36:07.216
As soon as Hope is better, we'll leave.

36:08.156 --> 36:09.656
She's all that matters.

36:20.335 --> 36:21.901
Hey.

36:24.239 --> 36:26.840
I want to ask you something.

36:27.944 --> 36:29.844
In the woods,

36:29.847 --> 36:33.046
if Vincent hadn't found that loophole...

36:33.048 --> 36:36.349
what would you have done to those kids?

36:51.499 --> 36:54.133
Whatever I had to do.

36:57.005 --> 36:59.672
We have got to stop making it a habit

36:59.674 --> 37:02.508
of putting our family
lives ahead of others.

37:02.510 --> 37:03.843
I don't want that for myself,

37:03.845 --> 37:05.545
I don't want that for Hope.

37:13.989 --> 37:15.889
We have to do better.

37:37.189 --> 37:39.256
I know today was rough for you.

37:39.258 --> 37:42.025
Hey, at least we put an end to it.

37:43.929 --> 37:45.896
Kinney's dead.

37:51.003 --> 37:53.570
But...

37:53.572 --> 37:55.439
the thing they idolized...

37:55.441 --> 37:57.574
the Hollow...

37:57.576 --> 37:59.576
it must have wanted us there.

37:59.578 --> 38:02.245
It wanted to come into our world

38:02.247 --> 38:05.048
by anchoring itself to one of us.

38:05.884 --> 38:07.918
So that makes me wonder...

38:07.920 --> 38:10.087
did we end it?

38:10.089 --> 38:12.289
Or is it just getting started?

38:39.051 --> 38:42.285
You think it's gonna come after me?

38:42.287 --> 38:44.921
Marcel, I'm-a tell you, man.

38:44.923 --> 38:47.624
I wonder if it hasn't
already got to you.

38:50.229 --> 38:52.529
What did you see when
you was in the circle?

38:54.600 --> 38:56.733
Nothing.

38:59.071 --> 39:00.437
Not a thing.

39:44.049 --> 39:46.683
I hope you're right.

39:53.825 --> 39:56.793
That's the funny thing about
our city, though, Marcel.

39:56.795 --> 39:59.663
Nothing ever stays buried.

41:31.269 --> 41:34.257
No, no, no.

41:34.259 --> 41:36.293
It's here.

41:36.295 --> 41:39.696
The Hollow...

41:39.698 --> 41:41.164
it's here.
