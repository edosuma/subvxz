04:42.016 --> 04:43.016

04:43.917 --> 04:45.150
- Screwdriver?

04:46.453 --> 04:47.719
- Excuse me?

04:47.721 --> 04:49.454
- Your drink, is it?

04:53.394 --> 04:55.127
- It's orange juice.

04:56.997 --> 04:59.965
- You look like you could
use something stronger.

04:59.967 --> 05:02.534
- Yeah, you're probably right.

05:04.038 --> 05:05.704
- Do you not drink?

05:05.706 --> 05:08.607
- No, I do, just
not much anymore.

05:10.978 --> 05:13.578
- Let me guess,
you're one of those

05:13.580 --> 05:15.981
wily, unpredictable drunks.

05:15.983 --> 05:18.483
- It's a bit more complicated.

05:18.485 --> 05:21.153
- Oh, yeah, I pulled your card.

05:23.023 --> 05:24.823
It's okay though.

05:24.825 --> 05:27.993
I have a problem
with control myself.

05:30.564 --> 05:31.797
- I'm Brennan.

05:32.733 --> 05:33.733
- I know.

05:35.402 --> 05:36.402
- Right.

05:40.007 --> 05:42.674
- So you remind me of somebody.

05:44.278 --> 05:46.511
I can't place it though.

05:46.513 --> 05:47.846
Who do you get?

05:47.848 --> 05:49.481
- Who do I get?

05:49.483 --> 05:52.384
- Who do people
say you look like?

05:55.122 --> 05:57.189
- Um, I get Prince a lot.

05:58.359 --> 06:00.258
- Ha, yeah, that's it.

06:01.362 --> 06:03.729
Except you're a
little bit taller.

06:03.731 --> 06:06.164
Maybe a little less
- Black?

06:06.166 --> 06:07.166
- Exactly.

06:09.570 --> 06:10.702
Can you sing?

06:15.175 --> 06:17.676
That must be it then, Prince.

06:24.351 --> 06:26.852
Brennan, I've had a long day.

06:28.055 --> 06:30.689
Do you want to get out of here?

06:32.159 --> 06:33.625
- Um, yeah, sure.

06:36.897 --> 06:37.863
- Cool.

06:37.865 --> 06:39.431
Hey, before we go,

06:40.701 --> 06:44.770
I just want to make sure
we're on the same page.

06:46.006 --> 06:47.973
Two-fifty gets you a...

06:50.444 --> 06:52.511
Five hundred and I'll...

06:58.519 --> 06:59.985
And a thousand...

07:01.355 --> 07:05.056
But I'll do it for nine
hundred because you're cute

07:05.058 --> 07:07.559
and I want to sleep with you.

07:09.129 --> 07:10.695
- You're a hooker.

07:13.467 --> 07:15.801
- Where are your
manners, Brennan?

07:15.803 --> 07:17.536
I'm an entrepreneur.

07:21.809 --> 07:23.608
You don't look happy.

07:26.480 --> 07:28.713
What would make you happy?

07:43.564 --> 07:46.631
(melancholy guitar)

07:56.410 --> 07:59.144
- I'd like to check out, please.

08:00.447 --> 08:02.614
But my flight doesn't
leave til seven.

08:02.616 --> 08:03.815
Can I check my bag in?

08:03.817 --> 08:04.883
- Of course.

08:07.955 --> 08:11.022
(melancholy guitar)

08:38.284 --> 08:39.918
- This place reeks.

08:41.355 --> 08:42.888
- Smells like air freshener.

08:42.890 --> 08:44.890
- No, no, no, no,
no, not the hotel.

08:44.892 --> 08:48.126
This whole town, it's
like a pipe dream

08:48.128 --> 08:50.328
palace of desperation, you know?

08:50.330 --> 08:52.030
Oh my god, did you
just hear what I said?

08:52.032 --> 08:53.899
Pipe dream palace
of desperation.

08:53.901 --> 08:56.635
Now that is a song, that
is what he should be doing.

08:56.637 --> 08:58.336
Oh god, look at him.

08:58.338 --> 09:00.138
Can you imagine being him?

09:00.140 --> 09:01.373
- Yeah.

09:01.375 --> 09:04.042
- No, no, no, that is,
that is not for me.

09:04.044 --> 09:05.610
Or you, I mean look at us,

09:05.612 --> 09:08.847
we're flying first
class tonight, yes.

09:10.617 --> 09:12.784
Oh by the way, I am very sorry

09:12.786 --> 09:14.586
about that proposal yesterday.

09:14.588 --> 09:16.087
I thought it was gonna go.

09:16.089 --> 09:17.689
- You voted against it.

09:17.691 --> 09:20.992
- Well, yeah, who would have
thought one vote would matter?

09:20.994 --> 09:24.729
No, no, no, you know,
there'll be another one.

09:24.731 --> 09:26.965
- I don't really care about it.

09:26.967 --> 09:28.833
Well now, see,
that's the spirit.

09:28.835 --> 09:30.735
Yes, exactly, right?

09:30.737 --> 09:32.304
I mean you'll come up
with something better.

09:32.306 --> 09:34.773
That is why you
are a VeroTech man.

09:34.775 --> 09:36.041
- What?

09:36.043 --> 09:37.509
- A VeroTech man.

09:38.812 --> 09:42.747
I mean, listen, it's got a
great ring to it, VeroTech man.

09:42.749 --> 09:43.949
Come on, say it with me, say,

09:43.951 --> 09:45.684
I am a VeroTech man.

09:49.957 --> 09:51.556
Wait, where are you going?

09:51.558 --> 09:53.925
Hey, you wanna hang
before the flight tonight?

09:53.927 --> 09:54.927
Grab a...

10:16.083 --> 10:19.484
(brooding string music)

10:30.130 --> 10:33.965
- You're acting stupid,
like a little girl.

10:33.967 --> 10:35.600
- What?

10:35.602 --> 10:38.103
- Speak, Nora, use
your big kid mouth

10:38.105 --> 10:39.904
and tell me what
- You understand that?

10:39.906 --> 10:41.773
Does this speak to you?

10:41.775 --> 10:42.807
- Stop it!

10:42.809 --> 10:44.075
- You lied to me!

10:44.077 --> 10:45.810
You told me you were
done, you're not.

10:45.812 --> 10:47.078
So we are.

10:47.080 --> 10:48.813
- We're on vacation.

10:50.183 --> 10:52.250
I'm not gonna chase you.

10:56.657 --> 10:58.857
Why do you play these
stupid little games?

10:58.859 --> 11:00.291
I swear to god,
if you do it now,

11:00.293 --> 11:02.227
I'm gonna go back to the hotel,

11:02.229 --> 11:03.828
I'm gonna pack up my
shit, and that is that.

11:03.830 --> 11:04.830
- So go.

11:07.267 --> 11:10.168
- We came here for
you to celebrate.

11:10.170 --> 11:11.670
- Celebrate this.

13:35.348 --> 13:39.217

mean, appearance.

14:00.473 --> 14:03.842
I can't believe how
short your hair is.

14:03.844 --> 14:06.411
- What was your getaway about?

14:07.547 --> 14:09.314
- It's just, I can't
believe you're here,

14:09.316 --> 14:10.849
this doesn't happen.

14:10.851 --> 14:13.585
- You mean us running
into each other again?

14:13.587 --> 14:14.953
- Yeah, it's insane.

14:14.955 --> 14:16.187
- Yeah, it is.

14:22.195 --> 14:24.262
So when are you going back
- Grab a drink with me.

14:24.264 --> 14:25.697
- What?

14:25.699 --> 14:28.533
- Don't think of an
excuse or a way out, just,

14:28.535 --> 14:30.134
grab a drink with me.

14:33.340 --> 14:34.472
- Yeah.

14:34.474 --> 14:35.506
- Yeah?

14:35.508 --> 14:36.341
- Yeah, sure.

14:36.343 --> 14:37.343
- Really?

14:38.812 --> 14:39.812
Okay.

14:41.982 --> 14:44.782
(both laugh)

14:44.784 --> 14:46.284
- [Brennan] Okay.

14:49.055 --> 14:52.390
(upbeat country music)

15:07.307 --> 15:09.040
- You sure you have time?

15:09.042 --> 15:10.808
- You having second thoughts?

15:10.810 --> 15:14.979
- No, I was just, I
didn't want to keep you

15:14.981 --> 15:16.447
if you were meeting someone.

15:16.449 --> 15:18.783
- No, no, I've got
nowhere to be, you?

15:18.785 --> 15:20.351
- I'm pretty free.

15:27.460 --> 15:28.826
Last time we saw each other.

15:28.828 --> 15:30.361
- Your nephew was
getting baptized.

15:30.363 --> 15:31.529
- That's right.

15:31.531 --> 15:33.698
You were leaving
Seattle for Colorado.

15:33.700 --> 15:35.233
- And I missed my flight,

15:35.235 --> 15:36.868
so I ended up spending my last
day with you and your family,

15:36.870 --> 15:39.370
even though we both
knew it was over.

15:39.372 --> 15:41.606
- But we stood there together
pretending it wasn't.

15:41.608 --> 15:43.641
- Yeah, that wasn't
uncomfortable at all.

15:43.643 --> 15:45.076
- Not at all.

15:45.078 --> 15:46.078
- No.

15:49.049 --> 15:50.882
- I've seen your Facebook.

15:50.884 --> 15:52.216
- We're not friends.

15:52.218 --> 15:54.218
- We'll always be friends.

15:54.220 --> 15:57.755
But you were right, on
Facebook, we are not friends.

15:57.757 --> 15:59.590
- So how did you see?

15:59.592 --> 16:02.694
- Well, your page isn't
completely private.

16:02.696 --> 16:07.098
So I can see assorted
pictures you've posted.

16:07.100 --> 16:08.533
- That's creepy.

16:08.535 --> 16:10.535
- It's a little creepy.

16:12.372 --> 16:16.574
But you haven't posted in
a while, not since this.

16:16.576 --> 16:18.843
But I gather you're not married
or you don't have any kids,

16:18.845 --> 16:20.845
or if you do, you're
embarrassed by them,

16:20.847 --> 16:22.780
so you don't post any pictures.

16:22.782 --> 16:25.049
- They're just really ugly.

16:25.051 --> 16:26.884
- You should see mine.

16:26.886 --> 16:28.753
They're in the car
waiting for me.

16:28.755 --> 16:31.222
It's okay, I left it running.

16:33.259 --> 16:35.927
(she chuckles)

16:39.366 --> 16:41.232
- You still in Seattle?

16:41.234 --> 16:42.234
- Mmhmm.

16:45.005 --> 16:46.337
Remember when you lived there?

16:46.339 --> 16:47.538
- How could I forget?

16:47.540 --> 16:49.741
- And you had that
ceramic garden gnome?

16:49.743 --> 16:50.575
- Norman.

16:50.577 --> 16:52.443
- Norman, yes!

16:52.445 --> 16:55.079
Oh, he was horrifying
with those red eyes

16:55.081 --> 16:57.348
and that geriatric smile.

16:57.350 --> 16:58.883
- I used to put him
in the refrigerator.

16:58.885 --> 17:01.486
- Yes, I would go for a beer
and find this fucking gnome

17:01.488 --> 17:02.787
waiting for me.

17:05.759 --> 17:08.159
- How come you never called?

17:09.896 --> 17:12.195
- What would I have said?

17:12.198 --> 17:14.598
- I don't know, any of this?

17:16.669 --> 17:18.136
- Hmm, I don't know,
maybe for the same reason

17:18.137 --> 17:21.138
you didn't show up to
my sister's wedding.

17:21.141 --> 17:25.009
- You guys should feel
these for a couple days.

17:25.011 --> 17:26.077
- Thank you.

17:27.180 --> 17:30.114
You don't have any
place to be, right?

17:32.452 --> 17:34.052
- Right.
- Right.

17:38.591 --> 17:39.591
- Whew.

17:46.733 --> 17:49.300
- What's your favorite memory?

17:50.837 --> 17:53.504
- What, favorite
memory of all time?

17:53.506 --> 17:54.506
- Of us.

17:57.744 --> 17:58.744
- Uh, wow.

18:02.582 --> 18:05.383
Okay, I came to your apartment

18:05.385 --> 18:07.418
because we were going to dinner,

18:07.420 --> 18:11.689
and you had made up this lame
excuse about no reservations

18:11.691 --> 18:13.558
and that you were flustered,

18:13.560 --> 18:16.327
and then I went into your
room to grab your coat

18:16.329 --> 18:19.230
and you had rose
petals scattered,

18:20.433 --> 18:22.934
and candles burning, and this

18:24.037 --> 18:26.204
Italian meal that
you said you cooked.

18:26.206 --> 18:28.473
- It was Olive Garden.

18:28.475 --> 18:29.475
- I know.

18:30.143 --> 18:31.143
- Yeah.

18:32.145 --> 18:33.311
That was the moment when I knew

18:33.313 --> 18:37.148
I could never live
without you in my life.

18:37.150 --> 18:38.216
- But you did.

18:38.218 --> 18:39.517
- No, I didn't.

18:40.587 --> 18:41.819
You were always
there like a ghost,

18:41.821 --> 18:44.889
haunting any
relationship after you.

18:55.068 --> 18:56.100
- Your turn.

19:01.107 --> 19:04.575
- We were working at the
bar, it was almost Christmas,

19:04.577 --> 19:07.478
I think we'd been seeing
each other for about a month.

19:07.480 --> 19:10.148
And you'd just gotten off
and left the building.

19:10.150 --> 19:12.216
- It was so cold that day.

19:12.218 --> 19:14.685
- And I watched you walk
across the parking lot,

19:14.687 --> 19:16.654
toward your minivan.

19:16.656 --> 19:18.890
- [Nora] I hated that car.

19:20.260 --> 19:22.226
- I still had people in my
section, but I didn't care,

19:22.228 --> 19:23.794
I had to do something.

19:23.796 --> 19:27.165
- So you ran outside,
took off your hat.

19:27.167 --> 19:28.332
- I grabbed you.

19:28.334 --> 19:30.668
- And you kissed me.

19:30.670 --> 19:33.804
- I told you merry Christmas.

19:33.806 --> 19:38.042
- And then you turned
around and just walked away.

19:39.445 --> 19:42.547
I didn't breathe for minutes.

19:42.549 --> 19:44.782
- I'm glad you didn't die.

19:44.784 --> 19:45.784
- Me too!

19:46.786 --> 19:49.387

would be awkward.

32:39.692 --> 32:40.924

32:40.926 --> 32:43.226

dreams and memories

32:43.228 --> 32:46.363
associate to a particular color.

32:46.365 --> 32:47.731
- Blue.

32:48.667 --> 32:49.766

35:57.990 --> 35:59.890
- I don't sound
like Darth Vader.

35:59.892 --> 36:01.825
- Yeah, you know
what, you kind of do.

36:01.827 --> 36:03.059
- Yes, you do.

36:04.730 --> 36:08.465
- All right, so, I'm guessing
a couple more vodka Red Bulls?

36:08.467 --> 36:10.433
- Yeah, I think I need one now.

36:10.435 --> 36:11.501
- Thank you.

36:13.071 --> 36:14.071
I like her.

36:15.741 --> 36:18.074
You know what we should do?

36:19.211 --> 36:21.211
- Does it involve going
back to your motel room?

36:21.213 --> 36:23.680
- No, we should write a poem.

36:23.682 --> 36:24.748
- Or we should write a poem.

36:24.750 --> 36:25.982
- To Jessie.

36:25.984 --> 36:26.983
- You want to write a
poem to the waitress

36:26.985 --> 36:28.818
we just met?
- Yes, I do.

36:28.820 --> 36:30.187
- Okay.

36:30.189 --> 36:31.922
What do you wanna say?

36:31.924 --> 36:33.990
- Dear Jessie, thank you

36:35.494 --> 36:37.460
for our vodka Red Bull.

36:38.564 --> 36:41.464
- Nora thinks that
you're so cool.

36:42.501 --> 36:45.402
- I'm sorry Brennan
was so creepy.

36:46.438 --> 36:49.239
We are too wound
up to be sleepy.

36:50.876 --> 36:54.244
- We still are going back
to your room, aren't we?

36:54.246 --> 36:56.513
- You're our new favorite girl.

36:56.515 --> 36:57.581
- You're my new favorite girl.

36:57.583 --> 36:59.649
- I'm not new, I'm worn.

37:05.290 --> 37:07.757
- I can move back to Seattle.

37:10.162 --> 37:11.995
- You live in Colorado.

37:11.997 --> 37:16.366
- I can move to Seattle and
fly to Colorado for work.

37:16.368 --> 37:18.235
Unless you wanted to move to
Colorado for a couple years,

37:18.237 --> 37:19.869
but I think you'd hate it there.

37:19.871 --> 37:22.606
Leaving your sister and parents?

37:23.542 --> 37:25.442
We could make it work.

37:27.846 --> 37:29.679
I could make it work.

37:33.185 --> 37:36.019
- Maybe we could just
stay in Nashville.

37:36.021 --> 37:39.756
You can sing again and
I can play the piano.

37:51.970 --> 37:53.937
Where are those drinks?

38:06.952 --> 38:10.520
(melancholy string music)

38:27.873 --> 38:30.340
- Can I take you somewhere?

38:30.342 --> 38:31.308
- You already have.

38:31.310 --> 38:32.310
- Come on.

38:56.735 --> 38:57.735
Come on.

39:04.710 --> 39:06.443
- What are we doing?

39:07.913 --> 39:09.579
What is this place?

39:19.057 --> 39:21.157
- Still remember?

39:21.159 --> 39:23.393
- Brennan, no I don't want to
- Hey, come on, come on.

39:23.395 --> 39:24.694
You're so good.

39:25.797 --> 39:27.664
- Your memory is of a
girl seven years ago

39:27.666 --> 39:29.032
that's not still me.

39:29.034 --> 39:30.367
- Hey, I think it is.

39:30.369 --> 39:31.801
- You're the musician
who is now working

39:31.803 --> 39:33.436
some bullshit nine to five job,

39:33.438 --> 39:36.706
I should be pushing you
onto a stage somewhere.

39:36.708 --> 39:39.075
- Just, give it a try.

39:39.077 --> 39:40.243
- This is embarrassing.

39:40.245 --> 39:41.711
- It is not, come on.

39:41.713 --> 39:44.013
(grunts)

39:44.015 --> 39:45.281
- Then you do it.

39:45.283 --> 39:47.183
- I would if I knew
what the hell to do.

39:47.185 --> 39:51.121
- You press your fingers
down until it sounds right.

39:51.123 --> 39:53.390
- Oh, sounds easy enough.

39:53.392 --> 39:54.691
Give it a shot.

39:56.061 --> 39:57.061
- No.

39:57.863 --> 39:59.629
I don't want to.

39:59.631 --> 40:00.631
- Please.

40:01.833 --> 40:03.166
Please, for me.

40:04.536 --> 40:05.536
No?

40:07.339 --> 40:08.339
Please, hm?

40:14.780 --> 40:18.515
- Fine, but I'm gonna
murder your ear drums.

40:19.751 --> 40:22.419
- I'm willing to take the risk.

40:24.856 --> 40:25.822
- Hmmph.

40:25.824 --> 40:26.824
- Hmmph.

40:32.564 --> 40:35.198
- What do you want to hear?

40:35.200 --> 40:38.168
- I don't know,
something cheerful.

40:39.838 --> 40:42.906
Or suitably depressing,
your choice.

40:44.543 --> 40:46.543
- Prepare yourself
for disappointment.

40:46.545 --> 40:47.710
- Oh, I have.

40:52.417 --> 40:56.052
- I don't remember
when I wrote this, but,

40:56.054 --> 40:57.987
I called it Hindenburg.

40:59.357 --> 41:01.424
- After the airship?

41:01.426 --> 41:02.725
- What airship?

47:27.579 --> 47:29.579
- Here, it's like this.

47:36.454 --> 47:37.753
But way cooler.

47:38.790 --> 47:41.090
- No, that was pretty good.

47:41.893 --> 47:42.893
- I'm Roy.

48:18.596 --> 48:19.662
- Thank you.

48:21.099 --> 48:23.232
- [Brennan] And they called
him something like Conrad,

48:23.234 --> 48:27.303
so he's either gonna be a
rockstar or a mathematician.

48:27.305 --> 48:29.138
Hey, if we had a kid,

48:29.974 --> 48:32.575
what would we name him?

48:32.577 --> 48:34.710
- I don't like this game.

48:36.080 --> 48:37.680
- I was just messing around.

48:37.682 --> 48:38.682
- I know.

48:39.684 --> 48:41.350
- Are you okay?

48:41.352 --> 48:42.418
- Yeah, why?

48:44.255 --> 48:45.321
- No reason.

48:49.861 --> 48:52.094
- What do you hate about me?

48:52.096 --> 48:53.362
- What do I hate about you?

48:53.364 --> 48:55.698
- What do you hate about me?

48:55.700 --> 48:57.166
- Nothing.

48:57.168 --> 49:00.469
- We broke up once, you've
hated me more than once, why?

49:00.471 --> 49:02.171
- I don't know.

49:02.173 --> 49:04.440
- I smoke, you hate cigarettes.

49:04.442 --> 49:05.908
- [Brennan] Yeah, I do.

49:05.910 --> 49:07.410
- That's one thing.

49:07.412 --> 49:08.878
- There's a whole list of
things I love about you.

49:08.880 --> 49:09.880
- Pfff.

49:12.283 --> 49:16.485
I kissed that guy on my
23rd birthday and you saw.

49:16.487 --> 49:18.955
- Yeah, it was a long time ago.

49:18.957 --> 49:21.290
What are you doing, Nora?

49:21.292 --> 49:23.859
- I don't know what I'm doing.

49:27.432 --> 49:28.631
- Do we really need more drinks?

49:28.633 --> 49:30.866
- Should I just order one?

49:31.669 --> 49:33.436
- No, no, it's fine.

49:33.438 --> 49:34.837
- Great, thanks.

49:41.312 --> 49:43.713
I've been with someone
for a long time.

49:43.715 --> 49:44.715
- I know.

49:45.650 --> 49:46.650
Facebook.

49:49.187 --> 49:50.686
- How'd you feel?

49:52.623 --> 49:56.892
- How did I feel knowing
that you were with him?

49:56.894 --> 49:58.361
- I guess.

49:58.363 --> 50:00.496
- [Brennan] I don't know.

50:00.498 --> 50:01.998
- You don't know?

50:03.368 --> 50:04.967
When it comes to emotions,
I think you always know

50:04.969 --> 50:06.802
exactly how you feel.

50:10.008 --> 50:13.709
- I guess I wondered
what it felt like.

50:13.711 --> 50:15.044
- What?

50:15.046 --> 50:17.713
- To be with you for that long.

50:19.350 --> 50:22.251
- He said it was like
driving in oncoming traffic.

50:22.253 --> 50:25.821
Each night you don't
know how you survive.

50:27.525 --> 50:30.426
- I guess one day he
didn't get so lucky.

50:30.428 --> 50:32.228
- He lied to me.

50:32.230 --> 50:33.629
- Somebody else?

50:34.899 --> 50:36.365
- No, with pills.

50:38.970 --> 50:40.836
- But you never?
- No, are you kidding?

50:40.838 --> 50:43.472
No, and I didn't think
that he would have, either.

50:43.474 --> 50:46.709
But, yeah, looking
back it made sense.

50:49.847 --> 50:53.249
- I would not do drugs
behind your back.

50:54.852 --> 50:56.419
I wouldn't.

50:56.421 --> 50:58.087
I wouldn't lie to you either.

50:58.089 --> 50:59.321
- Really?
- Uh huh.

50:59.323 --> 51:02.158
- Oh, well then you
would be a robot.

51:02.160 --> 51:05.661
Everybody lies, everybody
does fucked up stuff.

51:05.663 --> 51:09.832

55:55.152 --> 55:56.152
- Sorry.

55:58.689 --> 55:59.689
- Hah.

56:12.536 --> 56:13.535
Where are you going?

56:13.537 --> 56:14.537
- Anywhere.

56:15.840 --> 56:17.072
- Don't be stupid.

56:17.074 --> 56:20.309
- I'm not being stupid,
I'm being pissed off.

56:20.311 --> 56:21.744
- Oh, whatever.

56:21.746 --> 56:24.680
- You know what, you do this.

56:24.682 --> 56:26.181
- I do what?

56:26.183 --> 56:27.883
- You get close, you cut
me off, you push me away.

56:27.885 --> 56:29.651
- I'm not pushing you away.

56:29.653 --> 56:31.520
- Did you fuck that guy?

56:31.522 --> 56:32.888
- Did I fuck what guy?

56:32.890 --> 56:33.890
- You know.

56:35.459 --> 56:36.392
- I don't.

56:36.394 --> 56:38.861
- The guy you were talking to.

56:40.197 --> 56:42.931
- Did I fuck a guy five
minutes after talking to him

56:42.933 --> 56:44.366
at the bar?

56:44.368 --> 56:46.935
- It wouldn't be your first
bathroom this weekend.

56:46.937 --> 56:49.571
- Is that what you think of me?

56:54.011 --> 56:56.979
You know, and then not answering
doesn't make it better.

56:56.981 --> 56:58.213
- You know what
I hate about you?

56:58.215 --> 56:59.014
- What, that you
think I'm a whore?

56:59.016 --> 57:00.482
- That I love you!

57:00.484 --> 57:03.185
- You haven't seen me in seven
years, you don't know me.

57:03.187 --> 57:05.921
- I know how destroyed
I was the last time,

57:05.923 --> 57:08.390
and I hate, I hate
that I love you again.

57:08.392 --> 57:09.925
- You're drunk.

57:09.927 --> 57:13.662
- I hate knowing that if this
all ends, that you'll be fine.

57:13.664 --> 57:17.332
You'll just go back home,
you'll walk into the old bar,

57:17.334 --> 57:19.368
and you'll wake up with one of
those plaid-wearing dirtbags

57:19.370 --> 57:20.402
leaning against the pool table,

57:20.404 --> 57:21.970
he'll come up and buy a drink,

57:21.972 --> 57:23.972
follow you back to your place,
you'll take off your pants,

57:23.974 --> 57:26.708
but you're too insecure
to take off your top.

57:26.710 --> 57:28.110
And I don't know
what hurts me more,

57:28.112 --> 57:30.412
knowing that you'll
be thinking about me

57:30.414 --> 57:32.214
or that you won't be.

57:39.256 --> 57:40.322
Nora, wait.

57:40.324 --> 57:41.523
- [Nora] No, fuck that.

57:41.525 --> 57:42.791
- Look, you're upset.

57:42.793 --> 57:44.092
- Oh, yeah, you're
fucking observant.

57:44.094 --> 57:46.895
- Let's just cool off.
- Fuck you!

58:00.444 --> 58:02.945
(sad guitar)

59:42.813 --> 59:45.280
(alarm buzz)

59:48.586 --> 59:50.652
- We should probably get up.

59:50.654 --> 59:51.654
- Why?

59:54.992 --> 59:56.925
- Because the
alarm is going off.

59:56.927 --> 59:58.994
- I didn't set an alarm.

01:00:01.031 --> 01:00:02.097
- It's noon.

01:00:08.105 --> 01:00:10.439
- No, I just, I'm hungover.

01:00:12.176 --> 01:00:15.510
I've been hungover
for like a week now.

01:00:20.718 --> 01:00:24.386
I don't really know
what to say about that.

01:00:30.761 --> 01:00:31.761
Maybe...

01:00:34.398 --> 01:00:36.398
Yeah, maybe, we'll see.

01:00:41.338 --> 01:00:42.904
I better go, okay.

01:00:44.475 --> 01:00:46.108
Yeah, you too, bye.

01:00:56.887 --> 01:00:59.221
- I, uh, picked them myself,

01:00:59.223 --> 01:01:02.057
well, I didn't pick
them, you know.

01:01:02.059 --> 01:01:04.960
- Yeah, well,
they're interesting.

01:01:06.397 --> 01:01:08.296
Oh, and a card.
- Yeah.

01:01:42.900 --> 01:01:44.733
- Thank you.

01:01:44.735 --> 01:01:46.201
- You're welcome.

01:01:59.016 --> 01:02:02.184
(exciting drum beat)

01:02:10.227 --> 01:02:11.460
- You sure you don't
want something?

01:02:11.462 --> 01:02:12.462
- Bleh, no.

01:02:13.230 --> 01:02:14.930
I still feel queasy.

01:02:14.932 --> 01:02:16.565
Looking at you
makes me feel sick.

01:02:16.567 --> 01:02:18.066
- Hey.

01:02:18.068 --> 01:02:19.801
- Not you, the food.

01:02:23.941 --> 01:02:24.940
- Is that better?

01:02:24.942 --> 01:02:27.175
- No, no, no don't eat me.

01:02:30.414 --> 01:02:31.847
- Ah!

01:02:31.849 --> 01:02:33.915
Gross, I don't eat meat.

01:02:40.090 --> 01:02:41.356
I think I blacked
out last night,

01:02:41.358 --> 01:02:43.658
but I remember us fighting.

01:02:45.796 --> 01:02:48.897
- We weren't fighting,
we were arguing.

01:02:48.899 --> 01:02:51.333
Disagreeing if you will.

01:02:51.335 --> 01:02:52.335
- Oh.

01:02:53.871 --> 01:02:54.871
Okay.

01:03:01.111 --> 01:03:02.410
- So you leave tomorrow?

01:03:02.412 --> 01:03:05.147
- I don't want to talk about it.

01:03:05.149 --> 01:03:07.048
- It's our last night.

01:03:09.453 --> 01:03:11.520
- So let's not waste it.

01:03:12.890 --> 01:03:13.890
Come on.

01:03:23.901 --> 01:03:25.400
Ha, come up here.

01:03:34.711 --> 01:03:36.511
- I'll fall.

01:03:36.513 --> 01:03:39.214
- Uh, I don't think
the crash'll hurt.

01:03:39.216 --> 01:03:40.215
Come on.

01:03:40.217 --> 01:03:41.550
- White flamingo?

01:03:41.552 --> 01:03:42.951
- It's all they had.

01:03:42.953 --> 01:03:44.553
- You're trying to
murder my liver?

01:03:44.555 --> 01:03:46.188
- How romantic is
dying together?

01:03:46.190 --> 01:03:47.956
- It's not as romantic
as living together.

01:03:47.958 --> 01:03:51.026
- Fine, I will be
your opening act.

01:03:51.028 --> 01:03:54.329
- Whoa, did you just
ask me to move in?

01:03:56.867 --> 01:03:58.500
- Yeah, yeah I did.

01:03:59.837 --> 01:04:03.305
- Haha, I do not know how you
get me to do these things.

01:04:03.307 --> 01:04:05.140
Okay, get me a ukelele.

01:04:05.142 --> 01:04:07.976
- What, pull it
out of my pocket?

01:04:09.880 --> 01:04:10.880
All right.

01:04:44.181 --> 01:04:45.447

her doesn't help.

Emory Blaine, 1931.

01:05:43.307 --> 01:05:46.141
Beloved by his wife, Emily.

01:05:46.143 --> 01:05:49.077
Beloved by his murderer, Emily,

01:05:49.079 --> 01:05:50.612
who poisoned his
oatmeal one night

01:05:50.614 --> 01:05:54.516
because she secretly feared
he was having an affair

01:05:54.518 --> 01:05:57.852
with Katherine Johnson,
whom she also...

01:06:00.390 --> 01:06:02.791
- Yeah, but he got her back.

01:06:04.194 --> 01:06:06.628
- By haunting her
everyday for five years

01:06:06.630 --> 01:06:10.532
until she went crazy and
jumped from a window.

01:06:11.601 --> 01:06:12.601
- What?

01:06:17.107 --> 01:06:19.174
Have some respect.

01:06:19.176 --> 01:06:20.176
- Sorry.

01:06:27.451 --> 01:06:31.686
- You know, sometimes I see
ghosts of ex-boyfriends.

01:06:32.823 --> 01:06:35.190
I'll wake up, in the
middle of the night,

01:06:35.192 --> 01:06:36.691
and they'll be standing
at the edge of my bed

01:06:36.693 --> 01:06:39.194
in the shadows, watching me.

01:06:39.196 --> 01:06:40.528
- They're not dead.

01:06:40.530 --> 01:06:43.198
- No, but when I
finally do wake up,

01:06:43.200 --> 01:06:45.967
I have to text
them to make sure.

01:06:45.969 --> 01:06:47.268
- That's gotta be
an awkward text.

01:06:47.270 --> 01:06:49.337
Hey, it's me, long time,

01:06:50.474 --> 01:06:52.240
by any chance did you die?

01:06:52.242 --> 01:06:55.210
If so, did you
haunt me last night?

01:06:56.646 --> 01:06:57.646
- Vodka.

01:07:03.286 --> 01:07:05.587
Makes letting them go harder.

01:07:05.589 --> 01:07:10.392
- I never got a text, so
I guess you never saw me.

01:07:10.394 --> 01:07:11.993
- I did.

01:07:11.995 --> 01:07:14.229
Two days ago in Nashville.

01:07:17.534 --> 01:07:20.935
(soft guitar strumming)

01:08:52.895 --> 01:08:55.296
(sniffling)

01:09:18.455 --> 01:09:20.188
- Whatcha doing?

01:09:20.189 --> 01:09:22.122
- Self-deprecating.

01:09:22.125 --> 01:09:23.258
- About what?

01:09:26.696 --> 01:09:27.696
- Being 30.

01:09:31.667 --> 01:09:35.904
I'm drunk, in a house of
judgment and forgiveness,

01:09:37.040 --> 01:09:39.207
so I thought I would
evaluate my life choices

01:09:39.209 --> 01:09:41.408
as I approach 30.

01:09:41.411 --> 01:09:43.144
- 30 is still young.

01:09:44.147 --> 01:09:46.613
- Not if I want to have kids.

01:09:47.716 --> 01:09:50.285
If I want three,
I gotta start now.

01:09:50.287 --> 01:09:52.854
- Oh, are you propositioning me?

01:09:52.856 --> 01:09:54.589
- No, I was talking.

01:09:57.294 --> 01:09:59.761
- I know, I was just kidding.

01:10:00.931 --> 01:10:03.064
- Yeah, well you have
the freedom, as a guy,

01:10:03.066 --> 01:10:04.699
to kid about that,
because truth be told

01:10:04.701 --> 01:10:08.269
you can be 50, decide
you want a kid,

01:10:08.271 --> 01:10:11.139
and knock up some young girl.

01:10:11.141 --> 01:10:14.108
- Yeah, I'm sure
that's easy to do.

01:10:16.479 --> 01:10:19.881
- I don't know why I'm
thinking about this.

01:10:19.883 --> 01:10:21.616
The future is scary.

01:10:23.486 --> 01:10:24.486
It's heavy.

01:10:27.757 --> 01:10:30.825
You know, I'm the only one back
home who doesn't have a kid.

01:10:30.827 --> 01:10:34.395
- Yeah, but you've got a job,
one that you actually enjoy.

01:10:34.397 --> 01:10:36.965
In this economy that's
very impressive.

01:10:36.967 --> 01:10:41.936
- Everyone thinks David and
I are gonna get married.

01:10:41.938 --> 01:10:45.340
I get to go home and
destroy that image.

01:10:53.250 --> 01:10:56.451
I'll figure it all out tomorrow.

01:10:56.453 --> 01:10:58.152
- Tomorrow?

01:10:58.154 --> 01:11:00.788
- I'll fly home, quit drinking,

01:11:01.925 --> 01:11:04.993
go to the gym, and
then make a plan.

01:11:08.765 --> 01:11:13.001
- Don't you think it was fate
that we ran into each other?

01:11:16.706 --> 01:11:17.706
- Yeah.

01:11:19.276 --> 01:11:20.276
- So?

01:11:33.223 --> 01:11:34.223
- So.

01:11:36.459 --> 01:11:37.859
- What about us?

01:11:39.696 --> 01:11:42.597
- I'll fly into the rain and
you'll fly into the snow.

01:11:42.599 --> 01:11:45.466
- It doesn't snow in July.

01:11:45.468 --> 01:11:47.035
- I feel like it
always snows there.

01:11:47.037 --> 01:11:49.437
- What did you do to me?

01:11:49.439 --> 01:11:50.305
- Nothing.

01:11:50.307 --> 01:11:51.839
- Yeah, but everything.

01:11:51.841 --> 01:11:53.308
Last time it took me a
year to get over you.

01:11:53.310 --> 01:11:56.277
365 days with your face tattooed
on the back of my eyelids.

01:11:56.279 --> 01:11:57.812
And all the time, my
brain going crazy,

01:11:57.814 --> 01:11:59.614
wondering who you're
with, what you're doing,

01:11:59.616 --> 01:12:01.115
whether you're happy.

01:12:01.117 --> 01:12:04.752
- You do remember that you
broke up with me last time?

01:12:04.754 --> 01:12:06.020
- You forced me to.

01:12:06.022 --> 01:12:08.122
- Oh, yes, I put a
gun to your head,

01:12:08.124 --> 01:12:11.526
and I said, Brennan,
please, please dump me.

01:12:11.528 --> 01:12:13.628
- We were living on a lifeboat
that was slowly sinking.

01:12:13.630 --> 01:12:15.063
If I didn't get off,
we were gonna drown.

01:12:15.065 --> 01:12:16.631
- I don't remember ever
going to the ocean.

01:12:16.633 --> 01:12:18.399
- I was being metaphorical,
and we did go once.

01:12:18.401 --> 01:12:20.568
- Brennan, let's not do this.

01:12:20.570 --> 01:12:22.103
- What?

01:12:22.105 --> 01:12:25.039
- Get all intense and shit.

01:12:25.041 --> 01:12:26.574
Not now, not tonight.

01:12:26.576 --> 01:12:29.577
I just want to live
in this moment.

01:12:29.579 --> 01:12:31.346
(sigh)

01:12:31.348 --> 01:12:32.847
- Don't sigh like that.

01:12:32.849 --> 01:12:35.116
- When you get
scared, all right,

01:12:35.118 --> 01:12:36.384
you think about the future

01:12:36.386 --> 01:12:37.218
but you don't want
to talk about it,

01:12:37.220 --> 01:12:38.419
that's a contradiction.

01:12:38.421 --> 01:12:39.787
- You're not an
open book yourself.

01:12:39.789 --> 01:12:41.089
You get scared, too.

01:12:41.091 --> 01:12:42.357
Why?

01:12:42.359 --> 01:12:44.559
Because the future is
fucking unpredictable

01:12:44.561 --> 01:12:47.328
and it is scary as hell.

01:12:47.330 --> 01:12:49.897
Yes, I'm complicated.

01:12:49.899 --> 01:12:51.833
I'm fucked up, I'm screwed up.

01:12:51.835 --> 01:12:55.336
But you walked away last
time because of this fear.

01:12:55.338 --> 01:12:58.039
You got terrified and you
couldn't handle the pressure

01:12:58.041 --> 01:13:00.241
because it was
too tough for you.

01:13:00.243 --> 01:13:03.311
You quit singing because of it.

01:13:03.313 --> 01:13:05.780
Are you happy at your job?

01:13:05.782 --> 01:13:07.815
Are you happy at your job?
- No.

01:13:07.817 --> 01:13:09.884
- Do you want to be a singer?

01:13:09.886 --> 01:13:11.185
- I don't know.

01:13:11.187 --> 01:13:12.720
- Do you want to be a singer?
- I don't know.

01:13:12.722 --> 01:13:13.855
- Do you want to be a singer?
- I don't know, I don't know.

01:13:13.857 --> 01:13:15.056
- Do you want to be a singer?
- Yes!

01:13:15.058 --> 01:13:18.025
- Then stop being a
fucking pussy, Brennan.

01:13:18.027 --> 01:13:19.927
Stop getting frightened
and work for what you want,

01:13:19.929 --> 01:13:22.563
even if it's gonna be
fucking awful at times.

01:13:22.565 --> 01:13:24.766
- Well, what about you?

01:13:24.768 --> 01:13:26.834
- I'm figuring that out.

01:13:33.176 --> 01:13:37.145
I don't want to do this,
I don't want to fight.

01:13:39.149 --> 01:13:43.217
Just, can you enjoy me
like I want to enjoy you?

01:13:45.155 --> 01:13:46.788
Let's just do that.

01:13:47.690 --> 01:13:48.690
Okay?

01:13:51.561 --> 01:13:54.595
- I guess we could go get drunk.

01:13:54.597 --> 01:13:56.364
- We're good at that.

01:14:05.141 --> 01:14:09.377
♪ Look away, look
away, look away now ♪

01:14:10.447 --> 01:14:13.781
♪ Look away, look away now ♪

01:14:13.783 --> 01:14:17.452
♪ Now, before it costs you ♪

01:14:19.656 --> 01:14:21.956
- What do you want me to say?

01:14:21.958 --> 01:14:24.992
I know what you want me to say.

01:14:24.994 --> 01:14:27.662
I just wanna make out with you.

01:14:28.498 --> 01:14:31.132
Eh, no, I don't like P.D.A.

01:14:31.134 --> 01:14:32.300
- Since when?

01:14:33.636 --> 01:14:36.037
- Since people were staring.

01:14:39.576 --> 01:14:41.375
- You look miserable.

01:14:44.914 --> 01:14:47.648
(silly moaning)

01:15:03.399 --> 01:15:06.634
- So, we've talked about what
we hate about each other.

01:15:06.636 --> 01:15:08.469
Let's get into some more meat.

01:15:08.471 --> 01:15:10.671
What is your biggest
flaw, Brennan?

01:15:10.673 --> 01:15:11.506
- Biggest flaw?

01:15:11.508 --> 01:15:12.974
You tell me.

01:15:12.976 --> 01:15:15.810
- This is a moment of
interpersonal reflection.

01:15:15.812 --> 01:15:16.812
Go.

01:15:17.680 --> 01:15:20.081
- I'd say I have two.

01:15:20.083 --> 01:15:21.582
The first is I
can't concentrate.

01:15:21.584 --> 01:15:25.753
You give me scissors it looks
like I cut with my toes.

01:15:25.755 --> 01:15:27.221
- [Nora] And two?

01:15:28.658 --> 01:15:31.058
- I'm obsessed with using
my cell phone at the urinal,

01:15:31.060 --> 01:15:35.663
and it's had disastrous
results on several occasions.

01:15:35.665 --> 01:15:39.000
- You're never taking
my phone anywhere.

01:15:39.002 --> 01:15:43.638
- In my next life, I'm
coming back as a rockstar.

01:15:43.640 --> 01:15:46.340
Perform on stage,
write tragic love songs

01:15:46.342 --> 01:15:48.442
about all my fucked
up relationships,

01:15:48.444 --> 01:15:52.113
and have 16-year-old
kids recite in unison.

01:15:54.484 --> 01:15:56.350
In your next life, who
are you coming back as?

01:15:56.352 --> 01:15:57.652
The president?

01:15:57.654 --> 01:15:59.120
- Your boyfriend.

01:16:11.167 --> 01:16:12.667
You turned quiet.

01:16:14.671 --> 01:16:15.836
- It's been a long time

01:16:15.838 --> 01:16:18.973
since anyone has
treated me like this.

01:16:20.610 --> 01:16:23.778
(pulsing rock music)

01:16:26.416 --> 01:16:27.982
- All right, fine.

01:16:33.923 --> 01:16:35.189
(coughing)

01:16:35.191 --> 01:16:37.124
Oh that's good, real good.

01:16:37.126 --> 01:16:40.261
(pulsing rock music)

01:17:23.306 --> 01:17:24.672
- What's it called?
- Oh.

01:17:24.674 --> 01:17:25.840
- Let me see.

01:17:26.976 --> 01:17:27.908
- This is going to
be the greatest song

01:17:27.910 --> 01:17:30.044
ever written on a napkin.

01:17:38.454 --> 01:17:41.389
- I need a, I need cigarettes.

01:17:41.391 --> 01:17:42.523
- Oh, we can leave.

01:17:42.525 --> 01:17:45.326
- No, I have a full drink.

01:17:45.328 --> 01:17:46.961
- I think there's a
store on the next block.

01:17:46.963 --> 01:17:49.430
- Thank you, Brennan.

01:17:49.432 --> 01:17:50.965
- Okay.

01:17:50.967 --> 01:17:51.967
- Okay.

01:18:05.948 --> 01:18:06.948
- Thanks.

01:18:09.952 --> 01:18:14.188
- Hot damn, what a surprise
to find you still here.

01:18:16.159 --> 01:18:17.591
- So you haven't left?

01:18:17.593 --> 01:18:20.728
- No no no, I guess
Nashville has consumed us.

01:18:20.730 --> 01:18:22.296
- What about your
first class flights?

01:18:22.298 --> 01:18:26.534
- I traded it in for an
economy tomorrow morning, yes.

01:18:27.704 --> 01:18:31.205
Oh, she is sucking
the life out of me.

01:18:31.207 --> 01:18:33.774
Yeah, I think I'm in love.

01:18:33.776 --> 01:18:35.076
Or I don't know,
what's that feeling

01:18:35.078 --> 01:18:37.945
when your dick's always hard?

01:18:37.947 --> 01:18:40.214
Anyway, what have
you been doing?

01:18:40.216 --> 01:18:42.249
Drinking, getting lost.

01:18:42.251 --> 01:18:45.319
- Yeah, yeah, what's her name?

01:18:45.321 --> 01:18:46.321
- Nora.

01:18:47.523 --> 01:18:49.924
- Nora, okay, now that
sounds like the name

01:18:49.926 --> 01:18:53.094
of my grandmother's
girlfriend, Nora.

01:18:54.464 --> 01:18:56.163
Anyway, look, make sure
you are on an early flight

01:18:56.165 --> 01:18:57.832
tomorrow morning okay,
we've got another proposal

01:18:57.834 --> 01:18:59.567
with Nisley at noon.

01:19:00.603 --> 01:19:03.104
This here, is a VeroTech man.

01:19:06.209 --> 01:19:09.777
- No, I, I don't think
I'll be doing that.

01:19:10.880 --> 01:19:11.880
Why?

01:19:13.583 --> 01:19:15.616
I don't think I'll
be doing that, Steve.

01:19:17.553 --> 01:19:19.036
- Ow.

01:19:19.037 --> 01:19:20.520
Okay, but you're
gonna get in trouble.

01:19:20.523 --> 01:19:23.057
He's in trouble, yeah,
he'll be in trouble.

01:19:23.059 --> 01:19:26.627
Speaking of trouble,
la la la la la la la.

01:19:27.563 --> 01:19:30.064
(rock music)

01:19:43.780 --> 01:19:47.414
- So you're upset
because I didn't leave?

01:19:47.416 --> 01:19:49.583
- I'm upset because you
came here and made a scene.

01:19:49.585 --> 01:19:51.719
Why didn't you just go
- Do you know how much

01:19:51.721 --> 01:19:54.655
it costs to change a flight?

01:19:54.657 --> 01:19:57.158
- Where have you been?

01:19:57.160 --> 01:19:59.960
- I've been letting
you cool off.

01:20:01.164 --> 01:20:02.296
Who do you keep looking at?

01:20:02.298 --> 01:20:03.764
- David.

01:20:03.766 --> 01:20:06.167
- No, no, stop, stop,
don't say anything stupid.

01:20:06.169 --> 01:20:08.569
- Anything stupid?
- Look, it's always the same.

01:20:08.571 --> 01:20:11.238
- Why don't you just go
- You disappear,

01:20:11.240 --> 01:20:12.706
you're alone, and
then we're fine.

01:20:12.708 --> 01:20:13.741
- It's not the same.

01:20:13.743 --> 01:20:14.742
- Here's what's gonna happen.

01:20:14.744 --> 01:20:15.709
We're gonna get on this plane,

01:20:15.711 --> 01:20:16.944
we're gonna go home together,

01:20:16.946 --> 01:20:19.847
and it'll be like this
weekend never happened.

01:20:19.849 --> 01:20:22.316
(rock music)

01:20:29.559 --> 01:20:31.058
Who's that?

01:20:31.060 --> 01:20:32.760
- I don't know.

01:20:32.762 --> 01:20:34.929
Ow, let go of me, David.

01:20:34.931 --> 01:20:36.363
- Why are you talking
to me like this?

01:20:36.365 --> 01:20:38.132
- You're hurting me, David.
- You're hurting me.

01:20:38.134 --> 01:20:40.401
- Stop it!
- I said I'm sorry.

01:20:40.403 --> 01:20:43.437
- Just stop it, let go of me!

01:20:43.439 --> 01:20:44.672
(slamming against the bar)

01:20:44.674 --> 01:20:45.940
- Are you okay?

01:20:45.942 --> 01:20:48.776
- Yeah, yeah yeah,
I'm fine, I'm fine.

01:20:51.514 --> 01:20:52.514
