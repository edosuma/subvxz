00:17.517 --> 00:21.521
A teenage
girl falls six stories,
then walks away unscathed.

00:24.524 --> 00:27.527
A man bursts into flames
with no signs of burns.

00:31.031 --> 00:36.036
One thing's for sure:
It's getting weirder
out there every day.

00:36.071 --> 00:38.538
But the truth is spoken here.

01:09.569 --> 01:11.321
Help me.

01:11.356 --> 01:13.073
What?

03:30.510 --> 03:32.512
Smile, loser.

03:49.529 --> 03:51.531
No need to run anymore, emma.

03:52.031 --> 03:53.783
You're among friends.

03:53.818 --> 03:55.535
How do you know my name?

04:01.040 --> 04:02.507
Wait, what's going on?

04:02.542 --> 04:04.544
All your questions
will be answered.

04:04.579 --> 04:08.047
Right now, time to go.

04:28.568 --> 04:30.535
Check out these shots, adam.

04:30.570 --> 04:33.072
Terrific. Uplink
to sanctuary database.

04:33.107 --> 04:35.039
Shalimar, jesse, great work.

04:35.074 --> 04:37.076
Will somebody please tell me
who the hell you guys are and

04:37.111 --> 04:39.095
what this is all about.

04:39.130 --> 04:41.080
Sorry, emma. I'm adam.

04:41.581 --> 04:43.583
And this is mutant x.

05:53.820 --> 05:58.324
Emma, your assailants
were members of a
security wing of genome x,

05:58.359 --> 06:02.829
a biotech firm
which is actually a secret
branch of u. s. Intelligence.

06:02.864 --> 06:05.832
Now this is
a visual cloak and...

06:05.867 --> 06:09.335
please don't panic.

06:12.338 --> 06:13.805
I can't see.

06:13.840 --> 06:15.341
It's only temporary.

06:41.367 --> 06:43.369
So, why do
they care about me?

06:43.870 --> 06:45.837
It's your
tele-empathic gift.

06:45.872 --> 06:49.375
Your power to sense
the feelings of others and
to influence those feelings.

06:49.410 --> 06:51.878
I don't know what
you're talking about.

07:08.895 --> 07:10.862
Pretty cool, huh?

07:10.897 --> 07:12.899
Is that what i looked
like when i first saw it?

07:12.934 --> 07:14.901
No,
you just started crying.

07:14.936 --> 07:17.869
Kidding.

07:17.904 --> 07:22.158
Shalimar and jesse and you
are all children of genome x.

07:22.193 --> 07:26.054
Genome x conducted a secret
human genetics program which had

07:26.089 --> 07:29.916
the unforeseen consequences
of creating men and women with

07:29.951 --> 07:32.936
special abilities like
your tele-empathic power.

07:32.971 --> 07:35.887
I keep telling you:
I don't have any powers.

07:35.922 --> 07:38.925
Now, you're aware of these
odd stories that we've been

07:39.425 --> 07:40.892
hearing about recently.

07:40.927 --> 07:44.180
Curious events, inexplicable
mysteries, human oddities.

07:44.215 --> 07:47.433
Yeah, but i never believed
those stories were true.

07:47.934 --> 07:50.937
Yes, alright, some of
them are fake, some of them are

07:50.972 --> 07:53.940
hoaxes, but to an alarming
degree, it's the children of

07:53.975 --> 07:56.407
genome x that are
behind such phenomena.

07:56.442 --> 07:59.445
So, it's not all aliens and
crystals and re-incarnation,

07:59.480 --> 08:00.411
huh?

08:00.446 --> 08:02.448
Yeah, well of course not,
you've seen what jesse and

08:02.483 --> 08:03.915
shalimar can do.

08:03.950 --> 08:06.452
There are perhaps a thousand
children of genome x. Now, some

08:06.487 --> 08:09.723
of them know who and what
they are, but some of them are

08:09.758 --> 08:12.959
terrified at the changes
that are happening to them.

08:12.994 --> 08:15.962
Well, i still don't
get why you kidnapped me.

08:15.997 --> 08:18.965
Well, i prefer
to call it recruitment.

08:23.469 --> 08:26.437
So, are you one
of these children too?

08:26.472 --> 08:31.477
No, i was chief
bio-geneticist at genome x.

08:43.489 --> 08:45.992
There were two
men and one woman.

08:46.492 --> 08:48.960
The woman,
she attacked like a tiger.

08:48.995 --> 08:51.497
One of the men seemed to be
able to go from intangible to

08:51.532 --> 08:53.965
massive at will.

08:54.000 --> 08:57.003
And the second man grabbed
the girl before we were able to

08:57.038 --> 08:59.470
get to her.

08:59.505 --> 09:02.008
That sounds like
adam and his people.

09:02.508 --> 09:06.477
Our gs agents
are new at this.

09:06.512 --> 09:15.021
Well, they have to get better
- and fast, mr. Thorne.

09:15.056 --> 09:17.023
Yes, mr. Eckhart.

09:17.058 --> 09:19.025
Yeah.

09:25.531 --> 09:29.035
Ah, good to go, huh?

09:37.543 --> 09:40.546
Despite
your genetically enhanced
abilities, the children of

09:40.581 --> 09:42.513
genome x are not super-human.

09:42.548 --> 09:44.515
I keep telling you,
i don't have any...

09:44.550 --> 09:46.552
it's widely
important for you to
recognize the toll that

09:47.053 --> 09:49.555
these abilities take
on your body, mind and soul.

09:49.590 --> 09:50.756
Soul?

09:51.257 --> 09:52.723
Soul.

09:52.758 --> 09:55.226
There's a spiritual
side to your condition too.

09:55.261 --> 09:58.764
Many of the
new mutants are under the
delusion that they're god.

10:05.271 --> 10:08.524
Now, i've designed this vdd
to diagnostically calibrate your

10:08.559 --> 10:12.170
genetic enhancement and to
identify any adjustment to your

10:12.205 --> 10:15.781
dna that might be required,
since your new mutant dna,

10:15.816 --> 10:18.784
it's in a constant
state of evolution.

10:23.289 --> 10:25.291
Well, that was too weird.

10:25.326 --> 10:27.293
Kind of like him myself.

10:27.328 --> 10:28.759
Yeah, me too.

10:28.794 --> 10:30.796
Helps me get in
touch with my powers.

10:30.831 --> 10:32.298
Well, i don't
have any powers.

10:32.798 --> 10:35.301
And i'm certainly
not a freak like you two.

10:35.801 --> 10:37.303
Freak?

10:52.318 --> 10:54.785
Jesse is very sensitive.

10:54.820 --> 10:57.823
Shalimar is very territorial
and very protective of the

10:57.858 --> 10:59.825
people she loves.

11:00.326 --> 11:02.328
And that includes jesse.

11:11.337 --> 11:12.803
Call me paranoid.

11:12.838 --> 11:15.841
But i figure the paranoid
will inherit the earth.

11:19.345 --> 11:21.812
I thought you'd
outgrown cartoons.

11:21.847 --> 11:23.349
I'm just curious about all
the stuff that's been going on

11:23.849 --> 11:24.850
ah, it's crap.

11:25.351 --> 11:27.318
And the interactive
hotline's got to be a scam.

11:27.353 --> 11:29.855
When you two are finished,
can we talk about how we're

11:29.890 --> 11:31.357
stepping up to
the big leagues tomorrow.

11:31.392 --> 11:33.359
The deal with carter's a go.

11:46.872 --> 11:50.376
I heard about all that
business last night, mason.

11:50.411 --> 11:53.379
Sounds like adam to me.

11:53.879 --> 11:56.347
You seem almost amused.

11:56.382 --> 12:00.886
That you don't despise
him for betraying you remains a

12:00.921 --> 12:02.888
mystery to me.

12:03.389 --> 12:06.392
That you hold him responsible
for the collapse of your

12:06.892 --> 12:10.396
immune system would have
nothing to do with that, eh?

12:10.431 --> 12:12.665
You were always
too hard on adam.

12:12.700 --> 12:15.051
And you were always
too easy, paul.

12:15.086 --> 12:17.495
And that's how
he stole your database.

12:17.530 --> 12:19.870
Which i have
nearly reconstructed.

12:19.905 --> 12:24.410
So we can make
amends for the horrific
mistakes we've made.

12:40.926 --> 12:43.429
I should have killed adam
when i had the chance.

12:43.929 --> 12:46.932
And now breedlove
intends to go to the press
and expose everything.

12:47.433 --> 12:50.936
And i'll never get the chance
to bring adam to the justice

12:50.971 --> 12:52.938
that he deserves.

12:53.439 --> 12:55.941
Well,
we can change all of that.

13:00.446 --> 13:02.413
What are we supposed to do?

13:02.448 --> 13:05.951
Well, i can't coerce her into
admitting she's a new mutant.

13:05.986 --> 13:09.722
Fine, i guess we've done
everything we can, then.

13:09.757 --> 13:13.459
Maybe the next step is to
get her out of town

13:13.959 --> 13:16.462
- under eckhart's radar.

13:16.962 --> 13:19.465
I'll get
jesse started then.

13:19.500 --> 13:21.467
Good.

14:48.787 --> 14:52.290
Normal people don't want
super-powered freaks next door.

14:52.325 --> 14:55.794
I don't think they'll be
too thrilled about having new

14:55.829 --> 14:57.761
mutants as covert ops either.

14:57.796 --> 14:59.298
Well, we put them
in the field as agents,

14:59.333 --> 15:00.799
no one
will know about it.

15:04.303 --> 15:08.307
Sorry to barge in like this,
paul, but i wanted mr. Thorne

15:08.342 --> 15:11.310
to have a look at security
so he'd be able to be

15:11.810 --> 15:14.813
ready for you
when you go public.

15:14.848 --> 15:17.281
That's a wonderful idea.

15:17.316 --> 15:21.320
Since i'm going to the press
next week with full disclosure

15:21.820 --> 15:24.323
of what's been
happening here since the
inception of this program.

15:24.358 --> 15:26.825
At least call me first.

15:27.326 --> 15:31.330
Have to approach
this with finesse.

15:36.835 --> 15:38.337
I'll give
you a heads-up.

15:38.837 --> 15:40.339
Thanks, paul.

15:44.843 --> 15:47.346
You should come down
and visit us more often.

15:58.857 --> 16:00.859
A week doesn't
give you much time.

16:27.186 --> 16:29.688
Wooh.

16:30.689 --> 16:32.656
So i got here a little early.

16:32.691 --> 16:35.694
Thought i'd take her
out for a little test drive.

16:35.729 --> 16:36.695
What?

16:37.196 --> 16:38.662
You took it for a spin?

16:38.697 --> 16:41.200
You got any idea what we could
get for this at a chop shop?

16:41.235 --> 16:43.667
What do you mean "we"?

16:43.702 --> 16:46.205
Unlike you, i set
higher goals for myself
than grand theft auto.

16:46.240 --> 16:49.208
Right on time, i see.

16:49.708 --> 16:54.713
Mr. Carter,
you remember brennan and tony.

16:54.748 --> 16:57.216
It's a beauty.

16:57.716 --> 16:59.218
I bet it takes the
curves at 120, huh?

16:59.718 --> 17:02.721
I meant the hickman and
wrightson securities building.

17:03.222 --> 17:07.226
Now, you understand that you
have only a hundred and twenty

17:07.726 --> 17:09.693
seconds once the alarm
is cut to get in and get out.

17:09.728 --> 17:12.231
When you picked
my pocket this morning,
you got your hands on this.

17:12.731 --> 17:14.698
The vice-president has the twin.

17:14.733 --> 17:17.986
These two keys need to
be activated simultaneously.

17:18.021 --> 17:21.240
Not to worry, mr. Carter,
we won't let you down.

17:21.275 --> 17:22.741
Yeah, see that you don't.

17:23.242 --> 17:25.743
Because there's
always somebody that wants
your place on the food chain.

17:47.466 --> 17:49.433
You.

17:49.468 --> 17:51.470
You got stones of steel, dog.

17:51.970 --> 17:55.474
Taking a joyride
in the client's car.

17:55.509 --> 17:56.475
Nice.

17:56.975 --> 17:58.442
Yeah.

17:58.477 --> 18:01.980
So, now you see why
a chop shop isn't an option.

18:03.482 --> 18:04.483
What's up?

18:04.983 --> 18:05.949
I don't know.

18:05.984 --> 18:07.486
I've been
hanging around.

18:13.492 --> 18:15.459
This way.

18:15.494 --> 18:17.961
Well,
i'll say one thing.

18:17.996 --> 18:20.499
This must be one
hell of a book store.

18:20.534 --> 18:22.000
You have no idea.

18:37.516 --> 18:39.483
Adam...

18:39.518 --> 18:41.770
and a pretty girl.

18:41.805 --> 18:44.022
It's almost ready.

18:44.057 --> 18:45.023
Good.

18:45.524 --> 18:46.990
Emma, say hello to ruby.

18:47.025 --> 18:53.532
Yes, the place is a mess,
but i am spotless... trust me.

18:53.567 --> 18:56.535
Your mind, it's
an open book to me.

18:56.570 --> 19:00.038
Ruby's a telepath.

19:00.539 --> 19:02.541
I prefer esper,
it just sounds...

19:03.041 --> 19:05.043
sexier.

19:08.547 --> 19:12.050
Oh adam, you told
me she was special.

19:12.085 --> 19:15.053
You didn't tell me how special.

19:18.056 --> 19:19.558
Well, come on, let's go.

19:38.076 --> 19:41.079
Just like in the movies.

19:45.584 --> 19:47.586
Allison, vince,
this is emma.

19:47.621 --> 19:48.587
What's up, adam.

19:48.622 --> 19:50.088
Adam.

20:08.106 --> 20:09.858
Hey, girl, what's up.

20:09.893 --> 20:11.575
What is this place?

20:11.610 --> 20:13.111
This is a new
mutant safe house.

20:13.146 --> 20:15.078
Safe from what?

20:15.113 --> 20:17.616
Your assailants last night, they
were the tip of the iceberg.

20:17.651 --> 20:20.136
So, what's your power?

20:20.171 --> 20:22.397
I don't have any powers.

20:22.432 --> 20:24.588
Ah, power of denial.

20:24.623 --> 20:26.875
So, you ready to leave tomorrow?

20:26.910 --> 20:29.127
We're going to
get you out of town.

20:29.628 --> 20:32.130
We're going to give you a
new identity, a whole new life.

20:32.165 --> 20:34.097
Well, what if
i don't want to go?

20:34.132 --> 20:38.637
Well,
the people we rescued you
from last night will try again.

20:38.672 --> 20:41.640
And they're nowhere
near as friendly as we are.

20:41.675 --> 20:44.142
Why don't you show her around.

20:44.643 --> 20:46.144
Yeah.

20:51.650 --> 20:53.151
It's too bad about emma, huh?

20:53.652 --> 20:54.618
Yeah, no kidding.

20:54.653 --> 20:56.154
Adam had a lot
of hopes for her.

20:56.189 --> 20:58.156
Now it's
still just us.

20:58.657 --> 21:00.659
Well,
we've both seen that
kind of denial before.

21:05.163 --> 21:06.164
You okay?

21:06.665 --> 21:08.632
Fine, why?

21:08.667 --> 21:13.672
Well, she was pretty
nasty to both of us.

21:14.172 --> 21:17.641
Yeah, she was also
scared out of her wits.

21:17.676 --> 21:21.179
Still, it would
have been nice to have
another woman on the team.

21:21.680 --> 21:23.682
I'm with you on that one.

21:24.182 --> 21:26.685
I thought she would
have made a good fit.

21:30.689 --> 21:34.192
"When genome x was conceived,
we saw ourselves as pioneers

21:34.227 --> 21:37.696
in a new frontier of knowledge.

21:43.702 --> 21:48.206
Men and women with the
power to remake the world.

21:48.241 --> 21:52.210
The power to play
god with the genetic code.

21:56.715 --> 22:04.222
All of us at genome x feel
enormous guilt for the harm we

22:04.257 --> 22:11.730
have caused in manipulating
dna against the laws of nature. "

22:13.231 --> 22:16.199
Speak for yourself, paul.

22:16.234 --> 22:18.737
And what's that
supposed to mean?

22:18.772 --> 22:21.204
I don't
share your guilt.

22:21.239 --> 22:26.745
"The government owes enormous
reparations to the victims of

22:26.780 --> 22:32.215
genome x for the horror
inflicted on these innocents. "

22:32.250 --> 22:39.257
Can't put the demons
back in the box after
they've been released.

22:39.292 --> 22:43.261
There's no need for them to
suffer without compensation.

22:43.296 --> 22:45.729
The only thing this
compensates is your guilt.

22:45.764 --> 22:48.767
You create these anomalies
and then make it better by

22:49.267 --> 22:53.236
apologizing, and let someone
else clean up after you.

22:53.271 --> 22:56.775
Perhaps if you recognized adam
for the criminal that he is,

22:57.275 --> 23:00.779
you wouldn't
be so self- deluded.

23:01.279 --> 23:03.281
Mr. Thorne.

23:17.796 --> 23:20.298
Before you went off the deep
end you should have consulted

23:20.333 --> 23:22.801
with one of
your innocent victims.

23:22.836 --> 23:24.267
What?

23:24.302 --> 23:25.303
That's right.

23:25.804 --> 23:27.771
Don't have to
apologize to me, dr. Breedlove,

23:27.806 --> 23:30.558
because i'm a child of
genome x and, quite frankly,

23:30.593 --> 23:33.311
i wouldn't have got this
job if i wasn't so special.

23:33.346 --> 23:35.080
If only you'd
kept your mouth shut,

23:35.115 --> 23:36.815
everything would have been fine.

23:37.315 --> 23:39.317
But you had to
beat yourself up with guilt
over the mess you've made.

23:39.352 --> 23:43.822
And now i have to use
your lemons to make lemonade.

24:25.363 --> 24:32.120
It was nice of him to rebuild
the database before he died.

24:32.155 --> 24:38.877
It will make tracking these
anomalies that much easier.

24:45.884 --> 24:48.386
So much for the paper trail.

27:12.897 --> 27:15.900
Your new identity.

27:16.401 --> 27:18.403
Everything you need.

27:22.907 --> 27:24.909
Hey.

27:25.410 --> 27:27.912
Tell jesse i'm sorry
for that "freak" crack.

27:27.947 --> 27:30.880
I didn't mean it.

27:30.915 --> 27:32.917
It's already forgotten.

27:39.924 --> 27:42.427
I got to tell you,
girl, i understand your
decision completely.

27:42.927 --> 27:45.395
What decision?

27:45.430 --> 27:47.932
Not to join mutant x. I
mean, it's not like every new

27:47.967 --> 27:50.435
mutant's a hero.

28:00.945 --> 28:02.912
Did everything go as planned?

28:02.947 --> 28:05.450
Five hundred
treasury certificates,
each worth ten grand.

28:05.485 --> 28:07.417
For a total of ten mil'.

28:07.452 --> 28:09.419
Oh, well, actually
that's twenty million.

28:09.454 --> 28:11.956
Since the certificates belonged
to you already, that's ten

28:11.991 --> 28:14.959
million and another ten
from the insurance company.

28:14.994 --> 28:16.426
Smart boy.

28:16.461 --> 28:18.212
A thief who knows
his investments.

28:18.247 --> 28:19.929
I'd keep an eye on
him if i were you.

28:19.964 --> 28:22.967
What, he pays us chump change
and doubles his ten mil'?

28:23.002 --> 28:25.470
That's the nature
of the business.

28:42.487 --> 28:43.453
Hotline.

28:43.488 --> 28:43.988
Can i help you?

28:44.489 --> 28:45.455
Yeah.

28:45.490 --> 28:46.991
Is it true you're
offering money for stories.

28:47.026 --> 28:49.261
If they're interesting.

28:49.296 --> 28:51.461
Do i have a freak for you.

28:51.496 --> 28:54.999
This guy named mulwray, brennan
mulwray, shoots lightning

28:55.034 --> 28:56.966
from his hands.

28:57.001 --> 28:59.003
And he's a thief too.

29:01.506 --> 29:03.473
With dr. Breedlove's death,

29:03.508 --> 29:06.511
i have set
in motion several sweeping
changes in our operation.

29:07.011 --> 29:11.015
Starting with an
expanded budget that will
affect all departments.

29:11.050 --> 29:15.019
We have operated under
covert conditions since

29:15.054 --> 29:17.487
the inception of this project.

29:17.522 --> 29:21.526
That need for
secrecy has been brought
home by this brutal murder.

29:22.026 --> 29:26.530
A heinous crime that was
committed by a product of the

29:26.565 --> 29:31.035
program, who somehow managed
to break into our archives

29:31.536 --> 29:36.791
section and burn
that historical landmark to
the ground in the process.

29:36.826 --> 29:42.046
Genome x will
not be cowed, corrupted or
co-opted by these creatures.

29:42.081 --> 29:46.050
Instead, i have been mandated
to create the genetic security

29:46.085 --> 29:51.072
agency to protect the world
from this rapacious menace.

29:51.107 --> 29:56.025
While our
pure research continues,
this covert force will

29:56.060 --> 30:01.030
take these anomalies
into custody under a
cloak of absolute secrecy.

30:01.065 --> 30:06.070
I know i can count
on you all to do your best
in this time of transition.

30:06.105 --> 30:09.073
Thank you.

30:18.082 --> 30:20.084
That went well, don't you think?

30:20.119 --> 30:22.587
Well, they seemed happy.

30:23.087 --> 30:27.056
Don't get carried
away, mr. Thorne.

30:27.091 --> 30:33.097
They're all just
easily bought by flattery
and bigger paycheques.

30:33.132 --> 30:35.367
Status?

30:35.402 --> 30:37.567
Oh.

30:37.602 --> 30:40.104
We have a lead on the electrical
anomaly from our taps on

30:40.139 --> 30:43.107
the proxy blue hotline.

30:43.142 --> 30:45.109
May i?

30:46.611 --> 30:48.613
Do i have a freak for you.

30:49.113 --> 30:51.616
This guy named mulwray, brennan
mulwray, shoots lightning

30:51.651 --> 30:54.083
from his hands.

30:54.118 --> 30:56.621
And he's a thief too.

30:56.656 --> 30:58.890
Nicely done.

30:58.925 --> 31:01.090
Thank you.

31:01.125 --> 31:05.630
Well, let's start performing
the job that we were born to

31:05.665 --> 31:07.632
do, shall we?

31:07.667 --> 31:09.634
Indeed.

32:00.785 --> 32:02.787
So how well did you
know this breedlove?

32:03.288 --> 32:05.255
He was my mentor.

32:05.290 --> 32:11.796
He was the guy who started
genome x. Now, with his death,

32:11.831 --> 32:15.800
everything i feared
has come to pass.

32:24.309 --> 32:26.811
Okay, the hydrofoil
leaves in fifteen minutes.

32:26.846 --> 32:28.813
Let's go.

32:30.815 --> 32:32.317
What?

32:33.318 --> 32:33.818
Oh my god.

32:34.319 --> 32:35.285
What?

32:35.320 --> 32:36.321
It's them.

32:36.356 --> 32:39.324
Them?

32:44.829 --> 32:47.332
The guys that were after me.

32:56.841 --> 32:58.343
Dammit.

33:03.348 --> 33:04.849
Adam?

33:04.884 --> 33:06.351
Adam?

33:06.851 --> 33:07.817
I am so sorry.

33:07.852 --> 33:09.854
Look, emma used
her powers to ditch me.

33:09.889 --> 33:11.321
I'll check in later.

33:11.356 --> 33:14.359
Well, so much for denial.

33:14.394 --> 33:15.860
We got to find her.

33:15.895 --> 33:16.861
Yeah.

33:17.362 --> 33:19.329
Can't let someone with her
ability to manipulate the

33:19.364 --> 33:21.866
feelings of others become
the tool of our worst nightmare.

33:21.901 --> 33:25.370
You know what to do.

33:39.884 --> 33:40.850
Bingo.

33:40.885 --> 33:42.387
Adam, i've accessed
the satellite data feed.

33:42.422 --> 33:43.388
Thanks, jesse.

33:43.888 --> 33:45.390
Now all we have to
do is find allison's car.

33:46.891 --> 33:48.393
On the trail, adam.

33:53.898 --> 33:55.900
This seat taken?

33:55.935 --> 33:57.669
Hey, no.

33:57.704 --> 33:59.369
Have a seat.

33:59.404 --> 34:01.406
I was kind of
hoping to see you again.

34:10.415 --> 34:13.418
Actually, i saw into
you the other night.

34:13.453 --> 34:14.918
How did you do that?

34:14.954 --> 34:17.387
It's a gift.

34:17.422 --> 34:21.426
I thought
i could sense something
special about you too.

34:21.460 --> 34:23.393
Oh yeah?

34:23.428 --> 34:26.396
Yeah, but it's...

34:26.431 --> 34:28.898
it's not a mind thing.

34:28.933 --> 34:30.935
You see,
i found out i could throw
off sparks when a kid.

34:30.969 --> 34:32.902
You know, being that...

34:32.937 --> 34:36.940
that different was just
asking for a world of hurt.

34:36.976 --> 34:39.210
So i always
felt like a freak.

34:39.246 --> 34:41.411
No one ever
saw you do it?

34:41.446 --> 34:43.447
No, like i said,
i keep it to myself.

34:43.947 --> 34:45.915
Same with me.

34:45.949 --> 34:48.953
One day i'm salesgirl of the
month at leverman and stokes

34:48.987 --> 34:51.420
and...

34:51.456 --> 34:53.458
you'd be surprised
how persuasive i
can be when it comes to

34:53.493 --> 34:55.425
misses and petites.

34:55.460 --> 34:57.927
No, i don't think
i'd be surprised at all.

34:57.962 --> 35:01.215
Next day,
i'm trapped in somebody
else's paranoid fantasy.

35:01.250 --> 35:04.469
No one wants to be friends with
someone who knows how you're

35:04.504 --> 35:08.240
feeling and can make
you feel any way you choose.

35:08.275 --> 35:11.976
But i used to love to
get dates to jump through hoops

35:12.011 --> 35:13.745
saturday night.

35:13.780 --> 35:15.445
Yeah, i'll bet.

35:15.480 --> 35:17.982
Oh, now you just use
your powers for good?

35:18.483 --> 35:19.984
I don't think
i'd call them powers.

35:20.485 --> 35:21.986
Comes and goes, and when
they're here i don't have a real

35:22.487 --> 35:24.238
good handle on them.

35:24.273 --> 35:25.990
You know what i mean?

35:32.497 --> 35:34.999
Here, touch my hand.

35:36.501 --> 35:38.002
Touch my hand.

35:42.507 --> 35:44.974
Nice.

35:45.009 --> 35:47.477
There's this guy, adam.

35:47.512 --> 35:50.515
He thinks i can
learn to control my powers
with a little training.

35:50.550 --> 35:53.518
Now he's going
to be pissed at me.

35:53.553 --> 35:55.520
He wanted
me to join him.

35:55.555 --> 35:58.022
I just got scared.

36:04.028 --> 36:06.030
Woah, woah,
wait, wait, wait.

36:06.065 --> 36:08.032
You're not
leaving, are you?

36:08.067 --> 36:10.034
The ladies room.

36:18.543 --> 36:21.511
Sensational.

36:21.546 --> 36:23.548
Mind if i join you, mr mulwray?

36:27.051 --> 36:28.017
I've got it, adam.

36:28.052 --> 36:30.054
Halfway down the
500 block on darien street.

36:32.056 --> 36:33.558
I'm on my way.

36:48.839 --> 36:50.841
I tracked the car.

36:50.876 --> 36:52.808
What can i do for you.

36:52.843 --> 36:55.311
The question is:
What can i do for you?

36:55.346 --> 36:57.348
I came here to make
you the deal of a lifetime.

36:57.383 --> 36:58.849
Fast cars.

36:59.350 --> 37:00.816
Hot women.

37:00.851 --> 37:03.854
All the money you'll ever need.

37:03.889 --> 37:06.322
See, the...

37:06.357 --> 37:10.361
the opportunities for a man of
your talent, they're limitless.

37:10.396 --> 37:11.862
Talents?

37:18.369 --> 37:19.835
Don't be coy.

37:19.870 --> 37:21.372
I've been watching
you for a long time.

37:21.407 --> 37:22.873
Really?

37:36.887 --> 37:38.354
Huh?

37:38.389 --> 37:40.356
You know, as...

37:40.391 --> 37:44.395
as tempting as that
may sound, i think i'll pass.

37:44.430 --> 37:46.397
I wouldn't do
that if i were you.

37:59.910 --> 38:01.412
She's headed
for the skycourse.

38:01.447 --> 38:02.913
She's not alone.

38:03.914 --> 38:05.416
I'm on my way.

38:49.460 --> 38:51.462
You got him.

38:52.963 --> 38:54.465
Never used it
against a person before.

38:54.500 --> 38:55.984
Is he dead?

38:56.019 --> 38:57.468
I don't know.

39:06.977 --> 39:08.979
Did you really
think we'd come after
a guy like you without

39:09.014 --> 39:10.981
being prepared?

39:14.985 --> 39:15.986
This is not good.

39:16.487 --> 39:17.953
No, it's not, is it?

39:17.988 --> 39:19.990
We know your m. o., mr. Mulwray.

39:25.496 --> 39:28.464
Ah, do you really
want to do that?

39:28.499 --> 39:31.502
Piss us off, because we're going
to beat you senseless anyway.

39:39.009 --> 39:40.511
You know, anytime you want
to make these guys jump through

39:41.011 --> 39:42.012
hoops would be fine with me.

39:42.047 --> 39:43.013
I can't.

39:43.514 --> 39:44.515
I lose it when
i'm stressed.

39:44.550 --> 39:45.981
Great.

39:46.016 --> 39:47.017
Yeah, it's great.

39:47.518 --> 39:49.520
It's going to make mr eckhart
very happy to take you alive.

41:21.111 --> 41:22.613
Brennan!

41:35.125 --> 41:37.628
Stop.

41:38.629 --> 41:40.596
Let them go.

41:40.631 --> 41:42.633
This isn't over yet.

41:50.140 --> 41:52.142
Adam.

41:52.643 --> 41:54.109
I'm so sorry.

41:54.144 --> 41:57.112
I didn't mean to
cause all this trouble.

41:57.147 --> 42:00.150
And now you understand
the danger we're all in.
