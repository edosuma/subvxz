WEBVTT

00:02.127 --> 00:04.587
...some weird stuff started happening.

00:04.607 --> 00:06.450
Why does my stomach hurt?

00:06.477 --> 00:09.640
I'm sorry, baby.
I ate a bunch of ice cream earlier today.

00:09.647 --> 00:12.640
Oh, baby, you know
we're lactose-intolerant.

00:12.647 --> 00:14.277
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

00:14.411 --> 00:17.171
Are you suggesting that
when one of you feels something,

00:17.177 --> 00:21.429
- the other feels it, too?
- Oh, God, you guys are so codependent.

00:21.447 --> 00:23.677
- No, we're not.
- Oh, really?

00:23.777 --> 00:25.048
What about the other day?

00:25.485 --> 00:28.580
- Oh, I need to get some eggs.
- Oh, I'll come with you.

00:36.904 --> 00:40.471
Just because we like spending time
together doesn't mean we're codependent.

00:40.493 --> 00:41.678
Really?

00:41.681 --> 00:44.479
Then whatever happened to your plan
of spending the last two weeks

00:44.479 --> 00:46.591
before your wedding sleeping apart?

00:46.678 --> 00:51.301
Okay, we decided not
to do that because of...

00:51.336 --> 00:52.631
Logistics.

00:52.646 --> 00:54.681
- Wedding logistics.
- Frickin' logistics, man.

00:54.708 --> 00:56.121
They mess everything up.

00:56.136 --> 00:58.582
You didn't do it
because you couldn't do it.

00:58.598 --> 01:00.363
- Sure we could.
- Then why don't you?

01:00.375 --> 01:01.701
You can stay with me.

01:04.315 --> 01:07.291
It would make our wedding
night more special.

01:08.168 --> 01:10.561
- Okay, let's do it.
- Done.

01:10.576 --> 01:13.560
- I'm gonna go grab a beer.
- I'll come with you.

01:15.306 --> 01:18.251
No. I'll stay.

www.forom.com

01:34.115 --> 01:36.920
Okay, I know.
You know? I got to go.

01:36.936 --> 01:38.281
Good-bye.

01:38.306 --> 01:40.420
My mom's driving me cra....

01:40.507 --> 01:42.163
God, you guys are covered in sauce.

01:42.175 --> 01:43.641
We'll get to that.
Me first.

01:43.658 --> 01:46.681
My mom is driving me crazy
about the wedding music.

01:46.706 --> 01:49.883
The woman takes one cruise
to Jamaica, and suddenly, it's

01:49.896 --> 01:52.412
"not a party without steel drums."

01:52.425 --> 01:54.643
Doesn't everybody know
you're not supposed to stress out

01:54.658 --> 01:56.550
a bride right before her wedding?!

01:57.577 --> 01:59.540
Okay, sauce, go.

01:59.926 --> 02:02.360
- Long story. I'll tell you later.
- Yeah.

02:02.375 --> 02:04.170
It's a dirty story, isn't it?

02:04.198 --> 02:07.673
You guys went out to dinner,
did it in the kitchen and got caught.

02:07.696 --> 02:11.090
Scherbatsky reeks of
someone who likes to get caught.

02:11.407 --> 02:13.902
Okay, now I have to wash up
for two reasons.

02:16.096 --> 02:18.422
Oh, you didn't.
That's right.

02:19.676 --> 02:23.232
So you and Lily really think
you can spend two weeks apart?

02:23.247 --> 02:24.193
You know what, Barney?

02:24.207 --> 02:27.141
Lily and I are a lot less chees
than you make us out to be.

02:27.158 --> 02:30.442
Marshmallow, don't forget
to pack my night-night tape.

02:31.236 --> 02:32.970
Night-night tape?

02:33.297 --> 02:37.623
Did you make a tape of
you saying "night-night" to her?

02:37.646 --> 02:40.740
- No.
- He doesn't say it. He sings it.

02:41.255 --> 02:43.370
Oh, that is so sweet.

02:43.385 --> 02:46.960
Why don't you kiss?
I love it when two chicks make out.

02:47.506 --> 02:48.490
Damn it.

02:48.508 --> 02:51.321
Nobody's bought us anything cool yet off our registry.

02:51.336 --> 02:53.631
- What's on there?
- Ooh, lots of stuff.

02:53.647 --> 02:57.200
Kitchen Aide Artisan Series
tilt-head stand mixer...

02:57.216 --> 03:00.660
Retail price $319.99.
What else?

03:01.328 --> 03:05.270
Um, the Dyson DC17 Animal vacuum.

03:05.288 --> 03:09.851
Ah, $549.99.
A little greedy, don't you think?

03:10.606 --> 03:14.411
- Did you memorize our registry?
- No, I'm training.

03:14.466 --> 03:17.742
- Training? For what?
- I'm glad you asked.

03:17.855 --> 03:19.352
Ted, Robin, get in here!

03:19.727 --> 03:24.003
You guys know how it's hard to be
friends with me 'cause I'm so awesome?

03:24.015 --> 03:27.132
Yes, it's hard to be friends with you.
Go on.

03:27.537 --> 03:29.802
Well, this isn't going
to make it any easier.

03:29.818 --> 03:34.440
I am going to be on...
The Price Is Right.

03:34.458 --> 03:35.912
- No way!
- What?!

03:35.915 --> 03:39.002
Yes, in a couple days, Rich Fields
is going to call out my name,

03:39.015 --> 03:43.203
- and I will come on down.
- Whoa, that is so awesome.

03:43.216 --> 03:45.862
Barney, I didn't know you were
such a fan of The Price is Right.

03:45.876 --> 03:47.583
Are you kidding?

03:47.605 --> 03:52.521
T.P.I.R. is not just an indescribably
entertaining hour of television,

03:52.537 --> 03:56.043
it's a microcosm of
our entire economic system--

03:56.057 --> 04:01.072
a capitalist utopia, where consumers
are rewarded for their persistence,

04:01.137 --> 04:04.813
market acumen and intrepid spirit.

04:05.305 --> 04:08.802
I gaze upon the glory of The Price Is Right,

04:08.817 --> 04:12.052
and I see the face of America.

04:12.376 --> 04:14.940
And it is divine.

04:15.417 --> 04:18.290
Plus, you know,
hot chicks on sports cars.

04:19.887 --> 04:23.450
Then Lily headed out to Robin's
for her first night away from Marshall.

04:23.477 --> 04:29.591
- I'm ready!
- Ta-da-da-da-da...

04:31.576 --> 04:35.492
- Wow, Lily, you look so beautiful.
- I know! I'm beautiful!

04:36.435 --> 04:38.680
I'm a fairy princess!

04:39.987 --> 04:42.031
I'm too skinny for my dress!

04:43.127 --> 04:46.191
Meanwhile, I was testing out
my best man toast on Marshall.

04:46.377 --> 04:47.542
Here goes.

04:48.608 --> 04:51.803
Hello, everyone, I'm Ted Mosby,
Marshall's best man.

04:51.896 --> 04:53.362
Strong opening, right?
That's fantastic.

04:53.377 --> 04:56.263
When Marshall graduates
this spring, he'll be a lawyer.

04:56.277 --> 04:59.641
But did you know that
Marshall has a criminal record?

04:59.698 --> 05:02.621
That's right, on a road trip
up to Cape Cod,

05:02.635 --> 05:06.972
Marshall was pulled over for driving
by himself in a car pool lane.

05:07.857 --> 05:09.010
Oh, crap.

05:09.725 --> 05:11.030
Oh, crap.

05:11.786 --> 05:13.251
Are you crazy?

05:13.278 --> 05:16.571
You cannot tell that story
at my wedding.

05:16.586 --> 05:18.270
My entire family's gonna be there.

05:18.285 --> 05:22.512
My little cousins, my mom, my grandma,
my grandpa the minister.

05:22.578 --> 05:24.541
That grandpa died three years ago.

05:24.995 --> 05:27.490
His favorite grandson
is getting married, Ted.

05:27.505 --> 05:30.751
I think he can take a day off from
haunting the barn to make an appearance.

05:31.875 --> 05:32.850
Whoo!

05:33.555 --> 05:35.073
Whoo-whoo!

05:36.245 --> 05:37.301
Whoo!

05:37.488 --> 05:39.241
Whoo-hoo!

05:40.308 --> 05:41.783
Oh, yeah!
Oh, yeah!

05:43.305 --> 05:49.310
Oh, yeah! Oh, yeah!
Oh, yeah!

05:50.177 --> 05:52.691
- So which one, "A" or "B"?
- What was that?

05:52.857 --> 05:55.603
I have to decide how to run
to contestant's row when they say,

05:55.617 --> 05:57.623
"Barney Stinson, come on down!"

05:57.698 --> 06:00.311
Oh, I didn't realize that's what it was.
Can you do them again?

06:00.328 --> 06:01.883
Yeah, of course.

06:06.388 --> 06:09.131
Hey! Very funny.

06:09.677 --> 06:13.122
Just for that, when I win all the prizes,
the only thing you guys are getting

06:13.137 --> 06:15.681
is Rice-A-Roni and Turtle Wax.

06:17.048 --> 06:20.533
It's $300 just to take the bust in?

06:20.547 --> 06:23.593
Oh, please, you have to have
some sympathy for me.

06:23.608 --> 06:27.263
I'm getting married next Saturday,
and I'm too skinny for my dress.

06:27.275 --> 06:30.032
I lost all this weight
without even trying.

06:30.248 --> 06:31.221
Hello?

06:32.508 --> 06:35.580
- What happened?
- She called me a bitch and hung up.

06:35.695 --> 06:38.953
Oh, I don't know what to do.
I guess I'll just have to pay the $300.

06:38.975 --> 06:41.560
Pay the $300?
Lily, are you crazy?

06:41.578 --> 06:44.693
This isn't a problem.
It's a license to eat.

06:44.696 --> 06:49.100
Look, what have you always wanted to eat but
didn't because it was too ridicuusly decadent?

06:49.117 --> 06:53.833
Ooh, a Valrhona chocolate soufflÃ©
with a raspberry brandy sauce

06:53.847 --> 06:58.790
topped with caramelized bananas
and hazelnut gelato.

06:59.177 --> 07:01.313
I have Cool Whip and half a bag of Fritos.

07:01.325 --> 07:03.153
Done!

07:04.476 --> 07:07.490
Okay, think you're gonna be
happy with my new toast.

07:07.518 --> 07:08.941
There's nothing sexual.

07:08.957 --> 07:12.433
It's, uh, it's just the story of an
important moment in your relationship.

07:12.445 --> 07:13.481
I'm all ears.

07:13.496 --> 07:16.262
Hello, everyone, I'm Ted Mosby,
Marshall's best man.

07:16.277 --> 07:17.853
- Nice.
- Right? That's great.

07:17.865 --> 07:19.372
Back when we were all freshman

07:19.386 --> 07:22.443
and Marshall and Lily were just a few
short weeks into their relationship...

07:22.777 --> 07:27.392
It was 4:00 in the morning, and I'm not
gonna lie, we were a wee bit wasted.

07:27.978 --> 07:29.250
We were starving.

07:29.265 --> 07:33.052
So I'd gone out to get us some
snacks, and when I got back...

07:36.055 --> 07:40.210
- I love you.
- I love you, too.

07:40.304 --> 07:44.561
I know it's soon to say it,
but I'm so glad you did.

07:46.953 --> 07:48.328
Yeah.

07:49.741 --> 07:53.489
So here's what you want to talk
about in front of my entire family:

07:53.489 --> 07:57.141
drinking, having a girl in my room,
eating junk food.

07:57.158 --> 08:00.501
Dude, you're almost 30. Your mom would
be mad at you for eating junk food?

08:00.517 --> 08:03.912
Yeah, Ted, 'cause nutrition's
not important.

08:04.196 --> 08:06.521
Also, so Lily's never heard
that story before.

08:06.538 --> 08:09.712
How's she going to react when she finds out
the first time I said "I love you" to her,

08:09.726 --> 08:12.561
I was actually saying it to you
and a bag of Funyuns?

08:12.675 --> 08:15.510
But who cares? You did love her.
And you still do.

08:15.515 --> 08:18.390
And you're totally over Funyuns,
so it's not weird.

08:20.545 --> 08:22.361
- Hey, Lil.
- Hey.

08:22.727 --> 08:24.942
Hey? That's it?

08:25.828 --> 08:27.011
What are you talking about?

08:27.025 --> 08:29.032
Well, you guys have been spending
the last few nights apart.

08:29.045 --> 08:32.082
I figured there'd be a lot of giggling,
crying, jumping up and down,

08:32.097 --> 08:34.052
and then whatever Lily would do.

08:34.635 --> 08:37.562
Now, one thing I remember about
the bar menu at McClaren's

08:37.578 --> 08:41.232
is that there were no fewer than
11 different deep-fried appetizers.

08:41.565 --> 08:44.220
That night, Aunt Lily ordered them all.

08:46.815 --> 08:48.021
Check it out.

08:48.398 --> 08:51.603
Okay, imagine... imagine, if you will,

08:51.618 --> 08:56.512
that this is the $1 space
on The Price Is Right wheel.

08:56.537 --> 08:57.572

08:59.000 --> 09:05.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

09:06.168 --> 09:07.970
Oh, wow, that was pretty close.

09:07.977 --> 09:09.453
Close?

09:09.478 --> 09:13.133
Close?! It's called The Price Is Right,
not The Price Is Close!

09:13.145 --> 09:15.242
Oh, man, this is bad.

09:15.258 --> 09:17.693
If I don't win the spin-off, and I can't
get into the Showcase Showdown,

09:17.708 --> 09:19.720
everything's ruined!
It's all ruined!

09:19.726 --> 09:22.622
What is ruined?
Why, why is this such a big deal?

09:23.658 --> 09:27.630
Okay, guys... sit down,
I've got to tell you something.

09:30.206 --> 09:33.433
The reason I'm going on The Price Is Right

09:33.447 --> 09:37.750
is because I've decided that it's time
for me to meet my real father.

09:37.808 --> 09:39.801
- Your father?
- That's right.

09:41.826 --> 09:46.351
My father... is Bob Barker.

09:50.337 --> 09:53.040
- Your dad... is Bob Barker?
- That's right.

09:53.227 --> 09:55.620
The host of The Price Is Right,
Bob Barker?

09:55.638 --> 09:56.590
That's Pops.

09:56.877 --> 09:59.031
- Barney?
- Yes, Robin?

09:59.125 --> 10:01.992
Why in the world do you think
Bob Barker is your father?

10:02.027 --> 10:06.213
Uh, because my mother told me
he was, that's why.

10:06.648 --> 10:08.673
Mom, who's my dad?

10:08.775 --> 10:11.573
All the other kids at school
know who their dad is.

10:11.875 --> 10:14.772
- Who's mine?
- Oh, I don't know.

10:15.516 --> 10:16.913
That guy.

10:20.246 --> 10:22.891
Look, Dad, I got straight A's!

10:24.148 --> 10:27.640
Hey, Dad, guess who I'm going
as for Halloween?

10:28.506 --> 10:30.112
Want to play some catch, Pop?

10:34.085 --> 10:37.162
So now I'm gonna go to L.A.,
be on the show,

10:37.175 --> 10:38.731
win the Showcase Showdown,

10:38.745 --> 10:42.381
make him proud of me,
and then tell him who I am.

10:42.835 --> 10:47.181
You're gonna tell Bob Barker that
you're his son on national television?

10:47.275 --> 10:50.011
Why is this so hard for you
people to believe?

10:50.935 --> 10:52.251
Drop the popper!

10:52.535 --> 10:54.801
Lily has to gain five pounds
in a week and a half,

10:54.815 --> 10:57.080
and it is my job to help her get there.

10:57.165 --> 10:59.383
This is the best wedding diet ever.

11:00.257 --> 11:03.241
- I lost a pound.
- That is impossible.

11:03.258 --> 11:05.332
You ate McDonald's
every meal for three days.

11:05.347 --> 11:08.253
I knew that Super Size
Me guy was full of it.

11:08.515 --> 11:11.533
Well, it must be the wedding stress.
We just got to up the intake.

11:11.656 --> 11:14.772
Lily Aldrin, drop and give me
20 bites of fudge!

11:15.568 --> 11:16.552
Okay?

11:17.507 --> 11:19.441
Don't nibble at it.
Attack it!

11:20.076 --> 11:21.872
Come on, Lily.
You can do better than that!

11:21.876 --> 11:22.670
I can't.

11:22.675 --> 11:25.312
Well, eat faster, before
your body figures out it's full.

11:25.316 --> 11:28.512
I'm trying.
Oh, are you gonna cry?

11:28.676 --> 11:31.291
You gonna cry?
Skinny little baby's gonna cry?

11:31.306 --> 11:33.950
- Well, eat, damn it, eat!
- Okay!

11:38.538 --> 11:42.742
Hey, so I think I figured out how to do
your toast in a completely appropriate way.

11:42.758 --> 11:44.492
- Finally.
- Yeah.

11:45.558 --> 11:48.303
Good evening. I'm Ted Mosby,
Marshall's best man.

11:48.318 --> 11:49.361
- Still strong, right?
- Great, yeah.

11:49.376 --> 11:53.432
I'd like to share with you all a story
about the momentous evening last fall

11:53.447 --> 11:56.223
when Marshall and Lily got back together.

11:56.535 --> 11:59.943
Afterward, we stayed up
till 10:00 at night,

12:00.215 --> 12:04.760
- doing shots of chocolate milk.
- Man, I'm well nourished right now!

12:04.806 --> 12:07.280
Calcium promotes healthy teeth and bones.

12:07.326 --> 12:11.211
Thanks, Marshall, for teaching us
you don't need alcohol to have fun.

12:11.226 --> 12:15.412
Oh, don't thank me. Thank my parents
for teaching me good values.

12:15.858 --> 12:17.983
Now, I wasn't supposed
to hear this next part,

12:17.998 --> 12:21.210
but Marshall leaned over
to Lily and whispered.

12:21.235 --> 12:23.622
You know what I'd like
to do to you right now?

12:24.136 --> 12:26.643
I'd like to hold your hand.

12:27.426 --> 12:29.700
I'd like to hold your hand so hard

12:29.986 --> 12:33.103
that you're not able
to shake hands for a week.

12:33.606 --> 12:38.281
Are you just going to talk about holding
my hand or are you going to hold it?

12:40.455 --> 12:44.180
Then a little later, Robin caught them...

12:44.685 --> 12:46.991
Oh, um... ...holding hands.

12:48.157 --> 12:51.112
It was a lovely and responsible night.

12:52.038 --> 12:53.891
To Marshall and Lily.

12:55.666 --> 12:57.612
That's the worst toast
I've ever heard, dude.

12:57.625 --> 12:59.560
- It's totally boring.
- Exactly.

12:59.576 --> 13:02.820
It's impossible to write a good toast
with you censoring me, man.

13:02.837 --> 13:03.870
I give up.

13:03.888 --> 13:06.670
I'm just going to read that thing
about Jesus and the footprints.

13:06.905 --> 13:09.791
I give up, too.
I don't care if my dress doesn't fit.

13:09.826 --> 13:11.291
I can't eat anymore.

13:11.307 --> 13:13.921
I-I feel like my stomach's going to explode.

13:13.936 --> 13:15.492
I know.

13:16.047 --> 13:18.811
And so, Lily and I were
both about to give up,

13:19.066 --> 13:22.332
but as you can all see,
Lily does look beautiful in that dress,

13:22.535 --> 13:25.370
and here I am giving a toast.

13:26.426 --> 13:30.260
You know, all this time, I'd been
wracking my brain trying to

13:30.278 --> 13:33.930
pick out the perfect moment to capture
Lily and Marshall as a couple.

13:34.457 --> 13:36.592
But then I realized the perfect
moment wasn't

13:36.607 --> 13:39.743
some needle lost in the haystack
of their ten years together.

13:40.075 --> 13:44.500
The perfect Lily and Marshall
moment happened two nights ago.

13:49.366 --> 13:50.962
Marshall, what are you doing?

13:51.697 --> 13:53.130
Going to the bathroom.

13:53.345 --> 13:54.360
In the hall?

13:54.905 --> 13:56.330
Sleepwalking?

13:56.468 --> 13:57.801
You're wide awake.

13:58.177 --> 13:59.882
- Robbing us?
- Dude.

14:00.165 --> 14:04.580
Turns out, all week long he'd been
sneaking out to a hotel on 72nd,

14:04.898 --> 14:06.150
to meet Lily.

14:06.437 --> 14:10.320
- God, I missed you.
- I can't sleep without you.

14:11.177 --> 14:12.672
Hey, baby?

14:13.676 --> 14:17.223
- Would you be the big spoon for a while?
- Sure, baby.

14:21.988 --> 14:25.421
- How's the weight gaining going?
- Ugh, terribly.

14:25.528 --> 14:28.391
I'm too stressed out without you around.

14:29.646 --> 14:31.361
Well, I'm here now.

14:34.035 --> 14:37.161
And so Lily and Marshall failed in
their experiment with apartness,

14:37.385 --> 14:40.241
but they succeeded
in getting Lily into her dress.

14:41.505 --> 14:44.972
You know, there really are a million things
I could tell you about Lily and Marshall,

14:44.997 --> 14:48.430
but really, the only thing
you need to know is

14:48.446 --> 14:51.271
that ten years into their relationship,

14:51.655 --> 14:54.951
they still couldn't spend
a single night apart.

14:56.525 --> 14:58.542
May they never have to again.

14:59.077 --> 15:02.771
To Lily and Marshall.
To Lily and Marshall.

15:02.965 --> 15:06.971
Now, kids, the story of Lily and
Marshall's wedding is a good one.

15:07.218 --> 15:09.320
No matter how perfectly you plan your...

15:09.338 --> 15:11.282
You know, wait a second, guys.
I'll get to that.

15:11.295 --> 15:13.433
First, I've got to tell you
what happened with Barney.

15:13.487 --> 15:16.581
Rich, what is the name
of our next participant?

15:16.597 --> 15:20.212
- Bob, it's Barney Stinson!
- Come on down!

15:20.228 --> 15:22.703
You're the next contestant
on The Price Is Right.

15:22.737 --> 15:24.211
Nooo. Oh, my God!

15:24.226 --> 15:26.033
Working his way out.

15:26.045 --> 15:28.692
High-five here, high-five there.

15:28.708 --> 15:31.373
- A big old hug here.
- Oh, my God!

15:31.385 --> 15:33.783
Yeah, I know, the camera loves me.

15:34.008 --> 15:37.063
Welcome to contestant's row, Barney.
Nice suit.

15:37.077 --> 15:41.283
- Thanks, Da... Bob.
- Here is the next item up for bid!

15:42.005 --> 15:46.732
Bob, the stylish his-and-her watches
feature an 18k gold bezel and crown

15:46.745 --> 15:48.931
and stainless steel bands.

15:48.976 --> 15:51.563
And Barney, what do you bid on that?

15:51.575 --> 15:55.373
Um... Wrong.

15:55.708 --> 15:56.783
Wrong.

15:56.806 --> 15:57.790
Wrong.

15:57.808 --> 15:58.830
Wrong.

15:59.106 --> 16:04.180
Retail price is $1,349.99, so, since
you round off, I'll say $1,350, Bob.

16:04.208 --> 16:07.843
- $1,350 for Barney.
- So, was it $1,350?

16:08.015 --> 16:09.212
I don't know.

16:09.525 --> 16:11.723
- Was it?
- Oh, my God!

16:12.116 --> 16:13.820
Happy wedding.

16:14.576 --> 16:18.913
Barney, you won that camcorder
in just one second!

16:18.916 --> 16:22.450
That is impressive.
I mean impressive.

16:22.466 --> 16:23.662
Thank you, Bob.

16:23.675 --> 16:27.883
Now, to win the computer,
you're going to have to bid again,

16:27.896 --> 16:30.450
and again I will say higher or lower.

16:30.476 --> 16:33.830
And let's show the audience
the price of the computer,

16:33.847 --> 16:36.861
and audience, please,
do not try to help us.

16:36.878 --> 16:40.091
And the clock will start
with your first bid.

16:40.418 --> 16:42.653
- $1 billion.
- Lower.

16:42.735 --> 16:45.400
So, I brought some photos
that I thought you might like to see.

16:45.416 --> 16:47.890
- This is me on my first birthday.
- Yes, Barney.

16:47.905 --> 16:49.740
- This is...
- What are you doing?

16:49.757 --> 16:52.853
Uh, spending some quality
time with my dad.

16:53.928 --> 16:56.590
That's very nice, but look, the clock is moving.

16:56.605 --> 16:59.500
You have only about 16 seconds.
Keep bidding.

16:59.518 --> 17:01.031
- No, no, I want you to see this. This is great.
- Keep bidding.

17:01.046 --> 17:03.412
This is me at my graduation.
I know, the hair.

17:03.425 --> 17:05.290
That, no, that's nice.
That's nice.

17:05.295 --> 17:10.069
You have only five, four,
three, two, one...

17:10.105 --> 17:11.829
- $999.
- Nine...

17:12.224 --> 17:15.372
Barney, you got it exactly right!

17:15.798 --> 17:18.813
- Happy wedding again!
- Oh, my...

17:20.108 --> 17:22.941
I have to be honest, Bob. The big wheel
is the only weak part of my game.

17:22.955 --> 17:25.942
I'm sure you'll do just fine, son.

17:26.788 --> 17:28.082
Did you just...

17:30.408 --> 17:33.651
- I'm ready, Bob.
- Do it! Do it! Here we go!

17:34.065 --> 17:36.503
He's looking for the dollar.

17:36.666 --> 17:39.500
- It's going around, and around...
- Oh, no, you spun it too hard.

17:39.515 --> 17:41.122
No, he didn't spin it hard enough.

17:41.138 --> 17:42.900
Here it comes, Barney.

17:45.307 --> 17:48.033
You got it!
You won...

17:51.275 --> 17:55.471
But Barney...
Barney, you're not through.

17:55.786 --> 18:00.032
You've won $1,000.
You've won a place in the showcase.

18:00.206 --> 18:03.410
You are doing splendidly so far.

18:03.427 --> 18:05.733
Thank you, would you, would
you say you're proud of me?

18:05.746 --> 18:07.260
Sure.

18:09.428 --> 18:11.881
That was kind of a weird moment.

18:12.817 --> 18:15.551
Very well, Barney, you have seen
the first showcase.

18:15.565 --> 18:18.910
Do you want to bid on it
or do you want to pass it to Millie?

18:18.937 --> 18:22.472
Please, no car and an above-ground spa?
Pass.

18:22.776 --> 18:27.383
Millie, he has passed this showcase
to you. What do you bid on it?

18:27.456 --> 18:33.533
- $17,640.
- $17,640.

18:33.548 --> 18:37.761
Overbid!
Now, let's see Showcase #2.

18:38.106 --> 18:41.252
Barney, your showcase
begins with a mystery.

18:41.266 --> 18:42.921
Oh, I love this.

18:43.376 --> 18:45.493
I can't believe how excited I am right now.

18:46.977 --> 18:50.243
Barney, you have seen your showcase.
What do you bid on it?

18:51.265 --> 18:53.000
Please, please.

18:53.468 --> 18:54.861
Please.

18:55.235 --> 18:56.482
Let me.

19:01.257 --> 19:05.443
1-8-4-2-1.

19:05.676 --> 19:09.111
I don't even know what we're going to do
with a dune buggy, but I want it!

19:10.606 --> 19:15.013
And the actual retail price
of your showcase is...

19:15.016 --> 19:21.170
- $14,628.
- $14,628. Millie, you are over.

19:21.188 --> 19:22.432
Too bad.

19:22.456 --> 19:27.632
Barney, you bid $18,421 on your showcase.

19:27.648 --> 19:37.693
And the actual retail price of Barney's
showcase is... $18,421 exactly right!

19:37.707 --> 19:43.121
- You win both showcases, Barney.
- Oh, my God!

19:46.276 --> 19:50.091
Bob Barker, reminding you,
help control the pet...

19:50.105 --> 19:53.322
Before, before we wrap up the show, there's
just something I want to say to you.

19:57.646 --> 20:01.242
Congratulations on 35 wonderful
years hosting The Price Is Right.

20:01.256 --> 20:03.371
Well, thank you, Barney.

20:03.388 --> 20:06.182
Thank you...
Have your pets spayed or neutered.

20:10.226 --> 20:11.640
Why didn't you tell him?

20:12.845 --> 20:14.463
Well, it's just...

20:15.775 --> 20:18.251
If you lived your whole life
thinking one thing,

20:18.266 --> 20:21.801
it would be pretty devastating
to find out that wasn't true.

20:22.858 --> 20:26.470
I just don't think Bob
could have handled it.

20:27.737 --> 20:30.700
- Bob. Yeah.
- Probably a good choice.

20:31.408 --> 20:34.650
Anyway, on the bright side.

20:35.308 --> 20:37.072
Happy wedding again!

20:37.135 --> 20:39.633
And that's the story of how
Uncle Barney gave

20:39.635 --> 20:42.331
Lily and Marshall a dune buggy
for their wedding.

20:47.328 --> 20:51.573
Um, I thought since we're going to be apart for two whole weeks,

20:51.946 --> 20:54.541
I would sing you your night-night song.

20:57.385 --> 21:00.162
Night-night, Lily

21:00.698 --> 21:03.423
Night-night, Lily

21:04.127 --> 21:09.291
It's time to go to bed, oh, my silly,
little Lily Time to rest your little head

21:09.655 --> 21:12.000
Sha-la-la-la-la

21:12.855 --> 21:14.960
Sha-la-la-la-la

21:15.606 --> 21:18.593
- Come on, Ted.
- No, it's weird.

21:18.606 --> 21:20.003
You promised.

21:22.395 --> 21:24.563
Sha-la-la-la-la

21:25.416 --> 21:27.393
Sha-la-la-la-la

21:28.076 --> 21:30.600
Sha-la-la-la-la
