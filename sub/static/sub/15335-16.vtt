THE TRAIN, WE'RE NOT THERE.

11:33.260 --> 11:35.228
GOD, YOU KNOW,
IF WE WERE REAL TERRORISTS,

11:35.262 --> 11:37.597
WE COULD REALLY WREAK SOME HAVOC
FROM THESE CONTROL ROOMS.

11:37.630 --> 11:41.534
I MEAN DERAIL A TRAIN,
SHUT DOWN ENTIRE TRAIN STATIONS.

11:41.568 --> 11:45.939
WE ARE REAL TERRORISTS
UNTIL 9:00 P.M. TOMORROW.

11:45.973 --> 11:49.242
HOW DO YOU WANT TO DO IT?
ONE MAN
TAKES THE BANKER.

11:49.276 --> 11:54.748
THE REST DO THE HIJACKING?
NO, WE'RE ALL ON OUR OWN--
INDEPENDENT OPERATORS.

11:54.782 --> 11:56.784
[ Beeping ]
ONE OF US FAILS TO GET
TO THE SIGNAL CONTROL ROOM,

11:56.817 --> 11:59.086
TRIGGERS ANOTHER TO START.

11:59.119 --> 12:01.254
[ Beeping ]

12:07.394 --> 12:10.063
WHO KNOWS WHAT THE GERMANS
WILL DO TO STOP US?

12:10.097 --> 12:13.600
IF OUR PLAN
IS OUR FIRST THOUGHT,
IT'LL BE THEIR FIRST THOUGHT.

12:15.969 --> 12:18.906
PLEASE.
I HAVE TO BE IN WICHITA.
CAN'T YOU MAKE AN EXCEPTION?

12:18.939 --> 12:23.076
NO, MA'AM. BUT I CAN
PUT YOU ON OUR NEXT FLIGHT,
WHICH IS... TOMORROW AT 4:00.

12:23.110 --> 12:25.979
TOMORROW?
YES, MA'AM.

12:26.013 --> 12:28.048
KIM?

12:28.081 --> 12:30.550
I THOUGHT THAT WAS YOU.

12:30.583 --> 12:32.619
ETHAN.

12:32.652 --> 12:35.755
OH, MY GOD.
I DON'T BELIEVE THIS.

12:35.789 --> 12:39.092
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?
THE AIRLINE LOST MY LUGGAGE.

12:39.126 --> 12:41.995
I'VE BEEN TRYING TO FIND IT,
SO I MISSED MY CONNECTING FLIGHT
TO WICHITA.

12:42.029 --> 12:44.898
I'LL TAKE YOU.
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

12:44.932 --> 12:48.001
MY PLANE'S HERE.
I'M HEADED TO DALLAS, BUT I'LL
DROP YOU OFF ON THE WAY.

12:48.035 --> 12:50.904
YOU HAVE YOUR OWN PLANE?
[ Chuckles ]

12:50.938 --> 12:53.240
ETHAN, THE PILOT'S READY
WHEN YOU ARE.

12:53.273 --> 12:55.142
LET HIM KNOW
THERE'LL BE ONE MORE.

12:55.175 --> 12:58.311
KIM, THIS IS BRUCE SMITH,
MY COMPANY V.P.
BRUCE, THIS IS KIM HARRINGTON.

12:58.345 --> 13:01.114
UH, BROWN, ACTUALLY.
KIM BROWN.

13:01.148 --> 13:03.550
OH, I HAVE A FEELING
YOU TWO GO WAY BACK.

13:05.385 --> 13:07.855
[ Chuckles ]
BRUCE, WHY DON'T YOU
GO TALK TO THE PILOT?

13:07.888 --> 13:09.689
YEAH.
I'LL GO DO THAT.

13:10.958 --> 13:13.861
WOW. IT'S REALLY GREAT
SEEING YOU AGAIN, KIM.

13:16.396 --> 13:18.065
COME ON.

13:27.340 --> 13:30.844
I KNEW YOU STARTED
A SOFTWARE COMPANY,

13:30.878 --> 13:34.514
BUT I HAD NO IDEA
IT WAS THIS SUCCESSFUL.

13:34.547 --> 13:37.885
CAN'T COMPLAIN.
OTHER THAN THE DIVORCE,
IT'S BEEN A GOOD FEW YEARS.

13:37.918 --> 13:40.087
YOU SHOULD BE VERY PROUD.

13:43.423 --> 13:46.226
SO HOW IS OLD BOB BROWN?
IS HE STILL IN THE ARMY?

13:46.259 --> 13:48.896
HE'S A CLERK IN LOGISTICAL
STUDIES AT FORT GRIFFITH.

13:48.929 --> 13:51.664
I ALWAYS FIGURED HIM
AS MORE OF AN ACTION GUY.

13:51.698 --> 13:55.102
- WELL, HE REALLY
ENJOYS WHAT HE'S DOING.
- THEN HE'S A LUCKY MAN.

13:57.570 --> 13:59.539
SO WHAT ARE YOU DOING AT THIS
CONFERENCE IN WICHITA?

13:59.572 --> 14:02.009
SELLING AD TIME
FOR OUR RADIO STATION.

14:02.042 --> 14:05.913
I NEED TO CONVINCE THE OWNER
OF ACRES AUTOMOTIVE
TO SPEND $300,000--

14:05.946 --> 14:08.148
WE'VE GOT A PROBLEM, ETHAN.

14:08.181 --> 14:11.651
I JUST GOT CONFIRMATION THAT
BRIDGECOM'S OFFERING PRELADA
450 MIL.

14:11.684 --> 14:13.853
- AND HE STAYS ON AS CHAIRMAN?
- NO, HE'D BE OUT.

14:15.923 --> 14:18.926
- WHAT'S THEIR TIMELINE?
- PRELADA'S GOT TWO HOURS
TO CONSIDER THEIR OFFER.

14:18.959 --> 14:23.063
- AND WHERE IS HE RIGHT NOW?
- [ Bruce ]
HIS RANCH IN GARLAND.

14:23.096 --> 14:27.901
TELL THE PILOT TO HEAD DIRECTLY
TO DALLAS, AND SEE IF PRELADA
WILL MEET ME AT THE OFFICE.

14:27.935 --> 14:30.170
KIM, I'M REALLY SORRY.
THIS IS AN EMERGENCY.

14:30.203 --> 14:32.940
I HOPE YOUR CONFERENCE IN
WICHITA WASN'T TOO IMPORTANT.
WELL, UM--

14:32.973 --> 14:36.676
LET ME MAKE IT UP TO YOU.
HOW MUCH AD TIME DID YOU
NEED TO SELL?

14:36.709 --> 14:38.912
300,000 DOLLARS' WORTH.
DONE.

14:38.946 --> 14:40.914
McNEAL MICROSYSTEMS
IS YOUR NEW CLIENT.

14:40.948 --> 14:43.083
OH, ETHAN, YOU DON'T
HAVE TO DO THAT.

14:43.116 --> 14:45.685
NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.
IT'S THE LEAST I CAN DO.

14:45.718 --> 14:49.089
AND SINCE I'M DRAGGING YOU OUT
TO TEXAS, WHY DON'T YOU STAY ON
AS MY GUEST THIS WEEKEND?

14:50.890 --> 14:53.460
BOB'S INVITED TOO.
I'LL SEND MY PLANE
FOR HIM LATER.

14:53.493 --> 14:57.931
NO, NO.
HE'S WORKING.
THAT'S A SHAME.

14:57.965 --> 15:01.268
A-A-AND IT'S TOO BAD
I HAVE TO TRACK DOWN MY LUGGAGE.
OTHERWISE--

15:01.301 --> 15:05.038
I'LL HAVE SOMEONE
TAKE CARE OF THAT.
COME ON. WHAT DO YOU SAY?

15:05.072 --> 15:08.976
- IT'LL GIVE US A CHANCE
TO CATCH UP.
- * YOU MIGHT EVEN HEAR

15:09.009 --> 15:12.245
ALL RIGHT. WHY NOT?
* ANGELS CHEER
'CAUSE WE'RE TOGETHER *

15:12.279 --> 15:17.317
- GREAT.
- * WEATHER-WISE
IT'S SUCH A LOVELY DAY *

15:19.519 --> 15:23.090
* JUST SAY THE WORDS
AND WE'LL BEAT THE BIRDS *

15:23.123 --> 15:26.126
* DOWN TO ACAPULCO BAY *

15:42.775 --> 15:45.112
SNAKE DOCTOR'S THROUGH
THE ENTRANCE.

15:54.054 --> 15:55.989
NO SIGN OF THE BANKER YET.

16:01.628 --> 16:05.632
SNAKE DOC, I'VE BEEN SPOTTED.
YOU GOT GSG-9
ABOUT 50 METERS BEHIND.

16:05.665 --> 16:08.001

16:32.159 --> 16:37.164
TARGET SIGHTED.
APPROACHING ENTRANCE
FROM THE EAST.

16:37.197 --> 16:39.666
[ Bob On Radio ]
THE BANKER'S HEADING
DOWN THE STAIRS. I'M IN PURSUIT.

16:45.072 --> 16:47.174
[ Chattering ]

17:01.588 --> 17:05.058
I'M OUT. BETTY BLUE,
SUBJECT'S HEADING SOUTHBOUND
TOWARDS YOU.

17:07.127 --> 17:09.229
HEY.

17:10.630 --> 17:13.533
I JUST FOUND OUT THE GERMANS
ARE THE TERRORISTS.

17:24.877 --> 17:28.815
I HAVE EYES ON THE TARGET.
REPEAT. EYES ON THE TARGET.

17:35.288 --> 17:37.224
HEADING SOUTHBOUND
ON THE U-3.

17:39.826 --> 17:42.395
IF THERE'S AN OPPORTUNITY TO
CLOSE THE DEAL, SHALL I PROCEED?

17:42.429 --> 17:44.564
ROGER, BETTY BLUE.

17:44.597 --> 17:46.399
IF YOU HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY,
TAKE HIM.

18:04.184 --> 18:06.386
THIS IS SNAKE DOC.
ON DECOY NOW.

18:06.419 --> 18:08.955

18:08.988 --> 18:10.790
ROGER THAT, SNAKE DOC.

18:26.839 --> 18:30.009
ETHAN, PRELADA'S
GONNA BE THERE.

18:30.042 --> 18:32.279
I THINK WE SHOULD UP OUR OFFER.

18:32.312 --> 18:35.448
EXCUSE ME. ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT DEAN PRELADA?

18:35.482 --> 18:37.784
YEAH. WE'RE TRYING
TO BUY HIS COMPANY.

18:37.817 --> 18:41.288
I JUST READ AN ARTICLE
IN FORBE WRITTEN BY HIS WIFE
WHO'S A JOURNALIST.

18:41.321 --> 18:44.357
RIGHT. SO, ETHAN,
WE SHOULD RUN SOME NUMBERS.
[ Ethan ] IN A MINUTE.

18:44.391 --> 18:48.161
WHAT'S THIS ARTICLE ABOUT?
WELL, IT WAS ABOUT
THEIR MARRIAGE.

18:48.195 --> 18:51.964
SHE SAID THE ONE THING
SHE LOVES MOST ABOUT HER HUSBAND
IS HOW LOYAL HE IS.

18:51.998 --> 18:55.168
- IF IT'S ACTUALLY TRUE.
- WELL, HIS EMPLOYEES
TEND TO STAY WITH HIM.

18:55.202 --> 19:00.006
HE HAS THREE GENERATIONS
OF ONE FAMILY WORKING FOR HIM.
YOU HEAR THIS?

19:00.039 --> 19:03.610
YEAH. PRELADA'S A REAL MENSCH,
BUT HE'S STILL AS GREEDY
AS THE NEXT GUY.

19:03.643 --> 19:06.446
NO. DON'T YOU SEE?
BRIDGECOM WANTS PRELADA OUT,
AND HE WON'T TAKE THEIR OFFER.

19:06.479 --> 19:09.349
- FOR AN EXTRA 50 MIL?
- IT WOULD BE DISLOYAL
TO HIS EMPLOYEES.

19:09.382 --> 19:12.118
RIGHT, KIM?
I WOULD THINK SO.

19:12.151 --> 19:15.288
COME ON. ETHAN--

19:15.322 --> 19:17.590
OUR OFFER STAYS THE SAME.
400 MIL, PRELADA GETS TO STAY.

19:18.925 --> 19:21.027
I'LL LET THE BOARD KNOW.

19:21.060 --> 19:22.995
PLEASE.

19:25.064 --> 19:27.267
THANK YOU.
FOR WHAT?

19:29.101 --> 19:31.304
BEING A BREATH
OF FRESH AIR.

19:31.338 --> 19:34.307
I HAVE A LOT OF SMART PEOPLE
QUOTING HARD DATA.

19:34.341 --> 19:37.410
SOMETIMES THEY FORGET
THE HUMAN ELEMENT.

19:37.444 --> 19:39.712
I REMEMBER YOU USED TO TALK
ABOUT GETTING YOUR M.B.A.

19:39.746 --> 19:43.250
WELL, THAT WAS A LONG TIME AGO.
BEFORE YOU WENT OFF
TO GRAD SCHOOL IN CALIFORNIA.

19:43.283 --> 19:46.052
RIGHT. AND BEFORE
YOU DUMPED ME FOR BOB.

19:46.085 --> 19:48.421
YOU WERE GONE
A YEAR AND A HALF.

19:48.455 --> 19:51.258
I'M JUST TEASING.
IT'S ANCIENT HISTORY.

19:53.560 --> 19:56.729
SO AFTER COLLEGE, WHAT HAPPENED?
I THOUGHT YOU'D BE TAKING
CORPORATE AMERICA BY STORM.

19:56.763 --> 19:59.766
ACTUALLY, I HAVEN'T
FINISHED COLLEGE YET.
[ Chuckles ]

19:59.799 --> 20:01.768
I GOT SIDETRACKED,
YOU COULD SAY.

20:01.801 --> 20:04.871
MOVING AROUND THE COUNTRY AND
HAVING KIDS'LL DO THAT TO YOU.

20:04.904 --> 20:07.540
MM-HMM.
BUT I'M BACK IN SCHOOL.

20:07.574 --> 20:09.376
I SHOULD BE GETTING
MY DEGREE NEXT SPRING.

20:11.778 --> 20:14.714
YOU KNOW, AFTER YOU GRADUATE,
YOU SHOULD COME WORK FOR ME.

20:16.215 --> 20:18.217
I THINK YOU'D HAVE A LOT
TO OFFER OUR COMPANY.

I AM JUST OFF
MERKENSTRASSE.

21:34.394 --> 21:37.964

INTO AN ALLEY.

21:46.406 --> 21:48.808
I'VE JUST LOST EYES
ON THE TARGET.

21:48.841 --> 21:50.643
REPEAT.
I'VE JUST LOST EYES--
[ Gunshot ]

21:51.978 --> 21:54.414

BETTY BLUE, COME IN.
[ Grunts ]

21:57.249 --> 21:59.151
[ Groans ]
BETTY BLUE?

21:59.185 --> 22:02.522
I'M HIT.
I'M HIT, TOP.

22:04.256 --> 22:06.626
BETTY BLUE, REPEAT.
REAL BULLET THIS TIME.

22:17.437 --> 22:20.507
STANDARD GERMAN ARMY ISSUE.

22:20.540 --> 22:23.309
IT HAD TO BE HANS--
THAT GSG-9 NEWBIE.

22:23.342 --> 22:26.646
HE WANTED PAYBACK
AFTER THE BEATING I GAVE HIM
WITH THE PUGIL STICKS.

22:26.679 --> 22:28.915
AND HE STOPPED YOU
FROM GETTIN' THE BANKER.

22:28.948 --> 22:31.518
[ Mack ] COULD'VE TAILED
HIM FROM THE STATION.
YOU SAW HIM?

22:31.551 --> 22:36.088
NO, BUT HE'S HAD IT IN FOR ME
SINCE THE FIRST EVENT WHEN
I BEAT HIM AT TARGET SHOOTING.

22:36.122 --> 22:38.491
HMM. THE GERMANS STILL
WON THAT EVENT OVERALL.

22:38.525 --> 22:41.528
EXACTLY. WHICH MEANS HANS
HAS A MAJOR SCREW LOOSE.

22:41.561 --> 22:44.363
WHAT DO YOU THINK, BOSS?
TIME TO HAVE A TALK WITH KELLER?

22:44.397 --> 22:46.766
DEFINITELY.
BUT NOT WITHOUT SOME PROOF.

22:46.799 --> 22:48.768
[ Mack ]
WHAT SORT OF PROOF?

22:48.801 --> 22:51.404
WE NEED TO GET HANS.
SET A TRAP.

22:51.438 --> 22:54.106
[ Grunts ]
WHAT ABOUT THE FINAL EVENT?

22:54.140 --> 22:56.242
FORGET ABOUT IT.

22:56.275 --> 22:58.377
THIS AIN'T A GAME ANYMORE.

22:58.411 --> 23:00.480
YOU REST AT EASE.

23:09.889 --> 23:12.592
HOW MUCH DID THIS COST?
500 EUROS.

23:12.625 --> 23:15.294
AND A BOTTLE OF FRENCH BRANDY
FOR THE DELIVERY MANAGER.

23:15.327 --> 23:17.564
WE GOT THE TRUCK
FOR 30 MINUTES.

23:17.597 --> 23:19.566
GOOD WORK.

23:20.900 --> 23:22.869
WHAT IF HANS
DOESN'T SHOW UP?

23:22.902 --> 23:25.972
HE DOESN'T WANT US TO WIN.
HE'LL SHOW UP.

23:56.769 --> 23:58.538
[ Engine Starts ]

24:04.844 --> 24:07.313
GO SLOW.
LET HIM GET A GOOD LOOK FIRST.

24:09.348 --> 24:11.350
RIGHT THIS WAY,
HERR STROLLEN.

24:12.218 --> 24:14.120

24:50.923 --> 24:52.892
THIS IS WHERE YOU LIVE?

24:52.925 --> 24:55.662

I'VE BEEN VERY LUCKY.

25:16.616 --> 25:20.653
ETHAN, THIS IS BEAUTIFUL.

25:20.687 --> 25:22.555
I CAN'T TAKE ANY CREDIT
FOR IT.

25:22.589 --> 25:25.057
I'LL TELL MY DECORATOR
YOU APPROVE.

25:25.091 --> 25:27.293
COME ON.
LET ME SHOW YOU TO YOUR ROOM.

25:30.029 --> 25:32.064
APPARENTLY, YOUR LUGGAGE
NEVER LEFT HOME,

25:32.098 --> 25:34.500
SO I HAD MY ASSISTANT PICK UP
A FEW THINGS FOR YOU.

25:34.533 --> 25:36.569
THEY SHOULD FIT.

25:36.603 --> 25:40.272
LET ME KNOW
IF YOU NEED ANYTHING.
OKAY.

25:40.306 --> 25:43.309
I GOT SOME WORK TO DO.
DINNER IN AN HOUR?

26:09.401 --> 26:12.772
LISTEN, FRIEND,
NO ONE BLAMES YOU
FOR THIS SITUATION.

26:12.805 --> 26:15.107
WE ALL KNOW THAT YOU'RE
A FINE, UPSTANDING STUDENT.

26:15.141 --> 26:17.376
[ Gasps ]

26:17.409 --> 26:21.447
YOU WERE PAID TO DO A JOB,
BUT YOU GOT INTO SOMETHING
OVER YOUR HEAD.

26:21.480 --> 26:23.983
TELL US WHO YOU WORK FOR,
WHO ASKED YOU TO PLANT THE BUG,

26:24.016 --> 26:26.919
AND YOU'LL BE
ON YOUR WAY HOME, ANDREAS.

26:26.953 --> 26:31.123
HE SAID IT WAS JUST A GAME,
THAT NO ONE WOULD GET HURT.

26:31.157 --> 26:34.260
IT WAS SOMETHING HE
AND HIS OLD UNIVERSITY FRIENDS
DID EVERY YEAR.

26:34.293 --> 26:37.596
WHO SAID THAT?
WAS IT HANS?

26:38.665 --> 26:41.067
HIS NAME IS FARID.

26:41.100 --> 26:43.135
I DON'T KNOW A LAST NAME.

26:43.169 --> 26:46.405
HE SAID HE WAS FROM SYRIA.
WHERE DID YOU MEET HIM?

26:46.438 --> 26:49.909
OUTSIDE THE HOTEL.
HE GAVE ME 8,000 EUROS...

26:49.942 --> 26:53.012
TO PLANT A BUG IN YOUR ROOM.

26:53.045 --> 26:55.114
LATER, HE TOLD ME
TO FOLLOW YOU,

26:55.147 --> 26:58.617
TO STOP YOU FROM KIDNAPPING
A MAN WITH A BRIEFCASE.

26:58.651 --> 27:01.688
HE GAVE ME A GUN
WITH FAKE BULLETS.

27:01.721 --> 27:03.790
THERE WAS NOTHING FAKE
ABOUT THOSE BULLETS, SON.

27:03.823 --> 27:05.892
WHAT ELSE?

27:07.626 --> 27:11.664
HE JUST ASKED A LOT OF QUESTIONS
ABOUT THE U-BAHN.

27:15.702 --> 27:18.604
YOU BELIEVE THE WAITER IS PART
OF A TERRORIST CELL?

27:18.637 --> 27:21.373
CAN'T SAY FOR SURE,
BUT I DON'T THINK SO.

27:21.407 --> 27:23.676
HE'S A SCARED KID.

27:23.710 --> 27:25.644
HE WAS PAID TO DO A JOB.

27:25.678 --> 27:28.147
HOW DID SOMEONE FIND OUT
ABOUT THE GAMES?

27:28.180 --> 27:30.616
SECURITY AMONG SUPPORT STAFF
HAS ALWAYS BEEN A CONCERN.

27:30.649 --> 27:33.652
THE POINT IS,
WE'VE UNCOVERED A MAJOR PROBLEM.

POTENTIAL TERRORIST FIXATED
ON THE U-BAHN SYSTEM.

27:36.689 --> 27:38.725
HE'S GOT MORE
THAN JUST AN ITCH.

27:38.758 --> 27:42.661
THE WAITER PLANTED A BUG WHILE
WE WERE TALKING STRATEGY,

27:42.695 --> 27:45.531
