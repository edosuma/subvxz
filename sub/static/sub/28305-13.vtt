WEBVTT

00:02.045 --> 00:03.960
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Welcome back, friends.
Let me catch you up.

00:04.004 --> 00:06.093
Jane was trying
to move on from Rafael.

00:06.136 --> 00:08.095
And Petra was trying
to move on from J.R.

00:08.138 --> 00:10.445
Luckily, they had
each other to lean on.

00:10.488 --> 00:12.055
But then this happened.

00:12.099 --> 00:14.057
What is it?I love you.

00:14.101 --> 00:15.450
Yes, friends. Jane and Rafael

00:15.493 --> 00:17.582
finally got back together.

00:17.626 --> 00:18.975
So it looks
like Petra has to do

00:19.019 --> 00:20.324
the single lady thing
on her own.

00:20.368 --> 00:22.239
But at least she got one
of her exes back.

00:22.283 --> 00:24.589
That's right,
her old assistant Krishna.

00:24.633 --> 00:27.157
And I want a lunch hour
every day.

00:27.201 --> 00:29.029
Every day? Oh, it's a deal.

00:29.072 --> 00:30.639
NARRATOR:
And she could use
all the help she could get

00:30.682 --> 00:32.162
because her ex-husband Milos

00:32.206 --> 00:34.947
was threatening to sell the Marbella out from under her

00:34.991 --> 00:36.601
unless Petra lied about him
under oath.

00:36.645 --> 00:38.342
So she was forced
to make a decision.

00:38.386 --> 00:40.127
My lawyers can't stop Milos
from selling the hotel.

00:40.170 --> 00:41.867
Well, you've
found ways around

00:41.911 --> 00:43.434
that kind of thing
before, right?

00:43.478 --> 00:44.783
Yes, but that would
involve lying,

00:44.827 --> 00:46.220
and I can't do that anymore.

00:46.263 --> 00:47.482
NARRATOR:
That's right,
she told Milos no.

00:47.525 --> 00:49.266
KRISHNA:
Petra won't perjure herself.

00:49.310 --> 00:51.138
Only problem... But I will.

00:51.181 --> 00:53.270
I know!
Straight out of a telenovela.

00:53.314 --> 00:55.446
Which brings me to Rogelio.

00:55.490 --> 00:58.841
See, his telenovela,This Is
Mars, was finally blasting off.

01:01.278 --> 01:02.714
Because I'm half-human,
half-Martian.

01:02.758 --> 01:04.847
I've started to evolve.
Didn't you read the script?

01:04.890 --> 01:06.196
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
I know, pretty wild, right?

01:06.240 --> 01:07.980
Then again, it is a telenovela.

01:08.024 --> 01:10.809
So let's get back to ours.

01:10.853 --> 01:13.551
When Jane Gloriana Villanueva

01:13.595 --> 01:15.292
was 30 years old...

01:15.336 --> 01:18.904
she and Rafael
got back together. Again.

01:18.948 --> 01:21.516
And, friends, it was romantic.

01:21.559 --> 01:23.126
It was magical.

01:23.170 --> 01:24.910
It was...

01:24.954 --> 01:27.174
NSFW.

01:27.217 --> 01:29.176
Uh, why don't we skip ahead
a little?

01:29.219 --> 01:31.003
Oh, wow, they...

01:31.047 --> 01:32.440
they're still going at it.

01:32.483 --> 01:35.225
Okay, now we're good.

01:35.269 --> 01:37.358
I am so happy.
Me, too.

01:37.401 --> 01:39.925
I love you so much.I love you.

01:41.840 --> 01:43.146
Okay, so what now?

01:43.190 --> 01:45.888
We start dating?
Take it slow?

01:45.931 --> 01:47.977
Screw taking it slow.

01:48.020 --> 01:49.587
Let's pick up
right where we left off.

01:49.631 --> 01:51.894
Thank God. That's
what I want to do.

01:51.937 --> 01:54.201
So... where were we?

01:54.244 --> 01:56.290
Well... you were living here.

01:56.333 --> 01:57.813
I'll move back in tomorrow.

01:57.856 --> 01:59.380
And I was going to propose.

01:59.423 --> 02:00.990
Yeah.

02:01.033 --> 02:02.948
You were.

02:04.602 --> 02:07.170
You jerk.

02:08.911 --> 02:11.174
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Seriously? Again?

02:11.218 --> 02:12.828
Yes, seriously.

02:12.871 --> 02:15.874
And we are back
forever and ever this time.

02:15.918 --> 02:17.920
I'm so happy for you, hon.

02:20.966 --> 02:24.144
Yeah, but he was actually
kind of low-key about it.

02:25.754 --> 02:27.408
I know.

02:27.451 --> 02:28.844
I'm hoping it's not
his meds, you know?

02:28.887 --> 02:30.237
Dulling his personality?

02:30.280 --> 02:32.021
Tell me what you think
at dinner tomorrow.

02:32.064 --> 02:34.066
JORGE:
We're not just having dinner.

02:36.939 --> 02:39.028
Ooh, okay, fun.

02:39.071 --> 02:40.595
What are we playing?

02:40.638 --> 02:41.944
Actually...

02:41.987 --> 02:44.076
look what I found in the closet.

02:44.120 --> 02:46.557
Lotería.
Uh-oh.

02:47.993 --> 02:49.560
We don't play lotería
in this family.

02:49.604 --> 02:51.432
Why not?

02:53.303 --> 02:54.783
Hmm.LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
I'll say.

02:56.741 --> 02:58.787
Lotería!
You cheated.

02:59.962 --> 03:02.182
You called all the cards
except the one I need.

03:02.225 --> 03:04.619
You took el barril,
didn't you, you cheater?

03:06.577 --> 03:09.232
Yes, you did. You
cheated and I hate you.

03:09.276 --> 03:10.755
I wish it was
just me and Dad.

03:11.930 --> 03:13.628
Well, that was a long time ago.

03:13.671 --> 03:15.151
Surely you've both
moved on, right?

03:17.327 --> 03:18.763
If the cheater's moved on,

03:18.807 --> 03:20.417
then I have, too.JORGE:
Perfect.

03:20.461 --> 03:22.114
Loteríait is.

03:22.158 --> 03:24.421
JANE: Okay, well,
I should get going.

03:24.465 --> 03:27.642
I've got to move my stuff
into my new home

03:27.685 --> 03:30.210
that I share
with my soon-to-be fiancé.

03:30.253 --> 03:31.515
XIOMARA:
Wow.

03:31.559 --> 03:32.516
You really think he's
gonna propose so soon?

03:32.560 --> 03:34.039
I'm hoping.

03:34.083 --> 03:35.911
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
To be clear, not just hoping.

03:39.567 --> 03:41.003
Straight-up snooping.

03:41.046 --> 03:42.874
RAFAEL:
Looking for this?

03:46.748 --> 03:48.880
No. I was just, uh...

03:48.924 --> 03:51.056
making room for my stuff.

03:51.100 --> 03:54.799
Oh, making room for your stuff
in my sock drawer?

03:54.843 --> 03:56.975
Yeah. I think it's...

03:57.019 --> 04:00.327
nice when couples...
share socks.

04:03.939 --> 04:05.723
Go ahead.

04:05.767 --> 04:07.290
Open it.

04:07.334 --> 04:09.336
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
OMG, it's finally happening.

04:13.470 --> 04:15.298
I had a feeling you might
come snooping around,

04:15.342 --> 04:17.300
so I hid the ring.

04:17.344 --> 04:18.649
You won't catch
a glimpse of it

04:18.693 --> 04:20.347
until I want you to.

04:33.534 --> 04:35.971
Petra, hey, I, uh,
I wasn't expecting you.

04:36.014 --> 04:37.973
The girls forgot their music
books for their violin lessons.

04:38.016 --> 04:40.628
U-Um... I will, um...

04:40.671 --> 04:42.325
get them for you.

04:44.022 --> 04:45.285
Oh, God.

04:45.328 --> 04:47.852
You're clearly...
busy with someone.

04:47.896 --> 04:49.680
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Or getting busy with someone.

04:49.724 --> 04:51.029
I'm sorry. I'll get out
of your hair.

04:52.466 --> 04:54.685
Wait, you're here with
a waitress from the Marbella?

04:54.729 --> 04:56.644
Yes?

04:56.687 --> 04:58.123
Well...

04:58.167 --> 05:00.343
you don't work there anymore,
so I guess it's fine.

05:00.387 --> 05:02.084
Have fun.

05:02.911 --> 05:04.347
You're getting busy with Jane?

05:04.391 --> 05:06.480
I, I...Jane, get out here!

05:08.264 --> 05:10.962
Hi, Petra.Oh, well, so much for
our single ladies' pact.

05:11.006 --> 05:12.355
I'm sorry.

05:12.399 --> 05:14.226
I was gonna tell you
when I saw you in person.

05:14.270 --> 05:16.751
I-I... I don't want you to
think I'm abandoning you.

05:16.794 --> 05:19.449
Oh, so this is just
a one-night stand?

05:19.493 --> 05:21.233
Well, I mean...

05:21.277 --> 05:23.366
no.
It's fine.

05:23.410 --> 05:25.368
I'm kidding.
Congrats, I'm thrilled for you.

05:25.412 --> 05:26.761
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
She doesn't look thrilled.

05:27.588 --> 05:29.111
Uh, it's fine, okay?

05:29.154 --> 05:30.721
I'm just stressed
because of this Milos stuff.

05:30.765 --> 05:32.070
The trial's next week.

05:32.114 --> 05:33.376
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Which brings us to...

05:33.420 --> 05:35.117
Krishna, I need some help.

05:35.160 --> 05:36.553
Please.

05:36.597 --> 05:38.120
KRISHNA:
Two more minutes.

05:42.603 --> 05:44.387
I just need you
to scan something.

05:44.431 --> 05:46.389
I have 90 seconds left
of my lunch break.

05:46.433 --> 05:48.652
There'll be plenty of time
for nail art

05:48.696 --> 05:51.089
after Milos's trial, okay?
Once he's a convicted felon,

05:51.133 --> 05:53.353
I can sue for his shares
and get my hotel back.

05:53.396 --> 05:54.919
Agreed--
he'll never see it coming.Which is why

05:54.963 --> 05:57.269
I need you to scan this
and send to the lawyers ASAP.

05:57.313 --> 05:58.575
So can you please
get back to work?

05:58.619 --> 06:00.098
It's been at least 90 seconds.

06:00.142 --> 06:02.362
I reset the clock
when you started talking.

06:28.388 --> 06:29.954
Finally.
Actually,

06:29.998 --> 06:31.303
I have a dentist's appointment.

06:31.347 --> 06:32.957
I e-mailed you about it
last week,

06:33.001 --> 06:35.003
but when I get back
I'll be all yours.

06:42.184 --> 06:43.577
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
That's not her dentist!

06:43.620 --> 06:44.708
It's on.

06:44.752 --> 06:46.667
Petra has no idea.

06:46.710 --> 06:48.277
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Uh-oh.

06:48.320 --> 06:50.671
No, I'm not in the
mood for scary.

06:50.714 --> 06:52.150
Let's watch a comedy.

06:52.194 --> 06:54.152
Okay,
but first...

06:54.196 --> 06:56.546
I have a question
I want to ask you.

06:56.590 --> 06:58.548
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Or how about a romance?

07:06.382 --> 07:07.949
Have you seen my phone anywhere?

07:07.992 --> 07:09.777
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
You're killing us, Rafael.

07:11.039 --> 07:13.781
Oh, I... oh, I hate you.

07:13.824 --> 07:16.000
So mean!

07:16.044 --> 07:17.959
I just want to surprise
you, and I will.

07:18.002 --> 07:19.700
No. No way.
Mm-hmm.

07:19.743 --> 07:21.484
My senses
are heightened now.

07:21.528 --> 07:23.355
There's no way
I won't see it coming.
Mm-mm.

07:23.399 --> 07:25.227
Mm-hmm.

07:25.270 --> 07:26.358
RAFAEL:
Hey, bud.

07:26.402 --> 07:27.708
Aren't you happy
we're all together?

07:28.709 --> 07:30.580
You want to come snuggle

07:30.624 --> 07:31.973
with us and watch a movie?

07:32.016 --> 07:34.323
No, I just came out
to get more paper.

07:36.325 --> 07:37.674
Okay, I definitely think
the meds

07:37.718 --> 07:39.981
are affecting
his emotions.
Yeah, me, too.

07:40.024 --> 07:43.680
We should talk
to his doctor.

07:46.030 --> 07:47.379
So, how was
your doctor's appointment?

07:47.423 --> 07:48.642
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
That was fast.

07:48.685 --> 07:50.252
Oh, her appointment.

07:50.295 --> 07:52.515
Easy, fine.
Sorry I'm late.

07:52.559 --> 07:54.082
What took you
so long?

07:54.125 --> 07:55.997
Oh.  It was
just one of those days.

07:56.040 --> 07:57.694
Everyone was
running behind.

07:57.738 --> 07:59.740
Okay. I'm here.

07:59.783 --> 08:02.394
Let's get this game going.Hmm!

08:02.438 --> 08:03.744
Mom.

08:03.787 --> 08:04.788
Try not to cheat again.

08:04.832 --> 08:05.789
Ay.

08:05.833 --> 08:07.182
Bueno.

08:16.800 --> 08:18.236
RAFAEL:
Wait.

08:18.280 --> 08:19.542
So this is just bingo?

08:19.586 --> 08:22.153
It's much more fun than bingo.

08:22.197 --> 08:23.677
XIOMARA: Each card
has a riddle on it,

08:23.720 --> 08:24.982
and if you can solve
the riddle first,

08:25.026 --> 08:26.549
you have a better chance
of winning.

08:28.812 --> 08:30.684
Well, you can't solve a saying.

08:32.033 --> 08:34.339
Some cards have sayings
and some have riddles.

08:34.383 --> 08:36.472
It doesn't matter.RAFAEL: Well,
I'm a little confused still.

08:36.516 --> 08:38.605
So, can I be the caller
for this round

08:38.648 --> 08:40.432
and then I can get a handle
on all the riddles?

08:40.476 --> 08:42.565
Or the sayings.

08:44.393 --> 08:45.481
RAFAEL:
Okay.

08:47.918 --> 08:50.225
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Let's... lotería.

08:54.838 --> 08:56.100
Oh, mermaid.

08:56.144 --> 08:57.841
Yes.
Oh...

09:05.501 --> 09:07.503
Ooh, I got the tree.
Y'all are going down.

09:13.683 --> 09:15.772
A ring.

09:15.816 --> 09:16.991
I don't have it.
Mm.

09:17.034 --> 09:18.383
Me neither.

09:35.400 --> 09:36.488
Jane...

09:38.578 --> 09:41.450
Will you marry me?

09:41.493 --> 09:42.930
Yes.

09:44.714 --> 09:46.629
Yes...

09:46.673 --> 09:48.109
Oh.

09:48.152 --> 09:49.284
Oh...

09:49.327 --> 09:51.547
Yes.

09:53.244 --> 09:54.376
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Now that's...

09:54.419 --> 09:57.205
a winning hand.

10:03.690 --> 10:06.170
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
As you may recall,
Jane and Rafael were...

10:06.214 --> 10:07.650
Engaged, finally.

10:07.694 --> 10:10.000
Finally? We've been
back together two days.

10:10.044 --> 10:11.219
JANE:
Mm!

10:11.262 --> 10:12.699
What do you
think, Mateo?

10:26.582 --> 10:29.498
Hey, Mr. Sweetface.
What's wrong?

10:29.541 --> 10:31.456
Nothing.

10:31.500 --> 10:33.807
Is your new medication
making you feel tired?

10:33.850 --> 10:35.199
I'm not tired.

10:35.243 --> 10:37.462
Then why aren't you excited
that Mommy and Daddy

10:37.506 --> 10:38.812
are getting married?

10:38.855 --> 10:40.683
'Cause I don't think
it's really gonna happen.

10:40.727 --> 10:43.817
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Yeah, can't blame that
on ADHD medication.

10:43.860 --> 10:45.427
Of course it's gonna happen.

10:45.470 --> 10:47.342
Look, I've got a ring
and everything.

10:47.385 --> 10:49.997
Doesn't mean you're gonna do it.
You guys always break up.

10:50.040 --> 10:52.173
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
I mean, he's not wrong.

10:52.216 --> 10:54.566
This time is different,
I promise.

10:54.610 --> 10:56.917
We aregonna
get married.When?

10:56.960 --> 10:59.267
Soon.Before my karate belt test?

10:59.310 --> 11:01.573
Your karate belt test
is in three weeks, Mateo.

11:01.617 --> 11:03.314
So could we do it before?

11:04.489 --> 11:06.100
W...

11:06.143 --> 11:07.971
We could just go
to the courthouse.

11:10.539 --> 11:12.846
We've both already had
big, fancy weddings...

11:12.889 --> 11:14.935
Please, please, please?All right.

11:14.978 --> 11:17.459
Let's do it.
I'm in.

11:17.502 --> 11:18.982
Yay, I'm so happy!

11:20.723 --> 11:22.682
ROGELIO:
I'm just so sad...

11:22.725 --> 11:27.121
to say that this is
our last day of shooting.

11:27.164 --> 11:29.123
Over the past
few weeks,

11:29.166 --> 11:31.995
I feel I've gotten to know
you all so well.

11:33.693 --> 11:35.869
Maybe not in name...

11:35.912 --> 11:38.480
or individually...

11:38.523 --> 11:40.961
but definitely in spirit.

11:41.004 --> 11:43.137
So the fact that
this experience is over,

11:43.180 --> 11:45.835
makes my heart break.

11:49.534 --> 11:50.884
Actually, we're not done yet.

11:56.367 --> 11:57.760
What's going on?

11:57.804 --> 12:00.241
We had some performance issues.

12:00.284 --> 12:01.808
We're going to need
some reshoots.

12:01.851 --> 12:04.245
River chewed the scenery again?

12:04.288 --> 12:06.464
Actually, the
problem is you.

12:09.250 --> 12:12.253
See how here it looks like
you really need to poop

12:12.296 --> 12:13.776
but you're
holding it in?

12:13.820 --> 12:16.605
You can tell the senator
from Phobos that her

12:16.648 --> 12:20.783
budget deal is a steaming pile
of antimatter!

12:20.827 --> 12:22.437
ROGELIO:
Ah...

12:22.480 --> 12:24.091
Well, in my defense,
uh, performing

12:24.134 --> 12:26.223
with an alien appendage
strapped to your behind

12:26.267 --> 12:28.965
is harder than it looks.Yeah. I get it.

12:29.009 --> 12:30.880
We didn't give you
any rehearsal time,

12:30.924 --> 12:32.534
and animatronics
take work.

12:32.577 --> 12:34.623
But the network
watched the dailies,

12:34.666 --> 12:36.016
and now they're
freaking out

12:36.059 --> 12:39.323
and calling the tail
a "pilot-killer."

12:39.367 --> 12:41.064
We have to reshoot
some scenes,

12:41.108 --> 12:44.764
and you have to find a way to
make that tail more natural.

12:46.766 --> 12:48.376
And that's why
I'll be wearing it

12:48.419 --> 12:49.638
for the next week
or so.

12:49.681 --> 12:51.422
Day and night.

12:51.466 --> 12:54.512
Won't it be
uncomfortable?

12:54.556 --> 12:56.732
There's already some chafing.

12:56.776 --> 12:58.952
But art is suffering.

13:02.956 --> 13:05.915
It's your oncologist.
Shouldn't you pick up?

13:05.959 --> 13:07.221
I'm sure it's a billing thing.

13:07.264 --> 13:08.875
But you just had tests done.

13:08.918 --> 13:11.399
It's fine. I'll call
them back later.

13:12.748 --> 13:14.097
PETRA:
What's going on?

13:14.141 --> 13:16.360
I was thinking we could do
a girls' night tonight.

13:16.404 --> 13:17.797
We can order Thai food

13:17.840 --> 13:19.363
and get those sweet pickles
you like for dessert.

13:19.407 --> 13:20.800
Oh, n-- actually, I...

13:20.843 --> 13:22.976
Also, I wanted to tell you
Raf and I are engaged.

13:23.019 --> 13:24.151
Oh, wow.

13:24.194 --> 13:25.326
Congratulations.

13:25.369 --> 13:26.849
And your first stop was...

13:26.893 --> 13:29.939
here, to ask me
to be your maid of honor?

13:29.983 --> 13:31.854
Oh, uh... ugh,
actually, no.

13:31.898 --> 13:33.943
We're just gonna do
a small courthouse thing

13:33.987 --> 13:35.118
in a few weeks, but

13:35.162 --> 13:37.294
I want to make sure you know

13:37.338 --> 13:38.992
that even though we're not
both single ladies anymore,

13:39.035 --> 13:40.689
I'm still here for you
no matter what.

13:40.732 --> 13:42.517
Starting tonight.
So...

13:42.560 --> 13:44.562
catch me up.
What's happening with Milos?

13:44.606 --> 13:45.825
Nothing.

13:45.868 --> 13:47.000
Oh, come on.
The trial's coming up.

13:47.043 --> 13:48.610
You must have some kind of plan.

13:48.653 --> 13:50.351
Okay. You know what? Let's not
do this. You need to leave.

13:50.394 --> 13:51.526
Why?

13:51.569 --> 13:53.006
Because I'm upset
with you, Jane.

13:53.049 --> 13:55.878
Clearly, but... why?

13:55.922 --> 13:56.879
Why do you think?

13:58.054 --> 13:59.186
Okay, first you abandon me,

13:59.229 --> 14:01.101
and now this whole
maid of honor thing.

14:02.232 --> 14:04.147
I've never been one, okay?

14:04.191 --> 14:05.627
And even though
I don't want to wear

14:05.670 --> 14:07.890
some poofy mint green dress,

14:07.934 --> 14:09.674
I was willing to do it
because it's something people do

14:09.718 --> 14:11.502
when they have good friends,
and you were my only chance.

14:11.546 --> 14:13.678
Oh, Petra...

14:13.722 --> 14:15.158
Okay, please, fine.
I'll get over it, all right?

14:15.202 --> 14:17.639
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I have work to do.

14:26.909 --> 14:28.432
RAFAEL:
Petra wants to wearthat?

14:28.476 --> 14:32.523
She said she wanted a poofy
mint green maid of honor dress.

14:32.567 --> 14:34.395
So, this is what I could find
on short notice.

14:34.438 --> 14:36.658
It's halfway between
a gesture and a joke.

14:36.701 --> 14:38.355
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
I'd say it's closer to a joke.

14:38.399 --> 14:40.096
Well, I think you are
very thoughtful,

14:40.140 --> 14:41.750
my soon-to-be wife...

14:41.793 --> 14:43.752
Oh, I love you so much,
soon-to-be husband...

14:43.795 --> 14:44.753
WOMAN:
Next!

14:44.796 --> 14:47.799
Ooh! Hey. Sorry.

14:47.843 --> 14:49.279
We're here
for our marriage license.

14:49.323 --> 14:51.151
As you can probably tell.
Paperwork?

14:51.194 --> 14:52.587
Oh... here you go.

14:52.630 --> 14:54.415
Signed, sealed, delivered.
Oh, yeah.

14:54.458 --> 14:56.939
Next!

14:56.983 --> 14:59.420
Wow. That is not as momentous
as I thought it would be,

14:59.463 --> 15:00.638
but okay.

15:00.682 --> 15:02.162
Is that
where it happens?

15:02.205 --> 15:05.034
Can we take
a peek inside?Knock yourself out.

15:05.078 --> 15:07.080
Next!

15:08.081 --> 15:10.518
Oh, wow.

15:10.561 --> 15:12.302
RAFAEL:
It's not...

15:12.346 --> 15:13.434
thatbad.

15:13.477 --> 15:15.915
No, it-it's charming,
in its own way.

15:15.958 --> 15:17.351
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
What way isthat?

15:17.394 --> 15:19.875
For instance, that hole is in

15:19.919 --> 15:21.572
the exact shape
of a fist.

15:21.616 --> 15:23.923
Which is not something
you see every day.

15:23.966 --> 15:25.098
True.Mm.

15:25.141 --> 15:27.839
And neither are
stains on the wall...

15:27.883 --> 15:29.841
How do you think they got there?

15:31.582 --> 15:33.976
Oh!Oh.

15:34.020 --> 15:35.717
Oh-ho-ho-ho...

15:38.459 --> 15:40.069
It's okay.
I have three weeks.

15:40.113 --> 15:43.203
I'll fix the dress
and maybe wallpaper the room

15:43.246 --> 15:44.204
while I'm at it.

15:44.247 --> 15:45.901
You know what?

15:45.945 --> 15:47.990
The ceremony's just a formality.

15:48.034 --> 15:49.600
Why don't we go
somewhere special

15:49.644 --> 15:50.993
after the wedding to celebrate?

15:51.037 --> 15:53.430
That sounds great. Where?

15:53.474 --> 15:55.171
Well, there's always...Don't say the Marbella.

15:55.215 --> 15:56.433
I was going to say

15:56.477 --> 15:58.000
Le Coeur.

15:58.044 --> 16:00.263
Le Coeur.

16:00.307 --> 16:02.091
I've always wanted to go there.

16:02.135 --> 16:03.963
But it's so expensive.

16:04.006 --> 16:05.442
It's our wedding.
It's worth it.

16:05.486 --> 16:07.444
Let's book a private room
for 12.

16:07.488 --> 16:09.316
You can't get much
more special than that.

16:11.535 --> 16:16.714
Ooh-la-la, Le Coeur.
They're going fancy.

16:22.198 --> 16:24.984
You should get it, right?Yeah. I'll be right back.

16:29.031 --> 16:30.076
Okay...

16:44.525 --> 16:46.222
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Me neither. I'll write it.

17:10.246 --> 17:11.465
What's going on?

17:15.121 --> 17:17.079
And that we're here for you,
no matter what.

17:17.123 --> 17:18.820
Why are you guys
acting so weird?

17:18.863 --> 17:22.041
We are worried that
your cancer is back,

17:22.084 --> 17:25.174
and we think you haven't
said anything to us because

17:25.218 --> 17:27.524
you don't want to ruin
Jane's wedding.

17:35.271 --> 17:38.318
Don't worry.
It's not back.

17:38.361 --> 17:40.537
Oh... thank God.Ay...

17:42.452 --> 17:45.238
So? Then why have you been
acting weird?

17:45.281 --> 17:47.022
You said you'd respect
my privacy.

17:47.066 --> 17:48.719
No. Alba said
she would.

17:48.763 --> 17:50.156
I have no respect
for your privacy.

17:50.199 --> 17:51.374
I need to know.

17:51.418 --> 17:53.855
Okay, fine.

17:53.898 --> 17:56.814
That wasn't my doctor.
It was my nurse.

17:56.858 --> 17:58.773
I've been picking
her brain because

17:58.816 --> 18:01.080
I'm thinking about going
to nursing school.

18:01.123 --> 18:02.298
Xiomara!

18:02.342 --> 18:04.474
Oh, my God!
You will be the best

18:04.518 --> 18:05.736
nurse in the world!

18:06.520 --> 18:08.435
Hey... hey, guys.

18:08.478 --> 18:10.350
Hello, Mr. Sweetface,
we're home!

18:11.351 --> 18:14.354
So... what's
going on?

18:14.397 --> 18:16.138
Your mom is going
to nursing school!

18:16.182 --> 18:18.053
That's amazing!

18:18.097 --> 18:19.837
I'm thinking
about it.

18:19.881 --> 18:21.056
Hey!

18:21.100 --> 18:22.797
Have you started
the application process yet?

18:22.840 --> 18:24.886
I can help you with the essays
or proofreading or...

18:24.929 --> 18:27.671
Slow down. I want to figure
it out on my own first.

18:27.715 --> 18:29.717
Make sure it's
really what I want

18:29.760 --> 18:32.372
before a million people
get into my head about it.

18:32.415 --> 18:34.504
We weren't gonna do that.

18:34.548 --> 18:38.117
Of course not.
I'm just so happy!

18:38.160 --> 18:40.597
Sorry. At your leisure.

18:40.641 --> 18:43.905
So, wedding at that
fancy-pants restaurant?

18:43.948 --> 18:46.212
As long as they have
availability in the next month.

18:46.255 --> 18:47.517
I'm not wearing that.

18:47.561 --> 18:49.780
It's for Petra.
Long story.

18:49.824 --> 18:51.217
Abuela, can I borrow
your sewing machine?

18:54.959 --> 18:56.222
So things are moving
pretty fast,

18:56.265 --> 18:57.745
and we could really
use your help.

18:57.788 --> 18:59.616
Jane's probably gonna have
a to-do list by tomorrow.

18:59.660 --> 19:01.096
Of course.Anything you need.

19:01.140 --> 19:04.099
I'd love to help, too.
But what's the rush?

19:04.143 --> 19:07.015
So Michael doesn't come back
and take Mommy away again.

19:07.058 --> 19:09.713
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Geez, kid,
way to kill the mood.

19:13.848 --> 19:15.719
I'm thinking
twinkly lights.

19:15.763 --> 19:17.634
Easy to plug in,
easy to take out.

19:17.678 --> 19:19.941
Maybe they'll distract from
the fist-hole in the wall.

19:19.984 --> 19:22.944
And I know there'll be no time
for vows, but I'm thinking

19:22.987 --> 19:24.728
we can say them at Le Coeur,
assuming they'll take us,

19:24.772 --> 19:25.773
They still haven't
called me back.

19:25.816 --> 19:27.383
What happened in Montana?

19:27.427 --> 19:29.037
What?

19:29.080 --> 19:30.560
With Michael.

19:31.996 --> 19:37.088
I never asked you because
I didn't think I wanted to know.

19:37.132 --> 19:39.047
I still don't.

19:39.090 --> 19:41.876
But now I think I have to.

19:44.444 --> 19:46.446
Okay, yeah.

19:46.489 --> 19:49.318
We just worked on the ranch
most of the weekend.

19:49.362 --> 19:52.974
But there was one night
we had to camp outside,

19:53.017 --> 19:57.065
and it got pretty late,
and, uh...

19:57.108 --> 20:01.025
we were laying there,
joking around, and then...

20:01.069 --> 20:04.246
we kissed.

20:04.290 --> 20:06.248
And then we
fell asleep,

20:06.292 --> 20:07.815
and that's,
that's all.

20:07.858 --> 20:11.384
Because I realized
I was in love with you.

20:11.427 --> 20:12.950
And I'm sorry

20:12.994 --> 20:15.388
it happened.
I wish it hadn't,

20:15.431 --> 20:16.911
because then
we'd already be married,

20:16.954 --> 20:18.521
which is all I want.

20:21.350 --> 20:22.612
Me, too.

20:24.005 --> 20:26.529
And we will be.

20:34.363 --> 20:37.236
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
And from one anxious
Villanueva woman...

20:37.279 --> 20:38.628
to another.

20:38.672 --> 20:39.803
ROGELIO:
♪ It's another beautiful day

20:39.847 --> 20:41.370
♪ To be a student nurse

20:41.414 --> 20:43.372
♪ My wife's going to be
a student nurse. ♪

20:43.416 --> 20:45.809
Rogelio...Sorry.

20:45.853 --> 20:48.725
Sorry.
Do your research.

20:48.769 --> 20:50.336
I'll zip it.

21:13.359 --> 21:14.621
JANE:
Oh, no.

21:14.664 --> 21:17.493
Tomorrow?
That won't work.

21:17.537 --> 21:19.539
Well, thanks anyway.

21:19.582 --> 21:22.716
Le Coeur is booked solid
for the next two months.

21:22.759 --> 21:24.239
They had a cancellation
for tomorrow,

21:24.283 --> 21:25.371
but obviously that's too soon.

21:25.414 --> 21:27.329
Why?What?

21:27.373 --> 21:29.331
Seriously, what are we
waiting for?

21:29.375 --> 21:30.463
I mean, you said it yourself

21:30.506 --> 21:31.551
that you wish we were
already married,

21:31.594 --> 21:32.552
so let's just do it.

21:32.595 --> 21:34.684
Start our life together.

21:34.728 --> 21:38.166
You're right.
Let's do it.

21:40.255 --> 21:41.256
I'll call the restaurant back

21:41.300 --> 21:43.214
and tell them to plan
for a wedding.

21:44.912 --> 21:47.480
Yes, which is why I need
to fix Petra's dress right away.

21:47.523 --> 21:50.091
Okay, I think this is
working. Yes.

21:51.440 --> 21:52.876
Why not? He wants to.

21:54.400 --> 21:55.444
It doesn't matter.

21:57.316 --> 21:58.839
No, it doesn't,
because it's my fault

21:58.882 --> 22:00.580
that we're in this situation
in the first place.

22:02.973 --> 22:06.107
If it wasn't for me and Montana

22:06.150 --> 22:07.804
and everything that happened,

22:07.848 --> 22:09.110
Raf and I would be
married by now.

22:09.153 --> 22:10.677
And he knows it and I know it,

22:10.720 --> 22:12.635
and I just want to move forward.

22:17.161 --> 22:18.772
Xiomara...

22:22.558 --> 22:24.865
I think everyone should be
able to do whatever they want.

22:24.908 --> 22:26.257
JANE:
Thank you, Ma.

22:26.867 --> 22:28.608
I'm not going to nursing school.What?!

22:37.747 --> 22:40.228
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: As you
recall, we last left Jane...

22:40.271 --> 22:44.319
: with her head stuck in a sewing machine.

22:44.363 --> 22:45.451
Ow!

22:45.494 --> 22:47.409
I'm sorry,
she's obviously in pain.

22:47.453 --> 22:49.585
That was totally inappropriate.

22:51.108 --> 22:52.936
No, no, no, I-I don't want
lopsided hair for the wedding.

22:58.464 --> 23:00.901
What do you mean you're not
applying to nursing school?

23:00.944 --> 23:03.425
I tried to sign up,
but there were words

23:03.469 --> 23:05.732
on the chemistry syllabus
I couldn't even pronounce.

23:05.775 --> 23:06.863
I don't know what
I was thinking.

23:06.907 --> 23:08.430
It was like
a foreign language.

23:10.476 --> 23:12.434
Yeah. I'll help you study

23:12.478 --> 23:14.697
and make flash cards,
and we could...

23:14.741 --> 23:17.918
Ma, I can't see you.Exactly.

23:17.961 --> 23:19.093
Abuela.Hmm?

23:19.136 --> 23:20.355
Move the machine.

23:20.399 --> 23:22.749
Ay.

23:27.710 --> 23:29.451
Look, I know it's gonna be hard,

23:29.495 --> 23:32.019
and it-- but... Abuela.

23:32.062 --> 23:34.587
Huh? Ay, dios mío.

23:34.630 --> 23:36.502
I don't want

23:36.545 --> 23:38.242
to talk about this anymore.

23:41.637 --> 23:44.466
You can't make my choices
for me. I'm an adult.

23:52.518 --> 23:54.911
She's not going to base
a lifelong decision

23:54.955 --> 23:57.000
on the result of a game, Abuela.

23:57.044 --> 23:58.262
Hmm.

24:01.265 --> 24:02.223
Wait, what?

24:02.266 --> 24:03.572
You don't understand.

24:03.616 --> 24:05.618
Only, like, one
in a hundred dancers make it

24:05.661 --> 24:07.837
to the second round of auditions
for Disney Cruises.

24:07.881 --> 24:10.013
And I'd get to be
Mrs. Potts' third teacup.

24:15.671 --> 24:18.500
I'm not dropping out.
I can take the GED next month.

24:19.675 --> 24:20.981
Dad, please.

24:21.024 --> 24:22.809
You've always believed in me.

24:32.035 --> 24:33.994
I win, I can go

24:34.037 --> 24:35.561
to the next round of auditions?

24:39.173 --> 24:40.696
Deal.

24:42.219 --> 24:43.873
Are you gonna cheat again?

24:49.400 --> 24:51.185
I'll get the game.

24:52.708 --> 24:55.668
What...? Hey. Um...

24:57.408 --> 24:59.367
Guys?

24:59.410 --> 25:01.064
I still need help.

25:05.199 --> 25:07.288
Are you sure you don't
want to get that checked?

25:07.331 --> 25:09.072
I have a great on-set doctor.

25:09.116 --> 25:11.335
She healed my chafing
with this amazing cream

25:11.379 --> 25:13.120
I rub right between...Dad,

25:13.163 --> 25:14.600
I-I-I'm fine.

25:14.643 --> 25:17.516
Just a little bit
stiff in the neck.

25:17.559 --> 25:19.822
I need you to shuffle
and call the cards.

25:19.866 --> 25:20.997
You're too honest to cheat.

25:21.041 --> 25:22.956
And watch your
grandma like a hawk.

25:22.999 --> 25:24.174
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
And so began

25:24.218 --> 25:25.741
the most epic Villanueva
lotería battle

25:25.785 --> 25:29.528
since their last epic
lotería battle.

25:38.754 --> 25:40.974
Okay, next card.LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
I'll go.

25:41.017 --> 25:43.237
"Who's always wearing
fancy shorts and is currently

25:43.280 --> 25:45.239
on the verge
of losing everything?"

25:47.981 --> 25:49.591
What do you want, Milos?

25:49.635 --> 25:51.288
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Revenge, conjugal visits,

25:51.332 --> 25:53.203
and a lockpick,
in no particular order.

25:53.247 --> 25:56.250
Just to say I outsmarted you.

25:56.293 --> 25:57.468
What are you talking about?

25:57.512 --> 25:59.166
Uh, you thought you could get

25:59.209 --> 26:02.517
my hotel shares back
if I'm convicted of a felony.

26:02.561 --> 26:06.129
But it's too late. I transfer
my shares to a close friend

26:06.173 --> 26:08.871
who will run the hotel
on my behalf.

26:08.915 --> 26:12.396
Game over, Petra.

26:12.440 --> 26:14.485
XIOMARA:
Yes. I am so close.

26:14.529 --> 26:17.576
I just need the pear
and the campana.

26:17.619 --> 26:19.665
Going through a
dry spell, Mom?

26:29.239 --> 26:31.198
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
And I have that one, too.

26:54.134 --> 26:55.526
I didn't need you
to run my life then,

26:55.570 --> 26:57.224
and I don't need you to now.

26:57.267 --> 26:58.878
Hurry up and flip another card.

26:58.921 --> 27:01.141
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Done, and it's my last one.

27:08.888 --> 27:10.454
What?

27:10.498 --> 27:12.543
No friendly hello
for the two-thirds owner

27:12.587 --> 27:13.806
of the Marbella?

27:16.156 --> 27:18.811
I can't believe he bought it!

27:18.854 --> 27:20.682
I know. The idiot
actually thought

27:20.726 --> 27:22.466
I would lie to get
him out of jail.

27:22.510 --> 27:24.643
He really thinks I hate
you-- which I used to,

27:24.686 --> 27:27.123
but now you pay me so damn much,
I think I might be in love.

27:27.167 --> 27:29.822
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
That's right, they were
in cahoots the whole time.

27:29.865 --> 27:31.214
I've already gotten the lawyers

27:31.258 --> 27:32.955
to draft up
the transfer paperwork.

27:32.999 --> 27:36.002
You will be the full owner
of the Marbella by tomorrow.

27:36.045 --> 27:38.004
Oh, and you will get
an annual bonus bigger

27:38.047 --> 27:39.701
than your previous
annual salary!

27:39.745 --> 27:41.355
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Yup.

27:41.398 --> 27:43.879
Played that cards down,
so to speak.

27:51.017 --> 27:53.323
Oh, yeah. That reminds me.

27:53.367 --> 27:56.500
We're down to the wire here.

27:56.544 --> 27:57.719
This is it.

27:57.763 --> 28:00.679
Abuela, you need el camarón
to win.

28:00.722 --> 28:03.856
Mom, it's all about the pear.

28:13.039 --> 28:15.215
Lotería!

28:15.258 --> 28:16.956
No way!

28:16.999 --> 28:18.609
Where is my pear?

28:19.480 --> 28:20.655
You must have cheated.

28:21.482 --> 28:23.049
Admit it.Okay, okay, okay.

28:23.092 --> 28:25.355
Both of you, relax.

28:25.399 --> 28:26.879
Dad!I'm sorry,

28:26.922 --> 28:28.968
it has a mind of its own!

28:29.011 --> 28:30.752
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR :
Cheateria.

28:30.796 --> 28:32.754
I knew it!

28:32.798 --> 28:34.408
You were supposed
to be watching her.

28:34.451 --> 28:36.105
I-I'm sorry, I don't have
a lot of mobility here,

28:36.149 --> 28:38.194
and I didn't think
she'd really cheat.

28:38.238 --> 28:40.066
XIOMARA:
Well, she did again.

28:40.109 --> 28:42.068
Because she always thinks
she knows what's best for me.

28:42.111 --> 28:44.287
This is exactly
like last time!

28:44.331 --> 28:46.289
Exactly!

28:46.333 --> 28:47.682
Why can't you just admit it?

28:47.726 --> 28:49.249
You cheated then,
and you cheated now.

28:54.080 --> 28:57.736
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Alas, Alba's final card.

28:57.779 --> 28:59.128
Lotería!

28:59.172 --> 29:01.478
You cheated.

29:01.522 --> 29:03.480
You've called all the cards
except the one I need.

29:03.524 --> 29:05.874
You took el barril,
didn't you, you cheater?

29:05.918 --> 29:08.572
Yes, you did!

29:08.616 --> 29:11.053
You cheated and I hate you.
I wish it was just me and Dad!

29:22.108 --> 29:23.892
I don't understand.

29:23.936 --> 29:25.894
Why would Dad do that?

29:25.938 --> 29:28.288
He was the one
who always believed in me.

29:45.871 --> 29:47.263
Unbelievable.

30:11.810 --> 30:13.507
Well, you were wrong.

30:13.550 --> 30:16.815
It does hurt. A lot.

30:26.128 --> 30:29.436
NARRATOR:
♪ Here comes the bride,
all black and blue.♪

30:29.479 --> 30:31.438
If the cleaners can't get the
stain out, it's fine, Abuela.

30:31.481 --> 30:32.831
I'll just wear the dress
I wore to Easter.

30:34.441 --> 30:36.095
Well, I don't think it's basic,

30:36.138 --> 30:38.619
and-and it's the closest thing
I have to a wedding dress.

30:40.186 --> 30:41.622
Hiya, Jane!

30:41.665 --> 30:43.232
And, good Lord,
what happened to you?

30:43.276 --> 30:45.321
Oh, I got into a fight
with a sewing machine.

30:45.365 --> 30:46.757
Aren't you supposed
to be getting married

30:46.801 --> 30:47.933
in a couple hours?Yes.

30:47.976 --> 30:49.630
That's why I'm here.

30:49.673 --> 30:51.632
Here's your dress
for the wedding.

30:53.982 --> 30:55.941
Wow. Why would you
bring me this...

30:55.984 --> 30:58.117
monstrosity?

30:58.160 --> 31:00.815
You said you wanted to
be my maid of honor.

31:00.859 --> 31:02.469
Y-You said that
your feelings were hurt,

31:02.512 --> 31:04.471
that you'd never been
in a wedding before,

31:04.514 --> 31:06.908
that it would mean
the world to you...

31:06.952 --> 31:09.171
Oh, that! Oh, sorry.

31:09.215 --> 31:10.433
I-I wasn't really
upset about that.

31:10.477 --> 31:12.348
I just needed to get you
out of my office.

31:12.392 --> 31:13.959
'Cause we thought Milos might
have bugged it, and you kept

31:14.002 --> 31:16.091
going on about whether I had
a plan to thwart him.

31:16.135 --> 31:17.919
Which of course I did, but
I couldn't let him know that.

31:17.963 --> 31:19.747
Anyway, plan worked,
I got the hotel back

31:19.790 --> 31:20.966
and I couldn't be happier!

31:21.009 --> 31:22.402
Seriously?

31:22.445 --> 31:24.186
Yes, I know, exciting, right?

31:24.230 --> 31:27.102
Petra, I put my blood,
sweat and tears

31:27.146 --> 31:29.800
into this dress, literally,
to make you feel better

31:29.844 --> 31:32.368
a-and now you're telling me that
you didn't actually give a crap?

31:32.412 --> 31:34.762
O-Okay, well, I-I didn't...Yeah, you didn't.

31:34.805 --> 31:36.938
And now because of you,
I have to get married

31:36.982 --> 31:38.461
looking like Quasimodo.

31:40.246 --> 31:41.421
Jane...Whatever.

31:41.464 --> 31:42.944
It's just a small,
quickie wedding.

31:42.988 --> 31:44.990
I shouldn't even have a
freaking maid of honor anyway.

31:45.033 --> 31:47.383
Just show up at the
courthouse at 5:00 p.m.

31:47.427 --> 31:49.559
XIOMARA:
Can you believe her?

31:49.603 --> 31:52.171
She is still
cheating and lying to try

31:52.214 --> 31:54.129
and control my life.
I'm a grown woman.

31:54.173 --> 31:56.479
Becoming a nurse
or not is my choice

31:56.523 --> 31:58.612
and my mom
has no right to interfere.

31:58.655 --> 32:00.396
Okay.

32:00.440 --> 32:02.094
This is the part
where you say, "I know,

32:02.137 --> 32:03.704
she's the worst.
I'm on your side."

32:03.747 --> 32:05.836
Xiomara...Oh, my God.

32:05.880 --> 32:07.142
You're on her side?

32:07.186 --> 32:08.752
No. Yours, always.

32:08.796 --> 32:10.319
Because we are a team.

32:10.363 --> 32:12.365
I just think if this
is something you want,

32:12.408 --> 32:14.933
it's a little strange
you're not even trying.

32:14.976 --> 32:16.369
I did try.

32:16.412 --> 32:18.023
For five minutes.

32:18.066 --> 32:21.069
Then it felt hard,
so you quit.

32:21.113 --> 32:22.549
Which is...

32:22.592 --> 32:24.725
well, it's...
insulting, frankly.

32:24.768 --> 32:26.422
"Insulting"?Yes.

32:26.466 --> 32:28.163
You know how hard
I've been working

32:28.207 --> 32:30.426
to make my
dream come true.

32:30.470 --> 32:32.689
I've been wearing a
tail, for God's sake.

32:32.733 --> 32:34.082
In public.

32:34.126 --> 32:36.432
I've scared children,
knocked over tables

32:36.476 --> 32:40.045
and made many gentlemen
uncomfortable at the urinal.

32:40.088 --> 32:41.742
Okay, I think
we're getting off-topic.

32:41.785 --> 32:43.874
No, we're not. I'm doing
whatever needs to be done.

32:43.918 --> 32:45.615
No matter how hard it is.

32:45.659 --> 32:48.009
And you just quit before
you even got started.

32:48.053 --> 32:51.012
Dreams don't come easy.
You have to work for them.

32:51.056 --> 32:53.841
So, if nursing is what
you really want to do,

32:53.884 --> 32:56.800
then it's time you put
your big girl pants on,

32:56.844 --> 32:59.368
strap on that tail
and work for it.

32:59.412 --> 33:00.891
You know what?What?

33:00.935 --> 33:03.285
You're right.

33:03.329 --> 33:05.679
You're right.

33:07.072 --> 33:08.899
JANE:
I can't believe it worked.

33:08.943 --> 33:10.945
You can hardly tell
I have a black eye.

33:17.778 --> 33:19.432
Oh, I'll take it off
for the ceremony.

33:19.475 --> 33:21.390
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
And put it on
for the honeymoon.

33:21.434 --> 33:23.914
Am I right?XIOMARA: Sorry
I'm late, sweetie.

33:23.958 --> 33:25.394
You look beautiful.

33:25.438 --> 33:27.309
Ma.
Considering.

33:27.353 --> 33:29.137
Thank you.
But...

33:29.181 --> 33:31.748
you don't look very happy.Of course I'm happy.

33:31.792 --> 33:33.272
I'm about
to get married.

33:37.624 --> 33:39.408
Janie, is this true?

33:39.452 --> 33:41.149
I just...

33:41.193 --> 33:43.760
don't want a rushed,
small courthouse wedding.

33:43.804 --> 33:45.327
Then why on earth
don't you tell him?

33:45.371 --> 33:47.416
Because I've already
put him through the wringer--

33:47.460 --> 33:49.592
going to Montana,
breaking up our family.

33:49.636 --> 33:51.420
If he wants this wedding
right now,

33:51.464 --> 33:53.118
then he should have it.

33:53.161 --> 33:55.946
Sweetie, come on. You can't
go into marriage this way.

33:55.990 --> 33:57.426
It's like your
abuelasaid.

33:57.470 --> 34:00.647
Husbands and wives
have to be a team.

34:13.312 --> 34:14.704
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Which brings us to...

34:14.748 --> 34:17.011
Oh, wow.

34:17.055 --> 34:18.882
You actually wore it.

34:18.926 --> 34:20.710
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Where is she?

34:20.754 --> 34:22.930
She's getting ready
at her grandma's house.Gotcha.

34:24.366 --> 34:26.064
So you're really
getting married tonight?

34:26.107 --> 34:28.109
What does that mean?

34:28.153 --> 34:30.590
It means...

34:30.633 --> 34:32.070
well, have you
seen Jane's face?

34:32.113 --> 34:33.375
She said she's fine.

34:33.419 --> 34:35.160
She's not.
She's miserable.

34:35.203 --> 34:37.118
Why are you in such a
rush to get married?

34:37.162 --> 34:38.728
Well, you know.

34:38.772 --> 34:40.687
Got to lock it down.

34:41.731 --> 34:44.691
I'm kidding.
Are you?

34:49.261 --> 34:52.307
I guess a part of me feels like
something might happen...

34:52.351 --> 34:54.701
and she'll
change her mind again.

34:54.744 --> 34:57.834
Look... I know what happened

34:57.878 --> 35:00.750
with Michael was... devastating.

35:01.838 --> 35:03.927
But you have to be
able to get over that,

35:03.971 --> 35:05.407
and trust her again,

35:05.451 --> 35:07.322
because if you don't...

35:09.107 --> 35:10.891
Look at me and J.R.

35:10.934 --> 35:12.675
She thought she could
get over the past.

35:12.719 --> 35:15.461
In the end, she
just couldn't.

35:15.504 --> 35:17.027
Can you?

35:18.072 --> 35:19.900
I don't know.

35:25.514 --> 35:27.821
Just talk to her, okay?

35:27.864 --> 35:30.432
JANE:
Hey, there.

35:31.781 --> 35:34.001
Y-You know what? I've,
I've been meaning

35:34.044 --> 35:35.394
to spend some quality
time with Mateo.

35:35.437 --> 35:37.352
So, um, I'll just
be right inside.

35:42.966 --> 35:44.359
So, I...
I don't...

35:44.403 --> 35:46.405
Oh. You, go ahead.

35:46.448 --> 35:50.409
I don't want
to get married today.

35:50.452 --> 35:52.715
Oh, thank God. Me neither.

35:52.759 --> 35:53.934
I want to wait

35:53.977 --> 35:55.675
and plan something
really wonderful and--

35:55.718 --> 35:57.981
What's wrong?

35:58.982 --> 36:01.159
I don't know if I trust you.

36:01.202 --> 36:03.248
Because of Michael?

36:03.291 --> 36:05.641
What if you
change your mind again?I won't.

36:05.685 --> 36:08.166
You just did.I didn't
change my mind.

36:08.209 --> 36:09.645
My husband came back
from the dead.

36:09.689 --> 36:11.517
It's an impossible,
crazy situation.

36:11.560 --> 36:13.345
What else could I have done?

36:13.388 --> 36:15.173
Chosen me.

36:15.216 --> 36:17.610
Right then. Told him to leave.I couldn't have.

36:17.653 --> 36:19.568
I mean, maybe somebody else
in that situation could have,

36:19.612 --> 36:23.137
but you know me, Rafael.
You said it yourself.

36:23.181 --> 36:25.095
I had to explore
things with him,

36:25.139 --> 36:27.968
he was my...
husband.

36:28.011 --> 36:30.492
And I can't feel guilty
about that forever.

36:30.536 --> 36:32.494
I'm not trying
to make you feel guilty.

36:32.538 --> 36:34.366
I'm just...

36:36.194 --> 36:37.630
scared.

36:40.154 --> 36:42.504
Yeah... okay.

36:42.548 --> 36:45.942
A-And maybe it'll take time
for you to trust this.

36:45.986 --> 36:47.727
But I want you to
know that I want

36:47.770 --> 36:50.556
to marry you and spend
my life with you.

36:50.599 --> 36:52.384
Because I chose you,
Rafael, and I will

36:52.427 --> 36:53.950
keep choosing you,

36:53.994 --> 36:56.257
every single day
for the rest of our lives.

36:56.301 --> 36:58.303
I'm serious.

36:58.346 --> 37:00.783
If you ever try to leave me,
I'm going with you.

37:00.827 --> 37:03.525
Yeah?

37:03.569 --> 37:05.788
Yeah.

37:05.832 --> 37:08.878
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Aw. Turns out,
sometimes you need the vows

37:08.922 --> 37:11.707
before the wedding.

37:13.231 --> 37:14.710
My neck's still
pretty stiff, um...

37:14.754 --> 37:16.756
Maybe you should go in
the other way.

37:17.757 --> 37:19.802
Ah! Ow, ow. Mm.

37:19.846 --> 37:22.240
Maybe bend your head

37:22.283 --> 37:23.545
a little more
to the right

37:23.589 --> 37:26.461
and no face grab.

37:26.505 --> 37:29.072
Got it.

37:31.945 --> 37:34.469
Jane and Rafael
pushed the wedding.

37:34.513 --> 37:37.255
They want to plan a real
celebration in a few months.

37:39.953 --> 37:42.129
And speaking of right...

37:44.349 --> 37:47.482
I do... want to go
to nursing school.

37:47.526 --> 37:50.268
I'm just...

37:50.311 --> 37:52.052
Yeah.

37:52.095 --> 37:53.401
There's so much
science stuff

37:53.445 --> 37:55.229
I don't know
or understand...

38:11.463 --> 38:13.334
Not every minute,
right?

38:13.378 --> 38:15.031
'Cause I-I'm gonna need
study breaks.

38:27.392 --> 38:29.045
It's crazy,
I spent my whole life

38:29.089 --> 38:30.482
trying to be
the opposite of you

38:30.525 --> 38:32.788
and now...

38:32.832 --> 38:35.269
I'm stepping into
your nursing shoes.

38:41.275 --> 38:43.538
ROGELIO:
I did it.

38:43.582 --> 38:47.194
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Spoiler alert:
he really did nail that tail.

38:55.550 --> 38:57.204
That's crazy.

38:57.247 --> 38:58.901
NARRATOR:
I know, I'm sorry.
I just had to show you.

38:58.945 --> 39:00.468
150 people?

39:00.512 --> 39:02.514
We definitely wouldn't
be able to do it at the court.

39:02.557 --> 39:04.211
That's okay.

39:04.254 --> 39:06.474
It's more important to have
everyone we know and love there.

39:06.518 --> 39:09.303
Yeah.
Mm? Mm.

39:09.347 --> 39:12.088
You guys about done?
'Cause I need to talk to Jane.

39:12.132 --> 39:13.394
And quite frankly,
Mateo and I have reached

39:13.438 --> 39:14.613
our conversational limit.

39:15.962 --> 39:17.746
Wow.

39:17.790 --> 39:19.444
That dress just hurts the eyes.

39:19.487 --> 39:22.316
Okay, I'm only wearing it
so that Jane knows I'm sorry.

39:22.360 --> 39:25.406
I... didn't mean to make
you feel like a fool.

39:25.450 --> 39:27.669
I should have told you what
was going on with Milos.

39:27.713 --> 39:29.105
But look,

39:29.149 --> 39:30.803
I'm a more selfish
person than you,

39:30.846 --> 39:32.413
so sometimes I forget to
think about other people,

39:32.457 --> 39:34.154
but I'm working
on it, okay?

39:34.197 --> 39:36.286
Okay.But hey,

39:36.330 --> 39:39.202
it is who I am, so don't expect,
like, a huge change.

39:39.246 --> 39:41.117
Well, I appreciate
your honesty.

39:41.161 --> 39:42.728
And I love you, Petra.

39:42.771 --> 39:44.556
Which is why, now that
we're postponing the wedding

39:44.599 --> 39:46.384
and going bigger,

39:46.427 --> 39:48.864
I really do want you
by my side at the wedding.

39:49.735 --> 39:51.214
Not so fast.

39:52.346 --> 39:53.652
See, I've also been
thinking about

39:53.695 --> 39:56.437
who I want by my side
at our wedding.

39:56.481 --> 39:58.831
And I was also
going to ask Petra.

39:58.874 --> 40:02.008
But...
I just asked her.

40:02.051 --> 40:03.488
Well, I knew her first.

40:03.531 --> 40:06.142
Oh, I know her better.I was married to her.

40:06.186 --> 40:07.666
A long time ago.Did you know

40:07.709 --> 40:09.581
that she has a fear of
drive-through car washes?

40:09.624 --> 40:12.279
Did you know that
she and I are on the same cycle?

40:13.715 --> 40:15.413
I did not.Mm.

40:15.456 --> 40:17.632
Did you know that
she refuses to see a movie

40:17.676 --> 40:19.025
if she knows an animal dies?

40:19.068 --> 40:20.635
Uh, but I don't mind
if people die.

40:20.679 --> 40:22.115
Did you know that
she knows every single word

40:22.158 --> 40:23.246
to Justin Bieber's
"Love Yourself"?

40:23.290 --> 40:24.378
Okay. Oh, that's...

40:24.422 --> 40:26.511
enough spilling of secrets.Please.

40:26.554 --> 40:28.817
Look, I don't have
anyone else on my side.

40:28.861 --> 40:31.646
You have your mom and your
grandma and your dad.

40:31.690 --> 40:34.519
I used to have Luisa,
but not anymore.

40:34.562 --> 40:38.000
I know what it's like
to feel abandoned.

40:38.044 --> 40:40.046
And through it all,
Petra has been

40:40.089 --> 40:42.440
a constant in my life,
for better or worse.

40:42.483 --> 40:44.529
I really want her
by my side for this.

40:46.052 --> 40:48.054
Ugh, okay. Fine.

40:48.097 --> 40:50.752
So it's settled.Oh...

40:50.796 --> 40:52.972
I'll be Rafael's best man.Mm-hmm.

40:55.017 --> 40:57.629
And Mateo could be
the ring bearer.Oh...

40:57.672 --> 40:59.674
Oh, my God.

40:59.718 --> 41:01.937
We forgot about Mateo.Oh.

41:01.981 --> 41:04.070
How are we gonna tell him
that we're postponing again?

41:04.113 --> 41:05.245
W-We can't.

41:12.557 --> 41:14.515
Daddy, do you promise
to never ever

41:14.559 --> 41:16.474
break up with Mommy again?

41:16.517 --> 41:19.477
Yes... I do.

41:19.520 --> 41:22.392
And Mommy, do you promise
to never move back

41:22.436 --> 41:24.394
to Bisa's house
again, even when

41:24.438 --> 41:26.222
Daddy's really mad
at you?

41:26.266 --> 41:29.008
I promise.Yeah! You're married.

41:29.051 --> 41:31.880
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Aw. If only the real wedding
could go this smoothly.

41:31.924 --> 41:35.884
But alas, that's...
not in the cards.
