- Hello.

00:02.719 --> 00:04.312
- What's wrong with you?
- I let him out of his cage,

00:04.382 --> 00:06.317
and he helped me get out of mine.

00:06.379 --> 00:08.562
- You're him, the Riddler.
- Hi, Lee.

Butch?

You're alive.

Oh, Butch, I tried.

GILZEAN: Tabby, I'm gonna find a way

GORDON: Tell me
about your mother, Jerome.

00:23.370 --> 00:24.314
Did she have any enemies?

00:24.339 --> 00:26.172
- No.
- Do you have any other family?

00:26.275 --> 00:28.241
The circus is my family.

JEROME: Now, to free

00:30.646 --> 00:32.879

BRUCE: I could have killed
Jerome after he kidnapped me

00:35.017 --> 00:36.249
and I didn't.

00:36.351 --> 00:38.685
Any harm he does now,
I share a part of it.

00:38.787 --> 00:40.520
I saw Jerome tonight.

00:40.622 --> 00:42.722
He was looking for the name of
a school, St. Ignatius.

00:42.824 --> 00:44.257
Stay the hell away from that madman.

I'll see you at St. Ignatius, Jim.

I didn't have the pleasure

Fine young boy, very bright.

08:44.522 --> 08:46.188
Hey, Jim. Same story all around.

08:46.223 --> 08:47.995
No one knows Xander;
no one even met him.

08:48.058 --> 08:49.757
Apparently, he had a proxy

08:49.793 --> 08:52.026
who handled his, uh,
dealings with the company.

08:52.062 --> 08:54.762
Hayes was the only one
who knew their identity,

08:54.798 --> 08:58.344
but, uh, obviously, he's not talking.

08:58.423 --> 09:01.391
So we have to figure out
another way to find Xander.

09:01.426 --> 09:03.359
I'm ahead of you. We looked into it.

09:03.395 --> 09:04.928

Jerome finding this guy.

09:13.071 --> 09:14.871
I don't think it has anything to
do with him being an engineer.

09:14.906 --> 09:16.973
- This seems personal.
- Makes sense.

09:17.008 --> 09:19.698
I mean, Jerome went to his uncle
to look for him.

09:19.745 --> 09:21.377
Yeah. So how are they connected?

09:22.948 --> 09:24.114
What's up?

09:25.650 --> 09:27.383
Is that Wayne Plaza?

09:27.419 --> 09:29.619
GORDON: Take a look at
the initials of the engineer.

09:31.128 --> 09:33.423

- Uh-huh.

09:33.458 --> 09:36.559
Looks like we're gonna have
to go talk to the kid.

09:36.595 --> 09:39.562

11:56.134 --> 11:57.333
(scattered laughter)

12:01.139 --> 12:02.605
(buzzer sounds)

12:02.641 --> 12:04.238
(crowd groans)

12:04.263 --> 12:07.910
The answer is ton. T-O-N.

12:07.946 --> 12:11.481
Backwards, I am "not."

12:11.516 --> 12:14.050
Sorry, Lars.

12:16.921 --> 12:20.323
Spin the wheel! Spin the wheel!

12:20.358 --> 12:24.227
Spin the wheel! Spin the wheel!

12:24.262 --> 12:26.095
You hear 'em, Lars.

12:26.131 --> 12:28.598
It's time to spin...

12:28.633 --> 12:32.768
ALL: The Wheel of Misfortune.

12:33.905 --> 12:35.605
ALL: Spin the wheel!

12:35.640 --> 12:38.207
Spin the wheel! Spin the wheel!

12:38.243 --> 12:40.410
- Lila, please.
- (chanting continues)

12:40.445 --> 12:43.513
Spin the wheel! Spin the wheel!

12:43.548 --> 12:46.749
Spin the wheel! Spin the wheel!

12:46.785 --> 12:48.951
Spin the wheel! Spin the wheel!

12:48.987 --> 12:50.453
(bell ringing)

12:50.488 --> 12:51.954
(crowd cheering)

12:51.990 --> 12:53.890
My personal favorite.

12:53.925 --> 12:55.992
Rabid Sack of Rats!

12:56.027 --> 12:58.261
(cheering)

12:58.296 --> 13:01.097
- (laughing)
- (rats squeaking)

13:01.132 --> 13:03.966
THOMPKINS: All right,
that's enough! Enough!

13:06.484 --> 13:08.512
NYGMA: Doc Thompkins.

13:08.559 --> 13:11.465
What brings Your Majesty down
to our rabble?

13:11.517 --> 13:13.247
How you doing, Ed?

13:13.309 --> 13:16.606
Haven't seen you
since we put Oswald on ice.

13:16.648 --> 13:19.048
Well, I'm doing far better
than Sofia Falcone,

13:19.121 --> 13:20.750
from what I understand.

13:20.785 --> 13:23.738
Whatever the hell this is, it's over.

13:24.308 --> 13:28.324
I don't think so. Ladies and gentlemen,

13:28.840 --> 13:33.117
our queen has just informed me
she wants to shut us down.

13:33.180 --> 13:34.170
How do you feel about that?

13:34.199 --> 13:36.966
(crowd booing and shouting)

13:40.766 --> 13:42.360
You hear that?

13:42.947 --> 13:44.939
That's the sound of democracy.

13:44.986 --> 13:48.181
The people have spoken.

13:48.845 --> 13:53.049
And my name is the Riddler.

13:55.091 --> 13:56.917
Okay.

14:00.125 --> 14:02.291
You want to be entertained?

14:02.327 --> 14:03.626
Hold this, will you?

14:06.964 --> 14:08.865
- Then I'll beat him.
- MAN: Oh!

14:09.862 --> 14:11.534
You can't be serious.

14:11.995 --> 14:13.503
You realize what happens

14:13.538 --> 14:15.471
- when you lose?
- I know.

14:15.507 --> 14:17.340
I spin the wheel.

14:17.375 --> 14:20.372
But if I win, you shut this place down.

14:20.419 --> 14:22.245
(crowd shouting)

14:22.280 --> 14:25.581
ALL (chanting):
Doc, Doc, Doc, Doc, Doc...

14:25.617 --> 14:28.284
(man booing)

14:28.319 --> 14:30.987
We have our next contestant!

14:31.022 --> 14:33.222
(cheering)

14:51.443 --> 14:53.810
JEROME: Got any ice cream in there?

14:57.081 --> 15:01.050
I've always had a soft
spot for Chunky Monkey.

15:01.085 --> 15:03.553
I was wondering when you would come.

15:03.588 --> 15:06.856
Me? That's very flattering.

15:07.313 --> 15:10.699
So tell me, Little Miss Proxy,

15:10.753 --> 15:12.277
where is he?

15:13.121 --> 15:15.087
I'll never tell you.

15:17.469 --> 15:21.037
Hmm. I don't know.

15:22.807 --> 15:24.699
See...

15:24.809 --> 15:27.543
I can be very persuasive.

15:28.813 --> 15:31.210
See that?

15:32.050 --> 15:34.283
JEROME: Yeah.
I was wondering about that.

15:34.311 --> 15:37.745
You got, like, a big dog or something?

15:37.789 --> 15:41.390
No. That's how
I'm going to transport you.

15:41.426 --> 15:42.859
Hmm?

15:48.733 --> 15:49.799
(phone beeps)

15:51.836 --> 15:53.803
I've got him.

15:59.065 --> 16:02.182
(horn blows)

16:02.238 --> 16:04.606
(glass clinking)

16:12.394 --> 16:14.261
Butch?

16:24.561 --> 16:27.019
I had heard you were different.

16:27.106 --> 16:29.707
But I will be honest.

16:29.742 --> 16:31.776
I like it.

16:32.816 --> 16:35.622
What do you want?

16:36.114 --> 16:38.747
I assume you've heard
about the Arkham breakout.

16:39.794 --> 16:40.860
Well,

16:40.920 --> 16:45.589
I just came from brunch
with Jerome Valeska,

16:45.625 --> 16:49.193
and let's just say
that he has plans for Gotham.

16:49.797 --> 16:52.096
What kind of plans?

16:52.765 --> 16:55.375
That part wasn't entirely clear.

16:55.453 --> 16:58.369
They seem to involve a great
deal of paint. (laughs)

16:58.404 --> 16:59.870
No matter.

16:59.906 --> 17:02.306
I have seen his kind come and go.

17:02.341 --> 17:04.441
Jerome Valeska will flame out.

17:04.477 --> 17:06.777
And in the rubble,

17:06.813 --> 17:09.280
I will reclaim the underworld.

17:12.291 --> 17:14.400
I could use a good man
like you by my side.

17:14.425 --> 17:15.564
(chuckles)

17:15.627 --> 17:19.007
You must be all out of allies
to come looking for me.

17:19.069 --> 17:20.146
Don't be modest.

17:20.171 --> 17:23.730
With your brute strength and my
brains, we will be unstoppable.

17:23.765 --> 17:26.566
I did that job. I'm my own man now.

17:26.601 --> 17:28.101
(laughs)

17:28.136 --> 17:30.737
Really?

17:30.772 --> 17:34.761
Because from where I am, you
look like a man who has nothing.

17:34.800 --> 17:36.910
You'd be wise
to watch what you say to me.

17:36.945 --> 17:40.180
- I'm not the same man you remember.
- And neither am I.

17:40.215 --> 17:42.550
Look at the two of us.

17:42.589 --> 17:45.261
We used to run this town together.

17:45.312 --> 17:47.073
We were friends.

17:47.120 --> 17:49.522
Look, you want your old
life back. So do I.

17:50.245 --> 17:51.898
- We are the same.
- Wrong!

17:51.927 --> 17:53.893
- (groaning)
- You can have your old life back.

17:53.929 --> 17:55.795
I can't. Look at me.

17:55.831 --> 17:57.897
Tabitha will never love me again.

17:57.925 --> 18:00.892
Slaughter Swamp turned
me into a monster!

18:02.004 --> 18:03.636
Now get out of here.

18:03.672 --> 18:05.672
If I ever see you again,

18:05.707 --> 18:07.841
I'll pop your head off like a flower.

18:07.876 --> 18:10.777
(coughs)

18:10.812 --> 18:13.813
(birds chirping)

18:13.849 --> 18:15.181
Let me get this straight.

18:15.217 --> 18:16.916
You tell us to stay out
of your investigation,

18:16.952 --> 18:18.484
and now you want our help?

18:18.520 --> 18:20.520
- Subtle.
- We have reason to believe

18:20.555 --> 18:22.422
your father met with Xander Wilde.

18:22.457 --> 18:24.257
Well, if he did, he certainly
would have made a note of it.

18:24.292 --> 18:25.692
What was the name of the building again?

18:25.727 --> 18:27.743
Wayne Plaza.

18:27.813 --> 18:30.196
He was a meticulous notetaker, Thomas.

18:30.232 --> 18:32.498
He organized everything by project.

18:32.534 --> 18:34.500
Let's see. Wayne Gardens.

18:34.536 --> 18:36.336
Wayne Hospital.

18:36.371 --> 18:39.005
Aha. Here we go.

18:39.040 --> 18:40.907
Wayne Plaza.

18:43.954 --> 18:45.366
Right.

18:47.944 --> 18:50.116
Oh, you're bang
on the money there, Captain.

18:50.151 --> 18:53.419
Xander Wilde. Says he went to
meet him to finalize the plans.

18:53.455 --> 18:56.456
No address, just the name of
the street... Annesley Drive.

18:56.491 --> 18:59.359
That's out past Buxton
by the old rock quarry.

18:59.394 --> 19:01.394
This man must have been
very important if my father

19:01.429 --> 19:04.063
went out of his way to meet him alone.

19:04.099 --> 19:05.865
I'm starting to think he
isn't just some recluse

19:05.901 --> 19:07.300
hiding from the world.

19:07.335 --> 19:09.135
He's hiding from Jerome.

19:30.458 --> 19:32.825
(laughing)

19:35.325 --> 19:37.597
How interesting.

19:41.036 --> 19:43.469
(grunting)

19:45.540 --> 19:47.674
(grunts)

19:50.501 --> 19:52.067
Oh.

19:52.137 --> 19:54.814
- Oh, you are incorrigible.
- (camera whirring)

19:55.223 --> 19:57.150
And then again,

19:57.185 --> 19:58.685
you always were.

19:58.720 --> 20:00.453
(laughs)

20:01.050 --> 20:03.484
Oh, wait. Or was that me?

20:03.564 --> 20:05.024
Sometimes I get so confused,

20:05.060 --> 20:07.861
I... I can't remember.

20:08.930 --> 20:11.331
(laughing)

20:11.366 --> 20:13.199
(sighs)

20:13.234 --> 20:16.693
<i>You didn't have
to run away like that, you see.</i>

20:16.805 --> 20:21.449
<i>I would never hurt you... Xander.</i>

20:22.098 --> 20:24.231
<i>I love you.</i>

20:24.270 --> 20:26.312
(laughing)

20:26.348 --> 20:29.882
(cackling continues)

20:29.918 --> 20:32.234
<i>Can't wait to see ya!</i>

20:32.259 --> 20:33.519
<i>Did you think about me?</i>

20:33.555 --> 20:35.521
<i>I know that you did.</i>

20:35.557 --> 20:38.095
<i>Oh, I'm gonna squeeze you until you pop!</i>

20:58.064 --> 20:59.746
BULLOCK: Where the hell's the house?

21:13.028 --> 21:14.727
(buzzer sounds)

21:16.564 --> 21:18.097
James Gordon,

21:18.133 --> 21:20.500
<i>here to see Xander Wilde.</i>

21:23.438 --> 21:25.238
(lock clicks)

21:38.953 --> 21:41.521
So this whole joint's underground?

21:41.556 --> 21:43.723
Mr. Wilde values his privacy.

21:43.758 --> 21:45.425
How long has he lived here?

21:45.460 --> 21:47.860
He finished construction six years ago.

21:49.764 --> 21:50.997
(camera whirring)

21:55.779 --> 21:58.404
- Ecco. 496.
- FEMALE VOICE: <i>Welcome, Ms. Ecco.</i>

21:58.440 --> 22:00.073
He'll see you now.

22:09.330 --> 22:11.564
Thank you for seeing us, Mr. Wilde.

22:14.886 --> 22:16.856
I expected you might come, Captain.

22:17.892 --> 22:18.958
BULLOCK: My God.

22:20.865 --> 22:22.826
There's two of them.

22:34.665 --> 22:37.679
May I put my hands down now, gentlemen?

22:37.722 --> 22:39.062
Please?

22:39.123 --> 22:42.959
Apologies, Mr. Wilde.
You took us by surprise.

22:43.386 --> 22:45.319
That's understandable.

22:45.355 --> 22:47.521
You can call me Jeremiah.

22:47.557 --> 22:49.907
That's the name my mother gave me.

22:50.462 --> 22:52.329
You solved her murder, Captain Gordon.

22:52.364 --> 22:54.631
I owe you a debt of gratitude for that

22:54.666 --> 22:58.404
and for putting Jerome
in Arkham, where he belongs.

23:00.052 --> 23:02.357
He never mentioned you before.

23:03.726 --> 23:06.493
No, I suppose he wouldn't have.

23:06.545 --> 23:07.877
From the letters my mother sent me,

23:07.913 --> 23:10.080
he never spoke of me after I left.

23:10.115 --> 23:12.282
Left where?

23:13.496 --> 23:15.476
The circus.

23:15.554 --> 23:17.921
They hid me away to protect me from him.

23:18.391 --> 23:22.158
See, we were always different,
Jerome and I.

23:22.194 --> 23:23.893
From an early age,
I showed a proficiency

23:23.929 --> 23:25.495
for maths and design,

23:25.530 --> 23:27.831
and Jerome, mainly
the mutilation of alley cats.

23:27.866 --> 23:30.967
On my tenth birthday, he held
a cake knife to my throat.

23:31.003 --> 23:33.261
A few weeks later,
he lit my bed on fire.

23:33.308 --> 23:35.572
It was like living in a nightmare.

23:35.607 --> 23:38.708
My mother knew eventually
one day he would succeed,

23:38.788 --> 23:42.579
so one night, my uncle came
to my room while Jerome slept,

23:43.249 --> 23:45.081
and told me that he was taking me away.

23:45.117 --> 23:47.217
I had no idea where,

23:47.738 --> 23:50.887
but I kissed my mother good-bye,

23:50.922 --> 23:52.355
told her I loved her,

23:52.391 --> 23:56.026
and I never saw her again.

23:56.472 --> 23:58.480
He took you to St. Ignatius.

23:59.241 --> 24:01.784
Got a new name, a new life.

24:01.933 --> 24:04.534
And I was finally able
to live without fear.

24:04.569 --> 24:07.537
But in my heart,

24:07.572 --> 24:10.140
I knew one day Jerome would come for me.

24:10.175 --> 24:12.976
Well, that day is today, pops.

24:13.011 --> 24:15.879
We have reason to believe
Jerome knows where you are.

24:15.914 --> 24:17.747
We need to move you to a safe location

24:17.783 --> 24:20.157
- until we can apprehend him.
- That won't be necessary, gentlemen.

24:20.212 --> 24:22.752
I've spent the bulk of my life
preparing for this eventuality.

24:22.788 --> 24:25.422
I am safest here in my home.

24:25.457 --> 24:26.656
Not anymore.

24:26.691 --> 24:28.925
Jerome knows the name of your proxy.

24:28.960 --> 24:31.321
He got it from your boss
just before he executed him.

24:31.454 --> 24:33.763
I heard about Jerome
visiting Allen Hayes.

24:33.799 --> 24:35.899
It's tragic.

24:35.934 --> 24:39.903
But the proxy's name
I gave to Allen was a fake.

24:45.803 --> 24:47.669
You're lying.

24:48.368 --> 24:50.180
I beg your pardon?

24:51.694 --> 24:54.413
Yeah, there's something
about this guy that's fishy.

24:56.170 --> 24:58.798
The security cameras outside.

24:58.857 --> 25:00.123
They were turned on.

25:00.158 --> 25:02.192
So why are the monitors in here off?

25:02.227 --> 25:04.616
I don't see why
that's any of your concern.

25:04.663 --> 25:06.577
Now, if you excuse me,
I'm a very busy man.

25:06.602 --> 25:09.110
- Yeah. I'm sure that you are.
- Please don't touch that.

25:09.171 --> 25:10.934
That's very sensitive equipment.

25:14.906 --> 25:17.173
(Jerome grunting)

25:29.521 --> 25:31.121
BULLOCK: Oh, yeah.

25:31.156 --> 25:33.957
I'd say that's pretty damn sensitive.

25:36.194 --> 25:37.794
Ladies and gentlemen,

25:37.840 --> 25:40.407
a gauntlet has been laid
at the Riddler's feet.

25:40.755 --> 25:43.896
Our leader, Doc Thompkins...

25:43.990 --> 25:46.629
she thinks that she knows
what's good for you.

25:46.654 --> 25:48.966
She thinks stapling a live barracuda

25:49.013 --> 25:51.674
to someone's face isn't
damn good entertainment.

25:51.710 --> 25:53.643
(crowd booing)

25:55.380 --> 25:56.713
- Just get on with the show, Ed.
- Okay.

25:56.748 --> 25:58.848
Enough! What time is it?

25:58.884 --> 26:00.216
CROWD: Riddle time!

26:00.241 --> 26:02.574
- What time is it?
- Riddle time!

26:02.621 --> 26:05.255
- Lila.
- (crowd cheering)

26:06.391 --> 26:08.358
Prepare the timer.

26:10.193 --> 26:12.510
WOMAN: Let's go, Lee!

26:13.732 --> 26:15.899
I can be broken...

26:16.674 --> 26:18.034
without being held.

26:18.120 --> 26:21.037
Given and then taken away.

26:21.072 --> 26:23.573
Some people use me to deceive,

26:23.784 --> 26:27.501
but when delivered,
I am the greatest gift of all.

26:27.546 --> 26:29.851
What am I?

26:52.911 --> 26:54.669
You stumped?

26:55.183 --> 26:56.449
Of course I am.

26:56.641 --> 26:58.041
You're the Riddler.

26:58.614 --> 27:00.543
So you give up?

27:00.579 --> 27:02.378
- No.
- MAN: Come on, Lee!

27:02.852 --> 27:04.948
You're gonna give me the answer.

27:04.983 --> 27:06.816
(laughs)

27:06.851 --> 27:09.552
Really? How's that?

27:10.258 --> 27:12.699
Because deep down, you want to.

27:15.340 --> 27:17.191
Oh, so that's your plan?

27:17.429 --> 27:19.707
To appeal to the inner Ed?

27:19.887 --> 27:21.898
Well, you played the wrong hand, Doc.

27:21.933 --> 27:23.466
Ed is gone,

27:23.501 --> 27:25.768
and I will not be manipulated by you

27:25.804 --> 27:27.070
the way that dope was.

27:27.105 --> 27:28.271
I didn't manipulate him.

27:28.306 --> 27:30.106
- I helped him.
- No.

27:30.141 --> 27:32.008
No, you lied to him.

27:32.043 --> 27:34.444
You promised to fix him,

27:34.479 --> 27:37.548
and that pathetic dust mite
believed you,

27:37.595 --> 27:39.954
causing me to be locked
inside of his feeble mind.

27:41.267 --> 27:43.019
Okay, you have ten seconds left

27:43.054 --> 27:44.954
to find your answer.

27:46.047 --> 27:47.790
So prepare to lose.

27:47.826 --> 27:49.158
But I know the answer now.

27:49.194 --> 27:50.827
(chuckles)

27:51.744 --> 27:53.492
You just gave it to me.

27:54.699 --> 27:56.666
What are you talking about?

27:56.701 --> 28:00.470
You're right. I told Ed
I would fix him, and I didn't.

28:00.505 --> 28:02.472
I broke my promise.

28:02.507 --> 28:05.508
And that, Riddler...

28:07.545 --> 28:09.178
...is the answer.

28:09.688 --> 28:11.547
A promise.

28:12.651 --> 28:14.617
(crowd murmurs)

28:22.527 --> 28:25.128
(crowd cheering)

28:28.166 --> 28:29.966
Well played.

28:32.710 --> 28:34.637
We're only halfway through.

28:35.061 --> 28:38.608
And I assure you, you will not stump me.

28:43.515 --> 28:45.048
<i>Boo. (laughs)</i>

28:47.821 --> 28:50.053
You need to take us to your brother.

28:50.530 --> 28:52.678
I can't do that.

28:53.115 --> 28:55.117
What if he's nuttier than the other one?

28:55.142 --> 28:56.592
I'm nothing like Jerome.

28:56.628 --> 28:58.764
You want me to put you
in a cell next to his?

28:58.795 --> 29:00.163
Because that is where this is heading.

29:00.846 --> 29:02.783
And then what, Captain Gordon?

29:02.867 --> 29:04.167
You couldn't hold him.

29:04.202 --> 29:06.402
Arkham couldn't. I can.

29:06.438 --> 29:08.838
And I will make sure
Jerome never escapes again.

29:08.873 --> 29:11.240
No, no, no. Jerome comes with us.

29:11.276 --> 29:13.287
And if you want to make
this easier on yourself,

29:13.349 --> 29:15.396
I suggest you stay
the hell out of the way.

29:15.435 --> 29:16.713
BULLOCK: Oh, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

29:16.748 --> 29:18.185
The loonies are outside.

29:22.069 --> 29:24.087
No. No.

29:24.137 --> 29:26.289
No, no, no, no.

29:26.331 --> 29:28.898
- How'd they find me?
- GORDON: They must have followed Jerome.

29:28.927 --> 29:30.760
We need to move, now.

29:32.597 --> 29:34.797
(alarm buzzing)

29:34.833 --> 29:36.766
This is not good.

29:36.801 --> 29:38.167
Is there another way out of here?

29:38.203 --> 29:40.169
Yes, but I'm not leaving Ecco.

29:40.205 --> 29:42.238
The loonies will use her against us.

29:42.273 --> 29:43.806
She's devoted her life to me.

29:43.842 --> 29:46.442
We get you out first,
then we can come back for her.

29:46.478 --> 29:48.978
- Deal?
- (alarm continues buzzing)

29:49.013 --> 29:51.814
As a child, I was
obsessed with labyrinths,

29:51.850 --> 29:53.549
so I designed my house like one.

29:53.585 --> 29:55.173
You mean this place is a maze?

29:55.240 --> 29:58.074
Easy enough to get in; I'm the
only one who knows the way out.

29:58.149 --> 29:59.689
Stay close to me.

30:07.972 --> 30:09.558
The maze is built on a hundred acres.

30:09.613 --> 30:11.313
There are 73 dead ends.

30:11.415 --> 30:13.215
I once invited the top
maze designers in the country

30:13.317 --> 30:16.121
to try to solve it... one did.

30:16.176 --> 30:17.352
It took him three days.

30:17.454 --> 30:18.754
GORDON: And how much further?

30:18.856 --> 30:21.056
Not far. We just passed
the final switchback point.

30:21.104 --> 30:23.425
If I knew this thing was 100 acres,

30:23.527 --> 30:25.927
I would have stopped and got
a sandwich before we came.

30:29.366 --> 30:30.499
Ecco.

30:31.669 --> 30:32.834
Oh, thank God you're okay.

30:32.936 --> 30:34.839
Hey, hey, hey, she's hypnotized.

30:39.309 --> 30:41.143
(all grunting)

30:52.041 --> 30:54.623
Ecco, it's me.

30:54.725 --> 30:56.124
It's me. Ow!

30:56.226 --> 30:58.493
Gordon! Help!

30:58.595 --> 31:00.195
Gordon!

31:02.058 --> 31:03.365
She's a pistol.

31:03.467 --> 31:04.666
Come on.

31:08.113 --> 31:11.039
Ecco, please. Where are you taking me?

31:11.141 --> 31:13.308
- I'm taking you to Jerome.
- No.

31:13.410 --> 31:14.853
He'll do horrible things to me.

31:14.878 --> 31:15.811
Ecco...

31:15.913 --> 31:17.312
- Stop!
- (gun cocks)

31:17.414 --> 31:18.847
Ow.

31:18.949 --> 31:20.248
Let him go.

31:20.350 --> 31:21.717
(gasps)

31:23.187 --> 31:23.952
(gun drops)

31:31.924 --> 31:34.229
Thanks. He went that way.

31:34.331 --> 31:35.630
All right.

31:37.935 --> 31:39.301
GORDON: Jeremiah.

31:42.348 --> 31:44.206
Let's try this way.

31:49.880 --> 31:51.146
(sighs)

31:51.248 --> 31:54.082
JEROME: Hello, brother.

31:55.586 --> 31:56.651
(gasps)

31:59.456 --> 32:00.489
(gasps)

32:00.591 --> 32:01.957
So, how ya been?

32:02.059 --> 32:04.593
Oh, you look great! (laughing)

32:05.795 --> 32:08.638
To think I used to be
the handsome one, right?

32:08.832 --> 32:11.099
How'd you find your way
through the maze?

32:11.201 --> 32:12.868
Oh, bro,

32:12.970 --> 32:15.337
we might not look the same anymore,

32:15.421 --> 32:18.312
but we still think the same.

32:18.382 --> 32:19.775
Plus, you used to draw
those stupid things

32:19.877 --> 32:21.176
all the time as a kid.

32:21.278 --> 32:23.411
I paid attention.

32:23.514 --> 32:26.114
Hey, uh, hat-head. Take Crane.

32:26.216 --> 32:28.059
Find Jimbo and his bearded sidekick.

32:28.115 --> 32:29.223
Kill them.

32:29.253 --> 32:31.820
(chuckling)

32:31.922 --> 32:36.625
I've been waiting for this
moment for 15 years.

32:36.727 --> 32:39.827
Ever since you ran away
in the middle of the night,

32:39.881 --> 32:41.363
like a coward.

32:41.465 --> 32:43.031
- You're insane.
- Yeah.

32:43.133 --> 32:44.214
And I tried telling Mom,

32:44.268 --> 32:45.567
but she didn't want to listen to me.

32:46.675 --> 32:49.004
You blame me for everything
that's gone wrong in your life.

32:49.106 --> 32:52.340
But the truth is, Jerome,

32:52.442 --> 32:55.210
is you were born bad.

32:57.011 --> 32:59.261
Born bad, huh?

32:59.980 --> 33:03.485
So that's why you made her think
that I tried to kill you.

33:03.587 --> 33:05.220
- Right?
- Yeah, we both...

33:05.322 --> 33:07.322
What was it again? What was it?

33:07.424 --> 33:08.976
I put a blade to your throat.

33:09.015 --> 33:10.325
No, no, no, no, no. I tried to...

33:10.427 --> 33:12.718
- light you on fire.
- We both know you wanted to!

33:12.773 --> 33:15.263
Yeah, that was a funny story, wasn't it?

33:16.333 --> 33:17.732
Okay.

33:17.835 --> 33:21.036
Maybe it didn't happen
exactly like that, but...

33:21.138 --> 33:23.538
but I didn't have a choice,
and I was right.

33:23.640 --> 33:25.640
Hmm?

33:26.994 --> 33:29.096
You killed our mother.

33:31.674 --> 33:33.557
She did deserve it though.

33:33.619 --> 33:35.050
(chuckles)

33:35.152 --> 33:38.220
After that whore hid you away,

33:38.322 --> 33:40.622
she gave up on me.

33:40.724 --> 33:43.503
Poisoned by your stories.

33:43.619 --> 33:46.201
You turned everyone
I ever loved against me.

33:46.296 --> 33:48.096
My own flesh and blood!

33:48.859 --> 33:51.733
Yeah, I guess it's like what they say.

33:52.406 --> 33:55.904
We all could go insane
with just one bad day.

33:57.179 --> 34:00.742
I guess with you,
it's more like one bad spray.

34:00.844 --> 34:03.979
You'll see. (cackles)

34:07.818 --> 34:09.110
Listen to what I have to say!

34:09.188 --> 34:11.753
Oh, hell no! You are
not hypnotizing me again!

34:11.855 --> 34:14.456
(shouting)

34:14.558 --> 34:16.123
That's one way to do it.

34:16.226 --> 34:19.159
Must go, must go, must go, must go!

34:22.933 --> 34:25.634
(chuckles, exclaims)

34:25.735 --> 34:27.802
What are you gonna do to me, Jerome?

34:27.905 --> 34:29.973
Come on. I'm gonna kill you.

34:30.043 --> 34:31.005
Of course.

34:31.081 --> 34:33.331
But, first,

34:34.145 --> 34:36.777
I'm gonna drive you mad.

34:36.880 --> 34:39.380
But don't worry, you won't be alone.

34:39.483 --> 34:41.483
All of Gotham will be joining you, too.

34:41.585 --> 34:45.462
Must go! Must go! They're
after me and the Scarecrow.

34:45.554 --> 34:47.022
These guys just don't give up, huh?

34:47.123 --> 34:48.188
(Bullock yelling)

34:50.127 --> 34:51.212
(gasps)

34:51.245 --> 34:54.610
Get any closer and I splatter him.
I splatter bro-ski.

34:54.679 --> 34:55.931
- (chuckling)
- GORDON: No, you won't.

34:56.033 --> 34:57.966
If you wanted him dead, you
would have killed him already.

34:58.068 --> 34:59.768
(chuckles) He's right.

34:59.870 --> 35:01.903
- I'll see you soon. Mwah!
- (gasps)

35:04.474 --> 35:07.008
(Jerome laughing)

35:15.385 --> 35:17.052
(insects chirping)

35:19.122 --> 35:21.189
Okay, Doc.

35:21.291 --> 35:23.391
You've had enough time
to think of a riddle.

35:23.493 --> 35:25.794
I hope you've come up with a good one.

35:25.896 --> 35:27.696
I have.

35:27.798 --> 35:29.364
Then ask away.

35:41.445 --> 35:45.475
What three words are said too much...

35:45.949 --> 35:49.818
meant by few, but wanted by all?

35:49.920 --> 35:51.252
That's your riddle?

35:52.901 --> 35:55.432
You're kidding. Right?

35:56.827 --> 35:58.159
What's the answer?

35:58.261 --> 36:02.040
Easy. "I love..." (clears throat)

36:09.006 --> 36:11.673
The answer is, "I love..."

36:11.775 --> 36:13.208
I love what, Ed?

36:13.310 --> 36:15.425
- That's not my name.
- Then what's the answer?

36:15.487 --> 36:16.745
You tricked me.

36:17.675 --> 36:20.151
You're trying to awaken
a love that isn't there.

36:20.214 --> 36:23.952
If it isn't there, then say the words.

36:24.054 --> 36:25.320
WOMAN: Say it.

36:28.191 --> 36:30.158
(crowd murmuring)

36:35.287 --> 36:37.154
I won't say it.

36:37.905 --> 36:38.937
(crowd booing)

36:39.029 --> 36:40.769
- MAN: Come on.
- MAN 2: Say it.

36:40.871 --> 36:42.737
MAN 3: Say it.

36:43.785 --> 36:45.473
Time's up.

36:47.477 --> 36:50.278
(crowd cheering)

36:53.850 --> 36:58.353
ALL (chanting):
Doc, Doc, Doc, Doc, Doc...

36:58.955 --> 37:01.122
(chanting continues)

37:16.850 --> 37:18.850
(siren wailing in distance)

37:23.259 --> 37:25.159
Thank you.

37:25.214 --> 37:26.813
What did I say?!

37:26.876 --> 37:28.776
(Oswald choking)

37:29.159 --> 37:31.422
I can help you get Tabitha back.

37:31.485 --> 37:35.153
I know how to reverse your condition.

37:37.191 --> 37:38.223
(gasps)

37:38.325 --> 37:40.559
- Talk.
- This barrel

37:40.632 --> 37:42.127
is from Slaughter Swamp.

37:42.229 --> 37:44.162
It turned you into what you are.

37:44.264 --> 37:46.298
Talk.

37:46.400 --> 37:47.566
Professor Hugo Strange

37:47.668 --> 37:49.735
is the one man who can cure you.

37:49.837 --> 37:54.006
Join me, and we will find him.

37:55.876 --> 37:57.209
(gasping, coughing)

38:01.615 --> 38:04.743
I thought I was gonna
be stuck like this forever.

38:05.603 --> 38:08.916
You don't have to be, friend.

38:14.094 --> 38:15.160
Okay,

38:15.731 --> 38:17.403
I'll join you.

38:17.865 --> 38:19.931
But you better deliver.

38:22.770 --> 38:24.536
I'm not your friend.

38:27.441 --> 38:30.242
I can live with those terms.

38:56.503 --> 38:59.671
Why did you open
your club in the Narrows?

39:01.241 --> 39:04.185
You could have set up shop
anywhere in Gotham.

39:04.812 --> 39:06.511
You wanted my attention.

39:06.613 --> 39:09.286
I came back here
because the people love me.

39:09.349 --> 39:11.552
People didn't come here
because they love you, Ed.

39:11.638 --> 39:12.918
They came for the money.

39:14.516 --> 39:16.116
But I can give them what they want.

39:16.523 --> 39:18.189
I just need your help.

39:18.856 --> 39:20.692
Why would I help you?

39:20.794 --> 39:22.594
(chuckles)

39:22.696 --> 39:25.964
Because I know what you really want.

39:28.001 --> 39:29.534
You love me.

39:31.119 --> 39:33.271
You've loved me all along.

39:34.726 --> 39:36.541
You're wrong.

39:36.643 --> 39:38.877
That was Ed.

39:41.115 --> 39:42.714
Okay.

39:42.816 --> 39:44.605
So do it.

39:45.777 --> 39:47.252
Kill me.

39:47.354 --> 39:48.954
(gasps)

39:58.499 --> 40:00.465
What's your record for how many banks

40:00.567 --> 40:02.801
you've robbed in one day?

40:04.638 --> 40:06.204
Three. Why?

40:06.306 --> 40:08.807
I think you can do better.

40:08.909 --> 40:11.243
You're playing a dangerous game, Lee.

40:11.345 --> 40:13.578
I know.

40:19.486 --> 40:21.486

40:35.702 --> 40:37.736

40:40.274 --> 40:42.207
It's all right, come on.

40:48.215 --> 40:51.016
- Captain...
- It's okay.

40:51.164 --> 40:55.032
This is Jeremiah Valeska,
Jerome's twin brother.

40:55.086 --> 40:57.211
We need to put him into
protective custody.

40:57.266 --> 40:59.191
Okay, follow me.

41:02.462 --> 41:05.680
Thank you... Captain Gordon.

41:05.743 --> 41:09.634
I, uh, wouldn't be alive
if it weren't for you.

41:17.277 --> 41:19.644
Hell of a day.

41:19.746 --> 41:21.847
What are you thinking?

41:21.949 --> 41:25.951
Jerome told his brother
his plan was to turn Gotham mad.

41:26.053 --> 41:27.886
How the hell is he
gonna do that, Harvey?

41:27.988 --> 41:29.654
I don't know.

41:29.756 --> 41:32.424
I thought it already was.

41:45.606 --> 41:47.780
- (clicks)
- Damn.

41:54.514 --> 41:56.314
Doesn't even make me feel better at all.

41:56.416 --> 41:59.724
CRANE: Jerome, the test subject

41:59.786 --> 42:01.319
has arrived.

42:03.638 --> 42:05.590
Ugh. Little large

42:05.692 --> 42:07.225
for a test subject, don't you think?

42:07.327 --> 42:08.927
He is not your test subject.

42:09.029 --> 42:10.428
This is Grundy.

42:10.530 --> 42:13.098
He will make a welcome
addition to the team.

42:13.200 --> 42:15.901
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

42:16.003 --> 42:17.705
I like him.

42:17.821 --> 42:20.790
He's scary. Good thinking, Mr. Oswald.

42:20.877 --> 42:22.407
Nice to meet you, big fella.

42:22.509 --> 42:24.109
Ow.

42:25.283 --> 42:27.522
Ah. Test subject?

42:27.593 --> 42:30.382
JERVIS: Here to test your plan,
an unwilling businessman.

42:30.484 --> 42:33.718
BUSINESSMAN:
No, no, no. No, please, please.

42:33.820 --> 42:35.553
Please don't hurt me.

42:35.656 --> 42:39.830
CRANE: Oh, this... won't hurt a bit.
