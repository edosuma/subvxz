<i>NARRATOR :
Previously on Stargate Atlantis :</i>

00:03.327 --> 00:05.761
We are the last of those
you refer to as Ancients.

00:05.967 --> 00:08.561
There’s a lot of Wraith,
we could use help fighting them.

00:08.727 --> 00:12.037
We will eliminate the Wraith
at a time of our choosing.

00:12.247 --> 00:15.159
- They don’t seem very Ancient-y to me.
- Ancient-y ?

00:15.367 --> 00:18.359
WEIR : Hopefully, this is just
a stumbled beginning of a--

00:21.087 --> 00:22.884
McKAY : They’re not people.
DEX : McKay !

00:24.007 --> 00:27.238
They’re machines. Replicators.

00:28.887 --> 00:34.245
McKAY : So l’m in Atlantis and l need
to get to Earth. What do l do ?

00:34.447 --> 00:36.358
Since we no longer have
access to a ZPM...

00:36.527 --> 00:38.597
... due to unforeseeable circumstances...

00:38.767 --> 00:41.042
<i>... my only option would be
to call the Daedalus...</i>

00:41.207 --> 00:44.483
... and spend the next three weeks
waiting to get back home.

00:44.687 --> 00:46.598
Until now.

00:46.807 --> 00:51.756
<i>l give you the McKay/Carter
Intergalactic Gate Bridge.</i>

00:51.927 --> 00:55.442
Thirty-four gates from the Milky Way
and Pegasus gate systems...

00:55.607 --> 00:59.361
... have been strategically placed
in the void between our two galaxies.

00:59.527 --> 01:02.883
Simply enter on either side--
For example, Atlantis.

01:03.047 --> 01:04.081
- -and boom.

01:04.527 --> 01:07.837
A macro that l have written
specially for the occasion...

01:08.007 --> 01:11.204
... will command each gate in the chain
to store you in its buffer...

01:11.367 --> 01:16.646
... and forward you along to the next
and the next until you arrive here.

01:16.847 --> 01:20.726
Once at the Midway Space Station,
you exit the Pegasus gate system...

01:20.887 --> 01:23.765
... and enter the Milky Way gate system
where a similar macro...

01:23.927 --> 01:27.078
... designed by yours truly,
will forward you along to the SGC.

01:27.247 --> 01:30.205
Total travel time,
a little over 30 minutes.

01:30.367 --> 01:31.402
Cue applause.

01:33.927 --> 01:35.679
Thank you. Enough.

01:35.887 --> 01:38.003
Midway Space Station
isn’t completed yet, so...

01:38.167 --> 01:40.556
... we’Il test the system today
using a Puddle Jumper.

01:40.727 --> 01:42.718
- Now, given the his--
CALDWELL : Show and tell’s over.

01:42.887 --> 01:45.606
The test is about to begin.
Let’s get back to our stations.

01:45.767 --> 01:47.041
Right.

01:49.000 --> 01:55.074

02:07.367 --> 02:10.039
All systems seem to be...

02:10.207 --> 02:11.196
Hm.

02:11.687 --> 02:13.120
What ?

02:13.287 --> 02:17.280
Oh, there’s an odd echo
in the proximity sensors.

02:17.447 --> 02:19.881
Won’t affect the test, but...

02:20.367 --> 02:22.358
Yeah, we’re ready to go.

02:30.847 --> 02:33.680
<i>SHEPPARD : Gate is dialed.
Forwarding macro’s been uploaded.</i>

02:33.847 --> 02:36.202
All right, John. You have a go.

02:36.407 --> 02:40.002
All right, then. Here goes.

02:56.647 --> 02:57.682
McKAY :
We have a contact.

02:58.327 --> 03:01.000
Colonel Sheppard, right on time.
What’s your status ?

03:01.167 --> 03:04.204
It felt a little weird,
but everything seems to be in one piece.

03:04.407 --> 03:06.796
<i>Ready to proceed to next phase.</i>

03:07.007 --> 03:09.123
Uploading macro...

03:09.327 --> 03:11.557
... and initiating dialing sequence.

03:15.527 --> 03:17.245
No, no, no. This is weird.

03:17.447 --> 03:20.678
- Shall l tell him to stand down ?
- No. It’s nothing to do with the test.

03:20.847 --> 03:23.759
It’s just our sensors
aren’t working properly.

03:23.967 --> 03:25.719
<i>Daedalus ready to proceed.</i>

03:25.927 --> 03:27.076
Do l clear him ?

03:27.807 --> 03:29.399
Yeah, yeah. l’m sure he’s fine.

03:31.407 --> 03:33.682
He’s good to go. Good to go.
Yes, go ahead.

03:33.847 --> 03:35.803
Colonel Sheppard, you have a go.

03:39.807 --> 03:41.798
Jumper is away.

03:54.207 --> 03:55.435
He’s late.

03:55.607 --> 03:59.520
When traveling three million light-years,
l’m not sure there’s such a thing as late.

04:01.327 --> 04:02.760
Right. Yes.

04:02.927 --> 04:06.044
You’re just mad you didn’t get to fly
the maiden voyage yourself.

04:06.247 --> 04:10.240
General, l am quite fond
of both maidens and voyages.

04:10.407 --> 04:13.683
- Put the two together and you--
- You’re not a test pilot anymore, Jack.

04:14.367 --> 04:15.880
That’s what the president said.

04:16.527 --> 04:18.517
HARRIMAN :
Incoming wormhole.

04:24.087 --> 04:25.236
It’s about time.

04:25.847 --> 04:27.200
<i>SHEPPARD :
Sorry, sir.</i>

04:27.367 --> 04:29.801
Colonel Sheppard, welcome to Earth.

04:30.127 --> 04:33.005
<i>- Thank you, sir. Good to be back.
LANDRY : You know where to park.</i>

04:33.167 --> 04:35.761
We’Il debrief, go over the flight data
when you’re ready.

04:36.127 --> 04:37.765
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

04:41.287 --> 04:43.039
Colonel, we’re receiving a data burst.

04:43.207 --> 04:45.243
Jumper 3 has arrived
at Stargate Command.

04:45.407 --> 04:46.965
- Mission accomplished.
- It worked.

04:47.127 --> 04:49.322
- l’m already on to the next problem.
- Which is ?

04:49.487 --> 04:52.604
Well, the sensors are having
a hard time determining what it is...

04:52.767 --> 04:55.042
- ... probably due to the Doppler effect.
- What is ?

04:55.247 --> 05:00.685
l’m detecting a foreign object
traveling at. 999 the speed of light.

05:01.167 --> 05:03.283
And it’s coming this way.

06:10.687 --> 06:11.722
MAN :
We have a contact, sir.

06:13.407 --> 06:15.637
- Col. Sheppard’s back from Earth.
- Welcome back.

06:15.807 --> 06:16.796
<i>SHEPPARD :
Thank you, colonel.</i>

06:16.967 --> 06:19.879
l’ve got a takeout pizza
for everyone back in Atlantis.

06:20.047 --> 06:23.278
<i>With your permission, I’d like to upload
and dial out before it’s cold.</i>

06:23.447 --> 06:26.280
Negative. We’re putting that leg
of the trip on hold for now.

06:26.447 --> 06:29.166
Seems like we’re expecting company.

06:31.047 --> 06:34.562
Believe it or not, moving that fast
while an incredible feat of technology...

06:34.727 --> 06:35.842
... isn’t very useful.

06:36.007 --> 06:38.601
Certainly in comparison
to travel through hyperspace.

06:38.767 --> 06:42.999
Now, moving as fast as it is,
this ship-- Assuming it is a ship.

06:43.207 --> 06:46.085
- -would take at least a million years
to reach the Milky Way.

06:46.247 --> 06:49.319
That close to the speed of light,
you take relativity into account.

06:49.487 --> 06:52.718
Exactly. The people onboard--
Assuming that they are people.

06:52.887 --> 06:56.596
- -would only experience maybe 12 years.
A few stasis chambers, they’re laughing.

06:56.807 --> 06:59.958
Not laughing, they’re unconscious,
but, metaphorically--

07:00.127 --> 07:03.881
So assuming it’s a ship,
and assuming they’re people--

07:04.047 --> 07:06.686
- What do we do ?
- We try and make contact. Obviously.

07:06.847 --> 07:08.075
CALDWELL :
How do we do that ?

07:08.287 --> 07:11.040
Pull up, honk the horn,
get them to roll down their window.

07:11.247 --> 07:14.637
l’m talking about matching their speed.
This ship isn’t designed to do it.

07:14.807 --> 07:18.516
We can’t. Even if we succeeded we’d be
subject to the same time dilation effects.

07:18.687 --> 07:21.440
We’d be out of contact with Earth
and Atlantis for years.

07:21.607 --> 07:23.723
Can’t we overtake them
with our hyperdrive ?

07:23.887 --> 07:27.084
Yes, but they would blow past
as we dropped back into normal space...

07:27.287 --> 07:30.245
... because our sublight engines
are incapable of accelerating...

07:30.407 --> 07:34.002
- ... to anywhere near the speed of light.
- So we max out the sublight engines.

07:34.167 --> 07:35.839
Get as close as we can get.

07:36.007 --> 07:39.886
Yes, that might work. We should at least
be able to stay in range long enough...

07:40.047 --> 07:41.560
... to get sensor readings. Yeah.

07:41.767 --> 07:44.804
Do it. l’Il let Atlantis know
you’re gonna be late.

07:49.447 --> 07:51.199
Did you really get pizza for everyone ?

07:51.367 --> 07:54.677
Because it would be a shame for that
to go waste if we’re going to--

07:55.287 --> 07:57.926
Yeah, okay.
So solve this first, and then--

08:03.647 --> 08:07.276
Sir, we’ve got everything we’re gonna
get out of the sublight engines.

08:07.447 --> 08:11.326
They’re going to fly by us
in three, two, one.

08:19.327 --> 08:21.283
Interesting.

08:21.487 --> 08:23.796
- What ?
- If these readings are correct...

08:23.967 --> 08:26.197
- ... and to be fair, they may not be--
- Rodney.

08:27.367 --> 08:29.358
It’s an Ancient warship.

08:29.767 --> 08:31.086
It’s possibly Aurora-class.

08:32.287 --> 08:33.275
Who’s flying it ?

08:33.967 --> 08:35.798
l would imagine Ancients.

08:35.967 --> 08:39.083
There hasn’t been any of them around
for over 10,000 years.

08:39.287 --> 08:42.756
Relativity. Look. Remember, for them,
only a handful of years have passed.

08:42.967 --> 08:46.755
- Don’t those ships have hyperdrives ?
- Maybe it was damaged in battle.

08:46.927 --> 08:49.964
It happens with us all the time.
Maybe it conked out on the way...

08:50.127 --> 08:52.766
... and they had to continue
close to light speed.

08:52.967 --> 08:55.959
They got light-years away from Pegasus
without leaving years ago.

08:56.127 --> 08:58.277
You know their subspace drive specs
better...

08:58.447 --> 09:01.757
... but an Aurora-class ship has
the power to do what you’re suggesting ?

09:01.927 --> 09:05.078
- Well, maybe they have a ZPM.
- That would be worth finding out.

09:05.247 --> 09:07.966
We need to send them a message
before they get out of range.

09:08.127 --> 09:11.324
Like :« ou » ?We are humans from Earth,
currently occupying Atlantis. »

09:11.487 --> 09:13.398
Why don’t we just ask them
to slow down ?

09:13.567 --> 09:16.206
Colonel Caldwell,
the unidentified vessel is slowing down.

09:16.807 --> 09:17.876
Maybe they heard me.

09:18.087 --> 09:19.406
No, they saw us.

09:19.727 --> 09:23.515
And they’re not just slowing down.
They slammed on the brakes at 27 g’s.

09:23.687 --> 09:25.200
So now what ?

09:27.807 --> 09:32.403
<i>Unknown vessel, l am Captain Helia
of the Lantian warship Tria.</i>

09:33.367 --> 09:35.437
Our ship has suffered damage.

09:35.607 --> 09:39.486
We scanned your vessel and determined
that it is capable of hyperspace travel.

09:39.647 --> 09:41.524
We’ve begun deceleration maneuvers.

09:42.047 --> 09:45.403
Will you render assistance
in a form of hyperspace transport ?

09:45.607 --> 09:47.484
Well, yes. Yes, of course, we will.

09:49.527 --> 09:51.802
- l don’t think she can hear you.
- Open a channel.

09:53.647 --> 09:56.559
<i>This is Colonel Steven Caldwell
of the Earth ship Daedalus.</i>

09:56.727 --> 10:00.037
It would be an honor to assist you
in any way we possibly can.

10:02.727 --> 10:05.446
We’re going to meet Ancients.
Flesh and blood Ancients...

10:05.607 --> 10:08.201
... who know everything.
l don’t know what to ask first.

10:08.367 --> 10:11.245
It’s gonna be hours
before we match velocities for transport.

10:11.447 --> 10:13.597
That should give you time
to write that list.

10:13.767 --> 10:15.325
Right. Right.

10:16.847 --> 10:19.645
They were battle-scarred
and already on their way to Earth...

10:19.807 --> 10:21.399
... when their hyperdrive gave out.

10:21.567 --> 10:24.127
They decided it’s best to
continue forward than go back.

10:24.287 --> 10:26.755
- And how many survivors ?
- Just over a hundred.

10:26.967 --> 10:30.846
Word has spread amongst my people.
They believe this return was foretold.

10:31.007 --> 10:33.919
It marks the turning in the tide
in the war against the Wraith.

10:34.127 --> 10:35.446
l don’t know about that.

10:35.607 --> 10:38.246
<i>Dr. Weir ? The Daedalus is ready
to beam down our people...</i>

10:38.407 --> 10:41.080
- ... and the Ancient delegation.
- Thank you.

10:47.007 --> 10:52.127
<i>Dr. Weir, Ronon, Teyla, this is Helia,
captain of the Ancient ship Tria.</i>

10:52.687 --> 10:55.406
- It’s an honor to meet you.
- Thank you.

10:55.567 --> 10:59.242
From what l’m told, you’ve done
a remarkable job preserving our city.

10:59.447 --> 11:01.563
We did what we could
with what we had.

11:02.487 --> 11:04.523
l need to speak
to the leader of your people.

11:04.687 --> 11:06.518
l’m in charge
of the Atlantis expedition.

11:06.687 --> 11:08.484
You misunderstand me, Dr. Weir.

11:08.687 --> 11:12.475
l need to talk to the one who can speak
for all the people of Earth.

11:13.167 --> 11:16.284
That can certainly be arranged.
But may l ask why ?

11:19.367 --> 11:21.437
What is that ?
How come l’ve never seen that ?

11:27.607 --> 11:31.043
- Excuse me. What’s going on ?
- Thank you for all you’ve done, Dr. Weir.

11:31.527 --> 11:34.758
But your guardianship of this city
is no longer necessary.

11:35.367 --> 11:38.120
The city is now under my control.

11:45.167 --> 11:47.727
HELIA : We were in a battle
with Wraith cruisers.

11:49.007 --> 11:51.077
They proved too much for us.

11:51.447 --> 11:54.041
So we started back to Atlantis...

11:54.207 --> 11:57.517
... only to be told the final evacuation
was already in progress.

11:57.687 --> 12:00.485
l decided to push on to Earth
and join the evacuees.

12:00.687 --> 12:04.680
And even when our hyperdrive failed,
we decided to continue on.

12:05.127 --> 12:07.800
l can’t begin to imagine what you...

12:07.967 --> 12:10.879
... and your crew must be going through
right now.

12:11.087 --> 12:13.965
We owe you and your people
a debt of gratitude...

12:14.287 --> 12:16.721
... but we’ve just returned home.

12:17.327 --> 12:20.603
Home to a place we thought
we’d never set eyes on again.

12:21.047 --> 12:23.402
And we need some time.

12:23.807 --> 12:24.842
Alone.

12:25.647 --> 12:29.356
You do know that we’ve shed
our own fair share of blood...

12:29.527 --> 12:31.483
... defending the city from the Wraith.

12:31.687 --> 12:33.279
By your own admission...

12:33.447 --> 12:35.483
... you are responsible
for waking the Wraith.

12:37.327 --> 12:40.524
- Right.
- And by your own admission...

12:40.687 --> 12:43.838
... you are responsible for the emergence
of the Wraith as a species.

12:44.047 --> 12:47.039
The fact is,
if it weren’t for our expedition...

12:47.207 --> 12:48.765
... there would be no Atlantis.

12:48.967 --> 12:51.527
No one’s saying
the city doesn’t belong to you...

12:51.727 --> 12:53.922
... or that you don’t belong here.

12:54.127 --> 12:57.039
- What we’re saying is that--
- What we’re asking--

13:00.447 --> 13:03.120
What we’re asking...

13:03.687 --> 13:05.757
... is that we be allowed to stay here.

13:05.967 --> 13:09.084
WOOLSEY : There is so much
that we can learn from you.

13:09.647 --> 13:12.400
And in return, we can offer supplies,
manpower...

13:12.567 --> 13:16.640
... the kind of support you’Il need
to restore Atlantis to its former glory.

13:16.807 --> 13:20.641
The day will come when your people
will once again have a place here.

13:21.727 --> 13:24.764
But that is not this day.

13:28.887 --> 13:30.081
You should be in there.

13:30.247 --> 13:32.920
l don’t know what l could say
to make any difference.

13:33.087 --> 13:35.476
SHEPPARD :
You’re right. They want us out of here.

13:35.647 --> 13:38.605
But why ? There are maybe
a hundred or so of them.

13:38.767 --> 13:40.519
They could use us.
They might need us.

13:40.687 --> 13:42.882

Élizabeth, why haven’t you taken
another position ?

27:18.247 --> 27:21.842

with l. O.A. and Homeworld Security...

- You don’t need to be here for that.

You’re sure only sending one Jumper up
to fend it off is the right thing to do ?

28:03.087 --> 28:04.918
It is impossible for them to harm us.

- It didn’t work out.

It may have something to do
with our first kiss being through Rodney.

l was informed they had a law
written into their base code...

29:52.127 --> 29:53.446
How the hell did this happen ?

29:55.927 --> 30:00.603
It is remotely possible that in trying
to rewrite Niam’s base code l--

30:00.767 --> 30:03.486
We may have opened the door for them
to make other changes.

30:03.967 --> 30:04.956
You did this ?

At the time, we thought it was
the only possible way to save the city.

McKAY :
They emit a directional energy beam...

39:36.807 --> 39:38.798
... that disrupts connection
between nanites.

39:38.967 --> 39:39.956
Not what l asked.

39:41.567 --> 39:43.717
- Yes, they work good.
DEX : Good.

39:44.487 --> 39:47.445
So you need us because we know
our way around the city ?

39:47.727 --> 39:49.957
l need you because you’re part
of our team.

39:50.407 --> 39:53.046
There may be hundreds of Replicators
on Atlantis by now.

39:53.207 --> 39:54.526
We’ve got a plan. A good one.

39:54.687 --> 39:57.679
l wouldn’t ask you to come with
if l didn’t think we could do it.

39:57.847 --> 40:01.396
O’Neill and Woolsey were on Atlantis
when the Replicators attacked.

40:01.567 --> 40:03.285
There’s a chance they’re still alive.

40:03.487 --> 40:08.038
l’Il be damned if l let a bunch of
Replicators take our home away from us.

40:08.207 --> 40:10.801
So you with us ?

40:22.607 --> 40:26.919
Okay, l think l’ve loaded up the GDO.
It’Il lower the shield when we dial.

40:27.127 --> 40:29.277
- Go for it.
- All right.

40:29.447 --> 40:31.358
Dialing Atlantis.

40:33.767 --> 40:35.758
And...

40:41.047 --> 40:43.242
What’s happening ? Activate the shield.

40:45.167 --> 40:47.203
- l can’t.
- That’s confirmation.

40:47.367 --> 40:50.962
- Gate shield has been lowered.
- Hope this little plan of ours works.

40:51.167 --> 40:52.361
Yeah, you and me both.
