WEBVTT

00:52.366 --> 00:53.566
After Hyun-jun and Sa-woo

00:53.666 --> 00:55.366
successfully accomplished
their first mission,

00:55.500 --> 00:57.366
they receive a vacation as a reward.

00:59.966 --> 01:03.066
Hyun-jun and Seung-hee, who are secretly
involved in a romantic relationship,

01:03.333 --> 01:05.500
take a trip to Akita together.

01:06.000 --> 01:10.300
Sa-woo, as a solo, was sent on a mission
to aid Seung-ryong Hong's asylum.

01:11.566 --> 01:13.966
Hyun-jun and Seung-hee
were also sent to Hungary

01:14.400 --> 01:15.833
after returning from their trip.

01:18.133 --> 01:19.433
San Baek gives Hyun-jun

01:19.700 --> 01:21.433
a solo mission to assassinate
Seong-cheol Yun,

01:21.500 --> 01:24.100
the president of
the Supreme People's Assembly Presidium.

01:25.933 --> 01:29.866
Hyun-jun, despite the tight security
of the North Korean Supreme Guard,

01:30.033 --> 01:33.533
successfully assassinates his target,
but is seriously wounded.

01:37.000 --> 01:38.666
Hyun-jun hides at a safe house

01:38.866 --> 01:41.533
and requests San Baek
for a rescue, but is rejected.

01:42.866 --> 01:45.933
He is shocked by the actions
of his best friend, Sa-woo

01:46.166 --> 01:47.600
who came to rescue him.

01:50.833 --> 01:51.800
Sa-woo.

01:58.100 --> 01:59.966
EPISODE 5

03:05.733 --> 03:06.966
You startled me.

03:08.500 --> 03:09.466
The situation isn't good.

03:10.900 --> 03:13.100
Let's talk later and get out of here now.

03:19.333 --> 03:21.633
If we go to the airfield
where we handed over Seung-ryong Hong,

03:22.900 --> 03:24.133
we should be able to escape.

03:43.366 --> 03:44.366
Sa-woo.

03:46.600 --> 03:47.733
I'm sorry.

03:50.133 --> 03:51.166
I'm under orders.

04:08.033 --> 04:09.033
You...

04:10.933 --> 04:11.966
Why would you...

04:13.333 --> 04:14.366
If you were me...

04:25.733 --> 04:26.733
I'm sorry.

05:20.366 --> 05:21.566
It's the team leader's order.

05:21.966 --> 05:22.900
Wait outside.

05:30.833 --> 05:31.966
Yes, sir.

05:32.033 --> 05:33.500
I got it.

05:45.366 --> 05:47.566
Capturing him alive is meaningless.

05:49.433 --> 05:50.566
Shoot to kill.

05:53.033 --> 05:54.366
Inform everyone in the team.

05:56.366 --> 05:57.566
If we kill him,

05:57.633 --> 05:59.133
we can't investigate the case.

06:01.166 --> 06:02.966
Don't make me repeat my order.

06:04.300 --> 06:06.200
As soon as you see him,

06:07.333 --> 06:08.600
kill him.

09:00.566 --> 09:01.733
How did it go?

09:02.200 --> 09:03.266
I failed.

09:05.266 --> 09:06.633
What about TK1?

09:06.700 --> 09:08.233
He went into hiding.

09:10.033 --> 09:12.733
But, all North Korean Supreme Guard agents

09:12.800 --> 09:14.733
and the Hungarian police are after him.

09:15.766 --> 09:17.933
It will be very difficult for him
to leave Budapest.

09:18.666 --> 09:20.700
You  must find him first.

09:21.266 --> 09:22.266
Find him and kill him.

09:25.066 --> 09:26.300
Are you telling me

09:26.366 --> 09:27.966
to kill Hyun-jun?

09:29.933 --> 09:30.900
I can't do that.

09:32.666 --> 09:33.766
That means,

09:34.066 --> 09:36.733
you deny yourself as a NSS agent,

09:36.800 --> 09:37.966
am I right?

09:40.766 --> 09:42.000
Why must I kill him?

09:42.600 --> 09:44.066
Why can't I rescue him?

09:46.633 --> 09:47.666
I will go rescue him.

09:47.733 --> 09:49.166
Do you still not understand?

09:50.466 --> 09:52.866
This was planned right from the start.

09:54.666 --> 09:57.100
It's beyond my power to decide.

09:57.300 --> 09:58.266
Then,

09:59.166 --> 10:00.700
who is making all these decisions?

10:02.133 --> 10:03.166
Please tell me.

10:05.133 --> 10:06.866
When did you first meet Hyun-jun?

10:09.433 --> 10:10.966
I met him in the special task force.

10:11.833 --> 10:12.900
What do you know

10:13.933 --> 10:15.966
about his past?

10:23.666 --> 10:25.966
You'll find out why he was chosen,

10:27.200 --> 10:30.500
and why the NSS
has decided to abandon him.

10:34.866 --> 10:35.900
You're dismissed.

10:42.800 --> 10:44.133
Whatever the reason may be,

10:45.300 --> 10:46.533
I can't do it.

10:48.433 --> 10:49.300
I'm sorry.

10:50.500 --> 10:51.500
Well then,

10:52.533 --> 10:55.166
I'll have to find someone else
if you can't do it.

10:56.300 --> 10:57.900
Tell Seung-hee Choi to come in.

11:21.333 --> 11:22.766
Director Baek is on the line.

11:23.200 --> 11:24.233
Okay.

11:26.800 --> 11:27.866
It's me.

11:29.133 --> 11:30.433
Is it true that

11:31.033 --> 11:32.833
Seong-cheol Yun was shot and killed?

11:33.733 --> 11:34.633
Yes.

11:34.800 --> 11:36.233
Are we

11:37.100 --> 11:38.566
involved in that incident?

11:40.000 --> 11:41.233
Oh, no.

11:41.866 --> 11:43.466
What we've gathered so far

11:43.966 --> 11:46.333
is that it's related to
an internal power struggle in North Korea.

11:47.000 --> 11:49.433
It has nothing to do with us.

11:50.633 --> 11:51.566
All right.

11:53.766 --> 11:55.866
He said it has nothing to do with us.

11:56.033 --> 11:57.733
The North blamed us...

11:58.600 --> 12:01.266
as a way to cover up
an internal power struggle of theirs.

12:02.366 --> 12:04.833
Inform everyone of this
in National Security,

12:05.566 --> 12:08.600
and come up with solutions and
measures to handle the situation.

12:09.400 --> 12:10.300
Yes, sir.

12:25.866 --> 12:26.733
It's me.

12:27.500 --> 12:28.333
Begin the mission.

12:32.866 --> 12:33.933
Where is Kim Hyun-jun's desk?

12:35.966 --> 12:36.833
It's over here.

12:37.266 --> 12:38.166
Confiscate everything.

12:51.833 --> 12:52.866
Open it already.

12:59.666 --> 13:00.800
What are you doing?

13:04.033 --> 13:06.166
We are confiscating all items
belonging to Hyun-jun Kim.

13:06.766 --> 13:07.666
Confiscating his items?

13:08.433 --> 13:09.333
What's the reason?

13:15.733 --> 13:16.933
He is charged with espionage.

13:19.733 --> 13:22.466
As of this moment, if anyone
communicates with Hyun-jun Kim,

13:23.533 --> 13:25.933
you may be arrested and be under
investigation for espionage.

13:27.800 --> 13:28.700
Keep that in mind.

13:43.866 --> 13:44.733
Mr. Oh.

13:49.433 --> 13:50.333
Mr. Oh.

13:51.400 --> 13:52.400
What is it?

13:53.233 --> 13:54.400
Goodness.

14:00.133 --> 14:02.766
What's going on? Huh?

14:02.866 --> 14:03.900
We must confiscate

14:04.500 --> 14:06.366
all information KCSI has on Hyun-jun Kim.

14:08.033 --> 14:09.033
Why?

14:09.100 --> 14:11.533
Hyun-jun Kim is currently
charged with espionage.

14:13.233 --> 14:14.233
Huh? What?

14:15.333 --> 14:16.800
-Confiscate all his documents.
-Yes, sir.

14:22.200 --> 14:23.366
Goodness.

14:31.066 --> 14:32.266
Hey, Mr. Park.

14:39.633 --> 14:40.833
What on earth is going on?

14:42.100 --> 14:44.400
Why is Hyun-jun Kim
charged with espionage?

14:45.933 --> 14:48.333
I'm not sure what's going on.

14:48.966 --> 14:51.033
Who made these false charges?

14:53.800 --> 14:55.500
I think it's Mr. Baek.

15:03.700 --> 15:06.500
Another innocent person
becomes a scapegoat.

15:07.033 --> 15:07.966
What?

15:08.800 --> 15:10.266
What do you mean?

15:12.666 --> 15:15.266
You may not know as it happened
before you came here.

15:15.866 --> 15:16.900
During the history of NSS,

15:18.266 --> 15:22.933
there were two other agents
who were charged with espionage.

15:23.700 --> 15:25.800
What happened to them?

15:27.400 --> 15:29.133
They disappeared like they never existed.

15:30.800 --> 15:32.566
If someone is a spy for our enemies,

15:32.633 --> 15:34.666
he needs to be punished, right?

15:35.000 --> 15:37.366
However, without following
any proper procedures,

15:37.566 --> 15:39.233
they just disappeared into thin air.

15:40.100 --> 15:41.233
I don't understand.

15:42.366 --> 15:44.466
How could something like that happen?

15:45.466 --> 15:46.600
You just wait and see.

15:47.333 --> 15:51.500
It will be very difficult
to see Hyun-jun Kim, ever again.

16:13.566 --> 16:15.933
Agent Hyun-jun Kim is charged with
espionage. Do not contact him.

16:25.300 --> 16:26.233
This is Tae-sung Hwang.

16:26.300 --> 16:27.600
It's Seung-hee Choi.

16:27.666 --> 16:28.766
Ms. Choi.

16:30.266 --> 16:31.666
What's going on?

16:32.900 --> 16:35.400
Even internal investigators are here
and it's a total mess.

16:35.666 --> 16:37.333
They're saying TK1
was involved in espionage.

16:37.833 --> 16:39.033
What are they talking about?

16:39.466 --> 16:40.333
I don't know.

16:40.900 --> 16:42.300
Tell me where TK2 is.

16:42.366 --> 16:45.033
I can't. I might get in trouble
if they catch me

16:45.500 --> 16:46.666
doing anything suspicious.

16:53.766 --> 16:54.633
Hello?

16:55.600 --> 16:56.600
It's Seung-hee.

16:57.733 --> 16:58.700
Where are you right now?

16:59.200 --> 17:00.066
I'm in Budapest.

17:00.366 --> 17:01.566
I have a favor to ask.

17:52.833 --> 17:53.766
It's me.

17:57.233 --> 17:58.566
Everything is done.

18:41.300 --> 18:42.766
I transferred what you asked for.

18:43.866 --> 18:46.266
They took all measures to close down TK1,

18:46.633 --> 18:48.066
so I couldn't access it.

18:48.766 --> 18:51.100
Mr. Baek is at Lake Balaton
in Hungary right now.

18:51.533 --> 18:54.333
Trace all the calls he made.

18:54.533 --> 18:55.766
Seung-hee, I can't...

18:56.533 --> 18:57.500
Please.

18:58.266 --> 19:01.800
And if you find TK1 in the list of calls,
trace his last known location for me.

19:37.433 --> 19:38.466
Sa-woo.

19:39.633 --> 19:40.600
I'm sorry.

19:45.366 --> 19:46.233
I'm under orders.

19:54.500 --> 19:55.633
If you were me...

20:44.433 --> 20:45.666
I can't believe it.

20:46.166 --> 20:47.966
Hyun-jun wouldn't have
done something like this.

20:48.600 --> 20:49.600
Something is wrong.

20:50.666 --> 20:52.233
I must talk to him in person.

20:52.566 --> 20:53.600
Where is he right now?

20:57.866 --> 20:59.466
He's hiding somewhere in Budapest.

21:01.600 --> 21:03.433
North Korean Supreme Guard agents

21:03.500 --> 21:05.133
and the Hungarian police are after him.

21:27.800 --> 21:29.733
If we don't remain objective,

21:31.666 --> 21:34.366
it will be even more dangerous for
Hyun-jun and everyone else.

22:52.200 --> 22:53.300
Is it early tomorrow morning?

22:54.766 --> 22:55.600
Yes.

23:00.200 --> 23:01.033
What is it?

23:02.533 --> 23:03.433
You know what?

23:03.566 --> 23:05.700
You were nervous the whole day.

23:06.500 --> 23:08.333
I'm not nervous.

23:11.066 --> 23:12.000
Don't worry.

23:12.166 --> 23:13.300
I'll be back soon.

23:15.800 --> 23:16.733
See you soon.

23:18.666 --> 23:19.866
Okay.

23:21.433 --> 23:22.266
Good night.

23:24.566 --> 23:25.433
Okay.

23:29.500 --> 23:30.366
Hyun-jun.

24:28.000 --> 24:30.600
Someone is in the office
and he's bleeding.

24:30.966 --> 24:33.166
Please send an ambulance.

24:42.233 --> 24:45.066
Supreme Guard agents are on the move.
I think they found Hyun-jun.

25:15.766 --> 25:17.433
You will split into three separate teams.

25:18.200 --> 25:20.033
Request the Hungarian authorities
for air support.

25:20.700 --> 25:22.500
Each team leader must report everything.

25:23.300 --> 25:24.500
-Move in.
-Yes, sir.

27:50.866 --> 27:52.666
Tango has arrived at the location.

27:53.066 --> 27:54.500
Where is the location of the target?

27:55.166 --> 27:56.233
It's 201.

29:49.433 --> 29:50.500
We got him.

29:50.566 --> 29:51.766
We're going in to identify him.

30:04.266 --> 30:05.366
He broke through.

30:05.433 --> 30:07.333
We're chasing after him.
Requesting Backup.

30:21.333 --> 30:22.366
Here.

30:22.866 --> 30:25.133
It's a map of the building
and the positions of those deployed.

30:28.500 --> 30:29.466
The exit in the west...

30:30.333 --> 30:31.600
is the only way out.

30:32.866 --> 30:33.966
We have to get there first.

30:40.900 --> 30:41.766
I'm sorry.

30:46.666 --> 30:48.633
The only exit left is the one in the west.

30:50.133 --> 30:51.166
Lock it down.

35:20.233 --> 35:21.833
The situation has gotten worse.

35:22.666 --> 35:25.100
It's dangerous, even for us,
to stay here any longer.

35:25.266 --> 35:26.233
What about Hyun-jun?

35:29.566 --> 35:31.266
We know he hasn't been caught yet.

35:32.666 --> 35:33.866
Do you think he escaped?

35:35.866 --> 35:37.700
All the roads to the outside are blocked.

35:42.900 --> 35:43.800
It won't be easy.

36:08.033 --> 36:09.100
Get some rest.

36:24.266 --> 36:25.200
Okay.

36:25.933 --> 36:26.766
I understand.

36:29.533 --> 36:30.566
I'll do that.

36:37.166 --> 36:38.066
Everyone leave.

36:43.133 --> 36:44.800
Except Sun-hwa.

36:51.233 --> 36:52.866
I only have until tomorrow.

36:54.600 --> 36:55.733
You'll have to take charge now.

36:57.933 --> 37:00.300
If I can't get him,
you'll have to chase him until the end.

37:03.466 --> 37:05.700
You must capture or kill him,
no matter what.

37:07.366 --> 37:09.000
That's the only way we'll survive.

37:29.633 --> 37:30.600
It's me.

37:36.600 --> 37:37.866
What is the reason

37:38.700 --> 37:39.766
that you abandoned me?

37:41.300 --> 37:44.400
What should I say for you to accept it?

37:46.866 --> 37:48.033
This was

37:48.933 --> 37:51.566
determined as soon as you became

37:52.033 --> 37:53.333
an NSS agent.

37:54.933 --> 37:56.533
I'll get back, no matter what.

37:58.200 --> 37:59.166
And when I do,

38:01.333 --> 38:04.900
you'll pay for determining my fate.

38:12.400 --> 38:13.566
Seung-hee is over there.

38:14.933 --> 38:16.133
Her fate...

38:17.666 --> 38:21.166
may be the same as yours.

42:04.766 --> 42:07.800
I heard Seong-cheol Yun was killed
due to an internal power struggle.

42:09.333 --> 42:11.766
The government said
it's not related to us at all.

42:12.833 --> 42:14.900
Everyone at NSS thinks so too.

42:16.400 --> 42:17.500
No, I killed him.

42:20.300 --> 42:22.166
I was ordered to do so,

42:24.133 --> 42:25.500
and I accomplished the mission.

42:29.833 --> 42:31.200
But they abandoned me.

42:33.633 --> 42:35.366
They intended to do so from the beginning.

42:36.866 --> 42:37.900
That can't be.

42:39.433 --> 42:40.400
What about Sa-woo?

42:41.566 --> 42:43.133
Didn't you know he came to save you?

42:44.833 --> 42:45.933
Sa-woo is also here.

42:47.200 --> 42:48.266
If we work together,

42:48.433 --> 42:50.933
even if the Hungarian police
and Supreme Guard agents come after us,

42:51.900 --> 42:53.233
we'll escape somehow.

42:58.966 --> 42:59.900
Sa-woo...

43:11.933 --> 43:13.100
To confirm that the death of Yun

43:13.933 --> 43:16.800
isn't related to the south,

43:19.000 --> 43:20.566
I shouldn't be alive.

43:25.166 --> 43:26.266
If you stay with me,

43:27.866 --> 43:28.966
both Sa-woo...

43:31.866 --> 43:33.000
and you will be in danger.

43:36.633 --> 43:37.633
Just go back.

43:40.300 --> 43:41.400
I can't.

43:44.333 --> 43:45.966
I can't leave you like this.

43:47.466 --> 43:48.300
Seung-hee.

43:51.333 --> 43:52.866
Even if you're telling me the truth,

43:54.700 --> 43:56.400
I can't leave you.

43:59.133 --> 44:00.766
If we die, we die together.

44:03.200 --> 44:04.866
I can't leave you like this.

45:34.700 --> 45:36.933
We are called Supreme Guard

45:39.433 --> 45:41.066
not only because we're good.

45:42.966 --> 45:45.800
It's because the nation commands us
to never fail no matter what.

45:50.133 --> 45:51.233
We may leave

45:52.333 --> 45:54.233
a stain in the history of Supreme Guard.

45:56.166 --> 45:57.033
If we do,

45:58.400 --> 46:00.166
we'll all become sinners.

46:22.666 --> 46:24.233
We have his location.

46:25.700 --> 46:26.733
This is our last chance.

46:28.133 --> 46:29.000
Move out.

46:41.233 --> 46:43.833
I'll check the train schedule. Stay here.

46:44.866 --> 46:45.733
Okay.

46:47.133 --> 46:48.033
I'll be back soon.

49:37.833 --> 49:38.833
Stop right there!

50:00.233 --> 50:01.266
Drop the gun!

50:03.133 --> 50:04.166
Drop the gun!

50:04.400 --> 50:05.466
Drop the gun!

50:18.000 --> 50:19.333
We're diplomats.

50:20.000 --> 50:21.600
We're chasing after an assassin.

51:15.433 --> 51:16.366
Hello?

51:52.200 --> 51:53.566
If we die, we die together.

51:55.566 --> 51:57.233
I can't leave you like this.

53:30.866 --> 53:31.800
Hyun-jun.

54:51.333 --> 54:53.666
I'll check the train schedule. Stay here.

57:08.933 --> 57:09.900
I'll take care of him.

57:09.966 --> 57:10.900
Okay.

1:00:29.833 --> 1:00:31.133
Hyun-jun.

1:00:35.166 --> 1:00:36.300
Sa-woo.

1:01:18.500 --> 1:01:19.433
Did Hyun-jun...

1:01:19.500 --> 1:01:21.433
I told you to erase the memories
of him as a friend.

1:01:22.100 --> 1:01:23.033
How's Seung-hee?

1:01:23.966 --> 1:01:25.000
She can't seem to get over

1:01:25.733 --> 1:01:26.833
Hyun-jun's death.

1:01:29.533 --> 1:01:30.533
Are you saying

1:01:30.900 --> 1:01:32.133
you know who they are?

1:01:32.900 --> 1:01:34.200
This is your last chance to live.

1:01:35.200 --> 1:01:36.200
Go get him.

1:01:37.733 --> 1:01:38.800
He's in Japan right now.

1:01:40.366 --> 1:01:42.533
What happened, sir?

1:01:43.400 --> 1:01:44.766
You may die if you keep doing this.

1:01:44.833 --> 1:01:46.000
What I'm saying is...

1:01:47.100 --> 1:01:49.233
he's history now.

1:01:51.800 --> 1:01:53.033
What are you doing?

1:01:57.633 --> 1:01:59.166
If I don't kill you,

1:01:59.233 --> 1:02:00.433
I'll have nowhere to go.
