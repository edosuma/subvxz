Why didn't you send up
more ships to look for her?!

21:32.740 --> 21:35.965
[HUEY] Then you encouraged her to
keep flying through a cosmic storm?!

21:35.968 --> 21:37.609
You could have called her down!

21:37.612 --> 21:39.289
There were too many variables!

21:39.292 --> 21:41.867
[DEWEY] So you're the
reason our mom is gone.

21:41.870 --> 21:43.489
Cheap old Scrooge probably bailed

21:43.490 --> 21:45.609
as soon as it put a
dent in his Money Bin.

21:45.612 --> 21:47.819
[BEAKLEY] Well, you've
successfully pushed your family

21:47.820 --> 21:51.449
and everyone who cared
about you away. Again.

21:51.450 --> 21:53.160
I hope you're happy.

21:58.080 --> 22:00.023
I am.
