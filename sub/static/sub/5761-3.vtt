<i>My name
is melinda gordon.</i>

00:09.777 --> 00:15.226
<i>I'm married, I live in a small town,
and I own an antique shop.</i>

00:15.318 --> 00:17.318
<i>I might be just like you.</i>

00:17.329 --> 00:21.404
<i>Except that from the time I was a little
girl, I knew that I could talk to the dead.</i>

00:22.486 --> 00:25.374
<i>Earthbound spirits,
my grandmother called them.</i>

00:25.810 --> 00:28.277
<i>They're stuck here because they
have unfinished business with the living</i>

00:28.313 --> 00:30.801
<i>and they come to me
for help.</i>

00:33.755 --> 00:39.037
<i>In order to tell you my story,
I have to tell you theirs.</i>

00:43.327 --> 00:46.172
- It's beautiful.
- I've always wanted one.

00:46.232 --> 00:48.897
It's very southern gothic.
I love it.

00:48.897 --> 00:51.733
- Can I borrow this, too?
- Good luck lifting it.

00:51.736 --> 00:54.223
Just kidding.
These lamps'll be fine.

00:54.868 --> 00:59.131
I'm showing a house this afternoon,
and it's decorated like a monastery,

00:59.145 --> 01:01.642
so I just wanna add
a little color. Oop.

01:01.785 --> 01:03.861
- Careful.
- Got it. Ah.

01:06.445 --> 01:08.442
- Hey, hey.
- Hey.

01:08.445 --> 01:11.843
Melinda, this is amy and jordan.
They're the couple I told you about.

01:11.848 --> 01:13.412
They just bought
the house on gardner.

01:13.445 --> 01:16.213
They're in the process of decorating,
so I told them about your store.

01:16.225 --> 01:18.481
- Welcome to the neighborhood.
- Thanks.

01:18.486 --> 01:20.593
You don't sell
plumbing supplies, do you?

01:20.595 --> 01:23.961
I have some 19th century faucets,
but that's about it.

01:24.148 --> 01:26.612
- Why?
- The plumbing in that house is nuts.

01:26.618 --> 01:28.610
I- it's like the water
pressure's schizophrenic.

01:28.618 --> 01:34.161
Yeah. Sometimes water just comes gushing
out, even when we haven't got the faucet on.

01:35.235 --> 01:38.213
- Make them leave.
- Well, it's not just that.

01:38.218 --> 01:40.211
The lights just flicker
for no reason.

01:40.217 --> 01:42.513
Look, I'll come out there, and I'll
bring a plumber and an electrician.

01:42.528 --> 01:45.643
Go away.

01:48.778 --> 01:50.772
Hey, maybe I can help.

01:50.775 --> 01:55.842
My husband and i had some troubles when
we first moved in, and he's pretty handy.

01:55.848 --> 01:58.331
Why don't I come by tomorrow, and
I will take care of everything.

01:58.338 --> 02:00.803
Yeah, I'll come with you,
and I can help you decorate.

02:00.818 --> 02:05.843
I'd love that. And delia was right.
I love your place. It's gorgeous...

03:00.275 --> 03:02.620
Seems to be working
perfectly.

03:02.625 --> 03:05.631
Yesterday there was
water pouring out everywhere,

03:05.636 --> 03:07.270
and neither of us
had turned it on.

03:07.318 --> 03:11.231
Let me show you what's going on with the
tub upstairs. It hasn't stopped dripping.

03:13.885 --> 03:15.790
You know, I knew this
was gonna happen.

03:15.795 --> 03:18.263
As soon as she gets here,
everything works great.

03:19.427 --> 03:21.730
- You wanna go sit outside?
- Sure.

03:26.988 --> 03:29.130
- How did you end up in grandview?
- Well, we were living

03:29.175 --> 03:32.813
in a tiny apartment in the city, and
last christmas, we drove up to hamilton

03:32.848 --> 03:35.542
to see jordan's parents,
and we passed through here,

03:35.546 --> 03:38.223
and I just fell in love
with the town.

03:38.267 --> 03:41.521
You know, jordan's a music producer,
so he can pretty much work from anywhere.

03:41.708 --> 03:43.880
What are you gonna do
with all this space?

03:43.885 --> 03:46.990
I'm ready to start a family.
I love kids.

03:47.477 --> 03:51.501
Jim, my husband, he loves them, too,
but I don't know if I'm ready.

03:53.526 --> 03:57.773
Ohh. There is something
wrong with this pump.

04:21.988 --> 04:25.430
I'd hate to tell jordan
there's a problem.

04:26.106 --> 04:28.833
- Why?
- 'Cause he'll try to fix it.

04:28.835 --> 04:31.601
He's great
with music, lousy with tools.

04:31.748 --> 04:35.173
Just, I love this house, and I'm
so glad to be here.

04:35.178 --> 04:37.173
I'm glad
that you're here, too.

04:37.175 --> 04:39.601
Hey, how about you guys
being our first dinner guests?

04:39.605 --> 04:41.850
- Sure. When?
- Tonight.

04:41.865 --> 04:44.113
Nothing big. Just some pasta
and some wine.

04:45.248 --> 04:47.592
Oh. Um, that sounds great.
I'll ask jim.

04:47.598 --> 04:50.101
All right.
Well, cheers to that.

05:01.997 --> 05:04.090
Well,
what do you think?

05:05.418 --> 05:07.690
I think you
look beautiful

05:07.698 --> 05:10.663
But for the record, you looked beautiful
in the first 2 dresses.

05:10.888 --> 05:13.363
The earrings are too much,
aren't they?

05:14.887 --> 05:16.050
No, no. They're fine.

05:16.056 --> 05:17.721
- What's the big deal?
- Oh, it's no big deal

05:17.726 --> 05:21.393
It's just I really like this couple,
and I wanna make a good impression.

05:21.547 --> 05:24.253
Besides, we don't get to go out
with other people much anymore.

05:24.575 --> 05:26.821
No, not since andrea.

05:27.475 --> 05:31.003
- Did you wrap the cake?
- I have wrapped the cake,

05:31.015 --> 05:34.662
and, you know, I solved the global
warming thing while I was waiting.

05:34.666 --> 05:37.060
All right, I'm ready.
I'm sorry.

05:37.067 --> 05:39.540
No, you're right.
We should go out more,

05:39.545 --> 05:43.191
socialize more. Looking forward
to meeting new friends.

05:43.197 --> 05:46.962
- Did I tell you that there's a ghost, too?
- No. You didn't mention that.

05:46.966 --> 05:51.520
Yeah. She's just a child, 6 or 7.
I saw her standing by the pool.

05:51.525 --> 05:55.701
Ok, are you more excited about meeting
new friends or a new ghost?

05:55.705 --> 05:59.721
That's not funny.
She really needs my help.

06:02.768 --> 06:05.220
The earrings are too much.

06:13.148 --> 06:17.591
- Jordan!, come and join us.
- I will, as soon I can.

06:17.606 --> 06:21.753
Wait until you taste jordan's cooking. He
literally could open up his own restaurant.

06:21.755 --> 06:25.833
I fully support that.
Lento's on the square, we're over.

06:27.985 --> 06:30.813
Right, honey?

06:30.825 --> 06:34.190
What? Oh, uh, yes. Grandview is not
exactly the gourmet capital of the world.

06:34.785 --> 06:38.861
- Oh, what kind of music do you guys
like to listen to? - You choose.

06:41.376 --> 06:46.010
This is one of jordan's artists. I want to
listen to it and let me know what you think.

06:49.405 --> 06:52.212
Turn it off!

06:54.596 --> 06:57.312
Um, could you... could you turn
it down just a little bit?

06:57.315 --> 06:58.931
Sure. Of course.

07:01.416 --> 07:04.113
You see, this is what happens
when delia's not around.

07:05.088 --> 07:08.370
- What's going on out there?!
- Be quiet!

07:08.377 --> 07:11.682
- Jordan!?
- Come here!

07:18.365 --> 07:21.502
- This is insane. It won't shut off.
- Got a flashlight?

07:21.508 --> 07:22.990
Maybe we can turn off
the main water supply.

07:23.025 --> 07:26.291
Um, it's in the basement to the left
of the stairs in the entryway.

07:26.296 --> 07:27.992
I see what I can do.

07:29.465 --> 07:32.322
- Where'd the little girl go?
- I'm looking.

07:36.777 --> 07:39.071
Gonna go find the
main circuit breaker.

07:41.355 --> 07:43.431
Go away!

07:44.146 --> 07:47.021
- What's your name, sweetheart?
- Who are you?

07:48.347 --> 07:51.281
- My name is melinda.
- Please be quiet.

07:51.285 --> 07:54.050
My mother's upstairs sleeping.

07:54.056 --> 07:57.030
- She's not upstairs. There's no one up there.
- Yes, she is.

07:57.068 --> 08:01.143
- She's been up there all day.
- It's just you here, but I can help you.

08:05.805 --> 08:08.520
- Found it.
- Melinda, jim, where are you?

08:08.527 --> 08:10.580
Uh, we're in here.

08:12.065 --> 08:16.290
- That was freaky. I am so sorry.
- Well, at least now we have witnesses.

08:16.298 --> 08:18.291
Tell delia we're not
completely insane.

08:20.238 --> 08:22.510
Who the hell is that?

08:28.646 --> 08:31.922
- Hey. Come back here!
- Baby, let him go.

08:36.315 --> 08:38.962
How come we can
all see him?

08:39.707 --> 08:42.292
That one's not a ghost.

08:49.885 --> 08:53.371
It's just so hard not to tell them that
they have a ghost in their house.

08:53.376 --> 08:55.370
Maybe you should.

08:55.375 --> 08:57.841
Oh, but they like us so much.
If I tell them what I can do,

08:57.847 --> 09:02.113
it'll change everything. They'll never look at me the
same, and I definitely don't want delia to know.

09:02.115 --> 09:05.930
Worry about it tomorrow.
Just relax now.

09:05.935 --> 09:09.732
I just keep thinking about that little girl
not wanting the music to wake up her mom.

09:09.738 --> 09:12.290
It's like she's reliving
the day she died.

09:12.296 --> 09:14.462
There's nothing you can
do about it now.

09:14.475 --> 09:17.263
Let it go.

09:17.687 --> 09:22.131
- Go to your quiet place.
- Shut up.

09:22.388 --> 09:25.163
- That does feel nice.
- Aw, you're telling me.

09:25.888 --> 09:28.723
- Why don't you come in with me?
- Because I'm enjoying

09:28.727 --> 09:30.710
the view fine from right here.

09:31.956 --> 09:33.861
Where are you going?

09:33.968 --> 09:36.500
You're out of vino.

09:36.507 --> 09:39.411
- I'll be right back.
- Stay. - 2 minutes.

09:51.808 --> 09:55.773
Make them leave.
They're going to wake my mother.

09:59.856 --> 10:01.850
What happened?

10:01.856 --> 10:05.862
My quiet place just
become a little bit noisy.

10:14.925 --> 10:19.011
Emily morrison, a 6-year-old girl who
died in her family pool.

10:19.018 --> 10:22.840
- How did you find that?
- I ran a news search on the address.

10:22.876 --> 10:25.832
I don't know how a family ever recovers
from something like that.

10:25.865 --> 10:27.531
Yeah. Neither do I.

10:27.576 --> 10:30.540
But the mother and the older brother
were both in the house when it happened.

10:30.585 --> 10:32.401
You think the older brother's
the kid from last night.

10:32.436 --> 10:34.222
He'd be about the right age.

10:34.747 --> 10:38.220
What happened that day?
I mean, why was no one watching her?

10:38.236 --> 10:40.382
Well, we know that the mother
was sleeping upstairs,

10:40.427 --> 10:43.031
which is strange, because the girl
died in the late afternoon.

10:43.067 --> 10:44.882
- Maybe her mom was sick.
- Maybe, but that doesn't

10:44.912 --> 10:47.789
- ... account for the brother.
- Morgan, they need a plumber

10:47.817 --> 10:49.513
- ... relatively young.
- Delia.

10:51.566 --> 10:57.193
There can't possibly be that many stopped-
up toilets between now and thursday.

10:57.587 --> 11:01.231
All right, call me, please,
if anything opens up. Thank you.

11:01.238 --> 11:03.650
I think every plumber
in the entire united states

11:03.657 --> 11:08.342
is actually independently wealthy and they
only take the job just to play with our minds.

11:08.346 --> 11:12.340
Thank you so much for the lamps.
They made the house look beautiful.

11:12.375 --> 11:14.842
- You must be jim.
- Hi. You're delia.

11:15.305 --> 11:17.611
You're still looking for a plumber
for amy and jordan?

11:17.617 --> 11:21.762
Yes, one who specializes in imaginary
drips and phantom spurting faucets.

11:21.795 --> 11:23.722
Got news for you.
It's not imaginary.

11:23.727 --> 11:25.961
Yeah. They had us over
to dinner last night.

11:26.136 --> 11:28.290
- What happened?
- Well, let's just say

11:28.295 --> 11:30.730
it was a very damp
evening overall.

11:30.747 --> 11:34.833
- Who did the plumbing at your house?
- Jim actually did most of it.

11:34.838 --> 11:36.820
- I fixed a few leaks.
- Oh, he's being modest.

11:36.828 --> 11:38.742
He basically overhauled
the whole system.

11:38.787 --> 11:41.873
- Do you want him to take a look?
- Oh, that would be great.

11:41.878 --> 11:44.442
- I really have to get back to work.
- But he'll be off at 4:00.

11:44.445 --> 11:47.962
Really? You are saving my life, jim.
Thank you so much.

11:47.968 --> 11:51.230
- No problem. I'll see you later.
- Anytime.

11:51.895 --> 11:54.191
Whatever happened to,
"you'll never touch another pipe

11:54.195 --> 11:55.170
in our house again?"

11:55.177 --> 11:58.192
I'm sorry. I needed an excuse to get us
back in that house.

11:58.195 --> 12:00.191
Yeah, but what if the pipes are
really damaged?

12:00.195 --> 12:02.611
Well, then we'll jump off that bridge
when we get to it, and there won't be.

12:02.658 --> 12:05.372
This is about ghosts,
not about clogged-up drains.

12:05.418 --> 12:07.783
Lucy, you got some
'splaining to do.

12:07.888 --> 12:11.362
It's gonna be fine.
I promise. I love you.

12:18.016 --> 12:20.310
Are you sure I can't get you
guys something to drink?

12:20.355 --> 12:22.610
- Yeah, sure. I'll, uh-
- No. We're fine. Thank you.

12:22.625 --> 12:25.170
Oh, that's jordan. I have to take it.
The water main's down that way.

12:25.177 --> 12:26.262
Thanks. No problem.

12:26.268 --> 12:28.400
- I was a little thirsty.
- Just-

12:52.027 --> 12:55.591
- hello, emily.
- How come you know my name?

12:55.606 --> 12:57.601
Do you remember mine?
It's melinda.

12:57.607 --> 12:59.952
Don't talk so loud.
You'll wake my mom.

12:59.998 --> 13:02.652
- She's not here.
- Yes, she is.

13:02.657 --> 13:06.902
- When was the last time that you saw her?
- I don't know.

13:07.057 --> 13:09.152
She's not here anymore.
Look, I'll show you.

13:09.157 --> 13:12.643
- Where are you going? No!
- To the bedroom.

13:12.655 --> 13:16.721
She's going to be angry. Jake
says she doesn't want to be bothered.

13:16.725 --> 13:20.811
- Who's jake? Is he your brother?
- Stop.

13:22.197 --> 13:24.752
I'm just trying
to help you.

13:29.766 --> 13:33.792
If you wake her up,
then I'll get the blame.

13:33.798 --> 13:37.873
- There's no one in there.
- Don't go in there.

13:41.458 --> 13:43.681
Melinda?

13:44.417 --> 13:46.511
What are you doing?

13:46.518 --> 13:51.052
Uh, jim wanted me to check the water
pressure in your bathroom. I hope that's ok.

13:51.236 --> 13:54.493
Oh, sure. And when you're done, come join
me in the kitchen. I'm making some coffee.

13:54.498 --> 13:57.083
- Perfect.
- Ok.

14:01.865 --> 14:05.703
- Thank you so much, you guys.
- Sorry I couldn't find much wrong.

14:05.706 --> 14:08.663
Well, I really appreciate you trying.
Maybe it's a good sign.

14:08.665 --> 14:11.061
Well, if you need anything else, give
us a call, and thanks for the coffee.

14:11.077 --> 14:12.071
- Bye now.
- Bye. - Take care.

14:12.935 --> 14:15.682
And just for the record, that was the
best plumbing job I've ever seen.

14:15.687 --> 14:19.013
Copper piping, top-of-the-line fixtures.
Did you find the little girl?

14:19.018 --> 14:22.681
Yeah, but she doesn't know that she's
dead, and it's like she's scared of her mom.

14:22.687 --> 14:25.422
- Did you tell amy about this?
- No, but I did get the name and the number

14:25.427 --> 14:26.423
of the previous owner. I told her it
would help us with the service people.

14:27.827 --> 14:32.500
You should work for the CIA... Angela
Morrison... What good does that do us?

14:32.548 --> 14:35.352
That's the mom, you know,
and i have to talk to her.

14:35.385 --> 14:37.730
She's gonna know what
happened that day. Bye.

15:03.866 --> 15:06.262
- Oh, hi. Can I help you?
- I hope so.

15:06.267 --> 15:10.341
Some friends of mine moved in
to your old house on gardner.

15:10.347 --> 15:14.462
Oh, amy and jordan. Nice people.
So, are they settling in ok?

15:14.466 --> 15:18.841
Actually, they're having some weird problems
with the plumbing and electrical system.

15:18.845 --> 15:20.930
Really? 'Cause we just
put in all brand-new-

15:20.935 --> 15:22.772
yeah. Copper pipes. I know.

15:23.726 --> 15:26.012
Um, that's not really
what I'm here to talk about.

15:26.027 --> 15:27.023
Sorry?

15:27.745 --> 15:31.321
When you lived there,
did you feel a presence?

15:33.327 --> 15:37.611
- What sort of a presence?
- Like a spirit.

15:38.236 --> 15:40.243
What are you
talking about?

15:40.835 --> 15:44.071
I know that you lost your
daughter, and I'm so sorry.

15:45.606 --> 15:49.273
Are you trying to tell me
that the new owners

15:49.276 --> 15:52.970
think that my daughter
is haunting their house?

15:53.016 --> 15:55.622
No. I don't think
they know what happened.

15:55.927 --> 15:57.972
But you do.

15:57.985 --> 16:01.321
I know that there was
an accident in the pool.

16:02.367 --> 16:05.313
My daughter died,

16:06.918 --> 16:11.340
and it was a terrible time, and I've
worked very, very hard

16:11.388 --> 16:12.373
to put it behind me
and to move on.

16:12.405 --> 16:18.771
It wasn't easy, but I'm at peace with
it now, and when I think of her,

16:18.926 --> 16:21.901
I know that she's in a better place.

16:23.638 --> 16:26.693
She may not be
in a better place.

16:27.237 --> 16:29.623
I don't really understand
what you want.

16:29.628 --> 16:31.420
I don't want anything.

16:31.806 --> 16:36.501
I just want you to consider the possibility
that maybe your daughter hasn't moved on,

16:36.795 --> 16:38.851
that there might be
something keeping her here.

16:38.858 --> 16:41.762
She was a very happy
little girl.

16:41.795 --> 16:45.421
We lived a very good life
until that day.

16:46.248 --> 16:50.722
- Look, I have a lot of work to do, so...
- Of course.

16:52.397 --> 16:54.430
J ake?

16:58.157 --> 17:01.141
I guess you can
tell my mother's a little nuts.

17:01.146 --> 17:05.142
No, I don't think she's nuts. I think she
just believes in what makes her feel better.

17:05.147 --> 17:07.711
How come you're
so interested in my family?

17:07.717 --> 17:10.540
I don't like to know
that people are hurting.

17:10.546 --> 17:13.942
I saw you the other night
at the house.

17:13.948 --> 17:17.161
I know. Thanks for
not ratting me out.

17:17.166 --> 17:18.803
You're welcome.

17:19.108 --> 17:23.791
I know what you mean, when you
were talking about a presence.

17:26.285 --> 17:29.771
I think she's
still there, too... Emily.

17:29.977 --> 17:34.022
- Why would you say that?
- I saw her.

17:51.896 --> 17:53.953
Emily!

17:56.416 --> 17:58.111
Take it easy, honey.

17:59.888 --> 18:01.980
- I know.
- But she's right there.

18:07.975 --> 18:10.370
I know it sounds crazy, but...

18:11.188 --> 18:12.820
I saw her.

18:13.717 --> 18:15.752
I know you did.

18:16.347 --> 18:17.753
You do?

18:17.796 --> 18:22.971
Yeah, lots of kids see spirits,
kind of grow out of it over time.

18:23.006 --> 18:26.110
Sometimes I thought
I was crazy.

18:26.116 --> 18:30.180
- Yeah. I know the feeling.
- You see ghosts?

18:30.348 --> 18:32.690
- Yes.
- You've seen my sister?

18:32.696 --> 18:37.063
- Yes.
- So is she all right?

18:38.028 --> 18:41.590
She's stuck here, jake.

18:42.206 --> 18:47.322
I don't think she knows that she's dead, but
we have to make this our little secret, ok?

18:47.738 --> 18:49.930
Can you tell me
where your father is now?

18:49.935 --> 18:52.085
He got married again.

18:52.085 --> 18:56.583
He has new kids and everything.
He moved out of grandview.

18:56.585 --> 18:58.772
You've had it tough,
haven't you?

18:58.885 --> 19:01.130
Can I talk to my sister?

19:01.676 --> 19:04.450
I have to tell her
I'm sorry.

19:04.457 --> 19:06.461
Sorry about what?

19:08.108 --> 19:10.483
Sorry.

19:26.346 --> 19:29.053
Do you hear that?

19:29.725 --> 19:34.330
- What?
- That. It sounds like an animal.

19:41.708 --> 19:43.980
Jordan, come here.

19:50.416 --> 19:53.312
That's strange.

20:08.255 --> 20:10.893
What the hell?

20:31.066 --> 20:33.100
I have a little
emergency on my hands.

20:33.108 --> 20:36.280
Do you have scented candles
or bubble bath?

20:36.525 --> 20:38.520
I do. Are you planning
a romantic evening?

20:38.726 --> 20:43.172
With who, tivo? No, I have to get
a gift for amy and jordan.

20:43.207 --> 20:44.680
They're staying
at the grandview regent.

20:44.688 --> 20:47.681
- What? Why?
- You know, I didn't get the whole story.

20:47.685 --> 20:49.771
It's something
about the pool now.

20:49.778 --> 20:52.603
Anyway, it'd be great if you could
just make up a little gift basket.

20:52.605 --> 20:54.542
Wow, you really take
care of your clients.

20:57.957 --> 20:59.673
But I'm gonna sort
the whole thing out.

20:59.678 --> 21:03.721
- You're not gonna get rich that way.
- Yeah, but I sleep good at night.

21:06.788 --> 21:08.991
- Do you have some time?
- Maybe.

21:08.997 --> 21:11.480
I need to run across the street.
Would you mind watching the store?

21:11.488 --> 21:13.773
Are you kidding?
I would love to.

21:15.746 --> 21:17.551
W- wait. Wh-what if
somebody comes in?

21:18.058 --> 21:20.072
Sell them the birdbath.

21:27.175 --> 21:29.170
What are you doing here?

21:29.186 --> 21:31.242
I want you to take me
to my sister.

21:31.248 --> 21:34.500
I thought all the keys had to be
returned to the real-estate person.

21:34.558 --> 21:38.111
- Nobody ever asked me for mine.
- That would be breaking in.

21:39.447 --> 21:42.013
If you're not gonna take me,
I can go by myself.

21:42.015 --> 21:43.872
Jake, stop.

21:43.957 --> 21:47.983
You have to tell me what happened
that day, the day that she died.

21:48.028 --> 21:49.601
Then will you take me?

21:49.605 --> 21:53.642
I can't promise,
but you have to trust me.

22:00.495 --> 22:02.562
My dad was at work.

22:02.565 --> 22:05.743
He asked me to watch
emily after school.

22:05.748 --> 22:10.611
She asked me if I wanted to play, but
I was in the middle of a video game.

22:10.615 --> 22:13.322
I told her to wait
until I was finished.

22:13.327 --> 22:15.503
She said she was gonna
complain to my mom.

22:15.507 --> 22:19.713
I told her mom was asleep and she'd
be angry if emily bothered her.

22:21.308 --> 22:25.312
- Your mom was sleeping in the afternoon?
- She slept a lot.

22:25.758 --> 22:28.001
My parents were
having problems.

22:28.006 --> 22:32.031
The night before, my mom asked
my father to move out.

22:32.356 --> 22:37.150
She was afraid to tell emily.
Emily was really close to my father.

22:38.376 --> 22:40.223
Anyway...

22:40.628 --> 22:44.943
I finished my video game, and when
I looked up. My sister was gone.

22:45.638 --> 22:50.223
I has this really bad feeling,
like my insides were cold.

22:53.297 --> 22:57.842
Emily! Emily!
Mom! Mom! I need you!

22:57.848 --> 23:01.020
Come on! Emily!
I just- I lost it.

23:01.025 --> 23:06.322
I'm so sorry! Please come back!
Please, emily! I'm so sorry!

23:09.037 --> 23:11.350
And what happened
after that?

23:11.356 --> 23:13.780
I don't remember.

23:17.688 --> 23:21.050
Now will you please
take me there?

23:32.146 --> 23:35.302
Jake!
Jake, you came to see me.

23:35.337 --> 23:37.423
I thought
you were mad at me.

23:37.427 --> 23:40.613
- Jake, your sister's here.
- What?

23:40.715 --> 23:45.243
- Where?
- Right here. Why won't you look at me?

23:45.245 --> 23:49.361
- Jake! Jake!
- Wait. What's going on?

23:49.408 --> 23:54.380
- Why won't he talk to me?
- Emily, he can't see you.

23:57.568 --> 24:00.562
Why not?
What's wrong with him?

24:00.568 --> 24:02.822
- Do you know what happened to you?
- When?

24:02.825 --> 24:05.523
The day that you
asked jake to play.

24:06.187 --> 24:10.213
He wouldn't come,
so I went to play by myself.

24:19.578 --> 24:21.572
- You fell in?
- Yeah.

24:21.915 --> 24:23.912
Then what happened?

24:23.915 --> 24:27.673
I went to sleep
under the water.

24:28.216 --> 24:31.462
Do you remember
waking up?

24:33.138 --> 24:36.590
The truth is
you never woke up.

24:37.735 --> 24:43.340
You died that day, and that's why
no one can see you or hear you.

24:43.645 --> 24:47.671
- But you do. Did you die, too?
- No.

24:47.676 --> 24:50.291
No. I can see you
so that I can help you...

24:50.296 --> 24:53.191
go to another place
where you'll be very happy.

24:53.208 --> 24:57.310
But I'm happy here with my mom
and dad. He's coming home soon.

24:57.948 --> 25:01.581
- No, sweetie, he's not.
- Yes, he is.

25:01.596 --> 25:06.583
Emily, your daddy doesn't live here
anymore. Neither does your mommy.

25:07.346 --> 25:11.591
Tell her, jake. Daddy's coming home,
and he's gonna read me

25:11.637 --> 25:15.772
goodnight moon and tuck
me in, me first, then you.

25:15.786 --> 25:20.380
- Tell her.
- That's what I've been waiting for.

25:33.325 --> 25:38.381
- What are you doing here?
- I'm sorry. This is jake morrison.

25:38.387 --> 25:41.461
He used to live here with his family
before you bought the house.

25:41.478 --> 25:44.641
- How did you get in?
- Because he still has a key,

25:44.678 --> 25:48.601
and he wanted to return it,
just see the place again,

25:48.606 --> 25:51.660
and I hoped that
you wouldn't mind.

26:00.307 --> 26:03.460
- Awkward.
- Slightly

26:03.725 --> 26:07.170
- Is my sister really there?
- Yes, jake.

26:07.177 --> 26:10.541
She's waiting for your father
to come home, to read to her,

26:10.546 --> 26:12.493
and he has to finish that story.

26:12.575 --> 26:16.473
"Goodnight moon"
He used to read it to me, too.

26:16.478 --> 26:19.803
Do you think we can get him
to come and see her?

26:20.358 --> 26:24.351
- Mm, I don't think so.
- Well, can't you call him?

26:24.386 --> 26:28.431
Well, he works a lot,
and he's working on

26:28.437 --> 26:34.140
a big house on route 59, and he's
in charge, so he's really busy.

26:34.585 --> 26:38.851
Well, this is kind of important... I
mean, don't you think he'll understand?

26:38.887 --> 26:42.661
He has a new family.
I don't see him too much.

26:43.025 --> 26:47.131
- But don't you at least speak?
- Not too much.

26:50.358 --> 26:57.323
Look, jake, um, my father
left when I was very young,

26:58.326 --> 27:02.883
and I didn't know why,
but I was heartbroken.

27:04.095 --> 27:08.551
And then out of the blue, he'd come back,
maybe for a day, maybe for a week.

27:08.555 --> 27:11.751
Sometimes he'd
bring gifts for me.

27:12.975 --> 27:15.473
Then he'd be gone again.

27:15.666 --> 27:18.840
I didn't know which was worse,
hardly ever getting to see him

27:18.886 --> 27:22.212
or having to say good-bye
to him over and over again.

27:22.217 --> 27:26.581
And I never wore the gifts he gave me,
'cause I knew it would make my mom really mad.

27:26.798 --> 27:29.801
She didn't want me
to see him or talk to him.

27:31.435 --> 27:34.230
I was too young to
understand, so...

27:34.236 --> 27:37.633
I wondered if all
of this was my fault,

27:38.098 --> 27:40.342
did I do something
to make him leave,

27:40.345 --> 27:44.820
you know, was there something then I
could have done to have made him stay.

27:44.857 --> 27:48.901
- What happened?
- He came by less and less, and...

27:50.367 --> 27:52.960
finally I never
saw him again.

27:54.088 --> 27:58.930
It was really unfair, because I thought
that I had the power to keep him there,

27:58.936 --> 28:02.042
- ... if only I knew how.
- Did you?

28:02.996 --> 28:07.971
- Did you have the power?
- No, I didn'T.

28:07.978 --> 28:12.763
- And neither do you.
- If I had saved emily...

28:14.777 --> 28:17.800
he would've come back.

28:19.576 --> 28:21.570
But I didn'T.

28:21.577 --> 28:25.633
Jake, you don't think that your
father blames that on you, do you?

28:25.857 --> 28:29.403
- Yeah.
- Oh, why would you say that?

28:29.576 --> 28:31.762
I gotta go.

28:31.776 --> 28:35.110
My mom's probably wondering
where I am, anyway.

28:42.158 --> 28:46.471
- You did what?
- I'll admit it. I took a chance.

28:46.485 --> 28:48.882
I thought amy
would be at the hotel.

28:48.926 --> 28:52.381
- Mel... - I know. It's just
there's so much at stake for this kid.

28:52.398 --> 28:56.692
He's in so much pain,
Jim, seems so alone.

28:56.696 --> 28:59.783
And he's a great kid,
really smart.

28:59.788 --> 29:02.191
I just don't understand
why his father would ignore him.

29:02.198 --> 29:04.972
You know, parents are
supposed to be there for their kids.

29:05.278 --> 29:08.260
I've never seen that.
It's pretty.

29:08.307 --> 29:11.402
It's been in my
jewelry box forever.

29:13.586 --> 29:17.003
Well, you have a huge heart.
That's why I love you.

29:17.005 --> 29:21.010
But you're not a social worker.
You've done everything you could.

29:21.736 --> 29:25.321
Not everything.

29:57.848 --> 30:01.133
I know that your family business is
private and none of my concern.

30:01.138 --> 30:02.703
Then why did
you come here?

30:02.707 --> 30:04.902
Because I've gotten to
know jake a little bit.

30:04.946 --> 30:08.771
He's a special kid, and he's having
a really hard time right now.

30:08.957 --> 30:10.951
What do you mean?

30:11.177 --> 30:15.730
He thinks that his sister's spirit
is still in the house on gardner.

30:15.867 --> 30:17.881
- Do you believe him?
- That's not important.

30:17.886 --> 30:20.420
What is important
is that he believes it.

30:20.518 --> 30:24.120
Yeah, well, kids find
different ways of coping.

30:24.135 --> 30:31.223
I'm sorry.
Uh, who are you again?

30:31.235 --> 30:35.823
Look, I'm just trying to help, but I think
that jake feels like he can't talk to you.

30:36.927 --> 30:39.193
So you're an expert
on my son's feelings.

30:39.197 --> 30:42.533
No, but I do know what it feels like
to be abandoned by a parent.

30:42.798 --> 30:45.622
He feels like you replaced him
with a new family.

30:45.627 --> 30:47.890
- That's ridiculous.
- Is it?

30:47.905 --> 30:50.381
Do you know that he thinks that you
blame him for what happened to emily?

30:50.385 --> 30:54.350
Look, I don't know who you are coming
here and... have you ever lost a child?

30:54.396 --> 30:56.341
- No.
- Do you even have children?

30:56.386 --> 30:59.440
- No.
- I didn't think so.

31:02.328 --> 31:04.273
Look, jake and me,
we had a code.

31:04.306 --> 31:06.220
When his mother
asked me to leave,

31:06.228 --> 31:12.182
I told him that if
he ever needed me,

31:12.187 --> 31:12.212
if there ever was a problem, that he should
page me with a 911 text, and I'd be there.

31:12.246 --> 31:14.862
And did he do it
when emily drowned?

31:14.868 --> 31:16.862
No.

31:16.865 --> 31:21.400
- Do you blame him?
- I-I never said anything like that to him.

31:21.406 --> 31:23.731
You don't have to.
He feels it.

31:23.827 --> 31:27.032
Well, I don't want him
to feel that.

31:29.307 --> 31:32.790
I don't wanna feel that.

31:35.838 --> 31:38.710
She was my little girl.

31:39.346 --> 31:41.622
She was perfect.

31:42.637 --> 31:46.533
And jake, he was a rock-solid kid.
He was a championship swimmer,

31:46.538 --> 31:48.832
he was right there, and...

31:52.435 --> 31:58.200
Angela found her way of moving
on, and, uh, I found mine, ok?

31:58.488 --> 32:02.483
I love jake, and he
knows that deep down.

32:02.665 --> 32:07.451
A- and you were right the first time.
This is none of your business.

32:30.026 --> 32:32.021
Melinda!

32:33.738 --> 32:37.730
I never got to apologize for leaving
you in the store so long yesterday.

32:37.735 --> 32:39.893
Oh, don't worry about it.
I had a ball.

32:40.425 --> 32:44.822
So was there some kind of weird parallel
universe thing going on yesterday?

32:44.925 --> 32:47.622
- What do you mean?
- Well, I take over the store,

32:47.627 --> 32:51.362
and you show a house
to a 12-year-old.

32:51.367 --> 32:54.640
Yeah. Look, I'm-
I'm so sorry about that.

32:54.686 --> 32:57.663
Melinda, what were you thinking
letting that kid into amy's house?

32:57.665 --> 33:00.083
She was all over me
about it last night.

33:00.088 --> 33:02.101
I'm sorry. He used
to live there, and-

33:02.136 --> 33:03.510
anyway, it doesn't matter.
They're selling.

33:03.516 --> 33:06.153
- They are?
- Yeah. It's a big mess.

33:06.215 --> 33:08.831
They think the house
I sold them was haunted.

33:08.836 --> 33:11.700
Is that the most brain-dead
thing you ever heard or what?

33:11.736 --> 33:15.850
Just about... Um, could
you just hold them off?

33:15.888 --> 33:18.190
'Cause maybe if I can get the
family that used to live there

33:18.196 --> 33:21.690
to just come back for a few hours,
we could fix the things that aren't working.

33:21.726 --> 33:23.811
- How would they do that?
- Just trust me.

33:23.817 --> 33:27.822
If you could get amy's permission, maybe
I can get this whole thing cleared up.

33:27.917 --> 33:30.990
- Ok. I'll try to get the key.
- Thanks.

33:30.996 --> 33:34.491
- Aren't you opening the store?
- Oh, um, later.

33:34.525 --> 33:38.841
I have a quick errand to run.
Bye.

33:38.958 --> 33:41.851
That is one sweet job.

34:08.935 --> 34:11.650
- You have some nerve coming here.
- Sorry?

34:11.656 --> 34:14.942
Did you actually tell my son that
you could see his sister's ghost

34:14.945 --> 34:18.052
and that she's living
in my old house?

34:18.097 --> 34:20.830
- Yes, I did tell him that.
- Why would you do that?

34:20.835 --> 34:24.440
- He's just a little boy.
- Because it's true.

34:25.348 --> 34:27.431
My daughter is gone.

34:27.437 --> 34:30.440
She's in a better place.
She's at peace.

34:30.456 --> 34:34.871
No, she's not. She needs to see her
father, and you have to help her do that.

34:34.875 --> 34:37.280
Her father, the man
who cheated on me.

34:37.447 --> 34:40.501
This is not about what your husband
did or didn't do to you.

34:40.505 --> 34:42.530
It's about
your daughter's needs.

34:42.536 --> 34:44.532
Mom.

34:44.878 --> 34:47.252
She's telling the truth..

34:47.436 --> 34:50.670
I felt emily.
She's in that house.

34:50.687 --> 34:53.851
Please, jake, I don't
wanna hear this anymore.

34:53.856 --> 34:56.601
And I want you to stop
telling my son lies,

34:56.647 --> 35:00.700
and I want you to stop defiling
the memory of my little angel

35:00.745 --> 35:02.350
Stop it!

35:02.357 --> 35:06.290
She is not a little angel.
She's not in a better place.

35:06.305 --> 35:09.843
- She's still in that house. I know it.
- Come here.

35:54.457 --> 35:58.502
- How you doing, jake?
- Ok, dad.

36:00.918 --> 36:03.741
You?

36:04.545 --> 36:07.961
- Good to see you, angela.
- Right.

36:07.966 --> 36:10.240
Well, let's all go inside.

36:24.755 --> 36:26.753
Brings back
lots of memories.

36:26.818 --> 36:27.831
Some good ones, I hope.

36:27.867 --> 36:30.100
I really don't understand
what we're doing here.

36:30.196 --> 36:32.112
Just listen, mom.

36:34.238 --> 36:36.600
- What was that?
- Your daughter.

36:36.607 --> 36:39.843
Daddy, you're home!

36:39.846 --> 36:42.491
Daddy, I'm right
down here!

36:42.496 --> 36:47.113
Sweetie, remember that he can't
see you and he can't hear you.

36:47.116 --> 36:49.152
Only I can, but I'll tell him
whatever you wanna say.

36:49.156 --> 36:51.420
I- I don't know what kind
of parlor trick you're pulling,

36:51.435 --> 36:53.762
but y-you can't be
talking to emily. You just can't be.

36:53.797 --> 36:57.082
- Dad!
- Why is he calling me emily?

36:57.088 --> 36:59.510
She wants to know why
you're calling her emily.

36:59.516 --> 37:03.062
You always called her
little bunny.

37:06.746 --> 37:10.782
- You told her that.
- Didn't tell her anything, I swear.

37:13.018 --> 37:17.760
Tell her I'm sorry.
Tell her I'm sorry I didn't save her.

37:17.767 --> 37:21.123
You tried hard, jake.

37:21.127 --> 37:24.441
- She says that you tried to save her.
- What?

37:26.415 --> 37:29.491
I remember now.

37:34.265 --> 37:39.561
I couldn't breathe.
I was just falling and falling.

37:39.565 --> 37:41.861
Then I saw jake.

37:41.868 --> 37:46.523
He was trying to drag me up,
but I was so scared.

37:46.536 --> 37:51.982
I was holding on too tight.
I was dragging him down with me.

37:51.988 --> 37:54.310
He tried so hard.

38:00.196 --> 38:04.252
You would drown, too,
if you tried any harder.

38:04.548 --> 38:07.202
You tried so hard...

38:08.137 --> 38:12.153
But you would have drowned, too,
if you had tried any harder.

38:12.686 --> 38:16.733
- I tried to save her?
- You did.

38:18.687 --> 38:21.022
Is that true, jake?

38:21.026 --> 38:24.852
- Why didn't you tell me?
- I didn't remember.

38:24.855 --> 38:26.862
He was in shock.

38:28.608 --> 38:32.103
Tell daddy he shouldn't
be mad at jake anymore.

38:32.106 --> 38:35.063
She doesn't want you to be mad
at jake anymore.

38:35.068 --> 38:38.682
I- I'm not mad at your brother, bunny.
I never was. Tell her.

38:38.685 --> 38:41.111
She's with us.
She can hear you.

38:41.125 --> 38:43.490
I was mad at myself.

38:44.848 --> 38:48.112
I wasn't there for you,

38:48.118 --> 38:51.372
for either of you.

38:51.976 --> 38:55.122
I was doing things
that I, uh, shouldn't have been doing,

38:55.646 --> 38:57.652
and I hurt your mom,

38:58.096 --> 39:00.502
and I hurt our family.

39:01.417 --> 39:04.112
I hurt us, too.

39:04.756 --> 39:10.182
I let your father take the blame,
but it was my fault, too.

39:10.185 --> 39:11.890
I should have
been watching you.

39:11.897 --> 39:15.772
I should have pulled it together and
not locked myself up in my bedroom.

39:19.777 --> 39:24.731
The important thing is is that
you know this wasn't your fault.

39:25.765 --> 39:32.921
I just couldn't stand the loss, and
I never meant for you to feel it, too.

39:32.928 --> 39:36.043
That's why I felt that you were
better off without me.

39:37.465 --> 39:40.860
Both of you.

39:40.867 --> 39:43.901
I lost my family
because of what I did,

39:43.906 --> 39:46.831
not because of
what anybody else did.

39:46.837 --> 39:50.901
Tell daddy he didn't
lose his family.

39:51.057 --> 39:57.183
Jake is your family.
He needs you. He always will.

39:57.757 --> 40:00.140
She says that you didn't
lose your family...

40:00.876 --> 40:04.322
Jake needs you,
and he always will.

40:08.206 --> 40:11.213
I'm so sorry, jake.

40:15.327 --> 40:19.381
I'll never let you go again.
I promise you, ok?

40:30.588 --> 40:33.100
I'm sorry I hurt you.

40:36.578 --> 40:40.092
I want daddy
to finish the story now.

40:40.097 --> 40:44.291
She wants to know if you'll finish
reading "goodnight moon"

40:44.296 --> 40:47.423
She's waited
a long time.

41:02.326 --> 41:07.403
- He was up to, "goodnight stars. "
- You were up to, "goodnight stars. "

41:10.266 --> 41:14.840
"Goodnight stars. "
"Goodnight air. "

41:20.136 --> 41:23.630
"Goodnight noises everywhere. "

41:29.865 --> 41:35.092
- Hi, nana.
- Uh, wait.

41:35.576 --> 41:39.890
- Ok, I will.
- She wants me to come with her.

41:39.906 --> 41:42.790
She's ready to go now.

41:43.966 --> 41:47.152
Tell mommy and daddy
I'm gonna like it there.

41:47.158 --> 41:51.572
Nana says so.
Tell them I love them.

41:51.577 --> 41:53.763
I will.

41:53.768 --> 41:59.761
I'm sorry I got you in trouble.
I didn't mean it.

42:13.317 --> 42:16.502
Goodnight, little bunny.

42:21.016 --> 42:23.880
I can feel her.

42:23.897 --> 42:27.091
She's happy now.

42:35.197 --> 42:37.212
Oh, sweetie.

42:40.525 --> 42:43.220
I don't know
how to thank you.

42:43.538 --> 42:46.053
You already have.
