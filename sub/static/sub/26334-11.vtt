09:22.300 --> 09:24.999

"Now, I know

I'm not supposed to say anything
about this to you..."

09:26.870 --> 09:28.959
"But if I don't,
I'm gonna explode."

09:29.003 --> 09:32.223
Turns out, Vivian told
her that she's seeing

09:32.267 --> 09:33.921
this shrink, Dr. Dornan,

09:33.964 --> 09:36.271
because she's had it
up to here with me,

09:36.314 --> 09:39.230
and, uh, she wants to do
what's best for Sophia.

09:39.274 --> 09:40.797
Meaning?

09:40.841 --> 09:43.495
Meaning that she's gonna
move away with Sophia.

09:43.539 --> 09:45.019
Well, she can't do that
without your permission.

09:45.062 --> 09:46.629
Yeah, you think
that's gonna stop her?

09:46.673 --> 09:48.065
Just the other day,
Sophia told me

09:48.109 --> 09:49.676
how much her mother's
been talking about

09:49.719 --> 09:52.504
how she's sick
of these New York winters.

09:52.548 --> 09:54.071
So I-I went

09:54.115 --> 09:56.552
to ask Dr. Dornan.

09:56.596 --> 09:58.554
Well, Anthony,
any shrink worth her salt

09:58.598 --> 10:00.948
is not going to violate
confidentiality

10:00.991 --> 10:03.864
to an ex-husband,
especially to an ex-husband.

10:03.907 --> 10:07.868
Someone wants to stop me
from seeing my daughter?

10:07.911 --> 10:11.306
I'm gonna do
whatever the hell it takes.

if I can even get those.

10:36.592 --> 10:37.724
I mean,
taxi business

10:37.767 --> 10:39.029
has got one foot in the grave

10:39.073 --> 10:40.291
with all these rideshare apps.

10:40.335 --> 10:41.684
The disruption economy.

10:41.728 --> 10:42.903
Yeah, destruction
is more like it.

10:42.946 --> 10:44.687
Five years ago,
I spent

10:44.731 --> 10:46.210
$1.5 million buying
my taxi medallion.

10:47.777 --> 10:51.433
It's worth a quarter
of that now.

10:51.476 --> 10:52.564
My life goes in the crapper,

10:52.608 --> 10:55.393
my wife walks out.

10:55.437 --> 10:58.266
I had a few too many last night,

10:58.309 --> 11:00.007
forgot my wallet this morning.

11:02.400 --> 11:04.707
Well, go out, get your
registration renewed,

11:04.751 --> 11:06.970
leave that gun at home
from now on, all right?

11:07.014 --> 11:09.451
A

11:09.494 --> 11:10.495
What the Taxi
and Limousine Commission

11:10.539 --> 11:11.583
doesn't know won't hurt 'em.

11:13.760 --> 11:14.761
I really appreciate it.
Thank you.

11:19.896 --> 11:22.682
Hey, you related
to Frank Reagan?

11:22.725 --> 11:23.987
Yeah, he's my dad.

11:24.031 --> 11:26.816
Get out of here.
He was my sergeant back in '84

11:26.860 --> 11:28.688
at the Six-Five.
It'd be nice to catch up.

11:28.731 --> 11:30.907
Do one better, call him.
I think he'd like that.

11:30.951 --> 11:34.302
I really appreciate you
cutting me a break.

11:34.345 --> 11:36.217
Tell your dad I said hi.All right.

11:41.701 --> 11:43.615
Hey, you sure about not

11:43.659 --> 11:45.269
telling TLC?

11:45.313 --> 11:47.489
They're kind of strict about
their drivers not carrying.

11:47.532 --> 11:49.012
Like he needs more problems?

11:53.669 --> 11:55.932
DANNY:
Sean, dinner's here.

11:55.976 --> 11:57.891
Ah.

11:57.934 --> 12:01.764
Nothing like pizza to make
a bad day better, huh?

12:01.808 --> 12:03.070
First you got to ruin my life,

12:03.113 --> 12:04.462
then you got to ruin
my appetite.

12:04.506 --> 12:05.768
Come on, what are you
talking about?

12:05.812 --> 12:09.250
Come on, out with it.
I want to know

12:09.293 --> 12:11.034
what are you
talking about.

12:11.078 --> 12:13.471
Jennifer unfollowed me
on Instagram and Twitter

12:13.515 --> 12:14.777
and just about everything else.

12:14.821 --> 12:15.996
Why?

12:16.039 --> 12:18.172
Her dad thinks
I'm a bad influence.

12:18.215 --> 12:19.826
You're the bad influence?

12:19.869 --> 12:22.045
:
Okay, you see,

12:22.089 --> 12:24.918
I thought you told me that it
was her idea to come over here

12:24.961 --> 12:26.963
and play house with you
while I wasn't home,

12:27.007 --> 12:28.225
not the other way around.

12:28.269 --> 12:30.619
Is that right?
Right.

12:30.662 --> 12:32.839
So why don't you call her on the
phone, have her put her old man

12:32.882 --> 12:34.101
on the phone and I'll
straighten it out.
No! Dad.

12:34.144 --> 12:35.102
Call her and I'm gonna
have you put her...

12:35.145 --> 12:36.364
Wow. I don't think you get it.

12:37.931 --> 12:39.715
Her dad thinks that
I'm a bad influence

12:39.759 --> 12:41.717
because he thinks that
you're a bad influence.

12:41.761 --> 12:44.024
Me?
Yeah, you.

12:44.067 --> 12:45.939
That's why I can't
see her anymore.

12:45.982 --> 12:50.030
So why don't you just
stay out of it. God!

12:56.819 --> 12:58.734
Madeline is dead?

12:58.778 --> 13:00.170
ABETEMARCO:
I'm sorry.

13:00.214 --> 13:02.869
Docs said she lost too much
blood at the scene.

13:02.912 --> 13:06.350
She's been with me for 10 years.

13:06.394 --> 13:09.484
She was scared of Graham
from the day he arrived,

13:09.527 --> 13:10.920
but I promised her
she'd be safe.

13:10.964 --> 13:12.443
Graham his first or last name?

13:12.487 --> 13:14.576
Uh, first, Graham Baxter.

13:16.186 --> 13:18.232
I wish I could tell you more.

13:18.275 --> 13:21.801
Doc, this is no time to play
footsie over confidentiality.

13:21.844 --> 13:23.193
He's my patient.

13:23.237 --> 13:24.629
The man clearly poses a threat.

13:27.241 --> 13:29.634
Graham came to me
a-a few months ago,

13:29.678 --> 13:31.201
saying he knew

13:31.245 --> 13:32.899
people were plotting
against him.

13:32.942 --> 13:34.161
Even you and Madeline?

13:34.204 --> 13:37.164
You can't blame him.

13:37.207 --> 13:40.210
Schizophrenia can overwhelm
even the most rational person.

13:40.254 --> 13:43.344
Yeah, well, nuts or not,
he needs to be caught.

13:43.387 --> 13:45.563
Why would he take files?

13:45.607 --> 13:47.957
Recently, he started to fixate

13:48.001 --> 13:50.830
on

13:50.873 --> 13:52.657
Which other patients?I don't, I don't know.

13:52.701 --> 13:54.181
Doc, who else is he going after?

13:55.356 --> 13:56.836
Anthony, what are you doing?

14:01.884 --> 14:03.843
Perp's an EDP
named Graham Baxter,

14:03.886 --> 14:05.018
and he's not done.

14:05.061 --> 14:06.497
Yeah, we know.

14:06.541 --> 14:08.630
He stabbed someone in
Murray Hill about an hour go.

14:08.673 --> 14:09.892
Must be one of her patients

14:09.936 --> 14:11.198
because he stole
a bunch of files.

14:11.241 --> 14:13.069
Okay, relax, I'm on the case.Who are you?

14:13.113 --> 14:15.680
Detective Fleming.
Detective Washburn.

14:15.724 --> 14:18.248
NYPD is on this, Anthony.

14:18.292 --> 14:20.729
If he's got a bunch of patient
files, she could be on his list.

14:20.772 --> 14:22.296
Who is "she"?None of your business!

14:22.339 --> 14:24.515
Hey, pal, I'm not your enemy.You're lucky about that!

14:24.559 --> 14:28.606
All right, enough! His ex-wife
is one of Dr. Dornan's patients.

14:28.650 --> 14:30.434
And if this psycho
has her address,

14:30.478 --> 14:34.351
she's at risk, as is my daughter
Sophia. So now you get it, pal?

14:34.395 --> 14:36.919
If he does, then I'll
make sure that she's safe.

14:36.963 --> 14:39.269
What's your clearance rate?We are going.

14:39.313 --> 14:41.271
I'm just trying to make sure.

14:41.315 --> 14:44.884
The correct answer is,
"Right away, boss." Let's go.

14:52.979 --> 14:56.765
Next name on Dr. Dornan's list
is, uh, Ted Morgan.

14:56.808 --> 14:58.636
Baxter took that one.

14:58.680 --> 15:00.595
Hey, Fleming.Hey, what are you doing here?

15:00.638 --> 15:01.944
Find out which
patients this maniac

15:01.988 --> 15:02.858
might be going
after next?

15:02.902 --> 15:04.077
Only thing I'm finding right now

15:04.120 --> 15:05.556
is a guy contaminating
my crime scene.

15:05.600 --> 15:07.210
Relax. I'm here to help.

15:07.254 --> 15:09.038
Only thing I needed from you
was your statement.

15:09.082 --> 15:10.648
Oh, so you've collared
Baxter already?

15:10.692 --> 15:13.608
Yeah, exactly.
Let me take a look...

15:13.651 --> 15:16.480
Hey, get your hands off of me
and your ass out of here.

15:16.524 --> 15:18.439
Hey, what the hell's
your problem?I don't have one.

15:18.482 --> 15:20.745
And neither does your boss
with me doing my job.

15:20.789 --> 15:22.747
'Course if you
had done yours,

15:22.791 --> 15:24.749
then Baxter would've never
gotten out that door, and

15:24.793 --> 15:27.187
your ex wouldn't have a check
beside her name on my list.

15:27.230 --> 15:29.841
Vivian's file was taken?

15:29.885 --> 15:31.408
And rest easy 'cause
there's a radio car

15:31.452 --> 15:33.019
headed to her
place right now.

15:33.062 --> 15:34.629
Come on, come on,
pick up, pick up.

15:34.672 --> 15:36.457
Hey, I don't want to see you
again, Abetemarco.

15:36.500 --> 15:37.893
Pick up! Vivian, pick up!

15:41.157 --> 15:44.378
I found out who called them
that you were here.

15:44.421 --> 15:45.857
One of our grill guys.

15:45.901 --> 15:48.077
I let him go.

15:48.121 --> 15:51.907
And why did you just stand by
and let them harass us?

15:51.951 --> 15:53.909
It all happened so fast.

15:53.953 --> 15:55.998
Saying "get out" happens faster.

15:58.044 --> 16:02.700
You know, there's a big profit
margin in beer, wine, cocktails,

16:02.744 --> 16:07.618
but you really do need
a liquor license to sell them.

16:07.662 --> 16:10.143
This is a neighborhood place.

16:10.186 --> 16:13.668
I can't be seen as being
all pro

16:13.711 --> 16:16.018
How about just pro

16:20.283 --> 16:21.893
That's all.

16:31.425 --> 16:33.905
So, here I am.

16:36.473 --> 16:38.127
Have a seat.

16:46.788 --> 16:48.311
I read up on you.

16:48.355 --> 16:51.227
Lucius Guerra
Chair Professor

16:51.271 --> 16:55.231
of Intersectional
Justice Studies.

16:55.275 --> 16:57.842
You sure as hell win
for longest title.

16:57.886 --> 16:59.279
What's that mean?

16:59.322 --> 17:01.890
That your background
checks all the boxes.

17:01.933 --> 17:03.370
What boxes?

17:03.413 --> 17:06.503
The ones that labeled you
the real deal,

17:06.547 --> 17:10.768
the next big thing, the fresh
new face of the New York left.

17:10.812 --> 17:13.684
Tell me something,
how's that feel?

17:13.728 --> 17:16.296
What do you want, Commissioner?

17:16.339 --> 17:18.776
Well, before I was
Commissioner Reagan,

17:18.820 --> 17:21.301
I was Detective Reagan,
and I put a high value

17:21.344 --> 17:24.478
on interviewing eyewitnesses
personally.

17:27.350 --> 17:31.963
Did you see Malik Taylor
go under my wheel?

17:32.007 --> 17:35.445
No. I was in front,

17:35.489 --> 17:37.099
happened out
of my line of sight.

17:37.143 --> 17:40.494
Then why are you now saying
I hit him intentionally?

17:40.537 --> 17:42.148
There are plenty of people
that saw what happened.

17:42.191 --> 17:43.932
Plenty of your people,
or just people?

17:43.975 --> 17:45.586
The people next to
and behind Malik.

17:45.629 --> 17:47.805
Which would make them
your people.

17:47.849 --> 17:49.938
I resent that.

17:49.981 --> 17:51.853
And I resent being called
a hit-and-run driver,

17:51.896 --> 17:54.334
but we both know
the rules of this game.

17:54.377 --> 17:57.554
It might be a game to you,
but this is not a game to us.

17:57.598 --> 18:01.123
Oh, yeah, it's a game,

18:01.167 --> 18:04.039
but how about we change it up?

18:04.083 --> 18:07.303
How about I talk
directly to you--

18:07.347 --> 18:09.131
in spite of
the fact that

18:09.175 --> 18:12.047
my staff thinks it's akin
to negotiating with terrorists--

18:12.091 --> 18:15.224
and you talk directly to me

18:15.268 --> 18:19.185
instead of staging stunts
that get innocent people hurt.

18:19.228 --> 18:20.969
It wasn't staged.
It was a hit-and-run.

18:23.537 --> 18:26.192
You know, I don't have
an actual olive branch,

18:26.235 --> 18:29.586
but I hope you realize
what I'm doing here.

18:29.630 --> 18:33.286
When you told your people
to let us pass,

18:33.329 --> 18:36.811
I thought I saw
a hint of civility there.

18:36.854 --> 18:40.293
No, just being practical.

18:40.336 --> 18:42.382
We don't carry guns
or nightsticks, so...

18:42.425 --> 18:46.125
You know, we get
false allegations

18:46.168 --> 18:48.214
thrown at us all the time.

18:48.257 --> 18:51.521
Be sure you're right about this

18:51.565 --> 18:54.220
'cause if there is a crack
in your case against us,

18:54.263 --> 18:57.005
we go at it like junkyard dogs.

18:57.048 --> 18:59.877
That is some olive branch.

18:59.921 --> 19:02.837
Well, actually,
it's better than that.

19:02.880 --> 19:06.536
It's damn good advice given
to you totally free of charge

19:06.580 --> 19:09.191
and with respect
you haven't earned.

19:17.504 --> 19:18.766
Ron.

19:18.809 --> 19:20.898
Jennifer.

19:20.942 --> 19:23.553
Hello, Mr. Reagan.

19:23.597 --> 19:25.381
All right,
you have a good day

19:25.425 --> 19:26.556
at school now, huh.

19:26.600 --> 19:28.123
All right.

19:30.821 --> 19:32.954
Look, I, uh,

19:32.997 --> 19:35.522
think we might've got off
on the wrong foot here.

19:35.565 --> 19:37.045
Feels like the
right foot to me.

19:37.088 --> 19:38.568
Look, my son, he's a good kid,

19:38.612 --> 19:40.222
and he really likes
your daughter,

19:40.266 --> 19:43.051
and Jennifer seems to like him,
so why don't we just allow...

19:43.094 --> 19:44.879
You know, where I come from,
it ain't the kids

19:44.922 --> 19:46.837
who run the family.Uh-huh.

19:46.881 --> 19:49.100
And it's, uh, Texas,
where you're from?

19:49.144 --> 19:51.059
Well, hey, you are
a detective.

19:51.102 --> 19:53.061
Yeah, okay. They teach you
how to be rude

19:53.104 --> 19:54.932
to your new neighbors
where you come from, too?

19:54.976 --> 19:56.978
We sure as hell
don't pull up to a guy

19:57.021 --> 19:58.414
out of nowhere,
start barking orders.

19:58.458 --> 20:01.591
Now some of us have to
get back to work, so, uh,

20:01.635 --> 20:04.246
y'all have a good day.

20:07.641 --> 20:09.860
Y'all.

20:12.602 --> 20:14.648
Call ITB, tell 'em
to get it back online.

20:14.691 --> 20:16.084
I'll try.

20:16.127 --> 20:19.566
Hey. Hey, so
what'd he say?

20:19.609 --> 20:21.394
He who?

20:21.437 --> 20:23.744
Your dad. Did he remember
Art Bancroft?

20:23.787 --> 20:25.920
I didn't talk to him.Oh.

20:25.963 --> 20:27.791
Was I supposed to?

20:27.835 --> 20:30.229
I don't know, just seems
like a real you move--

20:30.272 --> 20:32.535
someone needs help and you help
them, especially if it's a cop.

20:32.579 --> 20:34.537
So now I need
to call for backup?

20:34.581 --> 20:36.278
I'm not saying that.Look, yesterday

20:36.322 --> 20:38.280
it was I was supposed to call
TLC, and now it's my dad.

20:38.324 --> 20:40.108
I'm starting to sense
a pattern here, Officer.

20:40.151 --> 20:41.849
Jamie, you're
a rookie sergeant.

20:41.892 --> 20:44.243
I'm a veteran cop.

20:44.286 --> 20:46.419
And more so a veteran Reagan.

20:46.462 --> 20:48.899
What you guys do, you bounce
everything off each other.

20:48.943 --> 20:50.292
Not everything.

20:50.336 --> 20:51.772
As a sergeant, I have
to pick and choose

20:51.815 --> 20:53.121
what I take to my dad, else
I wear out that welcome.

20:53.164 --> 20:55.993
Okay.

20:56.037 --> 20:57.691
I'm gonna check on Art later,
see how he's doing.

20:57.734 --> 20:59.388
All right?Jamie, I didn't mean...

20:59.432 --> 21:01.085
I've got to get back to work.

21:01.129 --> 21:02.522
Okay. Okay.

21:10.834 --> 21:13.489
Interfering with a
police investigation?

21:13.533 --> 21:15.796
Fleming's a rat, too.

21:15.839 --> 21:17.537
Big surprise.

21:17.580 --> 21:19.103
It is a crime, Anthony,

21:19.147 --> 21:21.280
even for a D.A.'s
investigator.

21:21.323 --> 21:22.585
Yeah, well, as hard
as he was working,

21:22.629 --> 21:24.544
I could have been
interrupting his lunch break.

21:24.587 --> 21:27.634
Fleming also told me that when
patrol showed up at Vivian's,

21:27.677 --> 21:29.418
she and Sophia were
no longer there.

21:29.462 --> 21:31.507
Yeah, because she ran
into Baxter last week

21:31.551 --> 21:33.466
in Dr. Dornan's waiting room.

21:33.509 --> 21:36.033
And out of nowhere,
he started accusing her

21:36.077 --> 21:37.644
of reading his thoughts.

21:37.687 --> 21:39.254
And now he's got her address.

21:39.298 --> 21:41.300
So let Fleming protect her.

21:41.343 --> 21:43.911
Would you, Erin,
if this was your family?

21:43.954 --> 21:47.697
No, no, you would call in
Danny or Jamie.

21:47.741 --> 21:50.352
That's because they're
NYPD, like Fleming.

21:50.396 --> 21:53.312
No, it's because
they're your family.

21:53.355 --> 21:55.879
Which is why protecting mine
is my job.

21:55.923 --> 21:58.360
Baxter doesn't have
my address,

21:58.404 --> 22:00.101
so I took them to my place.

22:00.144 --> 22:01.798
And while you were
playing Papa Bear,

22:01.842 --> 22:04.366
did you happen to mention to
Vivian how you got mixed up

22:04.410 --> 22:05.933
in all this in
the first place?

22:05.976 --> 22:07.630
Now who's sticking their nose
where it doesn't belong?

22:07.674 --> 22:08.979
So, no.

22:09.023 --> 22:10.459
Good God, Erin,

22:10.503 --> 22:12.853
I know I can't lead
this investigation,

22:12.896 --> 22:15.508
but can I please keep track
of my own business?

22:15.551 --> 22:19.338
Great. I don't even want it.

22:31.872 --> 22:33.221
Reagan.

22:33.264 --> 22:35.919
Ron, what the hell
happened to you?

22:35.963 --> 22:38.400
What's it look like?
I got my ass kicked.

22:38.444 --> 22:40.054
You got your ass kicked
by who

22:40.097 --> 22:41.882
My block. A couple--

22:41.925 --> 22:43.710
A couple of doors down, a bunch
of people throwing a party.

22:43.753 --> 22:46.974
Had the music blaring,
so I go over to complain.

22:47.017 --> 22:49.977
On my way home, these...
these three guys followed me.

22:50.020 --> 22:51.413
What the hell did you
come all the way over here for?

22:51.457 --> 22:52.719
Why didn't you just call 911?

22:52.762 --> 22:55.722
Back home, you know a cop,
you go to them.

22:55.765 --> 22:57.680
Well, you don't know me, Ron.

22:57.724 --> 22:59.421
In fact, you don't even
like me. Remember?

22:59.465 --> 23:02.468
Look, Jennifer,
she came to the window

23:02.511 --> 23:04.034
when she saw 'em yell at me.

23:04.078 --> 23:05.427
She heard the whole thing.

23:05.471 --> 23:07.081
Now she's so scared,

23:07.124 --> 23:09.388
she don't even want
to live here no more.

23:09.431 --> 23:11.520
Now, y-you've
got to help me.

23:27.710 --> 23:29.799
Busted.

23:29.843 --> 23:33.194
What? I-I just got
my second wind.

23:33.237 --> 23:34.195
You want in?

23:34.238 --> 23:36.589
No.

23:37.372 --> 23:39.983
But I do have a question.Shoot.

23:40.027 --> 23:41.681
How'd you feel
when Dad stopped

23:41.724 --> 23:43.465
reaching out to
you for help?

23:43.509 --> 23:45.467
When did that ever stop?

23:45.511 --> 23:47.164
No, I mean back in the day,
when he was coming up.

23:47.208 --> 23:48.644
He used to say that
he had you on speed dial

23:48.688 --> 23:49.819
for, like, a decade.

23:49.863 --> 23:52.518
And along came
that fateful day.

23:54.302 --> 23:58.872
June 6, 1982.

23:58.915 --> 24:00.656
You remember the date?

24:00.700 --> 24:02.789
Francis was excited because
he had managed

24:02.832 --> 24:06.662
to defuse a war between
two Chinatown crime bosses.

24:06.706 --> 24:09.491
Everybody else was
excited for him.

24:09.535 --> 24:12.538
I realized...

24:12.581 --> 24:15.715
he'd never so much
as mentioned it to me.

24:15.758 --> 24:17.543
So it stung a little bit.

24:17.586 --> 24:20.894
Maybe more.

24:20.937 --> 24:23.636
But I was proud, too.

24:23.679 --> 24:25.681
Knowing he was able
to strike someone out

24:25.725 --> 24:27.770
because I taught him how
to throw the forkball.

24:29.859 --> 24:31.252
So, what didn't you
go to him for?

24:32.514 --> 24:34.124
Busted.

24:34.168 --> 24:36.344
It's just this thing
with this retired cop,

24:36.387 --> 24:38.520
but I-I handled it.

24:38.564 --> 24:40.043
Handled it, or handled it well?

24:40.087 --> 24:43.133
Both, but Eddie
thought differently.

24:43.177 --> 24:45.701
I keep wondering if
she was right,

24:45.745 --> 24:47.181
and I was just being defensive.

24:47.224 --> 24:51.881
Here's the dirty little secret
about climbing the ladder.

24:51.925 --> 24:56.277
The higher you go, the more
you second-guess yourself.

24:56.320 --> 24:58.105
Yeah?

24:58.148 --> 25:00.411
And with marriage,
it's third and fourth-guessing.

25:03.110 --> 25:05.547
So, I'd say you're
on the right track.

25:05.591 --> 25:08.550
Thanks, Pop.

25:08.594 --> 25:11.335
Now, get out of here...

25:11.379 --> 25:12.685
so I can finish the pie.

25:20.562 --> 25:22.216
Did you hear?

25:22.259 --> 25:24.218
Baxter struck again.

25:24.261 --> 25:26.220
Don't tell me you
went to the scene.
No.

25:26.263 --> 25:29.136
I was too busy sitting up
all night with a gun

25:29.179 --> 25:31.878
in case Baxter came after
Viv and Sophia next.

25:31.921 --> 25:33.619
You said they were
safe at your place.

25:33.662 --> 25:35.142
Well, I thought they were.

25:35.185 --> 25:37.013
And then, after dinner,
we played a little Scrabble.

25:37.057 --> 25:40.190
And then Vivian casually says,
"Oh, by the way,

25:40.234 --> 25:42.932
on my personal info
for Dr. Dornan,"

25:42.976 --> 25:45.674
she used me as her
emergency contact.

25:45.718 --> 25:48.242
Baxter has your address, too.

25:48.285 --> 25:53.029
I need to find
a new place to stash 'em.

25:53.073 --> 25:55.118
So, unless you got
something for me,

25:55.162 --> 25:57.904
I need to make some calls.

26:15.661 --> 26:17.837
Malik.

26:17.880 --> 26:20.100
You got a sec?

26:25.235 --> 26:27.194
Do I know you?Sid Gormley.

26:27.237 --> 26:28.761
And?

26:28.804 --> 26:30.763
Looking good
out there, man.

26:30.806 --> 26:33.374
Are you some kind of scout?

26:33.417 --> 26:37.813
Yeah. NYPD Flop Squad.

26:37.857 --> 26:40.294
What's this about?

26:40.337 --> 26:42.601
It's about that flop
you took the other day

26:42.644 --> 26:44.646
outside the police
commissioner's vehicle.

26:44.690 --> 26:47.475
It wasn't no flop.
I heal fast.

26:47.518 --> 26:49.042
I eat fast.

26:49.085 --> 26:51.784
Doesn't mean I could eat
a steak in 60 seconds, huh?

26:51.827 --> 26:53.089
Who put you up to it?

26:53.133 --> 26:54.613
Nobody put me up to nothing.

26:54.656 --> 26:56.310
Corey Vallejo?

26:56.353 --> 26:58.747
I told you,
nobody put me up to nothing.

26:58.791 --> 27:00.836
The truck, like, took off

27:00.880 --> 27:02.098
and drove right over my foot.

27:02.142 --> 27:04.623
Nah.
Yeah.

27:04.666 --> 27:05.885
They said it might be,
like, messed up.

27:05.928 --> 27:08.017
Who's that

27:08.061 --> 27:11.412
I was in a state of shock.
I don't remember.

27:11.455 --> 27:13.501
I don't believe you.

27:13.544 --> 27:16.896
I need a lawyer.You don't need a lawyer.

27:16.939 --> 27:18.724
You do need some acting lessons

27:18.767 --> 27:22.815
if you're going to continue
down this path, though, Malik.

27:22.858 --> 27:25.774
Okay, kiddo,
time to hit the hay.

27:25.818 --> 27:27.515
Wait, Dad.Huh?

27:27.558 --> 27:29.038
Dad!

27:29.082 --> 27:30.953
Dad-- But I want to see
who wins.

27:30.997 --> 27:32.999
I'll tell you a bedtime
story, you love those.

27:33.042 --> 27:34.435
Nothing too scary, Anthony.

27:34.478 --> 27:36.132
Oh, yes, dear.

27:36.176 --> 27:38.221
Erin, I can't thank you
enough for this.

27:38.265 --> 27:39.919
No need, Anthony's
already thanked me

27:39.962 --> 27:42.008
a dozen times
for the three of you.

27:42.051 --> 27:44.706
I didn't know he actually
knew those words.

27:44.750 --> 27:47.709
I also get the sense that,
despite the circumstances,

27:47.753 --> 27:50.233
he's enjoyed spending time
with you and Sophia this week.

27:50.277 --> 27:53.584
Okay.

27:53.628 --> 27:55.804
Now I need a glass
of what you're drinking.

27:55.848 --> 27:57.893
I know you guys go way back,

27:57.937 --> 28:00.069
further than him and me,

28:00.113 --> 28:01.723
but the guy I know
from the office

28:01.767 --> 28:03.377
is a real sweetheart.

28:03.420 --> 28:05.727
Try picking up after him
for ten years.

28:05.771 --> 28:08.687
Or getting him to put words
to what he's feeling,

28:08.730 --> 28:11.472
or spending half your time
waiting up for him to get home

28:11.515 --> 28:13.387
from being a sweetheart
at the office.

28:13.430 --> 28:16.259
Is that why you're
moving out of state?

28:16.303 --> 28:17.565
What?

28:17.608 --> 28:19.132
You and Sophia.

28:21.177 --> 28:22.657
Did Anthony tell you that?

28:22.701 --> 28:25.051
Well, he-he's worried, Vivian.

28:25.094 --> 28:27.183
Oh, my God, that man.

28:27.227 --> 28:29.359
You see what I mean about
getting him to open up

28:29.403 --> 28:30.578
to me about things?

28:30.621 --> 28:32.188
So it's not true?

28:32.232 --> 28:35.496
No. I'm a Jersey girl,
now and forever.

28:35.539 --> 28:37.237
But you were seeing
Dr. Dornan?

28:37.280 --> 28:38.542
About Sophia.

28:38.586 --> 28:40.414
Is she okay?

28:40.457 --> 28:42.895
She's fine, other than
being a terror lately.

28:42.938 --> 28:44.200
Backtalk, hiding her phone.

28:44.244 --> 28:46.855
She's not even
a teenager yet.

28:46.899 --> 28:49.118
Have you told Anthony this?

28:49.162 --> 28:51.425
I tried, but he won't hear it.

28:51.468 --> 28:54.297
To him, she's his little
angel, always will be.

28:54.341 --> 28:57.605
Then you should thank
your lucky stars.

28:57.648 --> 28:58.737
For what?

28:58.780 --> 29:01.217
Well, if I had a madman
coming after me,

29:01.261 --> 29:03.002
there's no one I'd rather
have between us

29:03.045 --> 29:05.961
than a guy who loves his family
with all his heart.

29:10.313 --> 29:12.620
Uh, John Mayer
or Ed Sheeran?

29:12.663 --> 29:15.275
Ed. Wait. No, John.

29:15.318 --> 29:16.711
Are you sure?
Yeah.

29:16.755 --> 29:19.322
Ooh, Rihanna or Beyoncé?

29:19.366 --> 29:20.628
Ri-Ri.

29:20.671 --> 29:22.195
What?

29:22.238 --> 29:24.588
You're wrong.I can't be wrong,
it's my choice.

29:24.632 --> 29:25.851
No, because both are awesome.Oh...

29:27.156 --> 29:28.331
Hey, hey!

29:28.375 --> 29:29.811
Stop!Everybody get back.

29:29.855 --> 29:32.118
Stay back! Stay back.

29:32.161 --> 29:33.336
Stay low. Stay low.

29:33.380 --> 29:36.209
Police. Don't move!

29:36.252 --> 29:37.253
Art?

29:40.517 --> 29:42.824
Art!

29:42.868 --> 29:44.130
Art, put the gun down.

29:44.173 --> 29:46.654
Come on, put the gun down now.
Come on.

29:46.697 --> 29:49.526
Put the gun down now!

29:49.570 --> 29:50.571
MAYA:
Sir, put the gun down!

29:50.614 --> 29:52.138
Come on, Art, put the gun down!

29:53.879 --> 29:54.923
That's it, go down.

29:54.967 --> 29:57.056
Down. Get on your knees.

29:57.099 --> 29:58.579
Nice and slow.

29:58.622 --> 29:59.623
Put your hands behind your head.

30:04.541 --> 30:05.673
Okay.

30:09.720 --> 30:11.113
Art, what did you do?

30:14.247 --> 30:15.552
What the hell did you do?

30:24.039 --> 30:25.867
JAMIE: Hey, I heard it
over the radio.

30:25.911 --> 30:27.390
What the hell happened?He ain't talking.
We already tried.

30:27.434 --> 30:28.957
He asked for a lawyer.I want to hear if from him.

30:29.001 --> 30:31.612
Hey, hey, hey.
Did you shoot somebody?

30:31.655 --> 30:33.005
Jamie, stop. Hey, Jamie.Did you shoot somebody, Art?

30:33.048 --> 30:35.224
Maya, get him to his cell.After I helped you?!

30:35.268 --> 30:36.878
JANKO: Take him...I got it.
Let's go, let's go.

30:36.922 --> 30:38.314
You can't talk to him!

30:38.358 --> 30:41.796
Jamie, you can't talk to him!

30:41.840 --> 30:43.798
Just... just tell me
what happened.Okay.

30:43.842 --> 30:44.494
What happened?!All right.

30:46.235 --> 30:48.281
I'm gonna tell you after
we process him, okay?

30:48.324 --> 30:50.065
We're gonna do this
the right way.

30:50.109 --> 30:52.111
The way you taught me.

30:52.154 --> 30:53.329
Okay.

31:04.688 --> 31:07.126
Mm. What about when he's eating?

31:07.169 --> 31:08.605
Those nummy noises he makes?

31:08.649 --> 31:10.433
Sometimes I can hear
it from my office.

31:11.217 --> 31:12.871
ABETEMARCO:
It's me.

31:12.914 --> 31:13.959
Can I get it?

31:14.002 --> 31:15.351
Of course.

31:18.964 --> 31:20.922
There's my little girl.

31:22.054 --> 31:24.404
Fleming finally caught Baxter.

31:24.447 --> 31:26.101
VIVIAN:
Oh, thank God.

31:26.145 --> 31:28.625
We can go home.SOPHIA: Do we really
have to go home?

31:28.669 --> 31:30.497
Ms. Reagan's place
is so much better

31:30.540 --> 31:31.846
than living in Hackensack.

31:31.890 --> 31:33.630
ABETEMARCO:
All right, girls.

31:33.674 --> 31:35.589
Let's pack it up
and get out of Erin's hair.

31:35.632 --> 31:37.025
And on the way home,
I'm gonna buy you both

31:37.069 --> 31:38.853
lunch at Aspromonti's.VIVIAN: Oh.

31:38.897 --> 31:40.594
Only if you promise to keep
your elbows off the table.

31:42.248 --> 31:45.338
It's a fancy place.My God, this woman.

31:46.556 --> 31:48.950
Uh, yes, I promise.

31:48.994 --> 31:50.952
And we're gonna have
a little chat about how open

31:50.996 --> 31:52.780
and honest we're gonna be
from now on.

31:52.823 --> 31:54.347
Including you?

31:55.478 --> 31:57.480
Especially me.

32:01.267 --> 32:03.138
Okay, sweetie.
Let's go get our stuff.

32:14.149 --> 32:15.498
Hey.

32:15.542 --> 32:18.588
The driver Art shot
is gonna live.

32:18.632 --> 32:20.982
Apparently, he was
picking up a passenger

32:21.026 --> 32:23.289
and the guy looked over
at him, smiled at Art.

32:23.332 --> 32:25.552
Art took it to mean
like he was mocking him.

32:33.864 --> 32:36.389
He was that on the edge;
I should have seen it.

32:36.432 --> 32:39.218
Jamie, you just were trying
to help him out.

32:39.261 --> 32:40.697
It's different when
the PC checks in on you.

32:40.741 --> 32:41.611
It means something.

32:43.222 --> 32:45.789
No, it just means
that he was way past

32:45.833 --> 32:47.617
needing to just be
checked in on.

32:50.620 --> 32:52.579
You're right.

32:52.622 --> 32:54.537
I am new at this.

32:54.581 --> 32:56.061
You know what you're not?

32:56.104 --> 32:57.932
A fortune teller.

32:57.976 --> 32:59.760
Well, you must be,
because you called it.

32:59.803 --> 33:03.329
No, I didn't.
I just... I made a call.

33:03.372 --> 33:05.070
And maybe this time,

33:05.113 --> 33:07.811
it was right and the next time,
who the hell knows?

33:10.989 --> 33:12.468
Any way you cut it,
this one's on me.

33:15.254 --> 33:16.646
You want some advice?

33:18.300 --> 33:19.519
No.

33:19.562 --> 33:21.477
What do you mean, no?

33:23.566 --> 33:26.439
I'm not ready for advice yet.

33:26.482 --> 33:28.745
I'm still busy
beating myself up about it.

33:37.928 --> 33:39.626
Yeah, that's them.

33:39.669 --> 33:41.062
Good.
How'd you find them?

33:41.106 --> 33:43.195
Your neighbor's
security camera saw.

33:43.238 --> 33:44.631
They had on
their work shirts,

33:44.674 --> 33:46.154
so I was able to
track them down

33:46.198 --> 33:47.982
to the auto body
shop they worked at.

33:48.026 --> 33:50.332
When I got there, couple
of them tried to jump me.

33:50.376 --> 33:52.030
Well, thanks, Reagan.

33:52.073 --> 33:53.248
I-I mean it.

33:53.292 --> 33:55.120
Hey, you moved here,
you got mugged.

33:55.163 --> 33:56.599
It's official: you're
a New Yorker now.

33:56.643 --> 33:58.819
Hey, but next time
you want to, uh,

33:58.862 --> 34:01.082
stand your ground or
whatever the hell it is

34:01.126 --> 34:03.258
you do down there
in Texas, don't.

34:03.302 --> 34:04.520
All right? And
don't call me.

34:04.564 --> 34:05.826
Call 911.

34:05.869 --> 34:07.567
I will.
Good.

34:07.610 --> 34:09.221
Look, um...

34:13.138 --> 34:16.097
Jennifer, she told me
a little more about Sean and...

34:16.141 --> 34:18.230
how respectful he's been,
how he made friends

34:18.273 --> 34:20.536
with her at school
when no one else would.

34:20.580 --> 34:23.104
He's a good young man.

34:23.148 --> 34:25.280
He takes after his mother.

34:25.324 --> 34:26.934
I got a...

34:26.977 --> 34:28.936
couple of tickets
to the Rangers game

34:28.979 --> 34:30.764
at the Garden tomorrow night;
now do you think Sean

34:30.807 --> 34:33.419
could get her into
the city and back...

34:33.462 --> 34:35.029
before curfew?

34:37.292 --> 34:38.815
Yeah, I'm sure he could.

34:45.518 --> 34:46.954
Y'all have a good day now.

34:54.135 --> 34:56.006
And they didn't take
him to a hospital.

34:56.050 --> 34:58.705
They took him to a walk-in
med center on Tenth Avenue.

34:58.748 --> 35:00.402
The doc-in-the-box
is one of

35:00.446 --> 35:01.838
the agitators' uncles,

35:01.882 --> 35:04.363
he ordered up some X-rays
and some scripts

35:04.406 --> 35:06.191
to create a paper trail.

35:06.234 --> 35:09.542
Long story short, the
whole thing was bogus.What do you want to do?

35:09.585 --> 35:11.761
Arrest the whole crew,
charge them with...I meant him.

35:11.805 --> 35:13.763
What do you think
he wants to do?I'm right here,

35:13.807 --> 35:14.721
I can speak for myself.

35:16.505 --> 35:18.594
I'm having Corey Vallejo up.

35:18.638 --> 35:20.205
She claims to have

35:20.248 --> 35:22.163
some information, so...

35:22.207 --> 35:26.080
are we certain she is behind the
scam or at least aware of it?

35:26.124 --> 35:28.517
Walks like a duck,
talks like a duck.

35:28.561 --> 35:30.867
I think we can at least be sure
she didn't drill down

35:30.911 --> 35:32.826
on the facts
and just let it play out

35:32.869 --> 35:34.436
to rile up her base.

35:35.568 --> 35:36.830
She's here.

35:38.614 --> 35:39.572
Let's have her.

35:41.182 --> 35:42.183
I got this one.

35:58.373 --> 35:59.766
Please, sit down.

36:12.518 --> 36:16.086
So... what's the information?

36:16.130 --> 36:19.046
It seems there was
a misunderstanding.

36:19.089 --> 36:21.179
No, it seems like
there was a scam.

36:21.222 --> 36:23.442
Did you order it up
or just go along with it?

36:23.485 --> 36:25.008
Neither.

36:25.052 --> 36:26.967
Some of my people
got overly ambitious

36:27.010 --> 36:28.969
and thought they were doing
our cause a favor.

36:29.012 --> 36:30.405
Get new people.

36:30.449 --> 36:32.320
The cause is like a magnet,
it draws what it draws.

36:32.364 --> 36:34.670
Oh... Give me a break.

36:36.411 --> 36:37.804
I came up here in good faith.

36:40.285 --> 36:42.112
And there it is.

36:42.156 --> 36:43.679
There what is?

36:45.464 --> 36:47.901
The crux of this
particular matter.

36:47.944 --> 36:50.208
See, you say good faith,
I say...

36:50.251 --> 36:52.166
you came up to get ahead of it,

36:52.210 --> 36:54.473
that you've known all along
what I now know.

36:54.516 --> 36:55.952
Am I going too fast for you?

36:55.996 --> 36:57.606
No.

36:57.650 --> 37:01.523
See, what we got here is an
unreliable narrator, that's you.

37:01.567 --> 37:03.308
And a cynical New York cop,
that's me.

37:04.918 --> 37:06.485
I'm a person of integrity
and I came...

37:06.528 --> 37:07.703
Do your homework.

37:09.966 --> 37:11.490
Look up Reverend Darnell Potter.

37:11.533 --> 37:13.143
Look up Shelley Wayne

37:13.187 --> 37:16.277
for the Mothers United
Against Violence.I know who they are.

37:16.321 --> 37:19.585
Then you do know that
I engage with my opposition.

37:19.628 --> 37:21.413
That I can be called out
for faults

37:21.456 --> 37:23.719
in myself and in my department.

37:23.763 --> 37:26.156
That when the accusations
coming out of

37:26.200 --> 37:28.637
your bullhorns have a ring
of truth, I do listen.

37:28.681 --> 37:30.813
No, what's implied
is that you get to choose

37:30.857 --> 37:32.337
what faults
you're accountable for.

37:32.380 --> 37:34.991
Professor, you need to quit
while you're ahead.

37:36.645 --> 37:38.256
And how am I ahead?

37:38.299 --> 37:41.824
I am charging Malik Taylor.

37:41.868 --> 37:44.610
I am giving you a mulligan...

37:44.653 --> 37:46.699
in the hopes
that moving forward,

37:46.742 --> 37:49.702
you will use your smarts
and your talents

37:49.745 --> 37:52.487
to engage on issues honestly

37:52.531 --> 37:56.709
and leave the ambush tactics
to the thugs.

37:56.752 --> 37:59.581
The word is "disruptors."

37:59.625 --> 38:01.714
You can put all the lipstick
you want on it.

38:05.326 --> 38:08.198
This is not your ivory tower.

38:08.242 --> 38:11.332
This is police headquarters.

38:11.376 --> 38:13.334
You attack it...

38:13.378 --> 38:18.165
you best have the facts
and the truth on your side.

38:18.208 --> 38:20.167
And if you pull an act
like this again,

38:20.210 --> 38:21.690
you won't know what hit you.

38:26.478 --> 38:28.784
I hear you.

38:28.828 --> 38:31.396
Even better that you believe me.

38:48.804 --> 38:50.893
NICKY:
I'm just saying,

38:50.937 --> 38:53.287
anybody want to get me
a graduation gift,

38:53.331 --> 38:54.506
that would be
on the short list.

38:54.549 --> 38:55.768
DANNY:
Saving up now.

38:55.811 --> 38:58.118
HENRY: Duly noted.NICKY: Okay.

38:58.161 --> 38:59.554
When is graduation?

38:59.598 --> 39:01.643
Second Saturday in May.
I'm not sure what the date is.

39:01.687 --> 39:02.818
What are you gonna do after?

39:02.862 --> 39:05.647
Partying.

39:05.691 --> 39:07.649
I mean next. Yes.You mean, like get a job?

39:07.693 --> 39:09.085
Or take time off.

39:09.129 --> 39:10.870
No, time off's
what you take from a job.

39:10.913 --> 39:12.872
Time off without a job
is called unemployment.

39:12.915 --> 39:14.308
There's time off
for good behavior,

39:14.352 --> 39:16.876
but that's when
you're in prison.

39:16.919 --> 39:18.094
Is there a prison term
in your future?

39:18.138 --> 39:20.227
Yeah, that's quite a leap.

39:20.270 --> 39:21.837
Yeah, I didn't even say
I wanted to take time off.

39:21.881 --> 39:23.230
Yeah, why would she
take time off?

39:23.273 --> 39:24.710
I just think you should
take advantage

39:24.753 --> 39:26.059
of the natural breaks in life.

39:26.102 --> 39:27.713
Going to school
for 18 years straight.

39:27.756 --> 39:29.367
18 years of anything,
you deserve a break.

39:29.410 --> 39:31.064
DANNY: Yeah, she
deserves a break.

39:31.107 --> 39:32.413
But starting in
high school,

39:32.457 --> 39:35.460
any time off of high school
is get a job time.

39:35.503 --> 39:37.113
Or you can go with a longer
view, take your retirement

39:37.157 --> 39:39.377
in installments
like Travis McGee.

39:40.900 --> 39:41.901
Who's that

39:43.511 --> 39:45.687
The wise hero of
John D. MacDonald's

39:45.731 --> 39:47.036
great book series.

39:47.080 --> 39:48.647
Look, his point was:

39:48.690 --> 39:51.171
you have to take the time
to do the things you want to do

39:51.214 --> 39:53.042
before you're too old
to do them.

39:53.086 --> 39:55.480
Yes, and that takes money.

39:55.523 --> 39:57.482
Or sound planning.
I mean, I always thought

39:57.525 --> 40:00.963
I was smart, but I was never
smart enough to actually do it.

40:01.007 --> 40:03.096
HENRY: Yeah, but your work
was your adventure

40:03.139 --> 40:04.750
and your hobby;
nothing wrong with that.

40:04.793 --> 40:07.535
And, oh, Nicky. Please.

40:07.579 --> 40:09.581
Promise me one thing.

40:09.624 --> 40:11.713
After you graduate,
take the knowledge with you,

40:11.757 --> 40:14.455
leave the tactics behind.

40:14.499 --> 40:15.935
Yeah.The tactics?

40:15.978 --> 40:17.806
The Hudson University professor?

40:17.850 --> 40:19.721
For one, yeah.

40:19.765 --> 40:21.114
What's that ambush
have to do with college?

40:21.157 --> 40:23.769
All I'm saying
is if there was ever a time

40:23.812 --> 40:26.946
for that kind of disruption,
to use the current euphemism,

40:26.989 --> 40:28.730
it's college--
the premise and promise

40:28.774 --> 40:32.255
of campus life is an invitation
to push the boundaries.

40:32.299 --> 40:33.518
That's a little simplistic.

40:33.561 --> 40:35.171
Yes, it is.

40:35.215 --> 40:37.260
But bear with me,
I'm on a very narrow path here.

40:37.304 --> 40:40.307
When you take
that kind of atmosphere

40:40.350 --> 40:43.179
and inject it into real-world,
workaday life,

40:43.223 --> 40:46.313
as she did with us,
in that diner,

40:46.356 --> 40:49.098
the so-called disruption
drowns out

40:49.142 --> 40:52.624
any valid point you have.

40:52.667 --> 40:54.887
On either side.

40:54.930 --> 40:56.497
Class dismissed.

40:56.541 --> 40:58.194
Pass the meat.
