00:59.709 --> 01:03.376
"It is not possible for me to know
if the infinite jungle has started on me

01:03.459 --> 01:07.251
the process that has taken many others
to complete and irremediable insanity.

01:07.334 --> 01:10.584
In this case, I can only apologize
and ask for your understanding,

01:10.667 --> 01:13.626
for the display I witnessed
in those enchanted hours was such

01:13.709 --> 01:17.209
that I find it impossible to describe
in words its beauty and splendor;

01:17.292 --> 01:20.459
all I know is that, when I came back,
I had become another man."

01:20.542 --> 01:21.942
Theodor von Martius, Amazonia, 1909

02:48.917 --> 02:50.334
Yukuna?

02:51.709 --> 02:53.084
Tukano?

02:54.459 --> 02:55.501
Wanano?

02:55.959 --> 02:58.126
- Kobeu?
- Go away.

03:00.501 --> 03:01.709
Go away!

03:09.584 --> 03:12.459
Are you Karamakate, the world mover?

03:22.917 --> 03:24.251
What do you want?

03:24.334 --> 03:29.209
I am Manduca, son of Rúibukuri,
of the Maloka Komeilemong.

03:29.292 --> 03:31.959
- I am Bará of the river...
- I know the Barás.

03:32.042 --> 03:34.501
You submitted to the whites
without a fight.

03:34.584 --> 03:36.001
What do you want?

03:37.042 --> 03:40.126
This is Theodor von Martius,
my friend and travel partner.

03:40.209 --> 03:41.792
He is very sick.

03:46.126 --> 03:50.792
All of the nearby shamans
tried to heal him. No one could.

03:51.334 --> 03:53.792
They all said you were the only one
who could help us.

03:58.834 --> 04:00.334
I'm not like you.

04:01.542 --> 04:03.542
I don't help the whites.

04:04.584 --> 04:06.834
He is a wise man,
who has come to learn.

04:06.917 --> 04:08.542
He'll die if you don't help him!

04:12.042 --> 04:13.167
Where did you get this?

04:13.251 --> 04:14.667
Let go of him!

04:15.334 --> 04:18.041
- Where did you get this?
- What?

04:18.709 --> 04:19.709
The necklace!

04:21.166 --> 04:24.167
It was a gift from a Cohiuano shaman.

04:25.917 --> 04:28.376
Liar! The Cohiuano don't exist!

04:29.042 --> 04:30.501
They do exist,

04:31.126 --> 04:34.376
I was with them a few years ago.

04:34.459 --> 04:35.542
Liar!

04:36.167 --> 04:37.876
<i>Ayúmpari.</i>

04:39.209 --> 04:40.542
I'm not lying.

04:41.251 --> 04:44.209
Some of them remain,
by the edge of the Yari river.

04:45.292 --> 04:47.917
They are few, but they are still there.

04:53.376 --> 04:54.792
The Cohiuano don't exist anymore.

04:55.334 --> 04:57.417
You killed them all.

04:58.584 --> 05:00.042
I won't help you.

06:53.459 --> 06:56.751
It's okay, Manduca. It's okay.

06:59.667 --> 07:01.667
Let's go.

07:02.459 --> 07:04.209
Only yakruna can save you.

07:05.084 --> 07:08.334
If the Cohiuano still exist,
then they'll have it.

07:08.959 --> 07:10.209
If not, you will die.

07:11.251 --> 07:14.792
This plant can cure me?

07:14.876 --> 07:16.501
Do my people still exist?

07:20.834 --> 07:24.334
The jungle is fragile,
and if you attack her, she strikes back.

07:24.417 --> 07:26.792
The only way she will allow us to travel
is if we respect her.

07:26.876 --> 07:29.709
We must not eat meat or fish

07:30.376 --> 07:32.376
until the rains begin

07:32.751 --> 07:35.209
and we ask for permission
to the Owners of Animals.

07:35.292 --> 07:37.584
We can't cut any tree from its root.

07:38.251 --> 07:41.667
If a woman is found, no intercourse
until the change of moon.

07:42.584 --> 07:44.251
Do you accept?

07:44.334 --> 07:45.626
Theo,

07:45.709 --> 07:47.209
you're in no condition to travel.

07:48.084 --> 07:50.334
I can't die here.

07:54.334 --> 07:55.626
Do you accept?

07:58.084 --> 08:01.459
You better be telling the truth.
This medicine only heals momentarily.

08:02.126 --> 08:05.626
When it returns,
it will come back stronger.

08:06.667 --> 08:08.459
It's the truth.

08:08.542 --> 08:10.042
I've been with them.

09:41.126 --> 09:45.042
EMBRACE OF THE SERPENT

11:31.251 --> 11:32.626
Tukano?

11:35.917 --> 11:37.001
Andoke?

11:40.001 --> 11:41.417
Karihona?

11:43.626 --> 11:44.667
Muinane?

11:44.751 --> 11:46.876
You can see me?

11:52.626 --> 11:54.751
Many years ago, this man,

11:55.751 --> 11:57.417
Theodor von Martius,

11:59.792 --> 12:03.501
was here and he wrote
about the plant I'm looking for.

12:03.584 --> 12:08.334
I want to know if his writings are true.

12:08.417 --> 12:10.209
I devote my life to plants.

12:10.292 --> 12:11.959
You devote your life to plants?

12:14.626 --> 12:17.876
That's the most reasonable thing
I've ever heard a white say.

12:21.709 --> 12:23.001
My name is Evan.

12:23.084 --> 12:25.834
My name was Karamakate.

12:25.917 --> 12:30.126
I come downriver from the Maloka
of the Wanano people.

12:30.209 --> 12:32.626
I'm looking for a plant.

12:32.709 --> 12:34.084
Yakruna.

12:34.584 --> 12:35.876
Which plant is that?

12:36.292 --> 12:39.667
I know very little of it.
I don't even know if it exists.

12:39.751 --> 12:41.501
I want to learn about it.

12:41.917 --> 12:46.167
Von Martius described it as
a sacred plant that can heal diseases.

12:46.251 --> 12:50.626
That grows on the rubber
and raises its level of purity.

12:50.709 --> 12:53.126
Is that why you want it?

13:10.167 --> 13:11.751
Is that mambe?

13:12.459 --> 13:14.209
Do you like our coca?

13:14.584 --> 13:18.292
Do you want to take yakruna too?

13:18.959 --> 13:22.167
I can give you a lot of money
if you help me.

13:30.876 --> 13:32.209
It's a lot of money.

13:38.376 --> 13:40.876
Ants like money.

13:41.876 --> 13:44.542
I don't. It tastes bad.

13:50.251 --> 13:52.167
I've never dreamt.

13:54.501 --> 13:57.001
Neither awake nor sleeping.

13:57.584 --> 13:59.126
Not even

14:00.126 --> 14:02.584
caapi has had any effect on me.

14:03.292 --> 14:05.751
The shamans from the Barás,

14:05.834 --> 14:08.042
Tukano and Siriano villages

14:08.126 --> 14:11.167
said only yakruna

14:12.417 --> 14:13.542
could help me.

14:16.959 --> 14:21.542
I had a dream once of a white spirit.

14:21.626 --> 14:23.334
He was sick,

14:24.167 --> 14:27.917
and the only way he could heal
was by learning to dream.

14:28.001 --> 14:29.667
But he couldn't.

14:31.542 --> 14:34.126
Are your dreams
worth a lot of money to you?

14:35.751 --> 14:37.709
Do you know where to find yakruna?

14:38.876 --> 14:40.209
Do you have more mambe?

14:41.459 --> 14:43.292
I have some coca.

15:37.001 --> 15:38.001
Is something wrong?

15:38.959 --> 15:43.876
I forgot mambe existed.

15:44.417 --> 15:49.376
Now I don't know how to make it.

16:38.876 --> 16:42.501
Will you help me find yakruna?

16:45.709 --> 16:47.626
You are not one.

16:47.709 --> 16:49.209
You are two men.

16:53.376 --> 16:56.751
I want to see yakruna.
I'll go with you.

16:56.834 --> 16:58.501
Do you know the way?

16:59.876 --> 17:01.542
I don't remember.

17:03.251 --> 17:05.334
You will take me.

17:22.291 --> 17:24.041
Did you make all these?

17:26.376 --> 17:28.251
What do they mean?

17:34.042 --> 17:36.459
I don't know.

17:36.542 --> 17:38.251
I can't remember.

17:39.001 --> 17:41.376
These rocks used to talk to me.

17:41.459 --> 17:44.209
They answered my questions.

17:44.709 --> 17:49.042
The line is broken,
my memories are gone.

17:50.084 --> 17:52.751
Rocks, trees, animals,

17:52.834 --> 17:55.417
they all went silent.

17:56.042 --> 17:58.709
Now they're just pictures on rocks.

17:59.709 --> 18:02.001
Now I'm empty,

18:02.084 --> 18:04.667
I'm a chullachaqui.

18:16.251 --> 18:20.209
This is similar
to a drawing I saw of yakruna.

18:35.042 --> 18:36.709
These are mountains.

18:37.876 --> 18:39.542
A group of mountains.

18:40.542 --> 18:42.667
It is the "Workshop of the Gods".

18:44.042 --> 18:45.167
That's where

18:45.959 --> 18:47.459
yakruna grows.

19:22.376 --> 19:25.584
How could I forget the gifts
that the Gods gave to us?

19:25.667 --> 19:29.251
I've even forgotten
how to make the mambe.

19:30.959 --> 19:35.834
What have I become?

20:38.709 --> 20:40.542
We're too heavy.

20:40.626 --> 20:42.292
We need to drop these boxes.

20:44.334 --> 20:48.292
No, they're mine. I need them.

20:49.834 --> 20:51.834
They'll drag us down.

20:53.001 --> 20:56.542
- Throw them away.
- They're useful.

20:58.376 --> 20:59.876
You can look at them if you want.

21:13.501 --> 21:16.001
That's not him.
That's his chullachaqui.

21:17.542 --> 21:18.542
What?

21:19.834 --> 21:23.292
His chullachaqui.
It looks just like him.

21:25.751 --> 21:27.376
It's a picture.

21:28.917 --> 21:33.042
It happened to us both.
We turned into chullachaquis.

21:36.167 --> 21:38.417
Did you meet him?

21:44.126 --> 21:46.167
Do you know what he's like?

21:48.334 --> 21:50.001
Is he an old man like me?

21:51.209 --> 21:52.501
No,

21:53.709 --> 21:59.417
he died in this jungle.

22:00.167 --> 22:03.459
He never came back from his trip.

22:05.001 --> 22:06.792
How did he give you this?

22:07.501 --> 22:11.626
Manduca, his travel partner,
sent his diaries

22:12.417 --> 22:14.251
to Germany.

22:14.334 --> 22:18.084
They were published there.

24:15.501 --> 24:18.876
Manduca, do we have something
to exchange for provisions?

24:18.959 --> 24:20.334
Not a lot.

24:45.084 --> 24:46.376
Are you okay?

24:46.876 --> 24:48.126
Are you better?

24:54.417 --> 24:55.709
The world mover?

24:58.001 --> 25:00.126
This is Karamakate.

25:00.209 --> 25:02.584
He agreed to help me.

25:29.251 --> 25:31.501
I have to keep the prohibitions.

25:32.876 --> 25:35.709
You need strength for the travel.
You can eat it.

25:38.751 --> 25:40.417
Can I?

26:00.209 --> 26:03.709
How do we reach the Yari
from here, then?

26:04.459 --> 26:07.834
You must follow the Uraricoera star
all the way to the Igara River.

26:07.917 --> 26:10.251
Which star is that?

26:10.792 --> 26:13.584
The one that is visible
during the sunset, that way.

26:14.126 --> 26:15.542
That way?

26:22.042 --> 26:23.876
What is that?

26:24.542 --> 26:26.209
It's a compass.

26:30.167 --> 26:32.292
It always points

26:32.376 --> 26:35.001
to the Auakaruna star.

26:35.792 --> 26:39.209
The needle is attracted
by the Earth's magnetic field.

26:39.292 --> 26:40.459
Why?

26:42.084 --> 26:45.209
It will always point to the direction
that the Earth's energy indicates.

26:45.292 --> 26:47.876
Theo, sing your song!

26:47.959 --> 26:50.792
No! Not again!

26:56.709 --> 26:59.376
Manduca, I will not sing alone.

26:59.876 --> 27:00.876
Sing with me!

27:01.209 --> 27:02.876
Come.

28:16.876 --> 28:17.876
Who are you?

28:21.792 --> 28:24.376
How can you live alone
in the jungle like this?

28:54.667 --> 28:55.834
Manduca,

28:56.709 --> 28:58.626
do you have the compass?

28:59.126 --> 29:01.251
Did you leave it in the maloka?

29:05.126 --> 29:07.792
Did any of you take my compass?

29:10.292 --> 29:12.376
Did any of you take my compass?

29:21.667 --> 29:23.084
Give it back.

29:32.251 --> 29:33.751
Give it back, you thieves!

29:34.334 --> 29:35.834
Which one of you has it?

29:39.042 --> 29:40.542
Leave him, Theo.

29:41.292 --> 29:43.792
I can't leave a compass here, Manduca.

29:44.751 --> 29:49.292
Tuschaua, tell them to give it back.

29:56.417 --> 30:00.209
Please, Tuschaua, I need it.

30:00.751 --> 30:03.209
I'm not going to exchange it.

30:03.876 --> 30:05.501
Please give it back.

30:08.334 --> 30:13.042
Please, Tuschaua, I need it.

30:20.792 --> 30:21.792
Let's go.

30:21.876 --> 30:25.667
I told you,
I can't leave a compass here.

30:42.376 --> 30:43.376
What?

30:44.709 --> 30:45.876
You're nothing but a white.

30:46.501 --> 30:50.959
Their orientation system is based on
the winds and the position of the stars.

30:51.042 --> 30:54.292
If they learn how to use a compass,
that knowledge will be lost.

30:54.834 --> 30:57.167
You cannot forbid them to learn.

30:57.876 --> 31:00.167
Knowledge belongs to all men.

31:01.001 --> 31:03.667
But you can't understand that,
because you're nothing but a white.

32:25.834 --> 32:27.501
Are you all right?

33:16.084 --> 33:18.459
Leave all that.

33:19.751 --> 33:21.501
They're just things.

33:22.334 --> 33:23.334
No.

33:24.042 --> 33:26.126
Why do you whites
love your things so much?

33:28.876 --> 33:31.292
They're not just things.

33:31.376 --> 33:35.292
They are my only bond
to my people in Germany,

33:35.376 --> 33:37.626
to my town, my wife, my children.

33:38.459 --> 33:41.709
These boxes contain
all the knowledge I've gathered

33:41.792 --> 33:43.542
in four years of travel.

33:43.626 --> 33:48.376
I have to keep them,
otherwise nobody will believe me.

33:54.501 --> 33:59.667
Leaving them is leaving everything.

34:03.501 --> 34:04.709
You're insane.

34:07.001 --> 34:08.042
I know.

34:49.833 --> 34:52.333
The rubber barons gave you those scars?

34:53.333 --> 34:55.876
Yes, but I'm a free man now.

34:59.542 --> 35:04.959
Is this the spot where the anaconda
descended from the Milky Way,

35:05.042 --> 35:07.167
carrying our Karipulakena ancestors?

36:29.001 --> 36:31.709
Damn rubber!

37:35.542 --> 37:37.292
Do you understand what he's saying?

37:42.376 --> 37:44.084
He's asking you to kill him.

38:04.834 --> 38:06.959
You brought a gun?

38:07.042 --> 38:08.376
You can't kill him!

38:08.459 --> 38:09.501
Manduca, stop it!

38:09.584 --> 38:10.876
What are you doing?

38:11.417 --> 38:13.626
If I don't do it,
they'll torture him to death.

38:13.709 --> 38:16.167
Don't do this.

38:16.251 --> 38:17.292
Don't do this!

38:18.376 --> 38:19.834
Nobody deserves this hell.

38:19.917 --> 38:21.542
Manduca, stop.

39:03.584 --> 39:05.126
Karamakate.

39:14.542 --> 39:15.834
Let's go.

39:17.584 --> 39:19.251
I'm not going.

39:20.376 --> 39:21.876
What's wrong?

39:27.292 --> 39:28.959
Whites can't be trusted.

39:29.876 --> 39:32.251
I have no reason to trust you either.

39:32.751 --> 39:34.459
So, what do we do?

39:35.292 --> 39:37.292
Is this your knowledge? Shotguns?

39:37.959 --> 39:41.542
All your science only leads to this,
violence,

39:42.084 --> 39:43.459
death.

39:43.542 --> 39:45.001
You're wrong.

39:45.501 --> 39:48.334
What else are you stealing? Coca?

39:49.251 --> 39:52.459
Quina? Rubber?

39:52.542 --> 39:56.334
That's why you want to steal yakruna?
What else are you going to turn into death?

39:56.417 --> 40:00.042
Don't talk to him like that.
He's done more for our people than you.

40:00.126 --> 40:03.126
And you? Look at your clothes.
The same as the white men.

40:03.209 --> 40:05.709
How could you let them
culture you like this?

40:06.751 --> 40:08.459
You think like the white men,
you think nothing.

40:08.542 --> 40:11.459
What side are you on? You're a caboclo.

40:13.917 --> 40:16.751
I've never met anyone
more loyal than Manduca.

40:17.251 --> 40:19.501
He has never stopped
defending his people. And you?

40:20.126 --> 40:23.251
What have you done?
Run away from the world,

40:23.334 --> 40:25.001
isolate yourself, like a madman.

40:26.334 --> 40:28.459
I'm not stealing anything.

40:34.209 --> 40:35.334
Look!

40:43.876 --> 40:45.334
This is my knowledge.

40:45.417 --> 40:47.792
You try to understand
the world around you too.

40:48.251 --> 40:50.584
You tell stories as well.

40:51.334 --> 40:54.584
I send them to my wife,
my people in Germany.

40:55.959 --> 40:58.876
This is not death, this is life.

40:58.959 --> 41:00.001
This is my song.

41:01.667 --> 41:02.667
What is this?

41:04.001 --> 41:06.001
It's a drawing I made.

41:06.459 --> 41:08.126
Where did you see it?

41:10.542 --> 41:11.542
In a dream.

41:14.376 --> 41:16.501
A dream of caapi?

41:19.334 --> 41:21.834
No. I've never been allowed
to drink caapi.

41:21.917 --> 41:24.626
This is the only dream I've ever had.

41:33.584 --> 41:35.542
I ain't no caboclo.

42:19.376 --> 42:22.376
If those rubber barons are men,
I am a snake.

42:26.042 --> 42:27.376
Is that a fire?

42:27.459 --> 42:29.459
No. It's the Peruvians.

42:30.001 --> 42:31.334
Come.

42:46.626 --> 42:48.459
We must talk to Master Caapi.

42:49.792 --> 42:53.209
- He's the only one who can explain.
- What are you talking about?

42:55.251 --> 42:57.001
The drawing you made. I dreamt it.

42:58.417 --> 43:00.917
But that is not possible.

43:02.751 --> 43:05.417
Of course it's possible.

43:06.584 --> 43:08.459
Do you feel ready to drink?

43:10.126 --> 43:11.792
Am I allowed?

43:54.042 --> 43:55.751
Drink without fear.

44:25.667 --> 44:27.501
It's already cleaned you inside.

44:28.084 --> 44:29.209
You can drink again.

44:30.626 --> 44:31.709
Drink.

45:14.209 --> 45:15.542
You have to let go.

45:34.376 --> 45:35.709
Watoíma.

45:38.042 --> 45:39.834
I don't want to die.

45:44.876 --> 45:46.792
I don't want to die.

45:56.667 --> 45:59.126
Why wouldn't Master Caapi
speak to me?

46:00.834 --> 46:04.209
I don't understand.
It's never happened before.

46:05.792 --> 46:07.167
What did you see?

46:12.042 --> 46:13.709
The Master took me to see the jaguar.

46:16.542 --> 46:20.126
He told me that Watoíma transformed
into a boa when it hit the ground.

46:20.209 --> 46:21.959
It has a mandate.

46:23.667 --> 46:24.667
What mandate?

46:27.042 --> 46:28.042
To kill you.

46:35.126 --> 46:36.876
Is this boa my disease?

46:41.626 --> 46:43.251
No. It's something else.

46:43.334 --> 46:45.626
If Master Caapi wouldn't talk to me,

46:45.709 --> 46:48.209
will yakruna still help me?

46:49.042 --> 46:52.334
He spoke to you, but you couldn't listen.
I'll have to show you.

46:56.209 --> 46:57.876
Did the jaguar say something about me?

47:02.084 --> 47:03.501
He asked me to protect you.

47:12.584 --> 47:16.876
<i>Last night, I finally found
the opportunity to clear that vision</i>

47:16.959 --> 47:19.292
<i>I had back in Germany,</i>

47:19.376 --> 47:21.542
<i>lying next to you,</i>

47:21.626 --> 47:23.417
<i>all those years ago.</i>

47:24.126 --> 47:26.876
<i>I finally had a chance to understand</i>

47:26.959 --> 47:29.834
<i>why I imagined a jaguar.</i>

47:31.001 --> 47:32.501
<i>But no matter</i>

47:32.584 --> 47:34.667
how hard I tried,

47:35.167 --> 47:37.084
how much I wanted to,

47:37.709 --> 47:42.667
I remained completely immune
to the effect of caapi.

47:44.334 --> 47:47.292
I feel that I have failed, my love.

47:48.542 --> 47:52.834
I will be forced to accept
that my colleagues were right

47:53.501 --> 47:56.542
when they criticized my journey.

47:56.626 --> 47:59.917
I fear that I drifted away from you

48:00.001 --> 48:03.876
only to die thousands of miles
from our home.

48:03.959 --> 48:06.126
I can only hope that this disease

48:06.209 --> 48:09.459
is caused by the deep nostalgia

48:09.542 --> 48:11.459
of not having you beside me,

48:11.542 --> 48:16.792
and I beg you to forgive me
for expressing these dark feelings.

48:18.542 --> 48:22.167
But I also hope, my love,

48:28.417 --> 48:31.042
that you will find in my honesty,

48:31.126 --> 48:35.084
another proof of my affection...

48:36.459 --> 48:40.209
What is it? Can you understand me?

48:41.167 --> 48:43.459
No, but you look like
you're about to cry.

48:43.542 --> 48:45.376
He's writing to his woman.

48:50.167 --> 48:51.834
I enjoy expressing my affection to her.

48:52.334 --> 48:56.334
To a woman?
Before or after you cry?

48:57.876 --> 48:59.209
You cannot understand.

49:00.084 --> 49:03.792
And when you go back, are you going
to express your affection to me too?

50:06.292 --> 50:07.792
What are you doing?

50:09.042 --> 50:10.667
I have to keep it.

50:12.542 --> 50:14.209
But it's me.

50:15.126 --> 50:17.167
It's not you. It's an image of you.

50:19.709 --> 50:21.209
Like a chullachaqui?

50:22.792 --> 50:24.834
A what?

50:24.917 --> 50:26.917
A chullachaqui.

50:28.584 --> 50:30.126
We all have one.

50:30.209 --> 50:36.501
He looks just like you,
but he's empty, hollow.

50:37.751 --> 50:40.792
This is a memory.
A moment that passed.

50:42.209 --> 50:46.084
A chullachaqui has no memories.

50:46.167 --> 50:49.167
It only drifts around in the world,

50:49.251 --> 50:51.792
empty, like a ghost,
lost in time without time.

50:58.417 --> 51:01.834
Are you going to show my chullachaqui
to your people?

51:02.334 --> 51:03.834
If you allow me.

51:35.376 --> 51:38.209
The necklace is part of a Cohiuano.
It cannot be exchanged.

52:39.292 --> 52:41.376
You have to stick the paddle
closer to the boat.

52:44.376 --> 52:46.584
Listen, the river can tell you when to row.

52:49.376 --> 52:50.376
Like this?

53:05.917 --> 53:08.167
Why didn't you go back
to your people before?

53:16.792 --> 53:18.876
The Colombians razed everything.
Nothing was left.

53:21.667 --> 53:23.459
Didn't you ever wish to go back and see?

53:25.626 --> 53:26.792
I was only a child.

53:28.751 --> 53:30.876
How did you survive?

54:04.167 --> 54:06.167
Another rubber plantation?

54:07.001 --> 54:08.501
Not anymore.

54:10.751 --> 54:12.751
It says here it's a Mission.

54:15.292 --> 54:16.959
We should stop and get some supplies.

54:19.209 --> 54:20.792
No. Let's keep going.

54:22.334 --> 54:24.042
I know this place.

54:24.834 --> 54:27.084
How are our supplies?

54:28.334 --> 54:29.542
Not so good.

54:32.834 --> 54:34.542
We're stopping.

55:04.626 --> 55:06.501
Hello, little brother.

55:06.584 --> 55:07.959
What's your name?

55:08.626 --> 55:10.626
Manhekanalienípe.

55:11.667 --> 55:14.959
That's not your name! We're not allowed
to speak in pagan language.

55:15.792 --> 55:16.959
My name is Jeremías.

55:19.709 --> 55:20.709
Where is the priest?

55:24.792 --> 55:26.376
Where is the priest?

56:12.792 --> 56:14.876
Go away!

56:22.709 --> 56:24.667
We don't have any rubber!

56:26.667 --> 56:27.834
We don't want rubber.

56:28.917 --> 56:30.084
What do you want?

56:30.167 --> 56:32.917
My name is Theodor von Martius,

56:33.667 --> 56:36.042
I am an ethnographer
of the University of Tübingen

56:36.626 --> 56:38.876
and the Museum of Stuttgart, Germany.

56:39.709 --> 56:44.459
These are my travel mates,
Manduca and Karamakate.

56:44.542 --> 56:46.001
What do you want?

56:47.376 --> 56:50.459
We are conducting an expedition

56:50.542 --> 56:53.376
and we are looking
for supplies to trade.

56:54.292 --> 56:56.376
Fruits, mandioca, whatever.

56:56.459 --> 56:58.376
Not interested. Go away.

56:58.459 --> 57:01.292
I have money. I can pay.

57:01.376 --> 57:02.917
Go away!

57:04.626 --> 57:05.626
Let's go.

57:06.834 --> 57:08.667
What did he say?

57:09.959 --> 57:13.042
Pagan languages
are not permitted here.

57:13.917 --> 57:16.542
"If thou shall judge me fair to the Lord,

57:16.626 --> 57:19.209
come to my house and stay in it."

57:19.876 --> 57:20.876
Easy.

57:20.917 --> 57:23.584
We can't keep going our way
without food.

57:24.959 --> 57:26.501
You're a capuchin, right?

57:28.792 --> 57:31.001
Please, help us.

57:31.584 --> 57:33.792
We will stick to your rules.

57:33.876 --> 57:36.751
We will speak nothing but Spanish.

57:37.292 --> 57:39.334
We are men of science.

57:39.417 --> 57:42.001
Like St. Thomas Aquinas.

57:44.001 --> 57:45.459
"Do not forget to show hospitality,

57:45.542 --> 57:49.126
for because of it...

57:49.209 --> 57:51.459
...Many unknowingly

57:52.126 --> 57:54.376
hosted my angels."

57:59.417 --> 58:01.459
I doubt you're angels.

58:01.542 --> 58:05.376
But it is not for me to refuse
hospitality in the house of God.

58:06.709 --> 58:10.876
Be welcome to the Mission
of San Antonio de Padua in Vaupés.

58:48.917 --> 58:52.209
It's forbidden to eat fish
before the rains come.

59:00.042 --> 59:02.667
How long have you been here?

59:02.751 --> 59:05.751
I came after the massacre
of the Peruvians.

59:07.001 --> 59:09.292
It will be ten years soon.

59:10.001 --> 59:12.167
Have you been alone all this time?

59:12.959 --> 59:14.042
No.

59:14.792 --> 59:19.626
Brother Marcelino and the elders

59:19.709 --> 59:23.417
went looking for new disciples
two years ago

59:23.501 --> 59:25.001
and they haven't returned.

59:25.876 --> 59:28.501
Didn't you see them downriver?

59:33.959 --> 59:36.084
Do you only steal boys?

59:36.709 --> 59:38.709
Our mission is sacred.

59:39.251 --> 59:45.167
We must save the souls
of the orphans of the rubber war,

59:45.251 --> 59:49.834
and keep them away
from cannibalism and ignorance.

01:00:01.042 --> 01:00:03.501
IN RECOGNITION OF THE COURAGE OF
THE COLOMBIAN RUBBER PIONEERS

01:00:03.584 --> 01:00:07.001
WHO BROUGHT CIVILIZATION
TO THE LAND OF CANNIBAL SAVAGES

01:00:07.084 --> 01:00:09.626
AND SHOWED THEM THE PATH OF GOD
AND HIS HOLY CHURCH.

01:00:09.709 --> 01:00:12.292
RAFAEL REYES
PRESIDENT OF COLOMBIA, AUGUST 1907

01:00:25.376 --> 01:00:26.626
Hand me a pot.

01:00:33.584 --> 01:00:36.334
I know what it's like in here.

01:00:36.417 --> 01:00:39.209
Whites are crazy.

01:00:48.917 --> 01:00:50.126
Come.

01:00:52.709 --> 01:00:53.709
Come. Don't be afraid.

01:01:01.584 --> 01:01:05.251
Look. This is chiricaspi.

01:01:06.459 --> 01:01:08.834
A gift that our Karipulakena ancestors
received from the gods.

01:01:08.917 --> 01:01:11.459
We received the sun's semen when Yeba,

01:01:11.542 --> 01:01:14.459
the sun's daughter, scratched his penis

01:01:14.542 --> 01:01:17.209
and ground the semen to dust.

01:01:17.292 --> 01:01:21.167
We must do the same
with this plant before boiling it.

01:01:22.417 --> 01:01:24.042
Help me.

01:01:30.792 --> 01:01:34.042
This is the strongest defense
we have against any disease.

01:01:34.792 --> 01:01:36.959
It will help you endure.

01:01:37.792 --> 01:01:40.542
Priests picked me up too,
when the rubber barons killed my people.

01:01:40.626 --> 01:01:43.001
They didn't surrender to them,

01:01:46.084 --> 01:01:50.292
they fought.

01:01:50.376 --> 01:01:52.042
That's what you have to do.

01:01:52.584 --> 01:01:56.626
Don't believe their crazy tales
about eating the body of their gods.

01:01:57.459 --> 01:01:59.667
They give you food,

01:02:00.209 --> 01:02:03.001
but they don't respect the prohibitions.

01:02:03.084 --> 01:02:06.459
One day they will finish
all the food in the jungle.

01:02:09.626 --> 01:02:12.292
You are still small,
so the jungle will forgive you.

01:02:12.376 --> 01:02:14.417
Master Caapi will guide you.

01:02:14.501 --> 01:02:18.792
Every plant, every tree,
every flower is full of wisdom.

01:02:20.501 --> 01:02:24.209
Never forget who you are
or where you came from.

01:02:24.751 --> 01:02:27.042
Don't let our song fade away.

01:03:48.209 --> 01:03:49.709
Don't touch me!

01:03:50.209 --> 01:03:53.542
You brought the devil to the community!

01:03:54.126 --> 01:03:56.709
You pervert the innocents!

01:04:16.917 --> 01:04:18.251
We have to go.

01:04:19.626 --> 01:04:22.292
- We must take them.
- We can't.

01:04:25.459 --> 01:04:26.917
The others will kill them.

01:04:28.667 --> 01:04:31.959
We can't feed them.

01:04:40.959 --> 01:04:42.042
Run.

01:04:42.959 --> 01:04:44.626
Run.

01:06:45.167 --> 01:06:46.792
Which way?

01:06:48.251 --> 01:06:50.417
I don't know. You're the guide.

01:07:28.126 --> 01:07:30.001
You could help me.

01:07:31.792 --> 01:07:33.709
You won't find anything in there.

01:08:14.584 --> 01:08:16.584
Are you interested in rubber?

01:08:18.959 --> 01:08:22.126
I've never seen a strain like this.

01:08:23.042 --> 01:08:24.292
Rubber means death.

01:08:24.376 --> 01:08:26.959
But it's what you're looking for, right?

01:08:27.042 --> 01:08:28.959
You are two men.

01:08:29.042 --> 01:08:30.167
What are you talking about?

01:08:30.251 --> 01:08:32.167
Why do you insist on coming with me

01:08:33.126 --> 01:08:35.876
if you're not going to help me?

01:08:37.376 --> 01:08:39.001
I've... remembered.

01:08:39.501 --> 01:08:41.001
What did you remember?

01:08:41.667 --> 01:08:46.042
Did you remember where to find yakruna?

01:08:46.626 --> 01:08:50.417
I remembered something.
I don't know what it means.

01:08:51.459 --> 01:08:55.167
Maybe I'm not a chullachaqui anymore.

01:08:56.042 --> 01:08:57.626
Which way?

01:08:58.917 --> 01:08:59.917
Right.

01:09:24.876 --> 01:09:28.042
We're finding what you're looking for.

01:09:39.542 --> 01:09:41.251
We have to go back!

01:09:44.292 --> 01:09:46.042
We can't.

01:09:47.251 --> 01:09:49.084
They're already here.

01:10:00.584 --> 01:10:03.376
I've been here before.

01:10:44.542 --> 01:10:46.376
The Messiah is not taking visitors.

01:10:48.584 --> 01:10:50.126
We don't want to visit him.

01:10:50.209 --> 01:10:52.417
We just wish to go on our way.

01:10:52.501 --> 01:10:53.751
That is not possible.

01:10:53.834 --> 01:10:56.376
The Eden of our community
depends on its secret.

01:10:57.209 --> 01:10:59.709
We won't tell anyone.

01:11:12.667 --> 01:11:14.209
Show me that.

01:11:39.667 --> 01:11:41.334
Is this a gift?

01:11:42.792 --> 01:11:44.542
Are you the wise men of the East?

01:11:51.126 --> 01:11:53.959
But there's only two of you...
Balthazar... and Melchior...

01:11:54.459 --> 01:11:56.459
Where is Caspar?

01:11:57.501 --> 01:11:59.709
He... lost his way.

01:12:26.667 --> 01:12:28.827
He was invited to suicide
for causing with his betrayal

01:12:28.876 --> 01:12:33.501
the sickness that saddens our Eden.

01:12:49.917 --> 01:12:52.709
I'm not doing miracles today!

01:13:54.542 --> 01:13:56.376
So you're the Wise Men of the East?

01:13:57.542 --> 01:13:59.751
We are scientists,

01:13:59.834 --> 01:14:01.834
looking for sacred plants.

01:14:02.292 --> 01:14:03.959
Sacred plants?

01:14:04.876 --> 01:14:08.126
The only thing sacred
in this jungle is me!

01:14:45.167 --> 01:14:46.501
Cure her.

01:15:02.626 --> 01:15:05.292
You have to take her to a hospital.

01:15:22.876 --> 01:15:27.209
This girl has leishmaniasis.
You won't be able to cure her.

01:16:00.042 --> 01:16:01.876
The Messiah is in a bad mood today.

01:16:03.251 --> 01:16:07.042
But you have to understand,
his wife is sick. I would be upset too.

01:16:19.042 --> 01:16:20.376
I hope he can cure her.

01:16:21.001 --> 01:16:25.292
I wouldn't want for you
to be invited to suicide.

01:17:29.459 --> 01:17:31.542
This is madness.

01:17:43.709 --> 01:17:45.042
Don't you care?

01:17:46.167 --> 01:17:49.334
I do. Something went wrong.

01:17:57.917 --> 01:17:59.126
They are now

01:17:59.209 --> 01:18:04.251
the worst of both worlds.

01:18:31.959 --> 01:18:34.459
Grátias agens benedíxit.

01:18:34.542 --> 01:18:38.501
Accípite et bíbite ex eo omnes:

01:18:38.584 --> 01:18:41.376
hic est enim calix

01:18:42.209 --> 01:18:44.751
Mei sánguinis sed aetérni.

01:18:52.209 --> 01:18:53.792
Quiet!

01:18:55.584 --> 01:18:57.001
Quiet!

01:19:02.876 --> 01:19:06.584
Oh, Great Wise Men of the East

01:19:06.667 --> 01:19:10.251
who have found
the holy path to Bethlehem.

01:19:11.376 --> 01:19:13.876
Bless our drink!

01:19:52.167 --> 01:19:54.292
He cured my wife,

01:19:54.376 --> 01:19:57.292
now he will cure us all!

01:20:04.584 --> 01:20:09.334
Let us celebrate this day, brothers!

01:20:46.209 --> 01:20:47.209
Drink!

01:20:49.667 --> 01:20:50.876
Drink!

01:20:51.959 --> 01:20:55.167
I am not worthy of drinking
from the same cup as the son of God.

01:20:56.251 --> 01:20:58.001
The son of God.

01:20:58.626 --> 01:21:04.042
The son of God, I am the Messiah
and Redeemer of the Indians,

01:21:04.126 --> 01:21:07.709
Manducate ex hoc omnes! Selvus Rex!

01:21:07.792 --> 01:21:10.542
The son of God, Agnus Dei!

01:21:10.917 --> 01:21:13.042
Eat! Eat!

01:21:14.084 --> 01:21:15.376
Eat me!

01:21:27.751 --> 01:21:30.501
Everyone, eat me!

01:21:30.584 --> 01:21:33.667
Let us eat the body of the Lord!

01:22:25.917 --> 01:22:28.209
There's too much weight.

01:22:39.167 --> 01:22:41.042
What the hell are you doing?

01:22:42.542 --> 01:22:43.792
Stop bothering me!

01:22:45.376 --> 01:22:47.876
What's your problem with these boxes?

01:22:47.959 --> 01:22:51.792
Your things will only lead you
to madness and death.

01:22:52.292 --> 01:22:55.792
What are you talking about?
You poisoned them!

01:22:55.876 --> 01:22:57.334
I didn't poison them

01:22:57.417 --> 01:22:59.459
I just gave them something
to think better.

01:23:00.542 --> 01:23:04.167
They are Makús.
They were not born of the anaconda.

01:23:06.751 --> 01:23:09.334
They are less than human.

01:23:09.876 --> 01:23:12.917
You sound like
one of those rubber barons.

01:23:16.209 --> 01:23:19.001
You're just like them.
And you're lying to me.

01:23:19.709 --> 01:23:22.709
You remember everything.

01:23:35.917 --> 01:23:37.792
Don't. Please, stay.

01:23:39.751 --> 01:23:42.459
I still feel like a chullachaqui.

01:23:42.542 --> 01:23:44.792
But I'm starting to remember.

01:23:45.917 --> 01:23:49.334
My mission was to give this knowledge
to my people.

01:23:51.459 --> 01:23:54.834
But the rubber barons
and the Colombians came.

01:23:55.334 --> 01:23:58.042
And I was left alone.

01:24:00.001 --> 01:24:01.209
I need to remember.

01:24:02.501 --> 01:24:04.501
I need to continue
the song of the Cohiuano.

01:24:05.167 --> 01:24:06.876
Are you going to show me the way?

01:24:07.709 --> 01:24:10.376
I don't know it.
You have to find it for yourself.

01:24:11.959 --> 01:24:13.126
Throw away your luggage.

01:24:53.001 --> 01:24:54.292
There. Happy?

01:24:56.209 --> 01:24:57.542
Show me that box.

01:24:58.709 --> 01:25:00.834
I'm not going to let you throw it away.

01:25:03.292 --> 01:25:04.876
Then show it to me.

01:25:19.501 --> 01:25:21.084
What is it?

01:25:51.792 --> 01:25:56.709
This sound calms me.

01:25:58.501 --> 01:26:02.709
It takes me back to my father's house
in Boston, to my ancestors.

01:26:59.459 --> 01:27:04.542
To become a warrior, every Cohiuano man
must leave everything behind

01:27:04.626 --> 01:27:08.876
and go into the jungle,
guided only by his dreams.

01:27:08.959 --> 01:27:10.334
In that journey,

01:27:10.417 --> 01:27:13.876
he has to discover, in solitude
and silence, who he really is.

01:27:14.792 --> 01:27:18.626
He has to become
a vagabond of dreams.

01:27:19.584 --> 01:27:24.209
Some get lost and never come back.

01:27:24.292 --> 01:27:28.126
But those that do,

01:27:31.376 --> 01:27:33.376
are ready to face whatever may come.

01:27:34.834 --> 01:27:38.542
Where are they?

01:27:41.376 --> 01:27:43.856
Where are the chants that mothers
used to sing to their babies?

01:27:43.917 --> 01:27:46.292
Where are the stories of the elders,
the whispers of love,

01:27:46.376 --> 01:27:48.292
the chronicles of battle?

01:27:48.959 --> 01:27:50.751
Where have they gone?

01:28:08.709 --> 01:28:09.709
You dreamed.

01:28:17.751 --> 01:28:19.584
Tell me what you dreamed.

01:28:24.251 --> 01:28:25.251
I didn't.

01:28:26.542 --> 01:28:28.709
You're lying.
You saw the eyes of the jaguar.

01:28:31.167 --> 01:28:33.917
I said I didn't dream!

01:28:39.751 --> 01:28:41.501
You're afraid.

01:28:42.709 --> 01:28:44.334
But you must listen.

01:28:50.459 --> 01:28:52.667
I'm not afraid to dream.

01:28:53.209 --> 01:28:56.084
I'm afraid to die in this hellhole.

01:28:56.959 --> 01:28:59.959
You're messing with my head
with your dreams

01:29:00.042 --> 01:29:02.626
and your prohibitions.

01:29:26.251 --> 01:29:28.876
Stop. You can't fish.
There's no permission.

01:29:29.792 --> 01:29:31.334
Permission from whom?

01:29:32.084 --> 01:29:33.251
Yours?

01:29:33.667 --> 01:29:35.709
The Owner of the Fishes?

01:29:36.209 --> 01:29:40.292
I'm sick because of respecting
your ridiculous prohibitions!

01:29:41.334 --> 01:29:43.834
Easy, Theo, you're delirious.

01:29:44.584 --> 01:29:46.042
Let me go!

01:29:50.001 --> 01:29:51.709
You want to kill me too?

01:29:52.209 --> 01:29:53.876
Drop the arrow.

01:29:56.792 --> 01:29:59.584
This river is full of fish!

01:30:00.251 --> 01:30:02.459
We cannot possibly end them!

01:30:34.001 --> 01:30:35.834
How can you help him?

01:30:37.334 --> 01:30:39.376
Have you forgotten what they did to you?

01:30:39.459 --> 01:30:41.792
It wasn't him.

01:30:41.876 --> 01:30:44.042
He paid off my debt in the plantation.

01:30:45.209 --> 01:30:46.709
Then you became his slave.

01:30:47.876 --> 01:30:50.167
I ain't nobody's slave.

01:30:50.251 --> 01:30:53.417
I'm with him because we need him.
He can teach the whites.

01:30:53.501 --> 01:30:56.667
How can he learn
if he doesn't respect the jungle?

01:30:56.751 --> 01:30:59.084
He's afraid.
But he can learn.

01:30:59.167 --> 01:31:02.459
He's a hero to his people. They all
admire him and listen to his stories.

01:31:02.542 --> 01:31:05.584
If we can't get the whites to learn,
it will be the end of us.

01:31:05.667 --> 01:31:08.042
The end of everything.

01:31:24.001 --> 01:31:26.501
Kariauatinga, are you all right?

01:31:44.251 --> 01:31:47.584
They're like ants.

01:31:48.209 --> 01:31:50.334
They'll eat anything, and they die fat.

01:32:03.709 --> 01:32:06.751
You have no discipline!

01:32:08.042 --> 01:32:10.042
You'll devour everything!

01:32:18.084 --> 01:32:19.584
How is he?

01:32:22.459 --> 01:32:23.626
Better.

01:32:24.126 --> 01:32:26.501
Give him the Sun's semen.

01:32:28.334 --> 01:32:30.834
You have to help him!
You can't keep this resentment!

01:32:32.001 --> 01:32:36.251
His body's dirty again.
It would be like giving him poison.

01:32:39.709 --> 01:32:41.792
We have to arrive with my people soon.

01:32:41.876 --> 01:32:44.876
We have to talk to yakruna.
Ask it to forgive him.

01:32:44.959 --> 01:32:48.292
We are so close.

01:32:49.126 --> 01:32:52.042
You'll feel better tomorrow. Eat.

01:34:03.417 --> 01:34:05.126
It's here.

01:34:06.626 --> 01:34:08.417
To the left.

01:35:51.876 --> 01:35:52.959
Freeze!

01:35:53.042 --> 01:35:54.542
Colombian?

01:35:57.876 --> 01:35:59.667
Stop! Freeze!

01:36:04.209 --> 01:36:06.084
Are you Colombians?

01:36:07.042 --> 01:36:08.376
I don't know.

01:36:08.876 --> 01:36:10.876
Get out of here!

01:36:32.876 --> 01:36:34.376
Sirgú is here.

01:36:45.709 --> 01:36:48.709
Have a drink of yakruna.
We're toasting to the end of the world!

01:37:03.542 --> 01:37:05.709
How can you allow this?

01:37:06.834 --> 01:37:07.834
Why?

01:37:54.792 --> 01:37:57.126
Yakruna must not be cultivated...

01:38:01.876 --> 01:38:03.876
I misunderstood the signs.
They were clear.

01:38:04.792 --> 01:38:06.459
You're the one with the mandate!

01:38:06.876 --> 01:38:09.376
- You are the snake!
- Calm down!

01:38:10.876 --> 01:38:12.792
Give it back to me!

01:38:15.167 --> 01:38:17.042
You're not worthy of this!

01:38:19.292 --> 01:38:22.001
You bring hell and death to earth!

01:38:31.626 --> 01:38:33.626
The Colombians are coming!

01:38:52.417 --> 01:38:54.334
This is yakruna!

01:38:55.001 --> 01:38:57.959
The greatest knowledge
of what my people once were!

01:38:58.042 --> 01:39:00.459
I won't let you take it away.

01:39:01.292 --> 01:39:02.751
Never!

01:39:11.376 --> 01:39:13.709
The Colombians are coming!

01:43:43.417 --> 01:43:45.584
What story is it telling?

01:43:47.501 --> 01:43:50.126
How God created the world.

01:43:51.084 --> 01:43:54.459
This is the way you seek. Listen to it.

01:43:55.709 --> 01:44:00.126
It's beautiful,

01:44:00.667 --> 01:44:02.209
but it is only a story.

01:44:02.292 --> 01:44:03.959
It's not a story.

01:44:04.834 --> 01:44:07.459
It's a dream. You must follow it.

01:44:07.542 --> 01:44:10.792
I am a man of science.
Of real, palpable facts.

01:44:10.876 --> 01:44:14.834
I can't be guided
by dreams that I don't have.

01:44:15.501 --> 01:44:17.542
You do follow them.

01:44:19.917 --> 01:44:22.042
How many edges does this river have?

01:44:23.792 --> 01:44:24.792
Two.

01:44:24.876 --> 01:44:26.292
How do you know that?

01:44:28.667 --> 01:44:30.792
There's one, and there's another.

01:44:32.084 --> 01:44:34.084
One plus one equals two.

01:44:34.584 --> 01:44:36.251
How can you know that?

01:44:39.959 --> 01:44:43.876
Because! One plus one equals two.

01:44:44.834 --> 01:44:48.334
Well, you're wrong. This river
has three, five, a thousand edges.

01:44:48.667 --> 01:44:52.626
A child can understand that easily, but
not you. The river's the anaconda's son.

01:44:54.292 --> 01:44:57.042
We learn that in our dreams,
but it's the real truth,

01:44:57.792 --> 01:45:00.001
more real than what you call reality.

01:45:22.584 --> 01:45:24.751
What do you see?

01:45:25.209 --> 01:45:29.667
The world is like this, huge.

01:45:30.126 --> 01:45:32.376
But you choose to see just this.

01:45:33.001 --> 01:45:36.209
The world speaks.
I can only listen.

01:45:36.751 --> 01:45:39.376
Hear the song of your ancestors.

01:45:39.834 --> 01:45:41.334
This is the way you're looking for.

01:45:41.417 --> 01:45:43.876
Listen for real.

01:45:44.292 --> 01:45:47.292
Not only with your ears.

01:46:05.334 --> 01:46:07.084
Can I have some?

01:46:08.626 --> 01:46:11.876
You're not having anything
until you decide to listen.

01:46:16.251 --> 01:46:18.042
Can I have some caapi?

01:46:20.876 --> 01:46:25.251
Caapi won't help you
if you don't want to believe.

01:46:33.001 --> 01:46:34.542
You can help me.

01:46:37.584 --> 01:46:39.834
This is all I can do.

01:47:06.417 --> 01:47:08.792
Which way?

01:47:15.709 --> 01:47:17.126
How do you know?

01:47:19.126 --> 01:47:20.459
I know...

01:47:24.001 --> 01:47:25.376
I believe...

01:48:09.584 --> 01:48:11.417
Is that the Workshop of the Gods?

01:48:14.792 --> 01:48:16.792
This is where we had to come.

01:49:57.417 --> 01:49:58.876
Look!

01:50:17.417 --> 01:50:19.084
It is ready.

01:50:20.584 --> 01:50:22.417
What are you doing?

01:50:22.917 --> 01:50:25.751
Don't damage it. We have to store it.

01:50:25.834 --> 01:50:27.209
No.

01:50:31.334 --> 01:50:33.501
We have to make it into caapi.

01:50:37.709 --> 01:50:42.001
This is the last yakruna plant
in the world.

01:50:42.667 --> 01:50:44.876
You have to become one with it.

01:50:45.709 --> 01:50:46.959
How do you know that?

01:50:47.834 --> 01:50:50.084
I destroyed all the others.

01:50:51.876 --> 01:50:54.459
It is our last hope,

01:50:54.542 --> 01:50:58.042
my gift to you.

01:51:00.001 --> 01:51:02.292
I didn't come here for this.

01:51:02.376 --> 01:51:04.001
Yes, you did.

01:51:04.751 --> 01:51:06.542
No.

01:51:14.376 --> 01:51:17.084
There's a war out there.

01:51:23.084 --> 01:51:26.542
My people need rubber.
High-purity rubber.

01:51:29.459 --> 01:51:31.209
I have to take it with me.

01:51:31.626 --> 01:51:33.626
Did you lie to me again?

01:51:35.126 --> 01:51:39.292
You want to make weapons with yakruna?
You want to turn it into death?

01:51:41.167 --> 01:51:42.376
Give it to me.

01:52:04.084 --> 01:52:05.542
Do it. Do it!

01:52:06.501 --> 01:52:08.167
I don't care.

01:52:08.792 --> 01:52:10.751
It is my duty to die,

01:52:11.584 --> 01:52:14.209
but yakruna dies with me.

01:52:14.667 --> 01:52:18.376
You are chullachaqui too,
and you will be one forever.

01:52:51.251 --> 01:52:53.167
Take off your shirt.

01:53:06.167 --> 01:53:07.917
Let me see your back.

01:53:23.209 --> 01:53:26.126
This is the Medora caapi.

01:53:26.209 --> 01:53:28.834
The most powerful of all.

01:53:29.667 --> 01:53:31.876
It existed before creation,

01:53:32.751 --> 01:53:34.709
before the snake descended.

01:53:35.626 --> 01:53:38.709
It will take you to see her.

01:53:40.834 --> 01:53:43.626
She is enormous, fearsome.
But you must not fear it.

01:53:44.667 --> 01:53:47.834
You must let her embrace you.

01:53:49.084 --> 01:53:53.209
Her embrace
will take you to ancient places,

01:53:55.376 --> 01:54:00.876
where life doesn't exist,
not even its embryo.

01:54:18.751 --> 01:54:20.209
Drink.

01:54:26.792 --> 01:54:28.792
I... tried to kill you.

01:54:29.542 --> 01:54:31.209
I don't deserve this.

01:54:31.834 --> 01:54:33.709
I killed you too,

01:54:35.792 --> 01:54:41.334
before, in time without time,
yesterday, 40 years, maybe 100,

01:54:41.834 --> 01:54:43.792
or a million years ago.

01:54:44.292 --> 01:54:47.834
But you came back.

01:54:48.709 --> 01:54:53.459
I wasn't meant to teach my people.
I was meant to teach you.

01:55:22.834 --> 01:55:25.334
Give them more than
what they asked for.

01:55:25.417 --> 01:55:28.084
Give them a song.

01:55:28.167 --> 01:55:31.959
Tell them everything you see...
Everything you feel.

01:55:32.042 --> 01:55:34.834
Come back a whole man.

01:55:47.084 --> 01:55:49.001
You are Cohiuano.

01:59:28.251 --> 01:59:30.417
Karamakate!

02:00:54.459 --> 02:00:58.126
This film is inspired by
the travel diaries of...

02:01:05.209 --> 02:01:08.292
These diaries are the only known
accounts of many Amazonian cultures.

02:01:08.376 --> 02:01:11.751
This film is dedicated to all the
peoples whose song we will never know.

02:03:58.417 --> 02:04:01.292
