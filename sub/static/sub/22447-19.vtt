She's a phenomenal teacher.

02:48.460 --> 02:49.540
Thanks.

02:51.290 --> 02:52.620
I promised her she'd love you,

I wanted to go,
I was lookin' forward to it.

So why didn't you?

03:01.960 --> 03:03.880
Something... came up.

03:03.880 --> 03:04.880
What was it?

03:06.960 --> 03:09.420
I don't think Andi
likes me anymore.

03:09.420 --> 03:11.580
Last I heard, she thought

03:11.580 --> 03:13.250
you didn't like her.

03:13.250 --> 03:16.120
Well, now I really like her.

03:16.120 --> 03:17.670
Does she know that?

03:17.670 --> 03:19.120
I bought her a gnome.

03:19.120 --> 03:21.080
(chuckles)
A gnome is nice,

03:21.080 --> 03:22.710
but it's not
a guarantee.

03:23.920 --> 03:25.380
(sighs)

03:25.380 --> 03:27.040
I know something
she'd really like.

03:27.040 --> 03:28.500
Is it a piece of rice
with her name on it?

03:28.500 --> 03:30.670
Because I tried that, too.

03:30.670 --> 03:32.420
What, and that didn't work?

03:33.670 --> 03:35.380
No, I think you gotta
do somethin' big.

03:35.380 --> 03:38.420
-Like what?
-Like... write her a song.

03:38.420 --> 03:39.920
I can't write her a song.

03:39.920 --> 03:42.460
I had to ask her for help
signing a birthday card.

03:46.500 --> 03:48.250
-What's that for?
-The song.

03:48.250 --> 03:49.580
I just told you--

03:49.580 --> 03:50.790
It's not that hard.

03:50.790 --> 03:52.380
All right?
Two-step process.

03:52.380 --> 03:54.580
One, put your feelings
on paper.

03:54.580 --> 03:56.040
Two? Sing them.

03:56.040 --> 03:59.290
My feelings?
I don't talk
about my feelings.

03:59.290 --> 04:04.380
You just did.
All right... you like her,

04:04.380 --> 04:07.380
but you don't think
she likes you.

04:08.460 --> 04:10.040

04:10.040 --> 04:11.170
That's everything.

04:11.170 --> 04:14.000
No, no, there was
somethin' else.

04:14.000 --> 04:15.500
She used to like you.

04:15.500 --> 04:16.830
And I want her back.

04:16.830 --> 04:19.250
Yeah. That's good!

04:19.250 --> 04:21.620
I mean, this is some
solid stuff!

04:21.620 --> 04:24.290
Now we just need
to turn them into lyrics.

04:24.290 --> 04:27.830
-Okay, what is a word
that rhymes with "back"?
-Quack!

04:29.330 --> 04:33.460
Okay, what's another
non-duck-related word
that rhymes with "back"?

04:33.460 --> 04:34.830

04:37.080 --> 04:38.420
Hmm.

04:44.670 --> 04:47.920

04:47.920 --> 04:50.620
-Walker! Hey!
-What's goin' on?

04:50.620 --> 04:54.380
The usual.
Baby taters at the Spoon

04:54.380 --> 04:55.620
That sounds fun.

04:55.620 --> 05:00.620
Usually is... but Buffy's
moving away in a few days.

05:00.620 --> 05:02.670

05:08.960 --> 05:11.380
Oh, if you can, get your hands

It's very hard to be sad
around a bubble machine.

05:13.830 --> 05:16.580

I actually do have
a bubble machine.

05:16.580 --> 05:18.540

important at your house.

07:52.290 --> 07:54.210
So Noodle's dead.

Gotcha!

11:34.540 --> 11:37.500
Wait, what?
Y-- you want me to perform
the first song I ever wrote

11:37.500 --> 11:38.880
that you mostly wrote?

11:38.880 --> 11:40.040
Yeah, that's the plan.

11:40.040 --> 11:42.500
You do remember
I have panic attacks.

11:42.500 --> 11:44.790
-Right?
-But you're not gonna have any,

11:44.790 --> 11:46.040
because you're gonna be
playing guitar.

11:46.040 --> 11:48.790
Well, can't I just go to Andi's
late at night,

11:48.790 --> 11:50.540
wake her up by throwing pebbles
at her window,

11:50.540 --> 11:52.580
and sing to her
from the sidewalk?

11:52.580 --> 11:55.500
You could, but that's a cliche.

11:55.500 --> 11:59.750
-Ohh...
-Plus, when Andi hears the song
for the first time,

11:59.750 --> 12:01.960
you should be onstage.

12:01.960 --> 12:06.120
All right?

There is no punchline!
The business wasn't
doing well,

it wasn't even that much.

17:49.540 --> 17:52.540
You bought... the Fringe?

17:52.540 --> 17:55.210

and you didn't.

17:55.210 --> 17:57.210

And that's okay.

18:29.830 --> 18:32.210

at shows, too.

18:32.210 --> 18:33.670

18:33.670 --> 18:34.920
Tell me.

18:34.920 --> 18:37.080
