00:13.095 --> 00:15.061
Hey Sinbad, do you have
any idea where we're going?

00:15.063 --> 00:18.098
Nope. Why should
I start that now?

00:18.100 --> 00:21.037
Hold up, Hold up,
Hold up, Hold up.

00:24.707 --> 00:27.407
Is my treasure hunting
interfering with your online
dating?

00:27.409 --> 00:29.976
As a matter a
fact, it is.

00:29.978 --> 00:33.079
I want to see what kind
of women are available here.

00:33.081 --> 00:35.016
You know, you mind
shutting that thing that's below
your nose?

00:35.018 --> 00:38.088
It's making a lot of noise.
I'm trying to focus here, man.

00:40.022 --> 00:41.724
What is this?

00:57.306 --> 00:59.139
You can't die yet.

00:59.141 --> 01:00.743
You still owe me a
thousand bucks.

01:04.714 --> 01:06.746
Leave it. A
millennia from now maybe

01:06.748 --> 01:09.082
two guys will find it, convince
somebody it's a historic relic

01:09.084 --> 01:11.284
and make a big pile of money.

01:11.286 --> 01:14.754
But what if--
No. Nothing.
Come on. I found it.

01:14.756 --> 01:16.059
Man.

01:18.894 --> 01:20.931
This is where he hide.

01:26.001 --> 01:28.936
Wait. So Perseus hid his
treasure in Mexico?

01:28.938 --> 01:30.671
This place wasn't called
Mexico back then.

01:30.673 --> 01:34.745
Perseus was just staring at a
big black map looking for a
place to hide his fortune.

01:35.178 --> 01:39.046
You see, when the kid who killed
medusa be came an old man,

01:39.048 --> 01:41.882
he went crazy with Dementia.

01:41.884 --> 01:44.251
He was convinced Zeus was
after his fortune.

01:44.253 --> 01:48.823
So he packed up his ship and
spent 10 years searching for the
perfect place to hide it.

01:48.825 --> 01:51.862
Eventually, he hoarded all his
wealth up in a cave.

01:54.429 --> 01:56.098
This cave.

01:56.899 --> 02:00.100
Wait, so Perseus discovered
the New World?

02:00.102 --> 02:01.971
Yeah. It's all in my book.

02:02.337 --> 02:04.138
At least what should be my book.

02:04.140 --> 02:07.711
Sinbad, not now.

02:08.844 --> 02:11.009
How did we even get
in this place?

02:11.012 --> 02:13.717
Same way Perseus killed Medusa.

02:18.421 --> 02:20.223
Through the neck.

02:25.494 --> 02:27.396
Open sesame.

02:40.475 --> 02:42.812
The treasure of Perseus.

02:50.786 --> 02:56.826
Whoo.
What? Oh yeah.

03:11.940 --> 03:14.808
Someone's been here.
Recently.

03:14.810 --> 03:16.011
Why didn't they take nothing?

03:16.411 --> 03:20.414
Probably some academic moron who
wants to preserve this place.

03:20.416 --> 03:21.949
How do you even know that?

03:21.951 --> 03:24.919
Because I use to be one of those
academic morons.

03:24.921 --> 03:26.523
Let's hurry.

03:29.058 --> 03:31.528
Oh yeah. That's nice.
That's nice.

03:38.034 --> 03:41.568
That's nasty, man. Look,
just leave it, alright?
Let's just go.

03:41.570 --> 03:42.836
No, no, no.

03:42.838 --> 03:44.872
This bitch made it personal.

03:44.874 --> 03:48.408
I'm going to sell this thing and
buy a yacht the size of a
football field.

04:04.626 --> 04:07.127
Hi.
We were just browsing.

04:07.129 --> 04:09.896
What kind of return policy do
you guys have?

04:09.898 --> 04:13.202
Who are you?
- We were just leaving.

04:14.035 --> 04:15.271
RUN!

04:18.173 --> 04:19.440
Want that?

04:29.451 --> 04:31.187
Ha Ha!

04:34.422 --> 04:36.091
Get him!

04:38.895 --> 04:40.297
Go! Go! Go!

04:42.297 --> 04:44.066
Oh, come on.

04:50.071 --> 04:52.408
Whoo!

05:05.287 --> 05:08.290
That kid just stole the next
atom bomb.

05:08.691 --> 05:10.360
I want it back.

05:10.960 --> 05:16.967
Find him immediately.
Understood?
-Yeah.

05:20.035 --> 05:21.571
Left this though.

05:25.975 --> 05:27.510
Oh.

05:29.011 --> 05:33.079
You should log into his
Facebook. Say something stupid.
-Ssh! Don't talk.

06:37.612 --> 06:41.615
Ten thousand dollar.
My final offer.
The gold alone
is worth that.

06:41.617 --> 06:45.119
Fine. The new price is nine
thousand.
-Nine? What happened to ten?

06:45.121 --> 06:47.120
You annoy me.
Service charge.

06:47.122 --> 06:49.790
Wait, have you actually sucked
the life right out of a man?

06:49.792 --> 06:52.393
Because right now I feel like I
w ant a divorce and we're not
even married.

06:52.395 --> 06:57.096
So go sell it somewhere
else. But I doubt they'll
give you cash today.

06:57.098 --> 06:59.632
Come on. Throw in some
hazard pay? I almost go
shot getting this.

06:59.634 --> 07:02.136
Who did you try to
kill for this?

07:02.138 --> 07:03.504
They tried to kill me.

07:03.506 --> 07:04.672
Were they government?

07:04.674 --> 07:07.273
No. Fortune hunters like me.
Big guy had an eye patch.

07:07.275 --> 07:11.745
The other was wearing
a thingy. Like--
-The other one...

07:11.747 --> 07:16.216
Was he a bit of a...dandy?

07:16.218 --> 07:18.351
Do you interrupt everybody's
conversations?

07:18.353 --> 07:24.193
I was going to introduce you
after our deal. Sinbad, meet
Ace Adar.

07:25.727 --> 07:28.327
I'm an aficionado of you,
young man.

07:28.329 --> 07:30.329
Well that sound a little
bit dirty.
-No.

07:30.331 --> 07:34.603
Half of my collections at home
are pieces you've found and sold
to Lyta here.

07:35.237 --> 07:37.603
Anything of interest?

07:37.605 --> 07:40.206
No artifacts this time.
Just gems.

07:40.208 --> 07:44.211
"Just gems." Lyta, give me what
I need for my boat so I can
leave town

07:44.213 --> 07:45.812
and end our torrid love affair.

07:45.814 --> 07:49.319
Ooh!
-Ooh! You hurt so good.

07:49.852 --> 07:53.687
Careful. That gave me a
chemical burn when I
touched it.

07:53.689 --> 07:55.425
Oh.

07:56.425 --> 07:57.727
Fascinating.

07:58.160 --> 07:59.660
Do you know what this is?

07:59.662 --> 08:01.364
Oh, Oh yes.

08:01.564 --> 08:04.634
I believe you found the
Heart of Medusa.

08:04.867 --> 08:08.735
Legend says that while her eyes
could turn a man to stone,

08:08.737 --> 08:11.504
her heart could turn the
world to stone.

08:11.506 --> 08:14.440
Sounds like a premium
price to me.

08:14.442 --> 08:15.875
Wow.

08:15.877 --> 08:18.211
I'll give you twenty five
thousand for the stone.

08:18.213 --> 08:21.214
Ooh, and double for the
scimitar.

08:21.216 --> 08:22.682
This isn't for sale.

08:22.684 --> 08:24.151
No?

08:24.153 --> 08:25.388
No.

08:27.189 --> 08:29.223
Some things can't be bought.

08:29.225 --> 08:30.456
Blasphemy!

08:30.458 --> 08:31.591
My Dad gave this to me.

08:31.593 --> 08:34.427
He said it was handed down by
Old SIndibad himself.

08:34.429 --> 08:39.166
Wait. Seven Seas-Arabian
Knights Sindibad?

08:39.168 --> 08:43.073
Maybe. All I know for sure is
that it's a great way to open up
champagne bottles.

08:44.439 --> 08:45.339
Ah. Oof.

08:45.341 --> 08:47.474
If that's the true Scimitar
Sindibad,

08:47.476 --> 08:49.876
they opened up throats of
both men and demigods.

08:49.878 --> 08:52.211
I don't believe in any of that.
My Dad did.

08:52.213 --> 08:54.214
He even said I look like him.

08:54.216 --> 08:55.849
You do.

08:55.851 --> 08:57.352
Look.

08:58.686 --> 09:01.190
See. Here.

09:01.589 --> 09:05.792
You must forgive me. I forget
that trinkets I collect are
family heirlooms.

09:05.794 --> 09:08.865
I have more of your history at
my home in Los Angeles.

09:09.430 --> 09:10.898
That's okay.
You keep it.

09:10.900 --> 09:13.232
No, no. I insist.

09:13.234 --> 09:18.340
It hasn't brought me luck. Maybe
it'll make your wish come true.

09:20.675 --> 09:22.576
See, already working.

09:22.578 --> 09:24.280
Hey!

09:25.314 --> 09:27.416
I'm the buyer.
You're the seller.

09:27.683 --> 09:31.588
You keep talking dirty to me,
Lyta. You're turning me on.

09:33.454 --> 09:35.889
And if you're serious about
buying a boat,

09:35.891 --> 09:39.429
may I suggest you do so
and lay low.

09:39.962 --> 09:45.631
The men who I met at the cave.
The "dandy." You know them?

09:45.633 --> 09:47.402
Yes, I do.

09:47.870 --> 09:49.606
He sounds like Manta.

09:51.040 --> 09:52.972
Another collector of rare
antiquities. Except for one
difference.

09:52.974 --> 09:54.908
Not as weird?

09:54.910 --> 09:58.477
To me, artifacts are a
taste of history.

09:58.479 --> 10:02.682
But to Manta, they are weapons
of magical destruction.

10:02.684 --> 10:06.419
Weapons? Come on,
you believe that?

10:06.421 --> 10:08.688
No, no, no.
But Manta does.

10:08.690 --> 10:13.427
Rumors are he slaughtered
an entire Amazon tribe with
the amulet of

10:13.429 --> 10:16.462
Silverado in an attempt
to look eternally young.

10:16.464 --> 10:18.398
Trust me. It didn't work.

10:18.400 --> 10:19.899
Why didn't he just use
photoshop?

10:19.901 --> 10:24.538
You joke now. But Manta is
deadly serious about his
tactics.

10:24.540 --> 10:28.241
Well then let's get together
and kick this guy's ass.

10:28.243 --> 10:30.379
- I ain't afraid of him.
- You should be.

10:31.713 --> 10:38.420
I'm leaving for California
tonight. I'm curious to find out
more why Manta wants this stone.

10:38.987 --> 10:41.254
Please join me.

10:41.256 --> 10:42.822
My estate is secluded
and off the grid.

10:42.824 --> 10:45.792
You'll be safe if Manta
chooses to look for you.

10:45.794 --> 10:48.394
I'm not hiding from this guy.
Especially not in LA.

10:48.396 --> 10:50.998
If Manta messes with me,
I'll mess back.

10:51.000 --> 10:54.301
Besides, this time tomorrow
I'll be half-way to Chile.

10:54.303 --> 10:57.504
Well if you reconsider,

10:57.506 --> 11:00.673
you always have an ally and
a confidant in me.

11:00.675 --> 11:02.475
Like you I keep a low profile,

11:02.477 --> 11:05.278
but you can always find my
consignment shop in

11:05.280 --> 11:07.913
the city's Tehrangeles market.

11:07.915 --> 11:09.482
That's my card.

11:09.484 --> 11:11.518
Lyta, always a pleasure.

11:11.520 --> 11:12.889
Good luck to you.

11:25.534 --> 11:28.034
I already took out my
twenty percent.

11:28.036 --> 11:30.003
Why are you giving me more?

11:30.005 --> 11:32.976
Consider it my donation to the
"Snarky Bitch Club."

11:47.990 --> 11:50.760
So how we make out?
- We got enough for the boat.

11:52.460 --> 11:53.226
The good one.

11:53.228 --> 11:55.828
Aye, aye, captain.

11:55.830 --> 11:59.999
So we'll set sail tomorrow.
Or we could go north?

12:00.001 --> 12:01.701
I'm never going back to
the United States.

12:01.703 --> 12:03.602
What?
-Hey.

12:03.604 --> 12:05.574
Do you think I look
like this guy?

12:06.507 --> 12:09.942
Nah. He's actually
good looking.

12:09.944 --> 12:11.510
Really?

12:11.512 --> 12:13.679
Pack up. We're leaving in
the morning.

12:13.681 --> 12:15.215
Why so soon?

12:15.217 --> 12:18.451
You want to be around if eye
patch and that Russian guy track
us back here?

12:18.453 --> 12:20.455
Good point.

12:23.858 --> 12:26.092
Weapons of magical destruction.

12:26.094 --> 12:29.364
WMDs.

12:51.953 --> 12:54.620
Hola.

12:54.622 --> 12:55.757
Jax?

12:56.824 --> 12:58.759
What are you trying
to do kill me?

12:58.761 --> 13:00.427
Why are you sneaking
in here?

13:00.429 --> 13:02.432
I didn't think you'd be home.

13:03.732 --> 13:05.535
Oh God.

13:05.800 --> 13:07.804
Here, I'll get you some ice.

13:08.469 --> 13:09.939
How did you find me?

13:11.607 --> 13:13.706
Who did you think I was-
The cops?

13:13.708 --> 13:16.578
Yes. I mean, no.

13:18.780 --> 13:20.413
Ow!

13:20.415 --> 13:21.581
There.

13:21.583 --> 13:22.517
Does that feel better?

13:23.549 --> 13:23.582
You're making it worse.

13:23.584 --> 13:25.652
Oh, you big baby.

13:25.654 --> 13:28.691
Just hold it on there
for a minute.
-There's no bag.

13:31.859 --> 13:33.192
Jax.

13:33.194 --> 13:34.461
What are you doing here?

13:35.865 --> 13:39.899
Well I'm spending the
summer here studying old
missionary customs.

13:39.901 --> 13:43.135
And then when I saw
you were also here--
-No one knows I'm here.

13:43.137 --> 13:45.004
You have a
snapchat account.

13:45.006 --> 13:49.978
With pictures of yourself
in San Lucas.

13:50.846 --> 13:53.816
- I like they way the
filters make me look.

13:54.516 --> 13:55.749
Yeah.

13:55.751 --> 14:00.086
Well, I hope that you're not
that upset that I brought it.

14:00.088 --> 14:02.022
I thought it might help
patch things up.

14:02.024 --> 14:03.456
Patch things up?

14:03.458 --> 14:05.759
Okay. Maybe patch is
the wrong word.

14:05.761 --> 14:08.528
Pants can be patched.
Tires can be patched.

14:08.530 --> 14:12.198
You can find pumpkins in a
patch. But my reputation--

14:12.200 --> 14:15.902
I'm sorry! Look, how many times
do I have to say that I'm sorry.

14:15.904 --> 14:17.637
I'm sorry that your father
ruined my reputation.

14:17.639 --> 14:19.505
You can't blame him forever.

14:19.507 --> 14:21.707
He stole my work and then blames
me for what he stole.

14:21.709 --> 14:24.811
Okay. You know what,
you're right.

14:24.813 --> 14:27.246
It was a stupid
thing to do.

14:27.248 --> 14:30.484
He was afraid he'd
lose tenure.

14:30.486 --> 14:32.918
Well I lost my degree
and now spend my time
hiding from the law.

14:32.920 --> 14:35.788
That was your choice, Sinbad.
-Was it?

14:35.790 --> 14:38.225
Sinbad, you stole the
university's collection

14:38.227 --> 14:41.794
of Egyptian dynasty
gems and then you sold
them online.

14:41.796 --> 14:46.668
- Because I was very,
very upset.

14:50.606 --> 14:53.273
Are you trying to
decapitate me?

14:53.275 --> 14:54.944
Jealous of my skills?

14:55.511 --> 15:00.683
Oh yeah. I am just heartbroken
over you skills.

15:01.149 --> 15:02.952
Seriously, Sinbad.

15:03.285 --> 15:07.287
You could have been the
greatest archeological
professor in the world.

15:07.289 --> 15:09.891
Now you're just a
lousy thief.

15:10.925 --> 15:14.159
I prefer the term
undercover entrepreneur.

15:14.161 --> 15:15.495
Oh really?

15:15.497 --> 15:18.532
Then how come you can't do
any better than selling

15:18.534 --> 15:22.635
buried treasure to old
crone Lyta downtown, huh?

15:22.637 --> 15:24.538
At least I'm honest
about who I am.

15:24.540 --> 15:25.908
- Well.

15:26.574 --> 15:29.075
He did put you
in the book.

15:29.077 --> 15:30.780
See.

15:32.113 --> 15:35.150
"Special thanks to
Sinbad Siridad."

15:35.851 --> 15:37.620
Really?

15:42.757 --> 15:46.194
I want to help you start over.

15:47.862 --> 15:49.763
Why?

15:49.765 --> 15:52.097
Because if you really wanted to
be a criminal,

15:52.099 --> 15:55.704
then I wouldn't still be
in love with you.

15:58.806 --> 16:00.509
Okay.

16:04.579 --> 16:06.615
Here's my "special thanks."

16:16.123 --> 16:20.059
And then out of nowhere, this
cyclops comes running--
-He wasn't a cyclops.

16:20.061 --> 16:22.696
It was a bloody cyclops.
Just because a guy
wears an eye patch

16:22.698 --> 16:25.230
doesn't make him a "cyclops."
-I bet he was born with one eye.

16:25.232 --> 16:26.798
Well, you only
have one ball.

16:26.800 --> 16:31.303
Sinbad and his bad jokes.
Remember buddy, I own half the
deed on this mine.

16:31.305 --> 16:33.974
- I know.
- So we set sail tomorrow.

16:33.976 --> 16:36.208
Alright, well we have a 90 foot
schooner.

16:36.210 --> 16:39.645
It's a traditional Turkish motor
sailer with a transform stern.

16:39.647 --> 16:42.081
Technically, it's a 35 foot
fishing boat with an off
board motor.

16:42.083 --> 16:45.619
Do we have a crew?
-Are we just gonna go with those
dudes you found on Craigslist?

16:45.621 --> 16:47.052
You know they
work cheap.

16:47.054 --> 16:48.623
Sebastian?

16:53.628 --> 16:55.361
As long as you're on board,
I'm fine.

16:55.363 --> 16:57.730
Wait. So you're going to
trust a deaf guy over me?

16:57.732 --> 17:00.033
Any day. No one's more
trustworthy than a man

17:00.035 --> 17:01.701
who can't hear anything.

17:01.703 --> 17:03.869
Was that even sign language?
 -Nah.

17:03.871 --> 17:05.171
Sebastian reads lips.

17:05.173 --> 17:07.343
I was just trying to
look smart.
-Hmm.

17:07.776 --> 17:09.111
See you tomorrow.

17:12.646 --> 17:17.953
The rest of you, godspeed
and wadaeaan.

17:18.752 --> 17:19.685
Wadaeaan?

17:19.686 --> 17:20.554
I'm embracing my culture.

17:20.556 --> 17:22.320
So now you're embracing
your culture?

17:22.323 --> 17:25.126
Help me pack up the rest of this
stuff. Just the essentials.

17:30.098 --> 17:32.268
Hmm.

17:36.905 --> 17:38.674
See you on the boat,
baby.

17:45.146 --> 17:46.846
Really?

17:46.848 --> 17:47.747
What?

17:47.749 --> 17:48.948
I thought we were gonna,

17:48.950 --> 17:53.019
explore the women of the world
and screw the seven seas.

17:53.021 --> 17:55.387
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I mean,
still gonna do that.

17:55.389 --> 17:57.222
With your girlfriend
around?

17:57.224 --> 17:59.925
Nah. Well, you know, she--
she's like--

17:59.927 --> 18:02.162
You bought her a flower.
You're in love.

18:02.164 --> 18:03.163
I'm- I'm not in love.

18:03.165 --> 18:04.897
You are hopelessly devoted.

18:04.899 --> 18:07.703
No. I'm just...

18:07.935 --> 18:09.803
yeah. Yeah.
I'm in love.

18:09.805 --> 18:11.203
But she's coming with us,
alright?

18:11.205 --> 18:14.274
It's my boat, too. So do you
have a problem with that?

18:14.276 --> 18:16.175
No.

18:16.177 --> 18:18.044
Very chivalrous
of you.

18:18.046 --> 18:20.279
- I'm going to take
a shower.

18:20.281 --> 18:22.885
She's a lucky lady,
Nicky boy!
Yeah. Yeah.

18:28.322 --> 18:30.289
May we come in?

18:30.291 --> 18:32.093
Nick!

18:33.161 --> 18:34.730
Get out of the shower.

18:35.396 --> 18:36.698
Now.

18:36.897 --> 18:39.367
The Heart of Medusa.

18:40.001 --> 18:41.737
We know you stole it.

18:47.943 --> 18:49.110
What?

18:50.244 --> 18:52.479
Remember Cyclops and the
Russian guy we met at the cave?

18:52.481 --> 18:54.446
Yeah?

18:54.448 --> 19:00.153
I think they sent Charlie's
pissed off angels to get their
stuff back.

19:00.155 --> 19:02.458
What? Dude, there's
nothing right there?

19:11.133 --> 19:13.199
Let me ask one more time.

19:13.201 --> 19:15.201
Or do you prefer a
different language.

19:15.203 --> 19:19.506
- Where is the Heart of Medusa?

19:19.508 --> 19:22.812
I don't have what you want.

19:23.811 --> 19:26.980
I still smell her
heart on you.

19:26.982 --> 19:30.349
The stone's residue
sours the skin.

19:30.351 --> 19:32.519
I didn't hold anyone's heart.

19:32.521 --> 19:38.293
How can you lie when the proof
is branded on your skin?

19:41.029 --> 19:45.298
If you're talking about the
emerald, I sold it.

19:45.300 --> 19:47.235
Who did you give it to?

19:52.808 --> 19:55.008
This one's a fighter.

19:55.010 --> 19:58.012
Manipulate the coward instead.

20:00.147 --> 20:06.986
Tell us where the heart is. Or
rip your friend's out instead.

20:06.988 --> 20:08.288
Why just his heart?

20:08.290 --> 20:13.058
When he has such other
such delicate intimacies
we can rip open.

20:13.060 --> 20:14.426
I sold the damn thing.

20:14.428 --> 20:18.431
To who?
- To a woman who I thought was
the world's biggest bitch.

20:18.433 --> 20:20.866
Until you walked in
the door.

20:20.868 --> 20:22.902
Ow!

20:22.904 --> 20:25.974
Man, come one, Sinbad. Man,
Stop pissing them off!

20:28.242 --> 20:31.146
Look, it was Lyta.
Lyta!

20:31.346 --> 20:33.179
How do we know you're
not lying?

20:33.181 --> 20:35.417
Because this one is crying.

20:36.251 --> 20:37.983
Who the hell are you guys?

20:37.985 --> 20:42.323
You're a man. You don't get
to ask me questions.

20:48.495 --> 20:50.496
You're Arabian?

20:50.498 --> 20:52.434
You know him?

20:53.300 --> 20:55.567
You ladies want this, too?

20:55.569 --> 20:58.605
What do you think this place is-
QVC?

20:58.607 --> 21:01.374
When I get that stone back,

21:01.376 --> 21:04.376
I'm coming back here to break
open your head

21:04.378 --> 21:08.413
the same way it broke mine.
-And mine!

21:17.925 --> 21:20.128
Sinbad?

21:27.402 --> 21:28.902
It's Lyta.

21:31.539 --> 21:33.439
- It's still there.
- Huh?

21:33.441 --> 21:35.508
What a nightmare.

22:15.684 --> 22:17.951
I know who did this.

22:17.953 --> 22:20.553
They think it was an
animal attack.

22:20.555 --> 22:22.555
I had no idea they'd
kill her.

22:22.557 --> 22:24.457
Who?

22:24.459 --> 22:26.125
Three women.

22:26.127 --> 22:30.198
They knocked me out before I
could her they were coming for
the emerald they sold.

22:30.397 --> 22:33.132
Why didn't they
come back for me?

22:33.134 --> 22:36.336
I should tell them.
-No, wait.

22:36.338 --> 22:37.738
You're on probation.

22:37.740 --> 22:42.508
They'll probably just blame
you so they have an easy
case to close.

22:42.510 --> 22:44.676
I can't stand back
and do nothing.

22:44.678 --> 22:48.647
Okay. Well, why don't
you try telling them
what's going on?

22:48.649 --> 22:51.219
The I can see
if I can help.

22:51.685 --> 22:55.087
So what's so special about
this amulet that you had?

22:55.089 --> 22:58.590
Someone told me it's the
Heart of Medusa.

22:58.592 --> 23:01.462
The Heart of Medusa?

23:02.062 --> 23:03.596
Oh my God.

23:03.598 --> 23:05.765
Who all knows that
you have this?

23:05.767 --> 23:08.334
I was chased down
by a Russian guy.

23:08.336 --> 23:11.371
Manta?
Manta Marquis?

23:11.373 --> 23:12.939
How do you know
about him?

23:12.941 --> 23:16.409
I was the one who told him where
to find the Heart of Medusa in
the first place.

23:16.411 --> 23:20.512
You told someone else of my
theory of Perseus burying his
treasure out here?

23:20.514 --> 23:23.685
Okay. I's not just
your theory.

23:26.553 --> 23:28.688
Look, we shouldn't talk here.

23:28.690 --> 23:33.195
It's not safe.
Let's go to my office.

23:43.704 --> 23:45.206
That's them.

23:46.040 --> 23:47.443
Who are they?

23:48.609 --> 23:51.076
The Furies.

23:51.078 --> 23:55.280
The living manifestations
if vengeance,

23:55.282 --> 23:57.115
Jealousy,

23:57.117 --> 23:59.288
and unresting rage.

23:59.587 --> 24:02.188
So Manta hired three look
a-likes to scare me into

24:02.190 --> 24:04.323
giving back the
Heart of Medusa?

24:04.325 --> 24:06.362
That guy is sick.

24:08.262 --> 24:10.195
And you led them to me.

24:10.197 --> 24:15.036
Or maybe she
led you to me.

24:15.803 --> 24:17.670
What the hell are
you doing here?

24:17.672 --> 24:20.539
I came to render additional
services from the doctor,

24:20.541 --> 24:26.348
but instead I find her
keeping interesting company.

24:26.548 --> 24:28.550
What's going on?

24:29.451 --> 24:31.384
You two know each other?

24:31.386 --> 24:32.684
We had a deal.

24:32.686 --> 24:35.288
Or so I thought.

24:35.290 --> 24:38.825
Manta hired me to map out
a potential location of
Medusa's heart.

24:38.827 --> 24:40.492
And when Dad's book was
published--

24:40.494 --> 24:43.064
A book based on my theories.

24:43.263 --> 24:46.467
A lot of people came out
looking for treasure.

24:46.701 --> 24:50.403
Fortune hunters like Manta
hire me all the time to help
them map out spots.

24:50.405 --> 24:53.306
I had no idea he'd
actually find it.

24:53.308 --> 24:56.145
But I did.

24:56.711 --> 25:02.448
And now I find you coercing
with the man who stole it. Why?

25:02.450 --> 25:06.588
No. You tell me why you killed
Lyta to get it back.

25:07.121 --> 25:08.755
Or maybe you know?

25:08.757 --> 25:12.724
How dare you accuse me of
being involved in that. I
don't even know this guy.

25:12.726 --> 25:15.795
Once he paid me for the map,
I was done with him.

25:15.797 --> 25:19.298
I've spilled no blood.
Yet.

25:19.300 --> 25:21.334
You just have your
women do it for you.

25:25.205 --> 25:27.573
I don't associate with
the newer sex.

25:27.575 --> 25:32.278
They're devious, as the
good doctor proves.
Where is the stone?

25:32.280 --> 25:36.214
Lyta sold it. Ask her.
Oh, wait. You can't,

25:36.216 --> 25:37.650
because she's kind
of dead now.

25:37.652 --> 25:41.287
Its too bad. I thought
you might know.

25:41.289 --> 25:44.490
Kill them.
Starting with her.

26:21.529 --> 26:22.361
You okay?

26:22.363 --> 26:26.201
I am the great Manta.

26:29.303 --> 26:30.469
Wow.

26:30.471 --> 26:32.907
He's so strong, AHH!

26:45.353 --> 26:47.756
So we're getting a boat and
leaving tonight, right?

26:48.956 --> 26:51.390
In this storm? No way.

26:51.392 --> 26:52.624
We have to wait
till morning.

26:52.626 --> 26:54.794
But what if Manta
find us here?

26:54.796 --> 26:59.999
Trust me. If Manta finds us in
here we are more than prepared.

27:04.705 --> 27:07.405
What's wrong?

27:07.407 --> 27:10.242
What is it?
-That guy threw one
hell of a punch.

27:10.244 --> 27:12.613
Here. Let me see it.

27:18.919 --> 27:20.819
Does that hurt?

27:20.821 --> 27:23.888
A little bit.
-Yeah.

27:23.890 --> 27:27.328
Yeah. It's a
little blue.

27:28.396 --> 27:30.398
No. Doesn't hurt.

27:32.834 --> 27:35.634
So who did you sell the
Heart of Medusa to?

27:35.636 --> 27:38.506
Never you mind who I
sold that heart to.

27:43.478 --> 27:45.044
Sinbad, I'm serious.

27:45.046 --> 27:48.580
What's to stop Manta from
going after that guy?

27:48.582 --> 27:50.016
We made a deal under
the table.

27:50.018 --> 27:51.951
Lyta doesn't keep records.

27:51.953 --> 27:55.453
There's no way Manta can
find out who it is.

27:55.455 --> 27:57.789
Don't you think you should
warn the buyer?

27:57.791 --> 28:00.561
This buyers isn't
afraid of Manta.

28:03.598 --> 28:06.335
And I don't want you
to be either.

28:06.634 --> 28:13.675
I am. I feel responsible for
getting you into this mess.

28:14.341 --> 28:16.310
Well make it up to me.

28:21.348 --> 28:22.882
What?

28:22.884 --> 28:25.753
You afraid of remembering how
much you like kissing me?

28:28.556 --> 28:32.325
No. I just don't want to
lose you again.

28:32.327 --> 28:35.060
I'm not gonna let
anyone hurt you.

28:35.062 --> 28:38.064
It's not me that I'm
worried about.

28:38.066 --> 28:39.699
It's you.

28:39.701 --> 28:41.701
Why?

28:41.703 --> 28:43.868
Someone has to
worry about you.

28:43.870 --> 28:45.906
Right?

28:57.952 --> 28:59.855
Jax.

29:00.954 --> 29:03.425
Damn girl. I missed you
so much.

29:04.959 --> 29:06.659
Hello, lover.

29:06.661 --> 29:07.992
You lied.

29:09.629 --> 29:13.968
One more time.
We want the heart.

29:18.539 --> 29:21.009
I told you, I don't have it.

29:24.811 --> 29:26.077
If you won't tell us,

29:26.079 --> 29:28.617
We'll have to pull it out of
his whore instead.

29:36.723 --> 29:38.624
Is it in there?

29:44.799 --> 29:46.399
Enough!

29:56.676 --> 29:58.144
What was that?

29:58.146 --> 30:00.179
Alright.

30:00.181 --> 30:03.182
Everyone on the boat.
We're leaving right now.

30:03.184 --> 30:04.650
Shouldn't we call the cops?

30:04.652 --> 30:06.684
Yeah. I'd love to see how
they'd handle this.

30:06.686 --> 30:09.521
Everyone wants this stone so
bad and I want to find out why.

30:09.523 --> 30:11.525
If anyone knows,
it's this Ace dude.

30:13.627 --> 30:15.763
Voicemail.
-Shoot.

30:15.963 --> 30:17.762
Ace, this is Sinbad.

30:17.764 --> 30:19.565
I'm taking you up on that
offer you made me.

30:19.567 --> 30:22.034
Hide that stone I sold you.
Manta is after it.

30:22.036 --> 30:23.769
And the Furies.

30:23.771 --> 30:26.471
It's going to take me about two
days to get to your shop.

30:26.473 --> 30:30.912
You said if I ever got in
trouble I'd be safe with you.
I hope you meant it.

30:31.479 --> 30:32.811
You in?

30:32.813 --> 30:35.181
Well I'm not sticking
around here.

30:35.183 --> 30:38.217
Plus, I'd like to see the
Heart of Medusa for myself.

30:38.219 --> 30:40.618
Yeah. I'm coming with
you. Me and the fellas,
we got your back.

30:40.620 --> 30:42.721
And me.
-Baby, no.

30:42.723 --> 30:44.022
You're leaving me
here by myself?

30:44.024 --> 30:47.559
I will not put the woman that I
want to propose to in danger.

30:49.830 --> 30:51.730
This is how you propose?
-I will propose

30:51.732 --> 30:54.469
when I get back, baby.
I promise.

30:56.937 --> 30:58.636
I hope you're worth it.

30:58.638 --> 31:00.105
You and me both.

31:00.107 --> 31:02.778
Let's get our asses to
Los Angeles.

31:13.921 --> 31:16.721
Hey. Keep an eye
on those RPMs.

31:16.723 --> 31:18.757
We lose this engine we'll
be sitting ducks.

31:18.759 --> 31:20.526
You know if you didn't have
such a criminal records,

31:20.528 --> 31:21.861
we could have flown there.

31:21.863 --> 31:24.797
And miss all this
aquatic comradery?

31:24.799 --> 31:26.465
Yeah. Yeah, you're right.

31:26.467 --> 31:30.903
We're about an hour ahead of
schedule. If you can keep
this up all day and night,

31:30.905 --> 31:34.175
we should be in Los Angeles
about dawn.

31:35.276 --> 31:38.943
Hey. It's going to be okay.

31:38.945 --> 31:40.778
You're not alone in this.

31:40.780 --> 31:42.515
Not with me around.

31:42.517 --> 31:43.781
Yeah, I know.

31:52.092 --> 31:54.960
Look. Dolphins.

31:54.962 --> 31:56.862
They're a good omen.

31:56.864 --> 31:58.066
How so?

31:59.834 --> 32:02.067
When pirates attacked Dionysus,

32:02.069 --> 32:03.568
she turned them into Dolphins.

32:03.570 --> 32:10.645
And then she charged them
with helping sailors,
instead of harming them.

32:11.011 --> 32:12.912
Sweet story.

32:12.914 --> 32:15.047
Too bad it's not true.

32:15.049 --> 32:19.018
I think that what we saw last
night, it can all be true.

32:19.020 --> 32:22.320
What you call magic,
I call science.

32:22.322 --> 32:25.924
Okay, then how do you explain
what those women turned into?

32:25.926 --> 32:27.826
I mean, they flew away.

32:27.828 --> 32:31.829
Biotechnological weaponry.
Manta's Russian after all.

32:31.831 --> 32:38.170
That is paranoid and
delusional thinking. What are
you, an American?

32:38.172 --> 32:41.140
And you believing in gods and
goddesses and

32:41.142 --> 32:45.146
magic dolphins isn't paranoid
and delusional thinking?

32:47.748 --> 32:51.152
As always, logic wins
the debate.

32:51.685 --> 32:52.953
You want science?

32:53.854 --> 32:55.253
Fine.

32:55.255 --> 32:57.291
Come on.

32:57.857 --> 32:59.293
Come on!

33:00.860 --> 33:02.961
You ever study
numerology?

33:02.963 --> 33:05.300
That's on my list of
things never to do.

33:06.067 --> 33:09.201
Well when they showed up at
your door that first night,

33:09.203 --> 33:11.069
you know what time
it was?

33:11.071 --> 33:13.172
I don't know. Late.
Real late.

33:13.174 --> 33:16.040
Was it after 3:30?

33:16.042 --> 33:17.779
Sure.

33:19.312 --> 33:22.381
When those two women
grabbed me last night, I
happened to look at the clock.

33:22.383 --> 33:25.220
It was exactly 3:33.

33:25.653 --> 33:27.152
Now there's 3 women.

33:27.154 --> 33:31.056
That's one Roma numeral
for each woman.

33:31.058 --> 33:36.565
Now, 3+3+3 is 9.
-Hold on.

33:37.764 --> 33:40.569
9. Yep.
Good work.

33:41.234 --> 33:44.171
A group of 9 is called an
ennead.

33:45.106 --> 33:48.175
Multiple enneads is
called Erineys.

33:48.876 --> 33:52.711
Which is a Greek term for--
-Furies.

33:52.713 --> 33:54.646
Exactly.

33:54.648 --> 33:56.981
We live in a
mathematical universe.

33:56.983 --> 34:05.024
Somehow the time of 3:33
unlocks a dimension between
our world and theirs.

34:05.026 --> 34:07.329
Is that central or
mountain time?

34:09.763 --> 34:14.197
I just can't figure out why they
can't stay in our world?

34:14.199 --> 34:17.703
What keeps sending them
back each time?

34:17.705 --> 34:20.973
Maybe they have part-time
jobs as telemarketers.

34:20.975 --> 34:23.775
That would explain why they're
so pissed off all the time.
-Sinbad, come on.

34:23.777 --> 34:26.844
Be serious. I'm trying to
save your life here.

34:26.847 --> 34:28.813
And my life. Nick's life.

34:28.815 --> 34:31.216
I appreciate it.
I really do.
-I'm scared

34:31.217 --> 34:35.219
that your sword isn't gonna
save you this time.
-I'm not.

34:35.222 --> 34:40.292
This isn't paranoid or
delusional.
-Oh my gosh.

34:40.293 --> 34:44.929
What is it gonna take to
convince you that these women
maybe supernatural?

34:44.931 --> 34:47.466
- Sinbad?

34:47.467 --> 34:50.703
SINBAD! SINBAD!
Oh my God!
Sinbad!

34:57.278 --> 34:59.011
Ooh!
-It finally happened.

34:59.013 --> 35:00.745
David Duchovny turned me
into a dolphin.

35:00.747 --> 35:04.816
It's Dionysus, you idiot!
And quit making fun of me!

35:04.818 --> 35:06.887
I'm okay.
Thanks for asking.

35:07.088 --> 35:09.421
How you ever been with
a Merman, girl?

35:09.423 --> 35:12.323
You want to go to Atlantis?
Right under the sea.

35:12.325 --> 35:15.194
Are we gonna
celebrate this ship's
inaugural trip or what?

35:15.196 --> 35:19.367
And may I point out how long
this trip is since some of us
can't fly?

35:32.113 --> 35:33.682
Sinbad.

35:34.180 --> 35:37.017
What kinda of adventure do
you got me going on?

35:38.252 --> 35:39.517
Your last one.

35:39.519 --> 35:41.419
Before you settle down and
become and old man.

35:41.421 --> 35:44.189
- And you will get back to
Mexico,

35:44.191 --> 35:45.991
give Daphne a proper proposal,

35:45.993 --> 35:48.797
and become and old man.
I promise.

35:51.899 --> 35:54.202
That ain't for you.

35:58.839 --> 36:01.009
Nick wasn't kidding.

36:01.776 --> 36:04.011
He really does love that girl.

36:07.113 --> 36:09.316
Do you want to get married?

36:12.419 --> 36:14.019
Are you proposing?

36:14.021 --> 36:15.354
No.

36:15.356 --> 36:18.890
Eww. I'm asking in general.

36:18.892 --> 36:20.558
It's not really my style.

36:20.560 --> 36:24.296
Yeah. I didn't think I
liked tradition either.

36:24.298 --> 36:26.899
I think I'm staring to
change my mind.

36:26.901 --> 36:29.169
About a lot of thing actually.

36:31.972 --> 36:34.843
Like the Furies.

36:35.109 --> 36:39.211
Even though they scare me, I
feel strangely comforted by

36:39.213 --> 36:41.913
the fact that magic and
myth could be real.

36:41.915 --> 36:43.482
Why?

36:43.484 --> 36:45.920
The Ancient World was a
madhouse.

36:46.486 --> 36:51.256
And you prefer that over
the mindless chaos of the
modern world?

36:51.258 --> 36:55.928
I mean, at least back then, you
could appease a god by making a
sacrifice to it.

36:55.930 --> 36:59.533
Sinbad! Come
join the party!

37:01.502 --> 37:05.136
It would be rude to not go up
and have a couple brewskis.

37:05.138 --> 37:06.571
Cheers.
"Party on!"

37:06.573 --> 37:08.876
"Excellent!"

37:19.252 --> 37:21.388
Maybe they overslept.

37:23.089 --> 37:25.122
Did you get any sleep at all?

37:25.124 --> 37:26.493
Nope.

37:27.461 --> 37:28.326
Man.

37:28.328 --> 37:31.098
I thought for sure I'd
figured it out.

37:32.365 --> 37:35.433
Maybe they can't
manifest in water?

37:35.435 --> 37:39.203
And can only crawl out of the
earth from where their blood was
first spilt?

37:39.205 --> 37:41.105
So you do believe!

37:41.107 --> 37:43.211
No. But you do.
It's cute.

37:44.611 --> 37:47.011
I'm sorry they're just
regular assassins.

37:47.013 --> 37:49.214
I'm so embarrassed.

37:49.216 --> 37:54.051
Don't be. I used to stay up all
night waiting for Santa
Claus to show up. So what?

37:54.053 --> 37:58.522
You stayed up all night
waiting for the brides of Satan
to show up.

37:58.524 --> 38:02.560
It is a little weird. I guess,
I can see how you'd be a
little embarrassed.

38:02.562 --> 38:05.098
Why are you up so early?

38:05.999 --> 38:08.033
We're half hour from port.

38:08.035 --> 38:09.937
Oh really?

38:13.640 --> 38:15.108
Thirty minutes.

38:16.410 --> 38:18.011
That was fast.

38:24.618 --> 38:27.021
Hey, can I see those
binoculars?

38:31.425 --> 38:33.294
Thanks.

38:36.263 --> 38:38.132
I gotta go help up top.

38:38.464 --> 38:40.131
Go pack up your books.

38:40.133 --> 38:42.569
I want to be ready to rock
as soon as we dock.

38:44.537 --> 38:47.171
Wait. Wait, do you see
that over there?

38:47.173 --> 38:49.109
On that cliff.

38:49.943 --> 38:52.146
- Where?
- Here.

39:00.553 --> 39:02.356
Trees?

39:03.457 --> 39:05.093
Go back up.

39:15.435 --> 39:16.937
Everybody up!

39:17.171 --> 39:18.673
Approaching land!

39:26.580 --> 39:28.513
I never thought I'd
be back here.

39:28.515 --> 39:31.015
What? The United States
or with Jax?

39:31.017 --> 39:33.417
Hey! We're not like official.

39:43.430 --> 39:45.529
Keep it straight!
I can't control it.

39:45.531 --> 39:47.765
Keep it straight!
I'm getting pulled
towards the rocks!

39:47.767 --> 39:50.070
I'm going to go
shut off the engine.
- Alright.

39:52.573 --> 39:53.772
Hurry!

39:53.774 --> 39:57.508
We're in trouble!
Sebastian,
grab the wheel!

39:57.510 --> 39:59.279
Mikey! Eyes up top!

40:02.015 --> 40:04.218
Special K is out of
the plates.

40:04.752 --> 40:08.022
- It's the Furies!
- Not now Jax!

40:25.705 --> 40:27.471
Ah! Stop! Stop!

40:27.473 --> 40:29.573
Stop! Please!

40:43.189 --> 40:44.992
Help! Sebastian!

40:45.258 --> 40:46.625
Sebastian!

40:46.627 --> 40:49.294
Sebastian! Help me
hold him down!

40:49.296 --> 40:50.665
Sebastian!

40:59.807 --> 41:01.509
Are you okay?

41:01.707 --> 41:05.810
Okay. Help the other crew!
Hurry!

41:05.812 --> 41:07.479
Hurry!

41:07.481 --> 41:08.716
What happened?

41:12.519 --> 41:14.319
Furies! Come on!

41:14.321 --> 41:15.423
Hurry!

41:22.528 --> 41:23.861
You want him?

41:23.863 --> 41:25.330
Nick!

41:25.332 --> 41:27.799
Come and get him!

41:29.303 --> 41:31.439
No!

41:44.584 --> 41:46.618
Finally Arabian.

41:46.620 --> 41:51.059
Your payment for my
vengeance is long overdue.

41:57.263 --> 41:58.466
Nick!

42:02.169 --> 42:03.703
Nick!

42:08.175 --> 42:09.810
Nick!

42:26.260 --> 42:29.497
Looking for Ace Adar.
You heard of him?

42:29.897 --> 42:31.866
He wasn't very nice.

42:32.598 --> 42:34.769
Let's try that guy.

42:38.437 --> 42:39.773
Hello.

42:41.675 --> 42:43.841
Oh, no thanks.

42:43.843 --> 42:47.180
Don't look now but that guy
back there has been following us
for a while now.

42:50.883 --> 42:53.919
You're about as subtle
as a drunken goat in a
convalescent home.

42:53.921 --> 42:57.859
No thank you.
It's pretty.

42:59.426 --> 43:02.563
Come on. Let's go around.
Gotta find this Ace guy.

43:04.330 --> 43:07.299
That's too expensive.
Thank you though.

43:07.301 --> 43:08.700
Not to worry, Dr. Kree.

43:08.702 --> 43:12.370
- Compliments of Manta Marquis.

43:34.694 --> 43:36.261
Let's get out of here!

43:36.263 --> 43:37.995
Stop! Thief! Thief!

43:42.935 --> 43:44.368
In there!

44:01.687 --> 44:03.020
All clear.

44:03.022 --> 44:05.290
What about these?

44:05.292 --> 44:06.957
You're not gonna like this.

44:10.631 --> 44:12.529
I must be crazy.

44:12.531 --> 44:15.767
You...
-Oh my God.
- are welcome.

44:15.769 --> 44:17.671
Thank you.

44:21.508 --> 44:23.211
Mr. Siridad!

44:23.977 --> 44:24.942
Who are you?

44:24.944 --> 44:26.977
I want to help you.

44:26.979 --> 44:28.946
Why have you been
following us all day?

44:28.948 --> 44:30.814
I wasn't sure if it was you.

44:30.816 --> 44:32.049
You an assassin, too?

44:32.051 --> 44:34.319
I'm your driver.

44:34.321 --> 44:37.888
Ace Adar sent me.
He wanted you to
arrive in style.

44:37.890 --> 44:40.325
Welcome to Los Angeles.

44:40.327 --> 44:42.597
Come. This way.

44:51.338 --> 44:54.471
Mr. Siridad, we have arrived.

44:54.473 --> 44:57.808
Sinbad!

44:57.810 --> 44:59.814
Welcome!
-Hey you!

45:00.414 --> 45:01.549
Oh!

45:02.615 --> 45:04.616
How fragrant you are.

45:04.618 --> 45:07.355
You didn't pick up your phone.

45:08.655 --> 45:10.754
I lost the damn thing again.

45:10.756 --> 45:14.426
Me and modern day
don't mingle well.

45:14.428 --> 45:16.931
Ace, I'd like you to meet--
-Shh!

45:18.865 --> 45:19.966
Ooh.

45:22.068 --> 45:23.968
Let me guess your name.

45:23.970 --> 45:26.937
Okay. Mm-hmm.
-Please come closer.

45:26.939 --> 45:28.807
I want to read your palm.

45:28.809 --> 45:30.310
Sure.

45:32.546 --> 45:33.944
Hmm.

45:35.749 --> 45:38.582
Somebody's been a naughty girl.

45:38.584 --> 45:40.521
Intelligent.

45:41.021 --> 45:44.689
Yet naive in some matters.

45:44.691 --> 45:45.924
Excuse me?

45:45.926 --> 45:49.127
It's okay. I'm a raving idiot
about mechanics,

45:49.129 --> 45:52.066
but I know every
constellation by heart.

45:55.401 --> 45:57.067
Hmm.

45:57.069 --> 46:01.071
You have a secret dream.
You're scared to tell the
other about.

46:01.073 --> 46:03.040
Don't me all?

46:03.042 --> 46:06.678
Now, as enchanting as this is,
we really do have to--

46:06.680 --> 46:08.145
Ah. Ah.

46:08.147 --> 46:09.781
Here it is.

46:09.783 --> 46:13.151
You have your aunt's name.

46:13.153 --> 46:14.685
Jacqueline.

46:14.687 --> 46:15.654
Boom!

46:15.656 --> 46:18.522
Oh my God!
That's incredible.

46:18.524 --> 46:20.125
Try him next.

46:20.127 --> 46:24.529
Oh no, no, no, no. Sorry.
My skills only work on women.

46:24.531 --> 46:26.564
Please, come inside.

46:26.566 --> 46:28.336
Come inside.

46:33.406 --> 46:34.638
Thank you.

46:34.640 --> 46:35.906
Thanks.

46:35.908 --> 46:38.611
Thanks.
-Thanks.

46:40.714 --> 46:42.817
Come.

46:46.852 --> 46:48.520
Ah.

46:48.522 --> 46:50.020
Come in my friends.

46:50.022 --> 46:52.093
Welcome to my home.

46:57.430 --> 46:59.663
The Babylonaica?

46:59.665 --> 47:04.502
But these volumes were lost
when the Library of Alexandria
burned down, right?

47:04.504 --> 47:05.870
You have a good eye.

47:05.872 --> 47:07.772
Actually, those are only
reproductions.

47:07.774 --> 47:09.540
The originals are stored
safely in my vaults.

47:09.542 --> 47:15.647
But don't tell. Every armchair
archeologist with a blog will be
flying in to check it out.

47:15.649 --> 47:17.752
Please. Come and sit down.

47:18.118 --> 47:19.854
Oh my gosh.

47:20.720 --> 47:22.120
Do you still have the
Heart of Medusa?

47:22.122 --> 47:26.957
Of course. Along with the liver
of Prometheus, the loins of
Adonis--

47:26.959 --> 47:29.028
Keep your loins to yourself.

47:29.830 --> 47:32.796
Manta knows we're in
Los Angeles.

47:32.798 --> 47:35.232
His men attached us by
your shop.

47:35.234 --> 47:38.838
Ooh. That's awfully
bold of him.

47:39.071 --> 47:40.805
Like the other artifacts
he recovered,

47:40.807 --> 47:44.611
he must believe the heart can
be used as a weapon as well.

47:45.211 --> 47:47.779
Is this stone a weapon?

47:47.781 --> 47:50.214
Hard to say.

47:50.216 --> 47:54.919
Anything can be mutated into a
device of destruction.

47:54.921 --> 47:58.656
Just look at what we've done
with the atoms in the air.

47:58.658 --> 48:02.897
Three women are also after us.

48:03.263 --> 48:08.131
Jax believes they're the Furies.

48:08.133 --> 48:10.935
I know they're the Furies.

48:10.937 --> 48:12.106
Wait.

48:13.372 --> 48:17.140
You're on the hit list for both
the Russians and the Greek gods?

48:17.142 --> 48:18.877
Popular boy.

48:18.879 --> 48:21.946
Give me the heart and
let's all get out of here.

48:21.948 --> 48:24.249
And who's going to
reimburse me?

48:24.251 --> 48:27.084
Where would you take us that's
safer than here?

48:27.086 --> 48:30.921
Not every problem can be solved
by running away, Sinbad.

48:30.923 --> 48:33.924
Fine.
What's your solution?

48:33.926 --> 48:36.796
What do you think we
should do with the heart?

48:37.664 --> 48:39.330
Destroy it.

48:39.332 --> 48:44.903
If the stone no longer exists,
there's nothing for Manta or
these Furies to take.

48:44.905 --> 48:47.906
No. That stone is an
invaluable artifact.

48:47.908 --> 48:51.975
To be studied and learned from.
Not to be destroyed.

48:51.977 --> 48:56.281
My past experience ditching the
evidence only pisses of the
people you owe even more.

48:56.283 --> 49:00.688
Ace, what is the deal
with this stone?

49:02.589 --> 49:08.993
I'm not sure but I believe there
is someone that can tell us what
we're dealing with.

49:08.995 --> 49:10.564
But...

49:11.897 --> 49:14.299
But you rather give
me a migraine while I
try to figure out

49:14.301 --> 49:16.636
what you're thinking
outside your head?

49:17.269 --> 49:21.705
The heart isn't the only
treasure I own with
mystical appeal.

49:21.707 --> 49:26.243
You have a skill with these
artifacts. I would like to
take advantage of.

49:26.245 --> 49:28.779
If you want me to do magic
tricks, there's a two
drink minimum.

49:30.783 --> 49:31.885
But first,

49:32.285 --> 49:35.587
you need to take a
bath and change.

49:35.589 --> 49:37.725
To look at some artifacts?

49:38.258 --> 49:41.225
Let's just say it's best to make
a good impression on her.

49:41.227 --> 49:42.727
"Her?"

49:42.729 --> 49:43.631
"Her."

49:45.332 --> 49:46.598
"Her?"

49:46.600 --> 49:48.366
No. "Her."

49:48.368 --> 49:53.037
Okay. Alright you guy.
Well I think a shower
sounds wonderful.

49:53.039 --> 49:56.975
But unfortunately, We
don't have ant clothes that
we can change into.

49:56.977 --> 50:00.044
Not to worry. I have ample
wardrobe selection for you both.

50:00.046 --> 50:06.084
I hope you don't mind a more
traditional style.

50:10.689 --> 50:12.857
Show our guests to their rooms.

50:12.859 --> 50:16.263
And lay out the clothes
I prepared.

50:19.098 --> 50:22.866
We are running for our lives and
you're planning a dinner party?

50:22.868 --> 50:25.002
Who's supposed to jump in and
save the day, Martha Stewart?

50:25.004 --> 50:28.740
Oh, she' much better
than Martha.

50:28.742 --> 50:32.979
Who is this lady you want
me to impress?

50:36.682 --> 50:39.017
I've never met her myself,

50:39.019 --> 50:42.089
But I believe you can
draw her out.

50:42.756 --> 50:44.591
Come my friends.
Go.

51:02.776 --> 51:05.442
So where's Sinbad?

51:05.444 --> 51:08.115
This is going to make
and impression.

51:12.285 --> 51:14.451
Was he an Arabian
Chippendale?

51:14.453 --> 51:16.723
Very nice.

51:20.026 --> 51:22.426
I just can't do the turban.

51:22.428 --> 51:25.062
Not to worry. I wouldn't
wear it either.

51:25.064 --> 51:27.865
But you look
magnificent.

51:27.867 --> 51:30.903
A spitting image if I may
say so myself.

51:31.370 --> 51:34.971
You know, we may
just fool her.

51:34.973 --> 51:37.475
Who else is
here besides us?

51:37.477 --> 51:39.076
Ace, instead of
playing dress up,

51:39.078 --> 51:40.645
we should be figuring
what this stone can do

51:40.647 --> 51:45.015
and how to stop Manta and those
women from getting it.
-Mmhm. Yeah. Yeah. Sure.

51:45.017 --> 51:47.021
Does it feel heavy?

51:48.988 --> 51:54.491
Yeah.  I should feel overly
exposed, odd weight to it.
-Like,

51:54.493 --> 51:56.259
aura of armor, yes?

51:56.261 --> 51:58.095
Where did you get this?

51:58.097 --> 52:00.330
The desert's too hot for
heavy armor,

52:00.332 --> 52:03.366
so old Sindibad had it woven
from the silk of the Calypso

52:03.368 --> 52:06.169
Spider to give him an
advantage in war.

52:06.171 --> 52:09.075
I want to live
here forever.

52:10.910 --> 52:12.743
I love this!

52:12.745 --> 52:16.180
Sinbad, isn't this
awesome?

52:16.182 --> 52:18.352
Fits me perfectly.

52:19.385 --> 52:25.122
Yeah. It is perfect. For a five
year old birthday party.

52:25.124 --> 52:30.093
Guys, enough games.
Ace, where's the heart?

52:30.095 --> 52:33.798
Upstairs. That's the best place
for us to try this.

52:33.800 --> 52:36.968
Just in case things get
a little boisterous.

52:36.970 --> 52:40.504
You know, if the Furies
do come tonight,

52:40.506 --> 52:43.941
and it's safe to
assume they will,

52:43.943 --> 52:47.046
we're going to need a magical
bodyguard ourselves.

52:48.046 --> 52:49.782
Please, come on.
Yes.

52:50.383 --> 52:52.218
This way.

53:03.028 --> 53:04.361
Jax?

53:04.363 --> 53:08.265
Oh, I'm good I'll stay here.
I found some reading.
-You sure?

53:08.267 --> 53:10.269
Yeah.
-Okay.

53:19.245 --> 53:21.511
How do these furies
keep finding me?

53:21.513 --> 53:23.881
And if they're so magically
powerful and all-knowing,

53:23.883 --> 53:25.486
why don't they know you
have the heart?

53:27.086 --> 53:29.520
Maybe it's not all
they want.

53:29.522 --> 53:31.855
What aren't you telling me?

53:31.857 --> 53:36.028
I wonder if the Furies
really want the Heart of
the Medusa back.

53:36.428 --> 53:42.101
I'm beginning to believe that
they could be after you instead.

53:53.847 --> 53:55.245
Watch your step.

53:58.151 --> 53:59.850
Oh! Oof!

53:59.852 --> 54:01.084
Is this where you keep
the dead bodies?

54:01.086 --> 54:04.055
I know.
It's the heart.

54:04.057 --> 54:04.955
Where is it?

54:04.957 --> 54:06.926
In that basket.

54:07.993 --> 54:09.961
I tried covering it up
to contain the smell,

54:09.963 --> 54:12.499
but it just gets
stronger.

54:12.999 --> 54:14.365
Ah!

54:14.367 --> 54:18.472
Sorry. That's
Cleopatra's asp.

54:18.972 --> 54:20.904
What a great ass she had.

54:20.906 --> 54:23.406
Some say it's Cesar.

54:23.408 --> 54:25.942
Dude. get a new hobby.

54:25.944 --> 54:27.914
Try the other.

54:33.318 --> 54:35.118
Careful.

54:35.120 --> 54:41.327
There's definitely a chemical
breakdown in that jewel like
nothing I've encountered before.

54:44.530 --> 54:45.997
Wha is all this stuff?

54:45.999 --> 54:48.234
Ah. This...

54:49.202 --> 54:52.069
is my more
eclectic treasures.

54:52.071 --> 54:54.205
Aladdin's carpets.

54:54.207 --> 54:57.377
Here, the tears of Allah.

54:57.577 --> 55:01.848
This is a perfect atmosphere
for us to try using this.

55:04.984 --> 55:07.221
It never worked for me.

55:07.620 --> 55:11.091
Not even as a traditional lamp.

55:11.624 --> 55:17.294
But perhaps if a descendant
of the original Old
Sindibad lights it,

55:17.296 --> 55:21.133
maybe it will bring her our
of her slumber.

55:22.100 --> 55:23.600
Okay. Come on.

55:23.602 --> 55:25.435
What do you have to lose?

55:25.437 --> 55:27.273
Try it.

55:30.709 --> 55:33.379
I've tried all kinds of oils.

55:37.316 --> 55:41.718
It's not a lamp.
It's a puzzle box.
-Really?

55:41.720 --> 55:43.923
How do we open it?

55:44.189 --> 55:45.392
Simple.

55:46.124 --> 55:48.125
Solve the riddle.

55:48.127 --> 55:49.961
My lord.

55:49.963 --> 55:52.430
I had no idea it had
such a shine.

55:52.432 --> 55:55.102
It's like brand new.

56:17.457 --> 56:18.957
What's it saying?

56:18.959 --> 56:29.265
It's some kind of Ancient
Genie dialect. I'm a bit rusty
but let me try.

56:42.015 --> 56:46.250
She said she can manifest
reality three times

56:46.252 --> 56:49.990
if you're too lazy to do it
yourself. Oh! She's witty.

56:50.289 --> 56:55.328
Manifest reality, like...
Anything?

57:03.635 --> 57:07.537
She said, you can limit
yourself if you like.

57:07.539 --> 57:09.308
Millions do it everyday.

57:10.243 --> 57:12.109
Ask her what the Heart of
Medusa is and why Manta

57:12.111 --> 57:15.015
and those rejects from
Lita Ford School of Rock
want it so bad.

57:15.781 --> 57:17.283
That's a mouth full.

57:17.517 --> 57:19.586
Let me try.

57:31.164 --> 57:36.700
She's getting angry. She said
she can't read minds and the
stone can't do anything,

57:36.702 --> 57:39.736
It's just matter
without consciousness.

57:39.738 --> 57:42.242
But you just said she could.

57:42.575 --> 57:43.774
Let me try.

57:51.350 --> 57:52.716
She's getting really mad.

57:52.718 --> 57:57.257
She says, "Make a wish.
Any wish. Get a life!"

57:58.457 --> 58:01.494
Bring my friend Nick
back to life.

58:13.772 --> 58:16.209
You said you can do anything.

58:21.580 --> 58:25.281
She can turn time forward, but
she can't turn time back.

58:25.283 --> 58:29.289
Okay. What else
can't you do?

58:39.731 --> 58:42.765
She won't intentionally harm
anyone and she won't give you
money.

58:42.767 --> 58:46.539
That would involve taking it
away from someone.

58:47.439 --> 58:49.809
So you can't kill the Furies?

58:51.843 --> 58:55.513
I am a Genie, not a machine gun.

58:55.515 --> 58:58.182
Wait a minute, you
speak english now?

58:58.184 --> 59:01.285
What is this? Some weird
elaborate hoax?

59:01.287 --> 59:03.220
I had no idea.

59:03.222 --> 59:04.921
I don't have time
for this.

59:04.923 --> 59:09.660
You are different than
the other Sinbad.

59:09.662 --> 59:12.462
You have an air of arrogance.

59:12.464 --> 59:15.432
And yet you are actually humble.

59:15.434 --> 59:19.904
A valiant hero trying
to be a thief.

59:23.776 --> 59:31.247
You're wishes don't work because
you're actually pretending to be
something else.

59:31.249 --> 59:32.348
A rogue.

59:38.723 --> 59:40.723
If you think I'm a joke,
say it to my face.

59:40.725 --> 59:43.961
I don't need some industrial
Light and Magic rip-off
making fun of me.

59:43.963 --> 59:47.300
I came here for one reason.
To get the stone. Now that I
have it--

59:48.600 --> 59:51.502
Hey! That's got the snake in it.

59:51.504 --> 59:54.939
Which you should get rid of
because it's illegal to keep
exotic pets in California.

59:54.941 --> 59:58.341
Look at the thief
peaching the law.

59:58.343 --> 01:00:02.546
The Jinn was right. Deep down,
you are a hero at heart.

01:00:02.548 --> 01:00:05.718
Sebastian, we're
out of here.

01:00:06.419 --> 01:00:08.622
Sinbad, wait.

01:00:10.323 --> 01:00:12.723
Get your stuff.
We're out of here.

01:00:12.725 --> 01:00:14.924
This guy has done nothing but
waste our time and play games.

01:00:14.926 --> 01:00:18.696
Sinbad, I'm sorry.
I never meant to offend you.

01:00:18.698 --> 01:00:20.930
Offended I can handle.
But lied to?

01:00:20.932 --> 01:00:22.566
I never miss let you.

01:00:22.568 --> 01:00:27.571
And you told me you were
going to share the magical
mysteries of my family.

01:00:27.573 --> 01:00:29.772
And I have!

01:00:29.774 --> 01:00:32.609
If my heritage involves playing
footsie with some second-rate

01:00:32.611 --> 01:00:37.747
Barbara Eden wanna-be you keep
locked up on the attic, I pray
to God I'm adopted.

01:00:37.749 --> 01:00:43.354
Young man, that lamp hasn't
worked for anyone for
hundreds of years.

01:00:43.356 --> 01:00:46.857
Who knows what you're
capable of if you just embraced
your legacy!

01:00:46.859 --> 01:00:48.825
I don't care about my heritage.

01:00:48.827 --> 01:00:55.332
I don't want the lamp. I
don't want the heart. I wish
I'd never even found it.

01:00:55.334 --> 01:00:57.734
I'd rethink that if I were you.

01:00:57.736 --> 01:01:01.705
Why? What's so special about it?

01:01:01.707 --> 01:01:07.511
Well it says here that the Heart
of Medusa has the power of
twenty gods.

01:01:07.513 --> 01:01:08.979
Big deal.

01:01:08.981 --> 01:01:12.049
And it can transform the
shape of continents.

01:01:12.051 --> 01:01:15.319
Oh yeah? I think Global Warming
has dibs on that one.

01:01:15.321 --> 01:01:20.290
Okay. Well I think with
these ancient texts backing
up these claims,

01:01:20.292 --> 01:01:26.964
that gem it could easily
be worth over one hundred
million dollars.

01:01:26.966 --> 01:01:29.533
I will fight to the death
to keep that stone away

01:01:29.535 --> 01:01:33.837
from anyone who tries to take
it or wishes us harm.

01:01:33.839 --> 01:01:35.973
How do you know that anyway?

01:01:35.975 --> 01:01:37.978
Easy.

01:01:39.345 --> 01:01:41.779
I found the instruction manual.

01:01:41.781 --> 01:01:44.317
I forgot I owned that book.

01:01:45.584 --> 01:01:49.486
These texts are endless
allegories about the
Heart of Medusa

01:01:49.488 --> 01:01:54.524
is a warning that revenge and
anger just trap a person

01:01:54.526 --> 01:01:59.598
in some kind of prison of rage
so that they can't move on with
their life.

01:02:00.031 --> 01:02:03.767
Sound like wise words to me.

01:02:03.769 --> 01:02:07.004
Cardinal, bring another
bottle of wine.

01:02:07.006 --> 01:02:13.743
The Domaine Jean-Louise Rhone
2005.

01:02:13.745 --> 01:02:18.381
Not the 2003?
You common Peasant!

01:02:18.383 --> 01:02:20.683
Oh, I'm impressed.

01:02:20.685 --> 01:02:24.988
Fetch the good vintage. I must
live up to Sinbad's standards.

01:02:24.990 --> 01:02:28.591
You seem pretty calm on the
eve of Armageddon.

01:02:28.593 --> 01:02:34.997
Well, I learned long ago to let
fate have her way with me.

01:02:34.999 --> 01:02:38.669
All I can control is whether
I face her sober.

01:02:41.106 --> 01:02:43.075
This is useless.

01:02:44.377 --> 01:02:47.714
Ah. Let me see your finds.

01:02:50.548 --> 01:02:53.919
I'm not even sure if the Heart
of Medusa is a weapon anymore.

01:02:55.053 --> 01:02:57.723
Then we stick with what
we know works.

01:02:58.723 --> 01:03:00.059
Yeah.

01:03:00.526 --> 01:03:04.731
I picked these up at the
market yesterday.

01:03:05.930 --> 01:03:07.865
These work.

01:03:07.867 --> 01:03:09.602
I highly recommend them.

01:03:09.834 --> 01:03:12.169
Instead of striking back
at the Furies,

01:03:12.171 --> 01:03:17.006
perhaps there's another way to
quell their anger towards you.

01:03:17.008 --> 01:03:19.542
Why do they hate me so much?

01:03:19.544 --> 01:03:23.846
What's this grievance they
have against me?

01:03:23.848 --> 01:03:29.185
Hmm. The "useless" wisdom our
dear doctor discarded

01:03:29.187 --> 01:03:32.790
is actually the instructions
we're looking for.

01:03:32.792 --> 01:03:34.558
Here it is.

01:03:34.560 --> 01:03:39.696
You ancestor, Old Sindibad,
sailed seven voyages.

01:03:39.698 --> 01:03:42.899
Most with passion
and glory,

01:03:42.901 --> 01:03:52.109
but it says here his fourth
voyage, i'm sad to say,
brought out the worst in him.

01:03:52.111 --> 01:03:56.580
<i>He shipwrecked on an
 island and married the
 kingdom's princess.</i>

01:03:56.582 --> 01:04:00.817
<i> Not long after the wedding,
 she fell ill and died.</i>

01:04:00.819 --> 01:04:04.888
<i> It was then he learned the
 land's dastardly custom.</i>

01:04:04.890 --> 01:04:09.493
<i> If one spouse died, the
 living spouse was buried
 alive with them.</i>

01:04:09.495 --> 01:04:12.796
You know what, they use to
do that in India.

01:04:12.798 --> 01:04:16.232
Except it was only the wives
that had to be buried alive with
their dead husbands.

01:04:16.234 --> 01:04:18.637
No the other way around.

01:04:18.937 --> 01:04:22.205
Which is sexist.

01:04:22.207 --> 01:04:23.841
Why did you look at me when
you said that?

01:04:23.843 --> 01:04:30.881
<i>Sinbad was thrown into the
communal tomb with just a little
 bit of water</i>

01:04:30.883 --> 01:04:32.783
<i> and a small loaf of bread.</i>

01:04:32.785 --> 01:04:38.087
<i>Weeks passed. Just when he
 was about to die, the tomb
 opened and another couple-</i>

01:04:38.089 --> 01:04:41.658
<i> this time the husband dead,
 but the wife was alive.</i>

01:04:41.660 --> 01:04:43.861
<i>She was thrown into the cavern.</i>

01:04:46.664 --> 01:04:48.866
<i>Only thinking about
 himself, Sindibad killed</i>

01:04:48.868 --> 01:04:52.839
<i> the woman and took her
 rations to stay alive.</i>

01:04:58.209 --> 01:05:04.149
<i> He did this two more times
 with two other women
 thrown into the tomb.</i>

01:05:11.990 --> 01:05:16.225
<i>Eventually he had enough
 rations to regain his
 strength and escape.</i>

01:05:16.227 --> 01:05:20.564
Those three women he killed

01:05:20.566 --> 01:05:22.698
became the Furies.

01:05:22.700 --> 01:05:25.701
The stone he used to beat
them dead was the actual

01:05:25.703 --> 01:05:29.105
hardened heart of
the slain Medusa,

01:05:29.107 --> 01:05:30.941
discarded in the cave,

01:05:30.943 --> 01:05:33.810
but given new life  by the anger
of the three murdered women.

01:05:35.013 --> 01:05:38.781
Resurrected by mad magic
as the Furies,

01:05:38.783 --> 01:05:42.319
they swore to one day use the
stone to punish all men

01:05:42.321 --> 01:05:45.055
for Old Sindibad for Old
Sindibad's crimes.

01:05:45.057 --> 01:05:49.792
The stone keeps them
confined to this earth in an
infinite cycle.

01:05:49.794 --> 01:05:55.265
As long as their rage is
eternal, their lifeline will
have no end.

01:05:55.267 --> 01:05:57.700
So is the stone a life
force for them?

01:05:57.702 --> 01:06:00.604
Would explain the desire
and need for it.

01:06:00.606 --> 01:06:02.876
And why they never stay dead.

01:06:04.008 --> 01:06:06.075
Each night they're born anew.

01:06:06.077 --> 01:06:11.348
Old Sindibad's eighth voyage was
meant to be one of redemption.

01:06:11.350 --> 01:06:14.554
To use his wrath to
break their rage.

01:06:15.955 --> 01:06:18.290
He died before completing it.

01:06:18.691 --> 01:06:21.725
But perhaps that for you to do.

01:06:23.062 --> 01:06:24.928
Cardinal?

01:06:24.930 --> 01:06:26.899
Ace, wait.

01:06:31.636 --> 01:06:33.937
Get back pretty boy.

01:06:33.939 --> 01:06:36.676
Get your hand off the
butter knife.

01:06:37.075 --> 01:06:39.709
Hello, treasure hunter.

01:06:39.711 --> 01:06:42.247
I'd like my property back, hmm?

01:06:43.982 --> 01:06:47.618
Where is the Heart of Medusa?

01:06:47.620 --> 01:06:50.087
How dare you enter my home!

01:06:50.089 --> 01:06:53.122
You are a terrible host.

01:06:53.124 --> 01:06:57.093
We came all this way
just to see you.

01:06:57.095 --> 01:07:01.832
Cy, find the stone. I want to
test my theory of it.

01:07:01.834 --> 01:07:04.200
Right here.
Right now.

01:07:04.202 --> 01:07:05.868
Oh yeah, you got a
theory?

01:07:05.870 --> 01:07:07.870
What "theory" is that?

01:07:07.872 --> 01:07:15.379
Unlike you, this stone has
untapped potential.

01:07:15.381 --> 01:07:17.080
Cy, find the stone.

01:07:17.082 --> 01:07:21.321
Where is the stone?

01:07:22.421 --> 01:07:24.057
Sebastian,

01:07:24.722 --> 01:07:25.988
tell him where he can find it.

01:07:25.990 --> 01:07:28.360
Yes, Sebastian.

01:07:35.066 --> 01:07:36.368
Really?

01:07:42.740 --> 01:07:44.209
Drop it!

01:07:46.446 --> 01:07:48.879
Hey, hey! Stab her
neck.

01:07:48.881 --> 01:07:51.415
I will filet your neck
right now if you don't
tell him to let her go.

01:07:51.417 --> 01:07:53.816
Oh you won't
dare, Big boy.

01:07:53.818 --> 01:07:56.053
Snap her neck,
Let her go!

01:07:56.055 --> 01:07:59.022
Let her go!
-He's going to snap her neck.
It's easy. She's going to die.

01:07:59.024 --> 01:08:02.024
Don't snap her neck. Tell
him not to snap her neck.

01:08:02.026 --> 01:08:03.959
Let go of me first and
I'll let her live.

01:08:03.961 --> 01:08:08.230
Oh? Hmm? Then you'll get a
little on the side? Huh?

01:08:08.232 --> 01:08:09.265
Huh?

01:08:09.267 --> 01:08:10.767
Eh?

01:08:10.769 --> 01:08:12.939
Alright.
-You like that?

01:08:13.972 --> 01:08:15.337
Yeah,

01:08:15.339 --> 01:08:16.841
Wow.

01:08:27.218 --> 01:08:28.287
Wow.

01:08:29.720 --> 01:08:32.488
You. Little rich man.

01:08:32.490 --> 01:08:38.361
You're going to tell me where
the Heart of Medusa is?

01:08:38.363 --> 01:08:43.403
Because you know and I don't.
I want to find it so badly. Hmm?

01:08:47.404 --> 01:08:49.005
Right on time.

01:08:49.006 --> 01:08:50.273
Who's that?

01:08:50.274 --> 01:08:52.908
Sure as hell ain't the
Avon lady.

01:08:52.910 --> 01:08:54.944
We better get the hell
out of here.
-No. No.

01:08:54.946 --> 01:08:57.279
We don't have to
do anything. Hmm?

01:08:57.281 --> 01:08:59.283
Cy, go check the door.

01:09:03.455 --> 01:09:08.825
Fine, you stay here watch them.
me and my new friend will go
check the door, okay?

01:09:08.827 --> 01:09:10.127
Manta.

01:09:11.363 --> 01:09:13.162
I would listen to Sinbad.

01:09:13.163 --> 01:09:16.398
Cy, you're my bodyguard.

01:09:16.399 --> 01:09:18.934
I pay you to guard my body.
You're going to go first.

01:09:18.935 --> 01:09:20.836
Then we're going to
come in after you.

01:09:20.837 --> 01:09:23.473
And you, my man,
you're doing great.

01:09:23.475 --> 01:09:27.846
You keep your gun on them.
If he sneezes you shoot him in
the kneecap, okay?

01:09:29.113 --> 01:09:31.982
What are you doing? Go.
-He punched me in the throat.

01:09:31.984 --> 01:09:35.087
I will punch you in the
clavicle. Go! Now!

01:09:41.126 --> 01:09:43.296
Promotions for you.

01:09:51.069 --> 01:09:53.002
Who wants to play?

01:09:53.004 --> 01:09:55.538
Did you order strippers?
What's wrong with you?

01:09:55.540 --> 01:09:56.540
Hand over.

01:09:56.542 --> 01:09:59.242
Ta-ta-ta-ta. Who are you?
What do you want?

01:10:01.113 --> 01:10:05.184
Rage shouldn't be wasted on
those we have no quarrel with.

01:10:06.819 --> 01:10:08.788
So let's not disappoint them.

01:10:17.029 --> 01:10:18.828
What is this, hmm?

01:10:18.830 --> 01:10:23.032
Some kind of parlor fit for you
try to seduce me? No, no. no.
-I want you. Do you want me?

01:10:23.034 --> 01:10:27.469
Ehh! No, you're woman--

01:10:27.471 --> 01:10:29.471
She's got no penis for
me to play with.

01:10:29.473 --> 01:10:31.608
What is wrong with you and
your stupid lady brain.

01:10:31.610 --> 01:10:33.977
Always--

01:10:35.346 --> 01:10:37.246
Bob, get in here!

01:10:37.248 --> 01:10:40.051
Take care of these women.

01:10:56.168 --> 01:11:00.239
Trust me. You do not want
to hear what these women
have to say.

01:11:05.142 --> 01:11:06.578
Come on.

01:11:09.647 --> 01:11:11.313
We can get out
through here!

01:11:11.315 --> 01:11:14.386
Too high. We need a rope
or something.

01:11:18.222 --> 01:11:19.622
They're going to bust
their way in.

01:11:19.624 --> 01:11:21.657
Not if we barricade the door.

01:11:21.659 --> 01:11:22.894
Come on.

01:11:25.230 --> 01:11:26.161
Take that.

01:11:30.302 --> 01:11:32.004
This should buy us some time.

01:11:39.311 --> 01:11:40.513
Oh God.

01:11:41.113 --> 01:11:42.478
is it some kind of acid or
something?

01:11:42.480 --> 01:11:45.450
I don't know. It look magical.
I'm taking it.

01:11:47.686 --> 01:11:48.952
Okay. Come on.

01:11:48.954 --> 01:11:51.453
Books.
Come on.

01:11:51.455 --> 01:11:52.956
Swords.

01:11:52.958 --> 01:11:54.390
What the heck is this?

01:11:54.392 --> 01:11:58.430
Sword. Big flower thing.

01:12:05.037 --> 01:12:07.573
Jax, are you serious?

01:12:09.240 --> 01:12:12.943
Everything else Ace's shown us
in here has worked.
Why not this?

01:12:12.945 --> 01:12:16.048
How?
-I think it's a good idea.

01:12:19.618 --> 01:12:22.120
Ask.
-The Genie is a jerk.

01:12:23.254 --> 01:12:25.458
Do it! Hurry!

01:12:34.298 --> 01:12:38.335
- I don't have time to take a Rosetta Stone class.
-  Speak English!

01:12:38.337 --> 01:12:40.370
That's a demand.
Not a wish.

01:12:40.372 --> 01:12:42.040
What?

01:12:42.606 --> 01:12:44.307
How do I use that?

01:12:44.309 --> 01:12:48.611
You really want to know?
-Yes!
-I'll tell you.

01:12:48.613 --> 01:12:49.746
Are you ready?
-Yes.

01:12:56.754 --> 01:12:58.958
Oh my god! They're breaking in.

01:13:00.191 --> 01:13:01.424
Wake up!

01:13:01.426 --> 01:13:04.196
I know how to fly carpets!

01:13:06.297 --> 01:13:07.699
Come on.

01:13:09.434 --> 01:13:10.636
Get on.

01:13:12.303 --> 01:13:13.536
Steering.

01:13:13.538 --> 01:13:14.571
Breaking systems.

01:13:14.573 --> 01:13:18.308
- Ready?
- -Start the thing!

01:13:37.495 --> 01:13:39.028
Are you okay?

01:13:39.030 --> 01:13:40.429
Are you okay?

01:13:40.431 --> 01:13:42.367
I didn't need my spleen anyway.

01:13:43.802 --> 01:13:45.371
Oh no!

01:13:55.212 --> 01:13:57.212
The stone is okay.

01:13:57.214 --> 01:13:58.715
It's still in tact.

01:13:58.717 --> 01:14:00.550
Don't look directly into it,
Jax.

01:14:00.552 --> 01:14:03.289
Oh God.

01:14:03.488 --> 01:14:05.220
Ace was right.

01:14:05.222 --> 01:14:07.090
It does hurt to look at it.

01:14:07.092 --> 01:14:09.358
Aww, is it beautiful.

01:14:09.360 --> 01:14:13.830
Come on. We have to get Ace and
bring Manta to the authorities.

01:14:13.832 --> 01:14:15.165
Authorities?

01:14:15.167 --> 01:14:18.701
Sinbad, you're a wanted
man. They're just going to
arrest you.

01:14:18.703 --> 01:14:20.804
Then I'll do my time.

01:14:20.806 --> 01:14:24.139
I'm tired of hiding.
No more running away.

01:14:24.141 --> 01:14:25.642
You're going legit?

01:14:25.644 --> 01:14:29.315
I guess I am.

01:14:30.449 --> 01:14:32.615
I knew you were a lousy thief.

01:14:32.617 --> 01:14:34.020
I suck at it.

01:14:36.154 --> 01:14:39.288
You know, I have to admit,

01:14:39.290 --> 01:14:47.863
this whole time I secretly
blamed you for what your
father did to me.

01:14:47.865 --> 01:14:49.799
Taking credit for my work.

01:14:49.801 --> 01:14:52.138
Stealing everything I ever had.

01:14:55.640 --> 01:14:57.810
You're nothing like your father.

01:15:00.111 --> 01:15:02.545
I wish that were true.

01:15:11.222 --> 01:15:13.790
Why didn't you take the
stone and run?
- Yeah, with those things

01:15:13.792 --> 01:15:16.158
running every night?
I don't think so.

01:15:16.160 --> 01:15:18.460
And I did wait for you,
didn't I?

01:15:18.462 --> 01:15:22.298
You wanted to cut me out and
take the stone all for yourself.

01:15:22.300 --> 01:15:29.371
Don't tell me that my act was
so convincing that I fooled the
great Manta.

01:15:29.373 --> 01:15:33.645
Don't try to out bitch a bitch.

01:15:34.779 --> 01:15:37.850
Thank God you're alive.

01:15:38.350 --> 01:15:41.651
I was worried you'd been
knocked into a coma.

01:15:41.653 --> 01:15:43.152
Why are you doing this, Jax?

01:15:43.154 --> 01:15:47.256
Mr. Siridad! Just in time.

01:15:47.258 --> 01:15:48.858
You two are in this together.

01:15:48.860 --> 01:15:54.730
I found the location of the
stone and Manta brought the
man power to get it.

01:15:54.732 --> 01:16:00.836
And you almost ruined everything
with your big man muscles.

01:16:00.838 --> 01:16:02.475
Yeah.

01:16:03.876 --> 01:16:08.310
Of all the caves you could have
explored, Sinbad. Why that one?
Huh?

01:16:08.312 --> 01:16:11.447
All through I'm still not sure
why I still let you convince me

01:16:11.449 --> 01:16:13.750
I should leave the stone
where I found it.

01:16:13.752 --> 01:16:17.687
I was right about it being
guarded, wasn't I?

01:16:17.689 --> 01:16:20.389
Jax, why are you doing this?

01:16:20.391 --> 01:16:23.128
I have my reasons.

01:16:24.329 --> 01:16:28.932
One hundred million to be exact.

01:16:28.934 --> 01:16:32.635
One hundred million split
between us. Hmm?

01:16:32.637 --> 01:16:33.937
Of course.

01:16:33.939 --> 01:16:37.340
You said the stone couldn't be
used as a weapon.

01:16:37.342 --> 01:16:41.810
What mystical powers it has,
I still don't know.

01:16:41.812 --> 01:16:46.782
But it does have a
practical use.

01:16:46.784 --> 01:16:50.522
It is after all, it's
still a mineral.

01:16:54.226 --> 01:17:02.232
The Heart of Medusa is actually
a complex emerald made up of
chromium and vanadium.

01:17:02.234 --> 01:17:06.301
Chromium helps regulate your
blood sugar and vanadium is

01:17:06.303 --> 01:17:10.473
a very rare chemical capable
of binding steel together.

01:17:10.475 --> 01:17:14.277
The gun chips off a bit of
the gem here,

01:17:14.279 --> 01:17:17.714
the it oxides in
this chamber,

01:17:17.716 --> 01:17:22.417
and when the particles are
combined and projected into
someone--

01:17:22.419 --> 01:17:23.786
It turns them to stone.

01:17:23.788 --> 01:17:25.457
In a way.

01:17:26.257 --> 01:17:29.291
The overdose of chromium
ruptures your blood vessels,

01:17:29.293 --> 01:17:33.395
carrying the vanadium throughout
your body, hardening all your
organic tissue

01:17:33.397 --> 01:17:39.635
before you finally combust.
-We call it the Medusa 2.0.

01:17:39.637 --> 01:17:45.243
All through I wanted to call it
the gore gun, but Jax here
thought--

01:17:46.878 --> 01:17:50.279
Isn't it fascinating?

01:17:50.281 --> 01:17:51.684
Bravo.

01:17:52.484 --> 01:17:54.651
Why do you have Ace
and I tied up?

01:17:54.653 --> 01:17:55.952
Huh?

01:17:55.954 --> 01:17:58.353
To give you and audience?

01:17:58.355 --> 01:18:01.991
No, silly.

01:18:01.993 --> 01:18:04.727
So we can test it out.

01:18:04.729 --> 01:18:06.562
On you.

01:18:06.564 --> 01:18:11.834
Rock hard Sinbad right
in front of me.

01:18:11.836 --> 01:18:14.707
An new age is dawning.

01:18:15.373 --> 01:18:19.742
One where technology and
magic are combined.

01:18:19.744 --> 01:18:25.348
Unlike our ancestors, we won't
bow down and worship the gods.

01:18:25.350 --> 01:18:26.916
Yeah.

01:18:26.918 --> 01:18:34.426
This time around,
we are the gods.

01:18:36.761 --> 01:18:38.493
May I do the honors?

01:18:38.495 --> 01:18:41.831
Better have Cy. Just in case it
vaporizes whoever is holding it.

01:18:41.833 --> 01:18:44.434
We still have some of the kinks
to work out.

01:18:44.436 --> 01:18:46.705
Good idea.

01:18:47.638 --> 01:18:50.809
Cy, will you do the honors?

01:18:52.776 --> 01:18:55.346
You know I can hear you.
-What?

01:18:56.681 --> 01:19:00.782
Ace, I'm so sorry.

01:19:00.784 --> 01:19:03.655
No, you've inspired me.

01:19:07.391 --> 01:19:09.994
Just as I will inspire you.

01:19:11.596 --> 01:19:13.795
My friend, don't waste
your journey.

01:19:13.797 --> 01:19:14.897
Fire!

01:19:19.803 --> 01:19:20.902
Fire!

01:19:20.904 --> 01:19:22.738
It's still calibrating!

01:19:22.740 --> 01:19:25.041
Get'em you stupid idiot!

01:19:25.043 --> 01:19:27.379
- Where they go?
- That way!

01:19:36.020 --> 01:19:39.087
How do I stop this?

01:19:39.089 --> 01:19:43.395
Be more specific with your
intention to get what you want.

01:19:43.861 --> 01:19:46.027
I can't do this alone.
Can you--

01:19:46.029 --> 01:19:50.635
It is impossible for me--
-Kill anyone. I know.

01:19:53.937 --> 01:19:55.670
What should I do?

01:19:55.672 --> 01:20:01.743
I suggest using your enemy
to fight your enemy.

01:20:01.745 --> 01:20:03.449
The Furies?

01:20:04.449 --> 01:20:06.785
Man, they want to kill me.

01:20:07.819 --> 01:20:10.952
And you think I can get them
in my side?

01:20:10.954 --> 01:20:12.790
If that is your wish.

01:20:12.990 --> 01:20:16.461
Shall I bring them forward to
follow your will.

01:20:17.796 --> 01:20:18.995
How?

01:20:18.997 --> 01:20:20.899
It's daylight.

01:20:21.865 --> 01:20:23.935
Is it?

01:20:28.440 --> 01:20:30.473
Why did you summons us, Arabian?

01:20:30.475 --> 01:20:32.111
I don't mean to hurt you.

01:20:33.544 --> 01:20:34.876
I mean to serve you.

01:20:34.878 --> 01:20:38.514
I mean, if you're willing
to serve me.

01:20:38.516 --> 01:20:42.788
You can give is the weapon that
can also annihilate us?
-It's a trick.

01:20:44.221 --> 01:20:46.522
Look, we're on the same
side now, okay?

01:20:46.524 --> 01:20:48.624
We're not adversaries anymore.

01:20:48.626 --> 01:20:51.727
The enemy of my
enemy is also my friend.

01:20:51.729 --> 01:20:58.099
There's people up there
that have done some really
messed up stuff.

01:20:58.101 --> 01:21:00.670
I don't think you guys would
appreciate either. I think if
we--

01:21:00.672 --> 01:21:02.938
-What you stole from us

01:21:02.940 --> 01:21:05.741
other have perverted and
desecrated.

01:21:05.743 --> 01:21:08.109
Help me fight them to
get it back.

01:21:08.111 --> 01:21:10.479
This is a limited alliance.

01:21:10.481 --> 01:21:12.715
You're too much like the
one who cured us.

01:21:12.717 --> 01:21:14.483
If you think we'll
befriend you--
-I don't exactly want to

01:21:14.485 --> 01:21:16.551
have a picnic with
you guys either, okay?

01:21:16.553 --> 01:21:20.958
Could you stop blabbing and
start screaming?

01:21:21.226 --> 01:21:23.128
Protect yourself.

01:21:30.034 --> 01:21:31.567
Did you guys here that scream?

01:21:31.569 --> 01:21:33.172
Do you think those women
are coming back?

01:21:33.770 --> 01:21:36.639
If they so they're going have
to deal with me.

01:21:36.641 --> 01:21:38.206
The money is in the account.

01:21:38.208 --> 01:21:40.609
We fly to Russia tonight.

01:21:40.611 --> 01:21:43.011
First I need to fix the
calibration on this thing.

01:21:43.013 --> 01:21:45.014
So there's no delay
between shots.

01:21:45.016 --> 01:21:48.084
No, you will do as I say.

01:21:48.086 --> 01:21:49.684
Must I?

01:21:49.686 --> 01:21:54.156
Yes, dearest doctor.
You will.

01:21:54.158 --> 01:21:58.594
I am so sick of you talking
down to me.

01:21:58.596 --> 01:22:01.197
Too bad.

01:22:01.199 --> 01:22:02.732
Indeed.

01:22:15.046 --> 01:22:19.251
The queen is dead.
Long live the queen.

01:22:20.784 --> 01:22:22.587
Damn right.

01:22:32.763 --> 01:22:34.796
Hand over the weapon, Jax!

01:22:46.010 --> 01:22:48.513
Run!

01:22:51.048 --> 01:22:53.983
You get Sinbad.
I'll get the last one.

01:22:53.985 --> 01:22:56.688
You moron.

01:24:06.923 --> 01:24:09.392
Sinbad, come out. I'm
not playing hide and seek,

01:24:09.394 --> 01:24:11.597
especially not with my ex.

01:24:12.195 --> 01:24:14.429
She's picking us off one by one.

01:24:14.431 --> 01:24:16.999
We can't hide from here forever.

01:24:17.001 --> 01:24:18.904
So let her find me.

01:24:20.370 --> 01:24:21.937
Jax?

01:24:21.939 --> 01:24:23.104
I'm coming out.

01:24:23.106 --> 01:24:24.943
So we can talk.

01:24:27.244 --> 01:24:29.045
I've been thinking.

01:24:29.047 --> 01:24:31.817
Maybe it's not too late for us.

01:24:35.887 --> 01:24:37.152
Jax?

01:24:37.154 --> 01:24:38.987
It's not too late.

01:24:38.989 --> 01:24:41.726
We can still take that magic
carpet and fly to Cabo.

01:24:45.797 --> 01:24:46.999
Wait, wait, wait.

01:24:47.731 --> 01:24:49.331
Answer me one question.

01:24:49.333 --> 01:24:51.867
Do you believe in soul mate?

01:24:51.869 --> 01:24:53.368
No.

01:24:53.370 --> 01:24:55.103
Me neither.

01:24:55.105 --> 01:24:56.707
Aah!

01:25:02.980 --> 01:25:05.183
Give it to me! I've earned it!

01:25:23.735 --> 01:25:25.134
Please. We had a bargain.

01:25:25.136 --> 01:25:27.339
This has to end.

01:25:42.954 --> 01:25:45.054
I'm free.

01:25:45.056 --> 01:25:47.288
Unlock your heart.

01:25:47.290 --> 01:25:50.792
Stop your sufferings.
Set free your rage.

01:25:50.794 --> 01:25:53.895
Right now this rage is
all I got.

01:25:53.897 --> 01:25:55.766
Everyone I ever loved is dead.

01:25:56.066 --> 01:25:59.171
Every dream I have gone.

01:26:00.337 --> 01:26:03.339
Go to your ship, Sinbad.

01:26:03.341 --> 01:26:06.878
See why the
Jinn couldn't grant your
deepest wish.

01:26:07.477 --> 01:26:11.913
How could she? You can't
resurrect the living.

01:26:11.915 --> 01:26:13.318
Nick!

01:26:17.421 --> 01:26:18.953
You're alive!

01:26:18.955 --> 01:26:23.091
Dude! Dude!
I've been working all hard all
day to get the army to find you.

01:26:23.093 --> 01:26:26.127
The fact that I had no idea
where you were hindered
those plans a bit.

01:26:26.129 --> 01:26:28.029
Bro, I saw you drown.

01:26:28.031 --> 01:26:31.066
Yeah. A lifeboat pulled me out
the water that's to Daphne.

01:26:31.068 --> 01:26:34.202
I few up and didn't let the
Coast Guard sleep until they
found him.

01:26:34.204 --> 01:26:38.943
I got a bit of a bump on my head
but at least I got the boat
fixed up and running.

01:26:40.977 --> 01:26:42.210
What'd I miss?

01:26:42.212 --> 01:26:43.912
Nothing important.

01:26:43.914 --> 01:26:46.014
Everything all good
with the heart?

01:26:46.016 --> 01:26:48.818
Yeah. Yeah.

01:26:48.820 --> 01:26:51.085
Everything's just fine.

01:26:51.087 --> 01:26:52.787
Should I call off the troops?

01:26:52.789 --> 01:26:56.058
Yeah. Call them off right now.
They find out who we are, we're
all gonna be in trouble.

01:26:56.060 --> 01:26:57.158
Most definitely.

01:26:57.160 --> 01:26:58.963
Right. Right.

01:26:59.864 --> 01:27:03.499
So, can we go to Chile now?

01:27:03.501 --> 01:27:05.369
We can go...

01:27:06.470 --> 01:27:08.839
where ever we want.
