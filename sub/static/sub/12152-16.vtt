NARRATOR:
<i>Previously:</i>

00:02.425 --> 00:04.541
CORDELIA: The fire,
blotting out the sun...

00:04.705 --> 00:07.094
...those were the first steps
to something bigger.

00:07.265 --> 00:09.415
Connor, we're having a baby.

00:10.705 --> 00:12.297
- Gwen.
- Hi, there.

00:12.465 --> 00:13.739
- What are you?
- I'm a freak.

00:13.905 --> 00:16.135
Move! There we go.

00:16.305 --> 00:17.340
Angelus.

00:17.505 --> 00:21.703
- I'm telling you, I don't know this Beast.
- But Angelus might. We need Angelus.

00:23.225 --> 00:24.260
Angelus.

00:24.505 --> 00:27.338
There's something bigger.
The Beast has a boss.

00:27.545 --> 00:28.978
[ANGELUS WHISTLING]

00:30.185 --> 00:31.777
LILAH: He's gonna kill us.
- I know.

00:34.105 --> 00:36.016
Why do you think I let him out?

00:36.185 --> 00:40.781
Killing Angelus is the only way
to guarantee our family's safety.

00:42.945 --> 00:44.981
Connor, it's over. It's me.

00:45.345 --> 00:46.903
- We're back.
- It would seem.

00:47.065 --> 00:48.942
ANGEL: I know things...
CORDELIA: Sorry...

00:49.145 --> 00:52.660
...but if this is the speech
about how the worst is behind us...

00:52.825 --> 00:55.544
...you may want to save it for later.

00:58.745 --> 01:01.134
CORDELIA:
I know it's a bit of a shock.

01:01.345 --> 01:05.132
I mean, nobody's more shocked than me.
Okay, maybe him.

01:10.345 --> 01:13.223
Um, sorry to be so...

01:14.625 --> 01:18.538
But I'm, like you said,
kind of shocked.

01:18.745 --> 01:24.103
Yeah, because hasn't it only been like...?
Definitely shocked.

01:24.265 --> 01:27.496
I haven't been hiding
or ashamed or anything.

01:27.665 --> 01:31.021
It's just with the Beast
and his psycho master...

01:31.185 --> 01:34.734
...and then Faith and Willow
and all that dramarama.

01:34.905 --> 01:37.658
- Not to mention...
- Angelus?

01:39.465 --> 01:42.855
Everything's just been
so <i>Clash of the Titans</i> around here.

01:43.705 --> 01:47.300
I didn't want to be a distraction.

01:49.905 --> 01:51.224
Well!

01:51.385 --> 01:55.139
Put me on the short bus
and send me off to clueless school.

01:55.305 --> 02:01.016
A mystical pregnancy right under
my beak and not even a tingle.

02:01.225 --> 02:03.022
Huh.

02:03.825 --> 02:05.099
How long have you known?

02:05.465 --> 02:08.342
Some time after we
brought forth Angelus.

02:08.505 --> 02:11.178
That's a couple weeks.
Looks more like eight months.

02:11.385 --> 02:15.219
The last time Cordelia was impregnated,
she came to term overnight.

02:16.105 --> 02:18.938
That was a crawly, evil demon thing.

02:19.745 --> 02:20.939
This is different.

02:21.145 --> 02:25.536
Still, shouldn't we try
and find out what's in there?

02:25.905 --> 02:27.258
We already know.

02:29.785 --> 02:31.776
Our baby.

02:32.825 --> 02:34.577
Well, congratulations.

02:34.745 --> 02:36.463
You're gonna have a grand-spawn.

02:36.825 --> 02:38.622
You don't know what it's like.

02:38.945 --> 02:40.264
How scary it is.

02:42.105 --> 02:46.178
I'm gonna have a child, and all you
can do is joke because you don't like me.

02:48.505 --> 02:50.575
We shouldn't have told them.

02:54.465 --> 02:57.935
- Cordelia.
- I know it's hard to understand.

02:58.465 --> 03:01.821
None of you have ever had a living being
growing inside of you.

03:03.545 --> 03:05.137
And this...

03:06.145 --> 03:09.057
...my sweet baby...

03:09.425 --> 03:11.302
We're connected.

03:11.865 --> 03:16.017
I feel what it feels, and I can't explain it,
but I sense its goodness...

03:16.585 --> 03:18.223
...its love.

You'll see.

03:31.665 --> 03:35.135
My baby will be here soon,
and then you'll all see.

03:40.905 --> 03:42.304
Players

04:53.785 --> 04:55.184
How'd you do that?

04:55.385 --> 04:58.218
I'm a thief. Got my stuff?

04:59.785 --> 05:01.662
Would you stop it?

05:01.865 --> 05:04.379
- Stop what?
- Acting shifty.

05:06.505 --> 05:08.780
You've never done this before,
have you?

05:10.225 --> 05:12.056
Let me give you a tip, sugar bear.

05:12.225 --> 05:14.864
There are over 8 million
people in this city...

05:15.025 --> 05:18.381
...as far as anyone can tell,
we're two of them, just a normal couple.

05:18.585 --> 05:21.861
Nobody's gonna give us a
second look if you stop acting shifty.

05:22.025 --> 05:25.938
Look, these are very powerful people
that you're going up against.

05:26.225 --> 05:28.944
- lf they catch you, they'll kill...
- I know the risk.

05:29.105 --> 05:31.414
But I'm going in there
with or without your help.

05:31.625 --> 05:34.059
And I'm not coming out without Lisa.

05:36.785 --> 05:39.345
So are we gonna dance, or what?

05:48.145 --> 05:51.421
That's everything.
Security, blueprints, background.

05:54.425 --> 05:57.417
There, wasn't so bad, was it?

06:02.785 --> 06:05.583
So is it that obvious?

06:06.225 --> 06:10.264
- That I've never done...?
- Trench coat, definite rookie mistake.

06:11.745 --> 06:13.940
So I should dress more like you?

06:17.345 --> 06:21.941
You know, maybe when this is all over,
you and I could...

06:22.145 --> 06:23.976
[THUNDER ROLLS]

06:25.425 --> 06:26.938
Holy!

06:30.665 --> 06:33.054
Really, I'm fine.

06:33.345 --> 06:35.461
Thanks for asking.

06:38.985 --> 06:43.024
Were we too harsh?
I was just asking.

06:43.385 --> 06:46.775
No. They were bound to skulk off
to neutral corners.

06:46.945 --> 06:48.094
Two vampires hook up...

06:48.265 --> 06:51.416
...and for the only time in vamp history,
have a kid, our boy Connor.

06:51.585 --> 06:55.578
Connor grows up, knocks it out with
Cordelia, part-demon, former high being.

06:55.785 --> 06:59.744
Quick as you can say Easy-Bake Oven,
there's a gigantic bun in hers.

06:59.905 --> 07:01.577
I don't think we were too harsh.

07:01.785 --> 07:05.221
The first time Connor tried to attack
Angelus, Lorne's sanctuary spell...

07:05.385 --> 07:09.014
...knocked him to Abilene.
- Which means Connor is part-demon.

07:09.225 --> 07:12.376
Yeah, well that was before my
spell went all flop-a-palooza.

07:12.545 --> 07:16.379
Having two part-demon parents
might explain the "whoosh" factor.

07:16.545 --> 07:18.854
Not gonna be long until
"whoosh" turns into "pop."

07:19.025 --> 07:23.860
Speaking of pop, don't you think our
leader should be part of this confab?

07:24.545 --> 07:29.778
Easy-Bake, flop-a-palooza,
whoosh, pop. I don't skulk.

07:31.505 --> 07:35.054
I've been thinking
about the past few weeks and Angelus.

07:35.425 --> 07:38.303
Angel, you can't feel guilty
for anything Angelus did.

07:38.625 --> 07:40.775
I don't. I knew the risks.

07:41.145 --> 07:42.498
We all did.

07:43.185 --> 07:45.460
Some of us paid
a higher price than others.

07:48.825 --> 07:50.383
Angelus didn't kill Lilah.

07:51.705 --> 07:55.254
She was already dead,
killed by the Beast.

07:57.505 --> 08:01.020
Well, that's less terrible.

08:01.385 --> 08:03.535
There's no excuse...

08:03.705 --> 08:06.742
...for what Angelus did to her...

08:07.945 --> 08:09.981
...but I'm sorry for your loss.

08:14.545 --> 08:15.978
We got two pressing matters:

08:16.345 --> 08:19.781
Figuring out Cordelia's pregnancy
and destroying the Beastmaster.

08:19.945 --> 08:22.584
- Lorne, you're...
- Reliable as a cheap fortune cookie?

08:22.785 --> 08:24.855
I was gonna say
a guy with good contacts.

08:25.145 --> 08:27.136
Must be rumblings
about the new player.

08:27.305 --> 08:30.456
Talk to your sources.
See if anyone knows anything.

08:30.665 --> 08:32.337
- I'm your demon.
ANGEL: Fred, Wesley.

08:32.544 --> 08:35.696
If there's experts on mystical births,
we're it.

08:36.065 --> 08:39.740
We'll pull the files on Darla and her
pregnancy, see what we can find.

08:39.945 --> 08:42.299
Gunn, I want you to sit tight for now.

08:42.465 --> 08:44.296
Never hurts to have muscle on deck.

08:44.505 --> 08:48.817
In the meantime, has to be a reason
why the Beastmaster wanted Angelus.

08:49.025 --> 08:50.458
I'll piece together what I know.

08:50.665 --> 08:53.133
Things he said when he was
in my head, everything.

08:53.305 --> 08:56.138
- Maybe something will...
GWEN: Strike you?

08:57.865 --> 09:00.663
Careful what you wish for.

09:01.185 --> 09:03.983
Well, look who's back,
now that the lights are on.

09:04.145 --> 09:05.863
Oh, missed you too, babe.

09:06.025 --> 09:08.903
Gwen, it's really not a great time
for a social call.

09:09.065 --> 09:11.101
We're pretty swamped. You know...

09:12.705 --> 09:14.377
...Apocalypse.

09:15.665 --> 09:18.737
The thing is, there's a girl,
she's in trouble.

09:19.145 --> 09:21.454
- That's what you guys do, right?
- Well, yeah.

09:21.625 --> 09:23.422
I'm in a jam.
Can't get out of it alone.

09:23.585 --> 09:26.975
I need someone suave, a guy
who can handle himself in a tight spot.

09:27.585 --> 09:30.179
- Gwen, I'd love to help...
- I meant him.

09:46.425 --> 09:48.859
I've been looking all over for you.

09:54.105 --> 09:55.902
Connor...

09:56.425 --> 10:00.543
...what they said,
you can't let it bother you.

10:00.705 --> 10:02.775
- I don't care what they say.
CORDELIA: Really?

10:03.145 --> 10:06.342
That why you retreated
to the Fortress of Solitude?

10:08.625 --> 10:10.775
It doesn't make sense.

10:10.945 --> 10:14.221
Freaking out over pregnancy is the m.o.
with the gang around here.

10:14.585 --> 10:19.022
Not them. You.
All that stuff you said about Angelus.

10:19.545 --> 10:21.854
And Willow,
she didn't open a gate to evil...

10:22.025 --> 10:25.461
...she put back Angel's soul.
I almost killed him.

10:26.145 --> 10:29.979
But you didn't. Angel's back,
everything worked out.

10:30.545 --> 10:34.379
Everything happens for a reason,
even if it doesn't always seem that way.

10:34.745 --> 10:37.100
- How can you say that?
- Think about it.

10:37.265 --> 10:39.654
You sinking Angel
to the bottom of the ocean...

10:40.025 --> 10:44.257
...being kicked out of the house, me not
knowing who I was and coming to you...

10:44.825 --> 10:48.056
...all of those moments
and a million others led to this miracle.

10:48.265 --> 10:50.654
But sending me down to the basement?

10:51.305 --> 10:54.456
I had the stake.
What was the reason for that?

10:54.865 --> 10:57.777
I thought our baby was in danger.

10:57.945 --> 11:03.417
All my instincts told me that killing
Angelus was the only way to protect it.

11:07.425 --> 11:08.619
But you were wrong.

11:15.265 --> 11:19.543
What's important is when I needed help,
you were there for me.

11:21.785 --> 11:27.496
Now I know I can trust you completely,
no matter what.

11:28.225 --> 11:32.059
See? Everything happens for a reason.

11:39.545 --> 11:45.336
Connor, before our baby comes,
I might ask you to do some things...

11:45.545 --> 11:47.183
...for us.

11:48.305 --> 11:51.263
And I want you to remember...

11:51.945 --> 11:54.220
...there's always a reason.

11:56.465 --> 11:58.296
I'll remember.

12:07.305 --> 12:08.863
So why me?

12:09.025 --> 12:12.176
I told you,
I need a suave guy in a tight spot.

12:12.345 --> 12:16.338
Suave.
You been collecting these for a while?

12:16.505 --> 12:20.293
Yeah, I get one each trip. Just brought
the dolphin back from Tahiti.

12:20.465 --> 12:22.456
You collect anything when you travel?

12:22.625 --> 12:26.584
Yeah, I got a big old scar on my thigh
from Boyle Heights...

12:26.785 --> 12:29.583
...piece of vamp stake I picked up
in Alhambra...

12:29.745 --> 12:32.384
...and a couple of burn marks
on my hip from Encino.

12:32.545 --> 12:34.376
Name a town,
I'll show you the souvenir.

12:34.585 --> 12:37.179
- I didn't mean to...
- No, I'm not complaining.

12:37.345 --> 12:40.940
I've seen more here than most
people seen traveling around the world.

12:41.105 --> 12:42.618
Someday maybe.

12:43.305 --> 12:47.059
What's so big and bad that Electro-Gwen
needs my super-suave assistance?

12:47.225 --> 12:49.455
- Something about a girl in trouble?
GWEN: Yeah.

12:49.625 --> 12:51.934
I did a black-bag deal
for this corp.

12:52.105 --> 12:54.824
Happens all the time.
Two companies vie for a contract.

12:54.985 --> 12:57.863
Company A hires me to make sure
Company B's thingamabob...

12:58.025 --> 13:00.619
...doesn't so much bob as bust.

13:00.785 --> 13:03.094
Company A gets a
multimillion-dollar payday.

13:03.265 --> 13:05.540
Right.
But this time, Company B fought back.

13:05.705 --> 13:09.175
They kidnapped this girl.
Her name's Lisa.

13:09.345 --> 13:11.256
She's the daughter of the guy
who hired me.

13:11.425 --> 13:14.144
- Nobody can go to the cops, because...
- Of what I did.

13:14.305 --> 13:19.140
So you see, it's my fault. I have
to save her and I can't do it alone.

13:22.505 --> 13:24.382
Don't ask.

13:24.585 --> 13:27.338
This is everything I could get
on the man who's holding her.

13:27.505 --> 13:31.020
His name is Takeshi Morimoto.
He's the head of the company I tanked.

13:31.185 --> 13:34.541
He'll kill her if Company A doesn't
come clean about what they did.

13:34.745 --> 13:36.258
This dude's a serious player.

13:36.425 --> 13:40.179
Chairman emeritus, honorary degrees,
all kinds of charity work:

13:40.345 --> 13:43.382
Cancer research, wildlife preservation,
the zoo committee.

13:43.545 --> 13:45.900
Bank fraud, smuggling,
money laundering.

13:46.065 --> 13:48.704
GWEN: And now kidnapping.
- This guy know about you?

13:49.065 --> 13:52.341
Nope. That's why I think we have
a shot at getting to the girl.

13:52.705 --> 13:54.741
They're keeping her
at his gated compound.

13:54.905 --> 14:00.696
Armed guards, infrared surveillance,
dogs, the works.

14:01.665 --> 14:03.815
If we're gonna have half a chance...

14:04.505 --> 14:08.020
Stop grinning and share the joke
with the entire class.

14:08.225 --> 14:11.376
- You think this is impossible.
- No, I think it's fantastic.

14:11.585 --> 14:15.544
I spent most of this year trapped in
what I can only describe as a turgid...

14:15.705 --> 14:17.536
...supernatural soap opera.

14:17.705 --> 14:20.902
The fact that I have a chance
to go out and really help somebody...

14:21.065 --> 14:23.420
It feels good to be doing good.

14:24.305 --> 14:27.502
So how are we breaking
into Fort Knox?

14:27.905 --> 14:30.373
GWEN:
<i>We're walking in the front door.</i>

14:36.065 --> 14:37.544
- How are you doing?
- You tell me.

14:37.705 --> 14:40.094
I'm thinking James Bond
never looked this fine.

14:40.265 --> 14:41.254
You're right.

14:41.425 --> 14:44.064
I'd feel better if we were packing
some of his weapons.

14:44.225 --> 14:46.341
Charles, we are the secret weapons.

14:47.785 --> 14:49.059
- Nervous?
- No.

14:49.225 --> 14:52.137
I've gotten into clubs with tighter
security than this.

14:57.065 --> 14:58.896
Go ahead.

15:02.905 --> 15:04.702
Go ahead, sir.

15:05.345 --> 15:07.301
One down, one to go.

15:07.465 --> 15:10.184
How will your electro-thing do
with these metal detectors?

15:10.345 --> 15:12.176
Piece of cake.

15:22.625 --> 15:25.537
Now if we can just get out
as easily as we got in, we'll...

15:30.145 --> 15:32.295
Why did I even say that?

15:41.265 --> 15:43.221
What seems to be the problem?

15:43.585 --> 15:46.383
Electronic imprint on your invitation's
been altered.

15:46.745 --> 15:49.418
I can explain that.
I was struck by lightning.

15:51.425 --> 15:52.904
Really.

15:54.065 --> 15:57.262
- See how my life sucks?
- Step this way, please.

15:57.465 --> 15:59.023
Please don't make a scene.

15:59.385 --> 16:01.615
A bit late for that,
with the beeping and batons.

16:01.825 --> 16:04.623
- Maybe it's not our night.
- Then we make it our night.

16:04.985 --> 16:08.421
This is my one shot, and I'm
not leaving without you know who.

16:10.305 --> 16:12.455
Now, if that means we do it
the hard way...

16:23.305 --> 16:25.182
Didn't follow that last bit.

16:25.345 --> 16:28.143
Shot my entire Japanese vocabulary
when I said hello.

16:28.345 --> 16:30.734
The gesture is still appreciated.

16:31.105 --> 16:33.573
Mr. Morimoto, I'm Charles Gunn.

16:33.985 --> 16:36.453
We met at the zoo benefit last year.

16:37.145 --> 16:39.705
You don't remember me, do you?

16:39.985 --> 16:42.579
Your wife held that monkey
after my girlfriend did.

16:42.745 --> 16:46.420
Ugly little gray thing?
The monkey, not my girl.

16:46.625 --> 16:50.459
Gwen, you remember Mr. Morimoto.
We met him at the zoo benefit.

16:50.625 --> 16:53.344
- How could I forget?
GUNN: Mr. Morimoto...

16:53.505 --> 16:56.178
...in case we don't have
an opportunity to speak later...

16:56.345 --> 16:59.257
...do me the honor
of accepting this humble gift...

16:59.785 --> 17:02.857
...to thank you for inviting us
into your beautiful home.

17:03.065 --> 17:06.137
- You're too generous.
- Please, it's just a trinket.

17:18.744 --> 17:22.896
- It's beautiful.
- Well, I read somewhere you love tigers.

17:23.065 --> 17:27.058
Truly exquisite. Thank you.

17:29.425 --> 17:31.063
If you'll follow me, please.

17:31.545 --> 17:33.740
- Okay, we tried it your way.

All right, go ahead.

An infant Gatbar demon.
The spikes grow to full size in the womb.

18:01.345 --> 18:03.097
Ouch.

18:03.585 --> 18:07.055
Gross factor aside, these pregnancies
all seem to be...

18:07.225 --> 18:12.174
...run-of-the-mill demon life-cycle stuff.
Nothing mystical about them.

18:16.025 --> 18:17.458
They're just pictures, Fred.

18:17.825 --> 18:21.261
It's the pictures in my mind
that are getting me.

18:21.945 --> 18:24.584
I can't stop thinking about
Connor and Cordy...

18:24.745 --> 18:28.181
...hiding up in that room,
imagining what they do up there.

18:28.345 --> 18:30.575
It's like being stuck in a bad movie...

18:30.745 --> 18:33.543
...with those <i>Clockwork Orange</i>
clampy things on my eyeballs.

18:33.825 --> 18:36.703
Why imagine?
Reality's disturbing enough.

18:39.505 --> 18:44.579
How did he and Cordy get all couple-y?

18:44.745 --> 18:47.464
They were probably
as surprised as anyone.

18:50.945 --> 18:53.584
But they were both lost...

We were fighting on opposite sides,
but it was the same war.

19:29.145 --> 19:30.737
But you hated her.

20:05.505 --> 20:08.099
So when did you become
Mr. Japanese Ambassador?

20:08.265 --> 20:11.541
You watch enough samurai movies,
you learn things about the culture.

20:11.705 --> 20:12.979
The first is <i>reishiki...</i>

20:13.145 --> 20:16.057

proper etiquette.

the value of a thoughtful gift.

20:19.905 --> 20:22.294
- You mean, that gift you stole.
- Yeah, sorry.

20:22.465 --> 20:24.501
Hope it wasn't too valuable.

20:24.905 --> 20:27.260
I'll let you in on a little secret.

20:29.105 --> 20:30.424
You stole it back?

20:30.665 --> 20:33.577
It's not like 18th-century jade's
falling off trucks.

20:35.385 --> 20:36.738
What?

20:38.225 --> 20:41.581
Is that her? Shouldn't she be tied
to a chair or something?

20:41.825 --> 20:45.659
Tied up or dressed up, she's a prisoner.
Look at the muscle around her.

20:46.145 --> 20:51.139
I'm gonna see if I can get a better look.
No. Keep an eye on Morimoto.

- It's okay by me.

Kind of in the middle

- Not really.

21:23.985 --> 21:25.703

To be honest, I'm almost pining
for the halcyon days of the Beast.

21:32.825 --> 21:36.943
Right. It's not like he slaughtered
hundreds of people with his bare hands.

21:37.305 --> 21:41.139
- The Beast was just a flunky.
- Who did his master's bidding.

21:41.505 --> 21:46.579
Killing Manny, stealing my soul,
murdering Lilah.

21:47.265 --> 21:52.055
Those were surgical strikes, not
the smash-and-trash style of the Beast.

21:52.825 --> 21:56.101
But if Lava Boy didn't do all that,
who did?

21:56.705 --> 22:00.334
- His master.
- I'm his master.

You don't understand.
This was in my head.

22:21.945 --> 22:25.062
I've heard him. And he's insane
enough to pull those stunts.

22:25.225 --> 22:28.137
When you say "insane,"
you mean, like, diabolical?

22:28.505 --> 22:30.416
No, I mean, like,
deluded and demented.

22:30.585 --> 22:33.577
No, he spoke to me in this cheesy,
self-important voice.

22:33.745 --> 22:35.815
I bet he doesn't even
have a master plan.

22:36.065 --> 22:38.454
He's just making it up
as he goes along.

22:39.345 --> 22:41.176
Hey.

22:41.385 --> 22:43.057
Don't worry, we'll figure it out.

Wait for my signal.

Now you did it.

25:44.345 --> 25:47.781
...whacking on a giant lava demon
and more vamps than I can count.

25:47.945 --> 25:51.540
Almost forgot how good it feels
to just let off a little steam.

26:03.345 --> 26:05.415
All right, let's get you out of here.

26:06.785 --> 26:11.222
- It's okay. I'm here to take you home.
- I am home.

26:12.385 --> 26:16.856
- No, you've been kidnapped.
- Get out of my house.

Your name's not Lisa, is it?

26:20.985 --> 26:24.739
I'm Aiko Morimoto. And when my daddy
finds out you tried to hurt me...

26:24.905 --> 26:26.896
...he's going to kill you.

26:39.105 --> 26:41.061
- It's you.
- It was the scanners, wasn't it?

26:41.225 --> 26:43.261
Why you wanted me.
Angel, no heartbeat.

26:43.425 --> 26:46.064
Security scan of a dead guy
might raise eyebrows.

26:46.265 --> 26:49.621
For about five seconds, I thought
you might care about something.

26:49.785 --> 26:52.015
So what if I didn't tell you
about my plan?

26:52.225 --> 26:56.662
So what if set you up for a fall? When's
the last time you had this much fun?

26:57.505 --> 26:59.575
I saw your face.
You were having a great time.

26:59.745 --> 27:02.578
- It's because I thought I was doing good.
- You were.

27:02.905 --> 27:06.215
Just not the kind that involves
saving a princess from an evil king.

27:06.505 --> 27:09.258
- So Lisa doesn't exist?
- Yes, she does.

27:09.425 --> 27:13.418
I'd have liberated her from this steel
tomb by now if you'd stop yapping.

27:15.105 --> 27:18.859
It's a military acronym.
Localized lonic Sensory Activator.

27:19.225 --> 27:22.740
- L-l-S-A.
- A weapon? Lisa's a weapon?

27:23.105 --> 27:25.665
Not a weapon,
a covert device worn by black-ops.

27:25.825 --> 27:28.385
Regulates body temp,
heartbeat, body chemistry.

27:28.705 --> 27:32.220
Morimoto's company designed it, and
I've been hired to steal the beta test.

27:32.385 --> 27:35.422
- God bless America.
- Actually, China or North Korea.

27:35.585 --> 27:38.861
Not really sure. Morimoto's selling it
to the highest bidder.

27:39.025 --> 27:41.220
And who are you stealing it for?

27:41.385 --> 27:43.979
Look, there are two things
that make me a good thief.

27:44.145 --> 27:46.943
I steal what I'm paid to,
and I don't ask many questions.

27:47.105 --> 27:48.504
Well, good luck with that.

27:49.745 --> 27:53.533
Nothing's changed. Morimoto's
still a bad guy, you're still a good one.

27:53.785 --> 27:57.141
I can't believe I took time
out of the Apocalypse for this.

27:57.425 --> 28:02.021
Even the pres takes vacations.
Besides, they need you, they'll call.

28:04.465 --> 28:08.663
Come on, we started this together.
Let's finish it the same way.

28:09.105 --> 28:11.903
- It's not the same.
- You can keep the suit.

28:26.265 --> 28:29.462
You know, this would be a lot easier
if you two weren't hovering.

28:31.305 --> 28:33.102
- No rush.
- Take your time.

The one Angelus destroyed after the

Angel's been visualizing the text,
trying to re-create it.

28:48.945 --> 28:51.220
Just, you know, a little thing I can do.

28:52.305 --> 28:54.296
You think there was
something in that book...

28:54.465 --> 28:56.456
...that High-and-Spitey
didn't want us to know?

28:56.665 --> 28:57.780
He's hiding something.

28:57.945 --> 29:01.460
I recognize the text.
It's early Fallorian code system.

29:01.825 --> 29:07.104
Let's see.

29:14.945 --> 29:17.140
- Damn it!
- It's a tricky language.

29:17.345 --> 29:20.064
An inverted serif can alter
the meaning of a passage.

29:20.585 --> 29:23.463
- What now?
- I try again.

29:38.025 --> 29:41.495
- Crap.
- No, this is the easy one.

29:50.065 --> 29:51.339
We're out of here.

29:51.545 --> 29:53.775
- We should split up...
- No, we're not doing that.

29:53.945 --> 29:57.620
- Either we both make it out or...
- Neither of us do.

30:04.465 --> 30:06.057
Try this one.

30:08.065 --> 30:11.535
Something about strangling poultry.

30:13.985 --> 30:18.456
- That's it. I gotta get out of here.
- Easy does it, <i>compadre.</i>

30:18.625 --> 30:21.617
No huffy exits before
I spill the joyous news.

30:21.785 --> 30:23.503
- About the baby?
- About <i>El Jefe?</i>

30:23.865 --> 30:28.336
No and no. My sources got nothing
on mystical birth and/or the Big Kahuna.

30:28.905 --> 30:31.100
But Wanda,
that demon you recommended...

30:31.265 --> 30:37.215
...what a peach. She sold me a cleansing
abracadabra to clear my muddled mind.

30:37.585 --> 30:39.223
You're empathic again?

30:39.385 --> 30:43.458
Please. You think this Dungeons and
Dragons cloak is a fashion statement?

30:43.865 --> 30:46.743
- I gotta do this whole song and dance.
- We're getting nowhere.

30:46.905 --> 30:50.136
- lf you need extra hands.
- Sorry, I can only take my two.

30:50.305 --> 30:52.375
Ritual has to be performed solo.

30:52.545 --> 30:56.936
Just me and my shadow,
secluded in a dark, dusty nowhere-land.

30:57.305 --> 31:00.297
But the upside is,
I will be all systems go come sunrise.

31:00.505 --> 31:03.383
- Then you'll be able to read me?
- No worries, dumpling...

31:03.545 --> 31:08.539
...come morning, I will be a lean,
mean, belly-reading machine.

31:12.225 --> 31:14.898
Put that on the desk and step away.

31:17.145 --> 31:20.342
- Set it down now.
- No.

31:21.385 --> 31:23.853
I don't think you realize
who you're up against.

31:24.065 --> 31:27.102
If it's those two girls,
I already kicked their ass once.

31:28.745 --> 31:31.862
But when you put it like that...
Maybe we should.

31:32.025 --> 31:33.583
I won't give it back.

31:34.105 --> 31:35.823
I can't.

31:36.465 --> 31:38.899
- I'm not dying for this.
- I'm finishing the job!

31:39.065 --> 31:41.295
- We're busted.
- I'm not leaving without it.

31:41.465 --> 31:43.979
- Then you're not leaving. Finish it.
- Give it to him.

31:44.185 --> 31:46.016
- No, I need it.
- I said, finish it!

31:46.185 --> 31:47.584
It's mine!

32:05.025 --> 32:06.538
Liar.

32:07.065 --> 32:10.580
You're not stealing it for someone else.
It's for you.

32:10.745 --> 32:12.622
You think it'll fix you.

32:23.505 --> 32:26.065
LORNE:
Oh, fudgicle.

32:57.025 --> 32:59.300
Back where he belongs.

32:59.785 --> 33:01.935
I gotta give you credit.
You are stubborn.

33:02.305 --> 33:06.503
- I know what I want.
- I get that. At least I used to.

33:06.665 --> 33:09.702
- Things aren't so clear anymore.
- You seemed pretty clear tonight.

33:10.065 --> 33:13.057
Adrenaline rush,
when I was trying to save that girl.

33:13.225 --> 33:15.614
I meant when you were saving me.

33:16.265 --> 33:17.983
Hey, I'm just the muscle.

33:18.345 --> 33:21.815
Don't knock the muscle, buddy.
Makes the girls go knocky in the knees.

33:22.505 --> 33:25.417
If that's all you were, we couldn't
have gotten into that party.

33:25.705 --> 33:29.380
You would've gotten in. The damage
would've been significantly higher.

33:29.545 --> 33:31.615
Thanks to your
brains-over-brawn approach.

33:31.905 --> 33:34.339
Not so much brains
as too many movies.

33:34.905 --> 33:39.581
Man, they have done a number on you.
You believe this "I'm the muscle" crap.

33:39.945 --> 33:42.743
- This your version of a pep talk?
- Could be. Need one?

33:42.945 --> 33:46.620
- No.
- Good. Not my area of expertise.

33:48.465 --> 33:51.696
So why do you stay,
if that's all they see in you?

33:52.065 --> 33:55.057
I'm a fighter, born and raised.

33:56.905 --> 33:58.736
You love being a thief?

33:59.425 --> 34:01.222
I'm a freak.

34:01.785 --> 34:04.379
Being a thief
makes me part of something...

34:04.545 --> 34:06.979
...and not a part at the same time.

34:07.265 --> 34:08.493
Tonight...

34:09.105 --> 34:11.016
Yeah, kind of loved it.

34:12.505 --> 34:14.780
You know, for someone loving life...

34:15.145 --> 34:17.375
...you seemed awfully willing
to die for this.

34:20.105 --> 34:22.665
What you saw tonight,
that's as bad as it gets.

34:22.824 --> 34:24.815
But even at its best...

34:26.304 --> 34:28.455
That thing might let me be...

34:29.225 --> 34:32.058
Well, not normal, but...

34:32.264 --> 34:34.733
Hold hands maybe.

34:35.945 --> 34:40.813
So, yeah, guess I was willing to die,
or even...

34:42.465 --> 34:45.422
- You wouldn't understand.
- Sure I do.

34:45.665 --> 34:47.781
Brainy, remember?

34:52.385 --> 34:55.103
You want to show
me how this thing works?

35:17.705 --> 35:19.616
How you fire it up?

35:19.905 --> 35:22.738
It's not an X-Box.
Just put it on.

35:24.385 --> 35:25.898
Careful.

35:29.985 --> 35:31.304
Ow.

35:32.505 --> 35:34.336
Like I said.

35:41.905 --> 35:43.543
It's chilly.

35:46.545 --> 35:49.059
[HUMMING]

35:51.545 --> 35:52.534
What's it doing?

35:52.865 --> 35:55.663
You ever see one of those
body-snatcher movies?

36:00.905 --> 36:02.975
Feel any different?

36:03.225 --> 36:04.897
Yeah.

36:06.345 --> 36:08.222
Not so much.

36:24.665 --> 36:26.735
I think it worked.

36:33.465 --> 36:35.217
It feels good.

36:38.465 --> 36:40.217
So...

36:40.385 --> 36:42.216
...if you couldn't touch...

36:43.705 --> 36:46.139
...guess that means you've never...
- Nope.

36:48.145 --> 36:49.464
Nope.

36:51.705 --> 36:53.457
Anyway, um...

36:53.625 --> 36:56.139
...thanks for turning me...

36:56.305 --> 36:57.863
...off.

36:58.865 --> 37:00.742
Anytime.

37:00.985 --> 37:02.782
Thank you.

37:03.425 --> 37:05.859
For what? The guards?

37:06.025 --> 37:09.176
The suit?
The almost dying?

37:11.225 --> 37:13.420
The most fun I've had...

37:17.025 --> 37:18.583
...since...

37:25.705 --> 37:27.616
You know, um...

37:31.545 --> 37:35.538
That device, it's a prototype.
It might not hold.

37:36.465 --> 37:39.821
Well, you've already killed me once.

37:41.425 --> 37:45.054
If it happens again,
you know where my battery is.

38:42.985 --> 38:46.660
[LORNE SINGING]

39:28.385 --> 39:29.818
Angel.

39:51.025 --> 39:54.495
Has Cordy been a bad, bad girl?
