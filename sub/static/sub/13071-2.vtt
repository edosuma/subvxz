00:01.269 --> 00:02.636
* Previously on BrainDead...*

00:02.670 --> 00:05.706
* Some kind of meteor
came down *

00:05.739 --> 00:07.075
* No one knows where it's from

00:07.108 --> 00:08.376
* They shipped it off

00:08.409 --> 00:10.544
* So they could study it
in Washington *

00:10.578 --> 00:12.346
* Guess what?
It's filled with space bugs *

00:12.380 --> 00:14.482
* Now they're loose
and eating peoples' brains *

00:15.849 --> 00:17.318
* Poor Laurel only wants

00:17.351 --> 00:18.652
* To make her documentaries

00:18.686 --> 00:20.654
* She's out of money

00:20.688 --> 00:22.323
* So she works for Luke,
her brother *

00:22.356 --> 00:24.592
* He's a Democratic senator

00:24.625 --> 00:27.095
* She listens
to constituents complain *

00:28.562 --> 00:30.198
* Gareth is working for

00:30.231 --> 00:31.299
* Red Wheatus who is a senator

00:31.332 --> 00:33.201
* A Southerner, Republican

00:33.234 --> 00:35.103
* A drunk

00:35.136 --> 00:37.171
* Government is shutting down

00:37.205 --> 00:38.606
* Until they find
a work-around *

00:38.639 --> 00:41.209
* Deal they make
looks like a slam-dunk *

00:41.242 --> 00:43.111
* But space bugs crawl
into Red's brain *

00:43.144 --> 00:44.712
* And start controlling him

00:44.745 --> 00:46.714
* He steals a Democrat

00:46.747 --> 00:48.082
* And flips him to Republican

00:48.116 --> 00:49.550
* The shutdown happens

00:49.583 --> 00:51.685
* And now everybody's
mad again *

00:51.719 --> 00:54.555
* Laurel discovers Scarlett
sleeping with her brother *

00:54.588 --> 00:56.224
* And it looks like Scarlett

00:56.257 --> 00:58.726
* Probably has
a space bug problem, too *

00:58.759 --> 00:59.793
* You know your day was lousy

00:59.827 --> 01:01.762
* When somebody's head

01:01.795 --> 01:03.631
* Explodes on you.

01:05.533 --> 01:07.535
TRUMP (on TV):
I can tell you,
they are very ashamed.

01:07.568 --> 01:10.638
Many, many e-mails where she's
asking for her job back.

01:10.671 --> 01:12.273
Many of the women
have come forward saying,

01:12.306 --> 01:14.208
"Honestly, we have great respect
for Donald Trump.

01:14.242 --> 01:15.476
I like Donald Trump very much."

01:15.509 --> 01:17.145
They should be ashamed
of themselves.

01:17.178 --> 01:20.214
MISTY:
Yep, the Democrats
are at it again.

01:20.248 --> 01:23.651
It's day four of the great
government shutdown

01:23.684 --> 01:26.354
brought to you by your friendly
neighborhood Democrat congress.

01:26.387 --> 01:28.822
Many are pointing their fingers
at the Republican Party

01:28.856 --> 01:31.792
for putting 100,000 government
employees out of work.

01:31.825 --> 01:34.428
The only thing to come out of
the last government shutdown

01:34.462 --> 01:37.298
was a lot of new D.C. babies.

01:37.331 --> 01:38.666
But let's not forget

01:38.699 --> 01:40.134
during that previous
government shutdown,

01:40.168 --> 01:42.636
the U.S. economy
lost $24 billion.

01:42.670 --> 01:47.675
CLINTON:
Well, if fighting for equal pay,

01:47.708 --> 01:50.578
paid leave,
and Planned Parenthood

01:50.611 --> 01:52.513
is playing the gender card,

01:52.546 --> 01:53.714
deal me in.

01:53.747 --> 01:55.283
(crowd cheering)

01:55.316 --> 01:56.517
NEWSCASTER:
Some congressional candidates

01:56.550 --> 01:59.153
have used the shutdown
to bring up many...

01:59.187 --> 02:00.421
(grunting)

02:00.454 --> 02:02.223
It's now 9:10 a.m.
and time to get an update

02:02.256 --> 02:04.358
on weather and traffic
in the area.

02:04.392 --> 02:07.495
Highs today are expected
to hit 72 degrees.

02:07.528 --> 02:08.862
It is currently 64 and...

02:08.896 --> 02:10.264
(turns off TV)

02:11.865 --> 02:14.202
(door opens)

02:14.235 --> 02:16.237
(door closes)

02:17.971 --> 02:21.642
(crunching)

02:24.878 --> 02:27.415
*

02:39.993 --> 02:41.195
Yes?

02:41.229 --> 02:42.830
Am I not patriotic enough
for you?

02:44.798 --> 02:46.767
Are you... not...
Because you wear one,

02:46.800 --> 02:48.569
and I don't-- am I
some Godless liberal?

02:48.602 --> 02:50.738
Uh, no, I just... just wear it.

02:50.771 --> 02:53.641
Why are the Republicans
trashing the U.S. Constitution?

02:53.674 --> 02:55.243
And why do they want to return

02:55.276 --> 02:56.577
to back-alley abortions?
Uh, uh, I don't know.

02:56.610 --> 02:57.945
Did you know that 42%

02:57.978 --> 03:00.481
of Denmark's energy
comes from wind power?

03:00.514 --> 03:01.882
Should I come back?
(door opening)

03:01.915 --> 03:04.218
(door closing)

03:04.252 --> 03:05.953
Uh, Ms. Healy?

03:05.986 --> 03:07.821
Uh, I'm Anthony Onofrio,
FBI criminal division.

03:07.855 --> 03:08.889
Do you have a minute?

03:08.922 --> 03:10.224
Does she have a choice?

03:10.258 --> 03:11.759
Are we living
in a fascist state now?

03:12.860 --> 03:14.495
She's a little intense.

03:14.528 --> 03:15.496
(sighs)

03:15.529 --> 03:16.897
I think it's
the shutdown.

03:16.930 --> 03:17.898
It's getting
to everyone.

03:17.931 --> 03:19.567
Yeah, FBI, too.

03:19.600 --> 03:22.703
So, uh,
this is about Dr. Daudier.

03:22.736 --> 03:24.505
I just have a few questions.

03:24.538 --> 03:27.875
Can you tell me what happened
yesterday in the ambulance?

03:29.943 --> 03:31.912
(splattering)
Yes, um...

03:31.945 --> 03:33.247
Have you seen the body?

03:33.281 --> 03:34.682
No. Photos.

03:36.617 --> 03:38.252
His head just...

03:38.286 --> 03:40.254
(explosion and splattering)
(gasping)

03:40.288 --> 03:41.855
...exploded.

03:41.889 --> 03:44.492
Did you hear a gunshot?

03:44.525 --> 03:45.993
No.

03:46.026 --> 03:49.930
One of the EMTs
said he heard a gunshot.

03:49.963 --> 03:51.499
No, I would have noticed that.

03:51.532 --> 03:53.334
And the driver,
was there anything

03:53.367 --> 03:54.902
unusual about the driver?

03:54.935 --> 03:56.637
What do you mean?

03:56.670 --> 03:58.372
It's just one
of our leads.

03:58.406 --> 04:00.874
You ever met
the driver before?

04:00.908 --> 04:02.810
I mean, I don't even know
who the driver is.

04:02.843 --> 04:04.278
Ali Wasem.

04:04.312 --> 04:05.579
He's a resident of Front Royal.

04:05.613 --> 04:08.816
Not on any of our watch lists.

04:08.849 --> 04:10.484
I don't think it's about that.

04:10.518 --> 04:11.852
About what?
Terrorism.

04:13.621 --> 04:16.557
Thank you for answering
my questions.
Of course.

04:16.590 --> 04:18.292
If you think of anything
else, just...
Thank you.

04:18.326 --> 04:19.893
Sure, yeah.

04:22.029 --> 04:23.597
LUKE:
A handsome guy.

04:23.631 --> 04:24.698
Uh-huh.

04:24.732 --> 04:25.699
He likes you.

04:25.733 --> 04:26.700
That's why all the questions

04:26.734 --> 04:27.968
about a dead body.

04:28.001 --> 04:29.570
(chuckles)
SCARLETT: Senator?

04:29.603 --> 04:30.771
Democratic caucus
in five minutes.

04:30.804 --> 04:32.973
On my way.

04:33.006 --> 04:35.476
It's the first caucus
after losing the majority.

04:35.509 --> 04:36.977
You going to be all right?
It's just the usual

04:37.010 --> 04:38.312
Democratic bloodletting.

04:38.346 --> 04:39.813
(loud munching)

04:41.482 --> 04:44.017
I something up with her?

04:44.051 --> 04:45.619
No. Why, what do you mean?

04:45.653 --> 04:47.721
She's a little intense
this morning.

04:47.755 --> 04:48.856
You two have a fight?

04:48.889 --> 04:49.990
Shut up.

04:50.023 --> 04:51.325
I think she's dieting.

04:51.359 --> 04:52.526
Hey, why don't
you head home?

04:52.560 --> 04:54.027
Get some rest,
come back tomorrow.

04:54.061 --> 04:55.729
I'm good,
I can work.
Okay.

04:55.763 --> 04:56.864
Well, then,
there's two constituents

04:56.897 --> 04:57.931
in the waiting room.

04:57.965 --> 04:59.767
Keep them happy.

05:01.569 --> 05:02.836
LAUREL:
These are really great, Annie.

05:02.870 --> 05:04.672
ANNIE:
Thanks, there's more on my blog.

05:04.705 --> 05:06.840
It's about raising money
for cancer research.

05:06.874 --> 05:09.109
We call it
Annie's 20/20 Vision.

05:09.142 --> 05:11.379
We visit 20
monuments in 20 days.

05:11.412 --> 05:13.681
ANNIE:
We've raised $43,000, so far.

05:13.714 --> 05:14.848
Wow.

05:14.882 --> 05:15.949
So you're looking

05:15.983 --> 05:17.451
for a donation
from our office.

05:17.485 --> 05:19.086
No, well, I mean...

05:19.119 --> 05:20.721
sure, that would always
be great, but...

05:20.754 --> 05:23.524
We're one monument short
of reaching our goal.

05:23.557 --> 05:25.593
The Lincoln Memorial,
it's closed.

05:25.626 --> 05:26.827
FATHER:
Because of the shutdown.

05:26.860 --> 05:27.961
Uh, we-we just need a picture

05:27.995 --> 05:29.096
inside in front of Lincoln

05:29.129 --> 05:31.365
to complete the 20.

05:31.399 --> 05:32.600
Have you talked
to the Park Service?

05:32.633 --> 05:34.402
Yes, they said no exceptions.

05:34.435 --> 05:36.570
I guess they have some history
with shutdowns.

05:36.604 --> 05:38.806
If they do it for us, they'll
have to do it for everyone.

05:38.839 --> 05:41.975
We just want to be
in there for a minute.

05:42.009 --> 05:43.844
Lincoln's my favorite president.

05:43.877 --> 05:45.779
She knows the whole
Gettysburg Address.

05:45.813 --> 05:47.548
Don't worry,
I won't do it for you.

05:47.581 --> 05:49.450
Okay.

05:49.483 --> 05:51.084
I'll talk to my brother.

05:51.118 --> 05:53.086
He's an expert at this stuff.

05:53.120 --> 05:56.757
(loud, indistinct conversations)

05:58.859 --> 06:01.795
Luke, you need to man up and
accept that this is your fault.

06:01.829 --> 06:02.930
You lost to Senator Spitz,

06:02.963 --> 06:04.898
You lost us the majority.

06:04.932 --> 06:07.401
Look, I understand
everyone's frustration,

06:07.435 --> 06:08.769
but nobody saw this coming.

06:08.802 --> 06:09.837
(loud, overlapping chatter)

06:09.870 --> 06:10.938
You're the whip.

06:10.971 --> 06:12.773
The job is not just counting
votes, you're supposed

06:12.806 --> 06:14.542
to keep members together.

06:14.575 --> 06:16.844
May I say something, please?

06:16.877 --> 06:17.945
(chattering quiets)

06:17.978 --> 06:21.181
I am delighted
to see the members

06:21.214 --> 06:24.552
of this caucus get angry.

06:24.585 --> 06:25.886
Finally.

06:25.919 --> 06:27.688
Unfortunately,
as usual,

06:27.721 --> 06:29.923
our anger is being
directed at ourselves.

06:29.957 --> 06:31.659
This is not the time
to blame Luke Healy,

06:31.692 --> 06:34.061
whose family,
may I remind you,

06:34.094 --> 06:35.896
has done so much
for this party.

06:35.929 --> 06:40.067
This is exactly
what the Republicans want.

06:40.100 --> 06:42.503
I say we table
a vote on leadership,

06:42.536 --> 06:44.638
and go back
out there and fight.

06:44.672 --> 06:46.707
(applause)

06:46.740 --> 06:48.542
Thanks, Ella.
This is a nightmare.

06:48.576 --> 06:49.843
Don't thank me.
What are you doing?

06:49.877 --> 06:51.512
What am I...

06:51.545 --> 06:52.913
To get the majority back,
what are you doing?

06:52.946 --> 06:53.947
They must have offered
Senator Spitz

06:53.981 --> 06:55.683
the moon to betray us.

06:55.716 --> 06:56.917
PAC money, influence,

06:56.950 --> 06:58.118
committee chairs...
all I know is,

06:58.151 --> 06:59.553
some Republican
was pushed aside

06:59.587 --> 07:00.988
to make room for him.
You'll find out who?

07:01.021 --> 07:02.590
Yes,
and offer that person the moon

07:02.623 --> 07:03.857
to flip to our side.

07:03.891 --> 07:05.192
It's musical chairs.

07:05.225 --> 07:06.994
Someone over there
is without a chair.

07:07.027 --> 07:08.529
I can defend you
for a little while, Luke,

07:08.562 --> 07:11.599
but at a certain point,
the mob needs blood.

07:11.632 --> 07:14.001
So if you have a plan,
do it fast.

07:15.569 --> 07:16.937
LAUREL:
They've been to monuments

07:16.970 --> 07:18.572
in all 50 states,
and now she's here

07:18.606 --> 07:19.773
to see
the Lincoln Memorial,

07:19.807 --> 07:20.874
but due to the shutdown,
it's closed.

07:20.908 --> 07:22.175
Listen, Laurel,

07:22.209 --> 07:23.577
you'll be hearing
a million stories

07:23.611 --> 07:24.712
of heartbreak
every day.

07:24.745 --> 07:25.779
You can't let
everyone in.

07:25.813 --> 07:26.980
Remember that opera singer

07:27.014 --> 07:28.582
I used to date?
How did you do that?

07:28.616 --> 07:30.551
We're suddenly talking
about you again.
She told me,

07:30.584 --> 07:32.486
when she had to
do a sad scene,

07:32.520 --> 07:33.754
she couldn't
get emotional,

07:33.787 --> 07:35.523
because her throat
would close up,

07:35.556 --> 07:37.057
and she couldn't sing.

07:37.090 --> 07:40.060
If she felt too much,
she couldn't do her job.

07:40.093 --> 07:41.128
So you're saying don't feel?

07:41.161 --> 07:43.497
No, I'm saying only feel

07:43.531 --> 07:44.765
if it makes you effective.

07:44.798 --> 07:46.800
God... politics.

07:49.102 --> 07:51.238
Are you still
in touch with, uh,

07:51.271 --> 07:53.173
Wheatus's legislative director?

07:53.206 --> 07:55.976
Gareth? Yeah, yeah,
he keeps calling.

07:56.009 --> 07:58.579
I think he feels bad
about blowing up the deal.

07:59.279 --> 08:01.615
I want you to come
to DoubleSpeak today.

08:01.649 --> 08:03.183
I'm on with Red.

08:03.216 --> 08:05.185
Talk to Gareth
in the greenroom.

08:05.218 --> 08:07.588
Let him apologize,
make him feel guilty.

08:07.621 --> 08:08.922
You want me to find out
which Republican

08:08.956 --> 08:11.491
was demoted to make room
for the Democrat?

08:12.960 --> 08:14.928
You know, for someone
who disdains politics,

08:14.962 --> 08:17.731
you don't seem
half-bad at it.

08:17.765 --> 08:19.299
Well, he's not going
to just tell me.

08:19.332 --> 08:20.601
I know.

08:20.634 --> 08:22.302
You want me to pimp myself out?

08:22.335 --> 08:23.737
No.

08:23.771 --> 08:24.938
Metaphorically.

08:24.972 --> 08:26.774
(scoffs)
Hey, he used you.

08:26.807 --> 08:28.075
He distracted you

08:28.108 --> 08:29.810
while Red stole
Senator Spitz from us,

08:29.843 --> 08:31.211
so use him back.

08:31.244 --> 08:34.081
Look... I need this.

08:34.114 --> 08:36.850
I'm in danger
of losing my job.

08:38.586 --> 08:40.688
...we are getting flooded...
The deficit has gone down.
Why won't you...?

08:40.721 --> 08:44.224
Senators, we're on the eve
of a historic election.

08:44.257 --> 08:46.193
The American people just want
you all to work together.

08:46.226 --> 08:48.629
Ronald Reagan and Tip O'Neil
were drinking buddies.

08:48.662 --> 08:49.963
What on God's good green earth
is the hold up?

08:49.997 --> 08:51.231
Senator Wheatus?

08:51.264 --> 08:53.166
Simple. The Democrat Party...

08:53.200 --> 08:54.467
It's Democratic.
Well, not lately.

08:54.501 --> 08:56.637
Great zinger, Senator.
Well, thank you.
I got a million more.

08:56.670 --> 08:58.906
LUKE: Why don't we speak
to what's right

08:58.939 --> 09:01.308
with our constituents
and the GOZ,
RED: Teeing them up,

09:01.341 --> 09:03.043
Party of Zingers.
and I'll just keep knocking
them out...

09:03.076 --> 09:04.578
LUKE: You know what this is?
It's a temper tantrum...

09:04.612 --> 09:06.113
You know, they say you can

09:06.146 --> 09:08.582
judge a person by how fast
they return a phone call.

09:08.616 --> 09:10.250
Really?
That's how this works?

09:10.283 --> 09:11.752
You take advantage of me...

09:11.785 --> 09:12.920
How did I take advantage of you?

09:12.953 --> 09:14.221
Oh, my God, seriously?

09:15.188 --> 09:16.724
"People are going hungry."

09:16.757 --> 09:18.125
Remember that little speech?

09:18.158 --> 09:19.927
All the time,
you were going behind my back

09:19.960 --> 09:21.929
to steal a Democratic senator.
I wasn't stealing anything.

09:21.962 --> 09:24.632
Red changed his mind, okay?

09:29.236 --> 09:30.871
Apology accepted.

09:30.904 --> 09:32.773
What?

09:32.806 --> 09:34.007
What apology?

09:34.041 --> 09:35.943
The apology
you're struggling with.

09:35.976 --> 09:37.745
RED:
Senator Spitz switched parties

09:37.778 --> 09:39.813
because he hated wasting
American taxpayers money.

09:39.847 --> 09:41.014
No, he switched parties
because the Republicans

09:41.048 --> 09:43.350
gave him a chairmanship
and PAC money.

09:43.383 --> 09:45.352
Is that what happened?

09:45.385 --> 09:46.620
(crunching)

09:46.654 --> 09:47.688
No comment.

09:47.721 --> 09:48.756
Okay.

09:48.789 --> 09:50.824
Are you going to Tax Prom?

09:50.858 --> 09:53.026
Am I... What?

09:53.060 --> 09:54.161
Going to Tax Prom.

09:54.194 --> 09:55.629
I have no idea what that is.

09:55.663 --> 09:58.666
It's a prom
run by tax lobbyists.

09:58.699 --> 10:00.100
Tax Prom.

10:00.133 --> 10:01.902
Hill staffers dress up,
get drunk,

10:01.935 --> 10:03.170
argue about Paul Krugman,

10:03.203 --> 10:04.304
vomit on the sidewalk.

10:04.337 --> 10:05.773
It's pretty fun.

10:05.806 --> 10:07.641
I can't tell
if you're being serious.

10:07.675 --> 10:09.643
I'm being serious.

10:09.677 --> 10:11.244
You want to go?

10:13.280 --> 10:16.349
Why are the Democrats
being so difficult?

10:16.383 --> 10:17.818
You know the cameras are off,
right?

10:17.851 --> 10:19.319
You and your socialist friends

10:19.352 --> 10:20.988
can end the pain right now.

10:21.021 --> 10:22.990
Just sit down and listen
to our offer.

10:23.023 --> 10:24.925
What offer?
Ah, ha, ha.

10:24.958 --> 10:26.126
Oh, no, no, no.

10:26.159 --> 10:28.328
Tortilla Nights,
tomorrow, 9:00 a.m.

10:28.361 --> 10:29.797
We'll lay it out.

10:29.830 --> 10:31.331
Well, it's got
to be good.

10:31.364 --> 10:32.833
Oh, it'll be good.

10:35.168 --> 10:36.804
What happened with
his legislative director?

10:36.837 --> 10:38.071
Did he say anything?

10:38.105 --> 10:39.707
No.
Hmm.

10:39.740 --> 10:41.675
But he asked me
to the Tax Prom.

10:41.709 --> 10:43.143
Attagirl.

10:43.176 --> 10:45.746
Remember... Annie.

10:45.779 --> 10:46.980
Lincoln Memorial.

10:47.014 --> 10:49.282
I'm on it.
Good.

10:50.851 --> 10:52.853
*

10:53.721 --> 10:55.823
MAN:
No, stop looking at the board.

10:55.856 --> 10:57.024
Boom.

10:57.057 --> 10:58.225
Lose.

10:58.258 --> 10:59.760
It's okay to go.

10:59.793 --> 11:01.328
Do-do-do-do-do-do.

11:01.361 --> 11:03.163
(sighs)

11:03.196 --> 11:04.732
Check.

11:04.765 --> 11:06.399
You should have castled sooner,
Michael.

11:07.334 --> 11:09.169
Ah.

11:09.202 --> 11:10.704
The King's Indian defense.

11:10.738 --> 11:13.373
(laughing)

11:13.406 --> 11:15.375
Nope, sorry.

11:15.408 --> 11:17.310
Checkmate.

11:17.344 --> 11:18.779
Try again.
(clicks tongue)

11:22.282 --> 11:24.684
Oscar,
you haven't moved a piece yet.

11:26.519 --> 11:29.356
You need to move a piece
so that I can move a piece.

11:29.389 --> 11:31.792
That's how...
that's how it works.

11:35.896 --> 11:37.197
Um...

11:37.230 --> 11:38.799
Okay, Oscar, I'm gonna...

11:38.832 --> 11:40.433
I'm gonna count down.

11:41.835 --> 11:43.771
Six, five,

11:43.804 --> 11:45.372
four...

11:45.405 --> 11:47.875
three...

11:49.342 --> 11:51.011
...two...

11:56.817 --> 11:58.118
911!

11:58.151 --> 12:00.053
Someone call 911!

12:00.087 --> 12:02.856
(siren wailing)

12:02.890 --> 12:05.025
(whirring)

12:05.058 --> 12:07.060
I think it might be

12:07.094 --> 12:09.062
a diffuse axonal
injury.

12:09.096 --> 12:10.898
Are you a doctor, sir?

12:10.931 --> 12:13.400
No, but I read a lot.

12:13.433 --> 12:15.769
OSCAR:
Aah! They're in my head!

12:15.803 --> 12:18.872
Make 'em stop!
Sir? Sir, I need you
to lie still.

12:18.906 --> 12:20.540
(screaming)
Distract him.

12:20.573 --> 12:24.144
They're inside me!
Help me!
Calm him down.

12:24.177 --> 12:26.880
(panting)
Uh, Oscar, uh, listen to me.

12:26.914 --> 12:28.548
Listen, um,
I had you in check.

12:28.581 --> 12:30.217
So don't think
that you can distract me.

12:30.250 --> 12:31.451
I know where
all the pieces were.

12:31.484 --> 12:34.822
That wasn't check.
Uh,

12:34.855 --> 12:37.157
you know it was.
King's pawn to D3.

12:37.190 --> 12:39.459
Bishop's pawn...
(panting) F6.

12:39.492 --> 12:41.094
No, but you
didn't move to F6.

12:41.128 --> 12:43.563
Yes, I did.
(chuckles) Oh, Gustav!

12:43.596 --> 12:46.433
Make 'em stop!

12:46.466 --> 12:47.567
Just a little bit longer.

12:47.600 --> 12:50.203
GUSTAV:
Okay, Oscar, queen's pawn

12:50.237 --> 12:51.238
to E4.

12:51.271 --> 12:53.340
They're inside my head!
Focus.

12:53.373 --> 12:56.176
Focus on the board.
Queen's pawn to E4.

12:56.209 --> 12:57.811
(strained):
Pawn...

12:57.845 --> 12:58.912
Which one? Which pawn?
(crying)

12:58.946 --> 12:59.913
Come on, Oscar.

12:59.947 --> 13:01.815
You really gonna
let me win?

13:01.849 --> 13:03.216
(Oscar groaning)

13:03.250 --> 13:04.517
(screaming)

13:04.551 --> 13:06.453
(boom)
(splashing)

13:10.891 --> 13:13.193
(gasping)

13:26.206 --> 13:29.142
Thanks for coming out
during the shutdown.

13:29.176 --> 13:30.878
(applause)
Yeah!

13:30.911 --> 13:33.346
We all need to do something,
right?

13:33.380 --> 13:35.883
It's been a great year
for tax policy.

13:35.916 --> 13:38.218
Two percent capital gain cuts.

13:38.251 --> 13:40.087
(cheering and applause)
Yeah!

13:40.120 --> 13:43.256
Dependent Care Tax Credit.

13:43.290 --> 13:47.194
That's right. Conforming
SECA Taxes for Professional

13:47.227 --> 13:49.997
Service Businesses. Yeah.

13:50.030 --> 13:52.332
And now it's time to celebrate.

13:52.365 --> 13:54.067
Are you ready?
(mild affirmation)

13:54.101 --> 13:57.604
Come on! Are you ready
for some major tax funk?!

13:57.637 --> 13:59.472
* Party people

13:59.506 --> 14:02.242
Yeah!
* Yeah

14:02.275 --> 14:04.511
* Tag Team music
in full effect *

14:04.544 --> 14:06.646
* That's me,
DC the Brain Supreme *

14:06.679 --> 14:09.516
* And my man Steve Roll'n
* Come on

14:09.549 --> 14:11.518
* We're kicking the flow

14:11.551 --> 14:14.454
* Oh, yeah, come on

14:14.487 --> 14:16.356
* Tag Team back again,
check its records *

14:16.389 --> 14:18.591
* Let's begin,
party on, party people *

14:18.625 --> 14:20.260
* Let me hear some noise,
DC's in the house... *

14:20.293 --> 14:22.662
Ma'am, can I
take your picture?

14:22.695 --> 14:25.232
Stacie? Oh, my God.

14:25.265 --> 14:27.267
What the hell
are you doing here?

14:27.300 --> 14:30.537
Last time I checked, you were
in California getting famous.
I was.

14:30.570 --> 14:32.539
I came back to make some money.
What about you?

14:32.572 --> 14:34.341
You had all those amazing photos
online.

14:34.374 --> 14:36.343
Thanks. I'm working for...

14:36.376 --> 14:38.278
Roll Call,
making some money, too.

14:38.311 --> 14:40.213
Can you believe it?
I'm turning into my mother.

14:40.247 --> 14:42.215
(laughs)
Hey,

14:42.249 --> 14:45.085
you know who I saw?
You won't believe it. Abby.

14:45.118 --> 14:46.519
Abby Summers? You're kidding.

14:46.553 --> 14:48.021
I thought she was
whitewater rafting

14:48.055 --> 14:49.556
in New Guinea.
In New Guinea. I know.

14:49.589 --> 14:52.659
You've been following her blog,
too? She's changed a lot.

14:52.692 --> 14:55.128
I mean a lot a lot.

14:55.162 --> 14:57.130
Come on.

14:57.164 --> 14:58.698
What, she's here?

14:58.731 --> 15:02.002
At the Tax Prom?

15:02.035 --> 15:03.703
Hey, Abby,
look who I found.

15:03.736 --> 15:05.638
Laurel, how are you?

15:05.672 --> 15:07.975
Abby, wow.

15:08.008 --> 15:09.943
Look at you.
I know.
I was saying

15:09.977 --> 15:12.112
the same thing.
I don't usually come
to events like this,

15:12.145 --> 15:14.081
but work sent me.
Tell her

15:14.114 --> 15:15.048
where work is.

15:15.082 --> 15:16.383
Help America Rise Again.

15:17.550 --> 15:19.086
Really?

15:19.119 --> 15:21.454
Isn't that the...
right wing group?

15:21.488 --> 15:24.191
If by "right wing"
you mean we're right, then...

15:24.224 --> 15:26.193
yep.
(chuckles)

15:26.226 --> 15:30.097
Look, Laurel, I know
you're into Democratic politics,

15:30.130 --> 15:31.464
but you have to read
the literature.

15:31.498 --> 15:33.366
It makes a lot of sense.

15:33.400 --> 15:35.235
I'll send you some tapes.
Yes, she's
sending me

15:35.268 --> 15:36.469
some, too.

15:36.503 --> 15:38.471
Abby, uh, on your blog

15:38.505 --> 15:40.473
you said you won
the Genius Grant last month

15:40.507 --> 15:41.741
to-to write your novel.

15:41.774 --> 15:44.077
Yeah, I know.
But why write a novel

15:44.111 --> 15:46.079
when the country
is going down the drain?

15:46.113 --> 15:48.615
When the American Dream
is under attack.

15:48.648 --> 15:51.084
Have you listened to Trump?
(phone ringing)

15:51.118 --> 15:53.653
Ooh. I need to grab this.

15:53.686 --> 15:56.056
It's my boss.

15:58.725 --> 16:00.393
Her parents were Republicans,
but I always thought

16:00.427 --> 16:01.328
she had rebelled
against them.

16:03.496 --> 16:05.265
Stacie, I have to go.
I'm meeting someone.

16:05.298 --> 16:08.668
But we should have Abby
over sometime. Girls' night.

16:08.701 --> 16:10.670
Yeah, get her drunk.
A sort of reverse intervention.

16:10.703 --> 16:12.539
So, you'll talk to her?
Sure.

16:12.572 --> 16:15.008
Good to have you back,
Laurel.

16:15.042 --> 16:17.010
* I'm amazing, outstanding,
demanding... *

16:17.044 --> 16:19.279
There you are.

16:19.312 --> 16:21.281
Here I am.
You look great.

16:21.314 --> 16:22.549
Thank you.

16:22.582 --> 16:24.151
I feel like an idiot.
You don't look

16:24.184 --> 16:25.185
like an idiot.

16:25.218 --> 16:26.519
You don't either.

16:26.553 --> 16:27.787
You want to dance?

16:27.820 --> 16:30.390
No, I want a drink.

16:39.099 --> 16:41.301
Exploding head syndrome
is very real and very common,

16:41.334 --> 16:45.438
but it's not
about an actual exploding head.

16:45.472 --> 16:46.739
Infrasound can be dangerous
to the body,

16:46.773 --> 16:49.076
and there's even been talk
of sonic weapons.

16:49.109 --> 16:54.214
But even at 240 decibels,
the head could never explode.

16:54.247 --> 16:57.284
Mm...
(click)

16:58.618 --> 17:02.322
*

17:16.603 --> 17:18.205
(dance music playing)
LAUREL:
Have you noticed no one

17:18.238 --> 17:19.572
in D.C. drinks anymore?

17:19.606 --> 17:21.574
Every administration's
different.

17:21.608 --> 17:23.710
During the Bushes,
people went to bed at 9:00.

17:23.743 --> 17:25.578
The Clintons, 2:00
in the morning.

17:25.612 --> 17:28.081
No. No, things are changing.

17:28.115 --> 17:31.084
My friend became
a political fanatic overnight.

17:31.118 --> 17:32.619
Last week,
she was writing a novel.

17:32.652 --> 17:35.122
This week, she's raving
about Trump.

17:35.155 --> 17:38.125
And why do I think if she
was raving about Hillary

17:38.158 --> 17:40.127
she wouldn't be
quite so fanatic?

17:40.160 --> 17:43.396
You think I'm more partisan
than you, don't I?

17:43.430 --> 17:45.098
I mean "don't-don't you?"

17:45.132 --> 17:46.766
I think you and a lot
of Democrats are tolerant

17:46.799 --> 17:48.335
of everything but Republicans.

17:48.368 --> 17:49.636
That's because a lot
of Republicans

17:49.669 --> 17:51.238
are just intolerant.

17:51.271 --> 17:52.472
Am I intolerant?

17:52.505 --> 17:54.474
You're... cynical.

17:54.507 --> 17:57.777
Ooh.
But I don't... Everybody is.

17:57.810 --> 18:01.381
Do you think people in this town
were ever idealistic?

18:01.414 --> 18:02.882
Yeah. Reagan.

18:02.915 --> 18:04.351
Oh, God, you're kidding.

18:04.384 --> 18:05.652
I knew that was
gonna piss you off.

18:05.685 --> 18:07.520
I think people come here and...

18:07.554 --> 18:10.190
they're idealists and then
they get it beaten out of them.

18:10.223 --> 18:12.192
Just a little bit every day.

18:12.225 --> 18:13.693
And then they're just...

18:13.726 --> 18:15.628
shells of themselves.
But not the people

18:15.662 --> 18:17.797
in L.A., right? I mean,
that's where we find the...

18:17.830 --> 18:19.566
true idealists.

18:19.599 --> 18:21.568
We don't really talk,
do we? We just...
(chuckles)

18:21.601 --> 18:22.635
contradict each other.

18:22.669 --> 18:25.172
(phone ringing)

18:28.175 --> 18:30.143
I'm sorry. I have to take this.

18:30.177 --> 18:32.812
Don't leave.

18:32.845 --> 18:36.283
Yes, Senator. Hold on.

18:36.316 --> 18:38.618
Oh, he's not gonna be
very happy about that, sir.

18:38.651 --> 18:41.154
He already thinks
Spitz took his chair.

18:41.188 --> 18:44.624
Well, we don't have
anything to give.

18:44.657 --> 18:47.660
No, yeah, no problem.
I'll make the call.

18:47.694 --> 18:49.696
Excuse me.

18:58.738 --> 19:00.907
(beeping)

19:00.940 --> 19:03.410
(line ringing)

19:03.443 --> 19:06.646
WOMAN (recorded):
This is the Senate offices
of Senator Michael Barneki.

19:06.679 --> 19:08.848
We're not in right now,
but you can leave a message...

19:08.881 --> 19:10.717
(phone beeps off)

19:12.819 --> 19:15.522
Hey.

19:15.555 --> 19:18.358
He used you.

19:20.760 --> 19:22.762
(beeps)

19:23.963 --> 19:25.465
(phone rings)
LUKE: Yeah.

19:25.498 --> 19:26.699
Senator Barneki.

19:26.733 --> 19:29.436
And this is from Wheatus's man?

19:29.469 --> 19:30.737
Yep.

19:30.770 --> 19:32.405
That makes sense.
Barneki is a moderate,

19:32.439 --> 19:35.275
and Red hates him.
Did Gareth tell you this?

19:35.308 --> 19:38.345
No, he was calling Barneki
to do damage control.

19:38.378 --> 19:40.213
Good. We'll get right on it.

19:40.247 --> 19:41.814
Oh, hey, and I'm helping
your cancer girl.

19:41.848 --> 19:43.883
My "cancer girl"?

19:43.916 --> 19:45.818
I know. She's a real human being
with a real name.

19:45.852 --> 19:47.654
Give me a break. Good job.

19:48.888 --> 19:50.323
(phone beeps off)

19:51.524 --> 19:53.493
* This is how we do it

19:53.526 --> 19:55.295
* It's Friday night

19:55.328 --> 19:56.763
* And I feel all right
Let's dance.

19:56.796 --> 19:59.366
Sure, why not.
* The party's here

19:59.399 --> 20:01.701
* On the West Side,
so I reach for my 40 *

20:01.734 --> 20:03.703
* And I turn it up,
designated driver *

20:03.736 --> 20:05.572
* Take the keys to my truck

20:05.605 --> 20:07.574
* Hit the shore
'cause I'm faded *

20:07.607 --> 20:10.443
* Honeys in the street say,
"Monty, yo, we made it" *

20:10.477 --> 20:11.844
* It feels so good

20:11.878 --> 20:14.514
* In my hood tonight...

20:17.049 --> 20:19.018
Hi, I'm Laurel.

20:19.051 --> 20:20.887
I believe you're next.

20:20.920 --> 20:22.922
Have a seat.

20:24.524 --> 20:27.494
How may I help you, Rochelle...

20:27.527 --> 20:29.896
Daudier?

20:29.929 --> 20:32.532
He was my father.

20:32.565 --> 20:35.034
I'm so sorry.

20:35.067 --> 20:36.403
You were with him

20:36.436 --> 20:37.870
in the ambulance?

20:37.904 --> 20:39.672
Yes.

20:39.706 --> 20:42.342
Can you tell me what happened?
They won't release the body,

20:42.375 --> 20:44.877
and no one's saying anything.
It's, uh...
it's sort of hard to...

20:44.911 --> 20:48.415
The autopsy said he died
of tepefactisque sanguinem.

20:48.448 --> 20:49.949
Overheated blood.

20:49.982 --> 20:52.885
I'm not sure I understand.
That's not a real thing.

20:52.919 --> 20:55.555
I'm a resident at Mount Vernon,
and there is nothing

20:55.588 --> 21:00.059
in the blood that has enough
power to open a cranial gap.

21:00.092 --> 21:03.262
And that's what happened, right?

21:04.664 --> 21:07.300
I really think
you should talk to the police.

21:07.334 --> 21:10.603
Ms. Healy, I work in an E.R.

21:10.637 --> 21:12.972
Anything you have to say,

21:13.005 --> 21:14.507
I can take it.

21:14.541 --> 21:16.876
His head exploded?

21:18.378 --> 21:20.313
Was he conscious?

21:20.347 --> 21:22.682
Did he say anything?

21:23.683 --> 21:26.018
What?

21:27.354 --> 21:31.324
He said they were
inside him.

21:31.358 --> 21:32.925
(clears throat)

21:32.959 --> 21:35.027
I, um...

21:37.530 --> 21:41.033
I have to show you something.
(sniffles)

21:41.067 --> 21:44.504
This is
a parasagittal scan

21:44.537 --> 21:46.506
of a healthy
cranial cavity.

21:46.539 --> 21:48.908
This is what a brain
should look like.

21:48.941 --> 21:50.910
A man was brought into the E.R.
yesterday.

21:50.943 --> 21:54.614
He collapsed in the park,
complaining of severe headaches.

21:54.647 --> 21:56.816
A CAT scan was performed.

21:56.849 --> 21:59.652
What are those?

21:59.686 --> 22:01.388
I don't know.

22:01.421 --> 22:02.889
The nurse thought

22:02.922 --> 22:04.924
there was something wrong
with the equipment.

22:04.957 --> 22:07.660
We can sometimes get
image artifacts

22:07.694 --> 22:09.462
related to normal
wear and tear.

22:09.496 --> 22:12.665
So she performed
another CAT scan.

22:14.166 --> 22:15.402
They're still there.

22:15.435 --> 22:17.537
Yes, but there's
something weird.

22:17.570 --> 22:20.373
What?
They moved.

22:23.543 --> 22:26.913
What does this have to do
with your father?

22:26.946 --> 22:30.049
This man's head exploded, too.

22:36.756 --> 22:37.724
Good morning.

22:37.757 --> 22:38.958
Good morning, gentlemen.

22:38.991 --> 22:40.693
What a great day.
Hey.

22:40.727 --> 22:41.928
Where are the
Bloody Marys, Red?

22:41.961 --> 22:44.096
I'm not drinking
but, uh, feel free.

22:44.130 --> 22:45.565
Quite a change for you.

22:45.598 --> 22:46.633
Turning a new leaf.

22:46.666 --> 22:47.900
Woke up one morning

22:47.934 --> 22:50.570
and realized my body
was a temple.

22:50.603 --> 22:53.540
Now wheat germ shakes,
best thing for you.

22:53.573 --> 22:56.443
Read this book, Forever Juice.

22:56.476 --> 22:58.110
I'll send you copies.

22:58.144 --> 22:59.779
What's the offer, Red?

23:00.780 --> 23:01.914
Well...

23:01.948 --> 23:04.050
we want the shutdown to end.

23:04.083 --> 23:06.419
There's... there's
too much pain.

23:06.453 --> 23:07.454
Agreed.

23:07.487 --> 23:08.788
What's the offer?

23:08.821 --> 23:12.725
Commerce, education and energy.

23:14.761 --> 23:15.962
What about them?

23:15.995 --> 23:17.964
Well, they're wasteful,

23:17.997 --> 23:19.966
bloated bureaucracies

23:19.999 --> 23:22.535
that hamper the free market.

23:22.569 --> 23:26.539
We'll agree to a budget deal
if you agree to cut them.

23:26.573 --> 23:28.875
(Luke laughs)
(laughs): Cut... Wh...?

23:31.744 --> 23:32.845
Are you serious?

23:32.879 --> 23:34.614
It's the best we can do.

23:34.647 --> 23:36.015
You're insane.

23:36.048 --> 23:38.117
On the contrary.

23:38.150 --> 23:40.553
I'm the sanest man in this room.

23:40.587 --> 23:41.721
I can also

23:41.754 --> 23:43.456
bench-press more
than anyone here.

23:43.490 --> 23:44.824
(laughs)

23:44.857 --> 23:46.859
(slurps loudly)

23:46.893 --> 23:49.696
They have completely
gone off the deep end.

23:49.729 --> 23:50.863
Yup.

23:50.897 --> 23:52.098
We can use it.

23:52.131 --> 23:54.133
(camera shutter clicking
continuously)

23:56.903 --> 23:58.638
(door closes)

24:04.944 --> 24:07.480
(camera shutter continues
clicking)

24:17.824 --> 24:20.226
*

24:38.811 --> 24:40.880
*

24:55.662 --> 24:57.530
(quietly):
Uh-oh.

24:57.564 --> 24:59.966
(phones ringing)

24:59.999 --> 25:02.635
Grace, what's overheated blood?

25:02.669 --> 25:05.037
MAN:
I have no idea.

25:05.071 --> 25:06.706
Grace?

25:08.841 --> 25:10.042
She's been furloughed.

25:10.076 --> 25:11.678
The government shutdown.

25:11.711 --> 25:13.946
I'm your temp, Butch.
Oh.

25:13.980 --> 25:15.815
I thought Public Safety
was exempted.

25:15.848 --> 25:16.883
You're exempted.

25:16.916 --> 25:18.284
We're non-essential personnel.

25:18.317 --> 25:19.686
By the way,
there's someone here

25:19.719 --> 25:20.953
to see you.
I think she said

25:20.987 --> 25:22.088
her name was Laurel.

25:22.121 --> 25:23.823
Healy?
Could be.

25:23.856 --> 25:25.558
Do you want me to ask?

25:25.592 --> 25:27.960
Uh, no,
just-just give me a second.

25:41.608 --> 25:42.675
Ms. Healy.

25:42.709 --> 25:44.577
Hi, uh, what a surprise.

25:44.611 --> 25:45.978
I'm sorry to just drop by,

25:46.012 --> 25:47.580
but the switchboard wasn't
letting me through.

25:47.614 --> 25:49.081
Non-essential personnel.

25:49.115 --> 25:51.183
Thank you, Grace... Bruce.

25:51.217 --> 25:53.853
Butch.

25:53.886 --> 25:55.254
(chuckles)

25:55.287 --> 25:57.089
Oh, no, that's okay.

25:57.123 --> 25:59.692
I have to get back to work
anyway, but I have something.

25:59.726 --> 26:01.694
You said to call
if I had something.

26:01.728 --> 26:03.095
Yeah.

26:03.129 --> 26:05.197
Someone else died in the
same way as Dr. Daudier.

26:05.231 --> 26:07.600
Really?
In a CAT scan machine
at Mount Vernon Hospital.

26:07.634 --> 26:09.602
How do you know this?
Daudier's daughter

26:09.636 --> 26:11.137
is a resident there,
Rochelle Daudier.

26:11.170 --> 26:12.271
I would talk to her.

26:12.304 --> 26:13.272
Yeah, thanks, I will.

26:13.305 --> 26:15.141
Uh, Rochelle?
Yes.

26:15.174 --> 26:17.744
And... that's it.

26:17.777 --> 26:19.278
With the switchboard,

26:19.311 --> 26:23.015
if you have any more trouble,
here's my cell number.

26:23.049 --> 26:25.284
LUKE (on TV):
The single most important job
a senator can do

26:25.317 --> 26:27.153
is take care
of his constituents.
Thank you.

26:27.186 --> 26:28.621
Sometimes they call or e-mail.

26:28.655 --> 26:30.790
Annie was a walk-in.

26:30.823 --> 26:32.659
You okay?
Yeah, yeah, thanks.

26:32.692 --> 26:34.026
All she wanted to do
was take a picture

26:34.060 --> 26:35.828
at the Lincoln Memorial
before she died,

26:35.862 --> 26:36.829
that's all.

26:36.863 --> 26:38.030
Oh, come on.

26:38.064 --> 26:39.031
But the Republicans
have prevented

26:39.065 --> 26:40.032
this courageous young lady

26:40.066 --> 26:41.801
from fulfilling that wish.

26:41.834 --> 26:43.102
MONARCH:
Social media has blown up

26:43.135 --> 26:44.937
with support
for "Shutdown Annie."

26:44.971 --> 26:46.806
That wasn't the point,
so you could get some

26:46.839 --> 26:48.040
political advantage
out of her.

26:48.074 --> 26:49.108
Well, that wasn't
your point.

26:49.141 --> 26:50.209
Do you think
the Republicans

26:50.242 --> 26:51.310
would go any
easier on us?

26:51.343 --> 26:52.645
Luke.

26:52.679 --> 26:54.213
Scarlett, can you
give us a minute?

26:57.750 --> 26:59.986
I brought her to you
so you could help her,

27:00.019 --> 27:01.187
not help yourself.
The fact that

27:01.220 --> 27:02.321
I'm using someone politically

27:02.354 --> 27:03.355
doesn't mean I don't care.

27:03.389 --> 27:05.257
I do care.

27:05.291 --> 27:08.160
I care enough that I don't
just want to win this for Mary.

27:08.194 --> 27:09.261
I want to win this...
Wait, who's Mary?

27:09.295 --> 27:11.130
Whatever her name is.

27:11.163 --> 27:12.264
Annie.

27:12.298 --> 27:13.432
Her name is Annie.

27:13.465 --> 27:15.401
I... I lost my cadence there.

27:15.434 --> 27:17.336
I want to win it for all

27:17.369 --> 27:19.038
Annies.
It's not either or.

27:19.071 --> 27:20.139
It's the language
of politics

27:20.172 --> 27:21.808
and I'll tell you right now,

27:21.841 --> 27:23.175
Red Wheatus is going insane

27:23.209 --> 27:24.410
and trying to figure
how to get Annie

27:24.443 --> 27:26.112
into the Washington Memorial

27:26.145 --> 27:27.213
with a photo op.

27:27.246 --> 27:29.248
That is being effective.

27:30.449 --> 27:32.284
I love you.
MISTY: This can, of course,

27:32.318 --> 27:34.020
be seen for what it is,

27:34.053 --> 27:36.422
a cynical ploy by the Democrats.

27:36.455 --> 27:37.890
Then again, that little girl

27:37.924 --> 27:39.859
and her story,
will undoubtedly

27:39.892 --> 27:41.794
touch many hearts.

27:41.828 --> 27:43.262
We need to neutralize
this thing fast.

27:43.295 --> 27:45.131
Get me everything you can
on that girl.

27:45.164 --> 27:46.833
Turn it into a positive, sir.

27:46.866 --> 27:49.235
Take her
to the Lincoln Memorial.

27:49.268 --> 27:51.771
That's the old way.
No, no, no, no, no, no.

27:51.804 --> 27:55.808
We need to show the Democrats
that we mean business.

27:56.809 --> 27:58.778
They bring Cancer Girl.

27:58.811 --> 28:00.446
We bring a knife.

28:00.479 --> 28:03.049
You get me that knife.

28:03.082 --> 28:04.383
(laughs)
You were falling down,

28:04.416 --> 28:05.718
and we tried to carry you.
No.

28:05.752 --> 28:07.219
That was not me.
That was Abby.

28:07.253 --> 28:08.821
No, it was you. Abby,
get over here.
Well, I did.
I left word for him...

28:08.855 --> 28:10.022
Defend your honor.

28:10.056 --> 28:12.391
I left word for you Thursday,
but I have not heard back.

28:12.424 --> 28:15.261
What happened to the clog
dancing documentary anyway?

28:15.294 --> 28:17.830
I couldn't get the money
to finish it.
God, that was fun.

28:17.864 --> 28:19.832
I thought there wouldn't be
a frame in focus,

28:19.866 --> 28:21.033
the way you were drinking.

28:21.067 --> 28:22.835
ABBY:
Will do, sir. Okay.

28:22.869 --> 28:25.004
Are you gonna
say something?

28:25.037 --> 28:26.238
ABBY:
Uh-huh. Okay, sir. Bye-bye.

28:26.272 --> 28:27.406
Yeah, if you are.

28:27.439 --> 28:29.909
Sorry. Work.

28:29.942 --> 28:32.144
No problem. Red or white?

28:32.178 --> 28:34.380
Oh. I'm okay. No wine for me.

28:34.413 --> 28:37.884
I'm on a cleanse.
You guys should really try it.

28:37.917 --> 28:39.886
Wheatgrass and beets.

28:39.919 --> 28:41.854
It's from this book,
Forever Juice.

28:41.888 --> 28:43.322
It's amazing.

28:43.355 --> 28:45.057
I thought Laurel was the
one out in California,

28:45.091 --> 28:46.926
not you.
Hey,

28:46.959 --> 28:49.328
did you guys read that
Wall Street Journal editorial

28:49.361 --> 28:51.998
this morning about the shutdown?
(laughs)

28:52.031 --> 28:55.301
Devastating
takedown.

28:55.334 --> 28:57.403
It was hilarious.
(chuckles)
LAUREL:
Yeah.

28:57.436 --> 29:00.139
Abby, why'd you give up
your Genius Grant?

29:00.172 --> 29:01.874
I would've killed
for one of those.

29:01.908 --> 29:03.876
Ugh, I don't know.
I read the novel.

29:03.910 --> 29:05.778
I didn't think it was very good.

29:05.812 --> 29:07.379
And I needed money.

29:07.413 --> 29:10.116
And the world
is so out of control.

29:10.149 --> 29:11.818
Yeah, but Help
America Rise?

29:11.851 --> 29:13.752
"Again."

29:14.921 --> 29:16.455
They are trying
to turn things around.

29:16.488 --> 29:18.124
Where is this coming from?

29:18.157 --> 29:19.291
(scoffs)

29:19.325 --> 29:21.127
I really don't like

29:21.160 --> 29:23.262
the way Democrats always treat
political differences

29:23.295 --> 29:25.932
like the opposition
has to be insane.

29:25.965 --> 29:27.533
Yeah, but giving up
your Genius Grant--

29:27.566 --> 29:29.936
I mean, it-it's just...
it's such a weird change.

29:29.969 --> 29:31.938
Why? You're the one
who's back in D.C.

29:31.971 --> 29:33.572
working for her brother.

29:33.605 --> 29:35.507
You're the one
who hasn't completed a single

29:35.541 --> 29:37.543
documentary since college.
Laurel's just
saying that...

29:37.576 --> 29:39.879
No, I know what she's saying,

29:39.912 --> 29:41.881
but I've always had
to fend for myself.

29:41.914 --> 29:43.482
No family money
to rely on.

29:43.515 --> 29:45.985
No senator brother
giving me a job.

29:46.018 --> 29:47.219
And what is
the problem

29:47.253 --> 29:50.456
with me taking responsibility
for my life?

29:50.489 --> 29:55.327
I don't want to be 40 years old
and looking back on my life...

29:56.328 --> 29:58.831
Abby...

29:58.865 --> 30:00.499
what's wrong?

30:01.533 --> 30:04.536
I have to get home. Sorry.

30:06.939 --> 30:08.908
(door opens, closes)

30:08.941 --> 30:10.542
MAN:
I've been a Republican
my whole life.

30:10.576 --> 30:12.945
LUKE: It's a game
of musical chairs, Senator,

30:12.979 --> 30:14.280
and you just
lost your chair.

30:14.313 --> 30:16.949
It's not the same party
anymore, Senator.

30:16.983 --> 30:19.185
Our two sides used
to work together. Like...

30:19.218 --> 30:21.620
ALL:
Ronald Reagan and Tip O'Neill.

30:21.653 --> 30:24.056
They were drinking buddies.
But look at you here. I mean,
look at these offices.

30:24.090 --> 30:27.459
You come to us, and you'll get
the best office on the floor.

30:28.494 --> 30:30.462
What else?

30:30.496 --> 30:32.131
You can have the gavel.

30:32.164 --> 30:34.266
And $12 million
in PAC money.

30:34.300 --> 30:36.335
And who do you think
will be president?

30:36.368 --> 30:38.404
ELLA:
Or you can stay
a Republican,

30:38.437 --> 30:41.407
and Red will run someone
against you from the right.

30:41.440 --> 30:44.543
That's what happens
to moderates now. You know that.

30:44.576 --> 30:46.078
(sighs)

30:46.112 --> 30:47.880
LUKE:
We did it!

30:47.914 --> 30:49.882
Laurel, we flipped him!

30:49.916 --> 30:51.884
Your information was good!

30:51.918 --> 30:54.253
Laurel isn't here, Senator.
Is everything all right?

30:54.286 --> 30:57.223
It sure is. We turned Barneki.
He's crossing the aisle.

30:57.256 --> 30:59.658
That's great.
We'll have the majority again.
Damn right.

30:59.691 --> 31:01.527
Got to love this game.

31:07.266 --> 31:09.435
What are you doing?

31:13.705 --> 31:15.541
It was great.

31:15.574 --> 31:17.409
He just crumbled.

31:17.443 --> 31:19.178
Did you tell him
what happened to moderates?

31:19.211 --> 31:22.148
Yeah. We have a press conference
tomorrow morning to announce it.

31:22.181 --> 31:24.450
I can't wait
to see the Republican faces.

31:24.483 --> 31:27.053
(chuckles)

31:31.357 --> 31:32.658
You all right?

31:32.691 --> 31:34.326
Yeah.
Mmm?

31:34.360 --> 31:37.229
Mmm. Kiss me.

31:40.632 --> 31:43.602
Mmm. Um,

31:43.635 --> 31:46.672
Scarlett, am I hurting you or...
No,

31:46.705 --> 31:48.674
more. It feels so good.

31:48.707 --> 31:51.243
So good. Here.

31:55.247 --> 31:58.417
Okay. We really don't need
to be doing this.

31:58.450 --> 32:01.420
No, I want to. Look, watch.

32:01.453 --> 32:04.390
(exhales)
See?

32:04.423 --> 32:07.526
Doesn't that feel good?

32:07.559 --> 32:09.261
Mmm, baby, how's that?

32:09.295 --> 32:11.663
(gags)

32:13.199 --> 32:14.967
Laurel talked to you,
didn't she?

32:15.001 --> 32:17.303
What?
My sister talked to you.

32:17.336 --> 32:18.504
No.

32:18.537 --> 32:20.239
She made you feel guilty.

32:20.272 --> 32:21.640
She talked to you about my wife.

32:21.673 --> 32:23.976
I want to pleasure you.
What?

32:24.010 --> 32:25.644
(scoffs)
Wait.

32:25.677 --> 32:27.546
I want you now.

32:32.684 --> 32:34.653
(upbeat fiddle music playing)

32:34.686 --> 32:36.155
(rhythmic clapping)

32:36.188 --> 32:37.523
(whooping, cheering)

32:37.556 --> 32:39.658
WOMAN:
Go, Abby!

32:39.691 --> 32:42.161
(music and clapping continue
on video)

32:46.298 --> 32:49.401
(phone beeps,
line ringing)

32:49.435 --> 32:51.470
ABBY:
Hi, this is Abby.
Leave me a voice mail.

32:51.503 --> 32:53.505
(beeps)

32:55.641 --> 32:59.011
Call me, Abby. Um...

32:59.045 --> 33:01.013
I think I need to apologize.

33:01.047 --> 33:02.414
(knocking)

33:02.448 --> 33:04.183
It's Laurel.

33:04.216 --> 33:05.451
(phone beeps off)

33:05.484 --> 33:07.653
(knocking)

33:09.321 --> 33:11.290
What did you say to Scarlett?

33:11.323 --> 33:12.624
What did... About what?

33:12.658 --> 33:14.493
About Scarlett... being with me.

33:14.526 --> 33:17.329
Being with you? Oh, is that
what they call infidelity now?

33:17.363 --> 33:18.730
What did you say, Laurel?

33:18.764 --> 33:20.332
I didn't say anything.
Why would I?

33:20.366 --> 33:21.700
Because you're my sister
and you like to meddle.

33:21.733 --> 33:23.702
Luke. I have a life.

33:23.735 --> 33:25.771
It's my life.
It consumes my time.

33:25.804 --> 33:28.507
Yes, and yet you always seem to
have time to criticize my life.

33:28.540 --> 33:29.808
When have I ever
criticized?

33:29.841 --> 33:31.410
High school. Tammy Bixby.

33:31.443 --> 33:33.145
Oh, my God,
are you talking about Pixie?

33:33.179 --> 33:34.680
Yes, I criticized you

33:34.713 --> 33:36.382
because Pixie
was sleeping

33:36.415 --> 33:38.350
with every guy in school,
and I'm...

33:38.384 --> 33:40.286
Oh, you know what,

33:40.319 --> 33:41.687
I'm done
being assaulted tonight.

33:41.720 --> 33:43.222
Can I just go to bed?

33:43.255 --> 33:46.092
Just leave Scarlett alone, okay?

33:47.326 --> 33:49.095
Wait a minute.

33:49.128 --> 33:50.729
Why do you think
I talked to Scarlett?

33:52.631 --> 33:54.400
Oh, my God,
you're sleeping with her again.

33:54.433 --> 33:56.435
No, I wasn't.
Clearly, I wasn't.

33:56.468 --> 33:58.437
Oh, because
she didn't want to?

33:58.470 --> 33:59.838
No.

33:59.871 --> 34:01.273
Look, I'm-I'm going now.

34:01.307 --> 34:02.608
Luke, you're married.

34:02.641 --> 34:03.842
Germaine loves you.
Good night.

34:03.875 --> 34:05.611
This was fun.

34:05.644 --> 34:08.514
MISTY:
The 12-year-old has since been
dubbed Shutdown Annie.

34:08.547 --> 34:11.617
But rumors surfaced earlier
today of her father's classes

34:11.650 --> 34:13.585
at UDC where he has taught

34:13.619 --> 34:15.854
that Abraham Lincoln was,
in fact, gay.

34:15.887 --> 34:17.489
(laughing)

34:17.523 --> 34:20.859
This is the rubbish we teach...
Gareth, get in here.

34:20.892 --> 34:22.761
This is you.
(laughs)

34:22.794 --> 34:24.530
LUKE:
Oh, my God.

34:24.563 --> 34:26.532
They think Lincoln was gay?
That has
nothing to do

34:26.565 --> 34:28.234
with wanting to get in
to see the monument.

34:28.267 --> 34:30.136
MONARCH:
According to neighbors,
Mr. Henry Leafton

34:30.169 --> 34:32.138
and his daughter
sued the school district

34:32.171 --> 34:34.506
over the use of the pledge
of allegiance in her class.

34:34.540 --> 34:37.209
Oh, good, an atheist, too.
Sure, why not?

34:37.243 --> 34:38.510
MISTY:
...no reaction
from the Democrats yet

34:38.544 --> 34:40.512
about Atheist Annie,

34:40.546 --> 34:43.215
but some have wondered why they
are continuing to play political

34:43.249 --> 34:44.783
games instead of sitting down
with the Republicans.

34:44.816 --> 34:46.518
Bring it here.

34:46.552 --> 34:48.120
I can't help but wonder
how this is going to play...

34:48.154 --> 34:49.655
You gave me the knife, buddy,

34:49.688 --> 34:52.391
and I gutted them
from belly to chin.

34:52.424 --> 34:53.959
Yes.

34:53.992 --> 34:56.262
BARNEKI: ...it's fairly obvious
as to why that is.
All right, here it comes.

34:56.295 --> 34:57.696
Mm-hmm.
The coup de grâce.

34:57.729 --> 34:59.165
Senator Healy offered me
anything I wanted

34:59.198 --> 35:00.399
to cross the aisle--

35:00.432 --> 35:02.801
appointments, PAC money,
even the gavel.

35:02.834 --> 35:04.536
He needs to stop
using the shutdown

35:04.570 --> 35:06.305
to play games,
and make no mistake...

35:06.338 --> 35:10.142
She swallowed it,
hook, line and sinker.

35:10.176 --> 35:12.178
Oh...
(grunts)

35:12.211 --> 35:13.612
Yeah. (laughs)

35:13.645 --> 35:15.214
(laughing)

35:15.247 --> 35:17.249
...appointments, PAC money,
even the gavel...

35:17.283 --> 35:19.251
Wait, you said
he called Barneki.

35:19.285 --> 35:20.619
Barneki was the odd man out.

35:20.652 --> 35:22.888
He did. I saw him...

35:22.921 --> 35:24.823
What?

35:26.258 --> 35:27.426
Nothing.

35:27.459 --> 35:28.860
You were played.

35:28.894 --> 35:30.496
That's what
you were thinking.

35:30.529 --> 35:32.631
You got to stay awake, sis.
They're sharks,

35:32.664 --> 35:34.666
they'll kill us if they can.

35:38.237 --> 35:40.572
You screwed me.

35:40.606 --> 35:42.541
Laurel. Hey, how are you?
Come on in.
You got me drinking

35:42.574 --> 35:44.643
and then you fed me
a piece of misinformation...

35:44.676 --> 35:46.412
Hey, wait a minute. I wrote
a number on a piece of paper...

35:46.445 --> 35:47.646
A number that you faked.

35:47.679 --> 35:48.947
...to see if you'd steal it.

35:48.980 --> 35:50.382
That's all.

35:50.416 --> 35:52.584
You didn't have to steal it.

35:53.752 --> 35:55.221
You're right.

35:55.254 --> 35:56.588
Thanks for the education.

35:56.622 --> 35:58.624
Take care.

36:09.635 --> 36:10.602
(indistinct conversations)

36:10.636 --> 36:11.870
SENATOR:
My friends,

36:11.903 --> 36:14.206
this is a fiasco
of historic proportions.

36:14.240 --> 36:16.775
We are now the godless,

36:16.808 --> 36:19.311
"Lincoln was gay" party.

36:19.345 --> 36:21.847
And we all know
who is to blame.

36:21.880 --> 36:24.283
(all clamoring)
May I say something, please?

36:24.316 --> 36:26.652
May I say something,
please?

36:26.685 --> 36:29.521
Hey, hey, let her speak.

36:29.555 --> 36:31.557
Hey. Let her speak.

36:33.859 --> 36:35.661
I have been patient.

36:35.694 --> 36:37.563
We all have.

36:37.596 --> 36:38.997
But I now call
for a vote

36:39.030 --> 36:41.733
to remove Senator Healy

36:41.767 --> 36:44.336
as whip,
and I put myself forward

36:44.370 --> 36:47.739
as a candidate to replace him.

36:47.773 --> 36:48.807
(applause)

36:48.840 --> 36:50.609
MAN:
Great idea.

36:50.642 --> 36:52.978
(shouts of agreement)

36:59.318 --> 37:00.852
Hi.

37:00.886 --> 37:02.421
I work for Senator Healy
and he said

37:02.454 --> 37:03.889
I could access
the monument tonight.

37:03.922 --> 37:06.492
Uh, the government's shut down.
No one gets in.

37:06.525 --> 37:10.262
What's your name?
Stan. Good.

37:10.296 --> 37:12.531
Senator Healy's looking
to make some budget cuts

37:12.564 --> 37:15.033
to the security payroll...
That's not gonna work, ma'am.

37:15.066 --> 37:16.902
Would you please move along?

37:16.935 --> 37:19.938
I'm sorry, I just did
not have a good day.

37:22.408 --> 37:25.444
Okay, here's the thing:

37:25.477 --> 37:28.680
a young girl with cancer
traveled across the country

37:28.714 --> 37:31.049
to see all the major monuments,
and this is the last one.

37:31.082 --> 37:33.319
She's a fan of Lincoln
and all she wants

37:33.352 --> 37:34.786
is her picture
in front of him.

37:34.820 --> 37:36.021
Okay?

37:40.559 --> 37:41.827
Ten minutes.

37:41.860 --> 37:42.828
Seriously?

37:42.861 --> 37:44.963
Ten minutes.

37:59.445 --> 38:02.080
Wow.

38:02.113 --> 38:03.582
Yeah.

38:03.615 --> 38:05.617
It's pretty cool,
isn't it?

38:05.651 --> 38:07.453
I've never been here.

38:07.486 --> 38:09.054
Can you believe that?

38:09.087 --> 38:11.823
I've lived here my whole life
and I've never been here.

38:11.857 --> 38:14.926
I'd come here
every day.

38:14.960 --> 38:17.563
HENRY:
Hey, you two.

38:35.414 --> 38:38.450
"We here highly resolve that:

38:38.484 --> 38:40.386
"these dead shall not
have died in vain--

38:40.419 --> 38:42.888
that this nation,
under God..."

38:42.921 --> 38:44.723
HENRY:
Not under God.

38:44.756 --> 38:47.559
Dad, please shut up.

38:47.593 --> 38:49.928
"...shall have
a new birth of freedom--

38:49.961 --> 38:52.130
"and that the government
of the people,

38:52.163 --> 38:53.699
"by the people,

38:53.732 --> 38:54.900
"and for the people

38:54.933 --> 38:57.769
shall not perish
from the earth."

38:57.803 --> 39:00.839
What happened to everything?

39:00.872 --> 39:03.675
Why does nobody
think that way anymore?

39:03.709 --> 39:05.143
They probably do,
they just

39:05.176 --> 39:07.012
don't like
talking about it.

39:07.045 --> 39:10.516
Things were just as bad
when Lincoln was president.

39:12.183 --> 39:15.020
People need to
not just give up.

39:34.540 --> 39:36.542
*

39:52.458 --> 39:53.992
*

40:17.082 --> 40:18.950
(phone rings)

40:18.984 --> 40:21.186
(sighs)
(phone beeps)

40:21.219 --> 40:23.188
Hello?

40:23.221 --> 40:25.557
Hi, Abby.
You caught me off guard.

40:25.591 --> 40:28.093
Is this a bad time?
No, no, it's fine-- I'm just

40:28.126 --> 40:30.696
getting back from the Lincoln
Memorial and it was amazing.

40:30.729 --> 40:32.130
I thought it was
just a tourist thing.
I don't think

40:32.163 --> 40:33.231
I've been since
high school.

40:33.264 --> 40:34.600
I know.

40:34.633 --> 40:36.702
It was kind of...

40:36.735 --> 40:37.869
inspiring.

40:37.903 --> 40:40.238
Listen, you were right, I was

40:40.271 --> 40:41.840
totally out of line
the other night,

40:41.873 --> 40:42.541
and I'm so sorry...

40:42.574 --> 40:44.142
I shouldn't have said all that.

40:44.175 --> 40:47.178
I mean, I know who you are.

40:48.514 --> 40:50.148
Maybe I was jealous.

40:50.181 --> 40:52.117
I'm sorry.
It's this town.

40:52.150 --> 40:54.019
I hate this town.

40:55.186 --> 40:56.888
And I don't, at the same time.

40:56.922 --> 40:59.525
You know what?
Do you want to come over now?

40:59.558 --> 41:01.192
I was just making some tea.

41:01.226 --> 41:03.929
Tea sounds good.

41:03.962 --> 41:05.631
Maybe a rain check.

41:05.664 --> 41:07.065
Okay.

41:07.098 --> 41:08.700
I'll text you, Laurel.

41:08.734 --> 41:10.769
Great. Okay.

41:10.802 --> 41:12.037
Bye.

41:12.070 --> 41:14.606
(doorknob rattling)

41:16.975 --> 41:18.510
STACIE:
Abby?

41:18.544 --> 41:20.178
(laughing):
I can't open the door.

41:20.211 --> 41:22.013
Don't worry.

41:22.047 --> 41:23.915
It'll be over
in a minute.
(rattling continues)

41:23.949 --> 41:25.517
Abby.

41:29.855 --> 41:32.157
There's something in here.

41:37.696 --> 41:39.698
Abby!

41:39.731 --> 41:40.899
Abby!

41:40.932 --> 41:42.100
Abby!

41:42.133 --> 41:43.802
Get me out of here!

41:43.835 --> 41:45.637
Abby, there's bugs in here!

41:45.671 --> 41:47.072
Help me!

41:47.105 --> 41:49.608
("You Might Think"
by The Cars playing loudly)

41:49.641 --> 41:51.242
Abby!

41:51.276 --> 41:53.979
(sobbing):
Abby!

41:54.012 --> 41:57.048
Abby!
(music drowning out screams)

41:59.618 --> 42:01.920
