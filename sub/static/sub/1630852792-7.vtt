accept my will.

03:03.680 --> 03:05.760
[mechanical robot whirring]

03:06.480 --> 03:09.920
The archeotech we seek
is lost knowledge.

03:10.440 --> 03:13.240
To reclaim such knowledge
is revelation.

03:13.960 --> 03:19.480
Revelation is worth any expenditure
of energy, material or life.

03:20.160 --> 03:22.200
Therefore we must proceed.

03:22.280 --> 03:23.560
No matter the risk.

03:25.240 --> 03:27.560
You understand this, I know.

03:28.040 --> 03:30.720
No blasphemy of intelligence
touches you.

03:31.320 --> 03:34.040
You are a component of divinity,

03:34.120 --> 03:39.320
therefore in the spirit that moves
in electro and gear, you understand.

03:48.640 --> 03:52.560
I give unto thy mechanisms
the command to protect.

forgive the crudeness

Without replacement of damaged

06:26.920 --> 06:31.520
motive capacity is projected
at sixty-one percent of optimal.

06:31.840 --> 06:34.480
The probability of us
reaching the archeotech,

06:34.800 --> 06:37.160
I would estimate at no more than...

06:37.640 --> 06:39.840
twenty-five point two three percent.

06:42.280 --> 06:43.360
[mechanical robot whirring]

06:43.440 --> 06:47.120
It is not a pessimistic calculation.

06:48.080 --> 06:50.160
[mechanical robot whirring]

06:51.160 --> 06:54.240
Logic and truth do not allow
for hope.

06:54.760 --> 06:58.040
To hope is to listen
to the weakness of flesh.

06:58.480 --> 07:00.800
To calculate is divine.

07:01.280 --> 07:06.360
This chain of logic is correct
and what is correct is sacred.

07:06.440 --> 07:07.520
[mechanical robot whirring]

07:09.200 --> 07:12.960
There is no sacrifice
that shall not be paid for knowledge.

07:13.560 --> 07:16.400
Both the sacrifice and the knowledge

07:16.480 --> 07:19.280
are the blessed fulfilment
of function.

[mechanical robot whirring]

08:11.720 --> 08:14.720
A fire set to give light

08:15.320 --> 08:16.480

09:20.920 --> 09:23.400
It would be illogical to fire.

09:23.760 --> 09:26.160
I mean you no immediate harm.

09:26.640 --> 09:28.040
[sighs]

09:29.320 --> 09:30.560
[sighs]

09:30.640 --> 09:32.680
[mechanical robot whirring]

09:34.040 --> 09:35.440
Vigilance protocol.

09:36.520 --> 09:38.280
[mechanical robot whirring]

09:38.720 --> 09:43.840
While the combustion of promethium
provides heat and illumination,

09:44.240 --> 09:48.720
in current atmospheric conditions,
its light will be perceivable

09:48.800 --> 09:53.720
up to a distance of approximately
three point one three miles.

09:54.360 --> 09:57.080
Additionally, your biological sight

09:57.160 --> 10:00.480
will be limited in acuity
by its illumination.

10:00.560 --> 10:02.920
The fire is not advisable.

10:06.560 --> 10:07.640
You are...

10:09.640 --> 10:11.720
you are with the Mechanicus.

10:12.160 --> 10:13.360
Confirmed.

10:16.280 --> 10:17.560
[Soldier] I...

10:17.640 --> 10:19.680
[Soldier] I thought
there were no other survivors.

10:20.480 --> 10:22.240
I haven't seen anyone else
out here...

10:23.040 --> 10:27.320
[Tech-priest] The forces of the Imperium
and the Adeptus Mechanicus

10:27.400 --> 10:30.320
destroyed sufficient numbers
of the Orks

10:30.400 --> 10:33.080
to render their invasion non-viable.

10:33.560 --> 10:37.120
The battle was a victory
by the standard military criteria.

10:37.880 --> 10:40.000
-We won?
-Confirmed.

10:40.520 --> 10:42.440
[laughs]

10:42.520 --> 10:43.720
Then we are saved.

10:44.840 --> 10:48.040
We just need to reach the rest
of the Imperial forces...

10:48.120 --> 10:52.120
[Tech-priest] The majority of the forces
opposing the Ork invasion

10:52.200 --> 10:54.160
have been withdrawn.

10:54.240 --> 10:56.920
But... but the Orks are still here.

10:57.000 --> 10:58.160
I've seen them.

10:58.240 --> 10:59.400
Hundreds of them.

11:00.000 --> 11:03.400
The numerical value of Orks
on the surface

11:03.480 --> 11:05.720
has been deemed no longer a threat,

11:06.240 --> 11:09.560
and the forces of the Imperium
are needed elsewhere.

11:09.960 --> 11:14.160
This world is ruined,
its productivity degraded.

11:14.560 --> 11:16.640
Its value is lower than others

11:16.720 --> 11:20.520
that might still be protected,
therefore this...

11:21.280 --> 11:22.600
is victory.

11:24.080 --> 11:26.600
It is a simple calculation.

11:28.360 --> 11:29.360
[sighs]

11:29.800 --> 11:31.000
So...

11:31.880 --> 11:33.440
no one is coming.

11:34.680 --> 11:35.840
I am alone...

11:39.360 --> 11:40.480
[Soldier] Then...

11:40.560 --> 11:42.280
then what are you doing here?

11:43.240 --> 11:45.440
[Tech-priest] I have a function to fulfil.

11:45.960 --> 11:48.840
But you said that the Imperial
forces have withdrawn?

11:48.920 --> 11:52.640
The Machine is eternal
and so is its truth.

11:53.160 --> 11:56.320
No will of man can undo that axiom.

11:56.400 --> 11:59.880
I am a tooth of the turning
cog of knowledge.

11:59.960 --> 12:01.320
[Tech-priest] Battles occur.

12:01.680 --> 12:06.960
Flesh fails and rots,
but the quest for knowledge remains.

12:07.040 --> 12:08.360
A quest?

12:08.840 --> 12:12.120
[Soldier]
So... you are looking for something?

12:13.720 --> 12:19.200
I seek an archeotech device
that has lain hidden on this world.

12:19.640 --> 12:20.800
Archeotech?

12:21.960 --> 12:22.960
[gasps]

12:23.440 --> 12:25.080
Is it valuable?

12:25.160 --> 12:28.800
The data indicates
that the archeotech I seek

12:28.880 --> 12:32.040
is a form of electro-ferro-infusion.

12:32.480 --> 12:36.760
Both a power source
and a means of metallic regeneration.

12:37.520 --> 12:40.920
If it is preserved
and its secrets replicated,

12:41.000 --> 12:45.080
it will unlock the function
of countless other machines.

12:45.160 --> 12:49.640
The use and implications
of this technology are profound.

12:50.120 --> 12:51.800
Worlds can be rebuilt.

12:52.120 --> 12:53.680
Legions made whole.

12:54.080 --> 12:55.360
Wars won.

12:55.680 --> 12:59.800
The value of such a device
cannot be quantified.

13:00.360 --> 13:01.360
[sighs]

13:02.240 --> 13:03.680
I don't understand...

13:03.760 --> 13:05.400
Of course you do not.

13:05.920 --> 13:09.160
The existence of this archeotech
is a secret.

13:09.800 --> 13:12.560
No others from my order
know of its location.

13:13.240 --> 13:16.480
That is why I alone remain
to find it.

13:16.960 --> 13:20.280
[Tech-priest] Some things are too
valuable to trust to others.

13:21.200 --> 13:22.720

13:25.920 --> 13:29.040
is payment for the aid
I require from you.

13:30.080 --> 13:33.600
But, you are going to take me
with you.

13:34.760 --> 13:35.840
Aren't you?

13:36.560 --> 13:37.800
[Tech-priest] Negative.

meaning to sacrifice.

13:50.720 --> 13:52.800

13:52.880 --> 13:56.960
The probability of encountering
further enemy combatants

13:57.040 --> 14:00.360
is ninety-six point five six percent.

14:01.120 --> 14:03.160
If we cannot overcome them,

14:03.240 --> 14:05.360
then we will not recover
the archeotech.

14:05.800 --> 14:08.160
The archeotech must be recovered.

14:08.240 --> 14:12.240
Therefore your optimal function
must be restored.

14:12.560 --> 14:14.320
This act was necessary.

14:15.760 --> 14:18.040
[Tech-priest] I could not let you fail.

14:19.840 --> 14:21.880
Who else is there to help me?

14:25.480 --> 14:29.240
Spirit of this machine,
you are made whole again.

[mechanical robot whirring]

20:54.640 --> 20:55.960
Rise.

21:07.480 --> 21:11.600
[rising mechanical noise]

21:27.440 --> 21:29.560
The flesh is weak, but...

21:30.280 --> 21:33.800
the machine is eternal.

21:35.080 --> 21:36.480
[mechanical robot whirring]

21:38.480 --> 21:42.000
If I had not used the device,
then you would no longer function.

21:43.080 --> 21:47.280
The existence of further archeotech
on this planet is possible.

21:47.880 --> 21:50.280
The loss of the device
was a certainty

21:50.360 --> 21:52.920
if I had not used it
to restore your function.

21:53.320 --> 21:56.680
Therefore, the use
and exhaustion of the device

21:56.760 --> 21:59.360
allowed the quest for knowledge
to continue.

21:59.920 --> 22:04.440
This chain of logic is correct,
and what is correct is sacred.

22:06.720 --> 22:08.640
I cannot continue alone.

22:14.640 --> 22:17.880
POTENTIAL ARCHEOTECH LOCATION

22:17.960 --> 22:21.120
PROBABILITY 00.1%

22:24.200 --> 22:26.560
[pensive music]

22:30.880 --> 22:34.400
Spirit of this machine,
heed my will...

22:41.680 --> 22:42.960
Follow.

22:46.760 --> 22:51.480
[tense music]

22:57.400 --> 23:01.320
