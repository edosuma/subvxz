00:02.429 --> 00:03.395
DOLE: Previously
on The Practice...

00:03.430 --> 00:05.465
My name is Hannibal Lecter.

00:05.498 --> 00:07.467
You plan to argue insanity?

00:07.500 --> 00:08.835
You murdered and ate

00:08.868 --> 00:10.737
three people, Mr. Lecter.

00:10.770 --> 00:11.904
I didn't kill them.

00:11.938 --> 00:13.906
The other man killed them.

00:13.940 --> 00:15.407
What other man?

00:15.442 --> 00:18.044
He's never denied
consuming the victims,

00:18.077 --> 00:19.679
but it's always
the other persona

00:19.712 --> 00:20.913
who stabbed the girls.

00:20.947 --> 00:21.781
What do you think?

00:21.814 --> 00:23.049
MAN: I don't know.

00:23.082 --> 00:24.617
All I am sure of

00:24.651 --> 00:27.454
is as crazy as he may be,

00:27.487 --> 00:29.321
he is not stupid.

00:29.355 --> 00:30.657
Hello, Clarice.

00:30.690 --> 00:31.891
DONNELL: Oh, brother.

00:31.924 --> 00:34.561
Does Bobby know?

00:34.594 --> 00:35.828
Does he know what?

00:35.862 --> 00:37.497
That you're in love with me.

00:37.530 --> 00:40.132
GAMBLE: When you saw
these women murdered

00:40.166 --> 00:41.768
by this other man--

00:41.801 --> 00:43.803
I gave the police
a partial description.

00:43.836 --> 00:45.772
I told them where he kills.

00:45.805 --> 00:47.139
Instead of persecuting me,

00:47.173 --> 00:48.240
you should be looking for him,

00:48.274 --> 00:49.576
especially, since...

00:49.609 --> 00:51.911
he's planning to kill Clarice.

00:51.944 --> 00:53.245
DOLE: I got stabbed
two years ago.

00:53.279 --> 00:54.581
I got stabbed, Bobby.

00:54.614 --> 00:56.583
A man stuck a knife
into me three times.

00:56.616 --> 00:59.519
I have never gone back
to being okay

00:59.552 --> 01:01.153
no matter how much
that you insist

01:01.187 --> 01:02.455
that I have.

01:02.489 --> 01:04.857
We find the defendant,
Lawrence O'Malley,

01:04.891 --> 01:06.859
not guilty.

01:06.893 --> 01:08.127
Thank you, Bobby...

01:10.196 --> 01:11.197
Clarice.

01:17.770 --> 01:19.772
(phone ringing)

01:27.046 --> 01:28.180
Hello?

01:32.184 --> 01:33.653
Hello?

01:34.987 --> 01:35.922
(receiver clicks)

01:35.955 --> 01:37.957
(dial tone)

01:45.732 --> 01:47.467
DONNELL: What about
entrapping him?

01:47.500 --> 01:48.968
We've thought
about that.

01:49.001 --> 01:50.169
The thing is,

01:50.202 --> 01:51.538
it's not like the guy
hits often.

01:51.571 --> 01:52.772
And he's killed three girls

01:52.805 --> 01:54.306
in two years.

01:54.340 --> 01:55.207
What about using me?

01:55.241 --> 01:56.308
Are you crazy?

01:56.342 --> 01:57.577
I'm going crazy, Bobby.

01:57.610 --> 01:58.545
The longer he stays out there

01:58.578 --> 01:59.779
calling me on the phone.

01:59.812 --> 02:01.013
There's no way
to protect you.

02:01.047 --> 02:02.449
DOLE: So, what,
I just go to bed every night

02:02.482 --> 02:03.916
consoling myself that one day

02:03.950 --> 02:05.217
they'll finally get him?

02:05.251 --> 02:06.953
DONNELL: You will not
be used as bait

02:06.986 --> 02:08.253
for a serial killer.

02:08.287 --> 02:09.489
It wouldn't work
anyway, Lindsay.

02:09.521 --> 02:10.857
The guy's too smart for that.

02:10.889 --> 02:12.258
DOLE: Well, come up
with something, Helen.

02:12.291 --> 02:14.927
I am not going through
this again.

02:17.063 --> 02:18.465
What I'd like to do
is get him

02:18.498 --> 02:19.632
civilly committed.

02:20.533 --> 02:21.468
Can you?

02:22.268 --> 02:23.636
It'll be tough, especially,

02:23.670 --> 02:26.773
since he was acquitted,
but we can try.

02:26.806 --> 02:29.041
Lindsay, I need you
to testify against him

02:29.075 --> 02:31.377
to help convince the judge
he's nuts.

02:31.410 --> 02:32.211
Fine.

02:32.244 --> 02:34.447
Time and place, I'll be there.

02:34.947 --> 02:35.915
We'll pick him up
tomorrow.

02:35.948 --> 02:38.250
But, again,
it's a real long shot.

02:38.284 --> 02:39.686
Just get him.

02:39.719 --> 02:41.353
And if he resists,

02:41.387 --> 02:42.689
shoot him.

02:51.598 --> 02:54.601
(music playing)

03:40.780 --> 03:42.248
What do you mean it's lost?

03:42.281 --> 03:43.115
The findings aren't lost,

03:43.149 --> 03:44.684
just the rape kit itself.

03:44.717 --> 03:45.952
Who lost it?

03:45.985 --> 03:47.454
We don't know.

03:47.487 --> 03:48.988
YOUNG: We thought
it had been sent to our lab,

03:49.021 --> 03:50.590
and we were waiting
for the results.

03:50.623 --> 03:51.824
We called them again today,

03:51.858 --> 03:52.625
and they've told us

03:52.659 --> 03:53.993
they never even received it.

03:54.026 --> 03:56.162
Do your storage records show
it was sent out?

03:56.195 --> 03:57.296
No.

03:57.329 --> 03:59.165
YOUNG: Your Honor,
since we were not afforded

03:59.198 --> 04:01.333
the opportunity to conduct
our own tests,

04:01.367 --> 04:03.603
the DNA evidence
has to be excluded.

04:03.636 --> 04:05.271
You can cross
our technicians.

04:05.304 --> 04:06.939
It's not the same
as doing our own test,

04:06.973 --> 04:07.740
and you know it.

04:08.508 --> 04:10.176
I can't let it in,
Ms. Gamble.

04:10.209 --> 04:11.711
Your Honor,
they weren't even serious

04:11.744 --> 04:13.145
about doing
their own test.

04:13.179 --> 04:14.981
Why did they wait
till the eve of this trial?

04:15.014 --> 04:16.882
Well, we're serious
about it now.

04:16.916 --> 04:19.084
This is amusing
to you, Eugene?

04:19.118 --> 04:21.320
WHITE: Counsel,
if they didn't get access,

04:21.353 --> 04:23.890
the DNA evidence is excluded.

04:25.357 --> 04:26.859
So what that mean?

04:26.893 --> 04:28.628
YOUNG: It means
their whole case now

04:28.661 --> 04:29.996
is the victim's ID.

04:30.029 --> 04:31.831
Let's not get cocky.

04:31.864 --> 04:32.899
At probable cause,

04:32.932 --> 04:34.200
she was pretty convincing.

04:34.233 --> 04:36.436
But at least now
they're offering a plea.

04:36.469 --> 04:37.604
Yeah. What is it?

04:37.637 --> 04:38.571
Fifteen years.

04:38.605 --> 04:39.906
Oh, no way, man!

04:39.939 --> 04:41.040
YOUNG: Third strike, Jerry.

04:41.073 --> 04:42.909
If convicted, you get life.

04:43.776 --> 04:45.478
All right. Look...

04:45.512 --> 04:46.913
I got a twin brother.

04:46.946 --> 04:48.214
Suppose we put him at the table

04:48.247 --> 04:50.450
and let her identify him.

04:50.483 --> 04:51.818
That's reasonable doubt.

04:51.851 --> 04:53.352
We can't do that.

04:54.020 --> 04:55.788
I ain't doing no 15.

04:58.024 --> 05:00.326
Rape victims
supposed to be shaky.

05:00.359 --> 05:02.462
That's what I hear.

05:05.364 --> 05:07.199
Let's go to trial.

05:07.767 --> 05:09.536
And, Eugene,

05:09.569 --> 05:12.605
don't hold back on this bitch.

05:15.842 --> 05:17.309
You lost the evidence?

05:17.343 --> 05:20.346
Callie, we can still win.
How?

05:20.379 --> 05:22.682
GAMBLE: Well, right now
it comes down to your word,

05:22.715 --> 05:24.717
which is very compelling.

05:24.751 --> 05:26.586
You don't look so sure, Helen.

05:26.619 --> 05:29.756
GAMBLE: Look, I'm completely
prepared to go forward,

05:29.789 --> 05:31.491
but I'm also prepared
to go back

05:31.524 --> 05:32.625
and offer eight years.

05:32.659 --> 05:34.961
If you think--
Eight?

05:34.994 --> 05:36.028
It's a conviction.

05:36.062 --> 05:37.597
It takes him off the streets.

05:37.630 --> 05:40.500
Besides, a trial
could be very unpleasant.

05:41.233 --> 05:43.302
Eight is not an option.

05:43.335 --> 05:45.237
Not for what he did to me.

05:46.205 --> 05:47.774
Okay.

05:47.807 --> 05:49.709
(knocks on door)

05:49.742 --> 05:50.877
GAMBLE: I'll see you
in the courtroom,

05:50.910 --> 05:51.911
division three.

05:51.944 --> 05:53.680
Okay.

05:58.618 --> 05:59.752
You get him yet?

05:59.786 --> 06:00.753
GAMBLE: Noon.

06:00.787 --> 06:02.354
I'm going on the ride
personally

06:02.388 --> 06:03.690
to make sure things
aren't any more

06:03.723 --> 06:05.958
unconstitutional
than necessary.

06:05.992 --> 06:07.827
Helen, is it possible
to do this

06:07.860 --> 06:09.128
without Lindsay testifying?

06:09.161 --> 06:10.597
She's not in very good shape.

06:10.630 --> 06:12.699
GAMBLE: Bobby,
even with Lindsay,

06:12.732 --> 06:13.900
this is a long shot.

06:13.933 --> 06:14.734
We need her to say

06:14.767 --> 06:16.068
how afraid she is of this guy.

06:16.102 --> 06:18.037
Otherwise--
DONNELL: Anything he said

06:18.070 --> 06:18.871
to her, I was there for.

06:18.905 --> 06:21.140
I can provide--
GAMBLE: We need her.

06:21.173 --> 06:23.275
Look, I'm not gonna bother
picking him up

06:23.309 --> 06:24.343
if I can't count on her.

06:24.376 --> 06:26.045
You saw how she was last night.

06:26.078 --> 06:27.013
GAMBLE: I did.

06:27.046 --> 06:28.448
But do you want this guy

06:28.481 --> 06:30.382
in custody or not?

06:33.119 --> 06:34.220
(sighs)

06:34.253 --> 06:36.122
I was opening
my apartment door,

06:36.155 --> 06:38.157
and as I opened it,

06:38.190 --> 06:40.493
I was suddenly
shoved inside

06:40.527 --> 06:41.994
and then knocked
to the floor.

06:42.028 --> 06:43.663
GAMBLE: Do you see
the person today

06:43.696 --> 06:44.964
who knocked you
to the floor?

06:44.997 --> 06:47.667
Him, the defendant.

06:47.967 --> 06:49.401
GAMBLE: Are you sure
this is the man,

06:49.436 --> 06:50.670
Ms. Fairbanks?

06:50.703 --> 06:51.438
I'm positive.

06:51.471 --> 06:52.338
That's him.

06:53.473 --> 06:56.543
GAMBLE: Now, after
you were pulled to the floor,

06:56.576 --> 06:58.344
what happened next?

06:59.011 --> 07:00.713
He closed the door,

07:02.248 --> 07:03.650
and he told me
if I screamed

07:03.683 --> 07:04.784
he would kill me.

07:05.985 --> 07:09.956
He then, um, pulled
his pants down,

07:09.989 --> 07:12.925
and he started to climb
on top of me.

07:12.959 --> 07:15.562
Um, he pushed my skirt up,

07:15.595 --> 07:18.865
and I tried to get free,

07:18.898 --> 07:20.567
and that's when he punched me.

07:20.600 --> 07:22.001
GAMBLE: Where?

07:22.034 --> 07:23.570
FAIRBANKS: In the face.

07:23.603 --> 07:24.837
I took my key,

07:24.871 --> 07:26.573
and I tried to gouge him.

07:26.606 --> 07:29.509
I got him behind the ear.

07:29.542 --> 07:32.612
And then he hit me
three or four times,

07:32.645 --> 07:35.582
and I kind of
lost consciousness.

07:35.615 --> 07:38.284
And the next thing
I was aware of,

07:39.118 --> 07:41.353
he was ramming himself
into me.

07:41.387 --> 07:44.423
GAMBLE: Are you absolutely sure

07:44.457 --> 07:47.193
this is the man who raped you

07:47.226 --> 07:49.796
on the evening of March 11th?

07:49.829 --> 07:52.499
I am absolutely sure.

07:52.532 --> 07:54.767
I have nightmares
about his face.

07:54.801 --> 07:56.969
I try to get his face
out of my mind,

07:57.003 --> 07:58.204
but I can't.

07:58.237 --> 07:59.405
That's him.

07:59.439 --> 08:02.609
That's the man who raped me.

08:02.642 --> 08:04.310
GAMBLE: Thank you.

08:08.848 --> 08:10.550
YOUNG:
When the police arrived,

08:10.583 --> 08:12.184
you said you could not

08:12.218 --> 08:15.855
approximate the suspect's
height or build.

08:15.888 --> 08:18.625
I saw his face
very clearly.

08:18.658 --> 08:19.959
But you said
he had no facial hair.

08:19.992 --> 08:21.428
At the time
of my client's arrest,

08:21.461 --> 08:22.495
he had a moustache.

08:22.529 --> 08:24.431
FAIRBANKS: I evidently
didn't see the moustache,

08:24.464 --> 08:26.398
but I saw his eyes
and I recognize them.

08:26.433 --> 08:27.967
YOUNG: You told the police
you gouged him

08:28.000 --> 08:31.270
behind the ear, drawing blood.

08:31.303 --> 08:32.304
Are you aware that they found

08:32.337 --> 08:34.173
no scratches or marks
on my client?

08:34.206 --> 08:36.375
I thought I drew blood,

08:36.408 --> 08:38.811
but the blood
on my hand and key

08:38.845 --> 08:39.812
turned out to be my own,

08:39.846 --> 08:40.746
I guess.

08:40.780 --> 08:42.482
YOUNG: You guess?

08:42.515 --> 08:44.283
Did you describe
for the police

08:44.316 --> 08:46.318
the clothing the assailant
was wearing?

08:46.352 --> 08:47.487
No.

08:47.520 --> 08:48.721
You were knocked unconscious

08:48.755 --> 08:50.189
during the attack,
is that right?

08:50.222 --> 08:51.658
After the rape.

08:51.691 --> 08:52.459
I was conscious

08:52.492 --> 08:53.626
during the attack.

08:53.660 --> 08:55.895
YOUNG: Well, you testified
when he punched you

08:55.928 --> 08:59.065
three or four times
before the rape,

08:59.098 --> 09:01.067
you kind of lost consciousness.

09:01.100 --> 09:02.902
Are you now changing
that testimony?

09:02.935 --> 09:04.771
FAIRBANKS: I kind
of lost consciousness,

09:04.804 --> 09:06.473
but I was conscious
for the rape

09:06.506 --> 09:09.041
and I saw his face exactly.

09:09.075 --> 09:10.577
Except for the moustache.

09:11.243 --> 09:12.979
Yes.

09:13.012 --> 09:14.346
YOUNG: When you were suddenly
grabbed and dragged

09:14.380 --> 09:15.748
into your apartment,

09:15.782 --> 09:17.884
did you go into a little shock?

09:17.917 --> 09:19.752
If you're asking,
did it compromise

09:19.786 --> 09:22.221
my capacity to observe--
YOUNG: No.

09:22.254 --> 09:25.224
I'm asking, "Did you go
into a little shock?"

09:25.257 --> 09:26.493
Yes.

09:26.526 --> 09:28.461
YOUNG: "Compromise
your capacity to observe,"

09:28.495 --> 09:30.763
that's legal terminology.

09:30.797 --> 09:31.764
Are you a lawyer?

09:31.798 --> 09:33.265
No.

09:33.299 --> 09:35.101
YOUNG: Those were you own words,

09:35.835 --> 09:39.138
"Compromise your capacity
to observe"?

09:41.273 --> 09:42.909
Did Ms. Gamble
use that term with you?

09:42.942 --> 09:43.743
Objection.

09:43.776 --> 09:44.877
Sustained.

09:44.911 --> 09:46.513
YOUNG: Did the district attorney

09:46.546 --> 09:49.381
have concerns about
your capacity to observe?

09:49.415 --> 09:50.249
Objection!

09:50.282 --> 09:51.317
Sustained.

09:51.350 --> 09:53.686
Thank you, Ms. Fairbanks.

10:00.059 --> 10:01.327
GAMBLE: (sighs)

10:01.360 --> 10:02.862
I got to get back.

10:02.895 --> 10:04.396
If he doesn't come out soon--

10:04.431 --> 10:06.198
McGUIRE: Between 12:00
and 12:30 every day

10:06.232 --> 10:07.767
like clockwork.

10:07.800 --> 10:09.869
He'll be out.

10:09.902 --> 10:11.037
If this goes
before Judge Cooke--

10:11.070 --> 10:13.973
It's not gonna go
before Judge Cooke.

10:15.074 --> 10:17.944
His expert witness
doctor said

10:17.977 --> 10:21.213
stress and anger would make
the other man emerge.

10:21.247 --> 10:22.582
Maybe he'll wig out
and give us something

10:22.615 --> 10:23.550
we can use.

10:24.451 --> 10:25.918
Are you telling me
we should rough him up?

10:25.952 --> 10:27.086
GAMBLE: Oh, God, no.

10:27.119 --> 10:28.755
This has got to go clean.

10:28.788 --> 10:31.558
We're on shaky ground
as it is.

10:31.591 --> 10:32.859
I'll try to bait him a little

10:32.892 --> 10:34.326
and see what I can get.

10:37.764 --> 10:38.498
McGUIRE: Now.

10:38.531 --> 10:40.366
Okay. Move in.

10:40.399 --> 10:42.201
(siren wailing)

10:42.234 --> 10:43.335
MAN: Police!

10:43.369 --> 10:44.837
Lawrence O'Malley, stop!

10:44.871 --> 10:46.072
MAN: (indistinct) we're good.

10:46.105 --> 10:47.507
MAN: Let me see your hands.

10:48.541 --> 10:49.542
(tires screeching)

10:49.576 --> 10:50.843
McGUIRE: Mr. O'Malley,

10:50.877 --> 10:52.044
you need to come
with us please.

10:52.078 --> 10:53.379
What's going on?

10:53.412 --> 10:55.047
We want to check
your cholesterol.

10:55.081 --> 10:57.016
You've been eating
too much red meat.

10:59.552 --> 11:01.688
Remember me, Hannibal?

11:01.721 --> 11:03.823
Didn't we have relations?

11:03.856 --> 11:05.958
Well, we're gonna have
relations now.

11:05.992 --> 11:07.794
You're going
for a nice little stay

11:07.827 --> 11:10.162
to the rubber room lodge.

11:10.196 --> 11:11.464
I was acquitted.

11:11.498 --> 11:13.933
Oh, I must be looking
for the other man.

11:13.966 --> 11:15.367
Why don't you send him out

11:15.401 --> 11:16.903
so I can talk to him?

11:18.070 --> 11:19.972
Do you think I'm an idiot?

11:20.507 --> 11:21.741
I can see
from your expression

11:21.774 --> 11:23.576
I've pissed you off.

11:23.610 --> 11:25.445
Those other girls
pissed you off,

11:25.478 --> 11:27.246
didn't they, Hannibal?

11:27.847 --> 11:29.782
It's time for the other man
to come out

11:29.816 --> 11:32.051
and take care of business.

11:38.858 --> 11:40.593
I need to call my lawyer.

11:44.531 --> 11:46.132
Take him.

12:01.481 --> 12:02.715
DOLE:
Helen's not handling it?

12:02.749 --> 12:05.317
She's in trial, plus
she could be a witness, so--

12:05.351 --> 12:06.218
Who's doing it?

12:06.252 --> 12:07.754
State attorney
Michael Scannel.

12:07.787 --> 12:08.955
Helen says he's good.

12:08.988 --> 12:10.089
Who's representing O'Malley?

12:10.122 --> 12:11.991
DONNELL: That I don't know,
but whoever it is,

12:12.024 --> 12:13.192
we got a hearing at 4:00

12:13.225 --> 12:14.861
to get him kicked.

12:14.894 --> 12:15.795
We should be there.

12:15.828 --> 12:16.896
Fine.

12:18.030 --> 12:19.466
(sighs)

12:19.499 --> 12:20.733
DONNELL: Lindsay...

12:22.401 --> 12:24.637
I think you need
to see somebody.

12:26.138 --> 12:27.940
See somebody?

12:27.974 --> 12:28.775
A shrink?

12:29.308 --> 12:30.209
Yeah.

12:30.242 --> 12:32.211
What, it's unhealthy for me
to be on edge?

12:32.244 --> 12:33.813
Of course not,

12:33.846 --> 12:35.214
which is why
you need to talk to--

12:35.247 --> 12:37.650
I'm talking to you.

12:37.684 --> 12:39.018
Lindsay, you are the most

12:39.051 --> 12:42.254
rock-steady person
I have ever met.

12:44.156 --> 12:45.958
But right now...

12:47.059 --> 12:48.761
you really feel on the verge

12:48.795 --> 12:50.697
of a breakdown.

12:51.831 --> 12:53.700
And I'm worried.

12:53.733 --> 12:57.036
I'm gonna get
some references,

12:57.069 --> 12:59.271
and then maybe
we can see somebody.

13:04.777 --> 13:05.912
Sure.

13:11.751 --> 13:13.352
I was at home.

13:13.385 --> 13:14.086
All night?

13:14.120 --> 13:15.722
JERRY: After 6:00.

13:15.755 --> 13:17.356
Uh, I got to be at work
at 5:00 a. m.

13:17.389 --> 13:19.191
so I don't go out
on weeknights.

13:19.225 --> 13:20.960
Well, Mr. Cochran,
it seems that--

13:20.993 --> 13:22.361
GAMBLE: Sidebar, Your Honor.

13:28.735 --> 13:32.004
I'm sorry. The inadmissibility
of the DNA evidence aside,

13:32.038 --> 13:33.940
Mr. Berluti knows
what the results are,

13:33.973 --> 13:36.108
which means he knows
the witness is lying here.

13:36.142 --> 13:39.011
I do not know those results
to be accurate.

13:39.045 --> 13:41.280
That's why we wanted to do
our own test,

13:41.313 --> 13:42.715
which we couldn't
since the Commonwealth

13:42.749 --> 13:43.750
lost the rape kit.

13:43.783 --> 13:44.984
Oh, come on.

13:45.017 --> 13:47.053
Our client claims
he was home alone.

13:47.086 --> 13:49.121
I do not know that claim
to be false.

13:49.155 --> 13:50.422
And I'm entitled
to put him up here

13:50.457 --> 13:52.024
to tell his story.

13:52.058 --> 13:53.025
WHITE: Mr. Berluti,

13:53.059 --> 13:54.260
are you representing
to this court

13:54.293 --> 13:56.262
that you think
the DNA test results

13:56.295 --> 13:57.363
are inaccurate?

13:57.396 --> 13:59.298
I'm representing I don't know.

14:00.066 --> 14:01.768
You're full of crap,

14:03.570 --> 14:06.238
but technically
I can't stop you.

14:06.272 --> 14:07.339
Step back.

14:13.245 --> 14:14.681
Mr. Cochran,

14:14.714 --> 14:16.348
you sat here this morning

14:16.382 --> 14:17.750
and heard Ms. Fairbanks

14:17.784 --> 14:20.520
identify you as the person
who raped her.

14:20.553 --> 14:22.288
Well, she got it wrong.

14:23.122 --> 14:25.091
Look, I'm no saint

14:25.124 --> 14:27.426
but I don't rape people.

14:27.460 --> 14:29.662
You got it wrong.
GAMBLE: Objection!

14:29.696 --> 14:32.164
WHITE: Don't address
the victim, sir.

14:32.198 --> 14:34.901
I didn't do it.

14:34.934 --> 14:36.068
As God as my witness,

14:36.102 --> 14:38.170
I'm innocent of this.

14:38.605 --> 14:39.972
GAMBLE: You held up
a convenience store

14:40.006 --> 14:42.642
with a gun six years ago.

14:42.675 --> 14:44.276
Was God your witness
that night?

14:44.310 --> 14:46.646
I already said
I ain't no saint,

14:46.679 --> 14:47.947
but I don't rape.

14:47.980 --> 14:50.149
But you are a convicted
armed robber.

14:50.883 --> 14:51.918
Yeah.

14:51.951 --> 14:53.352
GAMBLE: Mr. Cochran,

14:53.385 --> 14:54.587
have you ever been convicted

14:54.621 --> 14:56.155
of assaulting a woman?

14:56.188 --> 14:57.924
That was a domestic dispute.

14:57.957 --> 14:59.759
The answer
to my question is yes.

15:00.593 --> 15:01.794
Yes.

15:01.828 --> 15:03.430
GAMBLE: And, Mr. Cochran,
do you go to a bar

15:03.463 --> 15:04.497
known as Jasper's?

15:04.531 --> 15:06.398
Sometime.
GAMBLE: Sometimes?

15:06.433 --> 15:08.134
Well, if I have witnesses
that would say

15:08.167 --> 15:11.438
you frequent it
two to three times a week,

15:11.471 --> 15:12.439
would they be lying?

15:12.472 --> 15:14.574
I go there sometime
for a beer.

15:14.607 --> 15:15.475
Weeknights?

15:15.508 --> 15:16.943
JERRY: Yeah,
but I go home early.

15:16.976 --> 15:20.279
So your testimony that you
don't go out weeknights,

15:20.312 --> 15:21.848
that wasn't accurate, was it?

15:22.582 --> 15:24.617
I should have said,
"I don't stay out late

15:24.651 --> 15:25.685
on weeknights."

15:25.718 --> 15:27.820
GAMBLE: I see.
And this particular weeknight,

15:27.854 --> 15:29.856
you didn't go out
to Jasper's at all,

15:29.889 --> 15:30.723
did you?

15:30.757 --> 15:31.858
No, I was at home.

15:31.891 --> 15:33.926
Straight home
where you were seen by whom?

15:33.960 --> 15:35.094
JERRY: Nobody.
I was home alone,

15:35.127 --> 15:36.328
like I said.

15:36.362 --> 15:38.364
GAMBLE: So the only person
who saw you that night

15:38.397 --> 15:39.866
was Callie Fairbanks.

15:39.899 --> 15:41.534
No, she got it wrong.

15:41.568 --> 15:42.702
GAMBLE: Oh, she got it wrong?

15:42.735 --> 15:43.536
Objection!

15:43.570 --> 15:44.403
Yes, she did.

15:44.437 --> 15:45.204
WHITE: Overruled.

15:45.237 --> 15:47.440
You raped her,
almost killed her.

15:47.474 --> 15:48.775
Objection!
Sustained.

15:48.808 --> 15:50.276
Now, you're lying about it.

15:50.309 --> 15:51.277
I'm not lying.

15:51.310 --> 15:52.378
GAMBLE: I see.

15:52.411 --> 15:53.746
You beat up women.

15:53.780 --> 15:55.047
You're an armed robber,

15:55.081 --> 15:56.048
but you're not a rapist.

15:56.082 --> 15:58.551
You go out several nights
a week to Jasper's,

15:58.585 --> 16:00.487
but the night
Callie Fairbanks was raped,

16:00.520 --> 16:02.889
you just happened
to be home alone.

16:02.922 --> 16:04.223
That's your testimony.

16:04.256 --> 16:05.324
Yes!

16:06.425 --> 16:08.528
I don't rape.

16:16.402 --> 16:18.270
You didn't protect me.
YOUNG: Jerry--

16:18.304 --> 16:19.405
JERRY: You let her
go off on me.

16:19.439 --> 16:20.440
Calm down.
JERRY: You're pulling punches

16:20.473 --> 16:21.941
in there, Eugene.
I didn't pull no punches

16:21.974 --> 16:23.643
in there, and I'm not
pulling them with you.

16:23.676 --> 16:25.912
We got to plea this out.
What?

16:25.945 --> 16:27.547
BERLUTI: Jerry,
if we lose here,

16:27.580 --> 16:29.882
your third strike,
you're gone for good.

16:29.916 --> 16:32.919
It's too risky not to think
about pleading.

16:34.020 --> 16:37.757
(music playing)

16:37.790 --> 16:38.858
Okay.

16:40.359 --> 16:42.562
Okay.

16:42.595 --> 16:44.230
I got a twin brother.

16:44.263 --> 16:45.765
He gonna pay you a visit.

16:45.798 --> 16:48.234
Why?
JERRY: Because he is.

16:48.935 --> 16:50.937
You just listen
to what he got to say.

16:54.907 --> 16:56.809
McCONNACLE: Your Honor,
this is an outrage.

16:56.843 --> 16:58.878
Lawrence O'Malley
was acquitted.

16:58.911 --> 17:00.346
The state doesn't like
that result

17:00.379 --> 17:02.949
so they're seeking
to lock him up civilly.

17:02.982 --> 17:04.916
It's a blatant end around
double jeopardy,

17:04.951 --> 17:06.919
not to mention
the constitution,

17:06.953 --> 17:09.255
and it offends every notion
of justice.

17:09.288 --> 17:11.423
SCANNEL: This isn't about
locking him up for a crime.

17:11.458 --> 17:12.492
McCONNACLE: Yes, it is.

17:12.525 --> 17:14.292
And don't offend
my intelligence

17:14.326 --> 17:16.463
or the integrity of this court
by pretending--

17:16.496 --> 17:18.665
If Ms. McConnacle
could climb down

17:18.698 --> 17:19.965
from her soapbox for a second--

17:19.999 --> 17:22.201
McCONNACLE: I have every right
to be on a soapbox.

17:22.233 --> 17:25.304
This is a despicable abuse
of police power.

17:25.972 --> 17:27.839
SPINDLE: I'm inclined to agree,
Mr. Scannel.

17:27.874 --> 17:30.209
You lose
at the criminal proceeding,

17:30.242 --> 17:34.080
so you simply try
to incarcerate him civilly.

17:34.113 --> 17:36.315
That doesn't violate
double jeopardy?

17:36.348 --> 17:38.150
SCANNEL:
He was acquitted of murder.

17:38.184 --> 17:39.185
He nevertheless

17:39.218 --> 17:41.420
professes to be Hannibal Lecter.

17:41.454 --> 17:42.689
He eats people.

17:42.722 --> 17:44.023
How can this court,

17:44.056 --> 17:45.191
or any government institution

17:45.224 --> 17:47.393
that purports
to safeguard the public,

17:47.426 --> 17:48.327
allow him to just--

17:48.360 --> 17:50.129
Has he threatened anybody?

17:50.162 --> 17:51.698
Yes.

17:51.731 --> 17:53.299
His own former lawyers

17:53.332 --> 17:54.333
are afraid of him.

17:54.366 --> 17:55.735
They're here
to give testimony.

17:55.768 --> 17:56.969
McCONNACLE: Let them get
restraining orders

17:57.003 --> 17:58.805
if they feel--
SCANNEL: It's not that simple.

17:58.838 --> 18:00.072
Your client is sick.

18:00.106 --> 18:02.542
McCONNACLE: So let's help
get him treatment then.

18:02.575 --> 18:04.577
You're seeking to throw him
into an asylum

18:04.611 --> 18:05.978
and lock him up.
SPINDLE: All right.

18:06.012 --> 18:08.581
Look, it smells pretty bad,

18:08.615 --> 18:10.249
Mr. Scannel.

18:10.282 --> 18:11.784
The government
didn't even try this

18:11.818 --> 18:12.852
with O. J.

18:12.885 --> 18:15.455
I'd like you to hear
from Lindsay Dole, Your Honor,

18:15.488 --> 18:17.256
and perhaps from some
of Mr. O'Malley's

18:17.289 --> 18:18.290
own doctors.

18:18.324 --> 18:20.259
Those doctors were hired
by the lawyers

18:20.292 --> 18:21.427
for the purpose of building

18:21.461 --> 18:22.762
an insanity defense.

18:22.795 --> 18:24.196
SPINDLE: Okay, Ms. McConnacle.

18:24.230 --> 18:26.232
The court notes your outrage.

18:28.300 --> 18:29.902
Mr. Scannel,

18:29.936 --> 18:31.403
I am not leaning your way,

18:32.839 --> 18:34.441
but I'll let you call
your witnesses.

18:34.474 --> 18:36.075
9:00 tomorrow.

18:36.108 --> 18:38.778
Until then Mr. O'Malley
stays in custody.

18:38.811 --> 18:39.612
We are adjourned.

18:39.646 --> 18:40.713
(gavel bangs)

18:42.181 --> 18:44.050
Clarice.

18:44.083 --> 18:44.717
Lawrence.

18:44.751 --> 18:45.952
What are you doing, Clarice?

18:45.985 --> 18:47.053
Come on, Lawrence.
Don't talk to her.

18:48.087 --> 18:49.456
All right, sir.

18:49.489 --> 18:51.223
(indistinct chatter)

19:12.211 --> 19:13.846
You were with
your brother?

19:13.880 --> 19:15.081
DR. COCHRAN:
Not for the entire evening,

19:15.114 --> 19:16.248
but I was at his apartment

19:16.282 --> 19:18.651
from about 8:30 to 10:00.

19:18.685 --> 19:20.186
That's kind of convenient.

19:20.920 --> 19:22.154
YOUNG: If it is true,

19:22.188 --> 19:23.122
why have you waited until now

19:23.155 --> 19:24.557
to come forward

19:24.591 --> 19:26.125
or why didn't your brother
tell us this?

19:26.659 --> 19:29.261
I'm an oncologist, Mr. Young.

19:29.295 --> 19:31.263
I have a fairly
distinguished career.

19:31.297 --> 19:32.965
I have a family.

19:32.999 --> 19:36.002
If I were to testify
in this trial,

19:36.035 --> 19:39.005
I'm afraid the public
association would...

19:40.673 --> 19:42.909
my brother was respecting
my wishes,

19:42.942 --> 19:45.377
but he now tells me
that he could lose.

19:45.411 --> 19:46.378
And in good conscience,

19:46.412 --> 19:48.848
I can no longer stay silent.

19:48.881 --> 19:50.683
You close to your brother?

19:50.717 --> 19:52.184
Yes, I am.

19:52.218 --> 19:53.786
And you're asking us
to believe

19:53.820 --> 19:55.888
you sat quiet on an alibi

19:55.922 --> 19:57.890
because being associated

19:57.924 --> 19:58.791
with your brother

19:58.825 --> 20:00.092
would hurt your career?

20:00.126 --> 20:01.160
That's correct.

20:01.193 --> 20:02.495
YOUNG: And that your brother
was willing

20:02.529 --> 20:04.196
to let you stay quiet

20:04.230 --> 20:06.265
and face life in prison

20:06.298 --> 20:10.002
rather than blemish
your career?

20:10.036 --> 20:11.671
Wow.

20:11.704 --> 20:13.205
I was at his apartment

20:13.239 --> 20:14.874
between 8:30 and 10:00.

20:14.907 --> 20:16.443
We can't put somebody up there

20:16.476 --> 20:18.244
to commit perjury,
Dr. Cochran.

20:18.277 --> 20:19.479
I won't be committing perjury,

20:19.512 --> 20:20.647
Mr. Berluti.

20:20.680 --> 20:22.815
I was with my brother
from 8:30 to 10:00.

20:22.849 --> 20:25.217
YOUNG: Your brother's semen
was found in the victim.

20:25.251 --> 20:26.318
The DNA proves it.

20:26.352 --> 20:28.387
I'm told the DNA
is inadmissible

20:28.420 --> 20:29.789
and possibly inaccurate.

20:29.822 --> 20:31.123
We're not going to call you.

20:31.157 --> 20:31.891
Why?

20:31.924 --> 20:33.125
YOUNG: Why?

20:33.159 --> 20:34.627
Because if it looks like
you're lying,

20:34.661 --> 20:35.528
which it will,

20:35.562 --> 20:37.797
that'll hurt him.

20:37.830 --> 20:40.166
Well, I'm not a lawyer,
Mr. Young,

20:40.199 --> 20:42.469
but it seems to me
if a witness comes forth

20:42.502 --> 20:44.403
with exculpatory evidence,

20:44.437 --> 20:45.638
evidence which you cannot

20:45.672 --> 20:47.607
establish as being false,

20:47.640 --> 20:49.241
and if the client directs you

20:49.275 --> 20:51.377
to call that witness,

20:51.410 --> 20:53.079
it would be grounds
for malpractice

20:53.112 --> 20:54.781
for you not to do so.

20:57.316 --> 20:59.719
Now, would you like to prep
my testimony

20:59.752 --> 21:03.255
or shall I just meet you
at the courthouse?

21:03.289 --> 21:06.058
(music playing)

21:18.571 --> 21:20.740
DOLE: He would talk about
the book of Genesis

21:20.773 --> 21:23.109
and how by eating the women,

21:24.143 --> 21:25.878
he would become one with them,

21:25.912 --> 21:27.880
and he could take them
to heaven.

21:27.914 --> 21:29.148
SCANNEL: Mr. O'Malley said that?

21:29.181 --> 21:30.917
DOLE: Yes.

21:30.950 --> 21:32.652
And he'd say
how he'd make sure

21:32.685 --> 21:34.854
that I'd go to heaven.

21:34.887 --> 21:36.689
And you interpreted
that to mean?

21:36.723 --> 21:38.591
I was going to die.

21:38.625 --> 21:40.292
And I didn't have
to interpret,

21:40.326 --> 21:41.393
he said so.

21:41.427 --> 21:44.263
He said the other man
was going to get me.

21:44.296 --> 21:46.032
SCANNEL: In the course
of your representation

21:46.065 --> 21:47.399
of Mr. O'Malley,

21:47.434 --> 21:48.768
did you form a lay opinion

21:48.801 --> 21:50.102
as to his mental health?

21:50.136 --> 21:51.838
He's sick and he's dangerous.

21:51.871 --> 21:52.572
He murdered--

21:52.605 --> 21:53.906
McCONNACLE: Objection.

21:53.940 --> 21:55.542
Mr. O'Malley was cleared

21:55.575 --> 21:57.243
of all charges of murder.

21:57.276 --> 21:58.144
DOLE: He's a cannibal.

21:58.177 --> 21:59.612
He thinks
he's Hannibal Lecter,

21:59.646 --> 22:00.480
for God's sake.

22:00.513 --> 22:01.914
He goes after women,

22:01.948 --> 22:05.284
and he has made it clear
that he is coming after me.

22:05.317 --> 22:06.753
He should be locked up.

22:06.786 --> 22:07.920
Ms. Dole,

22:09.989 --> 22:11.157
clearly,

22:11.190 --> 22:13.726
you recognize
how unusual this is

22:13.760 --> 22:15.327
for a lawyer
to be giving testimony

22:15.361 --> 22:17.229
against a former client.

22:17.864 --> 22:19.131
Yes.

22:21.367 --> 22:23.770
Uh, and I've never done
so before.

22:24.837 --> 22:26.405
But I consider this man

22:26.439 --> 22:29.308
to pose an extreme risk
to the public

22:29.341 --> 22:33.012
and I suppose,
particularly to me,

22:33.045 --> 22:37.016
because he consumes women
he has a relationship with.

22:37.049 --> 22:39.351
He seems to believe
he has one

22:39.385 --> 22:41.387
with me.

22:41.754 --> 22:43.255
Thank you, Ms. Dole.

22:49.261 --> 22:50.797
Why are you doing this?

22:50.830 --> 22:53.766
SPINDLE: Mr. O'Malley,
please take your seat.

22:53.800 --> 22:56.436
Your Honor, I prefer to ask
the questions myself.

22:56.469 --> 22:58.905
I don't recommend that,

22:58.938 --> 23:01.173
and since you have
a lawyer here...

23:01.207 --> 23:02.975
O'MALLEY: My lawyer
doesn't know the witness,

23:03.009 --> 23:04.811
I do.

23:04.844 --> 23:07.046
And I believe
it's the right of the accused

23:07.079 --> 23:08.948
to confront my accuser.

23:08.981 --> 23:10.750
SPINDLE:
That's for criminal proceedings.

23:10.783 --> 23:12.619
This is a civil matter.

23:12.652 --> 23:16.656
Again, I will ask you
to please sit.

23:27.033 --> 23:29.969
During the course
of your representation,

23:30.002 --> 23:33.239
at any time did you seek
police protection?

23:33.272 --> 23:34.306
I didn't have to then.

23:34.340 --> 23:36.342
He was in custody,
wearing a muzzle.

23:36.375 --> 23:37.677
Now, he's not.

23:37.710 --> 23:39.612
Well, upon the reading
of the verdict,

23:39.646 --> 23:42.715
he was released
from custody in your presence.

23:42.749 --> 23:43.816
Did you protest?

23:43.850 --> 23:45.084
I should have.

23:45.117 --> 23:46.285
McCONNACLE: But you didn't.

23:46.318 --> 23:49.388
He walked out of the courtroom
while you watched silently,

23:49.421 --> 23:50.490
isn't that right?

23:50.523 --> 23:51.891
DOLE: I think
I was a little stunned

23:51.924 --> 23:53.493
by the not guilty verdict.

23:53.526 --> 23:56.028
Did anything happen
since he was released

23:56.062 --> 23:57.564
to make you scared?

23:57.597 --> 23:58.765
I got a phone call.

23:58.798 --> 23:59.899
McCONNACLE:
From Mr. O'Malley?

23:59.932 --> 24:01.634
I believe
it was him, yes.

24:01.668 --> 24:04.771
Well, did he identify himself?

24:04.804 --> 24:06.405
No.

24:06.439 --> 24:08.708
There was silence
and then a hang-up.

24:08.741 --> 24:11.644
McCONNACLE: Well, why do you
believe it was my client?

24:11.678 --> 24:12.411
I just do.

24:12.445 --> 24:13.713
McCONNACLE: You just do.

24:13.746 --> 24:15.748
Anything else happened
since the verdict?

24:15.782 --> 24:17.950
No.
McCONNACLE: No.

24:17.984 --> 24:21.120
So we are here because you got
an anonymous call

24:21.153 --> 24:24.256
you think came
from Mr. O'Malley?

24:24.290 --> 24:26.693
Did you go to the police
after you got this phone call?

24:26.726 --> 24:28.094
I went to Helen Gamble.

24:28.127 --> 24:29.729
Helen Gamble.

24:29.762 --> 24:32.131
And she took care
of getting my client picked up,

24:32.164 --> 24:34.300
is that correct?
Yes.

24:34.333 --> 24:35.968
McCONNACLE:
She's a close friend.

24:36.002 --> 24:38.004
You and Ms. Gamble
even used to be roommates,

24:38.037 --> 24:38.871
didn't you?

24:38.905 --> 24:39.872
Yes.

24:39.906 --> 24:41.641
Thank you.

24:42.975 --> 24:45.978
(music playing)

24:54.286 --> 24:56.689
YOUNG: It's a little difficult
to believe, sir,

24:56.723 --> 24:59.291
that you'd wait till now
to come forward.

24:59.325 --> 25:00.793
I realize that.

25:00.827 --> 25:02.995
All I can say
is I had my reasons.

25:03.029 --> 25:05.097
The important thing
is I'm here now.

25:05.131 --> 25:06.933
YOUNG: So you went
to your brother's home

25:06.966 --> 25:07.967
around 8:30?

25:08.000 --> 25:09.068
Yes.

25:09.101 --> 25:10.202
We talked for a while,

25:10.236 --> 25:12.204
maybe an hour or so,

25:12.238 --> 25:13.272
and then I left.

25:13.305 --> 25:15.007
YOUNG: After an hour or so?

25:15.041 --> 25:15.942
DR. COCHRAN: Yes.

25:15.975 --> 25:18.911
It was on my way home
that I first saw her.

25:20.079 --> 25:21.013
Saw who?

25:21.047 --> 25:22.281
Her.

25:24.016 --> 25:26.252
She was going
into her apartment building.

25:26.285 --> 25:28.254
YOUNG: Wait a second.

25:28.287 --> 25:30.590
You also saw Ms. Fairbanks
that night?

25:30.623 --> 25:32.158
Yes.

25:32.191 --> 25:33.860
YOUNG: You didn't tell me this.

25:33.893 --> 25:36.162
Well, it's a little difficult
to just come out

25:36.195 --> 25:38.364
with something like that.

25:38.397 --> 25:40.567
I'm still not sure I can.

25:41.100 --> 25:43.102
Come out with what?

25:45.304 --> 25:47.173
That it was me.

25:47.206 --> 25:48.975
That I was the one
who raped her.

25:49.008 --> 25:50.176
Your Honor.

25:51.210 --> 25:53.012
WHITE: We're gonna take
a short recess.

25:53.045 --> 25:55.314
Counsel, chambers.

25:55.347 --> 25:58.350
(music playing)

26:05.758 --> 26:07.760
(door closes)

26:09.128 --> 26:11.163
What? You think I knew
that was coming?

26:11.197 --> 26:13.733
What exactly did he tell you
he planned to say?

26:13.766 --> 26:15.668
Just that he was
with his brother.

26:15.702 --> 26:17.870
Obviously, he didn't tell me
what he really planned to say

26:17.904 --> 26:19.672
because he feared
I wouldn't put him up there

26:19.706 --> 26:20.673
if I knew.

26:20.707 --> 26:22.775
GAMBLE: You have to call
a mistrial.

26:22.809 --> 26:24.243
Double jeopardy. He'll...
GAMBLE: Not when

26:24.276 --> 26:25.612
it's defense misconduct.

26:25.645 --> 26:26.879
We didn't know.

26:26.913 --> 26:29.081
Mr. Young, if I find out
you orchestrated this...

26:29.115 --> 26:30.182
Come on.

26:30.216 --> 26:31.884
It doesn't even help us.

26:31.918 --> 26:35.187
Talk about him having
no credibility before.

26:35.221 --> 26:37.957
Ms. Gamble,
you can either cross him now

26:37.990 --> 26:40.660
or I'll continue the case
and let you investigate.

26:40.693 --> 26:42.261
Your call.

26:43.095 --> 26:45.097
I'd like to be able to argue

26:45.131 --> 26:48.000
that the defendant
was facing the 3-strike law.

26:48.034 --> 26:49.736
What?
GAMBLE: Goes to bias.

26:49.769 --> 26:52.071
It explains why his brother
would lie for him

26:52.104 --> 26:54.173
since he's facing
life imprisonment.

26:54.206 --> 26:56.175
I can't let you
argue that, Ms. Gamble,

26:56.208 --> 26:58.344
and you know it.

27:01.981 --> 27:05.518
GAMBLE: So you just drove by,
saw the victim, and raped her?

27:05.552 --> 27:06.252
DR. COCHRAN: Yes.

27:06.285 --> 27:07.554
Ever rape anyone else?

27:07.587 --> 27:08.621
No.

27:08.655 --> 27:09.889
Ever commit a crime before?

27:09.922 --> 27:10.923
No.

27:10.957 --> 27:12.992
You're an oncologist,
Dr. Cochran?

27:13.025 --> 27:13.993
Yes.

27:14.026 --> 27:14.727
GAMBLE: How much money

27:14.761 --> 27:15.962
do you make annually?

27:15.995 --> 27:18.431
DR. COCHRAN:
A little over $300,000.

27:18.465 --> 27:19.566
Family?

27:19.599 --> 27:21.267
It's because I have a family,

27:21.300 --> 27:22.769
because I have a career.

27:22.802 --> 27:24.571
That's why you raped her?

27:24.604 --> 27:26.639
It's why when my brother
was arrested,

27:26.673 --> 27:27.840
he stayed silent.

27:27.874 --> 27:30.276
He was prepared
to let himself be prosecuted

27:30.309 --> 27:32.011
for something he didn't do

27:32.044 --> 27:34.581
because he didn't want me
to lose all I had.

27:34.614 --> 27:36.716
Oh, I see.
So he was happy

27:36.749 --> 27:38.485
to go to prison for a crime

27:38.518 --> 27:39.652
you committed?

27:39.686 --> 27:41.053
Yes.

27:41.087 --> 27:43.055
Well, he must
really love you.

27:43.089 --> 27:45.224
He does.

27:45.257 --> 27:48.060
He also knows what this will do
to our parents.

27:48.094 --> 27:50.329
I was the one who made it,

27:50.362 --> 27:53.733
the one who finally
made the family proud.

27:54.767 --> 27:56.969
He decided
he'd sacrifice himself.

27:57.003 --> 27:59.839
GAMBLE: So you said
to yourself, sounds good.

27:59.872 --> 28:02.542
I tried to go along with it
for the same reasons,

28:02.575 --> 28:05.778
but ultimately I couldn't.

28:05.812 --> 28:07.947
That's why I'm here today,
to tell the truth.

28:07.980 --> 28:08.915
GAMBLE: So, Doctor,

28:08.948 --> 28:11.684
you know once your brother
is acquitted,

28:11.718 --> 28:12.885
double jeopardy applies,

28:12.919 --> 28:15.221
and he can never
be retried, right?

28:15.254 --> 28:16.489
I'm not a lawyer.

28:16.523 --> 28:17.524
GAMBLE:
You're not a lawyer.

28:17.557 --> 28:21.461
Is it your testimony
that you don't know

28:21.494 --> 28:23.362
once your brother
is acquitted,

28:23.395 --> 28:25.565
he can never be retried?

28:25.598 --> 28:27.667
I know
what double jeopardy is.

28:27.700 --> 28:31.337
GAMBLE: So if he's acquitted
and you get arrested,

28:31.370 --> 28:34.040
he can testify at your trial

28:34.073 --> 28:35.374
that he did it.

28:35.407 --> 28:36.142
Objection!

28:36.175 --> 28:37.644
Overruled.

28:37.677 --> 28:41.047
My brother is innocent.

28:41.080 --> 28:43.415
I'm the one who did it.

28:49.789 --> 28:51.458
YOUNG: I don't like being played
for a fool, Doctor.

28:51.491 --> 28:53.460
If I told you
what I plan to say,

28:53.493 --> 28:54.861
would you have called me
to testify?

28:54.894 --> 28:56.095
If it's the truth, yes.

28:57.196 --> 28:58.698
You don't know
what the truth is, okay?

28:58.731 --> 29:00.266
Well, the jury's gonna know
what the truth is

29:00.299 --> 29:01.200
and I'm telling you better...

29:01.233 --> 29:03.402
You just explain it,
Counsel.

29:03.436 --> 29:05.404
Me and my brother
love each other.

29:05.438 --> 29:07.707
I was willing
to get arrested for rape

29:07.740 --> 29:09.542
rather than let his career
get wrecked.

29:09.576 --> 29:11.744
And when it looked like
I might get convicted,

29:11.778 --> 29:13.245
he came forward to say
what happened.

29:13.279 --> 29:14.514
That was our plan.

29:14.547 --> 29:16.716
And you just sell that, Counsel,

29:16.749 --> 29:18.785
because for all you know,
it could be the truth.

29:18.818 --> 29:19.752
I know it isn't the truth.
That's why I try to...

29:19.786 --> 29:21.954
JERRY:
You just sell it.

29:23.089 --> 29:26.092
(music playing)

29:54.521 --> 29:57.089
What's going on?

29:57.123 --> 30:00.092
First the DNA
and now the twin?

30:02.962 --> 30:05.131
Is he going to get off?

30:06.165 --> 30:07.934
I hope not.

30:10.603 --> 30:12.939
I'm so sorry.

30:12.972 --> 30:15.975
(music playing)

30:42.802 --> 30:44.837
This man is in need of serious

30:44.871 --> 30:46.939
and immediate help.

30:46.973 --> 30:48.240
Stand up, Mr. O'Malley.

30:54.013 --> 30:55.515
You eat people?

30:55.548 --> 30:57.950
Only dead ones,
Your Honor.

30:57.984 --> 31:00.520
I would never harm
a living soul,

31:01.888 --> 31:03.189
never.

31:03.590 --> 31:06.659
SPINDLE: Can you appreciate
how sick it is for you

31:06.693 --> 31:09.195
to consume human flesh?

31:09.228 --> 31:11.431
No one's complained
from PETA.

31:11.464 --> 31:13.633
SPINDLE: You think
this is funny, sir?

31:13.666 --> 31:16.836
Your Honor, I was forced
to stand trial for three murders

31:16.869 --> 31:18.471
I did not commit.

31:18.505 --> 31:19.572
I lost my job,

31:19.606 --> 31:22.041
and will likely
never get it back.

31:22.074 --> 31:23.242
I've had to sit
in a courtroom

31:23.275 --> 31:24.977
listening to people
calling me a monster.

31:25.011 --> 31:27.980
Allow me to find
some gallows humor where I can.

31:28.014 --> 31:30.583
I don't have to allow you
a damn thing,

31:31.584 --> 31:35.555
and if this were truly
a civil commitment hearing,

31:35.588 --> 31:38.791
I would throw you
in the deepest of holes,

31:39.826 --> 31:42.462
but this isn't that,
Mr. Scannel.

31:42.495 --> 31:44.864
It's a pretext.

31:44.897 --> 31:47.099
The Commonwealth failed
at the criminal trial,

31:47.133 --> 31:50.603
so you're trying
to take another whack.

31:50.637 --> 31:52.338
It violates double jeopardy,

31:52.371 --> 31:56.108
it insults the very system
we're sworn to uphold,

31:56.142 --> 31:59.145
and if I were to ever let you
get away with it,

31:59.178 --> 32:02.515
the DAs would be lined up
outside my courtroom door.

32:04.350 --> 32:05.985
The petition is denied.

32:07.119 --> 32:09.456
I am enjoining Mr. O'Malley

32:09.489 --> 32:12.659
from going within 500 yards
of Ms. Dole.

32:12.692 --> 32:15.094
Better pay attention
to that, sir.

32:16.629 --> 32:17.764
We're adjourned.

32:17.797 --> 32:19.599
Are you crazy?
Lindsay.

32:19.632 --> 32:21.901
He's a serial killer,
for God's sake.

32:21.934 --> 32:24.471
As a matter of law,
he isn't, Ms. Dole.

32:24.504 --> 32:25.572
He was acquitted.

32:25.605 --> 32:27.740
Why didn't you take more
witnesses, call the doctors?

32:27.774 --> 32:28.875
DONNELL: Lindsay.
Let go of me.

32:28.908 --> 32:30.710
What happens
if he kills again?

32:30.743 --> 32:32.244
We're adjourned.

32:32.278 --> 32:33.312
DOLE: What's wrong with you?

32:33.345 --> 32:36.148
You wear the robe
to protect the public.

32:36.182 --> 32:37.283
And I wear it

32:37.316 --> 32:41.120
to protect the integrity
of this room, Ms. Dole.

32:41.153 --> 32:43.055
I have made my ruling.

32:43.089 --> 32:46.325
I would advise you
strongly to end it

32:46.358 --> 32:48.661
right now.

32:56.035 --> 32:57.604
Lindsay, come on.
DOLE: Why didn't you call

32:57.637 --> 32:58.871
the doctors?

32:58.905 --> 32:59.772
It wouldn't have mattered.

32:59.806 --> 33:00.773
Of course,
it would have mattered.

33:00.807 --> 33:02.742
They would have testified
that he's insane.

33:02.775 --> 33:03.743
SCANNEL: But his lawyers
would have asked

33:03.776 --> 33:05.912
why they didn't initiate
commitment proceedings?

33:05.945 --> 33:07.146
DONNELL: We at least got
a restraining order

33:07.179 --> 33:08.180
if he tries to pull anything.

33:08.214 --> 33:09.215
SCANNEL: Yeah.

33:15.922 --> 33:17.156
Come near me,

33:17.189 --> 33:18.925
I'll kill you.

33:23.329 --> 33:24.531
DONNELL: Let's go.

33:30.102 --> 33:32.905
GAMBLE: We all know what
is gonna happen next.

33:32.939 --> 33:35.007
If you acquit,

33:35.041 --> 33:38.177
double jeopardy
will reattach,

33:38.210 --> 33:41.514
and the defendant
can never be retried.

33:41.848 --> 33:45.084
What he can do
is take the stand

33:45.117 --> 33:47.386
at the doctor's rape trial,

33:47.419 --> 33:49.355
say he did it,

33:49.388 --> 33:52.258
and gift-wrap reasonable doubt
for the doctor.

33:53.225 --> 33:55.462
Why would these brothers
resort to something

33:55.495 --> 33:57.229
so desperate?

33:57.263 --> 34:00.767
Because the victim saw the man

34:00.800 --> 34:02.334
that raped her.

34:02.368 --> 34:05.772
She positively
identified the defendant

34:05.805 --> 34:07.273
as being that man,

34:08.174 --> 34:11.744
and the defendant
had no alibi.

34:12.745 --> 34:15.347
This grand stunt
was all they had,

34:15.380 --> 34:17.817
never mind how ridiculous.

34:17.850 --> 34:20.753
The evil twin comes forward
under oath to say,

34:20.786 --> 34:22.221
"It was me."

34:23.656 --> 34:25.391
That woman was raped,

34:25.424 --> 34:26.659
almost killed.

34:31.063 --> 34:33.533
This is what
the defendant did to her.

34:38.771 --> 34:41.507
This isn't a game of strategy

34:41.541 --> 34:43.976
and tricks and antics.

34:44.010 --> 34:45.911
She was raped.

34:46.679 --> 34:47.880
I've tried many cases,

34:47.914 --> 34:50.483
and every time
I have asked the jury

34:50.516 --> 34:51.851
to follow the evidence,

34:51.884 --> 34:54.053
which I will do again here.

34:54.085 --> 34:56.456
But for the very first time,

34:56.489 --> 34:58.458
I am going to ask the 12 of you

34:58.491 --> 35:00.827
to follow your hearts.

35:00.860 --> 35:04.931
I believe most people
are fundamentally moral.

35:05.732 --> 35:07.333
And I don't think
it's wrong

35:07.366 --> 35:10.670
for you to let conscience
be one of your guides

35:10.703 --> 35:13.640
as you go back
to that deliberating room.

35:14.641 --> 35:17.577
We all know
who committed this crime.

35:18.778 --> 35:22.615
We know the brother is lying
to save him.

35:23.650 --> 35:24.917
(sighs)

35:28.655 --> 35:31.123
A woman was raped.

35:43.269 --> 35:46.439
Let conscience be
your guide.

35:50.109 --> 35:52.779
This country
has never trusted conscience

35:52.812 --> 35:54.246
as a directional,

35:54.280 --> 35:56.315
and why should we?

35:56.348 --> 35:59.285
In Washington,
even our most noble politicians

35:59.318 --> 36:02.354
sell their opinions
to special interest groups.

36:02.388 --> 36:03.556
They have to.

36:03.590 --> 36:06.392
Without money,
you can't get elected.

36:06.425 --> 36:07.794
Read the papers lately?

36:07.827 --> 36:10.897
You think the Catholic Church
is guided by conscience?

36:11.397 --> 36:13.933
It's exactly
because we don't trust society

36:13.966 --> 36:15.367
to act out of conscience

36:15.401 --> 36:18.838
that we've declared ourselves
a nation of laws.

36:18.871 --> 36:21.808
Laws.
We must follow the law.

36:21.841 --> 36:24.677
Laws are what we have
to prevent anarchy,

36:24.711 --> 36:25.812
and they should be.

36:25.845 --> 36:28.314
Suicide bombers act out
of conscience,

36:28.347 --> 36:29.315
for God's sake.

36:29.348 --> 36:33.052
In America,
we go for the law.

36:34.086 --> 36:36.155
In the criminal-justice system,

36:36.188 --> 36:38.691
the law mandates
that in order to convict,

36:38.725 --> 36:41.093
you must find the accused guilty

36:41.127 --> 36:43.295
beyond all reasonable doubt.

36:43.329 --> 36:45.832
You can't do that here.

36:45.865 --> 36:49.301
The prosecution's entire case
is the victim's ID,

36:49.335 --> 36:51.838
an ID which is highly suspect.

36:51.871 --> 36:54.574
She had no idea
how tall he was.

36:54.607 --> 36:56.676
She said the man
had no facial hair.

36:56.709 --> 36:58.645
My client had a moustache.

36:58.678 --> 37:01.848
She was admittedly in and out
of consciousness

37:01.881 --> 37:03.816
while forming her observation,

37:03.850 --> 37:06.018
and she was also in shock.

37:06.052 --> 37:10.056
Can we trust
what she thinks she saw

37:11.924 --> 37:14.661
beyond all reasonable doubt?

37:17.930 --> 37:19.899
Add to that

37:19.932 --> 37:23.670
another man has come forward
confessing to the crime.

37:23.703 --> 37:25.472
The DA may not believe him.

37:25.505 --> 37:27.774
You might not believe him.

37:27.807 --> 37:30.242
It could be nothing
more than brotherly love,

37:30.276 --> 37:33.480
but that confession
stands unrefuted.

37:34.447 --> 37:36.215
Unrefuted.

37:36.248 --> 37:38.150
Even the victim
can't contradict it,

37:38.184 --> 37:41.554
because that man looks
just like this man,

37:41.588 --> 37:43.823
the one she described.

37:45.424 --> 37:47.259
Follow the law.

37:48.327 --> 37:51.898
But even your conscience
has to tell you here

37:51.931 --> 37:54.300
there's reasonable doubt.

38:04.276 --> 38:05.845
DONNELL: Obviously, if the guy
should ever show up here,

38:05.878 --> 38:07.079
just call the police.

38:07.113 --> 38:08.047
Okay.

38:08.080 --> 38:09.015
Where is Lindsay?

38:09.048 --> 38:09.782
(phone rings)

38:09.816 --> 38:10.683
She's in my office.

38:10.717 --> 38:11.884
I'm gonna take her home.

38:11.918 --> 38:13.720
Well, could you make her take
a couple of days off?

38:13.753 --> 38:15.822
DONNELL: I'm trying,
believe me.

38:15.855 --> 38:17.957
I can't believe this man
is on the street.

38:18.658 --> 38:20.026
(sighs) That was Eugene.

38:20.059 --> 38:21.861
The jury was out 11 minutes.

38:23.095 --> 38:24.631
And they have a verdict?

38:24.664 --> 38:26.599
They just got called back in.

38:26.633 --> 38:28.334
(music playing)

38:42.849 --> 38:44.784
Will the defendant
please rise?

38:47.854 --> 38:50.823
Mr. Foreman,
has the jury reached a verdict?

38:51.290 --> 38:52.492
We have, Your Honor.

38:52.525 --> 38:53.660
What say you?

38:53.693 --> 38:56.128
Commonwealth
vs. Jerry Cochran

38:56.162 --> 38:57.997
on the charge
of aggravated rape,

38:58.030 --> 39:00.800
we find the defendant,
Jerry Cochran,

39:00.833 --> 39:02.401
guilty.

39:02.435 --> 39:05.204
(indistinct chatter)

39:05.237 --> 39:06.839
WHITE: Mr. Cochran

39:06.873 --> 39:07.707
you have been convicted

39:07.740 --> 39:10.042
by a jury of your peers.

39:10.076 --> 39:13.079
Security, take the defendant
into custody.

39:13.746 --> 39:15.214
This matter is now adjourned.

39:15.247 --> 39:16.315
(gavel bangs)

39:18.685 --> 39:21.353
YOUNG: We'll review
whatever grounds we have

39:21.387 --> 39:24.390
and let you know if there
are any possible appeals.

39:24.423 --> 39:26.158
Okay.

39:26.192 --> 39:28.194
(music playing)

39:39.038 --> 39:40.773
Thank you.

39:44.143 --> 39:45.745
Is there a chance for appeal?

39:45.778 --> 39:46.913
I don't know.

39:46.946 --> 39:48.848
An 11-minute deliberation,

39:48.881 --> 39:50.249
it could be good for something.

39:50.282 --> 39:51.651
It's worth raising.

39:51.684 --> 39:53.119
We'll see
what we can figure out.

39:53.720 --> 39:55.387
GAMBLE: Dr. Cochran,

39:55.421 --> 39:57.724
I'd cancel your appointments
for the afternoon.

39:57.757 --> 40:00.860
I'll be sending officers
to arrest you for perjury.

40:02.394 --> 40:03.796
You made a big mistake.

40:07.399 --> 40:08.968
They can't get me on that,
can they?

40:09.001 --> 40:10.302
You lied under oath.

40:10.336 --> 40:11.337
But how can they prove it?

40:11.370 --> 40:13.072
I can just keep
telling them I did it.

40:13.105 --> 40:14.441
YOUNG: That DNA evidence,

40:14.474 --> 40:16.242
it couldn't be used
against your brother,

40:16.275 --> 40:18.745
but it can be used
against you to prove you lied.

40:18.778 --> 40:19.712
DR. COCHRAN: Mr. Young,

40:19.746 --> 40:21.448
Jerry and I
are identical twins.

40:21.481 --> 40:23.415
We have the same DNA.

40:25.585 --> 40:28.621
YOUNG: Still that story's
a little tough to swallow.

40:28.655 --> 40:31.658
Well, if we really
get desperate,

40:31.691 --> 40:32.959
I can just show them
the scar

40:32.992 --> 40:34.794
where she gouged me
with a key.

40:34.827 --> 40:37.830
(music playing)

40:41.033 --> 40:43.135
My brother tried to tell you.

40:43.169 --> 40:45.337
You don't know
what the truth is.

40:58.384 --> 41:00.787
MAN (over TV):
"Boy (indistinct)

41:00.820 --> 41:03.189
that could see Ms. Laura Hunt."

41:03.856 --> 41:05.492
MAN (over TV): (indistinct)

41:05.525 --> 41:07.026
WOMAN (over TV):
Gentlemen, I'm...

41:07.059 --> 41:09.862
DONNELL: You finally
went out after--

41:11.498 --> 41:13.733
or not.

41:13.766 --> 41:15.668
MAN (over TV): I wish
to point out that you caught me

41:15.702 --> 41:17.937
in my most difficult moment.

41:17.970 --> 41:20.540
Ordinarily,
I am not without a heart.

41:20.573 --> 41:22.208
WOMAN (over TV): Really?

41:22.241 --> 41:24.544
(door bell rings)

41:26.579 --> 41:29.549
(music playing)

41:47.166 --> 41:48.435
We need to talk, Clarice.

41:48.468 --> 41:50.236
There's a restraining order.

41:50.269 --> 41:51.438
You just screwed up.

41:54.306 --> 41:55.141
O'MALLEY: No, please.

41:55.174 --> 41:57.477
Don't. Just 30 seconds,
then I'll go.

41:57.510 --> 41:58.244
I swear.

41:58.277 --> 41:59.411
DOLE: Bobby!

41:59.446 --> 42:00.780
Yes, this is an emergency.

42:00.813 --> 42:02.414
There's an intruder
in my house.

42:02.449 --> 42:03.550
What's wrong?

42:03.583 --> 42:04.951
DOLE: His name
is Lawrence O'Malley.

42:04.984 --> 42:06.953
O'MALLEY: I promise, I'm not
here to cause anybody any harm.

42:06.986 --> 42:09.321
I just need to talk
to her, please.

42:10.790 --> 42:11.824
The police are coming.

42:11.858 --> 42:13.793
Just tell me why
you betrayed me, Clarice.

42:13.826 --> 42:14.727
I need to know.

42:14.761 --> 42:16.362
Get out
before I throw you out.

42:17.830 --> 42:19.198
You might get hurt.

42:19.231 --> 42:20.433
Who are you?

42:20.467 --> 42:22.569
You know who I am.

42:25.137 --> 42:27.707
You're in danger, Clarice.

42:27.740 --> 42:29.308
He is coming for you.

42:29.341 --> 42:30.209
DONNELL: Get out.

42:30.242 --> 42:31.478
Only I can save you.

42:31.511 --> 42:33.546
You got two seconds
before I throw you out.

42:33.580 --> 42:35.181
You'll go to heaven,

42:35.214 --> 42:37.249
and I will take you
there myself.

42:38.050 --> 42:39.285
Know what?

42:39.318 --> 42:41.488
Why don't you go on ahead
without me?

42:42.421 --> 42:43.122
(gunshot)

42:43.155 --> 42:44.156
(grunts)

42:44.190 --> 42:45.191
Lindsay!

42:45.224 --> 42:45.958
(gunshots)

42:45.992 --> 42:48.628
O'MALLEY: (grunts)

43:02.174 --> 43:04.110
I told you

43:04.143 --> 43:06.579
I wasn't gonna go
through it again.

43:06.613 --> 43:09.582
(music playing)

43:55.862 --> 43:56.863
WOMAN: You stinker!
