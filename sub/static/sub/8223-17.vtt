05:33.567 --> 05:35.822
Obviously we start with the control, right pressure.

05:36.042 --> 05:38.371
And then we move on to underpressure and overpressure.

we can't go crazy out there.

07:17.378 --> 07:18.788
Okay. Here we go.

supposedly more fuel efficient.

07:50.418 --> 07:52.108
Now, I get the reasoning behind this.

07:52.267 --> 07:53.016
It makes sense. Okay.

07:53.017 --> 07:55.111
You fill your tire to 60 psi

07:55.112 --> 07:56.657
and getting less contact with the road

07:56.811 --> 07:59.206
because the tire is bulging,
less of a footprint there.

07:59.477 --> 08:03.679
You are getting less rolling
resistance and, therefore,

08:03.847 --> 08:04.754
you are possibly getting better fuel efficiency.

08:04.755 --> 08:05.880
That's the theory.

08:06.055 --> 08:07.800
The number crunching will have to wait.

08:07.801 --> 08:10.956
Because on the next two tests,
the guys are working within real

08:11.148 --> 08:15.915
world parameters of 15% above
and below the control.

08:16.755 --> 08:18.004
Feel like we have been here before.

08:18.158 --> 08:19.505
Let's get to the results.

08:19.929 --> 08:20.998
Okay. What have we got?

08:20.999 --> 08:21.597
Okay.

08:21.788 --> 08:26.435
So for the plus 15% overinflated tires at 40 psi,

08:28.222 --> 08:31.237
we consumed 6.2% less fuel.

08:31.238 --> 08:31.903
Makes sense.

08:31.904 --> 08:35.717
In the case of the 15% underinflated at 30 psi

08:35.719 --> 08:40.312
we consumed 1.2% more fuel.

08:40.922 --> 08:44.004
Confirming the myth the
numbers for the extreme

08:44.158 --> 08:45.704
tests are even more extreme.

08:45.867 --> 08:49.476
Basically flat tires increase
friction and, therefore,

08:49.668 --> 08:51.148
increased fuel consumption.

08:51.149 --> 08:53.339
But when it comes to saving money,

08:53.340 --> 08:56.168
the raw numbers don't tell the whole story.

08:56.472 --> 08:57.247
And here's why.

08:57.920 --> 08:59.719
What we are finding with the underinflated tires,

08:59.720 --> 09:01.603
consuming more fuel.

09:01.604 --> 09:03.059
And this makes sense.

09:03.241 --> 09:04.995
When you consider the tire contact patch.

09:05.246 --> 09:08.275
Which is the actual serviurfacet
makes contact with the road.

09:08.485 --> 09:12.211
When the tires are underinflated
the contact is larger.

09:12.476 --> 09:15.967
It increases friction

09:15.968 --> 09:18.852
and makes it harder for the engine to move the car.

09:18.853 --> 09:21.268
If you really break this down to saving money,

09:21.269 --> 09:24.291
well, in a year, drive 10,000 miles

09:24.478 --> 09:26.817
and you are only saving about $76.

09:27.075 --> 09:28.446

09:28.579 --> 09:30.622
you may get a blowout and put your life in danger,

09:30.784 --> 09:32.418
you are not saving anything at all.

11:17.772 --> 11:20.383
Right on cue, our man of action surfaces.

11:20.577 --> 11:21.952
Adam slips out of his dive suit

11:23.486 --> 11:26.207

impression is Agent Hyneman is

11:26.382 --> 11:29.208
not just completely dry in terms

11:29.485 --> 11:30.509

11:31.275 --> 11:33.963

11:34.136 --> 11:34.920
Mightily respectable.

11:35.093 --> 11:36.237

Your suit looks fantastic.

One, a hair weave.

12:58.062 --> 12:58.552
What?

12:58.708 --> 13:00.672
Two, a laptop.

13:01.046 --> 13:02.554
And three, a fridge door.

13:03.060 --> 13:04.188

Thanks to our eagle eye viewer

13:12.028 --> 13:13.230
the team will lock, load

13:13.409 --> 13:17.079

13:17.631 --> 13:19.427
Nine millimeter rounds will they

13:19.777 --> 13:22.785
be stopped stone cold by a fridge?

13:23.121 --> 13:27.523
Is it possible a hair weave
would stop a 45 caliber pistol

13:27.655 --> 13:28.607
dead in its tracks?

13:29.291 --> 13:31.065
Could your laptop really block a

13:31.308 --> 13:34.575
point blank blast from a shotgun?

13:43.777 --> 13:45.038
One of our favorite places to come

13:45.366 --> 13:47.101
and we have all of our targets laid out here.

13:48.006 --> 13:49.518
Laptop cases, wigs, weaves,

13:49.735 --> 13:53.463
laptops, and, of course, the firepower.

13:53.803 --> 13:56.113
Shotgun and a 40 caliber pistol.

13:56.424 --> 13:57.222
This should be a fun day.

13:57.733 --> 14:01.798
First to face the firing squad of truth is the laptop.

14:02.213 --> 14:03.424
Here's Grant with the well

14:04.998 --> 14:07.284
the details of this myth are a little sketchy.

14:07.512 --> 14:09.990
What we do know is it is from four or five years ago.

14:10.422 --> 14:14.106
So we have a best-selling lap
tore from four, five years ago.

14:14.324 --> 14:17.337
Get inside of this average briefcase

14:17.367 --> 14:20.456
we are going to fire at it from three to four feet.

14:20.688 --> 14:21.540
Point blank range.

14:21.831 --> 14:23.373
And if it penetrates this,

14:23.704 --> 14:25.179
it goes into the ballistics gel and

14:25.180 --> 14:27.759
we know that this is not bulletproof.

14:28.848 --> 14:30.141
All right. Ready to load?

14:30.352 --> 14:31.218
Lock and load, baby.

14:31.388 --> 14:32.943
We are about to fire a bird shot

14:33.099 --> 14:34.867
from 12 gauge shotgun into this computer

14:35.107 --> 14:37.885
at point blank range to find out if this is bulletproof.

14:38.263 --> 14:39.062
Fire when ready.

14:40.016 --> 14:41.910
May feeling is we don't have enough space

14:42.130 --> 14:44.097
to allow that shot to spread out.

14:44.271 --> 14:45.945
It will be coming out in one large mass

14:46.185 --> 14:48.883
and I think it will punch a hole right through this computer.

14:49.282 --> 14:53.016
In three, two, one.

14:54.639 --> 14:56.796
Unfortunately for our ballistics gel victim,

14:56.982 --> 15:00.890
Tory's prediction, like Kari's shooting, was dead on.

15:01.385 --> 15:02.675
That went right through the laptop

15:03.027 --> 15:04.998
and destroyed the ballistics gel.

15:05.604 --> 15:06.798
It's not all that surprising.

15:07.275 --> 15:09.379
Laptops are designed to be portable

15:09.582 --> 15:13.489
and most of the components are
fairly lightweight except for one.

15:13.657 --> 15:15.776
Try aiming for the battery.

15:20.442 --> 15:22.547
All right. This time I'm aiming for the battery.

15:23.498 --> 15:26.247
Will that make a difference
to the 12 gauge shotgun?

15:26.560 --> 15:29.426
Firing bird shot at 1,200 feet per second.

15:30.649 --> 15:32.619
In three, two, one.

15:35.676 --> 15:36.557
What? What?

15:36.947 --> 15:37.687
What just happened?

15:38.177 --> 15:39.658
We may have stopped a bird shot.

15:39.932 --> 15:40.471
You are kidding me.

15:40.955 --> 15:42.726
No. No way. No.

15:44.358 --> 15:44.746
Way.

15:44.944 --> 15:48.291
Incredibly in complete contrast to the first test,

15:48.292 --> 15:50.704
the ballistics gel was spared.

15:50.705 --> 15:52.965
There's no exit wounds on the bag.

15:53.142 --> 15:55.516
If you had the computer in the right position

15:55.719 --> 15:57.570
when the guy fired the shotgun you would

15:57.723 --> 15:59.266
probably stop the bird shots.

15:59.477 --> 16:00.286
I will tell you what,

16:00.482 --> 16:02.047
the results from this are extremely surprising.

16:02.170 --> 16:06.519
I mean, we are really close range with a .12
gauge shotgun.

16:07.232 --> 16:09.176
Hits the battery you live.

16:09.513 --> 16:11.910
Knocks the wind out of you
but once you recover,

16:12.082 --> 16:13.814
you need to get up and buy yourself a lottery ticket

16:14.054 --> 16:16.000
because this is a very lucky day for.

16:16.373 --> 16:18.956
Did you if you hit the battery
your computer is bulletproof.

16:19.439 --> 16:20.380
That's incredible.

16:20.784 --> 16:22.269
You have to be incredibly lucky

16:22.457 --> 16:23.551

23:21.075 --> 23:23.554
we are lucky enough to have a few details.

23:23.785 --> 23:25.797
They used a 40 caliber pistol.

23:26.164 --> 23:30.128
We know they shot through the
back window of the driver's side.

23:30.637 --> 23:33.079
So sounds a little crazy to me

23:33.539 --> 23:36.483
but I guess we will see if a hair weave can stop a bullet.

23:37.067 --> 23:40.531
More than the firepower to make it through a windshield,

23:40.933 --> 23:42.994

23:54.912 --> 23:57.806
the all-too damning evidence is discovered.

24:00.324 --> 24:01.773
It actually went through her head

24:02.016 --> 24:04.357

24:12.909 --> 24:15.665
Right here, the bullet goes in through the weave.

24:16.768 --> 24:18.307
You will notice that it pulls

24:18.869 --> 24:20.231
the weave through the head

24:20.483 --> 24:24.389
and brings the weave with the bullet out the other side.

24:24.893 --> 24:26.478
This is very busted.

24:26.666 --> 24:28.063
This is not a bulletproof weave.

This myth seems somewhat suspect to me from the beginning.

24:46.117 --> 24:47.952
If I could ram my finger through the hair weave,

24:48.152 --> 24:52.222
a bullet is going to go through it especially a direct hit.

24:54.810 --> 24:56.800
find a bullet tangled up in her hair.

26:21.481 --> 26:23.225
That's what I'm looking for.

26:24.086 --> 26:27.305
To measure that, I figure we will need to design

26:27.534 --> 26:29.920
some kind of a device that grabs the candy

26:30.279 --> 26:33.746

can put a magnet on it.
