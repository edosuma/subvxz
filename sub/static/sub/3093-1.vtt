00:47.361 --> 00:48.576
was just a dream.

00:48.611 --> 00:50.531
- Angry.
- It was just a dream.

00:50.946 --> 00:53.283
It was just a dream.

00:56.744 --> 00:58.079
His master's voice.

01:17.642 --> 01:20.519
I change, I think
is ready to fill.

01:20.562 --> 01:22.940
Oh my God, that's my department.

01:23.312 --> 01:24.815
Hi sweetie.

01:24.856 --> 01:26.943
Can you make coffee?

01:26.985 --> 01:28.862
Yes, of course.

01:28.904 --> 01:30.741
Hi honey,

01:30.783 --> 01:32.738
wake up, look at the view.

01:51.760 --> 01:54.597
- Have a nice day.
- I love you too.

01:54.639 --> 01:57.431
- Wait... what, what?
- Here.

- Never know.

02:00.560 --> 02:01.854
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

02:01.897 --> 02:02.981
Goodbye.

02:14.157 --> 02:18.038
She did nothing, this happened to you.

02:20.706 --> 02:21.790
We understand .

02:24.418 --> 02:26.336
Can say whatever.

02:26.629 --> 02:28.046
Right? I mean...

02:28.088 --> 02:31.134
It was only once, is a good guy,

02:31.177 --> 02:33.260
was probably my fault.

02:33.553 --> 02:35.263
No.

02:35.763 --> 02:40.145
Your father abused him? What about yours?

02:40.729 --> 02:43.480
Because... It's a cycle,

02:44.315 --> 02:48.199
the abused,
becomes the abuser.

02:48.234 --> 02:52.614
And what I'll do is
help you break that cycle.

02:53.324 --> 02:57.746
're Strong, you can do this.

02:57.787 --> 03:01.208
I know you can do this.

03:04.003 --> 03:07.672
And you, you know what you need
? A rescuer.

03:09.339 --> 03:11.091
Need someone to protect you.

03:11.424 --> 03:12.469
Okay...

03:19.392 --> 03:23.355
This is Walter, is very strong.

03:23.390 --> 03:25.322
Is magical.

03:25.357 --> 03:29.984
And he will not let anyone hurt you.

03:30.609 --> 03:34.407
Never disappoint you.

03:38.496 --> 03:40.207
Thank you.

03:42.248 --> 03:44.377
<i>'s Scared, but all are </ i>.</i>

03:44.544 --> 03:46.213
<i>  The problem is that it is </ i></i>

03:46.248 --> 03:47.137
No, that's fine.

03:47.172 --> 03:51.088
Good job, give me a C53
and I will make everyone happy.

03:51.132 --> 03:52.592
How's everything at La Colina?

03:52.843 --> 03:55.096
- Are wonderful.
- Really?

03:55.139 --> 03:56.890
-
Yes - And the baby?

03:56.931 --> 04:00.516
Jack is sweet, it is wonderful.

04:00.601 --> 04:05.190
- What about Wade?
- It's great, it's great with Jack.

04:05.230 --> 04:05.899
What about your job?

04:06.107 --> 04:09.195
Yes, it is busy, but good.

04:09.236 --> 04:12.282
So why the transition is going well?

04:12.407 --> 04:13.700
Is the transition?

04:14.823 --> 04:17.244
The baby, new home, new responsibilities
,

04:17.279 --> 04:18.786
can be very stressful.

04:21.539 --> 04:23.750
- What are you doing?
- Trying to help.

04:23.790 --> 04:25.210
No, do not,

04:25.752 --> 04:27.296
trying to undermine me.

04:27.713 --> 04:29.214
Long time since our last session.

04:29.255 --> 04:32.884
And you know why?
Would everyone here know it?

04:33.428 --> 04:36.097
- That's basic psychology.
- Still Angry Wade.

04:36.182 --> 04:40.016
- I'm not angry at Wade.
- Good. I do not know what to tell you this way.

04:40.558 --> 04:44.773
I like you and enjoy the time together
,

04:44.813 --> 04:46.316
and I like working with you,

04:46.564 --> 04:48.944
but
keep apologizing for knowing Wade.

04:49.611 --> 04:51.653
I do not like you to try to undermine it.

04:52.821 --> 04:55.410
I can not be your patient more.

04:55.824 --> 04:56.826
Okay?

05:09.965 --> 05:12.926
<i> - Hello.
- How are you doing today my sister </ i></i>

05:14.886 --> 05:16.890
<i> What's up, you do </ i></i>

05:26.814 --> 05:32.119
<i> Yes, I... In fact I expect another call, </ i>.</i>

05:32.154 --> 05:36.784
<i>  - I'm busy.
- Okay, that's fine, of course </ i></i>

05:37.202 --> 05:40.204
<i> You sure you're okay </ i></i>

05:40.746 --> 05:42.915
<i> Yeah, yeah, sure </ i></i>

06:14.240 --> 06:16.282
.?. Hello... How was work today?

06:16.317 --> 06:18.786
Well... you know...

06:20.286 --> 06:22.045
How is my man, where is he?

06:22.080 --> 06:25.626
The man is up,
has been great, it's so sweet.

06:28.630 --> 06:29.716
're So good with him.

06:30.465 --> 06:33.425
It's so easy, I pray to have one like it.

06:37.762 --> 06:40.391
Sure you can tomorrow?
I do not want to take advantage.

06:40.474 --> 06:42.226
Okay, really do not care.

06:42.351 --> 06:43.604
Your parents are okay with this?

06:43.645 --> 06:47.023
You're kidding, are happy that
has not fled to San Francisco.

06:47.058 --> 06:48.024
Right.

06:48.733 --> 06:49.819
- Thanks.
- Yes

06:56.155 --> 06:57.114
- Magnificent.
- Yes

07:09.506 --> 07:12.800
He said he was expecting
another call or something.

07:13.092 --> 07:15.468
What do you think?

07:15.637 --> 07:17.180
I think it carries a time avoiding you.

07:17.222 --> 07:18.730
- As in a while.
- Right?

07:18.765 --> 07:22.184
Yeah?
Has been rare since my mom died.

07:22.225 --> 07:22.602
I mean...

07:22.644 --> 07:26.104
If I had a sister, I
I wanted to be with the baby,

07:26.146 --> 07:27.564
not think we could zoom out.

07:27.647 --> 07:28.522
YES!

07:40.329 --> 07:42.537
It's so weird and scary.

07:42.578 --> 07:44.748
- So rare.
- I know!

07:44.916 --> 07:46.875
Is not it amazing that this alive?

07:47.918 --> 07:49.296
I am very lucky.

07:55.302 --> 07:56.907
By marriage.

07:56.942 --> 07:58.513
For my rescuer.

08:03.688 --> 08:07.521
So, what's going... As Ruth?

08:07.731 --> 08:09.357
- That's another thing.
- What?

08:10.023 --> 08:13.569
Remember I told you that
call home once,

08:13.612 --> 08:15.363
and his father answered and found it weird?

08:15.398 --> 08:16.448
God knows...

08:16.489 --> 08:19.243
Today, she was going out the door,

08:19.286 --> 08:20.579
and note this bruise on his neck.

08:20.744 --> 08:21.662
What do you mean?

08:21.830 --> 08:26.419
I do not know, something about it bothered me.

08:26.461 --> 08:29.462
- How Good acting, she...?
- Okay.

08:31.464 --> 08:33.130
Lo, that worries me.

08:35.299 --> 08:37.886
<i> Being your slave, </ i></i>

08:37.929 --> 08:41.390
I do that most satisfy your desires...

08:42.143 --> 08:44.562
I have no more to spend precious time

08:44.603 --> 08:47.898
or services to do, except
which require.

11:06.833 --> 11:09.629
Jesus... Oh my God,

11:10.502 --> 11:12.129
oh my God, you scared me.

11:12.797 --> 11:16.385
? Wade, Wade...?

11:39.866 --> 11:42.369
- I'm sorry, sorry.
- Jesus.

12:05.311 --> 12:10.481
? Wade, you were hammering?

12:16.071 --> 12:16.906
Are you okay?

12:21.784 --> 12:23.872
<i> Was a woman, </ i></i>

12:23.913 --> 12:27.584
but was beaten,

12:27.666 --> 12:30.717
as beaten, bloody,

12:30.752 --> 12:33.089
As if he could stand.

12:33.132 --> 12:35.216
You sure you were awake
? Totally...

12:35.256 --> 12:38.301
If I knew I was awake,

12:38.760 --> 12:43.806
because, were you hammering?

12:44.057 --> 12:48.605
? Stronghammer?
In the morning sleeping with Jack?

12:49.395 --> 12:50.232
If...

12:51.358 --> 12:54.570
Was sleepwalker? Could that be it?

12:54.778 --> 12:57.948
- I have no idea.
- Because last night...

12:58.990 --> 13:00.158
You were like...

13:00.199 --> 13:01.994
-
Wait... - What?

13:02.029 --> 13:03.789
How lucia women?

13:07.582 --> 13:11.751
Had pale skin, black hair.

13:11.794 --> 13:16.173
And with a striped blouse?

13:19.762 --> 13:20.846
What?

13:26.269 --> 13:30.771
I think it may have been the mother
my dream the other night.

13:37.029 --> 13:39.156
- Is rare.
- Yes, it is.

13:39.782 --> 13:41.200
'll Call you later, okay?

13:41.243 --> 13:41.909
Right.

13:42.118 --> 13:43.660

- I love you too.

13:44.788 --> 13:47.623
- We're good.
- Yeah, I know. Yes

13:47.665 --> 13:48.542
right.

13:48.584 --> 13:50.087
- I love you.
- I love you too.

13:55.255 --> 13:57.509
- Well, goodbye.
- Goodbye.

14:07.394 --> 14:09.689
Hey, here's my favorite guy.

14:10.441 --> 14:12.441
There you go...  Yes

14:15.196 --> 14:17.154
Are you okay? You look a little scared.

14:19.031 --> 14:21.075
That's a good choice of words.

14:22.618 --> 14:24.162
What?

14:25.663 --> 14:27.333
Do you think it's possible?

14:28.250 --> 14:30.126
What
you and Wade are having the same dream?

14:31.085 --> 14:32.837
Yeah, that sounds crazy.

14:34.505 --> 14:37.510
Why? I mean...
On the one hand it shows...

14:37.551 --> 14:39.719
... nearby who are spiritually.

14:39.761 --> 14:41.304
... They even have the same dream.

14:41.889 --> 14:44.474
And on the other side?

14:44.806 --> 14:47.894
According Well... Jesus says,
ghosts do not exist.

14:48.353 --> 14:52.900
Oh, did not know that Jesus had spoken about
ghosts.

14:53.444 --> 14:56.447
When someone dies,
going to Heaven with God,

14:56.482 --> 14:58.323
or face the Final Judgment.

14:59.825 --> 15:00.826
Okay...

15:00.867 --> 15:03.868
So if anyone sees a ghost...

15:03.994 --> 15:08.541
- What you see is a demon.
- A Demon?

15:09.291 --> 15:11.418
Demons can disguise...

15:11.460 --> 15:13.549
... dead people, to confuse us.

15:15.258 --> 15:18.385
Do you believe that, you believe in demons?

15:18.635 --> 15:21.011
If I believe in angels.
I believe in demons.

15:25.181 --> 15:29.061
- How are you?
- Me? I'm fine.

15:29.104 --> 15:29.729
Yeah?

15:29.770 --> 15:32.649
- Things are good at home?
- Yeah, why?

15:32.941 --> 15:34.651
No, for any reason.

15:35.317 --> 15:38.612
So, yes, all is well.

15:38.655 --> 15:41.493
I'm sorry, sorry,
'm nosy, sorry.

15:41.534 --> 15:45.538
No, no... I want to say the job
My Dad has been...

15:46.955 --> 15:48.121
... but that's it.

15:48.204 --> 15:50.084
No, no, no. Sure, that's to be expected.

15:50.208 --> 15:52.586
- So it's been a little...
-... is anxious.

15:52.627 --> 15:55.423
- And my mom also.
-... By stress.

15:55.465 --> 15:56.258
Clear.

15:57.048 --> 16:00.011
But your father...

16:03.180 --> 16:05.475
Demons can take many forms.

16:09.855 --> 16:11.938
<i> - Do you believe in ghosts?
- No. </ i></i>

16:11.981 --> 16:13.859
- Demons?
- I do not know, I do not think so.

16:13.900 --> 16:15.775
Excellent, welcome to the twentieth century.

16:15.943 --> 16:19.656
So, leaving aside the supernatural
,

16:19.697 --> 16:21.573
... you seem to be seeing abused women.

16:21.824 --> 16:23.994
Those may or may not actually be.

16:25.579 --> 16:29.000
I'm not seeing... With Ruth, I see...

16:29.042 --> 16:32.086
If Ruth is being abused, then
come and talk to her.

16:32.128 --> 16:33.380
It can not, by his father.

16:33.422 --> 16:35.214
I tell  and I've said before,

16:35.255 --> 16:38.424
should not advise the
people outside the office.

16:38.467 --> 16:40.842
I saw some bruises on his throat.

16:40.884 --> 16:44.641
We have a system to protect
customers and us.

16:44.681 --> 16:46.434
- Is a matter of credibility.
- I do not understand...

16:46.477 --> 16:50.021
reviews for trying to help a battered woman.

16:50.564 --> 16:52.439
I say, there's a reason why
Center...

16:52.482 --> 16:54.776
... is a psychologist here,
is not just for customers.

16:54.901 --> 16:56.946
Moreover, it is the dream of Wade.

16:57.067 --> 16:58.404
Y Wade do you trust?

17:00.656 --> 17:03.158
- What does that mean?
- It's a simple question.

17:03.199 --> 17:04.992
What does that mean?

17:05.035 --> 17:07.248
He has a dream and you have the same dream
.

17:08.207 --> 17:11.189
You say he's putting ideas in my head
?

17:11.223 --> 17:14.171
- I did not say that.
- And I'm foolish enough to believe that.

17:14.296 --> 17:17.215
- I did not say that.
- I trusted my life to Wade,

17:17.257 --> 17:19.386
and I can not believe you asked me that.

17:19.593 --> 17:21.140
Not know Wade,
you've never known.

17:21.175 --> 17:22.844
Y
the only person I know who tries...

17:22.886 --> 17:24.181
... putting ideas in my head, it's you.

17:24.223 --> 17:25.222
Please... Keep your voice down.

17:25.263 --> 17:28.686
Not think so, I came to you as a friend,
and this is what you're trying to make me.

17:28.727 --> 17:29.728
Trying to help.

17:29.812 --> 17:32.941
No, trying to control myself,
because that's what you do,

17:32.976 --> 17:34.608
y bother you that you can no longer
letting me anymore.

17:35.567 --> 17:37.194
I'm sorry you feel that way.

19:50.666 --> 19:52.127
Wake up, wake up...

19:52.793 --> 19:55.255
're here, here are
are here, come on.

19:55.297 --> 19:56.046
- Come on.
- What?

19:56.087 --> 19:58.090
Up, get up, get up,
get up, get up...

19:58.132 --> 20:00.051
- Fast, arise.
- What is it?

20:00.634 --> 20:03.601
- Come on.
- Please stop.

20:03.636 --> 20:05.931
- Come here, quick.
- What is it?

20:09.475 --> 20:13.522
Wait what happens? Oh damn...

20:16.985 --> 20:17.944
Son...

20:18.360 --> 20:19.864
- This is...
- I know.

20:20.613 --> 20:22.115
-
And that is... - I know, I know.

20:22.782 --> 20:23.867
What do ?

20:42.762 --> 20:44.889
Well, let's go.

20:46.224 --> 20:48.555
- We have to go...
- Stop.

20:58.444 --> 21:00.780
What the hell?

21:03.907 --> 21:07.245
Where is your sister,
where your sister is?

21:09.163 --> 21:13.543
Where is your sister,
where your sister is?

21:32.522 --> 21:35.021
- What is it?
- I do not know, do not know.

21:35.063 --> 21:37.358
- Were in my head...
- I know, I have no idea.

21:37.393 --> 21:37.901
What do ?

21:38.484 --> 21:39.569
No, no, no...

21:39.818 --> 21:42.698
- We have to go.
- Jack is here.

21:52.292 --> 21:53.959
Watch him... I'll see.

21:54.001 --> 21:54.586
Lucy!

21:54.627 --> 21:55.879
No, no... I'll be right back.

21:55.914 --> 21:57.132
- No. ..
- I have to go see.

23:10.579 --> 23:11.914
We have to get out of here,

23:11.955 --> 23:14.791
we will stay with Kate, we have to think
Jack.

23:14.834 --> 23:17.754
No, I do not want that, do not want Kate
I opine me.

23:17.796 --> 23:20.508
- After what happened?
- What happened? Nothing happened.

23:20.551 --> 23:22.467
That was out of my sleep.

23:22.508 --> 23:24.010
No, it was not,

23:24.219 --> 23:26.993
that will not happen to you, and it happened to me,

23:27.028 --> 23:29.767
that's something that happened to them.

23:29.977 --> 23:33.354
Do they, who are they?

23:33.814 --> 23:37.898
They were living in this house
here before us.

23:37.941 --> 23:39.733
- Okay got ghosts?
- Yes

23:40.067 --> 23:44.156
Spirits of dead people, we are
living in a haunted house.

23:44.198 --> 23:46.123
- Demons.
- What?

23:46.158 --> 23:47.286
Ruth thinks are demons.

23:47.912 --> 23:52.625
Where is your sister?...

23:52.959 --> 23:53.956
What?

23:53.999 --> 23:56.292
Father. What
repeated the father. He kept saying it.

23:56.333 --> 23:57.335
Where is your sister?

23:57.751 --> 24:00.171
... Sister was missing,
sister was not there.

24:05.803 --> 24:07.471
The sister survived.

24:08.055 --> 24:09.682
What are you talking about?

24:12.102 --> 24:16.024
Were two daughters, he had four plates
right?

24:16.065 --> 24:18.773
Y repeated where your sister is,
sister was lost.

24:19.066 --> 24:20.527
Sister...

24:21.904 --> 24:24.866
I bet she
still lives in town.

24:25.991 --> 24:29.348
My God, I bet it is a
client.

24:29.383 --> 24:32.706
I bet she is one customer
Center.

24:32.748 --> 24:35.334
- Listen to you at this time.
- Wade, Wade...

24:36.419 --> 24:38.380
- What we have just seen?
- Saw...

24:38.422 --> 24:39.264
What did you see what happened?

24:39.299 --> 24:40.590
- That was my dream.
- No.

24:40.630 --> 24:44.468
No, we saw a family in crisis.

24:46.679 --> 24:48.720
- I can fix this.
- No.

24:48.930 --> 24:52.310
Glen taught me to break the cycle.

24:52.352 --> 24:56.523
... And what we saw was a
family trapped in a cycle.

25:03.028 --> 25:04.613
I can fix this.

25:15.792 --> 25:17.587
I find it strange discuss ghosts.

25:17.671 --> 25:19.880
I saw, saw Wade.

25:19.922 --> 25:21.925
- Wade saw?
- I told you.

25:21.968 --> 25:23.886
- Back to my original question.
- What is that?

25:23.928 --> 25:24.972
Do you trust Wade?

25:25.011 --> 25:27.887
- Are you kidding?
- We talk about ghosts.

25:27.929 --> 25:32.725
I can not, not that I was upset.

25:32.851 --> 25:36.189
Need your help, can you help me
? Want to help?

25:36.605 --> 25:38.609
I want to help, so I think that...

25:38.651 --> 25:41.325
...
regular sessions should start again.

25:41.360 --> 25:43.948
... There has to be me,
if that makes you feel uncomfortable.

25:43.989 --> 25:46.242
're Going through something, obviously.

25:47.325 --> 25:52.078
Speak
that help me with a concrete thing.

25:52.288 --> 25:57.043
Ghosts?
A family of abused ghosts?

25:57.210 --> 25:58.420
And maybe an abused nanny.

25:58.461 --> 26:03.173
No, I speak of a file,
I speak of a woman who came here perhaps.

26:03.208 --> 26:05.596
I say yes
file exists, that's confidential.

26:05.637 --> 26:07.847
It is not my position to give
"Ghostbusters."

26:08.640 --> 26:13.392
Why are you here?
Have an opinion of women,

26:15.354 --> 26:16.736
and you know what?

26:16.771 --> 26:20.235
... I'm almost tell everything to Gale.

26:20.276 --> 26:21.401
And say...

26:21.442 --> 26:24.405
... about you, about us.

26:25.739 --> 26:29.285
So think about it, while looking for that file
.

26:40.213 --> 26:41.339
Mrs. Gold is here.

26:41.374 --> 26:42.048
Great!

26:42.381 --> 26:46.553
Oh Janice, you still know the guy...

26:46.595 --> 26:48.263
... file in the office?

26:48.298 --> 26:49.188
- Phil?
- Yes

26:49.223 --> 26:50.807
Yeah? I need a favor.

26:50.849 --> 26:53.311
- Well, I'll call.
- Great, thanks.

27:03.986 --> 27:04.862
<i> So... </ i></i>

27:05.195 --> 27:08.074
- Glen So, it does not help.
- No, Glen is a dead end.

27:09.033 --> 27:11.163
Still angry break up with him.

27:11.205 --> 27:13.205
And the more angry, more
indifferent, so...

27:16.793 --> 27:19.064
In 1986 David Martel built this house.

27:19.099 --> 27:21.336
Okay, I was married or had children
?

27:21.378 --> 27:24.967
Do not know, do not you find out yet, but if
if you have them.

27:25.007 --> 27:25.682
Why?

27:25.717 --> 27:27.678
Look at this place, has four bedrooms
.

27:27.719 --> 27:28.764
's Huge.

27:29.933 --> 27:33.143
- Okay...
- So, the house was sold,

27:34.269 --> 27:37.313
in 1992, but that's not the interesting part
.

27:37.355 --> 27:38.607
What is the interesting part?

27:39.856 --> 27:43.698
David Martel stopped paying property taxes

27:44.485 --> 27:47.448
and the house did not happen to other people
until 1991

27:47.490 --> 27:49.951
Okay?
Stopped paying property taxes, why?. ..

27:49.993 --> 27:54.790
- Because he was dead.
- Really, you know?

27:55.666 --> 27:57.884
What else could it be? Tell me!

27:57.919 --> 28:00.588
Could have lost work or sick.

28:00.671 --> 28:03.048
-... Or move to Florida.
- Wade, come on!

28:03.090 --> 28:04.217
-
Come... - What?

28:04.260 --> 28:06.553
We saw, you saw them.

28:07.222 --> 28:09.889
This, this, everything fits.

28:09.930 --> 28:12.266
Yes, I saw them, it was.

28:12.308 --> 28:15.686
Lucy, I'm afraid.

28:15.979 --> 28:20.275
Okay? I say we call
Kate and Jack away from here.

28:20.483 --> 28:22.193
No, no, we're not leaving.

28:22.235 --> 28:23.403
There we go!

28:23.445 --> 28:25.533
No we'll take our son with Kate.

28:25.574 --> 28:29.952
Now we have a name, just have to find
sister.

28:36.790 --> 28:39.209
- What is that?
- What?

28:39.244 --> 28:41.629
- On your shoulder?
- What?

28:42.463 --> 28:45.385
- What is that?
- I do not know what you talking about?

28:45.420 --> 28:47.095
Come here, what happened?

28:48.513 --> 28:49.597
What?

28:51.682 --> 28:54.684
My God, someone scratched.

28:56.561 --> 28:58.104
How is that possible?

29:04.571 --> 29:06.114
- My God.
- What?

29:13.746 --> 29:15.874
- What?
- Is anybody out.

33:22.836 --> 33:24.880
Hey, there you are. Where were you?

33:25.673 --> 33:28.093
Were outside, I followed.

33:28.302 --> 33:33.847
Outside? Are you okay?

33:45.612 --> 33:48.699
Only... I could swear,

33:48.738 --> 33:52.119
- I saw you.
- I know. Okay, okay.

33:55.286 --> 33:57.914
Do you think I'm losing my mind?

34:03.337 --> 34:08.050
I believe that this thing, whatever it is that is
is affecting us.

34:09.552 --> 34:11.679
And I think we have to get out of here.

34:13.223 --> 34:17.185
No, I will not do that.

34:18.436 --> 34:22.521
Father will not let me win.

34:26.527 --> 34:27.946
<i> Sorry about yesterday </ i></i>

34:29.447 --> 34:32.074
- I threatened.
- I know, sorry.

34:33.159 --> 34:35.828
You're the only person I can talk
this.

34:35.871 --> 34:38.792
Just give me a formal session and
get to the bottom of this.

34:38.833 --> 34:41.956
- Glen, please.
- Sessions used to help.

34:41.998 --> 34:44.469
If you care about me, for something...

34:44.504 --> 34:46.840
Of course I care, but not
be here.

34:46.875 --> 34:48.175
Glen can you hear me?

34:48.217 --> 34:49.092
That do.

34:50.678 --> 34:53.181
Martel , that was the family name
.

34:53.216 --> 34:54.306
Era Martel.

34:54.349 --> 34:56.809
If anyone in the files or is married
...

34:56.844 --> 34:57.684
Lucy, I told you...

34:57.726 --> 35:00.479
Yeah, I know, but what's in
risk here...

35:00.645 --> 35:03.109
? What's at risk?
Did you even know there's at risk?

35:03.152 --> 35:05.777
I have to find to stop this,

35:05.812 --> 35:07.780
- Lucy.
- To break the cycle.

35:07.862 --> 35:10.156

- Then help me.

35:10.949 --> 35:13.785
Know people,
can find a name.

35:13.825 --> 35:15.744
Doctors, someone in the hospital,

35:15.787 --> 35:17.745
Someone has to know who she is.

35:18.875 --> 35:21.630
Help me, please.

35:31.885 --> 35:35.349
<i> Then there is a man, a woman and a
girl </ i></i>

35:35.391 --> 35:37.685
<i> You and Wade have been seen around the house </ i></i>

35:38.184 --> 35:40.188
<i> Making things. </ i></i>

Yeah, yeah, did you hear something?

35:47.152 --> 35:49.615
<i> Addition to cable television, no </ i></i>

35:50.030 --> 35:52.540
- Seriously...
- Good sister...

35:52.575 --> 35:54.366
<i> I admit I wondered when... </ i></i>

35:54.408 --> 35:56.834
<i>...
your perfect honey moon would end </ i></i>

35:56.869 --> 36:00.417
<i> But I never thought I would

36:00.749 --> 36:04.718
You know Kate, I know your love life

36:04.753 --> 36:10.260
is not what you want, but if you could put
on my side for once.

36:10.845 --> 36:14.097
- Well, that was hard.
- Sorry, sorry.

36:15.138 --> 36:18.351
I'm sorry.
I'm just here in this situation.

36:18.393 --> 36:19.526
You know and...

36:19.561 --> 36:22.147
<i> You talk, you know... </ i></i>

36:22.188 --> 36:27.068
- What?
- You know, as you call...

36:27.109 --> 36:28.988
- A Psychic?
- A Psychic?

36:29.781 --> 36:33.951
<i>  Or whatever they call a paranormal investigator
</ i></i>

36:33.993 --> 36:35.703
Kate, please.

36:35.954 --> 36:37.204
Well, you follow the advice of your...

36:37.245 --> 36:39.790
... crazy nanny worshiper of Jesus,
can not get any worse than that.

36:39.832 --> 36:43.752
I know since you were born, what about me

36:43.794 --> 36:48.215
makes you think a psychic would
get to my house?

36:59.559 --> 37:03.105
Hello, thank you very much for coming
, I'm Lucy.

37:03.272 --> 37:04.941
Hi I am Mara.

37:11.240 --> 37:12.116
It's just...

37:13.033 --> 37:17.080
It is better to go through the house, without any preconceived
, affecting.

38:07.131 --> 38:08.505
This is where...

38:12.469 --> 38:14.430
But the paint was...

38:21.813 --> 38:25.232
An entity
may be tied to a place or a person.

38:26.109 --> 38:28.404
How, follow someone?

38:28.485 --> 38:30.448
Emotion can also be a factor,

38:30.530 --> 38:32.823
an agitated mind,
can raise events.

38:33.365 --> 38:35.242
How are things between you and...?

38:35.828 --> 38:39.371
Wade, Wade is well.

38:40.538 --> 38:41.546
No!

38:41.581 --> 38:44.044
We've been fine until this
...

38:44.084 --> 38:45.961
Anyone else spend much time here?

38:47.715 --> 38:49.886
The Nanny, Ruth.

38:53.011 --> 38:55.387
She's going wrong,

38:55.554 --> 39:01.518
... his father is, do you think Ruth,

39:01.553 --> 39:04.773
-... or Wade, or me?
- Jack O?

39:07.443 --> 39:10.363
- Jack is a boy.
- Jack is a person.

39:10.529 --> 39:12.281
Do you know what that means links?

39:14.701 --> 39:15.919
've Heard the word.

39:15.954 --> 39:19.079
A nexus is a person who draws
him or her paranormal entities.

39:21.373 --> 39:23.499
- Do you think that is Ruth?
- I do not know.

39:24.208 --> 39:26.380
- Jack O?
- I do not know.

39:27.755 --> 39:32.261
Well, what do you think, I have to do?

39:32.636 --> 39:34.054
What do I have here?

39:35.054 --> 39:38.516
Lucy, I feel nothing abnormal
with this house.

39:38.935 --> 39:41.768
And do not say  no experienced anything
,

39:41.977 --> 39:44.231
I just can not feel anything.

39:44.856 --> 39:49.695
I've seen, Wade also seen.

39:49.946 --> 39:51.989
I have no reason to doubt you.

39:52.030 --> 39:56.493
There is a portrait of a man with a hammer
made on my wall.

39:56.618 --> 39:58.620
I'm sure that you can alter.

39:58.662 --> 39:59.705
? Alter?

40:00.080 --> 40:03.837
I have been to many houses and
under many different circumstances.

40:04.165 --> 40:08.214
Not feel anything abnormal.

40:08.838 --> 40:11.050
<i> What can I do </ i></i>

40:11.341 --> 40:14.970
<i> Home, tell them clearly and firmly

40:15.388 --> 40:19.182
<i> they can not harm you or harm anyone

40:32.864 --> 40:36.408
No, I do not think I have tried and come
trys.

40:36.533 --> 40:37.911
Look at the fucking wall.

40:39.787 --> 40:40.923
How could she...

40:40.958 --> 40:43.459
I think she came and gave you,

40:44.001 --> 40:46.252
good advice and
little perspective.

40:46.294 --> 40:47.338
I did not want  perspective!

40:47.755 --> 40:50.506
- I wanted, I wanted...
- Validation?

40:53.303 --> 40:55.137
Do not need validation,

40:55.179 --> 40:58.431
not need it, do you agree
? Me you got me.

41:00.099 --> 41:01.726
Mira. We are in this together.

41:09.487 --> 41:10.528
Can we try?

41:22.124 --> 41:25.670
- What time is it?
- It's 3:00.

41:28.421 --> 41:32.968
Guess that's the time when they are most active.

42:06.544 --> 42:08.087
my son.

42:10.298 --> 42:11.799
If you understand,

42:13.675 --> 42:16.723
please give me a sign.

43:46.689 --> 43:48.733
Wade, get up, get up, get up...

43:49.527 --> 43:51.612
Wade ! Wade!

43:52.153 --> 43:55.116
- What is it?
- Where is your sister?

44:19.014 --> 44:21.183
Was my juice.

45:03.729 --> 45:04.978
What do you want?

45:05.686 --> 45:09.565
He said he wanted to help, right?

45:09.857 --> 45:13.070
-
Yes - then help us.

45:16.574 --> 45:19.744
Can not help, you can not help my wife
,

45:20.787 --> 45:25.669
can not help the girl,
can not help me.

45:26.086 --> 45:27.666
So what do you want...?

45:27.874 --> 45:30.754
I want to break the cycle.

45:33.007 --> 45:34.759
What did your sister?

45:35.176 --> 45:39.388
I said this is ridiculous.

45:39.429 --> 45:42.475
- What did your sister?
- Do I need to call...

45:42.560 --> 45:46.647
- What did your sister!
- Do not know what you want me to say.

45:49.234 --> 45:50.570
How's the baby?

45:51.733 --> 45:55.822
Not allowed to damage it.

45:56.865 --> 46:03.162
... Is not allowed to harm me or my husband,

46:03.999 --> 46:05.542
or my son.

46:08.336 --> 46:10.337
I have to.

46:29.190 --> 46:30.608
- No. ..
- Wait.

46:30.858 --> 46:33.778
Just me, okay, okay.

46:36.491 --> 46:38.115
<i> Do not understand at all </ i></i>

46:38.157 --> 46:41.994
Said what
said her sister? It was very specific.

46:43.245 --> 46:44.588
<i> I said nothing </ i></i>

46:44.623 --> 46:49.668
Kate.
I need your help now, what you told me?

46:50.921 --> 46:52.590
<i> Lucy, this is scaring me </ i></i>

46:52.756 --> 46:58.680
Maybe, maybe before...
You said something about my perfect marriage.

46:59.181 --> 47:00.303
<i> Lucy </ i></i>

47:00.762 --> 47:03.440
No, no, let's talk about that.

47:03.475 --> 47:06.688
Because I know, I know you're jealous of me.

47:06.729 --> 47:07.855
I know!

47:08.273 --> 47:10.941
- Lucy please!
- I know, I know.

47:11.484 --> 47:13.736
... I know you wanted to have a baby and
and...

47:13.779 --> 47:16.029
... You have not met the right type
. But...

47:16.064 --> 47:17.873
<i> Please do not do this </ i></i>

47:17.908 --> 47:21.285
But you asked how your sister now.

47:21.496 --> 47:25.666
<i> If... You know? I need... </ i></i>

47:26.332 --> 47:27.458
<i> gotta go... </ i></i>

47:27.501 --> 47:28.333
What?

47:28.877 --> 47:31.002
What, Kate? Say what?

47:31.045 --> 47:33.756
<i> No. Okay, just, I must go </ i></i>

47:35.259 --> 47:36.052
Kate!

47:39.473 --> 47:42.788
- I'm sorry, sorry to bother you.
- OK.

47:42.823 --> 47:46.104
- I feel so stupid.
- Really okay.

47:46.139 --> 47:49.021
Did not see anyone around the house?

47:50.023 --> 47:53.485
- Now that you mention it...
- What?

47:53.570 --> 47:56.738
A couple of days, I thought
was nothing unusual,

47:56.781 --> 47:58.498
but there was a guy at the house.

47:58.533 --> 48:01.202
- Are you kidding?
- I thought I was a walker or something.

48:01.237 --> 48:03.913
- How does she look?
- Sorry, I was away.

48:03.955 --> 48:06.666
I could not see it, it was just a guy...

48:09.337 --> 48:15.049
I'm sorry, sorry, do not know who you
go or who to trust more.

48:15.633 --> 48:16.850
Want to know what I think?

48:16.885 --> 48:19.220
Yes, I want to know what you think.

48:20.471 --> 48:23.266
In the Church have taught us about demonic possession
.

48:26.936 --> 48:27.688
Okay...

48:29.564 --> 48:32.152
Does
Wade knows things he should not...

48:32.187 --> 48:33.985
... or suddenly speaks Latin, or something?

48:34.027 --> 48:37.529
- No, no, no.
- Or perhaps is super strong.

48:37.570 --> 48:40.492
- No.
- Or speak with another voice.

48:40.527 --> 48:41.161
No.

48:41.536 --> 48:44.538
Have a bite or scratch unusual?

48:47.124 --> 48:50.127
What does that mean, what
means? Is it a demon?

48:50.629 --> 48:52.923
What is a demon, really?

48:54.134 --> 48:56.132
Been
heard about the spirit of Ahab?

48:56.258 --> 48:59.637
? Ahab, as Captain Ahab
in Moby Dick?

48:59.721 --> 49:04.099
Well, the Ahab spirit,
is an ancient demon.

49:04.726 --> 49:08.027
Is very angry and very powerful.

49:08.062 --> 49:12.152
Well,
take any kind of shape or what...

49:12.486 --> 49:14.695
Take the shape you want.

49:15.779 --> 49:16.864
What it does

49:19.364 --> 49:22.869
Destroys families, that's what you want,

49:23.618 --> 49:27.331
takes the soul of the father and
forces destroy his family.

49:30.044 --> 49:34.215
Do not know, do not know if I can accept that.

49:34.883 --> 49:37.342
What you see every day at the Center,

49:37.377 --> 49:38.553
the stories you tell me...

49:39.053 --> 49:39.686
I mean...

49:39.721 --> 49:41.808
A man beats his wife
, hit their children...

49:41.848 --> 49:44.933
get drunk or drugs, rapes his daughter.

49:46.976 --> 49:48.311
Want to break the cycle?

49:49.063 --> 49:50.188
That's what you're up against,

49:50.607 --> 49:52.941
Ahab  spirit
entered in the souls of men,

49:52.984 --> 49:54.486
from the beginning of everything.

49:54.988 --> 49:56.404
That's what you're up against.

49:58.448 --> 50:01.075
- You see that?
- Oh.

50:01.452 --> 50:03.413
God... Okay, I can see
. Can you see?

50:03.620 --> 50:05.621
Of course I see, is my father.

50:06.162 --> 50:07.416
Why are you here?

50:08.083 --> 50:11.128
I think I can be angry,
not tell him to come.

50:12.129 --> 50:13.546
Would you talk to him?

50:13.630 --> 50:16.676
No, I'll do it, all will be well.

50:18.135 --> 50:20.721
- Ruth, where were you?
- Sorry.

50:20.929 --> 50:22.891
- Your mother know you are concerned.
- Sorry.

50:22.932 --> 50:25.644
Ma'am, sorry to bother you, but I have to take
Ruth home.

50:25.679 --> 50:26.769
Hi, I'm Lucy, who are you?

50:27.355 --> 50:29.395
'm Your father, come on... Get in the car.

50:29.430 --> 50:30.946
-
She's 19 - What.?

50:30.981 --> 50:32.691
Not less, not
has to go with you.

50:32.940 --> 50:35.528
- In the car.
- Do not have to go with it.

50:36.195 --> 50:37.197
Sorry Lucy.

50:37.697 --> 50:39.865
Lady incumbent
not really okay?

50:56.590 --> 50:58.802
Calm down, there's no reason to panic
.

50:58.969 --> 51:03.807
Glen, this is real, this is
really going on, do not you understand that?

51:03.849 --> 51:04.684
Lucy!

51:04.726 --> 51:08.437
No. I'm talking to psychics,
I'm talking to my nurse,

51:08.480 --> 51:12.483
y
the only person who does not help me here, is you.

51:12.525 --> 51:15.151
I want to help, I'm helping you.

51:15.275 --> 51:19.032
No. I know you want to do another session.

51:19.072 --> 51:20.491
I would clarify all the confusion.

51:20.657 --> 51:21.992
No. You know what?

51:22.034 --> 51:24.996
There is a portrait of a man with a hammer
on my wall.

51:26.289 --> 51:29.507
My husband, my nanny and I have seen these things
...

51:29.542 --> 51:33.127
... Walking around the house and tell me
it's all in my mind.

51:33.170 --> 51:35.716
I think
session will help you discover the root cause.

51:35.751 --> 51:37.218
No, do not help me find Sister
,

51:37.344 --> 51:41.096
're jealous of Wade or
you try and help me with Ruth.

51:41.178 --> 51:42.345
All you want to hypnotize.

51:42.596 --> 51:44.307
Lucy, you sound hysterical.

51:44.348 --> 51:46.017
You just want to control me!

51:46.059 --> 51:48.853
Just want to control and manipulate.

51:48.896 --> 51:51.981
Because you're a small
and angry man.

51:54.567 --> 51:58.823
I offer a possible solution.

51:58.990 --> 52:03.076
No, what you're trying to do, is try to break
,

52:03.118 --> 52:06.037
and not let you do that.

54:14.256 --> 54:16.507
Jesus, what happened?

54:25.139 --> 54:27.434
<i> Not remember anything </ i></i>

54:29.978 --> 54:34.199
I do not think that was your intention.

54:34.234 --> 54:38.652
Lucy, you know I would never do anything to hurt you
, right?

54:52.542 --> 54:53.836
Well...

55:06.973 --> 55:07.975
Lucy...

55:09.602 --> 55:11.395
Ruth, hello...

55:12.021 --> 55:12.647
Hello.

55:14.274 --> 55:15.609
Is everything okay?

55:15.985 --> 55:18.236
I wanted to ask the same.

55:19.030 --> 55:19.987
Why?

55:20.864 --> 55:22.658
Your father...

55:23.784 --> 55:26.871
No, everything is fine, really. All right.

55:26.913 --> 55:30.041
- You tell me.
- What? Why?

55:30.748 --> 55:33.169
I'm ready for this.

55:34.127 --> 55:37.214
I do not know what you mean.

55:37.257 --> 55:39.716
Do not have to suffer because you are not alone
.

55:39.800 --> 55:41.342
I can help you break the cycle.

55:43.136 --> 55:44.471
Okay...

55:45.098 --> 55:46.642
Look... I should go.

55:46.725 --> 55:50.319
- Your father rapes you...
- What?

55:50.354 --> 55:53.562
I know you've tried to
and tell me I can protect you.

55:53.897 --> 55:57.025
What my father raped me... what do you say?

55:57.359 --> 55:58.903
Do not have to be afraid anymore.

55:59.153 --> 56:01.863
That's disgusting, what's wrong?

56:03.783 --> 56:07.245
Try to help and that's what you thought
all the time.

56:07.413 --> 56:09.791
What kind of person are you?
So you do your job?

56:09.826 --> 56:10.673
No.

56:10.708 --> 56:13.544
You pick random women and invent
nasty things about them.

56:13.628 --> 56:15.125
No, not you, do not do that.

56:15.334 --> 56:18.798
's Because I'm Christian,
that's because you think so,

56:18.840 --> 56:22.136
think yes
someone believes something must be ignorant.

56:22.177 --> 56:23.303
I do not think that.

56:23.679 --> 56:25.681
Please. Do not call more.

56:47.245 --> 56:50.082
A few minutes ago I called Gale.

56:53.377 --> 56:56.464
And he asked me to tell
you're suspended.

56:57.422 --> 56:58.966
I messed up.

56:59.925 --> 57:01.052
Do not concentrate on this.

57:02.385 --> 57:03.805
I do not know what I'm doing.

57:06.640 --> 57:08.142
You going through something.

57:25.951 --> 57:31.540
Want you to look

57:34.042 --> 57:35.671
There is nothing else except the pen.

57:36.629 --> 57:38.338
No more anything except the pen.

57:39.131 --> 57:40.802
Nothing but the pen.

57:42.219 --> 57:47.058
Hear my voice, hear my voice...

I have to do research,

58:13.417 --> 58:15.793
when I give the word
key, I remember everything.

58:15.877 --> 58:16.876
I want you to tell me.

58:16.919 --> 58:19.256
Lucy, I'm helping you,

58:22.135 --> 58:24.761
You might want to call your sister.

58:26.849 --> 58:29.768

- Yes

58:30.059 --> 58:31.937

01:01:53.728 --> 01:01:58.733
- I manipulated.
- Do not manipulate.

01:02:00.026 --> 01:02:02.777
How long ?
From what we broke?

01:02:02.945 --> 01:02:06.364
What have you done to me?
What did you say to Gale?

01:02:06.949 --> 01:02:09.411
- No reason...
- Would you tell us?

01:02:10.953 --> 01:02:15.376
- I still do.
- If you could, yes.

01:02:16.917 --> 01:02:19.714
Then give me the key word!

01:02:20.797 --> 01:02:21.716
When you're ready.

01:02:22.550 --> 01:02:27.721
You were my mentor,
thought you were my friend...

01:02:29.139 --> 01:02:30.389
- Lucy...
- Goodbye.

01:02:31.223 --> 01:02:32.892

01:03:00.172 --> 01:03:01.839

01:03:03.884 --> 01:03:04.926
Do not know.

01:03:12.224 --> 01:03:13.935
Sorry I have been here.

01:03:14.143 --> 01:03:16.604
Okay, me worry.

01:03:19.983 --> 01:03:23.403
You know what? Perhaps this is up.

01:03:23.989 --> 01:03:28.368
- You think I'm crazy?
- No.

01:03:29.119 --> 01:03:31.955
Because'd be crazy too.

01:03:32.455 --> 01:03:36.291

saw the guy the other day.

01:03:36.326 --> 01:03:37.169
I mean...

01:03:37.794 --> 01:03:39.545
Are we all crazy?

01:03:42.840 --> 01:03:44.426
Do not know what to think.

01:03:47.180 --> 01:03:49.556
Lucy, we'll be fine.

01:03:50.432 --> 01:03:51.809
How do you know?

01:03:55.396 --> 01:03:56.563
Because I know,

01:04:03.652 --> 01:04:06.823
will end soon, I promise.

01:04:51.745 --> 01:04:52.621
What?

01:05:03.590 --> 01:05:04.342

I mean, that's, that's...

Came back for me, found me.

01:07:44.383 --> 01:07:48.222
Lucy are only visions right?

01:07:48.551 --> 01:07:52.514
Do not know what they are, or know if they are spirits
,

01:07:52.556 --> 01:07:55.977
... just to see them, and
psychic said it was possible.

01:07:56.018 --> 01:07:58.230
She said that things like that happen.

01:08:01.190 --> 01:08:02.692

01:08:05.364 --> 01:08:08.783
