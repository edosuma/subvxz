WEBVTT

00:01.635 --> 00:04.738
("Sniper at the Gates of Heaven"
by The Black Angels playing)

00:13.447 --> 00:14.415
(Amita screams, Charlie grunts)

00:14.448 --> 00:16.084
Charlie!

00:16.117 --> 00:17.451
Charlie!

00:17.485 --> 00:20.254
- Amita!
- No! No, let me go! No!

00:20.288 --> 00:22.256
Charlie, help me!

00:22.290 --> 00:24.092
(Amita screams)

00:24.125 --> 00:25.526
(vehicle door closes)

00:25.559 --> 00:27.428
(tires squeal)
AMITA: Charlie!

00:31.799 --> 00:33.767
(phone rings)

00:33.801 --> 00:35.769
Hey, buddy.

00:35.803 --> 00:36.804
Blue Jeep...

00:36.837 --> 00:38.439
tinted windows...

00:38.472 --> 00:39.840
The license plate
had an "A-3-3."

00:39.873 --> 00:40.841
Where are you?

00:40.874 --> 00:42.276
Cal Sci parking lot.

00:42.310 --> 00:43.577
They took Amita.

00:43.611 --> 00:45.479
- Blue Jeep.
- What? Are you safe?

00:45.513 --> 00:47.648
Tinted windows.

00:47.681 --> 00:49.183
Charlie?!

00:49.217 --> 00:52.720
Liz, roll campus security,
LAPD and a medic

00:52.753 --> 00:53.921
to Charlie's parking spot.

00:53.954 --> 00:56.690
And also put out an alert
on a blue Jeep, tinted windows,

00:56.724 --> 00:58.492
partial plate A-33.

00:58.526 --> 00:59.693
Just roll.

00:59.727 --> 01:01.729
I want sheriff, every
aerial in the sky.

01:01.762 --> 01:02.730
Just empty out the damn office

01:02.763 --> 01:04.198
and wake up anyone
who isn't here.

01:04.232 --> 01:07.435
(tires screeching)

01:07.468 --> 01:10.704
* How old will you be
when they finally help you? *

01:10.738 --> 01:12.573
WOMAN (over radio): Kidnapping
suspects are in a blue Jeep.

01:12.606 --> 01:15.209
Partial plate: Adam-33.

01:15.243 --> 01:17.111
(siren chirping)

01:17.145 --> 01:20.681
* Don't stop movin',
they're right behind you... *

01:20.714 --> 01:24.585
(garbled radio transmission)

01:24.618 --> 01:25.886
- Hey.
- DON: Hey.

01:25.919 --> 01:27.721
- Hey, what's going on?
- Okay, okay, just relax.

01:27.755 --> 01:29.123
I've got the whole office on it.

01:29.157 --> 01:30.491
- Did you find her?
- What can you tell me?

01:30.524 --> 01:31.659
There were two of them.

01:31.692 --> 01:33.327
They were dressed in black,

01:33.361 --> 01:35.129
uh, masks.

01:35.163 --> 01:36.630
One of them
was definitely a woman.

01:36.664 --> 01:37.631
They hit me.

01:37.665 --> 01:39.367
They hit me with the butt
of a gun, I think.

01:39.400 --> 01:40.834
- Did they say anything?
- No.

01:40.868 --> 01:43.571
Did you get any sense
that maybe you knew them?

01:43.604 --> 01:44.505
No, I called you

01:44.538 --> 01:45.506
while they were leaving.

01:45.539 --> 01:46.507
Given the time frame,

01:46.540 --> 01:48.309
the probability
of a successful area search...

01:48.342 --> 01:49.310
LAPD's in pursuit.

01:49.343 --> 01:50.678
All right.

01:50.711 --> 01:52.613
(sirens wailing)

01:52.646 --> 01:53.914
(tires squealing)

01:53.947 --> 01:55.716
(sirens wailing)

02:04.492 --> 02:05.526
Don, this is Colby.

02:05.559 --> 02:06.894
We're intercepting the pursuit
at Hill and 12th.

02:09.663 --> 02:10.864
(tires squealing)

02:29.250 --> 02:31.319
(tires squealing)

02:47.835 --> 02:49.803
(alarm blaring)

02:56.277 --> 02:58.446
(tires screech)

03:00.881 --> 03:01.882
Amita!

03:02.783 --> 03:04.885
No! No!

03:22.536 --> 03:23.871
I wanted to see her.

03:23.904 --> 03:25.573
You should have let me see her.

03:25.606 --> 03:26.440
We don't know

03:26.474 --> 03:28.442
if she was in the car for sure,
Charlie.

03:29.877 --> 03:30.878
Let's just get you home, okay?

03:30.911 --> 03:31.879
I'm not going home!

03:31.912 --> 03:33.347
I'm going to the FBI!

03:33.381 --> 03:35.549
I'm gonna find out
what happened.

03:35.583 --> 03:36.384
If anyone responsible
for this is out there,

03:36.417 --> 03:38.886
- I'm gonna find them!
- Come here.

03:44.057 --> 03:47.361
Just sit tight
for right now, okay?

03:48.529 --> 03:51.832
(garbled radio transmission)

03:51.865 --> 03:54.001
(sighs)

03:55.669 --> 03:58.372
We got two bodies in the car,
both female.

03:58.406 --> 03:59.473
Beyond that,

03:59.507 --> 04:00.941
it's a morgue question.

04:00.974 --> 04:02.576
They had time to get Amita
out of the car

04:02.610 --> 04:04.312
before LAPD spotted 'em.

04:04.345 --> 04:05.313
Or one of them

04:05.346 --> 04:06.280
could have gotten out.

04:06.314 --> 04:07.315
The techs say
the explosive

04:07.348 --> 04:09.617
was acetone peroxide,

04:09.650 --> 04:11.051
highly volatile.

04:11.084 --> 04:13.787
You bump it or burn it,
it goes off.

04:13.821 --> 04:15.556
DAVID: They call it
"Mother of Satan."

04:15.589 --> 04:17.358
It could be domestic terrorists,
maybe.

04:17.391 --> 04:18.392
Yeah, a car bomb fits

04:18.426 --> 04:19.693
a lot of M.O.s.

04:19.727 --> 04:20.961
Why Amita?

04:22.930 --> 04:23.831
ALAN:
Hey, Charlie...

04:23.864 --> 04:26.367
We got to get some coffee
before we start.

04:26.400 --> 04:27.935
Before we start what?

04:27.968 --> 04:29.603
- Should he be here?
- Stay close, all right?

04:29.637 --> 04:30.838
Don, do we know?

04:30.871 --> 04:32.740
No, nothing for sure.

04:32.773 --> 04:34.342
Okay. Any assistance
I can offer

04:34.375 --> 04:35.909
either with the case
or anything else...

04:35.943 --> 04:38.912
Subject one,
female Caucasian

04:38.946 --> 04:41.549
based on skin samples
grafted to her clothing.

04:41.582 --> 04:43.684
20s, 182 pounds, give or take.

04:43.717 --> 04:45.419
Definitely not Amita.

04:45.453 --> 04:47.855
Subject two,
also female, 20s,

04:47.888 --> 04:52.059
skin sample inconclusive.
Three-months pregnant.

04:52.092 --> 04:53.761
Not Professor Ramanujan.

04:53.794 --> 04:56.063
The right radius has
markings of a shotgun wound

04:56.096 --> 04:58.065
one or two months old.

04:58.098 --> 05:00.067
So unless Professor Ramanujan
has been out duck hunting

05:00.100 --> 05:01.502
with an ex-vice
president...

05:01.535 --> 05:02.770
Got it.

05:02.803 --> 05:05.072
I've got partial
fingerprints on subject two,

05:05.105 --> 05:07.775
and I'm running them both
through DNA databases.

05:15.683 --> 05:17.050
Hey, Charlie.

05:18.519 --> 05:21.422
Hey.

05:21.455 --> 05:23.491
Okay, she wasn't
in the Jeep.

05:23.524 --> 05:25.726
Sure?

05:25.759 --> 05:27.961
Liz just called
from the coroner.

05:27.995 --> 05:30.364
Okay, she wasn't in the Jeep.
She, uh...

05:30.398 --> 05:31.399
Okay, if she's...

05:31.432 --> 05:33.066
if she's not, uh,

05:33.100 --> 05:34.568
then...

05:37.405 --> 05:38.372
We got a fingerprint hit

05:38.406 --> 05:39.973
off of one of the bodies:

05:40.007 --> 05:42.075
It's Irma Rydell.

05:42.109 --> 05:43.444
She has a rap sheet in Iowa:

05:43.477 --> 05:45.379
burglaries, drugs, assault.

05:45.413 --> 05:47.548
DON: Look familiar?
Maybe a student?

05:47.581 --> 05:50.083
- I've never seen her before.
- You sure?

05:50.117 --> 05:51.919
Yeah, I'm sure.

05:51.952 --> 05:54.021
Why did she kidnap Amita?

05:54.054 --> 05:55.689
Well, we're
working on that,

05:55.723 --> 05:58.459
Charlie, but I just need you
to focus here, okay?

05:58.492 --> 06:01.429
- Focus, okay.
- We know Amita was grabbed

06:01.462 --> 06:04.465
at Cal Sci here at 10:48
from your call.

06:04.498 --> 06:05.699
LAPD picked
up the Jeep

06:05.733 --> 06:08.569
here at 12:17.

06:08.602 --> 06:12.473
NIKKI: That's almost 90
minutes to travel 15 miles.

06:12.506 --> 06:15.809
At night, no traffic,
we're talking half hour max.

06:15.843 --> 06:16.810
So they made a stop.

06:16.844 --> 06:18.145
At least one.

06:18.178 --> 06:19.880
DON:
Come on, buddy.

06:21.014 --> 06:22.082
This tells us something,
I know it.

06:22.115 --> 06:24.618
What do you think, Charlie?
Path minimization or...?

06:26.554 --> 06:29.389
Um...

06:31.124 --> 06:33.694
There's not enough bias
for flight and evasion.

06:36.664 --> 06:39.667
It's, it's the same with any...

06:42.503 --> 06:45.205
It's the same
with any Eulerian circuit.

06:45.238 --> 06:47.675
Look...

06:51.579 --> 06:54.782
So the police set up
these roadblocks when?

06:54.815 --> 06:56.116
NIKKI: We were scrambling
off Charlie's call.

06:56.149 --> 06:59.687
Figure a few patrol
cars in the area,

06:59.720 --> 07:01.088
five, ten minutes

07:01.121 --> 07:05.526
to get some more people,
another five for aviation.

07:05.559 --> 07:08.729
You know, the mathematician
John Conway proposed a challenge

07:08.762 --> 07:11.665
called the "angel problem"

07:11.699 --> 07:15.636
in which an angel stands in the
middle of an infinite chessboard

07:15.669 --> 07:18.839
while devils attempt
to block her way.

07:18.872 --> 07:20.574
Now, the angel moves

07:20.608 --> 07:23.577
at a defined rate
from square to square,

07:23.611 --> 07:27.080
but every time she makes a move,
another devil appears

07:27.114 --> 07:29.249
and attempts to block
her movement,

07:29.282 --> 07:33.787
finally winning when the angel
has no square left to land on.

07:33.821 --> 07:35.556
Now, there are strategies

07:35.589 --> 07:38.592
by which this angel can play
indefinitely

07:38.626 --> 07:42.195
and others where the devils
are able to stop her.

07:42.229 --> 07:43.597
This is roughly analogous

07:43.631 --> 07:45.866
to your cordons
and your roadblocks...

07:45.899 --> 07:47.535
We're the devils?

07:47.568 --> 07:49.069
For the purposes of this
particular game theory.

07:49.102 --> 07:53.173
An adaptation of the problem
might infer

07:53.206 --> 07:56.644
probable routes that our angel--
our kidnapper--

07:56.677 --> 07:58.245
could have taken.

07:58.278 --> 08:00.614
Can you do it
without Charlie?

08:01.782 --> 08:04.652
Yeah. I mean,
I don't see why not.

08:04.685 --> 08:06.019
I have rather

08:06.053 --> 08:09.089
always fancied myself
more as a Mycroft

08:09.122 --> 08:10.223
than a Dr. Watson.

08:14.194 --> 08:16.564
You know, I'm not one of those
who always needs

08:16.597 --> 08:18.966
to be running and jumping
and kicking in doors

08:18.999 --> 08:20.100
or anything, but...

08:20.133 --> 08:21.769
Really.

08:21.802 --> 08:23.837
It just seems like we're
wasting our time out here

08:23.871 --> 08:26.640
when we could be,
you know...

08:26.674 --> 08:28.208
Kicking in
a few doors?

08:28.241 --> 08:30.611
EDGERTON: Before you do, you
might want to check this out.

08:31.612 --> 08:32.880
Same boots,

08:32.913 --> 08:34.848
heavy in the toes
like he was squatting.

08:34.882 --> 08:37.918
Staked her office out
three different days, I'd guess.

08:37.951 --> 08:39.787
- Better bag those.
- Good to see you, too,

08:39.820 --> 08:41.555
Edgerton.

08:41.589 --> 08:42.723
What are they?

08:42.756 --> 08:44.224
Eh, beats the hell out of me,

08:44.257 --> 08:46.660
but he's been leaving them
at the last few crime scenes.

08:46.694 --> 08:49.162
You want to tell us

08:49.196 --> 08:50.631
who he is?

08:50.664 --> 08:54.902
Been tracking Mason Duryea
from Oklahoma.

08:54.935 --> 08:57.104
Prison shrink called him
a manipulative sociopath.

08:57.137 --> 08:58.639
I'd go
with crazy,

08:58.672 --> 08:59.973
violent and smart.

09:01.108 --> 09:03.210
Irma Rydell.

09:03.243 --> 09:04.845
As soon as your prints
hit AFIS, I knew my job

09:04.878 --> 09:06.614
- connected up with yours.
- Why is that?

09:06.647 --> 09:07.581
Rydell's husband
did time

09:07.615 --> 09:08.749
with him in Huntsville.

09:08.782 --> 09:09.850
Duryea killed
the husband,

09:09.883 --> 09:11.719
seduced the wife,

09:11.752 --> 09:12.552
and they hit the road together.

09:12.586 --> 09:14.588
I'm pretty sure
your second Jane Doe

09:14.622 --> 09:17.057
is going to be Katie Forman,
a runaway from Barstow.

09:17.090 --> 09:18.726
Told her parents

09:18.759 --> 09:20.127
that Duryea knocked her up.

09:20.160 --> 09:21.361
She's the reason
I jumped his trail

09:21.394 --> 09:23.296
to L.A. in the first place.

09:23.330 --> 09:25.232
He sends his pregnant
girlfriend out driving around

09:25.265 --> 09:27.868
in a car full of explosives?

09:27.901 --> 09:29.903
They're all his girlfriends.

09:29.937 --> 09:32.906
These are just
the ones I've ID'd.

09:32.940 --> 09:34.374
Two others were
arrested trying to rob

09:34.407 --> 09:35.743
a bank in
Montana.

09:35.776 --> 09:37.845
Runaways, drug addicts,
part-time whores--

09:37.878 --> 09:39.079
all female,

09:39.112 --> 09:40.313
- all impressionable.
- Amita doesn't profile

09:40.347 --> 09:41.248
as any of that.

09:42.415 --> 09:44.818
They call themselves a tribe.

09:45.986 --> 09:48.689
Spout half-assed
social revolutionary crap

09:48.722 --> 09:49.690
to justify burglary-murders,

09:49.723 --> 09:51.291
arsons,
robberies.

09:51.324 --> 09:52.325
LIZ:
And the acetone peroxide?

09:52.359 --> 09:53.661
I'd say
he's got

09:53.694 --> 09:54.962
some new ambitions.

09:54.995 --> 09:56.196
Trail went cold
two months ago.

09:56.229 --> 09:58.265
Katie Forman
was my first new lead.

09:58.298 --> 10:00.167
CHARLIE:
What does he want with Amita?

10:01.434 --> 10:03.203
(sighs)

10:03.236 --> 10:04.672
I don't know, Professor.

10:09.710 --> 10:12.379
(panting): Please, if you could
just tell me what it is

10:12.412 --> 10:12.946
that you want.

10:12.980 --> 10:14.014
I want you to be quiet.

10:14.047 --> 10:15.649
Quiet is
important.

10:15.683 --> 10:17.384
You have to make
room for his words.

10:17.417 --> 10:20.788
And we don't need to tell you
not to run, do we?

10:20.821 --> 10:22.756
AMITA: I think you have the
wrong person.

10:22.790 --> 10:23.791
Seriously, I didn't do anything.

10:23.824 --> 10:24.858
I think you have
the wrong person.

10:24.892 --> 10:26.193
- I told you to shut up.
- Please.

10:27.294 --> 10:28.862
No, no, please, no, please.

10:28.896 --> 10:29.797
(squeals)
Go.

10:34.134 --> 10:36.169
(women giggling)

10:53.787 --> 10:55.689
Hello, Amita.

11:05.833 --> 11:08.168
Do I look at you
or look at the camera?

11:08.201 --> 11:10.103
MAN:
Just look at me.

11:11.739 --> 11:13.040
Who are you?

11:13.073 --> 11:14.742
MAN:
The court has appointed...

11:14.775 --> 11:17.177
DURYEA:
The court? Not my court.

11:17.210 --> 11:19.847
Your court, your rules.

11:19.880 --> 11:22.249
Not my rules.

11:22.282 --> 11:24.885
This isn't about sanity.

11:24.918 --> 11:27.955
This is about good and evil.

11:29.389 --> 11:32.960
If a man knows what
he's doing, he's evil.

11:32.993 --> 11:35.395
If he doesn't,
it's not his fault.

11:35.428 --> 11:39.332
Is a coyote insane
because it eats your poodle?

11:39.366 --> 11:43.003
IQ of 155.

11:43.036 --> 11:44.838
Goes to jail a small-time thief,

11:44.872 --> 11:47.374
self-educates
on Nietzsche, Ayn Rand,

11:47.407 --> 11:48.842
Charles Manson.

11:48.876 --> 11:52.212
The women Edgerton
arrested refer to him as

11:52.245 --> 11:55.015
a "political martyr" and
a "spiritual freedom fighter."

11:55.048 --> 11:56.416
Yeah, fighting for what?

11:56.449 --> 11:57.985
You're looking for ways

11:58.018 --> 12:00.453
to... to put me on the cross.

12:02.122 --> 12:06.293
The Pharisees thought
Jesus was crazy... man.

12:06.326 --> 12:08.428
They're gonna crucify me, too.

12:08.461 --> 12:09.997
Just you wait and see.

12:10.030 --> 12:11.131
The Federal Pharisees

12:11.164 --> 12:13.300
hunt me for
bureaucratic sport.

12:13.333 --> 12:15.235
They try to label me,

12:15.268 --> 12:17.137
call me... insane.

12:17.170 --> 12:18.471
Semantics of a society

12:18.505 --> 12:22.242
that props up the weak
and gelds the strong.

12:22.275 --> 12:24.144
You're looking at me.

12:24.177 --> 12:26.246
You're looking through me.

12:26.279 --> 12:27.848
You're wondering why

12:27.881 --> 12:29.749
you're still alive...

12:31.284 --> 12:34.955
...why I stretched out my arm
through time and space

12:34.988 --> 12:36.289
and flexed my
mighty, mighty hand

12:36.323 --> 12:38.091
and tapped you
into service.

12:38.125 --> 12:39.192
You're wondering.

12:39.226 --> 12:40.861
Why Amita?

12:40.894 --> 12:42.830
I'm dialed into
the gestalt...

12:42.863 --> 12:44.865
and you are the gestalt.

12:44.898 --> 12:48.168
Blogs, Web sites.

12:48.201 --> 12:50.170
She got herself a profile
in Wired magazine.

12:50.203 --> 12:53.206
You're the one that
exposed that computer

12:53.240 --> 12:54.341
that pretended
to be human.

12:54.374 --> 12:57.010
No, no, no, no, that wasn't me.
That was somebody else.

12:57.044 --> 12:58.879
You spoke at DEFCON.

12:58.912 --> 13:01.114
A maiden queen
among the hackers...

13:01.148 --> 13:02.482
the outlaws.

13:02.515 --> 13:03.817
(sniffles)

13:03.851 --> 13:05.218
I am a math professor.

13:05.252 --> 13:07.855
You were.

13:07.888 --> 13:09.422
Henceforth,

13:09.456 --> 13:13.226
you are to be my
binary messenger.

13:13.260 --> 13:14.561
(crying)

13:14.594 --> 13:16.429
(wind blowing)
Do you hear that sound?

13:16.463 --> 13:18.198
You think that's the wind?

13:18.231 --> 13:21.134
That's the hounds baying.

13:21.168 --> 13:23.536
Now, I don't have much time
left, so why don't you...

13:23.570 --> 13:26.439
sit your pretty ass down

13:26.473 --> 13:27.507
at the computer

13:27.540 --> 13:29.076
and you listen to me

13:29.109 --> 13:30.810
real, real careful.
(sniffles)

13:37.317 --> 13:40.553
Well, actually,
there is no proven correlation

13:40.587 --> 13:44.224
between... physical proximity
and promptness of result.

13:44.257 --> 13:45.192
What?

13:45.225 --> 13:47.627
It's not gonna go any faster
with you looking

13:47.660 --> 13:50.230
- over his shoulder.
- Will it go any slower?

13:50.263 --> 13:51.298
Uh, probably not.

13:51.331 --> 13:52.565
Uh, where you going?

13:52.599 --> 13:54.134
We...

13:55.268 --> 13:58.238
...are going to the field.

13:58.271 --> 14:00.140
The field.

14:00.173 --> 14:01.341
COLBY:
So, Edgerton says

14:01.374 --> 14:03.243
he's been leaving these
at the crime scenes.

14:03.276 --> 14:05.245
Okay, uh...

14:05.278 --> 14:07.514
maybe this is a notch code
of some kind,

14:07.547 --> 14:10.217
um, used for keys or film...

14:10.250 --> 14:11.018
For film?

14:11.051 --> 14:12.920
Or... Yeah.
Used for sheet film

14:12.953 --> 14:14.187
to identify

14:14.221 --> 14:15.188
brands or emulsions.

14:17.057 --> 14:19.559
That's not likely, but...

14:19.592 --> 14:21.628
they look... familiar.

14:22.562 --> 14:23.530
Hey, man,

14:23.563 --> 14:25.165
just, uh...

14:25.198 --> 14:27.267
just let me know
if you find anything, okay?

14:30.303 --> 14:32.205
CHARLIE:
How many cases

14:32.239 --> 14:33.540
have I helped with?

14:33.573 --> 14:37.277
How many algorithms have
I pulled out of thin air

14:37.310 --> 14:39.546
when I had to?

14:39.579 --> 14:42.015
And now I've got nothing.

14:42.049 --> 14:43.183
(phone rings)

14:45.085 --> 14:46.319
Hello?

14:48.155 --> 14:49.489
- Here.
- No.

14:49.522 --> 14:53.393
No, I haven't, I haven't used
my credit card today.

14:53.426 --> 14:55.228
Well, then someone else must...

14:55.262 --> 14:56.296
Here, let me take it.

14:57.530 --> 14:59.933
Hello?

14:59.967 --> 15:01.168
Yes.

15:03.170 --> 15:04.671
(keyboard clicking)

15:11.044 --> 15:12.545
Is that it?

15:13.680 --> 15:15.248
AMITA:
No.

15:15.282 --> 15:17.050
I'm just testing the firewalls.

15:21.288 --> 15:23.490
You know,
what you're asking me to do

15:23.523 --> 15:25.959
is not
a simple hack, okay?

15:25.993 --> 15:27.260
There are files
and programs

15:27.294 --> 15:29.596
I need to even attempt
something like this.

15:29.629 --> 15:33.333
You don't need to buy time
from me, Amita.

15:33.366 --> 15:35.435
I'm not gonna hurt you.

15:35.468 --> 15:36.703
I need you.

15:36.736 --> 15:38.638
I am not lying to you.

15:38.671 --> 15:40.507
I just want to do

15:40.540 --> 15:43.043
what you want me to do,
and I want to go home.

15:43.076 --> 15:44.211
Now, th-there's

15:44.244 --> 15:46.613
a computer in my office.

15:46.646 --> 15:49.216
If you could get that for me,

15:49.249 --> 15:52.252
that could make this whole thing
go a lot faster.

15:53.420 --> 15:56.756
You know,
I read a story one time...

15:56.789 --> 15:59.292
about this Indian princess.

15:59.326 --> 16:02.729
She gets herself kidnapped
by some demon king.

16:02.762 --> 16:04.431
Ram and Sita.
That's it.

16:04.464 --> 16:07.100
Ram rescues Sita

16:07.134 --> 16:08.368
with the help of Hanuman.

16:08.401 --> 16:09.336
The Monkey King.

16:09.369 --> 16:12.372
Well, here's the thing.

16:12.405 --> 16:14.074
What if I'm the one
that rescued you

16:14.107 --> 16:15.742
from the demon kingdom
of the two-car garage,

16:15.775 --> 16:18.078
800 channels, freeway-bound,

16:18.111 --> 16:19.746
state-supervised
petri dish they call

16:19.779 --> 16:21.448
a free society
and make you eat it?

16:23.583 --> 16:27.220
The story's over, princess.

16:27.254 --> 16:29.189
You've been saved.

16:32.325 --> 16:35.062
Let's see about this laptop.

16:35.095 --> 16:38.365
- Okay, this is our fifth stop.
- All right,

16:38.398 --> 16:41.168
the angel and devils problem
will only yield possible nodes

16:41.201 --> 16:44.404
in places where the movement
and timing of the kidnappers

16:44.437 --> 16:47.107
allows that Amita
might have been taken from

16:47.140 --> 16:47.907
that first vehicle.

16:47.940 --> 16:48.941
This is the best possibility
yet.

16:48.975 --> 16:52.345
Isolated, no streetlights--
lot of places they

16:52.379 --> 16:53.546
could be hiding her.

16:53.580 --> 16:55.448
EDGERTON: Or places where they
had a second car waiting.

16:55.482 --> 16:56.649
You always

16:56.683 --> 16:58.418
got to make your
appearance like that?

16:58.451 --> 17:01.788
People just don't seem
to notice me until I talk.

17:01.821 --> 17:03.356
So I'm assuming
your own process

17:03.390 --> 17:04.591
brought you to this same spot.

17:04.624 --> 17:06.326
Started backtracking
the Jeep's

17:06.359 --> 17:07.794
skid marks from the crash site.

17:07.827 --> 17:08.561
NIKKI:
Through downtown L.A.?

17:08.595 --> 17:10.363
Tires on asphalt,

17:10.397 --> 17:11.498
footprints in the grass,
same principle.

17:11.531 --> 17:13.333
They were taking
a lot of hard corners--

17:13.366 --> 17:14.367
made it considerably easier.

17:14.401 --> 17:17.404
I left the door open
around back-- come on in.

17:20.840 --> 17:23.510
LIZ:
I don't like what I'm seeing

17:23.543 --> 17:24.411
inside this guy's head.

17:28.581 --> 17:30.550
It's radiator fluid.

17:30.583 --> 17:32.552
Something must've been
parked there a while.

17:32.585 --> 17:33.553
EDGERTON:
Four doors.

17:33.586 --> 17:36.156
Maybe an Impala.

17:36.189 --> 17:38.325
Tire tracks will not be
as easy to follow.

17:39.459 --> 17:41.161
Here, check this out.

17:45.198 --> 17:46.299
(sniffs)

17:46.333 --> 17:48.501
Acetone peroxide.

17:48.535 --> 17:50.637
A bomb lab. Figure they didn't
snatch

17:50.670 --> 17:52.172
Dr. Ramanujan
until they were finished

17:52.205 --> 17:53.640
with what they
were finished with in here.

17:53.673 --> 17:55.308
LARRY:
These parts.

17:55.342 --> 17:57.344
EDGERTON: Yeah, I ran a check--
this place has been

17:57.377 --> 17:58.445
in Chapter 11 for six months.

17:58.478 --> 17:59.746
No one would have known
they were here.

17:59.779 --> 18:01.681
Arms...

18:01.714 --> 18:04.317
legs, heads.

18:04.351 --> 18:06.419
No torsos.

18:06.453 --> 18:08.288
You know, I'd really like
to meet that guy

18:08.321 --> 18:09.356
who was using
your credit card number.

18:09.389 --> 18:11.524
I mean, if you're going
to steal, why steal junk?

18:11.558 --> 18:13.226
- What?
- Yeah, a clock and a teapot,

18:13.260 --> 18:14.794
I can sort of get, but, uh,

18:14.827 --> 18:17.264
who in Los Angeles
is going to need a snowboard?

18:17.297 --> 18:19.599
And $275 for
a snow globe?

18:23.603 --> 18:26.606
Wrap me up in a prison jumpsuit
to define me,

18:26.639 --> 18:29.442
wrap yourself up in a suit
and tie to define you.

18:29.476 --> 18:30.743
Strip away the suit and tie,

18:30.777 --> 18:33.413
don't think I don't know
what you are.

18:33.446 --> 18:36.216
You're a dog...

18:36.249 --> 18:39.286
sniffing through the puke
and garbage.

18:39.319 --> 18:40.653
Hey, she's alive.

18:40.687 --> 18:42.555
She's... she's
communicating with me.

18:42.589 --> 18:43.356
What?

18:43.390 --> 18:44.424
There were four fraudulent
charges

18:44.457 --> 18:45.658
that were made on my
credit card: a mantel clock.

18:45.692 --> 18:48.928
Uh, it's the same exact one
I bought her for her birthday.

18:48.961 --> 18:50.897
A brass stacking
teapot set.

18:50.930 --> 18:54.267
That was... that was her
parents' graduation gift to her.

18:54.301 --> 18:56.836
A snow globe, a snowboard.

18:56.869 --> 18:59.206
I bought those for our trip
to Colorado.

18:59.239 --> 19:00.473
Okay, but I don't understand.

19:00.507 --> 19:01.774
I don't know how

19:01.808 --> 19:03.276
she's doing this
exactly,

19:03.310 --> 19:05.178
but there's no way
it's a coincidence.

19:05.212 --> 19:06.813
She's talking to me.

19:06.846 --> 19:10.250
These four things
are in her office.

19:10.283 --> 19:12.919
She wants us
to watch her office.

19:15.288 --> 19:17.857
COLBY: So, Amita talking to
Charlie in secret code.

19:17.890 --> 19:19.226
What do you think?

19:19.259 --> 19:20.327
DAVID: That, if I was in
Charlie's place,

19:20.360 --> 19:22.262
I would be grasping
at straws, too.

19:24.297 --> 19:26.666
But, you know, on
the other hand...

19:26.699 --> 19:27.934
Yeah.

19:29.702 --> 19:31.638
You think that's what's going on
with Don, too?

19:31.671 --> 19:33.306
I mean, he just keeps watching

19:33.340 --> 19:35.408
Duryea's psych interviews
over and over.

19:35.442 --> 19:37.544
You got to figure that
he's on to something.

19:37.577 --> 19:38.911
(vehicle approaching)

19:41.248 --> 19:42.249
Hey.

19:42.282 --> 19:44.251
One o'clock.

19:55.862 --> 19:57.264
Yeah, here we go.

19:57.297 --> 19:58.465
Piper St. Joan.

19:58.498 --> 19:59.666
(sighs)

19:59.699 --> 20:01.768
Why do we ever
waste any time

20:01.801 --> 20:02.969
doubting Charlie?

20:30.297 --> 20:31.030
FBI!

20:31.063 --> 20:33.366
(gunfire)

20:36.736 --> 20:38.438
She's dead.

20:38.471 --> 20:39.672
So is your stooge.

20:39.706 --> 20:41.240
She's as good as dead.

20:54.020 --> 20:58.358
(keyboard clicking)

21:11.338 --> 21:13.005
Going somewhere?

21:13.039 --> 21:15.007
I have to go
to the bathroom.

21:15.041 --> 21:16.343
Uh-huh.

21:16.376 --> 21:17.544
Audrey.

21:18.978 --> 21:20.980
Show Amita to
the bathroom.

21:21.013 --> 21:22.949
And show her the way back, too.

21:27.687 --> 21:29.922
You will have to kill me
before that ever happens.

21:33.092 --> 21:35.962
A lot of things
happen before we die.

21:41.501 --> 21:42.402
Off you go.

21:49.476 --> 21:50.843
(door opening)

21:52.745 --> 21:54.947
PIPER:
Zombie with the gun.

21:54.981 --> 21:56.949
Waiting for words
that will never come.

21:56.983 --> 21:59.018
COLBY:
You mentioned that already.

21:59.051 --> 22:03.856
In the car, during processing,
and in the elevator.

22:03.890 --> 22:06.058
Mason says the devil
will come with credentials.

22:09.829 --> 22:11.364
Mason tried to kill you.

22:11.398 --> 22:12.565
Dallas tried to kill me.

22:12.599 --> 22:14.033
She's always
been jealous

22:14.066 --> 22:18.371
of my position
at his right hand.

22:18.405 --> 22:20.039
What was the laptop for?

22:20.072 --> 22:21.408
Bitch asked for it.

22:21.441 --> 22:23.410
I knew she was a bitch,

22:23.443 --> 22:27.414
but Mason, he said no, she's,
she's a member of the tribe,

22:27.447 --> 22:30.450
even if she hasn't
taken her place yet.

22:32.552 --> 22:33.853
So, Mason makes mistakes.

22:39.025 --> 22:41.428
They're all pieces.

22:41.461 --> 22:44.997
And Mason sees the pieces
as a whole.

22:45.031 --> 22:48.968
Bitch is as good as dead
when he finds out.

22:49.001 --> 22:52.138
All right,
the "bitch" is my friend

22:52.171 --> 22:55.975
and she has a name.

22:56.008 --> 22:57.944
Mm.

22:57.977 --> 23:00.947
Friend of a zombie with a gun.

23:00.980 --> 23:02.682
There's a surprise.

23:04.016 --> 23:05.151
I'm gonna take a shot
in the box.

23:05.184 --> 23:06.185
No, no, no, no.

23:06.218 --> 23:07.754
I want her to focus on Colby.

23:09.188 --> 23:11.891
I just wish we had
a shortcut into her head.

23:11.924 --> 23:13.059
We do.

23:13.092 --> 23:14.694
His head.

23:14.727 --> 23:15.928
DURYEA (on video):
Well, congratulations.

23:15.962 --> 23:16.896
(claps)

23:18.030 --> 23:19.065
(chuckles)

23:19.098 --> 23:21.434
DON:
Hey.

23:21.468 --> 23:22.669
So?

23:22.702 --> 23:24.804
I mean, it's going
to take some time.

23:24.837 --> 23:26.606
Are you kidding me?

23:26.639 --> 23:29.075
Are you?

23:29.108 --> 23:30.943
We're doing everything we can.
I hope you know that.

23:30.977 --> 23:33.780
I know if it was your girlfriend
out there, you would be doing...

23:33.813 --> 23:35.047
Bouncing off the walls.
I'd be swinging at anything

23:35.081 --> 23:36.716
that got in my way.

23:36.749 --> 23:38.150
I'd be tearing down the city.

23:38.184 --> 23:39.952
You don't think I haven't put
myself in your shoes

23:39.986 --> 23:42.722
about every two minutes
since this happened?

23:42.755 --> 23:45.758
I'm keeping a clear head
for you and Amita.

23:45.792 --> 23:46.959
That's how we're going
to get her home.

23:49.929 --> 23:52.098
Any luck with this stuff?

23:52.131 --> 23:53.199
I've got a head full
of possibilities,

23:53.232 --> 23:55.668
and I can't zero in
on a single one.

23:55.702 --> 23:58.037
So, don't. Don't do it.
You don't have to.

23:58.070 --> 24:00.907
Look, I've seen this happen
to you over and over again.

24:00.940 --> 24:01.874
The stress gets
too close to home,

24:01.908 --> 24:04.110
and you don't see straight.
You check out.

24:05.244 --> 24:07.680
So, what do I do now?

24:07.714 --> 24:09.115
Go to your gut.

24:21.127 --> 24:22.962
So, they kidnap Amita, all
right, they bring her back to

24:22.995 --> 24:24.997
their bomb lab.
Full of mannequin parts.

24:25.031 --> 24:26.733
Yeah, they're packed up here,
moving on

24:26.766 --> 24:28.167
to a probably
harder to find lab.

24:28.200 --> 24:29.902
They hand off Amita.

24:29.936 --> 24:31.638
Then try to dump the kidnap
vehicle because Duryea doesn't

24:31.671 --> 24:33.606
- want to leave the Jeep here.
- And he doesn't want us

24:33.640 --> 24:34.607
to know what
he's up to.

24:34.641 --> 24:37.043
In Gaza, they use
mannequins as booby traps.

24:37.076 --> 24:40.146
Load them up with explosives,
sucker the soldiers in.

24:40.179 --> 24:43.015
And no torsos.
It's like a puzzle

24:43.049 --> 24:44.584
with the largest pieces missing.

24:44.617 --> 24:46.185
He leaves wood carvings
at crime scenes,

24:46.218 --> 24:47.720
kind of like limbs.

24:47.754 --> 24:49.889
So, he wanted us to find this?

24:49.922 --> 24:51.157
Or not.

24:51.190 --> 24:52.124
Or he didn't care.

25:00.232 --> 25:02.001
Let me ask you something.

25:02.034 --> 25:05.872
Did you really pay $275

25:05.905 --> 25:07.707
for a snow globe?

25:07.740 --> 25:08.708
What?

25:08.741 --> 25:09.942
Snow globe.

25:09.976 --> 25:12.278
No, I paid ten bucks for it.

25:12.311 --> 25:14.647
I bought it at a, uh...

25:15.782 --> 25:17.149
I paid cash for it.

25:17.183 --> 25:19.686
Three dollars
for an antique Indian tea set,

25:19.719 --> 25:22.789
60 cents for a snowboard,
and my personal favorite,

25:22.822 --> 25:26.292
28 cents for an art deco
mantel clock.

25:27.827 --> 25:28.795
Farmers' American Credit says

25:28.828 --> 25:30.296
that none of these charges
actually happened.

25:30.329 --> 25:31.297
Amita hacked
into their server

25:31.330 --> 25:35.067
and wrote those charges
directly into your bill.

25:35.101 --> 25:37.103
I think that
she's working

25:37.136 --> 25:40.172
on that level that you, her and
Larry do when the rest of us

25:40.206 --> 25:41.440
are standing around
with our hands

25:41.473 --> 25:44.911
in our pockets, waiting to be
pointed in the right direction.

25:44.944 --> 25:46.779
So, come on.

25:46.813 --> 25:48.047
Maybe when Larry gets back...

25:48.080 --> 25:49.281
No, no, Charlie,
she is not talking to Larry.

25:49.315 --> 25:51.283
She is talking to you.
Those things,

25:51.317 --> 25:52.985
those are memories
about the two of you.

25:53.019 --> 25:54.887
They're numbers.

25:54.921 --> 25:56.155
And they don't mean
anything to me.

25:56.188 --> 25:57.690
- No?
- No.

26:06.298 --> 26:07.299
Oh, my God.

26:19.111 --> 26:21.948
It's a 32 bit IPv4 address.

26:21.981 --> 26:23.282
IPv as in Internet?

26:23.315 --> 26:24.651
Private network.

26:24.684 --> 26:26.252
It's Amita's private network.

26:38.798 --> 26:41.133
Oh, she's so amazing.

26:42.234 --> 26:44.003
Come on, Charlie.

26:44.036 --> 26:45.337
It's a mirror IP address.

26:45.371 --> 26:47.139
She's letting us watch
what she's doing

26:47.173 --> 26:48.741
in real time

26:48.775 --> 26:50.910
right under his nose.

26:55.748 --> 26:57.850
It's not drugged.

26:57.884 --> 26:59.986
That glazed look on your face
is just love?

27:00.019 --> 27:02.889
There's a lot
of love here.

27:02.922 --> 27:06.025
Tribal love.

27:06.058 --> 27:08.828
The way men and women
are supposed to be.

27:08.861 --> 27:10.863
DURYEA: You're part of something
big, Amita.

27:10.897 --> 27:13.966
You just don't know it yet.

27:16.035 --> 27:18.738
Once the message is out,
you'll see that.

27:22.108 --> 27:24.276
You making
progress, Amita?

27:24.310 --> 27:27.246
Uh, uh, yeah, actually,
it's coming along.

27:28.748 --> 27:30.216
Uh-huh?

27:33.953 --> 27:36.255
Even without
your laptop?

27:38.224 --> 27:40.727
Do not make that
mistake, Amita.

27:40.760 --> 27:42.361
Just cause your zeros and ones
don't mean that much to me

27:42.394 --> 27:43.863
doesn't mean I can't add.

27:43.896 --> 27:46.332
Okay.

27:46.365 --> 27:48.835
A betrayal
was expected.

27:48.868 --> 27:50.737
- No, I...
- Part of the dance.

27:50.770 --> 27:52.972
No, I didn't. I...

27:53.005 --> 27:54.373
Well, how long has
it been now, Amita?

27:54.406 --> 27:57.276
How long?

27:57.309 --> 28:00.446
The hounds aren't
baying yet.

28:00.479 --> 28:02.715
Piper and Dallas, they're
in jail or they're dead.

28:02.749 --> 28:04.316
No. No.

28:04.350 --> 28:05.451
You don't know that.

28:05.484 --> 28:06.719
They knew the price they'd have

28:06.753 --> 28:08.955
to pay, and they took the risk
purely 'cause I asked them to.

28:08.988 --> 28:11.891
That's the love of the family,
the tribe.

28:11.924 --> 28:13.125
Okay.

28:13.159 --> 28:15.094
And what I'm asking
you to do right now...

28:17.496 --> 28:19.431
...is eat.

28:24.003 --> 28:26.038
Here.

28:31.377 --> 28:33.780
Good.

28:36.082 --> 28:37.349
It's all right.

28:40.452 --> 28:41.821
(grunts)

28:41.854 --> 28:44.023
(Amita crying)

28:44.056 --> 28:45.758
I forgive you.

28:45.792 --> 28:47.760
CHARLIE:
She's writing a cyber attack

28:47.794 --> 28:49.395
on Farmers' American Credit's

28:49.428 --> 28:51.497
main servers,
which is how she got to

28:51.530 --> 28:53.232
my credit card
under Duryea's nose.

28:53.265 --> 28:55.067
Because it looks like
what it was--

28:55.101 --> 28:56.402
an attack on their firewalls.

28:56.435 --> 28:57.436
DAVID:
Can she really hack

28:57.469 --> 28:58.437
Farmers' American Credit?

28:58.470 --> 28:59.671
Probably not, no.

28:59.705 --> 29:02.274
No, the IP address she sent me
sent me to a dummy Web site.

29:02.308 --> 29:05.177
I think she wants me to
help her fake an attack.

29:05.211 --> 29:07.246
DAVID: Techs are trying to back
trace from the address

29:07.279 --> 29:09.281
to a server,
but it could take hours.

29:09.315 --> 29:10.249
I mean, if they're stealing
Internet, we might not

29:10.282 --> 29:12.084
even be able to get more
than a neighborhood.

29:12.118 --> 29:13.452
Well, it's not
about the credit cards.

29:13.485 --> 29:14.821
You know,
that's not who this guy is.

29:14.854 --> 29:16.155
CHARLIE:
Farmers' American Credit

29:16.188 --> 29:18.524
carries 15% of this country's
credit card debt.

29:18.557 --> 29:20.559
Do you realize, if
one could get in...

29:20.592 --> 29:22.261
It is a burr.

29:24.396 --> 29:25.531
Larry, that's,
uh, evidence.

29:25.564 --> 29:26.465
LARRY:
And

29:26.498 --> 29:28.000
it is also a puzzle.

29:28.034 --> 29:31.337
Six piece puzzles
date from the 1800s.

29:31.370 --> 29:33.272
And when assembled,
they take the form

29:33.305 --> 29:34.540
of a seed burr.

29:34.573 --> 29:36.375
CHARLIE: Bill Cutler proved that
there are

29:36.408 --> 29:38.310
25 possible notchable pieces

29:38.344 --> 29:40.813
to make solid six-piece burrs,
and they can be assembled

29:40.847 --> 29:43.049
314 ways.

29:43.082 --> 29:46.452
Each burr is a key piece.
Now, you pull that out...

29:46.485 --> 29:47.519
whole thing falls apart.

29:47.553 --> 29:49.121
DAVID:
Well, you said

29:49.155 --> 29:50.222
Farmers'
American Credit--

29:50.256 --> 29:51.457
they have 15%

29:51.490 --> 29:53.225
of the country's
credit card debt?

29:53.259 --> 29:55.127
$451 billion.

29:55.161 --> 29:58.164
Even a day or two off-line--
you could send tremors

29:58.197 --> 29:59.465
through this economy.

30:03.870 --> 30:06.438
The weak have to protect
themselves from the strong.

30:06.472 --> 30:09.041
That's why you have
to take our teeth out,

30:09.075 --> 30:10.509
crush our spirit.

30:10.542 --> 30:12.378
That's the construct
you're serving.

30:14.446 --> 30:16.182
Remove the weak link,

30:16.215 --> 30:17.984
and the whole machine

30:18.017 --> 30:22.221
breaks apart, and then...

30:22.254 --> 30:25.424
only then can it truly
come together as a whole.

30:28.995 --> 30:31.497
Mason ever talk to
you about these?

30:32.598 --> 30:34.400
Sure he did.

30:34.433 --> 30:37.103
I mean, everything he says,
he says over and over.

30:37.136 --> 30:38.437
"Remove

30:38.470 --> 30:40.572
"the weak link,

30:40.606 --> 30:43.375
and the machine
breaks apart."

30:47.013 --> 30:48.915
You're the weak link.

30:51.083 --> 30:53.085
He replaced you.

30:53.119 --> 30:54.520
Amita is the new piece.

30:54.553 --> 30:56.588
You lying,

30:56.622 --> 30:58.590
pig-faced bastard!

30:58.624 --> 31:00.326
He sent you

31:00.359 --> 31:01.593
to get caught.

31:01.627 --> 31:04.430
He sent you to betray him.

31:04.463 --> 31:08.234
He will burn this place to
the ground to get me back!

31:08.267 --> 31:10.002
He-he will... He will

31:10.036 --> 31:12.171
scoop out your eyeballs
and spit in the sockets!

31:12.204 --> 31:13.472
You don't get it.

31:13.505 --> 31:15.574
I am the Pharisee.

31:15.607 --> 31:17.476
Forked tongue!
Forked tongue.

31:17.509 --> 31:20.479
He left you behind
to lead me to him.

31:20.512 --> 31:23.282
That is your piece
in the puzzle.

31:28.554 --> 31:30.556
You think
you're going to save her?

31:31.690 --> 31:33.425
You're not.

31:36.128 --> 31:37.629
(chains clank)

31:37.663 --> 31:39.565
But I'll send you into hell.

31:41.367 --> 31:43.502
I'll draw you a map.

32:09.628 --> 32:13.465
*

32:17.036 --> 32:18.537
(gunfire)

32:22.108 --> 32:23.109
DON:
Team one is taking fire

32:23.142 --> 32:24.243
from the two side.

32:24.276 --> 32:26.478
Team two, give me a sitrep here.

32:28.314 --> 32:29.481
They got this side covered.

32:33.019 --> 32:34.620
I guess Piper gave us
the right address.

32:34.653 --> 32:36.322
Stand fast, everyone.

32:36.355 --> 32:38.390
Guys, get a command van
set up out there.

32:40.759 --> 32:42.428
(screams)

32:42.461 --> 32:44.196
(shell casings clinking)

32:44.230 --> 32:46.132
One down.

32:47.333 --> 32:48.367
Mason,

32:48.400 --> 32:49.768
they killed Hope.

32:49.801 --> 32:51.770
Calm down.
Remember the plan.

32:51.803 --> 32:53.405
Everything like
I told you.

32:53.439 --> 32:55.641
AMITA:
Plan?

32:55.674 --> 32:57.209
It's over.

32:57.243 --> 32:59.445
Oh, you think
you were picked at random?

33:00.812 --> 33:02.514
You think your relationship

33:02.548 --> 33:04.350
with the FBI
was some coincidence?

33:04.383 --> 33:07.053
You wanted them to find me?

33:07.086 --> 33:09.721
DURYEA: You don't make history
in the shadows, Amita.

33:09.755 --> 33:12.358
You strike your definitive blow

33:12.391 --> 33:14.260
in the coliseum

33:14.293 --> 33:16.362
while the crowd
looks on and cheers.

33:16.395 --> 33:19.065
We don't have
much time.

33:19.098 --> 33:22.201
If you can't destroy
the Farmers' American

33:22.234 --> 33:24.336
Credit servers before
the doors fall...

33:25.404 --> 33:26.605
...you'll die along with us.

33:33.445 --> 33:33.745
(gunshot)

33:38.417 --> 33:41.220
*

34:06.612 --> 34:08.447
(gunfire)

34:08.480 --> 34:10.849
(explosions)

34:10.882 --> 34:12.351
Liz?

34:12.384 --> 34:13.419
LIZ:
No casualties.

34:13.452 --> 34:17.156
And tell Edgerton he was right
about the dummies.

34:17.189 --> 34:17.956
Looks like the yard

34:17.989 --> 34:19.191
is booby-trapped
with these things.

34:19.225 --> 34:20.359
DON:
All right.

34:20.392 --> 34:21.593
Fall back and wait for my next.

34:21.627 --> 34:22.694
David, throw it.

34:22.728 --> 34:26.832
(gunfire)

34:26.865 --> 34:29.368
Do you hear that?

34:29.401 --> 34:32.204
That's the sound of the coliseum
rising up around us.

34:32.238 --> 34:34.473
It's almost time
to face down the lions.

34:34.506 --> 34:36.742
(gunfire continues)

34:38.877 --> 34:41.247
Ian?

34:42.548 --> 34:44.783
They went for the throw phone.

34:46.452 --> 34:47.619
They're also moving more
of those bombs

34:47.653 --> 34:48.554
in front of the windows.

34:49.855 --> 34:51.523
Mason.

34:53.525 --> 34:55.694
Duryea is blocked by a bomb
and Amita.

34:55.727 --> 34:56.895
Can't risk another shot.

34:56.928 --> 34:58.164
All right.

34:59.431 --> 35:00.432
We're covered
on all four quadrants.

35:00.466 --> 35:01.467
Bomb squad's
on its way.

35:01.500 --> 35:03.235
Charlie?

35:03.269 --> 35:04.503
The dummy site's almost up.

35:04.536 --> 35:06.172
(phone ringing)

35:07.739 --> 35:10.176
I've accepted
your phone, and I've

35:10.209 --> 35:12.278
- demonstrated my position.
- All right, well,

35:12.311 --> 35:13.545
I'd like to speak
to Dr. Ramanujan.

35:13.579 --> 35:15.347
Yeah, she's a bit busy
right now.

35:15.381 --> 35:16.448
All right, so how about

35:16.482 --> 35:17.483
we talk about what you want?

35:17.516 --> 35:18.550
I want 15 minutes.

35:18.584 --> 35:19.918
What?

35:19.951 --> 35:22.388
I said I want 15 minutes!

35:24.190 --> 35:25.791
I am nowhere near ready.

35:25.824 --> 35:27.259
You can't buy time
I'm not selling.

35:27.293 --> 35:29.595
What do you think,
that this is a magic trick?

35:29.628 --> 35:31.763
That I can just run my fingers
over a few keys

35:31.797 --> 35:34.566
and crash one of the most
secure databases in the world?

35:34.600 --> 35:37.436
All I know
is you got 15 minutes,

35:37.469 --> 35:39.205
'cause that
is all I gave you!

35:39.238 --> 35:40.806
Now turn around

35:40.839 --> 35:42.908
and get your fingers on these
keys before I break them off!

35:45.544 --> 35:46.445
15 minutes.

35:46.478 --> 35:48.180
You think he's going to blow
himself up?

35:48.214 --> 35:49.315
DON:
No.

35:49.348 --> 35:50.749
- Not this guy.
- LARRY: Hey, Don,

35:50.782 --> 35:53.852
the way he's arranged the yard,
it seems to me

35:53.885 --> 35:55.554
it's almost like a burr puzzle.

35:55.587 --> 35:57.489
Well, if it
is a burr,

35:57.523 --> 36:00.559
- there is a key piece.
- A safe route.

36:00.592 --> 36:01.393
Here.

36:04.996 --> 36:06.532
All right, Colby,
you're with me.

36:06.565 --> 36:08.467
Nikki, you got
the phone.

36:25.584 --> 36:28.487
*

36:40.666 --> 36:43.469
(gunfire)

36:46.705 --> 36:48.774
(gunfire continues)

36:52.678 --> 36:54.380
WOMAN:
They're right outside.

36:54.413 --> 36:55.481
DURYEA:
All right, load up.

36:55.514 --> 36:56.548
Stand behind the bombs.

36:58.049 --> 36:59.585
All right, hold your fire,
hold your fire.

37:00.819 --> 37:02.688
(gun clicking)

37:02.721 --> 37:05.023
Ian?

37:05.056 --> 37:06.925
No shot.

37:06.958 --> 37:09.928
Do it now.

37:09.961 --> 37:12.264
CHARLIE: Trying to anticipate
Amita's programming.

37:12.298 --> 37:14.533
Charlie, she is talking to you.

37:14.566 --> 37:17.235
All I want to do is talk back.

37:18.370 --> 37:19.338
Hey.

37:19.371 --> 37:20.339
Hey, Nikki.

37:20.372 --> 37:22.374
Hey, get Ian on the radio.

37:22.408 --> 37:23.875
Hey, Ian.

37:23.909 --> 37:24.876
CHARLIE:
Okay.

37:24.910 --> 37:26.812
Okay.

37:26.845 --> 37:29.548
(beeping)

37:29.581 --> 37:31.016
- Is that it?
- Is it happening?

37:31.049 --> 37:33.285
It's wiping out
everyone's accounts.

37:34.720 --> 37:36.288
Can they stop it?

37:37.889 --> 37:39.291
No.

37:39.325 --> 37:40.292
All right, let them in.

37:40.326 --> 37:41.927
- What?
- We're done here.

37:41.960 --> 37:44.763
Done? They're going to take us
to jail, separate us.

37:44.796 --> 37:46.498
Jail is just the beginning.

37:47.633 --> 37:49.468
What I done...

37:49.501 --> 37:52.037
what I done is...
is Madoff...

37:52.070 --> 37:53.539
Enron, AIG

37:53.572 --> 37:56.708
ten times over
and blood and thunder!

37:56.742 --> 37:58.977
They're going to write books,
sing songs.

38:00.612 --> 38:03.482
Hell, they'll make T-shirts.

38:04.650 --> 38:05.951
AUDREY:
Hope died for you.

38:05.984 --> 38:09.321
Michelle died for you.

38:09.355 --> 38:10.589
No, they died for
the message, Audrey.

38:11.790 --> 38:13.325
AMITA:
Yeah.

38:13.359 --> 38:15.661
The message on T-shirts.

38:17.663 --> 38:19.531
(gun clicks,
computer warbles and beeps)

38:21.800 --> 38:23.569
(panting)

38:23.602 --> 38:24.670
(gunshot)

38:24.703 --> 38:26.104
(groans)

38:26.137 --> 38:28.640
(shell clanking)

38:28.674 --> 38:29.608
(gunshot)

38:36.147 --> 38:38.617
DON (muffled):
Amita.

38:38.650 --> 38:40.619
Amita.

38:42.854 --> 38:44.122
- You okay, sweetie?
- You hit?

38:44.155 --> 38:45.391
Stay right here.

38:45.424 --> 38:46.558
DON:
Huh, huh?

38:46.592 --> 38:47.793
Come here, I got
you, there you go.

38:47.826 --> 38:50.729
- You all right?
- AMITA: Yeah, I'm okay.

38:50.762 --> 38:52.664
(handcuffs clicking)

38:55.834 --> 38:57.403
My book will be called

38:57.436 --> 38:59.137
Two Days
with a Computer Illiterate!

38:59.170 --> 39:00.606
DON:
All right.

39:05.744 --> 39:06.978
Thanks, Don.

39:25.831 --> 39:27.733
*

39:45.717 --> 39:47.453
DAVID: You know when you get
that feeling

39:47.486 --> 39:48.820
that you've
been up so long

39:48.854 --> 39:50.188
you can't remember
how to be tired?

39:50.221 --> 39:52.691
I think it's going to
come right back to me.

39:52.724 --> 39:54.860
I feel so energized.

39:54.893 --> 39:56.528
I mean, contrasted
with a discipline

39:56.562 --> 39:57.763
where results
are measured

39:57.796 --> 39:59.865
in microns
and light years,

39:59.898 --> 40:02.868
there's just such immediacy
to this work.

40:02.901 --> 40:05.571
- On the good days.
- LIZ: To the good days.

40:07.506 --> 40:09.040
Hey, papers are on your desk,
Mini-Don.

40:09.074 --> 40:11.477
- I'm out.
- Are you guys grabbing a beer?

40:11.510 --> 40:12.511
Give me five
minutes

40:12.544 --> 40:13.779
- to get changed.
- Yeah...

40:13.812 --> 40:15.614
Um... no.

40:19.918 --> 40:21.019
COLBY:
That one,

40:21.052 --> 40:22.053
I did not see coming.

40:22.087 --> 40:22.921
LIZ:
I know.

40:22.954 --> 40:25.757
I always thought
he had his eyes on you.

40:25.791 --> 40:27.993
(laughter)

40:28.026 --> 40:29.461
Okay. While I'm
completely comfortable

40:29.495 --> 40:30.762
with that line of humor...

40:30.796 --> 40:31.863
LARRY: You're expressing said
comfort

40:31.897 --> 40:34.700
with a novel shade of crimson.

40:34.733 --> 40:36.868
(laughter)

40:38.003 --> 40:39.437
DON:
What a week.

40:40.772 --> 40:42.708
ALAN:
Yeah... what a year.

40:42.741 --> 40:44.242
You get stabbed.

40:44.275 --> 40:47.145
Charlie gets shot at.

40:47.178 --> 40:49.815
You both nearly
lose your jobs.

40:49.848 --> 40:52.818
And if I was
to inventory it, it...

40:52.851 --> 40:54.920
you got your
train crashes,

40:54.953 --> 40:56.187
your escaped convicts,

40:56.221 --> 40:58.757
your serial killers,
bank robbers.

40:58.790 --> 41:01.793
"People work so hard at living,
they forget how to live."

41:02.928 --> 41:03.428
Talmud?

41:03.461 --> 41:04.362
(chuckling):
No.

41:04.395 --> 41:07.098
Gary Cooper,
Mr. Deeds Goes to Town.

41:07.132 --> 41:08.634
Talmud's got some good
stuff, too, though.

41:08.667 --> 41:10.569
Yeah.

41:10.602 --> 41:14.005
You know, after
I got hurt...

41:14.039 --> 41:16.808
I started
wondering about...

41:16.842 --> 41:18.777
the-the whole
spiritual journey.

41:18.810 --> 41:22.548
Was it just a joke
with a bad punch line?

41:22.581 --> 41:24.950
You know, God's way of
telling me he doesn't exist?

41:24.983 --> 41:26.818
So, what did you decide?

41:26.852 --> 41:28.620
I don't know if you ever decide.

41:28.654 --> 41:30.522
I went back to work.

41:30.556 --> 41:31.690
Charlie needed me and...

41:31.723 --> 41:34.826
Robin, David, Colby.

41:34.860 --> 41:36.795
- Amita needed me.
- Yeah.

41:36.828 --> 41:39.097
And Nikki always needs someone
looking out after her.

41:39.130 --> 41:40.198
(chuckling)

41:40.231 --> 41:42.968
People need me.

41:43.001 --> 41:44.903
And sometimes I forget that.

41:44.936 --> 41:47.205
Then, life reminds me.

41:49.007 --> 41:50.976
You know why Amita's alive?

41:51.009 --> 41:52.944
'Cause you picked
up Charlie's phone,

41:52.978 --> 41:55.781
talked to some
credit card company.

41:55.814 --> 41:58.917
I was just...
doing what I do.

41:58.950 --> 42:00.218
Yeah, being there.

42:00.251 --> 42:02.187
That's exactly what
I'm trying to say.

42:03.955 --> 42:06.057
Whatever God is...

42:06.091 --> 42:10.028
I'm pretty sure it's in how
we're there for each other.

42:11.763 --> 42:15.200
AMITA: You know, all I could
think about...

42:15.233 --> 42:18.036
all I knew is that
you would find me.

42:18.069 --> 42:19.871
Well, you believed
in me more than I

42:19.905 --> 42:22.073
believed in myself.

42:22.107 --> 42:24.009
Yeah, well, that's how
it's supposed to be.

42:25.677 --> 42:28.880
You know what this...
this whole year

42:28.914 --> 42:30.849
has made
crystal clear to me?

42:32.884 --> 42:35.286
You have no idea what your life

42:35.320 --> 42:37.589
is going to look like
five years from now,

42:37.623 --> 42:39.725
or one year
from now,

42:39.758 --> 42:40.826
or a week.

42:42.794 --> 42:44.830
It all turns on a dime.

42:46.965 --> 42:48.867
And the things that matter...

42:48.900 --> 42:51.136
* When things start splitting
at the seams... *

42:51.169 --> 42:52.804
...you don't want
to turn around

42:52.838 --> 42:54.205
and realize
you've lost them...

42:55.340 --> 42:57.709
...while you
were waiting.

42:57.743 --> 43:00.946
* And now...

43:00.979 --> 43:02.948
You know
I love you so much.

43:02.981 --> 43:04.349
I love you, too.

43:04.382 --> 43:07.085
* And now
it's tumbling down... *

43:07.118 --> 43:09.087
Amita...

43:09.120 --> 43:12.758
* Hard...

43:12.791 --> 43:15.727
...will you marry me?

43:15.761 --> 43:18.730
* And no one

43:18.764 --> 43:23.635
* Is ever gonna love you
more than I do *

43:25.804 --> 43:30.108
* No one's gonna love you
more than I do. *
