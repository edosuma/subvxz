01:36.974 --> 01:39.637
Murdoch, what the bloody
hell are you doing?

01:39.667 --> 01:41.257
Ah. I'm working on...

01:41.287 --> 01:43.394
An idea that's been floating
around the skull of yours...

01:43.431 --> 01:44.534
Yes, I know.

01:45.101 --> 01:46.620
Actually, it's something
I've been thinking about

01:46.638 --> 01:49.577
ever since the rowing
club murders. It's a...

01:50.528 --> 01:52.840
well, essentially, it's
a new source of light.

01:52.870 --> 01:55.581
And the old source of light
we had wasn't good enough?

01:56.386 --> 01:57.790
Allow me to demonstrate.

01:57.820 --> 01:59.204
Please switch off the lamp.

02:00.651 --> 02:03.427
Right. Now, I turn on the light source.

02:04.232 --> 02:05.444
Impressive.

02:06.688 --> 02:07.467
Look.

02:07.503 --> 02:09.003
Look at my fingernails.

02:09.247 --> 02:10.505
They're glowing.

02:10.535 --> 02:13.023
That's because light rays
from beyond the visible

02:13.053 --> 02:15.953
- spectrum are striking...
- I'm sure they are.

02:17.538 --> 02:20.016
Look. It's plain to see
that you could use some

02:20.043 --> 02:22.484
distraction in your life. Here.

02:22.701 --> 02:23.543
What are these?

02:23.570 --> 02:25.650
Two tickets for a gala
ball that some dinosaur

02:25.677 --> 02:27.492
expert's putting on next week.

02:27.522 --> 02:29.856
- Professor Blake's exhibit.
- That's the chap.

02:30.446 --> 02:32.623
Sir, this is one of
"the" events of the year.

02:32.651 --> 02:34.839
Surely you'll want to be
taking Mrs. Brackenreid.

02:34.869 --> 02:37.823
Yes, well, the missus
and I are not completely

02:37.860 --> 02:40.391
seeing eye-to-eye on
certain matters these days.

02:40.608 --> 02:43.392
We won't be dancing anytime soon.

02:43.565 --> 02:46.007
Ah well then, you'll just have
to give them to someone else.

02:46.043 --> 02:47.843
I thought it was baptists
that didn't dance,

02:47.861 --> 02:49.208
not papists.

02:49.551 --> 02:51.631
Funny story about that, actually...

02:51.661 --> 02:53.982
Uh, excuse me, Sir, but you're needed.

03:10.910 --> 03:13.397
Inspector, Detective!

03:14.497 --> 03:15.807
What's going on here, Crabtree?

03:15.837 --> 03:17.971
A young lad on his way
fishing discovered it.

03:17.989 --> 03:20.430
Or discovered her, I should say.

03:20.550 --> 03:23.700
- She's quite the sight to behold.
- Sight? What do you mean by that?

03:24.054 --> 03:25.835
Take a look for yourself, Sir.

03:28.904 --> 03:30.320
Bloody hell, she's been gutted.

03:30.318 --> 03:31.657
Her name is Alberta Moffat.

03:31.687 --> 03:33.137
What do we know about her?

03:33.167 --> 03:34.580
Very little so far, Sir.

03:34.616 --> 03:36.720
A previous arrest for prostitution.

03:37.070 --> 03:39.430
There's something else you
should see. Just over here.

03:46.543 --> 03:47.860
"Try to stop me."

03:47.878 --> 03:49.450
Lunatic's taunting us.

03:49.470 --> 03:50.591
So it would seem.

03:50.618 --> 03:52.942
Oye! Oye! Oye! Hey! Where
do you think you're going?

03:52.979 --> 03:54.923
I told you, I need to speak
to your superior urgently...

03:54.950 --> 03:56.077
Now, bloody well let go of me!

03:56.107 --> 03:57.581
No, no, you'll be cooling
your heels in the clink...

03:57.590 --> 03:59.486
I don't have time for
this nonsense, Constable!

03:59.516 --> 04:00.517
Oye!

04:00.898 --> 04:01.997
What's going on?

04:04.174 --> 04:05.304
You in charge?

04:05.524 --> 04:07.421
Inspector Thomas Brackenreid.

04:07.451 --> 04:08.953
Toronto police department.

04:08.983 --> 04:11.952
- And just who might you be?
- Detective Edward Scanlon,

04:11.982 --> 04:13.326
Scotland Yard.

04:13.994 --> 04:15.994
I know who it is you're looking for.

04:16.771 --> 04:19.821
- You know who committed this murder?
- Yes, I do.

04:20.010 --> 04:23.309
And unless we catch him
he'll kill again and again.

04:30.231 --> 04:32.220
His name is Harlan Orgill

04:32.250 --> 04:35.027
and don't let the looks
deceive you. He's a maniac.

04:35.057 --> 04:37.582
And you've been pursuing
Mr. Orgill for how long?

04:37.612 --> 04:40.290
Fourteen months, three
weeks, and four days.

04:40.320 --> 04:41.296
Precisely?

04:41.326 --> 04:44.049
Yes. He was a suspect in a murder
I was investigating in London.

04:44.067 --> 04:46.590
He fled to Cairo, and I followed his trail

04:46.608 --> 04:49.442
- to Bombay and then to Auckland.
- Travelling the empire.

04:49.472 --> 04:55.119
Yes, and in every city, he murdered,
no slaughtered, eight women.

04:55.149 --> 04:56.823
- Always eight?
- Always.

04:57.047 --> 04:59.738
And every time he slipped
through my fingers.

04:59.768 --> 05:02.283
What makes you think
this Mr. Orgill is here?

05:02.737 --> 05:05.080
I found his rooming house in Auckland.

05:05.110 --> 05:08.956
Too late, but he'd left this behind.

05:09.529 --> 05:12.446
"Canadian women's council
celebrates anniversary."

05:12.476 --> 05:15.434
He hates women. He's
killed twenty-four of them.

05:15.464 --> 05:16.867
Twenty-five now.

05:16.897 --> 05:19.700
With presumably seven more
to be killed in this city.

05:19.702 --> 05:20.954
If he's here at all.

05:20.984 --> 05:22.741
This is just a scrap of paper.

05:22.771 --> 05:24.793
A man matching Orgill's description took

05:24.823 --> 05:26.548
the steamer from Auckland to Vancouver.

05:26.578 --> 05:28.801
That was almost four months ago.

05:28.831 --> 05:30.150
Two months at sea, give or take.

05:30.180 --> 05:32.377
Then he arrives at Vancouver,
spends a week there.

05:32.407 --> 05:33.949
Takes the train here to Toronto,

05:33.951 --> 05:36.601
then has a month to prepare
for his first murder.

05:37.048 --> 05:37.915
Exactly.

05:37.945 --> 05:39.476
Now... I don't know for a
fact that he took that train.

05:39.506 --> 05:41.367
But I do know what he does to his victims,

05:41.397 --> 05:43.934
and I can assure you he is here.

05:45.201 --> 05:47.002
Tell me... Inspector.

05:47.032 --> 05:49.631
Did that girl's body
remind you of something?

05:50.524 --> 05:52.196
Whitechapel, perhaps?

05:52.992 --> 05:54.395
Whitechapel?

05:54.425 --> 05:56.287
As in East End... Whitechapel?

05:56.289 --> 05:58.312
Well, you must admit,
there are similarities.

05:58.342 --> 05:59.937
The wounds, the prostitute victims.

05:59.967 --> 06:03.555
Sir, are you saying this
Orgill might be Jack the Ripper?

06:03.585 --> 06:06.912
Well, the Ripper was never caught.

06:06.942 --> 06:08.123
Mr. Scanlon...

06:08.633 --> 06:12.252
if you could just give Detective
Murdoch and myself a minute...

06:12.282 --> 06:13.398
Yes, of course.

06:13.428 --> 06:14.753
Thank you.

06:19.489 --> 06:21.051
I was still with the
regiment garrisoned near

06:21.081 --> 06:24.693
Whitechapel when I watched half the
bloody force work on the Ripper case.

06:25.298 --> 06:28.237
Hundreds, maybe a thousand
coppers. And he beat them all.

06:28.267 --> 06:30.918
Sir, the Ripper killings
were seven years ago.

06:30.948 --> 06:33.506
- The odds of this being the same man...
- You weren't there, Murdoch.

06:33.536 --> 06:35.416
What he did to those women...

06:35.446 --> 06:37.121
He made a laughing stock out of the finest

06:37.151 --> 06:38.412
police force in the world.

06:38.442 --> 06:40.035
I don't want that
happening here. Understood?

06:40.065 --> 06:41.166
Of course.

06:41.196 --> 06:42.367
You call yourself policemen!
It's a... disgrace!

06:42.397 --> 06:43.427
Mr. Scanlon, please!

06:43.457 --> 06:45.136
There was no harm intended.
The lads are just passing...

06:45.138 --> 06:47.686
It's a travesty is what it
is! A dereliction of duty.

06:47.716 --> 06:50.092
Hey! What's going on?

06:50.122 --> 06:52.525
Sir, we were just having
a game of checkers...

06:52.555 --> 06:54.629
Two of your constables
sitting around playing

06:54.659 --> 06:58.472
schoolboy games whilst a
killer walks the streets.

06:58.502 --> 07:00.297
Detective Scanlon has a point, gentlemen.

07:00.327 --> 07:02.510
- But Inspector...
- No buts!

07:02.540 --> 07:04.073
Make yourself useful.

07:04.075 --> 07:06.775
Detective Scanlon... if
you would be so kind as to

07:06.777 --> 07:10.264
assist Detective Murdoch,
we have a murderer to catch.

07:10.294 --> 07:11.443
Of course.

07:11.473 --> 07:12.909
Carry on, Detective.

07:17.663 --> 07:18.938
Right then.

07:19.703 --> 07:23.161
This is who we are
looking for. Harlan Orgill.

07:23.191 --> 07:25.516
Recently arrived to
Toronto by train sometime

07:25.546 --> 07:27.651
in the last month, so
make union station your

07:27.681 --> 07:29.069
starting point and work your way out.

07:29.099 --> 07:31.093
Check hotels, rooming houses,

07:31.123 --> 07:32.568
anywhere he might be staying.

07:32.598 --> 07:35.709
He may need money, so he
may be recently employed.

07:35.739 --> 07:37.906
Anything out of the usual is to be noted.

07:37.936 --> 07:39.130
- Understood?
- Sir.

07:39.160 --> 07:40.605
Thank you.

07:42.108 --> 07:45.885
Detective... I believe post
mortem results await us.

07:45.915 --> 07:47.383
Very good.

07:51.008 --> 07:53.191
So, the carotid artery on the left side

07:53.221 --> 07:55.627
and the other vessels contained
in the sheath were all cut through,

07:55.657 --> 07:58.647
save the posterior portion of
the carotid, to a line about

07:58.677 --> 08:00.694
one-twelfth of an inch in extent, which

08:00.696 --> 08:04.760
prevented the separation of the
upper and lower portion of the artery.

08:04.790 --> 08:07.666
I can go on like this for quite some time.

08:08.973 --> 08:10.646
Any idea of the weapon used?

08:10.676 --> 08:12.937
Yes, a short knife. Possibly something like

08:12.967 --> 08:14.642
a shoe-maker's. Well-ground, very sharp.

08:14.672 --> 08:17.017
And the shoulders... the
collarbone? Were they bruised?

08:17.047 --> 08:18.653
Bluish discolouration indicates

08:18.683 --> 08:20.679
- the victim was...
- And the wounds were left to right?

08:20.709 --> 08:21.779
Yes.

08:21.809 --> 08:22.673
His technique.

08:22.703 --> 08:24.633
Always the same. Grabs
them by the shoulders,

08:24.663 --> 08:26.800
holds them down, and cuts them.

08:27.124 --> 08:28.858
That's a plausible scenario.

08:28.860 --> 08:29.939
"Plausible"?

08:29.969 --> 08:32.150
I'm telling you, that's
bloody well what happened.

08:32.179 --> 08:34.736
From Whitechapel to here.
Exactly as the Ripper did them.

08:34.765 --> 08:37.662
There are similarities. Striking
ones, I'll admit. But I... I... I...

08:37.692 --> 08:39.692
What more do you need to know?

08:40.655 --> 08:42.321
It's not that I'm disagreeing
with you, Detective,

08:42.351 --> 08:44.163
but these wounds could have
been inflicted by anyone...

08:44.193 --> 08:45.992
with rudimentary knowledge of butchery.

08:46.022 --> 08:48.583
I'm telling you... this is our killer!

08:48.613 --> 08:49.653
Detective Scanlon...

08:49.683 --> 08:53.971
A murderer kills unabated... and at
every turn I have met with indifference.

08:54.001 --> 08:56.053
Wha... what in the world?

08:56.083 --> 08:59.357
Mr. Scanlon, your behaviour
is quite unacceptable.

08:59.387 --> 09:01.734
I will no longer stand by
as you irrationally berate

09:01.764 --> 09:04.712
Dr. Ogden or my fellow officers.

09:05.333 --> 09:07.639
I believe an apology is in order.

09:08.244 --> 09:10.571
Yes. Yes, you're quite right.

09:10.601 --> 09:12.618
I don't know what came over me.

09:13.734 --> 09:15.789
Please accept my apologies, Doctor.

09:15.997 --> 09:17.303
Of course.

09:18.419 --> 09:20.892
Now, while my men search for the killer,

09:20.922 --> 09:23.274
might I suggest we
follow up with the victim?

09:28.901 --> 09:30.781
I took the first train I could.

09:30.811 --> 09:34.319
There wasn't any train in Grafton;
I had to go all the way to Cobourg.

09:34.654 --> 09:37.390
We appreciate the haste, Mrs. Moffat.

09:38.282 --> 09:41.006
They would only let me see her face.

09:41.755 --> 09:43.667
What did he do to her?

09:44.958 --> 09:49.221
Perhaps it would be best if we
discussed that at a different time.

09:49.503 --> 09:50.776
I see.

09:52.418 --> 09:55.627
Do you have any idea what your
daughter was doing last night?

09:55.657 --> 09:58.724
She worked at St. Michael's
hospital, in the laundry.

09:58.754 --> 10:00.349
Twelve hour shift.

10:01.051 --> 10:05.058
She would have finished
work and been going home.

10:05.297 --> 10:06.982
And where was home?

10:08.417 --> 10:11.494
It was a... a boarding
house on Shuter Street.

10:12.912 --> 10:16.368
We suspect that she may have
been doing something else.

10:16.814 --> 10:21.899
Oh well, Alberta worked very
late. She would have been tired.

10:23.574 --> 10:25.357
Mrs. Moffat.

10:25.387 --> 10:29.531
Did you know your
daughter was a prostitute?

10:30.710 --> 10:33.561
My daughter was no such thing.

10:34.740 --> 10:36.142
I see.

10:37.353 --> 10:41.375
Is that how you think
she met this... animal?

10:42.153 --> 10:44.065
It's a theory.

10:47.587 --> 10:50.346
Malcolm, her father.

10:51.605 --> 10:52.906
He had consumption.

10:52.936 --> 10:55.695
And... I couldn't put food on the table.

10:56.715 --> 11:01.125
And Alberta would help me
out, if you know what I mean.

11:01.981 --> 11:03.452
I do.

11:03.482 --> 11:06.055
But those days were behind her.

11:06.085 --> 11:07.991
I am sure of it.

11:10.215 --> 11:11.878
Weren't they?

11:13.616 --> 11:16.390
I have met twenty-four
mothers like her. Twenty-four.

11:16.420 --> 11:19.522
So I hope you see why sometimes
I grow a little impatient.

11:19.761 --> 11:20.988
I do.

11:21.164 --> 11:24.668
So Miss Moffat is working
her shift at the hospital.

11:24.976 --> 11:28.601
After work... having
trouble making ends meet,

11:29.637 --> 11:31.503
she reverts back to her old ways?

11:31.533 --> 11:35.312
But unfortunately, her
customer is Harlan Orgill.

11:36.377 --> 11:39.824
Hm. We'll have to ascertain Miss
Moffat's movements after work.

11:39.854 --> 11:42.952
- I'll get the men on it straight away.
- Detective,

11:42.982 --> 11:44.960
might we make a stop on the way back?

11:44.990 --> 11:47.252
Of course. Is there something you require?

11:47.282 --> 11:50.031
Yes, a... a peace offering.

11:58.865 --> 12:01.869
- Any progress, George?
- Nothing so far, I'm afraid, Sir.

12:01.942 --> 12:03.447
There's something else I'll need you to do.

12:03.477 --> 12:06.044
I'll need you to look into
our victim's final hours,

12:06.046 --> 12:08.612
- starting at St. Michael's hospital.
- Right away, Sir.

12:10.027 --> 12:11.876
Hard at it, are we, lads?

12:12.100 --> 12:13.271
Yes, Sir.

12:13.301 --> 12:15.582
Look... uh, about earlier.

12:15.612 --> 12:17.907
I'd like to make amends.

12:18.512 --> 12:21.513
That's not necessary, Sir.
Your point was well taken.

12:21.543 --> 12:23.628
No, please, I insist.

12:32.845 --> 12:34.598
Snakes and ladders, Sir?

12:34.628 --> 12:36.415
To replace your checkers board.

12:36.445 --> 12:39.154
I've played it incessantly whilst
I've been following Mr. Orgill.

12:39.184 --> 12:40.951
Allow me to show you how it's played.

12:40.981 --> 12:44.990
The objective of the game is to get to the

12:45.020 --> 12:48.175
end square using various rolls of the dice.

12:48.205 --> 12:50.673
However, should you land on a ladder

12:50.703 --> 12:53.223
you ascend via a short cut.

12:53.253 --> 12:56.361
But land on a snake and you descend.

12:57.809 --> 12:59.431
It's really quite addictive.

13:00.271 --> 13:02.071
Well, thank you, Sir.

13:02.397 --> 13:06.938
And when we have more time...
we'll... we'll give it a try.

13:09.746 --> 13:11.228
Well done, Sir.

13:12.136 --> 13:13.253
So, what's our next move?

13:13.283 --> 13:16.120
Well, I suggest there's
nothing more we can do this day,

13:16.150 --> 13:19.177
we should get some rest.
You're probably exhausted.

13:19.207 --> 13:20.739
Yes, I am.

13:20.769 --> 13:22.476
- Well, good night.
- Right.

13:22.506 --> 13:24.784
Oh, Detective Scanlon.

13:24.814 --> 13:26.951
We will catch this man.

13:26.981 --> 13:28.755
Of course we will.

13:37.416 --> 13:39.568
You must be Mr. Murdoch.

13:39.598 --> 13:41.496
- That's correct.
- Welcome.

13:41.526 --> 13:45.014
I am Professor Otranto, and
I will make you a dancer.

13:45.508 --> 13:46.815
Uh, good. Good.

13:46.845 --> 13:48.253
That is what you want, is it not?

13:48.283 --> 13:51.550
Uh yes, I had hoped to
improve my technique.

13:51.580 --> 13:54.455
Very well. But first we must
evaluate your abilities, yes.

13:54.485 --> 13:55.688
Catarina?

13:55.690 --> 13:57.090
Evaluate?

13:57.120 --> 13:59.305
Assume the position, Sir.

14:00.169 --> 14:02.575
What position would that be?

14:05.833 --> 14:08.467
Mm, now dance.

14:15.292 --> 14:18.464
Oh, there's much work to be done here.

14:40.393 --> 14:42.528
Have we another, George?

14:42.530 --> 14:43.830
It would seem so, Sir.

14:43.860 --> 14:45.987
Has Detective Scanlon been informed?

14:46.017 --> 14:47.889
Actually, he's here.

14:47.919 --> 14:50.620
He was at the station when word came in.

14:58.033 --> 14:59.803
We weren't much help to her, were we?

14:59.833 --> 15:00.951
No.

15:01.652 --> 15:03.354
He left another message.

15:04.311 --> 15:05.856
_

15:07.799 --> 15:08.611
Sir.

15:08.803 --> 15:10.444
- Sirs.
- Yes.

15:10.986 --> 15:12.484
We canvassed the area for witnesses.

15:12.514 --> 15:13.898
One woman who was up nursing her child

15:13.928 --> 15:16.177
saw a carriage wheel
past late in the night.

15:16.207 --> 15:17.787
That doesn't seem unusual.

15:17.817 --> 15:20.238
Oh well, we were asked to keep a mind
for something out of the ordinary, Sir,

15:20.268 --> 15:21.805
and this carriage happened
to match the description

15:21.835 --> 15:23.909
of one reported stolen the
day of the first murder.

15:23.939 --> 15:26.461
Hm, far too much of a
coincidence to be ignored.

15:26.491 --> 15:27.780
Indeed.

15:28.099 --> 15:29.592
Very good work, Constable.

15:30.426 --> 15:32.294
Thank you, Sir.

15:34.660 --> 15:35.687
What's the girl's name?

15:35.717 --> 15:37.556
- Gloria Abercrombie.
- How old?

15:37.586 --> 15:39.808
Nineteen. Recently moved here from Orilia.

15:39.838 --> 15:41.800
And she ends up getting
slaughtered like the other.

15:41.830 --> 15:44.424
The wounds were similar, however
the circumstances were different.

15:44.426 --> 15:46.249
There is no indication this
Ambercrombie was a prostitute.

15:46.279 --> 15:49.811
No? So what's a good girl doing
walking out by herself late at night?

15:49.841 --> 15:51.950
She worked for a seamstress.
They were working late on a dress.

15:51.980 --> 15:54.575
According to the seamstress, Miss
Abercrombie was on her way home.

15:54.605 --> 15:56.248
She was staying at the YWCA.

15:56.278 --> 15:57.692
All right. So she gets off work late.

15:57.722 --> 15:59.780
There's no trams running.
She starts to walk home.

15:59.810 --> 16:02.914
Orgill is on the prowl in the
stolen carriage. He spots the victim.

16:02.944 --> 16:04.895
This is where I begin to have difficulty.

16:04.925 --> 16:07.365
Why choose Miss Abercrombie
if she wasn't a prostitute?

16:07.395 --> 16:09.102
Mistaken identity in poor light?

16:09.132 --> 16:12.134
Well, even so... why would she get into
a carriage with a complete stranger?

16:12.164 --> 16:13.217
Maybe he enticed her.

16:13.247 --> 16:14.902
More likely... she was
forced into the carriage.

16:14.932 --> 16:16.910
Yet no one heard or saw a thing.

16:16.940 --> 16:19.556
Well, The Ripper managed
to vivisect five women

16:19.586 --> 16:21.675
in the heart of London and
no one saw or heard him.

16:21.705 --> 16:24.024
Regardless, we do have a concrete clue.

16:24.054 --> 16:26.207
I suggest we divide your expertise.

16:26.237 --> 16:28.243
Detective Scanlon you
work with the constables.

16:28.273 --> 16:29.709
Find out whoever stole that carriage.

16:29.739 --> 16:32.259
Murdoch... follow up on the victim.

16:37.215 --> 16:39.886
- She was a seamtress.
- Yes, the puncture marks.

16:40.179 --> 16:42.172
She was a hard worker.

16:42.746 --> 16:46.086
Any indication she might
have also been a prostitute?

16:46.088 --> 16:48.250
No. Her hymen was intact.

16:48.520 --> 16:50.799
Oh. I see.

16:51.071 --> 16:52.760
You seem troubled, William.

16:52.790 --> 16:54.525
This is a dreadful case.

16:54.555 --> 16:55.847
Yes, quite.

16:55.877 --> 16:58.305
There are a number of details that
are troubling me about this case.

16:58.335 --> 16:59.700
Such as?

17:00.085 --> 17:01.536
With the nature of this wound, Doctor,

17:01.538 --> 17:04.213
would the killer not have
been convered in blood?

17:04.242 --> 17:05.436
Not necessarily.

17:05.467 --> 17:07.242
The commencement of the
wound and injury would

17:07.243 --> 17:10.117
have been away from him, and
therefore the stream of blood

17:10.146 --> 17:12.942
and it would have been a stream
would also have been away from him.

17:12.972 --> 17:14.478
Which is another matter.

17:14.508 --> 17:16.851
There was no blood to speak of
where either victim was found.

17:16.881 --> 17:20.085
Suggesting they were killed
elsewhere and then moved.

17:21.400 --> 17:24.683
I wish I could better understand
the mind that did this.

17:24.713 --> 17:27.528
A... a colleague
mentioned a young alienist,

17:27.530 --> 17:29.681
a... a Doctor Roberts, who
was recently removed from

17:29.711 --> 17:32.151
his position at the
provincial lunatic asylum.

17:32.181 --> 17:33.119
"Removed"?

17:33.149 --> 17:35.260
Yes, apparently his
research on the workings

17:35.290 --> 17:37.645
of the criminal mind
ruffled too many feathers.

17:37.675 --> 17:39.875
However, he's supposed to
be quite forward-thinking.

17:39.877 --> 17:41.576
Perhaps he could be of assistance.

17:41.578 --> 17:43.548
Any idea where I might
find this Dr. Roberts?

17:43.578 --> 17:47.417
My understanding is he's practicing
at a private hospital in Etobicoke.

17:47.447 --> 17:49.651
Ah, thank you.

17:49.653 --> 17:51.586
My pleasure.

17:52.714 --> 17:53.888
Julia.

17:55.170 --> 17:59.477
I've recently obtained tickets
to the upcoming dinosaur ball.

17:59.507 --> 18:02.362
And I wondered if you
might be interested in

18:02.364 --> 18:03.708
attending?

18:04.218 --> 18:06.167
Yes, of course.

18:06.463 --> 18:08.008
That would be most delightful.

18:08.710 --> 18:10.239
Very good.

18:16.441 --> 18:20.074
Hydrotherapy, most impressive.
Now, Doctor I'm here because

18:20.104 --> 18:22.289
I want you to help me
understand what's going on

18:22.319 --> 18:23.565
inside of the killer's mind.

18:23.595 --> 18:25.206
Well, that's rather a tall order.

18:25.236 --> 18:26.513
To what end?

18:26.543 --> 18:28.820
I wish to create a
"portrait" of the killer.

18:28.850 --> 18:30.302
By understanding what motivates him,

18:30.332 --> 18:32.453
I hope to find the means to stop him.

18:32.483 --> 18:35.399
The concept is intriguing.

18:35.429 --> 18:37.199
I will see that all of
the information we have

18:37.229 --> 18:39.093
on the killer is delivered right to you.

18:39.123 --> 18:42.025
Very well. I will turn my
attention to it immediately.

18:42.090 --> 18:44.049
- Excellent.
- Uh, Detective.

18:44.375 --> 18:46.473
I am considered somewhat of a, uh,

18:46.503 --> 18:49.073
a pariah because of my methods.

18:49.456 --> 18:51.957
Precisely why I think
you can help me, Doctor.

18:52.993 --> 18:54.397
Oh, for the love of...

18:54.427 --> 18:55.699
Nothing better to do, George?

18:55.729 --> 18:58.086
Oh n... n... no, Sir, we
were just waiting for you.

18:59.074 --> 19:00.522
Fascinating game, eh?

19:01.505 --> 19:02.939
A morality play.

19:02.969 --> 19:04.453
Ladders reward good deeds.

19:04.483 --> 19:06.561
- Snakes punish bad ones.
- I don't like it, Sir.

19:06.916 --> 19:09.721
All your progress stolen away
by these slithery little...

19:09.751 --> 19:11.270
This one is clearly staring at me.

19:11.300 --> 19:14.954
- George. Anything to report?
- Yes. We found the stolen carriage.

19:20.440 --> 19:21.619
And it hasn't been touched?

19:21.649 --> 19:25.428
No, Sir. We knew you'd want to
inspect the carriage yourself.

19:30.983 --> 19:33.321
Your constables were adamant
that I should wait for you

19:33.323 --> 19:35.335
before inspecting the carriage.

19:35.925 --> 19:38.793
- They're a clever bunch.
- Yes. Yes, they are.

19:39.464 --> 19:42.204
Unfortunately, so too is Mr. Orgill.

19:42.234 --> 19:44.148
He's left it spotless.

19:44.435 --> 19:46.121
Or so it would seem.

19:48.097 --> 19:49.147
Haul it in.

19:50.180 --> 19:52.301
George, can you get the daylight-ina-box?

19:52.331 --> 19:53.442
- Sir.
- Thank you.

19:53.444 --> 19:55.754
I'm still unclear as to what
it is you hope to achieve.

19:55.784 --> 19:57.428
We recently had a case where a fluorescing

19:57.458 --> 19:59.770
substance provided a critical clue.

19:59.800 --> 20:02.056
Now all kinds of things... body fluids,

20:02.086 --> 20:05.275
fibres... fluoresce when
exposed to ultraviolet light.

20:05.305 --> 20:07.389
- Thank you, George.
- Ultraviolet?

20:07.419 --> 20:10.423
Yes. It's light outside
of the visible spectrum.

20:10.453 --> 20:12.383
There have been recent
developments photographing

20:12.413 --> 20:13.837
it using special filters.

20:13.867 --> 20:16.803
Which got me thinking, if
I put one of those filters

20:16.833 --> 20:19.444
on a light, could I then
generate ultraviolet light?

20:19.474 --> 20:22.583
- And if so...
- What clues might be revealed?

20:22.613 --> 20:25.440
Precisely. So I contacted a young Mr. Woods

20:25.442 --> 20:29.313
at the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology who helped me with this.

20:29.343 --> 20:31.692
Thank you, George.

20:33.757 --> 20:36.801
Now, let's see what's really here.

20:39.681 --> 20:42.055
Sir, what are those dark areas?

20:43.729 --> 20:46.575
One of the things that
doesn't fluoresce is blood.

20:46.878 --> 20:48.137
My God.

20:49.542 --> 20:53.670
Gentlemen, we now know
where the murders took place.

20:57.790 --> 21:01.649
We now know conclusively that whoever
stole that carriage is our killer.

21:01.679 --> 21:04.558
Alberta Moffat finishes
her shift at the hospital,

21:04.588 --> 21:08.051
makes her way home to her
boarding house on Shuter Street.

21:08.081 --> 21:11.206
Gloria Abercrombie finishes
at the seamstresses'.

21:11.236 --> 21:13.879
And makes her way to
her lodgings at the YWCA.

21:13.909 --> 21:15.823
Look, forget the maps.

21:15.853 --> 21:17.736
What I want to know is why
two young women would let

21:17.766 --> 21:20.483
themselves get talked into a
carriage by a complete stranger

21:20.513 --> 21:21.692
who then murders them?

21:21.722 --> 21:25.049
We have a good reason for Miss
Moffat, but not for Miss Abercrombie.

21:25.079 --> 21:28.519
Inspector, do you remember back
in Whitechapel, there was talk.

21:28.549 --> 21:31.940
- There was lots of talk.
- Yeah, I mean that the Ripper was someone

21:31.970 --> 21:33.809
respected, someone that a girl could trust.

21:33.839 --> 21:35.068
Gull.

21:35.276 --> 21:37.540
- Gull?
- The royal surgeon.

21:37.570 --> 21:39.930
Rumour had it that he might
have been cleaning up after eddy.

21:39.960 --> 21:41.109
Prince Albert.

21:41.139 --> 21:43.234
Frequented the doxies and
there was told that there

21:43.264 --> 21:45.481
were a few heirs to the
throne with less than

21:45.511 --> 21:47.051
royal bloodlines.

21:47.081 --> 21:49.555
- Are you saying this Gull could have...
- Not Gull.

21:49.585 --> 21:51.308
The old codger died
from a stroke years ago.

21:51.338 --> 21:55.251
But someone like a doctor.
They suspected a Canadian too.

21:55.281 --> 21:57.542
Dr. Thomas Cream. But he was executed.

21:57.572 --> 22:00.118
Yes... yes, yes. The point
is that the victims got into

22:00.148 --> 22:02.729
the carriage of a respectable-looking man.

22:03.063 --> 22:05.627
My question is why these two women.

22:05.657 --> 22:07.969
There could be a thousand reasons.

22:07.999 --> 22:11.018
The most likely one is that
he just stumbled upon them.

22:11.048 --> 22:14.769
I still think our best bet is
finding whoever stole that carriage.

22:14.799 --> 22:18.159
- Agreed.
- Very good. I have an appointment.

22:18.189 --> 22:21.264
I went through the files your
Detective Scanlon had amassed.

22:21.294 --> 22:22.970
They were quite substantial.

22:23.000 --> 22:24.531
Yes, he's obsessed with the case.

22:24.561 --> 22:26.218
Well, they've been of enormous help.

22:26.248 --> 22:30.346
I think I've been able to grasp
something of the killer and his victims.

22:30.376 --> 22:31.373
And?

22:31.403 --> 22:34.631
Obviously, the killer has
a deep anger towards women.

22:34.661 --> 22:38.475
So deep and powerful, that
he's compelled to kill them.

22:38.670 --> 22:40.136
He must keep his anger well-hidden.

22:40.166 --> 22:41.682
By wearing a mask.

22:41.712 --> 22:43.411
- A mask?
- A figurative one.

22:43.441 --> 22:45.162
A mask of sanity.

22:45.192 --> 22:47.750
Are you familiar with Philippe Pinel?

22:48.203 --> 22:49.510
The French alienist.

22:49.540 --> 22:50.578
That's him.

22:50.608 --> 22:53.685
He uses the term "manie sans délire"

22:53.715 --> 22:58.826
to describe disturbed individuals who show
no visible sign of any mental disorder.

22:58.856 --> 23:01.265
- Like Dr. Jeckyll and Mr. Hyde.
- Exactly.

23:01.295 --> 23:03.496
The condition would have
started in childhood.

23:03.526 --> 23:05.072
Most likely something quite traumatic

23:05.102 --> 23:08.268
caused the killer to
create a secondary world.

23:08.298 --> 23:09.304
A fantasy world?

23:09.334 --> 23:11.672
One where the child could remain safely.

23:11.702 --> 23:16.301
In doing so, he also created a world
for Mr. Hyde to eventually inhabit.

23:17.560 --> 23:21.257
But how does one go from
childhood innocence to murderer?

23:21.287 --> 23:24.502
I suspect when the killer
reached sexual maturity,

23:24.532 --> 23:26.462
he had difficulty with women.

23:26.492 --> 23:28.318
Possibly, he may be impotent.

23:28.348 --> 23:31.840
Regardless, inside him,
anger grew towards them,

23:31.870 --> 23:35.180
eventually becoming murderous rage.

23:35.210 --> 23:36.722
Why kill these specific women?

23:36.752 --> 23:39.152
Well, looking back over the
case, there seems to be one loose,

23:39.182 --> 23:42.416
but common thread, all the women worked.

23:42.446 --> 23:43.787
Is that a reason to kill?

23:43.978 --> 23:46.180
For a man already threatened by them, yes.

23:46.210 --> 23:48.666
By killing them, he
bolsters his own esteem.

23:48.696 --> 23:50.982
And the more powerful the woman,

23:51.012 --> 23:53.134
the greater the effect.

23:53.994 --> 23:56.023
Why kill Miss Moffat?

23:56.565 --> 23:59.476
She was a prostitute.
Hardly a powerful woman.

23:59.506 --> 24:03.340
I'm afraid that's one of a
number of things I can't answer.

24:03.370 --> 24:06.123
I have no idea why he strikes eight times.

24:06.153 --> 24:09.365
But the number is clearly
of significance to him.

24:09.843 --> 24:12.316
I've been thinking about the
message he leaves at the scene.

24:12.346 --> 24:14.432
- "Try to stop me."
- Yes.

24:14.462 --> 24:18.065
Could it be a plea for
help, rather than a taunt?

24:18.095 --> 24:20.428
Something from the Dr.
Jekyll side of his mind.

24:20.683 --> 24:23.376
Wanting the Mr. Hyde side of him stopped.

24:23.870 --> 24:25.368
It's very possible.

24:26.022 --> 24:28.421
Well, that's my report, such as it is.

24:28.451 --> 24:30.142
I wish I could have been of more help.

24:30.172 --> 24:32.789
On the contrary, it
could prove quite useful.

24:32.819 --> 24:34.701
What use is this supposed to be?

24:34.731 --> 24:37.390
- It's a description of what...
- might motivate the killer.

24:37.431 --> 24:39.926
Well, that's bloody obvious.
But how does it help us?

24:40.000 --> 24:42.335
Sir, I understand it's not a tangible clue.

24:42.365 --> 24:44.002
- However...
- That's an understatement.

24:44.004 --> 24:45.902
Inspector, if I might...
I'm not much for these

24:45.932 --> 24:48.639
modern techniques either,
but for the first time

24:48.641 --> 24:51.076
I feel as if I can
really understand Orgill.

24:51.078 --> 24:53.010
Seems to me like we're
just clutching at straws.

24:53.012 --> 24:54.412
We are. But we now know more about

24:54.414 --> 24:55.684
the sort of man that we're looking for.

24:55.714 --> 24:57.979
Angry, sexually deviant.

24:58.009 --> 24:59.110
Point taken.

24:59.140 --> 25:01.248
All right, Murdoch. Get
the men to round up suspects

25:01.278 --> 25:03.466
- who fit this portrait.
- Yes, Sir.

25:03.496 --> 25:05.554
Mr. Scanlon, fancy a drink?

25:05.841 --> 25:07.036
Yes, I think I could
do with one, thank you.

25:07.066 --> 25:08.390
I thought you might.

25:08.420 --> 25:11.496
- Murdoch, I don't suppose...
- I'm afraid I'm already late

25:11.526 --> 25:13.490
for a previous engagement.

25:13.520 --> 25:14.685
I figured as much.

25:24.687 --> 25:25.761
Ah, Detective!

25:25.763 --> 25:26.950
Sorry I'm late, Professor.

25:26.980 --> 25:28.544
No time for excuses, good Sir.

25:28.574 --> 25:30.153
There is one partner left.

25:30.183 --> 25:31.672
A new student.

25:31.702 --> 25:33.434
Katarina!

25:38.043 --> 25:39.607
Detective.

25:39.609 --> 25:40.649
Doctor.

25:40.679 --> 25:42.242
Ah, you know one another.

25:42.272 --> 25:43.183
Very good.

25:43.213 --> 25:45.283
But now, to business.

26:09.325 --> 26:10.870
So where are you from?

26:10.925 --> 26:11.843
Seven Oaks.

26:11.873 --> 26:13.148
- Cheers.
- You?

26:13.178 --> 26:14.458
Doncaster.

26:14.488 --> 26:15.985
Do you miss the old country?

26:16.288 --> 26:17.695
Certain days.

26:17.725 --> 26:18.738
My parents. My brother.

26:18.768 --> 26:20.249
What about yourself?

26:20.251 --> 26:21.357
I have a sister.

26:21.387 --> 26:22.680
We never knew our mother.

26:22.710 --> 26:24.083
What about your father?

26:24.113 --> 26:26.355
He was never the same after Crimea.

26:26.357 --> 26:28.089
Took his own life.

26:28.369 --> 26:30.258
Bloody, savage war.

26:30.260 --> 26:31.660
Yes, it was.

26:32.190 --> 26:33.467
And you served as well?

26:33.497 --> 26:34.463
Afghan.

26:34.493 --> 26:35.802
That was a mistake.

26:35.832 --> 26:37.671
Most of my regiment were wiped out.

26:37.701 --> 26:39.085
Sorry to hear that.

26:39.115 --> 26:40.375
Yeah, I had my fill of war.

26:40.405 --> 26:42.787
Went to the Yard after I got
back. Wasn't much better there.

26:42.817 --> 26:44.062
No?

26:44.092 --> 26:46.464
Whitechapel, The Ripper.

26:47.229 --> 26:49.514
Made me sick to my stomach.

26:50.040 --> 26:51.771
It was quite a gruesome sight.

26:51.801 --> 26:54.335
No, I mean the... the poverty, the dirt,

26:54.365 --> 26:56.156
the brutality.

26:56.186 --> 26:58.403
What sort of world is it
where children go hungry

26:58.433 --> 27:01.840
and are beaten whilst we build an empire?

27:01.842 --> 27:04.761
I suppose we're just trying
to do the best we can.

27:04.791 --> 27:06.418
You know, Orgill.

27:06.448 --> 27:07.741
There'll be more like him.

27:07.771 --> 27:10.182
Killers who kill for no reason.

27:10.184 --> 27:11.486
I hope you're mistaken, Edward.

27:11.516 --> 27:12.921
No, they're coming.

27:12.951 --> 27:14.299
We make them.

27:14.329 --> 27:17.322
That's why men like you and I
are here, to try and stop them.

27:17.352 --> 27:18.584
Well, it shouldn't be this way.

27:18.614 --> 27:20.514
No, it shouldn't, but it is.

27:22.345 --> 27:24.245
Rule, Britannia.

27:24.275 --> 27:26.078
God save the Queen.

27:31.666 --> 27:32.527
Doctor.

27:32.557 --> 27:33.999
- Yes?
- Perhaps I could lead.

27:34.029 --> 27:37.091
Oh? I'm so sorry.

27:37.298 --> 27:39.650
It's a good thing we
both decided to brush up.

27:39.680 --> 27:42.837
Yes, well... I had hoped to impress you,

27:42.867 --> 27:45.122
not cripple you.

27:50.272 --> 27:53.061
Doctor, may I ask you a question?

27:54.478 --> 27:55.739
Yes.

27:57.510 --> 28:00.316
May we discuss the case as we dance?

28:02.308 --> 28:05.621
I... I thought you'd never ask.

28:06.191 --> 28:09.633
Good, because there is
an aspect that puzzles me.

28:09.663 --> 28:13.159
How does the killer choose his victims?

28:13.189 --> 28:18.448
All right, well, he arrives in
the city and he needs to kill.

28:18.478 --> 28:20.253
He wants to find women who are working.

28:20.283 --> 28:22.931
Yes, but choosing them
randomly would be too risky.

28:22.961 --> 28:24.539
So where does he look?

28:25.177 --> 28:27.444
Perhaps he watches their employer.

28:27.446 --> 28:29.443
They both worked for different companies,

28:29.473 --> 28:31.348
but I suppose it's possible.

28:31.350 --> 28:36.116
Perhaps he selects them from
a certain geographical area.

28:36.146 --> 28:37.392
One lived in Cabbagetown.

28:37.422 --> 28:39.304
The other closer to The Annex.

28:39.334 --> 28:41.017
He must have known
something about his victims.

28:41.047 --> 28:43.120
Some... some common link.

28:43.150 --> 28:44.411
But what?

28:47.436 --> 28:49.412
Ladies and... gentlemen.

28:49.442 --> 28:51.643
A military two-step.

28:53.661 --> 28:55.510
Watch your toes, Detective.

29:00.279 --> 29:02.699
Ah, Murdoch. While you've
been fannying around,

29:02.729 --> 29:04.129
there's been a development.

29:04.159 --> 29:06.174
Fannying, Sir?

29:06.780 --> 29:08.329
He goes by the name Morris Bailey.

29:08.359 --> 29:10.847
He was caught spying on a
girl in Winchester last night.

29:10.877 --> 29:13.061
Turns out the room he
was boarding in was filled

29:13.091 --> 29:14.669
with women's underwear.

29:15.004 --> 29:16.510
And how do we know he's our man?

29:16.540 --> 29:17.954
He also works in the Slaughter Yard,

29:17.984 --> 29:19.723
so he knows his way around a knife.

29:19.753 --> 29:21.743
He's British and he arrived from Vancouver

29:21.773 --> 29:22.745
three weeks ago.

29:22.775 --> 29:25.207
I'd say he's an excellent suspect.

29:25.421 --> 29:26.568
Let us see.

29:26.598 --> 29:28.034
Be my guest.

29:30.438 --> 29:32.009
Mr. Bailey.

29:32.011 --> 29:34.778
My name is Detective William Murdoch.

29:36.287 --> 29:39.490
Look, that woman left her window wide open.

29:39.520 --> 29:42.195
Fairly asking for any man to look at her.

29:42.225 --> 29:43.454
I see.

29:44.235 --> 29:47.099
I understand you recently
arrived to the city.

29:47.129 --> 29:48.071
Where from?

29:48.101 --> 29:49.187
What has that got to do with anything?

29:49.217 --> 29:50.857
Please, just answer the question.

29:50.887 --> 29:52.116
Vancouver.

29:52.753 --> 29:54.254
What were you doing there?

29:54.796 --> 29:56.628
I was visiting my brother.

29:57.327 --> 29:58.857
And before that?

29:58.887 --> 30:01.495
San Francisco. Look, why
are you asking me that?

30:01.525 --> 30:05.073
What has that got to do with
me looking through no window?

30:05.103 --> 30:07.840
Are you currently employed at the
Frederick street Slaughter Yard?

30:07.870 --> 30:10.310
Yeah. I'm a watchman there.

30:12.969 --> 30:16.809
Do you recognize this carriage?

30:17.272 --> 30:18.499
No.

30:18.529 --> 30:20.519
It was stolen from a residence three blocks

30:20.549 --> 30:22.241
away from the Slaughter Yards.

30:22.271 --> 30:24.719
No. I had nothing to do with that.

30:24.749 --> 30:27.240
Do you recognize this woman?

30:27.270 --> 30:28.706
No.

30:29.583 --> 30:30.912
This woman?

30:32.394 --> 30:33.600
Say... wait a minute.

30:34.190 --> 30:35.911
Yeah yeah yeah, these are
the two women that I saw

30:35.941 --> 30:37.887
their pictures on the front of the paper.

30:37.917 --> 30:40.323
These are the two women that were murdered.

30:43.319 --> 30:46.919
No, no, no... you got it all wrong.

30:47.253 --> 30:49.696
I had nothing to do with them.

30:49.726 --> 30:52.414
Mister Bailey, where
were you three nights ago?

30:52.972 --> 30:54.927
I don't remember.

30:54.957 --> 30:57.541
Sometimes, I have a few too many.

30:57.571 --> 31:01.341
And the night before last? Did
you also then have a few too many?

31:01.371 --> 31:04.174
I would never do anything to hurt a woman.

31:04.204 --> 31:05.204
Never.

31:05.234 --> 31:06.661
Why should I believe you?

31:06.916 --> 31:10.518
Because I don't harm them.
I just like to look at them.

31:11.343 --> 31:13.394
You do believe me, don't you?

31:15.259 --> 31:17.945
- That remains to be seen.
- Wait wait wait, look!

31:17.975 --> 31:19.889
You won't tell my mother, will you?

31:19.919 --> 31:21.690
Because honestly it
would be the death of her.

31:21.720 --> 31:22.996
You must promise me that.

31:23.026 --> 31:25.348
There will be no promises at this time.

31:29.790 --> 31:31.336
Gentlemen.

31:34.778 --> 31:37.654
We'll let him stew for awhile.
Then I'll take a crack at him.

31:39.582 --> 31:41.654
Something wrong, Detective?

31:41.832 --> 31:44.159
I suppose I thought he'd be less banal.

31:44.189 --> 31:45.800
Banal?

31:46.824 --> 31:50.186
For what it's worth, I
don't think he's our killer.

31:54.104 --> 31:55.518
What do you mean, he's not our killer?

31:55.548 --> 31:57.407
He didn't have the motivation.

31:57.409 --> 31:58.702
Motivation?

31:58.732 --> 32:00.503
Motivation? The man's sick.

32:00.774 --> 32:03.075
He plays with himself while
he watches women undress.

32:03.105 --> 32:04.780
Then he steals their soiled undergarments.

32:04.782 --> 32:06.315
He only likes to watch.

32:06.317 --> 32:08.750
- Trivialities.
- Sir,

32:08.780 --> 32:10.585
He worked at the Slaughter
Yards as a watchman.

32:10.587 --> 32:12.054
There's no reason to believe he knows

32:12.056 --> 32:13.348
how to use a knife in that way.

32:13.378 --> 32:16.519
Look, Murdoch, he fits your
alienist's bloody profile.

32:16.549 --> 32:18.101
- Portrait.
- Portrait, profile...

32:18.131 --> 32:19.518
Wh... what difference does it make?

32:19.548 --> 32:20.634
I'm telling you he's our man.

32:20.664 --> 32:22.324
Sir, may I suggest that we...

32:22.354 --> 32:23.388
Sirs!

32:23.418 --> 32:26.802
Sir, there's a... there's
a problem with the prisoner.

32:26.804 --> 32:29.671
You'll be letting me go
or your boy here gets it.

32:30.081 --> 32:31.260
It's no use, Mr. Bailey.

32:31.290 --> 32:33.842
I am not hanging over those whores!

32:33.872 --> 32:35.312
You'll not get out of here alive, Orgill.

32:35.342 --> 32:36.889
My name is Bailey.

32:36.919 --> 32:39.119
And if I'm not getting out of here alive...

32:39.149 --> 32:41.284
then neither is this one.

33:00.318 --> 33:02.187
Detective Scanlon.

33:02.217 --> 33:04.922
I know we got off to
a bit of a rough start,

33:04.924 --> 33:06.996
but uh... I just want to say
it's been a pleasure, Sir.

33:07.026 --> 33:08.255
The same, Constable.

33:08.285 --> 33:09.514
And should you find yourself in London

33:09.544 --> 33:11.393
someday, there will be
a drink waiting for you.

33:11.423 --> 33:13.640
Well, then I plan to find
myself in London some day, Sir.

33:13.670 --> 33:15.119
Good.

33:16.872 --> 33:17.812
Four.

33:17.842 --> 33:19.008
Five.

33:19.326 --> 33:20.472
Six.

33:20.711 --> 33:22.895
Uh, that's cheating, Detective.

33:23.134 --> 33:25.399
This game confounds me.

33:25.429 --> 33:27.152
As does this case.

33:27.182 --> 33:29.381
You insist on remaining skeptical.

33:29.411 --> 33:30.847
May I join you?

33:31.584 --> 33:33.451
I have trouble with the unresolved.

33:33.453 --> 33:35.253
So do I. I'd rather have seen Orgill have

33:35.255 --> 33:38.215
his day in court, then watched him hang.

33:38.423 --> 33:40.112
These are the suspect's clothing.

33:40.142 --> 33:41.464
Don't have a trace of blood on them,

33:41.494 --> 33:43.536
even under ultraviolet light.

33:43.566 --> 33:45.815
He could simply have
disposed of his clothing.

33:45.845 --> 33:47.063
Possibly.

33:47.093 --> 33:50.107
But then there's Dr. Robert's
portrait of the killer.

33:50.137 --> 33:53.536
Hardly the meticulous
planner I would have expected.

33:53.566 --> 33:56.261
And then there's the method
of sexual gratification.

33:56.291 --> 33:58.490
True, he was an observer and an onanist,

33:58.520 --> 34:01.374
but that doesn't rule him out
from being a murderer also.

34:01.404 --> 34:05.315
So you truly suspect the
killer remains at large?

34:05.347 --> 34:06.511
I do.

34:07.065 --> 34:09.076
And I believe the secret
to catching him is finding

34:09.106 --> 34:11.507
the connection between the two victims.

34:11.509 --> 34:14.074
A connection in no way
precludes mister Orgill

34:14.077 --> 34:16.538
and mister Bailey being one and the same.

34:16.568 --> 34:19.170
You must admit that is
a very real possibility.

34:20.685 --> 34:22.215
Well, I'll concede that.

34:22.245 --> 34:23.480
Regardless of what you or I might think,

34:23.510 --> 34:25.982
Scotland Yard considers the case closed.

34:26.012 --> 34:28.842
Well, I really must be off,
but just one last throw.

34:30.487 --> 34:32.226
One. Two. Three.

34:35.281 --> 34:37.766
Curse my luck, Detective.

34:38.940 --> 34:42.242
Oh, there is one other
thing that occurs to me.

34:42.472 --> 34:43.955
If there is a connection,

34:43.985 --> 34:46.826
might it have something to do
with the fact that neither woman

34:46.856 --> 34:48.658
was from Toronto?

34:49.902 --> 34:51.255
You have a point.

34:51.286 --> 34:53.077
I shall follow up, Detective.

34:53.523 --> 34:54.958
Goodbye, Detective Murdoch.

34:54.987 --> 34:56.969
Goodbye, Detective Scanlon.

35:06.631 --> 35:08.032
George?

35:08.034 --> 35:09.256
Sir?

35:09.569 --> 35:11.554
Has Mrs. Moffat returned home yet?

35:11.584 --> 35:14.271
Uh no, I believe she's still
staying with the sister.

35:15.310 --> 35:16.522
Mrs. Moffat.

35:16.552 --> 35:19.206
You said Alberta recently
moved to the city?

35:19.236 --> 35:20.165
Yes.

35:20.195 --> 35:22.179
Where did she first find employment?

35:22.181 --> 35:24.267
At the hospital straight away.

35:24.474 --> 35:26.672
Alberta always wanted to help the poor,

35:26.702 --> 35:28.851
so that's why she chose St. Michael's.

35:28.853 --> 35:30.442
On account of the sister' work.

35:30.472 --> 35:32.354
I see. So she came to the city

35:32.384 --> 35:33.740
to start work at St. Michael's.

35:33.770 --> 35:35.222
And she moved into a boarding house.

35:35.252 --> 35:37.023
- Oh no.
- She didn't?

35:37.053 --> 35:38.936
Alberta had gumption.

35:39.525 --> 35:41.881
She just thought she'd find some place.

35:41.883 --> 35:44.083
So where did she live then?

35:44.085 --> 35:47.119
Well, there's only one place
that'll help a young lady out

35:47.121 --> 35:50.087
when she's first getting
started, isn't there?

35:52.924 --> 35:53.959
Dr. Ogden.

35:53.989 --> 35:56.668
Detective Scanlon, how can I help you?

35:56.698 --> 35:58.992
I just came to say farewell.

35:59.022 --> 36:02.425
With Mr. Orgill deceased, it seems
that it's time for me to return home.

36:02.455 --> 36:04.054
Tomorrow, in fact.

36:04.056 --> 36:05.990
This must be a huge relief for you.

36:06.020 --> 36:07.638
Yes, yes, it is.

36:07.941 --> 36:09.784
It's been so much a part
of my life I'm not sure

36:09.814 --> 36:11.261
what I'll do with myself.

36:11.263 --> 36:12.863
I'm sure you'll find something.

36:13.338 --> 36:15.198
I'd like to apologize
again for my behaviour.

36:15.200 --> 36:17.692
If you would... I'd very much
like to make it up to you.

36:17.722 --> 36:19.014
Really, that's not necessary.

36:19.044 --> 36:20.038
No, please.

36:20.068 --> 36:22.205
Please, allow me to take you to dinner.

36:22.480 --> 36:25.754
Oh, well, I would like that very much,

36:25.784 --> 36:28.853
but I... unfortunately I have a lot
of work ahead of me this evening.

36:28.883 --> 36:30.205
I understand.

36:31.851 --> 36:33.556
It's been a pleasure, Dr. Ogden.

36:33.586 --> 36:35.343
Hopefully we'll have the
opportunity to meet again

36:35.373 --> 36:37.121
under better circumstances.

36:37.151 --> 36:38.650
I hope so too.

36:46.000 --> 36:47.992
Miss Ross... both Alberta Moffat

36:48.022 --> 36:50.899
and Gloria Ambercrombie stayed
here at one time, did they not?

36:50.929 --> 36:54.683
God rest their souls, yes. But
Alberta had moved out a month ago.

36:54.713 --> 36:57.572
You aren't suggesting that somehow the YWCA

36:57.602 --> 36:59.886
is involved in these murders?

36:59.916 --> 37:02.388
No, but it is a common point
between the two victims.

37:02.802 --> 37:04.519
Who had access to your records?

37:04.549 --> 37:06.910
We are very strict about the
privacy of the women who stay here.

37:06.940 --> 37:08.198
Of course. I didn't mean to imply.

37:08.228 --> 37:12.027
Besides I thought you
would already be aware.

37:12.984 --> 37:14.131
I'm sorry, I don't understand.

37:14.161 --> 37:15.804
Well, the only person
who's examined our files

37:15.834 --> 37:17.366
was one of your men.

37:17.396 --> 37:20.595
- My men?
- Yes. One of your officers.

37:21.113 --> 37:22.882
Can you describe this officer?

37:47.209 --> 37:49.024
So the killer impersonates a copper,

37:49.054 --> 37:50.472
goes to the YWCA,

37:50.502 --> 37:53.109
supposedly investigating a
deviant loose in the area.

37:53.139 --> 37:55.929
Yes. And in doing so, he
acquires a list of young

37:55.959 --> 37:58.112
women and where they worked.

37:58.142 --> 37:59.370
The victims.

37:59.372 --> 38:00.908
Do we have a description of the suspect?

38:00.938 --> 38:01.749
Yes.

38:01.779 --> 38:04.076
And I also have one of his fingermarks.

38:04.106 --> 38:05.821
Fingermark? From where?

38:05.851 --> 38:08.478
It was left behind in the
carriage by the killer.

38:08.508 --> 38:09.817
How do we know it's the killer's?

38:09.847 --> 38:13.805
Because it matches one left behind
on the snakes and ladders board.

38:15.100 --> 38:17.156
But only our officers
have touched that game.

38:17.186 --> 38:18.446
Precisely.

38:18.476 --> 38:21.424
The killer isn't
impersonating a police officer.

38:21.454 --> 38:22.954
He's one of ours.

38:22.984 --> 38:26.257
Who? 'Cause I'll personally put
the bloody noose around his neck.

38:26.287 --> 38:27.755
Edward Scanlon.

38:27.785 --> 38:29.024
Scanlon, are you sure?

38:29.054 --> 38:31.781
Sir, he left a fingermark
on the carriage yet told me

38:31.811 --> 38:34.016
the men never allowed him access.

38:34.046 --> 38:36.326
Plus it would explain some things.

38:36.356 --> 38:39.303
Imagine a carriage pulls
alongside a young woman.

38:39.333 --> 38:41.678
Scanlon shows her his badge.

38:41.949 --> 38:43.322
She jumps in.

38:43.689 --> 38:45.856
Bloody hell. We've let him
slip through our fingers.

38:45.886 --> 38:47.752
I don't think he's gone far, Sir.

38:47.782 --> 38:49.760
He always strikes eight times.

38:49.790 --> 38:52.347
That leaves him with a fair
bit of unfinished business.

38:52.377 --> 38:54.100
I want every man on the
job until he's found.

38:54.130 --> 38:55.433
Cancel all leave.

38:55.463 --> 38:58.013
I'll take a look into Mr. Scanlon's past.

39:32.148 --> 39:34.133
I just received a telegram
from Scotland Yard.

39:34.163 --> 39:36.330
It seems there was a
Detective Edward Scanlon

39:36.360 --> 39:39.037
and he was tracking a suspected
killer named Harlan Orgill.

39:39.067 --> 39:39.943
Was?

39:39.973 --> 39:42.369
He was found murdered
in a hotel room in Cairo.

39:42.399 --> 39:45.026
So Orgill kills Scanlon
and assumes his personae.

39:45.056 --> 39:46.885
Sir. I was just by Scanlon's hotel.

39:46.915 --> 39:48.187
He checked out about an hour ago.

39:48.217 --> 39:49.052
Bloody hell.

39:49.082 --> 39:50.235
Well, he may not have gone far.

39:50.265 --> 39:51.573
The doorman seemed to think he was sick.

39:51.603 --> 39:52.449
Sick?

39:52.479 --> 39:54.264
Said something about
paying a visit to a doctor.

39:54.647 --> 39:57.101
A murderer kills unabated
and at every turn...

39:57.131 --> 39:58.626
I am met with indifference.

39:58.656 --> 39:59.391
All the women worked.

39:59.421 --> 40:01.838
It's not that I'm disagreeing
with you, Detective.

40:01.868 --> 40:03.742
- Doctor Ogden.
- A working woman.

40:03.772 --> 40:05.964
Go on, move it.

40:23.558 --> 40:24.482
Oh...

40:24.512 --> 40:25.980
Mr. Scanlon.

40:26.522 --> 40:27.877
You gave me quite the fright.

40:31.166 --> 40:32.520
Did I?

40:39.641 --> 40:41.473
Is there something I can do for you?

40:41.503 --> 40:42.603
Yes, Doctor.

40:43.752 --> 40:44.932
There is.

41:04.260 --> 41:05.965
Doctor Ogden, are you here?

41:05.995 --> 41:07.750
You two go that way.

41:15.949 --> 41:17.017
Julia!

41:17.622 --> 41:20.061
Julia, are you all right?

41:22.517 --> 41:23.505
Murdoch!

41:23.535 --> 41:24.748
Crabtree!

41:28.520 --> 41:30.161
I'm fine.

41:38.358 --> 41:39.569
Murdoch.

41:40.700 --> 41:42.279
Mr. Orgill.

41:42.550 --> 41:46.987
When I first came here, I thought
it would be you who stopped me.

41:48.103 --> 41:49.824
I was wrong.

41:51.847 --> 41:56.446
Tell Dr. Ogden, "thank you".

42:11.112 --> 42:12.610
Julia.

42:18.855 --> 42:21.373
I didn't... I didn't mean to...

42:21.564 --> 42:22.616
No.

42:22.935 --> 42:25.381
You were simply defending yourself.

42:27.899 --> 42:29.907
I think I need to go home now.

42:29.937 --> 42:32.632
Yes, of course. I'll see you safely there.

42:42.811 --> 42:43.979
I know this sounds ghoulish...

42:43.981 --> 42:46.787
But part of me wishes
that Orgill had survived.

42:46.817 --> 42:49.002
At least long enough for
me to have spoken with him.

42:49.032 --> 42:50.811
Yes, there was much to learn from him.

42:50.841 --> 42:52.292
- Do you think?
- I do.

42:52.322 --> 42:54.722
Well, our experiment
didn't really exactly help

42:54.724 --> 42:55.899
solve the case, did it?

42:55.929 --> 42:57.014
Oh, I'm not sure about that.

42:57.044 --> 42:58.960
It proved quite accurate in many ways.

42:58.962 --> 43:00.161
Oh?

43:00.163 --> 43:02.797
As we discussed, the Dr. Jeckyll portion of

43:02.799 --> 43:04.699
his mind did want to be caught.

43:04.701 --> 43:06.869
He provided me with the YWCA clue.

43:06.899 --> 43:08.622
He really was saying, "try to stop me".

43:08.652 --> 43:09.929
- Yes.
- And the number eight?

43:09.959 --> 43:11.864
Do you have any ideas as to its importance?

43:11.894 --> 43:13.617
My only thought is that
there were eight snakes

43:13.647 --> 43:14.936
on the snakes and ladders board.

43:14.966 --> 43:17.505
- Eight sins.
- Eight women to be punished.

43:17.535 --> 43:20.280
What those sins were, I
guess we'll never know.

43:20.310 --> 43:22.274
Perhaps their origins lie in his childhood,

43:22.304 --> 43:24.062
as you speculated.

43:24.092 --> 43:28.493
Or perhaps he was literally
just playing a game.

43:30.788 --> 43:32.239
Thank you, Dr. Roberts.

43:32.269 --> 43:35.191
I hope never to have to call on you
and your professional capacity again,

43:35.221 --> 43:37.470
but I suspect there will be reason.

43:37.500 --> 43:39.046
Any time, Detective.

43:49.463 --> 43:51.485
Ah, Detective. I was
worried you had given up.

43:51.515 --> 43:53.190
Your abilities are not that bad.

43:53.220 --> 43:54.837
I appreciate your faith, Professor.

43:54.867 --> 43:56.670
And I appreciate a challenge.

43:56.700 --> 43:58.407
Your partner, Dr. Ogden?

43:58.437 --> 44:00.527
Uh, we had an incident at work.

44:00.557 --> 44:02.359
I'm afraid she won't be making it tonight.

44:02.389 --> 44:04.115
In fact, she may not be here for some time.

44:04.145 --> 44:06.298
I think you are mistaken.

44:08.924 --> 44:12.446
Ladies and gentlemen,
let us begin with a waltz.

44:29.518 --> 44:31.558
I must say I am surprised to see you here

44:31.588 --> 44:33.136
this evening, Julia.

44:33.241 --> 44:35.618
Yes, well, I just thought tonight,

44:35.648 --> 44:39.347
more than any night, I would
very much like to be held.
