I heard you need some sex tips.

03:46.781 --> 03:48.338
Except for the people I already told.

- Ugh.

take it when nobody's looking.

It's not mine!

Dr. Tate, have you heard
anything from Mrs. Buckley?

04:30.853 --> 04:32.769
No, I haven't, and I'm quite worried.

04:32.805 --> 04:34.105
I received a frantic,

04:34.141 --> 04:36.408

he'd done something horrible.

04:38.603 --> 04:40.170

04:40.206 --> 04:42.573
and he said he was in the park
near the Zen garden.

04:42.609 --> 04:45.377
I suspected he was just
experiencing delusions,

04:45.413 --> 04:47.547

for therapy today,

04:47.583 --> 04:48.856
I became very concerned.

04:48.892 --> 04:50.059

Yes, we see a lot of darkness
in our line of work,

05:05.609 --> 05:07.510
and humor is one
of our coping mechanisms.

05:07.546 --> 05:09.283

05:19.384 --> 05:20.711
Okay, Doc, you're not in your office.

05:20.747 --> 05:23.148
You don't have to use words
like "triggered" or "in denial."

05:23.184 --> 05:25.484
I didn't say "in denial."
Are you in denial?

05:25.520 --> 05:27.954
No, I am not,
and before you say anything,

05:27.990 --> 05:29.757
I don't want to sleep
with my mom either.

05:29.793 --> 05:31.690
Now, why would you
bring that up unprompted?

05:31.726 --> 05:32.925
What? You prompted it.

new yarn you're using.

- I noticed.

who found the body.

05:52.829 --> 05:55.417
And our chief suspect,
James Buckley, has disappeared.

05:55.453 --> 05:57.220
But he has no motive,
no criminal record,

to his credit card statement,

05:58.625 --> 06:00.577
had just purchased two sombreros.

06:00.613 --> 06:01.746
Kind of weird to give someone a sombrero

06:03.123 --> 06:05.081
Well, both <i>sombreros</i>

It's always good
to have a backup <i>sombrero.</i>

- like <i>sombrero?</i>
- Yes.

to pronounce it the wrong way.

Look, I think James is a good suspect.

06:14.292 --> 06:15.725
We have Dr. Tate's notebooks,

that he's been having

for the last few months.

blindly trust Dr. Tate?

He's a creepy therapist. They all are.

Lots of them. My cousin Pam has a couch

Yes! Decidedly so.

07:39.744 --> 07:41.477
A quick therapy session.
We talked about so much.

07:41.512 --> 07:42.812
Did you know that I have a tendency

07:42.847 --> 07:44.514
- to be unconsciously sexual?
- Yes.

07:44.549 --> 07:45.515
It's a real tough nut to bust.

07:45.550 --> 07:47.016
Oh, you're doing it again.

07:47.051 --> 07:48.484
Oh, okay, I think I hear it.

07:48.519 --> 07:49.852
- You think you hear it?
- Mm-hmm.

07:49.887 --> 07:51.722
Whatever, let's just do this, okay?

07:51.758 --> 07:53.191
NYPD, open up.

07:54.592 --> 07:56.726
[knocks on door] That's weird.

07:56.761 --> 07:58.361
- The door's unlocked.
- That's too bad.

07:58.396 --> 07:59.595
I love watching you pound one out.

07:59.630 --> 08:01.364
- Charles.
- What? That was sexual?

08:01.399 --> 08:02.665
- Which part?
- All of the parts!

08:02.700 --> 08:03.854
All right, you stay here.

08:03.890 --> 08:05.034
Charles, we're going in.

08:10.045 --> 08:11.620
- Bedroom's clear.
- The kitchen's clear.

08:11.656 --> 08:13.042
Did you see anything suspicious?

08:13.077 --> 08:14.277
Nothing, except for these

08:14.312 --> 08:16.090
laughing Jesus paintings everywhere.

08:16.747 --> 08:18.448
- Why is he in front of a tepee?
- I don't know.

08:18.484 --> 08:20.417
The one in the kitchen has him
at the last supper,

08:20.453 --> 08:22.353
but all the apostles
are McDonald's characters.

08:22.389 --> 08:23.952
- Which one's Judas?
- BOTH: The Hamburglar.

You check the bathroom?

08:25.823 --> 08:27.423

Well, Dr. Tate,

08:33.078 --> 08:34.068
we will meet you back at the car.

08:34.104 --> 08:36.076
We just want to check some
things out for one more minute.

08:36.734 --> 08:38.201
- Did you notice that?
- The painting in the bathroom

08:38.236 --> 08:39.340
of Jesus standing over a vent

08:39.376 --> 08:40.808
with his robe blowing up
like Marilyn Monroe?

08:40.845 --> 08:42.937
No. Dr. Tate is the killer.

08:44.065 --> 08:45.372
- Hey, Santiago.
- Hey.

08:45.408 --> 08:47.743
Can you help me put up
these flyers around the office?

08:47.778 --> 08:48.755
Mm-hmm.

08:53.105 --> 08:54.204
Terry, come on.

08:54.240 --> 08:55.740
Nobody cares about your sex life.

08:55.776 --> 08:56.909
Just take the book home.

08:56.945 --> 08:59.146
[laughing]

08:59.357 --> 09:01.591
Take someone else's book home?

09:01.626 --> 09:03.626
That's stealing and mail fraud.

09:03.661 --> 09:05.731
I can't believe
you would even suggest that.

09:05.767 --> 09:07.034
Look, I think it's so great

09:07.070 --> 09:08.262
that you've been married so long

09:08.298 --> 09:09.931
and want to keep it fresh.

09:09.967 --> 09:12.668
I hope Jake does that for me if
our sex life ever takes a dip.

09:12.703 --> 09:14.503
Dip? Oh, there is no dip.

09:14.538 --> 09:16.739
- Just ask Sharon.
- Oh, no, please.

09:16.774 --> 09:18.574
I don't want to do that.
That's not necessary.

09:18.609 --> 09:20.564
- It's okay. I believe you.
- Hey, hon.

09:21.112 --> 09:23.930
Yeah, could you tell Amy
how good I am in bed?

09:23.970 --> 09:25.704
Because I'm a sex machine who...

09:25.740 --> 09:27.120
Oh, on speaker?

09:28.078 --> 09:30.905
Oh, hey, girls. How was school?

09:31.289 --> 09:32.788
Why do you think
Dr. Tate's the murderer?

09:32.823 --> 09:34.156
He already knew where the bathroom was.

09:34.191 --> 09:35.658
He's clearly been here before.

09:35.693 --> 09:37.994
Well, he probably just
guessed, because it's obvious.

09:38.029 --> 09:39.095
This is New York.

09:39.314 --> 09:40.614
It's never obvious
where the bathroom is.

09:40.650 --> 09:42.150
I once had an apartment where the toilet

09:42.186 --> 09:43.633
was literally in the refrigerator.

09:43.668 --> 09:45.668
I bet he was sleeping with Susan.

09:45.703 --> 09:47.503
Therapists are always having
affairs with their patients.

09:47.538 --> 09:48.971
- That's not true.
- Oh, really?

09:49.006 --> 09:50.673
Tell that to the ten minutes
of "Bikini Shrink"

09:50.708 --> 09:52.775
I watched on Cinemax when I was 13.

09:52.810 --> 09:54.477
Dr. Juggs was insatiable.

09:54.512 --> 09:56.512
James was ill. We have months of notes

09:56.547 --> 09:57.980
saying he was increasingly unstable.

09:58.015 --> 09:59.882
First of all, people with mental illness

09:59.917 --> 10:01.684
are much more likely to be the
victims than the perpetrators.

10:01.719 --> 10:03.486
I heard that on NPR
when I was in the room

10:03.521 --> 10:04.987
- while Amy was listening to NPR.
- Ah.

10:05.022 --> 10:07.657
And second, I bet
Dr. Tate's notes are fake.

10:07.692 --> 10:09.278
I mean, you know what
was in Dr. Juggs's notes?

10:09.314 --> 10:10.726
- What?
- Stick figures doing it.

10:10.761 --> 10:12.737
- What does that prove?
- I don't know, but it was hot.

10:13.197 --> 10:15.331
All I'm saying is, something
feels suspicious to me here.

10:15.366 --> 10:16.799
Maybe we should go to Dr. Tate's office

10:16.834 --> 10:18.301
and see if we can find
the missing notebooks.

10:18.336 --> 10:19.468
Wait, you're basing this all on the fact

10:19.503 --> 10:21.170
that he knew where a bathroom was?

10:21.205 --> 10:23.372
And his DNA was at the scene
where we discovered the body.

10:23.407 --> 10:24.740
[gasps] I bet that's why

10:24.775 --> 10:26.475
he insisted on coming
with us to the park.

10:26.510 --> 10:28.177
You've been weird
about Dr. Tate from the start.

10:28.212 --> 10:29.345
To me, the evidence suggests

10:29.380 --> 10:30.880
that James killed his wife and fled.

10:30.915 --> 10:33.123
It's my case, and that's
the lead we're following.

10:34.051 --> 10:35.084
Okay.

10:35.219 --> 10:36.519
You're right. I'm sorry.

10:36.554 --> 10:38.254
I was being unfair. It's your case.

10:38.289 --> 10:39.522
You call in an APB,

10:39.557 --> 10:40.823
and I will meet you back
at the precinct.

10:40.858 --> 10:42.265
I'm just gonna swing by the bank.

10:42.301 --> 10:43.693
You're not gonna go to Dr. Tate's office

10:43.728 --> 10:44.860
and search it behind my back, are you?

10:44.895 --> 10:45.695
What? Charles, no.

10:45.730 --> 10:47.266
I wouldn't do that. You can trust me.

10:47.302 --> 10:49.162
- Okay, I trust you.
- Good. You should.

10:49.198 --> 10:50.558
- Well, I do.
- Great, because you can.

10:50.594 --> 10:51.734
- I feel good about it.
- Good, you should.

10:51.769 --> 10:53.102
I think it's the right choice.

10:53.137 --> 10:54.690
You're making the right call
by trusting me.

10:54.939 --> 10:55.972
Not.

10:56.172 --> 10:57.705
"Wayne's World." Sweet.

10:57.975 --> 10:59.975
[lock clicks]

11:03.976 --> 11:05.109
All right, think.

11:05.493 --> 11:06.988
Where would I hide the real notebook

11:07.024 --> 11:08.557
if I was a creepy therapist?

11:08.678 --> 11:10.578
In my butt. [chuckles]

11:10.905 --> 11:12.272
Focus, Jake.

11:12.307 --> 11:13.856
Now is not the time for being hilarious.

11:14.667 --> 11:17.201
[faint rustling]

11:20.435 --> 11:23.115
What have we here?

11:23.985 --> 11:25.885
James and Susan Buckley.

11:25.920 --> 11:28.321
[voices in hallway]

11:30.992 --> 11:32.425
So your day's been going well?

11:32.460 --> 11:34.260
- It has, it has.
- They're blocking my way out.

11:34.295 --> 11:36.029
A cancellation, and so I was able

11:36.064 --> 11:37.864
to get more work done.

11:37.899 --> 11:39.299
Yeah. Well, that's always nice.

11:39.334 --> 11:40.867
Same thing happened to me yesterday.

11:40.902 --> 11:43.569
- Is that right?
- Yeah, two cancellations.

11:43.604 --> 11:46.306
You know? At least it wasn't three.

11:46.341 --> 11:47.874
- [laughs]
- Have a good afternoon.

11:47.909 --> 11:48.875
- You too.
- Okay.

11:48.910 --> 11:50.410
See you in the morning.

11:50.445 --> 11:52.315
Oh, um, can I help you?

11:52.351 --> 11:53.351
Yes.

11:53.688 --> 11:55.541
I am...

11:56.818 --> 11:57.884
your new patient.

11:57.919 --> 11:59.232
- Garrett?
- Garrett...

11:59.787 --> 12:00.920
is my name, yes.

12:00.955 --> 12:02.455
You're an hour and a half early.

12:02.490 --> 12:05.258
I know. I have problems
with time management.

12:05.293 --> 12:06.960
That's the issue I want to talk about.

12:06.995 --> 12:08.728
On the phone,
you said you were concerned

12:08.763 --> 12:10.330
you might have
multiple personality disorder.

12:10.365 --> 12:11.817
Yep, that too.

12:11.853 --> 12:13.333
Got buttloads of peeps
living in my brain,

12:13.368 --> 12:14.834
no doubt, no doubt, no doubt,
no doubt, no doubt.

12:14.869 --> 12:15.809
We should talk about it.

12:16.205 --> 12:18.672
I can't believe it's taken
so long for us to meet.

12:18.708 --> 12:19.974
You're so nice.

12:20.010 --> 12:21.310
Oh, I don't know about that, Jocelyn.

12:21.346 --> 12:22.646
I'm just being myself.

12:22.682 --> 12:24.215
Well, you're very sweet

12:24.251 --> 12:25.911
about the cosmetology thing.

12:25.947 --> 12:27.847
A lot of people are dismissive
of hairstylists.

12:27.882 --> 12:29.282
It makes no sense.

12:29.317 --> 12:31.250
If we didn't have hairstylists
to cut our hair,

12:31.285 --> 12:32.919
our hair would be far too long.

12:32.954 --> 12:34.954
- [laughs]
- Wow, great compliment.

12:34.989 --> 12:36.322
Hey, you're the girl

12:36.357 --> 12:37.957
from the diarrhea commercial,
aren't you?

12:37.992 --> 12:39.325
You get diarrhea on the plane.

12:39.360 --> 12:40.860
- That's not true.
- Yeah, move along.

12:40.895 --> 12:42.628
I don't get diarrhea on the plane.

12:42.663 --> 12:44.298
I get diarrhea in the airport.

12:46.384 --> 12:47.609
What's going on?

12:47.979 --> 12:50.969
Are you... an actor?

12:51.005 --> 12:53.306
Well, you don't have to
sound so grossed out.

12:53.341 --> 12:55.641
I can see why you didn't want
him meeting Jocelyn.

12:55.676 --> 12:57.443
- Excuse me?
- This isn't Jocelyn.

12:57.478 --> 12:59.112
It's Sheena. She's an actress.

12:59.147 --> 13:01.373
Yeah, I was in an episode of "SVU."

13:01.409 --> 13:03.049
I say, "We want answers."

13:03.084 --> 13:04.417
The director tried to replace me,

13:04.452 --> 13:06.719
but Mariska said
it would take too much time,

13:06.754 --> 13:09.288
and then they all agreed
I'd probably cut together fine.

13:09.323 --> 13:12.325
Look, Diaz, I've obviously
misread our relationship.

13:12.360 --> 13:14.227
You didn't want me to meet
the real Jocelyn

13:14.262 --> 13:17.663
because we're not as close
as I thought we were, so...

13:18.653 --> 13:19.764
message received.

13:23.351 --> 13:24.918
Hey, so you don't by any chance

13:24.954 --> 13:26.154
need any molly, do you?

13:26.190 --> 13:28.057
- I'm a cop.
- And scene.

13:28.093 --> 13:30.932
Now I'm out of character,
and I don't sell any drugs.

13:30.968 --> 13:31.967
I am leaving.

13:32.146 --> 13:33.279
So, Garrett,

13:33.314 --> 13:34.680
where would you like to begin?

13:34.715 --> 13:36.983
You know what,
can we crack the door a little?

13:37.018 --> 13:38.618
I get very claustrophobic,

13:38.653 --> 13:41.354
probably from all the different
people living in my head.

13:41.389 --> 13:43.256
We usually keep it closed for privacy,

13:43.291 --> 13:45.003
but whatever makes you comfortable.

13:45.039 --> 13:46.011
Thank you.

13:48.829 --> 13:49.929
Damn it, he's still here.

13:49.964 --> 13:51.182
- Excuse me?
- Hmm?

13:51.355 --> 13:54.756
Uh, I was just talking
to another one of the voices.

13:54.792 --> 13:56.225
- Is it Tatiana?
- Who now?

13:56.261 --> 13:57.728
The mischievous
seven-year-old British girl

13:57.764 --> 13:59.064
you told me about on the phone?

13:59.100 --> 14:00.232
May I speak with her?

14:00.268 --> 14:02.045
Uh...

14:04.309 --> 14:05.422
[high-pitched British accent] Yes?

14:06.136 --> 14:07.590
Hello, Doctor.

14:08.182 --> 14:10.116
I'm from Wussex.

14:10.151 --> 14:11.617
Is that an actual place in England?

14:11.652 --> 14:12.818
How should I know?

14:12.853 --> 14:15.221
I'm just a little girl, I am, I am.

14:15.256 --> 14:17.290
Well, it's nice to speak
with you, Tatiana.

14:17.325 --> 14:19.959
Can I say hello to Brian,

14:19.994 --> 14:22.098
the bookkeeper from Central London?

14:23.331 --> 14:24.697
[in accent] Cheers, I'm Brian.

14:24.732 --> 14:27.633
I like bookkeeping
right in the middle of London.

14:27.668 --> 14:31.637
Did I tell you a full list
of my many personalities

14:31.672 --> 14:33.138
when I called you
on the ol' telly, innit?

14:33.174 --> 14:34.173
Yes, you did.

14:34.208 --> 14:36.482
And are any of 'em, hopefully,

14:37.245 --> 14:38.311
not from England?

14:38.346 --> 14:39.312
There's Geoffrey.

14:39.347 --> 14:40.913
You said he's Australian.

14:40.948 --> 14:43.642
Aww, crikey.

14:44.218 --> 14:46.151
Hey, Sarge. I saw the flyers.

14:47.221 --> 14:48.554
You really put a lot of them up, huh?

14:48.589 --> 14:50.223
I just want to make extra sure

14:50.258 --> 14:51.691
we find the real book-buyer.

14:51.726 --> 14:54.660
Do you think it's this
kind of overcompensation

14:54.695 --> 14:57.330
that's been making things
difficult in the bedroom?

14:57.365 --> 14:59.208
Oh, I don't compensate.

14:59.467 --> 15:01.295
I procreate. Three kids.

15:01.331 --> 15:03.502
Okay. Weird brag.

15:03.537 --> 15:05.871
Look, just take the book. Nobody cares.

15:05.906 --> 15:09.108
Hey, I just saw this.
I think you have my book.

15:09.143 --> 15:10.911
Oh, really?

15:12.046 --> 15:13.379
Told ya!

15:13.414 --> 15:15.047
But you're not even married, Scully.

15:15.082 --> 15:16.682
I'm in a committed relationship,

15:16.717 --> 15:18.584
and Cindy Shatz
says I'm a selfish lover.

15:18.619 --> 15:20.419
All right, well, what
about the protein powder?

15:20.454 --> 15:21.621
I'm trying to get ripped.

15:21.656 --> 15:22.855
I drink, like, six shakes a day,

15:22.890 --> 15:24.090
but nothing's happening.

15:24.125 --> 15:25.358
- Do you also exercise?
- What?

15:25.393 --> 15:26.525
You're supposed to exercise?

15:26.560 --> 15:28.027
You know what, keep the powder.

15:28.062 --> 15:29.528
I'll drink normal milkshakes.

15:29.563 --> 15:32.131
And you thought that was my book.

15:32.166 --> 15:34.029
[laughs] Shame on you, Amy.

15:34.065 --> 15:35.287
Shame on you.

15:37.832 --> 15:39.241
You got the book?

15:42.176 --> 15:43.776
You should know,
things are good with Sharon.

15:43.811 --> 15:46.045
I just want to make sure we're
as happy in our relationship

15:46.080 --> 15:47.380
- as we can be.
- That's nice, Sarge.

15:47.415 --> 15:48.581
Sorry you had to embarrass yourself.

15:48.616 --> 15:49.715
Not a big deal.

15:49.750 --> 15:51.697
I guess I just don't care
what other people think of me.

15:51.733 --> 15:53.252
That's actually pretty inspiring.

15:53.287 --> 15:54.487
I wish I was more like that.

15:54.522 --> 15:55.853
Yeah. Now, if you'll excuse me...

15:56.424 --> 15:58.457
Whoa, whoa, whoa, hey, hey!

15:58.492 --> 15:59.827
You're not gonna wait for me to leave?

15:59.863 --> 16:02.694
Like I said, I just don't care.

16:04.531 --> 16:06.731
Well, Garrett, our time is up.

16:06.767 --> 16:08.067
Shall we pick up here next week?

16:08.102 --> 16:10.403
No, I can't go.

16:10.438 --> 16:14.307
There's still someone
left inside that wants to talk.

16:14.342 --> 16:15.508
Do you mean Satchel,

16:15.543 --> 16:17.977
the "gentle African-American man

16:18.012 --> 16:19.577
who was born in 1908"?

16:20.181 --> 16:22.515
Oh, no, you know what?

16:22.550 --> 16:24.116
Satchel probably shouldn't
come out right now.

16:24.151 --> 16:25.251
Or ever, for that matter.

16:25.286 --> 16:26.952
Garrett, I can only help you

16:26.987 --> 16:28.242
if you open up.

16:28.278 --> 16:30.344
[sighs]

16:31.292 --> 16:32.858

16:32.893 --> 16:36.917

of Shawshank Prison.

16:38.165 --> 16:39.498
He was my friend.

16:39.533 --> 16:41.399
Are you just doing Morgan Freeman?

16:42.169 --> 16:43.135
Ah, yes!

16:43.170 --> 16:44.437
You calling me on it

16:44.472 --> 16:45.705
just gave me a major breakthrough.

16:45.740 --> 16:47.817
I'm cured! Anyway, deuces, Doc!

16:56.717 --> 16:58.351
- Hello, Peralta.
- [screams]

16:58.386 --> 17:00.953
You really thought you could
sneak around my office

17:00.988 --> 17:02.288
without me noticing, huh?

17:02.323 --> 17:03.389
How'd you know I was in there?

17:03.424 --> 17:05.290
Your shampoo left an odor.

17:05.326 --> 17:06.659
I could smell you.

17:06.694 --> 17:09.859
I knew it! You're a Hannibal.

17:11.127 --> 17:13.262
Pull over right here. Cut the engine.

17:15.928 --> 17:17.288
Why are you doing this?

17:17.324 --> 17:18.824
Because you found my notebooks,

17:18.859 --> 17:22.226
and I assume you've deduced
what I did to Susan and James.

17:22.262 --> 17:23.962
- You killed James too?
- Oops.

17:23.998 --> 17:25.631
I guess you only deduced the Susan part.

17:25.666 --> 17:26.897
But it doesn't matter.

17:26.934 --> 17:29.003
You never would have thought
that James was a suspect.

17:29.039 --> 17:31.373
He was such a kind and gentle man.

17:31.409 --> 17:32.942
So why did you kill them?

17:32.978 --> 17:34.478
Well, because
they were gonna tell people

17:34.514 --> 17:37.148
about my affair with Susan
and ruin my career.

17:37.184 --> 17:38.884
- I knew it.
- I had to do it

17:38.920 --> 17:40.287
for the sake of my other patients.

17:40.323 --> 17:41.989
You know, there are a lot of people

17:42.025 --> 17:43.525
who depend on me for their well-being.

17:43.561 --> 17:45.562
Yeah, except for the ones
that you murder.

17:45.598 --> 17:48.065
- That's only happened twice.
- It's happened before?

17:48.101 --> 17:50.001
The Rothmans. Nobody misses them.

17:50.037 --> 17:51.971
You really are a terrible therapist.

17:52.007 --> 17:54.541
Oh, wow, strong words for someone

17:54.577 --> 17:57.745
who is clearly scared
to talk about his own issues.

17:57.781 --> 17:59.547
I'm not scared, okay?

17:59.583 --> 18:01.017
For example, I had an issue

18:01.053 --> 18:02.753
with texting while driving,
but I fixed it.

18:02.789 --> 18:04.891
Now I just don't look
at my phone while I type.

18:04.927 --> 18:05.893
Case in point.

18:05.929 --> 18:07.061
Just know that you died

18:07.097 --> 18:08.589

18:08.625 --> 18:10.014
Okay, okay, okay! Stop.

18:10.198 --> 18:11.531
Fine, you want something real?

18:11.567 --> 18:13.300
I tried therapy.
It only made things worse.

18:13.336 --> 18:14.836
Uh-huh. Go on.

18:14.872 --> 18:17.607
When I was a kid,
I was acting out at school,

18:17.643 --> 18:19.943
so they made me and my parents
do family counseling,

18:19.979 --> 18:22.046
but instead of helping me
with my problems,

18:22.082 --> 18:23.315
the stupid therapist just brought up

18:23.351 --> 18:24.618
all my parents' issues.

18:24.654 --> 18:26.287
And once it was all out in the open,

18:26.323 --> 18:27.889
they fought all the time
and eventually got divorced,

18:27.925 --> 18:31.394
and everything good in my life
just... went away.

18:31.430 --> 18:33.063
Interesting. So you actually

18:33.099 --> 18:35.533
blame yourself
for your parents' divorce?

18:35.569 --> 18:37.370
No, I blame the therapy,

18:37.406 --> 18:39.139
which we only had to do because I...

18:39.175 --> 18:40.408
oh, my God.

18:40.444 --> 18:41.848
I do blame myself.

Excuse me, do you have

18:50.968 --> 18:52.801
- I could trade you for?
- Of course I do.

18:52.837 --> 18:54.696
None of my dollars has a single crinkle.

18:54.732 --> 18:56.632
When they do, I steam them.

Oh. Wow, that is crisp.

They're for my girlfriend,
Detective Diaz.

What? No, I'm Denise.

19:12.192 --> 19:14.592
Who's Jocelyn? Is Rosa cheating on me?

19:14.628 --> 19:16.562
Oh, my...

19:16.714 --> 19:17.947
No, that was a joke.

I'm sorry, I thought it would be funny.

Oh, that was actually very funny.

19:23.890 --> 19:25.121
I didn't know what was happening,

19:25.157 --> 19:26.423
and then I thought
I knew what was happening,

19:26.459 --> 19:27.959
but what I thought I knew was happening

19:27.995 --> 19:30.138
wasn't what was happening.

19:30.174 --> 19:31.225
That's very good.

So this is Jocelyn?

I'm glad you got to meet her.
For the record,

19:43.579 --> 19:45.346
I wasn't keeping her from you
because I was afraid

19:45.382 --> 19:46.748
you were gonna hurt
her feelings by being judgy.

19:46.784 --> 19:48.365
I think it's hilarious
when you're judgy.

19:48.401 --> 19:50.476
It's because I was afraid
you weren't gonna like her.

19:50.584 --> 19:52.265
You and I are close, and I...

19:53.253 --> 19:54.519
I value your opinion.

19:54.555 --> 19:55.621
Well, she seems great,

19:55.657 --> 19:57.024

That would be great.

You might want to save your girlfriend.

She's talking to Hitchcock.

20:04.474 --> 20:05.874
Damn it, Hitchcock!

20:06.166 --> 20:07.732
So I joke about my father so much

20:07.768 --> 20:10.470

all the pain he's caused me.

20:10.506 --> 20:13.207
Yes. You are doing such great work here.

Now, I'm sorry, but our session
is coming to a close.

20:18.583 --> 20:20.817
I guess I'll have to bill your widow.

20:20.853 --> 20:22.487
Wow, that is cold-blooded,

20:22.523 --> 20:24.709
but I got to hand it to you,
it's a pretty dope kill line.

20:24.745 --> 20:26.546
Unfortunately, no one
will be billed, though.

20:26.582 --> 20:27.654
Isn't that right, Charles?

20:27.690 --> 20:29.624
- Hi, Dr. Tate!
- What? How did he...

Told you I could text
without looking at my phone.

20:32.502 --> 20:33.568

20:33.604 --> 20:35.504
Oh, man, I am so glad

20:35.540 --> 20:37.094
you got my message with the location.

20:37.130 --> 20:38.430
Pretty impressive, right?

20:38.466 --> 20:39.766
Well, actually, you just texted

20:39.802 --> 20:41.468
a bunch of crazy, weird, random letters.

20:41.504 --> 20:42.971
It made me concerned,
so I tracked your phone.

20:43.007 --> 20:44.940
Well, still pretty good.
I found you in my contacts.

20:44.976 --> 20:46.339
It went to Amy. She forwarded it to me.

20:46.375 --> 20:47.808
It worked. Let's stop talking about it.

20:47.844 --> 20:48.993
Listen, I'm sorry.

20:49.029 --> 20:50.431
I guess you were right
about the therapist.

Yeah, well, that's nice
of you to say, Charles,

20:52.604 --> 20:55.738
but actually,
when I was stalling Dr. Tate,

20:55.774 --> 20:57.908
I started talking
about my parents' divorce,

20:57.944 --> 21:00.145
and it felt really good.

21:00.181 --> 21:01.781
I can't believe
I'm gonna say this, but...

21:01.989 --> 21:03.638
I think I'm gonna make
an appointment with a shrink.

21:03.674 --> 21:05.587
Jake, that is so great.

21:05.629 --> 21:07.662

Okay.
