00:51.417 --> 00:56.218
- You're always sick.
- You were sick when you were my age.

00:59.158 --> 01:02.559
- Evening, sir.
- Evening, Victor.

01:03.295 --> 01:05.889
I didn't realize you were still here.

01:06.632 --> 01:10.398
I was just keeping James company, sir,
if that's all right.

01:12.237 --> 01:13.898
Very kind of you.

01:15.107 --> 01:17.837
- Any better, Son?
- Still cold, Father.

01:18.410 --> 01:19.741
Just a mild fever.

01:19.812 --> 01:23.043
- You'll be all right in the morning.
- You always say that.

01:23.115 --> 01:25.413
And you always pull through, don't you?

01:25.484 --> 01:28.920
- Yeah.
- Now, you taking your medicine?

01:30.689 --> 01:33.453
Elizabeth! Elizabeth!

01:34.126 --> 01:36.390
- Your father's drunk again.
- Elizabeth!

01:36.462 --> 01:40.831
- You should help him home, Victor.
- It's not my name he's calling, sir.

01:42.367 --> 01:44.096
- Father!
- Stay where you are, James.

01:44.169 --> 01:46.069
- Get off me!
- Father!

01:47.039 --> 01:49.234
Now! You never loved him!

01:50.209 --> 01:52.370
I told you never to come back here.

01:59.218 --> 02:00.617
Get out!

02:12.097 --> 02:13.689
James?

02:18.770 --> 02:21.295
- No.
- James?

02:22.407 --> 02:24.307
- There are things you don't understand.
- Don't.

02:24.376 --> 02:26.003
- I need him to know!
- Please don't.

02:26.078 --> 02:28.046
- No more lies.
- James...

02:45.998 --> 02:47.829
- No!
- James!

02:53.438 --> 02:56.635
He... He wasn't your father,

03:04.983 --> 03:06.314
Son.

03:15.027 --> 03:16.619
What are you?

03:31.710 --> 03:35.009
- I didn't mean it! I didn't mean it!
- Yes, you did!

03:36.014 --> 03:39.040
He deserved it, and you gave it to him.

03:42.154 --> 03:44.884
We're brothers, Jimmy. You realize that?

03:45.490 --> 03:47.890
And brothers protect each other.

03:48.193 --> 03:51.959
You have to be hard now,
hard so nothing can ever touch us.

03:53.098 --> 03:55.589
- I want to go home.
- We can't.

03:56.001 --> 03:58.265
We stick together, no matter what,

03:58.337 --> 04:01.500
and take care of anyone
who gets in our way.

04:01.573 --> 04:04.064
Can you do that, little brother?

04:06.078 --> 04:08.876
- I'm going down to the river.
- They're coming.

04:08.947 --> 04:11.780
- Head over the hill. Hurry!
- Can you run?

04:15.320 --> 04:19.689
- Keep on running and don't look back.
- Okay.

05:22.287 --> 05:23.754
Back to back!

06:20.979 --> 06:22.503
That's enough!

06:25.083 --> 06:26.345
Enough!

06:39.598 --> 06:41.122
No! No!

06:42.367 --> 06:44.198
Stand down, soldier!

06:49.975 --> 06:51.408
Victor!

06:54.513 --> 06:55.980
Stand down! Stand down!

06:56.047 --> 06:58.345
Stand down!

07:01.853 --> 07:03.047
No!

07:29.181 --> 07:32.082
Ready, aim...

07:32.684 --> 07:34.481
Wake me when it's over.

07:43.962 --> 07:45.020
...fire!

07:51.136 --> 07:54.435
Freaks! You're animals! Freaks!

07:54.506 --> 07:56.838
My name is Major William Stryker.

07:56.908 --> 08:00.071
You've been charged
with killing a senior officer.

08:00.145 --> 08:02.079
Is that correct?

08:02.147 --> 08:04.308
Apparently, we have some issues
with authority...

08:04.382 --> 08:07.078
- Just keep a lid on it.
...sir.

08:08.186 --> 08:11.019
The warden tells me that your sentence
was carried out by a firing squad

08:11.089 --> 08:12.954
at 1000 hours.

08:13.024 --> 08:15.219
- How'd that go?
- It tickled.

08:20.198 --> 08:24.635
You boys tired of running?
Tired of denying your true nature?

08:25.637 --> 08:28.071
- What do you care?
- Oh, I care.

08:28.874 --> 08:31.434
I care because I know how special you are.

08:31.510 --> 08:33.205
How valuable.

08:37.082 --> 08:41.451
Look, you can stay here
locked up like freaks of nature,

08:42.587 --> 08:44.384
or you can join me.

08:44.990 --> 08:49.120
I'm putting together a special team
with special privileges.

08:50.161 --> 08:54.495
Now, tell me, how would you like
to really serve your country?

09:08.647 --> 09:09.636
You know, I love this weapon

09:09.714 --> 09:11.238
more than any other thing
in the whole wide world.

09:11.316 --> 09:13.307
- Do you wanna know why?
- No.

09:14.085 --> 09:15.746
It's memorable.

09:15.820 --> 09:17.947
Sure, it's a little bulky,
tough to get on a plane.

09:18.023 --> 09:21.550
You whip out a couple of swords
at your ex-girlfriend's wedding,

09:21.626 --> 09:23.924
they will never, ever forget it.

09:23.995 --> 09:25.826
That's funny, Wade.

09:25.897 --> 09:29.264
I think you confuse me
with someone who gives a shit.

09:29.334 --> 09:32.098
Right, it's probably not
as intimidating as having a gun

09:32.170 --> 09:36.072
or bone claws
or the fingernails of a bag lady.

09:44.950 --> 09:48.010
- Manicure?
- Victor. Easy.

09:50.622 --> 09:53.386
Fred got a new tattoo. I'm concerned.

09:54.292 --> 09:57.284
Oh, Jesus, Fred,
you just met her last night.

09:57.529 --> 10:00.123
- I love her.
- You love her after one night?

10:00.198 --> 10:01.825
She's a gymnast.

10:03.201 --> 10:05.101
Bradley, take her down.

10:09.708 --> 10:11.801
Oh, God.

10:11.876 --> 10:13.810
- Are you gonna puke?
- If we were meant to fly,

10:13.878 --> 10:15.675
- we'd grow wings.
- Don't worry, Nancy.

10:15.747 --> 10:19.148
- More people die driving than flying.
- How about from impaling?

10:19.217 --> 10:22.345
Hey, be nice,
or be your approximation of nice.

10:23.855 --> 10:25.846
- Would you like a bucket?
- No.

10:25.924 --> 10:28.085
Gentlemen, wheels down in Lagos in five.

11:03.995 --> 11:08.159
- Why are we here?
- All in good time. Zero?

11:13.838 --> 11:17.899
- Intruder! Perimeter breach!
- Man the weapon!

11:19.177 --> 11:23.511
Intruder, stop!
Put your hands behind your head!

11:53.011 --> 11:54.569
Having fun yet?

11:59.651 --> 12:01.676
- Fred?
- The tank?

12:02.120 --> 12:04.884
- The tank.
- Yeah, I got that.

12:39.924 --> 12:44.327
Great. Stuck in an elevator
with five guys on a high-protein diet.

12:44.395 --> 12:46.226
- Wade.
- Dreams really do come true.

12:46.331 --> 12:47.389
Just shut it!

12:47.465 --> 12:50.457
- You're up next. - Thank you, sir.
You look really nice today.

12:50.535 --> 12:53.060
It's the green.
It brings out the seriousness in your eyes.

12:53.138 --> 12:57.097
- Oh, my God. Do you ever shut up, pal?
- No. Not when I'm awake.

12:57.976 --> 13:00.069
Bradley? Top floor, please.

13:08.520 --> 13:11.045
Cover the elevator! The elevator!

13:20.899 --> 13:22.730
Time to go to work.

13:59.370 --> 14:02.396
Okay. People are dead.

14:05.176 --> 14:09.408
If you didn't have that mouth on you,
Wade, you'd be the perfect soldier.

14:14.452 --> 14:17.250
I wouldn't do that if I was you, brother.

14:21.259 --> 14:25.821
- Take the diamonds. They're yours.
- I don't want your diamonds.

14:27.198 --> 14:28.631
I want this.

14:29.400 --> 14:32.335
But that is nothing. A souvenir.

14:33.071 --> 14:35.904
Where did you find it? I want the source.

14:36.908 --> 14:41.675
A small village, far inland,
three days from here.

14:44.182 --> 14:47.777
Tell him this rock is
more valuable to me than his life.

14:47.852 --> 14:49.911
Ask him where he found it.

15:00.665 --> 15:02.132
Okay.

15:03.234 --> 15:05.099
He says it came from the sky.

15:09.173 --> 15:11.141
He's telling the truth.

15:11.976 --> 15:13.807
You don't know the language, Logan.

15:13.878 --> 15:16.005
- It's a meteor fragment.
- I know what it is.

15:16.080 --> 15:18.480
I'm asking him where he found it.

15:18.549 --> 15:21.074
Sir, base wants to know our location.

15:21.152 --> 15:23.416
- Shut them down.
- Yes.

15:25.790 --> 15:27.849
Tell him everyone here will die

15:27.926 --> 15:30.895
unless he tells me
where he found the rock.

15:41.039 --> 15:43.701
- He says that it's sacred.
- Okay, fine.

15:47.478 --> 15:48.877
Victor.

16:05.897 --> 16:07.330
Victor!

16:10.935 --> 16:13.096
Don't even think about it.

16:14.505 --> 16:16.632
We didn't sign up for this.

16:20.211 --> 16:21.803
Put him down!

16:34.292 --> 16:36.089
What are you doing?

16:37.395 --> 16:39.886
We finally got a good thing going here.
Don't you screw this up.

16:39.964 --> 16:41.761
Enough. That's enough.
We've done enough.

16:41.833 --> 16:43.926
Who do you think you are?

16:44.268 --> 16:45.997
This is what we do.

16:46.771 --> 16:49.001
Maybe you'd rather be
rotting in a hole somewhere

16:49.073 --> 16:52.839
till they figure out a way to do it to us.
Is that it? Huh?

16:53.344 --> 16:54.777
I'm done.

16:57.215 --> 16:58.682
You coming?

17:05.323 --> 17:06.619
Jimmy!

17:12.063 --> 17:14.463
We can't just let you walk away.

17:23.007 --> 17:24.201
Jimmy!

17:27.111 --> 17:28.407
Jimmy!

18:17.829 --> 18:19.854
Why are you up so early?

18:22.467 --> 18:23.866
Come here.

19:02.406 --> 19:03.998
See you, baby.

19:05.176 --> 19:06.473
Hey.

19:13.351 --> 19:16.081
Oh, that's nice. Yes. Take your time.

19:18.122 --> 19:19.248
You're wrapped, man.

19:37.175 --> 19:40.042
Okay, I'm totally gonna get this.

19:42.213 --> 19:44.238
Nope. Come on.

19:45.850 --> 19:48.250
Oh, wow! Let's go on the Ferris wheel.

19:48.319 --> 19:49.752
- How does he do it?
- Come on.

19:49.820 --> 19:51.447
...amazing lady in a box!

20:00.565 --> 20:02.829
Swing the hammer, ring the bell!

20:02.900 --> 20:04.765
Hey, what do you do?

20:07.104 --> 20:09.334
If you turn off the light, you win a prize.

20:09.407 --> 20:13.104
- Three tries for a buck.
- Come on, I wanna do it.

20:13.644 --> 20:15.441
There you go. Okay?

20:19.850 --> 20:21.613
No, that's obvious.

20:25.356 --> 20:26.789
That's two.

20:35.433 --> 20:37.628
Well, that's a stupid trick.

20:38.135 --> 20:40.035
It's not a trick, man.

20:40.404 --> 20:42.531
Come on. Freak.

20:44.475 --> 20:45.703
Bye.

21:14.272 --> 21:15.705
Show's over!

21:20.711 --> 21:23.271
I said show's over!

21:28.219 --> 21:30.744
The show's never over for us, Bradley.

21:33.257 --> 21:35.953
- Victor.
- Aren't you gonna invite me in?

21:38.462 --> 21:40.589
Yeah. Come on in.

21:53.377 --> 21:58.178
You know, I've never said anything
to anyone about what happened.

21:58.916 --> 22:01.441
I'm living a totally
different life now, Victor.

22:01.519 --> 22:03.783
No need to bring up the past.

22:18.969 --> 22:20.402
You know,

22:21.539 --> 22:25.839
I always thought it would
be Wade to come knocking at my door.

22:25.910 --> 22:29.471
Well... Well,

22:30.548 --> 22:31.981
Wade's gone.

22:35.486 --> 22:37.613
I'm not afraid of you, Victor.

22:40.358 --> 22:42.349
I'm not afraid of dying.

22:43.594 --> 22:45.255
How do you know?

22:46.497 --> 22:48.727
You've never tried it before.

23:05.916 --> 23:07.816
Was it the wars?

23:09.286 --> 23:10.719
Which one?

23:11.255 --> 23:12.688
All of them.

23:20.598 --> 23:23.431
- Tell me.
- Hey.

23:24.268 --> 23:26.099
It's just a scratch.

23:33.444 --> 23:36.436
Looks like we're gonna need
new sheets again, baby.

23:36.514 --> 23:37.947
Yeah.

24:02.706 --> 24:04.640
Who the hell is this?

24:04.708 --> 24:06.676
Smells like government.

24:10.881 --> 24:13.315
My God. Haven't aged a day!

24:13.384 --> 24:14.908
Clean living.

24:15.453 --> 24:19.981
- You remember Agent Zero?
- Still shooting first, asking questions later?

24:21.559 --> 24:25.723
- You still chewing on cheap cigars?
- Boys, please.

24:27.198 --> 24:29.496
- I have a job for you.
- I already have a job.

24:29.567 --> 24:31.694
Lumberjack? 18 grand a year?

24:31.769 --> 24:35.205
18.5. Plus I haven't had to kill anyone
in a while.

24:35.272 --> 24:37.263
- Starting to miss it?
- Right about now I am.

24:37.341 --> 24:39.639
- Yeah?
- Zero, back to the car.

24:43.214 --> 24:44.681
Attaboy.

24:51.255 --> 24:54.588
You know, I'm not proud about
the way things ended between us.

24:54.658 --> 24:56.558
Conversation's over.

24:57.528 --> 25:01.157
Playing Little House on the Prairie
with a schoolteacher,

25:01.599 --> 25:03.362
I mean, that just isn't you, Logan.

25:03.534 --> 25:05.559
And you would know, huh?

25:05.936 --> 25:08.530
- I would.
- What do you want, Stryker?

25:10.674 --> 25:13.108
Bradley was killed three days ago.

25:14.144 --> 25:15.805
Wade before that.

25:16.547 --> 25:19.880
I believe that someone is hunting down
our old team.

25:20.818 --> 25:24.845
- Anyone else?
- As far as I know, Victor is safe.

25:26.657 --> 25:29.421
But whoever it is has names, addresses.

25:29.493 --> 25:31.552
I can take care of myself.

25:33.497 --> 25:35.761
This is not about you, Logan.

25:39.236 --> 25:41.170
Your country needs you.

25:42.206 --> 25:43.696
I'm Canadian.

25:44.708 --> 25:47.506
I know you, Logan! I know who you are!

26:01.058 --> 26:05.017
- Miss Kayla, Miss Kayla, look what I did.
- What did you do?

26:16.373 --> 26:18.534
Bye, Miss Silverfox! Bye!

26:25.449 --> 26:26.939
What's wrong?

26:29.320 --> 26:31.254
Stryker came by today.

26:32.356 --> 26:33.823
Don't worry. I said no.

26:33.891 --> 26:36.917
Why is he bothering you
after all these years?

26:36.994 --> 26:39.326
Because I'm the best there is at what I do,

26:39.396 --> 26:41.057
but what I do best isn't very nice.

26:41.131 --> 26:44.828
You're not an animal, Logan.
What you have is a gift.

26:44.902 --> 26:47.769
A gift. You can return a gift.

27:01.051 --> 27:02.643
Come on, fellas.

27:03.854 --> 27:05.287
All right.

27:05.789 --> 27:07.416
Stay in the car.

27:07.992 --> 27:10.119
I'm just gonna ask nicely.

27:14.131 --> 27:16.156
You mind letting us go by?

27:16.867 --> 27:18.494
- You in some kind of a hurry there, pal?
- Hey, hey, hey.

27:18.569 --> 27:19.866
Are you?

27:19.937 --> 27:21.199
Just move your truck so we can go by.

27:21.271 --> 27:23.432
We're trying to have
a conversation there, all right?

27:23.507 --> 27:25.702
You start something,
you'd better be ready to finish it.

27:25.776 --> 27:27.141
Listen...

27:27.211 --> 27:30.180
Hey, guys, take it easy! Calm down.

27:34.718 --> 27:37.710
- Your boyfriend's got a big mouth.
- I know.

27:37.788 --> 27:41.724
Big temper, too. So please let us pass.

27:46.363 --> 27:49.890
- Thank you.
- Come on, man, let's go.

27:50.668 --> 27:52.499
How'd you do that?

27:52.936 --> 27:55.564
Female powers of persuasion. It's a gift.

27:55.639 --> 27:59.040
Oh, I see.
Do you have those powers over me?

27:59.109 --> 28:01.976
Well, you didn't stay in the car, did you?

28:18.862 --> 28:21.194
Why is the moon so lonely?

28:22.566 --> 28:23.692
Why?

28:24.201 --> 28:26.499
Because she used to have a lover.

28:26.570 --> 28:28.970
- You tell this to the kids?
- No.

28:30.074 --> 28:32.975
His name was Kuekuatsheu
and they lived in the Spirit World together.

28:33.043 --> 28:36.035
Oh, this is a true story? All right.

28:36.113 --> 28:38.843
And every night they would
wander the skies together,

28:40.484 --> 28:44.079
but one of the other spirits was jealous.

28:45.389 --> 28:48.119
Trickster wanted the moon for himself,

28:48.659 --> 28:52.390
so he told Kuekuatsheu
that the moon had asked for flowers.

28:52.963 --> 28:56.797
He told him to come to our world
and pick her some wild roses,

28:57.067 --> 29:01.094
but Kuekuatsheu didn't know
that once you leave the Spirit World,

29:01.839 --> 29:03.773
you can never go back.

29:04.775 --> 29:10.645
And every night he looks up in the sky
and sees the moon and howls her name.

29:13.917 --> 29:15.145
But

29:17.554 --> 29:19.784
he can never touch her again.

29:20.591 --> 29:21.683
Wow.

29:22.526 --> 29:24.756
Koo-koo-ka-choo got screwed.

29:26.630 --> 29:28.222
"Kuekuatsheu."

29:34.805 --> 29:36.864
It means "the Wolverine".

30:38.035 --> 30:39.127
What you doing, Logan?

30:47.411 --> 30:48.571
Kayla.

31:32.723 --> 31:34.054
Oh, God.

31:35.125 --> 31:36.387
Kayla!

32:40.524 --> 32:43.288
You're not from around here, are you?

32:48.098 --> 32:49.998
What gave me away?

32:51.935 --> 32:53.368
Victor!

32:54.304 --> 32:58.673
- You got insurance on this place?
- Insurance? No.

33:00.043 --> 33:02.739
- Too bad.
- Victor!

33:16.393 --> 33:20.159
Well, well, well.
Look what the cat dragged in.

33:20.630 --> 33:23.463
Guys, whatever this is, take it outside.

33:34.811 --> 33:36.005
Why?

33:37.147 --> 33:38.512
Why?

33:42.853 --> 33:46.050
You don't call. You don't write.

33:48.091 --> 33:51.083
How else am I supposed
to get your attention?

34:29.232 --> 34:33.362
I hate to say it, Jimmy, but, frankly,
I'm a little disappointed.

34:35.739 --> 34:37.228
Stay down.

35:14.911 --> 35:17.744
Tell me something, Jimmy.
Was she worth it?

35:38.268 --> 35:40.736
When are you gonna figure it out?

35:41.605 --> 35:43.436
We're not like them.

35:45.308 --> 35:47.538
I am nothing like you.

35:49.412 --> 35:50.936
Sure, you are.

35:52.215 --> 35:54.274
You just don't know it yet.

36:08.365 --> 36:11.664
- What do we got?
- Bar fight. Multiple knife wounds.

36:13.803 --> 36:15.896
What is this, a joke? Guy's fine.

36:15.972 --> 36:17.200
- Where is he?
- Hey, hey, don't...

36:17.274 --> 36:19.242
- I said, where is he?
- I don't know who he is.

36:19.309 --> 36:21.106
I can help you.

36:27.651 --> 36:29.619
Six years I've been here.

36:29.686 --> 36:33.452
No one knew me, and then you show up,
and the next day she's dead!

36:33.523 --> 36:34.854
I tried to warn you.

36:34.925 --> 36:36.916
Why didn't you tell me it was Victor?

36:36.993 --> 36:39.223
- I didn't know!
- Bullshit!

36:39.930 --> 36:45.266
- Why?
- I swear on my son's life, I didn't!

36:52.676 --> 36:54.906
Victor's appetites were
becoming too public.

36:54.978 --> 36:57.970
I had to lock him up.
He felt I betrayed him.

36:58.748 --> 37:02.047
Went AWOL.
He said he was coming after all of us.

37:02.953 --> 37:04.716
You didn't come to warn me,

37:04.788 --> 37:07.086
you came to save your own ass.

37:07.624 --> 37:09.353
So what's your plan, Captain?

37:09.426 --> 37:11.553
You can't beat him, Logan,
you know you can't!

37:11.628 --> 37:14.028
I'm gonna find him and kill him.

37:15.098 --> 37:17.862
I can give you the tools to defeat him.

37:21.671 --> 37:23.571
And we can still save the others.

37:23.640 --> 37:25.938
You mean save yourself, right?

37:27.844 --> 37:29.812
I promise you two things.

37:29.879 --> 37:33.110
You will suffer more pain
than any other man can endure,

37:33.183 --> 37:35.549
but you will have your revenge.

37:37.988 --> 37:41.253
I come with you, I'm coming for blood.

37:42.959 --> 37:45.655
No law. No code of conduct.

37:46.363 --> 37:50.299
You point me in the right direction,
you get the hell out of my way.

38:30.273 --> 38:34.175
When it starts, whatever the reason is
that you're doing this,

38:34.911 --> 38:37.971
focus on that. Maybe it will help.

38:38.048 --> 38:40.608
Trust me, I've been through worse.

38:40.684 --> 38:42.447
No, you haven't.

38:43.420 --> 38:44.910
We're ready.

38:46.790 --> 38:51.557
We're gonna make you indestructible,
but first we're gonna have to destroy you.

38:54.664 --> 38:57.758
You remember
what we were looking for in Africa?

38:57.834 --> 39:00.325
- I remember.
- Well, I found it.

39:02.672 --> 39:06.438
It helped us create
a metal compound so strong

39:06.509 --> 39:09.171
that you will be able to withstand
virtually anything.

39:09.245 --> 39:11.304
It's called Adamantium.

39:13.149 --> 39:15.811
I can't put Victor down myself, Logan.

39:16.953 --> 39:20.980
To kill him, you're gonna have to embrace
the other side.

39:23.693 --> 39:25.422
Become the animal.

39:27.597 --> 39:29.189
Let's do this.

39:29.632 --> 39:31.293
I almost forgot.

39:34.771 --> 39:36.432
I want new ones.

39:36.906 --> 39:39.170
What do you want them to say?

39:40.643 --> 39:41.667
Wolverine.

39:59.429 --> 40:01.329
Generals, welcome.

40:02.799 --> 40:04.494
General Munson.

40:05.368 --> 40:08.428
Today we're gonna witness
medical history.

40:08.505 --> 40:11.599
- Today we're gonna create Weapon X.
- X?

40:12.575 --> 40:14.270
Roman numeral 10.

40:16.613 --> 40:20.913
We are about to begin bonding
Adamantium to Weapon X's skeleton.

40:22.085 --> 40:23.552
Let's begin.

41:10.333 --> 41:12.301
- We're brothers, Jimmy.
- Logan!

41:12.368 --> 41:14.893
Body temperature, 108 and rising.

41:17.841 --> 41:20.309
Why is he thrashing like that?
Why isn't he sedated?

41:20.376 --> 41:23.834
He feels pain just like the rest of us,
but anesthesia won't work on him.

41:23.913 --> 41:27.679
- That's why he had to volunteer.
- Heart rate, 190. 195.

41:27.750 --> 41:30.275
- Will he survive this?
- I don't know.

41:30.353 --> 41:31.820
200.

41:34.257 --> 41:35.383
Son.

41:36.626 --> 41:38.287
Heart rate well beyond maximum.

41:38.361 --> 41:41.330
- Blood pressure?
- 260 over 180 and rising.

41:41.397 --> 41:43.729
He can make it. He can make it.

41:48.104 --> 41:49.332
Victor!

41:54.978 --> 41:56.206
I love you.

41:56.279 --> 41:57.906
You're not an animal.

42:04.454 --> 42:06.183
It means "the Wolverine".

42:33.016 --> 42:35.109
Well, I guess he can die.

43:06.115 --> 43:08.606
Come on, old friend. Come back.

43:12.121 --> 43:13.816
Heart rate rising.

43:15.224 --> 43:17.715
Adamantium reservoir is depleted.

43:17.794 --> 43:20.592
No rejection. Procedure completed.

43:20.964 --> 43:23.228
- We did it.
- We did it.

43:27.971 --> 43:29.495
Yeah! Yes.

43:30.106 --> 43:32.597
Are we taking him to the island?

43:32.675 --> 43:34.472
The island? No.

43:36.179 --> 43:38.079
The bonding works.

43:38.147 --> 43:40.411
We'll use his DNA for the XI.

43:43.219 --> 43:44.982
Erase his memory.

43:48.491 --> 43:50.220
Erase his memory.

43:59.769 --> 44:01.669
I think he heard you.

44:16.986 --> 44:18.510
Lock down!

44:55.692 --> 44:58.456
Hunt him down. Take his head off.

45:40.169 --> 45:41.568
Travis.

45:49.345 --> 45:54.908
- I think there's a naked man in the barn.
- Yep.

46:26.616 --> 46:27.844
Son?

46:29.085 --> 46:31.053
What in hell you doing?

46:32.155 --> 46:34.020
- It's cold.
- Cold.

46:39.128 --> 46:41.688
- You got no clothes on.
- Yeah.

46:42.999 --> 46:45.763
- You're not on the drugs, are you?
- No.

46:47.170 --> 46:50.799
- No, just had a rough night.
- Yeah, you could say that.

46:54.043 --> 46:56.034
Come on up to the house.

46:56.112 --> 46:59.604
Some of my son's old clothes
will probably fit you.

46:59.682 --> 47:02.150
Here. Cover it up with that, huh?

47:02.785 --> 47:06.118
I don't want you giving
the old lady a heart attack.

47:51.901 --> 47:55.029
- You all right in there?
- Yeah, yeah, I'm fine!

47:56.205 --> 47:58.105
Supper's on the table.

47:58.674 --> 48:00.335
Yeah, I'll be there in a minute.

48:11.821 --> 48:14.085
I swear, I'm gonna pay for it.

48:15.491 --> 48:19.154
- Set it down over there.
- Right.

48:22.765 --> 48:24.733
Come and sit down, son.

48:30.273 --> 48:33.367
I can't thank you both enough
for everything.

48:33.442 --> 48:36.605
It wouldn't have been decent
to leave you out there to freeze.

48:36.679 --> 48:38.579
- "Decent."
- What?

48:40.549 --> 48:43.677
Nothing. I'm just not
really used to that word.

48:46.422 --> 48:48.287
That's a nice chopper you've got out there.

48:48.357 --> 48:50.723
- You know motorcycles?
- Oh! Lord, here we go.

48:50.793 --> 48:54.456
My favorite's a '48 Panhead.
Bought one new off the line.

48:54.530 --> 48:56.623
I think you're a little young for that, son.

48:56.699 --> 48:59.759
You must be exhausted.
You get a good night's sleep.

48:59.835 --> 49:01.302
In the barn.

49:02.505 --> 49:04.871
Nothing you can break out there.

49:20.690 --> 49:22.624
Why is the moon so lonely?

49:22.692 --> 49:24.125
Why?

49:24.593 --> 49:27.061
Because she used to have a lover.

49:29.098 --> 49:31.328
He can never touch her again.

49:51.821 --> 49:53.413
You sleep okay?

49:55.658 --> 49:56.920
Yeah.

49:58.394 --> 50:01.557
You look like a man
fixing to do a bad thing.

50:04.066 --> 50:07.524
You know what happens
to men who go looking for blood?

50:08.104 --> 50:10.800
- What?
- They find it.

50:14.477 --> 50:16.604
We all got a choice, son.

50:16.679 --> 50:20.080
- Yeah, well, mine got taken.
- Bullshit.

50:24.086 --> 50:26.111
This was my son's jacket.

50:28.424 --> 50:29.823
Try it on.

50:45.541 --> 50:49.170
- Thank you.
- Yep.

50:50.246 --> 50:54.615
You want to take my bike for a spin?
Test the suspension?

50:55.951 --> 50:57.384
'64, huh?

51:00.222 --> 51:01.849
Man, you're heavy.

51:01.924 --> 51:04.188
Yeah, I put on a little weight recently.

51:04.260 --> 51:06.421
- Good morning!
- Good morning.

51:08.064 --> 51:11.465
Oh. It fits you beautifully.

51:13.702 --> 51:15.226
I brought you some...

51:24.780 --> 51:27.681
Weapon X is in the barn.
He's just murdered two civilians.

51:27.750 --> 51:31.151
Blow him to bits.
Let's see if he can survive that.

51:54.810 --> 51:56.243
Come get me.

52:08.524 --> 52:10.458
Blow his brains all over the road!

52:10.526 --> 52:11.857
Damn it!

52:48.197 --> 52:50.358
Alpha one, do not lose him!

52:58.274 --> 53:00.742
Alpha two! Target coming to you!

53:51.594 --> 53:52.959
Pull up!

54:23.959 --> 54:26.086
Pull back! Pull back!

54:44.747 --> 54:46.180
Zero?

54:49.018 --> 54:50.645
Zero, come in.

54:53.889 --> 54:55.322
Zero?

55:01.297 --> 55:03.822
- Zero, is Logan dead?
- I don't know.

55:04.233 --> 55:05.666
I'm down.

55:07.836 --> 55:10.168
Zero, is he dead? Is Logan dead?

55:14.610 --> 55:16.271
Zero, come in.

55:20.716 --> 55:22.684
You tried to kill me.

55:23.118 --> 55:25.052
- Logan?
- Where's Victor?

55:25.120 --> 55:26.849
Come back to base.

55:27.356 --> 55:29.187
I'll explain everything.
We'll take Victor down together.

55:29.258 --> 55:33.024
Wrong answer.
After I kill Victor, I'm coming for you.

55:36.231 --> 55:37.892
Logan, listen to me.

55:38.467 --> 55:41.868
If you go down this road,
you're not gonna like what you find.

55:41.937 --> 55:45.964
You wanted the animal, Colonel.
You got it.

55:51.013 --> 55:54.972
Those were good people back there.
Innocent people.

56:05.194 --> 56:09.028
It's funny how good, innocent people tend
to die around you.

56:29.885 --> 56:31.944
Zero never stood a chance.

56:32.321 --> 56:36.155
The only thing that'll take him down
is an Adamantium bullet.

56:43.632 --> 56:46.601
This facility's compromised.
Prep transport.

56:55.544 --> 56:57.671
Colonel, this is turning into a disaster.

56:57.746 --> 57:00.340
- Don't worry. We'll stop him.
- Really?

57:00.416 --> 57:04.409
You just spent half a billion dollars
making him indestructible.

57:06.622 --> 57:07.748
- Sir?
- Yes?

57:07.823 --> 57:11.623
The young mutant you've been looking for.
We've found him.

57:11.693 --> 57:14.093
General, Logan isn't
the only piece of this puzzle.

57:14.163 --> 57:16.358
I need to evacuate this facility.

57:16.432 --> 57:19.924
Please go back to Washington.
We've got work to do.

57:22.871 --> 57:25.669
Yo hablo, I talk. Tû hablas, you talk.

57:25.741 --> 57:28.175
ÊI habla... Somebody translate.

57:29.378 --> 57:30.606
Summers!

57:31.079 --> 57:33.513
Sit up and take off those glasses.

57:34.917 --> 57:36.578
I have a headache.

57:37.319 --> 57:39.651
Then you can wear them
in detention after school

57:39.721 --> 57:42.815
while you write out this conjugation
100 times.

57:42.891 --> 57:44.825
- Somebody else?
- He talks.

57:44.893 --> 57:46.918
Thank you. He talks. ÊI habla.

57:58.507 --> 58:00.771
- You sure it was Victor?
- Yeah.

58:02.411 --> 58:04.845
Damn. I'm sorry, man.

58:08.650 --> 58:10.743
What the hell happened to him after I left?

58:10.819 --> 58:14.084
He got worse.
He felt like you abandoned him.

58:14.156 --> 58:15.851
Hell, we all did.

58:16.325 --> 58:19.761
But Victor, he had to prove
he was better than you.

58:19.828 --> 58:22.991
Hunting and killing
everything he was pointed at.

58:23.065 --> 58:25.329
Quit a few months later myself.

58:25.400 --> 58:27.732
Couldn't take rounding them up.

58:28.103 --> 58:30.537
- Rounding who up?
- Leave it alone.

58:31.039 --> 58:32.973
Rounding who up, John?

58:33.575 --> 58:35.406
Hey! Damn it, John!

58:35.477 --> 58:37.741
We hunted our own kind, Logan.

58:38.347 --> 58:40.781
There's a special place in hell
for the things we did.

58:40.849 --> 58:43.841
Mutants? Why?

58:44.820 --> 58:47.653
Stryker said we'd be making a difference,

58:47.723 --> 58:50.317
protecting people from the bad ones.

58:58.333 --> 59:01.234
How are you gonna take
Victor down, Logan?

59:01.303 --> 59:05.763
- Remember that stuff in Africa?
- Yeah, I remember Africa. What about it?

59:09.211 --> 59:10.371
Damn.

59:11.880 --> 59:14.007
What'd they do to you, man?

59:14.316 --> 59:15.749
Don't ask.

59:17.986 --> 59:19.681
Listen, Zero said something
about an island.

59:19.755 --> 59:21.313
Does that mean anything to you?

59:21.390 --> 59:23.654
Nope. But maybe Dukes knows.

59:24.126 --> 59:26.720
- Him and Zero were real tight.
- Fred Dukes? Where is he?

59:26.795 --> 59:28.262
- He's here.
- Well, let's go talk to him.

59:28.330 --> 59:31.390
Hold on. He don't get in till around 4:00.

59:31.466 --> 59:34.799
But I got to warn you, he developed
a bit of an eating disorder.

59:34.870 --> 59:39.170
We all got our coping mechanisms.
I'm trying to whup him back into shape.

59:39.241 --> 59:41.641
Whatever you do,
don't mention his weight.

59:42.678 --> 59:45.442
Come on, Fred, if you wanna get
in shape, you got to move, man.

59:45.514 --> 59:48.483
I told him he got to move.
He's got to move! What?

59:51.620 --> 59:54.248
Fred Dukes? That looks like
the creature that ate Fred Dukes.

59:54.323 --> 59:56.188
Hey, be nice, man.

59:57.926 --> 59:59.894
Hey, fat... Fred.

01:00:00.696 --> 01:00:04.598
I seem to remember that girl
when she was about 85 pounds, huh?

01:00:05.801 --> 01:00:08.565
Oh, that's funny.
You're still so funny, Logan.

01:00:08.637 --> 01:00:10.730
You know where Victor is?

01:00:11.607 --> 01:00:14.132
- No idea.
- What's the island, slim?

01:00:16.778 --> 01:00:18.678
Don't let the door hit you
on the way out, Logan.

01:00:18.747 --> 01:00:21.079
Listen, I ain't leaving here
till you tell me where Victor is.

01:00:21.149 --> 01:00:24.050
So come on, bub, for old times' sake, huh?

01:00:25.420 --> 01:00:28.981
Did you just call me Blob?

01:00:30.826 --> 01:00:32.259
No, but...

01:00:38.266 --> 01:00:40.894
I told you not to mention his weight.
Why'd you call him Blob?

01:00:40.969 --> 01:00:43.403
I didn't call him Blob. I said "bub".

01:00:43.472 --> 01:00:45.702
- God damn it.
- Hey, hey, hey. Hey, Logan.

01:00:45.774 --> 01:00:47.036
I got an idea.

01:00:48.644 --> 01:00:51.135
- This is your idea of an idea?
- I'm trying to help you out, Logan.

01:00:51.213 --> 01:00:52.805
Dukes don't like you that much
and you know it.

01:00:52.881 --> 01:00:55.145
- Yeah, the feeling's mutual.
- Well, use them gloves, man.

01:00:55.217 --> 01:00:59.483
Dance with him a little bit.
Allow him to let his anger out on you.

01:00:59.554 --> 01:01:02.580
Figure if you do that, he'll probably
tell you everything you want to know.

01:01:02.658 --> 01:01:04.455
Come on, man, look at him.

01:01:04.526 --> 01:01:07.256
Got a big old ass coming out
the front of his shirt.

01:01:07.329 --> 01:01:09.729
Jesus. He's gonna have a coronary,
for Christ's sake.

01:01:09.798 --> 01:01:12.665
Is there even a stretcher big enough
to take this guy out of here?

01:01:14.469 --> 01:01:16.767
It ain't him I'm worried about
getting out of here on a stretcher.

01:01:16.838 --> 01:01:19.329
- You're an asshole.
- Come on, Logan.

01:01:21.543 --> 01:01:23.534
- Whup his ass!
- You want it?

01:01:23.612 --> 01:01:25.546
Dance with him, Fred!
Just like I taught you.

01:01:26.214 --> 01:01:27.238
You want to dance with me?

01:01:27.315 --> 01:01:30.113
- Come on, Fred!
- Oh! Oh, that feels good.

01:01:33.355 --> 01:01:35.016
Hey! Guess what?

01:01:36.525 --> 01:01:37.822
See, he gonna talk now.

01:01:37.893 --> 01:01:40.293
- You got him right where you want him.
- Whose side are you on, anyway?

01:01:40.362 --> 01:01:41.829
Come on!

01:01:42.464 --> 01:01:44.432
Come on, now, lamb chop!

01:02:00.015 --> 01:02:01.209
Damn!

01:02:15.831 --> 01:02:17.355
Now, where's Victor?

01:02:48.830 --> 01:02:51.822
Little dark for sunglasses, don't you think?

01:03:07.415 --> 01:03:11.749
- Please, don't! Please, don't!
- Victor!

01:03:15.357 --> 01:03:17.723
Hey, hey! Where's Victor?

01:03:19.261 --> 01:03:24.631
Yeah. Victor's with Stryker on the island.

01:03:24.699 --> 01:03:27.167
They run it together.

01:03:28.370 --> 01:03:31.339
What? They what?
Victor will be with Stryker?

01:03:32.240 --> 01:03:33.400
Yeah.

01:03:34.142 --> 01:03:36.133
You didn't know that?

01:03:56.131 --> 01:04:00.568
All that's left now is Logan.
I trust you can handle that.

01:04:01.870 --> 01:04:05.670
- I did before, didn't I?
- Oh, yes. You did that.

01:04:09.010 --> 01:04:12.309
Our deal. It still applies, right?

01:04:14.649 --> 01:04:17.777
Of course.
Now bag him and tag him, Captain.

01:04:26.761 --> 01:04:28.524
What's the island?

01:04:29.731 --> 01:04:33.428
It's where Stryker takes
them after Victor's caught them.

01:04:34.469 --> 01:04:36.767
Wait, hang on a minute. Takes who?

01:04:38.473 --> 01:04:39.804
Mutants.

01:04:40.609 --> 01:04:44.739
Rumor is that Stryker's doing
experiments on them there.

01:04:47.716 --> 01:04:50.014
I mean, you never wondered
what happened to them?

01:04:50.085 --> 01:04:51.848
I tried not to.

01:05:08.203 --> 01:05:11.639
They killed her so I'd let them
put Adamantium in me.

01:05:14.943 --> 01:05:17.776
They killed her for a goddamn experiment.

01:05:21.883 --> 01:05:26.149
- Where is it? Where is it?
- Logan, Stryker kept it real secret.

01:05:30.692 --> 01:05:34.719
But a prisoner escaped there once.

01:05:34.796 --> 01:05:37.264
- Who?
- His name was Remy LeBeau.

01:05:37.332 --> 01:05:39.596
He was a street hustler from New Orleans.

01:05:39.668 --> 01:05:42.535
The guards at the prison
called him Gambit

01:05:42.604 --> 01:05:43.969
because he kept taking
all their money at poker.

01:05:44.039 --> 01:05:46.007
- That's all I know.
- What's Stryker up to, Fred?

01:05:46.074 --> 01:05:47.837
What's the endgame?

01:05:49.844 --> 01:05:54.338
He's taking their powers.
Trying to combine them somehow.

01:05:54.416 --> 01:05:57.283
That's all I know, Logan. That's all I know.

01:05:57.919 --> 01:06:01.582
If I have to come back here,
I'm gonna take your head off.

01:06:05.360 --> 01:06:07.521
I'm coming with you, Logan.

01:06:08.964 --> 01:06:11.728
- There's no redemption where I'm going.
- I ain't asking.

01:06:49.437 --> 01:06:51.166
There's our dude.

01:06:57.445 --> 01:06:59.174
That's cool.

01:06:59.247 --> 01:07:01.306
I'm gonna go cover the back
in case he rabbits.

01:07:01.383 --> 01:07:03.510
- I'm not gonna fight with him.
- Yeah, right.

01:07:03.585 --> 01:07:05.644
What? I get in fights with everybody?

01:07:05.720 --> 01:07:07.847
Don't dogs kill cats?

01:07:07.922 --> 01:07:10.390
Just go cover the back, will you?

01:07:14.396 --> 01:07:16.887
- Give me 500.
- I'm in.

01:07:22.804 --> 01:07:24.567
Are you Remy LeBeau?

01:07:26.741 --> 01:07:28.971
- Do I owe you money?
- No.

01:07:30.612 --> 01:07:32.512
Then Remy LeBeau I am.

01:07:51.132 --> 01:07:53.965
Large blind's 100. Small blind's 50.

01:07:54.903 --> 01:07:58.930
- May I deal you in?
- What can I get for 17 bucks?

01:08:00.008 --> 01:08:01.305
$17?

01:08:02.911 --> 01:08:04.936
A cab ride home, perhaps?

01:08:09.484 --> 01:08:12.180
You my brother's new babysitter, John?

01:08:13.021 --> 01:08:14.386
I ain't Bradley, Victor.

01:08:14.456 --> 01:08:16.549
And your creepy black coat
don't scare me.

01:08:16.624 --> 01:08:17.852
Really?

01:08:18.660 --> 01:08:20.560
Worked on Dukes.

01:08:20.627 --> 01:08:22.858
You shouldn't have done that,
'cause now I'm gonna kill you

01:08:22.930 --> 01:08:25.058
before Logan even gets a chance.

01:08:25.366 --> 01:08:27.926
So what brings you to our fair city, sir?

01:08:28.002 --> 01:08:29.560
Victor Creed.

01:08:32.040 --> 01:08:33.734
And who's that?

01:08:34.442 --> 01:08:35.568
The man I'm gonna kill.

01:08:37.345 --> 01:08:40.678
He works with a man named Stryker
on an island.

01:08:42.183 --> 01:08:45.675
- Just need to know where it is.
- And why would you think I know that?

01:08:45.752 --> 01:08:48.620
Well, 'cause I know who you are, Gambit.

01:08:49.724 --> 01:08:54.423
You're the guy who escaped and you're
the guy who's gonna take me back there.

01:08:55.497 --> 01:08:59.160
You know, John, there's something
I always wanted to tell you.

01:09:05.240 --> 01:09:08.265
You're predictable.

01:09:11.078 --> 01:09:13.569
I can feel your spine, Johnny Boy.

01:09:14.549 --> 01:09:17.279
That's funny. Never knew you had one.

01:09:20.889 --> 01:09:24.221
Those are mighty nice tags
you have on there, sir.

01:09:25.593 --> 01:09:28.687
The men who took me wore
tags just like them.

01:09:32.367 --> 01:09:34.733
Hey, now, bub, you listen to me.

01:09:52.353 --> 01:09:54.252
Damn it. That little...

01:10:08.069 --> 01:10:11.800
Two years I rotted in that hellhole
and I ain't never going back.

01:10:16.077 --> 01:10:17.408
Shiny.

01:10:20.081 --> 01:10:22.208
Tell me something, Jimmy.

01:10:22.884 --> 01:10:25.284
Do you even know how to kill me?

01:10:25.353 --> 01:10:28.083
I'm gonna cut your goddamned head off.

01:10:28.756 --> 01:10:30.621
See if that works.

01:10:40.235 --> 01:10:42.567
You're getting slow, old man.

01:10:51.279 --> 01:10:53.247
You son of a bitch.

01:10:56.884 --> 01:10:59.751
You're gonna die for what you did to her.

01:11:23.978 --> 01:11:25.240
Victor!

01:11:35.189 --> 01:11:37.282
Well, that's a nice stick.

01:12:35.750 --> 01:12:38.275
Okay, shithead, here's the deal.

01:12:38.353 --> 01:12:41.720
See, you're gonna take me to this island,
where I can kill Creed, Stryker

01:12:41.789 --> 01:12:45.987
and pretty much everyone you hate
in this world. Do you understand?

01:12:46.661 --> 01:12:48.322
You're really gonna kill them?

01:12:48.396 --> 01:12:51.194
As long as you stay out of my way, yeah.

01:13:05.246 --> 01:13:06.713
Colonel?

01:13:07.281 --> 01:13:09.511
- General?
- Is this Weapon XI?

01:13:12.086 --> 01:13:14.987
All their strengths
and none of their weaknesses.

01:13:15.056 --> 01:13:16.990
You really hate them, don't you?

01:13:17.058 --> 01:13:18.958
No, I don't hate them.

01:13:19.360 --> 01:13:23.626
After 20 years of working with mutants,
I just know what they can do.

01:13:27.535 --> 01:13:31.596
We can win this war before it starts
and save countless lives in the process.

01:13:31.672 --> 01:13:35.233
Pre-emptive action is
the only action here, General.

01:13:35.309 --> 01:13:39.040
The days of our country
sitting on the sidelines are over.

01:13:40.014 --> 01:13:44.075
We need to take the fight to the enemy
before they take the fight to us.

01:13:44.152 --> 01:13:46.985
- I admire your passion, I do.
- Thank you.

01:13:47.755 --> 01:13:50.053
But this is as far as it goes.

01:13:51.058 --> 01:13:54.619
- Weapon X was a hiccup.
- We know about your son, Bill.

01:13:55.263 --> 01:13:58.824
We know he's a mutant,
and we know he killed your wife.

01:13:58.900 --> 01:14:01.960
- You shouldn't have kept that from us.
- That...

01:14:03.504 --> 01:14:05.233
That has nothing
to do with my work, General.

01:14:05.306 --> 01:14:06.637
Bullshit.

01:14:06.941 --> 01:14:10.240
You're too close to this.
I'm shutting you down.

01:14:10.978 --> 01:14:15.415
Okay. You're right. I won't lie to you.

01:14:18.886 --> 01:14:22.549
My son did bring
the problem home for me,

01:14:24.058 --> 01:14:25.821
but I took an oath

01:14:27.328 --> 01:14:29.592
to protect the American people

01:14:30.698 --> 01:14:33.667
from every threat, both foreign

01:14:41.776 --> 01:14:43.437
and domestic.

01:14:51.385 --> 01:14:53.216
- You don't like flying, huh?
- I'm fine.

01:14:53.287 --> 01:14:54.720
- Just concentrate on what you're doing.
- You sure?

01:14:54.789 --> 01:14:56.416
You got a bit of sweat
on your brow there.

01:14:56.491 --> 01:14:58.152
Very funny. Just keep your eyes on the...

01:14:58.226 --> 01:14:59.989
On the what? The clouds?
Keep my eyes on the clouds?

01:15:00.061 --> 01:15:01.653
You're up and down
like a freaking yo-yo here!

01:15:01.729 --> 01:15:04.129
- Where'd you get this thing, anyway?
- Oh, this is my baby.

01:15:04.198 --> 01:15:06.928
I won her in a game. Jacks over fives.

01:15:08.236 --> 01:15:09.498
Great.

01:15:10.071 --> 01:15:12.232
Relax. We're almost there.

01:15:15.610 --> 01:15:19.046
There it is. The island. Three Mile Island.

01:15:19.580 --> 01:15:21.548
Hiding in plain sight.

01:15:24.085 --> 01:15:27.077
No one's gonna snoop
around a nuclear reactor.

01:15:27.154 --> 01:15:29.145
They think it's gonna turn them
into freaks.

01:15:29.223 --> 01:15:31.282
- Like you?
- Right.

01:15:34.028 --> 01:15:36.758
All right. You ready?
Because it's now or never. Let's go.

01:15:36.831 --> 01:15:38.264
About time.

01:15:47.475 --> 01:15:51.036
Hey, if it makes you feel any better,
this is really gonna hurt.

01:15:51.112 --> 01:15:53.910
Well, yeah, it kind of does, actually.

01:15:55.116 --> 01:15:58.017
- Good luck.
- Likewise.

01:16:00.288 --> 01:16:01.482
Oh, shit.

01:16:08.930 --> 01:16:11.455
How you doing? Everything all right?

01:16:13.000 --> 01:16:15.525
- Is he ready yet?
- A few more hours.

01:16:15.603 --> 01:16:18.834
- And he will respond to my commands?
- Absolutely.

01:17:22.536 --> 01:17:23.764
Logan.

01:17:25.039 --> 01:17:27.132
Welcome back to the war.

01:17:28.142 --> 01:17:31.009
Before I gut you, I want to know why.

01:17:32.713 --> 01:17:35.045
I needed your powers for the Pool.

01:17:35.116 --> 01:17:37.584
- For the what?
- The mutant killer.

01:17:38.519 --> 01:17:40.111
Deadpool.

01:17:41.355 --> 01:17:43.323
Years of searching and refining,

01:17:43.391 --> 01:17:47.350
finding the right powers
that can coexist in one body

01:17:47.428 --> 01:17:49.589
without ripping it apart.

01:17:50.765 --> 01:17:53.529
My son was the first piece of the puzzle.

01:17:55.369 --> 01:17:57.530
Logan, you were the last.

01:17:57.605 --> 01:17:59.835
You made Weapon XI possible.

01:18:00.875 --> 01:18:06.108
I asked you to help,
but you said you wanted the quiet life.

01:18:08.215 --> 01:18:09.409
Well,

01:18:10.117 --> 01:18:14.986
I've learned that nothing motivates
the men in your family like revenge.

01:18:32.573 --> 01:18:34.006
Who are you?

01:18:34.875 --> 01:18:37.036
Oh, she's real, old friend.

01:18:48.956 --> 01:18:52.187
Did you really think
we'd just let you walk away?

01:18:52.460 --> 01:18:54.553
You're a dangerous man.

01:18:54.628 --> 01:18:57.392
We like to keep an eye on dangerous men.

01:18:58.132 --> 01:19:00.532
Tell him about the day you died.

01:19:06.407 --> 01:19:09.501
They gave me a shot
of hydrochlorothiazide.

01:19:11.579 --> 01:19:15.242
It reduces the heart rate so low
it appears you flatlined.

01:19:27.161 --> 01:19:29.186
Don't be angry with her.

01:19:30.197 --> 01:19:32.927
She's a real credit to your species.

01:19:36.237 --> 01:19:39.695
Did you know that her sister has
diamond-hard skin?

01:19:40.541 --> 01:19:43.203
Kayla's mutation is tactohypnosis.

01:19:43.844 --> 01:19:46.904
She can influence people
as long as she touches them.

01:19:46.981 --> 01:19:49.609
Quite a useful tool in a seduction.

01:19:49.683 --> 01:19:52.015
It was never real, my friend.

01:19:57.424 --> 01:19:59.324
It was real for me.

01:20:01.328 --> 01:20:05.788
I told you if you came down this road,
you wouldn't like what you found.

01:20:12.039 --> 01:20:16.840
That story you told me about a man
who gets flowers for the moon,

01:20:18.913 --> 01:20:20.744
I had it backwards.

01:20:23.951 --> 01:20:27.409
I thought you were the moon
and I was your wolverine.

01:20:29.723 --> 01:20:32.419
But you're the trickster, aren't you?

01:20:33.060 --> 01:20:35.494
I'm just the fool who got played.

01:20:37.531 --> 01:20:40.523
The worst part of it is,
I should have known.

01:20:43.637 --> 01:20:45.867
But I ignored my instincts.

01:20:49.510 --> 01:20:51.740
I ignored what I really am.

01:20:56.350 --> 01:20:58.841
But that won't ever happen again.

01:21:30.551 --> 01:21:32.485
- Colonel?
- Not now, Kayla.

01:21:32.553 --> 01:21:35.078
I've done everything you've asked.

01:21:36.557 --> 01:21:37.990
My sister.

01:21:38.959 --> 01:21:41.985
You said if I helped you, you'd let her go.

01:21:42.062 --> 01:21:46.692
Kayla, it's not as simple as that.
Her mutation is unique. Quite beautiful.

01:21:46.767 --> 01:21:48.997
We just need a little more time
to analyze it, that's all.

01:21:49.069 --> 01:21:50.696
You let him go?

01:21:54.174 --> 01:21:56.540
- Victor, please.
- You can't let him go.

01:21:56.610 --> 01:21:58.601
- You can't beat him, Victor.
- Then give me the Adamantium!

01:21:58.679 --> 01:22:00.078
- Your tests came back.
- We had a deal!

01:22:00.147 --> 01:22:02.809
You would never survive the operation.

01:22:04.985 --> 01:22:08.148
- I can take anything he can.
- No, you can't.

01:22:08.956 --> 01:22:12.915
You're my favorite soldier, Victor.
Be patient. Your time will come.

01:22:12.993 --> 01:22:14.620
He's using us.

01:22:23.203 --> 01:22:26.661
How about this time you die for real?

01:22:28.275 --> 01:22:29.708
Let me go.

01:22:32.313 --> 01:22:34.873
Your little mind games don't work on me.

01:22:34.949 --> 01:22:36.280
Victor!

01:23:10.617 --> 01:23:12.710
Feels good, doesn't it?

01:23:13.954 --> 01:23:15.649
All that rage.

01:23:17.391 --> 01:23:20.189
- Do it.
- Logan!

01:23:21.528 --> 01:23:25.191
- You're not an animal.
- Oh, yes, you are.

01:23:29.269 --> 01:23:30.702
Do it.

01:23:34.541 --> 01:23:36.008
Finish it.

01:24:00.534 --> 01:24:01.865
Logan?

01:24:05.205 --> 01:24:09.039
My sister. They have my sister.

01:24:09.543 --> 01:24:12.478
Please. I didn't trick you into loving me.

01:24:13.280 --> 01:24:15.407
It was real for me, too.

01:24:17.985 --> 01:24:21.443
Please, I'm so sorry. They have my sister.

01:24:23.023 --> 01:24:24.490
Where is she?

01:24:29.963 --> 01:24:32.488
- Activate Weapon XI!
- The bonding process isn't complete.

01:24:32.566 --> 01:24:34.193
Just do it! Now!

01:25:37.431 --> 01:25:39.160
Come on. Come on!

01:26:30.517 --> 01:26:31.643
Okay.

01:26:32.686 --> 01:26:33.983
Perfect.

01:26:34.054 --> 01:26:35.851
- Kayla, get these kids out of here.
- Logan...

01:26:35.923 --> 01:26:37.788
Find another way out.

01:26:38.292 --> 01:26:40.419
Okay. Let's go.

01:26:41.028 --> 01:26:42.859
Wade, is that you?

01:26:46.633 --> 01:26:50.034
Guess Stryker finally figured out
how to shut you up.

01:26:52.139 --> 01:26:53.401
Now...

01:27:00.647 --> 01:27:01.875
Wade?

01:27:02.950 --> 01:27:05.009
You don't have to do this.

01:27:05.886 --> 01:27:07.877
All right, maybe you do.

01:27:14.828 --> 01:27:16.762
You're shitting me.

01:27:22.002 --> 01:27:23.799
Shoot on sight!

01:27:31.678 --> 01:27:34.841
- I can help! Point me at them!
- Go.

01:27:42.789 --> 01:27:44.347
Go! Now!

01:27:50.664 --> 01:27:53.155
- Did I get them?
- Yeah.

01:28:03.343 --> 01:28:04.867
- Let's go.
- I can't go.

01:28:04.945 --> 01:28:07.573
- Kayla, come on!
- I have to stay here.

01:28:08.081 --> 01:28:09.708
You take them.

01:28:10.684 --> 01:28:12.879
Go! Go!

01:28:40.747 --> 01:28:42.180
Go left.

01:28:42.249 --> 01:28:43.443
Left.

01:28:44.284 --> 01:28:46.013
- What?
- We go left.

01:28:46.086 --> 01:28:48.179
- You can't see.
- Trust me.

01:29:02.803 --> 01:29:05.203
Let's see you dance up here.

01:29:41.742 --> 01:29:43.767
Nobody kills you but me.

01:29:52.552 --> 01:29:54.144
Back to back!

01:29:55.889 --> 01:29:58.357
- I got him!
- Oh, no, you don't.

01:31:33.687 --> 01:31:35.951
Stop! This can't be the way.

01:31:36.022 --> 01:31:37.512
- This is the way.
- How do you know?

01:31:37.591 --> 01:31:39.422
I just know. Come on.

01:31:50.837 --> 01:31:52.634
Adamantium bullets.

01:31:53.273 --> 01:31:56.436
Let's see him heal with
a few of these through his thick skull.

01:31:56.510 --> 01:31:59.070
You can't stop him, even with that.

01:31:59.446 --> 01:32:01.880
- He'll heal.
- His brain may heal,

01:32:03.950 --> 01:32:06.384
but his memories won't grow back.

01:32:22.969 --> 01:32:26.234
This doesn't change anything
between us, Victor.

01:32:27.507 --> 01:32:30.601
- We're done.
- We can never be done, Jimmy.

01:32:31.912 --> 01:32:35.541
We're brothers,
and brothers look out for each other.

01:33:09.549 --> 01:33:11.574
- You miss me?
- Ah, Jesus.

01:33:13.053 --> 01:33:15.453
You know, when you said
you were gonna kill everyone,

01:33:15.522 --> 01:33:18.013
I thought you may
just have been exaggerating.

01:33:18.091 --> 01:33:19.524
Yeah.

01:33:20.594 --> 01:33:22.721
Do I look like a man who exaggerates?

01:33:22.796 --> 01:33:24.787
- You're welcome.
- Logan?

01:33:27.267 --> 01:33:28.564
Logan.

01:33:32.505 --> 01:33:34.973
There's kids trying to get off the island.
Split up. Go!

01:33:35.041 --> 01:33:36.474
I'm on it.

01:33:44.417 --> 01:33:46.510
Kayla! Kayla!

01:33:50.590 --> 01:33:51.750
Hey.

01:33:56.763 --> 01:33:58.230
I love you.

01:34:10.610 --> 01:34:12.305
- Hey...
- I'm so cold.

01:34:12.379 --> 01:34:15.405
Listen to me.
I'm gonna get you out of here.

01:34:15.482 --> 01:34:16.972
Understand?

01:34:17.050 --> 01:34:20.315
Just go easy. Nice and easy. That's it.
That's it.

01:34:22.722 --> 01:34:25.247
Okay. I'm gonna get you help.

01:34:48.648 --> 01:34:50.081
Logan!

01:35:46.439 --> 01:35:48.999
I should make you pull the trigger.

01:35:49.743 --> 01:35:52.712
But that would make us
no better than you.

01:35:53.780 --> 01:35:55.611
Throw the gun away.

01:35:58.852 --> 01:36:00.285
Turn around.

01:36:00.887 --> 01:36:05.517
Walk until your feet bleed.
And then keep walking.

01:36:43.563 --> 01:36:45.394
It will be all right, Scott.

01:36:45.465 --> 01:36:48.229
My name is Charles Xavier.

01:36:48.301 --> 01:36:50.326
I'm a mutant like you.

01:36:50.403 --> 01:36:54.601
- I can hear your thoughts.
- Yes, and I can hear yours.

01:36:55.441 --> 01:36:59.343
You're safe now. Come. We have to go.

01:37:00.346 --> 01:37:02.246
Come on, let's go.

01:37:48.528 --> 01:37:50.223
The kids are safe.

01:37:55.568 --> 01:37:56.830
Damn.

01:38:00.240 --> 01:38:03.266
- Who are you?
- What do you mean, who am I?

01:38:03.343 --> 01:38:06.676
I'm the guy who brought you here.
Now, we got to go.

01:38:07.413 --> 01:38:09.244
Where the hell am I?

01:38:09.315 --> 01:38:11.510
Listen to me. I'm a friend.

01:38:11.951 --> 01:38:14.647
- I'm a friend.
- Yeah? What's my name?

01:38:14.721 --> 01:38:17.747
- What's my name?
- Your name is Logan.

01:38:22.095 --> 01:38:24.723
You need to trust me. We have to go.

01:38:30.169 --> 01:38:31.602
Follow me.

01:38:37.110 --> 01:38:38.338
Now!

01:39:12.045 --> 01:39:13.672
Do you know her?

01:39:17.583 --> 01:39:18.914
No.

01:39:23.589 --> 01:39:25.716
Hey, these boys aren't gonna like
what you've done to this place.

01:39:25.792 --> 01:39:27.726
We really need to go.

01:39:28.394 --> 01:39:30.259
I'll find my own way.

01:39:35.201 --> 01:39:36.634
Good luck.

01:41:07.827 --> 01:41:09.454
Colonel Stryker?

01:41:13.766 --> 01:41:17.395
- Colonel William Stryker?
- Yes.

01:41:18.604 --> 01:41:20.572
You're wanted for questioning
in connection with the death

01:41:20.640 --> 01:41:23.131
of General Munson, sir.
