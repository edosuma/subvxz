00:07.208 --> 00:10.333
[indistinct chatter over PA)

00:13.750 --> 00:15.542
Identicard, please.

00:17.958 --> 00:20.292
[indistinct chatter over PA]

00:20.375 --> 00:22.875
[instrumental music]

00:25.500 --> 00:27.250
[beeping]

00:27.333 --> 00:28.625
Thanks.

00:45.500 --> 00:46.792
Commander.

00:53.875 --> 00:56.292
Benson, Dex wants his money.

00:56.375 --> 00:57.792
It's coming.

00:57.875 --> 00:58.917
I'll have the credits for him

00:59.000 --> 01:00.542
first thing tomorrow.

01:00.625 --> 01:03.708
- You said that yesterday.
- It's not my fault.

01:03.792 --> 01:05.292
Neither is this.

01:05.375 --> 01:06.417
[groans]

01:07.833 --> 01:11.292
Twenty-four hours, Benson.
Then we find you again.

01:11.375 --> 01:13.042
Then we cut your head off!

01:13.125 --> 01:14.375
[grunts]

01:18.125 --> 01:20.250
[panting]

01:23.250 --> 01:24.917
[door beeping]

01:30.917 --> 01:32.167
Come.

01:34.375 --> 01:36.292
- Were you followed?
- No.

01:38.292 --> 01:40.000
I've identified the target.

01:41.500 --> 01:44.000
[instrumental music]

01:47.458 --> 01:49.042
When do we take him out?

01:50.208 --> 01:51.542
Soon.

01:58.083 --> 02:01.833
(male narrator)
It was the dawn
of the Third Age of mankind

02:01.917 --> 02:04.917
10 years after
the Earth-Minbari War.

02:05.000 --> 02:08.542
The Babylon Project
was a dream given form.

02:08.625 --> 02:11.792
Its goal, to prevent another
war by creating a place

02:11.875 --> 02:13.292
where humans and aliens

02:13.375 --> 02:15.958
could work out
their differences peacefully.

02:16.042 --> 02:18.875
It's a port of call,
home away from home

02:18.958 --> 02:23.958
for diplomats, hustlers,
entrepreneurs and wanderers.

02:24.042 --> 02:28.375
Humans and aliens,
wrapped in 2,500,000 tons

02:28.458 --> 02:32.333
of spinning metal,
all alone in the night.

02:33.833 --> 02:35.875
It can be a dangerous place.

02:35.958 --> 02:39.125
But it's our last,
best hope for peace.

02:39.208 --> 02:43.042
This is the story of the last
of the Babylon stations.

02:43.125 --> 02:45.500
The year is 2258.

02:45.583 --> 02:49.292
The name of the place
is Babylon 5.

02:49.375 --> 02:51.875
[instrumental music]

03:27.667 --> 03:29.792
[instrumental music]

03:44.917 --> 03:47.792
Benson, security level two.

03:47.875 --> 03:51.917
You wanted to see me,
commander? Chief.

03:52.000 --> 03:55.208
Mr. Benson, you haven't been
with us very long, have you?

03:55.292 --> 03:56.792
Six months, sir.

03:56.875 --> 03:59.250
When you signed on, were you
informed of the regulations

03:59.333 --> 04:03.667
about use of the casino
by station personnel?

04:03.750 --> 04:05.125
If I may ask--

04:05.208 --> 04:06.583
Security personnel
are prohibited

04:06.667 --> 04:08.458
from gambling
while on active duty.

04:08.542 --> 04:11.250
Off duty gambling is limited
to 50 credits per week.

04:11.333 --> 04:14.167
We hear you've been exceeding
those limits, Mr. Benson.

04:14.250 --> 04:15.917
That's not true, sir.

04:16.000 --> 04:17.875
You can check
the casino records.

04:17.958 --> 04:19.667
We have.

04:19.750 --> 04:21.292
But we both know
a lot of unregistered

04:21.375 --> 04:23.792
side-betting goes on, don't we?

04:23.875 --> 04:25.583
Our information is that,
you've been losing heavily.

04:25.667 --> 04:28.583
- Piling up debts.
- Your information's wrong!

04:31.250 --> 04:32.667
Look, okay, sir

04:32.750 --> 04:36.583
I-I do ride the limits
pretty close

04:36.667 --> 04:38.000
but I've never gone over.

04:38.083 --> 04:40.375
You understand our concern.

04:40.458 --> 04:42.333
If you were to get into debt
with the wrong people

04:42.417 --> 04:43.667
you'd be a security risk.

04:43.750 --> 04:45.500
'You could be compromised,
blackmailed.'

04:45.583 --> 04:46.833
Yes, sir.

04:46.917 --> 04:49.667
If you are in debt
to these people, Mr. Benson

04:49.750 --> 04:51.708
we will find out.

04:51.792 --> 04:53.417
Now I'm giving you
one last chance.

04:53.500 --> 04:56.125
If you have anything to tell us,
I suggest you do so.

05:03.083 --> 05:04.875
Very well then.

05:04.958 --> 05:06.292
I'm taking you
off active duty

05:06.375 --> 05:08.667
'pending the outcome
of the investigation.'

05:08.750 --> 05:10.167
'Dismissed.'

05:15.458 --> 05:18.917
He's lying. I can tell.

05:19.000 --> 05:20.583
Everyone lies, Michael.

05:22.000 --> 05:23.958
The innocent lie because
they don't wanna be blamed

05:24.042 --> 05:25.625
for something they didn't do.

05:25.708 --> 05:28.292
And the guilty lie because they
don't have any other choice.

05:28.375 --> 05:29.958
'Find out why he's lying.'

05:30.042 --> 05:32.083
The rest will take care
of itself.

05:36.625 --> 05:38.417
What about the power source?

05:38.500 --> 05:40.875
I couldn't bring it with me
into the station.

05:40.958 --> 05:43.292
An energy pod would've never
gotten past the scanners.

05:43.375 --> 05:46.333
So I improvised.
It'll be here.

05:52.042 --> 05:53.333
[beeping]

06:01.667 --> 06:04.000
And breathe out, please.

06:04.083 --> 06:05.417
[exhales]

06:05.500 --> 06:07.167
One more time.

06:09.042 --> 06:12.500
Excellent. That'll do fine.

06:12.583 --> 06:14.250
I appreciate this, ambassador.

06:14.333 --> 06:15.917
I never get to see
a Minbari up close

06:16.042 --> 06:17.792
unless there's something wrong.

06:17.875 --> 06:20.417
Chance to examining one of
your people in prime condition

06:20.500 --> 06:23.125
gives me a baseline
to operate from.

06:23.208 --> 06:26.125
I was talking to Dr. Hernandez
while I was waiting.

06:26.208 --> 06:29.458
- Mm-hmm.
- Is it true that you used to..

06:29.542 --> 06:32.000
Uh, what is the term?

06:32.083 --> 06:34.958
Hitchhike on starships?

06:35.042 --> 06:39.167
Yes, yes.
Well, I wanted to see it all.

06:39.250 --> 06:42.625
I traded my services
as ship's doctor

06:42.708 --> 06:44.625
in exchange for free passage.

06:44.708 --> 06:46.125
It didn't matter where
they were going as long as

06:46.208 --> 06:48.458
I get to see something
I haven't seen before.

06:48.542 --> 06:52.125
Naturally, all that ended
when the war started.

06:52.208 --> 06:56.000
Were you involved
in the war, doctor?

07:00.792 --> 07:04.208
Towards the end when, uh

07:04.292 --> 07:07.208
things got bad for our side

07:07.292 --> 07:09.292
those of us in xenobiology
were told

07:09.375 --> 07:11.167
to hand over our notes
on your people

07:11.250 --> 07:15.750
to be used in genetic
and biological warfare.

07:15.833 --> 07:17.208
And did you?

07:17.292 --> 07:20.875
I took an oath
that all life is sacred.

07:20.958 --> 07:24.000
I destroyed my notes rather than
have them used for killing.

07:26.583 --> 07:27.833
Thank you.

07:34.083 --> 07:36.083
(Stephen)
'What about you, ambassador?'

07:38.417 --> 07:41.333
What did you do during the war?

07:41.417 --> 07:43.958
A topic for another time.

07:45.583 --> 07:47.333
Good day, doctor.

07:50.083 --> 07:51.458
Good day.

07:55.292 --> 07:58.375
- You have it?
- Yeah, I got it.

07:58.458 --> 08:00.542
Biggest energy pod
I could find.

08:02.917 --> 08:04.333
Look, I don't know
what this is about

08:04.417 --> 08:06.750
and I don't wanna know,
I just want my money.

08:06.833 --> 08:08.750
The credits will be deposited
to your account

08:08.833 --> 08:11.208
within the hour,
that'll be all.

08:11.292 --> 08:13.875
- What about my transfer?
- That will be all.

08:13.958 --> 08:15.250
[door opens]

08:32.333 --> 08:34.667
[instrumental music]

08:37.292 --> 08:39.375
I think we're ready to proceed.

08:53.375 --> 08:55.542
(male #1)
Alpha 7 to Alpha Leader,
I'm hit!

08:55.625 --> 08:58.083
(Sinclair)
'Pull out! Pull out! Alpha 7!'

08:59.667 --> 09:01.917

'He's gone.
Picking up enemy transmissions.'

09:02.000 --> 09:04.125
(Sinclair)
'Stay in formation!'

09:04.208 --> 09:06.458
Hold the line. No one
gets through. No matter what.

09:06.542 --> 09:08.208
(Mitchell)
Understood.

09:08.292 --> 09:11.458
Alpha Leader, you have
a Minbari on your tail.

09:11.542 --> 09:13.167
[zapping]

09:14.958 --> 09:17.125
I'm on him. Targeting fighter!

09:17.208 --> 09:21.125
No, Mitchell, stay in
formation! It might be a..

09:21.208 --> 09:24.250
Oh, my God.
It's a trap! Mitchell!

09:24.333 --> 09:25.667
[gasps]

09:27.542 --> 09:29.333

10:00.583 --> 10:02.125

10:17.417 --> 10:19.000
Sinclair to Maintenance.

10:22.583 --> 10:23.875
Observation.

10:26.125 --> 10:27.583
Security.

[instrumental music]

11:02.792 --> 11:05.250
[music continues]

11:28.167 --> 11:31.042
This is Commander Sinclair.
All sectors, report in.

11:32.833 --> 11:34.667
All sectors, report.

11:38.167 --> 11:40.250
Earth Central,
this is Babylon 5.

11:41.917 --> 11:44.333
Earth Central, please respond.

11:48.708 --> 11:51.958
This is Earth Station Babylon 5
to all ships in Grid Epsilon

11:52.042 --> 11:53.792
please respond.

12:00.333 --> 12:01.875
Computer!

12:05.208 --> 12:06.708
(computer)
'Online.'

12:10.000 --> 12:12.625
Was an evacuation ordered
in the last eight hours?

12:12.708 --> 12:15.625
(computer)
'Negative. Condition, green.'

12:17.083 --> 12:19.625
Scan for any other life forms.

12:19.708 --> 12:24.375
(computer)
'Confirmed.
One other life form detected.'

12:24.458 --> 12:25.542
Location?

12:25.625 --> 12:28.708
(computer)
'Central corridor, Blue Sector.'

12:30.417 --> 12:32.958
[instrumental music]

12:39.458 --> 12:41.458
Computer. Computer!

12:45.083 --> 12:47.917
What the hell
is going on around here?

12:48.000 --> 12:50.583
(Knight Two)
'Maybe you're asleep.'

12:51.792 --> 12:53.625
'Maybe you're insane.'

12:54.750 --> 12:56.250
'Maybe you're dead.'

12:57.583 --> 12:59.667
'Maybe you're in hell!'

13:01.500 --> 13:04.750
'Not that it matters much,
Commander Sinclair'

13:04.833 --> 13:08.708
'because wherever you are,
wherever you go..'

13:10.583 --> 13:11.833
...you're mine.

13:19.750 --> 13:21.667
[instrumental music]

13:28.458 --> 13:30.750
[indistinct chatter]

13:34.042 --> 13:36.542
Mr. Garibaldi.

13:36.625 --> 13:39.208
- Ambassador.
- 'I apologize for intruding.'

13:39.292 --> 13:41.042
But I was supposed to meet
Commander Sinclair

13:41.125 --> 13:43.542
at the council room
an hour ago.

13:43.625 --> 13:46.792
He never came. I thought
you might have seen him.

13:46.875 --> 13:49.667
No, sorry. Have you tried
the observation dome?

13:49.750 --> 13:50.833
Yes.

13:50.917 --> 13:52.125
Lieutenant Commander Ivanova

13:52.208 --> 13:53.958
hasn't seen him
since last night.

13:58.083 --> 13:59.375
Commander.

14:01.042 --> 14:03.333
Commander, this is Garibaldi.

14:06.167 --> 14:08.750
If you'll excuse me,
I'll get back to you later.

14:11.667 --> 14:14.708
Who are you? What have you done
to my station?

14:14.792 --> 14:18.750
Nothing. You, however,
are a different story.

14:18.833 --> 14:21.042
'I'd like to say I have your
undivided attention'

14:21.125 --> 14:22.917
but it would not be true.

14:23.000 --> 14:26.750
Your mind is in here with me

14:26.833 --> 14:28.792
but your body is somewhere else.

14:28.875 --> 14:32.167
Wrapped in cybernetic implants
and pulse generators

14:32.250 --> 14:34.417
all tied up
in a cerebral matrix.

14:34.500 --> 14:36.417
A virtual reality cybernet.

14:36.500 --> 14:40.125
Then you're saying all of this
is a simulation, not real.

14:40.208 --> 14:42.917
What is real, commander?
This?

14:45.000 --> 14:46.625
Commander, there you are.

14:46.708 --> 14:48.583
I've been looking
all over the place for you.

14:48.667 --> 14:51.083
- Garibaldi?
- Oh!

14:52.792 --> 14:53.833
No!

14:54.708 --> 14:56.042
No need for alarm.

14:56.125 --> 14:59.458
As you said,
a simulation only. See?

15:01.667 --> 15:03.208
(Garibaldi)
'Commander!'

15:05.542 --> 15:06.583
Commander!

15:07.250 --> 15:09.458
Commander!

15:09.542 --> 15:11.375
How's it going, commander?

15:11.458 --> 15:14.083
(Knight Two)
'We can kill him
as many times as we like.'

15:14.167 --> 15:16.792
We're locked together,
here in your mind.

15:18.583 --> 15:23.333
It's a shadow play,
without form or substance.

15:23.417 --> 15:27.708
But I'm real, commander.
And you're real.

15:27.792 --> 15:33.375
And the pain,
the pain for you is also real.

15:33.458 --> 15:35.667
[instrumental music]

15:35.750 --> 15:37.833
[electricity crackling]

15:37.917 --> 15:39.250
Commander.

15:43.583 --> 15:44.875
[beeping]

15:48.417 --> 15:49.417
Commander.

15:49.500 --> 15:50.875
[knocking on door]
Jeff.

16:03.667 --> 16:05.708
[music continues]

16:05.792 --> 16:09.000
- Garibaldi to C&amp;C.
- Online.

16:09.083 --> 16:10.792
We have a problem.

16:16.500 --> 16:20.208
Cut cerebral discharge.

16:20.292 --> 16:22.500
Cutting power 50 percent.

16:28.500 --> 16:30.042
Curious, we have the memories

16:30.125 --> 16:33.042
of your entire life
to play around with.

16:33.125 --> 16:37.292
But your thoughts are rooted,
here in this station.

16:37.375 --> 16:39.750
It means a lot to you,
doesn't it?

16:39.833 --> 16:41.625
You said we?

16:41.708 --> 16:43.417
My associate
is watching over your body

16:43.500 --> 16:44.917
while I'm in here with you.

16:45.000 --> 16:47.417
He's making sure nothing
unfortunate happens to it

16:47.500 --> 16:50.708
until we get what we came for.

16:50.792 --> 16:52.792
To do that, we'll walk together

16:52.875 --> 16:55.208
across the bridge of
synapses and neurons

16:55.292 --> 16:57.958
into the very heart
of your memories.

16:58.042 --> 17:01.250
- Why are you doing this?
- To find the truth.

17:02.542 --> 17:05.417
Ten years ago, you were at
the Battle of the Line.

17:05.500 --> 17:08.792
The final and decisive battle
of the Earth-Minbari War.

17:08.875 --> 17:12.250
For 24 hours, you were out of
touch with Earthforce Defense.

17:12.333 --> 17:15.708
My ship was damaged.
I blacked out.

17:15.792 --> 17:18.167
So you testified.

17:18.250 --> 17:20.750
Just one problem.
I don't believe you.

17:20.833 --> 17:23.250
And I'm not the only one.

17:23.333 --> 17:25.500
It's been a long time, commander

17:25.583 --> 17:28.167
but we're finally
gonna get to the truth

17:28.250 --> 17:29.917
even if it kills you.

17:31.667 --> 17:34.000
- Anything yet? Not yet.
- No. You?

17:34.083 --> 17:35.250
I've pulled all essential
personnel

17:35.333 --> 17:36.500
and assigned them search party.

17:36.583 --> 17:37.958
But a place this big,
it could take days.

17:38.042 --> 17:39.167
We may not have days

17:39.250 --> 17:40.792
if the commander's hurt
or can't reply.

17:40.875 --> 17:43.125
I know, I've notified our base
in the Tigris Sector

17:43.208 --> 17:44.625
and asked them to track
every ship that's left

17:44.708 --> 17:45.958
in the last eight hours.

17:46.042 --> 17:47.458
(Garibaldi)
'You might also wanna send'

17:47.542 --> 17:48.833
a couple maintenance bots
outside the station

17:48.917 --> 17:50.083
on close proximity scan.

17:50.167 --> 17:51.417
Go over every inch of the hull.

17:51.500 --> 17:53.708
- What should they look for?
- A body.

17:53.792 --> 17:55.167
If someone shoved it outside

17:55.250 --> 17:57.750
the station's gravity
won't let it get far.

17:57.833 --> 17:59.167
Just in case.

17:59.250 --> 18:01.083
Mr. Garibaldi,
there are days I'm very glad

18:01.167 --> 18:03.500
I don't have to
think the way you do.

18:03.583 --> 18:05.667
(Knight Two)
'Your name is
Jeffrey David Sinclair.'

18:05.750 --> 18:07.667
'Rank, commander. Age, 39.'

18:07.750 --> 18:10.667
'Born on Mars Colony,
May 3rd, 2218'

18:10.750 --> 18:13.833
'9:15 a.m.
Earth Standard Time.'

18:13.917 --> 18:16.708
'Enlisted in
Earthforce Defense, 2237.'

18:16.792 --> 18:19.333
Promoted to fighter pilot, 2240.

18:19.417 --> 18:24.042
Promoted again to squad leader
less than a year later.

18:24.125 --> 18:26.167
'A career officer,
like your father'

18:26.250 --> 18:28.625
and his father and his father.

18:30.417 --> 18:34.375
Smart money said
you'd make admiral one day.

18:34.458 --> 18:37.542
So, what happened, commander?

18:37.625 --> 18:39.792
Where did you fall off
the merry-go-round?

18:39.875 --> 18:41.250
Go to hell.

18:41.333 --> 18:42.917
I don't have to
tell you a thing.

18:43.000 --> 18:44.792
And I'm betting,
you don't have a lot of time.

18:44.875 --> 18:46.542
Security's probably
turning this place

18:46.625 --> 18:48.167
'upside down looking for me.'

18:48.250 --> 18:50.875
Assuming
you're still on Babylon 5.

18:52.292 --> 18:55.083
Assuming we haven't
taken you somewhere else.

18:55.167 --> 18:59.375
But you're right, you don't
have to tell me anything.

19:00.792 --> 19:02.292
What about someone else?

19:03.333 --> 19:05.167
(Mitchell)
'Hello, commander.'

19:09.833 --> 19:11.542
(Sinclair)
'Mitchell?'

19:14.417 --> 19:16.875
Alpha Leader, you have
a Minbari on your tail.

19:16.958 --> 19:18.583
I'm on him. Targeting fighter!

19:18.667 --> 19:22.667
No, Mitchell, stay in formation!
It might be a..

19:22.750 --> 19:25.250
Oh, my God. It's a trap!
Mitchell!

19:25.333 --> 19:27.750
(Mitchell)
'I've got a clear shot. I could
take him, I could take him!'

19:27.833 --> 19:30.458
- 'Break off!'
- 'I'm hit! Ejecting!'

19:31.833 --> 19:33.250
[screams]

19:35.375 --> 19:38.625
Why did you do it, commander?

19:38.708 --> 19:40.417
Why did you betray us?

19:42.000 --> 19:43.500
Mitchell's dead.

19:45.500 --> 19:49.125
- This isn't real.
- We fought for you.

19:49.208 --> 19:51.708
We fought beside you
on the Line.

19:51.792 --> 19:54.208
We swore we would all
go down together.

19:55.792 --> 19:57.625
But you're alive.

19:57.708 --> 20:01.083
And we're dead because of you.

20:02.042 --> 20:03.417
It's not true.

20:04.708 --> 20:08.333
I tried to warn you,
but you wouldn't listen.

20:08.417 --> 20:10.125
'You never listened.'

20:11.542 --> 20:13.250
- I tried.
- What?

20:13.333 --> 20:16.333
- I tried!
- Tried to do what, commander?

20:17.542 --> 20:20.375
Afterburners on my mark! Mark!

20:20.458 --> 20:22.917
[intense music]

20:28.333 --> 20:31.125
You tried to ram
the Minbari cruiser, is that it?

20:31.208 --> 20:33.667
Yes. It was in my report.

20:33.750 --> 20:35.958
And then what?

20:36.042 --> 20:38.375
I don't remember.

20:38.458 --> 20:40.750
I blacked out.

20:40.833 --> 20:42.125
I've never been
able to remember.

20:42.208 --> 20:44.000
You don't want to remember.

20:44.083 --> 20:45.917
You don't want to
remember the 24 hours

20:46.000 --> 20:48.125
in which you betrayed your race.

20:48.208 --> 20:51.208
The day you became a traitor!
The day you so..

20:51.292 --> 20:52.583
That's enough!

20:53.917 --> 20:58.667
Well, well, looks like the pain
is real for both of us.

20:58.750 --> 21:01.250
[instrumental music]

21:12.625 --> 21:14.917
I just heard the news,
lieutenant commander.

21:15.000 --> 21:18.500
Is there anything I can do?
If the commander is missing--

21:18.583 --> 21:20.000
We're doing everything we can,
ambassador.

21:20.083 --> 21:21.875
Have you tried to telepath?
Talia Winters.

21:21.958 --> 21:24.292
She's a level P-5,
requires close proximity

21:24.375 --> 21:25.708
'or physical contact.'

21:25.792 --> 21:28.417
'She's not trained
for search and recover.'

21:28.500 --> 21:30.750
'All we can do
is hope for a break.'

21:33.000 --> 21:34.750
- Are you sure you're alright?
- Yes!

21:34.833 --> 21:36.833
It's just the way
you snapped out of the cybernet.

21:36.917 --> 21:38.250
I'm alright!

21:39.875 --> 21:41.500
He caught me by surprise,
that's all.

21:41.583 --> 21:42.708
He's tough.

21:42.792 --> 21:44.917
Breaking him
isn't gonna be easy.

21:45.000 --> 21:46.292
What's happening out there?

21:46.375 --> 21:48.083
All I know is
what I see on the monitors.

21:48.167 --> 21:49.708
'They're aware
the commander is missing'

21:49.792 --> 21:51.083
'and they've launched
a full search.'

21:51.167 --> 21:52.875
How long until
they hit this sector?

21:52.958 --> 21:55.375
Three, maybe four hours.

21:55.458 --> 21:57.292
He was right, not much time.

21:58.708 --> 22:00.708
- You should rest.
- No!

22:00.792 --> 22:01.958
No, we're close. I can feel it.

22:02.042 --> 22:03.625
The more
I walk through his mind

22:03.708 --> 22:07.042
the more I'm convinced
he's hiding something!

22:07.125 --> 22:09.208
But we have to
accelerate the program.

22:09.292 --> 22:12.000
Break his grip on reality.
Blur the lines.

22:12.083 --> 22:15.083
I can increase the dosage
of metazine another ten percent.

22:15.167 --> 22:16.750
But he might start
hallucinating.

22:16.833 --> 22:17.958
Do it.

22:18.042 --> 22:19.292
Then bring up
the cyberfield 30 percent

22:19.375 --> 22:20.750
and put me back inside.

22:20.833 --> 22:22.417
(Knight One)
'It's dangerous.'

22:22.500 --> 22:25.958
It could shatter his mind
or kill him.

22:26.042 --> 22:27.375
Then he dies.

22:31.500 --> 22:32.917
(man on radio)
'Moving through Blue Sector,
continuing search.'

22:38.167 --> 22:40.083
Chief, we've finished
Sectors Blue One

22:40.167 --> 22:42.083
through Blue Three,
so far nothing.

22:42.167 --> 22:44.042
Work your teams up into
smaller units, two men a piece.

22:44.125 --> 22:46.583
We need to cover more ground.
Put on everyone you can.

22:46.667 --> 22:48.750
We already have.
I even put in Miller and Benson.

22:48.833 --> 22:50.583
Benson?
He's a security risk.

22:50.667 --> 22:52.792
We pulled him off active duty
pending the investigation.

22:52.875 --> 22:54.583
I know. We checked his files.
He's clean.

22:54.667 --> 22:57.292
No debts. He's even got a
surplus in his station account.

22:57.375 --> 22:59.292
That's impossible.

22:59.375 --> 23:02.750
I checked the other day,
and he was tapped out.

23:02.833 --> 23:05.292
(male #2)
'Ah, see for yourself, he's got
5000 credits in his account.'

23:05.375 --> 23:08.083
Now, yeah, but this wasn't here
24 hours ago.

23:08.167 --> 23:09.583
But check this list of payments.

23:09.667 --> 23:10.875
'There's five grand
left in his account'

23:10.958 --> 23:12.792
'after he paid off
lots of debts.'

23:12.875 --> 23:16.500
Original deposit was...15,000?

23:16.583 --> 23:18.500
Where does a grunt like Benson
get 15 grand?

23:18.583 --> 23:19.958
I don't know.

23:20.042 --> 23:22.125
The deposit clears account
at 0300 hours.

23:22.208 --> 23:25.333
And four hours later at 0700,
the commander went missing.

23:25.417 --> 23:27.958
Find Benson, bring him here.
I wanna ask him some questions.

23:28.042 --> 23:29.375
Right.

23:32.208 --> 23:34.667
[instrumental music]

23:38.708 --> 23:41.042
(Knight Two)
'Increase cyberfield
30 percent.'

23:48.000 --> 23:52.167
'Let's see it, commander.
What are you hiding?'

23:52.250 --> 23:56.667
'What happened on the Line?
Push, commander.'

23:56.750 --> 23:58.292
'Remember.'

24:07.875 --> 24:10.167
[sighs]

24:10.250 --> 24:12.667
[dramatic music]

24:42.292 --> 24:44.083
What are you doing here?

24:47.458 --> 24:48.583
What do you want?

24:48.667 --> 24:51.750
[echoes]
What do you want?

24:58.875 --> 24:59.958
[groans]

25:02.083 --> 25:03.250
You've got to help me.

25:03.333 --> 25:04.958
The whole station's
looking for me.

25:05.042 --> 25:06.625
They think I had something to do
with the commander--

25:06.708 --> 25:08.500
I don't have time for this.

25:08.583 --> 25:11.625
- I don't care! All I want is--
- 'Ah!'

25:13.333 --> 25:14.750
What the hell was that?

25:14.833 --> 25:17.417
What have you got
going on in here anyway?

25:17.500 --> 25:19.542
[machine whirring]

25:21.250 --> 25:22.750
Oh, my God!

25:22.833 --> 25:24.625
Terminate!

25:24.708 --> 25:25.917
[gunshot]

25:26.000 --> 25:27.333
[groaning]

25:40.042 --> 25:43.167
You saw something, didn't you?
Just before you blacked out.

25:44.167 --> 25:45.833
I almost saw it with you.

25:46.708 --> 25:48.250
Grey, grey figures.

25:49.333 --> 25:51.208
What does this mean?

25:51.292 --> 25:52.708
When did this happen?

25:52.792 --> 25:54.792
What are you hiding?

25:54.875 --> 25:57.208
I'm not hiding anything.

25:58.208 --> 26:00.167
We all hide things,
commander.

26:01.583 --> 26:04.542
That's why we bounced
back here again, isn't it?

26:04.625 --> 26:05.792
This is where you hide?

26:05.875 --> 26:08.500
Behind duty and responsibility
and obligations.

26:08.583 --> 26:12.792
- Things you'd never understand.
- Wrong. You're wrong.

26:12.875 --> 26:16.042
We're both patriots
in our own way.

26:16.125 --> 26:19.917
If I fail, more will come after
me until the job is finished.

26:20.000 --> 26:22.583
But now it's time,
commander.

26:22.667 --> 26:25.167
We're going to find out
what else you're hiding.

26:25.250 --> 26:26.917
And we're going to find out now.

26:27.000 --> 26:29.500
[instrumental music]

26:36.792 --> 26:38.042
Where'd you find the body?

26:38.125 --> 26:39.458
Floating outside
the Red Sector.

26:39.542 --> 26:41.667
We linked in
as soon as we found it.

26:41.750 --> 26:42.792
There's not much left.

26:42.875 --> 26:44.000
It depressurized fast

26:44.083 --> 26:45.917
when it was shoved out
into space.

26:48.917 --> 26:50.750
It's Benson alright.

26:50.833 --> 26:52.917
Whoever killed him couldn't have
carried the body far

26:53.000 --> 26:55.583
without being noticed.

26:55.667 --> 26:58.292
Tell the search teams
to concentrate at Red Sector.

26:58.375 --> 27:00.333
Right.

27:00.417 --> 27:03.708
Commander.
Commander Sinclair.

27:04.958 --> 27:06.625
'For the last time'

27:06.708 --> 27:10.708
what happened
at the Battle of the Line?

27:10.792 --> 27:13.625
I was trying to ram
the Minbari cruiser.

27:15.125 --> 27:18.167
Then something passed
in front of my eyes.

27:18.250 --> 27:19.833
I blacked out.

27:19.917 --> 27:22.542
The next thing I know, it's 24
hours later and the war--

27:22.625 --> 27:24.125
The war was over!

27:24.208 --> 27:28.375
The Minbari had surrendered
on the eve of their victory.

27:28.458 --> 27:30.958
They gave up.
Just like that!

27:32.333 --> 27:33.542
And you expect us to believe

27:33.625 --> 27:36.250
that you slept through
the whole thing?

27:36.333 --> 27:39.000
Your ship was off the screens
for 24 hours.

27:39.083 --> 27:42.792
You didn't just black out.
Your ship disappeared!

27:42.875 --> 27:46.375
The screens malfunctioned.
The hearing proved that.

27:46.458 --> 27:48.792
Why are you doing all this?

27:48.875 --> 27:50.833
The Minbari didn't win
at the Line, they surrendered.

27:50.917 --> 27:54.750
Precisely my point!
They surrendered! Why?

27:57.583 --> 28:01.375
I think they took
one look at our defense

28:01.458 --> 28:04.458
and realized what it'd cost them
to invade Earth.

28:04.542 --> 28:07.042
Why risk lives
in a frontal attack

28:07.125 --> 28:09.083
when they could attack us
from within?

28:10.833 --> 28:14.250
But they needed a fifth column.
People like you.

28:14.333 --> 28:16.083
Look at Earth, commander.

28:18.000 --> 28:20.375
Alien civilization.
Alien migration.

28:20.458 --> 28:23.417
Aliens buying up real estate
by the square mile.

28:23.500 --> 28:25.792
Alien funding of Babylon 5.

28:25.875 --> 28:28.583
What they couldn't take by force

28:28.667 --> 28:30.417
they're corrupting inch by inch!

28:30.500 --> 28:32.750
What does that
have to do with me?

28:32.833 --> 28:35.917
Nobody wants to die,
especially not out there

28:36.000 --> 28:38.625
in the cold space,
so you surrendered.

28:38.708 --> 28:40.875
They took you aboard their ship

28:40.958 --> 28:44.417
fixed you some milk and cookies
and asked you to work for them

28:44.500 --> 28:47.042
be their eyes, their ears,
their voice.

28:48.708 --> 28:50.083
You agreed.

28:51.375 --> 28:53.708
You and God knows
how many other people!

28:54.625 --> 28:55.792
And then they let you go.

28:55.875 --> 28:59.583
You're insane.
I never betrayed Earth.

28:59.667 --> 29:04.583
How can you be sure? You just
said you don't remember!

29:04.667 --> 29:07.958
- Mitchell. What about Mitchell?
- That's enough!

29:08.042 --> 29:09.792
You talk about the war

29:09.875 --> 29:13.250
you talk Mitchell and the rest,
but you didn't know them.

29:13.333 --> 29:15.417
They were my friends.

29:15.500 --> 29:18.625
I watched them die one by one.

29:18.708 --> 29:20.833
For years afterwards,
whenever I saw a Minbari

29:20.917 --> 29:22.667
I had to fight the urge
to strangle them

29:22.750 --> 29:24.625
with my bare hands.

29:24.708 --> 29:28.875
All I could see was Mitchell
and the rest...dying.

29:30.000 --> 29:31.625
- Dying.
- Why?

29:31.708 --> 29:34.167
'Because we were outnumbered
and outgunned.'

29:34.250 --> 29:36.167
We never had a chance.

29:36.250 --> 29:38.208
You say we could have won,
but you weren't there.

29:38.292 --> 29:40.125
You didn't see them.

29:40.208 --> 29:43.917
When I looked at those ships,
I, I didn't just see my death

29:44.000 --> 29:46.500
I saw the death
of the whole damn human race.

29:46.583 --> 29:48.583
Then why did they surrender?

29:48.667 --> 29:51.667
I don't know!
Maybe the universe blinked.

29:51.750 --> 29:53.167
Maybe God changed his mind.

29:53.250 --> 29:55.417
All I know is that
we got a second chance!

29:55.500 --> 30:00.333
And in 10 years, nothing's
ever made you doubt your story

30:00.417 --> 30:03.292
that you blacked out,
is that it?

30:03.375 --> 30:06.125
No! Nothing.

30:09.000 --> 30:11.708
- Except..
- Except what?

30:13.083 --> 30:16.458
There's a hole in your mind.

30:17.958 --> 30:20.542
What was that, commander?

30:20.625 --> 30:22.500
Come on, you're close.

30:22.583 --> 30:24.250
You're almost there.

30:25.958 --> 30:27.958
What happened that day?

30:29.667 --> 30:31.917
What happened
at the Battle of the Line?

30:32.000 --> 30:35.042
Don't you want to know
just for yourself?

30:35.125 --> 30:37.875
Don't you want to know?

30:39.042 --> 30:40.292
Yes.

30:41.958 --> 30:46.708
- Yes, I do.
- Then go. Look, see.

30:47.500 --> 30:51.625
Now! Now. Now.

30:53.250 --> 30:54.750
(man on radio)
'Alpha 7 to Alpha Leader,
I'm hit!'

30:54.833 --> 30:57.750
(Sinclair)
'Pull out! Pull out! Alpha 7!'

30:59.292 --> 31:01.583
He's gone.
Picking up enemy transmissions!

31:01.667 --> 31:03.667
Stay in formation.
Hold the line!

31:03.750 --> 31:05.292
No one gets through,
no matter what.

31:05.375 --> 31:07.042
Understood.

31:07.125 --> 31:09.542
Alpha Leader, you have
a Minbari on your tail.

31:13.833 --> 31:15.417
I'm on him. Targeting fighter.

31:15.500 --> 31:19.458
No, Mitchell, stay in formation!
It might be a..

31:19.542 --> 31:22.083
Oh, my God.
It's a trap! Mitchell!

31:22.167 --> 31:24.833
(Mitchell)
'I've got a clear shot. I could
take him. I could take him.'

31:24.917 --> 31:27.458
- 'Break off!'
- I'm hit! Ejecting!

Not like this.
Not like this.

32:00.583 --> 32:03.000
If I'm going out,
I'm taking you bastards with me!

Who are you?

33:42.167 --> 33:43.583
I know you.

33:44.917 --> 33:46.375
I know who you are.

I have to report.

34:21.583 --> 34:23.292
Get back to my ship.

34:26.875 --> 34:29.333
[instrumental music]

34:31.542 --> 34:34.292
Got it?
Now, listen to me next time.

34:34.375 --> 34:35.708
No more, huh?

34:35.792 --> 34:38.333
I'm sorry, alright?
I didn't mean it.

34:41.833 --> 34:44.583
- Well, just get it done.
- Alright.

34:56.750 --> 34:58.875
[music continues]

35:19.792 --> 35:21.083
Commander.

35:22.083 --> 35:23.208
Commander!

35:24.167 --> 35:25.250
[gunshot]

35:27.833 --> 35:30.042
Security to C&amp;C.
I found the commander!

35:30.125 --> 35:31.167
I'm following him..

35:31.250 --> 35:32.417
Ah!

35:34.375 --> 35:36.667
(Ivanova)
'Security, this is C&amp;C.
Please repeat.'

35:37.667 --> 35:40.292
Security?
Where did it come from?

35:40.375 --> 35:42.042
Red Six, level two.

35:42.125 --> 35:43.708
I'm on it.

35:43.792 --> 35:47.667
Commander! Commander Sinclair,
please report in.

35:47.750 --> 35:51.333
Commander? Commander Sinclair,
please report in.

35:51.417 --> 35:54.458
[indistinct chatter]

36:00.042 --> 36:01.792
[gunfire]

36:01.875 --> 36:03.542
- Look out!
- Get down!

36:07.458 --> 36:08.792
What the..

36:08.875 --> 36:10.042
[grunts]

36:10.125 --> 36:12.250
Commander, I..

36:12.333 --> 36:14.417
What the hell?
Commander?

36:14.500 --> 36:16.750
- 'Mr. Garibaldi.'
- Yeah, go.

36:16.833 --> 36:18.250
We found someone in Red Three.

36:18.333 --> 36:19.917
I think this is where
they kept the commander.

36:20.000 --> 36:22.250
Looks like he's been treated
with psychotropic drugs.

36:22.333 --> 36:24.042
He may be delusional, confused.

36:24.125 --> 36:27.042
In his present state,
he may be considered dangerous.

36:27.125 --> 36:28.417
[gunshot]

36:28.500 --> 36:30.667
Yeah. Yeah, thanks.
I kind of got that impression.

36:30.750 --> 36:32.667
Keep me informed.
Garibaldi out.

36:33.667 --> 36:34.958
Look.

36:37.792 --> 36:39.625
Ambassador! Stay back!

36:46.250 --> 36:48.417
It's me, commander.

36:49.958 --> 36:51.583
'You're safe.'

36:53.125 --> 36:55.042
No one will harm you.

36:59.042 --> 37:00.125
Stop.

37:02.083 --> 37:03.333
I know.

37:05.875 --> 37:07.958
I know you.

37:08.042 --> 37:10.583
I know who you are.

37:10.667 --> 37:13.417
(Delenn)
'I'm your friend, commander.'

37:15.375 --> 37:17.250
Ambassador Delenn.

37:19.042 --> 37:20.667
Your friend.

37:21.542 --> 37:23.000
No!

37:24.125 --> 37:25.542
I know you.

37:31.417 --> 37:33.167
I know you.

37:35.250 --> 37:36.625
[groans]

37:45.000 --> 37:46.667
Welcome home.

37:50.083 --> 37:52.583
[instrumental music]

38:01.667 --> 38:04.125
- How long have I been out?
- About a day.

38:04.208 --> 38:06.000
I managed to flush
the rest of those drugs out.

38:06.083 --> 38:07.958
But your system
has been through a shock.

38:08.042 --> 38:10.667
- Where's the prisoner?
- On his way to Bay 12.

38:10.750 --> 38:13.167
He's being transferred to a
shuttle headed for home.

38:13.250 --> 38:15.583
Earth Central
exercised jurisdiction.

38:15.667 --> 38:17.667
'They want him back
on Earth for trial.'

38:17.750 --> 38:19.250
Why there instead of here?

38:19.333 --> 38:21.208
They say he's part
of an organization back home

38:21.292 --> 38:23.500
who's trying to prove collusion
between Earth officials

38:23.583 --> 38:24.833
and the Minbari.

38:24.917 --> 38:26.833
There's a rumor
it's a covert operation

38:26.917 --> 38:29.208
run from somewhere
inside the government.

38:29.292 --> 38:31.208
Well, I don't know what
they're gonna get out of him.

38:31.292 --> 38:32.583
When you broke out
of the cybernet

38:32.667 --> 38:34.083
you set up
a neural feedback charge

38:34.167 --> 38:35.958
that fried most of his memory.

38:36.042 --> 38:37.875
I wanna see him.

38:37.958 --> 38:39.875
- I don't think that's a--
- Now!

38:48.792 --> 38:50.125
Just a sec.

38:51.125 --> 38:53.833
We need the prisoner
for a moment.

38:53.917 --> 38:55.250
Alone.

38:56.458 --> 38:57.750
He's all yours.

39:01.625 --> 39:04.042
(Sinclair)
'You never told me your name.'

39:04.125 --> 39:06.417
I don't..

39:07.500 --> 39:09.167
...remember.

39:09.250 --> 39:11.250
You couldn't pull off something
this big without help.

39:11.333 --> 39:14.792
Who sent you?
Who are you working for?

39:16.167 --> 39:19.542
I can't...help you.

39:21.333 --> 39:24.500
I...don't..

39:24.583 --> 39:27.208
...r-remember a-anything.

39:30.500 --> 39:33.250
It's no use, commander.
We've tried.

39:33.333 --> 39:35.625
He's gone. Move him out.

39:40.208 --> 39:42.875
- Commander.
- 'Command..'

39:42.958 --> 39:45.167
Commander Sinclair.

39:46.875 --> 39:48.417
There's..

39:50.208 --> 39:51.917
There's something in my head.

39:53.417 --> 39:55.000
It says..

39:56.375 --> 39:58.792
...maybe you're still inside.

40:00.125 --> 40:03.292
Maybe we-we're both
still inside.

Come.

40:46.208 --> 40:50.083
- Commander, you are better?
- Yes.

40:50.167 --> 40:51.667
I wanted to thank you
for your help.

40:51.750 --> 40:55.125
I was pretty messed up.
Delusional.

40:55.208 --> 40:58.792
Strange that seeing you is the
only thing snapped me out of it.

40:58.875 --> 41:00.500
I'm glad that I could help.

41:01.958 --> 41:04.583
Now, I suggest rest.

41:04.667 --> 41:06.375
'It will help you heal.'

41:08.167 --> 41:10.250
Commander.

41:10.333 --> 41:12.500
Out of curiosity

41:12.583 --> 41:15.958
do you remember anything
from your experience?

41:21.458 --> 41:22.750
No.

41:23.542 --> 41:26.333
Sorry, not a thing.

41:32.792 --> 41:35.250
[instrumental music]

41:39.667 --> 41:41.750
He must never know
what happened.

41:41.833 --> 41:45.708
If he should find out
he must be killed.

41:47.250 --> 41:49.333

42:14.333 --> 42:15.917
I remember.

42:17.667 --> 42:18.917
I was..

42:20.417 --> 42:23.167
...taken inside
a Minbari cruiser.

42:25.292 --> 42:26.750
Interrogated.

42:28.708 --> 42:29.958
Tortured.

42:32.375 --> 42:33.708
Was that..

42:36.542 --> 42:39.292
...the Grey Council?

42:39.375 --> 42:40.667
Maybe.

42:41.500 --> 42:42.875
Maybe.

42:44.375 --> 42:45.500
Before they surrendered

42:45.583 --> 42:48.625
they must have
blanked my memory..

42:48.708 --> 42:50.417
...and let me go.

42:52.167 --> 42:54.708
And Delenn,
what was she doing there?

42:56.125 --> 42:58.917
What is it they don't want me
to remember?

43:02.083 --> 43:03.958
I have to find out.

43:07.750 --> 43:09.292
I have to.
