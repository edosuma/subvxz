00:05.788 --> 00:08.182
I'm afraid there's nothing
pleasurable about this visit.

00:08.225 --> 00:09.748
This is John Rogers,

00:09.792 --> 00:11.533
special prosecutor from
the Department of Justice.

00:11.576 --> 00:13.491
Where's Executive
Assistant Director Mosley?

00:13.535 --> 00:14.579
OCHOA:
He's looking for blood.

00:14.623 --> 00:16.364
He's gonna dig deep
into all of you.

00:16.407 --> 00:17.843
CALLEN:
It's a cartel hit list.

00:17.887 --> 00:19.410
SABATINO: They haven't
identified your team,

00:19.454 --> 00:20.890
but they have provided security
photos and descriptions.

00:20.933 --> 00:22.500
Turk isn't so lucky,

00:22.544 --> 00:25.677
and neither is your Executive
Assistant Director Mosley.

00:25.721 --> 00:26.896
They know who she
is and they got

00:26.939 --> 00:27.897
a million dollars
on her head,

00:27.940 --> 00:29.899
along with her kid.

00:29.942 --> 00:31.422
My son won't be safe
until he's with me.

00:31.466 --> 00:32.815
Now, you launched a private war

00:32.858 --> 00:34.382
in a foreign country
to get your son back.

00:34.425 --> 00:36.514
See, I'm not gonna allow you
to do the same here.

00:36.558 --> 00:38.038
I need to protect my son.

00:38.081 --> 00:41.128
You won't be able to do so
from jail.

00:41.171 --> 00:42.694
Now stand down.

00:42.738 --> 00:44.783
Thank you for this.Happy to help.

00:44.827 --> 00:46.176
He'll be safe here.

00:46.220 --> 00:48.048
He's got a bounty on his head.

00:48.091 --> 00:50.572
And if something happens
to me, then who...

00:50.615 --> 00:51.834
Nothing is going
to happen to you.

00:51.877 --> 00:53.444
We'll keep him safe,

00:53.488 --> 00:54.924
but you have to fix this.

01:01.583 --> 01:03.367
MOSLEY:
Hey, sweetie, it's Mom.

01:03.411 --> 01:05.195
I just wanted
to leave you a message

01:05.239 --> 01:06.979
for when you wake up
in the morning.

01:07.023 --> 01:11.506
I hope you are having fun
and you're being helpful.

01:11.549 --> 01:15.640
And I promise that I will give
you a call as soon as I can.

01:15.684 --> 01:18.339
You're gonna see me real soon.

01:18.382 --> 01:20.384
I love you.

01:29.785 --> 01:32.135
EDDIE:
One of those days, huh?

01:33.354 --> 01:36.139
Is it that obvious?

01:36.183 --> 01:38.402
It's going around.

01:38.446 --> 01:41.362
At least this one's almost over.

01:46.497 --> 01:48.238
I think it's this town.

01:48.282 --> 01:49.718
Is it me,

01:49.761 --> 01:51.937
or does it feel like everyone's
out to get you in L.A.?

01:51.981 --> 01:54.592
If only you knew.

01:54.636 --> 01:57.073
Here's to survival.

01:59.554 --> 02:01.251
Excuse me.

02:01.295 --> 02:04.559
Sorry, folks,
that was last call.

02:04.602 --> 02:06.430
I can have someone
bring something up to
your rooms, though.

02:06.474 --> 02:08.867
No, thank you.Okay.

02:08.911 --> 02:11.087
New York or Miami,
we'd just be going out.

02:11.131 --> 02:13.742
Hmm.

02:13.785 --> 02:15.570
I got
a fully stocked minibar

02:15.613 --> 02:17.049
if you want to share a nightcap

02:17.093 --> 02:19.095
and a $50 bag
of chips.

02:28.539 --> 02:29.888
Oh.

02:29.932 --> 02:33.065
Very nice. A suite.

02:33.109 --> 02:35.764
Company's paying for it
to impress our clients.

02:35.807 --> 02:39.159
If they could, I'd probably be
camped out on Skid Row.

02:41.248 --> 02:42.292
What's your poison?

02:42.336 --> 02:44.076
Oh, uh, tequila.

02:44.120 --> 02:45.208
You got it.

02:45.252 --> 02:47.384
Do you mind
if I use your restroom?

02:47.428 --> 02:49.386
It's right through there.

02:49.430 --> 02:50.866
Great.

03:15.673 --> 03:17.849
I hope you don't mind
I borrowed your robe.

03:19.329 --> 03:21.288
Not at all.Ah.

03:21.331 --> 03:22.637
Thank you.

03:22.680 --> 03:24.029
Wait.

03:24.073 --> 03:25.857
You're not a professional,
are you?

03:25.901 --> 03:28.208
Excuse me? I'm sorry.

03:28.251 --> 03:31.167
I'm not gonna
have to pay for this, am I?

03:31.211 --> 03:33.213
Well, that depends
on whether or not

03:33.256 --> 03:34.605
you count breakfast.

03:35.693 --> 03:37.086
I can expense that.

03:38.348 --> 03:40.307
To breakfast.

03:41.351 --> 03:42.961
Cheers.

She's not returning my calls.

Maybe Deeks can

06:00.316 --> 06:02.710
Yeah, he's working on that.

Why do you even know that?

06:17.333 --> 06:18.290
It's just something I do.

06:18.334 --> 06:19.901
Never mind.

06:19.944 --> 06:21.816
I don't even want to know.

06:21.859 --> 06:23.687
Because, um,
this isn't your home.

06:23.731 --> 06:25.907
I thought you was moving

06:25.950 --> 06:28.779
I'm making a few changes first.

06:34.481 --> 06:36.700
uh, ejection seat toilet?

06:36.744 --> 06:38.354
I didn't know about the toaster.

06:38.398 --> 06:41.052
Uh, speaking of homes,
did yours sink?

06:41.096 --> 06:42.706
I went by your

06:42.750 --> 06:43.925
Your boat's not there.

06:43.968 --> 06:46.144
Tom borrowed it.

06:46.188 --> 06:48.408
What about Derrick?

06:48.451 --> 06:50.192
He went with him.

06:50.235 --> 06:51.715
Where?

06:51.759 --> 06:54.849
Not a clue. I bailed after
we passed the breakwater.

06:54.892 --> 06:56.764
H-Hold on a second. Mosley's son

06:56.807 --> 06:58.592
is on your boat with
your Navy SEAL buddy,

06:58.635 --> 07:00.158
and you have no idea
where they are?

07:00.202 --> 07:04.380
You promised her you'd get
her kid back. You did.

07:04.424 --> 07:05.773
I promised her

07:05.816 --> 07:08.906
I'd protect him. I am.

07:08.950 --> 07:10.560
He's running dark.

07:10.604 --> 07:11.909
I don't even know
where Tom's headed.

07:11.953 --> 07:14.042
And you were gonna
tell me this when?

07:14.085 --> 07:15.130
I wasn't.

07:15.173 --> 07:16.784
For the same reason
I don't want

07:16.827 --> 07:18.960
to know where they are.Mm-hmm.

07:19.003 --> 07:20.483
Do you know where Mosley is?

07:20.527 --> 07:22.616
No. She's still radio silent.

07:24.182 --> 07:26.489
Hetty?

07:26.533 --> 07:28.099
Nothing.

07:28.143 --> 07:31.755
For all I know,
she's still in Mexico.

07:31.799 --> 07:33.757
Well, if she is,
that's not good, G,

07:33.801 --> 07:35.846
because we're in some
serious trouble here.

07:35.890 --> 07:37.979
We revealed
a corrupt Mexican general,

07:38.022 --> 07:39.633
we brought down a
notorious arms dealer.

07:39.676 --> 07:41.722
Those are not bad things.

07:41.765 --> 07:42.940
An agent was killed.

07:42.984 --> 07:45.508
In Mexico, on her own.

07:45.552 --> 07:48.163
We were there to
find her. Look...

07:48.206 --> 07:50.600
There's nothing we can do
to bring her back at this point.You're right.

07:50.644 --> 07:52.515
But we have a special prosecutor

07:52.559 --> 07:54.865
who wants somebody
to answer for her death.

07:54.909 --> 07:57.302
Sooner or later,
Hetty and Mosley are gonna

07:57.346 --> 07:58.869
have to resurface,
and when they do,

07:58.913 --> 08:01.437
there are gonna be people
waiting for them.

08:01.481 --> 08:03.700
We might not be there
to protect them.

08:05.006 --> 08:06.964
NELL:
Hold on. Why do we need a pet?

08:07.008 --> 08:08.966
I've always had pets,
until recently.

08:09.010 --> 08:11.142
Okay, I am sorry
about the ant farm.

08:11.186 --> 08:12.753
Ant colony.

08:12.796 --> 08:14.450
Colony. If it's any consolation,

08:14.494 --> 08:15.843
I really don't think they died.

08:15.886 --> 08:17.845
They're just free
to explore now.

08:17.888 --> 08:19.847
Unlike my sea monkey family.

08:19.890 --> 08:22.240
Okay, one, that
should've been labeled.

08:22.284 --> 08:24.242
And two, I mean,
are they really a family?

08:24.286 --> 08:25.853
I raised them from eggs, Nell.

08:25.896 --> 08:27.507
11 generations.

08:27.550 --> 08:29.683
Beale, they are brine shrimp.

08:29.726 --> 08:33.425
So low on the food chain,
they're born to be food.

08:33.469 --> 08:35.079
And yet, they all had names.

08:35.123 --> 08:36.646
That is just weird.

08:36.690 --> 08:38.256
Okay?
Albeit impressive,

08:38.300 --> 08:40.955
that you kept the whole,
you know, family tree going

08:40.998 --> 08:43.435
and everything,
but still weird, nonetheless.

08:43.479 --> 08:44.567
No.

08:44.611 --> 08:46.569
All right, fine.
They're a family.

08:46.613 --> 08:50.094
11 glorious generations
of sea monkeys.

08:50.138 --> 08:53.228
No, the crime feed.Oh, God.

08:53.271 --> 08:57.101
Person of interest, homicide...

08:59.713 --> 09:02.542
Executive Assistant
Director Mosley?

09:12.029 --> 09:13.988
How long before
Special Prosecutor Rogers

09:14.031 --> 09:15.163
catches wind of this?

09:15.206 --> 09:17.600
Well, we should be okay

09:17.644 --> 09:20.777
until the, uh, local authorities
identify Mosley.

09:20.821 --> 09:23.301
It really is a graveyard.

09:23.345 --> 09:24.564
Sir, a graveyard?

09:24.607 --> 09:25.956
Uh, it's this office.

09:26.000 --> 09:27.654
That's what they call it
down in Quantico,

09:27.697 --> 09:30.004
"the graveyard."
People consider it cursed.

09:30.047 --> 09:33.181
Oh.I thought it was an East Coast,
West Coast joke, but no.

09:33.224 --> 09:36.097
Granger, Duggan, Hidoko.

09:36.140 --> 09:39.013
Okay, get our people
to the crime scene,

09:39.056 --> 09:42.320
and tell them: be discreet.

09:42.364 --> 09:44.366
Yep.

09:54.202 --> 09:56.247
CALLEN:
Hmm.

10:01.339 --> 10:03.211
Someone had a hell of a night.

10:03.254 --> 10:05.822
Mosley is too smart
and too cautious for this

10:05.866 --> 10:07.171
to have been
a mistake.

10:07.215 --> 10:09.173
She had to expect
it was a hit man.

10:09.217 --> 10:10.958
Well, she probably came back
to his room to find out,

10:11.001 --> 10:12.307
figured she'd get
the drop on him.

10:12.350 --> 10:13.917
Clearly, that didn't happen.

10:13.961 --> 10:15.223
No.

10:15.266 --> 10:17.312
But he is dead, and she isn't.

10:17.355 --> 10:20.663
There's no way she walked away
from this without injuries.

10:20.707 --> 10:23.144
Initial police report said
the deceased didn't have

10:23.187 --> 10:25.537
any personal effects on him,
nothing in the safe.

10:25.581 --> 10:27.365
Mosley must have taken
everything.

10:28.410 --> 10:30.412
They think they're hunting her.

10:30.455 --> 10:33.241
I get the feeling
she's hunting them.

10:37.288 --> 10:38.420
OCHOA:
She killed him?

10:38.463 --> 10:40.204
Yeah, it was a
hell of a struggle.

10:40.248 --> 10:41.423
Clearly, it was
self-defense.

10:41.466 --> 10:42.642
Well, why didn't she call it in?

10:42.685 --> 10:44.121
She may be trying
to keep us out of it.

10:44.165 --> 10:45.906
We found her.
Or at least we know

10:45.949 --> 10:48.691
where she was 16 minutes ago,
Central Library on Fifth.

10:48.735 --> 10:50.301
She created a VPN to try to hide

10:50.345 --> 10:52.260
her location, then used
her NCIS laptop

10:52.303 --> 10:56.351
and CAC card reader to log into
our system and access files.

10:56.394 --> 10:59.528
Our dead guy from the hotel,
he worked for the Molina cartel.

10:59.571 --> 11:02.357
Oh, same as the two ladies
who tried to unfriend us

11:02.400 --> 11:03.575
a couple weeks back.

11:03.619 --> 11:05.099
SAM: Yeah, they're all
trying to cash in

11:05.142 --> 11:06.796
on the bounties put on Mosley,
Derrick, and the rest of us.

11:06.840 --> 11:08.842
ERIC: Right, but here's
where it gets interesting,

11:08.885 --> 11:12.019
Mosley was accessing files
on a different cartel,

11:12.062 --> 11:14.238
Los Asesinos--
they're new players.

11:14.282 --> 11:15.544
Not really.

11:15.587 --> 11:17.067
Carlos Gutierrez

11:17.111 --> 11:20.462
ran Los Trece Reyes gang
for years, until he was killed.

11:20.505 --> 11:21.768
Now his gang
reportedly

11:21.811 --> 11:23.378
fell apart without
his leadership

11:23.421 --> 11:25.728
and split into two new factions:
Los Asesinos,

11:25.772 --> 11:27.295
The Assassins,

11:27.338 --> 11:29.993
and Los Chicos Dorados,
The Golden Boys.

11:30.037 --> 11:31.038
What?

11:32.474 --> 11:35.216
You can take the kid
out the barrio, but anyway...

11:35.259 --> 11:36.739
So these two seemingly
separate gangs,

11:36.783 --> 11:39.524
with distinct territories
and their own leadership

11:39.568 --> 11:41.309
are still rumored
to be controlled

11:41.352 --> 11:43.964
by Carlos's ex-girlfriend,
Ella Juanega.

11:44.007 --> 11:45.487
ERIC: But wait,
wait, wait.

11:45.530 --> 11:46.793
Mosley was looking
into her, too.

11:46.836 --> 11:48.490
I just didn't understand
the connection

11:48.533 --> 11:50.274
'cause, uh, she's, like,
a super legit

11:50.318 --> 11:53.364
successful businesswoman
with no ties to any of this.

11:53.408 --> 11:54.931
Hold on, she's been untouchable,
but don't let that fool you.

11:54.975 --> 11:56.933
She's more dangerous
than her male counterparts,

11:56.977 --> 11:58.282
and she hates
the Molina cartel.

11:58.326 --> 12:00.241
They killed her
boyfriend, Carlos.

12:00.284 --> 12:02.852
Mosley could be trying to cut
a deal with another cartel

12:02.896 --> 12:04.288
to get the Molinas off her tail.

12:04.332 --> 12:06.247
That's a risky deal to cut
with the devil.

12:06.290 --> 12:07.378
Yeah, well,
she's desperate.

12:07.422 --> 12:08.771
Which makes her dangerous.

12:08.815 --> 12:10.294
You can't go to Ella Juanega
empty-handed,

12:10.338 --> 12:13.254
so the question is:
what is she gonna offer her?

12:13.297 --> 12:15.473
I could lock her
out of the system.

12:15.517 --> 12:18.781
No. That's the only way we have
of tracking her right now.

12:18.825 --> 12:20.435
We need to find her
before anybody else does,

12:20.478 --> 12:22.045
law enforcement
or cartel.

12:22.089 --> 12:24.656
So do you think we can
draw her out using her son?

12:24.700 --> 12:25.657
No.

12:25.701 --> 12:27.398
That'd put the
two of them at risk.

much of a choice.

I mean, we're all scheduled

it's an emergency.No, the last thing

12:46.809 --> 12:48.332
you want to do is alert them
to something being up.

12:48.376 --> 12:50.421
As a matter of fact,
the longer

12:50.465 --> 12:53.468
Detective Deeks can keep
Rogers occupied, the better.

12:53.511 --> 12:54.686

13:19.015 --> 13:20.669
Oh, yeah,
Detective Whiting.

13:20.712 --> 13:22.540
Yeah, no, I've been helping
her out with something.

13:22.584 --> 13:23.803
You know, we've actually
gotten very close

13:23.846 --> 13:24.934
since I saved her life.

13:24.978 --> 13:27.415
Is that written down

13:27.458 --> 13:29.417
in your little
book report there?

13:29.460 --> 13:31.288
No.

13:31.332 --> 13:32.768
Okay, well,
I can see why.

13:32.812 --> 13:35.162
She was kind of embarrassed,

13:35.205 --> 13:36.598
the scar and everything.

13:36.641 --> 13:38.600

shot in the throat.

13:38.643 --> 13:40.080
It was crazy.

13:40.123 --> 13:41.255
I was literally, like,

13:41.298 --> 13:42.822
holding her throat together,
you know.

13:42.865 --> 13:45.302
I had to put my paw in there,
try to stop the bleeding,

13:45.346 --> 13:47.087
but it just
kept pumping out,

13:47.130 --> 13:48.784
so much blood just

13:48.828 --> 13:50.612
splurting through my fingers.

13:50.655 --> 13:53.223
And she's looking at me,
and I'm looking down at her,

13:53.267 --> 13:54.921

in her eyes,

13:57.619 --> 13:59.012
an LAPD liaison

13:59.055 --> 14:01.710
would be in Mexico on an

that, can you?

24:12.363 --> 24:15.323
I've got this under control.
Now back away.

24:15.366 --> 24:16.498
We can't do that.

24:16.542 --> 24:17.673
You've got to trust me.

24:17.717 --> 24:19.980
We've made that mistake before.

24:20.023 --> 24:22.112
This is not what
it looks like, Callen.

24:22.156 --> 24:23.462
I just need a minute.Sam!

24:52.099 --> 24:53.622
Where'd Mosley go?I don't know.

25:07.593 --> 25:09.812
I can't see squat.Turn on your windshield wipers.

25:13.729 --> 25:16.340
Look out your window.Look out yourwindow.

25:18.168 --> 25:20.606
Eric, you got eyes on Mosley?

25:20.649 --> 25:21.694
I'm still looking.

25:21.737 --> 25:23.434
Uh, guys?

25:23.478 --> 25:25.001
I think your car's on fire.

25:25.045 --> 25:26.612
Yeah, thanks, Eric.

25:26.655 --> 25:28.439
Track that Tahoe, find Mosley.

25:31.486 --> 25:32.835
Hang on!

25:47.720 --> 25:50.374
I'm sure they can buff it out.

26:05.999 --> 26:07.348
So I understand
you and Detective Deeks

26:07.391 --> 26:08.610
have a relationship.

26:08.654 --> 26:09.785
Is that a problem?

26:09.829 --> 26:11.831
No. Well, the agency
frowns upon it,

26:11.874 --> 26:14.050
but I try to stay out
of my people's personal lives.

26:14.094 --> 26:16.749
Unfortunately, our Special
Prosecutor Rogers will not.

26:16.792 --> 26:18.402
He's gonna use it against you.

26:18.446 --> 26:19.621
Well, what's between us

26:19.665 --> 26:20.709
has nothing
to do with Mexico.

26:20.753 --> 26:22.015
In fact, we broke it off

26:22.058 --> 26:23.538
over my decision
to go there, so...

26:23.582 --> 26:25.105
Not sure that'll matter
to Rogers,

26:25.148 --> 26:27.063
but I appreciate the candor.

26:27.107 --> 26:28.587
You guys all right?

26:28.630 --> 26:29.718
Yeah, we're good.

26:29.762 --> 26:32.765
Car may need
a little extra Turtle Wax.

26:32.808 --> 26:34.418
Hmm.Mosley?

26:34.462 --> 26:36.899
We canvassed the area.
Eric's still searching.

26:36.943 --> 26:38.422
She ghosted.

26:38.466 --> 26:39.685
I can't believe
Mosley sold us out,

26:39.728 --> 26:41.512
especially when we
have her son.

26:41.556 --> 26:43.210
She didn't expect us
to find out.

26:43.253 --> 26:45.255
Ella Juanega gave Mosley
a phone.

26:45.299 --> 26:46.909
We may be able
to track it.

26:46.953 --> 26:49.477
Chances are that she'll leave it
on until they reach out to her.

26:49.520 --> 26:51.740
She's also got the phone she
took from the guy she killed.

26:51.784 --> 26:53.481
Hotel might be able
to get the number

26:53.524 --> 26:54.700
from his reservation.

26:54.743 --> 26:55.918
You think she'd risk using it?

26:55.962 --> 26:57.398
CALLEN: Probably not,
but that doesn't mean

26:57.441 --> 26:59.618
we can't get the twins
to try and turn it back on,

26:59.661 --> 27:00.923
and use it
to pinpoint her location.

27:00.967 --> 27:02.272
Get on it.

27:02.316 --> 27:03.491
Yeah, no,

27:03.534 --> 27:04.405
our special prosecutor is gonna

27:04.448 --> 27:05.841
have a party with all this.

27:05.885 --> 27:07.364
Deeks still with him?

27:07.408 --> 27:09.410
Yeah, he's still with him.It's too bad.

27:09.453 --> 27:11.325
We could use the help.

27:12.761 --> 27:14.763
DEEKS: That's a good question.
I mean, all I remember

27:14.807 --> 27:16.199
is getting on a plane

27:16.243 --> 27:18.201
in L.A. to go to Mexico,

27:18.245 --> 27:21.117
and then waking up
in the hospital in Los Mochis.

27:21.161 --> 27:24.599
Obviously, someplace between
said plane and said hospital,

27:24.643 --> 27:26.514
we were hit with a rocket
while we were in an SUV,

27:26.557 --> 27:29.343
which, turns out,
is not great for the resale.

27:29.386 --> 27:30.736
But I don't remember
any of that

27:30.779 --> 27:33.173
because I got
my melon rocked

27:33.216 --> 27:34.478
like a maraca at
a Ricky Martin concert.

27:36.567 --> 27:38.961
If you don't get that analogy,
there's a lot of shaking

27:39.005 --> 27:41.355
at a Ricky Martin concert.

27:41.398 --> 27:43.313
You know, Ricky Martin
gets after it.

27:43.357 --> 27:45.141
He's a good dancer--
if you don't believe me,

27:45.185 --> 27:46.447
you can look at
my medical records.

27:46.490 --> 27:48.405
I got a severe
grade 3 concussion,

27:48.449 --> 27:50.538
and because of that traumatic
brain injury,

27:50.581 --> 27:53.236
sadly, I have no recollection
of anything leading up

27:53.280 --> 27:54.411
to that moment.

27:54.455 --> 27:56.283
Well, that is convenient.

27:56.326 --> 27:59.634
But you do admit that you
and your team were in Mexico?

27:59.678 --> 28:01.201
No, no, I was, I was
definitely in Mexico.

28:01.244 --> 28:03.725
I came back with Montezuma's
revenge to prove it.

28:03.769 --> 28:06.641
I lost ten pounds, my
friends, the hard way.

28:06.685 --> 28:08.338
And I'm still not 100%.

28:08.382 --> 28:10.297
Speaking of which, glad
you brought that up.

28:10.340 --> 28:12.081
so if the bañoin this place
requires a clave,we should

28:12.125 --> 28:13.996
probably put that bad boy
on la mesa.

28:14.040 --> 28:15.476
You know?
Save us both some

28:15.519 --> 28:17.521
:
apestosa verguenza.

28:22.701 --> 28:24.093
What?

28:24.137 --> 28:25.834
Would you, uh,
excuse us for a moment?

28:25.878 --> 28:27.183
Where is she going?

28:27.227 --> 28:29.620
You going to Quiznos?
Can you grab me a six

28:29.664 --> 28:32.493
Can you grab me
a sparkling water?

28:32.536 --> 28:33.494
I'm feeling a little parched.

28:33.537 --> 28:36.018
Maybe the lime-flavored.

28:36.062 --> 28:39.718
Oh, we're turning that off
and she's leaving, huh?

28:39.761 --> 28:41.328
Wow.

28:41.371 --> 28:44.418
Is this the part where
you beat me with a phone book?

28:44.461 --> 28:46.550
Real talk, do they make
phone books anymore?

28:46.594 --> 28:47.638
Seems kind of
unnecessary,

28:47.682 --> 28:49.858
'cause we got
the Google machine.

28:49.902 --> 28:52.165
I bet it's, like, one of those
specialty fetish items,

28:52.208 --> 28:54.297
you know, where it just comes
blank, and that way, you can

28:54.341 --> 28:56.125
fill in your
little S&M sessions.

28:56.169 --> 28:58.388
I'm not here to judge you. You
just seem like that kind of guy.

28:58.432 --> 29:00.564
Actually, that's a really
good idea. We could sell those

29:00.608 --> 29:02.610
on the Home Shopping Network,
although that's my idea.

29:02.653 --> 29:05.526
But now you're not recording, so
it's just my word versus yours.

29:05.569 --> 29:06.614
Damn it.

29:06.657 --> 29:09.486
I could've been rich.

29:09.530 --> 29:11.401
I get it.

29:11.445 --> 29:13.664
I get it.

29:13.708 --> 29:17.799
I'm the Washington idiot
who doesn't get what you do.

29:17.843 --> 29:19.583
I never said that.

29:19.627 --> 29:22.021
And you can mock me
and this process,

29:22.064 --> 29:23.936
for your own pleasure,

29:23.979 --> 29:26.765
or to, uh,
buy your colleagues more time.

29:26.808 --> 29:29.637
What?But at the end
of the day,

29:29.680 --> 29:35.034
Detective, this was a serious
international incident

29:35.077 --> 29:37.819
that left a young woman dead.

29:37.863 --> 29:41.083
So you can
go ahead and make

29:41.127 --> 29:43.651
all the diarrhea jokes
that you want,

29:43.694 --> 29:46.785
but is that the best way for you

29:46.828 --> 29:51.180
to honor a fallen team member?

29:53.704 --> 29:58.231
Well, if this is your attempt
at hitting below the belt...

30:01.321 --> 30:04.019
...well played.

30:05.586 --> 30:07.022
NELL:
So,

30:07.066 --> 30:09.459
if someone were to take a
slightly unauthorized look

30:09.503 --> 30:11.635
into Mosley's financial records,
that someone would discover

30:11.679 --> 30:14.987
that she's totally liquid.
Completely cashed out.

30:15.030 --> 30:16.858
She's getting ready to run.

30:16.902 --> 30:19.426
And we're her last move
before she disappears.

30:19.469 --> 30:22.342
Eric, where are we
on the phones?

30:22.385 --> 30:24.126
I'm still trying to find
the one she was given,

30:24.170 --> 30:25.736
but I've got Dead Eddie's.

30:25.780 --> 30:27.303
It's off-line at the moment,
but it's been on

30:27.347 --> 30:29.523
here and there.
Here's where I've pinged it.

30:32.613 --> 30:33.832
Well, it's hard to guess
where she's going

30:33.875 --> 30:35.877
or what she's doing from this.I've also pulled

30:35.921 --> 30:37.879
the last conversation from
Dead Eddie's phone,

30:37.923 --> 30:39.489
without a warrant,

30:39.533 --> 30:40.926
so it's inadmissible
as evidence but, uh...

30:40.969 --> 30:42.144
Let's hear it.

30:42.188 --> 30:44.712
You're not gonna like this.

30:44.755 --> 30:48.847
Okay.It's Mosley's last conversation
with the Molina cartel.

30:50.326 --> 30:52.285
MAN:
Hello?

30:52.328 --> 30:54.722
MOSLEY:
Your latest sicariois dead.

30:54.765 --> 30:56.245
MAN:
Who is this?

30:56.289 --> 30:58.160
MOSLEY:
Shay Mosley, NCIS.

30:58.204 --> 31:01.424
You have a million dollar bounty
on my head and that of my son.

31:01.468 --> 31:03.383
I want both gone.

31:03.426 --> 31:06.212
MAN: You tell me where you are,
and we'll come meet to talk.

31:06.255 --> 31:09.041
MOSLEY: Don't be stupid.
I'll give the names

31:09.084 --> 31:11.870
and addresses of the others
you're looking for in exchange

31:11.913 --> 31:13.436
for immunity for my son and I.

31:13.480 --> 31:15.351
MAN: How do I know
this isn't a trick?

31:15.395 --> 31:17.136
MOSLEY: I'm bringing
one of them with me.

31:17.179 --> 31:18.137
MAN:
Where and when?

31:18.180 --> 31:20.791
MOSLEY:
I'll be in touch.

31:20.835 --> 31:22.532
She's double-crossing the cartel

31:22.576 --> 31:24.273
and selling us out
to both of them.

31:24.317 --> 31:25.709
Yeah, but who's
she bringing with her?

31:25.753 --> 31:27.059
Who knows? She's
probably lying.

31:27.102 --> 31:29.583
It's clearly not us,
and the only other person

31:29.626 --> 31:30.671
on the cartel
hit list...Turk.

31:30.714 --> 31:33.065
Is he still in California?

31:33.108 --> 31:35.719
Well, he accompanied you
to the medical center

31:35.763 --> 31:37.896
in San Diego, but then
we lost contact with him.

31:37.939 --> 31:39.593
He's got to be lying low
after Mexico.

31:39.636 --> 31:41.508
Someone within the agency
knows where he is.

31:41.551 --> 31:42.901
Maybe the deputy director does.

31:42.944 --> 31:44.815
We need an address, fast.

31:44.859 --> 31:45.904
Yep. Don't worry,
we're on it.

32:04.661 --> 32:06.489
You hungry?

32:23.550 --> 32:26.031
TURK :
Surf's up, leave a message.

32:26.074 --> 32:27.206
Callen, Sam,
he's still not picking up.

32:27.249 --> 32:28.729
Keep trying.

32:40.436 --> 32:41.960
Want a beer?

33:01.457 --> 33:03.851
Hey, Turk!

33:03.894 --> 33:06.027
It's Sam and Callen.

33:30.617 --> 33:32.706
That's a good guard dog.

33:35.056 --> 33:36.579
He's not here.

33:36.623 --> 33:39.887
Well, somebody was...
very recently.

33:39.930 --> 33:41.802
KENSI:
What do we have?

33:41.845 --> 33:44.196
So we just found the phone
Ella Juaniga gave Mosley.

33:44.239 --> 33:47.938
It's heading south on PCH,
just passed Leo Carillo Beach.

33:47.982 --> 33:48.809
And it's getting
an incoming call.

33:48.852 --> 33:50.158
MAN:
You have a deal.

33:50.202 --> 33:52.204
We will make the exchange
at the old mission camp

33:52.247 --> 33:55.207
off Latigo Canyon in one hour.

33:55.250 --> 33:56.295
MOSLEY:
I want Ella there.

33:56.338 --> 33:58.079
MAN:
That will not be possible.

33:58.123 --> 33:59.646
MOSLEY: Somebody tried
to kill me today.

33:59.689 --> 34:01.691
I'm not trusting anyone but her.

34:01.735 --> 34:03.345
No Ella, no deal.

34:05.173 --> 34:07.088
ELLA:
I will be there.

34:07.132 --> 34:10.135
We lost them. Mosley probably
dumped her burn phone.

34:10.178 --> 34:11.658
That's okay, we know
where they're going.

34:11.701 --> 34:13.007
Alert Callen and Sam.
I'm gonna head over there

34:13.051 --> 34:15.053
as a forward observer.Mm-hmm.
Uh-huh.

34:15.096 --> 34:17.272
Dead Eddie's phone
just came online.
Ugh.

34:17.316 --> 34:18.534
Do we have to
call him that?

34:18.578 --> 34:21.102
Well, he is dead
and his name was Eddie.

34:21.146 --> 34:22.930
Ah, true.

34:24.323 --> 34:27.239
Yeah?
NELL:
Hey, Callen. So Mosley just used

34:27.282 --> 34:29.415
Dead Eddie's phone to put in
a call to the Molina cartel.

34:29.458 --> 34:31.460
And get this: she set up

34:31.504 --> 34:33.375
an exchange to meet
them at the same time

34:33.419 --> 34:35.116
and location Ella Juaniga
gave her.

34:35.160 --> 34:37.684
She's pitting Los Asesinos
and the Molina cartel

34:37.727 --> 34:38.902
against each other.

34:38.946 --> 34:40.382
With Turk in the middle.

34:40.426 --> 34:41.731
Guess she's hoping
when the smoke clears,

34:41.775 --> 34:43.081
she'll be
the last one standing.

34:43.124 --> 34:45.126
This is making Mexico
look like a vacation.

34:45.170 --> 34:46.997
Yeah.

34:55.441 --> 34:56.746
All right, boys.

34:56.790 --> 34:57.660
In position.

34:57.704 --> 34:59.967
I got Mosley and Turk--

35:00.010 --> 35:03.579
he's on the ground. Looks like
he's cuffed, maybe unconscious.

35:03.623 --> 35:05.277
Any sign of the cartels?

35:05.320 --> 35:06.713
Not yet. Where are you guys?

35:06.756 --> 35:08.628
We're coming in from the north
on an old fire road.

35:08.671 --> 35:10.238
It's the only way to get in
without being spotted.

35:10.282 --> 35:12.153
Watch out for those snakes.

35:12.197 --> 35:14.199
Why does she do that?

35:24.426 --> 35:25.775
Car approaching.

35:35.045 --> 35:36.438
Who the hell is that?

35:36.482 --> 35:38.614
Not your concern.

35:38.658 --> 35:40.007
Where's Ella?

35:40.050 --> 35:41.922
She got tied up.

35:41.965 --> 35:45.099
I told you: no Ella, no deal.

35:45.143 --> 35:48.755
A million dollars
says otherwise.

35:51.671 --> 35:52.889
Where are the files?

35:58.330 --> 35:59.592
Guys, I got a second car
approaching.

36:04.379 --> 36:05.206
Who the hell is that?

36:05.250 --> 36:08.209
Relax, they're here for him.

36:14.824 --> 36:16.130
Hurry up, guys.

36:16.174 --> 36:18.350
This is about to go off
any minute now.

36:20.395 --> 36:21.266
They're Molinas!

37:05.310 --> 37:07.399
Check 'em.

37:10.576 --> 37:13.883
♪

37:13.927 --> 37:16.756
MOSLEY:
Callen!

37:23.589 --> 37:25.547
I told you to trust me.

37:25.591 --> 37:27.984
You sold us out to the cartels.

37:28.028 --> 37:29.203
I did not.

37:29.247 --> 37:33.120
Those were fake aliases,
you can ask Turk.

37:33.163 --> 37:36.776
I told you I would fix this,
and I will.

37:36.819 --> 37:38.386
But you got to let me go.

37:43.261 --> 37:45.393
I got to get my son.

38:08.895 --> 38:10.113
Clear.

38:10.157 --> 38:11.854
TURK: Clear.SAM: Kensi?

38:11.898 --> 38:13.900
KENSI:
Yeah?

38:13.943 --> 38:15.380
Yeah, I'm good. You?

38:16.424 --> 38:19.427
Where's G G?

38:19.471 --> 38:22.343
All clear.

38:22.387 --> 38:23.562
Where's Mosley?

38:23.605 --> 38:25.477
She's gone.

38:25.520 --> 38:26.478
Gone where?

38:26.521 --> 38:27.479
Well, I would guess that

38:27.522 --> 38:28.697
she went back to get her son.

38:28.741 --> 38:30.133
SAM:
How?

38:30.177 --> 38:32.310
I don't even know where he is
and he's on my boat.

38:32.353 --> 38:33.920
Do you really think
that she left Derrick alone

38:33.963 --> 38:35.704
with no way for them
to contact each other?

38:35.748 --> 38:37.793
I guarantee you
he has a cell phone on him.

38:37.837 --> 38:39.317
Okay, well, then Eric and Nell
are gonna find it

38:39.360 --> 38:40.230
and then we're gonna find her.

38:40.274 --> 38:41.144
No.

38:42.189 --> 38:44.539
This is over.

38:45.714 --> 38:47.499
TURK: Well, I wasn't
expecting you guys

38:47.542 --> 38:50.066
to show up,
but I'm damn glad you did.

38:50.110 --> 38:51.459
Wait, you were in on this?

38:51.503 --> 38:54.462
In on it?
This was my plan.

38:56.203 --> 38:57.552
SAM:
We should have known

38:57.596 --> 38:59.728
this was too crazy for even
Mosley to come up with.

38:59.772 --> 39:01.034
Thanks for sharing.

39:01.077 --> 39:03.166
Well, I figured you had enough
on your plate.

39:03.210 --> 39:04.254
Oh.

39:04.298 --> 39:05.778
It's good to see you.

39:05.821 --> 39:07.040
You know what, maybe next time
we meet at a restaurant

39:07.083 --> 39:08.781
or something.Where's the fun in that?

39:08.824 --> 39:09.956
CALLEN:
So what,

39:09.999 --> 39:11.174
now Los Asesinos
and the Molinas

39:11.218 --> 39:12.306
are at war
with each other?

39:12.350 --> 39:13.612
Well, better them
killing each other

39:13.655 --> 39:14.700
than killing us.

39:14.743 --> 39:16.266
SAM: You were hoping
they'd be doing it

39:16.310 --> 39:18.443
long enough for Mosley
and her son to disappear.

39:18.486 --> 39:20.619
I didn't say
it was a great plan.

39:24.100 --> 39:26.538
Mosley did ask me
to give you this.

39:26.581 --> 39:30.716
She said it's for
your recital.

39:33.501 --> 39:35.634
Where's my boy Deeks?

39:35.677 --> 39:38.637
DEEKS:
Executive Assistant Director

39:38.680 --> 39:40.595
Mosley's son was illegally taken

39:40.639 --> 39:42.423
across an international
border by his father,

39:42.467 --> 39:45.644
Spencer Williams-- a well-known
international arms dealer...

39:45.687 --> 39:47.689
...and fugitive from justice.

39:47.733 --> 39:50.605
During the process of gathering
credible information

39:50.649 --> 39:52.651
regarding the whereabouts
of EAD Mosley's son,

39:52.694 --> 39:54.566
Special Agent
Harley Hidoko

39:54.609 --> 39:56.350
took it upon herself

39:56.394 --> 39:58.439
to unilaterally cross
into Mexico...

39:58.483 --> 40:00.093
...to develop information.
Unfortunately,

40:00.136 --> 40:02.051
contact was lost

40:02.095 --> 40:04.445
with Special Agent Hidoko and
we took immediate measures...

40:04.489 --> 40:05.794
...to try and locate her,

40:05.838 --> 40:07.056
over the course of which,

40:07.100 --> 40:09.624
the location of
Mosley's kidnapped son

40:09.668 --> 40:12.061
was discovered.
An assessment was made...

40:12.105 --> 40:14.586
...that his current situation
was in extremis

40:14.629 --> 40:15.804
and getting worse
by the moment.

40:15.848 --> 40:17.676
OSP personnel,
believing

40:17.719 --> 40:19.808
that an American citizen--
a child--

40:19.852 --> 40:21.897
was in extreme danger,

40:21.941 --> 40:23.464
took it upon themselves
to rescue...

40:23.508 --> 40:25.248
...and repatriate him
in an exigent manner

40:25.292 --> 40:28.251
and in so doing,
regrettably,

40:28.295 --> 40:33.300
a loss of life and damage
to personal property occurred.

40:50.491 --> 40:54.626
Mr. Rogers has finished
his investigation.

40:54.669 --> 40:56.366
You will be pleased to know

40:56.410 --> 40:58.804
that your strikingly
corroborative statements

40:58.847 --> 41:00.588
and EAD Mosley's
insistence

41:00.632 --> 41:02.764
that she ordered you into Mexico
without informing anyone

41:02.808 --> 41:06.681
of the mission ahead of time,
essentially exonerates

41:06.725 --> 41:08.727
the rest of you.

41:10.250 --> 41:11.773
What about Hetty?

41:11.817 --> 41:15.473
Hetty, as well...
for the time being.

41:15.516 --> 41:18.867
Does anyone know
where EAD Mosley is now?

41:21.522 --> 41:23.045
Her son?

41:24.003 --> 41:25.483
You have no idea?

41:26.962 --> 41:28.355
None of you.

41:29.835 --> 41:33.142
Of course not.

41:33.186 --> 41:34.013
Bye, neighbor.

41:35.710 --> 41:37.625
So, listen,
I got a bar.

41:37.669 --> 41:40.454
It's not officially open
to the public yet,

41:40.498 --> 41:41.934
but it's got a fridge full
of frosty beverages

41:41.977 --> 41:43.631
and it would be our honor

41:43.675 --> 41:46.765
if you'd come down and have a
drink with us, Deputy Director.

41:46.808 --> 41:49.071
Thanks, but I've got to
head back to Washington

41:49.115 --> 41:50.508
to make sure Rogers makes good
on his promise.

41:50.551 --> 41:52.597
Fair enough.

41:52.640 --> 41:54.033
But next time for sure.

41:54.076 --> 41:55.643
Oh, and, uh,

41:55.687 --> 41:59.342
keep your heads down out there.KENSI: Thanks.

42:00.735 --> 42:02.476
Hmm.

42:02.520 --> 42:03.956
When is Christmas vacation?

42:03.999 --> 42:05.435
Seriously.

42:05.479 --> 42:06.828
You know
what we should do?

42:06.872 --> 42:08.351
We should call in sick
for a week,

42:08.395 --> 42:10.049
go someplace nice and quiet.

42:10.092 --> 42:11.441
Ooh, Bali.

42:11.485 --> 42:13.356
We could totally
go to Bali.DEEKS: Yeah, no.

42:13.400 --> 42:15.315
Like Bali but cheaper.

42:15.358 --> 42:16.359
There's always Hawaii.

42:16.403 --> 42:17.709
That's closer and cheaper.

42:17.752 --> 42:19.667
Mmm, I'm liking this.DEEKS: You know what?

42:19.711 --> 42:20.755
I'm actually loving this.

42:20.799 --> 42:22.409
That look means

42:22.452 --> 42:24.237
we're not, we're not
going to Hawaii, are we?

42:24.280 --> 42:25.891
KENSI: Ugh.CALLEN: Nope.

42:25.934 --> 42:29.547
DEEKS:  Can we just
at least go to San Diego?
