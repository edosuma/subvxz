00:00.293 --> 00:02.330
Previously on Mr Mercedes.

00:02.370 --> 00:05.244
Son. Can I help you? 
You already have.

00:05.395 --> 00:07.964
- Oh, my God. 
- Ah, it's you.

00:08.035 --> 00:09.057
Final offer.

00:09.093 --> 00:10.915
You keep the cash.
You give me the binders.

00:10.924 --> 00:12.684
I'm going to need you
to leave. Now.

00:12.693 --> 00:14.684
You think I'm fucking around?

00:14.817 --> 00:17.244
Got the location
from an anonymous tip.

00:17.271 --> 00:19.420
- Think this is our third man? 
- Seems like it.

00:19.440 --> 00:21.395
- What about the stolen goods? 
- Nothing.

00:21.413 --> 00:23.937
Let's find out who sells
Rothstein memorabilia.

00:23.973 --> 00:25.004
You think that's what they stole?

00:25.040 --> 00:27.235
That would explain their
buggering up the robbery.

00:27.244 --> 00:29.626
I thought all his shit
was archived at Ohio State.

00:29.680 --> 00:31.550
You killed John Rothstein.

00:31.644 --> 00:33.662
So you got the manuscripts?

00:33.697 --> 00:35.253
- No.
- You think I'm daft?

00:35.280 --> 00:38.640
I was the one who told you
about him hoarding cash.

00:38.666 --> 00:39.600
While I was in the hospital,

00:39.608 --> 00:41.635
somebody took the money
and the manuscripts.

00:41.671 --> 00:44.435
You got to find who took them.
You need to get them back.

00:44.453 --> 00:46.177
And I'm going to help you, Morris.

00:46.310 --> 00:49.075
I'm ordering that the
defendant be transferred

00:49.075 --> 00:51.457
- to the mental facility
in Columbus, - What?

00:51.466 --> 00:52.764
in order to make sure

00:52.764 --> 00:56.755
that you are mentally
competent to stand trial.

00:56.844 --> 00:58.248
You got to get me out of here.

00:58.257 --> 01:01.102
- He finds me in here.... 
- Brady Hartsfield?

01:01.111 --> 01:03.940
He finds me in here....

01:12.728 --> 01:17.075
Midway upon this
journey of our life,

01:17.102 --> 01:20.817
I found myself in a forest dark,

01:20.942 --> 01:24.568
savage, rough, stern,

01:24.764 --> 01:27.690
which in the very
thought renews fear.

01:29.191 --> 01:32.017
So bitter is it

01:32.222 --> 01:35.448
that death is little more.

01:35.786 --> 01:37.830
Dante was wrong.

01:37.848 --> 01:43.768
Most men hit the forest
when they're young

01:43.840 --> 01:47.475
and then spend the rest
of their lives lost.

01:47.528 --> 01:54.133
What you learn is,
the only way out is in.

01:54.160 --> 01:56.142
You got to go deeper.

01:56.151 --> 01:58.017
You got to look harder.

01:58.026 --> 02:00.790
You got to expose your heart.

02:00.820 --> 02:03.333
The devil's in the details.

02:03.377 --> 02:09.031
Most men don't have the
guts to look at them.

03:42.586 --> 03:44.444
She refuses to take her meds,

03:44.444 --> 03:46.604
which is not good
in and of itself.

03:46.604 --> 03:49.146
Worse, she says Brady Hartsfield

03:49.146 --> 03:49.155
is the one who's convinced her.
Worse, she says Brady Hartsfield

03:49.155 --> 03:50.577
is the one who's convinced her.

03:51.048 --> 03:52.213
Come again?

03:52.213 --> 03:55.140
He's evidently persuaded
her to just say no.

03:55.210 --> 03:56.417
She talks to Brady?

03:57.120 --> 04:00.222
And he answers back.
That's my bigger concern.

04:00.257 --> 04:02.050
Hi, hey, sorry.

04:02.062 --> 04:04.222
They got an ID on the man,

04:04.222 --> 04:05.253
the dead guy in the truck.

04:05.253 --> 04:07.751
Stan McNair,
a local repairman.

04:07.777 --> 04:09.395
Stan McNair. Stan the Man?

04:09.422 --> 04:11.190
Yeah, Montez called
with an address,

04:11.191 --> 04:13.075
so he said you can
just meet him there.

04:13.102 --> 04:14.124
- OK, thanks.
- Mm-hmm.

04:14.124 --> 04:15.688
Listen, we're going to
need you to manage Lou.

04:15.742 --> 04:17.101
Keep her tethered to the planet.

04:17.128 --> 04:20.007
Any and all emotional support
we can give her at this point.

04:20.017 --> 04:21.724
So where would I visit her?

04:21.857 --> 04:23.760
At the facility where she's at.

04:23.831 --> 04:25.315
The facility?

04:25.315 --> 04:28.080
They have visiting hours.
I can secure a private place.

04:28.088 --> 04:30.888
We need to rush this thing back
into court as fast as we can.

04:30.880 --> 04:33.404
Her competency eval
is in two days.

04:33.440 --> 04:35.520
Whatever we can do
to make her feel grounded.

04:36.302 --> 04:38.520
OK. Yeah, I'll go visit her.

04:38.590 --> 04:40.248
- I can do it. 
- No, I'll go.

04:40.266 --> 04:42.488
- Holly. 
- I can go.

04:44.995 --> 04:46.760
Sorry.

04:47.351 --> 04:50.711
No, I used to be in one of those
places, so that's....

04:50.782 --> 04:53.644
I mean, part of me thinks if 
I set foot in one again,

04:53.640 --> 04:56.515
they won't let me out,
but I know that's not true.

04:56.515 --> 04:59.470
It's just my anxiety, you know

04:59.475 --> 05:01.982
my over active
amygdala talking to me.

05:01.991 --> 05:05.555
So I just need to shush it.

05:06.293 --> 05:07.890
Shh, shh, shh.

05:25.564 --> 05:28.010
You never want
to have sex anymore.

05:29.688 --> 05:32.142
I told you,
I'm a little preoccupied.

05:32.510 --> 05:34.880
What, with your
real estate scheme?

05:35.368 --> 05:37.217
Yeah, I don't believe that.

05:37.804 --> 05:40.800
What 30-year-old guy
doesn't want to have sex?

05:40.808 --> 05:41.790
Damn it, Danielle!

05:41.804 --> 05:42.888
And that is the only emotion

05:42.888 --> 05:44.360
I ever get out of you
these days.

05:44.360 --> 05:46.497
You know what?
"Damn it, Danielle."

05:46.510 --> 05:49.217
- OK, that is not
good enough. 
- I am under some stress.

05:49.217 --> 05:51.191
- Yeah, so what else are you
not telling me?  - Nothing!

05:51.208 --> 05:52.284
Are you cheating on me?

05:52.320 --> 05:54.924
- What? 
- You are, aren't you?

05:54.924 --> 05:56.017
Jesus Christ!

05:56.017 --> 05:58.915
My mother once told me a man
never doesn't want to have sex.

05:58.915 --> 05:59.946
If he says he doesn't want it,

05:59.946 --> 06:01.724
then he just doesn't
want to have it with you.

06:01.724 --> 06:03.226
- Oh, God.   - And you know 
what else she'd say?

06:03.226 --> 06:05.360
She'd say, "Danielle",

06:05.377 --> 06:07.022
"if somebody doesn't
want to fuck you,"

06:07.022 --> 06:08.568
"then they must be
fucking somebody else."

06:08.568 --> 06:10.364
So who the fuck are you fucking?

06:10.364 --> 06:11.946
Would you keep your voice down?

06:11.946 --> 06:13.680
You are out of your mind!

06:14.400 --> 06:17.560
I'm actually well
with myself, Morrie.

06:17.590 --> 06:18.773
You, on the other hand,

06:18.773 --> 06:20.590
have been
a very different person.

06:21.530 --> 06:23.280
Something has happened.
Why the f....

06:24.746 --> 06:26.764
Why can't you tell me?

06:28.100 --> 06:31.040
Nothing has happened.

06:34.240 --> 06:37.480
OK, I know you're
a very complicated person.

06:37.510 --> 06:39.306
But I'm warning you that

06:39.333 --> 06:43.137
there are only so many
complications I can take.

06:55.400 --> 06:57.573
Hey, Saubers.

06:57.804 --> 06:59.297
Slow down a minute, man.

06:59.306 --> 07:00.497
Don't want to be
late for school.

07:00.497 --> 07:02.540
You trying to avoid us, Petey?

07:05.653 --> 07:07.448
Maybe if you ran
that fast on defence,

07:07.448 --> 07:09.377
you'd actually win a game.

07:10.737 --> 07:12.444
Very wrong answer.

07:12.444 --> 07:13.973
Let go of me, you dick.

07:14.195 --> 07:16.240
Look at you being brave!

07:16.240 --> 07:18.880
- We'll let you go. 
- No, no, no.

07:18.890 --> 07:22.488
First we've got some
transactional business to discuss.

07:22.533 --> 07:23.730
We'll be taking those shoes now.

07:23.760 --> 07:24.586
Fuck off.

07:24.604 --> 07:27.724
You're just full of wrong answers
today, aren't you?

07:27.813 --> 07:29.930
What the fuck, man?

07:29.964 --> 07:31.271
That's a fucking gun!

07:31.306 --> 07:33.240
Calm down, man.
We're just... Go.

07:48.986 --> 07:50.728
You're positive
he was shot here?

07:50.737 --> 07:51.831
Yeah, there's blood everywhere.

07:51.840 --> 07:55.297
Plus, we found the drill that
was used to burrow into his head.

07:57.700 --> 07:59.662
So the thinking is,
he was killed here

07:59.662 --> 08:02.640
and then placed in the
truck pre or post-crash.

08:02.737 --> 08:04.470
Post, most likely.

08:04.488 --> 08:06.410
Yeah, the neighbours say
he was a sweet guy.

08:06.440 --> 08:08.506
Some priors,
mostly for passing bad cheques,

08:08.506 --> 08:10.035
but totally harmless.

08:10.044 --> 08:12.862
I mean, he's got to be
connected somehow.

08:12.871 --> 08:15.688
We're either on the scent,
or this poor gobshite

08:15.688 --> 08:17.484
was used to throw us off it.

08:17.490 --> 08:19.342
- You got no leads at all, no? 
- No.

08:19.368 --> 08:20.790
Except what you were saying about

08:20.791 --> 08:22.071
Rothstein continuing to write.

08:22.106 --> 08:25.671
That checked out, but since we
found no writings at the house,

08:25.688 --> 08:27.530
they were most likely stolen.

08:27.822 --> 08:29.884
You on top of all
the auction houses?

08:29.893 --> 08:32.025
- We are. 
- All of them?

08:32.100 --> 08:34.852
Yes, all of them.

08:43.422 --> 08:45.253
- Hi.
- May I help you?

08:45.297 --> 08:47.280
Yes, I was just
looking for anything

08:47.288 --> 08:48.737
regarding John Rothstein.

08:48.835 --> 08:50.951
Mr Rothstein's papers
are only available to

08:50.951 --> 08:54.444
grad students, I'm afraid,
or professional researchers.

08:54.631 --> 08:57.875
OK. Can you make an exception?

08:57.875 --> 08:59.226
Well, if I started doing that,

08:59.230 --> 09:01.386
every Tom, Dick, and Harry
would want to see the papers.

09:01.386 --> 09:02.462
OK, well, look.
I grew up here.

09:02.462 --> 09:03.777
I go to Harvard,
and I'm thinking of

09:03.777 --> 09:06.130
basing my honours thesis on him.

09:06.170 --> 09:08.293
You go to Harvard?

09:08.382 --> 09:09.608
Yes.

09:09.700 --> 09:11.120
Harvard University?

09:12.440 --> 09:13.377
Yes.

09:13.413 --> 09:14.980
The one in Massachusetts?

09:15.010 --> 09:16.710
Ma'am, is there any other one?

09:17.790 --> 09:19.902
Why would you be here in Ohio?

09:19.991 --> 09:22.355
I'm just taking a semester off.

09:22.417 --> 09:24.130
Uh-huh.

09:24.130 --> 09:26.168
You have an ID?

09:26.240 --> 09:27.866
- Excuse me? 
- A student ID,

09:27.866 --> 09:30.871
one that verifies
you go to Harvard.

09:45.690 --> 09:47.937
I'm sorry, we don't get
many Ivy Leaguers here.

09:47.946 --> 09:49.404
Oh, yeah, I understand.

09:49.448 --> 09:50.808
I don't.

09:50.853 --> 09:54.330
Ivy League people tend to skip
over Ohio like we don't exist.

09:54.330 --> 09:56.728
Read and then sign
the rules, please.

09:56.740 --> 09:59.048
OK, of course.

10:02.595 --> 10:05.395
That's basically everybody
within a half-mile radius.

10:05.431 --> 10:08.510
All of them could have conceivably
walked to the crash site.

10:08.808 --> 10:10.693
Those are the
families with dogs.

10:10.728 --> 10:14.017
I figure dog-walking
increases the odds.

10:14.050 --> 10:16.220
- You took all these pictures?
- Most.

10:16.220 --> 10:18.720
Joy of a long lens.

10:18.720 --> 10:21.890
I also stood on the shoulder of
the road above the crash site.

10:21.890 --> 10:23.884
Nothing visible from Route Six.

10:23.893 --> 10:27.030
So I doubt anybody saw
anything and pulled over.

10:27.030 --> 10:28.800
More likely a hiker.

10:28.835 --> 10:30.764
So what's the next step?

10:30.764 --> 10:32.670
Break in their houses and look?

10:33.084 --> 10:35.940
No, Morris,
that would not be the next step.

10:35.946 --> 10:38.364
We're going to have to be
a little smarter than that.

10:38.560 --> 10:42.613
In fact, a lot
smarter, truth be told.

10:42.613 --> 10:44.880
I need to be my most smart.

10:45.564 --> 10:49.620
Jesus Christ.
It's 10:00 in the morning!

10:49.644 --> 10:51.090
Well, what's that
supposed to mean?

10:51.090 --> 10:52.808
You can't answer an early call?

10:52.800 --> 10:54.053
Did Jimmy Gold ever complain

10:54.053 --> 10:55.502
because a mission was too early?

10:55.520 --> 10:56.560
This is not about J...

10:56.568 --> 10:58.830
And don't tell me
this is not about Jimmy.

10:58.853 --> 11:00.728
Those books are out there, Morris.

11:00.746 --> 11:02.462
They're new stories,
new adventures,

11:02.462 --> 11:04.106
new roads taken by Jimmy

11:04.106 --> 11:06.044
that we may never, 
ever get to know about

11:06.044 --> 11:08.293
or go down unless
we find those manuscripts.

11:08.293 --> 11:10.391
We're not doing this for me.

11:10.610 --> 11:11.980
We're doing it for the money.

11:12.010 --> 11:13.662
We're doing it for literature.

11:13.780 --> 11:15.280
Now, eat your berries.

11:15.280 --> 11:16.924
You're going to need them, baby.

11:21.540 --> 11:23.911
That's it. That's it.

11:23.911 --> 11:25.990
Come on, Morris. Come on.

11:25.990 --> 11:27.022
Give me your strength.

11:27.022 --> 11:30.346
Oh! Oh! Oh, Jesus Christ!

11:30.400 --> 11:31.800
Oh! Danielle!

11:31.830 --> 11:33.715
What are you doing here?

11:34.702 --> 11:36.370
I'm prettier than I look.

11:36.430 --> 11:38.684
Wait, wait.
Did you follow me here?

11:38.693 --> 11:40.204
Oh, come.

11:40.800 --> 11:44.382
- Look, I can explain-- 
- Oh, you can explain this? - I can...

11:44.400 --> 11:45.457
That?

11:45.528 --> 11:47.370
I'm thinner than I look too.

11:47.475 --> 11:48.750
Danielle.

11:50.595 --> 11:51.697
Danielle.

11:51.742 --> 11:53.920
Wait, Danielle!

11:54.168 --> 11:55.490
Oh, my God.

11:56.690 --> 11:58.890
Oh, I'm sorry.

11:58.960 --> 12:00.755
She's your girlfriend, huh?

12:01.484 --> 12:04.097
Oh, I'm so sorry, Morris.

12:04.160 --> 12:07.448
Look, it's going to sound
cliche, but I'm going to say it.

12:07.511 --> 12:10.040
If it's meant to be,
she'll stay with you.

12:10.070 --> 12:11.940
And if she doesn't,

12:11.940 --> 12:14.782
she was never yours
to begin with.

12:15.822 --> 12:18.480
I'll make a fresh pot
of coffee, honey.

13:01.173 --> 13:02.746
You look worse than I do.

13:03.813 --> 13:06.760
I was once in a place
like this, which,

13:07.280 --> 13:11.466
you know, it was not
the best experience.

13:11.670 --> 13:13.662
Does rocking help?

13:14.186 --> 13:15.377
I beg your pardon? What?

13:15.404 --> 13:16.897
Your body,
it's rocking slightly.

13:16.897 --> 13:18.773
I see a lot of that in here.
Does that

13:18.773 --> 13:20.410
- Yeah. 
- help?

13:20.533 --> 13:22.720
It probably is....

13:22.737 --> 13:26.497
There might be something
womb-like about it.

13:26.620 --> 13:28.897
Oh, that's....

13:29.220 --> 13:33.413
Sounds nice.
Maybe I'll try that.

13:33.502 --> 13:38.568
So, your exam is coming up,
and your lawyer....

13:38.568 --> 13:40.666
Yeah, he's afraid
I'm not going to pass.

13:40.737 --> 13:42.115
Yes.

13:43.800 --> 13:46.170
He says that you're
psychologically regressing.

13:46.186 --> 13:48.195
That's why he sent you, right?

13:48.440 --> 13:51.022
He said that Brady
is talking to you,

13:51.022 --> 13:54.880
that he's telling you not to
take your meds. Is that true?

13:54.977 --> 13:56.168
Yes.

13:56.320 --> 13:59.644
You see him a lot, Brady?

14:00.728 --> 14:02.684
Off and on.

14:02.773 --> 14:04.490
When's the last time?

14:16.737 --> 14:20.140
He's here right now.

14:20.142 --> 14:22.510
He's telling me
not to listen to you.

14:22.540 --> 14:23.910
OK.

14:25.724 --> 14:27.991
Does he say why?

14:28.480 --> 14:33.920
Basically he says
he's all I got

14:33.920 --> 14:38.053
and that if I take the meds,
it might serve to expunge him.

14:38.053 --> 14:40.995
And once he's gone....

14:44.586 --> 14:46.097
OK.

14:46.200 --> 14:49.340
Lou, I suspect
that you sense that

14:49.342 --> 14:52.310
this is you talking to you,

14:52.311 --> 14:54.995
not really Brady, right?

14:56.168 --> 14:58.408
Yeah.

14:58.693 --> 15:00.595
Sometimes I know that.

15:00.980 --> 15:02.631
OK.

15:05.368 --> 15:08.044
Sometimes I don't.

15:09.057 --> 15:11.360
I do know one thing, though.

15:12.755 --> 15:17.128
As angry as I am at him,

15:17.857 --> 15:22.320
he's the closest thing that
I ever had to family or friendship.

15:24.370 --> 15:28.780
So, if I'm going to be stuck
in here with all these flatliners,

15:28.880 --> 15:30.462
I don't know.

15:30.550 --> 15:33.262
Might be good to have his

15:33.520 --> 15:35.120
company.

15:35.164 --> 15:36.720
OK.

15:36.720 --> 15:39.031
You realise that if you say
anything like this

15:39.031 --> 15:41.160
to a psychiatrist,
you will be stuck in here?

15:41.190 --> 15:45.128
You can't be telling the doctor
that he's talking to you.

15:47.048 --> 15:49.360
He's talking to you now.

15:51.528 --> 15:53.368
What's he saying?

15:54.577 --> 15:57.653
He's saying,

15:58.906 --> 16:04.248
"What is the big deal
with freedom?"

16:04.850 --> 16:09.973
"What's so great about
the great out there?"

16:10.008 --> 16:13.253
Might be a good thing
that I'm in here.

16:19.404 --> 16:24.071
There's a certain
safety in here

16:24.071 --> 16:26.311
that out there doesn't offer me.

16:30.257 --> 16:33.368
I'm not a vulgar person.

16:34.017 --> 16:36.000
And I think that
people throw around

16:36.000 --> 16:38.133
the F word way too easily but

16:38.133 --> 16:40.933
sometimes it is
necessary to make a point.

16:40.995 --> 16:44.080
And I'm going to
make one right now.

16:45.244 --> 16:49.653
There's no fucking safety
in this place.

16:51.564 --> 16:52.900
Hmm?

16:58.951 --> 17:02.231
These two are fairly
representative of the collection.

17:02.230 --> 17:04.151
I'd start here.

17:12.088 --> 17:13.297
Rejection letters?

17:13.367 --> 17:14.665
From publishers.

17:14.675 --> 17:16.986
The other box
contains hate mail.

17:16.986 --> 17:19.146
We've got 20 boxes of those.

17:19.191 --> 17:20.462
Why would he keep these things?

17:20.462 --> 17:23.777
Rothstein mainly donated his
papers to get a tax write-off.

17:23.795 --> 17:25.200
He had to give us something.

17:25.300 --> 17:28.115
And so he gave you hate mail?

17:29.422 --> 17:31.253
Man, we got to be
missing something.

17:31.253 --> 17:33.140
There has to be something more.

17:33.140 --> 17:35.380
I mean, he was about
his details, right?

17:35.410 --> 17:37.210
He was good at holding grudges,

17:37.217 --> 17:40.711
especially against those
who rejected or hated him.

17:41.050 --> 17:43.502
I think he was inspired
by the letters.

17:45.120 --> 17:50.160
- You say these boxes are representative
of his collection, right?  - Mm-hmm.

17:50.266 --> 17:52.755
Do you have any boxes
that are not representative?

18:25.582 --> 18:27.440
Danielle?

18:43.253 --> 18:45.260
Danielle.

18:52.560 --> 18:55.270
Danielle, please look at me.

19:01.191 --> 19:04.280
This is not about
me and you, OK?

19:04.657 --> 19:07.102
And I know

19:07.102 --> 19:10.888
how crazy that has
to sound, that

19:10.968 --> 19:15.390
me having sex
with another woman

19:15.395 --> 19:17.191
doesn't speak to you and me.

19:17.200 --> 19:18.986
She's older than Mount Rushmore.

19:18.986 --> 19:22.835
It speaks to a lot of
shit, none of it good.

19:27.386 --> 19:30.568
I've known Alma since

19:30.560 --> 19:32.540
I was a boy,

19:32.542 --> 19:35.810
a choirboy, you could say.

19:36.124 --> 19:37.850
What does that mean?

19:41.386 --> 19:45.120
I lost my virginity to her
when I was 13 years old.

19:45.288 --> 19:47.790
She got me into this

19:47.795 --> 19:49.930
psychological

19:50.835 --> 19:55.502
headlock, which
she's still got me in.

19:55.537 --> 19:58.270
So you've been fucking
this woman since you were 13?

19:59.413 --> 20:03.528
It has nothing to do with us,

20:03.528 --> 20:05.210
with you and me.

20:05.351 --> 20:07.360
Is that what you really think?

20:07.386 --> 20:11.333
I mean, you really believe that?

20:11.395 --> 20:13.866
Morris, this is a sickness.

20:14.231 --> 20:17.360
- Probably. 
- Probably nothing. It is.

20:17.386 --> 20:18.871
I mean, she's a paedophile.

20:18.871 --> 20:22.160
- If you were 13 years old, then... 
- It won't happen again.

20:23.262 --> 20:24.853
I love you.

20:25.573 --> 20:28.008
I don't believe that.

20:28.017 --> 20:30.684
And I don't think
you believe it either.

20:32.370 --> 20:33.540
Look.

20:35.768 --> 20:38.542
We all have our shit.

20:38.586 --> 20:40.257
I know I have mine.

20:42.808 --> 20:45.306
But yours,

20:46.257 --> 20:48.808
and this Alma lady,

20:48.808 --> 20:51.742
there is no more me and you.

20:51.795 --> 20:54.630
Whatever shit
I signed up with for you,

20:54.631 --> 20:57.271
I didn't sign up for this.

20:57.537 --> 21:00.270
Don't leave me,
Danielle. I need you.

21:01.777 --> 21:04.142
I need you.

21:20.195 --> 21:22.720
I don't think she'll pass.

21:22.728 --> 21:25.431
I mean, she's not good.

21:25.431 --> 21:28.080
And the longer that
she stays in there is....

21:30.160 --> 21:31.866
Is she on medications at all?

21:31.920 --> 21:35.777
According to the doctors, yes, 
but I'm not so sure.

21:36.000 --> 21:38.853
Brady was in the room
as I spoke to her.

21:38.906 --> 21:40.595
- She said that? 
- Yes,

21:40.595 --> 21:42.880
and she's convinced
he'll be in the room

21:42.880 --> 21:44.648
when she takes the exam and

21:44.648 --> 21:47.724
he told her he plans to make
the doctor's eyes bleed.

21:47.720 --> 21:50.115
Jesus fuck.

21:50.284 --> 21:53.090
He's convincing her that
she belongs in the hospital or,

21:53.090 --> 21:55.902
you know, she's convincing
herself and using him as a conduit.

21:55.902 --> 21:57.560
But either way, I mean,

21:57.697 --> 22:02.030
is there any way
we can call off this exam

22:02.100 --> 22:04.900
because she's clearly, not ready?

22:04.970 --> 22:06.844
I don't know.

22:06.880 --> 22:10.168
I mean, like you say,
she could be even worse the day after.

22:10.337 --> 22:13.010
I'm meeting with her
in the morning, so I'll

22:13.013 --> 22:17.137
try and convince her
not to listen to Brady, but...

22:18.071 --> 22:19.564
How are you bearing up?

22:19.733 --> 22:20.950
Me?

22:21.050 --> 22:22.000
Mm.

22:22.684 --> 22:25.022
Can't have been easy,
going there.

22:25.075 --> 22:26.524
No,

22:26.524 --> 22:29.560
it was not.
It was not at all, but....

22:30.035 --> 22:31.930
I shouldn't have put you
in that situation.

22:31.930 --> 22:33.920
Well,

22:34.008 --> 22:36.862
according to Brady, you know, 

22:36.862 --> 22:38.853
through Lou, that's what you do,

22:38.853 --> 22:42.284
you know,
put people in situations.

22:43.510 --> 22:44.640
She said that?

22:44.666 --> 22:46.595
Well, she's saying
that Brady said that.

22:46.640 --> 22:48.391
You put Lou in a room with Brady

22:48.391 --> 22:50.195
because it served your interests and

22:50.195 --> 22:52.195
that you don't really
care about people

22:52.195 --> 22:54.720
in the end so much as
you care about your quest.

22:58.590 --> 23:01.351
Of course,
I told her that's not true.

23:12.835 --> 23:14.746
They're saying on the news that 

23:14.740 --> 23:16.293
that crash might
have something to do

23:16.293 --> 23:18.380
with the Rothstein murder.

23:18.410 --> 23:20.450
Plot thickens every day.

23:20.480 --> 23:23.066
Maybe the driver
killed John Rothstein.

23:24.106 --> 23:25.751
You sound excited.

23:26.820 --> 23:29.386
I'm not excited.

23:29.511 --> 23:32.568
Just that it happened
in our own backyard.

23:32.577 --> 23:34.830
- Hmm.  
- Our property value may go up.

23:34.830 --> 23:37.768
It's the celebrity of it all.

23:37.840 --> 23:40.088
That's not how
that works, Marjorie.

23:41.822 --> 23:43.470
You're the broker.
You should know.

23:45.484 --> 23:47.840
They're also saying

23:47.840 --> 23:50.524
that guy didn't die in the crash,

23:50.524 --> 23:52.408
the one in the truck.

23:52.506 --> 23:55.946
He was shot in the head,
just like John Rothstein.

24:42.100 --> 24:44.200
Whoever our anonymous tipster,

24:44.204 --> 24:47.102
I'd figure it's one of
the houses up around here.

24:47.164 --> 24:49.940
Oh, I can look up the registry,

24:49.940 --> 24:52.195
- see who lives exactly where.
Good.

24:52.257 --> 24:53.671
Yup.

24:53.715 --> 24:56.280
So we know nothing
about this tipster?

24:56.380 --> 24:58.933
- No, protected by law.
- Oh.

24:58.951 --> 25:01.484
The man obviously
didn't give his name.

25:01.484 --> 25:04.890
That's what we mean
by the word "anonymous."

25:06.290 --> 25:07.760
Oh, yeah.

25:07.813 --> 25:09.182
Go on. Say it.

25:09.226 --> 25:11.386
Fucking Harvard.

25:11.530 --> 25:13.973
I mean, we know he's
a "he", though, right?

25:14.026 --> 25:15.600
Yeah, Montez gave
that much away.

25:16.400 --> 25:18.960
There's a kid and a dog.

25:35.715 --> 25:37.555
Boogers.

25:41.688 --> 25:45.262
I understand that he
either talks to you or

25:45.262 --> 25:47.200
that you think he does.

25:47.200 --> 25:49.546
What I am stressing,

25:49.546 --> 25:51.670
and I cannot stress this enough,

25:51.680 --> 25:53.671
the examiner cannot know this.

25:53.671 --> 25:55.111
It's going to be a woman.

25:55.288 --> 25:57.600
- I'm sorry? 
- The doctor who's examining me,

25:57.608 --> 25:58.400
it's going to be a woman.

25:58.435 --> 26:00.471
Brady says it'll be
a she and that

26:00.471 --> 26:04.240
she'll have these bloodshot eyes.

26:05.150 --> 26:08.275
Lou, the first step

26:08.275 --> 26:10.480
is we get you
out of here, OK?

26:10.660 --> 26:12.542
Maybe I should
be in here, Holly.

26:12.542 --> 26:14.186
OK, stop saying that.

26:14.204 --> 26:15.840
I mean, do you want
a life with no freedom

26:15.848 --> 26:18.675
where you get visited
by Brady Hartsfield?

26:18.800 --> 26:21.066
Come on. That's not a life.

26:21.111 --> 26:23.546
Now, we can help you get better,

26:23.546 --> 26:25.848
but you have to pass
this exam first.

26:25.840 --> 26:29.084
Why? So he can
get his 15 minutes?

26:29.146 --> 26:30.657
Excuse me?

26:30.711 --> 26:33.884
Isn't that what this
is about, Roland? Huh?

26:33.911 --> 26:37.680
It's kind of like
a lottery ticket for you

26:37.697 --> 26:40.220
career-wise, mm.

26:40.290 --> 26:44.346
Right? You, the DA, everyone.

26:44.417 --> 26:47.230
Just trying to get a little
piece of the spotlight, Roland?

26:47.230 --> 26:48.826
Is Brady telling you that?

26:48.862 --> 26:51.395
- Is he wrong? - HOLLY: Yes, he's
very wrong, OK?

26:52.168 --> 26:54.933
OK, you're here
because you shot somebody.

26:54.933 --> 26:56.440
All right, he didn't put you here.

26:56.444 --> 26:58.000
Bill Hodges didn't put you here.

26:58.008 --> 27:00.222
You did this to yourself.

27:00.222 --> 27:02.906
And if it's not on you,
then it's on Brady Hartsfield.

27:02.915 --> 27:05.404
You're actually going to
listen to him?

27:05.440 --> 27:07.440
He stabbed you once.

27:07.448 --> 27:10.115
You going to let him
stab you again?

27:12.026 --> 27:14.346
I don't see how she
passes, you know?

27:14.346 --> 27:15.395
I just don't.

27:15.422 --> 27:18.230
Well, we did our best.
I think she heard you.

27:18.260 --> 27:19.991
Let's hope.

27:20.053 --> 27:22.426
And thanks for
standing up for me.

27:22.586 --> 27:25.644
Yeah, well, she was wrong
to say what she said.

27:26.302 --> 27:29.048
Do you want to grab
breakfast or something?

27:29.102 --> 27:30.915
- Have you eaten? 
- What?

27:30.960 --> 27:34.666
Breakfast. There's this diner
about three miles away.

27:34.666 --> 27:36.880
- Buckwheat pancakes. 
- Oh, I would never....

27:37.822 --> 27:40.755
Never what?
Eat buckwheat pancakes?

27:40.808 --> 27:42.755
No, have breakfast.

27:42.960 --> 27:45.786
Oh, you could never
eat breakfast.

27:46.720 --> 27:52.062
OK yeah, I see, the amygdala's going into overdrive.

27:52.133 --> 27:55.700
I know a little bit
about racing amygdalas.

27:55.770 --> 27:56.770
Yeah.

27:59.217 --> 28:03.310
Racing amygdalas. Fucking idiot.

28:23.493 --> 28:26.300
Help you?

28:26.488 --> 28:28.700
Oh, I'm just looking.

28:28.746 --> 28:31.262
For anything in particular?

28:31.368 --> 28:33.810
Well, you got any
of John Rothstein's books?

28:33.840 --> 28:37.537
I wish. Sold out.

28:37.573 --> 28:40.071
Getting killed was a
good career move for him.

28:40.071 --> 28:42.550
I can't even keep
his paperbacks in stock.

28:43.031 --> 28:44.462
What about first editions?

28:44.506 --> 28:46.640
Rothstein first editions?

28:46.702 --> 28:49.688
Well, I mean,
he did live around here.

28:49.742 --> 28:53.102
I ain't got any first editions.

28:54.930 --> 28:58.044
Have you ever sold any?

28:58.044 --> 29:00.071
Do you know
how much they're worth?

29:00.177 --> 29:02.782
A lot. Why?

29:02.791 --> 29:07.010
Oh, I just read
all of his stuff and

29:07.013 --> 29:10.010
hoped to, you know,
own one one day.

29:10.177 --> 29:11.306
Uh-huh.

29:12.106 --> 29:14.302
Oh, it's hard to say.

29:14.302 --> 29:16.853
Usually when a guy
like Rothstein dies,

29:16.853 --> 29:19.528
the value of his first
editions goes through the roof.

29:19.520 --> 29:22.435
I mean, it's not like
he's going to make more.

29:24.222 --> 29:27.333
Mm, it depends on the book's
condition, of course, but

29:27.342 --> 29:32.900
high end, we're talking $100,000,

29:32.915 --> 29:34.853
maybe more.

29:34.951 --> 29:36.657
$100,000?

29:40.410 --> 29:43.380
What about something else, like,

29:43.380 --> 29:45.280
I don't know, his autograph?

29:45.280 --> 29:47.973
Yeah, I've sold a few of those.

29:48.000 --> 29:51.013
If it's just his signature,
maybe a few thousand bucks,

29:51.013 --> 29:55.111
but if it's on a letter
 he wrote, something original,

29:55.493 --> 29:58.266
could be worth more than
the first editions, even.

29:58.260 --> 29:59.457
How much more?

29:59.493 --> 30:01.730
Hundreds of thousands at least.

30:01.800 --> 30:03.200
And that's for a one-pager.

30:03.200 --> 30:06.284
If it's a long letter
about something,

30:06.284 --> 30:08.568
could be worth
a million at least.

30:09.635 --> 30:13.310
I like to see young people
getting into literature.

30:13.368 --> 30:14.755
Tell you what.

30:15.582 --> 30:18.782
Let me see if I can find
something in your range.

30:18.782 --> 30:21.786
Got all sorts
of contacts out there.

30:21.786 --> 30:25.733
You leave me your telephone
number, your email, I'll--

30:25.733 --> 30:28.660
Oh, I'm, 
I just realised I'm late for something.

30:28.660 --> 30:30.844
I'll be back later.

30:33.048 --> 30:35.413
You didn't get his name?

30:35.700 --> 30:37.751
What else did he say?

30:37.777 --> 30:41.360
No, exactly, Andrew.
What did the kid say?

30:42.204 --> 30:45.110
You know what?
Actually, buddy, I'm going to call you back.

30:47.191 --> 30:48.720
What's going on?

30:48.835 --> 30:50.604
Nothing.

30:50.950 --> 30:52.844
Sounds like a pretty
big deal for nothing.

30:52.906 --> 30:55.911
Just work shit.

30:55.964 --> 30:57.490
Work shit?

30:58.844 --> 31:04.391
Landscape work shit or Route
Six real estate work shit?

31:04.435 --> 31:08.231
Danielle, I really need you...

31:08.471 --> 31:11.484
I really need you to stop
breaking my balls.

31:12.940 --> 31:14.710
OK.

31:15.093 --> 31:16.910
I'm done breaking
your balls, Morris.

31:21.137 --> 31:22.950
Can we talk about this?

31:23.102 --> 31:24.968
And you think, like,

31:24.960 --> 31:26.702
talking about it 
is going to make

31:26.702 --> 31:30.524
me OK with you banging this
sick old lady you've been

31:30.520 --> 31:32.568
- fucking since you were 13, 
- Danielle.

31:32.560 --> 31:35.520
who you've continued to fuck
during our relationship?

31:35.528 --> 31:37.330
I promised myself
I'd sleep on it,

31:37.342 --> 31:39.270
that I'd absorb it all
and not act rash.

31:39.271 --> 31:41.848
So here it is fully absorbed.

31:41.884 --> 31:44.942
I'm going to go to work,
and then I'm going to come back

31:44.951 --> 31:47.920
and I'm going to get all my
stuff, because I am done.

31:48.310 --> 31:50.426
Hey.

31:50.480 --> 31:52.195
You cannot just walk out!

31:52.250 --> 31:54.186
Get your fucking hands
off of me.

31:54.180 --> 31:55.350
Danielle.

31:57.262 --> 32:02.090
Remove your fucking hands.

32:20.408 --> 32:21.810
Fuck!

32:29.573 --> 32:32.666
Rothstein listed these as tax records.

32:32.684 --> 32:34.240
OK.

32:34.640 --> 32:38.373
Floppy disks.
Yeah, I read about these.

32:38.373 --> 32:40.730
I mean, do you even have a
computer that can read these?

32:40.730 --> 32:43.502
Believe it or not, we do.

33:10.515 --> 33:11.911
Whoa.

33:12.026 --> 33:14.177
So what exactly am I looking at?

33:14.231 --> 33:16.860
Well, according
to the library catalogue,

33:16.862 --> 33:20.008
these are Rothstein's
tax returns.

33:21.280 --> 33:25.253
But he kept these photos
hidden in a subfile.

33:27.848 --> 33:29.733
What are these, like,

33:29.742 --> 33:32.302
he kept files on the women
he slept with or something?

33:32.364 --> 33:33.813
The guy was a perv,

33:33.813 --> 33:36.790
which makes sense because
Jimmy Gold was a misogynistic perv.

33:36.960 --> 33:39.386
Mm, yeah, in the beginning,
but he grew up.

33:39.422 --> 33:40.960
Gold grew up.

33:40.960 --> 33:42.497
Rothstein didn't.

33:43.200 --> 33:46.924
Well, you can't judge the art
by the artist, though, you know?

33:46.924 --> 33:49.040
I mean, hate the man,
but don't throw out the work.

33:49.048 --> 33:50.670
Caravaggio killed people.

33:50.670 --> 33:52.720
Cellini was a rapist.

33:52.720 --> 33:53.928
Listen, I have something else.

33:54.400 --> 33:55.813
Yeah?

33:56.240 --> 33:58.773
And it hits a little
closer to home.

33:58.980 --> 34:00.560
How do you mean?

34:06.417 --> 34:07.955
That woman.

34:07.955 --> 34:10.097
Blow those up.

34:18.141 --> 34:20.373
Ida.

34:23.929 --> 34:25.447
Wow.

34:27.306 --> 34:29.262
There's no reason to be nervous.

34:30.453 --> 34:32.533
About to get my head examined.

34:32.542 --> 34:34.933
Makes me a little nervous.

34:34.933 --> 34:36.750
- Wouldn't it you? 
- Fair enough.

34:40.551 --> 34:42.871
- No.
- I beg your pardon?

34:42.906 --> 34:46.106
It's not fair enough.
It's not fair at all.

34:46.141 --> 34:48.480
Brady Hartsfield
killed a lot of people.

34:48.533 --> 34:51.181
And he would have continued to
do so had I not stopped him.

34:51.199 --> 34:54.043
OK, what we're doing today
isn't about Brady Hartsfield.

34:54.080 --> 34:57.795
Everything is about Brady.

34:57.813 --> 34:59.226
Well, whether that may be true,

34:59.235 --> 35:01.351
this is about
how we move forward.

35:01.351 --> 35:04.631
This examination does not
concern your mental capacity 

35:04.630 --> 35:05.822
at the time of the shooting.

35:05.840 --> 35:08.711
Rather, I'm only interested
in your current state of mind

35:08.728 --> 35:12.693
and your ability to form
a defence strategy.

35:12.890 --> 35:15.528
Do you have any experience
with the legal system?

35:15.760 --> 35:20.275
Yeah, my experience
is that it doesn't work.

35:20.430 --> 35:23.511
OK. Could you elaborate on that?

35:24.500 --> 35:29.173
Well, not to dwell on Brady, which, 

35:29.173 --> 35:32.510
you say this has
nothing to do with,

35:33.591 --> 35:36.435
he killed many,

35:37.128 --> 35:39.448
he was finally caught,

35:39.448 --> 35:41.528
and instead of seeking retribution,

35:41.528 --> 35:44.853
the federal government
filed a habeas corpus

35:44.862 --> 35:47.120
to gain custody

35:47.164 --> 35:49.662
and study his brain

35:49.662 --> 35:53.262
for the betterment
of all mankind.

35:53.600 --> 35:57.617
When the law sees in a serial
killer a windfall for society,

35:57.617 --> 35:58.915
that tells me that the law and

35:58.915 --> 36:01.786
the legal system
are a little bit fucked.

36:01.840 --> 36:05.902
My focus right now
is whether you'll be able to

36:05.902 --> 36:08.417
effectively participate
in the system,

36:08.435 --> 36:14.391
whether you'll be able to contribute
meaningfully to your own defence.

36:15.220 --> 36:16.533
Lou.

36:28.373 --> 36:29.697
Are you OK?

36:29.733 --> 36:30.551
Yeah.

36:30.551 --> 36:33.910
I'm just processing that question.

36:33.911 --> 36:36.080
It's a good question.

36:36.293 --> 36:41.950
I can contribute to my
own defence because I....

36:43.093 --> 36:46.088
I'm on my own, so I must.

37:04.800 --> 37:10.110
Oh, Jesus! Oh!

37:11.377 --> 37:14.542
You just like to show up
unannounced, don't you?

37:14.568 --> 37:17.120
Since he was 13?

37:17.182 --> 37:19.395
13 years old?

37:19.422 --> 37:21.690
He was strapping,
if that matters.

37:21.742 --> 37:25.351
Look, honey,
you can't take it personally.

37:25.386 --> 37:26.720
No, I can't take it personally

37:26.728 --> 37:29.130
when you're fucking him and he
doesn't even want to fuck you back?

37:29.130 --> 37:31.700
I'm kind of like that Barry White
song, you know?

37:31.700 --> 37:34.270
The first, the last,
the everything.

37:34.728 --> 37:36.657
You shouldn't be jealous of me

37:36.657 --> 37:38.840
any more than I
can be jealous of you.

37:39.413 --> 37:41.910
He's had other girlfriends.

37:41.970 --> 37:43.964
He always comes back.

37:44.977 --> 37:46.871
You're sick.

37:48.666 --> 37:50.968
We're all sick, I suppose.

37:53.466 --> 37:55.090
Truth is,

37:55.182 --> 37:58.020
I'm kind of doing you a favour.

37:59.288 --> 38:01.288
A favour?

38:01.475 --> 38:05.093
Morris is damaged goods,
Danielle. You know that.

38:05.093 --> 38:08.940
Whoever's with him is going to be on
the receiving end of that damage.

38:09.031 --> 38:12.110
I'm built tough. I can take it.

38:12.204 --> 38:14.088
You're a beautiful girl.

38:14.097 --> 38:17.640
And beautiful young girls
can break free of chains.

38:17.653 --> 38:20.310
Break free of Bridgton, Ohio.

38:21.120 --> 38:25.413
There is nothing here for
you in this godforsaken town.

38:25.520 --> 38:29.644
Go take that pretty smile
and make yourself a real life.

38:29.644 --> 38:32.853
You do not want
to be with Morris.

38:33.680 --> 38:36.360
Why should I believe
anything you say?

38:36.577 --> 38:40.106
Because I was once your age

38:40.275 --> 38:45.010
and I was beautiful like you.

38:45.831 --> 38:50.942
And I thought I could make
my dreams come true here,

38:50.977 --> 38:53.528
and so I stayed.

38:53.653 --> 38:56.542
And look at me now.

38:56.577 --> 38:59.146
Go have a life, Danielle.

39:04.337 --> 39:08.951
Looks like you're making a
pretty good life for yourself.

39:09.111 --> 39:13.140
Got a man, nice house,

39:13.715 --> 39:19.200
with good artwork, especially
the artwork in this living room. Oh my God.

39:19.342 --> 39:22.435
The paintings, the drawings,

39:22.444 --> 39:25.368
the photos of houses.

39:25.360 --> 39:27.555
You know,
people who live off Route Six

39:27.555 --> 39:29.804
where a car crash happened,

39:29.804 --> 39:31.484
where they found a dead guy who 

39:31.484 --> 39:34.444
they now think is connected
to John Rothstein's murder.

39:34.666 --> 39:37.290
I mean, if I ever got
a house like this,

39:37.297 --> 39:40.808
that is exactly
how I'd decorate it.

39:41.182 --> 39:44.640
You know, I have never
seen such a pretty room.

39:44.648 --> 39:50.053
I think I'm going to take a picture
of this for Architectural Digest.

39:50.053 --> 39:54.026
You know, I think they'd
really love what you...

40:00.613 --> 40:03.448
It's the way he was acting.
Fishing, you know?

40:03.466 --> 40:07.342
- And how old? 
- Oh, 15, 16, 17.

40:07.342 --> 40:09.390
Hard to tell
with kids these days.

40:09.422 --> 40:10.835
And you got his picture?

40:10.862 --> 40:12.497
I'm getting it right now.

40:14.053 --> 40:17.786
And here he is. That's him.

40:17.866 --> 40:19.810
Can you blow that up some?

40:20.053 --> 40:22.870
A little. Not a lot.

40:24.640 --> 40:26.800
- I want the face.
- Yeah.

40:26.817 --> 40:29.100
That's the best I can do.

40:31.111 --> 40:33.466
And he was asking
specifically about Rothstein?

40:33.493 --> 40:35.960
Specifically and only.

40:36.560 --> 40:40.506
And by the way,
not the only one.

40:40.524 --> 40:41.800
What?

40:41.800 --> 40:43.900
Somebody else came in looking,

40:43.902 --> 40:45.840
asking about Rothstein.

40:45.870 --> 40:46.870
Who?

40:48.595 --> 40:50.140
Hold on.

40:56.186 --> 40:59.150
- He looks familiar. 
- He should.

40:59.911 --> 41:03.420
That's the detective who broke
the Mr Mercedes case.

41:06.684 --> 41:08.835
And what's your
connection, Morris?

41:08.880 --> 41:11.902
- My connection? 
- Yeah.

41:11.955 --> 41:15.260
Everybody wants to know about
Rothstein, including you.

41:16.346 --> 41:18.737
'Cause the worth of his books
is only going to go up.

41:18.737 --> 41:21.297
So if people came in with them,

41:21.333 --> 41:23.146
I want to know.

41:23.191 --> 41:25.070
- As a buyer.
- Uh-huh.

41:25.306 --> 41:27.377
And where would
you get the money

41:27.377 --> 41:29.502
to buy a Rothstein book?

41:30.488 --> 41:32.391
Wherever I need to.

41:32.820 --> 41:34.142
OK.

41:34.195 --> 41:37.040
- Keep in touch, man. 
- I will.

41:42.930 --> 41:45.128
Is this going to become public?

41:45.191 --> 41:47.075
Shouldn't need to.

41:47.200 --> 41:50.337
Oh, my God. My son.

41:50.888 --> 41:53.740
Oh God.

41:54.817 --> 41:56.510
Oh!

41:59.102 --> 42:02.382
Is there any reason
that you didn't tell me?

42:02.835 --> 42:05.620
Well, I...
'Cause I was embarrassed.

42:10.471 --> 42:12.088
Come on, Ida.

42:15.840 --> 42:18.300
30-odd years ago.

42:19.715 --> 42:21.870
Yeah.

42:21.982 --> 42:27.404
Well, I was married
to a very good man.

42:29.111 --> 42:31.262
Oh.

42:31.324 --> 42:34.284
You know, more than
any other thing for me,

42:34.302 --> 42:38.280
my self-esteem is all bound
up in my being honest,

42:38.284 --> 42:40.106
my being loyal.

42:41.537 --> 42:43.960
I was neither.

42:47.386 --> 42:49.795
I'm just so ashamed.

42:49.928 --> 42:54.204
I've never known you and shame
to have much of a dialogue.

42:55.555 --> 42:58.240
He was an adventure ride.

42:58.373 --> 43:01.395
No, I've never been one to,

43:01.502 --> 43:04.071
oh, dwell
on the meaning of life.

43:04.880 --> 43:07.750
For me, it was always more
about experiencing life.

43:07.964 --> 43:10.311
And with John Rothstein,

43:10.311 --> 43:14.862
I just felt so alive.

43:14.942 --> 43:19.946
In bed, sitting at a table
over a glass of whiskey,

43:19.946 --> 43:22.186
or a cup of coffee.

43:22.257 --> 43:26.270
And his mind, my God,

43:26.995 --> 43:29.240
the man's mind.

43:29.448 --> 43:32.417
When he broke it off with me,

43:32.488 --> 43:37.540
that was the most insane
pain I've ever known.

43:37.555 --> 43:39.733
And it was made worse
by the fact that I

43:39.733 --> 43:42.151
couldn't tell anyone about it.

43:42.204 --> 43:44.490
So I just had to, oh,

43:46.408 --> 43:49.120
go through it on my own.

43:54.968 --> 43:58.070
How many pictures
are we talking about?

43:58.622 --> 44:00.497
A few.

44:00.631 --> 44:02.500
Could I get copies?

44:02.702 --> 44:04.910
I'll work on it.

44:06.497 --> 44:10.950
You looked
quite beautiful in them.

44:11.262 --> 44:15.120
I felt quite beautiful
when they were taken.

44:15.706 --> 44:17.964
We need to go to a pub.

44:18.133 --> 44:18.951
What?

44:18.986 --> 44:20.968
In Ireland, if you lose
the love of your life,

44:20.960 --> 44:22.648
you have to have
a proper commemoration.

44:22.648 --> 44:24.346
It can only happen
in a pub. Come on.

44:24.355 --> 44:26.053
Get your dancing shoes on.

44:26.071 --> 44:28.115
Oh, my God.

44:28.115 --> 44:30.684
I feel like such a fool.

44:30.684 --> 44:33.635
Well, you don't look
like one. Let's go.

44:33.715 --> 44:35.110
A date?

44:35.110 --> 44:38.180
Yeah, well, I mean,
it was just for breakfast, but...

44:38.180 --> 44:39.780
But you think it's a date?

44:39.840 --> 44:42.551
Jerome, when a man asks
a woman out for pancakes,

44:42.550 --> 44:44.915
it is rarely about the pancakes.

44:44.915 --> 44:45.893
Mmm.

44:45.946 --> 44:49.404
Not that I've ever been to
pancakes with a man before, but....

44:49.466 --> 44:51.653
OK, do you think this is
a good thing or a bad thing?

44:51.671 --> 44:54.330
It's a bad thing.
It's a terrible thing.

44:54.471 --> 44:56.311
- I think. 
- Why?

44:56.364 --> 44:58.168
I mean, you said he
seems like a good guy.

44:58.195 --> 45:00.408
Yeah, I know.
Well, that might be a problem 'cause...

45:00.408 --> 45:02.560
I might like him
and he might like me and

45:02.568 --> 45:04.088
you know, when
two people like each other,

45:04.088 --> 45:06.426
then they go on another date
and then another date,

45:06.426 --> 45:08.640
and then expectations
come into play, you know,

45:08.648 --> 45:12.180
expectations that
I'm not equipped to fulfil.

45:13.306 --> 45:15.120
- It's him.
- Finkelstein?

45:15.128 --> 45:16.497
Yeah. What do I do?

45:16.524 --> 45:18.604
- Pick it up. 
- No, I can't pick it up.

45:18.657 --> 45:20.284
Holly, pick it up.

45:21.271 --> 45:23.360
OK.

45:25.484 --> 45:27.690
Hello, this is Holly Gibney.

45:27.730 --> 45:28.730
That's...

45:31.404 --> 45:32.670
Really?

45:34.488 --> 45:38.540
Oh, my Go... OK, thank you.
OK, bye.

45:39.333 --> 45:41.911
Lou passed her competency exam.

45:41.980 --> 45:43.528
-  What? 
- Yeah.

45:43.546 --> 45:46.133
She's going to trial.

45:53.290 --> 45:56.080
- What are you doing?
- Just reading.

45:56.260 --> 45:58.730
- That old notebook again?
- Yeah.

45:58.737 --> 46:00.328
Pete, come on, man.

46:00.373 --> 46:03.235
What are you keeping from us?

46:03.271 --> 46:04.506
Nothing.

46:06.230 --> 46:07.530
Nothing?

46:09.740 --> 46:11.310
You know, the thing
about the truth, Pete,

46:12.204 --> 46:15.262
is that it always comes out.

46:36.770 --> 46:38.844
You're being way
too hard on yourself.

46:38.862 --> 46:40.675
I don't think so.

46:42.924 --> 46:45.911
Look, I have to think,
of all the sins in life,

46:45.955 --> 46:48.284
falling in love or maybe
even discovering love,

46:48.337 --> 46:51.235
that's got to be one
of the better ones.

46:52.620 --> 46:55.573
I'm just especially embarrassed

46:55.573 --> 46:57.031
that you all know about it.

46:57.990 --> 46:59.297
Because?

46:59.306 --> 47:01.564
Because to be seen 
through the eyes of 

47:01.564 --> 47:03.448
someone you admire as a 

47:04.328 --> 47:06.915
person who would....

47:11.048 --> 47:14.186
Well, I'll bet
that you are not guilty

47:14.186 --> 47:16.270
of an infidelity with Donna.

47:16.410 --> 47:17.980
Infidelity, no,

47:17.982 --> 47:21.200
but indifference,
which, truth be told,

47:21.208 --> 47:24.426
might be a bigger betrayal.

47:25.555 --> 47:27.990
I was never there.
I was never around,

47:27.990 --> 47:31.182
not enough, you know?

47:35.130 --> 47:42.071
Well, if he saved his correspondence,
including his hate mail,

47:42.080 --> 47:45.940
you might discover
a few letters from me.

47:46.000 --> 47:51.048
I wield a pretty powerful
pen when I'm angry or hurt.

47:51.120 --> 47:54.328
And he did hurt me.

48:00.690 --> 48:02.808
God, you really loved him.

48:05.120 --> 48:08.284
He wasn't worthy of it.

48:15.440 --> 48:17.226
Maybe he was.

48:17.400 --> 48:19.022
Thank you guys.

48:19.022 --> 48:22.924
Going to take a short 15-minute
break for you. Thank you.

48:29.020 --> 48:30.951
Ida, somebody
way smarter than me

48:30.951 --> 48:33.662
said that we regret more the things
we didn't do

48:33.662 --> 48:36.460
-  than the ones we did.
- Oscar Wilde.

48:36.551 --> 48:38.728
Don't tell me you shagged him as
well, did you?

48:41.075 --> 48:43.360
You. Well, he's another Irishman.

48:47.330 --> 48:48.817
Right.

48:48.871 --> 48:50.435
Where you going?

48:51.710 --> 48:53.991
Well,

48:54.373 --> 48:57.253
a commemoration isn't
complete with whiskey.

48:57.288 --> 48:58.497
Need to make it official.

48:58.497 --> 49:01.220
At least my mother used to say
we did anyway, so here we go.

49:10.097 --> 49:13.226
I'm not sure if it's
open mic night but

49:13.226 --> 49:15.448
you'll sure as shit
be wishing it wasn't.

49:15.457 --> 49:21.040
This one is for a friend and for
love, I suppose, or whatever.

49:21.040 --> 49:22.888
Yeah, you can just go
back to your cocktails.

49:22.880 --> 49:23.831
Don't pay me any heed.

49:23.831 --> 49:25.102
This is just between me
and a friend and

49:25.102 --> 49:28.951
it's commemorative,
so you'll just have to fucking endure.

51:50.320 --> 51:52.417
Oh, fuck.

51:55.715 --> 51:58.186
Oh!

52:24.897 --> 52:28.700
Ah!

52:29.964 --> 52:33.911
Ah! Ah!
