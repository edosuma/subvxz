01:15:17.017 --> 01:15:18.602
You forgot this.

01:15:20.771 --> 01:15:22.940
JULIANA: [Whispers] Take it, it's yours.

01:15:23.023 --> 01:15:24.525
I dub thee...

01:15:25.108 --> 01:15:26.610
...Sir Garrett.

01:15:26.693 --> 01:15:28.195
I dub thee...

01:15:28.946 --> 01:15:30.405
...Lady Kayley.

01:15:30.948 --> 01:15:32.908
ARTHUR: Thank you for saving Camelot.

01:15:32.991 --> 01:15:34.993
[Cheering and applause]

01:15:35.869 --> 01:15:38.580
You have reminded us
that a kingdom's strength...

01:15:38.664 --> 01:15:41.124
...is not based on the strength of the king...

01:15:41.208 --> 01:15:43.252
...but the strength of the people.

01:15:43.335 --> 01:15:45.003
From this day forward...

01:15:45.087 --> 01:15:48.340
...you will both sit
as Knights of the Round Table.

01:15:50.092 --> 01:15:52.094
[Cheering and applause]

01:15:57.808 --> 01:15:59.893
[lnstrumental folk music]

01:16:06.775 --> 01:16:09.319
Isn't this everything you've ever wanted?

01:16:09.444 --> 01:16:11.280
Not quite everything.

01:16:20.914 --> 01:16:22.958
Don't even think about it.

01:16:26.587 --> 01:16:28.213
Well done, Ayden.
