00:52.250 --> 00:55.500
SHE'S A PLAYER.
SHE JUST LIKES TO HAVE FUN.

00:55.500 --> 00:57.417
I MET CHRISTINA AT A BAR.

00:57.417 --> 00:58.750
HOT PIECE OF ASS.

00:58.750 --> 01:01.625
TOTALLY HIT IT OFF.
ALL NIGHT LONG WE DANCE,

I BUY HER DRINKS.
AT THE END OF THE NIGHT,

01:04.291 --> 01:06.834
SHE JUST SPLITS.

01:06.834 --> 01:09.125

FOR NOTHING.

01:10.959 --> 01:12.166

SAID SHE'D CALL AND DIDN'T.

MAYBE SHE WANTED TO CALL
AND THAT'S WHY SHE
SAID SHE WAS GONNA CALL,

13:00.125 --> 13:02.834
ALL BAH-JIGGITY
ABOUT SOME GUY.

13:02.834 --> 13:04.667
-YOU'RE CALLING ME
"BAH-JIGGITY?" -YEAH.

13:04.667 --> 13:07.917
-I'M REALLY SORRY.
I DIDN'T MEAN TO STARE.

13:07.917 --> 13:09.250
THAT'S WHY I GOT 'EM.

13:09.250 --> 13:10.375
I'M NOT BAH-JIGGITY.

FEELS REAL, HUH?

13:21.542 --> 13:23.625
IF I'M BAH-JIGGITY

13:30.458 --> 13:31.542
YOU JUST CALLED HIM PETER.

13:31.542 --> 13:33.000

13:51.500 --> 13:55.750
CHRIS, IT'S SO OBVIOUS THAT
YOU LIKE THIS GUY. WHY ARE YOU
BEING SUCH A PUSSY ABOUT IT?

13:55.750 --> 13:59.083

OKAY, NOW ON TODAY'S
FIELD TRIP,

24:59.417 --> 25:02.250
WE ARE GOING TO LEARN
ABOUT CLEANLINESS.

25:04.834 --> 25:07.125
JANE?

25:07.125 --> 25:09.291
JANE BURNS!
HEY.

25:09.291 --> 25:11.917
OH, SWEETHEART,
I HAVEN'T SEEN YOU
SINCE I TAUGHT YOU

25:11.917 --> 25:13.792
IN THIRD GRADE!

25:17.583 --> 25:22.750
-TOP OF THE MORNING,
MR.
MARTIN. -HELLO, FATHER FLYNN.

25:24.125 --> 25:26.125
AS I LIVE AND BREATHE,
ISN'T IT?

25:26.125 --> 25:28.959
IT IS LITTLE MARY JANE BURNS!

25:28.959 --> 25:32.917
WHAT A COINCIDENCE!
I'M HAVING SUPPER WITH
YOUR PARENTS TONIGHT.

25:32.917 --> 25:36.417
QUITE A STAIN
YOU GOT THERE, LITTLE JANIE.

25:36.417 --> 25:38.083
SO, HOW WAS IT?
WAS IT FUN?

25:38.083 --> 25:42.208
OH, MY GOD. OH, MY GOD.
I CAN'T BELIEVE I
DIDN'T TELL YOU THIS.

25:42.208 --> 25:46.083
APPARENTLY, ONE OF THE GUYS
WHO WAS AT THE PARTY,
LIKE, FLIPPED OUT.

25:46.083 --> 25:49.959
WAS OUT ON THE BALCONY
AND HE WAS SCREAMING
AT THE TOP OF HIS LUNGS,

25:49.959 --> 25:56.250
"CHRISTINA! HAS ANYONE SEEN
MY LITTLE CHRISTINA?"

25:56.250 --> 25:59.625
AND THEN HE JUMPS OFF
THE BALCONY AND HE DIES
BECAUSE YOU'RE A PUSSY.

25:59.625 --> 26:01.834
I DON'T KNOW.
WHY DIDN'T YOU GO?

26:01.834 --> 26:05.291
I WAS GOING TO.
I WAS. I WAS GOING
TO AND THEN I WASN'T.

26:05.291 --> 26:08.792
-THEN I DON'T KNOW. I CALLED
HIM AT THE HOTEL THIS MORNING.
-WAIT. HOLD ON.

26:08.792 --> 26:11.792
REWIND FOR ONE SECOND.
YOU CALLED HIM AT THE HOTEL?

26:12.917 --> 26:14.458
WELL, WHAT DID HE SAY?

26:14.458 --> 26:15.667
NOTHING. HE SAID NOTHING.

26:15.667 --> 26:17.417
OKAY? NOTHING.

26:17.417 --> 26:19.166
WHY?
HE CHECKED OUT ALREADY.

26:19.166 --> 26:22.708
OKAY, LET'S JUST SUM THIS UP
REAL QUICKLY.

26:22.708 --> 26:24.792
IN THE BATHROOM
WE HATE HIM,

26:24.792 --> 26:26.708
YET WE CALL HIM BY NAME.

26:26.708 --> 26:29.083
THEN WE THROW BEER ON HIM.

26:29.083 --> 26:32.667
-THEN WE LAUGH AND WE FLIRT
AND WE DANCED WITH HIM.
-IT WASN'T BEER.

26:32.667 --> 26:34.834
THEN WE CASUALLY CALL HIM
AT THE HOTEL.

26:34.834 --> 26:38.291
-THEN WE OBSESS
ABOUT THE CASUAL CALL.
-OBSESS?

26:38.291 --> 26:41.458
-I'M NOT OBSESSING.
I'M NOT OBSESSING.
-I'M JUST WONDERING.

26:41.458 --> 26:44.291
COULD ALL THIS ERRATIC
BEHAVIOR POSSIBLY BE

26:44.291 --> 26:45.667
BECAUSE THIS GUY DID
GET UNDER YOUR SKIN?

26:45.667 --> 26:47.291
THAT YOU MIGHT
REALLY LIKE HIM?
NO!

26:47.291 --> 26:48.417
NO!

26:48.417 --> 26:49.834
YOU REGRET
NOT GOING TO THIS PARTY

26:49.834 --> 26:51.875
BECAUSE NOW YOU WILL NEVER
KNOW WHAT MIGHT HAVE HAPPENED?

26:51.875 --> 26:54.333
NO, OKAY?
I DON'T REGRET IT.

26:54.333 --> 26:58.834
AND IF I HAD ANY REGRETS,
IT WOULD BE THIS CONVERSATION,
RIGHT NOW, HAVING IT WITH YOU.

26:58.834 --> 27:00.291
CAN WE JUST DROP IT?

27:00.291 --> 27:01.417
OKAY,
I'M SORRY I BROUGHT IT UP.

27:01.417 --> 27:03.458
I WON'T MENTION IT AGAIN.

27:05.583 --> 27:10.542
YOU KNOW, EVEN IF I DID REGRET
NOT GOING TO THE PARTY,

27:10.542 --> 27:13.125
IT'S NOT LIKE I CAN DO
ANYTHING ABOUT IT NOW.

27:13.125 --> 27:17.542
SO, I MEAN, SOMETIMES
YOU JUST HAVE TO...
LET THESE THINGS GO, RIGHT?

27:17.542 --> 27:18.667
EXACTLY.

27:18.667 --> 27:20.083
ALTHOUGH,

27:20.083 --> 27:23.000
IF THERE WAS REGRET, YOU KNOW,

27:23.000 --> 27:28.708
I SUPPOSE THERE'S ALWAYS
JUST SOMETHING YOU
COULD DO ABOUT IT, RIGHT?

27:28.708 --> 27:32.000
LIKE YOU COULD SHOW UP
AT HIS BROTHER'S WEDDING,
'CAUSE IT IS HIS BROTHER.

27:32.000 --> 27:35.208
THAT'S ONLY IF
YOU REGRETTED IT,
WHICH I DON'T REGRET IT.

27:35.208 --> 27:37.291
REALLY.
I JUST DON'T REGRET IT.

27:37.291 --> 27:40.583
REGRETTING IS SUCH A WASTE OF
TIME. IT REALLY IS.
IT'S A WASTE OF TIME.

27:40.583 --> 27:43.375
HONEY, CAN YOU JUST ADMIT
THAT YOU REGRET NOT
GOING TO THIS PARTY?

27:43.375 --> 27:46.041
OKAY, FINE. I REGRET NOT
GOING TO THE PARTY.

27:46.041 --> 27:48.417
I KNOW. I'M LETTING IT GO.
I'M OVER IT. I'M OVER IT.

27:49.708 --> 27:52.667
HI, HONEY. HOW'D IT GO?

27:52.667 --> 27:53.708
FINE. NO PROBLEM.

27:53.708 --> 27:54.667
GOOD.

27:54.667 --> 27:57.625
SO,
DID WE HAVE FUN LAST NIGHT?

27:59.917 --> 28:02.333
YES, I DID. IT WAS GREAT.
YOU GUYS WERE
ABSOLUTELY RIGHT.

28:02.333 --> 28:04.250
A TRANSITION GUY IS JUST
WHAT I NEEDED.

28:04.250 --> 28:07.417
GOOD! SO HOW WAS HE?
WAS HE GOOD?

28:07.417 --> 28:11.000
HE WAS VERY SWEET
AND COMPLIMENTARY.

28:11.000 --> 28:12.959
AND VERY INTO PLEASING
ME FIRST.

28:12.959 --> 28:15.917
SO, HOW WAS GIRTH?

28:15.917 --> 28:17.875
AVERAGE-ISH.

28:17.875 --> 28:22.125
AVERAGE-ISH. THAT'S GOOD.
SO, WHAT DID YOU TELL HIM?

28:22.125 --> 28:23.708
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

28:23.708 --> 28:26.333
WHAT DO WE ALWAYS TELL THEM,
NO MATTER WHAT?

28:26.333 --> 28:27.417
OH.

HE'S MISSING AN EYEBROW

33:11.041 --> 33:13.125

THEY LIVE IS LIKE
SOME SMALL FREAK-ASS TOWN

36:34.458 --> 36:38.625
ABOUT THREE HOURS NORTH, SO
WE HAVE TO GET ON THE ROAD IF
WE'RE GONNA MAKE IT ON TIME.

36:38.625 --> 36:40.417
WHAT?
PETER...

36:40.417 --> 36:43.959
PETER? I'M NOT GOING
TO PETER'S BROTHER'S WEDDING.

36:43.959 --> 36:46.708
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
YESTERDAY YOU SAID
YOU WANTED TO GO.

36:46.708 --> 36:48.041
SO I WENT AND, YOU KNOW...

36:48.041 --> 36:49.542
COURTNEY.

36:49.542 --> 36:50.667
I WAS JOKING.

36:50.667 --> 36:52.125
OH, NO, YOU WEREN'T.

36:52.125 --> 36:55.500
UH, YES, I WAS.

36:55.500 --> 36:59.291
50% OF WHAT PEOPLE SAY
WHEN THEY'RE JOKING IS TRUE.

36:59.291 --> 37:03.291
WHICH MEANS THAT YOU DO
WANNA GO TO THIS WEDDING, BUT
YOU'RE TOO AFRAID TO ADMIT IT.

37:03.291 --> 37:07.291
SO BY MAKING SOME SORT OF JOKE
ABOUT IT, YOU GET TO
SAY WHAT YOU REALLY WANT

37:07.291 --> 37:09.166
WITHOUT BEING VULNERABLE.

37:09.166 --> 37:10.458
RIGHT?

37:10.458 --> 37:11.458
MAYBE.

37:11.458 --> 37:13.458
OKAY, GOOD.

37:13.458 --> 37:15.583
THE WEDDING STARTS AT 5:00.
I REFUSE TO BE LATE.

37:15.583 --> 37:18.166
I WANT YOU TO PUT SOME
CLOTHES ON. NOW. THANK YOU.

37:19.291 --> 37:20.500

01:11:24.417 --> 01:11:29.333
I CAME TO JUST EAT MY COOKIE

01:11:29.333 --> 01:11:33.083
-YOU DIDN'T WANT
TO EAT THE COOKIES?
-NO, NO, NO, NO.

01:11:33.083 --> 01:11:34.667
JUST READ THIS.

01:11:34.667 --> 01:11:37.000

01:11:41.708 --> 01:11:45.792
-OH, CHRISTINA, HONEY,
WE'VE GONE OVER THIS.
-NOT THAT ONE.

01:11:45.792 --> 01:11:48.792
YOU DID NOT KNOW
THE GUY WAS GONNA BE
GETTING MARRIED, ALL RIGHT?

01:11:48.792 --> 01:11:52.333
-IT'S ALL RIGHT. IT JUST
WASN'T POSSIBLE, SWEETIE.
-NOT THAT ONE.

01:11:52.333 --> 01:11:54.375

TALKING ABOUT, "FEAR"?

01:12:01.083 --> 01:12:04.375
