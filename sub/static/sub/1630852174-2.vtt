WEBVTT

00:04.796 --> 00:08.216
All:
Three... Two... One!

00:08.299 --> 00:11.553
Happy New Year!
Woo!

00:11.636 --> 00:13.430
Any resolutions,
Dave-Pierre?

00:13.513 --> 00:15.390
Eh, maybe
get a shrink.
How 'bout you?

00:15.473 --> 00:16.766
I'm gonna stop
eating carbs,

00:16.850 --> 00:17.934
be nicer to my Mom,

00:18.017 --> 00:19.269
become the next
Successor--

00:19.352 --> 00:20.687
My New Year's resolution

00:20.770 --> 00:23.440
is to find out
if those titties
of yours

00:23.523 --> 00:25.608
are as pointy
as your ears.

00:25.692 --> 00:27.235
You know, I'd normally
find that repulsive,

00:27.318 --> 00:29.237
but you're actually
inspiring me to like

00:29.320 --> 00:31.489
make Santa Inc.
safe from predators who

00:31.573 --> 00:33.491
force women to remain
scared and silent,

00:33.575 --> 00:35.326
so... thank you.

00:38.538 --> 00:41.082
(joyful music playing)

00:45.253 --> 00:47.172
(sirens wailing)

00:49.716 --> 00:52.302
Santa:
Timmy the Toy Guy would
also make a decent Successor.

00:52.385 --> 00:54.471
Larson in Chocolate is solid.

00:54.554 --> 00:56.139
Below 85 degrees at least.

00:56.222 --> 00:59.225
And Junior wants to put
his nose in the ring.

00:59.309 --> 01:02.145
-Ha! Nose? Hello?
-(slurping)

01:02.228 --> 01:04.773
I'm droppin' fuckin'
bombs here, c'mon!

01:05.690 --> 01:07.150
You really want me
to stop blowing you

01:07.233 --> 01:09.152
just to acknowledge
that terrible joke?

01:09.235 --> 01:12.113
-I mean, I will.
-Yeah, some sort
of acknowledgment.

01:12.197 --> 01:13.823
(sighs)
Okay.

01:13.907 --> 01:15.575
(laughs)

01:15.658 --> 01:17.076
Ah, hilarious!

01:17.160 --> 01:19.579
Was that really
better than me
sucking your dick?

01:19.662 --> 01:24.417
Ho, ho, ho shit!
Oh, Mrs. Claus.

01:24.501 --> 01:28.671
How awesome would
I be to have chosen
the first Black Successor,

01:28.755 --> 01:31.341
and then, the first
woman Successor?

01:31.424 --> 01:34.844
You know how
firsts of any kind
turn me on.

01:34.928 --> 01:36.346
Candy's a Jew, too.

01:36.429 --> 01:38.723
She checks off two boxes:
woman and Jew.

01:38.807 --> 01:39.974
Holy shit!

01:40.058 --> 01:42.352
Holy shit!
A woman and a Jew?!

01:42.435 --> 01:45.563
I'll go from historic to,
like, fuckin' legendary!

01:45.647 --> 01:47.398
Oh my god! Enough!

01:47.482 --> 01:49.275
Uh, can I ask what
your problem is?

01:49.359 --> 01:51.152
We made
a New Year's Eve
resolution

01:51.236 --> 01:53.947
to improve
our sex life
an hour ago,

01:54.030 --> 01:56.032
and you've already
blown it off.

01:56.115 --> 01:59.160
That's categorically insane.
I just nutted.

01:59.244 --> 02:01.287
-Think we're doin' okay.
-Ugh!

02:01.371 --> 02:04.249
♪ ♪

02:06.876 --> 02:11.005
Ah, the North Pole University
interns on their first day.

02:11.089 --> 02:13.925
Look at those
adorable, excited faces.

02:14.008 --> 02:16.469
-So, who did you assign to me?
-Fat guy in cargo shorts.

02:16.553 --> 02:18.555
Candy:
Why not a fat girl
in cargo shorts?

02:18.638 --> 02:20.348
Assigning you a woman

02:20.431 --> 02:22.517
just because
she's a woman

02:22.600 --> 02:24.227
is mad discriminatory.

02:24.310 --> 02:26.062
Will you relax?
Brent was a man,

02:26.145 --> 02:28.565
and I couldn't
have dreamed of
a better mentor,

02:28.648 --> 02:30.441
up until he abandoned me.

02:30.525 --> 02:31.734
I wonder who's gonna be doing

02:31.818 --> 02:33.736
the State of the Workshop
speech tonight.

02:33.820 --> 02:36.281
I wish it could
be me, but I--

02:36.364 --> 02:38.741
You know, Santa will
probably just step in.

02:38.825 --> 02:40.535
All right, let's do this.

02:40.618 --> 02:42.203
Hello, the future!

02:42.287 --> 02:45.832
-(interns cheering)
-I am Candy Smalls,
acting Head of Operations.

02:45.915 --> 02:47.458
Let me tell you
about myself.

02:47.542 --> 02:50.086
As a kid, I was working
in the candy factory

02:50.169 --> 02:51.754
when Brent discovered me.

02:51.838 --> 02:53.298
He saw my excitement,

02:53.381 --> 02:55.675
how fast my hands
wrapped the mints,

02:55.758 --> 02:58.052
and he taught me
everything he knew.

02:58.136 --> 03:00.889
Today, you are
about to take
a giant step

03:00.972 --> 03:02.348
into your future career.

03:02.432 --> 03:04.767
-And I mean giant.
-(interns laughing)

03:04.851 --> 03:08.438
-So let's get started!
-(cheering)

03:08.521 --> 03:11.190
Ooh, she's good.
I felt that in my gut.

03:11.274 --> 03:12.358
Bravo, Candy!

03:12.442 --> 03:14.944
And welcome, NPU seniors!

03:15.028 --> 03:16.404
My old alma mater.

03:16.487 --> 03:19.032
South Pole U
Football sucks dick!

03:19.115 --> 03:21.409
Go Mighty Mistletoes!

03:22.285 --> 03:26.915
-Good morning, Santa!
-Hello, I am the intern
to you, Candy Smalls.

03:26.998 --> 03:28.625
Uh, my name
is Devin Johnson.

03:28.708 --> 03:30.627
Great to meet ya,
Devin Johnson.

03:30.710 --> 03:32.003
Let's get goin'.
I got a meeting

03:32.086 --> 03:34.130
with the Head of Toys,
and you're comin' with me.

03:34.213 --> 03:35.590
W-With Timmy
the Toy Guy?

03:35.673 --> 03:37.300
The dude who put
the "B" in Furby?

03:37.383 --> 03:38.551
The "X" in Xbox?

03:38.635 --> 03:40.720
The man who said
on May 3, 1978,

03:40.803 --> 03:44.098
"This doll's patch
should be
one of cabbage"?

03:44.182 --> 03:45.266
(shouts):
Let's freakin' go!

03:45.350 --> 03:46.768
I'm about to meet
the most exciting

03:46.851 --> 03:48.186
person who ever lived!

03:48.269 --> 03:52.482
The idea sparked
at the urgent care
waiting room.

03:52.565 --> 03:54.442
I sprained my hand,

03:54.525 --> 03:55.652
it's fine,

03:55.735 --> 03:58.321
and ran into a mole
who had been concussed

03:58.404 --> 03:59.614
-with a mallet.
-Can we just--

03:59.697 --> 04:01.491
He told me that moles' lives

04:01.574 --> 04:04.327
have been destroyed
by the game Whack-A-Mole.

04:04.410 --> 04:05.536
Yes, I've heard this before.

04:05.620 --> 04:07.330
So I thought we could protect

04:07.413 --> 04:09.082
the enchanting species

04:09.165 --> 04:11.501
with our next big Christmas toy,

04:11.584 --> 04:13.628
Smash-A-Sloth.

04:13.711 --> 04:14.963
(game beeping)

04:16.923 --> 04:18.716
There he goes.

04:18.800 --> 04:19.884
I just have a thought.

04:19.968 --> 04:21.344
Never mind,
I'm a loser who sucks.

04:21.427 --> 04:24.013
Stop it!
Tell me what you're thinkin'.

04:24.097 --> 04:25.682
And, you know,
never say "I suck"

04:25.765 --> 04:28.226
before you pitch an idea.
No idea sucks.

04:28.309 --> 04:30.812
Well, I just think
now moles will be safe,

04:30.895 --> 04:32.522
but won't sloths
be terrorized?

04:32.605 --> 04:34.899
Maybe the whack'ed should
be something that deserves it,

04:34.983 --> 04:36.359
like Whack-A-White Supremacist.

04:36.442 --> 04:38.027
(phone ring tone):
It's Santa, yay!

04:38.111 --> 04:39.362
Holy shit fuck.

04:39.445 --> 04:42.365
Santa just texted me
for the first time ever.

04:42.448 --> 04:43.741
He wants to see me.

04:43.825 --> 04:46.703
I should frame this.
No, I should get over there.

04:46.786 --> 04:49.038
All right, good start, Timmy.
Why don't you get going on

04:49.122 --> 04:50.623
the new and improved
Devin angle?

04:50.707 --> 04:53.209
-Okay.
-Oh, wow!

04:54.085 --> 04:58.131
I was sooo into your speech
to the interns, Candy.

04:58.214 --> 05:00.383
Help me!

05:01.009 --> 05:02.468
I was sooo into it.

05:02.552 --> 05:04.637
You inspired
and you entertained,

05:04.721 --> 05:07.056
two very important
Santa qualities.

05:07.140 --> 05:08.683
Did you like when
I held up my shoe?

05:08.766 --> 05:10.059
That was pure improv.

05:10.143 --> 05:12.311
I loved it! I was like,
how-wha-whe-wha-what?

05:12.395 --> 05:13.896
Did she come up
with that last night?

05:13.980 --> 05:16.566
Write it down
and then find
a way to do it?

05:16.649 --> 05:19.235
Blew my fuckin' mind.
That's all I can say.

05:19.318 --> 05:22.905
And that is why
I want you to give

05:22.989 --> 05:24.699
the State of the Workshop
speech tonight.

05:24.782 --> 05:28.911
(screams)
Oh my god!
Ah! So honored.

05:28.995 --> 05:32.248
Just blown away,
but still standing here,
but just blown away.

05:32.331 --> 05:34.584
I took your words
of wanting to be
Successor to heart.

05:34.667 --> 05:38.921
Because I am, in fact,
the coolest, dopest Santa ever.

05:39.005 --> 05:40.465
I'm sorry,
I need to scream more.

05:40.548 --> 05:44.427
(high-pitched screams)
Oh my god! Oh my god!

05:44.510 --> 05:45.636
(screams)

05:45.720 --> 05:46.846
I think it's
exciting, too.

05:46.929 --> 05:48.056
It's great for the Board

05:48.139 --> 05:50.933
to see a woman
take the helm.

05:51.017 --> 05:52.560
Yes, love the optics.

05:52.643 --> 05:54.145
Love that you're hearing me.

05:54.228 --> 05:55.438
Loving everything about this.

05:55.521 --> 05:57.273
I'm, I'm gonna go prepare.

05:57.356 --> 05:59.025
Just do the same thing
Brent did every year.

05:59.108 --> 06:03.279
The Board loves it,
and another friendly
word of advice, Candy,

06:03.362 --> 06:06.449
Don't fuck this up,
or your shot at being Successor

06:06.532 --> 06:08.117
is fucking doomed!

06:08.201 --> 06:09.827
(ominous music playing)

06:09.911 --> 06:12.705
Oh my god, I'm kidding!
Ah! That was so--

06:12.789 --> 06:15.041
You should've
seen your face!
I totally had you.

06:15.124 --> 06:16.250
(nervous laughter)

06:16.334 --> 06:17.752
You've been had, lady.

06:17.835 --> 06:19.629
Anyway, you'll be great.

06:19.712 --> 06:22.340
Get me out of here!

06:23.549 --> 06:25.551
Wow, can you
believe this day?

06:25.635 --> 06:28.096
-Maybe I'm a good luck charm?
-I'm a good luck charm.

06:28.179 --> 06:31.057
Snowflakes are
the rabbit's foot
of the North Pole.

06:31.140 --> 06:33.851
Ooh, somebody's getting
jelly of the new guy.

06:33.935 --> 06:36.562
Don't worry.
I've got enough love
for both of you.

06:36.646 --> 06:40.108
-(Jeremy giggles)
-Okay, cancel my lunch
with Cookie and Goldie.

06:40.191 --> 06:43.611
I need to clear my day,
and prepare for this speech.

06:43.694 --> 06:46.656
Now, let's start
by checking out
Brent's old tapes.

06:46.739 --> 06:49.283
I'm there every year,
but I'm always
behind the scenes.

06:49.367 --> 06:52.203
I'm never up close watching it.

06:52.745 --> 06:55.623
-(audience cheering)
-(pony neighs)

06:58.501 --> 07:00.962
Members of the Board,
Santa Claus,

07:01.045 --> 07:03.172
our beloved press, welcome.

07:03.589 --> 07:05.842
Only 360 days
until Christmas Eve,

07:05.925 --> 07:08.970
and this one
is going to be
better than ever.

07:09.053 --> 07:13.015
Because at Santa Inc.,
the State of the Workshop is

07:13.099 --> 07:16.477
strong as a reindeer's
petrified shit!

07:16.561 --> 07:19.522
So here's some early
presents for all of you!

07:19.605 --> 07:21.941
Woo-hoo!

07:22.024 --> 07:24.861
Yeah, that's for you.
You deserve it. You deserve it.

07:24.944 --> 07:26.028
Open it up!

07:26.112 --> 07:28.239
Jesus, can I really do that?

07:28.322 --> 07:31.284
No, you need
charisma for this.

07:31.367 --> 07:33.744
Like Brent and Santa and me.

07:33.828 --> 07:35.663
Ah! I'm panicking.
Somebody get me

07:35.746 --> 07:38.207
guacamole and chips,
so I can stress eat.

07:38.291 --> 07:40.293
(phone ringing)

07:40.376 --> 07:41.627
Brent?

07:41.711 --> 07:43.379
How's Seattle?
Hope it's not raining,

07:43.462 --> 07:45.089
but I'm sure it is,
so get used to being

07:45.173 --> 07:47.550
slightly wet
all the time,
damp sucka!

07:47.633 --> 07:50.052
You have a right
to be mad at me.
I'm sorry.

07:50.136 --> 07:51.888
(cries)
Why'd you leave me?

07:51.971 --> 07:54.765
It was a last-minute thing.
Okay? I know, I suck.

07:54.849 --> 07:57.560
Yeah, I'll have
the Amazon Prime Rib,
medium rare.

07:57.643 --> 07:58.519
Coming right up.

07:58.603 --> 08:00.229
Anyways, I wanna talk about you,

08:00.313 --> 08:01.355
Lady Ambition.

08:01.439 --> 08:02.648
I heard you put
the Successor feelers

08:02.732 --> 08:03.941
out to Santa,
and you're givin'

08:04.025 --> 08:06.444
the State of the Workshop
speech tonight?

08:06.527 --> 08:07.445
How did you know?

08:07.528 --> 08:08.905
Oh, is Alexa
some kind of like

08:08.988 --> 08:10.948
illegal surveillance device?

08:12.033 --> 08:14.368
Hey, this speech
is major exposure.

08:14.452 --> 08:15.703
Have you watched my old tapes?

08:15.786 --> 08:18.539
Just did and your
razzle-dazzle is insane.

08:18.623 --> 08:20.958
I just... I don't
have that in me.

08:21.042 --> 08:23.669
Oh, fuck off, Candace.
I've seen your karaoke moves.

08:23.753 --> 08:25.254
Prime rib at prime speed.

08:25.338 --> 08:27.423
The dips,
the meaningful
eye contact.

08:27.506 --> 08:30.259
Yeah, I guess my mic skills
have been called magical

08:30.343 --> 08:32.261
by many of all backgrounds.

08:32.345 --> 08:35.890
Just believe in yourself
the way I believe in you.

08:35.973 --> 08:38.142
Say it. Say it. Say it.
Say it. Say it. Say it.

08:38.226 --> 08:39.894
(shouts):
I believe in myself!

08:39.977 --> 08:41.979
(laughs)
Okay, this could work.

08:42.063 --> 08:44.732
And, maybe, I could add my own,
uh, spin to the speech.

08:44.815 --> 08:46.025
You know, butter up
the Board with some

08:46.108 --> 08:48.903
-sexy new innovation talk--
-Ugh, God, no!

08:48.986 --> 08:51.405
Just ride in on the mini pony,
shoot glitter bombs,

08:51.489 --> 08:53.658
say, "Next Christmas
will be the best ever,"

08:53.741 --> 08:55.117
then smother them with swag.

08:55.201 --> 08:56.869
Here comes
the airplane, sir.

08:56.953 --> 08:58.329
Gotta go. Love ya, kid.

09:00.623 --> 09:02.166
A happy Candy means more work.

09:02.250 --> 09:03.751
That is correct, my friend!

09:03.834 --> 09:07.129
Now, fasten your seatbelts!
It's gonna be a hell of a show!

09:07.213 --> 09:09.715
-Ha-cha-cha!
-Yes. Ha-cha-cha!

09:09.799 --> 09:11.300
-Oi.
-C'mon, everyone!

09:11.384 --> 09:12.635
Candy and Devin:
Ha-cha-cha!

09:12.718 --> 09:14.637
Ha-cha-no.

09:15.805 --> 09:17.848
All right, Jeremy,
play the mini pony
one more time.

09:17.932 --> 09:19.934
Then you can finish
filling the swag bags.

09:20.017 --> 09:21.269
No, no more!

09:21.352 --> 09:22.979
I did not write
a college thesis

09:23.062 --> 09:25.022
on racism in
the Bismarck Empire

09:25.106 --> 09:26.482
so I could play
a mini pony.

09:26.565 --> 09:27.733
I'll be the pony.
Of course, I'll be--

09:27.817 --> 09:29.068
It's an honor to be the pony,

09:29.151 --> 09:30.611
and really just
to be in this room.

09:30.695 --> 09:32.363
And I wanna hear
more about Brent, too.

09:32.446 --> 09:35.533
His efficiency is
the stuff of legends.

09:35.616 --> 09:37.410
I know.
Every year when
Brent was in charge,

09:37.493 --> 09:40.663
the sled went
.6% faster than
the year before.

09:40.746 --> 09:43.666
Guess who finally banged
Donner last night?

09:43.749 --> 09:45.835
Not y'all! Holla!

09:45.918 --> 09:48.004
Goldie, I thought we
canceled our lunch.

09:48.087 --> 09:51.757
Oh, hello there.
I love me a lumber-jock
in cargo shorts.

09:51.841 --> 09:53.843
What is your name, sweetie?

09:54.260 --> 09:56.262
The streets call me Devin...

09:56.804 --> 09:58.681
but you can
call me Baby.

09:58.764 --> 10:01.183
Girl, look what I stole
from under Donner's bed.

10:01.267 --> 10:02.810
Devin:
Christmas Spirit bars?

10:02.893 --> 10:05.730
Those are only for
the reindeer A-Team.
Very, very rare.

10:05.813 --> 10:08.357
I know.
I had one this morning,
and they're good as fuck.

10:08.441 --> 10:09.692
But I'm gonna
sell the rest

10:09.775 --> 10:11.027

insurance sucks.

10:11.110 --> 10:12.361
Oh shit!
This is my song!

10:12.445 --> 10:15.197
-What song?
-The beat of the Tejano music.

10:15.281 --> 10:17.908
(sings)
Tejano-jano-jano music.

10:17.992 --> 10:21.120

-Come here, baby!

10:22.788 --> 10:25.207
Okay, no stripping

10:25.291 --> 10:27.752

all up on my body.

some air, Goldie.

10:30.129 --> 10:32.173

18:26.522 --> 18:27.523
Now after
the glitter bombs,

18:27.606 --> 18:29.566
Devin and I will
wheel out the swag--

18:29.650 --> 18:30.734
The plan's changed.

18:30.818 --> 18:32.444
I don't need
to throw glitter bombs,

18:32.528 --> 18:34.905
or ride in on some
dumb mini pony.

18:34.988 --> 18:37.616
I happen to have
a PhD, Madam!

18:37.699 --> 18:40.577
-But Brent always--
-Brent was Brent,
and I am me.

18:40.661 --> 18:41.954
Donate all
the swag bags to

18:42.037 --> 18:44.081
the Home for Retired
Elf Coal Miners.

18:44.164 --> 18:46.291
I need to do
this my way.

18:47.084 --> 18:49.378
-(audience cheering)
-Woo!

18:52.756 --> 18:57.052
Everyone!
Welcome to our esteemed
Board Members of Santa Inc.,

18:57.135 --> 19:00.764
to Santa Claus,
members of the press,
and special guests,

19:00.848 --> 19:04.518
and a spy from President's Day!
Security, please remove him.

19:04.601 --> 19:07.396
I am Candy Smalls,
and this is the annual

19:07.479 --> 19:09.398
State of the Workshop.

19:12.484 --> 19:16.405
Now I wanted a chance to talk
about the future of Santa Inc.,

19:16.488 --> 19:18.574
and the changes
that need to be made.

19:18.657 --> 19:21.076
It was Santa Claus
the Fifth who wrote,

19:21.159 --> 19:24.079
"Do one thing every day
that scares you."

19:24.163 --> 19:26.707
I couldn't agree more
because change is hard,

19:26.790 --> 19:29.918
but we can do it
in an honest
and efficient way...

19:30.002 --> 19:33.088
Our reindeer are
strong and capable.

19:33.172 --> 19:35.424
With the help
of auto-reindeer
on the sleigh,

19:35.507 --> 19:39.052
and the use
of B-Team alternates
to prevent burnout,

19:39.136 --> 19:42.931
I am confident we can achieve
record times every year.

19:43.015 --> 19:47.227
One day, one day, one day--

19:48.353 --> 19:49.771
(softly):
Uh, fuck.

19:49.855 --> 19:51.231
Excuse me one minute.

19:51.315 --> 19:52.608
What the fuck?

19:52.691 --> 19:54.192
Fuck me!
The Board is bored.

19:54.276 --> 19:55.444
This is a nightmare.

19:55.527 --> 19:58.780
We need to perk them
up and fast, but how?

19:58.864 --> 19:59.656
(gasps)

20:00.073 --> 20:01.158
Hey, let's give everyone

20:01.241 --> 20:03.118
a little piece
of the Christmas Spirit bars,

20:03.201 --> 20:04.620
just a tiny piece.

20:04.703 --> 20:06.788
Yeah, it'll perk
them up because...

20:06.872 --> 20:09.333
I-- because it's, it's sugar!

20:09.416 --> 20:11.001
All right, good talk.

20:11.084 --> 20:14.671
Okay, some more ideas
to achieve maximum efficiency.

20:14.755 --> 20:17.549
Dismantle the naughty
versus nice system.

20:17.633 --> 20:22.012
Coal is heavy, and makes
the sleigh go .7% slower.

20:22.095 --> 20:25.557
One of the many benefits...
from the coal mine shutdown

20:25.641 --> 20:28.727
can be used on a more
comprehensive health insurance

20:28.810 --> 20:30.812
which will create
happier workers,

20:30.896 --> 20:34.191
and we all know
happier workers
are faster workers.

20:34.274 --> 20:37.194
Healthy efficiency, people.
It's possible.

20:37.277 --> 20:40.030
Just give us our
free shit already, toots!

20:40.113 --> 20:41.865
Me likey swag!

20:41.949 --> 20:43.200
Oh, no swag bags this year.

20:43.283 --> 20:45.118
They're too crass
and materialistic.

20:45.202 --> 20:47.913
(shouts):
So is Christmas,
you asshole!

20:47.996 --> 20:49.164
Boring!

20:49.247 --> 20:50.666
Board Member:
Shut your lady face!

20:50.749 --> 20:52.960
Jeremy:
Everyone, look up here!

20:53.043 --> 20:54.169
She needs a diversion.

20:54.252 --> 20:56.004
Jeremy to the rescue!

20:56.088 --> 20:57.673
Float, float, float.

20:58.465 --> 21:00.175
Somebody has a gun!

21:00.259 --> 21:02.844
(all shouting)

21:04.054 --> 21:05.514
That did not go as planned.

21:07.516 --> 21:09.101
(car alarm blaring)

21:09.184 --> 21:11.603
-Ah!
-(commotion)

21:11.687 --> 21:13.480
(neighing)

21:16.233 --> 21:18.151
Jesus! This is
a fucking coup!

21:18.235 --> 21:19.861
Why didn't you just
follow Brent's playbook?

21:19.945 --> 21:21.405
Seriously? Seriously?

21:21.488 --> 21:25.492
This was your shot
to impress the Board,
and you fuckin' blew it.

21:25.575 --> 21:28.161
I am not Brent,
and if you want to
know the truth Santa,

21:28.245 --> 21:32.040
Brent wasn't...
Brent... Brent wasn't--

21:32.124 --> 21:34.418
He wasn't what?!
Speak!

21:34.501 --> 21:38.463
-Honestly, you bored
the fuck out of everyone.
-Ahh!

21:38.547 --> 21:41.341
I thought you had
the entertainer bug in you.
It doesn't matter.

21:41.425 --> 21:43.760
It's so key
to being a Successor,
and you don't have it.

21:43.844 --> 21:45.721
Ugh, well then maybe
you should witness

21:45.804 --> 21:48.056
my karaoke skills, bitch!

21:48.140 --> 21:49.558
I'm sorry.
I just think there
needs to be

21:49.641 --> 21:51.560
some changes
around here.
Like now.

21:51.643 --> 21:53.228
Don't talk to me
about change.

21:53.311 --> 21:56.940
I chose the first
Black Successor.
Capital "B."

21:57.024 --> 21:59.651
Now that was some change
you can fuckin' believe in.

21:59.735 --> 22:00.736
Well done, Candy.

22:00.819 --> 22:02.237
I always thought
Brent's addresses

22:02.320 --> 22:04.406
were more like
trips to the circus.

22:04.489 --> 22:07.117
While yours was like
a Holocaust documentary.

22:07.200 --> 22:09.786
You had my heart
and my head.

22:09.870 --> 22:11.329
That was exactly
what I was going for.

22:11.413 --> 22:13.290
I feel like you get me,
like if you wanted to get--

22:13.373 --> 22:14.583
I would love to get
coffee with you,

22:14.666 --> 22:15.792
or just pick your brain.

22:15.876 --> 22:17.544
(blows raspberry)
All right, that's it.

22:17.627 --> 22:18.587
Let's go.

22:18.670 --> 22:20.756
Jingle Jim:
I'm gonna melt ya down,

22:20.839 --> 22:25.302
drink ya like a shot of vodka,
and piss you into the gutter!

22:27.054 --> 22:28.180
Cookie:
There you are.

22:28.555 --> 22:31.099
Ugh, I fucking blew it, Cookie.

22:31.183 --> 22:33.518
-Now what am I gonna do?
-Cookie: The obvious.

22:33.602 --> 22:37.314
Get black-out drunk,
and show the world what
you're really made of.

22:39.608 --> 22:43.028
