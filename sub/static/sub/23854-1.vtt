00:25.240 --> 00:27.999
Hello, and welcome to Top Gear.

00:28.000 --> 00:30.639
Thank you! Thank you, thank you,
thank you...

00:30.640 --> 00:32.799
And thank YOU in particular, yes.

00:32.800 --> 00:34.039
All right, we are back

00:34.040 --> 00:36.079
and we have been busy driving
a whole lot of cars.

00:36.080 --> 00:38.880
Here's what we've got coming up
for you in this series.

00:46.120 --> 00:48.480
Who says we don't do
serious car reviews?

00:51.680 --> 00:52.719
Here!

00:52.720 --> 00:54.560
Noooo!

00:57.720 --> 00:59.520
Whoohoo! How good is that?!

01:01.400 --> 01:03.159
- Scare me! - Scare you?!

01:03.160 --> 01:05.040
- Scare me! - I'm trying!

01:06.840 --> 01:08.960
That's what I'm talking about!

01:12.360 --> 01:13.879
Yahoo!

01:13.880 --> 01:16.039
That, my friend, is panache.

01:24.440 --> 01:26.959
Imola!

01:26.960 --> 01:28.400
Incoming car.

01:34.520 --> 01:35.840
Come on!

01:42.600 --> 01:46.319
All that to look forward to
over the next six weeks, OK?

01:46.320 --> 01:47.559
But first up,

01:47.560 --> 01:51.719
you ask any car lover what their
favourite noise in the world is,

01:51.720 --> 01:53.479
and they will immediately say...

01:53.480 --> 01:54.879
The V8 engine.

01:54.880 --> 01:56.079
Exactly.

01:56.080 --> 01:57.959
And with this year being,
as you all know,

01:57.960 --> 02:01.039
the 116th anniversary
of the V8 car...

02:01.040 --> 02:03.199
The big 116!

02:03.200 --> 02:06.239
..we decided it was time
for a little celebration.

02:06.240 --> 02:10.559
Yeah, so the producers told us three
each to pick a new V8 sports car

02:10.560 --> 02:11.799
that could do anything.

02:11.800 --> 02:14.960
And head to America's Wild West
for a mystery road trip.

02:18.520 --> 02:20.719
The United States -

02:20.720 --> 02:25.280
spiritual home of the V8 and land
of the great American road trip.

02:27.160 --> 02:30.199
Ours would begin
at a remote location in Utah,

02:30.200 --> 02:33.959
where we'd been told to show up
with the best all-around sports car

02:33.960 --> 02:37.839
we could find, powered by that most
iconic of all engines.

02:39.080 --> 02:40.360
Yeah, baby.

02:41.480 --> 02:43.879
And since I had the home advantage,

02:43.880 --> 02:47.320
I took the producer's brief and...
well, I nailed it.

02:52.240 --> 02:53.919
The Ford Mustang.

02:53.920 --> 02:59.159
The original American V8
performance icon, huh?

02:59.160 --> 03:01.079
And this isn't just any
Ford Mustang -

03:01.080 --> 03:02.919
no, no, no, no, no, no.

03:02.920 --> 03:07.199
This is the raciest Mustang Ford
makes, the GT350R.

03:07.200 --> 03:12.760
Carbon fibre wheels, a 5.2-litre V8
motor that makes 520 horsepower.

03:14.280 --> 03:16.679
Only this one... doesn't.

03:16.680 --> 03:19.599
Because in the finest Mustang
tradition of taking a fast thing

03:19.600 --> 03:21.359
and making it even faster,

03:21.360 --> 03:24.119
this particular GT350R

03:24.120 --> 03:27.919
has been lightly enhanced
by a man from Texas.

03:27.920 --> 03:31.039
A man called Mr Hennessey.

03:31.040 --> 03:34.080
Oh. Ssh, ssh. OK, here we go.

03:35.600 --> 03:39.319
And while I had embraced the V8
brief and used my imagination...

03:39.320 --> 03:41.079
Oh, yeah! That's right.

03:41.080 --> 03:43.319
..it appeared Rory... hadn't.

03:43.320 --> 03:46.959
The Jaguar F-Type SVR.

03:46.960 --> 03:48.519
- Yeah. - Yeah, isn't this great?

03:48.520 --> 03:52.719
I mean, you brought a V8 muscle car,
I brought a V8 muscle car.

03:52.720 --> 03:54.159
No, no. No.

03:54.160 --> 03:57.999
No, I brought a V8 muscle car,
you brought...

03:58.000 --> 03:59.479
..a Jaguar.

03:59.480 --> 04:01.839
Well, this is Britain's answer
to the muscle car.

04:01.840 --> 04:05.279
We had a look at your rough sketch
and we refined it.

04:05.280 --> 04:07.999
This is muscle car 2.0.

04:08.000 --> 04:09.519
How much power does it make?

04:09.520 --> 04:12.279
575 horsepower.

04:12.280 --> 04:14.519
Wow, impressive! Yeah. Wow!

04:14.520 --> 04:15.959
How about yours?

04:15.960 --> 04:18.759
I don't know, really.
I don't know. Mustang...

04:18.760 --> 04:20.918
What do you mean you don't know?

04:20.920 --> 04:22.319
This is a supercharged version.

04:22.320 --> 04:24.039
Wait a minute -
is this the Hennessey?

04:24.040 --> 04:27.119
- Is it? - This thing makes
850 horsepower!

04:27.120 --> 04:28.359
Does it?!

04:28.360 --> 04:30.239
Ooh!

04:30.240 --> 04:31.360
Lucky me!

04:34.360 --> 04:36.559
Then along came Chris...

04:36.560 --> 04:37.839
Well, well, well.

04:37.840 --> 04:40.639
..with HIS idea of a
great all-rounder.

04:40.640 --> 04:43.799
Absolute shambles.

04:43.800 --> 04:46.719
4 million miles of paved road
in America,

04:46.720 --> 04:49.919
and they tell us to meet
in a pit full of rocks.

04:49.920 --> 04:54.119
Worse still, it sounded like
a 1980s arcade.

04:59.120 --> 05:05.479
Gentlemen! Behold the McLaren 570GT.

05:05.480 --> 05:07.119
How's the, er, ground clearance?

05:07.120 --> 05:08.359
Absolutely terrible.

05:08.360 --> 05:09.679
When they said "road trip,"

05:09.680 --> 05:11.959
I thought it might involve
actual roads.

05:11.960 --> 05:13.399
Chris, this is the Wild West.

05:13.400 --> 05:15.439
You've got to be prepared
for anything!

05:15.440 --> 05:16.799
Well, I suppose I am,

05:16.800 --> 05:19.439
because this is basically two cars
for the price of one, isn't it?

05:19.440 --> 05:23.399
On the one hand, it is still
a proper supercar, crazy fast.

05:23.400 --> 05:25.119
But it's also a comfortable GT car.

05:25.120 --> 05:27.719
In fact it's three cars -
check this out...

05:27.720 --> 05:29.399
It's also an estate car!

05:29.400 --> 05:30.440
Look at this!

05:31.560 --> 05:35.559
Wow. You could seriously fit
a couple of sheets of A4 in there.

05:35.560 --> 05:37.999
And not that flimsy stuff,
I'm talking about the thick...

05:38.000 --> 05:41.319
The stuff you use, like,
for a cover page, the good stuff?

05:41.320 --> 05:45.599
We're supposed to be celebrating the
evolution, OK,

05:45.600 --> 05:47.319
- of the V8 sports car. - Right.

05:47.320 --> 05:50.639
You've brought a car that
desperately wants it to be 1965.

05:50.640 --> 05:52.439
- Yeah. - And you've also brought a car

05:52.440 --> 05:54.559
that desperately wants it
to be 1965.

05:54.560 --> 05:57.039
- So...? - I'm in the present day,
you're in the past,

05:57.040 --> 05:59.199
as is confirmed by your shirt.

05:59.200 --> 06:01.999
Right. What are you laughing at?
Let's not get on shirts!

06:02.000 --> 06:04.399
Let's not get on shirts!

06:04.400 --> 06:06.439
I look good! You do look good.

06:06.440 --> 06:08.519
- You look... You're on fire.
- I've never seen a label

06:08.520 --> 06:09.759
riveted to a T-shirt before.

06:09.760 --> 06:11.559
That's remarkable, that is.

06:11.560 --> 06:14.879
But before we could get to the
bottom of who looked least awful,

06:14.880 --> 06:17.999
a local turned up
in an old Ford pick-up.

06:18.000 --> 06:20.159
Ooh, that sounds a bit V8-y,
what's that?

06:20.160 --> 06:21.839
They do burble nicely, V8s,
don't they?

06:21.840 --> 06:23.079
Burble, burble.

06:23.080 --> 06:24.679
- How are you? - Here you go.

06:24.680 --> 06:27.200
Oh, thank you. Nice ride.

06:30.760 --> 06:34.119
OK. "You and your V8 sports cars
will now drive

06:34.120 --> 06:37.959
"to America's fastest race track
on the Nevada border.

06:37.960 --> 06:40.399
"Along the way, you will undertake
a series of challenges

06:40.400 --> 06:43.520
"to discover which of your V8s
is best."

06:45.600 --> 06:48.999
So, with the Nevada border
a couple of days ahead of us,

06:49.000 --> 06:51.359
we had some road to cover.

06:51.360 --> 06:53.800
But, of course, first,
that meant finding it.

06:59.720 --> 07:03.919
This is the quintessential American
V8 right here, the Mustang.

07:07.000 --> 07:08.200
Oh, yeah!

07:09.880 --> 07:11.599
Buying it is just the start.

07:11.600 --> 07:15.159
Then you get busy giving it more
power, bigger brakes,

07:15.160 --> 07:16.879
probably even more power.

07:16.880 --> 07:18.200
It's the American way!

07:20.400 --> 07:24.639
The 570GT is the most relaxed car
that McLaren makes, right?

07:24.640 --> 07:28.239
It's got softer suspension
and it's quieter on the road -

07:28.240 --> 07:30.439
or at least it would be
if I was on a road!

07:30.440 --> 07:32.640
- Oh!

07:36.040 --> 07:37.159
Oh-ho-ho!

07:38.680 --> 07:43.080
There is a very good reason
why I chose the Jaguar F-Type SVR.

07:44.240 --> 07:46.999
I chose this because it has
all-wheel drive,

07:47.000 --> 07:49.479
and that means it's ready
for anything.

07:49.480 --> 07:51.119
It's unflappable.

07:51.120 --> 07:52.280
Suave.

07:54.280 --> 07:55.480
Like me.

07:57.480 --> 07:59.159
But soon, it was time to find out

07:59.160 --> 08:02.000
just how unflappable
our V8s really were...

08:03.920 --> 08:07.760
..because getting out of this valley
would take a bit of a climb.

08:09.360 --> 08:11.479
This looks like a very bad idea.

08:11.480 --> 08:12.760
Dear Lord!

08:14.680 --> 08:17.239
One mistake up here,
and you're looking at

08:17.240 --> 08:19.320
a very, very painful accident.

08:23.120 --> 08:25.520
Look at the remnants
of that car there!

08:27.920 --> 08:31.640
But none of that seemed to trouble
the cowboy and his Mustang.

08:34.280 --> 08:36.759
Careful, Matt,
what the hell are you doing?!

08:42.760 --> 08:44.759
Coming round the top, boys!

08:44.760 --> 08:46.519
Whoo!

08:46.520 --> 08:47.920
Supposed to be a road trip!

08:49.400 --> 08:51.160
God, look what we've just come up!

08:53.040 --> 08:54.800
That would be a beautiful death!

08:57.360 --> 09:00.759
With the valley behind us,
waiting at the top...

09:00.760 --> 09:03.239
Hey, a paved road! Look at this!

09:03.240 --> 09:05.279
Yes!

09:05.280 --> 09:08.080
Finally, our V8s
could stretch their legs.

09:14.240 --> 09:16.200
This is where the real test begins.

09:18.000 --> 09:19.400
Ho-ho!

09:21.240 --> 09:22.839
Whoo!

09:30.760 --> 09:32.039
Do you hear that, boys?

09:32.040 --> 09:35.599
That is the sound of
an American V8 in the wild -

09:35.600 --> 09:37.240
the greatest noise in the world!

09:40.040 --> 09:42.119
I don't mean to be pernickety here,

09:42.120 --> 09:44.439
but that's not
an American V8, really,

09:44.440 --> 09:47.799
is it, Matt? Because that's
a flat-plane V8 sound,

09:47.800 --> 09:51.399
and most American V8s
are cross-plane V8s,

09:51.400 --> 09:53.879
so what you've got there
is a European V8

09:53.880 --> 09:55.559
in an American body shell.

09:55.560 --> 09:58.760
That's about as American
as Silvio Berlusconi!

10:00.000 --> 10:01.400
Who is she?

10:08.240 --> 10:12.239
This is the coupe version of the car
that I drove from Coventry to Geneva

10:12.240 --> 10:13.679
a couple of years ago.

10:13.680 --> 10:16.839
At the time, I said that was
the fastest Jaguar ever,

10:16.840 --> 10:18.319
but that's not quite true,

10:18.320 --> 10:20.880
because THIS is
the fastest Jag ever.

10:22.760 --> 10:25.039
This will do 200mph.

10:25.040 --> 10:29.759
The fixed roof actually improves
top speed by 5mph.

10:29.760 --> 10:32.159
It's the same reason Chris Harris
is so fast.

10:32.160 --> 10:33.440
It's all down to his dome!

10:35.520 --> 10:38.839
Most supercars, they're a pain
to live with, they really are.

10:38.840 --> 10:41.559
But the 570GT, it just isn't.

10:41.560 --> 10:44.799
This car is supple,
it's comfortable,

10:44.800 --> 10:47.519
it's practical, and on this road...

10:47.520 --> 10:50.720
I'm in the firm suspension setting
now - if I go to comfort...

10:52.200 --> 10:55.480
Oh, yes! Oh, yes!

10:58.600 --> 11:00.000
Whoa!

11:01.960 --> 11:04.319
Oh, that McLaren is quick!

11:04.320 --> 11:06.079
Hey, Chris, what's the 0-60 on that?

11:06.080 --> 11:07.559
About three and a half seconds.

11:07.560 --> 11:09.079
About the same as mine.

11:09.080 --> 11:11.679
Matt? Yeah, about three and a half
seconds maybe.

11:11.680 --> 11:12.959
Maybe less, I don't know,

11:12.960 --> 11:16.719
- right around there. - OK, OK -
how about a shoot-out?

11:16.720 --> 11:20.759
- A what? - Take the next left.
Next left.

11:20.760 --> 11:23.520
And suddenly we were off-road again.

11:24.800 --> 11:26.320
Oh, you're going to love this.

11:27.360 --> 11:29.680
There's nothing about this
I'm going to love.

11:33.440 --> 11:36.199
Right, here's how
this is going to work.

11:36.200 --> 11:38.839
Quickest on the draw,
like in those old cowboy films.

11:38.840 --> 11:41.199
When I say go, you two head off,

11:41.200 --> 11:43.679
opposite directions,
slow as you can,

11:43.680 --> 11:45.439
but no touching the brakes.

11:45.440 --> 11:47.999
When I come on the radio and say
draw,

11:48.000 --> 11:49.919
spin around and head back.

11:49.920 --> 11:52.759
First one across the line
is the winner.

11:52.760 --> 11:54.999
This is completely childish.

11:55.000 --> 11:56.679
You don't have to play.

11:56.680 --> 11:58.079
Oh, I'm going to play.

11:58.080 --> 11:59.600
Yeah, I'm going to win as well.

12:01.160 --> 12:03.040
Buffalo LeBlanc, you ready?

12:04.160 --> 12:05.839
Ready.

12:05.840 --> 12:08.519
Crazy Eyes Harris, are you ready?

12:08.520 --> 12:09.999
Crazy Eyes, who has...?

12:10.000 --> 12:11.960
Stupid nicknames. Yeah, I'm ready!

12:15.880 --> 12:18.399
Three, two...

12:18.400 --> 12:20.279
..one...

12:20.280 --> 12:21.320
Go!

12:23.880 --> 12:25.440
He's not even moving!

12:30.680 --> 12:32.440
Two can play at that game, LeBlanc.

12:34.520 --> 12:36.559
I saw brake lights, Harris.

12:36.560 --> 12:37.800
No brakes.

12:42.080 --> 12:43.279
A duel in the dirt -

12:43.280 --> 12:45.840
this is basically what this car
was designed to do.

12:47.800 --> 12:49.199
He's got a locking differential.

12:49.200 --> 12:51.919
He can turn on a sixpence if he just
does a little half-doughnut,

12:51.920 --> 12:53.040
whereas I can't.

12:54.160 --> 12:57.240
Curse you, McLaren, and your lack
of locking differentials!

12:59.840 --> 13:04.599
V8 muscle car is a tool, as good
or as bad as the man handling it.

13:04.600 --> 13:06.079
Remember that.

13:12.480 --> 13:13.600
Yeah.

13:15.240 --> 13:17.959
I'm going to get over
to one side now.

13:17.960 --> 13:19.599
Wait for it.

13:19.600 --> 13:20.799
Wait for it.

13:20.800 --> 13:23.640
Come on, come on, come on, come on,
say it, say it, say it!

13:28.040 --> 13:29.280
Draw!

13:33.720 --> 13:35.640
Ho-ho!

13:37.600 --> 13:38.880
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

13:42.720 --> 13:44.479
Yes, baby!

13:44.480 --> 13:47.159
- Chris is the winner! - Ha-ha-ha!

13:47.160 --> 13:49.319
Damn it, he got me!

13:49.320 --> 13:51.079
Oh!

13:51.080 --> 13:52.919
- Oh! - Chris has taken it!

13:52.920 --> 13:55.199
Chris, in the McLaren!

13:55.200 --> 13:56.999
Well done, mate.

13:57.000 --> 13:58.399
Thanks for that! Cheers!

14:02.240 --> 14:05.279
So, with the Mustang
out of the game,

14:05.280 --> 14:08.519
would the Jag be any quicker
on the draw?

14:08.520 --> 14:11.359
OK, Crazy Eyes Harris,
are you ready?

14:11.360 --> 14:13.799
- I'm ready. - Rory...

14:13.800 --> 14:16.160
Odd Taste In Clothing -
are you ready?

14:17.720 --> 14:19.399
Never been readier!

14:19.400 --> 14:23.679
Three, two, one...

14:23.680 --> 14:24.960
Go!

14:26.080 --> 14:28.519
OK, we're off.

14:28.520 --> 14:31.479
Oh, he's had to creep away
faster than me.

14:31.480 --> 14:33.839
Man, this is so counterintuitive.

14:33.840 --> 14:37.119
I've got 570-odd horsepower

14:37.120 --> 14:40.040
and I can only use
about three right now!

14:42.000 --> 14:43.320
Who will it be?

14:45.720 --> 14:48.039
Four-wheel drive, a massive
advantage for him

14:48.040 --> 14:51.639
when it comes to heading
back towards the finish line.

14:51.640 --> 14:56.839
But I'm not convinced that he can
turn as well as me,

14:56.840 --> 14:59.719
cos I can spin turn, and he can't.

14:59.720 --> 15:02.160
All right, come on, Reid, come on,
come on, come on.

15:03.640 --> 15:07.519
- He's moving to one side...
- Get ready, get ready, get ready.

15:07.520 --> 15:08.680
And draw!

15:13.600 --> 15:16.080
Come on! Come on, baby!

15:22.280 --> 15:23.599
Made it!

15:23.600 --> 15:24.759
Oh-ho-ho!

15:24.760 --> 15:27.239
Whoo! Come on!

15:27.240 --> 15:29.159
Oh, I think I got duffed up there.

15:29.160 --> 15:30.839
Rory by a mile!

15:30.840 --> 15:32.519
I think, yes, an actual mile!

15:32.520 --> 15:35.160
- Oh! - Ha-ha!

15:37.160 --> 15:41.799
That, gentlemen, is what you call
a spectacular win.

15:41.800 --> 15:45.959
- Here it comes. - I just beat
a McLaren, in a Jag!

15:45.960 --> 15:47.159
I didn't stand a chance.

15:47.160 --> 15:49.559
All-wheel drive Jag -
wasn't going to beat that.

15:49.560 --> 15:50.679
You were gone.

15:52.960 --> 15:54.640
Are you doing the dance IN the car?

15:56.040 --> 15:57.960
Yeah, a little bit. A little bit.

16:01.440 --> 16:04.759
Just to confirm, er,
I'm not done winning.

16:04.760 --> 16:05.800
Right.

16:07.040 --> 16:10.279
So, as Rory took winning the
challenge he'd just made up

16:10.280 --> 16:12.159
with his typical good grace...

16:12.160 --> 16:14.560
Oh, it feels good to be a winner!

16:16.040 --> 16:17.320
..we got back on the road.

16:22.280 --> 16:23.839
The Jaguar F-Type.

16:23.840 --> 16:25.639
Know what that says about you, Rory?

16:25.640 --> 16:27.159
What does it say about me?

16:27.160 --> 16:30.199
- It says you couldn't afford
an Aston Martin. - Oh!

16:31.920 --> 16:34.999
Soon, we were told to head to
a mystery location

16:35.000 --> 16:37.800
for our first proper tribute
to the V8.

16:42.040 --> 16:43.320
What is this place?

16:44.800 --> 16:47.240
I don't know.
But it looks kind of creepy.

16:51.480 --> 16:54.799
- Who's he? - It appears to be
a challenge, gentlemen.

16:54.800 --> 16:56.759
Thank you. It says here,

16:56.760 --> 17:01.559
"The V8 sports car can trace its
roots back to the prohibition era,

17:01.560 --> 17:05.398
"when moonshine runners needed speed
and performance to evade the police.

17:05.400 --> 17:08.079
"To prove the speed and performance
of your V8s,

17:08.079 --> 17:12.400
"you will now each run a crate of
moonshine to the state line."

17:13.920 --> 17:17.679
So, this tribute to the V8 moonshine
runners of old

17:17.680 --> 17:20.919
would be a chase through
a sprawling industrial complex,

17:20.920 --> 17:23.280
finishing at a hastily knocked
together...

17:25.400 --> 17:26.959
..border post.

17:26.960 --> 17:29.159
"PS - get a move on.

17:29.160 --> 17:31.919
"As soon as Officer Block finishes
his doughnut,

17:31.920 --> 17:33.320
"he'll be in hot pursuit."

17:34.360 --> 17:38.039
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
Officer Block?

17:38.040 --> 17:39.240
Ken Block?!

17:41.240 --> 17:44.959
Yes. Because no chase would be
complete without a bit of company,

17:44.960 --> 17:48.999
we'd be pursued by legendary
Sheriff of the Slide,

17:49.000 --> 17:50.359
Ken Block.

17:50.360 --> 17:51.639
My buddy!

17:51.640 --> 17:55.519
Me and Ken, we go way back!
Yeah! K-Dog! K-Money! Big-K...

17:55.520 --> 17:57.759
Special-K is what I call him.

17:57.760 --> 17:59.159
Very heart-warming story, Matt,

17:59.160 --> 18:01.519
but Officer Block appears to have
turned to the dark side.

18:01.520 --> 18:04.279
He's a member of the law now. Let's
load up and get out of here, OK?

18:04.280 --> 18:06.040
- Copy that. - Shine time!

18:08.600 --> 18:09.920
Go, go, go, go, go!

18:11.040 --> 18:13.120
- Are you ready? - Hit it! Go!

18:26.920 --> 18:28.279
Which way are we going?

18:28.280 --> 18:29.320
This is sketchy.

18:31.360 --> 18:32.440
He's coming!

18:34.280 --> 18:36.200
He's right behind you, Rory!

18:39.640 --> 18:41.879
With the pursuit gathering momentum,

18:41.880 --> 18:45.200
it seemed like a good opportunity
to assess our cars' handling.

18:48.760 --> 18:52.479
Ah, this four-wheel drive
is perfect for this!

18:52.480 --> 18:54.079
This thing just grips!

18:54.080 --> 18:57.880
I can throw it into a corner,
get on the power super early...

18:59.080 --> 19:00.640
..and it just goes!

19:03.240 --> 19:05.159
God, this thing is so fast.

19:05.160 --> 19:07.439
But it's small and it's nimble.

19:07.440 --> 19:09.679
That's what McLaren is all
about, it's about handling.

19:09.680 --> 19:11.440
I've got handling to spare here.

19:13.000 --> 19:16.160
One-handage!
One-handed shine escape!

19:21.880 --> 19:23.479
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

19:27.240 --> 19:29.239
It's got so much grip!

19:29.240 --> 19:31.080
And the steering is like a razor.

19:32.440 --> 19:33.640
So aggressive.

19:35.480 --> 19:37.039
OK...

19:37.040 --> 19:39.480
I mean, I don't like running
from the law, but...

19:42.120 --> 19:43.400
..this is awesome!

19:46.400 --> 19:48.080
Whoa!

19:49.120 --> 19:51.679
- Go, Chris - go, go, go!
- He's right behind me!

19:55.480 --> 19:58.839
Man, this guy really
wants my moonshine!

19:58.840 --> 20:00.679
All right, we've got to lose him,
you guys.

20:00.680 --> 20:02.879
We need to split up. Rory,
you go right, we'll go left.

20:02.880 --> 20:05.400
- Go right, go right.
- Good idea, good idea.

20:07.880 --> 20:10.999
No, no, no, no.
Bad idea, bad idea!

20:11.000 --> 20:13.280
How do I get out, how do I get out?

20:14.680 --> 20:15.960
Argh!

20:19.480 --> 20:20.879
Hey, Ken.

20:20.880 --> 20:23.400
You know what rhymes with block?
C...

20:36.240 --> 20:38.680
- Oh-ho-ho...
- Harris, where are you going?

20:49.120 --> 20:51.239
Relentless.

20:53.320 --> 20:54.880
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!

20:56.720 --> 20:57.960
Hey, buddy!

21:02.360 --> 21:03.680
Whoa!

21:04.800 --> 21:06.880
That's not friendly at all.

21:08.520 --> 21:11.040
How far have I got to go?
Where is he?

21:20.680 --> 21:21.800
Oh, my Lord.

21:28.480 --> 21:31.680
He's so much quicker than me.
He can go across the grass, I can't.

21:47.440 --> 21:49.160
Oh, my God!

21:55.240 --> 21:56.840
Oh, ho-ho!

22:02.800 --> 22:04.160
I can see a border!

22:11.000 --> 22:13.200
Oh, it's sketchy,
the tyres are going.

22:15.680 --> 22:18.240
Get through the border,
get through the border...

22:19.240 --> 22:20.720
Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

22:34.080 --> 22:35.999
OK, we'll pick that up
later in the show.

22:36.000 --> 22:39.479
But now it's time to put
a star in our reasonably fast car.

22:39.480 --> 22:41.679
He's one of Britain's
best loved comedians,

22:41.680 --> 22:43.239
he's had a number one hit single,

22:43.240 --> 22:44.799
and, most impressively,

22:44.800 --> 22:48.039
once owned a Mitsubishi Carisma.

22:48.040 --> 22:50.959
And earlier today, he got some
training out on the track

22:50.960 --> 22:52.399
with Mr Charisma himself,

22:52.400 --> 22:53.639
Chris Harris.

22:53.640 --> 22:55.999
- Yeah, I've missed you.
- Ladies and gentlemen,

22:56.000 --> 22:58.800
please welcome to the sofa
Rob Brydon.

23:02.120 --> 23:04.120
Hello. Hello.

23:05.400 --> 23:07.119
- Nice to see you. - Hello.
- How are you, buddy?

23:07.120 --> 23:09.999
Nice to see you, Rob.
Great to meet you. Welcome, welcome.

23:10.000 --> 23:12.159
Cheers. Thank you. Thank you.

23:12.160 --> 23:15.359
All right. Now you've driven round
the track here before,

23:15.360 --> 23:17.199
how did you like the new GT 86?

23:17.200 --> 23:19.799
Before we say anything else,

23:19.800 --> 23:22.879
it's soaking wet.

23:22.880 --> 23:26.599
It is wetter than the worst day

23:26.600 --> 23:29.399
of Noah and Mrs Noah
when they're saying,

23:29.400 --> 23:32.879
"Have we got enough wood?" That is
so wet. It was wet, wasn't it?

23:32.880 --> 23:36.199
- It was wet. - So, the time
is not going to be great, Matt.

23:36.200 --> 23:38.119
So you're saying it's wet.

23:38.120 --> 23:39.639
It was moist!

23:39.640 --> 23:42.399
OK. And how was Chris as a teacher?

23:42.400 --> 23:46.239
He's, yeah, I mean,
an acquired taste, you know.

23:46.240 --> 23:48.759
You know that saying?
Oh, you don't have to tell me!

23:48.760 --> 23:50.279
Yeah. No, he was good. He was good.

23:50.280 --> 23:52.719
Right. OK. Well, let's take
a look at how the training went,

23:52.720 --> 23:54.199
what do you think?

23:54.200 --> 23:56.439
I've never noticed before,
at the start...

23:56.440 --> 23:59.079
- Yeah? - You see the ambulance
and the fire thing.

23:59.080 --> 24:01.199
We always keep those there just to
remind you

24:01.200 --> 24:04.039
- of the importance of your own
safety. - All right, count me down.

24:04.040 --> 24:07.799
OK. Three, two, one, go.

24:07.800 --> 24:09.120
It's a great launch.

24:10.480 --> 24:13.159
And we're going to the left of those
tyres. Left, left, left, left.

24:13.160 --> 24:16.239
- What? Oh, BLEEP. - Left of those tyres
there. - What? LEFT of those tyres?

24:16.240 --> 24:17.999
Yeah, right now, right now,
right now.

24:18.000 --> 24:20.559
- What are you talking about?
- Right! Go right there. - Where?

24:20.560 --> 24:23.919
- Right there. - There?!
- Yeah, turn... - What, by the...?

24:23.920 --> 24:26.399
- By the aeroplanes?
- No, no, before the aeroplanes.

24:26.400 --> 24:28.359
Did you do the medical
before you came on?

24:28.360 --> 24:30.359
- Shut up. - Left here now, left here.

24:30.360 --> 24:33.439
- There's, there's your two white
lines. And then to the right. - Oh!

24:33.440 --> 24:35.439
- Now it's coming back.
- Now it's flowing.

24:35.440 --> 24:37.279
Oh, Lord Almighty, we're fast.

24:37.280 --> 24:38.519
OK, left here, left here.

24:38.520 --> 24:40.359
Oh, oh, oh!

24:40.360 --> 24:42.399
Fourth. Fourth, fourth, fourth.

24:42.400 --> 24:45.319
- Fourth. - That's sixth. That's sixth.
- Really, you want to be fourth here?

24:45.320 --> 24:47.919
- That's sixth, that's sixth,
that's sixth. - Oh. - That's second.

24:47.920 --> 24:50.559
- That's fourth!

24:50.560 --> 24:53.279
- We've got to fourth. - That's good,
you've got some feel for this now,

24:53.280 --> 24:56.839
- haven't you? - Oh, lordy.
- But can you feel... - Whoa!

24:56.840 --> 24:58.399
I'm not sure you know how
close you are

24:58.400 --> 25:01.239
- to a massive accident.

25:01.240 --> 25:03.959
- But let's just go through here...
- Oh, sugary!

25:03.960 --> 25:05.759
Oh. I don't like that.

25:05.760 --> 25:07.639
That is scary.

25:07.640 --> 25:09.279
Full beans, full beans,
over the line.

25:09.280 --> 25:11.199
- Over the line!
- That is so frustrating.

25:11.200 --> 25:12.679
I want your honest opinion...

25:12.680 --> 25:14.839
- Yeah... - ..on the level of support
you've received

25:14.840 --> 25:17.999
- during your training.
- Very poor. Very poor.

25:18.000 --> 25:21.919
I would say my coach is more
interested in himself

25:21.920 --> 25:24.239
than in his young...

25:24.240 --> 25:26.120
his young apprentice.

25:31.920 --> 25:33.159
Well, I don't know.

25:33.160 --> 25:35.799
Looks like you did pretty good
considering it's a lake out there.

25:35.800 --> 25:37.679
But cars are in your blood,
your dad sold cars?

25:37.680 --> 25:42.279
Yeah, my dad was a car salesman.
So when I grew up in south Wales,

25:42.280 --> 25:45.559
in Port Talbot, he'd often bring
different cars back every day.

25:45.560 --> 25:47.479
So I got used to seeing these
different ones

25:47.480 --> 25:48.919
coming back and forth to the house.

25:48.920 --> 25:52.839
And then years later,
he worked for Mitsubishi.

25:52.840 --> 25:54.279
Hence the Carisma.

25:54.280 --> 25:58.399
- Ah, there it is. - Is that known
as being a very bad car, then?

25:58.400 --> 26:00.359
- Oh, it's terrible. - Is it?

26:00.360 --> 26:01.639
- Yeah. - Oh, is that it?

26:01.640 --> 26:04.399
- That's it right there. - Look at the
way the indicator on the left

26:04.400 --> 26:07.479
isn't flush with the headlight,
but the one on the right is.

26:07.480 --> 26:09.439
You see? I mean,
they couldn't even be bothered

26:09.440 --> 26:10.999
to get a good one
for the press photo.

26:11.000 --> 26:13.119
I think, I think what you're
encountering here

26:13.120 --> 26:14.359
for the first time, Chris,

26:14.360 --> 26:16.039
is called perspective.

26:16.040 --> 26:17.439
Ah!

26:17.440 --> 26:19.599
You know how on the left side,
it looks bigger?

26:19.600 --> 26:20.880
Yeah, it's just closer.

26:22.920 --> 26:24.639
OK. And what do you drive now?

26:24.640 --> 26:29.799
At the moment, I have a Jaguar XJ,
and a Land Rover Discovery.

26:29.800 --> 26:32.359
- Oh, dear. - The new one?
- Oh, dear. - Yeah, what's the problem?

26:32.360 --> 26:34.679
What have I done now?!
The new Discovery?

26:34.680 --> 26:36.119
- Yeah. - So you've seen it? - Oh, boy.

26:36.120 --> 26:38.119
- You've seen it from the outside?
- Oh, you're talking...?

26:38.120 --> 26:40.959
- I know, I noticed. - You've opened
a can of worms... - The back of it.

26:40.960 --> 26:43.079
I'm talking about all of it.
Let's start with the sides.

26:43.080 --> 26:44.919
- We'll leave the worst bit till last.
- The sides are OK.

26:44.920 --> 26:47.039
- What's wrong with that?
- Look how much metal there is

26:47.040 --> 26:49.719
- above the rear wheel. Look at it.
- Is that an issue for normal people?

26:49.720 --> 26:51.919
- It is!

26:51.920 --> 26:53.439
Let's move round to the back.

26:53.440 --> 26:55.559
Now, look at the lack
of symmetry here.

26:55.560 --> 26:57.279
- Yeah, I agree. - So, they designed
the whole thing,

26:57.280 --> 26:58.839
at the last minute
someone's run in and gone,

26:58.840 --> 27:00.599
"We've got to put the
number plate somewhere!"

27:00.600 --> 27:02.679
So they've just slapped it there.

27:02.680 --> 27:06.039
And the design inspiration for it,
here we go.

27:08.640 --> 27:13.159
It's designed as an homage
to Geoffrey Boycott's mouth.

27:13.160 --> 27:17.999
It... It is curious, but sometimes
innovation startles us at first.

27:18.000 --> 27:20.599
- It does, it does.
- Where do you stand?

27:20.600 --> 27:22.520
Er... Well, I think it's hideous.

27:25.440 --> 27:28.519
- The Trip. Let's talk about The Trip.
- Yes. Yeah. Tell us about The Trip.

27:28.520 --> 27:30.839
Oh, I'm a huge fan.
Who's a fan of The Trip here?

27:30.840 --> 27:31.919
Yeah.

27:31.920 --> 27:33.879
- It's fantastic.
- Thank you very much. Thank you.

27:33.880 --> 27:36.399
- Very funny. - We drove...
- Does that bring back good memories?

27:36.400 --> 27:39.079
Yeah, that was The Trip To Italy,
which was the second one.

27:39.080 --> 27:41.639
Why choose a Mini Cooper
convertible?

27:41.640 --> 27:43.879
Oh! The Mini was... That was lovely.

27:43.880 --> 27:47.399
Especially, you know, you had
a lot of windy country roads,

27:47.400 --> 27:48.799
especially on the Amalfi coast.

27:48.800 --> 27:51.559
It was lovely to drive.
In fact, I liked it so much,

27:51.560 --> 27:53.559
I actually bought one
when we came back.

27:53.560 --> 27:55.599
- Ooh. What?! - What's wrong with that?

27:55.600 --> 27:58.799
Why would you do that? Cos it was...
It was a really nice drive.

27:58.800 --> 28:01.359
Was it like that rose you have
when you go on holiday?

28:01.360 --> 28:03.199
You know, the four euro rose.

28:03.200 --> 28:04.839
And it's great when you're there...

28:04.840 --> 28:07.639
And you crack a bottle open
three weeks later back in the UK,

28:07.640 --> 28:10.399
- and it tastes like vinegar.
- It's not... It's not quite the same

28:10.400 --> 28:12.199
driving it around Twickenham,

28:12.200 --> 28:14.919
or, you know, as it was
on the Amalfi coast,

28:14.920 --> 28:17.839
- but no, look, I'm going to...
It was a lovely car. - One question.

28:17.840 --> 28:21.279
- Do you still own it? - No.

28:21.280 --> 28:22.799
How long did you own it for?

28:22.800 --> 28:25.279
I don't know, I had it for a year
and a bit, something like that.

28:25.280 --> 28:26.559
Why so long?

28:28.640 --> 28:30.439
I think it's time to see your lap.

28:30.440 --> 28:32.359
Ah. Let's move on to that.

28:32.360 --> 28:35.119
Can I... Did I mention it was wet?
You did mention it was wet.

28:35.120 --> 28:36.519
- But you had fun? - Oh...

28:36.520 --> 28:38.679
It's a blast, right?
It's fantastic. It's really fun.

28:38.680 --> 28:40.039
OK, let's take a look.

28:40.040 --> 28:41.799
Hey, you know what, why don't
you commentate on it?

28:41.800 --> 28:44.199
OK, all right. Here we go.

28:44.200 --> 28:47.959
Well, perfect conditions
for the youthful Rob Brydon.

28:47.960 --> 28:49.199
It's a nice start.

28:49.200 --> 28:51.679
Oh-ho-ho-ho!

28:51.680 --> 28:53.999
Something is flashing
on the dashboard.

28:54.000 --> 28:55.319
I don't know what it means.

28:55.320 --> 28:59.279
That classic Roman profile gripping
the wheel with assuredness

28:59.280 --> 29:01.439
and a strange sensuality.

29:01.440 --> 29:03.639
And he takes that corner with ease.

29:03.640 --> 29:06.799
Look at the way he's going.

29:06.800 --> 29:09.279
And have you noticed it's wet?

29:09.280 --> 29:10.720
Ooh, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo...

29:14.160 --> 29:16.039
Difficult corner, difficult corner,

29:16.040 --> 29:18.199
difficult to see
the white lines there,

29:18.200 --> 29:20.239
but he's done it beautifully.

29:20.240 --> 29:24.919
The inquest heard that although
he took the corner smoothly,

29:24.920 --> 29:28.479
Brydon hadn't anticipated the...

29:28.480 --> 29:31.640
..group of nuns visiting
the aerodrome.

29:32.760 --> 29:34.839
He took out six of them.

29:34.840 --> 29:37.079
Thoughts with the families.

29:37.080 --> 29:40.639
Yes, you don't want to hear
the word "inquest" in your head

29:40.640 --> 29:42.280
when you're doing this lap.

29:45.040 --> 29:48.640
I have to say, Gav, it's a lot
quicker than the Picasso.

29:50.000 --> 29:53.719
This bit, now, I think I got speed
up here, and look at that.

29:53.720 --> 29:55.279
That's not bad, is it?

29:55.280 --> 29:57.119
This looks narrower...

29:57.120 --> 30:00.039
..every time you go through it!

30:01.840 --> 30:04.519
Oh, bloody hell. That was scary.

30:04.520 --> 30:07.599
Oh, Robert! There's no need
for that sort of language,

30:07.600 --> 30:09.399
- you - BLEEP - idiot.

30:09.400 --> 30:11.439
Oh, you...! Damn it.

30:11.440 --> 30:14.999
And he comes now to his jinx,
his nemesis, this penultimate...

30:15.000 --> 30:16.719
Oh, no, he didn't. That was the end!

30:18.720 --> 30:21.160
That shows you how well
I know the course, right?

30:23.720 --> 30:25.200
- That's wet. - Ah.

30:26.600 --> 30:28.319
I've never seen it that wet.

30:28.320 --> 30:30.239
That's monsoon conditions.

30:30.240 --> 30:31.639
I've never seen it that wet.

30:31.640 --> 30:33.799
Well, there we are, then,
whatever the time was...

30:33.800 --> 30:35.639
- Well, I have it right here. - Ah.

30:35.640 --> 30:38.079
- What do you think? - I just want
to beat Tinie Tempah, really.

30:38.080 --> 30:39.999
- You do? - I just feel
in the world of rap,

30:40.000 --> 30:41.719
I feel Tinie is always, you know,

30:41.720 --> 30:42.999
threatening my territory.

30:43.000 --> 30:47.279
So, I just want to let him know.
I'm a big rap star in this country,

30:47.280 --> 30:50.399
you wouldn't know this, Matt,
but, er, I want to beat him.

30:50.400 --> 30:53.199
It was definitely wetter for you
than it was for Tinie.

30:53.200 --> 30:55.999
I think we're going to call
your time, not just with a W,

30:56.000 --> 30:57.239
we're going to put a VW.

30:57.240 --> 30:58.879
VW, thank you. Very wet, yeah.

30:58.880 --> 31:01.479
Thank you. OK, Rob Brydon,
are you ready?

31:01.480 --> 31:04.919
Mmm-hmm. You went around the track
in one minute...

31:04.920 --> 31:05.959
..50...

31:05.960 --> 31:09.879
Oh, for heaven's sake, so I'm
already down the bottom section.

31:09.880 --> 31:12.919
..point... five.

31:12.920 --> 31:19.159
- So I'm just...!
- Oh! It's tough! Sorry, boss.

31:19.160 --> 31:21.639
- Great effort. - Yeah, well, I tried.
It was very wet.

31:21.640 --> 31:24.359
I tried. It was very, very wet.
Ladies and gentlemen, Rob Brydon.

31:27.560 --> 31:30.120
- Fantastic, thanks so much. - Ah...

31:31.320 --> 31:34.639
Earlier on, you remember we were
celebrating the V8 engine

31:34.640 --> 31:36.799
with a classic American road trip.

31:36.800 --> 31:38.359
We'd escaped from a big pit,

31:38.360 --> 31:41.039
staged a good old-fashioned
Wild West shoot out

31:41.040 --> 31:44.639
and had a run-in with the law.
Standard road trip stuff.

31:44.640 --> 31:47.920
Now it's time to head back to Utah
and pick up the story.

31:52.680 --> 31:55.640
The next morning,
we were back on the road again.

31:59.160 --> 32:02.759
And heading towards our destination
on the Nevada border,

32:02.760 --> 32:06.160
we had time to reflect on what we
were really here to celebrate.

32:07.720 --> 32:09.999
There's a personality about the V8

32:10.000 --> 32:13.919
that no other engine configuration
can match, OK?

32:13.920 --> 32:17.799
A V12 is the most exotic
engine configuration.

32:17.800 --> 32:19.039
If you say I've got a V12,

32:19.040 --> 32:23.079
you think of the most expensive,
exotic Italian supercars.

32:23.080 --> 32:25.959
If you think, got a V6,
you're better than ordinary,

32:25.960 --> 32:27.999
but ultimately you're
not the really fast model.

32:28.000 --> 32:29.759
If you say your car's got a V8

32:29.760 --> 32:34.400
it automatically makes it sound like
it's... It's the one you want.

32:37.280 --> 32:40.679
Petrol engines are dying out,
there's no debate about that.

32:40.680 --> 32:43.479
And I can see pros and cons to that.

32:43.480 --> 32:46.359
But it really would be a shame
to lose the V8.

32:46.360 --> 32:47.999
For me...

32:48.000 --> 32:49.160
..the V8 is sacred.

32:52.480 --> 32:57.039
I remember when I was a kid,
I was 16 and a half, and my cousin,

32:57.040 --> 32:59.359
he had saved up his money
to buy a car.

32:59.360 --> 33:04.759
And he bought a 1968 Chevy Camaro
with a 327 V8 in it.

33:04.760 --> 33:06.319
So I had my license before him,

33:06.320 --> 33:08.679
and he really wanted to drive
the car but he couldn't.

33:08.680 --> 33:11.279
So I talked him into,
"Well, let's take the car out.

33:11.280 --> 33:12.959
"I'll drive."

33:12.960 --> 33:16.639
It was like my first
experience with a V8.

33:16.640 --> 33:18.319
That thing was great.

33:18.320 --> 33:21.439
By the time he got his licence,
the transmission needed a rebuild

33:21.440 --> 33:22.920
- cos I beat the - BLEEP - out of it.

33:26.400 --> 33:27.520
You're welcome.

33:29.280 --> 33:32.479
Eager to continue
our V8 celebration,

33:32.480 --> 33:34.560
we were told to head
to a local racetrack.

33:37.080 --> 33:39.679
Rocky Mountain Raceways.

33:39.680 --> 33:42.600
An oval circuit,
which could only mean one thing...

33:43.920 --> 33:45.120
..Nascar.

33:55.520 --> 33:58.359
Wow! You know where we are?

33:58.360 --> 34:02.399
- Where? - It was 1957,

34:02.400 --> 34:04.639
the final race of the Nascar season.

34:04.640 --> 34:08.239
Bubba Passwater's got to finish
third to secure the title.

34:08.239 --> 34:11.399
OK, on the last lap, he's third
coming out of the final corner,

34:11.400 --> 34:14.918
right over there. As he gets onto
the straightaway, he gets tapped,

34:14.920 --> 34:18.839
he corrects, clips the wall - boom!

34:18.840 --> 34:20.438
The car goes up in a ball of flames.

34:20.440 --> 34:23.559
He is out of control.
He spins across the line backwards,

34:23.560 --> 34:25.399
takes the title by a single point.

34:25.400 --> 34:27.639
Really? No, I have no idea
where we are.

34:29.880 --> 34:32.518
Luckily, a local man
on a golf buggy did.

34:32.520 --> 34:33.800
Here we go.

34:35.400 --> 34:37.599
- Hello. - Hello. - Hello.

34:37.600 --> 34:39.518
- There you go. - Thank you very much.

34:41.480 --> 34:43.040
Ooh... Ooh!

34:46.880 --> 34:50.359
It's a challenge. "In a tribute
to America's favourite motorsport,

34:50.360 --> 34:54.639
"you will each attempt to set the
fastest time over five flying laps."

34:54.639 --> 34:57.720
And we'd each get some help
from the real deal.

35:00.000 --> 35:01.359
Born back in the '40s,

35:01.360 --> 35:03.639
when moonshine runners
took their outlaw V8s

35:03.640 --> 35:05.040
and started to race them...

35:06.320 --> 35:07.919
..70 years on,

35:07.920 --> 35:11.520
Nascar remains America's
most popular V8 motor sport.

35:13.000 --> 35:14.440
Big on noise...

35:16.480 --> 35:19.679
..if a little short on variety.

35:19.680 --> 35:21.319
Wait, wait, so let me
get this straight.

35:21.320 --> 35:23.319
We just go up there, take a left...

35:23.320 --> 35:26.319
There. And then what, it's a left?
Over there.

35:26.320 --> 35:28.799
- Rory... - And then left...
- ..these are simple people, OK?

35:28.800 --> 35:31.440
- You've met Matt. Let's go.
Come on. - He's right.

35:33.480 --> 35:34.720
That's cold.

35:43.520 --> 35:45.839
For this Nascar-inspired test,

35:45.840 --> 35:49.079
we would each be timed over
five laps of the track.

35:49.080 --> 35:50.479
For the first two laps,

35:50.480 --> 35:53.839
we would pick up some extra speed
by slipstreaming the pace car

35:53.840 --> 35:56.800
before overtaking for a three-lap
sprint to the finish.

35:58.160 --> 35:59.719
I'll try and explain it.

35:59.720 --> 36:03.199
The car in front is bashing
a great big hole in the air, OK?

36:03.200 --> 36:06.759
So you nudge in behind that car,
you get the benefit of that hole.

36:06.760 --> 36:09.800
So you've got less air resistance,
ergo, you travel faster.

36:14.360 --> 36:17.720
That's quick. That's loud.

36:21.840 --> 36:25.840
I've got to judge when to duck out
to get my maximum aero advantage.

36:27.400 --> 36:31.519
Time it right,
and it's called the slingshot.

36:31.520 --> 36:32.760
I'm going!

36:37.360 --> 36:38.919
It's quite physical.

36:38.920 --> 36:40.880
You have to really brace yourself.

36:47.000 --> 36:48.519
Whoa!

36:48.520 --> 36:50.959
That... is tiring.

36:50.960 --> 36:53.800
So, with Chris having demonstrated
the theory...

36:55.800 --> 36:57.240
..Rory was up next.

37:01.400 --> 37:03.080
I'm following a Nascar.

37:04.240 --> 37:05.720
Dear Lord.

37:08.360 --> 37:11.239
When Jaguar developed
the F-type SVR,

37:11.240 --> 37:14.599
do you think they thought about
bringing it to an oval in Utah?

37:14.600 --> 37:16.119
Probably not.

37:16.120 --> 37:18.319
Wait for it, wait for it,
wait for it, wait for it.

37:18.320 --> 37:22.159
- And once he cleared the pace
car... - NOW!

37:22.160 --> 37:24.319
..Rory found driving round
in circles

37:24.320 --> 37:26.679
much more difficult than he thought.

37:26.680 --> 37:28.559
OK, late apex, late apex.

37:28.560 --> 37:30.839
That's got to be the secret, right?

37:30.840 --> 37:32.559
Oh, that's too high.

37:32.560 --> 37:34.719
Turn it in, turn it in, turn it in.

37:34.720 --> 37:37.400
He's just added about a quarter
of a mile to his lap there.

37:38.600 --> 37:40.599
But what he lacked in technique...

37:40.600 --> 37:42.520
Bravery, bravery, bravery.

37:44.040 --> 37:46.079
..he made up for in recklessness.

37:46.080 --> 37:48.919
That is close to the wall!
That is close to the wall.

37:48.920 --> 37:51.439
Whoa!

37:51.440 --> 37:52.840
Yes!

37:55.280 --> 37:56.560
Oh, my God!

37:57.920 --> 37:59.639
Now I'm no mind-reader,

37:59.640 --> 38:02.360
but it seemed like he was pleased
with his run.

38:06.560 --> 38:08.959
That was quite
a proficient doughnut.

38:08.960 --> 38:13.440
Finally, it was time to unleash
the 850-horsepower beast.

38:16.120 --> 38:17.720
Which was a bit of a handful.

38:19.160 --> 38:23.839
The thing has got so much power
that I don't dare pin it

38:23.840 --> 38:25.480
until I get it straightened out.

38:29.280 --> 38:31.040
All right, here he goes, I'm going.

38:35.360 --> 38:37.800
- That sounds fantastic. - Mega.

38:42.280 --> 38:45.399
The grip in the front end
of this thing is awesome.

38:45.400 --> 38:46.960
It's like King Kong.

38:53.000 --> 38:54.520
- Well, it sounded good. - It did.

38:56.480 --> 38:58.919
I mean, look at him.
He's just been following a Nascar,

38:58.920 --> 39:03.319
he's in a hopped-up Mustang,
in Utah, on a short oval -

39:03.320 --> 39:05.519
he's basically in American heaven,
isn't he?

39:05.520 --> 39:09.320
Give that man a foot-long wiener
and he's complete.

39:15.280 --> 39:17.319
Ah, this must be the times!

39:17.320 --> 39:18.999
- Here we go. - Bring it.

39:19.000 --> 39:22.560
Thank you. Yeah, go back that way,
it's easier.

39:24.600 --> 39:28.239
"Matt LeBlanc.
You did it in one minute...

39:28.240 --> 39:30.959
"30.6.

39:30.960 --> 39:35.120
"Rory. You did it in one minute...
30...

39:36.360 --> 39:37.520
"one..."

39:38.920 --> 39:41.079
It might get better. "..point four."

39:41.080 --> 39:42.839
- So, it doesn't.
- You got closer to him.

39:42.840 --> 39:45.639
- I gotcha. - But you did have 200 more
horsepower than me, but well done.

39:45.640 --> 39:47.559
Oh, God, here we go, here we go.

39:47.560 --> 39:49.279
- Yeah, yeah. "Chris Harris." - Come on.

39:49.280 --> 39:50.959
- "You did it..." - Come on.

39:50.960 --> 39:52.440
"in one minute..."

39:54.560 --> 39:57.999
- Come on. - What do you want
to do for dinner? - Just...!

39:58.000 --> 39:59.999
"Chris Harris, you did it
in one minute..."

40:00.000 --> 40:02.119
Yep, next word, next word.

40:02.120 --> 40:04.799
- "..20..." - Yes! - "..8.1."

40:04.800 --> 40:06.479
- Congratulations. - Yes! - Way to go.

40:06.480 --> 40:10.599
- You see? - Mr McLaren.
- Upholding Woking's honour.

40:10.600 --> 40:11.839
Said no-one ever.

40:14.680 --> 40:16.119
- Well done, well done. - Thank you.

40:16.120 --> 40:19.359
- Congratulations. - I'm pleased with
that. - Now... "Your prize

40:19.360 --> 40:22.679
"is to take part in one of America's
most exciting race events..."

40:22.680 --> 40:23.959
Do I get to drive that?

40:23.960 --> 40:26.519
"chain car figure of eight
racing."

40:26.520 --> 40:29.879
- What? - What? - Chain car figure
of eight racing.

40:29.880 --> 40:31.959
Says it right there. What's that?
How do I know?

40:31.960 --> 40:34.599
Let me see those times.
I don't want to do it.

40:34.600 --> 40:35.839
- But you have to. - I don't want to.

40:35.840 --> 40:37.319
- But you have to.
- Well, I don't want to.

40:37.320 --> 40:39.880
- But you have to. - So I have to...
I don't HAVE to do anything!

40:42.800 --> 40:46.799
I'm sitting in a 1977 Pontiac

40:46.800 --> 40:49.279
wondering why on earth I tried
to win that last challenge,

40:49.280 --> 40:51.520
cos this is not a prize,
this is a punishment.

40:52.960 --> 40:55.599
Yes! Figure of eight racing -

40:55.600 --> 40:58.919
the greatest motorsport
we'd just heard of.

40:58.920 --> 41:00.759
Three cars chained together

41:00.760 --> 41:04.839
racing around a track
shaped like the number eight.

41:04.840 --> 41:07.400
Which, of course, means a crossover
in the middle.

41:08.800 --> 41:11.639
Better still,
with Harris in the rear car,

41:11.640 --> 41:14.079
only controlling the brakes,

41:14.080 --> 41:16.599
and the middle car
just an empty shell,

41:16.600 --> 41:20.719
the driver in the front car would be
in charge of both the steering

41:20.720 --> 41:22.439
and the acceleration.

41:22.440 --> 41:26.119
So, it was essential that Chris
had a responsible,

41:26.120 --> 41:28.639
safety-conscious team-mate.

41:28.640 --> 41:29.880
Hey, buddy!

41:32.720 --> 41:35.879
- Oh, God, no. - Let's smash some stuff!

41:35.880 --> 41:38.880
No, let's not smash some stuff,
Sabine!

41:40.960 --> 41:42.439
Lining up on the grid,

41:42.440 --> 41:45.479
and with Chris still adjusting
to his new role...

41:45.480 --> 41:47.799
Brake, Harris! Yeah.

41:47.800 --> 41:49.919
- Oh, boom. - Sorry.

41:49.920 --> 41:52.760
..Team Top Gear would be
starting at the back of the field.

41:54.080 --> 41:55.960
This is ridiculous, it really is.

41:57.960 --> 42:00.039
One of those cars is a hearse!

42:00.040 --> 42:02.880
Perfect.

42:04.720 --> 42:06.240
She just sounds demented.

42:17.520 --> 42:19.159
- Woohoo! - It's on!

42:19.160 --> 42:20.640
Go, go, go, go!

42:22.320 --> 42:25.079
Apparently it would be
a six-lap race,

42:25.080 --> 42:27.319
assuming, that is,
they'd last that long.

42:27.320 --> 42:28.639
Whoa, Harris!

42:28.640 --> 42:29.879
What's she doing?

42:29.880 --> 42:31.840
Oh, my God!

42:33.120 --> 42:36.039
- Whoo! - I've been in a car
with Sabine,

42:36.040 --> 42:38.399
and it was one of the scariest
things I've ever done,

42:38.400 --> 42:39.960
but I think this tops it.

42:41.200 --> 42:44.559
Oh! Ow! Ow!

42:44.560 --> 42:46.959
Nevertheless, by the end of
the first lap,

42:46.960 --> 42:49.839
Sabine had somehow dragged them
up to fifth place.

42:49.840 --> 42:51.959
- Yeah! - You're all right, Chris,
hang in there.

42:51.960 --> 42:54.199
It looks like she knows
what she's doing.

42:54.200 --> 42:56.079
- No, we don't know. - We don't.

42:56.080 --> 42:57.399
But then...

42:57.400 --> 42:59.600
- Oh, my...

43:00.840 --> 43:02.479
Ow!

43:02.480 --> 43:03.680
Whoa!

43:06.240 --> 43:08.119
Scheisse!

43:08.120 --> 43:10.479
Snared up by another chain car,

43:10.480 --> 43:12.999
the rest of the field
started to pull away.

43:13.000 --> 43:14.999
And by the time Sabine
broke them free...

43:15.000 --> 43:18.279
Yeah!

43:18.280 --> 43:21.239
Nice move, Sabine, way to go!

43:21.240 --> 43:24.559
..the rest of the pack
were half a lap ahead.

43:24.560 --> 43:28.000
Which, in figure of eight racing,
is a bit of a problem.

43:30.000 --> 43:31.239
Ow!

43:31.240 --> 43:32.999
Whoo!

43:33.000 --> 43:36.759
Ow! Oh, my God.

43:36.760 --> 43:39.559
This is the worst thing
I've ever done.

43:39.560 --> 43:41.559
Unfortunately for Chris, though,

43:41.560 --> 43:43.360
Sabine is no quitter.

43:46.200 --> 43:48.519
Brake, Harris.

43:48.520 --> 43:50.200
Whoo! Yeah! We got them!

43:51.400 --> 43:53.120
Go, go, go, go, go, go!

43:55.200 --> 43:58.719
Ow! Oh, my God!

43:58.720 --> 44:02.759
And by now, the competition were
having problems of their own.

44:02.760 --> 44:04.840
- Oh! There's a wreck up there.
- Whoa, Harris!

44:06.440 --> 44:08.119
I can't see anything.

44:08.120 --> 44:10.119
This is terrifying.

44:14.920 --> 44:18.680
With two laps to go, Sabine had
clawed them back up to fourth.

44:22.240 --> 44:24.400
But things were about to get uglier.

44:27.120 --> 44:30.159
- Ow! - Chris, where are you?

44:31.800 --> 44:33.839
Oh, not again.

44:33.840 --> 44:36.439
Ow! This is carnage.

44:36.440 --> 44:37.840
This is awesome!

44:43.880 --> 44:47.359
Entering the final lap,
Sabine could sense a podium finish.

44:47.360 --> 44:50.599
Yeah! I do! I do! I do!

44:50.600 --> 44:52.439
And with just the final corner left,

44:52.440 --> 44:55.039
she'd go through
the hearse to get it.

44:55.040 --> 44:57.079
- On three! - Not through there, Sabine!

44:57.080 --> 44:58.879
Not through there!

44:58.880 --> 45:01.040
Whoo! Yes!

45:03.480 --> 45:05.839
Push, push, push!

45:05.840 --> 45:07.519
- Yeah! Way to go! Way to go! - Whoo!

45:07.520 --> 45:10.719
Go, go, go, go, go, go,
go, go, go, go, go!

45:10.720 --> 45:13.640
Yeah! Woohoo!

45:17.880 --> 45:22.239
Chequered flag. You're in third.
Way to go! Way to go! Way to go!

45:22.240 --> 45:24.679
Woohoo! Yee-ha!

45:27.880 --> 45:30.000
Chris, good job!
Are you still there?

45:31.520 --> 45:33.559
Just.

45:33.560 --> 45:35.919
You total lunatic.

45:40.560 --> 45:42.879
With Chris choosing
not to stick around

45:42.880 --> 45:45.959
to see what the prize
for third place was,

45:45.960 --> 45:47.680
we got back on the road.

45:50.960 --> 45:54.439
I think the greatest thing America
has given to planet Earth

45:54.440 --> 45:56.799
is chain car racing. That was great.

45:56.800 --> 45:58.880
It's one of our proudest moments,
really.

46:05.280 --> 46:07.119
Sensing Chris didn't wholly agree,

46:07.120 --> 46:09.479
and I hate seeing
the little guy upset,

46:09.480 --> 46:11.399
I had an idea to cheer him up.

46:11.400 --> 46:14.479
Hey, you know what?
I've got a game we could play.

46:14.480 --> 46:16.880
It's called Nascar or Nas-can't.

46:18.680 --> 46:23.559
So, I'm going to say a name and you
tell me if it's a real Nascar driver

46:23.560 --> 46:25.839
or just someone that I've made up.

46:25.840 --> 46:27.719
OK?

46:27.720 --> 46:29.559
OK.

46:29.560 --> 46:31.799
How about Lake Speed?

46:31.800 --> 46:34.599
That sounds more like a place
than a person.

46:34.600 --> 46:36.519
That's a real Nascar driver.

46:36.520 --> 46:39.479
Lake Speed is Nascar driver?

46:39.480 --> 46:42.360
Yes, it is. How about Dick Trickle?

46:44.240 --> 46:46.199
THAT'S a real Nascar driver.

46:46.200 --> 46:49.439
He's real, yeah.
OK, here's another one.

46:49.440 --> 46:53.079
- Patty Grossman.
- Yeah, he sounds very Nascar.

46:53.080 --> 46:54.599
That's my mother!

47:00.920 --> 47:05.000
With Harris feeling better,
soon we all had a reason to smile.

47:06.280 --> 47:08.600
Because our goal
at the Nevada border...

47:09.760 --> 47:11.480
..was finally within reach.

47:16.960 --> 47:19.400
Oh, I know where we're going.

47:20.480 --> 47:22.360
I think I know where
we're going too.

47:23.800 --> 47:25.799
Yeah...

47:25.800 --> 47:27.240
Where are we going?

47:28.840 --> 47:30.680
I think we're headed to Bonneville.

47:32.080 --> 47:34.160
America's fastest race track.

47:35.280 --> 47:38.359
For over a century,
pilgrims of extreme speed

47:38.360 --> 47:41.400
have been drawn here
from all over the world...

47:42.760 --> 47:47.280
..to 46 square miles of pristine
unbroken salt flats.

47:48.920 --> 47:53.479
This is where the 300,
the 400, the 500,

47:53.480 --> 47:57.560
even the 600mph land speed
barriers were broken.

47:59.680 --> 48:02.160
This... is Bonneville.

48:04.000 --> 48:06.119
I can't believe I'm here.

48:06.120 --> 48:08.279
As we pulled onto the salt, though,

48:08.280 --> 48:11.200
the dry lake bed
did have a bit of a problem.

48:13.360 --> 48:15.879
Oh, no.

48:15.880 --> 48:18.599
Well, this is... moist.

48:18.600 --> 48:22.199
Freak rain had blown in,
flooding the flats

48:22.200 --> 48:25.240
and washing away any chance
of a top speed run.

48:27.960 --> 48:29.000
What the hell?

48:33.120 --> 48:35.080
I'm absolutely gutted.

48:36.120 --> 48:39.239
I've waited 30-odd years
to come to the Mecca of speed

48:39.240 --> 48:41.919
and when I finally get here

48:41.920 --> 48:43.160
it's a lake.

48:44.800 --> 48:46.120
What are we going to do?

48:51.160 --> 48:52.879
Hi.

48:52.880 --> 48:54.919
- How are you? - Good. - Thank you.

48:54.920 --> 48:57.239
- Sorry. - Hey, it's not your fault.

48:57.240 --> 48:58.559
Or is it?

48:58.560 --> 49:01.559
- No, no. - OK. "Chin up.

49:01.560 --> 49:04.279
"Your celebration of V8s
isn't over yet.

49:04.280 --> 49:05.999
"Just up the road is a race track

49:06.000 --> 49:08.319
"where your new final challenge
awaits."

49:08.320 --> 49:10.039
But it's not Bonneville, is it?

49:10.040 --> 49:13.120
Well, yeah, but it's a racetrack, so
at least we'll be able to go fast.

49:19.520 --> 49:21.479
Well, it's got to be
better than this.

49:21.480 --> 49:23.079
Yeah. Come on.

49:23.080 --> 49:24.759
Really? So that was Bonneville?

49:24.760 --> 49:28.759
35 years waiting, and I stand
in front of a puddle and go again.

49:28.760 --> 49:30.280
Well, you can get in if you want.

49:34.960 --> 49:36.520
Gutted.

49:39.400 --> 49:40.599
I suppose I've now got

49:40.600 --> 49:43.559
one of the worst Bonneville stories
of anyone I know.

49:43.560 --> 49:45.879
Rory, how are you feeling about it?

49:45.880 --> 49:50.679
Yeah, I wanted to smash through
that 200mph barrier in this thing,

49:50.680 --> 49:54.439
- but it wasn't to be. - What is
the top speed of that car, Rory?

49:54.440 --> 49:55.919
Just over 200.

49:55.920 --> 49:58.160
- How about you? - What is it exactly?

50:00.040 --> 50:02.199
200.

50:02.200 --> 50:07.399
So, how exactly were you going to
"smash through" the 200mph barrier?

50:07.400 --> 50:10.639
I was hoping for a bit
of a tailwind.

50:10.640 --> 50:11.880
Good answer.

50:13.480 --> 50:15.559
But then, just up the road...

50:15.560 --> 50:17.759
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Look at this.

50:17.760 --> 50:19.320
..Chris spotted an opportunity.

50:20.960 --> 50:23.320
I'm turning in here.
Follow me in here. Come on.

50:27.200 --> 50:30.199
Dude, the sign says
"no trespassing."

50:30.200 --> 50:32.159
An open gate is an invitation,

50:32.160 --> 50:35.559
and I have an itch to scratch.

50:35.560 --> 50:36.759
Oh, yeah.

50:36.760 --> 50:41.719
We'd stumbled across a very quiet,
very long runway.

50:41.720 --> 50:43.240
This looks great.

50:45.400 --> 50:47.159
All right, so what are we thinking?

50:47.160 --> 50:49.919
- Drag race? - Yes, please!

50:49.920 --> 50:51.760
It's time to let the big dog eat.

50:52.960 --> 50:54.599
Here we go. Here we go.

50:54.600 --> 50:56.679
How much power have you got again?

50:56.680 --> 50:59.559
850 horsepower.

50:59.560 --> 51:02.559
You may have 850, but I want to know
how much you can use in the first

51:02.560 --> 51:05.079
- three gears. - What are you saying?

51:05.080 --> 51:07.639
You can use more of your power
than I can use of mine?

51:07.640 --> 51:09.799
I can use all of my power
in the first three gears.

51:09.800 --> 51:12.759
I don't think you can use
even a small percentage of yours,

51:12.760 --> 51:15.880
and hopefully by the time you get
going, I'm gone.

51:16.880 --> 51:19.119
I'll tell you what, Chris,

51:19.120 --> 51:23.039
you pull out yours and I'll pull out
just enough to beat you.

51:28.520 --> 51:30.480
All right, are we doing this,
or what?

51:31.520 --> 51:34.959
OK, I'll call it. We go on "go."

51:34.960 --> 51:37.320
Three, two...

51:38.560 --> 51:40.560
..one, go.

51:45.120 --> 51:47.559
Oh, the Jag is gone!

51:47.560 --> 51:49.360
I'm winning! I'm winning!

51:50.400 --> 51:52.439
Whoo! I'm winning!

51:52.440 --> 51:53.480
OK, no, I'm not.

51:55.000 --> 51:56.959
Bye-bye, Mr Reid.

51:56.960 --> 51:58.399
Where's the yellow car?

51:58.400 --> 52:00.559
That's the one that's worrying me.

52:00.560 --> 52:01.880
There's the red one.

52:03.000 --> 52:05.159
Oh!

52:05.160 --> 52:06.999
OK, 160.

52:07.000 --> 52:08.679
I still can't see the yellow car.

52:08.680 --> 52:10.479
170.

52:10.480 --> 52:13.400
Come on! Hya! Hya! Hya!

52:15.600 --> 52:19.680
199. 201. 203 over the line.

52:21.720 --> 52:23.519
Damn it!

52:23.520 --> 52:25.759
This is the baby McLaren.

52:25.760 --> 52:29.919
This is the Ford Fiesta
of the McLaren range

52:29.920 --> 52:34.959
and it just did 203 and smoked
an 850-horsepower Mustang.

52:34.960 --> 52:36.920
Boy, that McLaren is fast.

52:40.000 --> 52:42.679
So, as we hurried on our way again,

52:42.680 --> 52:45.319
our impromptu drag race
had taught us

52:45.320 --> 52:48.879
that naturally my McLaren
is devastatingly quick,

52:48.880 --> 52:53.239
that Matt's Mustang can't actually
use 850 horsepower,

52:53.240 --> 52:56.880
and that Rory had his own
unique take on the result.

52:58.760 --> 53:03.119
Chris and Matt, do you know what
the speed limit is in the UK?

53:03.120 --> 53:06.159
- Yes. - It's 70mph,

53:06.160 --> 53:11.359
and I'd like to point out
that in that drag race up to 90mph

53:11.360 --> 53:13.799
the F-Type SVR was in the lead,

53:13.800 --> 53:16.879
therefore, in real-world situations,

53:16.880 --> 53:19.799
this car is quicker than the McLaren

53:19.800 --> 53:23.239
and an 850-horsepower Mustang.

53:23.240 --> 53:27.399
Even by your standards, Rory, you're
fumbling around for a false glory.

53:27.400 --> 53:31.079
No, no, no, no, no. I'm about
300 kilos heavier than that McLaren,

53:31.080 --> 53:33.519
and about the same thing as that
giant fridge on wheels

53:33.520 --> 53:36.319
that you're driving. But I think
I acquitted myself pretty well.

53:36.320 --> 53:38.159
This is a great all-round car.

53:38.160 --> 53:39.559
Yeah, I think I drove by you

53:39.560 --> 53:41.879
like you forgot where
the accelerator was.

53:41.880 --> 53:46.599
Listen, guys, come on, I think this
car did surprise you a little bit.

53:46.600 --> 53:48.279
You might look at
this car and think,

53:48.280 --> 53:52.560
it's no McLaren, it's no Hennessy,
but it's hanging in there.

53:54.280 --> 53:55.959
I wasn't thinking that, no.

53:58.480 --> 54:00.959
And before Rory could come up with
more ways

54:00.960 --> 54:03.319
in which his Jag wasn't as quick,

54:03.320 --> 54:07.159
we reached our V8s'
new final playground.

54:07.160 --> 54:09.439
I see flags. I see flags.

54:09.440 --> 54:12.399
Yeah, I see grandstands.
I see grandstands.

54:12.400 --> 54:15.920
Could this be the scene of another
McLaren victory? I hear you ask.

54:20.680 --> 54:23.960
Could this be the scene of another
McLaren victory? I hear you...

54:33.680 --> 54:35.359
Now we're talking.

54:35.360 --> 54:37.359
Whoo!

54:37.360 --> 54:38.440
Look at the view.

54:41.480 --> 54:44.119
Oh, yeah, look at that!

54:44.120 --> 54:45.799
That is a GT40.

54:45.800 --> 54:47.840
- Yeah. - That is beautiful.

54:48.840 --> 54:51.159
Yes, the GT40.

54:51.160 --> 54:52.999
1960s icon,

54:53.000 --> 54:55.559
and ground-breaking,
Ferrari-beating,

54:55.560 --> 54:58.040
Le Mans-winning masterpiece.

54:59.200 --> 55:02.119
That is a legendary V8, right there.

55:02.120 --> 55:04.360
Hey, how are you? Oh, cool.
Right on, thank you.

55:05.480 --> 55:08.199
"For your final challenge,
you will now take on

55:08.200 --> 55:10.919
"one of the greatest V8s
of all time." That's true.

55:10.920 --> 55:13.399
That is really true. Which won't
be a problem, I don't think,

55:13.400 --> 55:17.519
because we've got more power,
better brakes, better...

55:17.520 --> 55:20.679
Uh-oh. That changes things.

55:20.680 --> 55:22.959
Does he have the correct visa?

55:22.960 --> 55:24.560
Is he allowed to be here?

55:26.240 --> 55:28.680
Unfortunately, he was.

55:33.160 --> 55:34.919
That is a magnificent sound.

55:34.920 --> 55:35.960
Wow.

55:37.800 --> 55:41.759
The Stig would set a time
for six laps of the circuit,

55:41.760 --> 55:46.239
a time which we would have to
then beat as a team.

55:46.240 --> 55:47.319
Pros and cons.

55:47.320 --> 55:50.879
We have more power,
more modern tyres and brakes.

55:50.880 --> 55:53.520
- Cons... - He has him. - Yeah.

55:55.080 --> 55:57.800
And all too soon,
Stig's six laps were up.

56:00.400 --> 56:03.519
10 minutes 11.4.

56:03.520 --> 56:06.959
OK, that's the combined time
to beat.

56:06.960 --> 56:09.679
So, to pit our V8s against the GT40

56:09.680 --> 56:12.240
we'd be running a relay
of two laps each.

56:14.360 --> 56:17.319
And with a standing start
for the first leg,

56:17.320 --> 56:22.279
we needed the best car for
pure off-the-line acceleration.

56:22.280 --> 56:24.119
All right, Rory, are you ready?

56:24.120 --> 56:25.839
Never been readier.

56:25.840 --> 56:28.999
Three, two...

56:29.000 --> 56:30.920
..one, go!

56:32.840 --> 56:33.880
Whoo!

56:37.320 --> 56:38.840
Sounds quick.

56:42.480 --> 56:43.879
All-wheel drive...

56:43.880 --> 56:45.440
..for the win.

56:49.400 --> 56:51.799
Spot your apex, Reid.
Spot your apex.

56:51.800 --> 56:53.639
There she is.

56:53.640 --> 56:56.479
On that power. Oh, that's good.

56:56.480 --> 56:57.680
So good.

56:59.400 --> 57:00.919
The engine is still making noise.

57:00.920 --> 57:03.640
- That's a good sign. - This means
that he's not rolled it.

57:05.400 --> 57:07.320
Yes! Yes!

57:10.440 --> 57:14.359
Oh, that's messy, Reid.
Come on, tidier, tidier.

57:14.360 --> 57:18.320
All right, so, I need
a 1:42 average lap time.

57:19.680 --> 57:23.319
- Yeah, he's kind of missed that one.
- He's overcooked that one.

57:23.320 --> 57:26.919
Oh, no, this is looking like a 1:45.

57:26.920 --> 57:27.960
Argh!

57:32.000 --> 57:36.160
- Focus, Rory. Focus. Focus. Focus.
- I'm focusing! I'm focusing!

57:37.160 --> 57:38.759
Come on, Rory. Here he comes.

57:38.760 --> 57:40.599
You should get in the car, maybe.

57:40.600 --> 57:44.319
- Oh. - I don't know if this
is good enough.

57:44.320 --> 57:45.720
I don't know.

57:51.920 --> 57:53.160
Come on, guys. Come on, guys.

57:55.560 --> 57:58.199
- Here we go. - Come on.

57:58.200 --> 58:00.799
Go, go, go, go, go!

58:00.800 --> 58:01.880
Push, Harris! Push!

58:04.120 --> 58:06.919
Two laps down,
and Rory's run in the Jag

58:06.920 --> 58:09.879
had left us six seconds
off the pace.

58:09.880 --> 58:11.959
To beat the GT40...

58:11.960 --> 58:13.759
Smooth, Chris. Smooth!

58:13.760 --> 58:16.000
..Chris and his McLaren
needed their A-game.

58:18.800 --> 58:21.959
This is a car that was doing 200mph
in a straight line

58:21.960 --> 58:25.640
but it's now agile and fast here.

58:27.720 --> 58:29.999
Oh, good line through there. Nice.

58:30.000 --> 58:31.639
Nice! Nice!

58:31.640 --> 58:32.840
Just floor it.

58:35.640 --> 58:37.160
Push, push, push!

58:38.280 --> 58:39.839
OK, that's a 1:38.

58:39.840 --> 58:43.159
- We've got a shot here.
- OK, that's good.

58:43.160 --> 58:45.120
I'm buying us some time now.

58:47.200 --> 58:49.119
Now just three seconds behind...

58:49.120 --> 58:51.680
All right, Chris, one more clean
one. One more clean one.

58:53.720 --> 58:55.839
..we were back in the hunt.

58:55.840 --> 58:58.839
OK, we're at 5:58, 5:59,
six minutes.

58:58.840 --> 59:00.720
Chris, come on. Push, push, push!

59:02.960 --> 59:05.400
Let's do it for America.
Don't let me down, girl.

59:07.040 --> 59:09.239
Go on, Matt. Go on, Matt.

59:09.240 --> 59:11.080
Come on, Matt. Launch it!

59:16.880 --> 59:19.639
All right, here we go. Here we go.

59:19.640 --> 59:21.800
This was it, the last leg.

59:23.800 --> 59:26.960
And however this tribute to the
greatest of all engines would end...

59:28.360 --> 59:30.280
..at least one thing was certain.

59:31.320 --> 59:33.239
That's it. That's the stuff.

59:33.240 --> 59:38.040
The V8 engine is a fighter, and one
that still packs a serious punch.

59:40.400 --> 59:42.799
Where are we at? - 7:30. 7:30.

59:42.800 --> 59:45.319
- Are we ahead of time, or..?
- We're on the edge.

59:45.320 --> 59:47.959
Come on, baby. Come on.
Come on. Come on. Come on.

59:47.960 --> 59:49.080
Come on.

59:50.720 --> 59:53.320
Oh, it's got so much freaking power.

59:55.240 --> 59:56.520
Come on!

59:58.960 --> 01:00:00.480
All right, last lap.

01:00:01.480 --> 01:00:03.439
He's got to do the lap of his life.

01:00:03.440 --> 01:00:05.759
Come on, Mustang!

01:00:05.760 --> 01:00:08.440
Come on, LeBlanc, give it your best.
I want your best.

01:00:13.760 --> 01:00:15.000
Come on, Matt. Push!

01:00:16.160 --> 01:00:17.400
There we go. Come on.

01:00:18.520 --> 01:00:20.479
That's it, that's it, that's it.

01:00:20.480 --> 01:00:21.720
OK, here we go.

01:00:25.440 --> 01:00:26.880
Come on!

01:00:38.120 --> 01:00:39.839
So, the big question -

01:00:39.840 --> 01:00:43.639
did our exquisite array of
state-of-the-art V8 sports cars

01:00:43.640 --> 01:00:46.359
open up a can of whupass
on the old days?

01:00:46.360 --> 01:00:48.999
Well, we'll never know.
OK, on next week's show...

01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:50.439
- Hold on, Matthew. - What? What?

01:00:50.440 --> 01:00:52.399
- What? - You've got to give them
the answer.

01:00:52.400 --> 01:00:54.359
No, I don't got to give them
the answer.

01:00:54.360 --> 01:00:57.039
That's why they're here.
They want to know the times.

01:00:57.040 --> 01:00:59.439
Come on! Yes.

01:00:59.440 --> 01:01:01.039
OK, fine.

01:01:01.040 --> 01:01:03.439
We were two seconds slower.

01:01:03.440 --> 01:01:05.359
And I'm very disappointed
in you, Chris.

01:01:05.360 --> 01:01:08.119
- I was quicker than him. - Yeah, but
I don't expect anything from him.

01:01:08.120 --> 01:01:10.159
What?! OK, that's fair.

01:01:10.160 --> 01:01:12.759
- Fine. - Yeah. - But what
we're telling the viewers

01:01:12.760 --> 01:01:15.039
is that the best V8 sports car
money can buy

01:01:15.040 --> 01:01:19.559
is a 50-year-old V8 sports car
that's not actually for sale?

01:01:19.560 --> 01:01:21.119
Exactly, yeah.

01:01:21.120 --> 01:01:23.839
And on that essential piece
of consumer advice

01:01:23.840 --> 01:01:25.079
we must end the show.

01:01:25.080 --> 01:01:27.200
- See you next week. Goodnight.
- Goodnight.
