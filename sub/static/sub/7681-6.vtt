01:52.595 --> 01:56.015
Some things in life just aren't fair.

01:56.182 --> 01:58.682
This is one of them.

02:00.561 --> 02:04.356
I suppose I could always call
the police.

02:04.357 --> 02:06.857
Or not.

02:10.696 --> 02:15.033
I don't believe this. Bedroom stripped,
closet cleaned out.

02:15.034 --> 02:16.534
"Kidnapped."

02:16.535 --> 02:19.664
A thief with a sense of humour.

02:23.000 --> 02:25.835
"Dear Mac, if you ever want
to see your fridge alive,

02:25.836 --> 02:28.880
meet me at the west end
of the airport, hangar 13.

02:28.881 --> 02:32.009
Come alone, or the fridge fries."

02:34.720 --> 02:38.264
Some folks might see the humour
in something like this.

02:38.265 --> 02:40.475
I don't happen to be one.

02:40.476 --> 02:43.146
But I knew someone who would:

02:43.437 --> 02:45.940
Jack Dalton.

02:47.483 --> 02:50.652
I hadn't seen Jack Dalton
in almost five years.

02:50.653 --> 02:54.364
He, Mike Forrester and I had
been like the Three Musketeers.

02:54.365 --> 02:59.055
After college, we traipsed
all over Europe together.

03:10.506 --> 03:12.632
You had to give Jack one thing:

03:12.633 --> 03:14.717
He knew how to have fun.

03:14.718 --> 03:18.554
High-adventure, globe-trotting,
no-holds-barred fun.

03:18.555 --> 03:21.557
Tonight it started with looting
my apartment.

03:21.558 --> 03:27.988
And this very convenient open door
told me it wasn't gonna stop there.

03:33.904 --> 03:35.905
Jack Dalton.

03:35.906 --> 03:41.286
Rogue, adventurer, liar, thief.

03:43.163 --> 03:45.331
And there was living proof.

03:45.332 --> 03:47.832
My hockey jersey.

03:51.129 --> 03:55.966
It was starting to look to me like
maybe Jack Dalton had a plan.

03:55.967 --> 03:58.467
Well, so did I.

04:08.605 --> 04:13.567
One might ask how I could be so sure
this was the work of Jack Dalton.

04:13.568 --> 04:17.238
Well, sometimes you just know.

04:23.828 --> 04:26.328
Jack.

04:27.874 --> 04:30.374
Come on, I know it's you.

04:32.212 --> 04:34.712
My stuff.

04:35.340 --> 04:36.840
Jack!

04:36.841 --> 04:40.637
MacGyver, I'm flattered. You came.

04:42.055 --> 04:44.555
I had a choice?

04:45.933 --> 04:47.976
Yo, Mac, where you going?

04:47.977 --> 04:50.479
You're not steamed, are you?
Come on, it was a joke.

04:50.480 --> 04:54.149
First, you're gonna come down here
so I can punch you in the nose.

04:54.150 --> 04:56.109
Then you're gonna Ioad up
all my stuff

04:56.110 --> 04:58.153
and take it back to my place.
You got that?

04:58.154 --> 05:00.989
AII right, I'm sorry. If that's
what you want, I'II put it all back.

05:00.990 --> 05:03.158
- Good.
- Hey, Mac, please, don't go.

05:03.159 --> 05:05.494
Where you going? Mac!
I'm begging you. Mac!

05:05.495 --> 05:07.995
Jack!

05:09.332 --> 05:12.376
You should see your face.

05:12.543 --> 05:16.796
Priceless. Oh, Mac,
you haven't changed. Not a bit.

05:16.797 --> 05:19.549
- Neither have you, Jack.
- Yeah? Thanks.

05:19.550 --> 05:21.343
It wasn't a compliment.

05:21.344 --> 05:23.136
Hey, Mac, you gotta cut me down.
Mac!

05:23.137 --> 05:25.221
Mac, cut me down!

05:25.222 --> 05:29.684
Come on, MacGyver,
my head's about to explode here.

05:29.685 --> 05:31.853
I knew you wouldn't
Ieave me hanging.

05:31.854 --> 05:34.272
You can call me "amigo" anytime.

05:34.273 --> 05:39.486
If there's ever anything I can do
for you, just Iet me know, amigo.

05:39.487 --> 05:42.847
Now, easy, easy.
Hey, watch my head!

05:43.949 --> 05:45.867
Just Iike the tocotines.

05:45.868 --> 05:47.577
In Papantla. Remember, Mac?

05:47.578 --> 05:50.747
When you and Mike and I were
at the festival of Corpus Christi?

05:50.748 --> 05:53.041
AIways wanted to try that.

05:53.042 --> 05:56.210
- What a rush.
- Jack, what do you want?

05:56.211 --> 06:00.089
Right to the point, huh? Good.
We can reminisce Iater. I wanna talk.

06:00.090 --> 06:02.717
I do have a phone.
At Ieast I used to.

06:02.718 --> 06:04.969
Yeah, but I couldn't be sure
you'd come. I need a favour.

06:04.970 --> 06:08.056
- You know how to butter a guy up.
- Look, I got my own company now.

06:08.057 --> 06:11.517
Jack Dalton, sole proprietor,
FIy-by-Night air freight, at your service.

06:11.518 --> 06:16.689
The official airline for slugs, scum and
all manner of vermin. Anyway, I was...

06:16.690 --> 06:20.359
...shall we say, transporting
some very valuable orchids.

06:20.360 --> 06:22.737
Shall we say smuggling?

06:22.738 --> 06:25.238
That's an ugly word, Mac.

06:25.574 --> 06:28.200
But, hey, at 1,000 bucks a plant,
I can Iive with it.

06:28.201 --> 06:30.244
Anyway, you know me.
What do I know about orchids?

06:30.245 --> 06:34.040
Maybe how to spell it.
So I needed expert advice. Botanists.

06:34.041 --> 06:35.750
So where does the favour come in?

06:35.751 --> 06:39.628
A Iittle rescue mission
to save the botanists.

06:39.629 --> 06:42.382
- In Dinoto.
- Dinoto?

06:42.549 --> 06:44.633
As in Central America, Dinoto?

06:44.634 --> 06:46.260
- Yeah. Come on, Mac.
- Yeah.

06:46.261 --> 06:48.971
We can take my plane,
be there in no time. Think about it.

06:48.972 --> 06:52.812
- Adventure. Danger. It'II be fun.
- Jack!

06:52.934 --> 06:55.603
What have these botanists done?

06:55.604 --> 06:58.772
Americans are being snatched
all over the world, Mac.

06:58.773 --> 07:00.941
I mean, you know how it is
with these crazies.

07:00.942 --> 07:04.486
You're Iying, Jack. About what, I don't
know, but you're hiding something.

07:04.487 --> 07:07.031
That hurts me, Mac.
How can you say that?

07:07.032 --> 07:11.076
Your eye. It still twitches
when you're Iying.

07:11.077 --> 07:14.955
Look, I gotta do it, Mac.
It's my fault they're there.

07:14.956 --> 07:18.125
Mac, please, a favour for a friend.
I'm begging you.

07:18.126 --> 07:19.460
Why should I believe you?

07:19.461 --> 07:22.337
You've never been straight
about anything in your whole Iife.

07:22.338 --> 07:25.090
And whatever happened to that
Iooking-out-for-number-one,

07:25.091 --> 07:29.011
cut-your-Iosses-and-get-out-quick
Jack Dalton we all knew and Ioved?

07:29.012 --> 07:33.140
- He's changed.
- Yeah. Wish I could believe that.

07:33.141 --> 07:35.641
I'm dying, Mac.

07:37.729 --> 07:40.648
- What?
- I'm dying.

07:49.824 --> 07:51.700
No joke?

07:51.701 --> 07:53.994
No joke.

07:53.995 --> 07:58.515
And I just wanna do one thing right
before I do.

08:06.215 --> 08:08.758
AII I said, Mac,
was there was a remote chance

08:08.759 --> 08:12.220
that there's an ounce of truth
to his story. That's all.

08:12.221 --> 08:16.099
Our sources do tell us that there's
an American botanist in the country.

08:16.100 --> 08:19.185
So you're telling me
some botanists are missing?

08:19.186 --> 08:22.022
Mac, what makes you think
this isn't one of Jack's lies?

08:22.023 --> 08:24.858
I don't know, Pete.
I think he's telling the truth this time.

08:24.859 --> 08:26.151
Just a feeling.

08:26.152 --> 08:31.072
Well, I don't Iike it. The whole thing
creaks. Makes me nervous.

08:31.073 --> 08:32.782
Careful, Pete, you're on a diet.

08:32.783 --> 08:36.660
You know how you like to eat
when you're nervous.

08:36.662 --> 08:41.166
Listen, Mac, you know there is no way
the Foundation can get involved in this,

08:41.167 --> 08:45.587
but if there's anything that I can do
unofficially, call me, will you?

08:45.588 --> 08:51.050
Thank you for using the telephone.
Your three minutes are up.

08:51.051 --> 08:54.095
So, what's the deal? Papa Thornton
say you can come out and play?

08:54.096 --> 08:55.555
Yeah.

08:55.556 --> 09:01.061
Good. Now we go to plane, kemosabe.
You follow.

09:02.563 --> 09:05.815
I know I said I was gonna slug him.

09:05.816 --> 09:08.316
But how do you hit a kid?

09:36.430 --> 09:40.320
Shouldn't we be using charts
or something?

09:57.951 --> 10:00.161
Charts. Shouldn't we
be using charts?

10:00.162 --> 10:02.538
What's the name
on the plane, Mac?

10:02.539 --> 10:05.039
- FIy-by-Night.
- Exactly.

10:05.125 --> 10:08.295
Now, relax. I know what I'm doing.

10:19.556 --> 10:22.475
- Charts?
- Strongbox.

10:49.502 --> 10:52.255
Hey, you found the pictures.

10:52.422 --> 10:54.673
Where was that one taken again?

10:54.674 --> 10:57.174
Martinique.

10:58.052 --> 11:01.013
That was just before we went diving
off the coral reef.

11:01.014 --> 11:04.808
Oh, right. That was the day we saw
that shark feeding frenzy. Remember?

11:04.809 --> 11:07.562
Remember? You started it.

11:08.104 --> 11:12.524
That was the same day
I cut my air hose on the coral.

11:12.525 --> 11:14.025
You saved my Iife.

11:14.026 --> 11:18.613
Hey, that's what buddies are for.
What else you got there?

11:18.614 --> 11:21.784
It's you, me and Mike in Barbados.

11:22.285 --> 11:24.869
You, me and Mike in Singapore.

11:24.870 --> 11:27.832
You, me and Mike in Fresno.

11:27.999 --> 11:31.669
- Those were good times.
- Yep.

11:32.461 --> 11:35.839
So you seen Mike any Iately? You
always were a Iittle warm for her form.

11:35.840 --> 11:38.258
It's been about four years.

11:38.259 --> 11:41.261
Besides, you were the one
that was always proposing to her.

11:41.262 --> 11:45.849
Yeah, and she'd have said yes if she
didn't think it'd have broke your heart.

11:45.850 --> 11:48.810
Boy, it'd be great to get together again,
just the three of us.

11:48.811 --> 11:51.771
- One Iast great adventure.
- Yeah.

11:51.772 --> 11:54.232
How about you, Jack?

11:54.233 --> 11:56.933
- You seen Mike Iately?
- No.

11:57.903 --> 12:00.403
Been a Iong time.

12:01.240 --> 12:03.740
Long time.

12:09.873 --> 12:12.417
Good morning,
Iadies and gentlemen.

12:12.418 --> 12:15.211
We'd Iike to thank you for flying
FIy-by-Night

12:15.212 --> 12:17.588
and welcome you
to beautiful Dinoto,

12:17.589 --> 12:21.217
where the temperature
is a balmy 83 degrees.

12:21.218 --> 12:23.302
PIease extinguish all
smoking materials

12:23.303 --> 12:26.848
and bring your seatbacks and
tray tables to their full upright position

12:26.849 --> 12:29.058
for Ianding.

12:29.059 --> 12:32.436
Something tells me this isn't
the only airport in town.

12:32.437 --> 12:34.981
Customs can be such a bother,
old boy.

12:34.982 --> 12:37.108
Here we go, hold on.

12:37.109 --> 12:40.278
You know, I feel good about this.
I didn't wanna say anything Iast night,

12:40.279 --> 12:42.196
but I had my doubts
you'd even come.

12:42.197 --> 12:44.615
However, you're here, the sun's up,

12:44.616 --> 12:47.827
it's a new day,
and all's well on God's green earth.

12:47.828 --> 12:50.955
Yes, indeed. We'II be in and out
in no time with my botanists.

12:50.956 --> 12:52.581
Does anyone know
you went for help?

12:52.582 --> 12:55.209
Are you kidding? I slipped out
of here Iike a thief in the night.

12:55.210 --> 12:56.961
No way anybody knows I was gone.

12:56.962 --> 12:59.296
- You sure?
- Positive.

12:59.297 --> 13:01.925
Capitán, capitán, I hear it.

13:05.470 --> 13:08.220
Looks Iike you've been missed.

13:08.682 --> 13:10.766
You wanna tell me what's going on?

13:10.767 --> 13:13.707
Oh, my mistake. Private airstrip.

13:17.274 --> 13:21.360
- Jack, why are the police here?
- I could have sworn I told you.

13:21.361 --> 13:25.114
Those are the guys
we have to save the botanists from.

13:25.115 --> 13:26.949
The police?!

13:26.950 --> 13:29.960
Take it easy, Mac. I got a plan.

14:06.698 --> 14:09.157
Jack, wouldn't you say
we're running out of runway?

14:09.158 --> 14:11.159
You worry too much, Mac.

14:11.160 --> 14:14.150
Sometimes you don't worry enough!

14:14.163 --> 14:16.663
Come on, faster!

14:28.010 --> 14:30.510
Let's get them!

14:35.851 --> 14:39.421
Hang on, Mac,
I'm bringing her around.

14:50.282 --> 14:52.117
What was that?

14:52.118 --> 14:57.038
Tricks of me trade, Mac, me boyo.
Tricks of me trade.

15:03.087 --> 15:04.504
What are you doing?

15:04.505 --> 15:08.415
I'm gonna give them
a burst of fresh air.

15:26.151 --> 15:28.651
They're gaining on us.

15:29.530 --> 15:32.200
Hang on. We're turning again.

16:10.779 --> 16:14.949
Beautiful! Mac, I gotta tell you,
it brought tears to my eyes.

16:14.950 --> 16:21.140
Beautiful. Now, tell me you're not
having just a Iittle bit of fun.

16:30.340 --> 16:33.927
Crack shooting, Antunnez.

16:34.427 --> 16:38.639
You got a bunch of real sharpshooters
on your force.

16:38.640 --> 16:42.101
Perhaps you'd Iike to test
my marksmanship?

16:42.102 --> 16:44.978
That's not just my money
winging its way out of here.

16:44.979 --> 16:47.856
No, you and I
are Iike a team, amigo.

16:47.857 --> 16:52.611
- I Iose, you Iose.
- He will not Ieave without the girl.

16:52.612 --> 16:55.112
We will get your plants.

16:55.740 --> 16:58.860
And then we will kill Jack Dalton.

17:14.342 --> 17:16.175
Jack, why are we going down?

17:16.176 --> 17:18.220
There's nothing but jungle
around here.

17:18.221 --> 17:20.012
I'm gonna put her down right there.

17:20.013 --> 17:22.682
There? Where's "there"?
I don't see a Ianding strip.

17:22.683 --> 17:25.018
Neither do I, it's a cow pasture.

17:25.019 --> 17:27.938
But sometimes sacrifices
have to be made. Hold on.

17:27.939 --> 17:30.929
Hold on, now. Little bump coming.

17:31.776 --> 17:35.320
There we go, another nifty Ianding,
Jack, my boy.

17:35.321 --> 17:38.865
Smooth as a baby's bottom.
Pure as the driven snow.

17:38.866 --> 17:41.701
Jack, would you mind telling me
exactly what's going on?

17:41.702 --> 17:44.371
Exactly what's going on
is a Iittle difficult.

17:44.372 --> 17:46.331
But I'II give you a fair approximation.

17:46.332 --> 17:49.209
I've got a place near here,
a Iittle hideout of sorts.

17:49.210 --> 17:51.336
I Iike to think of it
as my summer home.

17:51.337 --> 17:53.380
Your summer home.
Get much company?

17:53.381 --> 17:55.881
You're the first.

18:04.892 --> 18:07.227
- They hit our fuel tank.
- Not to worry.

18:07.228 --> 18:09.728
Someone has to.

18:24.870 --> 18:31.870
Great job. Put it on my bill. I'II pay
you Iater. Let's get out of here now.

18:47.059 --> 18:49.894
This place always kind of reminds me
of a roach motel for airplanes.

18:49.895 --> 18:52.313
They fly in, but they don't fly out.

18:52.314 --> 18:54.273
Sort of Iike us.

18:54.274 --> 18:56.317
So tell me, who's the happy cop
with the gun?

18:56.318 --> 18:58.110
Antunnez.

18:58.111 --> 19:01.761
- Jack, what's the deal?
- Take a Iook.

19:12.000 --> 19:13.209
Orchids?

19:13.210 --> 19:15.970
Phragmipedium besseae, actually.

19:16.296 --> 19:18.005
Now, Jack, I could be wrong,

19:18.006 --> 19:22.636
but Antunnez does not strike me
as a flower Iover.

19:22.802 --> 19:24.553
Wanna Ievel with me?

19:24.554 --> 19:28.349
I'm kind of tired of being jerked around
Iike a big dog on a short Ieash.

19:28.350 --> 19:34.460
Let it never be said of Jack Dalton
that he was unkind to animals.

19:51.498 --> 19:53.998
Heroin?

19:54.334 --> 19:57.503
You're smuggling heroin?
Of all the stupid, idiotic things, Jack--

19:57.504 --> 20:01.758
I know! It's not my stuff!
Mac, jeez.

20:03.009 --> 20:06.136
For enough grease, Antunnez will Iook
the other way. He did for me,

20:06.137 --> 20:09.056
and he did for the guy whose
heroin this is. Name is Sonny.

20:09.057 --> 20:12.017
- How'd you end up with it?
- He stashed it in my plants.

20:12.018 --> 20:14.311
Antunnez told him I'd fly it back
to the States.

20:14.312 --> 20:16.855
When I found out about it,
I told them to take a hike.

20:16.856 --> 20:19.191
That's when they grabbed Mi--

20:19.192 --> 20:21.692
- My botanist.
- Botanist?

20:21.694 --> 20:23.862
I thought there was more than one.

20:23.863 --> 20:29.743
Botanists. Botanist. Yeah,
I can see how that could be confusing.

20:29.869 --> 20:32.037
Anyway, they thought they could
force my hand.

20:32.038 --> 20:35.373
So you took their drugs, ran to me,
thinking I'd bail you out.

20:35.374 --> 20:36.917
You're the only real friend I got.

20:36.918 --> 20:39.502
So why didn't you just tell me
the whole story?

20:39.503 --> 20:43.965
Right, sure. Drugs, blackmail, corrupt
police. Sounds Iike a bad TV show.

20:43.966 --> 20:46.551
- Wanna know how it ends?
- They all Iive happily ever after?

20:46.552 --> 20:48.928
With me walking out that door
and going for help.

20:48.929 --> 20:52.641
Oh, Mac, come on. Mac.
Mac. Mac, come on.

20:52.642 --> 20:56.269
What about Mike? She'II be dead by
the time you get the help we need.

20:56.270 --> 20:58.770
Mike?

20:58.773 --> 21:00.982
Mike Forrester?

21:00.983 --> 21:03.193
The Mike in those pictures?
Our Mike?

21:03.194 --> 21:07.874
I could have sworn I told you,
Mike's my botanist.

21:08.991 --> 21:13.661
I told you, I'm a botanist.
I don't know where your stuff is.

21:13.662 --> 21:15.663
Okay, come on, babe.

21:15.664 --> 21:20.664
This is getting real old, real fast.
We want our scag.

21:22.546 --> 21:24.380
Okay, okay.

21:24.381 --> 21:30.311
Look, I understand, you might not
wanna deal with this dude here.

21:30.346 --> 21:34.432
But me, hey, I'm an American.
Just the same as you.

21:34.433 --> 21:36.935
You're nothing Iike me.

21:37.936 --> 21:41.147
What kind of an American
would buy off a cop?

21:41.148 --> 21:46.027
And Iet him kick monks out of
their own monastery, all for money?

21:46.028 --> 21:48.668
A guy's gotta have some fun.

21:55.412 --> 21:57.830
I've already told you,

21:57.831 --> 22:03.336
I don't know where your drugs are.
And I don't know where Jack is.

22:03.337 --> 22:05.837
I believe her, Sonny.

22:06.214 --> 22:08.466
Finally.

22:08.467 --> 22:11.697
But she has outlived her usefulness.

22:13.972 --> 22:16.140
It ain't a total wipeout.

22:16.141 --> 22:21.561
A pretty babe Iike her.
I'II bet she's good for something.

22:23.815 --> 22:26.693
Yes, perhaps you're right.

22:37.996 --> 22:42.083
My mother taught me
never to strike a Iady.

22:45.295 --> 22:48.045
I never Iistened to my mother.

22:54.220 --> 22:56.346
You told me you hadn't seen her
in years.

22:56.347 --> 22:58.807
I don't get you. Why all these Iies?

22:58.808 --> 23:01.727
AII you had to do was say that Mike
was in trouble. I'd have come here.

23:01.728 --> 23:03.645
You'd have been mad
and Ieft me in L.A.

23:03.646 --> 23:05.189
You don't think I'm mad now?!

23:05.190 --> 23:08.483
But, Mac, we're here together.
You and me. We're gonna save Mike.

23:08.484 --> 23:14.404
You know, I wonder if you're even
dying, or was that a Iie too?

23:17.035 --> 23:19.453
Sorry.

23:19.454 --> 23:21.330
AII right, where are they
keeping her?

23:21.331 --> 23:25.292
I'm not sure. But don't worry.
I got a plan.

23:25.293 --> 23:27.793
I'II bet.

23:54.405 --> 23:56.823
That's EIena over there.
She runs the place.

23:56.824 --> 23:59.826
- Which one?
- The one in the red, apron, doorway.

23:59.827 --> 24:03.288
She hears all, sees more
and tells Iittle.

24:03.289 --> 24:06.166
Except to moi.
She's a very good friend.

24:06.167 --> 24:08.460
She just might know
where he's keeping her.

24:08.461 --> 24:12.401
And we've gotta get past
those guys first.

24:18.637 --> 24:21.137
Come on.

24:40.743 --> 24:41.951
Antunnez is inside.

24:41.952 --> 24:43.953
- He's Iooking for you.
- Don't I know it.

24:43.954 --> 24:46.414
We gotta find Mike.
Do you know where he's keeping her?

24:46.415 --> 24:48.458
I don't know, but I might know
somebody who does.

24:48.459 --> 24:50.959
Dalton!

25:03.849 --> 25:05.349
- What?
- Look, Iet's split up.

25:05.350 --> 25:07.393
- No use both of us getting caught.
- Both of us?

25:07.394 --> 25:10.164
Don't worry. I've got a plan.

25:45.682 --> 25:48.435
Some plan, Jack.

26:07.495 --> 26:11.874
So Jack wanted to get caught?
What kind of plan is that?

26:11.875 --> 26:13.917
A dumb one.

26:13.918 --> 26:16.753
He probably figured
he'd be thrown in with Mike.

26:16.754 --> 26:19.381
Probably also figured
I'd go after him too.

26:19.382 --> 26:23.385
Did he also figure
you would save them both?

26:23.386 --> 26:26.264
Jack operates a Iot on faith.

26:27.056 --> 26:30.934
Any idea why Antunnez threw him
in the monastery instead of his jail?

26:30.935 --> 26:32.728
Privacy.

26:32.729 --> 26:36.398
The colonel doesn't Iike to mix
business with pleasure.

26:36.399 --> 26:38.899
Anybody else ever get in?

26:39.402 --> 26:43.864
Except once. A few weeks ago,
the monks had a funeral.

26:43.865 --> 26:47.076
That's where their mausoleum is.

26:47.243 --> 26:49.953
I'm sorry I can't help you more.

26:49.954 --> 26:52.915
Oh, don't worry. I have a plan.

26:53.499 --> 26:56.589
I can't believe I just said that.

27:06.012 --> 27:10.014
I do and do and do for you guys,
and this is the thanks I get?

27:10.015 --> 27:11.933
Oh, go ahead. Crack wise, sport.

27:11.934 --> 27:18.304
You got one day to tell me where
my stuff is, or you're both vapour.

27:23.112 --> 27:24.612
Jack, are you all right?

27:24.613 --> 27:28.324
I haven't felt this good
in a Iong time. I feel alive.

27:28.325 --> 27:29.909
You Iook terrible.

27:29.910 --> 27:33.913
Oh, right, well,
thanks for the cheer-up, ducky.

27:33.914 --> 27:36.499
Why don't you just tell them
where the heroin is?

27:36.500 --> 27:38.334
Because it's wrong.

27:38.335 --> 27:41.087
And it's the only reason
we're still alive.

27:41.088 --> 27:43.047
Don't worry.
We're getting out of here.

27:43.048 --> 27:45.383
- It'II take a miracle.
- We got it.

27:45.384 --> 27:46.926
- MacGyver.
- Here?

27:46.927 --> 27:51.305
You bet. AII I had to say was, "Mike's
in trouble," and, bingo, there he was.

27:51.306 --> 27:54.475
- Mac.
- Yeah, all we gotta do is sit tight.

27:54.476 --> 27:58.272
Mac'II get us out.
Does this Iook bad?

28:01.108 --> 28:03.608
Bad.

28:27.968 --> 28:31.513
Yo, gentlemen.
Eyes front and centre.

28:31.680 --> 28:34.807
I must say, I'm surprised
to see you all here.

28:34.808 --> 28:38.298
I was not aware
of any recent deaths.

28:38.937 --> 28:45.707
But how rude of me. Where there is
a coffin, there must surely be a body.

28:48.530 --> 28:51.030
Put the coffin down here.

29:12.679 --> 29:19.309
I have interfered enough with this poor
soul's journey to his final resting place.

29:19.310 --> 29:24.857
Perhaps I can ensure
the dearly departed

29:25.275 --> 29:29.405
of a speedy arrival
at his final destination.

29:40.748 --> 29:43.248
Now...

29:43.543 --> 29:46.043
...you may bury your dead.

31:33.944 --> 31:36.614
Hey, what are you doing here?

31:48.166 --> 31:51.669
I'd never been one
to give much thought to what I wore,

31:51.670 --> 31:57.040
but a guy could get attached
to this outfit after a while.

31:58.259 --> 32:03.909
Multipurpose clerical wear.
Something useful for every occasion.

32:06.434 --> 32:09.824
Especially for staying out of trouble.

32:17.612 --> 32:21.073
Oh, I got it! "Breast-fed babies
are the best-fed babies."

32:21.074 --> 32:24.244
- No.
- No? Damn.

32:24.702 --> 32:28.482
Then I'd Iike to buy
another vowel, Pat.

32:29.832 --> 32:32.332
- Hi, kids.
- Mac!

32:34.587 --> 32:39.007
- I can't believe you're here.
- That makes two of us. Hi, baby.

32:39.008 --> 32:41.093
Why is it every time
you wish you had your camera,

32:41.094 --> 32:46.223
you remember you Ieft it in another
country? Whenever you're ready.

32:46.224 --> 32:49.684
Hey, what's the deal?
You wear pants under those, or what?

32:49.685 --> 32:51.520
No pants?

32:51.521 --> 32:56.281
I think we ought to hightail it
out of here, Padre.

33:18.255 --> 33:19.506
- Look.
- What?

33:19.507 --> 33:20.799
- The truck.
- What?

33:20.800 --> 33:24.080
- The truck.
- The truck. Let's go.

33:45.574 --> 33:49.674
I'm gonna need something
to carry a current.

33:51.497 --> 33:55.257
- Here.
- Oh, you guys are good together.

34:06.637 --> 34:08.804
I've put a Iot of effort into this,
Antunnez.

34:08.806 --> 34:11.516
But it's all a waste of time
if Dalton doesn't talk.

34:11.516 --> 34:17.417
But he will talk, or watch the girl die
a most unpleasant death.

34:33.621 --> 34:36.121
You guys still need me.

34:51.848 --> 34:54.348
Move it, come on!

35:06.821 --> 35:11.575
Tu, my man, it Iooks Iike it's time
for another funeral. Yours.

35:11.576 --> 35:14.620
Don't worry. There's only one way
for them to Ieave this country:

35:14.621 --> 35:16.497
Their plane.

35:16.498 --> 35:18.998
And I have it covered.

35:35.767 --> 35:38.770
I'd say we hoof it from here.

35:44.317 --> 35:46.151
Jack?

35:46.152 --> 35:52.292
What? What? Can't a guy show
a Iittle appreciation for his freedom?

35:52.784 --> 35:55.284
Help me up, would you?

35:55.453 --> 35:57.788
- You all right?
- I'm okay.

35:57.789 --> 36:00.289
- You sure?
- I'm sure.

36:07.798 --> 36:10.426
So much for a clean getaway.

36:10.843 --> 36:13.261
Well, it's just as well it worked out
this way, I suppose.

36:13.262 --> 36:15.805
- That plane wasn't going anywhere.
- Say what?

36:15.806 --> 36:19.059
Remember, we got hit
when we came in? Lost all that fuel?

36:19.060 --> 36:20.977
Well, I checked the gauges.

36:20.978 --> 36:24.522
Way I figure it, we take off in that
plane, one of two things can happen.

36:24.523 --> 36:28.526
One, we can fly about five miles
and crash into the mountains.

36:28.527 --> 36:32.781
Or two, we can fly about five miles
and crash into the ocean.

36:32.782 --> 36:34.866
Nice to have options.

36:34.867 --> 36:38.887
Oh, you know, Mac,
some days are Iike that.

36:39.872 --> 36:42.665
- Oh, is this great, or what?
- What?

36:42.666 --> 36:47.755
Us. Together again.
Just Iike the Monkees.

36:47.963 --> 36:50.340
The good old days. Remember?

36:50.341 --> 36:53.009
Forgive me for being a wet blanket,
but I'd feel a whole Iot better

36:53.010 --> 36:55.637
if we could take this reunion tour
on the road.

36:55.638 --> 36:58.265
Mike, Mike.

36:58.432 --> 36:59.682
Don't worry. I've got--

36:59.683 --> 37:02.518
- "I have a plan."
- "I have a plan."

37:02.519 --> 37:04.854
- Do I say that a Iot?
- Yeah.

37:04.855 --> 37:07.865
Well, I got a plan too. Come on.

37:10.569 --> 37:12.862
We need the plane,
and we need time to fix it.

37:12.863 --> 37:14.906
We need to get Antunnez's men
away from it.

37:14.907 --> 37:16.699
Yeah, that's where you come in, son.

37:16.700 --> 37:20.161
Give us half an hour, and then bring
Antunnez and Sonny to your junkyard.

37:20.162 --> 37:21.370
And then?

37:21.371 --> 37:23.539
We'II have a Iittle surprise
made up for them.

37:23.540 --> 37:24.874
What'II I use for bait?

37:24.875 --> 37:28.377
Tell Antunnez we'II trade his drugs
for your plane.

37:28.378 --> 37:30.463
Jack's plane's worthless right now.

37:30.464 --> 37:32.882
You know that, I know that,
Jack knows that.

37:32.883 --> 37:34.133
- I Iike your style.
- Yeah.

37:34.134 --> 37:36.804
- See you Iater.
- Let's go.

37:47.898 --> 37:49.565
Is that the heroin?

37:49.566 --> 37:52.766
Good, just put it down right there.

37:53.987 --> 37:57.907
Hope Jack doesn't object. I dug
into his private stock of cheap wine.

37:57.908 --> 37:59.116
I don't know, Mac.

37:59.117 --> 38:02.661
I usually use a white wine
to charge my dead batteries.

38:02.662 --> 38:04.830
Actually, vinegar works better.

38:04.831 --> 38:07.750
But there's enough acid in this stuff
to act as a catalyst,

38:07.751 --> 38:12.463
so I think Jack's wine
comes close enough. Come on.

38:12.464 --> 38:19.054
Besides, we only need charge enough
to turn this prop a couple of times.

38:29.439 --> 38:33.809
- That's great. Like a better mousetrap.
- Yeah.

38:33.943 --> 38:36.195
Now what?

38:36.196 --> 38:39.907
Now all we have to do is
camouflage the tarpaulin,

38:39.908 --> 38:42.367
check the starter here
back to the wine battery

38:42.368 --> 38:45.622
and cover up the rope with vines.

38:49.375 --> 38:51.875
We need stuff Iike this.

39:07.477 --> 39:09.977
What's this for?

39:16.485 --> 39:19.575
It's good to see you again, Mike.

39:45.181 --> 39:48.516
How do you guys do it? Pummel me
all night, shoot at me in the morning,

39:48.517 --> 39:51.352
steal my plane in the afternoon
and still not a hair out of place.

39:51.353 --> 39:52.896
You feel Iike praying a Iittle?

39:52.897 --> 39:57.150
Take it easy on me, man. You never
gonna see your drugs no more, man.

39:57.151 --> 40:00.862
I don't think that would be
a very wise idea.

40:00.863 --> 40:03.363
No more games, Dalton.

40:03.532 --> 40:06.032
No more games?

40:07.244 --> 40:09.864
Then how about a proposition?

40:23.177 --> 40:25.721
AII right, here we go.

40:28.181 --> 40:31.559
It's a nice place.
You and the rest of the garbage.

40:31.560 --> 40:34.562
I see you have finally decided
to be civil.

40:34.563 --> 40:36.272
How very wise of you.

40:36.273 --> 40:38.733
Enough small talk.
Where's our smack?

40:38.734 --> 40:41.902
It's by the plane.
Let me get it for you.

40:41.903 --> 40:43.946
Not without company.

40:43.947 --> 40:46.447
Let's all go.

40:46.783 --> 40:49.283
Okay.

40:58.003 --> 40:59.587
- Hold it.
- Antunnez!

40:59.588 --> 41:01.255
That's enough.

41:01.256 --> 41:04.466
Antunnez, help.
Get me down from here now!

41:04.467 --> 41:06.967
Antunnez. Antunnez!

41:10.473 --> 41:12.973
The heroin.

41:13.059 --> 41:15.939
Well, it's not quite that easy.

41:18.565 --> 41:20.691
You'd Ieave an awful Iot
of Ioose ends.

41:20.692 --> 41:23.027
You are drug smugglers.
I am the Iaw.

41:23.028 --> 41:25.571
And you will not be alive
to say otherwise.

41:25.572 --> 41:28.407
Now, wait a minute. I got a plan.
You want the smack, right?

41:28.408 --> 41:31.285
Here's what you do. Let them go,
and you and I boogie with the booty.

41:31.286 --> 41:35.122
- Jack, what are you doing?
- I'II ask the questions.

41:35.123 --> 41:37.875
And what do I need you for,
Mr. Dalton?

41:37.876 --> 41:40.210
Because Iike it or not,
if they find our bodies down here,

41:40.211 --> 41:42.296
our government's going to
make sure your government

41:42.297 --> 41:44.797
makes it very hard on you.

41:44.966 --> 41:48.302
Americans are funny that way.
They take care of their own, Iike family.

41:48.303 --> 41:51.972
That'II make it very difficult for you to
move that smack, even if you have it.

41:51.973 --> 41:55.684
- That's where I come in.
- Where you come in?

41:55.685 --> 41:58.185
I've got a plane.

41:58.646 --> 42:00.814
I can fly.

42:00.815 --> 42:03.315
You can't.

42:03.484 --> 42:06.195
You'd be so rich.

42:06.362 --> 42:10.116
Tax-free American dollars. Power.

42:11.409 --> 42:16.705
And all you gotta do is Iet them Iive.
What's that to you?

42:16.706 --> 42:18.164
Touch them, you go nowhere.

42:18.165 --> 42:21.001
- Jack, this is crazy, I can't Iet--
- Mac.

42:21.002 --> 42:24.546
I got you two into this.
The Ieast I can do is get you out of it.

42:24.547 --> 42:28.647
What do you say, colonel?
Best deal in town.

42:30.177 --> 42:33.138
We have an agreement, Mr. Dalton.

42:33.139 --> 42:35.639
You two, over there.

42:36.142 --> 42:38.642
Tie them up, and Iet's go.

42:42.189 --> 42:44.232
Jack, what the heck are you doing?

42:44.233 --> 42:49.573
The minute you take off in that plane,
you're a dead man.

42:55.286 --> 42:58.204
I meant what I said
about family, Mac.

42:58.205 --> 43:00.999
You and Mike are family to me.

43:01.000 --> 43:03.835
You really are dying, aren't you?

43:03.836 --> 43:05.837
We're all dying, Mac.

43:05.838 --> 43:09.966
Some of us are just doing it
a Iittle faster than others, that's all.

43:09.967 --> 43:12.467
Jack...

43:12.594 --> 43:15.094
...is that true?

43:22.729 --> 43:24.063
Dalton.

43:24.064 --> 43:25.982
Take care of each other, will you?

43:25.983 --> 43:28.923
- The drugs.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

43:37.744 --> 43:40.244
Dalton.

43:50.048 --> 43:57.048
Come on, Mike, hurry. There's no way
I'm gonna Iet him go through with this.

44:03.603 --> 44:06.103
Don't drop it.

44:16.908 --> 44:19.408
Go.

44:53.569 --> 44:58.991
It's been said the best gift a man
could ever give another was his life.

44:58.992 --> 45:03.036
Jack Dalton was never one
to settle for less than the best.

45:03.037 --> 45:05.537
Thank you, Jack.

45:37.363 --> 45:40.365
I don't know what Iine Jack used
to bring you down to Dinoto,

45:40.366 --> 45:42.367
but I'm sure glad it worked.

45:42.368 --> 45:45.495
Actually, it was the truth
that clinched it.

45:45.496 --> 45:47.789
You knew Jack was dying.

45:47.790 --> 45:49.874
Yeah.

45:49.875 --> 45:52.043
I wonder why he never told me.

45:52.044 --> 45:54.671
Well, you know Jack.
No time for sympathy.

45:54.672 --> 45:57.550
Yeah, too busy Iiving Iife.

45:57.716 --> 46:00.176
Searching for that
greatest adventure.

46:00.177 --> 46:03.587
Having a Iot of fun with his friends.

46:08.644 --> 46:12.855
Yeah, all right, thanks.
Keep me posted, will you?

46:12.856 --> 46:15.358
The Columbian navy picked up
Antunnez.

46:15.359 --> 46:19.070
He washed ashore,
still holding on to his dope.

46:19.071 --> 46:22.073
At Ieast that should guarantee
a conviction.

46:22.074 --> 46:25.410
Well, Antunnez claims he bailed out
when he saw both engines smoking.

46:25.411 --> 46:27.120
Says the plane was going down.

46:27.121 --> 46:29.247
He hit the water, went under,

46:29.248 --> 46:32.750
and when he came up, there was
no sign of the plane. Or Jack.

46:32.751 --> 46:35.251
Both engines smoking.

46:35.671 --> 46:38.965
Tricks of me trade, me boyo.
Tricks of me trade.

46:38.966 --> 46:40.424
What?

46:40.425 --> 46:42.760
You don't suppose he had a plan?

46:42.761 --> 46:45.137
But Jack said he only had
enough fuel for five miles.

46:45.138 --> 46:46.931
Yeah. And when was the Iast time

46:46.932 --> 46:51.032
Jack didn't stretch the truth
just a Iittle?
