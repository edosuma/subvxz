WEBVTT

00:00.967 --> 00:02.768
You're watching The Simpsons.

00:02.770 --> 00:05.771
You know your life sucks.
Just get drunk
like you always do.

00:05.773 --> 00:08.540
Catch all-new episodes Sundays
and check out
our other Fox programs--

00:08.542 --> 00:11.610
Brooklyn Nine-Nine,
Bob's Burgers <i>and</i> Family Guy.

00:11.612 --> 00:14.513
What is this,
and how can I make the rest
of my life about it?

00:14.515 --> 00:15.748
Only on Fox.

00:26.126 --> 00:27.559
Okay, Homie,

00:27.561 --> 00:28.994
I'm plugging it in.

00:28.996 --> 00:30.329
Wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait!

00:30.331 --> 00:32.798
The gravestones could be
a little more crooked.

00:32.800 --> 00:34.133
Oh!

00:34.135 --> 00:36.468
Let me just fluff up
these entrails.

00:36.470 --> 00:38.070
And...

00:38.072 --> 00:39.138
light it up.

00:40.140 --> 00:41.306
(wolf howls)

00:41.308 --> 00:43.242
Bleh, bleh, bleh,
bleh, bleh, bleh.

00:43.244 --> 00:45.177
Halloween at
the Simpsons'.

00:45.179 --> 00:46.478
What a classic
tradition!

00:46.480 --> 00:48.080
Are you heading up
to the tree house

00:48.082 --> 00:50.149
to tell three
horrifying tales?

00:50.151 --> 00:51.683
Ah, we're doing it
next week.

00:51.685 --> 00:54.153
It's gonna be <i>Psycho</i>
<i>with Skinner and his mom,</i>

00:54.155 --> 00:56.755
Muppet <i>Wizard of Oz--</i>
<i>I'm Scarecrow-Fozzie--</i>

00:56.757 --> 00:59.992
and then, uh,
one where furniture gets smart

00:59.994 --> 01:01.693
and takes over the world
or something.

01:01.695 --> 01:03.362
Mmm!
Sounds chilling!

01:03.364 --> 01:04.830
Eh. People love it.

01:04.832 --> 01:07.399
Everscream Terrors
looks amazing this year.

01:07.401 --> 01:10.702
I've never seen black cats
with such arched backs.

01:10.704 --> 01:12.204
Well, you gotta bring it.

01:12.206 --> 01:14.540
Halloweening your house
is a dying art.

01:14.542 --> 01:17.342
More and more people are turning
off their porch lights

01:17.344 --> 01:20.212
and pretending they're not home.

01:20.214 --> 01:22.347
Halloween skippers.

01:22.349 --> 01:23.382
Skippers!

01:23.384 --> 01:25.050
How can you reject a holiday

01:25.052 --> 01:28.187
where you can serve candy
from a salad bowl?

01:28.189 --> 01:29.288
Bad news, Dad.

01:29.290 --> 01:30.789
You stored the plastic skeletons

01:30.791 --> 01:32.191
too close to the furnace.

01:32.193 --> 01:34.293
Eh, I'll take it
to the old folks' home

01:34.295 --> 01:36.361
and tell Grampa
it's his new roommate.

01:36.363 --> 01:37.396
Everyone in the car!

01:37.398 --> 01:38.964
We're making a skeleton run

01:38.966 --> 01:40.365
to the Halloween pop-up store.

01:40.367 --> 01:42.201
Ooh, while we're there,

01:42.203 --> 01:43.936
we can get a costume
for the dog.

01:43.938 --> 01:45.404
Nothing says you love a pet

01:45.406 --> 01:47.940
like letting him be part
of the human fun.

01:47.942 --> 01:50.042
Who wants to be a Yoda?

01:50.044 --> 01:52.377
You want
to be a Yoda!

01:53.580 --> 01:55.447
Ooh.

01:55.449 --> 01:56.849
Ooh!

01:58.151 --> 02:00.419
Oh, man, I can't
wait for tonight!

02:00.421 --> 02:01.653
I'm finally
old enough

02:01.655 --> 02:03.655
for Krustyland
Halloween Horror Night.

02:03.657 --> 02:05.290
Oh, yeah, they do it up right.

02:05.292 --> 02:06.892
Wait till you try
the black cotton candy.

02:06.894 --> 02:09.294
It tastes
just like cotton candy.

02:09.296 --> 02:11.430
Tomorrow, when my friends
ask me about it,

02:11.432 --> 02:14.333
I'm gonna say, "Eh, it wasn't
that big a deal."

02:14.335 --> 02:17.269
But it's gonna be
a really, really big deal!

02:17.271 --> 02:20.839
Welcome, seasonal customer,
to my pop-up emporium.

02:20.841 --> 02:23.442
Behold my terrifying
joke name.

02:23.444 --> 02:24.610
A-boo!

02:24.612 --> 02:28.113
Hmm, you know, I actually
like that better.

02:28.115 --> 02:29.581
Hey, hey!

02:29.583 --> 02:30.849
Why are you
not working?!

02:30.851 --> 02:32.651
'Cause I'm still coming down

02:32.653 --> 02:37.089
from huffing
all that glow stick juice, man.

02:37.091 --> 02:40.425
Oh, I'm strung out
on silly string.

02:40.427 --> 02:42.594
(sneezes)

02:42.596 --> 02:43.862
(groans)

02:43.864 --> 02:45.464
Go, go! Back to work!

02:45.466 --> 02:47.633
Go de-tangle
the novelty cobwebs,

02:47.635 --> 02:50.102
you lazy trick-or-treat trash.

02:50.104 --> 02:52.938
(muttering indistinctly)

02:52.940 --> 02:55.107
Aren't you being
a little hard on them?

02:55.109 --> 02:56.441
Mrs. Simpson,

02:56.443 --> 02:57.943
these are pop-up people.

02:57.945 --> 03:00.879
Temporary workers
who drift from town to town,

03:00.881 --> 03:02.514
holiday to holiday,

03:02.516 --> 03:05.684
living off candy hearts
and sleeping on Easter grass.

03:05.686 --> 03:07.853
If I do not show them
a firm hand,

03:07.855 --> 03:10.489
they would rob me like
Striped Hamburger Thief

03:10.491 --> 03:12.658
robs Restaurant Meat Clown.

03:12.660 --> 03:14.459
♪

03:14.461 --> 03:16.528
Ooh! Mariachi skeletons.

03:16.530 --> 03:20.132
They're spooky, but they also
teach you about Mexico.

03:20.134 --> 03:23.235
Psst! Hey, big man,
how about this deal:

03:23.237 --> 03:26.305
you buy one from me--
in cash--

03:26.307 --> 03:30.175
and I'll load three more
into your car for free.

03:30.177 --> 03:31.643
That is a great deal.

03:31.645 --> 03:34.146
Just don't tell Old
Man Squishee about it.

03:34.148 --> 03:35.547
Hmm.

03:36.516 --> 03:39.318
(grunting and chuckling)

03:39.320 --> 03:41.720
You got some great guys
working here.

03:41.722 --> 03:43.922
They just gave me
a really good deal.

03:43.924 --> 03:45.324
Really?

03:45.326 --> 03:46.858
Tell me of this deal.

03:46.860 --> 03:49.661
Okay, but don't tell
Old Man Squishee about it.

03:49.663 --> 03:51.663
We hate him.

03:51.665 --> 03:53.565
Get out. Out, all of you!

03:53.567 --> 03:55.367
Pop-up scum! Out!

03:55.369 --> 03:58.670
No one rips off
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon!

03:58.672 --> 04:02.074
Now take your suspiciously full
duffle bags and go!

04:03.943 --> 04:07.079
You're gonna be real sorry
for getting us fired.

04:07.081 --> 04:08.747
Well, I'm sorry now.

04:08.749 --> 04:11.083
Yeah, you're gonna be.

04:11.085 --> 04:13.218
I said, I'm sorry now.

04:13.220 --> 04:16.388
We said,
you're gonna be!

04:16.390 --> 04:19.024
I know when I'm sorry,
and I'm sorry now!

04:19.026 --> 04:21.326
You guys don't know me at all.

04:24.097 --> 04:26.365
(Krusty laughing spookily
over speakers)

04:26.367 --> 04:29.301
KRUSTY: Hand stamp required
for re-entry!

04:29.303 --> 04:31.737
(laughing spookily)

04:31.739 --> 04:33.538
That's not scary.

04:33.540 --> 04:35.140
I thought this was
gonna be scary.

04:35.142 --> 04:36.808
(giggles)

04:36.810 --> 04:38.577
(grunts)

04:38.579 --> 04:40.579
(growls)

04:40.581 --> 04:42.714
Scary!

04:42.716 --> 04:45.150
That's really,
uh, anatomical.

04:45.152 --> 04:46.918
Lot of anatomy there.

04:46.920 --> 04:49.488
Oh, yeah,
the gore is super realistic.

04:49.490 --> 04:53.392
It's gotta be-- today's consumer
is just too sophisticated.

04:53.394 --> 04:54.426
(growling)

04:54.428 --> 04:58.130
(screaming)

04:58.132 --> 05:00.132
(screams loudly)

05:00.134 --> 05:03.168
I want to go home!
I want to go home!

05:03.170 --> 05:04.436
What? No!

05:04.438 --> 05:05.771
We just got here!

05:05.773 --> 05:08.473
Lisa, honey,
I think you should stay.

05:08.475 --> 05:11.610
And not because the tickets
were super expensive,

05:11.612 --> 05:15.614
even though they were
<i>super</i> expensive.

05:15.616 --> 05:18.350
But remember, you were
really looking forward

05:18.352 --> 05:20.419
to the fun of being scared by

05:20.421 --> 05:22.854
stuff you know isn't real.
(gasps)

05:22.856 --> 05:26.625
Unlike the money I spent
on this, which is very real.

05:26.627 --> 05:28.360
Okay.

05:28.362 --> 05:30.662
Okay, I'll give it another try.

05:30.664 --> 05:32.631
Good, now take my hand

05:32.633 --> 05:35.000
and I'll walk you through
this roiling zombie horde.

05:35.002 --> 05:36.601
(zombies moaning)

05:36.603 --> 05:38.370
This isn't real.

05:38.372 --> 05:40.605
This isn't real.
This isn't real.

05:40.607 --> 05:42.274
This isn't real.

05:42.276 --> 05:43.542
(gasps)

05:43.544 --> 05:46.278
(Lisa screams in distance)

05:46.280 --> 05:48.980
Sir? Sir?

05:48.982 --> 05:51.216
I-I'm not...
Hold on, Lisa,

05:51.218 --> 05:53.018
Daddy's picking out
a pretzel topping.

05:53.020 --> 05:54.486
Sir?

05:54.488 --> 05:55.487
Oh...

05:55.489 --> 05:57.055
Oh, no, I'm lost!

05:57.057 --> 05:58.490
Okay, find a grown-up.

05:58.492 --> 06:00.292
Find a grown-up.

06:00.294 --> 06:02.461
Excuse me,
I'm lost.

06:02.463 --> 06:04.463
Could you please
help me...

06:04.465 --> 06:05.931
(screams)

06:07.233 --> 06:08.633
I can't find
my family

06:08.635 --> 06:09.901
and I'm really
scared and I...

06:09.903 --> 06:11.603
(screams)

06:13.039 --> 06:15.907
(zombies moaning)

06:18.544 --> 06:20.278
(gasps)

06:24.817 --> 06:26.451
(mumbling deliriously)

06:28.254 --> 06:31.323
Sir, looks like we've got
a scaredy-pants situation here.

06:31.325 --> 06:32.991
Zoom in and scan for fear.

06:34.026 --> 06:36.528
Terror level seven
and rising.

06:36.530 --> 06:38.163
Shut it down.
Shut it all down.

06:38.165 --> 06:40.932
Shut the whole damn thing down!

06:44.937 --> 06:46.371
SUPERVISOR:
Attention!

06:46.373 --> 06:48.573
Bring all laughter
and exhilaration

06:48.575 --> 06:50.442
to a complete stop.

06:50.444 --> 06:54.679
The terrifying good time
is on hold.

06:54.681 --> 06:56.515
We have located and are removing

06:56.517 --> 06:58.383
the baby that thinks
this is real.

06:58.385 --> 07:00.685
Reset time is 65 minutes.

07:00.687 --> 07:02.087
(groaning, grumbling)

07:02.089 --> 07:03.755
All parking validations
are now void.

07:03.757 --> 07:05.724
(grumbling)

07:05.726 --> 07:08.460
Sir...

07:08.462 --> 07:10.262
(whimpering)

07:10.264 --> 07:11.663
(crying)

07:17.069 --> 07:19.304
Mm-hmm.

07:19.306 --> 07:20.572
Lisa, aren't you
going to wear

07:20.574 --> 07:22.474
your costume
to school?

07:22.476 --> 07:25.277
No, I'm not doing
Halloween this year.

07:25.279 --> 07:28.113
Oh, sweetie, I know you
had a scare last night,

07:28.115 --> 07:31.616
but you worked so hard on
your Frida Kahlo outfit.

07:31.618 --> 07:33.718
Maybe just wear the
eyebrow and mustache?

07:33.720 --> 07:34.753
No!

07:34.755 --> 07:36.755
No!

07:36.757 --> 07:38.590
You kids look great.

07:38.592 --> 07:40.592
Delightful.

07:40.594 --> 07:42.327
No place like home.
(chuckles)

07:42.329 --> 07:43.795
Hold on, Simpson.

07:43.797 --> 07:46.565
Let's take a look
at that buccaneer costume.

07:46.567 --> 07:47.999
No weapons, of course.

07:48.001 --> 07:50.602
Bandana, possible gang wear.

07:50.604 --> 07:52.771
Eye patch, offensive
to the half-blind.

07:52.773 --> 07:54.139
Oh, and just to reassure

07:54.141 --> 07:55.507
those who are
afraid of pirates...

07:56.576 --> 07:58.009
(groans)

07:58.978 --> 08:00.679
(gasps, shudders)

08:05.785 --> 08:06.651
(gasps)

08:10.356 --> 08:12.190
(gasps)

08:14.260 --> 08:15.260
(screams)

08:15.262 --> 08:16.595
No! Leave me alone!

08:16.597 --> 08:18.797
Leave me alone!

08:18.799 --> 08:20.866
(panting)

08:25.771 --> 08:26.872
Lisa.

08:29.642 --> 08:33.545
(gasping)

08:33.547 --> 08:35.947
(shuddering)

08:35.949 --> 08:40.051
Homer, I think we should
take down Everscream Terrors.

08:40.053 --> 08:42.821
Wha-- W-We... we can't!

08:42.823 --> 08:45.156
I'm the Mozart
of Halloween decorations,

08:45.158 --> 08:46.825
and tonight is the Super Bowl.

08:46.827 --> 08:48.660
Lisa's in a bad place.

08:48.662 --> 08:50.829
You know how sensitive she is.

08:50.831 --> 08:52.831
We don't want her
to go back to...

08:52.833 --> 08:54.366
Tailee.

08:54.368 --> 08:55.634
No, she wouldn't.

08:55.636 --> 08:56.635
She couldn't.

08:56.637 --> 08:57.969
Not Tailee.

08:57.971 --> 09:00.105
Where is she?

09:01.040 --> 09:02.707
(both gasp)

09:03.676 --> 09:05.977
HOMER:
Oh. Oh.

09:05.979 --> 09:06.978
Ah, let's see.

09:06.980 --> 09:08.413
(gasps)

09:08.415 --> 09:09.648
Oh, God.

09:09.650 --> 09:11.216
We're too late.

09:11.218 --> 09:13.818
The glue stick didn't hold.

09:15.888 --> 09:17.989
So, Tailee's back.

09:17.991 --> 09:19.658
Hmm.

09:19.660 --> 09:21.760
Tailee just makes me
feel so safe.

09:21.762 --> 09:23.695
I don't know why
I ever gave it up.

09:23.697 --> 09:26.831
Breaks my heart that Lisa
can't deal with her emotions

09:26.833 --> 09:28.099
without a crutch.

09:28.101 --> 09:30.302
Well, kids are
weak, Marge.

09:31.837 --> 09:32.938
Oh, yeah.

09:34.206 --> 09:35.607
No. No!

09:35.609 --> 09:36.775
Stop it!

09:36.777 --> 09:39.244
Why are you taking down
Everscream Terrors?

09:39.246 --> 09:42.681
Our house has to be
a Halloween-free zone.

09:42.683 --> 09:45.684
Your sister has a tummy ache
in her courage.

09:45.686 --> 09:47.018
What?

09:47.020 --> 09:49.287
Lisa goes nuts,
and you turn us into...

09:49.289 --> 09:50.922
into skippers?!

09:50.924 --> 09:52.891
I know what this makes us.

09:52.893 --> 09:54.859
I know!

09:54.861 --> 09:56.361
Honey, I knew
you'd be upset,

09:56.363 --> 09:58.897
and that you'd think
only of yourself.

09:58.899 --> 10:01.032
So I'm taking you
to the best

10:01.034 --> 10:02.567
trick-or-treating
block party

10:02.569 --> 10:04.903

10:04.905 --> 10:07.539
There's a dad
who's a deejay.

10:07.541 --> 10:09.874
Even an E.T. who
says your name.

10:09.876 --> 10:12.911
What if I tell the E.T.
my name is a swear?

10:12.913 --> 10:14.145
He'll have to say it.

10:14.147 --> 10:15.647
Then I'm in.

10:17.750 --> 10:19.818

10:30.563 --> 10:32.931
Okay, sweetie,

10:32.933 --> 10:36.301
just you and me spending
a regular eve together.

10:36.303 --> 10:37.836
Nothing hallows
about it.

10:37.838 --> 10:40.472
I'm sorry
I ruined Halloween, Dad.

10:40.474 --> 10:41.940
(scoffs)
Ruined?

10:41.942 --> 10:45.143
Why, you just created
a new holiday...

10:45.145 --> 10:47.278
Puzzle Wednesday.

10:47.280 --> 10:50.081
A tabby and a calico.

10:50.083 --> 10:53.084

to be that ribbon.

10:53.086 --> 10:54.819

10:54.821 --> 10:56.187
Oh, trick-or-treaters.

10:56.189 --> 10:58.156
Don't worry, I'll
get rid of them.

10:59.358 --> 11:00.925
Trick or treat.

11:00.927 --> 11:01.760
Porch light's off, kids.

11:01.762 --> 11:03.161
Don't you know what that means?

11:03.163 --> 11:06.097
We're not here
for candy, big man.

11:06.099 --> 11:08.600
Hey, you're those
pop-up scuzzos.

11:08.602 --> 11:10.101
What do you scuzzos want?

11:10.103 --> 11:12.103
We want our jobs back.

11:12.105 --> 11:13.872
Look, I don't want to be rude,

11:13.874 --> 11:17.709
but you sad losers should
go suck somewhere else.

11:17.711 --> 11:19.177
Uh, uh...

11:19.179 --> 11:21.713
That? (chuckles):
Oh, that was just

11:21.715 --> 11:23.982
a kindly priest here
to bless our home.

11:23.984 --> 11:25.884
I told him to keep moving.

11:25.886 --> 11:27.118
(doorbell rings, Lisa whimpers)

11:27.120 --> 11:28.820
(chuckles nervously):
Hey.

11:28.822 --> 11:30.722
Another visitor?

11:30.724 --> 11:32.657
Isn't life funny and safe?

11:32.659 --> 11:34.826
Can't you jerks take a hint?!

11:34.828 --> 11:36.394

12:01.655 --> 12:04.656
Too many randos crashed
the block party last year,

so "Spine Chills"
is Pine Hills only.

said we could go here.

We will, we will.

Look, I've got a Groupon here
for a zip line adventure.

12:16.603 --> 12:19.170
Let us in, and it's yours.

Zip-lining is everything to me,
but if I take that,
