00:08.276 --> 00:09.143
Oh, Dan.

00:09.177 --> 00:10.344
Hmm?

00:10.378 --> 00:11.779
Tell Roseanne I borrowed
the double boiler, not

00:11.812 --> 00:13.981
the stew pot; and the ladle,
not the slotted spoon.

00:14.014 --> 00:14.882
OK?

00:14.915 --> 00:15.783
You got that?

00:15.816 --> 00:17.518
You want me to write that down?

00:17.551 --> 00:18.719
Jackie was here--

00:22.256 --> 00:24.658
took stuff.

00:24.692 --> 00:25.993
Got it!

00:26.026 --> 00:30.564
Dan, I'm serious, because
Roseanne might need the ladle.

00:30.598 --> 00:31.299
And I just want her to
know that I have it.

00:31.332 --> 00:33.501
OK?

00:33.534 --> 00:34.402
Jackie has the ladle.

00:37.671 --> 00:39.773
We have a ladle?

00:39.807 --> 00:40.674
Hey, I knew it.

00:40.708 --> 00:41.709
I knew it.

00:41.742 --> 00:43.043
There's still one
credit card company

00:43.077 --> 00:45.246
willing to take a gamble on us.

00:48.149 --> 00:50.684
Well, Melanie McPhee,
Customer Relations,

00:50.718 --> 00:52.086
you're about to lose your job.

00:54.888 --> 00:59.927
And she so looked
forward to working with us.

00:59.960 --> 01:02.330
Hey, hey, hey.

01:02.363 --> 01:05.065
Ray Wilson sent us
two tickets to come

01:05.099 --> 01:06.500
and see him play in Chicago.

01:06.534 --> 01:08.469
Stingray Wilson.
Wow.

01:08.502 --> 01:09.437
Wow.

01:09.470 --> 01:10.904
Man, did you even know
he was back in town?

01:10.938 --> 01:13.241
Yes, I have heard
something to that effect.

01:13.274 --> 01:16.744
Oh, those were good times
when you used to play for him.

01:16.777 --> 01:19.913
Not for him-- with him.

01:19.947 --> 01:23.384
Some people thought
I carried him.

01:23.417 --> 01:26.354
Yeah, right.

01:26.387 --> 01:30.658
Like Ringo carried
John, Paul, and George.

01:30.691 --> 01:31.959
I held my own with him.

01:31.992 --> 01:33.261
Didn't I, Rosie?

01:33.294 --> 01:34.628
Yeah.

01:34.662 --> 01:36.330
Remember that time you guys
played the county fairgrounds?

01:36.364 --> 01:38.999
You rocked that place.

01:39.032 --> 01:40.033
That was after
I left the band.

01:43.371 --> 01:45.406
Oh.

01:45.439 --> 01:47.708
Well, then, who the hell was I
making out with after the show?

01:51.245 --> 01:52.346
You know what, Dan?

01:52.380 --> 01:54.515
I'm starting to remember
now, and you were good.

01:54.548 --> 01:56.684
You were really good--
really, really good.

01:56.717 --> 02:00.588
Don't patronize me, Jackie,
because I really was good.

02:00.621 --> 02:01.822
Rosie, remember
those games we played

02:01.855 --> 02:02.923
at the Sportsman's Lodge?

02:02.956 --> 02:04.892
We packed that joint
five weekends in a row.

02:04.925 --> 02:06.794
Yeah, I remember you
would have had six,

02:06.827 --> 02:09.129
but the owner bumped you
guys for that wrassling bear.

02:12.233 --> 02:13.133
You were in a band?

02:15.703 --> 02:16.570
Yes.

02:16.604 --> 02:17.971
Is that so hard to believe?

02:18.005 --> 02:18.806
Yeah.

02:22.843 --> 02:25.145
I mean, a little, because--

02:25.179 --> 02:25.979
no, sir.

02:30.050 --> 02:32.920
[theme music]

03:20.133 --> 03:22.303
Hey, D.J., what
do you got there?

03:22.336 --> 03:24.037
Mice.

03:24.071 --> 03:25.506
Oh, oh.

03:25.539 --> 03:27.941
Oh, oh, oh hey, guys.

03:27.975 --> 03:30.411
Oh, D.J., they're great.

03:30.444 --> 03:32.780
What are you doing with
these cute little fellows?

03:32.813 --> 03:35.115
Well, I'm breeding them
to sell to the research lab.

03:38.252 --> 03:39.119
What?

03:39.152 --> 03:40.421
Oh, I'm raking it in, too.

03:40.454 --> 03:41.355
I mean, look.

03:41.389 --> 03:44.492
The last batch
got me this watch.

03:44.525 --> 03:47.094
D.J., it's blood
money, and it's wrong.

03:47.127 --> 03:48.729
I think your parents
should know about this.

03:48.762 --> 03:52.132
Hey wait, wait, wait a minute.

03:52.165 --> 03:55.803
And what would it take to
keep you quiet about this?

03:55.836 --> 03:57.204
You're trying to buy me off?

03:57.237 --> 03:58.306
Yeah.

03:58.339 --> 04:00.140
You know, Darlene's
birthday is coming up.

04:00.173 --> 04:04.011
You could probably use,
you know, some extra cash.

04:04.044 --> 04:05.979
I don't need it that bad.

04:06.013 --> 04:07.748
I mean, I'll just get her
something nice and simple

04:07.781 --> 04:09.249
with the money I do have.

04:09.283 --> 04:10.884
Yeah, Darlene's
pretty understanding.

04:10.918 --> 04:12.453
Remember last year
when all you did

04:12.486 --> 04:14.322
was give her a ride
into the country?

04:14.355 --> 04:16.424
And then, exactly how
long did it take you

04:16.457 --> 04:17.758
to walk back from the country?

04:22.330 --> 04:24.798
[sighing] Aww, well you--

04:24.832 --> 04:28.402
you know, mice do eat a
lot of really fatty foods,

04:28.436 --> 04:29.637
like cheese.

04:29.670 --> 04:32.540
So they probably wouldn't
live that long anyway.

04:32.573 --> 04:33.607
Yeah, OK, whatever.

04:36.677 --> 04:38.078
Let's see here.

04:38.111 --> 04:39.547
This ought to about cover it.

04:39.580 --> 04:40.448
Here.

04:40.481 --> 04:42.716
Put a nice pretty bow on it.

04:51.191 --> 04:54.061
[brushing teeth]

04:59.099 --> 05:00.801
I'm trying really
hard not to notice

05:00.834 --> 05:04.271
that you're sending me
some nonverbal message.

05:04.304 --> 05:06.940
That, or you've got rabies.

05:06.974 --> 05:07.841
OK, fine.

05:07.875 --> 05:09.410
You want to get into this?

05:09.443 --> 05:11.178
Jackie made that
comment about Ringo.

05:11.211 --> 05:12.746
It made me feel like
a complete idiot.

05:12.780 --> 05:14.014
You were standing
right there, and you

05:14.047 --> 05:15.749
didn't even come to my defense.

05:15.783 --> 05:18.419
I gave her a dirty look.

05:18.452 --> 05:20.287
You call that defending me?

05:20.320 --> 05:21.989
It wasn't just
any dirty look, Dan.

05:22.022 --> 05:23.991
It was my combination
nostril flare,

05:24.024 --> 05:27.227
lip curl, and half a squint.

05:27.260 --> 05:28.061
Go spit.

05:30.898 --> 05:32.966
If you think I'm
talented, say it.

05:33.000 --> 05:34.368
I think you're talented.

05:34.402 --> 05:37.104
You're just saying that.

05:37.137 --> 05:38.238
Come on, Dan.

05:38.271 --> 05:39.740
Your old singing buddy
comes back into town.

05:39.773 --> 05:41.442
And now you're acting
like your whole life

05:41.475 --> 05:42.576
has been a big mistake.

05:42.610 --> 05:44.311
Not my whole life, Roseanne.

05:44.344 --> 05:45.212
Oh.

05:45.245 --> 05:48.148
Oh, so it's my fault, right?

05:48.181 --> 05:49.683
I had to make a choice.

05:49.717 --> 05:52.285
You made me feel like if I
went on the road with Ray,

05:52.319 --> 05:54.121
you wouldn't be there
when I got back.

05:54.154 --> 05:55.989
This isn't about
joining a band, Dan.

05:56.023 --> 05:57.691
You're just using that
as some excuse to avoid

05:57.725 --> 05:59.092
what's really going on here.

05:59.126 --> 06:00.360
What's really going on here?

06:00.394 --> 06:04.465
Do the words "mid-life
crisis" mean anything to you?

06:04.498 --> 06:07.134
You are making no sense.

06:07.167 --> 06:08.402
Yes, I am, Dan.

06:08.436 --> 06:10.370
You are the very same
age my dad was when

06:10.404 --> 06:12.272
he took up with that mistress.
- Yeah?

06:12.305 --> 06:13.874
Maybe I should check
and see if his mistress

06:13.907 --> 06:17.645
is still available.

06:17.678 --> 06:20.681
Well, I think enough
has been said here.

Goodnight.

06:21.615 --> 06:24.084
Goodnight.

06:24.117 --> 06:27.120
We were both actually
going to sleep in our bed?

06:27.154 --> 06:28.622
Yes, if there's room.

08:33.981 --> 08:35.082
David, you've got to help me.

08:35.115 --> 08:36.650
I mean, a couple of
the mice got loose.

08:36.684 --> 08:39.119
If my mom finds out,
she's going to kill me.

08:39.152 --> 08:41.388
If two mice live and
one little boy is killed,

08:41.421 --> 08:42.656
justice has been served.

08:45.425 --> 08:46.760
Hmm.

08:46.794 --> 08:51.064
Now I wonder what animal rights
activist Darlene would think

08:51.098 --> 08:53.567
when she found out that you
drove me down to that lab

08:53.601 --> 08:56.269
with those mice.

08:56.303 --> 08:58.271
You wouldn't tell her.

08:58.305 --> 09:00.173
Darlene, he just
sat in the car

09:00.207 --> 09:04.177
counting his money while his
furry friends were butchered.

09:10.851 --> 09:11.952
I got to get my own place.

09:14.955 --> 09:17.190
Hey, how many is
a "couple of mice?

09:17.224 --> 09:18.025

09:25.398 --> 09:27.300

the horsey at the same time.

09:41.114 --> 09:43.150
You guys aren't talking
to each other, are you?

09:43.183 --> 09:44.417
Wow.

09:44.451 --> 09:49.589
Your powers of observation
never cease to astound me.

09:49.623 --> 09:53.093
No, actually, Dan thinks
that I ruined his life.

09:53.126 --> 09:56.630
Because of me, he did not get to
pursue his great dream of being

09:56.664 --> 09:58.932
the king of rock and roll.

10:06.273 --> 10:08.776
I did not stop Dan
from being a musician.

10:08.809 --> 10:09.677
I know that.

10:09.710 --> 10:10.744
Believe me.

10:10.778 --> 10:12.713
I could have stopped
him if I wanted to.

10:12.746 --> 10:13.881
But I didn't.

10:13.914 --> 10:15.315
[clinking]

10:16.316 --> 10:17.685
Did I?

10:17.718 --> 10:19.586
Of course you didn't.

10:19.619 --> 10:21.789
Did you?

10:21.822 --> 10:24.257
I mean, did Dan ever once
stop and think that maybe I

10:24.291 --> 10:25.425
gave up some of my dreams too?

10:25.458 --> 10:26.259
(LOUDLY) Yes.

wanted to be a magician.

OK.

10:41.842 --> 10:43.143
Well, uh, I'm
going to get going.

10:43.176 --> 10:44.845
Just give me the tickets,
and I'll get out of here.

10:44.878 --> 10:45.813
What tickets?

10:45.846 --> 10:47.748
The tickets to
see Ray Wilson play.

10:47.781 --> 10:49.216
You gave her our tickets?

10:49.249 --> 10:52.853
Hey, you guys
are talking again.

10:52.886 --> 10:53.787
No.

10:53.821 --> 10:56.724
I didn't just give
her the tickets.

10:56.757 --> 11:00.560
She had to promise to help
me throw all your crap out.

11:00.593 --> 11:02.730
Well, I still want
to go, and I'm going.

11:02.763 --> 11:06.433
Oh, you are going, all right.

11:06.466 --> 11:11.371
So, then, looks like it's
just you and me, big guy.

11:11.404 --> 11:14.074
Or, uh, well, actually, why
don't you just go on your own?

11:14.107 --> 11:15.709
And, uh, you have
a good time, pal.

11:21.281 --> 11:22.082
Ugh.

11:27.554 --> 11:31.458
You probably should cut
down on your salt, Dan.

11:31.491 --> 11:32.492
That's what killed Elvis.

11:39.767 --> 11:40.901
OK, guys.

11:40.934 --> 11:42.235
What are we looking for?

11:42.269 --> 11:46.006

tell anybody-- mice.

you right, D.J.

What you were doing was wrong,
and you were forced to stop.

Now, while I mourn
for those little mice.

12:20.440 --> 12:22.843
Those cats may have
done you a big favor.

No, you shouldn't, Jackie.

You would just depress people.

I'm not kidding.

You know when you asked me out,
and I told you I had a cold?

really been hurting,

wrote that whole song
