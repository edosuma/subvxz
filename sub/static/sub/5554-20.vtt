have language on the back
called, um, "boilerplate."

01:27.855 --> 01:29.555
I know what boilerplate is.

Why does it seem like you've
just recently learned the term?

01:31.859 --> 01:33.142
Well, it's been a while

01:33.143 --> 01:34.426

some of my old law books.

01:34.428 --> 01:36.128
They are full of information.

01:36.130 --> 01:38.397
Anyway, the point is,

01:38.399 --> 01:41.166
they have the right to refuse
you from being on the show.

01:41.168 --> 01:43.602
Like casinos can keep out card
counters for being too good.

01:43.604 --> 01:46.472
Mom, we dared
Toby to dance.

Great. Well, maybe you

02:06.160 --> 02:08.460
Uh, sort of. Picked on.

02:08.462 --> 02:10.195
Treated different.
Shut out.

02:10.197 --> 02:12.131
But not "discriminated against."

02:12.133 --> 02:14.433
Ahem. Who here has
the law degree?

02:14.435 --> 02:16.301
I hope that was rhetorical.

02:16.303 --> 02:19.738
Uh, actually,
I have it right here.

02:19.740 --> 02:22.174
Ah, Americans with
Disabilities Act

02:22.176 --> 02:24.143
prevents you from being
discriminated against

02:24.145 --> 02:25.844
because you're
physically different.

02:25.846 --> 02:28.380
Is that the spirit
of that statute?

02:28.382 --> 02:31.216
Hep! Who here
has a law degree?

02:31.218 --> 02:33.752
He is being denied
simply because

02:33.754 --> 02:35.854
his brain is different
than most people.

02:35.856 --> 02:38.157
Same reason why I couldn't get
a license to operate a crane.

02:38.159 --> 02:39.591
What now?
Anyway...

We know his type--

You have to stop hacking

division of Homeland.

04:00.708 --> 04:04.009

military base

05:06.373 --> 05:07.839

05:07.841 --> 05:10.442
located in Djibouti.
Strategically located

05:10.444 --> 05:13.312

a newly developed audio

05:21.455 --> 05:23.388
surveillance system.
With the base's

05:23.390 --> 05:25.757
proximity to lawless regions
on the continent

05:25.759 --> 05:27.326
and the Arabian
peninsula...

05:27.328 --> 05:29.428
The base could pick up
on terrorist chatter.

05:29.430 --> 05:31.663
Yes. From
incredible distances.

05:31.665 --> 05:33.565
Now, the tech's so powerful
it can hear conversations

05:33.567 --> 05:35.567
from hundreds of miles away,
then dig out

05:35.569 --> 05:38.103
that specific frequency
amidst all the audio clutter

05:38.105 --> 05:40.339
so that we can hear it
clear as day.

05:40.341 --> 05:42.107
That's impressive
but a basic setup.

05:42.109 --> 05:45.777
Any decent audio engineer
could do this. So why us?

05:45.779 --> 05:47.112
The Feds want it
properly installed,

05:47.114 --> 05:48.947
and they want it
installed yesterday.

05:48.949 --> 05:50.949

06:07.935 --> 06:09.868

No. It's a...

06:09.870 --> 06:12.404
valid question.

06:12.406 --> 06:13.672
I was a SEAL.

06:13.674 --> 06:15.674
I did some top
secret missions.

06:15.676 --> 06:17.409
Last year, I caught
some shrapnel,

06:17.411 --> 06:20.579
some of which is still lodged
in my lower back.

06:20.581 --> 06:22.881
So the Navy medically
discharged me,

06:22.883 --> 06:24.883
and I'm appealing
their decision.

06:24.885 --> 06:27.152
If I don't win,

06:27.154 --> 06:29.855
then I figured
that Homeland would be

06:29.857 --> 06:32.157
another option for me
to serve my country.

06:32.159 --> 06:34.159
Now, I requested Scorpion detail

You know
that Paige respects you.

07:16.369 --> 07:18.202

then Paige will think it's okay

07:18.205 --> 07:21.540
to respect Tim
and might start to like Tim.

09:00.874 --> 09:02.207
I've got the
receptors working.

09:02.209 --> 09:04.209
Let's take this baby
for a spin.

09:04.211 --> 09:06.578
Whoa. You can't just eavesdrop
on other nations

09:06.580 --> 09:08.113
without prior authorization.

09:08.115 --> 09:10.815
Paige and Toby are on the roof
securing the antenna. Try them.

09:12.586 --> 09:13.952
SYLVESTER:
Got our building.

09:13.954 --> 09:14.819
Turn it on.

09:14.821 --> 09:16.438
TIM: Um... (chuckles)

09:16.439 --> 09:18.056
are we sure we want
to eavesdrop on teammates?

09:18.058 --> 09:20.959
It's not eavesdropping.
It's testing our work.

09:20.961 --> 09:22.627
And, actually, listening
in on the thoughts

09:22.629 --> 09:25.630
of a genius
is an educational experience.

09:25.632 --> 09:27.799
TOBY: "Djibouti" is fun to say.
Sounds like "ja booty."

09:27.801 --> 09:30.802
Hey, Paige,
you wearing sunscreen?

09:30.804 --> 09:33.071
Don't want to get burned
in Djibouti.

09:33.073 --> 09:35.674
It's illuminating.

09:36.643 --> 09:39.978
Tim and I have some
business with Major Janeway.

09:39.980 --> 09:42.814
So, uh, you guys dot the
I's and cross the T's.

09:42.816 --> 09:44.082
We'll be back in
an hour or so.

09:44.084 --> 09:45.283
WALTER:
Okay.

09:49.289 --> 09:50.622
Sly.

09:50.624 --> 09:52.591
Happy.

09:53.093 --> 09:55.894
Did you see how he opened
the door for Cabe?

09:55.896 --> 09:59.030
He lifted the handle
and he turned it.

09:59.032 --> 10:00.699
How else would he know
that there was something wrong

10:00.701 --> 10:03.301
with the knob if he hadn't been
on the base before, huh?

10:03.303 --> 10:05.670
I don't know, Nancy Drew.
But who cares?

10:05.672 --> 10:08.073
We're here to set up a pop stand
and get paid.

10:08.075 --> 10:09.641
A pop stand
that is incredibly easy

10:09.643 --> 10:11.076
to assemble.
There is no logical reason

10:11.078 --> 10:14.112
why we were brought here.
So something's wrong.

10:14.114 --> 10:18.183
But now that we're here,
we have access

10:18.185 --> 10:20.185
to the base's intranet, so...
You know, I don't think

10:20.187 --> 10:22.220
the base
would appreciate us snooping.

10:22.221 --> 10:24.254
We were brought out here to set
up a high-tech listening device.

10:24.257 --> 10:25.757
Snooping is exactly

10:25.759 --> 10:27.959
what we've been paid to do.
You know what,

10:27.961 --> 10:30.629
it was awfully weird that Cabe
wouldn't let me open that box.

10:31.398 --> 10:35.000
Maybe... you
should open the box.

10:36.236 --> 10:39.104
Look, even if we're careful,
things could still go sideways.

10:39.106 --> 10:40.238
Are you ready for this?

10:40.240 --> 10:43.241
We don't have an option
to not be ready.

10:44.177 --> 10:46.244
(starts engine)

10:47.748 --> 10:49.981
(whirring)

10:49.983 --> 10:52.317
(chuckles)

10:52.318 --> 10:54.652
This is an incredibly
advanced 3-D printer.

10:54.655 --> 10:57.088
High-end, non-commercial
government prototype.

10:57.090 --> 10:58.990
Antenna's securely
fastened.

10:58.992 --> 11:00.125
What's going on here?

11:00.127 --> 11:02.060
We think Tim might be hinky.

11:02.062 --> 11:05.030
Walt's looking him up
on the base's system.

11:05.032 --> 11:07.032
Why would there by data
on Tim in Djibouti?

11:07.034 --> 11:08.299
"Ja booty."

11:08.301 --> 11:10.035
Never gets old.

11:10.037 --> 11:11.903
Because we're being deceived.

11:11.905 --> 11:14.105
Tim is not who
he's pretending to be.

11:21.882 --> 11:23.682
We walk from here.

11:23.684 --> 11:25.717
Stay behind me, stay quiet.
Sound'll get us killed.

11:27.988 --> 11:30.055
♪ ♪

11:43.370 --> 11:45.370
Copley's the
one in white.

11:45.372 --> 11:47.038
The rest are
bodyguards.

11:51.845 --> 11:53.978
Now's our chance.

11:53.980 --> 11:55.146
Let's go.

11:55.148 --> 11:57.215
♪ ♪

12:20.907 --> 12:23.742
♪ ♪

12:48.135 --> 12:50.268
Okay, our intel says
it's a 12-by-12 box

12:50.270 --> 12:51.970
with a large knot
on the side.

12:51.972 --> 12:53.271
Okay.

12:54.407 --> 12:56.474
Hey, is this it?

13:01.448 --> 13:03.515
Yeah.

13:06.887 --> 13:08.319
This is what Jennings died for.

13:09.923 --> 13:12.891
(indistinct voices approaching)

13:12.893 --> 13:14.492
All right.

13:14.494 --> 13:17.162
They're back in the warehouse.
Hurry up and scan this.

13:17.164 --> 13:20.064
It's 10:45. We got to get
this scan back to the base

13:20.066 --> 13:22.167
and get my team up to
speed and working on it.

13:22.169 --> 13:26.004
And get back here before
this bowl goes anywhere.

13:26.006 --> 13:27.505
Done.

13:37.350 --> 13:39.450
You go ahead,
I'll catch up.

13:49.996 --> 13:51.296
You-- stop!

13:55.602 --> 13:57.302
Get the truck!

13:57.304 --> 13:58.403
We got friends!

13:58.405 --> 14:00.071
I'll cover you.
Start the jeep.

14:06.479 --> 14:08.379
(engine starts)

14:08.381 --> 14:10.448
(gunshots)

14:16.056 --> 14:17.989
We got enough of a lead
to make it back

14:17.991 --> 14:19.357
over the border to the base.

14:19.359 --> 14:20.458
Yeah, well,
that's gonna be tough to do

14:20.460 --> 14:22.160
when you're running out of fuel.

14:22.162 --> 14:23.494
Look.

14:23.496 --> 14:25.396
Aw, they must've
hit the fuel tank.

14:25.398 --> 14:27.398
All right, new plan.

14:27.400 --> 14:29.300
You take the scanner
and you head back to the base

14:29.302 --> 14:31.402
and finish the mission.
No, Cabe.

14:31.404 --> 14:34.505
I already lost one man over this
detail, I'm not losing another.

14:34.507 --> 14:35.573
Well, it's not your call.

14:45.018 --> 14:46.384
Here goes nothing.

15:01.368 --> 15:03.434
I work for a buyer.

15:03.436 --> 15:05.270
I was just trying to
confirm whether or not

15:05.272 --> 15:06.638
you really had artifacts.

15:06.640 --> 15:09.073
Well, tell that to my boss
when you wake up.

15:09.075 --> 15:10.241
(grunts)

15:19.286 --> 15:20.919
This is not about suspicion,
this is about having

15:20.921 --> 15:22.153
all the facts.
Facts that you hope will prove

15:22.155 --> 15:24.923
your preconceived
opinion that Tim

15:24.925 --> 15:26.557
isn't telling
the full truth.

15:26.559 --> 15:28.559
In other words:
suspicion.

15:28.561 --> 15:31.045
Timothy Armstrong.

15:31.046 --> 15:33.530
Spotless service record, master
chief petty officer, citations

15:33.533 --> 15:35.199
for meritorious service.

15:35.201 --> 15:37.302
That's mildly impressive.

15:37.304 --> 15:38.536
It's impressive.

15:38.538 --> 15:41.706
Yeah, well this is
straightforward

15:41.708 --> 15:45.043
except for...
Ooh, a PDF classified SCI.

15:45.045 --> 15:47.378
Sensitive Compartmental
Information?

15:47.380 --> 15:49.480
That's like Top Secret
Plus. You click on that,

15:49.482 --> 15:50.949
you're committing some
serious crimeage.

15:55.188 --> 15:56.721
Okay,

15:56.723 --> 16:00.024
on 8/12/2015,

16:00.026 --> 16:02.260
Master Chief Petty
Officer Armstrong

16:02.262 --> 16:04.662
and Petty Officer
Third Class Jennings

16:04.664 --> 16:07.432
were victims of an IED attack

16:07.434 --> 16:09.334
just over the Djibouti border.

16:09.336 --> 16:11.169
Armstrong survived
despite

16:11.171 --> 16:13.705
extensive injuries.
Jennings' wounds were fatal.

16:13.707 --> 16:15.173
That's what got me my discharge.

16:15.175 --> 16:17.675
Uh, we were just...

16:17.677 --> 16:19.744
snooping into your record.

16:19.746 --> 16:23.147
That report is from our first
attempt to infiltrate

16:23.149 --> 16:24.682
the operations of Shane Copley,

16:24.684 --> 16:27.685
South African trafficker
in stolen antiquities.

16:27.687 --> 16:29.320
He's the man
who has Cabe right now.

16:29.322 --> 16:31.723
And hopefully...
What do you mean, has Cabe?

16:31.725 --> 16:33.458
When we got hit with the IED,
that was our first attempt

16:33.460 --> 16:35.727
to recover
important antiquities. Today

16:35.729 --> 16:37.028
was our second.

16:37.030 --> 16:39.697
It went south.
Where is Cabe?

16:39.699 --> 16:41.299
Across the border in Mukaria.
Look, this'll all go

16:41.301 --> 16:43.468
a lot easier if you just let me
explain what's going on.

16:43.470 --> 16:44.635
Okay, then hurry.

16:44.637 --> 16:46.004
For years, terrorists have been

16:46.006 --> 16:47.822
raiding Middle Eastern museums,

16:47.823 --> 16:49.639
taking priceless antiquities
to sell on the black market.

16:49.642 --> 16:51.676
Now, the cash from these sales

16:51.678 --> 16:54.712
fund training, fake visas,
advanced explosives.

16:54.714 --> 16:58.249
So a 3,000-year-old pot becomes
a bomb in a concert hall.

16:58.251 --> 17:00.551
And Copley brokers these deals
for millions in cash.

17:00.553 --> 17:02.153
So, he's their funding?

17:02.155 --> 17:03.588
He's indirectly responsible

17:03.590 --> 17:05.490
for the deaths
of thousands of people.

17:05.492 --> 17:06.724
Conservatively.

17:06.726 --> 17:08.126
Is Copley a killer?

17:08.127 --> 17:09.527
He'd do anything
to protect his business,

17:09.529 --> 17:11.396
but he's not stupid.

17:11.398 --> 17:12.730
He wouldn't kill Cabe without
interrogating him first

17:12.732 --> 17:15.133
to find out why he was
around his warehouse.

17:15.135 --> 17:16.768
Great, so now
he's just being tortured.

17:16.770 --> 17:19.170
Yeah, thanks to Tim,
who left him behind.

17:19.172 --> 17:20.738
No, he kicked me
out of a jeep.

17:20.740 --> 17:22.574
I can see Cabe doing that.

17:22.575 --> 17:24.409
We're on a military base.
Call for backup.

17:24.411 --> 17:26.644
No. Copley's smart enough to...
stay across the border

17:26.646 --> 17:28.346
in Makuria.
That's an enemy government.

17:28.348 --> 17:30.581
We send in troops, that's
an international incident.

17:30.583 --> 17:32.316
Cabe and I knew that
when we went out this morning.

17:32.318 --> 17:33.785
We knew that we were
we going out alone

17:33.787 --> 17:35.570
and that there was no help.

17:35.571 --> 17:37.354
You rooked him
into a suicide mission.

17:37.357 --> 17:38.589
The government
assigned a mission,

17:38.591 --> 17:40.792
and Cabe said nothing but "yes."

17:42.695 --> 17:45.096
Why keep it secret from us?
Because...

17:45.098 --> 17:46.764
he knew we might take fire.

17:46.766 --> 17:48.466
Okay?
Our orders are shoot to kill.

17:48.468 --> 17:50.334
He knows that's not your thing.
He was trying to protect you.

17:50.336 --> 17:52.503
I don't like being lied to.

17:52.505 --> 17:53.671
HAPPY: Uh, no one does,
but the more you chatter,

17:53.673 --> 17:55.373
the less likely
we find Cabe.

17:55.375 --> 17:57.508
Now quiet, I am recording
the outgoing message

17:57.510 --> 17:58.843
on his voice mail.

17:58.845 --> 18:00.578
So you can plug
his vocal signature

18:00.580 --> 18:02.613
into the eavesdropping
software.

18:02.615 --> 18:04.248
Yes, now quiet.

18:04.250 --> 18:05.783
CABE:
Hello, you've reached Cabe.

18:05.785 --> 18:07.752
Please leave me a message.

18:07.754 --> 18:09.253
How the hell you
turn this thing off?

18:09.255 --> 18:11.222
(beep)
Hey, after we save Cabe,

18:11.224 --> 18:12.757
remind me to make
fun of him for that.

18:12.759 --> 18:15.259
Okay, now I download
his voice sample.

18:15.261 --> 18:17.095
And I'll position
the parabolic antennae

18:17.097 --> 18:19.464
towards Copley
and his stash house.

18:19.466 --> 18:22.200
Approximately
15.77 degrees north,

18:22.202 --> 18:24.268
39.7643
degrees east.

18:24.270 --> 18:28.139
Okay, and once I cancel out
all the other frequencies,

18:28.141 --> 18:29.874
it should leave
just Cabe's voice.

18:29.876 --> 18:31.409
If he's alive.

18:31.411 --> 18:33.411
When Jennings got killed
I carried his body

18:33.413 --> 18:36.447
four miles on my back
trading fire with hostiles.

18:36.449 --> 18:38.749
I don't just
leave people behind.

18:38.751 --> 18:41.786
Uh, Cabe's alive. I hear him.

18:41.788 --> 18:44.122
CABE: If I wanted to steal it,

18:44.124 --> 18:46.624
I would have and you would have
found it on me.

18:46.626 --> 18:48.126
It ain't simple logic?

18:48.128 --> 18:49.494
(thump)
(Cabe grunts)

18:49.496 --> 18:51.295
Oh, God, they're beating him.

18:51.297 --> 18:53.498
(thump)
Aah!

18:53.500 --> 18:54.899
(grunting)

18:56.870 --> 18:58.569
Oh, God.

18:58.571 --> 19:00.571
(panting)

19:00.573 --> 19:02.607
That stung a little, eh?

19:02.609 --> 19:04.775
He's just getting
warmed up.

19:04.777 --> 19:07.478
So, one more time.

19:07.480 --> 19:08.846
Who do you work for?

19:08.848 --> 19:11.449
American
military?

19:11.451 --> 19:14.185
And where's your friend
who was shooting at us?

19:14.187 --> 19:18.156
I'm doing recon for a client.

19:18.825 --> 19:20.525
They want to buy an item.

19:20.527 --> 19:22.260
They'll beat any price.

19:22.262 --> 19:24.795
And you heard about
this item where?

19:24.797 --> 19:26.597
Antiquities market is small.

19:26.599 --> 19:28.232
People talk.

19:28.234 --> 19:30.301
And so will you.

19:32.739 --> 19:34.872
I'm gonna wait
for the Sampsons.

19:34.874 --> 19:36.374
Work him over

19:36.376 --> 19:37.942
until he tells you
whether he was trying

19:37.944 --> 19:40.411
to steal the bowl for himself
or someone else.

19:40.413 --> 19:41.679
(thump)
(Cabe grunts)

19:41.681 --> 19:43.514
Bowl-- what bowl?

19:43.516 --> 19:44.682
This one.

19:44.684 --> 19:46.350
A 4,000-year-old
ceremonial vessel

19:46.352 --> 19:48.252
used in fertility rites.

19:48.254 --> 19:49.820
Black market value:

19:49.822 --> 19:51.222
$5 million.

19:51.224 --> 19:53.391
Who's out there buying
a $5 million bowl?

19:53.393 --> 19:54.792
Someone with
a ton of bread.

19:54.794 --> 19:57.295
Any billionaire can buy
a McLaren, but that is special.

19:57.297 --> 19:58.829
And if you have
the morals of a hyena,

19:58.831 --> 20:00.865
owning it'll make you
feel special.

20:00.867 --> 20:02.867
So what exactly
was our mission here?

20:02.869 --> 20:04.602
Well, if Copley
was just killed or captured,

20:04.604 --> 20:06.921
another person
would just take his place.

20:06.922 --> 20:09.239
But if we can surgically inject
a forgery into the market,

20:09.242 --> 20:10.875
then it could collapse
his entire organization.

20:10.877 --> 20:12.843
So once the buyers
realize it's a phony,

20:12.845 --> 20:15.446
Copley'll be discredited,
his operation'll be shut down

20:15.448 --> 20:17.315
and nobody'll know
if he's selling knockoffs

20:17.317 --> 20:18.950
or the actual McCoy.

20:18.952 --> 20:20.751
Preying on the innate
human behavioral traits

20:20.753 --> 20:22.720
of cynicism and distrust.
I like it.

20:22.722 --> 20:24.855
Our plan was to sneak in,
scan the original,

20:24.857 --> 20:26.757
copy it and replace it
with a fake.

20:26.759 --> 20:28.993
How do you copy
a 4,000 year-old bowl?

20:28.995 --> 20:30.861
I think it might have something
to do with this incredible

20:30.863 --> 20:33.231
3-D printer that we
weren't supposed to open.

20:33.233 --> 20:35.733
Yes, incredible
but not flawless.

20:35.735 --> 20:36.867
It can fabricate
vulcanized rubber

20:36.869 --> 20:38.569
and industrial plastics
in minutes,

20:38.571 --> 20:40.438
but DARPA hasn't been able
to figure out

20:40.440 --> 20:42.573
how to make it work
with organic materials.

20:42.575 --> 20:44.542
And that is where
Scorpion comes in.

20:44.544 --> 20:45.977
Well, is the bowl
even our focus anymore

20:45.979 --> 20:47.578
or do we just
get Cabe and get out?

20:47.580 --> 20:49.380
A SEAL lost his
life for this.

20:49.382 --> 20:50.815
Knowing Cabe,
he's not going home

20:50.817 --> 20:51.949
until our mission's complete.

20:51.951 --> 20:53.985
We're now officially
two-pronged.

20:53.987 --> 20:55.353
Luckily, both our prongs,

20:55.355 --> 20:56.854
Cabe and the bowl,
are in the same compound.

20:56.856 --> 20:59.023
On the counterfeit bowl prong:
whether we copy it or not

20:59.025 --> 21:01.859
depends on the kind of organic
material we're talking about.

21:01.861 --> 21:05.630
This. The type of clay-laden
soil used to make the bowl.

21:05.632 --> 21:07.765
It's only found
here in this area of Africa.

21:07.767 --> 21:09.934
Okay, so, we need
to reconfigure the software

21:09.936 --> 21:12.436
in the printer. Sylvester?
On it.

21:12.438 --> 21:13.704
I'll adjust the output jets
so that they're

21:13.706 --> 21:14.905
compatible with the clay.

21:14.907 --> 21:17.408
Now, our intel has the buyers--

21:17.410 --> 21:19.644
a couple from New York,
the Sampsons--

21:19.645 --> 21:21.879
arriving in less than two hours,
so we need to get all this done

21:21.881 --> 21:24.515
before the real bowl is sold to them.
Well, my team

21:24.517 --> 21:25.816
can handle the fake bowl,
can you

21:25.818 --> 21:26.884
take care of the buyer issue?

21:26.886 --> 21:28.519
Well, luckily, Copley's men

21:28.521 --> 21:30.021
didn't get a clear look at me.

21:30.023 --> 21:31.622
So... I have an idea.

21:31.624 --> 21:33.858
But I'll need to reach out
to the Djibouti ambassador

21:33.860 --> 21:36.060
and get the name of his tailor.

21:37.297 --> 21:39.930
♪ ♪

21:56.983 --> 21:57.915
How's it coming?

21:57.917 --> 21:59.934
Almost there.

21:59.935 --> 22:01.952
Now we just need to bake it
to oxidize the cobalt

22:01.954 --> 22:03.587
in it, which would change

22:03.589 --> 22:07.024
its color
and make it appear aged.

22:08.628 --> 22:10.361
(shouts)

22:16.469 --> 22:17.968
(grunts)

22:17.970 --> 22:19.070
Still nothing to say?

22:19.072 --> 22:20.604
Yeah.

22:20.606 --> 22:22.606
Your breath stinks.

22:22.608 --> 22:25.076
Eat a mint.

22:25.078 --> 22:27.411
(chuckles softly)

22:27.413 --> 22:30.614
You've got a smart mouth on you.

22:30.616 --> 22:34.018
Now it's time
to shut it up.

22:34.020 --> 22:35.853
Sir, the buyers
are early.

22:37.056 --> 22:39.523
Spread some plastic under him.

22:39.992 --> 22:41.692
I'll be back.

22:54.574 --> 22:56.040
Welcome to my shop,
Mr. and Mrs. Sampson.

22:56.042 --> 22:58.709
You're eager. I like that.

22:58.711 --> 23:00.444
Pleasure
to be finally meeting you.

23:00.446 --> 23:02.046
It's hot in the desert,
isn't it, sweetheart?

23:02.048 --> 23:03.981
Scorching.

23:03.983 --> 23:05.983
I'm so pleased
to have you as my guests.

23:05.985 --> 23:08.652
Funny way you have
of showing it.

23:08.654 --> 23:10.654
When dealing
with a $5 million purchase,

23:10.656 --> 23:12.423
care must be taken.

23:13.659 --> 23:16.494
(chuckles) No payment
until we have the bowl.

23:17.563 --> 23:19.497
When dealing
with a $5 million purchase,

23:19.499 --> 23:21.766
care must be taken.

23:21.768 --> 23:23.768
Fair enough.

23:23.770 --> 23:25.069
Let's go inside

23:25.071 --> 23:26.670
and do business.

23:33.713 --> 23:35.413
All right, they're inside.
Okay.

23:36.482 --> 23:38.482
(grunts)

23:38.484 --> 23:41.652
Yeah.
(grunts)

23:41.654 --> 23:44.488
(grunts)

23:44.490 --> 23:46.424
Shh, shh.

23:46.426 --> 23:49.493
Okay. Now, we need to get
to that shed.

23:49.495 --> 23:51.495
Slight problem. The stun gun
that Tim gave us back

23:51.497 --> 23:53.731
at the base must've been hit by a
stray rock on the drive.  Shoot.

23:53.733 --> 23:54.965
It's broken.
We need that.

23:54.967 --> 23:56.534
No, we don't.
We just need to replicate

23:56.536 --> 23:57.868
what the stun gun
was supposed to do for us.

23:57.870 --> 23:59.703
With what I have
in my medical bag and the thorns

23:59.705 --> 24:01.739
and berries in that bush
over there, we can do it.

24:01.741 --> 24:03.007
Come on.

24:05.111 --> 24:09.747
(whispering):
Happy. Happy. Happy.

24:23.563 --> 24:24.895
Okay, Paige,

24:24.897 --> 24:26.897
we're in.

24:26.899 --> 24:28.732
This coffee is delicious.

24:28.734 --> 24:31.669
Africa's finest.

24:31.671 --> 24:34.839
We've heard a great deal
about your acquisitions.

24:34.841 --> 24:36.974
If this purchase goes well, you
can expect to see more of us.

24:36.976 --> 24:39.009
And our money.

24:39.011 --> 24:42.179
Speaking of which, there
has been a price adjustment.

24:42.181 --> 24:44.849
The bowl you want
is in great demand.

24:44.851 --> 24:47.251
Just today there was
an attempt to steal it.

24:47.253 --> 24:50.488
And several months ago, U.S.
military tried to track it down.

24:50.490 --> 24:52.756
You don't say.

24:52.758 --> 24:55.759
Yeah. But an IED
killed one,

24:55.761 --> 24:58.095
sent the other one away
like a hurt dog.

24:58.097 --> 24:59.563
(chuckles)

25:02.935 --> 25:06.937
The price is as quoted,
or we walk

25:06.939 --> 25:08.138
and we take our cash with us.

25:08.140 --> 25:09.974
And, please, enough
talk of violence.

25:09.976 --> 25:12.910
We came here for art.

25:12.912 --> 25:14.945
Let's go see it then.

25:14.947 --> 25:16.647
This way.

25:19.151 --> 25:22.219
Paige, we're not ready. You got
to slow him down for 30 seconds.

25:24.891 --> 25:26.657
Put the fake one in.

25:28.628 --> 25:29.293
(screeches)

25:29.295 --> 25:29.994
(shouts)

25:33.099 --> 25:35.032
Uh, not good.

25:35.034 --> 25:36.901
I don't think anybody heard.
Don't worry.

25:36.903 --> 25:38.102
The guards won't kill you

25:38.104 --> 25:40.454
because
I'm gonna kill you first.

25:40.455 --> 25:42.805
Okay, Paige, uh, you got
to stretch those 30 seconds.

25:42.808 --> 25:44.608
Sly just broke
the bowl.

25:44.610 --> 25:46.110
We've got to do some surgery.

25:46.112 --> 25:48.579
They broke the
bowl? Oh, God.

25:48.581 --> 25:49.246
Oh, God.

25:51.684 --> 25:53.817
It's just...

25:53.819 --> 25:56.954
this piece is... beautiful.

25:56.956 --> 25:59.890
Can you, um, tell me a bit
about it?

26:00.860 --> 26:03.160
Of course.

26:03.162 --> 26:05.596
Okay. I'll get the clay
from under the warehouse.

26:05.598 --> 26:08.899
You grab that, uh, old helmet
and pull the wires

26:08.901 --> 26:09.867
from the lights.

26:10.970 --> 26:12.336
Okay.

26:12.338 --> 26:14.271
All right.

26:15.875 --> 26:19.009
And also, on the inside
of this particular pot,

26:19.011 --> 26:22.813
researchers found remnants
of 8,000-year-old olive oil.

26:22.815 --> 26:27.051
Remarkable. Maybe we can
purchase it on our next visit.

26:27.053 --> 26:28.986
I believe that when you find
something rare and beautiful,

26:28.988 --> 26:30.854
you should hold onto it.

26:30.856 --> 26:33.157
Clearly.

26:33.159 --> 26:35.159
So, tell me,

26:35.161 --> 26:37.861
where did you find
this beautiful woman?

26:37.863 --> 26:39.930
(chuckles) We... (chuckles)

26:39.932 --> 26:41.632
met in Paris.
Mm-hmm.

26:41.634 --> 26:44.602
At a cafe.
She was drinking a latte

26:44.604 --> 26:47.204
and she smiled at me,
unaware that the foam

26:47.206 --> 26:49.740
remained right
over her lip.

26:49.742 --> 26:51.675
Well, this is
getting interesting.

26:51.677 --> 26:53.677
Quiet.
She was

26:53.679 --> 26:55.145
absolutely
captivating.

26:55.147 --> 26:57.781
There's nothing
more stunning than

26:57.783 --> 27:00.818
seeing perfection
with a slight imperfection.

27:00.820 --> 27:04.388
It makes the perfection
stand out even more.

27:09.795 --> 27:12.796
Okay, pieces are together.
I've been frying

27:12.798 --> 27:14.732
this metal helmet.
It should be hot

27:14.734 --> 27:16.367
as heck under it.
Be careful.

27:16.369 --> 27:19.203
Let's hope so. The electrical
current will heat the helmet.

27:19.205 --> 27:20.404
The helmet will heat
the clay.

27:20.406 --> 27:22.673
Heated clay will give off
water vapor,

27:22.675 --> 27:24.808
which turns it
from brown to blue.

27:24.810 --> 27:26.744
And looks exactly like
the rest of the bowl.

27:26.746 --> 27:28.412
In theory.

27:29.315 --> 27:31.382
(insect buzzing)

27:35.955 --> 27:38.756
Shh...

27:38.758 --> 27:40.658
You sure this'll work?
The thorns

27:40.660 --> 27:42.793
are slathered in anesthetic. The
berries are gonna weigh 'em down

27:42.795 --> 27:44.728
so they travel faster.
And the rolled up spec

27:44.730 --> 27:46.764
is gonna work
like a perfect blowgun.

27:46.766 --> 27:49.800
So, no, I have no idea
if this is gonna work.

27:49.802 --> 27:51.735
(blows)

27:51.737 --> 27:55.105
(insect buzzing)

27:55.107 --> 27:56.807
He thinks it's a mosquito.

27:56.809 --> 27:57.708
Hit him again. Look, look, look,

27:57.710 --> 27:59.009
he's groggy.

27:59.945 --> 28:01.945
(blows)

28:04.316 --> 28:07.785
Okay, Mongo's coming this way.
What do we do?

28:07.787 --> 28:09.820
Plan B: try to run past him
and get to Cabe.

28:11.791 --> 28:14.058
(panting)

28:14.060 --> 28:16.427
(grunting)

28:16.429 --> 28:17.795
No! No, no, no, no.

28:17.797 --> 28:19.463
Oh, no, you don't!
Don't! His gun!

28:21.300 --> 28:23.334
It's perfect.

28:23.335 --> 28:25.369
Just needs to be sanded down
on the bottom.

28:25.370 --> 28:27.404
I'll do that. Okay, take the
real bowl and get out of here.

28:27.406 --> 28:29.239
What if they show up
before you've left?

28:29.241 --> 28:31.375
Just protect the real bowl. Go.

28:32.278 --> 28:34.078
(grunting)

28:34.080 --> 28:36.313
(shouting)

28:36.315 --> 28:39.083
(grunting)
Hit him with another dart!

28:39.085 --> 28:41.351
They're back by the crates.
(shouts)

28:44.824 --> 28:46.457
(gun clicks)

28:48.194 --> 28:49.393
Thank goodness.

28:49.395 --> 28:51.395
The cavalry's here.

28:57.503 --> 28:58.235
(grunts)

29:07.980 --> 29:09.980
(chirps)

29:09.982 --> 29:12.483
(whimpering)

29:12.485 --> 29:13.517
(Sylvester
screams)

29:13.519 --> 29:15.953
(grunting)

29:18.524 --> 29:20.758
Well done.

29:22.495 --> 29:26.330
(panting)
Untie me.

29:26.332 --> 29:29.233
I'd be happy to show you the
rest of the collection later.

29:29.235 --> 29:32.770
But for now, why don't we go see
the bowl you came here for.

29:32.772 --> 29:35.239
Yes. Good idea.

29:35.241 --> 29:36.540
Uh, it's a bad idea.
I'm not ready.

29:36.542 --> 29:37.274
Wait.

29:37.276 --> 29:38.242
W-Wait.

29:40.479 --> 29:42.012
Is, um...

29:42.014 --> 29:44.848
is this piece seventh
century stoneware?

29:53.926 --> 29:56.460
I have to say,
I'm confused by your desire

29:56.462 --> 29:58.262
to focus on the salad

29:58.264 --> 30:01.365
when the steak is waiting
for you right inside this room.

30:01.367 --> 30:04.101
Please forgive
my wife. She...

30:04.103 --> 30:06.036
just loves to window-shop.

30:06.038 --> 30:07.404
(chuckles)
Well, I love

30:07.406 --> 30:08.539
to complete business,

30:08.541 --> 30:10.574
so let's do so.

30:41.540 --> 30:45.843
It's of museum quality.

30:45.845 --> 30:47.511
Because
a year ago,

30:47.513 --> 30:50.047
it was still in a museum.

30:51.550 --> 30:53.584
Paige, we're almost finished
getting Cabe free.

30:53.586 --> 30:55.603
Now, you guys have
to talk your way

30:55.604 --> 30:57.621
out of there before
he looks in your bag.

30:59.558 --> 31:02.926
There are monkeys everywhere!

31:04.496 --> 31:06.230
4,000 years old.

31:06.232 --> 31:08.031
Created by ancient hands.

31:08.033 --> 31:10.033
You won't find
another one like it.

31:10.035 --> 31:12.202
Whoever made
this is a genius.

31:16.575 --> 31:18.942
But it's chipped. Here.

31:18.944 --> 31:22.412
There seems to be a loss
of mass in transit,

31:22.414 --> 31:25.215
and this glaze is
more vulnerable than expected.

31:25.217 --> 31:27.417
It's 4,000 years old.

31:27.419 --> 31:28.585
It doesn't live up
to the photographs

31:28.587 --> 31:30.254
from the museum archives.

31:30.256 --> 31:32.055
If this is a negotiation ploy...

31:32.057 --> 31:33.390
I don't need to negotiate.

31:33.392 --> 31:35.659
I either want a piece
or I don't.

31:35.661 --> 31:38.562
This piece, in person,
underwhelms.

31:38.564 --> 31:40.898
Maybe another deal, another day.

31:40.900 --> 31:42.266
Now, you listen to me.

31:42.268 --> 31:45.168
We had a deal.
You gave me your word.

31:45.170 --> 31:46.536
Mr. Copley.

31:46.538 --> 31:48.605
Sir, we have a situation.

31:48.607 --> 31:51.208
Can it wait?
No.

31:53.979 --> 31:56.079
Sir, there's a couple outside...

31:56.081 --> 31:58.148
claiming to be
Mr. and Mrs. Sampson.

32:00.653 --> 32:03.120
Well, that is ridiculous,
because we are the Sampsons.

32:03.122 --> 32:04.521
Are you?

32:04.523 --> 32:07.057
Or are you friends of the man
we caught here earlier?

32:07.059 --> 32:10.027
All of you trying
to steal what's mine?

32:10.029 --> 32:12.162
How dare you accuse us...
Open their bag.

32:14.133 --> 32:15.499
Give it to me.

32:17.303 --> 32:19.569
I suggest you hand it over.

32:31.617 --> 32:34.284
What the hell is this?

32:34.286 --> 32:35.719
There's no money
anywhere in there.

32:37.957 --> 32:39.489
Are you
playing games?

32:39.491 --> 32:41.525
Nothing but crackers.

32:41.527 --> 32:44.528
Richards, we're not
gonna lose this sale.

32:44.530 --> 32:46.296
Take the two of them
out the back

32:46.298 --> 32:47.664
and into the desert.

32:49.635 --> 32:50.634
Who knows?

32:50.636 --> 32:53.337
Maybe in 4,000 years time,

32:53.339 --> 32:54.705
someone will be digging you up.

33:01.714 --> 33:03.580
Okay, you got me.

33:03.582 --> 33:06.016
I was trying to steal from you.
But my wife

33:06.018 --> 33:07.417
had nothing to do with this.

33:09.488 --> 33:12.255
Well, then it's a shame
you're the reason she'll die.

33:14.159 --> 33:15.759
(whispers):
Okay, Paige, I need you to take

33:15.761 --> 33:17.294
one step closer to Tim.

33:19.732 --> 33:21.465
Now.

33:22.401 --> 33:25.268
(both grunting)

33:25.270 --> 33:27.404
Come on!

33:27.406 --> 33:29.306
Get after them!

33:29.308 --> 33:32.142
Okay, I'm gonna meet you guys
at the access road.

33:33.345 --> 33:35.545
(exclaims)
I'm stuck!

33:37.316 --> 33:39.483
Just pull your arm out.
There you go, come on .

33:45.491 --> 33:47.391
Hurry!

33:58.303 --> 34:00.270
(grunts)

34:00.272 --> 34:02.072
Paige!
(Paige gasping)

34:02.074 --> 34:03.206
Floor it!

34:08.380 --> 34:10.347
Paige, you okay?

34:10.349 --> 34:12.249
She's in shock,
we got to get her back to base.

34:12.251 --> 34:13.817
It's not gonna be that easy.
Look,

34:13.819 --> 34:17.220
on that
ridge ahead!

34:17.222 --> 34:18.588
They got automatic weapons.

34:18.590 --> 34:20.290
Put it in reverse.

34:20.292 --> 34:22.259
No, then we'll be headed
back to Copley!

34:22.261 --> 34:25.128
We passed the compound's
gas tank. Put it in reverse.

34:41.113 --> 34:43.213
(gunfire continuing)

34:43.215 --> 34:44.781
Cabe, gun.
Look, I know

34:44.782 --> 34:46.348
what you're thinking,
but a bullet's not gonna cause

34:46.351 --> 34:48.318
an explosion. That's why you need
to get the flare from the back.

34:48.320 --> 34:49.553
Toby.

34:50.456 --> 34:53.290
Guys, Paige is in bad shape.

34:53.292 --> 34:54.825
(gunfire continuing)

35:11.543 --> 35:12.742
Go forward!

35:23.655 --> 35:25.856
TOBY: Come on, Happy!
Get your booty in the car!

35:27.326 --> 35:29.826
(grunts)

35:36.401 --> 35:39.569
Oh! Oh, it's really sore.

35:39.571 --> 35:41.638
The ambassador's tailor
needs to make

35:41.640 --> 35:43.473
thicker bulletproof jackets.

35:43.475 --> 35:45.709
It's not like the movies. Rounds
don't just bounce off you,

35:45.711 --> 35:47.410
it's more like getting hit
with a sledgehammer.

35:47.412 --> 35:49.446
We'll ice it on the plane.

35:49.448 --> 35:51.915
Do you think it's gonna
play out like you planned?

35:51.917 --> 35:53.450
HAPPY:
It worked.

35:53.452 --> 35:54.451
They just completed the sale

35:54.453 --> 35:56.453
of the fake bowl
to the Sampsons.

35:56.455 --> 35:58.822
And our little light show
made the piece even sexier.

35:58.824 --> 36:00.790
Copley got an extra
two mil out of 'em.

36:00.792 --> 36:02.726
Well, he's not
gonna get to enjoy it.

36:02.728 --> 36:05.295
As soon as the Sampsons go
to have that bowl authenticated,

36:05.297 --> 36:06.763
his operation's
gonna be discredited

36:06.765 --> 36:08.498
and Copley'll be arrested
and tried.

36:08.500 --> 36:10.500
I look forward to telling
Jennings' widow that news.

36:10.502 --> 36:11.601
Thank you.

36:12.938 --> 36:14.671
CABE:
Let's pack it up.

36:14.673 --> 36:17.340
Major Janeway has the curator
of the North African

36:17.342 --> 36:19.276
Antiquities Museum heading over.

36:19.278 --> 36:20.777
We got a bowl to return.

36:25.851 --> 36:28.785
Listen, all I'm saying
is that I didn't lose the dare

36:28.787 --> 36:31.254
if the crackers, which were
the integral to the dare,

36:31.256 --> 36:32.522
were captured
by international criminals.

36:32.524 --> 36:34.925
I'll buy you some
more boxes tomorrow

36:34.927 --> 36:36.660
if it'll keep
that mouth closed.

36:36.662 --> 36:38.595
Doc, you got a second?

36:43.602 --> 36:45.569
What's up,
honey bear kitten pie?

36:45.571 --> 36:48.538
Nothing,
stupid dummy moron jerk.

36:48.540 --> 36:49.606
You know why I'm annoyed.

36:49.608 --> 36:50.941
I'm terrified that I don't.

36:50.943 --> 36:53.476
The Truth or Dare has to stop.

36:53.478 --> 36:55.412
It's like mental methadone.

36:55.414 --> 36:56.746
I need to
wean myself

36:56.748 --> 36:58.381
off of gambling.
I am still hooked

36:58.383 --> 36:59.916
on the endorphin rush.
You don't know how it feels.

37:01.687 --> 37:03.753
(piano tinkling off-key)

37:09.494 --> 37:10.827
Does it feel like that?

37:12.464 --> 37:15.498
Do you need to do
any more dares?

37:16.802 --> 37:18.868
Okay, then.

37:22.608 --> 37:24.507
(piano tinkles off-key)

37:24.509 --> 37:26.576
Oh, boy.

37:26.578 --> 37:29.613
This looks bad.

37:29.615 --> 37:32.315
Hey. I, uh,
I have something

37:32.317 --> 37:33.883
that might help with that.

37:33.885 --> 37:35.819
Oh, it's gruesome.
I'll try anything.

37:35.821 --> 37:38.922
It's a remedy that we use out in
the field when we get banged up.

37:38.924 --> 37:41.458
It's butter, honey and salt.
That's it.

37:41.460 --> 37:42.626
Okay.
Okay?

37:42.628 --> 37:44.661
All right. And it will

37:44.663 --> 37:47.597
help keep the swelling down

37:47.599 --> 37:49.466
and it will
help out infection.

37:49.468 --> 37:51.434
Thank you.

37:51.436 --> 37:54.638
Uh, thank you for, uh,
what you did for me today.

37:55.774 --> 37:57.641
I was just doing my job.

37:57.643 --> 37:58.642
Protecting my teammates.
That's it.

37:58.644 --> 38:00.810
Well, it's much appreciated.

38:00.812 --> 38:02.612
Look, really,

38:02.614 --> 38:04.914
it should be me
thanking you.

38:04.916 --> 38:06.716
I mean, if you wouldn't have
calmed me down when

38:06.718 --> 38:08.385
Copley was talking smack
about how he killed

38:08.387 --> 38:10.520
Jennings, I...

38:10.522 --> 38:12.522
I would've lost it.

38:12.524 --> 38:15.892
And we would not have
gotten out of there alive.

38:17.729 --> 38:20.597
I was just doing my job.

38:22.034 --> 38:23.900
You do it very well.

38:28.707 --> 38:30.307
You okay?

38:30.309 --> 38:31.541
Mm-hmm.

38:31.543 --> 38:34.311
(door opens)

38:39.484 --> 38:41.551
Evening.
Hey.

38:46.525 --> 38:47.991
Hey, where you been?

38:47.993 --> 38:50.593
Been trying to get ahold of you all day.
I was in Africa.

38:50.595 --> 38:52.962
I'm your attorney,
you don't have to lie to me.

38:52.964 --> 38:54.631
Anyway, I met
with the lawyers

38:54.633 --> 38:55.999
for the game shows.

38:56.001 --> 38:57.934
I laid out our legal argument,

38:57.936 --> 38:59.736
our statutory authority

38:59.738 --> 39:02.339
and I...
I set forth our demands.

39:02.341 --> 39:03.873
Perfect.
How did it go?

39:03.875 --> 39:05.842
Security threw me out.

39:05.844 --> 39:08.645
I have a court appearance next
week for disturbing the peace.

39:08.647 --> 39:12.649
Look, man, you-you seem
like a nice enough guy.

39:12.651 --> 39:16.519
Maybe you should, uh,
try hiring someone...

39:16.521 --> 39:18.888
like a real lawyer.

39:18.890 --> 39:21.591
Like someone who's
actually won a case.

39:21.593 --> 39:24.828
Yeah, I-I tried,
but nobody would take my case.

39:24.830 --> 39:26.596
Oh.

39:26.598 --> 39:29.399
Okay. Well....

39:29.401 --> 39:31.768
I'm really sorry I let you down.

39:40.679 --> 39:42.912
Hey, Heywood, hold on.

39:45.050 --> 39:46.549
You know,

39:46.551 --> 39:49.753
this whole building
is full of people who feel

39:49.755 --> 39:51.921
they didn't fit in
or couldn't do anything right

39:51.923 --> 39:54.824
or felt rudderless
at some point in their lives.

39:54.826 --> 39:57.994
But we were all given a chance
through Scorpion.

39:57.996 --> 40:00.597
Are you asking me
to join the team?

40:00.599 --> 40:01.765
I'm not a genius.

40:01.767 --> 40:03.066
That is abundantly clear.

40:03.068 --> 40:04.868
No. Wh-What I am offering

40:04.870 --> 40:06.770
is to keep you on as my lawyer.

40:06.772 --> 40:07.871
You do?

40:07.873 --> 40:11.574
I promise you will win
your first case.

40:11.576 --> 40:13.042
Deal?

40:13.044 --> 40:15.178
Yeah, deal.
Okay, come on,

40:15.180 --> 40:16.679
let's start brainstorming
some strategies.

40:16.681 --> 40:18.047
All right.

40:19.451 --> 40:21.418
Did some really
important work today.

40:21.420 --> 40:22.919
We did.
Any thoughts on our

40:22.921 --> 40:25.588
newest member?  Well,
he's probationary

40:25.590 --> 40:27.891
for Homeland,
not part of Scorpion.

40:27.893 --> 40:30.460
I thought he was competent,
he handled himself well,

40:30.462 --> 40:32.695
you two were able
to work together.

40:32.697 --> 40:34.097
I'm glad you're pleased.

40:34.099 --> 40:35.665
Normally I'd be impressed,

40:35.667 --> 40:37.467
but since I've met you,

40:37.469 --> 40:39.169
well, you've set the bar
so high.

40:40.672 --> 40:42.939
Did Toby tell you
I was threatened by you and Tim?

40:42.941 --> 40:43.973
On the flight back.

40:43.975 --> 40:47.644
Okay.
I don't feel jealousy.

40:47.646 --> 40:48.912
Jealousy is when you worry about

40:48.914 --> 40:50.513
how you compare to someone.

40:50.515 --> 40:52.515
But when your IQ

40:52.517 --> 40:56.486
puts you in
a one in 1.7 billion situation,

40:56.488 --> 40:58.154
no one can really compare.

40:58.156 --> 40:59.789
That's good to know.

40:59.791 --> 41:02.792
'Cause he could be around
for a bit.

41:06.765 --> 41:08.498
(Paige chuckles)

41:08.500 --> 41:10.200
Same spot, it's
kind of weird.

41:10.202 --> 41:12.068
Well, only got shot
a month ago, so, sure.

41:12.070 --> 41:14.137
(both speaking
indistinctly, chuckling)
