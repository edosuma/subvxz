WEBVTT

00:15.932 --> 00:18.184
Yes, I'm in front of the court now.

00:19.853 --> 00:21.688
Judge Cha? Why are you back?

00:21.771 --> 00:23.565
The evidence we got
from the investigation office

00:23.648 --> 00:25.316
for the Yeonhwa Child Murder.

00:25.400 --> 00:28.653
Please bring that
to the interrogation room now.

00:28.737 --> 00:32.282
Wait, Judge Cha. I'm on my way home now--

00:32.365 --> 00:34.367
Han Ye-eun is
in the interrogation room now.

00:35.368 --> 00:38.079
-Sorry?
-Han Ye-eun is in the interrogation room!

00:38.163 --> 00:40.248
Okay then. Wait, Judge Cha!

00:44.252 --> 00:46.254
Judge Sim. Well…

00:47.964 --> 00:49.132
Judge Sim. Your hand…

00:49.215 --> 00:50.717
Don't overreact. It's nothing.

00:53.011 --> 00:53.928
Okay.

00:54.596 --> 00:57.599
Well, I couldn't get a hold of
Han Ye-eun's guardian.

00:57.682 --> 00:58.850
But I'll try all means--

00:58.933 --> 01:00.477
I already did.

01:01.102 --> 01:01.936
How?

01:02.479 --> 01:03.730
I contacted her attorney.

01:04.314 --> 01:05.231
Her attorney?

01:05.774 --> 01:08.526
<i>Both of her parents are living in the US.</i>

01:08.610 --> 01:10.111
<i>Her father runs a business,</i>

01:10.195 --> 01:12.614
<i>and her mother operates
a popular boutique.</i>

01:12.697 --> 01:16.201
<i>For that reason, a law firm
takes care of her on their behalf.</i>

01:16.785 --> 01:19.287
<i>You've heard of the law firm Geobo, right?</i>

01:19.370 --> 01:20.663
<i>It's a big law firm.</i>

01:22.832 --> 01:24.626
PERSONAL INFORMATION
HAN YE-EUN, AGE 16

01:25.460 --> 01:29.047
I wondered what kind of clueless judge
would interrogate a minor at this hour.

01:29.130 --> 01:30.673
It was you, Eun-seok.

01:31.341 --> 01:34.260
I heard the news that
you work in juvenile courts now.

01:34.344 --> 01:37.514
Remember that you're here as an attorney,
Ms. Heo Chan-mi.

01:42.393 --> 01:43.853
Do you think this interrogation

01:44.938 --> 01:46.064
is some kind of joke?

01:52.862 --> 01:55.448
You may refuse to give a statement
or answer the questions

01:55.532 --> 01:56.950
I will ask from now on.

01:57.700 --> 01:59.410
Refusing to do so won't work against you.

01:59.494 --> 02:02.914
Anything you say from now on
can be used against you in a court of law.

02:03.748 --> 02:05.542
And you have a right to an attorney.

02:08.211 --> 02:09.212
Sign it.

02:16.094 --> 02:18.680
CONFIRMATION OF RIGHT TO
REFUSE TESTIMONY AND COUNSEL

02:23.560 --> 02:26.437
This isn't an interrogation
by an investigative body,

02:26.521 --> 02:29.107
but a court investigation
just to check up on some facts.

02:29.190 --> 02:30.900
There's no need to be scared.

02:32.318 --> 02:33.820
Thank you.

02:35.280 --> 02:36.531
Please begin.

02:36.614 --> 02:37.699
Baek Seong-u

02:38.783 --> 02:40.368
turned himself to the police.

02:42.120 --> 02:43.496
He said he killed someone.

02:45.373 --> 02:47.250
The victim attended
a nearby elementary school--

02:49.002 --> 02:50.128
Just cut to the chase.

02:50.211 --> 02:52.005
How do you know Baek Seong-u?

02:54.090 --> 02:55.091
I don't know him.

02:55.174 --> 02:56.551
Yet you ran away?

02:56.634 --> 02:59.929
Because I was scared.
You kept following me.

03:05.268 --> 03:06.394
Here.

03:07.061 --> 03:09.898
Here's the call record
between the two of you.

03:09.981 --> 03:11.399
She must have dialed the wrong number.

03:19.991 --> 03:22.368
By the number of calls she made,
it's almost as if she was stalking him.

03:23.912 --> 03:25.496
She'll remain silent.

03:25.580 --> 03:28.666
On the day of the murder,
around the estimated time of the incident,

03:28.750 --> 03:31.502
the only person who talked to him
on the phone was you.

03:32.378 --> 03:33.630
Do you really not know him?

03:33.713 --> 03:34.881
She'll remain silent.

03:34.964 --> 03:38.551
On December 13th, 2021,
where were you between 11 a.m. and 4 p.m.?

03:38.635 --> 03:41.137
-That too--
-I'm sure she'll remain silent again.

04:01.741 --> 04:02.909
Ye-eun.

04:07.830 --> 04:12.085
Baek Seong-u is a young offender
under the age of 14,

04:12.168 --> 04:14.003
so he can avoid criminal charges.

04:16.381 --> 04:17.840
But you're different.

04:18.508 --> 04:20.635
According to Articles 2 and 4
of the Act on Special Cases

04:20.718 --> 04:23.346
Concerning Punishment
for Specific Violent Crimes,

04:23.429 --> 04:27.308
the maximum sentence
for a juvenile is 20 years.

04:28.101 --> 04:30.019
I'm sure you're well aware of it too.

04:33.982 --> 04:36.234
Seong-u had his trial this afternoon.

04:37.568 --> 04:38.945
Guess what he said…

04:41.072 --> 04:43.199
after the trial?

04:51.833 --> 04:54.127
It's midnight, the appointed time.
This interrogation is over.

04:54.210 --> 04:55.211
Sit down.

04:55.295 --> 04:57.380
I'll ask one last question and wrap it up.

05:09.392 --> 05:11.561
This is the security footage

05:11.644 --> 05:14.439
from the elevator at the crime scene
on the day of the murder.

05:16.524 --> 05:18.318
But, Han Ye-eun.

05:19.152 --> 05:20.653
Why were you there?

05:27.285 --> 05:29.954
I just got on an elevator with him.

05:32.582 --> 05:33.708
Could that be a crime?

05:37.378 --> 05:40.590
<i>The calls between you and Seong-u
right before and after the incident,</i>

05:40.673 --> 05:44.886
<i>and the CCTV footage that shows you at
the scene on the day of the murder.</i>

05:45.678 --> 05:46.763
<i>All of this tells me</i>

05:46.846 --> 05:50.224
that it isn't a leap to say that
you're a coconspirator

05:51.017 --> 05:53.436
in this crime.

05:59.692 --> 06:02.403
You can't hold me here without a trial
just because you're a judge.

06:03.780 --> 06:04.989
It says on your record

06:05.073 --> 06:07.492
that you were placed under the maximum
2-year probation in your last trial.

06:07.575 --> 06:10.536
You didn't adhere to the conditions
and had an attitude problem too.

06:11.370 --> 06:12.413
You were in no position

06:13.456 --> 06:15.541
to be at an internet cafe at that hour.

06:17.919 --> 06:19.629
Let go of me! Let go!

06:20.213 --> 06:22.215
-Ms. Heo! Help me!
-You can't hurt her.

06:23.007 --> 06:25.760
-Be careful, please.
-Let me go!

06:25.843 --> 06:27.053
Can't you hear me?

06:35.353 --> 06:37.105
If you were going to take her anyway,

06:37.188 --> 06:40.066
you could've let her sleep
and taken her early tomorrow morning.

06:40.149 --> 06:42.110
-She's still a minor.
-But…

06:44.946 --> 06:46.906
Even if she's a minor…

06:48.908 --> 06:50.451
someone was killed.

06:51.911 --> 06:54.122
And that ruined a family.

06:55.206 --> 06:58.709
Why should it matter how well she sleeps?

07:02.004 --> 07:04.507
I just did my job as a judge.

07:06.551 --> 07:08.344
So you do your job…

07:10.263 --> 07:11.430
as her attorney.

07:30.241 --> 07:31.492
<i>Okay, I will.</i>

07:32.118 --> 07:34.537
I'll call you right away
if Presiding Judge Kang asks for you.

07:35.329 --> 07:36.164
Bye.

07:39.542 --> 07:40.668
You're up.

07:41.669 --> 07:43.504
I heard what happened
to Han Ye-eun last night.

07:43.588 --> 07:45.590
She was taken
to the Juvenile Classification Center.

07:46.632 --> 07:48.926
Don't forget to ask Judge Sim
when she comes to work

07:49.010 --> 07:50.970
because she's the one who caught her.

07:51.888 --> 07:53.723
She went through hoops to get her.

07:53.806 --> 07:55.600
Her hand was scraped and bandaged.

07:55.683 --> 07:56.684
No wonder.

07:56.767 --> 07:59.270
Judge Sim just called
and said she'd be a little late.

07:59.353 --> 08:00.771
Let her get some rest.

08:00.855 --> 08:03.274
It seems
she hasn't been sleeping much lately.

08:03.983 --> 08:05.693
-Is Presiding Judge Kang in?
-Not yet.

08:05.776 --> 08:08.029
Then please don't tell him.

08:11.699 --> 08:12.867
Come on!

08:22.668 --> 08:25.046
YUN JI-HU

08:32.011 --> 08:33.179
I'm off to work.

08:33.804 --> 08:35.932
Your mother will be here later.

08:37.099 --> 08:39.143
Eat something, please. Okay?

08:41.562 --> 08:43.314
You have to eat to live.

09:40.997 --> 09:41.956
Hi, it's me.

09:43.374 --> 09:44.500
Can you get it?

09:45.876 --> 09:48.129
No, the more cases, the better.

09:49.547 --> 09:52.758
I've looked up the domestic cases.
I just need examples from abroad.

09:52.842 --> 09:55.511
Mainly juvenile cases. Just not parricide.

09:56.095 --> 09:59.724
As soon as you get Han Ye-eun's records
from the Juvenile Classification Center,

09:59.807 --> 10:01.517
hand them over to Judge Sim right away.

10:01.601 --> 10:02.560
Yes, ma'am.

10:04.061 --> 10:06.897
By the way,
what on earth happened last night?

10:06.981 --> 10:08.232
Don't even get me started.

10:08.316 --> 10:09.692
I was on my way home,

10:09.775 --> 10:12.236
and Han Ye-eun was accompanied
by her attorney.

10:12.320 --> 10:13.904
It was no joke.

10:13.988 --> 10:15.656
Gosh, that's nuts.

10:15.740 --> 10:19.201
But, from the call history to the
security footage, there's solid evidence.

10:19.285 --> 10:21.120
I don't think she'll find a way out.

10:21.203 --> 10:22.830
Gosh, that's insane.

10:23.331 --> 10:26.792
It's like we're walking on thin ice since
Judge Sim transferred to our office.

10:27.668 --> 10:29.420
My gosh.

10:29.503 --> 10:32.340
What are we all going to do
if Presiding Judge Kang finds out?

10:32.423 --> 10:33.883
Find out about what?

10:35.301 --> 10:37.595
-Hello, sir.
-Jeez, look at your faces.

10:38.220 --> 10:39.305
Find out about what?

10:47.605 --> 10:49.231
Sim Eun-seok, speaking.

10:50.191 --> 10:51.359
I'm at the court now.

10:55.655 --> 10:57.239
Okay, I'll be right there.

10:58.115 --> 10:59.241
Cha Tae-ju!

11:00.117 --> 11:02.411
Don't you know what I'm like?

11:02.495 --> 11:05.331
Can't you see that
Sim Eun-seok is running wild?

11:05.414 --> 11:08.125
You can't let her do that!

11:08.209 --> 11:10.252
Sneaking around my back like rats!

11:11.045 --> 11:13.130
You summoned a minor
without reporting to me

11:13.214 --> 11:14.924
and sent her to the Classification Center.

11:15.007 --> 11:18.636
For goodness' sake.
You two must have gone mad.

11:18.719 --> 11:21.972
Hey! Do you think I'm a pushover?

11:22.056 --> 11:24.475
Get out! I don't need any of you!

11:25.267 --> 11:27.103
I was going to report it to you today.

11:27.186 --> 11:29.980
Why don't you just
hold the trial without me?

11:30.064 --> 11:31.482
I was ashamed.

11:31.565 --> 11:32.566
It was…

11:36.821 --> 11:39.156
They're not serial killers
or international scammers.

11:40.491 --> 11:42.201
They're just juvenile offenders.

11:42.284 --> 11:44.995
But they managed to fool the police
and played with the whole nation at large.

11:45.079 --> 11:46.914
The court should at least
find out the truth.

11:48.666 --> 11:50.000
Isn't that why we're here?

11:54.088 --> 11:55.005
<i>After all the trials are over,</i>

11:55.089 --> 11:57.967
<i>if they mock us thinking
that the law is a joke,</i>

11:58.050 --> 11:59.343
<i>what do we do then?</i>

12:00.052 --> 12:00.886
HUMAN

12:01.637 --> 12:04.849
<i>If they grow up
and create more victims like Ji-hu,</i>

12:06.142 --> 12:07.977
<i>who's going to take responsibility then?</i>

12:12.523 --> 12:14.525
We must show them how severe the law is!

12:14.608 --> 12:16.861
And teach them that there are consequences

12:17.445 --> 12:18.946
when they harm others.

12:20.573 --> 12:22.366
If their parents try to cover for them,

12:22.450 --> 12:24.702
the government
and the courts need to step in.

12:27.705 --> 12:29.290
Isn't that why we are all here?

12:31.125 --> 12:32.001
Tell me.

12:32.585 --> 12:34.253
What did I do wrong?

12:35.045 --> 12:38.507
What made you so upset
as far as to throwing those documents?

12:40.176 --> 12:41.218
As a judge…

12:43.053 --> 12:44.722
what on earth did I do wrong?

13:00.863 --> 13:03.699
So what are you planning to do?

13:04.700 --> 13:06.452
I'm going to use the law to prove it…

13:07.912 --> 13:09.163
mercilessly.

13:14.752 --> 13:16.462
Go see Baek Seong-u's mother.

13:17.505 --> 13:18.339
Now?

13:18.422 --> 13:21.133
What matters most right now is
Baek Seong-u's confession.

13:21.884 --> 13:23.844
Tell her that he has an accomplice

13:23.928 --> 13:26.639
and ask her if she can persuade him.

13:26.722 --> 13:27.848
Yes, ma'am.

13:33.646 --> 13:34.939
I'll see you then.

13:54.959 --> 13:57.419
I'm sorry, ma'am.
I should have kept my mouth shut.

13:57.503 --> 14:00.464
It doesn't matter. It was bound to happen.

14:00.548 --> 14:01.549
Okay.

14:02.383 --> 14:04.134
And…

14:04.218 --> 14:08.639
this is what the Juvenile Classification
Center got out of their investigation.

14:08.722 --> 14:11.058
It's Seong-u's conversation history
from his social media account.

14:11.141 --> 14:12.977
But the contents are a bit…

14:13.060 --> 14:14.895
I TOOK A KITTEN FROM ITS MOTHER
I'M GOING TO PRACTICE ON IT

14:14.979 --> 14:17.231
It seems these two
have a special relationship.

14:21.777 --> 14:22.778
Ma'am?

14:22.861 --> 14:23.821
Han Ye-eun…

14:25.072 --> 14:26.866
Call the Juvenile Classification Center

14:26.949 --> 14:29.326
and check if she has
any other social media history.

14:36.166 --> 14:38.502
IS HE ALIVE? DID YOU CHECK THE CCTV?
I'M NOT GOING TO BE INVOLVED, AM I?

14:38.586 --> 14:41.380
IT WON'T HAPPEN.
THANK GOD. YOU KNOW I LOVE YOU, RIGHT?

14:43.757 --> 14:46.927
Ma'am. I'll see you same time next week.

14:47.011 --> 14:49.555
Don't forget to finish your homework
by next week, Ye-chan.

14:49.638 --> 14:51.640
-Yes, ma'am.
-Thank you.

14:51.724 --> 14:52.766
-Bye.
-Bye.

14:52.850 --> 14:54.518
Goodbye.

15:16.332 --> 15:18.167
Are you trying to get me fired?

15:18.250 --> 15:19.877
How did you know I was here?

15:20.878 --> 15:22.838
What if rumors start to spread again?

15:23.464 --> 15:26.383
The cram school
you used to work for said you quit,

15:26.467 --> 15:28.594
so I contacted
the company you work for now.

15:28.677 --> 15:29.720
Is that what they said?

15:30.512 --> 15:31.805
That I quit?

15:33.182 --> 15:35.059
It's over for me if I get fired again.

15:35.142 --> 15:36.644
I have to make a living somehow.

15:37.519 --> 15:40.856
This isn't the first time
that he caused trouble.

15:40.940 --> 15:43.817
I'm not here to trouble you.

15:48.155 --> 15:49.365
By any chance,

15:50.115 --> 15:51.867
do you recognize this girl?

15:51.951 --> 15:52.910
No.

15:53.869 --> 15:54.745
Why?

15:54.828 --> 15:57.623
I think Seong-u was with her
at the crime scene.

15:59.583 --> 16:02.002
Then why…

16:02.711 --> 16:03.837
Why was Seong-u…

16:04.546 --> 16:05.631
I knew it.

16:05.714 --> 16:08.217
He doesn't have the guts to kill someone.

16:08.300 --> 16:10.260
She hasn't admitted to it yet.

16:12.846 --> 16:14.264
We need Seong-u's confession.

16:14.348 --> 16:15.641
And if he does?

16:15.724 --> 16:17.893
His sentence can change
depending on his statement.

16:17.977 --> 16:20.062
He will. I'll make him do it.

16:20.145 --> 16:22.940
I can't even reach the victim's parents.

16:23.023 --> 16:25.109
I can't even meet them,
let alone ask them to settle.

16:25.192 --> 16:27.319
What did his public defender say?

16:27.403 --> 16:29.488
"Public defender"?

16:34.576 --> 16:36.620
I've been ignoring calls
from unknown numbers.

16:37.579 --> 16:38.539
Here.

16:40.874 --> 16:43.460
This is the number.

16:44.628 --> 16:46.088
If you call this number,

16:47.464 --> 16:50.217
you can learn about his public defender.

16:52.886 --> 16:56.306
But you're a judge.
Why are you doing this?

16:56.390 --> 16:58.767
This is all a part of the job.

17:00.019 --> 17:01.729
Considering the gravity of the crime,

17:03.022 --> 17:04.857
Seong-u needs to defend himself too.

17:08.444 --> 17:09.445
Thank you.

17:11.864 --> 17:14.158
<i>Article 1 of the Juvenile Act says,</i>

17:14.241 --> 17:18.370
<i>"The purpose is to ensure
sound fostering of juveniles."</i>

17:19.038 --> 17:21.498
<i>It isn't just about who's in the wrong.</i>

17:21.582 --> 17:24.209
<i>The goal of
the Juvenile Criminal Collegiate Division</i>

17:24.293 --> 17:27.296
<i>is to ensure that the children
don't get involved in crime again.</i>

17:28.422 --> 17:31.008
<i>Please persuade him.</i>

18:06.877 --> 18:07.878
You're back.

18:11.507 --> 18:14.051
It seems you haven't been
sleeping the past few days.

18:14.134 --> 18:16.011
Why don't you go home and get some sleep?

18:28.816 --> 18:30.192
Didn't you tell me to go home?

18:31.819 --> 18:33.403
You are new to our division,

18:33.487 --> 18:35.114
but we didn't have a welcome party.

18:35.197 --> 18:37.157
No, I don't do that.

18:38.659 --> 18:40.536
I don't think you'd shed
a single drop of blood

18:40.619 --> 18:42.287
even if I pricked you with a needle.

18:43.497 --> 18:45.415
Mr. Seo told me you were late this morning

18:45.499 --> 18:48.293
because you stopped by the library,
not because you overslept.

18:50.838 --> 18:53.382
I have a question for you. Can I ask?

19:00.848 --> 19:02.349
Why here?

19:03.642 --> 19:05.894
We're not a high-profile division.

19:05.978 --> 19:09.231
Your experience here won't get you
a cushy job as a lawyer later.

19:09.857 --> 19:12.693
Everyone avoids coming here
because of the issues and the workload.

19:13.735 --> 19:16.530
You're a reputable judge.

19:16.613 --> 19:17.781
So, why…

19:19.408 --> 19:21.034
Why did you choose to come here?

19:35.340 --> 19:36.300
You're curious?

19:37.759 --> 19:38.635
Yes.

19:48.562 --> 19:49.521
Enjoy your food.

19:51.273 --> 19:52.191
Judge Sim.

19:57.696 --> 19:59.907
<i>We're not a high-profile division.</i>

19:59.990 --> 20:03.202
<i>Your experience here won't get you
a cushy job as a lawyer later.</i>

20:03.285 --> 20:06.121
<i>Everyone avoids coming here
because of the issues and the workload.</i>

20:06.205 --> 20:07.915
<i>Why did you choose to come here?</i>

20:12.544 --> 20:13.712
I wonder that myself.

20:29.561 --> 20:30.896
That's it.

20:33.148 --> 20:34.524
One more thing.

20:34.608 --> 20:36.693
The work in our division is one thing,

20:36.777 --> 20:40.906
but the juvenile protection cases
assigned to each of you are another.

20:40.989 --> 20:44.076
Those are independent trials,
so I can't intervene.

20:44.868 --> 20:47.120
But you better give it your best.

20:47.204 --> 20:48.580
-Yes, sir.
-Yes.

20:48.664 --> 20:50.791
I'm really sorry to interrupt the meeting,

20:50.874 --> 20:52.501
but this is quite serious.

20:52.584 --> 20:53.794
What is it?

20:56.004 --> 20:57.005
<i>Judge Sim Eun-seok</i>

20:57.089 --> 20:58.840
<i>of the Juvenile Criminal Collegiate
Division at Yeonhwa District Court,</i>

20:58.924 --> 21:02.386
<i>who was appointed
to handle the Yeonhwa child murder case,</i>

21:02.469 --> 21:05.222
<i>is having her qualifications
as a judge questioned.</i>

21:05.305 --> 21:10.018
<i>Since her days as a juvenile court judge
at Uijeongbu District Court two years ago,</i>

21:10.102 --> 21:12.562
<i>her overbearing attitude
and aggressive mannerisms</i>

21:12.646 --> 21:15.023
<i>have caused many controversies.</i>

21:15.107 --> 21:16.441
<i>She didn't curse,</i>

21:16.525 --> 21:19.403
<i>but she lashed out
at my child and yelled at him.</i>

21:19.486 --> 21:22.656
<i>I couldn't believe
such a person was a judge.</i>

21:22.739 --> 21:26.618
<i>Especially, during the investigation
into the Yeonhwa child murder case,</i>

21:26.702 --> 21:30.163
<i>when a child had refused the request
to attend the hearing voluntarily,</i>

21:30.247 --> 21:34.167
<i>she forcibly took the child
without a warrant, causing a controversy</i>

21:43.260 --> 21:44.803
No, well…

21:44.886 --> 21:46.972
The article was published
without checking the facts.

21:47.055 --> 21:51.018
No, she didn't forcibly take her.
She was accompanied by probation officers.

21:51.101 --> 21:53.020
It was a formal investigation.

21:53.770 --> 21:57.274
I didn't yell. I was just enunciating.
A formal investigation.

21:58.066 --> 21:59.943
JUDGE SIM'S QUALIFICATIONS
ARE BEING QUESTIONED

22:11.288 --> 22:13.415
Presiding Judge Kang.
The Chief Judge is asking for you.

22:31.266 --> 22:32.267
Look who's here.

22:33.060 --> 22:35.353
What brings you here, Your Honor?

22:36.480 --> 22:37.397
It was you.

22:38.148 --> 22:41.193
You're the only person
who would do this kind of thing.

22:41.276 --> 22:43.904
Yes, it's me. You told me

22:43.987 --> 22:45.614
that I should do my job.

22:46.490 --> 22:48.742
The whole world
should take this chance to learn

22:48.825 --> 22:50.410
what your true colors are.

22:52.120 --> 22:53.914
Your dirty tricks

22:54.873 --> 22:58.293
didn't work at the training institute,
and they won't work now.

22:59.211 --> 23:02.339
You lost then, and you'll lose again.

23:04.132 --> 23:06.718
Han Ye-eun will receive
a summons to appear in court.

23:07.511 --> 23:10.555
Bring her on time. Don't be a minute late.

23:11.473 --> 23:13.809
The reporters, that you love so much,
will be there.

23:21.983 --> 23:23.652
<i>What the heck is going on now?</i>

23:26.196 --> 23:28.657
You made me get summoned
by the Chief Judge!

23:29.241 --> 23:32.077
You're not even a junior judge!
You're a senior judge now!

23:39.417 --> 23:40.669
Why didn't you tell me?

23:40.752 --> 23:43.839
Didn't you think it'd cause problems

23:43.922 --> 23:45.966
when you forcibly
interrogated her like that?

23:50.428 --> 23:52.472
Tell Judge Cha to come to my office now.

24:08.613 --> 24:10.073
This case.

24:10.657 --> 24:12.742
I'm reassigning it to you.

24:15.745 --> 24:18.415
-Presiding Judge Kang--
-It's an order from the Chief Judge.

24:18.498 --> 24:21.668
I clearly warned you
that the justice department

24:21.751 --> 24:25.255
would be in the spotlight here,
so to act cautiously.

24:25.338 --> 24:26.423
I helped her.

24:27.674 --> 24:29.009
What?

24:29.092 --> 24:30.635
I was also suspicious of

24:30.719 --> 24:33.513
Han Ye-eun's whereabouts
on the day of the murder, so I--

24:36.016 --> 24:37.684
-Is that true?
-No, sir.

24:38.894 --> 24:41.188
I looked for Han Ye-eun alone that day.

24:42.105 --> 24:43.857
It was my sole decision.

24:44.858 --> 24:46.109
There's no excuse for that.

24:48.820 --> 24:51.948
Judge Cha, schedule a trial date
as soon as possible.

24:52.699 --> 24:53.575
And Judge Sim.

24:54.534 --> 24:55.911
Assist Judge Cha.

24:57.787 --> 24:58.747
Yes, sir.

25:05.003 --> 25:06.087
Why did you do that?

25:07.088 --> 25:09.758
I'm the one who told you
about that internet cafe.

25:09.841 --> 25:11.301
I went looking for her too.

25:12.594 --> 25:15.722
Why did you take all the blame?
You've worked so hard for this.

25:15.805 --> 25:16.890
So what?

25:16.973 --> 25:18.892
That doesn't make me innocent.

25:19.684 --> 25:21.978
What they said on the news wasn't wrong.

25:22.979 --> 25:24.522
It was my fault.

25:24.606 --> 25:25.607
But…

25:27.108 --> 25:31.321
despite all of that,
I wanted to catch her.

25:33.490 --> 25:36.201
If the case had been reassigned
to another team, it'd be a problem.

25:36.284 --> 25:39.204
But the presiding judge
being changed isn't a big deal.

25:40.455 --> 25:44.542
We can sacrifice an arm or two
since we're after the opponent's head.

25:47.337 --> 25:48.338
CASES INVOLVING SCHIZOPHRENIA

25:48.421 --> 25:49.881
These are the relevant cases I found.

25:49.965 --> 25:52.384
Stop worrying about me
and read as many as you can.

25:56.596 --> 25:59.557
Judge Sim. I just got a call
from the Juvenile Classification Center.

25:59.641 --> 26:01.268
Baek Seong-u wants to make a statement.

26:05.313 --> 26:09.359
<i>The trial for the Yeonhwa child murder,
a case that shocked the whole nation,</i>

26:09.442 --> 26:10.902
<i>will be held today.</i>

26:11.695 --> 26:14.948
<i>As Han, a third party caught on camera
on the day of the murder,</i>

26:15.031 --> 26:17.284
<i>is suspected to be the real culprit,</i>

26:17.367 --> 26:20.120
<i>the prosecution has filed
a murder charge against her.</i>

26:20.203 --> 26:22.205
The suspects for the murder
of Yeonhwa elementary school child…

26:22.289 --> 26:24.332
…are being held today
for the two teenagers.

26:24.416 --> 26:26.418
-…today at 2 p.m.
-They need to be punished!

26:26.501 --> 26:27.335
-Abolish!
-Abolish!

26:27.419 --> 26:30.171
<i>The court will hold
a criminal trial of Han</i>

26:30.255 --> 26:34.342
<i>and a juvenile trial
of Baek simultaneously.</i>

26:34.426 --> 26:36.803
<i>Everyone is eagerly awaiting
the results of the trial.</i>

26:36.886 --> 26:38.138
<i>Do you admit that she was taken forcibly?</i>

26:38.221 --> 26:41.725
What does the court
have to say about the case?

26:41.808 --> 26:44.311
The trial will be held
behind closed doors.

26:44.394 --> 26:45.937
The Yeonhwa Child Murder…

26:53.820 --> 26:57.240
<i>Case Number 2021P2598.</i>

26:57.324 --> 26:59.993
<i>and 2021CC2611.</i>

27:00.660 --> 27:02.454
<i>We'll begin the trial now.</i>

27:13.256 --> 27:14.424
Han Ye-eun's attorney.

27:16.926 --> 27:18.845
Is her guardian not here today?

27:18.928 --> 27:21.639
Han Ye-eun's guardians were unable
to attend due to business in the US,

27:21.723 --> 27:24.017
so their counsel is here on their behalf.

27:24.100 --> 27:26.770
I've been a judge for 22 years,

27:26.853 --> 27:30.357
but I've never seen this kind of attorney
dream team at juvenile court before.

27:30.440 --> 27:31.816
We'll take it as a compliment.

27:37.614 --> 27:38.740
Han Ye-eun's attorney.

27:39.407 --> 27:41.910
Does she admit to murdering
and abandoning the body?

27:41.993 --> 27:44.579
She admits to it partially
but not to everything.

27:44.662 --> 27:46.373
As Baek Seong-u stated,

27:46.456 --> 27:49.000
she admits to murdering the victim
and abandoning their body.

27:49.084 --> 27:53.505
But it wasn't premeditated.
It's manslaughter due to mental health.

27:55.799 --> 27:56.925
Baek Seong-u's public defender.

27:59.344 --> 28:01.346
Does he admit to being an accomplice?

28:01.429 --> 28:02.847
He doesn't admit it, either.

28:04.849 --> 28:08.019
He gave his statement
regarding the crime, didn't he?

28:08.103 --> 28:09.938
He did, but he wasn't her accomplice.

28:10.021 --> 28:11.898
He only abetted the murder.

28:11.981 --> 28:13.108
On what basis?

28:13.191 --> 28:17.362
Until Han Ye-eun actually committed murder
at Baek Seong-u's apartment,

28:17.445 --> 28:20.949
Baek Seong-u thought
this whole ordeal was a joke.

28:29.541 --> 28:30.417
Ye-eun.

28:32.502 --> 28:33.753
Is your address

28:34.337 --> 28:38.591
Capital Palace, unit 103, apartment 3201?

28:39.717 --> 28:40.677
Sorry?

28:40.760 --> 28:46.224
Is your address Capital Palace,
unit 103, apartment 3201?

28:47.225 --> 28:48.143
Yes.

28:48.226 --> 28:50.353
Yes, when someone asks for your address,

28:50.437 --> 28:55.066
people normally answer yes or no
just like you did, right?

28:56.067 --> 28:58.486
-Yes.
-And people ask this question

28:58.570 --> 29:04.159
when they're planning to visit
or send something.

29:04.242 --> 29:05.076
Is that right?

29:06.745 --> 29:07.829
Probably.

29:07.912 --> 29:13.334
But why did Baek Seong-u reply with,

29:14.085 --> 29:15.879
"Is he alive? Did you check the CCTV?"

29:20.300 --> 29:24.679
They exchanged messages
on social media at 11:28 a.m.

29:33.229 --> 29:36.775
YOUR ADDRESS IS UNIT 101,
APARTMENT 1402, RIGHT?

29:37.650 --> 29:38.485
IS HE ALIVE? DID YOU CHECK THE CCTV?

29:38.568 --> 29:42.739
The elevator CCTV footage
was captured at 11:29 a.m.

29:47.160 --> 29:51.206
The CCTV footage and the conversation
tell us two things.

29:51.289 --> 29:55.543
First, the person who lured
the victim to the crime scene

29:55.627 --> 29:59.798
wasn't Baek Seong-u, but Han Ye-eun.

29:59.881 --> 30:00.715
<i>Hey.</i>

30:02.759 --> 30:03.593
<i>Second.</i>

30:03.676 --> 30:06.930
"Is he alive? Did you check the CCTV?"

30:07.013 --> 30:08.598
This reply from Baek Seong-u

30:11.643 --> 30:15.313
shows that they conspired
to commit the crime.

30:17.565 --> 30:22.195
Even if Han Ye-eun lured the victim
into Baek Seong-u's apartment,

30:22.278 --> 30:26.282
it's difficult to tell
whether he took it as a joke or not.

30:27.826 --> 30:29.828
Baek Seong-u's public defender.
What do you think?

30:32.163 --> 30:34.624
<i>I'm sure they'll claim it was accidental.</i>

30:35.208 --> 30:37.961
They can't deny abduction, murder,
and mutilation and disposal

30:38.044 --> 30:40.004
because Baek Seong-u
already confessed to them.

30:40.088 --> 30:42.882
The only thing left for Baek Seong-u is
whether he's an accomplice or an abettor.

30:42.966 --> 30:46.177
And, for Han Ye-eun, it's whether
this was premeditated or accidental.

30:47.345 --> 30:50.723
They'll claim that it was abetted
and that it was an accident respectively.

30:50.807 --> 30:53.309
Then we need to see
if their claims are legitimate

30:53.393 --> 30:55.562
or if there are any holes
in their arguments.

30:56.521 --> 30:58.648
Witness. How do you know Han Ye-eun?

30:58.731 --> 31:01.401
I'm a psychiatrist,

31:01.484 --> 31:04.612
and I've been Han Ye-eun's doctor
for about three years.

31:04.696 --> 31:06.281
How's her condition?

31:06.364 --> 31:08.950
WITNESS STAND

31:11.786 --> 31:15.790
In other words,
she suffers from depressive behavior,

31:15.874 --> 31:18.543
weakness of the nerves,
and persistent delusions.

31:18.626 --> 31:22.297
Persistent delusions? Please elaborate.

31:22.380 --> 31:25.842
Well, there are many types
of delusional disorders.

31:25.925 --> 31:28.553
In Han Ye-eun's case, it was persecutory.

31:28.636 --> 31:32.056
In other words, she was paranoid.

31:33.016 --> 31:36.477
<i>Persecutory delusional patients interpret</i>

31:36.561 --> 31:40.815
<i>other people's actions as threats,
slander, or harassment,</i>

31:40.899 --> 31:43.610
<i>and respond to them instantly.</i>

31:45.278 --> 31:46.237
Sorry.

32:06.549 --> 32:08.801
<i>Depending on their delusions,</i>

32:08.885 --> 32:11.804
<i>they can have a hard time
controlling their anger.</i>

32:11.888 --> 32:15.224
Then is it possible
that this case happened

32:15.308 --> 32:17.518
because of her
persecutory delusional disorder?

32:17.602 --> 32:20.772
Whatever the case,
I can't be 100 percent certain.

32:20.855 --> 32:23.274
What about the possibility?

32:23.358 --> 32:27.528
If you put it that way,
then it is possible.

32:28.237 --> 32:29.155
That will be all.

32:44.504 --> 32:47.924
We'll resume the trial
after a one-hour recess.

32:58.851 --> 33:01.354
At this rate, this can go on forever.

33:01.437 --> 33:03.106
Han Ye-eun's attorney

33:03.189 --> 33:06.192
seemed to be quite prepared
to claim it was accidental.

33:12.824 --> 33:14.867
WITNESS STAND

33:16.577 --> 33:17.495
Baek Seong-u.

33:19.038 --> 33:20.581
Do you know what that is?

33:23.668 --> 33:26.004
-It's the charger cable for my cell phone.
-And…

33:26.087 --> 33:28.631
it was also the murder weapon
used in killing the victim, right?

33:29.924 --> 33:31.217
Yes.

33:32.343 --> 33:34.554
Can you tell us what happened at the time?

33:36.556 --> 33:37.807
Hey.

33:37.890 --> 33:39.559
<i>As I said earlier,</i>

33:40.143 --> 33:42.812
I didn't see Han Ye-eun kill that boy

33:43.438 --> 33:45.690
because I was getting changed
in another room.

33:45.773 --> 33:46.733
But…

33:47.942 --> 33:49.235
<i>How about this?</i>

33:49.318 --> 33:53.531
Why don't we pit Baek Seong-u
against Han Ye-eun

33:57.076 --> 34:00.038
and make them reveal the truth
about each other?

34:03.708 --> 34:04.876
<i>Did you really kill him?</i>

34:04.959 --> 34:07.170
Hey, you crazy bitch! Answer me! Fuck!

34:11.716 --> 34:12.967
Both of us…

34:14.886 --> 34:16.179
don't have to go to jail.

34:17.764 --> 34:18.681
We both…

34:20.767 --> 34:22.060
can get away with this.

34:25.438 --> 34:26.898
<i>Are you saying</i>

34:26.981 --> 34:28.900
Han Ye-eun was the one who started this?

34:30.151 --> 34:32.779
Yes. She said there was a way.

34:32.862 --> 34:36.240
She removed her fingerprints
from the charger cable and put mine on it.

34:36.324 --> 34:38.534
She said she had a plan
and I just had to follow it.

34:43.956 --> 34:48.127
So, who came up with the idea
of mutilating the body?

34:57.345 --> 34:58.346
Baek Seong-u.

35:01.182 --> 35:02.725
He told me to do it.

35:04.477 --> 35:06.771
I was distressed

35:07.522 --> 35:08.731
after killing the kid.

35:12.235 --> 35:14.070
Then he told me to do it.

35:16.364 --> 35:17.740
He instructed me

35:19.283 --> 35:22.912
<i>on how to slice the body into pieces
from outside the bathroom.</i>

35:22.995 --> 35:26.374
And he told me to throw away the organs
in the food waste bin

35:29.377 --> 35:30.503
and the body pieces

35:31.838 --> 35:33.881
<i>in the rooftop water tank.</i>

35:35.842 --> 35:38.427
-He threatened me.
-Hey, it was your idea!

35:38.511 --> 35:40.263
You told me we had to avoid the cameras!

35:40.346 --> 35:41.764
That's all a lie!

35:41.848 --> 35:44.308
-She did it herself!
-I'm telling the truth!

35:44.392 --> 35:47.687
You told me how from outside the bathroom!

35:47.770 --> 35:49.021
Hey, you said you'd do it!

35:49.105 --> 35:51.691
I said we should turn ourselves in,
but you said you wanted to try it!

35:51.774 --> 35:54.235
-When did I say that?
-Are you serious?

35:54.318 --> 35:57.321
What the fuck!
You're the one who picked that ax!

35:57.405 --> 36:00.241
You even danced around
after you killed him.

36:00.324 --> 36:01.284
When did I do that?

36:01.367 --> 36:04.745
She chopped him up with an ax
and started dancing when she saw blood!

36:04.829 --> 36:06.330
She's crazy, I'm telling you!

36:06.414 --> 36:08.040
Shut up, you son of a bitch!

36:08.124 --> 36:09.542
Fuck, I'll kill you!

36:09.625 --> 36:11.794
Please, stop!

36:20.928 --> 36:22.847
Please, stop.

36:24.807 --> 36:25.975
Please.

36:29.228 --> 36:30.897
Honey.

36:30.980 --> 36:32.190
Honey!

36:45.870 --> 36:50.082
My baby! Ji-hu…

37:25.117 --> 37:26.202
<i>Due to Baek Seong-u</i>

37:26.285 --> 37:28.496
and Han Ye-eun's voluntary confession,

37:28.579 --> 37:31.415
it will be meaningless
to proceed with this trial any further.

37:33.042 --> 37:35.586
And, lastly, the victim…

37:38.506 --> 37:39.799
Yun Ji-hu's mother.

37:41.592 --> 37:45.721
So you won't have any regrets later,

37:45.805 --> 37:48.182
would you care to say a few words

37:49.684 --> 37:51.018
if you have anything to say?

37:57.858 --> 37:59.527
Paranoia?

38:00.569 --> 38:01.988
Schizophrenia?

38:03.406 --> 38:05.074
I don't care about any of that.

38:08.035 --> 38:09.662
What matters to me is…

38:12.206 --> 38:14.083
What's clear is…

38:16.210 --> 38:17.712
that my son…

38:20.881 --> 38:22.383
trembled in fear…

38:24.927 --> 38:27.722
without his mom in a stranger's house…

38:31.350 --> 38:33.144
and left this world.

38:45.531 --> 38:47.283
I still…

38:49.535 --> 38:51.829
don't understand…

38:53.956 --> 38:54.999
why…

38:57.293 --> 38:59.920
my innocent son

39:01.380 --> 39:03.132
had to die like that.

39:10.639 --> 39:12.224
Your Honor.

39:14.894 --> 39:16.020
Please…

39:17.646 --> 39:20.316
punish them severely…

39:22.693 --> 39:24.904
so something like this won't happen again.

40:17.373 --> 40:18.833
Whatever the reason was,

40:20.209 --> 40:22.545
they committed a heinous crime.

40:22.628 --> 40:25.548
We should sentence Han Ye-eun
to a maximum 20-year sentence,

40:26.632 --> 40:29.718
and sentence Baek Seong-u
with the maximum sentence

40:30.428 --> 40:32.596
we can give him at his age.

40:36.559 --> 40:37.810
The maximum is…

40:39.395 --> 40:41.313
two years at a juvenile reformatory.

40:45.276 --> 40:46.527
What do you think, Judge Cha?

40:47.278 --> 40:50.406
I also think we should sentence
Han Ye-eun to 20 years.

40:52.450 --> 40:53.742
And for Seong-u…

40:56.245 --> 40:57.746
<i>The court has made its decision.</i>

40:58.414 --> 41:02.835
The offenders targeted
an innocent stranger for murder

41:02.918 --> 41:06.172
and treated him like an object.

41:06.797 --> 41:11.594
They murdered him brutally
just for the sake of killing.

41:12.344 --> 41:15.473
This was an especially heinous crime

41:15.556 --> 41:18.851
that shocked and frightened parents who

41:18.934 --> 41:20.644
have elementary school-aged children.

41:20.728 --> 41:22.688
The court sentences Han Ye-eun
to 20 years,

41:22.771 --> 41:24.732
the maximum sentence
for juvenile offenses,

41:27.610 --> 41:30.446
and Baek Seong-u to two years
in the juvenile reformatory.

41:31.071 --> 41:31.947
No!

41:32.615 --> 41:34.992
-They can't do this to me!
-Don't do this.

41:35.075 --> 41:36.952
-How can I get 20 years?
-Stop it!

41:37.036 --> 41:39.079
Don't touch me!

41:39.163 --> 41:42.750
Let me go! Don't order me around,
you lousy lawyer!

41:43.417 --> 41:46.462
Let go! Let go of me, you bastards!

41:46.545 --> 41:49.006
-You bastards! I'll kill you all!
-Seong-u. I'll come to visit. Don't worry.

41:49.089 --> 41:53.761
-Let go of me! Let go! I'm innocent!
-Don't worry. Okay?

42:24.208 --> 42:27.253
Baek Seong-u is pushing to appeal.
What is Miss Han going to do?

42:27.336 --> 42:30.673
She won't accept the court's decision.
She'll appeal against it.

42:30.756 --> 42:32.550
-Does she deny all charges?
-Please, comment.

42:35.553 --> 42:37.638
Wait! Wait, ma'am!

42:41.392 --> 42:42.434
This is from the judge.

42:50.317 --> 42:51.402
Hello, Ms. Joo?

42:52.278 --> 42:53.195
I'll be right there.

42:55.823 --> 42:58.826
I'm sorry. I'm quite behind with work.
Bye then.

42:59.910 --> 43:00.828
Right.

43:01.412 --> 43:03.664
It's from Judge Sim.

43:57.676 --> 44:01.388
Han Ye-eun won't ever change, will she?

44:02.139 --> 44:05.184
Do you think a prison sentence
is really the best for someone like her?

44:06.894 --> 44:08.687
It’s the least the court can do.

44:10.189 --> 44:11.523
Even though we're judges,

44:12.691 --> 44:14.610
we can't change who she is inside.

44:15.194 --> 44:16.278
I'm just worried.

44:17.279 --> 44:19.907
She'll serve out her sentence
and grow into an adult.

44:21.617 --> 44:22.785
What happens after that?

44:23.494 --> 44:24.995
That's up to her parents.

44:26.997 --> 44:29.792
If only they could make her realize
how serious her crime is.

44:31.794 --> 44:33.003
But…

44:34.380 --> 44:37.007
that won't happen.

44:40.260 --> 44:43.430
<i>She committed such a heinous crime,</i>

44:44.139 --> 44:46.308
<i>but her parents
didn't even attend the trial.</i>

44:47.851 --> 44:49.520
<i>If the parents don't make an effort,</i>

44:51.605 --> 44:53.315
<i>their children will never change.</i>

44:56.902 --> 45:01.490
Can I borrow your phone?

45:01.573 --> 45:03.075
I have to call my mom.

45:06.370 --> 45:07.287
Mom?

45:42.114 --> 45:43.949
MINISTRY OF JUSTICE

45:48.328 --> 45:49.371
Judge Cha!

45:49.955 --> 45:52.916
You said you'd reduce the punishment.
How can you do this to me?

45:53.000 --> 45:56.128
You said you'd reduce the punishment.
You told me that.

45:56.211 --> 45:58.297
You even introduced me
to his public defender.

45:58.380 --> 46:01.341
You said the judges weren't the enemy.

46:01.425 --> 46:04.261
But why didn't you release Seong-u?

46:04.344 --> 46:06.472
He wasn't the one who killed the boy!

46:08.015 --> 46:09.516
What I meant was…

46:09.600 --> 46:12.102
Release Seong-u! Release him right now.

46:12.186 --> 46:14.271
You said you'd release him.
Why did you lock him up?

46:14.354 --> 46:16.023
Because the boy was killed
in your apartment.

46:17.900 --> 46:19.026
But your son

46:20.319 --> 46:23.030
didn't call the police
and even helped her.

46:24.865 --> 46:26.533
Your son

46:28.035 --> 46:29.912
caused confusion to the investigation

46:31.038 --> 46:32.956
and even turned himself in falsely.

46:35.209 --> 46:36.835
For those reasons,

46:38.754 --> 46:40.297
he has to be held responsible.

46:44.760 --> 46:46.011
Judge Sim.

46:47.137 --> 46:49.181
There's an old saying that goes,

46:50.307 --> 46:52.351
"The pain of a mother who loses her child

46:53.977 --> 46:56.480
is as severe as
that of her innards splitting."

47:02.069 --> 47:04.488
What did you do for Seong-u
when he was nine?

47:06.823 --> 47:08.200
When Ji-hu was nine…

47:11.495 --> 47:12.621
Ji-hu's mother…

47:15.749 --> 47:17.125
lost her child…

47:20.629 --> 47:22.548
because of your son.

47:55.539 --> 47:56.748
Judge Sim.

47:59.251 --> 48:00.502
That wasn't what I meant.

48:02.045 --> 48:05.340
I understand why you said that.

48:06.091 --> 48:07.593
And you weren't wrong.

48:08.260 --> 48:09.219
But…

48:10.345 --> 48:12.681
if the guardian took your words
the wrong way,

48:14.433 --> 48:16.184
you, as a judge, are the one to blame.

48:18.395 --> 48:19.438
I'll be careful.

48:32.367 --> 48:33.702
No matter how many I take…

48:37.289 --> 48:39.124
I just can't get used to juvenile cases.

48:42.169 --> 48:43.962
They always leave me feeling disturbed.

48:49.593 --> 48:52.638
Go home early today. Get some rest.

48:54.264 --> 48:56.475
Only then can we prepare
for the next trial.

49:01.188 --> 49:02.314
Good work.

49:30.425 --> 49:33.011
JI-HU'S BABY BOOK

49:48.402 --> 49:49.444
Aren't you coming?

49:59.663 --> 50:01.289
<i>I wish I had kept writing this.</i>

50:02.958 --> 50:05.252
I wish I had written in it every day.

50:33.280 --> 50:34.948
Is this for me?

50:36.116 --> 50:39.202
Do you like it? That's from Ji-hu.

50:39.286 --> 50:40.912
Say thank you to her.

50:42.164 --> 50:43.749
Thank you.

50:44.624 --> 50:48.962
Where's Ji-hu? I should thank him too.

50:53.717 --> 50:56.928
What are you going to say to Ji-hu?

50:57.637 --> 50:59.473
"Thank you, Ji-hu."

51:08.398 --> 51:11.026
I wanted to hug him so badly,

51:12.652 --> 51:14.321
but I couldn't.

51:19.743 --> 51:23.830
I should be the one thanking you.
Thank you for welcoming his toy.

51:25.499 --> 51:29.336
Thank you so much.

52:20.136 --> 52:21.638
WHEN SEONG-U LOST HIS BABY TEETH

52:21.721 --> 52:22.889
SEONG-U'S TALENT SHOW

52:47.414 --> 52:49.666
<i>What did you do for Seong-u
when he was nine?</i>

52:51.042 --> 52:52.377
<i>When Ji-hu was nine,</i>

52:53.253 --> 52:56.798
Ji-hu's mother lost her child…

53:00.343 --> 53:02.178
because of your son.

53:32.751 --> 53:35.170
I'm sorry.

53:37.172 --> 53:38.673
I'm sorry.

53:40.175 --> 53:43.219
I'm the one to blame.

53:43.970 --> 53:44.930
It's…

53:46.097 --> 53:48.808
It's all my fault.

54:06.534 --> 54:07.869
<i>No matter how many I take…</i>

54:09.829 --> 54:11.665
<i>I just can't get used to juvenile cases.</i>

54:13.375 --> 54:15.168
<i>They always leave me feeling disturbed.</i>

54:19.923 --> 54:22.550
