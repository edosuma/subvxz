00:11.834 --> 00:14.250
Decision's made.
Merc's out.

00:14.542 --> 00:15.792
When are you
going to tell him?

00:15.792 --> 00:19.333
I thought I'd wait
till after his
Man of the Year thing.

00:19.834 --> 00:21.166
That's nice.
Also that way,

00:21.166 --> 00:23.041
we can empty out his office
while he's there.

00:23.041 --> 00:24.709
Do you know who
you're going to go with?

00:24.709 --> 00:26.375
We've got
a very short list.

00:26.375 --> 00:27.500
Right.

00:27.500 --> 00:28.750
And your name's
at the top of it.

00:29.333 --> 00:30.917
Uh, I'm about to
leave for my date.

00:30.917 --> 00:33.917
Okay.
If you don't
want me to go,

00:33.917 --> 00:35.291
I won't go.

00:35.875 --> 00:37.125
Go.

00:39.625 --> 00:41.291
LABIA: LeBlanc residence.

00:41.291 --> 00:42.375
Is Matt there?

00:42.375 --> 00:44.917
Oh, hi, Diane.
It's Labia.

00:45.542 --> 00:47.166
MATT: No!

00:49.667 --> 00:51.166
Fuck!

01:00.834 --> 01:02.291

01:31.542 --> 01:33.125

01:40.333 --> 01:41.750
How can I take this job?

01:41.750 --> 01:44.333
How?
I can't do that to him.

01:44.709 --> 01:47.250
It sounds like
they're doing it to him
whether you do it or not.

01:47.250 --> 01:49.709
No, I know, but...
I, I, I...

01:49.709 --> 01:51.000
This is your dream!

01:51.000 --> 01:54.125
It's what you've been
working for
your entire career.

01:54.125 --> 01:56.208
I know, but...

01:56.792 --> 01:58.834
He would
never understand.

01:59.083 --> 02:01.792
I don't think
our relationship
could survive it.

02:02.125 --> 02:03.959
So?
So!

02:03.959 --> 02:06.291
A couple weeks ago
you were prepared
to end it

02:06.291 --> 02:09.250
and there wasn't
even a dream job
on the table.

02:11.542 --> 02:13.917
He's never going to
leave her, is he?
(SIGHS)

02:16.667 --> 02:18.125
No.

02:18.458 --> 02:19.792
(SIGHS)

02:19.792 --> 02:24.417
Because she's a fucking saint,
a fucking blind saint.

02:25.000 --> 02:26.583
Hmm.
What?

02:28.166 --> 02:29.625
What?

02:29.625 --> 02:31.291
That "Hmm."

02:32.959 --> 02:35.542
What "Hmm"?
Uh, no, no.

02:35.959 --> 02:37.625
I said that
she's a fucking saint,

02:37.625 --> 02:39.792
and you went "Hmm",

02:39.792 --> 02:43.333
like maybe she's not
such a fucking saint.

02:44.625 --> 02:49.625
Oh, no, it was just
an "Hmm."

02:49.625 --> 02:54.166
Like, "Hmm, go on."
So... Hmm.

02:54.166 --> 02:55.500
Go on.

02:55.959 --> 02:57.792
What aren't you
telling me?
Nothing.

02:58.333 --> 02:59.458
Tell me.

02:59.959 --> 03:02.959
You... Well...
You've never moved
this fast in your life.

03:02.959 --> 03:04.333
So, you need
to tell me.

03:04.333 --> 03:08.000
Look, I know nothing!
It was just an... Hmm.

03:08.333 --> 03:10.125
You like poison ivy?

03:10.125 --> 03:11.500
There's plenty of it
up there.

Come on, come on!

03:26.917 --> 03:29.375
Oh, what are you
gonna do? Huh?

03:30.250 --> 03:31.834
I got ya.
(PANTING)

03:33.000 --> 03:34.875

Keep moving.

03:36.667 --> 03:37.875
Tell me.

03:37.875 --> 03:40.166
(BREATHING HEAVILY)

03:43.125 --> 03:45.667
She's having an affair
with Matt.

03:45.667 --> 03:46.875
Who?

03:47.583 --> 03:50.000
Saint Jamie.

03:52.333 --> 03:53.875
Is having an affair?

03:53.875 --> 03:56.333
With Matt LeBlanc.

03:57.333 --> 03:58.875
(CHUCKLES)

03:58.875 --> 04:01.500
No. No!

04:01.500 --> 04:04.083
Oh, my God. No!

04:04.083 --> 04:07.250
You knew this
and you didn't tell me?

04:07.500 --> 04:10.542
What about all the shit
with our show
you don't tell me?

04:11.125 --> 04:13.542
That's work!
This is my life!

04:13.542 --> 04:17.875
I know!
But if I told you,
you'd tell Merc!

04:17.875 --> 04:20.250
I have to tell Merc!
You can't tell Merc!

04:20.250 --> 04:21.583
If you tell Merc,

04:21.583 --> 04:27.750
this whole thing will blow up
and Matt will kill me.

04:29.041 --> 04:31.000
(WHISPERING)
You must keep this
to yourself.

04:31.333 --> 04:33.375
Yeah, I can't do that.

04:36.291 --> 04:39.375
If you tell Merc,
I swear I'll...

04:41.750 --> 04:42.917
I will tell him

04:42.917 --> 04:45.125
that you've been having
secret meetings with that...

04:45.125 --> 04:47.125
That Salad person,

04:47.125 --> 04:50.917
and that you knew
he was getting fired
before he did

04:50.917 --> 04:52.333
and you didn't tell him.

04:52.333 --> 04:53.417
Ha!

04:58.792 --> 04:59.917
(GRUNTS ANGRILY)

For all I know,
it's already over.

05:18.458 --> 05:22.250
Last I heard he was
having a thing
with his stalker.

05:22.542 --> 05:23.792
Jesus!

05:23.792 --> 05:26.792
A stalker
and his boss's blind wife.

05:26.792 --> 05:28.792

stick it anywhere.

05:43.625 --> 05:44.917
Hey. What's up?

05:45.375 --> 05:47.667
I just got a call
from Diane's lawyer.

05:48.166 --> 05:49.750
What'd that prick want?

05:49.750 --> 05:51.959
Please tell me
you weren't entertaining
your stalker

05:51.959 --> 05:53.667
at your house
last night.

05:54.250 --> 05:56.542
Okay, I was not
entertaining her.

05:57.208 --> 05:58.750
Technically, yeah,
she was here.

05:58.750 --> 06:01.041
But I was throwing her out
when Diane called.

06:01.041 --> 06:02.792
So she broke in again?

06:02.792 --> 06:05.250
Uh, technically, no.

06:05.667 --> 06:08.750
So, why don't you tell me
what did happen. Technically.

06:08.750 --> 06:12.166
All right, the other night,
I was pretty hammered,

06:12.166 --> 06:13.375
and I called her up...

06:13.375 --> 06:15.000
Diane?
No.

06:15.291 --> 06:18.125
You called up your stalker.
Right.

06:18.709 --> 06:21.208
The one we got
the restraining order for.

06:21.792 --> 06:22.959
Yeah.

06:22.959 --> 06:25.000
Did you have sexual
relations with her?

06:25.667 --> 06:27.959
Hmm...
Does anal...

06:27.959 --> 06:29.375
Yeah, it counts.

06:29.375 --> 06:31.291
Then technically, yes.

06:31.291 --> 06:33.291
You should know
Diane's gonna try and have

06:33.291 --> 06:35.333
your visitation rights
terminated.

06:35.333 --> 06:38.125
Meaning, what,
I'd never get to
see my kids?

06:38.125 --> 06:39.542
If the judge agrees.

06:39.542 --> 06:40.667
That's bullshit!

06:40.917 --> 06:42.458
We gotta fight this.

my lawyer hat for a minute?

06:44.875 --> 06:46.208

as a friend...

a much better lawyer.

going to change?

Not with you.

off that stage,

I can't...

I like it this way?

07:53.291 --> 07:55.625
You think I don't want
to be with you all the time?
Come on!

What do you want
me to do?
The woman's blind.

Matt LeBlanc!

Matt LeBlanc?

is having an affair
with Matt LeBlanc.

it's true.

for months.

08:25.125 --> 08:27.417

I cannot breathe.

for my sister's funeral.

08:45.875 --> 08:47.375
Pretty.

08:47.375 --> 08:50.250
No, if anything it looks
more like the other cheek
than it did before.

08:50.250 --> 08:51.667
And you really
can't tell?

08:51.667 --> 08:53.125
You really can't.
It's amazing.

08:53.125 --> 08:55.417
Just promise
you're done messing
with your face.

08:55.417 --> 08:58.208
I swear, I'm done
messing with my face.

09:00.208 --> 09:01.542
What?

09:02.583 --> 09:04.625
(SIGHS)
Oh, Christ,
kill me now!

09:04.625 --> 09:08.375
Sean!
Andrew! Where aren't you?

09:08.375 --> 09:10.208
This is my friend,
Morning Randolph.

09:10.208 --> 09:11.250
Hello.
We've met.

09:11.250 --> 09:12.709
So, what brings you here?

09:13.250 --> 09:16.709
I actually just signed
a deal with Merc,

09:16.709 --> 09:18.959
so I thought
I'd better come
and kiss the ring.

09:18.959 --> 09:21.917
You're doing
television now?
I know.

09:21.917 --> 09:23.917
I came up with this
great idea for a show.

09:23.917 --> 09:25.959
It's about this
British couple

09:25.959 --> 09:27.709
who bring their hit
comedy to the States

09:27.709 --> 09:29.542
and how they end up
getting divorced,

09:29.542 --> 09:32.041
but still have to
work together.

09:32.041 --> 09:33.250
You're...

09:33.542 --> 09:35.625
You're fucking
kidding me, right?
I know!

09:35.625 --> 09:37.750
It took me, like,
five seconds
to come up with it.

09:40.250 --> 09:42.667
Oh, look,
there's Bev and Rob.

09:45.458 --> 09:47.333
Oh, God,

09:47.875 --> 09:51.083
it's so hard
seeing her with someone
who's not you.

09:51.917 --> 09:55.250
Just saying
Bev and Rob
feels so wrong.

09:55.583 --> 09:58.083
Bev and Rob.
Bev and Rob.

09:59.709 --> 10:00.917
Excuse me.
Hmm.

10:01.583 --> 10:03.375
Bev!
Rob!

10:05.083 --> 10:09.250
I've been that
cocksucker's friend
for 20 years.

10:09.250 --> 10:10.750
Twenty years.
I know.

10:10.750 --> 10:12.000
He's on my network.

10:12.000 --> 10:14.959
I know.
And when she went blind,
I could have walked out.

10:14.959 --> 10:17.125
But I fucking
stuck by her.

10:17.125 --> 10:18.959
She does not
deserve you.

10:20.375 --> 10:21.709
I guess I'm the blind one.

10:22.375 --> 10:24.208
Oh, and by the way?

10:24.542 --> 10:26.959
I think sometimes
she can actually
see a tiny bit.

10:27.333 --> 10:28.583
No!
I'm telling you.

10:28.583 --> 10:30.417
Like vague
shapes and shadows.

10:30.417 --> 10:32.500
And she calls
herself blind.

10:32.500 --> 10:33.792
What a bitch.

10:33.792 --> 10:35.166
How could she
do this to me?

10:35.625 --> 10:38.458
I'm probably not
the best person to ask.

10:38.458 --> 10:41.000
If you were mine,
believe me...

10:41.375 --> 10:43.667
Well, guess what.
I am yours.

10:44.625 --> 10:46.792
What?
What are you saying?

10:46.792 --> 10:49.375
Oh, yeah.
I am so going to
dump her ass.

10:49.375 --> 10:50.917
What do you
think of that?

10:50.917 --> 10:54.041
I think yeah!
Do it! Dump it!

10:54.041 --> 10:57.458
(CHUCKLES)
Dump it, dump it,
dump it.

11:01.041 --> 11:02.458
(SCOFFS)
Here we go.

11:03.583 --> 11:05.625
Okay,
creepiest smile ever.

11:05.625 --> 11:07.125
Is it too
Wallace and Gromit?

11:07.125 --> 11:08.917
I don't know who
that is, but yeah.

11:08.917 --> 11:11.667
Oh, God, that's his
Wallace and Gromit
smile.

11:11.667 --> 11:13.834
Oh, yeah.
No, that's not
a good thing.

11:40.917 --> 11:42.291
You can do this.

11:43.000 --> 11:44.667
Just knowing
they're both here...

11:44.667 --> 11:45.750
I know.

11:45.750 --> 11:48.709
But you're going to smile
like nothing's wrong

11:48.709 --> 11:51.500
because you are
the Man of the Year.

11:51.500 --> 11:54.375

are paying $10,000 a table

11:54.375 --> 11:55.750

12:09.583 --> 12:11.667
You finally decided to
grace us with your presence.

12:11.667 --> 12:14.208
You know me,
I like to make
an entrance.

12:14.208 --> 12:16.458

Well deserved.

Thank you, my friend.

Can you believe this guy
flew 3,000 miles
just for me?

12:21.333 --> 12:23.375
He's the best.

12:23.375 --> 12:25.083
So, any big plans
while you're out here?

12:25.083 --> 12:27.458
Nope. This weekend's
all about you.

You're gonna make me cry.

12:40.250 --> 12:41.542
Who's that?

12:41.959 --> 12:45.208
Morning's brother, Rob.
He's her date.

12:46.875 --> 12:48.750
What do you mean,
her date?

12:48.750 --> 12:51.709
Well, they're
kind of a thing.

12:56.750 --> 12:58.709
You shitting me?
I shit you not.

13:02.709 --> 13:04.917
And this is okay by you?
Why not?

13:04.917 --> 13:08.917
I told her we had
to move on,
and she believed me.

13:09.667 --> 13:10.917
Why would you do that?

13:10.917 --> 13:13.625
Well, you had a little
something to do with it.

13:13.625 --> 13:16.250
Aw, Christ,
you're still on that?

13:17.000 --> 13:18.792
You fucked my wife.

13:18.792 --> 13:20.333

13:20.333 --> 13:23.166
Right. I can't believe
I'm still dwelling on it.

such an asshole.

13:24.959 --> 13:26.750
You are an asshole.

13:27.542 --> 13:30.333
You love her.
Get over yourself.

13:30.333 --> 13:31.959
It's not that simple.

13:58.875 --> 14:01.792
No. I like a man
who can wear Cinnabon.

14:03.959 --> 14:05.500

14:06.500 --> 14:08.709
Sean and I were
just talking
about assholes.

14:08.709 --> 14:11.792
Oh, so that's what

when we're not around.

14:12.166 --> 14:13.333

14:13.667 --> 14:16.333
I was telling him
to stop being one.

14:17.125 --> 14:19.333
And I realized
the last time
you and I were together,

14:19.333 --> 14:21.792
I kind of was one.

14:22.834 --> 14:24.625
No argument from me.

14:25.542 --> 14:27.959
And then I never
called you,

14:27.959 --> 14:29.667
which makes me
an even bigger one.

the same page.

14:32.667 --> 14:34.208

mess this up.

to keep reminding me.

24:58.208 --> 24:59.458
Where are the bloody
paramedics?

24:59.458 --> 25:02.125
You don't need paramedics.
It's happened before.

25:02.125 --> 25:03.375
Just pop it back in.

25:03.375 --> 25:05.041
What do you mean pop it?
I can't pop it.

25:05.041 --> 25:06.834
You got to!
I can't pop it myself!

25:06.834 --> 25:08.917
I'm not going to pop it!
You need a doctor
to pop it!

25:08.917 --> 25:11.500
No, you don't!
Just grab my arm,

25:11.500 --> 25:13.125
pull it out of the socket,
then pop it back in!

25:13.125 --> 25:14.333
No!
All you got...

25:14.333 --> 25:16.709
Oh, Jesus! Pop it!
I'm beggin' you!

25:18.709 --> 25:20.333
(BOTH SCREAMING)

25:20.333 --> 25:21.959
Just do it, hurry.
I can't!

25:21.959 --> 25:24.083
Just pop it!
Pop it!

25:24.083 --> 25:25.375
ALL: Pop it! Pop it!

25:25.375 --> 25:27.417
Everyone stop saying
pop it!

25:27.417 --> 25:29.166
Do you want me to do it?
Oh, like you could do it!

25:29.166 --> 25:31.041
I could do it!
All right, then do it!

25:32.041 --> 25:33.083
No!
(SCREAMS)

25:33.333 --> 25:34.792
I can't do it!
I'll do it.

25:35.083 --> 25:36.667
No! Not her!

25:37.083 --> 25:38.625
I'll do it.
No!

25:39.917 --> 25:41.542
I can do it.

25:43.750 --> 25:45.500
(GROANING)

25:47.041 --> 25:49.166
(BOTH SCREAMING)

25:50.667 --> 25:51.667
(CRACK)

25:53.875 --> 25:55.375
(SIGHS)

25:57.917 --> 25:59.834
You think you're
gonna be all right?
Just...

26:02.959 --> 26:04.709
Listen to me.

26:04.709 --> 26:08.667
I turned him down.
I didn't take it.

26:10.000 --> 26:11.166
Why?

26:11.709 --> 26:12.917
Why?

26:12.917 --> 26:18.250
Because I would never
do that to you.
I love you.

26:19.208 --> 26:20.458
They're going to
regret this.

26:20.458 --> 26:22.417
You're going to
come back
stronger than ever.

26:22.417 --> 26:24.542
I don't know...
I know.

26:25.125 --> 26:27.583
I'm not saying
it'll be easy.

26:27.583 --> 26:29.458
But we're going to
get through this.

26:29.458 --> 26:30.875
Together.
(SIGHS)

26:31.750 --> 26:33.542
You'll move in with me.

26:33.917 --> 26:36.250
How nice will that be,
to finally...

26:36.250 --> 26:37.875
What?
What are you
talking about?

26:37.875 --> 26:40.041
I can't leave her now.

26:40.041 --> 26:41.458
What?

26:41.458 --> 26:44.083
I've got no fucking job!
You want me to give her
half my money?

26:47.250 --> 26:48.709
(TIRES SCREECH)

26:50.917 --> 26:51.959
Get out.

26:52.667 --> 26:53.792
What?

26:54.041 --> 26:55.709
Get out of my car.

26:57.417 --> 27:00.083
You serious?
No. It's raining.

27:00.083 --> 27:01.875
(SCREAMING) Get out!

27:06.917 --> 27:08.917
Are you fucking crazy?

27:08.917 --> 27:11.583
I don't even know
where the hell I am!

27:12.041 --> 27:13.834
It's downtown.

27:15.041 --> 27:16.750
(SCREAMING)

27:19.125 --> 27:20.792
So, opera...

27:20.792 --> 27:22.750
Apparently it gets
kind of rough.
(CHUCKLES)

27:25.333 --> 27:26.917
You were very
brave tonight.

27:26.917 --> 27:28.458
Please.

27:28.458 --> 27:31.250
Merc Lapidus threw me
around like a sock puppet.

27:31.709 --> 27:34.041
And yet you kept
coming back
for more.

27:34.041 --> 27:35.291
Like an idiot.

27:35.291 --> 27:37.750
I found it heroic.
Hmm.

27:39.166 --> 27:42.000
And then with
the arm popping.

27:43.125 --> 27:47.000
If writing doesn't pan out,
you can always reconsider
being a doctor.

27:47.709 --> 27:49.834
I could specialize
in terrified medicine.
(CHUCKLES)

27:51.083 --> 27:52.709
You'd be brilliant.

27:54.875 --> 27:56.166
Your poor face.

27:57.625 --> 27:59.166
It's seen worse.

28:00.375 --> 28:02.000
When he hit you...

28:03.875 --> 28:05.458
It was like...

28:06.875 --> 28:08.041
I just went...

28:08.041 --> 28:11.792
(SHUSHING)
I'm fine now.
I'm fine. I didn't even...

28:16.166 --> 28:17.250
(WHINING)

28:17.250 --> 28:18.834
Oh, God. I'm sorry.

28:20.834 --> 28:22.000
Please.

28:22.417 --> 28:24.375
Do not be sorry for that.

28:34.208 --> 28:36.166
Should we just leave?

28:36.166 --> 28:38.166
Oh, I'd say so.

28:46.500 --> 28:48.834
I think they're ready
to go here.

28:49.917 --> 28:52.834
You guys coming,
or are you gonna
just make out all night?

28:54.625 --> 28:55.834
We're coming.

29:01.709 --> 29:03.166
Oh, wait.

29:08.166 --> 29:09.417
Seven.

29:09.417 --> 29:10.834
(CHUCKLES)

29:15.834 --> 29:18.458
ANDY:  Listen to this.

29:31.583 --> 29:33.750
