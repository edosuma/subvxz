00:02.029 --> 00:04.532
You are being watched.

00:04.534 --> 00:06.651
The government
has a secret system--

00:06.653 --> 00:10.204
a machine that spies on you
every hour of every day.

00:10.206 --> 00:13.541
I designed the machine
to detect acts of terror,

00:13.543 --> 00:15.376
but it sees everything...

00:15.378 --> 00:18.879
Violent crimes
involving ordinary people.

00:18.881 --> 00:21.215
The government considers
these people irrelevant.

00:21.217 --> 00:23.718
We don't.

00:23.720 --> 00:28.673
Hunted by the authorities,
we work in secret.

00:28.675 --> 00:30.391
You will never find us.

00:30.393 --> 00:32.643
But victim or perpetrator,

00:32.645 --> 00:35.732
if your number's up,
we'll find you.

00:36.438 --> 00:38.437
Sync and corrections by n17t01
www.addic7ed.com

00:44.390 --> 00:46.507
I found that address, Finch.

00:46.509 --> 00:47.942
Who exactly am I looking for?

00:47.944 --> 00:49.310
I don't know how to explain it.

00:49.312 --> 00:50.728
I double-checked,
but it seems

00:50.730 --> 00:53.481
- we have a repeat number.
- A repeat?

00:53.483 --> 00:54.866
Well, who would be dumb enough

00:54.868 --> 00:57.652
to get in a life-threatening
situation again?

01:04.293 --> 01:06.794
Hey, pal.

01:06.796 --> 01:09.414
You won't believe this.

01:09.416 --> 01:11.699
Fellas.

01:11.701 --> 01:15.586
Whatever bodily harm
you want to inflict on this guy,

01:15.588 --> 01:16.871
I'm sure he earned it,

01:16.873 --> 01:19.390
and I have to ask you
to let it slide.

01:19.392 --> 01:21.893
Jeez, Leon, what'd you do
to piss these guys off?

01:21.895 --> 01:23.728
You heard of gold farming?

01:23.730 --> 01:26.647
Selling multiplayer online game
currency for real cash?

01:26.649 --> 01:28.066
It's all the rage.

01:28.068 --> 01:30.017
People make millions.

01:30.019 --> 01:32.904
They take the business
really seriously,

01:32.906 --> 01:34.105
especially the Russian mafia.

01:37.659 --> 01:40.111
Does it look
like I play video games, Leon?

01:40.113 --> 01:42.330
I think I broke my arm.

01:42.332 --> 01:43.614
Ow!

01:46.952 --> 01:48.569
So you brought him here?

01:48.571 --> 01:50.338
You said there was
another number.

01:50.340 --> 01:52.957
I didn't have time
to do anything else with him.

01:57.596 --> 02:00.882
Mr. Tao,
we don't have much time.

02:01.750 --> 02:04.402
What?
Who are you?

02:04.404 --> 02:06.754
The guy who helped me
save your life tonight

02:06.756 --> 02:08.940
for the second time.

02:08.942 --> 02:10.558
Oh.

02:10.560 --> 02:12.059
You're the boss.

02:12.061 --> 02:15.279
Never did figure John here
for upper management.

02:15.281 --> 02:16.898
We have a problem, Leon.

02:16.900 --> 02:18.933
We have to go take care
of another matter,

02:18.935 --> 02:20.568
and the Russians
still want you dead.

02:20.570 --> 02:23.604
So despite my misgivings
about your presence,

02:23.606 --> 02:24.622
you have to stay here.

02:24.624 --> 02:26.791
Where is here?

02:30.496 --> 02:32.580
Food, water.

02:32.582 --> 02:35.166
Latrine's down past
the periodicals.

02:35.168 --> 02:36.951
Don't open any windows.

02:36.953 --> 02:40.454
And don't make any calls.

02:40.456 --> 02:43.641
You expect me to stay here,
and eat Hot Pockets?

02:43.643 --> 02:44.992
Only if you wanna live.

02:44.994 --> 02:46.344
Just don't feed any to bear.

02:46.346 --> 02:47.512
He's on a special diet.

02:50.984 --> 02:52.633
That damn dog again.

02:52.635 --> 02:54.569
You don't suppose any
of my money came out of him?

02:54.571 --> 02:57.471
Oh, and please don't touch
any of my computer equipment.

02:57.473 --> 03:00.775
If you do,
the dog will kill you.

03:01.660 --> 03:03.110
Great.

03:03.112 --> 03:05.246
What am I supposed to do
for entertainment?

03:05.248 --> 03:07.582
It's a library, Mr. Tao.

03:07.584 --> 03:09.033
Try reading a book.

03:09.035 --> 03:11.035
Oh!

03:11.037 --> 03:13.037
Here's a start.

03:15.323 --> 03:19.677
We'll be back soon, Leon.

03:21.297 --> 03:24.265
Tell me, Mr. Reese,
how do you feel about hospitals?

03:24.267 --> 03:26.667
- They've never bothered me.
- I'm glad to hear it.

03:26.669 --> 03:29.270
They make me
aggressively uneasy.

03:31.000 --> 03:37.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:38.231 --> 03:40.681
After the renovations,
you won't even recognize

03:40.683 --> 03:42.984
these old surgical suites
anymore.

03:42.986 --> 03:47.038
Thanks to sizable contributions
from donors such as yourself,

03:47.040 --> 03:49.690
New York General will finally
have a surgical unit

03:49.692 --> 03:52.660
as good as the talented staff
of doctors who utilize it.

03:52.662 --> 03:55.296
Sizable contribution?

03:55.298 --> 03:57.381
I helped pay for a wing...

03:57.383 --> 03:59.166
or two.

03:59.168 --> 04:00.835
How else were we gonna
get close to--

04:00.837 --> 04:02.220
- Dr. Enright.
Perfect timing.

04:02.222 --> 04:06.173
Gentlemen, this is
Dr. Madeleine Enright,

04:06.175 --> 04:09.010
the top cardiothoracic
and trauma surgeon in the state.

04:09.012 --> 04:10.728
She'll be overseeing
the development of the suites.

04:10.730 --> 04:13.264
Madeleine,
this is Harold Crane,

04:13.266 --> 04:14.599
one of our platinum donors,

04:14.601 --> 04:16.483
and his asset manager
Mr. John Rooney.

04:16.486 --> 04:17.551
It's Maddy, please.

04:17.553 --> 04:19.053
Maddy is the kind of doctor

04:19.055 --> 04:20.938
that makes the staff here
truly stand out.

04:20.940 --> 04:23.524
The kind of doctor who
wouldn't find her glasses

04:23.526 --> 04:26.244
if they were surgically attached
to her face.

04:26.246 --> 04:27.878
Would those be yours there?

04:27.880 --> 04:29.447
Oh.

04:29.449 --> 04:31.032
Like I said.

04:31.034 --> 04:32.867
I'm sorry,
I have a patient waiting.

04:32.869 --> 04:34.418
I must be going.

04:34.420 --> 04:35.586
Nicely done, Finch.

04:35.588 --> 04:37.338
- Her eyes, our ears.
- Hmm.

04:37.340 --> 04:40.541
Gentlemen, unfortunately,
we must be going as well.

04:40.543 --> 04:41.909
We're closing off this section
of the floor

04:41.911 --> 04:45.630
for a very sensitive surgery.

04:47.082 --> 04:49.717
Is that a normal precaution?

04:49.719 --> 04:53.271
Let me just say it's strictly
for the safety of the patient.

04:55.390 --> 04:58.693
This room is nearly identical
to the OR.

04:58.695 --> 05:00.945
That your procedure
will take place in.

05:00.947 --> 05:03.064
It's a routine coronary bypass,

05:03.066 --> 05:05.149
off-pump,
"beating heart" surgery.

05:05.151 --> 05:06.617
It lasts four, five hours,

05:06.619 --> 05:08.769
and you'll be in the room
the whole time.

05:08.771 --> 05:11.605
Now we don't have all
the best toys yet,

05:11.607 --> 05:13.708
but with our coronary
catheterization process,

05:13.710 --> 05:15.626
and our 3D angiography
C-arm system--

05:15.628 --> 05:17.277
It's fully endoscopic?

05:17.279 --> 05:20.414
You've studied
your procedures, mister--

05:20.416 --> 05:22.616
Rains.
Yes, I've studied.

05:22.618 --> 05:24.085
Can't be too safe,

05:24.087 --> 05:26.003
not when Mr. Veldt
has an energy empire to run.

05:26.005 --> 05:27.138
Four to five hours?

05:27.140 --> 05:28.673
You can't do better than that?

05:28.675 --> 05:32.226
Mr. Veldt, regardless
of how big your company is,

05:32.228 --> 05:34.628
this surgery
is critical for you.

05:34.630 --> 05:36.180
It takes time.

05:36.182 --> 05:38.149
As long as it remains private

05:38.151 --> 05:40.151
from shareholders
and the public.

05:40.153 --> 05:41.635
Per the multiple
nondisclosure agreements

05:41.637 --> 05:42.820
you've signed.

05:42.822 --> 05:45.773
Yeah, and despite
my objections,

05:45.775 --> 05:48.526
your procedure has been listed
as minor outpatient surgery.

05:48.528 --> 05:51.579
My team has been reduced
to essential personnel,

05:51.581 --> 05:53.531
and the floor
is being cleared now.

05:53.533 --> 05:55.482
My team will make sure of that.

05:55.484 --> 05:57.151
Of course.

05:57.153 --> 05:59.820
Yeah, your security seems
to have made themselves at home.

05:59.822 --> 06:02.340
Trauma!

06:02.342 --> 06:05.159
Albanian gang member
shot in a territorial dispute.

06:05.161 --> 06:07.862
Penetrating trauma,
fresh from emergency.

06:07.864 --> 06:10.848
- Ballistic?
- Single GSW, upper torso.

06:10.850 --> 06:12.666
Paramedics had trouble
with the BP.

06:12.668 --> 06:15.335
Systolic was 70,
but diastolic was impalpable.

06:15.337 --> 06:18.689
He's got a gun.

06:18.691 --> 06:20.307
Everybody shut up!

06:21.843 --> 06:23.027
You wanna be a tough guy,
or you want me

06:23.029 --> 06:25.896
to save your friend's life?

06:29.017 --> 06:31.736
Nurse, this man
is in hypovolemic shock,

06:31.738 --> 06:33.037
and I think a collapsed lung

06:33.039 --> 06:34.538
is what's giving
those O2 readings.

06:34.540 --> 06:35.823
Okay, we're moving.

06:35.825 --> 06:37.992
Prep surgery,
and a thoracotomy tray.

06:37.994 --> 06:40.578
Get me a restraint
before he swallows his tongue.

06:40.580 --> 06:42.713
She certainly
seems unflappable.

06:42.715 --> 06:44.031
I'd say.

06:44.033 --> 06:46.000
You sure she was never
a combat medic?

06:46.002 --> 06:48.386
I'm not so sure
she isn't one now.

06:48.388 --> 06:49.587
So what's the threat

06:49.589 --> 06:52.339
besides gun-toting gangs
in surgery?

06:52.341 --> 06:53.924
It could come
from anywhere else.

06:53.926 --> 06:55.893
A malpractice in her past,

06:55.895 --> 06:57.895
a bereaved relative
of a patient she lost,

06:57.897 --> 07:01.265
or as always,
someone in her personal life.

07:09.524 --> 07:11.492
Oh.

07:11.494 --> 07:14.495
I brought you an espresso
and a <i>pain au chocolat</i>

07:14.497 --> 07:16.897
from the French place
on Columbus that you like.

07:16.899 --> 07:19.233
Oh... you know I shouldn't.

07:19.235 --> 07:21.952
Except on days when you're
closing up gunshot wounds.

07:21.954 --> 07:24.839
Ugh-- you must've been in a cab
half the morning to get this.

07:24.841 --> 07:27.041
Your text said "emergency."

07:27.043 --> 07:28.843
I take emergencies
very seriously.

07:28.845 --> 07:30.811
Maddy seems safe, Finch.

07:30.813 --> 07:31.912
Her wife's name is Amy.

07:31.914 --> 07:33.764
I found her bio on the website

07:33.766 --> 07:35.800
of the children's charity
where she's executive director.

07:35.802 --> 07:37.935
They've been married
since last June.

07:37.937 --> 07:40.254
So when does that Veldt guy
go into surgery?

07:40.256 --> 07:42.223
I, uh-- half hour.
Ugh.

07:42.225 --> 07:45.759
God, I am already exhausted,
and I still have that.

07:45.761 --> 07:48.095
I have that art fundraiser
th the park today,

07:48.097 --> 07:50.731
but I'm gonna
check in on you, okay?

07:50.733 --> 07:52.766
And try to give that jerk
a bigger heart,

07:52.768 --> 07:54.401
while you're at it.

07:54.403 --> 07:57.655
Well, I can't fix
everything that's broken.

08:09.018 --> 08:11.802
Two shots, close range?

08:11.804 --> 08:15.339
That overkill when you shoot
a guy in the back?

08:18.059 --> 08:19.810
Even got his pocket lint.

08:36.328 --> 08:38.279
- Carter.
- Hey, it's me.

08:38.280 --> 08:39.830
Someone dropped a body
in Long Island City,

08:39.832 --> 08:41.015
execution-style.

08:41.017 --> 08:43.116
I think you wanna come
take a look.

08:43.119 --> 08:46.787
- You can't handle it?
- Trust me, you wanna be here.

08:46.789 --> 08:48.923
It's got your name
all over it--

08:48.925 --> 08:52.426
literally.

09:00.135 --> 09:02.303
I'm sorry--
you can't be in here.

09:02.305 --> 09:05.039
But I'm rather enjoying
the view.

09:05.041 --> 09:06.941
Are you looking for someone?

09:06.943 --> 09:08.142
Yes.

09:08.144 --> 09:10.177
For you.

09:10.179 --> 09:11.395
Did you know that according

09:11.397 --> 09:13.397
to the American Medical
Association,

09:13.399 --> 09:17.651
98,000 people a year
die from medical error?

09:17.653 --> 09:19.320
I don't know
who you are, but--

09:19.322 --> 09:21.572
My name, while inconsequential,

09:21.574 --> 09:23.157
is Alistair Wesley.

09:23.159 --> 09:26.026
Today, a mistake will be
your best friend.

09:26.028 --> 09:29.029
Let's you and I discuss
Oliver Veldt.

09:29.031 --> 09:31.549
Now...

09:33.868 --> 09:35.702
are you watching carefully?

09:35.704 --> 09:37.555
Your lovely wife Amy.

09:37.557 --> 09:40.007
The infrared laser belongs
to a marksman,

09:40.009 --> 09:42.309
and unless you wish
to see his skill,

09:42.311 --> 09:44.395
you will listen.

09:44.397 --> 09:47.214
Oliver Veldt
will not survive his surgery.

09:47.216 --> 09:50.351
Tomorrow, the papers will note
that despite the heroic efforts

09:50.353 --> 09:52.052
of his talented surgeon,

09:52.054 --> 09:54.888
at approximately 1:15,
he expired

09:54.890 --> 09:56.740
from a massive
internal hemorrhage.

09:56.742 --> 09:58.725
You're crazy.
How would I--

09:58.727 --> 10:00.661
- how could I do that?
- Very easily.

10:00.663 --> 10:02.229
Wait, Mr. Reese.
Something's happening.

10:02.231 --> 10:04.248
You must follow
my instructions to the letter.

10:04.250 --> 10:07.668
- Someone is with Maddy.
- Exactly one hour into surgery,

10:07.670 --> 10:11.571
you will introduce 100ccs
of the anticoagulant heparin

10:11.573 --> 10:14.508
into his system--
instant hemophilia.

10:14.510 --> 10:16.176
30 minutes after that,

10:16.178 --> 10:19.880
you will nick his left
anterior descending artery.

10:19.882 --> 10:21.966
He will bleed out
on the operating table.

10:21.968 --> 10:24.251
No-- I can't.
I won't.

10:24.253 --> 10:28.055
If surgery is stopped
for any reason, Amy dies.

10:28.057 --> 10:31.642
If she is warned in any way,
she dies.

10:31.644 --> 10:34.528
If the police are called
to the park or to the hospital,

10:34.530 --> 10:36.030
she dies.

10:36.032 --> 10:40.117
Do you understand these rules?

10:40.119 --> 10:41.485
Excellent.

10:41.487 --> 10:44.538
It would be wise not to test me
in any way.

10:44.540 --> 10:46.740
Talk soon.

10:49.544 --> 10:52.212
So Maddy's not the victim
after all, Mr. Reese.

10:52.214 --> 10:54.248
No, Finch.

10:54.250 --> 10:57.051
They're gonna force her
to be the perpetrator.

11:07.685 --> 11:09.018
That's the threat, Finch.

11:09.020 --> 11:11.020
They're going
to kill Oliver Veldt.

11:11.022 --> 11:13.056
On the contrary, they're gonna
have maddy do it for them.

11:13.058 --> 11:14.691
Well, we need to get to her.

11:14.693 --> 11:17.026
We'll never get past
veldt's security.

11:17.028 --> 11:18.928
Besides, as long
as his guards are around,

11:18.930 --> 11:20.396
she should be safe in surgery.

11:20.398 --> 11:22.181
It's her wife
that I'm worried about.

11:22.183 --> 11:23.983
It might be good to have
someone near the doctor.

11:23.985 --> 11:25.652
I'll stay here.

11:25.654 --> 11:28.454
I'll handle the park
and assess the threat on Amy.

11:28.456 --> 11:31.691
Eh, Finch?
Are you gonna be okay here?

11:31.693 --> 11:34.694
Even if I had a phobia,
Mr. Reese,

11:34.696 --> 11:37.797
now would not be the time
for it.

11:40.969 --> 11:42.969
Ooh... ugh...

11:42.971 --> 11:44.170
Who's the vic?

11:44.172 --> 11:45.972
Guy by the name of Dusan Babic.

11:45.974 --> 11:49.142
40, no family, recently
immigrated from Croatia,

11:49.144 --> 11:51.144
worked for Greater New York
Custodial Services.

11:51.146 --> 11:54.981
- Straight-up robbery?
- That's what I thought...

11:54.983 --> 11:57.266
till I found this on him.

12:01.322 --> 12:03.439
I didn't feel the need
to share with others.

12:03.441 --> 12:06.776
Check the back.

12:09.246 --> 12:10.330
What does that mean?

12:10.332 --> 12:13.032
I thought you could tell me.

12:13.034 --> 12:14.751
Well, you might wanna
get out of here

12:14.753 --> 12:18.254
before people start asking
questions you can't answer.

12:18.256 --> 12:20.790
Thanks.

12:25.629 --> 12:27.380
Fentanyl administered, doctor.

12:27.382 --> 12:30.350
Mr. Veldt, if I could ask you
to sign one last consent form.

12:30.352 --> 12:32.435
How many forms
will it take for me

12:32.437 --> 12:33.753
to sign my life away?

12:33.755 --> 12:36.139
Liz is just doing her job,
Mr. Veldt.

12:36.141 --> 12:38.141
Any surgery has its risks.

12:38.143 --> 12:41.444
And I chose the top surgeon
in the state to eliminate them.

12:41.446 --> 12:43.946
You'd do best to remember that.

12:52.289 --> 12:54.040
Doctor?

12:54.042 --> 12:55.958
Once the procedure begins,
are you planning on using

12:55.960 --> 12:57.877
the saphenous vein
for the bypassing channel?

12:57.879 --> 13:00.630
No, I'll use the internal
mammary artery for grafts,

13:00.632 --> 13:02.465
which anyone with an MD
will tell you

13:02.467 --> 13:04.450
shows the best
long-term results.

13:04.452 --> 13:08.287
But thank you for your
unnecessary concern, Mr. Rains.

13:13.981 --> 13:17.950
_

14:01.191 --> 14:02.842
I'm in Maddy's office,
Mr. Reese.

14:02.844 --> 14:05.177
With her computer,
perhaps I can discover

14:05.179 --> 14:07.280
the connection between Veldt
and Wesley.

14:07.282 --> 14:09.866
I'm at the park now, Finch.

14:09.868 --> 14:13.319
Got eyes on Amy, and she
couldn't be more exposed.

14:15.539 --> 14:18.357
Lots of bystanders
around here too.

14:18.359 --> 14:21.461
According to Wesley's rules,
if we alert the police,

14:21.463 --> 14:22.628
she's dead.

14:22.630 --> 14:24.497
Then we find the sniper.

14:24.499 --> 14:26.716
We know anything more
about Alistair Wesley?

14:26.718 --> 14:28.384
Besides his name
and that accent?

14:28.386 --> 14:29.969
I can't find out anymore
while I'm stuck here

14:29.971 --> 14:31.337
in the surgical wing.

14:31.339 --> 14:33.306
Then we'll work
with what we got.

14:33.308 --> 14:36.125
I was able to decode
the live video

14:36.127 --> 14:38.561
of Amy in the park
that Wesley sent,

14:38.563 --> 14:41.397
so as long as Maddy is streaming
it here in the hospital,

14:41.399 --> 14:43.149
we'll be able to see it too.

14:43.151 --> 14:44.984
Sending you an image.

14:48.089 --> 14:51.824
Can you use it to triangulate
the sniper's position?

14:51.826 --> 14:53.225
It wouldn't be the first time.

14:53.227 --> 14:54.994
From Maddy's personal file,

14:54.996 --> 14:59.782
it seems that Oliver Veldt's
blood type is O-negative.

14:59.784 --> 15:02.201
If I can hack
the hospital's inventory

15:02.203 --> 15:04.136
and register a shortage
of O-negative blood,

15:04.138 --> 15:05.454
I could stall the surgery

15:05.456 --> 15:08.708
without breaking
any of Wesley's rules.

15:10.544 --> 15:14.680
Finch, I pinpointed
the sniper's location.

15:16.082 --> 15:20.102
Based on that laser, our sniper
has a northeast position

15:20.104 --> 15:23.556
at least eight floors up.

16:04.848 --> 16:07.650
Type III ballistic body armor.

16:07.652 --> 16:11.437
Don't worry.
Those ribs'll heal.

16:11.439 --> 16:13.906
No ID, Finch.

16:13.908 --> 16:15.358
Super glue on his finger tips.

16:15.360 --> 16:16.692
Classic black ops trick.

16:22.199 --> 16:25.484
Hello, Mr. Mystery guest.

16:25.486 --> 16:28.671
Wesley, is it--
Alistair Wesley?

16:28.673 --> 16:29.872
I don't know who you are

16:29.874 --> 16:31.657
or what you just did
to my associate,

16:31.659 --> 16:33.626
but I'd like
to buy you a drink,

16:33.628 --> 16:35.628
or Amy dies immediately.

16:35.630 --> 16:39.515
That's a kind offer,
but your sniper's toast.

16:39.517 --> 16:40.967
I'll call your bluff.

16:40.969 --> 16:42.685
You're assuming he was alone.

16:42.687 --> 16:44.553
All units check in.

16:44.555 --> 16:46.889
Red one. Check.

16:46.891 --> 16:48.340
Red two. Check.

16:48.342 --> 16:50.026
And so on and so forth.

16:50.028 --> 16:52.678
There's a pub at the corner
of the park.

16:52.680 --> 16:54.179
I'll be seeing you.

16:55.349 --> 16:58.350
Mr. Reese,
what will you do?

16:58.352 --> 17:01.237
Guess I'll go have that drink.

17:13.109 --> 17:15.662
Okay, Mr. Babic,
who wanted you dead,

17:15.664 --> 17:18.848
and what are they trying
to tell me?

17:18.849 --> 17:20.950
Lived alone,

17:20.952 --> 17:25.454
never missed a day of work
at Greater New York Custodial.

17:25.457 --> 17:28.174
Serviced business
across the city--

17:28.175 --> 17:29.926
mostly tech companies,

17:29.928 --> 17:32.762
including Fujima Techtronics,

17:32.764 --> 17:38.718
located at 66 11th Avenue,
New York.

17:57.872 --> 18:01.925
I didn't figure you for
a day-in-the-park kind of guy.

18:01.927 --> 18:04.077
Anyone can appreciate nature,
Lionel.

18:04.079 --> 18:06.062
So what's up?

18:06.064 --> 18:07.380
See that art fair over there?

18:07.382 --> 18:08.798
There's a nice young lady
running it.

18:08.800 --> 18:10.200
Her name's Amy.

18:10.202 --> 18:12.702
I need you to keep an eye on her
for a minute.

18:12.704 --> 18:14.504
What-- she in some kind
of trouble?

18:14.506 --> 18:18.141
Let's just say she found
herself in a few crosshairs.

18:18.143 --> 18:19.943
Wait, where you going?

18:19.945 --> 18:22.145
- To have a drink.
- Wait, what?

18:22.147 --> 18:24.213
This is a professional team,
Finch.

18:24.215 --> 18:25.732
If they were brought on
to execute this plan,

18:25.734 --> 18:27.383
someone is paying them.

18:27.385 --> 18:29.869
Unfortunately, I'm unable
to play detective today,

18:29.871 --> 18:32.155
but I know somebody perfect.

18:33.357 --> 18:34.890
I-I know
who Oliver veldt is--

18:34.892 --> 18:36.276
energy guy, right?

18:36.278 --> 18:38.027
"Energy" in the sense
that he supplies power

18:38.029 --> 18:39.913
to half the Eastern seaboard,
yes.

18:39.915 --> 18:41.581
Someone wants
to flatline him, huh?

18:41.583 --> 18:43.399
We have a job
that's a perfect fit

18:43.401 --> 18:45.585
for a former
forensic accountant.

18:45.587 --> 18:47.670
Think of it
as a digital treasure hunt.

18:47.672 --> 18:50.757
Find out who would target Veldt
in the corporate world,

18:50.759 --> 18:52.542
follow the money trail
to the hit team,

18:52.544 --> 18:55.378
and help us stop the plot
at its source.

18:55.380 --> 18:56.596
How am I supposed to do that?

18:56.598 --> 18:58.264
Go over to my computer station.

18:58.266 --> 19:01.517
I'm not supposed to touch
the computer, remember?

19:01.519 --> 19:05.605
And your special diet man-eater

19:05.607 --> 19:10.092
won't let me go anywhere
near the keyboard.

19:10.094 --> 19:12.278
Put me on speakerphone.

19:19.620 --> 19:21.487
Bear?

19:21.489 --> 19:24.157
<i>Ontspan.</i>

19:24.159 --> 19:26.242
Ont-- ontspan?

19:27.495 --> 19:29.379
Multilingual mutt--
dig it.

19:29.381 --> 19:32.465
Start by composing a list
of Veldt's enemies.

19:32.467 --> 19:35.385
Who stands to benefit most
from Veldt's death?

19:35.387 --> 19:37.420
Did another company plot it?

19:37.422 --> 19:40.089
Gives new meaning to the
phrase "hostile takeover," huh?

19:40.091 --> 19:44.010
I'm extending an element
of trust to you, Mr. Tao.

19:44.012 --> 19:48.314
Please resist the temptation
to test the limits of my system.

19:48.316 --> 19:50.850
Do I seem like the kind of guy
who would let you down?

20:04.715 --> 20:10.036
Do you know why a good barman
favors larger ice cubes?

20:10.038 --> 20:11.454
They melt slower.

20:11.456 --> 20:14.123
And they don't dilute
the whiskey,

20:14.125 --> 20:17.627
the way a tight plan
doesn't obscure its objectives.

20:19.831 --> 20:21.881
Is that to protect you from me?

20:21.883 --> 20:25.167
No, but it might help
against your sentry at the door.

20:25.169 --> 20:27.687
The silencer poking out
of his crossword section

20:27.689 --> 20:29.188
was a pretty good giveaway.

20:33.027 --> 20:35.778
I have my own cameras
positioned all over,

20:35.780 --> 20:38.865
and a troop of operatives
running recce on the wife.

20:38.867 --> 20:40.850
There's always someone
close enough to kill her

20:40.852 --> 20:42.518
at a moment's notice,

20:42.520 --> 20:45.705
so put away the gun
and have a drink.

20:50.711 --> 20:53.613
I'd say you were
a former MI-6,

20:53.615 --> 20:57.300
and your team-- all ex-SAS.

20:57.302 --> 20:59.052
You're good on your feet,

20:59.054 --> 21:01.821
and you know your way
around an asset.

21:01.823 --> 21:04.140
Ex-CIA?

21:06.427 --> 21:08.444
Smashing.

21:08.446 --> 21:09.896
How much do you cost?

21:09.898 --> 21:12.849
- Not for sale.
- You're working for Veldt?

21:12.851 --> 21:16.269
Some kind
of additional security?

21:16.271 --> 21:18.738
It doesn't matter.

21:18.740 --> 21:21.824
What matters is--
if you were caught,

21:21.826 --> 21:23.659
why didn't I kill the wife?

21:23.661 --> 21:27.447
Because the doctor hasn't
broken any of your rules yet.

21:27.449 --> 21:31.584
Exactly, but my sense
of propriety has its limits.

21:31.586 --> 21:34.337
Now stay out of the park
and away from the wife.

21:34.339 --> 21:38.324
This isn't your game, and no
one's invited you to play.

21:38.326 --> 21:40.126
Don't test me.

21:40.128 --> 21:41.794
I was expecting everything.

21:41.796 --> 21:44.013
You weren't expecting me.

22:16.964 --> 22:19.215
We'll be ready for you
soon, doctor.

22:27.341 --> 22:30.347
_

22:36.132 --> 22:38.184
Dr. Enright,
I hate to bother you.

22:38.186 --> 22:39.802
What are you doing in here?

22:39.804 --> 22:43.806
Do you remember me?
From earlier today?

22:43.808 --> 22:45.608
You're that donor-- Crane.

22:45.610 --> 22:49.328
Look, you may not believe
this, but I know your wife, Amy,

22:49.330 --> 22:51.447
and I know the predicament
that you're in.

22:51.449 --> 22:53.583
I have an associate
who's working now

22:53.585 --> 22:57.537
to ensure her safety,
but you have to trust us.

22:57.539 --> 22:59.038
Who are you?

22:59.040 --> 23:00.823
How do I know
you're not working for that man?

23:00.825 --> 23:03.910
This procedure was supposed
to start 20 minutes ago,

23:03.912 --> 23:05.928
but I altered
the hospital blood records

23:05.930 --> 23:08.163
to delay the surgery.

23:08.165 --> 23:11.333
In a moment, a nurse will come
in here to explain the error.

23:11.335 --> 23:12.768
Now listen to me carefully.

23:12.770 --> 23:14.637
We can't make Wesley suspicious,

23:14.639 --> 23:17.890
but we'll save Amy before you
have to make the incision.

23:20.027 --> 23:21.978
Doctor, I checked
the O-neg records downstairs.

23:21.980 --> 23:24.447
It's a computer mix-up.
They're fixing the glitch.

23:24.449 --> 23:25.815
We have plenty
of blood reserves.

23:25.817 --> 23:28.618
We should be ready
to go shortly.

23:28.620 --> 23:33.188
Liz,
this is Dr. Crane.

23:33.190 --> 23:36.909
I brought him in as a second
scrub if I need help.

23:36.911 --> 23:39.128
Whatever you say, doctor.

23:41.882 --> 23:43.382
Help me.

23:43.384 --> 23:46.002
Help us, Amy and I,

23:46.004 --> 23:48.838
or I don't know what I'll do.

23:57.898 --> 24:00.049
Maddy has officially gone into
the operating room, Mr. Reese.

24:00.051 --> 24:01.517
How are things in the park?

24:01.519 --> 24:03.870
My drink with Wesley
didn't go so well,

24:03.872 --> 24:07.773
but we can count another one
of his operatives out.

24:07.775 --> 24:09.742
He brought his own cameras

24:09.744 --> 24:12.227
and has every inch
of this park monitored.

24:12.229 --> 24:14.897
It seems that he too
knows the value of surveillance.

24:14.899 --> 24:18.801
What's worse--
if he chose his people well,

24:18.803 --> 24:21.871
we'll never pick his sleepers
out of a crowd this big.

24:25.259 --> 24:28.711
Ports and trocar is inserted.

24:28.713 --> 24:31.931
I'll start the harvest
of the mammary artery.

24:31.933 --> 24:36.218
Is everything
all right, doctor?

24:36.220 --> 24:37.937
Readjust the camera
a millimeter

24:37.939 --> 24:39.855
along the main coronary,
please.

24:39.857 --> 24:41.641
How is that, doctor?

24:41.643 --> 24:44.694
Increasing irrigation.

24:44.696 --> 24:46.112
Applying more suction.

24:48.065 --> 24:51.117
She's injecting the
anticoagulant into Veldt's IV.

24:58.292 --> 25:00.493
Mr. Reese,
we're running out of time.

25:15.321 --> 25:18.106
Mr. Reese, Maddy's holding it
together somehow,

25:18.108 --> 25:20.742
but after that injection
of heparin, Veldt's a time bomb.

25:20.744 --> 25:21.943
Any wrong incision
at this point--

25:23.113 --> 25:25.913
Hold on.

25:25.915 --> 25:27.498
Mr. Tao, what did you find?

25:27.500 --> 25:29.250
Finch! Bubby--

25:29.252 --> 25:31.285
I hacked
into the Veldt Corp. servers

25:31.287 --> 25:33.004
using a back door
in their website

25:33.006 --> 25:35.956
and found a proposed
multimillion-dollar project

25:35.958 --> 25:37.458
for offshore wind farms.

25:37.460 --> 25:40.094
Veldt dismissed it.

25:40.096 --> 25:42.797
An "unsustainable pipe dream,"
he called it.

25:42.799 --> 25:44.766
- That's an actual quote--
- Leon.

25:44.768 --> 25:47.185
I called an old drinking buddy
at the SEC.

25:47.187 --> 25:49.103
Who sent me blue sheets,

25:49.105 --> 25:52.240
monthly reports
tracking stock activity.

25:52.242 --> 25:54.692
I found a series of short sales
for Veldt stock.

25:54.694 --> 25:56.744
It's trading
at an all-time high,

25:56.746 --> 25:59.447
so someone's betting
that the company fails big.

25:59.449 --> 26:01.916
That investor will make
a fortune if the stock drops.

26:01.918 --> 26:04.335
For instance, if the CEO
underwent a secret surgery

26:04.337 --> 26:05.503
and died on the table.

26:05.505 --> 26:07.755
Yahtzee.

26:07.757 --> 26:09.457
It must be Wesley
and his associates.

26:09.459 --> 26:11.292
They're financing
their own operation.

26:11.294 --> 26:15.263
I found an active server at
the ISP for those short sales.

26:15.265 --> 26:18.165
Could be an interesting
arbitrage opportunity here.

26:18.167 --> 26:19.550
I'll keep digging.

26:19.552 --> 26:21.762
Let me know the minute
you find something.

26:27.727 --> 26:30.010
Hello, doctor.

26:33.732 --> 26:37.285
Still trying
to secure your wife.

26:37.287 --> 26:39.453
Everyone, I'm going to need
to take a short break

26:39.455 --> 26:40.655
for a few minutes.

26:40.657 --> 26:41.823
Are you all right, doctor?

26:41.825 --> 26:43.207
Do we need
to get someone in here

26:43.209 --> 26:44.575
to assist with the surgery?

26:44.577 --> 26:46.661
No, that won't be
necessary, Liz.

26:46.663 --> 26:48.329
Please monitor
the patient's vitals,

26:48.331 --> 26:50.431
and I'll be right back.

26:54.670 --> 26:56.304
Is there nothing more
we can do?

26:56.306 --> 26:58.139
I promise you--
my associate is close

26:58.141 --> 27:00.842
to getting Amy out of danger.

27:02.929 --> 27:06.180
Yeah, I just--
I need a minute.

27:22.898 --> 27:24.582
Why did you stop, doctor?

27:24.584 --> 27:27.401
I don't think you understand
how serious this is.

27:27.403 --> 27:29.036
How about a little motivation?

27:29.038 --> 27:31.422
I'm going to connect you
to your wife now.

27:31.424 --> 27:33.891
You have 30 seconds,
but do remember the rules

27:33.893 --> 27:36.978
and how much you have to lose.

27:36.980 --> 27:38.045
Ooh, sorry.

27:38.047 --> 27:39.847
I have to take this.

27:39.849 --> 27:42.216
Hi, babe!
I thought you were in surgery.

27:42.218 --> 27:44.352
Still going.

27:44.354 --> 27:46.971
I just, uh, took a break
to catch my breath.

27:46.973 --> 27:49.056
Uh, it's nothing compared
to yours,

27:49.058 --> 27:50.524
but it's been nuts here.

27:50.526 --> 27:52.393
The caterers didn't show
for the donor picnic,

27:52.395 --> 27:53.945
and I had to scramble.

27:53.947 --> 27:57.365
I'm sorry, Ames--
um, I only have a minute.

27:57.367 --> 28:00.818
The timetable is... killer.

28:00.820 --> 28:03.204
I just wanted
to hear your voice.

28:03.206 --> 28:05.773
Is everything all right?

28:05.775 --> 28:08.042
Totally fine.

28:08.044 --> 28:09.210
I love you.

28:09.212 --> 28:10.745
I love you, too.

28:10.747 --> 28:12.997
Hang in there.

28:15.618 --> 28:17.117
Wesley knew the surgery
was interrupted

28:17.119 --> 28:18.819
in less than a minute.

28:18.821 --> 28:21.555
He must have eyes and ears
in that hospital somewhere.

28:21.557 --> 28:22.957
We don't have a choice, Finch.

28:22.959 --> 28:24.926
I'm getting Amy out.

28:34.353 --> 28:36.938
Everybody has to stay
in the plaza

28:36.940 --> 28:39.140
until we work this out.

28:39.142 --> 28:40.641
Excuse me.

28:40.643 --> 28:42.076
Detective Carter, Homicide.

28:42.078 --> 28:43.661
Homicide?
You got here pretty fast.

28:43.663 --> 28:45.479
We just called in shots fired
a few minutes ago.

28:45.481 --> 28:47.665
Uh, I don't know
if there are a bodies yet.

28:47.667 --> 28:49.149
There was shots fired inside?

28:49.151 --> 28:50.818
Some kind of botched robbery.

28:50.820 --> 28:52.370
What is this place?

28:52.372 --> 28:54.705
Fujima Techtronics
research facility.

28:54.707 --> 28:57.375
Alarms went off on the clean
room floor, where they do R&D.

28:57.377 --> 28:59.460
Guy got inside,
had his exit blocked,

28:59.462 --> 29:02.363
shots fired, guards down,
ambulance is on its way.

29:02.365 --> 29:05.850
We're clearing the building
as we speak.

29:05.852 --> 29:07.468
Excuse me.

29:07.470 --> 29:09.804
What's the status
on those floor evacuations?

29:14.443 --> 29:17.278
So what are you thinking?

29:17.280 --> 29:19.380
Diversion, then extraction.

29:21.416 --> 29:24.485
So if you're the extraction,
I'm the diversion?

29:24.487 --> 29:26.687
What do you need me to do?

29:29.791 --> 29:32.960
Hey, buddy-- I'm working
an abduction in the area.

29:32.962 --> 29:34.161
You see anything suspicious?

29:34.163 --> 29:35.629
Sorry, Detective, I haven't,

29:35.631 --> 29:37.081
and I've been on the beat
all morning.

29:37.083 --> 29:39.333
Hey-- I didn't excuse you, Officer.

29:39.335 --> 29:41.602
- What?
- What are you, a probie?

29:41.604 --> 29:43.370
Have a little respect
when I talk.

29:43.372 --> 29:45.639
I'm sorry, sir.
I haven't seen anything.

29:45.641 --> 29:47.758
- Wish I could help.
- Yeah.

29:47.760 --> 29:49.927
I want your name, your badge,

29:49.929 --> 29:52.730
your social security number.
Where are you from?

29:52.732 --> 29:54.598
- What precinct are you from?
- Hey, settle down, okay?

29:54.600 --> 29:58.436
I don't know why you're breaking
my balls, Detective.

29:58.438 --> 29:59.887
You represent the NYPD?
I want some ID right now.

30:01.491 --> 30:03.991
- Finch.
- Mr. Tao?

30:03.993 --> 30:05.526
Ah-- that was fast.

30:05.528 --> 30:07.912
Me and Bear--
we're a hell of a team.

30:07.914 --> 30:10.581
Even with one arm, I'm still
the fastest gun in the west.

30:10.583 --> 30:11.866
Yes, yes, back pats all around.

30:11.868 --> 30:14.702
What'd you find out?

30:14.704 --> 30:18.589
Well, I was snooping around
the short seller server.

30:18.591 --> 30:20.124
That thing was a gold mine--

30:20.126 --> 30:23.044
private medical forms
signed by Oliver Veldt

30:23.046 --> 30:25.596
buried in a trash file.
Would you believe that?

30:25.598 --> 30:27.214
This is fun.

30:27.216 --> 30:29.050
This is what you and John
do all day long?

30:29.052 --> 30:32.419
Someone on the inside
must've told Wesley

30:32.421 --> 30:33.687
about the surgery.

30:33.689 --> 30:35.439
Who would've known in advance?

30:35.441 --> 30:37.525
This whole thing was supposed
to be a big secret, right?

30:37.527 --> 30:40.778
Someone in Veldt's company
with knowledge of the surgery,

30:40.780 --> 30:43.764
familiar with its intricacies--

30:43.766 --> 30:45.616
Mr. Tao,
how quickly can you send me

30:45.618 --> 30:47.034
everything you've dug up?

30:50.123 --> 30:52.272
Oh...

30:54.710 --> 30:57.378
I'm sorry,
this isn't my phone--

30:57.380 --> 30:59.113
- Amy, we don't have
a lot of time,

30:59.115 --> 31:00.581
so I need you to listen.

31:00.583 --> 31:03.050
I know your wife, Maddy.
She's a great surgeon.

31:03.052 --> 31:05.469
I know you two love each other,
and I know you love pastries

31:05.471 --> 31:07.171
from a French bakery
on the West Side.

31:07.173 --> 31:10.391
Personally, I think they use
too much butter.

31:10.393 --> 31:12.927
What?
What's going on?

31:12.929 --> 31:14.562
You and Maddy are in a lot
of danger right now,

31:14.564 --> 31:16.097
but I'm here to help you.

31:16.099 --> 31:18.015
I don't know
what you're talking about.

31:18.017 --> 31:19.567
There are cameras watching you.

31:19.569 --> 31:21.235
I can direct you out
of the park,

31:21.237 --> 31:23.604
and keep you off the radar
from a lot of bad people,

31:23.606 --> 31:25.906
but you need to stay
on that phone,

31:25.908 --> 31:28.976
and listen to me
very carefully.

31:28.978 --> 31:30.244
One wrong step, and it's over.

31:30.246 --> 31:32.163
Yes, Finch.

31:32.165 --> 31:34.115
Mr. Reese, according
to Maddy's timetable,

31:34.117 --> 31:36.450
we have less than two minutes
to Nick Veldt's artery.

31:36.452 --> 31:38.486
Please tell me you have Amy
somewhere safe.

31:38.488 --> 31:41.789
I'm working on it, Finch.

31:54.436 --> 31:57.805
Agent Snow-- freeze.

31:57.807 --> 32:00.007
Turn around slowly.

32:05.030 --> 32:07.514
There's no signal down here.

32:07.516 --> 32:09.567
She can't hear us.

32:09.569 --> 32:10.951
What's goin' on, Mark?

32:10.953 --> 32:12.653
We don't have much time.

32:12.655 --> 32:13.737
I don't know
what she's planning,

32:13.739 --> 32:15.372
but you have to tell our friend.

32:15.374 --> 32:17.741
Whatever it is, it's big,
and I can't stop it.

32:17.743 --> 32:20.027
You killed a man for his ID

32:20.029 --> 32:21.695
to get inside that company,

32:21.697 --> 32:23.363
and then you shot a guard.

32:23.365 --> 32:25.549
Why?

32:27.035 --> 32:28.869
I had no choice.

32:28.871 --> 32:31.589
This is just the beginning.

32:31.591 --> 32:33.340
She's on a mission
with nothing left to lose.

32:33.342 --> 32:35.142
More people are gonna die.

32:35.144 --> 32:38.345
I'll call bomb disposal,
and I'll take you in.

32:38.347 --> 32:39.847
I'll get you out of this.

32:39.849 --> 32:41.182
She won't let you.

32:41.184 --> 32:43.717
She-- who is she?

33:13.431 --> 33:15.299
Mr. Rains,
we're on a clock--

33:15.301 --> 33:17.268
and please, don't contact
your British friend

33:17.270 --> 33:18.469
until you've heard me out.

33:18.471 --> 33:20.721
British friend?
What is this?

33:23.391 --> 33:24.858
Faxed to me by a friend.

33:24.860 --> 33:26.760
It's quite inclusive--

33:26.762 --> 33:28.762
all the blue pages,
the short sales,

33:28.764 --> 33:30.231
the fake company,

33:30.233 --> 33:32.533
and all that confidential
medical information

33:32.535 --> 33:34.101
that you shared with Wesley.

33:34.103 --> 33:35.669
Wesley? Who?

33:35.671 --> 33:38.772
How much did they pay you
to be their inside man?

33:38.774 --> 33:40.074
Inside man on what?

33:40.076 --> 33:42.660
The plot to kill your boss.

33:42.662 --> 33:44.461
Look, I have enough on you
to send you to prison

33:44.463 --> 33:46.747
for a long time.

33:46.749 --> 33:48.632
On a good day,
I just follow through with that.

33:48.634 --> 33:50.217
Today, I'll bargain.

33:50.219 --> 33:51.669
All the evidence I have
in exchange

33:51.671 --> 33:53.337
for your power
to call this thing off.

33:53.339 --> 33:55.055
Why would I wanna kill Oliver?

33:55.057 --> 33:56.957
After he recovers,
we're supposed to re-examine

33:56.959 --> 33:58.642
a new energy project together.

33:58.644 --> 34:01.845
The Wind Farm project--
you want that to be a reality?

34:01.847 --> 34:05.432
I don't know what all this is.
Is Oliver in danger?

34:05.434 --> 34:07.268
If that's the truth
and you didn't leak news

34:07.270 --> 34:10.654
of the surgery, who did?

34:16.661 --> 34:19.280
How's that other operation
we were discussing, doctor?

34:19.282 --> 34:21.114
Still in progress.

34:27.755 --> 34:29.089
What are you doing?

34:29.091 --> 34:31.158
Doctor, you have
to complete the procedure.

34:31.159 --> 34:32.659
We have to stop this.

34:32.661 --> 34:34.161
Everyone, I'm calling this--

34:34.163 --> 34:35.846
I want you all
to calmly exit the room.

34:35.848 --> 34:37.630
What about the patient?

34:37.632 --> 34:40.050
I'm declaring myself unfit
to continue this procedure.

34:40.052 --> 34:42.219
I will stabilize Mr. Veldt,
and then I will follow you.

34:42.221 --> 34:44.504
Now go.

34:44.505 --> 34:46.706
Everyone-- go.

34:48.310 --> 34:50.844
Mr. Reese,
get Amy out of there now.

34:50.846 --> 34:52.346
Listen up--

34:52.348 --> 34:56.233
start walking to the 40th Street
exit of the park.

34:56.235 --> 34:59.953
You had to do it
the hard way, doctor.

34:59.955 --> 35:02.356
Enough games.

35:02.358 --> 35:04.375
Calling all units--

35:04.377 --> 35:06.994
you are green-lit
on the target,

35:06.996 --> 35:09.529
then proceed to exfil.

35:14.552 --> 35:17.054
I'm staying with you, doctor.

35:17.056 --> 35:18.872
You can't do this alone.

35:21.559 --> 35:23.210
Liz and I will move the tools

35:23.212 --> 35:24.845
from Mr. Veldt's chest cavity.

35:24.847 --> 35:27.598
I need you to go to the cabinets
inside the scrub room

35:27.600 --> 35:30.484
and find me propofol so that
we can keep him unconscious.

35:30.486 --> 35:34.855
Whatever happens,
you made the right decision.

35:40.762 --> 35:42.863
Wesley, the target is gone,

35:42.865 --> 35:44.631
and she's not
on any of the cameras.

35:44.633 --> 35:48.235
Then someone
is very, very smart.

35:49.587 --> 35:51.805
Keep moving, Amy.

35:51.807 --> 35:53.374
There!

35:54.843 --> 35:57.344
You're almost there.

36:06.054 --> 36:08.422
- Hi, I'm John.
- Amy.

36:08.424 --> 36:11.892
Let's get you out of here, Amy.

36:16.731 --> 36:17.865
Hey, officer,
do me a favor, will ya?

36:17.867 --> 36:19.366
Tell your partner in the park

36:19.368 --> 36:21.101
I'm sorry
for busting his balls like that.

36:21.103 --> 36:23.270
Partner? What partner?

36:23.272 --> 36:25.606
I walk the park beat alone.

36:34.299 --> 36:37.384
Your wife should've listened.

36:42.590 --> 36:43.724
He's crashing.

36:43.726 --> 36:45.592
His BP is plummeting.

36:45.594 --> 36:46.810
He's going into V-tach.

36:46.812 --> 36:50.514
You must've nicked an artery.

36:52.600 --> 36:54.151
It was you.

36:54.153 --> 36:55.936
- You made the incision.
- No.

36:55.938 --> 36:59.606
You're the surgeon, doctor.
I'm just the nurse.

36:59.608 --> 37:02.192
Or, in this case,
the backup plan.

37:15.472 --> 37:17.706
Hey, Officer--
about that abduction.

37:26.951 --> 37:29.001
You knew they were
going to hurt Amy.

37:29.003 --> 37:31.870
Just let him die.

37:31.872 --> 37:33.822
I'm not gonna let him die.

37:33.824 --> 37:36.258
Understand what's at stake
for you, doctor.

37:36.260 --> 37:37.993
It's just one life.

37:37.995 --> 37:40.879
It's still a life.

37:52.609 --> 37:54.777
Stay with her.

38:10.543 --> 38:13.195
I gave him protamine sulfate

38:13.197 --> 38:15.714
- to coagulate his blood again...
- Oh...

38:15.716 --> 38:17.383
But I'm gonna have
to restart his heart,

38:17.385 --> 38:19.752
and I won't be able
to do that from the outside.

38:19.754 --> 38:21.503
What does that mean?

38:21.505 --> 38:24.590
I'm gonna open him up,
and you're gonna assist me.

38:24.592 --> 38:27.226
I am?

38:28.211 --> 38:30.512
Pass me that, Richardson.

38:30.514 --> 38:33.548
That's it-- I need you to pull
with a lot of pressure, okay?

38:33.550 --> 38:36.551
I'm gonna take
this Finochietto retractor.

38:36.553 --> 38:38.737
Now, hold the chest op--
okay, yeah.

38:38.739 --> 38:40.272
Just keep it pulled.

38:40.274 --> 38:41.690
I don't think I can--

38:41.692 --> 38:43.158
You can do it.

38:43.160 --> 38:46.895
Need lots of suction
so I can see this artery.

38:46.897 --> 38:49.114
That's it.
There we go.

38:49.116 --> 38:51.566
Okay, pass me the clamp.

38:51.568 --> 38:54.403
I'm going to clamp this now.

38:54.405 --> 38:57.339
Suture it later to stop
the arterial bleeding.

38:57.341 --> 38:59.675
Now I'm going to begin
open heart massage.

38:59.677 --> 39:01.343
All right.

39:01.345 --> 39:03.462
Oh, dear.

39:03.464 --> 39:05.597
Look at it.

39:05.599 --> 39:08.734
It's squishy.

39:08.736 --> 39:11.420
Come on.

39:15.518 --> 39:16.674
We did it.

39:17.862 --> 39:20.312
We got him back.

39:32.959 --> 39:35.477
Hey, Mads.

39:41.918 --> 39:44.336
I thought I was gonna lose you.

39:44.338 --> 39:45.337
No.

39:45.339 --> 39:47.973
I'm here.

39:47.975 --> 39:51.927
I'm right here.

40:05.658 --> 40:07.009
Sorry for the theatrics,
Mr. Tao,

40:07.011 --> 40:08.243
but we couldn't have you
turning up

40:08.245 --> 40:09.828
knocking on our door.

40:09.830 --> 40:12.581
What if I was collecting
for UNICEF?

40:17.704 --> 40:20.322
So Veldt survived, huh?

40:20.324 --> 40:21.423
And as long as he recovers,

40:21.425 --> 40:22.958
that stock won't dip an inch.

40:22.960 --> 40:25.878
All the conspirators
will take a huge loss.

40:25.880 --> 40:27.596
You defeated the bad guys.

40:27.598 --> 40:28.797
With your help.

40:28.799 --> 40:30.599
Take that to mind and try

40:30.601 --> 40:32.501
to stay out of trouble,
Mr. Tao.

40:33.838 --> 40:35.137
You know,
I'm not the kind of guy

40:35.139 --> 40:37.890
that would let you down.

40:50.787 --> 40:53.121
Think we'll be seeing
him again any time soon?

40:53.123 --> 40:55.257
Stranger things have happened.

41:01.232 --> 41:03.499
That's not your phone,
Mr. Reese.

41:03.501 --> 41:06.885
I took it off the sniper
in the park.

41:06.887 --> 41:08.220
Hello, Wesley.

41:08.222 --> 41:09.588
I just had to call
and congratulate you

41:09.590 --> 41:11.139
on a game well played.

41:11.141 --> 41:12.374
It wasn't a game.

41:12.376 --> 41:13.542
Lives were at stake.

41:13.544 --> 41:15.377
And after that elaborate plan,

41:15.379 --> 41:18.180
you were no more than
a common thief.

41:18.182 --> 41:20.399
You know I'm much more
than that.

41:20.401 --> 41:22.484
After our meeting,
I knew you looked familiar.

41:22.486 --> 41:23.986
You're John Reese.

41:23.988 --> 41:26.888
Our paths have crossed before
in Istanbul

41:26.890 --> 41:28.957
at that market
by the Bosphorus.

41:28.959 --> 41:30.442
I remember the market.

41:30.444 --> 41:32.060
I don't remember you.

41:32.062 --> 41:33.328
Well, that's the point.

41:33.330 --> 41:34.997
I was trained that way
for a reason.

41:34.999 --> 41:36.198
Those were the days.

41:36.200 --> 41:37.616
International manhunts.

41:37.618 --> 41:39.201
Drone strikes.

41:39.203 --> 41:41.703
Now sometime we should finish
that drink.

41:41.705 --> 41:45.507
I'm sure you and I would have
a lot to talk about.

41:45.509 --> 41:47.626
Until then.

41:50.547 --> 41:51.880
John F. Kennedy, please.

41:51.882 --> 41:55.133
International terminal.

41:59.172 --> 42:02.608
It seems Wesley enjoys
a good game, Mr. Reese.

42:02.610 --> 42:06.979
And I'm sure we'll have
the chance to play again.

42:19.074 --> 42:21.209
Been doing a little work
on the side?

42:21.211 --> 42:23.845
I'm a Homicide Detective, John.

42:23.847 --> 42:25.697
You know what I do.

42:25.699 --> 42:27.532
You shouldn't have brought me
in on this

42:27.534 --> 42:29.634
if you didn't want me
asking questions.

42:29.636 --> 42:31.970
- You sure it was Snow?
- I saw him fleeing

42:31.972 --> 42:33.805
the scene of the crime

42:33.807 --> 42:36.191
wearing a bomb vest.

42:36.193 --> 42:38.076
He looked desperate, helpless,

42:38.078 --> 42:40.362
like someone was holding him
on a string.

42:40.364 --> 42:44.432
Said to tell you that <i>she</i>
is planning something.

42:44.434 --> 42:46.601
Something big.

42:46.603 --> 42:49.037
- Who?
- That's what I wanna know.

42:49.039 --> 42:52.273
Do you know what this
is all about, John?

42:52.275 --> 42:56.161
And if you did,
would you even tell me?

43:00.816 --> 43:03.618
You're one hell of
a Detective, Carter.

43:03.620 --> 43:06.054
And I can't stop you
from looking.

43:06.056 --> 43:09.624
But you already know quite a bit
about me, Finch,

43:09.626 --> 43:14.346
and you may know we both had
people who once cared about us.

43:14.348 --> 43:16.631
Not anymore.

43:16.633 --> 43:19.251
But you...

43:19.253 --> 43:21.303
You still have your son,

43:21.305 --> 43:25.073
your life is still yours.

43:25.075 --> 43:26.825
So I think the real question

43:26.827 --> 43:30.278
you have to ask yourself,
Detective...

43:30.280 --> 43:33.832
is how much more
do you really want to know?
