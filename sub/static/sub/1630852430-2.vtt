(BIRDSONG)

25:15.153 --> 25:16.773
I know we said
we'd see what happens,

25:16.873 --> 25:18.333
but me arbitrarily disappearing

25:18.433 --> 25:21.273
isn't one of the challenges
I'd factored into the equation.

25:28.034 --> 25:30.034
She just...

25:32.315 --> 25:34.315
She just wasn't there anymore.

25:40.115 --> 25:42.556
I didn't know what had happened.

25:44.716 --> 25:47.436
One day, she just left
and then never came back.

25:51.237 --> 25:53.237
And...

25:56.557 --> 25:58.057
(SIGHS)

25:58.157 --> 26:00.158
..it could happen to you.

26:06.238 --> 26:08.539
It sounds so dumb, but I, um...

26:08.639 --> 26:10.919
-It's just, like...
-You don't want me to die.

26:14.759 --> 26:16.759
Yeah.

26:18.920 --> 26:20.920
I didn't know you were
so worried about that.

26:22.720 --> 26:24.720
Neither did I.

26:28.681 --> 26:30.181
You know I'm gonna die one day.

26:30.281 --> 26:32.141
-You're gonna die...
-Oly.

26:32.241 --> 26:33.621
-J's gonna die.
-Shh.

26:33.721 --> 26:36.022
-We're all gonna die.
-Uh-uh.

26:36.122 --> 26:39.462
I reckon we're gonna be the
first family to live forever.

26:39.562 --> 26:40.942
(LAUGHS) OK.

26:41.042 --> 26:44.182
Remember that when we're 35
and we hate our lives.

26:44.282 --> 26:47.263
J's not speaking to us
because we're mad at her

26:47.363 --> 26:49.363
'cause she got a tattoo in Bali.

26:53.803 --> 26:55.704
Did you get a tattoo
on your penis?

26:55.804 --> 26:57.944
-What?
-Nothing. Nothing.

26:58.044 --> 27:01.284
-Why did you ask that?
-It's nothing. No reason.

27:03.565 --> 27:05.565
(OLY LAUGHS)

27:08.965 --> 27:10.965
I'm so sorry about your mum.

27:15.726 --> 27:17.826
If you're freaking out,

27:17.926 --> 27:20.446
can you just tell me
that you're freaking out?

27:23.807 --> 27:25.807
Mm-hm.

27:27.407 --> 27:28.787
Yep.

27:37.608 --> 27:38.788
Hey?

27:38.888 --> 27:40.109
Yeah?

27:40.209 --> 27:42.209
Um...

27:44.409 --> 27:46.349
..did you still wanna have sex
in the toilets?

27:49.730 --> 27:50.830
Yep!
