00:02.400 --> 00:04.167
Previously on
"Hit The Floor"...

00:04.233 --> 00:05.467
Something came up
in my physical.

00:05.533 --> 00:06.900
I have to see
a doctor tomorrow.

00:06.967 --> 00:08.100
It's my heart.

00:09.167 --> 00:10.300
What's wrong?

00:11.667 --> 00:12.633
Raquel?!

00:12.700 --> 00:14.400
The only
evidence they have

00:14.467 --> 00:16.800
is from a medical examiner
who skipped town.

00:16.867 --> 00:17.800
Help me from him.

00:17.867 --> 00:19.000
Clear my name.

00:19.067 --> 00:20.467
A mother wouldn't
have let her daughter

00:20.533 --> 00:22.200
live in a house with
a violent man,

00:22.267 --> 00:24.167
no matter
how much she loved him!

00:24.233 --> 00:26.867
I felt bad 'cause you
didn't have a father.

00:26.933 --> 00:28.167
You didn't have
a mother either.

00:28.233 --> 00:29.767
I do want kids.

00:29.833 --> 00:32.100
If you are ever
gonna know,

00:32.167 --> 00:33.233
you need to face it.

00:33.300 --> 00:34.867
I'm talking about
your father.

00:34.933 --> 00:36.500
This is Sloane's life.

00:36.567 --> 00:38.500
We both know she
didn't murder anyone.

00:38.567 --> 00:39.867
You're gonna have to
make a statement.

00:39.933 --> 00:40.867
Saying what?

00:40.933 --> 00:42.133
Either help her
or bury her.

00:42.200 --> 00:43.267
Is there bad blood
since she started

00:43.333 --> 00:44.500
the forced sale
to begin with?

00:44.567 --> 00:45.300
She what?

00:45.367 --> 00:46.967
I hope she fries.

00:47.033 --> 00:48.533
Do you know more
about Olivia's death

00:48.600 --> 00:50.233
than you're
letting on?
Yes.

00:50.300 --> 00:51.767
Please trust me.
Trust you?!

00:51.833 --> 00:54.133
German, my mom's been charged
with Olivia's murder.

00:54.200 --> 00:55.867
You can't hide
from this anymore.

00:55.933 --> 00:57.233
German?

00:57.300 --> 00:59.600
Sloane Hayes didn't
kill Olivia.

00:59.667 --> 01:00.733
I did.

01:21.500 --> 01:22.767
Let's go.

01:24.300 --> 01:25.433
You have the right
to remain silent...

01:25.500 --> 01:27.133
How long
have you known?

01:27.200 --> 01:28.833
You knew?

01:28.900 --> 01:30.633
Yes, but
I never thought--

01:30.700 --> 01:32.067
He really did it?

01:32.100 --> 01:34.267
He found out Olivia
was threatening her.

01:35.533 --> 01:36.733
Or wanted to.

01:37.933 --> 01:39.100
What did Olivia
have over you?

01:39.167 --> 01:40.700
This is the last
time I'm asking.

01:41.767 --> 01:43.133
I didn't win all-star
over Jelena.

01:44.667 --> 01:46.733
Olivia fixed it for me.

01:46.800 --> 01:49.167
Jelena was going to
win again and I just...

01:49.233 --> 01:50.367
Ahsha.

01:50.433 --> 01:52.200
Why didn't you
tell any of us?

01:52.267 --> 01:54.633
Because of how you're all
looking at me... right now.

01:56.700 --> 01:58.400
I don't blame you.

01:58.467 --> 02:00.200
Ahsha Hayes
is a good girl.

02:00.267 --> 02:02.367
Ahsha Hayes doesn't
do stuff like this

02:02.433 --> 02:04.133
except I did.

02:04.200 --> 02:06.633
I tried to use who my father
was to help me win all-star,

02:06.700 --> 02:08.800
and when that didn't work,
I stole it.

02:08.867 --> 02:10.100
Those were my decisions.

02:10.167 --> 02:11.633
German was
trying to protect me

02:11.700 --> 02:12.933
and now his life's
ruined.

02:17.100 --> 02:18.533
... late last night.

02:18.600 --> 02:20.467
Vega's confession has rocked
Devils Nation

02:20.533 --> 02:21.800
with Olivia Vincent's killer

02:21.867 --> 02:23.867
inside Devils Arena
the whole time.

02:23.933 --> 02:25.233
This is horrible.

02:25.300 --> 02:27.400
Maybe mainline coverage
isn't the best idea

02:27.467 --> 02:28.400
given your condition.

02:30.100 --> 02:31.200
Kyle...

02:31.267 --> 02:33.500
for the millionth time,
I'm fine.

02:33.567 --> 02:34.933
Even the doctor said so.

02:35.067 --> 02:36.867
The doctor didn't watch you
to take a gold-medal dive

02:36.933 --> 02:38.933
onto
the kitchen floor.

02:39.067 --> 02:41.467
I misjudged my
medication, that's all.

02:41.533 --> 02:42.833
Haven't you ever
made a mistake?

02:45.067 --> 02:48.267
You must have
other things to focus on.

02:48.333 --> 02:49.800
Actually, I do.

02:49.867 --> 02:53.400
Thanks to Lionel catapulting
Jelena out of the arena...

02:53.467 --> 02:56.067
and German, well...

02:56.067 --> 02:57.867
Ahsha's first move
as captain was putting me

02:57.933 --> 02:59.200
in charge of
today's dance.

03:00.467 --> 03:02.700
Had the Devil Girls ever
worn nipple tassels?

03:02.767 --> 03:04.400
Ha-ha.

03:06.567 --> 03:08.100
You can come see
for yourself.

03:08.167 --> 03:10.200
If you're
feeling up to it.

03:10.267 --> 03:11.767
Of course,
I'll be there.

03:13.267 --> 03:14.567
I'm fine, Kyle.

03:14.633 --> 03:16.233
Say it back.

03:16.300 --> 03:17.300
You're fine.

03:26.800 --> 03:28.733
I know you're doing
this for us.

03:28.800 --> 03:30.167
If you need me to
come in with you...

03:31.700 --> 03:33.067
I need to
do this alone.

03:34.633 --> 03:36.067
Okay.

03:36.100 --> 03:37.467
I'm right outside
if you need me.

03:53.200 --> 03:54.133
My little girl.

03:55.833 --> 03:56.967
All grown up.

04:03.133 --> 04:04.300
How do you feel
about this turn in

04:04.367 --> 04:06.300
the Olivia Vincent
murder case?

04:06.367 --> 04:08.067
I'm grateful to be cleared of
all charges

04:08.100 --> 04:09.967
but my thoughts
are with German.

04:10.067 --> 04:11.867
I just hope he's
treated fairly.

04:11.933 --> 04:12.867
And is it strange
returning to work

04:12.933 --> 04:14.333
for Lionel Davenport,

04:14.400 --> 04:16.367
a woman who publicly said
she'd hope you'd fry?

04:17.967 --> 04:21.200
When I was charged, there were
questions about my innocence.

04:21.267 --> 04:22.400
It's hard to judge someone

04:22.467 --> 04:23.800
when you're not
in their position.

04:25.933 --> 04:27.600
But I judge Lionel.

04:27.667 --> 04:29.233
She was irresponsible.

04:29.300 --> 04:31.233
And hopefully everyone,
including the league,

04:31.300 --> 04:32.967
will see her
for who she really is.

04:34.300 --> 04:36.067
We've learned that
Vega's refusing

04:36.133 --> 04:37.667
to provide a motive.

04:37.733 --> 04:41.200
This is a man who could serve
25 years to life

04:41.267 --> 04:43.433
in a maximum-security prison.

04:43.500 --> 04:45.567
The fact that he won't
say anything,

04:45.633 --> 04:47.333
to me, says everything.

04:47.400 --> 04:48.900
This person's making it
sound like German's

04:48.967 --> 04:50.100
a cold-blooded killer.

04:51.233 --> 04:52.933
Why won't
he defend himself?

04:53.067 --> 04:55.067
He... he might
just need time.

04:55.133 --> 04:56.800
He's about to
get a lot of it.

04:59.067 --> 05:01.167
I have to do something.
Like what?

05:01.233 --> 05:03.133
The only thing
I can do--

05:03.200 --> 05:05.067
try to talk
some sense into him.

05:08.633 --> 05:11.500
I was gone one day
and all hell breaks loose.

05:11.567 --> 05:13.100
It's not my fault

05:13.167 --> 05:15.433
that my assistant coach
murdered someone.

05:15.500 --> 05:17.200
No, but did you
have to tell the press

05:17.267 --> 05:18.833
you hope Sloane
fried for it?

05:18.900 --> 05:19.833
I was pushed.

05:19.900 --> 05:21.200
Were you also pushed

05:21.267 --> 05:22.867
to kick Terrence and Jelena
out of the arena?

05:22.933 --> 05:24.100
Fans are pissed.

05:24.167 --> 05:26.200
Terrence and Jelena
flipped Derek.

05:27.333 --> 05:29.433
He's backing them
with the league now.

05:29.500 --> 05:30.633
And Sloane instigated

05:30.700 --> 05:32.600
this whole forced sale
to begin with,

05:32.667 --> 05:34.867
so, yes...
I was pushed.

05:35.933 --> 05:37.367
I didn't know
any of that.

05:37.433 --> 05:38.933
Well, I didn't know
you were getting

05:39.067 --> 05:40.333
mani-pedis with Oscar.

05:42.067 --> 05:43.900
So if you wanna
talk about smart...

05:48.833 --> 05:50.333
I went to see
him a few times.

05:51.867 --> 05:53.167
The last time he
asked me to track down

05:53.233 --> 05:55.700
the medical examiner
from the recording,

05:55.767 --> 05:57.733
the one saying
Oscar had Mia killed.

05:57.800 --> 05:58.933
Did you?

05:59.067 --> 06:00.333
I did.

06:00.400 --> 06:03.067
But Oscar's case lives
or dies by that recording.

06:03.067 --> 06:04.600
If you could get to the ME,

06:04.667 --> 06:07.700
he'd figure out some way
to use him, to get out.

06:07.767 --> 06:09.133
I wasn't
going to risk that.

06:11.100 --> 06:12.767
I'm as done with
Oscar as you are.

06:12.833 --> 06:13.967
Good.

06:15.100 --> 06:18.433
Look, Terrence and Jelena
was one thing.

06:18.500 --> 06:20.400
But what you
said about Sloane...

06:22.067 --> 06:24.467
Lionel, you need to go out
in front of the press

06:24.533 --> 06:25.533
and apologize to her.

06:27.100 --> 06:28.300
I'd throw myself off

06:28.367 --> 06:29.967
the roof of
this arena first.

06:31.267 --> 06:32.733
If you don't fix this,
there'll be plenty of

06:32.800 --> 06:34.133
people lining up
to help you.

06:41.167 --> 06:43.267
So I'm managing
three buildings now.

06:43.333 --> 06:45.467
Clocking 80 hours
a week.

06:45.533 --> 06:47.100
I'm surprised you were
able to find the time

06:47.167 --> 06:48.800
to come to LA.

06:48.867 --> 06:50.300
Your mother
worked out my schedule.

06:50.367 --> 06:53.900
That woman can do anything
she puts her mind to.

06:53.967 --> 06:55.367
So this was
her doing.

06:56.900 --> 06:58.200
Well, she organized
the trip,

06:58.267 --> 07:01.133
but...
I wanted to see you.

07:01.200 --> 07:02.433
It's been too long.

07:02.500 --> 07:04.067
Do you know why
that might be?

07:05.600 --> 07:07.067
You've been busy.

07:07.133 --> 07:08.733
You're famous now.

07:08.800 --> 07:09.733
That's it?

07:11.067 --> 07:12.133
And you got engaged.

07:13.200 --> 07:14.467
I did get engaged...

07:15.600 --> 07:17.233
... to a man
who wants kids.

07:18.333 --> 07:19.567
I'm not sure
that I do.

07:21.333 --> 07:22.633
It's a personal
decision.

07:24.333 --> 07:25.467
Why did you
have one?

07:29.867 --> 07:31.267
Why does anyone?

07:32.700 --> 07:35.267
Some people can't
take care of them.

07:37.133 --> 07:39.133
Some people can't
take care of themselves.

07:40.400 --> 07:41.833
If you have
a question, Jelena--

07:41.900 --> 07:43.267
I have a lot
of questions.

07:47.367 --> 07:49.200
How can a waitress
just disappear?

07:49.267 --> 07:51.300
How can a man
beat his wife?

07:56.067 --> 07:57.367
Your mother and I
worked that out.

07:58.633 --> 08:00.367
I'm not talking
about you and her.

08:01.667 --> 08:03.233
I'm talking about
you and me.

08:04.300 --> 08:06.233
You were so young
back then.

08:06.300 --> 08:08.333
I mean, how much
could you even remember?

08:09.867 --> 08:11.800
I was eight.

08:11.867 --> 08:13.267
We'd just got
home from church

08:13.333 --> 08:15.467
and something in the sermon
set you off enough

08:15.533 --> 08:17.867
to throw her
against the stove.

08:17.933 --> 08:21.067
Also eight, you punched her
because the TV went out.

08:28.333 --> 08:29.667
I'm not doing so good.

08:33.467 --> 08:36.233
I need to understand
a few things so that...

08:37.533 --> 08:39.367
... I can move on
with my life.

08:43.133 --> 08:44.300
I don't care
what you say,

08:44.367 --> 08:46.200
I don't care how
bad it sounds.

08:48.333 --> 08:49.767
I just need
you to be honest.

08:58.333 --> 09:00.700
I just don't see the point
of digging up the past.

09:05.900 --> 09:06.833
What's good here?

09:17.067 --> 09:18.167
We're here to
see German Vega.

09:18.233 --> 09:19.267
Names?

09:19.333 --> 09:20.867
Pete Davenport,
Ahsha Hayes.

09:25.700 --> 09:26.933
All right,
he'll see you.

09:27.067 --> 09:28.600
Thank you.
Just Mr. Davenport.

09:28.667 --> 09:29.633
What do you mean?

09:29.700 --> 09:30.900
He won't see you.

09:30.967 --> 09:32.533
He won't see me?

09:32.600 --> 09:33.867
Well, he's gonna see me!

09:40.567 --> 09:41.767
Tell German Vega
that Chase Vincent

09:41.833 --> 09:42.967
wants to talk to him.

09:44.067 --> 09:45.267
Family members
of the victim

09:45.333 --> 09:47.467
are prohibited
from any visitation.

09:47.533 --> 09:48.667
It's policy.

09:52.800 --> 09:54.167
Your assistant coach
killed my wife.

09:54.233 --> 09:56.067
I think there's more
to the story, Chase.

09:56.133 --> 09:57.600
Yeah, the story
is she's dead.

09:59.600 --> 10:00.767
I'm gonna make sure
German Vega never sees

10:00.833 --> 10:02.100
the light of
day again.

10:13.533 --> 10:15.333
So...

10:15.400 --> 10:16.633
how did lunch go?

10:18.567 --> 10:20.033
Your father
said great things.

10:23.367 --> 10:24.500
I see.

10:25.967 --> 10:27.800
How can you blindly
ignore the past?

10:29.167 --> 10:30.100
Denial...

10:32.233 --> 10:33.533
... is a powerful thing.

10:35.800 --> 10:37.233
If we work on
him together...

10:39.767 --> 10:40.700
No.

10:43.100 --> 10:44.667
This is between
you and him.

10:47.800 --> 10:50.100
It's between me
and... no one.

10:52.767 --> 10:55.467
You can't get passed
walls like that, trust me.

10:55.533 --> 10:56.900
I know.

10:58.100 --> 11:00.467
I didn't get my
stubbornness from you.

11:00.533 --> 11:01.667
People can change.

11:03.233 --> 11:05.800
Who would've thought that the
two of you would even speak,

11:05.867 --> 11:08.167
that you would be
the one to bring him here?

11:11.633 --> 11:13.267
Still, I have
nothing to show for it.

11:16.200 --> 11:19.267
I will never get any kind of
closure out of that man.

11:20.933 --> 11:22.867
And nothing will
ever be different.

11:34.467 --> 11:37.067
Sold out,
primetime.

11:37.133 --> 11:38.533
Can you stand it?

11:38.600 --> 11:39.733
I got this.

11:44.067 --> 11:45.067
Look at me.

11:45.067 --> 11:46.600
I'm still a virgin
at something.

11:46.667 --> 11:48.067
Who would've thunk it.

11:48.133 --> 11:49.300
I don't think
you're ready.

11:55.300 --> 11:56.333
Now you're ready.

11:59.567 --> 12:00.767
Whoo...

14:12.833 --> 14:14.200
I'm giddy with
anticipation.

14:17.433 --> 14:18.833
I'm willing to admit

14:18.900 --> 14:20.800
I went
a little overboard

14:20.867 --> 14:23.067
when I told the press
what I told them.

14:24.767 --> 14:27.767
I misunderstood
your situation...

14:27.833 --> 14:29.133
and I apologize.

14:30.700 --> 14:32.500
Could you possibly...

14:32.567 --> 14:34.067
ease up on me
with the press?

14:36.167 --> 14:38.167
I find it fascinating

14:38.233 --> 14:40.100
that you want
my public support

14:40.167 --> 14:43.433
when this apology is
happening in private.

14:44.733 --> 14:45.767
Let's be real,
Sloane.

14:45.833 --> 14:46.900
You, real?

14:46.967 --> 14:48.167
This only gets richer.

14:48.233 --> 14:50.800
The only reason
I said what I said

14:50.867 --> 14:52.167
was because I found out
you started

14:52.233 --> 14:53.400
the forced sale.

14:53.467 --> 14:55.567
Which I only did because
you bulldozed your way

14:55.633 --> 14:56.767
into the arena

14:56.833 --> 14:58.633
and made everyone's
lives a living hell.

14:59.700 --> 15:01.433
This isn't about
everyone.

15:01.500 --> 15:03.133
This is about you.

15:03.200 --> 15:04.967
You couldn't stand
that I had Pete.

15:05.067 --> 15:06.633
You couldn't stand
that I had the team.

15:06.700 --> 15:09.400
You just can't stop taking
things from me, Sloane.

15:09.467 --> 15:11.200
I haven't taken
a damn thing from you.

15:12.500 --> 15:13.567
What about my baby?

15:18.367 --> 15:19.967
I was pregnant...

15:20.067 --> 15:22.833
until I saw you
and my baby's father

15:22.900 --> 15:24.333
fawning all over
each other.

15:25.633 --> 15:28.200
Let's just say that that
didn't turn out so well.

15:30.267 --> 15:32.600
My life has been
threatened.

15:34.067 --> 15:36.733
My entire family
threatened,

15:36.800 --> 15:38.433
thanks in no
small part to you.

15:40.867 --> 15:42.167
Support you?

15:44.800 --> 15:47.100
You're lucky
I don't flatten you!

15:57.900 --> 15:59.133
It's not just the press.

15:59.200 --> 16:01.700
It's the board questioning
Lionel now too.

16:01.767 --> 16:03.133
I mean, they're
minority owners

16:03.200 --> 16:04.367
but their opinions
matter.

16:05.433 --> 16:07.067
Maybe you should
do something.

16:07.133 --> 16:08.367
I already have.

16:08.433 --> 16:10.567
I made a double date
with Marcus Douglas.

16:10.633 --> 16:12.333
He's got the most sway
of anyone on the board.

16:15.367 --> 16:17.433
I can't risk
bringing Lionel.

16:17.500 --> 16:19.267
God knows what will come out
of her mouth right now.

16:21.533 --> 16:22.933
Would you go with me?

16:23.067 --> 16:24.933
What, you want me
to be the little wifey?

16:26.100 --> 16:27.833
More like
the big, bad baller.

16:27.900 --> 16:29.400
Marcus thinks you
can do no wrong.

16:31.233 --> 16:33.200
Well, he obviously
doesn't know me very well.

16:36.067 --> 16:38.067
You're thinking about
your sister.

16:38.067 --> 16:40.967
Listen, there's this
private investigator I use.

16:41.067 --> 16:42.800
He's good.

16:42.867 --> 16:44.200
Maybe he can
help you find her.

16:46.133 --> 16:47.833
What I need to find is

16:47.900 --> 16:50.300
something big, bad
and "ballery"

16:50.367 --> 16:51.600
to wear to
this double date.

17:00.433 --> 17:01.367
Thank you.

17:03.767 --> 17:05.667
No luck?

17:05.733 --> 17:07.067
German
still won't see me.

17:07.100 --> 17:08.600
Maybe he's afraid
to face anyone.

17:08.667 --> 17:09.633
He saw Pete.

17:11.700 --> 17:12.633
He hates me.

17:12.700 --> 17:13.967
He doesn't hate you.

17:14.067 --> 17:15.233
I might be working
at a bank right now

17:15.300 --> 17:16.600
if it weren't
for German.

17:18.633 --> 17:20.567
I might not have tried out
for the Devil Girls.

17:21.933 --> 17:22.967
He believed in me,

17:23.067 --> 17:24.900
and I'm living my dreams
and he's--

17:24.967 --> 17:25.900
Look, Ahsha, you--

17:25.967 --> 17:28.667
He's given up
on himself.

17:28.733 --> 17:29.933
And there's
nothing I can do

17:30.067 --> 17:31.633
because he's given up
on me too.

17:36.500 --> 17:38.667
I'm not saying everyone who
watched that dance saw Jesus,

17:38.733 --> 17:41.367
but he may have winked at a few
people from the Jumbotron.

17:44.667 --> 17:47.067
Why are you filling out
Miguel's school registration?

17:47.133 --> 17:48.900
That's not due for
another year.

17:48.967 --> 17:50.400
I just wanna get
a jump on things.

17:53.067 --> 17:54.200
Jump or leap?

17:54.267 --> 17:55.467
Miguel's a little young

17:55.533 --> 17:57.300
to be going on your
bank account, isn't he?

18:01.400 --> 18:02.667
You're not fine,
are you?

18:04.167 --> 18:06.333
I didn't misjudge
my medication.

18:06.400 --> 18:07.633
My heart's
gotten worse.

18:09.433 --> 18:12.100
So... we get
you new meds.

18:12.167 --> 18:14.500
We got you fixed up once,
we can fix you again.

18:14.567 --> 18:16.167
No.

18:16.233 --> 18:17.367
We can't.

18:18.600 --> 18:20.333
That's what the doctor
really told me.

18:21.600 --> 18:25.067
He said I should
tie up loose ends,

18:25.133 --> 18:27.333
make... arrangements.

18:30.200 --> 18:31.333
Months?

18:36.567 --> 18:37.500
Weeks?

18:55.533 --> 18:58.567
We know you're upset, Chase,
and you have every right to be.

18:58.633 --> 19:01.167
We were hoping if we told you
a little about German

19:01.233 --> 19:03.300
that you'd
go easier on him.

19:03.367 --> 19:05.100
You didn't bring me
here to convince me

19:05.167 --> 19:07.567
that German Vega's
a good guy?

19:07.633 --> 19:09.400
He is, actually.

19:11.533 --> 19:13.200
People make mistakes,
Chase.

19:14.767 --> 19:17.167
There was a time you
could've used a friend.

19:17.233 --> 19:18.600
Yeah, I can use
a couple right now.

19:19.833 --> 19:22.467
German told Ahsha
it was an accident.

19:22.533 --> 19:25.233
He accidentally showed up
at my house that night?

19:25.300 --> 19:27.267
He accidentally pushed
Olivia over a railing?

19:28.500 --> 19:29.867
He accidentally left her
there on the floor

19:29.933 --> 19:31.700
so I could find her?

19:31.767 --> 19:33.067
And you
believe that?

19:33.067 --> 19:34.267
I do.

19:34.333 --> 19:35.767
He's not a killer.

19:35.833 --> 19:37.500
And yet my wife
is dead!

19:39.633 --> 19:41.700
Maybe you don't know German
as well as you think you do.

19:43.833 --> 19:45.067
Maybe you didn't
know Olivia

19:45.100 --> 19:46.467
as well as you
think you did.

19:47.933 --> 19:49.433
So this was
Olivia's fault?

19:49.500 --> 19:51.467
Come on, Chase-- Chase,
the four of us go back too far.

19:51.533 --> 19:54.067
And where were you
when I was in jail?

19:54.133 --> 19:55.700
Huh, buddy?

19:55.767 --> 19:57.333
You did nothing to
reach out to Olivia

19:57.400 --> 19:59.267
when you came back
on the scene.

19:59.333 --> 20:01.467
She tried, tried,
and you broke her heart!

20:01.533 --> 20:03.867
She was the same
instigator she always was.

20:03.933 --> 20:05.867
And you're the same
crackhead you always were--

20:05.933 --> 20:06.867
Whoa, whoa, Chase!

20:06.933 --> 20:08.200
Chase!

20:16.700 --> 20:18.400
Doubles double date.

20:18.467 --> 20:20.300
Kind of literal,
don't you think?

20:20.367 --> 20:22.133
I would've said yes to
competitive hot dog eating

20:22.200 --> 20:24.233
if it made Marcus happy.

20:24.300 --> 20:25.833
Is that his wife?

20:25.900 --> 20:26.833
His wife's in Cabo.

20:28.633 --> 20:30.133
I thought Lionel
might be joining us.

20:30.200 --> 20:31.467
She wanted to.

20:31.533 --> 20:32.900
She's hard at work,
protecting the fort.

20:32.967 --> 20:35.333
She wouldn't have to be if
she stopped inviting attack.

20:37.667 --> 20:39.633
But then...
it's not every day

20:39.700 --> 20:42.333
I get to play against
a super star, hmm?

20:42.400 --> 20:44.467
You wanna serve first?

20:44.533 --> 20:45.833
Sure.

20:45.900 --> 20:47.233
All right, let's go.

21:01.133 --> 21:02.533
What?
I never said I was good.

21:12.067 --> 21:13.233
Have you told
Miguel yet?

21:14.533 --> 21:16.167
I wanna talk to
his father first.

21:18.700 --> 21:20.867
I just can't bring
myself to call him.

21:22.133 --> 21:23.833
I haven't seen
Jesse since...

21:28.067 --> 21:29.933
Whatever you need me
to do I'll do it.

21:31.600 --> 21:32.833
There's nothing
to be done.

21:39.500 --> 21:41.267
This happens
to other people.

21:43.267 --> 21:44.733
I never thought
for a second

21:44.800 --> 21:45.767
it could happen to me.

21:48.767 --> 21:49.833
I need to make sure

21:49.900 --> 21:52.833
that I get done
everything I need to do.

21:52.900 --> 21:54.267
For me, for Miguel.

21:57.100 --> 21:58.233
No regrets.

22:09.500 --> 22:11.733
It's been made clear I'm not
welcome inside this arena.

22:11.800 --> 22:13.067
Once you're off
the injured list,

22:13.067 --> 22:14.800
I won't let Lionel
keep you out.

22:14.867 --> 22:16.567
Is that why you
called me in here?

22:16.633 --> 22:18.200
I didn't call you
in here.

22:18.267 --> 22:19.467
She did.

22:21.567 --> 22:22.700
Too much is out of control
around here.

22:23.967 --> 22:24.900
I need to grab
the reins.

22:26.200 --> 22:28.267
I don't trust Jelena.

22:28.333 --> 22:31.300
And the fact that
you do scares me.

22:31.367 --> 22:33.067
But Lionel needs to go.

22:34.533 --> 22:35.800
I know you lost
Jackson.

22:35.867 --> 22:37.800
Do you have someone else
who could fund your bid?

22:40.167 --> 22:41.567
After we lost Jackson,

22:41.633 --> 22:43.167
a few people offered
to step up

22:43.233 --> 22:44.467
but there's
nothing to fund.

22:44.533 --> 22:46.067
The team's off
the market.

22:46.067 --> 22:47.467
That's about to change.

22:47.533 --> 22:48.800
The league
is still behind me.

22:50.733 --> 22:52.600
I'm about to pick up
this phone

22:52.667 --> 22:54.333
and give you
another shot at them.

22:56.367 --> 22:57.567
I don't know
what to say.

22:59.067 --> 23:00.067
Rally.

23:07.133 --> 23:08.633
Goddamn it.

23:08.700 --> 23:09.900
Game, set, match.

23:11.200 --> 23:13.433
What can I say?
She's not just a pretty face.

23:13.500 --> 23:14.800
And neither is he.

23:16.200 --> 23:17.833
Jude's not
a self-promoter.

23:17.900 --> 23:20.433
What he is is a brilliant
strategist.

23:20.500 --> 23:22.633
Exactly who you want in
the team front office.

23:22.700 --> 23:25.333
A true strategist wins
no matter what their handicap.

23:26.500 --> 23:28.800
No offense, Zero,
but you suck at tennis.

23:31.367 --> 23:32.767
But...

23:32.833 --> 23:34.667
my father
taught me how to play,

23:34.733 --> 23:36.533
and he was nowhere near
as patient with me

23:36.600 --> 23:38.500
as you were with Zero.

23:38.567 --> 23:39.833
To me,
that means more.

23:39.900 --> 23:41.133
When it comes to
things I care about,

23:41.200 --> 23:42.600
I'm not reckless.

23:42.667 --> 23:45.300
Good, 'cause there's enough
of that coming from Lionel.

23:45.367 --> 23:47.400
Knowing you're
balancing her out...

23:47.467 --> 23:48.967
gonna help me sleep
a little sounder.

23:50.233 --> 23:51.567
You up for drink,

23:51.633 --> 23:53.267
talk me more
off this ledge?

23:53.333 --> 23:54.267
Yeah.

23:54.333 --> 23:56.133
All right,
well, let's go.

23:56.200 --> 23:58.933
All right, Maria Sharapova,
lessons start right now.

24:05.800 --> 24:07.133
Went straight for
the strong stuff.

24:08.467 --> 24:09.900
This German thing's
got me needing one too.

24:12.300 --> 24:13.667
How's Ahsha?
Bad.

24:15.400 --> 24:16.700
And I'm used to being able
to fix everything,

24:16.767 --> 24:19.400
but with this, all I can
do is stand by and watch.

24:21.967 --> 24:23.633
I'm not used to feeling
this powerless.

24:25.767 --> 24:26.700
Me either.

24:27.900 --> 24:29.733
I've never seen you on
the playground alone.

24:31.300 --> 24:32.567
No high rollers
on speed dial?

24:34.300 --> 24:36.133
Ah, right.

24:36.200 --> 24:37.467
Married life.

24:42.967 --> 24:43.967
Thanks for the chat.

24:52.833 --> 24:56.233
Jelena, I thought you said
that you were gonna...

24:56.300 --> 24:58.300
Ah, there's my girl.

24:58.367 --> 24:59.800
You had your chance.

24:59.867 --> 25:01.200
I have things
I need to say to you

25:01.267 --> 25:03.533
and you're not leaving
until I say them.

25:03.600 --> 25:05.767
Life is short
and I won't have any regrets.

25:05.833 --> 25:07.067
Jelena...

25:07.133 --> 25:08.533
Sit down, James.

25:12.367 --> 25:13.600
I owe you.

25:15.433 --> 25:17.067
It's not me
you owe this to.

25:32.333 --> 25:34.267
You don't need to worry about
talking about this

25:34.333 --> 25:35.700
but you will hear it.

25:39.400 --> 25:41.667
I am not your
little girl.

25:42.933 --> 25:44.067
I never was.

25:45.500 --> 25:47.067
I wasn't
raised by you.

25:47.133 --> 25:48.533
I survived you.

25:49.767 --> 25:50.967
Just because you didn't
lift a hand to me

25:51.067 --> 25:54.433
doesn't mean you didn't
terrorize me every day!

25:56.600 --> 25:59.133
You took my
childhood from me.

26:01.367 --> 26:03.633
You took my safety
from me.

26:06.333 --> 26:09.233
Worst of all,
you took my mother from me.

26:11.967 --> 26:13.933
Maybe you were
a different person back then,

26:14.067 --> 26:16.933
maybe she found a way to
save your soul...

26:18.600 --> 26:21.733
... but you are still
the villain of my life.

26:26.067 --> 26:28.100
You're going to have to live
with that the rest of yours

26:28.167 --> 26:29.567
because I refuse...

26:38.067 --> 26:39.800
This is the last
you'll ever see me.

26:46.167 --> 26:47.100
Can I talk to you?

27:03.700 --> 27:05.100
Jelena, I'm sorry.

27:05.167 --> 27:06.100
I wish that--

27:06.167 --> 27:07.067
You helped set this up

27:07.133 --> 27:09.533
but you didn't
try to intervene

27:09.600 --> 27:11.200
or make excuses
for him.

27:14.200 --> 27:16.233
You supported me like
a good mother would.

27:22.067 --> 27:24.200
Uh, I hope that...

27:24.267 --> 27:26.867
not being able to have
a relationship with him

27:26.933 --> 27:29.567
doesn't mean I can't have
a relationship with you.

27:32.500 --> 27:33.833
No, it doesn't.

27:35.167 --> 27:36.100
Good.

27:39.200 --> 27:40.233
Good.

27:46.100 --> 27:48.133
If you would just walk me
to him, you'll see.

27:49.667 --> 27:50.800
Hey.

27:50.867 --> 27:52.067
Your mom said
you were here.

27:52.100 --> 27:53.300
Are you okay?

27:53.367 --> 27:54.667
I don't care if
German hates me.

27:54.733 --> 27:56.067
I can't let him do this
to himself.

27:56.100 --> 27:57.100
I won't!

27:57.167 --> 27:58.867
You might wanna
get her out of here.

27:58.933 --> 28:01.533
Ahsha, come on,
let's go.

28:01.600 --> 28:02.733
No!

28:02.800 --> 28:04.600
German needs me!

28:04.667 --> 28:06.567
His sentencing
is tomorrow!

28:06.633 --> 28:08.633
He needs me
to get him to fight!

28:08.700 --> 28:10.067
He needs to know how hard
Chase Vincent

28:10.100 --> 28:11.567
is pushing
to have him punished!

28:11.633 --> 28:14.400
He needs me to tell him
not to throw his life away!

28:14.467 --> 28:15.533
Let me see him!

28:15.600 --> 28:16.667
Get her out of
here now!

28:16.733 --> 28:18.167
Now!
Come on, come on.

28:25.600 --> 28:26.733
I lost it.

28:28.500 --> 28:29.933
I was so
pissed back there.

28:30.067 --> 28:31.767
Yeah, you were a whole
bunch of things back there.

28:33.700 --> 28:35.867
Passionate...

28:35.933 --> 28:38.067
caring, and most
of all, loyal.

28:39.467 --> 28:40.667
You keep
getting knocked down

28:40.733 --> 28:42.933
but you won't stop
fighting for him.

28:43.067 --> 28:44.433
You've been
beating yourself up over

28:44.500 --> 28:45.933
what kind of person
you are.

28:46.067 --> 28:47.667
But the Ahsha Hayes I've
seen in the last few days

28:47.733 --> 28:49.733
is she's been impressive
as hell.

28:53.400 --> 28:54.700
You're not a good girl.

28:57.133 --> 28:58.833
But you're
a damn good person.

29:03.167 --> 29:04.400
You've been
so patient with me.

29:05.700 --> 29:07.667
I know German's not
your favorite.

29:07.733 --> 29:09.067
He and I weren't
gonna be friends

29:09.067 --> 29:10.400
with you
in the middle.

29:12.267 --> 29:14.167
But I respect how he always
looked out for you.

29:16.067 --> 29:18.067
Whatever happens at his
sentencing, it's not the end.

29:20.933 --> 29:23.067
I got the cash to help you
fight for him forever.

29:26.467 --> 29:27.767
You'd do that?

29:29.200 --> 29:30.833
You want me to
come with you tomorrow?

29:32.500 --> 29:33.900
No, you've
done enough.

29:56.333 --> 29:57.733
Marcus is gonna
meet with the board.

29:58.800 --> 30:00.533
Wifey came through.

30:00.600 --> 30:02.167
Wifey came through.

30:08.467 --> 30:09.700
Hey, I was...

30:09.767 --> 30:10.967
thinking maybe you could
kick me the number

30:11.033 --> 30:12.333
of that
private investigator.

30:13.700 --> 30:15.100
Yeah... sure.

30:26.467 --> 30:27.833
There she is.

30:27.900 --> 30:29.600
I got news.

30:29.667 --> 30:31.400
We have another chance
with the league,

30:31.467 --> 30:32.600
thanks to Sloane.

30:32.667 --> 30:33.967
Sloane?

30:34.033 --> 30:35.367
How'd you
pull that off?
She called me.

30:35.433 --> 30:37.833
Apparently, hatred for
Lionel supersedes all.

30:42.733 --> 30:43.933
What else
is going on?

30:46.100 --> 30:47.433
I saw my father again.

30:49.167 --> 30:50.100
And?

30:53.033 --> 30:54.933
And I didn't even
leave the bones.

31:00.133 --> 31:02.133
I made an appointment
with my OB/GYN.

31:03.533 --> 31:04.500
You did?

31:07.100 --> 31:09.833
I can't possibly be
a worse parent than he was.

31:12.667 --> 31:14.200
Besides...

31:14.267 --> 31:16.400
if all else fails,
the kid's got you.

31:17.833 --> 31:18.967
Right?

31:29.867 --> 31:31.067
Jude?

31:32.600 --> 31:33.533
Jude?

31:38.800 --> 31:40.467
Where's Jude?

31:40.533 --> 31:42.100
Jelena and Terrence have been
meeting with the league

31:42.167 --> 31:43.567
and Sloane Hayes
is walking them in

31:43.633 --> 31:45.567
on a red damn carpet.

31:45.633 --> 31:47.400
He's not here.

31:47.467 --> 31:49.300
Can you give me a little
more than "not here"?

31:57.300 --> 31:59.267
What were you and Jude
doing with Marcus Douglas

31:59.333 --> 32:01.767
at the Pacific Palisades
Country Club?

32:01.833 --> 32:03.333
We had a friendly
hit and giggle.

32:04.933 --> 32:06.933
Marcus doesn't do
anything for a giggle.

32:07.067 --> 32:08.967
Marcus needed some
breastfeeding.

32:09.067 --> 32:10.867
Jude wanted to make sure
that the board was cool.

32:12.233 --> 32:15.767
He talked board business
with Marcus without me?

32:15.833 --> 32:18.067
It's his business too.

32:18.100 --> 32:20.633
Okay, Jude was born
with the name Kinkade.

32:20.700 --> 32:22.200
You're borrowing it.

32:22.267 --> 32:23.833
And you haven't been
too careful with it lately.

32:24.967 --> 32:26.167
So I'd be thanking
the guy

32:26.233 --> 32:28.967
not only for
protecting his legacy...

32:29.067 --> 32:30.633
but protecting you.

32:30.700 --> 32:32.700
Jude's not
protecting me.

32:32.767 --> 32:34.800
He went there to vouch for me
because he didn't think

32:34.867 --> 32:36.233
I could
vouch for myself.

32:37.633 --> 32:38.867
Everyone's coming for me,

32:38.933 --> 32:41.267
and the one person I trust
doesn't trust me.

32:43.267 --> 32:44.567
You should
talk to Jude.

32:56.500 --> 32:57.833
The plans for the Devils
are impressive.

32:57.900 --> 32:59.367
Thank you.

32:59.433 --> 33:01.867
We would've heard them already
if Derek hadn't boxed you out

33:01.933 --> 33:03.900
and backed
Lionel so hard.

33:03.967 --> 33:05.600
What's changed?

33:05.667 --> 33:07.167
People make mistakes.

33:07.233 --> 33:09.200
The important thing
is owning them.

33:09.267 --> 33:11.933
To the Kinkades,
ball is business.

33:12.067 --> 33:15.367
Terrence bleeds for
the Devils.

33:15.433 --> 33:16.667
Literally.

33:16.733 --> 33:19.600
He sacrificed everything
out there on that court.

33:19.667 --> 33:21.300
That's who the fans wanna
see running this team.

33:23.067 --> 33:25.067
That's who I wanna
see running this team.

33:25.100 --> 33:26.200
We'll review your offer

33:26.267 --> 33:27.933
and take it into
serious consideration.

33:31.433 --> 33:32.400
Not good enough.

33:34.667 --> 33:36.067
We're not sitting by,

33:36.133 --> 33:37.600
waiting for Lionel to
burn the whole place down.

33:39.233 --> 33:41.933
With Derek, Sloane, and Pete,
we've got a full house.

33:42.067 --> 33:43.667
We own the house.

33:43.733 --> 33:44.800
If you think you
can find anyone

33:44.867 --> 33:46.367
better to run
the team, go for it.

33:50.300 --> 33:52.067
You've got 24 hours
to accept

33:52.067 --> 33:53.633
or we're
withdrawing our offer.

34:22.700 --> 34:23.733
This isn't real.

34:35.067 --> 34:36.267
Pete.

34:52.233 --> 34:53.400
What's burning?

34:55.500 --> 34:57.400
You can't think
I'm eating that.

34:57.467 --> 34:59.833
I know it's not
the prettiest.

34:59.900 --> 35:02.200
A head wound
isn't the prettiest.

35:05.900 --> 35:07.533
I wanna be here for you

35:07.600 --> 35:10.267
but all I'm good for is
hooking you up with dudes.

35:10.333 --> 35:12.633
That's not all
you're good for.

35:12.700 --> 35:15.533
You also got me to
cast dudes,

35:15.600 --> 35:18.067
go to San Diego
with a bartender dude,

35:18.100 --> 35:20.200
get my go-go on with
a dancer dude.

35:22.333 --> 35:23.900
That's kind of
a lot of things.

35:23.967 --> 35:25.567
It really is.

35:25.633 --> 35:28.100
Honestly, Kyle,
if it weren't for you,

35:28.167 --> 35:30.233
I wouldn't have done any
of the things I've done

35:30.300 --> 35:31.900
the last few months.

35:31.967 --> 35:34.333
You've pushed me
to take chances.

35:36.367 --> 35:37.767
I'm stronger
because of you.

35:39.167 --> 35:40.667
Strong enough to try
my frittata?

35:42.267 --> 35:43.567
Nobody's that strong.

35:45.933 --> 35:48.733
But... I am strong
enough to call Jesse.

35:51.367 --> 35:52.500
Hand me the phone.

36:11.467 --> 36:12.633
I'm sorry to
keep you waiting.

36:14.067 --> 36:17.533
So I reviewed all your
lab work very carefully...

36:19.533 --> 36:22.667
Jelena, your tests show
an ovulation

36:22.733 --> 36:24.633
and endometriosis.

36:24.700 --> 36:26.533
The combination suggests
that your ability

36:26.600 --> 36:28.733
to conceive
is challenged.

36:28.800 --> 36:30.067
How challenged?

36:30.067 --> 36:31.600
Well, there are
fertility pills

36:31.667 --> 36:34.500
and shots,
experimental procedures.

36:34.567 --> 36:36.733
But your endometriosis
is extensive.

36:36.800 --> 36:38.133
So the sooner
you start treatment--

36:38.200 --> 36:39.400
Be straight with me.

36:41.833 --> 36:44.733
It's unlikely...

36:44.800 --> 36:46.367
you'll ever be
able to have a child.

36:56.100 --> 36:57.233
Lionel was here.

36:57.300 --> 36:58.433
She figured out
we were with Marcus.

36:59.500 --> 37:01.067
Did you tell her
why we went?

37:01.067 --> 37:02.533
Didn't matter.

37:02.600 --> 37:03.933
She thinks you lost
faith in her.

37:06.800 --> 37:08.833
I'll smooth it
over tomorrow.

37:08.900 --> 37:10.667
It's true, isn't it?

37:14.333 --> 37:16.300
Yeah, it is.

37:16.367 --> 37:18.700
Then you're not gonna wanna
hear why she came by.

37:18.767 --> 37:21.133
Jelena and Terrence got
a meeting with the league,

37:21.200 --> 37:22.367
thanks to Sloane.

37:24.867 --> 37:26.633
And Lionel's out there
thinking she has no one.

37:28.633 --> 37:29.933
Well, what's
the worst she can do?

37:41.067 --> 37:43.700
Get lost on your way
to the makeup counter?

37:43.767 --> 37:46.300
Prison's really dulled what
limited wit you had.

37:48.133 --> 37:50.167
Must've been devastating

37:50.233 --> 37:51.367
when you thought Jude
tracked down

37:51.433 --> 37:52.733
your medical examiner.

37:55.367 --> 37:57.200
Turns out he did.

37:57.267 --> 37:58.500
You don't say.

38:00.100 --> 38:01.067
I snagged his number.

38:02.533 --> 38:03.900
Had a little chat
with the man.

38:05.533 --> 38:07.333
He recanted everything
on that recording.

38:08.500 --> 38:10.333
Without it, there's
no case against you.

38:13.500 --> 38:14.900
How did you
manage that?

38:17.267 --> 38:18.833
I can be very convincing.

38:21.833 --> 38:24.067
My seat at the arena
is being threatened.

38:25.733 --> 38:27.467
You're gonna help
make sure I keep it.

38:28.867 --> 38:32.467
But be clear, with what
I have over you,

38:32.533 --> 38:33.867
you're on
a very short leash.

38:56.933 --> 38:59.333
You've plead guilty
to manslaughter.

39:00.667 --> 39:02.100
Before I sentence,

39:02.167 --> 39:05.367
do you have anything to
say on your own behalf?

39:16.600 --> 39:18.067
I went there to
talk to Olivia.

39:20.100 --> 39:21.067
It got heated.

39:22.433 --> 39:24.600
I never meant for
what happened to happen.

39:26.200 --> 39:27.467
But it did.

39:29.500 --> 39:30.967
Nothing I can say
will make it right.

39:32.900 --> 39:35.533
I hurt people who will try like
hell to convince me otherwise...

39:37.133 --> 39:38.067
... but I couldn't let them.

39:46.867 --> 39:47.933
What I did...

39:49.200 --> 39:50.500
... I did for love.

39:53.167 --> 39:54.533
Love for Ahsha Hayes.

39:58.367 --> 39:59.667
No matter what...

40:00.867 --> 40:02.400
... I'm always
gonna love her.

40:04.567 --> 40:06.700
German Vega, in accordance

40:06.767 --> 40:08.700
with the laws of
California...

40:11.267 --> 40:14.233
... I sentence you
to 20 years

40:14.300 --> 40:15.667
in a state facility.

40:17.867 --> 40:19.400
It is ordered that
the sheriff

40:19.467 --> 40:20.900
escort the defendant

40:20.967 --> 40:24.033
to such a correctional
facility immediately.

40:30.267 --> 40:31.467
You killed my wife!

40:40.033 --> 40:41.600
Next time, on "Hit The Floor"...

40:41.667 --> 40:44.733
24-year-old male,
stab wound to the abdomen.

40:44.800 --> 40:46.133
German, I'm here.

40:47.633 --> 40:48.700
Hello, son.

40:48.767 --> 40:50.033
Are you crazy?

40:50.100 --> 40:51.933
What were you thinking
getting Oscar released?

40:52.000 --> 40:53.500
Your sister's
foster care record.

40:53.567 --> 40:55.333
She basically dropped
out of the system.

40:55.400 --> 40:57.067
You find people.

40:57.133 --> 40:58.067
Find her.

40:58.133 --> 40:59.433
You need
to be admitted.

40:59.500 --> 41:00.967
For how long?

41:01.067 --> 41:02.333
We aren't about to
play another round of

41:02.400 --> 41:04.233
musical chairs
for this team.

41:04.300 --> 41:06.533
The league needs to
make a decision now.

41:06.600 --> 41:08.067
Is it the Kinkades
or us?
