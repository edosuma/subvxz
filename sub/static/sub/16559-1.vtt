00:03.214 --> 00:04.335
Previously on "How To Get Away
With Murder"...

00:04.335 --> 00:05.386
-Stanford.
-I want you to come with me.

00:05.386 --> 00:07.548
This is, uh, Connor Walsh.

00:07.548 --> 00:09.550
I'm calling to say
that I won't be attending.

00:09.550 --> 00:10.841
I killed Lila.

00:10.841 --> 00:12.803
You did it for Sam.

00:12.803 --> 00:14.265
She can't know.

00:14.265 --> 00:16.807
Frank was just doing
what he was told.

00:16.807 --> 00:18.189
You want
to change your life,

00:18.189 --> 00:21.642
or are you happy just to stay
Annalise Keating's bitch?

00:23.984 --> 00:25.526
I'm sorry.

00:25.526 --> 00:27.358
I did this to him.
I did it.

00:27.358 --> 00:28.949
Sam.

00:28.949 --> 00:30.111
It was me.
I did this.

00:31.862 --> 00:33.114
She won't forgive herself.

00:33.114 --> 00:34.115
She can never know.

00:34.115 --> 00:35.326
It was Sam.

00:35.326 --> 00:37.328
It was the both of them.

00:37.328 --> 00:38.829
-Where is he?
-Annalise.

00:38.829 --> 00:40.291
He needs to go.

00:40.291 --> 00:42.253
Hello? Frank?

00:43.874 --> 00:44.875
My father -- he's dead.

00:44.875 --> 00:46.547
He's very much alive,

00:46.547 --> 00:48.719
and his name
is Wallace Mahoney.

00:48.719 --> 00:50.931
-I think I'm your son.
-Why would you think that?

00:50.931 --> 00:52.383
Annalise Keating --

01:03.394 --> 01:05.486
A little respect, please!

01:09.490 --> 01:12.693
I was just...
asking for directions.

01:12.693 --> 01:15.616
I don't live here.
I was a little lost.

01:15.616 --> 01:20.331
He just stepped out of
the office, so I stopped him.

01:20.331 --> 01:21.582
He seemed angry --

01:21.582 --> 01:24.335
Because you interrupted
a phone call he was on?

01:24.335 --> 01:25.666
Yeah.

01:25.666 --> 01:27.668
And the person on the other end,
when we speak with them,

01:27.668 --> 01:30.471
they'll verify you were
just asking for directions?

01:32.173 --> 01:33.554
'Course.

01:49.940 --> 01:51.942
Thanks for --
Quiet.

01:51.942 --> 01:53.033
Not here.

02:02.833 --> 02:05.546
Tell me
exactly what he said.

02:07.508 --> 02:08.549
He was on the phone --

02:08.549 --> 02:09.420
Not your father.

02:11.462 --> 02:12.843
Frank.

02:27.398 --> 02:29.530
Want to go
finally meet your dad?

02:32.323 --> 02:34.034
That's his office.

02:35.576 --> 02:37.077
You sure?

02:37.077 --> 02:40.541
He's your friggin' father.
You have a right to meet him.

02:40.541 --> 02:41.912
Yeah, but Annalise
made me promise --

02:41.912 --> 02:43.454
It was her idea.

02:43.454 --> 02:47.127
She knows you,
how nosy you are.

02:47.127 --> 02:49.460
But...if you want
to call her,

02:49.460 --> 02:50.751
make sure
she's down with this...

02:50.751 --> 02:51.962
Don't.

02:53.504 --> 02:56.006
You're just gonna say hi.
That's all.

02:56.006 --> 02:58.929
And I'm here for backup
in case things get out of hand.

03:01.472 --> 03:04.225
Tell me how
we explain that to anyone.

03:04.225 --> 03:08.519
No, the minute I show up,
gossip starts, and then this --

03:08.519 --> 03:10.070
What --
What we've been doing,

03:10.070 --> 03:13.113
that's all anyone
is gonna talk about.

03:13.113 --> 03:14.365
Hold on a second.

03:14.365 --> 03:15.486
Can I help you?

03:15.486 --> 03:17.868
I think I'm your son.

03:17.868 --> 03:19.990
Why would you
think that?

03:19.990 --> 03:20.991
Annalise Keating --

03:27.458 --> 03:31.091
I would've run, but the driver
was parked right there.

03:31.091 --> 03:33.294
And I looked for Frank,
but his car was gone.

03:35.045 --> 03:37.097
I'm so sorry, Wes.

03:38.259 --> 03:39.470
For what?

03:39.470 --> 03:40.681
Frank.

03:42.102 --> 03:44.265
He did this for me.

03:44.265 --> 03:45.896
You asked him
to shoot my father?

03:45.896 --> 03:47.518
No.
Then how is this
for you?

03:47.518 --> 03:49.149
Listen to me, okay?

03:49.149 --> 03:51.021
Just listen.

03:51.021 --> 03:52.613
Your father hurt me,
too.

03:54.695 --> 03:57.358
In the worst way.

03:57.358 --> 03:59.360
I didn't know,

03:59.360 --> 04:02.663
because Frank hid it from me
for years.

04:02.663 --> 04:06.997
Tonight was his way
of making things right.

04:06.997 --> 04:09.460
How does this
make anything right?
It doesn't.

04:09.460 --> 04:12.212
He took me there on purpose,
told me it was your idea.

04:12.212 --> 04:14.254
Because he's using you
against me.

04:16.587 --> 04:19.089
And he knows
that I can hurt him.

04:19.089 --> 04:21.882
But I can't now,
can I?

04:21.882 --> 04:26.307
Not when he could go
to the police with the truth --

04:26.307 --> 04:29.099
that you're actually
Wallace Mahoney's son.

04:36.697 --> 04:37.488
Get out.

04:49.119 --> 04:52.543
Your father's dead.
Frank did that.

04:52.543 --> 04:54.625
And neither of these men
are --

04:54.625 --> 04:57.878
are worth
losing ourselves over.

04:57.878 --> 05:01.802
They're gone for good,
and we need to let them go.

Hey, stranger.

06:16.256 --> 06:17.087
Hey.

06:18.919 --> 06:20.551
When did you
get back in town?

06:20.551 --> 06:24.264
A week ago --
when I texted you.

06:24.264 --> 06:26.346
Right. Sorry.

06:26.346 --> 06:28.218
I went with Maggie
up to her parents' cabin.

06:28.218 --> 06:29.600
There wasn't
really reception.

06:29.600 --> 06:31.221
You met Maggie's parents
already?

06:31.221 --> 06:33.814
No, it was
just the two of us.

06:33.814 --> 06:35.315
Nice!

06:35.315 --> 06:36.607
Yeah.

06:36.607 --> 06:37.938
Yeah.

06:39.570 --> 06:42.152
First day.
Can't be late.

06:46.577 --> 06:48.158
Homies, over here.

06:50.621 --> 06:54.745
Mr. C8, Miss A8.
It's your new seats.

06:54.745 --> 06:56.747
I got here early to
make sure we weren't
sat next to some weenball.

06:56.747 --> 06:58.128
He doesn't realize
that's him.

06:58.128 --> 07:00.040
Oh, please tell me
I'm in the back somewhere.

07:00.040 --> 07:02.132
I need to catch up
on my sleep.

07:02.132 --> 07:05.596
No -- B4. But the good news is,
I'm right behind you.

07:05.596 --> 07:07.217
Well, of course
you're all here.

07:07.217 --> 07:08.469
Why wouldn't we
be here?

07:08.469 --> 07:11.261
Well, we've all
seen the rankings.

07:11.261 --> 07:12.853
You think there's any way
you'd all be in this class

07:12.853 --> 07:14.314
if Keating
wasn't teaching it?

07:14.314 --> 07:15.726
-Excuse me?
-That's aggressive.
-Who are you?

07:15.726 --> 07:17.317
Sers, bro, you want
to step to us like that

07:17.317 --> 07:18.689
and class
hasn't even begun yet?

07:18.689 --> 07:20.731
Actually, I'm just trying
to step to my seat.

07:20.731 --> 07:22.563
Congratulations.

07:22.563 --> 07:24.735
You've each been hand-chosen
to take part

07:24.735 --> 07:28.118
in my very first
criminal law legal clinic.

07:28.118 --> 07:31.742
In here,
you're not just students,

07:31.742 --> 07:33.574
but actual practicing lawyers,

07:33.574 --> 07:37.998
responsible for your own cases
and clients.

07:37.998 --> 07:40.501
You finally get to be me.

08:07.528 --> 08:10.110
Someone is clearly upset I
didn't pick them for this class.

08:13.073 --> 08:15.956
This clinic is pro bono.

08:15.956 --> 08:19.379
We only represent people who
can't afford their own lawyers.

08:19.379 --> 08:21.792
You will each compete
to become first chair.

08:21.792 --> 08:24.464
Some of you will end up
defending several clients,

08:24.464 --> 08:26.927
while the lamer of you
will never step foot

08:26.927 --> 08:28.929
in front of a judge.

08:28.929 --> 08:31.722
Now, who will that be?

08:31.722 --> 08:33.223
Let's start.

08:33.223 --> 08:36.807
Karim Assaf --
a refugee from Iraq

08:36.807 --> 08:39.059
who came here 10 years ago
with his two children.

08:39.059 --> 08:40.480
Cut to a year ago.

08:40.480 --> 08:42.773
Karim is driving
his two children to school.

08:42.773 --> 08:47.487
The police stop him and find
over 2 ounces of marijuana.

08:47.487 --> 08:49.820
Karim pleads guilty
to possession

08:49.820 --> 08:53.153
with the intent to distribute
and serves 12 months,

08:53.153 --> 08:55.866
and now he faces
additional legal trouble.

08:55.866 --> 08:58.619
What could that be...

08:58.619 --> 09:01.541
Ms. Leibowitz?

09:01.541 --> 09:04.124
An intent to distribute would
make him subject to deportation.

09:04.124 --> 09:05.716
Well, Karim has
a green card.

09:05.716 --> 09:07.878
Shouldn't that allow him
to stay in the U.S.?

09:07.878 --> 09:09.379
Mr. Montgomery.

09:09.379 --> 09:10.470
Um, no.

09:10.470 --> 09:12.222
The court doesn't look
at deportation

09:12.222 --> 09:13.884
as an additional form
of punishment.

09:13.884 --> 09:17.097
What Supreme Court decision
is Mr. Montgomery referencing?

09:17.097 --> 09:19.059
Uh, Ms. Pratt.

09:22.392 --> 09:23.854
I don't know.

09:23.854 --> 09:25.065
Surprise, surprise.

09:27.147 --> 09:29.319
Care to back up
that smack talk, Mr. Drake?

09:31.491 --> 09:35.115
The Supreme Court case
Fong Yue Ting v. United States,

09:35.115 --> 09:36.657
decided 1893.

09:36.657 --> 09:40.661
Justice Horace Gray
delivered the plurality opinion.

09:40.661 --> 09:42.412
Show-off.

09:42.412 --> 09:45.756
All right, tomorrow,
each of you will get a chance

09:45.756 --> 09:48.588
to present a defense that keeps
Karim in this country.

09:48.588 --> 09:51.091
Now, I'll pick two of you
for first and second chair.

09:51.091 --> 09:52.713
But be careful.

09:52.713 --> 09:55.806
Winning means that you carry
the fate of this entire family

09:55.806 --> 09:58.218
in your hands.

10:01.221 --> 10:03.393
And you wonder why
people think I favor you?

10:03.393 --> 10:05.605
Wait. You aren't
at all concerned?

10:05.605 --> 10:07.067
About what?

10:07.067 --> 10:08.568
The flier.
It's a piece of paper.

10:08.568 --> 10:09.900
That says "killer"
on it.

10:09.900 --> 10:11.692
I've been called worse.

10:18.368 --> 10:21.241
Everything's fine.
The police have moved on.

10:21.241 --> 10:22.743
Nothing bad's happened
all summer --

10:22.743 --> 10:23.794
Like that means
anything.

10:23.794 --> 10:25.455
It means we're safe.

10:25.455 --> 10:28.168
And you want to know why?
We're good people now.

10:30.010 --> 10:32.302
Say it to yourself
until you believe it.

10:38.468 --> 10:40.640
Ray Fonseca
fired his lawyer.

10:40.640 --> 10:42.222
They're holding him
on extortion and bribery.

10:42.222 --> 10:44.394
He's a gang leader,
Bonnie.

10:44.394 --> 10:46.566
A gang leader
with a lot of money.
Stop it.

10:46.566 --> 10:49.820
This is hard enough without you
dangling carrots in my face.

11:53.423 --> 11:54.464
Hi.

11:55.505 --> 11:56.927
Hi.

11:56.927 --> 12:01.261
I just came to say that I'm
going to Mexico for the summer.

12:01.261 --> 12:03.603
I thought your father
couldn't go back to Mexico.

12:03.603 --> 12:05.435
He can't.
I'm visiting my mom.

12:05.435 --> 12:07.938
Mm.

12:07.938 --> 12:09.980
And Frank?

12:09.980 --> 12:11.611
Will he be there, too?

12:15.115 --> 12:16.236
He left me, too,
you know.

12:18.278 --> 12:19.659
Do I know?

12:19.659 --> 12:21.992
You were the one I called
when I realized he was missing.

12:21.992 --> 12:23.243
You mean when his bitch-ass
ran away.

12:23.243 --> 12:24.414
Which I knew
nothing about.

12:24.414 --> 12:26.036
And is that what
you honestly think of me --

12:26.036 --> 12:27.457
that I'd be okay
with what he did to Wes?

12:27.457 --> 12:29.369
Quiet!

12:29.369 --> 12:31.541
I've been on your side
the entire time,

12:31.541 --> 12:32.963
helping you
every time you asked me,

12:32.963 --> 12:33.964
so I don't deserve this.

12:33.964 --> 12:35.836
Be angry at Frank.

12:35.836 --> 12:37.878
Just do not
be angry at me.

12:37.878 --> 12:41.681
There's no gray area here,
Laurel.

12:41.681 --> 12:44.094
It's him or it's me.

12:46.516 --> 12:48.228
He's dead to me.

12:50.440 --> 12:51.812
Good.

12:53.523 --> 12:56.026
Bring me back
some tequila.

12:56.026 --> 12:58.358
My body's sick
of vodka.

13:18.718 --> 13:20.050
It's Frank.
Leave a message.

13:21.471 --> 13:23.263
Your mailbox isn't full,
so I know that means

13:23.263 --> 13:26.096
you're checking your messages
and not dead somewhere.

13:26.096 --> 13:28.058
I just wanted to say...

13:31.982 --> 13:33.563
I hate you.

13:39.319 --> 13:40.700
Do you mind
if we record this

13:40.700 --> 13:42.943
so that Professor Keating
can monitor what we say?

13:46.706 --> 13:50.000
Your daughter Faiza believes you
were the victim of profiling.

13:50.000 --> 13:51.791
That's not true.
Are you sure?

13:51.791 --> 13:52.873
'Cause if we can convince
the judge

13:52.873 --> 13:54.084
there was discrimination
in your case --

13:54.084 --> 13:55.215
I refuse to play
that card.

13:55.215 --> 13:56.716
Even if it makes
a convincing story?

13:56.716 --> 13:57.797
Turn off the recording.

13:57.797 --> 13:59.049
We need to use
every advantage we have --

13:59.049 --> 14:01.671
Turn it off,
and I'll explain.

14:03.223 --> 14:06.556
Our client already pled guilty.
We all know that.

14:06.556 --> 14:09.269
So I suggest we have Karim
say just three simple words

14:09.269 --> 14:13.063
to the judge --
"I am sorry."

14:13.063 --> 14:15.685
Any excuse or denial
will only serve to hurt him,

14:15.685 --> 14:18.238
whereas remorse will show
that he has learned his lesson

14:18.238 --> 14:20.150
and is ready
to return to society

14:20.150 --> 14:21.861
as a fully rehabilitated
citizen.

14:21.861 --> 14:22.983
Well done, Mr. Drake.

14:22.983 --> 14:25.115
That's his big idea?
An apology? Weenball.

14:25.115 --> 14:25.986
Mr. Millstone.

14:28.618 --> 14:30.450
Uh...

14:30.450 --> 14:33.543
Well, because it's immigration
court and there's no jury, uh,

14:33.543 --> 14:36.376
my idea is to target
the personality of the judge.

14:36.376 --> 14:38.378
And provide a reason
why Karim would purchase

14:38.378 --> 14:39.209
that much marijuana.

14:39.209 --> 14:39.920
For example...

14:39.920 --> 14:41.421
We could apply for asylum,

14:41.421 --> 14:43.343
argue that we don't know
the new dangers

14:43.343 --> 14:44.925
that he could face
back in Iraq...

14:44.925 --> 14:47.307
...where he could work
as an informant to the FBI,

14:47.307 --> 14:50.310
trading information on radical
members of his community,

14:50.310 --> 14:51.811
which would then allow us
to revisit...

14:51.811 --> 14:53.143
...the judge's office,

14:53.143 --> 14:55.015
and while her clerk
wasn't exactly forthcoming,

14:55.015 --> 14:56.606
I did find out
that she's a grandmother.

14:56.606 --> 14:58.358
We could hit home the idea
that his life

14:58.358 --> 15:00.280
is more valuable here
than in Iraq,

15:00.280 --> 15:02.192
thereby persuading the judge
to order...

15:02.192 --> 15:05.025
A stay of removal is the best
thing for all parties involved.

15:05.025 --> 15:07.487
This will allow us time
to delay and prove...

15:07.487 --> 15:09.699
Smoking marijuana helps
with symptoms of PTSD,

15:09.699 --> 15:11.741
so even though Karim's test
came back negative,

15:11.741 --> 15:12.492
we could argue...

15:12.492 --> 15:13.663
...an expungement or...

15:13.663 --> 15:15.535
...appeal to the judge's
maternal instincts.

15:15.535 --> 15:16.916
And while this wouldn't
be helpful in most cases,

15:16.916 --> 15:18.878
with immigration court,

15:18.878 --> 15:20.590
the decisions are often left
to the judge's discretion --

15:20.590 --> 15:21.501
Professor Keating!

15:21.501 --> 15:22.712
Excuse me.
I'm in the middle of --

15:22.712 --> 15:24.464
The pot wasn't Karim's.

15:24.464 --> 15:26.046
It was his daughter's.

15:26.046 --> 15:29.009
He didn't know she was dealing
until the cop found the drugs,

15:29.009 --> 15:32.262
so then he said they were his
in order to protect her.

15:32.262 --> 15:34.394
What do you suggest we do
with that information?

15:34.394 --> 15:36.016
We could go
to the original prosecutor

15:36.016 --> 15:38.188
and explain that he was just
being a good father.

15:38.188 --> 15:40.520
So they deport his daughter
instead?

15:40.520 --> 15:43.323
No, she hasn't been in Iraq
since she was 6.

15:43.323 --> 15:45.405
Do you think our immigration
courts really care?

15:45.405 --> 15:47.327
You're out,
Ms. Castillo.
What?

15:47.327 --> 15:49.449
Mr. Gibbins,
you're last up.

15:49.449 --> 15:50.330
I didn't finish.

15:50.330 --> 15:51.411
You're out, too.

15:51.411 --> 15:53.413
Impress me.

15:53.413 --> 15:55.535
Research shows
hearing from family and friends

15:55.535 --> 15:58.999
is the most effective tactic
to evade deportation.

15:58.999 --> 16:02.252
Knowing this, I talked to about
a dozen of Karim's friends,

16:02.252 --> 16:04.714
neighbors,
even his imam at the mosque,

16:04.714 --> 16:07.387
and they all agreed to testify
as character witnesses.

16:07.387 --> 16:10.350
Finally -- a practical strategy
we can use in court.

16:10.350 --> 16:12.182
Mr. Gibbins,
you're first chair.

16:12.182 --> 16:13.893
Mr. Drake,
you're his second.

16:13.893 --> 16:16.056
The rest of you,
do better.

16:18.898 --> 16:20.860
Professor Keating?

16:20.860 --> 16:23.733
I didn't pick you because
your mom was an immigrant.

16:23.733 --> 16:25.315
I know.

16:25.315 --> 16:26.946
I just wanted to talk to you
about my opening statement.

16:26.946 --> 16:28.238
I have a draft here.

16:28.238 --> 16:29.409
You wrote an opening
for a case

16:29.409 --> 16:30.870
you hadn't been
assigned to yet?

16:30.870 --> 16:32.322
I had a good feeling.

16:34.244 --> 16:35.785
Why are you
always stalking me?

16:42.332 --> 16:44.124
Well, at least
they chose a good photo.

17:15.655 --> 17:16.826
You want to get in?

17:18.037 --> 17:19.329
Sure.

17:25.085 --> 17:27.507
Oh! Feels good.

17:27.507 --> 17:29.429
Right?

17:32.262 --> 17:34.174
You haven't returned
my calls.

17:35.935 --> 17:39.229
I'm just trying
to disconnect.

17:39.229 --> 17:41.441
Be happy or something.

17:41.441 --> 17:43.733
I get that.

17:44.734 --> 17:47.447
Look...

17:47.447 --> 17:49.949
I think Oliver's
going to ask you for a job.

17:49.949 --> 17:51.691
I need you to promise me
that you'll say no.

17:53.653 --> 17:56.746
I haven't asked for much --
I mean, anything, really --

17:56.746 --> 17:58.748
Oliver's never coming
to work for me.

17:58.748 --> 18:01.201
You swear?

18:01.201 --> 18:03.123
Because he'll, uh,
he'll find things out.

18:03.123 --> 18:04.964
We'd ruin him.

18:04.964 --> 18:07.257
Yeah, exactly.

18:07.257 --> 18:10.880
He'd become
the new Asher.

18:10.880 --> 18:13.213
I won't let that happen.

18:15.014 --> 18:16.136
You have my word.

18:28.778 --> 18:31.321
I could encrypt the firm's
files, update your firewalls.

18:31.321 --> 18:33.493
That way, no one like me
could hack you.

18:33.493 --> 18:35.155
Because I totally could.

18:35.155 --> 18:36.496
Not that I have.
I haven't.

18:36.496 --> 18:39.038
Uh...so don't worry,
but...

18:39.038 --> 18:40.160
you're very vulnerable.

18:41.831 --> 18:42.872
Here's my proposal.

18:45.084 --> 18:49.629
Also, the thing that I really
wanted to tell you is...

18:49.629 --> 18:52.512
I admire you.

18:52.512 --> 18:54.424
And I know what other people say
about you, but --

18:54.424 --> 18:55.885
What do they say?

18:55.885 --> 18:59.719
No, not about you
specifically, but, um...

18:59.719 --> 19:01.891
defense attorneys.

19:01.891 --> 19:04.143
I think it's so unfair.

19:04.143 --> 19:05.605
Because what I see you do

19:05.605 --> 19:08.648
is help people
who can't help themselves.

19:10.570 --> 19:13.193
I want to be
a part of that.

19:13.193 --> 19:15.535
I'm not hiring anyone
right now.

19:17.907 --> 19:19.909
I deleted
Connor's Stanford acceptance.

19:23.833 --> 19:26.666
I knew they might call, too,
or send a follow-up e-mail,

19:26.666 --> 19:31.000
so I hacked their system
and had those re-routed to me.

19:32.632 --> 19:33.883
He doesn't know.

19:33.883 --> 19:35.425
But you're telling me?

19:38.218 --> 19:39.969
I know
what you do here.

19:43.182 --> 19:47.437
That it's not always...
good.

19:47.437 --> 19:50.730
So I just wanted to be
very clear with you.

19:50.730 --> 19:52.482
I can be bad, too.

19:55.905 --> 19:57.317
Who wants another mojito?

19:57.317 --> 19:58.738
Oh, keep 'em comin'.
Yas, queen!

19:58.738 --> 20:00.199
None for me.

20:00.199 --> 20:01.741
Ooh, because you're pregnant
with Frank's baby?

20:01.741 --> 20:03.743
No, because I am trying
to be a good student.

20:03.743 --> 20:05.084
Boring!

20:05.084 --> 20:08.127
I...didn't know
we were having a party.

20:08.127 --> 20:10.380
Hey, Oli!

20:10.380 --> 20:11.461
Where were you?

20:11.461 --> 20:13.212
Oh, I went for a walk
in the park.

20:13.212 --> 20:14.834
Hashtag unemployment.

20:14.834 --> 20:17.046
Dawg, that makes it sound like
you were cruising for the D.

20:17.046 --> 20:19.639
So, how was
everybody's summer?

20:19.639 --> 20:22.432
Any new significant others,
besides Wes' little lady?

20:22.432 --> 20:23.803
Not me.

20:23.803 --> 20:25.765
Ask Laurel.
She's single again.

20:25.765 --> 20:27.557
You still haven't heard
from Frank?

20:27.557 --> 20:29.399
Nope.
I bet he's living
in South America,

20:29.399 --> 20:32.442
just off the fat of the land,
whacking bush.

20:32.442 --> 20:34.233
God,
I miss that beard.

20:34.233 --> 20:35.695
I don't.

20:37.857 --> 20:39.198
I should go.

20:39.198 --> 20:40.450
Going to get it in
with Meggy Weggy?

20:40.450 --> 20:42.071
That's not her actual name,
right?

20:42.071 --> 20:44.203
It's Megan or Margaret.

20:44.203 --> 20:46.826
I'm gonna go work
on Karim's case.

20:46.826 --> 20:49.579
Who chooses
to call themselves Meggy?

20:53.373 --> 20:54.714
Am I hitting the spot?

20:54.714 --> 20:56.336
Oh, God, yes.

21:00.680 --> 21:04.474
Someone put up a flier of me
on campus.

21:04.474 --> 21:06.596
It said "killer."

21:07.687 --> 21:09.649
Don't worry.

21:09.649 --> 21:12.151
It's probably just some student
whose feelings I hurt.

21:12.151 --> 21:13.523
You tell
the new president?

21:13.523 --> 21:15.234
So she has reason
to be up my ass again?

21:15.234 --> 21:16.776
No.

21:21.321 --> 21:22.702
It's harassment,
Annalise.

21:22.702 --> 21:24.163
I knew
I shouldn't have told you.

21:24.163 --> 21:26.075
All I'm saying is,

21:26.075 --> 21:28.207
whoever did this
could be unstable.

21:28.207 --> 21:30.460
I'm unstable.

21:30.460 --> 21:33.673
Maybe they need to be
protected from me.

21:38.548 --> 21:39.679
Your turn.

21:41.591 --> 21:43.473
I said roll over.

21:49.849 --> 21:52.101
Mmm.

21:52.101 --> 21:54.644
Oh, my God,
that feels good.

22:07.577 --> 22:09.709
Sorry to barge in.
What now?

22:09.709 --> 22:12.001
Well, you know how I'm not
really talking to my mom?

22:12.001 --> 22:14.003
Uh, well, that means I'm not
getting any support from her,

22:14.003 --> 22:18.257
uh, financially, and with
next year's tuition due...

22:18.257 --> 22:19.959
I need a loan,
basically.

22:21.551 --> 22:22.762
You think I'm joking?

22:22.762 --> 22:24.384
No. I think
you're serious.

22:24.384 --> 22:26.636
Please, Annalise,
I'm really struggling here.

22:26.636 --> 22:29.639
Yeah, because your white ass
has struggled a day in its life.

22:29.639 --> 22:32.522
Okay, my white ass is only
in this position because of you.

22:33.773 --> 22:35.475
Excuse me?

22:35.475 --> 22:37.356
My dad was perfectly happy
to pay my way,

22:37.356 --> 22:39.479
but now he's dead
because I chose you over him.

22:39.479 --> 22:41.481
Well, that's your version
of the truth, not mine.

22:41.481 --> 22:43.743
You need some money?
Get a job, like everyone else.

22:46.195 --> 22:47.326
Jerk.

22:49.829 --> 22:51.330
I should've looked into
Karim's public defender,

22:51.330 --> 22:53.372
argued ineffective assistance
of counsel.

22:53.372 --> 22:55.334
My perfect breasts
are in your face,

22:55.334 --> 22:56.796
and you want to talk
about the case?

22:56.796 --> 22:58.377
Right. Stay put.

22:58.377 --> 23:00.420
We got options.

23:00.420 --> 23:02.301
Ooh.

23:02.301 --> 23:03.883
Ooh.

23:03.883 --> 23:05.765
The Extender --
not that I need it.

23:05.765 --> 23:06.926
Are those from the bowl
in the hallway?

23:06.926 --> 23:08.307
Just one of the perks
of the new crib.

23:08.307 --> 23:10.139
Asher!
Are you in there?

23:10.139 --> 23:11.350
Ignore her.

23:11.350 --> 23:13.012
Sorry.
I'm on duty.

23:15.354 --> 23:16.776
Miladies.
Show him.

23:16.776 --> 23:19.689
Eh! If it's a rash, you go
to the infirmary for that.

23:19.689 --> 23:22.321
Chad texted her back, but she
doesn't know what it means.

23:22.321 --> 23:24.153
It means
he's over me, right?

23:24.153 --> 23:25.445
Look, we're gonna have to have
a conversation later

23:25.445 --> 23:27.286
about...
having conversations.

23:27.286 --> 23:29.078
But now I need you
to peer-process this.

23:32.121 --> 23:34.163
Hey, what are you doing?
Get naked!

23:34.163 --> 23:35.705
I'm a grown-ass woman.

23:35.705 --> 23:37.537
I can't be having sex
in dorm rooms.

23:37.537 --> 23:38.708
Uh, of course you can.

23:38.708 --> 23:39.999
Otherwise, you're just
discriminating against me

23:39.999 --> 23:41.250
'cause I'm poor now.

23:41.250 --> 23:42.922
Welcome to America.

23:54.974 --> 23:57.016
Don't worry.
You can't mess this up.

23:57.016 --> 23:59.689
Because
there's no way to win.

23:59.689 --> 24:03.022
The defense only wins 3%
of the cases in this court,

24:03.022 --> 24:07.827
which means you literally
have nothing to lose.

24:07.827 --> 24:09.989
Just try to enjoy it.

24:13.833 --> 24:16.666
Karim Assaf
is a good man --

24:16.666 --> 24:20.540
a dedicated father,
a kind neighbor.

24:20.540 --> 24:22.041
He steps up
when help is needed...

24:22.041 --> 24:24.463
This is so corny.
Poor Karim.

24:24.463 --> 24:25.585
Poor Karim's children.

24:25.585 --> 24:27.637
He is a leader
in his community.

24:27.637 --> 24:29.849
But you don't have to take
my word for it.

24:29.849 --> 24:31.891
Take theirs.

24:31.891 --> 24:33.973
The 15 people
who've come to attest

24:33.973 --> 24:36.145
to the upstanding character
of my client.

24:36.145 --> 24:38.057
Okay,
he's kind of killing it.

24:38.057 --> 24:40.650
Each person you see here
has their own story

24:40.650 --> 24:45.154
of his selflessness,
generosity, good citizenship,

24:45.154 --> 24:47.486
and, above all,
his integrity.

24:47.486 --> 24:48.908
She's so predictable.

24:48.908 --> 24:50.489
What?

24:50.489 --> 24:52.071
I know how to win.

24:53.452 --> 24:55.284
I was thinking
about the drug charge,

24:55.284 --> 24:57.206
how if we could prove
Karim's public defender

24:57.206 --> 24:58.998
provided ineffective assistance
of counsel --

24:58.998 --> 25:00.540
Hey,
that was my idea.

25:00.540 --> 25:02.211
Except you didn't go
to the public defender

25:02.211 --> 25:04.083
to record him
saying this.

25:04.083 --> 25:05.755
Did you or did you not
tell your client

25:05.755 --> 25:07.587
that pleading guilty
would cost him his green card?

25:07.587 --> 25:09.088
I'm saying I don't know!

25:09.088 --> 25:10.509
He doesn't remember.

25:10.509 --> 25:12.682
But Padilla v. Kentucky
says defense attorneys

25:12.682 --> 25:14.844
must advise clients
about risks of deportation

25:14.844 --> 25:16.055
when pleading guilty.

25:16.055 --> 25:17.847
Mr. Drake, you're out.
What?!

25:17.847 --> 25:20.019
Ms. Pratt just turned this case
on its head.

25:20.019 --> 25:22.021
Bonnie, you take my place.
Mr. Walsh, with me.

25:22.021 --> 25:23.522
You two, stall.

25:26.736 --> 25:29.699
I'd like to call the defense's
first witness to the stand --

25:29.699 --> 25:33.653
Mr. Nasim Darwish,
our client's imam at his mosque.

25:33.653 --> 25:35.575
You just give the name,
young lady -- no biography.

25:35.575 --> 25:37.036
Sorry.

25:37.036 --> 25:38.658
Did you or did you not
tell your client

25:38.658 --> 25:40.209
that pleading guilty
would cost him his green card?

25:40.209 --> 25:42.501
I'm saying I don't know!

25:42.501 --> 25:44.123
Sign the motion to vacate,
I'll be out of your hair.

25:44.123 --> 25:45.424
He said,
"I don't know."

25:45.424 --> 25:46.626
That doesn't mean
he didn't tell your client.

25:46.626 --> 25:48.337
Doesn't mean he did,
either.

25:48.337 --> 25:49.879
I need my boss
to sign off on it.

25:49.879 --> 25:53.512
And let's face it, Annalise --
he's not about to help you

25:53.512 --> 25:56.015
after all the crap
you put us through this year.

25:56.015 --> 25:58.517
And what does Mr. Assaf do
at your hardware store?

25:58.517 --> 26:00.640
He's our
stockroom manager.

26:00.640 --> 26:03.733
And just what
does that job entail?

26:03.733 --> 26:07.356
Uh...taking care
of the stockroom.

26:07.356 --> 26:09.108
The defense calls
Myriam Mahmoud-Faizan

26:09.108 --> 26:10.359
to the stand.

26:10.359 --> 26:12.612
-Carol Lunn.
-Jodie Mayer.

26:12.612 --> 26:14.363
-Khalid El Baur.
-Ashley Chang.

26:14.363 --> 26:15.655
-Owen Marconi.
-Katrina Barberi.

26:15.655 --> 26:16.535
-Makram Azia.
-Gina Brown.

26:16.535 --> 26:17.196
-Faraj Shah.
-Steven Mason.

26:17.196 --> 26:18.497
-Jamal Ibrahim.

26:18.497 --> 26:19.659
This is what we'll do.

26:19.659 --> 26:21.701
Drop the original charge
to possession only.

26:21.701 --> 26:24.203
You get your guilty plea,
but it's a misdemeanor now.

26:24.203 --> 26:26.465
That way, my client has a chance
of remaining with his family.

26:26.465 --> 26:27.837
Everyone wins.

26:27.837 --> 26:29.258
What about the daughter?

26:29.258 --> 26:30.800
I can make her cry
on the stand.

26:30.800 --> 26:32.421
Or she'll end up
telling the truth.

26:34.213 --> 26:36.636
Ms. Winterbottom,
either call your next witness

26:36.636 --> 26:38.718
or I'm making my decision.

26:43.062 --> 26:45.184
We'd like to call
Faiza Assaf, Your Honor.

26:46.225 --> 26:48.067
I told Annalise
she can't testify.

26:48.067 --> 26:49.528
It'll buy us time.

26:51.731 --> 26:53.863
Do you swear to tell
the truth, the whole truth,

26:53.863 --> 26:55.534
and nothing
but the truth?

26:55.534 --> 26:57.536
I do.

26:57.536 --> 26:59.699
Your Honor, I have a new plea
to present to the court.

26:59.699 --> 27:01.000
Approach.

27:01.000 --> 27:03.542
This reduces Mr. Assaf's felony
to a misdemeanor,

27:03.542 --> 27:06.165
which makes him eligible
to remain in the country.

27:06.165 --> 27:08.297
I move
for his immediate release.

27:08.297 --> 27:10.249
Your Honor,
Mr. Assaf pled guilty

27:10.249 --> 27:11.590
to this charge
months ago.

27:11.590 --> 27:13.963
Let's take a recess,
and I'll give my decision after.

27:15.845 --> 27:17.016
Mr. Walsh.

27:20.179 --> 27:21.310
We're gonna win this thing,
right?

27:21.310 --> 27:22.431
Who the hell knows?

27:22.431 --> 27:24.894
We need to talk
about your boyfriend.

27:24.894 --> 27:25.765
Why?

27:25.765 --> 27:27.226
I'm gonna hire him.

27:28.527 --> 27:30.359
No.

27:30.359 --> 27:31.610
You looked me in the eye
and promised me --

27:31.610 --> 27:34.734
Do you know he deleted
your Stanford acceptance?

27:34.734 --> 27:39.408
And he has the capacity
to hack my files -- God forbid.

27:39.408 --> 27:43.953
Point is, he's farther down
the rabbit hole than we thought.

27:43.953 --> 27:45.544
I'll hire him
to work in the clinic,

27:45.544 --> 27:47.957
we'll bury him
in busywork.

27:47.957 --> 27:50.710
No more sticking his nose
where it doesn't belong.

27:50.710 --> 27:52.341
Sound good?

28:14.113 --> 28:16.235
They're not
gonna file anything.

28:16.235 --> 28:17.446
Get up.

28:17.446 --> 28:19.488
Michaela.

28:19.488 --> 28:21.991
I know now why you're not
supposed to meet your heroes.

28:21.991 --> 28:23.082
You're gonna pick a fight

28:23.082 --> 28:24.663
after I saved your drunk ass
from jail?

28:24.663 --> 28:27.957
I was drunk.
I am totally sober now.

28:27.957 --> 28:28.998
Say what you need to say.

28:30.329 --> 28:31.670
No.

28:31.670 --> 28:33.462
This is a child's behavior.
You're better than this.

28:33.462 --> 28:35.795
Oh, my God!
Was that a compliment?

28:35.795 --> 28:37.466
You're very smart and pretty.
Is that what you want to hear?

28:37.466 --> 28:38.758
Get in the car!

28:38.758 --> 28:40.389
God!

28:40.389 --> 28:43.102
You can't just expect us
to be like you!

28:43.102 --> 28:45.224
I am trying --
I am --

28:45.224 --> 28:46.555
but the idea
that we're just supposed

28:46.555 --> 28:49.188
to go back to being normal,
become stupid lawyers...

28:49.188 --> 28:50.729
Well,
I'm not normal anymore!

28:50.729 --> 28:51.811
You were never normal!

28:51.811 --> 28:54.273
You just didn't know it
until now.

28:54.273 --> 28:56.735
God,
you're such a bitch.

28:58.778 --> 29:00.659
You were strong enough
to run away from a bad family,

29:00.659 --> 29:03.742
so you're strong enough
to get through this.

29:03.742 --> 29:05.454
That's why
I never worried about you.

29:08.577 --> 29:11.750
Next time you want to
drink yourself silly, call me.

29:11.750 --> 29:12.872
I have
a full liquor cabinet,

29:12.872 --> 29:15.134
and I won't let you
drive home drunk.

29:15.134 --> 29:17.176
Okay?

29:17.176 --> 29:19.048
Now let's go.

29:19.048 --> 29:22.011
We look like we're working
the corner at this point.

29:31.230 --> 29:32.651
We are back on the record

29:32.651 --> 29:35.654
in the deportation proceeding
of Karim Assaf.

29:35.654 --> 29:37.696
Mr. Assaf,
it troubles me deeply

29:37.696 --> 29:40.319
that you pled guilty
to a distribution charge

29:40.319 --> 29:42.701
you're now saying
you did not commit.

29:42.701 --> 29:44.243
Can you tell me
why you did this?

29:44.243 --> 29:45.614
I hoped
it would minimize

29:45.614 --> 29:47.246
the chances
of me getting deported.

29:47.246 --> 29:48.497
So you lied under oath?

29:48.497 --> 29:50.499
Your Honor, I think
you should stick to the law.

29:50.499 --> 29:52.371
Yes. And I am sorry
for that.

29:52.371 --> 29:56.255
Mr. Assaf, this admission calls
into question your integrity,

29:56.255 --> 29:58.297
as well as everything positive

29:58.297 --> 30:01.180
that was said about you
in this courtroom today.

30:01.180 --> 30:02.761
I've therefore
come to the conclusion that,

30:02.761 --> 30:07.847
despite the excessive
community support shown here...

30:07.847 --> 30:09.768
I'm going to order
your deportation.

30:09.768 --> 30:11.730
Objection! The prior felony
has been vacated!

30:11.730 --> 30:13.893
Sit down.
Judge, there's
no legal obligation!

30:13.893 --> 30:15.524
-Enough!
-This is up to your discretion!

30:18.567 --> 30:20.239
Just let me tell them
the truth!
Stop it!

30:20.239 --> 30:21.740
But nothing about this
makes sense!

30:21.740 --> 30:24.073
It's such a waste.

30:24.073 --> 30:25.404
Justice
is the exception.

30:25.404 --> 30:27.907
You should know that
by now.

30:27.907 --> 30:29.248
Take the anger
that you're feeling

30:29.248 --> 30:31.290
and put it
into your next case.

30:49.848 --> 30:51.140
Hey.

30:51.140 --> 30:52.471
So...

30:52.471 --> 30:54.853
you're gonna be mad,
but Annalise offered me a job,

30:54.853 --> 30:57.106
and I want to take it,
so...

30:57.106 --> 31:00.029
Yeah, she told me.
Um...

31:00.029 --> 31:02.611
I think
it's a great idea.

31:02.611 --> 31:04.323
You do?

31:04.323 --> 31:06.615
Yeah. I do.

31:06.615 --> 31:09.989
She also told me
about Stanford.

31:13.872 --> 31:15.414
Is it true?

31:19.258 --> 31:22.761
All right,
uh...here's the thing.

31:22.761 --> 31:26.595
The fact that you felt
that you had to do that,

31:26.595 --> 31:28.347
I mean, that tells me
that, you know,

31:28.347 --> 31:30.349
I just -- I wasn't listening
when you said

31:30.349 --> 31:31.810
that you didn't want
to move.

31:31.810 --> 31:35.564
I was just putting my feelings
before yours.

31:35.564 --> 31:37.516
And I'm sorry for that.

31:40.319 --> 31:41.610
You're sorry?

31:43.822 --> 31:45.364
Yeah.

31:48.027 --> 31:50.119
This...

31:50.119 --> 31:52.661
This isn't okay.

31:52.661 --> 31:53.993
You get to be angry.

31:53.993 --> 31:55.584
But I'm not.
Well, you should be.

31:55.584 --> 31:56.535
Says who?

31:56.535 --> 31:59.418
Anybody
who hears this story!

31:59.418 --> 32:00.879
I stole an amazing opportunity
from you --

32:00.879 --> 32:02.041
Yeah, and --
and I'm forgiving you.

32:02.041 --> 32:03.212
Which isn't okay!

32:03.212 --> 32:05.174
You should be pissed off.

32:05.174 --> 32:07.046
And -- And yelling.

32:07.046 --> 32:09.008
But the fact
that you're not is...

32:09.008 --> 32:10.929
Maybe we're just
both messed up,

32:10.929 --> 32:13.722
or the sex is so good
that we can't see it,

32:13.722 --> 32:16.185
but this is not what a healthy
relationship looks like.

32:16.185 --> 32:18.017
We're the best relationship
that I know.

32:18.017 --> 32:19.438
Well, then,
that's really sad.

32:19.438 --> 32:22.231
How is that sad?
I love you, Oliver.

32:22.231 --> 32:23.522
Wow. Seriously?

32:23.522 --> 32:25.734
That's your response
to finding out I lied to you?

32:25.734 --> 32:28.617
Everyone lies
in relationships.
No. No.

32:28.617 --> 32:30.369
I don't.

32:30.369 --> 32:32.161
Or, at least, I don't want to be
someone who does.

32:32.161 --> 32:34.703
So...

32:34.703 --> 32:36.125
"So"?

32:37.746 --> 32:38.998
"So" what?

32:44.753 --> 32:46.045
I love you.

32:47.796 --> 32:48.927
I love you so much.

32:48.927 --> 32:50.139
Okay,
now you're scaring me.

32:50.139 --> 32:53.012
Just --
Hey, let me say this.

32:53.012 --> 32:55.934
You've been
so good to me.

32:55.934 --> 32:57.686
Like, you stayed with me

32:57.686 --> 32:59.558
even when most guys
would've run,

32:59.558 --> 33:03.812
but...you didn't even
bat an eye.

33:03.812 --> 33:05.364
You just loved me.

33:05.364 --> 33:06.815
And you loved me back.

33:06.815 --> 33:09.448
I know, but I'm different now
than when we first met.

33:09.448 --> 33:11.410
How is that my fault?
It's not your fault.

33:11.410 --> 33:12.411
I just don't know
who I am anymore.

33:12.411 --> 33:13.662
We all
go through that --

33:13.662 --> 33:17.116
Yeah, but I think
it would be better for me

33:17.116 --> 33:19.538
if I went through it
alone.

33:24.753 --> 33:27.426
So, what?

33:27.426 --> 33:29.218
You're saying
that you, uh...

33:29.218 --> 33:31.220
Do you want to take a break
or something?

33:34.843 --> 33:37.516
I think
we should break up.

33:47.856 --> 33:50.989
Professor Keating.
I'm so sorry to make you wait.

33:50.989 --> 33:53.112
You're the new president.
Everyone wants a piece of you.

33:53.112 --> 33:54.493
Congratulations,
by the way.

33:54.493 --> 33:56.415
Thank you.
Let's see how long I last.

33:57.616 --> 33:59.748
Please, have a seat.

33:59.748 --> 34:02.251
Well, first...

34:02.251 --> 34:06.255
let me say
I'm an admirer.

34:06.255 --> 34:09.258
You've broken many
a glass ceiling on this campus.

34:09.258 --> 34:10.719
That's nice
but not true.

34:10.719 --> 34:13.011
Take the compliment.

34:13.011 --> 34:15.053
Thank you.

34:15.053 --> 34:16.975
You're wondering why
you're here.

34:16.975 --> 34:18.767
I am.

34:20.809 --> 34:22.561
We've decided
to transition you

34:22.561 --> 34:24.733
into a research position
this year

34:24.733 --> 34:28.147
and have a new professor teach
Introduction to Criminal Law.

34:28.147 --> 34:30.068
I wanted you to hear it
directly from me,

34:30.068 --> 34:32.571
as I know how important
that class is to you.

34:32.571 --> 34:35.784
We simply think
it's the best decision for you

34:35.784 --> 34:37.246
and the university.

34:37.246 --> 34:39.458
Because you know
what's best for me?

34:39.458 --> 34:42.251
I'm on your side,
Annalise.

34:42.251 --> 34:43.792
There's not
that many of us --

34:43.792 --> 34:45.124
Then fire me for real.

34:45.124 --> 34:46.205
Nobody wants that.

34:46.205 --> 34:48.967
Then what do you want?

34:48.967 --> 34:50.879
Because it seems to me
you're punishing

34:50.879 --> 34:52.671
one of
your most esteemed professors

34:52.671 --> 34:54.383
due to tragedies
in her personal life.

34:54.383 --> 34:58.387
Actually...
it's precisely

34:58.387 --> 35:00.519
because of your performance
as a professor

35:00.519 --> 35:03.352
that we've made
this decision.

35:03.352 --> 35:05.354
The students
who work at your firm

35:05.354 --> 35:08.607
have historically graduated
at the top of their class.

35:08.607 --> 35:11.230
The five from this year,
however,

35:11.230 --> 35:14.733
all rank
in the bottom 10%.

35:18.036 --> 35:20.239
How about
a pro bono clinic?
Annalise --

35:20.239 --> 35:22.411
My reputation's a concern
for you. That's clear.

35:22.411 --> 35:24.122
So why not give me
a chance to repair it?

35:26.245 --> 35:28.667
I'll circle back
with the others,

35:28.667 --> 35:31.049
let you know
what they think.

36:04.833 --> 36:06.835
You see this?

36:08.997 --> 36:10.339
Oh.

36:10.339 --> 36:13.212
Good thing
it's not a real newspaper.

36:14.883 --> 36:16.795
The president
contact you yet?

36:16.795 --> 36:18.056
I'm ignoring her calls.

36:33.862 --> 36:35.984
You think it's Frank
putting them up?

36:41.530 --> 36:42.581
No.

36:45.454 --> 36:46.995
Because he's dead?

36:48.787 --> 36:51.380
I'd understand.

36:51.380 --> 36:53.882
He could destroy us all
if he wanted.

36:55.384 --> 36:57.095
Like I don't know that.

37:04.012 --> 37:06.935
It's all Sam's fault.

37:06.935 --> 37:09.648
He's the one
who made me hire Frank.

37:09.648 --> 37:11.019
Now look.

37:13.852 --> 37:15.854
I'm no killer, Bonnie.

37:19.528 --> 37:22.781
And God forbid I let
Frank make me into one.

37:26.915 --> 37:29.207
Bastard's not worth it.

37:39.838 --> 37:43.472
Sorry. I...thought
you were Meggy.

37:44.973 --> 37:46.515
You decorated?

37:46.515 --> 37:47.225
Yeah.

37:47.225 --> 37:48.016
Meggy's idea?

37:50.349 --> 37:52.391
She's really nice.

37:52.391 --> 37:54.022
Nicer than me, you mean.

37:54.022 --> 37:55.444
I didn't say that.

37:55.444 --> 37:56.775
Why are you being
such a jerk?

37:59.358 --> 38:01.780
Fine.

38:01.780 --> 38:03.241
I'll go.
Laurel, I --

38:03.241 --> 38:05.744
You won't even respond
to my texts!

38:08.457 --> 38:09.287
I'm sorry.

38:09.287 --> 38:10.669
I don't want you
to be sorry.

38:10.669 --> 38:12.290
I just want you
to talk to me.

38:12.290 --> 38:13.502
I want that, too.

38:13.502 --> 38:15.083
Well,
then what's wrong?

38:16.965 --> 38:20.339
When I look at you...

38:20.339 --> 38:22.260
all I see is Frank.

38:22.260 --> 38:25.093
And I need to forget
what he did.

38:29.808 --> 38:32.190
I will never forgive him
for what he did to you.

38:32.190 --> 38:34.192
You know that, right?
Of course.

38:34.192 --> 38:37.816
And I --
I wish I didn't...

38:37.816 --> 38:39.237
equate you with him.

38:42.941 --> 38:44.613
I just...

38:48.577 --> 38:50.579
Uh...

38:50.579 --> 38:52.210
Meggy's on her way.

38:54.122 --> 38:56.124
I should go.

39:06.224 --> 39:07.926
Hi.
Hi!

39:07.926 --> 39:10.098
I'm Laurel.
I'm Wes' friend.

39:10.098 --> 39:12.020
I was just here
to drop off an outline --

39:12.020 --> 39:14.232
Wait.
Like, the Laurel?

39:14.232 --> 39:16.605
Wes talks about you
all the time.

39:16.605 --> 39:18.066
He does?
Yes.

39:18.066 --> 39:19.608
And no handshakes.
I'm a hugger.

40:25.924 --> 40:27.546
I said hang up!

40:40.559 --> 40:41.980
You got a creaky stair.
