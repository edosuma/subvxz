( gasps )

00:27.695 --> 00:29.563
( over radio ):
Charlie Six,
this is Viper One-One.

00:29.597 --> 00:31.365
Viper One-One, cleared hot.

00:31.399 --> 00:34.335
Solid copy, Charlie Six.
Cleared hot.

00:52.320 --> 00:54.188
Call it off!
Call it off!

00:54.222 --> 00:55.423
Abort! Abort! Abort!

00:55.456 --> 00:56.790
Viper One-One, abort.
Do you copy?

00:56.824 --> 00:58.392
Abort! Abort! Stand down!

00:58.426 --> 01:00.261
Stand down!
Call off dash two!

01:00.294 --> 01:01.629
Call off dash two!

01:49.643 --> 01:52.146
( music plays )

02:01.955 --> 02:04.292
Wow, she's pretty flexible.

02:04.325 --> 02:06.594
Just don't let her catch you
looking at her, Probie.

02:11.832 --> 02:13.901
I think she saw me.

02:13.934 --> 02:15.169
She gave me that look.

02:15.203 --> 02:16.370
What look?

02:16.404 --> 02:17.805
The look she's always
giving you.

02:20.841 --> 02:22.876
Yep. She saw you.

02:22.910 --> 02:24.345
Hope you wore a cup.

02:25.513 --> 02:29.783
Okay, welcome to my version
of close combat training.

02:29.817 --> 02:31.552
McGee.
Yeah?

02:31.585 --> 02:33.521
You start with Kate.

02:35.856 --> 02:38.826
Go on.

02:38.859 --> 02:40.628
All right.

02:40.661 --> 02:42.830
You and me in
the ring today.
You sure about that?

02:42.863 --> 02:44.865
I've been taking classes.

02:44.898 --> 02:46.700
In what?
Boxing.

02:56.977 --> 02:59.880
We're grappling today.

02:59.913 --> 03:01.782
You want to grapple?

03:01.815 --> 03:03.284
Yeah.

03:03.317 --> 03:05.219
You have a problem with that?

03:05.253 --> 03:07.955
No, it's just, you know, I did
some wrestling in high school.

03:09.457 --> 03:11.392
Did you, now?

03:17.030 --> 03:19.533
( groans )

03:23.904 --> 03:27.508
Hoo-hoo, come on.
Why I ought to...

03:37.551 --> 03:39.753
Not bad, DiNozzo.

03:39.787 --> 03:40.821
Thanks.
You learn how to box

03:40.854 --> 03:41.722
in the Marines?

03:41.755 --> 03:42.723
No.

03:42.756 --> 03:44.425
Corps doesn't teach boxing.

03:44.458 --> 03:46.394
That's your loss.

03:50.598 --> 03:53.634
They teach fighting.

03:53.667 --> 03:55.936
( cell phone rings )

03:55.969 --> 03:57.405
Your phone.

03:57.438 --> 03:59.407
( cell phone ringing )

04:06.647 --> 04:07.881
Gibbs.

04:12.853 --> 04:14.922
( groans )

04:14.955 --> 04:17.458
Have I mentioned that
I was hand picked to protect

04:17.491 --> 04:19.026
the President
of the United States?

04:19.059 --> 04:19.827
Five times.

04:19.860 --> 04:22.062
You gonna take that abuse,
McGee?

04:22.095 --> 04:23.464
( groans )

04:23.497 --> 04:24.598
No!

04:28.336 --> 04:29.803
That's more like it, McGee.

04:29.837 --> 04:30.804
Why were you
holding back?

04:30.838 --> 04:33.374
Well, you're...
I mean, I've never wrestled...

04:33.407 --> 04:35.075
A girl?
No.

04:35.108 --> 04:36.577
Tony...

04:36.610 --> 04:37.978
I look like a girl
to you?

04:38.011 --> 04:41.048
All I see are two
NCIS Special Agents.

04:41.081 --> 04:42.550
Me, too.

04:43.617 --> 04:45.619
( groans )

04:46.754 --> 04:47.921
Training's over.

04:47.955 --> 04:49.457
We're heading to Quantico.

04:49.490 --> 04:52.025
Guy tried to outrun
a 500-pound bomb.

04:52.059 --> 04:53.026
And...?

04:53.060 --> 04:54.362
He lost.

04:58.766 --> 04:59.967
Hey.

05:00.000 --> 05:01.902
She had three older brothers
growing up.

05:01.935 --> 05:04.071
I think there's
some unresolved issues there.

05:04.104 --> 05:06.306
You think?

05:13.881 --> 05:16.750
Break out the gear.

05:16.784 --> 05:19.319
I'm going to find out
who's in charge of this circus.

05:20.721 --> 05:22.022
You didn't have
to stop like that.

05:22.055 --> 05:23.457
I know that.

05:25.559 --> 05:26.960
Sorry about that, Probie.

05:26.994 --> 05:28.629
But it's your fault.

05:28.662 --> 05:30.130
My fault?

05:30.163 --> 05:31.465
Yeah, the brakes grab.

05:31.499 --> 05:33.367
It's your job
to see the vehicle's

05:33.401 --> 05:34.602
in perfect running condition.

05:35.869 --> 05:37.605
You should've called.

05:37.638 --> 05:39.540
I could've saved
you guys a trip.

05:39.573 --> 05:42.476
Why don't we start with,
who the hell are you?

05:42.510 --> 05:45.012
Gunnery Sergeant
De Luca, CID.

05:45.045 --> 05:48.482
Is this your idea of
how to run a crime scene,
Gunnery Sergeant?

05:48.516 --> 05:49.617
Nope.

05:49.650 --> 05:50.851
It's my idea
of how to run

05:50.884 --> 05:52.486
an accidental death
investigation,

05:52.520 --> 05:53.621
Special Agent...?

05:53.654 --> 05:54.488
Gibbs.

05:54.522 --> 05:57.391
Well, a civilian
decided to trespass

05:57.425 --> 05:59.126
at the wrong place
at the wrong time.

05:59.159 --> 06:00.928
Marines didn't spot him
till it was too late.

06:00.961 --> 06:03.096
What was a civilian
doing down there?

06:03.130 --> 06:06.467
My guess,
he was a scavenger.

06:06.500 --> 06:07.501
Lot of metal
and scrap iron's

06:07.535 --> 06:08.869
been dumped here
over the years.

06:08.902 --> 06:11.071
Enough to risk
blowing yourself up over?

06:11.104 --> 06:14.408
I didn't say he was smart,
Agent Gibbs.

06:14.442 --> 06:15.375
But, hey, you want NCIS

06:15.409 --> 06:17.478
to handle the paperwork
on this one? Fine.

06:17.511 --> 06:18.779
Get down there,

06:18.812 --> 06:20.981
secure the scene.
Just make sure
your people

06:21.014 --> 06:22.149
stay inside
the marked areas

06:22.182 --> 06:23.183
cleared by EOD

06:23.216 --> 06:26.654
I don't need another
dead civilian on my hands.

06:28.822 --> 06:30.891
Attractive.
I want everybody
off this range

06:30.924 --> 06:32.426
except EOD personnel.

06:32.460 --> 06:34.094
What about
Mr. Potato Head?
No.

06:35.162 --> 06:35.929
He stays.

06:35.963 --> 06:38.131
With luck,
he'll spit on my boots.

06:38.165 --> 06:41.068
Looking for a reason to
whack him in the head, Gibbs?

06:41.101 --> 06:42.836
No. To shoot him.

06:42.870 --> 06:46.507
Tony, didn't you tell me
that you worked a case

06:46.540 --> 06:48.576
on a live-impact range once?

06:48.609 --> 06:49.577
Yeah, that's right.

06:49.610 --> 06:51.812
Fort A.P. Hill.
Tragic.

06:51.845 --> 06:53.581
What happened?

06:53.614 --> 06:55.583
EOD missed ordnance
marking the path.

06:55.616 --> 06:56.517
Boom!

06:56.550 --> 06:59.653
Agent walking point,
a probie, of course,

06:59.687 --> 07:00.988
blew his foot off.

07:01.021 --> 07:02.823
You're kidding, right?

07:02.856 --> 07:04.758
Of course I'm kidding...

07:04.792 --> 07:06.594
( laughs ) Probie.

07:13.634 --> 07:14.868
Do you really think he
was top of his class?

07:19.607 --> 07:21.642
We're right behind you, buddy.

07:21.675 --> 07:23.577
You're doing great.

07:29.583 --> 07:32.753
Some of them are buried
under the ground.

07:36.757 --> 07:38.191
Judging by the shrapnel pattern,

07:38.225 --> 07:40.628
I'd say our young victim
was running when he was hit.

07:40.661 --> 07:42.696
How can you tell,
doctor?

07:42.730 --> 07:44.998
Oh, I've seen far too many
of these types of wounds

07:45.032 --> 07:46.667
during my tour in Vietnam.

07:46.700 --> 07:49.136
What about the bruising
on his wrists and face, Duck?

07:50.237 --> 07:53.641
It's possible it was caused
by blast concussion.

07:53.674 --> 07:55.643
We'll know more
when we get him back.

07:57.878 --> 07:59.880
This guy was no scavenger, boss.

08:00.914 --> 08:02.650
Salvatore Ferragamo's.

08:02.683 --> 08:03.651
What?

08:03.684 --> 08:05.052
Italian shoes.

08:05.085 --> 08:06.654
Expensive.

08:06.687 --> 08:08.556
Pair I got cost
almost 500 bucks.

08:09.690 --> 08:12.560
Well, not everybody shops
at Wal-Mart.

08:12.593 --> 08:15.228
I'm not saying
you shop at Wal-Mart.

08:16.329 --> 08:18.632
Or even that that's a bad thing.

08:24.071 --> 08:25.172
How's it going, Kate?

08:25.205 --> 08:27.174
Almost finished.

08:27.207 --> 08:29.643
I've got McGee doing
measurements.

08:33.246 --> 08:34.948
What are you doing?

08:34.982 --> 08:36.784
Following our
victim's prints.

08:38.786 --> 08:41.855
They came from over there.

08:41.889 --> 08:44.324
Well, how'd he get
down here?

08:44.357 --> 08:46.727
We're at least five miles
from the nearest civilian road.

08:46.760 --> 08:50.030
Someone dropped him off.

08:59.707 --> 09:02.342
Hey! That area hasn't been
cleared yet.

09:02.375 --> 09:03.811
Agent Gibbs!

09:03.844 --> 09:05.779
Hey! You trying to get
yourself killed?

09:12.986 --> 09:15.689
Are you deaf or nuts?

09:17.057 --> 09:18.726
Little of both.

09:31.872 --> 09:34.742
You still think that this
was an accident, Gunny?

09:39.780 --> 09:42.182
Jimmy, run this
up to Abby for me.

09:43.784 --> 09:44.752
Uh, sure.

09:44.785 --> 09:45.619
Would it be okay if I stayed

09:45.653 --> 09:47.387
and chatted with her
for awhile, doctor?

09:47.420 --> 09:49.022
We're rather busy at the moment.

09:49.056 --> 09:50.958
Okay, so you're
saying that, uh...

09:50.991 --> 09:52.826
it's not okay, then?

09:54.762 --> 09:58.666
Sorry. Sorry. The accent kind
of throws me off sometimes.

09:58.699 --> 10:00.734
He means well,

10:00.768 --> 10:04.705
but often I have an overwhelming
urge to slap him.

10:04.738 --> 10:06.874
Is that wrong?

10:06.907 --> 10:08.876
Do it all the time.

10:08.909 --> 10:09.977
So I've noticed.

10:10.010 --> 10:11.378
But only on the back
of the head.

10:11.411 --> 10:14.247
A slap in the face
would be humiliating.

10:14.281 --> 10:15.749
Back of the head's
a wake up call.

10:16.850 --> 10:18.986
Looks like he got both.

10:19.019 --> 10:19.920
You were right.

10:19.953 --> 10:24.091
His facial injuries
weren't from the bombs.

10:24.124 --> 10:27.995
Our victim received
a rather savage beating

10:28.028 --> 10:29.162
before his death.

10:30.430 --> 10:32.766
And our crispy critter?

10:32.800 --> 10:35.235
He wasn't burned
by today's explosions.

10:35.268 --> 10:36.804
Tests indicate

10:36.837 --> 10:38.238
the poor chap's
been deceased

10:38.271 --> 10:40.073
at least six months.

10:40.107 --> 10:42.175
There are more bodies
out there.

10:42.209 --> 10:43.877
Yes. I was afraid of that.

10:43.911 --> 10:46.313
We've stumbled into a bone yard,
Duck.

10:46.346 --> 10:47.748
( sighs heavily )

10:47.781 --> 10:48.882
Yeah.

10:48.916 --> 10:50.851
Serial killer's dumping ground.

11:01.929 --> 11:04.264
This is Charlie
One, stand by.

11:04.297 --> 11:06.133
Hey, Gunny!

11:06.166 --> 11:07.334
Let me get back to you.

11:07.367 --> 11:08.335
Yo?

11:08.368 --> 11:08.902
Have a look.

11:08.936 --> 11:09.770
What have we got here?

11:16.744 --> 11:17.477
Well, that's not good.

11:17.510 --> 11:19.412
( hissing )

11:19.446 --> 11:20.213
You hear that?

11:20.247 --> 11:22.382
Yeah, what is that?

11:28.055 --> 11:28.889
Oh...

11:29.823 --> 11:30.724
Evac!

11:30.758 --> 11:32.425
Go! Go! Go!

11:32.459 --> 11:33.794
Go! Come on!
Let's go!

11:39.332 --> 11:43.837
( indistinct shouting )

11:45.538 --> 11:50.110
Well, at least I get
to give Gibbs the finger.

11:50.143 --> 11:52.813
ABBY:
I hear Kate kicked your
butt this morning, McGee.

11:52.846 --> 11:54.748
Well, you heard wrong.
It wasn't my butt.

11:54.782 --> 11:57.050
She kicked you in the...
Yeah.

11:57.084 --> 11:58.819
I thought I was
joining a Federal Agency,

11:58.852 --> 11:59.787
not reliving
my junior year

11:59.820 --> 12:00.487
in high school.

12:00.520 --> 12:01.254
Just remember,

12:01.288 --> 12:03.824
they torture you
because they care.

12:03.857 --> 12:05.759
So, if I make them
dislike me....

12:05.793 --> 12:06.426
It'll get worse.

12:06.459 --> 12:07.795
That's what I thought.

12:07.828 --> 12:09.529
Hey, I just I.D.'d

12:09.562 --> 12:11.198
your body.

12:11.231 --> 12:12.032
And he's cute.

12:12.065 --> 12:12.532
He's dead.

12:12.565 --> 12:13.767
I know.

12:15.435 --> 12:16.904
He's also a major criminal.

12:16.937 --> 12:18.338
What can I say,

12:18.371 --> 12:20.774
I'm attracted
to the bad boy...

12:20.808 --> 12:22.342
( beeping )

12:22.375 --> 12:23.276
No way.

12:23.310 --> 12:25.545
I'm getting hacked.

12:25.578 --> 12:27.014
McGEE:
A port scan?

12:27.047 --> 12:28.515
No, no, this is major.

12:28.548 --> 12:32.352
They've already burned through
the NCIS public firewall.

12:32.385 --> 12:33.854
Well, isolate
the node and dump

12:33.887 --> 12:35.388
them on the other
side of the router.

12:35.422 --> 12:37.257
I'm trying!
It's moving too fast.

12:39.893 --> 12:41.194
McGee:
Oh, this is not good.

12:41.228 --> 12:42.295
They're using
our connection

12:42.329 --> 12:43.864
with the AFIS
database-- sever it.

12:43.897 --> 12:45.132
I can't.
It's a point attack.

12:45.165 --> 12:47.134
He or she is only going
after my machine.

12:47.167 --> 12:49.036
It's not possible,
there's DOD

12:49.069 --> 12:50.037
Level Nine
encryption.

12:50.070 --> 12:50.904
It would
take months...

12:50.938 --> 12:51.905
DINES:
Hey.

12:51.939 --> 12:53.073
What is that,
a video game?

12:53.106 --> 12:54.174
No, Tony, we're
getting hacked.

12:54.207 --> 12:55.375
If they get
into Abby's computer,

12:55.408 --> 12:57.377
the entire NCIS
network is next.

12:57.410 --> 12:59.813
I can't stop him.
Do something, McGee.

12:59.847 --> 13:01.248
I've never seen
code like this.

13:04.251 --> 13:06.586
Ah, way to go, Abby.

13:06.619 --> 13:09.256
I didn't do anything.
I thought you did?

13:09.289 --> 13:10.557
No.

13:10.590 --> 13:12.926
I did.

13:21.501 --> 13:24.004
What the hell's
going on here?

13:24.037 --> 13:25.973
We were pulling
a fingerprint match

13:26.006 --> 13:27.841
from the AFIS database
and we set off

13:27.875 --> 13:28.675
some kind
of cyber attack.

13:28.708 --> 13:29.409
They were definitely
waiting for us.

13:29.442 --> 13:30.243
Who?

13:30.277 --> 13:32.012
I don't know, Tony,
and right now

13:32.045 --> 13:33.413
I'm afraid to turn
my machine back on.

13:33.446 --> 13:34.414
The speed they

13:34.447 --> 13:35.582
were cracking
our encryption at--

13:35.615 --> 13:36.416
there's only a few computers

13:36.449 --> 13:38.085
in the world
with that type of power.

13:38.118 --> 13:38.952
Name them.

13:38.986 --> 13:39.953
Well, the...

13:39.987 --> 13:41.321
the CERN institute in Geneva,

13:41.354 --> 13:43.356
um, IBM's research facility,

13:43.390 --> 13:44.624
rumors of a few in China.

13:44.657 --> 13:46.960
Oh, good, so it should
be easy to find them.

13:46.994 --> 13:48.061
Where's my match?

13:52.065 --> 13:53.967
China.

13:54.001 --> 13:55.268
You want some?

14:01.008 --> 14:01.975
Thanks.

14:10.984 --> 14:12.619
Whoever
this guy is,

14:12.652 --> 14:15.355
he's got some friends
in high places, Gibbs.

14:18.325 --> 14:21.895
KATE:
Victor Gera.
AKA Guido Valentino.

14:21.929 --> 14:23.263
Career criminal.

14:23.296 --> 14:25.132
Guido Valentino?

14:25.165 --> 14:26.566
That's the alias
he used in L.A.

14:26.599 --> 14:28.468
Started running numbers
in Chicago as a kid,

14:28.501 --> 14:30.137
moved onto jacking
cars as a teen,

14:30.170 --> 14:32.105
graduated to drug dealing
on the West Coast.

14:32.139 --> 14:34.007
Six months ago,
he showed up in D.C.

14:34.041 --> 14:35.042
Mafia?

14:35.075 --> 14:36.576
Well, with
names like Vic Gera

14:36.609 --> 14:38.011
and Guido Valentino,
what else?

14:38.045 --> 14:40.047
TONY:
Probie, in case
you forget,

14:40.080 --> 14:41.648
my name's
Tony DiNozzo.

14:41.681 --> 14:42.983
Italiano.

14:43.016 --> 14:45.518
Doesn't make me
Mafia, now does it?

14:45.552 --> 14:46.920
No.
Of course, not.

14:46.954 --> 14:47.687
I'm sorry.

14:47.720 --> 14:49.056
Prego.

14:49.089 --> 14:51.024
McGee, what's
the connection

14:51.058 --> 14:53.426
between small-time hood
and super computer?

14:53.460 --> 14:56.029
Well, I have no idea, boss.

14:56.063 --> 14:58.031
Ooh, wrong answer.

14:58.065 --> 14:59.499
I'll go look
for the right one now.

15:01.101 --> 15:03.070
Why would the mob, or anyone,

15:03.103 --> 15:05.038
stash bodies at
a Marine bombing range?

15:05.072 --> 15:06.173
Because it's

15:06.206 --> 15:07.640
the last place
you'd look for them.

15:07.674 --> 15:09.009
Who'd be nuts
enough to go

15:09.042 --> 15:10.010
down there
looking for bodies?

15:10.043 --> 15:10.978
Besides us?

15:11.011 --> 15:11.945
( phone ringing )

15:11.979 --> 15:13.580
Yeah, Gibbs.

15:13.613 --> 15:16.116
( indistinct talking )

15:16.149 --> 15:18.585
You did what?!

15:20.120 --> 15:20.787
I'm on my way!

15:20.820 --> 15:24.057
That was Gunny Sergeant De Luca.

15:24.091 --> 15:27.727
He's not done screwing up
my investigation.

15:27.760 --> 15:29.529
Wow.

15:29.562 --> 15:31.031
I thought you were
the only one

15:31.064 --> 15:32.532
who could piss him
off like that.

15:32.565 --> 15:34.001
You never met
his second wife.

15:38.738 --> 15:42.575
I told you not to touch anything
without my M.E. being present.

15:42.609 --> 15:44.677
I didn't really have
much of a choice.

15:44.711 --> 15:46.279
It was near
an unstable javelin round.

15:46.313 --> 15:48.982
It'd likely kill me and another
Marine when it exploded.

15:49.016 --> 15:50.183
Here.

15:51.351 --> 15:53.620
You have a body
that goes with this?

15:53.653 --> 15:55.688
I think it was destroyed
during the explosion.

15:55.722 --> 15:57.057
You think?

15:57.090 --> 15:59.126
Look, EOD kicked me
off the range.

15:59.159 --> 16:00.660
That whole entire
area's been declared

16:00.693 --> 16:01.628
off limits 'til
it's cleared.

16:01.661 --> 16:03.530
How long?

16:03.563 --> 16:04.331
Gibbs, there's decades

16:04.364 --> 16:06.266
of unexploded
ordnance down there.

16:06.299 --> 16:07.200
My guess,
three weeks,

16:07.234 --> 16:07.967
minimum.

16:08.001 --> 16:11.004
( cell phone beeping )

16:11.038 --> 16:14.507
You're welcome, Agent Gibbs.

16:16.376 --> 16:20.347
Gunny, you coming?

16:26.419 --> 16:28.721
ABBY:
I set up a virtual model
emulating my system.

16:28.755 --> 16:31.324
He comes back again,
we can dump him into it.

16:31.358 --> 16:32.492
Won't fool him for long.

16:32.525 --> 16:33.693
All I need is a minute

16:33.726 --> 16:36.596
to back-trace his connection.

16:36.629 --> 16:38.231
Okay, I'm ready.

16:38.265 --> 16:39.566
Plug me in, McGee.

16:45.672 --> 16:46.739
Round two.

16:48.408 --> 16:51.478
He's still there
and coming on strong.

16:51.511 --> 16:55.282
Initiating
my back-trace... now.

16:56.416 --> 16:58.118
McGEE:
Oh, this guy is good.

16:58.151 --> 17:00.453
He's almost made it through
your little virtual world.

17:00.487 --> 17:02.289
Yeah, but I'm better.

17:03.690 --> 17:06.126
Oh, got you!

17:06.159 --> 17:09.096
Ha! Now let's see
who we're dealing with.

17:13.866 --> 17:15.402
Oh, my God.

17:15.435 --> 17:18.271
Gibbs is going to kill you.

17:18.305 --> 17:19.406
Kill me? Why?

17:19.439 --> 17:20.607
I'm not gonna tell him.

17:20.640 --> 17:23.643
( sighs )

17:23.676 --> 17:26.446
EOD has cleared 10%
of the range so far.

17:26.479 --> 17:29.349
In this small area and in
a relatively short span of time,

17:29.382 --> 17:30.483
we found three bodies.

17:30.517 --> 17:32.685
Do the math and we
could be looking at

17:32.719 --> 17:35.122
potentially 30 or more victims
concealed down there.

17:35.155 --> 17:37.390
Gunny, I want you
to coordinate with
the Provost Martial.

17:37.424 --> 17:39.726
I want a cordon around that
range 24 hours a day.

17:39.759 --> 17:41.328
Agent Gibbs,
that's a lot of man power.

17:41.361 --> 17:42.395
You really think...

17:42.429 --> 17:43.596
Well, then you'd
better get moving.

17:43.630 --> 17:44.597
Right.

17:44.631 --> 17:47.134
Is there
some secret

17:47.167 --> 17:48.368
to getting on his good side?

17:48.401 --> 17:49.569
Oh, there's no secret.

17:49.602 --> 17:51.171
He doesn't have one.

17:51.204 --> 17:53.473
Uh, excuse me,
boss?
What?

17:53.506 --> 17:56.843
We completed the back-trace
on the intruder's system.

17:56.876 --> 17:58.245
Yeah?

17:58.278 --> 17:59.746
Yeah, and, uh...

17:59.779 --> 18:01.448
Well, the thing is...

18:01.481 --> 18:02.315
( elevator dings )

18:02.349 --> 18:04.117
The hacker...

18:04.151 --> 18:04.717
It's me.

18:06.653 --> 18:09.522
Why is NCIS interested
in Vic Gera, Gibbs?

18:09.556 --> 18:11.324
Who said we were
interested in him?

18:11.358 --> 18:12.559
You ran his prints
through AFIS.

18:12.592 --> 18:13.360
Where'd you get them?

18:13.393 --> 18:14.327
He gave them to us.

18:14.361 --> 18:15.595
You have him in custody?

18:15.628 --> 18:17.797
Technically speaking.

18:23.470 --> 18:24.604
Where'd you find him?

18:24.637 --> 18:26.506
On a live fire range
at Quantico.

18:27.707 --> 18:29.209
He was killed in a practice

18:29.242 --> 18:30.577
bomb drop this morning.

18:30.610 --> 18:32.145
He Mafia?

18:32.179 --> 18:35.282
He's an undercover
FBI Agent, DiNozzo.

18:35.315 --> 18:36.583
When we saw your
print search,

18:36.616 --> 18:38.185
we were hoping Vic was alive.

18:38.218 --> 18:39.619
I want his killer, Gibbs.

18:39.652 --> 18:42.355
Is that an offer
for a joint investigation?

18:42.389 --> 18:44.291
I can't.

18:44.324 --> 18:48.328
Kate, Tony,
escort our guests out.

18:50.430 --> 18:52.332
I need to talk
to you alone.

18:56.303 --> 18:58.070
Our usual
conference room.

19:01.941 --> 19:03.276
What's going on?

19:03.310 --> 19:04.877
Fornell seems unusually upset.

19:04.911 --> 19:06.946
For an FBI Agent.

19:06.979 --> 19:09.316
How would you feel
if one of your team

19:09.349 --> 19:10.417
was lying
on a slab?

19:10.450 --> 19:11.651
Depends on who it was.

19:11.684 --> 19:13.286
You always a smart ass?

19:13.320 --> 19:15.222
Just to you boys
from the Hoover building.

19:31.604 --> 19:34.441
I'm listening.

19:34.474 --> 19:36.876
Jimmy Napalitano.
Know him?

19:36.909 --> 19:40.313
Fat, ugly Mafioso,
runs the business

19:40.347 --> 19:41.781
in Maryland,
Virginia and D.C.

19:41.814 --> 19:43.350
I've spent half my career

19:43.383 --> 19:45.885
trying to put that
bastard behind bars.

19:45.918 --> 19:48.421
Three trials, three times
he walked on a technicality.

19:48.455 --> 19:51.358
Tough to be sympathetic,
considering you let Ari go.

19:51.391 --> 19:53.493
Ari's a valuable
intelligence asset, Gibbs.

19:53.526 --> 19:54.961
Napalitano's
nothing

19:54.994 --> 19:56.329
but a cheap hood.

19:56.363 --> 19:57.430
Ari shot one of my people,

19:57.464 --> 20:00.567
kidnapped one of my agents,
put a round through me.

20:00.600 --> 20:02.502
I don't see the difference,
Fornell.

20:02.535 --> 20:04.471
I knew this was a waste of time.

20:04.504 --> 20:06.439
At least we agree on something.

20:09.809 --> 20:12.745
Anyone ever tell you
you're an insufferable bastard?

20:12.779 --> 20:15.515
Yeah.

20:15.548 --> 20:17.517
Damn it, Jethro, I'm here
because I need your help.

20:17.550 --> 20:19.652
I offered a joint
investigation.

20:19.686 --> 20:20.953
You turned it down.

20:20.987 --> 20:23.923
I couldn't say anything
in front of those Agents.

20:23.956 --> 20:24.957
You don't trust them?

20:28.961 --> 20:31.398
Napalitano's always been
a step ahead of me.

20:31.431 --> 20:32.532
Every informant, every agent

20:32.565 --> 20:33.666
I get close to him

20:33.700 --> 20:35.768
ends up like
that kid downstairs.

20:35.802 --> 20:37.437
No one's that lucky.

20:37.470 --> 20:38.671
He's got a mole
in the Bureau.

20:38.705 --> 20:40.673
Or someone with access
to my operations.

20:40.707 --> 20:42.542
Why not take it
to Internal Affairs?

20:42.575 --> 20:43.710
They can't help me.

20:43.743 --> 20:44.811
But I can?

20:44.844 --> 20:48.448
Realizing how sad this sounds,

20:48.481 --> 20:51.718
you're the closest thing I have
to a friend, Gibbs.

20:54.754 --> 20:56.489
You dying or something?

20:57.590 --> 20:58.358
Okay, not dying.

20:58.391 --> 21:00.693
This some part of
a 12-step program?

21:00.727 --> 21:02.362
Look, you going
to help me or not?

21:02.395 --> 21:03.596
I'm thinking about it.

21:03.630 --> 21:04.564
It's settled then.

21:08.568 --> 21:10.470
This isn't your style, Tobias.

21:10.503 --> 21:13.473
I know it.

21:13.506 --> 21:15.442
The Bureau
believes

21:15.475 --> 21:19.579
that the mole who put
my man on your slab....

21:21.481 --> 21:22.915
is me.

21:25.518 --> 21:26.619
Sorry, Tobias.

21:44.471 --> 21:45.538
MAN:
Oh, what is this?

21:45.572 --> 21:46.706
I'm on break.
Come on!

21:46.739 --> 21:49.742
Get me some booze here.

21:49.776 --> 21:52.812
Hey, Tiffany, enough
with the smoking already.

21:52.845 --> 21:54.113
Get off my back, Ricky.

21:54.146 --> 21:56.483
I pay you to dance,
not get lung cancer.

21:56.516 --> 21:57.550
All right, already.

21:57.584 --> 22:00.987
I thought Tiffany
was your numero uno?

22:01.020 --> 22:03.456
Nah, I dumped her.

22:03.490 --> 22:05.458
Rickey, how do ya
dump somethin'

22:05.492 --> 22:06.859
that looks like that?
It's easy.

22:06.893 --> 22:09.396
Ba-da bing,
ba-da boom. Ciao!

22:09.429 --> 22:10.096
( laughs )

22:10.129 --> 22:11.831
I gotta remember that one.

22:11.864 --> 22:14.901
The comedian is Napalitano's
son, Little Rickey.

22:14.934 --> 22:16.703
Who's the muscle
with him?

22:16.736 --> 22:17.904
Sal Balducci,

22:17.937 --> 22:20.373
Napalitano's enforcer.

22:20.407 --> 22:23.376
And that's the man himself.
Jimmy Napalitano,

22:23.410 --> 22:24.844
AKA Jimmy Naps.

22:24.877 --> 22:26.012
He's politically connected

22:26.045 --> 22:29.081
and has the finest
lawyers money can buy.

22:29.115 --> 22:30.917
He's virtually untouchable.

22:30.950 --> 22:31.984
We got a problem.

22:32.018 --> 22:33.420
What kind of problem, Pops?

22:33.453 --> 22:34.487
Not here.

22:34.521 --> 22:36.055
Inside.

22:39.792 --> 22:41.494
You got ears inside?

22:41.528 --> 22:43.996
No. Jimmy Naps is hi-tech.

22:44.030 --> 22:44.831
Camera two, get me tight

22:44.864 --> 22:46.799
on the thug
by the rear entrance.

22:46.833 --> 22:49.101
They find our bugs
and wiretaps

22:49.135 --> 22:50.770
before we finish
installing them.

22:50.803 --> 22:52.905
Or your mole
tips 'em off.

22:52.939 --> 22:54.474
There's no mole.

22:54.507 --> 22:55.942
Jimmy Naps set Fornell up.

22:55.975 --> 22:58.044
They study us like
we study them.

22:58.077 --> 23:00.413
Rumor has it they have dossiers
on all of us.

23:01.814 --> 23:03.583
They even know we're
watching them right now.

23:03.616 --> 23:06.553
Camera one, show me Abe.

23:07.654 --> 23:09.589
Hello, Abe.

23:09.622 --> 23:10.623
"Abe?"

23:10.657 --> 23:11.891
As in Vigoda.

23:11.924 --> 23:14.694
That's the FBI call sign
for him.

23:15.462 --> 23:17.129
Oh, yeah, it does

23:17.163 --> 23:18.264
sort of look like him.

23:18.297 --> 23:21.801
( like Abe Vigoda ):
Tom, can you get me off,

23:21.834 --> 23:23.603
for old time's sake?

23:23.636 --> 23:26.038
( mimics Duvall ):
Sorry, Solly. No can do.

23:26.072 --> 23:28.575
( gasping slowly )

23:28.608 --> 23:29.842
You two through?

23:29.876 --> 23:31.844
Sorry.

23:31.878 --> 23:33.680
Point is, Agent Gibbs,

23:33.713 --> 23:35.214
it's impossible
to get near them.

23:35.247 --> 23:37.884
Agent Gera did.

23:37.917 --> 23:39.919
And he's dead.

23:49.796 --> 23:50.930
Not much of a view.

23:53.966 --> 23:56.669
Kind of reminds me
of your basement.

23:56.703 --> 23:58.771
It's not dark enough.

23:58.805 --> 24:00.840
You see the Bureau's case
against me?

24:00.873 --> 24:03.776
You know that your people
won't share files with us.

24:05.645 --> 24:06.613
What's this supposed to be?

24:06.646 --> 24:07.747
Coffee.

24:07.780 --> 24:08.848
I'll take your word for it.

24:11.984 --> 24:13.820
They found two kilos of coke
and 50 grand

24:13.853 --> 24:15.788
in counterfeit bills
in my freezer.

24:15.822 --> 24:17.990
I thought the coke in ice cream
quarts was a nice touch.

24:18.024 --> 24:19.626
It was an expensive one.

24:19.659 --> 24:21.728
Jimmy Naps's going
to a lot of trouble

24:21.761 --> 24:22.895
to frame you, Tobias.

24:22.929 --> 24:23.896
Why now?

24:23.930 --> 24:25.732
He knew I was vulnerable.

24:25.765 --> 24:26.866
Vulnerable? How?

24:26.899 --> 24:28.635
Ari.

24:31.203 --> 24:32.772
You laying this on me, huh?

24:32.805 --> 24:36.075
I arranged your meeting
with him, Jethro.

24:36.108 --> 24:40.012
He's our only agent
inside Al Qaeda,

24:40.046 --> 24:43.015
and what did you do?

24:43.049 --> 24:44.016
You shot him.

24:44.050 --> 24:47.620
I could have killed him.

24:47.654 --> 24:48.855
Putting a round in his shoulder

24:48.888 --> 24:50.623
helped sell his cover
to Al Qaeda.

24:50.657 --> 24:53.292
Why don't you explain that
to the director?

24:53.325 --> 24:54.927
He didn't buy it when I did.

24:54.961 --> 24:58.865
Okay. If you think
it'll do any good.

25:00.066 --> 25:01.968
( chuckles )

25:05.104 --> 25:07.139
( sighs )

25:07.173 --> 25:09.909
I'm not getting out of this,
am I?

25:09.942 --> 25:14.213
Ah, you'll get out of it.

25:14.246 --> 25:17.950
It just may not be the way
you like.

25:24.991 --> 25:26.225
Duck,

25:26.258 --> 25:27.894
what do you got for me?

25:27.927 --> 25:30.229
Ah, I've identified
our second victim

25:30.262 --> 25:33.199
from the dental charts
supplied by the FBI.

25:33.232 --> 25:36.736
His name's Frank Pilato.

25:36.769 --> 25:37.604
Frankie P.

25:37.637 --> 25:39.706
He was to testify against

25:39.739 --> 25:42.575
Napalitano five years ago.

25:42.609 --> 25:45.712
Disappeared walking his dog
on a Sunday afternoon.

25:45.745 --> 25:48.080
Yeah, those Sunday afternoon
strolls can be dangerous.

25:48.114 --> 25:49.749
Ducky, I thought you said

25:49.782 --> 25:51.851
the test indicated he was dead
only five or six months ago.

25:51.884 --> 25:53.119
I did.

25:53.152 --> 25:54.921
Anyone care to guess
how he died?

25:54.954 --> 25:56.789
I'm going to go out on a limb
here and say...

25:56.823 --> 25:57.924
something to do with flames?

25:57.957 --> 25:59.058
And you'd be wrong, Tony.

25:59.091 --> 26:01.293
( Kate laughs )

26:01.327 --> 26:02.662
His throat was slit.

26:02.695 --> 26:03.796
KATE:
Bled to death.

26:03.830 --> 26:06.032
Actually, no, Kate.

26:10.002 --> 26:12.004
Lead poisoning.

26:12.038 --> 26:14.807
Three nine-millimeter slugs
to be exact.

26:14.841 --> 26:16.342
Administered at close range.

26:16.375 --> 26:17.644
He was kidnapped
in '99.

26:17.677 --> 26:19.145
And wasn't shot until
a few months ago?

26:19.178 --> 26:20.146
He was most likely

26:20.179 --> 26:22.949
executed years ago;

26:22.982 --> 26:26.318
His body has only
recently been exposed

26:26.352 --> 26:27.787
to the elements.

26:27.820 --> 26:29.321
Excuse me.

26:29.355 --> 26:35.862
His blood was drained after
death...

26:35.895 --> 26:37.630
and his body frozen.

26:37.664 --> 26:39.331
Jimmy Naps' version
of the ice man.

26:39.365 --> 26:42.068
They stashed the body
in a cooler somewhere

26:42.101 --> 26:44.036
and then dump it years later
when everyone's stopped looking.

26:44.070 --> 26:47.006
Yeesh. Shot, throat slit,
frozen and burned?

26:47.039 --> 26:49.041
Jimmy Naps definitely
didn't like this dude.

26:49.075 --> 26:52.344
The Mafia does tend to have
a flair for the dramatic, Tony.

26:52.378 --> 26:54.113
Anything on the finger parts

26:54.146 --> 26:55.314
Gunny De Luca picked up
on the range?

26:55.347 --> 26:56.215
I'm good, Jethro,

26:56.248 --> 26:58.184
but not that good.
I sent them up to Abby.

26:58.217 --> 26:59.185
Kate, Tony.

26:59.218 --> 27:01.888
On it, boss.

27:01.921 --> 27:03.055
Agent

27:03.089 --> 27:03.990
Charles,

27:04.023 --> 27:07.359
can you get me
the Bureau file
on Fornell?

27:07.393 --> 27:08.394
I haven't even seen it.

27:12.231 --> 27:14.767
I get caught, I'm finished
as a Federal Agent.

27:16.903 --> 27:17.937
Don't get caught.

27:43.262 --> 27:45.064
You know what
I think, McGee?

27:45.097 --> 27:45.865
What?

27:45.898 --> 27:47.399
I think you're more
interested in me

27:47.433 --> 27:48.935
than what I'm doing.

27:48.968 --> 27:51.037
That's not true.

27:51.070 --> 27:53.372
Wait, not that
I-I'm not interested...

27:53.405 --> 27:55.808
in you. I am.

27:55.842 --> 27:58.845
But I'm more interested
in the work.

27:58.878 --> 28:00.112
How could you say that?

28:00.146 --> 28:01.213
Because what
I'm looking at

28:01.247 --> 28:03.750
through the microscope...
Yeah?

28:03.783 --> 28:05.718
...is up there
on that screen.

28:07.820 --> 28:09.021
Hey, guys!

28:09.055 --> 28:11.057
You here
for the finger

28:11.090 --> 28:12.725
or the blood?
What blood?

28:12.759 --> 28:14.393
I found two types
on Agent Gera's face.

28:14.426 --> 28:15.394
One is his. One is not.

28:15.427 --> 28:17.063
So if he was beaten,

28:17.096 --> 28:19.198
you know, kind of like
the way you were

28:19.231 --> 28:20.332
yesterday by Gibbs,

28:20.366 --> 28:22.034
it could be the killer's.

28:22.068 --> 28:23.169
Kate, Kate, Kate,

28:23.202 --> 28:25.371
when I let Gibbs win,
we all win.

28:25.404 --> 28:27.339
And if I beat the
crap out of him,

28:27.373 --> 28:30.176
who do you think
he's going to take
it out on?

28:30.209 --> 28:33.445
Oh, that's right,
all of us.

28:33.479 --> 28:36.148
So you took a dive
for the team?

28:36.182 --> 28:37.216
Of course, McGee.

28:37.249 --> 28:38.184
It's good to know.

28:38.217 --> 28:40.086
It sure is.

28:41.954 --> 28:43.089
Turn around.

28:44.223 --> 28:45.457
I'm waiting for you

28:45.491 --> 28:47.226
to slap
the back of my head, boss.

28:47.259 --> 28:48.928
I'm not going
to slap your head.

28:49.962 --> 28:50.897
You're not?

28:50.930 --> 28:52.899
What, you don't think
I have a sense of humor?

28:52.932 --> 28:55.234
( laughs )

28:55.267 --> 28:58.070
Abbs, I need the DNA
on the unknown blood.

28:58.104 --> 28:59.171
I already started it.

28:59.205 --> 29:00.406
Okay, what about the finger?

29:00.439 --> 29:02.809
Any idea how long
it was it on the range?

29:02.842 --> 29:04.043
Well, ordinarily,
you can't date bone

29:04.076 --> 29:06.913
unless it's been in the ground
long enough to soak up fluorine.

29:06.946 --> 29:07.814
Which is, like,
hundreds of years.

29:07.847 --> 29:09.148
But sometimes being

29:09.181 --> 29:10.082
in a place
where things

29:10.116 --> 29:11.183
get blown up
is a good thing.

29:11.217 --> 29:13.786
I swabbed the finger
for explosives

29:13.820 --> 29:16.255
and I found traces of one:
mercury fulminate,

29:16.288 --> 29:19.859
which was completely phased out
by the military by 1986.

29:19.892 --> 29:21.293
Well, that means
the Mafia must have

29:21.327 --> 29:22.995
been dumping bodies
down there for...

29:23.029 --> 29:24.030
At least 18 years.

29:24.063 --> 29:25.197
Thank you, McGee.

29:25.231 --> 29:27.099
That's a good job, Abbs.

29:27.133 --> 29:28.500
McGee, find a way
to get Little Rickey's DNA.

29:28.534 --> 29:30.336
Okay.
Ow!

29:30.369 --> 29:32.138
It's no fun if you know
it's coming.

29:32.171 --> 29:34.273
Ow!

29:36.943 --> 29:37.977
What was that for?!

29:38.010 --> 29:39.045
( laughs )

29:41.047 --> 29:42.849
That's for eating
my sandwich.

29:52.458 --> 29:55.094
I know how
to get Little Rickey's DNA.

29:55.127 --> 29:56.128
Gonna sleep with him?

29:57.329 --> 29:59.331
He was hit
with two paternity suits

29:59.365 --> 30:01.067
in the last five years.

30:01.100 --> 30:03.035
Beat them both
with a DNA test.

30:03.069 --> 30:04.270
Nice try, Probie,

30:04.303 --> 30:07.206
but those tests
are sealed court records.

30:07.239 --> 30:08.908
Those court records
are sealed, McGee.

30:08.941 --> 30:11.978
Hey, that's what
I just said-- first!

30:12.011 --> 30:14.413
But not the records
from the lab that he used.

30:14.446 --> 30:15.481
It's downtown.

30:15.514 --> 30:17.984
You'll never get a judge
to sign off on that warrant.

30:18.017 --> 30:20.186
Maybe we don't need one.

30:20.219 --> 30:22.454
That is, if you're ready
to become a father.

30:22.488 --> 30:26.392
I think she's talking
to you, Probie.

30:26.425 --> 30:27.927
We go down to the lab

30:27.960 --> 30:29.228
and see if I'm carrying
your baby.

30:29.261 --> 30:30.329
It'll be fun.

30:30.362 --> 30:31.397
Oh, and we can steal

30:31.430 --> 30:33.099
Little Rickey's DNA test.

30:33.132 --> 30:34.200
Photograph it for Abby.

30:34.233 --> 30:35.001
I'll do it.

30:35.034 --> 30:37.069
Why you?

30:37.103 --> 30:40.106
You think anyone'd believe
you actually slept with Kate?

30:40.139 --> 30:40.940
Hey!

30:40.973 --> 30:42.174
I figured out how
to get

30:42.208 --> 30:43.442
Little Rickey's
DNA records.

30:43.475 --> 30:45.244
You mean I fig...

30:45.277 --> 30:46.512
Hey, there is no 'I'
in "team," McGee.

30:46.545 --> 30:48.948
How?
Paternity clinic downtown.

30:48.981 --> 30:50.116
Kate and I can have them
in an hour.

30:50.149 --> 30:51.283
Go get 'em.

30:51.317 --> 30:53.019
Atta boy...
Thank you, sir.

30:53.052 --> 30:54.220
McGee.

30:54.253 --> 30:56.923
I got the file on Fornell.

30:56.956 --> 30:58.157
Good.

30:58.190 --> 30:59.258
Not good.

31:03.395 --> 31:04.330
Fornell knew Jimmy Naps
was under surveillance.

31:04.363 --> 31:06.098
He can explain this.

31:06.132 --> 31:07.533
That photo came
from an anonymous source.

31:07.566 --> 31:11.103
From the newspaper blowup
you can see the date.

31:13.372 --> 31:14.540
The 17th?

31:14.573 --> 31:17.276
Tobias had me
pull surveillance
on the 17th.

31:19.145 --> 31:19.946
Why?

31:19.979 --> 31:22.248
Never said.

31:22.281 --> 31:24.984
But it's the day before
Agent Gera disappeared.

31:33.960 --> 31:36.295
( gasping )

31:48.740 --> 31:51.643
He didn't hang himself,
not Fornell.

31:51.677 --> 31:54.513
That's the coward's way out
and Tobias was no coward.

31:54.546 --> 31:56.282
Only one person was in
this cell with him today.

31:56.315 --> 31:57.316
Who?

31:57.349 --> 31:58.284
Me.

31:58.317 --> 31:59.485
To cut him down.

31:59.518 --> 32:00.953
Doctor...
Yes?

32:00.987 --> 32:02.688
I would like our M.E.,
Dr. Mallard,

32:02.721 --> 32:04.656
to receive a copy
of your autopsy report.

32:04.690 --> 32:06.525
Ducky? Of course.

32:11.730 --> 32:12.731
You writing
my name right?

32:12.764 --> 32:13.532
What?!

32:14.733 --> 32:17.970
I just want to know
if it's mine.

32:18.004 --> 32:20.339
She kind of sleeps around a lot,
if you know what I mean.

32:20.372 --> 32:21.407
If I did,

32:21.440 --> 32:23.275
it's 'cause he ain't
any good in bed.

32:23.309 --> 32:24.643
Least I didn't sleep
with my cousin.

32:24.676 --> 32:26.312
You slept with my sister.

32:26.345 --> 32:27.279
I thought it was you.

32:27.313 --> 32:28.314
She weighs 300 pounds.

32:28.347 --> 32:30.582
She was wearing your earrings.
Now that's enough.

32:30.616 --> 32:31.417
If you two can't be civil

32:31.450 --> 32:33.119
I'm going to have to
ask you leave.

32:35.387 --> 32:37.189
Look, is there anywhere

32:37.223 --> 32:38.624
that I can wait away from him,
please?

32:38.657 --> 32:40.459
I'm begging you.

32:40.492 --> 32:42.094
There's an empty
exam room behind you

32:42.128 --> 32:44.163
two doors on the right.

32:44.196 --> 32:45.231
Thank you.

32:45.264 --> 32:46.465
Mm-hmm.

32:53.505 --> 32:54.640
I'm sorry.

32:57.143 --> 32:58.677
She slept with my brother...

33:00.179 --> 33:02.314
and my best friend,

33:02.348 --> 33:03.649
at the same time.

33:06.352 --> 33:07.286
( toy squeaks )

33:14.226 --> 33:16.495
Okay, we've got Rickey's DNA
from the clinic.

33:16.528 --> 33:19.698
Let's see if we can match it to
our sample from the crime scene.

33:19.731 --> 33:22.368
We're cued up.
Initiating DNA match.

33:36.415 --> 33:38.217
That's it, it's
Rickey Napalitano's blood.

33:40.152 --> 33:40.852
Thanks, Abs.

33:40.886 --> 33:42.421
We made a good
couple, Kate.

33:42.454 --> 33:45.057
For The Jerry Springer Show.

33:46.725 --> 33:49.461
Dig your threads.

33:49.495 --> 33:51.263
You got to be kidding me?

33:51.297 --> 33:52.798
Un-freaking-believable,

33:52.831 --> 33:54.133
he whacked himself.

33:54.166 --> 33:55.467
Yeah, poor Fornell.

33:55.501 --> 33:57.436
You won't see him
no more, Pops.

33:57.469 --> 33:59.438
( siren )

33:59.471 --> 34:00.772
What the...?

34:05.211 --> 34:07.313
This guy's pulling us over,
boss.

34:07.346 --> 34:09.281
If I find out we got
a busted taillight

34:09.315 --> 34:11.317
or something, Sallie boy,
it's your ass.

34:23.662 --> 34:25.331
Is there a problem,
officer?

34:25.364 --> 34:26.798
You're talking
to the wrong person.

34:28.534 --> 34:29.501
Buona sera.

34:29.535 --> 34:31.470
We got a warrant for
your arrest, Little Dickey.

34:31.503 --> 34:32.804
It's Rickey.

34:32.838 --> 34:35.241
It's for murder, Dickey.
Come on.

34:35.274 --> 34:36.508
Get out.

34:36.542 --> 34:38.344
All right.

34:38.377 --> 34:39.645
Hands on the hood, big guy.

34:42.548 --> 34:43.415
Hand up.

34:43.449 --> 34:46.785
Who the hell are you guys
anyway, FBI?

34:46.818 --> 34:48.154
NCIS.

34:48.187 --> 34:49.087
Meat inspectors?

34:49.121 --> 34:51.223
Shut up, Rickey, will ya?
They're Navy cops.

34:51.257 --> 34:52.291
Turn around.

34:52.324 --> 34:54.126
Arrested by Navy cops?

34:54.160 --> 34:55.561
Talk about embarrassing.

34:55.594 --> 34:56.595
At least you're hot,
sweet...

34:56.628 --> 34:58.464
Oh! Ow! Oh!

34:58.497 --> 35:00.899
( groaning )
Oh...

35:00.932 --> 35:02.368
Take it easy, take it easy.

35:02.401 --> 35:03.435
Now that's embarrassing.

35:03.469 --> 35:04.670
Ow!

35:04.703 --> 35:06.472
Let's go.

35:06.505 --> 35:08.907
All right, don't worry.
Go with them, Rickey.

35:08.940 --> 35:11.177
Our lawyers'll
take care of this.

35:14.313 --> 35:16.448
I don't think
we've met, Agent...

35:16.482 --> 35:18.417
Special Agent. Gibbs.

35:18.450 --> 35:20.686
Special Agent Gibbs.

35:20.719 --> 35:23.455
So who is it my son was
supposed to have whacked?

35:23.489 --> 35:26.325
An FBI Agent.
Victor Gera.

35:26.358 --> 35:28.560
I remember something
about that.

35:28.594 --> 35:30.796
Something happened on
a marine base?

35:30.829 --> 35:32.164
What was that?

35:32.198 --> 35:33.265
Yeah, he got killed by a bomb.

35:33.299 --> 35:35.767
A bomb.
Yeah, yeah.

35:35.801 --> 35:36.768
Suppose-- God forbid--

35:36.802 --> 35:39.638
that my son could be
connected to this accident,

35:39.671 --> 35:42.308
what would you charge him with,
Special Agent Gibbs?

35:42.341 --> 35:43.675
Manslaughter.

35:43.709 --> 35:45.677
Manslaughter?
Manslaughter,

35:45.711 --> 35:47.846
what's the worst you can
get with that, Sallie?

35:47.879 --> 35:50.249
Four years. Does one.

35:50.282 --> 35:52.718
Might do the kid some good,
season him up a bit.

35:52.751 --> 35:55.387
Jail can be
a dangerous place.

35:55.421 --> 35:56.355
So they tell me.

35:56.388 --> 35:59.525
You remind me of somebody,
Special Agent Gibbs.

35:59.558 --> 36:03.695
Who was that guy that always
talking trash, that Fed?

36:03.729 --> 36:04.696
Fornell?

36:04.730 --> 36:07.399
Oh, yeah, Fornell.
That's it, yeah.

36:07.433 --> 36:08.400
Whatever happened to him?

36:08.434 --> 36:10.236
I think he hung himself.

36:10.269 --> 36:11.737
Real sad.

36:11.770 --> 36:13.439
Oh, yeah, it's terrible.

36:13.472 --> 36:15.307
All that ambition
and everything

36:15.341 --> 36:17.376
and he ends up
doing the twist.

36:17.409 --> 36:18.910
( chuckling )

36:23.449 --> 36:28.787
I get the government
agent on your payroll
by sunup, dirt bag...

36:28.820 --> 36:31.557
or Little Rickey
does the twist.

36:38.697 --> 36:41.567
Say I do this, all right?

36:41.600 --> 36:42.934
What do I get?

36:42.968 --> 36:45.337
I deliver
Little Rickey to you,

36:45.371 --> 36:47.839
the evidence against
him gets lost,

36:47.873 --> 36:49.808
and you never
see me again.

36:49.841 --> 36:52.811
You'd do all this just
to clear Fornell's name?

36:52.844 --> 36:55.414
He was my friend.

37:05.023 --> 37:07.359
You can't threaten to kill
someone in custody, Gibbs.

37:07.393 --> 37:08.494
It wasn't a threat.

37:08.527 --> 37:10.529
You'd really do it?

37:10.562 --> 37:11.963
Hey.

37:11.997 --> 37:15.401
You want to clear Tobias's name?
Hell, yes.

37:15.434 --> 37:17.336
But not by letting
Little Rickey off
for Vic's murder.

37:17.369 --> 37:19.004
Oh, he'll screw up again.

37:19.037 --> 37:22.007
You think Jimmy Naps
is going to make a swap

37:22.040 --> 37:24.543
and just let
you walk away?
I hope not.

37:24.576 --> 37:27.679
( cell phone rings )

37:29.315 --> 37:30.382
Gibbs.

37:30.416 --> 37:32.050
Rear of the club. One hour.

37:32.083 --> 37:34.753
Lose the Feds in the building
and in the alley.

37:34.786 --> 37:36.922
Oh, I can't do that.
I'm operating on my own hook.

37:36.955 --> 37:38.390
Pick another place.

37:38.424 --> 37:39.858
You want me to pick a place?

37:39.891 --> 37:41.026
I'm trying to show you

37:41.059 --> 37:43.362
there are no tricks here,
Jimmy boy.

37:43.395 --> 37:45.431
Coleman Park.
You know it?

37:45.464 --> 37:46.965
Yeah. Yeah, I know it.

37:46.998 --> 37:48.467
Come alone.

37:48.500 --> 37:51.470
( laughs )

37:51.503 --> 37:53.305
I'm not that stupid.

37:53.339 --> 37:55.307
All right,
we each bring a man.

37:55.341 --> 37:56.675
One hour.

37:56.708 --> 37:59.611
And, Gibbs...
you hurt my boy,

37:59.645 --> 38:02.614
I'll kill your brothers,
your uncles, your father...

38:02.648 --> 38:05.684
and after their funerals,
I'll kill you.

38:05.717 --> 38:07.786
No brothers, no uncles.

38:07.819 --> 38:09.655
My father passed years ago.

38:09.688 --> 38:12.691
I do have three ex-wives
whose names and addresses

38:12.724 --> 38:14.493
I will gladly fax on to you.

38:14.526 --> 38:15.627
( line clicks )

38:15.661 --> 38:17.963
Oh. He hung up.

38:22.100 --> 38:23.435
Whoa.

38:23.469 --> 38:25.404
Where do you three
think you're going?

38:25.437 --> 38:26.638
With you.
With you, boss.
With you.

38:26.672 --> 38:27.806
I can bring one back up.

38:29.841 --> 38:31.009
Clearly you should take me.

38:31.042 --> 38:32.544
( arguing )

38:32.578 --> 38:33.679
Kate, with
all due respect...

38:33.712 --> 38:36.348
( all talking at once )

38:36.382 --> 38:38.417
Are you kidding, Tony,
why should he bring you?

38:38.450 --> 38:39.851
With all due respect,
you have no idea...

38:39.885 --> 38:43.722
You're a total jackass.
Come on, you can conduct
yourself in the field?

38:43.755 --> 38:46.858
( arguing )

38:46.892 --> 38:48.059
( whistles )

38:48.093 --> 38:51.363
Agent Charles is going.

38:51.397 --> 38:53.665
Me?
Are you kidding, boss?

38:53.699 --> 38:54.566
He's kidding, right?

38:54.600 --> 38:55.601
I don't think he is, Tony.

38:55.634 --> 38:56.802
Gibbs, you need someone...

38:56.835 --> 39:00.406
Someone who can verify the guy
that Jimmy Naps turns over

39:00.439 --> 39:05.110
is FBI or Justice.

39:05.143 --> 39:06.512
Can any of you do that?

39:06.545 --> 39:07.713
He's right.

39:07.746 --> 39:09.848
I know the players.

39:09.881 --> 39:11.082
I go.

39:17.989 --> 39:21.159
These bracelets are killing me.

39:21.192 --> 39:22.661
You hear me?

39:32.971 --> 39:35.607
( car approaching )

39:47.853 --> 39:50.522
Stay there, Sallie.
Stay, stay.

39:53.559 --> 39:54.660
Where's my boy?

39:54.693 --> 39:55.861
Where's Rickey?

40:03.635 --> 40:04.803
Pops.

40:04.836 --> 40:06.071
Hey. You okay, son?

40:06.104 --> 40:07.539
No.

40:07.573 --> 40:09.808
Make them take these
freaking bracelets off me.

40:09.841 --> 40:12.644
Where's your end of the swap?

40:12.678 --> 40:14.846
I leave my backup at the car,
you do the same.

40:14.880 --> 40:16.515
Sallie, bring him out.

40:16.548 --> 40:18.016
Yeah, I got it.
Come on, let's go.

40:18.049 --> 40:19.150
Come on.
Come on, let's go.

40:19.184 --> 40:21.653
Chop-chop, let's go.

40:21.687 --> 40:23.188
We ain't got all day.

40:30.896 --> 40:33.899
That's Abe.
( laughing )

40:33.932 --> 40:35.701
Stupido.

40:35.734 --> 40:37.002
Pop, I had
nothing to do...

40:37.035 --> 40:38.870
Not you, not you.
This jabone.

40:38.904 --> 40:40.205
What'd you think I was gonna do,

40:40.238 --> 40:43.675
let you come in my backyard and
walk away with your coglioni?

40:43.709 --> 40:46.545
You know what
Primacord is, Jimmy?

40:46.578 --> 40:48.480
Primacord?

40:52.618 --> 40:53.719
Whoa! Hey!
( yelling )

40:57.656 --> 40:58.757
That was Primacord.

40:58.790 --> 41:02.494
This... is Primacord.

41:02.528 --> 41:04.095
( yelling ):
Oh! Oh! Pops!

41:04.129 --> 41:05.196
And this

41:05.230 --> 41:07.265
is a dead-man's switch.

41:07.298 --> 41:08.266
Oh, marone.

41:08.299 --> 41:10.602
Now we can still deal, Jimmy.

41:10.636 --> 41:14.773
All you have to do
is give me your mole's name.

41:24.650 --> 41:26.652
Yeah, that's what we thought.

41:26.685 --> 41:27.853
You dumb Wop.

41:27.886 --> 41:29.521
He never would've set it off.

41:29.555 --> 41:30.789
The blast would kill him.

41:30.822 --> 41:31.957
Who you gonna believe?

41:31.990 --> 41:34.526
He's pazzo, Pop.

41:34.560 --> 41:36.127
He'll do it. He'll do it.

41:36.161 --> 41:37.629
In fact,

41:37.663 --> 41:39.798
I think the blast
should kill all of you.

41:39.831 --> 41:43.702
You should've kept your
mouth shut, Napalitano.

41:43.735 --> 41:44.736
( shot fires )

41:47.639 --> 41:49.107
You lied to me, Jimmy.

41:49.140 --> 41:50.776
Like you didn't expect it.

41:50.809 --> 41:52.678
I just saved
all our lives.

41:52.711 --> 41:53.745
Now what?

41:53.779 --> 41:55.213
Ciao.

41:59.785 --> 42:01.920
Pops.

42:06.124 --> 42:07.693
Pops!

42:07.726 --> 42:09.761
You go to jail, you stay there
a couple of years,

42:09.795 --> 42:11.630
it'll do you good, son.

42:11.663 --> 42:13.765
Come on, come on,
come on, let's go.

42:13.799 --> 42:15.667
Hey, let's go.

42:15.701 --> 42:17.002
( door closes, engine starts )

42:21.773 --> 42:23.709
Get this thing off me.

42:24.676 --> 42:28.279
Here. Do it yourself.

42:28.313 --> 42:29.615
( screams )

42:33.184 --> 42:34.319
Boom.

42:41.126 --> 42:43.829
What you doing there,
Probie?

42:43.862 --> 42:45.263
I'm trying to find
what I missed.

42:45.296 --> 42:47.766
How did Gibbs know
that it was Charles?

42:47.799 --> 42:49.835
You mean you didn't know?

42:49.868 --> 42:51.603
He didn't know.

42:51.637 --> 42:52.403
What, you knew?

42:52.437 --> 42:54.840
We're seasoned
investigators, McGee.

42:54.873 --> 42:56.708
You have to start
thinking outside the box.

42:56.742 --> 42:58.209
Expect the unexpected.

42:58.243 --> 43:01.212
GIBBS:
Good advice, Tony.

43:02.413 --> 43:05.751
Agent Todd.
DiNozzo. McGee.

43:21.900 --> 43:23.101
