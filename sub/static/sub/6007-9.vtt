00:26.629 --> 00:29.931

00:29.965 --> 00:32.433

00:32.468 --> 00:33.835

What do we want to see next?

00:59.595 --> 01:00.835
How about somewhere
interesting?

01:00.863 --> 01:02.931
Field trips are supposed
to be fun.

01:02.965 --> 01:04.199
They're here to learn, John.

01:04.233 --> 01:05.800
I'm sure they're
learning a lot.

01:05.835 --> 01:07.235
All right,

01:07.269 --> 01:08.636
which of you are the good guys?

01:10.439 --> 01:12.273
Now, who wants to know
where the 911 calls go?

01:13.576 --> 01:14.876
Or...

01:14.910 --> 01:17.145
who wants to see
where we keep the guns?

01:20.249 --> 01:22.283
Well, who wants
to meet Captain Maldonado?

01:25.521 --> 01:27.355
Or who wants

01:27.389 --> 01:30.291
to see what happens to bad guys?

01:31.761 --> 01:33.695
Yeah.

01:33.729 --> 01:36.164
You guys remember
Johnny Horowitz, right?

01:36.198 --> 01:37.932
Well, old Johnny's luck

01:37.967 --> 01:39.000
eventually ran out.

01:39.034 --> 01:40.969
You see,
his organized crime pals,

01:41.003 --> 01:42.504
they did this to him.

01:42.538 --> 01:44.072
Blew his arm clean off.

01:46.142 --> 01:47.709
Okay.

01:47.743 --> 01:48.943
You know what,
come on, let's go.

01:48.978 --> 01:50.745
Hey, where-where you going?

01:53.015 --> 01:54.682
You took it too far, John.

01:55.718 --> 01:58.186
Bed-wetters.

02:02.691 --> 02:03.792
Here you go.

02:03.826 --> 02:05.026
They're lovely.

02:05.060 --> 02:07.529
Put them in water as soon
as you get home.

02:07.563 --> 02:09.464
I will, thank you.

02:11.300 --> 02:13.034
- See you next week, Tanya.
- Okay.

02:13.068 --> 02:15.270
Bye.

02:23.112 --> 02:24.779
What do you think you're...

02:25.815 --> 02:27.348
Take it. Take it, please.

02:56.745 --> 02:58.947
Surrender your weapon!

02:58.981 --> 03:00.782
Surrender your weapon!

03:00.816 --> 03:02.884
Surrender your weapon!

03:24.273 --> 03:27.675
No explosives,
no foreign objects.

03:27.710 --> 03:29.244
This is another service bot

03:29.278 --> 03:30.745
reprogrammed to commit a felony.

03:30.779 --> 03:33.114
Yeah, I get it, Sherlock.

03:33.148 --> 03:35.583
Lock up the scene, photograph
and bag the evidence.

03:35.618 --> 03:37.185
Routine procedure.

03:47.096 --> 03:48.263
Where's the file?

03:48.297 --> 03:50.598
Case number 45344.

03:50.633 --> 03:53.067
Make sure you tag it, too.

05:27.162 --> 05:28.262
How did you get in here?

05:28.297 --> 05:30.398
I've been in here
for a long time.

05:42.311 --> 05:44.145
It walked right to
that evidence crate

05:44.179 --> 05:45.947
like it knew where
it was going.

05:45.981 --> 05:47.782
Not like. It did.

05:47.816 --> 05:49.150
What do you guys got?

05:49.184 --> 05:50.785
Call came in at 2247.

05:50.819 --> 05:54.255
Multiple witnesses saw this
bot mug a woman at gunpoint.

05:54.289 --> 05:55.890
After she handed over her purse,

05:55.924 --> 05:57.825
it shot her point blank.

05:57.860 --> 05:59.627
Officers chased it
and destroyed it.

05:59.661 --> 06:00.928
At least, they
thought they did.

06:00.963 --> 06:02.397
We have a huge problem here.

06:02.431 --> 06:04.032
Can you bring up
a better angle?

06:05.634 --> 06:08.002
Anybody recognize that head?

06:09.405 --> 06:11.172
That's impossible.

06:11.206 --> 06:12.607
It can't be.

06:12.641 --> 06:14.342
- Are you sure?
- Positive.

06:14.376 --> 06:15.777
It's an XRN.

06:15.811 --> 06:17.011
What's it doing
in our evidence locker?

06:17.046 --> 06:18.046
I'm sorry, I don't follow.

06:18.080 --> 06:19.280
What is an XRN?

06:19.314 --> 06:20.915
- I thought we destroyed it.
- Destroyed what?

06:20.949 --> 06:22.350
The body was destroyed;
the head's been

06:22.384 --> 06:24.018
in our evidence locker
for two years.

06:24.053 --> 06:26.320
So someone programmed a bot
to commit a crime,

06:26.355 --> 06:28.456
get taken out, and end up
in our evidence locker

06:28.490 --> 06:29.690
to steal that head?

06:29.725 --> 06:32.260
Exactly. This was
no random crime.

06:33.328 --> 06:35.196
John, bring in Districts 14,

06:35.230 --> 06:36.531
15 and 18.

06:36.565 --> 06:38.299
Put BOLOs out to every
precinct in the city.

06:38.333 --> 06:40.568
Consolidate all drone
and sat surveillance.

06:40.602 --> 06:42.370
I want extra
security and patrols

06:42.404 --> 06:43.738
at all high-value targets.

06:43.772 --> 06:46.074
Insyndicate.
Insyndicate made a run

06:46.108 --> 06:47.675
on our evidence locker
a few months ago.

06:47.709 --> 06:49.343
I think this is what
they were after.

06:49.378 --> 06:51.312
What would Insyndicate
or anyone else want with it?

06:51.346 --> 06:53.414
I have no record of an XRN.

06:53.449 --> 06:55.483
An XRN with that much firepower
is nothing short of terrorism.

06:55.517 --> 06:57.952
The Wall.

06:59.354 --> 07:00.621
What about the Wall?

07:00.656 --> 07:02.256
If this is about terrorism,

07:02.291 --> 07:04.392
I can't think
of a better target.

07:04.426 --> 07:06.494
You think she would try
to create a breach

07:06.528 --> 07:07.829
between us and the other side?

07:07.863 --> 07:09.430
She's certainly got
enough firepower.

07:09.465 --> 07:10.998
Alert the watch
commander at the Wall.

07:11.033 --> 07:12.033
Tell them to be extra vigilant.

07:12.067 --> 07:13.601
I want her off the street.

07:15.871 --> 07:18.272
Captain, what the hell
is going on?

07:18.307 --> 07:20.441
Dorian,

07:20.476 --> 07:23.511
as long as she's out there, a
lot of people are gonna die.

07:38.067 --> 07:40.568
Hello.

07:40.603 --> 07:41.769
Where are you going?

07:53.015 --> 07:55.149
Whatever you're looking for
in those files,

07:55.184 --> 07:56.384
you won't find it.

07:56.418 --> 07:58.353
- They're mostly redacted.
- Why?

07:58.387 --> 08:01.055
Because it's an embarrassment
to the department.

08:01.090 --> 08:03.925
What happened that day, John?

08:03.959 --> 08:07.395
First of all, it
wasn't one day.

08:07.429 --> 08:10.198
It was three.

08:10.232 --> 08:12.500
You heard of a company
called Lumocorp?

08:12.534 --> 08:14.202
Yes. They made me.

08:14.236 --> 08:15.436
Well, then you know

08:15.471 --> 08:17.272
not long after
they were integrated

08:17.306 --> 08:19.173
into the police force, the DRNs

08:19.208 --> 08:20.975
began to malfunction.

08:21.010 --> 08:25.280
Their behavior became
unpredictable, erratic.

08:25.314 --> 08:26.881
Some of them even took
their own lives

08:26.916 --> 08:29.017
because they just couldn't cope
with what they saw.

08:29.051 --> 08:31.119
So you were all decommissioned

08:31.153 --> 08:34.621
and replaced by a
generic robot, the MXs.

08:34.657 --> 08:37.825
After Lumocorp's order
was canceled, overnight,

08:37.860 --> 08:39.994
they went from being one
of the most successful companies

08:40.029 --> 08:41.929
in the world
to a complete failure.

08:41.964 --> 08:43.597
So,

08:43.631 --> 08:46.034
faced with a mountain of debt
and a bunch of androids

08:46.068 --> 08:47.635
that nobody wanted,

08:47.670 --> 08:51.639
the guy who ran the company
came up with a new bot.

08:51.674 --> 08:52.974
The XRN.

08:53.008 --> 08:56.044
He designed it to be
more soldier than cop,

08:56.078 --> 09:00.081
and they had a big demo
for it downtown, Green Street.

09:00.115 --> 09:03.284
All the politicians were
there, power players.

09:05.587 --> 09:07.522
Let's just say

09:07.556 --> 09:09.857
it didn't go well.

09:09.892 --> 09:12.560
By the time my unit was
called in on the second day,

09:12.594 --> 09:14.963
they'd set up a triage
outside the building.

09:14.997 --> 09:18.533
Medics couldn't keep up
with the casualties.

09:18.567 --> 09:21.836
For 36 hours,

09:21.870 --> 09:24.572
we assaulted it with
everything we had.

09:24.606 --> 09:26.107
Armor-piercing rounds,

09:26.141 --> 09:28.576
light bombs, waves of MXs.

09:33.916 --> 09:36.484
26 cops went into
...and never came out alive...

09:36.518 --> 09:39.988
How many XRNs were there?

09:43.192 --> 09:44.692
On the third day,

09:44.727 --> 09:47.528
we finally cornered her
up on the top floor.

09:47.563 --> 09:50.031
We destroyed it.

09:50.065 --> 09:54.002
The only thing that
was left was its head.

09:54.036 --> 09:56.170
That head.

10:23.899 --> 10:25.967
Rudy, what have you got?

10:26.001 --> 10:27.235
Captain Maldonado sent me

10:27.269 --> 10:29.470
what was left of the bot
that walked out

10:29.505 --> 10:30.738
of your evidence locker.

10:30.773 --> 10:32.340
I got good and bad news.

10:32.374 --> 10:35.376
Bad news is, whoever
programmed it is talented.

10:35.411 --> 10:36.577
How talented?

10:36.612 --> 10:37.578
Well, the body was

10:37.613 --> 10:39.280
basically just an old scrap bot.

10:39.314 --> 10:41.416
There's nothing unique
or traceable

10:41.450 --> 10:42.750
about the materials used,

10:42.785 --> 10:44.052
but it's been ingeniously
modified.

10:44.086 --> 10:45.586
Modified?

10:45.621 --> 10:49.157
Yeah, it was designed with a
hidden secondary power source.

10:49.191 --> 10:51.092
The officers that took
the android out thought

10:51.126 --> 10:52.160
they'd destroyed it,

10:52.194 --> 10:53.761
but once it was booked
into evidence,

10:53.796 --> 10:55.530
that alternate power
activated, and, well,

10:55.564 --> 10:57.532
we all know what happened next.

10:57.566 --> 11:00.134
Do you have any idea who could
create such a thing?

11:00.169 --> 11:03.171
Uh, I don't know. I could make
a few calls, ask around.

11:03.205 --> 11:06.140
You said something
about good news.

11:06.175 --> 11:07.875
Um, yeah, that burning
was nothing.

11:07.910 --> 11:10.078
Uh, my test results
came back negative.

11:10.112 --> 11:11.913
Wait... how do you know
about that?

11:11.947 --> 11:13.347
About the case, Rudy.

11:13.382 --> 11:15.116
Yeah.

11:15.150 --> 11:16.384
Ah, yes, the good news,

11:16.418 --> 11:18.152
she may have
her own Achilles' heel.

11:18.187 --> 11:21.589
As I was saying, the materials
used to make the body

11:21.623 --> 11:23.458
are very crude,
and if it's running

11:23.492 --> 11:24.625
on a secondary power source,

11:24.660 --> 11:26.194
I'll wager
she won't get very far.

11:26.228 --> 11:28.029
She'll need a new body.

12:38.100 --> 12:39.767
Danica.

12:43.805 --> 12:45.239
<i>Attention, all units:</i>

12:45.274 --> 12:48.109
<i>target sighted in Section 43,</i>
<i>warehouse district.</i>

12:48.143 --> 12:50.678
Target has fled the scene.

12:50.712 --> 12:52.947
Victim is conscious,
minor lacerations.

12:56.351 --> 12:57.585
Detective Kennex.

12:57.619 --> 12:59.520
Thanks, Morris.

13:02.057 --> 13:05.193
The warehouse is
owned by a Nigel Bernard.

13:05.227 --> 13:08.129
The bot was here
when he got home.

13:08.163 --> 13:10.064
EMTs are with him now.

13:13.001 --> 13:15.403
Looks like it came
here to change bodies.

13:15.437 --> 13:17.605
What does this Bernard guy do?

13:17.639 --> 13:19.307
That's a good question.

13:22.444 --> 13:26.414
Whoever Dr. Bernard
is, that's not him.

13:26.448 --> 13:28.616
What do you mean?

13:28.650 --> 13:30.952
Do you know this guy?

13:34.156 --> 13:36.424
Excuse me.

13:43.865 --> 13:45.967
You're still a police officer.

13:46.001 --> 13:47.635
I am.

13:49.771 --> 13:52.373
They call me Dorian.

13:52.407 --> 13:56.844
Yes, of course they do.

14:00.048 --> 14:01.382
May I?

14:10.892 --> 14:12.693
I never thought that...

14:15.430 --> 14:18.232
Is there something I'm missing?

14:18.267 --> 14:19.600
Uh, forgive me.

14:19.635 --> 14:21.402
It's been quite a morning
for surprises.

14:21.436 --> 14:25.706
Detective John Kennex,
this is Dr. Nigel Vaughn.

14:25.741 --> 14:28.442
He created me.

14:28.477 --> 14:30.711
You're Nigel Vaughn?

14:30.746 --> 14:33.147
Dr. Nigel Vaughn,
founder of Lumocorp?

14:33.181 --> 14:35.983
Regrettably, I'm a very long way
from those days.

14:36.018 --> 14:36.984
You changed your name.

14:37.019 --> 14:39.654
Yes, I-I did.
How are you still on the force?

14:39.688 --> 14:40.655
I was recommissioned.

14:40.689 --> 14:42.723
- Are you the only one?
- Yes.

14:44.393 --> 14:47.862
I've missed you
so much, Dorian.

15:02.244 --> 15:04.211
Hey.

15:16.258 --> 15:18.626
Dr. Vaughn, what did
it want from you?

15:18.660 --> 15:19.727
Danica.

15:19.761 --> 15:21.395
Danica?

15:21.430 --> 15:24.031
- My prototype. That's what
I called her. - Right.

15:24.066 --> 15:25.399
So, uh, what did it want
from you?

15:25.434 --> 15:28.102
She wanted me
to take her to my lab.

15:28.136 --> 15:31.172
I told her I no longer have
a real lab.

15:31.206 --> 15:34.809
I lost my license
to practice robotics.

15:34.843 --> 15:37.078
She didn't take that very well.

15:37.112 --> 15:38.412
You know, for a guy

15:38.447 --> 15:40.581
who doesn't have
a license in robotics,

15:40.615 --> 15:42.383
you kind of got
a lot of robotics here.

15:42.417 --> 15:44.552
I just repair things now

15:44.586 --> 15:46.654
and I sell old parts
whenever I can.

15:46.688 --> 15:49.056
I mean, we all have
to eat, Detective.

15:50.826 --> 15:53.160
Why would she want to use your lab?

15:53.195 --> 15:55.730
- I don't know.
- You changed your name. You've...

15:55.764 --> 15:58.966
gone to extraordinary lengths
to keep a low profile,

15:59.000 --> 16:01.936
but somebody programmed
Danica's head to find you.

16:01.970 --> 16:05.005
- Do you have any idea who? - I've made a lot
of enemies since my botched demonstration

16:05.040 --> 16:08.142
on Green Street,
Detective. I'm...

16:08.176 --> 16:10.845
- sure you can well imagine. - Any
of them capable of building an android

16:10.879 --> 16:12.713
like the one that broke
into our evidence locker?

16:12.748 --> 16:13.881
- I don't know.
- Dr. Vaughn...

16:13.915 --> 16:16.217
Please, call me Nigel.

16:16.251 --> 16:19.086
Nigel, do you have any idea
where she's going?

16:19.121 --> 16:20.421
What she might need or want?

16:20.455 --> 16:22.690
No. No, I...

16:22.724 --> 16:25.226
You know, I went through
all of this two years ago.

16:25.260 --> 16:26.994
I don't know
what she wanted then,

16:27.028 --> 16:29.196
and I don't know
what she wants now.

16:29.231 --> 16:31.499
Danica was the greatest mistake
of my career,

16:31.533 --> 16:32.933
of my life.

16:32.968 --> 16:34.368
I take responsibility for that,

16:34.403 --> 16:37.938
but it's not my fault
that she got out.

16:37.973 --> 16:40.107
I don't know if you know what
it's like to be part of something

16:40.142 --> 16:43.077
that defines you forever
and in a way

16:43.111 --> 16:46.447
that you do not
wish to be defined.

16:46.481 --> 16:48.315
It's not easy. Everywhere I
went, people looked. They knew.

16:48.350 --> 16:50.084
They heard my name, they knew.

16:50.118 --> 16:52.586
"There goes that guy that
made that killer robot,

16:52.621 --> 16:55.623
that machine that
murdered all those people."

16:55.657 --> 16:57.825
I'm sorry.

16:59.995 --> 17:02.229
Well, thank you for your time.

17:02.264 --> 17:03.664
If you can think of
anything that'll help us

17:03.698 --> 17:06.200
in our investigation,
please give me a call.

17:06.233 --> 17:10.304
- Thanks again. - Nigel, I
know this is hard for you.

17:10.338 --> 17:12.606
It's not our past
that defines us.

17:12.641 --> 17:14.775
It's what we do now.

17:19.247 --> 17:22.383
There is a chance...

17:24.286 --> 17:26.720
a very small chance,

17:26.755 --> 17:29.457
that if I had some
of my old equipment back,

17:29.491 --> 17:31.826
I might be able to trace her.

17:38.758 --> 17:40.272
We're taking Vaughn and Rudy.

17:40.297 --> 17:41.213
<i>You think it'll work, John?</i>

17:41.248 --> 17:42.882
Look, we don't have a choice.
I need you to get

17:42.916 --> 17:45.184
a release order
for Dr. Vaughn's lab equipment.

17:45.218 --> 17:46.786
I've got a cop-killing android

17:46.820 --> 17:48.587
at large in my city,
with no clue what it wants

17:48.622 --> 17:51.223
or where to find it, and
your answer is lab equipment?

17:51.258 --> 17:55.061
- Vaughn says he can track it.
- Oh, whoa, I said I <i>think</i>

17:55.095 --> 17:57.697
- I can track her. - He
thinks he can track it.

17:57.731 --> 17:59.665
- I got the case files.
- Get an order to release it.

17:59.700 --> 18:01.534
Fast. We're on it.

18:16.416 --> 18:17.550
Who are you?

18:34.568 --> 18:38.237
Wow. Well, whose temple is this?

18:38.271 --> 18:41.107
Mine... Y-Your Highness.

18:41.141 --> 18:42.508
Uh, Dr. Rudolph Lom,

18:42.542 --> 18:44.744
- at your service.
- Um,

18:44.778 --> 18:46.312
I'm Nigel. Um, you may,

18:46.346 --> 18:48.647
uh, rise.

18:48.682 --> 18:50.382
You've been such an inspiration.

18:50.417 --> 18:52.485
Th-The DRNs are simply
amazing, Well...

18:52.519 --> 18:55.354
the greatest robotic, uh,
achievement of our generation,

18:55.388 --> 18:57.189
uh, in my humble opinion.

18:57.224 --> 18:58.858
Well, um, thank you, Rudolph,
for saying that.

18:58.892 --> 19:00.826
Watching you work even
from afar was like

19:00.861 --> 19:04.196
glimpsing Michelangelo
at the peak of his talents.

19:04.231 --> 19:06.065
Your hands are instruments

19:06.099 --> 19:08.934
of innovation. They should be...
they should be bronzed.

19:10.003 --> 19:11.604
Do you mind if I see them?
Uh...

19:11.638 --> 19:12.605
Sorry. I...

19:12.639 --> 19:13.606
I don't mean to gush.

19:13.640 --> 19:15.107
I'm just a big fan.

19:15.142 --> 19:17.076
Uh, thank you. I should have you
talk to my ex-wife.

19:17.110 --> 19:18.677
Oh, I'd be happy
to give her a call.

19:18.712 --> 19:21.213
- It would be an honor...
- I was... joking.

19:21.248 --> 19:23.783
Oh, yeah. So am I.

19:24.718 --> 19:26.619
We were... sharing a moment.

19:28.922 --> 19:30.589
So what are
we looking for here, Doc?

19:30.624 --> 19:33.225
Ah. A, um,
silver case,

19:33.260 --> 19:36.829
and it'll be marked 10-68.
The contents <i>may...</i>

19:36.863 --> 19:41.567
give us the ability to track
Danica, and I emphasize "may."

19:41.601 --> 19:43.536
After we find her, what then?

19:43.570 --> 19:46.272
Well, hopefully, we'll be able
to shut her down peacefully

19:46.306 --> 19:47.740
and avoid any further bloodshed.

19:47.774 --> 19:49.074
That's a pretty big "if."

19:49.109 --> 19:50.609
Yes, I suppose it is.

19:50.644 --> 19:52.311
I think I
found something.

19:52.345 --> 19:54.280
Yes? May I see?

20:03.223 --> 20:04.523
What are these?

20:04.558 --> 20:08.427
My greatest achievement.

20:11.498 --> 20:13.666
It's what makes you

20:13.700 --> 20:15.701
you.

20:19.539 --> 20:22.474
Synthetic souls.

20:23.543 --> 20:25.044
So you're to blame.
No,

20:25.078 --> 20:26.345
Detective, I can be blamed

20:26.379 --> 20:28.280
for many horrible things,

20:28.315 --> 20:31.684
but synthetic souls are not one
of those horrible things.

20:31.718 --> 20:33.319
May I ask what was

20:33.353 --> 20:35.087
your inspiration?
Ah.

20:35.121 --> 20:37.690
Well, I was trying
to capture the intangible.

20:37.724 --> 20:39.325
Y-You understand, of course,

20:39.359 --> 20:42.928
that DNA can be isolated under
a microscope. Uh, you know,

20:42.963 --> 20:44.763
hair color, eye color, height,

20:44.798 --> 20:47.800
weight, ethnicity...
the fundamental

20:47.834 --> 20:51.604
basic data can be traced
to individual chromosomes.

20:51.638 --> 20:55.307
But the soul...

20:55.342 --> 20:57.142
That is who we are.

20:57.177 --> 20:59.011
That is our passion.

20:59.045 --> 21:00.246
Our pain.

21:00.280 --> 21:02.314
It's why we laugh, why we cry,

21:02.349 --> 21:04.283
why we strive to be better.

21:04.317 --> 21:06.218
DNA, it's

21:06.253 --> 21:09.021
the-the data, but the soul...

21:09.055 --> 21:10.589
that's the story.

21:10.624 --> 21:13.359
That is the essence of life.

21:14.694 --> 21:16.762
I wanted to create life.

21:19.699 --> 21:21.600
What did you do...

21:21.635 --> 21:23.269
differently?

21:23.303 --> 21:24.470
With her

21:24.504 --> 21:26.305
synthetic soul?

21:26.339 --> 21:28.240
Just remember something:
you are not like her.

21:28.275 --> 21:29.508
Okay?

21:29.542 --> 21:31.810
I mean, the blueprint
is the same, but...

21:31.845 --> 21:33.445
How can you be sure?

21:33.480 --> 21:35.147
Some things

21:35.181 --> 21:37.549
I really wish
I'd have done differently.

21:40.921 --> 21:42.087
Kennex.

21:42.122 --> 21:43.088
It's me.

21:43.123 --> 21:44.690
What's up?

21:44.724 --> 21:46.525
I'm at a, uh, tech company
in the downtown core.

21:46.559 --> 21:48.460
Looks like your girl
came in swinging.

21:48.495 --> 21:50.696
She painted the walls
with a lab assistant,

21:50.730 --> 21:53.232
and she massacred
a bunch of other employees

21:53.266 --> 21:54.633
just to get into the clean room.

21:54.668 --> 21:56.068
What did it want in there?

21:56.102 --> 21:57.937
She stole 500, uh...

21:57.971 --> 22:00.439
"ZNA processing cores"?

22:00.473 --> 22:01.373
What are they?

22:01.408 --> 22:02.541
Like I know.

22:02.575 --> 22:03.776
Okay. Thanks.

22:03.810 --> 22:05.878
Your robot just broke into

22:05.912 --> 22:08.047
a company downtown,
killed a bunch of people,

22:08.081 --> 22:11.951
and stole some
ZNA processing cores.

22:11.985 --> 22:13.619
That mean anything to you?

22:13.653 --> 22:15.154
Well, I mean, they're...
they're processors.

22:15.188 --> 22:17.289
Every android has one.

22:17.324 --> 22:18.324
But those are very advanced.

22:18.358 --> 22:19.858
I mean, they're capable

22:19.893 --> 22:21.694
of a zeta-flop

22:21.728 --> 22:22.962
of parallel computations
per second.

22:22.996 --> 22:24.096
I don't know

22:24.130 --> 22:25.664
what that means, but, um...

22:25.699 --> 22:27.066
she stole 500 of them.

22:28.969 --> 22:31.603
- Why 500? 
- Simple math.

22:31.638 --> 22:33.238
One chip per android.

22:33.273 --> 22:34.974
With those processing cores,

22:35.008 --> 22:37.176
you'd be well on your way

22:37.210 --> 22:39.912
to conceivably making
500 Danicas.

22:41.448 --> 22:43.115
Someone's building androids.

22:52.505 --> 22:54.372
- You have a visitor. - Great.
I love visitors.

22:54.407 --> 22:55.707
He works in robotics

22:55.741 --> 22:57.381
for some big tech company.
Rudy called him.

22:57.410 --> 22:58.643
Thought he might
have some insight

22:58.678 --> 22:59.878
into whoever put this homicidal

22:59.912 --> 23:02.080
robot back onto the street.

23:02.115 --> 23:03.849
Where are you at
with Dr. Vaughn?

23:03.883 --> 23:05.684
He and Rudy are working on
the tracking software now.

23:05.718 --> 23:07.085
They need a little
bit more time

23:07.120 --> 23:09.654
- to attempt to locate Danica.
- Danica?

23:09.689 --> 23:11.656
That's what Dr. Frankenstein
called it.

23:11.691 --> 23:13.525
Cute.

23:15.461 --> 23:17.262
I'm Detective Kennex.

23:17.296 --> 23:19.231
This is my partner, Dorian.

23:19.265 --> 23:21.800
Luther Estes.
We're investigating

23:21.834 --> 23:24.035
a suspect with
a robotics background.

23:24.070 --> 23:27.772
Dr. Lom said that you may be
able to help us build a profile.

23:35.114 --> 23:36.882
This isn't a normal worker bot.

23:36.916 --> 23:38.216
These are cutting-edge designs.

23:38.251 --> 23:40.685
Some of these concepts are just

23:40.720 --> 23:42.754
being theorized
in the top robotic universities

23:42.788 --> 23:44.089
in the world.

23:44.123 --> 23:46.691
This bot has
palladium-encrusted circuits.

23:46.726 --> 23:50.028
They're hugely expensive
and extremely rare.

23:50.062 --> 23:51.463
But the work is raw.

23:51.497 --> 23:53.031
Someone who's not
beholden to conventions.

23:53.065 --> 23:55.767
Probably younger.

23:55.801 --> 23:58.403
Do you have any idea who might
be capable of this kind of work?

23:58.437 --> 24:01.840
There's a kid
in New Tokyo... Hikari.

24:01.874 --> 24:03.975
She'd be capable
of work like this.

24:04.010 --> 24:06.711
If it were someone local, I'd
have heard about them by now.

24:06.746 --> 24:08.446
What about someone
on the other side of the Wall?

24:08.481 --> 24:11.583
We have to consider
the possibility that

24:11.617 --> 24:13.251
the bot came from over there.

24:13.286 --> 24:14.986
What is that, a joke?

24:15.021 --> 24:18.123
Where would they
get the resources?

24:18.157 --> 24:22.127
Anyone this intelligent
would not still be on that side

24:22.161 --> 24:24.196
of the Wall.

24:24.230 --> 24:27.032
Not willingly, anyway.

24:27.066 --> 24:31.336
Here it is... it's our
best shot at finding Danica.

24:31.370 --> 24:33.838
Well, inside of this...

24:33.873 --> 24:36.174
is a unique signature,

24:36.209 --> 24:38.810
an energy specific to Danica.

24:38.844 --> 24:41.112
Once we isolate that signature,

24:41.147 --> 24:43.648
we can upload it
into your department's

24:43.683 --> 24:46.551
tracking system and,
theoretically,

24:46.586 --> 24:49.521
be able to track her, just
as you would any MX or android

24:49.555 --> 24:51.423
on your network.

24:52.792 --> 24:56.294
I don't think you understand
what you created.

24:57.196 --> 24:58.997
Pardon?
With Dorian.

24:59.031 --> 25:00.765
Your goal was to design androids

25:00.800 --> 25:02.534
to integrate
into the police force,

25:02.568 --> 25:04.803
but you created
so much more than that.

25:04.837 --> 25:07.806
Yes, well, I'm afraid the world
wasn't ready for a machine

25:07.840 --> 25:11.142
quite so evolved.

25:12.678 --> 25:14.679
I remember your trial.

25:14.714 --> 25:17.115
I felt badly for you.

25:17.149 --> 25:18.783
You were in the minority,
I'm afraid.

25:18.818 --> 25:21.353
The Synthetic Soul program
was ahead of its time.

25:21.387 --> 25:23.154
I don't know if
I'd have had the courage

25:23.189 --> 25:24.256
to push boundaries like you did.

25:24.290 --> 25:25.690
Perhaps your caution

25:25.725 --> 25:29.160
is why you still have
a lab and I don't.

25:30.229 --> 25:32.564
The DRNs were my life's work.

25:32.598 --> 25:35.133
Don't have any children.

25:35.167 --> 25:37.035
The love I felt for them...

25:37.069 --> 25:39.537
was not unlike a father's.

25:40.740 --> 25:43.108
And when they started
to malfunction,

25:43.142 --> 25:44.909
the powers that be
quietly decided

25:44.944 --> 25:47.078
in some back room that...

25:47.113 --> 25:49.214
the logic-based
MXs were...

25:49.248 --> 25:51.149
the better way to go.

25:51.183 --> 25:54.286
Didn't even give me an
opportunity to try and fix them.

25:54.320 --> 25:57.188
Uh, I work with MXs every day,
and let me tell you,

25:57.223 --> 25:58.890
they have their limitations.

25:58.924 --> 26:01.793
I mean, for a start, they
just stare at you with those...

26:01.827 --> 26:02.994
beady eyes.

26:03.029 --> 26:04.529
Look... they
don't even respond.

26:05.731 --> 26:07.198
Sorry, you were saying?

26:07.233 --> 26:08.867
Well, I had a...

26:08.901 --> 26:11.002
a second fleet of DRNs
already built,

26:11.037 --> 26:13.338
ready to be deployed,
when they pulled my contract.

26:15.141 --> 26:17.642
Then I was crushed
under a mountain of debt,

26:17.677 --> 26:19.744
lost everything...
my company...

26:19.779 --> 26:21.279
my reputation.

26:21.314 --> 26:23.014
Had to do something.

26:23.049 --> 26:25.116
Is that why you created her?

26:25.151 --> 26:26.584
Mm-hmm.

26:26.619 --> 26:28.987
Did you know what
she was capable of?

26:29.021 --> 26:31.056
No, I didn't predict
any of this.

26:31.090 --> 26:32.590
None of it.

26:32.625 --> 26:33.992
Although...

26:34.026 --> 26:36.695
you know, when I made
the DRNs, I was filled

26:36.729 --> 26:38.363
with a passion for my work

26:38.397 --> 26:41.366
and hope for where
we were going.

26:41.400 --> 26:43.568
When I made Danica...

26:43.602 --> 26:46.905
I was filled with resentment...

26:46.939 --> 26:48.773
desperation.

26:48.808 --> 26:51.409
I sometimes wonder if,
back then, something

26:51.444 --> 26:53.645
that was dark inside of me...

26:53.679 --> 26:55.947
got put in... her.

26:55.981 --> 26:58.049
I mean, we are...

26:58.084 --> 27:00.752
an integral part of our
creations, aren't we?

27:00.786 --> 27:02.754
But, you know, Danica is...

27:02.788 --> 27:04.055
is complex.

27:04.090 --> 27:06.825
Not just black and white
or good and evil.

27:06.859 --> 27:09.994
The world only saw
one part of her, and that,

27:10.029 --> 27:12.163
as they say, was that,
and I've been prevented

27:12.198 --> 27:14.299
from practicing robotics
ever since.

27:24.643 --> 27:26.177
You captured

27:26.212 --> 27:28.012
her energy signature.

27:28.047 --> 27:30.115
Let's go see if this works.

27:36.589 --> 27:38.423
Take us to 4th
and Caspar, now.

27:38.457 --> 27:41.092
This cab is off duty.
Your light was on.

27:41.127 --> 27:43.194
And your meter's still on.
Take us to 4th

27:43.229 --> 27:44.496
and Caspar <i>now.</i>

27:44.530 --> 27:46.297
I just said I'm off duty.

27:51.270 --> 27:53.872
I think you're very pretty.

27:56.175 --> 27:57.876
Let's go, honey.

28:07.520 --> 28:09.721
Just got to install
her frequency

28:09.755 --> 28:12.991
onto our tracking software.

28:16.629 --> 28:18.463
What's wrong with this?

28:18.497 --> 28:20.565
I don't know why
I can't get it up.

28:20.599 --> 28:23.067
I mean with her. I mean...
with her signal.

28:23.102 --> 28:25.637
<i>I</i> can get it up.
I have no problem

28:25.671 --> 28:27.939
in that department whatsoever.
I'm just... that's not...

28:27.973 --> 28:29.407
really an appropriate thing
to be talking about

28:29.442 --> 28:30.809
in the middle of an emergency

28:30.843 --> 28:32.277
with... you guys.

28:32.311 --> 28:34.646
I'll, uh... I'll
just keep working on this.

28:34.680 --> 28:37.215
Dr. Vaughn, is there anything
else that you require?

28:37.249 --> 28:39.184
Go away.

28:39.218 --> 28:41.486
What the hell is that?

28:41.520 --> 28:42.654
An EMP spike.

28:42.688 --> 28:44.856
If we set the
electromagnetic pulse

28:44.890 --> 28:47.158
to her frequency, we
should be able to disable her.

28:48.627 --> 28:51.729
That's her. It worked.

28:51.764 --> 28:54.299
Well done, Dr. Vaughn.
Where is she? Find out

28:54.333 --> 28:57.602
- what's in that area, Stahl. - She's
moving towards the northwest corner

28:57.636 --> 29:00.004
of 3rd and Main.
She's in a vehicle.

29:00.039 --> 29:02.373
- Looks like mostly retail and restaurants.
- If this is about

29:02.408 --> 29:03.374
stealing tech, why is she there?

29:03.409 --> 29:05.710
Track her signal
and send drones.

29:05.744 --> 29:08.480
- Doc? - Yeah, now, listen,
you need to get close enough

29:08.514 --> 29:10.448
to insert that.
It has to go

29:10.483 --> 29:12.617
precisely into
the back of her skull.

29:12.651 --> 29:14.385
The back of her skull?

29:14.420 --> 29:16.921
You're telling me to walk up
to a homicidal robot

29:16.956 --> 29:19.290
and stab it in the back
of the neck?

29:19.325 --> 29:20.391
Uh-huh.

29:20.426 --> 29:21.693
Great.

29:21.727 --> 29:23.962
Take as many available
MXs as you need.

29:23.996 --> 29:25.063
Great work.

29:25.097 --> 29:27.565
Uh, Dorian?

29:28.698 --> 29:30.535
Be careful.

30:09.557 --> 30:12.292
- How far out are we?
- Less than two minutes.

30:12.327 --> 30:15.495
She just went into a bar.
2720 3rd Street.

30:15.530 --> 30:18.665
Pull up the phone number.
Start evacuating the building.

30:18.700 --> 30:20.434
What the hell is
she doing in a bar?

30:20.468 --> 30:22.536
I just spoke to the
bar's corporate office.

30:22.570 --> 30:25.170
They're holding a reelection
fund-raiser for Councilman James Hart.

30:25.173 --> 30:26.907
They forwarded over
the guest list...

30:26.941 --> 30:28.842
it's a who's who of the
city's power players.

30:28.876 --> 30:30.210
Cross-reference the list...
see if anybody

30:30.245 --> 30:31.411
has any ties to robotics.

30:31.446 --> 30:32.546
I'm on it.

30:37.418 --> 30:39.786
Um... hi.

30:41.356 --> 30:43.123
Are you on the list?

30:46.728 --> 30:49.763
- Bar Luxon. Can I help you?
- This is the police. We need you

30:49.797 --> 30:51.598
to evacuate
the building as soon...

30:52.934 --> 30:54.334
Hello?

30:54.369 --> 30:55.869
Hello?

31:06.314 --> 31:07.347
Shots fired.

31:07.382 --> 31:09.716
We're hearing shots fired now.

31:09.751 --> 31:11.585
Paul's on his way
with reinforcements.

31:13.988 --> 31:15.622
Officer Kennex.

31:15.657 --> 31:17.658
The building has east and west
access on the first floor.

31:17.692 --> 31:19.760
Take a team
in the west entrance.

31:19.794 --> 31:21.928
I need a diversion.

31:21.963 --> 31:23.096
There's a fire escape
around the back.

31:23.131 --> 31:25.432
I'll evacuate people from there.

31:25.466 --> 31:26.900
Let's go, come with me!

31:26.934 --> 31:28.502
Move!

32:12.380 --> 32:14.348
We've lost all visuals!

32:14.382 --> 32:15.482
John, what's happening?

32:15.516 --> 32:16.650
Gorson is down.
Hernandez is down.

32:16.684 --> 32:18.618
We lost five MXs.

32:18.653 --> 32:19.986
Oh, my God.

32:20.021 --> 32:21.822
- You okay?
- This is happening again?

32:21.856 --> 32:23.023
It's not your fault.

32:23.057 --> 32:24.091
Dr. Vaughn,
maybe you should wait

32:24.125 --> 32:25.192
in the conference room.

32:25.226 --> 32:26.326
Huh? Yes.

32:33.735 --> 32:36.203
This better work.

32:51.419 --> 32:52.386
The E.M.P. didn't work!

32:52.420 --> 32:54.354
Get Dr. Vaughn!

32:57.825 --> 33:00.394
Where'd he go?

33:40.468 --> 33:42.469
Why are you doing this?

33:42.503 --> 33:46.440
Because my sacrifice
is necessary.

33:46.474 --> 33:47.641
Just like yours.

33:47.675 --> 33:49.643
We're nothing alike.

34:16.504 --> 34:18.605
Dorian!

34:26.605 --> 34:27.885
Dr. Vaughn's not
in the building!

34:27.909 --> 34:29.744
- What?
- He's gone.

34:29.777 --> 34:32.313
We have no feed.
I cannot see anything!

35:08.917 --> 35:10.151
What's so funny?

35:10.185 --> 35:12.353
I got the pin to your grenade.

35:36.078 --> 35:38.379
You okay?

35:39.915 --> 35:41.082
You?

35:41.116 --> 35:43.251
Ah...

35:43.285 --> 35:45.386
I'll be better.

35:48.790 --> 35:51.926
Better than a human leg, huh?

35:51.960 --> 35:54.161
Still anti-synthetic?

35:56.265 --> 35:58.332
It's growing on me.

36:20.422 --> 36:21.556
Kennex.

36:21.590 --> 36:22.890
John?

36:22.925 --> 36:23.891
Are you okay?

36:23.926 --> 36:24.926
Yeah, we're fine.

36:24.960 --> 36:26.894
Bot's destroyed.

36:26.929 --> 36:29.030
Tell Dr. Vaughn it's over.

36:29.064 --> 36:30.631
Dr. Vaughn is gone.

36:30.666 --> 36:32.166
Gone?

36:32.200 --> 36:34.569
Gone where?
We don't know.

36:34.603 --> 36:36.971
Captain?
We have a problem.

36:37.005 --> 36:40.675
I fully endorse replacing
the DRNs with MX androids.

36:40.709 --> 36:42.910
I think I know why they're
targeting Councilman Hart.

36:42.945 --> 36:44.546
Need to be lost
before we decommission

36:44.580 --> 36:48.149
these dangerous bots and end
this failed experiment?

36:48.183 --> 36:51.552
John, I'm telling
you, this is all a mistake.

36:51.587 --> 36:53.754
You've got it wrong,
Nigel wouldn't do this.

36:53.789 --> 36:55.957
Yeah? Then show me
those damn synthetic souls.

36:55.991 --> 36:58.893
I saw him put them away.
They're right here.

37:00.729 --> 37:03.297
Where?
They're gone.

37:28.323 --> 37:30.458
Drive.

37:35.998 --> 37:38.099
When the DRNs malfunctioned,

37:38.133 --> 37:40.201
Hart was the force
behind the recall.

37:40.235 --> 37:41.902
He voted to take away the city's

37:41.937 --> 37:45.139
DRN contract from Lumocorp
and awarded the new MX contract

37:45.173 --> 37:46.941
to Vaughn's competitor.

37:46.975 --> 37:49.577
It was one last "screw you"
to his competitors

37:49.611 --> 37:51.112
before he disappeared.

37:51.146 --> 37:52.947
The councilman's recovering
at Mercy General.

37:52.981 --> 37:55.416
I put a personal security
detail on him, just in case.

37:55.450 --> 38:00.655
- This wasn't about Councilman Hart.
- Yeah, Hart was just a bonus.

38:00.689 --> 38:02.423
This was about resources.

38:02.457 --> 38:04.125
Vaughn wanted
the microprocessors

38:04.159 --> 38:05.693
and the synthetic souls.

38:05.727 --> 38:07.628
Captain, there are
no sightings of Vaughn

38:07.663 --> 38:09.330
in District 7 or 8.
We put out BOLOs

38:09.364 --> 38:11.565
and assigned drones to the
airport, the monorail lines,

38:11.600 --> 38:13.067
and the ports.

38:13.101 --> 38:15.002
Any conceivable place he'd
think to exit the city from.

38:15.037 --> 38:17.304
But he didn't just disappear,
so keep looking.

38:24.813 --> 38:27.915
How's he handling this?

38:27.949 --> 38:30.885
Must be a hell of a
thing to meet your maker.

38:30.919 --> 38:33.721
But to be betrayed by him...

38:42.864 --> 38:44.999
You okay?

38:45.033 --> 38:48.269
He told me something
in the lab.

38:48.303 --> 38:50.337
What?

38:50.372 --> 38:53.074
I asked him what
he did differently

38:53.108 --> 38:55.876
with Danica's synthetic
soul than he did with mine.

38:58.046 --> 38:59.914
He said "nothing."

39:01.450 --> 39:03.551
She malfunctioned.

39:05.420 --> 39:09.090
She killed all
those people, John.

39:09.124 --> 39:11.559
You're afraid that's
gonna happen to you?

39:14.262 --> 39:18.099
How could the same man
that made her make me?

39:21.303 --> 39:24.805
- If she's capable of all
those things, I... - Dorian.

39:24.840 --> 39:26.240
You're not like her.

39:26.274 --> 39:28.476
And you're not like him.

39:28.510 --> 39:30.811
You're you.

39:30.846 --> 39:32.880
And nothing's
going to change that.

39:35.117 --> 39:37.752
Vaughn was in a different space
when he made her.

39:37.786 --> 39:39.453
He was desperate.

39:39.488 --> 39:43.491
He was losing his company, his
reputation, his lab, everything.

39:45.527 --> 39:46.894
What?

39:46.928 --> 39:48.763
His lab.

39:48.797 --> 39:53.367
Vaughn stole enough robotics
to build an army, man.

39:53.401 --> 39:55.936
He doesn't want to
hide away or disappear,

39:55.971 --> 39:59.006
he wants to work.

39:59.040 --> 40:01.075
He needs a new lab.

40:03.178 --> 40:04.845
- Captain.
- Yeah?

40:04.880 --> 40:07.014
Vaughn's not looking to run.
He needs a sanctuary.

40:07.048 --> 40:08.849
A place where he can work.
Someplace big enough

40:08.884 --> 40:10.684
for that kind of manufacturing,

40:10.719 --> 40:12.153
off the power grid.

40:12.187 --> 40:13.754
The abandoned shipyards
at the Old Port,

40:13.789 --> 40:15.389
that might be a place to start.

40:15.423 --> 40:17.258
What about the subway tunnels
that collapsed during

40:17.292 --> 40:18.492
the light bomb attack?
It's subterranean,

40:18.527 --> 40:20.594
it's out of sight of the drones.

40:20.629 --> 40:22.596
What about over the Wall?

40:24.466 --> 40:26.433
If you really didn't
want to be found...

40:26.468 --> 40:29.203
to disappear off every grid...

40:29.237 --> 40:31.105
that would be the place to go.

40:36.611 --> 40:40.414
I mean, Vaughn's crazy, but...

40:40.448 --> 40:42.149
not that crazy.

40:42.184 --> 40:43.617
I think John's right.

40:43.652 --> 40:45.319
I don't think he'd
go over the Wall.
