00:12.106 --> 00:14.436
Previously on 24:

00:15.550 --> 00:17.381
I´ll be right back.

00:22.100 --> 00:24.401
Renee!

00:26.004 --> 00:27.004
Oh, God...

00:30.375 --> 00:32.943
You said you had video file
implicating people inside

00:33.011 --> 00:34.978
the Russian government who were
responsible for Renee's murder.

00:35.046 --> 00:36.947
I want that file.

00:37.015 --> 00:38.582
<i>Tell me where that file is,</i>

00:38.650 --> 00:40.684
now! It's in a safety deposit box!

00:40.752 --> 00:41.652
Where?

00:41.653 --> 00:43.053
First Unity Savings.

00:43.054 --> 00:45.222
I had nothing to do with
Renee's death, Jack.

00:46.624 --> 00:47.957
No.

00:49.160 --> 00:52.296
You never give up, do you?

00:58.903 --> 01:00.404
Bauer may have Walsh,

01:00.471 --> 01:01.805
but he can't have the evidence yet.

01:01.806 --> 01:03.740
We've still got a
chance to stop him.

01:03.808 --> 01:05.742
<i>I'm not the only one who can prove</i>

01:05.810 --> 01:07.277
that elements in your government

01:07.278 --> 01:09.146
conspired to undermine
the peace process.

01:09.213 --> 01:11.048
So you expect me to
kill Bauer for you?

01:11.115 --> 01:14.051
You have the covert
assets here to do the job.

01:14.118 --> 01:15.786
Maybe I do.

01:15.853 --> 01:18.255
But I don't have the
resources to find him.

01:18.323 --> 01:19.389
CTU does.

01:19.390 --> 01:21.358
And the man in charge
of the search now

01:21.426 --> 01:22.893
reports to me.

01:22.961 --> 01:25.929
We got him.

01:25.997 --> 01:28.832
<i>Once they have Bauer, I'll find out
where they're holding him.</i>

01:28.900 --> 01:30.667
You'll have to take him
out while he's in custody.

01:30.735 --> 01:32.636
Freeze! Police!

01:32.704 --> 01:34.237
Do not move.

01:46.317 --> 01:47.884
Jack...

01:47.952 --> 01:49.453
tell me what I can do.

01:49.520 --> 01:51.154
Nothing.

02:14.946 --> 02:16.880
Mund, this is Captain Walleki.

02:16.948 --> 02:19.783
I'm on scene. You got that
guy from the bank yet?

02:19.851 --> 02:21.184
Just bringing him up, Captain.

02:21.185 --> 02:22.852
Right.

02:35.166 --> 02:37.267
It's Cole Ortiz.

02:37.335 --> 02:39.569
He says he's with CTU.

02:39.637 --> 02:42.305
You were with this
woman at the bank.

02:42.373 --> 02:44.441
Do you care to tell me who she is?

02:50.615 --> 02:52.549
Her name is Dana Walsh.

02:52.617 --> 02:53.950
Shot twice

02:53.951 --> 02:55.519
at close range-
lot of powder residue

02:55.586 --> 02:58.355
around one of the entries,
like an execution.

02:58.423 --> 03:01.091
Thank you, Mund.

03:01.159 --> 03:02.592
Get him to CTU,

03:02.593 --> 03:04.327
now.

03:19.944 --> 03:22.012
The hit on Hassan is all arranged.

03:22.080 --> 03:24.414
Bazhaev and his people are
taking care of everything.

03:24.482 --> 03:26.716
Well, I'm pleased to hear it,

03:26.784 --> 03:30.620
but you could have just as
easily called to tell me that.

03:30.688 --> 03:34.491
I wanted to know if you've
spoken to your superiors...

03:34.559 --> 03:37.961
told them that I'm out
after this goes down.

03:38.029 --> 03:40.831
I told them what you wanted.

03:40.898 --> 03:43.100
He feels the same as me:

03:43.167 --> 03:45.769
we have too much invested
in you to let you walk away.

03:45.837 --> 03:50.240
You should be focused on getting the E.
M.P. device into CTU,

03:50.308 --> 03:52.209
not on your boyfriend, Ortiz.

03:52.276 --> 03:55.979
He's my fiancÃ©, and I told
you to leave him out of this.

03:56.047 --> 04:01.017
I warned you to stay away from him,
but you didn't listen.

04:01.085 --> 04:04.621
And now you think you
have feelings for him?

04:04.689 --> 04:07.390
You think you love him,
going to marry him?

04:07.458 --> 04:09.459
Yes.

04:09.527 --> 04:11.261
I am.

04:11.329 --> 04:13.530
And if you have a problem

04:13.598 --> 04:16.333
wrapping your brain
around that fact,

04:16.399 --> 04:19.769
maybe I should talk to
your boss in Moscow.

04:19.837 --> 04:22.572
You talk to no one but me.

04:25.109 --> 04:26.877
We're done here.

04:26.944 --> 04:31.181
Don't contact me again
until Hassan is dead.

04:43.694 --> 04:45.195
Yeah?

04:45.263 --> 04:47.164
Hey, it's me. I sent you

04:47.231 --> 04:48.999
a DAT video file.

04:49.066 --> 04:50.967
Okay. I got it.

04:51.035 --> 04:53.036
It's uploading right now.

04:53.104 --> 04:55.839
Okay, I need you to get me an I.
D. of the man in the video.

04:55.907 --> 04:57.774
Also, I'm coming in hot,
so whatever you have to do

04:57.842 --> 04:59.509
to protect your systems from
getting flagged, do it now.

04:59.577 --> 05:01.077
What about the woman?
You need an I.D. on her?

05:01.145 --> 05:02.245
She's dead.

05:02.246 --> 05:03.880
I'll see you in a few minutes.

05:03.948 --> 05:06.349
All right.

05:06.417 --> 05:07.918
Jack Bauer's last known location

05:07.985 --> 05:10.053
was First Unity Savings
Bank on Lexington,

05:10.121 --> 05:11.354
where police responded

05:11.355 --> 05:13.557
to a 911 call,
apparently from Dana Walsh.

05:13.624 --> 05:15.025
She's dead now.

05:15.092 --> 05:16.326
Bauer killed her.

05:16.327 --> 05:17.527
Cole Ortiz,

05:17.528 --> 05:19.796
who is known to be
aiding and abetting Bauer

05:19.864 --> 05:21.298
is being brought
here for questioning.

05:21.365 --> 05:22.499
Now, I need everybody

05:22.500 --> 05:24.401
not committed to the U.
N. security task

05:24.468 --> 05:26.403
to devote their full
attention to finding him.

05:26.470 --> 05:29.406
I want all cameras routed
through facial recognition

05:29.473 --> 05:30.941
and all phone calls monitored.

05:31.008 --> 05:33.510
You don't have the bandwidth,
you steal it from other tasks.

05:33.578 --> 05:35.178
If you think you have a lead,

05:35.246 --> 05:37.047
you bring it to me immediately.

05:37.114 --> 05:40.083
Any questions?
Why did they go to the bank?

05:40.151 --> 05:42.085
Dana said she had evidence

05:42.153 --> 05:43.620
of Russian involvement
in Hassan's murder.

05:43.621 --> 05:45.255
Maybe that's where
she was stashing it.

05:45.323 --> 05:47.757
There's no evidence;
the president dismissed this.

05:47.825 --> 05:51.094
<i>Well, she went to the bank with
Jack to get something.</i>

05:51.162 --> 05:53.296
Yeah, what she got was
an explosive device

05:53.364 --> 05:54.731
that made possible her escape.

05:54.732 --> 05:56.199
It was her plan all along.

05:56.200 --> 05:58.101
Look, Jack Bauer
can't accept the fact

05:58.169 --> 06:00.036
that Dana Walsh was an enemy agent

06:00.104 --> 06:02.272
working solely with the I.
R.K. opposition

06:02.340 --> 06:03.740
to Hassan's government.

06:03.741 --> 06:07.577
His... grief over Renee
Walker's murder is causing him

06:07.645 --> 06:10.413
to create this fantasy
about a Russian conspiracy.

06:10.481 --> 06:13.049
The simple truth is, he's lost it,

06:13.117 --> 06:15.952
and he's a danger to
himself and the community.

06:16.020 --> 06:17.821
So let's stop second-guessing

06:17.888 --> 06:20.156
the operation, and find him.

06:27.431 --> 06:29.733
Something is seriously wrong here.

06:29.800 --> 06:31.268
Pillar's ignoring
the key questions,

06:31.335 --> 06:33.637
and the questions that he is
answering, no one's asking.

06:33.704 --> 06:35.005
What are you getting at?

06:35.006 --> 06:36.940
I think Jack's right:
this is a cover-up,

06:37.008 --> 06:38.174
and Pillar's involved.

06:38.175 --> 06:39.743
That evidence was at
the bank, and Jack

06:39.810 --> 06:41.011
has it. You don't know that.

06:41.012 --> 06:42.479
It's all speculation.

06:42.480 --> 06:45.148
It may be just like Pillar says.

06:45.216 --> 06:47.417
Until I know otherwise,
I got my orders.

06:49.687 --> 06:50.854
I'm clear.

06:50.855 --> 06:52.722
Well, you weren't kidding.

06:52.790 --> 06:55.325
You said you were coming in hot.

06:55.393 --> 06:57.360
All the police scanners
are talking about you.

06:57.428 --> 06:59.796
They said you shot and
killed some woman.

06:59.864 --> 07:01.998
Construction site on the East Side.

07:02.066 --> 07:03.633
Was that the same
woman in the video

07:03.701 --> 07:05.201
you sent me? Yeah.
Did you I.D. the man?

07:05.269 --> 07:08.071
No. I'm not going to, either...

07:08.139 --> 07:10.106
till you tell me what the hell

07:10.174 --> 07:12.075
is going on, Jack.
You saw the video.

07:12.143 --> 07:13.576
Dana Walsh is a Russian operative.

07:13.577 --> 07:14.811
She facilitated the assassination

07:14.812 --> 07:16.546
of President Hassan and
the dirty bomb attack

07:16.614 --> 07:18.848
that would have wiped out
the entire Upper West Side

07:18.916 --> 07:20.083
if we hadn't stopped it.

07:20.084 --> 07:22.018
I don't want to know about
what happened today,

07:22.086 --> 07:23.787
and I don't care; I want to know

07:23.854 --> 07:26.356
why you're out there on your own
and why everybody's after you.

07:26.424 --> 07:28.625
Because the president tried
to lock me down. Why?

07:28.693 --> 07:30.360
Because I know she's
trying to cover up

07:30.428 --> 07:32.362
the Russian's involvement
in today's attack.

07:32.430 --> 07:34.097
Then why didn't you disappear?

07:34.165 --> 07:35.798
Because I can't!

07:37.501 --> 07:40.170
Listen, I want to help you, Jack.

07:40.237 --> 07:41.471
I really do.

07:41.472 --> 07:43.606
I need you to be straight with me.

07:43.674 --> 07:46.076
Tell me exactly what's going on.

07:56.787 --> 07:59.856
The Russians took
something from me.

08:01.992 --> 08:04.494
Her name was Renee Walker.

08:05.763 --> 08:09.766
They killed her
inside my apartment.

08:09.834 --> 08:12.702
And I need to make them pay.

08:17.775 --> 08:19.675
All right.

08:21.379 --> 08:23.413
Actually, I did I.D. the guy.

08:26.283 --> 08:29.085
There he is: Pavel Tokarev.

08:31.122 --> 08:33.655
Primary operative,
Russian intelligence.

08:37.395 --> 08:39.328
Where is he?

08:39.397 --> 08:41.331
I don't know exactly.

08:41.399 --> 08:42.966
He's in the USA.

08:43.033 --> 08:45.435
Came in a month ago
on a diplomatic visa.

08:45.503 --> 08:48.104
Diplomat. I tried to access

08:48.172 --> 08:49.839
the Russian database
in the embassy.

08:49.907 --> 08:52.742
He didn't show up in the consulate.

08:52.810 --> 08:54.444
He could be anywhere, Jack.

08:54.512 --> 08:56.846
To keep everything quiet,
they'd have to be

08:56.914 --> 08:58.848
a small unit, right? Yeah.

08:58.916 --> 09:00.984
I think I've got an idea.

09:01.051 --> 09:02.819
Get me a secure line.

09:04.765 --> 09:07.652
Meredith. I didn't expect
you'd still be here.

09:07.687 --> 09:09.694
Oh, fact check called:
there are a few items

09:09.729 --> 09:10.860
left on the Hassan piece.

09:10.861 --> 09:12.762
Abby can follow up on it for you.

09:12.830 --> 09:16.466
I know. I just... I need
to make sure it's right.

09:16.534 --> 09:19.436
I know what he meant to you.

09:19.503 --> 09:21.871
It shows in this piece you wrote.

09:21.939 --> 09:24.007
What a great man he was.

09:24.074 --> 09:26.609
You've done him justice.

09:28.412 --> 09:30.213
I hope so.

09:30.281 --> 09:31.948
Miss Reed, there's a call for you

09:32.016 --> 09:33.950
on 3. Thank you.

09:34.018 --> 09:36.686
Let me know if there's
anything you need.

09:36.754 --> 09:38.387
Thanks, Gary.

09:49.418 --> 09:50.687
This is Meredith Reed.

09:50.688 --> 09:51.486
Miss Reed.

09:51.487 --> 09:53.002
Who is this? My name is Jack Bauer.

09:53.070 --> 09:55.037
Please don't say anything;
just listen.

09:55.105 --> 09:56.739
The people that you
think are responsible

09:56.807 --> 09:58.674
for killing President Hassan
were not working alone.

09:58.742 --> 10:00.143
They were being funded and managed

10:00.210 --> 10:01.911
by people working inside
the Russian government.

10:01.979 --> 10:03.913
How do you know this?

10:03.981 --> 10:05.848
I have proof of this: a
video file that was made

10:05.916 --> 10:07.383
by a Russian agent
working out of CTU.

10:07.384 --> 10:08.818
She made it for her own protection.

10:08.819 --> 10:10.453
It explains everything that
happened in the last 24 hours.

10:10.521 --> 10:12.155
Have you contacted the
authorities about any of this?

10:12.222 --> 10:13.456
I can't.

10:13.457 --> 10:15.625
I'm being set up,
just like you were yesterday.

10:15.692 --> 10:17.593
I need to get this evidence to you.

10:17.661 --> 10:18.928
There's a coffee stand

10:18.929 --> 10:20.163
on the third floor of
Turner's Department Store.

10:20.164 --> 10:22.932
Do you think you get there
in the next 20 minutes?

10:23.000 --> 10:24.634
Miss Reed...

10:24.701 --> 10:26.836
yesterday I helped clear your name.

10:26.904 --> 10:29.639
Right now I need you
to help clear mine.

10:29.706 --> 10:30.907
Please.

10:30.908 --> 10:33.176
Of course I'll help you.

10:33.243 --> 10:36.012
I- I want to know the
truth as much as you do.

10:36.079 --> 10:37.613
Thank you.

10:52.129 --> 10:53.929
Thank you.

10:58.235 --> 10:59.902
Take a seat.

11:05.943 --> 11:07.376
Where's Bauer?

11:07.377 --> 11:09.412
I don't know.

11:09.479 --> 11:11.547
You're in some trouble here, Cole.

11:11.615 --> 11:12.949
I assume you're aware of that.

11:12.950 --> 11:15.117
Luckily for you,

11:15.185 --> 11:17.186
I'm in a position to
make all that go away.

11:17.254 --> 11:18.888
I reviewed your record.

11:18.956 --> 11:21.357
You've had a exemplary
career up to now.

11:21.425 --> 11:23.926
You're Pillar.

11:23.994 --> 11:25.461
That's right.

11:25.529 --> 11:26.729
Jason Pillar.

11:26.730 --> 11:27.964
I've been asked by the president

11:27.965 --> 11:30.099
to oversee the effort
to retrieve Jack Bauer.

11:30.167 --> 11:31.534
Madam President?

11:31.535 --> 11:33.236
Yes.

11:33.303 --> 11:34.871
So you're a part of the cover-up?

11:38.742 --> 11:40.676
Oh, I see here you
served in Fallujah.

11:40.744 --> 11:41.844
I- I spent two tours

11:41.845 --> 11:45.248
in command of a marine
unit in Baquba myself.

11:45.315 --> 11:47.817
We're both soldiers.

11:49.519 --> 11:52.021
So you understand,
when the commander-in-chief deems

11:52.089 --> 11:54.190
a course of action necessary
to the national good,

11:54.258 --> 11:57.226
it's not our place to question it.

11:57.294 --> 11:58.494
The truth is:

11:58.495 --> 12:00.062
we're on the same side.

12:00.130 --> 12:02.365
We both want what's
best for our country.

12:02.432 --> 12:03.799
Bauer doesn't care about that.

12:03.800 --> 12:05.701
He didn't give a damn about
what happened to you,

12:05.769 --> 12:07.970
just as long as it
served his needs.

12:08.038 --> 12:09.671
He used you.

12:11.608 --> 12:14.010
So let's start over.

12:15.979 --> 12:17.613
Do you know where Jack Bauer is?

12:21.118 --> 12:22.718
Probably somewhere with
the evidence you guys

12:22.786 --> 12:25.855
keep saying doesn't exist.

12:25.923 --> 12:27.790
You really don't want
to be playing with me.

12:30.394 --> 12:32.328
What?

12:32.396 --> 12:34.263
Good news: we may
have a line on Bauer.

12:34.331 --> 12:36.966
We intercepted a call.

12:39.369 --> 12:41.470
Last chance.

12:41.538 --> 12:42.972
You don't take it, there's nothing

12:43.040 --> 12:45.541
anyone can do for you.

12:54.718 --> 12:56.719
Take him to holding.

12:58.689 --> 13:00.623
Arlo got a cell phone
intercept report

13:00.691 --> 13:02.158
off of NSA's Echelon.

13:02.159 --> 13:04.593
Hassan, Russian government,
Jack Bauer.

13:04.661 --> 13:07.196
Did Arlo hear any of the conversation? No,
not yet - all he's got

13:07.264 --> 13:08.497
so far are the data handles,

13:08.498 --> 13:09.332
but he's processing
the voice matrix now.

13:09.333 --> 13:10.499
Are we sure it's Bauer?

13:10.500 --> 13:12.902
No, not yet, but the
other side of the call

13:12.970 --> 13:14.603
was a phone registered
to Meredith Reed.

13:14.671 --> 13:16.672
She's the reporter CTU
arrested last night

13:16.740 --> 13:18.541
before the first attempt
on Hassan's life.

13:18.608 --> 13:20.176
Rumor has it she was
also his mistress.

13:20.243 --> 13:21.310
If Bauer was going to reach out

13:21.311 --> 13:22.345
to someone with the evidence,

13:22.346 --> 13:23.779
she would be an excellent choice.

13:23.847 --> 13:24.880
Arlo, stop what you're doing.

13:24.881 --> 13:26.048
Tag and lock the intercept download

13:26.049 --> 13:27.483
and send it directly
to Eden's system.

13:27.551 --> 13:29.656
She'll take it from there.
That's not necessary, sir.

13:29.691 --> 13:31.745
I said I want Eden to handle it.
Thanks, Arlo.

13:56.183 --> 13:57.416
There's a video file that was made

13:57.417 --> 13:59.051
by a Russian agent
working out of CTU.

13:59.119 --> 14:00.553
She made it for her own protection.

14:00.554 --> 14:03.155
It explains everything that
happened in the last 24 hours.

14:03.223 --> 14:04.957
Have you contacted the
authorities about any of this?

14:05.025 --> 14:07.426
I can't. I'm being set up
just like you were yesterday.

14:07.494 --> 14:09.205
I need to get this evidence to you.

14:09.240 --> 14:10.614
There's a coffee stand

14:10.615 --> 14:12.421
on the third floor of
Turner's Department Store.

14:12.456 --> 14:13.599
Do you think you can get
there in the next 20 minutes?

14:13.600 --> 14:14.600
Jack Bauer.

14:14.601 --> 14:15.601
PILLAR Yes, sir.

14:15.602 --> 14:16.769
We confirmed the voiceprint.

14:16.770 --> 14:18.504
So...

14:18.572 --> 14:21.707
take it to the press-
that's his next move.

14:21.775 --> 14:22.841
It appears to be.

14:22.842 --> 14:24.109
Reed's connection to Hassan means

14:24.110 --> 14:25.211
she'd be highly motivated

14:25.212 --> 14:26.679
to help him.

14:26.746 --> 14:28.547
And he hasn't shown
her anything yet?

14:28.615 --> 14:30.049
No, sir. Which still means

14:30.050 --> 14:32.484
that we, we don't know what
the evidence actually is.

14:32.552 --> 14:35.020
Well, it will be in
our hands soon enough.

14:35.088 --> 14:37.022
This is a major opportunity

14:37.090 --> 14:38.657
to make everything go away, sir:

14:38.725 --> 14:39.858
Bauer and the evidence.

14:39.859 --> 14:40.859
I've already dispatched

14:40.860 --> 14:42.461
the Russian ops team
to the location.

14:42.529 --> 14:44.096
They'll be in position
well before the meet.

14:44.164 --> 14:45.197
You need to deal

14:45.198 --> 14:46.198
with local law enforcement,

14:46.199 --> 14:48.133
make sure Pavel has room to move.

14:48.201 --> 14:50.369
Yes, we're deploying
NYPD away from the site,

14:50.437 --> 14:51.470
but we'll still need your guys

14:51.471 --> 14:52.738
in and out as quickly as possible.

14:52.739 --> 14:53.973
Understood.

14:53.974 --> 14:57.009
Jason, this is, this is a
major break you've got,

14:57.077 --> 14:58.577
<i>a major break.</i>

14:58.645 --> 15:00.512
Thank you, sir.

15:00.580 --> 15:02.681
We'll shut this down.

15:02.749 --> 15:05.484
I want to stay on top of
this personally, Mikhail.

15:05.552 --> 15:09.088
So will you let me
have Pavel's number?

15:16.496 --> 15:18.764
Can you make this room less public?

15:27.574 --> 15:29.508
You wanted me for something?

15:29.576 --> 15:31.143
Yeah, the call you intercepted-

15:31.211 --> 15:32.645
the one that Pillar hijacked-

15:32.646 --> 15:33.712
do you think it was from Jack?

15:33.713 --> 15:35.047
I can't be sure.

15:35.048 --> 15:36.949
The program hit on keywords Hassan,
nuclear, Bauer,

15:37.017 --> 15:38.584
but all three have been in the news

15:38.652 --> 15:39.852
in the last few hours.

15:39.853 --> 15:41.553
But the call was to
Meredith Reed's cell phone.

15:41.621 --> 15:43.922
She's a journalist with an
interest in the Hassan story.

15:43.990 --> 15:46.258
Plenty of people
could be calling her.

15:46.326 --> 15:47.760
Doesn't have to be Jack.

15:47.761 --> 15:49.628
Okay, then explain this.

15:49.696 --> 15:51.196
Cell intercept
report comes in here.

15:51.264 --> 15:52.631
Two minutes later

15:52.632 --> 15:54.099
Pillar downloads the
entire conversation

15:54.167 --> 15:55.701
into a segregated server surrounded

15:55.769 --> 15:57.136
by firewalls like I've never seen.

15:57.137 --> 15:58.804
Then what does he do?

15:58.872 --> 16:00.539
Call one, call two,

16:00.607 --> 16:01.974
call three.

16:01.975 --> 16:03.275
Who'd he call?

16:03.276 --> 16:04.677
I don't know.

16:04.744 --> 16:06.945
They're outside of CTU and
they're all completely masked.

16:07.013 --> 16:09.281
So the question is this:
if the call was nothing,

16:09.349 --> 16:10.783
then why are they still hiding it?

16:10.784 --> 16:12.818
If the call was Jack,
then why haven't they dispatched

16:12.886 --> 16:14.386
CTU SWAT team?

16:14.454 --> 16:17.256
Why haven't they alerted NYPD?

16:17.324 --> 16:18.657
Arlo,

16:18.658 --> 16:19.925
they're in on the cover-up.

16:19.926 --> 16:21.626
Look at them.

16:27.367 --> 16:28.967
Why? Why would they
want to do that?

16:29.035 --> 16:30.469
Because he knows too much.

16:30.470 --> 16:31.937
He's gotten a hold
of Dana's evidence,

16:31.938 --> 16:33.339
which proves the
Russian involvement

16:33.340 --> 16:34.473
in Hassan's assassination.

16:34.474 --> 16:36.275
They can't let him
go public with that.

16:36.343 --> 16:37.976
That's why I have to find him,

16:38.044 --> 16:40.179
and I need your help.

16:45.518 --> 16:48.120
Okay.

16:48.188 --> 16:50.989
How do you want to do it?

16:51.057 --> 16:52.324
I'm gonna talk to Cole.

16:52.325 --> 16:54.026
He just spent the past two
hours with Jack and Dana.

16:54.094 --> 16:56.462
He must have some idea
of what Jack's up to.

16:56.529 --> 16:58.130
Pillar's got Cole
continuously monitored.

16:58.198 --> 16:59.765
You can't get in there
without being seen.

16:59.833 --> 17:03.335
We'll create a loop and graft
it into the security feed.

17:03.403 --> 17:04.770
That's the other problem:

17:04.771 --> 17:07.205
they added an extra layer
of oversight to our system.

17:07.272 --> 17:09.174
Second I try to move beyond
my security clearance,

17:09.242 --> 17:10.943
I get an on-screen warning.

17:11.010 --> 17:13.612
They're watching
everything we're doing.

17:13.680 --> 17:15.681
Okay, fine.

17:22.355 --> 17:25.324
We'll use this,
create a mobile hot spot.

17:25.392 --> 17:28.660
That way we can work off
our own net without Pillar

17:28.728 --> 17:30.229
breathing down our necks.

17:30.296 --> 17:32.364
Got it.

17:36.136 --> 17:37.970
Setting up alternate network

17:38.037 --> 17:40.806
now.

17:45.211 --> 17:46.578
We're up.

17:46.579 --> 17:47.579
Okay, I'm restricting access

17:47.580 --> 17:49.481
to you and me.

17:49.549 --> 17:52.584
How long will it take
you to make the loop?

17:52.652 --> 17:53.919
I can only give you 90 seconds.

17:53.920 --> 17:55.287
Anything more than that,
somebody will notice.

17:55.288 --> 17:57.656
Okay, text me when you're set up.

18:14.140 --> 18:17.176
* *

18:28.555 --> 18:30.622
Fredericks,

18:30.690 --> 18:31.824
McDermott was injured
in the E.M.P. blast,

18:31.825 --> 18:32.825
so I need you to collect

18:32.826 --> 18:33.959
the night shift time cards

18:33.960 --> 18:35.194
and take them to my office.

18:35.195 --> 18:36.829
Okay.

18:36.896 --> 18:38.297
Like now?

18:38.364 --> 18:41.200
Yes, ma'am.

18:57.116 --> 18:58.717
We put a loop in the security feed.

18:58.785 --> 18:59.918
I've only got 90 seconds,

18:59.919 --> 19:01.487
so I'm gonna get
straight to the point.

19:01.554 --> 19:02.955
I need to find Jack

19:03.022 --> 19:04.823
or else they're gonna kill him.
Who's gonna kill him?

19:04.891 --> 19:06.458
Pillar and whoever
is working with him.

19:06.526 --> 19:08.093
You need to tell me where he is.

19:08.161 --> 19:09.561
I got no idea.

19:09.562 --> 19:11.129
You were at the bank with him;
he must have said something.

19:11.197 --> 19:13.098
Hey, what Jack says
and what he does

19:13.166 --> 19:14.633
are two very different things.

19:14.701 --> 19:15.968
He's trying to expose the cover-up.

19:15.969 --> 19:18.303
He doesn't give a damn
about any cover-up.

19:18.371 --> 19:21.840
He's taking out anyone who was
anywhere near Renee's death,

19:21.908 --> 19:23.675
starting with Dana.

19:23.743 --> 19:26.645
She gave him the evidence
and he killed her anyway.

19:26.713 --> 19:28.680
She took the gun out of
the safety deposit box.

19:28.748 --> 19:29.748
She was probably shooting at him.

19:29.749 --> 19:32.150
He shot her point-blank.

19:32.218 --> 19:35.721
He executed her,
just like she said he would.

19:35.788 --> 19:38.657
There e no good guys here.

19:38.725 --> 19:42.794
Jack, Pillar... they end
up killing each other,

19:42.862 --> 19:44.663
maybe it's the best thing.

19:44.731 --> 19:45.964
No, Jack's my friend.

19:45.965 --> 19:48.033
If I can find him,
I can talk him down.

19:48.101 --> 19:50.202
These people are just
going to kill him.

19:50.270 --> 19:51.837
I need you to be on my side.

19:53.139 --> 19:54.706
Everybody wants me on their side.

19:54.774 --> 19:57.409
Who am I fighting for?

19:57.477 --> 20:02.114
If we can get to him,
we can expose the cover-up.

20:05.718 --> 20:07.119
You just stay here and
feel sorry for yourself.

20:07.186 --> 20:09.121
I'm gonna go find him.

20:09.188 --> 20:11.156
Wait.

20:14.360 --> 20:16.762
Look, it's not much, but Jack's
got to be working with someone.

20:16.829 --> 20:17.963
Who?

20:17.964 --> 20:19.131
I don't know; I never saw him,

20:19.132 --> 20:20.499
but Jack showed up
with state-of-the-art

20:20.500 --> 20:22.234
weapons and comms,
so he's got to have

20:22.302 --> 20:23.569
a contact in the city.

20:23.570 --> 20:26.371
You want to find Jack,
you find his supplier.

20:26.439 --> 20:27.939
Thanks.

20:33.546 --> 20:34.546
Arlo.

20:34.547 --> 20:36.281
You got out in time. You okay?

20:36.349 --> 20:38.350
Yeah, I'm okay. Listen,
I know what Jack's doing.

20:38.418 --> 20:40.953
Pull up his files, get me the
list of his known associates

20:41.020 --> 20:43.488
in the tri-state area,
anyone he's worked with in the past.

20:43.556 --> 20:44.556
Okay.

20:44.557 --> 20:45.591
In the next half hour,

20:45.592 --> 20:47.559
the man who has widely
been acknowledged

20:47.627 --> 20:50.295
as the vital "third partner"
in the peace process-

20:50.363 --> 20:52.497
Russian President Yuri Suvarov-

20:52.565 --> 20:54.333
will touch down at JFK.

20:54.400 --> 20:56.368
He'll be ferried into
Manhattan by helicopter

20:56.436 --> 20:58.437
and then to the U.N.

21:13.753 --> 21:15.687
Yes.

21:15.755 --> 21:17.823
Pavel, update, please.

21:17.890 --> 21:19.992
My team is in position.

21:20.059 --> 21:22.127
Any sign of Bauer?

21:22.195 --> 21:24.529
Not yet.

21:24.597 --> 21:26.698
I need to know.

21:26.766 --> 21:29.801
What about the woman?

21:29.869 --> 21:31.069
The woman?

21:31.070 --> 21:35.207
The journalist, her disposition.

21:35.274 --> 21:37.776
Ms. Reed is aiding and
abetting a terrorist.

21:37.844 --> 21:40.479
She's a serious threat
to both our countries.

21:40.546 --> 21:42.381
Do what you have to.

22:15.983 --> 22:18.482
I see from Ethan's notes
that we still have not

22:18.517 --> 22:20.981
completely resolved the
issue of site access

22:21.016 --> 22:22.566
for the inspection teams.

22:22.601 --> 22:24.117
I believe it was resolved.

22:24.215 --> 22:25.350
President Hassan agreed

22:25.351 --> 22:27.453
the inspectors would have
right of passage over

22:27.488 --> 22:28.968
our entire country.

22:29.003 --> 22:30.622
But he exempted schools.

22:30.657 --> 22:32.242
Only primary schools.

22:32.724 --> 22:34.157
Omar didn't think

22:34.158 --> 22:37.260
ten-year-old children would
be building nuclear missiles.

22:40.498 --> 22:43.000
Of course. I remember now.

22:43.067 --> 22:44.834
I- I do apologize.

22:46.237 --> 22:48.639
Are you all right, Madam President?

22:49.974 --> 22:51.942
It's been a long day.

22:52.010 --> 22:53.477
I'm fine. Thank you.

22:53.544 --> 22:56.847
Madam President.

23:00.418 --> 23:01.985
If you'll excuse me

23:02.053 --> 23:04.354
for a few minutes,
there's someone I need to see.

23:04.422 --> 23:06.390
Of course.

23:06.457 --> 23:07.624
Where is he?

23:07.625 --> 23:09.126
He's in the conference room, ma'am.

23:18.369 --> 23:20.203
Thank you for seeing me,
Madam President.

23:20.271 --> 23:21.338
I have good news.

23:21.339 --> 23:22.572
We've located Bauer.

23:22.573 --> 23:24.007
He-He has the evidence, but...

23:24.008 --> 23:25.609
Charles, you assured me

23:25.677 --> 23:26.843
that that wouldn't happen.

23:26.844 --> 23:28.045
Please, let me finish.

23:28.046 --> 23:31.448
We know exactly where Bauer will be

23:31.516 --> 23:33.517
and when, and-and we have
an operation underway

23:33.584 --> 23:35.519
to reacquire him even as we speak.

23:35.586 --> 23:38.355
<i>Believe me, this is good news.</i>

23:40.825 --> 23:43.627
Let me know as soon
as it's resolved.

23:43.695 --> 23:46.063
I need to get back
to the negotiations.

23:46.130 --> 23:48.632
Just... There's just one thing,
Madam President.

23:48.700 --> 23:54.137
Uh, we are three hours away
from the signing of the treaty.

23:54.205 --> 23:56.506
Isn't it time

23:56.574 --> 23:58.341
for my role in the process

23:58.409 --> 24:01.178
to be officially recognized?

24:01.245 --> 24:03.213
I was thinking

24:03.281 --> 24:05.549
some kind of, uh, announcement

24:05.616 --> 24:08.518
to the media, perhaps
by your press secretary,

24:08.586 --> 24:10.954
or maybe even by you yourself,
Madam President.

24:13.591 --> 24:16.093
It was, you'll recall,
our agreement

24:16.160 --> 24:18.095
that I would have a public face

24:18.162 --> 24:20.097
on this historic day.

24:22.266 --> 24:25.068
I believe I've earned it.

24:29.440 --> 24:32.409
I will talk to my press secretary.

24:32.477 --> 24:34.678
She will make the announcement

24:34.746 --> 24:36.913
in time for the 1:00 o'clock news.

24:36.981 --> 24:38.982
Thank you very much,
Madam President.

24:55.500 --> 24:57.367
We have contact.

24:57.435 --> 24:59.302
Target heading to the
third floor escalator.

24:59.370 --> 25:01.071
Acknowledged.

25:01.139 --> 25:04.074
I see her now.

25:04.142 --> 25:06.243
We have eyes on Reed.

25:10.515 --> 25:13.583
Reed is confirmed.

25:13.651 --> 25:16.253
Units 2 and 3,
Reed is approaching you.

25:16.320 --> 25:18.321
Confirm contact.

25:19.824 --> 25:21.758
Reed confirmed.

25:21.826 --> 25:23.727
Approaching the meeting place.

25:23.795 --> 25:25.162
Any sign

25:25.163 --> 25:26.997
of Bauer? Where is he?

25:27.064 --> 25:28.765
He should be here.

25:28.833 --> 25:30.333
No sign.

25:37.074 --> 25:39.409
Pavel, do you see Bauer?

25:39.477 --> 25:41.144
Not yet.

25:41.212 --> 25:43.747
Unit 1,

25:43.815 --> 25:45.148
report.

25:45.149 --> 25:47.150
We have no visual of Bauer.

25:58.930 --> 26:01.531
Jason, where are you going?

26:01.599 --> 26:03.466
There he is.
He's heading up towards...

26:03.534 --> 26:04.701
Damn it, I lost him.

26:04.702 --> 26:05.869
All units,

26:05.870 --> 26:09.339
Bauer is on the third floor.
Do you see him?

26:09.407 --> 26:10.740
I do not have him. What?

26:10.741 --> 26:12.776
He's there. We see him.
Get your eyes open, damn it!

26:12.844 --> 26:14.778
I have not seen him.

26:14.846 --> 26:16.279
Got him.

26:16.347 --> 26:18.381
Bauer is approaching the
target from the southwest.

26:18.449 --> 26:20.217
He's got a brown leather
jacket and jeans.

26:23.421 --> 26:25.689
There he is.

26:25.756 --> 26:27.390
Pavel,

26:27.458 --> 26:28.592
he's in view.

26:28.593 --> 26:29.926
He's closing in on the cafÃ©.

26:29.927 --> 26:31.862
You should have a
clean line on him.

26:37.735 --> 26:39.669
Pavel, if you have a shot, take it.

26:39.737 --> 26:41.238
I've got him.

26:44.709 --> 26:46.542
Put it down.

26:49.547 --> 26:52.682
Everything's all clear
up at the top, Jack.

26:52.750 --> 26:54.818
Got her. Come with me.

26:54.886 --> 26:56.786
Do exactly what I say. Okay.

26:58.422 --> 27:00.857
All units, target is in the open.
Take him out.

27:00.925 --> 27:03.226
I repeat: take him out.

27:09.133 --> 27:10.567
You stay down here.
You don't move. Oh, okay.

27:10.635 --> 27:12.135
Don't move! All right.

27:32.957 --> 27:34.357
Move!

27:34.358 --> 27:35.926
Okay.

27:35.993 --> 27:38.395
What the hell just happened?

27:38.462 --> 27:41.898
He knew it was a trap.

27:41.966 --> 27:44.467
Don't let them out of your sight.

27:44.535 --> 27:45.735
We lost him.

27:45.736 --> 27:48.471
Just keep looking!

27:48.539 --> 27:50.974
- Those people you shot
- who were they?

27:51.042 --> 27:52.542
Russian operatives.
You have any problems?

27:52.610 --> 27:54.444
No.

27:56.681 --> 27:58.682
Let's go.

28:21.748 --> 28:23.415
Jason. Tell me.

28:23.483 --> 28:26.051
I'm afraid I have bad news, sir.

28:26.119 --> 28:30.589
All of Pavel's team is dead,
and Bauer has Pavel.

28:30.657 --> 28:32.591
He was ahead of us
from the get-go, sir.

28:32.659 --> 28:34.326
He must have anticipated
that we'd use Echelon,

28:34.394 --> 28:37.262
and he put out a series
of keywords, knowing

28:37.330 --> 28:38.797
the listening stations
would pick them up.

28:38.865 --> 28:40.332
He played us, sir.

28:40.333 --> 28:42.668
He knew we'd use off-book
resources to deal with him.

28:42.736 --> 28:44.703
He used that journalist
to draw them out.

28:44.771 --> 28:48.340
Now, sir, I hardly need to
tell you that the situation

28:48.408 --> 28:49.575
is grave.

28:49.576 --> 28:51.477
Pavel knows everything.

28:51.544 --> 28:53.612
He ran Walsh;
he set up the Russian ops.

28:53.680 --> 28:56.281
If Bauer gets Pavel to talk...

28:56.349 --> 28:59.752
But at the moment, sir,

28:59.819 --> 29:02.554
you still have
complete deniability.

29:02.622 --> 29:04.656
President Taylor made
all the decisions.

29:05.992 --> 29:07.493
I think the time has come

29:07.560 --> 29:10.496
for you to distance
yourself from this mess.

29:10.563 --> 29:12.498
It's regrettable, sir, deeply so,

29:12.565 --> 29:14.733
but I believe it's
what's best for you.

29:14.801 --> 29:16.802
You...

29:17.804 --> 29:19.905
20 minutes from now,

29:19.973 --> 29:21.907
the president's press secretary

29:21.975 --> 29:23.675
is going to make an announcement.

29:23.743 --> 29:25.411
She will say

29:25.478 --> 29:27.513
I have become part of
the president's team,

29:27.580 --> 29:29.448
and-and I have been indispensable

29:29.516 --> 29:30.983
in bringing this peace process

29:30.984 --> 29:32.151
to a successful close.

29:32.152 --> 29:34.586
Sir, may I say that
that is a bad idea?

29:34.654 --> 29:36.055
You need to distance yourself.

29:36.122 --> 29:37.956
What? You keep using that phrase.

29:38.024 --> 29:39.625
What-What does
distance myself mean?

29:39.692 --> 29:41.160
Do I just slink away?

29:41.227 --> 29:42.594
This isn't your fault, sir.

29:42.595 --> 29:43.996
There were circumstances we
couldn't have anticipated.

29:43.997 --> 29:45.564
Namely Bauer.

29:45.632 --> 29:47.966
Well, then, we find Bauer,
and we neutralize him.

29:48.034 --> 29:49.735
We're public now,

29:49.803 --> 29:51.503
Jason.

29:51.571 --> 29:53.372
We're committed.

29:53.440 --> 29:54.840
And I have worked...

29:54.841 --> 29:56.942
<i>We...</i>

29:57.010 --> 29:59.278
<i>We have worked too hard</i>

29:59.345 --> 30:01.113
just to throw this all away.

30:01.181 --> 30:02.347
Do you understand?

30:02.348 --> 30:03.515
Yes, of course, sir, but Pavel...

30:03.516 --> 30:04.783
No.

30:04.784 --> 30:06.552
Pavel is a good soldier.

30:06.619 --> 30:07.920
He won't talk,

30:07.921 --> 30:10.856
whatever Bauer does to him.

30:10.924 --> 30:12.858
I, uh...

30:12.926 --> 30:15.294
I put you at CTU, Jason,

30:15.361 --> 30:16.662
for a reason.

30:16.663 --> 30:18.564
They have huge resources.

30:18.631 --> 30:20.399
You have intelligence and tenacity.

30:20.467 --> 30:24.036
You use those capabilities.

30:24.104 --> 30:26.038
Find Bauer.

30:26.106 --> 30:27.306
Yes, sir.

30:27.307 --> 30:29.074
I'll head down to the scene myself.

30:29.142 --> 30:31.543
Good.

30:31.611 --> 30:33.612
Keep me posted.

30:36.816 --> 30:38.784
He wants to move forward.

30:38.852 --> 30:41.086
Does he understand
what actually happened?

30:41.154 --> 30:44.323
Yes, but he says we
still have options.

30:48.061 --> 30:50.329
I need to know you're
with me on this.

30:52.398 --> 30:54.066
Yes. Yes, I'm with you.

30:54.134 --> 30:55.567
Good. I'm heading out.

30:55.568 --> 30:58.270
I'll clean up the scene,
remove all trace of the Russians,

30:58.338 --> 30:59.638
and get on Bauer's trail.

30:59.639 --> 31:01.740
I'll take CTU SWAT with me.

31:01.808 --> 31:03.909
Tell NYPD to put a two-block
perimeter around the store.

31:03.977 --> 31:05.511
No one goes in or out
without my say-so.

31:05.578 --> 31:07.070
What reason do I give them?
National security.

31:07.105 --> 31:10.249
Anyone gives you a hard time,
invoke the White House.

31:16.856 --> 31:18.624
Any luck with Jack's associates?

31:18.691 --> 31:20.492
No. Even discounting dead people,

31:20.560 --> 31:21.760
and people from foreign countries,

31:21.761 --> 31:23.195
it's still going to take hours.

31:23.196 --> 31:24.663
I think I can narrow it down.

31:24.731 --> 31:26.198
I just picked up a 911 call

31:26.266 --> 31:27.799
from Turner's in Midtown.

31:27.867 --> 31:29.134
There was a oot-out,

31:29.135 --> 31:30.402
people killed.

31:30.403 --> 31:32.771
I managed to get into the
store's security system.

31:34.307 --> 31:35.974
Oh, my God.

31:37.977 --> 31:39.378
That's Jack.

31:40.980 --> 31:42.147
They're trying to kill him.

31:42.148 --> 31:43.515
Yeah, that part of the plan

31:43.516 --> 31:44.683
didn't go so well.

31:44.684 --> 31:46.518
I tagged the footage
15 minutes before

31:46.586 --> 31:47.886
to 15 minutes after the shooting.

31:47.887 --> 31:50.122
If we run facial recognition
on the camera feeds...

31:50.190 --> 31:52.724
We can match it to the
database of Jack's associates,

31:52.792 --> 31:55.027
maybe find out who
he's working with.

31:55.094 --> 31:56.495
Thanks, Arlo.

31:56.563 --> 31:58.664
No problem.

31:58.731 --> 32:00.098
Copy the camera
footage to my screen.

32:00.099 --> 32:01.966
I'll send you half
the personnel files.

32:06.906 --> 32:09.241
We're clear. Let's go.

32:15.615 --> 32:17.416
Let's go.

32:19.619 --> 32:20.886
Where are we going?

32:20.887 --> 32:22.888
Over here.

32:36.502 --> 32:38.036
Empty your pockets right now here.

32:39.272 --> 32:41.139
We'll be safe here for a while.

32:51.517 --> 32:53.452
Jack? We don't have much time.

32:58.691 --> 33:00.025
Take off your coat.

33:00.026 --> 33:01.526
Now!

33:04.330 --> 33:06.765
Those people you killed...

33:06.833 --> 33:09.167
you were ready for them,
weren't you?

33:09.235 --> 33:10.569
You knew they were coming.

33:10.570 --> 33:11.603
Yeah.

33:11.604 --> 33:12.971
So you...

33:12.972 --> 33:15.674
you knew they'd be listening
to our phone call.

33:15.742 --> 33:18.543
Isn't that right?

33:18.611 --> 33:21.613
You used me to draw them out,

33:21.681 --> 33:22.914
right?

33:22.915 --> 33:24.249
That's right.

33:24.250 --> 33:25.984
I could have been
killed back there!

33:26.052 --> 33:27.586
You weren't.

33:30.423 --> 33:32.391
Now, pick it up.

33:32.458 --> 33:34.059
I said pick it up!

33:34.127 --> 33:36.228
What about the evidence
you said you'd tell me?

33:36.296 --> 33:37.862
Was that a lie, too?

33:39.499 --> 33:41.232
No.

33:43.036 --> 33:46.305
The evidence is on
this memory card.

33:46.372 --> 33:50.142
When you see it,
you'll know it's real.

33:50.209 --> 33:51.876
Take it.

33:53.046 --> 33:56.248
My partner's gonna take you
somewhere to show it to you.

33:56.316 --> 34:00.052
I'm sorry things had
to play out like this.

34:00.119 --> 34:02.254
I didn't see another choice.

34:04.123 --> 34:06.024
What are you gonna do?

34:06.092 --> 34:08.592
Put your hands behind
your back. Now!

34:08.661 --> 34:10.929
Don't do this, please.
You don't want to do this. Take her

34:10.996 --> 34:12.697
to the storeroom.

34:12.764 --> 34:14.199
No, I'm not going anywhere.

34:14.199 --> 34:16.068
Please, you cannot do this.

34:16.135 --> 34:17.569
The evidence I gave you

34:17.637 --> 34:19.071
doesn't tell me how
Walsh was involved.

34:19.138 --> 34:20.906
He will.

34:20.973 --> 34:22.139
Come on. No.

34:22.141 --> 34:23.342
He's a human being!

34:23.342 --> 34:25.610
You cannot do this this way!

34:28.481 --> 34:29.981
Sit over there.

34:38.958 --> 34:41.460
Springfield, M1A rifle.

34:43.596 --> 34:45.664
.308 round.

34:50.536 --> 34:53.304
You know, about four hours ago,

34:53.373 --> 34:56.641
I had a friend of mine-
very good friend-

34:56.708 --> 35:00.412
named Renee Walker was killed
by a rifle just like that.

35:00.480 --> 35:02.247
Go to hell.

35:09.389 --> 35:11.857
You first.

35:23.833 --> 35:26.268
DANA The hit on Hassan
is all arranged.

35:26.336 --> 35:27.436
Bazhaev and his people

35:27.437 --> 35:29.638
are taking care of everything.

35:29.706 --> 35:32.641
You talko no one but me.

35:32.709 --> 35:34.609
We're done here.

35:34.677 --> 35:37.512
Don't contact me again until Hassan

35:37.580 --> 35:39.715
is dead.

35:46.656 --> 35:49.624
To be honest with you,

35:49.692 --> 35:53.495
Renee Walker was more
than just my friend.

35:53.563 --> 35:56.331
But you already know that,
don't you?

35:56.399 --> 36:00.268
Because you saw us in the
bedroom of my apartment.

36:00.336 --> 36:04.773
Now, you're either not
very good at what you do...

36:04.841 --> 36:07.008
or you wanted her to suffer.

36:07.076 --> 36:09.378
Because with that
rifle from that range,

36:09.445 --> 36:11.413
it was an easy kill shot.

36:11.481 --> 36:12.881
But instead,

36:12.882 --> 36:14.583
you shot her...

36:14.650 --> 36:16.084
right there...

36:16.152 --> 36:18.320
two inches below her heart,

36:18.388 --> 36:20.455
so she would bleed out slowly.

36:20.523 --> 36:21.957
I watched her

36:21.958 --> 36:23.992
gasping for air...

36:24.060 --> 36:26.795
as the blood slowly
filled her lungs.

36:26.863 --> 36:28.463
She died in agony,

36:28.531 --> 36:30.899
which is exactly what
I'm gonna make you do

36:30.967 --> 36:33.802
unless you tell me
what I want to know.

36:45.681 --> 36:48.283
Start talking to me!

36:50.253 --> 36:53.021
You want to know I
killed your girlfriend?

36:55.525 --> 36:57.192
I killed her.

36:57.260 --> 36:58.860
I kill your bitch!

36:58.928 --> 36:59.895
I did it!

37:05.301 --> 37:08.570
Please... please,
you've got to stop him. Please.

37:08.638 --> 37:10.939
He needs answers,
and he's gonna get 'em.

37:11.007 --> 37:12.541
I can use this.
There's enough here.

37:12.608 --> 37:14.276
I don't need any more.

37:14.343 --> 37:15.710
Tell him I don't need
any more. Please.

37:15.711 --> 37:17.112
You're not going anywhere.

37:35.798 --> 37:37.398
Let's go.

37:43.539 --> 37:45.841
Move aside. Move. Move.

37:45.908 --> 37:47.709
Please step back from the bodies.

37:47.777 --> 37:48.944
This is now

37:48.945 --> 37:50.245
a CTU crime scene.

37:50.246 --> 37:51.446
I need all weapons

37:51.447 --> 37:53.215
and documents you
found on these people.

37:53.282 --> 37:54.816
This is all we got, sir.

37:54.884 --> 37:56.751
None of them had I.D.s on them.

38:02.692 --> 38:05.160
This is the man we're looking for.

38:05.228 --> 38:06.628
His name is

38:06.629 --> 38:08.530
Jack Bauer. Now,
you need to spread out

38:08.598 --> 38:09.731
and check every floor

38:09.732 --> 38:11.166
and every exit.

38:11.167 --> 38:14.669
He has a hostage with him,
so he won't have gotten far.

38:14.737 --> 38:16.438
Bauer's armed and
extremely dangerous,

38:16.506 --> 38:18.306
so if you don't want to
end up like these people,

38:18.374 --> 38:20.141
shoot on sight.

38:20.209 --> 38:22.511
Let's go.

38:31.554 --> 38:33.455
Hey.

38:36.225 --> 38:38.894
So, why don't we start this again.

38:40.396 --> 38:43.899
I already know that you
killed Renee Walker.

38:43.966 --> 38:46.635
What I want to know...

38:46.702 --> 38:48.103
is the name...

38:48.170 --> 38:49.871
of the Russian pig

38:49.939 --> 38:51.773
inside your government

38:52.909 --> 38:55.076
...that gave the order.

38:56.445 --> 38:59.814
Give me a name,
and I'll end this quickly.

38:59.882 --> 39:01.483
I give you my word.

39:17.333 --> 39:19.768
You think you know about pain?

39:20.970 --> 39:23.204
You don't know anything yet.

39:26.542 --> 39:28.276
Give me the name of the person

39:28.344 --> 39:30.111
inside your government

39:30.179 --> 39:32.113
who wanted Renee Walker dead!

39:32.181 --> 39:33.848
Give me the name!

39:35.318 --> 39:37.319
Who gave the order?!

39:37.386 --> 39:39.254
Who inside your government

39:39.322 --> 39:40.689
wanted Renee Walker dead?

39:40.690 --> 39:43.625
All you got to do
is give me the name!

39:57.940 --> 40:00.508
You are so stupid.

40:00.576 --> 40:02.177
Renee Walker wasn't

40:02.244 --> 40:03.511
a threat to you.

40:03.512 --> 40:05.847
Her work was finished.
She was done. We were out.

40:05.915 --> 40:09.884
All you had to do
is leave us alone.

40:11.921 --> 40:15.690
Now, why couldn't you
just leave us alone?

40:19.562 --> 40:21.329
I want the name of the person

40:21.397 --> 40:23.832
who gave the order
to pull the trigger!

40:25.735 --> 40:27.369
Who gave the order?!

40:27.436 --> 40:28.603
Now!

40:28.604 --> 40:30.138
Did it on my own!

40:30.206 --> 40:32.273
You're lying. You're nothing.

40:32.341 --> 40:34.376
You didn't have the authority.

40:34.443 --> 40:36.144
I want the name!

40:36.212 --> 40:37.278
Give me the name!

40:37.279 --> 40:39.214
My name is Pavel Tokarev.

40:56.332 --> 40:58.299
This isn't working.

40:58.367 --> 41:00.368
Damn it!

41:10.880 --> 41:13.581
Where's the SIM
card for your phone?

41:15.785 --> 41:17.318
Where's the SIM card?!

41:21.090 --> 41:24.059
Where'd you drop it?

41:35.971 --> 41:38.506
You dumb bastard, you swallowed it.

41:38.574 --> 41:40.208
You swallowed it.

41:41.677 --> 41:44.546
This is for my friend.

41:52.221 --> 41:54.989
* *

42:00.629 --> 42:01.930
What do you got?

42:01.931 --> 42:03.098
Fine. There's another
service hallway.

42:03.099 --> 42:04.566
Check all the service
hallways over there.

42:04.567 --> 42:06.034
Make sure they're locked down.

42:06.102 --> 42:09.003
You guys, I want you to go up there,
stay on the third floor.

42:09.071 --> 42:10.938
Do it now.

42:54.750 --> 42:57.886
You've reached the mobile number
of President Charles Logan.

42:57.953 --> 42:59.554
We can't take your call right now,

42:59.622 --> 43:01.055
but if you leave a message,

43:01.123 --> 43:03.892
we'll get back to you
as soon as we can.
