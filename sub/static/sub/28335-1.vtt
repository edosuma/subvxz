02:06.632 --> 02:11.881
I'm gonna throw some fresh lines at you from
a little poem I am working on right now.

02:13.193 --> 02:14.664
Last night...

02:15.880 --> 02:17.862
when I went to bed in Havana,

02:17.864 --> 02:20.296
<i>I was thinking about you,</i>

02:21.384 --> 02:22.729
<i>I was thinking about you.</i>

02:24.584 --> 02:29.222
And I got up about 4:00 a.m.,
and I had to take a piss, as guys do,

02:29.224 --> 02:31.048
and I looked down at my dick.

02:32.617 --> 02:36.296
And I had such affection
in my heart when I did...

02:37.993 --> 02:42.054
knowing that it had been
inside you twice today...

02:46.376 --> 02:50.281
...made me feel... beautiful.

02:52.649 --> 02:56.006
That's what I got. Have a great night.

Before I accept whatever award
they're giving me today,

04:36.872 --> 04:38.951
I'll start with a little bit
of poetic foreplay.

04:38.953 --> 04:41.416
I wrote this
in the wilds of Kentucky.

04:41.833 --> 04:44.135
I didn't have peach fuzz
over my pecker at the time.

04:44.137 --> 04:48.486
I was surrounded by inbreds,
rednecks, juveniles, limp dicks.

04:48.488 --> 04:51.431
All that time, I was 14,
it's a little poem I wrote,

04:51.433 --> 04:57.224
that I was always like to read first because
it takes me back to such a pure place.

04:58.057 --> 05:01.033
Okay...

05:02.216 --> 05:05.094
One day,
I will swallow up the world...

05:08.552 --> 05:11.687
And when I do,
I hope you all perish violently.

05:14.281 --> 05:17.094

05:47.465 --> 05:49.638
It's boring here without you.

05:49.640 --> 05:51.335
<i>I know, right?

05:51.337 --> 05:54.889
I need you back here in Miami.

06:01.705 --> 06:03.815
Heather and I need you
to come back home.

06:03.817 --> 06:07.590
Ah, you know my home is down here
in the Keys with all the burn-outs.

06:07.592 --> 06:10.919
I'm a bottom feeder. I got to go
low to get high. You know that.

06:10.921 --> 06:14.343
No. It's here and we have so many
friends and guess who's coming?

06:14.345 --> 06:16.902
They're your friends.
I don't have any friends.

06:16.904 --> 06:19.974
Yes, you do. Well, at least
they pretend to be your friends.

06:19.976 --> 06:22.758
<i>You know what?

06:22.760 --> 06:26.150
- <i>Moondog, what it do?</i>
- <i>Is that the Lounger, one and only?</i>

06:26.152 --> 06:29.543
You already know it, man. I just stopped by
to drop off some roses to your lovely wife.

06:29.545 --> 06:31.590
To keep it pushing,
you understand, boss?

06:31.592 --> 06:35.015
I wish you could see Heather.
My goodness, she is just glowing...

06:35.017 --> 06:37.033
- Glowing?
- ...about the wedding, baby.

06:38.153 --> 06:39.303
Why is she glowing?

06:39.305 --> 06:41.159
Because she's so in love.

06:41.161 --> 06:43.849
Ah! Shit,
you scared me for a minute.

06:44.617 --> 06:46.439
But what does she
know about love, anyway?

06:46.441 --> 06:48.359
She's 16 years old.
She doesn't know what love is.

06:48.361 --> 06:51.462
- She's too young to get married.
- She's 22, Moondog.

06:51.464 --> 06:53.543
Ah, 22, whatever.

06:53.545 --> 06:56.327
I mean, besides,
she's marrying such a limp dick.

06:56.329 --> 06:59.303

09:18.024 --> 09:21.158

09:27.113 --> 09:28.201

09:28.712 --> 09:31.432

- Oh, honey.

09:32.072 --> 09:34.278
Oh...

09:34.280 --> 09:35.464
Oh!

09:36.584 --> 09:39.815
- Look at you.
- No, you've been gone too long.

09:39.817 --> 09:42.119
- Look at you.
- You have to woo me.

09:42.121 --> 09:44.104
Woo-woo-doo, did you miss me?

10:08.425 --> 10:09.416
Oh, my God.

10:11.048 --> 10:13.064
I forgot how rich we were.

10:13.768 --> 10:15.817
Yeah. You did forget, Moondog.

10:19.496 --> 10:20.840
I missed all ten of you.

10:27.464 --> 10:29.417
Mmm.

10:31.016 --> 10:33.126
Oh, that's so good. Oh, God.

10:33.128 --> 10:35.271
You're never going
to write that new book, honey.

10:35.273 --> 10:37.862
- I'm having lunch with my agent today.
- Oh, God!

10:37.864 --> 10:40.582
We will be going over the new book.
It is not written yet.

10:40.584 --> 10:42.119
Of course not.

10:42.121 --> 10:44.103
I think this is going
to be a big one, baby.

10:46.312 --> 10:48.390
Well, make sure
it doesn't take too long.

10:48.392 --> 10:50.727
I want everything to go perfectly
for Heather's wedding today.

10:50.729 --> 10:54.215
I'm so fucking on time.
I'm the last guy you gotta worry about.

10:54.217 --> 10:57.287
No, sweetie, seriously,
you cannot be late.

10:57.289 --> 11:00.263
Okay?
Because you just can't.

11:00.265 --> 11:02.279
- Okay.
- I'm not going to be late, sweetie.

11:02.281 --> 11:05.704
I forgot to tell you that I
invited your mother to the wedding.

11:07.016 --> 11:09.671
Oh, Heather is not wearing
the white dress.

11:09.673 --> 11:12.839
She's going with the
oyster one with the pearls.

11:12.841 --> 11:16.551
Oh, you can go, Akiko.

11:16.553 --> 11:19.142
- Thank you, ma'am.
- That's right. Right there, honey.

11:19.144 --> 11:21.798
Oh, Moondog!

11:21.800 --> 11:24.198
It's so nice of Ray to let us
have the wedding at his place.

11:24.200 --> 11:26.055
He's really pulled out
all the stops.

11:26.057 --> 11:27.335
Lingerie Doggy Dog?

11:27.337 --> 11:29.670
He got ordained
just for the event.

11:29.672 --> 11:31.110
Dearly beloved.

11:31.112 --> 11:33.063
No, I wouldn't say that shit
like that.

11:33.065 --> 11:34.825
Players and playettes.

11:35.720 --> 11:40.679
Today, we have this man
coming for this woman.

11:40.681 --> 11:43.206
Bitch, you know you're too young
to be married, right?

11:43.208 --> 11:45.193
You got a lot of livin' to do,
baby.

11:45.961 --> 11:48.870
Ain't nobody made your little
pink twitter squirt yet, huh?

11:48.872 --> 11:51.752
You need to settle down somewhere
and run for the motherfucking hills.

11:52.297 --> 11:54.408
Shit, I got sidetracked
for a minute.

11:56.137 --> 11:57.735
Putt!

11:57.737 --> 12:00.294
It breaks my heart, Moondog,
breaks my heart,

12:00.296 --> 12:02.214
'cause you
a motherfucking has-been, boy.

12:02.216 --> 12:04.230
Whatever the fuck that is.

12:04.232 --> 12:07.142
- Is that a bad thing?
- Goddamn it's a bad thing, Moondog.

12:07.144 --> 12:10.535
As your forever agent, I feel obliged
to be truthful with you at all times.

12:10.537 --> 12:12.935
- You're a shitty agent.
- It's sad, Moondog.

12:12.937 --> 12:15.303
You used to be a motherfucking
ATM for me, boy.

12:15.305 --> 12:20.999
You have pissed away your talent on
women and booze and total excess.

12:21.001 --> 12:22.695
Now you're talking.

12:22.697 --> 12:24.774
Yeah, all those things,
that's what feeds the juices

12:24.776 --> 12:27.495
up here my nugget, man,
through my loins up the Autobahn,

12:27.497 --> 12:29.126
my spirit and mind, man.

12:29.128 --> 12:32.102
I'm... I'm moist right now,
I'm lubricating.

12:32.104 --> 12:34.439
You're the fastest horse
in my stable, boy.

12:34.441 --> 12:36.742
You think I wanna take
a motherfucking shotgun,

12:36.744 --> 12:39.686
put it in your mouth, blow your brains
all over my nice, motherfucking clothes?

12:39.688 --> 12:41.766
That's the fucking Lewis
I'm talking about.

12:41.768 --> 12:45.382
You think I wanna do that?
You was a revolutionary writer.

12:45.384 --> 12:49.671
You were a radical.
Your words meant something to people.

12:49.673 --> 12:52.166
Either way, it's a good thing
I'm rich, Lewis.

12:52.168 --> 12:53.543
Especially since I'm well hung.

12:53.545 --> 12:56.968
You ain't rich, Moondog.
Your wife's rich.

12:57.577 --> 13:00.135
That's true.

13:00.137 --> 13:02.183
And it's been a while since I had you
in them, but you ain't well hung, boy!

13:02.185 --> 13:04.742
- You ain't well hung!
- Get in there!

13:04.744 --> 13:05.768
Goddamn!

13:06.185 --> 13:08.713
- San Francisco standoff, baby?
- Oh!

13:12.232 --> 13:13.734
I read in <i>The Pelican</i> today Heather's
getting married. It's a big day.

13:13.736 --> 13:16.518
Yeah, this afternoon
handing her off.

13:16.520 --> 13:18.182
Well, congratulations.

13:18.184 --> 13:20.838
And you know what?
I worked through it,

13:20.840 --> 13:23.401
and I'm not even upset, even a little bit,
that I was not included in the ceremonies.

13:24.392 --> 13:25.991
Oh, you thought
you'd be included?

13:25.993 --> 13:28.679
No, well, like I said,
I'm busy, anyway,

13:28.681 --> 13:31.430
so like I said,
I'm not offended.

13:31.432 --> 13:33.800
And I just want to be clear,
this doesn't have to do...

13:34.760 --> 13:36.455
with the incident
a few years back.

13:36.457 --> 13:38.438
Oh, when you walked in
and saw that...

13:38.440 --> 13:40.166
I didn't know
she was changing.

13:40.168 --> 13:42.342
She said you stayed a little
longer than a few seconds.

13:42.344 --> 13:45.926
Well, I used to mix signals back then.

13:45.928 --> 13:49.799
It was a confusing time.
I would misread things often.

13:49.801 --> 13:51.942
Whatever raises your skirt,
man. It never bothered me.

13:51.944 --> 13:54.791
Well, I'm busy, regardless,
so I could not attend,

13:54.793 --> 13:57.638
even if you... if people
had a change of heart.

13:57.640 --> 14:02.342
- I-I, um, have other obligations.
- Sweet as, man.

14:02.344 --> 14:04.199
- Yeah.
- Hey, here's your ball, man.

14:04.201 --> 14:05.990
Let's knock this fucker back to
the fair and get a good line.

14:08.968 --> 14:11.782
- Name is?
- Chardan.

14:11.784 --> 14:14.951
Now, how does that say Chardan
all the way up in a weird line?

14:14.953 --> 14:16.998
Do you know
what my horoscope said?

14:17.000 --> 14:18.822
Don't play with matches.

14:18.824 --> 14:21.769
You don't have to,
because the fire is already lit, sweetie.

14:22.568 --> 14:27.110
That veil is fire.
You got a lot of great things going on

14:27.112 --> 14:29.192
all over your B-O-D-Y
right now.

14:30.121 --> 14:32.198
- I got a leopard.
- Leopard?

14:32.200 --> 14:34.982
- Yeah.
- I've got volcano orange.

Heather, you know I love you
and I love your family

16:10.024 --> 16:12.008
and I'm so happy
to see you get married today.

16:13.033 --> 16:14.312
To him.

16:15.656 --> 16:16.550
And you gotta be ready to take on
everything that she stands for.

16:16.552 --> 16:20.039
What are you doing?

16:20.041 --> 16:21.735
Bye, Mom.

16:23.528 --> 16:26.279
I'm just kidding.

16:26.281 --> 16:28.358
Sweetie, that's not my mom.
You know that.

16:28.360 --> 16:29.670
How are you?

16:29.672 --> 16:30.982
May I borrow that, Lounge?

16:30.984 --> 16:32.295
Sir. Yes, sir.

16:32.297 --> 16:34.088
All right. Everyone knows
this is my daughter.

16:34.505 --> 16:36.327
Me and my Minnie-Boo's daughter.

16:36.329 --> 16:38.118
Aw!

16:38.120 --> 16:40.582
I'm gonna be handing away
the bride-to-be right now.

16:40.584 --> 16:44.358
A little family tradition we got before
we hand over a daughter in our family.

16:44.360 --> 16:45.927
We gotta...

16:45.929 --> 16:47.975
...check the package.

16:47.977 --> 16:50.150
- What are you doing?
- You understand, it's not bad.

16:50.152 --> 16:51.783
Like, five inches flaccid.

16:51.785 --> 16:54.630
Uh, Mr. Ray, your mic, sir.
Thank you.

16:54.632 --> 16:56.454
Pardon the interruption.

16:56.456 --> 16:58.982
We'd like to thank Mr. Moondog
for that presentation.

16:58.984 --> 17:02.951
Today, dearly beloved,
we come together

17:02.953 --> 17:05.862
to give Heather
to Mr. Limpy.

17:05.864 --> 17:08.646
You have one motherfucking
problem with this family.

17:08.648 --> 17:09.798
They fucked up.

17:12.392 --> 17:14.567
Is that
the motherfucking Moondog?

17:14.569 --> 17:17.126
The one and only paw me.
Yeah, Longet.

17:17.128 --> 17:21.926
Moondog, be careful. This here...
I can't even explain it.

17:21.928 --> 17:25.830
This is like a hallucinogenic.
See all kinds of shit, man.

17:25.832 --> 17:29.127
My number one jam, you know, the single
that was number one for 16 weeks.

17:29.129 --> 17:32.615
- Uh-huh.
- This is that thing. Wait, wait, wait.

17:32.617 --> 17:37.190
Be careful, dog You're about to go
to a place you never been before.

17:37.192 --> 17:39.112
That shit don't come
with seat belts.

17:39.817 --> 17:41.382
He almost ruined the whole day.

17:41.384 --> 17:44.039
Don't say that. No, it was fun.

17:44.041 --> 17:45.416
He's fucked up, Mom.

17:46.345 --> 17:49.223
- It's just Moondog.
- Don't make excuses for him.

17:49.225 --> 17:52.937
You just kind of have to accept
that he's from another dimension.

17:53.672 --> 17:54.855
He really is.

17:54.857 --> 17:56.807
And you have to love him for it.
I do.

17:56.809 --> 17:58.887
You and limp dick are
gonna have to accept that.

18:00.745 --> 18:02.759
No, but I do think Moondog's
mother coddled him way too much.

18:02.761 --> 18:06.663
I've told her this before. I mean,
he wore a diaper until he was eight.

18:06.665 --> 18:09.255
Honestly, I think she put brandy
in his little bottle.

18:12.872 --> 18:15.590
Man, I'm high. My nuts
are throbbing right now.

18:15.592 --> 18:18.601
First time I hit this shit,
I nearly went into a coma.

18:19.561 --> 18:21.318
I forgot
how to motherfucking breathe.

18:21.320 --> 18:22.823
What do you see?

18:22.825 --> 18:25.384
The delights of 39 ladies.

18:27.721 --> 18:30.248
What about those cartoons
right there? Can you see them?

18:32.264 --> 18:34.217
Are we looking
at the same screen?

18:37.193 --> 18:40.679
- Are you sleeping with Lingerie?
- Yes. Yes.

18:40.681 --> 18:42.025
And he's a wonderful lover.

18:42.632 --> 18:44.999
Does Dad know?

18:45.001 --> 18:48.359
Your father wouldn't mind, darling.
Your father goes away. You know, Ray is...

18:54.056 --> 18:58.247
Um, I think it was just,
Ray's been there, I mean...

18:58.249 --> 19:02.118
At your third birthday, it was
Ray who brought the pony in.

19:02.120 --> 19:04.967
I remember.
And he blew out my candles.

19:04.969 --> 19:06.918
Exactly. Well, he was stoned.

19:06.920 --> 19:08.807
What's happening
down here, Captain?

19:08.809 --> 19:11.334
Just fuck with me one time, dog.
You are going to love it.

19:11.336 --> 19:13.382
Slide in
with your ride in, dog.

19:13.384 --> 19:16.647
What the fuck?

19:16.649 --> 19:21.126
Moondog, welcome to the NASA
command center of Mary Jane.

19:21.128 --> 19:27.078
This shit only grows in an isolated pond in Jamaica.

19:27.080 --> 19:30.089
It sprouts out of
a pink fluorescent moss patch.

19:30.985 --> 19:34.278
- Pink fluorescent?
- Mmm-hmm.

19:34.280 --> 19:38.694
This weed here is so good, it can make
a motherfucker yearn for the afterlife.

19:38.696 --> 19:41.257
It could send you
to the outer limits of humanity.

19:41.545 --> 19:45.255
That's the keys
and the trees to my success.

19:45.257 --> 19:48.135
Because once a year,
I fly to Jamaica,

19:48.137 --> 19:50.662
throw a concert
in a big, old park.

19:50.664 --> 19:51.977
Bribe the government.

19:52.840 --> 19:56.454
They turn their cheek this way,
and we fly off that way.

19:56.456 --> 19:58.441
- Get down.
- Mmm-hmm.

20:02.825 --> 20:05.511
You won't remember this
but the day you were born,

20:05.513 --> 20:08.358
when you came out of your mother's
womb, I was there between her legs.

20:08.360 --> 20:12.359
And your head came out nice
and smooth with guts all over.

20:12.361 --> 20:14.728
It was a bloody mess
but it was poetry.

20:15.272 --> 20:17.766
I saw your face
but I didn't quite see your eyes

20:17.768 --> 20:20.999
until I stuck my pinky finger
in this like placenta veil

20:21.001 --> 20:24.294
and peeled it back over
your face and there you were.

20:24.296 --> 20:28.710
And that's when I put my hands on both sides
of your head and escorted you into this world.

20:28.712 --> 20:30.375
Aw!

20:30.377 --> 20:33.287
I want to say...
What's your name again?

20:33.289 --> 20:34.535
- For real.
- Frank.

20:34.537 --> 20:36.774
- Frank.
- Frank Upink.

20:36.776 --> 20:37.768
Now...

20:39.401 --> 20:43.526
I give you my daughter to put your hands,
and take her into the rest of the world.

20:43.528 --> 20:45.414
- Aww... beautiful.
- Thank you.

21:01.736 --> 21:02.728
Oh, shit.

21:10.537 --> 21:12.422
In the dusk,
you see that woman.

21:12.424 --> 21:18.182
She is singing to us, calling us
back over the vistas of our past,

21:18.184 --> 21:20.936
right back to our child
hunched under the piano...

21:22.280 --> 21:25.993
sitting in the boom,
and the tinkling strings.

21:26.857 --> 21:29.897
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
He's got his hand on it.

21:30.632 --> 21:32.936
On the foot of his mother.

21:34.057 --> 21:35.720
And she smiles...

21:37.480 --> 21:39.335
as she sings.

21:39.337 --> 21:41.382
And in spite of myself,

21:41.384 --> 21:44.423
the insidious mastery
of the song

21:44.425 --> 21:47.144
has betrayed me back
once again...

21:49.097 --> 21:53.161
to the heart of me,
where I weep to belong.

21:55.464 --> 22:01.096
Oh! That is the most brilliant
shit I've ever heard.

22:01.801 --> 22:02.729
You wrote that?

22:07.976 --> 22:09.543
Yeah, I did.

22:09.545 --> 22:13.095
- That is some wild shit, dog.
- Glad you like it, man.

22:13.097 --> 22:15.047
I wrote that
in my younger years.

22:15.049 --> 22:16.552
Phew!

22:20.488 --> 22:24.422
Actually, D. H.
Lawrence wrote it. All right?

22:24.424 --> 22:28.262
But I stole and plagiarized it for
my seventh-grade poetry contest.

22:28.264 --> 22:29.641
And guess what?

22:31.240 --> 22:32.999
I won that motherfucker.

22:35.209 --> 22:37.225
- Moondog, you my motherfucker.
- Hey, hey.

22:38.089 --> 22:39.592
Family and friends...

22:40.520 --> 22:43.368
thank you for coming and sharing
this perfect day with us.

22:43.913 --> 22:46.439
This day has been
off the hook, am I right?

22:48.745 --> 22:51.174
Heather, you're my angel.

22:51.176 --> 22:53.545
Thanks.

23:20.137 --> 23:23.177
- Where have you been?
- Waiting for you.

23:24.776 --> 23:26.855
Have you seen Moondog, darling?

23:26.857 --> 23:30.502
No, I haven't. But what I do know is
when I don't see him and I see you,

23:30.504 --> 23:32.775
that means
there's more time for us.

I think it's their anniversary
and if it's not, it ought to be.

27:11.657 --> 27:13.544
Oh! Happy anniversary!

27:14.857 --> 27:18.375
Sweetie, don't be insincere with strangers.
It doesn't look good on you.

- Let's go driving.

31:31.145 --> 31:32.456
Hey, there.

31:34.600 --> 31:36.232
Aw.

31:46.376 --> 31:47.944
What do you want to do?

31:49.801 --> 31:51.656
- I...
- What do you want to do?

31:54.089 --> 31:56.103
You're such a fuck-up.

32:10.441 --> 32:12.169
Mmm...

32:26.408 --> 32:29.126
And to Almighty God
we commend the soul

32:29.128 --> 32:30.630
of our departed sister,

32:30.632 --> 32:33.064
and we commit her body
to the ground.

32:33.832 --> 32:38.024
Earth to earth,
ashes to ashes, dust to dust.

32:39.049 --> 32:40.998
Minnie was a fine woman,

32:41.000 --> 32:44.809
and we, her family and friends,
are blessed to have known her.

32:45.640 --> 32:48.807
In the fullness of time,
with the help of the good Lord,

32:48.809 --> 32:51.270
we shall all be with her again.

32:51.272 --> 32:54.984
Until that time, may
the blessings of God Almighty...

33:15.560 --> 33:17.384
How are you doing, honey?

33:17.960 --> 33:22.120
I'm okay. I'm okay. How are you?

33:33.320 --> 33:35.720
"When I was born, I was happy.

33:36.328 --> 33:40.070
I was born on the ocean a gigantic boat.
Big fucking boat.

33:40.072 --> 33:41.543
My parents were fishermen.

33:41.545 --> 33:44.135
Both were
great long-distance runners.

33:44.137 --> 33:46.022
I was read to as a child,

33:46.024 --> 33:49.670
mostly books about survival
and contortion.

33:49.672 --> 33:52.230
I drank off the teats
of caribou, scrumptious,

33:52.232 --> 33:55.079
tasted like jasmine
and cupcakes..."

33:55.081 --> 33:56.775
Fucking good, Moondog.

33:56.777 --> 33:59.302
"I lived through several wars.
They were never fun.

33:59.304 --> 34:00.615
Why? Because I was shot at.

34:00.617 --> 34:02.502
But I fucking returned fire.

34:02.504 --> 34:04.391
I wrote letters to loved ones
and memorized..."

34:05.672 --> 34:08.295
"...stared in the mirror.

34:08.297 --> 34:12.390
I did what I had to do...
to keep going."

34:12.392 --> 34:14.662
Damn, I was good.

34:21.673 --> 34:22.856
That's great poetry.

34:40.073 --> 34:43.462
Come on,
what's nothing mean, huh?

34:43.464 --> 34:47.366
Nothing. That's what it means.
Not a single cent until...

34:47.368 --> 34:48.553
Until what?

34:49.321 --> 34:51.464
You gotta publish your novel
or you get nothing.

34:54.569 --> 34:55.976
Uh...

34:57.128 --> 34:59.846
Minnie always had a feeling
she was going to die before you.

34:59.848 --> 35:03.880
She used to call me up in a panic
because someone did her tarot cards.

35:04.297 --> 35:08.007
Predicted it all, freaked her
out but she was right, I guess.

35:08.009 --> 35:09.544
Her will is very precise.

35:10.664 --> 35:11.881
Minnie had a will.

35:12.713 --> 35:14.408
Motherfucker. That's weird.

35:15.241 --> 35:16.710
Yes, she did.

35:16.712 --> 35:18.503
She was concerned that if
anything ever happened to her,

35:18.505 --> 35:20.550
you'd piss away her family's
fortune and she wanted you

35:20.552 --> 35:23.015
to finally publish your novel.

35:23.017 --> 35:24.423
Poems.

35:24.425 --> 35:27.560
- Whatever.
- I write poetry, you old bitch.

35:28.808 --> 35:31.175
Until then half of everything
goes to Heather,

35:31.177 --> 35:34.278
and the other half of yours
sits frozen in escrow

35:34.280 --> 35:38.246
for a bit of time until you fulfill
the requirements stated here.

35:38.248 --> 35:40.422
It's about time
you guys got here.

35:40.424 --> 35:41.992
I need some help
carrying my luggage.

35:42.409 --> 35:44.329
Come in and kick off your shoes.

35:46.153 --> 35:48.167
<i>Effective immediately, you can go back
to your home, and get your typewriter</i>

35:48.169 --> 35:49.864
<i>and some crappy underwear
but that's it.</i>

35:50.664 --> 35:52.584
<i>You're now persona non grata.</i>

35:52.969 --> 35:55.559
<i>Minnie owned everything.
Everything was in her name.</i>

35:55.561 --> 35:59.464
<i>You're now basically a bum.
She owned the cars, clothes,</i>

36:00.264 --> 36:02.663
<i>houses,
country-club memberships.</i>

36:02.665 --> 36:05.030
- Cats and dogs.
- She did not own all the cats.

36:05.032 --> 36:06.377
Minnie loved you very much.

36:07.304 --> 36:09.543
She just hated seeing you
throw it all away.

36:09.545 --> 36:13.736
Thank you, Minnie-Boo.

36:15.113 --> 36:17.510
Fuck you, as well.

36:17.512 --> 36:19.496
I mean, to be fair, there's a whole
lot of bad guys out there, right?

36:20.105 --> 36:23.208
You guys are with me
in my wife's closet.

36:25.801 --> 36:28.262
This is what you went to
the academy, though, for, right?

36:28.264 --> 36:32.262
Shit like this. Look after guys
like me at times like this.

36:32.264 --> 36:35.718
You never know when you're gonna
catch a fully dressed man unarmed.

36:35.720 --> 36:37.830
I'm gonna wear
my Minnie-Boo's Uggs.

36:38.953 --> 36:41.192
Wear them in her memory.

36:42.121 --> 36:44.521
She had abnormally large feet.

36:45.992 --> 36:47.591
Great fucking style.

36:47.593 --> 36:48.776
See those books?

36:49.801 --> 36:50.600
I wrote those.

36:52.712 --> 36:54.536
You're probably not big readers,
are you?

36:55.529 --> 36:57.160
That's cool, no pressure.

36:58.952 --> 37:01.862
Alvarez,
I wrote that one for you.

37:01.864 --> 37:05.766
Jose, I'm gonna take
a little leave of absence.

37:05.768 --> 37:09.318
But I left you a little bush of
the sticky-icky that you like.

37:09.320 --> 37:11.495
But I can't tell you
where it is.

37:11.497 --> 37:14.246
These guys might go and try and smoke
it, but it's the same place as last time.

37:14.248 --> 37:16.326
- Keep the pool hot.
- I put it on 120 for you.

37:16.328 --> 37:18.982
That's what I'm talking about.

37:18.984 --> 37:21.095
Keep it there, baby, and add the chlorine
'cause I may have a gangbang when I get back.

37:21.097 --> 37:23.303
- I'll invite your mother.
- Thank you, Mr. Moondog.

37:23.305 --> 37:25.670
Wish me luck. I'm off to
write the next great American novel.

37:25.672 --> 37:26.759
Thank you, sir.

37:26.761 --> 37:28.103
Mom did this for a reason.

37:28.105 --> 37:29.641
I'm not
going to let you stay here.

37:30.056 --> 37:31.112
Okay.

37:31.720 --> 37:33.798
Dad...

37:33.800 --> 37:35.814
- Sorry.
- How about just loaning me a little bit of spending cash?

37:35.816 --> 37:37.446
So I can get by
for a week or two.

37:37.448 --> 37:39.080
Dad, I just...

37:40.457 --> 37:42.246
I'll be here for you but just
don't come back till you're ready.

37:42.248 --> 37:44.135
I mean, I'm not asking
for the world here.

37:44.137 --> 37:48.006
I'm just asking for a wee bit
of compassion for your father.

37:48.008 --> 37:50.183
I know.
But when is it going to end?

37:50.185 --> 37:53.510
You're gonna keep coming back and
ask me for more and more and more.

37:53.512 --> 37:54.953
Dad, I love you
but I can't do that.

37:55.624 --> 37:56.840
I just can't.

37:57.833 --> 37:59.814
Just come back
when you're ready but...

37:59.816 --> 38:01.254
Okay, I understand.

38:01.256 --> 38:02.598
- I'm sorry.
- I understand.

38:02.600 --> 38:04.104
Don't apologize to me.

38:05.480 --> 38:08.072
You'll see, you'll see,
my little angel.

38:09.128 --> 38:10.790
I'll be back.

38:10.792 --> 38:12.390
Better than ever, back so good.

38:12.392 --> 38:14.951
You're going to see that I was
never gone in the first place.

38:14.953 --> 38:16.550
I love you, Dad. I'm sorry.

38:16.552 --> 38:17.897
I love you.

38:19.368 --> 38:22.791
I still don't understand how you
married this milk-drinking closet case.

38:22.793 --> 38:26.471
I mean, look at him. He's got
no magic, he's got no style.

38:26.473 --> 38:28.102
He's dressed up
like a J.V. cheerleader.

38:28.104 --> 38:30.377
I had high hopes for you,
Heather. High fucking hopes.

38:31.112 --> 38:34.118
Fuck off! Get out of here,
you fucking turd.

38:34.120 --> 38:35.336
It's okay.

38:35.912 --> 38:38.153
Sorry. He just makes me crazy.

38:40.009 --> 38:42.472
He may be a jerk
but he's a great man.

38:43.753 --> 38:44.936
He's brilliant.

38:45.961 --> 38:48.200
I mean, you'll never be
great or brilliant.

38:50.248 --> 38:51.560
You're dependable.

38:53.992 --> 38:55.529
Oh, well, thanks.

39:18.569 --> 39:21.351
Float me enough cash to get back
down to the Keys

39:21.353 --> 39:25.991
to buy the fun goodies that make me smile
and laugh all day. Is that so much to ask?

39:25.993 --> 39:28.742
I can't do it for you, big papa.
I can't.

39:28.744 --> 39:32.646
Because you know what, I been waiting
for ages and I ain't getting no pages.

39:32.648 --> 39:34.566
<i>I can't do it.</i>

39:34.568 --> 39:35.943
<i>That's a good...
That's a good point.</i>

39:35.945 --> 39:37.350
It is a good point.

39:37.352 --> 39:39.174
That's why I made it,
you dumb fuck.

39:39.176 --> 39:41.735
I'm not asking you to part
the fucking Red Sea for me.

39:41.737 --> 39:45.830
I'm asking for enough loot to set me up for a
few weeks here so I can have my daily goodies.

39:45.832 --> 39:47.910
<i>A little booze, a little weed,
a little poontang.</i>

39:47.912 --> 39:50.630
That is not asking too much.
And since you are saying you won't,

39:50.632 --> 39:52.904
then do your fucking job
and just get me a gig, you know?

39:53.608 --> 39:55.462
Fuck, I'll speak anywhere.

39:55.464 --> 39:58.374
Set me up at a church, public
library, a retirement home...

39:58.376 --> 40:01.734
Mapco! They can pump their gas and they hear
me through the little speakers up there.

40:01.736 --> 40:04.262
The little aluminum thing.

40:04.264 --> 40:08.521
My God. Call my motherfucking chiropractor.
My back is gonna be fucked up tomorrow.

40:09.832 --> 40:12.167
Fucking, I'm not even sure...

40:12.169 --> 40:17.766
Oh, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, is friendship
about, I need something from you?

40:17.768 --> 40:20.007
Do you do you understand
what I'm talking about?

40:20.009 --> 40:21.671
Civility.

40:21.673 --> 40:25.158
- Yes!
- Make complete sense, man.

40:25.160 --> 40:28.518
I have real clients
up for literary awards.

40:28.520 --> 40:31.369
I'm sending faxes at my office.

40:32.137 --> 40:33.032
Hello?

40:35.144 --> 40:38.022
This motherfucker
hung up on me. Oh, my God!

40:43.561 --> 40:44.809
What's going on, guys?

40:45.512 --> 40:47.304
Hey, is Lounger in?

40:48.553 --> 40:51.239
- No.
- Lingerie is not in?

40:51.241 --> 40:52.647
- No.
- Where is he?

40:52.649 --> 40:54.119
Jamaica.

40:54.121 --> 40:58.057
Oh, the magical stoner.

40:59.240 --> 41:03.049
I get your drift, man.
Your silence is code with me.

41:03.977 --> 41:06.953
So what's with the guns? Huh?

41:09.065 --> 41:10.952
You guys ever watched
<i>Magnum P.I.?</i>

41:11.977 --> 41:13.673
It's based on my life.

41:14.696 --> 41:17.480
I watch it all the time.
It's like looking in the fucking mirror.

41:22.120 --> 41:24.712
All right, catch you later.

41:28.073 --> 41:30.152
Hey, let him know
Moondog came by.

42:02.440 --> 42:07.559
The wind, the rain, the stars,
the bird, the clock will answer you.

42:07.561 --> 42:09.510
Get drunk, good man.

42:12.457 --> 42:14.953
Get drunk, and stay drunk.

42:15.656 --> 42:17.798
Is that poetry?

42:17.800 --> 42:21.095
Of course it's poetry, you toothless,
illiterate chump. It's Baudelaire.

42:21.097 --> 42:22.919
- Here's a poem.
- Come on.

42:22.921 --> 42:28.326
It goes...

42:34.184 --> 42:37.062
Not bad, Phil, not bad at all.

42:37.064 --> 42:39.017
Hey,
who wants to go on a field trip?

44:08.264 --> 44:12.327
This your car here?

44:12.329 --> 44:15.272
Why did you destroy your own house?

44:16.040 --> 44:19.784
Boredom, I guess. I don't know.

44:20.521 --> 44:23.879
Dad. What is wrong with you?

44:23.881 --> 44:25.350
I'm fine.

44:25.352 --> 44:26.631
I'm really better than fine.

44:26.633 --> 44:28.614
This is another little adventure
we are on.

44:28.616 --> 44:30.438
When did you become
such a Republican?

44:30.440 --> 44:31.910
Republican?

44:31.912 --> 44:33.320
- Whatever.
- Oh, my God.

44:33.961 --> 44:36.263
I'm just getting my groove on.
Having a little fun.

44:36.265 --> 44:38.343
- Your groove?
- Yeah.

44:38.345 --> 44:40.712
- What groove?
- Honey, whoa...

44:41.480 --> 44:43.400
When was the last time
you laughed, honey?

44:44.680 --> 44:46.825
Do the thing. See if you can
make my baby laugh.

44:48.520 --> 44:52.104
Hi, Heather,
I am Toothless Phil.

44:52.585 --> 44:54.471
I am a good friend
of your daddy.

44:54.473 --> 44:58.728
We want you to be happy. We
love you just the way you are.

44:59.113 --> 45:02.984
Who's your daddy? Moondog's
your daddy. He loves you.

45:04.552 --> 45:05.641
Mmm-hmm.

45:06.025 --> 45:07.462
Back again, huh?

45:07.464 --> 45:10.441
Your choice, prison or rehab.

45:11.497 --> 45:13.254
Is there a third option?

45:13.256 --> 45:16.134
- Nope. Last chance.
- Rehab, it is.

45:16.136 --> 45:17.574
Preferably somewhere tropical.

45:17.576 --> 45:19.559
I'm remanding you
to the custody of your daughter.

45:19.561 --> 45:21.894
She will escort you
to a rehab facility now.

45:21.896 --> 45:23.207
Great.

45:23.209 --> 45:25.254
You need to spend
a mandatory 12 months there,

45:25.256 --> 45:27.335
- getting your life back together.
- Twelve days is not a problem.

45:27.337 --> 45:28.775
Twelve months.

45:31.496 --> 45:32.615
Okay.

45:32.617 --> 45:33.927
It all stops now.

45:33.929 --> 45:35.783
- The foolishness.
- I understand.

45:35.785 --> 45:37.350
I need a change of pace.
Yeah, yeah.

45:37.352 --> 45:39.591
And if you mess this up,
it's jail time.

45:39.593 --> 45:41.351
If I may suggest, Your Honor...

45:41.353 --> 45:43.142
Tell 'er, Moondog!

45:43.144 --> 45:46.343
I was told of this amazing rehab
facility in the Virgin Islands.

45:46.345 --> 45:49.350
It's got an open bar
and 24-hour Thai massage.

45:49.352 --> 45:53.606
An old jerky jerk could take the
edge off during the detox period.

45:53.608 --> 45:56.039
Drain the old jizz pipe
of the antitoxins.

45:56.041 --> 45:59.366
- Excuse me?
- With all due respect to my own

45:59.368 --> 46:02.471
personal, fluid transition
into my sobriety,

46:02.473 --> 46:06.246
I wanna let you know that the
therapeutic value of a groin massage

46:06.248 --> 46:08.519
during the acute withdrawal
phase is off the charts.

46:08.521 --> 46:11.305
- Fucking medicinal.
- It's not gonna happen.

46:12.040 --> 46:14.694
- It's not gonna happen.
- Why you gotta be like that?

46:14.696 --> 46:17.190
You know, I was a real fan
of your writing, Moondog.

46:17.192 --> 46:19.753
Huh?

46:21.032 --> 46:22.441
Shut up.

46:23.753 --> 46:27.398
You know, it amazes me how someone
that can write so beautifully

46:27.400 --> 46:29.351
can be so crude and reckless.

46:29.353 --> 46:31.559
Don't you be acting like you
never heard the rooster crow.

46:31.561 --> 46:35.080
Don't let us down, Moondog.
We're rooting for you. Next.

46:35.752 --> 46:36.680
Get him out of there.

46:37.545 --> 46:40.646
Heather, my dear.
Would you be so kind

46:40.648 --> 46:43.849
as to pull over and get
your old man one final beer?

46:45.512 --> 46:46.537
Sure, Dad.

46:47.753 --> 46:52.455
Give me a Lucky Lotto, Triple
Seven and a cigar, would you?

46:52.457 --> 46:53.353
Sure.

46:54.184 --> 46:57.864
- You don't sell acid, do you?
- No.

46:58.249 --> 47:00.904
That's too bad.
This place used to.

47:05.033 --> 47:06.376
Your mother loved me.

47:07.112 --> 47:08.456
Yes, Dad.

47:08.840 --> 47:11.622
- She said that?
- Of course.

47:11.624 --> 47:15.976
- She think I was brilliant?
- She thought you were a genius.

47:17.513 --> 47:18.856
She said that?

47:20.840 --> 47:23.113
That's why she stayed with you
all those years.

47:25.000 --> 47:28.073
And that's why you've always been
able to get away with everything, Dad.

47:30.793 --> 47:34.889
Ah, Minnie-Boo.
She had an incredible ass.

47:36.264 --> 47:39.593
Could fellate like a python. Fuck,
she could fellate a python if she wanted.

47:41.513 --> 47:42.632
I'm gonna miss her.

47:49.385 --> 47:50.536
Let's go to rehab.

47:58.025 --> 47:59.975
Hmm.
I'll try and do better, okay?

47:59.977 --> 48:02.631
Okay, you can do this.

48:02.633 --> 48:05.447
Hmm, yeah. All right, Sunrise.

48:05.449 --> 48:06.952
Let's get this party started.

48:08.425 --> 48:10.950
Really wasn't up to me. Should
have heard the judge, man.

48:10.952 --> 48:13.062
She swung a hard gavel.

48:13.064 --> 48:14.185
She was a fan of mine too.

48:14.953 --> 48:16.679
Which is kind of weird.

48:16.681 --> 48:18.534
I mean, I wouldn't have come
down here like, you know,

48:18.536 --> 48:20.838
if I didn't have a little bit
of a nudge, you know.

48:20.840 --> 48:23.270
Well, this lady's very happy
that you're here.

48:23.272 --> 48:25.511
We have your entire year
planned out.

48:25.513 --> 48:28.489
So when you leave us,
you'll be a changed person.

48:33.193 --> 48:35.910
God, grant me the serenity

48:35.912 --> 48:38.982
to accept the things
I cannot change

48:38.984 --> 48:42.054
and the courage to change
the things I can,

48:42.056 --> 48:43.945
and the wisdom to know
the difference.

48:49.384 --> 48:51.304
You guys are funny.

48:51.689 --> 48:52.775
That's such bullshit.

48:54.409 --> 48:57.001
Ah, you are
fucking talking to yourself.

48:57.416 --> 49:02.151
What's up, everybody? My name
is J.C. Cramer. Third time here.

49:02.153 --> 49:05.223
What? Who's repeating?
Who's repeating? Oh, you are.

49:05.225 --> 49:08.807
Yeah. First time I was here,
I was drinking a lot.

49:08.809 --> 49:11.655
So I decided to make myself
a better person.

49:11.657 --> 49:13.190
I decided to come here.

49:13.192 --> 49:15.462
When I got out, I was good
for about six months,

49:15.464 --> 49:19.431
and my friends were like, "Dude,
you don't have to drink to have fun..."

49:24.137 --> 49:27.207
My dad's a preacher. He's the
one that fucking put me in here.

49:27.209 --> 49:28.806
Why?

49:28.808 --> 49:30.887
Because he caught me
huffing paint a few times.

49:30.889 --> 49:34.342
Also, I was breaking into people's
houses and just burning shit.

49:34.344 --> 49:36.326
Like, nothing real bad.

49:36.328 --> 49:38.279
I love lighting shit on fire.

49:38.281 --> 49:40.199
I'm a tiger, bro.
It wasn't dangerous.

49:40.201 --> 49:42.054
- Yeah.
- Nobody was home.

49:42.056 --> 49:44.039
We didn't find out the kids
were upstairs until later.

49:44.041 --> 49:45.990
If I wasn't there, they would've
fucking burned to death.

49:45.992 --> 49:47.879
- I got 'em out.
- From the second floor?

49:47.881 --> 49:49.702
- Yeah.
- With a ladder, and shit?

49:49.704 --> 49:51.174
Yeah. No. I just went upstairs.

49:51.176 --> 49:52.263
- That's cool.
- Yeah.

49:54.089 --> 49:57.414
- What type of music is this?
- Christian fucking metal, man.

49:57.416 --> 49:59.751
- Do you like it?
- I do.

49:59.753 --> 50:03.654
The band is from Albuquerque. The lead
singer fucking blew himself up by accident.

50:03.656 --> 50:06.022
Accident? Nice.

50:06.024 --> 50:08.934
Fucking gone, dude,
just disappeared. Fucking weird.

50:08.936 --> 50:10.535
How do you know these guys, man?

50:10.537 --> 50:13.638
I was in a cover band. And
goddamn! We used to fucking...

50:13.640 --> 50:16.199
...rock this shit.

50:16.201 --> 50:18.857
I don't blame you, man,
this is good shit.

50:19.849 --> 50:22.055
Do you think
about getting out of here?

50:22.057 --> 50:24.713
Out there is the real world.

50:25.417 --> 50:27.462
In here is the fake world.

50:27.464 --> 50:29.094
All right?

50:29.096 --> 50:31.655
Out there is beautiful.
Things really happen.

50:31.657 --> 50:36.678
The seasons change, babies are
born, old men wither away and die.

50:36.680 --> 50:38.951
<i>The fucking sands of time.</i>

50:38.953 --> 50:41.190
Eloquently put, Flicker.

50:41.192 --> 50:42.983
The choice is yours.

50:42.985 --> 50:46.344
Sell me no more, man.
Let's blow this fucking joint.

50:52.424 --> 50:54.920
That is real shit, bro!
Guess we go for time.

50:55.337 --> 50:58.151
Fast into overdrive. Fucking
punch this shit, Bro. Go!

50:58.153 --> 51:00.774
Fuck you!

51:00.776 --> 51:05.190
Come on, baby, let's go.
Fucking freedom!

51:05.192 --> 51:07.400
Like, can't you feel it,
brother?

51:07.784 --> 51:11.687
Love is in the air. See,
things happen in the real world.

51:11.689 --> 51:15.591
Look, we're at a wedding.
And my God, look at that boat.

51:15.593 --> 51:17.990
Oh, beautiful.

51:17.992 --> 51:19.431
Beautiful! Congrats, man!

51:23.017 --> 51:24.329
Get back here, asshole.

51:25.417 --> 51:27.078
Have a great honeymoon.

51:27.080 --> 51:29.031
You two look fucking fine.

51:44.329 --> 51:48.423
We're free, man. You drove that golf
cart with the wings of God behind you.

51:48.425 --> 51:52.007
Let's get up to a little
Devil's business before we get saved.

51:52.009 --> 51:53.958
You know the best part
about the devil.

51:53.960 --> 51:56.039
Fucking, he finds the fun.

51:56.041 --> 51:58.919
And then we take Jesus and we just
ride him all the way to the top,

51:58.921 --> 52:01.446
because the best part is, we can
do whatever the fuck we want.

52:01.448 --> 52:03.337
Jesus already paid
for all our sins.

52:03.817 --> 52:06.407
- Excuse me, thank you.
- Fuck you, pal.

52:07.944 --> 52:09.449
Hey, do that flick thing you do.

52:13.993 --> 52:15.080
Do it again.

52:18.824 --> 52:21.735
- Moondog!
- Do you know what we need?

52:21.737 --> 52:24.615
- What, what do we need?
- We need money, man.

52:24.617 --> 52:26.279
Fucking money.

52:26.281 --> 52:28.038
Goddamn it,
you're a fucking genius.

52:28.040 --> 52:29.607
I know
where we can get some money.

52:29.609 --> 52:32.327
- Where?
- Just follow me, my friend.

52:32.329 --> 52:34.151

Hey!

56:52.264 --> 56:54.438
- Place is good.
- What's up, man?

56:54.440 --> 56:57.158
- It's pretty lunar these days, man.
- Good to see you.

56:57.160 --> 57:01.734
Gotta tell you, Moondog, business
is so good, I bought a second boat.

57:01.736 --> 57:04.071
- Yeah?
- Yeah. Named it <i>Success.</i>

57:04.073 --> 57:06.470
I just take tourists
to the Outer Key.

57:06.472 --> 57:09.446
When they see a dolphin,
I act all fucking stoked.

57:09.448 --> 57:12.678
Right. Oh, there's a dolphin.
Look at the baby dolphin.

57:12.680 --> 57:15.337
Tell him to dive in
and make sure they don't drown.

57:15.817 --> 57:18.663
- I only had four deaths on my watch.
- Only four?

57:18.665 --> 57:21.959
Four deaths in over eight
straight years of dolphin touring.

57:21.961 --> 57:23.399
It's a terrific record.

57:23.401 --> 57:25.383
Now, I've been stripped
of my license temporarily

57:25.385 --> 57:28.902
on five separate occasions but each
time, I get it reinstated

57:28.904 --> 57:31.782
due to a technicality
I never quite understood.

57:31.784 --> 57:32.967
It is beyond luck.

57:32.969 --> 57:35.430
Karma, man, I'm blessed, bruh.

57:35.432 --> 57:36.551
Meant to be.

57:36.553 --> 57:38.438
I've seen many in this industry.

57:38.440 --> 57:40.457
They fucked with old Captain
Whack around these parts.

57:42.088 --> 57:43.623
Don't fuck with Captain Whack.

57:43.625 --> 57:47.113
You will get whacked
for fucking with Captain Whack.

57:53.608 --> 57:57.414
Dolphins. I love
those fucking dolphins, man.

57:57.416 --> 57:59.622
The sounds
that come out of their mouth...

57:59.624 --> 58:01.767
They're trying
to communicate with you.

58:01.769 --> 58:04.326
All you gotta do
is talk back to 'em.

58:04.328 --> 58:08.231
I fell in love with dolphins ever since
I saw the show <i>Flipper.</i> Blew me away.

58:08.233 --> 58:10.311
How they make that noise.

58:13.193 --> 58:15.590
I'll tell you, I wouldn't
be able to live like this

58:15.592 --> 58:18.662
if I wasn't fucking doing
dolphin tours.

58:18.664 --> 58:19.784
I wouldn't have all this.

58:20.456 --> 58:22.408
This is all from dolphin tours.

58:24.584 --> 58:27.302
I've got something.
Get your ass...

58:27.304 --> 58:30.152
There. Oh, we gonna fry
this motherfucker up.

58:30.952 --> 58:32.104
Yes.

58:33.289 --> 58:35.912
Gotta get your tastebuds ready.
Yeah. This is almost done.

58:36.457 --> 58:38.664
Lookee here, Moondog.
You come work for me, man.

58:39.049 --> 58:40.742
It would be great.

58:40.744 --> 58:43.590
Dolphins are great, when they
go up and down in the water

58:43.592 --> 58:45.767
like porpoise,
you'll learn that shit, man.

58:45.769 --> 58:47.015
That sounds cool, Whack.

58:47.017 --> 58:48.649
Yeah. I'm here now.

58:49.352 --> 58:51.398
What the fuck?

58:51.400 --> 58:53.096
- Fucking...
- Man, that shit's loaded.

58:53.480 --> 58:56.838
Man! You could've killed
a dolphin, Moon Dog.

58:56.840 --> 58:59.463
You want to shoot something, shoot this thing here.

58:59.465 --> 59:01.031
This is what I used in 'Nam.

59:01.033 --> 59:02.153
Shit, man.

59:03.560 --> 59:06.215
Now I gotta feed
my coke-addicted parrot.

59:06.217 --> 59:08.713
- Yeah, set him up.
- Give me some of this shit right here.

59:09.800 --> 59:11.015
Oh, yeah.

59:11.017 --> 59:12.678
There you go.

59:12.680 --> 59:15.239
She's gonna get high as shit.

59:15.241 --> 59:19.398
But seriously, Moondog, I could use a partner
and I got a good sense about you, man.

59:19.400 --> 59:22.278
- Like I say, I'm in.
- Yeah, man. Yeah.

59:22.280 --> 59:24.423
We become millionaires
together, man.

59:24.425 --> 59:27.558
- Shit, man. Looks good.
- Look how far I've come so far.

59:27.560 --> 59:28.775
I like your style, Whack.

59:30.601 --> 59:32.967
Look at that, see
the juices dripping off that?

59:32.969 --> 59:35.720
- Oh, man, that's gonna be good.
- Gonna be real good, man.

59:37.256 --> 59:38.633
I like your swagger.

59:39.529 --> 59:41.318
Thanks, Moondog.

59:41.320 --> 59:44.393
Got nicked in 'Nam,
makes me walk like a pimp.

59:45.289 --> 59:51.622
Some shrapnel partially shredded my nut
sack but everything still works fine.

59:51.624 --> 59:53.737
Bop, bop, bop.

59:54.472 --> 59:57.798
Well, usually, when people call and
say they coming for the dolphin tour,

59:57.800 --> 1:00:00.230
they come and they pay cash,
right?

1:00:00.232 --> 1:00:02.473
My bread and butter,
baby, my bread and butter.

1:00:03.241 --> 1:00:07.655
So you can tell in the tone of their
voice, they're, like, serious.

1:00:07.657 --> 1:00:09.926
Exactly. If they really
love the dolphins

1:00:09.928 --> 1:00:14.375
and if they really want to see the dolphins,
you hear it in their voice, right?

1:00:14.377 --> 1:00:16.712
See? That's right.

1:00:17.672 --> 1:00:22.439
Come on over. Yes. Hi. Welcome.

1:00:22.441 --> 1:00:25.254
Lots of dolphins for you today.
Yeah.

1:00:25.256 --> 1:00:28.518
Act real stoked.
Act real stoked. Yeah!

1:00:31.912 --> 1:00:33.479
- Welcome aboard.
- Welcome.

1:00:33.481 --> 1:00:36.135
- What's your name, little lady?
- Lexie Lipschitz.

1:00:36.137 --> 1:00:39.592
I knew it.
Hello, Miss Lipschitz.

1:00:40.040 --> 1:00:42.470
- Hello.
- Dr. Lipschitz, call me Ted.

1:00:42.472 --> 1:00:44.934
- All the Schitzes.
- One, two, three.

1:00:44.936 --> 1:00:48.807
<i>♪ We are the Lipschitzes
That is our name ♪</i>

1:00:48.809 --> 1:00:50.759
Listen up, everybody.
All right.

1:00:50.761 --> 1:00:52.583
We're in the middle
of mating season.

1:00:52.585 --> 1:00:55.494
If you see some humping,
don't look away.

1:00:55.496 --> 1:00:57.095
It's cool, looking.

1:00:57.097 --> 1:00:59.015
It's nature in all its glory.

1:00:59.017 --> 1:01:00.359
Dolphins love to bone.

1:01:00.361 --> 1:01:03.239
- Oh, my God.
- Listen up, kids!

1:01:03.241 --> 1:01:06.119
Greatest guide in the history of dolphin
guiding, sharing wisdom with you.

1:01:06.121 --> 1:01:09.350
- Thanks, Moondog.
- It's a fact. Now, what he failed to mention,

1:01:09.352 --> 1:01:12.935
that these dolphins have got
a sort of corkscrew pecker.

1:01:12.937 --> 1:01:16.070
All right. A little, whippy,
winding ranky-cank thing.

1:01:16.072 --> 1:01:18.278
It's true, kids.
It's sort of like a corkscrew.

1:01:18.280 --> 1:01:20.231
- People, look out.
- And it's orgy season.

1:01:20.233 --> 1:01:23.495
So hopefully, we will get to see
something, some real wild stuff.

1:01:23.497 --> 1:01:26.214
Everybody's fucking, they're really
horny this time of the season.

1:01:26.216 --> 1:01:28.007
So watch your back, Carnello.

1:01:28.009 --> 1:01:29.735
Some of them prefer redheads.

1:01:29.737 --> 1:01:31.559
Is this thing safe?

1:01:31.561 --> 1:01:33.863
Very safe. I wouldn't have you
on here if it wasn't safe.

1:01:33.865 --> 1:01:36.486
Family, I just gotta tell you,
I love dolphins so much.

1:01:36.488 --> 1:01:40.070
After today, you're gonna love
dolphins as much as I love dolphins.

1:01:40.072 --> 1:01:41.511
They don't hurt you.

1:01:41.513 --> 1:01:43.238
- They just want to love you...
- Dolphins know this man.

1:01:43.240 --> 1:01:46.118
They come from all over the
world to come see Captain Whack.

1:01:46.120 --> 1:01:49.064
- They're coming to see me.
- You guys get to be on his boat today.

1:01:51.272 --> 1:01:52.838
All right, all right.

1:01:52.840 --> 1:01:54.502
I see a few out there.

1:01:54.504 --> 1:01:55.911
We have business.
Who wants to dive in?

1:01:55.913 --> 1:01:57.863
No, we're good.

1:01:57.865 --> 1:02:01.128
It's prime mating season.
Seaweed is an aphrodisiac.

1:02:02.120 --> 1:02:03.750
I think they're getting
cold feet black, Whack.

1:02:03.752 --> 1:02:06.054
All right.
Last chance, any takers?

1:02:06.056 --> 1:02:08.519
- No...
- Y'all are a bunch of pussies.

1:02:08.521 --> 1:02:11.048
Dolphins, here I come, baby.

1:02:13.352 --> 1:02:16.071
Get... Get in!

1:02:16.073 --> 1:02:19.336
Get in. This water's beautiful.

1:02:21.320 --> 1:02:24.617
- Honey, look at the dolphins.
- Lots of dolphins, motherfuckers.

1:02:26.120 --> 1:02:29.415
- Does that look right?
- Get in! The water's perfect!

1:02:29.417 --> 1:02:32.137
You good, Whack? Are you good?

1:02:33.577 --> 1:02:37.383
- Dolphins...
- Honey, honey, honey!

1:02:37.385 --> 1:02:39.080
That doesn't
look like a dolphin fin.

1:02:39.817 --> 1:02:42.728
Captain, that kinda looks
like a shark fin.

1:02:43.624 --> 1:02:45.542
This must all be part of a show.

1:02:45.544 --> 1:02:48.264
I'm having a great time.
It's perfect.

1:02:50.696 --> 1:02:52.457
Come back, Mr. Whack!

1:02:53.609 --> 1:02:56.168
Oh! What the fuck?

1:02:57.320 --> 1:03:01.383
Fuck it, Whack! You put on a fucking show, man.

1:03:01.385 --> 1:03:02.824
This ain't
no motherfucking dolph...

1:03:07.177 --> 1:03:11.622
- Whoa, that's cool.
- When was the last time he cut his toenails, seriously?

1:03:11.624 --> 1:03:16.518
- That's gnarly.
- Shit. Holy shit.

1:03:16.520 --> 1:03:20.391
- Oh, Lord!
- Just a flesh wound. Don't worry!

1:03:20.393 --> 1:03:22.856
Holy shit, where's my foot?

1:03:23.369 --> 1:03:26.281
Fuck, Whack.
He got a pretty good, man.

1:03:26.953 --> 1:03:29.670
Oh, man. Couldn't have been
a fucking dolphin.

1:03:29.672 --> 1:03:31.815
Can't believe this shit, man.

1:03:31.817 --> 1:03:35.753
I'm pretty sure it wasn't a dolphin
that bit you, just look at your foot.

1:03:37.417 --> 1:03:39.527
Listen, you're gonna be all right.
You're gonna be just fine.

1:03:39.529 --> 1:03:41.094
I mean,
it's just a little flesh wound.

1:03:41.096 --> 1:03:42.409
You're gonna be up dancing
in no time.

1:03:44.360 --> 1:03:46.022
You going somewhere,
motherfucker?

1:03:46.024 --> 1:03:48.265
Yeah, I am.

1:03:49.832 --> 1:03:51.176
Trade you, though.

1:03:53.096 --> 1:03:54.697
Foot for the hat, huh?

1:03:55.528 --> 1:03:57.350
Come on.

1:03:57.352 --> 1:03:58.950
Here we go. Cool, man.

1:03:58.952 --> 1:04:00.903
It's been real, Moondog.

1:04:00.905 --> 1:04:03.719
It's been more than that.
It's been whack, Captain Whack.

1:04:05.192 --> 1:04:06.377
See you down the road.

1:04:23.881 --> 1:04:26.696
Look at what the Moondog
just sniffed out.

1:04:27.752 --> 1:04:32.904
Yeah, yeah, yeah, Lounger!
Hey, Jimmy.

1:04:33.353 --> 1:04:35.078
- I'm back.
- Moondog?

1:04:35.080 --> 1:04:37.670
- Yeah. I'm back!
- Where the fuck you been, man?

1:04:37.672 --> 1:04:39.015
You look like shit.

1:04:39.017 --> 1:04:41.478
No, I look like I always look.

1:04:41.480 --> 1:04:42.951
We're about to set sail.
Come fuck with us.

1:04:42.953 --> 1:04:44.615
Let's go.

1:04:44.617 --> 1:04:46.697
I think we need to look
at a positive ID on him.

1:04:47.272 --> 1:04:48.903
Make sure the motherfucker
washes his feet.

1:04:48.905 --> 1:04:51.654
Take your shoes off, dog, when
you get on the fucking boat.

1:04:58.249 --> 1:05:00.359
Glad I came up on y'all, man.

1:05:00.361 --> 1:05:02.759
You did, man, but you look like you
in some serious shit, though, dog.

1:05:02.761 --> 1:05:05.798
- Give it up. Jimmy, tell him.
- You're in serious shit, man.

1:05:05.800 --> 1:05:08.070
How do you figure "serious"?

1:05:08.072 --> 1:05:11.015
I've heard from some guys down, you
know, the US-born people, Keys people.

1:05:11.017 --> 1:05:13.415
- Word's out down there.
- Word on the street's

1:05:13.417 --> 1:05:16.295
that you did escape and then
the pigs is on your ass now.

1:05:16.297 --> 1:05:17.286
Both are true.

1:05:17.288 --> 1:05:18.982
Shit.

1:05:18.984 --> 1:05:21.158
Yeah, that sounds pretty cool
the way you put it.

1:05:21.160 --> 1:05:23.399

get off my chest with you, man.

1:06:31.529 --> 1:06:34.057
Don't really know how to say
it. I'm just gonna come clean.

1:06:34.537 --> 1:06:38.279
I was having an affair with Minnie,
man, several years behind your back.

1:06:38.281 --> 1:06:44.550
I'm talking about really sexually
wild experiences with your wife, man.

1:06:44.552 --> 1:06:49.256
- Yeah, I figured as much.
- I do know she didn't love me.

1:06:50.248 --> 1:06:52.391
She loved my sex
but she didn't love me.

1:06:52.393 --> 1:06:57.030
I was the R&B singer with the big
ding-a-ling. I was just a diversion.

1:06:57.032 --> 1:06:59.015
Until you came back. You dig?

1:06:59.017 --> 1:07:00.966
But she honestly loved you.

1:07:00.968 --> 1:07:03.078
I know that for a fact.

1:07:03.080 --> 1:07:04.967
- She did, didn't she?
- She loved the fuck out of you, Moondog.

1:07:04.969 --> 1:07:07.336
I really loved her, man.
Still do.

1:07:07.753 --> 1:07:10.502
- So sexual.
- Hypersexual.

1:07:10.504 --> 1:07:12.774
Oh, man,
the moves that she doing.

1:07:12.776 --> 1:07:14.663
She had these tiny hands.

1:07:14.665 --> 1:07:17.670
And what I loved about her tiny
hands, it made my cock look so big.

1:07:17.672 --> 1:07:19.527
You should've seen what mine
looked like in her hands.

1:07:19.529 --> 1:07:23.334
The way she went down on me,
I could just see it right now.

1:07:23.336 --> 1:07:25.095
- Yeah.
- And if you make eye contact.

1:07:25.097 --> 1:07:27.496
Yeah, I hear you. That's enough.

1:07:29.033 --> 1:07:30.345
I had a crazy-ass dream.

1:07:31.145 --> 1:07:33.479
To help you get out of that
motherfucking thing that you're in.

1:07:33.481 --> 1:07:36.422
I had a dream you was dressed
like a woman to help you escape.

1:07:36.424 --> 1:07:39.654
- A woman?
- Yeah, I had the same dream.

1:07:39.656 --> 1:07:42.022
I had this guy,
buddy in Vietnam,

1:07:42.024 --> 1:07:44.550
dressed up like a geisha,
walked out of the war.

1:07:46.120 --> 1:07:48.742
- Get in touch with your...
- His femininity.

1:07:48.744 --> 1:07:50.055
Tap into it, man.

1:07:50.057 --> 1:07:51.846
It may not be a bad look
after all.

1:07:51.848 --> 1:07:54.023
You understand me. I can see you
with a dress on, and everything.

1:07:54.025 --> 1:07:55.943
Moondog,
you might get used to it.

1:07:55.945 --> 1:07:58.502
The dog wanna dress
in some high heels.

1:07:58.504 --> 1:08:00.326
Let him strut the runway.

1:08:00.328 --> 1:08:02.246
It's a ridiculous idea.

1:08:02.248 --> 1:08:04.681
It's kinda fucking freaky
and genius, guys.

1:08:05.288 --> 1:08:07.208
I think I already got
the underwear right.

1:08:08.425 --> 1:08:10.728
And if I got my walk right.

1:08:11.240 --> 1:08:13.033
This'll be too easy.

1:08:13.672 --> 1:08:15.047
Oh, look it there.

1:08:15.049 --> 1:08:18.023
Motherfucker giving
the whole moon there, Moondog.

1:08:18.025 --> 1:08:19.943
You hear me?

1:08:19.945 --> 1:08:21.575
You actually look good, dog.

1:08:21.577 --> 1:08:23.718
I mean, it's kinda
fucking freaky, right?

1:08:23.720 --> 1:08:26.118
I mean,
it's supposed to look freaky.

1:08:26.120 --> 1:08:28.518
You a freaky little fish. That's what's
gonna throw the police off. You dig?

1:08:31.657 --> 1:08:35.367
Moondog, ain't nobody gonna fucking
recognize you in that shit right there.

1:08:35.369 --> 1:08:38.982
Especially the fucking pigs.
You fucking look amazing right now, dog.

1:08:38.984 --> 1:08:41.094
Do you know what the challenge
of this situation is gonna be?

1:08:41.096 --> 1:08:43.622
- Yes, ma'am.
- Dudes are gonna want my shit.

1:08:49.256 --> 1:08:52.038
We slipping through the city
unseen.

1:08:52.040 --> 1:08:54.407
What a disguise,
a perfect disguise, baby.

1:08:54.409 --> 1:08:57.062
Your bitches
are gonna get hot on you,

1:08:57.064 --> 1:08:59.975
seeing you riding around
with a hot blonde like me.

1:08:59.977 --> 1:09:02.279
They gonna like the fact.
This is that interracial shit.

1:09:02.281 --> 1:09:05.958
Like Jim Brown with Raquel Welch.
You know what I'm talkin' about?

1:09:05.960 --> 1:09:08.009
I love it when a plan
comes together.

1:09:09.865 --> 1:09:11.368
Anything for a friend.

1:09:12.296 --> 1:09:13.832
Jim Dubie's bud.

1:09:14.569 --> 1:09:17.030
Yes! Yes!

1:09:17.032 --> 1:09:18.119
Look at that.

1:09:18.121 --> 1:09:20.102
Heaven looks like that, Lounger.

1:09:20.104 --> 1:09:22.886
Think of it like this, dog. I'm
gonna give you so much of this,

1:09:22.888 --> 1:09:25.895
you gonna be able to write you a
couple of novels and that poetry shit.

1:09:25.897 --> 1:09:28.007
Poetry...

1:09:28.009 --> 1:09:29.895
Yeah, I'm talking about poems out
of your motherfucking asshole.

1:09:29.897 --> 1:09:31.175
Yes, yes.

1:09:31.177 --> 1:09:33.863
This is the safecracker
right here.

1:09:33.865 --> 1:09:36.839
To crack the safe
to write that thing

1:09:36.841 --> 1:09:39.335
and getting that money!

1:09:39.337 --> 1:09:44.393
Because this is the key to unlocking all
of those juices in that head of yours.

1:09:45.128 --> 1:09:46.153
Trust me.

1:09:57.737 --> 1:09:58.889
- Cops are here.
- <i>Say what?</i>

1:09:59.849 --> 1:10:01.160
The pigs is here right now?

1:10:02.537 --> 1:10:06.150
Fuck! I must've been high as a
motherfucker when I hatched that plan.

1:10:06.152 --> 1:10:08.070
Gas up the seaplane.

1:10:08.072 --> 1:10:09.959
Go get my shit
out of the magical room.

1:10:09.961 --> 1:10:11.846
Somebody scrape up Moondog.

1:10:11.848 --> 1:10:14.310
It's time to go.
Let's load this shit up.

1:10:14.312 --> 1:10:16.935
Let's get it rolling.
Stop dillydallying, the cops is coming.

1:10:16.937 --> 1:10:19.974
Load up the motherfucking rasta van.
I'm bringing y'all for the music.

1:10:19.976 --> 1:10:23.495
We on the run like we used to be back in
the day. Let's get the fuck out of here.

1:10:23.497 --> 1:10:25.446
Hurry, man!
Hurry! Put it in now.

1:10:25.448 --> 1:10:29.030
Lingerie, close the fucking door.
It's time to go.

1:10:29.032 --> 1:10:31.175
<i>You know I got
a motherfucking master plan.</i>

1:10:31.177 --> 1:10:33.992
<i>My rastas are gonna fly you
to the Keys on my seaplane.</i>

1:10:34.472 --> 1:10:38.247
<i>Time to get
me down to Key West, baby.</i>

1:10:38.249 --> 1:10:40.201
<i>Cops ain't never gonna
catch the Moondog.</i>

1:10:40.840 --> 1:10:43.143
Moondog, hurry up.
Get this shit on the plane fast.

1:10:43.145 --> 1:10:45.382
I hope
we got enough weed for this.

1:10:45.384 --> 1:10:46.598
Let's go, man.

1:10:46.600 --> 1:10:47.655
Yeah.

1:10:47.657 --> 1:10:49.382
Shit.

1:10:49.384 --> 1:10:50.855
This is gonna be fun.

1:10:50.857 --> 1:10:52.232
Didn't know
it would be this easy.

1:10:53.161 --> 1:10:55.880
Hey, is he a good pilot?

1:10:56.521 --> 1:10:58.247
- Not at all.
- Not at all?

1:10:58.249 --> 1:11:00.104
No, man. He got glaucoma
in both his eyes.

1:11:00.744 --> 1:11:04.071
But when he's zooted off of that shit,
he gets you where you need to be.

1:11:04.073 --> 1:11:06.855
Look, dog. You're gonna need
some cash for the splash.

1:11:06.857 --> 1:11:08.742
That's gonna cush the landing.

1:11:08.744 --> 1:11:11.399
- Yes, sir.
- Well, what can I say, Lounge?

1:11:11.401 --> 1:11:14.216
We shall meet again on
some distant shore, my friend.

1:11:15.817 --> 1:11:17.382
Yeah...

1:11:17.384 --> 1:11:19.527
The sun, the rain
and the motherfucking moon.

1:11:19.529 --> 1:11:21.959
- You make us proud down there, you hear me?
- Time for liftoff.

1:11:21.961 --> 1:11:23.207
Lounge, time for liftoff.

1:11:23.209 --> 1:11:24.966
Be good and be good at it, man.

1:11:24.968 --> 1:11:28.679
When I smoking enough weed
and drink the shroom tea...

1:11:28.681 --> 1:11:32.390
A few lines of
dainty white Bogotá coca.

1:11:32.392 --> 1:11:34.278
- Yeah.
- Shit!

1:11:34.280 --> 1:11:36.870
Man. Woof, woof, man.

1:11:36.872 --> 1:11:39.527
I get insane vision.

1:11:39.529 --> 1:11:42.375
And the vision guide,
like a spirit...

1:11:42.377 --> 1:11:46.182
- in a direct line to our final destination.
- Yeah.

1:11:46.184 --> 1:11:49.158
Safe and sound,
I don't fuck around.

1:11:49.160 --> 1:11:53.993
You know, it doesn't matter what you said, it
just sounds so good when you fucking say it.

1:11:55.432 --> 1:11:57.001
You know I'm 98 percent blind?

1:11:57.800 --> 1:11:58.793
It's perfect.

1:12:24.745 --> 1:12:29.126
- They don't even know, man.
- Moondog, what you got?

1:12:29.128 --> 1:12:32.583
Flying through the
slipstream with a whole lot of green.

1:12:34.888 --> 1:12:36.902
Moondog, I love you.

1:12:36.904 --> 1:12:37.832
I love you too.

1:12:38.953 --> 1:12:40.073
What's up, Moondog?

1:12:42.953 --> 1:12:44.969
Get 'em, man!

1:12:52.297 --> 1:12:54.918
Honey, I'm home.

1:13:03.272 --> 1:13:05.670
My dream wife,
this is my Cuban maid.

1:13:05.672 --> 1:13:09.735
- Oh, I see. Got to get me some of that.
- Let's get the party started.

1:13:09.737 --> 1:13:11.816
- Your health.
- <i>Salud.</i>

1:13:44.072 --> 1:13:45.064
Moondog!

1:14:05.960 --> 1:14:08.391
<i>Thank you
for meeting with me today.</i>

1:14:08.393 --> 1:14:11.078
<i>My pleasure. I don't remember
the last time I did one of these.</i>

1:14:11.080 --> 1:14:12.742
What an interesting life.

1:14:12.744 --> 1:14:14.759
How did you pull it off?
How did you do it?

1:14:14.761 --> 1:14:16.806
How did I pull it off?
How did I do it?

1:14:18.664 --> 1:14:19.974
I mean, look, I could tell you

1:14:19.976 --> 1:14:22.439
that I've been trying to uncover

1:14:22.441 --> 1:14:26.150
the abyss beneath my illusory
connection with the world.

1:14:26.152 --> 1:14:28.518
I could tell you that
it's all written in the stars.

1:14:28.520 --> 1:14:31.974
<i>I could tell you
that I'm a reverse paranoiac.</i>

1:14:31.976 --> 1:14:35.207
<i>I am quite certain that the world
is conspiring to make me happy.</i>

1:14:35.209 --> 1:14:38.984
<i>All three of which are true but
it's really simpler than that.</i>

1:14:40.840 --> 1:14:42.152
I like to have fun, man.

1:14:42.760 --> 1:14:44.777
Fun is the fucking gun, man.

1:14:47.657 --> 1:14:52.199
That is why I like boats. I like water.
I like sunshine. I like beautiful women.

1:14:52.201 --> 1:14:54.054
<i>A lot.</i>

1:14:54.056 --> 1:14:56.327
<i>I get all these things going, man,
and they are all turning me on.</i>

1:14:56.329 --> 1:14:58.151
And my wires are
connecting upstairs

1:14:58.153 --> 1:15:00.038
and I start to hear music
in my head.

1:15:00.040 --> 1:15:02.726
<i>You know, and the world is
reverberating back and forth</i>

1:15:02.728 --> 1:15:05.063
<i>and I hit the frequency
and I start to dance to it.</i>

1:15:05.065 --> 1:15:09.673
My fingers get moving, my head gets soupy,
I'm spinning all over the fucking place,

1:15:10.760 --> 1:15:12.392
and the fucking words come out.

1:15:13.352 --> 1:15:15.337
It is like it's a fucking gift.

1:15:16.168 --> 1:15:19.400
What makes you, Moondog,
different than all these other people?

1:15:22.856 --> 1:15:25.993
Seriously? You mean the ones
up north on the mainland,

1:15:26.984 --> 1:15:30.887
the ones racing to the red line,
the ones stuck in their ways,

1:15:30.889 --> 1:15:34.889
a little bit too busy to check
in and say, howdy-howdy-doo?

1:15:35.497 --> 1:15:37.830
That shit's not for me, man.

1:15:37.832 --> 1:15:41.030
I mean, fuck, man, so many people trip
themselves when they're running downhill.

1:15:41.032 --> 1:15:43.302
<i>Life's hard enough. Why would
you fucking want to do that?</i>

1:15:43.304 --> 1:15:45.095
<i>I mean, it's like,
we're here to have a good time.</i>

1:15:45.097 --> 1:15:48.198
<i>I just want to have a good time
until this shit's over, man.</i>

1:15:48.200 --> 1:15:52.134
This life gig's a fucking rodeo,
and I'm gonna suck the nectar out of it.

1:15:52.136 --> 1:15:54.440
Fuck it raw dog
until the wheels come off.

1:15:55.753 --> 1:15:56.999
Let me ask you something.

1:15:57.001 --> 1:15:58.889
- Off the record.
- Come on. Come on.

1:15:59.753 --> 1:16:02.184
What's up
with the women's clothes?

1:16:02.857 --> 1:16:04.487
What women's clothes?

1:16:04.489 --> 1:16:06.471
Motherfucker, my phone was dead.

1:16:06.473 --> 1:16:08.487
I held a funeral
for that motherfucker.

1:16:08.489 --> 1:16:11.782
I had people giving speeches
and remembrance

1:16:11.784 --> 1:16:16.263
of the time when my phone was
alive but it is back to life.

1:16:16.265 --> 1:16:21.798
It has resurrected
and the phone is ringing!

1:16:21.800 --> 1:16:23.240
Off the hook!

1:16:24.520 --> 1:16:27.208
They are calling you motherfucking
Van Gogh with words, baby.

1:16:27.593 --> 1:16:29.351
They call on you Walt Disney.

1:16:29.353 --> 1:16:31.110
They want to freeze your
motherfucking brain when you die.

1:16:31.112 --> 1:16:34.088
This say your new book
is a masterpiece, Moondog.

1:16:34.472 --> 1:16:38.886
But he was acting like
a little fuckboy for a minute.

1:16:38.888 --> 1:16:43.974
And I had to admit, true genius
takes true guidance.

1:16:43.976 --> 1:16:45.577
It takes true pushing.

1:16:46.057 --> 1:16:47.912
Let me tell you something.

1:16:48.776 --> 1:16:52.360
Please tell me something,
tell me something.

1:16:53.992 --> 1:16:56.168
You up
for a motherfucking Pulitzer.

1:16:56.840 --> 1:16:59.142
- My book's up for a Pulitzer?
- Pulitzer.

1:17:01.640 --> 1:17:03.913
Minnie-Boo, do you hear this?

1:17:05.129 --> 1:17:06.695
Thank you.

1:17:06.697 --> 1:17:09.767
And now the prize
for outstanding poetry.

1:17:09.769 --> 1:17:13.638
It is a great honor
that I introduce to you,

1:17:13.640 --> 1:17:16.040
Mr. Moondog.

1:17:25.385 --> 1:17:26.761
Thank you.

1:17:44.872 --> 1:17:46.217
I've had a lot in my life.

1:17:47.720 --> 1:17:50.216
But I always had this feeling
like when I left...

1:17:52.808 --> 1:17:54.632
no one gonna remember me.

1:17:57.673 --> 1:18:01.609
But knowing you,
being a part of what you did...

1:18:04.360 --> 1:18:06.024
maybe that means something,
you know?

1:18:10.441 --> 1:18:11.912
I want to thank you.

1:18:27.689 --> 1:18:30.152
You know what I like
the most about being rich?

1:18:31.561 --> 1:18:37.991
You can just be horrible to people
and they just have to take it.

1:18:44.456 --> 1:18:45.737
This next poem...

1:18:46.568 --> 1:18:49.673
is one I wrote at 3:00 a.m.

1:18:51.464 --> 1:18:55.912
coming down off of a two-day
acid trip in the Virgin Islands.

1:18:58.024 --> 1:18:59.688
It's called
"The Beautiful Point."

1:19:03.721 --> 1:19:05.448
"I go to bed in Havana...

1:19:06.632 --> 1:19:07.913
thinking about you...

1:19:10.664 --> 1:19:12.809
<i>pissing a few moments ago...</i>

1:19:14.729 --> 1:19:18.920
I looked down
at my penis with affection...

1:19:21.832 --> 1:19:23.881
knowing it has been inside you,

1:19:24.361 --> 1:19:25.832
twice today...

1:19:29.257 --> 1:19:30.793
makes me feel beautiful.

1:20:01.705 --> 1:20:04.295
I have to admit, I didn't
think you could do it, Dad.

1:20:04.297 --> 1:20:05.513
No?

1:20:06.280 --> 1:20:08.391
But you managed
to pull it off somehow.

1:20:08.393 --> 1:20:12.744
Sweetie, I'm telling you,
don't ever bet against the Moondog.

1:20:16.552 --> 1:20:19.494
I'm just so happy
you finally dumped limp dick.

1:20:19.496 --> 1:20:20.742
<i>I know. He sucked.</i>

1:20:20.744 --> 1:20:21.737
- <i>Really?</i>
- <i>Yeah.</i>

1:20:34.760 --> 1:20:36.296
You unlocked the fortune.

1:20:36.937 --> 1:20:38.375
The money is yours.

1:20:38.377 --> 1:20:40.902
Your complete inheritance
is all yours.

1:20:40.904 --> 1:20:43.110
- Congratulations.
- Exactly. Perfect.

1:20:43.112 --> 1:20:45.638
Listen.
I want it all in cash, man.

1:20:45.640 --> 1:20:47.814
- What was that?
- Cash, man.

1:20:47.816 --> 1:20:50.438
C-A-S-H, cash, all greenbacks.

1:20:50.440 --> 1:20:52.998
I don't want you to put a penny
of that stuff in the bank.

1:20:53.000 --> 1:20:55.878
You know, I don't trust
those Illuminati motherfuckers.

1:20:55.880 --> 1:20:59.111
Here's what you're gonna do.
I want you to buy me a sailboat.

1:20:59.113 --> 1:21:01.191
<i>All right,
like a 150-200-footer,</i>

1:21:01.193 --> 1:21:03.782
something really nice,
preferably vintage.

1:21:03.784 --> 1:21:06.758
Then I want you to name that boat <i>Success</i>
after my old friend, Captain Whack.

1:21:06.760 --> 1:21:11.302
<i>Then you're gonna put the rest of
the cash stacked in that sailboat.</i>

1:21:11.304 --> 1:21:13.542
And I want you
to sail down here to me.

1:21:13.544 --> 1:21:16.998
<i>That's over
$50 million in cash, Moondog.</i>

1:21:17.000 --> 1:21:18.505
All right, don't fuck it up.

1:21:22.153 --> 1:21:25.223
Next, she's gonna want to marry
me now that I'm rich. Right?

1:21:25.225 --> 1:21:28.167
Huh? That's right.
What do you think about that, huh?

1:21:28.169 --> 1:21:29.798
Cash in a boat.

1:21:29.800 --> 1:21:31.462
You can do whatever we want
or nothing at all.

1:21:33.640 --> 1:21:35.015
Yeah, man.

1:21:35.017 --> 1:21:37.415
- There she is.
- Yeah, it's beautiful.

1:21:37.417 --> 1:21:40.775
- Awesome, man, awesome.
- Got great shapes and her cargo,

1:21:40.777 --> 1:21:43.431
there's $46 million on board.

1:21:43.433 --> 1:21:46.792
You're gonna buy yourself so much weed.
