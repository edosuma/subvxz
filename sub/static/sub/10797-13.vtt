Captain's log, star date 41242.4.
Our last assignment has taken us

00:08.321 --> 00:11.277
into the remote
Omicron Theta star system,

00:11.409 --> 00:14.365
home of our android crew member,
Lt. Cmdr Data.

00:14.497 --> 00:16.906
Although we're due at an assignment,

00:17.043 --> 00:20.794
I have decided to visit Data's
home planet for a few hours

00:20.924 --> 00:24.876
in the hopes of unravelling
the mystery of his beginnings.

00:25.515 --> 00:29.182
Sir, we are 20 minutes
from Omicron Theta, mark.

00:30.481 --> 00:33.899
Stand by for sub warp.
Head for standard orbit of planet.

00:34.029 --> 00:38.111
- I wonder why Data's not here.
- He said he wanted to be alone.

00:38.244 --> 00:41.661
Perhaps this is a bigger moment
for him than we thought.

00:43.000 --> 00:49.074

contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

00:52.391 --> 00:55.394
- What are you doing?
- Sneezing.

00:56.397 --> 00:59.519
- Have you got a cold?
- A cold what?

00:59.653 --> 01:02.525
It's a disease
Mom said people used to get.

01:03.325 --> 01:06.411
But humans still sneeze
for other reasons.

01:06.539 --> 01:09.031
And I cannot seem to do it right.

01:12.173 --> 01:17.763
Why practise sneezing? We're going to
your home planet for the first time.

01:17.890 --> 01:21.760
- Aren't you interested in that?
- More than interested. Fascinated.

01:21.896 --> 01:25.683
One might say agog.
But I also find sneezing interesting.

01:29.659 --> 01:32.946
Capt Picard wishes
to see you on the bridge.

01:33.790 --> 01:37.707
Captain, confirming Class-M
reading there.

01:37.838 --> 01:41.126
But sensors show no life readings.
Not even vegetation.

01:41.261 --> 01:45.213
Strange. The cruiser
that found Data reported farmlands.

01:46.561 --> 01:50.775
- Want to take her into orbit, Data?
- No, thank you, sir.

02:14.271 --> 02:17.227
Continue on into close parking orbit.

02:17.360 --> 02:18.558
Aye, sir.

02:19.446 --> 02:21.773
I could say
"home sweet home", sir,

02:21.909 --> 02:24.911
if I understood how
the word "sweet" applies.

02:25.039 --> 02:29.335
- It usually refers to memories.
- To one's own memories.

02:29.462 --> 02:32.465
Do the memories you have
include farms, Data?

02:32.592 --> 02:36.509
Affirmative. But the colony's
principal interest was science.

02:36.640 --> 02:39.976
How can you hold the memories
of 411 people,

02:40.104 --> 02:43.689
if that means every experience,
every day of their life?

02:43.818 --> 02:48.567
It does not. Unfortunately.
It's the knowledge they accumulated.

02:48.701 --> 02:52.155
Actually, I am deficient
in basic human information.

02:52.290 --> 02:54.284
Sneezing, for example.

02:54.961 --> 02:57.251
Approaching close parking orbit.

02:57.382 --> 03:00.005
Assemble your away party, Commander.

03:01.388 --> 03:04.426
This must be exciting for you.

03:04.560 --> 03:08.940
I'm tempted to lead the away team,
but my First Officer may object.

03:09.067 --> 03:13.198
What would Starfleet say?
An Earth colony did disappear there.

03:13.324 --> 03:14.487
You see?

03:16.662 --> 03:18.822
Now in close parking orbit, sir.

03:19.208 --> 03:23.160
Mr. Data,... welcome home.

03:47.253 --> 03:50.374
Space, the final frontier.

03:52.052 --> 03:56.004
These are the voyages
of the Starship Enterprise.

03:56.142 --> 04:00.273
Its continuing mission,
to explore strange new worlds,...

04:02.068 --> 04:05.771
..to seek out new life
and new civilizations,...

04:06.659 --> 04:10.361
..to boldly go
where no one has gone before.

05:14.100 --> 05:17.516
First Officer's log, star date 4124.5.

05:17.646 --> 05:19.852
We have found Data's home

05:19.982 --> 05:21.939
to be a completely dead world.

05:22.067 --> 05:26.445
Lifeless vegetation, no insects,
not even soil bacteria.

05:26.573 --> 05:30.487
What is it that could kill
everything on an entire planet?

05:35.750 --> 05:38.954
Recording signal
locked onto the Enterprise, sir.

05:39.088 --> 05:41.708
This looks like anything
but farmland.

05:41.840 --> 05:43.003
Agreed, sir.

05:43.675 --> 05:47.045
The soil appears
almost completely lifeless.

05:47.180 --> 05:51.344
This is the position in
the Tripoli log. Recognize anything?

05:51.476 --> 05:53.553
The land contours are familiar.

05:53.687 --> 05:56.475
Topographically,
this is the correct area.

05:56.606 --> 06:00.652
This once was rich farmland,
I'd say 20 to 30 years ago.

06:00.779 --> 06:03.234
I was discovered 26 years ago.

06:03.364 --> 06:08.739
I'd say that everything was dead
or dying at the time Data was found.

06:08.871 --> 06:11.991
I was found 20 meters
in that direction, sir.

06:18.673 --> 06:23.003
Data, any idea why you were given
the colonists' memories?

06:23.137 --> 06:25.295
I feel that it was done hurriedly,

06:25.431 --> 06:27.673
but I know little more. Here.

06:27.809 --> 06:30.514
This is where the cruiser's
landing party

06:30.646 --> 06:33.646
found the signal device
that led them here.

06:35.276 --> 06:38.360
And they found me lying there.

06:42.367 --> 06:44.775
You were just lying in the open?

06:44.911 --> 06:47.783
No identity record,
no instructions?

06:48.416 --> 06:50.290
Only a layer of dust.

06:50.418 --> 06:52.791
What's the first thing you remember?

06:52.921 --> 06:55.209
Opening my eyes.

06:55.340 --> 06:58.674
Looking into the eyes
of the Tripoli landing party.

06:58.802 --> 07:00.961
They believed the signal device

07:01.097 --> 07:03.802
sensed their presence
and activated me.

07:03.933 --> 07:06.887
Then this spot was your birthplace.

07:08.229 --> 07:09.475
Commander.

07:11.775 --> 07:14.647
I think I've got
this place figured out.

07:14.778 --> 07:17.186
This was very cleverly done

07:17.323 --> 07:21.073
to make this look like
a natural hollow in the terrain.

07:21.203 --> 07:24.120
There are signs
it was constructed in a hurry,

07:24.248 --> 07:26.075
as if to hide something.

07:26.208 --> 07:29.459
Yes. That was it, Geordi.

07:29.588 --> 07:31.711
This awakens a memory remnant.

07:31.840 --> 07:34.675
The colonists
hoped to remain hidden.

07:34.801 --> 07:37.554
But their fear of being discovered...

07:38.139 --> 07:40.974
..led to their storing information
in me.

07:43.227 --> 07:45.220
Yeah! Thought so.

08:14.930 --> 08:17.636
No life readings in here either, sir.

09:17.042 --> 09:20.578
The colonists' laboratory.
Extremely well equipped.

09:20.714 --> 09:22.706
Does this stir any memories?

09:22.841 --> 09:27.088
Only a vague impression of some
of my functions being tested here.

09:32.810 --> 09:34.767
Posted by proud parents?

09:35.814 --> 09:39.729
It depicts...
something that feels familiar, sir.

09:39.860 --> 09:41.235
And dangerous.

09:41.862 --> 09:44.650
But I have no idea
what it represents.

09:45.366 --> 09:47.026
And that is all.

09:47.994 --> 09:49.536
Except...

09:50.330 --> 09:52.619
..for an impression...

09:53.167 --> 09:57.959
..of this being
a Dr. Soong's work area.

09:58.088 --> 09:59.038
Who?

09:59.173 --> 10:02.589
- Dr. Noonien Soong?
- He was called that here.

10:02.719 --> 10:05.970
But he travelled here
under a different name.

10:06.098 --> 10:10.346
Dr. Soong, my friend, was Earth's
foremost robotic scientist.

10:10.478 --> 10:14.227
Until he tried to realize Asimov's
dream of a positronic brain.

10:14.357 --> 10:18.225
A positronic brain.
He promised so much.

10:18.362 --> 10:22.574
Then, when he failed completely,
Dr. Soong disappeared.

10:22.700 --> 10:26.199
Now we know he went somewhere
to try a second time.

10:26.329 --> 10:29.034
Data, Geordi, we'll look at this lab.

10:29.166 --> 10:31.918
You and Lt. Worf
reconnoiter the corridors.

10:32.044 --> 10:33.075
Aye, sir.

11:05.456 --> 11:07.663
Data, it's you.

11:08.418 --> 11:10.078
An epidermal mould.

11:10.212 --> 11:13.048
To give your exterior
the desired finish.

11:13.174 --> 11:16.258
- Lt. Yar to Cmdr Riker.
- Come in, Lieutenant.

11:16.385 --> 11:19.886
Sir, this installation
can hold hundreds of people.

11:20.015 --> 11:22.222
But all that's here is empty beds.

11:22.351 --> 11:25.851
Thank you. Complete your record scans
and report back.

11:25.980 --> 11:30.109
Cmdr Riker, looks like
some sort of storage area.

11:47.171 --> 11:50.754
- How many more Datas are there?
- Looks like just two.

11:50.883 --> 11:54.419
I mean, that and the real Data.

12:07.444 --> 12:08.772
Commander,...

12:09.863 --> 12:12.105
..can this be another me?

12:14.035 --> 12:15.908
Or possibly my brother?

12:17.204 --> 12:19.244
I honestly don't know, Data.

12:21.793 --> 12:24.914
- He needs assembling.
- He?

12:25.881 --> 12:30.757
Data, we don't know
that this can become alive.

12:32.138 --> 12:35.305
It is very important
for me to know, sir.

12:36.518 --> 12:40.813
I never dreamed it was possible
that I might find some link...

12:41.482 --> 12:43.689
..with a form like my own.

12:44.319 --> 12:48.234
Understood. We'll take it back
to the ship with us.

12:55.290 --> 12:59.335
Captain's log, star date 41242.45.

12:59.461 --> 13:03.506
Despite having only a few hours
to explore Data's home planet,

13:03.632 --> 13:07.630
we discovered something which
may explain Data's beginnings,

13:07.762 --> 13:12.757
if we can properly assemble and
communicate with what we've found.

13:47.432 --> 13:51.430
Signal from the Captain.
They need you at the debriefing.

13:52.438 --> 13:56.270
I have been anxious to hear
the Chief Engineer's opinion.

13:56.401 --> 13:59.023
Do you believe
he can be made to function?

13:59.153 --> 14:02.024
It includes
all the components in your body.

14:02.157 --> 14:05.278
Not that we fully understand
your construction.

14:05.411 --> 14:09.705
We have our top specialists
working on its construction.

14:10.708 --> 14:12.167
Just one thing.

14:12.293 --> 14:16.706
Without disassembling you, of course,
if we should need more...

14:18.634 --> 14:24.222
If we need to compare this with
the way... you're put together...

14:27.560 --> 14:30.646
Bringing it here was right,
Number One.

14:33.067 --> 14:37.813
Data, if your duplicate functions,
it may answer a lot of questions.

14:42.328 --> 14:44.451
Does it appear to have...

14:45.331 --> 14:47.288
..all your parts?

14:47.416 --> 14:49.208
Completely, sir.

14:49.335 --> 14:50.830
Will...

14:52.965 --> 14:55.088
Will we know how to turn it on?

14:55.217 --> 14:57.091
Alright.

14:59.764 --> 15:03.549
Legitimate questions
need not be asked apologetically.

15:03.685 --> 15:06.355
You feel uncomfortable about
your duplicate.

15:06.479 --> 15:10.063
We feel uncomfortable, too,
for no logical reason.

15:10.193 --> 15:13.359
If it's awkward to be reminded
that Data is a machine,

15:13.487 --> 15:17.817
remember that we are merely
a different variety of machine.

15:17.951 --> 15:20.359
In our case, electrochemical.

15:20.496 --> 15:23.533
Let's handle this
as we would anything else.

15:23.666 --> 15:25.042
Agreed, Captain.

15:25.168 --> 15:27.042
Let's begin with you, Data.

15:27.170 --> 15:30.753
Well, sir,
a good starting point may be

15:30.882 --> 15:33.171
why was I given human form?

15:33.302 --> 15:37.216
To make it easier for humans
to relate to you.

15:37.348 --> 15:40.303
Maybe your designer had
something else to prove.

15:40.435 --> 15:44.896
That human-shaped robots
need not be clumsy or limited.

15:45.024 --> 15:47.266
You operate as well as we do, Data.

15:47.402 --> 15:49.145
Better, in some ways, sir.

15:50.822 --> 15:55.283
Look at this. Could be a link to
the disappearance of the colonists.

15:55.410 --> 15:59.539
It was displayed in the lab.
It could be a child's imagination,

15:59.665 --> 16:02.335
but several children
did similar drawings.

16:04.045 --> 16:06.501
Dr. Crusher to the Captain.

16:06.631 --> 16:09.384
We very much need Mr. Data's help.

16:12.262 --> 16:14.006
He's on his way, Doctor.

16:19.980 --> 16:23.563
Is the synthomometer
reading positive or negative?

16:24.652 --> 16:26.479
Press your fingers there.

16:30.826 --> 16:32.070
There.

16:33.578 --> 16:35.701
It operates almost as a switch.

16:37.333 --> 16:39.540
And these small projections?

16:40.211 --> 16:42.369
An android alarm clock.

16:43.465 --> 16:45.374
Is that amusing?

16:47.386 --> 16:50.672
They time how long
I remain unconscious.

16:50.807 --> 16:54.390
Are you certain about us using
these heating devices?

16:54.519 --> 16:57.520
- I will feel nothing at all.
- Marvellous.

16:57.647 --> 17:01.895
It should be simpler once we see
how your circuitry is connected.

17:07.450 --> 17:11.579
I won't mention it to anyone.
You have my word.

17:11.704 --> 17:14.375
If you had an off switch, Doctor,...

17:14.916 --> 17:17.289
..would you not keep it secret?

17:18.839 --> 17:20.582
I guess I would.

17:33.104 --> 17:36.520
Notice the micro-circuitry here.
And here.

17:38.777 --> 17:42.229
And another fibroid-like
connection here.

17:43.783 --> 17:45.692
Let's close up.

17:57.549 --> 18:01.214
It seemed to go well,
thanks to a look inside Mr. Data.

18:01.345 --> 18:04.097
But there are no
signs of consciousness yet.

18:12.232 --> 18:14.937
It certainly is
a good match for Data.

18:15.069 --> 18:17.773
Do you think so, really?

18:18.656 --> 18:20.945
I wonder which was made first.

18:22.493 --> 18:23.822
He was.

18:27.124 --> 18:31.833
But they found him to be imperfect,
and I was made to replace him.

18:39.638 --> 18:41.631
You may call me Lore.

18:52.111 --> 18:57.402
But I am also troubled by
it describing you as imperfect.

18:57.533 --> 19:00.025
Human language
gives me difficulty, too.

19:00.161 --> 19:03.365
It could mean I lack certain
abilities he possesses.

19:03.498 --> 19:04.827
I wonder.

19:04.959 --> 19:10.297
But the point is, whether you and it
have the same capabilities.

19:10.423 --> 19:14.551
We do, sir.
And your referring to him as "it"

19:14.677 --> 19:19.221
suggests that l, too,
fit into the category of a thing.

19:21.101 --> 19:22.644
I see your point.

19:23.563 --> 19:25.106
My apologies.

19:25.231 --> 19:26.809
Gladly accepted, sir.

19:26.942 --> 19:29.859
As for Lore's abilities,
his syntax and grammar

19:29.986 --> 19:32.988
suggests he was given
human memories like mine.

19:33.115 --> 19:36.116
You have equal strength
and mental abilities?

19:36.243 --> 19:37.573
I believe so, sir.

19:37.704 --> 19:41.536
Which requires that I now ask
a very serious question.

19:41.667 --> 19:46.460
Since the two of you are so
closely related to each other...

19:46.589 --> 19:50.005
The answer, sir,
is that my loyalty is to you.

19:50.135 --> 19:52.460
And Starfleet. Completely.

19:55.099 --> 19:58.764
Thank you, Commander.
I was certain of that.

19:59.270 --> 20:04.266
Helm control is here. The ship's
heading is given in degrees.

20:04.400 --> 20:07.437
360 of them
in a full circle this way.

20:07.571 --> 20:09.897
- Then you say "mark".
- On the nose.

20:10.032 --> 20:13.615
That separates it from another
360-degree circle this way

20:13.744 --> 20:15.951
on a right angle to this one.

20:16.081 --> 20:18.833
By ordering a heading
so many degrees this way

20:18.959 --> 20:20.786
and so many this way,

20:20.920 --> 20:24.170
the ship can travel
in all three dimensions.

20:24.298 --> 20:26.872
The square of the hypotenuse
of a right triangle?

20:27.010 --> 20:30.710
Is equal to the sum of the square
of the other two...

20:30.847 --> 20:32.804
..something.

20:32.933 --> 20:35.970
Which I once heard,
but never understood.

20:36.103 --> 20:41.015
You'll learn more when the Captain
approves your being on the bridge.

20:41.151 --> 20:42.943
Have I committed an offence?

20:43.070 --> 20:47.317
You will find many rules on
starships that must be learnt.

20:48.367 --> 20:50.241
You're very clever, Wesley.

20:50.369 --> 20:53.075
I now have duties to perform.
Correct?

20:53.206 --> 20:56.208
Were you ever this anxious
to please, Data?

20:56.335 --> 21:00.547
Never. I judge Lore
to be superior in that desire.

21:00.673 --> 21:04.339
Because I was designed to be
so human, my brother.

21:04.469 --> 21:06.426
I enjoy pleasing humans.

21:06.555 --> 21:11.348
"My brother".
That has a nice sound to it, Data.

21:11.477 --> 21:14.727
You consider it important
to please humans?

21:14.855 --> 21:16.765
It's not important?

21:17.943 --> 21:21.775
There are many things of importance.
Some more than others.

21:36.839 --> 21:39.794
Cmdr Riker's hypotenuse question
tricked you

21:39.926 --> 21:44.174
into showing your knowledge was
greater than you were indicating.

21:44.305 --> 21:47.675
He didn't seem that clever.
I'll be more careful.

21:47.810 --> 21:50.681
You tend to underestimate humans.

21:50.812 --> 21:53.565
Praising young Wesley on the helm...

21:53.691 --> 21:54.937
A child!

21:55.068 --> 21:59.646
He has a child's body. But we
have found him to be much more.

22:01.075 --> 22:04.194
Thank you for that information, too.

22:04.328 --> 22:06.784
You do care about how I perform.

22:06.914 --> 22:10.615
I pledge to be worthy
of your teaching, my brother.

22:10.794 --> 22:13.546
Try not to be jealous
of my abilities.

22:32.485 --> 22:34.810
What information are you requesting?

22:35.530 --> 22:38.864
Everything available
on a Dr. Noonien Soong.

22:40.119 --> 22:42.445
Good old often-wrong Soong.

22:45.249 --> 22:46.958
A joke, brother.

22:47.836 --> 22:51.003
Actually, he was
a genius by human standards.

22:51.882 --> 22:55.963
But he destroyed his reputation
by making wild promises

22:56.095 --> 23:00.757
about his positronic brain design.
Almost all of which failed.

23:00.892 --> 23:03.810
Promises he later proved to be true.

23:05.606 --> 23:08.561
Which made you and me possible,
brother.

23:10.069 --> 23:12.228
Our beloved father!

23:13.865 --> 23:17.567
Will I soon have a uniform
like that, brother?

23:17.703 --> 23:22.412
I got mine after four years
at the Academy, three as ensign,

23:22.542 --> 23:25.579
Ten or 12 on space duties
at lieutenant grade...

23:25.712 --> 23:30.339
A system designed to compensate
for limited human ability.

23:30.468 --> 23:34.846
And you, brother, are beginning
to think as a human.

23:34.973 --> 23:38.674
You and I are completely different
from them.

23:38.810 --> 23:42.511
Are you truly satisfied
with the knowledge and memory

23:42.648 --> 23:45.519
of a few hundred human colonists?

23:45.652 --> 23:50.314
Suppose it could reflect thousands?
Or millions?

23:50.448 --> 23:55.870
Or the knowledge of hundreds of
millions of life forms of every kind?

23:58.750 --> 24:00.244
How?

24:01.211 --> 24:03.120
We will discuss that in time.

24:03.255 --> 24:08.415
And will we also discuss, Lore,
which of us was constructed first?

24:09.011 --> 24:10.386
It would be foolish...

24:11.932 --> 24:14.422
..to underestimate you, brother.

24:14.559 --> 24:18.723
Yes, I lied when I said you were
made first, but with good reason.

24:18.855 --> 24:22.190
Dr. Soong made me perfect
in his first attempt.

24:22.318 --> 24:26.731
But he made me so human,
the colonists became envious of me.

24:26.865 --> 24:29.154
You lived with the colonists?

24:29.951 --> 24:33.866
Until they petitioned Soong
to make a more... comfortable,

24:33.997 --> 24:36.785
less... perfect android.

24:37.544 --> 24:40.628
In other words, you brother.

24:45.052 --> 24:49.513
Haven't you noticed how easily
I handle human speech?

24:49.640 --> 24:51.432
I use their contractions.

24:51.559 --> 24:55.475
For example,
I say "can't" or "isn't".

24:55.605 --> 24:59.058
You say "cannot" and "is not".

25:09.955 --> 25:12.114
A very old joke.

25:12.250 --> 25:16.164
But you also have trouble
with their humour. Am I right?

25:17.380 --> 25:18.923
Quite true.

25:19.049 --> 25:23.546
I keep trying to be more human,
and keep failing.

25:24.680 --> 25:27.801
Do you realize,... brother,...

25:28.726 --> 25:31.396
..l can help you become more human?

25:31.939 --> 25:34.015
And do you realize, Lore,

25:34.150 --> 25:38.278
that I am obligated to report
all this to our ship's Captain?

25:40.073 --> 25:43.987
I assumed as much
when I began studying you.

25:44.995 --> 25:48.945
May I use this to learn more about
this vessel and its customs?

25:49.083 --> 25:52.203
Use it to describe
your time among the colonists,

25:52.336 --> 25:55.504
including all you know
about what happened to them.

25:55.632 --> 26:00.211
I promise a report
of great detail and accuracy.

26:01.221 --> 26:04.757
Thank you, Lore.
I now have duties to perform.

26:09.440 --> 26:11.563
Unless you need something more.

26:11.691 --> 26:15.773
I have more than I dreamed
possible, brother.

26:40.099 --> 26:43.350
Captain's log, star date 41242.5.

26:43.478 --> 26:47.558
Thanks to Lore's report, we now know
what happened to the colonists.

26:47.691 --> 26:51.392
Using a child's drawing,
enhanced by Lore's description,

26:51.528 --> 26:53.771
our computer constructed the image

26:53.906 --> 26:58.118
of a great crystalline entity
which feeds on life,

26:58.244 --> 27:02.112
insatiably ravenous for
the life force in living forms,

27:02.249 --> 27:06.543
capable of stripping all life
from an entire world.

27:06.671 --> 27:10.883
- How did Data escape? Or Lore?
- Lore had been disassembled.

27:11.009 --> 27:13.964
He explained it as jealousy
from the colonists.

27:14.096 --> 27:16.053
Data wasn't yet alive.

27:16.182 --> 27:19.765
Data could be left out
in no danger from that creature.

27:19.894 --> 27:22.101
Whatever happened to the colonists,

27:22.230 --> 27:25.813
he'd be found by the first crew
to respond to his signal.

27:25.942 --> 27:30.237
So Dr. Soong left proof
that his experiment did work.

27:30.364 --> 27:34.742
Captain, how believable
do you find that crystal thing?

27:35.328 --> 27:40.952
With so little of even our galaxy
explored, it is at least possible.

27:41.084 --> 27:44.288
Data, are you expecting Lore
to come up here?

27:44.422 --> 27:47.423
- He left your quarters.
- To go...?

27:47.550 --> 27:50.837
My turbo sensors say
he went to deck four. Worf?

27:50.971 --> 27:55.052
He examined some work tools
and fine-grind quadratanium.

27:55.184 --> 27:57.592
Which is used in our construction.

27:57.729 --> 28:02.273
That compound is no more suspicious
than a human looking for an ointment.

28:02.401 --> 28:04.228
But I should check it out.

28:04.361 --> 28:09.154
You're watching everything he does?
Is that the act of a brother?

28:09.283 --> 28:12.735
It's the act of a Starfleet officer
obeying his Captain.

28:18.168 --> 28:19.580
Captain?

28:20.421 --> 28:23.043
Speaking strictly as Security Chief,

28:23.174 --> 28:25.463
how much can you trust Data now?

28:29.681 --> 28:33.596
I trust him completely.
But everyone should realize

28:33.728 --> 28:37.311
that that was
a legitimate security question.

28:37.440 --> 28:38.851
Thank you, sir.

29:01.551 --> 29:05.051
Lesson number one
in becoming more human.

29:05.180 --> 29:07.849
You must observe all human customs.

29:08.684 --> 29:09.929
Champagne?

29:10.060 --> 29:15.648
An ancient ritual practised when
they observe events of importance.

29:23.450 --> 29:28.493
My brother, I toast
our discovery of each other.

29:28.623 --> 29:31.708
May it fill our lives
with new meaning.

29:37.550 --> 29:43.470
I have some doubts about the value
of human customs... in this...

29:46.811 --> 29:48.186
My brother!

29:49.563 --> 29:53.183
And let us toast, also, Dr. Soong,...

29:53.818 --> 29:58.730
..who gave me the full richness
of human needs and ambitions.

29:58.866 --> 30:03.529
A perfect match for my mind,
my body.

30:03.663 --> 30:05.288
Brother...

30:11.004 --> 30:13.211
And let us toast, also,...

30:14.175 --> 30:19.467
..the Great Crystal Entity,
with whom I learned to communicate.

30:22.434 --> 30:25.139
Before Dr. Soong disassembled me,

30:25.271 --> 30:29.684
I earned its gratitude by
revealing the way to the colonists.

30:29.818 --> 30:34.564
Imagine its gratitude when I give it
the life on this vessel!

30:38.244 --> 30:39.868
This is strange, sir.

30:39.996 --> 30:43.163
I show Cmdr Data transmitting
on a subspace channel.

30:43.292 --> 30:47.290
I know Data's been researching
Dr. Soong's background.

30:47.421 --> 30:49.295
Let's be sure.

30:52.468 --> 30:55.138
Would you look in on Cmdr Data?
Discreetly?

30:55.263 --> 30:56.543
Yes, sir.

31:02.563 --> 31:04.105
Crystal Entity.

31:04.232 --> 31:09.440
Upon arriving here, you can identify
me as the machine named Data.

31:13.075 --> 31:14.617
End of message.

31:14.743 --> 31:16.403
Come in, please.

31:19.833 --> 31:21.541
Glad you are here.

31:21.668 --> 31:24.242
Lore attacked me.
I had to turn him off.

31:24.380 --> 31:26.040
Why did he do that, Data?

31:26.173 --> 31:30.302
He discovered we have been using
sensors to follow what he does.

31:33.973 --> 31:37.011
I practised his facial tic.
Do I have it right?

31:37.561 --> 31:39.968
I'd suggest you forget
imitating him.

31:40.940 --> 31:44.391
If you'd said "we've"
instead of "we have",

31:44.527 --> 31:46.935
I might have
suspected you were Lore.

31:47.072 --> 31:51.070
Yes. I do use language
more formally than Lore.

31:51.201 --> 31:54.322
Please inform the Captain
I will come to report this.

31:55.247 --> 31:56.327
Aye, sir.

32:58.111 --> 33:03.069
Wes, tell me again how Data said
he immobilized Lore.

33:05.327 --> 33:09.539
He told me he just turned him off,
Mom. Doctor.

33:14.421 --> 33:16.081
Question, Mr. Data.

33:16.214 --> 33:20.295
Did you not swear me to secrecy
about your off switch?

33:21.137 --> 33:22.679
A change of mind.

33:22.805 --> 33:26.092
If I cannot trust the bridge crew,
whom can l?

33:27.853 --> 33:31.103
Captain, bogey coming in
on a five o'clock tangent.

33:31.607 --> 33:33.101
No ID signal, Captain.

33:33.233 --> 33:36.520
- Main viewer on tangent.
- Shields up. Yellow alert.

33:36.654 --> 33:39.691
Friendly greetings all languages,
all frequencies.

33:43.621 --> 33:46.194
I can't believe it can overtake us
this fast.

33:46.332 --> 33:48.324
Beautiful, isn't it?

33:52.630 --> 33:54.125
I recognize it, sir.

33:54.508 --> 33:56.963
It's the crystal image
Lore described.

34:00.056 --> 34:01.847
My God!

34:15.657 --> 34:17.815
Still no ID, sir.

34:17.951 --> 34:20.110
Also no answer to our inquiries.

34:23.331 --> 34:24.956
Did you get a direct look?

34:25.085 --> 34:27.918
It's like a giant snowflake,
but more complex.

34:28.045 --> 34:31.498
The entire electromagnetic spectrum
is inside it.

34:31.634 --> 34:35.168
- But I've no idea what it is.
- Thank you. Data.

34:37.181 --> 34:41.310
Anything else that Lore could tell us
may be important.

34:41.436 --> 34:45.018
- Can you control and question him?
- I must examine him.

34:46.859 --> 34:52.446
Captain. Recommend that you do not
let him roam the ship freely.

34:52.574 --> 34:53.688
Ensign?

34:53.824 --> 34:56.826
Wesley is being alert
and responsible.

34:56.954 --> 35:00.821
Something to be encouraged. Come.
You can watch everything I do.

35:00.958 --> 35:02.500
Not if I have a choice.

35:02.626 --> 35:05.664
Enough! When addressing
a senior officer...

35:05.797 --> 35:07.790
As his trainer, it's my fault.

35:07.925 --> 35:12.219
You will show proper respect.
I will accompany you to make certain.

35:12.346 --> 35:14.304
With your approval, sir.

35:32.577 --> 35:34.405
Be careful of Lore.

35:35.038 --> 35:37.993
Good. He is still unconscious.

35:38.626 --> 35:42.077
Notice the same twitch,
even though he is unconscious?

35:42.714 --> 35:47.507
Stay back. We may have problems
if he senses someone else is near.

35:55.395 --> 35:57.767
I have a few questions
to ask you.

35:59.149 --> 36:00.809
Lore, it is Data!

36:01.527 --> 36:04.813
He senses you.
I cannot control him if you stay.

36:04.948 --> 36:06.905
I will record what he says.

36:07.033 --> 36:09.192
Bring it to the bridge immediately.

36:18.171 --> 36:22.667
And you want to be as stupid
as them, dear brother?

36:38.360 --> 36:41.564
- Well, Number One?
- It was Lore, sir.

36:41.698 --> 36:43.358
Same facial twitch.

36:43.491 --> 36:46.065
Lying unconscious as Data described.

36:46.203 --> 36:49.702
It became violent, apparently
sensing Wesley and l...

36:49.832 --> 36:53.082
Or is it Lore pretending
to be Data and faking it?

36:53.210 --> 36:56.746
I asked for Cmdr Riker's report,
Acting Ensign Crusher.

36:56.881 --> 37:00.381
If you can't accept the limits
of that appointment...

37:00.510 --> 37:01.755
Captain!

37:10.438 --> 37:12.266
Deflector shields holding.

37:12.399 --> 37:16.977
Torpedoes and main phasers to ready.
Go to red alert, please.

37:20.575 --> 37:22.069
Weapons ready, sir.

37:22.494 --> 37:24.617
No, Captain, let me talk to it.

37:24.746 --> 37:27.035
You didn't say you could do that.

37:32.046 --> 37:35.914
- Affirmative. Talk to it.
- Open hailing frequencies.

37:37.093 --> 37:41.554
Crystal form,
I identify myself as Data.

37:41.682 --> 37:44.518
Advising you to stop your attack.

37:44.644 --> 37:46.720
The humans here are powerful.

37:46.855 --> 37:49.855
Capable of injuring
or even destroying you.

37:57.199 --> 37:59.869
Now, I call that communicating!

37:59.995 --> 38:02.829
Suggest moving fast
to confirm what I told it.

38:02.956 --> 38:06.741
Permission to use the large
transporter in cargo room three

38:06.877 --> 38:10.496
to beam up some living pattern.
Perhaps a large tree.

38:10.632 --> 38:14.297
- Which you'll beam to the entity?
- Correct, Riker.

38:14.427 --> 38:17.631
Ship's phasers
will then disintegrate it,

38:17.764 --> 38:20.136
proving we are dangerous.

38:20.893 --> 38:22.221
Make it so.

38:22.353 --> 38:23.764
Sir?

38:25.941 --> 38:27.269
Do it.

38:34.534 --> 38:38.152
Sir, I know this may finish me
as Acting Ensign...

38:38.288 --> 38:39.865
Shut up, Wesley!

38:42.918 --> 38:47.130
- Let me know what he does.
- Aye, sir.

38:47.256 --> 38:49.249
"Shut up, Wesley"?!

38:49.968 --> 38:51.426
Doctor...

38:52.471 --> 38:55.044
Since I am finished here,
may I say...

38:55.182 --> 38:56.297
Shut up, Wesley!

38:56.434 --> 38:59.885
..that what I have said
would've been listened to

39:00.021 --> 39:02.773
if it came from an adult officer!

39:04.067 --> 39:06.819
Permission to go to my quarters, sir.

39:06.945 --> 39:09.863
Agreed. Doctor, go with him.

39:09.990 --> 39:12.742
You're putting me off the bridge?

39:15.288 --> 39:19.452
I'm asking you to keep an eye
on your son during this.

39:27.760 --> 39:29.669
Emergency, close!

39:31.890 --> 39:34.381
Now, show me your warrior fierceness!

39:53.873 --> 39:58.915
I'll look. But I shouldn't
have let you talk me into this.

39:59.046 --> 40:01.751
It's Data! He's been hurt.

40:06.804 --> 40:11.099
- You know how to turn them on.
- This is very serious!

40:11.643 --> 40:15.060
So, just tell me to
"Shut up, Wesley", and I will.

40:16.274 --> 40:18.313
You're being very unfair, Wes.

40:19.902 --> 40:23.070
Data! The crystal thing
is outside the ship.

40:23.198 --> 40:25.238
Lore is loose on the inside.

40:25.368 --> 40:27.360
How badly are you hurt?

40:27.495 --> 40:31.825
I will function sufficiently...
to stop Lore.

40:36.630 --> 40:38.837
Crystal Entity form,...

40:39.550 --> 40:41.377
..it's your old friend.

40:50.688 --> 40:55.184
Very good.
You've understood perfectly so far.

40:55.318 --> 40:59.019
Next, I will signal that
I'm transporting something out.

40:59.155 --> 41:03.023
The deflector shields
will turn off for a moment,

41:03.160 --> 41:06.078
and if you move in at that time...

41:07.623 --> 41:09.699
How sad, dear brother.

41:10.669 --> 41:13.670
You make me wish
I were an only child.

41:22.349 --> 41:25.018
Then why this marvellous gift?

41:25.769 --> 41:28.521
The troublesome little man-child.

41:29.440 --> 41:33.141
Are you prepared for the death
you've earned, little man?

41:33.278 --> 41:36.729
If you take one more step
towards my son...

41:38.700 --> 41:40.574
Motherhood!

41:43.790 --> 41:48.203
Back off, or I'll turn
your little man into a torch.

41:48.337 --> 41:53.212
I promise him exquisite pain
unless you obey me, too, brother.

41:53.342 --> 41:55.631
Move away, Data. Please!

41:56.846 --> 42:02.185
Do you see now the advantages
of being completely human?

42:03.020 --> 42:04.977
It includes kindness.

42:05.523 --> 42:08.192
I give you your life, Doctor.

42:08.317 --> 42:10.476
Go home. Quickly.

42:11.112 --> 42:13.401
And I may not injure your son at all.

42:13.531 --> 42:15.655
I will stay with Wesley.

42:15.784 --> 42:20.411
Go! Or he'll be shrieking
by the count of five.

42:20.540 --> 42:22.782
One, two,...

42:24.419 --> 42:25.794
..three,...

42:25.920 --> 42:27.830
..four...

42:28.548 --> 42:33.258
Thank you for my human qualities,
Dr. Soong! Wait!

42:34.388 --> 42:37.924
A small payment
for your son's misdeeds.

42:55.788 --> 42:57.247
The transporter!

43:05.090 --> 43:06.419
Wesley, now!

43:25.279 --> 43:27.985
Lore's gone, sir. Permanently.

43:34.749 --> 43:38.617
Doctor, now that Wesley's safe,
go to sickbay at once.

43:38.878 --> 43:42.544
Captain, the crystal thing
has begun to move away.

43:54.229 --> 43:55.688
Are you alright?

43:56.273 --> 43:58.017
Yes, sir. I'm fine.

44:00.111 --> 44:03.693
Get rid of that damn twitch
and put on the correct uniform.

44:04.157 --> 44:05.533
Yes, Captain.

44:06.368 --> 44:09.453
- Are you able to return to duty?
- Yes, sir.

44:09.580 --> 44:13.198
Then do so. Let the bridge know
all is well here.

44:13.334 --> 44:14.614
Aye, sir.

44:18.507 --> 44:22.339
It's gone, sir.
Without Lore, it couldn't reach us.

44:22.470 --> 44:25.008
We're overdue a computer refit.

44:25.138 --> 44:30.561
Do you ever wonder if Data is more
human or less human than we want?

44:31.896 --> 44:34.767
I wish we were all
as well balanced, sir.

44:34.900 --> 44:36.275
Agreed.
