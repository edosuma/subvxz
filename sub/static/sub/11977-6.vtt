00:06.306 --> 00:07.640
Previously on Rogue...

00:07.874 --> 00:09.075
Just making sure.

00:09.376 --> 00:11.210
What the fuck is that?
What the fuck is this?

00:11.212 --> 00:13.746
My girlfriend
is a DEA agent, okay?

00:13.914 --> 00:15.314
I'm sure she'd be proud of you.

00:15.316 --> 00:17.249
You took a risk, saying
those drugs were yours.

00:17.251 --> 00:18.384
You don't believe me, do you?

00:18.386 --> 00:19.985
I think we should
cut ties with Kelly.

00:19.987 --> 00:21.220
He's unpredictable.

00:21.222 --> 00:22.521
What about the father?

00:22.523 --> 00:25.057
Well, Ethan plays fast
and loose with his own life.

00:25.059 --> 00:26.425
What about his dad's?

00:32.866 --> 00:34.500
And what can you tell us
about Adam Hutchings?

00:34.502 --> 00:35.568
Guy called me about

00:35.570 --> 00:36.869
the Crown building,
over on Douglas.

00:36.871 --> 00:38.204
What's so special
about this building?

00:38.206 --> 00:40.506
Nothing.
Six-story residential rental.

00:40.508 --> 00:42.241
Guess we know
why no one buzzed us in.

00:42.243 --> 00:43.709
She knows about the building.

00:43.711 --> 00:45.845
You stupid fuckin' imbecile.

00:45.847 --> 00:47.613
- He didn't tell you 'bout our business?
- Nah.

00:47.615 --> 00:49.281
'Cause we're looking
for investors.

00:49.283 --> 00:51.250
You know, partnership's...
It's expensive.

00:51.252 --> 00:52.785
<i>- How expensive?</i>
<i>- Thirty.</i>

00:52.787 --> 00:54.487
<i>Thirty grand?</i>
<i>I can get that shit easy.</i>

00:55.689 --> 00:56.956
Fuckin' stealing from me?

00:56.958 --> 00:58.090
- Huh?
- Marlon, I can explain.

00:58.092 --> 00:59.592
Obviously, that's all
I am to you, right?

00:59.594 --> 01:00.860
It was Leo!

01:00.862 --> 01:02.328
I got something for you
to take care of tonight.

Who the hell are you?

02:37.223 --> 02:38.757
There's a problem with trust.

02:39.893 --> 02:40.959
Excuse me?

02:43.363 --> 02:45.297
Marty doesn't trust you
anymore, Detective.

02:46.566 --> 02:47.633
That's the problem.

02:49.903 --> 02:51.136
Who the fuck are you?

02:53.573 --> 02:54.673
I work with Marty.

02:56.843 --> 02:58.110
And I'm here to make sure

02:59.112 --> 03:00.679
that you start coming through
for him.

03:02.282 --> 03:03.348
Oh.

03:08.054 --> 03:09.121
You see this?

03:10.523 --> 03:13.425
Do you know what this means,
asshole?

03:14.594 --> 03:16.862
This means I come through

03:17.263 --> 03:19.298
whenever I goddamn please.

03:20.800 --> 03:21.867
You understand?

03:30.643 --> 03:31.777
From now on,

03:32.712 --> 03:33.846
anything you got

03:34.280 --> 03:35.347
for him,

03:35.748 --> 03:36.815
it goes through me.

03:37.817 --> 03:39.284
So I can keep an eye on you.

03:47.627 --> 03:48.794
Call this number.

03:48.796 --> 03:50.696
At turn of
The Century Lighting.

03:51.231 --> 03:53.065
Ask for bulb replacement

03:55.001 --> 03:58.105
on a 40-watt Freedonia.

04:00.240 --> 04:01.640
Forty-watt Freedonia.

04:16.990 --> 04:19.524
Kelly got the jump on me
at the father's grocery store.

04:19.527 --> 04:20.591
I didn't get him.

04:21.293 --> 04:22.861
Jesus fuck, Lloyd.

04:22.863 --> 04:24.263
They took off in his car,

04:24.664 --> 04:26.899
since then, both the father
and the son are MIA.

04:27.333 --> 04:28.400
Then that's that.

04:29.969 --> 04:32.471
We knew using him to go
after Stein was a risk.

04:32.473 --> 04:35.307
Or you couldn't do your job.

04:35.309 --> 04:38.010
Kelly cannot be controlled,
he cannot be contained.

04:38.344 --> 04:40.546
- You knew this. I told you about this...
- Shut up.

04:43.851 --> 04:47.719
Your problem is,
and I mean your problem,

04:48.621 --> 04:50.055
is shutting this down.

04:50.390 --> 04:51.456
You finish him.

04:52.358 --> 04:54.326
And what about Marty Stein?

04:54.328 --> 04:56.728
Well that mission went out the window when
you lost the jump to Kelly, didn't it?

04:57.063 --> 05:00.132
Sir, I can pursue
other avenues.

05:00.533 --> 05:04.036
- Undercover DOJ contacts, IRS, FBI...
- No.

05:04.038 --> 05:09.408
We are done piggybacking Justice's
inquiry into Marty's dirty laundry.

05:09.410 --> 05:12.077
Fine. Well, then,
let me set up alternatives.

05:12.079 --> 05:15.480
You do nothing
in relation to Marty Stein.

05:15.482 --> 05:18.217
Marty Stein is
a domestic terrorist.

05:18.518 --> 05:20.385
Conspiracy, perjury.

05:20.720 --> 05:23.121
He's bribed probably
half of Justice.

05:24.057 --> 05:26.325
He's... What are
we talking about here?

05:26.327 --> 05:27.893
Thanks for the recap.

05:31.497 --> 05:34.666
Unfortunately, it has to wait
until you fix the problem.

05:36.769 --> 05:38.971
Kelly knows
you killed two people.

05:40.540 --> 05:41.740
Can't have that out there.

05:44.077 --> 05:45.143
Button it up.

05:45.378 --> 05:46.445
Got it.

05:47.247 --> 05:48.313
Good.

06:15.475 --> 06:16.541
Look alive.

06:18.911 --> 06:19.945
Who the fuck are you?

06:19.947 --> 06:21.113
Marlon sent me.

06:21.115 --> 06:22.180
- No Cups?
- Nah.

06:22.949 --> 06:24.016
Cups is dead.

06:26.119 --> 06:27.686
Yo, what the fuck?

06:28.087 --> 06:29.354
What about our delivery?

06:39.132 --> 06:40.198
Yo, we got a problem.

06:57.016 --> 07:00.519
You can't have random people showing
up taking delivery, Marlon.

07:00.920 --> 07:02.721
My apologies,
I should have called you.

07:04.157 --> 07:05.857
Had to switch things up
on the fly.

07:07.694 --> 07:10.162
What if I didn't send Ramiro
and didn't call you?

07:11.130 --> 07:13.265
I apologize,
but you can trust Jason.

07:13.267 --> 07:14.833
But I don't know
if I can or not.

07:15.668 --> 07:18.003
Cups proved himself over time.

07:18.638 --> 07:19.705
A long time.

07:20.840 --> 07:22.574
Ordoñez, I run the Kings.

07:24.644 --> 07:25.744
I don't know.

07:26.779 --> 07:28.046
Maybe what I'm hearing is true.

07:28.048 --> 07:29.181
Oh yeah, what's that?

07:30.450 --> 07:31.950
Corners are vulnerable.

07:32.552 --> 07:34.052
That you are vulnerable.

07:36.656 --> 07:38.357
Marlon, I'm gonna be
straight up with you.

07:38.359 --> 07:39.424
Always.

07:40.193 --> 07:41.293
Ty's made me an offer.

07:42.295 --> 07:43.362
Ty?

07:44.530 --> 07:45.797
Ty can't move your product.

07:47.166 --> 07:49.000
They don't have the infrastructure
or the real estate.

07:49.002 --> 07:51.770
Maybe since Cups is gone, you don't
have the real estate you think you do.

07:52.038 --> 07:53.105
You're not out here.

07:54.507 --> 07:56.074
I'm everywhere I need to be.

08:00.581 --> 08:03.949
Give me a week. I'll figure out something
that we both can be satisfied with.

08:05.885 --> 08:06.952
That would be good.

08:08.488 --> 08:11.423
Las Almas Muertas and the Kings
have had a long run together.

08:14.327 --> 08:15.761
Thanks, man, that means a lot.

08:15.763 --> 08:18.830
What it means is I give you
one day to figure shit out.

08:30.276 --> 08:33.611
Angela, I wouldn't ask for a warrant
unless I thought I had something.

08:33.614 --> 08:36.381
Patrick and I were outside the
Crown building for 24 hours

08:36.383 --> 08:37.883
and not a soul came in or out.

08:37.885 --> 08:40.251
That's not probable cause,
that's probable maybe.

08:41.921 --> 08:43.955
- Oh, snap.
- I'm on the toilet.

08:43.957 --> 08:45.657
- Can I get my toothbrush?
- Get out!

08:51.564 --> 08:52.597
Sorry, I'm back.

08:52.599 --> 08:54.166
You never left.
Heard the whole thing.

08:54.534 --> 08:55.667
I didn't know you had a kid.

08:57.103 --> 08:58.170
I don't.

09:03.743 --> 09:04.810
Hey.

09:05.012 --> 09:07.546
I pulled more than a few strings
to get him out of foster care,

09:07.548 --> 09:09.147
but I need some basic privacy.

09:09.482 --> 09:10.949
I mean, I'm not asking much.

09:11.117 --> 09:12.884
What happened?
What happened?

09:12.886 --> 09:14.886
I'm sitting on the toilet and he just
walks in to grab his toothbrush.

09:14.888 --> 09:16.121
No knock. No, "Excuse me."

09:16.123 --> 09:17.556
- He just...
- Aah.

09:18.991 --> 09:20.158
It's not okay.

09:21.661 --> 09:24.062
I'm sorry.
It's definitely... That's not okay, no.

09:24.263 --> 09:27.132
You know I'm all for helping these
kids out, but Jesus Christ.

09:27.134 --> 09:28.667
I'll talk to him.

09:28.669 --> 09:30.168
I'm sorry that happened to you, okay?
I'm gonna talk to him.

09:30.403 --> 09:32.003
Okay?

09:32.005 --> 09:35.240
It's one thing if he's just a lost
soul, but he's also carrying.

09:37.477 --> 09:39.678
I told you, those drugs weren't his.
Those were his brother's.

09:39.680 --> 09:41.613
You have no way of
knowing that.

09:41.615 --> 09:43.915
No, I didn't witness
the exchange, Agent Deakins,

09:43.917 --> 09:45.517
but I know
he's a good kid, okay?

09:45.519 --> 09:46.685
Good kid with terrible manners.

09:46.687 --> 09:47.752
I'm gonna talk to him.

09:48.455 --> 09:51.156
But listen, I think I have a more
permanent situation dialed in for him,

09:51.158 --> 09:53.758
but I just need him to stay here
for, like, another day, maybe two.

09:53.760 --> 09:54.893
And then he's gone, I promise.

09:58.030 --> 09:59.130
Okay?

09:59.132 --> 10:00.866
Mmm, you smell good.

10:01.267 --> 10:04.002
You know, I've got, like, five minutes.
We could probably...

10:04.004 --> 10:05.070
Heyo, Coach!

10:05.671 --> 10:07.506
I can go take a walk
or something

10:07.508 --> 10:09.908
if you guys are planning on making
the most of those five minutes.

10:11.143 --> 10:12.210
Sorry.

10:18.518 --> 10:20.085
So Marty Stein owns this place?

10:20.620 --> 10:21.686
It's a client of his.

10:23.155 --> 10:25.891
So maybe you'd like to tell me
what the hell is going on here?

10:26.526 --> 10:28.393
Like I said, we're laying low
for a couple of days.

10:28.995 --> 10:30.262
Don't mess with me, kid.

10:31.230 --> 10:33.532
I'm not senile yet
and I'm still your father.

10:33.534 --> 10:35.767
The guy at the store,
he was after Marty Stein.

10:36.536 --> 10:37.969
I got in the way.
That's all I can tell you.

10:39.238 --> 10:40.705
- I'll get the bags, just go ahead.
- I got it.

11:23.916 --> 11:26.117
Whatever it is you did,
you must've fucked it up.

11:26.119 --> 11:27.953
Yeah, I'll sort it out.
Don't you worry about it.

11:27.955 --> 11:29.020
Right.

11:50.576 --> 11:51.776
Hmm.

11:58.618 --> 11:59.951
Look at this, a Mauser.

12:00.252 --> 12:01.453
Must be worth a few bucks, huh?

12:01.722 --> 12:03.622
Why don't you put it back
before you hurt yourself?

12:04.256 --> 12:05.624
Well, when somebody's after me,

12:05.791 --> 12:07.993
I just soon be packin' more
than my dick.

12:07.995 --> 12:09.327
Nobody's going to find us here.

12:09.329 --> 12:10.528
Yeah, well, they're looking,
aren't they?

12:11.831 --> 12:12.998
You have nothing
to worry about.

12:13.165 --> 12:14.933
So if you hadn't busted in
at the grocery,

12:14.935 --> 12:17.135
I'd be eating foie gras
right now with your friend?

12:17.137 --> 12:18.470
For Christ's sake,
you hate liver.

12:19.106 --> 12:22.240
What I'm trying to say here is that
I could have been fucking killed

12:22.242 --> 12:23.742
over something I didn't know
anything about.

12:23.744 --> 12:25.443
Okay, look,
nobody's gonna kill you.

12:25.445 --> 12:28.580
So put the rifle away, unpack the groceries.
I'll get a fire started.

12:42.696 --> 12:43.762
Hey.

12:44.497 --> 12:45.563
Yeah, yeah, yeah. We're here.

12:46.265 --> 12:47.365
Has Howard called you yet?

12:49.669 --> 12:50.802
Yeah.

12:50.804 --> 12:52.504
Well, I guess
my first question would be,

12:52.506 --> 12:54.172
who do you know
at the Department Of Justice?

13:03.516 --> 13:05.050
He seemed serious this time.

13:05.985 --> 13:07.052
For real.

13:08.220 --> 13:10.522
I guess that leaves you
without a net.

13:10.524 --> 13:11.923
It leaves me fucked is where.

13:12.825 --> 13:13.892
Sorry.

13:14.160 --> 13:15.527
You like to get
your nails done,

13:15.529 --> 13:17.262
maybe someone
will pay you to do that.

13:17.463 --> 13:18.530
What are you saying?

13:19.799 --> 13:20.965
I can't make my own way?

13:21.734 --> 13:23.768
- I can get a job.
- Who would hire you?

13:24.336 --> 13:25.704
You have no real talents.

13:25.871 --> 13:27.739
Except making a mess
for your brother.

13:28.574 --> 13:29.641
For reals?

13:30.376 --> 13:32.610
I got no one in
my fucking corner.

13:44.890 --> 13:45.957
Hey.

13:46.392 --> 13:47.459
Double vodka.

13:48.394 --> 13:49.494
Little early, don't you think?

13:50.162 --> 13:51.529
Sure doesn't feel like it.

13:51.531 --> 13:52.597
Long day?

13:53.833 --> 13:56.401
- Why's this shit so hard, huh?
- What's that?

13:56.403 --> 13:58.503
I've been all over
the fucking city,

13:58.505 --> 14:00.805
and I cannot find
one person who'll hire me.

14:01.006 --> 14:02.073
How long have you been looking?

14:02.075 --> 14:03.608
Like three hours.

14:03.610 --> 14:06.077
Wow, and you haven't
found anything yet?

14:06.946 --> 14:09.481
Edison's ain't looking
for a hostess or nothin', huh?

14:09.882 --> 14:11.950
I can be real cordial and shit.

14:12.585 --> 14:13.651
I bet.

14:18.090 --> 14:19.457
One of my waitresses just quit.

14:19.759 --> 14:20.925
You have any experience?

14:20.927 --> 14:23.461
Yeah, I've been so
successful today.

14:24.096 --> 14:25.597
Look, if you think
you can keep up,

14:26.098 --> 14:27.365
you don't mind the shitty pay,

14:27.767 --> 14:28.867
I'm willing to give you a shot.

14:30.102 --> 14:31.936
- For real?
- Yeah, sure, why not.

14:32.972 --> 14:34.072
Just do me one favor.

14:34.074 --> 14:35.140
Anything.

14:35.442 --> 14:37.542
I don't wanna hear any more
stories about Marty Stein.

14:37.544 --> 14:39.944
I ain't talkin one more word

14:39.946 --> 14:41.613
about that
know-it-all motherfucker.

14:42.782 --> 14:43.848
All right.

14:48.454 --> 14:50.021
- You're reaching.
- So?

14:50.389 --> 14:52.290
So you're not the one that has
to sell this to a judge.

14:52.292 --> 14:55.160
God forbid you have to pull your
weight around here for once, Angela.

14:55.394 --> 14:57.295
God forbid you bring me
something I can use.

14:58.631 --> 15:00.565
Good morning around here
not that long ago.

15:01.000 --> 15:03.802
Hutchings took photos inside
the Crown building.

15:04.236 --> 15:08.106
He practically blackmailed one of Stein's
lawyers to get information on the place.

15:08.108 --> 15:09.307
What does that look like
to you?

15:09.575 --> 15:10.642
Reaching.

15:10.811 --> 15:13.645
Patty, if she says that
one more fucking time...

15:13.647 --> 15:15.246
It's an empty building, Angela,

15:15.248 --> 15:17.482
and there's almost a million
dollars in rent revenue coming in.

15:18.150 --> 15:19.784
And from that I'm supposed
to get money laundering?

15:19.786 --> 15:21.920
I've seen you get probable
cause with less.

15:22.321 --> 15:24.322
That's because
I'm a brilliant legal mind.

15:24.324 --> 15:26.558
So then, help us.

15:27.026 --> 15:28.860
- Please.
- Jesus.

15:35.000 --> 15:37.402
- Let me see that tax return again.
- Yes.

15:52.785 --> 15:54.586
Yeah. One

15:55.721 --> 15:57.689
Yay. Yeah.

16:06.131 --> 16:08.299
There we go.

16:10.636 --> 16:11.703
Look.

16:12.571 --> 16:13.638
Mmm.

16:15.407 --> 16:17.041
Mmm.

16:17.043 --> 16:19.043
This is delicious tea, baby.

16:19.045 --> 16:20.745
- Did you make that just for me?
- Yeah.

16:20.747 --> 16:21.946
Aww.

16:23.215 --> 16:25.016
Uh, run up and ask your mom
if she wants some, okay?

16:25.018 --> 16:26.084
Okay.

16:26.352 --> 16:28.219
Daddy got some business
to attend to.

16:32.191 --> 16:33.424
Marlon Dinard.

16:33.726 --> 16:35.093
What's up, Ty?

16:40.900 --> 16:42.800
- You want a drink?
- No, I'm good, man.

16:50.376 --> 16:51.743
I heard what happened to Cups.

16:52.945 --> 16:54.012
A damn shame.

16:55.915 --> 16:58.082
- Yeah, it's the course of things.
- Yeah.

16:59.752 --> 17:00.818
What you know about it?

17:02.955 --> 17:04.422
I know you ain't responsible.

17:04.790 --> 17:05.857
Good.

17:06.759 --> 17:07.825
Real good.

17:09.627 --> 17:11.628
So there won't be anything
coming back your way.

17:13.432 --> 17:14.965
I just need some assurances.

17:16.268 --> 17:17.335
You need assurances?

17:18.470 --> 17:20.471
Keep your crew out of
my territory.

17:20.873 --> 17:22.272
It's the only time
I'm gonna say it.

17:25.778 --> 17:28.947
I don't give a fuck how many
times you say it, my man.

17:31.283 --> 17:33.017
You know, Ty, this a courtesy.

17:33.319 --> 17:34.385
Well.

17:34.554 --> 17:36.821
I guess ain't no one out there
who's gonna say

17:36.823 --> 17:38.790
that Marlon Dinard ain't
no courteous motherfucker.

17:41.593 --> 17:42.660
War.

17:43.762 --> 17:46.030
War is bad for business,
that's the reality.

17:46.432 --> 17:48.366
The only reality I know
is Cups is gone.

17:49.969 --> 17:51.035
And you?

17:52.638 --> 17:55.540
You ain't been nothin' but a
figurehead for a long time, my man.

17:59.111 --> 18:00.578
It'd be a mistake
to think that.

18:01.113 --> 18:02.647
Well, it'll be
my mistake then, won't it?

18:03.916 --> 18:05.249
My breeds is hungry.

18:06.251 --> 18:08.152
I mean, it ain't like they got
a rich, white lawyer

18:08.154 --> 18:09.387
bankrolling them, right?

18:10.289 --> 18:11.489
So with all due respect,

18:12.157 --> 18:13.224
Mr. Dinard,

18:13.526 --> 18:16.094
I'm gonna let my peoples be
wherever they need to be.

18:18.764 --> 18:20.732
I already buried one friend
this week.

18:22.001 --> 18:23.735
I don't have the feeling
to make it two.

18:23.936 --> 18:25.003
Right.

18:25.138 --> 18:27.739
Right, right, right.
Let me tell you something.

18:29.541 --> 18:30.908
You handle your business,

18:32.211 --> 18:33.277
and let me handle mine.

18:34.813 --> 18:37.148
But, hey, in the meantime, if I
need a lightbulb or some shit,

18:37.150 --> 18:39.584
then, uh, I know exactly
who to call.

18:44.857 --> 18:46.424
It was real good
seeing you, Ty.

18:55.802 --> 18:56.868
What?

18:58.170 --> 19:00.238
Thought we might have
something to talk about.

19:01.073 --> 19:02.140
Hmm?

19:02.508 --> 19:03.574
Like what?

19:05.077 --> 19:08.613
Like why you're a bodyguard
when you could have been a lawyer.

19:09.481 --> 19:12.250
Well, I'm sorry, dad, you won't be
able to brag to your friends about me.

19:12.885 --> 19:13.951
Hmm.

19:15.554 --> 19:17.822
Well I hope, under the
circumstances, you're good at it.

19:18.057 --> 19:20.158
- Trust me.
- Yeah, I trust you, all right.

19:20.559 --> 19:21.659
Why wouldn't I trust you?

19:22.529 --> 19:25.797
Maybe because you've been bullshitting
me ever since you put me into your car?

19:31.070 --> 19:32.470
How long do you think
we're gonna be here?

19:33.839 --> 19:35.973
I don't know, dad.
I don't know.

19:43.082 --> 19:44.282
Maybe he likes kids.

19:44.451 --> 19:47.051
Well, obviously, he works
at a community center.

19:47.053 --> 19:49.420
No, no, I mean, like, "likes" likes.
You know, like, sexually?

19:49.422 --> 19:52.090
Please shut the fuck up and take
this seriously for a second.

19:52.092 --> 19:53.157
It's what I'm doing.

19:54.393 --> 19:56.461
I like having the kid around,
it's just, you know,

19:56.463 --> 19:58.763
some basic privacy
while I'm on the can.

19:58.765 --> 19:59.964
Oh, yeah.
Well, for Vin's sake,

19:59.966 --> 20:01.599
he'll probably want
to steer clear of that.

20:02.101 --> 20:04.035
- That's scarring shit.
- Forget it.

20:04.037 --> 20:05.103
It's like literally.

20:07.206 --> 20:08.339
Mr. Kamanski?

20:13.479 --> 20:15.379
- Can I help you?
- Yes.

20:15.381 --> 20:17.248
We have a warrant for
the financial records

20:17.250 --> 20:19.350
pertaining to
the Crown building on Douglas.

20:22.454 --> 20:23.955
Am I under arrest?

20:24.123 --> 20:25.189
Not at this time.

20:26.291 --> 20:28.526
All right, uh, I'll get
those files for you.

20:32.664 --> 20:34.799
Jesus, you'd think they'd have
a television, wouldn't you?

20:35.234 --> 20:37.535
- Want a shot?
- Yeah, break it out, yeah.

20:45.010 --> 20:46.878
You like it warm like the
Pollock's, don't you?

20:47.146 --> 20:48.246
Any way I can get it.

20:51.283 --> 20:53.017
Your mother would have
loved this, you know.

20:53.019 --> 20:55.686
What are you talking about?
She hated leaving the city.

20:55.921 --> 20:58.222
Are you kidding me?
She loved coming to the country.

21:00.459 --> 21:01.526
You didn't know her.

21:03.462 --> 21:04.529
What did you say?

21:06.765 --> 21:07.832
You heard me.

21:08.834 --> 21:10.168
You don't know shit, kid.

21:10.170 --> 21:11.235
Yeah?

21:14.973 --> 21:16.040
I'm gonna take a nap.

21:48.707 --> 21:50.875
<i>The thing is, man,</i>
<i>they hittin' us all over.</i>

21:50.877 --> 21:52.476
<i>I don't care who hittin' us.</i>

21:52.478 --> 21:54.045
- But how we supposed...
- Did I give a motherfucker permission

21:54.047 --> 21:55.179
to die on my streets?

21:55.181 --> 21:56.380
- Marlon...
- What?

21:56.382 --> 21:58.216
Say what the fuck
you wanna say, man.

21:59.551 --> 22:01.219
It open season on a King.

22:01.553 --> 22:03.588
Now we can't work if they
comin' at us like this.

22:03.590 --> 22:05.289
So step the fuck up!

22:06.425 --> 22:08.059
That's what
you're getting paid for!

22:12.564 --> 22:13.631
What's the count?

22:14.566 --> 22:15.633
I got nine.

22:15.835 --> 22:19.003
Camby and Teev at Mercy,
could slide either way.

22:27.279 --> 22:28.346
All right.

22:30.249 --> 22:32.250
- All right, pull 'em back.
- What?

22:32.618 --> 22:34.285
Take 'em off
the fucking corners, man.

22:34.586 --> 22:36.053
They ain't gonna be about
no surrender, man.

22:36.055 --> 22:37.288
This ain't about surrender.

22:38.290 --> 22:39.624
It's about street tactics.

22:44.429 --> 22:46.364
Keep it small and quiet.

22:47.399 --> 22:49.166
About to clean house.

22:49.468 --> 22:50.534
Who's up?

22:51.536 --> 22:52.670
The head of the snake.

23:04.784 --> 23:06.017
Marty. Hey.

23:07.386 --> 23:09.520
Yeah. Live to fight
another day.

23:10.122 --> 23:11.355
How we making out on your end?

23:12.624 --> 23:13.691
Uh-huh.

23:15.294 --> 23:16.627
Well, I mean you lay it out
all like that...

23:16.629 --> 23:18.696
I mean, it makes
me want to reconsider, hmm?

23:20.132 --> 23:22.800
Yeah, no, I...
I'm aware of that. It just...

23:23.602 --> 23:25.102
Yeah, there's just a lot
on the line

23:25.104 --> 23:26.904
and all I'm saying is
I'm taking a huge risk.

24:27.532 --> 24:29.400
- They're all cash.
- Same here.

24:30.569 --> 24:32.403
How did Treasury not flag
this earlier?

24:32.704 --> 24:34.271
Must have someone in the bank.

24:35.407 --> 24:36.807
Yeah, we're gonna need
another warrant.

24:37.876 --> 24:39.210
I'll go talk to Guthrie.

24:39.878 --> 24:40.945
I've got that.

24:41.413 --> 24:43.047
You rile her up.

24:43.482 --> 24:44.548
I do not.

24:53.759 --> 24:54.825
<i>Sorry, it took a second.</i>

25:04.503 --> 25:06.937
This account's only been open
two years?

25:07.506 --> 25:10.141
Well, since uh, 2007.

25:10.542 --> 25:12.810
But we only keep 24 months
here at the branch.

25:13.745 --> 25:15.346
Okay, so where's the rest?

25:15.348 --> 25:17.915
Electronically scanned
and archived at headquarters

25:17.917 --> 25:19.617
but you'll have to speak
with them about that.

25:20.285 --> 25:22.853
- Are you noticing the
common denominator here? - Uh-huh.

25:23.422 --> 25:25.489
We're going to need to speak
to this employee.

25:26.892 --> 25:28.592
Do you know
what this is, Maria?

25:28.594 --> 25:31.395
Because this seems like something
you should be familiar with.

25:31.397 --> 25:32.596
In your line of work.

25:33.098 --> 25:34.765
Maybe I'm just not very good
at my job.

25:34.767 --> 25:36.734
Oh, I sure hope that's true
because otherwise,

25:36.736 --> 25:38.335
you're in
a little bit of trouble.

25:38.737 --> 25:40.438
How long have you been
a bank cashier?

25:41.440 --> 25:42.606
I don't know.

25:42.608 --> 25:44.675
Your manager says
it's been about 15 years.

25:44.976 --> 25:46.110
Fifteen years.

25:46.878 --> 25:48.979
So given someone
with your veteran status,

25:48.981 --> 25:52.283
you'd know that any cash
deposit over $10,000,

25:52.285 --> 25:53.951
you gotta report
that to Treasury.

25:54.486 --> 25:56.387
Yeah, that's not looking
great for you, Maria.

25:56.988 --> 25:58.622
You never made
a mistake before?

25:58.624 --> 26:02.126
Yeah, but not the same mistake
for the better part of seven years.

26:02.461 --> 26:03.561
At least I'm consistent.

26:05.797 --> 26:06.864
Maria,

26:07.966 --> 26:10.167
when we get a warrant
for your bank account,

26:10.635 --> 26:12.536
are we gonna find
anything unusual?

26:13.138 --> 26:16.740
Like maybe you've been bringing in
a little extra money every month?

26:16.742 --> 26:17.842
My brother helps me out.

26:19.478 --> 26:20.544
That's sweet.

26:21.780 --> 26:22.980
So what's his number?

26:28.753 --> 26:32.189
All we want is the person
making the drop.

26:33.091 --> 26:34.558
Yeah, Maria, give us a name.

26:35.161 --> 26:39.563
And then maybe we can pretend that
you are an incompetent employee.

26:42.300 --> 26:44.001
You know, I've never been
very good with names.

26:45.103 --> 26:46.337
I just never had
the mind for it.

26:46.339 --> 26:48.005
Well, do you have
the mind for prison?

26:51.676 --> 26:54.345
- I want a lawyer.
- That's a great idea, Maria.

26:54.347 --> 26:55.846
Isn't that a great idea, Deaks?

26:55.848 --> 26:57.481
It's very reasonable,
considering.

26:57.483 --> 26:59.683
I mean, moving that kind of
money, she's looking at what?

26:59.685 --> 27:01.385
Ten, fifteen years maybe.

27:01.387 --> 27:03.621
It's all gonna depend on
how good that lawyer is.

27:04.022 --> 27:05.556
But all the money your
brother's been giving you,

27:05.558 --> 27:07.458
I'm sure you can afford some
top notch council.

27:07.460 --> 27:08.993
I sure hope so.

27:08.995 --> 27:11.328
Come on, Patty. Let's get her
some coffee while she waits.

27:11.330 --> 27:12.363
You want some coffee?

27:12.365 --> 27:13.430
Harris.

27:15.834 --> 27:17.468
I'm sorry, what?

27:18.970 --> 27:21.372
Eugene Harris is the one
who's been making the drops.

27:32.083 --> 27:33.150
Oh.

27:34.486 --> 27:37.621
Angela, get over here, you
crazy bitch, give me a hug!

27:38.390 --> 27:40.057
Deakins, I need
to speak to you.

27:40.059 --> 27:42.293
- Okay, just let me get a victory lap
in for a second. - Now, please.

27:45.230 --> 27:47.565
Uh, rain check on that hug,
Angela.

27:49.067 --> 27:51.235
We got him.
We got the motherfucker.

27:51.237 --> 27:52.436
- Who?
- Cups.

27:52.438 --> 27:54.138
Dead to rights.
The bank lady just rolled.

27:55.073 --> 27:57.908
- She named Cups?
- Not only that. She can establish a pattern.

27:58.176 --> 27:59.743
Seven years
of cash transactions.

27:59.745 --> 28:02.313
That's a criminal fucking
enterprise if I've ever seen one.

28:02.747 --> 28:04.248
I mean, we could make RICO
on this.

28:05.183 --> 28:06.317
Harper, Cups is dead.

28:10.388 --> 28:11.822
I'm sorry, what?

28:12.090 --> 28:13.791
I just got off the phone
with Chicago PD.

28:15.026 --> 28:16.327
He was shot and killed
last night.

28:40.485 --> 28:41.885
I know you, Ethan.

28:43.054 --> 28:44.855
You don't think I do, but I do.

28:45.290 --> 28:46.724
You don't know shit about me.

28:47.258 --> 28:48.859
Well, I always knew when
you were in trouble.

28:49.260 --> 28:51.362
And I know you're up
to your ass in it now.

28:51.663 --> 28:54.531
I mean, none of this stuff
is normal where I come from.

28:55.800 --> 28:57.201
What's normal anymore, dad?

28:58.837 --> 28:59.903
Hm.

29:21.593 --> 29:23.027
Oh, hey, thanks for the beer.

29:23.361 --> 29:25.262
No, no, don't bother.
I'll get it myself.

29:38.309 --> 29:40.077
This isn't about Marty Stein,
is it?

29:41.212 --> 29:42.346
No, dad.

29:42.615 --> 29:44.581
Maybe there's a deck of cards
around here somewhere.

29:54.025 --> 29:55.626
<i>Something happens,</i>
<i>you know. It's like...</i>

29:55.628 --> 29:57.127
It's like everything moves
in slow motion.

29:57.697 --> 30:00.030
You know what I'm saying?
Like real Reservoir Dogs shit.

30:00.032 --> 30:01.699
- Yeah, I got it.
- Mmm-hmm.

30:01.701 --> 30:04.201
So that's how it goes down, it's
like you don't have time to think.

30:04.536 --> 30:06.870
I heard Chyna scream.
I heard the blast of a gun go off.

30:07.172 --> 30:11.375
You know,
I'm heading in and it's like...

30:12.177 --> 30:13.477
No, no, you know what?

30:13.813 --> 30:16.346
I wasn't moving in slow motion.
Everything else was.

30:16.348 --> 30:18.549
Me, I was moving like
a fucking panther.

30:19.250 --> 30:20.417
Like a panther?

30:20.419 --> 30:21.885
And all I kept thinking
to myself was,

30:22.721 --> 30:23.887
"I gotta save Chyna."

30:24.023 --> 30:26.490
- So how many of them were in there?
- Two.

30:27.026 --> 30:29.626
It really pissed me off that the
second motherfucker got away.

30:30.195 --> 30:31.261
He f...

30:31.596 --> 30:33.597
- What, no Diet?
- No.

30:35.233 --> 30:37.668
Leo was just telling me
how many bad guys

30:37.670 --> 30:39.269
- burst into his house.
- Mmm-hmm.

30:40.238 --> 30:41.605
Yeah. It coulda been three,
or maybe four.

30:41.607 --> 30:43.006
Like I said,
it happened real quick.

30:43.341 --> 30:44.808
Thought you said
it was in slow motion.

30:45.243 --> 30:46.310
It was both.

30:46.544 --> 30:48.112
So what are you doing
with a shotgun?

30:48.680 --> 30:50.280
Thank God I had it.

30:50.282 --> 30:52.349
Could you fucking imagine where
I'd be if I didn't have it? I...

30:52.351 --> 30:54.585
I'd be bleeding out on the floor
with that scumbag that shot Chyna.

30:54.587 --> 30:56.320
You know who that scumbag was?

30:56.521 --> 30:59.656
Some misguided urban youth who
don't know the value of real work.

30:59.858 --> 31:01.625
His name was Eugene Harris.

31:02.427 --> 31:05.529
Sounds like an accountant or some
kinda fucking computer geek.

31:06.631 --> 31:07.965
He also went by Cups.

31:08.700 --> 31:09.800
What, like a tittie holder?

31:12.537 --> 31:14.671
He was the leader of
the 13th Street Kings.

31:20.612 --> 31:21.812
Are you fucking kidding me?

31:27.285 --> 31:28.952
What the fuck are they doing
shooting at me for?

31:28.954 --> 31:30.120
That's what we want to know.

31:32.891 --> 31:34.558
What, you think...
You think I'm a gangster?

31:34.560 --> 31:36.727
I ain't no fucking gangster.
Look at this face for shit's sake.

31:36.729 --> 31:40.030
- You've never had any dealings
with the 13th Street Kings? - Fuck no!

31:40.265 --> 31:42.332
- Nothing personal?
- What the fuck would I do...

31:49.908 --> 31:50.974
Fuck.

31:51.143 --> 31:53.410
- That little bitch.
- Which little bitch is that?

31:53.412 --> 31:54.545
Talia, some shit.

31:54.847 --> 31:57.147
Yeah, fuck, I banged her out
good a couple of times.

31:57.149 --> 31:58.348
You know how it is.

31:58.350 --> 31:59.616
But she got caught trying
to pass funny money

31:59.618 --> 32:00.851
and I told your people
about it.

32:01.486 --> 32:04.021
And this Talia,
she's connected to the Kings?

32:04.489 --> 32:06.390
Fuck do I know.
But her brother?

32:06.925 --> 32:08.392
Now, he's one serious
motherfucker.

32:08.660 --> 32:09.827
A name would be great.

32:11.796 --> 32:15.732
Melvin, I think.
Uh, fucking, Marvin.

32:17.202 --> 32:18.602
No, Marlon.

32:20.271 --> 32:21.772
- Marlon?
- Mmm-hmm, yeah.

32:21.774 --> 32:23.240
I remember that because
I was thinking,

32:23.776 --> 32:26.176
"I pity the fisherman that brings in
that crazy motherfucker."

32:27.846 --> 32:30.514
So are we talking Witness
Protection program here or what?

32:38.323 --> 32:41.925
Marlon is the guy
from the chandelier shop.

32:42.193 --> 32:45.062
That fool is not
a reliable witness.

32:45.064 --> 32:46.530
He doesn't know
what he's saying.

32:47.232 --> 32:50.300
- Maybe.
- It took him three tries to get that name.

32:51.536 --> 32:53.537
I'm gonna go back there,
see if I can feel it out.

32:54.038 --> 32:55.472
Fine, okay.

32:55.474 --> 32:57.374
Tomorrow morning, we'll go
together, I'll pick you up.

32:57.376 --> 32:58.942
No, no, no, I'm just gonna go
right now.

33:01.045 --> 33:02.446
You sure you don't want me to
come with?

33:02.847 --> 33:04.781
Yeah. I got it.

33:22.834 --> 33:27.337
Yeah, hi, I'm calling about a bulb
replacement for a 40-watt Freedonia.

33:28.239 --> 33:30.407
That's right, yeah.

33:34.913 --> 33:38.181
Hey, yeah, uh, I got an agent
coming your way.

33:38.917 --> 33:40.317
She's just poking around.

33:41.052 --> 33:42.686
Yeah. That's right.

33:43.855 --> 33:45.389
So look, you make sure
you tell our mutual friend

33:45.391 --> 33:47.491
about this little
courtesy call, okay?

33:49.694 --> 33:50.761
Good.

34:07.612 --> 34:08.978
Excuse me. Sorry, excuse me.

34:09.280 --> 34:10.880
Sorry, excuse me, sorry.

34:11.748 --> 34:15.819
- Hey, um, Johnny black, rocks.
- No.

34:17.155 --> 34:20.524
Sorry. Kahlua Martini.
And a Goose Island.

34:20.958 --> 34:22.059
The chicken wings?

34:22.061 --> 34:23.659
Shit, um, just one second.

34:24.629 --> 34:25.696
Sorry.

34:26.797 --> 34:27.864
Talia.

34:28.933 --> 34:30.867
Table four.
And shake that booty.

34:39.243 --> 34:40.344
Duke.

34:41.013 --> 34:45.047
I want you to know that whatever
you've got yourself mixed up in here,

34:46.016 --> 34:49.686
I've seen it before,
just history repeating itself.

34:50.455 --> 34:51.521
Let's play the game, dad.

34:51.757 --> 34:54.358
You know, you have relatives
you've never even met,

34:55.259 --> 34:56.726
who either died
too young, or...

34:57.462 --> 34:59.196
or found a way to ruin
their lives.

34:59.430 --> 35:02.065
Why do you think I moved you and
your mother out of the South Side?

35:02.333 --> 35:03.400
And look what happened.

35:03.836 --> 35:07.371
Harvard for Christ's sake,
a great soldier, a fine athlete.

35:07.373 --> 35:10.774
Nobody... nobody ever played third
base the way you did at that school.

35:12.710 --> 35:14.611
Until we lost the playoffs
because of me.

35:14.613 --> 35:16.680
Oh, for crying out loud,
you made one bad throw.

35:16.682 --> 35:17.981
It was a throw
I didn't have to make.

35:17.983 --> 35:20.450
I stepped on the bag,
dad, and it's game over.

35:20.452 --> 35:22.853
- Yeah, but we all know what
that was about, don't we? - What?

35:22.855 --> 35:24.788
That little blonde Tootsie.
What was her name?

35:24.790 --> 35:26.056
Tootsie? Do you mean Katie?

35:26.058 --> 35:28.458
Yeah, yeah, Katie.
Yes, that's what I mean.

35:28.460 --> 35:30.794
Geez. I nearly beaned her
in the stands.

35:30.796 --> 35:32.529
Yes, you did, I remember.
Yeah.

35:32.531 --> 35:34.531
Goddamn.

35:35.900 --> 35:37.234
Well, I'll take that jack.

35:40.004 --> 35:42.873
You know, maybe I wasn't
just showing off for Katie.

35:49.981 --> 35:51.982
- You hungry?
- Yeah, yeah.

35:52.250 --> 35:53.450
Where did those steaks go?

36:03.694 --> 36:04.761
Let's do this.

36:06.397 --> 36:08.498
This Ty fuck's
one upscale nigger.

36:09.567 --> 36:10.801
Fly in a bowl of milk.

36:13.271 --> 36:15.105
Let's fucking squash
the motherfucker.

38:06.884 --> 38:07.951
Good for you, Ty.

38:08.319 --> 38:10.453
Fighting till the very end.

38:33.878 --> 38:35.278
Fuck.

38:57.201 --> 38:58.568
You still take it rare, dad?

38:58.570 --> 38:59.636
Is there any other way?

39:00.272 --> 39:04.074
Buddy of mine, Cheat, he used to say
it was a sin to cook it at all.

39:04.875 --> 39:06.743
This some guy you served with?

39:07.745 --> 39:08.812
Yeah.

39:19.423 --> 39:21.324
I think this is
the rare one there.

39:21.692 --> 39:22.759
Oh, thank you.

39:33.237 --> 39:34.371
Shit, that's pretty good.

39:34.939 --> 39:36.406
Don't bullshit me.
What do you want?

39:36.408 --> 39:37.507
- A little salt.
- Yeah.

39:43.047 --> 39:44.848
- A little salt never hurt anything.
- Mmm.

39:48.953 --> 39:50.020
Oh yeah, this'll do it.

39:55.126 --> 39:56.359
Now, you see, this is normal.

39:57.328 --> 39:59.829
- No, this is fucked.
- No, this is normal.

39:59.831 --> 40:01.531
A father and son
having dinner together.

40:01.899 --> 40:04.167
Son tells his father his problems,
his father tries to help.

40:04.169 --> 40:06.202
Let's talk about what's not
normal for a second, shall we?

40:07.138 --> 40:09.205
Getting frisked every third
Saturday of the month

40:09.573 --> 40:11.741
just to talk to your dad.
That's... that's not normal.

40:12.143 --> 40:13.843
Yeah, I know that
must have been tough.

40:15.746 --> 40:16.980
It was a long time ago, pop.

40:18.749 --> 40:20.517
You know, I never stole
anything in that bank.

40:20.519 --> 40:22.919
That was Eidler and McKinnon.
They were jockeying the numbers.

40:23.254 --> 40:24.454
Is that right?

40:24.456 --> 40:26.990
I plead guilty to obstruction.
Got three years.

40:27.325 --> 40:28.925
I knew I could do it,
it wasn't that much.

40:29.760 --> 40:31.428
It is for someone who says
he didn't do it.

40:31.430 --> 40:33.730
Those guys would have gotten
10 years apiece. They were my friends.

40:35.032 --> 40:36.533
Mmm.

40:36.535 --> 40:38.301
So you chose your friends over your family.
Is that right?

40:38.303 --> 40:40.437
Well, I thought at the time
I was doing the honorable thing.

40:40.439 --> 40:41.838
Honor? Fuck honor.

40:42.673 --> 40:44.074
Honor doesn't pay the mortgage.

40:44.975 --> 40:46.609
Honor doesn't take
his kid to practice.

40:47.044 --> 40:49.713
And it sure as hell doesn't help
out with mom when she was sick.

40:50.314 --> 40:52.382
Okay. I...
I understand why you hate me.

40:54.819 --> 40:55.885
I don't hate you, dad.

40:57.388 --> 40:58.455
Well, what would you have done?

40:59.623 --> 41:01.024
I wouldn't have
abandoned my family.

41:01.026 --> 41:02.659
I didn't abandon my family!

41:02.661 --> 41:03.793
Then what would you call it?

41:06.130 --> 41:08.631
Did you know while you were
sitting in prison for three years

41:08.633 --> 41:11.468
the only time mom left the house
was to get groceries?

41:12.136 --> 41:14.204
And she'd sit in the car
and she'd send me into the store.

41:14.538 --> 41:15.605
You wanna know why?

41:15.841 --> 41:17.741
Because she was too embarrassed
to see anybody.

41:20.644 --> 41:22.412
Killed her.

41:22.414 --> 41:24.714
What? Are you saying that I'm responsible
for your mother getting cancer?

41:24.716 --> 41:26.983
No, I'm saying what you did
was fucked up.

41:27.852 --> 41:29.619
Do you have any idea
what it's like

41:30.020 --> 41:31.755
to be a 15-year-old kid

41:32.089 --> 41:34.624
and to sit there
and watch your mother die?

41:35.659 --> 41:36.760
Alone.

41:37.328 --> 41:38.395
Do you?

41:40.030 --> 41:41.164
No, no I don't.

41:41.899 --> 41:43.533
Breaks my heart that
you had to do that.

41:43.535 --> 41:44.734
Well, I'm glad that
your heart's fucking broken.

41:44.736 --> 41:46.469
You put me in that
fucking position.

41:46.871 --> 41:47.937
You.

41:49.073 --> 41:51.007
Well, you know, it cuts
both ways, Ethan.

41:51.509 --> 41:53.676
I mean, your mother wasn't
in the ground five minutes

41:53.678 --> 41:56.446
when you took off, and you didn't
even come home to say goodbye.

41:56.448 --> 41:58.615
So I think that under
the fucking circumstances,

41:58.617 --> 42:00.750
I raised you just about
as well as I could.

42:00.752 --> 42:02.619
You have no idea who
you raised!

42:06.424 --> 42:07.957
Then who the fuck are you?
Who are you?

42:07.959 --> 42:10.527
I'm a fucking killer!
I'm a fucking killer, that's who I am.

42:15.433 --> 42:17.867
And I killed American Marines.
Yeah.

42:18.702 --> 42:21.337
- Well, friendly fire happens all the time.
- It wasn't friendly fire.

42:21.872 --> 42:24.107
- No. - All right, well, somebody
fucked with you and you had...

42:24.109 --> 42:25.775
I didn't even know them, dad.

42:27.445 --> 42:28.812
I'm gonna tell you
who you raised.

42:29.313 --> 42:30.380
You raised a thief.

42:32.450 --> 42:33.683
I robbed a money train.

42:35.886 --> 42:38.188
Those Marines tried to stop me
and I killed them.

42:39.590 --> 42:41.491
And now all my friends
are dead because of it.

43:13.257 --> 43:14.357
Hi.

43:15.493 --> 43:17.627
I, uh, tried the front door,
and it was locked,

43:17.629 --> 43:19.496
and then I saw a light
in the back.

43:19.663 --> 43:21.698
- But you're busy.
- No, it's good.

43:21.966 --> 43:24.200
- Everything okay?
- Yeah, my...

43:26.504 --> 43:28.972
My boyfriend tripped over
the wire

43:28.974 --> 43:31.841
and I don't suppose you have
a warranty for stupid.

43:31.843 --> 43:34.077
It depends. How long have
you two been together?

43:36.780 --> 43:38.414
But, uh, no problem,
I'll replace it.

43:41.051 --> 43:43.353
Watch out, watch out, watch out!

43:50.795 --> 43:52.128
Hey, hey, listen.

43:52.830 --> 43:54.297
Hey, hey, hey. On my go.

43:54.299 --> 43:56.866
- I want you to empty that
whole fucking clip. - Yeah.

43:57.167 --> 43:59.202
- Come on. One, two, three.
- Okay.

43:59.537 --> 44:00.603
Go!

44:05.209 --> 44:06.943
Shit!

44:18.088 --> 44:19.455
Fuck!

44:27.498 --> 44:28.565
Yeah?

44:28.933 --> 44:32.001
It's 1483 Halstead Street.

44:32.570 --> 44:36.406
Back alley. I need backup right away.
It's a black Escalade.

44:38.709 --> 44:40.276
Yeah, send me a bus, ASAP.

44:41.245 --> 44:43.613
Okay. Let's go,
let's get you back.

44:50.554 --> 44:51.621
Slow night.

44:53.223 --> 44:54.290
You did good.

44:54.959 --> 44:56.025
It'll get easier.

44:56.694 --> 44:57.760
And if it don't?

44:57.928 --> 44:58.995
I'll fire your ass.

45:03.901 --> 45:06.936
Is that all?
You're shitting me.

45:07.538 --> 45:08.972
That's why
it's called work, sweetie.

45:13.210 --> 45:14.277
It's gonna be okay.

45:16.113 --> 45:17.847
- All right?
- Okay.

45:23.487 --> 45:24.554
Here you go.

45:36.100 --> 45:37.166
So.

45:37.968 --> 45:39.035
I'm done talking.

45:39.503 --> 45:40.570
Well, I'm not.

45:41.438 --> 45:42.705
You know those two guys
at the bank?

45:43.140 --> 45:44.207
Eidler and McKinnon?

45:45.075 --> 45:46.542
They paid me $100,000.

45:48.812 --> 45:49.912
To go to prison for them?

45:51.482 --> 45:53.049
Paid for the house
you were raised in.

45:57.655 --> 45:58.855
Aren't we the pair.

45:59.089 --> 46:01.424
So you screwed up, you know?
We all do.

46:02.192 --> 46:04.827
Somehow the world
doesn't stop spinning.

46:06.263 --> 46:07.330
Well, maybe it did for me.

46:08.332 --> 46:09.832
Only if
you keep running, kiddo.

46:24.619 --> 46:28.623
_

46:46.704 --> 46:47.726
Good afternoon.

46:47.852 --> 46:49.880
_

46:58.415 --> 47:00.083
I'd like to speak to
a US attorney please.

47:00.517 --> 47:01.584
What is it regarding?

47:02.252 --> 47:03.753
I'd like to speak to
a US attorney.

47:09.426 --> 47:11.294
So what's this all about?

47:11.862 --> 47:13.563
I'm First Lieutenant
Ethan Kelly.

47:14.064 --> 47:15.598
I killed three US Marines.
