00:50.834 --> 00:52.501

Warsaw, early August 1944

01:40.459 --> 01:44.709
DIPLOMACY

01:45.376 --> 01:47.959
<i>Europe was consumed by war.</i>

01:48.292 --> 01:50.542
<i>We were all going to die.</i>

01:51.542 --> 01:54.542
<i>After the Landings,
the Allies marched on Paris.</i>

01:55.417 --> 01:58.751
<i>The Germans planned to destroy,
to raze everything.</i>

01:59.501 --> 02:01.417
<i>Especially Paris.</i>

02:02.667 --> 02:05.042
<i>Nothing was to be left standing.</i>

02:06.292 --> 02:08.042
<i>The Fuhrers orders.</i>

03:08.792 --> 03:12.584
Paris,
the night of August 24-25, 1944

03:32.167 --> 03:33.792
Here's your coffee.

03:34.042 --> 03:36.209
You haven't slept all night again.

03:36.376 --> 03:37.251
Morning, Maryse.

03:37.417 --> 03:40.292
Tell Mayer to bring me
my uniform and boots, please.

03:40.792 --> 03:42.459
But it's 4 a.m.

03:42.626 --> 03:44.501
Do as I ask.

03:49.626 --> 03:51.001
Morning, sir.

03:51.167 --> 03:52.709
Morning, Mayer.

03:56.376 --> 03:58.709
General,
you're standing against the light.

03:59.126 --> 04:01.542
Not even a child would miss you.

04:01.709 --> 04:04.584
Children are asleep at this time.

04:05.042 --> 04:06.042
Come inside.

04:06.209 --> 04:07.209
Please.

04:09.042 --> 04:10.751
What's that, Mayer?

04:12.459 --> 04:15.251
Looks like a man
taking his dog for a walk.

04:15.667 --> 04:17.041
Such arrogance!

04:17.209 --> 04:19.500
The Parisians think we're finished.

04:49.042 --> 04:50.001
Mayer, pills!

04:50.167 --> 04:51.126
Quickly!

04:58.334 --> 05:00.292
- Should I call Dr. Fischer?
- No.

05:01.042 --> 05:03.751
Take long, deep breaths, sir.

05:13.751 --> 05:15.417
Are you ready?

05:15.584 --> 05:16.959
Yes, sir.

05:17.376 --> 05:19.376
Alfred has the car ready.

05:19.834 --> 05:21.001
But, General...

05:21.167 --> 05:23.251
It's not a favor I'm asking you,

05:23.417 --> 05:24.917
it's an order.

05:26.042 --> 05:27.959
Take that letter to my wife.

05:29.667 --> 05:32.584
Tell her
I was only doing my duty.

05:39.584 --> 05:41.709
Chocolates. For the children.

05:42.751 --> 05:44.542
General, your telegrams.

05:44.751 --> 05:45.584
Okay, fine.

05:54.542 --> 05:57.376
The enemy broke through
our defenses last night.

05:57.542 --> 05:58.376
Reinforcements?

06:01.667 --> 06:04.209
That's fine, thank you very much.

06:10.167 --> 06:10.876
Mr. Lanvin?

06:12.167 --> 06:13.334
This way, please.

06:13.792 --> 06:14.834
Why that way?

06:15.001 --> 06:16.292
The General's orders.

06:18.251 --> 06:22.626
They're near Soissons, 3 hours away.
The roads are minefields.

06:22.792 --> 06:25.542
They'll be here at noon,
if there's no more sabotage.

06:25.709 --> 06:27.584
The enemy's only <i>2</i> hours away.

06:27.751 --> 06:28.792
Gentlemen...

06:28.959 --> 06:31.751
If Paris falls, all of France falls.

06:32.042 --> 06:34.584
And the Americans march on Germany.

06:35.334 --> 06:37.709
There's no other choice left to me.

06:38.709 --> 06:41.501
The explosion will be heard in Berlin.

06:42.084 --> 06:44.709
And 50 years from now, too, I bet.

06:47.876 --> 06:48.959
Well, sir?

06:49.584 --> 06:51.292
What are you going to do?

06:51.459 --> 06:52.334
My duty.

06:55.376 --> 06:56.917
You can rely on me.

06:57.209 --> 06:58.459
I know.

06:58.917 --> 07:00.251
I have faith in you.

07:01.209 --> 07:02.126
Thank you, Mayer.

07:02.292 --> 07:04.084
But as the French say,

07:04.251 --> 07:07.584
you only die once,
but you stay dead a long time.

07:07.751 --> 07:09.709
Don't delay, get out of the city.

07:09.876 --> 07:10.834
Rest assured.

07:11.001 --> 07:12.917
I'll be in Baden-Baden tonight.

07:13.501 --> 07:15.792
Drop by Café Karl.
Eat a pretzel for me.

07:22.001 --> 07:23.084
Alfred!

07:25.042 --> 07:26.209
For the General's wife.

07:26.376 --> 07:27.626
Have a good trip.

07:30.917 --> 07:32.084
What is it?

07:33.334 --> 07:36.084
- You must leave.
- I know. Just a moment.

07:36.251 --> 07:38.334
It's pointless. The fun is over.

07:38.501 --> 07:40.292
I can't go out
without my eyes.

08:01.042 --> 08:02.417
Mr. Lanvin.

08:03.584 --> 08:04.626
Good morning.

08:07.876 --> 08:10.709
Major Ebernach
and the French engineer are here.

08:10.876 --> 08:12.876
Have them wait a moment.

08:15.751 --> 08:18.376
The General's orders are to dig in
in Paris.

08:18.542 --> 08:20.417
We'll give the enemy hell.

08:20.584 --> 08:23.959
We'll fight street by street
to the last bullet.

08:24.126 --> 08:26.501
That way, we'll hold them up a while.

08:26.667 --> 08:29.167
They won't be in Germany anytime soon.

08:32.792 --> 08:34.917
- I'll take that.
- Fine.

08:37.001 --> 08:40.583
What took 40 minutes in Kowel
will take longer in Paris,

08:40.751 --> 08:44.126
but afterwards
there won't be a stone left standing.

08:44.292 --> 08:46.876
Sorry for making you use
the backstairs.

08:47.042 --> 08:50.084
I'd rather not alarm the staff
or our troops.

08:50.251 --> 08:52.292
Suits me.
I won't boast about this.

08:52.459 --> 08:54.959
Your expertise
will be very useful to us.

08:55.126 --> 08:56.376
You know, I regret...

08:56.542 --> 08:59.126
Spare me your qualms.
I have my own.

08:59.292 --> 09:01.751
Of course,
he didn't help us voluntarily.

09:01.917 --> 09:05.917
But, as he's the expert,
I suggest he explains personally.

09:06.251 --> 09:08.584
Lanvin, you have
the General's attention.

09:11.751 --> 09:12.834
All right, then.

09:13.001 --> 09:13.834
The bridges...

09:14.584 --> 09:16.042
33 of them, in all.

09:16.209 --> 09:18.709
And a dozen more on the outskirts.

09:20.751 --> 09:23.042
All rigged with explosives.

09:24.417 --> 09:27.084
Except the Pont Neuf, right here.

09:27.542 --> 09:28.959
It's the oldest.

09:29.709 --> 09:32.542
It will allow you
to cross between both banks

09:32.709 --> 09:35.084
and to use the island
as a stronghold.

09:36.834 --> 09:40.709
Blowing up the bridges
will cause the Seine to burst its banks,

09:40.876 --> 09:42.792
like in the flood of 1910.

09:43.959 --> 09:46.542
Rubble will dam the river.

09:47.501 --> 09:50.626
All of south-eastern Paris
will soon be under water.

09:51.292 --> 09:52.709
Le Marais, first.

09:53.084 --> 09:56.626
Then, the flooding
will spread to Nation and Bastille.

09:57.751 --> 10:00.126
Probably 3-4 meters deep in places.

10:00.917 --> 10:04.292
That means no electricity,
no sewerage, nothing.

10:04.501 --> 10:06.709
Buildings and streets will collapse.

10:06.876 --> 10:09.501
We don't need explosives in this area.

10:09.667 --> 10:11.917
The Seine will do the job for us.

10:12.501 --> 10:13.959
Go on, Mr. Lanvin.

10:16.584 --> 10:18.376
Five minutes after the bridges,

10:19.834 --> 10:20.959
<i>None-Dame cathedral...</i>

10:23.376 --> 10:24.584
the Louvre...

10:26.209 --> 10:27.376
and the Opera

10:27.542 --> 10:29.167
will in turn explode.

10:30.584 --> 10:33.751
Taking the city center with them.
Nothing will be left.

10:35.667 --> 10:37.126
And the stations?

10:38.042 --> 10:39.667
Of course, the stations...

10:40.459 --> 10:44.959
Debris from Orsay Station
will help block the Seine.

10:46.709 --> 10:48.667
Likewise, the destruction

10:49.084 --> 10:52.167
of the other stations,
Austerlitz, Lyon,

10:53.292 --> 10:56.667
Gare du Nord, Gare de I'Est
and St. Lazare,

10:56.959 --> 10:58.959
will paralyze the right bank.

11:00.876 --> 11:03.459
If I'd been told
as an Architecture student

11:03.626 --> 11:06.126
that one day I'd blow up Paris...

11:07.292 --> 11:09.792
Humanity is resilient, Ebernach.

11:11.292 --> 11:13.792
Outside Sebastopol,
to prepare your attack,

11:13.959 --> 11:17.084
I had no hesitation
in blowing up the old fort.

11:19.542 --> 11:21.917
Ebernach, in Sebastopol,

11:22.084 --> 11:24.876
I had to carry out
the hardest order of my career,

11:25.042 --> 11:27.417
the liquidation
of the Jewish population.

11:27.959 --> 11:31.626
I obeyed that order
and accepted all the consequences.

11:31.834 --> 11:33.584
I know.
We dug the mass graves.

11:33.751 --> 11:35.292
And we filled them in.

11:35.876 --> 11:37.917
Today, it's Paris!

11:44.876 --> 11:48.209
Three tons of cheddite
around Place de la Concorde.

11:50.001 --> 11:52.209
Four tons in parliament

11:52.376 --> 11:54.917
and the basement of Les lnvalides.

12:07.917 --> 12:11.376
And 4 submarine torpedoes
on each leg of the Eiffel Tower.

12:16.334 --> 12:19.792
The Arc de Triomphe
will blow with Place de La Concorde

12:19.959 --> 12:22.959
to clear a line of fire
along the Champs-Elysées.

12:24.584 --> 12:26.667
That will take 20 minutes.

12:26.834 --> 12:28.334
And then, believe me,

12:28.501 --> 12:31.042
Paris will be unrecognizable.

12:31.501 --> 12:32.751
Good work.

12:32.917 --> 12:34.626
The Parisians will remember you.

12:35.709 --> 12:37.542
If there are any left.

12:37.959 --> 12:40.334
What's your estimation of casualties?

12:40.584 --> 12:42.501
It's hard to escape from hell.

12:42.667 --> 12:45.167
The current population's
around 1.5 million.

12:45.376 --> 12:48.709
That's not too bad.
Tell your men to be ready.

12:48.917 --> 12:50.167
They are.

12:52.084 --> 12:55.084
One of my platoons
is checking the time-switches.

12:55.251 --> 12:58.959
It'll take 15-20 minutes.
Then the platoon leader will call you.

12:59.417 --> 13:00.667
His name?

13:01.501 --> 13:02.792
1st Lieutenant Hegger.

13:04.084 --> 13:05.084
Where is he?

13:06.001 --> 13:08.834
I'd rather tell you that in private.

13:09.042 --> 13:10.126
Bressensdorf...

13:10.376 --> 13:13.792
Keep an eye on Mr. Lanvin.
Don't let him go anywhere.

13:13.959 --> 13:15.376
Yes, sir.

13:23.959 --> 13:24.917
Where is he?

13:25.084 --> 13:27.917
At the parliament building,
the Assemblée nationale.

13:29.251 --> 13:32.126
General, my task is complete.

13:33.584 --> 13:36.917
I request permission
to leave Paris with my unit.

13:37.334 --> 13:38.376
What?

13:40.251 --> 13:41.751
You want to go?

13:42.334 --> 13:43.876
With your permission.

13:49.417 --> 13:52.709
1st Lieutenant Hegger
will lead the operation.

13:53.459 --> 13:55.542
I've known him since Ukraine.

13:55.917 --> 13:57.792
I fully vouch for him.

14:03.876 --> 14:05.751
We are needed elsewhere.

14:28.959 --> 14:32.626
Immediately after France fell,
the Fuhrer visited Paris,

14:32.792 --> 14:36.084
to show his architect, Speer,
the city he admired most,

14:36.251 --> 14:38.876
especially the Opera,
his favorite monument.

14:39.042 --> 14:41.126
They went around it twice.

14:43.042 --> 14:44.626
So why destroy it?

14:46.126 --> 14:48.834
Hitler wanted Berlin
to be as beautiful as Paris,

14:49.001 --> 14:50.001
and bigger.

14:50.167 --> 14:53.626
Now, four years later,
Berlin is in ruins,

14:53.792 --> 14:56.626
while Paris
is as glorious as ever. See?

14:56.792 --> 14:58.626
It's unbearable for him.

14:59.917 --> 15:03.709
Even if it serves no strategic purpose,

15:04.542 --> 15:07.626
Paris must be flattened,
especially the Opera.

15:21.834 --> 15:22.876
Choltitz.

15:23.042 --> 15:24.167
Berlin?

15:24.376 --> 15:25.584
I'll hold.

15:43.751 --> 15:48.042
I was cut off.
Put me through to Berlin, will you?

15:50.376 --> 15:51.917
Morning, General.

15:55.667 --> 15:57.209
Consul?

15:58.084 --> 16:00.126
I'm not interrupting, I hope.

16:01.584 --> 16:03.501
I didn't hear you come in.

16:04.001 --> 16:05.959
To be honest, I didn't knock.

16:07.542 --> 16:08.709
May I?

16:10.584 --> 16:13.209
The stairs are pretty steep.

16:16.542 --> 16:19.417
I thought you'd left Paris.
How did you get in here?

16:19.584 --> 16:20.626
Your hotel

16:20.792 --> 16:24.292
is admirably located
in the heart of the capital but...

16:25.167 --> 16:28.834
You have no idea of its history.
Of this suite, in particular.

16:29.126 --> 16:30.917
What are you trying to say?

16:31.917 --> 16:33.834
I didn't come through the lobby.

16:34.876 --> 16:36.376
Nor through that door.

16:37.709 --> 16:40.167
I know, very rude,
and not a habit of mine.

16:40.334 --> 16:42.334
I needed to see you unseen.

16:42.501 --> 16:44.667
Explain, Mr. Nordling!
I hate riddles.

16:44.834 --> 16:47.001
In Paris, every hotel has its secrets.

16:47.209 --> 16:49.251
The Crillon, Ritz, and the Meurice.

16:49.417 --> 16:53.001
When you moved in,
you had 200 rooms to choose from.

16:53.167 --> 16:55.959
You took the only one
with a false bottom.

16:57.626 --> 16:59.001
A false bottom?

17:00.376 --> 17:03.292
Have you ever heard of Elisabeth Aryet?

17:03.459 --> 17:06.001
- Who?
- Elisabeth Aryet.

17:06.376 --> 17:08.001
And Miss Howard?

17:08.166 --> 17:11.459
Never mind.
They are one and the same person.

17:11.666 --> 17:16.459
Miss Howard was her stage name.
It's an old story but still very juicy.

17:16.834 --> 17:20.001
Around 1860, she took
numerous minor parts in plays,

17:20.209 --> 17:23.209
and some evenings,
lovers to her bed.

17:23.709 --> 17:26.876
One of her lovers
lived not very far from here,

17:27.041 --> 17:29.709
over the road in the Tuileries Palace.

17:29.876 --> 17:31.709
He was Napoleon Ill.

17:33.334 --> 17:36.667
In France, power
and affairs of the heart don't mix,

17:36.876 --> 17:38.501
especially involving an actress.

17:38.667 --> 17:42.001
But he was fond of her,
so he moved her in here.

17:42.167 --> 17:44.376
And to ensure greater discretion,

17:45.876 --> 17:47.167
he issued orders

17:47.709 --> 17:49.334
to build this staircase.

17:54.001 --> 17:55.792
A bit steep, I grant you.

17:56.001 --> 18:00.376
It leads not to the entrance
guarded by your men on Rue de Rivoli,

18:00.542 --> 18:02.042
but Rue du Mont-Thabor.

18:02.917 --> 18:05.834
The Emperor
merely had to cross the Tuileries,

18:06.709 --> 18:08.667
walk up the stairs

18:10.042 --> 18:11.792
and into the arms of...

18:12.667 --> 18:14.751
Miss Howard.

18:17.126 --> 18:19.751
France was none the worse for it.

18:35.126 --> 18:36.292
Hans!

18:37.084 --> 18:40.001
You two,
go down to Rue du Mont-Thabor.

18:40.167 --> 18:42.417
- What number?
- There is no number.

18:42.584 --> 18:43.209
Where is it?

18:43.376 --> 18:46.751
Is this necessary?
I doubt Napoleon Ill will drop in.

18:46.917 --> 18:48.459
Where is it?

18:50.751 --> 18:54.167
The steel door
on the corner of Rue de Castiglione.

18:54.334 --> 18:55.834
The corner of Rue de Castiglione.

18:56.001 --> 18:57.417
You, follow me.

19:00.917 --> 19:03.459
Check this staircase is secure.

19:10.042 --> 19:12.626
There are 2-3,000 terrorists out there,

19:13.126 --> 19:15.376
who'd happily spit on my corpse.

19:17.876 --> 19:20.126
Did I not release
all political prisoners?

19:20.834 --> 19:22.542
The last were freed yesterday.

19:22.709 --> 19:23.334
So, what now?

19:28.834 --> 19:31.542
I came to suggest
you put an end to all this.

19:31.709 --> 19:34.001
Your so-called terrorists are patriots.

19:34.167 --> 19:35.959
I respect enemy combatants,

19:36.126 --> 19:38.334
but they are Bolshevik criminals,

19:38.501 --> 19:41.251
and I will crush
every last one of them!

19:41.417 --> 19:44.167
Kill one
and you create two more.

19:44.334 --> 19:46.917
That depends
on the resources we deploy.

19:47.417 --> 19:50.834
I was sent to Paris to restore order.
I shall do much more.

19:51.001 --> 19:52.792
What will you do exactly?

19:56.792 --> 20:00.084
Nothing special.
The stairs lead down to the street.

20:00.667 --> 20:03.834
I was cut off.
It's urgent, take care of it.

20:10.042 --> 20:12.792
- What's going on?
- No time.

20:14.709 --> 20:17.626
Choltitz isn't finished yet.
If you saw him at Kharkov...

20:17.792 --> 20:19.042
I was there.

20:19.209 --> 20:20.001
You too?

20:20.251 --> 20:22.626
To think that barely two weeks ago,

20:22.792 --> 20:27.667
Paris was the dream posting
for a German soldier.

20:29.917 --> 20:34.876
The most docile, disciplined territory
in the whole of Nazi Europe.

20:36.917 --> 20:40.834
An officer posted here
knew he had left the war behind

20:41.001 --> 20:42.667
and would want for nothing.

20:43.501 --> 20:46.792
The only battles to be fought here

20:47.334 --> 20:50.709
were to obtain the best table
in a restaurant.

20:55.334 --> 20:58.084
The Parisians are cowards,
Mr. Nordling.

20:59.751 --> 21:02.542
They skulked
in their homes for four years.

21:05.126 --> 21:07.959
The enemy's Normandy landings
brought some out,

21:08.126 --> 21:11.084
and now they start to attack us,
to defy us,

21:11.417 --> 21:13.584
killing dozens of my men.

21:14.626 --> 21:16.126
I shall make them pay.

21:17.542 --> 21:21.167
With no distinction
between terrorists and the others.

21:24.084 --> 21:28.709
I advise you to leave the city
forthwith. It's not your war.

21:30.001 --> 21:32.751
Leave Paris no less?
And go where?

21:33.584 --> 21:36.292
I have no idea.
Back home, I suppose.

21:36.917 --> 21:38.376
Back home?

21:38.876 --> 21:40.501
This is my home.

21:42.126 --> 21:43.876
You can't say the same.

21:44.042 --> 21:45.209
Pardon me?

21:45.834 --> 21:48.167
We're foreigners.
I'm Swedish, you're German,

21:48.334 --> 21:51.042
but I was born
and lived all my life in Paris.

21:51.792 --> 21:54.084
You've been here barely two weeks.

21:54.376 --> 21:55.501
So what?

21:57.417 --> 22:00.751
I know these men and women.
They won't leave you in peace.

22:01.376 --> 22:04.376
They've sacrificed their jobs,
comfort and families.

22:04.542 --> 22:06.334
They'll die for their cause.

22:06.542 --> 22:10.376
Same here, Mr. Nordling.
This is war, not a pleasure cruise.

22:10.542 --> 22:12.459
Indeed. But you have 2,000 men.

22:12.626 --> 22:14.834
And on the other side? 3 million.

22:15.001 --> 22:18.167
One day very soon,
they'll make short work of you.

22:18.334 --> 22:20.042
Who? The French?

22:20.334 --> 22:21.751
Short work of us?

22:23.042 --> 22:24.501
You claim to know them?

22:24.917 --> 22:27.209
You're a diplomat, I'm a soldier.

22:27.376 --> 22:29.084
Spare me your advice.

22:30.792 --> 22:33.876
3 million civilians, what's that?
Nothing!

22:34.667 --> 22:36.084
It's bluster!

22:36.376 --> 22:38.709
I'll swat them aside like flies.

22:43.626 --> 22:48.501
Governor, two armored divisions
strike for Paris, as we speak.

22:49.334 --> 22:53.084
Two Allied divisions. We both know it.
You must face facts.

22:53.251 --> 22:56.959
Two divisions, that's 30-40,000 soldiers
you cannot hope to beat,

22:57.126 --> 23:01.209
who will enter the city shortly
to fight alongside its population.

23:01.376 --> 23:02.792
What will you do then?

23:03.251 --> 23:07.126
You think the enemy
is alone on the road to Paris?

23:08.292 --> 23:10.542
Fear not, reinforcements are coming.

23:10.709 --> 23:13.126
Four SS Panzer divisions

23:13.292 --> 23:15.584
left Denmark six days ago.

23:15.751 --> 23:20.209
You mean the 4 divisions
stuck since yesterday near Soissons?

23:23.376 --> 23:25.584
Surely not.
You're expecting others.

23:25.792 --> 23:28.417
My time is precious.
Come to the point.

23:30.292 --> 23:31.667
As you wish.

23:33.292 --> 23:36.334
My embassy was contacted last night
by the French general

23:36.501 --> 23:39.626
whose divisions are headed your way.

23:41.042 --> 23:43.584
He told me, or rather asked me,

23:44.751 --> 23:47.001
to give you this letter.

23:50.126 --> 23:52.876
A letter? From a French general?

23:53.667 --> 23:55.042
Interesting.

23:55.834 --> 23:57.709
You know this general, then.

23:58.584 --> 24:00.542
I've heard of him. Everybody has.

24:00.709 --> 24:03.292
- You've never met him?
- Not yet.

24:03.709 --> 24:05.542
So, why your embassy?

24:05.709 --> 24:07.084
I suppose he was told

24:07.251 --> 24:09.876
that we'd met frequently
in the last few days,

24:10.042 --> 24:13.542
that I'd been the go-between
for the political prisoners,

24:13.959 --> 24:16.751
and that we are on good terms,
you and I.

24:17.542 --> 24:19.042
On good terms?

24:22.334 --> 24:23.876
We are, aren't we?

24:24.501 --> 24:26.167
Perhaps he simply thought

24:26.334 --> 24:29.917
that representing a neutral nation
would make my task easier.

24:30.667 --> 24:33.542
That's why you're here?
To deliver that letter?

24:37.959 --> 24:40.209
Who are you working for, Mr. Nordling?

24:42.542 --> 24:44.042
I beg your pardon?

24:45.959 --> 24:48.126
Who are you working for?

24:50.542 --> 24:53.834
A general you hardly know
wakes you one night,

24:54.001 --> 24:55.292
and you come running?

24:55.459 --> 24:58.334
If I can help create a climate...

24:58.626 --> 25:00.042
Naturally.

25:01.292 --> 25:02.876
Well, give me the letter.

25:08.459 --> 25:10.417
I am not in the habit

25:10.584 --> 25:14.209
of corresponding with an enemy general

25:15.042 --> 25:17.251
before hostilities have ended.

25:18.126 --> 25:19.751
You can take that back.

25:21.584 --> 25:23.584
That's exactly what I told him.

25:24.292 --> 25:28.126
If I were you, I'd have read it first,
if only out of curiosity.

25:28.292 --> 25:29.126
Pointless.

25:29.292 --> 25:33.209
Tell this jester
I do not accept ultimatums.

25:33.501 --> 25:36.251
It is exactly that. You're very sharp.

25:36.959 --> 25:40.042
No, it's simply usual practice
in the circumstances.

25:40.209 --> 25:42.459
It's usual practice? I'd no idea.

25:43.251 --> 25:46.417
And your duty is to reject it?
That's usual practice?

25:46.584 --> 25:49.126
No, I have my orders,
and I never question an order.

25:49.292 --> 25:50.334
Of course.

25:50.501 --> 25:52.709
Otherwise, you wouldn't be a general.

25:55.584 --> 25:57.959
What if an order is absurd?

25:58.126 --> 26:00.542
I have never received such an order.

26:03.459 --> 26:04.542
Never?

26:06.626 --> 26:07.709
Never.

26:10.459 --> 26:12.917
You can't defend Paris with 2,000 men.

26:13.084 --> 26:14.917
It's impossible, as you know.

26:15.084 --> 26:19.417
General Leclerc guarantees
honorable surrender for you and Germany,

26:19.584 --> 26:21.042
with only two conditions.

26:21.209 --> 26:23.126
One, you surrender without a fight.

26:23.292 --> 26:25.292
Two, you return Paris as you found it.

26:25.459 --> 26:27.792
In other words, intact. That's all.

26:29.626 --> 26:31.084
Think about it, General.

26:33.167 --> 26:35.042
Have you finished, Consul?

26:36.084 --> 26:37.376
I beg your pardon?

26:39.667 --> 26:40.709
Hans!

26:42.709 --> 26:43.959
Get me Bressensdorf.

26:45.501 --> 26:47.167
I'd ask you to leave now.

26:48.126 --> 26:50.292
Don't argue. Leave!

27:03.292 --> 27:05.001
What do I tell General Leclerc?

27:05.167 --> 27:07.751
Tell him he'll remember today.

27:08.709 --> 27:12.251
Ensure Mr. Nordling
reaches his embassy safely.

27:12.667 --> 27:14.084
Yes, sir.

27:16.001 --> 27:16.834
Choltitz.

27:18.126 --> 27:19.584
What is it, Lieutenant?

27:21.417 --> 27:22.376
What?

27:26.001 --> 27:27.209
Hold on.

27:27.626 --> 27:29.709
I asked you to leave, Mr. Nordling.

27:29.959 --> 27:30.917
Follow me.

27:31.084 --> 27:34.084
That's Lt. Hegger, I suppose.

27:34.876 --> 27:35.834
Pardon me?

27:36.126 --> 27:38.959
I fear he doesn't have
good news for you.

27:40.001 --> 27:42.751
Here, I'll leave you this, just in case.

27:43.834 --> 27:47.584
It's a copy of the letter you ripped up.

27:53.167 --> 27:54.876
Wait, Bressensdorf.

27:57.876 --> 27:59.292
Yes, Lieutenant, go ahead.

27:59.542 --> 28:02.209
The detonator mechanisms
have been sabotaged.

28:02.834 --> 28:03.459
Sorry?

28:03.626 --> 28:04.584
<i>How much damage?</i>

28:04.751 --> 28:06.167
I can't say yet.

28:07.126 --> 28:08.834
Out, Bressensdorf!

28:09.417 --> 28:11.501
Consul Nordling stays with me.

28:12.709 --> 28:14.042
Very good, sir.

28:16.626 --> 28:18.167
How much time do you need?

28:20.709 --> 28:24.251
Do what it takes.
You have ten minutes.

28:24.417 --> 28:25.834
<i>Not a second longer.</i>

28:26.126 --> 28:28.001
What about the Resistance men?

28:29.626 --> 28:31.001
Yes, sir.

28:33.126 --> 28:34.876
I'll keep you informed.

28:39.376 --> 28:40.084
Load.

28:41.376 --> 28:42.751
Take aim.

28:43.042 --> 28:43.584
Fire!

28:54.542 --> 28:59.001
It appears I was letting you go
too soon, Consul.

29:03.251 --> 29:05.584
There was more. How did you know?

29:06.292 --> 29:07.084
Pardon me?

29:07.251 --> 29:09.126
That Lt. Hegger would call.

29:12.251 --> 29:15.501
I'm a diplomat.
I love listening at doors.

29:16.084 --> 29:18.542
By the way, Café Karl ran out of...

29:19.709 --> 29:22.501
pretzels long ago, you know.

29:23.292 --> 29:24.292
Rationing.

29:25.292 --> 29:27.209
Corporal Mayer won't be happy.

29:27.376 --> 29:29.084
How long were you at that door?

29:29.251 --> 29:32.959
Impressive, these chess pieces.
They add a dimension to your map.

29:33.126 --> 29:35.834
Look at me when I talk to you.

29:36.834 --> 29:39.667
What do you know?
Who tipped off the terrorists?

29:41.042 --> 29:42.209
What terrorists?

29:42.626 --> 29:46.334
Don't play dumb now.
Lt. Hegger's work was sabotaged.

29:46.792 --> 29:49.626
How unfortunate. I haven't a clue.

29:49.959 --> 29:52.209
How did you know he'd be delayed?

29:52.959 --> 29:57.334
His unit's location was known
only to myself and Ebernach.

29:59.001 --> 30:00.126
I had no idea.

30:00.292 --> 30:02.667
I'd advise you to stop this.

30:03.001 --> 30:05.501
In your own best interest, answer me.

30:05.709 --> 30:07.501
I thought I was answering you.

30:08.376 --> 30:10.876
How long have you spied on me
for France?

30:12.334 --> 30:14.167
I don't work for France.

30:14.751 --> 30:16.709
Who then? Britain? America?

30:16.876 --> 30:19.167
You accord me too much importance.

30:19.334 --> 30:21.667
My initiative is strictly personal.

30:21.834 --> 30:23.084
You think I'm stupid?

30:25.584 --> 30:28.084
If I may, I'd rather not answer that.

30:28.251 --> 30:31.126
Turn around. I haven't finished.

30:31.292 --> 30:34.209
Just a moment,
while I bring this up to date.

30:35.834 --> 30:37.834
Stand clear of that map!

30:40.126 --> 30:42.292
I'll tell you what happened.

30:43.376 --> 30:46.834
You did come up those stairs,
but not alone.

30:47.001 --> 30:49.126
You had an accomplice,

30:50.167 --> 30:51.709
one of the terrorists.

30:53.084 --> 30:55.709
You both hid behind the door,

30:55.876 --> 30:59.167
until you had
the information you came for.

31:01.167 --> 31:03.209
Then, the other man

31:03.501 --> 31:05.501
went to inform your friends.

31:12.667 --> 31:17.126
And you entered
in order to buy some time.

31:18.292 --> 31:20.626
You knew
I wouldn't be easily dissuaded,

31:20.792 --> 31:24.042
that a minor French general's letter

31:24.209 --> 31:25.959
wouldn't change my mind.

31:27.084 --> 31:29.334
Unless my operation was sabotaged,

31:29.501 --> 31:32.626
leaving me no alternative
but to negotiate.

31:34.834 --> 31:36.751
Well? Is that it?

31:37.667 --> 31:38.917
Admit it.

31:42.209 --> 31:45.709
Do you know
what we do to men like you?

31:48.042 --> 31:49.376
Give them a medal?

31:50.876 --> 31:53.084
Yes, on occasion.

31:54.292 --> 31:56.084
Posthumously.

31:59.584 --> 32:02.709
You forget one thing, Governor.

32:02.917 --> 32:04.626
One small detail.

32:04.792 --> 32:07.459
Supposing I were
in collusion with the Resistance,

32:07.626 --> 32:10.792
and with my knowledge
of the staircase's existence,

32:11.001 --> 32:14.042
do you think
you would still be alive?

32:16.876 --> 32:20.501
In two weeks,
if I'd wanted to bring in armed men,

32:20.667 --> 32:23.084
I'd have had no lack of opportunity.

32:23.417 --> 32:25.126
Especially, tonight.

32:34.792 --> 32:37.959
Sweden is a neutral country, Governor.

32:39.459 --> 32:41.917
It has maintained its neutrality

32:42.084 --> 32:43.959
throughout two world wars.

32:45.292 --> 32:48.584
I have no wish
to change that state of affairs.

33:00.459 --> 33:02.751
In that case,
what are you doing here?

33:06.626 --> 33:08.626
I came here for that.

33:09.584 --> 33:11.959
So your children
see that, too, one day.

33:12.167 --> 33:13.834
Dawn over Paris.

33:14.542 --> 33:16.626
- Stand back from the balcony.
- Sorry?

33:16.792 --> 33:18.334
You could signal to your men.

33:18.751 --> 33:20.417
- Please!
- Stand back.

33:20.959 --> 33:22.292
How can I prove to you...

33:22.459 --> 33:24.126
Don't argue. Stand back!

33:36.834 --> 33:38.584
How old are your children?

33:38.751 --> 33:40.876
Leave my children out of this.

33:41.584 --> 33:44.834
You can answer
without fear of betraying a secret.

33:45.876 --> 33:49.584
My girls are 14 and 8,
and my boy's 4 months old.

33:49.751 --> 33:51.292
Four months?

33:51.626 --> 33:53.084
Congratulations!

33:53.501 --> 33:55.876
When I was 8,
like your younger daughter,

33:56.042 --> 33:59.042
I often wondered
how a name as simple as Paris

33:59.209 --> 34:03.251
could represent all the things
visible from your balcony.

34:04.626 --> 34:07.584
All these streets, houses, plazas...

34:07.751 --> 34:09.792
All the squares, too.

34:10.501 --> 34:15.876
I couldn't see how so many things
and so many people

34:16.042 --> 34:20.376
could fit in a city
whose name was so short.

34:25.876 --> 34:28.833
Why do you insist
on destroying the city?

34:29.751 --> 34:32.458
It's none of your business.

34:32.626 --> 34:35.417
Wrong.
If I hadn't been asked to contact you,

34:35.583 --> 34:39.833
I'd be asleep, oblivious,
like all these people you'll soon kill.

34:40.001 --> 34:42.792
Can you stop your histrionics?

34:42.958 --> 34:45.708
They are civilians,
caught up in an absurd war,

34:45.876 --> 34:48.542
innocent of any action against you.

34:51.833 --> 34:55.001
What does a life mean to you?
What is a life?

34:55.833 --> 34:59.459
Of those about to perish,
how many children like yours?

34:59.626 --> 35:00.667
Be quiet!

35:07.751 --> 35:11.917
You sneak in like a thief
and lecture me in morality?

35:14.584 --> 35:18.084
Allow me to remind you of something.

35:18.251 --> 35:22.542
One year ago, from July-August '43,
to be precise,

35:23.042 --> 35:28.209
your friends dropped
over 10,000 tons of bombs on Hamburg.

35:28.376 --> 35:29.542
10,000 tons!

35:31.126 --> 35:34.626
Most were phosphorus bombs.
You know what that means?

35:34.792 --> 35:36.917
Anybody who wasn't shredded
or incinerated

35:37.084 --> 35:40.501
died of suffocation
with their throat and lungs on fire.

35:40.667 --> 35:44.084
They were civilians.
Women, children, old folks.

35:44.292 --> 35:47.292
None of them had fought in battle.

35:48.667 --> 35:50.917
How curious that you never protest

35:51.084 --> 35:54.042
when the civilians being killed
are ours?

35:55.542 --> 35:57.334
You are misinformed, General.

35:57.501 --> 36:01.376
My embassy and I have always
denounced such actions from all sides.

36:03.834 --> 36:07.626
Not with the ardor you display today.
Definitely not!

36:09.667 --> 36:12.042
By that logic,
the Allies destroying a city

36:12.209 --> 36:15.334
gives you the right to destroy one, too.
Correct?

36:16.917 --> 36:20.751
Unless, of course,
you are merely looking for excuses.

36:21.709 --> 36:23.376
Excuses?

36:24.417 --> 36:26.959
I won't believe
you have no misgivings?

36:27.126 --> 36:29.542
Believe what you want, Mr. Nordling.

36:30.251 --> 36:32.167
My conscience is clear.

36:33.459 --> 36:37.501
Paris will suffer the same fate
as Mannheim, Hamburg and Berlin.

36:37.917 --> 36:40.084
We'll all have our martyrs.

36:40.251 --> 36:41.334
Now you know.

36:41.959 --> 36:43.334
It makes you a criminal.

36:43.501 --> 36:45.501
- A criminal?
- Absolutely.

36:45.667 --> 36:47.626
The pilots who bombed Hamburg,

36:47.792 --> 36:49.709
we'll never know their names.

36:49.876 --> 36:51.626
But you give the orders.

36:51.792 --> 36:54.459
You'll be remembered
as the man who destroyed Paris.

36:54.626 --> 36:57.417
How does that make me a criminal?

36:57.584 --> 37:02.167
The annihilation of a city
outside a combat zone is a criminal act.

37:02.334 --> 37:04.334
Yes, we agree there.

37:05.126 --> 37:08.292
Paris, as far as I know,
is not in any combat zone.

37:08.459 --> 37:09.709
That's correct.

37:09.876 --> 37:11.917
Or it was, until last night.

37:12.376 --> 37:14.417
At 03:10 exactly,

37:14.584 --> 37:18.459
your general
breached our outer line of defense.

37:18.751 --> 37:22.126
By attacking our bases,
he broke his city's neutrality.

37:22.292 --> 37:24.376
He is a direct threat to it.

37:24.542 --> 37:28.167
As Governor of Paris,
I am sole in charge of our response.

37:29.376 --> 37:33.251
You see a crime, Consul?
I see only an act of war.

37:34.542 --> 37:37.334
The Allied advance
allows you to raze the city?

37:37.501 --> 37:41.292
It's clearly the best riposte
I can give them.

37:41.959 --> 37:45.501
With no concern for relations
between France and Germany?

37:45.667 --> 37:47.209
What relations?

37:47.834 --> 37:50.334
The bond between neighboring peoples.

37:50.501 --> 37:53.001
Don't delude yourself.
By destroying Paris,

37:53.167 --> 37:56.251
you demolish
any future bilateral relationship.

37:56.417 --> 37:58.459
We're not at that stage yet.

37:58.626 --> 37:59.959
Of course we are.

38:00.334 --> 38:02.792
It's your duty to consider the future.

38:02.959 --> 38:03.834
My duty?

38:04.001 --> 38:05.584
As a German and human being.

38:05.751 --> 38:07.334
You're quite wrong!

38:07.834 --> 38:11.417
My duty is to lead my men to victory,
by all means possible.

38:11.584 --> 38:14.376
Everything else
is absolutely irrelevant.

38:15.001 --> 38:18.751
Frankly, I don't understand you.
You can't let this happen.

38:18.917 --> 38:20.709
Paris doesn't belong to you.

38:20.876 --> 38:24.084
When will you stop
seeing Paris as a French city?

38:26.542 --> 38:28.626
If the Parisians had defended it,

38:28.834 --> 38:30.626
or even burned it!

38:31.626 --> 38:35.292
As the Russians burned Moscow
to stop Napoleon. But no!

38:36.292 --> 38:40.042
They gave it to us,
legs wide open, like a whore.

38:42.209 --> 38:46.126
The city is ours.
We do with it as we please.

38:46.501 --> 38:48.292
Paris belongs to no one.

38:48.709 --> 38:52.251
Are you here as Swedish consul
or mayor of the city?

38:52.417 --> 38:55.584
Neither.
Tonight, I am simply Raoul Nordling.

38:55.876 --> 38:57.084
Fine.

38:58.001 --> 39:01.751
Now listen to me very carefully,
Mr. Raoul Nordling.

39:02.501 --> 39:04.584
I'll be very clear with you.

39:05.959 --> 39:08.042
You won't make me change my mind.

39:09.959 --> 39:13.001
I have received orders,
I will obey them.

39:13.167 --> 39:15.834
- At the cost of thousands of lives?
- Absolutely.

39:16.001 --> 39:18.292
- And an irreplaceable city?
- Yes.

39:20.459 --> 39:22.376
Meanwhile, I'll keep you here.

39:22.542 --> 39:26.542
Then, I advise you to leave this city
as fast as possible.

39:26.709 --> 39:29.209
There. I have nothing more to say.

39:55.167 --> 39:56.792
I was wrong.

39:58.751 --> 40:01.584
I was wrong about you, General.
And about myself.

40:02.209 --> 40:07.251
I was sure I could dissuade you
from doing something so crazy but...

40:09.292 --> 40:13.001
I clearly overestimated my capabilities.

40:20.167 --> 40:22.959
So, we'll never see that dome again.

40:26.042 --> 40:29.417
No more Louvre,
no more Place de la Concorde.

40:32.209 --> 40:35.084
No more children playing in the parks.

40:35.959 --> 40:38.209
No more towers of Notre-Dame.

40:39.917 --> 40:42.709
Everything must go. Forever.

40:46.292 --> 40:49.209
And you have no remorse?

40:49.376 --> 40:50.376
No.

40:52.917 --> 40:54.792
What kind of man are you?

40:55.751 --> 40:59.042
All for what?
You know destroying Paris is pointless.

40:59.209 --> 41:01.876
It's gratuitous. Purely gratuitous.

41:02.792 --> 41:05.542
Germany has lost the war.
You've lost too.

41:05.709 --> 41:07.959
What are you talking about now?

41:08.126 --> 41:11.917
Don't pretend otherwise.
You fought in Russia, Italy, Normandy...

41:12.084 --> 41:15.334
You're looking down the barrel.
On all fronts.

41:16.626 --> 41:20.417
Sooner or later, the Allies
will reach Germany and then what?

41:20.584 --> 41:24.084
The Red Army is in Poland,
headed for Romania and Hungary.

41:24.251 --> 41:25.501
You'll be surrounded

41:25.751 --> 41:27.792
and it will be all over.

41:28.251 --> 41:30.501
Look out there,
look at the city,

41:31.501 --> 41:33.751
and tell me if it's worth it.

41:34.084 --> 41:35.834
It's out of the question.

41:36.626 --> 41:38.876
You'd rather not look
reality in the eye?

41:39.084 --> 41:41.876
Whose reality? Yours or mine?

41:42.042 --> 41:45.001
The reality
that destroying Paris is absurd.

41:45.167 --> 41:45.834
Yours then.

41:46.001 --> 41:48.542
Not mine alone.
The world is watching you.

41:48.751 --> 41:51.584
In the end, you,
General Dietrich von Choltitz,

41:51.751 --> 41:53.584
will be held responsible.

41:53.751 --> 41:54.667
All for what?

41:54.834 --> 41:58.459
To delay the Allied attack on Germany
for a few weeks?

41:58.626 --> 42:00.167
It makes no sense.

42:03.626 --> 42:07.917
I understand that you have your orders
and must obey them.

42:08.376 --> 42:12.251
But surely, at some point,
obedience ceases to be a duty.

42:15.542 --> 42:17.334
In your whole career,

42:17.501 --> 42:20.251
have you never had a doubt or even...

42:22.251 --> 42:23.334
a hesitation

42:23.667 --> 42:25.626
over the legality of an order?

42:25.792 --> 42:27.584
Even if that were the case,

42:27.751 --> 42:30.542
I have no right to incite uncertainty
among my men

42:30.709 --> 42:32.792
through my own insubordination.

42:33.876 --> 42:37.584
A general at the front
must be a model for his troops.

42:43.001 --> 42:43.792
Hans...

42:45.251 --> 42:47.084
Wire this to HQ.

42:49.001 --> 42:51.167
What about my call to Berlin?

42:55.167 --> 42:58.084
The blast should blow the bridge away,

42:58.251 --> 42:59.459
like a cyclone.

43:00.167 --> 43:03.751
As it's steel,
we need to add 30 kg of explosives.

43:03.917 --> 43:07.459
Right there and there,
where they intersect, okay?

43:09.042 --> 43:11.542
- Is the damage fixed?
- Changed and checked.

43:11.709 --> 43:13.001
Line, please!

43:14.209 --> 43:15.834
Communications still down.

43:16.584 --> 43:17.376
Shit!

43:18.084 --> 43:19.834
I'll try from the roof.

43:33.167 --> 43:36.001
You remind me of Abraham.

43:36.209 --> 43:37.334
Who?

43:38.084 --> 43:39.834
Abraham, in the bible.

43:40.001 --> 43:43.126
When God orders him to kill his son,
Abraham obeys.

43:43.292 --> 43:45.626
He sharpens his knife,
builds an altar,

43:45.792 --> 43:47.751
raises his arm to stab Isaac,

43:47.917 --> 43:50.959
never expecting
God to intervene at the last.

43:52.209 --> 43:54.209
How can one justify doing that?

43:54.376 --> 43:57.709
By claiming he was doing God's will
or feared His wrath?

43:57.876 --> 44:00.459
But that misses the point, which is,

44:00.626 --> 44:03.709
what child
would want a father like that?

44:04.917 --> 44:08.626
If not for its beauty or people,
save Paris for you, your soldiers

44:08.792 --> 44:09.709
and Germany!

44:10.126 --> 44:10.834
For Germany?

44:11.001 --> 44:12.501
Believe me,

44:12.876 --> 44:16.167
if you destroy Paris,
it will be a disaster for Germany.

44:17.667 --> 44:21.167
The repercussions of such a crime
go beyond the war.

44:21.334 --> 44:23.917
Germany will be made an outcast.

44:24.334 --> 44:26.292
Your children

44:27.542 --> 44:31.334
and those of the survivors
will wear the swastika in their flesh.

44:31.501 --> 44:34.667
Just as others
currently wear yellow stars.

44:38.126 --> 44:40.876
You certainly are a fine talker.

44:42.209 --> 44:43.709
Abraham...

44:44.959 --> 44:46.084
A Jew.

44:47.917 --> 44:49.917
It's an interesting analogy.

44:53.334 --> 44:57.376
I no longer believe in God,
but I remember the bible well.

44:59.001 --> 45:01.084
In fact, you're asking me

45:01.251 --> 45:05.292
to betray the oath I took
to serve my country.

45:05.626 --> 45:09.042
You're asking me
to betray my whole upbringing.

45:09.876 --> 45:13.376
My father was a soldier.
My grandfather was also a soldier.

45:13.542 --> 45:16.751
My ancestors fought Napoleon
in his Russian campaign.

45:16.917 --> 45:19.001
And I have been in two wars.

45:19.584 --> 45:21.251
Let me finish.

45:22.167 --> 45:24.459
I saw everything in those wars.

45:25.667 --> 45:30.084
The intoxication of victory
and the humiliation of defeat.

45:30.542 --> 45:34.251
I, too, want this one to end,
the sooner the better.

45:34.417 --> 45:36.709
But I will never capitulate.

45:37.876 --> 45:40.751
If Hitler told you
to kill your little boy,

45:40.917 --> 45:42.334
you wouldn't hesitate?

45:42.501 --> 45:44.334
Like Abraham, 4,000 years ago?

45:44.501 --> 45:46.251
You're becoming insolent.

45:47.126 --> 45:49.626
You hardly leave me any choice.

46:08.167 --> 46:10.751
- We're here to see the General.
- Follow me.

46:15.209 --> 46:17.667
We bring a message
from Heinrich Himmler.

46:17.834 --> 46:20.751
Very well. I'll inform the General.

46:23.667 --> 46:24.542
Where's the...

46:25.167 --> 46:26.459
Kitchen? Eat?

46:26.667 --> 46:28.292
Nothing left, can't help you.

46:28.459 --> 46:29.709
Show us anyway.

46:29.959 --> 46:31.376
Your boys, all gone.

46:31.542 --> 46:32.376
Show me!

46:33.251 --> 46:34.709
What's the plonk?

46:35.417 --> 46:37.667
It's the last bottle we have. Cider.

46:37.834 --> 46:38.792
Open it up!

46:39.334 --> 46:40.792
It's from Normandy.

46:41.334 --> 46:43.251
Get it open, I said!

46:44.334 --> 46:45.459
Give it here.

46:51.292 --> 46:52.001
Gentlemen.

46:52.167 --> 46:53.292
We've come from Berlin.

46:54.251 --> 46:55.959
Crossed through the lines.

46:56.667 --> 46:58.209
An absolute miracle!

46:58.376 --> 47:00.584
On an important mission
from Himmler.

47:02.126 --> 47:03.626
Concerning?

47:03.792 --> 47:05.542
The destruction of Paris.

47:06.667 --> 47:09.709
You must assign to us
a reconnaissance unit.

47:18.251 --> 47:21.959
That's the Louvre, is it?
Across the street?

47:22.792 --> 47:25.376
Himmler wants a few artworks
for safekeeping.

47:26.334 --> 47:28.376
You came all this way from Berlin?

47:28.667 --> 47:30.084
Where'd you get the fuel?

47:30.376 --> 47:32.084
What do you care?

47:32.584 --> 47:34.126
We commandeered it.

47:35.709 --> 47:36.917
From fighting units?

47:37.084 --> 47:39.042
From chickens fleeing the enemy.

47:39.834 --> 47:41.876
Men you allowed
to leave the city,

47:42.042 --> 47:44.584
cowards incapable of defending it.

47:45.584 --> 47:47.042
The Bayeux Tapestry,

47:47.251 --> 47:49.792
some paintings by Rubens,
two Caravaggios,

47:49.959 --> 47:53.084
rolled up, without frames,
so they fit in the trunk.

47:53.251 --> 47:54.667
And the Mona Lisa?

47:54.959 --> 47:56.334
Himmler only wants those.

47:57.376 --> 48:00.001
Gentlemen,
I think you have arrived too late.

48:00.626 --> 48:02.459
You refuse to obey Himmler.

48:04.001 --> 48:05.751
Stupnagel, your predecessor,

48:05.917 --> 48:07.751
will be hanged today in Berlin,

48:07.917 --> 48:09.334
from a meat hook.

48:09.751 --> 48:13.167
His wife and children
will pay for his crimes also.

48:14.167 --> 48:16.751
I bet Paris is full of conspirators
like him.

48:16.917 --> 48:18.584
The blue blood club.

48:21.959 --> 48:24.792
- Any news from Hegger?
- No, sir.

48:24.959 --> 48:28.584
It must be working now.
And get those guys off my back.

48:29.292 --> 48:30.542
Lieutenant...

48:32.209 --> 48:33.459
Thank you.

48:40.126 --> 48:41.167
Gentlemen,

48:41.417 --> 48:43.209
Paris is one huge time-bomb.

48:43.376 --> 48:45.667
In a few minutes, it will explode.

48:45.834 --> 48:48.584
All the bridges, Notre-Dame,

48:48.834 --> 48:51.459
lnvalides, the Eiffel Tower...

48:51.751 --> 48:53.834
My wife wanted a postcard of it.

48:54.001 --> 48:56.084
That's all that will be left.

49:05.417 --> 49:06.542
May I?

49:06.709 --> 49:08.001
Of course.

49:13.542 --> 49:15.834
Do you like it in Paris?

49:17.209 --> 49:18.876
It's better than Russia.

49:20.792 --> 49:22.209
Where were you?

49:22.542 --> 49:26.001
In the Kharkov cauldron
with General von Choltitz.

49:59.334 --> 50:01.584
Do you know what Sippenhaft is?

50:01.751 --> 50:02.459
What?

50:02.626 --> 50:05.251
Sippenhaft.
Do you know what it is?

50:05.417 --> 50:06.292
No.

50:06.626 --> 50:10.626
It's a law, decreed
just before I arrived in Paris.

50:11.584 --> 50:12.959
I'm overjoyed.

50:13.376 --> 50:15.917
Shall I tell you
what the law says?

50:17.251 --> 50:18.792
Since two weeks ago,

50:19.001 --> 50:22.334
all German officers' families
are considered hostages.

50:22.501 --> 50:24.126
They answer for our actions.

50:24.292 --> 50:26.167
If Paris doesn't blow up,

50:26.334 --> 50:30.376
my wife and children will be arrested,
incarcerated and executed.

50:33.292 --> 50:35.001
You find it hard to believe?

50:35.876 --> 50:36.876
Here...

50:37.626 --> 50:40.834
The decree
signed in person by Adolf Hitler.

50:54.334 --> 50:57.209
Germany is scared, Consul.

50:58.167 --> 51:01.792
To fight back, it resorts
to the worst medieval practices.

51:01.959 --> 51:05.334
Blind, unconditional obedience.

51:07.167 --> 51:08.292
Enter!

51:15.417 --> 51:16.376
Gentlemen...

51:21.542 --> 51:24.209
The owner's private stock,
from the cellar.

51:32.834 --> 51:34.126
Very good.

51:36.667 --> 51:41.001
Would you care for a bite to eat?
Or a cigarette?

51:50.376 --> 51:52.501
We also have a Camembert.

51:53.292 --> 51:54.459
Thank you.

51:55.667 --> 51:56.667
Miss...

52:01.209 --> 52:02.126
Gentlemen.

52:06.251 --> 52:09.084
I have destroyed
a dozen towns in this war,

52:09.251 --> 52:11.376
mostly out of strategic objectives.

52:11.584 --> 52:15.126
I did so
with absolutely no qualms,

52:15.292 --> 52:16.959
because it was necessary.

52:17.292 --> 52:21.542
I am aware that the destruction of Paris
won't win us the war,

52:21.709 --> 52:23.542
but I love my children.

52:26.792 --> 52:28.876
My surrender sentences them to death

52:29.042 --> 52:31.959
and I doubt God will intervene
to save them.

52:32.126 --> 52:34.459
By obeying orders,
I save their lives.

52:40.792 --> 52:43.084
Were I to disobey,

52:43.251 --> 52:46.126
what child
would want a father like me?

52:50.376 --> 52:52.959
Allow me to return the question.

52:53.792 --> 52:56.251
What would you do in my shoes?

52:59.042 --> 52:59.751
Pardon me?

52:59.917 --> 53:02.459
What would you do in my shoes?

53:03.501 --> 53:04.709
In your shoes?

53:07.459 --> 53:09.376
- Well...
- Go ahead.

53:12.876 --> 53:15.459
Hundreds of thousands of lives
are at stake,

53:15.667 --> 53:17.459
including women and children.

53:18.459 --> 53:19.792
It's a simple question.

53:19.959 --> 53:22.001
What would you do in my shoes?

53:25.292 --> 53:28.501
You'd sacrifice
your wife and loved ones

53:29.001 --> 53:31.251
for a city you hardly know?

53:33.084 --> 53:34.167
Well?

53:35.042 --> 53:35.667
Hold on...

53:36.626 --> 53:38.959
I need an answer.
I need one now.

53:39.126 --> 53:41.251
What would you do in my shoes?

53:41.417 --> 53:43.251
Answer me, will you?

53:45.417 --> 53:46.792
Answer me!

53:48.209 --> 53:49.584
I don't know.

53:51.001 --> 53:52.334
Just as I thought.

53:52.792 --> 53:53.876
Enter!

53:54.334 --> 53:56.459
I've been sent by Colonel Jay.

53:57.251 --> 53:58.417
General, listen...

53:58.667 --> 54:00.917
Get out. Stand ready.

54:01.959 --> 54:02.876
We'll find a way...

54:03.084 --> 54:04.709
I told you, I won't surrender.

54:04.876 --> 54:06.292
Think of the consequences.

54:06.459 --> 54:09.292
The Americans
are on the outskirts of Paris.

54:09.459 --> 54:11.501
Your wife can surely be...

54:12.209 --> 54:13.917
Put me through to Hegger.

54:14.084 --> 54:16.917
Yes, Hegger.
At the parliament building.

54:17.084 --> 54:19.417
We'll find a way
to get your family out.

54:19.584 --> 54:23.667
Baden-Baden is on the border.
They could reach Switzerland via France.

54:23.834 --> 54:27.001
I know a group
that will be able to help them.

54:27.167 --> 54:30.084
Corporal Mayer
can drive them to Strasbourg

54:30.251 --> 54:34.667
and to the group I know.
Tomorrow, they'll be safe.

54:34.917 --> 54:38.376
I can't get through to Hegger.
The field telephone's dead.

54:41.959 --> 54:44.626
With the French engineer
to guide you.

54:44.792 --> 54:48.084
It's just across the Seine.
The parliament building.

54:48.417 --> 54:50.626
The parliament building, yes.

54:52.834 --> 54:55.959
<i>I must speak with him personally.</i>

54:56.167 --> 54:58.042
<i>Take a radio with you.</i>

54:59.251 --> 55:01.167
Yes, sir. I'm on my way.

55:06.376 --> 55:07.959
Watch out! Sniper!

55:11.876 --> 55:14.626
I can get them across the border,
at no risk.

55:14.792 --> 55:18.334
One word from you
and tomorrow they'll be in Switzerland.

55:18.501 --> 55:22.376
Why do you think
Sippenhaft was decreed

55:22.542 --> 55:24.959
the day before I was posted here?

55:25.834 --> 55:27.584
A pure coincidence? No.

55:27.751 --> 55:30.001
It's a law aimed at me personally.

55:30.167 --> 55:34.042
My family can't leave Baden-Baden
without the Gestapo after them.

55:34.209 --> 55:36.626
They'll be arrested,
incarcerated and executed.

55:39.209 --> 55:41.417
It could be worse, couldn't it?

55:41.792 --> 55:44.084
They could be sent to the camps.

55:44.876 --> 55:48.417
Ravensbruck.
Are you familiar with that name?

55:49.292 --> 55:52.417
Believe me,
in some cases, death is preferable.

55:53.209 --> 55:55.917
You did your duty
by coming this far.

55:56.084 --> 55:58.334
Now, let me do mine.

55:58.917 --> 56:00.167
If you'd be so kind...

56:20.667 --> 56:21.751
The pill bottle...

56:21.917 --> 56:22.792
Sorry?

56:23.417 --> 56:25.876
The bottle in my desk.
In the drawer.

56:26.042 --> 56:28.251
- Which one?
- Near the phone.

56:28.417 --> 56:29.334
Hurry!

56:37.667 --> 56:39.876
- How many?
- Two. Two pills.

56:46.584 --> 56:47.417
Here.

56:54.126 --> 56:55.084
Breathe deeply.

56:55.251 --> 56:56.834
Long, deep breaths.

56:58.334 --> 56:59.459
Come with me.

57:18.626 --> 57:20.167
Drink this.

57:20.709 --> 57:21.751
Thank you.

57:27.626 --> 57:29.667
This is grotesque. I'm sorry.

57:29.834 --> 57:31.376
No, not at all.

57:31.834 --> 57:34.334
It's this damn asthma that...

57:34.501 --> 57:37.376
I've had it for years
and with the heat, it...

57:39.209 --> 57:41.417
You should keep your pills on you.

57:41.584 --> 57:42.876
Thanks.

57:45.792 --> 57:47.376
How do you feel?

57:48.292 --> 57:49.376
Exhausted.

57:58.626 --> 57:59.667
Move!

58:04.292 --> 58:05.917
- Which way now?
- This way.

58:06.542 --> 58:07.959
Can we trust him?

58:08.126 --> 58:09.626
You have a better idea?

58:16.126 --> 58:18.042
Forget the war a moment.

58:21.917 --> 58:25.084
Picture yourself in five years
on this balcony.

58:26.167 --> 58:29.292
It's one day in the week,
just another day...

58:31.334 --> 58:35.001
You hear the horns of tugboats
coming up the Seine,

58:36.959 --> 58:40.459
glaziers and clothes merchants
hawking their wares,

58:40.751 --> 58:44.084
a newspaper vendor
shouting out headlines...

58:46.542 --> 58:49.709
You hear the swish
of the broom bristles,

58:49.876 --> 58:53.751
scraping the sidewalk
with a noise like an ocean tide.

58:55.751 --> 58:59.709
It's in the bold light of March,
or misty November.

59:00.251 --> 59:02.376
It is Paris
as you've never seen it,

59:02.542 --> 59:06.584
nothing like occupied Paris
5 years earlier.

59:12.626 --> 59:15.584
You come from Baden-Baden
with wife and children

59:15.751 --> 59:18.751
and you think,
I, General Dietrich von Choltitz,

59:18.959 --> 59:22.584
one day in August '44,
might have put an end to this.

59:22.751 --> 59:24.126
But I didn't.

59:28.292 --> 59:31.959
What will you feel, do you think,
at that precise moment?

59:34.834 --> 59:37.667
Generals often
have the power to destroy,

59:38.126 --> 59:40.542
rarely the power to edify.

59:43.251 --> 59:46.334
Paris would owe its existence
to you alone.

59:51.376 --> 59:52.876
Is that not worth

59:53.584 --> 59:55.917
all the glory due a conqueror?

01:00:30.501 --> 01:00:32.584
You are a fine advocate,

01:00:32.751 --> 01:00:36.042
but if I ever return
and your capital is still standing,

01:00:36.209 --> 01:00:38.167
I'll be traveling alone.

01:00:38.834 --> 01:00:42.626
My wife and children won't be with me
to admire your city.

01:00:45.584 --> 01:00:47.542
Why get me back on my feet?

01:00:47.751 --> 01:00:48.959
Pardon me?

01:00:49.459 --> 01:00:52.334
You came to my aid.
I'd like to understand why.

01:00:52.917 --> 01:00:54.542
What's to understand?

01:00:54.751 --> 01:00:57.167
You could've let me choke to death.

01:00:58.626 --> 01:01:01.376
I am a diplomat, not a soldier,
as you said.

01:01:01.542 --> 01:01:03.626
Death is not my business.

01:01:05.667 --> 01:01:10.084
Paris has only one ace in its hand
to save it from destruction.

01:01:11.501 --> 01:01:12.376
You.

01:01:12.542 --> 01:01:15.209
The Nazis here would blow it up
in a flash,

01:01:15.376 --> 01:01:17.459
but you're not like them.

01:01:18.292 --> 01:01:20.001
How would you know?

01:01:21.709 --> 01:01:25.167
You asked me what I'd do
in your shoes. I'll tell you.

01:01:26.209 --> 01:01:29.667
For nothing in the world
would I want to be in your shoes.

01:01:29.876 --> 01:01:33.834
It's not the destruction of a city
but of millions of people.

01:01:35.376 --> 01:01:37.376
Until now, you have managed

01:01:37.542 --> 01:01:40.001
to keep intact your self-respect.

01:01:40.792 --> 01:01:43.751
If you carry out
the orders of that tyrant,

01:01:44.626 --> 01:01:46.292
believe me,

01:01:47.167 --> 01:01:49.209
you'll lose it forever.

01:01:54.876 --> 01:01:57.042
General, should we get in position?

01:01:57.417 --> 01:01:58.084
What?

01:01:58.251 --> 01:01:59.959
The enemy's at the city gates.

01:02:00.126 --> 01:02:01.292
And Bressensdorf?

01:02:01.459 --> 01:02:03.542
He hasn't reported back yet.

01:02:03.751 --> 01:02:05.626
Thank you. Leave us now.

01:02:07.834 --> 01:02:10.126
Sir, there's only 20 of us here.

01:02:11.334 --> 01:02:12.542
And so?

01:02:13.792 --> 01:02:18.459
Should we set up defenses downstairs,
on the roof or on this floor?

01:02:19.584 --> 01:02:21.042
How old are you?

01:02:21.209 --> 01:02:22.251
Eighteen.

01:02:24.084 --> 01:02:27.626
All men under 20
must leave the city.

01:02:29.001 --> 01:02:32.209
We're all under 20,
except 3 or 4 of us.

01:02:32.917 --> 01:02:35.917
They stay with me
and you others go.

01:02:36.667 --> 01:02:37.834
Yes, sir.

01:02:38.126 --> 01:02:38.751
Thank you.

01:02:45.751 --> 01:02:46.917
My men are scared.

01:02:48.209 --> 01:02:50.792
They're kids. It's not their war.

01:02:52.376 --> 01:02:54.459
It's no longer yours, either.

01:02:55.917 --> 01:02:58.376
It's that of a man alone,
aging, fading,

01:02:58.542 --> 01:03:00.709
fooling himself and fooling others.

01:03:01.917 --> 01:03:03.584
A man reduced to blackmail,

01:03:03.751 --> 01:03:07.917
demanding inhuman obedience
of his generals to commit crimes.

01:03:09.209 --> 01:03:10.292
Hitler.

01:03:11.959 --> 01:03:14.459
The man had a gift, you know.

01:03:15.376 --> 01:03:19.251
He had a gift for captivating you,
giving you confidence

01:03:19.417 --> 01:03:22.709
and making you believe
in Germany's historic destiny.

01:03:23.709 --> 01:03:24.667
And today?

01:03:25.501 --> 01:03:26.209
Today...

01:03:26.376 --> 01:03:29.209
Your superiors tried to assassinate him.
Why?

01:03:29.376 --> 01:03:32.251
I can't imagine
they attempted it for no reason.

01:03:32.792 --> 01:03:35.376
I played no part in their plot.

01:03:36.876 --> 01:03:39.501
You must have an idea.
You knew them all.

01:03:39.667 --> 01:03:42.001
They weren't revolutionaries
or fanatics.

01:03:42.167 --> 01:03:44.126
So why try to kill him?

01:03:45.084 --> 01:03:46.876
They were a step ahead.

01:03:47.876 --> 01:03:48.876
Sorry?

01:03:49.751 --> 01:03:52.917
They were in contact with Hitler.
I wasn't.

01:03:57.167 --> 01:03:59.751
Two weeks
after the assassination attempt,

01:04:00.251 --> 01:04:02.126
I was summoned to Rastenburg,

01:04:02.292 --> 01:04:04.042
Hitler's headquarters.

01:04:05.292 --> 01:04:07.626
I was ready to renew my trust,

01:04:07.792 --> 01:04:10.626
to continue to believe
we had a chance.

01:04:12.084 --> 01:04:13.792
But the man I saw

01:04:13.959 --> 01:04:17.751
was absolutely not
the man I once knew.

01:04:18.584 --> 01:04:21.417
He was slobbering at the mouth.

01:04:21.876 --> 01:04:25.084
His face was wracked
with spasms and...

01:04:26.209 --> 01:04:27.709
The eyes...

01:04:30.542 --> 01:04:31.876
Those eyes.

01:04:36.042 --> 01:04:39.209
When I left Rastenburg,
I had made up my mind

01:04:39.501 --> 01:04:43.751
not to obey his orders to the letter,
to avoid unnecessary bloodshed.

01:04:43.917 --> 01:04:47.959
But since then, there is this ax
over my children's heads.

01:04:48.126 --> 01:04:51.334
Today,
I have no other way of saving them.

01:04:55.209 --> 01:04:56.292
Just one question.

01:04:56.459 --> 01:04:59.001
If you surrender Paris
without resistance,

01:04:59.167 --> 01:05:00.959
what exactly will happen?

01:05:02.167 --> 01:05:04.084
Sorry, I wasn't listening.

01:05:04.251 --> 01:05:05.751
If you don't destroy Paris,

01:05:05.917 --> 01:05:08.584
what will be the consequences?
A debacle?

01:05:10.376 --> 01:05:12.334
Something like that, yes.

01:05:12.959 --> 01:05:15.876
The frontline north of the Seine
will be shattered,

01:05:16.251 --> 01:05:18.709
with the Allies
free to strike at the Reich.

01:05:20.126 --> 01:05:22.959
And the immediate repercussions?
What happens next?

01:05:23.126 --> 01:05:24.334
If Paris falls,

01:05:24.501 --> 01:05:28.251
how will Germany and the army react
when they find out?

01:05:29.626 --> 01:05:33.417
With astonishment, at first.
But soon it will be total panic.

01:05:33.834 --> 01:05:34.917
Panic?

01:05:35.084 --> 01:05:37.667
So, risk sending your family
to Switzerland.

01:05:37.834 --> 01:05:39.792
The impact of your capitulation

01:05:39.959 --> 01:05:43.292
means your wife and children
won't be Hitler's priority.

01:05:43.459 --> 01:05:46.626
That will give us a few days to act.

01:05:46.917 --> 01:05:49.709
If I capitulate,
I'll be arrested immediately.

01:05:49.876 --> 01:05:51.417
How can I do anything then?

01:05:51.917 --> 01:05:53.626
Leave it all to me.

01:05:55.792 --> 01:05:56.876
To you?

01:05:59.501 --> 01:06:01.251
What guarantees do I have?

01:06:02.251 --> 01:06:04.292
You have two.
First, Caporal Mayer.

01:06:04.459 --> 01:06:07.584
He drives your family
from Baden-Baden to Strasbourg,

01:06:07.751 --> 01:06:12.001
<i>on to Muhouse, around the Aura,
to Annemasse, 'm Haute-Savdm.</i>

01:06:12.292 --> 01:06:15.584
Driving all night,
they'll be there tomorrow morning.

01:06:15.751 --> 01:06:17.709
Why not go straight to Basie?

01:06:20.334 --> 01:06:23.626
It's closer, true,
but the border's tightly guarded.

01:06:24.626 --> 01:06:26.917
From Annemasse,
it's quicker and safer.

01:06:27.084 --> 01:06:29.542
No mountains to climb,
the border's a formality...

01:06:29.709 --> 01:06:32.376
Your family
will be in Geneva in no time.

01:06:32.542 --> 01:06:35.292
And that's where Chantecler is based.

01:06:35.459 --> 01:06:36.417
That group

01:06:37.001 --> 01:06:38.876
is your second guarantee.

01:06:39.292 --> 01:06:41.709
How far is Annemasse from the border?

01:06:43.917 --> 01:06:44.917
Under a kilometer.

01:06:45.084 --> 01:06:46.126
Altitude?

01:06:46.459 --> 01:06:47.667
400 meters, at most.

01:06:47.834 --> 01:06:49.834
- No mountains to climb?
- None.

01:06:50.001 --> 01:06:52.292
Your family won't be the first.

01:06:52.459 --> 01:06:54.459
It's not a difficult route.

01:06:55.792 --> 01:06:56.917
You'll go with them?

01:06:57.084 --> 01:07:01.251
Up to the border. I'll wait
for confirmation they're in Switzerland.

01:07:03.667 --> 01:07:06.917
Chantecler?
Never heard of that group.

01:07:07.084 --> 01:07:10.542
Thank God!
Or your family wouldn't stand a chance.

01:07:10.709 --> 01:07:13.751
There's no risk, I promise you.

01:07:17.084 --> 01:07:19.501
I need to be sure.

01:07:19.667 --> 01:07:21.042
I require solid proof.

01:07:22.751 --> 01:07:26.084
I've already
used their services twice before.

01:07:26.376 --> 01:07:27.251
You?

01:07:28.626 --> 01:07:30.209
To what ends?

01:07:33.251 --> 01:07:35.709
To help a French family,
some time ago.

01:07:35.876 --> 01:07:37.501
And more recently...

01:07:38.126 --> 01:07:39.209
My wife.

01:07:39.667 --> 01:07:41.501
Your wife? I don't understand.

01:07:43.292 --> 01:07:45.626
My wife is Jewish, Mr. Choltitz.

01:07:46.084 --> 01:07:48.709
She lives in Lausanne now.
In safety.

01:07:53.542 --> 01:07:56.334
I'd like to help you further but...

01:07:58.209 --> 01:08:01.376
I cannot put myself in your shoes.

01:08:26.917 --> 01:08:28.626
Lieutenant Bressensdorf!

01:08:29.626 --> 01:08:31.042
First Lieutenant Hegger?

01:08:31.209 --> 01:08:32.251
That's me.

01:08:32.792 --> 01:08:33.751
Are you ready?

01:08:33.917 --> 01:08:35.709
Sure. We just need the order.

01:08:35.876 --> 01:08:37.292
That's why I'm here.

01:08:37.667 --> 01:08:40.292
Guys, Paris gets
its firework display!

01:08:40.626 --> 01:08:42.542
I need to confirm I'm here.

01:08:43.376 --> 01:08:44.542
Confirm?

01:08:45.626 --> 01:08:48.209
It only works up on the roof.

01:08:48.459 --> 01:08:49.542
To the roof, then.

01:08:49.709 --> 01:08:50.792
The General too.

01:08:50.959 --> 01:08:52.751
Fine. The General too.

01:08:53.709 --> 01:08:54.626
Who's he?

01:08:54.792 --> 01:08:56.126
MY guide.

01:09:31.209 --> 01:09:32.292
Clear out!

01:09:35.459 --> 01:09:36.709
Listen carefully.

01:09:42.417 --> 01:09:43.667
Just a moment.

01:10:01.001 --> 01:10:02.751
That's my final order.

01:10:26.501 --> 01:10:28.459
Operation canceled.

01:10:28.626 --> 01:10:30.459
Paris won't explode.

01:10:41.167 --> 01:10:42.834
Shit! Dammit!

01:10:43.001 --> 01:10:44.667
We worked our asses off!

01:10:44.834 --> 01:10:48.084
3 days and nights,
without eating, shitting or sleeping!

01:10:48.251 --> 01:10:50.876
All for nothing? Not a chance.

01:10:51.084 --> 01:10:52.542
3, 6 and 9, in position.

01:10:53.001 --> 01:10:54.084
Hegger!

01:10:55.292 --> 01:10:57.001
Yes, 2nd Lieutenant?

01:11:00.001 --> 01:11:00.792
Can it!

01:11:27.792 --> 01:11:30.084
In Annemasse, give her this.

01:11:31.001 --> 01:11:32.876
Engraved with our wedding date.

01:11:35.167 --> 01:11:36.251
She'll believe you.

01:11:40.376 --> 01:11:43.542
My loved ones are in your hands.

01:11:45.667 --> 01:11:48.584
Nothing will happen to them.
I give you my word.

01:11:51.751 --> 01:11:52.792
Well...

01:11:53.501 --> 01:11:55.501
My career ends here.

01:11:56.792 --> 01:11:58.667
Everything will be fine.

01:11:59.417 --> 01:12:03.876
Being the man who didn't destroy Paris
is a real credit to you.

01:12:07.709 --> 01:12:09.876
Let's have a drink, shall we?

01:12:10.459 --> 01:12:15.084
You have an excellent whisky
tucked away in this cabinet.

01:12:16.417 --> 01:12:18.376
How do you know?

01:12:18.667 --> 01:12:21.209
Rest assured, I won't tell the Brits.

01:12:22.167 --> 01:12:24.959
You like it straight, don't you?

01:12:26.084 --> 01:12:28.626
You're a funny fellow, Mr. Nordling.

01:12:30.626 --> 01:12:33.251
Is there anything you don't know?

01:12:35.126 --> 01:12:36.834
About what, General?

01:12:37.001 --> 01:12:38.459
About me.

01:12:39.542 --> 01:12:40.292
You?

01:12:41.417 --> 01:12:43.084
I must make a confession.

01:12:43.251 --> 01:12:47.209
The mirror over the fireplace
is a two-way mirror.

01:12:50.167 --> 01:12:51.667
Miss Howard was a flirt

01:12:51.834 --> 01:12:54.709
and Napoleon Ill
was either as jealous as a tiger

01:12:54.876 --> 01:12:57.709
or a terrible voyeur, right?

01:12:59.292 --> 01:13:01.751
I'd say he was a terrible voyeur.

01:13:02.209 --> 01:13:04.292
And I'd agree with you.

01:13:06.459 --> 01:13:09.542
To the courtesan
who led me to you.

01:13:15.334 --> 01:13:16.751
You're leaving?

01:13:17.834 --> 01:13:19.417
I think it's time.

01:13:25.501 --> 01:13:26.584
Wait!

01:13:27.917 --> 01:13:31.626
You need a safe-conduct
or you'll never reach Annemasse.

01:13:31.792 --> 01:13:34.709
The German army
still holds half of France.

01:13:36.959 --> 01:13:38.167
Excuse me.

01:13:44.292 --> 01:13:46.292
Hotel Meurice, yes.

01:13:51.834 --> 01:13:53.459
The French!

01:13:54.459 --> 01:13:55.417
A problem?

01:13:55.584 --> 01:13:58.167
No, it's Parisian humor,
I suppose.

01:13:58.334 --> 01:14:01.334
A man asking to book a room tonight.

01:14:03.334 --> 01:14:06.417
You think
they'll all take turns to call?

01:14:16.376 --> 01:14:18.001
Another reservation?

01:14:18.167 --> 01:14:21.334
No, that one wanted to see me dead.

01:14:22.709 --> 01:14:25.334
I fear he's in the majority.

01:14:36.959 --> 01:14:39.459
Hurry, you've no time to waste.

01:14:41.001 --> 01:14:42.626
Thank you, General.

01:14:46.667 --> 01:14:47.959
Church bells?

01:14:49.542 --> 01:14:52.126
Who are they burying at this time?

01:14:54.042 --> 01:14:56.459
I guess Paris is burying
the Occupation.

01:14:56.667 --> 01:15:00.001
The bells announce
the Allies' entry into Paris.

01:15:00.167 --> 01:15:02.042
So, they're tolling for me.

01:15:06.334 --> 01:15:07.751
Farewell, General.

01:15:49.334 --> 01:15:50.001
General...

01:15:50.959 --> 01:15:52.042
Mayer?

01:15:52.542 --> 01:15:55.167
We were stopped 20 km from here.

01:15:55.334 --> 01:15:56.334
I'm sorry.

01:15:57.126 --> 01:15:59.667
An enemy roadblock,
impossible to get past.

01:16:00.542 --> 01:16:02.417
They opened fire on us.

01:16:03.084 --> 01:16:05.667
You have to get to Baden-Baden!

01:16:11.251 --> 01:16:12.959
You don't understand.

01:16:13.584 --> 01:16:15.501
They weren't there by chance.

01:16:15.667 --> 01:16:17.126
They were French

01:16:17.584 --> 01:16:19.542
and they were all over us.

01:16:19.709 --> 01:16:22.459
Without Alfred at the wheel,
we'd be dead.

01:16:22.626 --> 01:16:24.042
The Resistance?

01:16:54.584 --> 01:16:55.917
Men...

01:17:00.126 --> 01:17:02.876
One last time, we must fight together.

01:17:04.001 --> 01:17:07.917
As a soldier among soldiers,
I shall be at your side.

01:18:51.792 --> 01:18:53.126
My compliments.

01:18:54.209 --> 01:18:56.084
De Gaulle will speak at city hall.

01:18:56.251 --> 01:18:58.084
He wants you at his side.

01:19:01.376 --> 01:19:02.667
What's that?

01:19:14.376 --> 01:19:15.834
Shall we take the car?

01:19:16.376 --> 01:19:18.751
On a day like this? You're kidding?

01:19:19.376 --> 01:19:20.584
Let's walk!

01:19:36.667 --> 01:19:41.292
<i>General Choltitz was taken prisoner
by the Allies and released in 1947.</i>

01:19:41.459 --> 01:19:46.209
<i>Thanks to the German debacle,
his family was not arrested.</i>

01:19:47.042 --> 01:19:50.584
<i>Nordling and Choltitz met one more time.
In Paris, in 1955.</i>

01:19:50.751 --> 01:19:55.626
<i>The diplomat gave the general
the medal awarded to him after the war.</i>

01:19:55.792 --> 01:19:58.292
<i>Specially minted,
this unique medal shows...</i>

01:20:00.042 --> 01:20:04.292
<i>Paris breaking its chains.</i>

01:20:24.501 --> 01:20:28.167
