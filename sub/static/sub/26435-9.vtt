We're always gonna kill you, okay?!

43:39.080 --> 43:41.356
It's just what people do now.

43:41.440 --> 43:44.512
Everybody still alive's a threat.

43:44.640 --> 43:46.278
It's us or them.

43:48.920 --> 43:51.673
How many people in your group?

43:51.760 --> 43:53.910
- I already--
- The truth!

43:54.000 --> 43:55.195
It <i>is</i> the truth!

43:55.280 --> 43:56.918
- Don't lie to me!
- My mom!

43:57.000 --> 43:58.195
It's just my mom.

43:58.320 --> 43:59.594
She's a good person.

43:59.680 --> 44:01.830
Please don't go looking for her.

44:01.920 --> 44:03.433
[Crying] Please.

44:03.520 --> 44:06.876
She's just one woman, out there alone.

44:06.960 --> 44:09.554
You said your people were never alone.

44:09.640 --> 44:12.393
She-- She was at the cemetery.

44:12.480 --> 44:14.994
She got separated, but just her.

44:17.120 --> 44:19.350
- Liar!
- Please, I'm telling-- [Gasps]

44:19.440 --> 44:21.158
No! No, I told you the truth!

44:21.240 --> 44:23.595
- I told you what was gonna happen!
- Daryl!

44:23.720 --> 44:25.518
- Shut up!
- That was everything!

44:25.640 --> 44:27.836
- Please! Please! Let go of me!
- Daryl, stop!

44:27.920 --> 44:29.718
Please, Daryl,
please don't kill me, please.

44:29.800 --> 44:31.791
Please.

44:31.880 --> 44:34.440
[Crying] Please.

44:53.880 --> 44:57.714
[Cell door creaks]

44:57.840 --> 45:00.229
[Lock clicks]

45:03.720 --> 45:06.109
I thought I told you to stay quiet.

45:06.200 --> 45:07.395
She's just a girl.

45:07.480 --> 45:09.915
You wanna know
what your place is here?

45:10.000 --> 45:13.470
It's right where you're at,
for as long as it takes for you

45:13.560 --> 45:15.517
to figure out how to wise your ass up.

45:15.600 --> 45:18.035
Daryl.

45:18.120 --> 45:21.476
Daryl! Wait!

45:21.560 --> 45:25.349
[Door closes]

45:31.560 --> 45:33.915
Woman: Thank you.

45:40.960 --> 45:42.473
What?

45:42.560 --> 45:45.598
I said thank you.

45:45.720 --> 45:48.234
For saving me.

45:51.160 --> 45:53.674
I had to.

45:55.600 --> 45:58.069
Couldn't let him do
what he was gonna do to you.

46:02.600 --> 46:04.193
I'm Henry.

46:09.600 --> 46:11.876
I'm Lydia.

46:16.880 --> 46:19.315
Nice to meet you.

46:41.240 --> 46:42.878
[Gunshot]

46:46.640 --> 46:48.950
[Grunts]

46:52.240 --> 46:54.436
All right, slow down, kid.

46:54.520 --> 46:57.353
I know you said you'd shoot, but...

46:57.440 --> 46:58.760
damn.

47:01.640 --> 47:04.200
Whole lot of people
are out lookin' for you.

47:05.840 --> 47:08.958
I told you there was nothing out there.

47:09.040 --> 47:11.156
You sure as shit did.

47:11.240 --> 47:12.355
Language!

47:12.440 --> 47:14.829
I'm a kid, asshole.

47:14.920 --> 47:18.959
Yeah. Yeah, you are.

47:19.040 --> 47:20.951
[Grunts]

47:21.040 --> 47:22.269
What can I say?

47:22.400 --> 47:25.119
I like to swear in front of my friends.

47:25.200 --> 47:27.350
People that know some shit.

47:27.440 --> 47:28.635
[Sighs]

47:34.040 --> 47:37.271
Thanks for lettin' me borrow that.

47:43.680 --> 47:45.876
You're goin' back to Alexandria?

47:45.960 --> 47:47.189
Yep.

47:48.320 --> 47:50.516
Cell and all.

47:50.600 --> 47:52.989
Why?

47:53.080 --> 47:55.390
'Cause you were right.

47:55.480 --> 47:58.791
I got a good look outside my 10x10,

47:58.880 --> 48:01.633
and there is nothin' here for me.

48:01.720 --> 48:03.199
Not anymore.

48:03.280 --> 48:05.430
So you go back.

48:05.520 --> 48:07.079
Then what?

48:10.520 --> 48:13.433
I will let you know when I know.

48:28.040 --> 48:31.351
Man: How's that look?

48:35.320 --> 48:38.551
<i>H9'!-</i>

48:40.920 --> 48:43.150
Hey, you're one of us now.

48:43.240 --> 48:45.231
It's good to have you.

48:45.320 --> 48:46.674
Thanks.

48:46.760 --> 48:49.229
What's got you up here?

48:50.920 --> 48:52.274
Alden.

48:52.360 --> 48:53.794
He's my...

48:53.880 --> 48:55.029
Well...

48:55.160 --> 48:57.470
not even sure what to call it.

48:57.560 --> 49:00.518
It's all so new, so...

49:00.600 --> 49:04.036
I've got one of those, too.

49:06.160 --> 49:08.470
Luke's a survivor.

49:08.560 --> 49:10.995
Alden's in good hands.

49:26.040 --> 49:28.714
[Walker growling]

49:28.800 --> 49:31.519
You better warm up
those vocal cords, mister.

49:31.600 --> 49:34.069
All right, we'll see.

49:34.160 --> 49:36.231
[Walker growling]

49:40.720 --> 49:44.998
Ooh, I got it, I got it.

49:50.600 --> 49:53.592
[Growling stops]

49:57.200 --> 50:00.158
That's weird.

50:21.800 --> 50:24.792
Trail ends here.
