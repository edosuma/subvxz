09:01.207 --> 09:02.435
I can't fight her.

09:02.508 --> 09:04.738
But... but I can't let
her destroy the city.

09:04.810 --> 09:06.402
I've failed everyone.

09:06.479 --> 09:07.969
Not true, creator.

09:08.047 --> 09:09.776
You haven't failed Neptr.

09:09.849 --> 09:13.910
Even if everyone burns,
you'll still have <i>me,</i> creator.

09:13.986 --> 09:16.079
[Whirring]

09:22.562 --> 09:23.494
[Squish!]

09:23.563 --> 09:24.427
[Sniffs]

09:24.497 --> 09:26.829
[Munching]

09:26.899 --> 09:27.991
Mmm!

09:28.067 --> 09:29.261
No.

09:29.335 --> 09:31.929
Why can't I just like a girl?

09:34.574 --> 09:36.041
[Hiss!]

09:36.108 --> 09:37.268
Ow!

09:37.343 --> 09:39.777
Huh?

09:39.845 --> 09:42.143
[Crying]

09:42.214 --> 09:43.841
[Coughing]

09:46.586 --> 09:47.450
[Hiss!]

09:47.520 --> 09:50.216
Oh!

[Coughs]

09:52.592 --> 09:54.321
[Gasps]

09:54.393 --> 09:56.486
[Gasps, coughs]

09:56.562 --> 10:00.464
Did I... do something... cool
while I was knocked out?

10:00.533 --> 10:02.398
I understand now.

10:02.468 --> 10:04.561
You're a <i>water</i> elemental.

10:04.637 --> 10:05.604
What?!

10:05.671 --> 10:06.865
You're my opposite.

10:06.939 --> 10:08.668
You create water.

10:08.741 --> 10:10.208
What? Cry?
No, I ju...

10:10.276 --> 10:11.368
Yeah.

10:11.444 --> 10:13.207
You cry and cry all the time.

10:13.279 --> 10:14.439
N-no! No!

10:14.513 --> 10:15.912
I-I-I don't
usually do that.

10:15.982 --> 10:17.313
That's your power.

10:17.383 --> 10:18.680
No! No-no-no-no-no-no!

10:18.751 --> 10:20.685
Finn, even if we
like each other,

10:20.753 --> 10:22.687
we're going to
hurt each other.

10:22.755 --> 10:24.313
No!
W-we don't have to!

10:24.390 --> 10:25.982
I can take it.

10:26.058 --> 10:28.720
I-I mean, can't we try?

10:28.794 --> 10:31.160
You would defy nature for me?

10:31.230 --> 10:33.164
Uh... yeah.

10:33.232 --> 10:34.824
Whatevs.

10:34.900 --> 10:36.458
[Hiss!]

10:36.535 --> 10:37.900
[Whimpers]

10:37.970 --> 10:39.665
Aah.

10:39.739 --> 10:41.366
Bye, Finn.

10:41.440 --> 10:43.203
Goodbye, Lady.

10:43.275 --> 10:46.870
JAKE:
Finn! Oh, my glob, man!

10:46.946 --> 10:48.311
Everyone's dead, man!

10:48.381 --> 10:50.349
They're all burned!

10:50.416 --> 10:52.884
There's barbecued
bods everywhere!

10:52.952 --> 10:54.317
Wha-a-a-t?!

10:54.387 --> 10:55.649
I'm just kidding.

10:55.721 --> 10:57.621
I saved them.
Everyone's fine.

10:57.690 --> 10:58.884
See?

10:58.958 --> 10:59.890
[Goblins laugh, murmur]

10:59.959 --> 11:00.948
Yeah, we're alive.

11:01.027 --> 11:03.860
So, how'd everything
go with Flame Princess?

11:03.929 --> 11:06.898
She hugged me,
then left.

11:06.966 --> 11:08.194
Whoa!

11:08.267 --> 11:10.292
How did it feel?

11:10.369 --> 11:11.859
It hurt.
