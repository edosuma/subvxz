00:05.051 --> 00:06.253
My name is Drake Parker.

00:06.313 --> 00:07.829
I'm Josh Nichols.

00:07.943 --> 00:09.886
I should probably be doin' my homework.

00:10.008 --> 00:11.611
I'm just doin' a little homework here.

00:11.758 --> 00:13.222
But it's more fun to do this.

00:16.623 --> 00:18.298
Man, I'm thirsty.
- Man, I'm thirsty.

00:26.182 --> 00:28.581
I live here with my mom and my little sister Megan.

00:28.743 --> 00:31.456
I got a great family,
even though it's just me and my dad..

00:31.743 --> 00:32.856
 I love that guy.

00:33.243 --> 00:34.856
I love girls.

00:37.005 --> 00:38.799
So my mom's been datin' this guy.

00:39.057 --> 00:41.015
So my dad's been dating this woman..

00:41.298 --> 00:42.491
She's really great.

00:42.738 --> 00:46.115
He's okay, but he's got this
kid that goes to my school.

00:46.396 --> 00:48.295
She has a son that
goes to my school.

00:48.534 --> 00:49.529
Drake.
- Josh.

00:49.899 --> 00:52.079
It's not that I have anything against Josh.

00:52.326 --> 00:54.527
I really don't know Drake all that well.

00:54.983 --> 00:56.726
But he seems kinda..
- But he seems kinda..

00:56.987 --> 00:57.645
Okay.

00:57.691 --> 00:58.663
Unusual.

Drake!

01:22.327 --> 01:23.284
Hey mom.

01:23.803 --> 01:25.276
Mr. Nichols..

01:25.414 --> 01:27.363
Wat happened?
I heard screaming.

01:28.542 --> 01:30.888
It's alright, son, there's nothin' to mop here.

01:31.203 --> 01:32.268
Josh..

01:32.767 --> 01:35.000
What are you.. what are you doing here?
Wh-what's he doing here?

01:35.171 --> 01:36.179
Tell 'im!

01:36.192 --> 01:38.209
Wait..
Uh, Drake, quick, go get your sister.

01:38.814 --> 01:40.180
Megan!

01:41.876 --> 01:44.228
Ughh, are they done sucking face, yet?

01:46.110 --> 01:47.547
Kids..

01:47.556 --> 01:50.664
Josh's dad and I have been going
out for a long time now and..

01:51.209 --> 01:53.109
we have some news!

01:55.467 --> 01:57.189
You bought me a dirt bike?

01:58.446 --> 02:00.323
No..

02:01.047 --> 02:03.021
we're getting married!
- We're getting married!

02:06.755 --> 02:08.109
You're getting ma-ma-mar..

02:08.596 --> 02:11.199
Yeah, we're gonna be one big 'ole happy family!

02:11.584 --> 02:12.570
Wait.. wait..

02:12.850 --> 02:13.872
you mean..

02:14.188 --> 02:16.860
he's gonna be-be my-my stepfather?

02:20.553 --> 02:22.276
And you!

02:22.855 --> 02:24.968
You're gonna be my..

02:25.950 --> 02:27.513
He's gonna be my..

02:27.866 --> 02:30.152
Hug me, brother!

03:28.157 --> 03:30.197
Drake?
Josh is downstairs.

03:30.443 --> 03:31.112
Oh really?

03:31.288 --> 03:33.010
'Cause I was just writin' a song about him.

03:33.115 --> 03:35.887
It's called:
"I'm not sharing my room with Josh".

03:38.284 --> 03:40.642
Look, I know this is gonna be a big adjustment.

03:40.853 --> 03:42.365
But I need you to give this a chance.

03:42.611 --> 03:45.605
But mom, he's goofy, he's clammy..

03:45.613 --> 03:46.668
Hiya, Drake!

03:46.703 --> 03:48.596
He's here..

03:49.631 --> 03:51.073
I brought you some licorice.

03:51.164 --> 03:54.380
the red kind. I know some people like th
black kind.. But I thought I'd play it safe and..

03:57.318 --> 03:59.201
Mom, don't do this to me.

04:01.013 --> 04:02.773
I shoulda got the black kind, right?

04:04.379 --> 04:06.084
Have a good time, boys.

04:06.229 --> 04:08.004
Wow, cool room!

04:08.270 --> 04:09.992
Check out the bed!

04:10.054 --> 04:12.279
Wait, wait!
No, n-n-n-n-no!

04:15.641 --> 04:18.548
Dude, these sheets match my jamies!

04:20.322 --> 04:22.185
So, where are you gonna sleep?

04:22.547 --> 04:24.683
There!
I sleep there!

04:24.719 --> 04:26.320
You sleep on the couch.

04:26.566 --> 04:27.747
The couch?

04:27.959 --> 04:30.599
I don't know, I have lumbar problems.

04:33.329 --> 04:35.647
Man, how much junk did you bring?

04:38.266 --> 04:40.298
Who reads the school newspaper?

04:40.806 --> 04:42.550
I do, it's good.

04:42.551 --> 04:43.824
It's stupid.

04:43.915 --> 04:46.307
Ooh, look..
A poem by janitor Jones:

04:46.547 --> 04:48.973
<i>The toilet. Don't soil it.</i>

04:50.819 --> 04:53.341
That's clever.
- Right.

04:53.548 --> 04:56.996
Oh, and here's the worst:
Miss Nancy's advice column.

04:57.041 --> 04:58.113
What a load.

04:58.239 --> 05:00.350
A load o' good!

05:00.581 --> 05:02.705
I think Miss Nancy gives great advice.

05:03.236 --> 05:05.501
Whatever, man.
I'm gonna go play some hoops.

05:06.027 --> 05:07.997
Uh, Drake?
When will you be back?

05:08.455 --> 05:10.260
I don't know..
A few hours?

05:10.350 --> 05:14.352
Good.
I.. mean.. have fun with the hoops and what not.

05:19.688 --> 05:22.177
Now it's my turn to kiss you.

05:24.490 --> 05:27.470
Now it's my turn to kiss you.

05:28.598 --> 05:31.835
Now it's my turn to throw up.

05:33.819 --> 05:35.969
Don't you have something to do?

05:36.084 --> 05:37.446
Yeah, I'm gonna go play some ball.

05:37.635 --> 05:39.614
Well did you ask your brother if he wants to play?

05:39.670 --> 05:43.490
You know mom..
I really don't think Josh is the basketball type.

05:43.500 --> 05:45.689
Sure he is!
I taught him myself.

05:45.747 --> 05:46.931
Here, toss me the rock.

05:56.291 --> 05:57.373
Think fast!

06:02.666 --> 06:04.690
Lamps don't think that fast.

06:06.081 --> 06:08.170
Just go ask Josh to play.

06:11.969 --> 06:15.522
Hey, Josh.
You don't want to go play some basketba..

06:18.541 --> 06:19.807
I can explain!

06:20.763 --> 06:21.888
I can explain!

06:22.335 --> 06:25.254
Mom!
Josh is dressed like a freak!

06:25.866 --> 06:27.696
I can explain!

06:30.711 --> 06:33.895
Why are you dressed like Queen Latifah?

06:35.112 --> 06:39.410
Because I.. I..
Oh, I can't tell you!

06:39.569 --> 06:41.750
Mom! Josh is dressed like..
- Shh!

06:41.780 --> 06:44.834
Alright! I'll tell you, but you
gotta swear to keep it a secret.

06:44.902 --> 06:46.771
Fine, I swear.
Now talk.

06:46.858 --> 06:48.440
Alright..

06:49.003 --> 06:51.078
I'm uh..

06:51.360 --> 06:53.188
I'm..

06:53.270 --> 06:56.355
Miss.. Nanchh..

06:58.034 --> 06:58.987
What?

07:00.513 --> 07:05.153
I'm Miss Nancy, okay?
I am.. Miss Nancy.

07:05.722 --> 07:08.255
Wait..
From the advice column?

07:08.260 --> 07:09.906
From the school newspaper?

07:10.223 --> 07:13.177
You're Miss Nancy?
- Yes.

07:17.806 --> 07:19.100
Quit laughing.

07:19.115 --> 07:22.800
Being Miss Nancy's very important to me.
I help people with their problems.

07:22.900 --> 07:25.259
You can't help people by wearing pants?

07:27.028 --> 07:32.689
You don't understand. I need the dress.
I-I can't write good advice without wearing it.

07:33.130 --> 07:37.019
You want some good advice?
Stop dressin' like a lady!

07:37.611 --> 07:43.035
If dressin' like a lady helps me help others,
then dress like a lady I shall!

07:47.596 --> 07:49.842
Dear Miss Nancy,
- Hey that-- Give me that!

07:50.041 --> 07:53.445
My boyfriend doesn't understand me.
He's never romantic.

07:53.563 --> 07:58.131
I wish he would just bring me flowers, or write me poems,
or cook me romantic dinners.

07:58.924 --> 08:01.632
That's for Miss Nancy's eyes only!
- Wait a second..

08:01.942 --> 08:05.282
Purple ink?
Dots her i's with little hearts?

08:05.426 --> 08:07.578
This letter is from Tiffany Margolis.

08:11.358 --> 08:13.766
Quit sniffin' my mail!

08:15.105 --> 08:18.268
Dude, Tiffany Margolis is like the hottest girl in school.

08:20.420 --> 08:21.686
But, hey..

08:22.402 --> 08:24.881
She's not happy with her boyfriend.

08:25.166 --> 08:28.998
What are you thinking..
What are you thinking?!

08:29.633 --> 08:33.572
Poor Tiffany..
So sad.. So lonely..

08:33.985 --> 08:35.993
Sooo hott.

08:36.726 --> 08:39.133
Yeah..
I think I can help her.

08:39.232 --> 08:44.395
No.. No, I'm not gonna let you
use my letter for your own selfish desires.

08:44.725 --> 08:48.500
Fine, then I'll just tell the whole world
that my new stepbrother Josh Nichols..

08:48.668 --> 08:50.566
is the real live Miss Nancy.

08:51.359 --> 08:53.672
You're not that evil.

08:56.698 --> 08:58.577
People of the world, listen up!

08:58.623 --> 09:03.207
Josh Nichols is Miss Na.. Hey! Hey!
My spine! My spine!

09:04.727 --> 09:08.463
You can't tell people I'm Miss Nancy.
You'll ruin everything!

09:08.562 --> 09:12.240
Fine.
Then don't stop me from "helping" Tiffany. Deal?

09:12.920 --> 09:14.907
Alright..
- Alright?

09:15.089 --> 09:16.352
Alright.

09:17.378 --> 09:20.190
Are those real?
- Stop that!

09:28.041 --> 09:30.248
Beauty..
Beauty..

09:31.016 --> 09:33.125
Rhymes with.. snooty?

09:33.357 --> 09:35.643
No..
Fruity!

09:35.918 --> 09:37.190
No..

09:38.643 --> 09:41.188
Beauty..
- What are you writing?

09:41.443 --> 09:45.004
Oh nothin', just a poem.

09:46.017 --> 09:50.034
You write poetry?
- I know.. It's dumb.

09:50.845 --> 09:54.114
No, no..
I don't think it's dumb at all.

09:54.303 --> 09:57.320
Is this for a class?
- Naw, it's for a person.

09:59.157 --> 10:04.783
Well it would be for a person
if I had a person for it to be for.

10:06.922 --> 10:11.203
I better go.
I gotta go download a recipe off the internet.

10:12.289 --> 10:14.255
A recipe?
You cook?

10:14.631 --> 10:17.052
When I'm not picking flowers.
Listen, uh..

10:17.062 --> 10:18.473
Tiffany.
- Drake.

10:18.777 --> 10:22.005
I don't know if you're doin' anything Friday night.
- I'm not.

10:22.099 --> 10:27.468
Really? Maybe I could cook you some dinner?
- That would be nice.

10:27.629 --> 10:28.905
So it's a date?

10:29.481 --> 10:32.763
So.. it is.
- Cool.

10:33.993 --> 10:35.280
See ya.

10:38.047 --> 10:39.931
That was too easy.

10:40.814 --> 10:42.184
Evil.

10:43.223 --> 10:45.122
Evil!

10:50.441 --> 10:53.240
Drake, Josh, your dinner's on the table.

10:53.514 --> 10:55.110
Okay.
- Thanks!

11:15.705 --> 11:17.093
No way!

11:17.375 --> 11:21.279
What's the whole reason you do
your Miss Nancy advice column?

11:21.461 --> 11:25.400
To help people with their
problems and/or issues.

11:25.991 --> 11:31.429
So, if I buy Tiffany some flowers, write her a
couple poems, and cook her a nice romantic dinner..

11:31.450 --> 11:34.316
that will solve her problem, won't it?

11:34.960 --> 11:38.215
Wait..
You know how to cook?

11:38.463 --> 11:39.456
No..

11:39.821 --> 11:42.023
But I hear you do.
- No!

11:42.315 --> 11:44.918
No, no sir, I'm not cooking dinner for Tiffany.

11:44.979 --> 11:48.500
I know who Miss Nancy is!
I know who Miss Nancy is!

11:48.510 --> 11:50.423
Okay!
Alright, I'll cook the dinner.

11:50.659 --> 11:51.877
Hand-licker!

11:53.727 --> 11:55.204
Come on, let's eat.

12:20.001 --> 12:21.841
That's mine!
That's mine!

12:38.964 --> 12:40.310
The hose!
- What hose?

12:40.325 --> 12:42.020
The hose!
- What hose?

12:42.474 --> 12:43.671
The window!

13:14.554 --> 13:18.073
Drake, this ravioli is amazing.
What's it called?

13:18.083 --> 13:25.602
Oh, well.. Well you know it's..
It's ravioli from a.. from a llama...

13:26.476 --> 13:29.149
I've never heard of it.
- Neither've I.

13:31.180 --> 13:33.330
Who's that?
- Josh!

13:33.338 --> 13:34.602
Hi.

13:34.825 --> 13:37.016
I know you..
You go to our school, right?

13:37.873 --> 13:39.313
Yeah.

13:40.888 --> 13:46.831
Ac-actually we're stepbrothers and Josh
isn't supposed to be here right now.

13:46.832 --> 13:50.646
I can't stay in the kitchen forever.
- Why not?

13:50.841 --> 13:53.201
I have to use the little boy's room.

13:53.421 --> 13:56.024
There's a sink, in the kitchen.

13:56.858 --> 13:59.101
Josh, did you try some of this ravioli
that Drake made?

13:59.109 --> 14:00.664
It's incredible.

14:00.780 --> 14:02.883
Oh, is it?

14:03.753 --> 14:06.774
Now, tell me Drake..

14:07.045 --> 14:10.203
How do you make it?

14:12.099 --> 14:15.615
You know, it-it's really time for dessert.
Tiffany, I'll take your plate.

14:17.400 --> 14:21.909
You know, your stepbrother is really something.
- Yeah, he's somethin' alright.

14:22.166 --> 14:27.746
I mean, he's so sensitive, you know?
The flowers, the poetry, this awesome dinner.

14:27.750 --> 14:30.708
Man my boyfriend never does any of this stuff.
- I know.

14:31.010 --> 14:35.120
I mean..
I know what you mean.

14:36.170 --> 14:38.406
Who's that?
- I don't know.

14:39.885 --> 14:42.031
Alright, alright, I'm coming.

14:45.757 --> 14:47.737
Buck!
- Hi.

14:48.583 --> 14:50.587
So! It's true!
- What?..

14:50.621 --> 14:52.671
That I have a concussion?

14:54.112 --> 14:57.604
I turn my back for five seconds
and you're out on a date with..

14:57.881 --> 15:02.739
With this clown?!
- Trouble.. Breathing!

15:03.751 --> 15:08.348
I can date whoever I want!
- Yeah? Well you can't date a guy with no head!

15:09.870 --> 15:13.527
You're hamburger meat.
You understand me?

15:13.843 --> 15:17.409
I'm a vegetarian!
- Monday..

15:17.756 --> 15:20.880
3 'o clock.
You and me.

15:20.970 --> 15:23.400
Have an ambulance ready.

15:27.518 --> 15:30.116
That was so romantic.

15:30.658 --> 15:32.352
And dessert is here.

15:32.970 --> 15:34.936
Josh I thought you had to pee.

15:35.973 --> 15:37.446
Done.

15:50.324 --> 15:52.932
How could you get me into a fight with Buck?

15:53.025 --> 15:57.002
This is my fault?
- Let me think.. Yes.

15:58.649 --> 16:03.259
You realize he's gonna destroy me.
- He's not gonna destroy you.

16:03.270 --> 16:06.401
He's huge.. And stupid.

16:07.793 --> 16:10.201
That's a baaad combination.

16:11.293 --> 16:13.331
You're right..
He's gonna kill you.

16:14.526 --> 16:16.423
Hey, can I have your computer?

16:17.548 --> 16:22.605
Oh, I can't fight Buck.
He'll hurt me in so many ways..

16:23.635 --> 16:25.859
What am I gonna do?

16:26.557 --> 16:28.175
I got it!

16:39.744 --> 16:41.838
Uh, hey dude.

16:45.234 --> 16:46.782
Take a break.

16:48.939 --> 16:52.144
How can I help you?
- I need you to make me an expert in karate..

16:52.155 --> 16:53.185
by tomorrow.

16:54.902 --> 16:58.686
Gentlemen! Learn karate..

16:59.036 --> 17:02.051
it takes years of intense training!

17:02.542 --> 17:05.941
Can't you just give 'im a one day crash course?
- No!

17:06.588 --> 17:08.664
Karate is in here..

17:09.092 --> 17:10.737
Not in here.

17:11.747 --> 17:14.009
Sometimes in here..

17:14.909 --> 17:20.921
One time in here, but that was after
I swallowed the box of Funcakes.

17:24.316 --> 17:28.608
What?
Do I have something in my teeth?

17:29.817 --> 17:34.638
No!
Look, I got 48 hours, you gonna teach me karate or what?

17:34.989 --> 17:39.647
I am sorry boys,
I can do nothing for you.

17:39.767 --> 17:41.670
We'll give you 30 bucks cash.

17:41.988 --> 17:44.205
Let the training begin!

18:41.863 --> 18:43.007
Left!

18:44.097 --> 18:45.399
Right!

19:17.330 --> 19:21.022
What's up?
Who's the little girl now?!

19:21.055 --> 19:23.484
I did it! Thanks, thanks!

19:23.542 --> 19:26.581
Not comfortable with the hugging!
- Sorry.

19:27.086 --> 19:30.653
You think he's ready?
- As ready as 30 bucks will get him.

19:32.555 --> 19:37.721
So, you boys like chicken tenders

19:51.732 --> 19:54.312
How ya feel?
- Good, Strong.

19:55.321 --> 19:57.302
Awesome, but don't get overconfident.

19:57.351 --> 20:01.390
This guy is big, tough, and stupid.
So remember the plan.

20:01.401 --> 20:03.826
Right.
Go over it again.

20:04.068 --> 20:06.681
You jab, you kick and you stay away
from him.

20:06.747 --> 20:10.852
Make him keep comin' after you.
Eventually he'll get tired and you'll..

20:11.047 --> 20:12.598
That's my boy.
You ready?

20:12.600 --> 20:14.286
You bet.
- Good..

20:14.421 --> 20:16.039
Here comes Buck.

20:18.351 --> 20:23.836
Hope you have an ambulance standing by.
- Yeah I do, for you!

20:27.310 --> 20:30.846
Talk's cheap.
- 40 Quadlers on the newcomer.

20:32.179 --> 20:34.397
Remember the plan.
- Right.

20:34.414 --> 20:38.580
I jab, I punch, and stay away from him
until he gets tired.

20:38.608 --> 20:41.357
And then he's my little girl.

20:41.453 --> 20:42.578
Do it!

20:44.690 --> 20:48.004
You ready?
- Oh yeah baby, come on..

20:55.768 --> 20:58.580
Come on Tiff.
Let's go get some sorbet.

20:58.899 --> 21:00.656
Oh, Buck.

21:14.596 --> 21:16.291
Where is it?
Where'd you put it?

21:16.561 --> 21:18.379
Thought you weren't ever talkin' to me again.

21:18.629 --> 21:22.985
I have to write my Miss Nancy advice
column. Now where is my dress?

21:24.429 --> 21:26.204
I hid it.

21:26.751 --> 21:30.583
That's it!
You are the worst stepbrother ever!

21:31.006 --> 21:33.077
Harsh.
I'm gonna go make myself a sandwich.

21:34.633 --> 21:40.320
You give me the dress or I will unleash
30 dollars worth o' karate on you!

21:41.880 --> 21:43.933
No.
- Man!

21:44.257 --> 21:46.620
Look, I'm trying to do something nice.

21:46.848 --> 21:49.309
You said yourself you hated
dressing up like a woman.

21:49.418 --> 21:50.069
So?

21:50.104 --> 21:52.634
So you don't need the dress
to give good advice.

21:52.753 --> 21:55.220
I told you I do!
- You don't.

21:55.354 --> 21:57.064
Give me my dress!
- No.

21:57.124 --> 21:58.044
Give me my dress!
- Nope.

21:58.124 --> 21:59.714
Drake!
- Question..

21:59.751 --> 22:03.014
if somebody told you that they had to
wear a dress to give good advice..

22:03.074 --> 22:04.360
what would you say?
- I don't know!

22:04.376 --> 22:05.643
What would you say?!
- Drake, I..

22:05.653 --> 22:08.595
What would you say?!
- I'd say that's ridiculous!

22:08.804 --> 22:12.422
I'd say.. Good advice comes from
the heart and from what's inside you..

22:12.460 --> 22:15.274
not the clothes you wear.
- That's stupid.

22:15.356 --> 22:18.167
It's not stupid.
- Yeah it is, that's stupid advice.

22:18.310 --> 22:19.681
It's good advice!

22:19.972 --> 22:23.069
I'm sorry, what'd you say?
- I said: It's good advice!

22:24.479 --> 22:25.989
Guess what Josh?..

22:26.256 --> 22:29.989
Looks like you just gave some good advice
and I don't see you wearin' any dress.

22:35.950 --> 22:37.462
Holy..

22:39.011 --> 22:41.334
You're right.
- I know.

22:42.635 --> 22:46.788
I gave good advice..
While wearing pants!

22:48.099 --> 22:50.406
Praise be the pants.

22:50.527 --> 22:55.032
I never have to dress like a freakish
man-lady again!

22:55.161 --> 22:57.741
Oh, Drake!
Sorry..

22:57.779 --> 23:00.226
I forgot you're not comfortable with the hugging.

23:00.340 --> 23:01.413
Thanks.

23:03.032 --> 23:04.806
Look, man..

23:06.536 --> 23:10.528
I'm sorry I got you into this whole
thing with Buck an-and the black eye.

23:10.603 --> 23:12.640
It's okay.

23:13.057 --> 23:15.240
I know you didn't mean to.

23:16.764 --> 23:21.794
And listen..
I'm sorry that I said you were a bad stepbrother..

23:23.109 --> 23:24.724
I didn't mean that.

23:26.622 --> 23:28.291
Still friends?

23:29.461 --> 23:32.750
Friends?
No way, man.

23:34.499 --> 23:36.822
We're brothers.

23:39.945 --> 23:42.045
May I?

23:42.276 --> 23:44.422
Hug me, brother!

23:49.681 --> 23:52.009
I can't believe you were going on a date
with a wimp like that.

23:52.044 --> 23:55.777
Oh, I wasn't on a date with him.
I was on a date with hím.

23:57.041 --> 24:00.722
Oh, Buck.. Buck..
It was nothing, you know.. It was..

24:10.451 --> 24:13.038
Is he tired yet?

00:00.500 --> 00:20.000
