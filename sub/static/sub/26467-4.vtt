<i>My name is Barry Allen,
and I am the fastest man alive.</i>

00:06.240 --> 00:09.199
<i>To the outside world, I'm an
ordinary forensic scientist.</i>

00:09.320 --> 00:11.357
<i>But secretly, with the help
of my friends</i>

00:11.440 --> 00:13.033
<i>at S.T.A.R. Labs,</i>

00:13.120 --> 00:15.157
<i>I fight crime and find
other meta-humans like me.</i>

00:15.240 --> 00:17.550
<i>But when my daughter came back
from the future to help,</i>

00:17.640 --> 00:19.871
<i>she changed the present.</i>

00:19.960 --> 00:22.475
<i>And now our world is
more dangerous than ever,</i>

00:22.560 --> 00:24.870

00:25.000 --> 00:28.277

00:28.360 --> 00:29.919
<i>Previously on</i> The Flash...

00:30.000 --> 00:31.753
- Who's Cicada?
<i>- You never catch him.</i>

00:31.840 --> 00:33.069
<i>This is Sherloque.</i>

00:33.160 --> 00:36.039
<i>He's the greatest
detective in all the multiverse.</i>

00:36.120 --> 00:37.474
I'm a detective as well.

00:37.560 --> 00:38.835
I'm here to catch
your killer.

00:38.920 --> 00:41.116
So we're dealing with
a meta-human Jack the Ripper.

00:41.200 --> 00:43.556
<i>In my history, he never
killed Gridlock or Block.</i>

00:43.640 --> 00:45.233
<i>They're completely different
victims.</i>

00:45.320 --> 00:47.676
- He's early.
- Because the timeline changed.

00:47.760 --> 00:49.433
Because of me.

01:03.440 --> 01:05.397
Guys, this is mad crazy!

01:05.480 --> 01:08.996
There are, like,
fireballs in the sky!

01:09.080 --> 01:11.720
Holy...

01:11.840 --> 01:14.753
I'm gonna get a better look.

01:18.040 --> 01:21.477
There he is!
This is gonna be lit.

01:22.320 --> 01:24.073
Wait, there's two of them?

01:24.160 --> 01:26.595
Oh, my God, guys.
What was that?

01:26.680 --> 01:28.672
This is cray!
What is going on right now?

01:28.760 --> 01:30.956
Is the world, like,
ending right now?

01:32.320 --> 01:33.754
Oh, my phone.

01:35.160 --> 01:36.958
You just saved my life.

01:37.040 --> 01:38.554
You are the second speedster

01:38.640 --> 01:40.359

saved the world.

01:40.440 --> 01:44.593

01:44.680 --> 01:46.353

02:36.080 --> 02:38.754
- What are you doing?
- Uh, nothing. Go back to bed.

02:38.840 --> 02:40.336
I'm just making some breakfast.

02:40.360 --> 02:41.476
Like I could go to sleep

02:41.560 --> 02:43.597
after the smell
of Jitters coffee.

02:45.360 --> 02:49.400
So, uh, I see you still know
your way around the kitchen.

02:51.320 --> 02:52.834
What's happening?

02:52.920 --> 02:55.116
- Uh, hey, babe.
- Good morning.

02:55.200 --> 02:56.350
Um, I, um, was thinking

02:56.440 --> 02:59.672
that we could have
breakfast together.

02:59.760 --> 03:01.638
Right?
Like a family.

03:01.720 --> 03:03.518
- I love it.
- Yeah.

03:03.600 --> 03:05.478
Do you... Hi.

03:07.320 --> 03:10.518
- Do you need any help?
- No, no. You guys just sit.

03:12.240 --> 03:14.436
Okay.

03:14.520 --> 03:18.150
What... do we have here?

03:18.240 --> 03:20.311
Well, these are pancakes,
as you can see,

03:20.400 --> 03:23.871
but I made them
into little lightning bolts.

03:23.960 --> 03:26.270
<i>Well, the batter
kind of got away from me,</i>

03:26.360 --> 03:27.999
but you see
the little zigzag...

03:28.080 --> 03:30.311
No, no, no. Yeah, yeah.
I totally see it, yeah.

03:30.400 --> 03:32.278
<i>Yeah.</i>

03:32.360 --> 03:34.520
What are... what are you doing?

03:34.600 --> 03:36.398
Uh, I am
just getting evidence

03:36.480 --> 03:39.917
that you make lumpy pancakes
in every time period.

03:40.000 --> 03:42.879
Let's try it out.

03:46.320 --> 03:49.233
Mmm. Lumpy, but delicious.

03:49.320 --> 03:51.471
- Yeah? Oh, thanks, babe.
- Oh.

03:53.600 --> 03:57.037
I'm sorry, um, when did you...
when did you get a phone?

03:57.120 --> 03:59.351
Uh, Dad got it for me
a couple days ago.

03:59.440 --> 04:00.874
Mm-hmm.

04:05.240 --> 04:07.800
Nora suggested it. I mean,
I thought it was a great idea.

04:07.880 --> 04:10.031
We're always in and out
of S.T.A.R. Labs, so I just...

04:10.120 --> 04:12.760
you know, it'd be easier
to text and call.

04:12.840 --> 04:14.513
Yeah.

04:14.600 --> 04:17.069
Yeah, that totally
makes sense.

04:18.600 --> 04:20.079
You guys excited
to cheer me on

04:20.160 --> 04:21.560
at the charity softball game?

04:21.640 --> 04:24.439
Softball, schway.

04:24.520 --> 04:26.910
I just hope I don't get
stuck in right field this year.

04:30.160 --> 04:31.992
You, uh, gave
your number out already?

04:32.080 --> 04:34.879
Yeah, just to the team
and Sherloque.

04:35.000 --> 04:38.038
Actually, this text message,
I think, is from him.

04:38.120 --> 04:41.830
I don't think
he's much of a texter.

04:41.920 --> 04:43.274
No.

04:43.360 --> 04:45.556
He, uh, wants us to come
to S.T.A.R. Labs.

04:45.680 --> 04:47.160
I'm gonna go get ready.

04:47.240 --> 04:48.913
You haven't had anything
to eat yet.

04:49.000 --> 04:51.640
Mm. I'm not really
a breakfast person.

04:56.680 --> 04:59.240
You know,
I thought having her here,

04:59.360 --> 05:00.936
we would finally
have a chance to connect,

05:00.960 --> 05:03.156
but it's like every time
we take a half-step forward,

05:03.280 --> 05:05.397
we end up taking
six steps back.

05:05.480 --> 05:07.790
I-I mean, don't give up.
She'll come around.

05:07.880 --> 05:09.678
I have a feeling.
Yeah.

05:12.240 --> 05:14.630
Well, not if I keep
making food like that.

05:14.720 --> 05:16.313
Hey, no, this really is good.

05:16.400 --> 05:18.676
It is. I mean,
it's a little, like...

05:18.760 --> 05:21.000
- Wait, wait, stop. Just stop.
- Dark, but... No, it's...

05:21.080 --> 05:22.833
I'm going to make you
a banana. It's fine.

05:22.920 --> 05:24.096
You're going
to make me a banana?

05:24.120 --> 05:26.077
I'm going to make you
a banana.

05:26.160 --> 05:27.992
Thanks.

05:30.040 --> 05:32.396
Wait, no,
I asked for everyone.

05:32.480 --> 05:36.394
Where is the little, uh...

05:36.520 --> 05:38.432
Cisco is laying low
at his parents' house

05:38.520 --> 05:40.432
while he heals up.

05:40.520 --> 05:43.399
Well, that's not very brave
on his part.

05:43.480 --> 05:46.791
I will have a conversation
with him next time I see him.

05:46.880 --> 05:48.758
So, Team Flash.

05:48.840 --> 05:51.036
How will this handsome,
master detective

05:51.160 --> 05:52.992
of all the multiverse,
Sherloque Wells,

05:53.120 --> 05:56.431
pay off his debt to us...

05:56.520 --> 06:01.754
and catch this
homicidal maniac together?

06:01.880 --> 06:03.296
Well, we'll begin
by asking ourselves

06:03.320 --> 06:04.436
a few obvious questions.

06:04.520 --> 06:06.398
How he became a meta-human?

06:06.480 --> 06:07.880
Well,
power manifestation varies.

06:07.960 --> 06:09.599
The particle accelerator...

06:09.720 --> 06:11.376
I don't think we're
interrupting Sherloque, right?

06:11.400 --> 06:12.880
- Right.
- Sure, but you bring up

06:12.960 --> 06:14.360
a good point, Dr. Snow.

06:14.440 --> 06:16.557
What do we know so far
about this Cicada?

06:16.640 --> 06:18.632
Well, we know that
he's killed two people

06:18.720 --> 06:20.871
and almost a third.

06:20.960 --> 06:23.077
Exactly right.
If I could gently be

06:23.160 --> 06:25.994
a little more specific,
not just people, right?

06:26.080 --> 06:27.833
Meta-humans.

06:27.920 --> 06:30.310
Also, Joe said he got the
feeling that Cicada's a dad.

06:30.400 --> 06:33.438
Right. Cicada... parent.

06:33.520 --> 06:35.591
His dagger dampens powers.

06:35.680 --> 06:37.273
Not just dampens
the powers, right?

06:37.360 --> 06:38.840
He commands this dagger, right?

06:38.960 --> 06:40.474
It is like
an extension of himself.

06:40.560 --> 06:42.233
So we know...

06:42.320 --> 06:44.176
Maybe they acquired
their powers at the same time.

06:44.200 --> 06:46.271
Yes, very good, Dr. Snow.

06:46.360 --> 06:49.910
So, acquired powers...

06:50.000 --> 06:51.673
<i>together.</i>

06:51.760 --> 06:52.989
<i>So...</i>

06:53.080 --> 06:55.436
there we are, Team Flash.

06:55.560 --> 06:57.791
Very simple.

06:57.880 --> 06:59.678
We unravel this puzzle,

06:59.760 --> 07:04.118
and we have a pathway
to tracking Cicada.

07:04.200 --> 07:07.193
Cool, or we just answer
a much more basic question,

07:07.320 --> 07:11.075
like what's up
with his weird mask?

07:11.200 --> 07:15.319
Well, the mask conceals
his identity.

07:15.400 --> 07:16.993
- That's what it's for.
- Right.

07:17.120 --> 07:18.270
What I'm suggesting is,

07:18.360 --> 07:20.238
if we find out what
the mask is for,

07:20.320 --> 07:22.152
we'll find out the man
underneath much faster.

07:22.240 --> 07:24.960
37 times I have caught
Cicada, right?

07:25.040 --> 07:28.556
And not once was this mask
angle very useful, right?

07:28.640 --> 07:30.552
But you know what?

07:30.640 --> 07:33.235
The more hours I bill you,
the less money I owe you.

07:33.320 --> 07:35.256
So, if you want to spend your
hours pursuing the mask angle,

07:35.280 --> 07:37.397
well, then be my guest.

07:39.040 --> 07:40.838
Okay, great.
Sounds like a plan.

07:40.920 --> 07:42.639
- We got to get going.
- Yeah, yes.

07:42.720 --> 07:43.870
Good stuff.

07:43.960 --> 07:47.078
I hope you score a touchdown.

07:47.160 --> 07:50.119
- It's softball.
- Ah, score a basket.

07:50.200 --> 07:52.669
So, baby giraffe...

07:52.760 --> 07:55.229
lead on, my friend.

07:55.320 --> 07:57.676
Wow.

07:57.760 --> 07:59.080
Look at these guys.

07:59.160 --> 08:02.676
They think they're
so much better than us.

08:02.760 --> 08:04.479
Because they are, Bar.

08:04.560 --> 08:07.029
I mean, without Captain Singh
or my dad, it's...

08:07.120 --> 08:08.634
Huh.

08:08.720 --> 08:12.316
- Huh, what?
- Jonesy isn't here yet.

08:12.400 --> 08:14.119
Hey, Detective Rowell,
what do you think?

08:14.200 --> 08:16.351
- Maybe third base for me?
- Right field, Allen.

08:16.440 --> 08:18.511
Babe, I love you,
but leave the hot corner

08:18.640 --> 08:20.757
to someone who can actually
field a ball, okay?

08:20.840 --> 08:22.115
<i>- Play ball!</i>
- Come on.

08:22.200 --> 08:24.999
- I mean... Good luck!
- Yeah.

08:25.080 --> 08:28.869
- You're going to nail it.
- Right field.

08:28.960 --> 08:32.158
- Oh, God.
- In right field.

08:32.280 --> 08:35.830
Not the hot corner, but...

the stories

09:08.720 --> 09:11.030
about what an awful athlete
Dad was growing up.

09:11.120 --> 09:12.679
Well, believe me,
they're true.

09:12.760 --> 09:14.638
Let's just be grateful
that he has coordination

09:14.720 --> 09:16.552
- when it counts.
- Yeah.

09:16.640 --> 09:18.950
Hey, what is that, Nora?

09:19.040 --> 09:21.680
You know, it's this really great
app called Spyn Zone.

09:21.760 --> 09:23.560
The push notifications
let you know the second

09:23.640 --> 09:25.438
anything happens in the city.

09:25.520 --> 09:27.034
Like Iris' Website?

09:27.120 --> 09:28.793
Uh, yeah, kind of.

09:28.920 --> 09:30.593
It's just a lot more
up to date than that,

09:30.680 --> 09:32.239
and it's, like...
it's really cool.

09:32.320 --> 09:35.518
This girl's, like,
really in the know.

09:35.600 --> 09:37.239
<i>Oh.</i>

09:37.320 --> 09:39.312
Yeah, Spencer Young.
I know her.

09:39.400 --> 09:40.520
Yeah, I see her all the time

09:40.640 --> 09:42.040
working on her laptop
at Jitters.

09:42.120 --> 09:44.271
She... she actually was
a junior reporter at CCPN

09:44.360 --> 09:45.760
when I worked there,
but...

09:45.840 --> 09:47.320
she didn't last very long.

09:47.440 --> 09:49.557
- Why not?
- Well, she wanted to be famous

09:49.640 --> 09:50.994
and make a name for herself,

09:51.080 --> 09:52.296
but she didn't care
how it happened.

09:52.320 --> 09:53.959
Well, I think she's cute.

09:54.040 --> 09:55.599
Yeah, I mean,
she may be cute,

09:55.680 --> 09:57.876
but she's never fact-checked
a thing a day in her life.

09:57.960 --> 09:59.416
She's doing something right...
she has three times

09:59.440 --> 10:02.638
as many followers on her app
as you do on your blog, so...

10:02.720 --> 10:06.236
I'm going to get something
to eat.

10:06.320 --> 10:08.232
- Ooh
- Wow.

10:09.720 --> 10:13.077
<i>- Ah, come on, Allen!</i>
- Oh, honey.

10:13.160 --> 10:14.196
Oh.

10:27.000 --> 10:30.072
- Cecile? What's wrong?
- Something's not right.

10:30.160 --> 10:31.310
Something's not right.

10:34.880 --> 10:36.917
Is that Jonesy?

10:37.000 --> 10:39.879
Hey, somebody stop him!

10:39.960 --> 10:41.872
Everybody move!

10:55.920 --> 10:58.515
<i>Hey, hey!</i>

10:58.600 --> 11:00.990
- Nora, hey.
- Huh? What?

11:01.080 --> 11:02.753
What happened?

11:02.840 --> 11:04.593
You just saved everybody.

11:24.800 --> 11:26.120
Bomb squad finished
their sweep.

11:26.200 --> 11:28.112
- They said it's all clear.
- Okay.

11:28.200 --> 11:30.351
Nora, how did you know
what was happening?

11:30.440 --> 11:32.909
I don't know.

11:33.000 --> 11:34.514
One minute I was going
to get food,

11:34.600 --> 11:37.035
and the next I was
in the outfield with Dad.

11:37.120 --> 11:38.560
And you don't remember
anything else?

11:42.120 --> 11:44.077
What's that?

11:44.160 --> 11:46.311
A notification
from Spyn Zone.

11:48.080 --> 11:50.834
Already? That was fast.

11:50.920 --> 11:52.593
Allen, CSI time.

11:52.680 --> 11:54.751
Uh, we're up. We'll meet you
back at S.T.A.R. Labs

11:54.840 --> 11:57.196
- as soon as we can.
- Yeah.

11:57.280 --> 12:00.637
Iris,
if Cicada sees that post...

12:00.720 --> 12:04.236
Yeah, he may pick Nora
as his next target.

12:11.040 --> 12:15.080
Well, you have brought us
to the location

12:15.160 --> 12:16.958
you first encountered
Cicada.

12:17.040 --> 12:18.554
That's right.
How did you know that?

12:18.640 --> 12:20.256
I know everything.
I'm a master detective.

12:20.280 --> 12:22.056
Look, I looked at
the CSI file of Barry Allen.

12:22.080 --> 12:24.834
There is no evidence
of Cicada DNA, right?

12:24.920 --> 12:27.116
And moreover,
look at this location, right?

12:27.200 --> 12:28.336
All the traffic through here...

12:28.360 --> 12:30.192
you can never pull DNA
from here.

12:30.280 --> 12:31.536
It's a good thing
we're not here for DNA.

12:31.560 --> 12:32.789
What we are here for, then?

12:32.880 --> 12:35.236
We're here to find out
why Cicada wears that mask.

12:35.320 --> 12:36.959
Oh, <i>encore</i> with the mask!

12:37.040 --> 12:38.600
Do you think he's allergic
to fresh air?

12:38.680 --> 12:40.717
- No.
- No, he wears that mask

12:40.800 --> 12:41.916
for a reason.

12:42.000 --> 12:44.515
All right, look, 37 times
I've caught Cicada.

12:44.600 --> 12:46.432
Not once, not one time
was the mask

12:46.520 --> 12:48.480
- a key part of the evidence.
- Yeah, that's true.

12:48.520 --> 12:50.496
But you said this Cicada is
different than all the others,

12:50.520 --> 12:52.671
so why wouldn't his mask
be different, too?

12:52.760 --> 12:55.150
Maybe it's just a mask to...
You know what?

12:55.240 --> 12:56.960
You want to pursuit mask angle,
be my guest.

12:57.040 --> 12:58.918
What do you expect
to find here?

12:59.000 --> 13:01.151
When I was getting
my ass kicked,

13:01.240 --> 13:02.816
I noticed that the more
he exerted himself,

13:02.840 --> 13:04.354
the heavier his breathing got.

13:04.440 --> 13:06.193
- That's what happens.
- So, I thought...

13:06.280 --> 13:08.840
if one of those breaths
was strong enough...

13:08.920 --> 13:11.719
We might just get lucky.

13:11.800 --> 13:13.837
How we are going
to get lucky?

13:13.920 --> 13:16.037
Barry found traces
of fluoropolymers here.

13:16.120 --> 13:17.713
- So?
- So the Internet told me

13:17.800 --> 13:19.029
they're prone to flaking.

13:19.120 --> 13:21.351
I'm here to get some of them.

13:21.440 --> 13:23.416
The Internet also tell you to
contaminate your crime scene?

13:23.440 --> 13:24.954
Very good,
master detective.

13:26.720 --> 13:28.677
Turns out
industrial respirators use

13:28.760 --> 13:30.136
a protective coating
around the nostrils

13:30.160 --> 13:31.514
that are made from this.

13:31.600 --> 13:32.936
And when this exposed
to another compound,

13:32.960 --> 13:35.350
dimethyl sulfate,
fluoropolymers tend to emit

13:35.440 --> 13:36.590
a very distinct odor.

13:36.680 --> 13:37.830
Burnt onions.

13:37.960 --> 13:40.429
Right.

13:42.720 --> 13:44.837
We find out
where this is used,

13:44.920 --> 13:46.877
we're going to find our man.

13:46.960 --> 13:49.077
- Elementary.
- Elementary.

13:49.160 --> 13:51.152
No shrap, Sherlock.

13:54.960 --> 13:56.917
It's Sherloque.

14:04.320 --> 14:06.277
Spencer?

14:06.360 --> 14:08.033
Iris West, wow.

14:08.120 --> 14:09.839
Long time.
How are you?

14:09.920 --> 14:11.991
Uh, yeah, yeah,
I'm good. And you?

14:12.120 --> 14:15.079
Good. Married that CSI guy
you were dating, huh?

14:15.160 --> 14:16.389
Uh, yeah.

14:16.480 --> 14:19.518
- Any kids yet?
- Um, no. Not...

14:19.600 --> 14:21.319
Uh...

14:21.400 --> 14:22.675
No.

14:22.760 --> 14:24.513
You know,
I followed your lead.

14:24.600 --> 14:26.671
Started my own blog,
left CCPN.

14:26.800 --> 14:28.951
Now we are both
Charleine Foster Kanes.

14:29.040 --> 14:30.394
Right.

14:30.480 --> 14:32.676
BTdubs, those Professor DeVoe
stories... respect.

14:32.760 --> 14:34.752
Metas are clickbait
right now, right?

14:34.840 --> 14:37.833
Yes, which is why I wanted
to talk to you, actually,

14:37.920 --> 14:39.070
off the record,
of course.

14:39.160 --> 14:40.560
Yeah, for sure.
What's up?

14:40.640 --> 14:43.599
So, uh, I recently found
a source who thinks

14:43.680 --> 14:45.592
that metas
are being targeted.

14:45.680 --> 14:47.592
Ooh, juicy.
Who?

14:47.680 --> 14:50.673
Well, no one knows,
not even CCPD.

14:50.760 --> 14:52.240
But these metas,
including speedsters

14:52.320 --> 14:55.711
like The Flash and XS,
they are all in danger.

14:55.800 --> 15:00.033
XS. That new lady speedster
has a code name.

15:00.120 --> 15:02.635
Oh, like her size!

15:02.720 --> 15:04.598
Right, extra small.

15:04.680 --> 15:07.354
- Did you coin that?
- No, no.

15:07.440 --> 15:10.558
Look, the point is,
writing articles about XS

15:10.640 --> 15:12.199
could make her a target.

15:12.280 --> 15:13.919
Or it could make her famous.

15:14.000 --> 15:16.151
I mean, people are already
obsessed with her...

15:16.240 --> 15:17.560
and my app even more.

15:17.640 --> 15:20.155
Besides, a little threat
never stopped you

15:20.240 --> 15:23.119
from writing about
The Flash back in the day.

15:23.200 --> 15:24.714
That was different.

15:24.800 --> 15:29.511
Because it was <i>your</i> blog?
What... do as I say, not as I do?

15:29.600 --> 15:32.115
Look, please stop, okay?
Before someone gets hurt.

15:32.240 --> 15:34.880
The only one who's going
to get hurt is you

15:34.960 --> 15:37.350
when I make
your blog irrelevant.

15:41.840 --> 15:44.196
<i>What is this for, Allen?</i>

15:44.280 --> 15:47.432
Just trying to get
some answers, Jonesy.

15:47.520 --> 15:49.159
Would you send that to Caitlin?

15:49.240 --> 15:51.709
I told everyone everything
I know, which is nothing.

15:51.800 --> 15:54.520
- You don't remember a thing?
- No.

15:54.640 --> 15:59.396
Okay, God's own truth, Allen...
all I remember is waking up,

15:59.520 --> 16:01.512
getting ready for the game,
leaving my house,

16:01.600 --> 16:04.672
and the next thing I know,
I wake up in the field

16:04.760 --> 16:06.638
after that bomb went off.

16:06.720 --> 16:09.633
I mean, where would
I even get a bomb?

16:09.720 --> 16:10.949
<i>The evidence lockup.</i>

16:12.240 --> 16:13.833
It was part of
the inventory we seized

16:13.920 --> 16:15.479
from the Jansen-Moretti case.

16:15.560 --> 16:18.837
The cameras in the lockup
show you stuffing that bomb

16:18.920 --> 16:21.560
in your backpack this morning.

16:24.360 --> 16:27.319
- Joe, no one got hurt.
- They could've.

16:27.400 --> 16:31.030
The woman I love, my baby...
you could've killed them.

16:34.160 --> 16:36.720
I watched you come up, man.

16:36.800 --> 16:39.360
I'm sorry, Joe...

16:39.440 --> 16:42.672
but I swear, I don't know
how this happened.

16:45.040 --> 16:48.397
Move, move!

16:48.480 --> 16:51.200
- How many we got?
- Hey, what is it?

16:51.320 --> 16:54.757
Fire at CCPN. First
responders are across town.

16:54.840 --> 16:56.593
We got to go.

17:07.280 --> 17:08.430
Finally.

17:08.520 --> 17:10.318
Okay, the building's
already been evacuated.

17:10.400 --> 17:11.720
Fire trucks are on their way.

17:11.839 --> 17:13.911
Okay, let's just get inside
and put the fire out.

17:14.000 --> 17:15.719
I've never done this before.

17:15.800 --> 17:18.234
Come on.
Seriously, move!

17:18.319 --> 17:20.240
That's okay. We're just going
to create a vacuum.

17:23.000 --> 17:25.390
Fine.
I will make you move.

17:25.520 --> 17:28.240
Enjoy this news, Flash.

17:31.760 --> 17:33.896
All right, I'll walk you
through it. Once we're inside...

17:36.560 --> 17:39.632
What? Where...
where are you going?

17:39.720 --> 17:40.720
Nora, what's wrong?

17:40.800 --> 17:43.235
He just ran away and left.

17:43.320 --> 17:46.518
His suit's GPS
has him west, way west.

17:46.600 --> 17:48.910
Barry? Barry.

17:50.320 --> 17:51.674
He's not listening.

17:51.760 --> 17:54.798
Uh, guys,
what do I do here?

17:54.880 --> 17:56.936
Okay, Nora, you're going
to have to do this by yourself.

17:56.960 --> 17:58.314
Okay? But I'm going
to help you.

17:58.400 --> 17:59.914
Okay.

18:00.000 --> 18:01.696
Okay, you need to get
to the heart of the fire

18:01.720 --> 18:04.360
and extinguish it from there.

18:04.440 --> 18:06.159
- I got it.
<i>- Rotate your arms</i>

18:06.240 --> 18:08.118
in tight circles.

18:08.200 --> 18:09.696
You need to move them
in opposite directions,

18:09.720 --> 18:11.120
creating twin vacuums.

18:11.200 --> 18:13.556
Come on, Nora.

18:13.640 --> 18:15.711
Dad's done this
a thousand times.

18:15.800 --> 18:17.280
You can do this.

18:23.120 --> 18:24.634
I'm doing it!

18:24.720 --> 18:26.518
Keep going.

18:38.760 --> 18:41.355
Whoa.

18:47.880 --> 18:50.520
Great job, Nora.

18:50.600 --> 18:52.319
Thanks, Mom.

18:55.520 --> 18:58.558
Hey... hey, did you find Dad?

19:06.360 --> 19:09.034
What the hell?

19:17.040 --> 19:18.838
I'm glad you were there
to put that out.

19:18.920 --> 19:20.720
- It could've been a lot worse.
- Thanks, Dad.

19:20.800 --> 19:24.476
Don't thank me. Your mom
walked you through it.

19:24.600 --> 19:27.638
You were really great
out there.

19:27.720 --> 19:30.872
So there was some
weird activity with your scan,

19:30.960 --> 19:33.680
but everything looks fine.

19:33.760 --> 19:34.910
Hmm.

19:35.000 --> 19:36.719
What's the last thing
you remember?

19:36.800 --> 19:38.951
Standing outside
CCPN with Nora.

19:39.040 --> 19:40.838
Next thing I know,
I'm in Vegas.

19:40.920 --> 19:43.719
That's exactly what happened
to me and Officer Jones.

19:43.800 --> 19:45.154
So maybe
the abnormal activity

19:45.240 --> 19:47.391
was some sort
of hypnotic induction?

19:47.480 --> 19:49.136
I don't know. I mean,
I feel like one of us

19:49.160 --> 19:50.856
would've noticed somebody
trying to hypnotize me.

19:50.880 --> 19:53.080
Yeah, and why would someone
hypnotize us to save people?

19:53.120 --> 19:55.316
Publicity.

19:55.400 --> 19:58.040
Spencer Young wants to get
famous by making you famous.

19:58.120 --> 19:59.236
You don't know that.

19:59.320 --> 20:00.834
She admitted it
when we talked.

20:00.920 --> 20:02.798
Why would you go talk to her?

20:05.000 --> 20:07.276
Hold on, look at
the timestamp on the post.

20:07.360 --> 20:10.671
7:52 p.m.? Nora and I were
still with Jonesy,

20:10.760 --> 20:13.229
and the fire at CCPN
hadn't even been reported yet.

20:13.320 --> 20:15.096
I guess you'll always be
the first one to the scoop

20:15.120 --> 20:16.634
if you're the one making it.

20:16.720 --> 20:18.837
So she's some sort
of early edition meta

20:18.920 --> 20:19.990
who creates stories?

20:20.080 --> 20:22.356
Fake news taken
to a whole new level.

20:22.440 --> 20:24.318
Maybe she's some kind
of meta psychic

20:24.400 --> 20:25.880
who predicts the news.

20:25.960 --> 20:27.997
That still doesn't mean
she hypnotized us.

20:28.120 --> 20:29.952
Yeah.

20:30.080 --> 20:32.197
Caitlin, can you download
the cortical biometrics

20:32.280 --> 20:34.511
from Nora's suit and run it
against my scans?

20:34.600 --> 20:36.478
On it.
Thanks.

20:36.560 --> 20:38.950
What are you thinking?

20:39.040 --> 20:41.635
We need to figure out if
Spencer's responsible for this.

20:54.040 --> 20:55.793
Google for the win
on finding out

20:55.880 --> 20:57.896
- where Cicada's mask is from.
- Google for the win.

20:57.920 --> 20:59.593
So you think
Cicada's hiding out here,

20:59.680 --> 21:01.160
just lurking behind
those doors.

21:01.280 --> 21:02.520
Yeah, as a matter
of fact, I do,

21:02.560 --> 21:04.416
because my search also told me
that Szrek Chemicals

21:04.440 --> 21:06.909
uses dimethyl sulfates
in most of their products.

21:07.000 --> 21:10.471
So guess what?
I'm gonna take down Cicada.

21:10.560 --> 21:12.438
Oh, well, we shall see,
giraffe.

21:14.760 --> 21:16.513
May I help you?

21:16.600 --> 21:19.752
- Hi, how are you? I'm...
- Elongated Man. I know.

21:19.880 --> 21:22.634
Sherloque Wells, yes,
master detective.

21:22.720 --> 21:25.200
You know, we'll sign autographs
later... we have some business.

21:25.240 --> 21:27.072
Uh, we just want to know
if we can ask you

21:27.160 --> 21:28.389
some questions, please.

21:28.480 --> 21:29.630
About?

21:36.160 --> 21:38.038
What about our masks?

21:38.120 --> 21:40.032
Do any of your employees
wear them?

21:43.680 --> 21:44.680
Follow me.

22:01.920 --> 22:05.755
Yep. Every worker,
every plant wears one.

22:05.840 --> 22:07.320
How many plants?

22:07.400 --> 22:09.119
Three in Central City
and Keystone.

22:09.200 --> 22:12.511
- Mm.
<i>- 14 in the Midwest alone.</i>

22:12.640 --> 22:14.950
So probably thousands?

22:15.040 --> 22:18.238
Yeah, and we aren't the only
facility that uses them.

22:20.760 --> 22:21.955
Thank you for your time.

22:22.040 --> 22:23.793
Hey, I, uh...

22:23.880 --> 22:26.679
Love that pear meme going
around the last few weeks.

22:26.760 --> 22:30.470
Classic.

22:30.560 --> 22:33.359
Mm, classic.
I have a suggestion for you.

22:33.440 --> 22:35.591
Maybe the next time you do
a Google search,

22:35.680 --> 22:37.672
advance to page two.

22:37.760 --> 22:39.035
Hmm?

22:59.840 --> 23:01.672
<i>So here's the meta-watch.</i>

23:01.760 --> 23:05.879
Press that button. If Spencer's
a meta, it'll beep.

23:05.960 --> 23:07.758
And if she's meta...

23:07.840 --> 23:09.816
It means she could be
dangerous, so come right back.

23:09.840 --> 23:12.275
Yes. One of us
would go with you,

23:12.360 --> 23:14.670
but she knows both me
and your dad, so...

23:14.760 --> 23:16.319
I got it.

23:16.400 --> 23:18.312
Okay, we're here
if you need us, all ri...

23:18.400 --> 23:20.869
Um...

23:23.040 --> 23:25.032
I see her.

23:25.120 --> 23:26.936
All you need to do is get
within five feet of her,

23:26.960 --> 23:28.235
<i>hit the button,
in and out.</i>

23:28.320 --> 23:30.357
I know!

23:30.440 --> 23:32.033
You see what I mean?

23:33.720 --> 23:35.996
Half-step forward,
six steps back?

23:36.080 --> 23:38.914
I mean, you guys did great
with the fire, though.

23:39.000 --> 23:41.196
Thank you.

23:41.280 --> 23:43.317
You should totally name
one of your drinks

23:43.440 --> 23:45.830
after that new female
speedster, XS.

23:45.920 --> 23:47.991
- Hey.
- Whoa. Hi.

23:48.080 --> 23:49.400
Hi.
Sorry, Spencer.

23:49.480 --> 23:52.314
That's okay.
Do I know you?

23:52.400 --> 23:54.869
- Uh-oh.
- Uh, Nora...

23:54.960 --> 23:56.553
<i>you have to press the button.</i>

23:56.640 --> 23:59.474
Um, no.
No, you don't know me.

23:59.560 --> 24:01.279
- But you know me.
- Yes, I do.

24:01.360 --> 24:03.511
Uh, sorry.
You're Spencer Young.

24:03.600 --> 24:05.592
I read all your stuff
on Spyn Zone.

24:05.680 --> 24:07.160
It's a really good app.

24:07.240 --> 24:09.118
It's fantastic stories
and really good writing.

24:09.200 --> 24:10.600
I'm a... I'm a really big fan.

24:10.680 --> 24:12.911
<i>- Nora..</i>
- I always enjoy meeting a fan.

24:15.360 --> 24:18.273
Especially when they're
as adorable as you.

24:18.360 --> 24:20.113
What's happening?

24:20.200 --> 24:23.079
She's flirting with
our daughter. I'll be back.

24:24.320 --> 24:26.118
What?
Hold down the fort.

24:26.200 --> 24:27.998
Iris, wait.

24:30.480 --> 24:31.480
Huh.

24:32.560 --> 24:37.112
- Do you have a name?
- Nora, hey.

24:37.200 --> 24:40.511
- Wait, y-you know her?
- Uh, I do.

24:40.600 --> 24:42.512
Well, she's actually...

24:42.600 --> 24:44.751
This is, actually...

24:44.840 --> 24:48.550
Did you want
to check your watch?

24:48.640 --> 24:51.553
I think we're running
a little bit late.

24:51.640 --> 24:54.872
- Right, yes. Mm-hmm.
- Yeah.

24:56.800 --> 24:59.031
All right, well,
I'm going to peace out.

25:01.560 --> 25:04.997
But I hope to meet
cute you again sometime.

25:07.000 --> 25:08.116
Nora.

25:10.560 --> 25:12.358
Well, I guess
she's not meta.

25:12.440 --> 25:14.636
I guess not.

25:18.200 --> 25:20.112
Oh, no. No, no, no.

25:20.200 --> 25:22.760
Nora... look, I don't care
that you think she's cute.

25:22.840 --> 25:26.754
She's dangerous, okay?
You need to stay away from her.

25:26.840 --> 25:28.752
She <i>could</i> be dangerous.

25:28.880 --> 25:31.600
Nora, I am trying
to protect you here.

25:31.680 --> 25:34.434
Has that been
your thing my whole life?

25:34.520 --> 25:37.354
What does that even mean,
honestly?

25:37.440 --> 25:39.397
I mean, is that why
you've been so cold to me,

25:39.480 --> 25:41.240
why you don't want
to spend any time with me?

25:41.280 --> 25:43.272
I'm... I'm just trying
to get to know you.

25:43.360 --> 25:46.194
- Just drop it.
- Nora, I don't under...

25:46.280 --> 25:48.397
Look, you lied to me!

25:48.480 --> 25:51.234
I would never lie to you.

25:51.360 --> 25:54.159
Yeah?
What do you call that?

25:57.280 --> 26:00.000
You put a power-dampening chip
inside me

26:00.120 --> 26:01.474
to take away my speed.

26:01.560 --> 26:02.789
And until six months ago,

26:02.880 --> 26:04.758
I didn't even know
I had powers.

26:04.840 --> 26:06.832
My whole life has been a lie

26:06.960 --> 26:08.616
because you have been trying
to protect me.

26:08.640 --> 26:12.031
Well, guess what?
I don't need you to do that.

26:26.080 --> 26:28.197
- Hey.
- Hey.

26:28.280 --> 26:30.840
- What you doing?
- Well, Nora blocked me.

26:30.920 --> 26:32.798
So I'm trying to use
the quantum computer

26:32.880 --> 26:36.351
to access her phone and
force her to accept my calls.

26:36.440 --> 26:37.920
But I am no...

26:38.000 --> 26:40.469
hacker.

26:40.560 --> 26:41.936
Don't you think that's
a little extreme?

26:41.960 --> 26:43.758
Yes, Barry,
it's very extreme...

26:43.840 --> 26:47.072
and crazy and desperate, but
I am feeling extremely crazy

26:47.160 --> 26:49.072
and desperate, okay?

26:49.160 --> 26:52.153
I thought giving her
space would, you know,

26:52.240 --> 26:53.640
have her eventually
come around,

26:53.720 --> 26:56.474
but it turns out
she's not the problem. I am.

26:56.560 --> 26:58.517
I mean, I don't know how
I could do something

26:58.600 --> 27:00.273
like that to her, Barry.

27:00.360 --> 27:02.033
Iris, you didn't do anything
to her.

27:02.120 --> 27:05.033
You can't blame yourself for
something future-you might do.

27:05.120 --> 27:07.271
Yes, I can, Barry,
and it's not a might.

27:07.360 --> 27:10.671
I suppressed
our daughter's powers.

27:10.760 --> 27:13.229
I kept a huge part
of who she was a secret

27:13.360 --> 27:14.360
for her entire life.

27:14.440 --> 27:16.079
I did that.

27:16.160 --> 27:17.913
Look, she'll forgive you.

27:18.000 --> 27:19.878
What if my dad did something
like that to you

27:19.960 --> 27:22.759
after the particle accelerator
exploded?

27:22.840 --> 27:24.672
See?

27:24.760 --> 27:28.993
I don't understand how I could
do something like that to her.

27:29.080 --> 27:31.754
Look, I don't know
why you do it,

27:31.840 --> 27:34.150
but I don't need to.

27:34.240 --> 27:37.472
I know that anything you do for
our family, it's out of love.

27:37.560 --> 27:40.234
So, whatever reason future-you
has for doing this,

27:40.320 --> 27:42.551
I have faith that it's
the right thing to do,

27:42.680 --> 27:44.831
and so should you.

27:44.920 --> 27:46.639
Yeah, well, I'm having
a really hard time

27:46.720 --> 27:48.279
believing that.

27:48.360 --> 27:51.319
Well, then it's a good thing
I have enough faith in you

27:51.400 --> 27:52.993
for the both of us.

27:53.080 --> 27:54.912
All right?

27:59.440 --> 28:02.239
That's unusual.

28:04.600 --> 28:06.717
<i>Dr. Snow.</i>

28:06.800 --> 28:08.314
Aah!

28:08.400 --> 28:09.629
Oh, Dr. Snow.

28:09.720 --> 28:11.518
I have frightened you,
Dr. Snow.

28:11.600 --> 28:13.910
I assume you came here
for some other reason

28:14.000 --> 28:15.036
than murdering me?

28:15.120 --> 28:17.396
Oof...

28:17.480 --> 28:19.039
If I was to murder you,
Dr. Snow,

28:19.120 --> 28:21.157
I would not do it in such
an obvious fashion.

28:21.240 --> 28:25.154
Look, I have a theory
on the identity of Cicada.

28:25.240 --> 28:26.959
I request your assistance.

28:27.040 --> 28:30.272
Uh, okay.
I was just finishing up.

28:30.360 --> 28:32.397
Not your expertise,
your assistance.

28:32.520 --> 28:35.319
I need you to punch me
in the chest.

28:35.440 --> 28:36.794
What?

28:36.880 --> 28:39.475
Right here, above the... um,
dee-aphragm. How do you say?

28:39.560 --> 28:40.676
Diaphragm?

28:40.760 --> 28:41.830
Diaphragm, right.

28:41.920 --> 28:44.389
In the solar plexus
as hard as you can. <i>Allé.</i>

28:44.480 --> 28:46.278
Listen, Sherlock...

28:46.360 --> 28:47.635
- Ugh.
- Loque.

28:47.720 --> 28:49.712
So this is one of those things

28:49.800 --> 28:52.520
where you are just the brains
and not the brawn?

28:52.600 --> 28:54.831
You don't have the guts.
You lack the courage.

28:54.960 --> 28:55.960
You're soft.

28:56.040 --> 28:58.714
Probably you couldn't even
hit me in the spot.

29:00.560 --> 29:02.916
For the record,
I know what you just did.

29:03.000 --> 29:04.912
- And?
- And it worked.

29:05.000 --> 29:08.152
<i>Très bien.</i>
Then... <i>allé.</i>

29:09.960 --> 29:11.713
Ooh!

29:15.080 --> 29:17.549
Oh, uh, are you okay?

29:26.400 --> 29:28.596
You sound just like...

29:30.600 --> 29:32.717
Cicada.

29:34.840 --> 29:36.593
<i>What do we got?</i>

29:36.680 --> 29:38.637
CCPD is getting bombarded
with calls from people

29:38.720 --> 29:40.598
at the soccer game
at Central City Stadium.

29:40.680 --> 29:41.955
It's all over
the news, too.

29:42.040 --> 29:43.136
Okay, I'm going to get
over there.

29:43.160 --> 29:44.416
CCPD already cleared out
the stadium.

29:44.440 --> 29:45.976
Find the bomb,
and we'll help you disarm it.

29:46.000 --> 29:48.435
- What's going on?
- I'll tell you on the way.

29:48.520 --> 29:49.636
Come on.

29:58.080 --> 30:00.879
- Nothing, you?
- No.

30:02.480 --> 30:04.153
Iris, there's no bomb.

30:08.360 --> 30:12.274
Guys, look at the timestamp
on Spencer's post.

30:12.360 --> 30:14.033
11:05 a.m.

30:14.120 --> 30:15.873
Yeah, and now look at
the time that CCPD

30:16.000 --> 30:17.680
got the first call
about the bomb sighting.

30:17.720 --> 30:18.995
It was five minutes later.

30:19.080 --> 30:21.151
Hey, can you bring up
Officer Jones' brain scan?

30:21.240 --> 30:22.594
I'm going to run the code

30:22.680 --> 30:24.592
of Spencer's post
through the decompiler.

30:27.320 --> 30:29.596
Let's see what's underneath.

30:34.600 --> 30:35.875
Got it.

30:40.400 --> 30:43.393
Done. The brain scan.
The code is an exact match.

30:46.480 --> 30:48.790
- Barry, it's the headlines.
- What?

30:48.880 --> 30:50.758
<i>That's how Spencer's
hypnotizing people.</i>

30:50.840 --> 30:54.595
They're reading her headlines!
Don't look at them.

30:54.680 --> 30:56.512
Aah! Too late!

31:18.000 --> 31:19.400
Nora's been hypnotized.

31:19.520 --> 31:21.193
She's trying to kill me.

31:21.280 --> 31:23.920
Nora, you got
to snap out of this.

31:24.000 --> 31:27.437
What I have
to do is kill you.

31:40.400 --> 31:41.993
Caitlin, take over.

31:42.080 --> 31:45.676
- Where are you going?
- To get my family back.

31:45.760 --> 31:48.355
Hurry up
and kill him already.

32:33.080 --> 32:35.311
Time to bounce.

32:39.800 --> 32:41.598
Hey, you're going to be okay.
All right?

32:41.680 --> 32:43.592
Nice shot!

32:43.680 --> 32:46.434
Guys, do we know
where Spencer is?

32:46.520 --> 32:49.433
I can't ping her phone. CCPD
disabled all the cell towers

32:49.520 --> 32:51.591
in the area to prevent
a remote bomb detonation.

32:51.680 --> 32:53.637
She must be local
in order to put those headlines

32:53.720 --> 32:55.677
up on that
big screen, right?

32:55.760 --> 32:58.150
- She's at the stadium.
- She's here.

33:02.080 --> 33:05.437
Looks like you'll be trading
this cell in for another.

33:09.720 --> 33:12.030
All right, Spencer's all locked
up in Iron Heights.

33:12.120 --> 33:13.952
- The Mayor's resigning.
- What?

33:14.040 --> 33:15.679
I'm surprised
she lasted this long.

33:15.760 --> 33:17.513
Luckily, I was able to get
a quote from her

33:17.640 --> 33:19.871
exonerating Officer Jones
for my article.

33:19.960 --> 33:22.077
Post will go up tomorrow.

33:22.160 --> 33:24.629
Papa Joe will be relieved
his friend's in the clear.

33:24.720 --> 33:26.200
Yeah.

33:26.280 --> 33:27.960
Well, at least now,
with Spencer behind us,

33:28.040 --> 33:30.839
we can concentrate
on bigger fish.

33:30.920 --> 33:33.116
Yes, we can.

33:33.200 --> 33:34.953
So...
Uh, Sherlock...

33:35.040 --> 33:38.590
- Sherloque.
- He thinks he's found a key

33:38.680 --> 33:40.114
to Cicada's identity.

33:40.200 --> 33:43.193
A crucial clue to help us
solve our little mystery.

33:43.280 --> 33:45.795
So we all know the distinctive
sound of Cicada's breathing

33:45.880 --> 33:47.519
due to the respirator
in the mask.

33:47.600 --> 33:51.560
But not just that, because
also his lungs are injured.

33:51.640 --> 33:53.233
But injured from what?

33:53.320 --> 33:56.154
Historically, there is an
event that causes David Hersch

33:56.240 --> 33:59.199
to always become Cicada,
but not this time.

33:59.280 --> 34:00.999
There's a different Cicada
because...

34:01.080 --> 34:03.834
Because Nora helped me
destroy the satellite.

34:05.800 --> 34:07.439
<i>Monsieur Allen, Nora's strike</i>

34:07.520 --> 34:08.520
<i>through the satellite</i>

34:08.600 --> 34:11.034
changed the trajectory of
the debris, and now the debris

34:11.120 --> 34:13.793
has hit a new person
and injured...

34:13.880 --> 34:15.871
our new Cicada.

34:15.960 --> 34:17.871
Okay, but how did
that give him his powers?

34:17.960 --> 34:20.315
DeVoe flooded the satellite
with dark matter.

34:20.400 --> 34:23.598
It makes sense that the pieces
would be saturated.

34:23.679 --> 34:26.320
So Cicada and the dagger
were created

34:26.400 --> 34:28.516
the night
of the Enlightenment.

34:28.600 --> 34:32.275
Acquired powers together.

34:32.360 --> 34:34.112
Well, listen, Sherloke...

34:34.199 --> 34:36.635
- Sherloque.
- I got to hand it to you.

34:36.760 --> 34:38.274
That's very impressive.

34:38.360 --> 34:42.149
It's quite a breakthrough,
right, Monsieur Dibny?

34:42.239 --> 34:45.233
One that I cannot take
any credit for.

34:45.320 --> 34:47.994
No, all the credit,
all the praise

34:48.080 --> 34:50.150
goes to you,
Monsieur Dibny.

34:50.239 --> 34:53.199
It was your instincts
to follow the mask, right?

34:53.280 --> 34:56.751
Well, you were right,
and I was...

34:56.840 --> 34:58.274
less right.

35:01.080 --> 35:02.912
I apologize.

35:05.920 --> 35:07.877
Okay, guys, I'm sorry.

35:08.000 --> 35:09.536
The dagger part
still doesn't make sense.

35:09.560 --> 35:13.076
I mean, things can't
become metas, right?

35:14.840 --> 35:16.797
I don't know about that.

35:22.800 --> 35:26.237
Our satellite didn't
just create new metas.

35:26.320 --> 35:29.233
It created meta-tech.

35:29.320 --> 35:33.030
Which puts meta-human
abilities in the hands of...

35:33.120 --> 35:34.156
anyone.

35:50.840 --> 35:53.560
Hey.

35:53.640 --> 35:56.280
Caitlin says
you're going to be fine.

35:58.680 --> 36:02.356
I'm sorry for suppressing
your powers, but...

36:03.280 --> 36:06.114
I think it was
the right thing to do.

36:06.200 --> 36:08.317
Yeah. No, I-I...

36:08.400 --> 36:11.393
I get it. I mean,
I was trying to kill Dad.

36:11.520 --> 36:14.558
I would've done
the same thing, too.

36:14.640 --> 36:16.597
No, that's...

36:16.680 --> 36:19.320
That's not what I mean.

36:19.400 --> 36:21.710
I'm talking about
in the future.

36:23.360 --> 36:25.033
What?

36:25.160 --> 36:27.800
I know that you're upset
and angry.

36:27.880 --> 36:30.679
And honestly, I...

36:31.640 --> 36:33.416
Before today, I couldn't
even imagine a situation

36:33.440 --> 36:36.194
where I would do something
like that to you.

36:36.760 --> 36:39.798
But after seeing the choice
that I just made...

36:41.040 --> 36:43.396
I know that whatever reason
I would have

36:43.480 --> 36:46.996
for keeping your powers
a secret, it...

36:47.920 --> 36:50.913
it must have been
a good one, Nora.

36:51.920 --> 36:54.151
It must have been
to protect you.

36:54.240 --> 36:55.754
No.

36:57.160 --> 36:59.436
What happened today...

37:00.080 --> 37:03.960
has nothing to do with what
happens in the future.

37:04.040 --> 37:07.431
<i>You didn't suppress
my abilities my whole life</i>

37:07.520 --> 37:12.276
because I was brainwashed
or attacking people.

37:12.360 --> 37:15.956
You did it to control me.

37:18.200 --> 37:21.432
My whole life
I felt like I was different

37:21.520 --> 37:24.911
than everybody else,
but I didn't know why.

37:26.000 --> 37:27.878
You took a choice away
from me

37:27.960 --> 37:30.873
that I didn't even know
that I had...

37:33.200 --> 37:37.240
A choice to be a hero,
like my dad.

37:39.520 --> 37:41.113
What's going on?

37:43.760 --> 37:46.639
- Nothing, we're just talking.
- No.

37:46.720 --> 37:50.157
Mom thinks that she had good
reason to suppress my powers

37:50.240 --> 37:54.678
in the future, but she doesn't
know what that reason is.

37:59.160 --> 38:01.755
I'm sure it's a good one.

38:04.560 --> 38:07.280
Look, Nora, I don't have
to visit the future

38:07.360 --> 38:09.795
to know what kind of mother
Iris is going to be.

38:09.880 --> 38:13.840
She cares about family
more than anyone I've ever met.

38:13.920 --> 38:16.151
<i>Okay? And...</i>

38:16.240 --> 38:18.357
I support her decisions...

38:18.480 --> 38:21.234
past, present, and future.

38:26.400 --> 38:29.313
Then I guess I need
to rethink what the meaning

38:29.400 --> 38:31.960
of family is.

38:32.040 --> 38:34.316
Nora, wait.

38:34.400 --> 38:36.278
Do you know what hurt
the most

38:36.360 --> 38:38.238
about learning I had powers?

38:40.000 --> 38:42.959
Not hearing it from my mom.

38:51.720 --> 38:54.633
It's all right.

39:04.240 --> 39:06.118
- Hi.
- Nora, hi.

39:06.200 --> 39:09.432
Um, it's kind of
a long story,

39:09.520 --> 39:11.876
but can I stay here?

39:14.080 --> 39:15.309
Get in here, kid.

39:16.960 --> 39:19.316
Are you sure it's
not too much trouble?

39:19.400 --> 39:22.916
It's fine. Maybe talk
about the reason later?

39:23.000 --> 39:26.789
But for now, there's some fresh
pillows and blankets upstairs.

39:26.880 --> 39:29.076
Thanks, Papa Joe.

39:59.480 --> 40:01.790
Aah!

41:10.840 --> 41:12.274
<i>Greg, move your head.</i>
