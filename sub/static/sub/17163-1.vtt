01:28.640 --> 01:30.551
<i>Henry Joseph Church
could have been...</i>

01:30.640 --> 01:32.950
<i>anything he wanted to be.</i>

01:33.040 --> 01:35.429
<i>He chose to cook.</i>

01:35.520 --> 01:38.592
<i>The key, he said, jazz.</i>

02:21.560 --> 02:23.676
Mama, wake up, wake up.

02:23.760 --> 02:25.273
Baby, baby, what is it?

02:25.360 --> 02:27.476
There's a black man
in our kitchen cooking eggs.

02:29.000 --> 02:30.957
Baby, that's okay.

02:31.040 --> 02:34.590
It's Mr. Church, our new cook.

02:34.680 --> 02:36.079
- New cook?
- Mm-hmm.

02:36.160 --> 02:37.594
We never had an old cook.

02:37.680 --> 02:40.752
You know what?
Mama just needs a tiny bit more rest.

02:40.840 --> 02:44.720
I'll-- Go introduce yourself.
I'll be there soon.

02:51.040 --> 02:53.270
<i>Mr. Church used to work
for Richard Cannon...</i>

02:53.400 --> 02:54.629
<i>who was Mama's lover.</i>

02:54.720 --> 02:56.597
<i>But he wasn't my daddy.</i>

02:56.680 --> 02:58.830
<i>When Mama found out
Richard was married...</i>

02:58.920 --> 03:00.911
<i>she ended it,
though she still loved him.</i>

03:01.000 --> 03:02.195
Morning, baby.

03:02.280 --> 03:03.634
<i>When Richard was sick...</i>

03:03.720 --> 03:06.314
<i>the lasz' thing he said to Mama was</i>
"I'll <i>care for you...</i>

03:06.400 --> 03:08.152
<i>until my dying day and beyond."</i>

03:08.280 --> 03:10.271
- Good morning, Mr. Church.
- Oh, good morning, ma'am.

03:10.360 --> 03:12.670
<i>I guess Mr. Church
was the "beyond" part.</i>

03:12.760 --> 03:14.239
I see you met Charlie.

03:14.320 --> 03:15.719
Well, not officially.

03:15.840 --> 03:18.070
Oh, well, Charlie,
where's your manners?

03:18.160 --> 03:20.071
Good morning, Charlotte.
My name's Mr. Church.

03:20.160 --> 03:21.878
- How are you?
- Fine.

03:21.960 --> 03:24.474
Wow, this looks delicious.
Thank you, Mr. Church.

03:24.600 --> 03:26.989
You are most welcome, ma'am.

03:27.080 --> 03:28.309
Come on, baby.
Eat up.

03:28.400 --> 03:29.595
I want Apple Jacks.

03:29.680 --> 03:31.591
- Charlie!
- What are Apple Jacks?

03:31.680 --> 03:33.273
Well, it's a cereal.

03:33.400 --> 03:35.152
It tastes like apples.

03:35.240 --> 03:36.913
Well, and sugar, mainly.

03:37.000 --> 03:39.071
You've never heard of Apple Jacks?

03:39.160 --> 03:40.639
- Hey, don't be rude.
- I can make the child...

03:40.720 --> 03:42.074
some Apple Jacks
if that's what she wants--

03:42.200 --> 03:44.032
It's already made.
It comes in a box.

03:44.160 --> 03:45.480
Add milk and you're done.

03:46.920 --> 03:48.274
She doesn't need it.

03:48.360 --> 03:49.555
Well, she got
to eat something, ma'am.

03:49.640 --> 03:51.358
You have made an incredible meal.
Charlie, eat.

03:51.440 --> 03:53.477
What is this?

03:53.560 --> 03:55.312
You never heard of grits?

03:56.680 --> 03:58.398
There are a lot of secrets
in my grits.

04:00.680 --> 04:03.877
This is delicious.
You got to try some, sweetie.

04:03.960 --> 04:06.759
Charlotte Marie Brooks,
you sit your butt down right now.

04:08.080 --> 04:09.479
I'm going to count to three, okay?

04:09.600 --> 04:12.035
One...two...

04:12.120 --> 04:13.349
Mr. Church, excuse me.

04:13.480 --> 04:14.595
I want cereal!

04:16.920 --> 04:18.433
You're embarrassing me.

04:18.519 --> 04:19.999
Why is he here?

04:20.079 --> 04:23.072
I don't know.
Because Richard wanted it this way.

04:23.200 --> 04:25.635
- And I want Apple Jacks.
- Charlie...

04:25.720 --> 04:27.393
What times does he go home?

04:27.480 --> 04:29.153
I guess when he's done.

04:29.240 --> 04:31.311
- When is he done?
- When we're done.

04:31.400 --> 04:32.879
Well, we're done.

04:33.000 --> 04:34.479
Oh, Charlie, please.

04:34.560 --> 04:36.437
It makes no sense.

04:36.520 --> 04:38.079
It's what Richard wanted.

04:38.160 --> 04:40.879
Who cares what he wanted?
He's dead.

04:42.280 --> 04:44.237
- Morning, Gibby.
- Morning, dear. Charlie.

04:44.320 --> 04:45.594
Morning, Gibby.

04:45.720 --> 04:47.074
How are you two this morning?

04:47.160 --> 04:48.992
We're fine.

04:49.080 --> 04:50.195
We have a cook.

04:50.280 --> 04:52.430
That's nice, dear.

04:52.560 --> 04:53.994
Here, take this.

04:54.080 --> 04:56.310
You drink coffee all day.
I eat Apple Jacks.

04:56.440 --> 04:58.909
- We don't need a cook.
- Well, Richard seems to think we did.

04:59.000 --> 05:00.559
If Richard really cared about you...

05:00.640 --> 05:01.835
he would have married you.

05:04.120 --> 05:05.918
Mr. Church won't be staying.

05:06.000 --> 05:08.833
I'm sure he's already realized
what a mistake all this is.

05:08.920 --> 05:10.877
Come on, Charlie.
We gotta move.

05:10.960 --> 05:12.519
Love you.

05:19.160 --> 05:22.357
<i>It was always hard
to stay mad at Mama.</i>

05:22.440 --> 05:25.398
<i>She was too nice,
and far too beautiful.</i>

05:28.960 --> 05:30.394
<i>I was always looking...</i>

05:30.480 --> 05:33.871
<i>trying to find someone
more beautiful than my mama.</i>

05:33.960 --> 05:34.995
<i>But I never could.</i>

05:36.680 --> 05:38.990
<i>And out of everyone
in the whole wide world...</i>

05:39.080 --> 05:41.959
<i>she loved me most.</i>

05:44.200 --> 05:46.760
Hey, Mr. Church,
could I have a word with you?

05:46.840 --> 05:48.956
Oh, man.
I'm going to need to go to the market.

05:49.040 --> 05:50.474
Yeah, well, it's about all that.

05:50.560 --> 05:52.551
Yeah, I brought some groceries
with me today, ma'am...

05:52.640 --> 05:55.154
but no offense, all you got in here
is some condiments and stuff.

05:55.240 --> 05:56.514
There's nothing to spread them on.

05:56.600 --> 05:59.069
I suppose I haven't been
to the store in a while.

05:59.160 --> 06:01.071
Could we just hold off
on that for a second?

06:01.160 --> 06:02.753
I wanted to wait
till Charlie was at school...

06:02.880 --> 06:04.791
- before speaking with you--
- Ma'am, you're shivering.

06:04.880 --> 06:07.349
Yeah, I forgot my jacket.
It's kind of chilly out.

06:07.440 --> 06:09.511
Maybe you want to put on
a sweater or something.

06:09.600 --> 06:10.635
Yeah, I will. I just--

06:10.720 --> 06:18.673
'Cause you don't want
to get sick, ma'am.

06:18.760 --> 06:20.637
He told you.

06:20.720 --> 06:22.233
<i>Yes, ma'am.</i>

06:24.000 --> 06:25.320
What'd he say?

06:26.000 --> 06:27.957
That you have a cancer
in your breast...

06:28.040 --> 06:30.873
and that you're dying, ma'am.

06:33.160 --> 06:35.595
Did he tell you
how long I have?

06:36.520 --> 06:37.635
Six months, ma'am.

06:37.720 --> 06:41.031
Mr. Church, we're talking
about my breast and dying.

06:41.120 --> 06:44.317
You can drop
the "ma'am" stuff, okay?

06:44.400 --> 06:45.834
Because it's Marie.

06:45.920 --> 06:47.479
You really think
you should be smoking...

06:47.560 --> 06:48.789
in your condition, ma'am?

06:48.880 --> 06:51.679
Absolutely.

06:54.280 --> 06:55.759
How'd you do on your English test?

06:55.840 --> 06:57.353
Hmm, I think I failed.

07:03.600 --> 07:06.035
Good morning, Miss Samuels.
Good morning, Miss Brooks.

07:06.120 --> 07:07.110
How are you this morning?

07:07.200 --> 07:08.873
Oh, well, we have a cook.

07:08.960 --> 07:10.997
He's black, he makes grits
with secrets...

07:11.080 --> 07:13.356
and he's hanging out in our kitchen.

07:22.840 --> 07:27.232
So, what kind of a deal
did Richard make with you?

07:27.320 --> 07:29.630
I was just asked to cook
for you and your child...

07:29.760 --> 07:31.910
till you passed on, ma'am.

07:32.000 --> 07:36.710
And certainly you're getting
something out of this.

07:36.800 --> 07:39.235
Well, Mr. Cannon guaranteed me
a lifetime salary...

07:39.320 --> 07:40.276
if I kept my word.

07:41.480 --> 07:43.198
Not bad.

07:43.280 --> 07:44.998
Total financial security...

07:45.080 --> 07:47.640
in exchange
for six months of meals.

07:47.720 --> 07:51.793
So, you got yourself
a pretty good deal, Mr. Church.

07:53.400 --> 07:55.391
<i>Yes, ma'am.</i>

07:55.480 --> 07:57.471
Come on.

07:58.560 --> 07:59.630
Hey, Charlie.

08:01.520 --> 08:03.796
<i>Owen Baxter was by far...</i>

08:03.920 --> 08:05.479
<i>the most gorgeous 10-year-old boy...</i>

08:05.560 --> 08:08.871
<i>that ever breathed on this
or any other planet.</i>

08:10.000 --> 08:11.559
<i>I, on the other hand...</i>

08:11.640 --> 08:14.029
<i>was about the most awkward
10-year-old girl...</i>

08:14.120 --> 08:16.589
<i>on this or any other planet.</i>

08:16.680 --> 08:18.796
Come on, Owen.

08:20.360 --> 08:21.759
What is it?

08:21.840 --> 08:23.433
Who knows?

08:25.000 --> 08:26.911
Look at you...

08:27.000 --> 08:29.071
already bringing
fancy sandwiches to lunch...

08:29.160 --> 08:31.276
Miss I Have a Cook Brooks.

08:31.360 --> 08:32.155
Can I come see him?

08:32.280 --> 08:34.919
I told you, he's leaving.

08:35.000 --> 08:36.433
Probably gone already.

08:36.520 --> 08:39.433
Oh, if you don't want him, I do.

08:39.520 --> 08:42.672
<i>Our private school took
a few charity cases a year.</i>

08:42.760 --> 08:44.990
<i>The year I turned five, it was me...</i>

08:45.080 --> 08:48.436
<i>and Poppy Samuels,
my one and only friend.</i>

08:48.520 --> 08:50.670
<i>She lived with her sister
because both of her folks...</i>

08:50.800 --> 08:53.360
<i>were serving time in prison
for a robbery gone wrong.</i>

08:53.440 --> 08:56.558
<i>And even with that,
she was more popular than me.</i>

08:56.680 --> 08:58.000
Tell you something, Charlie...

08:58.080 --> 08:59.673
it's not every day you get a cook.

08:59.760 --> 09:02.115
It might be nice having a man
around to help your mama out.

09:02.200 --> 09:04.191
We've always done fine.

09:04.280 --> 09:06.715
We don't need a man,
and we sure as hell don't need a cook.

09:06.800 --> 09:09.872
My sister says every woman
needs a man.

09:09.960 --> 09:12.759
Sometimes more than one.

09:12.840 --> 09:14.478
Where'd you get all that?

09:14.560 --> 09:17.029
Stole it from my sister's dresser.

09:17.160 --> 09:19.959
Stealing's the one thing
us Samuels are good at.

09:22.920 --> 09:24.513
Yeah?

09:24.600 --> 09:25.954
Excuse me, ma'am.

09:26.040 --> 09:27.678
I'm about to head out to the market.

09:27.760 --> 09:30.229
Okay. Um...

09:30.320 --> 09:32.470
We shop at Gordon's.
Is that all right?

09:32.560 --> 09:35.313
Oh, yeah, that's fine.
Yeah, yeah.

09:35.400 --> 09:37.869
You know, Mr. Church,
if we're going to do this...

09:37.960 --> 09:39.394
let me at least give you some money.

09:39.480 --> 09:41.471
I've only got $12, but--

09:41.600 --> 09:43.159
Oh, ma'am, don't worry about that.

09:43.240 --> 09:46.995
Mr. Cannon opened up an account
for me to draw off...

09:47.080 --> 09:48.150
for marketing and such.

09:48.240 --> 09:49.719
"And such?"

09:49.800 --> 09:54.510
Well, your medical bills
and rent and medicine.

09:54.600 --> 09:56.637
That's all taken care of,
courtesy of Mr. Cannon...

09:56.720 --> 10:00.315
for the next six months.

10:00.400 --> 10:02.311
And what, in his estimation...

10:02.400 --> 10:03.720
did six months of life come to?

10:03.800 --> 10:05.279
Beg your pardon, ma'am?

10:05.360 --> 10:06.794
Never mind.

10:06.880 --> 10:08.154
You know what?

10:08.240 --> 10:09.719
At least take some coupons, you know?

10:09.800 --> 10:11.837
I'm not completely helpless.

10:11.920 --> 10:13.957
- It couldn't hurt.
- Yeah, it couldn't hurt at all.

10:14.040 --> 10:15.599
All right. Okay.

10:15.680 --> 10:18.035
Oh, Mr. Church, um...

10:19.440 --> 10:22.114
Charlie doesn't know that I'm sick...

10:22.200 --> 10:24.111
and I'd like to keep it that way.

10:26.200 --> 10:28.794
Oh. As you wish, ma'am.

10:28.880 --> 10:30.712
I'll be back shortly, all right?

10:45.760 --> 10:47.910
All right, $43.32, sir.

10:48.040 --> 10:50.350
Hey, wait a minute, you know,
I forgot all about these.

10:50.440 --> 10:52.590
Great. Let's see.

10:53.680 --> 10:55.512
$37.83, sir.

10:55.600 --> 10:57.830
- So I saved about $6 there?
- Yes, sir.

10:57.920 --> 11:00.389
That's not bad.

11:00.480 --> 11:01.675
No, sir.

11:07.160 --> 11:09.470
Hey, Charlie.

11:09.560 --> 11:11.198
Hi, Larson.

11:11.280 --> 11:13.590
<i>Eddie Larson.</i>

11:13.680 --> 11:17.310
<i>Forced to ride public transportation
for the rest of his life.</i>

11:17.400 --> 11:19.630
<i>Just one week after getting
his driver's license.</i>

11:19.720 --> 11:21.870
<i>he got drunk and crashed his Chevy Camaro...</i>

11:21.960 --> 11:23.997
<i>into the living room
of Mr. and Mrs. Howard...</i>

11:24.120 --> 11:25.679
<i>killing their 4-year-old son.</i>

11:26.560 --> 11:29.120
<i>Spent three years in juvenile penitentiary...</i>

11:29.200 --> 11:32.113
<i>and no doubt the rest of his life
in the worst hell of all...</i>

11:32.200 --> 11:33.759
<i>the one between the eyes.</i>

11:33.880 --> 11:36.440
How's...how's school, Charlie?

11:36.520 --> 11:38.079
We have a cook.

11:38.160 --> 11:40.151
What, at the school?

11:40.240 --> 11:41.514
At my house.

11:41.600 --> 11:44.194
Oh, yeah. That's far out.

11:44.280 --> 11:47.591
Mama's going to tell him to leave.

11:47.680 --> 11:49.353
Why?
Who wouldn't want a cook?

11:54.200 --> 11:57.556
Hi, Mama.

11:57.640 --> 11:59.278
So, how was work today?

11:59.360 --> 12:00.873
Good.

12:00.960 --> 12:02.633
I saw Miss Carol's baby.

12:02.720 --> 12:04.199
Hey, gorgeous.

12:04.280 --> 12:05.953
Can't you see I'm with my child?

12:07.720 --> 12:10.997
I saw Miss Carol's baby,
and I finally got him...

12:11.080 --> 12:13.196
to latch on for feeding.

12:13.280 --> 12:14.475
You know, holding those babies...

12:14.560 --> 12:16.870
it always makes me think
of the first time I held you.

12:16.960 --> 12:19.634
Even if I was an accident.

12:19.720 --> 12:22.314
Why on Earth would you say that?

12:22.400 --> 12:24.676
Your daddy was the accident.

12:24.760 --> 12:28.469
You, you're my miracle.

12:28.600 --> 12:30.113
How much do I love you?

12:30.200 --> 12:34.034
So much.

12:35.400 --> 12:38.518
So, how did the cook
take the news he was fired?

12:38.600 --> 12:40.637
Oh, ma'am, I hope you don't mind.

12:40.720 --> 12:42.677
I bring books with me
every place I go...

12:42.760 --> 12:44.592
and I noticed that your shelf
was kind of empty.

12:44.680 --> 12:46.193
He's still here, Mama.

12:46.280 --> 12:48.556
- Why is he still here?
- Charlie, we'll discuss this later.

12:49.720 --> 12:52.712
That's great.
Cookbooks, right?

12:52.800 --> 12:53.995
Oh, no, no, ma'am.
Not cookbooks.

12:54.080 --> 12:55.275
I never read books about cooking.

12:55.360 --> 12:57.670
These are mostly novels
and plays and, you know...

12:57.760 --> 13:00.274
about people like Capote
and Shakespeare.

13:00.360 --> 13:02.749
- Wow.
- And Greeks and Agatha Christie.

13:02.840 --> 13:04.990
And here's one I think
the girl might like.

13:05.080 --> 13:07.720
Autobiography of Shirley Temple.

13:07.880 --> 13:10.110
<i>Good Ship Lollipop.</i>

13:10.200 --> 13:11.679
I hate reading.

13:11.760 --> 13:12.511
Charlie!

13:12.680 --> 13:14.830
Oh, that is a shame,
because there's nothing like...

13:14.920 --> 13:15.751
a really good story.

13:15.840 --> 13:18.036
- Keep your stupid books.
- Hey, that's enough.

13:18.120 --> 13:19.440
No, that's okay, ma'am.

13:19.520 --> 13:21.909
But, listen, if you do ever want
to read one of these books...

13:22.000 --> 13:23.513
you're going to have
to check it out.

13:23.600 --> 13:25.989
- What, like a library?
- Exactly like a library.

13:26.080 --> 13:27.639
Made a card up for you
and everything.

13:27.720 --> 13:29.870
And ma'am, you feel free.
Whenever you want, you can read these books.

13:29.960 --> 13:30.916
And if you like, I'll bring more.

13:31.000 --> 13:34.038
A house could always
use books, right?

13:36.440 --> 13:38.716
I'm sorry, Mr. Church.

13:38.800 --> 13:39.756
She'll get used to it.

13:39.880 --> 13:42.554
She's just a child.
She doesn't understand.

13:42.640 --> 13:44.074
Oh, sure, ma'am.

13:44.240 --> 13:45.992
Look, I'll have dinner ready
for you and the child...

13:46.080 --> 13:48.799
about 6:00 tonight, then after that,
I'll take care of the dishes.

13:48.880 --> 13:50.234
Then I'll take my leave
for the evening.

13:50.360 --> 13:52.749
6:00 it is.
Thank you, Mr. Church.

13:52.840 --> 13:54.239
You're most welcome.

14:01.960 --> 14:03.553
Dinnertime.

14:03.640 --> 14:05.517
I'm not hungry.

14:05.600 --> 14:06.954
Baby“.

14:08.680 --> 14:12.275
This is the way it's going to be.

14:12.360 --> 14:16.991
So, I suggest you find a way
to stop complaining...

14:17.080 --> 14:18.832
and start enjoying the food.

14:20.760 --> 14:24.390
Mr. Church asked me
to give you this.

14:28.760 --> 14:31.149
<i>Complaining wasn't easy to stop.</i>

14:31.240 --> 14:32.435
Oh.

14:32.520 --> 14:34.272
<i>Enjoying the food was a breeze.</i>

14:34.360 --> 14:35.714
- Wow.
- Enjoy.

14:35.800 --> 14:38.269
<i>But I wasn't about to let
Mr. Church or Mama know it.</i>

14:38.360 --> 14:41.193
Charlie, come on, eat it.

14:41.280 --> 14:45.831
<i>As far as the y were concerned,
every bite was torture for me.</i>

14:45.920 --> 14:51.757
<i>Secretly, I couldn't wait to taste
what was coming next.</i>

14:51.840 --> 14:55.310
<i>Ana' what came next was always
something magnificent.</i>

14:56.720 --> 14:58.552
<i>ll' was like e party
every night.</i>

14:58.640 --> 15:00.916
<i>Every morning.</i>

15:17.840 --> 15:19.956
<i>It was like a party every afternoon.</i>

15:23.520 --> 15:26.558
<i>I finally let Poppy
over to meet Mr. Church.</i>

15:26.640 --> 15:28.836
<i>Once I did,
I couldn't get rid of her.</i>

15:28.920 --> 15:31.070
Mr. Church,
this is the best lemonade...

15:31.200 --> 15:32.520
I've ever tasted.

15:32.600 --> 15:35.353
The secret to that,
my dear, is the licorice.

15:35.440 --> 15:39.035
You and your secrets, Mr. Church.

15:39.120 --> 15:41.111
My sister loved
the banana bread you made.

15:41.200 --> 15:42.554
Oh, thank you, Poppy-

15:42.640 --> 15:44.517
"My sister loved
the banana bread you made."

15:44.600 --> 15:46.079
She did.

15:51.800 --> 15:54.633
<i>And in the morning,
Mr. Church was in the kitchen...</i>

15:54.720 --> 15:57.360
<i>long before I was awake.</i>

15:57.440 --> 16:00.319
<i>The smells of cooking
were like my alarm clock.</i>

16:06.720 --> 16:09.109
<i>Mr. Church could make or bake
anything you wanted...</i>

16:09.200 --> 16:11.794
<i>and even things
you didn't know you wanted...</i>

16:11.880 --> 16:14.235
<i>until after you tasted them.</i>

16:14.320 --> 16:16.152
<i>I never once saw Mr. Church
use a measuring fool...</i>

16:16.240 --> 16:18.117
<i>or any fancy utensil.</i>

16:18.200 --> 16:20.271
<i>Just his hands, fork, and knife.</i>

16:29.280 --> 16:31.999
Come on, baby.
We'll be late for the bus.

16:40.680 --> 16:42.512
Oh, I've got a winner.

16:42.600 --> 16:44.989
This is the toothpaste
that Charlie likes.

16:46.880 --> 16:48.553
So, I finished this one.

16:50.320 --> 16:52.960
I still don't see why
they couldn't be together.

16:53.040 --> 16:55.429
Next time, I want a story
that's not going to make me...

16:55.520 --> 16:56.749
CW my eyes out.

16:56.840 --> 17:00.879
Some writers ain't happy
till they made the reader cry.

17:00.960 --> 17:03.873
And some readers
ain't happy till they do.

17:14.000 --> 17:16.195
<i>I'd watch Mr. Church leave...</i>

17:16.280 --> 17:18.635
<i>knowing that in just a few short hours...</i>

17:18.720 --> 17:22.076
<i>he'd return with bags and bags
of goodies to explore.</i>

17:34.600 --> 17:36.398
- Whoa!
- Oh! Oh! Oh!

17:36.480 --> 17:37.834
- Oh, baby!
- I got her. I got you, I got you.

17:37.920 --> 17:39.354
- Are you okay?
- I got you. She's okay.

17:39.440 --> 17:41.158
- Oh, my God. Thank you.
- Let me get this stuff here.

17:41.240 --> 17:42.310
- Thank you, Mr. Church.
- It's okay.

17:42.400 --> 17:43.834
Yeah, there's glass everywhere.

17:43.920 --> 17:45.240
- Watch where you're stepping.
- Let me--

17:45.320 --> 17:46.230
Watch out.
No, I got it.

17:46.320 --> 17:47.719
I got this, ma'am.

17:47.800 --> 17:49.552
Let me--
<i>I'll</i> take care of this.

17:49.640 --> 17:50.869
Okay, thank you.

17:50.960 --> 17:53.031
What child would like
to get cut?

18:07.880 --> 18:09.393
Mr. Church.

18:09.480 --> 18:12.199
I'd like to check out
a book, if that's okay.

18:17.200 --> 18:19.032
How about if I make
some suggestions.

18:30.040 --> 18:32.509
Now, this is kind of long,
but it's worth the journey.

18:32.600 --> 18:34.398
I read it a couple of times myself...

18:34.480 --> 18:36.278
so you don't got
to be gentle with it.

18:36.360 --> 18:39.398
Books was meant
to be broken in.

18:39.480 --> 18:41.039
Good night, my dear.

19:09.640 --> 19:11.278
<i>And through it all...</i>

19:11.360 --> 19:15.149
<i>I never knew about the promise
Mr. Church made to Richard.</i>

19:15.240 --> 19:17.390
<i>I never knew
Mama was dying.</i>

19:17.480 --> 19:21.360
<i>I never knew anything
until much, much later.</i>

19:21.440 --> 19:23.670
<i>The only thing I knew
at ten years old...</i>

19:23.760 --> 19:25.114
<i>was that one morning
I woke up...</i>

19:25.200 --> 19:26.395
<i>and we had a cook.</i>

19:26.480 --> 19:28.039
<i>And one other thing.</i>

19:28.120 --> 19:31.033
<i>He was to be gone
in six months.</i>

19:31.120 --> 19:32.519
<i>But six months...</i>

19:34.400 --> 19:36.437
<i>...turned into six years.</i>

19:36.520 --> 19:38.670
<i>Turns out Mama was a miracle.</i>

19:38.760 --> 19:40.717
<i>She boxed that mean, old cancer...</i>

19:40.800 --> 19:43.792
<i>every day, giving it lefts,
rights, uppercuts.</i>

19:43.880 --> 19:46.235
<i>And all the while,
I never knew she was is the ring.</i>

19:46.320 --> 19:47.674
Hey, Charlie.

19:47.760 --> 19:48.909
Hi.
Owen, is it true...

19:49.040 --> 19:50.519
that Stevie hasn't
asked me to the prom...

19:50.600 --> 19:51.954
because his folks
don't approve?

19:52.040 --> 19:53.189
Don't know
anything about it.

19:53.280 --> 19:56.398
I heard he's taking Nora Williams
because she's a notorious virgin.

20:00.160 --> 20:02.356
Ugh, I told my sister
never to honk.

20:02.440 --> 20:04.750
She just can't help
embarrassing me.

20:04.840 --> 20:05.989
I can't wait
till I'm 18.

20:06.080 --> 20:08.549
I can get away
from this stinking place.

20:12.440 --> 20:13.999
Walk you
to the bus?

20:14.080 --> 20:15.593
Sure.

20:19.560 --> 20:21.471
Are you really
going to read all these?

20:21.560 --> 20:24.712
I already did.
Just returning them.

20:26.640 --> 20:28.438
How's your mom doing?

20:28.520 --> 20:30.272
She's fine.

20:31.920 --> 20:33.638
Coming to the game
tonight?

20:33.720 --> 20:37.076
I can't really
go out at night.

20:37.160 --> 20:38.673
Not ever?

20:38.760 --> 20:42.355
Not even for,
say, prom?

20:44.800 --> 20:46.120
Would you go
with me, Charlie?

20:49.200 --> 20:52.795
L...l got to go.

20:52.880 --> 20:55.349
L...l...l got to go.

20:55.480 --> 20:56.914
I'll take that
as a maybe.

21:05.960 --> 21:09.555
<i>DD...</i>

21:32.240 --> 21:34.675
<i>Every time I walked in that room...</i>

21:34.760 --> 21:37.752
<i>I held my breath
so I could listen for hers.</i>

21:37.840 --> 21:39.831
<i>Hoping it would still be there.</i>

21:46.120 --> 21:47.554
<i>Sometimes it was so soft...</i>

21:47.640 --> 21:49.836
<i>I had to climb onto the bed
and put my ear up to her mouth...</i>

21:49.920 --> 21:51.558
<i>just to make sure.</i>

21:51.640 --> 21:53.517
<i>Other times,
it was so heavy with struggle...</i>

21:53.600 --> 21:57.309
<i>that I had to back as far away
as I could just to stand it.</i>

21:57.400 --> 21:58.959
<i>And other times...</i>

21:59.040 --> 22:01.714
<i>it was all Mama.</i>

22:04.320 --> 22:05.754
There she is.

22:05.840 --> 22:08.832
I have a plate of cheese and grapes
for you in the icebox.

22:10.640 --> 22:12.233
How's she doing?

22:12.320 --> 22:14.038
She had a good day.

22:14.120 --> 22:16.589
And you, my dear,
have come at the perfect time.

22:16.680 --> 22:18.671
You need to wake her
so she can eat.

22:18.760 --> 22:20.159
I want you
to take this to her.

22:20.240 --> 22:21.639
I have homework.

22:21.720 --> 22:23.711
Oh, come on, Charlotte.
She had a good day.

22:23.800 --> 22:26.235
She's still going to die, Mr. Church.

22:37.480 --> 22:39.710
Hey, you're awake.

22:39.800 --> 22:42.155
I thought I heard Charlie.

22:42.240 --> 22:43.958
Did she come right up from school?

22:44.040 --> 22:45.314
Yeah, she's doing her homework.

22:45.400 --> 22:48.074
She didn't want to disturb you.

22:48.160 --> 22:51.232
You're a terrible liar, Mr. Church.

22:51.320 --> 22:53.755
You want some company?

23:06.760 --> 23:10.071
"She always accompanied him
to the first step of the stairs.

23:10.200 --> 23:12.191
"When his horse had not yet
been brought around...

23:12.280 --> 23:13.475
"she'd stayed there.

23:13.560 --> 23:16.074
"They had said good-bye.

23:16.160 --> 23:18.629
"There was no more talking.

23:18.720 --> 23:20.119
"The open air
wrapped around her...

23:20.200 --> 23:23.477
"playing with the soft down
on the back of her neck...

23:23.560 --> 23:25.153
"or blew to and fro on her hips...

23:25.240 --> 23:28.073
"the aprons strings
that fluttered like streamers.

23:28.160 --> 23:32.233
Love, she thought,
must come suddenly..."

23:32.320 --> 23:34.630
<i>My mama had been
the sun to me.</i>

23:34.720 --> 23:37.189
<i>I basked in her warmth.</i>

23:37.280 --> 23:40.796
<i>I remember wanting to wake up
in the morning just to see her.</i>

23:40.880 --> 23:42.598
<i>But now that sun was on fire...</i>

23:42.680 --> 23:46.150
<i>seemed to burn
everything in sight.</i>

23:46.240 --> 23:48.629
<i>If I got too close, my skin stung.</i>

23:49.600 --> 23:51.238
<i>But Mr. Church...</i>

23:51.320 --> 23:52.958
<i>he could walk
right through her blaze...</i>

23:53.040 --> 23:54.997
<i>without so much as a singe.</i>

23:55.120 --> 23:56.713
<i>He was like the moon...</i>

23:56.800 --> 23:59.918
<i>cool, calm, and always there.</i>

24:00.040 --> 24:02.714
<i>So, I learned to turn away
from the sun...</i>

24:02.800 --> 24:04.677
<i>and face the moon.</i>

24:11.320 --> 24:13.038
This is excellent work.

24:13.120 --> 24:15.839
The Bronte sisters
would have been proud.

24:19.880 --> 24:22.076
It was visiting day at the prison.

24:22.160 --> 24:23.833
I don't know why
they force Poppy to go.

24:23.920 --> 24:25.433
She just ends up smoking...

24:25.520 --> 24:27.511
with a bunch of locked-up creeps
staring at her.

24:27.600 --> 24:30.353
Hey, they're her parents, Charlotte.

24:32.840 --> 24:34.911
- Apple?
- Of course.

24:35.000 --> 24:36.229
Oh...

24:36.320 --> 24:37.993
Larson told me
to let you know...

24:38.120 --> 24:41.431
that his group of drunks
loved the pie you donated.

24:41.520 --> 24:43.431
Have you seen that place?

24:43.520 --> 24:45.113
The thing's pretty dreary.

24:45.200 --> 24:47.999
Well, I guess being a drunk
is dreary, huh?

24:50.680 --> 24:53.035
Hey, your mom's going to need
a bath tonight.

24:55.800 --> 24:58.269
<i>Mr. Church stopped smoking
in the house...</i>

24:58.360 --> 25:00.829
<i>once Mama passed
the six-month mark.</i>

25:00.920 --> 25:02.877
<i>Guess he realized
she wasn't going anywhere...</i>

25:02.960 --> 25:04.633
<i>and he didn't want
to hurry her along.</i>

25:11.680 --> 25:13.432
<i>We each had our duties.</i>

25:14.480 --> 25:15.834
<i>Mr. Church fed Mama...</i>

25:15.920 --> 25:18.196
<i>gave her medicine,
took her blood pressure...</i>

25:18.280 --> 25:21.159
<i>temperature, held pots
under her face when she threw up.</i>

25:21.240 --> 25:23.709
<i>Carried her to and from the bathroom
when she needed to go.</i>

25:23.800 --> 25:27.350
<i>And with all that,
he still called her ma'am.</i>

25:27.440 --> 25:30.239
<i>And she still called him
Mr. Church.</i>

25:31.560 --> 25:34.552
<i>My one and only job
was to bathe Mama.</i>

25:36.920 --> 25:38.513
<i>And I hated it.</i>

25:43.520 --> 25:45.989
How was--
How was school today?

25:46.080 --> 25:48.276
School is school.

25:48.400 --> 25:51.392
Did you-- Did you hear
from any more colleges?

25:52.760 --> 25:55.229
I got accepted
to Boston University.

25:55.320 --> 25:59.598
Charlie, that's what you wanted.

26:00.640 --> 26:01.675
I'm so proud of you.

26:01.760 --> 26:03.558
I can't afford a university, Mama.

26:03.640 --> 26:05.119
I'll be going local and you know it.

26:05.240 --> 26:07.038
You applied for a scholarship.

26:11.280 --> 26:15.877
Mr. Church said that Owen Baxter
asked you to the prom.

26:15.960 --> 26:17.871
News like that...

26:17.960 --> 26:20.520
I'd like to have heard it
from you.

26:20.640 --> 26:22.438
Forward.
It's no big deal.

26:22.520 --> 26:25.399
No big deal?

26:25.520 --> 26:27.113
Just a lame prom.

26:27.200 --> 26:30.750
No, baby, it's colorful and exciting.

26:30.840 --> 26:32.160
You get to see all your friends...

26:32.240 --> 26:33.833
dressed up...

26:33.920 --> 26:34.955
dancing with boys...

26:35.040 --> 26:36.394
they never even knew
liked them.

26:36.520 --> 26:39.353
Go back.
It's one of the biggest nights...

26:39.440 --> 26:42.193
of a girl's life.

26:42.280 --> 26:43.634
Thanks.

26:44.720 --> 26:47.792
- Frankie Liner.
- What?

26:47.880 --> 26:51.032
He was my--
my-- my prom date.

26:51.120 --> 26:54.715
Poor Frankie, his hands
were sweating all night long.

26:54.840 --> 26:57.992
But, boy, could he dance.

26:58.080 --> 26:59.878
You'll need a dress
and some new shoes.

26:59.960 --> 27:02.190
Not if I don't go.

27:02.280 --> 27:04.954
Charlie, don't skip your prom.

27:05.040 --> 27:07.509
Why do you care?
You won't be around to see it anyway.

27:07.600 --> 27:09.876
Don't say things like that.

27:11.960 --> 27:13.280
Okay?

27:13.400 --> 27:15.311
Because I...

27:15.400 --> 27:17.676
have hung on
for five years longer...

27:17.760 --> 27:19.876
than any of those
damn doctors said I would.

27:19.960 --> 27:22.713
What's a couple more weeks
till your prom?

27:22.800 --> 27:23.995
Neck.

27:24.120 --> 27:26.396
Charlie, listen to me, okay?

27:26.480 --> 27:28.869
I'm going to make you a promise...

27:29.000 --> 27:31.958
and you know
I never break my promises.

27:32.040 --> 27:35.351
If you say yes to Owen...

27:35.440 --> 27:37.272
and get yourself a dress...

27:38.280 --> 27:40.396
and you go
to that lame prom...

27:40.480 --> 27:43.393
I'll be here to see it.

27:47.360 --> 27:51.672
How'd we get such
beautiful hair, huh?

27:53.200 --> 27:54.952
Okay.

27:55.040 --> 27:56.189
We're done.

27:56.320 --> 27:57.196
- Charlie--
- We're done.

27:57.320 --> 27:58.879
- Mr. Church. Mr. Church.
- No, Charlie, wait!

27:58.960 --> 28:00.917
Goddamn it!

28:01.000 --> 28:03.389
I am angry too.

28:05.160 --> 28:07.436
You give birth to this tiny,
innocent, little thing...

28:07.520 --> 28:08.749
and you think, "My God...

28:08.840 --> 28:10.592
oh, my God,
help me protect her."

28:10.680 --> 28:13.991
And that is what you spend
every waking moment doing.

28:14.160 --> 28:17.994
And then one day you wake up
and you've got cancer.

28:18.080 --> 28:20.469
And you realize, "My God...

28:21.720 --> 28:23.154
"oh, my God...

28:28.440 --> 28:31.831
"what she will need
the most protection from...

28:31.920 --> 28:35.754
is your own life
slipping away from her."

28:37.000 --> 28:39.389
But you love her so much.

28:41.040 --> 28:44.078
And you just want
to smother her...

28:44.200 --> 28:47.591
with love and hugs and words...

28:47.680 --> 28:49.512
with every moment you've got left.

28:49.600 --> 28:51.671
And a hug there was.

28:51.760 --> 28:53.558
Charlie.

29:03.040 --> 29:04.155
Okay.

29:05.600 --> 29:09.992
She'll remember the love,
won't she, Mr. Church...

29:10.080 --> 29:10.911
not the pain?

29:11.000 --> 29:14.038
Yes, ma'am.
She will.

29:26.840 --> 29:29.639
<i>It's an awful feeling
to love someone so much...</i>

29:29.720 --> 29:33.634
<i>that you absolutely hate them
for leaving you.</i>

29:33.720 --> 29:36.234
<i>Even before they've gone.</i>

29:43.880 --> 29:47.191
Hey, Dr. Green stopped by
with some medicine for your mother...

29:47.280 --> 29:49.237
to help her sleep better tonight.

29:51.360 --> 29:52.555
You going home?

29:52.640 --> 29:55.280
Yup, I am gone for the day.

30:05.080 --> 30:07.549
Check out another book
before you go?

30:15.760 --> 30:17.910
<i>Tess of the a' 'Urbervi//es.
You</i> read <i>this?</i>

30:18.000 --> 30:21.311
Aren't you the one who said it's good
to read a book more than once?

30:21.400 --> 30:23.869
All right, well then,
Tess of the a' 'Urbervi//es it is.

30:26.640 --> 30:27.869
Is there something else?

30:29.080 --> 30:31.196
Why don't you ever
tell me where you live?

30:31.280 --> 30:32.873
Where do you go
when you aren't with us?

30:32.960 --> 30:34.439
Because what I do
with my own personal time...

30:34.560 --> 30:35.630
is my business, Charlotte.

30:35.720 --> 30:37.836
You know everything about me,
so just tell me something.

30:37.920 --> 30:39.433
It's late, Charlie.

30:39.520 --> 30:41.909
- Please.
- Hey, I said it's late.

30:48.600 --> 30:50.318
I like ice cream.

30:51.440 --> 30:53.192
What kind?

30:53.280 --> 30:55.032
Butter pecan.

30:55.120 --> 30:57.077
- Favorite color?
- Brown.

30:57.160 --> 30:58.309
Movie?

30:59.200 --> 31:01.794
<i>The Maltese Falcon.</i>

31:02.280 --> 31:04.590
- Do you have a girlfriend?
- Okay, now that's enough.

31:04.680 --> 31:06.751
All right, just tell me
what your house looks like.

31:06.840 --> 31:08.353
Or tell me
who your best friend is.

31:08.440 --> 31:11.193
- Come on, just tell me--
- Hey, I said enough!

31:11.280 --> 31:13.840
Don't you know
when to back off?

31:13.920 --> 31:15.274
Enough.

31:19.520 --> 31:21.750
You've never raised
your voice to me.

31:24.640 --> 31:26.074
I'm sorry about that.

31:26.160 --> 31:27.992
I just...

31:28.080 --> 31:29.400
I just want to know more
about you.

31:29.480 --> 31:32.598
I know you want.
I know.

31:32.680 --> 31:38.198
My dear, you have me
from morning until night.

31:38.280 --> 31:41.955
And what I do
when I leave here is my time.

31:42.040 --> 31:44.759
For me.

31:44.880 --> 31:46.678
Don't take that away.

31:51.240 --> 31:53.356
<i>Tess of the d'Urbervilles.</i>

31:53.440 --> 31:55.716
I've actually read it three times.

31:58.200 --> 31:59.713
Good night.

32:22.840 --> 32:24.672
That one.

32:24.760 --> 32:26.717
Yeah?

32:26.840 --> 32:28.319
Sure.

32:45.480 --> 32:47.278
Baby.

33:30.160 --> 33:32.913
L-- I think the neckline
could be a little lower.

33:33.000 --> 33:36.516
Well, she's going to a prom,
not the discotheque.

33:36.600 --> 33:39.513
Don't be such a square,
Mr. Church. Lower.

33:39.600 --> 33:41.477
<i>The prom suddenly became...</i>

33:41.560 --> 33:43.073
<i>the most important event
of our lives.</i>

33:43.160 --> 33:44.355
<i>And for the first time...</i>

33:44.440 --> 33:46.716
<i>I believed that Mama
was going to live forever...</i>

33:46.800 --> 33:49.030
<i>that she truly was a miracle.</i>

33:49.120 --> 33:51.396
<i>And those doctors
had been wrong all along.</i>

33:51.480 --> 33:53.676
Hey, you know,
this has an elegance to it...

33:53.800 --> 33:55.154
that this just doesn't have.

33:55.240 --> 33:56.310
This kind of says,
"Let's dance."

33:56.400 --> 33:57.993
Let's dance.
That's the point.

33:58.080 --> 33:59.718
- All right, it's your prom.
- The dancy look.

33:59.800 --> 34:02.076
- I like the dancy look.
- All right, we're going with the dancy look.

34:02.160 --> 34:03.195
Okay.

34:24.719 --> 34:26.393
Oh, my God.

34:26.520 --> 34:29.478
You are so beautiful.

34:29.560 --> 34:32.632
Tell her.
Tell her, Mr. Church.

34:32.719 --> 34:35.155
Oh, a true vision, my dear.

34:35.239 --> 34:37.708
The dress is perfect.

34:37.800 --> 34:40.268
Come and stand next to your mother
so I can get a picture.

34:40.360 --> 34:41.793
Well, put it on a timer.

34:41.880 --> 34:43.313
- We need a picture of the three of us.
- Yeah!

34:43.400 --> 34:44.833
- Oh, no, no, no.
- Come on now.

34:44.920 --> 34:45.830
Yeah, we do.

34:45.920 --> 34:47.797
- Please?
- We need one of the whole family.

34:47.880 --> 34:49.553
Mr. Church...

34:49.639 --> 34:52.074
Come on, sit.

34:52.159 --> 34:53.958
Okay.

35:05.200 --> 35:08.591
Okay, I want to make a toast.

35:14.320 --> 35:19.394
To the most beautiful girl
in the world.

35:20.560 --> 35:22.119
Yes.

35:26.440 --> 35:28.750
It pops in my mouth.

35:38.240 --> 35:40.231
- Come on in.
- Thanks.

35:44.440 --> 35:46.078
Wow.

35:46.160 --> 35:48.390
Hi.

36:09.240 --> 36:10.992
More punch?

36:11.080 --> 36:12.991
- Still have some.
- Right.

36:19.360 --> 36:21.556
Here's the thing.

36:21.640 --> 36:23.836
I can't dance.

36:23.920 --> 36:24.955
Not at all.

36:25.040 --> 36:27.839
That's okay.
We don't have to dance.

36:34.600 --> 36:36.637
Hell, it can't be harder
than basketball.

36:36.720 --> 36:37.949
Come on.

37:20.480 --> 37:22.471
You're still here.

37:22.560 --> 37:24.756
Oh, ma'am,
you shouldn't be up.

37:24.840 --> 37:25.989
I couldn't sleep.

37:26.080 --> 37:28.720
L-- I heard the music.

37:28.800 --> 37:30.757
I'm sorry.
I should have turned that down.

37:30.840 --> 37:32.990
No, I-- I like it. I...

37:34.600 --> 37:38.559
I was imagining Charlie
dancing in her dress.

37:44.880 --> 37:46.553
Do you dance, Mr. Church?

37:47.600 --> 37:49.159
There are those
who play music...

37:49.240 --> 37:50.674
and there are those
who dance to it.

37:50.760 --> 37:52.717
And the rare person
who does both.

37:55.560 --> 37:57.278
Why, I do believe
that is the first time...

37:57.360 --> 38:00.034
I have heard you compliment yourself.

38:06.240 --> 38:07.196
Dance with me.

38:08.200 --> 38:09.679
Ma'am?

38:11.520 --> 38:12.794
Come on. Now.

38:35.080 --> 38:37.993
I dare say
he speaks the truth.

38:48.320 --> 38:50.118
Okay, okay, <i>I</i> got you
<i>I</i> 90t you.

38:50.200 --> 38:52.840
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

38:52.920 --> 38:54.240
It's okay.

38:54.320 --> 38:58.996
Thank you.

38:59.080 --> 39:00.832
<i>L</i> got you.

39:41.240 --> 39:43.390
- Let me get that.
- Thanks.

39:47.160 --> 39:49.276
I'll get the gate.

39:57.400 --> 40:00.233
I had a really great time tonight.

40:00.360 --> 40:02.317
Me too.

40:11.000 --> 40:13.833
Good night, Charlie.

40:38.600 --> 40:40.352
So, tell me.

40:41.600 --> 40:43.318
Was it lame?

40:44.640 --> 40:47.758
No.

40:47.880 --> 40:49.518
It was...

40:51.480 --> 40:52.993
beautiful.

40:54.960 --> 40:56.473
You should be in bed.

40:56.560 --> 40:58.198
I wanted to wait up for you...

40:58.280 --> 41:00.271
just like every other mother...

41:00.360 --> 41:02.715
who waited up
for their daughter tonight.

41:04.760 --> 41:06.034
Did you dance?

41:06.120 --> 41:07.554
All night.

41:07.640 --> 41:09.313
Did he kiss you?

41:13.640 --> 41:18.271
Well, kisses come
in all sorts of ways, baby.

42:18.160 --> 42:21.516
<i>People act strange around death.</i>

42:21.640 --> 42:23.472
<i>There are those
who talk about everything...</i>

42:23.600 --> 42:24.795
<i>but the person who died.</i>

42:24.880 --> 42:28.191
And I told Mr. Rinaldo
that two pounds of meat was plenty...

42:28.280 --> 42:30.510
but he insisted on giving me three.

42:30.600 --> 42:32.034
And I said, "That's ridiculous..."

42:32.120 --> 42:34.430
<i>There are those who only talk
about the person who died.</i>

42:34.520 --> 42:36.591
Your mother was always
very nice to me.

42:36.680 --> 42:39.320
I thought she was pretty too.

42:39.400 --> 42:42.199
I always wondered why she didn't have
a boyfriend or something.

42:42.280 --> 42:44.840
<i>There are those who try
to cheer you up.</i>

42:44.920 --> 42:47.673
Your mother's at peace, Charlie.

42:47.760 --> 42:50.513
Out of pain.

42:50.600 --> 42:52.113
You don't want her in pain.

42:55.280 --> 42:58.238
<i>And those who can't help
but make you cry.</i>

42:58.920 --> 43:00.433
You know, I've always wished...

43:00.520 --> 43:02.750
I'd had a mom like yours, Charlie.

43:02.840 --> 43:05.514
Why can't it be
my mom who's dead...

43:05.600 --> 43:06.829
not yours?

43:09.800 --> 43:12.872
<i>And then there are those
who say nothing at all...</i>

43:21.320 --> 43:23.470
<i>because they don't have to.</i>

43:32.240 --> 43:33.992
<i>But when everyone was gone...</i>

43:34.080 --> 43:35.957
<i>the people and the noise
and the chatter...</i>

43:36.040 --> 43:37.758
<i>and the hospital bed...</i>

43:39.160 --> 43:41.515
<i>it was just Mr. Church and me.</i>

43:43.040 --> 43:44.713
<i>And I liked it.</i>

44:09.360 --> 44:13.479
<i>It was the first and only time
I ever saw Mr. Church cry.</i>

44:14.760 --> 44:16.876
<i>Even his weeping was graceful.</i>

44:20.040 --> 44:22.190
What's going to happen now?

44:23.240 --> 44:25.231
What will you do?

44:25.320 --> 44:27.755
Your job is done.

44:27.840 --> 44:30.150
I haven't even thought about it.

44:31.720 --> 44:34.758
Guess I'll start
thinking about it now.

44:40.800 --> 44:42.791
I have something for you.

44:44.400 --> 44:46.437
Actually, it's from your mother.

44:51.560 --> 44:53.676
I kept a record
of all the money I saved...

44:53.760 --> 44:56.036
marketing with those coupons
your mother gave me.

44:56.120 --> 44:58.634
I always did say they add up.

44:58.720 --> 45:00.438
I guess you can call
Boston University...

45:00.520 --> 45:03.353
and tell them that Charlotte Brooks
will be attending.

45:07.000 --> 45:08.718
All right.

45:11.680 --> 45:13.034
Okay, I guess you're going to...

45:13.120 --> 45:15.396
need a way to get there.

45:15.480 --> 45:16.629
'ZZZ

45:16.720 --> 45:19.394
always did hate riding the bus.

45:19.840 --> 45:22.309
<i>Mr. Church didn't have a license.</i>

45:22.400 --> 45:25.597
<i>So, I knew he couldn't teach me
how to drive.</i>

45:25.680 --> 45:28.638
<i>I went to the one person
who I knew could.</i>

45:30.000 --> 45:31.718
Okay.

45:33.480 --> 45:35.153
Just put the key
in the ignition, and--

45:39.840 --> 45:42.070
Put your foot on the clutch there.

45:42.160 --> 45:43.958
And when you give it gas...

45:44.040 --> 45:46.077
you're going to slowly release.

45:46.160 --> 45:47.514
- Foot off the brake.
- Okay.

45:47.640 --> 45:50.109
And on the accelerator.
Nice and easy.

45:51.800 --> 45:53.837
We're going. We're going.
There you go. Okay.

45:53.920 --> 45:55.069
Whoa, oh, oh!

45:55.160 --> 45:57.390
You have to take your foot
off the brake as well.

45:57.480 --> 45:59.391
Release the clutch slowly.

45:59.480 --> 46:01.391
- Are you okay?
- Put your foot on the clutch.

46:01.480 --> 46:02.834
- I-- Whoa, whoa, I'm sorry.
- Nice and slow.

46:02.920 --> 46:05.230
Oh! You okay? You okay?
You Okay?

46:05.320 --> 46:07.072
- Foot on the clutch.
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

46:07.200 --> 46:08.429
I'm sorry.
I swear I'll get it.

46:08.520 --> 46:09.840
It's okay.

46:12.240 --> 46:14.197
Good. Nice.
That's a good speed.

46:19.000 --> 46:21.116
Picking up speed.

46:27.760 --> 46:30.070
This is great.

46:30.160 --> 46:31.673
I did it.

46:48.800 --> 46:53.670
Until the twelfth of never...

46:53.760 --> 46:55.831
Charlie...

46:55.920 --> 46:59.197
You're going to be
a famous writer.

46:59.280 --> 47:00.076
Yeah.

47:00.160 --> 47:02.834
I'm going to be a famous
fashion designer.

47:02.920 --> 47:04.513
And all the duds in this town...

47:04.600 --> 47:05.795
they're going to say...

47:05.880 --> 47:09.396
"Oh, damn, aren't those the two
charity case girls from St. Frances?"

47:09.480 --> 47:10.879
- Well, I'll be damned.
- You're crazy!

47:10.960 --> 47:13.713
I'm not crazy.
What I am is free.

47:13.800 --> 47:18.078
New York, I am
on my way. Clear this.

47:18.160 --> 47:20.151
I'm completely lost.

47:20.240 --> 47:23.437
New York, New York, New York.

47:25.840 --> 47:29.720
Get us the hell out of here.
Bunch of lowlife drunks.

47:38.240 --> 47:39.878
<i>More than ever...</i>

47:40.000 --> 47:43.197
<i>I wanted to know everything
about Mr. Church.</i>

47:45.080 --> 47:46.912
Good night, Charlotte.

47:47.000 --> 47:49.196
Good night, Mr. Church.

47:51.960 --> 47:54.429
<i>I wanted to ask him
about Jelly's Place.</i>

47:54.520 --> 47:56.955
<i>Wanted him to know
he could tell me.</i>

47:57.760 --> 48:00.149
<i>I knew the rumors about Jelly's.</i>

48:06.920 --> 48:10.515
<i>Most of all, I wanted to know
Mr. Church was happy.</i>

48:10.600 --> 48:13.513
<i>With Mama gone
and me leaving for college...</i>

48:13.600 --> 48:15.477
<i>I worried about him.</i>

48:15.560 --> 48:17.153
<i>I thought if I could see his house...</i>

48:17.320 --> 48:19.994
<i>meet someone who loved him
as much as Mama and me...</i>

48:20.080 --> 48:23.038
<i>somehow I would know
he was okay.</i>

48:25.560 --> 48:28.074
Charlie?

48:28.160 --> 48:30.549
What are you doing
walking around alone at night?

48:33.840 --> 48:35.797
You want to jump in?

48:46.240 --> 48:49.312
Listen, have I done
something wrong?

48:50.400 --> 48:51.993
What?

48:52.120 --> 48:54.077
You've hardly spoken to me lately.

48:54.200 --> 48:55.793
Hell, you won't even
look at me.

48:59.920 --> 49:01.194
Why'd you take me to prom?

49:02.840 --> 49:04.239
What are you talking about?

49:04.320 --> 49:05.993
You could have asked
any girl in school.

49:06.080 --> 49:08.640
Popular girls,
girls with money.

49:08.720 --> 49:10.518
Why me?

49:10.600 --> 49:13.433
That's a dumb question.
I don't know, because I like you.

49:13.520 --> 49:14.590
Because you're smart.

49:14.720 --> 49:17.155
Or was it because
my mama was dying?

49:17.240 --> 49:18.150
What?

49:18.320 --> 49:21.199
If that's the reason, it's okay.

49:21.280 --> 49:22.839
L-- I get it.

49:22.920 --> 49:24.479
Poor Charlie Brooks.

49:24.560 --> 49:26.198
Poor fatherless,
soon to be motherless...

49:26.280 --> 49:27.873
- pathetic Charlie Brooks.
- Charlie--

49:27.960 --> 49:30.349
I get it.
Charity case.

49:30.440 --> 49:31.919
But let's just be honest about it.

49:32.000 --> 49:33.354
I mean, you never even kissed me.

49:33.440 --> 49:35.272
So, if the reason you took me
was out of pity--

49:52.440 --> 49:54.431
I don't pity you.

50:02.200 --> 50:07.229
I'm leaving tomorrow
for school, Charlie.

50:10.160 --> 50:13.039
My folks are driving me up early.

50:13.120 --> 50:15.839
That's why I came looking for you.

50:18.480 --> 50:20.357
To say good-bye-

50:24.640 --> 50:27.029
You study hard, Owen.

50:29.560 --> 50:32.313
You do something important
with your life, okay?

50:36.120 --> 50:37.793
Charlie...

50:47.640 --> 50:50.917
Never been to a restaurant
with you before, Mr. Church.

50:51.000 --> 50:52.911
Well, I figured since
it's your last night here...

50:53.000 --> 50:55.196
we should eat out.

50:55.320 --> 50:57.755
Sorry for the wait, folks.
What can I get you?

50:57.840 --> 50:59.911
Oh, um...

51:00.000 --> 51:01.320
Hey, do you have Apple Jacks?

51:01.400 --> 51:03.152
Comes in a box.

51:03.240 --> 51:05.629
Tastes mostly like sugar
and apples, mainly.

51:05.720 --> 51:07.870
- Yes, sir.
- I'll have that.

51:08.000 --> 51:10.469
Yeah, I'll have the same.

51:16.200 --> 51:20.080
And I suppose this is the last
of Richard's money...

51:20.160 --> 51:22.151
you'll ever spend on me.

51:22.240 --> 51:24.231
PoorfooL

51:24.320 --> 51:27.073
He thought he'd only have
to shell out enough for six months.

51:27.160 --> 51:28.719
Mama sure showed him.

51:35.520 --> 51:37.318
Mr. Church?

51:37.400 --> 51:39.630
Two Apple Jacks.

51:39.720 --> 51:41.518
Right on time.

51:41.600 --> 51:42.920
You're welcome. Enjoy.

51:43.000 --> 51:45.071
Oh, that looks wonderful.

51:45.160 --> 51:46.673
Yes.

51:57.760 --> 51:59.433
Apples and sugar.

51:59.520 --> 52:01.477
No secret there.

52:05.680 --> 52:07.751
<i>I took clothes and books.</i>

52:07.840 --> 52:09.399
<i>Nothing else.</i>

52:10.760 --> 52:13.479
<i>I told Mr. Church to take
whatever he wanted of Mama's...</i>

52:13.560 --> 52:15.836
<i>and whatever was left
to give to charity.</i>

53:27.880 --> 53:31.953
<i>I had driven 3,000 miles
to find out something amazing.</i>

53:32.120 --> 53:35.795
<i>Here, no one knew me
as poor Charlie Brooks.</i>

53:35.880 --> 53:38.394
<i>College was just how
I imagined it.</i>

53:38.480 --> 53:41.393
<i>Full of energy and color.</i>

53:41.640 --> 53:44.439
<i>Here, I could be anyone
I wanted to be.</i>

53:44.640 --> 53:49.157
And if we suppose that Shakespeare
instructed Thorpe to name...

53:49.240 --> 53:52.596
W.H. in the dedication, then...

53:52.680 --> 53:55.832
<i>I studied hard, and when
I felt too tired to keep going...</i>

53:55.960 --> 53:58.759
<i>I thought of all those damn coupons
Mom would cut to get me here...</i>

53:58.880 --> 54:00.075
<i>and it pushed me through.</i>

54:02.640 --> 54:05.553
All right, that's it.
No more studying.

54:05.640 --> 54:07.631
- No!
- No, we're going out.

54:08.120 --> 54:10.794
<i>Mr. Church wrote me every week.</i>

54:12.200 --> 54:14.350
<i>And always sent me books.</i>

54:19.880 --> 54:22.110
<i>Seasons changed.</i>

54:23.600 --> 54:25.477
<i>Roommates came and went.</i>

54:26.880 --> 54:28.518
<i>Class schedules changed...</i>

54:28.600 --> 54:32.878
<i>and I got closer every day
towards graduating.</i>

54:32.960 --> 54:35.349
<i>They say, for some,
college is the time of your life...</i>

54:35.440 --> 54:37.829
<i>where you find yourself.</i>

54:39.920 --> 54:41.274
<i>And for others...</i>

54:41.360 --> 54:42.998
Hey, how you doing?
Hey, I'm Charlie.

54:43.080 --> 54:43.990
Nice to meet you.

54:44.080 --> 54:45.434
<i>...it can also be a time...</i>

54:45.520 --> 54:47.511
<i>where you slowly get lost.</i>

54:52.120 --> 54:54.509
<i>And sometimes...</i>

54:56.000 --> 54:57.559
<i>you just have to go home.</i>

54:58.640 --> 55:00.233
<i>Wherever that may be.</i>

55:00.320 --> 55:02.072
Hi.

55:02.160 --> 55:04.037
It's Charlie.

55:23.080 --> 55:24.036
Surprise.

55:25.720 --> 55:28.109
<i>Seems the legacy
of the Brooks family...</i>

55:28.200 --> 55:30.874
<i>was having babies
out of wedlock.</i>

55:42.520 --> 55:47.594
Sorry I stopped
writing you, Mr. Church.

55:47.680 --> 55:49.637
You know, I stopped
writing Poppy too.

55:49.720 --> 55:52.997
Things-- Things just got
a little crazy for me.

55:53.120 --> 55:54.793
I can see that.

55:55.680 --> 55:57.398
But I read all your letters...

55:57.480 --> 55:59.835
sometimes even twice a day.

56:01.040 --> 56:03.680
Anyway, I needed
a break and I thought...

56:03.760 --> 56:06.115
"Go surprise Mr. Church."

56:06.200 --> 56:08.953
Yeah, well, you really surprised me.

56:12.600 --> 56:14.910
Can I stay for a few days?

56:15.000 --> 56:16.673
I mean,
I brought my books.

56:16.760 --> 56:18.080
I can study here and everything.

56:18.160 --> 56:21.232
I just need a place to rest.

56:25.640 --> 56:29.315
Okay. I got one rule.

56:29.400 --> 56:31.198
You respect my privacy.

56:31.280 --> 56:32.759
'Cause you're in my house now, right?

56:32.840 --> 56:35.116
Yeah, okay.
I will.

56:35.200 --> 56:35.996
Okay.

56:36.120 --> 56:38.191
<i>It was like we were never apart.</i>

56:38.280 --> 56:39.156
All right, then.

56:39.240 --> 56:42.676
<i>He never asked a single question
about my being pregnant.</i>

56:42.760 --> 56:45.354
Still smoking outside, Mr. Church?

56:47.160 --> 56:48.355
Yeah, as of today.

56:48.440 --> 56:51.114
<i>I guess Mr. Church
respected my privacy...</i>

56:51.200 --> 56:53.999
<i>as much as he asked me
to respect his.</i>

56:54.080 --> 56:56.640
<i>All I knew being back with Mr. Church...</i>

56:56.720 --> 56:58.119
<i>was that I was home.</i>

57:09.880 --> 57:12.520
<i>All those years wondering
where Mr. Church lived...</i>

57:12.600 --> 57:15.035
<i>and I was now standing
in the center of it.</i>

57:15.160 --> 57:16.753
Try this.

57:24.560 --> 57:26.790
- Licorice?
- That's right.

57:39.600 --> 57:40.795
Hey, I brought an extra blanket.

57:40.880 --> 57:42.712
It gets cold in here
at night sometimes.

57:42.800 --> 57:44.996
And the sun shines
in that window really bright.

57:45.080 --> 57:47.196
You might want
to close that curtain.

57:48.280 --> 57:50.032
Is this you?

57:51.440 --> 57:53.158
I'm sorry. I wasn't snooping.

57:53.280 --> 57:54.679
I just found it in the drawer.

57:54.760 --> 57:56.831
Yeah, that's me and my father.

57:58.320 --> 57:59.276
You look like him.

58:03.480 --> 58:04.800
I'm going to leave the light on...

58:04.880 --> 58:06.075
for you out here
in case you want to get...

58:06.160 --> 58:07.275
some milk
or something at night.

58:07.360 --> 58:08.555
Good night, my dear.

58:08.640 --> 58:10.039
Good night, Mr. Church.

58:33.720 --> 58:37.270
You can't change me, old man!

58:39.360 --> 58:40.873
You're not changing shit!

58:42.520 --> 58:44.875
Oh, I'm a sinner?
Yeah, that's right!

58:45.000 --> 58:46.513
I'm a sinner!

58:50.200 --> 58:53.158
Who's a faggot?
You the goddamn faggot.

58:54.360 --> 58:56.192
Talking the shit.

59:05.880 --> 59:08.474
Kick your ass, old man.

59:08.560 --> 59:10.676
Shit, I ain't no kid no more.

59:15.360 --> 59:19.240
You don't tell me a goddamn thing!

59:23.240 --> 59:25.709
<i>I took the book of matches
from Jelly's...</i>

59:25.800 --> 59:27.199
<i>because I knew
he'd be embarrassed...</i>

59:27.280 --> 59:29.112
<i>if he saw that I'd found it.</i>

59:29.200 --> 59:32.750
<i>And come morning,
there was Mr. Church making breakfast...</i>

59:32.880 --> 59:35.156
<i>smelling like soap and seasonings...</i>

59:35.240 --> 59:36.514
<i>listening to his music.</i>

59:36.600 --> 59:38.716
Hey, you're awake.

59:38.800 --> 59:40.677
The baby's got to eat.

59:41.960 --> 59:44.031
How was your night, Mr. Church?

59:44.120 --> 59:46.157
It was pleasant enough.

59:46.240 --> 59:48.754
<i>And that's all he would ever say.</i>

59:48.840 --> 59:50.513
<i>Pleasant enough.</i>

59:57.280 --> 01:00:00.511
Those are the only keys
I never quite got the hang of.

01:00:00.600 --> 01:00:03.399
About time I let somebody else
try to play them.

01:00:04.880 --> 01:00:07.440
Your thesis awaits, my dear.

01:00:07.520 --> 01:00:10.319
Start with the first word
and the rest will follow.

01:01:25.560 --> 01:01:28.120
- Hey, what are you doing?
- Oh, I'm-- I was just--

01:01:28.200 --> 01:01:29.918
- Okay, now you got to go.
- Mr. Church--

01:01:30.040 --> 01:01:31.599
- Let's go, right now!
- I'm-- I'm sorry.

01:01:31.680 --> 01:01:33.478
- I'm sorry.
- I give you one goddamn rule...

01:01:33.560 --> 01:01:34.914
- and you break it, right?
- I'm sorry!

01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:36.149
You get out of my shit right now.

01:01:36.240 --> 01:01:37.878
- Pack your shit and go!
- You're hurting me!

01:01:37.960 --> 01:01:39.394
- Just get out!
- Where am I supposed to go?

01:01:39.480 --> 01:01:40.515
It's the middle of the night.

01:01:40.600 --> 01:01:42.273
That's not my goddamn problem.

01:01:43.240 --> 01:01:46.232
I'm not a child anymore, Mr. Church!

01:01:48.080 --> 01:01:50.959
Or are you too drunk to see that?

01:01:51.040 --> 01:01:52.360
What is it with all of you?

01:01:52.440 --> 01:01:55.592
The secrets and lies
and more secrets?

01:01:55.680 --> 01:01:57.114
Don't tell Charlie I'm dying.

01:01:57.200 --> 01:01:59.953
Don't tell Charlie a goddamn thing.

01:02:00.040 --> 01:02:02.839
I just wanted to know you, Mr. Church.

01:02:02.920 --> 01:02:04.240
Look, I was your cook.

01:02:04.320 --> 01:02:05.833
That's all you need to know.

01:02:23.880 --> 01:02:25.837
<i>I had nowhere to go.</i>

01:02:25.920 --> 01:02:28.514
<i>And for the first time...</i>

01:02:28.640 --> 01:02:30.870
<i>I realized I had no one.</i>

01:03:11.440 --> 01:03:13.272
Larson?

01:03:13.360 --> 01:03:14.998
Larson!

01:03:17.360 --> 01:03:19.749
Hey, Charlie.

01:03:19.840 --> 01:03:21.751
Look at you, you're all...

01:03:21.840 --> 01:03:22.910
pregnant and married.

01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:25.992
Oh, no.
Just-- Just pregnant.

01:03:27.920 --> 01:03:29.513
Well, you living
out here again?

01:03:29.600 --> 01:03:31.910
No, still in college.

01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:33.832
Just, you know, came to see--...

01:03:33.920 --> 01:03:35.911
Came to visit.

01:03:36.040 --> 01:03:37.917
Heading back tonight.

01:03:40.280 --> 01:03:41.679
You still got that car, or...

01:03:41.760 --> 01:03:44.479
Oh, it's good.
It's right over there.

01:03:44.560 --> 01:03:45.789
Yeah.

01:03:45.880 --> 01:03:47.757
Do you need a ride somewhere?

01:03:47.840 --> 01:03:49.513
Oh, no, no, no.

01:03:49.600 --> 01:03:50.795
No, I...

01:03:50.880 --> 01:03:53.918
I'd better get a...

01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:56.879
Hey, it was good--
Good seeing you, though.

01:03:56.960 --> 01:03:59.315
Yeah, you too, Larson.

01:04:10.960 --> 01:04:12.598
Oh, shit!

01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:24.799
I swear to God, dude,
I didn't even see her.

01:04:24.920 --> 01:04:26.354
Charlotte, come here.

01:04:28.680 --> 01:04:30.910
Here, get the door.

01:05:15.200 --> 01:05:17.157
Breathe, Charlie, breathe.

01:05:32.840 --> 01:05:34.877
<i>I heard the doctors and nurses...</i>

01:05:35.080 --> 01:05:37.799
<i>whispering i2' was a miracle
the baby didn '2' die.</i>

01:05:37.880 --> 01:05:39.473
<i>I wanted to tell them...</i>

01:05:39.560 --> 01:05:41.119
<i>"Don't you know?</i>

01:05:41.200 --> 01:05:43.271
<i>Miracles run in the Brooks family."</i>

01:05:43.360 --> 01:05:46.716
You need to be very careful.
Lots of rest, Charlie.

01:05:46.800 --> 01:05:48.120
Do you have a place to stay?

01:05:48.200 --> 01:05:49.031
She lives with me.

01:05:51.560 --> 01:05:52.550
You are?

01:05:52.640 --> 01:05:54.790
I'm Mr. Church.

01:05:56.840 --> 01:05:58.638
Are you responsible for Charlie?

01:06:05.760 --> 01:06:07.273
Yeah.

01:06:17.080 --> 01:06:19.959
<i>The baby gave Mr. Church
a sense of purpose and excitement.</i>

01:06:20.080 --> 01:06:22.754
Oh! There she goes again.

01:06:22.840 --> 01:06:24.672
"She," Mr. Church?

01:06:24.760 --> 01:06:27.149
Well, it's a guess.
She feels like-- I'm feeling she.

01:06:32.800 --> 01:06:35.474
Aren't you going to ask me
how it happened?

01:06:35.560 --> 01:06:39.155
I know how girls
get pregnant, Charlotte.

01:06:39.960 --> 01:06:41.917
<i>If he wasn't gardening...</i>

01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:43.320
<i>he was painting.</i>

01:06:43.400 --> 01:06:44.515
<i>If he wasn't painting...</i>

01:06:44.600 --> 01:06:46.876
<i>he was cooking.</i>

01:06:46.960 --> 01:06:48.189
<i>If he wasn't cooking...</i>

01:06:48.280 --> 01:06:50.556
<i>he was playing the piano.</i>

01:06:56.240 --> 01:06:58.231
<i>And if he wasn't playing
the piano...</i>

01:06:58.320 --> 01:07:00.596
<i>he was reading to me.</i>

01:07:00.680 --> 01:07:01.954
Bonnie?

01:07:02.080 --> 01:07:03.673
Too cute.

01:07:03.760 --> 01:07:05.239
Brenda?

01:07:05.320 --> 01:07:08.039
Too dangerous.

01:07:08.120 --> 01:07:09.315
Beth?

01:07:09.400 --> 01:07:10.959
Too simple.

01:07:11.040 --> 01:07:12.394
How about Carrie?

01:07:14.320 --> 01:07:15.754
No.

01:07:20.760 --> 01:07:23.354
<i>Every Wednesday
and Saturday night...</i>

01:07:23.440 --> 01:07:25.158
<i>Mr. Church went out.</i>

01:07:25.240 --> 01:07:27.151
Good night, Charlotte.

01:07:27.240 --> 01:07:30.278
<i>He never said
where he was going.</i>

01:07:30.400 --> 01:07:32.914
<i>And I never asked.</i>

01:07:35.960 --> 01:07:37.837
<i>But I knew.</i>

01:07:37.920 --> 01:07:40.514
You have Irene.
Or Iris.

01:07:40.600 --> 01:07:41.999
Irma...

01:07:42.120 --> 01:07:43.474
Mr. Church?

01:07:43.560 --> 01:07:44.994
- Irma sound like an old lady.
- Mr. Church?

01:07:45.120 --> 01:07:46.838
- Mr. Church?
-lsabeL

01:07:46.920 --> 01:07:48.638
Isabel. What do you think
of Isabel?

01:07:48.720 --> 01:07:51.792
Mr. Church...oh, my God.
Oh, my God, we got to go.

01:07:51.920 --> 01:07:53.194
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

01:07:53.280 --> 01:07:54.634
Okay, okay, okay, Okay-

01:07:54.720 --> 01:07:56.233
I'll call right now.

01:08:15.440 --> 01:08:17.511
<i>Mr. Church was right.</i>

01:08:17.600 --> 01:08:19.398
<i>I was having a baby girl.</i>

01:08:19.479 --> 01:08:21.470
She's going to need
a name, Charlotte.

01:08:26.359 --> 01:08:27.714
IsabeL

01:08:27.800 --> 01:08:29.711
Isabel Marie Brooks.

01:08:31.040 --> 01:08:32.599
Hey.

01:08:32.680 --> 01:08:34.273
Hey, Isabel.

01:08:34.359 --> 01:08:36.590
I'm Mr. Church.

01:08:45.200 --> 01:08:47.191
<i>Everything was about Izzy.</i>

01:08:49.040 --> 01:08:51.270
We're going to go right...

01:08:57.560 --> 01:09:01.234
<i>Getting that degree seemed
to slip farther and farther away.</i>

01:09:01.319 --> 01:09:02.754
<i>And after a while...</i>

01:09:02.840 --> 01:09:05.719
<i>Mr. Church stopped
asking me about it.</i>

01:09:05.800 --> 01:09:07.473
<i>I was a mother.</i>

01:09:07.560 --> 01:09:08.959
<i>And Mr. Church...</i>

01:09:09.080 --> 01:09:10.877
My Izzy...

01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:13.354
<i>he was everything else.</i>

01:09:16.760 --> 01:09:19.912
It's okay.
It's okay.

01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:22.071
Izzy...

01:09:22.160 --> 01:09:23.877
<i>Yea»</i>

01:09:27.479 --> 01:09:29.232
Mr. Church,
dance with me.

01:09:29.319 --> 01:09:30.957
Okay, I will in a second.
Just hold still.

01:09:31.040 --> 01:09:32.837
I'm almost finished.
Oh, come on.

01:09:32.920 --> 01:09:34.593
Come on now...
Hey, come on.

01:09:34.680 --> 01:09:36.591
- We're going to be late.
- Mama, dance with me.

01:09:36.680 --> 01:09:38.238
No, not now.
We got to go, baby.

01:09:38.359 --> 01:09:39.953
- Come on, come on.
- Mama, dance with me.

01:09:40.040 --> 01:09:42.077
- Let's go, let's go.
- Oh! Okay.

01:09:42.160 --> 01:09:44.595
One dance, I guess.

01:09:44.680 --> 01:09:46.511
Mr. Church...

01:09:46.600 --> 01:09:48.671
Come on, Mr. Church.
One dance.

01:09:58.360 --> 01:09:59.759
Charlie?

01:10:01.560 --> 01:10:03.517
It's crazy, right?

01:10:03.600 --> 01:10:05.671
It's wonderful.
Congratulations.

01:10:05.760 --> 01:10:07.478
Thank you so much
for coming out.

01:10:07.560 --> 01:10:11.235
<i>Larson fell in love with e gel he met
at one of his AA meetings.</i>

01:10:15.200 --> 01:10:18.318
You know, she wouldn't be here
if it weren't for you.

01:10:18.440 --> 01:10:19.953
No, she's beautiful.

01:10:22.640 --> 01:10:25.359
I like that dress.
Did you make that?

01:10:25.440 --> 01:10:28.796
You know, there's something
I never told you about that day.

01:10:31.160 --> 01:10:32.639
I'd scraped up enough cash...

01:10:32.720 --> 01:10:35.394
to buy a bottle of Jack
and some pills, and...

01:10:37.720 --> 01:10:39.597
I was just going to go home
and check out for good.

01:10:39.680 --> 01:10:41.830
You know?

01:10:41.920 --> 01:10:44.150
And then you fell.

01:10:47.400 --> 01:10:50.392
You know, you always say
that I saved lzzy's life...

01:10:50.480 --> 01:10:55.111
but the truth is
that both of you saved mine.

01:11:00.760 --> 01:11:02.717
Don't you think
my mom's pretty?

01:11:02.800 --> 01:11:04.711
I think she's beautiful.

01:11:06.320 --> 01:11:08.357
Well, I guess I'd better go
dance with my wife.

01:11:08.440 --> 01:11:09.669
Yeah!

01:11:19.760 --> 01:11:21.080
Hey, there you go.

01:11:21.160 --> 01:11:23.151
Oh, thank you.

01:11:24.880 --> 01:11:26.871
Do you ever want
to get married, Mr. Church?

01:11:27.880 --> 01:11:29.598
I'm sorry.

01:11:29.720 --> 01:11:31.358
That's none of my business.

01:11:31.440 --> 01:11:33.636
I was married before.

01:11:35.520 --> 01:11:36.919
Yes, I was married before.

01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:39.037
A long time ago.
I was very young.

01:11:39.120 --> 01:11:41.031
I got married
because my father...

01:11:41.120 --> 01:11:43.270
wanted me to get married,
but it didn't last very long.

01:11:43.400 --> 01:11:44.629
I wasn't very good at it.

01:11:44.720 --> 01:11:46.757
She was a very lovely lady, though.

01:11:46.840 --> 01:11:48.877
I guess I just wasn't
what she was looking for.

01:11:50.520 --> 01:11:53.034
Any man and woman
can get married, Charlotte.

01:11:59.640 --> 01:12:01.711
Mr. Church...

01:12:01.800 --> 01:12:03.313
do you want to dance?

01:12:26.160 --> 01:12:29.516
Last time I danced like this
was prom night.

01:12:30.720 --> 01:12:32.711
Me too.

01:12:49.040 --> 01:12:51.111
Thanks.

01:12:51.200 --> 01:12:53.111
Be with you in a second, sir.

01:12:53.200 --> 01:12:54.634
- Hey.
- Hi, Mama.

01:12:54.720 --> 01:12:56.358
Hi, baby.

01:12:56.440 --> 01:12:57.839
What are you two doing here?

01:12:57.920 --> 01:12:59.433
Found something for you.

01:12:59.560 --> 01:13:01.039
What...

01:13:05.200 --> 01:13:06.838
You found her.

01:13:06.920 --> 01:13:08.877
I found her.

01:13:14.240 --> 01:13:15.389
Mama, look.

01:13:19.920 --> 01:13:21.354
Thank you.

01:13:21.440 --> 01:13:23.511
Oh, my God!
Charlie!

01:13:23.600 --> 01:13:24.999
Poppy!

01:13:25.080 --> 01:13:26.559
You look so glamorous.

01:13:26.680 --> 01:13:29.069
So gorgeous.

01:13:31.440 --> 01:13:33.636
- This is Izzy.
- Hello.

01:13:33.760 --> 01:13:35.194
Mr. Church.

01:13:35.280 --> 01:13:36.839
Hey, POPPY-

01:13:36.920 --> 01:13:38.991
You're the spitting image
of your grandma.

01:13:39.080 --> 01:13:40.559
You knew my grandmother?

01:13:40.640 --> 01:13:42.199
She was only the most
beautiful woman...

01:13:42.280 --> 01:13:43.395
I've seen in my whole life.

01:13:43.520 --> 01:13:45.955
That's what Mom always says.

01:13:47.240 --> 01:13:49.834
- Aren't you pretty?
- Is that a real diamond?

01:13:49.920 --> 01:13:53.231
Oh, honey, you ain't seen
nothing yet.

01:13:53.320 --> 01:13:56.756
Come on, get in.
Let's get out of this neighborhood.

01:13:56.840 --> 01:13:58.877
Bye, Mr. Church.

01:13:58.960 --> 01:14:00.359
Have fun, my dear.

01:14:04.160 --> 01:14:06.037
Bye, Mr. Church!

01:14:12.160 --> 01:14:14.879
Didn't I tell you I'd get out
of this stinking town?

01:14:14.960 --> 01:14:17.554
New York City's so exciting.

01:14:17.680 --> 01:14:19.751
This one was Fifth Avenue.

01:14:19.840 --> 01:14:21.274
Super-smart Charlie...

01:14:21.360 --> 01:14:23.192
it's a place for someone
like you who reads.

01:14:23.280 --> 01:14:25.032
Well, you certainly married well.

01:14:25.120 --> 01:14:26.349
I married well both times.

01:14:28.040 --> 01:14:30.111
Here, let me show you
the good stuff.

01:14:30.200 --> 01:14:33.158
Look at this.
Look at the beading.

01:14:34.960 --> 01:14:37.076
L-- I heard your parents were out.

01:14:37.200 --> 01:14:38.713
Living up north somewhere?

01:14:38.800 --> 01:14:40.632
I wouldn't know.

01:14:40.720 --> 01:14:42.358
Oh, I--
I just figured...

01:14:42.440 --> 01:14:44.556
you stayed in touch with your sister.

01:14:44.640 --> 01:14:46.233
My family's gone, Charlie.

01:14:46.320 --> 01:14:48.755
Let's not talk of them again.
Look at this one.

01:14:48.880 --> 01:14:51.554
It's a birthday gift. Parisian.

01:14:51.640 --> 01:14:53.631
- Yeah.
- Feel it.

01:14:55.160 --> 01:14:57.959
Isn't that fabric wonderful?

01:14:58.040 --> 01:14:59.917
Amazing.

01:15:07.160 --> 01:15:10.073
Aunt Poppy plans
to spoil you rotten.

01:15:10.160 --> 01:15:12.470
These stores are expensive.

01:15:12.560 --> 01:15:14.676
Let me.
I'll never have a child of my own.

01:15:14.760 --> 01:15:16.080
You don't know that.

01:15:16.160 --> 01:15:18.231
No, I do.
I could have at one time.

01:15:18.320 --> 01:15:21.358
I've got all the scars to prove it.

01:15:21.440 --> 01:15:24.159
You should see where
I shop in Manhattan.

01:15:24.240 --> 01:15:26.277
Are you happy?

01:15:26.360 --> 01:15:28.954
I have everything I want.

01:15:29.040 --> 01:15:33.034
So, you know, no boyfriend,
no romance in your life?

01:15:33.120 --> 01:15:35.031
Single moms aren't exactly popular.

01:15:35.120 --> 01:15:37.111
- I've known that my whole life.
- Come to New York with me.

01:15:37.200 --> 01:15:39.589
- I could fix you up with a bunch of fine men.
- What? No.

01:15:39.720 --> 01:15:42.633
Yeah. You would love it.
Izzy would love it.

01:15:42.720 --> 01:15:44.791
I can get her into any private school
you want.

01:15:44.880 --> 01:15:46.109
That's not going to happen.

01:15:46.200 --> 01:15:47.793
I know a few bachelors who would--

01:15:47.880 --> 01:15:49.996
I mean, they're no Owen Baxter,
but they have money.

01:15:50.080 --> 01:15:52.276
I don't need money.
Baby, don't go too far.

01:15:54.040 --> 01:15:56.475
I have a job.
I make a paycheck.

01:15:56.560 --> 01:15:58.153
Waiting tables.
I'm not ashamed.

01:15:58.280 --> 01:16:00.351
No, come on, Charlie.
Don't be so stubborn.

01:16:00.440 --> 01:16:01.839
You don't have anything here.

01:16:01.920 --> 01:16:03.638
You can't go living
with your cook forever.

01:16:03.720 --> 01:16:05.154
MY Cook?

01:16:05.240 --> 01:16:07.072
Oh, you know what I mean.

01:16:07.160 --> 01:16:10.152
What happened to you, Poppy?

01:16:10.240 --> 01:16:11.753
You used to be a lot of things...

01:16:11.840 --> 01:16:13.035
but you were never a snob.

01:16:13.120 --> 01:16:16.317
- Charlie...
- You want to know something about my cook?

01:16:16.400 --> 01:16:19.756
Richard set aside enough money
for Mama to live six months.

01:16:19.840 --> 01:16:21.831
Six months.

01:16:21.920 --> 01:16:24.355
And do you know who paid
all of our bills, food, and rent...

01:16:24.440 --> 01:16:25.794
all those years after that?

01:16:27.240 --> 01:16:30.392
Mr. Church didn't work for us.

01:16:30.520 --> 01:16:33.034
He saved us.

01:16:33.120 --> 01:16:35.509
Now, I may not have some fancy life...

01:16:35.600 --> 01:16:38.718
but I work hard
and I'm raising my baby.

01:16:38.800 --> 01:16:41.269
She's my diamond, Poppy.

01:16:41.360 --> 01:16:43.351
I'm sorry if it doesn't
sparkle enough for you.

01:16:44.840 --> 01:16:46.433
Come on, baby.
We're going to go home.

01:16:52.360 --> 01:16:55.990
And let's put the rocking chair
up there.

01:17:00.960 --> 01:17:02.712
And...

01:17:04.800 --> 01:17:07.269
Well, she shouldn't have
bought it.

01:17:07.360 --> 01:17:09.078
I'll return it tomorrow.

01:17:09.160 --> 01:17:11.117
I don't think you should
punish the child...

01:17:11.200 --> 01:17:13.555
because you and Poppy fought.

01:17:13.640 --> 01:17:16.393
And you still ain't opened
the gift she left for you.

01:17:16.480 --> 01:17:18.073
Well...

01:17:18.160 --> 01:17:21.232
whatever you two argued about...

01:17:22.320 --> 01:17:23.310
forgive her.

01:17:24.800 --> 01:17:28.156
You should go into the attic.

01:17:32.040 --> 01:17:34.316
This little girl should go inside...

01:17:35.880 --> 01:17:38.872
This is your room
and that's your room.

01:18:07.880 --> 01:18:10.190
I see you don't approve, huh?

01:18:11.720 --> 01:18:14.439
Well, I'm living my own life!

01:18:20.600 --> 01:18:22.637
Goddamn...

01:18:22.760 --> 01:18:25.036
You go ahead and kick me
out of the house, old man.

01:18:25.120 --> 01:18:26.793
Go ahead.

01:18:29.080 --> 01:18:30.798
I don't give a shit.

01:18:32.200 --> 01:18:34.874
Your rules? Fine!

01:18:40.560 --> 01:18:43.837
Oh...just said that--
I don't know, shit.

01:18:43.920 --> 01:18:45.354
Mr. Church.

01:18:45.440 --> 01:18:48.159
Hey, get your goddamn hands off me.

01:18:48.240 --> 01:18:49.878
I'm not drunk.

01:18:50.920 --> 01:18:52.718
I'm not drunk.

01:18:54.080 --> 01:18:55.991
You can't disown nobody, old man.

01:18:56.080 --> 01:18:57.479
I disown you.

01:18:57.560 --> 01:18:59.233
Shit.

01:18:59.320 --> 01:19:01.914
We ain't in church no more.

01:19:03.560 --> 01:19:07.997
The wise son seeketh
the father's instruction...

01:19:08.080 --> 01:19:11.596
but the scorner
heareth not rebuke.

01:19:15.160 --> 01:19:17.720
I don't give a shit.

01:19:37.320 --> 01:19:39.197
How was your night, Mr. Church?

01:19:39.280 --> 01:19:40.953
It was pleasant enough.

01:19:41.040 --> 01:19:42.360
Hey, put some spice in here.

01:19:42.440 --> 01:19:43.953
And watch out.
The pan is hot.

01:19:45.600 --> 01:19:47.432
Now watch out for that pan.

01:19:47.520 --> 01:19:49.431
Very good.

01:19:54.320 --> 01:19:58.473
<i>It was the first time
the matches were left on the table.</i>

01:19:58.560 --> 01:20:02.440
<i>Now Mr. Church realized
that I knew about Jelly's.</i>

01:20:02.520 --> 01:20:04.955
<i>Probably that
I'd always known.</i>

01:20:07.040 --> 01:20:09.316
<i>The matchbook stayed
on the table all that day...</i>

01:20:09.400 --> 01:20:10.913
<i>and into the next.</i>

01:20:11.000 --> 01:20:13.230
<i>But it would be the last.</i>

01:20:13.320 --> 01:20:16.950
<i>Mr. Church never came home
drunk again.</i>

01:20:29.640 --> 01:20:31.551
You still got that cough, Mr. Church.

01:20:31.680 --> 01:20:33.671
It's only a cough, my dear.

01:20:33.760 --> 01:20:35.398
Okay, well, that's it.
No more fighting me.

01:20:35.480 --> 01:20:38.359
We're getting you looked at.

01:20:40.000 --> 01:20:41.832
I don't need a doctor.
It's the flu.

01:20:46.040 --> 01:20:47.519
Mr. Church.

01:20:47.600 --> 01:20:49.352
Izzy, give me your book, please.

01:20:49.440 --> 01:20:51.636
Thank you.
All right.

01:20:53.440 --> 01:20:56.080
Hello, Mr. Church.

01:20:59.280 --> 01:21:00.679
Owen.

01:21:01.720 --> 01:21:03.040
Charlie.

01:21:04.280 --> 01:21:07.033
Maybe I will stay.

01:21:07.120 --> 01:21:09.316
Oh, my God.

01:21:09.400 --> 01:21:12.153
Owen, this is my daughter, Izzy.

01:21:12.240 --> 01:21:13.514
Hello.

01:21:13.600 --> 01:21:16.638
Can you fix Mr. Church's cough?

01:21:18.040 --> 01:21:20.350
I will certainly give it my all.

01:21:24.640 --> 01:21:27.029
You know, maybe I shouldn't go.

01:21:27.120 --> 01:21:28.838
You're still sick.

01:21:28.920 --> 01:21:30.479
I'm fine.

01:21:30.560 --> 01:21:33.632
And I know where to find
a doctor if I need one.

01:21:40.640 --> 01:21:42.551
Well?

01:21:42.640 --> 01:21:44.711
You're so beautiful, Mama.

01:21:46.320 --> 01:21:48.391
Mr. Church, tell her.

01:21:51.920 --> 01:21:53.752
True vision, my dear.

01:21:57.000 --> 01:22:00.197
So, Owen Baxter became a doctor.

01:22:00.280 --> 01:22:03.910
You're the one who told me
to do something good with my life.

01:22:04.000 --> 01:22:05.229
I thought by now...

01:22:05.320 --> 01:22:07.880
you'd be a very serious novelist...

01:22:07.960 --> 01:22:09.997
living in Boston.

01:22:10.080 --> 01:22:13.516
I guess life
had other plans for me.

01:22:20.920 --> 01:22:22.479
Izzy?

01:22:22.560 --> 01:22:24.471
Izzy.

01:22:26.280 --> 01:22:28.590
Tell me about her father.

01:22:31.960 --> 01:22:33.792
Did you love him?

01:22:36.200 --> 01:22:39.113
It was just a foolish night.

01:22:39.200 --> 01:22:44.070
Guess you could say I was
a little lost after Mama died.

01:22:44.160 --> 01:22:46.959
He didn't want to have
anything to do with the baby.

01:22:48.480 --> 01:22:50.630
But he gave me
the greatest gift.

01:22:55.000 --> 01:22:57.719
I tried finding you for a few years.

01:22:57.800 --> 01:22:59.473
You found me now.

01:23:02.520 --> 01:23:04.989
Morning, Mr. Church.

01:23:07.560 --> 01:23:09.153
Mr. Church?

01:23:15.040 --> 01:23:16.633
Mr. Church?

01:23:18.160 --> 01:23:19.309
Hey.

01:23:19.440 --> 01:23:22.432
Hey, I'm just resting.

01:23:22.520 --> 01:23:24.193
Just resting.

01:23:39.400 --> 01:23:42.677
Mama, where's Mr. Church?

01:23:42.760 --> 01:23:45.479
He's sleeping.

01:23:45.560 --> 01:23:47.119
Sleeping?

01:23:47.200 --> 01:23:49.316
He never sleeps.

01:23:49.400 --> 01:23:51.676
Of course he does, baby.
Everybody sleeps.

01:23:56.240 --> 01:23:57.958
I'll make breakfast.

01:23:58.040 --> 01:24:00.873
- You?
- Yes, me.

01:24:03.360 --> 01:24:06.591
<i>I told work I wouldn't be
coming in anytime soon.</i>

01:24:06.680 --> 01:24:08.193
<i>Mr. Church was on complete bed rest...</i>

01:24:08.280 --> 01:24:11.033
<i>and i2' was my turn
to take care of him.</i>

01:24:13.520 --> 01:24:15.318
<i>Somehow, my hands
were doing the work.</i>

01:24:17.000 --> 01:24:18.991
<i>All those years
watching Mr. Church...</i>

01:24:19.080 --> 01:24:22.152
<i>seemed to have soaked
into my skin, my bones.</i>

01:24:22.240 --> 01:24:24.834
<i>And I knew exactly
what needed to be done.</i>

01:24:24.920 --> 01:24:27.196
<i>I chopped, diced, and minced.</i>

01:24:27.280 --> 01:24:29.317
<i>Mixed, mashed, and beat.</i>

01:24:29.400 --> 01:24:31.676
<i>Stirred, sprinkled,
dashed, and pinched.</i>

01:24:31.760 --> 01:24:33.114
Ready to try?

01:24:34.160 --> 01:24:35.639
It's very hot.

01:24:35.720 --> 01:24:37.233
Be careful.

01:24:46.400 --> 01:24:50.030
<i>And while bread baked,
I sewed.</i>

01:24:50.120 --> 01:24:52.873
<i>And while pies cooled,
I sat at the piano.</i>

01:24:52.960 --> 01:24:55.873
<i>And I realized every talent
Mr. Church had...</i>

01:24:55.960 --> 01:24:57.997
<i>he taught himself
while passing the time...</i>

01:24:58.080 --> 01:24:59.593
<i>caring for someone else.</i>

01:25:03.280 --> 01:25:05.271
- Hey.
- Can I climb up?

01:25:05.360 --> 01:25:07.351
Yes, of course.
Always.

01:25:07.440 --> 01:25:09.670
How's my favorite little girl doing?

01:25:09.760 --> 01:25:12.070
Good.

01:25:12.160 --> 01:25:13.833
Tell me a story.

01:25:13.960 --> 01:25:16.076
Tell you a story.

01:25:16.160 --> 01:25:17.912
Okay.

01:25:18.000 --> 01:25:19.752
Once upon a time...

01:25:19.840 --> 01:25:22.070
They always start that way.

01:25:22.160 --> 01:25:25.278
Well, that's how you know
it's a story, my dear.

01:25:25.360 --> 01:25:30.355
Once upon a time,
there was a little...boy.

01:25:30.440 --> 01:25:32.033
What was his name?

01:25:32.120 --> 01:25:35.636
What would you like
his name to be?

01:25:36.680 --> 01:25:37.875
Henry.

01:25:37.960 --> 01:25:39.314
Like you.

01:25:39.400 --> 01:25:41.789
Well, then Henry it shall be.

01:25:41.880 --> 01:25:45.794
Once upon a time, there was
a little boy named Henry.

01:25:45.880 --> 01:25:49.760
And this boy was afraid
of just about everything...

01:25:49.840 --> 01:25:51.990
except for ladybugs.

01:25:52.120 --> 01:25:54.396
- Ladybugs?
- Ladybugs.

01:25:54.480 --> 01:25:56.312
And one day while he was out...

01:25:56.400 --> 01:25:59.995
a ladybug caught his eye
and he decided to chase it.

01:26:00.080 --> 01:26:02.913
And he chased this ladybug
for so long...

01:26:03.000 --> 01:26:05.230
that he actually turned
into a grown man...

01:26:05.320 --> 01:26:06.674
chasing the same ladybug.

01:26:06.760 --> 01:26:11.152
And the ladybug led him
to a little tiny house.

01:26:11.240 --> 01:26:13.800
And in the house,
he found the kindest woman...

01:26:13.880 --> 01:26:16.235
and her beautiful little girl living there.

01:26:16.320 --> 01:26:18.072
And the man told the woman...

01:26:18.160 --> 01:26:19.958
that he apologized for coming
in the house this way...

01:26:20.040 --> 01:26:22.077
but he was following this ladybug...

01:26:22.160 --> 01:26:24.151
and that he looked everywhere
all over the place.

01:26:24.280 --> 01:26:26.191
He couldn't find it no more.

01:26:26.280 --> 01:26:28.476
He promised her that he'd leave.

01:26:28.560 --> 01:26:32.394
But the woman said,
"Don't leave. Stay."

01:26:32.480 --> 01:26:33.879
She said, "Stay here with us."

01:26:34.000 --> 01:26:37.516
She said, "We don't have much,
but everything we got...

01:26:37.600 --> 01:26:39.876
we'll share with you."

01:26:39.960 --> 01:26:42.474
And did he stay?

01:26:42.560 --> 01:26:44.756
He did.
You know why?

01:26:46.880 --> 01:26:51.716
Because for the first time,
he felt safe.

01:26:53.200 --> 01:26:56.318
For the first time,
he wasn't afraid.

01:26:56.440 --> 01:26:58.636
He felt happy-

01:26:58.720 --> 01:27:00.631
And he promised
that if he ever saw...

01:27:00.720 --> 01:27:02.358
that ladybug again...

01:27:02.440 --> 01:27:04.351
that he was going to thank her.

01:27:04.440 --> 01:27:05.953
Did he?

01:27:06.040 --> 01:27:08.714
Not yet.

01:27:08.800 --> 01:27:11.872
He still hasn't stopped looking.

01:27:14.560 --> 01:27:16.471
Maybe she's in the sky.

01:27:20.920 --> 01:27:22.718
Well, you just might be right.

01:27:26.440 --> 01:27:28.351
You just might be right.

01:27:36.080 --> 01:27:38.435
You should be in bed.

01:28:17.280 --> 01:28:19.112
"The blue level
of the Mediterranean...

01:28:19.200 --> 01:28:22.556
"hugged to its calm breast
the victims of all the wars.

01:28:22.640 --> 01:28:25.314
"Calamity is in the tempest
of its history.

01:28:25.400 --> 01:28:27.869
"The breath of the evening breeze
came to cool...

01:28:27.960 --> 01:28:29.553
"with the mulberry tree...

01:28:29.640 --> 01:28:31.916
"which sighed faintly...

01:28:32.000 --> 01:28:34.799
"as if regretting
the passing of this man.

01:28:34.880 --> 01:28:37.713
"This man of dark deeds
but of large heart...

01:28:37.800 --> 01:28:40.314
"who often at noonday
would lie down...

01:28:40.400 --> 01:28:41.720
to sleep under its shade."

01:28:43.640 --> 01:28:45.039
Okay.

01:28:49.880 --> 01:28:51.678
Can I get you something to eat?

01:28:53.520 --> 01:28:54.510
No.

01:28:55.600 --> 01:28:57.830
You want some water?

01:29:00.520 --> 01:29:01.999
No.

01:29:06.440 --> 01:29:09.000
Okay, well, I'll give you
your privacy.

01:29:09.080 --> 01:29:10.354
No.

01:29:14.360 --> 01:29:16.271
I don't want my privacy.

01:30:05.720 --> 01:30:08.917
Mr. Church, I fell asleep
in this armchair.

01:30:12.000 --> 01:30:13.593
Mr. Church?

01:30:41.960 --> 01:30:43.633
Mr. Church?

01:30:47.680 --> 01:30:49.432
Mr. Church...

01:31:15.680 --> 01:31:17.956
<i>People act strange around death.</i>

01:31:22.320 --> 01:31:23.958
<i>There are those
who talk about everything...</i>

01:31:24.080 --> 01:31:26.151
<i>but the person who died.</i>

01:31:28.000 --> 01:31:31.470
<i>Those who talk about
only the person who died.</i>

01:31:34.040 --> 01:31:35.838
<i>Those who try
to cheer you up.</i>

01:31:38.160 --> 01:31:41.073
<i>And those who can't help
but make you cry.</i>

01:31:48.840 --> 01:31:50.990
<i>And then there are those
who say nothing at all.</i>

01:31:54.360 --> 01:31:56.158
<i>Because they don't have to.</i>

01:32:10.360 --> 01:32:13.512
Yeah, of course.
Thank you so--

01:32:13.600 --> 01:32:16.433
Thank you so much.
Excuse me one second.

01:32:16.520 --> 01:32:17.874
Excuse me.

01:32:19.760 --> 01:32:22.115
- Hi, can I help you?
- Sorry, ma'am.

01:32:22.200 --> 01:32:23.759
Is this Mr. Church's wake?

01:32:23.840 --> 01:32:25.638
Yes.

01:32:25.720 --> 01:32:28.155
I was a friend.
Name's Frankie Twiggs.

01:32:28.240 --> 01:32:29.560
Folks call me Jelly.

01:32:30.600 --> 01:32:31.954
Jelly?

01:32:32.040 --> 01:32:33.519
I'm sorry for, you know,
barging in...

01:32:33.600 --> 01:32:36.194
but we hadn't seen Hands
for quite some time...

01:32:36.320 --> 01:32:37.515
and we done missed him,
and I just--...

01:32:37.600 --> 01:32:38.829
"Hands?"

01:32:38.920 --> 01:32:42.550
Yeah, that's what we called him
on account of...

01:32:42.640 --> 01:32:45.234
He played piano at my bar
for over 30 years.

01:32:45.320 --> 01:32:47.391
So, he worked for you.

01:32:47.520 --> 01:32:49.397
Oh, no, no.
Nothing like that.

01:32:49.480 --> 01:32:51.357
It was more for him, you know?

01:32:51.440 --> 01:32:54.000
One night, he just wandered
over to the piano...

01:32:54.080 --> 01:32:56.310
and then, barn,
he started playing.

01:32:56.400 --> 01:32:58.073
Place lit up.

01:32:58.160 --> 01:33:00.037
I'm telling you,
this cat was good.

01:33:00.120 --> 01:33:02.077
I thought somebody famous
had just walked in...

01:33:02.160 --> 01:33:03.355
to get a drink, you know?

01:33:03.440 --> 01:33:06.671
He was a whole lot of magic.

01:33:08.120 --> 01:33:10.873
I'm Charlie.

01:33:10.960 --> 01:33:13.679
Pleasure to make
your acquaintance, Charlie.

01:33:13.760 --> 01:33:16.149
Izzy?

01:33:16.240 --> 01:33:17.833
Come here, baby.

01:33:17.920 --> 01:33:20.594
I want you to meet
a good friend of Mr. Church's.

01:33:20.680 --> 01:33:22.717
Here, this is Mr. Church's recipe.

01:33:22.800 --> 01:33:24.552
What?

01:33:24.640 --> 01:33:26.756
I didn't know he could cook.

01:33:33.000 --> 01:33:34.673
This is Izzy.

01:33:34.760 --> 01:33:37.274
- Can you say hi, baby?
- Hi.

01:33:37.360 --> 01:33:39.874
This is Mr. Jelly.

01:33:39.960 --> 01:33:41.359
Twiggs.

01:33:51.120 --> 01:33:52.713
<i>Mr. Church once said...</i>

01:33:52.800 --> 01:33:55.553
<i>a book is meant to be read
from beginning to end...</i>

01:33:55.640 --> 01:33:58.712
<i>but is best understood
from end to beginning.</i>

01:34:01.000 --> 01:34:03.833
<i>I suppose everything
does happen for a reason.</i>

01:34:04.960 --> 01:34:06.394
<i>Mama dying.</i>

01:34:06.480 --> 01:34:09.074
<i>Larson saving my baby
and himself.</i>

01:34:09.160 --> 01:34:11.993
<i>Poppy finding a dollhouse
of her own.</i>

01:34:12.080 --> 01:34:13.593
<i>Even Owen...</i>

01:34:13.680 --> 01:34:15.671
<i>the most beautiful 10-year-old boy...</i>

01:34:15.760 --> 01:34:19.310
<i>on this or any other planet
becoming a doctor.</i>

01:35:23.640 --> 01:35:25.313
<i>"Dear Charlotte.</i>

01:35:25.400 --> 01:35:27.550
<i>"You've said you just want
to know me.</i>

01:35:27.640 --> 01:35:31.554
<i>"My dear, you always have.</i>

01:35:31.640 --> 01:35:33.836
<i>"I'm simply a man.</i>

01:35:33.920 --> 01:35:36.070
<i>"Not without faults.</i>

01:35:36.160 --> 01:35:38.151
<i>"That can happen
when you're not the son...</i>

01:35:38.240 --> 01:35:40.231
<i>"your father hoped you'd be...</i>

01:35:40.320 --> 01:35:42.914
<i>"despite his verbal abuse
and beatings.</i>

01:35:45.280 --> 01:35:46.554
<i>"I know you think
I took care of you...</i>

01:35:46.640 --> 01:35:47.994
<i>"and your mother and Izzy...</i>

01:35:48.080 --> 01:35:50.310
<i>"and you gave me nothing
in return.</i>

01:35:52.120 --> 01:35:53.838
<i>"You gave me
the most important thing...</i>

01:35:53.920 --> 01:35:54.990
<i>"life can offer.</i>

01:35:57.760 --> 01:35:59.797
<i>"You gave me a family.</i>

01:36:00.920 --> 01:36:02.991
<i>"And love.</i>

01:36:05.000 --> 01:36:06.593
<i>Henry."</i>

01:36:27.880 --> 01:36:29.518
Mr. Church?

01:36:36.840 --> 01:36:38.353
Henry?

01:36:47.760 --> 01:36:49.398
I'm making eggs and grits, Mama.

01:36:49.480 --> 01:36:51.551
Like Mr. Church showed us.

01:36:51.640 --> 01:36:55.031
Oh, this looks so yummy.

01:36:55.160 --> 01:36:56.594
Thank you.
Thank you.

01:36:56.680 --> 01:36:58.318
Can you set the table for us?

01:36:58.400 --> 01:37:00.630
I can get plates.

01:37:03.680 --> 01:37:07.071
Okay, this will be for me.
This will be for you.

01:37:07.160 --> 01:37:08.798
What do you need?
You're adding a little salt.

01:37:08.880 --> 01:37:10.279
What about cheese?
You need cheese?

01:37:10.360 --> 01:37:11.759
- Yeah.
- Yeah? Here you go.

01:37:14.000 --> 01:37:15.035
More cheese?

01:37:40.600 --> 01:37:42.273
<i>I was wrong when I said...</i>

01:37:42.360 --> 01:37:43.919
<i>the legacy of the Brooks family...</i>

01:37:44.000 --> 01:37:45.673
<i>is having babies out of wedlock.</i>

01:37:46.160 --> 01:37:49.949
<i>The legacy of this family
is Mr. Church.</i>

01:38:12.960 --> 01:38:14.951
<i>Henry Joseph Church
could have been anything...</i>

01:38:15.040 --> 01:38:16.474
<i>he wanted to be.</i>

01:38:17.040 --> 01:38:18.792
<i>He chose to cook.</i>

01:38:19.840 --> 01:38:22.480
<i>The key, he said, jazz.</i>
