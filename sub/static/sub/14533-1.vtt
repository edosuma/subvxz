00:31.625 --> 00:33.166
For the final time...

00:33.166 --> 00:37.583
Old Glory rises
by these hands.

00:42.291 --> 00:44.500
Suffice to say,
it has been an honor.

00:44.500 --> 00:46.250
Yeah.

00:46.250 --> 00:48.041
Gamby:
It's gonna be okay, sir.

00:48.041 --> 00:50.959
I-- I just know that
Maria's gonna pull through.

00:50.959 --> 00:53.917
I'm just so sorry
to leave both of you
in this situation--

00:53.917 --> 00:58.166
principal-less just as
the school year is
picking up steam.

00:58.166 --> 01:00.625
But Maria needs me now.

01:00.625 --> 01:01.792
Russell:
Uh, Principal Welles?

01:01.792 --> 01:03.917
I-- I don't want to make
light of the situation,

01:03.917 --> 01:05.208
but for my own
knowledge, sir,

01:05.208 --> 01:06.959
and if you don't feel
comfortable saying,

01:06.959 --> 01:08.458
please feel free to decline,

01:08.458 --> 01:10.458
but do you know
who will be replacing you?

01:10.458 --> 01:12.458
Oh, here come the buzzards.
Why don't you just let

01:12.458 --> 01:14.291
the man grieve
for his dying wife, huh?

01:14.291 --> 01:15.750
Give him that.

01:15.750 --> 01:17.458
Superintendent Haas

01:17.458 --> 01:19.291
has yet to make a decision.

01:19.291 --> 01:20.333
Quite frankly,

01:20.333 --> 01:22.458
I could give a damn
whoever it is.

01:22.458 --> 01:24.500
Just remember one thing,

01:24.500 --> 01:26.667
it's all about the students.

01:26.667 --> 01:29.250
It's not about you two.

01:29.250 --> 01:30.417
That's very wise.

01:30.417 --> 01:31.834
I get it. I mean,
it might take

01:31.834 --> 01:33.792
a little while for it to
sink in with this one here,

01:33.792 --> 01:34.959
but I hear you
loud and clear.

01:34.959 --> 01:36.750
It's a Gamby promise.
Go to hell, Gamby.

01:36.750 --> 01:37.959
Make me go to hell, Lee.

01:37.959 --> 01:39.000
Enough.
Enough.

01:39.000 --> 01:40.625
You enough.
Oh, fuck off.

01:40.625 --> 01:42.291
No, I will not.
Fuck off!

01:42.291 --> 01:44.875
You fuck yourself off.
If you like it so much, you--
You fuck, Fuck you.

01:44.875 --> 01:46.458
Just say the goddamn pledge!

01:49.708 --> 01:50.834
Fuck-head.

01:50.834 --> 01:51.875
Shit fucker.

01:51.875 --> 01:53.792
All:
I pledge allegiance

01:53.792 --> 01:55.250
to the Flag

01:55.250 --> 01:57.834
of the United States
of America

01:57.834 --> 02:00.542
and to the Republic
for which it stands,

02:00.542 --> 02:05.583
one Nation under God,
indivisible, with liberty

02:05.583 --> 02:07.333

Aah!

02:07.333 --> 02:10.000
I'm going to turn around
now, knuckleheads.

02:13.083 --> 02:14.625
That was a good pledge, sir.

02:14.625 --> 02:16.125
It was a very good
pledge, sir.

03:05.208 --> 03:07.750
Principal Welles'
last day at school,

03:07.750 --> 03:10.583
and this is the day
you all decide to throw down.

03:10.583 --> 03:12.291
It's not very respectful,
if you ask me.

03:12.291 --> 03:14.542
Makes me sick just looking
at all three of you.

03:14.542 --> 03:16.291
Sick to my stomach.

03:16.291 --> 03:18.000
You see that paddle
over there?

03:18.000 --> 03:20.917
That paddle used to
belong to my father
when he was a principal.

03:20.917 --> 03:22.333
You wanna throw punches
in the hallway?

03:22.333 --> 03:25.083
I will pull that paddle down
and it will swing.

03:25.083 --> 03:27.041
We were just kidding around.
Josh, shut it.

03:27.041 --> 03:29.291
Matthew, what happened?

03:29.291 --> 03:30.625
Ms. Snodgrass:
Oh, I can help.

03:30.625 --> 03:32.000
He was being bullied.

03:32.000 --> 03:33.250
He didn't throw
a single punch.

03:33.250 --> 03:36.000
Ms. Snodgrass,
I know that it's probably

03:36.000 --> 03:38.083
a very dramatic thing
for a beautiful woman

03:38.083 --> 03:40.375
like yourself to witness
such barbarianism,

03:40.375 --> 03:42.667
but please allow me to conduct
the investigation, okay?

03:42.667 --> 03:44.000
Matthew, go head.

03:44.959 --> 03:46.291
Josh is right.

03:46.291 --> 03:47.792
We were just playing around

03:47.792 --> 03:49.291
and got carried away.

03:50.625 --> 03:52.667
All right, stonewall me, man.

03:52.667 --> 03:54.333
I can't help you
if you don't let me.

03:54.333 --> 03:55.917
Neal! Ga-- Ga-- Mr. Gamby,

03:55.917 --> 03:57.959
excuse me,
but obviously these two

03:57.959 --> 04:00.000
are pressuring Matthew
into not saying anything.

04:00.000 --> 04:02.792
And take it from me,
he's a good student.
Yeah, I understand.

04:02.792 --> 04:04.917
Uh, I deal with them
on a regular basis, all right?

04:04.917 --> 04:06.291
Now, I get it.
You're a new teacher.

04:06.291 --> 04:08.417
You're full of ideals.
Bright-eyed and bushy-tailed.

04:08.417 --> 04:10.708
But you're a little out
of your jurisdiction, okay?

04:10.708 --> 04:12.500
We got a zero-tolerance policy

04:12.500 --> 04:14.083
when it comes to violence
in this school.

04:14.083 --> 04:15.542
Doesn't matter who started it.

04:15.542 --> 04:16.667

You punch like a woman.

04:27.834 --> 04:29.083
Potter, Josh Props,

04:29.083 --> 04:30.834
Five days
in-school suspension.

04:30.834 --> 04:32.583
Potter, I don't want to see
you in here again.

04:32.583 --> 04:33.750

04:33.750 --> 04:35.291
Josh Props, I know
I'll see you again,

04:42.375 --> 04:44.125
Guess we took care
of that, huh?

04:44.125 --> 04:46.667
I can't believe you're gonna
put something like that
on Matthew's record.

04:46.667 --> 04:48.917
Rules are rules.
Yeah, but if a rule is unfair,

04:48.917 --> 04:50.583
then maybe
it shouldn't be enforced.

04:50.583 --> 04:52.125
Well, you know,
that might be the way

That's pretty fucking
pathetic, don't you think?

08:48.750 --> 08:51.250
And I saw your little
fucking sign.
What sign?

08:51.250 --> 08:52.917
Don't motherfucking
play games with me.

08:52.917 --> 08:55.000
Listen here, you.
Come tomorrow,

08:55.000 --> 08:56.417
there's a brand new
principal in town,

08:56.417 --> 08:58.333
and his name
is Neal Gamby.

08:58.333 --> 09:00.041
And those who want
to be catty little bitches,

09:00.041 --> 09:02.125
well, they can kiss
their fucking jobs goodbye.

09:02.125 --> 09:03.458
That is a Gamby promise.

09:03.458 --> 09:05.208
You're so confident,
aren't you, Gamby?

09:05.208 --> 09:08.333
Too bad the school board's
still undecided.

09:08.333 --> 09:09.458
(scoffs)
No, they're not.

09:09.458 --> 09:11.083
They know exactly who
is gonna be the principal.

09:11.083 --> 09:14.125
Why is this job
so important to you, Gamby?

09:14.125 --> 09:17.625
Is it 'cause you got
absolutely dick-all else
going on in your life?

09:17.625 --> 09:18.959
You wish you had my life.

09:18.959 --> 09:20.875
A fucking divorced loser
is what you are.

09:20.875 --> 09:22.542
Look at you,
just rock hard

09:22.542 --> 09:23.750
at the thought
of all that power.

09:23.750 --> 09:26.125
I know you like to think
about my dick, but don't.

09:26.125 --> 09:28.375
It's private property.
Eat shit, Gamby!

09:28.375 --> 09:31.166
No thank you, but have fun
imagining it though.

09:31.166 --> 09:33.041
(glass clatters)
Cats.

09:33.041 --> 09:34.667
Fucker.

09:38.625 --> 09:41.166
Make one more fucking sign
and see what happens.

09:41.166 --> 09:42.625
(door opens)

09:46.291 --> 09:47.458
Go Janelle!

09:47.458 --> 09:49.500
Gale: Whoo! Yes!
Ray: There you go.

09:49.500 --> 09:51.291
Nice work, baby.
There you go. Right there.

09:51.291 --> 09:52.708
Nice work.
Right there.

09:52.708 --> 09:55.000
Right there.
I know. She's gotta keep
the heels down though.

09:57.750 --> 09:59.375
Hello, Gale, Ray.

09:59.375 --> 10:00.542
You're late.

10:00.542 --> 10:02.875
Janelle just had
a really good run.
You missed it.

10:02.875 --> 10:05.166
Actually, I saw it
when I was walking up.
Worry about yourself.

10:05.166 --> 10:06.125
Hey, Janelle!

10:06.125 --> 10:08.041
Good job, baby! Good job!
Whoo!

10:08.041 --> 10:09.333
Keep your heels down, babes.

10:09.333 --> 10:11.000
Keep your heels
however you want, Janelle.

10:11.000 --> 10:12.542
Focus on yourself,
not on negative people

10:12.542 --> 10:15.417

tell you how to do things.

10:16.500 --> 10:17.542

10:17.542 --> 10:19.041

10:19.041 --> 10:20.291
(sarcastically)
Cool.

10:20.291 --> 10:22.083
(in same tone)
Cool.

10:22.083 --> 10:23.333
You can go ahead
and admit it.

10:23.333 --> 10:24.667
My success enrages you.

10:24.667 --> 10:26.291
I actually don't care at all.

10:26.291 --> 10:27.875
Oh, you don't care?
Sure, you don't care.

10:27.875 --> 10:29.667
Course you care.
No, you're right, Neal.

10:29.667 --> 10:30.834
I'm always thinking about you.

10:30.834 --> 10:33.083
You're right.
I forgot it's all about you.

10:33.083 --> 10:34.375
Well, actually,
it's not about me

10:34.375 --> 10:36.708
because my mentor's wife
was diagnosed with melanoma.

10:36.708 --> 10:38.208
So, how silly
do you sound now?

10:38.208 --> 10:39.875
Oh, sorry to hear
about that, Gamby.

10:39.875 --> 10:41.750
That's awesome
about the principal job.

10:41.750 --> 10:43.417
You've been working
really hard, man.

10:43.417 --> 10:44.917
I knew good things were
gonna happen to you.

10:44.917 --> 10:46.625
Congrats, buddy.
Ray, nobody asked you
to chime in.

10:46.625 --> 10:49.333
And it's not even
official yet, so don't go,
like, running your mouth

10:49.333 --> 10:50.542

like you always do,

10:50.542 --> 10:52.208
being a little gossip,
a little hen.

10:52.208 --> 10:53.417
I'm just impressed.

10:53.417 --> 10:55.208
Must be tough wrangling
all them kids.

10:55.208 --> 10:56.375
I don't know how
you do it, man.

10:56.375 --> 10:58.166
Of course you don't
understand how I do it.

10:58.166 --> 10:59.959
I bet if I told you
I just stole a man's wife

10:59.959 --> 11:01.834
and family,
you'd understand
how to do that, huh?

11:01.834 --> 11:03.875
Why don't you go sit
somewhere else, Neal?

11:03.875 --> 11:05.041
Nope.

11:09.959 --> 11:11.917

11:13.542 --> 11:15.000
Yeah? What high school
do you go to?

11:15.000 --> 11:16.750

11:23.250 --> 11:24.834
I took it off.
It was all sweaty.

11:24.834 --> 11:26.250
Put it on.

11:26.250 --> 11:28.208
But Dad, it's nasty.
Put it on.

11:28.208 --> 11:29.583
Okay, okay.
Put it on.

11:29.583 --> 11:31.041
Got it!
Get it on. Put it on.

11:31.041 --> 11:33.083
Put it on. Get it on.
Get it-- get it on.
Dad, I got it!

11:33.083 --> 11:34.083
Move! Get out of here!

11:34.083 --> 11:35.291
Get it on. Push it on.
Stop!

11:35.291 --> 11:37.083
Get it on.
Don't! Gosh, Dad! I got it!

11:37.083 --> 11:39.417
Look. I'm not trying to yell.
I just, I know, you've been

11:39.417 --> 11:40.750
spending a lot of time
with your mom,

11:40.750 --> 11:42.291
and that's the kind
of example she sets.

11:42.291 --> 11:45.333
But you-- you can't go around
being fast with the boys.

11:45.333 --> 11:46.542
That's not how a lady acts.

11:46.542 --> 11:47.792
All right, Dad.

11:48.917 --> 11:50.041
Got some good news.

11:50.041 --> 11:51.250
You're looking at

11:51.250 --> 11:54.125
the brand new principal
of North Jackson High.

11:54.125 --> 11:56.583
No way. So, that means
when I get to high school,

11:56.583 --> 11:58.583
I can do whatever I want
and never get in trouble?

11:58.583 --> 12:00.625
Oh, well, that's what
you'd think, but no.

12:00.625 --> 12:02.291

I'll have to go

gonna be your daughter.

12:11.625 --> 12:12.917
Okay, well,
wrap it up, Neal.

12:12.917 --> 12:14.834
Not married anymore,
so you can't tell me
what to do.

12:14.834 --> 12:16.959

12:16.959 --> 12:18.458

17:16.875 --> 17:18.917
and I'm pretty affirmative
about how she got in.
Woman 1: Whoa!

17:18.917 --> 17:20.917
Woman 2: That's kind of harsh.
Here's what I'm proposing.

17:20.917 --> 17:22.875
I'm gonna file
a formal complaint
with the school board.

17:22.875 --> 17:24.625
A complaint?
What's it gonna say?

17:24.625 --> 17:26.583
Gonna say they fucked up.
They chose the wrong person.

17:26.583 --> 17:28.125
Maybe they need to
reconsider things.

17:28.125 --> 17:29.166
Maybe make me principal.

17:29.166 --> 17:30.166
But what I'm gonna need

17:30.166 --> 17:31.625
for this to work
is all of you guys

17:31.625 --> 17:33.166
to sign this complaint with me

17:33.166 --> 17:35.000
so they know
we mean business.
(teachers snickering)

17:35.000 --> 17:36.959
No, I'm not putting
my name on that.

17:36.959 --> 17:38.458
Not a chance.
Not a chance.

17:38.458 --> 17:40.083
"Not a chance.
Not a chance."

17:40.083 --> 17:41.458
Y'all never
backed me up before.

17:41.458 --> 17:43.583
I don't know why
I thought this time
would be any different.

17:43.583 --> 17:44.959
Why don't you
shut the fuck up?

17:44.959 --> 17:49.000
Nobody here wants to listen
to your misguided bullshit.

17:49.000 --> 17:50.291
If it isn't the snake
in the shadows.

17:50.291 --> 17:51.375
Russell, buzz the fuck off.

17:51.375 --> 17:52.625
This has nothing
to do with you.

17:52.625 --> 17:55.625
Gamby, I think I speak
for everyone here

17:55.625 --> 17:57.250
when I say
you're a jerk-off

17:57.250 --> 17:59.500
and no one wants to sign
your stupid letter.

17:59.500 --> 18:01.041
Stupid letter?
Yeah.

18:01.041 --> 18:03.083
You know, I'm getting
pretty sick and tired

18:03.083 --> 18:05.166
of that know-it-all mouth
of yours, Russell.

18:05.166 --> 18:06.417
Oh, well then...
(stomps)

18:06.417 --> 18:07.834
make your move, motherfucker.

18:10.667 --> 18:12.250
Make your move, motherfucker,

18:12.250 --> 18:14.667
but you better have
a gun, Mister.
I don't need a gun.

18:14.667 --> 18:16.041
Oh, you don't need a gun?

18:16.041 --> 18:18.166
But if I did need a gun,
I could get a better gun
than you.

18:18.166 --> 18:20.333
Teacher:
Guys! Come on!

18:20.333 --> 18:21.583
Russell:
Bruce!

18:21.583 --> 18:23.834
Bruce!
All right, all right!
Hey, hey! I said knock it off!

18:23.834 --> 18:25.166
Settle down!
Bruce! Bruce!

18:25.166 --> 18:26.291
All right, all right,
all right!

18:26.291 --> 18:27.500
Teacher:
Everybody settle down!

18:27.500 --> 18:29.166
Settle down!
No need to get violent.

18:29.166 --> 18:30.667
No violence.
Gamby: Y'all heard it.

18:30.667 --> 18:32.291
He talked about bringing
a gun to school.

18:33.500 --> 18:35.583
Oh, you look
so stupid right now.

18:35.583 --> 18:36.667
I don't need
any of y'all!

18:36.667 --> 18:38.208
I'll take care
of this shit myself.

18:38.208 --> 18:39.834
(door opens)
(alarm chimes)

18:47.041 --> 18:49.208
Both: Surprise!
Ah, shit!

18:50.041 --> 18:52.041
Neal!
Goddamn it, Ray!

18:52.041 --> 18:53.250
You broke my computer!

18:53.250 --> 18:54.667
You don't like
the surprise?

18:54.667 --> 18:55.834
I don't even know
what this is.

18:55.834 --> 18:57.000
What are you doing here?

18:57.000 --> 18:59.208
Janelle wanted to celebrate
your big promotion, man.

18:59.208 --> 19:00.542
Why are you a part of this?

19:00.542 --> 19:03.458
Bug here needed a ride
and Gale, she...

19:03.458 --> 19:04.625
she didn't want
any part of it.

19:04.625 --> 19:06.542
I should've known
you were behind this.

19:06.542 --> 19:08.208
I hate that you're about to
see me like this,

19:08.208 --> 19:10.708
but I don't have the strength
to fight you anymore, Ray.

19:10.708 --> 19:11.834
(sniffles)
Damn it.

19:11.834 --> 19:13.166
Is this what you wanted?

19:16.000 --> 19:17.542
I didn't get the job.

19:17.542 --> 19:19.417
They gave it to somebody else.

19:19.417 --> 19:21.250
Oh, Neal, I hate that
for you, man.

19:21.250 --> 19:22.708
Why didn't they choose you?

19:22.708 --> 19:24.250
Well, baby, when
you're the person

19:24.250 --> 19:26.834
enforcing the laws,
you don't get to make
a lot of friends.

19:26.834 --> 19:29.125
Not a lot of people like me.

19:29.125 --> 19:30.333
People like you.

19:30.333 --> 19:32.917
No, I know it's hard
to believe, but they don't.

19:32.917 --> 19:34.917
I just expect a lot
out of people,

19:34.917 --> 19:36.500
and for whatever reason,
it pushes them away.

19:36.500 --> 19:38.417
God knows it did your mom.

19:38.417 --> 19:40.291
Hey, Gale's...

19:40.291 --> 19:42.041
She got a shit-ton
of respect for you, Neal.

19:42.041 --> 19:44.708
I'm not trying to get back
my ex-wife, Ray.

19:44.708 --> 19:46.083
And please stop
calling me Neal.

19:46.083 --> 19:47.208
Well...

19:47.208 --> 19:49.333
can't you get them
to change their mind?

19:49.333 --> 19:50.625
I tried.

19:50.625 --> 19:53.291
I tried to rally the teachers
and get them to support me,

19:53.291 --> 19:55.417
but like I said,
nobody likes me.

19:55.417 --> 19:57.250
Who cares about the teachers?

19:57.250 --> 19:58.542
The students like you.

19:58.542 --> 20:00.166
Don't they?

20:00.166 --> 20:01.458
The students.

20:02.583 --> 20:03.583
Ray: See?

20:03.583 --> 20:05.208
They like you, right?

20:05.208 --> 20:06.583
No, they don't.

20:06.583 --> 20:08.750
You're completely wrong.

20:08.750 --> 20:09.792
But it doesn't matter.

20:09.792 --> 20:11.667
Because they fear me.

20:11.667 --> 20:13.417
And that's even better.

20:14.625 --> 20:15.625
My bad.

20:15.625 --> 20:17.625
It is your bad.

20:17.625 --> 20:19.291
(indistinct conversation)

20:21.166 --> 20:22.458
(brakes screech)

20:23.917 --> 20:25.208
Matthew Potter!

20:25.208 --> 20:26.959
What's shakin'?

20:26.959 --> 20:29.250
Just waitin'
on the bus.

20:29.250 --> 20:31.500
I'm your bus today.

20:31.500 --> 20:32.625
Get in.

20:35.125 --> 20:37.291
So how's I.S.S.
been treatin' you?

20:38.667 --> 20:40.125
So far so good.

20:40.125 --> 20:42.291
So far so good?
(chuckles)

20:42.291 --> 20:43.834
You know what happens
to smart kids

20:43.834 --> 20:45.458
like you in I.S.S.?

20:45.458 --> 20:46.917
You get turned
the fuck out.

20:46.917 --> 20:48.667
You know what
"turned out" means?

20:48.667 --> 20:49.792
No-- no, sir.

20:49.792 --> 20:51.583
It's when a straight dude
rolls in to prison

20:51.583 --> 20:54.333
and gets his ass fucked,
then becomes a girl.

20:55.500 --> 20:57.667
Well, that hasn't
happened yet.

20:57.667 --> 21:00.000
Yet? You've still got
a few more days in there.

21:00.000 --> 21:01.625
Plenty of time
for that shit to go down.

21:01.625 --> 21:03.000
Big boys will come in,

21:03.000 --> 21:04.500
push a little boy
like you down,

21:04.500 --> 21:07.000
maybe stick a textbook
in your mouth and go
to fucking town.

21:07.000 --> 21:08.542
You want that
to happen to you?

21:08.542 --> 21:10.625
No.
Yeah, I didn't think so.

21:10.625 --> 21:13.333
What would you say, Matthew,
if I could get you out
of I.S.S. today?

21:13.333 --> 21:15.333
Get the whole goddamn thing
wiped from your record?

21:15.333 --> 21:18.250
You're a good kid.
You don't want something
like that following you around

21:18.250 --> 21:20.000
when it comes time
to apply for college.

21:20.000 --> 21:21.500
I can set you free.
Would you like that?

21:21.500 --> 21:23.625
Well, yeah, but why?

21:23.625 --> 21:25.917
I want you to organize
a mass-student walkout.

21:25.917 --> 21:27.834
Arrange all
your goddamn classmates

21:27.834 --> 21:29.542
to get out of the school
at the same exact time

21:29.542 --> 21:31.667
and protest at how much
you hate the new principal.

21:31.667 --> 21:34.208
Walkout? Like, leave school?
Yeah.

21:34.208 --> 21:36.166
All-school walkout today.

21:36.166 --> 21:39.000
Every motherfucking student
in school at 2:03 PM.

21:39.000 --> 21:40.208
Are we clear?

21:40.208 --> 21:41.417
Yeah.
Boom.

21:41.417 --> 21:43.208
That's what I want to hear.

21:43.208 --> 21:46.041
(school bell chimes)

21:49.417 --> 21:50.458
(whistles)

21:50.458 --> 21:52.375
Oh! Uh--
Hey.

21:52.375 --> 21:53.250
Mr. Gamby, hey.

21:53.250 --> 21:55.500
You, uh, feeding your fishes?
Sure am.

21:55.500 --> 21:57.000
What kind are they? Gold?

21:57.000 --> 21:58.542
Yep.

21:58.542 --> 22:00.834
I just wanted to, uh,
drop by and give you
a little bit of an update.

22:00.834 --> 22:03.750
Matthew Potter's a good kid,
and, uh, you were right,

22:03.750 --> 22:05.708
he doesn't deserve to have
the book thrown at him.

22:05.708 --> 22:09.500
So, I've immediately
released him from I.S.S.
Wow.

22:09.500 --> 22:11.333
That's a big
turnaround for you.

22:11.333 --> 22:14.041
What happened to the
"rules are rules" thing?

22:14.041 --> 22:16.083
Well, I never really
said it like that, but--

22:16.083 --> 22:17.291
You did.
Rule--

22:17.291 --> 22:19.375
No, I didn't,
but rules are rules.

22:19.375 --> 22:21.125
I still believe that,

22:21.125 --> 22:23.125
but also fairness is fairness.

22:23.125 --> 22:24.708
You understand
what I'm saying here.

22:24.708 --> 22:26.750
Look, I-- I know
things have been crazy,

22:26.750 --> 22:28.250
you know, with all
the recent changes.

22:28.250 --> 22:30.000
I'm sure that's why
you were popping off to me.

22:30.000 --> 22:33.333
But, uh, I just wanted
to let you know that

22:33.333 --> 22:35.500
you shouldn't give up
hope just yet.

22:35.500 --> 22:38.166
There's still some adults left
here at North Jackson High.

22:38.166 --> 22:41.458
Oh, that's-- that's--
that's good to hear.

22:41.458 --> 22:42.583
Yeah.

22:42.583 --> 22:44.458
You're strong.
I like that.

22:44.458 --> 22:46.708
The tides are turning,
Ms. Snodgrass.

22:46.708 --> 22:49.250
Good guys,
they're about to win.

22:53.125 --> 22:54.834
Gamby:
Look at Lee Russell.

22:54.834 --> 22:56.291
That little sassy cuss.

22:56.291 --> 22:57.458
Fuck you.

22:57.458 --> 22:58.417
Bitch.

22:58.417 --> 23:00.875
Don't matter.
Let them have their fun.

23:00.875 --> 23:03.125
Sounds like you up
to something to me, Mr. Gamby.

23:03.125 --> 23:05.375
Let's just say all will
be revealed in due time.

23:05.375 --> 23:08.000
The revolution
will not be televised.

23:08.000 --> 23:11.959
Oh, no. It's just gonna happen
regular in front of everybody

23:11.959 --> 23:15.959
at approximately
2:03 PM today.

23:15.959 --> 23:18.041
What you mean?
Like a school shooting
or something?

23:18.041 --> 23:19.667
No, Dayshawn,
not like a school shooting.

23:19.667 --> 23:20.792
Don't be scaring
these children.

23:20.792 --> 23:22.125
I'm talking
about a non-violent,

23:22.125 --> 23:23.333
hearts and mind campaign.

23:24.834 --> 23:26.166
Okay. That sounds dope.

23:26.166 --> 23:29.417
Oh, yeah, it's definitely
gonna be dope.

23:29.417 --> 23:30.625
Super dope.

23:30.625 --> 23:32.875
You're not gonna
kill everybody, right?

23:32.875 --> 23:35.333
No, Dayshawn.
I told you, I'm not
gonna murder anybody.

23:35.333 --> 23:37.291
Oh, we're so happy
to have you here!

23:37.291 --> 23:39.125
Oh, thank you! Ooh!

23:39.125 --> 23:41.166
Not yet.

23:41.166 --> 23:43.000
So I'm gonna need
your help planning

23:43.000 --> 23:44.792
my first faculty meeting.

23:44.792 --> 23:45.959
I want the opportunity

23:45.959 --> 23:47.875
to show myself,
but also have some fun.

23:47.875 --> 23:50.500
Russell:
Oh. Um...

23:50.500 --> 23:51.458
Ah!

23:51.458 --> 23:53.875
Light bulb! Ice cream social!

23:53.875 --> 23:56.125
Let them know
how sweet you are!

23:56.125 --> 23:57.959
Oh, Russell,
you don't quit, do you?

I'm lactose intolerant.

Makes me do diarrhea

complicated, but I'm gonna

I tried, I tried.

25:29.250 --> 25:31.583
Couldn't talk
any of your friends
into leaving school?

25:31.583 --> 25:34.125
Kids fucking hate school!
Nobody would do it!

25:34.125 --> 25:35.250
I tried,
I promise.

right in your asshole!

25:43.458 --> 25:44.667
Damn it!

25:46.708 --> 25:48.333
Look. Speak of the devil.

25:50.125 --> 25:51.291
Gamby:
Are we done here?

25:51.291 --> 25:54.083
Well, actually, I'd love to
speak with you a moment.

25:54.083 --> 25:56.083
Have a seat.
Uh, closed, right?

25:56.083 --> 25:57.625
Yes, Lee. Thank you.

25:59.041 --> 26:00.083
(sighs)

26:00.083 --> 26:02.792
Mr. Gamby, it appears
that someone has filed

26:02.792 --> 26:05.166
a complaint against me
with the school board.

26:05.166 --> 26:07.250
Hm. That's interesting.

26:08.583 --> 26:10.083
Is there anything
you'd like to

26:10.083 --> 26:12.041
get off your chest,
Mr. Gamby?

26:12.041 --> 26:14.458
I mean, nothing really
comes to the mind.

26:14.458 --> 26:16.208
Well, this complaint says,
and I quote,

26:16.208 --> 26:19.875
"She's not very smart,
and if she's in charge,

26:19.875 --> 26:22.625
"this school will suffer
in a horrible way.

26:22.625 --> 26:26.166
"Dr. Brown only cares
about herself.

26:26.166 --> 26:29.333
"She really thinks
she's something."

26:29.333 --> 26:30.500
(blows)

26:30.500 --> 26:32.000
Now, who would write
such a thing?

26:32.000 --> 26:33.583
I don't know.
I'm not sure.

26:33.583 --> 26:34.792
Does it say who wrote it?

26:35.959 --> 26:37.625
Why, yes, it does.

26:38.834 --> 26:39.834
Okay, fine.
I'll admit it.

26:39.834 --> 26:42.291
I wrote the complaint
against you.

26:42.291 --> 26:45.458
Mr. Gamby, I've been doing
his for some time now.

26:45.458 --> 26:47.125
Whenever a new
principal shows up

26:47.125 --> 26:48.875
at a school,
you can guarantee

26:48.875 --> 26:51.166
that people feel like
they've been passed over,

26:51.166 --> 26:54.417
and often times,
they resent the new principal.

26:54.417 --> 26:56.875
I can live
with people resenting me.

26:56.875 --> 26:58.250
That's fine.

26:58.250 --> 26:59.583
But from now on,

26:59.583 --> 27:01.834
you're going to be
very cooperative

27:01.834 --> 27:04.792
and very pleasant
when dealing with me

27:04.792 --> 27:07.458
because if you're not
cooperative, Mr. Gamby,

27:07.458 --> 27:09.041
and if you're not pleasant,

27:09.041 --> 27:14.166
I will drag your face all up
and down the parking lot
of this motherfucker.

27:14.166 --> 27:16.834
Now, do we understand
each other, Mr. Gamby?

27:18.375 --> 27:19.834
Yes, Dr. Brown.

27:20.834 --> 27:22.250
Wonderful!

27:22.250 --> 27:26.250
Now, I would like for you to
come in two hours earlier
every morning.

27:26.250 --> 27:27.500
I want you to jump in

27:27.500 --> 27:29.708
on the morning
Driver's Ed program.

27:29.708 --> 27:31.708
That means I gotta
be here at 5:10 AM.

27:31.708 --> 27:34.208
Is that a problem,
Mr. Gamby?

27:35.417 --> 27:37.041
No, it's not a problem.

27:37.041 --> 27:39.208
Well, if that's all,
you're dismissed.

27:39.208 --> 27:41.166
Have a blessed day.

27:41.166 --> 27:43.917
You have a...
blessed day too.

27:43.917 --> 27:45.792
Oh!

27:45.792 --> 27:47.250
Thank you.

27:48.708 --> 27:50.750
Leave it open.
Say who?

27:50.750 --> 27:51.667
Open.

27:51.667 --> 27:53.458

Leave it.
