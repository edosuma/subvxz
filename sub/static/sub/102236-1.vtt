WEBVTT

06:22.308 --> 06:23.342
Yeah, I...

06:23.375 --> 06:26.378
I can ask my mom when
she gets back on Thursday.

06:26.412 --> 06:29.215
I wouldn't ask my dad,
'cause he'll just say "no"

06:29.248 --> 06:32.017
and give some stupid
arbitrary reason why.

06:34.753 --> 06:35.888
You're sure it's okay, though?

06:35.921 --> 06:37.857
Yeah, of course.

06:37.890 --> 06:40.159
What are you gonna
do tonight, though?

07:15.928 --> 07:17.662
Sarah?

09:16.315 --> 09:18.550
Fuck yourselves!

09:18.584 --> 09:25.858
Freak.
Such a weirdo.

09:32.598 --> 09:34.133
Hey.

09:34.166 --> 09:36.335
- Hey.
- You okay?

09:36.368 --> 09:39.471
I'm gonna grab a coffee.
You want anything?

09:39.505 --> 09:41.307
Yeah, I'll have another.

11:07.393 --> 11:10.129
Sarah?
Come on in.

11:14.734 --> 11:17.136
Have you ever had
any difficulty getting to sleep

11:17.169 --> 11:20.038
or staying asleep?

11:20.072 --> 11:23.442
Uh, lately. Yes.

11:23.475 --> 11:26.044
Okay.

11:26.078 --> 11:27.413
Do you drink coffee, tea,

11:27.446 --> 11:29.381
or any other
caffeinated beverages?

11:29.415 --> 11:31.283
And if so,
how many per day?

11:31.316 --> 11:33.285
Coffee.

11:33.318 --> 11:37.189
Usually I'll have about
three to six cups a day.

11:37.222 --> 11:38.624
Okay.

11:41.093 --> 11:44.029
Have you ever been diagnosed
with any sleeping disorders?

11:44.062 --> 11:46.598
Uh, sleepwalking?
Night terrors? Insomnia?

11:47.734 --> 11:49.501
No.

11:51.637 --> 11:53.705
Not officially.

11:53.740 --> 11:57.476
I used to sleepwalk as a kid,
but I haven't in years.

11:57.509 --> 11:59.344
Okay.

12:04.216 --> 12:07.052
And you'll be okay to attend
for the full two-month period?

12:07.085 --> 12:09.354
- Yes.
- Perfect.

12:14.092 --> 12:15.594
Great.

12:21.066 --> 12:23.635
So, we really just
show up and sleep?

12:23.669 --> 12:26.071
Yeah.
That's it.

12:26.104 --> 12:29.107
Well, uh, we'll have you
hooked up to a bunch of stuff

12:29.141 --> 12:31.043
and ask you a few questions
every morning.

12:31.076 --> 12:32.611
But other than that...

12:32.644 --> 12:35.380
we just need you
lying there in REM.

12:35.815 --> 12:37.282
REM?

12:38.250 --> 12:40.753
Uh, Rapid Eye Movement.

12:40.787 --> 12:44.389
It's the stage of sleep
where we dream the most vividly.

12:48.393 --> 12:50.329
Well, thanks for
coming down, Sarah.

12:50.362 --> 12:52.498
I'll send your application
over to our head of faculty

12:52.531 --> 12:54.767
and we'll likely
contact you tomorrow

12:54.801 --> 12:57.236
if you're chosen to be
a part of the study.

12:57.269 --> 12:59.071
When would
we be starting?

12:59.104 --> 13:00.807
Uh, Monday.

13:00.840 --> 13:02.241
I hope to see you then.

13:02.274 --> 13:04.209
Okay, bye.

13:17.523 --> 13:19.258
What?

13:19.291 --> 13:21.560
You okay?

13:21.593 --> 13:23.128
Yeah.
I'm good.

13:23.161 --> 13:24.831
Really?

13:24.864 --> 13:26.632
Really.

13:26.665 --> 13:29.134
'Cause, you know, it would
be okay if you weren't.

13:29.167 --> 13:30.737
I know.

13:47.754 --> 13:50.556
You have no idea
how good this feels.

13:50.589 --> 13:53.592
Just to be in a bed and...

13:53.625 --> 13:55.160
in a house.

13:55.193 --> 13:57.563
Thank you.

14:04.503 --> 14:06.305
Goodnight.

14:06.338 --> 14:08.707
Mm.
Sweet dreams.

16:43.730 --> 16:45.597
Can't believe it took me
this long to figure out

16:45.630 --> 16:48.366
how to make money
when sleeping.

16:49.634 --> 16:51.003
I'm sure your wife
is more than happy

16:51.037 --> 16:52.471
with the peace and quiet.

16:52.504 --> 16:54.841
- Well, I know I am.

17:01.546 --> 17:03.482
Um, are, uh...

17:03.515 --> 17:06.318
are you the only girl
in this study?

17:06.351 --> 17:08.453
Uh, no, there's
another in my room. Emily.

17:08.487 --> 17:09.588
Oh, cool.

17:09.621 --> 17:11.623
Is this your first
sleeping clinic?

17:12.390 --> 17:13.893
Yup.

17:13.926 --> 17:15.327
You guys?

17:15.360 --> 17:16.863
Yeah.

17:16.896 --> 17:18.030
I've done a couple.

17:20.032 --> 17:21.500
Oh, hey.

17:33.079 --> 17:34.814
What about you?

17:34.847 --> 17:35.882
I've, uh...

17:35.915 --> 17:38.650
I've been coming to these
things since I was five.

17:38.683 --> 17:40.953
Aaron and I
actually go way back.

17:43.388 --> 17:45.357
I was 16 when I
first started coming here.

17:47.526 --> 17:50.529
I guess ol' Meyer
loves to see us sleep.

17:54.566 --> 17:55.333
Meyer?

17:55.367 --> 17:57.402
Doctor Meyer.
He's, uh...

17:57.435 --> 17:59.671
He's head of the department.
You guys will meet him later.

17:59.704 --> 18:02.574
He, uh, usually does
the exit interviews.

18:25.765 --> 18:27.133
Perfect fit.

18:27.166 --> 18:29.969
Come, sit down and we'll
get your headset on.

18:35.640 --> 18:37.109
Everyone has to wear these?

18:37.143 --> 18:39.145
I'm afraid so.

18:39.178 --> 18:41.981
It's how we get
the information from you

18:42.014 --> 18:44.750
over to us
in the control room.

18:48.087 --> 18:49.554
Okay...

19:19.551 --> 19:21.153
Excuse me?

19:21.187 --> 19:23.122
Hi, sorry, um...

19:23.155 --> 19:25.724
Michael told me to
come down this way.

19:25.758 --> 19:26.625
Yeah, hi, Emily.

19:26.658 --> 19:27.860
You're in the right place,
don't worry.

19:27.894 --> 19:29.762
You can just have a seat and
I'll be with you in one second.

19:29.795 --> 19:31.529
Okay.
Thank you.

19:37.103 --> 19:38.838
- Hi.
- Hey.

19:43.642 --> 19:45.477
How many of us
are in the study?

19:45.510 --> 19:48.513
Uh, six.
Two females and four males.

19:50.582 --> 19:52.584
How come there's more guys?

19:53.685 --> 19:55.087
I can't tell you that.

19:56.956 --> 19:58.958
Well, what are you studying?

19:59.058 --> 20:01.193
I can't tell you that either.

20:04.830 --> 20:05.898
I told you to hurry.

20:05.932 --> 20:08.200
Well, Riff had me
installing the new drivers.

20:08.234 --> 20:09.969
It's okay.
You can watch me do Emily's,

20:10.002 --> 20:11.938
and then I'll get you to help
apply the guys' next door.

20:11.971 --> 20:13.672
- Cool.
- Okay.

20:13.705 --> 20:15.707
- Hi.
- Hey.

20:16.409 --> 20:18.077
I'll get Sarah
up and running

20:18.110 --> 20:18.978
so you can start
with Emily now.

20:19.011 --> 20:21.080
Great. Thank you.

20:26.584 --> 20:28.854
- I'll be right back.
- Okay.

20:37.830 --> 20:39.231
You're almost set.

20:55.014 --> 20:57.016
How long till
we're ready to go?

20:57.049 --> 20:58.683
I'd say
about another hour

20:58.717 --> 21:00.820
before everyone's
connected and settled.

21:00.853 --> 21:03.189
Okay.
Great.

21:20.006 --> 21:21.874
Stage one,

21:21.907 --> 21:23.508
the eyes close.

21:25.911 --> 21:28.646
A reduction in activity
between wakefulness.

21:31.017 --> 21:33.753
The patient can be awakened
without difficulty,

21:34.787 --> 21:36.756
but if woken at this stage,

21:36.789 --> 21:40.026
the person will not feel
as if they have slept.

21:42.728 --> 21:44.296
Many have
a feeling of falling

21:44.330 --> 21:47.599
during the first five
to ten minutes of sleep,

21:47.632 --> 21:50.936
which can cause a sudden
muscle contraction called...?

21:50.970 --> 21:52.304
Hypnic myoclonia?

21:52.338 --> 21:54.340
Very good, Lyle.

21:54.373 --> 21:57.777
Now, watch the EEG and the EOG.

21:57.810 --> 22:00.179
Some of them are
entering stage two.

22:02.982 --> 22:05.217
We'll now see
some peaks and valleys

22:05.251 --> 22:07.319
indicating periods
of muscle tone

22:07.353 --> 22:09.822
and muscle relaxation.

22:10.923 --> 22:14.326
The SYNC will also show us
a slowing of the heart rate

22:14.360 --> 22:16.829
and a decrease
in core temperature.

22:18.197 --> 22:21.367
Their bodies are preparing
them for deep sleep.

22:29.108 --> 22:31.944
Stage
three and four...

22:31.977 --> 22:34.046
Slow wave...

22:34.080 --> 22:35.680
Delta.

22:38.117 --> 22:40.352
Wake them now,
and for a moment,

22:40.386 --> 22:43.189
they'll have no idea
where they are.

22:45.690 --> 22:47.893
Now we wait.

22:48.894 --> 22:52.832
In a bit, we'll start
seeing some entry into REM.

23:09.915 --> 23:12.084
It's like clockwork.

23:12.118 --> 23:15.387
Yes. Well, for most
people it is.

23:17.756 --> 23:19.992
Are we ready?

23:20.025 --> 23:21.994
Recording.

23:39.178 --> 23:40.613
There.

23:42.181 --> 23:44.316
Whose feed is that?

23:46.752 --> 23:49.989
That's in A.
Sarah Dunn.

24:43.509 --> 24:46.979
And... do you
feel well rested?

24:47.980 --> 24:50.916
Yeah, I do actually.

24:50.950 --> 24:52.818
Uh, more rested
or less rested

24:52.851 --> 24:56.121
than you usually feel
when sleeping at home?

24:56.622 --> 24:58.991
Definitely more rested.

24:59.024 --> 25:01.060
That's great.

25:01.093 --> 25:02.328
Now just a few more questions

25:02.361 --> 25:03.529
and then we'll be
done for today.

25:03.562 --> 25:05.798
Okay.

25:52.945 --> 25:54.947
That good, huh?

26:25.577 --> 26:28.180
I read that
in one sitting.

26:28.213 --> 26:29.882
Hm.

26:29.915 --> 26:32.451
Couldn't put it down.

26:33.485 --> 26:35.087
It's really good.

26:36.989 --> 26:38.324
Yeah?

26:38.357 --> 26:40.592
Hm.
There's a...

26:40.626 --> 26:43.062
a kind of...

26:43.095 --> 26:44.830
a haunting sadness to it.

26:44.930 --> 26:46.465
You should definitely buy it.

26:47.166 --> 26:49.968
Have you read much
Philip K. Dick?

26:50.002 --> 26:52.471
No, not... not much.

26:52.504 --> 26:55.474
He was
completely paranoid.

26:55.507 --> 26:57.543
Genius concepts, though.

27:00.379 --> 27:02.848
His stuff will make you think.

27:04.516 --> 27:06.218
Thanks.

27:06.251 --> 27:08.387
I'll give him a try.

27:08.420 --> 27:10.956
You won't be sorry.

28:08.614 --> 28:09.581
You have to
get me a job there

28:09.615 --> 28:11.450
because I'm practically
a professional sleeper!

28:11.483 --> 28:13.685
If I got paid to sleep,
I can't even imagine...

28:13.719 --> 28:15.020
Wait, wait.
Wait, wait, wait.

28:15.053 --> 28:15.889
What?

28:15.921 --> 28:17.156
I'm trying
to avoid that guy.

28:17.189 --> 28:18.457
- Who?
- The...

28:18.490 --> 28:21.326
Up there in the trench coat
and the glasses.

28:21.360 --> 28:23.295
I met him in
a bookstore earlier.

28:23.328 --> 28:24.997
I just...

28:25.030 --> 28:27.065
I just don't feel like being
social, okay? Come on.

28:27.099 --> 28:28.367
Okay.

28:30.335 --> 28:32.704
You like him.

28:32.739 --> 28:34.940
Shut up!

28:37.509 --> 28:40.212
Okay, lie down.

28:45.451 --> 28:46.585
All set.

28:46.618 --> 28:49.354
Um, Anita will be by in a bit.

28:50.757 --> 28:52.624
Is Emily coming tonight?

28:52.658 --> 28:55.461
Uh, she's probably
just running late.

28:55.494 --> 28:56.628
Or dropped out.

28:56.662 --> 28:59.264
It happens all the time
on these things.

29:01.500 --> 29:03.602
Goodnight, Sarah.

29:03.635 --> 29:05.103
'Night.

31:37.790 --> 31:41.126
And... this one?

31:46.365 --> 31:48.333
No.

31:48.367 --> 31:50.369
Nothing.

31:50.402 --> 31:54.673
So, you have no reaction
to this image, correct?

31:54.706 --> 31:56.743
Correct.

31:56.776 --> 31:58.410
Okay.

32:03.548 --> 32:06.786
To be honest, I can't really
tell what any of these are.

32:06.819 --> 32:08.420
Yes, we know.

32:09.421 --> 32:10.823
Bear with us.

32:24.603 --> 32:26.773
I still don't really see or...

32:26.806 --> 32:28.540
or feel anything.

32:40.619 --> 32:41.888
Uh...

32:43.956 --> 32:47.794
I mean... some hands,
maybe, holding something?

33:06.746 --> 33:09.481
Is Emily still in the study?

33:10.348 --> 33:11.751
Probably not.

33:13.019 --> 33:14.754
Is something wrong?

33:15.788 --> 33:16.588
No.

33:17.056 --> 33:20.893
People usually lose interest
after the first couple nights.

33:20.927 --> 33:23.595
You know, realize they don't
like sleeping in a strange place

33:23.628 --> 33:25.732
or whatever, but...

33:25.765 --> 33:27.900
we'll have a replacement
in Room A as soon as we can.

33:27.934 --> 33:30.937
So you... you...
you talked to her, right?

33:32.805 --> 33:34.372
No.

33:34.406 --> 33:38.010
But this happens all the time.

33:38.044 --> 33:39.979
There are no-shows
in every cycle. It's just part...

33:40.012 --> 33:42.447
Guys...

33:42.481 --> 33:44.382
I'm sorry, but we have
four more of these to do

33:44.416 --> 33:46.585
until I get to
go home and sleep.

33:52.357 --> 33:55.762
Okay, Sarah.
Last one for today.

34:17.984 --> 34:19.651
Sarah?

34:19.684 --> 34:21.053
Sarah, are you...?

34:21.087 --> 34:23.089
Get Riff!
Hurry!

34:41.439 --> 34:43.441
Is she okay?

34:43.843 --> 34:45.677
She seems to be now.

34:52.450 --> 34:54.653
No...

35:09.135 --> 35:11.570
I wasn't following you.

35:11.603 --> 35:12.872
Really?

35:14.439 --> 35:17.442
Then how come I kept
seeing you everywhere?

35:18.010 --> 35:19.477
Hm...

35:21.881 --> 35:23.850
You were sitting there...

35:23.883 --> 35:26.585
watching me sleep.

35:26.618 --> 35:28.486
And you just thought,
"Hey...

35:28.520 --> 35:31.157
"Since I don't ever
leave my nerd den,

35:31.190 --> 35:34.160
"this is probably my best chance
to meet the future Mrs. Nerd,

35:34.193 --> 35:36.162
"so if I just
follow her around,

35:36.195 --> 35:39.999
"maybe she'll fall for my
magical fucking nerd charms!"

35:51.509 --> 35:55.480
Please don't quit our study
on account of my actions.

35:55.513 --> 36:01.153
I'm not quitting
because of you.

36:01.187 --> 36:03.789
I'm quitting because I just
had the worst panic attack

36:03.823 --> 36:08.526
of my life and none of you
people will tell me why.

36:11.197 --> 36:12.530
Okay, Sarah.

36:12.564 --> 36:15.500
Last one for today.

36:16.936 --> 36:18.670
Sarah?

36:18.703 --> 36:19.872
Sarah, are you...?

36:19.906 --> 36:21.774
Get Riff!
Hurry!

36:23.642 --> 36:25.644
And what did you
think would happen

36:25.677 --> 36:29.648
when you showed
these images to her?

36:29.681 --> 36:30.515
I...

36:30.548 --> 36:33.518
Dr. MEYER: This isn't
a joke, Anita.

36:33.551 --> 36:36.188
This is the first time
anyone has ever done this.

36:36.222 --> 36:39.524
And we have to be more than
careful about how it's handled.

36:39.557 --> 36:41.761
We'll either be
hailed or crucified

36:41.794 --> 36:44.696
based on our treatment
of this breakthrough.

36:44.730 --> 36:45.865
We never...

36:45.898 --> 36:48.200
There's no more
unauthorized testing, Anita.

36:48.234 --> 36:50.937
I don't care what Riff says.

36:50.970 --> 36:54.173
We just wanted to see
if they remember.

36:54.206 --> 36:56.909
Well, it's obvious
that they do.

36:56.943 --> 36:58.945
So...

36:58.978 --> 37:02.214
let's go back to acting
like scientists again, okay?

37:02.248 --> 37:04.516
Now, that means
collecting the data

37:04.549 --> 37:09.654
and then studying it
within the bounds of decency.

37:09.688 --> 37:14.260
We won't deviate
from your methods again.

37:14.293 --> 37:17.562
Thank you.

37:17.595 --> 37:20.132
I'll be by later tonight
to monitor.

38:10.016 --> 38:13.252
Hey.

38:13.285 --> 38:20.126
Zo?

38:20.159 --> 38:22.161
Hello?

38:46.252 --> 38:48.921
Young lady!
Wake up! Wake up!

38:50.688 --> 38:52.624
I didn't want to wake you,
but those boys,

38:52.657 --> 38:55.161
they stole something from you.

38:55.194 --> 38:56.362
What?

38:56.395 --> 38:58.230
The boys, they took
something from you,

38:58.264 --> 39:01.200
and then they ran off,
so I woke you.

39:01.233 --> 39:05.637
How long was I...

39:05.670 --> 39:08.706
Fuck!

39:12.078 --> 39:16.348
Oh, no, no, no...

39:32.832 --> 39:36.936
Zoe? Zoe!

39:36.969 --> 39:44.210
Please be home.
Please be home.

39:44.243 --> 39:47.413
Zo!
Zo, come on!

39:47.446 --> 39:49.714
Zoe, come on, please.

40:01.293 --> 40:03.295
Hey, nerd!

40:10.035 --> 40:12.905
Hey.

40:12.938 --> 40:17.910
What were those pictures
Anita showed me this morning?

40:17.943 --> 40:21.447
I can't tell you that.

40:21.480 --> 40:24.383
I'm not coming back
till you do.

40:24.416 --> 40:27.920
So, you're not quitting?

40:27.953 --> 40:31.723
I won't quit or tell anyone
you were stalking me...

40:31.757 --> 40:33.259
If... if...?

40:33.292 --> 40:35.895
If you tell me
what you're studying.

40:35.928 --> 40:39.899
- It's not happening.
- Please.

40:39.932 --> 40:43.335
I'm starting to
get scared, okay?

40:43.369 --> 40:47.306
Ever since this morning, it's...

40:47.339 --> 40:53.179
I have never felt so weird.

40:53.212 --> 40:54.914
But if I show you, it...

40:54.947 --> 40:56.749
it could completely
compromise the results...

40:56.782 --> 40:57.783
No, listen to me.

40:57.816 --> 41:00.953
I think your science project
is fucking me up!

41:04.523 --> 41:07.226
If I leave, doesn't that
compromise your results?

41:17.203 --> 41:20.039
All right, come on.

41:20.072 --> 41:21.974
Come on!

41:38.991 --> 41:41.794
I'm not kidding.

41:41.827 --> 41:45.331
If I show this to you...

41:45.364 --> 41:47.099
you cannot tell anyone.

41:57.243 --> 41:59.378
First off...

41:59.411 --> 42:02.948
you'll notice that I'm
putting this on my own head...

42:02.982 --> 42:04.116
so that you'll trust me
that there's nothing

42:04.149 --> 42:06.118
to be afraid of.

42:08.520 --> 42:11.557
Now, a few years ago,
some brilliant neuroscientist

42:11.590 --> 42:14.126
from Berkeley figured out
a way to decode the images

42:14.159 --> 42:15.995
our minds process...

42:16.028 --> 42:19.164
um, what we see...

42:19.198 --> 42:21.333
and export the data...

42:25.904 --> 42:32.278
...as a moving image.

42:32.311 --> 42:34.413
No way.

42:43.489 --> 42:45.457
That is so cool.

42:45.491 --> 42:52.264
It is!

42:52.298 --> 42:54.400
And... and I immediately thought
about where we could apply it.

42:54.433 --> 42:56.402
So I spent the last few years
tweaking this loaner

42:56.435 --> 43:00.439
to make it able to see
things even more amazing.

43:09.982 --> 43:13.319
You guys are
watching our dreams?

43:13.352 --> 43:15.487
Yes!

43:26.332 --> 43:28.100
Obviously
I can't show you yours,

43:28.133 --> 43:30.169
as we've already seen
what potentially happens

43:30.202 --> 43:35.207
when even a single frame
is recounted by the dreamer.

43:35.240 --> 43:38.077
I think I can safely cue up
a feed of someone else's

43:38.110 --> 43:39.611
from last night.

43:54.026 --> 43:56.095
Those are his dreams?

43:56.128 --> 43:57.930
No.
No, he's still falling asleep.

43:57.963 --> 44:00.666
See?

44:00.699 --> 44:03.635
These are hypnagogic
experiences.

44:03.669 --> 44:06.372
It's his brain trying to
make sense of the reduced input

44:06.405 --> 44:12.111
it's receiving as he
loses consciousness.

44:12.144 --> 44:14.980
That is so weird.

44:15.013 --> 44:17.249
And fascinating.

44:17.282 --> 44:19.251
Look at the pictures
and the shapes

44:19.284 --> 44:23.355
left floating around
in his mind.

44:23.389 --> 44:26.024
It's actually quite beautiful.

44:36.168 --> 44:37.669
If I remember correctly, I...

44:37.703 --> 44:40.005
I think he had a pretty
scary dream off the top.

44:40.038 --> 44:42.541
I might have to cut it short.

46:02.421 --> 46:06.658
Are my dreams that messed up?

46:06.692 --> 46:10.095
Sometimes.

46:10.128 --> 46:11.296
We all have nightmares.

46:25.677 --> 46:27.412
This is nuts.

46:35.687 --> 46:37.824
Don't you ever feel like
you're seeing something

46:37.857 --> 46:41.794
that you're not supposed to?

46:41.828 --> 46:48.400
I... I wouldn't be doing this if
I didn't have a reason, Sarah.

46:48.433 --> 46:49.501
Which is?

46:52.538 --> 46:55.407
Fuck.
Uh, we... we have to go.

46:55.440 --> 46:56.441
Come on.

47:05.617 --> 47:08.287
I held up my end...

47:18.731 --> 47:21.600
See you inside.

50:18.878 --> 50:20.880
That's new.

50:20.913 --> 50:23.015
It is.

50:23.049 --> 50:27.319
Let's clean it up a bit.

50:51.409 --> 50:53.712
How is this happening?

50:56.783 --> 50:58.683
They all have their own
unique hypnagogic

50:58.717 --> 51:03.923
and narrative episodes,
but eventually...

51:03.956 --> 51:06.691
they end up here like this.

51:28.114 --> 51:29.916
I've been seeing these
things in my own dreams

51:29.949 --> 51:32.985
since I was six years old.

51:33.019 --> 51:35.720
There's countless records
throughout history,

51:35.755 --> 51:37.990
across varying cultures
and yet for some reason

51:38.024 --> 51:41.928
we always figure out a way
to simply discount them as...

51:41.961 --> 51:43.763
just dreams.

51:46.732 --> 51:48.835
It's fucking scary

51:48.868 --> 51:51.703
finding what really
makes us tick.

52:15.027 --> 52:17.730
Lyle, can you grab this in 4K?

52:30.142 --> 52:32.044
- Dunn's coming out of REM.
- Fuck!

52:32.078 --> 52:34.512
Her pulse is
really fucking elevated.

52:57.036 --> 52:59.005
Sarah?

52:59.038 --> 53:00.505
Sarah!

53:07.980 --> 53:10.216
Sarah, are you okay?

53:10.249 --> 53:14.552
Fuck this place!
No, I'm not okay!

53:14.586 --> 53:16.188
Look, you
just had a nightmare.

53:16.222 --> 53:18.556
I know
I had a nightmare!

53:21.260 --> 53:24.797
What was it about, Anita?
Huh?

53:24.830 --> 53:26.631
Did you see them?

53:28.834 --> 53:31.837
Yeah, I know what you're doing
so you can shut the fuck up!

53:31.871 --> 53:33.005
I'm fucking done with this!

53:33.039 --> 53:36.809
I'll be right back.
Keep watching the others!

53:36.842 --> 53:39.678
Sarah!

53:39.711 --> 53:42.949
Your eye.

53:48.754 --> 53:50.722
What is going on, Riff?!

53:53.859 --> 53:55.828
- Nothing.
- Meyer's coming in at 2!

53:55.861 --> 53:56.996
What do I tell him?!

53:57.029 --> 53:59.597
Keep monitoring the others!
I'll be back before then!

55:55.680 --> 55:58.716
Bill!

55:58.751 --> 55:59.852
Is Zoe here tonight?

55:59.885 --> 56:01.053
Might be.
I just got here.

56:01.087 --> 56:03.155
Can I go in and check?

56:15.968 --> 56:19.105
- He has two minutes.
- Yep.

56:19.138 --> 56:22.875
Then he's gonna explain to us
how she knew.

56:22.908 --> 56:26.345
Yes. He is.

56:26.378 --> 56:29.381
I think one of
the guys in C is waking up.

56:35.287 --> 56:36.989
It's Will.

56:37.022 --> 56:38.757
They're both waking up.

56:47.466 --> 56:49.301
No...

56:49.335 --> 56:51.103
Look at the room...

56:51.137 --> 56:55.841
Their vitals.

56:55.875 --> 56:57.143
It's happening.

57:04.283 --> 57:06.285
Lyle, get Riff.
Right now!

57:17.429 --> 57:19.765
What's going on?

58:31.837 --> 58:32.738
Where's Riff again?

58:34.006 --> 58:35.241
He had to run home
for something,

58:35.274 --> 58:39.378
but he should
be back any minute.

58:39.411 --> 58:42.982
Well, I just
don't want him to miss this.

58:43.015 --> 58:46.118
This is exactly what
he's been waiting for.

59:40.172 --> 59:41.974
Hey!
Is she okay?

1:00:14.473 --> 1:00:17.042
I feel bad about having
them go through this.

1:00:17.076 --> 1:00:19.111
Must be horrible.

1:00:19.144 --> 1:00:21.480
It is.

1:00:21.513 --> 1:00:24.316
But this is a natural function.

1:00:24.350 --> 1:00:25.584
And if we're going
to understand it,

1:00:25.617 --> 1:00:28.220
we need this data.

1:00:28.253 --> 1:00:30.089
These images...

1:00:30.122 --> 1:00:35.361
they prove a kind of a primal
connection to this icon.

1:00:35.394 --> 1:00:39.932
A unified fear of
this shadow with eyes.

1:01:12.164 --> 1:01:15.167
Their vitals
aren't changing.

1:01:15.200 --> 1:01:19.505
Discreetly get in there
and re-connect their SYNCS.

1:01:19.538 --> 1:01:21.573
Should we wake them?

1:01:38.690 --> 1:01:41.160
There.

1:02:00.579 --> 1:02:02.181
No fuckin' way.

1:02:02.214 --> 1:02:03.482
What?

1:02:10.489 --> 1:02:11.490
Michael...

1:02:11.523 --> 1:02:17.429
Michael, what is it?

1:11:30.149 --> 1:11:31.616
Wake up!

1:11:31.649 --> 1:11:35.287
Wake up!
Wake up!

1:11:35.321 --> 1:11:37.923
You gotta wake up!
You gotta wake up!

1:11:57.675 --> 1:11:59.912
Hey.

1:11:59.945 --> 1:12:02.882
Hey.

1:13:06.145 --> 1:13:08.347
Um, I'll be right back.

1:13:46.485 --> 1:13:49.321
Oh, weird question.

1:13:49.355 --> 1:13:54.760
Can I sleep on
your couch tonight?

1:13:54.793 --> 1:13:57.163
Of course.

1:13:57.196 --> 1:14:00.733
I lost my phone.

1:14:00.766 --> 1:14:03.869
And I have nowhere else to go.

1:14:25.324 --> 1:14:27.226
Why "Riff"?

1:14:29.128 --> 1:14:31.197
You ever see
the Rocky Horror?

1:14:31.230 --> 1:14:34.066
Of course.

1:14:34.099 --> 1:14:39.338
You remember Riff-Raff?

1:14:39.371 --> 1:14:42.074
Oh...

1:14:42.107 --> 1:14:45.444
I get it.
You're Meyer's Igor.

1:14:49.648 --> 1:14:51.517
You know,
you're smart for your age.

1:14:51.550 --> 1:14:53.085
I'm 18.

1:15:03.095 --> 1:15:06.198
I saw your dream.

1:16:54.473 --> 1:16:57.042
Sarah?

1:16:57.076 --> 1:16:58.344
Oh, Sarah...

1:17:17.563 --> 1:17:21.633
Are there any relatives,
next-of-kin we can contact?

1:17:21.667 --> 1:17:24.670
I don't know.
I don't know her very well.

1:20:45.470 --> 1:20:48.173
Hello?!

1:20:48.206 --> 1:20:50.409
Nurse!

1:20:56.515 --> 1:20:57.784
Hello?!

1:21:06.458 --> 1:21:07.860
Where is everyone?

1:21:07.894 --> 1:21:08.861
On the second floor,
I... I...

1:21:08.895 --> 1:21:10.562
I have a friend that's
being treated up there

1:21:10.596 --> 1:21:11.731
and I don't know
where she is now.

1:21:11.764 --> 1:21:13.498
There's no nurses
at the front desk.

1:21:13.532 --> 1:21:14.600
What's your friend's name?

1:21:14.633 --> 1:21:17.469
Dunn.
Sarah Dunn.

1:21:17.502 --> 1:21:20.205
- Sarah...
- Dunn.

1:21:20.238 --> 1:21:22.775
Sarah... Dunn.

1:21:22.809 --> 1:21:24.877
She's in 237.

1:21:24.911 --> 1:21:26.012
No!
No, she's not.

1:21:26.045 --> 1:21:28.380
She's... that's what I'm
telling you, she's not there!

1:21:28.413 --> 1:21:30.349
Sir, please calm down.

1:21:30.382 --> 1:21:32.351
We will find out
where she is.

1:21:32.384 --> 1:21:33.485
Let me call a nurse
on the second...

1:21:33.518 --> 1:21:34.921
But there's
no one up there!

1:21:34.954 --> 1:21:36.923
I'm tell...
I'm telling you.

1:21:48.266 --> 1:21:50.636
Jerry, can you run up
to the second and

1:21:50.669 --> 1:21:52.872
find Rachel or Kiki for me?

1:21:52.905 --> 1:21:56.809
This gentleman's looking
for a patient's whereabouts.

1:21:56.843 --> 1:21:58.644
I told you there's
no one up there.

1:21:58.677 --> 1:21:59.946
They
probably had to move her

1:21:59.979 --> 1:22:01.914
due to tonight's
staffing shortage.

1:22:01.948 --> 1:22:04.416
Um, why don't you take
a seat over by the desk

1:22:04.449 --> 1:22:08.387
and I'll give you a call
when we have her new location.

1:22:08.420 --> 1:22:10.255
Okay, thanks.
I just...

1:22:10.288 --> 1:22:12.357
I'm... I'm just...
I'm worried about her.

1:23:37.910 --> 1:23:39.377
Sarah!

1:23:43.783 --> 1:23:46.251
Sarah!
It's me, Jeremy!

1:23:50.555 --> 1:23:52.992
Sarah!

1:24:05.905 --> 1:24:06.906
Sarah...

1:24:11.676 --> 1:24:12.677
Sarah...

1:24:18.818 --> 1:24:20.552
It's me, Jeremy.

1:24:21.653 --> 1:24:22.955
Wake up.

1:24:25.925 --> 1:24:27.392
Wake up.

1:24:31.563 --> 1:24:32.832
Augh!

1:24:50.983 --> 1:24:53.552
Where the fuck
have you been?!

1:24:53.585 --> 1:24:55.822
Look, I can't explain right now.
Are you at the lab?

1:24:55.855 --> 1:24:59.091
Yes! I'm here
and I'm cleaning up your mess.

1:24:59.125 --> 1:25:01.326
I... I really
need you right now.

1:25:01.961 --> 1:25:05.832
No! No! You have
fucked up all of our lives!

1:25:05.865 --> 1:25:07.432
We'll be lucky if we
ever do another study...

1:25:07.465 --> 1:25:08.734
I know, I'm sorry,
it's just...

1:25:08.768 --> 1:25:09.869
<i>something's happened
to Sarah Dunn and I...</i>

1:25:09.902 --> 1:25:11.703
<i>I just really need
you to come out...</i>

1:25:11.737 --> 1:25:14.539
What did you do?

1:25:17.009 --> 1:25:18.744
I really fucked up.

1:25:19.145 --> 1:25:21.346
Just one more thing
and we're done.

1:25:23.015 --> 1:25:24.616
Anita, please.

1:25:25.985 --> 1:25:28.855
Then we're done.

1:27:04.716 --> 1:27:07.585
- What the fuck, Riff?!
- Where's the stuff?

1:27:07.619 --> 1:27:09.021
The trunk.

1:27:43.122 --> 1:27:45.257
Why don't we take
her back to the hospital?

1:27:45.291 --> 1:27:47.259
'Cause
she's not safe there.

1:27:47.293 --> 1:27:48.593
They have no clue
what's happening to her.

1:27:48.626 --> 1:27:50.495
No more than we do.

1:27:54.066 --> 1:27:55.667
It's up.

1:28:10.750 --> 1:28:12.617
It's a nightmare.

1:28:13.953 --> 1:28:17.323
It's... it's good.
It can help us get her out.

1:28:17.356 --> 1:28:19.825
You keep watching her.
I'll make sure that she's safe.

1:29:11.977 --> 1:29:14.712
So, we try to wake her at
the height of her nightmare?

1:29:15.848 --> 1:29:17.116
Yes.

1:29:18.716 --> 1:29:20.652
The body tries to
reject death in dreams.

1:29:20.685 --> 1:29:22.221
You wake up.

1:29:22.687 --> 1:29:24.622
What if you're wrong?

1:29:26.859 --> 1:29:28.761
I don't know.

1:30:06.265 --> 1:30:07.733
Anything?

1:30:07.900 --> 1:30:09.401
Nothing yet.

1:30:10.236 --> 1:30:13.839
Look, how much further should
we really let her continue...

1:30:13.873 --> 1:30:15.407
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

1:31:18.938 --> 1:31:21.073
This isn't
making any sense.

1:31:21.106 --> 1:31:22.474
I thought she was headed
somewhere familiar, or...

1:31:22.508 --> 1:31:24.709
Wait!
I see something.

1:31:57.843 --> 1:32:00.379
I've never seen or
dreamt of this many before.

1:32:02.681 --> 1:32:05.117
When one of them comes
close or touches her,

1:32:05.150 --> 1:32:07.519
she'll expel herself
from the dream.

1:33:28.067 --> 1:33:30.069
Riff, I don't want
to do this anymore.

1:33:30.102 --> 1:33:32.304
Let's call a cab, okay?
Let's get out of here, leave!

1:33:38.977 --> 1:33:40.646
Just...
just keep watching.

1:34:34.066 --> 1:34:35.334
Sarah...

1:34:35.869 --> 1:34:38.404
Hey, I'm right here.
I'm here.

1:34:38.437 --> 1:34:41.306
What happened?

1:34:41.340 --> 1:34:44.443
I'm so sorry.
I'm so sorry.

1:34:44.476 --> 1:34:46.712
We couldn't wake you...

1:34:46.746 --> 1:34:48.514
We couldn't wake you.

1:34:48.547 --> 1:34:51.049
You saw?

1:34:51.083 --> 1:34:54.019
- You saw?
- Yes.

1:34:58.624 --> 1:35:00.492
I'm so sorry.
I'm sorry.

1:35:03.562 --> 1:35:07.266
I'm so sorry.
I'm so sorry.

1:35:39.732 --> 1:35:42.201
Are you certain this
is the way that we came in?

1:35:46.773 --> 1:35:48.507
Where did you get this?

1:35:49.809 --> 1:35:52.511
I found it
out in the field.

1:35:52.544 --> 1:35:54.279
This is my phone.

1:35:55.748 --> 1:35:57.583
You lost it out here?

1:35:57.616 --> 1:35:59.451
I've never been here!

1:35:59.485 --> 1:36:01.587
Look, maybe you've had
an episode like this before

1:36:01.620 --> 1:36:03.121
and you came and you dropped...

1:36:03.222 --> 1:36:03.722
What time is it?

1:36:09.628 --> 1:36:11.096
What the fuck?

1:36:13.265 --> 1:36:15.133
What time
does it say it is?

1:36:45.697 --> 1:36:47.699
Run!

1:36:54.841 --> 1:36:57.676
No!
No...

1:37:03.148 --> 1:37:04.683
Just keep breathing.

1:37:07.553 --> 1:37:09.521
No...!
