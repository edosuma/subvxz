00:18.756 --> 00:20.076
Is that necessary?

00:20.556 --> 00:23.876
He's a garden variety
scumbag, not Hannibal Lecter.

00:23.996 --> 00:24.996
Procedure, Ma'am.

00:25.076 --> 00:26.356
Procedure, ma'am.

00:27.556 --> 00:29.116
Oh, isn't this adorable?

00:29.996 --> 00:32.356
Lover boy's come all this
way to see you in the rain.

00:32.516 --> 00:34.396
Or is it me you've come to see, Carl?

00:36.636 --> 00:37.636
Take him.

00:41.356 --> 00:42.356
How was your flight?

00:42.556 --> 00:45.916
He snores. Doesn't smell too good either.

00:46.036 --> 00:48.316
And here I thought we had a real nice time.

00:48.596 --> 00:49.612
I didn't say it wasn't nice.

00:49.636 --> 00:51.556
Bringing you here to face
an international court

00:51.716 --> 00:53.276
is one of the highlights of my life.

00:53.636 --> 00:55.316
Then, sugar, you need a better life.

00:55.476 --> 00:56.476
Hey.

00:57.796 --> 00:58.876
Home sweet home.

01:05.636 --> 01:07.836
Did he seem too unconcerned to you.

01:10.316 --> 01:12.676
He's covering. Brave face.

01:13.276 --> 01:14.572
I don't know, the whole way here,

01:14.596 --> 01:16.196
it felt like he knew something I didn't.

01:16.236 --> 01:19.956
Amanda, he's a pompous piece
of shit who wants you doing

01:20.316 --> 01:22.716
exactly what you are now.

01:23.476 --> 01:24.996
Right. Right...

01:25.156 --> 01:27.196
He's going to be in prison
for the rest of his life.

01:27.596 --> 01:29.716
If not here, then back in New York.

01:30.276 --> 01:31.276
Want to get a drink?

01:32.116 --> 01:33.996
Not unless you want me
to lose my two year chip.

01:36.036 --> 01:37.036
Sober?

01:37.476 --> 01:38.596
Mm-hmm.

01:38.876 --> 01:42.836
It's kinda nice not to have to go
out and find my car every morning.

01:44.636 --> 01:47.556
I'm off morphine. Are
we getting old and dull?

01:47.676 --> 01:49.716
I don't know about you,
but I actually feel younger.

01:51.396 --> 01:54.516
Louis told me you still
haven't gotten that apartment.

01:54.636 --> 01:56.516
But I booked you into a really nice hotel.

01:56.716 --> 01:59.596
Hmm, good. That's good.

02:00.916 --> 02:03.356
Um... tour of The Hague?

02:16.956 --> 02:17.996
Hotel Leopold.

02:18.636 --> 02:20.196
Do we still have our understanding?

02:21.476 --> 02:24.036
Of course. Nothing has changed.

02:24.916 --> 02:26.916
Then do not deviate from the plan.

03:22.356 --> 03:24.796
I must save them! I don't
want to do this anymore.

03:34.036 --> 03:35.036
Hey.

04:38.836 --> 04:40.556
Does anyone know what is happening?

04:54.596 --> 04:58.036
Hey, Lech is my friend! I
think there is a mistake.

04:58.276 --> 05:00.516
I was only supposed to be
seeing someone about a job.

05:05.276 --> 05:06.276
Drag him inside.

05:10.196 --> 05:11.276
Any more questions?

05:46.596 --> 05:47.596
Thank you.

05:50.596 --> 05:52.436
Phillip Genovese...

05:53.796 --> 05:57.796
You were brought to
Europe to stand trial here.

05:58.436 --> 06:01.636
Yeah, I know. It's an elite bracket.

06:02.236 --> 06:05.036
You requested my appearance, Mr. Genovese.

06:06.036 --> 06:07.956
It is going to be a very short one

06:08.716 --> 06:12.556
if this is not going to be
anything more than badinage.

06:12.676 --> 06:16.876
- Badi... Badi-what?
- Badinage. "Playful banter."

06:17.116 --> 06:21.116
Oh. Oh, no, this is gonna be
much more than playful banter.

06:21.396 --> 06:22.876
What if I had something to offer you?

06:23.276 --> 06:24.276
That I would want?

06:26.076 --> 06:28.316
I would find that very
difficult to believe.

06:28.756 --> 06:30.196
The Eleutheria.

06:32.036 --> 06:35.116
That sank off Greece? How many people died?

06:35.476 --> 06:36.476
54.

06:38.476 --> 06:41.316
Six of those women were
thrown overboard on the way.

06:42.436 --> 06:45.596
The others were all locked
in the hold as it sank.

06:47.036 --> 06:49.476
They were being transported
against their will.

06:50.676 --> 06:53.836
- Human trafficking.
- Yeah, a tragic event.

06:54.116 --> 06:55.756
And you had something to do with it?

06:55.916 --> 06:57.876
Hey, hey, hey, wasn't my boat.

06:58.796 --> 07:03.076
But suppose I could tell you whose it was?

07:03.676 --> 07:06.756
And not just the registered
name, but the real owner

07:07.036 --> 07:08.636
of the boat and cargo.

07:12.196 --> 07:14.796
What would be in it for me?

07:16.676 --> 07:18.156
Give me the name.

07:19.396 --> 07:22.636
It's a really big name.
You might cream yourself.

07:26.316 --> 07:28.156
Aleksander Robak.

07:33.396 --> 07:37.076
Oh, look at that reaction,
yeah. That's... that's it.

07:38.716 --> 07:40.996
There are a great many people
in your line of endeavour

07:41.876 --> 07:45.436
who would try to utilize
the name Aleksander Robak.

07:46.076 --> 07:47.716
I'm gonna give you a taste.

07:48.636 --> 07:51.676
A little town called Nysa, Poland.

07:52.276 --> 07:54.916
That'll be your first
stop on a very long trip.

08:02.996 --> 08:04.796
- Figured you'd be here.
- Something's wrong.

08:05.276 --> 08:06.876
- What's wrong?
- I went to get Genovese

08:07.036 --> 08:08.636
for his extradition arraignment,

08:08.916 --> 08:11.276
and the prosecutor told me
that he's on a special hold.

08:11.916 --> 08:14.796
- What prosecutor?
- Your boss's wife, Rebecca Daniel.

08:17.436 --> 08:18.956
Carl, we've been waiting for you.

08:19.116 --> 08:21.876
- Yeah, I have something that...
- I think you may want to hear this.

08:22.356 --> 08:23.356
Both of you.

08:26.076 --> 08:28.756
This man is our enemy.

08:29.876 --> 08:32.515
His name is Aleksander Robak.

08:33.356 --> 08:37.035
In the 80s, he worked for
the Polish Security Services,

08:37.635 --> 08:38.876
their secret police.

08:39.556 --> 08:44.196
Then he capitalized on the fall
of communism and made millions.

08:44.676 --> 08:46.076
And now he is one of the

08:46.276 --> 08:48.836
most notorious crime bosses east of Berlin.

08:49.156 --> 08:52.356
I have sent Sebastian Berger
to Berlin to follow some leads.

08:52.676 --> 08:53.756
Leads on what?

08:53.916 --> 08:54.916
Six months ago,

08:55.876 --> 08:58.836
the Greek-flagged ship
The Eleutheria sank.

08:58.996 --> 09:01.276
With a cargo hold filled
with trafficked women.

09:01.396 --> 09:03.996
Yes. 54 women.

09:05.036 --> 09:06.316
All of them drowned.

09:06.516 --> 09:09.036
- We have a lead on that?
- We have an informant.

09:10.316 --> 09:13.156
No... no way.

09:13.876 --> 09:16.796
- You think you know Genovese?
- Bear me out.

09:18.236 --> 09:22.356
One of Robak's most lucrative operations

09:23.116 --> 09:25.076
is the trafficking of young men,

09:25.356 --> 09:28.796
conscripted in Europe and
then transported to the Gulf

09:29.196 --> 09:31.156
where they serve as slaves.

09:31.356 --> 09:34.716
I didn't bring Genovese here so
the ICC could play games with him.

09:34.836 --> 09:37.196
I do not play games, Detective.

09:38.676 --> 09:40.076
He gave me something small.

09:40.836 --> 09:44.876
If it bears fruit we will give
him something small in return,

09:45.196 --> 09:46.916
and then he will give us something more.

09:47.076 --> 09:49.156
- Who is "we?"
- "We" is the two of you.

09:50.036 --> 09:53.116
He is your prisoner. No
one knows him like you do.

09:53.876 --> 09:56.276
I need the two of you to work him with me.

09:56.396 --> 09:57.396
And are you

09:58.436 --> 10:00.116
sure that it's not you

10:00.756 --> 10:03.396
who is being worked?
Because this is what he does.

10:03.796 --> 10:06.356
It is not going to cost us anything more

10:06.716 --> 10:09.276
than a little bit of time
while we check out the lead.

10:09.476 --> 10:10.476
What's the lead?

10:10.756 --> 10:11.756
Are you serious?

10:12.116 --> 10:14.796
- Are you really serious here?
- If he hasn't promised him anything,

10:15.356 --> 10:16.356
what does it hurt

10:16.796 --> 10:19.356
to find out what the lead is?
Please, sir, what is the lead?

10:19.516 --> 10:24.076
He told me that all of the
journeys begin in a hotel in Nysa.

10:24.676 --> 10:26.636
That's a small town in western Poland.

10:26.756 --> 10:27.956
- Eva...
- Yes, sir.

10:28.076 --> 10:30.396
Check-in undercover and
look around this hotel.

10:30.756 --> 10:31.876
I'll see what I can find.

10:33.236 --> 10:36.996
Tommy, Arabela, do back-up.
Touch base with the locals.

10:37.276 --> 10:38.716
You're making a deal with the devil.

10:39.676 --> 10:40.676
A devil.

10:41.636 --> 10:43.476
And it won't be my first one.

10:46.316 --> 10:48.556
- I don't really get this.
- This?

10:49.036 --> 10:52.476
The whole trafficking
thing. Isn't it expensive?

10:53.076 --> 10:57.236
You ship a bunch of guys thousands
of miles from home to be slaves.

10:57.516 --> 10:58.516
Why bother?

10:59.076 --> 11:01.076
If you want to force some men into slavery,

11:01.236 --> 11:02.596
there must sources closer to home.

11:03.076 --> 11:04.436
I guess the buyer is choosy.

11:05.916 --> 11:07.436
These are not just

11:07.756 --> 11:11.276
any old slaves to dig
roads or lift heavy loads.

11:11.956 --> 11:15.396
These are personal slaves, an elite.

11:15.876 --> 11:20.156
Some Emir or ex-pat billionaire
especially wants Europeans.

11:21.756 --> 11:22.476
Yeah...

11:22.596 --> 11:23.596
Oh, man.

11:24.196 --> 11:26.596
This world just keeps
getting weirder and weirder.

11:46.661 --> 11:47.661
Hello.

11:47.981 --> 11:49.101
- Hi.
- Are you checking in?

11:51.281 --> 11:53.201
Um... I'm sorry, I don't speak Polish.

11:53.321 --> 11:55.441
- That's okay. Are you checking in?
- Yes, yes.

11:55.601 --> 11:56.801
- Can I help you?
- Yeah, sure.

12:01.681 --> 12:02.681
Thanks.

12:07.441 --> 12:10.841
Investigator Berger? Staff
Sergeant Malinowski, Nysa Police.

12:10.961 --> 12:11.681
Nice to meet you.

12:11.841 --> 12:13.401
Your colleagues arrived 20 minutes ago.

12:13.841 --> 12:14.841
All right.

12:21.641 --> 12:24.241
He's a good man. Dorn.

12:24.681 --> 12:26.081
What difference does that make?

12:27.921 --> 12:31.041
Look, if we can use Genovese
to bring down more traffickers,

12:32.801 --> 12:34.161
that's not a bad thing.

12:34.361 --> 12:37.201
I told you last night, I had
a feeling the entire way here

12:37.761 --> 12:39.521
that he knew something I didn't.

12:39.961 --> 12:41.281
He had an ace to play.

12:42.481 --> 12:43.601
Have you thought about this?

12:45.001 --> 12:48.121
How the hell did he even
know who this Dorn is?

12:48.601 --> 12:50.361
He came here with a plan.

12:50.561 --> 12:52.761
He sought Dorn out, not
the other way around.

12:53.921 --> 12:55.081
He had something to tell him,

12:55.201 --> 12:57.121
something he knew Dorn
would be interested in.

12:58.441 --> 13:00.761
We are so far behind him on this one,

13:01.361 --> 13:03.121
and you and I both know
that is not the place

13:03.241 --> 13:04.641
you wanna be with Phillip Genovese.

13:05.281 --> 13:06.681
It's how people get hurt.

13:10.281 --> 13:11.561
How long will you be staying?

13:11.721 --> 13:12.801
Only a day or two.

13:15.081 --> 13:16.681
But I heard nice things about this town.

13:17.041 --> 13:18.121
It's very quiet here.

13:18.441 --> 13:20.401
Well, at Christmas things pick up again.

13:24.041 --> 13:26.481
- The room has a nice view.
- Great. Thank you.

13:30.721 --> 13:31.921
All by yourselves here?

13:32.681 --> 13:34.601
It's a lot of work for
just you and your boss.

13:35.001 --> 13:36.001
He's my father.

13:37.161 --> 13:39.641
- Tough working for family.
- Yeah.

13:45.001 --> 13:46.001
Wow.

13:47.161 --> 13:48.161
It's very nice.

13:49.161 --> 13:50.321
Do you need anything else?

13:50.441 --> 13:52.841
Uh, no, I'm okay for now. Maybe later.

13:53.241 --> 13:54.521
- Call the desk.
- All right.

13:54.801 --> 13:55.881
Can I ask you something?

13:57.961 --> 14:01.081
I mean, I know it's none
of my business, but, uh...

14:01.321 --> 14:02.321
are you all right?

14:03.241 --> 14:04.441
You seem kind of sad.

14:06.441 --> 14:10.081
Yeah. You're right. It's
none of your business.

14:16.601 --> 14:19.121
I told you before. I don't know anything.

14:19.401 --> 14:22.921
- You cannot keep coming around here.
- I have looked everywhere for him.

14:23.241 --> 14:26.761
You are disturbing my guests. Go
away or I will call the police.

14:26.961 --> 14:28.441
- Please!
- Go away!

14:30.961 --> 14:34.001
There are not many cameras in this town,

14:34.161 --> 14:36.481
but there is everything
from the last two weeks,

14:36.641 --> 14:38.481
- seven cameras.
- Why only seven cameras?

14:39.281 --> 14:42.561
We are a small town. We don't
have the budget Gdansk has.

14:42.921 --> 14:44.441
Someone paid for a lot of tech.

14:45.001 --> 14:48.401
Oh. Most of it second-hand.

14:50.641 --> 14:53.201
Seven cameras will take
weeks to watch it anyway.

14:53.321 --> 14:54.681
Not with my equipment.

14:58.201 --> 14:59.641
- Is there something else?
- No.

15:01.281 --> 15:03.201
Then we wouldn't mind getting to work.

15:03.361 --> 15:08.321
Oh, yes. If you need anything,
I'm up at the front. See you later.

15:09.561 --> 15:10.561
How was Berlin?

15:10.721 --> 15:12.041
Couple of cases like this.

15:14.161 --> 15:17.361
They took their cargo by boat.
It avoids all the borders.

15:17.641 --> 15:19.801
- I meant did you see your son?
- Oh.

15:21.081 --> 15:24.361
Yeah, I did. It was... nice.

15:27.201 --> 15:28.441
Okay...

15:30.201 --> 15:32.721
Let's see what cameras we have around Nysa.

15:51.681 --> 15:54.601
Madam? Hi. Can I talk to you?

15:55.761 --> 15:57.361
Me? About what?

15:58.721 --> 16:03.001
I saw what happened at the
hotel. I'm a police officer.

16:08.121 --> 16:09.561
So your son is missing?

16:10.081 --> 16:11.801
The police think I'm just a silly mother.

16:12.641 --> 16:17.281
They say my son is having fun,
doesn't have time to speak to me.

16:17.401 --> 16:20.601
They say modern young men,
they don't call their mothers.

16:20.761 --> 16:24.961
But I called him, four
days now, just voicemail.

16:25.681 --> 16:27.561
He said he was working at the hotel,

16:28.121 --> 16:32.241
and then maybe getting a job
on a ship, for the winter.

16:34.281 --> 16:38.761
I've been out here for two days,
and he never comes in or out.

16:39.081 --> 16:40.401
How did he get this job?

16:40.801 --> 16:44.841
Andreas met a man in a... a bar.

16:45.081 --> 16:48.361
- You know, a special bar.
- Yeah.

16:48.641 --> 16:49.801
I didn't ask.

16:51.641 --> 16:53.121
I don't like to pry.

16:53.361 --> 16:55.401
So since your son came here,

16:55.721 --> 16:58.321
he suddenly stopped answering
your calls, is that correct?

16:58.641 --> 17:00.881
It's bad, isn't it?

17:01.041 --> 17:02.321
No, it might be nothing.

17:03.241 --> 17:04.521
We don't know yet.

17:05.521 --> 17:07.641
Do you have a photo of your son?

17:10.840 --> 17:11.840
Do you see the picture?

17:12.601 --> 17:13.320
Yes.

17:13.521 --> 17:15.761
That was taken on the last
day his mother heard from him.

17:16.080 --> 17:18.921
Over the past five years, there
have been a handful of cases,

17:19.241 --> 17:20.401
all missing young men,

17:20.761 --> 17:23.560
where the last place they were
known to be was Nysa, Poland.

17:24.001 --> 17:25.681
Supposedly working at the hotel.

17:25.921 --> 17:26.921
Hotel Leopold.

17:27.281 --> 17:28.881
They check in, but they don't check out.

17:30.161 --> 17:31.481
What? They don't.

17:31.881 --> 17:33.881
Five missing in one small town?

17:34.041 --> 17:35.721
How come we've never heard of this before?

17:36.041 --> 17:39.081
Because only Andreas Metaxis has
a mother going frantic with worry.

17:39.361 --> 17:41.161
The rest are just young men who left home.

17:41.361 --> 17:44.241
"Come work in this lovely little
town, in this nice little hotel."

17:44.401 --> 17:47.561
Yeah, free food and board
and a little bit of money.

17:47.881 --> 17:50.162
And they're all together,
thinking that life isn't so bad.

17:50.401 --> 17:51.481
Until it is.

17:52.121 --> 17:55.001
Eva, I'm going to need a proper statement

17:55.161 --> 17:57.081
from the mother to take before the Court.

17:57.281 --> 18:00.721
Yes, sir. I already told her to go
to the police and ask for Arabela.

18:01.081 --> 18:02.481
I'll go out front and wait for her.

18:02.921 --> 18:04.361
The mother's been watching for days.

18:04.401 --> 18:06.001
I mean, he won't still be here, will he?

18:06.121 --> 18:08.921
- It does not matter.
- And why is that?

18:09.361 --> 18:12.121
Because it's not a single rescue mission.

18:12.881 --> 18:14.361
It's about the larger picture.

18:15.441 --> 18:20.441
If Robak is actually behind this,
we have a real chance to stop him.

18:20.561 --> 18:21.921
Not a single rescue mission?

18:22.441 --> 18:24.441
At least our priorities
are in the right place.

18:27.435 --> 18:28.555
Is Dorn right?

18:30.875 --> 18:33.035
If Robak's as bad as he says,

18:34.515 --> 18:36.395
yeah, probably.

18:36.955 --> 18:38.355
Justice has scales.

18:39.675 --> 18:40.915
Things have to be weighed.

18:41.675 --> 18:45.915
Hey, it's not like we're giving
Genovese the keys to the city.

18:46.115 --> 18:47.915
- I don't want to give him anything.
- I know.

18:48.235 --> 18:49.755
- You want him to suffer.
- I do.

18:53.995 --> 18:56.355
Not if it means a bunch
of boys get sold to some...

18:57.595 --> 18:58.595
Sheikh.

19:03.115 --> 19:04.795
You are Andreas?

19:05.115 --> 19:06.395
Y... yes.

19:07.315 --> 19:10.475
Your friend Lech, he let us take you,

19:11.395 --> 19:12.875
just like everybody else.

19:14.435 --> 19:18.195
Bother me again, and you will all suffer.

19:25.715 --> 19:26.715
There is something.

19:28.875 --> 19:31.635
I ran a facial recognition
program over the footage to see

19:31.795 --> 19:33.715
if any of the cameras picked up Andreas.

19:34.155 --> 19:35.155
You got him?

19:35.715 --> 19:36.715
Looks like it.

19:42.035 --> 19:43.755
Outside the train station.

19:44.595 --> 19:45.595
Who's that?

19:46.595 --> 19:47.595
Lech Sikora.

19:48.635 --> 19:51.075
- Who?
- It is the son of the hotel manager.

19:52.515 --> 19:53.835
Hotel Leopold.

20:07.995 --> 20:08.995
I'm sorry.

20:09.595 --> 20:11.875
- Can I help you?
- I was wondering if the bar is open.

20:12.355 --> 20:13.715
Uh... yeah.

20:13.995 --> 20:15.555
- Come over, I'll show you.
- Thank you.

20:23.035 --> 20:25.475
I can't find any footage
from the Hotel Leopold camera.

20:26.595 --> 20:27.755
There is not one.

20:28.275 --> 20:30.035
There's a camera on the
wall just outside it.

20:30.195 --> 20:32.195
- How do you know that?
- I saw it.

20:32.555 --> 20:34.315
- I have the statement.
- What statement?

20:34.515 --> 20:37.395
From the mother of a young man who
went missing from the Hotel Leopold.

20:40.075 --> 20:42.435
I will get that footage from the camera.

20:45.275 --> 20:46.275
You're back.

20:47.155 --> 20:48.435
Does that mean we've got a deal?

20:48.755 --> 20:51.475
We established that you were
not lying about the hotel.

20:52.435 --> 20:53.955
We assume

20:55.155 --> 20:59.275
that they were taken from
Nysa, to Szczecin, to a ship.

21:00.075 --> 21:03.515
Sorry, I... I don't see a
deal on the table, do you?

21:04.195 --> 21:05.595
What is your role in this?

21:06.115 --> 21:07.395
What's in it for me?

21:08.555 --> 21:10.435
I need something for me,

21:10.715 --> 21:13.875
and it's gotta be good, Mr. Prosecutor.

21:14.355 --> 21:18.435
Come on, Alex Robek is the man.

21:18.755 --> 21:20.155
He's worth a lot.

21:20.395 --> 21:23.315
Only if you can connect
him directly to this case.

21:23.595 --> 21:26.035
Listen, I'm not gonna waste your time.

21:26.795 --> 21:28.075
I'm a fan.

21:28.555 --> 21:31.595
If you don't get satisfied with
what I give you, I'm screwed, right?

21:31.875 --> 21:33.075
Yeah, you are right.

21:33.235 --> 21:34.235
Genovese?

21:35.235 --> 21:38.195
Yeah. It's all on spec. If the
information doesn't pan out,

21:38.395 --> 21:39.755
- he gets nothing.
- Good.

21:39.955 --> 21:42.195
What the hell does he have? I mean, what...

21:42.795 --> 21:46.075
He's betting everything now
on whatever he's got on Robak.

21:47.435 --> 21:49.235
He must be damn sure it's gonna fly.

21:50.715 --> 21:51.715
Well?

21:55.195 --> 21:57.275
If we can find out what he has on Robak

21:57.515 --> 21:59.675
and deliver it ourselves,
we won't need him, do we?

22:00.955 --> 22:03.795
I would be so happy to never
have to speak with him again.

22:04.155 --> 22:05.635
Let's make him tell us what it is.

22:05.955 --> 22:07.235
Good cop, bad cop?

22:08.275 --> 22:09.675
Bad cop, worse cop.

22:12.035 --> 22:14.995
This was the day after Andreas
was picked up at the train station.

22:18.275 --> 22:19.275
So they were shagging?

22:19.515 --> 22:21.115
And I ran a full work up on Lech.

22:22.115 --> 22:24.715
He recently went to Greece, a
round trip ticket to Thessaloniki.

22:25.195 --> 22:26.955
So Lech is the recruiter?

22:27.755 --> 22:30.835
And shagging's part of the ploy? Dirtbag.

22:31.435 --> 22:32.475
Well, whatever he is,

22:33.035 --> 22:34.915
we need to tell Eva what
she's in the middle of.

22:36.715 --> 22:38.715
Dorn goes to all this trouble...

22:38.995 --> 22:43.635
legal document, sub-clauses
and all, signed and dated.

22:46.755 --> 22:49.595
But I don't actually think that
you have anything to give him.

22:49.955 --> 22:52.835
- You think I'm bluffing?
- Robak's a gold medal,

22:53.275 --> 22:57.035
and he always, always stays out of reach.

22:57.355 --> 23:00.315
So he's not gonna give something
compromising to someone like you.

23:00.515 --> 23:01.555
A garden variety scumbag?

23:01.755 --> 23:03.475
I think you hurt his
feelings with that one.

23:03.595 --> 23:04.715
Shot and a goal.

23:04.875 --> 23:06.875
You know, maybe I won over Robak's trust.

23:07.035 --> 23:09.835
Trust, yeah, that's the first
thing I think of when I see you.

23:10.355 --> 23:12.955
What did you do? Did you trick
him? Did... did you con him?

23:13.115 --> 23:16.315
Photographs, video, something you
could do secretly, a hidden camera?

23:16.875 --> 23:18.795
It must be good. It's
got to be really good.

23:18.995 --> 23:21.211
All of your properties all
over the world have been seized,

23:21.235 --> 23:23.235
and... and you have nothing with you.

23:23.595 --> 23:25.475
No, I must have hid it real good.

23:25.635 --> 23:27.675
How could you be so sure
that it won't be found,

23:27.835 --> 23:29.715
whatever this thing is that you have?

23:29.875 --> 23:32.755
Here's the thing, Amanda, Carl.

23:33.275 --> 23:34.475
You thought you had me.

23:34.995 --> 23:37.011
You brought me all this way
to The Hague, for Godsake.

23:37.035 --> 23:39.475
I mean, you think this
intimidates me? Impresses me?

23:39.675 --> 23:42.715
This building is full of a
bunch of underpaid shitheads

23:42.875 --> 23:46.155
who all wish they could
have stones like me.

23:46.715 --> 23:48.971
They could look at the world
by the short hairs and take it,

23:48.995 --> 23:52.075
take it, take it. But
they don't. You know why?

23:53.755 --> 23:57.115
I'd be running this place within six
months if I wasn't going home first.

23:57.355 --> 23:59.915
- You think you're going home?
- I'm definitely going home.

24:00.035 --> 24:01.555
Home, home, home, baby.

24:02.355 --> 24:03.371
You know what you should've done?

24:03.395 --> 24:05.755
Killed me on that rooftop when
you had a chance. You didn't.

24:06.115 --> 24:08.515
I've thought this all through.
I've planned this whole thing.

24:08.675 --> 24:10.235
But your whole plan goes to hell

24:11.075 --> 24:15.595
if we find those photographs
or videos or whatever

24:16.035 --> 24:18.275
- before you can deal them.
- But you don't got shit.

24:18.715 --> 24:19.875
You're not gonna find shit.

24:20.155 --> 24:23.155
When I turn it over,
you're going to be the fool.

24:25.395 --> 24:26.395
I am?

24:34.195 --> 24:35.635
- Hickman!
- Yeah.

24:40.795 --> 24:43.675
- You can find it?
- Maybe. Let us work it a little.

24:44.235 --> 24:45.235
I'll be here.

24:47.235 --> 24:48.235
You know where to look?

24:49.915 --> 24:52.235
He's hidden it somewhere
to make me look stupid?

24:54.275 --> 24:57.035
Looks like you're going get to see
the shithole I live in after all.

25:05.995 --> 25:06.995
Who are you?

25:07.635 --> 25:08.635
Really?

25:08.715 --> 25:09.795
I'm a police officer.

25:11.435 --> 25:13.155
From The International Criminal Court.

25:14.675 --> 25:15.715
I should have known.

25:17.315 --> 25:20.155
Who the hell stops in Nysa on
their way to somewhere else?

25:20.355 --> 25:21.555
The argument with your father,

25:23.075 --> 25:24.395
was that about Andreas?

25:28.595 --> 25:29.875
You sleeping with him?

25:31.035 --> 25:33.275
You think I used the sex to lure him?

25:33.875 --> 25:38.275
I think you offered Andreas, and
other young men, jobs in this hotel,

25:39.195 --> 25:42.475
knowing they were gonna be sold
into slavery in the Persian Gulf.

25:49.795 --> 25:50.795
Did you take this?

25:55.195 --> 25:56.595
Look at his photograph, Lech.

26:07.955 --> 26:09.275
Did you fall in love?

26:12.115 --> 26:13.675
By then it was too late.

26:14.195 --> 26:17.035
You had to let them take him?

26:18.515 --> 26:19.955
Is that what happened?

26:23.835 --> 26:25.235
Where's Andreas now?

26:25.715 --> 26:26.835
I don't know.

26:28.305 --> 26:29.425
Does your father know?

26:34.145 --> 26:37.785
Does he send you out to
lure men into this trap?

26:44.305 --> 26:46.665
Did you beg your father to let Andreas go?

26:47.505 --> 26:51.825
If you help us, we can still
find Andreas and put a stop to it.

26:52.745 --> 26:54.105
We can still fix this.

26:54.665 --> 26:56.825
If you're scared of
Robak, I can protect you.

26:59.345 --> 27:01.585
All I'm asking you is
to be a little brave now.

27:05.305 --> 27:06.825
We can protect you both.

27:11.145 --> 27:12.265
No, you can't.

27:31.055 --> 27:33.135
When Louis said carnival,

27:34.135 --> 27:36.215
I didn't think he really meant a carnival.

27:36.535 --> 27:38.175
Oh, it's a whole way of life.

27:44.655 --> 27:46.455
This was Genovese's trailer.

27:55.895 --> 27:56.895
Ooh...

27:57.575 --> 27:58.575
See?

28:00.215 --> 28:03.695
They've already searched it top to
bottom. But that's the point, right?

28:03.935 --> 28:06.215
They can look all they
want because it isn't here.

28:06.735 --> 28:08.175
If you're gonna hide something,

28:09.135 --> 28:12.455
you hide it in plain sight, but
in a place that you'd never look.

28:14.055 --> 28:15.255
Like my place.

28:20.095 --> 28:21.095
Someone's in a hurry.

28:22.695 --> 28:24.655
- That's Lech.
- Call Sebastian.

28:24.895 --> 28:26.551
Tell him to get over
here and meet up with Eva.

28:26.575 --> 28:28.015
We'll let them know where we end up.

28:40.711 --> 28:43.671
Check underneath. It might
be taped up somewhere.

28:59.951 --> 29:01.471
Where the hell are we?

29:01.671 --> 29:03.551
Call Sebastian. He can trace your phone.

29:13.631 --> 29:15.671
Arabela? No, I haven't seen her yet.

29:15.911 --> 29:18.471
You're right, yeah, I can do that.
Just make sure you keep it on.

29:20.351 --> 29:22.351
Excuse me? A friend of
mine is staying here?

29:22.511 --> 29:24.351
An Italian girl? Eva.

29:26.071 --> 29:27.831
- 112.
- Thanks.

29:43.471 --> 29:44.791
Let's get a bit closer.

30:04.431 --> 30:05.991
We need to see inside.

30:14.311 --> 30:15.311
Hey...

30:16.471 --> 30:18.671
Hey. Are you okay?

30:19.111 --> 30:22.911
- Yeah. I'm okay.
- You're bleeding. Who did this?

30:24.631 --> 30:27.711
Lech, the manager's son.

30:43.871 --> 30:45.231
It's as close as we're gonna get.

30:53.231 --> 30:55.271
- Shit!
- Can you put your phone on silent?

30:57.911 --> 30:59.991
Sebastien. You find Eva?

31:00.471 --> 31:03.031
Yeah. Lech is working with
them, Tommy. He attacked Eva.

31:03.551 --> 31:05.671
That why I'm standing here
looking at them all now.

31:05.871 --> 31:06.871
What do you mean, them?

31:07.031 --> 31:09.031
Andreas, and they have
four other blokes in a cage.

31:09.751 --> 31:12.551
And they have six or seven big
boys with even bigger machine guns.

31:12.751 --> 31:13.751
What do you need?

31:14.111 --> 31:16.392
A S.W.A.T. team proper hardware,
and about a week to plan.

31:16.791 --> 31:18.751
Right now I'd just settle
for some bloody cavalry.

31:24.871 --> 31:26.911
It... it's clear.

31:27.591 --> 31:29.247
Tear anything apart that might have a place

31:29.271 --> 31:31.007
- where you can hide something in it.
- Tear it up?

31:31.031 --> 31:33.271
Yeah, I don't have a damn
attachment to anything in here.

31:39.471 --> 31:40.471
Come one!

31:42.151 --> 31:43.831
It's got to be somewhere.

31:47.071 --> 31:48.311
Carl, you're destroying it.

31:49.791 --> 31:51.231
You're destroying it, Carl!

31:53.071 --> 31:54.071
Carl!

31:54.591 --> 31:58.111
- Carl! Hey, hey!
- It has to be here!

31:58.431 --> 32:00.591
- It's okay.
- No, it's not okay!

32:01.471 --> 32:03.471
He can't beat us, not again.

32:05.151 --> 32:06.151
He won't.

32:10.031 --> 32:11.631
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine.

32:15.111 --> 32:17.631
- What the hell is he doing?
- I don't know.

32:17.911 --> 32:20.231
It almost looks like he's
having a second thought.

32:36.544 --> 32:37.544
How far away are you?

32:37.704 --> 32:39.624
Well, according to GPS, eight minutes.

32:39.824 --> 32:41.824
They just killed Lech, we
don't have eight minutes.

32:41.984 --> 32:43.424
- Yeah, we're hurrying.
- Okay.

32:43.864 --> 32:45.704
- Lech is dead.
- What?

32:51.307 --> 32:52.467
This is what he wants.

32:53.987 --> 32:56.267
He's... he's playing with us.

32:58.787 --> 33:00.987
I said the same thing at
the beginning of the day.

33:01.547 --> 33:04.067
Well, if you won't listen
to me, listen to you.

33:07.347 --> 33:08.547
I thought it was here.

33:09.467 --> 33:10.507
That day...

33:12.507 --> 33:14.307
when we arrested him the first time,

33:15.387 --> 33:17.307
he spent the whole day in this trailer.

33:18.507 --> 33:19.707
He left me a note.

33:20.827 --> 33:22.467
That's how I found him, with...

33:26.227 --> 33:27.227
With...?

33:29.187 --> 33:30.467
He wasn't alone.

33:31.587 --> 33:32.587
He wasn't?

33:33.867 --> 33:35.227
No, he was with Shari.

33:38.027 --> 33:39.027
Who's Shari?

33:57.547 --> 33:59.307
- Hey...
- I need to talk to you.

34:00.067 --> 34:01.067
Come on in.

34:05.827 --> 34:06.827
What's going on?

34:11.347 --> 34:13.147
Looks like they're
getting ready to move them.

34:13.627 --> 34:14.706
Not if I can help it.

34:15.147 --> 34:17.587
Tommy, there are six
guys with machine guns.

34:17.746 --> 34:18.746
And I have a plan.

34:19.266 --> 34:21.322
Move around a lot, they'll think
there are more of us than there is.

34:21.347 --> 34:23.226
- That's your plan?
- That's as good as it gets.

34:24.947 --> 34:29.147
Why do bravery and stupidity
sometimes look so much alike?

35:09.067 --> 35:10.067
I'm out.

35:13.707 --> 35:14.707
Kill them!

35:17.907 --> 35:19.147
Both sides, move!

35:19.387 --> 35:21.067
- Here they come.
- I'm out, too.

35:21.707 --> 35:22.507
Any ideas?

35:22.707 --> 35:24.027
Can you run faster than a bullet?

35:24.907 --> 35:27.427
- I can't even run faster than you.
- Then I got nothing.

35:30.267 --> 35:31.267
Okay.

35:31.747 --> 35:32.747
Okay.

35:35.747 --> 35:38.347
This is the police. Drop your guns.

35:46.627 --> 35:47.627
Are you okay?

35:48.547 --> 35:51.067
- Yes.
- Yeah, yeah. Andreas is inside.

35:55.187 --> 35:56.827
You don't know whose operation this is.

35:57.547 --> 35:58.667
Oh, I do.

36:01.507 --> 36:02.507
Andreas?

36:05.907 --> 36:06.907
Come with me.

36:09.347 --> 36:10.427
You can sit here.

36:13.587 --> 36:14.467
You're safe now.

36:14.587 --> 36:17.147
It's all over, all right? You're fine.

36:20.427 --> 36:21.867
He tried to save me.

36:23.347 --> 36:24.507
He cared about you.

36:26.227 --> 36:28.427
He tried really hard
that night to save you.

36:29.747 --> 36:31.987
He also fought with his father about that.

36:33.067 --> 36:36.347
- He did?
- Yes. He did.

36:39.947 --> 36:41.107
You mother is here.

36:43.387 --> 36:44.387
Mama?

36:48.507 --> 36:49.507
Mama...

36:55.387 --> 36:56.387
Yeah. Right.

36:57.347 --> 36:58.467
They got the father.

36:58.587 --> 37:00.107
He's locked up at the police barracks.

37:01.347 --> 37:04.027
But without Lech, we have
nothing to link this to Robak.

37:04.147 --> 37:05.347
We've still got Genovese.

37:05.867 --> 37:08.387
That's not going to sit
well with Hickman or Andrews.

37:10.707 --> 37:11.987
I'm sorry to wake you up.

37:12.707 --> 37:13.707
It's okay.

37:14.907 --> 37:18.267
- I can make some coffee.
- No, no, no. No, no thanks, I...

37:20.387 --> 37:21.867
I need your help with something.

37:22.987 --> 37:23.987
Anything.

37:26.467 --> 37:28.587
- You can come over here.
- That's okay.

37:29.027 --> 37:33.547
- I'm sorry. I...
- Amanda. Andrews. Hi.

37:33.787 --> 37:36.147
- You are American?
- New York.

37:36.947 --> 37:38.307
Amanda was my partner.

37:40.987 --> 37:41.987
Oh.

37:43.547 --> 37:45.067
Nice to meet you. I'm Shari. I...

37:45.187 --> 37:47.187
Shari works here. She's the...

37:53.387 --> 37:54.507
She works here.

37:59.667 --> 38:00.987
Listen, um...

38:03.627 --> 38:05.267
We've never really talked about...

38:06.067 --> 38:07.827
- About what?
- About that day.

38:09.227 --> 38:11.347
About that day and that
night with Genovese.

38:13.387 --> 38:14.987
Because I don't really remember it.

38:15.147 --> 38:17.107
I know, I know, I know, but...

38:19.787 --> 38:20.787
I need you...

38:23.387 --> 38:24.667
to remember it.

38:26.507 --> 38:27.227
What?

38:27.387 --> 38:29.147
- I would never ask you this...
- Then don't.

38:29.507 --> 38:32.627
- You know, let's... let's go, Carl...
- Genovese is making a deal.

38:33.547 --> 38:35.187
- A deal?
- Yeah.

38:35.307 --> 38:36.947
- Like he might get out?
- No, no... well,

38:37.107 --> 38:39.027
not for a while anyway.
But eventually, yes,

38:39.147 --> 38:42.307
he would, and... and probably
sooner than he should...

38:42.427 --> 38:45.787
Carl, let's go. Come on.

38:51.747 --> 38:52.747
I'm sorry.

38:58.147 --> 38:59.147
I'm sorry.

39:01.947 --> 39:02.947
I...

39:08.787 --> 39:10.707
I had just got off the phone with you...

39:10.987 --> 39:12.387
Okay. Bye.

39:14.067 --> 39:15.067
He came right in...

39:15.467 --> 39:17.067
What do you want?

39:17.187 --> 39:18.507
Like he owned the place.

39:19.587 --> 39:20.947
He said not to scream.

39:22.267 --> 39:23.387
He said...

39:24.907 --> 39:26.547
if I did what he told me,

39:28.667 --> 39:30.147
he wouldn't hurt me.

39:32.867 --> 39:33.867
He lied.

39:38.347 --> 39:39.347
I kind of...

39:41.067 --> 39:43.147
turned myself off after that.

39:46.867 --> 39:49.267
I realized he didn't want to hurt me,

39:50.867 --> 39:52.467
he wanted to hurt you.

39:56.427 --> 39:58.147
I remember thinking if

39:59.547 --> 40:01.267
I stayed strong,

40:02.467 --> 40:03.867
he couldn't do that.

40:05.027 --> 40:08.587
- He could not hurt you through me.
- Stop. Stop...

40:09.387 --> 40:12.027
What? What do you want me to remember?

40:14.667 --> 40:16.827
I think he hid something in my trailer.

40:20.027 --> 40:21.787
And maybe you saw him do it.

40:42.787 --> 40:45.187
He stood here...

40:53.107 --> 40:55.307
Maybe he put it somewhere here.

41:02.587 --> 41:04.227
Oh, where is it?

41:09.787 --> 41:10.907
Oh, yes.

41:26.787 --> 41:27.867
Nice to meet you.

41:34.907 --> 41:36.107
Good bye, Carl.

41:48.307 --> 41:49.307
Thank you.

41:51.707 --> 41:52.707
What?

41:53.187 --> 41:56.147
Oh, Dorn sent you two to
finalize the deal, huh?

41:56.427 --> 41:58.187
That's fairly twisted.
I'm pretty impressed.

41:58.747 --> 42:00.627
Mr. Robak was just arrested.

42:02.307 --> 42:04.467
We won't be needing that deal after all.

42:07.027 --> 42:10.627
Photos, videos, sound recordings.
Robak is implicated all through it.

42:11.467 --> 42:15.187
Are you bluffing me, 'cause
I had a deal with Dorn?

42:15.307 --> 42:16.667
See, but here's the thing.

42:16.867 --> 42:20.587
Dorn doesn't really do
deals with people like you.

42:20.707 --> 42:23.307
- I had a deal.
- 54 dead girls.

42:23.467 --> 42:24.467
You don't get to use them

42:24.547 --> 42:27.107
as a bargaining chip for
your retirement beach.

42:27.547 --> 42:28.707
Okay, doesn't matter.

42:29.307 --> 42:30.987
Doesn't really matter at all.

42:31.267 --> 42:32.787
I'll find another way to get out here.

42:32.827 --> 42:36.827
But in the meantime, you're
gonna find prison rough.

42:37.187 --> 42:39.067
Oh, yeah. Enemies everywhere.

42:39.467 --> 42:42.427
Guys with personal vendettas, and others

42:43.107 --> 42:45.147
who just don't like people like you.

42:46.387 --> 42:47.387
Anyway.

42:53.907 --> 42:54.947
Sure, Hickman.

42:56.107 --> 42:57.667
I had a deal!

42:58.787 --> 42:59.787
How was it?

42:59.867 --> 43:02.347
I thought bringing him in was
the greatest day of my life.

43:02.707 --> 43:04.987
I know, I know. I need
a... I need a better life.

43:08.507 --> 43:09.507
Hey, Dorn.

43:09.907 --> 43:11.787
Hey, buddy, we're going
to be here a while, huh?

43:12.147 --> 43:14.507
I won't even remember you tomorrow.

43:14.667 --> 43:16.387
Oh, yeah? You're gonna come for me.

43:16.987 --> 43:18.667
Robak's not the only guy I know.

43:19.147 --> 43:21.907
I got shit on a lot of people, buddy.

43:22.347 --> 43:23.747
You're gonna need me again one day.

43:23.827 --> 43:26.187
Is that what you want to
be shouting in a cell block?

43:31.427 --> 43:32.867
Enjoy your stay.

43:41.667 --> 43:43.587
Remember how we used
to celebrate a big win?

43:44.587 --> 43:48.467
Bottle of tequila, target
practice in the junk yard.

43:48.587 --> 43:49.587
Yeah.

43:50.867 --> 43:52.867
Now, you don't drink and I don't shoot.

43:53.547 --> 43:55.787
I'm not sure I even know
what a win is anymore.

43:56.627 --> 43:58.227
Maybe we need new traditions.

43:58.787 --> 43:59.787
Or not.

44:01.107 --> 44:03.467
I'm, um... I'm going to go home today.

44:06.067 --> 44:07.227
Soon as I can get a flight.

44:08.467 --> 44:09.867
I was going to tell you about her.

44:10.027 --> 44:12.347
- No, you weren't.
- Yeah. I was.

44:12.467 --> 44:13.467
No.

44:15.187 --> 44:16.907
You weren't going to tell either one of us.

44:18.867 --> 44:20.907
You didn't even know what to call us.

44:22.827 --> 44:24.667
- Amanda...
- Look, I'm...

44:25.547 --> 44:27.747
I'm not your girlfriend, and...

44:28.947 --> 44:30.387
I don't even really care.

44:31.307 --> 44:32.707
That's not why I'm going home.

44:36.867 --> 44:40.147
- She's just someone...
- Don't. Don't do that.

44:41.067 --> 44:42.867
Don't minimize her. It's not fair.

44:44.507 --> 44:46.147
Not after what you... what we...

44:47.587 --> 44:48.947
asked of her this morning.

44:51.147 --> 44:52.347
How we used her.

45:01.787 --> 45:02.787
That's me.

45:05.307 --> 45:08.667
Hey, next time, we
should... we should talk.

45:09.387 --> 45:12.427
You know, I'll call you
in a couple weeks, yeah?

45:13.427 --> 45:14.907
- Yeah, a couple weeks.
- Okay.

45:15.307 --> 45:16.307
Mandy?

45:26.587 --> 45:28.307
How much time do I give her?

45:30.347 --> 45:31.347
You'll know.

45:44.947 --> 45:45.947
Goodbye.
