01:10.604 --> 01:11.737
No.
Here's good.

01:11.739 --> 01:15.207
What if I told you
one day there'd be
a piece of technology

01:15.209 --> 01:19.111

professional basketball?

01:45.539 --> 01:48.941
Well, here's the thing
about your dream...

01:48.943 --> 01:50.042
It's stupid.

01:50.044 --> 01:50.909
You have the money.

01:50.911 --> 01:53.145
Just get your pants
and give it to me.

01:53.147 --> 01:55.981
Barry, your father's pants
are not a bank.

01:55.983 --> 01:58.283
Money comes from hard work,

my autograph,

I'll do the talking.

18:55.535 --> 18:58.503
Why? Did Mom send you here?

18:58.505 --> 19:00.304
Of course she did.

19:00.306 --> 19:05.109
All right. Uh...
When I was your age,

19:05.511 --> 19:09.080
my dad,
he wasn't around much.

19:09.082 --> 19:11.415
I had nobody looking out
for me.

19:11.417 --> 19:14.018
So I had no direction.

19:14.319 --> 19:16.020
Boy, if I hadn't met
your mother,

19:16.022 --> 19:18.689
I don't know
where I'd be today.

19:18.691 --> 19:22.693
And then Pops gave me
a job at the store,

19:22.695 --> 19:25.997
and, uh, suddenly I'm a guy

19:25.999 --> 19:29.233
with a family
and a future.

19:29.235 --> 19:30.601
What I'm trying to say is

19:30.603 --> 19:36.040
for me, selling furniture
was...was a big deal.

19:36.042 --> 19:38.376
But I want more for you.

19:56.696 --> 19:58.529

my dream was stupid.

19:58.531 --> 20:03.167
Yeah, well, you're just
