echo inside my head.

think about is the others.

02:02.690 --> 02:05.125
Each one traveled the same path.

02:06.294 --> 02:08.862
What was their fate?

02:08.929 --> 02:11.465
What awaits me
on the other side?

02:14.202 --> 02:19.240
They have gone to a place
where the light is cursed
and darkness blinds the soul.

02:22.943 --> 02:27.147
This is a place
where even angels
fear to tread.

Forgive me.

05:37.004 --> 05:38.305
SAMMAEL: Freedom

05:40.273 --> 05:42.443
is the potential to
challenge yourself

05:42.510 --> 05:46.447
far beyond the constraints
of traditional rule.

05:49.417 --> 05:51.985
We draw strength
from our passions.

05:53.621 --> 05:57.391
We're driven by desire.

06:01.228 --> 06:07.200
Even hatred can be
a worthy ally when
used against an enemy.

06:07.267 --> 06:13.073
And yet, we are told
to turn our backs
on these things,

06:16.076 --> 06:20.180
the very feelings, emotions,

06:20.247 --> 06:23.984
that make us all human.

you've been listening
to the wrong source.

06:38.532 --> 06:41.134
It would appear so,
now, wouldn't it?

06:42.636 --> 06:46.640
You don't like me
very much, do you,
Baliel?

06:46.707 --> 06:51.278
Strange, because I
hear no complaints
from the others.

06:58.018 --> 07:00.187
Is it something I've done?

07:02.823 --> 07:05.192
More like something you haven't.

07:10.197 --> 07:13.400
Then let me put
your mind to rest.

to bring him here.

07:48.301 --> 07:50.003
I'm not sure
the others
will agree.

07:50.070 --> 07:52.706
Oh, they will.

07:52.773 --> 07:57.310
And as a sign of
my appreciation,
I have a gift for you.

07:59.446 --> 08:03.283
Do you remember
the Arc, Amitiel?

10:03.303 --> 10:05.138
I know you were here.

10:23.757 --> 10:28.896
GABRIEL: Gabriel.
If you are reading this,
then I have failed.

10:28.962 --> 10:34.167
We are far from grace,
further than I could
ever imagine.

10:34.234 --> 10:38.605
You will feel things
that will cloud your judgment.

10:38.672 --> 10:42.242
This enemy within is strong
and unpredictable.

10:42.309 --> 10:45.645
Control these emotions,
or the fight cannot be won.

10:47.981 --> 10:50.217
The others have failed.

10:50.283 --> 10:52.452
Learn from them,
but do not follow.

15:48.881 --> 15:50.250
Not here.

15:52.819 --> 15:55.922
It's very important
that I speak with her.

15:55.989 --> 15:58.725
She may be in danger.

15:58.791 --> 16:02.295
The only danger here
is what you've brought
with you.

16:05.465 --> 16:08.935
Can you at least
just tell me if
she's still alive?

16:12.672 --> 16:14.407
The answer's yes.

16:15.908 --> 16:17.410
Now I've told you all I know.

16:17.477 --> 16:18.945
Then tell me where she is.

16:19.012 --> 16:20.980
I've told you all I know.

16:21.048 --> 16:22.949
Now it's time for you to leave.

16:59.652 --> 17:01.154
Where is she?

17:11.464 --> 17:13.900
This time, no lies.

17:15.502 --> 17:17.337
You can't pull that trigger.

17:18.238 --> 17:20.240
You're not allowed.

17:20.307 --> 17:22.309
And why's that?

17:22.375 --> 17:24.944
Your orders are to
destroy the Fallen

17:25.011 --> 17:27.847
and bring light
back to this place.

17:27.914 --> 17:30.049
You can't kill innocents.

17:30.983 --> 17:32.985
It's against your code.

17:34.421 --> 17:37.324
So get this fucking
thing out of my face.

17:40.993 --> 17:45.532
Firstly,
Uriel is a he,
not a she.

17:45.598 --> 17:51.371
Secondly, there's not
a fucking chance in hell
he's ever coming back.

17:53.206 --> 17:54.941
Where has he gone?

17:55.575 --> 17:57.310
In here,

17:57.377 --> 17:59.612
where no goddamn
voices or feelings

17:59.679 --> 18:02.315
or anything else can get at him.

18:02.382 --> 18:04.284
Why would he do that?

18:04.351 --> 18:06.886
You felt it
the second
you arrived.

18:08.020 --> 18:10.357
It's the burden of being real,

18:11.691 --> 18:12.925
mortal.

18:14.261 --> 18:17.830
They didn't tell us, Gabe,
what it would be like.

18:17.897 --> 18:22.335
They didn't tell us
how fucking hard
it would be.

18:22.402 --> 18:26.206
If you're Uriel,
then why can't
I feel you?

18:26.273 --> 18:28.575
Because I've learned ways to

18:31.578 --> 18:33.413
silence myself.

18:35.615 --> 18:38.117
Then you've turned
your back on the order.

18:38.185 --> 18:39.652
You've betrayed your oath.

18:39.719 --> 18:43.423
Well, I am only
human, after all.

18:43.490 --> 18:45.992
You are an Arc
and a servant
of the light...

18:46.058 --> 18:50.129
Put into human form
to walk amongst the living,
I know.

18:51.964 --> 18:54.867
Have you ever
felt fear, Gabriel?

18:54.934 --> 18:57.069
Because I do.

18:57.136 --> 18:59.506
I feel it all the fucking time.

19:02.442 --> 19:04.177
I hate this place.

19:05.812 --> 19:08.781
I hate myself.

19:08.848 --> 19:13.152
And before I arrived,
I didn't even know
what that feeling was.

19:14.086 --> 19:16.223
You can't succumb to it.

19:16.289 --> 19:20.059
You have felt
the love and contentment
of a pure existence.

19:20.126 --> 19:22.262
That is where you
draw your strength.

19:22.329 --> 19:24.364
And where's that?

19:24.431 --> 19:25.632
Can you see it?

19:26.833 --> 19:30.437
All I see is a dead world,
run by the Fallen.

19:30.503 --> 19:32.705
And you know what?

19:32.772 --> 19:34.941
These people seem
to like it here.

19:36.976 --> 19:39.946
They actually seem to
enjoy this existence.

19:40.012 --> 19:42.215
So, why should I fight it?

19:42.282 --> 19:43.816
Why should I die for them?

19:43.883 --> 19:45.785
Because they don't
know any better.

19:45.852 --> 19:50.156
It is up to us
to show them that
there is another way.

19:50.223 --> 19:52.392
That it is worth fighting for.

19:52.459 --> 19:56.563
I give you two weeks,

19:56.629 --> 19:58.865
then we'll see what you say.

20:00.533 --> 20:04.404
Now, how about you
get the fuck out
of my face,

20:04.471 --> 20:09.576
because, whilst you
may be bound by rules,
I am not.

20:11.678 --> 20:15.081
You know the other great
thing they forget to tell
you on the way down?

20:15.147 --> 20:21.321
If you die here as
an Arc or a Fallen,
then you're dead forever.

20:21.388 --> 20:25.091
Even the soul dies.
And I ain't risking that.

20:27.360 --> 20:29.161
Neither should you.

20:34.334 --> 20:37.637
This place
is surrounded
by darkness.

20:37.704 --> 20:41.274
The light has
no way of knowing
what goes on down here.

20:42.375 --> 20:44.243
You can't blame them.

20:58.625 --> 21:00.793
There's one thing I forgot.

21:06.866 --> 21:09.469
I'm sorry, Uriel.
I had to do this.

21:11.137 --> 21:13.072
I need you to show yourself.

21:13.139 --> 21:14.674
Heal this wound.

21:14.741 --> 21:16.108
(GURGLING) Fuck you.

21:17.944 --> 21:20.313
Please, Uriel.
Heal this wound.

21:20.380 --> 21:21.848
(SNIGGERING)

21:21.914 --> 21:24.717
You can't let this body die.

21:24.784 --> 21:28.488
You swore an oath.
Now, do it!

21:37.664 --> 21:40.232
(SCREAMING)

22:10.630 --> 22:11.831
Uriel?

22:18.905 --> 22:20.573
Watch the door.

22:22.609 --> 22:25.211
They may be coming.

22:40.126 --> 22:43.763
Pumps like blood
through the veins
of this entire city.

22:44.597 --> 22:46.633
You must be very proud.

22:47.434 --> 22:50.002
If only we could sleep.

22:50.069 --> 22:52.505
You be here about the obeah.

22:52.572 --> 22:55.742
I be thinking Molloch is dead.

22:55.808 --> 22:58.911
It seems they've sent another.

22:58.978 --> 23:02.181
The presence we heard
earlier belonged to
the Arc, Gabriel.

23:02.248 --> 23:05.552
Thee be knowing all
about these things.

23:05.618 --> 23:11.658
With Michael gone,
all their hopes will now
lay with our new friend.

23:11.724 --> 23:16.529
Unfortunately for them,
Michael was always
the stronger of the two.

23:16.596 --> 23:19.365
Well, we all know
what happened to him.

23:19.432 --> 23:24.604
I still sense
the new angel spirit
is strong in this place.

23:24.671 --> 23:27.607
Which is why we will wait.

23:27.674 --> 23:32.211
Let him fall prey
to the good nature
of this city.

23:32.278 --> 23:34.781
And if, in time,
he still has the
will for a battle,

23:34.847 --> 23:38.017
then that's exactly
what we will give him.

23:38.084 --> 23:39.586
Fuck waiting!

23:40.687 --> 23:42.922
The city is ours.

23:42.989 --> 23:45.291
We kill this Arc and go home!

23:46.092 --> 23:47.894
Patience, Ahriman.

23:49.295 --> 23:51.864
Try to think of it as a game.

23:51.931 --> 23:55.067
They move, we move.

23:55.134 --> 23:57.904
Until all the pieces
fall into place.

23:57.970 --> 24:00.940
I don't play fucking games.

24:01.007 --> 24:05.077
You have to trust that
this is the safest
option for all of us.

24:06.579 --> 24:09.115
This is safe.

24:10.449 --> 24:14.754
And this is safe.

24:14.821 --> 24:16.856
SAMMAEL: Hmm.

24:16.923 --> 24:22.128
Well, you know what would
be the safest thing for
you to do right now?

24:22.194 --> 24:24.296
It would be to sit down

24:25.832 --> 24:27.800
and shut the fuck up.

24:30.970 --> 24:32.404
(CHUCKLES)

24:35.141 --> 24:38.978
You be in a funny
mood tonight, boss.

24:39.045 --> 24:41.881
I just look forward
to this being over.

24:42.815 --> 24:44.517
No more conflict.

24:55.795 --> 24:57.296
Pass me one of those.

24:57.363 --> 24:58.898
You sure you want one?

24:58.965 --> 25:02.869
Just because
I'm a fucking angel
doesn't mean I can't smoke.

25:06.706 --> 25:09.742
When I was back
in the city,
you spoke to me.

25:12.579 --> 25:14.747
How did you know I was there?

25:14.814 --> 25:17.483
The same way you
knew I was here.

25:17.550 --> 25:20.987
It's your connection
to the source.

25:21.053 --> 25:24.490
You drew power
from the light
in order to listen.

25:24.557 --> 25:27.660
Problem is, that also
exposes your presence.

25:27.727 --> 25:30.663
And you know a way to hide it.

25:30.730 --> 25:34.667
The Fallen can only
sense us if we're
in close proximity,

25:34.734 --> 25:37.670
that's why I live
so far out here.

25:37.737 --> 25:41.207
If you go using your powers,
drawing from the source,

25:41.273 --> 25:43.943
you're gonna be
like a beacon for them.

25:44.010 --> 25:48.781
And chances are the whole
fucking lot will come down
on you at once.

25:48.848 --> 25:51.083
So you have to conceal
your true self,

25:51.150 --> 25:53.352
far enough so they
can't see you,

25:53.419 --> 25:56.155
but not so far as
you can't come back.

25:56.222 --> 25:58.524
Is that what happened to you?

26:00.593 --> 26:02.094
Not exactly.

26:03.630 --> 26:05.564
But it did contribute.

26:10.703 --> 26:13.039
I want you to close your eyes.

26:18.477 --> 26:21.848
Now, open again.

26:21.914 --> 26:25.351
Right now, you're an angel
inside of a human form.

26:25.417 --> 26:29.521
What we're trying to
do is hide that fact.

26:29.588 --> 26:33.459
So, to everyone out there,
you're completely human.

26:34.961 --> 26:38.330
I want you to search inside,
focus on your spiritual self,

26:38.397 --> 26:40.800
connect and feel it as a whole.

26:43.302 --> 26:46.438
Now, close your eyes.

26:55.982 --> 26:57.483
There you go.

27:01.553 --> 27:02.621
WOMAN: Yeah?

27:02.689 --> 27:03.956
Because it's like,
I get them in,

27:04.023 --> 27:05.892
it's up to you to keep them in.

27:05.958 --> 27:09.028
I say, take pride in
every part of your life.

27:15.001 --> 27:16.836
Hey, Jadey, what's the matter?

27:16.903 --> 27:19.205
You don't say good-bye no more.

27:19.271 --> 27:22.274
Well, how about
smoking my pole,
sweetheart?

27:22.341 --> 27:24.043
(GIRLS LAUGHING)

27:24.110 --> 27:25.812

Fucking deaf bitch.

27:46.733 --> 27:48.868
It's a strange sensation.

27:49.535 --> 27:51.904
I feel slow,

27:53.505 --> 27:54.974
more heavy.

27:58.177 --> 28:02.381
In this form you'll
still be able to listen,
but that's about it.

28:04.917 --> 28:08.254
If we can hide ourselves,
can the Fallen do the same?

28:08.320 --> 28:09.521
Yeah.

28:16.729 --> 28:18.998
What happened to the others?

28:23.602 --> 28:27.106
Remiel was killed
before I arrived.

28:27.173 --> 28:29.776
Besides Amitiel,
it's hard to know.

28:32.044 --> 28:34.413
I've heard nothing of Michael.

28:37.216 --> 28:41.553
I think Raphael is still
around, but he's in hiding
somewhere on the East Side.

28:41.620 --> 28:43.489
What happened to Amitiel?

28:43.555 --> 28:46.458
She lost her wings.
Became mortal.

28:47.726 --> 28:49.428
Sammael is here.

28:50.897 --> 28:52.731
He leads the Fallen.

28:54.433 --> 28:58.771
She went after him
but he was too strong.

28:58.838 --> 29:01.340
Instead of killing her,
he gave her a choice.

29:01.407 --> 29:04.076
Fall from grace
or eternal death.

29:04.143 --> 29:07.679
So she fell,
and now he owns her.

29:10.582 --> 29:12.284
Why would he spare one of us?

29:12.351 --> 29:14.686
He wanted her body.

29:14.753 --> 29:16.823
Sammael used her till
he was tired of her,

29:16.889 --> 29:19.291
then forced her
to work as a hooker.

29:23.195 --> 29:25.564
I know what
you're thinking,
and you shouldn't.

29:26.632 --> 29:28.835
Essentially, Amitiel's dead.

29:30.369 --> 29:32.538
She calls herself Jade now.

29:35.007 --> 29:36.876
Where does she work?

29:39.311 --> 29:41.547
No way, Gabe.
She's not your concern,
not anymore.

29:41.613 --> 29:43.816
Uriel, just tell me.

29:43.883 --> 29:45.918
There's no
turning back for her.
It's a waste of your time.

29:45.985 --> 29:47.820
Don't question
my resolve, Uriel.

29:48.787 --> 29:50.289
Where is she?

29:54.360 --> 29:57.296
I ran into her at a place
called the Funhouse.

29:57.363 --> 30:01.000
It's in the hub of the city,
near the furnaces.

30:03.169 --> 30:04.871
Asmodeus runs it.

30:05.872 --> 30:07.473
I can't let this happen to her.

30:07.539 --> 30:09.041
Who? Amitiel?

30:09.108 --> 30:12.444
She doesn't even
fucking exist anymore!

30:12.511 --> 30:16.182
Even in the state
you were in,
you still helped me.

30:17.383 --> 30:20.419
I have to try.

30:20.486 --> 30:24.323
I thank you for your words
and I promise
I'll return soon.

30:26.926 --> 30:30.162
Gabe, you're chasing a ghost.

30:30.229 --> 30:33.299
Remember what you
were sent here to do.
It's not about us!

30:36.102 --> 30:38.871
You haven't even...

30:38.938 --> 30:41.673
Well, at least remember to eat!

30:41.740 --> 30:43.175
You'll get hungry.

30:43.242 --> 30:44.944
And if you don't eat,
you'll die!

30:54.386 --> 30:55.955
Same old Gabe.

31:45.604 --> 31:48.040
JAKES: There's nothing wrong
with looking nice, man.

31:48.107 --> 31:50.676
I mean, it's a fucking
service industry.

31:50.742 --> 31:53.245
These people come here
just to fuck, right?

31:53.312 --> 31:55.081
It doesn't matter.

31:55.147 --> 31:57.583
It's all in
the presentation,
right?

31:57.649 --> 32:01.453
Hi! How are you, sir?
Enjoy your stay.

32:01.520 --> 32:05.724
See? Treat them nice.
They tell their friends.

32:05.791 --> 32:08.494
It's fucking like
talking to a car park.
You got a light?

32:10.196 --> 32:12.531
(DANCE MUSIC PLAYING)

32:21.373 --> 32:22.808
Hi.

32:22.874 --> 32:24.876
I'm looking for
a girl named Jade.

32:24.943 --> 32:26.912
She's out on a private call.

32:26.979 --> 32:28.214
But I can get one
of our other girls to...

32:28.280 --> 32:29.815
Can you tell me where she is?

32:29.881 --> 32:31.383
I just said she's
out on a private...

32:31.450 --> 32:33.419
Yeah, I know,
I heard that,
but it's important.

32:33.485 --> 32:36.522
Bitches, they come,

32:38.824 --> 32:40.292
they go.

32:40.359 --> 32:41.360
(SIGHING)

32:42.961 --> 32:44.363
Room eight?

32:57.376 --> 32:59.311
You been here before?

33:02.048 --> 33:03.182
No.

33:17.363 --> 33:20.532
Nice to see you've
dressed up for
the occasion.

33:24.036 --> 33:25.437
Here you go.

33:27.239 --> 33:29.608
Give this gentleman half-price.

33:32.778 --> 33:35.914
I've got a feeling
we'll be seeing him again.

33:43.021 --> 33:45.757
So, do you want
to see another girl?

33:48.060 --> 33:50.129
Actually, I'll come back.

33:52.598 --> 33:54.032
Thank you.

33:57.236 --> 33:59.705
CANDY: Oh, Jade, remember
you're booked tonight.

33:59.771 --> 34:02.808
Scampi's Motel, room 36.

34:02.874 --> 34:04.876
It's two guys, one at a time.

34:04.943 --> 34:06.112
You got that?

34:19.991 --> 34:21.592
That was quick.

34:26.431 --> 34:28.534
What's the quickest way
to Scampi's Motel?

34:30.569 --> 34:31.803
Uh.

34:31.870 --> 34:35.940
About four blocks down,
turn right,
across the street.

34:37.943 --> 34:40.846
You're welcome. Come again.
Nice to have you here.

34:40.911 --> 34:43.649
What a friendly fellow. Fuck.

35:08.940 --> 35:10.041
Hi.

35:21.153 --> 35:23.455
So, this is the lovely Jade.

35:25.191 --> 35:26.692
In the flesh.

35:35.867 --> 35:39.070
So, how do you guys
want to do this?

35:47.579 --> 35:49.515
Take off your clothes.

36:07.132 --> 36:10.869
Candy told you guys
about the rule
of one at a time, yeah?

36:10.936 --> 36:13.071
Yeah.

36:13.138 --> 36:16.107
But unfortunately,
that's not what we want.

36:18.944 --> 36:20.145
Really?

36:21.480 --> 36:24.049
Then maybe you've got
the wrong girl.

36:29.721 --> 36:31.423
I don't think so.

36:32.658 --> 36:34.726
Your name's Jade, right?

36:39.498 --> 36:40.999
Well, is it?

36:42.501 --> 36:44.536
Yeah.

36:44.603 --> 36:49.174
You do work at the Funhouse,
which means you are a whore?

36:51.443 --> 36:53.645
You do fuck for money, yeah?

36:56.181 --> 37:00.118
Then that means your
real name is Amitiel,

37:01.287 --> 37:03.589
and you used to be an angel.

37:04.756 --> 37:06.625
Oh, sorry.

37:06.692 --> 37:09.895
Arc, as you like
to call yourselves.

37:10.996 --> 37:12.998
So, you see, Jade,

37:13.064 --> 37:16.768
we are both going
to enjoy the pleasure
of your divine company,

37:16.835 --> 37:19.438
whether you like it or not.

37:19.505 --> 37:23.141
I prefer it rough,
so I hope you do, too.

37:28.614 --> 37:29.981

37:45.564 --> 37:48.266
This meat's a little tough.

37:48.334 --> 37:50.369
What do you say, Marcus?

37:51.537 --> 37:53.372
(GASPING)

37:55.006 --> 37:56.342

38:06.318 --> 38:10.021
See what happens
when you make all
this fucking noise?

38:10.088 --> 38:11.490
Who is it?

38:11.557 --> 38:13.158
(KNOCKING)

38:13.224 --> 38:16.061
You got a tongue in
your fucking head?

(GROANING)

39:11.016 --> 39:12.451
(THUNDER RUMBLING)

40:11.943 --> 40:13.679
Where am I?

40:13.745 --> 40:15.447
In a safe place here.

40:18.016 --> 40:20.686
You've been
unconscious
for a while.

40:22.988 --> 40:25.591
I've got to get back to work.

40:25.657 --> 40:26.792
No.

40:28.494 --> 40:30.662
You have to stay and rest.

40:36.001 --> 40:39.104
I've spoken to Asmodeus.

40:39.170 --> 40:42.841
He says he wants
you to stay here
until you get better.

40:43.909 --> 40:45.977
You're so full of shit.

40:50.148 --> 40:52.551
What did you say your name was?

40:55.020 --> 40:56.321
Gabriel.

40:59.324 --> 41:00.759
Did we fuck?

41:02.694 --> 41:03.829
No.

41:05.363 --> 41:07.198
Were we supposed to?

41:08.700 --> 41:09.835
No.

41:14.072 --> 41:15.240
Good.

41:19.945 --> 41:22.413
I sense the darkness inside you.

41:24.215 --> 41:28.554
It clouds your soul
but I know it
takes away your pain.

41:35.961 --> 41:38.530
I'm not supposed to interfere.

41:38.597 --> 41:40.799
You have a right to choose,

41:42.568 --> 41:44.903
but I'm not sure you ever did.

41:48.807 --> 41:50.576
So, if I am wrong,

41:53.411 --> 41:55.213
please forgive me.

42:07.458 --> 42:09.060
This will hurt

42:10.896 --> 42:12.063
a lot.

42:13.632 --> 42:16.101
(JADE GROANING)

42:39.224 --> 42:41.392
(PANTING)

42:52.871 --> 42:56.141
You had no right to do that!

42:56.207 --> 42:58.877
I won't believe you
are what they say.

42:58.944 --> 43:01.312
Did they tell you
I lost my wings?

43:01.379 --> 43:03.114
Did they tell you I'm a smackie?

43:03.181 --> 43:04.916
That I fuck for money?

43:04.983 --> 43:07.085
They said you had
the courage
to fight Sammael.

43:07.152 --> 43:08.319
You fought well but you lost.

43:08.386 --> 43:10.255
There is no disgrace in that.

43:10.321 --> 43:12.423
If only they
could see me
now, huh?

43:12.490 --> 43:13.992
Where the fuck are my clothes?

43:15.627 --> 43:17.428
I won't let anything
else happen to you.

43:17.495 --> 43:20.565
You don't even know
Sammael's power!

43:20.632 --> 43:23.835
He's grown stronger
than all of us combined.

43:23.902 --> 43:25.737
If Michael couldn't defeat him,

43:25.804 --> 43:27.305
what chance do you have?

43:29.074 --> 43:31.843
I have seen and done
things here that...

43:31.910 --> 43:34.379
I can't even believe
this place exists.

43:35.647 --> 43:38.817
I mean, I knew it was
going to be hard but...

43:38.884 --> 43:40.952
And I can't ever go back.

43:41.019 --> 43:44.222
I can never go back.
I will never see
the light again.

43:44.289 --> 43:46.457
You're wrong.

43:46.524 --> 43:49.828
Just because you're not
an Arc, it doesn't mean
you can't return as a soul.

43:49.895 --> 43:51.362
What does that mean?

43:51.429 --> 43:53.231
What? I wait my
days out here?

43:53.298 --> 43:56.301
I grow old, I fucking die?

43:56.367 --> 43:59.971
I can't even kill
myself because it's
against the rules.

44:00.038 --> 44:02.507
I could be here for
another 50 years, Gabe!

44:02.573 --> 44:06.812
That is nothing
compared to an
eternity of darkness.

44:06.878 --> 44:08.546
How long you been here for?

44:08.613 --> 44:11.216
A few days? A week?

44:11.282 --> 44:13.284
I've been here for
two and a half years,

44:13.351 --> 44:15.721
and that feels
longer than eternity.

44:17.823 --> 44:20.692
I feel like they've
just betrayed us,

44:20.759 --> 44:22.928
they've just left us
here to die.

44:22.994 --> 44:25.063
And once you've
been killed,
that is it.

44:25.897 --> 44:28.399
What then?

44:28.466 --> 44:32.303
You will see the light return
before this week is through.

44:35.173 --> 44:38.143
I'm sure Michael said
the exact same thing.

44:43.248 --> 44:44.983
SAMMAEL: You are troubled.

44:46.451 --> 44:49.420
Why does this not surprise me?

44:49.487 --> 44:51.556
Did you feel him just now?

44:51.622 --> 44:54.259
Yes, he lives in the North.

44:55.193 --> 44:57.062
Somewhere in the slums.

44:57.128 --> 44:59.597
Then tell me why we wait.

44:59.664 --> 45:02.100
You lust for his blood.

45:02.167 --> 45:05.370
So, right now,
he still possesses
much strength.

45:05.436 --> 45:11.542
And I can't possibly
risk losing anyone else
from our little family.

45:11.609 --> 45:14.412
You could take him on your own.

45:14.479 --> 45:16.948
I grow weary of your hesitation.

45:18.049 --> 45:20.786
There are others just like him,

45:21.787 --> 45:23.254
but they are broken,

45:25.023 --> 45:26.858
some beyond repair.

45:28.526 --> 45:32.463
The only resolve will be
once they are all dead.

45:32.530 --> 45:35.500
I need him to bring them out,

45:35.566 --> 45:40.505
show them they can shine
just bright enough
for all of us to see.

45:43.141 --> 45:44.910
Then I am mistaken.

45:45.977 --> 45:47.512
Yes, you are.

46:07.432 --> 46:14.439
And, if you ever
question such
things again,

46:14.505 --> 46:19.010
I will rip your tongue
out and paint my name
in blood across your back.

46:28.253 --> 46:30.788
I see you have
some friends here.

46:32.057 --> 46:34.425
Would you mind introducing me?

46:59.650 --> 47:01.586
I missed you.

47:01.652 --> 47:03.554
You've missed Amitiel, not me.

47:05.823 --> 47:07.558
They're not
as different
as you think.

47:09.494 --> 47:12.163
You don't get it, do you?

47:12.230 --> 47:15.566
Everything here
works against us, Gabe.

47:15.633 --> 47:18.803
We fall prey to the things
we never even knew.

47:20.071 --> 47:23.108
Fear, hate,

47:23.174 --> 47:27.979
the very things
that make him,
make all of them, stronger.

47:31.950 --> 47:35.120
Do we not have
the compassion
to overcome this?

47:37.255 --> 47:40.691
I honestly don't think so.

47:40.758 --> 47:43.929
The city itself
is the best defense
they have.

47:51.169 --> 47:52.938
What are you thinking about?

47:56.107 --> 47:57.842
I think I'm hungry.

48:08.319 --> 48:09.921
What is this place?

48:09.988 --> 48:12.723
Soup kitchen.
They help the homeless.

48:17.362 --> 48:19.797
We can't eat here.

48:19.864 --> 48:22.333
These people need
food more than us.

48:22.400 --> 48:27.038
In case you hadn't noticed,
we're kind of desperate
ourselves. Come on.

48:30.942 --> 48:32.310
Want bread?

48:32.377 --> 48:33.411
Yeah.

48:37.082 --> 48:38.683
Here you go.

48:40.118 --> 48:41.419
Thanks.

49:03.474 --> 49:05.310
Do you know the guy
who served us?

49:07.412 --> 49:09.314
Does he seem familiar?

over confrontation.

and I had to learn.

56:44.869 --> 56:46.403

56:49.540 --> 56:51.408
Sammael has found
a way of harnessing

the collective energies
from each of the Fallen.

56:54.545 --> 56:57.948
He's become stronger, faster.

his presence is
now always cloaked,

to Michael?

Though none of us
actually saw him,

59:30.367 --> 59:33.203
we felt him the night
that he arrived,

59:33.270 --> 59:35.673
a force of consummate strength.

59:37.708 --> 59:40.344

his signal grew weaker

he fought Sammael,

meant to you, Gabe.

Gabe, listen.

01:15:55.418 --> 01:15:56.920
No!

01:15:56.986 --> 01:15:58.688

all big and macho,

fucking gun around.

How does that make
you feel? Powerful?

01:18:57.566 --> 01:19:00.669
Actually, don't answer that.

01:19:01.670 --> 01:19:03.840
I can see it in your eyes.

01:19:12.648 --> 01:19:14.984
Are you angry with me, Gabriel?

01:19:17.520 --> 01:19:20.156
Have I done something
to offend you?

01:19:22.391 --> 01:19:25.929
I hope this isn't
about your friends,
is it?

01:19:25.995 --> 01:19:29.065
Because, I mean,
if you didn't
want them dead,

01:19:30.199 --> 01:19:32.101
why did you lead us to them?

01:19:40.209 --> 01:19:42.145
So, it's going to
be like that, is it?

01:19:43.179 --> 01:19:44.480
Such a shame.

don't tell them
what went on

is set myself free.

have understood!
