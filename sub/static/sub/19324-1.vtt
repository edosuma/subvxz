<i>Lucy, my dear.</i>

01:24.485 --> 01:30.155
<i>If you need anything, call me
and I'll be here in an instant.</i>

01:39.966 --> 01:44.470
Here, that should take
care of the pregnancy.

02:10.562 --> 02:16.401
Hi, I'm rosemund,
but everybody calls me rosey.

02:18.004 --> 02:21.707
- You're an artist.
- I just like to draw.

02:23.109 --> 02:26.078
- Can I see what you're doing?
- I'm not any good.

02:26.080 --> 02:30.582
Aw, come on!
I won't make fun, I promise.

02:40.026 --> 02:42.528
Are you like really
upset or something?

02:44.999 --> 02:47.199
It's cool though, I like it.

02:48.902 --> 02:50.736
A little giraffe.

02:50.738 --> 02:54.673
- Gosh, is that your room?
- <i>Mm-hmm.</i>

02:54.675 --> 02:57.276
- It's awesome.
- Thanks.

03:00.547 --> 03:03.048
Oh, my god.

03:04.050 --> 03:07.619
This is the coolest
house I have ever seen.

03:07.621 --> 03:09.288
It's my home.

03:09.290 --> 03:12.024
Wow.

03:17.764 --> 03:19.031
But it's yours.

03:19.033 --> 03:21.667
Which means i
can give it to you.

03:21.669 --> 03:25.737
Hey, I don't, you
didn't tell me your name.

03:25.739 --> 03:28.607
I'm Lucy.

03:28.609 --> 03:31.910
Lucy, cool.

04:35.109 --> 04:37.609
I cannot believe I let you
and David talk me into this.

04:37.611 --> 04:41.380
Oh, you've come a long way since the
Agnes croft school for girls, huh?

04:41.382 --> 04:44.149
Okay, here we go.

04:44.151 --> 04:46.485
Ladies and gentlemen,
it is my great pleasure

04:46.487 --> 04:49.321
to introduce the guest
of honor for this evening,

04:49.323 --> 04:51.556
Ms. Lucy moon.

04:54.828 --> 04:57.262
It's nights like
these that really show

04:57.264 --> 04:59.298
that the Gulf coast is
becoming a cultural center now.

04:59.300 --> 05:02.067
And we want to, really on behalf
of all of us, welcome you,

05:02.069 --> 05:06.305
and world class artist Lucy
moon, and your son David moon.

05:06.307 --> 05:08.607
Well, thank you.
Very kind words.

05:08.609 --> 05:10.442
It's good to be home.

05:10.444 --> 05:11.910
I wanted to ask you.

05:11.912 --> 05:14.846
Do you think that your son's
live streaming project is

05:14.848 --> 05:16.815
kind of taking away
from the artists,

05:16.817 --> 05:18.850
and the work they're doing here?

05:31.564 --> 05:33.165
Well, David moon has
just joined the show,

05:33.167 --> 05:35.000
and it looks like it's
going to be some night.

05:35.002 --> 05:36.868
You know judging by the
crowd's reaction tonight,

05:36.870 --> 05:38.036
I think you're right.

05:54.587 --> 05:56.388
Hey, mom.

05:56.390 --> 05:58.523
For god's sake, David.

05:59.826 --> 06:02.294
What, why can't you understand
that I have my own talents?

06:02.296 --> 06:05.964
Huh? Look, why can't
you be proud of me?

06:05.966 --> 06:08.266
I don't understand
why you can't manage

06:08.268 --> 06:12.170
to conduct yourself in a manner
of which I can be proud.

06:12.172 --> 06:14.306
Oh, I see.

06:14.308 --> 06:16.808
You know, you really should
have just given me up

06:16.810 --> 06:18.377
for adoption when
you had the chance.

06:18.379 --> 06:21.079
'Cause that would've saved you
so much time and energy.

06:21.081 --> 06:23.548
If these people only
knew that you are just

06:23.550 --> 06:25.117
as great of a mother
as you are as an artist.

06:25.119 --> 06:27.252
God, you'd be a smash.

06:27.254 --> 06:30.956
Ah, okay, okay.
David, rein it in.

06:30.958 --> 06:33.658
Rosey, rosey, I am
on top of the world.

06:33.660 --> 06:35.127
Oh, I know you are, honey.

06:35.129 --> 06:37.596
Just try to keep it
together, okay?

06:37.997 --> 06:39.498
Okay.

06:42.468 --> 06:44.002
Move.

06:44.004 --> 06:46.304
<i>I would like to thank
you all for coming out tonight</i>

06:46.306 --> 06:49.007
to give Lucy and
David moon a genuine,

06:49.009 --> 06:51.643
Mississippi Gulf coast welcome.

06:51.645 --> 06:56.481
Um, the gallery will be officially
open in just 10 minutes,

06:56.483 --> 07:00.519
where you can all view, for the
first time ever, "dark exposure".

07:00.521 --> 07:03.655
<i>Alongside David moon's
ground-breaking</i>

07:03.657 --> 07:06.591
<i>multi-media production,
"hidden perspectives"</i>

07:06.593 --> 07:08.593
which will give an
entirely new ambiance

07:08.595 --> 07:11.763
to our delicious
Mississippi coastline.

07:11.765 --> 07:15.233
Thank you all again for coming.
See you inside.

07:23.609 --> 07:26.311
Don't worry about it.
You just enjoy yourself.

07:26.313 --> 07:29.214
Where the hell is David? He's
supposed to be here right now.

07:34.687 --> 07:36.755
Makes me want to
blow something else.

07:36.757 --> 07:39.024
You are so bad.

07:39.892 --> 07:41.326
In a really good way.

07:41.328 --> 07:45.230
I know, that's why
i keep you around.

07:45.232 --> 07:47.966
I'm kidding, it's a joke.

07:47.968 --> 07:51.470
It's a joke, it's a joke.

07:53.573 --> 07:55.474
Could I please
get everyone's attention?

07:55.476 --> 07:59.144
Hi, I just wanted
to thank you all

07:59.146 --> 08:01.580
for being such great
supporters for the gallery.

08:01.582 --> 08:04.449
Um, in just a few minutes
you will get your reward.

08:04.451 --> 08:07.052
And in the meantime please,
feel free to walk around

08:07.054 --> 08:10.055
and enjoy the works of all
our other wonderful artists.

08:10.057 --> 08:11.756
And just remember to smile,

08:11.758 --> 08:15.460
as David says the entire
world will be watchin'.

08:15.462 --> 08:18.530
Okay, thank you all again.

08:20.867 --> 08:23.101
I saw him go upstairs
with that Connie Lee girl.

08:23.103 --> 08:25.837
- What else is new?
- Just go get him.

08:28.675 --> 08:31.676
Son of a bitch, I am not
covering for you anymore.

08:31.678 --> 08:34.913
I'm sorry, any more?

08:34.914 --> 08:38.517
You never did, asshole.

08:38.519 --> 08:40.552
I take care of myself, okay?

08:40.554 --> 08:42.087
I always have, I always will.

08:42.089 --> 08:44.523
So I think I'll be
just fine without you

08:44.525 --> 08:48.226
and mommy dearest
looking out after me.

08:54.267 --> 08:59.304
Why thank you so much for
your mock concern.

09:06.045 --> 09:08.280
Fuck you, Austin.

09:09.916 --> 09:13.618
No, fuck David.

09:27.199 --> 09:29.568
Good evening, uncle Walter.

09:29.570 --> 09:34.406
Good evenin'. Remember what I said,
don't tell anyone that I am here.

09:34.408 --> 09:37.642
Oh, sounds lively.

09:37.644 --> 09:41.713
<i>Welcome everyone to
my fantastic mother,</i>

09:41.715 --> 09:46.785
who's always been so
supportive of me's art show.

09:47.353 --> 09:48.453
<i>Art opening.</i>

09:48.455 --> 09:51.256
She looks absolutely
resplendent.

09:51.258 --> 09:53.091
Here's some of her pieces.

09:53.093 --> 09:56.094
Earlier works, that she did.

09:56.096 --> 09:57.829
That one's particularly hideous.

09:58.765 --> 10:00.966
<i>Ah, we can move past here.</i>

10:00.968 --> 10:02.667
Ah, through here.

10:02.669 --> 10:05.270
Ah, and then we
will come to these.

10:05.272 --> 10:08.139
These are her earlier sketches,
where she...

10:08.141 --> 10:12.911
Well, David seems to have
found his metier...

10:12.913 --> 10:15.213
Vocation.

10:15.215 --> 10:19.084
Thanks, I know
what metier means.

10:19.086 --> 10:24.022
Well, let's hope you can
find something someday.

10:24.024 --> 10:28.760
And this is the biggest
anticipation of the night.

10:28.762 --> 10:33.732
The work that she's been
painting for many, many months.

10:33.734 --> 10:36.167
"Dark exposure".

10:51.218 --> 10:55.020
Mm. Once again, my dear,
you have made a splash.

10:55.022 --> 10:58.323
Aw, and your presence
is the icing on the cake.

10:58.325 --> 10:59.758
And that dress.

10:59.760 --> 11:02.794
Come in girl sizes?

11:02.796 --> 11:05.697
I'm so proud of you.

11:06.298 --> 11:08.066
Thank you, honey.

11:09.168 --> 11:11.736
Not really my scene.

11:12.938 --> 11:15.907
I saw what I came for,
thank you.

11:45.538 --> 11:47.238
Hmm.

12:12.364 --> 12:15.900
Shit, David, come on.

12:27.179 --> 12:28.847
<i>Hello, world.
You've got my number,</i>

12:28.849 --> 12:32.050
<i>which means your allowed
to leave me a voicemail.</i>

13:30.142 --> 13:32.177
- What do we got?
- Go right inside, sir.

13:32.179 --> 13:33.678
- I think they're ready for you.
- Okay, thanks man.

13:33.680 --> 13:35.680
- All right.
- Thanks.

13:39.051 --> 13:40.952
Thank you.

13:48.327 --> 13:51.563
Hey, Eddie,
so what you have so far?

13:51.565 --> 13:53.598
Name's David moon.

13:53.600 --> 13:57.936
Some kind of new media,
YouTube big shot.

13:57.938 --> 14:00.305
- I don't know.
- How old is he?

14:00.307 --> 14:02.674
Kid's not twenty-five.

14:02.676 --> 14:06.277
Shit. Who's that?

14:06.279 --> 14:09.647
Owner of the gallery,
rosemund Wallace.

14:09.649 --> 14:14.018
No priors, no husband,
boyfriend, no girlfriend.

14:14.020 --> 14:16.254
That's always good to know.

14:16.256 --> 14:20.925
Hey, Mike, get a closer look
at this painting, will ya?

14:20.927 --> 14:25.330
And tell me if you don't
think that's a little strange.

14:26.699 --> 14:28.299
Yeah, it is.

14:28.301 --> 14:30.702
Well, fellini would've
been proud, huh?

14:30.704 --> 14:32.470
Who?

14:35.641 --> 14:38.676
Ms. Wallace?
I'm detective Michael mavredes.

14:38.678 --> 14:41.713
Do you mind if I ask you
some questions?

14:42.114 --> 14:43.815
Yeah.

14:49.655 --> 14:52.257
Did you know the young man?

14:53.225 --> 14:55.593
Since he was born.

14:55.595 --> 14:56.995
I'm sorry.

14:58.097 --> 15:00.698
He had his problems,
but he was a good kid

15:00.700 --> 15:03.368
and a great talent.

15:04.370 --> 15:06.237
He...

15:06.239 --> 15:08.640
He didn't deserve this.

15:08.642 --> 15:10.942
Did he ever speak to
you about being unhappy?

15:10.944 --> 15:14.212
Maybe, maybe hurting himself?

15:14.980 --> 15:19.117
David was Lucy moon's son.

15:19.119 --> 15:23.054
We just had this
celebration of a lifetime

15:23.056 --> 15:24.455
to honor their work.

15:24.457 --> 15:29.994
There's, there's no way
David just committed suicide.

15:29.996 --> 15:32.096
Okay.

15:34.700 --> 15:39.037
Oh, how am I gonna tell Lucy?

15:39.039 --> 15:42.407
Yes, Ms. Wallace. In my experience,
I should probably handle that.

15:42.409 --> 15:46.244
No, no, no, no, no, I'll go.

15:50.816 --> 15:52.450
Okay.

16:15.240 --> 16:19.110
Ms. Wallace, are you sure
you want to do this?

16:20.079 --> 16:22.613
She's my best friend.

16:26.118 --> 16:27.618
Okay.

16:29.455 --> 16:32.023
Rosemund, what a nice surprise.

16:32.025 --> 16:33.825
Hi, Lucy.

16:33.827 --> 16:38.296
Um, this is detective mavredes.

16:38.298 --> 16:40.665
- Ms. moon.
- Yes?

16:42.935 --> 16:47.805
Uh, we have something
we need to tell you.

16:49.241 --> 16:51.676
Well, what is it?
Tell me.

16:54.079 --> 16:57.582
Ms. moon, it might be best
if we go inside.

16:57.584 --> 17:02.453
No, tell me now, here.

17:05.656 --> 17:07.925
Ms. moon, I'm so very
sorry to tell you this.

17:07.926 --> 17:11.762
Today we discovered you son's
body in the Wallace gallery.

17:50.436 --> 17:53.471
I don't know
what happened back there.

17:53.473 --> 17:55.440
It's understandable.

17:57.676 --> 18:01.145
How do we find who did this?

18:01.147 --> 18:03.714
That's what I'm going to
try and find out.

18:11.023 --> 18:12.890
Hey, rosey, go home, okay?

18:12.892 --> 18:14.725
I can do this,
you need to get some rest.

18:14.727 --> 18:18.563
I need to keep busy.
Signet ring?

18:18.565 --> 18:20.631
Look at this.

18:26.004 --> 18:28.106
Here, give it to me.
I'll put it up in the office.

18:28.108 --> 18:30.575
Oh, no, you're fine.

18:30.577 --> 18:32.743
I'll give it to
detective mavredes.

18:32.745 --> 18:37.014
Hey, Ms. Wallace.
I got my stuff out back.

18:37.016 --> 18:42.920
Great, go give him a hand.
I'll be right out.

18:43.555 --> 18:44.956
Good to see you.

18:44.958 --> 18:48.059
We're all looking
forward to your show.

18:59.605 --> 19:01.139
Thank you.

19:06.278 --> 19:08.913
These are just wonderful.

19:08.915 --> 19:10.815
Yes, ma'am.

19:10.817 --> 19:13.718
They just wash up
on the shore and I find them.

19:13.720 --> 19:16.320
Maybe you could come with
me sometime, I'll show you.

19:16.322 --> 19:19.524
I would love that.

19:22.060 --> 19:24.028
Thank you.

19:39.211 --> 19:43.814
- They're, uh, so crude.
- Austin!

19:43.816 --> 19:45.249
Well, I mean look at them.

19:45.251 --> 19:48.252
They're just completely
lacking in sophistication.

19:48.254 --> 19:49.954
It's precisely
the lack of sophistication

19:49.956 --> 19:52.156
that makes his
work so appealing.

19:52.158 --> 19:58.429
There's a rawness, a certain
primal quality to them.

19:59.231 --> 20:01.432
You cannot be serious.

20:02.501 --> 20:03.701
You...

20:06.339 --> 20:11.075
You're the only gallery in town that
has the balls to showcase real work.

20:11.077 --> 20:12.577
- Yeah.
- Not this crap.

20:12.579 --> 20:15.079
This...
That's why I work for you.

20:15.081 --> 20:17.248
Not for your fuckin'
15 bucks an hour.

20:17.250 --> 20:20.017
- That's enough, Austin.
- And how do you think I feel?

20:20.019 --> 20:22.353
You don't look at my
photographs for what, ever?

20:22.355 --> 20:25.890
And then this guy comes in off the
street with some driftwood shit

20:25.892 --> 20:27.925
and you just can't
wait to showcase him.

20:27.927 --> 20:29.827
Yeah, thanks.

20:51.516 --> 20:53.351
Fuck!

21:22.080 --> 21:24.315
You are an artist.

21:24.317 --> 21:26.484
You are an artist.

21:26.486 --> 21:28.853
You are an artist.

21:28.855 --> 21:30.588
You are an artist.

21:37.963 --> 21:39.430
<i>See, wood's got to be strong</i>

21:39.432 --> 21:42.633
and have just the
right amount of twist.

21:42.635 --> 21:48.339
So that there's
a head or tail...

21:49.941 --> 21:52.710
Or even a wing.

21:54.913 --> 21:58.049
Now what kind of animal
do you think that is?

22:00.253 --> 22:03.988
Look at the eye.
You got to find the eye.

22:05.490 --> 22:07.892
I'm sorry, i just don't see it.

22:09.194 --> 22:11.362
That's 'cause you ain't
used to seeing the world

22:11.364 --> 22:14.165
that exists between
ours and the next.

22:14.167 --> 22:18.436
It's a place that can
only be seen in here.

22:18.438 --> 22:22.306
And you just ain't been
taught how to look yet.

22:22.308 --> 22:24.442
Now, looka here.

22:24.444 --> 22:28.679
See? There's the body,
right there.

22:28.681 --> 22:32.249
And over here,
coming up out the sea.

22:32.251 --> 22:35.586
- That's his head.
- Yes.

22:35.588 --> 22:37.054
It's a shark!

22:38.157 --> 22:40.925
And he's right there
that whole time.

22:40.927 --> 22:44.528
All you need to do to see it
was to start using this.

22:46.331 --> 22:48.899
Come on, sit down over there.

22:50.836 --> 22:53.170
Oh, this is nice, Mayo.

22:58.577 --> 23:02.947
There's a certain crowd
on the coast.

23:02.949 --> 23:05.216
A men's only set.

23:05.218 --> 23:10.020
Money, connections,
real, real private.

23:10.022 --> 23:14.091
Like to throw quiet gatherings.

23:15.427 --> 23:21.766
Parties with young,
creative guys.

23:25.971 --> 23:29.273
Well, the boy was
with them sometimes.

23:32.010 --> 23:34.745
Wasn't no women at
these parties, ma'am.

23:36.815 --> 23:39.784
Are you trying to say
David was gay?

23:39.786 --> 23:45.623
All I know for sure was that the
boy was with a lot heavy hitters.

23:45.625 --> 23:49.260
One in particular is from
the governor's office.

23:49.262 --> 23:52.296
His name is James Travers.

23:52.298 --> 23:53.764
You go to these parties, Mayo?

23:57.169 --> 23:58.836
No, ma'am.

23:59.971 --> 24:03.040
I'm afraid I wouldn't
be invited.

24:05.477 --> 24:07.778
But I know somebody who would.

24:07.780 --> 24:11.715
I'll take you to meet him
when the time is right.

24:14.453 --> 24:16.253
<i>What's the surprise?</i>

24:16.255 --> 24:17.788
Come here, come here.

24:17.790 --> 24:21.225
I want to show you something.
I want you to just take a look.

24:22.694 --> 24:24.695
These yours?

24:29.301 --> 24:31.602
Nice composition.

24:33.371 --> 24:35.306
I like the lighting in this one.

24:37.142 --> 24:41.946
Okay, listen, listen. I know that I
have a long way to go as an artist.

24:41.948 --> 24:45.216
All right, but I think
that these can be shown.

24:45.218 --> 24:48.085
They're wonderful, really.

24:49.354 --> 24:51.355
<i>So you'll exhibit them?</i>

24:51.357 --> 24:54.758
I'll give it
serious consideration.

24:56.361 --> 24:59.129
Don't knock yourself out
with compliments, rosey.

24:59.131 --> 25:01.065
Austin, I do think
your work is good.

25:01.067 --> 25:05.436
I just don't know if you're
breaking any new ground.

25:05.438 --> 25:08.272
Yes, I am!
I mean, are you blind?

25:08.274 --> 25:10.774
This is unique,
this is original.

25:10.776 --> 25:12.810
That's enough.

25:12.812 --> 25:15.312
Why don't you clean this up
and we'll discuss it later?

25:15.314 --> 25:19.550
Once you've calmed down
and I'm a bit less preoccupied.

25:19.552 --> 25:22.453
<i>- No, really, Austin.</i>
- I'm sorry.

25:30.762 --> 25:33.531
<i>You need to free your mind
of all this turmoil.</i>

25:33.533 --> 25:36.901
Why don't you peruse my
portfolio for awhile?

25:36.903 --> 25:39.637
It always cheers me up
to look at pictures of men.

25:39.639 --> 25:40.671
Oh, Bernard.

25:40.673 --> 25:44.842
In suits, plus,

25:44.844 --> 25:47.545
a good stiff one
never hurt either.

25:47.547 --> 25:51.115
- You are no lady.
- And you are no gentleman.

25:51.117 --> 25:53.050
- Chin.
- Chin.

25:54.019 --> 25:56.820
Mm, that is good, honey.

25:56.822 --> 26:00.291
Mm-hmm, my one true talent.

26:00.293 --> 26:01.892
Bernard, who is this?

26:03.061 --> 26:06.764
Signet ring,
I've seen it someplace before.

26:06.766 --> 26:09.033
No, you don't want to
bother with that.

26:09.035 --> 26:11.035
Why, who is he?

26:11.037 --> 26:14.638
James Travers, one of those
government big wigs.

26:14.640 --> 26:17.975
In love with himself,
just like the rest of them.

26:17.977 --> 26:19.810
Yeah, well?

26:19.812 --> 26:22.780
I mean, he sat with you for the
length of an entire portrait.

26:22.782 --> 26:24.748
Surely you can tell me a
little bit more about him.

26:24.750 --> 26:26.650
Well, he squirmed
the whole time.

26:26.652 --> 26:28.619
Just like a wriggly
little snake.

26:28.621 --> 26:30.254
Now I hardly find it necessary

26:30.256 --> 26:33.457
to remember those who are
not well-mannered, nor fun.

26:33.459 --> 26:35.359
Introduce me to him.

26:35.361 --> 26:40.264
Well, unfortunately Mr. Travers
and I have lost contact.

26:41.666 --> 26:43.567
Oh.

26:45.403 --> 26:50.074
Oh, well fine, I will be
using your name though

26:50.076 --> 26:52.443
when I call his office.

26:52.445 --> 26:55.112
Oh, thank you.
You've just killed my buzz.

26:55.114 --> 26:58.115
Good, since I've got you
in a lucid moment.

26:58.117 --> 26:59.583
Hmm?

26:59.585 --> 27:04.655
What do you know about high
roller soirees here on the coast?

27:04.657 --> 27:07.424
The kind I wouldn't
be invited to.

27:07.426 --> 27:10.661
Why, because
you're an art dealer?

27:10.663 --> 27:15.332
- Because you're a democrat?
- Because I am an adult woman.

27:16.668 --> 27:19.370
Honey, you can't be serious
about meeting that man.

27:19.372 --> 27:22.473
Oh, I'm serious as sin, honey.
Make it happen.

27:23.742 --> 27:25.643
This is hopeless.

27:43.628 --> 27:46.530
Excuse me, what are you doing?

27:48.466 --> 27:50.467
I came to get some things.

27:51.636 --> 27:53.470
There's nothing of yours
here, so please leave

27:53.472 --> 27:56.140
'cause I got to open up soon.

27:57.442 --> 28:02.312
Look, I know you don't
think much of me.

28:03.548 --> 28:07.418
But I loved David,
and I did everything for him.

28:07.420 --> 28:09.119
Connie Lee,
this is not the time.

28:09.121 --> 28:11.955
Things I'm sure
you wouldn't approve of.

28:11.957 --> 28:16.560
Look, I'm sorry. I'm sure his
death was very painful for you.

28:18.163 --> 28:20.698
You can't stand the idea

28:20.700 --> 28:25.002
that someone was as important
to him as you were.

28:25.004 --> 28:27.638
He was like a son to me.

28:27.640 --> 28:30.808
David could never be happy.

28:30.810 --> 28:34.812
He only wanted attention
from one person

28:36.514 --> 28:38.615
and that was his mother.

28:38.617 --> 28:41.418
Okay, I think
you've said enough.

28:42.754 --> 28:44.855
Would you please leave?

28:53.064 --> 28:58.535
David didn't kill himself.
He had too much to prove.

29:05.477 --> 29:08.345
Austin, honey.

29:08.347 --> 29:12.449
Rosey, listen I'm so
sorry about yesterday.

29:12.451 --> 29:14.551
I just really wanted
to show you my art,

29:14.553 --> 29:17.254
and my passion
got the better of me.

29:17.256 --> 29:18.288
No, no, no, don't
even worry about it.

29:18.290 --> 29:21.091
I wanted to talk, you know we...

29:21.093 --> 29:24.762
We never even talked
about what happened.

29:25.730 --> 29:28.265
You okay?

29:28.267 --> 29:32.069
About David,
it's a terrible thing.

29:32.071 --> 29:33.370
Yeah.

29:33.372 --> 29:36.673
But, I mean, it's not
completely unexpected, right?

29:36.675 --> 29:38.542
Excuse me, what?

29:38.544 --> 29:41.078
- I mean, you had to know.
- Know?

29:41.080 --> 29:44.181
He was coked out of his mind
like all the time.

29:44.183 --> 29:46.717
That girlfriend
of his, Connie Lee...

29:46.719 --> 29:50.053
That's no way to
talk about David.

29:50.055 --> 29:52.189
My god, you didn't know.

29:52.191 --> 29:55.526
You didn't...
You people, you look at David...

29:55.528 --> 30:00.230
You know what, you're right.
We shouldn't talk about it.

30:00.232 --> 30:02.366
Life goes on.

30:02.368 --> 30:05.269
Well, I'm not going to stop until I
found out what happened that night.

30:05.271 --> 30:08.505
You know, it's a suicide, right?

30:08.507 --> 30:10.007
No, it was not.

30:10.009 --> 30:12.142
Leave the police work
to the police, rosey.

30:12.144 --> 30:15.445
Yeah, well the police aren't
doing a god damn freakin' thing.

30:26.758 --> 30:28.292
Hi.

30:28.294 --> 30:29.593
Ms. Wallace, you okay?

30:29.595 --> 30:32.830
Yeah, I want to talk to
you about David's murderer.

30:32.832 --> 30:34.832
Yeah, I know he was murdered.

30:34.834 --> 30:38.101
- What are you doing about it?
- My job.

30:38.103 --> 30:40.237
Look me in the eyes
and tell me you're doing

30:40.239 --> 30:42.172
everything you can
to find David's killer.

30:43.942 --> 30:46.944
Ms. Wallace, we don't even know
yet if there is a David's killer.

30:46.946 --> 30:48.812
The investigation
will prove that.

30:48.814 --> 30:51.815
- Then I guess I'm on my own.
- Ms. Wallace, please.

30:51.817 --> 30:53.283
Why don't you stay
and have a drink?

30:53.285 --> 30:55.352
We can talk about it.

31:02.627 --> 31:04.661
Thank you.

31:04.663 --> 31:06.697
Like a drink?

31:06.699 --> 31:09.499
I'm fine, thanks.

31:10.602 --> 31:13.904
So I know you run the gallery.

31:13.906 --> 31:16.273
Tell me something
about yourself.

31:18.643 --> 31:20.010
You first.

31:20.012 --> 31:24.281
You're not going to
make this easy, are you?

31:24.283 --> 31:26.717
Okay, uh, I'm a local boy.

31:26.719 --> 31:30.053
I was a prom king,
a football star,

31:30.055 --> 31:31.922
you know usual superman stuff.

31:31.924 --> 31:33.991
Now I'm slingin' a badge.

31:33.993 --> 31:36.126
You?

31:37.595 --> 31:40.764
I moved to New York
to be close to Lucy.

31:40.766 --> 31:44.601
She needed someone to
help her with David.

31:44.603 --> 31:50.374
I graduated college with a major
in art, but I had no talent.

31:50.376 --> 31:53.076
So I became a curator.

31:53.078 --> 31:58.248
Suffered through the usual depressing
ups and downs of career and romance.

31:58.250 --> 32:00.851
You don't want to hear
all about that.

32:00.853 --> 32:03.887
No doubt, I hear you.

32:03.889 --> 32:07.958
I just didn't like it there,
so I came to the Gulf.

32:07.960 --> 32:10.260
Heard people were friendly here.

32:10.262 --> 32:13.030
They are.

32:13.032 --> 32:15.365
I'm going to do everything
i can on this case

32:15.367 --> 32:18.702
and get you as much information
as I can, I promise.

32:18.704 --> 32:21.738
- Thank you.
- Of course.

32:23.808 --> 32:26.677
I have to go.

32:26.679 --> 32:29.446
Let me know if
you hear anything.

32:29.448 --> 32:31.581
- I will.
- Thank you.

32:31.583 --> 32:36.620
Oh, I found this ring on
the floor of the gallery.

32:36.622 --> 32:39.389
I don't know who it belongs to.

32:42.360 --> 32:45.329
I'll be sure to
look into it for you.

33:05.451 --> 33:07.317
Hey, con.

33:09.787 --> 33:11.188
John.

33:11.823 --> 33:13.957
Yeah, it's me.

33:15.527 --> 33:17.227
Imagine that.

33:19.530 --> 33:25.302
This... this is a nice bike.

33:29.173 --> 33:31.408
Going on a trip?

33:31.410 --> 33:34.277
Figure I'd head to New Orleans

33:34.279 --> 33:37.114
for a couple days,
clear my head.

33:37.116 --> 33:38.315
David, you know.

33:38.317 --> 33:42.753
Yeah, that was...
That was so sad.

33:44.722 --> 33:46.857
Such a talent.

33:48.459 --> 33:50.394
We are all going to miss him.

33:51.530 --> 33:53.397
Thing is, con...

33:56.134 --> 33:58.535
before you go...

33:58.537 --> 34:03.140
you've got something of mine.

34:04.642 --> 34:08.712
John, I went back to the
gallery to try and find it.

34:08.714 --> 34:11.415
I figured David had
stashed it somewhere,

34:11.417 --> 34:15.152
but when I went in there
the owner came in

34:15.154 --> 34:18.855
and chased me out.
It's got to still be there.

34:20.291 --> 34:23.060
The owner, huh?

34:23.062 --> 34:24.995
Connie...

34:27.065 --> 34:30.132
why did you
have to fuck up so bad?

34:47.784 --> 34:49.553
Hey!

34:51.355 --> 34:53.389
Get away, get away, get away, get away,
get away, get away, get away, get away!

34:53.391 --> 34:55.092
Beverly, it's me. It's me,
I'm not going to hurt you.

34:55.094 --> 34:56.960
I just want to
know what you saw.

34:56.962 --> 34:59.262
Just tell me what you saw.

35:00.465 --> 35:03.366
What I did see.
Yeah.

35:03.368 --> 35:06.503
What I did see
about the fancy man.

35:06.505 --> 35:07.871
What fancy man?

35:07.873 --> 35:11.975
That man has a fancy suit
and a fancy car

35:11.977 --> 35:15.579
and he was in a very
big hurry that night.

35:15.581 --> 35:17.647
- That night that that boy...
- - What guy?

35:17.649 --> 35:22.119
That night that that boy...
Was killed that night.

35:22.121 --> 35:25.622
Okay, okay, tell me
exactly what you saw.

35:25.624 --> 35:28.358
Okay, I did, i did see that boy.

35:28.360 --> 35:31.862
I did see that boy... I did see that
boy and that boy that he was doing...

35:31.864 --> 35:34.364
He was doing things...
He was doing things.

35:34.366 --> 35:38.902
And... and then I couldn't...
I didn't see him very good.

35:38.904 --> 35:41.138
That boy didn't have
all the lights on.

35:41.140 --> 35:43.874
He didn't turn on
all the lights.

35:43.876 --> 35:46.143
So and then the fancy man comes.

35:46.145 --> 35:51.014
<i>That fancy man comes... That fancy
man comes and he just goes in there</i>

35:51.016 --> 35:54.284
and then they, they, they...

35:54.286 --> 35:55.452
They, they, they what?

35:55.454 --> 35:56.520
They what? What were they?

35:58.290 --> 36:01.725
<i>They hugged, they were hugging
for a very long time.</i>

36:01.727 --> 36:04.895
And then I couldn't see anymore.

36:04.897 --> 36:05.996
<i>I didn't...</i>

36:08.066 --> 36:11.568
Tell me whatever you can
about him, whatever you can.

36:11.570 --> 36:13.637
Whatever you remember.

36:15.273 --> 36:18.275
I did see the license tag.

36:18.277 --> 36:19.843
<i>I did see that.</i>

36:19.845 --> 36:21.578
<i>Do you remember what it was?</i>

36:21.580 --> 36:27.517
There was a state, state car
m-m-k-m-m-m-k-m-two-two-one.

36:27.519 --> 36:30.654
M-k-m-two-two-one,
m-k-m-two-two-one.

36:30.656 --> 36:32.622
Okay, thank you, okay,
m-k-m-two-two-one.

36:32.624 --> 36:34.858
- I remember that one.
- Thank you so much, Beverly.

36:34.860 --> 36:37.227
I remember that one.

36:43.334 --> 36:44.634
Hey.

36:45.903 --> 36:49.239
- I got your call.
- Yeah, I got some information.

36:49.241 --> 36:52.409
You know Beverly,
the homeless lady?

36:52.411 --> 36:53.577
Mm-hmm.

36:53.579 --> 36:55.912
She saw something that night.

36:55.914 --> 36:58.582
- What do you mean?
- After everyone had left except David,

36:58.584 --> 37:01.284
he had a visitor,
someone in an SUV.

37:01.286 --> 37:03.820
Here's the license plate.

37:03.822 --> 37:07.624
Um... it had a state seal on it.

37:07.626 --> 37:10.427
You think you could
look into that for me?

37:10.429 --> 37:12.729
Yeah, yeah, of course.

37:17.068 --> 37:19.302
It's beautiful here.

37:22.673 --> 37:24.741
Yeah, it is.

37:27.245 --> 37:30.847
David's mother, how's she doin'?

37:30.849 --> 37:34.317
She won't talk to me.
She won't see me.

37:36.787 --> 37:38.755
Seems like no matter what I do,

37:38.757 --> 37:40.824
I'm losing everyone
i care about.

37:40.826 --> 37:42.792
No, no.

37:42.794 --> 37:46.529
Look, you can't blame yourself
for any of this, rose.

37:53.604 --> 37:55.438
You married?

37:57.842 --> 37:59.576
Was.

38:01.045 --> 38:02.312
Prom queen?

38:02.314 --> 38:04.614
Something like that.

38:04.616 --> 38:07.083
Didn't work out.

38:07.852 --> 38:09.052
What about you?

38:09.054 --> 38:13.556
No, no, it's another thing
I'm not good at.

38:14.759 --> 38:16.092
<i>You know, when I
was a kid my mom used</i>

38:16.094 --> 38:18.295
to send me to my daddy's
girlfriend's house.

38:18.297 --> 38:19.596
Bring him back home for dinner.

38:20.699 --> 38:22.766
What chance did I have?

38:25.636 --> 38:29.072
- Scarred for life, huh?
- God, I hope not.

38:37.715 --> 38:40.050
Stay right here, okay?

38:42.320 --> 38:44.988
- You wait here, okay?
- Okay.

38:47.458 --> 38:50.794
How you doin', man?
How you doin', brother?

38:50.796 --> 38:51.895
Good to see you.

38:54.899 --> 38:56.399
Take care of her.

39:02.873 --> 39:06.009
I got rosemund our there.

39:18.622 --> 39:20.757
Come on.

39:20.759 --> 39:22.492
Thank you.

39:26.364 --> 39:29.099
- Mm.
- Doctor mcgowan.

39:29.101 --> 39:32.635
Ms. Wallace,
what a pleasure to see you.

39:32.637 --> 39:35.505
- Oh, likewise.
- Please, sit down.

39:35.507 --> 39:37.140
Thank you.

39:38.042 --> 39:40.343
Can I get you a cocktail?

39:40.345 --> 39:44.414
Oh, a gin Martini
with an olive, please.

39:44.416 --> 39:46.549
I'm so sorry to be
disturbing your meal.

39:46.551 --> 39:48.852
Not at all, not at all.

39:50.554 --> 39:52.722
What a beautiful ring.

39:52.724 --> 39:54.157
Oh, hmm.

39:54.159 --> 39:57.694
- Family crest?
- Oh, quite so, mm.

39:59.697 --> 40:03.199
Well, I think
congratulations are in order

40:03.201 --> 40:06.569
for the Lucy moon gala.

40:06.571 --> 40:09.472
Oh, regrettably
the event was marred

40:09.474 --> 40:12.008
by the death of that poor boy.

40:12.010 --> 40:17.847
Yes, losing David
broke my heart.

40:17.849 --> 40:20.450
I'm so sorry. Thank you.

40:20.452 --> 40:21.885
Thank you, sir.

40:21.887 --> 40:25.889
I read somewhere that he was
a promising media artist.

40:25.891 --> 40:29.292
Which is why I would never
believe he committed suicide.

40:29.294 --> 40:30.894
Right.

40:32.129 --> 40:36.099
Rosemund, may i
call you rosemund?

40:36.101 --> 40:37.434
Please.

40:37.436 --> 40:40.603
Could we just lay this
aside just for the moment?

40:40.605 --> 40:43.540
It's so sad, so dreadful.

40:48.312 --> 40:54.117
Now, I understand you're preparing
to showcase Mayo's work.

40:54.119 --> 40:57.720
Oh, I love what he does.

40:57.722 --> 41:01.458
Oh, well, Mayo Johnson's
a very lucky man.

41:01.460 --> 41:05.161
I'm not totally unaware
of your reputation.

41:05.163 --> 41:07.530
It seems you have
a discerning eye

41:07.532 --> 41:10.300
for discovering young talent.

41:10.302 --> 41:12.502
- Thank you.

41:13.037 --> 41:15.338
Um...

41:15.340 --> 41:19.642
To be candid, I didn't come
here to discuss Mayo's work.

41:19.644 --> 41:23.746
Although, at another time,
it would give me great pleasure.

41:23.748 --> 41:26.115
Really?

41:27.284 --> 41:28.318
Yes.

41:28.320 --> 41:31.054
Then why are we here?

41:32.656 --> 41:35.058
James Travers.

41:38.028 --> 41:40.463
The scoundrel that
sits on the right hand

41:40.465 --> 41:43.399
of our illustrious governor

41:43.401 --> 41:47.837
who uses a facade
of power to impress

41:47.839 --> 41:52.976
and elicit certain favors
from young men.

41:54.745 --> 41:58.114
Seems you have an almost
intimate familiarity with him.

41:58.116 --> 42:00.250
Well, this is Mississippi.

42:00.252 --> 42:01.885
Oh, yes.

42:03.120 --> 42:07.957
Mayo seems to think that David
and Travers knew each other.

42:07.959 --> 42:13.930
Now I was hoping you might be able to
help me get to the bottom of this.

42:13.932 --> 42:17.967
Trust me, I will get
to the bottom of this.

42:17.969 --> 42:21.070
If Travers had anything to do
with David moon's death,

42:21.072 --> 42:25.575
believe you me,
justice will be swift.

42:25.577 --> 42:27.410
I can assure you of that.

42:29.513 --> 42:33.783
Oh, my, as one gets
older the hands of time

42:33.785 --> 42:37.720
do most inexorably
quicken their pace.

42:37.722 --> 42:42.458
I wonder what Mr. Einstein
would have to say about that?

42:42.460 --> 42:43.626
Hm?

42:43.628 --> 42:47.130
Well, can I say goodbye?

42:47.132 --> 42:51.568
I hope we meet again.

43:01.545 --> 43:02.879
You better stay close.

43:02.881 --> 43:04.948
I might need you later.

43:04.950 --> 43:06.316
Yes, sir.

43:28.439 --> 43:29.739
- Hi.
- Hey.

43:29.741 --> 43:30.940
- Hey.
- You okay?

43:30.942 --> 43:33.276
- Yeah.
- What a day.

43:33.278 --> 43:36.946
Can I have coffee, black please?
Thank you.

43:36.948 --> 43:39.515
You know, I could
get fired for this.

43:39.517 --> 43:43.086
But before you look at it,
it's not nice, okay?

43:45.289 --> 43:46.823
It's a brand.

43:48.025 --> 43:49.659
We found it on David's thigh.

43:51.363 --> 43:53.663
Oh, my god.

43:53.665 --> 43:57.166
Medical examiner says it's
been there a week, two at most.

43:58.836 --> 44:02.705
There's something
familiar about the shape.

44:03.507 --> 44:04.941
What do you mean?

44:04.943 --> 44:06.142
Reminds me
of the ring I gave you.

44:06.144 --> 44:07.276
The one I found at the gallery.

44:07.278 --> 44:11.547
The inscription.
Come to think about it,

44:11.549 --> 44:13.416
a lot like the
symbol on the ring

44:13.418 --> 44:16.119
<i>Walter mcgowan was wearing.</i>

44:16.121 --> 44:18.554
<i>Dr. mcgowan?</i>

44:18.556 --> 44:22.158
Yes, I had drinks
with him last night.

44:22.160 --> 44:23.893
Rose, have you been
playing detective again?

44:23.895 --> 44:27.397
No. Business.

44:27.399 --> 44:29.966
Okay, look,
I'll get one of my lab guys

44:29.968 --> 44:31.200
to look into it.

44:31.202 --> 44:33.403
Also, that plate
you wanted me to run.

44:33.405 --> 44:35.138
Says that it was a state
motor pool vehicle.

44:35.140 --> 44:37.507
So we'll work out who
was driving it that night.

44:37.509 --> 44:39.208
I know it was Travers.

44:39.210 --> 44:40.943
Rose, you can't just
make assumptions like that.

44:40.945 --> 44:42.912
You're going to find
yourself in court.

44:42.914 --> 44:45.448
- You've got to be patient.
- I have no Patience.

44:45.450 --> 44:48.418
I know.

44:50.087 --> 44:54.157
Look, what do you say we,
uh, we get out of here.

44:54.159 --> 44:58.394
I'll take you home.
It's going to be okay.

45:00.864 --> 45:02.632
<i>Check, please.</i>

49:16.853 --> 49:19.155
Rose, it's me.

49:20.157 --> 49:22.591
I got some bad news.

49:23.994 --> 49:27.496
Rosemund, you have visitors.

49:28.799 --> 49:31.400
- What the hell's that?
- Twenty grand.

49:31.402 --> 49:32.835
Do you want me to get that?

49:32.837 --> 49:35.371
No, no, no, no, I'll get it.

49:38.108 --> 49:41.777
Bernard, hi.

49:44.448 --> 49:46.749
Pleasure to meet you,
Mr. Travers.

49:46.751 --> 49:48.517
Thank you so much
for taking the time

49:48.519 --> 49:51.153
- while you're down here on the coast.
- Of course.

49:51.155 --> 49:54.490
And I must say, you are
as handsome as your portrait.

49:54.492 --> 49:58.060
- What portrait?
- The one Bernard did of you.

49:58.062 --> 50:03.032
And I was so taken with that
beautiful ring you were wearing.

50:03.034 --> 50:05.067
I have several.

50:05.069 --> 50:09.271
This Mayo fella is terrific.

50:09.273 --> 50:11.507
Lord of the woods indeed.

50:11.509 --> 50:13.175
Lord of the woods?

50:13.177 --> 50:14.744
- Heard of <i> lord of the flies?</i>
<i>- Uh-huh.</i>

50:14.746 --> 50:16.045
It's lord of the woods.

50:16.047 --> 50:17.847
That's just how the
artist refers to himself.

50:17.849 --> 50:22.051
He feels his calling
is to find life,

50:22.053 --> 50:25.588
you know, give life
to orphan drift wood.

50:25.590 --> 50:29.425
What makes Mayo's work
so special

50:29.427 --> 50:32.528
is that he finds the drift wood,
and sees the animal in it.

50:32.530 --> 50:33.596
Huh.

50:33.598 --> 50:35.531
Then he simply
paints what he sees.

50:35.533 --> 50:37.533
Well, I'm not really
much of an art lover.

50:37.535 --> 50:39.702
It's more of the governor
and his wife's thing.

50:39.704 --> 50:43.639
So why don't you just
show me what you recommend.

50:48.111 --> 50:52.048
It's interesting,
but a little dark.

50:52.050 --> 50:54.517
Not really the governor's
taste, I'm afraid.

50:54.519 --> 50:56.986
Oh, I'm sorry,
i was thinking of you.

50:56.988 --> 51:00.122
I thought it would be
right up your alley.

51:02.893 --> 51:05.728
- What do you mean?
- Mm, the dark side.

51:05.730 --> 51:09.632
The red rope, the black plastic.

51:11.068 --> 51:15.071
Why do I get a feeling this little
field trip was simply a pretext?

51:16.907 --> 51:19.642
You were the last person
to see David moon alive.

51:21.044 --> 51:25.448
You know, wild imagination's
no defense against slander.

51:26.383 --> 51:27.416
I'm going to have to remember to

51:27.418 --> 51:30.553
thank Bernard
for this little adventure.

51:30.555 --> 51:33.055
You were here that night.

51:33.057 --> 51:35.658
You want to be careful,
Ms. Wallace.

51:35.660 --> 51:39.295
You don't know who
you're dealing with.

51:41.565 --> 51:42.998
You take care now.

51:43.000 --> 51:44.433
Oh, you, too.

51:50.941 --> 51:54.276
Ah, well, I'm glad to
see they looked after you.

51:54.278 --> 51:56.245
Oh, yeah, thanks.

51:56.247 --> 52:00.850
Well, there is somethin'
i need you to listen to.

52:00.852 --> 52:03.352
Oh, all right.

52:03.354 --> 52:06.355
<i>You want to
be careful, Ms. Wallace.</i>

52:06.357 --> 52:08.557
<i>You don't know who
you're dealing with.</i>

52:10.061 --> 52:12.328
Now I'm telling you,
this is our guy.

52:12.330 --> 52:18.067
I know, but this is not enough
to convene a grand jury.

52:18.069 --> 52:19.768
Now, I'll get my contacts

52:19.770 --> 52:22.238
and I'll try to get
more information, all right?

52:22.240 --> 52:25.541
Well, here, down the hatch.

52:25.543 --> 52:27.376
Mm!

52:28.478 --> 52:29.545
Thank you.

52:29.547 --> 52:34.183
Mm, ah, mm. Thank you.

52:36.119 --> 52:38.287
Enjoy your day.

52:42.526 --> 52:44.560
Travers threatened me.
I have it on tape.

52:44.562 --> 52:46.795
- Oh, my god.
- He killed David. I know it.

52:46.797 --> 52:50.032
I... when I was cleaning up
the mess at the gallery,

52:50.034 --> 52:52.668
I found a ring that had
an inscription on it.

52:52.670 --> 52:56.338
The same inscription that was on
Travers' ring in your portrait.

52:56.340 --> 53:01.477
They both look exactly like a
brand they found on David's leg.

53:01.479 --> 53:03.445
A brand?

53:06.049 --> 53:11.453
Now that I think about it, mcgowan's
ring had the same inscription.

53:11.755 --> 53:12.955
What?

53:12.957 --> 53:16.058
Nothin', nothin' just...
I think you ought

53:16.060 --> 53:18.894
to be a little more careful about who
you go around accusing of murder.

53:18.896 --> 53:21.864
- He was not at the opening.
- Well, so what?

53:21.866 --> 53:25.234
So, he lost his ring
the night he killed David.

53:25.236 --> 53:28.237
Rosemund, do you know how
many people wear signet rings?

53:28.239 --> 53:31.140
Not with that symbol.
It means something.

53:31.142 --> 53:33.742
Yes, that you are
trying to ruin me.

53:33.744 --> 53:34.977
What?

53:34.979 --> 53:38.347
Honey, don't you remember,
i introduced you two.

53:38.349 --> 53:40.649
He's going to think I'm all
caught up in this madness,

53:40.651 --> 53:43.052
that I, that I set him up.

53:43.054 --> 53:47.723
Bernard... we've been
friends for years.

53:47.725 --> 53:51.927
I know when you are
hiding something from me.

53:56.032 --> 53:57.733
Oh, hell.

54:01.304 --> 54:05.674
The inscription on that ring
is a symbol of the order.

54:05.676 --> 54:11.113
A very private and extremely
powerful men's organization.

54:11.115 --> 54:14.683
Its members provide
unswerving support

54:14.685 --> 54:20.422
for its members' business
and political agendas.

54:20.424 --> 54:23.592
What about personal?

54:24.327 --> 54:26.161
That, too.

54:26.163 --> 54:29.999
And one way to insure
a profitable future

54:30.001 --> 54:33.702
is to recruit young,
fresh talent.

54:33.704 --> 54:37.706
And that's where
the parties come in handy.

54:38.942 --> 54:40.676
<i>It was the practice of the order</i>

54:40.678 --> 54:44.713
<i>to invite promising young men
to certain gatherings.</i>

54:44.715 --> 54:48.083
<i>As part of a selection process.</i>

54:48.085 --> 54:50.819
<i>They were social events
where the members had a chance</i>

54:50.821 --> 54:54.056
<i>to get acquainted
with the hopefuls.</i>

54:54.058 --> 54:56.091
<i>But at a point,
the gatherings began</i>

54:56.093 --> 55:00.596
<i>to take on a sharp edge
of competitiveness.</i>

55:00.598 --> 55:03.866
<i>On one occasion the vying
actually turned violent.</i>

55:03.868 --> 55:06.568
<i>Now this kind of behavior</i>

55:06.570 --> 55:09.938
<i>is in complete contradiction
to the order,</i>

55:09.940 --> 55:12.474
<i>- and abhorrent to it's members.</i>

55:12.476 --> 55:17.680
<i>Except for a small circle
who seemed to encourage it.</i>

55:17.682 --> 55:20.449
<i>This inner group went so far
in their dark behavior,</i>

55:20.451 --> 55:24.019
<i>as to eventually mark
their own flesh with a brand</i>

55:24.021 --> 55:27.056
<i>in the shape of
the order's symbol.</i>

55:27.058 --> 55:32.695
<i>And among the most prominent
was James Travers.</i>

55:32.697 --> 55:35.431
<i>Word began to spread
that he and his little group</i>

55:35.433 --> 55:37.633
<i>were making promises
of membership,</i>

55:37.635 --> 55:41.136
<i>and career favors to some
of the susceptible youth</i>

55:41.138 --> 55:48.177
<i>in exchange for pharmaceutical
and sexual services.</i>

56:03.226 --> 56:08.664
I am so sorry that you
had to hear this from me.

56:12.569 --> 56:14.236
Would you come outside
with me for a second?

56:14.238 --> 56:17.039
I think I need to
get some fresh air.

56:20.944 --> 56:24.179
Shit. I told Austin
to fix those breakers.

56:24.181 --> 56:27.249
I don't know why he
never listened to me.

56:34.023 --> 56:35.290
I'll go check the fuse box,

56:35.292 --> 56:37.025
you yell when the
lights come on, okay?

56:37.027 --> 56:40.996
- I am coming with you.
- No, I need you to stay here.

56:57.280 --> 56:59.581
Bernard, you got somethin?

56:59.583 --> 57:04.286
Shhh, shhh, shhh.

57:05.488 --> 57:09.591
Bernard is napping
and unless you want to join him

57:09.593 --> 57:12.060
I suggest you
hand over my money.

57:12.062 --> 57:13.829
What? I...

57:13.831 --> 57:15.964
I don't know what
you're talking about.

57:15.966 --> 57:18.600
Let me elucidate.
You remember Connie?

57:18.602 --> 57:24.206
Connie said you have the cash
Davey got for my product.

57:24.208 --> 57:27.142
I told you, I don't...
I don't know what you're...

57:27.144 --> 57:30.579
Think again.
Is it coming to you?

57:30.581 --> 57:33.882
Okay, okay.
Oh, god.

57:33.884 --> 57:37.619
It's upstairs...
It's upstairs in my office.

57:38.521 --> 57:40.622
That's more like it.

57:59.042 --> 58:01.543
I'm a little pressed
for time here.

58:01.545 --> 58:03.512
Where the fuck is it?

58:06.416 --> 58:09.985
Open it!
Open the god damn box!

58:14.324 --> 58:16.725
What the fuck is this?
What the fuck is this?

58:16.727 --> 58:18.760
Police, hands!

58:20.096 --> 58:24.066
- Let her go.
- Oh, great, a fucking cowboy.

58:24.601 --> 58:26.902
It's over.

58:26.904 --> 58:30.639
Put the gun down, detective.
Now!

58:32.442 --> 58:36.912
Or cross my heart, I will cut
this bitch where she stands.

58:46.289 --> 58:48.156
Attaboy.

58:48.158 --> 58:52.427
Over here.
Over here!

01:00:06.469 --> 01:00:09.304
I'll be right back, don't worry.

01:00:12.775 --> 01:00:14.209
- Keep an eye on him, okay?
- You got it.

01:00:14.211 --> 01:00:15.844
Thank you.

01:00:18.214 --> 01:00:20.282
Hey, baby, come on, it's okay.

01:00:20.284 --> 01:00:23.151
It's okay, it's okay, it's okay.

01:00:26.155 --> 01:00:30.659
- Sorry.
- Don't be sorry.

01:00:30.661 --> 01:00:33.795
I'm sorry I didn't
keep you safe.

01:00:35.698 --> 01:00:38.367
I thought he was
going to kill me.

01:00:38.369 --> 01:00:39.868
No, no. No one's
going to hurt you.

01:00:39.870 --> 01:00:41.637
No one's going to
hurt you again.

01:00:41.639 --> 01:00:44.106
You hear me? I'm here.

01:00:55.318 --> 01:00:58.086
Yeah, hi, Jim.

01:00:58.688 --> 01:01:00.756
Sit down. Please.

01:01:03.660 --> 01:01:05.027
How's Betsy?

01:01:05.029 --> 01:01:07.729
Well, she's good, Walter.
Thanks for asking.

01:01:09.433 --> 01:01:13.201
Yeah, we've had a few newsworthy
events around the Gulf area here.

01:01:13.203 --> 01:01:16.371
- Mm-hmm.
- You been here recently?

01:01:16.373 --> 01:01:18.006
Yes, sir.

01:01:18.008 --> 01:01:20.142
I was assessing some art for
the governor's new office.

01:01:20.144 --> 01:01:21.576
Hm...

01:01:23.913 --> 01:01:26.314
Where would that be?

01:01:26.316 --> 01:01:27.783
At the Wallace gallery.

01:01:27.785 --> 01:01:30.318
You know they specialize
in local artists.

01:01:30.320 --> 01:01:32.654
Oh, yeah, the Wallace...

01:01:32.656 --> 01:01:37.325
Isn't that the place where
that young boy hanged himself?

01:01:37.327 --> 01:01:40.095
I believe it is.

01:01:40.430 --> 01:01:41.897
Hm.

01:01:43.332 --> 01:01:46.268
You know anything
about that boy?

01:01:46.270 --> 01:01:50.672
- No, sir.
- - No...

01:01:50.674 --> 01:01:53.041
A little wine?

01:01:53.043 --> 01:01:57.779
So you telling me that he never
attended any of your special parties?

01:01:57.781 --> 01:01:58.914
I beg your pardon.

01:01:58.916 --> 01:02:00.949
<i>Aw, Jesus, don't be coy with me.</i>

01:02:00.951 --> 01:02:03.652
You know perfectly well
what I'm talking about!

01:02:05.621 --> 01:02:07.622
You can save us a lot of time,

01:02:07.624 --> 01:02:11.259
just tell me the connection
you have to David.

01:02:11.261 --> 01:02:13.295
You know, Walter,
sometimes I have to

01:02:13.297 --> 01:02:16.565
do certain things for the
governor's special guests.

01:02:16.567 --> 01:02:18.800
Maybe that's what
you're referring to.

01:02:18.802 --> 01:02:20.435
Don't fuck with me, boy.

01:02:23.840 --> 01:02:26.441
All right. All right.

01:02:27.543 --> 01:02:29.177
Yeah, I met David at
one of those parties.

01:02:29.179 --> 01:02:33.281
- Oh. - Had some big enterprise
that needed funding.

01:02:33.283 --> 01:02:36.351
Look, I liked him,
so I introduced him around.

01:02:36.353 --> 01:02:38.687
Turns out other
people liked him, too.

01:02:38.689 --> 01:02:41.523
You telling me he came
groveling to you for money,

01:02:41.525 --> 01:02:45.060
when I had all the
money in the world?

01:02:47.663 --> 01:02:51.099
Why did he do that?

01:02:51.101 --> 01:02:53.635
I don't know, Walter.

01:02:53.637 --> 01:02:56.204
But he didn't ask you,
he asked me.

01:02:56.206 --> 01:02:57.539
He came to me.

01:02:58.608 --> 01:03:02.711
Hell, I came to
that boy's rescue.

01:03:03.646 --> 01:03:06.448
Your perversity killed that boy.

01:03:06.450 --> 01:03:08.450
I know there's nothing
i can do about that now.

01:03:08.452 --> 01:03:11.086
But there is something
i can do about the threat

01:03:11.088 --> 01:03:14.823
that you created against
our entire order!

01:03:16.225 --> 01:03:18.426
Oh, god, do you have any idea
what would happen here

01:03:18.428 --> 01:03:20.962
if the press got wind
of this damn thing,

01:03:20.964 --> 01:03:22.397
and came down here investigating

01:03:22.399 --> 01:03:23.899
the most powerful
man in the state?

01:03:23.901 --> 01:03:26.301
<i>Have you?</i>

01:03:26.303 --> 01:03:29.437
They'd be mortified by
your perverted parties

01:03:29.439 --> 01:03:33.375
<i>and your debauched behavior.</i>

01:03:33.377 --> 01:03:35.177
You corrupted that boy.

01:03:35.179 --> 01:03:37.045
You may not have done it
personally, but you did.

01:03:37.047 --> 01:03:39.047
You killed him, I say.

01:03:39.049 --> 01:03:41.416
You killed him with
your own fucking hands!

01:03:41.418 --> 01:03:44.252
<i>You son of a bitch!</i>

01:03:46.489 --> 01:03:48.356
Walter.

01:03:49.926 --> 01:03:51.793
Dr. mcgowan.

01:03:53.563 --> 01:03:55.897
Please.

01:04:01.003 --> 01:04:05.907
You know I have been a loyal
foot soldier for over 20 years!

01:04:09.512 --> 01:04:11.746
It's got to mean somethin'.

01:04:13.482 --> 01:04:15.784
It ain't worth shit.

01:04:17.553 --> 01:04:19.921
Mayo?

01:04:19.923 --> 01:04:24.125
Could you escort this man
out of the front door?

01:04:24.127 --> 01:04:26.261
And lock it behind him.

01:04:36.639 --> 01:04:39.541
Fuck you, Walter!

01:05:25.021 --> 01:05:26.922
Okay, so make it
easy on yourself. Huh?

01:05:26.924 --> 01:05:28.990
Tell me who was
in the car that night.

01:05:28.992 --> 01:05:31.226
I already told you,
the information is restricted!

01:05:31.228 --> 01:05:33.762
I heard you the first time.
Who?

01:05:33.764 --> 01:05:36.498
Travers, James Travers.

01:05:51.380 --> 01:05:53.848
Thanks.

01:05:53.850 --> 01:05:57.819
Yeah, detective
Bob meyers, please.

01:05:58.955 --> 01:06:01.056
Hey, yeah, Bob, it's Mike.

01:06:01.058 --> 01:06:04.726
Yeah, I'm good,
i need another favor.

01:06:04.728 --> 01:06:08.263
Good, I'm looking
for a James Travers.

01:06:24.647 --> 01:06:29.117
Mayo... what are you doing here?

01:06:29.119 --> 01:06:32.721
Ms. Wallace, I didn't
mean to scare you none.

01:06:34.056 --> 01:06:37.292
I just needed to say
goodbye to my animals.

01:06:38.394 --> 01:06:41.029
Goodbye? Where are you going?

01:06:41.031 --> 01:06:43.064
Oh, somewhere.

01:06:43.066 --> 01:06:49.070
It seem like trouble always got
a way of catching up to me.

01:06:51.607 --> 01:06:57.012
Mayo, good luck to you.

01:06:59.749 --> 01:07:02.751
I'm real sorry
about that boy, ma'am.

01:07:17.067 --> 01:07:19.267
- Hey.
- Rose, it's me.

01:07:19.269 --> 01:07:21.836
Yeah, look, it looks like we've
finally got a break in the case.

01:07:21.838 --> 01:07:24.939
- What? -<i> Look, I just spoke
to the medical examiner.</i>

01:07:24.941 --> 01:07:28.376
Looks like you were right, rose.
David was murdered.

01:07:28.378 --> 01:07:29.944
<i>Yeah, I'm sorry.</i>

01:07:29.946 --> 01:07:31.746
Oh, my god, I knew it.

01:07:31.748 --> 01:07:33.281
<i>Look, also Travers,</i>

01:07:33.283 --> 01:07:35.650
right now he's our prime
suspect and he's missing.

01:07:35.652 --> 01:07:36.785
<i>What do you mean?</i>

01:07:36.787 --> 01:07:38.787
We can't find him.

01:07:38.789 --> 01:07:41.156
Well, what's next then?

01:07:41.158 --> 01:07:44.192
Don't worry, we got a statewide
lookout on him right now.

01:07:44.194 --> 01:07:48.530
- Okay, thank you, Michael.
- Look, you stay safe, okay?

01:07:48.532 --> 01:07:50.031
<i>I'll call you
as soon as I get back.</i>

01:07:50.033 --> 01:07:51.900
- Bye.
- <i>Bye.</i>

01:08:04.046 --> 01:08:06.247
<i>Rosemund, it's me.</i>

01:08:06.249 --> 01:08:10.452
<i>I really don't know how to explain
to you what I'm feeling right now.</i>

01:08:10.454 --> 01:08:12.420
<i>But the best I can do is</i>

01:08:12.422 --> 01:08:16.491
<i>to tell you that
you're my one true friend.</i>

01:08:16.493 --> 01:08:18.225
<i>That I love you.</i>

01:08:19.728 --> 01:08:25.767
<i>See, my life has been built on
this one excruciating secret,</i>

01:08:27.536 --> 01:08:30.404
<i>and I've just never been able
to exorcise it.</i>

01:08:30.407 --> 01:08:34.776
<i>No matter how many times I tried
to paint it out of myself.</i>

01:08:37.513 --> 01:08:42.015
<i>So the way I see it,
I've got one way out.</i>

01:08:42.018 --> 01:08:46.854
<i>That's to go to the source
of my pain and to end it.</i>

01:08:50.859 --> 01:08:55.796
<i>And with David gone,
I'm not afraid of that anymore.</i>

01:08:58.667 --> 01:09:04.139
<i>So I finally realized that the only
thing left for me to do is to go home.</i>

01:09:04.140 --> 01:09:11.145
To my real home, where it all
started, and where it will all end.

01:09:15.384 --> 01:09:17.685
<i>I love you, bye.</i>

01:09:20.990 --> 01:09:22.590
<i>Oh, shit.</i>

01:10:22.851 --> 01:10:24.852
<i>Michael, Lucy's in trouble.</i>

01:10:24.854 --> 01:10:26.387
<i>Trouble, what are you talking about?
What kind of trouble?</i>

01:10:26.389 --> 01:10:27.488
I'm headed there now.

01:10:27.490 --> 01:10:29.123
You do not go there
without me, okay?

01:10:29.125 --> 01:10:31.893
Sorry, I can't. Just get there
as fast as you can.

01:10:31.895 --> 01:10:35.363
It's the old mcgowan
home on beach road, okay? Hurry.

01:11:27.850 --> 01:11:31.753
<i>No, please.
No, daddy, no!</i>

01:11:31.755 --> 01:11:34.956
If you need anything, call me.

01:12:21.570 --> 01:12:24.205
I knew you'd come.

01:12:26.141 --> 01:12:29.944
I sensed you drifting
up the stairs.

01:12:32.314 --> 01:12:34.716
I always could, you know?

01:12:39.221 --> 01:12:44.459
<i>I come up here when I
want to be close to you.</i>

01:12:44.461 --> 01:12:46.994
<i>Your paintings on the wall.</i>

01:12:48.831 --> 01:12:52.600
You are not just my daughter...

01:12:55.304 --> 01:12:58.506
you are the love of my life.

01:13:03.612 --> 01:13:06.681
My heart's desire.

01:13:07.950 --> 01:13:10.918
Oh, I know, I know,

01:13:10.920 --> 01:13:14.522
the world will never condone
our special relationship.

01:13:14.524 --> 01:13:20.995
But you and I, you and I,

01:13:20.997 --> 01:13:24.999
we know that it was right.

01:13:28.404 --> 01:13:34.409
David, poor... poor David.

01:13:36.845 --> 01:13:41.349
A combination of your
creativity and my brilliance.

01:13:43.685 --> 01:13:48.055
<i>David was a true genius.</i>

01:13:50.793 --> 01:13:54.529
Unlike his half-brother, Austin.

01:13:54.531 --> 01:13:59.300
<i>He's a disappointment, really.</i>

01:14:06.375 --> 01:14:09.844
I have no more secrets
from the world.

01:14:11.013 --> 01:14:12.880
Except one.

01:14:15.818 --> 01:14:21.422
I love you
with all my heart, Lucy.

01:14:24.359 --> 01:14:28.729
I want to get together again,
just you and me.

01:14:33.101 --> 01:14:37.038
Please, Lucy, please.

01:14:41.210 --> 01:14:44.612
You and I, together again.

01:15:30.259 --> 01:15:34.228
- I was the one.
- What?

01:15:34.230 --> 01:15:36.097
Austin,
what the hell are you...?

01:15:36.099 --> 01:15:40.301
What? Oh, Jesus Christ.

01:15:40.303 --> 01:15:42.436
David was a dilettante.

01:15:42.438 --> 01:15:44.539
I could have made you proud.

01:15:44.541 --> 01:15:49.677
Austin, you've always
made me proud, always.

01:15:49.679 --> 01:15:54.448
Is that right? Dad.

01:16:01.490 --> 01:16:05.092
All right.
Austin, listen to me.

01:16:05.094 --> 01:16:08.930
Now just listen, i was
planning on telling you.

01:16:08.932 --> 01:16:11.899
Now I've been a bit of a
coward about it, I admit.

01:16:11.901 --> 01:16:15.136
But I never really
found the right moment.

01:16:15.138 --> 01:16:17.605
Yeah, there's never really
a right moment, is there, dad?

01:16:17.607 --> 01:16:19.840
When your whole life's a lie.

01:16:27.684 --> 01:16:32.386
Listen, you are the product
of a fine and great love

01:16:32.388 --> 01:16:33.821
with your mama and me.

01:16:33.823 --> 01:16:37.325
Just like David, huh?
Your shining star?

01:16:37.327 --> 01:16:41.028
Alright, listen.
David was special.

01:16:41.030 --> 01:16:44.365
Special. He was a drug addict!

01:16:44.367 --> 01:16:46.300
What the fuck are you
talking about, son?

01:16:46.302 --> 01:16:50.771
He was sick, just like you.

01:16:52.507 --> 01:16:55.876
<i>I was hiding in the gallery
after the show was over.</i>

01:16:58.146 --> 01:17:01.582
<i>David waited for
Travers to show up.</i>

01:17:03.752 --> 01:17:07.388
<i>Jesus Christ,
you scared the shit out of me.</i>

01:17:07.390 --> 01:17:11.125
<i>They started to argue.
David was a mess.</i>

01:17:11.127 --> 01:17:13.394
- Nice.
- - What the fuck?

01:17:19.835 --> 01:17:21.302
<i>After Travers left,</i>

01:17:21.304 --> 01:17:22.970
<i>it gave me the
perfect opportunity</i>

01:17:22.972 --> 01:17:25.740
<i>to do what
I've always wanted to do.</i>

01:17:28.310 --> 01:17:29.744
What?

01:17:34.082 --> 01:17:37.318
You killed him, you little shit!

01:17:37.320 --> 01:17:39.787
Yes, his best performance.

01:17:39.789 --> 01:17:42.056
Squirming at the end of a rope.

01:17:42.058 --> 01:17:44.525
I should show you sometime.

01:17:44.527 --> 01:17:46.927
Got the drive here in my pocket.
You want to plug it in?

01:17:46.929 --> 01:17:48.629
You son of a bitch!

01:17:55.003 --> 01:17:57.638
- You little bastard!
- You're a bastard!

01:18:01.643 --> 01:18:03.344
Austin!

01:18:45.587 --> 01:18:48.823
<i>How long have
you been drawing like this?</i>

01:18:48.825 --> 01:18:51.625
Since I was like five, I guess.

01:18:52.861 --> 01:18:55.296
Well, I love art.

01:18:55.997 --> 01:18:57.231
Where are you from?

01:18:57.233 --> 01:19:01.435
- The coast, you?
- Outside of Jackson.

01:19:01.437 --> 01:19:04.739
But my parents died,
so I came here.

01:19:04.741 --> 01:19:06.774
I'm sorry.

01:19:07.642 --> 01:19:10.845
What about you?

01:19:10.847 --> 01:19:14.482
Um, my family thought
it would be best.

01:19:15.917 --> 01:19:19.253
Well, you'll be alright,
you'll see.

01:19:22.090 --> 01:19:25.025
- Can I see more?
- Yeah.

01:19:25.027 --> 01:19:26.393
Cool.

01:19:49.551 --> 01:19:51.552
I grew up here.

01:19:52.420 --> 01:19:55.222
<i>That's why I keep coming back.</i>

01:20:00.195 --> 01:20:04.131
Hey... come on.

01:20:16.211 --> 01:20:17.878
You okay?

01:20:19.214 --> 01:20:21.382
I will be.
