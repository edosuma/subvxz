Mr. President, please accept
this gift

03:35.936 --> 03:37.669
on behalf of the Chinese people.

03:37.704 --> 03:39.304
Thanks, Ching-chong.

03:40.505 --> 03:42.871
There are very important
instructions

03:42.941 --> 03:44.374
regarding its care and feeding.

03:44.443 --> 03:46.536
We once gave a Mogwai to
American teenager,

03:46.611 --> 03:48.977
and the results were
catastrophic.

03:49.047 --> 03:50.674
But surely the leader of the
free...

03:50.749 --> 03:51.647
Yeah, all right, then.

03:51.717 --> 03:52.547
Howdy, little critter!

03:52.617 --> 03:53.914
Some people call him a
gremlin.

03:53.985 --> 03:54.952
Well, the name of this

03:55.020 --> 03:57.011
grumblin's gonna be Froot Loop.

03:58.490 --> 03:59.320
Ooh!

03:59.391 --> 04:00.255
Ha ha ha!
I'm gonna get you!

04:00.325 --> 04:01.155
Ha ha ha!

04:01.226 --> 04:02.693
I'm gonna smoke you out.

04:02.761 --> 04:05.025
Don't tell nobody we're
eating this.

04:05.097 --> 04:06.325
Hmm...

04:06.398 --> 04:07.763
Who wants to step up to the
"Qbert" table

04:07.833 --> 04:09.300
and have their furry butt
kicked?

04:12.270 --> 04:15.103
Oh, sweet, baby Jesus
how did this happen?!

04:15.173 --> 04:16.003
Ow! My heart!

04:16.074 --> 04:17.939
Ah, go get 'em, Cheney.

04:21.146 --> 04:26.049
Aah! Aah! Aah! Aah! Aah!

04:26.118 --> 04:27.847
Aaah!

04:30.088 --> 04:31.453
Aw, dang it!

04:31.523 --> 04:33.115
Who says they get to have all
the fun, right, Froot Loop?

04:34.760 --> 04:39.663
Yahoo!

04:39.731 --> 04:40.595
Uh...

04:40.665 --> 04:43.099
Them grumblins did it.

04:43.168 --> 04:44.965
Oopsy!
I lost!

04:45.036 --> 04:46.867
Take it off, Jenna, you
stupid whore!

04:46.938 --> 04:47.768
Shut up!

04:47.839 --> 04:49.101
I wanted to lose anyway!

04:49.174 --> 04:50.641
Look at my boobs!

04:54.312 --> 04:55.472
But we're related.

04:55.547 --> 04:56.377
Identical!

05:00.719 --> 05:04.155
Hey, they're having a
pants-off dance off.

05:04.222 --> 05:06.213
Come on, Froot Loop!

05:10.729 --> 05:12.890
Mr. President,
it's armageddon!

05:12.964 --> 05:13.988
I love that movie.

05:14.065 --> 05:15.464
No!
The world is doomed!

05:15.534 --> 05:16.762
It's a nuclear holocaust!

05:16.835 --> 05:20.362
So if I pissed on a spark plug,
would it do any good?

05:22.741 --> 05:24.766
Oh, George,
I'm so hungry.

05:24.843 --> 05:25.969
Oh, don't worry, honey.

05:26.044 --> 05:27.204
We'll just eat Froot Loop.

05:28.380 --> 05:30.075
Oh, Froot Loop,
I'm just kidding.

05:30.148 --> 05:32.616
We'll eat Cheney.

05:34.786 --> 05:35.844
Help!

05:35.921 --> 05:39.914
I've fallen,
and I can't get up!

05:39.991 --> 05:41.219
I said I've fallen...

05:41.293 --> 05:42.419
Medicalert at your service!

05:42.494 --> 05:43.722
Oh, thank goodness.

05:43.795 --> 05:46.628
You see, I've fallen,
and I can't get...

05:46.698 --> 05:48.222
uh...

05:48.300 --> 05:49.631
Mister?
Sir?

05:49.701 --> 05:51.726
My things are...

05:51.803 --> 05:53.464
what are you doi...

05:53.605 --> 05:56.975
Over the years, J.C. Has lost
a lot of girlfriends.

05:57.010 --> 06:00.345
You know, I think it's wrong
for anybody to be stoned.

06:00.380 --> 06:01.573
What a downer.

06:01.646 --> 06:04.342
But there's one thing he
never lost.

06:04.416 --> 06:05.348
Jesus Christ!

06:05.417 --> 06:06.406
Are you a virgin?

06:06.485 --> 06:09.215
Oh, you are hilarious.

06:09.287 --> 06:10.720
Who wants more of my blood?

06:10.789 --> 06:13.724
How can you go 33 years and
not have sex?

06:13.792 --> 06:16.226
Dude, my dad is always
watching.

06:16.294 --> 06:18.592
We got to help the man,
highlight his attributes,

06:18.663 --> 06:20.460
get rid of that pelt
on his chest.

06:20.532 --> 06:23.433
Ohh! Jim Caviezel!

06:23.502 --> 06:24.867
Let's hang on to that.

06:24.936 --> 06:27.234
You got to go somewhere where
there's lots of girls.

06:27.305 --> 06:30.570
This summer comes a film that
will touch you...

06:30.642 --> 06:32.007
Hi, I'm Mary.

06:32.077 --> 06:33.271
I've got healing hands.

06:33.345 --> 06:34.437
Oh, yeah?
So do I.

06:34.513 --> 06:37.004
...like you've never been
touched before.

06:37.082 --> 06:41.018
Ooh, looks like you're ready
for a second coming.

06:44.990 --> 06:46.514
Toss a ball and put me to
death.

06:46.591 --> 06:48.684
It's something that I want and
something you want to do.

06:48.760 --> 06:51.126
Looking for somebody with a good
arm to put me in the grave.

06:51.196 --> 06:52.925
Three balls just to put me in...

06:52.998 --> 06:53.965
yeah, let the boy do it!

06:54.032 --> 06:55.363
No, no, no, no!
Aw, damn it.

06:55.433 --> 06:56.331
What about you, sir?

06:56.401 --> 06:57.629
What about you, miss?

06:57.702 --> 07:00.805
So, remember, kids, be
careful when using matches.

07:00.840 --> 07:02.007
Smokey?

07:02.042 --> 07:03.139
Yeah, kid?

07:03.174 --> 07:04.342
How did you get your name?

07:04.377 --> 07:06.071
Well...

07:06.144 --> 07:08.476
Smokey, you always got the
best weed!

07:08.547 --> 07:10.071
Hello, little paw.

07:10.148 --> 07:11.479
I see you.

07:11.550 --> 07:12.915
Hello-o-o.

07:12.984 --> 07:13.848
There you are!

07:13.919 --> 07:15.216
We finally got you, Smokey!

07:15.287 --> 07:16.754
Downer patrol.

07:16.821 --> 07:18.254
Don't take me now.

07:18.323 --> 07:21.258
I just put a turkey in the oven.

07:21.326 --> 07:22.759
Turkey... what?

07:22.827 --> 07:24.089
You don't have any...

07:24.162 --> 07:25.356
My baby!

07:26.431 --> 07:29.025
7 million hours of community
service!

07:29.100 --> 07:31.796
Only you can prevent forest
fires.

07:34.039 --> 07:36.769
Got my name in better times,
kid.

07:36.841 --> 07:38.809
Much better times.

07:38.977 --> 07:40.243
Greetings, heroes!

princess Pam Anderson!

superhero news

07:48.653 --> 07:50.143

Captain America

07:52.424 --> 07:54.654
killed 10,000 nazis with his
bare hands.

07:54.726 --> 07:55.852

07:55.927 --> 07:58.225

08:12.010 --> 08:12.999
Pain and suffering?

Try watching
the movie "Catwoman."

08:14.713 --> 08:15.839
Zing!

08:15.914 --> 08:18.314
Galactic Historian
"The Watcher" was arrested

08:18.383 --> 08:21.750
Wednesday after his eyes bit off
a check his butt couldn't cash.

08:21.820 --> 08:22.878
But I'm the watcher.

08:22.954 --> 08:23.921
I was just watching.

08:23.989 --> 08:25.388
You're a big-headed pervert!

08:25.457 --> 08:27.755
Say, Stan, have you heard of
Paris Hilton?

08:27.826 --> 08:30.192
Say, Pam, ever hung from a
ceiling fan while

08:30.261 --> 08:32.889
your partner sat
on a paint mixer?

08:32.964 --> 08:34.727
The hard-partying celebutante

08:34.799 --> 08:37.461
has found love with the
unlikeliest of partners,

08:37.534 --> 08:39.662
Superman's evil opposite,
Bizarro.

08:54.619 --> 08:56.109
Uh... he's off-card again.

08:56.187 --> 08:57.211
Should I...

08:57.288 --> 08:59.222
After a long career of abject
failure

08:59.290 --> 09:01.952
as the Justice League's
most impotent member,

09:02.027 --> 09:03.790
Aquaman finally has a new
career.

09:03.862 --> 09:04.851
Oh, no!

09:04.929 --> 09:06.487
I've trapped my foot
in some seaweed!

09:06.564 --> 09:08.794
Help me,
my aquatic comrades!

09:11.236 --> 09:12.396
Now!

09:13.571 --> 09:15.596
As a whaling industry
consultant,

09:15.674 --> 09:17.835
Aquaman's new job nets him a
six-figure income,

09:17.909 --> 09:20.207
full benefits, and all the whale
he can eat.

09:20.278 --> 09:22.838
And now a word from our super
sponsors.

09:22.914 --> 09:24.472
Oh, I'm so embarrassed.

09:24.549 --> 09:25.481
I want a divorce.

09:25.550 --> 09:27.541
Did somebody say flaccid?

09:27.619 --> 09:28.517
Hourman!

09:28.586 --> 09:30.918
I was just plain old
Rex Tyler

09:30.989 --> 09:33.014
until I discovered a pill that
gave me

09:33.091 --> 09:35.457
superhuman abilities for one
full hour.

09:35.527 --> 09:36.994
Now, thanks to Rigidol,

09:37.062 --> 09:39.496
you can punch out erectile
dysfunction

09:39.564 --> 09:42.124
and become an Hourman
just like me!

09:42.200 --> 09:43.030
Whoa!

09:43.101 --> 09:44.398
Oh, God!

09:44.469 --> 09:46.528
You're my Hourman,
baby!

09:46.604 --> 09:48.162
Yes! Yes!

09:48.239 --> 09:49.069
Yes!

09:49.140 --> 09:50.004
Oh, baby!

09:50.075 --> 09:51.508
Merciful heavens!

09:51.576 --> 09:53.840
Oh, baby, that's it!

09:53.912 --> 09:55.573
Oh! Oh! Ohh!

09:55.647 --> 09:57.410
If you become Four-hour man,
see a doctor.

09:57.482 --> 09:59.074
What's the latest superhero
gossip?

09:59.150 --> 10:01.141
I ask the questions here,
Boobinator.

10:01.219 --> 10:03.881
So, what's the latest
superhero gossip?

10:04.956 --> 10:06.856
Paparazzi nabbed Spider-man
emerging

10:06.925 --> 10:12.090
from the home of
Miss May Parker, age 77.

10:12.163 --> 10:14.654
Is it a "May"- December
romance?

10:14.733 --> 10:16.291
A marriage of convenience?

10:16.367 --> 10:18.631
One spidey supervillain had a
different take.

10:18.703 --> 10:20.330
Take that, Spider-man!

10:20.405 --> 10:21.667
And that!

10:21.740 --> 10:23.765
I told you, I'm not that
horrible Spider-man!

10:23.842 --> 10:25.867
I'm a widow on fixed income!

10:25.944 --> 10:28.071
I read the tabloids,
Spider-man!

10:28.146 --> 10:29.170
I know who you are!

10:29.247 --> 10:31.181
"Oh! Ho ho ho!

10:31.249 --> 10:33.183
My poor old broken hip!"

10:33.251 --> 10:34.309
"Ha ha ha!

10:34.385 --> 10:35.818
I'll get you now!"

10:35.887 --> 10:37.115
"Okay, show's over.

10:37.188 --> 10:39.452
Now let me show you my kung-fu
grope."

10:39.524 --> 10:42.254
"Get off me, you creepy
comic-book guy!"

10:43.628 --> 10:45.493
Stan, honey,
dinner's getting cold!

10:45.563 --> 10:46.393
Zounds!

10:46.464 --> 10:47.294
I'm caught!

10:47.365 --> 10:49.230
But they'll never take me alive.

10:49.300 --> 10:52.736
Excelsior!

10:54.205 --> 10:58.273
Stan!

10:58.343 --> 11:00.573
# Ba-bawk bawk bawk #
# Ba-bawk bawk bawk #

11:00.645 --> 11:02.704
# Ba-bawk bawk bawk-a-wawk wawk
bawk bawk #

11:02.781 --> 11:04.840
# Ba-bawk bawk bawk #
# Ba-bawk bawk bawk #

11:04.916 --> 11:07.009
# Ba-bawk bawk bawk-a-wawk wawk

11:07.085 --> 11:09.144
# Ba-bawk bawk bawk #

# Ba-bawk bawk bawk-a-wawk wawk

11:11.422 --> 11:13.413
Ba-gawk!
Bawk.

11:15.093 --> 11:17.118
Stan, who is The Watcher?

11:17.195 --> 11:19.925
The Watcher sits on the moon
and watches things,

11:19.998 --> 11:22.967
just like the Punisher punishes
things, and the Shocker...

11:23.034 --> 11:23.864
Moving on!
