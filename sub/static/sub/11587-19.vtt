RED MEANS THAT YOU'RE TAKEN,
YELLOW IS MAYBE,

01:54.848 --> 01:57.251
AND GREEN IS D.T.F.

01:57.285 --> 01:58.719

- A LITTLE SLOPPY'S OKAY,
BUT DON'T PASS OUT ON ME.

03:52.333 --> 03:54.535
- YOU'RE FUNNY.

03:54.568 --> 03:57.305
[girl crying]

03:57.338 --> 03:59.440

04:07.615 --> 04:11.285
LINDSAY,
GET DOWN FROM THERE!

04:11.319 --> 04:14.588
- WHICH WAY IS DOWN?

04:17.958 --> 04:20.561
- LINDSAY?
LINDSAY, PLEASE. OKAY?

04:20.594 --> 04:24.332
JUST COME DOWN AND TALK.

05:14.782 --> 05:15.048
.

05:15.082 --> 05:15.516
- HI, I'M LEO BARTH,

05:17.518 --> 05:19.019
CAMPUS SECURITY DIRECTOR.
HOW CAN I HELP YOU?

05:19.052 --> 05:21.021
- WE'RE HERE TO SPEAK
WITH LINDSAY BENNETT.

05:21.054 --> 05:22.656
- I'LL SAVE YOU THE PAPERWORK.
IT'S HELL WEEK FOR THE FRATS.

05:22.690 --> 05:23.924
SHE WAS DRUNK,
WALKING ON THE ROOF LEDGE.

05:23.957 --> 05:25.092
GOOD SAMARITAN GRABBED HER.

05:25.125 --> 05:26.627
BUT SHE'S FINE NOW.

05:26.660 --> 05:29.029
- WELL, WE GOT THE CALL,
SO WE HAVE TO FOLLOW UP.

05:29.062 --> 05:31.932
- NOW? SHE'S STILL PRETTY
STOONAD.

05:31.965 --> 05:33.734
- DETECTIVES,
I'M EILEEN BENNETT,

05:33.767 --> 05:36.404
LINDSAY'S MOTHER.
I CALLED.

05:36.437 --> 05:38.606
I THINK SHE HAS BEEN RAPED.

05:38.639 --> 05:40.741
- MA'AM, IT'S A CAMPUS
SECURITY MATTER.

05:40.774 --> 05:43.411
- I WANT HER TO TALK
TO REAL POLICE.

05:43.444 --> 05:47.014
- IS SHE LUCID NOW?
- YES. ABSOLUTELY.

05:47.047 --> 05:48.582
- WE'LL KEEP YOU
IN THE LOOP, LEO.

05:48.616 --> 05:51.452
- LINDSAY CALLED
AT 2:00 IN THE MORNING

05:51.485 --> 05:54.722
IN HYSTERICS, CRYING
THAT SHE WANTED TO COME HOME.

05:54.755 --> 05:56.123
- YOU SAID SHE WAS RAPED?

05:56.156 --> 05:58.158
- AT A FRATERNITY.

05:58.191 --> 06:02.530
SHE SAID SHE HAD SEX,
AND SHE DIDN'T WANT TO.

06:02.563 --> 06:05.533
LINDSAY'S SHY,
HOME-SCHOOLED.

06:05.566 --> 06:08.536
I SHOULD HAVE KNOWN
THAT SHE WASN'T READY.

06:08.569 --> 06:10.771
- FOR BOYS?

06:10.804 --> 06:14.575
- FOR PLEDGE PARTIES,
FOR THE CITY,

06:14.608 --> 06:16.910
FOR DRINKING.

06:16.944 --> 06:19.680
I KNEW SOMETHING TERRIBLE
WOULD HAPPEN TO HER.

06:19.713 --> 06:23.751
- COME ON.

06:23.784 --> 06:25.619
- MY MOM CALLED THE POLICE?

06:25.653 --> 06:28.622
I DON'T EVEN REMEMBER
WHAT I TOLD HER.

06:28.656 --> 06:31.992
- CAN YOU TELL ME
WHAT YOU DO REMEMBER?

06:32.025 --> 06:34.061
YOU WERE AT TAU OMEGA.

06:34.094 --> 06:38.432
- I WAS...
TALKING TO THIS GUY,

06:38.466 --> 06:41.034
TRAVIS, IN HIS ROOM.

06:41.068 --> 06:45.573
THE DOOR WAS OPEN.

06:45.606 --> 06:48.609
HE--HE ASKED TO KISS ME.

06:48.642 --> 06:52.045
- OKAY.
THEN WHAT HAPPENED?

06:52.079 --> 06:56.650
- HE STARTED TO MOVE
TOO FAST.

06:56.684 --> 06:58.952
I--I ASKED HIM
TO SLOW DOWN.

06:58.986 --> 07:03.724
I'D NEVER GONE
ALL THE WAY BEFORE.

07:03.757 --> 07:04.858
- YOU'RE A VIRGIN?

07:04.892 --> 07:06.727
OKAY.

07:06.760 --> 07:09.730
DID YOU EVER SAY "NO"
OR STOP"?

07:09.763 --> 07:11.965
- I SAID STOP, AND THEN
TWO OTHER GUYS CAME IN.

07:11.999 --> 07:16.570
AFTER THAT, IT--
IT ALL HAPPENED SO QUICKLY.

07:16.604 --> 07:19.707
THEY WERE--THEY WERE ALL
ON TOP OF ME.

07:19.740 --> 07:21.709
- DID YOU KNOW
THE OTHER TWO BOYS?

07:23.644 --> 07:26.113
- THEY'RE IN THE FRAT,
I THINK.

07:26.146 --> 07:30.551
CARTER AND...WESLEY.

07:30.584 --> 07:32.720
I DIDN'T GET A GOOD LOOK
AT THEIR FACES.

07:32.753 --> 07:35.589
- OKAY.

07:35.623 --> 07:37.491
OKAY.
AND THEN WHAT HAPPENED?

07:37.525 --> 07:40.127
- I TRI--
I TRIED TO SAY NO,

07:40.160 --> 07:47.668
BUT TRAVIS...
FORCED MY MOUTH OPEN...

07:47.701 --> 07:51.705
AND THE OTHER TWO...

07:51.739 --> 07:58.111
ONE IN FRONT...
ONE IN--IN BACK.

07:58.145 --> 08:01.715
AND IT HURT SO MUCH.

08:01.749 --> 08:03.617
I COULD HEAR THEM LAUGHING...

08:03.651 --> 08:06.620
HIGH-FIVING EACH OTHER.

08:06.654 --> 08:09.289
BUT PLEASE, DON'T TELL MY MOM
IT WAS THREE OF THEM.

08:09.322 --> 08:13.193
- OKAY, SWEETIE,
IT'S OVER NOW. OKAY?

08:13.226 --> 08:17.665
I AM GONNA ASK YOU
TO GET A RAPE KIT DONE. OKAY?

08:17.698 --> 08:19.900
THEN YOU CAN SHOWER
AND GET CLEANED UP.

08:19.933 --> 08:21.935
- I ALREADY SHOWERED.

08:21.969 --> 08:24.271
CAMPUS SECURITY TOLD THE NURSE
IT WAS OKAY.

08:24.304 --> 08:27.641
- DID HE KNOW THAT
YOU'D BEEN RAPED?

08:27.675 --> 08:30.878
- HE DIDN'T ASK.
I HAD MARKER ON MY BODY.

08:30.911 --> 08:33.113
I WANTED TO GET IT OFF.
- THOSE BOYS DREW ON YOU?

08:33.146 --> 08:34.915
- NO, NO, IT'S PART
OF HELL WEEK.

08:34.948 --> 08:37.651
THE SISTERS CIRCLE
YOUR BODY FAT.

08:37.685 --> 08:43.691
BUT IF I MAKE TROUBLE,
THEY WON'T LET ME PLEDGE.

08:46.126 --> 08:48.195
- YOU SAID SHE'S SHELTERED.

08:48.228 --> 08:49.863
IS THAT OUT OF CHARACTER?

08:49.897 --> 08:52.265
- SHE HAD A LOT
OF WALKING DEAD SHOTS.

08:52.299 --> 08:54.668
AND SHE HAD
A PLEDGE CHALLENGE.

08:54.702 --> 08:57.671
SHE HAD TO GET A PIC
OF TRAVIS' THING.

08:57.705 --> 09:01.108
- IT IS HELL WEEK.
SOME GIRLS GET TOO DRUNK.

09:01.141 --> 09:03.677
- SO YOU SENT A DRUNK GIRL
TO ASK A FRAT GUY

09:03.711 --> 09:05.646
TO PULL HIS PANTS DOWN?

09:05.679 --> 09:07.681
- I DID IT WHEN I WAS
A PLEDGE.

09:07.715 --> 09:09.850
NO ONE'S FORCED TO DO ANYTHING
THEY'RE UNCOMFORTABLE WITH.

09:09.883 --> 09:11.685
- THAT'S HOW YOU FELT.

09:11.719 --> 09:14.588
ARE YOU SURE THAT LINDSAY FELT
THE SAME WAY?

09:14.622 --> 09:15.956
- IF LINDSAY'S SAYING
SOMETHING HAPPENED,

09:15.989 --> 09:18.659
THEN MAYBE IT'S BECAUSE
SHE'S EMBARRASSED

09:18.692 --> 09:21.595
THAT SHE GOT SLUTTY.

09:21.629 --> 09:23.163
- LINDSAY BENNETT, FRESHMAN.
SHE'S HOME-SCHOOLED.

09:23.196 --> 09:25.365
FROM UPSTATE.
A VIRGIN.

09:25.398 --> 09:27.768
SHE'S HAZED BY HER SORORITY.
SHE DRINKS TOO MUCH,

09:27.801 --> 09:30.871
AND SHE'S GANG-RAPED
BY THREE TAU OMEGA BROTHERS.

09:30.904 --> 09:32.239
- THAT FRAT AGAIN.

09:32.272 --> 09:34.007
ANYBODY AT THE PARTY
CONFIRM HER STORY?

09:34.041 --> 09:36.744
- YEAH. HER SORORITY SISTERS
ADMIT THAT SHE WAS ASSIGNED

09:36.777 --> 09:39.680
TO GET A PHOTO
OF TRAVIS' PACKAGE.

09:39.713 --> 09:42.015
AND THEY'RE SLUT-SHAMING HER
FOR ANYTHING ELSE THAT HAPPENED.

09:42.049 --> 09:45.085
- GREAT. MEAN GIRLS.
AND WHAT ABOUT TRAVIS.

09:45.118 --> 09:47.788
- B.M.O.C. RHODES SCHOLAR.
HEADED TO OXFORD.

09:47.821 --> 09:50.157
- SO SHE SAYS ONCE
SHE GETS HER TROPHY PIC,

09:50.190 --> 09:52.225
HE PUTS THE MOVES ON HER,
GETS AGGRESSIVE.

09:52.259 --> 09:54.695
AND THEN TWO OTHER BROTHERS
COME IN OUT OF NOWHERE,

09:54.728 --> 09:56.029
AND SHE'S PRETTY SURE
ON THE I.D.

09:56.063 --> 09:58.031
IT'S WESLEY GRIMES
AND CARTER PRESSMAN.

09:58.065 --> 10:00.668
- "PRETTY SURE"?
JUST HOW DRUNK WAS SHE?

10:00.701 --> 10:02.970
- VERY. AND THE RAPE KIT'S
A MESS.

10:03.003 --> 10:04.805
THE NURSE LET HER SHOWER
BEFORE WE GOT THERE.

10:04.838 --> 10:06.907
- WHERE WAS
CAMPUS SECURITY?

10:06.940 --> 10:08.742
- DOING THEIR BEST
TO MAKE THIS GO AWAY.

10:08.776 --> 10:10.310
- WE'VE SEEN THIS BEFORE.

10:10.343 --> 10:13.346
SCHOOL CIRCLES THE WAGONS,
THE FRAT BOYS LAUGH IT OFF.

10:13.380 --> 10:17.685
NO MORE.
GO AFTER 'EM HARD.

10:20.120 --> 10:21.989
- YEAH, LINDSAY AND ME
HOOKED UP LAST NIGHT.

10:22.022 --> 10:25.025
NOT MY PROUDEST MOMENT.
NICE BODY, BUTTERFACE.

10:25.058 --> 10:27.127
THERE'S A SILVER LINING.

10:27.160 --> 10:28.896
GIRLS LIKE THAT
CAN GET PRETTY KINKY.

10:28.929 --> 10:30.731
- SHE CLAIMS YOU FORCED HER.

10:30.764 --> 10:32.700
- MORE THE OTHER WAY AROUND.

10:32.733 --> 10:35.102
SHE CAME INTO MY ROOM,
WEARING GREEN.

10:35.135 --> 10:37.838
ASKED ME TO UNZIP FOR A PHOTO.
SHE WAS D.T.F.

10:37.871 --> 10:39.740
- WAS SHE?

10:39.773 --> 10:41.274
DID YOU DOUBLE-CHECK
WITH LINDSAY

10:41.308 --> 10:43.811
BEFORE YOU AND YOUR BUDDIES
TRIPLE-TEAMED HER?

10:43.844 --> 10:46.379
- COME ON, A WALK OF SHAME
IS ONE THING,

10:46.413 --> 10:49.182
BUT CALLING IT RAPE?

10:49.216 --> 10:50.751
- THE GIRL GOT DRUNK
AND WENT WILD.

10:50.784 --> 10:53.320
- SHE WAS SOBER ENOUGH
TO I.D. THE THREE OF YOU.

10:53.353 --> 10:55.022
YOU'RE
IN SERIOUS TROUBLE HERE.

10:55.055 --> 10:57.290
- SHE WANTED IT.
- SHE WANTED IT?

10:57.324 --> 10:59.026
YOU COULD TELL ALL THAT
WHILE SHE WAS CRYING

10:59.059 --> 11:00.761
AND SAYING NO?

11:00.794 --> 11:02.029
- YOU'RE RIGHT, MA'AM.
SHE DID SAY NO.

11:02.062 --> 11:03.430
AS IN, "NO, DON'T STOP.

11:03.463 --> 11:05.833
PLEASE DON'T STOP."

11:05.866 --> 11:08.168
- SHE GOT THREE GUYS OFF.

11:08.201 --> 11:10.871
LOOK, I'M NO PSYCH MAJOR,
BUT THESE FRESHMAN GIRLS

11:10.904 --> 11:13.707
GET WASTED AS AN EXCUSE
TO EXPERIMENT SEXUALLY.

11:13.741 --> 11:15.242
AND THE NEXT DAY,
THEY'RE ALL EMBARRASSED.

11:15.275 --> 11:17.210
- SHE'S NOT EMBARRASSED.
SHE WAS RAPED.

11:17.244 --> 11:20.013
- HOLD ON.
SHE WENT INTO TRAVIS' ROOM.

11:20.047 --> 11:22.049
SHE GOT DOWN ON ALL FOURS
ON HIS BED.

11:22.082 --> 11:23.717
- NOW, WAS THAT BEFORE
OR AFTER

11:23.751 --> 11:25.185
SHE INVITED YOU
AND YOUR BUDDY IN?

11:25.218 --> 11:28.989
- THAT WAS THE INVITATION.
DOOR WAS OPEN, MAN.

11:29.022 --> 11:32.793
- WHATEVER THAT GIRL
TOLD HER MOTHER OR THE COPS,

11:32.826 --> 11:34.094
SHE'S INTO ME.
- SHUT UP.

11:34.127 --> 11:35.462
WE'RE GONNA CONFISCATE
YOUR CELL PHONE,

11:35.495 --> 11:38.098
ALL YOUR FRAT BROTHERS' PHONES,
YOUR iPADS.

11:38.131 --> 11:41.001
- WAIT, WAIT.
WHAT'S THIS?

11:41.034 --> 11:42.502
SCROLL DOWN.

11:42.535 --> 11:45.238
SHE SENT IT THIS MORNING.
SNAPCHAT.

11:45.272 --> 11:46.306
BUT I GOT A SCREEN GRAB

11:46.339 --> 11:50.310
I GUESS AFTER LAST NIGHT,
LINDSAY WANTS SOME MORE.

11:50.343 --> 11:54.381
- YOU SENT A TOPLESS PHOTO
OF YOURSELF TO TRAVIS?

11:54.414 --> 11:58.786
- HE--HE ASKED ME TO.
HE TEXTED ME.

11:58.819 --> 12:00.754
HE SAID HE WANTED
TO HOOK UP AGAIN.

12:00.788 --> 12:02.455
IT WAS STUPID.

12:02.489 --> 12:04.825
I THOUGHT--I THOUGHT
MAYBE HE STILL LIKED ME.

12:04.858 --> 12:07.127
THE PHOTO WAS SUPPOSED TO
DISAPPEAR AFTER SEVEN SECONDS.

12:07.160 --> 12:09.429
- NOTHING DISAPPEARS
FROM THE INTERNET EVER.

12:09.462 --> 12:12.465
- I KNOW. HE POSTED IT
ON TSU-UNDERGROUND.

12:12.499 --> 12:14.067
THEY'RE CALLING ME
A SLUT--

12:14.101 --> 12:15.502
SAYING I'M SPREADING
STDs.

12:15.535 --> 12:16.970
- OKAY, OKAY.
THAT'S HORRIBLE,

12:17.004 --> 12:18.872
AND WE CAN TRY
AND MAKE THAT STOP,

12:18.906 --> 12:20.808
BUT JUST DON'T CONTACT
THOSE GUYS AGAIN.

12:20.841 --> 12:25.278
- WHAT ABOUT THEM?
THE WHOLE FRAT IS TEXTING ME.

12:25.312 --> 12:28.215
- "YOU GOTTA HAVE IT."
"WE GOT MO' FOR YOU."

12:28.248 --> 12:31.318
"HO."
"CAN YOU EVEN WALK TODAY?"

12:31.351 --> 12:32.886
- I CAN'T. I'M SORRY.
I MADE A MISTAKE.

12:32.920 --> 12:34.487
I CAN'T DO THIS.
WHAT HAPPENED LAST NIGHT,

12:34.521 --> 12:35.789
I WANTED IT.

12:35.823 --> 12:37.257
- YOU WANTED
TO LOSE YOUR VIRGINITY

12:37.290 --> 12:39.226
TO THREE BOYS AT ONCE...

12:39.259 --> 12:42.830
WHO LAUGHED AT YOU,
WHO HURT YOU?

12:42.863 --> 12:44.932
- PRESSING CHARGES IS GONNA
MAKE MATTERS WORSE.

12:44.965 --> 12:46.266
I KNOW WHAT HAPPENED
TO RENEE.

12:46.299 --> 12:47.300
- RENEE?
- YEAH.

12:47.334 --> 12:49.269
- ANOTHER STUDENT?
- YEAH.

12:49.302 --> 12:51.371
- WHAT HAPPENED TO HER?
- TRAVIS HOLMES HAPPENED TO HER.

12:51.404 --> 12:52.973
- WHEN?
- LAST YEAR.

12:53.006 --> 12:55.542
EVERYBODY TALKS ABOUT HER,
HOW SHE CRIED RAPE.

12:55.575 --> 12:58.211
THE SCHOOL DIDN'T BELIEVE HER.
SHE WENT CRAZY.

12:58.245 --> 13:00.013
THEY LOCKED HER UP
IN A PSYCH WARD.

13:00.047 --> 13:02.449
- OKAY.

13:02.482 --> 13:06.053
- THE PHOTO THAT LINDSAY
SNAPCHATTED WENT VIRAL AT TSU.

13:06.086 --> 13:07.487
SHE'S "SLUT OF THE WEEK."

13:07.520 --> 13:09.489
- OKAY.
WELL, THERE GOES OUR CASE.

13:09.522 --> 13:12.392
- DOESN'T MATTER.
SHE'S BACKING OFF HER COMPLAINT.

13:12.425 --> 13:14.361
- I DON'T BLAME HER.

13:14.394 --> 13:16.363
THE FRAT GUYS ALSO POSTED
SHOTS OF LINDSAY

13:16.396 --> 13:18.065
FLIRTING WITH TRAVIS
AT THE PARTY.

13:18.098 --> 13:19.900
- SHE'S CLEARLY DRUNK.
- WELL, THAT MAY BE,

13:19.933 --> 13:21.468
BUT THESE PHOTOS
DON'T HELP HER STORY.

13:21.501 --> 13:23.904
- SO BOYS WILL BE BOYS,
AND GIRLS GET RAPED?

13:23.937 --> 13:25.839
- LINDSAY'S SCARED.

13:25.873 --> 13:28.208
OKAY, SHE TOLD ME THAT
THERE WAS THIS GIRL LAST YEAR,

13:28.241 --> 13:31.979
RENEE, WHO ALLEGED RAPE,
AND NOBODY BELIEVED HER.

13:32.012 --> 13:33.881
ACCORDING TO SCHOOL RUMOR,

13:33.914 --> 13:36.116
THE GIRL HAS BEEN
INSTITUTIONALIZED.

13:36.149 --> 13:41.021
- ALL RIGHT, SO WHAT DO WE KNOW
ABOUT THIS RENEE?

13:41.054 --> 13:43.490
- I GOT SOMETHING.

13:43.523 --> 13:45.893
FROM LAST SPRING.

13:45.926 --> 13:50.263
- WE GOT A FIRST NAME
AND A PHOTO--LET'S FIND HER.

13:52.900 --> 13:54.567
- RENEE CLARK.

13:54.601 --> 13:56.569
SHE COMMITTED HERSELF
IN JANUARY.

13:56.603 --> 13:58.605
- DETECTIVES,
YOU'RE HERE FOR RENEE.

13:58.638 --> 14:00.240
I'M SORRY, I JUST GOT
YOUR MESSAGE.

14:00.273 --> 14:01.641
TODAY'S NOT A GOOD DAY.

14:01.674 --> 14:03.076
- WE REALLY NEED
TO SPEAK WITH HER.

14:03.110 --> 14:04.144
SHE'S A POTENTIAL WITNESS

14:04.177 --> 14:05.445
IN A RAPE INVESTIGATION.

14:05.478 --> 14:08.949
- NOT NOW.

14:08.982 --> 14:11.384
SHE'S ALREADY BEEN
SEDATED.

14:11.418 --> 14:13.520
TODAY'S HER FIRST ROUND
OF E.C.T.

14:13.553 --> 14:15.455
- ELECTROSHOCK TREATMENT?

14:15.488 --> 14:17.190
WON'T THAT AFFECT
HER MEMORY?

14:17.224 --> 14:18.926
- IT'S A POSSIBILITY.
- WELL, THEN, STOP IT, NOW.

14:18.959 --> 14:20.593
- WELL, THAT'S NOT UP TO ME.

14:20.627 --> 14:23.096
RENEE ASKED
FOR THIS THERAPY.

14:23.130 --> 14:26.599
IT'S HER CHOICE.

14:26.633 --> 14:29.569
- CHARGE TO 800 MILLIAMPS.

14:29.602 --> 14:31.371
- CHARGING.

14:31.404 --> 14:32.605
- CLEAR.
[electricity buzzes]

14:42.649 --> 14:42.782
.

14:42.815 --> 14:43.616
- RENEE'S COME OUT
OF THE SEDATIVE NOW.

14:45.652 --> 14:46.653
HER SHORT-TERM RECALL
WILL BE FUZZY,

14:46.686 --> 14:48.155
BUT ONE ROUND OF TREATMENT

14:48.188 --> 14:49.656
SHOULDN'T AFFECT
LONG-TERM MEMORY.

14:49.689 --> 14:51.158
IS THIS ABOUT HER ASSAULT?

14:51.191 --> 14:53.560
- HERS AND ANOTHER STUDENT'S.

14:53.593 --> 14:55.128
- I KNOW YOU HAVE
A JOB TO DO,

14:55.162 --> 14:56.629
BUT SHE'S BEEN
IN A SEVERE DEPRESSION.

14:56.663 --> 14:59.532
SHE OPTED FOR E.C.T.
TO PUT THE ASSAULT BEHIND HER.

14:59.566 --> 15:02.302
- IN MY EXPERIENCE,
A SURVIVOR CAN HEAL

15:02.335 --> 15:04.972
MUCH MORE QUICKLY
IF THEY'RE LISTENED TO.

15:05.005 --> 15:06.673
- SHE'S BEEN HEARD HERE,

15:06.706 --> 15:08.541
BUT THE WAY THE SCHOOL
HANDLED THE ASSAULT,

15:08.575 --> 15:10.210
IT CONTINUALLY
RE-TRAUMATIZED HER.

15:10.243 --> 15:12.079
- DOES SHE HAVE
A SUPPORT SYSTEM IN PLACE?

15:12.112 --> 15:13.546
I MEAN FAMILY, FRIENDS?

15:13.580 --> 15:16.083
- SHE'S BEEN HERE TEN WEEKS.
NO VISITORS.

15:16.116 --> 15:18.485
FATHER'S GONE,
MOTHER'S IN REHAB.

15:18.518 --> 15:19.686
- WELL, WE DON'T WANT
TO TRIGGER HER,

15:19.719 --> 15:22.389
BUT HER ASSAILANT
MAY HAVE RAPED AGAIN.

15:22.422 --> 15:24.391
- I UNDERSTAND.

15:24.424 --> 15:26.359
BUT RENEE'S LEERY
OF AUTHORITY.

15:26.393 --> 15:30.497
LET ME TALK TO HER FIRST.

15:30.530 --> 15:33.433
RENEE, IF YOU FEEL TIRED
OR UPSET,

15:33.466 --> 15:35.235
LET THE DETECTIVES KNOW.

15:35.268 --> 15:37.537
THEY'VE ASSURED ME
THEY'LL BACK OFF.

15:37.570 --> 15:41.041
- I'M OKAY.
- BUZZ IF YOU NEED ME.

15:41.074 --> 15:43.643
- SHE TOLD YOU
WHY WE'RE HERE?

15:43.676 --> 15:45.445
- YEAH.
THAT SOMEONE ELSE WAS RAPED.

15:45.478 --> 15:47.214
THE POLICE NEED TO PRETEND
THEY CARE?

15:47.247 --> 15:48.715
- LOOK, WE KNOW THAT
YOU'VE BEEN THROUGH A LOT.

15:48.748 --> 15:52.685
- YOU HAVE NO IDEA.

15:52.719 --> 15:54.554
- WELL, THEN, TELL US.

15:54.587 --> 15:57.557
- I TOLD THE STORY
A DOZEN TIMES,

15:57.590 --> 15:59.726
AND NO ONE BELIEVED ME
UNTIL I ENDED UP HERE.

15:59.759 --> 16:03.096
- I'M SORRY THAT IT TOOK SO LONG
FOR US TO FIND YOU,

16:03.130 --> 16:07.267
AND I KNOW HOW HARD IT IS
TO TALK ABOUT AGAIN.

16:07.300 --> 16:09.136
BUT IF YOU GIVE US A CHANCE,
I PROMISE YOU, RENEE,

16:09.169 --> 16:10.703
IT'LL BE DIFFERENT THIS TIME.

16:10.737 --> 16:12.605
- NO, THE ONLY THING
THAT'S GONNA MAKE IT DIFFERENT

16:12.639 --> 16:16.043
IS FRYING MY BRAIN UNTIL
I CAN'T REMEMBER ANY OF IT.

16:20.713 --> 16:23.416
- THE BOY WHO ASSAULTED YOU,
TRAVIS,

16:23.450 --> 16:26.119
WE THINK HE'S THE ONE
WHO ASSAULTED THE STUDENT.

16:26.153 --> 16:28.555
- YOU KNOW WHAT I'D TELL HER?
TO SHUT UP ABOUT TRAVIS,

16:28.588 --> 16:30.157
OR THEY'LL GO AFTER HER.

16:30.190 --> 16:33.593
- THE FRATERNITY?
- THEM AND THE SCHOOL.

16:33.626 --> 16:35.628
WHEN I FILED CHARGES,
DEAN MEYERSON

16:35.662 --> 16:37.597
TRIED TO MAKE IT OUT
TO BE MY FAULT.

16:37.630 --> 16:40.433
AND WHEN I POSTED ONLINE
ABOUT WHAT A SHAM

16:40.467 --> 16:43.236
THEIR INVESTIGATION WAS,
I GOT A LETTER SAYING

16:43.270 --> 16:45.338
THAT THEY'D CHARGE ME
WITH A VIOLATION

16:45.372 --> 16:47.140
OF THE TSU HONOR CODE--

16:47.174 --> 16:52.679
THAT I WAS INTIMIDATING
MY RAPIST!

16:52.712 --> 16:55.315
THAT PLACE...

16:55.348 --> 16:58.385
NOTHING'S GONNA CHANGE THEM.

17:00.653 --> 17:03.390
- SO RENEE CLARK IS STILL SAYING
THAT SHE WAS RAPED?

17:03.423 --> 17:07.160
- MM-HMM.
- RENEE IS A TROUBLED GIRL.

17:07.194 --> 17:08.795
ISSUES WITH DRUGS,
ALCOHOL.

17:08.828 --> 17:11.798
- WAS SHE TROUBLED BEFORE SHE
WAS ASSAULTED ON YOUR CAMPUS?

17:11.831 --> 17:15.602
- ACTUALLY, YES.
SHE COMES FROM A BROKEN HOME.

17:15.635 --> 17:19.072
SHE OVERCOMPENSATED BY BEING
A GOOD ENOUGH STUDENT

17:19.106 --> 17:21.308
TO GET A SCHOLARSHIP,
BUT...

17:21.341 --> 17:23.510
SHE'S HAD A HARD TIME
FITTING IN.

17:23.543 --> 17:25.212
WHAT WE CALL A MISMATCH.

17:25.245 --> 17:28.481
- WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT
MAKING THE DEAN'S LIST.

17:28.515 --> 17:30.517
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT
THE SECOND GIRL

17:30.550 --> 17:32.652
THAT SAID SHE WAS RAPED
AT THE SAME FRATERNITY

17:32.685 --> 17:35.855
BY THE SAME STUDENT...
OKAY?

17:35.888 --> 17:39.426
WE'D JUST LIKE TO SEE YOUR FILES
ON THE INCIDENT.

17:39.459 --> 17:41.728
- THEY'RE SEALED.

17:41.761 --> 17:44.397
RENEE CLARK MADE,
THEN WITHDREW,

17:44.431 --> 17:47.367
UNSUPPORTABLE ACCUSATIONS
AGAINST A FELLOW STUDENT.

17:47.400 --> 17:49.669
- MM-HMM.
- I FEEL SORRY FOR HER.

17:49.702 --> 17:53.373
BUT SHORT OF DESTROYING
SOMEONE ELSE'S REPUTATION,

17:53.406 --> 17:56.376
WE'VE DONE EVERYTHING WE CAN
TO HELP HER.

17:56.409 --> 17:57.744
- "UNSUPPORTABLE ACCUSATIONS"?

17:57.777 --> 18:00.847
DID YOU INTERVIEW RENEE?
- I DID.

18:00.880 --> 18:03.616
AND SO DID TALIA BLAINE.
SHE'S AN EXPERIENCED COUNSELOR.

18:03.650 --> 18:07.187
THAT'S A DIRECT QUOTE
FROM HER.

18:09.422 --> 18:11.391
- RENEE BELIEVED SHE WAS RAPED.
HE DENIES IT.

18:11.424 --> 18:12.692
I WASN'T THERE.

18:12.725 --> 18:14.594
AND THESE STORIES
ARE ALWAYS COMPLICATED.

18:14.627 --> 18:17.664
DRUGS AND/OR ALCOHOL,
YOUNG, EMOTIONAL GIRLS.

18:17.697 --> 18:21.301
- AND PRIVILEGED,
AGGRESSIVE BOYS.

18:21.334 --> 18:24.204
SO THESE STORIES,
HOW MANY OF THEM TOOK PLACE

18:24.237 --> 18:26.873
AT TAU OMEGA?
- OFF THE RECORD?

18:26.906 --> 18:28.708
THE STUDENTS CALL THE FRAT
"THE RAPE FACTORY."

18:28.741 --> 18:30.410
IT'S THEIR IDEA
OF A JOKE.

18:30.443 --> 18:32.612
- AND THE SCHOOL DOESN'T
SHUT 'EM DOWN?

18:32.645 --> 18:34.781
- HOW? THEY'RE ALSO CALLED
"THE WATER WALKERS."

18:34.814 --> 18:37.150
A LOT OF LEGACIES,
SCHOLAR ATHLETES.

18:37.184 --> 18:38.785
SMART, FROM GOOD HOMES.

18:38.818 --> 18:40.853
THE DEAN DOESN'T WANT
TO DESTROY THESE BOYS' FUTURES

18:40.887 --> 18:42.555
ON A DRUNKEN ACCUSATION.

18:42.589 --> 18:43.623
- IS THAT WHY
YOU MADE RENEE FEEL

18:43.656 --> 18:45.458
THAT THE RAPE WAS HER FAULT

18:45.492 --> 18:47.460
AND WHY YOU TOLD HER
TO DROP THE CHARGES?

18:47.494 --> 18:49.396
- IS THAT WHAT SHE SAID?
I WAS PREPPING HER

18:49.429 --> 18:51.731
FOR THE QUESTIONS
SHE'D GET AT THE HEARING.

18:51.764 --> 18:53.833
"DID YOU GO TO THE FRAT?
DID YOU MAKE OUT WITH HIM?

18:53.866 --> 18:55.768
WHY DID YOU WAIT SO LONG
TO REPORT?"

18:55.802 --> 18:58.171
- I GET IT.
WE DO THE SAME THING.

18:58.205 --> 19:01.341
- I JUST WANTED HER TO KNOW
WHAT SHE'D BE GETTING INTO.

19:01.374 --> 19:05.745
SHE DECIDED ON HER OWN THAT
IT WOULD BE BEST TO MOVE ON.

19:09.849 --> 19:12.619
- I TOLD THEM LAST TIME I DON'T
WANT TO TALK ABOUT IT ANYMORE.

19:12.652 --> 19:14.654
- THEY WENT TO THE SCHOOL,
RENEE.

19:14.687 --> 19:17.290
THEY KNOW WHAT YOU TOLD THEM
IS THE TRUTH.

19:17.324 --> 19:18.658
- THE SCHOOL ADMITTED THAT?

19:18.691 --> 19:21.228
- THEY TOLD US
THEIR SIDE OF THE STORY,

19:21.261 --> 19:23.596
TRIED TO RATIONALIZE
THEIR ACTIONS.

19:23.630 --> 19:25.298
BUT WHAT THEY
PUT YOU THROUGH

19:25.332 --> 19:28.768
WOULD DRIVE ANYONE
OVER THE EDGE.

19:28.801 --> 19:30.570
- SO YOU'RE SAYING
I'M NOT CRAZY.

19:30.603 --> 19:33.706
- NO, YOU'RE NOT CRAZY.
WE WANT TO HELP YOU,

19:33.740 --> 19:36.309
AND WE WANT TRAVIS
HELD ACCOUNTABLE

19:36.343 --> 19:37.577
FOR WHAT HE'S DONE.

19:37.610 --> 19:39.246
- AND WE NEED YOUR HELP.

19:39.279 --> 19:41.748
OTHERWISE,
IN A FEW MONTHS,

19:41.781 --> 19:44.217
TRAVIS GOES OFF TO OXFORD.

19:46.853 --> 19:50.323
- OKAY.
I CAN DO THIS.

19:53.326 --> 19:57.797
- YOUR ASSAULT...
IT WAS A YEAR AGO?

20:02.702 --> 20:05.772
- RIGHT BEFORE
CHRISTMAS BREAK.

20:05.805 --> 20:08.641
ON A FRIDAY NIGHT.

20:08.675 --> 20:11.644
I RAN INTO TRAVIS
IN THE STUDENT CENTER.

20:11.678 --> 20:13.746
I KNEW HIM
FROM MY ECON CLASS.

20:13.780 --> 20:15.482
WE STARTED TALKING,

20:15.515 --> 20:17.584
THEN HE INVITED ME
TO HIS FRAT HOUSE

20:17.617 --> 20:22.689
TO WATCH
IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE.

20:22.722 --> 20:26.659
MY DORM WAS EMPTY.
I WAS LONELY.

20:26.693 --> 20:27.994
SO I WENT.

20:28.027 --> 20:30.363
- SO WHAT HAPPENED
WHEN YOU GOT THERE?

20:30.397 --> 20:34.000
HE GUT US BOTH BEERS
AND BROWNIES,

20:34.033 --> 20:36.469
AND I GUESS
THEY HAD POT IN THEM,

20:36.503 --> 20:37.804
'CAUSE I GOT DIZZY.

20:37.837 --> 20:42.742
AND WE SAT ON THE COUCH,
UNDER A BLANKET,

20:42.775 --> 20:44.377
AND NO ONE ELSE
WAS IN THE HOUSE,

20:44.411 --> 20:47.647
SO IT WAS--
IT WAS NICE AT FIRST.

20:52.419 --> 20:55.622
AND THEN HE KISSED ME.

20:55.655 --> 20:59.592
- AND THEN?

20:59.626 --> 21:02.595
AND THEN HE GOT ME,
AND HE SHOVED HIS HAND

21:02.629 --> 21:06.966
DOWN MY JEANS,
PUT A FINGER INSIDE ME.

21:06.999 --> 21:09.836
- DID YOU ASK HIM TO STOP?
- YES.

21:09.869 --> 21:12.705
I TRIED TO PUSH HIM OFF,

21:12.739 --> 21:15.908
BUT HE SLAPPED ME.

21:15.942 --> 21:19.746
HE PINNED MY ARMS
ABOVE MY HEAD...

21:19.779 --> 21:22.582
UNZIPPED HIS PANTS,
AND HE--

21:22.615 --> 21:29.789
HE TOLD ME THAT HE--
HE KNEW I WANTED IT.

21:29.822 --> 21:33.426
AND THEN HE TURNED ME OVER
AND HE RAPED ME.

21:35.462 --> 21:38.665
- AND WHAT HAPPENED
AFTER THAT, RENEE?

21:38.698 --> 21:43.570
- WHEN HE WAS FINISHED...

21:43.603 --> 21:46.939
HE TOLD ME THAT HE HAD
A FLIGHT TO CATCH.

21:46.973 --> 21:49.409
THERE WAS A TOWN CAR
WAITING.

21:49.442 --> 21:51.811
HE GAVE ME A RIDE
BACK TO MY DORM.

21:51.844 --> 21:54.381
- AND DID YOU TELL ANYBODY?

21:56.616 --> 21:59.619
- NO.

21:59.652 --> 22:01.087
THE CAMPUS
WAS MOSTLY DESERTED,

22:01.120 --> 22:06.393
AND I JUST--I STAYED IN BED
AND TRIED TO FORGET.

22:06.426 --> 22:10.497
- AND WHEN DID YOU FINALLY
REPORT IT TO THE SCHOOL?

22:10.530 --> 22:12.665
- SEPTEMBER.

22:12.699 --> 22:17.036
BUT THE HEAD OF CAMPUS SECURITY
SAID I WAITED TOO LONG.

22:17.069 --> 22:18.871
- AND THEN YOU MET
WITH DEAN MEYERSON?

22:18.905 --> 22:23.876
- AND SHE ASKED ME
ABOUT MY FAMILY AND MY GRADES,

22:23.910 --> 22:26.746
AND IF I'D HAD
ANY OTHER BAD HOOKUPS.

22:29.081 --> 22:31.418
- SO HOW DID YOU GET HERE?

22:33.520 --> 22:36.389
- I HAD A BAD NIGHT.

22:36.423 --> 22:40.627
DRINKING...
TOOK SOME SLEEPING PILLS.

22:40.660 --> 22:43.796
MY ROOMMATE
CALLED CAMPUS SECURITY.

22:46.766 --> 22:51.170
AND THEY SHOWED UP.
I STARTED SCREAMING,

22:51.203 --> 22:53.105
AND THEY, UM...

22:53.139 --> 22:54.841
THEY PUT ME
IN A STRAITJACKET

22:54.874 --> 22:58.911
IN FRONT OF EVERYONE.

22:58.945 --> 23:02.749
SAID IF I DIDN'T ADMIT MYSELF,
THEY'D COMMIT ME.

23:04.984 --> 23:07.654
- I'M SO SORRY.

23:23.035 --> 23:23.169
.

23:23.202 --> 23:24.170
- THESE THREE GUYS, WE NEED
TO BRING 'EM IN NOW.

23:25.605 --> 23:26.639
- MM-HMM, AND THEN WHAT?

23:26.673 --> 23:27.974
NO RAPE KITS, NO WITNESSES.

23:28.007 --> 23:28.975
LINDSAY WON'T PRESS CHARGES.

23:29.008 --> 23:29.976
RENEE IS LOCKED UP

23:30.009 --> 23:31.210
IN LAGUARDIA PSYCHIATRIC.

23:31.243 --> 23:33.012
- ALL RIGHT, COUNSELOR,
WE GET IT.

23:33.045 --> 23:36.148
- SO THE RAPE FACTORY JUST KEEPS
CHURNING OUT VICTIMS.

23:36.182 --> 23:37.884
- RAPE FACTORY?
- THAT'S THE FRAT'S NICKNAME

23:37.917 --> 23:39.118
ON CAMPUS.

23:39.151 --> 23:41.554
- OKAY, THAT HELPS.

23:41.588 --> 23:43.122
TWO VICTIMS
DOES NOT A FACTORY MAKE.

23:43.155 --> 23:45.992
FIND THE OTHERS.
- THAT'S EASY FOR YOU TO SAY.

23:46.025 --> 23:47.026
- OH, WHAT'S THE MATTER?

23:47.059 --> 23:49.929
NYPD RUN OUT OF TROJAN HORSES?

23:52.098 --> 23:54.200
- NO MORE IT'S JUST
A WOMAN'S PROBLEM.

23:54.233 --> 23:56.736
GUYS, IT'S YOURS TOO.

23:56.769 --> 23:59.205
THESE GIRLS COULD BE
YOUR SISTERS, YOUR FRIENDS.

23:59.238 --> 24:01.808
- IT'S NOT OKAY
TO LOOK THE OTHER WAY.

24:01.841 --> 24:04.010
IF YOU SEE SOMETHING,
STEP UP, STOP IT,

24:04.043 --> 24:05.978
OR CALL US FOR HELP.

24:06.012 --> 24:08.981
- AND JUST TO BE CLEAR,
IT DOES NOT MATTER

24:09.015 --> 24:10.483
IF YOU WERE FLIRTING
WITH A GUY,

24:10.517 --> 24:12.118
DANCING WITH HIM,
OR EVEN

24:12.151 --> 24:13.686
IF YOU STARTED MAKING OUT
WITH HIM ON HIS BED.

24:13.720 --> 24:14.987
- THAT'S RIGHT.
YOU HAVE THE RIGHT

24:15.021 --> 24:18.825
TO SAY NO TO SEX ANYTIME.

24:18.858 --> 24:21.060
AND IF YOU SAY NO,
AND HE DOESN'T LISTEN,

24:21.093 --> 24:22.529
THAT'S RAPE.

24:22.562 --> 24:24.030
- THANK YOU, DETECTIVES.

24:24.063 --> 24:27.066
I'D ALSO LIKE TO REMIND
ALL FEMALE STUDENTS

24:27.099 --> 24:29.669
THAT CAMPUS SECURITY
HAS DECIDED TO PROVIDE

24:29.702 --> 24:33.172
SAFETY SHUTTLE BUSES
ON FRIDAY AND SATURDAY NIGHTS.

24:33.205 --> 24:37.777
DON'T WALK HOME ALONE.
DON'T MAKE YOURSELF A TARGET.

24:40.179 --> 24:42.214
- AND FINALLY,
IF ANYONE HERE

24:42.248 --> 24:43.883
HAS BEEN SEXUALLY ASSAULTED,

24:43.916 --> 24:46.085
OR YOU KNOW ANYONE
THAT HAS,

24:46.118 --> 24:48.655
IT'S NEVER TOO LATE
TO COME FORWARD.

24:48.688 --> 24:51.190
DENYING THE PAIN
DOESN'T MAKE IT GO AWAY.

24:51.223 --> 24:55.595
I'LL LEAVE THESE HERE.
PASS 'EM OUT TO YOUR FRIENDS.

24:55.628 --> 24:57.129
THANK YOU.

24:59.799 --> 25:00.900
- GLAD YOU CAME TODAY,
LINDSAY.

25:00.933 --> 25:02.134
- I WISH I HADN'T.

25:02.168 --> 25:03.836
IT FELT LIKE EVERYONE
WAS STARING AT ME.

25:03.870 --> 25:05.772
- I THOUGHT WHAT WE WERE
SAYING IN THERE

25:05.805 --> 25:07.073
RESONATED WITH A LOT
OF STUDENTS.

25:07.106 --> 25:09.942
THEN GO TALK TO THEM.
- LINDSAY...

25:14.280 --> 25:15.948
- WHAT HAPPENED?
HOW'S SHE DOING?

25:15.982 --> 25:17.750
- SHE HASN'T HIT BOTTOM...
YET,

25:17.784 --> 25:21.153
BUT SHE'S NOT READY
TO COME FORWARD.

25:21.187 --> 25:23.956
- DETECTIVE BENSON?
- YES, ALYSON?

25:23.990 --> 25:25.191
CAN I HELP YOU?

25:25.224 --> 25:28.094
- I DON'T KNOW.

25:28.127 --> 25:31.063
IT HAPPENED
THREE YEARS AGO.

25:33.933 --> 25:35.702
- CONGRATULATIONS,
YOU JUST FOUND ANOTHER CASE

25:35.735 --> 25:36.969
THAT COMPLETELY
UNDERCUTS ITSELF.

25:37.003 --> 25:37.837
SHE WAS RAPED
BY THE FRATERNITY.

25:37.870 --> 25:39.205
WHY DOES SHE ORGANIZE
MIXERS FOR THEM?

25:39.238 --> 25:41.073
- SHE'S NOT
THE ONLY VICTIM.

25:41.107 --> 25:42.274
WE HAVE STATEMENTS
FROM THREE OTHER GIRLS

25:42.308 --> 25:45.011
IN HER SORORITY,
AND SIX OTHERS REPORTING

25:45.044 --> 25:47.013
SEXUAL ASSAULT
AT TAU OMEGA.

25:47.046 --> 25:49.181
- ALL OF THEM DRUNKEN
"HE SAID, SHE SAIDS"?

25:49.215 --> 25:50.850
- ANY REPEAT OFFENDERS?

25:50.883 --> 25:53.052
- YEAH, TRAVIS HOLMES.
HE'S A SERIAL.

25:53.085 --> 25:54.821
AND WESLEY AND CARTER
WERE EACH IMPLICATED

25:54.854 --> 25:56.656
IN THREE OTHER CASES.

25:56.689 --> 25:59.158
PLUS, THERE'S BEEN SOME BOYS
THAT HAVE ALREADY GRADUATED.

25:59.191 --> 26:00.727
- LET ME ASK YOU THIS--

26:00.760 --> 26:02.328
ANYONE'S NAME
ONLY COME UP ONCE?

26:02.361 --> 26:04.130
ALYSON SAYS SHE WAS ASSAULTED
THREE YEARS AGO

26:04.163 --> 26:06.999
BY TRAVIS AND JOE DAWSON.

26:07.033 --> 26:09.001
- JOE DAWSON
WAS THE GOOD SAMARITAN

26:09.035 --> 26:10.837
THAT SAVED LINDSAY
ON THE ROOF.

26:10.870 --> 26:12.839
- YOU THINK HE'D TURN
ON HIS FRATERNITY BROTHERS?

26:12.872 --> 26:15.174
- MOST OF THESE RAPISTS
ARE SOCIOPATHS.

26:15.207 --> 26:17.009
SOME OF THESE GUYS,
THEY GO ALONG WITH IT ONE TIME,

26:17.043 --> 26:18.310
THEN THEY REALIZE
THEY MADE A MISTAKE.

26:18.344 --> 26:20.046
- THEY HAVE
A GUILTY CONSCIENCE.

26:20.079 --> 26:21.648
- OR THEY'RE SCARED
OF THE LEGAL SYSTEM.

26:21.681 --> 26:26.185
- EITHER WAY,
WORK THIS GUY.

26:26.218 --> 26:28.187
- THREE YEARS AGO?

26:28.220 --> 26:30.356
ALYSON SAID I RAPED HER?

26:30.389 --> 26:33.125
WE JUST PLANNED THE TRAFFIC
LIGHT PARTY TOGETHER.

26:33.159 --> 26:34.393
SHE CAN'T SAY THAT NOW.

26:34.426 --> 26:36.062
- IT'S WITHIN THE STATUTE
OF LIMITATIONS.

26:36.095 --> 26:38.130
ARE YOU PRELAW?

26:38.164 --> 26:40.132
THEN YOU SHOULD KNOW
EVERY LAW SCHOOL CHECKS

26:40.166 --> 26:43.369
IF YOU'VE EVEN BEEN ACCUSED
OF A FELONY.

26:43.402 --> 26:45.772
- YOU CAN'T DO THAT.
- YES, WE CAN.

26:45.805 --> 26:47.339
BUT WE DON'T HAVE TO.

26:47.373 --> 26:50.109
WAS THIS YOUR IDEA?
- OR YOUR FRAT BROTHERS'?

26:50.142 --> 26:52.178
- SHE SAID IT WAS
A GANG RAPE.

26:52.211 --> 26:54.146
- I KNOW THIS WASN'T A RAPE.

26:54.180 --> 26:56.015
I ASKED THE HEAD
OF CAMPUS SECURITY.

26:56.048 --> 26:58.350
- YOU REPORTED YOURSELF
TO CAMPUS SECURITY?

26:58.384 --> 27:01.087
- I WAS...CONFUSED
ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED.

27:01.120 --> 27:04.090
- YOU MEAN YOU KNEW
YOU'D CROSSED THE LINE.

27:04.123 --> 27:06.392
- I WASN'T SURE.
WE WERE ALL KINDA STONED.

27:06.425 --> 27:08.060
- THAT DOESN'T MATTER,
JOE.

27:08.094 --> 27:09.295
SHE SAID
SHE DIDN'T WANT IT.

27:09.328 --> 27:11.130
- I MEAN, MAYBE
SHE'S SAYING THAT NOW.

27:11.163 --> 27:12.965
BUT AFTER IT HAPPENED,
I TEXTED HER AND ASKED HER OUT.

27:12.999 --> 27:14.200
SHE SAID YES.

27:14.233 --> 27:16.035
- THIS LEO BARTH'S IDEA?

27:16.068 --> 27:18.204
YOU WEREN'T SURE
IF YOU RAPED HER,

27:18.237 --> 27:20.106
SO AFTERWARDS
YOU ASKED HER OUT?

27:20.139 --> 27:22.341
- BARTH TOLD ME TO,
AS A TEST.

27:22.374 --> 27:25.077
SHE TEXTED BACK RIGHT AWAY,
"JOE, I CAN'T WAIT."

27:25.111 --> 27:26.445
I SHOWED BARTH,
AND HE SAID

27:26.478 --> 27:28.347
THERE'S NO WAY
A RAPE VICTIM WOULD SAY THAT.

27:28.380 --> 27:29.782
- WHAT ABOUT TRAVIS?
DID BARTH TELL HIM

27:29.816 --> 27:31.017
TO TEXT LINDSAY?

27:31.050 --> 27:33.185
- I HEARD THAT WASN'T
A RAPE EITHER.

27:33.219 --> 27:37.123
- LOOK, THIS ISN'T
WHAT OTHER FRATS ARE ABOUT.

27:37.156 --> 27:39.726
THESE GUYS,
THEY'RE CRIMINALS.

27:39.759 --> 27:42.161
THEY'RE NOT YOUR BROTHERS.

27:42.194 --> 27:44.330
- LOOK, I'M SORRY THAT GIRL
HAD A BAD NIGHT.

27:44.363 --> 27:46.198
BUT TRAVIS?
WHY WOULD A GUY LIKE THAT

27:46.232 --> 27:49.201
NEED TO RAPE SOMEBODY?

27:49.235 --> 27:51.103
- YEAH, I TOLD JOE
IT WASN'T RAPE.

27:51.137 --> 27:53.205
THE GIRL, ALYSON,
NEVER MADE A COMPLAINT.

27:53.239 --> 27:55.141
TEXTED HIM THE NEXT DAY.

27:55.174 --> 27:56.876
- AFTER YOU TOLD HIM
TO TEXT HER.

27:56.909 --> 27:59.045
- I DIDN'T TELL HER
TO TEXT HIM BACK.

27:59.078 --> 28:01.447
I FIGURED IF SHE'D BEEN RAPED,
SHE WOULD HAVE COME TO ME,

28:01.480 --> 28:03.282
FILED CHARGES--
MY DOOR'S ALWAYS OPEN.

28:03.315 --> 28:05.017
- YEAH, JUST LIKE
WITH LINDSAY?

28:05.051 --> 28:07.053
HER CLOTHES WERE TORN.
SHE WAS HYSTERICAL.

28:07.086 --> 28:08.487
AND YOU OKAYED HER
TAKING A SHOWER.

28:08.520 --> 28:11.290
- AND YOU FIGURED WHAT,
SHE TORE HER OWN CLOTHES OFF?

28:11.323 --> 28:14.193
- LISTEN, YOU SHOULD SEE
THIS PLACE ON SUNDAY MORNING.

28:14.226 --> 28:17.063
THESE KIDS AWAY FROM HOME
FOR THE FIRST TIME,

28:17.096 --> 28:18.497
THEY'RE ALL OUT OF CONTROL.

28:18.530 --> 28:20.967
I SHOULD TURN IN A GUY
EVERY TIME A GIRL PUTS OUT

28:21.000 --> 28:22.168
AND DOESN'T GET FLOWERS
THE NEXT DAY?

28:22.201 --> 28:24.136
- EXCUSE ME?

28:24.170 --> 28:25.805
- LISTEN, I'M JUST TRYING
TO KEEP THESE KIDS ALIVE.

28:25.838 --> 28:27.506
ALL RIGHT? MAKE SURE
THEY DON'T DRINK AND DRIVE

28:27.539 --> 28:29.108
OR O.D. OR GET KNIFED.

28:29.141 --> 28:32.378
I CAN'T POLICE THEIR BEDROOMS.

28:34.981 --> 28:36.749
- CAMPUS SECURITY
COACHED THIS JOE

28:36.783 --> 28:38.050
ON HOW TO DERAIL
A RAPE VICTIM?

28:38.084 --> 28:39.886
- YEAH, BECAUSE THEY'RE
KEEPING RAPE STATS DOWN.

28:39.919 --> 28:41.420
IT'S JUST LIKE COOKING
THE BOOKS FOR COMPSTAT.

28:41.453 --> 28:43.122
- BLAMING VICTIMS,
SHAMING 'EM--

28:43.155 --> 28:45.057
IT'S UNIVERSITY POLICY.
- IT'S ALL ABOUT CONTROL.

28:45.091 --> 28:47.059
I MEAN, THEY DO
THEIR OWN INVESTIGATIONS.

28:47.093 --> 28:50.763
IF THE SCHOOL DECIDES THAT
NO CRIME HAS BEEN COMMITTED,

28:50.797 --> 28:53.132
IT'S DROPPED--
NO PRESS, NO POLICE.

28:53.165 --> 28:54.100
- WE NEED TO GO AFTER
THE SCHOOL.

28:54.133 --> 28:55.868
- AND CHARGE 'EM
WITH WHAT?

28:55.902 --> 28:57.036
- THAT'S THE GREAT PART
ABOUT BEING A D.A.

28:57.069 --> 28:58.104
I DON'T HAVE TO
DECIDE THAT RIGHT NOW.

28:58.137 --> 28:59.972
I CAN CONVENE A GRAND JURY.

29:00.006 --> 29:01.207
- YOU THINK THEY'LL COME IN,
WAIVE IMMUNITY,

29:01.240 --> 29:02.809
AND TESTIFY?
- THEY HAVE TO.

29:02.842 --> 29:03.810
THEY DON'T WANT WORD
TO LEAK OUT THAT THEY'RE

29:03.843 --> 29:04.811
NOT COOPERATING.

29:04.844 --> 29:05.812
AND YOU KNOW MY OFFICE,

29:05.845 --> 29:07.213
IT LEAKS LIKE A CHURCH ROOF.

29:07.246 --> 29:08.948
- WHAT ABOUT
THESE FRAT BOYS?

29:08.981 --> 29:11.818
- THE FIRST RULE OF BUREAUCRACY
IS SELF-PRESERVATION.

29:11.851 --> 29:12.952
THOSE BOYS BECOME
A LIABILITY,

29:12.985 --> 29:16.055
THEY WILL CUT THEM LOOSE

29:16.088 --> 29:17.189
- I'M NOT MAD AT ALYSON
FOR SENDING ME IN THERE.

29:17.223 --> 29:18.891
IT'S NOT HER FAULT.

29:18.925 --> 29:20.126
- WELL, IF YOU AND SHE
TESTIFIED, LINDSAY--

29:20.159 --> 29:22.228
- TO WHAT? I'VE DECIDED
IT NEVER HAPPENED.

29:22.261 --> 29:23.529
I'VE LET IT GO.

29:23.562 --> 29:26.198
- SWEETHEART, THAT'S--

29:26.232 --> 29:28.100
THAT'S NOT GONNA WORK.

29:28.134 --> 29:30.202
OKAY, HAVE YOU TALKED
TO SOMEONE?

29:30.236 --> 29:31.503
A THERAPIST--
- WHY?

29:31.537 --> 29:33.940
I'M ALL BETTER NOW.
OKAY?

29:33.973 --> 29:35.942
- OKAY.

29:35.975 --> 29:38.978
UM, IF YOU NEED ANYTHING,
YOU CALL--

29:50.923 --> 29:51.157
.

29:51.190 --> 29:51.757
- WHY DIDN'T I COME FORWARD?

29:53.192 --> 29:55.161
WELL, PART OF IT WAS
PEER PRESSURE.

29:55.194 --> 29:57.930
I DIDN'T WANT THE SORORITY
TO BLACKBALL ME

29:57.964 --> 30:00.499
OR CALL ME A SLUT.

30:00.532 --> 30:02.234
- WERE THERE ANY OTHER
FACTORS?

30:02.268 --> 30:05.304
- I ALSO SPOKE TO THE HEAD
OF CAMPUS SECURITY.

30:05.337 --> 30:09.075
MR. BARTH SAID SEX WAS
LIKE A FOOTBALL GAME.

30:09.108 --> 30:11.310
SOMETIMES WHEN YOU WATCH
YOUR GAME TAPE,

30:11.343 --> 30:14.914
YOU CAN SEE YOUR MISTAKES
AND DO BETTER NEXT TIME.

30:14.947 --> 30:17.183
- WHAT DID YOU TAKE THAT
TO MEAN?

30:17.216 --> 30:19.451
- THAT I HAD MADE
A MISTAKE.

30:19.485 --> 30:21.320
THAT IT WAS MY FAULT.

30:21.353 --> 30:23.255
- AND HOW DID TAU OMEGA
TREAT YOU?

30:23.289 --> 30:27.059
- THEY STARTED POSTING
TOP TEN TIPS FOR RAPE.

30:27.093 --> 30:29.295
LIKE SPIKE HER DRINK.

30:29.328 --> 30:31.563
I WAS NUMBER SEVEN.

30:31.597 --> 30:34.166
"GO FOR WHITE TRASH,
LIKE RENEE CLARK.

30:34.200 --> 30:36.268
THEY'LL BE GRATEFUL
FOR THE ATTENTION."

30:36.302 --> 30:37.403
- WAS THE SCHOOL AWARE
OF THIS?

30:37.436 --> 30:39.071
- I FILED MULTIPLE
COMPLAINTS,

30:39.105 --> 30:41.240
BUT I NEVER GOT TAKEN OFF
TSU-UNDERGROUND.

30:41.273 --> 30:43.375
THE DEAN SAID
IT WAS FREE SPEECH.

30:43.409 --> 30:46.345
- WHY DID YOU DECIDE TO WITHDRAW
YOUR RAPE ALLEGATION?

30:46.378 --> 30:47.980
- TALIA TOLD ME THAT
THE DISCIPLINARY--

30:48.014 --> 30:49.315
- TALIA--I'M SORRY.

30:49.348 --> 30:51.383
TALIA BLAINE,
THE SCHOOL COUNSELOR?

30:51.417 --> 30:53.419
- YES.

30:53.452 --> 30:55.955
SHE TOLD ME THAT
AT THE DISCIPLINARY HEARING,

30:55.988 --> 30:58.257
I WOULD HAVE TO SIT
WITH MY ATTACKER

30:58.290 --> 31:01.293
AND LISTEN TO HIM
CALL ME A LIAR.

31:01.327 --> 31:03.329
- AND WHAT HAPPENED
AFTER THAT?

31:03.362 --> 31:06.132
- I GOT SEVERELY DEPRESSED,

31:06.165 --> 31:09.335
AND EVENTUALLY AGREED
TO THE SCHOOL'S SUGGESTION

31:09.368 --> 31:11.203
I BE INSTITUTIONALIZED.

31:11.237 --> 31:13.139
- AND ARE YOU BACK
AT THE SCHOOL NOW?

31:13.172 --> 31:15.007
- NO.

31:15.041 --> 31:18.077
I CAN ONLY RETURN TO SCHOOL
WITH PARENTAL SUPERVISION.

31:18.110 --> 31:21.213
MY PARENTS ARE NOT
VERY INVOLVED,

31:21.247 --> 31:24.050
SO I'M BASICALLY EXPELLED.

31:24.083 --> 31:26.986
- AND THE STUDENT
WHOM YOU ACCUSED OF RAPE?

31:27.019 --> 31:29.355
- HE'LL GRADUATE THIS YEAR.

31:29.388 --> 31:31.357
WITH HONORS.

31:31.390 --> 31:33.592
HE'LL BE ATTENDING OXFORD
IN THE FALL.

31:33.625 --> 31:37.997
- SO YOU WERE A FRESHMAN STUDENT
ON SCHOLARSHIP

31:38.030 --> 31:39.365
A LONG WAY FROM HOME.

31:39.398 --> 31:42.234
DO YOU FEEL THAT THE SCHOOL
LOOKED OUT FOR YOU?

31:43.735 --> 31:46.338
- I WAS RAPED
ON THEIR CAMPUS...

31:46.372 --> 31:48.975
NOT BELIEVED BY SECURITY,

31:49.008 --> 31:52.979
AND ADVISED TO FORGET IT
BY THEIR COUNSELOR.

31:53.012 --> 31:55.347
AND WHEN I GOT DEPRESSED,
THEY SAID I WAS CRAZY,

31:55.381 --> 31:57.549
AND THEY HAD ME COMMITTED.

32:00.419 --> 32:05.557
PLEASE DON'T LET THEM GET AWAY
WITH WHAT THEY'VE DONE TO ME.

32:05.591 --> 32:07.359
- YOU WERE VERY BRAVE, RENEE.
THE JURORS WERE LISTENING.

32:07.393 --> 32:09.461
- WHAT HAPPENS NOW?

32:09.495 --> 32:11.330
- WE MOVE FOR AN INDICTMENT
AGAINST THE SCHOOL,

32:11.363 --> 32:13.332
HOPE THEY STOP PROTECTING
TRAVIS AND THE OTHER BOYS.

32:13.365 --> 32:14.700
- AND ME?

32:14.733 --> 32:16.502
- WE NEED TO GET YOU BACK
TO THE HOSPITAL.

32:16.535 --> 32:21.607
- OKAY.
I'M GONNA TELL THEM.

32:21.640 --> 32:25.277
I'VE DECIDED TO STOP
THE E.C.T.

32:25.311 --> 32:28.580
JUST BEING BELIEVED,
I FEEL SO MUCH BETTER.

32:28.614 --> 32:30.449
I WANT TO GO BACK TO SCHOOL.

32:30.482 --> 32:34.220
- SCHOOL.
BACK TO TOMPKINS SQUARE?

32:34.253 --> 32:37.056
- I DON'T WANT THEM TO WIN.

32:37.089 --> 32:40.726
- WELL, MAYBE WE CAN
FIGURE OUT A WAY

32:40.759 --> 32:44.296
AROUND
THE PARENTAL SUPERVISION RULE.

32:46.498 --> 32:49.401
WHAT'S YOUR GUT
ON THE JURY?

32:49.435 --> 32:51.170
- THEY BELIEVED THE GIRLS.

32:51.203 --> 32:53.272
- WELL, THAT'S THE EASY PART,
ISN'T IT?

32:53.305 --> 32:54.606
- NOW COMES THE FUN PART.

32:54.640 --> 32:57.043
BY NOW, THE SCHOOL
SHOULD BE IN A FRENZY.

32:57.076 --> 32:59.178
EMERGENCY MEETINGS,
COVERING UP EVIDENCE.

32:59.211 --> 33:01.380
- YOU MEAN YOU'RE SMELLING
THE BLOOD IN THE WATER.

33:01.413 --> 33:04.383
- AREN'T YOU?

33:07.286 --> 33:10.089
- AS THE SCHOOL'S
MENTAL HEALTH COUNSELOR,

33:10.122 --> 33:13.359
YOU ADVISED RENEE CLARK
NOT TO GO THROUGH

33:13.392 --> 33:15.394
WITH THE DISCIPLINARY HEARING?

33:15.427 --> 33:17.296
- SHE WAS DEPRESSED,
ANXIOUS ABOUT BEING IN THE ROOM

33:17.329 --> 33:18.297
WITH HER ALLEGED ATTACKER.

33:18.330 --> 33:19.765
I WASN'T GOING TO LIE
TO HER.

33:19.798 --> 33:21.233
I TOLD HER THAT CAN SOMETIMES
LEAD TO FEELINGS

33:21.267 --> 33:22.634
OF RE-VICTIMIZATION.

33:22.668 --> 33:24.470
- ISN'T IT ALSO POSSIBLE
THAT SHE WAS DEPRESSED

33:24.503 --> 33:26.372
BECAUSE OF LACK OF SUPPORT
FROM THE SCHOOL,

33:26.405 --> 33:28.040
THE DEAN, FROM YOU--

33:28.074 --> 33:30.176
THE COUNSELOR WHO WAS SUPPOSED
TO LOOK OUT FOR HER?

33:30.209 --> 33:31.677
- I JUST DON'T WANT
THESE GIRLS HURT.

33:31.710 --> 33:34.313
- OR RAPED.
- OF COURSE NOT.

33:34.346 --> 33:36.182
- AFTER HEARING MULTIPLE TIMES
FROM MULTIPLE VICTIMS

33:36.215 --> 33:39.485
ACCUSATIONS OF RAPE
AGAINST TAU OMEGA,

33:39.518 --> 33:41.653
DID YOU EVER WARN
INCOMING FRESHMAN GIRLS

33:41.687 --> 33:43.689
NOT TO ATTEND PARTIES
AT THAT FRATERNITY?

33:43.722 --> 33:48.227
- THAT'S NOT MY JOB.
- THAT'S NOT YOUR JOB?

33:48.260 --> 33:53.465
OKAY, DID YOU EVER REPORT
TO THE ADMINISTRATION

33:53.499 --> 33:55.467
THAT THERE WAS A PROBLEM
AT THAT FRAT?

33:55.501 --> 33:57.536
- YES, I DID.

33:57.569 --> 33:59.638
- WHAT WAS THEIR RESPONSE?

33:59.671 --> 34:02.208
- THAT TAU OMEGA HAD A LONG
AND DISTINGUISHED HISTORY,

34:02.241 --> 34:04.510
THAT THEIR ALUMNI
ARE ON THE BOARD.

34:04.543 --> 34:08.314
I NEEDED TO KEEP THINGS
IN PERSPECTIVE.

34:08.347 --> 34:11.183
- TAU OMEGA RECENTLY HELD
A RUSH EVENT

34:11.217 --> 34:13.319
WHERE FRAT BROTHERS
WERE CAPTURED ON VIDEO

34:13.352 --> 34:16.255
CHANTING, "NO MEANS YES.
YES MEANS ANAL."

34:16.288 --> 34:18.690
YOU APPROVE PERMITS
FOR EVENTS LIKE THIS,

34:18.724 --> 34:19.758
IS THAT CORRECT?

34:19.791 --> 34:22.361
- YES.
I DON'T APPROVE,

34:22.394 --> 34:26.198
BUT TSU STUDENTS
HAVE THE RIGHT TO ASSEMBLE,

34:26.232 --> 34:29.101
AND THE RIGHT TO FREE SPEECH.

34:29.135 --> 34:33.105
- HOW ABOUT THIS?

34:33.139 --> 34:37.109
"RUSH TAU OMEGA. WE DON'T TAKE
'NO' FOR AN ANSWER."

34:37.143 --> 34:38.344
YOU APPROVE THIS DESIGN?

34:38.377 --> 34:40.212
- IT WAS SOLD
BY AN ALUMNI ORGANIZATION,

34:40.246 --> 34:42.581
SO IT WAS OUTSIDE
MY PURVIEW.

34:42.614 --> 34:44.283
- IS IT TRUE THAT MEMBERS
OF TAU OMEGA

34:44.316 --> 34:46.285
WERE SEEN ON CAMPUS WEARING
THIS T-SHIRT FOR MONTHS

34:46.318 --> 34:48.587
DESPITE NUMEROUS COMPLAINTS
TO YOUR OFFICE?

34:48.620 --> 34:51.890
- WE DON'T BAN
T-SHIRT SLOGANS AT TSU

34:51.923 --> 34:54.293
NO MATTER WHAT
I FIND OFFENSIVE.

34:54.326 --> 34:56.295
OUR STUDENTS
CHOSE A PROGRESSIVE

34:56.328 --> 34:57.863
LIBERAL ARTS UNIVERSITY
FOR A REASON.

34:57.896 --> 34:59.431
- HOW MANY SEX CRIMES
COMPLAINTS

34:59.465 --> 35:01.367
HAS YOUR OFFICE REPORTED
IN THE LAST THREE YEARS?

35:01.400 --> 35:04.203
- A FEW DOZEN.
- 25.

35:04.236 --> 35:06.272
AT A SCHOOL
WITH 20,000 UNDERGRADS.

35:06.305 --> 35:09.141
DID YOU KNOW THAT MOST SCHOOLS
THE SIZE OF TSU HAVE AT LEAST

35:09.175 --> 35:13.312
TRIPLE YOUR NUMBER
OF SEX CRIMES?

35:13.345 --> 35:15.281
- THOSE LOW NUMBERS,
THEY PROVE

35:15.314 --> 35:17.216
OUR SAFETY INITIATIVES
ARE WORKING.

35:17.249 --> 35:18.750
- OR MAYBE THEY PROVE
THAT YOU'VE JUST THROWN OUT

35:18.784 --> 35:21.387
INCIDENT REPORTS WHENEVER
YOUR ISSUES WERE RESOLVED.

35:21.420 --> 35:23.522
- NO.

35:23.555 --> 35:26.792
- DID YOU EVER SEE A REPORT
WITH SEXUAL ASSAULT CHARGES

35:26.825 --> 35:28.827
THAT WAS LATER RETRACTED?

35:28.860 --> 35:30.296
- WE ARE REQUIRED
BY THE CLERY ACT

35:30.329 --> 35:32.798
TO DISCLOSE ALL CRIMES
THAT ANY EMPLOYEE

35:32.831 --> 35:34.166
BECOMES AWARE OF.

35:34.200 --> 35:36.435
- YES OR NO?

35:36.468 --> 35:38.304
- NO, TO THE BEST
OF MY KNOWLEDGE.

35:38.337 --> 35:40.372
- TO THE BEST
OF YOUR KNOWLEDGE.

35:40.406 --> 35:41.773
WERE YOU COACHED TO SAY THAT,

35:41.807 --> 35:44.176
OR ARE YOU JUST ADEPT
AT DISSEMBLING?

35:44.210 --> 35:47.279
- NO MEANS NO.

35:47.313 --> 35:51.283
I NEVER HID REPORTS
OR CHARGES.

35:54.820 --> 35:56.955
- THE DEAN DIDN'T GIVE UP
THE BOYS.

35:56.988 --> 35:59.791
INSTEAD, SHE CLAIMS
THAT THEY REPORTED

35:59.825 --> 36:01.593
EVERY COMPLAINT
THEY EVER RECEIVED.

36:01.627 --> 36:03.462
- SO SHE LIED ON THE STAND.
- YEAH.

36:03.495 --> 36:05.597
NOW I JUST HAVE
TO PROVE IT.

36:05.631 --> 36:07.333
HER HEAD OF SECURITY
IS A GOOD SOLDIER,

36:07.366 --> 36:08.800
BUT THAT COUNSELOR,
SHE WAS WAVERING.

36:08.834 --> 36:10.269
[cell phone rings]
- SHE'S FEELING GUILTY.

36:10.302 --> 36:12.638
- MAYBE YOU'RE RIGHT.
IT'S TALIA.

36:12.671 --> 36:14.673
BENSON.

36:20.512 --> 36:22.581
[siren in distance]

36:30.021 --> 36:32.591
- OH, MY GOD.
LINDSAY?

36:32.624 --> 36:36.895
WHAT HAPPENED?
- SHE JUMPED. FROM THE ROOF.

36:36.928 --> 36:38.397
- SHE WAS STANDING
ON THE EDGE.

36:38.430 --> 36:40.399
SOME STUDENTS SAW HER,
TRIED TO TALK HER DOWN,

36:40.432 --> 36:41.400
BUT BY THE TIME
SECURITY GOT THERE--

36:41.433 --> 36:43.569
- THEY WERE TOO LATE.

36:45.036 --> 36:48.940
- I HAVE TO GO CALL
HER MOTHER.

36:48.974 --> 36:51.543
- I JUST TALKED
TO HER YESTERDAY.

36:51.577 --> 36:52.944
- THIS ISN'T YOUR FAULT,
AMANDA.

36:52.978 --> 36:54.613
YOU DID EVERYTHING YOU COULD.
- COME ON.

36:54.646 --> 36:57.549
NO, NO, SHE WAS PINK CLOUDING,
AND I KNEW IT.

37:03.289 --> 37:05.391
- HEY, JOE. HEY.

37:05.424 --> 37:08.360
LAST TIME WE TALKED, YOU SAID
YOU FELT BAD FOR LINDSAY.

37:08.394 --> 37:10.562
HOW DO YOU FEEL NOW?

37:10.596 --> 37:14.300
YOU'RE DIFFERENT
THAN THESE OTHER GUYS, JOE.

37:14.333 --> 37:17.503
I KNOW IT, YOU KNOW IT.
YOU SAVED HER THE OTHER NIGHT.

37:17.536 --> 37:20.306
BUT AFTER
WHAT THEY DID TO HER,

37:20.339 --> 37:22.941
IT WAS ONLY A MATTER
OF TIME, RIGHT?

37:22.974 --> 37:25.511
SO I'M GONNA ASK YOU AGAIN.

37:25.544 --> 37:29.348
IF NOTHING HAPPENED TO HER,
WHY'D SHE JUMP?

37:31.617 --> 37:33.319
- IT DID HAPPEN.

37:33.352 --> 37:36.355
ALL RIGHT?
SHE WAS TELLING THE TRUTH.

37:36.388 --> 37:39.358
ALL OF US, INCLUDING ME,
WE JUST--

37:49.501 --> 37:49.735
.

37:49.768 --> 37:50.702
- LINDSAY COULDN'T SAY NO
WITH HER MOUTH FULL.

37:52.371 --> 37:53.672
[laughter]
- WE RAPED HER DEAD.

37:53.705 --> 37:55.974
WE RAPED HER GANG-BANG
GANGNAM STYLE!

37:56.007 --> 37:57.643
[laughter]

37:57.676 --> 37:59.445
- THREE OF US
AT THE SAME TIME--

37:59.478 --> 38:00.779
THAT GIRL WAS AIRTIGHT!

38:00.812 --> 38:03.949
- YEAH!

38:03.982 --> 38:05.584
- TOOK IT
WITH HIS CELL PHONE

38:05.617 --> 38:06.718
THE NIGHT OF THE PARTY.

38:06.752 --> 38:07.886
- AND WHAT THEY WERE SAYING,

38:07.919 --> 38:12.424
I KNEW IT WAS WRONG,
AND...

38:12.458 --> 38:13.659
I'M SORRY.

38:13.692 --> 38:16.595
- YOU SHOULD BE.

38:16.628 --> 38:20.532
- I'LL CALL BARBA.

38:20.566 --> 38:21.667
- WE RAPED HER DEAD.

38:21.700 --> 38:24.736
WE RAPED HER GANG-BANG
GANGNAM STYLE!

38:24.770 --> 38:27.005
[laughter]

38:27.038 --> 38:28.707
- THREE OF US
AT THE SAME TIME.

38:28.740 --> 38:30.609
THAT GIRL WAS AIRTIGHT.

38:32.744 --> 38:34.513
- DON'T SAY
WE DIDN'T WARN YOU.

38:34.546 --> 38:36.815
- I HAD NO IDEA
ABOUT ANY OF THIS.

38:36.848 --> 38:38.584
IF I HAD,
I WOULD'VE TAKEN ACTION.

38:38.617 --> 38:39.685
- DEAN MEYERSON, PLEASE.

38:39.718 --> 38:40.719
- YOU TOOK PLENTY OF ACTION

38:40.752 --> 38:41.987
THAT LED TO THIS.

38:42.020 --> 38:43.589
NOT SHUTTING DOWN
THESE FRATS,

38:43.622 --> 38:45.724
HIDING REPORTS.

38:45.757 --> 38:46.725
- THESE FRATERNITIES
HAVE BEEN HERE

38:46.758 --> 38:48.059
FOR OVER A CENTURY.

38:48.093 --> 38:50.028
AND I NEVER HID REPORTS.
- THAT WAS YOUR TESTIMONY.

38:50.061 --> 38:52.398
BUT AFTER LINDSAY'S SUICIDE,
WE GOT A LOT OF CALLS,

38:52.431 --> 38:54.866
EMAILS, ZIP DRIVES.

38:54.900 --> 38:57.869
YOU'VE MADE SOME ENEMIES.

38:57.903 --> 39:01.607
- WHAT DO YOU WANT?

39:07.946 --> 39:10.816
- THE DEAN IS WILLING
TO RESIGN AT THE END OF JUNE.

39:10.849 --> 39:12.150
- TWO DAYS AGO, GREAT,
BUT I HAVE EVIDENCE

39:12.183 --> 39:14.986
OF PERJURY AND OBSTRUCTION.

39:15.020 --> 39:17.689
AFFIDAVITS FROM YOUR
MENTAL HEALTH COUNSELOR

39:17.723 --> 39:19.591
AND CAMPUS PATROL
THAT SCHOOL POLICY WAS

39:19.625 --> 39:21.026
"DON'T TELL, DON'T REPORT."

39:22.694 --> 39:25.731
- A YEAR'S PROBATION
AT MOST, DEAN MEYERSON.

39:25.764 --> 39:28.634
- NOT QUITE.
WE'RE CHARGING TRAVIS CARTER

39:28.667 --> 39:30.168
AND WESLEY WITH MULTIPLE
COUNTS OF RAPE.

39:30.201 --> 39:34.039
AND YOU AND MR. BARTH,
FROM CAMPUS SECURITY,

39:34.072 --> 39:35.674
ARE BEING NAMED
AS ACCESSORIES.

39:35.707 --> 39:37.175
- ACCESSORY TO RAPE?

39:37.208 --> 39:40.045
- NO. I HAD NOTHING
TO DO WITH THAT.

39:40.078 --> 39:41.179
- IF YOU WANT TO COME BACK,
YOU CAN TELL THAT

39:41.212 --> 39:42.914
TO THE GRAND JURY.

39:42.948 --> 39:44.750
YOU ALREADY WAIVED
YOUR IMMUNITY.

40:17.883 --> 40:20.786
- I'M SO SORRY,
MRS. BENNETT.

40:20.819 --> 40:23.955
- LINDSAY...

40:23.989 --> 40:27.025
SHE WOULDN'T TALK
ABOUT IT.

40:27.058 --> 40:30.629
TOLD ME TO GO HOME.

40:30.662 --> 40:35.100
I WANTED TO GIVE HER SPACE.

40:35.133 --> 40:37.903
- I TALKED TO LINDSAY
THE DAY BEFORE.

40:37.936 --> 40:40.105
YOU KNOW, SHE WAS SO...

40:40.138 --> 40:42.073
I SHOULD HAVE KNOWN.
- NO.

40:42.107 --> 40:44.676
IT'S THE BOYS,

40:44.710 --> 40:48.547
THE SCHOOL...

40:48.580 --> 40:52.117
THEY KILLED MY BABY.

40:52.150 --> 40:55.754
I HOME-SCHOOLED HER
HER WHOLE LIFE.

40:55.787 --> 40:59.157
I WAS ALWAYS AFRAID
TO LET HER GO.

41:01.660 --> 41:04.095
- YOU SURE YOU WANT
TO BE HERE?

41:04.129 --> 41:06.732
- I WANT TO PAY
MY RESPECTS.

41:06.765 --> 41:10.502
THE SCHOOL SAID
THEY'D LET ME COME BACK.

41:10.536 --> 41:13.772
THEY ACCEPTED YOUR OFFER
TO SUPERVISE ME.

41:13.805 --> 41:15.907
- I'M VERY HAPPY
TO HEAR THAT.

41:19.611 --> 41:23.148
- YOU KNOW,
I WAS THINKING ABOUT

41:23.181 --> 41:27.686
MAYBE STARTING A KIND OF
SUPPORT GROUP ON CAMPUS.

41:27.719 --> 41:31.757
SO, YOU KNOW, SURVIVORS KNOW
THAT THEY'RE NOT ALONE.

41:31.790 --> 41:34.726
YOU THINK
THAT'S A GOOD IDEA?

41:34.760 --> 41:39.798
- YEAH, I DO.
