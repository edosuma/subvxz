(male announcer)
IN THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM,

00:02.436 --> 00:05.273
SEXUALLY BASED OFFENSES ARE
CONSIDERED ESPECIALLY HEINOUS.

00:05.306 --> 00:07.675
IN NEW YORK CITY,
THE DEDICATED DETECTIVES

00:07.708 --> 00:09.410
WHO INVESTIGATE
THESE VICIOUS FELONIES

00:09.443 --> 00:11.212
ARE MEMBERS
OF AN ELITE SQUAD

00:11.245 --> 00:13.314
KNOWN AS
THE SPECIAL VICTIMS UNIT.

00:13.347 --> 00:15.349
THESE ARE THEIR STORIES.

00:18.686 --> 00:21.522
OKAY, YOU'RE SENSITIVE
AND CHARMING.

00:21.555 --> 00:23.157
NOW INVITE HER BACK
TO YOUR PLACE

00:23.191 --> 00:24.458
AND LET US GO HOME.

00:24.492 --> 00:26.227
WHAT DO YOU BET
HE STIFFS US HARDER

00:26.260 --> 00:27.295
THAN HE STIFFS HER?

00:31.099 --> 00:32.800
READY FOR THE CHECK?

00:32.833 --> 00:35.136
ACTUALLY WE WERE THINKING
ABOUT DESSERT.

00:35.169 --> 00:36.737
SOMETHING EXCITING.

00:36.770 --> 00:38.472
FLAMBÃ©, MAYBE.

00:38.506 --> 00:39.640
FOLKS, THE ONLY THING HERE
THAT'S FLAMING

00:39.673 --> 00:40.674
IS THE MAITRE D',

00:40.708 --> 00:42.176
AND HE LEFT AN HOUR AGO.

00:42.210 --> 00:43.277
TIME TO CALL IT A NIGHT.

00:43.311 --> 00:45.746
[screaming]

00:49.150 --> 00:50.651
OH, MY GOD!

00:52.420 --> 00:53.454
OH, MY GOD!

00:53.487 --> 00:55.189
[dishes crash]

00:59.827 --> 01:01.629
YOU DRAGGED MY ASS
OUT OF BED

01:01.662 --> 01:03.131
BECAUSE BENSON'S
ON VACATION?

01:03.164 --> 01:04.565
NOT A VACATION.

01:04.598 --> 01:05.799
SHE'S ON A THREE-DAY CONFERENCE
FOR BATTERED WOMEN.

01:05.833 --> 01:07.568
IT'S NOT EXACTLY
CLUB MED, YOU KNOW?

01:07.601 --> 01:10.404
WHAT DO WE GOT
ON THE MENU FOR TONIGHT?

01:10.438 --> 01:11.739
BARBECUE.

01:11.772 --> 01:13.207
A LITTLE TOO WELL-DONE.

01:13.241 --> 01:14.208
LET ME GO OUT
ON A LIMB HERE.

01:14.242 --> 01:15.443
NO I.D.

01:15.476 --> 01:18.212
YOU'VE DONE THIS BEFORE.

01:18.246 --> 01:19.147
A LOT OF NIGHTCLUBS
AROUND HERE.

01:19.180 --> 01:20.548
SO A WALL STREETER COMES
STUMBLING OUT DRUNK,

01:20.581 --> 01:21.715
GETS ROLLED.

01:21.749 --> 01:23.551
BUT WHY FRY THE POOR GUY?

01:23.584 --> 01:25.553
HE'S MISSING A FEW THINGS
MORE VALUABLE

01:25.586 --> 01:27.388
THAN HIS WALLET.

01:27.421 --> 01:29.557
OW, UH, YEAH,
GOOD-BYE FAMILY JEWELS.

01:29.590 --> 01:31.592
THEY GET BURNED OFF?

01:31.625 --> 01:33.394
NO, THERE'D BE CHARRED REMNANTS.

01:33.427 --> 01:34.795
I'D SAY IT WAS
A CHOP JOB.

01:34.828 --> 01:36.397
PROBABLY JUST BEFORE
HE WAS TORCHED.

01:36.430 --> 01:38.532
ANY IDEA WHERE
OUR CRISPY CRITTER

01:38.566 --> 01:39.667
CAME RUNNING FROM?

01:39.700 --> 01:43.737
FOLLOW THE BLOODY BRICK ROAD.

01:55.483 --> 01:57.618
I'D SAY THIS IS WHERE
HE LOST HIS BOYS.

01:57.651 --> 01:59.653
ACCELERANT ON THE GROUND.

01:59.687 --> 02:02.456
LOOKS LIKE HE WAS LIT UP
OVER BY THIS CAR.

02:02.490 --> 02:05.593
CASTRATED THEN IMMOLATED.

02:05.626 --> 02:07.628
WHOEVER DID IT WANTED
THIS GUY TO SUFFER.

02:58.446 --> 02:59.380
PUNCTURE WOUNDS MATCH
THE SCALPEL YOU FOUND.

02:59.413 --> 03:01.315
MORE THAN A DOZEN DEEP ONES
TO HIS GROIN,

03:01.349 --> 03:02.616
ABDOMEN, AND THIGHS.

03:02.650 --> 03:03.884
SLOPPY ATTACK.
EMOTIONAL.

03:03.917 --> 03:05.586
EXACTLY.

03:05.619 --> 03:07.221
THE EXCISED GENITALS SHOW
THE SAME KIND

03:07.255 --> 03:08.522
OF RAGGED HACKING.

03:08.556 --> 03:09.857
ARE WE DONE YET?

03:09.890 --> 03:11.559
IF IT'S ANY CONSOLATION,

03:11.592 --> 03:13.394
YOU'RE PROBABLY FEELING
MORE PAIN THAN HE DID.

03:13.427 --> 03:16.230
TOX SCREEN FOR ALCOHOL
AND CRACK WAS OFF THE CHART.

03:16.264 --> 03:18.299
SMALL MERCIES.
TOASTED THEN ROASTED.

03:18.332 --> 03:20.334
HOW'D YOU GET SO MUCH INFO
FROM BURNED SKIN?

03:20.368 --> 03:21.735
SAME WAY I'LL GET A PRINT.

03:21.769 --> 03:23.604
JUICE HIM UP.

03:23.637 --> 03:25.873
THE PROBLEM WITH FIRE-DAMAGED
TISSUE

03:25.906 --> 03:27.841
IS LOSS OF BODILY FLUIDS.

03:27.875 --> 03:30.778
REHYDRATION...

03:30.811 --> 03:33.481
RESTORES THE NATURAL CONTOURS.

03:37.951 --> 03:40.421
NOW...

03:40.454 --> 03:42.290
WE HOPE OUR VICTIM
HAS A RECORD.

03:42.323 --> 03:46.627
[machine beeping]

03:46.660 --> 03:48.762
AND THE WINNER IS...

03:48.796 --> 03:51.399
JOSHUA MICHAEL GALLI, 22.

03:51.432 --> 03:52.866
ARRESTS FOR LOITERING,

03:52.900 --> 03:53.934
TURNSTILE-JUMPING,

03:53.967 --> 03:55.135
AND PUBLIC URINATION.

03:55.168 --> 03:56.870
THESE ARE NOT THE USUAL BEEFS
THAT A WALL STREETER RACKS UP.

03:56.904 --> 04:00.874
(Warner)
MY GUESS,
THIS GUY WAS HOMELESS.

04:03.777 --> 04:05.613
(man)
MY BOY WASN'T HOMELESS.

04:05.646 --> 04:07.648
THIS WAS HIS HOME.

04:07.681 --> 04:10.584
PLAYED FOOTBALL FOR BLESSED
HEART HIGH SCHOOL.

04:10.618 --> 04:11.885
(Stabler)
GOOD TEAM.

04:11.919 --> 04:13.521
FACED 'EM A COUPLE TIMES
WHEN I WAS AT BAYSIDE.

04:13.554 --> 04:14.955
JOSH WAS TOUGH
ON THE FIELD.

04:14.988 --> 04:17.491
THAT'S WHERE HE LEFT IT.

04:17.525 --> 04:19.460
SWEETEST KID YOU EVER MET.

04:19.493 --> 04:20.961
FRIENDS WITH EVERYONE
ON THE BLOCK.

04:20.994 --> 04:22.630
EVEN AFTER HE GOT SICK.

04:22.663 --> 04:23.697
SICK WITH WHAT?

04:23.731 --> 04:25.633
SCHIZOPHRENIA.

04:25.666 --> 04:27.935
DIAGNOSED IN 12TH GRADE.

04:27.968 --> 04:29.603
HIS MOM COULDN'T TAKE IT.

04:29.637 --> 04:31.372
LEFT AFTER A YEAR.

04:31.405 --> 04:34.007
PISSED AT JOSH LIKE
HE WAS MAKING IT ALL UP.

04:34.041 --> 04:36.677
PISSED AT ME FOR BELIEVING HIM.

04:36.710 --> 04:37.678
IT'S HARD TO THINK
THAT SOMETHING'S WRONG

04:37.711 --> 04:39.413
WITH YOUR KID.

04:39.447 --> 04:40.681
I TOOK HIM TO EVERY
DOCTOR APPOINTMENT.

04:40.714 --> 04:43.617
WATCHED HIM TRY ONE PILL
AFTER ANOTHER.

04:43.651 --> 04:45.419
WHEN NONE OF THOSE WORKED,
HE...

04:45.453 --> 04:47.888
STARTED GETTING HIGH.

04:47.921 --> 04:48.756
WANDERING OFF FOR WEEKS.

04:48.789 --> 04:52.526
MR. GALLI, THE ATTACK
LOOKED PERSONAL.

04:52.560 --> 04:53.994
WAS JOSH HAVING TROUBLE
WITH ANYONE?

04:54.027 --> 04:55.095
I DON'T KNOW.

04:55.128 --> 04:56.096
LAST TIME HE WAS HOME

04:56.129 --> 04:58.098
WAS SEPTEMBER.

04:58.131 --> 05:00.934
HE JUST...WALKED THROUGH
THAT DOOR,

05:00.968 --> 05:03.937
SMILING, LIKE THE OLD JOSH.

05:03.971 --> 05:06.574
EVEN HAD HIMSELF
A JOB INTERVIEW.

05:06.607 --> 05:08.409
I MADE HIM BREAKFAST.

05:08.442 --> 05:09.543
WATCHED HIM HEAD OFF

05:09.577 --> 05:11.712
FOR HIS INTERVIEW.

05:11.745 --> 05:13.080
HE NEVER CAME BACK.

05:13.113 --> 05:14.948
SO NO ENEMIES THAT HE EVER
TALKED ABOUT?

05:14.982 --> 05:16.550
ONLY THE STREET CLEANERS.

05:16.584 --> 05:18.519
NOT THE BIG WHITE SWEEPER
TRUCKS.

05:18.552 --> 05:19.987
I'M TALKING ABOUT
THE SICK BASTARDS

05:20.020 --> 05:22.690
WHO HUNT THE HOMELESS
AND VIDEOTAPE IT.

05:22.723 --> 05:23.791
WHEN JOSH TOLD ME,

05:23.824 --> 05:25.526
I--I THOUGHT
HE WAS IMAGINING IT.

05:25.559 --> 05:26.994
LIKE A DELUSION.

05:27.027 --> 05:28.929
THEN I WENT ONLINE.

05:28.962 --> 05:30.964
FOUND THE VIDEOS THEY POST.

05:30.998 --> 05:32.733
SO EVERYONE CAN GET
A GOOD LAUGH

05:32.766 --> 05:36.404
WATCHING STREET PEOPLE
GETTING THEIR HEADS KICKED IN.

05:36.437 --> 05:39.072
[man laughing on monitor]
THIS IS WHAT A REAL STREET
CLEANING LOOKS LIKE.

05:39.106 --> 05:41.642
IF THE POLITICIANS
WON'T TAKE CARE OF THE TRASH,

05:41.675 --> 05:42.943
WE WILL!

05:42.976 --> 05:44.412
TWO DOZEN MORE OF THESE
ON THE WEB.

05:44.445 --> 05:46.614
DIFFERENT ATTACKS,
DIFFERENT VICTIMS.

05:46.647 --> 05:47.681
SAME RESULT.

05:47.715 --> 05:48.949
LOT OF BUSTED HEADS.

05:48.982 --> 05:51.919
AND THEY GOT THE BALLS
TO CROW ABOUT IT ONLINE.

05:51.952 --> 05:53.020
LET'S FACE IT.

05:53.053 --> 05:54.588
DEVIANCY HAS RUN AMOK
ON THE INTERNET.

05:54.622 --> 05:57.090
TEN YEARS AGO, ONLY FREAKS
KNEW WHERE TO GET SNUFF VIDEOS

05:57.124 --> 05:58.792
OR AMPUTEE PORN.

05:58.826 --> 06:00.994
NOW GRANDMA EMAILS
"TWO GIRLS, ONE CUP,"

06:01.028 --> 06:02.463
SIGNS IT "LOL."

06:02.496 --> 06:04.598
WELL, WHOEVER
THESE SCUMBAGS ARE,

06:04.632 --> 06:05.966
THEY'RE SMART ENOUGH NOT
TO SHOW THEIR FACES

06:05.999 --> 06:07.134
OR ANY LANDMARKS.

06:07.167 --> 06:08.436
BUT TOO STUPID TO REALIZE

06:08.469 --> 06:09.770
HOW SMART THEIR CELL PHONE
CAMERA IS.

06:09.803 --> 06:12.773
EVERY VIDEO THEY'VE POSTED
HAS A GEO-TAG.

06:12.806 --> 06:14.842
IT'S LIKE A MOTHER LODE
OF DATA.

06:14.875 --> 06:16.143
DATE AND TIME, F-STOP,

06:16.176 --> 06:18.011
EVEN GPS COORDINATES
WHERE IT WAS SHOT.

06:18.045 --> 06:18.946
IN THIS CASE,

06:18.979 --> 06:20.548
EVERY ATTACK LOCATION.

06:20.581 --> 06:21.615
DOES IT GIVE US
A PHONE NUMBER

06:21.649 --> 06:22.983
SO WE CAN TRACK DOWN
THE OWNER?

06:23.016 --> 06:24.652
NUMBERS CAN BE CHANGED

06:24.685 --> 06:26.520
AND THE STREET CLEANERS
KNOW ENOUGH TO DO THAT.

06:26.554 --> 06:29.022
BUT GEO TAGS GIVE US SOMETHING
UNCHANGEABLE.

06:29.056 --> 06:30.658
THE INTERNATIONAL MOBILE
IDENTITY NUMBER.

06:30.691 --> 06:33.594
IT'S LIKE A SERIAL NUMBER
FOR THE DEVICE.

06:33.627 --> 06:35.062
GIVES US EVERY CALL MADE
ON THEIR PHONE.

06:35.095 --> 06:37.798
INCLUDING A BUNCH MADE
THAT NIGHT A BLOCK AWAY

06:37.831 --> 06:39.467
FROM WHERE JOSH GALLI
GOT LIT UP.

06:39.500 --> 06:40.468
SO HOW DO WE FIND
THESE MORONS?

06:40.501 --> 06:41.735
OH, THEY'LL FIND YOU.

06:41.769 --> 06:43.704
THEY'VE GOT A CONCERNED
CITIZEN TIP LINE

06:43.737 --> 06:44.838
ON THEIR WEBSITE.

06:44.872 --> 06:46.607
(Stabler)
"GOT A PROBLEM?
LET US SOLVE IT."

06:46.640 --> 06:47.975
SO WE JUST INTRODUCE 'EM

06:48.008 --> 06:51.044
TO THE LAZIEST, FILTHIEST BUM
THEY'VE EVER SEEN.

06:51.078 --> 06:54.181
THEY'RE WATCHING US!
THE CIA!

06:54.214 --> 06:55.716
BRAIN WAVES!

06:55.749 --> 06:58.085
I GOTTA SAY,
THE MAN DOES CRAZY GOOD.

06:58.118 --> 06:59.019
GOOD?

06:59.052 --> 07:00.954
THIS IS THE SAME OLD CRAP
HE SAYS EVERY DAY,

07:00.988 --> 07:02.089
ONLY LOUDER.

07:02.122 --> 07:03.223
IT AIN'T WORKING EITHER.

07:03.256 --> 07:04.625
THERE AIN'T A DAMN
STREET CLEANER IN SIGHT.

07:04.658 --> 07:05.793
YEAH.

07:05.826 --> 07:07.027
(Munch)
THE ILLUMINATI ARE AFTER US

07:07.060 --> 07:09.463
OR THEY'RE AFTER YOU.

07:09.497 --> 07:11.765
NOBODY'S AFTER ME?
IS ANYBODY AFTER ME?

07:11.799 --> 07:14.768
YOU PICKED THE WRONG CORNER,
COCKROACH!

07:14.802 --> 07:15.769
POLICE!
DROP THE BAT!

07:15.803 --> 07:17.605
DROP THE BAT!

07:17.638 --> 07:19.139
DROP THE BAT!

07:20.841 --> 07:22.109
YOU'RE UNDER ARREST.

07:28.816 --> 07:30.918
WH--WHAT DID I DO?

07:30.951 --> 07:32.986
BESIDES SAVE THIS CITY
FROM THOSE VERMIN OUT THERE.

07:33.020 --> 07:34.522
THOSE VERMIN ARE PEOPLE.

07:34.555 --> 07:35.556
SARA, MAYBE WE SHOULDN'T SAY
ANYTHING--

07:35.589 --> 07:36.690
SHUT UP, SETH.

07:36.724 --> 07:38.492
JUST SIT THERE AND LOOK
LIKE THE DUMB ASS THAT YOU ARE.

07:38.526 --> 07:40.594
WHEN SOMEONE YOU LOVE

07:40.628 --> 07:42.563
GETS KILLED BY ONE
OF THOSE VERMIN,

07:42.596 --> 07:44.131
YOU GET A VOTE.

07:44.164 --> 07:45.899
TILL THEN,
SHUT YOUR UGLY FACE.

07:45.933 --> 07:46.967
GO BACK, GO BACK.

07:47.000 --> 07:49.703
GO BACK.
WHO GOT KILLED?

07:49.737 --> 07:50.638
LAST YEAR,

07:50.671 --> 07:54.508
MY FATHER WAS COMING HOME
ON THE SUBWAY.

07:54.542 --> 07:57.645
THEN THIS THING GETS ON.

07:57.678 --> 07:59.647
DIDN'T SAY A WORD.

07:59.680 --> 08:02.816
JUST SMASHED A BRICK
AGAINST MY DAD'S SKULL.

08:02.850 --> 08:03.817
HE WAS DEAD

08:03.851 --> 08:06.219
BEFORE HE HIT THE FLOOR.

08:06.253 --> 08:08.556
MY DAD WAS THE THIRD PERSON
THIS GUY ATTACKED.

08:08.589 --> 08:11.592
IT WAS THE 26TH TIME HE'D BEEN
IN AND OUT OF PRISON, OKAY?

08:11.625 --> 08:12.693
AND WHAT DID ANY OF YOU DO?

08:12.726 --> 08:13.694
YOU JUST SHUFFLE HIM
IN AND OUT

08:13.727 --> 08:15.095
OF HOSPITALS AND JAIL CELLS

08:15.128 --> 08:17.030
AND DIDN'T DO A DAMN THING
TO STOP HIM.

08:17.064 --> 08:22.069
SINCE YOU CAN'T DO YOUR JOB,
OKAY, I WILL!

08:22.102 --> 08:24.304
ANYTHING ELSE YOU WANT
TO CONFESS TO?

08:24.337 --> 08:27.007
WE GOT YOU FOR
THE VIDEO ASSAULTS.

08:27.040 --> 08:28.108
THE MURDER YOU'RE
ON THE HOOK FOR.

08:28.141 --> 08:31.078
W--WE NEVER MURDERED
ANYONE.

08:31.111 --> 08:32.846
LAST NIGHT A HOMELESS MAN
WAS CASTRATED

08:32.880 --> 08:34.181
AND SET ON FIRE
AND YOUR PHONE

08:34.214 --> 08:36.550
WAS THERE AT THE EXACT
SAME TIME.

08:36.584 --> 08:39.720
WHERE? AT THE MEATPACKING
DISTRICT?

08:39.753 --> 08:42.055
THAT'S FUNNY.
WE DIDN'T MENTION THAT.

08:42.089 --> 08:44.057
BECAUSE WE WERE THERE
AT THE BAR

08:44.091 --> 08:45.559
ON TOP OF THE GANSEVOORT HOTEL.

08:45.593 --> 08:48.128
WE WENT UP AT, LIKE, 10:00
AND CAME DOWN AT SUNRISE.

08:48.161 --> 08:49.663
SETH SHOOTS FOR PARTY PEOPLE.

08:49.697 --> 08:50.698
(Stabler)
WHO?

08:50.731 --> 08:52.032
PARTY PEOPLE.

08:52.065 --> 08:53.834
WE GOT TO BARS AND TAKE
SNAPSHOTS OF DRUNK IDIOTS.

08:53.867 --> 08:55.168
AND THE CAN BUY 'EM
OFF OUR WEBSITE.

08:55.202 --> 08:56.637
SARA WENT WITH ME LAST NIGHT.

08:56.670 --> 08:57.805
I GOT PRETTY WASTED.

08:57.838 --> 08:59.707
I ENDED UP BEING
IN MOST OF HIS SHOTS.

08:59.740 --> 09:04.612
SHOW 'EM YOUR PHONE,
SETH.

09:04.645 --> 09:06.013
RIGHT HERE, SEE?
SIT.

09:09.717 --> 09:11.251
LOOK AT THAT.

09:11.284 --> 09:13.754
1:20,

09:13.787 --> 09:15.222
1:19,

09:15.255 --> 09:17.124
1:17.

09:17.157 --> 09:19.192
JOSH DIED AT 1:17,
200 FEET BELOW.

09:19.226 --> 09:21.261
(Sara)
TOLD YOU WE DIDN'T DO IT.

09:21.294 --> 09:23.731
WISH WE HAD THOUGH.

09:23.764 --> 09:26.099
O'HALLORAN'S GOT SOMETHING
FOR US.

09:26.133 --> 09:28.636
HAVE FUN IN PRISON.

09:30.871 --> 09:31.739
WHADDAYA GOT FOR US?

09:31.772 --> 09:33.140
PUZZLING PIECES
FROM YOUR CRIME SCENE.

09:33.173 --> 09:35.375
ARSONISTS ALMOST ALWAYS
USE GASOLINE

09:35.408 --> 09:36.810
OR LIGHTER FLUID.

09:36.844 --> 09:38.245
JOSH GALLI'S KILLER
USED FORMALDEHYDE.

09:38.278 --> 09:39.346
THE STUFF
THAT PICKLES PEOPLE.

09:39.379 --> 09:40.648
BURNS 'EM TOO.

09:40.681 --> 09:42.315
FROM THE PUDDLING
AND SCORCH MARKS,

09:42.349 --> 09:44.184
I'D SAY OUR PERP
POURED TOO MUCH,

09:44.217 --> 09:45.819
MAYBE FUMBLED GETTING A SPARK.

09:45.853 --> 09:48.255
FUMES BUILT UP,
AND WHAMMO.

09:48.288 --> 09:50.157
SO OUR GUY MIGHT BE
A LITTLE CRISPY HIMSELF.

09:50.190 --> 09:53.661
I ALSO FOUND...THIS.

09:53.694 --> 09:55.028
(Stabler)
AN ELECTRIC MATCH.

09:55.062 --> 09:56.930
FLASH MUST'VE BLOWN IT
OUT OF THE PERP'S HAND

09:56.964 --> 09:58.098
INTO THE FLAMES.

09:58.131 --> 09:58.932
ORIGINALLY IT LOOKED LIKE THIS.

09:58.966 --> 10:00.400
(Stabler)
ANY WAY TO TRACE IT?

10:00.433 --> 10:02.269
WELL, THIS ONE HAS LETTERS
ENGRAVED

10:02.302 --> 10:03.270
ON THE BARREL, SEE?

10:03.303 --> 10:06.239
"PROPERTY OF

10:06.273 --> 10:09.176
B.H.H.S."

10:09.209 --> 10:11.611
BLESSED HEART HIGH SCHOOL.

10:14.114 --> 10:16.249
(man)
THE SCIENCE LAB
IS RIGHT THROUGH HERE.

10:16.283 --> 10:17.885
I'M MAX, BY THE WAY.

10:17.918 --> 10:19.086
NICE TO MEET YOU, MAX.

10:19.119 --> 10:20.954
THIS SCIENCE LAB,

10:20.988 --> 10:22.656
DOES EVERYONE HAVE ACCESS
TO IT?

10:22.690 --> 10:24.091
UH, DURING CLASS.

10:24.124 --> 10:26.159
OTHERWISE JUST OUR CHEM
TEACHER, SISTER ELIZABETH.

10:26.193 --> 10:27.995
AND ONE OF THE SENIORS,
ALEC BERNARDI.

10:28.028 --> 10:28.996
HE CLEANS UP,

10:29.029 --> 10:30.898
MAKES SURE ALL THE EQUIPMENT
IS ACCOUNTED FOR.

10:30.931 --> 10:31.899
HE GETS AN EXTRA CREDIT
FOR IT.

10:31.932 --> 10:33.901
SORT OF LIKE I DO
FOR BEING STUDENT ESCORT.

10:33.934 --> 10:35.135
ALEC A TRUSTWORTHY KID?

10:35.168 --> 10:38.205
I GUESS SO.
HE'S AN HONOR STUDENT.

10:38.238 --> 10:40.273
THEN AGAIN, HE'S NEVER JOINED
MY CLUB.

10:40.307 --> 10:41.842
CHASTITY CIRCLE.

10:41.875 --> 10:43.210
IN MY DAY, THEY CALLED THAT
THE A.V. CLUB.

10:43.243 --> 10:45.312
MY GIRLFRIEND AND I BOTH
BELONG.

10:45.345 --> 10:49.249
WE'VE MADE A COMMITMENT
TO SEXUAL ABSTINENCE.

10:49.282 --> 10:50.250
OH, HEY, UH,

10:50.283 --> 10:53.420
THERE'S ALEC RIGHT THERE.

10:53.453 --> 10:55.723
OKAY, UH, MAX,
WE DON'T NEED YOU ANYMORE.

10:55.756 --> 10:57.290
THANKS.

11:03.463 --> 11:05.966
WHOA, WHOA, ALEC,
SLOW DOWN, SLOW DOWN.

11:05.999 --> 11:07.167
I DIDN'T HEAR
ANY BELLS RINGING.

11:07.200 --> 11:09.136
YEAH, YOU'RE MOVING LIKE SOMEONE
LIT A FIRE UNDER YOUR ASS.

11:09.169 --> 11:11.038
UH, F-FIRE.

11:11.071 --> 11:12.706
I--I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING
ABOUT A FIRE.

11:12.740 --> 11:14.407
REALLY?

11:14.441 --> 11:16.443
HOW'D YOU BURN
YOUR HAND?

11:25.485 --> 11:26.920
[elevator dings]

11:26.954 --> 11:28.188
WELCOME BACK.

11:28.221 --> 11:29.823
THANKS.
HOW WAS THE CONFERENCE?

11:29.857 --> 11:30.791
THE USUAL.

11:30.824 --> 11:31.992
A LOT OF GOOD INFORMATION,
A LOT OF BAD COFFEE.

11:32.025 --> 11:32.926
ELLIOT AND JOHN HAVE

11:32.960 --> 11:34.895
AN INTERESTING SUSPECT
IN INTERROGATION.

11:34.928 --> 11:35.896
YOU WANNA WATCH?

11:35.929 --> 11:38.398
IT'S WHAT I LIVE FOR.

11:38.431 --> 11:39.933
HEY, WHO'S IN CHARGE HERE?

11:39.967 --> 11:41.969
CAN I HELP YOU?

11:42.002 --> 11:43.003
YOU GOT MY BOY.

11:43.036 --> 11:44.004
I WANT TO SEE HIM.

11:44.037 --> 11:45.205
WHAT'S HIS NAME?

11:45.238 --> 11:46.239
WHAT'S YOUR NAME?

11:46.273 --> 11:48.876
DONALD CRAGEN,
CAPTAIN OF SVU.

11:48.909 --> 11:50.277
HIS NAME IS ALEC BERNARDI.

11:50.310 --> 11:51.311
MISS BERNARDI,

11:51.344 --> 11:52.913
YOUR SON IS IN CUSTODY.

11:52.946 --> 11:54.815
YOU CAN SEE HIM AFTER
WE'RE DONE QUESTIONING HIM.

11:54.848 --> 11:56.383
YOU CAN'T DO THAT
WITHOUT ME THERE.

11:56.416 --> 11:58.451
HE'S OVER 16,
SO YES, WE CAN.

11:58.485 --> 11:59.452
ALEC WAS READ HIS RIGHTS

11:59.486 --> 12:00.487
AND HE DECLINED A LAWYER.

12:00.520 --> 12:01.488
HE'S JUST A KID!

12:01.521 --> 12:02.856
WHAT THE HELL DOES HE KNOW?

12:02.890 --> 12:03.857
COME ON,
I WANT TO SEE HIM NOW.

12:03.891 --> 12:05.092
HE MUST BE SCARED TO DEATH.

12:05.125 --> 12:07.828
SCARED--
NOT THE WORD I'D USE.

12:07.861 --> 12:09.797
I'M PROUD OF WHAT I DID.

12:09.830 --> 12:11.464
(Stabler)
YOU MURDERED
A MENTALLY ILL MAN.

12:11.498 --> 12:13.200
(Munch)
THE GUY WAS HIGH AS A KITE.

12:13.233 --> 12:14.868
IT WASN'T EVEN A FAIR FIGHT.

12:14.902 --> 12:16.136
WELL, JOSH HAD IT COMING.

12:16.169 --> 12:17.004
OH, YOU KNEW HIM?

12:17.037 --> 12:18.405
HE USED TO LIVE
IN MY NEIGHBORHOOD,

12:18.438 --> 12:19.873
BUT I DIDN'T MEAN TO KILL HIM.

12:19.907 --> 12:20.941
YOU STOCKED UP ON WEAPONS

12:20.974 --> 12:22.409
FROM YOUR SCHOOL
SCIENCE LAB.

12:22.442 --> 12:25.012
YOU HUNTED HIM DOWN.
WE CALL THAT INTENT.

12:25.045 --> 12:26.013
YEAH, WELL, YOU KNOW,

12:26.046 --> 12:27.214
I--I'D CALL THAT HONOR.

12:27.247 --> 12:29.116
KID'S GOT A WAY
OF TWISTING WORDS.

12:29.149 --> 12:31.051
MOM OUT THERE
IS IN FOR A SHOCK.

12:31.084 --> 12:34.054
[Alec over speaker]
I'M TELLING YOU
IT WAS AN ACCIDENT. OKAY?

12:34.087 --> 12:35.889
AND I DIDN'T GO HUNTING JOSH.

12:35.923 --> 12:38.091
I SAW HIM HANGING OUT
IN THE MEATPACKING DISTRICT

12:38.125 --> 12:39.860
A COUPLE OF TIMES.

12:39.893 --> 12:43.096
LOOK, I ONLY TOOK THAT STUFF
FROM THE SCHOOL TO SCARE HIM.

12:43.130 --> 12:45.132
NOT TO KILL HIM.

12:45.165 --> 12:47.000
THEN--THEN HE PUNCHED ME.

12:47.034 --> 12:49.169
GRABBED FOR THE SCALPEL AND--

12:49.202 --> 12:50.938
I--I STARTED TO STAB HIM.

12:50.971 --> 12:53.073
IN THE GENITALS.
THAT WAS NO ACCIDENT.

12:53.106 --> 12:54.407
IT JUST GOT OUT OF CONTROL.

12:54.441 --> 12:57.010
YOU WERE IN CONTROL ENOUGH
WHEN YOU SET HIM ON FIRE.

12:57.044 --> 12:59.079
I ONLY DID WHAT MY DAD
WOULD'VE DONE.

12:59.112 --> 13:01.181
HE WOULD'VE BEEN PROUD OF ME.

13:01.214 --> 13:03.183
I'D LIKE TO MEET
THE OLD MAN

13:03.216 --> 13:03.884
WHO GIVES HIS KID
A PAT ON THE BACK

13:03.917 --> 13:05.853
FOR DOING SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

13:05.886 --> 13:08.021
YEAH, WELL,
HE'S NOT AROUND ANYMORE.

13:08.055 --> 13:10.157
BUT, YOU KNOW,
IF HE FOUND OUT

13:10.190 --> 13:11.191
WHAT JOSH DID--

13:11.224 --> 13:12.125
YEAH, WHAT DID HE DO?

13:12.159 --> 13:16.229
HE RAPED MY SISTER
AND GOT HER PREGNANT!

13:16.263 --> 13:20.533
THAT'S WHY I CUT
HIS BALLS OFF!

13:25.072 --> 13:26.273
NOW CAN I SEE MY BOY?

13:26.306 --> 13:27.875
NOT YET.

13:27.908 --> 13:29.042
FIRST WE NEED TO SPEAK
WITH YOUR DAUGHTER.

13:29.076 --> 13:31.111
TINA?
WHY?

13:31.144 --> 13:32.379
HE RAPED ME?

13:32.412 --> 13:34.147
NO ONE RAPED ME.

13:34.181 --> 13:35.883
TINA, I KNOW HOW DIFFICULT
THIS IS TO ADMIT.

13:35.916 --> 13:37.484
YOU WANT TO FORGET
THAT IT EVER HAPPENED.

13:37.517 --> 13:40.120
MAYBE--MAYBE YOU EVEN BLAME
YOURSELF--

13:40.153 --> 13:41.955
I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING.
NEITHER DID JOSH.

13:41.989 --> 13:43.590
TINA, YOU NEED TO GO
TO A DOCTOR.

13:43.623 --> 13:45.358
YOU NEED TO BE TESTED
FOR STDs.

13:45.392 --> 13:46.459
THESE ARE DISEASES
THAT MAY--

13:46.493 --> 13:47.895
MAY HURT YOU AND YOUR BABY.

13:47.928 --> 13:53.066
BABY?
WHAT IS SHE TALKING ABOUT?

13:53.100 --> 13:54.067
MOM.

13:54.101 --> 13:55.335
WHAT DOES SHE MEAN "BABY"?

13:55.368 --> 13:57.070
[scoffs]

13:57.104 --> 13:59.206
TINA, YOU NEED TO TELL US.

13:59.239 --> 14:01.074
CHRISTINA DIVOLA BERNARDI,

14:01.108 --> 14:02.943
I ASKED YOU A QUESTION!

14:02.976 --> 14:07.114
WOULD BOTH OF YOU JUST STOP!

14:07.147 --> 14:09.116
[sighs]

14:12.152 --> 14:14.087
THAT GALLI KID
DID THIS TO YOU?

14:14.121 --> 14:15.122
I'M GONNA KILL
THE LITTLE BASTARD!

14:15.155 --> 14:16.056
OH, MY GOD!

14:16.089 --> 14:17.324
YOUR SON ALREADY BEAT YOU
TO THE PUNCH.

14:17.357 --> 14:18.325
MY SON DIDN'T DO ANYTHING--

14:18.358 --> 14:19.392
NEITHER OF YOU GET IT!

14:19.426 --> 14:22.095
JOSH DIDN'T RAPE ME.
WE HAD SEX!

14:22.129 --> 14:23.396
IT WAS--WHAT DO YOU CALL IT,
CONSENSUAL?

14:23.430 --> 14:25.298
OH, MY GOD.

14:25.332 --> 14:26.633
TINA, WHY DOES YOUR BROTHER
THINK

14:26.666 --> 14:28.001
THAT JOSH RAPED YOU?

14:28.035 --> 14:29.002
BECAUSE HE'S AN IDIOT.

14:29.036 --> 14:32.906
THE OTHER DAY,
I WAS...

14:32.940 --> 14:34.174
I WAS ON THE PHONE
WITH BIANCA

14:34.207 --> 14:37.510
AND I MADE A JOKE
ABOUT JOSH DOING ME.

14:37.544 --> 14:39.179
ALEC WAS THERE.
HE MUST'VE MISUNDERSTOOD.

14:39.212 --> 14:40.280
YEAH, BUT--

14:40.313 --> 14:41.548
I--I'M STILL MISUNDERSTANDING.

14:41.581 --> 14:43.650
TINA, I NEED YOU TO TELL ME

14:43.683 --> 14:46.519
WHAT HAPPENED WITH JOSH.

14:50.323 --> 14:53.260
IT WAS THREE MONTHS AGO.

14:53.293 --> 14:55.195
AND I SAW JOSH UPSTAIRS

14:55.228 --> 14:57.197
COMING OUT OF
HIS DAD'S PLACE.

14:57.230 --> 14:59.266
I KNOW JOSH GETS SICK
SOMETIMES AND WANDERS OFF.

14:59.299 --> 15:01.434
BUT HE WAS BETTER.

15:01.468 --> 15:03.971
TALKING NORMAL.

15:04.004 --> 15:06.706
HE LOOKED GOOD.

15:06.739 --> 15:10.310
HE SAID I LOOKED GOOD.

15:10.343 --> 15:12.312
AND I ALWAYS HAD A CRUSH
ON HIM FROM WHEN I WAS LITTLE.

15:12.345 --> 15:13.947
YOU'RE STILL LITTLE!

15:13.981 --> 15:16.083
AND NOW YOU'RE KNOCKED UP
BY A NUTCASE!

15:16.116 --> 15:19.152
MRS. BERNARDI, PLEASE.

15:19.186 --> 15:20.320
GO ON.

15:20.353 --> 15:23.290
WE WENT UP TO THE ROOF.

15:23.323 --> 15:24.624
WE TALKED FOR A WHILE.

15:24.657 --> 15:27.260
HE HAD A BOTTLE FROM HIS DAD'S
LIQUOR CABINET.

15:27.294 --> 15:28.161
IT--IT JUST HAPPENED.

15:28.195 --> 15:29.296
WITHOUT A CONDOM.

15:29.329 --> 15:32.465
HE SAID HE COULD GO GET ONE.

15:32.499 --> 15:34.167
BUT I TOLD HIM NOT TO.

15:34.201 --> 15:35.168
WHAT DID YOU JUST SAY?

15:35.202 --> 15:36.169
YOU WANTED TO GET PREGNANT?

15:36.203 --> 15:39.706
YEAH.

15:39.739 --> 15:41.174
WE ALL DID.

15:41.208 --> 15:42.375
(Carlotta)
WE GREW UP TOGETHER.

15:42.409 --> 15:44.744
NOW WE'RE GONNA HAVE KIDS
TOGETHER.

15:44.777 --> 15:46.346
HOW SWEET IS THAT?

15:46.379 --> 15:47.547
(Benson)
AND THE BABY'S FATHER?

15:47.580 --> 15:49.116
THIS IS ABOUT US.

15:49.149 --> 15:50.150
YOU'RE IN SCHOOL.

15:50.183 --> 15:52.219
CATHOLIC SCHOOL.

15:52.252 --> 15:53.486
IF THEY KICK US OUT,
WE'LL GET JOBS.

15:53.520 --> 15:55.055
(Bianca)
OUR PARENTS WILL TOTALLY
HELP US.

15:55.088 --> 15:59.492
RIGHT, DAD?

15:59.526 --> 16:01.161
OR I'LL GO ON WELFARE.

16:01.194 --> 16:02.229
(Carlotta)
WHAT'S THE BIG DEAL?

16:02.262 --> 16:03.263
THAT VICE PRESIDENT LADY'S
DAUGHTER

16:03.296 --> 16:04.597
IS GONNA HAVE A BABY.

16:04.631 --> 16:06.766
YEAH, WHY CAN'T WE?

16:06.799 --> 16:08.635
JOSH SUFFERED FROM
SCHIZOPHRENIA.

16:08.668 --> 16:10.303
YOU'RE NOT WORRIED
THAT YOUR BABY

16:10.337 --> 16:11.504
IS GONNA BE
PREDISPOSED TO IT?

16:11.538 --> 16:14.307
NO WAY.

16:14.341 --> 16:16.209
WHAT DOES PREDISPOSED MEAN?

16:16.243 --> 16:17.210
WHOSE IDEA WAS THIS?

16:17.244 --> 16:18.211
FIDELIA'S.

16:18.245 --> 16:19.312
FIDELIA'S.

16:19.346 --> 16:21.481
SHE GOT PREGNANT FIRST.

16:21.514 --> 16:23.283
SAID WE ALL SHOULD.

16:23.316 --> 16:25.118
YEAH, IT WAS MY IDEA.

16:25.152 --> 16:26.219
IT ROCKS, HUH?

16:26.253 --> 16:28.655
WE'RE TOTALLY GONNA BE
THE HOTTEST MILFS ON THE BLOCK.

16:28.688 --> 16:29.656
MILFS?

16:29.689 --> 16:31.291
IT MEANS MOTHER I'D LIKE TO--

16:31.324 --> 16:33.326
OH, I KNOW WHAT IT MEANS.

16:33.360 --> 16:34.327
WANNA SEE THE STROLLER
I PICKED OUT?

16:34.361 --> 16:37.497
IT'S SO CUTE.

16:37.530 --> 16:39.132
FIDELIA,

16:39.166 --> 16:40.500
YOU NEED TO SCREW YOUR HEAD
ON STRAIGHT.

16:40.533 --> 16:41.701
THIS IS A BABY
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT.

16:41.734 --> 16:43.536
NOT A NEW SHADE OF LIPSTICK.

16:43.570 --> 16:44.671
DON'T SAY ANOTHER WORD,
ANGEL.

16:44.704 --> 16:46.506
ARE YOU CHARGING MY DAUGHTER
WITH SOMETHING, DETECTIVE?

16:46.539 --> 16:48.408
BECAUSE I DON'T LIKE
YOUR TONE.

16:48.441 --> 16:49.442
I'M JUST HERE TO ASK
A FEW QUESTIONS,

16:49.476 --> 16:50.643
MR. VIDAL.

16:50.677 --> 16:52.379
DADDY, LET HER ASK.
I'M FINE.

16:52.412 --> 16:54.681
GOOD.

16:58.218 --> 16:59.352
FIDELIA, WHY DON'T WE TALK

16:59.386 --> 17:01.154
ABOUT THE FATHER OF THE BABY,
HUH?

17:01.188 --> 17:02.522
SO WHAT'S YOUR STORY?

17:02.555 --> 17:04.124
EXCUSE ME?

17:04.157 --> 17:06.259
YOU HAVE KIDS?
YOU'RE PRETTY OLD.

17:06.293 --> 17:07.827
WE'RE HERE TO TALK ABOUT YOU.

17:07.860 --> 17:09.162
I BET YOU'RE JEALOUS.

17:09.196 --> 17:13.100
OLD CHICKS ARE TOTALLY
JEALOUS OF ME.

17:13.133 --> 17:15.102
IS THAT IT?

17:15.135 --> 17:16.603
DID YOU WAIT TOO LONG?

17:16.636 --> 17:18.438
TICK TOCK.

17:18.471 --> 17:19.672
FIDELIA,

17:19.706 --> 17:21.741
A BABY IS NOT AN ACCESSORY.

17:21.774 --> 17:23.710
IT IS NOT A BRACELET
OR A PAIR OF EARRINGS

17:23.743 --> 17:25.578
OR A SLAMMIN' PAIR
OF JEANS.

17:25.612 --> 17:27.614
THIS IS A LIVING,
BREATHING HUMAN BEING

17:27.647 --> 17:29.349
THAT YOU ARE BRINGING
ONTO THIS EARTH.

17:29.382 --> 17:30.350
YOU THINK I DON'T KNOW THAT?

17:30.383 --> 17:31.618
IF YOU DID,

17:31.651 --> 17:33.520
YOU'D BE PETRIFIED
ABOUT YOUR FUTURE.

17:33.553 --> 17:35.455
DO YOU KNOW THE ODDS
OF A TEEN MOM

17:35.488 --> 17:36.556
FINISHING HIGH SCHOOL?

17:36.589 --> 17:39.592
FORGET COLLEGE OR ANY OTHER
DREAM THAT YOU MIGHT HAVE.

17:39.626 --> 17:43.363
LIFE AS YOU KNOW IT
IS OVER NOW.

17:43.396 --> 17:44.797
THERE'S NO GOING TO THE MALL

17:44.831 --> 17:46.466
OR HANGING OUT
WITH YOUR FRIENDS.

17:46.499 --> 17:47.700
I MEAN, YOU MIGHT SEE THEM.

17:47.734 --> 17:49.436
BUT IF YOU DO IT'LL PROBABLY
BE IN LINE

17:49.469 --> 17:51.371
WAITING FOR FOOD STAMPS

17:51.404 --> 17:52.372
OR ALL OF YOU GOING
TO THE DOCTOR,

17:52.405 --> 17:54.241
TRYING TO GET AN APPOINTMENT
AT THE FREE CLINIC.

17:54.274 --> 17:55.708
DADDY, MAKE HER BE QUIET!

17:55.742 --> 17:56.709
THAT'S ENOUGH, DETECTIVE.

17:56.743 --> 17:58.711
DO YOU KNOW THE HEALTH RISKS

17:58.745 --> 18:00.180
TO BABIES OF TEEN MOMS?

18:00.213 --> 18:02.382
DYSLEXIA, RETARDATION,

18:02.415 --> 18:03.383
UM, INCREASED RISKS

18:03.416 --> 18:05.285
OF BLINDNESS,
CEREBRAL PALSY--

18:05.318 --> 18:06.419
DADDY!

18:06.453 --> 18:08.288
DON'T YOU TRY
TO BLAME MY DAUGHTER.

18:08.321 --> 18:09.456
SHE'S JUST A CHILD.

18:09.489 --> 18:11.391
THAT'S MY POINT EXACTLY.

18:11.424 --> 18:13.260
OH, YEAH?

18:13.293 --> 18:14.861
WHAT ABOUT THE KID
THAT KNOCKED HER UP, HUH?
[banging on door]

18:14.894 --> 18:19.699
FIDELIA...

18:19.732 --> 18:22.802
IS IT TRUE?

18:22.835 --> 18:24.337
YES.

18:24.371 --> 18:29.309
I WAS GONNA TELL YOU.

18:29.342 --> 18:31.344
WE MADE A COMMITMENT
TO EACH OTHER.

18:31.378 --> 18:33.613
TO GOD.

18:33.646 --> 18:36.449
YOU WERE SUPPOSED TO BE
MY FIRST, TRUE WIFE.

18:36.483 --> 18:38.251
I WAS SUPPOSED TO BE
YOUR FIRST, TRUE HUSBAND.

18:38.285 --> 18:41.288
[sobbing]

18:44.691 --> 18:48.461
IT'S OKAY.
I STILL LOVE YOU.

18:48.495 --> 18:50.863
IT'S OKAY. SHH.

18:50.897 --> 18:53.933
[crying]

18:53.966 --> 18:58.405
EVEN CHRISTIANS MAKE MISTAKES.

19:01.441 --> 19:02.875
ANY OTHER CANDIDATES?

19:06.913 --> 19:10.517
SO FOUR TEENAGE GIRLS MAKE
A PACT TO GET PREGNANT

19:10.550 --> 19:11.884
AND THEN JUST LAUGH
ABOUT IT?

19:11.918 --> 19:13.320
DOESN'T SOUND LIKE FIDELIA
WAS LAUGHING

19:13.353 --> 19:14.687
WHEN LIV GOT DONE WITH HER.

19:14.721 --> 19:16.589
I MAY'VE DROPPED THE HAMMER
A LITTLE TOO HARD.

19:16.623 --> 19:18.825
WELL, THE GIRL COULD USE
ALL THE REALITY SHE CAN GET.

19:18.858 --> 19:20.327
I'LL BET SHE'S NOT GETTING IT

19:20.360 --> 19:22.329
FROM THE NUNS AT SCHOOL
OR THE CHASTITY CIRCLE.

19:22.362 --> 19:23.129
WOULDN'T HAVE MATTERED ANYWAY.

19:23.162 --> 19:24.063
THESE GIRLS WANTED
TO GET PREGNANT.

19:24.096 --> 19:25.832
AND THEIR PARENTS
WEREN'T MUCH HELP EITHER.

19:25.865 --> 19:28.268
SOME OF THESE APPLES
DIDN'T FALL FAR FROM THE TREE.

19:28.301 --> 19:30.303
ANY IDEA WHAT THEIR PLANS ARE?

19:30.337 --> 19:31.471
OH, THEY'RE ALL GONNA HAVE
THEIR KIDS.

19:31.504 --> 19:32.839
WELL, THERE'S NO NEED
TO TURN A MISTAKE

19:32.872 --> 19:34.474
INTO A BIGGER MISTAKE.

19:34.507 --> 19:35.575
BABIES HAVING BABIES
DOESN'T BOTHER YOU?

19:35.608 --> 19:37.577
BABIES KILLING BABIES
BOTHERS ME.

19:37.610 --> 19:39.446
SO IT'S THAT EASY,
HUH, ALTAR BOY?

19:39.479 --> 19:40.580
WELL, THERE'S NO RAPE
OR INCEST,

19:40.613 --> 19:41.381
SO YEAH, IT IS THAT EASY.

19:41.414 --> 19:42.949
THERE'S A THING CALLED
ADOPTION.

19:42.982 --> 19:44.784
WELL, IT'S OFF OUR PLATE NOW.
THERE'S NO CRIME HERE.

19:44.817 --> 19:46.586
(Greylek)
UH, I'M NOT SO SURE
ABOUT THAT.

19:46.619 --> 19:48.688
ALL FOUR GIRLS
ARE UNDER THE AGE OF CONSENT.

19:48.721 --> 19:50.690
JOSH GALLI WOULD'VE GONE DOWN

19:50.723 --> 19:51.891
FOR HAVING SEX
WITH TINA BERNARDI.

19:51.924 --> 19:53.260
HOW OLD ARE THE OTHER DADS?

19:53.293 --> 19:55.462
WELL, BIANCA AND CARLOTTA
GOT PREGNANT

19:55.495 --> 19:57.297
BY BOYS IN THEIR CLASS,
BOTH MINORS.

19:57.330 --> 19:58.331
SO THEY CAN'T BE CHARGED.

19:58.365 --> 19:59.499
AND LIKE KIM SAID,

19:59.532 --> 20:00.633
WE COULD'VE GONE AFTER
JOSH GALLI,

20:00.667 --> 20:02.935
EXCEPT HE'S DEAD.

20:02.969 --> 20:03.970
WHICH LEAVES US ONLY

20:04.003 --> 20:05.938
WITH OUR LITTLE RING LEADER,
FIDELIA VIDAL,

20:05.972 --> 20:08.808
WHO THINKS THAT THE GUY
WHO GOT HER PREGNANT IS 22.

20:08.841 --> 20:09.809
THINKS?

20:09.842 --> 20:10.877
OH, SHE'S ONLY MET HIM ONCE.

20:10.910 --> 20:12.011
DOESN'T KNOW HIS REAL NAME.

20:12.044 --> 20:14.247
ONLY HIS STREET NAME,
"DIZZER."

20:14.281 --> 20:15.548
GOOFY NAME OR NOT,

20:15.582 --> 20:17.750
IF HE'S OVER 18,
WE CAN CHARGE STATUTORY RAPE.

20:17.784 --> 20:18.585
WAIT A MINUTE,
WAIT A MINUTE.

20:18.618 --> 20:19.786
I THOUGHT THIS, UH,
[phone rings]

20:19.819 --> 20:21.888
MAX KID WAS FIDELIA'S BOYFRIEND.

20:21.921 --> 20:22.922
SO DID HE.

20:22.955 --> 20:23.790
FIDELIA MET DIZZER

20:23.823 --> 20:25.625
AT A HOUSE PARTY
THAT HE WAS DEEJAYING.

20:25.658 --> 20:28.595
THEY SNUCK AWAY,
GOT HIGH, AND GOT BUSY.

20:28.628 --> 20:30.597
NO JUDGE WOULD ORDER
A PATERNITY TEST ON A FETUS.

20:30.630 --> 20:32.499
WE NEED A PARENT
TO FILE CHARGES.

20:32.532 --> 20:34.434
SOUNDS LIKE FIDELIA'S DAD

20:34.467 --> 20:36.403
IS ALREADY ON THE WARPATH.

20:36.436 --> 20:37.537
CHECK THIS OUT.

20:37.570 --> 20:38.771
[on TV]
THIS ISN'T ABOUT WHAT A GROUP

20:38.805 --> 20:40.873
OF YOUNG, VULNERABLE GIRLS
MIGHT'VE DONE.

20:40.907 --> 20:43.410
IT'S ABOUT A CULTURE
THAT SEXUALIZES KIDS

20:43.443 --> 20:44.711
AT A YOUNGER AND YOUNGER AGE.

20:44.744 --> 20:46.579
AND THE POLICE WHO DO NOTHING

20:46.613 --> 20:49.582
TO PROTECT OUR DAUGHTERS
AGAINST MALE PREDATORS.

20:49.616 --> 20:51.418
I JUST FOUND OUT THE MAN
THAT IMPREGNATED MY DAUGHTER

20:51.451 --> 20:52.452
IS 22 YEARS OLD.

20:52.485 --> 20:53.886
22 YEARS OLD!

20:53.920 --> 20:54.887
WHAT ARE THE POLICE DOING?

20:54.921 --> 20:55.888
NOTHING.

20:55.922 --> 20:57.357
WELL, THAT'S GREAT.

20:57.390 --> 20:58.891
IN BLOWS HURRICANE VIDAL
AND WE DON'T EVEN KNOW

20:58.925 --> 21:00.593
THE NAME OF THE KID
WE'RE LOOKING FOR.

21:00.627 --> 21:02.595
SEEK AND YE SHALL FIND,
MY CAPTAIN.

21:02.629 --> 21:04.731
DOING A LITTLE DIGGING
IN THE CARS DATABASE

21:04.764 --> 21:07.700
OF CRIMINAL ALIASES
AND WHO POPS UP

21:07.734 --> 21:09.669
BUT A YOUNG MAN
NAMED DIZZER,

21:09.702 --> 21:12.305
AKA DONALD ZUCCHO.

21:15.675 --> 21:16.776
(Stabler)
DON ZUCCHO.

21:16.809 --> 21:19.011
YO, YO, NAME'S DIZZER.
WHAT UP?

21:19.045 --> 21:20.847
[scoffs]

21:20.880 --> 21:21.881
UH-OH.

21:21.914 --> 21:23.650
IT'S THE PO-PO.

21:23.683 --> 21:24.751
WHAT Y'ALL LOOKIN' FOR,

21:24.784 --> 21:26.319
A COPY OF
I SHOT THE SHERIFF?

21:26.353 --> 21:27.587
HA, NO.

21:27.620 --> 21:28.588
WE'RE ACTUALLY LOOKING
FOR YOU TO TELL US

21:28.621 --> 21:29.689
ABOUT FIDELIA VIDAL.

21:29.722 --> 21:30.690
WHO?

21:30.723 --> 21:31.758
THE SWEET LITTLE THING
YOU TAPPED

21:31.791 --> 21:33.526
IN BENSONHURST LAST SUMMER.

21:33.560 --> 21:34.561
SON, YOU GONNA HAVE
TO BE MORE SPECIFIC,

21:34.594 --> 21:35.695
A'IGHT?

21:35.728 --> 21:37.730
'CAUSE MY MOTTO IS...

21:37.764 --> 21:39.799
WRECKIN' DECKS
AND GETTIN' SEX.

21:39.832 --> 21:40.933
YOU KNOW WHAT'S UP,
DON'T YOU, MY BROTHER?

21:43.069 --> 21:44.103
SHE'S ABOUT TO HAVE A BABY.

21:44.136 --> 21:45.772
YOURS.

21:45.805 --> 21:47.039
YO, TELL HER TO GET IN LINE.

21:47.073 --> 21:48.641
I ALREADY GOT TWO.

21:48.675 --> 21:50.343
YOU MAKE CHILD SUPPORT
BY SPINNING RECORDS

21:50.377 --> 21:51.578
AND WORKING IN THIS DUMP?

21:51.611 --> 21:52.879
CHILD SUPPORT?

21:52.912 --> 21:54.381
[laughs]

21:54.414 --> 21:56.048
BABY MAMAS' JUST HAPPY
THEIR KIDS LOOK LIKE ME.

21:56.082 --> 21:58.418
WELL, FIDELIA'S DAD
WANTS MORE.

21:58.451 --> 21:59.852
WELL, FOOL SHOULD WANT
TO KEEP HIS TEEFS.

21:59.886 --> 22:00.987
YOU JUST THREATEN HIM?

22:01.020 --> 22:03.723
AND THE WORD'S "TEETH."

22:03.756 --> 22:04.891
RIGHT.

22:04.924 --> 22:06.058
DNA WARRANT.

22:06.092 --> 22:07.694
PULL YOUR PANTS UP
AND GET YOUR ASS DOWN

22:07.727 --> 22:09.128
TO THE MEDICAL EXAMINER'S
OFFICE.

22:09.161 --> 22:12.732
JUST GOT TOUCHED,
MY BROTHER.

22:12.765 --> 22:15.668
MR. VIDAL,
THOUGHT YOU SHOULD KNOW

22:15.702 --> 22:16.936
WE JUST SLAPPED
A COURT ORDER ON THE FATHER

22:16.969 --> 22:18.571
OF YOUR UPCOMING GRANDCHILD.

22:18.605 --> 22:19.672
HE'S GONE FOR A PATERNITY TEST.

22:19.706 --> 22:21.741
IT'S ABOUT TIME.

22:21.774 --> 22:23.576
WELL, YOUR DAUGHTER'LL NEED
TO HAVE AN AMNIOCENTESIS

22:23.610 --> 22:25.011
SO WE CAN MAKE A MATCH.

22:25.044 --> 22:26.613
OTHERWISE YOU'LL HAVE TO WAIT
UNTIL THE BABY IS BORN.

22:26.646 --> 22:28.948
WE HAVE A DOCTOR ON CALL
AT MERCY HOSPITAL.

22:28.981 --> 22:30.817
LET'S TAKE HER NOW.

22:30.850 --> 22:32.852
ANGEL, WOULD YOU COME OUT HERE
PLEASE?

22:36.823 --> 22:38.425
SWEETIE--

22:38.458 --> 22:39.926
WHAT'S OUR RULE?
NO LOCKED DOORS.

22:39.959 --> 22:41.428
COME OUT HERE RIGHT NOW.
[rattles doorknob]

22:41.461 --> 22:43.430
YOU'RE GOING TO THE DOCTOR.

22:43.463 --> 22:46.466
FIDELIA, OPEN THIS DOOR.

22:47.467 --> 22:49.135
OW.

22:49.168 --> 22:51.638
I HAVE A BUM SHOULDER.
WOULD YOU MIND?

22:51.671 --> 22:53.105
AS LONG AS YOU DON'T SUE
FOR DAMAGES.

22:53.139 --> 22:55.508
ANGEL, YOU BETTER BE DECENT.

22:59.812 --> 23:01.147
[Isabella screams]
NO!

23:01.180 --> 23:02.649
NO!
NO!

23:02.682 --> 23:04.584
OH, MY GOD!

23:04.617 --> 23:07.554
[crying]

23:07.587 --> 23:08.588
AAH!

23:17.597 --> 23:19.832
WHY WOULD SHE DO THIS?
WHY WOULD SHE DO THIS?

23:19.866 --> 23:22.569
IT'S OKAY, IT'S OKAY.

23:22.602 --> 23:24.070
IT'S ALL RIGHT.

23:27.674 --> 23:30.643
MRS. VIDAL,
WE'RE SORRY ABOUT YOUR LOSS.

23:32.011 --> 23:34.614
I KNOW WHY.

23:34.647 --> 23:36.716
I KNOW WHY SHE DID IT.

23:36.749 --> 23:38.851
MA'AM?

23:38.885 --> 23:42.755
SOMEONE MADE MY BABY
KILL HERSELF.

23:42.789 --> 23:43.890
THEY DROVE HER TO IT.

23:43.923 --> 23:45.157
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

23:45.191 --> 23:48.961
LAST NIGHT,
SOMEONE STARTED EMAILING HER.

23:48.995 --> 23:52.098
THEY WERE CALLING HER
A SLUT AND A WHORE.

23:52.131 --> 23:53.099
SHE WAS CRYING.

23:53.132 --> 23:54.133
THEY WOULDN'T LEAVE HER ALONE.

23:54.166 --> 23:55.868
WHERE IS THE COMPUTER?

23:55.902 --> 23:57.169
IN THE DEN USUALLY.

23:57.203 --> 24:00.907
WE DON'T LET FIDELIA
HAVE ONE IN HER ROOM.

24:00.940 --> 24:03.610
BUT LAST NIGHT,
ME AND GORDON,

24:03.643 --> 24:05.778
WE WERE FIGHTING AND...

24:05.812 --> 24:09.649
WE WERE SCREAMING AND YELLING.

24:09.682 --> 24:11.183
AND WE WERE BOTH DRINKING.

24:11.217 --> 24:13.653
AND I TOLD FIDELIA
TO GO TO HER ROOM

24:13.686 --> 24:15.622
AND SHE TOOK THE LAPTOP
WITH HER.

24:15.655 --> 24:16.923
MRS. VIDAL,
WE NEED TO SEE IT.

24:16.956 --> 24:17.924
WHERE IS IT?

24:17.957 --> 24:20.560
WHY DIDN'T I GO HELP HER?

24:20.593 --> 24:23.262
I HEARD HER CRYING AND I--

24:23.295 --> 24:25.532
ALL I DID WAS POUR MYSELF
ANOTHER DRINK.

24:25.565 --> 24:28.034
[crying]

24:28.067 --> 24:30.570
WHY DIDN'T I HELP HER?
I JUST HAD ANOTHER DRINK.

24:30.603 --> 24:31.638
WHY DIDN'T I HELP HER?

24:31.671 --> 24:32.939
WHERE'S THE FAMILY COMPUTER?

24:32.972 --> 24:34.841
INSIDE.

24:36.909 --> 24:38.678
"DIZZER4EVER?"

24:38.711 --> 24:39.879
FRICKIN' LAME-O.

24:39.912 --> 24:41.013
WELL, THAT'S WHO
WAS TAUNTING HER

24:41.047 --> 24:42.014
ALL LAST NIGHT.

24:42.048 --> 24:43.249
WE GOT IT OFF HER COMPUTER.

24:43.282 --> 24:45.084
"UR A DUMB WHORE.

24:45.117 --> 24:46.953
HOW DUMB DO YOU THINK
THAT BABY WILL B?"

24:46.986 --> 24:48.821
"EVERYONE HATES YOU
SO STFU.

24:48.855 --> 24:50.222
"LOL.

24:50.256 --> 24:52.124
"THE WORLD DOESN'T NEED YOU,
SLUT.

24:52.158 --> 24:53.225
END IT.
END IT NOW."

24:53.259 --> 24:55.662
AND SHE RESPONDS
"U R SO MEAN.

24:55.695 --> 24:57.530
FORGET IT, FATH IS KNOCKING.
GOTTA GO."

24:57.564 --> 24:58.798
SO SHE SIGNED OFF WITH YOU

24:58.831 --> 25:00.266
AFTER HER FATHER WAS KNOCKING
ON THE DOOR.

25:00.299 --> 25:01.634
AND I'M SAYING IT WASN'T ME.

25:01.668 --> 25:03.803
A'IGHT, MY EMAIL'S
DIZZERDAWGDJ.

25:03.836 --> 25:06.138
Y'ALL WANNA CHECK IT?
YEAH, WE DO.

25:06.172 --> 25:07.640
WAS I LYING?

25:07.674 --> 25:08.708
BESIDES,

25:08.741 --> 25:10.242
LAST NIGHT AFTER I WENT

25:10.276 --> 25:12.779
AND I GAVE MY DNA
TO THAT FINE NUBIAN PRINCESS,

25:12.812 --> 25:14.280
HOPPED ON THE R TRAIN
OVER TO BROOKLYN

25:14.313 --> 25:15.815
TO DO A GIG.

25:15.848 --> 25:17.149
THEN DID SOME MORE ROCKIN'

25:17.183 --> 25:18.585
WITH A COUPLE TWINS
AFTERWARD.

25:18.618 --> 25:20.720
YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING?
DID I MENTION?

25:20.753 --> 25:21.854
(Fin)
YEAH, YEAH, WE KNOW.

25:21.888 --> 25:23.990
DECKS AND SEX.
THAT'S RIGHT.

25:24.023 --> 25:25.191
I'M TELLING YOU
WHOEVER DISSED THAT BITCH

25:25.224 --> 25:27.894
INTO KILLING HERSELF
IS SETTING ME UP.

25:27.927 --> 25:29.696
WELL, DON'T GET TOO TORN UP
ABOUT THAT BITCH.

25:29.729 --> 25:31.831
SHE WAS ONLY GONNA BE
THE MOTHER OF YOUR CHILD.

25:31.864 --> 25:34.233
[scoffs]

25:34.266 --> 25:36.703
I'M GONNA NEED THAT PHONE BACK,
FIVE-OH.

25:36.736 --> 25:37.937
YEAH, THEM TWINS ARE GONNA
BE WANTING ME

25:37.970 --> 25:40.873
TO DROP THAT ROPE ON 'EM
AGAIN, HA.

25:43.743 --> 25:45.778
DIZZER DIDN'T SEND
ANY EMAILS LAST NIGHT.

25:45.812 --> 25:48.014
DAMN, I WOULDA LIKED BUSTING
HIS DUMB ASS.

25:48.047 --> 25:49.315
ALL RIGHT, WELL,
WHOEVER DID THIS

25:49.348 --> 25:51.951
HAD TO KNOW ABOUT
FIDELIA'S ONE-NIGHT STAND.

25:51.984 --> 25:53.820
MAYBE ONE OF HER FRIENDS
IS DIZZER4EVER.

25:53.853 --> 25:56.055
(Fin)
NOTHING CRUELER
THAN HIGH SCHOOL GIRLS.

25:56.088 --> 25:57.624
(Munch)
WHY NOT ASK SOMEBODY
WHO KNOWS?

25:57.657 --> 25:58.925
WHILE YOU WERE OUT,

25:58.958 --> 26:00.292
I DID SOME DIGGING
ON THOSE EMAILS.

26:00.326 --> 26:02.228
I GOT THE IP ADDRESS.

26:02.261 --> 26:03.963
TRACKED DOWN WHERE
THEY WERE SENT FROM.

26:03.996 --> 26:05.798
A DELIGHTFULLY SKEEZY
LITTLE INTERNET CAFE

26:05.832 --> 26:07.133
ON GRAND STREET.

26:07.166 --> 26:08.701
THERE'S NO SIGN-IN SHEET.

26:08.735 --> 26:10.169
AND WHOEVER PAID
FOR THE COMPUTER TIME

26:10.202 --> 26:11.638
DID SO IN CASH.

26:11.671 --> 26:12.905
SO WHAT ARE YOU
SO COCKY ABOUT?

26:12.939 --> 26:14.040
TWO DOORS DOWN
IS A NAIL SALON.

26:14.073 --> 26:17.644
AND IN BETWEEN IS AN ATM MACHINE
WITH A SECURITY CAMERA.

26:17.677 --> 26:18.811
SO GUESS WHO GOT
A PEDICURE,

26:18.845 --> 26:20.980
TOOK 20 BUCKS OUT
OF THE ATM MACHINE,

26:21.013 --> 26:22.682
AND THEN BOPPED
INTO THE NET NOOK

26:22.715 --> 26:25.051
THREE MINUTES BEFORE
THE EMAILS STARTED?

26:28.655 --> 26:31.057
PEGGY BERNARDI.

26:33.926 --> 26:35.394
(Peggy)
YEAH, GOOD TIMING.

26:35.427 --> 26:37.129
WE'VE BEEN OUT ALL DAY.

26:37.163 --> 26:38.731
GUESS YOU GOT OVER
BEING MAD

26:38.765 --> 26:40.132
THAT TINA HAD
A BUN IN THE OVEN.

26:40.166 --> 26:41.901
HEY, WHAT AM I GONNA SAY?

26:41.934 --> 26:44.036
I HAD HER BROTHER
WHEN I WAS 16 YEARS OLD.

26:44.070 --> 26:45.337
ALEC, YOU HERE?

26:45.371 --> 26:47.239
AH, YOU BAILED YOUR SON OUT,
HUH?

26:47.273 --> 26:49.075
YEAH, I HAD TO PUT THE DEED UP
TO THIS PLACE.

26:49.108 --> 26:50.910
YOU STILL FOUND TIME
TO GO ON A SHOPPING SPREE.

26:50.943 --> 26:52.244
YOU'RE MOTHER OF THE YEAR.

26:52.278 --> 26:54.080
HEY, I TAKE CARE
OF MY KIDS

26:54.113 --> 26:55.815
JUST LIKE I'M GONNA DO
WITH MY GRANDBABY.

26:55.848 --> 26:57.817
AND WON'T HE LOOK CUTE
IN THIS?

26:57.850 --> 27:00.252
"MY GRANDMA IS A GILF."

27:00.286 --> 27:02.154
TOO BAD FIDELIA'S MOTHER
WON'T HAVE A CHANCE

27:02.188 --> 27:04.090
TO HOLD HER GRANDCHILD.

27:04.123 --> 27:04.891
OH, GOD, ISN'T THAT HORRIBLE?

27:04.924 --> 27:06.058
TINA LOVED FIDELIA
LIKE A SISTER.

27:06.092 --> 27:07.059
WE ALL DID.

27:07.093 --> 27:08.060
THEN WHY DID YOU TAUNT HER

27:08.094 --> 27:09.962
INTO KILLING HERSELF?

27:09.996 --> 27:10.997
DIZZER4EVER.

27:12.699 --> 27:13.833
WHAT IS THAT?

27:13.866 --> 27:15.001
(Stabler)
TINA, YOU BETTER GO
TO YOUR ROOM.

27:15.034 --> 27:16.302
(Peggy)
NO, YOU STAY HERE.

27:16.335 --> 27:17.970
THEY'RE LEAVING.
HEY, WHAT'S GOING ON?

27:18.004 --> 27:19.005
PULL UP A CHAIR.

27:19.038 --> 27:20.006
READ HOW YOUR MOTHER
DROVE FIDELIA TO SUICIDE.

27:20.039 --> 27:21.040
MOM, IS THAT TRUE?

27:21.073 --> 27:22.441
GET THE HELL OUT OF MY HOUSE!

27:22.474 --> 27:23.876
FIRST JUST TELL US WHY.

27:23.910 --> 27:25.044
YOU WANT ME TO ADMIT
THAT I WROTE IT?

27:25.077 --> 27:26.946
OKAY, FINE.

27:26.979 --> 27:27.947
I WROTE IT, OKAY?

27:27.980 --> 27:29.248
BUT THAT LITTLE SLUT
RUINED THIS FAMILY.

27:29.281 --> 27:30.416
IF IT WASN'T FOR HER,

27:30.449 --> 27:31.984
MY DAUGHTER WOULDN'T HAVE
GOTTEN PREGNANT

27:32.018 --> 27:33.986
AND MY SON WOULDN'T HAVE MADE
THE MISTAKE THAT HE DID.

27:34.020 --> 27:35.054
A TEENAGE GIRL HAS
MORE INFLUENCE

27:35.087 --> 27:36.055
OVER YOUR KIDS THAN YOU DO?

27:36.088 --> 27:37.156
BOO-HOO.
HER DEATH IS ON YOU.

27:37.189 --> 27:38.157
LEAVE HER ALONE!

27:38.190 --> 27:39.325
STEP BACK, TOUGH GUY.

27:39.358 --> 27:40.793
ALEC, STOP IT.

27:40.827 --> 27:41.961
TAKE YOUR SISTER AND GO
IN THE OTHER ROOM.

27:41.994 --> 27:43.362
NOW!
BOTH OF YOU!

27:48.334 --> 27:50.402
I DIDN'T TIE A ROPE
AROUND THE BITCH'S NECK.

27:50.436 --> 27:52.038
I ONLY TYPED WORDS
IN A COMPUTER.

27:52.071 --> 27:53.472
IF YOU HAD ANYTHING MORE
THAN THREATS

27:53.505 --> 27:55.007
AGAINST ME AND MY KIDS,

27:55.041 --> 27:56.075
YOU WOULD'VE ARRESTED ME
ALREADY.

27:56.108 --> 27:57.276
SO GET OUT.

27:59.946 --> 28:01.881
OUT!

28:06.185 --> 28:08.220
[scoffs]

28:08.254 --> 28:09.989
(Benson)
WE CAN'T CHARGE HER.

28:10.022 --> 28:11.958
THAT WOMAN MURDERED
FIDELIA VIDAL.

28:11.991 --> 28:13.092
NEW YORK HAS NOTHING
ON THE BOOKS YET

28:13.125 --> 28:13.893
AGAINST CYBER-BULLYING.

28:13.926 --> 28:15.828
TECHNOLOGY ALWAYS
OUTPACES THE LAW.

28:15.862 --> 28:16.996
WHATEVER.

28:17.029 --> 28:18.064
SO JUST GIVE US
ANOTHER STRATEGY THEN.

28:18.097 --> 28:19.766
I ONLY SAID MURDER IS OUT.

28:19.799 --> 28:21.100
WE CAN TRY FOR PROMOTING
A SUICIDE ATTEMPT.

28:21.133 --> 28:21.968
TRY.

28:22.001 --> 28:25.137
IT WAS WRITTEN
AS AN ANTI-KEVORKIAN LAW

28:25.171 --> 28:27.439
TO STOP DOCTOR-ASSISTED
SUICIDE.

28:27.473 --> 28:29.976
BUT MAYBE I CAN GET IT PAST
JUDGE MOREDOCK.

28:30.009 --> 28:31.143
AND IF YOU CAN'T?

28:31.177 --> 28:32.244
THEN WE GO FOR CRIMINAL
IMPERSONATION,

28:32.278 --> 28:34.380
AGGRAVATED HARASSMENT,

28:34.413 --> 28:35.848
AND ENDANGERING THE WELFARE
OF A CHILD.

28:35.882 --> 28:37.449
ALL MISDEMEANORS.
[phone rings]

28:37.483 --> 28:38.785
(Greylek)
SO WE THROW IN RECKLESS
ENDANGERMENT

28:38.818 --> 28:39.886
TO GET ANOTHER FELONY.

28:39.919 --> 28:40.920
(Munch)
FOLKS, WHAT'S IMMORAL

28:40.953 --> 28:42.021
IS NOT ALWAYS WHAT'S ILLEGAL.

28:42.054 --> 28:43.756
PEGGY BERNARDI MAY BE
A PSYCHO,

28:43.790 --> 28:45.157
BUT SHE ONLY USED WORDS.

28:45.191 --> 28:46.392
RIGHT, AGAINST
AN IMPRESSIONABLE,

28:46.425 --> 28:48.294
HORMONALLY-VOLATILE
TEENAGE GIRL.

28:48.327 --> 28:49.461
SO WRITE A NEW LAW,

28:49.495 --> 28:52.198
BUT DON'T TRAMPLE
ON THE FIRST AMENDMENT.

28:52.231 --> 28:54.100
(Cragen)
THAT WAS DOWNTOWN
WITH A HEADS-UP.

28:54.133 --> 28:57.003
SOMEBODY PUT THE BERNARDIS'
ADDRESS ON GOOGLE EARTH.

28:57.036 --> 28:59.471
THERE'S A CROWD CHASING HER
AROUND LITTLE ITALY,

28:59.505 --> 29:00.973
CALLING HER MONSTER MOM.

29:01.007 --> 29:02.274
YOU DON'T LIKE MY APPROACH,
MUNCH?

29:02.308 --> 29:04.877
IS MOB RULE ANY BETTER?

29:04.911 --> 29:07.179
[angry shouting]

29:07.213 --> 29:09.015
MY DAUGHTER IS DEAD
BECAUSE OF HER!

29:09.048 --> 29:10.149
PLEASE, EVERYONE,
CALM DOWN!

29:10.182 --> 29:11.383
THIS IS CRAZY!

29:11.417 --> 29:12.484
MY BOY'S DEAD.

29:12.518 --> 29:14.120
THE VIDAL GIRL IS DEAD.

29:14.153 --> 29:15.421
DO WE REALLY WANT MORE DEATH?

29:15.454 --> 29:17.023
WE'RE NEIGHBORS!

29:17.056 --> 29:18.858
SHE KILLED MY BABY!
NYPD! CLEAR THE HALL!

29:18.891 --> 29:20.459
CLEAR THE HALL NOW.

29:20.492 --> 29:24.130
EVERYBODY GET BACK!
GET AWAY FROM THE DOOR.

29:24.163 --> 29:25.364
MRS. BERNARDI,
THIS IS DETECTIVE STABLER.

29:25.397 --> 29:28.567
OPEN UP.

29:28.600 --> 29:30.102
THANK GOD.
YOU GOTTA SAVE US.

29:30.136 --> 29:31.103
YEAH, WE'LL SAVE YOU
RIGHT INTO JAIL.

29:31.137 --> 29:32.338
COME ON, LET'S GO!

29:32.371 --> 29:33.840
THEY'RE TRYING TO KILL ME
AND MY FAMILY.

29:33.873 --> 29:35.007
YOU KILLED FIDELIA!

29:35.041 --> 29:36.508
YOU KILLED HER!

29:36.542 --> 29:39.445
[shouting]

29:39.478 --> 29:41.480
YOU'RE DEAD IF I EVER
SEE YOU AGAIN!

29:45.584 --> 29:47.153
DOCKET ENDING 1488,

29:47.186 --> 29:49.188
PEOPLE VERSUS PEGGY BERNARDI.

29:49.221 --> 29:51.390
ONE COUNT PROMOTING
A SUICIDE ATTEMPT.

29:51.423 --> 29:53.559
ONE COUNT RECKLESS ENDANGERMENT.

29:53.592 --> 29:55.862
ONE COUNT CRIMINAL
IMPERSONATION.

29:55.895 --> 29:57.830
ONE COUNT AGGRAVATED
HARASSMENT.

29:57.864 --> 30:00.399
ONE COUNT ENDANGERING
THE WELFARE OF A CHILD.

30:00.432 --> 30:01.600
MR. GRANGER, HOW DOES
YOUR CLIENT PLEAD?

30:01.633 --> 30:03.469
I DIDN'T PROMOTE ANYTHING

30:03.502 --> 30:05.872
OR HARASS ANYONE RECKLESSLY
OR ANY OTHER WAY.

30:05.905 --> 30:06.873
THIS IS A BUNCH OF CRAP.

30:06.906 --> 30:07.940
GUILTY OR NOT?

30:07.974 --> 30:09.608
SHE PLEADS NOT GUILTY,
YOUR HONOR.

30:09.641 --> 30:10.609
BAIL, MS. GREYLEK?

30:10.642 --> 30:11.878
$500,000.

30:11.911 --> 30:12.979
ARE YOU OFF YOUR NUT?

30:13.012 --> 30:14.847
COUNSELOR, CONTROL
YOUR CLIENT.

30:14.881 --> 30:15.848
MIGHT NEED A STUN GUN.

30:15.882 --> 30:17.616
PEGGY, BE QUIET.

30:17.649 --> 30:18.550
I'M SORRY, YOUR HONOR,

30:18.584 --> 30:20.552
BUT MS. BERNARDI NEEDS
TO BE AT HOME

30:20.586 --> 30:24.556
TO MAKE SURE HER DAUGHTER
RECEIVES PROPER PRENATAL CARE.

30:24.590 --> 30:26.392
HER OTHER CHILD
IS ON HOME CONFINEMENT

30:26.425 --> 30:27.459
ON AN UNRELATED CHARGE

30:27.493 --> 30:29.929
AND NEEDS HIS MOTHER'S AID
IN PREPARING A DEFENSE.

30:29.962 --> 30:31.931
DO 'EM BOTH A FAVOR.
KEEP HER CAGED.

30:31.964 --> 30:33.866
WHAT IS YOUR PROBLEM?

30:33.900 --> 30:36.102
MY CLIENT HAS LIVED
IN THE SAME COMMUNITY

30:36.135 --> 30:38.270
FOR HER ENTIRE LIFE
AND IS HARDLY A FLIGHT RISK.

30:38.304 --> 30:40.539
AND THESE CHARGES
ARE AS TENUOUS

30:40.572 --> 30:42.508
AS THEY ARE NUMEROUS.

30:42.541 --> 30:43.910
I'LL AGREE THERE,
MS. GREYLEK.

30:43.943 --> 30:44.643
BAIL IS SET AT $50,000.

30:44.676 --> 30:45.878
YOUR HONOR,

30:45.912 --> 30:47.113
AS A CONDITION OF BAIL,

30:47.146 --> 30:48.580
THE PEOPLE ASK
THAT THE DEFENDANT

30:48.614 --> 30:50.649
BE PROHIBITED FROM USING
A COMPUTER

30:50.682 --> 30:52.551
OR ANY FORM OF ELECTRONIC
COMMUNICATION

30:52.584 --> 30:55.287
LEST ANY OTHER YOUNG PERSON'S
LIFE BE THREATENED.

30:55.321 --> 30:57.023
HEY, I GOT AUCTIONS
ON EBAY.

30:57.056 --> 30:59.458
MS. BERNARDI,
UNPLUG THE COMPUTER.

30:59.491 --> 31:00.459
ADJOURNED.

31:00.492 --> 31:01.460
[bangs gavel]

31:01.493 --> 31:03.095
NEXT CASE.

31:03.129 --> 31:04.630
(Granger)
TRY TO RELAX.

31:06.632 --> 31:08.667
YOUR ANIMOSITY IS SHOWING,
COUNSELOR.

31:08.700 --> 31:10.136
SO IS YOUR LACK
OF JUDGMENT.

31:10.169 --> 31:11.203
YOUR CLIENT'S A MURDERER.

31:11.237 --> 31:12.671
FUNNY, OF ALL THE CHARGES
YOU FILED,

31:12.704 --> 31:14.373
YOU FORGOT TO FILE
THAT ONE.

31:14.406 --> 31:17.009
THE LAW HASN'T QUITE CAUGHT UP
TO WHAT MONSTER MOM DID,

31:17.043 --> 31:17.876
BUT I'LL GET IT THERE.

31:17.910 --> 31:19.912
YOU REALLY THINK
YOU CAN CONVINCE A JURY

31:19.946 --> 31:21.213
THAT A SINGLE MOTHER
OF TWO KIDS

31:21.247 --> 31:22.681
TOOK TIME OFF FROM
HER BUSY DAY

31:22.714 --> 31:25.617
TO TAUNT A NEIGHBOR GIRL
INTO COMMITTING SUICIDE?

31:25.651 --> 31:26.652
YOU KIDDING?

31:26.685 --> 31:28.420
FIVE MINUTES OF HER
ON THE STAND

31:28.454 --> 31:31.357
AND THEY'LL SEE
SHE'S THE DEVIL.

31:34.326 --> 31:37.596
I'M A LOVING MOTHER.
A GOOD PERSON.

31:37.629 --> 31:40.933
SO A GOOD PERSON GOES ONLINE,
ATTACKS AN UNDERAGE KID

31:40.967 --> 31:42.334
WHILE PRETENDING TO BE
SOMEONE ELSE?

31:42.368 --> 31:44.236
IT WA--WAS JUST IN FUN.

31:44.270 --> 31:45.371
THEN WHY DID YOU
SEND HER EMAILS

31:45.404 --> 31:46.472
FROM AN INTERNET CAFE?

31:46.505 --> 31:47.673
WAS THERE SOMETHING WRONG

31:47.706 --> 31:49.208
WITH YOUR COMPUTER AT HOME?

31:49.241 --> 31:51.243
(Peggy)
IT WAS CONVENIENT.

31:51.277 --> 31:53.279
MS. BERNARDI,
WOULD YOU PLEASE READ

31:53.312 --> 31:55.314
TO THE JURY WHAT YOU WROTE,
IMPERSONATING SOMEONE ELSE,

31:55.347 --> 31:57.716
TO MS. VIDAL.

31:57.749 --> 32:01.387
"OMFG.

32:01.420 --> 32:04.256
"YOU'RE A DUMB WHORE.

32:04.290 --> 32:06.692
HOW DUMB TO YOU THINK
THAT BABY WILL BE?"

32:06.725 --> 32:09.061
AND OMFG MEANS?

32:09.095 --> 32:10.529
OH, MY BLANKIN' GOD.

32:10.562 --> 32:11.530
SO THAT'S WHAT A GOOD PERSON

32:11.563 --> 32:13.565
WRITES TO A PREGNANT
TEENAGE GIRL.

32:13.599 --> 32:15.067
I WAS MAD ABOUT WHAT
SHE DID TO THIS FAMILY.

32:15.101 --> 32:16.735
SHE TOLD MY GIRL
TO GET PREGNANT--

32:16.768 --> 32:20.039
NEXT LINE, PLEASE.

32:23.509 --> 32:24.543
"EVERYONE HATES YOU.

32:24.576 --> 32:27.713
SO STFU, LOL."

32:27.746 --> 32:29.181
(Greylek)
AND STFU MEANS?

32:29.215 --> 32:30.482
SHUT THE BLANK UP.

32:30.516 --> 32:32.018
AND LOL?

32:32.051 --> 32:33.452
LAUGHING OUT LOUD.

32:33.485 --> 32:37.256
SO A GOOD PERSON LAUGHS
OUT LOUD

32:37.289 --> 32:38.757
AFTER TELLING A PREGNANT
TEENAGE GIRL

32:38.790 --> 32:40.026
TO SHUT THE BLANK UP.

32:40.059 --> 32:41.660
SHE DID A LOT WORSE
TO MY FAMILY.

32:41.693 --> 32:43.229
NEXT LINE PLEASE.

32:49.601 --> 32:51.737
I'M SORRY, DID YOU SUDDENLY
FORGET HOW TO READ?

32:56.642 --> 32:59.011
"THE WORLD DOESN'T NEED YOU,
SLUT.

32:59.045 --> 33:02.048
END IT.
END IT NOW."

33:02.081 --> 33:07.019
AND A GOOD PERSON WRITES,
"END IT, END IT NOW,"

33:07.053 --> 33:09.021
TO A PREGNANT TEENAGE GIRL

33:09.055 --> 33:10.689
AND NEVER THINKS
FOR A SECOND

33:10.722 --> 33:11.523
THAT SHE MIGHT
ACTUALLY DO IT?

33:11.557 --> 33:12.758
IT--IT WAS JUST A GOOF.
I NEVER--

33:12.791 --> 33:14.493
ONE LAST THING,
MS. BERNARDI.

33:14.526 --> 33:16.028
PLEASE READ TO THE JURY
WHAT MS. VIDAL WROTE

33:16.062 --> 33:17.529
TO YOU IN HER FINAL EMAIL.

33:25.471 --> 33:26.772
"WHY ARE YOU SO MEAN?

33:26.805 --> 33:29.708
FORGET IT.
FATH IS KNOCKING.

33:29.741 --> 33:31.043
GOTTA GO."

33:31.077 --> 33:32.144
THAT'S RIGHT.

33:32.178 --> 33:34.180
HER FATHER WAS KNOCKING.

33:34.213 --> 33:35.714
COMING TO CHECK ON FIDELIA

33:35.747 --> 33:37.749
AFTER SHE HAD BEEN CRYING
FOR HOURS.

33:37.783 --> 33:40.452
THAT'S WHAT A GOOD PERSON DOES.

33:40.486 --> 33:41.820
A GOOD PARENT.

33:41.853 --> 33:44.656
THEY DON'T PERSECUTE
OTHER PEOPLE'S KIDS.

33:44.690 --> 33:47.426
THEY DON'T LET THEIR DAUGHTERS
BECOME TEENAGE MOMS

33:47.459 --> 33:49.061
OR THEIR SONS BECOME
REVENGE KILLERS.

33:49.095 --> 33:50.762
NO!
YOU'RE WRONG.

33:50.796 --> 33:52.798
MS. BERNARDI,
YOU NEED TO SIT DOWN.

33:52.831 --> 33:54.466
BUT SHE'S WRONG.
MY MOM'S WRONG TOO.

33:54.500 --> 33:55.767
FATH ISN'T SHORT FOR FATHER.

33:55.801 --> 33:57.369
(Moredock)
BAILIFF,
REMOVE THAT YOUNG LADY.

33:57.403 --> 33:58.404
FATH MEANS F-A-T-H.

33:58.437 --> 33:59.771
"FIRST AND TRUE HUSBAND."

33:59.805 --> 34:01.740
THEY SAY IT IN A CLUB
AT SCHOOL.

34:01.773 --> 34:02.808
THE CHASTITY CIRCLE.

34:02.841 --> 34:06.712
FIDELIA'S FIRST AND TRUE
HUSBAND WAS MAX MATARAZZO.

34:06.745 --> 34:08.114
THE VIDALS WERE HOME.

34:08.147 --> 34:10.082
WHEN FIDELIA ANSWERED
THE FRONT DOOR,

34:10.116 --> 34:12.251
THEY WOULD'VE SEEN MAX
COME IN.

34:15.721 --> 34:18.824
FIDELIA'S DAD
IS KIND OF A JERK.

34:18.857 --> 34:20.459
I CAME UP THE FIRE ESCAPE

34:20.492 --> 34:22.461
TO VISIT HER
SO HE WOULDN'T KNOW.

34:22.494 --> 34:25.464
BUT WE DIDN'T KNOW
BECAUSE YOU DIDN'T TELL US.

34:25.497 --> 34:28.134
EVEN WHEN WE ASKED YOU QUESTIONS
ABOUT FIDELIA.

34:28.167 --> 34:30.536
AND I SHOULD HAVE.

34:30.569 --> 34:32.471
LOOK, IT WAS JUST
ALL TOO CRAZY,

34:32.504 --> 34:33.472
OKAY?

34:33.505 --> 34:35.274
MAYBE YOU WERE FEELING GUILTY.

34:35.307 --> 34:36.275
GUILTY?

34:36.308 --> 34:37.276
ABOUT WHAT YOU DID
TO HIM.

34:37.309 --> 34:38.877
SOMETHING BAD.

34:38.910 --> 34:41.580
NO--NO,
I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING BAD.

34:41.613 --> 34:44.783
MURDER IS A SIN, MAX.
YOU KNOW THAT.

34:44.816 --> 34:47.853
WHAT?
NO--LISTEN.

34:47.886 --> 34:50.889
I LOVED FIDELIA, OKAY?

34:50.922 --> 34:53.359
AND--
AND SHE COMMITTED SUICIDE.

34:53.392 --> 34:54.360
DID SHE?

34:54.393 --> 34:56.728
WHY WOULD I KILL HER?

34:56.762 --> 34:59.298
WE HAVE BEEN TOGETHER
FOREVER.

34:59.331 --> 35:02.801
LOOK, IT'S NOT LIKE
WE DIDN'T WANT TO DO IT, OKAY?

35:02.834 --> 35:04.870
OF COURSE WE DID.
EVERYONE'S DOING IT.

35:04.903 --> 35:06.205
BUT WE MADE A COMMITMENT
TO EACH OTHER.

35:06.238 --> 35:07.573
WE MADE A COMMITMENT TO GOD.

35:07.606 --> 35:08.840
THAT YOU WERE HER FIRST
AND TRUE HUSBAND.

35:08.874 --> 35:11.443
AND SHE WAS MY FIRST
AND TRUE WIFE.

35:11.477 --> 35:13.479
SHE WASN'T EXACTLY
SO TRUE.

35:13.512 --> 35:14.680
I FORGAVE HER FOR THAT.

35:14.713 --> 35:15.747
REALLY?

35:15.781 --> 35:18.750
YOU FORGAVE HER, HUH?

35:21.753 --> 35:26.425
THAT SHE GAVE IT UP
TO DIZZER?

35:26.458 --> 35:29.695
SHE TOOK HER CLOTHES OFF
FOR DIZZER.

35:31.963 --> 35:36.902
SHE LET DIZZER TOUCH
HER BODY ALL OVER.

35:36.935 --> 35:38.337
SHE MADE LOVE

35:38.370 --> 35:41.840
TO DIZZER,
A COMPLETE STRANGER.

35:41.873 --> 35:44.243
AND ALL YOU GOT
WAS A BROKEN PROMISE?

35:45.911 --> 35:47.579
NO.

35:47.613 --> 35:48.380
THAT'S WHY YOU WENT BACK
TO HER HOUSE THAT NIGHT.

35:48.414 --> 35:50.682
MAYBE YOU FORGAVE HER
TOO FAST.

35:59.325 --> 36:01.227
I KEPT EMAILING HER.

36:01.260 --> 36:03.495
I KEPT TEXTING HER.

36:03.529 --> 36:06.798
AND SHE KEPT BLOWING ME OFF.

36:06.832 --> 36:08.934
SAYING THAT SHE WAS
IN THE MIDDLE OF SOMETHING.

36:08.967 --> 36:10.236
RIGHT, AND WHEN YOU CRAWLED
IN THROUGH HER WINDOW,

36:10.269 --> 36:11.703
THERE SHE WAS AGAIN
WITH DIZZER,

36:11.737 --> 36:12.971
THIS TIME ONLINE.

36:13.004 --> 36:14.873
HE WAS CALLING HER A SLUT
AND A WHORE.

36:14.906 --> 36:16.475
SHE WAS CRYING.

36:16.508 --> 36:18.244
I'LL BET SHE NEVER CRIED
LIKE THAT FOR YOU.

36:18.277 --> 36:19.778
NONE OF THIS WOULD'VE EVER
HAPPENED

36:19.811 --> 36:20.979
IF SHE'D KEPT HER PROMISE
TO ME.

36:21.012 --> 36:22.548
THE ONLY THING
SHE CARED ABOUT

36:22.581 --> 36:24.750
WAS WHETHER DIZZER
OR OTHER PEOPLE HATED HER.

36:24.783 --> 36:28.454
THE ONLY PERSON SHE DIDN'T CARE
ABOUT WAS YOU, MAX.

36:34.960 --> 36:40.399
I TRIED TO HUG HER
TO GET HER TO STOP CRYING.

36:40.432 --> 36:44.903
AND SHE SLAPPED ME.

36:44.936 --> 36:47.005
SAID THAT SHE NEVER LOVED ME.

36:47.038 --> 36:50.008
THAT SHE NEVER
WOULD'VE MARRIED ME.

36:50.041 --> 36:51.977
SAID THAT THE ONLY REASON
I WAS STAYING A VIRGIN

36:52.010 --> 36:55.514
WAS BECAUSE I WAS SCARED
TO HAVE SEX.

36:55.547 --> 36:57.249
SCARED THAT I COULDN'T DO IT!

36:57.283 --> 36:59.918
THAT'S WHEN YOU PUT
YOUR HANDS AROUND HER NECK.

37:02.053 --> 37:04.490
I JUST WANTED HER
TO STOP YELLING.

37:04.523 --> 37:05.691
SO YOU KEPT SQUEEZING
AND SQUEEZING

37:05.724 --> 37:07.326
UNTIL SHE FINALLY DID.

37:12.030 --> 37:13.299
THEN YOU WRAPPED THE BELT
AROUND HER NECK

37:13.332 --> 37:15.601
AND MADE IT LOOK
LIKE A SUICIDE.

37:28.347 --> 37:31.983
I'VE ASKED FOR FORGIVENESS...

37:32.017 --> 37:34.986
EVERY NIGHT SINCE.

37:40.091 --> 37:41.960
BUT GOD DOESN'T ANSWER ME.

37:45.864 --> 37:48.300
HE SAYS NOTHING.

37:51.603 --> 37:55.941
I'M THE ONE WHO KEPT
MY PROMISE.

37:55.974 --> 37:58.810
I'M NOT THE BAD ONE.

38:00.912 --> 38:03.014
WHY?

38:03.048 --> 38:07.419
WHY WON'T HE ANSWER ME?

38:14.960 --> 38:16.094

38:41.620 --> 38:43.689
OF THE CONVICTION
OF MAX MATARAZZO,

38:43.722 --> 38:46.124
THIS COURT DISMISSES
ALL CHARGES AGAINST YOU.

38:46.157 --> 38:47.926
YOU ARE FREE TO GO.

38:47.959 --> 38:49.828
[bangs gavel]

38:53.499 --> 38:54.533
I'M SO HAPPY.

38:54.566 --> 38:56.468
I TOLD YOU I WAS INNOCENT.

38:56.502 --> 38:57.335
THERE'S A BIG DIFFERENCE

38:57.369 --> 38:59.371
BETWEEN CHARGES DROPPED
AND INNOCENT.

38:59.405 --> 39:00.406
I'M SURE YOUR NEIGHBORS
WILL EXPLAIN IT TO YOU

39:00.439 --> 39:01.072
WHEN YOU GET HOME.

39:01.106 --> 39:03.041
THEY CAN GO TO HELL.
YOU TOO.

39:03.074 --> 39:04.776
JUST TRY AND WASH THE BLOOD
OFF YOUR HANDS

39:04.810 --> 39:06.645
BEFORE YOU HOLD TINA'S BABY
FOR THE FIRST TIME, OKAY?

39:06.678 --> 39:07.846
YOU SHUT YOUR FREAKIN' MOUTH!

39:07.879 --> 39:08.980
I'LL FREAKIN' KILL YOU!

39:09.014 --> 39:09.981
BAILIFF!

39:10.015 --> 39:11.650
UGH!
YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW ME!

39:11.683 --> 39:13.785
I'M A GOOD MOTHER!

39:13.819 --> 39:15.086
I'M A GOOD MOTHER!
WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS TO ME!

39:15.120 --> 39:17.022
GET OFF OF ME!
TINA!

39:17.055 --> 39:18.957
COME ON, LET'S GO.

39:18.990 --> 39:20.392
I'M A GOOD MOTHER!

39:20.426 --> 39:21.827
YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW ME!

39:21.860 --> 39:22.994
WHAT DO YOU HAVE AGAINST ME?
YOU OKAY?

39:23.028 --> 39:25.063
STOP IT!
GET OFF OF ME!

39:25.096 --> 39:26.131
FINE.

39:57.963 --> 40:01.667
IT'S GONNA BE BAD,
ISN'T IT?

40:01.700 --> 40:03.702
UH...

40:03.735 --> 40:05.136
IF I HADN'T BEEN SO STUPID,

40:05.170 --> 40:07.539
NONE OF THIS
WOULD'VE HAPPENED.

40:07.573 --> 40:09.708
TINA, RIGHT NOW,
WHAT YOU'VE GOT TO DO

40:09.741 --> 40:11.743
IS TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF
AND TAKE CARE OF THAT BABY.

40:11.777 --> 40:12.844
HOW?

40:12.878 --> 40:15.547
MY WHOLE FAMILY'S IN JAIL.

40:15.581 --> 40:20.952
AND NOW THEY'RE GONNA SEND ME
TO A--A FOSTER HOME.

40:20.986 --> 40:23.489
I'M NOT SO SURE ABOUT THAT.

40:30.261 --> 40:33.499
HI, TINA.

40:33.532 --> 40:36.034
MR. GALLI,

40:36.067 --> 40:37.135
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

40:37.168 --> 40:40.906
I CAME TO...

40:40.939 --> 40:43.809
TALK TO THE JUDGE.

40:43.842 --> 40:46.512
TELL HIM...

40:46.545 --> 40:48.246
A BABY SHOULDN'T BE BORN

40:48.279 --> 40:50.516
SURROUNDED BY STRANGERS.

40:50.549 --> 40:53.151
A BABY NEEDS A HOME.

40:55.554 --> 40:58.990
ESPECIALLY MY GRANDCHILD.

41:02.260 --> 41:04.262
I'M SO SORRY

41:04.295 --> 41:06.464
ABOUT WHAT MY BROTHER DID.

41:11.069 --> 41:14.239
IT'S NOT ABOUT THE PAST,
