WEBVTT

00:22.746 --> 00:25.217
Do you like my toupee,
Barbarian?

00:25.283 --> 00:26.483
Demon dogs!

00:26.550 --> 00:28.519
He's taken a piece of
Ookla's mane

00:28.586 --> 00:30.588
and used it
to cover his bald spot.

00:30.654 --> 00:33.390
Why can't cat people
just grow old gracefully?

00:42.700 --> 00:45.036
<i>Ariel, Ookla! Ride!</i>

00:53.644 --> 00:55.613
Huh?

01:09.861 --> 01:13.631
There's a creature on the wing!
It's attacking the aluminum.

01:14.332 --> 01:16.234
Shaggy!

01:16.301 --> 01:18.203
I've got you, Scoob!

01:24.242 --> 01:28.179
Like, whatever you do,
don't look behind you.

01:28.246 --> 01:30.081
Behind me?

01:30.148 --> 01:31.917
No! Don't look behind you.

01:35.486 --> 01:37.488
Well, like,
don't look down either.

01:37.554 --> 01:39.723
That's cowardice 101, Scoob.

01:50.101 --> 01:52.003
Now, Scoob!

01:58.542 --> 01:59.710
It worked!

01:59.777 --> 02:01.980
Come on, Velma.
Let's reel him in.

02:06.617 --> 02:07.685
Yeah!

02:14.725 --> 02:18.762
Wow. A real-life monster
here in my hangar.

02:18.830 --> 02:20.564
I can't believe
you kids caught it.

02:20.631 --> 02:22.666
Not an "it," Mr. HB.

02:25.669 --> 02:27.604
Herman Ellinger.

02:27.671 --> 02:31.709
That's the rude passenger
from B17. But why?

02:31.775 --> 02:34.879
Why? Because airline tickets
cost an arm and a leg.

02:34.946 --> 02:37.349
I knew if I could scare
your passengers away

02:37.415 --> 02:38.984
you'd have to lower
your prices,

02:39.050 --> 02:41.585
and I could fly almost anywhere
for practically nothing.

02:41.652 --> 02:44.923
Yeah! Airline prices
are the real monster.

02:44.990 --> 02:46.790
I don't think
you get discounts for...

02:46.858 --> 02:48.625
And I would have
gotten away with it, too,

02:48.692 --> 02:51.396
if it wasn't for you meddling
kids and that mangy mutt of yours.

02:51.463 --> 02:52.696
Hey!

02:59.670 --> 03:01.973
I can't thank you kids enough.

03:02.040 --> 03:04.541
But I still don't know
how you figured it out.

03:04.608 --> 03:06.378
Easy. With science.

03:06.444 --> 03:09.314
After the first sighting
of the monster, I had an idea.

03:09.381 --> 03:12.150
I collected scraps from leftover
food served on the airplane

03:12.217 --> 03:14.152
and cross referenced
the DNA samples

03:14.219 --> 03:16.687
against the piece of hair
we found on the plane's wing.

03:16.754 --> 03:18.323
Incredible.

03:18.390 --> 03:21.993
DNA? Gee, that doesn't sound
like mystery-solving at all.

03:22.060 --> 03:24.829
The only mystery is why anyone
would try to solve anything

03:24.896 --> 03:26.865
without good old science
to back them up.

03:26.931 --> 03:29.600
Say, uh,
there's two other papers here.

03:29.666 --> 03:31.635
Oh, that's because
there were two extra people

03:31.702 --> 03:36.007
that ate the food on the plane,
despite us asking them not to.

03:40.644 --> 03:42.380
Uh-oh. What'd we do?

03:42.447 --> 03:45.783
It looks like the lab ran your
DNA test along with Ellinger's.

03:45.850 --> 03:48.453
Are you guys curious
where your ancestors came from?

03:48.520 --> 03:51.688
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Huh? Denmark?

03:51.755 --> 03:54.526
Well, you are a Great Dane
after all.

03:54.591 --> 03:58.229
Emphasis on the "great."

03:58.296 --> 03:59.630
What about you, Shaggy?

03:59.696 --> 04:01.900
It says my ancestors
come from a small village

04:01.966 --> 04:05.736
in the north of England called
Norville o'er Morgania.

04:05.803 --> 04:07.939
- Huh? What a weird name.
- Hmm.

04:08.006 --> 04:10.041
It says here
that Norville o'er Morgania

04:10.108 --> 04:14.345
is known to be one of the suspected
locations of the ancient city of Camelot.

04:14.412 --> 04:19.217
Also, it says that it has the best fish
and chips in all of the United Kingdom.

04:19.284 --> 04:21.119
- Fish?
- And chips?

04:24.755 --> 04:27.425
Those were fries,
but I'm still on board.

04:27.492 --> 04:29.060
I wish we could go, gang.

04:29.127 --> 04:31.728
But we didn't go into
mystery solving for the money.

04:31.795 --> 04:33.998
Well, Daphne was right
on one account.

04:34.065 --> 04:36.101
Airline prices
are the real monster.

04:36.167 --> 04:38.735
Well, it's lucky
I have an airline then.

04:38.802 --> 04:40.637
What do you mean, Mr. HB?

04:40.704 --> 04:42.140
What do I mean?

04:42.207 --> 04:44.843
You just saved my whole airline
from bankruptcy.

04:44.909 --> 04:49.147
I'll fly you and your friends
anywhere you wanna go, free of charge.

04:49.214 --> 04:51.182
It's the least I can do.

04:51.249 --> 04:54.785
Well, gang, I guess we're
headed to jolly old England.

06:02.987 --> 06:04.889
That sure
was nice of Mr. HB

06:04.956 --> 06:06.558
to ship over
the Mystery Machine.

06:06.624 --> 06:08.459
It sure was.

06:08.526 --> 06:10.929
Say, Fred, the map says you were
supposed to make a left back there.

06:10.995 --> 06:15.066
Map? Oh, Daphne,
Jones men don't need maps.

06:15.133 --> 06:17.635
We were born with
an innate sense of direction.

06:17.701 --> 06:19.938
We were made
for the open road.

06:20.004 --> 06:21.606
Fred!

06:26.844 --> 06:28.812
Fred, you do know
that they drive

06:28.880 --> 06:31.349
on the left side of the road
in England, right?

06:31.416 --> 06:33.284
Boy. They built
the roads wrong...

06:33.351 --> 06:36.120
Is this the one where the toilet
water goes the wrong way, too?

06:40.992 --> 06:42.961
Say, look at that.

06:45.396 --> 06:48.366
See? I told you
I knew where we were going.

06:51.536 --> 06:52.670
Fred!

06:52.736 --> 06:54.372
I got it.
Just testing you.

07:04.415 --> 07:06.884
Wow. It looks like
they're about to have a party.

07:06.951 --> 07:08.720
Good timing.

07:08.785 --> 07:09.820
Party?

07:09.887 --> 07:11.522
Oh, man. That means...

07:11.589 --> 07:14.225
Party food!

07:14.292 --> 07:17.729
"Fish and chips.
Bangers and mash. Toad in the hole."

07:19.264 --> 07:22.233
"Welsh rarebit. Spotted dick.
Jam roly-poly."

07:22.300 --> 07:23.935
Are these real?

07:24.002 --> 07:27.839
I guess. "Bubble and squeak.
Jellied eels. Angels on horseback."

07:29.340 --> 07:31.808
It's like
a whole new world of food.

07:35.913 --> 07:38.650
Like, Scoob and I
are gonna go grab a snack.

07:38.716 --> 07:40.351
We'll be right back.

07:40.418 --> 07:43.254
This place is kind of a dump, gang.
Like, run-down.

07:43.321 --> 07:45.990
Some of the architecture is
left over from medieval times.

07:46.057 --> 07:51.729
Dudes, the place we're staying is all that
remains standing of the Kingdom of Camelot.

07:51.795 --> 07:53.531
Camelot? Like King Arthur?

07:53.598 --> 07:57.068
Merlin? Knights of the Round Table?
We're standing on history.

07:57.135 --> 07:58.903
Weren't you just calling
this place a dump?

07:58.970 --> 08:01.639
Yeah, but now it's a dump
where knights lived.

08:01.706 --> 08:05.643
There's very little evidence that
Camelot or King Arthur even existed.

08:05.710 --> 08:07.211
Oh, but he did.

08:07.278 --> 08:09.647
That's what we're celebrating.

08:09.714 --> 08:14.018
Hi. I'm Mr. Saunders,
the mayor of this fine city,

08:14.085 --> 08:17.088
and this here is my assistant,
Sandi.

08:17.155 --> 08:19.123
- Hello.
- Nice to meet you.

08:19.190 --> 08:22.160
I'm Daphne, and these are my
friends, Velma and Fred.

08:22.226 --> 08:25.263
- Nice to meet you.
- Yeah, you, too.

08:25.330 --> 08:28.800
You seemed awfully sure that
King Arthur really existed.

08:28.866 --> 08:30.034
How can you be certain?

08:30.101 --> 08:32.570
Because of our name, of course.

08:32.637 --> 08:35.907
Norville o'er Morgania.

08:37.975 --> 08:41.212
You don't know the story?
Well, not many do.

08:41.279 --> 08:44.115
But never fear.
Soon, everyone will.

08:44.182 --> 08:49.320
It all began a long time ago,
right here, on the site of Camelot.

08:49.387 --> 08:51.122
That's right.
The good King Arthur

08:51.189 --> 08:53.858
came under attack by
the villainous Morgan Le Fey.

08:53.925 --> 08:58.763
Everything seemed bleak until a
brave knight appeared. Sir Norville.

08:58.831 --> 09:00.431
Known for his fearlessness,

09:00.498 --> 09:03.534
this knight fought the evil
witch and saved Camelot.

09:03.601 --> 09:06.170
Witches? Wizards? Come on.

09:06.237 --> 09:08.172
Those stories
came out of the Dark Ages,

09:08.239 --> 09:10.241
where nothing
could be accounted for.

09:10.308 --> 09:13.678
A disbeliever. That's okay.

09:13.745 --> 09:15.380
Stay in this town
a little while

09:15.446 --> 09:18.983
and you'll experience
the magic yourselves.

09:19.050 --> 09:20.985
The Mayor
has worked really hard

09:21.052 --> 09:23.054
to make this
the greatest celebration ever.

09:23.121 --> 09:25.590
We have horse races,
archery demonstrations,

09:25.656 --> 09:29.193
an unbelievable light show
and even a pie-eating contest.

09:29.260 --> 09:32.530
Did someone say pie eating?

09:33.097 --> 09:34.499
And who is this?

09:34.565 --> 09:38.002
My name's Shaggy,
and this is my pal, Scooby-Doo.

09:38.069 --> 09:40.104
- Hello.
- Nice to meet you.

09:40.171 --> 09:42.073
Shaggy's actually
the reason we're here.

09:42.140 --> 09:46.210
It turns out that Shaggy's ancestors
are from Norville o'er Morgania.

09:46.277 --> 09:48.079
Norville is a Shaggy name.

09:48.146 --> 09:51.349
Yeah. My name's Norville.
Surname Rogers.

09:51.416 --> 09:54.919
But, uh, nobody calls me "Sir."
That's my dad's name.

09:54.986 --> 09:57.121
Oh, really? You're sure?

09:57.188 --> 10:00.191
He's been a Norville his whole
life, and the DNA test proves it.

10:00.258 --> 10:02.026
Norville's a name
that's been handed down

10:02.093 --> 10:04.762
in our family, like...
Like, forever.

10:04.830 --> 10:07.866
Just like this medallion.

10:07.932 --> 10:09.700
My mom gave it to me for luck.

10:14.572 --> 10:15.973
Luck, indeed.

10:16.040 --> 10:17.642
We thought we'd look around.

10:17.708 --> 10:20.411
Who knows? Maybe Shaggy's
ancestors left him something.

10:20.478 --> 10:23.147
I'm hoping for some sort of
medieval pizza.

10:23.214 --> 10:25.416
Or jellied eels.

10:25.483 --> 10:28.386
Yes. Well, we have to be going.

10:30.455 --> 10:33.591
- It can't be.
- Sandi.

10:33.658 --> 10:36.160
You'll never guess
what just happened...

10:39.932 --> 10:41.566
Did you hear...

10:44.168 --> 10:46.671
- That was strange.
- Small towns are weird.

10:46.737 --> 10:48.773
Remember that time
you dyed your hair blond

10:48.841 --> 10:51.175
and everyone in that little
northeastern town was talking about it?

10:51.242 --> 10:55.012
Oh, yeah. Being blond was
definitely not more fun that day.

10:55.079 --> 10:57.582
And then they all turned into
fish people and tried to eat us.

10:57.648 --> 10:59.484
That's less of
a "small town thing"

10:59.550 --> 11:01.954
than it is
a "Scooby Gang thing."

11:02.019 --> 11:04.088
Come on.
The library is this way.

11:04.155 --> 11:05.790
How do you know?

11:05.858 --> 11:08.459
The same way Scooby and Shaggy
always know where the food is.

11:15.433 --> 11:16.902
I don't know, Scooby-Doo.

11:16.969 --> 11:20.839
Are you getting that same sort
of haunted vibe as I am?

11:20.906 --> 11:22.240
Uh-huh.

11:22.306 --> 11:23.976
Doesn't everything give you
the haunted vibe?

11:24.041 --> 11:26.143
It's called
managing expectations.

11:26.210 --> 11:28.246
Don't worry, guys.

11:28.312 --> 11:31.884
The only thing scary about this library
is it still uses the Dewey Decimal System.

11:31.950 --> 11:34.619
Yes, I understand. Goodbye.

11:34.685 --> 11:36.220
Unbelievable.

11:36.287 --> 11:37.956
Next thing
you're gonna tell me,

11:38.022 --> 11:40.424
they put the horror and
romance section side by side.

11:46.430 --> 11:47.933
Hi. I was wondering...

11:48.000 --> 11:50.034
Shh! This is a place of study.

11:50.101 --> 11:52.004
Use your library voice, please.

11:52.069 --> 11:54.071
Of course. I'm sorry.

11:58.276 --> 12:00.711
Is it just me
or is this place dead?

12:00.778 --> 12:01.847
Shh!

12:01.914 --> 12:03.648
We were visiting and wondered

12:03.714 --> 12:05.650
if you can point us to the books
on the history of your town.

12:05.716 --> 12:09.487
Near the back,
past the horror and romance section.

12:09.554 --> 12:11.556
Next to the horror
and romance section?

12:11.622 --> 12:15.326
Sure. Because those genres
are so similar.

12:15.393 --> 12:17.029
Exactly.

12:17.094 --> 12:19.965
But you'll need to hurry. We're closing
in 20 minutes for the big party.

12:20.032 --> 12:23.668
Why we should be celebrating such a
preposterous story, I'll never know,

12:23.734 --> 12:26.203
but one must do
what one must do.

12:26.270 --> 12:29.740
Okay. We'll be quick.
Thank you.

12:37.950 --> 12:42.753
Hand luggage... Hobnockers...
Hypermarkets... Ham hocks...

12:42.820 --> 12:47.391
Ooh. You can never know enough
about a subject you love.

12:52.563 --> 12:56.467
Here it is. History of Sir
Norville and Morgan Le Fey.

13:06.410 --> 13:09.814
Huh?
That can't be good.

13:10.949 --> 13:12.249
It never is.

13:12.316 --> 13:14.785
This seems to be
some kind of storybook.

13:15.586 --> 13:16.387
Hmm.

13:18.957 --> 13:23.194
<i>"Once upon a time,
there was a great ruler named King Arthur.</i>

13:23.260 --> 13:27.431
<i>But this king was under attack
from the evil Morgan Le Fey.</i>

13:27.498 --> 13:29.433
<i>She demanded the throne
from King Arthur,</i>

13:29.500 --> 13:32.104
<i>but he would not give it up
to one as evil as her.</i>

13:32.169 --> 13:35.373
<i>Everything was hopeless
until Sir Norville appeared.</i>

13:35.439 --> 13:37.475
<i>Brandishing the mighty sword
Excalibur,</i>

13:37.541 --> 13:39.443
<i>Norville, through
a mighty tournament,</i>

13:39.510 --> 13:42.146
<i>became the rightful ruler
of Camelot.</i>

13:44.415 --> 13:46.183
<i>But no sooner
did he gain the throne</i>

13:46.250 --> 13:48.786
<i>than Morgan Le Fey
attacked again.</i>

13:48.854 --> 13:51.023
<i>Norville was whisked away
to Morgan's castle</i>

13:51.089 --> 13:53.524
<i>where the two were
never heard from again.</i>

13:53.591 --> 13:57.728
<i>King Arthur decreed that if Sir
Norville or his children ever returned,</i>

13:57.795 --> 14:01.867
he would be crowned the rightful
ruler over all the land."

14:01.933 --> 14:04.702
No wonder it
was called the Dark Ages.

14:04.769 --> 14:07.906
Can you imagine
anyone believing such a story?

14:07.973 --> 14:09.206
Ha! Right, gang?

14:09.273 --> 14:11.475
Scooby? Shaggy?

14:11.542 --> 14:13.377
Is the story over?

14:16.213 --> 14:20.651
What do you know? The book was right.
This is a great hiding place.

14:30.862 --> 14:32.730
Hey. Where's the party?

14:35.199 --> 14:38.335
If ever you see a party not happening,
that means you're the party.

14:38.402 --> 14:40.705
Come on, gang.
Let's heat this place back up.

14:52.550 --> 14:54.452
Come on. If you dance it,
they will come.

14:54.518 --> 14:56.054
No.

15:00.959 --> 15:03.728
It's working.
Come on, party people.

15:04.930 --> 15:08.566
Like, don't party people
usually arrive by land?

15:08.632 --> 15:10.434
Not if it's a skydiving party.

15:10.501 --> 15:12.871
Excuse me. Are you
the skydiving instructor?

15:12.938 --> 15:17.109
I am Morgan Le Fey,
rightful ruler of Camelot.

15:17.175 --> 15:22.047
And if it wasn't for meddling Sir
Norville, I would be ruler still.

15:22.114 --> 15:23.849
Why is she pointing at me?

15:23.915 --> 15:25.616
Are you not
the skydiving instructor?

15:25.683 --> 15:29.921
Now, I shall finally
have my revenge!

15:29.988 --> 15:31.822
You'll have to
catch us first.

15:34.325 --> 15:35.593
Come on, gang!

15:42.234 --> 15:43.334
A-ha!

16:04.856 --> 16:07.159
That was so not a party person.

16:07.225 --> 16:09.094
What was that thing?

16:09.161 --> 16:13.564
She said she was the ghost of Morgan
Le Fey, but that's just preposterous.

16:13.631 --> 16:17.002
On a scale of one to...

16:17.068 --> 16:19.237
How preposterous
did you think it was?

16:19.303 --> 16:21.940
Check it out, gang.
It's an old henge.

16:22.007 --> 16:26.278
A circle of stones that once held
some sort of mystical significance.

16:26.343 --> 16:27.711
Look at that.

16:30.148 --> 16:32.716
Wow! Who do you think that is?

16:34.152 --> 16:37.822
It says this is the statue of
the legendary Sir Norville.

16:39.858 --> 16:43.627
Did someone say "Sir Norville"?
I despise Sir Norville.

16:43.694 --> 16:45.997
Well, good news, man.
I'm not him.

16:46.064 --> 16:48.900
I'm Shaggy, and, like,
everyone loves me.

16:48.967 --> 16:50.068
No joke.

16:50.135 --> 16:53.571
There is no time for love.
Only retribution.

16:54.805 --> 16:58.210
I invoke sorcery's paradigm.

16:58.276 --> 17:02.746
With this eldritch and mystical
rhyme, I'll leave them bipedal,

17:02.813 --> 17:07.986
but teach them to meddle and send
their butts backward in time.

17:11.056 --> 17:13.124
I'm scared, Shaggy.

17:14.758 --> 17:18.163
Me too, buddy.

17:18.230 --> 17:22.499
- Is anyone else getting a bit...
- tired?

17:22.566 --> 17:26.037
Tired? Oh, yeah.

18:15.220 --> 18:18.422
Shaggy, where are we?

18:18.489 --> 18:21.159
Like, I don't know, man.

18:21.226 --> 18:23.261
Shaggy, Scooby, grab my hand.

18:30.402 --> 18:33.171
We appear to be falling at the
standard 9.8 meters per second

18:33.238 --> 18:35.907
as dictated by the Earth's
gravity, but where's the ground?

18:35.974 --> 18:38.243
Skydiving's not a party, man.

18:38.310 --> 18:39.177
I found the ground!

18:42.147 --> 18:43.480
Brace for impact!

18:45.183 --> 18:46.217
Huh?

18:47.285 --> 18:48.819
Did we make it in one piece?

18:48.887 --> 18:52.523
I can't feel my legs.

18:55.360 --> 18:59.563
Like, I can feel my legs,
but I can't feel my fingers feeling them.

19:05.569 --> 19:07.238
Where are we?

19:12.576 --> 19:16.081
No bars. We should've gotten
the international plan.

19:17.983 --> 19:20.818
Did I leave my curling iron on
in 1,600 years?

19:20.885 --> 19:23.188
Morgan Le Fey
cast a spell on us.

19:23.254 --> 19:24.956
Oh, come on.

19:25.023 --> 19:28.226
I'm sure that was just some
kids playing some kind of prank.

19:28.293 --> 19:29.995
Velma, look around.

19:30.061 --> 19:32.730
You're telling me that there's
no way time travel could happen?

19:32.796 --> 19:36.968
Well, I mean, wormholes,
black holes, Tipler cylinders.

19:37.035 --> 19:39.471
But these are cosmic-level
events we're talking about.

19:39.536 --> 19:43.975
So, like not fantasy, but science fiction?
Like Thundarr?

19:44.042 --> 19:47.379
No. Thundarr's more
dumb fantasy than sci-fi.

19:47.445 --> 19:48.947
But you like Thundarr.

19:49.014 --> 19:52.083
I like Thundarr's abs, okay?
I watch it for the abs.

19:52.150 --> 19:53.485
Me too.

19:53.550 --> 19:55.353
So, wait. We time-traveled?

19:55.420 --> 19:58.423
Welp, gang, it looks like we
have another mystery on our...

19:58.490 --> 20:00.591
No. Not a mystery.
It's a hoax.

20:00.657 --> 20:01.893
Then how did we time-travel?

20:01.960 --> 20:03.627
We did not time-travel.

20:03.694 --> 20:05.864
This is a prank,
or a Japanese game show.

20:05.930 --> 20:08.699
We all just need to chill
and take a deep breath...

20:10.734 --> 20:12.337
...and hold our horses.

20:15.706 --> 20:17.342
Hmm.

20:17.409 --> 20:19.411
You gotta admit,
Velma's usually right about this stuff.

20:19.477 --> 20:23.915
Let's all just wait here
a bit and see what... Gang.

20:23.982 --> 20:26.351
Gang. Gang. Gang. Gang.

20:26.418 --> 20:27.718
Gang.

20:27.785 --> 20:30.121
It's real.

20:55.346 --> 20:59.017
This can't be real.
It doesn't make sense.

20:59.084 --> 21:01.219
This shouldn't be possible.

21:01.286 --> 21:04.255
If I'd known I was gonna time-travel,
I'd have brought my good ascot.

21:04.322 --> 21:07.992
I keep telling y'all,
reality is just a simulation.

21:08.059 --> 21:10.061
Now's not the time
to worry about what's real.

21:10.128 --> 21:14.199
That time is in, like, hundreds and
hundreds of years, where we should be.

21:14.265 --> 21:16.800
Well, gang, it looks like we
have another mystery on our...

21:16.868 --> 21:18.203
Ah, just you wait.

21:18.269 --> 21:20.004
Any second now,
someone's going to pop out

21:20.071 --> 21:22.140
and yell "Surprise"
or blow a horn.

21:25.609 --> 21:27.011
Ha! Horn!

21:28.712 --> 21:31.815
Hear ye! Hear ye!

21:31.883 --> 21:33.384
I, Herald of the court,

21:33.451 --> 21:36.653
doth ask you to bow
before the King of Camelot.

21:36.720 --> 21:39.224
The lord of the land.
The knight of the...

21:39.290 --> 21:40.724
Oh, get on with it.

21:40.791 --> 21:42.594
Yes. Um...

21:42.659 --> 21:48.166
Peasants and serfs, I give you
King Arthur and Queen Guinevere.

21:52.036 --> 21:54.038
Ohh. He's kinda hunky.

21:54.105 --> 21:57.008
I guess, if you're into
authoritarian dictators.

21:57.075 --> 21:59.643
He kinda reminds me
of my dad.

22:01.212 --> 22:05.950
Sorry. Sorry. New cape.
Haven't broken it in yet.

22:09.720 --> 22:11.923
Say, he sure looks familiar.

22:11.990 --> 22:18.463
Unwashed common people, I, your king,
and my brave Knights of the Round Table

22:18.530 --> 22:23.968
have with great effort and sacrifice
finally defeated the villainous Saxons

22:24.035 --> 22:26.004
and brought peace
to the isles.

22:26.070 --> 22:27.972
I love your hair.

22:28.039 --> 22:31.409
So, I'm throwing a party!

22:34.179 --> 22:37.482
Uh... It's not a party
for you lot.

22:37.549 --> 22:40.485
It's for me. The rightful king
of the Britons,

22:40.552 --> 22:43.955
who made you the proud people
you are today.

22:44.022 --> 22:47.492
Back straight. Chin up.
Mind the gap.

22:47.559 --> 22:50.694
Now, I'm going to have
my Knights of the Round Table

22:50.761 --> 22:53.364
come around
and collect some taxes.

22:59.304 --> 23:00.438
Come on. Pony up.

23:00.505 --> 23:03.441
Oh, and, Lancelot,
I'll take that pony.

23:06.678 --> 23:08.880
He is like your dad.
A big meanie.

23:08.947 --> 23:12.183
The unwashed common people don't
seem to like him very much.

23:12.250 --> 23:14.852
Oh, my gosh.
You're right, Daph.

23:14.919 --> 23:16.588
All right. Good talk.

23:16.654 --> 23:18.323
Oh!

23:21.226 --> 23:23.528
Oh, not again.

23:23.595 --> 23:25.563
Greetings, Arthur.

23:25.630 --> 23:28.099
It is I, Morgan Le Fey.

23:28.166 --> 23:32.403
Come to take my rightful place
as ruler of Camelot.

23:34.372 --> 23:35.940
Like, it's her!

23:40.211 --> 23:43.181
Wend home to Avalon,
vile enchantress.

23:43.248 --> 23:48.219
You call your folk fair,
yet I judge you anything but.

23:51.122 --> 23:53.625
Oh, my gosh. Really? Really?

23:53.691 --> 23:56.760
Ah. Ah, sorry. Sorry.

23:56.828 --> 23:58.229
I had butter for lunch.

23:58.296 --> 24:01.399
Cede the throne to me,
son of Uther Pendragon,

24:01.466 --> 24:04.035
and I shall spare
your miserable life.

24:04.102 --> 24:06.704
Uh, my life
is amazing, FYI.

24:06.770 --> 24:08.373
Yeah. Shazing.

24:08.439 --> 24:11.376
And also, I'm hiding
behind my knights.

24:11.442 --> 24:15.246
You'd have to literally
tear them apart to get to me.

24:19.050 --> 24:23.855
Well, if you won't give me the
throne, I'll just have to take it.

24:26.057 --> 24:27.759
Oh!

24:30.094 --> 24:33.131
King down. King down, everyone.

24:45.410 --> 24:46.477
Huh?

24:55.219 --> 25:00.124
Soon you will all bow before
me, your true queen!

25:03.961 --> 25:05.229
Huh?

25:06.564 --> 25:09.400
It's just like the book
we read in the library.

25:09.467 --> 25:10.668
What do you mean?

25:10.735 --> 25:12.470
Remember when Velma was like,
"Blah blah blah.

25:12.537 --> 25:15.907
Morgan Le Fey kept on annoying
Norville o'er Morgania"?

25:15.973 --> 25:19.444
That's right.
Until Sir Norville appeared.

25:19.510 --> 25:21.212
Sir Norville.

25:21.279 --> 25:23.147
- That's it!
- Huh? What's it?

25:23.214 --> 25:25.016
Why are you looking
at me like that?

25:25.083 --> 25:30.822
Because maybe Sir Norville is
actually Shaggy sent back in time.

25:30.888 --> 25:33.491
Me? A knight?
With this goatee?

25:33.558 --> 25:36.527
Besides, I don't look
anything like the statue.

25:36.594 --> 25:39.464
Oh, so now you're on the
time-travel train too, Velma?

25:39.530 --> 25:41.834
You said it yourself, Daphne.
Science fiction.

25:41.899 --> 25:45.169
Any sufficiently advanced technology
is indistinguishable from magic.

25:45.236 --> 25:47.605
We do seem to have
traveled in time.

25:47.672 --> 25:49.540
We just need
to find out how.

25:49.607 --> 25:51.376
You can say it now.

25:51.442 --> 25:55.246
Well, gang, it looks like we have
another mystery on our hands.

25:55.313 --> 25:57.215
If we're in the distant past,

25:57.281 --> 25:59.450
then we're currently living out the
legend we read about in the future.

25:59.517 --> 26:01.552
Oh, my brain hurts.

26:01.619 --> 26:03.588
And if we're responsible
for the legend,

26:03.654 --> 26:05.923
then we have to do
exactly what it said,

26:05.990 --> 26:07.860
or otherwise we'll mess up
the timeline,

26:07.925 --> 26:09.727
which could cause us
to cease to exist,

26:09.794 --> 26:13.765
or worse, the whole universe may
implode in a quantum paradox.

26:13.832 --> 26:16.200
I'm telling you,
reality's a simulation, girl.

26:16.267 --> 26:18.569
The universe can't implode
'cause it isn't even real.

26:18.636 --> 26:20.938
Daphne, you're not helping
my stomach.

26:21.005 --> 26:22.407
I look at you guys
and I just see

26:22.473 --> 26:25.276
zero-one, one-one-zero-
one-one-one-zero.

26:25.343 --> 26:28.346
Daph. Daph.
Hand me your phone.

26:29.580 --> 26:30.849
Look.

26:30.915 --> 26:32.650
As long as the lock-screen
picture stays the same,

26:32.717 --> 26:34.652
then it means we haven't
changed the timeline.

26:34.719 --> 26:37.722
So, all we have to do is keep
to the legend and we'll be fine.

26:37.789 --> 26:40.191
- Mm-hmm.
- So, what do we do next?

26:40.258 --> 26:44.228
I've got an idea, but we're going to
need to find more appropriate attire

26:44.295 --> 26:46.731
so we don't stick out
like sore thumbs.

26:56.140 --> 26:57.508
Oh!

27:00.311 --> 27:04.115
Funniest thing
I've seen all night.

27:13.691 --> 27:15.359
Hear ye! Hear ye!

27:15.426 --> 27:20.031
Presenting Sir Norville of
Crystal Covia and his entourage.

27:25.136 --> 27:28.506
Like, I, Sir Norville
of Crystal Cove...

27:28.573 --> 27:29.875
Ia!

27:29.942 --> 27:34.679
Crystal Covia,
do present myself before thy king.

27:34.745 --> 27:36.481
Crystal Covia? Hmm.

27:36.547 --> 27:38.816
Sounds very new-agey.
Very "witchy."

27:38.884 --> 27:42.153
Where is it? What do they wear?
Is it clothes?

27:42.220 --> 27:45.056
Uh, Crystal Covia lies
far across the sea.

27:45.122 --> 27:49.026
We have great treasures,
like malt shops and Taco Tuesdays.

27:49.093 --> 27:50.761
- And...
- Taco Wednesdays.

27:50.829 --> 27:52.463
Taco Wednesdays.

27:52.530 --> 27:54.967
And yes, we mostly wear clothes.
But sometimes also food.

27:55.032 --> 27:56.634
They're slobs.

27:56.701 --> 28:01.072
This sounds like witchcraft
to me. Right? Eh? Am I right?

28:03.207 --> 28:05.878
Yeah, yeah. All right then.
Show it to me.

28:05.944 --> 28:08.412
Let's see it. Bring it on.
Show me the witchcraft.

28:08.479 --> 28:10.281
Your Highness, there is
no such thing as...

28:10.348 --> 28:11.850
I know witchcraft.

28:11.917 --> 28:16.120
Where I'm from, I was
taught by 1,000 sand-witches.

28:17.755 --> 28:19.824
And I'd like to
put you under the spell

28:19.892 --> 28:23.628
of a beast from 1,500 years
in your future.

28:23.694 --> 28:24.897
The Hoagie!

28:24.963 --> 28:27.298
Scooby, let's make history.

28:38.543 --> 28:41.345
Now, all we need
is a knife to cut it with.

28:41.412 --> 28:43.080
Shaggy.

28:44.315 --> 28:46.050
That'll work perfectly.

28:47.285 --> 28:50.388
I love your knife holder.
Very rustic.

29:00.131 --> 29:04.036
And, like, that's what I call
a Super Shaggy Sandwich.

29:09.674 --> 29:13.946
Whoa. Hey, I know it's an amazing
sandwich, but come on.

29:14.012 --> 29:15.746
It's just like the legend.

29:15.813 --> 29:18.583
You just pulled Excalibur
from the stone.

29:18.649 --> 29:21.485
That makes you
the rightful heir to Camelot.

29:21.552 --> 29:24.355
Whoa. Whoa, whoa.
Whoa there, buster.

29:24.422 --> 29:26.223
Pump the horse brakes,
all right?

29:26.290 --> 29:30.561
Pulling an old hunk of metal from
a rock doesn't make one a leader.

29:30.628 --> 29:33.497
It literally says,
"Whosoever pulls the sword

29:33.564 --> 29:36.300
from the stone shall be
the rightful king of Camelot."

29:36.367 --> 29:39.537
You come in here with
your sand-witchcraft,

29:39.604 --> 29:42.807
steal my sword, and try
to take my throne as well?

29:42.874 --> 29:47.111
That, good sir, or madam,
is just plain rude.

29:47.178 --> 29:50.481
I ought to give you a taste
of Camelot's just desserts.

29:50.548 --> 29:51.816
Hold on, boys.

29:51.883 --> 29:54.019
There has to be
a way we can settle this.

29:54.086 --> 29:56.420
- I'm cool with pie.
- Oh, we will.

29:56.487 --> 29:59.925
We will settle this. Like men!

29:59.992 --> 30:01.425
<i>Hold!</i>

30:02.094 --> 30:03.394
Huh?

30:08.799 --> 30:10.068
Who's that?

30:10.134 --> 30:12.470
It's me. I'm Merlin.

30:12.536 --> 30:13.704
Merlin?

30:13.771 --> 30:15.406
Merlin? Where?

30:17.708 --> 30:19.310
Ah, yes. Me again.

30:19.377 --> 30:23.381
I'm Merlin the Magician,
master of knowledge and mystical secrets.

30:23.447 --> 30:27.485
Merlin, you're always spoiling
my fun. Just like my mum.

30:27.551 --> 30:30.454
- Beard and all.
- Hmm.

30:30.521 --> 30:32.323
If there's one thing
I can't stand,

30:32.390 --> 30:34.792
it's adulty people
acting like children.

30:38.696 --> 30:40.899
All this noisy arguing is
what brought me down here.

30:40.966 --> 30:44.002
I'm a busy wizard
and I need to focus, right?

30:44.069 --> 30:46.038
Sorry, Mr. Merlin.

30:46.104 --> 30:48.539
But our friend Shaggy here pulled the
sword from the stone, so technically...

30:51.409 --> 30:53.744
Yeah. How can there be
two kings at one time?

30:53.811 --> 30:57.548
Uh, well, there can't be, can there?
Hmm? You bunch of numpties.

30:57.615 --> 31:00.651
You gotta solve this like
the adulty people you are.

31:04.588 --> 31:07.792
With a winner-take-all melee
for the crown!

31:11.863 --> 31:13.397
Hear ye! Hear ye!

31:13.464 --> 31:15.100
To determine
the true king,

31:15.167 --> 31:18.569
the prospects must test
their skill upon one another.

31:18.636 --> 31:22.273
The champion becoming
the king of Camelot!

31:24.809 --> 31:26.711
Like, I'm gonna
have to compete?

31:26.777 --> 31:29.948
Because, to be honest,
I'm pretty sure you could take me.

31:31.983 --> 31:33.751
We're nobility.

31:33.818 --> 31:35.954
Nobility doesn't
fight one another.

31:36.021 --> 31:39.690
We get the unwashed commoners
to fight on our behalf.

31:39.757 --> 31:41.225
Phew.

31:41.292 --> 31:45.362
Us, sweating? Waving our arms around?
Can you imagine?

31:45.429 --> 31:46.764
Drumstick?

31:46.832 --> 31:48.967
Looks like you boys
have got this sorted.

31:49.034 --> 31:51.335
There's a whole arsenal
down there to choose from.

31:51.402 --> 31:54.973
Arsenal! Arsenal! Arsenal!

32:07.318 --> 32:09.286
Right then.
Let's get down to it.

32:09.353 --> 32:13.657
I choose, uh, Sir Galahad.

32:17.062 --> 32:18.763
Um, I choose...

32:18.830 --> 32:20.999
Hold on, mate.
I'm not done yet.

32:21.066 --> 32:25.636
Sir Percival, Sir Tristan,
Gawain, Sir Kay, Sir Kay, Sir...

32:25.703 --> 32:27.738
What if... Could I...
I was... Could I, please...

32:27.805 --> 32:29.473
Bedivere,
Sir Kay...

32:29.540 --> 32:31.742
- Sir...
- And I want that pony.

32:33.011 --> 32:34.578
- I'll take...
- Um...

32:34.645 --> 32:35.646
- Bors the Younger.
- It would be great...

32:35.713 --> 32:36.781
Sir Lamorak...

32:36.848 --> 32:38.482
- I choose...
- And...

32:43.855 --> 32:46.657
Hmm? Hmm? Hmm?

32:54.398 --> 32:57.035
Fine. I guess. Sir Lancelot.

32:57.836 --> 32:58.937
Yes!

33:01.505 --> 33:03.909
Like, I'd like a knight
to fight for right,

33:03.975 --> 33:06.310
but there isn't
one in sight.

33:07.812 --> 33:10.781
I, Fred of Ascot,

33:10.849 --> 33:14.318
do volunteer to fight
on Sir Norville's behalf.

33:14.385 --> 33:16.453
Are you sure
you're up for this, Fred?

33:16.520 --> 33:17.989
You're a big tough guy,

33:18.056 --> 33:20.758
but those are
crazy-ripped man-men.

33:24.428 --> 33:25.964
For sure, Daph.

33:26.031 --> 33:28.399
As long as you're there
to cheer me on, we'll be fine.

33:28.465 --> 33:32.803
Besides, the way I figure it,
according to legend, we've already won.

33:32.871 --> 33:34.371
What's there
to be afraid of?

33:36.141 --> 33:41.512
The Black Plague. Deranged highwaymen.
Giant brown bears.

33:41.579 --> 33:44.748
Dysentery.
Armies of angry orcs...

33:50.088 --> 33:53.657
Just the one, eh?

33:54.825 --> 33:57.262
At least your mum thinks
you're cool.

33:57.329 --> 34:00.232
Come on, Velma. Find a way
to get us out of here.

34:00.298 --> 34:03.935
I'm on it. If anyone knows
what's up here, it's Merlin.

34:43.741 --> 34:46.744
- Merlin?
- Oh. Hello.

34:46.810 --> 34:51.116
Sorry. I didn't hear you come
in over my burping fire and all.

34:56.354 --> 34:59.124
Um, I've come
seeking knowledge.

34:59.190 --> 35:03.929
Oh. You must be my sister Karen's friend.
I can teach you.

35:03.995 --> 35:06.998
- Uh...
- Oh, that's fantastic.

35:07.065 --> 35:09.234
You know, Karen's the one
that gave me the idea.

35:09.301 --> 35:11.970
She's like "Can you breathe
fire?" And I'm like "Yes."

35:12.037 --> 35:14.005
And then she's like,
"But can you belch the alphabet?"

35:14.072 --> 35:16.507
And I'm like,
"Oh, my gosh. Yes, I can."

35:16.573 --> 35:20.211
Why has no one ever combined
these two things before?

35:20.278 --> 35:25.749
A, B, C, D, E,
F, G.

35:26.617 --> 35:28.719
I'm getting stuck on the G.

35:28.786 --> 35:33.757
Hey, Merlin, or whoever you want
to call yourself, I'm having a day.

35:33.824 --> 35:36.560
That's what
tea's for, my darling.

35:40.298 --> 35:43.969
I think you might have
a time machine or something.

35:44.035 --> 35:45.569
A device...

35:45.636 --> 35:47.305
Okay.
Maybe you call it "magic."

35:47.372 --> 35:49.274
Whatever it is,
I need to learn how to use it

35:49.341 --> 35:51.876
so I can send my friends
and myself back home.

35:51.943 --> 35:55.180
Oh. So you want to be
a sorcerer's assistant, huh?

35:55.246 --> 35:59.184
To learn the arcane secrets what
make the world turn like a platter.

35:59.250 --> 36:02.720
Then this is where your quest
for knowledge begins.

36:04.555 --> 36:06.958
Uh, what am I supposed
to do with this?

36:07.025 --> 36:10.895
When the time comes,
you will know what to do with it.

36:10.962 --> 36:14.399
Can't I just have access
to your time machine?

36:14.466 --> 36:17.268
Oh. Is that all you wanted?

36:17.335 --> 36:20.804
I call it a "sun dial."

36:20.872 --> 36:24.175
Ugh. I'm gonna need magic
just to get through this day.

36:28.880 --> 36:30.714
Well, how do I look?

36:30.781 --> 36:33.584
Like my knight
in shining armor.

36:35.519 --> 36:37.654
Mine, too.

36:37.721 --> 36:41.092
Thanks, Scoob.
Well, time to go.

36:43.228 --> 36:45.196
Oh, I think not.

36:45.263 --> 36:46.697
Morgan!

36:46.764 --> 36:49.800
- Why, I ought to...
- Freeze!

36:52.437 --> 36:54.638
I... I can't move.

36:55.306 --> 36:56.707
Let him go.

36:56.774 --> 36:59.044
Don't worry.
It's only temporary.

36:59.110 --> 37:02.080
But long enough
to stop him from competing.

37:02.147 --> 37:06.184
Now nothing can stop me from
taking the throne from Arthur.

37:12.090 --> 37:15.126
- What are we gonna do?
- Fred can't joust like this.

37:15.193 --> 37:16.660
He'll have to forfeit,

37:16.727 --> 37:19.297
and King Arthur will win,
which means we might...

37:19.364 --> 37:21.199
Poof. Disappear.

37:21.266 --> 37:25.003
No. We have to give Velma
more time to figure things out.

37:25.070 --> 37:29.407
I've got a plan.
A plan so crazy it might just work.

37:29.474 --> 37:33.211
Fred! Fred! Fred!

37:34.879 --> 37:37.048
Uh, where's your knight?

37:37.115 --> 37:38.950
Uh, I don't know.

37:48.993 --> 37:51.162
Is that
a lady on a horse?

37:51.229 --> 37:53.131
Is that a non-man?

37:53.198 --> 37:56.201
No. That's Daphne.
Where's Fred?

37:56.267 --> 37:58.702
Felled by dark magic.
I'm standing in.

37:58.769 --> 38:02.207
A non-man
doing sporty man things?

38:02.273 --> 38:03.308
That's a laugh, isn't it?

38:03.374 --> 38:05.910
Ha! Well, Norville,
after you lose,

38:05.977 --> 38:07.846
maybe I can find a job
for you on my staff.

38:07.912 --> 38:10.714
What are your thoughts
on waste removal?

38:10.781 --> 38:12.816
I've got a few
ripe buckets of...

38:12.884 --> 38:15.453
Actually, King Arthur,
in my land, non-men...

38:15.520 --> 38:18.622
Uh, women can do whatever
they put their minds to.

38:18.689 --> 38:20.492
And some of them
are pretty scary.

39:21.853 --> 39:24.255
Smite him, Daph!

39:24.322 --> 39:27.258
Smite that knight
right in the snoot.

39:27.325 --> 39:29.527
Daphne! Daphne!

39:29.594 --> 39:32.430
Daphne! Daphne! Daphne!

39:33.598 --> 39:34.933
Daphne, look out!

39:42.607 --> 39:46.211
You fight like a girl,
so I'll go easy on you.

39:51.683 --> 39:54.319
Oh, I was just dodging.
Was I supposed to be fighting?

39:54.385 --> 39:57.255
Look, little girl, first off,
you're skinny as a...

40:02.927 --> 40:05.129
- Stick.
- Don't worry.

40:05.196 --> 40:07.098
Those dents will
buff right out.

40:07.165 --> 40:09.567
Yes! Yes! Yes!

40:09.634 --> 40:14.305
Lancelot just got beat
by a girl!

40:14.372 --> 40:16.941
That's a point for you.
But so worth it.

40:17.008 --> 40:19.344
- Cheese?
- Cheese.

40:19.410 --> 40:20.311
Mmm.

40:21.879 --> 40:24.682
Sir Daphne, you're my
knight in shining armor.

40:24.748 --> 40:27.652
Daphne! Daphne!

40:46.504 --> 40:48.306
Rah! Huzzah!

41:00.585 --> 41:01.919
Yes!

41:01.986 --> 41:03.621
Peanuts.
Anybody want peanuts?

41:03.688 --> 41:05.822
Gimme two.
I don't carry money.

41:18.469 --> 41:22.340
This is it. He's the last
knight on Arthur's side.

41:22.407 --> 41:26.944
I want Daph to win, but, you know,
I also kinda want her to lose.

41:27.011 --> 41:28.513
Go get him, Daph.

41:30.114 --> 41:31.815
Here. For luck.

41:34.185 --> 41:36.054
Go get him, Daphne.

41:37.855 --> 41:40.091
Oh. I can't look.

41:53.938 --> 41:55.573
Oh, no.

41:55.640 --> 41:57.375
- I won!
- You won!

41:57.442 --> 42:00.311
Ugh! This is the worst
thing that's ever happened.

42:00.378 --> 42:01.846
At last!

42:03.948 --> 42:09.120
Now, with the king chosen, I have
sent an emissary to bring him to me.

42:18.696 --> 42:24.502
As I perform this ancient rite,
it will cause a big, terrible fight.

42:24.569 --> 42:28.573
As swords clash and clang,
you'll go out with a bang!

42:28.639 --> 42:34.145
As you're slain by my wicked Black Knight!

42:49.927 --> 42:51.929
Like, what is that?

42:51.996 --> 42:54.031
That is your doom.

42:54.098 --> 42:56.835
Black Knight, attack!

43:01.038 --> 43:03.574
Well, that's a bit excessive.

43:21.426 --> 43:22.593
Huh?

43:27.900 --> 43:29.066
Finish her!

43:29.133 --> 43:31.002
Not so fast.

43:35.506 --> 43:39.177
Velma, you're back.
And you've learned the wizarding ways.

43:39.243 --> 43:41.145
Look. She's got
magic pajamas.

43:41.212 --> 43:43.281
Yeah, Merlin gave
me these robes,

43:43.347 --> 43:45.483
but I didn't learn
squat up there.

43:45.550 --> 43:47.985
Magic is nonsense.

43:48.052 --> 43:51.857
I'm here to save you the new-fashioned way.
With science.

43:53.658 --> 43:55.293
It's all about physics.

43:55.359 --> 43:57.962
Abra-ka-whatever-
fantasy-nerds-say.

44:14.880 --> 44:18.349
An object in motion stays in motion
with the same speed and direction...

44:30.829 --> 44:34.198
...unless acted
upon by an unbalanced force.

44:36.734 --> 44:39.737
It's all you, Daph.
Let's unmask our villain.

44:39.804 --> 44:41.840
Shaggy, the sword.

44:41.907 --> 44:43.374
The sword?

44:46.010 --> 44:48.446
Daph, catch!

44:53.852 --> 44:56.320
And the Black
Knight is actually...

45:03.060 --> 45:04.128
Gross.

45:06.531 --> 45:09.935
Anyone have a spare helmet?
Or, like, a paper bag?

45:11.602 --> 45:14.105
Oh, come on. Come on, come on.
Gimme a break.

45:14.171 --> 45:16.207
I can't believe
I'm doing this.

45:17.708 --> 45:20.177
"When apprentices
fail at their quest,

45:20.244 --> 45:21.980
and they just didn't
give it their best.

45:22.046 --> 45:24.983
When there's trouble with
magic, don't let it turn tragic.

45:25.049 --> 45:27.385
Just call Merlin.
He's at your behest."

45:28.954 --> 45:30.254
Is all magic limericks?

45:36.895 --> 45:40.698
Ooh. Looks like we've gotten ourselves
into a bit of a barney, haven't we? Hmm?

45:42.600 --> 45:43.768
Heh. Barney.

45:43.835 --> 45:45.871
Like Barney Rubble.
It rhymes with trouble.

45:45.938 --> 45:49.574
Wait. How do you know about Barney Rubble?
He's from the future.

45:49.640 --> 45:51.676
He's a caveman.

45:55.981 --> 45:57.148
Merlin! Help!

45:57.214 --> 45:58.549
Oh, bother.

46:08.092 --> 46:10.494
Whoa!

46:10.561 --> 46:12.263
How do I learn
how to do that?

46:12.330 --> 46:13.598
He says it's magic.

46:13.664 --> 46:15.232
But I'm building a case
that he's actually

46:15.299 --> 46:17.635
some sort of super-genius
from the 27th century.

46:17.702 --> 46:19.838
Ray guns.
Molecular transportation.

46:23.741 --> 46:25.176
Or, you know...

46:25.242 --> 46:26.979
Ah, young apprentice.

46:27.045 --> 46:29.714
You must study even harder if
you're to become a proper wizard.

46:29.780 --> 46:32.583
Study what? The stuff in
this book is nonsense.

46:32.650 --> 46:34.752
I just want to
time-travel back home.

46:34.819 --> 46:37.055
This is all just bad
limericks and gobbledygook.

46:37.121 --> 46:40.859
To a wizard, gobbledygook is
the most important kind of gook.

46:40.926 --> 46:45.296
When the time is right, young lad,
you'll know just how to use that book.

46:45.363 --> 46:47.032
But, please, Merlin.
I just have to...

46:52.470 --> 46:54.906
Second-hand wizard.
Ought to be illegal.

46:54.973 --> 46:56.474
What a show
that guy puts on.

46:56.540 --> 46:57.843
Come on.

46:57.909 --> 46:59.610
We just want to use
your time-travel machine

46:59.677 --> 47:02.279
so we can go home and watch
<i>Thundarr the Barbarian.</i>

47:02.346 --> 47:03.714
Ugh! Timeline.

47:06.084 --> 47:10.088
Wizard-speak for
"I promise to study harder."

47:10.154 --> 47:11.722
I guess that's that.

47:11.789 --> 47:13.357
I think not!

47:15.159 --> 47:16.827
Like, what's happening, man?

47:18.897 --> 47:21.732
Since you are the rightful
king, then you are mine.

47:21.799 --> 47:23.768
Farewell, you miscreants.

47:23.835 --> 47:28.205
When next we meet,
it will be your doom!

47:30.876 --> 47:33.778
Shaggy!

47:37.615 --> 47:40.018
Don't worry, Scoob.
We'll get him back.

47:40.085 --> 47:41.485
We better hurry. Look.

47:41.552 --> 47:43.587
Our future is fading
out of existence.

47:43.654 --> 47:46.590
If we don't find out where Shaggy
went, we'll cease to be,

47:46.657 --> 47:49.193
creating a time paradox
that will destroy the world.

47:50.862 --> 47:53.798
Ooh, ooh, ooh. I know this one.
Uh, I know where he went.

47:53.865 --> 47:56.734
To Morgan's Keep.
Not far from here.

47:56.801 --> 47:58.402
Really creepy.

47:58.469 --> 48:00.204
And there's a gauntlet
of deadly traps

48:00.271 --> 48:02.273
before you can even
get inside.

48:02.339 --> 48:03.374
Did someone say traps?

48:03.441 --> 48:05.376
Deadly traps?

48:05.443 --> 48:09.380
Mmm-hmm. Yeah. Deadly traps.
Awesome. Good luck.

48:09.447 --> 48:10.815
Hope you get
your mate back.

48:10.882 --> 48:12.349
He's your friend, too.

48:12.416 --> 48:17.321
I don't need a mate.
I'm a king. I have hoagies.

48:17.388 --> 48:19.557
Uh, hoagies!

48:22.861 --> 48:25.262
How can you eat
at a time like this?

48:25.329 --> 48:29.868
Yeah. Even Scooby knows that when a friend's
in trouble, you drop everything for them.

48:29.935 --> 48:31.002
Even snacks.

48:31.069 --> 48:35.239
I told you. Shaggy's not my...

48:55.459 --> 48:57.695
Shaggy is my mate.

48:57.762 --> 49:00.531
Or the closest I've got to one.

49:02.067 --> 49:05.203
My whole life is a lie.

49:05.269 --> 49:07.438
So you'll join the Scooby
Gang while we rescue him?

49:07.505 --> 49:11.776
No. Are you mad? I'm not leaving this
castle without a bunch of knights.

49:11.843 --> 49:14.146
Oh, no. I think
I broke them all.

49:16.181 --> 49:17.182
Hmm.

49:17.249 --> 49:18.282
I've got it.

49:18.349 --> 49:20.451
Um, kneel.

49:21.953 --> 49:26.958
I, Arthur Pendragon,
King of Camelot,

49:27.025 --> 49:30.494
and the rightful
wielder of Excalibur,

49:30.561 --> 49:34.565
do dub thee Knights
of the Round Table.

49:39.603 --> 49:43.008
Let's go and save our mate.

49:46.278 --> 49:48.213
I love your hair!

50:30.788 --> 50:33.959
So, this is it?
Huh. That's strange.

50:34.025 --> 50:35.593
What, Velma?

50:35.659 --> 50:38.163
Oh, nothing. I just could have
sworn we've been here before.

50:38.230 --> 50:42.766
Oh, you would remember if you had.
Welcome to Morgan's Keep.

50:42.834 --> 50:45.871
This cave leads down
into the bowels of the Earth,

50:45.937 --> 50:49.140
where Morgan Le Fey
practices her dark magic.

50:49.207 --> 50:51.542
Don't be scared, Scooby.

50:51.609 --> 50:53.777
Remember, we're here
to save Shaggy.

50:53.845 --> 50:57.448
Say, Arthur, how are we going
to get across that moat?

50:59.516 --> 51:01.752
Well,
that's not creepy.

51:05.656 --> 51:08.360
There. Down that corridor.

51:08.425 --> 51:09.961
What are we waiting for?

51:10.661 --> 51:11.863
Whoa!

51:15.200 --> 51:18.535
Oh, it's the gauntlet
of deadly traps.

51:18.602 --> 51:20.471
Oh, right. I forgot.

51:20.537 --> 51:23.774
Velma, can you get us across with
your powers as a student wizard?

51:23.842 --> 51:24.976
I can try.

51:25.043 --> 51:28.179
So silly.

51:28.246 --> 51:33.584
"I call on the powers of fable to
make passage for knights of the table.

51:33.651 --> 51:36.487
For this evil hallway
will attempt to fillet,

51:36.553 --> 51:39.423
cook or smash us
as long as it's able."

51:39.490 --> 51:41.860
- Did it work?
- I don't know.

51:45.529 --> 51:46.797
I guess not.

51:46.865 --> 51:48.699
Well, we gave
it a good go.

51:48.766 --> 51:51.435
If we head back now, we'll be just
in time for tea and jellied eels.

51:51.502 --> 51:52.736
We can't leave.

51:52.803 --> 51:54.839
Then what are
we gonna do?

51:54.906 --> 51:58.542
You're the master of traps, Fred.
You can figure this out.

52:23.835 --> 52:26.737
Am I a wizard?
No. Am I an artist?

52:29.473 --> 52:31.376
I, uh, hadn't really
thought about it.

52:31.443 --> 52:33.044
Sorry. What does
this do again?

52:33.111 --> 52:36.513
I used the bow we brought
with us to make a trebuchet

52:36.580 --> 52:40.285
that will throw a stone through
the hallway, pulling the sled,

52:40.352 --> 52:43.721
which will slide us past the traps
before they're able to do anything.

52:43.787 --> 52:46.324
It's an antitrap trap.

52:46.391 --> 52:48.659
Brilliant. We're all gonna die.

52:48.726 --> 52:50.962
- Ready, gang?
- Ready!

53:42.213 --> 53:45.450
Well, and Bob's your uncle.
We made it.

53:45.517 --> 53:48.253
Sir Fred, you are
a regular anorak.

53:48.319 --> 53:52.257
Actually, I think I'm half-Dutch
or Norway-ese or something.

53:57.128 --> 54:00.065
Huh?

54:10.241 --> 54:12.810
I knew you could do it.

54:12.877 --> 54:15.579
Thanks, guys, but come on.
We've gotta save Shaggy.

54:20.985 --> 54:21.953
Huh?

54:39.070 --> 54:41.239
Sorry. What's that
horrible noise?

54:41.306 --> 54:44.309
- More deadly traps?
- It's Shaggy.

54:53.318 --> 54:56.254
Scooby-Doo. It's great
to see you, pal.

54:56.321 --> 55:00.391
- Shaggy, are you all right?
- I am now that you're here.

55:00.458 --> 55:02.793
Hors d'oeuvres?

55:02.861 --> 55:04.596
Come on. We gotta
get out of here.

55:04.661 --> 55:08.900
He has a point. Waste not, want not.
That's what I always say.

55:09.666 --> 55:11.035
Stand back.

55:21.412 --> 55:23.780
Oh.

55:52.776 --> 55:56.481
- Now can we go?
- Yep. Food's gone.

55:57.649 --> 55:58.883
It's too late.

55:58.950 --> 56:01.052
The picture. It's gone.

56:01.119 --> 56:03.754
Whatever we did,
we just made the timeline worse.

56:03.820 --> 56:05.857
Now the phone
isn't even working,

56:05.924 --> 56:08.759
as if the technology
itself was disappearing.

56:08.825 --> 56:09.994
We've failed.

56:10.061 --> 56:11.963
Right, you are!

56:19.170 --> 56:21.272
Ha! Finally!

56:21.339 --> 56:23.575
Now with Excalibur
in my hand

56:23.641 --> 56:26.810
and Sir Norville having granted
me the deed to the throne...

56:26.878 --> 56:28.179
Deed to the throne?

56:28.246 --> 56:30.448
Yes. For as much food
as he could eat.

56:30.515 --> 56:33.551
It's all here.
Legal and everything.

56:33.618 --> 56:35.253
Shaggy, you didn't?

56:35.320 --> 56:37.222
Why would I want
a seat on the throne

56:37.288 --> 56:39.357
when I've got some tea and a scone?

56:39.424 --> 56:42.093
Now, with this deed
and the sword,

56:42.160 --> 56:47.865
I am the rightful ruler
of all of Camelot.

56:50.501 --> 56:51.735
Huh?

56:52.769 --> 56:54.672
Only if you can
hold onto it.

56:54.738 --> 56:58.176
You think you can
defeat me?

56:58.243 --> 57:01.346
I am the greatest
sorceress of all time,

57:01.412 --> 57:04.916
but this battle
is going to drag on.

57:04.983 --> 57:07.452
Drag on. Get it?

57:07.518 --> 57:09.220
This is my dumb little joke,

57:09.287 --> 57:12.290
since you all seem to like
making dumb little jokes so much.

57:15.326 --> 57:17.929
Uh-oh.
I don't like this pun.

57:22.066 --> 57:24.235
Dragon!

57:24.302 --> 57:26.738
Uh-oh. Oh.
That's not good.

57:26.803 --> 57:29.474
Oh! Oh!

57:38.883 --> 57:45.023
I am Morgan Le Fey, ruler of
Camelot, and I am hungry.

57:50.161 --> 57:52.864
Guys, this table
is built really well,

57:52.930 --> 57:54.899
but I don't think
it can take another blast.

57:59.604 --> 58:02.307
We're gonna need some real
magic to get us out of this one.

58:02.373 --> 58:04.142
Have you gotten
good yet, Velma?

58:04.208 --> 58:07.145
No. But I know one word that
always works for this gang.

58:11.649 --> 58:15.586
- What's that?
- Run! Follow me!

58:15.653 --> 58:20.391
Like, if you can't take the heat,
get out of the dragon's lair.

58:37.642 --> 58:40.511
You cannot escape me!

59:57.922 --> 1:00:01.192
Come on, King Arthur.
Put the dragons right behind us.

1:00:01.259 --> 1:00:03.995
Go, Shaggy.

1:00:04.061 --> 1:00:06.564
I can't hold this door forever.

1:00:07.198 --> 1:00:08.666
Jump, Shaggy!

1:00:14.138 --> 1:00:16.541
Demon dogs, Shaggy. Go!

1:00:28.219 --> 1:00:29.654
King Arthur.

1:00:29.720 --> 1:00:31.489
I'm sure he's fine.

1:00:48.339 --> 1:00:51.709
You thought you could
escape me, you fools.

1:00:51.776 --> 1:00:56.882
If you have any last words,
the time has come to use them.

1:00:56.949 --> 1:00:59.550
<i>When the time
is right, young lad,</i>

1:00:59.617 --> 1:01:02.453
<i>you'll know just
how to use that book.</i>

1:01:46.230 --> 1:01:51.435
Thank you. Because of you,
we can wake up to a brighter tomorrow.

1:01:51.502 --> 1:01:55.740
Tomorrow? Velma, the picture.
Has it come back?

1:01:57.742 --> 1:01:59.310
- Nope.
- Oh, no.

1:01:59.377 --> 1:02:01.312
You mean we've destroyed
the future?

1:02:01.379 --> 1:02:04.850
No more video games?
No more double cheeseburgers?

1:02:04.917 --> 1:02:07.019
No more Scooby Snacks?

1:02:10.254 --> 1:02:12.991
And no way to return home.

1:02:13.057 --> 1:02:14.525
Don't worry, Sir Fred.

1:02:14.592 --> 1:02:17.061
You can join me and
my Knights of the Round Table.

1:02:17.128 --> 1:02:18.496
All of you can.

1:02:18.563 --> 1:02:22.066
Together, we can make
the world a better place.

1:02:22.133 --> 1:02:24.569
Create a kingdom
where everyone is welcome

1:02:24.635 --> 1:02:27.405
as long as they fight
on the side of right.

1:02:27.471 --> 1:02:31.877
Together, we can make Camelot
a beacon on the hill,

1:02:31.944 --> 1:02:35.580
shining a light into
the darkest of places.

1:02:36.213 --> 1:02:38.884
Bravo. Bravo.

1:02:38.951 --> 1:02:40.585
Velma, what are you doing?

1:02:40.651 --> 1:02:43.688
Oh, just applauding
these fine performers.

1:02:43.754 --> 1:02:47.124
I guess that's the end of your
little show then, isn't it?

1:02:56.902 --> 1:02:58.502
Mrs. Wentworth?

1:02:58.569 --> 1:03:00.671
Is she trapped
back in time, too?

1:03:00.738 --> 1:03:04.910
No, Shaggy. She's not back in
time, and neither are we.

1:03:04.977 --> 1:03:06.677
But the photo on the phone.

1:03:06.744 --> 1:03:09.081
Forgot to charge it.
It just went dead.

1:03:09.146 --> 1:03:11.582
But all the magic.
The flying, the lights...

1:03:11.649 --> 1:03:13.885
Heck, when she did
that spell to freeze me.

1:03:13.952 --> 1:03:16.554
It's like I thought.
There was no magic.

1:03:16.621 --> 1:03:18.823
<i>It was all just
wires, sleep gas,</i>

1:03:18.890 --> 1:03:22.226
<i>and the light show that the mayor said
the town was going to show us later on.</i>

1:03:22.293 --> 1:03:24.295
As for the freezing,

1:03:24.362 --> 1:03:27.365
we all know you're kind of impressionable
when someone yells in your direction.

1:03:27.431 --> 1:03:29.868
- What? That's not...
- Jump!

1:03:30.836 --> 1:03:32.536
Okay. Good to know.

1:03:34.472 --> 1:03:37.976
So, the people,
they were what? Actors?

1:03:38.043 --> 1:03:39.610
Not just any actors.

1:03:39.677 --> 1:03:43.180
This in none other than that
wonderful British thespian,

1:03:43.247 --> 1:03:44.715
Winston Pilkingstonshire.

1:03:44.782 --> 1:03:47.119
Winston Pilkingstonshire?

1:03:47.184 --> 1:03:51.155
He's the actor who plays
Thundarr the Barbarian on TV.

1:03:51.222 --> 1:03:52.790
- Right?
- Right.

1:03:52.858 --> 1:03:55.660
I got even more suspicious
when Arthur said "demon dogs,"

1:03:55.726 --> 1:03:57.762
one of Thundarr's
catchphrases.

1:03:57.828 --> 1:04:01.632
You know, you say the same lines
for 30 years, they're hard to shake.

1:04:01.699 --> 1:04:04.002
But what really gave it away
were the abs.

1:04:04.069 --> 1:04:06.303
I'd know those abs anywhere.

1:04:06.370 --> 1:04:08.172
Whoa. Will you sign my tunic?

1:04:08.239 --> 1:04:12.410
Yes, it's me and my abs.

1:04:12.476 --> 1:04:17.248
But we couldn't have done it without this
marvelous medieval Renaissance troupe.

1:04:17.314 --> 1:04:20.418
Everyone, please,
take a bow.

1:04:22.054 --> 1:04:24.488
Velma, amazing deduction.

1:04:24.555 --> 1:04:26.590
It's true. I was hired to be
the inaugural actor

1:04:26.657 --> 1:04:31.429
to play King Arthur in Norville o'er
Morgania's newest tourist attraction,

1:04:31.495 --> 1:04:33.664
Camelot Reimagined.

1:04:35.299 --> 1:04:38.402
Camelot Reimagined?
What is that?

1:04:38.469 --> 1:04:40.438
It should be obvious, Daphne.

1:04:40.504 --> 1:04:43.207
<i>Do you remember when we first
arrived at Norville o'er Morgania?</i>

1:04:43.274 --> 1:04:47.344
<i>We reached that roundabout with the
one road blocked off for construction.</i>

1:04:47.411 --> 1:04:50.448
This must be some sort of
immersive attraction

1:04:50.514 --> 1:04:52.884
built right next to the town
to attract tourists.

1:04:52.951 --> 1:04:56.054
In fact, with the way that Camelot
is centered in this small valley

1:04:56.121 --> 1:04:58.957
to obscure what's on the other
side of that stand of trees

1:04:59.024 --> 1:05:02.493
and how the castle only has
windows facing one side,

1:05:02.560 --> 1:05:05.229
I'm willing to bet that
Norville o'er Morgania

1:05:05.296 --> 1:05:07.331
is actually only
a couple of miles away.

1:05:07.398 --> 1:05:12.403
She's right. And you five are
our first guests to take part

1:05:12.470 --> 1:05:16.141
in what we hope will be a very
lucrative entertainment experience.

1:05:16.208 --> 1:05:19.677
Yeah, but did they have to knock
us out to pretend it was real?

1:05:19.744 --> 1:05:21.980
Actually, they did, Shaggy.

1:05:22.047 --> 1:05:23.982
- All because of you.
- Me?

1:05:24.049 --> 1:05:26.484
Do you remember
the legend of Sir Norville?

1:05:26.550 --> 1:05:29.353
It said that if Norville
or any of his line returned,

1:05:29.420 --> 1:05:31.722
they would lay claim
to the land of Camelot.

1:05:31.789 --> 1:05:33.992
When the mayor
found out about your lineage

1:05:34.059 --> 1:05:36.627
<i>and saw your ancient medallion
with the inscription of Camelot,</i>

1:05:36.694 --> 1:05:39.730
<i>he was convinced you were
here to lay claim to the town.</i>

1:05:39.797 --> 1:05:42.000
<i>Precisely. After he met Shaggy,</i>

1:05:42.067 --> 1:05:44.702
<i>he organized a town meeting
and told everyone</i>

1:05:44.769 --> 1:05:46.838
<i>they would have to do
whatever it takes</i>

1:05:46.905 --> 1:05:49.707
<i>to get you to sign over the
deed for the land to the town.</i>

1:05:49.774 --> 1:05:52.144
Like, I don't wanna
own real estate.

1:05:52.210 --> 1:05:54.980
- You don't?
- Ma'am, no way.

1:05:55.046 --> 1:05:57.581
Do you know how many
creepy, evil people we've met

1:05:57.648 --> 1:06:00.018
that do weird things
just for a piece of land?

1:06:00.085 --> 1:06:04.256
No offense,
but I'd gladly sign over the deed.

1:06:04.321 --> 1:06:06.024
Just give me the paperwork.

1:06:06.091 --> 1:06:07.959
That's very sweet, Shaggy.

1:06:08.026 --> 1:06:12.030
Luckily, you've already
signed the deed... over to me!

1:06:14.065 --> 1:06:15.699
Ha-ha!

1:06:15.766 --> 1:06:19.670
Um, this is definitely not
part of the script.

1:06:19.737 --> 1:06:22.673
I know because I memorized the
entire thing, everyone's parts.

1:06:22.740 --> 1:06:24.742
I always do.
It's just a thing.

1:06:24.809 --> 1:06:28.646
These ignorant townspeople put everything
into this King Arthur experience,

1:06:28.712 --> 1:06:31.249
wanting to split the profits
between everyone.

1:06:31.315 --> 1:06:35.187
But you know what's better than splitting
profits with hundreds of people?

1:06:35.253 --> 1:06:37.388
Splitting them with no one!

1:06:37.454 --> 1:06:39.824
Once I send this to
the proper authorities,

1:06:39.891 --> 1:06:43.261
this town and the money
it makes will be mine!

1:06:45.396 --> 1:06:47.698
She's trying to get away.
Get her!

1:06:49.301 --> 1:06:50.568
Look out!

1:06:58.475 --> 1:07:00.411
And there goes my retirement.

1:07:00.477 --> 1:07:03.380
All she has to do is mail that
deed and the town is hers.

1:07:03.447 --> 1:07:04.782
We have to stop her.

1:07:04.850 --> 1:07:06.584
Where's the nearest mailbox?

1:07:06.650 --> 1:07:09.287
Uh, what's a mailbox, Sir Fred?

1:07:09.353 --> 1:07:11.256
We're not acting anymore,
you twit.

1:07:11.323 --> 1:07:13.724
Oh, right, mate.
Sorry, sorry.

1:07:13.791 --> 1:07:15.459
It's about two kilometers
that way

1:07:15.526 --> 1:07:17.628
in the center
of Norville o'er Morgania.

1:07:17.695 --> 1:07:21.498
But she's too far away.
There's no way we can catch up to her.

1:07:21.565 --> 1:07:23.134
No, there is a way.

1:07:30.474 --> 1:07:33.078
Ariel, Ookla, ride!

1:07:38.415 --> 1:07:39.851
Do you wanna?

1:07:39.918 --> 1:07:41.485
No. You be Ariel.

1:07:41.552 --> 1:07:43.721
I'm Ookla, naturally.

1:08:00.372 --> 1:08:03.474
Those fools. With this deed,
there's nothing to stop me

1:08:03.540 --> 1:08:06.777
from owning this town
once and for all.

1:08:06.845 --> 1:08:07.778
Huh?

1:08:13.351 --> 1:08:14.752
This is your idea?

1:08:14.818 --> 1:08:17.122
Don't worry, love.
It's just a converted lorry.

1:08:17.188 --> 1:08:18.789
A baby could drive it.

1:08:21.026 --> 1:08:23.494
See? What did
I tell you? Easy-peasy.

1:08:23.560 --> 1:08:26.430
Like,
this is amazing!

1:08:39.210 --> 1:08:41.313
She's getting away!

1:08:41.379 --> 1:08:42.446
Huh?

1:09:05.736 --> 1:09:07.571
We've gotta put her down.

1:09:07.638 --> 1:09:09.473
All right. Winston's got it.

1:09:20.684 --> 1:09:22.053
Hold on, everyone.

1:09:30.694 --> 1:09:33.664
Lords of Light, that was fun!

1:09:33.731 --> 1:09:36.034
- Oh, let's go again.
- Ariel rules!

1:09:36.101 --> 1:09:39.037
We made it.
We, like, survived.

1:09:42.974 --> 1:09:46.244
But you failed in your quest!

1:09:46.311 --> 1:09:51.249
Not yet we haven't,
vile sorceress.

1:09:54.119 --> 1:09:56.587
Fly true, my beauty!

1:09:59.924 --> 1:10:01.960
And for good measure...

1:10:09.034 --> 1:10:11.870
What? No fair!

1:10:11.936 --> 1:10:15.572
Oh, my.
What's going on here?

1:10:15.639 --> 1:10:19.576
Well, Mayor, we know about you and the
town trying to gaslight us into thinking

1:10:19.643 --> 1:10:21.046
we were trapped
in the Dark Ages

1:10:21.112 --> 1:10:23.381
in order to claim this land
as your own.

1:10:23.448 --> 1:10:26.151
But, then, you didn't think
your town librarian

1:10:26.217 --> 1:10:28.652
would try to steal
the deed for herself.

1:10:28.719 --> 1:10:30.554
I would've gotten
away with it, too,

1:10:30.621 --> 1:10:33.058
if it wasn't for you
meddling kids.

1:10:33.124 --> 1:10:34.825
And... And...

1:10:34.893 --> 1:10:37.694
A little bit of
Scooby Gang magic.

1:10:39.397 --> 1:10:43.301
Well, I'm assuming that you'll
want to lay claim to the land then.

1:10:43.368 --> 1:10:44.836
No way.

1:10:44.903 --> 1:10:47.872
This land belongs to you
and the rest of the town.

1:10:47.939 --> 1:10:50.275
I'm actually pretty proud
to know my ancestors

1:10:50.341 --> 1:10:53.311
came from such imaginative
and entrepreneurial people.

1:10:53.378 --> 1:10:55.779
Well, then there's only
one thing left to do.

1:10:55.847 --> 1:10:57.581
What's that, Mayor?

1:10:57.648 --> 1:10:59.284
Party!

1:11:03.922 --> 1:11:07.959
Not a bad way to spend our vacation.
Wouldn't you say so, Sir Fred?

1:11:08.026 --> 1:11:11.062
Not bad at all,
Sir Daphne.

1:11:11.129 --> 1:11:14.199
So, was any of it real,
Mr. Pilkingstonshire?

1:11:14.265 --> 1:11:17.135
Our budding bromance?
The sandwiches?

1:11:17.202 --> 1:11:19.104
- Any of it?
- I'm an actor, Shaggy,

1:11:19.170 --> 1:11:22.340
but there are some things
you just can't fake.

1:11:22.407 --> 1:11:25.676
One of those things
is a love of sandwiches.

1:11:25.742 --> 1:11:29.080
Watch the sandwich scene in <i>Citizen Kane.</i>
You'll see what I mean.

1:11:30.849 --> 1:11:32.984
Friendship is another one,
Shaggy.

1:11:33.051 --> 1:11:35.286
You kids aren't so bad,
for septics.

1:11:36.287 --> 1:11:38.857
Uh, septic tanks. Yanks.

1:11:38.923 --> 1:11:41.326
I've got a wonderful
beach house in the UK.

1:11:41.392 --> 1:11:42.927
You must come sometime.

1:11:42.994 --> 1:11:45.196
And stay in a hotel
nearby.

1:11:45.263 --> 1:11:47.298
- Cheese.
- Cheese.

1:11:47.365 --> 1:11:49.901
I'm still not sure
how you pulled it off.

1:11:49.968 --> 1:11:52.937
The blasts of cold air,
fireballs, flying...

1:11:53.004 --> 1:11:54.738
It all felt so real.

1:11:54.805 --> 1:11:57.041
Magic is real, Velma.

1:11:57.108 --> 1:12:01.179
You just have to look
deep within to find it.

1:12:01.246 --> 1:12:05.850
Okay, I get it. A magician never
tells how he did the trick.

1:12:05.917 --> 1:12:08.153
Now, young apprentice,
I gotta run.

1:12:08.219 --> 1:12:10.054
Remember the lessons
I've taught you, hmm?

1:12:10.121 --> 1:12:13.591
Once you suss out magic,
there's nothing you can't get up to.

1:12:13.657 --> 1:12:16.194
Sure. Thank you, "Merlin."

1:12:16.261 --> 1:12:18.029
It's been surreal.

1:12:19.663 --> 1:12:21.833
Tatty-bye.

1:12:21.900 --> 1:12:25.736
Where is your friend going?
He's going to miss the fireworks show.

1:12:25.802 --> 1:12:27.771
My friend?
You mean Merlin?

1:12:27.839 --> 1:12:29.706
Isn't he
one of the townspeople?

1:12:29.773 --> 1:12:32.310
No. Never seen him
before in my life.

1:12:32.377 --> 1:12:35.113
- We thought he was with you.
- He's not with me.

1:12:35.180 --> 1:12:37.681
And if he's not
with you, then...

1:12:38.483 --> 1:12:40.251
No. It can't be.

1:12:47.824 --> 1:12:50.028
Told you reality
was a simulation.

1:12:50.094 --> 1:12:54.866
Scooby-Dooby-Doo!
