00:01.152 --> 00:02.584
- VINNY: You gotta know when to
shut up.

00:02.720 --> 00:04.687
I don't wanna hear no more, man.
- Listen to this, man. I mean--

00:04.822 --> 00:06.288
- I don't wanna hear no more.
Stop following me!

00:06.424 --> 00:07.790
- I can do stand-up.
You just--let me tell you,

00:07.925 --> 00:09.491
let me tell you what I can--
look at this one.

00:09.627 --> 00:10.859
- Hey, hey, hey,
what's going on?

00:10.995 --> 00:12.728
- He thinks he's a comedian,
that's what.

00:12.863 --> 00:14.663
- Well, I can do anything
I put my mind to.

00:14.799 --> 00:16.765
- Except make people laugh.
You can't do that.

00:16.901 --> 00:19.501
- Okay, okay, listen to this.
This is about to be hilarious.

00:19.637 --> 00:22.738
Okay, what did one ocean
say to the other ocean?

00:22.873 --> 00:24.106
- I don't know.

00:24.241 --> 00:27.176
- They didn't say nothing.
They just waved.

00:27.311 --> 00:29.545
- I'm killing doc, I'm killing!

00:29.680 --> 00:31.814
- No, you need to be killed.
You need to be killed!

00:31.949 --> 00:33.449
- MR. BROWN: Okay, okay, Vinny
listen, listen.

00:33.584 --> 00:35.350
Watch this, watch this.
Vinny.

00:35.486 --> 00:37.486
You want to hear
a construction joke?

00:37.621 --> 00:41.290
I can't 'cause
I'm still working on it.

00:41.425 --> 00:42.925
- So stupid!

00:43.060 --> 00:45.761
- MR. BROWN: Hey, what'd you
get the medal for?

00:45.896 --> 00:47.129
- Okay, look.

00:47.264 --> 00:49.798
I won the 100 yard dash
at field day.

00:49.934 --> 00:51.734
You should've seen it.
I smoked them boys.

00:51.869 --> 00:54.403
I don't even know what happened.
It was like a blur.

00:54.538 --> 00:56.972
- It's called
being in your zone, man.

00:57.108 --> 00:59.108
See, you got that in your blood.

00:59.243 --> 01:01.810
I won field day
at the highest level

01:01.946 --> 01:05.781
at Denmark Technical School,
baby, HBCU.

01:05.916 --> 01:08.417
Denmark, South Carolina, man.
Sure did.

01:08.552 --> 01:11.754
- You ain't the only one
that know how to run fast.

01:11.889 --> 01:14.156
I won field day at my high
school at the middlest level.

01:14.291 --> 01:16.658
Yes, and I bet you didn't know
I was in the Olympics.

01:16.794 --> 01:18.293
- Really?
- MR. BROWN: Oh yeah.

01:18.429 --> 01:20.729
You know the Black man
that was on the thing with

01:20.865 --> 01:23.165
the head like that
and you couldn't see his face?

01:23.300 --> 01:24.533
That was me.

01:24.668 --> 01:26.435
- You was the black fist?

01:26.570 --> 01:28.137
- Yeah. That's me.

01:28.272 --> 01:30.172
- Brown, you ain't never beat
nobody in a foot race.

01:30.307 --> 01:32.274
Stop lying, man.
- I could beat you!

01:32.409 --> 01:33.942
- Okay, you know what?
I would beat you,

01:34.078 --> 01:36.678
but my mama told me
don't fight ugly people

01:36.814 --> 01:38.680
'cause they ain't
got nothing to lose.

01:38.816 --> 01:41.016
- Well, I bet your mama ain't
never had a fight either then.

01:41.152 --> 01:42.184
Don't talk about my mama, man.

01:42.319 --> 01:43.385
- Hey, hey, hey...

01:43.521 --> 01:45.454
break it up, guys!
- What?

01:45.589 --> 01:47.022
- There's only one way
to settle this.

01:47.158 --> 01:49.725
- Well, I know how to settle it.
- No, no, to decide

01:49.860 --> 01:51.593
who the supreme athlete is--
- Mh-mm?

01:51.729 --> 01:55.430
- We'll have a Mr. Brown
versus Grandpa Vinny field day.

01:55.566 --> 01:57.466
- Oh, I'mma bring it!
I can see it now.

01:57.601 --> 02:00.435
Leroy FL Brown.

02:00.571 --> 02:03.172
- The FL is for
Fast as Lightning.

02:03.307 --> 02:05.040
I'm about to smoke him
like a cigarette.

02:05.176 --> 02:07.509
Just--just like that.

02:07.645 --> 02:09.044
- And I'm about to
run the color out them

02:09.180 --> 02:10.913
ugly ass pants.

02:11.048 --> 02:12.881
- Did you see that?

02:13.017 --> 02:15.184
I just ran outside
and came back.

02:15.319 --> 02:16.518
Need me to slow it down?

02:16.654 --> 02:19.154
I'm back. Cold, cold

02:19.290 --> 02:22.925
- Just left your mama's house.
I'm back again, look at that.

02:23.060 --> 02:25.527
- This is gonna be good.

02:25.663 --> 02:26.995
- ♪

02:27.131 --> 02:29.631
- ♪ No matter what you do,
I love you ♪

02:29.767 --> 02:33.235

I'm behind you for sure ♪

02:33.370 --> 02:36.138

02:41.729 --> 02:43.328
- Ooh, Crawford has a good
Political Science department.

02:43.464 --> 02:48.300
- Mmm. Speaking of colleges.

02:48.435 --> 02:50.536
Have you narrowed down
your list yet?

02:50.671 --> 02:53.772
You know, maybe Bridgewell.

02:53.908 --> 02:56.441
I know they made it to
this year's top

02:56.577 --> 02:58.744
Ivy League schools.
- Okay, of course?

02:58.879 --> 03:01.213
It's been like the only thing
that's on my mind.

03:01.348 --> 03:03.849
Okay, so I've narrowed it down
to two schools.

03:03.984 --> 03:05.784
But I'm torn between the two.

03:05.920 --> 03:07.886
Okay, I mean, you know
I love Bridgewell, right?

03:08.022 --> 03:10.055
It's your alma mater
and it's a great school.

03:10.190 --> 03:12.558
But, there's one more
school that I love.

03:12.693 --> 03:14.793
- Ooh! Love it?
Love it?

03:14.929 --> 03:16.895
- Okay, look, look, look.
Crawford College,

03:17.031 --> 03:19.398
it is so perfect.

03:19.533 --> 03:21.166
Yeah, I like Crawford.
I mean, it's

03:21.302 --> 03:24.202
a good school, babe.
But, oh my gosh, Bridgewell is

03:24.338 --> 03:27.906
so much more diverse.
I mean, Black, white, Hispanic,

03:28.042 --> 03:31.743
Asian, Brazilian, Indian,
Africans, like, you gonna meet

03:31.879 --> 03:34.046
so many interesting people.
You gonna get to

03:34.181 --> 03:37.549
get that passport stamp,
you know what I'm saying?

03:37.685 --> 03:39.785
- Right, okay, look,
I've entered the summer programs

03:39.920 --> 03:42.554
for both of the schools, so.
We'll just have to wait

03:42.690 --> 03:44.556
and see what happens.
But I'll have to

03:44.692 --> 03:46.191
make a decision very soon.

03:46.327 --> 03:48.860
- You know, any school would be
lucky to have you.

03:48.996 --> 03:50.796
Right?
I'm so proud of you.

03:50.931 --> 03:52.564
- Thanks Mom
- [Leah clearing throat]

03:52.700 --> 03:54.232
- LEAH: But.

03:54.368 --> 03:56.602
I would be really proud
and excited if you decided

03:56.737 --> 03:59.004
to go to Bridgewell.

03:59.139 --> 04:01.406
- Okay, bye, Mom.

04:01.542 --> 04:04.209
- I mean, you know,
it's a good school.

04:04.345 --> 04:05.911
- Okay, bye, Mom.
- Right?

04:06.046 --> 04:08.480
We could be like twinsies! We
could get matching university

04:08.616 --> 04:09.781
shirts, girl!
- Okay, I don't know

04:09.917 --> 04:10.983
about twins.
- Yeah. Right?

04:11.118 --> 04:12.618
- We're not wearing
the same clothes.

04:12.753 --> 04:14.186
- I wonder if they'd let--
- We will never wear

04:14.321 --> 04:15.120
the same clothes.
- Never?

04:15.255 --> 04:16.521
- We will never wear

04:16.657 --> 04:18.123
the same clothes.
- Girl. Girl. When you get

04:18.258 --> 04:19.791
an alumni shirt, we're gonna
wear the same clothes, okay?

04:19.927 --> 04:21.426
I'm gonna come sit in one of
your classes.

04:21.562 --> 04:23.629
- Okay, goodbye, goodbye.
- I wonder if Professor Jackson

04:23.764 --> 04:25.097
is still--
- You know what? Mom--

04:25.232 --> 04:26.798
- I still think--
you don't want your clothes?

04:26.934 --> 04:29.067
Close your brother's drawer.
You're putting me out!

04:29.203 --> 04:31.770
I'm gonna come
and visit you at college,

04:31.905 --> 04:33.238
you know!

04:33.374 --> 04:34.940
I'm paying for it.

04:36.577 --> 04:37.709
- Hey.

04:37.845 --> 04:39.511
- Hey baby, what's wrong?

04:39.647 --> 04:42.280
- I'm having trouble deciding
which college I want to attend.

04:42.416 --> 04:45.250
I mean, I have two top choices,
but I love them both.

04:45.386 --> 04:47.886
- Girl, with your track record
and your grades, any school

04:48.022 --> 04:50.589
in the world would want you.
Which two schools?

04:50.724 --> 04:52.290
- Bridgewell and Crawford.

04:52.426 --> 04:56.128
- That's easy for me!
Crawford, it was my alma mater.

04:56.263 --> 05:00.699
Yes, we ranked number one
for several years, HBCU.

05:00.834 --> 05:02.567
There's no better school
than Crawford.

05:02.703 --> 05:04.603
- I know,
I love Crawford so much.

05:04.738 --> 05:06.104
But, I also love Bridgewell.

05:06.240 --> 05:08.974
- You know, there's no
comparison between an HBCU

05:09.109 --> 05:12.010
and a traditional college
like Bridgewell.

05:13.514 --> 05:15.914
- Beg to differ.

05:16.050 --> 05:18.450
- What makes an HBCU better
than a traditional college?

05:18.585 --> 05:21.086
- Have you ever been to a opera?
Or know what opera is?

05:21.221 --> 05:24.623
- Yeah, I know what an opera is.
- That will be Bridgewell, okay?

05:24.758 --> 05:26.692
And, uh, if you...
have you ever been to

05:26.827 --> 05:29.194
the Battle of the Bands?
- Mm-hmm.

05:29.329 --> 05:33.632
- That's a HBCU, baby.
We be breaking it down.

05:33.767 --> 05:35.434
- Are you going
to school to boogie

05:35.569 --> 05:37.035
or to get an education?

05:37.171 --> 05:40.138
- We going for both!
- REGINALD: Oh?

05:40.274 --> 05:42.140
At a traditional school
like Bridgewell,

05:42.276 --> 05:45.043
there's more resources.

05:45.179 --> 05:48.080
The more majors, more
internships,

05:48.215 --> 05:49.981
more opportunities.

05:50.117 --> 05:52.984
- CORA: That's why
I love my HBCU, baby.

05:53.120 --> 05:54.886
We built sisterhoods together

05:55.022 --> 05:57.322
that still stand strong
to this day.

05:57.458 --> 06:01.093
And we even fought injustices
and help build our community.

06:01.228 --> 06:04.096
We did everything we could to
make it better for y'all, baby.

06:04.231 --> 06:05.664
See what I'm saying?
Sandra, ain't nothing

06:05.799 --> 06:09.000
like the HBCU.
- Bridgewell, no comparison.

06:09.136 --> 06:11.770
Bridgewell is
a much finer institution.

06:11.905 --> 06:13.171
- It's all right.
But you know what?

06:13.307 --> 06:15.707
I'm going to Bible study.
I'll talk to you later.

06:15.843 --> 06:16.908
You have a good evening,
Mr. Reginald.

06:17.044 --> 06:19.111
- Yeah, yeah, Bridgewell.

06:19.246 --> 06:23.115
- Oh, hey, hey y'all.
I see y'all, what's up?

06:23.250 --> 06:26.151
- Hey, Philip.
What college are you going to?

06:26.286 --> 06:28.687
- Bridgewell.

06:28.822 --> 06:30.388
- Because mom and dad went
there?

06:30.524 --> 06:35.227
- No, 'cause Charlotte's going.
And wherever she goes, I go.

06:35.362 --> 06:38.296
- Okay, you know what?
I am done talking to you.

06:38.432 --> 06:41.366
Oh, Miss Anastasia!
What college did you go to?

06:41.502 --> 06:43.935
- Oh! Sit down.

06:44.071 --> 06:48.106
I went to the Griffin
University,

06:48.242 --> 06:51.877
the foremost HBCU in the
country.

06:52.012 --> 06:55.881
It took me from my small town
into the big city of DC.

06:56.016 --> 06:59.918
And I had the time of my life.

07:00.053 --> 07:03.321
We worked hard together,
we cried together,

07:03.457 --> 07:07.726
and we partied
like there was no tomorrow!

07:07.861 --> 07:09.127
- Everyone wants me
to go to the college

07:09.263 --> 07:10.929
that they like the best,
but no one's even

07:11.064 --> 07:13.732
asked me how I feel.
- Well.

07:13.867 --> 07:16.802
How you feel sweetheart?

07:16.937 --> 07:18.770
- I really don't know.

07:24.211 --> 07:26.845
- [blows whistle]
- Ooh, wow.

07:26.980 --> 07:28.747
- That's loud!
- Oh, we old. We old now.

07:28.882 --> 07:30.148
- All right, all right.
- Come on now.

07:30.284 --> 07:31.683
- How everybody feeling?
- Yeah, I'm feeling good!

07:31.819 --> 07:32.851
- PHILIP: Y'all feeling good?

07:32.986 --> 07:34.786
How's the knees?
How's the knees?

07:34.922 --> 07:37.022
All right, this is
event number one

07:37.157 --> 07:40.125
in the Mr. Brown versus
Grandpa Vinny field day.

07:40.260 --> 07:41.359
- Okay!

07:41.495 --> 07:43.628
- PHILIP: So we gonna
start off with a nice...

07:43.764 --> 07:45.297
Okay. I see you.

07:45.432 --> 07:47.866
We're gonna start off
with a nice strong sack race.

07:48.001 --> 07:49.935
- Gotcha.
- But we're gonna keep it clean.

07:50.070 --> 07:52.704
No running, no touching.
- Gotcha.

07:52.840 --> 07:55.807
- [farts]
- And no farting, Grandpa Vinny!

07:55.943 --> 07:58.376
- If I fart before the race,
does that count?

07:58.512 --> 08:00.045
- Yes, just don't fart at all.

08:00.180 --> 08:01.413
- Okay. All right, all right.

08:01.548 --> 08:03.348
- PHILIP: Alright,
so the first one down

08:03.483 --> 08:04.549
and back to me wins.

08:04.685 --> 08:06.518
Hop only.

08:06.653 --> 08:08.920
- Hey, I'mma show you how
I did it at field day

08:09.056 --> 08:11.356
at my high school.
I'm in the hall of fame.

08:11.491 --> 08:13.592
- For what?
- For the pole vault.

08:13.727 --> 08:14.960
- It had to be
one strong-ass pole.

08:15.095 --> 08:16.461
- PHILIP: All right,
all right, all right,

08:16.597 --> 08:17.729
enough of the chit-chat.

08:17.865 --> 08:19.331
Feeding bags, we good?
Okay.

08:19.466 --> 08:20.832
- I'm a good sportsman.
- VINNY: Yeah.

08:20.968 --> 08:21.900
- Good luck.

08:22.035 --> 08:23.735
I hope you get second.

08:23.871 --> 08:25.537
- I got this in the bag,
shut up.

08:25.672 --> 08:27.005
- Now we're ready.

08:27.140 --> 08:28.673
- Hey!
Any last words?

08:28.809 --> 08:33.545
- Uh, yeah, you look like
a cross between Richard Simmons

08:33.680 --> 08:35.580
and Bruce Bruce.
- PHILIP: Hey, hey, hey!

08:35.716 --> 08:37.482
- [blows whistle]

08:37.618 --> 08:39.050
- On your marks!
- Uh-huh.

08:39.186 --> 08:41.019
- Get set!
- Uh-huh.

08:42.756 --> 08:43.855
- [blows whistle]

08:43.991 --> 08:48.493
- [grunting]

08:50.597 --> 08:52.030
- [blows whistle]

08:52.165 --> 08:53.765
- We told you about that!
Stop with that, wachu doin' man?

08:53.901 --> 08:55.100
- All right,
all right, all right.

08:55.235 --> 08:57.035
Event number two.
- VINNY: Okay.

08:57.170 --> 08:59.237
- Toilet paper challenge.

08:59.373 --> 09:01.706
- This ought to be
right up your alley, Brown.

09:01.842 --> 09:03.541
- I'm about to
wipe you with this.

09:03.677 --> 09:05.944
- Anyways.

09:06.079 --> 09:07.412
Alright,
so what you're going to do.

09:07.547 --> 09:08.847
Grab the toilet paper,
put it on your head,

09:08.982 --> 09:09.848
and do a squat.

09:09.983 --> 09:12.183
Like this.
- Uh-huh.

09:13.654 --> 09:16.054
- Oh, that boy's talented.
- He's good, look at it, man.

09:16.189 --> 09:17.055
- You talented,
you must got some

09:17.190 --> 09:18.223
African in you or something.

09:18.358 --> 09:20.058
- Yeah, he does,
just a little bit.

09:20.193 --> 09:22.627
- All right. So you're going put
the toilet paper on your head,

09:22.763 --> 09:23.762
do a squat down and rise.

09:23.897 --> 09:24.963
- Okay.
- That's one set.

09:25.098 --> 09:26.665
- Okay.
- First person to 10 wins.

09:26.800 --> 09:27.999
- Wow!
- Got it! I got it!

09:28.135 --> 09:29.901
- We can do that.
- I got this!

09:30.037 --> 09:31.202
- It ain't no problem.

09:31.338 --> 09:32.570
- Alright. On your marks.
- Here we go.

09:32.706 --> 09:33.705
- Get set.
- Spread them out,

09:33.840 --> 09:35.473
spread them out!
- [blows whistle]

09:35.609 --> 09:37.809
- We got to go low!
- That's as low as I can go!

09:37.945 --> 09:39.377
- All right.
- I can't go no lower!

09:39.513 --> 09:40.845
- Come, come back up!
- I'm locked!

09:40.981 --> 09:42.314
- Come back...
- I'm locked there!

09:42.449 --> 09:44.416
- PHILIP: Are you twerking
or shaking, Mr. Brown?

09:44.551 --> 09:45.784
Get up!
- Oh, god!

09:45.919 --> 09:47.719
- Help me!

09:47.854 --> 09:49.254
- My hip went out!

09:49.389 --> 09:50.221
- I gotcha!

09:52.426 --> 09:55.994
Okay. Okay.

09:56.129 --> 09:57.562
Well, that didn't work.

09:57.698 --> 10:01.199
- Look at my leg shaking,
look at my leg shaking.

10:01.335 --> 10:03.034
- My gosh.
Stop, stop, stop!

10:03.170 --> 10:08.173
Alright since neither of you
completed event one or two,

10:08.308 --> 10:10.475
the winner of event three
is going to be our winner.

10:10.610 --> 10:12.310
- Well, what's event three?

10:12.446 --> 10:16.448
- One event, three words.
One chip challenge.

10:16.583 --> 10:17.949
- One chip challenge?

10:18.085 --> 10:20.251
- All it's gonna be is just one
chip? Come on now.

10:20.387 --> 10:22.354
- Both of you guys
gonna eat one spicy chip

10:22.489 --> 10:25.056
and whoever reaches for
the safety glass of milk first

10:25.192 --> 10:27.726
is the loser.
- Oh, I got this one.

10:27.861 --> 10:30.028
I been eating chips a long time.

10:30.163 --> 10:32.130
Bring the chips out!

10:32.265 --> 10:33.665
- All righty. Thank you.

10:33.800 --> 10:34.899
- Thank you.
- All righty.

10:35.035 --> 10:36.368
- [squealing]

10:36.503 --> 10:38.770
- Oh my goodness.
Is that the acceptance letter

10:38.905 --> 10:40.438
for the summer program
at Bridgewell?

10:40.574 --> 10:42.207
- They're summer program letters
from both Bridgewell

10:42.342 --> 10:44.175
and Crawford.
They've come at the same time.

10:44.311 --> 10:45.977
- Oh my goodness.
- Good luck!

10:46.113 --> 10:47.579
Okay, you have to understand

10:47.714 --> 10:49.614
if I get accepted into
one of the summer programs,

10:49.750 --> 10:51.549
it's about a 90 percent chance
that I'll get accepted

10:51.685 --> 10:53.685
into the university next year.
- Well, come on, honey!

10:53.820 --> 10:56.588
Let's roll with it!

10:56.723 --> 10:57.922
- REGINALD: Good luck.

10:58.058 --> 10:59.157
- Come on, baby!

10:59.292 --> 11:01.459
What does it say?
What does it say?

11:06.833 --> 11:08.933
- The suspense is killing me.

11:09.069 --> 11:11.002
- You?

11:14.641 --> 11:17.609
- I guess she didn't get
into either one.

11:22.682 --> 11:23.848
- No, no, no, no, no.

11:23.984 --> 11:27.685
She got accepted
into one of these.

11:27.821 --> 11:31.489
Okay, she got accepted into
the summer program at Crawford.

11:31.625 --> 11:33.658
- Oh, now I came home
at the right time!

11:33.794 --> 11:36.528
Now that's some great news!

11:36.663 --> 11:39.264
- Yes, yes, yes, yes!
She got accepted into

11:39.399 --> 11:43.201
the summer program
at Bridgewell, yes!

11:43.336 --> 11:45.036
- That's okay, that's okay.

11:45.172 --> 11:47.372
But we know it's Crawford.
Crawford it is.

11:47.507 --> 11:48.840
- Says who?

11:48.975 --> 11:51.342
- Says America.
She needs to go to school

11:51.478 --> 11:54.145
with her people so she can
learn more about her culture

11:54.281 --> 11:55.947
- America?
- Yes!

11:56.083 --> 11:58.283
- She needs to get
the best education.

11:58.418 --> 12:01.019
She needs to be somewhere
with top-of-the-line technology

12:01.154 --> 12:02.954
so she can push forward.

12:03.090 --> 12:05.256
- A larger institution
will allow Sandra

12:05.392 --> 12:08.760
to spread her wings
and explore all majors.

12:08.895 --> 12:10.428
- Say that, Mr. Reginald.

12:10.564 --> 12:12.597
- It's an easy choice
if you ask me.

12:12.732 --> 12:15.433
- First of all, ain't nobody
asked you, Mr. Reginald.

12:15.569 --> 12:17.335
- You can say anything you want.
We want her to get

12:17.471 --> 12:19.771
the best education for her.

12:19.906 --> 12:20.972
- Absolutely.
- Okay?

12:21.108 --> 12:24.109
- Yeah, that would be Crawford.

12:24.244 --> 12:26.377
Wait a minute,
where you going?

12:27.781 --> 12:30.081
- We'll support you in whatever
decision you make, babe.

12:30.217 --> 12:32.117
- I know you want me to go
to Bridgewell, Mom.

12:32.252 --> 12:34.252
- LEAH: Your dad and I

12:34.387 --> 12:36.521
will support whatever
choice you make.

12:36.656 --> 12:40.191
Even if that means you
go to that other school.

12:40.327 --> 12:42.627
- Oh, you mean Crawford College?

12:42.762 --> 12:46.331
One of the best schools
for Black women in the country?

12:46.466 --> 12:49.767
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Yeah, that other place.

12:49.903 --> 12:55.240
- You, you have not one
but two colleges that want you.

12:55.375 --> 12:57.709
You're blessed.
You even...

12:57.844 --> 12:59.344
you're better than blessed.

12:59.479 --> 13:03.481
- LEAH: Baby, she's right.
She's, she's right.

13:03.617 --> 13:07.485
I just got caught up.
I got caught up in wanting you

13:07.621 --> 13:09.854
to, to you know, go to
the same place I went.

13:09.990 --> 13:11.623
Like, do all
the same things I did,

13:11.758 --> 13:13.558
go to the same places
I went to when I was...

13:13.693 --> 13:15.126
- Homecoming Café,
- LEAH: Yes!

13:15.262 --> 13:17.529
- Q-Time, Annie Laura's Kitchen.
Yes, I know, Mom.

13:17.664 --> 13:19.197
- Boring.

13:19.332 --> 13:21.966
- Now, I told you about
cutting me off earlier today.

13:22.102 --> 13:23.201
Remember that?

13:23.336 --> 13:24.969
- Sorry.
- LEAH: Mm-hmm.

13:25.105 --> 13:30.542
But your dear mother would, um,
forgive you and let that slide

13:30.677 --> 13:33.645
if you decide to go to
Bridgewell.

13:33.780 --> 13:35.613
- So, it's time you put on
your big girl boots

13:35.749 --> 13:37.982
and it's all on you.

13:38.118 --> 13:39.551
Crawford College!

13:39.686 --> 13:41.119
- Bridgewell!

13:41.254 --> 13:42.086
- Crawford College!

13:42.222 --> 13:46.324
- Bridgewell!

13:46.459 --> 13:48.059
- CORA: Crawford College!
Oh yeah!

13:48.195 --> 13:50.995
- Bridgewell!

13:51.131 --> 13:53.264
- Ooh, mama jokes, okay!
Your mama,

13:53.400 --> 13:54.899
your mama's so dumb!

13:55.035 --> 13:56.301
- How dumb is she?

13:56.436 --> 13:59.170
- She saw a sign that said,
"Disneyland left"

13:59.306 --> 14:01.406
and she went home.

14:01.541 --> 14:06.010
- Oh really? Oh really?
His mama's so stupid.

14:06.146 --> 14:08.046
- How stupid is she?

14:08.181 --> 14:09.414
- She took a ruler to bed

14:09.549 --> 14:11.482
to see how long
she was sleeping!

14:11.618 --> 14:12.884
I'm killing you!

14:13.019 --> 14:14.452
Killing it!

14:14.588 --> 14:17.422
- Ooh, ooh, ooh!
Your mama's so old.

14:17.557 --> 14:19.157
- How old is she?

14:19.292 --> 14:20.992
- I hit her in the back
and her boobs fell off.

14:21.127 --> 14:22.594
One, two.

14:22.729 --> 14:24.829
- Nah, nah, nuh-uh!
Nuh-uh! Listen!

14:24.965 --> 14:26.598
His mama's so big.

14:26.733 --> 14:28.566
- How big is she?

14:28.702 --> 14:31.336
- She had to go to the car wash
to take a shower!

14:31.471 --> 14:33.404
I'm killing you!
You're dead!

14:33.540 --> 14:35.039
- Let's put a stop to this,
something your mama

14:35.175 --> 14:36.774
don't ever say, anyway.

14:36.910 --> 14:39.244
We gonna check what a man I am.

14:39.379 --> 14:41.179
- All right, all right.
- What's in the bag?

14:41.314 --> 14:43.481
- Oh, oh you'll see.

14:43.617 --> 14:46.150
All right, so,
the rules are as follows.

14:46.286 --> 14:47.485
Okay, it's very simple.

14:47.621 --> 14:49.721
Both of you guys eat
the entire chip

14:49.856 --> 14:51.990
and whoever reaches
for their glass of milk first

14:52.125 --> 14:53.925
to stop the burning sensation
loses.

14:54.060 --> 14:55.059
Understood?

14:55.195 --> 14:56.728
- You know, when I was a baby.

14:56.863 --> 15:01.232
I had Mexican jalapeños
in my breast milk.

15:01.368 --> 15:02.700
You know what?

15:02.836 --> 15:05.169
My mama used to make
red pepper collard greens

15:05.305 --> 15:08.039
that'll burn your tongue
completely off.

15:08.174 --> 15:10.341
And I put hot sauce in mine.

15:10.477 --> 15:11.643
- Ooh.

15:11.778 --> 15:14.345
- Look, you have to
wear a glove to transfer

15:14.481 --> 15:17.148
the chip to your mouth.
It's so spicy

15:17.284 --> 15:20.285
that it can burn your skin.

15:20.420 --> 15:21.886
- Ain't got to wear no glove.

15:22.022 --> 15:24.489
- If you touch your eye,
if you touch your eye!

15:24.624 --> 15:25.857
We're gonna have to
go to the hospital.

15:25.992 --> 15:28.660
- Mr. Vinny, uh, Mr. Brown,
put the glove on.

15:28.795 --> 15:30.528
- All right,
I'll put the gloves on.

15:30.664 --> 15:33.931
- Ain't no chip with no glove.
- Chip for a glove.

15:34.067 --> 15:35.500
- Just one chip,
how bad can it be?

15:35.635 --> 15:37.001
- This is some stupid stuff.

15:37.137 --> 15:39.737
- All right.
On your mark.

15:39.873 --> 15:41.572
Get set.
- Okay.

15:43.977 --> 15:45.109
- [blows whistle]

15:46.780 --> 15:49.981
- PHILIP: The entire chip.
The entire chip.

15:50.116 --> 15:51.382
- MR: BROWN: Read 'em and weep.

15:51.518 --> 15:54.285
- [cheers and applause]

15:54.421 --> 15:56.020
- Any second now.
- SANDRA: You can do it Grandpa!

15:56.156 --> 15:57.822
Grandpa, you can do this!

15:57.957 --> 15:59.290
- Any second now!

15:59.426 --> 16:01.292
Any second.

16:01.428 --> 16:02.627
- PHILIP: There, there it goes.

16:04.931 --> 16:06.264
- Woo-hoo!

16:08.601 --> 16:10.001
- JEREMY: Drink the milk!

16:10.136 --> 16:12.704
- LEAH: Tap out, tap out!

16:12.839 --> 16:15.206
- Drink the milk!
Drink the milk!

16:15.342 --> 16:19.310
- [shouting, screaming]

16:26.753 --> 16:28.486
[cheering]

16:28.621 --> 16:34.392
- We got a winner!
Winner!

16:34.527 --> 16:36.794
- I got to use it!

16:42.168 --> 16:44.235
- Oh my god!

16:46.339 --> 16:47.705
- Okay.
- Yes!

16:47.841 --> 16:49.741
- We would love
to welcome you to our program

16:49.876 --> 16:51.342
this summer for you
to learn more about our school

16:51.478 --> 16:52.477
and spend time
with us on campus.

16:52.612 --> 16:54.946
- Still deciding?
- Oh, well I--

16:55.081 --> 16:56.080
- Crawford it is!
- Well, I--

16:56.216 --> 16:57.582
- Let her down easy, baby.

16:57.717 --> 17:00.985
- Okay, I still don't know!

17:01.121 --> 17:03.087
- Girl, you know you want
to pick one of them schools

17:03.223 --> 17:05.356
you want to go to or not,
quit playing.

17:05.492 --> 17:06.858
- She wants to go somewhere
where she can get

17:06.993 --> 17:09.127
the best education
and experience that's gonna

17:09.262 --> 17:10.795
prepare her for
the corporate world.

17:10.930 --> 17:13.765
- Exactly.
Then it's Crawford it is, baby.

17:13.900 --> 17:17.301
- Okay, she is going
to go wherever she feels

17:17.437 --> 17:22.440
is best for her,
her mother's alma mater.

17:22.575 --> 17:24.575
- CORA: You know what?
We shouldn't be putting

17:24.711 --> 17:26.344
all this pressure
on you like this, Sandra.

17:26.479 --> 17:27.945
- No, you should not
be putting all this pressure

17:28.081 --> 17:29.313
on my daughter like that!

17:29.449 --> 17:31.516
- No, we shouldn't!

17:31.651 --> 17:34.118
Okay, okay.
I'm sorry, baby.

17:34.254 --> 17:36.721
Whatever you decide,
I'm with you.

17:36.856 --> 17:39.357
- Thank you, Cora.
- You're welcome.

17:42.295 --> 17:44.796
Aren't we?

17:44.931 --> 17:46.464
- Yes.

17:48.401 --> 17:50.835
- [knocking at door]
- Ugh! My god!

17:50.970 --> 17:53.604
- Grandpa Vinny.
[laughs]

17:53.740 --> 17:57.575
- I know you want me to go
to an HBCU, Grandpa Vinny.

17:57.710 --> 18:01.879
- That chip burned a hole
in Grandpa Vinny's esophagus.

18:02.015 --> 18:05.516
I don't think I can even
speak right now, girl.

you going to.

18:26.873 --> 18:28.506
Put them out of their misery.

- You just told me.
Let's get everybody in here.
