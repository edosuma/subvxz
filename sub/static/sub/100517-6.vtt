WEBVTT

02:02.914 --> 02:04.415
Target 62 meters.

02:05.083 --> 02:07.377
Target acquired. Sending coordinates.

02:19.347 --> 02:22.600
-I'm going in.
- Negative. Wait for backup.

02:22.684 --> 02:25.019
I'm switching to ONI. I still have eyes.

02:25.103 --> 02:26.855
Stay where you are, soldier.

02:27.480 --> 02:29.190
No. We won't break her in virtual.

02:29.274 --> 02:31.693
If we want the weapon,
we need to take it in the real.

02:31.776 --> 02:33.528
Not with Harlan breathing down my neck.

02:33.611 --> 02:35.530
<i>-The mission parameters--</i>
-Are wrong.

02:35.613 --> 02:38.825
Falconer has to give it up willingly.
I can get close to her.

02:39.951 --> 02:41.870
That was his mistake.

02:42.495 --> 02:44.622
And you put me in this sleeve
for a reason.

02:45.707 --> 02:47.000
I'm going to use it.

02:52.672 --> 02:53.590
Tak!

03:00.763 --> 03:01.806
I've been waiting for you.

03:02.432 --> 03:04.642
-Where have you been?
-That's close enough.

03:05.143 --> 03:06.311
Quell, it's me.

03:07.812 --> 03:11.191
I looked everywhere. And I knew
if you could, this is where you'd return.

03:13.359 --> 03:16.529
My memories, they were lost.

03:17.697 --> 03:19.616
He brought me here to remember.

03:20.575 --> 03:21.409
Who did?

03:21.868 --> 03:23.161
Takeshi Kovacs.

03:25.496 --> 03:27.040
<i>He wears a new face now.</i>

03:28.333 --> 03:30.084
That man is an impostor.

03:31.419 --> 03:32.795
I'm Takeshi Kovacs.

03:33.588 --> 03:35.757
You know it in your bones,
you can feel it.

03:36.382 --> 03:38.259
You knew it before you turned around.

03:38.760 --> 03:40.553
Rip her stack, do you hear me?

03:42.847 --> 03:45.475
Look at me, Quell. What do you see?

03:58.529 --> 03:59.489
It's you.

04:05.828 --> 04:08.998
The Wedge has you surrounded.
Finish this now or they will.

04:14.504 --> 04:15.463
We can't stay here.

04:17.215 --> 04:18.549
Move, asshole.

04:18.633 --> 04:21.594
The one who brought me here,
he must have been after the weapon.

04:22.011 --> 04:23.263
<i>What weapon?</i>

04:23.513 --> 04:25.181
-Hold your fire.
-But, sir.

04:25.265 --> 04:26.891
<i>Stand down, that's an order.</i>

04:27.725 --> 04:28.810
<i>There's a cache.</i>

04:29.394 --> 04:32.230
<i>What I have hidden there</i>
<i>could restore our humanity.</i>

04:33.523 --> 04:35.775
<i>Bring the Harlans and the Protectorate</i>
<i>to their knees.</i>

04:38.111 --> 04:39.445
Ask her to take you there.

04:39.988 --> 04:41.114
Show me.

04:41.197 --> 04:45.368
It's too dangerous.
The other you, he's still out there.

04:46.160 --> 04:47.453
We could lead him to it.

04:47.537 --> 04:48.663
He's not a problem anymore.

04:48.746 --> 04:50.331
-You don't know that.
-I took care of it.

04:50.748 --> 04:52.041
He'll never hurt you again.

04:53.710 --> 04:56.129
<i>Take the lead,</i>
<i>but remember she's dangerous.</i>

04:56.212 --> 04:58.339
I give the command, you end her. Copy?

04:58.423 --> 04:59.299
I understand.

05:01.634 --> 05:02.635
I understand.

05:04.470 --> 05:07.932
This is hard to have been manipulated,

05:08.016 --> 05:09.684
but he may have had backup.

05:12.603 --> 05:15.606
We should secure the cache
before anyone else comes looking.

05:19.235 --> 05:21.112
Target moving. Maintain cover.

05:32.415 --> 05:33.458
Quell?

05:36.294 --> 05:37.628
Oh, shit!

05:38.671 --> 05:39.714
Quell?

05:52.894 --> 05:55.021
Come on, Kovacs, pick up.

06:24.967 --> 06:26.844
What the fuck?

06:41.692 --> 06:43.277
What is this place?

06:45.113 --> 06:46.697
I woke up here after the explosion.

06:47.156 --> 06:48.574
<i>Is this where you hid the weapon?</i>

06:49.117 --> 06:50.326
<i>It's where she hid me.</i>

06:50.952 --> 06:51.911
<i>She?</i>

06:53.287 --> 06:54.288
Reileen.

06:55.873 --> 07:01.003
Before she killed me, she copied my DHF,
saved my DNA and force grew a clone.

07:01.838 --> 07:04.257
-Why would she do that?
-I can show you.

07:08.803 --> 07:11.389
She's using your sister
to get under your skin.

07:12.974 --> 07:14.517
My memory's still coming back.

07:15.435 --> 07:17.854
But this chamber
is equipped with holo surveillance.

07:22.233 --> 07:23.693
-Rei.
-<i> Steady, son.</i>

07:23.776 --> 07:25.987
You can't trust anything she shows you.

07:31.409 --> 07:32.243
Tak?

07:34.787 --> 07:36.330
Tak's not coming.

07:37.081 --> 07:38.040
He's dead.

07:38.749 --> 07:39.584
They all are.

07:40.251 --> 07:41.085
No!

07:41.461 --> 07:42.920
<i>Stronghold is ash.</i>

07:43.004 --> 07:46.048
<i>There's no more Uprising.</i>
<i>The Protectorate crushed it.</i>

07:46.716 --> 07:48.009
<i>We're all that's left.</i>

07:48.593 --> 07:50.178
-This is your fault.
- No.

07:50.261 --> 07:52.388
It was supposed to be him on that shuttle.

07:52.472 --> 07:55.183
His DHF getting backed up, not yours.

07:55.683 --> 07:56.851
You gave us up.

07:57.351 --> 08:00.146
I wasn't going to let him die
for your bullshit cause.

08:00.229 --> 08:03.941
- Tak made his own choice!
- And I've made mine.

08:07.361 --> 08:12.867
I'm going to live long enough to see
every one of your nightmares come to pass.

08:13.409 --> 08:15.203
This is your tomb, Quell.

08:15.828 --> 08:17.580
Only you'll wish you were dead.

08:19.290 --> 08:20.708
No, Rei!

08:22.585 --> 08:23.419
No!

08:24.045 --> 08:26.088
No! Let me out!

08:26.255 --> 08:27.757
Let me out!

08:30.468 --> 08:32.386
She left me there trapped.

08:34.013 --> 08:35.598
You were awake the whole time?

08:36.390 --> 08:37.558
Only my mind was awake.

08:37.642 --> 08:39.435
<i>This is the great Quellcrist Falconer,</i>

08:40.144 --> 08:42.813
playing on pity like we didn't burn that
out of you.

08:52.114 --> 08:53.991
I never knew which was worse,

08:54.492 --> 08:56.202
losing myself in the dark

08:57.119 --> 08:58.871
or the pain that came with the light.

09:07.964 --> 09:08.965
Miss me?

09:10.174 --> 09:13.135
What you're feeling is your sleeve
warming back up.

09:14.053 --> 09:17.139
Anything becomes a stress position
if you hold it long enough.

09:17.223 --> 09:19.725
You've been holding this one
for almost a century.

09:19.809 --> 09:21.561
What do you want, Rei?

09:22.144 --> 09:23.271
Answers.

09:23.771 --> 09:25.856
I've gone over it again and again,

09:26.524 --> 09:28.025
trying to figure out when.

09:28.442 --> 09:29.277
When what?

09:29.360 --> 09:31.571
When I lost him, why he left.

09:32.071 --> 09:34.615
Tak didn't leave you.
You betrayed him.

09:34.699 --> 09:35.575
No.

09:36.325 --> 09:37.618
We were family.

09:38.035 --> 09:40.621
<i>The moment we found each other,</i>
<i>he turned on his unit.</i>

09:41.539 --> 09:45.042
I was more important than anything
until you.

09:46.419 --> 09:49.213
What makes you so goddamn special?

09:49.922 --> 09:51.757
It must be torture

09:52.508 --> 09:55.678
to have lived so long
and understand so little.

09:55.761 --> 09:58.598
You don't need to school me
in torture. I've made it my business.

09:58.681 --> 10:00.224
Pleasure, pain...

10:00.975 --> 10:02.727
people will pay anything for it.

10:04.061 --> 10:04.979
But you...

10:06.397 --> 10:07.732
You can have it for free.

10:07.815 --> 10:10.067
Whatever appetite
Reileen harbored for cruelty,

10:10.776 --> 10:12.320
immortality made it worse.

10:12.403 --> 10:15.948
<i>Your sister did her duty</i>
<i>to the Protectorate.</i>

10:16.532 --> 10:18.409
<i>-</i>Like me, like you.
- Excuse me, sir?

10:18.492 --> 10:20.870
-What?
-The Governor's been trying to reach you.

10:20.953 --> 10:22.997
I don't have the time
to stroke that bitch's ego.

10:23.080 --> 10:25.374
-She's here, sir.
-You owe me an update, Carrera.

10:26.917 --> 10:28.044
Or did you forget?

10:28.544 --> 10:29.795
You report to me now.

10:31.005 --> 10:32.256
I gave you an update.

10:32.340 --> 10:34.175
The Last Envoy is dead.

10:34.258 --> 10:35.801
We have Falconer surrounded.

10:35.885 --> 10:37.219
Where?

10:37.678 --> 10:39.513
-I don't see her.
- She's underground.

10:39.597 --> 10:42.516
We're waiting for her to resurface.
All exits are covered.

10:42.600 --> 10:46.604
My directive was clear:
shoot her on site and bring me her stack.

10:46.896 --> 10:50.775
Let me work. When we take Falconer,
you'll be the first to know.

10:51.317 --> 10:52.777
That I can guarantee.

10:57.573 --> 10:59.617
This bitch is not going anywhere.

11:00.451 --> 11:02.036
Back to work, soldier.

11:10.961 --> 11:13.255
- This is the last time I saw her.

11:17.051 --> 11:19.804
-You look tired, Rei.
- You look like hell.

11:19.887 --> 11:22.390
Maybe it's time to put you
out of your misery.

11:22.473 --> 11:24.058
You won't kill me.

11:24.892 --> 11:26.060
You're lonely.

11:27.436 --> 11:29.939
I'm the only thing you have left
that's real.

11:30.398 --> 11:31.774
You know what's real?

11:32.858 --> 11:33.818
Tak.

11:36.779 --> 11:37.822
He's alive?

11:38.698 --> 11:40.324
On ice doing time,

11:40.950 --> 11:42.243
but I have a way to get him out.

11:42.326 --> 11:43.994
Thought you'd want to know.

11:45.579 --> 11:49.458
Can't have you getting in the way again.
I'm spinning you down for good.

11:51.711 --> 11:53.921
These roots will grow up around you.

11:54.422 --> 11:56.424
You're hiding me in the first place
they'll look.

11:56.799 --> 11:58.342
You taught us well.

11:59.051 --> 12:01.679
Tak thinks he knows every inch
of this place.

12:02.763 --> 12:04.432
He'll walk right over you...

12:05.558 --> 12:07.226
and then he'll just keep on walking.

12:09.145 --> 12:11.397
He'll never stop searching.

12:11.480 --> 12:13.065
That's his cross to bear.

12:15.109 --> 12:16.193
Goodbye, Quell.

12:18.779 --> 12:19.613
Rei!

12:20.197 --> 12:21.031
No!

12:21.657 --> 12:24.243
- I was the one being buried...

12:26.036 --> 12:28.748
but it felt like she was on her way
to her own funeral.

12:31.542 --> 12:33.085
You said you'd show me the weapon.

12:34.378 --> 12:36.088
Instead you've shown me this. Why?

12:37.131 --> 12:38.507
You ask where I've been.

12:39.341 --> 12:40.426
Come.

12:40.843 --> 12:42.011
The weapon is nearby.

12:48.058 --> 12:51.061
<i>Don't move.</i>
<i>Don't open your left hand.</i>

12:52.480 --> 12:53.647
<i>Don't look down.</i>

12:55.024 --> 12:56.400
<i>Don't move.</i>

12:57.359 --> 12:59.445
<i>Don't open your left hand.</i>

12:59.528 --> 13:01.906
<i>Don't look down.</i>

13:03.991 --> 13:05.159
What the fuck?

13:06.118 --> 13:08.412
- <i>What did I just say?</i>

13:10.956 --> 13:12.291
Where's Quell?

13:12.374 --> 13:15.044
-It doesn't matter right now.
-Did he find her?

13:15.544 --> 13:17.213
You need to focus, Kovacs.

13:17.296 --> 13:19.298
I'm going to throw this rope down.

13:19.715 --> 13:20.966
You need to grab hold.

13:23.761 --> 13:26.472
-I need more!
-I can't lower it.

13:35.147 --> 13:37.191
-Kovacs!

13:39.819 --> 13:41.111
You can do this.

13:42.530 --> 13:44.365
Grab the rope.

13:46.492 --> 13:47.326
Fuck.

14:00.631 --> 14:02.800
Easy. I got you.

14:12.393 --> 14:14.520
Hang on. Almost there.

14:21.277 --> 14:23.821
Enable emergency medical scan.

14:24.321 --> 14:27.157
<i> Fourth and fifth ribs</i>
<i>fractured, evidence of concussion,</i>

14:27.241 --> 14:28.826
<i>dislocation of left shoulder.</i>

14:28.909 --> 14:30.369
You're lucky as shit.

14:31.328 --> 14:33.747
You passed out.
How the hell did you hang on?

14:33.831 --> 14:37.209
The sleeve has subconscious
survival reflexes.

14:38.127 --> 14:40.546
It's one of the perks.

14:42.256 --> 14:44.258
-Where's Quell?
-Gee!

14:44.592 --> 14:47.303
"Thanks, Trepp, for the rescue.
I owe you one."

14:47.386 --> 14:49.263
You were supposed to stay with her.

14:51.807 --> 14:57.104
Hey, your little lover girl put me
in a sleeper hold and took off.

14:58.063 --> 14:59.982
-I saw her with one of the Wedge.

15:00.482 --> 15:01.984
One I've never seen before.

15:03.277 --> 15:04.862
And they looked pretty cozy.

15:05.905 --> 15:10.618
Carrera, he copied my old DHF and shoved
it into a clone of my birth sleeve.

15:11.493 --> 15:14.663
I ran into him out here on the path
before he threw me off the cliff.

15:14.747 --> 15:16.582
So you did this to yourself.

15:17.041 --> 15:18.375
I'm a complicated person.

15:18.959 --> 15:22.171
-If he's with Quell, we have to find her.
-It's not just him.

15:22.254 --> 15:24.006
The whole team's out here.

15:24.256 --> 15:26.884
We need backup.
Did you get the signal out to Kemp?

15:29.178 --> 15:31.680
I tried.

15:36.226 --> 15:38.938
The charge is busted.
There's no way to tell.

15:40.689 --> 15:43.609
Fuck the cavalry.
We have to take them down ourselves.

15:43.692 --> 15:46.528
How? You're not exactly in fighting shape.

15:46.612 --> 15:48.489
And we have no weapons.

15:48.572 --> 15:50.115
We are the weapons.

15:50.908 --> 15:52.368
What the hell does that even mean?

15:58.666 --> 15:59.917
Thanks.

16:03.337 --> 16:06.924
-How deep did you bury this thing?
-Deeper than Tommy Shae's well.

16:08.258 --> 16:10.636
How do you know Tommy Shae?

16:10.719 --> 16:12.096
You told me about him.

16:13.180 --> 16:14.056
Remember?

16:14.640 --> 16:17.518
As a kid, you would hide in the dry well
in his property...

16:19.269 --> 16:21.355
waiting for your father's anger to pass.

16:23.399 --> 16:24.942
I'd stay down there for hours.

16:26.443 --> 16:28.612
You were always so good
at biding your time.

16:29.530 --> 16:31.115
Better even than me.

16:32.408 --> 16:33.993
It hurts to think of you like that.

16:36.120 --> 16:37.496
It doesn't matter, I lived.

16:37.579 --> 16:38.914
Of course it matters.

16:40.290 --> 16:44.169
The way you suffered allowed you
to see the suffering around you.

16:45.838 --> 16:47.256
It's what brought you to me.

16:51.802 --> 16:53.804
The Wedge are posted up
near the cavern.

16:54.346 --> 16:55.305
We're close.

16:55.973 --> 16:58.475
You'll need to hack their bodycams
and loop the feed.

16:58.559 --> 17:01.311
I can do it, but it's only a matter
of time before somebody notices.

17:01.395 --> 17:03.147
We'll need to work fast then.

17:10.779 --> 17:12.239
Relax, Carrera.

17:12.781 --> 17:15.117
Keep clenching and you'll pop something.

17:16.243 --> 17:20.080
There is no greater danger
than underestimating your enemy, Governor.

17:20.914 --> 17:22.166
Trust me, I know.

18:09.379 --> 18:10.756
Now we're even.

18:14.676 --> 18:15.969
You sure it's here?

18:18.263 --> 18:21.517
The best place to hide something
from someone is the first place they look.

18:21.975 --> 18:23.560
If it's obvious, no one looks close.

18:25.437 --> 18:28.607
When you come into this place,
what's the first thing you see?

18:29.691 --> 18:30.943
The Songspire.

18:33.904 --> 18:36.240
This tree dates back
to the time of the Elders.

18:37.574 --> 18:38.575
It's borne witness.

18:40.494 --> 18:41.662
It holds many secrets.

19:34.965 --> 19:35.883
Tell me.

19:37.217 --> 19:38.343
What bothers you more,

19:39.052 --> 19:42.681
that a Harlan's giving you commands
or that you're obeying them?

19:42.764 --> 19:46.894
I prefer my superiors to earn their title,
not be born to it.

19:47.519 --> 19:50.814
Power isn't something you earn,
it's something you take.

19:52.232 --> 19:55.402
Until you understand that,
you'll never see the bigger picture.

19:55.903 --> 19:56.862
Speaking of which,

19:57.446 --> 19:59.865
did you train your Wedge
to stand that still,

20:00.490 --> 20:01.575
or are they dead?

20:03.160 --> 20:04.578
The feeds are looping.

20:04.661 --> 20:06.413
Wedge, report in, do you copy?

20:20.344 --> 20:22.221
We got them, Colonel. Permission to kill?

20:22.638 --> 20:23.805
Permission granted.

20:39.112 --> 20:40.447
Takeshi Kovacs, I presume.

20:41.031 --> 20:42.115
Nice entrance.

20:42.699 --> 20:43.951
It's very dramatic.

20:44.785 --> 20:45.953
You got our signal?

20:46.703 --> 20:49.706
We came as soon as we heard.
Gather their weapons.

20:56.672 --> 20:57.923
That's Joshua Kemp.

21:00.217 --> 21:03.053
Kill her now and get out of there.
The Wedge has been ambushed.

21:03.929 --> 21:06.223
Move a muscle
and you just dug your own grave.

21:07.057 --> 21:08.892
You have someone with Falconer?

21:09.559 --> 21:11.728
<i>Repeat,</i>
<i>finish her now and move out.</i>

21:11.812 --> 21:13.772
<i>There's no weapon here, is there?</i>

21:14.690 --> 21:16.566
I looked in your eyes and I knew.

21:18.068 --> 21:19.987
You are Takeshi Kovacs,

21:21.071 --> 21:24.533
but you are not <i>my </i>Takeshi Kovacs.

21:45.345 --> 21:47.472
You're only pretending to be
one of the monsters.

22:01.653 --> 22:03.155
-Am I interrupting?

22:05.615 --> 22:07.784
-So that's you?
-I told you, it's complicated.

22:10.662 --> 22:13.123
Quellcrist Falconer, Joshua Kemp.

22:13.915 --> 22:15.000
I've heard of you.

22:17.878 --> 22:19.296
What the hell are you doing?

22:19.838 --> 22:21.048
You understand my caution.

22:21.131 --> 22:23.842
I have a lot of enemies who'd readily
use your face against me.

22:24.926 --> 22:26.428
I need to confirm who you really are.

22:28.013 --> 22:29.681
<i>Who the hell is in there?</i>

22:29.765 --> 22:32.559
An asset I called in from off-planet.
He has a history with Kovacs.

22:32.642 --> 22:34.936
Kovacs, who is not dead,

22:35.020 --> 22:38.440
who has now joined Kemp's rebellion
along with Falconer?

22:39.191 --> 22:42.694
Tell Captain Veutin I need a unit
dispatched to Stronghold immediately.

22:42.778 --> 22:45.864
These aren't prisoners
for your second-rate soldiers to steal.

22:45.947 --> 22:47.157
My man will handle this.

22:47.240 --> 22:48.700
Your man is in handcuffs.

22:48.784 --> 22:50.786
He's come through in worse situations.

22:52.287 --> 22:54.956
I don't know what game
it is you're playing, Colonel,

22:55.040 --> 22:56.833
but whatever it is, it's over.

23:05.884 --> 23:07.969
<i>Tell Kemp he's making a mistake.</i>

23:08.678 --> 23:12.265
You can tell him yourself...
after the Ascertainment.

23:13.892 --> 23:15.644
What the hell is an Ascertainment?

23:15.727 --> 23:17.187
It's an Envoy ritual

23:17.270 --> 23:20.190
to prove you are who you say you are,
no matter what sleeve you're wearing.

23:20.273 --> 23:22.734
If she's who she says she is,
you've got nothing to worry about.

23:22.818 --> 23:24.611
She's been down for centuries.

23:25.028 --> 23:27.864
-What if she fails?
-Then you're all dead.

23:29.741 --> 23:30.575
Great.

23:32.619 --> 23:33.787
So let me guess.

23:34.204 --> 23:37.290
You thought you were running the op
and she had you the whole time?

23:37.666 --> 23:42.129
She didn't kill me. I guess she was
still too attached to this face.

23:56.017 --> 23:57.644
You know how this works.

23:59.771 --> 24:02.065
I ask the questions and you answer them...

24:03.191 --> 24:05.902
truthfully and without hesitation.

24:17.581 --> 24:21.376
You fought against extending the human
lifespan beyond its natural bounds.

24:23.295 --> 24:27.048
Yet here you are...
after hundreds of years.

24:27.132 --> 24:28.633
How do you justify your hypoc--

24:34.389 --> 24:36.266
Hypocrisy implies choice.

24:36.808 --> 24:38.435
I was brought back against my will,

24:39.519 --> 24:40.729
but I am an Envoy.

24:42.063 --> 24:43.607
I take what is offered.

24:44.524 --> 24:47.694
-Haven't they heard of a lie detector?
-That wouldn't work on an Envoy.

24:48.236 --> 24:50.655
Quell taught perfect control
of mind and body.

24:50.739 --> 24:53.700
-They're testing both.
- Quellcrist is not your real name.

24:53.783 --> 24:56.286
You took it when you began your war
against the Protectorate.

24:56.369 --> 24:59.039
That's no secret.
You could learn that in any history book.

24:59.122 --> 25:01.041
They don't say why you chose it.

25:01.124 --> 25:05.378
I named myself after a common seaweed
that grows on Harlan's World.

25:06.880 --> 25:09.466
In a harsh environment, it becomes dust.

25:17.974 --> 25:21.353
But with a drop of water,
it grows back a hundredfold.

25:21.853 --> 25:25.023
I wanted a revolution
that couldn't be killed,

25:25.106 --> 25:27.484
a rebellion
that would rise again and again.

25:28.193 --> 25:31.863
They thought I was dead,
but I had only dried up.

25:32.447 --> 25:35.825
I found my water by the lake

25:36.493 --> 25:40.121
and all at once I was myself again.

25:42.123 --> 25:43.250
It worked.

25:46.962 --> 25:48.880
Ask me the question
you really want answered.

25:51.550 --> 25:53.760
Ask me about Marshall Kemp.

25:53.843 --> 25:56.263
-What do you know about him?
-He was a farmer.

25:57.305 --> 25:58.807
He gave us food.

25:59.849 --> 26:02.561
The Protectorate had him arrested
as a collaborator.

26:03.353 --> 26:05.564
When he refused to betray the Envoys,

26:05.981 --> 26:07.440
they came for his daughter...

26:08.775 --> 26:09.943
threatened her life.

26:10.777 --> 26:11.945
But they never found her.

26:13.697 --> 26:14.656
Why not?

26:17.033 --> 26:18.076
I protected her.

26:19.619 --> 26:24.416
Children should not be used
as instruments of war.

26:31.214 --> 26:33.049
That story's a family secret.

26:37.470 --> 26:38.972
There's no way you would know it.

26:40.348 --> 26:41.308
Unless...

26:42.225 --> 26:46.563
It is my honor to welcome you back
to The Uprising.

27:08.793 --> 27:10.629
Sorry about the restraints.

27:12.505 --> 27:13.632
What about me?

27:13.715 --> 27:16.926
I follow Falconer's orders.
She said nothing about you.

27:31.483 --> 27:33.777
- I need to break up a party.

27:34.861 --> 27:36.112
We have a lot to discuss.

27:36.655 --> 27:37.739
Let me catch you up.

27:39.032 --> 27:40.950
You can't take your eyes off of her.

27:42.994 --> 27:44.162
She's my mission.

27:44.829 --> 27:45.872
Mine too.

27:48.625 --> 27:50.043
At least I'm consistent.

27:52.921 --> 27:54.130
We're nothing alike.

27:56.716 --> 27:59.302
I remember what it was like to be you.

27:59.928 --> 28:01.846
CTAC's golden boy,

28:01.930 --> 28:05.767
<i>always itching for the next battle,</i>
<i>the rush of the fight.</i>

28:06.976 --> 28:09.854
<i>But nothing compares to the praise</i>
<i>you get after, right?</i>

28:10.689 --> 28:12.107
<i>"Good job, soldier.</i>

28:12.399 --> 28:13.858
<i>Missing accomplished."</i>

28:14.275 --> 28:15.985
<i>I used to eat that shit up.</i>

28:17.862 --> 28:19.322
<i>Does he still call you "son"?</i>

28:19.406 --> 28:20.573
Don't let him goad you.

28:21.074 --> 28:23.243
<i>This is your chance to get free.</i>

28:25.620 --> 28:27.288
He's listening right now, isn't he?

28:28.748 --> 28:31.835
It's cute how you think
you can get in my head.

28:33.128 --> 28:35.630
No, he did a good job, Jaeger,

28:36.256 --> 28:38.800
taking a broken boy
out of a bad situation,

28:38.883 --> 28:42.512
<i>giving him a gun and praising him</i>
<i>every time he would shoot to kill.</i>

28:42.595 --> 28:45.682
And if the boy thinks that's love,
all the better.

28:47.058 --> 28:47.892
After all,

28:48.393 --> 28:51.396
the way our dad treated us,
how would we know the difference?

28:52.188 --> 28:53.648
And you think she's better?

28:54.524 --> 28:56.109
She doesn't lie to me.

28:56.192 --> 28:58.153
She doesn't ask me to lie to myself.

29:00.780 --> 29:03.450
The Protectorate protects.

29:05.660 --> 29:07.787
Isn't that what you beat into us, Jaeger?

29:09.998 --> 29:12.083
<i>I've worked so hard to believe it.</i>

29:14.335 --> 29:16.796
I used to dream of Reileen,

29:17.422 --> 29:19.048
the family she'd have,

29:20.175 --> 29:21.718
the person she'd be.

29:23.011 --> 29:26.598
But even before I knew
they sold her to the Yakuza,

29:27.515 --> 29:29.142
part of me already knew.

29:30.435 --> 29:31.686
You know too.

29:32.854 --> 29:33.980
<i>And so does he.</i>

29:35.857 --> 29:39.360
The only thing the Protectorate protects
is itself.

29:39.444 --> 29:41.196
<i>Rei's proof enough of that.</i>

29:41.279 --> 29:43.531
He's twisting the truth.
That's not how it happened.

29:43.615 --> 29:48.745
I don't care who she became,
I would never have hurt her.

29:49.162 --> 29:51.080
You weren't there,
you didn't see what I saw.

29:51.164 --> 29:54.250
Spin it any way you want.
There's no justification for what you did.

29:54.334 --> 29:56.461
What kind of man kills his own sister?

29:56.544 --> 29:58.379
The same one who killed his father.

29:59.297 --> 30:00.965
I think she knew that.

30:03.635 --> 30:05.929
Maybe we are different after all.

30:07.722 --> 30:09.599
I was never afraid of the truth.

30:10.141 --> 30:12.227
<i>Enough of this sentimental shit.</i>

30:12.644 --> 30:14.187
<i>-Listen to me, soldier--</i>

30:21.945 --> 30:22.862
Tell me.

30:32.539 --> 30:33.498
We fought.

30:34.707 --> 30:35.708
That much you know.

30:37.836 --> 30:39.671
But she wasn't aiming to kill.

30:43.383 --> 30:45.760
<i>There were a million things</i>
<i>she could have done.</i>

30:47.136 --> 30:49.305
Fought back, bargained.

30:50.390 --> 30:51.850
She could've taken the gun.

30:51.933 --> 30:54.227
<i>Go on.</i> <i>Do it.</i>

30:56.855 --> 30:58.106
I'll never stop.

31:00.358 --> 31:01.526
<i>That's when I knew.</i>

31:07.866 --> 31:09.284
She wanted you to do it?

31:15.290 --> 31:16.708
I believe so.

31:18.793 --> 31:21.921
Still, I pulled the trigger.

31:23.798 --> 31:27.051
But her fate was sealed long before.

31:29.137 --> 31:33.057
The moment I let Jaeger draft me into CTAC

31:33.516 --> 31:35.768
and trusted him to take care of her.

31:37.437 --> 31:39.022
That was <i>our</i> mistake.

31:40.189 --> 31:42.734
We set all of it into motion.

31:43.526 --> 31:44.777
From then on,

31:45.194 --> 31:48.823
Rei was just riding on borrowed time.

32:09.844 --> 32:11.512
What happened to your man?

32:12.055 --> 32:13.056
I lost him.

32:16.517 --> 32:18.811
Get Veutin's unit up on the monitors.

32:31.699 --> 32:32.825
Commander Kemp.

32:33.785 --> 32:36.412
-I wanted to ask you about something.
-Go ahead.

32:38.915 --> 32:40.333
Do you recognize this man?

32:40.750 --> 32:42.418
No. Should I?

32:45.421 --> 32:50.176
Anil Imani, he's my brother.
He disappeared doing a job for you.

32:55.098 --> 32:57.183
I'm sorry. It's a big war.

32:57.558 --> 32:59.519
I don't know every soldier by name.

33:00.228 --> 33:01.521
He could still be out there.

33:02.188 --> 33:04.190
I'll circulate his image
among my lieutenants,

33:04.273 --> 33:05.692
see if we can get answers for you.

33:08.152 --> 33:11.572
So many families have suffered
from the Protectorate's atrocities.

33:14.826 --> 33:15.868
What are you doing?

33:18.830 --> 33:21.708
It's, uh... It's my coils.

33:22.583 --> 33:24.335
They get a bit touchy
when they're depleted.

33:24.419 --> 33:26.963
Do you mind if I borrow your charger
from your transmitter?

33:28.172 --> 33:29.007
Sure.

33:31.050 --> 33:32.051
Have at it.

33:56.492 --> 33:58.786
-Did you reach base?
-They told us to wait.

33:58.870 --> 34:01.039
There's a Protectorate satellite
passing overheard.

34:01.122 --> 34:02.832
If we leave now,
it'll pick up our movements.

34:02.915 --> 34:05.251
-How long before it passes?
-A couple of hours?

34:05.334 --> 34:07.462
If you take no risks,
you win no victories.

34:08.046 --> 34:09.714
If we leave now,
at least we stand a chance.

34:09.797 --> 34:13.509
This cave is a defensible position,
especially with your weapon.

34:14.802 --> 34:15.887
My weapon?

34:15.970 --> 34:19.390
You used something on those Meths.
Are you gonna hold out on me?

34:23.269 --> 34:25.772
Gather everyone, gear up.

34:26.355 --> 34:27.732
We move on my command.

34:29.192 --> 34:31.069
Of course. It's your call.

34:33.696 --> 34:34.822
We need to talk.

34:35.656 --> 34:37.241
I'm sorry about before...

34:39.452 --> 34:40.870
when I put my hands on you.

34:42.538 --> 34:45.541
I was finally coming back to myself
and I couldn't let you stop me.

34:47.168 --> 34:48.086
Thanks.

34:50.338 --> 34:51.547
But it's not that.

34:53.674 --> 34:54.550
It's Kemp.

34:56.177 --> 34:58.513
I checked the signal log on our beacon.

34:58.596 --> 35:01.599
The coordinates Kovacs was trying to send
never went through.

35:02.642 --> 35:05.770
Kemp never got our message,
so how did he find us?

35:06.854 --> 35:10.024
And when I asked him about Anil,
he claimed he'd never met him.

35:12.527 --> 35:15.863
So why does he have his fucking stack
strung around his neck?

35:23.162 --> 35:24.831
It's time to even the odds.

35:37.802 --> 35:39.846
You sure you don't want to wait out
the satellite?

35:42.515 --> 35:43.391
How long?

35:43.891 --> 35:45.518
Uh, a few more hours I'd say.

35:45.601 --> 35:47.103
How long have you been a traitor?

35:50.356 --> 35:53.025
-The hell are you talking about?
- You know how this works.

35:53.109 --> 35:54.902
I ask the questions, you answer them.

35:55.403 --> 35:57.280
The truth is your only protection.

35:57.738 --> 35:59.031
Who do you work for?

36:02.076 --> 36:04.495
All warfare is based on deception.

36:05.538 --> 36:06.664
That's your saying, isn't it?

36:09.000 --> 36:12.211
I was wrong. She's not the real Falconer.

36:12.628 --> 36:14.463
Execute her, now!

36:24.807 --> 36:26.434
You're no revolutionary.

36:26.934 --> 36:29.520
I'm no revolutionary
because there is no revolution.

36:30.521 --> 36:32.440
What did your people die for?

36:32.857 --> 36:36.986
The peons fighting think this is all real.
It's just bloodthirsty play-acting.

36:37.445 --> 36:38.654
The story's already been written.

36:39.113 --> 36:41.157
You promised you'd spare me
if I told you the truth.

36:41.240 --> 36:42.867
I didn't promise you shit!

36:45.119 --> 36:47.705
The emblem on this is my family's crest.

36:48.247 --> 36:50.499
This is my brother's DHF.

36:50.583 --> 36:53.628
Your brother got himself killed
just like your--

36:55.129 --> 36:56.923
Don't. We need him alive.

36:57.381 --> 37:00.051
-He's our proof the war is a lie.
- You're too late.

37:00.134 --> 37:03.012
There was never a satellite.
It was always the Protectorate coming.

37:03.095 --> 37:05.640
Secure him,
gather whatever weapons you can carry.

37:05.723 --> 37:07.892
If we cut through the clearing,
we can take the back pass.

37:07.975 --> 37:09.477
-What about him?
-His choice.

37:10.603 --> 37:12.104
You think we can trust him?

37:13.356 --> 37:14.398
He's still you.

37:22.156 --> 37:23.115
- This way.
-Wait.

37:24.700 --> 37:25.534
Oh, shit.

37:28.246 --> 37:29.455
<i>Target engaged.</i>

37:30.289 --> 37:31.499
Is that who I think it is?

37:36.754 --> 37:39.298
<i>Don't shoot. Don't shoot.</i>
<i>I'm on your side!</i>

37:39.674 --> 37:40.549
Stop right there.

37:41.801 --> 37:43.094
Kemp was your man.

37:44.345 --> 37:47.390
That's how he knew where to find my team.
You told them where they were.

37:50.559 --> 37:51.727
Kovacs.

37:51.811 --> 37:52.937
Something's happening.

37:53.020 --> 37:56.315
Call Danica Harlan.
She'll tell you I work for her.

37:56.399 --> 37:57.358
Veutin, shut him up.

38:05.074 --> 38:06.826
The war, the ceasefire,

38:06.909 --> 38:09.662
you've been running it all
from the inside.

38:09.745 --> 38:10.705
This is treason.

38:11.205 --> 38:14.125
-Protectorate will remove you.
- How?

38:15.126 --> 38:16.335
The planet's dark.

38:16.752 --> 38:17.586
Arrest him.

38:22.341 --> 38:23.551
This will never stand.

38:23.634 --> 38:26.554
You have no grounds to arrest me.

38:28.514 --> 38:31.392
That's your asset
wearing the Envoy's birth sleeve.

38:31.475 --> 38:33.477
Double sleeving is a capital crime.

38:33.561 --> 38:35.438
I've got all the ammunition I need.

38:46.490 --> 38:47.408
Cover!

38:55.666 --> 38:57.209
I can't hold it!
