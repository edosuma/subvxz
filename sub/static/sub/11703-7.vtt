00:01.589 --> 00:04.716
I'd like to hear Franky talk.
You can say whatever you like.

00:04.767 --> 00:09.310
So, if you've got any blood on your hands,
now's the time to wash some of it off.

00:09.321 --> 00:11.240
Sophie! Soph.
She's drunk.

00:11.323 --> 00:12.992
Get out of the way!

00:14.117 --> 00:15.827
Shut your mouth! I will kill you.

00:15.911 --> 00:17.788
Franky! Franky, let her go.

00:18.998 --> 00:21.042
I want to understand where
that aggression's coming from.

00:21.208 --> 00:24.461
She is beyond help. Oh, I disagree.
I think there's something else going on.

00:24.545 --> 00:26.379
Your opinion is irrelevant.

00:28.966 --> 00:33.345
Well, Bea should be here.
Where is she? I want Bea!

00:34.304 --> 00:37.709
Prisoner advocate Smith will not be
able to take part in this hearing.

00:37.719 --> 00:40.679
She's, ah, incapacitated.

00:42.000 --> 00:48.074

01:43.998 --> 01:47.015
You don't remember any of that?
No.

01:51.195 --> 01:55.214
I fucking killed him!
I killed Harry Smith.

01:57.666 --> 01:59.837
I don't have psychotic episodes.

01:59.918 --> 02:01.003
I don't.

02:05.787 --> 02:07.919
You're a murderer!

02:11.013 --> 02:13.105
I know it's confronting but you can
see for yourself what happened.

02:13.225 --> 02:16.280
I told you, I was grabbed
from behind near the boiler room.

02:17.084 --> 02:19.136
The man in the mirror.

02:20.783 --> 02:22.752
That's the last thing I remember.

02:23.878 --> 02:26.533
Post-traumatic stress
can cause delusions.

02:31.598 --> 02:35.618
He was real. We've been over this,
Bea. There was no man.

02:35.739 --> 02:39.316
Now, according to your medical
history, you suffered a similar

02:39.436 --> 02:41.528
breakdown following
the death of your daughter.

02:41.607 --> 02:42.573
No.

02:44.181 --> 02:45.909
What about CCTV?

02:46.029 --> 02:49.206
Can you check the CCTV?
It'll prove that I'm right.

02:49.327 --> 02:51.738
I'm sure that's already been done...
Could you just check it, please?

02:51.818 --> 02:53.669
Please. Please.

02:55.599 --> 02:57.849
Alright. I'm not psychotic.

02:59.297 --> 03:00.664
OK.

03:05.488 --> 03:09.267
She's sticking to her story about
an intruder near the boiler room.

03:09.347 --> 03:10.312
Ridiculous.

03:11.116 --> 03:14.171
Has the CCTV been checked?
We are not entertaining

03:14.252 --> 03:15.740
an inmate's fantasies, Ms Westfall.

03:15.819 --> 03:18.513
While these delusions persist,

03:18.634 --> 03:22.333
Smith will remain in the Psych Unit,
for her own welfare.

03:32.746 --> 03:37.448
Have you checked the CCTV?
What do you think? Of course.

03:37.529 --> 03:39.419
What about the adjacent rooms?

03:39.539 --> 03:41.831
Just what are you
expecting to find?

03:41.951 --> 03:43.518
There were contractors
there yesterday.

03:43.640 --> 03:46.897
Only electricians in D Block.
They were nowhere near that area.

03:47.017 --> 03:50.113
Unless of course they managed to
walk through several walls,

03:50.234 --> 03:53.368
prise open security gates,
bypass all the cameras.

03:53.489 --> 03:56.505
Or perhaps Smith
is having a breakdown.

03:56.947 --> 03:58.394
You choose.

04:06.233 --> 04:08.887
Thanks, Franky. And they're
not for you, so no snacking.

04:08.968 --> 04:10.937
I'll try to restrain myself.

04:12.867 --> 04:16.243
Gidget. I'm doing an admission.
I can't hang around.

04:16.363 --> 04:19.300
Hey, what happened to Red?
Jodie was relying on her.

04:19.379 --> 04:20.906
Franky, you know the deal.

04:21.067 --> 04:25.048
Happy to talk about your situation,
not other inmates'. Would you like to talk?

04:25.169 --> 04:28.746
I'd like to do a lot of things.
I have a free slot this afternoon.

04:28.827 --> 04:31.279
Do you want me to fill it?

04:32.687 --> 04:35.782
I want you to be serious.
I am.

04:40.567 --> 04:43.218
You must be Kim Chang.
Franky!

04:45.792 --> 04:46.758
Hey.

04:47.761 --> 04:50.053
Miss me?
What the fuck you doing back here?

04:50.134 --> 04:53.110
What do you reckon? I missed you.

04:53.190 --> 04:54.637
Back in the office.

04:55.883 --> 04:56.847
Bye.

04:59.301 --> 05:00.587
Work to do.

05:05.330 --> 05:08.265
Oi! Where's the slagger?

05:08.425 --> 05:11.361
Oh, don't call her that.
No, where is she? I don't know.

05:11.481 --> 05:14.014
You know the bitch has
stolen me brew, hey.

05:14.134 --> 05:17.953
Oh, Booms... No, it's all gone
and she's off her frickin' chops.

05:18.073 --> 05:21.291
It doesn't take a genius to figure
out who's been nicking it, hey.

05:21.411 --> 05:22.898
Hey, hey. Calm down.
Hey, where's your Mum?

05:23.020 --> 05:25.230
She's gone to Medical.
Yeah?

05:25.390 --> 05:27.482
Well she'll be fuckin' moving in
there by the time I'm finished with her.

05:27.642 --> 05:30.015
Oh, she doesn't mean that.
No, I do mean that. I do fuckin' mean that.

05:30.135 --> 05:33.029
Shut up. Don't worry about it.
I'll take care of it.

05:33.110 --> 05:34.638
OK.

05:34.719 --> 05:36.889
You, leave Liz alone.

05:37.010 --> 05:39.342
Look, I don't even want
to see you talking to Liz.

05:40.748 --> 05:42.196
'Attention compound...'
OK?

05:42.316 --> 05:44.527
'..all inmates report to
their assigned work duties.'

05:44.648 --> 05:47.059
Whatever.
I'm going to take that as a yes.

05:47.140 --> 05:48.588
Come on.

06:34.618 --> 06:36.630
Find anything?

06:38.479 --> 06:42.097
No. I was just being thorough.

06:47.042 --> 06:51.384
I'm surprised at you, Vera,
indulging prisoners' fantasies.

06:51.463 --> 06:53.112
She did seem quite adamant.

06:54.800 --> 06:57.615
Adamant? Oh, oh, my apologies.

06:57.735 --> 07:00.590
That makes all the difference then,
doesn't it?

07:21.614 --> 07:25.313
Ms Bennett. About Smith.

07:25.394 --> 07:28.972
I, um, I've checked the cameras,

07:29.092 --> 07:31.383
the corridor and the boiler room.
There's nothing.

07:31.464 --> 07:33.797
Right. OK.

07:35.404 --> 07:36.731
Thanks.

07:52.330 --> 07:53.295
Hi.

07:55.828 --> 07:57.798
So, did you find anything?

07:57.918 --> 08:01.375
There's absolutely no evidence
there was an intruder in the prison.

08:01.456 --> 08:02.902
But what about the CCTV?

08:03.023 --> 08:05.395
Did you check that?
It's been checked.

08:07.044 --> 08:10.100
Bea, we need to work out
why this happened.

08:10.220 --> 08:12.149
Where this sudden anxiety
came from, yeah?

08:16.893 --> 08:19.907
I need to use the bathroom.
You can use the bedpan.

08:21.516 --> 08:23.003
She seems pretty calm.

08:23.124 --> 08:26.904
Can't she use the bathroom?
Yeah, alright.

08:35.990 --> 08:39.044
So, when you get up,
you might feel a little woozy, yeah?

08:41.779 --> 08:43.788
Yeah? Yeah.

08:47.928 --> 08:50.099
Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Bea, calm down.

08:50.221 --> 08:52.592
He was there. Who was there?
The man.

08:52.753 --> 08:56.049
The man that got me in
the corridor. He's here. Calm down, Bea.

08:56.170 --> 08:58.905
He's here! No-one's here.
I just saw him! Please!

08:59.026 --> 09:01.719
He's in the mirror. He's here!
Look in the mirror, Bea.

09:01.839 --> 09:04.211
There's no-one there.
I just saw him in the mirror!

09:04.332 --> 09:05.780
There's no-one there.
Did you not see him?

09:05.900 --> 09:08.834
I want you to look...
Get him! He's in here!

09:08.995 --> 09:10.885
I'm going to get you back to your bed.
You should be looking for him!

09:11.006 --> 09:13.055
Please! Nurse, we're
going to need sedation.

09:13.175 --> 09:15.668
There's no-one there.
Get off me! Please, he was here!

09:15.748 --> 09:18.443
I'm not seeing things, please!

09:18.523 --> 09:21.216
Get your fucking hands off me.

09:21.337 --> 09:25.678
Please, I saw him.
No, I saw him.

09:25.760 --> 09:29.097
He's here. He's still here...

09:30.623 --> 09:32.472
I saw him.
It's just your mind

09:32.593 --> 09:35.085
playing tricks on you, Bea.
I saw him here.

09:35.206 --> 09:38.866
It's alright.
Please, I saw him here.

09:38.986 --> 09:42.402
She'll be out for a few hours.
I might sit with her for a while.

09:42.523 --> 09:46.101
There's no need. The nurse is here.
She'll be here so...

09:56.113 --> 10:01.699
Hey. What'd you do?
Ah, broke parole.

10:01.780 --> 10:03.991
You're a fucking idiot.

10:04.113 --> 10:07.166
Hey, I wanted to see you.
So fuckin' visit.

10:10.503 --> 10:15.690
Everything was shit outside,
Franky. I couldn't hack it.

10:17.499 --> 10:19.790
I thought you were
smarter than that.

10:21.358 --> 10:27.067
Frank, hey, don't be angry.

10:28.554 --> 10:30.887
I'm glad to be back.

10:30.967 --> 10:33.621
They've put me in the new wing, H6.

10:33.701 --> 10:38.243
Close... enough... to visit.

10:40.898 --> 10:43.511
I bet you missed me too.

10:57.340 --> 10:58.988
It's been a while.

11:12.336 --> 11:16.998
Stop. Just fuckin' stop!

11:19.972 --> 11:23.309
I just want to touch you.
Well, you can't. Why?

11:24.033 --> 11:28.777
Cos I'm not... I'm not interested.

11:34.606 --> 11:40.275
I only came back to see you.
I didn't ask you to come back.

11:43.249 --> 11:45.542
This is your fuck up, not mine.

11:54.708 --> 11:56.317
You should go.

12:36.096 --> 12:37.902
Have you got names picked out yet?

12:38.022 --> 12:40.232
Ah, not really.
I haven't decided yet.

12:40.312 --> 12:43.687
If it's a boy, I'm thinking Joshua.

12:43.808 --> 12:48.869
And if it's a girl?
I like Merinda. Oh...

12:51.239 --> 12:52.966
That's really pretty.

12:53.047 --> 12:54.934
Yeah, it means beautiful.

12:59.032 --> 13:02.245
Booms. Booms. Don't talk to me.

13:04.134 --> 13:06.946
I... I need some more grog.
Are you for real?

13:07.065 --> 13:09.276
I'm desperate and, ah,
I'm happy to pay for it.

13:09.396 --> 13:12.048
Look, I'm not a fucking
drive-thru, alright?

13:16.024 --> 13:19.117
Right, so you... you don't want
anyone to know. That's fine.

13:19.238 --> 13:23.295
Is everything alright, Liz? Yeah,
yeah, oh, no, it's good. Yeah.

13:25.706 --> 13:27.995
Didn't see her.
Mm-hmm.

13:35.708 --> 13:36.473
What?

13:59.570 --> 14:03.145
He was real...
We've been over this, Bea...

14:05.877 --> 14:07.844
There was no man... was no man...

15:05.179 --> 15:09.077
Oi, Smith.
You back from la-la land yet?

15:11.849 --> 15:14.138
What's going to happen when
we take these restraints off?

15:14.259 --> 15:18.517
I was thinking, you and me,
ocean cruise to Mexico?

15:18.639 --> 15:20.927
You try anything, I swear you're
going to be in a wet cell for...

15:21.047 --> 15:24.542
I'm just joking. I'm not going
to do anything, am I? Look at me.

15:33.702 --> 15:37.037
Can I go back to my unit?
Not till the Governor says so.

15:40.570 --> 15:43.022
OK, time for a shower.

15:43.143 --> 15:45.672
I don't want one.
Don't argue with me, Smith.

15:45.792 --> 15:49.368
I'm not in the mood.
I need to do some obs first.

15:49.489 --> 15:52.341
You had a temperature yesterday.
Right, call me when you're ready.

15:58.768 --> 16:00.977
Now, how're you feeling?

16:01.059 --> 16:03.670
Thirsty. I need a drink of water.

16:05.356 --> 16:07.888
Are you hungry?
You should probably eat something.

16:10.739 --> 16:12.467
Yeah, yeah, I'm starving.

16:12.547 --> 16:14.958
I'll organise some food for you.

16:17.287 --> 16:19.095
That'd be great. Thanks.

16:26.887 --> 16:28.936
Can I please see
a Peer Worker as well?

16:29.056 --> 16:31.629
You'll have to clear
that with Ms Miles. OK.

16:31.709 --> 16:33.276
Thanks.

17:08.345 --> 17:10.876
Ms Bennett, can I help
you with something?

17:10.954 --> 17:14.169
No, I've got what I need.

17:16.618 --> 17:18.267
You've still got that flu?

17:21.520 --> 17:22.484
Vera?

18:58.172 --> 19:02.350
The day of the riot,
someone put a syringe to my neck.

19:02.470 --> 19:04.518
It wasn't me.
Who was it?

19:04.599 --> 19:07.452
How do I know?

19:07.572 --> 19:10.183
If you don't know,
you could find out.

19:11.186 --> 19:13.476
You want to make parole or not?

19:18.497 --> 19:20.908
I did you a favour
when I dropped that charge.

19:21.029 --> 19:24.282
I can easily reinstate it.
I'm not a lagger. Why don't you

19:24.402 --> 19:26.572
try Liz? She's got a mouth
like the Grand Canyon.

19:26.692 --> 19:29.062
I'm asking you.
And I'm telling ya, I don't know.

19:29.183 --> 19:32.517
You've got till tonight
to get me a name.

20:01.723 --> 20:03.689
You've got five minutes.
OK.

20:03.770 --> 20:06.462
Hey, how're you feeling?

20:06.582 --> 20:10.640
OK. Hey, what happened yesterday?
You totally lost it.

20:10.720 --> 20:13.612
Hey, I need you to take this, OK?

20:13.732 --> 20:17.269
Just... just get a zip lock bag
from the kitchen and

20:17.388 --> 20:20.682
just put it in. Don't unwrap it,
alright? And whatever you do,

20:20.802 --> 20:22.731
don't get it wet and I'll
come and get it off you

20:22.810 --> 20:24.659
when I get out of here, OK?
It's really important.

20:24.780 --> 20:26.789
What is it?
It doesn't matter.

20:26.868 --> 20:28.475
Well, it does matter!

20:28.596 --> 20:30.364
Cos I can't get in trouble
right now, Bea.

20:30.443 --> 20:32.090
I've got the baby to think about.

20:32.210 --> 20:35.586
Doreen please, please,
can you just trust me?

20:35.665 --> 20:37.755
Trust you?

20:37.875 --> 20:40.405
Remember how that
worked out for Liz?

20:43.539 --> 20:46.953
OK, somebody did something
to me yesterday

20:47.073 --> 20:49.404
and this is proof, OK?
Proof of what?

20:49.524 --> 20:52.577
Now, sorry but
we need to do more obs.

20:52.658 --> 20:53.621
OK.

21:09.180 --> 21:15.019
Oh, sorry.
Hey. Have you seen Bea yet?

21:15.744 --> 21:17.192
Yeah.

21:17.273 --> 21:19.084
Well, what... what happened?

21:19.166 --> 21:21.098
Not sure, but she's feeling better.

21:21.179 --> 21:22.747
That's good.

21:24.359 --> 21:26.492
Dor, I just wanted to, um,

21:27.500 --> 21:29.956
come and tell you I'm sorry,
because I've been a little bit...

21:29.995 --> 21:32.412
you know, I've been a bit...
just a bit all over the place lately.

21:32.531 --> 21:35.431
Oh, you mean pissed.
Yeah. Pissed.

21:35.551 --> 21:39.818
And ah, the thing is, what happens
is once I get started, I can't stop

21:39.939 --> 21:43.200
and I try. Fahhh...
I try really hard and there

21:43.362 --> 21:46.381
are moments when I can...
There are moments when I can stop and

21:46.503 --> 21:49.643
I can talk myself out of it,
then there's other times

21:49.722 --> 21:51.817
when it just takes... it takes over.

21:51.936 --> 21:54.512
Is that how you're feeling?
Right now?

21:55.602 --> 21:57.975
Yep, but there's no booze.

21:58.822 --> 22:02.444
But if there was, you'd be pissed.

22:02.566 --> 22:04.860
It feels like I don't have
a choice sometimes.

22:04.940 --> 22:07.196
Oh, of course you've got a choice.

22:08.443 --> 22:10.981
You've got a daughter in here now.

22:11.142 --> 22:15.327
Yeah, I know. Look, if you've come in here
expecting sympathy, forget it.

22:15.407 --> 22:16.937
I need to protect my baby.

22:17.058 --> 22:20.319
Oh, Dor, you don't have to
protect your baby from me.

22:20.399 --> 22:21.368
Well, prove it.

22:23.258 --> 22:25.954
Stay sober,
then come and talk to me.

22:54.943 --> 22:56.472
Oh, you...

23:29.359 --> 23:33.212
Bridget? That verbal abuse charge,
the one that Ms B dropped?

23:33.332 --> 23:36.264
She's threatening to reinstate it
and fuck my parole.

23:36.386 --> 23:38.516
I was a witness
when she withdrew it.

23:38.635 --> 23:42.048
Won't be a good look
if she changes her mind.

23:42.127 --> 23:45.901
Hey. So, you've got my back?

23:49.114 --> 23:50.360
Yeah.

23:53.092 --> 23:54.455
Thanks.

23:55.458 --> 23:58.510
Hey, Ms Westfall, I think you
might be interested in this.

23:58.632 --> 24:00.117
I've got Bea Smith's
tox report back.

24:08.711 --> 24:11.039
So, can I get out of here yet?

24:11.158 --> 24:14.171
Not up to me.
Your bloods just came back.

24:14.291 --> 24:16.781
You had an hallucinogenic
in your system.

24:17.948 --> 24:20.274
So I was drugged?
So, you didn't take them yourself?

24:20.357 --> 24:22.442
No. I don't do that shit.

24:24.250 --> 24:26.820
So, how did they get
in your system, then?

24:26.941 --> 24:30.755
That man.
That man must have drugged me.

24:30.835 --> 24:33.566
And why would he want to drug you?

24:37.299 --> 24:40.192
Jodie.
I had to get to Jodie.

24:40.313 --> 24:42.722
I was supposed to be at her hearing,
but she stopped me.

24:42.842 --> 24:46.216
Jodie? No, Ferguson.
So not the man?

24:46.335 --> 24:48.987
No, no, no, no,
the man works for Ferguson.

24:50.270 --> 24:51.717
It was her.

24:54.165 --> 24:58.663
She got the man to drug me
so I flipped out.

24:58.744 --> 24:59.708
It was Ferguson.

25:03.200 --> 25:06.412
Well, that is quite a story.
Yes, it sounds ridiculous.

25:06.532 --> 25:09.464
That's because it is ridiculous
and it is getting more...

25:09.583 --> 25:12.353
I do not understand why you're
entertaining this. I mean,

25:12.474 --> 25:15.205
you do realise that falsely
accusing corrections personnel,

25:15.326 --> 25:18.700
that carries very serious
consequences, yes?

25:19.382 --> 25:21.352
Was there something else?

25:22.514 --> 25:25.245
The LSD in her system
caused the psychosis,

25:25.407 --> 25:30.947
but she's come down now. So, I think she
is ready for release from the Psych Unit.

25:31.067 --> 25:34.320
I appreciate your opinion.
Meaning you're ignoring it.

25:35.405 --> 25:37.854
We now have proof
she's a drug user.

25:38.897 --> 25:40.183
How can you guarantee
she won't use again and have

25:40.302 --> 25:43.033
further episodes?
There is no history of drug use.

25:43.114 --> 25:45.524
She's been clean since she arrived.

25:45.886 --> 25:48.775
Well, I think the results
speak for themselves.

25:48.897 --> 25:51.947
I don't think she took
that LSD knowingly.

25:52.068 --> 25:54.759
Meaning what? One of the women
spiked her food and drink?

25:54.878 --> 25:59.055
Now, whatever the causes, while
Smith insists that these delusions

25:59.176 --> 26:02.548
are real, she will be kept under
observation, for her own safety.

26:02.669 --> 26:04.917
You can't keep her
restrained indefinitely.

26:05.683 --> 26:07.047
If these delusions persist,
she may have to be moved to

26:07.164 --> 26:09.012
a proper psychiatric facility.

26:09.134 --> 26:11.022
Right, I could take this
to the Board, you know.

26:11.102 --> 26:12.989
They will listen to me.

26:14.955 --> 26:18.169
Well, if you enjoy the paperwork
so much, by all means, go ahead.

26:24.996 --> 26:28.006
No, I fuckin' know.
She fucked me, too.

26:28.128 --> 26:30.176
Not in that way, but she fucked
me over. Fuckin' skanky bitch.

26:30.296 --> 26:34.149
And you reckon... Oh, hello, hello.
Hey, you!

26:34.270 --> 26:37.322
What's with you and Franky, huh?
Are you fucking?

26:37.443 --> 26:40.012
I beg your pardon?
Chang, move away from the fence.

26:40.133 --> 26:42.502
She only gets bored of me
when she finds a new fuck.

26:42.584 --> 26:44.068
Move away now.

26:47.563 --> 26:50.575
You should sack her.
She's fucking a prisoner.

26:51.497 --> 26:53.344
Don't be ridiculous.

26:54.629 --> 26:57.358
That was awesome!
What a stupid bitch. I know.

27:01.015 --> 27:02.618
Ms Westfall?

27:04.910 --> 27:07.278
What was that about?
No idea.

27:07.359 --> 27:09.567
But I'll get to the bottom of it.

27:15.711 --> 27:18.521
'Attention compound.
Reporting to work units.'

27:25.629 --> 27:28.722
Who used the syringe?
Pick a name.

27:28.842 --> 27:30.808
If you want to get out of here,
you will do what I ask.

27:30.927 --> 27:34.221
It's too late. You dropped
the charge. Bridget's my witness.

27:34.302 --> 27:35.907
You can't do shit.

27:37.113 --> 27:41.046
What makes you think Ms Westfall
would help you? Just know.

27:49.842 --> 27:51.168
It's just gossip.

27:51.288 --> 27:55.180
I don't have any proof,
but we should keep an eye on them.

27:57.069 --> 27:59.357
Don't mention this to anyone else.

27:59.438 --> 28:01.927
I'll handle it in my own way.

28:02.008 --> 28:02.973
Yes, Governor.

28:33.248 --> 28:37.265
Easy, ladies. Ooh, yummy, yum, yum.
That looks good, doesn't it?

28:41.040 --> 28:42.403
Boomer, Boomer!

28:42.525 --> 28:45.335
Oh, Booms. I have to...
I have to thank you for that brew.

28:45.455 --> 28:47.101
What?
Huh?

28:47.261 --> 28:50.474
Oh, you're like a little fairy. You're just
tucking it in there, under my pillow.

28:50.555 --> 28:53.849
No, I'm not a fuckin' fairy.
You've been fuckin' flogging it.

28:53.970 --> 28:56.700
Shhh! Oh, go on, that's good.
That's good.

28:56.821 --> 28:58.784
But hey, it's alright,
it's alright, I know.

28:58.867 --> 29:00.593
Your secret's safe with me, Booms.

29:00.714 --> 29:04.006
I know that you're trying to
keep it away from Max. I know.

29:04.087 --> 29:06.256
I get it, I get it. Fuck off!

29:06.377 --> 29:09.308
You're nuts. Everyone around
here is fuckin' nuts!

29:10.875 --> 29:13.966
It's funny. You're funny.
Max.

29:17.741 --> 29:20.068
Ladies. Hello, hello.

29:20.189 --> 29:23.122
Dors, I was gonna...
I was gonna give you my dessert.

29:23.243 --> 29:25.169
Ice cream.
I know you like ice cream.

29:25.288 --> 29:29.103
You're pissed again.
Hey? Oh, rack off, Jessica.

29:29.223 --> 29:32.075
I can smell you from over here.
It's disgusting.

29:32.158 --> 29:34.405
No, I just farted.

29:34.524 --> 29:37.256
Oh! There's another one.
Oh! There's another one.

29:37.377 --> 29:41.109
Seriously, what mother gets pissed
in front of her daughter?

29:41.229 --> 29:45.887
Just leave it. It's good you got
rid of her as carer. Yummy.

29:51.752 --> 29:55.003
What's Kim Chang's problem?
She must be jealous.

29:56.048 --> 29:58.056
What of?

29:58.135 --> 29:59.459
Well, you tell me.

30:00.665 --> 30:02.995
This is your session, Franky.
You asked for it.

30:04.842 --> 30:08.297
Ah, I was hoping we'd have
something to talk about.

30:08.456 --> 30:12.793
What do you want to hear?
What was that shit with Liz the other day?

30:12.911 --> 30:16.647
It was nothin'. Nothin'?
You've got anger issues, Franky.

30:16.768 --> 30:19.741
You've got to deal with them.
You've got to stop self-sabotaging.

30:19.820 --> 30:21.464
I want to recommend you for parole.

30:21.627 --> 30:25.239
Now, how am I going to do that when you're
throttling prisoners in the corridor?

30:25.361 --> 30:27.930
You think you know what it's like
in here, but you don't.

30:28.051 --> 30:29.857
You do what you
gotta do to survive.

30:29.978 --> 30:33.070
Cos if you don't,
you have shit done to ya.

30:33.191 --> 30:34.985
I learnt that pretty quick
when I got in here.

30:34.996 --> 30:36.926
But your problems started
before you got in here.

30:37.046 --> 30:41.944
If you want to work through them,
you're going to have to dig deep.

30:42.064 --> 30:44.394
Come on, we've all
got baggage, Franky.

30:44.514 --> 30:46.684
Unless you unpack it,
it stays locked up.

30:47.807 --> 30:50.659
Weighs us down. Spare me
the fuckin' cliches! Come on!

30:50.780 --> 30:53.549
Well spare me the fuckin'
run-around, yeah? I'm sick of it.

30:53.669 --> 30:55.556
If you waste these sessions,
there's no point in having them.

30:55.677 --> 30:58.288
Don't you ever get bored of
people chewing your ear off?

30:58.448 --> 31:02.503
You have got a serious emotional block that prevents
you from trusting anyone. Now, I get that.

31:02.623 --> 31:05.876
But you're going to
have to break through it.

31:08.849 --> 31:11.780
It began when you
were a kid, didn't it?

31:12.822 --> 31:15.192
That's when you started
building this wall.

31:18.605 --> 31:21.295
I know about your childhood.
No you fuckin' don't.

31:21.417 --> 31:23.866
I read about it.
I lived it.

31:25.353 --> 31:26.798
Must have been tough.

31:26.879 --> 31:28.402
After your Dad left.

31:28.522 --> 31:30.332
Daddy!
He doesn't want you!

31:31.898 --> 31:34.547
You want to talk about your Mum?
We're not talking about her.

31:34.666 --> 31:36.797
Why not?
Cos I don't give a shit about her.

31:36.916 --> 31:39.084
It's pretty clear she had
a major impact on you.

31:39.167 --> 31:40.692
We are not talking about her...

31:40.812 --> 31:42.899
She did some pretty
terrible things to you.

31:43.019 --> 31:45.869
That doesn't mean you deserved them.
It's all your fault.

31:45.990 --> 31:48.401
Why do you think he left?
I want to stop the session.

31:48.520 --> 31:52.414
You didn't deserve any of
that shit, so don't take it on.

31:56.111 --> 31:59.563
Right, let's talk about the anger, Franky,
because that's what's driving you.

31:59.682 --> 32:02.174
That's what's been in control
ever since you were a little kid.

32:02.214 --> 32:04.141
The real you got lost.

32:04.260 --> 32:06.269
You need to shut up.
You're a good person, Franky.

32:06.390 --> 32:08.879
I'm not a good person!
Yes, you are.

32:09.001 --> 32:11.770
No! Because if I saw her,
I'd cut her throat.

32:11.890 --> 32:13.738
So how the hell does
that make me good?

32:13.857 --> 32:15.545
It makes you angry.
I'd fuckin' kill her!

32:15.667 --> 32:17.713
I don't believe you.
You're not a murderer.

32:17.834 --> 32:19.880
You don't know shit!
I know you're not a killer.

32:20.001 --> 32:22.250
Yes, I am!
Yeah, well who have you killed?

32:22.330 --> 32:24.860
I fucking killed Meg Jackson.

32:33.293 --> 32:37.027
It was an accident, but I did it.

32:37.149 --> 32:41.563
She shat on me like Mum did.
And that's what I hang on to.

32:41.686 --> 32:44.616
When I see her dying,
I pretend it was Mum.

32:44.698 --> 32:46.663
Alright, don't say any more.

32:46.786 --> 32:49.796
You go into detail,
I'll have to report it.

33:08.950 --> 33:11.882
So, you still think
I'm a good person, do ya?

33:14.370 --> 33:17.300
I think you need to absorb
what's happened today.

33:19.835 --> 33:23.406
You've started to trust.
It's a big step.

33:27.983 --> 33:29.951
Came at a price though, hey?

34:11.351 --> 34:14.246
Oi! This is Red's cell now.

34:17.750 --> 34:19.801
This isn't even your unit.

35:08.854 --> 35:11.591
How are you feeling?
Why are you doing this?

35:11.712 --> 35:14.046
Ms Westfall tells me
that you're sticking

35:14.166 --> 35:17.707
with this story about
an intruder in the prison.

35:18.913 --> 35:22.698
Something about someone trying to
keep you from Jodie Spiteri's hearing?

35:25.150 --> 35:28.329
I'd hate to see
you leave us, Smith,

35:28.450 --> 35:30.824
but if you continue,
I will have no choice but

35:30.945 --> 35:33.721
to ask Doctor Lynch to commit you
to a psychiatric facility.

35:36.297 --> 35:39.193
Unless you want to spend
the rest of your life surrounded by

35:39.313 --> 35:43.742
the criminally insane, I would
advise you to stick with the truth.

35:47.122 --> 35:51.024
There was no attack.
It did not happen.

36:18.668 --> 36:20.237
Thanks, Michael.

36:41.201 --> 36:43.536
What are you doing?
Shut the door!

36:43.656 --> 36:48.244
Mr Fletcher.
My office. Now.

36:56.372 --> 37:00.959
I think we need to discuss
your behaviour, Mr Fletcher.

37:01.039 --> 37:02.409
Sh-sure.

37:03.254 --> 37:06.956
I expect my staff to maintain
a professional distance from the prisoners.

37:07.116 --> 37:10.698
It disappoints me when I see
officers crossing the line.

37:12.589 --> 37:14.478
You following me, Mr Fletcher?

37:16.371 --> 37:19.673
Mr Fletcher? Yes.
We don't want to give them

37:19.791 --> 37:22.408
cause for complaint now, do we?
No.

37:22.527 --> 37:26.350
And that includes not conveniently
walking into a strip search room.

37:26.432 --> 37:28.847
I'm sorry. I made a mistake.

37:30.051 --> 37:32.063
This is a verbal warning.

37:32.185 --> 37:34.198
If it happens again, I'll have
to take more serious action.

37:34.278 --> 37:36.208
Are we clear about that?

37:36.974 --> 37:39.550
Mr Fletcher,
are we clear about that?

37:40.635 --> 37:43.814
Very clear. Sorry, Governor.

37:46.147 --> 37:47.759
Go.

37:57.252 --> 37:58.542
Bloody hell, Liz.

38:03.289 --> 38:07.070
Hey. Hey. Hey, Liz. Hey.
Wake up. Hmm?

38:07.876 --> 38:13.149
Where is it? You get off my titties.
Get off my titties! Maxine!

38:13.268 --> 38:16.046
Get off me!
This brew has caused enough trouble.

38:16.167 --> 38:17.935
That's my brew.
I'm going to get rid of it. No, no!

38:18.055 --> 38:21.155
You don't need this shit.
Maxine! Is this yours?

38:21.276 --> 38:23.973
Maxine! Oh, yeah.
Give me that! Don't you take that.

38:24.053 --> 38:26.507
Don't you dare pour that out!

38:26.627 --> 38:28.518
Hey! What are you doing?
Hey! Stop that!

38:28.598 --> 38:30.773
Stopping the problem, Booms. No!

38:30.892 --> 38:34.837
If I see another bottle of this
in here again, you're fucked.

38:34.957 --> 38:38.418
She's tipped it out.
She's tipped the bloody thing out.

38:38.498 --> 38:42.441
Fuckin'... Oh, fuck's sake.

38:43.608 --> 38:45.459
Fuckin' knew it, ya slagger.

38:45.579 --> 38:51.051
Don't you start on me. You are like
a broken record. Round and...

38:51.173 --> 38:54.716
"Oh, lagger. Bloody hell,
you've stolen me brew, ya lagger.

38:54.835 --> 38:58.215
Get my hands off Franky!" I didn't
steal your friggin' brew.

38:58.336 --> 39:01.233
You've been shoving it
under my pillow. I have not...

39:01.355 --> 39:05.459
No and you have already
bashed my scone in for lagging,

39:05.578 --> 39:11.049
so we are even, right? So you can
shut up, ya fat arse baby.

39:15.961 --> 39:18.294
I don't have a fat arse.

39:19.221 --> 39:20.828
You do.

39:23.848 --> 39:27.751
And what are you starin' at,
little Miss Misery Guts?

39:59.436 --> 40:01.755
Can you save my spot? Yeah.

40:07.668 --> 40:11.063
What I told you before,
I was making shit up.

40:11.583 --> 40:14.220
Yeah. I figured that.

40:19.333 --> 40:22.488
Would you do this
for any of the women?

40:30.799 --> 40:34.433
Ms Westfall. Bea Smith
has requested to see you.

40:39.907 --> 40:43.181
Hi. You wanted to see me?
Yeah.

40:46.618 --> 40:50.335
I thought I'd tag along.
Just see how you're progressing.

40:53.690 --> 40:57.004
I've been going over things.
And you were right.

40:57.124 --> 41:01.560
The story about the intruder?
It must have been the drugs.

41:03.957 --> 41:07.073
Why do you think you
couldn't accept this before?

41:09.268 --> 41:10.747
Did you take them willingly?

41:11.747 --> 41:12.704
No.

41:13.583 --> 41:16.501
One of the other women
must have spiked my food.

41:23.052 --> 41:25.329
I'm sorry for wasting your time.

41:49.016 --> 41:53.889
'You know, I saw into her soul.
It's just black.

41:56.361 --> 41:58.041
'It's darkness.'

41:59.636 --> 42:02.353
And then I could see
into her mind.

42:05.430 --> 42:07.625
I could see the horror.

42:17.096 --> 42:20.049
I knew she was a freak,

42:20.169 --> 42:22.689
but I didn't think
she'd go this far.

42:22.769 --> 42:24.483
She's fuckin' demented.

42:29.199 --> 42:31.078
You believe me, right?

42:31.715 --> 42:34.514
Yep. Yeah, of course I do.

42:37.629 --> 42:41.143
What about this? Dunno what I'm going
to do with it yet.

42:45.181 --> 42:48.415
Heard you put on quite a show, Red.
Scaled a fence and everything.

42:48.493 --> 42:50.293
Yeah, I was drugged.

42:50.412 --> 42:54.807
While you were off your face, Jodes
was packed off to the Psych Ward.

42:54.886 --> 42:56.804
Yeah, I heard. You know,

42:56.925 --> 42:58.682
it was Ferguson who stopped me
getting to the hearing.

42:58.801 --> 43:01.077
Yeah, I worked that
out myself, thanks.

43:02.198 --> 43:04.437
Do you reckon you
could still take her on?

43:05.673 --> 43:10.306
How many poor bitches like Jodie are
gonna end up collateral damage?

43:10.426 --> 43:14.302
Huh?
Who's next? Is it you?

43:15.660 --> 43:18.018
It's not gonna be me.
OK.

43:24.048 --> 43:26.366
What are you going
to do about the Freak?

43:30.162 --> 43:31.881
I'm gonna sit tight.

43:33.396 --> 43:35.756
And I'm gonna play a long game.

44:39.353 --> 44:43.230
I'm not a good person! Yes, you are.
I fucking killed her!

44:43.348 --> 44:46.106
I don't believe you. You're not
a murderer. You don't know shit!

44:46.227 --> 44:49.302
I know you're not a killer. Yes,
I am! Oh, yeah, who have you killed?

44:49.380 --> 44:51.936
I fucking killed Meg Jackson!

44:52.305 --> 44:58.799
