-No, but none of them are Rami Shalem.

15:02.541 --> 15:05.041
So I guess I should call
the people at Paul Taylor.

15:05.125 --> 15:07.000
-They'll be expecting her, right?
-Oh.

15:07.083 --> 15:09.041
Don't bother with that. I called them.

15:09.125 --> 15:11.833
-We know a few people on the board.
-[Marcia] So I let them know.

15:11.916 --> 15:14.375
-Obviously, they were very...
-Good, good.

15:14.458 --> 15:16.958
Um, this is from me and Ella.

15:18.125 --> 15:19.916
-Thank you.
-How's she doing?

15:20.875 --> 15:22.500
[Segev] Like all of us, I guess.

15:22.583 --> 15:24.208
She sends her love.

15:24.291 --> 15:26.583
Oh, Segev, this is lovely.

15:27.333 --> 15:28.208
Beautiful.

15:28.291 --> 15:29.750
-From the wedding?
-Yeah.

15:29.833 --> 15:30.958
Thank you so much.

15:31.041 --> 15:34.000
I'm just going
to tuck it away someplace safe.

15:35.041 --> 15:37.708
Then I want to introduce you
to some of Danielle's friends.

15:37.791 --> 15:38.666
Thank you.

15:50.333 --> 15:53.041
-I heard they released the two drivers.
-Yeah.

15:54.666 --> 15:57.791
-I didn't think you'd know about it.
-I contacted the authorities.

15:57.875 --> 16:00.791
They were very sympathetic,
said they'd keep me apprised.

16:00.875 --> 16:03.291
-What authorities?
-They didn't know much.

16:03.875 --> 16:05.500
-Do you know anything?
-No.

16:06.500 --> 16:08.791
Just that they were drunk
and stole the car.

16:09.916 --> 16:11.958
I don't believe that. Do you?

16:12.583 --> 16:13.500
I don't know.

16:14.250 --> 16:16.083
-The police said--
-Mr. Wexler.

16:16.166 --> 16:18.750
Michael, so good of you to come.

16:18.833 --> 16:21.666
This is Segev, Danielle's husband.

16:21.750 --> 16:25.333
This is Michael.
He and our girl go way back,

16:25.833 --> 16:28.000
what, second, third grade, right?

16:28.083 --> 16:30.625
-So sorry for your loss.
-Thank you.

16:32.541 --> 16:35.041
[Martin] No stopping her. [chuckles]

16:35.125 --> 16:39.833
Her determination, her imagination.

16:40.416 --> 16:44.666
She saw a different life for herself...

16:47.083 --> 16:48.000
and I didn't...

16:49.708 --> 16:52.750
always agree with her choices...

16:55.375 --> 16:58.291
but I did respect them.

17:00.958 --> 17:01.833
I did.

17:02.833 --> 17:04.833
[somber music playing]

17:04.916 --> 17:05.791
And I--

17:10.458 --> 17:11.958
I hope she knew that.

17:12.458 --> 17:13.541
Um...

17:14.750 --> 17:15.916
Now, it's, uh...

17:18.541 --> 17:19.500
no secret...

17:20.625 --> 17:22.541
we weren't completely onboard

17:22.625 --> 17:26.041
with her living
6,000 miles away, in Tel Aviv.

17:26.750 --> 17:31.291
But, uh, in embracing something new,

17:31.375 --> 17:33.208
she taught us to do the same.

17:37.166 --> 17:40.375
We came to cherish our visits with her...

17:41.583 --> 17:43.708
and her wonderful husband, Segev.

17:45.250 --> 17:49.666
And those times, the memory of them,
keeps Dani with us.

17:49.750 --> 17:50.666
Always.

17:57.625 --> 17:59.625
-[Ron] That was...
-Unbearable?

18:00.375 --> 18:02.625
Weird and unbearable.

18:03.500 --> 18:06.500
The woman I was talking to
at the bar came on to me.

18:06.583 --> 18:07.416
What?

18:07.916 --> 18:09.458
Guess she liked them young.

18:09.541 --> 18:10.541
She was old?

18:10.625 --> 18:15.125
I heard about stuff like this happening
in weddings and stuff but a funeral, man?

18:15.208 --> 18:16.416
This is America.

18:17.083 --> 18:18.166
Unbelievable.

18:20.416 --> 18:23.041
-[jazz music playing over speakers]
-[door unlocks]

18:27.291 --> 18:30.041
[groans]

18:31.166 --> 18:33.583
-Sorry I'm so late. [scoffs]
-You're not late.

18:34.125 --> 18:35.666
Oh, yeah, I guess you are.

18:36.708 --> 18:40.000
Judge Emmitt held us hostage
for three hours,

18:40.083 --> 18:42.916
at the end of which,
I had to file a continuance.

18:44.125 --> 18:44.958
Sushi?

18:45.041 --> 18:47.875
Mixing it up, keeping the magic alive.

18:48.458 --> 18:50.791
-You didn't feel like Indian, huh?
-Not really.

18:53.416 --> 18:55.916
What are you working on,
the Gates profile?

18:56.416 --> 18:58.375
I saw an old acquaintance today.

18:59.708 --> 19:01.708
Oh, fuck me. [sniffs]

19:02.541 --> 19:03.500
This wasabi...

19:04.125 --> 19:05.416
Segev Azulai.

19:06.583 --> 19:08.125
I know that name, don't I?

19:08.208 --> 19:11.541
You met him when he was in New York once,
seven or eight years ago.

19:11.625 --> 19:13.541
I knew him when I lived in Cartagena.

19:14.291 --> 19:15.875
-The Israeli guy?
-Mm-hm.

19:18.666 --> 19:20.791
A bit more than an acquaintance,
wasn't he?

19:21.291 --> 19:22.916
-Henry...
-I'm just saying.

19:25.041 --> 19:26.750
What's he doing in New York?

19:26.833 --> 19:28.000
His wife died.

19:28.083 --> 19:29.291
[Henry] Ugh. Wow.

19:30.208 --> 19:32.708
That's... terrible.

19:32.791 --> 19:33.708
How's he doing?

19:34.416 --> 19:36.166
I don't know. Okay, I guess.

19:36.666 --> 19:39.000
He wanted me
to help him track some information.

19:39.541 --> 19:40.458
Information?

19:40.541 --> 19:44.416
Seemed her death was an accident at first,
but he thinks there's more to the story.

19:44.500 --> 19:45.375
Really?

19:46.125 --> 19:47.791
And he's not making it up?

19:49.916 --> 19:52.000
Of course not. Who would do that?

19:53.041 --> 19:56.000
I don't know, just seems a little weird.

19:56.583 --> 19:57.958
Why not just go to the police?

19:59.166 --> 20:00.125
I don't know.

20:01.583 --> 20:03.083
I don't have the time for him anyway.

20:05.375 --> 20:08.666
How's work? Did they get back
to you on the story idea?

20:09.541 --> 20:11.250
Yeah. Peter didn't go for it.

20:12.000 --> 20:15.083
Never fucking does.
I don't know what the problem is.

20:15.166 --> 20:17.958
I'm gonna be doing political profiles
for the rest of my life.

20:18.041 --> 20:19.541
'Cause you're so good at them.

20:21.666 --> 20:24.375
-I'm good at everything I do.
-Ooh, I know.

20:28.250 --> 20:29.541
Sushi's getting cold.

20:30.125 --> 20:31.000
Let it.

20:32.416 --> 20:33.583
[chuckles]

20:33.666 --> 20:36.583
You'll get it, Ellush.
You just need to practice.

20:37.083 --> 20:38.291
Did Tali come today?

20:38.958 --> 20:41.458
Yes, Dad. She has to come every day
until you come home.

20:41.541 --> 20:42.541
[Syd] Hey, Segev.

20:43.291 --> 20:45.291
She doesn't have to, she wants to.

20:45.375 --> 20:47.000
[Ella] Mostly she talks to the policemen.

20:47.708 --> 20:49.250
So they were there too?

20:49.333 --> 20:52.291
They have to be here every day
until you come home.

20:53.916 --> 20:55.416
When are you coming back?

20:56.875 --> 20:58.000
In a little while.

20:58.625 --> 20:59.750
Not too long.

21:00.958 --> 21:02.125
Well, I miss you.

21:04.541 --> 21:05.541
I miss you too.

21:06.166 --> 21:08.416
But I gotta go get dressed for school.

21:10.500 --> 21:14.208
I told Shira
that I'd take her to school today.

21:16.625 --> 21:18.291
How are you doing, Segev?

21:19.333 --> 21:21.083
I went to the memorial today,

21:21.166 --> 21:24.291
all these people I didn't know
talking about Danielle. It was...

21:24.375 --> 21:25.916
That must have been rough.

21:26.000 --> 21:27.791
[dramatic music playing]

21:27.875 --> 21:29.291
So when are you coming home?

21:30.750 --> 21:31.750
I don't know.

22:05.208 --> 22:06.500
[door buzzer buzzing]

22:07.041 --> 22:08.000
[knocking on door]

22:12.250 --> 22:14.125
-Naomi.
-[Naomi] Ron.

22:14.208 --> 22:15.458
[both laugh]

22:15.541 --> 22:18.041
-Love the apron.
-Come on in. Come-- Oh.

22:18.666 --> 22:21.500
-It's good to see you.
-You too.

22:24.541 --> 22:27.250
It's good to see
that some things never change.

22:27.333 --> 22:29.291
Except maybe that you're cooking?

22:29.375 --> 22:30.458
I'm not cooking.

22:31.333 --> 22:32.958
How is it that I knew that?

22:35.250 --> 22:37.875
So? I thought you weren't gonna help.

22:38.458 --> 22:41.291
Fuck you, Ron.
When have I ever not helped?

22:41.375 --> 22:42.750
Gorgeous as ever, huh?

22:42.833 --> 22:43.916
Segev!

22:44.000 --> 22:46.500
-What's he trying to do?
-What do you mean?

22:46.583 --> 22:49.000
Going after this Isaac guy.

22:56.000 --> 22:58.958
Segev, what are you thinking?
Isaac Katkov?

22:59.041 --> 23:02.000
-This dude's mobbed up bigtime.
-Did you find him?

23:03.583 --> 23:07.625
He owns a bar and a bowling alley,
the only legit thing I could find.

23:08.791 --> 23:10.166
So you didn't find him.

23:10.958 --> 23:12.833
Yeah, and I'm glad I didn't.

23:12.916 --> 23:16.416
I wasn't expecting a Boy Scout,
but this is one very dangerous guy.

23:16.500 --> 23:19.000
I know. I worked for him.

23:19.083 --> 23:22.166
[Naomi] This guy's been trafficking
in arms for years.

23:22.250 --> 23:25.958
He's connected to syndicates
in Israel, Lebanon, Morocco.

23:26.041 --> 23:29.750
-Read the article I found in Haaretz.
-I'm reading it now.

23:29.833 --> 23:31.916
Good. Maybe you can knock
some sense into him.

23:32.000 --> 23:33.916
He killed my wife.

23:36.083 --> 23:37.541
I know you think that.

23:38.041 --> 23:39.541
And maybe you're right.

23:39.625 --> 23:43.500
And it's truly horrible,
but you're not in special forces anymore.

23:43.583 --> 23:47.583
You don't have some camouflage team
of 40 guys backing you up.

23:47.666 --> 23:48.666
He has me.

23:50.666 --> 23:53.375
Exactly. You have your best friend,

23:53.458 --> 23:54.833
who's wearing an apron.

23:56.291 --> 23:59.708
If he's coming after me
and after my family,

24:00.666 --> 24:01.958
I have to find him.

24:11.833 --> 24:12.875
[door opens]

24:14.166 --> 24:15.208
[door closes]

24:16.625 --> 24:18.250
I think you better go after her.

24:21.833 --> 24:25.125
-Naomi. Hey, stop.
-I have to get to a meeting.

24:26.458 --> 24:29.083
-I shouldn't have brought you into this.
-I'm not in this.

24:29.166 --> 24:31.041
I want nothing to do with this.

24:31.125 --> 24:33.666
You're never gonna change. I know you.

24:33.750 --> 24:36.916
I've seen you beat the shit out of someone
for saying the wrong thing.

24:37.958 --> 24:40.750
I know what you're capable of
and it scares me.

24:41.375 --> 24:43.833
I'm not going to do anything crazy.

24:44.958 --> 24:46.416
Still a bad liar.

24:54.583 --> 24:55.416
[door closes]

24:57.625 --> 24:58.583
[Ron] Segev.

24:59.583 --> 25:01.291
-[Segev] Huh?
-Come here for a sec.

25:02.208 --> 25:03.041
Sit.

25:04.250 --> 25:05.125
[Segev] What?

25:05.833 --> 25:08.041
I think Naomi was on to something.

25:08.125 --> 25:10.375
Turns out, your friend Isaac has a bar.

25:10.458 --> 25:13.833
It's a gay sports bar
in some bowling alley.

25:13.916 --> 25:17.500
And he seems to be very close
with this guy Benny.

25:18.125 --> 25:19.041
Benny?

25:19.708 --> 25:22.875
And Benny's really into posting
on Instagram.

25:23.708 --> 25:26.708
So I put in a follow request,
and guess what? He accepted.

25:26.791 --> 25:28.166
In less than five minutes.

25:28.250 --> 25:29.708
Easy as that.

25:30.541 --> 25:33.333
He doesn't even know me. [laughs]

25:33.416 --> 25:37.416
His favorite thing to post
are a ton of pictures...

25:38.416 --> 25:41.291
of him with Isaac at the bar, naturally.

25:44.125 --> 25:45.791
Benny, Benny, Benny.

25:46.750 --> 25:49.291
Don't you know
social media is not your friend?

25:49.375 --> 25:51.375
[dramatic music playing]

25:59.708 --> 26:02.166
Take what you want.
I'll get the key to the van.

26:03.000 --> 26:04.000
[Segev] Wow.

26:15.250 --> 26:17.125
[disco music playing over speakers]

26:24.791 --> 26:27.458
It seems that Benny's really living it
on the edge.

26:29.000 --> 26:30.500
Not sure Isaac would like it.

26:33.291 --> 26:36.625
[Segev] I don't think Isaac's gonna
show up. Let's get out of here.

26:38.083 --> 26:39.083
We could leave.

26:39.833 --> 26:42.166
Or we could stick around
and chat with Benny.

26:47.625 --> 26:48.916
You're Benny, right?

26:51.875 --> 26:53.666
I've seen you here before.

26:53.750 --> 26:56.791
What is this,
Dip a Toe in the Water night?

26:57.541 --> 27:00.125
It's gay league. You're not gay.

27:00.750 --> 27:03.958
Right, but, actually,
I'm asking for my friend here.

27:04.541 --> 27:07.333
He wants to bowl with you, but he's shy.

27:12.291 --> 27:14.250
-He's not gay either.
-Thank you.

27:14.333 --> 27:16.666
Would you please tell him that?
'Cause I've tried.

27:18.583 --> 27:20.083
He'll need shoes.

27:22.000 --> 27:23.041
What size?

27:23.125 --> 27:23.958
Ten.

27:25.458 --> 27:26.875
Let me look in the back.

27:33.833 --> 27:35.833
[ominous music playing]

27:42.833 --> 27:45.875
[Benny] Fuck you.
You're making a big mistake.

27:46.583 --> 27:49.083
[Segev] This is Isaac's club?
It's a piece of shit.

27:49.666 --> 27:51.083
Isaac's gonna kill you.

27:52.166 --> 27:53.833
And you may as well kill me.

27:53.916 --> 27:54.791
Kill you?

27:55.458 --> 27:59.250
You're our man on the inside. None of this
would be possible without you.

28:03.125 --> 28:04.125
[Segev] Get out, Benny.

28:11.041 --> 28:12.166

[techno music playing over speakers]

29:04.958 --> 29:06.208
[Ron] What's up, Isaac?

29:07.416 --> 29:09.125
It's been a while, huh?

29:13.083 --> 29:15.083
[ominous music playing]

29:17.541 --> 29:19.541
What the fuck are you doing here, Segev?

29:21.833 --> 29:25.375
You're not gonna hurt me
or any member of my family, you heard me?

29:27.791 --> 29:30.083
What the hell are you talking about?

29:31.375 --> 29:33.250
The two men who killed my wife?

29:33.791 --> 29:35.375
The bomb at my house in Israel?

29:36.000 --> 29:39.250
Fuck, if I wanted,
I could have killed you years ago.

29:40.458 --> 29:42.208
You telling me
it's a coincidence Mark Posner

29:42.291 --> 29:44.166
and David Chernik are here in New York?

29:46.000 --> 29:49.791
Yeah. I hired them
for a job in Israel, some woman.

29:51.958 --> 29:54.416
The hell are you saying,
that was your wife?

29:54.500 --> 29:56.750
Don't act like you didn't know
it was my wife!

29:59.583 --> 30:01.125
No, no, I knew nothing.

30:05.583 --> 30:07.250
And I didn't kill her, okay?

30:07.333 --> 30:10.916
I don't kill at all, I--
I make arrangements.

30:11.000 --> 30:13.750
Someone else wanted her dead,
and now, fuck...

30:14.791 --> 30:17.166
they want you to think I did it.

30:17.708 --> 30:19.291
Someone's setting me up.

30:21.416 --> 30:24.333
-Someone's setting me up.
-So who paid for it?

30:29.166 --> 30:30.333
I have no idea.

30:33.625 --> 30:36.625
-Who hired you?
-I don't know. I never know.

30:36.708 --> 30:40.416
People call, I don't want to know
who they are, who the mark is.

30:40.500 --> 30:42.250
One party wants to get something done,

30:42.333 --> 30:44.500
I put them together with people
who can do it, that's it.

30:44.583 --> 30:46.708
I'm the fucking middleman.
No questions asked.

30:46.791 --> 30:49.625
-You didn't know it was my wife?
-If I knew that bitch was your wife,

30:49.708 --> 30:53.083
I would've made them kill her
in front of you and made you watch.

30:53.625 --> 30:54.875
-Yeah?
-Yeah!

30:57.708 --> 30:59.875
You want to make me watch?
You want me to watch?

30:59.958 --> 31:02.375
Segev. Segev! Segev!

31:02.458 --> 31:05.625
You're gonna kill him.
Segev, let go. Segev!

31:12.250 --> 31:15.166
So who the hell was your wife, Segev, huh?

31:16.791 --> 31:20.333
That somebody wanted her dead
and wants to hang it all on me?

31:22.166 --> 31:25.333
Isaac, you hired the drivers,

31:25.875 --> 31:28.500
you bring them here now, okay?

31:30.458 --> 31:32.083
[techno music playing over speakers]

31:40.458 --> 31:42.125
[Ron] Where the fuck are they, Isaac?

32:17.208 --> 32:18.833
Hey, Isaac!

33:48.750 --> 33:49.958
Fuck!

33:50.041 --> 33:52.250
Fuck, man! Fuck, fuck!

33:53.125 --> 33:54.458
Man! Fuck!

33:54.541 --> 33:57.250
-Did you kill Danielle Azulai?
-Fuck you! Fuck!

33:58.166 --> 34:01.833
-Did you meet the client?
-Fuck you, man! I didn't kill nobody!

34:01.916 --> 34:04.708
-Did you meet the client?
-I don't know, man, I'm telling you.

34:05.208 --> 34:08.333
We got an envelope
with an address and some photos!

34:08.416 --> 34:11.250
Who was the fucking client? Who was it?

34:11.750 --> 34:13.375
-Fuck you!
-Who was he?

34:13.916 --> 34:17.500
He's a fucking cheap bastard, man,
that's who!

34:17.583 --> 34:19.458
A lousy 20 grand!

Ron? Ron, come help me out!

34:57.458 --> 34:59.416
Ron, come help me!

35:01.625 --> 35:03.416
Ron, what the fuck?

35:06.708 --> 35:07.541
Ron?

35:10.916 --> 35:13.000
Ron, what's going on? What's wrong?

35:13.083 --> 35:15.208
Move over, I'll drive.
Move! Come on, move!

35:15.750 --> 35:17.958
Come on. Get your leg away.

35:18.041 --> 35:19.500
[engine starts]

35:24.458 --> 35:25.791
Ron?

35:25.875 --> 35:27.833
Ron, hey, hey. You're okay?

35:27.916 --> 35:28.750
Tell me.

35:29.333 --> 35:31.125
Ron, come on. You okay?

35:31.625 --> 35:32.458
Ron!

35:44.750 --> 35:47.166
-Get them out! Out of the car!
-What's wrong?

35:47.250 --> 35:50.958
It's all bloody now! How am I supposed
to drive my kid to school?

35:51.041 --> 35:52.833
Relax. All good, all good.

35:52.916 --> 35:55.583
Relax. Look at me. Breathe.

35:55.666 --> 35:58.416
Breathe. Breathe. Are you breathing?

35:58.500 --> 35:59.916
All good. I'm here, brother.

36:00.500 --> 36:02.500
I'm here. All good.

36:03.666 --> 36:04.500
Take.

36:05.583 --> 36:07.041
I'm here, brother.

36:08.416 --> 36:09.541
I'm taking care of it.

36:09.625 --> 36:11.208
All good. Look at me.

36:11.291 --> 36:13.500
Relax. I'm gonna take care of it.

36:22.333 --> 36:24.500
-Is he okay?
-Yeah.

36:25.250 --> 36:28.166
Henry's out of town for the night.
He has an arraignment in D.C.

36:28.250 --> 36:32.291
-Thank you. We didn't wanna wake you up--
-Stop. I don't want to hear anything.

36:32.375 --> 36:35.708
-Things got a little, you know--
-What? A little crazy?

36:35.791 --> 36:37.791
The kind of crazy I was afraid of?

36:39.875 --> 36:42.416
I don't want to know anything, Segev.

36:43.291 --> 36:44.208
Nothing.

36:47.125 --> 36:48.958
You have until tomorrow.

36:49.041 --> 36:49.875
Thank you.

Hey, man. You're okay?

36:57.916 --> 36:58.958
You need water?

36:59.500 --> 37:01.625
Hey. You're fine.

[cell phone ringing]

37:37.625 --> 37:38.500
Ellush.

37:38.583 --> 37:41.416
Called you a bunch of times.
Where were you?

37:41.500 --> 37:44.791
Yeah, me and Ron, we got out,
I forgot my phone. What's wrong?

37:44.875 --> 37:46.666
I just want you to come back.

37:46.750 --> 37:47.583
Soon, baby.

37:47.666 --> 37:49.833
There's just a few things
I got to sort out.

37:50.458 --> 37:52.333
I really miss Dani, Abba.

37:56.375 --> 37:58.375
-I know.
-[Shira] Ella? We have to go.

37:58.458 --> 37:59.458
I miss her as well.

38:00.083 --> 38:02.291
Dad, I gotta go now. Mom's calling me.

-What?

40:03.708 --> 40:04.916
The TV doesn't work.

40:10.916 --> 40:12.375
Where are the Wexlers?

40:12.458 --> 40:14.541
Mom, the super's here!

40:15.125 --> 40:17.541
No offense but Airbnbs suck.

40:20.625 --> 40:22.416
-Airbnb?
-Mom!

40:23.083 --> 40:24.958
[woman] I am so sorry.

40:25.041 --> 40:27.291
I didn't mean for you to come this early.

40:27.375 --> 40:28.916
Where are the Wexlers?

40:29.000 --> 40:32.416
The Wexlers? I don't know any Wexlers.

40:32.500 --> 40:35.583
I only called about the TV not working.
You're the super, right?

40:35.666 --> 40:36.958
How long you been here?

40:37.750 --> 40:40.958
-It might be best if you just come back--
-How long have you been here?

40:41.625 --> 40:44.708
We were told we couldn't get in
until 7:30 last night, so...

40:50.666 --> 40:51.541
I'm sorry.
