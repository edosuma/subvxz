<i>It's a jungle out there</i>

00:32.225 --> 00:35.126
<i>Disorder and confusion
everywhere</i>

00:36.730 --> 00:38.961
<i>No one seems to care</i>

00:39.033 --> 00:40.091
<i>Well, I do</i>

00:40.167 --> 00:43.034
<i>Hey, who's in charge here?</i>

00:43.104 --> 00:45.004
<i>It's a jungle out there</i>

00:46.874 --> 00:49.342
<i>Poison in the very air
we breathe</i>

00:50.011 --> 00:52.479
<i>You know what's in the water
that you drink?</i>

00:52.546 --> 00:53.536
<i>Well, I do</i>

00:53.615 --> 00:56.345
<i>It's amazing</i>

00:56.952 --> 00:58.510
<i>People think I'm crazy</i>

00:58.587 --> 01:00.214
<i>'cause I worry
all the time</i>

01:00.289 --> 01:02.655
<i>If you paid attention,
you'd be worried, too</i>

01:03.458 --> 01:04.822
<i>You better pay attention</i>

01:04.893 --> 01:07.328
<i>Or this world
we love so much</i>

01:07.697 --> 01:10.860
<i>might just kill you</i>

01:11.534 --> 01:13.525
<i>I could be wrong now</i>

01:13.870 --> 01:15.599
<i>But I don't think so</i>

01:15.672 --> 01:17.799
<i>'Cause there's
a jungle out there</i>

01:18.374 --> 01:20.501
<i>It's a jungle out there</i>

01:37.496 --> 01:39.760
Excuse me. Miss?

01:40.766 --> 01:41.824
Where you want it?

01:41.901 --> 01:43.368
Talk to him.

01:43.636 --> 01:44.625
Oh, finally.

01:44.704 --> 01:45.728
Hey, sport,
where am I going?

01:45.805 --> 01:48.467
Well, it's a refrigerator.
Let's try the kitchen.

01:48.541 --> 01:50.236
Yeah, all right.
I was just asking.

01:52.546 --> 01:53.774
That's another step.

01:53.847 --> 01:55.337
Where?
Right there.

01:56.717 --> 01:59.049
What, that? What are you talking about?

01:59.119 --> 02:00.711
Yeah, it's gonna
cost you.

02:00.787 --> 02:01.845
Cost me what?

02:01.922 --> 02:04.686
Money. Forty bucks.
It's in the contract.

02:04.825 --> 02:06.521
What?
Page four.

02:06.694 --> 02:08.854
"Any change in elevation
in said residence

02:08.930 --> 02:11.694
"or place of business
shall constitute a stairway.

02:11.766 --> 02:13.563
"Additional delivery
fees may apply. "

02:13.634 --> 02:16.034
That's ridiculous. It's
not a step. It's a lip.

02:16.137 --> 02:18.105
It's not even a lip.
It's a demi-lip.

02:18.172 --> 02:19.799
It's a step.

02:20.008 --> 02:21.670
You want this
refrigerator or not?

02:22.678 --> 02:23.667
Yeah.

02:25.748 --> 02:27.443
Forty bucks.

02:28.117 --> 02:29.345
For the step.

02:36.559 --> 02:37.548
Excuse me.

02:41.164 --> 02:44.031
Natalie, he wants
40 more dollars.

02:44.167 --> 02:45.600
What for?

02:45.735 --> 02:47.134
The floor is uneven.

02:47.237 --> 02:48.829
Well, that's ridiculous.
It's just a lip.

02:48.938 --> 02:51.305
That's what I said,
exactly, verbatim.

02:51.375 --> 02:52.842
Tell him no.

02:53.411 --> 02:55.208
He's doing
the stare-down.

02:55.279 --> 02:57.941
Then stare back. Mr.
Monk, he's testing you.

02:58.015 --> 03:00.210
Just look him
in the eye and say no.

03:00.284 --> 03:03.685
I don't think I can. I've never
won a stare-down in my life.

03:03.754 --> 03:05.450
I'm 0 for five.

03:05.524 --> 03:07.719
Mr. Monk, this is
your house, isn't it?

03:07.793 --> 03:10.489
You can't let someone stare
you down in your own house.

03:10.662 --> 03:13.358
It's my house.
You're absolutely right.

03:20.106 --> 03:21.130
What's it gonna be?

03:21.207 --> 03:22.333
Okay, $40.

03:25.044 --> 03:27.069
Plus 120
for the delivery.

03:27.980 --> 03:29.504
Just a second.

03:29.849 --> 03:30.838
Mmm-hmm.

03:32.085 --> 03:33.177
Plus gratuity.

03:33.252 --> 03:34.481
Okay.

03:38.692 --> 03:40.819
Okay, there you go.
Thank you very much.

03:44.364 --> 03:45.353
Hello.

03:47.000 --> 03:48.160
Yes.

03:48.870 --> 03:50.360
Okay, I understand.

03:50.839 --> 03:52.397
We'll be right down.

03:54.375 --> 03:55.899
You okay?
Who was that?

03:55.977 --> 03:58.741
It's the FBI. They want
to ask you some questions.

04:01.282 --> 04:03.443
First off, I'd like to
thank Captain Stottlemeyer

04:03.518 --> 04:04.679
for letting us
meet here this morning.

04:04.753 --> 04:07.620
When we're in LA, of course, we'll
be working out of my field office.

04:07.690 --> 04:08.679
Who's going to LA?

04:08.757 --> 04:10.315
Mr. Monk is, I hope.

04:10.392 --> 04:12.952
I work for a division in
the Bureau called Team Alpha.

04:13.095 --> 04:14.960
It's our job
to identify and track

04:15.030 --> 04:17.430
high-profile targets,
dangerous individuals.

04:17.500 --> 04:20.368
For the last four months, we've been
following a man named Frank DePalma.

04:20.504 --> 04:21.732
He's a contract killer
and assassin.

04:21.805 --> 04:23.204
He's probably
the best in the world.

04:23.273 --> 04:24.297
I've never heard of him.

04:24.374 --> 04:26.808
Well, he's worked very hard to
make sure you haven't heard of him.

04:26.943 --> 04:28.103
He's linked
to 17 murders.

04:28.178 --> 04:29.941
Ten of them here, five
in Europe, two in Asia,

04:30.013 --> 04:31.503
and we've never been
able to prove a thing.

04:31.581 --> 04:33.709
There's just
no evidence at all.

04:34.752 --> 04:36.811
I'm sorry. What does
this have to do with me?

04:36.888 --> 04:39.220
Mr. DePalma arrived in Los
Angeles yesterday morning.

04:39.290 --> 04:42.487
And at 4:35 p. m. He stepped
off a curb on Wilshire Boulevard

04:42.560 --> 04:44.994
and was hit by a bus.
He was killed instantly.

04:45.062 --> 04:47.121
I'm sorry. What does this
have to do with me?

04:47.498 --> 04:49.990
Here's a picture
of Frank DePalma.

04:50.802 --> 04:52.235
Oh, my God!

04:52.538 --> 04:53.732
Jeez Louise,
look at that.

04:53.805 --> 04:55.067
Sweet.

04:55.140 --> 04:57.040
I'm sorry. What does
this have to do with me?

04:57.142 --> 04:58.541
Mr. Monk,
look at him.

04:58.610 --> 04:59.941
He's your twin!

05:00.078 --> 05:01.306
Really?
Yeah.

05:01.380 --> 05:02.369
I don't see it.

05:02.447 --> 05:03.437
Well...

05:05.485 --> 05:06.884
Oh, my God.

05:07.654 --> 05:08.678
It's me.

05:08.755 --> 05:11.246
That's your doppelganger.
They say everybody's got one.

05:11.324 --> 05:12.552
Who says that?

05:12.959 --> 05:14.859
People.
And their doppelgangers.

05:14.961 --> 05:16.952
Fortunately, we were there
when the accident occurred.

05:17.030 --> 05:19.124
So we kept a lid on it.
We kept the press out.

05:19.200 --> 05:21.065
The death certificate
says "John Doe. "

05:21.135 --> 05:22.762
So officially,
it never happened.

05:22.836 --> 05:24.565
I think I see
where this is going.

05:24.638 --> 05:26.128
Yeah, me, too.
No, you don't.

05:26.507 --> 05:29.340
We'd like to find out who hired
this man and who his target is.

05:29.443 --> 05:32.071
Mr. Monk, Adrian,
the FBI would like you

05:32.146 --> 05:34.809
to go to Los Angeles and
take Frank DePalma's place,

05:34.883 --> 05:36.851
just for a day,
two at the most.

05:36.952 --> 05:40.012
You want Mr. Monk to go
undercover as a hit man?

05:40.088 --> 05:43.023
We'll have a wire on you. We'll
never be more than 20 yards away.

05:43.091 --> 05:46.322
Okay, thank you very much.
We're gonna pass.

05:46.728 --> 05:48.094
Why don't we let Adrian
decide for himself?

05:48.164 --> 05:50.155
That's not how it works
around here. Meeting's over.

05:50.233 --> 05:51.791
Come on, Monk,
I'll walk you out.

05:52.101 --> 05:54.968
Actually, there's another reason
you might want to reconsider.

05:55.471 --> 05:57.598
Frank DePalma came to Los
Angeles to kill somebody.

05:57.673 --> 06:00.164
We don't know who hired him.
We don't know who the target is.

06:00.243 --> 06:02.769
If you don't help us, they're
gonna find somebody else.

06:03.880 --> 06:05.973
There's a life at stake
here, Mr. Monk.

06:20.398 --> 06:22.298
You were born and raised...
829 Chambers Street,

06:22.367 --> 06:25.165
Allston, Massachusetts.
Parents, Joseph and Helen.

06:25.236 --> 06:27.830
He was a professional gambler.
Died when I was 14.

06:28.039 --> 06:29.028
Your first arrest?

06:29.107 --> 06:32.441
October 22, 1997.
Assault and battery.

06:32.511 --> 06:34.069
I did two and a half years
at Joliet.

06:34.146 --> 06:36.671
And my cellmate's name was
Barry "The Maggot" Franklin.

06:36.749 --> 06:37.773
First contract kill?

06:37.850 --> 06:40.717
November 13, 1999,
Key West.

06:40.853 --> 06:44.084
Real estate billionaire, Donnie
Hernandez. I blew up his yacht.

06:44.323 --> 06:45.813
Made it look like
a fuel leak.

06:46.693 --> 06:49.127
Well, that was very
impressive, Mr. Monk.

06:49.896 --> 06:51.488
Or should I say
Mr. DePalma?

06:52.165 --> 06:53.894
All right, we better
get you dressed.

06:53.967 --> 06:55.491
Your friends are
meeting us downstairs.

06:55.568 --> 06:57.502
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
You mean now?

06:57.604 --> 06:59.595
Yeah, we're already late. Somebody's
been calling your hotel room

06:59.673 --> 07:02.199
looking for you. Wait, wait,
no, no, no. I can't go now.

07:02.276 --> 07:03.504
I'm not ready.
I just started.

07:03.577 --> 07:05.602
You're gonna be fine. You've
got the whole file memorized.

07:06.580 --> 07:07.945
I just forgot it.

07:08.316 --> 07:09.340
Forgot what?

07:09.417 --> 07:11.851
Everything about the guy.
It's a blank.

07:14.188 --> 07:17.590
Hold on. Okay, I got it
back. Wait, it's gone again.

07:18.327 --> 07:19.453
Okay, it's back.

07:19.528 --> 07:23.692
Adrian, look, I've run
dozens of agents undercover.

07:23.765 --> 07:26.233
At the end of the day,
it's all about attitude.

07:26.535 --> 07:28.025
Attitude.
You gotta sell it.

07:28.103 --> 07:30.230
You gotta believe
that you're Frankie DePalma.

07:30.405 --> 07:31.566
Right, you walk
through a door,

07:31.641 --> 07:33.632
you don't just walk
through it. You stride.

07:33.743 --> 07:35.370
You swagger.

07:35.545 --> 07:38.139
You're at the table,
you own the table.

07:38.715 --> 07:42.276
Okay, you are the toughest son of a
bitch in the room, and everybody knows it.

07:42.352 --> 07:44.479
Like the refrigerator
delivery man.

07:45.622 --> 07:46.850
Right.

07:47.491 --> 07:51.291
Okay, from this moment on,
Adrian Monk, he doesn't exist.

07:51.595 --> 07:52.755
Right.

07:53.163 --> 07:55.028
You're Frankie DePalma.

07:55.165 --> 07:56.723
You're a killing machine.

07:56.800 --> 07:58.495
Yeah, that's it.

09:08.644 --> 09:10.202
Welcome back,
Mr. DePalma.

09:34.505 --> 09:35.904
I'd like to meet him.

09:36.073 --> 09:38.337
Who's that? My twin, my doppelganger.

09:39.109 --> 09:40.701
I wonder
if I could take him.

09:40.878 --> 09:42.345
You mean, like,
in a fight?

09:42.413 --> 09:44.143
Yeah, I bet
I could take him.

09:44.983 --> 09:47.076
Man versus
doppelganger.

09:48.420 --> 09:50.820
<i>Team Alpha to base.
I am approaching the room.</i>

09:55.961 --> 09:57.895
Okay, I'm in the room.

09:59.565 --> 10:01.692
I'm looking around the room.

10:04.036 --> 10:05.833
On my right is a wet bar

10:06.072 --> 10:10.600
<i>with two bottles of vodka, two bottles
of scotch and assorted other liquors.</i>

10:10.710 --> 10:14.807
Above the wet bar is some
type of blackboard. No chalk.

10:16.817 --> 10:20.446
There are two bowls of fruit.
One real, one plastic.

10:21.154 --> 10:22.416
<i>Both contain grapes.</i>

10:22.489 --> 10:24.719
Is he gonna tell us everything
he's doing? Apparently.

10:24.791 --> 10:27.487
I'm ascending
three steps.

10:28.096 --> 10:32.465
On the upper platform,
has an 8-by-3-foot hot tub.

10:32.834 --> 10:34.392
It's steaming.

10:35.703 --> 10:37.466
Smells heavily chlorinated.

10:39.641 --> 10:42.611
On the hot tub are
six, repeat six,

10:43.045 --> 10:45.843
white, rolled-up
terrycloth towels.

10:46.315 --> 10:48.112
<i>Possibly Egyptian cotton.</i>

10:48.484 --> 10:52.318
<i>On the south wall is a
thermostat set to 75 degrees.</i>

10:52.421 --> 10:54.446
I'm descending the stairs.

10:59.029 --> 11:00.997
There's a standing lamp
on my right

11:01.064 --> 11:03.055
in front of a gray couch
with four cushions.

11:03.133 --> 11:06.000
Two gray, two orange. I'm
touching the standing lamp.

11:09.406 --> 11:11.135
Still touching the lamp.

11:12.510 --> 11:13.943
<i>Still touching.</i>

11:14.011 --> 11:15.911
Can't stop touching
the lamp.

11:16.280 --> 11:17.713
What's wrong with me?

11:19.684 --> 11:22.152
There's a suitcase
on the ottoman.

11:22.853 --> 11:25.686
I am opening
the suitcase.

11:26.959 --> 11:29.427
The suitcase is open.

11:30.162 --> 11:31.151
<i>Wait a minute.</i>

11:31.229 --> 11:33.823
It's wider on the outside
than it is on the inside.

11:33.899 --> 11:35.764
There must be a hidden...

11:36.134 --> 11:39.262
Hidden compartment.

11:42.508 --> 11:44.237
There's someone at the door.

11:47.180 --> 11:49.114
I am walking
toward the door.

11:52.018 --> 11:53.144
Hello?

11:53.486 --> 11:54.885
It's Lola.

11:55.154 --> 11:56.314
Lola who?

11:56.857 --> 11:58.757
That's not funny, Frankie.
Open the door.

11:59.326 --> 12:00.554
Okay.

12:04.198 --> 12:06.098
How many Lola's
do you know?

12:06.166 --> 12:08.498
How many other Lola's
do you need to know?

12:10.371 --> 12:13.136
Wow, you look
really nice, Frankie.

12:13.208 --> 12:14.197
Thank you.

12:15.276 --> 12:19.076
At this point, most men would
be commenting on how I look,

12:19.147 --> 12:20.341
but that's cool.

12:20.415 --> 12:21.473
You're not most men.

12:21.549 --> 12:23.608
You're definitely
one of a kind.

12:23.718 --> 12:24.878
Not quite.

12:25.286 --> 12:27.482
Are you feeling okay?
You sound funny.

12:27.556 --> 12:28.614
I'm okay.

12:30.226 --> 12:33.627
Oh, my God, look at your
view. This is beautiful.

12:34.296 --> 12:37.356
Wow. This is way
nicer than mine.

12:37.700 --> 12:39.224
I'm in 1801.

12:40.403 --> 12:42.031
In case
you were wondering.

12:46.843 --> 12:50.939
All right, you're still mad about
Barcelona, and I don't blame you.

12:51.014 --> 12:53.949
But, Frankie, I'm trying
to make it up to you.

12:54.685 --> 12:56.313
I mean, I got you
this job, didn't I?

12:56.387 --> 12:58.981
I mean, you're making,
like, 80 grand in two days.

13:00.958 --> 13:05.190
I mean, I figure
you and I are even.

13:11.236 --> 13:12.294
Maybe not.

13:13.472 --> 13:14.461
Room service.

13:15.207 --> 13:17.038
I didn't order
room service.

13:18.844 --> 13:20.004
Actually...

13:22.147 --> 13:23.705
I took the liberty.

13:28.388 --> 13:30.356
Hello. Come on in.

13:32.826 --> 13:34.020
Champagne.

13:35.628 --> 13:38.961
It's on the house,
compliments of Jimmy Barlowe.

13:40.334 --> 13:43.792
Oh, well, be sure to thank
Jimmy Barlowe for me.

13:43.871 --> 13:44.895
Mmm.

13:46.307 --> 13:47.296
Thank you.

13:56.818 --> 13:58.251
Is there a problem,
Mr. DePalma?

13:58.320 --> 13:59.514
No.

13:59.621 --> 14:02.749
It's just, yesterday,
you seemed more appreciative.

14:03.358 --> 14:04.723
How appreciative was I?

14:04.793 --> 14:06.454
$20.

14:07.028 --> 14:08.154
For what?

14:09.064 --> 14:11.260
Fine. Fine.

14:11.501 --> 14:14.095
Okay, here is 20.

14:16.239 --> 14:17.228
Uh...

14:18.040 --> 14:19.530
You gonna give me
that 50 cents back?

14:26.483 --> 14:28.007
Are you feeling okay?

14:28.085 --> 14:29.552
Not as good as that waiter.

14:29.953 --> 14:31.921
$20. What a racket.

14:35.359 --> 14:39.262
Listen, this is a little embarrassing,
but maybe I'm getting old.

14:39.631 --> 14:41.565
I forgot the name
of the target.

14:41.900 --> 14:44.391
It's okay because
I didn't tell you his name.

14:45.270 --> 14:48.262
Can you put that gun down
and come sit with me?

14:57.049 --> 14:58.778
Mmm, good boy.

14:59.285 --> 15:01.549
Actually, I don't know
this guy's name either,

15:01.620 --> 15:03.417
but we're gonna
find it out tonight.

15:03.856 --> 15:05.847
I hope it's that waiter.

15:06.559 --> 15:07.719
Here.

15:09.196 --> 15:10.185
Cheers.

15:16.736 --> 15:17.896
You're not even
drinking it.

15:17.971 --> 15:19.495
Yeah, I'm trying
to cut down.

15:22.442 --> 15:25.674
Well, I hope you're not
giving up all your vices.

15:32.320 --> 15:33.344
Is there a problem?

15:33.421 --> 15:34.888
I have a girlfriend.

15:35.523 --> 15:37.047
You have a girlfriend?

15:37.158 --> 15:40.390
Well, as I recall, that's never
been a problem for you in the past.

15:41.330 --> 15:42.763
Here's the thing.

15:44.266 --> 15:46.427
We're sort of going steady.

15:46.835 --> 15:49.668
Steady? Well, I think
that's sweet.

15:51.340 --> 15:52.329
She's here.

15:52.407 --> 15:54.069
Here in the room?
Yeah, no.

15:54.244 --> 15:55.973
She's here
in Los Angeles.

15:56.045 --> 15:58.206
I mean, she could
come in any minute.

15:58.448 --> 16:01.281
She might want to kiss
me, too. She's pretty.

16:01.751 --> 16:03.776
We kiss all the time.

16:04.153 --> 16:05.415
What was her name?

16:05.822 --> 16:07.119
Natalie.

16:07.423 --> 16:09.722
Natalie Teegerb.

16:10.094 --> 16:11.083
Teegerb?

16:11.161 --> 16:13.061
With a "B" on the end.

16:13.264 --> 16:15.255
It's Canadian.
It's French Canadian.

16:15.366 --> 16:17.197
Well, I'd like
to meet her.

16:19.203 --> 16:20.329
Bring her tonight.

16:20.404 --> 16:22.463
Oh, no, I don't...
Oh, no, I insist.

16:22.974 --> 16:25.442
A girl's gotta know what she's
up against. You know what I mean?

16:26.511 --> 16:28.911
We'll be at the Victory Club
up Laurel Canyon.

16:30.148 --> 16:31.615
Will Jimmy be there?

16:32.117 --> 16:34.642
Well, that's pretty much
a safe bet. He owns the joint.

16:34.819 --> 16:37.550
Just meet us at the bar
at around 8:00. All right?

16:44.163 --> 16:46.688
Well, I guess you have
a date, Miss Teegerb.

17:02.716 --> 17:04.377
It's so loud.

17:04.451 --> 17:05.509
I like it.

17:05.585 --> 17:07.577
You want
to dance, Frankie?

17:07.655 --> 17:10.589
Frankie don't dance.
Neither do I.

17:10.892 --> 17:13.053
Natalie, I can't do this.

17:13.127 --> 17:14.958
I'm not a tough guy.
Who am I fooling?

17:15.029 --> 17:16.621
You're fooling everybody.
You're doing great.

17:16.698 --> 17:18.063
I've been listening
to you all day.

17:18.132 --> 17:20.191
If I didn't know you,
I wouldn't even know you.

17:21.368 --> 17:22.358
Help you?

17:22.604 --> 17:26.369
I hope so. Can you turn the
music down just a little?

17:26.442 --> 17:29.377
You gotta be kidding me,
buddy. This is a dance club.

17:29.445 --> 17:31.913
You don't like the music,
take a hike.

17:32.381 --> 17:33.848
Okay, sorry.

17:33.916 --> 17:35.474
We're looking
for Jimmy Barlowe.

17:35.551 --> 17:37.486
Never heard of him. What
about his friend Lola?

17:38.455 --> 17:41.856
All right, if you see him, tell him
Frankie DePalma's looking for him.

17:41.925 --> 17:43.358
Mr. DePalma?

17:44.728 --> 17:46.719
I had no idea.

17:46.796 --> 17:49.094
I'm new here.
My name's Charlie.

17:54.238 --> 17:56.172
Let me turn
the music down.

17:59.243 --> 18:00.301
Is that okay?

18:00.378 --> 18:01.367
What do you think?

18:02.346 --> 18:03.813
I could turn it off.

18:05.149 --> 18:07.414
You're right.
It's much better this way.

18:07.619 --> 18:08.916
Good call.

18:08.987 --> 18:11.148
Hey, what happened?

18:11.823 --> 18:12.983
Who turned it off?

18:13.058 --> 18:14.252
It was hurting my ears.

18:14.326 --> 18:15.452
Who the hell are you?
Hey.

18:15.527 --> 18:18.121
Whoa. That's
Frankie DePalma, Jake.

18:18.330 --> 18:20.799
Oh, hell, Frankie...
Mr. DePalma, I had no idea.

18:20.867 --> 18:22.801
I'm really sorry. Here,
let me buy you a drink.

18:22.935 --> 18:25.335
It won't happen again.
I'm really, really sorry.

18:25.405 --> 18:28.272
Hey, why don't
you relax? Walk it off.

18:28.341 --> 18:30.639
Give Frankie a chance
to cool down.

18:34.647 --> 18:37.515
Same old Frankie.
I can't take you anywhere.

18:38.118 --> 18:40.609
You must be Natalie.
You're a lucky woman.

18:40.954 --> 18:41.943
I know I am.

18:42.289 --> 18:44.189
Well, enjoy it
while you can.

18:44.691 --> 18:47.353
We should get going.
Jimmy's in the back, waiting.

18:48.328 --> 18:49.920
Jimmy's in the back.

18:49.997 --> 18:51.590
I'll take
good care of him.

19:03.845 --> 19:06.815
That's him?
Doesn't look like much.

19:07.149 --> 19:10.312
Uncle Jimmy, I could have done this
job. I would've done it for free.

19:10.386 --> 19:12.445
I told you, Lenny.
I needed the best.

19:12.521 --> 19:14.580
Just shut up and watch.
And who knows,

19:14.657 --> 19:16.989
maybe you might
learn something.

19:18.928 --> 19:22.695
Frankie DePalma,
this is Jimmy Barlowe.

19:23.567 --> 19:26.627
Frankie DePalma,
I hear good things.

19:26.770 --> 19:28.533
About me? Yeah, of course about you.

19:28.605 --> 19:29.936
Otherwise,
why would I say it?

19:30.974 --> 19:32.464
This is
my nephew, Lenny.

19:33.043 --> 19:35.035
And of course you
already know Tony G.

19:35.379 --> 19:37.108
We haven't seen
each other since Miami.

19:37.348 --> 19:39.441
It must have been,
what, three, four years?

19:39.517 --> 19:41.075
Sounds about right.

19:42.353 --> 19:43.650
So how is Fat Gordy?

19:43.721 --> 19:46.349
Still fat.
He got fatter.

19:46.757 --> 19:50.956
Actually, he's thinking about
changing his name to Fatter Gordy.

19:51.396 --> 19:54.194
Listen, Frankie, before you
and the boss get started,

19:54.299 --> 19:56.130
little Davey was
my second cousin.

19:56.268 --> 19:59.795
His family would like to, you know,
bury the kid, get a little closure.

20:00.506 --> 20:03.236
But we only got a head and one
leg. We can't find the rest of him.

20:03.375 --> 20:06.004
Maybe you could
help us out, you know?

20:06.212 --> 20:07.679
I'll think about it.

20:08.515 --> 20:09.504
Whoa, what are
you doing?

20:09.582 --> 20:12.312
Your tie is crooked.

20:13.052 --> 20:14.713
Okay, I get it,
I get it.

20:14.787 --> 20:17.620
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have asked
anything about little Davey. Okay?

20:17.690 --> 20:20.353
Do whatever you gotta do.
It's none of my business.

20:20.427 --> 20:21.917
I'm sorry I even asked.

20:22.863 --> 20:25.127
Is someone gonna
tell me why I'm here?

20:25.566 --> 20:28.091
Business first.
Oh, I like that.

20:29.503 --> 20:32.097
There's a guy
up in Ventura.

20:32.640 --> 20:35.439
His name is Greenblatt,
Stanley Greenblatt.

20:36.111 --> 20:37.976
And he needs
to have an accident.

20:38.780 --> 20:39.906
What kind of accident?

20:39.981 --> 20:41.949
Your kind of accident.

20:42.484 --> 20:46.352
Job is a piece of cake. Okay, guy
lives alone. He's, like, 100 years old.

20:46.688 --> 20:49.157
Here they are.
Thank you.

20:49.625 --> 20:51.650
Lola said that
you're a connoisseur.

20:51.727 --> 20:54.423
You're gonna like these.
These are Cohibas. Hand-rolled.

20:58.201 --> 20:59.498
Sweet.

20:59.602 --> 21:00.591
You know,
I was wondering,

21:01.070 --> 21:03.163
are these things gonna taste
as good when they're legal?

21:03.340 --> 21:04.967
Know what I mean?

21:12.149 --> 21:15.880
Hey. You... You don't
cut off the tip?

21:15.953 --> 21:18.115
No. No,
that's too easy.

21:20.992 --> 21:22.084
So...

21:23.695 --> 21:26.926
This Greenblatt guy,
what'd he do?

21:28.466 --> 21:30.798
Lola said you didn't ask any questions.

21:30.868 --> 21:33.064
Why would she say that?

21:33.138 --> 21:35.402
That's another question.
What...

21:35.474 --> 21:37.806
Look, my uncle says, "Do it,"
you put this old guy down, okay?

21:37.876 --> 21:40.572
That's the job. That's
all you need to know.

21:40.646 --> 21:41.635
What...

21:45.451 --> 21:48.182
It doesn't make sense.
This guy's a nobody.

21:48.255 --> 21:50.416
Stanley Greenblatt,
75 years old.

21:50.490 --> 21:53.288
Oh. It's his birthday
today, actually.

21:53.360 --> 21:56.488
He's a retired UPS
driver. He lives alone.

21:56.563 --> 21:59.657
He's a widower. He's got
one son, one daughter.

21:59.733 --> 22:01.530
Son died last year.

22:02.637 --> 22:03.626
And?

22:03.704 --> 22:05.899
And nothing. Guy's
never been arrested.

22:06.474 --> 22:08.669
There's no mob
connection, whatsoever.

22:08.743 --> 22:09.767
I mean,
as far as we know,

22:09.844 --> 22:11.175
he's never even
met Jimmy Barlowe.

22:11.245 --> 22:13.042
So, then, why does
Barlowe want him dead?

22:13.114 --> 22:15.947
And why would he pay
somebody 80 grand to do it?

22:16.017 --> 22:17.383
Maybe, it's
an insurance scam.

22:17.452 --> 22:19.784
Doesn't track. The guy's not
insured by anyone for anything.

22:19.855 --> 22:22.517
He's broke, living
on a fixed income.

22:22.591 --> 22:25.116
Jimmy B never said anything
about why he wanted him killed?

22:25.193 --> 22:26.251
No.

22:27.796 --> 22:29.058
Agent Stone,
can we go home now?

22:29.131 --> 22:31.156
Mr. Monk did
everything you said.

22:31.233 --> 22:33.361
This has been
really hard on him.

22:33.436 --> 22:35.336
He has trouble enough
just being himself.

22:35.405 --> 22:37.066
And I appreciate that,
Miss Teeger, I really do,

22:37.140 --> 22:39.233
but we don't have
the whole picture yet.

22:39.309 --> 22:41.004
Right? Who's
Stanley Greenblatt?

22:41.077 --> 22:42.476
Why is there
a contract on him?

22:42.545 --> 22:45.105
I mean, until we know that,
our job's not done here.

22:45.348 --> 22:48.250
It won't take much
longer. Just a day or two.

22:48.752 --> 22:50.583
What do you think?
Can you keep going?

22:55.059 --> 22:57.653
Randy and I can check out
the old man for you.

22:57.728 --> 23:00.561
Sure, I appreciate that. Thank you.

23:00.631 --> 23:02.600
You get out of here,
both of you!

23:02.667 --> 23:04.066
I'm gonna call
the police.

23:04.135 --> 23:06.467
Mr. Greenblatt, we are the
police. We're here to help you.

23:06.538 --> 23:09.769
I don't need your help.
Just leave me alone!

23:09.841 --> 23:12.071
Sir, we think you might be in danger.

23:12.143 --> 23:13.508
I don't give a damn
what you think!

23:13.578 --> 23:14.943
Would you get out
of my house?

23:15.013 --> 23:17.539
Have you ever seen
this man before?

23:17.616 --> 23:20.710
His name's Jimmy Barlowe,
also known as Mad Jimmy.

23:20.786 --> 23:22.549
He owns a couple
of casinos in Reno.

23:22.621 --> 23:25.556
I never heard of him,
okay? You satisfied?

23:25.825 --> 23:26.883
Yeah, well,
he knows you.

23:26.959 --> 23:29.086
I don't give a damn
who knows me.

23:29.161 --> 23:31.562
Why don't you people
just leave me alone?

23:31.631 --> 23:33.121
You're gonna give me
a heart attack.

23:34.234 --> 23:35.223
Sir, we can
protect you.

23:35.302 --> 23:36.428
We can put you
in a safe house.

23:36.503 --> 23:38.130
Oh, no, I'm not
going anywhere,

23:38.205 --> 23:40.036
not with you
or with anyone.

23:40.107 --> 23:41.836
Goodbye, goodbye,
goodbye.

23:41.908 --> 23:43.341
I think he wants us to leave. You think?

23:45.947 --> 23:46.971
Whoa. Whoa!

23:47.048 --> 23:48.037
Jeez!

23:48.583 --> 23:50.380
Stanley, we're leaving!

23:50.451 --> 23:52.851
Why would Jimmy Barlowe
want to kill this guy?

23:52.920 --> 23:54.251
Maybe he met him.

23:54.322 --> 23:55.346
You okay?

23:55.423 --> 23:57.152
I'm all right. That must have stung.

24:01.897 --> 24:03.831
Frankie,
how's it look?

24:04.967 --> 24:05.991
How's what look?

24:06.068 --> 24:07.933
The job.
The old man.

24:10.105 --> 24:11.902
How are you
gonna get in?

24:11.974 --> 24:13.965
I don't know. I haven't seen the house.

24:14.042 --> 24:15.340
You haven't even cased the joint yet?

24:15.412 --> 24:16.401
No.

24:16.479 --> 24:17.503
What the hell
you been doing?

24:17.580 --> 24:20.447
Relax, Lenny. This is the way he works.

24:20.517 --> 24:21.814
He's methodical.

24:21.885 --> 24:23.443
Adrian?

24:23.787 --> 24:25.084
Adrian?

24:26.055 --> 24:27.750
Adrian?

24:28.992 --> 24:30.358
Adrian?

24:30.995 --> 24:32.428
Adrian?

24:33.164 --> 24:35.291
Adrian? Adrian?

24:35.366 --> 24:40.360
Adrian? Adrian? Adrian?
Adrian? Adrian?

24:41.839 --> 24:43.568
I thought
that was you.

24:43.641 --> 24:45.371
Are you
on vacation, too?

24:45.444 --> 24:47.935
I didn't think you
ever left San Francisco.

24:48.013 --> 24:51.141
I didn't think you ever
left your living room.

24:51.216 --> 24:52.774
Isn't this
weather amazing?

24:52.851 --> 24:54.409
You don't even have to
check the weather report.

24:54.486 --> 24:56.454
Every day is
78 and sunny.

24:56.655 --> 24:59.180
It's like paradise.
Harold Krenshaw.

24:59.826 --> 25:01.521
How you doing?

25:04.096 --> 25:06.257
How do you guys
know Adrian?

25:06.332 --> 25:09.495
I'm sorry, pal.
You got the wrong guy.

25:09.569 --> 25:11.036
Do I look like
an Adrian?

25:11.103 --> 25:12.297
You believe
this guy?

25:12.371 --> 25:15.239
Adrian, what
are you doing?

25:15.309 --> 25:16.674
Hey, pal.

25:17.411 --> 25:19.470
You're making
a mistake.

25:19.546 --> 25:21.639
Now, you got a decision to make here.

25:21.715 --> 25:23.080
You want to be
in the papers tomorrow,

25:23.150 --> 25:27.553
in the obituary section,
section D?

25:28.422 --> 25:30.618
You made a mistake. Go home.

25:32.260 --> 25:33.386
Do it.

25:33.761 --> 25:35.661
Ow! Ow!
Do it.

25:35.730 --> 25:37.721
I'm sorry. I thought that
you were somebody else.

25:37.799 --> 25:38.823
Bye.

25:47.476 --> 25:49.034
What the hell
are you looking at?

25:49.111 --> 25:51.443
Finish your
Shirley Temple.

25:53.048 --> 25:54.675
What'd I tell you, huh?

25:54.750 --> 25:57.446
Let's get the check.
I lost my appetite.

26:07.163 --> 26:08.596
Still wearing
the suit, huh?

26:08.665 --> 26:11.225
Didn't get a chance to change?

26:11.301 --> 26:14.066
Why should I change? This
coffee's cold. Tastes like BM.

26:15.172 --> 26:16.196
It's iced tea.

26:16.274 --> 26:17.502
Well, warm it up.

26:17.575 --> 26:19.304
So, you want tea?

26:19.377 --> 26:22.346
No. I want
warm iced tea.

26:24.448 --> 26:26.279
Okay. That's it.

26:26.617 --> 26:28.779
We're pulling the plug.
This operation is over.

26:28.854 --> 26:29.980
Yeah. I think
you're right.

26:30.055 --> 26:31.454
What? What are you talking about?

26:31.523 --> 26:34.014
I'm not quitting now. Why
should I? I'm in the zone.

26:34.092 --> 26:35.252
I'm Frankie DePalma.

26:35.327 --> 26:39.354
No, you're not. Monk,
you're in too deep.

26:39.431 --> 26:40.625
I've seen it
happen before.

26:40.699 --> 26:42.963
Even real cops, when they go undercover,

26:43.035 --> 26:44.162
they get
their wires crossed.

26:44.237 --> 26:45.295
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

26:45.371 --> 26:47.271
What do you mean,
"even real cops"?

26:48.641 --> 26:49.699
That's not what I meant to say.

26:49.776 --> 26:52.074
I'm not quitting. I'm
in too far to quit now.

26:52.145 --> 26:54.875
Look, we're close.
We have the who.

26:55.515 --> 26:57.779
All we need is
the why. Right?

26:57.850 --> 26:59.785
Why do they want to kill the old guy?

26:59.853 --> 27:01.480
You know what?
We're calling Dr. Bell.

27:01.555 --> 27:02.544
Why?

27:02.623 --> 27:04.215
Because you're enjoying
this way too much.

27:04.291 --> 27:06.088
I think you like
scaring people.

27:06.160 --> 27:08.458
I think you've been so
repressed and powerless

27:08.529 --> 27:11.054
for so many years, it's
just gushing out of you.

27:11.131 --> 27:13.066
You are not yourself.

27:13.134 --> 27:16.103
Or maybe you're meeting the
real me for the first time.

27:16.171 --> 27:18.105
Mr. Monk, that was
Harold Krenshaw

27:18.173 --> 27:19.435
you were pushing
around this morning.

27:19.507 --> 27:20.804
Okay, look,
I'm in charge.

27:20.875 --> 27:22.467
It's my call. We're pulling the plug.

27:22.544 --> 27:24.011
Well, you can't stop me.

27:24.079 --> 27:25.137
Can't keep me here.

27:25.213 --> 27:28.206
I'm gonna finish what I
started with you or without you.

27:32.888 --> 27:35.550
Monk, sit down.

27:41.597 --> 27:43.498
Get out
of my way, Leland.

27:54.745 --> 27:56.406
I'll be in touch.

28:00.151 --> 28:02.381
Now, who the hell
was that?

28:14.933 --> 28:16.264
Hello?

28:16.969 --> 28:17.958
Oh.

28:18.337 --> 28:20.771
Hmm. I knew
you'd come.

28:20.839 --> 28:22.636
Like a moth
to a flame.

28:23.409 --> 28:25.434
How did it go?

28:25.511 --> 28:27.036
What, you didn't
kill him?

28:27.113 --> 28:28.478
Not yet.

28:29.182 --> 28:31.912
Why not? Was there a problem?

28:31.985 --> 28:33.885
Frankie, you give your
word to Jimmy Barlowe,

28:33.953 --> 28:35.352
you damn well
better keep it.

28:35.422 --> 28:37.390
I'm not whacking anybody
until I know why.

28:37.457 --> 28:40.324
Who is this guy Greenblatt,
and why is he so important?

28:40.393 --> 28:41.827
Since when
do you care?

28:41.896 --> 28:44.888
Did you forget what you
said to me in Barcelona?

28:44.965 --> 28:47.957
The minute you start asking
why, it's time to get out.

28:48.035 --> 28:51.095
I don't want to talk about
Barcelona. That's ancient history.

28:51.539 --> 28:54.474
Well, that's what I've
been trying to tell you.

28:54.542 --> 28:56.340
Does Natalie know
you're here?

28:56.578 --> 28:59.012
Is she ancient
history, too?

28:59.081 --> 29:00.673
I was just getting ready for bed.

29:01.616 --> 29:03.584
You want
to do my legs?

29:04.786 --> 29:06.754
No more games, Lola.

29:06.822 --> 29:09.916
Who is Stanley Greenblatt?
I need to know!

29:10.559 --> 29:13.154
Fine. Frankie, you win.
I'll tell you.

29:13.663 --> 29:15.290
But you need to come
and sit with me.

29:16.699 --> 29:18.826
The room might
be bugged.

29:23.940 --> 29:25.202
Closer.

29:31.014 --> 29:32.481
I don't know.

29:43.628 --> 29:45.118
Who are you?

29:45.196 --> 29:46.959
You know who I am.

29:47.565 --> 29:52.502
I'm Fred Adrian...
DePalmonk.

29:53.638 --> 29:55.003
What?

29:55.374 --> 29:56.864
I'm Adrian.

29:56.942 --> 29:59.740
Wait a second.
No, no. I'm confused here.

30:02.615 --> 30:04.583
What's going on?
Are you okay?

30:04.650 --> 30:07.175
You're acting like you're,
like, hypnotized or something.

30:08.320 --> 30:09.309
Lola.

30:09.722 --> 30:11.486
Great. Stay.

30:13.360 --> 30:15.123
Hold on.
What's going on?

30:15.195 --> 30:16.594
Have you seen Frankie?

30:16.663 --> 30:18.153
Yeah, he's over there,
I think.

30:18.765 --> 30:20.494
I've been looking
all over for you.

30:23.270 --> 30:25.102
What are you doing?

30:25.840 --> 30:27.034
I'm rinsing.

30:27.108 --> 30:29.599
Uncle Jimmy's
furious, okay?

30:30.511 --> 30:31.569
He says,
"No more excuses. "

30:31.646 --> 30:34.046
He wants the old man dead tonight.

30:34.115 --> 30:36.242
We're sick and tired of waiting
for his funeral, you know?

30:36.317 --> 30:38.808
No. Tonight, no.
No, sorry.

30:39.621 --> 30:41.452
Tonight's no good.
Here's the thing.

30:41.523 --> 30:43.115
I made other plans.

30:43.192 --> 30:45.558
I'm whacking somebody
else in Pasadena later.

30:45.627 --> 30:47.254
I've already bought
the bullet, so...

30:47.329 --> 30:51.026
Jimmy said if you don't
do it or you can't do it,

30:51.099 --> 30:52.896
then I get the gig.

30:52.968 --> 30:56.029
So what's it gonna be?
You want the job or not?

30:58.208 --> 30:59.732
Then let's get
this done.

30:59.809 --> 31:02.334
We... We're gonna have to
go out through the basement.

31:02.412 --> 31:03.401
I saw some guy
in the lobby.

31:03.479 --> 31:06.243
He didn't look right to me.
I think it might be a cop.

31:06.316 --> 31:07.442
We'll take my car.

31:07.517 --> 31:10.078
It's okay.
You stay here.

31:10.154 --> 31:11.917
I'll take care of the
old man. I'll whack him,

31:11.989 --> 31:13.251
and I'll call you
when it's over.

31:13.324 --> 31:16.088
No, no, no, no. Jimmy
wants me to go along.

31:17.394 --> 31:19.191
He insisted actually.

31:20.064 --> 31:22.760
Looks like we're
gonna be a team.

31:24.336 --> 31:25.325
Okay.

31:53.834 --> 31:54.858
What's the problem?

31:54.935 --> 31:56.630
I don't like it.
It's too quiet.

31:58.205 --> 31:59.763
What do you mean,
"It's too quiet"?

31:59.840 --> 32:01.740
Quiet is a good thing.

32:01.875 --> 32:04.036
You want a parade?
Come on, let's do this.

32:11.052 --> 32:14.749
I just remembered. I forgot
my gun. It's my lucky gun.

32:16.391 --> 32:17.619
What do you need
a gun for?

32:17.692 --> 32:19.990
It's supposed to look like an accident.

32:20.061 --> 32:21.085
Right.

32:22.297 --> 32:25.631
Okay. I'll go in. You stay
out here. You stay by the car.

32:25.701 --> 32:29.330
I need a lookout. You see
somebody, you honk the horn.

32:30.539 --> 32:32.268
Yeah, okay.

32:43.753 --> 32:45.812
Mr. Greenblatt?

32:46.256 --> 32:48.520
Hello? Stanley?

32:48.591 --> 32:51.685
My name is Adrian Monk.
I'm with the police.

32:51.761 --> 32:53.457
Mr. Greenblatt?

32:53.864 --> 32:55.126
Hello?

32:57.234 --> 32:58.758
Mr. Greenblatt?

33:01.505 --> 33:02.836
My God.

33:24.230 --> 33:25.458
He dead?

33:25.531 --> 33:27.123
Heart attack.

33:27.633 --> 33:28.622
Hey,

33:29.736 --> 33:31.203
you got lucky.

33:39.446 --> 33:40.504
Captain, do you
have a minute?

33:40.581 --> 33:43.482
Mr. Monk would like
to say something.

33:43.784 --> 33:45.046
Sorry.

33:45.119 --> 33:47.713
Mr. Monk, you have
to do it in person.

33:52.727 --> 33:54.092
I'm sorry.

33:54.829 --> 33:56.626
Show him the card.

34:00.235 --> 34:01.896
Go ahead, read it.

34:04.873 --> 34:06.967
"I was udderly wrong. "

34:08.277 --> 34:10.768
It's a cow. Udders.

34:12.614 --> 34:14.047
"I'm sorry
if I upset you.

34:14.116 --> 34:16.175
"Please give me
another chance.

34:16.351 --> 34:19.047
"I would hate
for my careless gesture

34:19.789 --> 34:22.121
"to spoil
our fine romance... "

34:25.362 --> 34:27.626
It's the only one
they had.

34:28.532 --> 34:30.123
Thank you, Monk.

34:31.768 --> 34:34.032
I realize how hard this
must have been for you

34:34.103 --> 34:36.733
to have Natalie
buy it for you.

34:36.841 --> 34:39.469
Okay, I bought it, but
Mr. Monk paid for it.

34:40.610 --> 34:42.043
Or he will.

34:42.580 --> 34:44.411
The point is he knows
he went too far,

34:44.482 --> 34:46.143
and he feels terrible.

34:46.217 --> 34:47.980
He'd never had that
kind of power before.

34:48.052 --> 34:49.679
It was like a drug.
It went to his head.

34:49.754 --> 34:50.779
But he learned
his lesson.

34:50.856 --> 34:53.120
Why don't you tell the captain
what you learned?

34:53.192 --> 34:54.955
I'm not a tough guy.

34:56.695 --> 34:57.923
Sure you are.

34:58.230 --> 35:00.095
I don't think so.

35:00.365 --> 35:04.802
Monk, you are one of
the toughest guys I know.

35:04.870 --> 35:07.533
No. You just don't advertise it.

35:07.607 --> 35:10.405
But it's in you.
It's buried deep down.

35:10.844 --> 35:12.903
You fooled all those
wiseguys, didn't you?

35:12.979 --> 35:14.879
You couldn't have done
that unless it was in you.

35:14.948 --> 35:18.008
And you stood up to me.
I'm proud of you, man.

35:18.084 --> 35:19.574
I don't feel it.

35:19.652 --> 35:22.884
I had it.
I had it for one day,

35:22.957 --> 35:24.948
but it's gone.

35:25.025 --> 35:27.493
It's not gone.
It's there.

35:28.062 --> 35:31.327
When the chips are down,
and it really matters,

35:32.500 --> 35:34.058
you'll find it.

35:34.535 --> 35:36.094
What happened
to Jimmy Barlowe?

35:36.171 --> 35:37.638
Nothing.
We can't touch him.

35:37.706 --> 35:39.833
Technically, there was
no crime committed.

35:39.908 --> 35:41.000
But Mr. Greenblatt...

35:41.076 --> 35:45.035
Died of natural causes. There was
no murder. No cash changed hands.

35:45.647 --> 35:48.207
I just talked to Agent
Stone. The case is closed.

35:48.583 --> 35:49.777
I still don't understand.

35:49.852 --> 35:52.047
Why would the mob
want to kill him?

35:52.121 --> 35:55.181
Nobody knows.
Probably never will.

35:56.325 --> 35:57.724
So that's it.

35:57.793 --> 35:59.454
Hey, thanks
for the card.

35:59.529 --> 36:01.463
I'll put it
with my collection.

36:02.932 --> 36:04.730
Oh, those are nice.
From your boys?

36:04.801 --> 36:05.825
Yep.

36:14.711 --> 36:18.272
Two birthday cards
from your sons.

36:19.651 --> 36:21.141
That's right.

36:22.053 --> 36:25.318
They both sent you a card.

36:26.624 --> 36:27.613
That's right.

36:27.692 --> 36:30.024
You have two children

36:30.695 --> 36:32.890
so you got two cards...

36:32.964 --> 36:36.833
You know, Monk, not saying
anything is always an option.

36:36.902 --> 36:40.133
Leland, when I was
in Greenblatt's house,

36:41.106 --> 36:43.870
<i>he had two birthday cards
on his mantle.</i>

36:44.210 --> 36:48.203
They both said,
"Happy birthday, Dad. "

36:48.480 --> 36:51.279
There were two cards.

36:51.952 --> 36:54.216
What does that mean,
two cards?

36:57.591 --> 36:59.889
You were right. I don't
know how we missed it.

36:59.960 --> 37:01.291
Greenblatt's son, Alvin,

37:01.361 --> 37:02.453
the one
who died last year,

37:02.529 --> 37:04.725
he worked part-time for one
of Jimmy Barlowe's casinos.

37:04.799 --> 37:06.630
They never
found a body.

37:06.701 --> 37:09.033
That's right. He drowned near
Catalina. There was no body.

37:09.103 --> 37:10.627
Okay, someone want to
tell me what's going on?

37:10.705 --> 37:13.435
Alvin Greenblatt
is alive.

37:13.507 --> 37:16.203
We're thinking he stole
some money from the casino,

37:16.277 --> 37:18.678
and then faked
his own death.

37:18.747 --> 37:20.738
He's alive?
Are we sure about this?

37:20.816 --> 37:23.683
Well, he sent his dad
a birthday card last week.

37:24.419 --> 37:26.182
Lenny said
that they were, quote,

37:26.255 --> 37:29.053
"Tired of waiting
for the old man's funeral. "

37:29.558 --> 37:32.857
This wasn't about Stanley
Greenblatt. It never was.

37:33.563 --> 37:34.962
It was about his son.

37:35.031 --> 37:36.965
They've been looking
for Alvin for a year.

37:37.033 --> 37:38.500
That's why
they wanted Stanley dead.

37:38.568 --> 37:40.229
They were trying to lure
his son out of hiding.

37:40.303 --> 37:42.897
They figured he wouldn't
miss his father's funeral.

37:42.972 --> 37:44.337
So he's here?

37:44.407 --> 37:47.376
I don't see Alvin.
Nobody's here.

37:47.910 --> 37:49.776
Why am I not surprised?

37:49.913 --> 37:52.347
I think
we're too late.

37:52.416 --> 37:54.145
Maybe they picked
him up at the airport.

37:54.752 --> 37:55.844
Great.

38:01.525 --> 38:03.721
I've been waiting a
year and a half for this.

38:04.896 --> 38:06.523
Where's my money,
you son of a bitch?

38:06.598 --> 38:08.964
I don't...
Okay, okay!

38:09.034 --> 38:10.626
I'll tell you.
I've got it.

38:10.702 --> 38:15.969
It's... I buried it. It's in
my attic under some floorboards.

38:16.741 --> 38:19.472
Hey, Alvin, I got
some bad news for you.

38:20.713 --> 38:21.941
I believe you.

38:23.783 --> 38:25.444
Kill him.

38:25.518 --> 38:26.542
Oh, no, God!

38:26.619 --> 38:27.916
Is this
a private party?

38:28.354 --> 38:30.083
Frankie, I thought
you left town.

38:30.156 --> 38:31.145
What are
you wearing?

38:31.223 --> 38:32.816
Chanel No. 5.
What are you wearing?

38:32.893 --> 38:33.951
What?

38:34.227 --> 38:35.854
I figured out
what was going on.

38:36.163 --> 38:38.927
Put two and two together. This
is Greenblatt's kid, right?

38:38.999 --> 38:40.432
What's he into you for?

38:40.500 --> 38:42.991
700 grand. But we got what we need.

38:43.070 --> 38:44.230
We're gonna
finish him.

38:44.304 --> 38:46.636
Let me do it.
Give me the gun.

38:48.309 --> 38:49.298
Why? What for?

38:49.377 --> 38:51.368
I'm a professional, all right? What?

38:51.446 --> 38:53.107
Hey, I got
a reputation.

38:53.181 --> 38:54.170
His old man
keeled over

38:54.248 --> 38:55.579
10 minutes before
I got there.

38:55.650 --> 38:58.210
I felt like a fool.
It pissed me off.

38:58.286 --> 39:00.880
Let me do it. No charge. On the house.

39:01.589 --> 39:02.852
For my own
peace of mind.

39:02.925 --> 39:04.392
I just want to put
this kid 10 feet under.

39:04.460 --> 39:05.757
You mean
six feet under.

39:05.828 --> 39:08.422
Whatever you want. I
prefer 10. It's up to you.

39:08.497 --> 39:09.725
Give me the gun.

39:09.798 --> 39:11.527
No, I'm gonna do it.
I wanna do it!

39:12.668 --> 39:14.499
Give me the gun.

39:16.505 --> 39:17.939
Lenny.

39:19.609 --> 39:21.076
Leonard.

39:23.980 --> 39:25.504
Give me the gun.

39:32.790 --> 39:34.758
Okay, fine,
you do it.

39:35.559 --> 39:38.153
No, don't! Don't!

39:39.163 --> 39:41.188
Nobody move!
Don't move.

39:41.265 --> 39:42.857
FBI! Get 'em up. Get 'em up.

39:42.933 --> 39:44.491
Let me see
your hands!

39:44.568 --> 39:47.299
I told you this guy
wasn't right! I knew it!

39:50.609 --> 39:53.669
I told you, you had it
in you all along.

39:53.745 --> 39:55.838
Mr. Monk, are you all
right? I was so scared.

39:55.914 --> 39:57.905
You and me both.

40:00.285 --> 40:01.913
Great job, Monk.

40:05.458 --> 40:09.554
Frankie DePalma,
you're a dead man.

40:11.130 --> 40:13.564
Actually, he's been dead since Friday.

40:17.271 --> 40:19.136
I knew
you wasn't right.

40:22.810 --> 40:24.004
Well,
what do you think?

40:24.077 --> 40:26.477
I mean, it's making
so much ice.

40:26.547 --> 40:27.912
It won't stop
making ice.

40:27.981 --> 40:29.539
Yeah, I understand.

40:29.616 --> 40:30.982
If you could
back up a little.

40:33.254 --> 40:35.415
Yeah, okay,
here it is.

40:35.490 --> 40:37.981
Yeah, the shut-off
thingy broke off.

40:38.059 --> 40:39.356
Think I got one
in my truck.

40:39.427 --> 40:40.485
I can fix it
for you right now.

40:40.562 --> 40:41.551
Great.

40:41.629 --> 40:43.153
It'll cost you 200.

40:43.231 --> 40:44.892
It's not even
a week old.

40:44.966 --> 40:46.491
There must be
some kind of warranty.

40:46.569 --> 40:47.558
Yeah. Normally, yes.

40:47.636 --> 40:48.898
But it wasn't
hooked up correctly,

40:48.971 --> 40:51.565
so it's all
been voided.

40:51.640 --> 40:53.437
But you hooked it up.

40:53.509 --> 40:55.204
You hooked it up
last week.

40:55.277 --> 40:56.301
You want me
to fix it or not?

40:56.378 --> 40:58.312
Oh, you're
gonna fix it,

40:58.380 --> 41:00.542
and you're gonna
fix it for free.

41:01.885 --> 41:03.682
I don't think so.

41:05.489 --> 41:08.356
You're gonna
fix it for free.

41:09.059 --> 41:11.550
Not gonna happen.

41:35.254 --> 41:37.222
You know what, I...

41:37.289 --> 41:39.257
Yeah, I... I think
you're right, you know.

41:39.324 --> 41:40.848
I'm sure it's
still covered.

41:40.926 --> 41:43.190
I'll go
get that part.

41:48.301 --> 41:51.236
Hey, I still got it.

41:51.838 --> 41:53.897
Yeah, you still got it.
