00:43.744 --> 00:45.579
I thought Batman
was going to be here.

00:46.214 --> 00:48.182
Right? So strange.

00:49.517 --> 00:52.086
Booster Gold,

00:53.187 --> 00:54.722
I thought you were Animal Man.

Hey, champ.

You're both wrong, boys.

01:26.487 --> 01:28.656
You can call me Red Velvet.

01:29.357 --> 01:30.758
Ooh! Like the cake.

Ah!

02:00.854 --> 02:03.657
All right, Red Velvet.
Start talking.

of this Red Velvet?

02:13.267 --> 02:14.668
Who is she?

02:14.702 --> 02:16.637
Maybe Goldie Pants scammed her
out of some money.

02:16.670 --> 02:19.273
Scammed?
I'm not a con man.

02:19.307 --> 02:21.842

is a time traveler.

I'm here to see if you got
the present I sent yesterday.

has the mail come yet?

02:47.835 --> 02:49.270
It's Sunday.

02:49.303 --> 02:50.938

02:50.971 --> 02:53.274
They don't deliver mail
to volcanoes on Sunday?

It'll get here.

and blasted through

05:26.126 --> 05:28.629
BOOSTER: I was
at rock bottom. Then...

05:29.930 --> 05:32.032
I met Margot Montgomery,

05:32.065 --> 05:35.569
heir to the Montgomery
Regular Toilet fortune.

05:35.603 --> 05:37.638
It was love at first sight.

05:37.671 --> 05:40.107
From that day on,
we were inseparable.

05:40.140 --> 05:42.443
And even though she was
a woman of
wealth and class,

05:42.476 --> 05:45.446
and I was a broke
night watchman
at the Space-Time Museum,

05:45.479 --> 05:46.480
she agreed to be my wife.

05:47.415 --> 05:48.649
Then on the day
of our marriage,

05:48.682 --> 05:51.519
and Margot repeated
the Ministron 3000's words,

05:51.552 --> 05:53.587
"For richer or poorer,"

05:53.621 --> 05:55.122
it suddenly hit me.

05:55.155 --> 05:58.759
I had to do better by her.
I had to do more.

06:01.962 --> 06:04.131
So, I excused myself
from the ceremony,

06:04.164 --> 06:05.332
ran to the Space-Time Museum,

06:05.365 --> 06:07.668
and borrowed a time suit
on loan from
a "future" collection.

06:07.701 --> 06:11.605
I came to the 21st century
to earn my fortune,
so I could support us.

06:11.639 --> 06:13.607
You know, be a real partner.

06:13.641 --> 06:15.876
That's why you write books
and sell autographs.

06:15.909 --> 06:17.878
And develop that cartoon show.

06:17.911 --> 06:19.913
Hey, I'm very proud
of that show.

06:19.947 --> 06:22.550
Once I have enough money,
I'll travel back
to the moment I left,

06:22.583 --> 06:24.485
walk in, and marry
the love of my life.

06:24.518 --> 06:26.487
Except that you didn't.

06:26.520 --> 06:28.422
And you won't.

06:28.456 --> 06:31.158
I think you should leave
the time-traveling mechanics
to the pros, Bats.

06:31.191 --> 06:34.628
I just told you,
I haven't married her yet.

06:34.662 --> 06:37.631
I still have
the ring... somewhere.

06:37.665 --> 06:39.633
But we know you
won't marry her.

06:39.667 --> 06:41.902
Please, if I don't,
Margot would never forgive me.

06:41.935 --> 06:43.203

06:43.236 --> 06:44.672

06:44.705 --> 06:46.440

marry Margot,
because Red Velvet exists.

Listen, Goldie.
For whatever reason, you
don't go back to the future,

06:51.679 --> 06:53.581
you leave Margot at the altar,
it drives her mad,

06:53.614 --> 06:56.950
she becomes Red Velvet
and jumps back in time
to get revenge on you!

07:09.262 --> 07:10.664

07:33.587 --> 07:34.955
It's now or never, Booster.

07:34.988 --> 07:36.757
You have to go back
and marry Margot.

07:36.790 --> 07:38.626
It's the only way
to reset the timeline.

07:38.659 --> 07:41.261
So, she never becomes
Red Velvet and none of this
ever happens.

07:41.294 --> 07:43.230
You're right.
Let's go.

07:43.263 --> 07:46.967

07:57.845 --> 08:00.714
Well, MJ. That was about
the longest minute of my life.

08:00.748 --> 08:02.115
You don't know the half of it.

08:02.149 --> 08:02.950
Where did you go?

08:02.983 --> 08:05.519
I wanted today
to be extra special.

08:05.553 --> 08:08.121
So, I went back in time
and got you
a celebrity bridesmaid.

08:08.155 --> 08:11.058
And it's Batman,
history's greatest...

08:12.325 --> 08:14.027

08:14.061 --> 08:16.530
Initiate ring protocol.

that objects to this union,
speak now or...

08:26.674 --> 08:28.275
I do.

08:28.308 --> 08:31.612
Batman! You're about to ruin
the happiest day
of Margot's life.

08:31.645 --> 08:33.280
You're a terrible bridesmaid.

08:33.313 --> 08:36.016
Booster, when Red Velvet
attacked the Watchtower,

08:36.049 --> 08:38.619
she was wearing a gold and
ruby wedding band,

08:38.652 --> 08:41.288
identical to the one you put
on Margot's finger.

08:41.321 --> 08:43.223
It's the same ring.

08:43.256 --> 08:46.627
Wait, if it's the same ring,
when did Red Velvet
get a hold of it?

08:46.660 --> 08:48.195
Right now.

08:48.228 --> 08:51.064
It's not being left at the
altar that drives Margot mad,

08:51.098 --> 08:52.600
it's marrying you.

08:55.202 --> 08:59.172
Booster Gold was
the worst husband ever.
