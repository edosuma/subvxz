WEBVTT

00:01.435 --> 00:02.503
ADULT ADAM: Growing up,
there was nothing better

00:02.536 --> 00:04.405
than the magical
last week of school.

00:04.438 --> 00:07.007
It all began with crafting
the perfect yearbook message.

00:07.041 --> 00:08.442
How long is this?

00:08.476 --> 00:09.643
Six pages,
front and back.

00:09.677 --> 00:11.179
How long is yours?
One sentence.

00:11.212 --> 00:14.014
"You are
my turtle-necked stallion."

00:14.048 --> 00:16.484
This is the greatest thing
anyone's ever written me!

00:16.517 --> 00:18.186
ADULT ADAM:
For the seniors,
there was the tradition

00:18.219 --> 00:19.520
of the awkward class photo.

00:20.554 --> 00:21.855
Clear a hole, losers.

00:21.889 --> 00:23.857
Johnny Atkins is
finally graduating.

00:23.891 --> 00:25.259
You suck.
You're a dork.

00:25.293 --> 00:26.427
You're a nerd.

00:26.460 --> 00:27.928
I hate you.
You suck, too.

00:27.961 --> 00:29.863
Mr. Atkins,
I thought you knew.

00:29.897 --> 00:31.099
You failed five classes.

00:31.132 --> 00:32.533
You're definitely
not graduating.

00:32.566 --> 00:35.169
Forget what I just said.
Have a great summer.

00:35.203 --> 00:36.937
ADULT ADAM:
And who could forget
the ring salesman

00:36.970 --> 00:38.839
who grossly overestimated
teenage interest

00:38.872 --> 00:40.141
in bulky jewelry?

00:40.174 --> 00:41.342
Joss Stinn, bro?

00:41.375 --> 00:43.577
Is there any way you can take
off the name of our school

00:43.611 --> 00:45.779
and replace it with "JTP"
in emeralds?

00:45.813 --> 00:46.947
ALL: "JTP" in emeralds?

00:46.980 --> 00:48.116
No, there's not.

00:48.149 --> 00:49.183
You make me sad.

00:49.217 --> 00:50.718
Your rings are dumb.
Appreciate your time.

00:50.751 --> 00:53.287
ADULT ADAM:
And, of course, our school's
finest tradition,

00:53.321 --> 00:54.355
the senior prank...
(ALL SCREAM)

00:54.388 --> 00:56.490
Oh, no.
I'm going down!

00:56.524 --> 00:58.359
...which mostly just
pissed off our principal.

00:58.392 --> 01:01.662
Sweet Saran Wrap!
It gets worse every year!

01:01.695 --> 01:04.198
Amaro Jr.!
Is this your handiwork?

01:04.232 --> 01:05.399
He somehow knows
it was you.

01:05.433 --> 01:07.468
Run, Ruben! Run!
Nah.

01:07.501 --> 01:09.002
I'll walk at
a leisurely pace.

01:09.036 --> 01:11.004
But even better than
the traditional senior prank

01:11.038 --> 01:13.574
was the tradition of
planning the epic summer.

01:13.607 --> 01:15.509
C'mon, guys,
four friends in a van,

01:15.543 --> 01:17.811
following the Grateful Dead
all summer?
It will be super chill.

01:17.845 --> 01:19.480
(SCOFFS) I wish.
Why can't you?

01:19.513 --> 01:20.581
I can only tell you

01:20.614 --> 01:22.916
if it's under
the JTP cone of silence.

01:22.950 --> 01:24.652
ALL: JTP cone of silence!

01:24.685 --> 01:26.354
My plan for this summer is

01:26.387 --> 01:28.389
to spend as much time as I can
with Adam.

01:28.422 --> 01:29.890
Beautiful, bro.
Goosebumps.

01:29.923 --> 01:33.026
Yes, that's why
I made him this
in wood shop.

01:33.060 --> 01:35.263
Maybe instead of
an archaic homemade weapon,

01:35.296 --> 01:37.498
you just tell Adam
what he means to you.

01:37.531 --> 01:39.900
I will tell him
with the paddle.

01:39.933 --> 01:41.602
Yeah, I'm not sure
that's what
the paddle is saying.

01:41.635 --> 01:43.771
If anything,
it says "nerd basher."

01:43.804 --> 01:46.140
Yeah. As in
for the bashing of nerds.

01:46.174 --> 01:47.575
How are you not
getting this?

01:47.608 --> 01:50.043
As for me, I was
partaking in the tradition

01:50.077 --> 01:51.579
of taking over
your big brother's room.

01:51.612 --> 01:52.646
Hey, Schmoo.

01:53.381 --> 01:54.448
What's with the measuring?

01:54.482 --> 01:55.883
Well, now that
Barry's off to Penn,

01:55.916 --> 01:58.752
I'm gonna turn his room
into my private
toy sanctuary,

01:58.786 --> 02:00.954
where I can display
all my collectible
action figures.

02:00.988 --> 02:02.055
Oh, no, you won't.

02:02.089 --> 02:03.257
I have to!

02:03.291 --> 02:06.294
Displaying collectibles
is how adult boys
play with toys.

02:06.327 --> 02:08.829
Barry's room will always stay
exactly the same,

02:08.862 --> 02:09.930
so that, at any moment,

02:09.963 --> 02:12.065
I can come in
and sniff his pillowcases

02:12.099 --> 02:13.467
and pretend that
nothing's changed.

02:13.501 --> 02:15.469
So, basically,
it's a shrine that supports

02:15.503 --> 02:17.605
your wildly
unhealthy attachment
to your children?

02:17.638 --> 02:19.740
You want to turn this
into a toy museum,

02:19.773 --> 02:21.209
so who's
the weird one here?

02:21.242 --> 02:22.310
Mom gets it.

02:22.343 --> 02:24.512
One day,
people will pay a fortune

02:24.545 --> 02:27.448
to see where America's
first doctoring
rap president grew up.

02:27.481 --> 02:29.250
Oh, they sure will.

02:29.283 --> 02:31.919
Oh, I can't believe my baby's
done high school!

02:31.952 --> 02:33.987
It really is the end
of an era, Ad Rock.

02:34.021 --> 02:35.456
Which is why
I have to give you

02:35.489 --> 02:37.458
as many joxygen masks
as possible.

02:37.491 --> 02:39.460
Wait, what?
Sweet balls, no!

02:39.493 --> 02:42.730
Aww, my babies love each other
so friggin' much. Oh!

02:42.763 --> 02:44.498
Oh, terrible!

02:44.532 --> 02:46.667
I know, buddy.
I'm gonna miss this, too.

02:46.700 --> 02:47.801
Ohh!

02:47.835 --> 02:49.136
* I don't know the future

02:49.169 --> 02:52.373
* But the past keeps getting
clearer every day *

02:53.807 --> 02:55.776
ADULT ADAM:
It was May 8th,
1980-something,

02:55.809 --> 02:58.145
and Geoff had a bombshell
to drop on my sister.

02:58.178 --> 02:59.747
Erica, oh,
sweet lord, Erica.

02:59.780 --> 03:01.114
I just got
the worst news ever.

03:01.148 --> 03:02.250
Oh, my God!
What is it?

03:02.283 --> 03:03.751
Did something happen
to your family?
Worse!

03:03.784 --> 03:05.586
I have the highest GPA
in my graduating class,

03:05.619 --> 03:06.654
and I'm valedictorian.

03:06.687 --> 03:08.856
Damn it, Geoff.
You scared the crap out of me.

03:08.889 --> 03:10.157
You should be scared.

03:10.190 --> 03:12.326
I now have to write
a moving graduation speech.

03:12.360 --> 03:13.661
Do you have any idea
what happens

03:13.694 --> 03:15.363
when I have to speak
in a public forum?

03:15.396 --> 03:17.331
Yes, you get slight
performance anxiety...

03:17.365 --> 03:19.032
Crippling stage fright.
Crippling stage fright.

03:19.066 --> 03:20.501
I didn't want to say it,
but that's what it is.

03:20.534 --> 03:23.203
I know, and having to write
a speech on top
of everything else

03:23.237 --> 03:25.673
completely implodes
my jam-packed
Filofax schedule.

03:25.706 --> 03:27.207
What the hell am I looking at
right now?

03:27.241 --> 03:28.842
My summer broken down
and planned to the minute.

03:28.876 --> 03:32.012
Dude, you have two jobs
and five summer school classes

03:32.045 --> 03:33.681
and an internship
at LensCrafters.

03:33.714 --> 03:35.148
Not enough?
It's more than enough.

03:35.182 --> 03:36.950
You even scheduled
bathroom breaks.

03:36.984 --> 03:38.619
It's either Wednesdays at 4:00
or not at all.

03:38.652 --> 03:40.120
Dude, you're already
valedictorian.

03:40.153 --> 03:41.889
What more do you want?
So much more.

03:41.922 --> 03:43.123
This summer,
I have to complete

03:43.156 --> 03:44.525
all my college core classes

03:44.558 --> 03:46.727
so that next year, I have time
to pick a sensible major

03:46.760 --> 03:48.629
so that I can get a job
and then marry you

03:48.662 --> 03:50.398
and then buy a house
and then lease a Volvo

03:50.431 --> 03:52.132
and then save for our kids
to go to college.

03:52.165 --> 03:53.367
Forget our kids' college!

03:53.401 --> 03:54.802
You haven't even
gone to college.

03:54.835 --> 03:56.570
I know.
I'm sorry I'm so wound up.

03:56.604 --> 03:58.839
It's just our future is, like,
super important to me.

03:58.872 --> 04:00.173
Whoa, what's with
all the scratching?

04:00.207 --> 04:01.342
It's just a stress rash.

04:01.375 --> 04:02.843
It comes and goes
like my peptic ulcer.

04:02.876 --> 04:04.378
Who's ready to fill
their tum-tums

04:04.412 --> 04:05.513
with some Ants on a Log?

04:05.546 --> 04:06.747
Not this guy.

04:06.780 --> 04:07.981
He's so stressed
about his future,

04:08.015 --> 04:09.149
he's all itchy
and rashy.

04:09.182 --> 04:11.352
Oh, poor baby.
Here, let me see...

04:11.385 --> 04:12.553
Oh, son of a bitch!

04:12.586 --> 04:14.021
Erica, step away
from that boy

04:14.054 --> 04:15.222
and go wash your hands.
What?

04:15.255 --> 04:17.691
Geoffrey has a scorching case
of the shingles.

04:17.725 --> 04:18.859
Shingles? No!

04:18.892 --> 04:20.494
Isn't that a virus
for sad, old people?

04:20.528 --> 04:21.629
Oh, for sure.

04:21.662 --> 04:23.664
But it's also brought on
by overwhelming stress.

04:23.697 --> 04:26.166
I have overwhelming stress!
That describes me perfectly!

04:26.199 --> 04:27.401
Geoff, look at me.

04:27.435 --> 04:29.570
I'm telling you
as an absolute fact

04:29.603 --> 04:30.938
you don't have
the shingles.

04:30.971 --> 04:32.072
Geoff has the shingles.

04:32.105 --> 04:33.541
What? Is he okay?

04:33.574 --> 04:35.743
No, I'm not okay!
I'm soaking
in a tub of oatmeal!

04:35.776 --> 04:38.379
Just stay in the healing
breakfast bath, son!

04:38.412 --> 04:39.547
Doctor's orders!

04:39.580 --> 04:41.248
Please stop standing
outside the door!

04:41.281 --> 04:43.250
This bath is delicious
and humiliating!

04:43.283 --> 04:45.118
ADULT ADAM: As Geoff soaked
in his mushy bath,

04:45.152 --> 04:46.454
I was facing
the cold hard facts

04:46.487 --> 04:48.188
about my girlfriend
graduating.

04:48.221 --> 04:50.358
I can't believe we only have
one week left together.

04:50.391 --> 04:52.225
Ba-bup!
We agreed

04:52.259 --> 04:54.027
you going off to college was
gonna be drama-free.

04:54.061 --> 04:55.596
I know we said it,
but how?

04:55.629 --> 04:57.631
Jackie, we fell
in magical nerd love,

04:57.665 --> 04:58.966
and that lasts forever.

04:58.999 --> 05:00.701
We'll always be
in each other's lives.

05:00.734 --> 05:02.870
Promise?
Look at me and know this.

05:02.903 --> 05:04.338
I will always...

05:07.508 --> 05:09.142
(LAUGHTER)

05:09.777 --> 05:10.978
Aw, man.

05:11.011 --> 05:12.446
So glad I got
another year of this.

05:12.480 --> 05:15.816
Gah! I was having a special
moment with my special lady!

05:15.849 --> 05:18.619
And now I'm having
a special moment with you.

05:18.652 --> 05:20.821
Jackie, do you mind?
You're bordering on rude!

05:20.854 --> 05:22.923
I'll see you at lunch, Ad.

05:22.956 --> 05:24.892
My God, I can't wait
till you're gone

05:24.925 --> 05:27.060
and I don't have to deal
with your stupidity anymore.

05:27.094 --> 05:29.129
(SIGHS) I feel the same way,
little buddy.

05:29.162 --> 05:30.297
So, what do you say?

05:30.330 --> 05:32.466
One more for old time's sake?
One more what?

05:32.500 --> 05:33.767
ADAM: Hello?

05:33.801 --> 05:35.969
Anyone? Hello?

05:36.003 --> 05:38.506
It's dark in here,
and I've lost
all sense of time.

05:39.139 --> 05:40.408
(GROANS)

05:40.441 --> 05:42.976
Mr. Goldberg,
you're way too big and old

05:43.010 --> 05:44.445
to be playing
in the lockers.

05:44.478 --> 05:45.646
Playing?

05:45.679 --> 05:46.847
My stupid brother Barry

05:46.880 --> 05:48.281
impressively crammed me
in there.

05:48.315 --> 05:50.651
Good news for many is,
he's graduating.

05:50.684 --> 05:51.785
He's moving on.

05:51.819 --> 05:52.986
Thank God, but how?

05:53.020 --> 05:55.523
You pass your classes,
you do your community service,

05:55.556 --> 05:57.124
boom, done.

05:57.157 --> 06:00.027
To be honest, you just got
to keep the herd moving.

06:00.060 --> 06:02.362
Clearly.
Barry didn't even do any.

06:02.396 --> 06:05.699
So, you're saying Barry did
no community service at all?

06:05.733 --> 06:08.035
(LAUGHS NERVOUSLY)
I was... I was just kidding.

06:08.068 --> 06:11.939
Um, Barry actually organized
a community soup

06:11.972 --> 06:14.174
garden 10k run

06:14.207 --> 06:16.944
for food and, also,
blood and shoes.

06:16.977 --> 06:18.145
And comfort dogs.

06:18.178 --> 06:19.480
That's clearly not real.

06:19.513 --> 06:20.614
Clearly.

06:20.648 --> 06:22.450
Please do me a solid,
and let's just pretend like

06:22.483 --> 06:23.817
this conversation
never happened.

06:23.851 --> 06:26.386
Or do me a solid
and tell your brother

06:26.420 --> 06:28.989
if he doesn't complete
100 hours of
community service

06:29.022 --> 06:32.159
in the next four days,
he doesn't get his diploma.

06:35.663 --> 06:36.897
How's Geoffrey feeling?

06:36.930 --> 06:38.999
Like his body has
been ravaged by shingles.

06:39.032 --> 06:40.300
(BREATHES SHARPLY)

06:40.333 --> 06:41.669
That is wonderful news!

06:41.702 --> 06:44.505
The sooner I ask,
the sooner I can
start regretting asking...

06:44.538 --> 06:46.540
Why is Geoff's pain
wonderful news?

06:46.574 --> 06:48.576
You've locked down
every yenta's dream.

06:48.609 --> 06:50.844
A man so concerned
with your future

06:50.878 --> 06:52.345
that he's made
himself sick.

06:52.379 --> 06:54.081
And why exactly
is that good?

06:54.114 --> 06:56.717
He loves you so much
he's willing to do anything

06:56.750 --> 06:58.318
to provide for you.

06:58.351 --> 07:00.087
Of course,
his stress rashes
will continue,

07:00.120 --> 07:01.689
and all his hair
will fall out,

07:01.722 --> 07:04.992
and his tired body will break
till he forms a widow's hump.

07:05.025 --> 07:08.028
Ew. I don't want a rashy
bald hunchback for a husband.

07:08.061 --> 07:09.329
You'd be so lucky.

07:09.362 --> 07:12.232
Every day, I thank God
that I have a man

07:12.265 --> 07:13.834
who would exhaust himself

07:13.867 --> 07:15.603
into that...
(SNORES)

07:15.636 --> 07:17.605
...for me
and this family.

07:17.638 --> 07:20.273
Murray, don't eat
Ritz crackers
in your sleep!

07:20.307 --> 07:22.510
You'll choke to death!
Where were we?

07:22.543 --> 07:24.277
We were just wrapping up
your positive spin

07:24.311 --> 07:26.446
on having to watch
your husband breathe.

07:26.480 --> 07:27.915
Enjoy the rest
of your day.

07:27.948 --> 07:31.151
What? (MUTTERING)

07:34.321 --> 07:36.123
Hey, dude.
What's all this?

07:36.156 --> 07:38.125
Oh, I'm spending the summer
following the Grateful Dead,

07:38.158 --> 07:39.459
so I'm loading up
on some GORP.

07:39.493 --> 07:40.728
GORP?
"GORP."

07:40.761 --> 07:42.563
Stands for
"good old raisins
and peanuts."

07:42.596 --> 07:44.064
It's the go-to meal
for Deadheads.

07:44.097 --> 07:46.433
So, you're basically
living in a van,
eating crappy trail mix?

07:46.466 --> 07:48.401
Totally.
Bad news, bro.

07:48.435 --> 07:50.437
I ate all my GORP.
You ate all your GORP?

07:50.470 --> 07:51.872
That was supposed to last
all summer!

07:51.905 --> 07:54.107
Coach says we grow
from setbacks,
so this will be good.

07:54.141 --> 07:57.044
Wait, Ruben Amaro Jr.
is following the Dead
with you?

07:57.077 --> 07:58.111
I was gonna train
all summer

07:58.145 --> 08:00.213
because that's what it takes
to go pro, but, man,

08:00.247 --> 08:02.049
I was putting so much stress
and pressure on myself,

08:02.082 --> 08:03.884
I was doing crunches
in my sleep.

08:03.917 --> 08:05.285
The only crunching
we do in my van

08:05.318 --> 08:06.453
is on some sweet GORP.

08:06.486 --> 08:08.589
Lucky for me,
Ruben Amaro Sr. was like,

08:08.622 --> 08:12.292
"Hey, Ruben Amaro Jr.,
Forget the future.
Focus on the now."

08:12.325 --> 08:14.427
See, that's exactly what
my mom doesn't get.

08:14.461 --> 08:17.765
Geoff needs a summer around
spaced-out oddballs in tie-dye

08:17.798 --> 08:19.432
making irresponsible
life choices.

08:19.466 --> 08:20.801
Well, if you want
to see the country

08:20.834 --> 08:22.002
in the luxury of
an un-air-conditioned van,

08:22.035 --> 08:23.170
we got room for two more.

08:26.439 --> 08:28.475
Geoff, stop whatever
dumb smart thing
you're doing.

08:28.508 --> 08:30.310
Dumb?
It's my valedictorian speech.

08:30.343 --> 08:32.112
And, oh, God,
I'm so behind schedule!

08:32.145 --> 08:33.681
Let me see.

08:34.447 --> 08:35.649
My Filofax!

08:35.683 --> 08:37.484
Well, put this
in your Filofax.

08:37.517 --> 08:38.986
You and me are gonna
spend the summer

08:39.019 --> 08:40.821
following the Grateful Dead.
Wait, what?

08:40.854 --> 08:42.422
Look, this year
was so hard,

08:42.455 --> 08:43.857
and you got me
through it.

08:43.891 --> 08:45.458
So now it's my turn
to help you,

08:45.492 --> 08:47.260
and I won't take no
for an answer.
Yes!

08:47.294 --> 08:49.830
Thank you for freeing me
from my Filofax!
Let's do this!

08:49.863 --> 08:51.665
For sure! I mean,
it's the Grateful Dead.

08:51.699 --> 08:52.766
Yeah, people love them.

08:52.800 --> 08:54.501
They do.
I mean, I don't.

08:54.534 --> 08:56.303
Me neither!
But they do have
that one song.

08:56.336 --> 08:57.838
Exactly.
That one's okay.

08:57.871 --> 08:59.172
It's kind of okay.
It's okay enough.

08:59.206 --> 09:01.008
Yes! We are going
to follow a band

09:01.041 --> 09:02.610
we have mixed feelings about,
but who cares?

09:02.643 --> 09:04.344
'Cause I get a break
from being me.

09:05.012 --> 09:06.079
(SCREAMS)
Shingles!

09:06.113 --> 09:07.881
I'll go stir you up
a breakfast bath.
Uh-huh.

09:07.915 --> 09:09.983
ADULT ADAM: As Geoff bailed
on his big speech,

09:10.017 --> 09:12.052
it was time for me
to face my big brother.

09:12.085 --> 09:13.220
Barry, I got
to tell you something.

09:13.253 --> 09:14.655
I got to tell you
something, too.

09:14.688 --> 09:15.723
Mine's bad, so me first.

09:15.756 --> 09:17.825
No, trust me.
Mine's way worse.

09:17.858 --> 09:20.027
So shut your face
and sit down.

09:20.060 --> 09:21.829
I've realized
something huge today

09:21.862 --> 09:23.964
when I went back
to the locker
I stuffed you in.

09:23.997 --> 09:26.233
To let me out?
To fart through the air vents.

09:26.266 --> 09:27.334
But you were gone

09:27.367 --> 09:28.501
and then it hit me.

09:28.535 --> 09:30.337
Somehow Matt Bradley
was right.

09:30.370 --> 09:31.672
(SLOW MUSIC PLAYS)
All these years,

09:31.705 --> 09:34.074
I've been wedging underwear
in your butt crack

09:34.107 --> 09:36.309
when I should have been
wedging love

09:36.343 --> 09:37.510
in your heart crack.

09:37.544 --> 09:39.179
Which is why
I need you to know

09:39.212 --> 09:42.015
I love you, bro,
with all my heart.

09:42.049 --> 09:44.517
Ooh, wow.
(MUSIC DISTORTS, STOPS)

09:44.551 --> 09:47.487
This is super bad timing.
Here's the thing.

09:47.520 --> 09:49.790
I told the principal that
you never did
your community service,

09:49.823 --> 09:51.892
which means you can't graduate
until you make up the hours,

09:51.925 --> 09:53.493
which is impossible,
given the time frame.

09:53.526 --> 09:55.395
What?
So I can't graduate?

09:55.428 --> 09:56.563
Calm down.

09:56.596 --> 09:57.731
I'll help you find a way

09:57.765 --> 09:59.332
to do your community service
this week.

09:59.366 --> 10:02.502
I owe 100 hours, dude!
Doesn't matter.

10:02.535 --> 10:04.872
We've gotten out of
bigger jams than this.
When?

10:04.905 --> 10:07.040
I helped you win
the talent show with Kara-te,

10:07.074 --> 10:09.242
and we rapped to Beastie Boys
at the pep rally,

10:09.276 --> 10:11.011
and we wrote our own
kick-ass version

10:11.044 --> 10:12.412
of We Didn't Start The Fire!

10:12.445 --> 10:13.546
We have worked well
together.

10:13.580 --> 10:15.716
We just have to plan
a blowout charity event,

10:15.749 --> 10:17.517
like in the movies.
Yes!

10:17.550 --> 10:19.920
Use your stupid love of movies
to save me.

10:19.953 --> 10:22.022
ADULT ADAM:
Yes, the movies,
and there was only one

10:22.055 --> 10:25.325
logical choice guaranteed
to get Barry out of this jam.

10:25.358 --> 10:26.593
Are you familiar
with the movie

10:26.626 --> 10:28.228
Breakin' 2:
Electric Boogaloo?

10:28.261 --> 10:31.264
ADULT ADAM: Yep, the '80s
didn't just give us
sick break-dancing moves.

10:31.298 --> 10:33.767
It gave us even sicker
break-dancing movies.

10:33.801 --> 10:36.904
What if there was a way
I could host
a charity fundraiser

10:36.937 --> 10:41.608
that is guaranteed to raise
$30,000 in one night?

10:41.641 --> 10:44.377
That's right.
We're uniting all
the greatest break-dancers

10:44.411 --> 10:45.445
from all the greatest

10:45.478 --> 10:47.047
break-dancing movies
ever released.

10:47.080 --> 10:48.882
There's only four,
but we're gonna get

10:48.916 --> 10:50.350
the best of those
nine guys.

10:50.383 --> 10:52.219
We're talking the boys
from Breakin',

10:52.252 --> 10:53.754
the crew from
Krush Groove,

10:53.787 --> 10:56.323
the pop-'n'-lock posse
from Beat Street.

10:56.356 --> 10:58.091
You can deliver
the cardboard gymnasts

10:58.125 --> 10:59.359
from Beat Street?

10:59.392 --> 11:01.594
No, that's where
Ms. Cinoman comes in.
It's true, Earl.

11:01.628 --> 11:04.431
Many moons ago, I spent
three passionate weeks

11:04.464 --> 11:06.333
with a physically expressive
young dancer

11:06.366 --> 11:07.467
by the name of Turbo.

11:07.500 --> 11:08.969
Turbo?

11:09.002 --> 11:11.538
You mean
the lead street stylist
of the movie Breakin'?

11:11.571 --> 11:13.841
Indeed.
Even though
it's wildly upsetting

11:13.874 --> 11:17.177
that teachers have lives
outside these hallways,

11:17.210 --> 11:21.381
we have access to Turbo,
which means we have everyone.

11:21.414 --> 11:22.615
If you can pull this off,

11:22.649 --> 11:25.352
the community service hours
you owe will be fulfilled.

11:25.385 --> 11:28.055
If we get Turbo,
the rest will follow.

11:29.156 --> 11:31.024
Mostly because
they don't work a lot.

11:31.058 --> 11:32.926
ADULT ADAM:
Erica was gearing up
to dance the summer away

11:32.960 --> 11:34.194
with the Grateful Dead,

11:34.227 --> 11:35.963
but not everyone was
feeling the music.

11:35.996 --> 11:37.497
There is no way
I'm gonna let you

11:37.530 --> 11:39.499
ramble around the country
all summer in a van!

11:39.532 --> 11:42.202
And all for some stupid
hippie music!

11:42.235 --> 11:44.537
Do you both realize
how much I hate hippies?

11:44.571 --> 11:47.374
Are you happy?
You just got your father
all worked up about hippies.

11:47.407 --> 11:50.210
To be clear, I'm not asking.
I'm telling.

11:50.243 --> 11:52.345
I'm an adult who no longer
needs your permission.

11:52.379 --> 11:53.413
Peace.

11:53.446 --> 11:56.449
How dare you use
logic and facts
against us?

11:56.483 --> 11:58.318
Stupid hippies!
Damn it, Murray.

11:58.351 --> 12:00.620
You stopped listening
the minute you heard
the word "hippie."

12:00.653 --> 12:02.722
I did. What did I miss?
It's fine.

12:02.756 --> 12:04.524
Erica may not listen
to her parents,

12:04.557 --> 12:07.795
but Geoff is a good boy
who always listens to his.

12:07.828 --> 12:10.197
Howdy.
Peace, love.

12:10.230 --> 12:11.899
What the hell is
on your bodies right now?

12:11.932 --> 12:13.901
This is what you call
a tied-dye.

12:13.934 --> 12:15.836
Geoff made it for us in a tub
in the backyard.

12:15.869 --> 12:18.305
So, I take it Geoff told you
about the silly road trip?

12:18.338 --> 12:19.506
Actually, it was Erica,

12:19.539 --> 12:21.241
and we think
it's a wonderful idea.

12:21.274 --> 12:23.210
'Sup? All I had to do
to convince them

12:23.243 --> 12:25.312
that Geoff needed a break
was show them his Filofax.

12:25.345 --> 12:28.215
You live your life
to the fullest
this summer, boichik.

12:28.248 --> 12:30.750
Do it for all
the stressed-out Schwartz men

12:30.784 --> 12:32.185
who came before you.

12:32.219 --> 12:34.888
Erica, the nerve of you
going behind my back

12:34.922 --> 12:36.423
before I went behind yours!

12:36.456 --> 12:39.392
ADULT ADAM: And so,
Erica's summer on the road
was still trucking.

12:39.426 --> 12:41.028
As for me and my brother,
we were on the road

12:41.061 --> 12:42.195
to break-dancing glory.

12:42.229 --> 12:43.430
What's this, gentlemen?

12:43.463 --> 12:45.232
It's the classic
break-dance movie

12:45.265 --> 12:46.867
fundraising thermometer.

12:46.900 --> 12:49.102
It tells the audience
how much money we raised

12:49.136 --> 12:50.537
to save
our community center

12:50.570 --> 12:52.039
or, in this case,
my diploma.

12:52.072 --> 12:54.041
By chance, did you spend
any of the last few days

12:54.074 --> 12:55.642
practicing actual
break-dancing

12:55.675 --> 12:57.277
instead of building
the giant thermometer?

12:57.310 --> 12:58.812
Nah, we're gonna leave
that magic up

12:58.846 --> 13:00.713
to your intimate pal Turbo
and his friends.

13:00.747 --> 13:01.915
Don't get me wrong.

13:01.949 --> 13:04.952
I am a way better break-dancer
than all those fools combined,

13:04.985 --> 13:06.119
but I don't want
to show them up.

13:06.153 --> 13:07.754
Well, great news.

13:07.787 --> 13:09.356
Now you get the chance
to shine

13:09.389 --> 13:11.091
because none of those
world-famous break-dancers

13:11.124 --> 13:12.292
will be joining us tonight.

13:12.325 --> 13:13.560
What?
But you said,

13:13.593 --> 13:15.462
if we got Turbo,
the rest will follow.

13:15.495 --> 13:18.465
Turns out the man I had
a dalliance with that summer

13:18.498 --> 13:20.968
was not, in fact,
Turbo from Breakin' 2.

13:21.001 --> 13:22.970
It has been confirmed
via phone

13:23.003 --> 13:24.905
that his name
is actually D'Andre,

13:24.938 --> 13:26.106
and he's a liar.

13:26.139 --> 13:28.641
Does D'Andre know Turbo?

13:28.675 --> 13:30.911
He does not.
Oh, balls!

13:30.944 --> 13:32.279
This is all your fault!

13:32.312 --> 13:35.048
No, no.
It's just a setback,
but like always,

13:35.082 --> 13:36.449
we'll win over
the crowd.

13:36.483 --> 13:37.817
So, take my hand

13:37.851 --> 13:39.953
and do the wave
like you've never waved before

13:39.987 --> 13:41.922
'cause this right here,
right now,

13:41.955 --> 13:43.590
is our last great
high-school adventure.

13:43.623 --> 13:44.657
You're right!

13:44.691 --> 13:46.726
Time to fill up
that cardboard thermometer

13:46.759 --> 13:49.262
with $30,000.

13:49.296 --> 13:52.432
ADULT ADAM:
My last adventure with Barry
would be the stuff of legend.

13:52.465 --> 13:55.435
As for Erica and Geoff,
their first road trip
was about to hit a detour.

13:55.468 --> 13:56.503
JOHNNY: 'Sup, bozos?

13:56.536 --> 13:58.805
I'm off to follow Rush
around Canada this summer,

13:58.838 --> 14:00.740
and your hot mom offered
to make me homemade BORP.

14:00.773 --> 14:02.342
BORP?
I thought it was GORP?

14:02.375 --> 14:04.811
No, this is BORP.

14:04.844 --> 14:06.779
Beverly's Ol' Raisins
and Peanuts.

14:06.813 --> 14:10.017
I also added M&M'S,
caramel chips,
and Skittles.

14:10.050 --> 14:11.351
That goes against
everything

14:11.384 --> 14:13.086
that a good, healthy GORP
stands for!

14:13.120 --> 14:14.454
What's your game,
woman?

14:14.487 --> 14:15.788
No game.

14:15.822 --> 14:18.358
But, hey, since
your friend's here,

14:18.391 --> 14:20.961
why doesn't he tell Geoff
what van life is like?

14:20.994 --> 14:23.163
In a word, chaos.

14:23.196 --> 14:24.764
Oh, no! That's my least
favorite word!

14:24.797 --> 14:27.167
Dude, my mom's just trying
to scare you.
It'll be fine.

14:27.200 --> 14:28.435
It will not be fine.

14:28.468 --> 14:30.003
Every day,
you face a new disaster...
No.

14:30.037 --> 14:32.139
...like flat tires
and traffic jams

14:32.172 --> 14:34.507
and petty theft
and motorcycle gangs
and snakes.

14:34.541 --> 14:36.543
Oh, no! Snakes and also,
all the other things
you said!

14:36.576 --> 14:38.311
Tell them about
the bathrooms, Johnny.

14:38.345 --> 14:40.180
This bad boy goes
where I go.

14:40.213 --> 14:41.281
I'm out. Can't do it.

14:41.314 --> 14:43.050
Trust me,
this is a good thing.

14:43.083 --> 14:44.684
Not the poop shovel,
but the road trip.

14:44.717 --> 14:45.752
You need this.

14:45.785 --> 14:47.154
I can't do it, Erica.

14:47.187 --> 14:48.488
I know you said
I shouldn't stress

14:48.521 --> 14:50.223
about our future,
but I do.

14:50.257 --> 14:51.558
This is who I am.

14:51.591 --> 14:53.560
I gotta go
write my speech.

14:53.593 --> 14:56.196
I know you're hopping mad,
but you gotta trust Mama.

14:56.229 --> 14:57.330
This is for the best.

14:57.364 --> 14:58.565
Not for Geoff.

14:58.598 --> 15:01.034
I wish you could stop being
so selfish and see that.

15:01.068 --> 15:02.970
Schmoopaloo!

15:03.003 --> 15:04.671
Thanks again
for the BORP, Mrs. G.

15:04.704 --> 15:06.506
I can tell it's made
with love by a hot mom.

15:06.539 --> 15:08.475
ADULT ADAM:
As my smother finally
shut down Erica,

15:08.508 --> 15:10.377
we were pumping up
the crowd.

15:10.410 --> 15:12.145
It was our last great
high-school adventure,

15:12.179 --> 15:13.546
and just like in Breakin' 2,

15:13.580 --> 15:16.183
our charity fundraiser
would easily save the day.

15:16.216 --> 15:18.118
Breakin'...
2!

15:18.151 --> 15:19.419
BOTH: Electric Boogaloo!

15:19.452 --> 15:20.553
ADULT ADAM: Or not.

15:20.587 --> 15:22.489
Barry kind of did the worm.

15:22.522 --> 15:24.324
I sort of did the windmill.

15:24.357 --> 15:27.294
And we both did
whatever this is.

15:28.128 --> 15:30.597
How exactly
did you date him
after me?

15:30.630 --> 15:32.432
Hey, we're like
soul mates.

15:34.467 --> 15:36.836
But, yeah, I kind of wish
I had graduated
before this happened.

15:36.869 --> 15:38.105
ADULT ADAM:
Thankfully, no one seemed

15:38.138 --> 15:39.772
to notice the absence
of Turbo.
Ow!

15:39.806 --> 15:41.941
Where's Turbo?
We were promised Turbo!

15:41.975 --> 15:43.910
AUDIENCE: (CHANTING)
Turbo! Turbo! Turbo!

15:43.943 --> 15:45.112
(GROANS)

15:45.145 --> 15:47.047
It's charity
having to look at this!

15:47.080 --> 15:49.582
At what point
do we win them over,
like we always do?

15:49.616 --> 15:51.951
We don't!
Our last adventure's
an utter failure!

15:51.985 --> 15:53.420
Break-dance retreat!

15:53.453 --> 15:55.288
ADULT ADAM:
And so we roboted to safety,

15:55.322 --> 15:58.391
having raised a whopping
$3 for charity,

15:58.425 --> 15:59.759
but maybe it would be enough.

15:59.792 --> 16:01.328
You promised Turbo.

16:01.361 --> 16:02.429
ADULT ADAM: It was not.

16:02.462 --> 16:04.297
You can walk at graduation,

16:04.331 --> 16:05.898
but you don't
actually graduate

16:05.932 --> 16:07.700
till that community service
is done.

16:07.734 --> 16:09.669
(GROANING) Aw.

16:09.702 --> 16:11.438
ADULT ADAM:
Now that my mom
had put the brakes

16:11.471 --> 16:12.672
on my sister's road trip,

16:12.705 --> 16:15.275
Geoff was back to gearing up
for his graduation speech.

16:15.308 --> 16:16.809
Hey, Mrs. G.
Erica around?

16:16.843 --> 16:18.745
I wouldn't know.
She's not speaking to me.

16:18.778 --> 16:20.413
Yeah, she's not exactly
pleased with me either

16:20.447 --> 16:22.082
since I bailed
on our van trip.

16:22.115 --> 16:23.483
But I was really hoping
she'd give me

16:23.516 --> 16:24.684
some notes on my speech.

16:24.717 --> 16:26.386
Well, if you want
a painfully honest,

16:26.419 --> 16:28.655
no-holds-barred opinion,
I'm right here.

16:28.688 --> 16:30.790
ADULT ADAM:
Since my mom was the one
that put Geoff back on track,

16:30.823 --> 16:32.892
she knew it was her job
to help him.

16:32.925 --> 16:35.795
Webster's Dictionary defines
"Webster" as a sitcom

16:35.828 --> 16:37.997
about an adorable,
pocket-sized boy.

16:38.031 --> 16:39.032
Hold for laughter.

16:40.333 --> 16:42.902
You know, if there's
one thing that this school's
done for me,

16:42.935 --> 16:45.605
it's (SNORTS) helped me
find my voice.

16:45.638 --> 16:46.706
My throat is dry.

16:48.041 --> 16:50.143
In the immortal words
of Mahatma Gandhi,

16:50.177 --> 16:52.312
is it me
or is it hot in here?

16:52.345 --> 16:53.613
Gandhi did not said that.

16:53.646 --> 16:55.982
I said that because
I'm drenched in fear
right now.

16:56.015 --> 16:57.384
Although he could
have said that.

16:57.417 --> 16:59.319
We don't know.
He was hot in India.

16:59.352 --> 17:02.989
So, in conclusion, I ask you,
do you see floating spots?

17:03.022 --> 17:05.392
'Cause there's, like,
so many.

17:05.425 --> 17:07.094
(THUDS)
Any notes?

17:07.127 --> 17:09.796
Erica Goldberg, get down here!
It's an emergency!

17:09.829 --> 17:11.498
Oh, no!
Get away from the boy!

17:11.531 --> 17:13.100
It's okay.
She was just
giving me notes.

17:13.133 --> 17:14.767
And here it is.

17:14.801 --> 17:16.369
Take this sack of stress,

17:16.403 --> 17:18.371
pull him into
that disgusting van,

17:18.405 --> 17:20.707
and follow
those hippies around
for the whole summer.

17:20.740 --> 17:22.842
Are you serious?
You were right.

17:22.875 --> 17:24.211
If you really love someone,

17:24.244 --> 17:26.579
you've got to do
everything you can
to make them happy.

17:26.613 --> 17:27.780
Well, then, screw it.

17:27.814 --> 17:29.349
I'm gonna go pack some clothes
and buy a potty shovel.

17:29.382 --> 17:30.650
But what about
your speech?

17:30.683 --> 17:31.951
Someone else can give it!

17:31.984 --> 17:33.052
I'm going to see the Dead,

17:33.086 --> 17:34.521
and I'm sort of
excited about it.

17:34.554 --> 17:36.889
ADULT ADAM: In the end,
my mom did help Geoff.

17:36.923 --> 17:38.057
And that graduation day,

17:38.091 --> 17:41.161
he finally wasn't so scared
about the future.

17:41.194 --> 17:43.363
Thank you, Quakers Dozen.

17:43.396 --> 17:45.365
ADULT ADAM: But for Barry,
a graduation with no diploma

17:45.398 --> 17:46.466
was less than thrilling.

17:46.499 --> 17:48.034
Normally, this is the point

17:48.067 --> 17:50.870
where we ask our valedictorian
to speak,

17:50.903 --> 17:52.705
but he has instead decided

17:52.739 --> 17:54.974
to follow the Grateful Dead
in a van.

17:55.007 --> 17:58.077
Whoo!
Thank you, Goldbergs!
Hi, Erica!

17:58.111 --> 18:00.980
So, for the first time in
William Penn's
storied history,

18:01.013 --> 18:03.150
we have no valedictory speech.

18:03.183 --> 18:05.352
Not so fast!
I got tons of stuff
to say.

18:05.385 --> 18:06.553
Ah. (BLEEP)

18:06.586 --> 18:08.821
Mr. Goldberg, there is
absolutely no world

18:08.855 --> 18:10.223
in which I would let you
touch the mic...

18:10.257 --> 18:13.593
Thank you for those
kind words, sir.

18:13.626 --> 18:15.162
Oh, this just got good.

18:15.195 --> 18:17.664
Welcome, parents,
fellow students,

18:17.697 --> 18:20.133
esteemed faculty, JTP.

18:20.167 --> 18:21.234
ALL: JTP.

18:21.268 --> 18:22.435
I'm Barry Goldberg.

18:22.469 --> 18:23.770
You might know me
from the time

18:23.803 --> 18:26.273
my mom bodyslammed me
at a wrestling tournament.

18:26.306 --> 18:27.440
(GRUNTS)

18:27.474 --> 18:28.841
Or when
I showed up to school

18:28.875 --> 18:30.277
dressed as Boy George.

18:32.078 --> 18:35.014
Or last night when I put on
a break-dancing show

18:35.047 --> 18:36.949
that had some
very mixed reviews.

18:38.551 --> 18:42.088
But that's the amazing thing
about this school.

18:42.121 --> 18:43.890
Every time I fell,

18:43.923 --> 18:46.559
there was always someone
there to pick me up.

18:46.593 --> 18:49.229
I learned a lot here,
but mostly,

18:49.262 --> 18:53.099
this place taught me
to never be afraid to fail,

18:53.132 --> 18:56.469
and I know everyone sitting
behind me feels the same way.

18:56.503 --> 18:59.739
CHOIR:
* Well, we know
where we're going... *

18:59.772 --> 19:01.441
Would you look at that?

19:01.474 --> 19:03.310
Our moron did good.

19:03.343 --> 19:05.378
Well, I'd say that speech
was some of the best

19:05.412 --> 19:06.979
community service
I've ever seen.

19:07.013 --> 19:09.916
(CHUCKLES)
Go join your classmates.

19:09.949 --> 19:11.984
It's time to get your diploma,
Mr. Goldberg.

19:12.018 --> 19:15.755
* And we're not
little children

19:15.788 --> 19:20.126
* And we know what we want *

19:20.159 --> 19:23.830
ADULT ADAM:
Barry Norman Goldberg,
high-school graduate.

19:23.863 --> 19:25.998
Turns out
my brother was right.

19:26.032 --> 19:27.767
It really was
the end of an era,

19:27.800 --> 19:30.237
and man,
it went by in a flash.

19:30.270 --> 19:33.005
The nerdy love of my life
was about to go off to college

19:33.039 --> 19:35.007
and start a new nerdy life
without me.

19:35.041 --> 19:36.809
As for Barry and his friends,
it seemed like

19:36.843 --> 19:39.078
their high-school adventures
would never end,

19:39.111 --> 19:41.180
but in a blink,
they were all grown up

19:41.214 --> 19:42.615
and ready for the future.

19:42.649 --> 19:44.651
Kind of reminds me
of something
my dad used to say,

19:44.684 --> 19:47.086
"The days are long,
but the years are short."

19:47.119 --> 19:48.755
And watching my brother
and his friends

19:48.788 --> 19:50.156
celebrate on that stage,

19:50.189 --> 19:52.292
I finally understand
what he meant.

19:52.325 --> 19:53.860
I know I always said
I couldn't wait

19:53.893 --> 19:55.161
till Barry left for college,

19:55.194 --> 19:57.063
but the truth is,

19:57.096 --> 19:58.998
he was my best friend,
and I'd miss him.

19:59.666 --> 20:01.133
But that's life.

20:01.167 --> 20:02.669
One era had ended,

20:02.702 --> 20:05.972
but an even better one
was about to begin.

20:06.005 --> 20:08.007
Well, we're off,
but don't worry, sir.

20:08.040 --> 20:10.009
I'll take great care
of her, always.

20:10.042 --> 20:13.145
Yeah, but she'll take
even better care of you.

20:13.179 --> 20:14.847
Got you something
for your trip.

20:14.881 --> 20:15.982
What is this thing?

20:16.015 --> 20:17.650
BEVERLY: It's called a mobile
telephone device.

20:17.684 --> 20:20.152
ADULT ADAM:
That summer, we all grew up
more than we expected.

20:20.186 --> 20:22.054
You're gonna call me
every hour on the hour.

20:22.088 --> 20:24.056
My mom learned to let go
a little bit more.

20:24.090 --> 20:26.259
Erica finally had a plan
to go back to school.

20:26.293 --> 20:29.195
And, for once,
Geoff didn't have
a plan at all.

20:29.228 --> 20:30.863
Let's ride.
(ALL CHEER)

20:30.897 --> 20:33.533
ADULT ADAM: Next year,
we were all headed
into uncharted territory,

20:33.566 --> 20:36.202
but turns out
it'll be the greatest year
of my life.

20:36.235 --> 20:37.670
Of course, when I look back,

20:37.704 --> 20:39.238
I don't always
get the details right,

20:39.272 --> 20:40.407
but there's one thing
I do know.

20:40.440 --> 20:43.776
It was 1980-something,
and it was perfect.

20:48.881 --> 20:49.916
(DINGS)

20:50.617 --> 20:51.918
WOMAN: Comment from Adam?

20:51.951 --> 20:53.219
MAN: Let's focus on that zit.

20:53.252 --> 20:55.722
I wish him, brother...
MAN: Battery's gone dead.

20:55.755 --> 20:57.023
What's all this nerdry?

20:57.056 --> 20:58.190
Jackie's off to college,

20:58.224 --> 20:59.592
so I'm putting together
a care package.

20:59.626 --> 21:01.761
We're being super mature
about her leaving

21:01.794 --> 21:02.929
and taking it as it goes.

21:02.962 --> 21:04.531
That'll never work!

21:04.564 --> 21:07.734
Trust me, what you need
is my foolproof plan

21:07.767 --> 21:09.736
that guarantees
you guys end up together.

21:09.769 --> 21:10.937
Grab a pen.
No.

21:10.970 --> 21:12.505
First, you go
to college pre-med.

21:12.539 --> 21:14.741
Once you graduate,
there's medical school,

21:14.774 --> 21:16.776
an internship, residency,

21:16.809 --> 21:18.945
and, boom,
I'm a radiologist!

21:18.978 --> 21:21.213
At some point
during the 1990s,

21:21.247 --> 21:23.282
you visit her at
her place of business

21:23.316 --> 21:24.551
and wow Lainey

21:24.584 --> 21:26.085
with the impressive adult
you've become.

21:26.118 --> 21:28.455
You just said "Lainey".
This is clearly your plan.

21:28.488 --> 21:30.122
Do you like it?
I think it's half-baked

21:30.156 --> 21:31.491
and highly unlikely
to succeed.
