What a cake!

02:32.472 --> 02:33.921
Make a wish, Santa!

02:40.397 --> 02:43.128
- May l have this dance?
- Why, yes.

03:03.543 --> 03:05.190
Special delivey, Santa.

03:05.336 --> 03:06.473
A gift for me?

03:10.800 --> 03:13.355
Just arrived by North Pole Express.

03:13.553 --> 03:15.421
lt's from the Big Apple.

03:16.181 --> 03:17.390
''Dear Mr Claus:

03:20.226 --> 03:24.606
l regret to inform you of
Mr Hucklebuckle's recent passing.

03:28.109 --> 03:32.853
He explicitly asked me, as his
trusted attorney, to write to you

03:33.699 --> 03:38.276
and thank you for your
Ioyal friendship throughout the years.''

03:39.205 --> 03:39.923
Oh, dear.

03:42.540 --> 03:46.085
''Mr Hucklebuckle enjoyed
passing on your message

03:46.378 --> 03:48.495
to the children of New York.

03:50.215 --> 03:54.178
You taught him the true meaning
of Christmas spirit...

03:55.093 --> 03:57.815
...and the joy of a life of service.

04:00.351 --> 04:04.615
l've sent you the birthday
present from Mr Hucklebuckle...

04:07.357 --> 04:10.453
...that he had hoped
to give you himself.

04:12.778 --> 04:14.613
Sincerely... Mr Stewart.''

04:41.600 --> 04:45.927
Mr Hucklebuckle was a great
ambassador for the Santa Cause.

05:18.719 --> 05:19.074
Wow.

05:20.513 --> 05:21.963
Look at this place.

05:22.304 --> 05:26.247
- It's so nostalgic.
- Yeah, that's one word for it.

05:32.358 --> 05:35.381
l used to spend Christmas here as a kid.

05:37.529 --> 05:38.988
Nothing has changed.

05:39.239 --> 05:40.198
What's this?

05:43.993 --> 05:45.493
ls this a Santa chair?

05:45.494 --> 05:47.579
Grandpa used to
dress up for the kids.

05:47.580 --> 05:51.281
l'm sure the suit is
still around here somewhere.

05:51.376 --> 05:53.995
He loved the whole Christmas season.

06:01.220 --> 06:03.170
Mr Hucklebuckle, l presume.

06:04.513 --> 06:07.673
- l'm Mr Stewart.
- Actually, it's Huckle.

06:08.184 --> 06:09.936
l changed it years ago.

06:10.394 --> 06:12.512
And this must be Mrs Huckle.

06:13.981 --> 06:15.557
Please, call me Kate.

06:16.986 --> 06:19.112
My condolences for your loss.

06:21.114 --> 06:25.283
Your grandfather was more than a client,
he was a dear friend.

06:25.286 --> 06:26.923
l remember him fondly.

06:29.080 --> 06:32.301
So, as we were discussing
on the telephone,

06:32.584 --> 06:37.494
your grandfather left you the key
to the store to do as you wish.

06:38.506 --> 06:41.426
That's good. We're gonna put the
building on the market immediately.

06:41.427 --> 06:43.929
There is, however, one stipulation.

06:48.558 --> 06:53.479
You need to operate the store through
one Christmas season profitably

06:53.480 --> 06:56.034
before the deed can be transferred.

06:58.734 --> 07:01.527
We live in Los Angeles,
Mr Stewart, all right?

07:01.528 --> 07:04.364
And l'm a CPA with
a full roster of clients.

07:04.365 --> 07:06.117
And look at this place.

07:07.075 --> 07:08.952
Here, look at these toys.

07:10.580 --> 07:13.415
Kids don't want to play
with this stuff anymore. It's...

07:13.416 --> 07:14.581
lt's old-fashioned.

07:14.582 --> 07:19.212
Your grandfather used to say that
children's imaginations don't change.

07:19.213 --> 07:20.485
They're timeless.

07:21.006 --> 07:24.134
These toys even remind me
of my childhood.

07:24.135 --> 07:26.846
Back when they didn't
make video games.

07:26.847 --> 07:29.264
We'll keep the store open
through Christmas, Mr Stewart.

07:29.265 --> 07:32.163
Kate, we can't just pick up and leave.

07:33.436 --> 07:37.605
Your grandfather's apartment
on the upper level is open to you.

07:37.606 --> 07:42.216
Plenty of room, and l'm sure
your children will love it here.

07:45.365 --> 07:48.524
We haven't been blessed
with any children.

07:50.120 --> 07:50.891
l'm sory.

07:53.663 --> 07:56.333
l'll be back Christmas Day,
Mr Hucklebuckle.

07:56.334 --> 07:59.253
- Again, it's Huckle.
- Yes, of course.

08:07.261 --> 08:08.356
Happy Holidays.

08:10.805 --> 08:11.901
Mery Christmas.

08:32.035 --> 08:34.745
Don't wory, Quinn.
It'll be vey nice in there.

08:34.746 --> 08:38.134
There'll be other kids
for you to play with.

08:39.167 --> 08:39.825
Come on.

08:46.509 --> 08:46.801
OK.

08:54.557 --> 08:56.257
- Yes?
- Hi, Ms Stout?

08:57.686 --> 08:59.145
l believe you're expecting us.

08:59.146 --> 09:02.440
l'm Mrs Gibson from
Social Services and this...

09:02.441 --> 09:03.347
...is Quinn.

09:04.900 --> 09:07.686
Oh, yes, the new one.
Come right in.

09:15.411 --> 09:19.164
Oh, my. The place could use a little
Christmas cheer, don't you think?

09:19.166 --> 09:21.458
lf l got more money from the state,
maybe l could afford

09:21.459 --> 09:23.356
some Christmas decorations.

09:23.503 --> 09:26.840
Oh, here you go...
for Quinn's monthly care.

09:30.969 --> 09:34.253
Shall we introduce Quinn
to the other girls?

09:35.849 --> 09:40.239
They're studying. l take their
home schooling vey seriously.

09:42.272 --> 09:45.045
Quinn, l'll be back in a little bit.

09:46.651 --> 09:49.685
To make sure you've settled in.
Goodbye.

09:53.032 --> 09:53.751
Ms Stout.

10:10.216 --> 10:10.997
Sit there.

10:19.475 --> 10:22.644
l'll have someone show you around,
and more importantly,

10:22.645 --> 10:24.815
fill you in on all my rules.

10:27.148 --> 10:27.879
Willamina!

10:57.930 --> 10:58.660
Willamina!

11:05.188 --> 11:07.565
- Have you seen Willamina?
- No.

11:27.376 --> 11:29.190
Janie, where's Ms Stout?

11:31.964 --> 11:33.966
Where have you been, missy?

11:34.591 --> 11:37.010
l was just playing in the alley.

11:42.850 --> 11:47.229
New kid, much cuter than you,
and younger, l'm sure she'll go fast.

11:47.230 --> 11:49.562
l want you to show her around,
introduce her to the girls,

11:49.563 --> 11:51.899
and make sure she
understands my rules.

11:51.900 --> 11:55.237
Why do l always have
to show the new kids around?

11:55.238 --> 12:00.471
Because you're the oldest and l
hold you accountable for her behaviour.

12:02.244 --> 12:04.068
Willamina, this is Quinn.

12:17.675 --> 12:18.217
Scared?

12:21.013 --> 12:22.754
You'll get used to it.

12:23.014 --> 12:25.192
And it's Will, not Willamina.

12:26.518 --> 12:28.874
Come on,
l'll show you around.

12:33.441 --> 12:36.944
- This is the living room.
- But where's the Christmas tree?

12:36.945 --> 12:40.823
Ms Stout can't stand Christmas,
so none of us are allowed to have it.

12:40.824 --> 12:44.672
No merriness, no festivity.
She confiscates any toys.

12:46.078 --> 12:49.654
And most of all, she hates
any kind of singing.

12:51.001 --> 12:52.700
Eveyone, this is Quinn.

12:53.253 --> 12:56.129
Quinn, that's Janie,
Meg, Taylor, and May.

12:56.130 --> 12:57.547
What happened to your parents?

12:57.548 --> 13:01.092
They didn't make it.
They had to go to heaven.

13:01.093 --> 13:04.679
Mine neither. Janie's too, but she still
thinks they're gonna come for her.

13:04.680 --> 13:07.348
They are gonna come for me.
You'll see.

13:07.349 --> 13:09.267
And maybe even before Christmas.

13:09.268 --> 13:13.354
Nobody's parents are coming for them.
That's why we're here, silly.

13:13.355 --> 13:15.649
Your only chance is to get adopted.

13:15.650 --> 13:17.913
- What's ''dopted?''
- Adopted.

13:19.821 --> 13:23.197
That's when a new mom and dad
think you're cute and take you home.

13:23.198 --> 13:26.661
They like little kids.
Not older ones like me.

13:28.452 --> 13:31.352
Come on, l'll show you where we sleep.

13:44.260 --> 13:48.013
Jenny just left, so l guess
this is your bed now.

13:52.353 --> 13:56.816
l'll let you settle in,
and l'll be back in a little bit.

14:34.895 --> 14:37.752
All right, Eli.
What was so important?

14:38.648 --> 14:41.651
Well, we all know you've been
feeling a little blue, sir,

14:41.652 --> 14:45.446
and l think with the help
of a little Christmas magic,

14:45.447 --> 14:47.136
we could cheer you up.

15:09.805 --> 15:10.711
My goodness!

15:13.058 --> 15:15.707
l guess he's going to need a name!

15:15.768 --> 15:17.602
He is yours to name, dear.

15:17.603 --> 15:20.315
l think l'm going to name you Paws.

15:21.649 --> 15:25.893
You and l are going to be
best friends for all eternity.

15:26.238 --> 15:30.325
- Eternity? How long is that?
- Why, forever, young pup!

15:46.925 --> 15:48.019
Yes, wonderful.

15:53.307 --> 15:54.391
Yes, vey nice.

16:08.904 --> 16:10.479
Take the reins, Paws!

16:15.619 --> 16:18.592
Easy! Here, let me help you there, Paws!

16:27.422 --> 16:31.801
Honey, this store has barely
broken even for the past 30 years.

16:31.802 --> 16:37.694
And what's curious is that Grandpa made
a profit of exactly one cent evey year.

16:39.434 --> 16:42.770
Well, l have a feeling your grandfather
was not in this for the money.

16:42.771 --> 16:44.940
Then why did he put
that stipulation in the will

16:44.941 --> 16:46.565
that we have to make
a profit over Christmas?

16:46.566 --> 16:47.640
l don't know.

16:47.694 --> 16:50.654
Maybe Grandpa Hucklebuckle wanted
to make sure the store was run properly.

16:50.655 --> 16:53.574
We need something to bring in customers.

16:55.534 --> 16:58.702
What about a store Santa?
Kids love to go see Santa.

16:58.703 --> 17:00.787
- Yes, a store Santa, of course.
- Yeah.

17:00.788 --> 17:04.040
That's a great idea!
Where do you get a store Santa?

17:04.041 --> 17:06.221
l don't know... the Internet?

17:20.810 --> 17:22.435
Who will kiss my head

17:27.857 --> 17:29.235
When l lie in bed

17:33.322 --> 17:35.251
And who will hold my hand

17:37.492 --> 17:38.889
Who will understand

17:40.996 --> 17:43.102
Who will sing my song to me

17:52.925 --> 17:54.614
Who will hold me tight

18:00.431 --> 18:01.995
ln the dark of night

18:06.230 --> 18:08.222
And who will brush my hair

18:10.315 --> 18:11.817
Rock me in my chair

18:14.363 --> 18:16.469
Who will sing my song to me

18:21.328 --> 18:23.434
Who will sing my song to me

18:27.918 --> 18:29.544
Now that you are gone

18:43.308 --> 18:45.424
What are you doing out here?

18:45.435 --> 18:49.010
You better get in here.
It's almost lights out!

18:57.946 --> 18:58.906
What's that?

18:59.071 --> 19:03.618
My mom's favourite Christmas decoration
from when she was a little girl.

19:03.619 --> 19:05.912
We used to hang it on the tree together.

19:05.913 --> 19:09.167
lt's nice. Don't let
Ms Stout see it, OK?

19:18.300 --> 19:21.396
- Don't let Ms Stout see what?
- Nothing.

19:28.143 --> 19:29.811
What are my rules about toys?

19:29.812 --> 19:32.021
- Hey, that's mine!
- Not anymore!

19:32.022 --> 19:34.942
- Please! You can't just...
- Watch me!

19:37.152 --> 19:39.779
l've got some errands to run.
Will, you're in charge.

19:39.780 --> 19:45.046
And the rest of you had better
be fast asleep by the time l get back.

19:52.208 --> 19:54.919
lt's OK, Janie.
We'll get it back.

19:56.839 --> 19:57.912
No, we won't.

19:58.090 --> 20:01.259
We both know where it's going.
It's never coming back.

20:01.260 --> 20:02.647
Where is it going?

20:23.781 --> 20:27.867
OK, sir, l've prepped the reindeer
for landing in Central Park.

20:27.868 --> 20:30.079
Ever since Mr Hucklebuckle's passing,

20:30.080 --> 20:33.081
Christmas spirit has been
out of whack in New York.

20:33.082 --> 20:35.959
You mo be careful down there
and stick together.

20:35.960 --> 20:39.087
l'll watch out for Santa.
That's what best friends are for!

20:39.088 --> 20:42.352
Don't you wory, my darling,
we'll be fine.

20:43.300 --> 20:46.177
We'll visit some ambassadors
for the Santa Cause,

20:46.178 --> 20:50.307
talk to the children and
be back in a Christmas minute.

20:52.392 --> 20:54.999
- l packed you a bag.
- Thank you.

20:55.188 --> 20:59.066
Your suit, hat, gloves,
and some of my sugarplum pie.

20:59.067 --> 21:02.893
And you seem to have forgotten
your North Pole pin.

21:04.905 --> 21:05.802
l love you.

21:06.908 --> 21:09.171
- Goodbye, Santa!
- Bye, Santa!

21:15.751 --> 21:19.160
Now Dasher, now Dancer,
now Prancer and Vixen,

21:19.586 --> 21:22.746
on Comet, on Cupid,
on Donner and Blitzen!

22:08.886 --> 22:10.095
Will? You awake?

22:14.765 --> 22:17.196
lt's just the incinerator, Quinn.

22:17.853 --> 22:21.064
Janie said Ms Stout
put her doll in there,

22:21.565 --> 22:26.163
and if we didn't behave
Ms Stout would put us in there, too.

22:29.405 --> 22:31.948
She's just saying that to scare us.

22:31.949 --> 22:36.194
Ms Stout is not gonna put
Janie or anyone else in there.

22:36.495 --> 22:37.998
Go back to bed, OK?

23:07.693 --> 23:10.665
Oh, there she is, Paws,
the grand lady.

23:11.240 --> 23:14.524
- The Statue of Libem.
- Wow! She's amazing.

23:19.913 --> 23:23.324
Whoa! Comet, our landing spot
is Central Park.

23:24.126 --> 23:27.234
- Put her down gently.
- All right, Santa.

23:37.932 --> 23:38.652
Wow! UFO.

23:45.398 --> 23:46.357
That's good.

23:49.401 --> 23:49.944
Well...

23:52.071 --> 23:54.313
OK, fellas, you get some rest.

23:55.075 --> 23:56.616
We'll be here
waiting for you, Santa.

23:56.618 --> 23:58.067
Yes, come on, Paws.

24:20.390 --> 24:21.111
Nice bag.

24:42.497 --> 24:45.218
l love the energy
of New York City.

24:45.749 --> 24:46.876
There's nothing like it.

24:46.877 --> 24:49.837
Wow, this is way huger
than the workshop.

24:49.838 --> 24:53.288
Now, Paws, New York City
is a great big place

24:53.466 --> 24:55.093
with a lot of people,

24:55.550 --> 24:59.440
and only those who believe
in the magic of Christmas

24:59.512 --> 25:02.682
can understand North Pole
animals like you.

25:04.436 --> 25:06.729
So you need to be vey careful.

25:10.358 --> 25:14.550
What the heck? Watch where
you're going, you old geezer!

25:16.987 --> 25:18.541
l'm so sory, ma'am.

25:19.783 --> 25:22.075
Here, let me help you with these.

25:22.076 --> 25:24.256
Just arrived in the big city.

25:25.789 --> 25:29.959
Stop your dog from yapping.
Shouldn't he be on a leash?

25:29.960 --> 25:32.753
Not eveyone
has the Christmas spirit, Paws.

25:32.754 --> 25:34.319
She's not vey jolly.

25:34.422 --> 25:37.758
Why don't you mind
your own beeswax, buster.

25:38.384 --> 25:39.480
Mery Christmas.

25:43.182 --> 25:46.634
- Madam, your hat!
- Don't wory. l'll get it.

25:47.644 --> 25:48.364
Paws! No!

25:49.604 --> 25:50.020
Stop!

25:53.524 --> 25:54.849
Did you see that?

25:57.278 --> 25:58.666
Santa! Are you OK?

26:00.615 --> 26:03.867
- Oh, no! Santa's hurt!
- That guy just got hit.

26:03.868 --> 26:05.328
Help, somebody help!

26:07.330 --> 26:10.040
Oh, Mr Elf, Mr Elf!
l need your assistance.

26:10.041 --> 26:11.553
Santa's really hurt!

26:12.669 --> 26:14.786
Oh, no!
He just walked out.

26:16.090 --> 26:18.882
- Anyone know first aid?
- l got this under control, sir.

26:18.883 --> 26:20.761
l'm a... paramedical guy.

26:28.852 --> 26:30.114
Mr Elf, wait up!

26:33.314 --> 26:35.650
Look, there's no need for you to
stick around. You can get outta here.

26:35.651 --> 26:41.010
All right, move along, eveybody!
Move along! There's nothing to see here!

26:42.115 --> 26:44.169
Get away from me, you mutt!

26:44.450 --> 26:48.620
l'm gonna have to report you to Eli,
Santa's head elf.

26:51.500 --> 26:52.886
What have we here?

26:53.918 --> 26:55.065
Nice, vey nice.

27:00.966 --> 27:01.383
Help!

27:04.928 --> 27:06.805
You all right there, bud?

27:07.432 --> 27:11.561
Gus saw your whole mishap.
Could say l saved your life.

27:11.894 --> 27:12.791
Where am l?

27:13.438 --> 27:16.296
New York City.
Manhattan. Ring a bell?

27:16.816 --> 27:20.028
All l hear is bells.
Jingle bells in fact.

27:20.945 --> 27:22.687
Come on, let's get up.

27:22.989 --> 27:25.169
Oh, no!
Which way was Santa?

27:26.283 --> 27:29.035
- Thank you for your assistance.
- Yeah.

27:29.036 --> 27:31.537
- Anyway you could direct me to...
- Yeah. No, no, l'm in...

27:31.538 --> 27:35.031
l'm in a bit of a hury, bud.
See you around.

27:35.042 --> 27:35.397
Bud?

27:39.755 --> 27:40.538
Excuse me?

27:42.423 --> 27:43.999
Pardon me? Pardon me?

27:44.050 --> 27:46.469
- We're in a rush.
- Excuse me?

27:47.137 --> 27:48.283
Excuse me? l...

27:49.599 --> 27:52.810
Excuse me?
l was hoping you could help me.

27:52.935 --> 27:55.853
You see, l don't quite
remember where l live,

27:55.854 --> 27:58.285
or anything else for that matter.

27:58.356 --> 28:03.194
Though l do have a vague recollection
that l was supposed to be heading north.

28:03.195 --> 28:05.438
Then just take the north line.

28:06.989 --> 28:11.484
Why, thank you for your assistance.
You're a fine young man.

28:11.579 --> 28:15.426
- Mery Christmas!
- Yeah, Mery Christmas to you, too.

28:18.418 --> 28:22.057
Can anyone help me?
l'm looking for Santa Claus.

28:25.885 --> 28:27.448
What do we got here?

28:33.098 --> 28:36.613
This whole night has been a bust.
It's just...

28:39.105 --> 28:41.368
- What is...?
- Mery Christmas.

28:42.108 --> 28:43.202
Happy Holidays!

28:45.111 --> 28:46.572
Hey, Mery Christmas.

28:47.781 --> 28:49.989
Thank you vey much.
Thank you.

28:49.990 --> 28:50.345
Hey!

28:52.494 --> 28:52.848
Hey!

28:56.455 --> 28:58.571
This is my turf, bud! Scram!

28:59.543 --> 29:01.836
- l don't want any trouble, l just...
- Leave the bell!

29:01.837 --> 29:03.953
- OK, OK, OK!
- Ho, ho, ho!

29:06.090 --> 29:07.289
Ho. Ho, ho, ho!

29:12.597 --> 29:15.652
Happy Christmas...
Happy Christmas to you.

29:46.505 --> 29:47.787
Hucklebuckle Toys?

29:49.343 --> 29:52.428
Well, the lady at the
Santa Claus agency laughed at me

29:52.429 --> 29:56.318
when l asked if they had
any available store Santas.

29:58.727 --> 30:02.428
l had no idea how
beautiful this store was. Look.

30:02.855 --> 30:07.288
Kate, just don't get too attached
to this place, all right?

30:07.400 --> 30:09.986
lt'll be up for sale
as soon as it's ours,

30:09.987 --> 30:12.697
and then we're gonna go back to LA.

30:12.698 --> 30:17.702
lt was kind of nice to have an extra
project to take my mind off it all.

30:17.703 --> 30:21.247
l was kind of dreading the
Christmas season without a child.

30:21.248 --> 30:23.125
l know, honey, come here.

30:26.588 --> 30:29.087
Come on. Let's call it a night, OK?

30:29.088 --> 30:31.205
- We had a big day.
- Yeah.

30:40.976 --> 30:41.893
Hucklebuckle.

31:01.078 --> 31:02.047
Good morning.

31:02.997 --> 31:04.270
Thank you. Hello.

31:05.541 --> 31:07.116
How are you? Morning.

31:35.364 --> 31:38.033
Hey, the agency must have found one.

31:40.076 --> 31:41.286
He's... perfect.

31:43.120 --> 31:46.956
Look at him with his beard,
and the kind eyes, and that belly.

31:46.957 --> 31:50.649
Yes. l guess l could
stand to lose a few pounds!

31:52.380 --> 31:54.756
And the laugh is pretty good.
Vey convincing.

31:54.757 --> 31:56.894
- Great job, honey!
- Well...

31:57.176 --> 31:57.655
Wow...

32:00.555 --> 32:02.806
What a beautiful place this is.

32:02.807 --> 32:06.258
Thank you. It's been
in our family for years.

32:06.810 --> 32:09.428
- So, can you start today?
- Start?

32:11.566 --> 32:13.871
You're looking for work, right?

32:14.736 --> 32:15.278
Well...

32:17.613 --> 32:19.490
More like a home, really.

32:21.116 --> 32:25.120
You see, l'm new in town and...
a little disoriented.

32:27.582 --> 32:29.386
l didn't get your name.

32:31.961 --> 32:32.743
My name...

32:37.925 --> 32:39.615
Bud. They call me Bud.

32:39.969 --> 32:44.305
Vey pleased to meet you, Bud.
l'm Kate. This is my husband, James.

32:44.306 --> 32:44.962
Hi, Bud.

32:46.809 --> 32:49.782
Well, what kind of
work is it, exactly?

32:50.854 --> 32:52.303
Oh, in-store Santa.

32:53.649 --> 32:56.006
You know, you talk to the kids,

32:56.152 --> 32:58.779
you ask them what they want
for Christmas, you listen.

32:58.780 --> 33:01.448
Oh, that sounds
like something l could handle.

33:01.449 --> 33:03.753
- Great!
- So, we have a deal.

33:03.994 --> 33:07.870
Bud, if you'd like the job,
and you need a place to stay,

33:07.872 --> 33:11.125
we do have a spare room
with a bed in it.

33:14.293 --> 33:16.411
Yeah, here, let me show you.

33:16.838 --> 33:21.258
l don't know if you have your own
or whatever, but if you don't mind,

33:21.259 --> 33:24.011
we would love for you to wear
my grandfather's old Santa suit.

33:24.012 --> 33:27.662
- Yeah, for good luck.
- Certainly, l don't mind!

33:28.850 --> 33:30.122
Great. All right.

33:31.227 --> 33:34.564
All right, the Santa suit
is in this closet.

33:35.148 --> 33:36.348
l hope it fits.

33:42.197 --> 33:44.084
Why, hello, Cindy Cramord!

33:46.494 --> 33:50.799
Oh, l'm sory. Must have been
a case of mistaken identity.

33:51.665 --> 33:53.187
Franklin, you animal!

33:53.709 --> 33:56.001
- Are we still on for Friday night?
- l'll call you.

33:56.002 --> 33:58.411
l've gotta go get my hair done.

34:07.805 --> 34:09.317
Where are you going?

34:11.810 --> 34:15.147
- Who says l'm going anywhere?
- Can l come?

34:16.188 --> 34:18.056
OK, but we have to hury.

34:19.692 --> 34:20.349
Come on.

34:26.866 --> 34:30.117
All right, Ms Stout takes
mo hours to get her hair done.

34:30.118 --> 34:32.663
l don't know why she bothers.
She looks like a hedgehog.

34:32.664 --> 34:34.050
What's a hedgehog?

35:12.410 --> 35:13.745
lt fits perfectly.

35:23.088 --> 35:25.809
l hope your grandpa's suit fits Bud.

35:27.468 --> 35:33.067
You know Grandpa Hucklebuckle used to
say that Santa himself gave it to him.

35:42.525 --> 35:43.787
Do l look funny?

35:45.861 --> 35:47.977
No. No. Bud, you look great.

35:49.699 --> 35:52.616
lf l wasn't an adult, l'd believe
you were Santa himself.

35:52.617 --> 35:55.619
l don't think you're
ever too old to believe.

35:55.620 --> 35:58.394
Why don't you ty the chair out, Bud?

36:04.296 --> 36:08.237
lsn't that the most beautiful bike
you've ever seen?

36:08.593 --> 36:13.326
- Is this Santa's workshop?
- No, silly, it's just a toy store.

36:14.597 --> 36:16.682
You have to have money to buy stuff.

36:16.683 --> 36:18.924
Will, look!
It's Santa Claus!

36:19.520 --> 36:23.263
He's not real. He's just here
to help sell toys.

36:29.070 --> 36:30.832
lt's rather comfortable.

36:33.866 --> 36:35.868
Ho, ho, ho, Mery Christmas!

36:46.631 --> 36:47.892
You can come in.

36:48.423 --> 36:51.133
l don't got any money
to buy toys.

36:53.594 --> 36:56.179
That's OK, sweetie.
What's your name?

36:56.180 --> 36:57.462
- Quinn.
- Quinn?

36:58.766 --> 37:01.425
Are you here with your mom and dad?

37:02.519 --> 37:04.084
They didn't make it.

37:05.523 --> 37:07.576
Then who are you here with?

37:10.069 --> 37:11.885
ls that your big sister?

37:13.364 --> 37:15.721
Do you wanna talk to Santa? OK.

37:16.201 --> 37:16.858
Come on.

37:20.204 --> 37:22.070
And who do we have here?

37:22.416 --> 37:23.500
This is Quinn.

37:25.794 --> 37:26.273
Quinn.

37:28.171 --> 37:29.798
That's a pretty name.

37:31.383 --> 37:34.968
Would you like to tell Santa
what you want for Christmas?

37:34.969 --> 37:36.232
Well, hop on up.

37:40.641 --> 37:43.415
Sory. l had to see if you were real.

37:43.727 --> 37:45.480
That's quite all right.

37:47.398 --> 37:50.818
So what would you like Santa
to get you for Christmas, little one?

37:50.819 --> 37:55.291
l'd like it if you could
give Will the bike in the window.

37:55.783 --> 37:59.785
She's really nice, even if
she doesn't believe in Santa.

37:59.786 --> 38:03.871
And the girls at the foster home
need something to cheer them up.

38:03.872 --> 38:05.812
Like a puppy or something.

38:06.084 --> 38:07.532
lsn't she adorable?

38:10.546 --> 38:12.840
Come on, Quinn, we have to go!

38:13.549 --> 38:18.461
We'll see what Santa can do
for your friend, Will, and the girls.

38:19.264 --> 38:21.150
Thank you. Mery Christmas!

38:21.722 --> 38:23.308
Mery Christmas, Quinn.

38:27.979 --> 38:30.273
l told you. Santa is not real.

38:30.608 --> 38:32.839
No, l pinched him. He's real.

38:34.152 --> 38:37.155
You'll see.
Whatever you asked for won't happen.

38:37.156 --> 38:40.826
My mom says Christmas wishes
come true if you believe.

38:40.827 --> 38:43.953
- Well, your mom was fibbing.
- Take it back!

38:43.954 --> 38:47.456
- What?
- Take back what you said about my mom.

38:47.457 --> 38:49.804
No, l won't! Santa is made-up.

38:52.172 --> 38:54.466
Bud? What did she ask you for?

38:54.672 --> 38:55.214
Well...

38:56.843 --> 39:01.303
She wanted me to get her friend, Will,
that red bike in the window.

39:01.304 --> 39:05.266
And a puppy to cheer up
the girls in the foster home.

39:05.267 --> 39:07.269
- She's an orphan?
- Yeah.

39:08.980 --> 39:11.355
Aren't you a little fluffy poodle?

39:11.356 --> 39:14.869
Hury up, laddies!
l'll take care of this lass.

39:18.571 --> 39:19.364
Disgusting!

39:20.490 --> 39:22.378
You filthy little poochie.

39:22.994 --> 39:23.765
Let's go.

39:29.333 --> 39:31.576
Get out of here, you mongrels!

39:33.337 --> 39:38.091
- Hey, those are my sausages!
- Maybe those dogs have seen Santa.

39:40.218 --> 39:41.302
Get back here!

39:55.192 --> 39:57.484
Hey, that wasn't vey nice of you guys.

39:57.485 --> 39:59.278
Go sniff a hydrant, meddler!

39:59.279 --> 40:02.375
Yeah, laddie, who
invited you to the pam?

40:02.448 --> 40:05.950
Allow me to introduce myself.
l'm Paws, from the North Pole.

40:05.951 --> 40:08.611
Yeah, mon,
and l be da tooth faiy.

40:10.247 --> 40:14.835
Listen, laddie, just because we're
street dogs doesn't mean we're daft.

40:14.836 --> 40:20.070
You're clearly another one of those
uptown dogs with that bonny collar.

40:21.216 --> 40:24.677
State your business, buster,
before l bite ya like a chew toy.

40:24.678 --> 40:26.720
l need help finding Santa Claus.

40:26.721 --> 40:29.557
You expect us to believe
you know the man himself?

40:29.558 --> 40:31.311
What's in it for us, pal?

40:31.312 --> 40:34.397
Well, l'm sure Santa Claus
will appreciate your help

40:34.398 --> 40:37.671
and may even take
you off the naughty list.

40:37.733 --> 40:38.702
Naughty list.

40:44.656 --> 40:45.198
Gotcha!

41:06.762 --> 41:08.525
- Help us, mon!
- Help!

41:17.649 --> 41:19.703
And where have you mo been?

41:21.026 --> 41:24.863
l was just showing Quinn
where to take out the garbage.

41:24.864 --> 41:29.076
Well, l find that vey interesting
seeing as how we burn all the trash...

41:29.077 --> 41:30.662
...in the incinerator.

41:31.536 --> 41:34.455
Your hair looks
really pretty, Ms Stout.

41:34.456 --> 41:36.333
- You don't say?
- Yeah.

41:36.960 --> 41:38.596
Yeah, like a hedgehog!

41:40.963 --> 41:42.891
But that's what you said.

41:46.008 --> 41:49.930
l think it's time we show Quinn
the consequences of breaking the rules.

41:49.931 --> 41:50.473
lnside!

41:51.930 --> 41:54.142
Willamina knows that
when you break the rules,

41:54.143 --> 41:58.147
you get to spend all night
down here in the basement.

42:03.818 --> 42:07.362
You don't wanna be locked
down here all night, do you?

42:07.363 --> 42:10.826
Well, good. l'm glad
we understand each other.

42:12.159 --> 42:15.987
You're staying here,
and no dinner for you, either.

42:33.514 --> 42:36.058
New kids always get me in trouble.

42:48.404 --> 42:51.741
All right, doggies.
Let's get you in lockup.

42:55.827 --> 42:57.111
Bursting bagpipes!

42:57.288 --> 43:00.031
- Help!
- The situation is dire, mon!

43:00.292 --> 43:02.887
Hang on, guys. l'll be right back.

43:08.924 --> 43:09.644
You mutt!

43:15.807 --> 43:17.433
Where did he go, mon?

43:20.435 --> 43:23.042
Paws, you gotta bust us outta here!

43:23.981 --> 43:25.254
Stand back, guys.

43:29.236 --> 43:30.737
Come on, guys! Quick!

43:30.738 --> 43:32.573
Let's run like da wind, mon!

43:32.574 --> 43:34.263
Let's bust this joint!

43:36.410 --> 43:39.257
- Get out of my way!
- Hey, watch it!

43:40.748 --> 43:45.053
- What's a matter with you people?
- Get out of the road!

43:49.424 --> 43:53.438
Dat was amazing! You really
are Santa Claus' dog, mon.

43:53.760 --> 43:56.304
And that means we
really are on the naughty list!

43:56.305 --> 43:59.172
Oh, yes, T-Money.
Multiple infractions.

43:59.474 --> 44:02.478
You did us a solid, mon.
You be cool with us.

44:02.479 --> 44:03.685
Now we're your peeps.

44:03.686 --> 44:06.271
We'll keep an eye
out for Santa. Fo' real.

44:06.272 --> 44:07.243
Thanks, guys.

44:07.441 --> 44:10.942
l hate to interrupt, but we've got
to get away from the dogcatcher.

44:10.943 --> 44:13.854
You go hide, Paws.
We got him covered.

44:21.038 --> 44:22.122
There you are!

44:30.796 --> 44:33.216
How am l ever
gonna find Santa?

44:37.513 --> 44:42.371
One leaf from the Silver Linden
and the nature badge is all mine!

44:50.232 --> 44:50.651
Whoa!

44:53.361 --> 44:55.862
Hey, kid, do you believe
in Santa Claus?

44:55.864 --> 44:58.741
- You can talk?
- We're from the North Pole.

44:58.742 --> 45:02.203
We can communicate with all creatures,
as long as you believe in Santa Claus.

45:02.204 --> 45:05.424
- l believe in Santa Claus.
- That's great!

45:05.541 --> 45:09.001
Look, we need a big favour. Santa's been
gone longer than we expected.

45:09.002 --> 45:11.879
We're worried about him.
Christmas is right around the corner.

45:11.880 --> 45:13.797
But if you're Santa's reindeer,

45:13.798 --> 45:16.926
why can't you just fly back
to the North Pole for help?

45:16.927 --> 45:20.054
We can't fly without the
Christmas magic in Santa's cystal,

45:20.055 --> 45:21.971
and we have no idea where he is.

45:21.972 --> 45:24.267
We need you to find Santa Claus for us.

45:24.268 --> 45:27.227
But there must be
a thousand Santas in New York!

45:27.228 --> 45:31.565
But there's only one real Santa Claus.
You'll know him when you find him.

45:31.566 --> 45:35.861
As a member of the 23rd Street
Junior Wilderness Adventurers,

45:35.862 --> 45:39.315
- l will do my level best, Mr...
- l'm Comet.

45:41.492 --> 45:44.466
- That's Dancer.
- Mr Comet, l'm Jimmy.

45:46.747 --> 45:49.219
That's my leader.
l have to go!

45:53.505 --> 45:54.705
l'm here! Here!

45:55.256 --> 45:58.382
Jimmy, Jimmy, Jimmy,
you gotta stay with the group.

45:58.383 --> 46:01.720
Now, come on. Let's go to the
Junior Wilderness Adventurer cave!

46:01.721 --> 46:05.569
Marching. Marching. One, mo, three,
one, mo, three...

46:11.647 --> 46:12.065
Help!

46:13.023 --> 46:13.440
Help!

46:14.317 --> 46:16.017
Has anybody seen Santa?

46:16.152 --> 46:18.154
Help! Santa? Where are you?

46:22.783 --> 46:24.296
Can anybody hear me?

46:32.709 --> 46:36.411
- Hey, have you seen Santa Claus?
- You're a dog!

46:50.728 --> 46:53.646
l've never met
a dog that talks before.

46:53.647 --> 46:56.773
- Where did you come from?
- l came from the North Pole.

46:56.774 --> 46:59.131
- My name's Paws.
- l'm Quinn.

46:59.444 --> 47:01.903
Does that mean
you know Santa Claus?

47:01.904 --> 47:03.865
Yeah! He's my best friend.

47:03.866 --> 47:06.784
But l can't find him and
l'm supposed to take care of him.

47:06.785 --> 47:09.882
Wow! He sure is quick
at granting wishes.

47:10.831 --> 47:15.000
l have to go. If l get caught out here,
l'll have to go to the basement.

47:15.001 --> 47:17.837
Can l come with you? l'm really lost.

47:18.047 --> 47:22.342
The lady here is mean, so we
have to hide you real good.

47:22.800 --> 47:24.551
Come on! Come on, Paws!

47:50.578 --> 47:55.739
We can sleep here tonight and l can
help you look for Santa tomorrow.

48:05.385 --> 48:08.315
- Good night, Paws.
- Good night, Quinn.

48:20.733 --> 48:22.318
- Thank you.
- Hello!

48:23.778 --> 48:25.655
And what's your name, young man?

48:25.656 --> 48:27.365
Braiden. Bratty Braiden.

48:28.282 --> 48:30.533
lt's what my brother
and sister call me.

48:30.534 --> 48:35.133
Well, l see a kind boy who
wants to bring joy to his family.

48:36.416 --> 48:38.188
- Really?
- Yes, really.

48:38.875 --> 48:44.048
Now what would you like to give your
brother and sister for Christmas?

48:44.715 --> 48:45.934
- Honey.
- What?

48:46.009 --> 48:49.095
Bud is so amazing. The kids
are just drawn to him.

48:49.096 --> 48:49.877
Excuse me.

48:50.805 --> 48:53.055
- Can you help me pick out a few toys?
- Sure.

48:53.056 --> 48:55.182
My friend, Alice, told me
all about your store.

48:55.183 --> 48:57.393
She was so impressed with your Santa.

48:57.396 --> 48:59.813
Said he got them all right into
the Christmas spirit.

48:59.814 --> 49:00.595
Thank you!

49:01.232 --> 49:04.401
And what would you like
for Christmas, Tatiana?

49:04.402 --> 49:06.320
- That on the left.
- Oh, yeah.

49:06.321 --> 49:09.489
- And that on the right.
- Those mo train tracks.

49:09.490 --> 49:12.241
Well, Santa will
see what he can do.

49:12.242 --> 49:13.338
Mery Christmas!

49:13.745 --> 49:15.267
- Excuse me?
- Yeah?

49:15.663 --> 49:18.582
- Hi, are you the owner?
- Yes, sir. How can l be of assistance?

49:18.583 --> 49:21.377
Just... your store Santa
was suggesting to my kid

49:21.378 --> 49:24.045
that he buy presents
for kids in need.

49:24.046 --> 49:25.880
Oh, l'm sory.
l'll have a word with him.

49:25.881 --> 49:28.258
No, that's great.
l just wanted to say

49:28.259 --> 49:31.594
that we love that your store gives
a free present to a needy child

49:31.595 --> 49:34.097
- with evey purchase.
- Excuse me.

49:34.390 --> 49:37.307
Kate, did you hear what
Bud is telling the children?

49:37.308 --> 49:39.144
Yes, and l think it
is such a good idea.

49:39.145 --> 49:42.794
- No, we can't afford that!
- Honey, look around.

49:49.279 --> 49:52.386
This place could use
some Christmas cheer.

49:55.785 --> 49:56.204
Paws!

49:59.122 --> 49:59.477
Wow!

50:01.751 --> 50:04.169
How did you get this stuff here?

50:19.559 --> 50:20.039
Quinn!

50:24.730 --> 50:26.784
What are you doing in here?

50:27.651 --> 50:31.134
Where did these Christmas
decorations come from?

50:35.075 --> 50:36.783
Where did you find this puppy?

50:36.784 --> 50:39.120
l didn't find him, he found me.

50:39.121 --> 50:42.634
He came from the North Pole
on Santa's sleigh.

50:43.959 --> 50:45.409
Paws, this is Will.

50:51.050 --> 50:52.966
Quinn, that dog can't bark in here.

50:52.967 --> 50:55.303
Do you have any idea how
much trouble we'll get in?

50:55.304 --> 50:58.014
But he's not barking,
he's talking!

50:58.015 --> 50:59.766
Quinn, dogs don't talk.

51:00.392 --> 51:05.063
She can't understand me, Quinn.
She's just not a believer yet.

51:08.399 --> 51:10.318
We need to help him, Will.

51:10.319 --> 51:13.154
We need to show him the way to Santa.

51:13.237 --> 51:14.802
We know where he is.

51:15.699 --> 51:19.817
Quinn, l told you that
Santa in the store is not real.

51:21.413 --> 51:25.166
Thank you, sir. It's going to a vey
needy cause. Thank you vey much!

51:25.167 --> 51:27.169
Ho, ho, ho! Mery Christmas!

51:29.796 --> 51:32.588
Ho, ho, ho!
Yes, sir, what can l do for you?

51:32.589 --> 51:35.384
Santa, sir,
are you the one and only?

51:35.385 --> 51:37.678
Sure, kid. You put money in that bag

51:37.679 --> 51:41.055
and l'll pretend to be
anyone you want me to be.

51:41.056 --> 51:43.058
Ho, ho, ho! Mery Christmas.

51:44.559 --> 51:46.603
Hey, you're still
on my nice list!

51:46.604 --> 51:49.481
And it's the little engine
that could here in New York City.

51:49.482 --> 51:52.858
This small toy store has gathered
quite the crowd of people.

51:52.859 --> 51:55.611
They've come here to experience
a little of what they're calling

51:55.612 --> 51:59.615
the true spirit of Christmas.
l'm here with Mr and Mrs Hucklebuckle.

51:59.616 --> 52:01.660
Actually, it's, uh, Huckle.
We shortened the name.

52:01.661 --> 52:05.996
So, why is eveyone coming to
Hucklebuckle Toys to meet your Santa?

52:05.997 --> 52:09.082
Well, of course, the real
Santa is busy in the North Pole,

52:09.083 --> 52:14.015
but our Santa, Bud, he... he inspires
the true spirit of Christmas.

52:15.008 --> 52:17.759
They also like our
Christmas Spirit Programme.

52:17.760 --> 52:21.512
Purchase a hundred dollars in toys,
and we gift a toy to a child in need.

52:21.513 --> 52:23.598
- Well, that's wonderful.
- Mery Christmas to you, too!

52:23.599 --> 52:26.308
- Bud! Bud, come here!
- Let's talk to Santa himself.

52:26.309 --> 52:27.768
- Yeah. Come here, Bud.
- Mery Christmas.

52:27.769 --> 52:30.458
- Santa!
- Hello, and Mery Christmas!

52:32.192 --> 52:34.985
Santa, the kids really seem to love you.

52:34.986 --> 52:38.904
With hundreds of toy store Santas
all across New York City,

52:38.905 --> 52:40.844
what makes you so special?

52:41.324 --> 52:45.703
Nothing really, l'm just an
ambassador for the Santa Cause.

52:46.622 --> 52:51.168
One of many spreading the Christmas
spirit to children around the world,

52:51.169 --> 52:53.418
reminding them of what's important.

52:53.419 --> 52:56.004
A little humble pie. How refreshing.

52:56.005 --> 52:59.300
Well, actually my favourite
is sugarplum pie.

53:02.055 --> 53:03.638
There you have it: sugarplum.

53:03.639 --> 53:05.099
Here in New York City.

53:05.100 --> 53:06.360
Bud, are you OK?

53:11.939 --> 53:14.649
- You sent for us, Mrs Claus?
- Yes, Eli.

53:14.650 --> 53:17.235
Santa and Paws should be home by now.

53:17.236 --> 53:19.153
We were just thinking the same thing.

53:19.155 --> 53:21.364
He did say it was
just gonna be a quick trip.

53:21.365 --> 53:25.306
Well, let's check the map.
Ellis, bring up New York.

53:35.003 --> 53:38.162
Santa Claus and Paws
aren't even together.

53:38.215 --> 53:42.885
Something is definitely amiss.
Santa would never leave Paws alone.

53:42.886 --> 53:44.199
He's just a pup.

53:45.848 --> 53:49.099
Eddy, Eli, you need
to go to New York and find them.

53:49.100 --> 53:53.468
Yes, Mrs Claus. We'll ready
the truck and head right down.

53:56.150 --> 53:58.024
lt was another big day today, Bud.

53:58.025 --> 54:00.695
Oh, you must have seen 200 children.

54:00.822 --> 54:03.906
Yeah, Bud, you really seem like
you enjoy listening to the children.

54:03.907 --> 54:04.375
l do.

54:06.492 --> 54:09.870
Someone once told me that
the spirit of Christmas

54:09.871 --> 54:12.666
is embodied in the hearts of children,

54:12.916 --> 54:18.525
untouched as yet by the fears, doubts
and disappointments of the adult world.

54:18.672 --> 54:21.705
That is so beautiful.
Who told you that?

54:24.218 --> 54:26.460
l can almost picture her face.

54:28.722 --> 54:32.840
l do know she's the most
beautiful woman in the world.

54:34.061 --> 54:37.229
Bud, you seem really tired.
Are you all right?

54:37.230 --> 54:39.900
Oh, yes, of course, quite all right.

54:40.734 --> 54:43.831
l suppose l just need
some Yuletide rest.

54:48.367 --> 54:50.807
- Well, good night.
- Good night.

54:51.703 --> 54:55.238
- Good night, Bud. All right.
- Yes, good night.

54:58.252 --> 55:01.587
Honey, l'm really worried about Bud.
He doesn't seem vey good.

55:01.588 --> 55:03.755
Do you think we're
pushing him too hard?

55:03.756 --> 55:05.924
Well, he certainly earned a raise.
We're killing it.

55:05.926 --> 55:09.179
James, l am seriously
concerned for his health.

55:09.180 --> 55:11.181
Well, it's not long until Christmas,

55:11.182 --> 55:15.225
and then he can take a nice vacation,
somewhere tropical.

55:15.226 --> 55:18.240
OK, OK. Look, l will see what l can do.

55:25.153 --> 55:28.417
Ms Stout is going out.
We've got mo hours.

55:45.717 --> 55:46.071
Wow.

55:47.007 --> 55:49.969
This is the only way Bud
would take a break.

55:49.970 --> 55:54.263
You saw the line out there.
Think of all that lost revenue.

55:54.264 --> 55:54.860
Oh, no.

55:59.437 --> 56:00.334
Ho, ho, ho!

56:02.732 --> 56:04.858
All right.
Coming over here.

56:07.236 --> 56:10.209
This is the place
Santa's selling toys.

56:10.282 --> 56:12.086
OK, l'll be right back.

56:20.499 --> 56:23.409
OK, you're done.
Thank you for coming.

56:31.137 --> 56:33.128
That's not the real Santa.

56:38.769 --> 56:39.916
Will was right?

56:42.354 --> 56:45.774
l have modified the ELF compressor
to change the truck

56:45.775 --> 56:50.864
into any type of New York City vehicle
that we would like it to be.

56:56.536 --> 56:57.798
Let's melt snow.

56:59.246 --> 57:03.679
Who knows what kind of trouble
Santa Claus and Paws are in?

57:07.880 --> 57:09.704
- Bye, Eddy!
- Bye, Eli!

57:10.465 --> 57:11.362
Here we go!

57:21.351 --> 57:22.978
Don't you wory again.

57:23.271 --> 57:26.898
l'm good to go for the rest
of the day after that generous break.

57:26.899 --> 57:29.152
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

57:31.696 --> 57:34.488
- Piece of cake?
- Those kids are scay.

57:34.490 --> 57:37.639
Hello, young man,
and how can l help you?

57:38.286 --> 57:40.453
l hope you're
the real Santa Claus,

57:40.454 --> 57:45.605
'cause you're the 63rd one l've seen,
and l'm getting really pooped.

57:46.085 --> 57:48.328
You are a dedicated young man!

57:48.796 --> 57:53.405
Comet asked me to find the real
Santa and give him a message.

57:55.218 --> 57:58.930
Your reindeer are waiting
for you in Central Park!

58:00.056 --> 58:04.602
Santa, sir, that's the message.
l hope you're the real deal.

58:05.856 --> 58:06.460
Jimmy...

58:11.442 --> 58:15.239
l don't know if
l'm the real Santa Claus or not.

58:20.494 --> 58:24.374
But here's a pin to thank you
for your persistence.

58:27.209 --> 58:30.546
l believe someone vey special
gave it to me.

58:32.381 --> 58:32.797
Whoa.

58:34.340 --> 58:37.626
Thank you, Santa, sir,
and a Mery Christmas.

58:37.845 --> 58:40.262
Mery Christmas to you, too, Jimmy.

58:40.264 --> 58:42.684
Sory that wasn't the real Santa.

58:43.100 --> 58:45.508
lt's OK, Quinn. We'll find him.

58:55.405 --> 58:57.156
Quinn, you got a puppy?

58:58.031 --> 58:58.688
Come on.

59:05.037 --> 59:05.695
Come on.

59:16.383 --> 59:19.092
- His name is Paws.
- Where'd he come from?

59:19.093 --> 59:21.595
l'm Santa Claus' best friend
from the North Pole.

59:21.596 --> 59:22.743
He just talked!

59:28.937 --> 59:31.313
Don't tell me you guys
are imagining things, too.

59:31.314 --> 59:36.183
Only kids that truly believe in
Christmas spirit can hear me talk.

59:37.695 --> 59:40.864
- How can you not hear him?
- Are your ears working properly?

59:40.865 --> 59:42.857
He's talking right to you.

59:43.158 --> 59:45.900
You gotta believe, Will.
Just listen.

59:46.953 --> 59:49.321
Whenever l hear a Christmas song

59:49.583 --> 59:51.387
l wanna get up and sing

59:51.877 --> 59:54.378
Wherever there's love l sing along

59:54.379 --> 59:56.432
And find some bells to ring

59:58.382 --> 01:00:00.749
Wherever there's angels up above

01:00:00.884 --> 01:00:03.052
Wherever there's Christmas trees

01:00:03.054 --> 01:00:05.806
There's gonna be peace
and hope and love

01:00:05.807 --> 01:00:07.392
And wonderful memories

01:00:08.435 --> 01:00:10.726
There'll be laughter
There'll be song

01:00:10.727 --> 01:00:13.209
We'll go carolling all night long

01:00:14.523 --> 01:00:17.265
Believing in Christmas
makes it magic

01:00:17.318 --> 01:00:18.455
Can't you see?

01:00:19.069 --> 01:00:22.447
Guys, if you don't quiet that puppy,
Ms Stout is going to hear him barking.

01:00:22.448 --> 01:00:24.565
You don't hear Paws talking?

01:00:25.533 --> 01:00:28.245
Don't you remember Ms Stout's
rules about singing?

01:00:28.246 --> 01:00:30.842
lt's bemer to give than to receive

01:00:30.916 --> 01:00:32.605
Lessons for you and me

01:00:33.417 --> 01:00:35.785
Staying up late on Christmas Eve

01:00:35.878 --> 01:00:38.119
Will there be presents for me?

01:00:38.339 --> 01:00:40.642
No! You're not listening, Will!

01:00:40.925 --> 01:00:43.468
There'll be laughter
There'll be song

01:00:43.469 --> 01:00:45.950
We'll go carolling all night long

01:00:47.015 --> 01:00:49.725
Believing in Christmas

01:00:49.726 --> 01:00:50.862
Can't you see?

01:00:51.560 --> 01:00:54.835

l believe in love

01:00:57.525 --> 01:01:01.654
As sure as there is Santa
ringing sleigh bells up above

01:01:01.904 --> 01:01:03.718
We do believe in harmony

01:01:04.866 --> 01:01:06.680

01:01:09.119 --> 01:01:10.516
Throughout the year

01:01:16.959 --> 01:01:19.379
Whenever there's hope in the air

01:01:19.547 --> 01:01:21.485
Whenever we light the tree

01:01:22.049 --> 01:01:24.383
Whenever there's love
in our prayers

01:01:24.384 --> 01:01:26.386
That's Christmastime for me

01:01:27.011 --> 01:01:31.255
Whenever l hear a Christmas song
l wanna get up and sing

01:01:31.768 --> 01:01:34.374
Wherever there's love
l sing along

01:01:34.603 --> 01:01:36.658
And find some bells to ring

01:01:37.188 --> 01:01:39.649

01:01:48.158 --> 01:01:49.295

01:01:56.248 --> 01:02:00.377

Throughout the year

01:02:45.088 --> 01:02:47.018
What is going on in here?

01:02:55.225 --> 01:02:57.352
Willamina, who brought a puppy in here?

01:02:57.353 --> 01:03:00.010
lt was me, Ms Stout.
l found Paws.

01:03:01.772 --> 01:03:04.858
Nice ty, Quinn,
but l don't believe you.

01:03:05.777 --> 01:03:08.403
Don't think l don't know who
the ringleader of this circus is.

01:03:08.404 --> 01:03:10.167
Willamina, come with me!

01:03:16.788 --> 01:03:18.779
Well, that's a pretty gem.

01:03:22.042 --> 01:03:23.972
No, don't! Not my cystal!

01:03:30.801 --> 01:03:33.825
And the rest of you,
clean up this mess

01:03:33.846 --> 01:03:37.016
and take off those
ridiculous dresses, now!

01:03:49.235 --> 01:03:53.741
Well, l hope you enjoy each other's
company here in the pitch-black.

01:03:53.742 --> 01:03:56.472
Tomorrow, the mutt goes to the pound.

01:04:10.714 --> 01:04:13.051
What is that, a Christmas decoration?

01:04:13.052 --> 01:04:13.344
No!

01:04:18.932 --> 01:04:20.851
What are my rules about
Christmas decorations?

01:04:20.852 --> 01:04:24.020
My mom gave that to me!
Please give it back!

01:04:24.021 --> 01:04:28.578
No! Now, get upstairs before
you end up in the basement, too!

01:04:30.986 --> 01:04:31.465
Scoot!

01:04:37.492 --> 01:04:38.994
Why don't l believe

01:04:44.581 --> 01:04:46.344
ln happiness and dreams?

01:04:50.879 --> 01:04:52.569
And where do l belong?

01:04:55.302 --> 01:04:56.990
Where did it go wrong?

01:04:58.679 --> 01:05:00.796
Who will come and rescue me?

01:05:09.233 --> 01:05:10.796
Don't give up, Will.

01:05:11.024 --> 01:05:13.320
All you have to do is believe.

01:05:14.778 --> 01:05:16.770
Evemhing's going to be OK.

01:05:17.741 --> 01:05:19.743
l can understand you, Paws.

01:05:20.243 --> 01:05:23.100
You do believe in Christmas, after all!

01:05:25.331 --> 01:05:27.208
l do believe in Christmas

01:05:29.670 --> 01:05:30.993

01:05:33.548 --> 01:05:35.476
As sure as there is Santa

01:05:36.591 --> 01:05:38.719
Ringing sleigh bells up above

01:05:39.972 --> 01:05:41.786
We do believe in harmony

01:05:44.268 --> 01:05:44.986

01:05:46.476 --> 01:05:47.560
And good cheer

01:05:50.731 --> 01:05:52.128
Throughout the year

01:06:01.283 --> 01:06:02.493
lt's just not like Bud to be so late.

01:06:02.494 --> 01:06:05.037
Well, l don't think we can
hold them back much longer.

01:06:05.038 --> 01:06:07.144
l'd better go check on him.

01:06:09.792 --> 01:06:10.146
Bud?

01:06:15.465 --> 01:06:18.176
Bud, are you OK?
It's almost 9.15.

01:06:18.257 --> 01:06:19.655
My apologies, Kate.

01:06:20.427 --> 01:06:23.012
l'm feeling a tad under
the weather this morning.

01:06:23.013 --> 01:06:23.607
Oh, no.

01:06:27.684 --> 01:06:29.102
Oh, Bud! Thank goodness.

01:06:29.103 --> 01:06:32.438
ABC wants to do a quick interview
with you on your break today.

01:06:32.439 --> 01:06:36.078
- Well, l'll do my best, Mr Huckle.
- All right.

01:06:43.534 --> 01:06:45.358
James! Call an ambulance!

01:06:50.458 --> 01:06:51.855
Good morning, Paws.

01:06:54.252 --> 01:06:55.097
Paws? Paws!

01:07:02.303 --> 01:07:02.719
Paws!

01:07:05.639 --> 01:07:07.881
What's with all the dramatics?

01:07:08.559 --> 01:07:12.917
What? You want me to take a
stuffed toy dog to the pound?

01:07:13.020 --> 01:07:14.157
Can't do that.

01:07:18.818 --> 01:07:21.987
Where did the puppy go?
Did you let him escape?

01:07:21.988 --> 01:07:23.446
- No!
- You give me that dog!

01:07:23.447 --> 01:07:27.565
- Give it! You give it!
- No! Let go of him! No, stop!

01:07:46.221 --> 01:07:48.554
We're here at New York General
with a stoy that is spreading

01:07:48.555 --> 01:07:52.977
throughout the globe. An unknown store
Santa Claus from Hucklebuckle Toys

01:07:52.978 --> 01:07:55.770
who became a beacon
of light this holiday season

01:07:55.771 --> 01:07:58.775
is now clinging to life
in a Manhattan hospital.

01:07:58.776 --> 01:08:02.652
lf you know his identity,
please call James or Kate Huckle

01:08:02.653 --> 01:08:05.093
at Hucklebuckle Toys in Manhattan.

01:08:08.783 --> 01:08:10.838
l don't know what happened.

01:08:13.831 --> 01:08:17.951
l woke up and all that
was there was that stuffed dog.

01:08:50.075 --> 01:08:52.671
The map shows Santa's in the park.

01:08:58.292 --> 01:09:02.243
He looks like Santa...
but he's definitely not Santa.

01:09:03.087 --> 01:09:03.756
Augustus.

01:09:05.383 --> 01:09:05.863
Hello.

01:09:07.716 --> 01:09:11.158
l'm Eli, Santa's head elf,
and this is Eddy.

01:09:13.849 --> 01:09:15.966
Great, now l'm seeing elves.

01:09:18.520 --> 01:09:21.492
What are you guys,
from the North Pole?

01:09:22.857 --> 01:09:23.817
Yes, we are.

01:09:27.613 --> 01:09:29.729
You just talked, didn't you?

01:09:30.156 --> 01:09:32.450
Well, sure l did. l'm an elf dog.

01:09:32.451 --> 01:09:35.183
Well, Gus.
You finally have lost it.

01:09:41.877 --> 01:09:45.046
- That's Santa's cystal!
- That explains the beard.

01:09:45.046 --> 01:09:47.921
The magic of Santa's cystal
has been changing you.

01:09:47.923 --> 01:09:52.303
- Where did you get this?
- This old guy, he got hit by a taxi.

01:09:52.304 --> 01:09:55.339
He gave me his suitcase
and this cystal.

01:09:58.935 --> 01:09:59.227
No?

01:10:01.230 --> 01:10:05.046
l took both of them,
but l feel terrible about it.

01:10:08.862 --> 01:10:09.404
Eddy...

01:10:11.447 --> 01:10:13.762
...without Santa's magic cystal,

01:10:14.033 --> 01:10:15.858
he could become mortal...

01:10:16.202 --> 01:10:17.422
and eventually...

01:10:18.914 --> 01:10:22.125
We've got to find him before it's
too late. Do you know where he is?

01:10:22.126 --> 01:10:26.494
No. But look, look! l do know
where there's some reindeer.

01:10:27.715 --> 01:10:29.518
Come on, l'll show you!

01:10:33.386 --> 01:10:36.138
Over here, over here, right here. Ta-da!

01:10:36.139 --> 01:10:37.890
Eli? Eddy, is that you?

01:10:38.850 --> 01:10:41.936
lt most certainly is.
We're here to rescue you all!

01:10:41.937 --> 01:10:44.429
Hallelujah! We've been so worried.

01:10:44.772 --> 01:10:47.272
Santa's lost his cystal
and is in grave danger.

01:10:47.273 --> 01:10:51.152
We need you all to stand by the sleigh,
ready to fly at a moment's notice.

01:10:51.153 --> 01:10:54.697
l'm afraid we're all too weak.
We need something to eat.

01:10:54.698 --> 01:10:58.618
We need to find eggnog, gingerbread
cookies, fruitcake, things like that.

01:10:58.619 --> 01:11:01.663
l know a place! l'll take care of them!
Where are you going?

01:11:01.664 --> 01:11:05.001
3045 West 64th Street.
That's where Paws is.

01:11:06.793 --> 01:11:08.003
He's our only hope now.

01:11:08.004 --> 01:11:09.672
l'll go get the food!

01:11:09.673 --> 01:11:10.757
Come on, Eddy!

01:11:12.883 --> 01:11:13.665
Thank you.

01:11:22.894 --> 01:11:24.719
Next stop: Staten Island!

01:11:37.240 --> 01:11:40.619
Mery Christmas, girls.
l'm Eli, and this is Eddy.

01:11:40.620 --> 01:11:42.622
We're Santa's elves from the North Pole.

01:11:42.623 --> 01:11:44.625
Thank goodness you're here.

01:11:46.752 --> 01:11:50.461
Paws was here, but l woke up and
all that was there was a stuffed toy.

01:11:50.462 --> 01:11:53.987
- A stuffed toy? His cystal!
- Did it come off?

01:11:54.008 --> 01:11:58.134
Yes! Ms Stout took it off him and
we don't know where either of them are.

01:11:58.135 --> 01:12:00.929
We have to find both fast
and put his cystal back on

01:12:00.930 --> 01:12:03.223
- before his life force runs out.
- Hury! Go!

01:12:03.224 --> 01:12:04.862
- OK, OK.
- Go! Hury!

01:12:07.437 --> 01:12:09.229
Comet, l'm here
to report back to you.

01:12:09.230 --> 01:12:14.465
l met 122 possible Santa Clauses
and all of them are clearly impostors.

01:12:14.819 --> 01:12:16.529
- But l did find one who...
- Hey!

01:12:16.530 --> 01:12:19.438
You guys!
l got evemhing l could find.

01:12:19.574 --> 01:12:22.577
Hello, sir. l'm here on official
North Pole business.

01:12:22.578 --> 01:12:25.748
Hey, me too! l'm Gus,
l'm a North Pole helper.

01:12:25.749 --> 01:12:28.834
- Mr Gus. l'm Jimmy.
- How ya doin', Jimmy?

01:12:28.835 --> 01:12:31.711
Hey, Jimmy, where did you
get that pin? That's Santa's!

01:12:31.712 --> 01:12:34.839
That's what l was about to tell you!
He gave me this!

01:12:34.840 --> 01:12:39.634
Wait a second, if you've seen Santa
Claus, we'd better get you to the elves.

01:12:39.635 --> 01:12:44.056
Hey, you guys eat up!
Come on, Jimmy! We'll be right back.

01:13:03.785 --> 01:13:04.995
Oh, my goodness!

01:13:14.797 --> 01:13:16.787
Hang on, Paws! l'm coming!

01:13:19.968 --> 01:13:23.179
l found the cystal,
but Paws wasn't there!

01:13:26.765 --> 01:13:27.423
Come on!

01:13:37.652 --> 01:13:40.020
- Quinn!
- l have to save Paws!

01:13:41.907 --> 01:13:43.356
Turn the power off!

01:13:58.004 --> 01:13:59.881
Come on, Quinn.
Get out.

01:14:00.716 --> 01:14:01.310
OK, OK.

01:14:04.220 --> 01:14:06.639
There's still life force in him.

01:14:31.163 --> 01:14:33.247
lt's really good to see you, Paws.

01:14:33.248 --> 01:14:36.105
Eli! Eddy!
Thank goodness you're here!

01:14:37.377 --> 01:14:41.798
We have to find Santa.
We have to get him his cystal back.

01:14:41.840 --> 01:14:43.279
Come on, let's go!

01:14:47.052 --> 01:14:49.597
- l'll knock.
- Come on, open up!

01:14:50.891 --> 01:14:52.767
Eli, Eddy. This is Jimmy.

01:14:54.061 --> 01:14:56.730
He thinks he's seen...
Santa Claus.

01:14:56.856 --> 01:14:59.400
- He gave me this!
- Santa's pin!

01:14:59.775 --> 01:15:03.727
- He's at Hucklebuckle Toys!
- We know where that is!

01:15:04.280 --> 01:15:07.689
- Girls, get your coats!
- OK, come on, Quinn.

01:15:11.204 --> 01:15:14.414
Check it out, guys.
That's Paws. We found him!

01:15:14.415 --> 01:15:16.584
Get in the car.
In the car!

01:15:17.376 --> 01:15:17.668
OK.

01:15:19.586 --> 01:15:22.212
- l better get home.
- Mission accomplished, Jimmy.

01:15:22.213 --> 01:15:24.966
- We'll take it from here.
- l better give you this pin back.

01:15:24.967 --> 01:15:29.138
No, no, no. You keep it, Jimmy.
You're an official Santa's helper now.

01:15:29.139 --> 01:15:32.955
Wow! l will wear it with pride.
Thank you, Mr Elf.

01:15:35.436 --> 01:15:37.395
Well, we can't just
stand here lollygagging.

01:15:37.396 --> 01:15:39.398
Let's follow them, laddies!

01:15:47.446 --> 01:15:51.033
Not a single call from anyone
that knows of Bud's family or identity.

01:15:51.034 --> 01:15:51.755
Poor Bud.

01:15:54.955 --> 01:15:56.747
Should we go visit him
in the hospital again?

01:15:56.748 --> 01:15:57.164
Yeah.

01:16:02.795 --> 01:16:06.924
lt's those girls from the foster home,
and some interesting-looking friends.

01:16:06.925 --> 01:16:08.551
Well, go let them in!

01:16:17.768 --> 01:16:21.470
- We're here to save Santa Claus.
- You mean Bud?

01:16:21.480 --> 01:16:22.929
Bud is Santa Claus.

01:16:24.150 --> 01:16:27.497
She is correct.
Allow me to introduce myself.

01:16:28.905 --> 01:16:30.948
l'm Eli, Santa's head elf.

01:16:31.323 --> 01:16:35.077
This is Eddy the Elf Dog, and Paws,
Santa's best friend.

01:16:35.078 --> 01:16:37.371
We're all from the North Pole.

01:16:37.537 --> 01:16:39.539
Santa lost his magic cystal

01:16:39.916 --> 01:16:42.666
and his health must have been
deteriorating ever since.

01:16:42.667 --> 01:16:44.669
Honey, that dog is talking.

01:16:45.255 --> 01:16:48.414
l see you believe
in the Christmas spirit.

01:16:49.049 --> 01:16:51.041
You know, l didn't always.

01:16:51.635 --> 01:16:54.262
You know, l hate to be the
bearer of bad news, but you're right.

01:16:54.263 --> 01:16:56.054
He's in the hospital
in critical condition.

01:16:56.055 --> 01:16:58.600
- Oh, no!
- We have to go there now.

01:16:58.601 --> 01:17:01.227
They won't release him to us.
Only next of kin.

01:17:01.228 --> 01:17:03.772
We have to find a way of
getting Santa out of the hospital

01:17:03.773 --> 01:17:07.286
- and back to the North Pole.
- l have a plan.

01:17:12.739 --> 01:17:13.469
Willamina!

01:17:14.700 --> 01:17:17.912
lt's about time
you open up, you little...

01:17:21.874 --> 01:17:24.751
To what do we owe
the honour of this visit?

01:17:24.752 --> 01:17:29.497
l received a phone call from
a neighbour. Someone named Eli Elf.

01:17:30.133 --> 01:17:33.676
He said that the children were
Ieft here all night alone,

01:17:33.677 --> 01:17:38.171
and it appears mo of the girls,
Will and Quinn, are missing!

01:17:38.765 --> 01:17:41.497
Yes. Right, we were looking for them.

01:17:43.353 --> 01:17:46.513
You are no longer
permitted in this house,

01:17:47.024 --> 01:17:49.619
by order of the State of New York.

01:17:49.735 --> 01:17:52.402
And furthermore, if anything
has happened to those children,

01:17:52.403 --> 01:17:54.530
you will be held accountable.

01:17:55.115 --> 01:17:57.358
But l love those little brats!

01:18:03.831 --> 01:18:05.751
You can't do this to me!

01:18:06.670 --> 01:18:07.930
You guys go, go!

01:18:08.713 --> 01:18:09.609
l just did.

01:18:30.150 --> 01:18:33.487
All right, we're good.
Come on, let's go. Come on, hury.

01:18:33.488 --> 01:18:34.143
Come on!

01:18:35.906 --> 01:18:37.543
- Go, go.
- OK, OK...

01:18:38.240 --> 01:18:40.252
- Honey...
- OK, all right.

01:18:47.709 --> 01:18:49.282
Over here, over here.

01:18:51.422 --> 01:18:54.622
- That's it. Get him in here.
- l got it.

01:18:54.675 --> 01:18:56.133
- Hold on. All right.
- OK, ready?

01:18:56.134 --> 01:18:57.280
One, mo, three!

01:19:00.054 --> 01:19:02.513
- That's a lot of gingerbread!
- OK, come on. Let's go.

01:19:02.514 --> 01:19:03.287
Let's go!

01:19:09.940 --> 01:19:11.201
Come on. Get in!

01:19:44.931 --> 01:19:46.370
ls he gonna be OK?

01:19:49.143 --> 01:19:50.833
ls Santa going to die?

01:19:54.232 --> 01:19:55.984
We don't know, sweetie.

01:19:57.820 --> 01:19:59.258
He has to make it.

01:20:02.741 --> 01:20:03.096
Eli?

01:20:04.784 --> 01:20:08.475
Take my cystal off
and place it next to Santa's.

01:20:08.998 --> 01:20:10.624
Paws, if you do that,

01:20:11.876 --> 01:20:14.418
we might not be able
to bring you back a second time.

01:20:14.419 --> 01:20:17.516
And you may become
a stuffed toy forever.

01:20:17.547 --> 01:20:22.167
We have no choice. All the children
around the world need him.

01:20:23.553 --> 01:20:26.839
Can you imagine a world
without Santa Claus?

01:20:47.870 --> 01:20:50.716
Can l have some time with Santa alone?

01:20:53.417 --> 01:20:53.833
Sure.

01:21:11.391 --> 01:21:16.376
Come on, Santa. We're supposed
to be best friends for all eternity.

01:22:09.659 --> 01:22:12.214
- Santa Claus!
- Look, it's Santa.

01:22:12.870 --> 01:22:14.256
Come on, stand up.

01:22:14.455 --> 01:22:15.780
Come on, come on.

01:22:18.333 --> 01:22:21.128
We have to get back
to the North Pole at once.

01:22:21.129 --> 01:22:24.841
Only the Great Christmas Icicle
can save Paws now.

01:22:33.475 --> 01:22:35.560
Eli, do we have the reindeer?

01:22:35.561 --> 01:22:37.478
They should be here any minute, sir.

01:22:37.479 --> 01:22:40.461
Whoa! Right here.
Good, guys, great job.

01:22:43.942 --> 01:22:44.360
Whoa!

01:22:47.321 --> 01:22:50.740
We got a few odd looks in traffic,
but, hey, that's New York.

01:22:50.741 --> 01:22:52.908
Thank goodness you're
all right, Santa.

01:22:52.909 --> 01:22:56.329
We have to get Paws to the
Great Christmas Icicle right away.

01:22:56.330 --> 01:22:57.871
We're ready to fly, SC!

01:22:57.872 --> 01:23:00.469
Hang on, Paws. We'll be home soon.

01:23:02.002 --> 01:23:05.880
All right, let's get back
to the North Pole and fast!

01:23:05.881 --> 01:23:07.654
- Goodbye!
- Bye, Santa!

01:23:09.259 --> 01:23:11.886
- Goodbye Santa.
- Get better, Paws!

01:24:15.784 --> 01:24:16.753
Oh, goodness.

01:24:19.120 --> 01:24:20.746
l was afraid of this.

01:24:21.247 --> 01:24:23.372
With Christmas coming so soon,

01:24:23.375 --> 01:24:27.201
the Icicle just doesn't
have enough magic to spare.

01:24:29.339 --> 01:24:32.300
l never thought l'd have such a friend.

01:24:47.314 --> 01:24:48.586
What's happening?

01:25:01.413 --> 01:25:03.227
Paws? Paws, you're back!

01:25:05.835 --> 01:25:06.490
But how?

01:25:07.084 --> 01:25:10.973
lt was your love for each other
and Christmas magic!

01:25:16.053 --> 01:25:18.055
Santa, what happened to me?

01:25:18.387 --> 01:25:23.351
You're no longer a pup. From now
on your name will be Santa Paws!

01:25:24.017 --> 01:25:28.761
Now we really can be best friends
for all eternity, Santa Claus.

01:25:35.112 --> 01:25:37.594
Please, come in!
l'm Mrs Gibson.

01:25:41.285 --> 01:25:43.653
Thank goodness you girls are OK!

01:25:43.787 --> 01:25:45.852
We're really good, actually.

01:25:48.542 --> 01:25:50.232
l'll never forget you.

01:25:51.378 --> 01:25:53.432
And we'll never forget you.

01:25:54.215 --> 01:25:56.268
You know, they need a home.

01:25:57.634 --> 01:25:59.408
- Honey? Yeah.
- Really?

01:26:00.012 --> 01:26:04.473
l think that is the greatest Christmas
present l could ever imagine.

01:26:04.474 --> 01:26:07.143
- You wanna go home with us?
- Yes!

01:26:09.397 --> 01:26:11.606
Do you want a Christmas tree?
And lots of presents?

01:26:11.607 --> 01:26:12.732
And you want lots of presents?

01:26:12.733 --> 01:26:14.775
lt's that wonderful time of year

01:26:14.776 --> 01:26:18.905
Hury! Christmas is just around
the corner, people! Come on!

01:26:18.906 --> 01:26:21.209
Eveyone's working
Busy as bees

01:26:21.617 --> 01:26:23.973
Eveyone's happy
As you can see

01:26:24.243 --> 01:26:26.996
Christmas is coming
Children are laughing

01:26:26.997 --> 01:26:29.415
lt's that wonderful time of year

01:26:34.505 --> 01:26:39.416
We picked up all the mail that
was sent to Santa at the hospital.

01:26:40.636 --> 01:26:43.804
Boughs of holly!
What are you guys doing here?

01:26:43.805 --> 01:26:47.432
We thought you laddies might need a wee
bit of help getting ready for Christmas.

01:26:47.433 --> 01:26:49.769
We want to get off Santa's
naughty list, mister.

01:26:49.770 --> 01:26:54.014
We would be proud to have you
join us as official elves.

01:26:54.606 --> 01:26:57.213
lt's that wonderful time of year...

01:26:57.651 --> 01:26:59.652
Oh, this is a bonny outfit!

01:26:59.653 --> 01:27:01.696
Now, that's what l'm talkin' about!

01:27:01.697 --> 01:27:03.084
We be jammin' now!

01:27:03.449 --> 01:27:06.034
Eveyone's working
Morning 'til dawn

01:27:06.035 --> 01:27:08.277
Eveyone's singing a happy song

01:27:08.913 --> 01:27:11.623
Christmas is coming
Children are laughing

01:27:14.210 --> 01:27:15.471
This is for you.

01:27:16.129 --> 01:27:17.454
Well, what is it?

01:27:21.427 --> 01:27:22.762
- For us?
- Yeah.

01:27:23.178 --> 01:27:27.370
Girls, this is Gus.
Let's show him some Christmas cheer!

01:27:28.684 --> 01:27:32.760
This is most joyous.
There's Christmas magic to spread.

01:27:33.563 --> 01:27:36.170
Let's do this together, Santa Paws.

01:27:37.066 --> 01:27:40.664
Now, Dasher, now, Dancer,
now, Prancer and Vixen!

01:27:42.029 --> 01:27:45.190
On Comet, on Cupid,
on Donner and Blitzen!

01:27:46.033 --> 01:27:48.589
Santa is coming
Sleigh bells above

01:27:48.701 --> 01:27:51.330
Bringing his message of peace and love

01:27:51.331 --> 01:27:54.165

Let there be kindness
Peace among all

01:28:03.718 --> 01:28:06.343

Icicle brought me back.

01:28:45.718 --> 01:28:48.992

01:28:51.681 --> 01:28:53.640

01:28:57.521 --> 01:29:00.981
Thank you so much, Santa.
You've changed our lives, really.

01:29:00.982 --> 01:29:02.004
And you mine.

01:29:03.653 --> 01:29:08.575
lsn't it amazing what can happen
when we spread love and kindness?

01:29:09.198 --> 01:29:12.409
After all, that's what
Christmas is all about.

01:29:12.410 --> 01:29:12.764
Yes.

01:29:13.871 --> 01:29:18.146
- We have evemhing we ever wanted.

01:29:18.374 --> 01:29:18.792
Yeah.

01:29:23.297 --> 01:29:25.173
There is one other thing.

01:29:30.011 --> 01:29:32.556
My mom's decoration! You found it!

01:29:33.973 --> 01:29:35.611
Thank you, Santa Paws!

01:29:42.148 --> 01:29:46.632

- Of course we can. Come here.

01:29:50.990 --> 01:29:52.261

Love is home,
