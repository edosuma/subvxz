WEBVTT

00:04.105 --> 00:05.005
Previously on E.R.

00:05.039 --> 00:06.607
If it's a choice
between something serious

00:06.640 --> 00:08.276
or nothing,

00:08.309 --> 00:11.112
maybe serious is the way to go.

00:11.145 --> 00:12.446
You still on for
dinner tonight?

00:12.480 --> 00:14.715
Looks like you're
dating a teacher.

00:14.748 --> 00:17.385
I am.

00:17.418 --> 00:18.786
You take care, big man.

00:18.819 --> 00:21.489
Please don't go.

00:21.522 --> 00:23.191
I'm going to have a baby,
and Chuck's the father.

00:23.224 --> 00:24.192
You're going
to be a grandpa.

00:24.225 --> 00:25.226
You're marrying her?

00:25.259 --> 00:26.360
If she'll have me.

00:26.394 --> 00:27.528
That's it.

00:27.561 --> 00:28.529
Hey, what is that?

00:28.562 --> 00:29.663
Little bit
of Sikh rap.

00:29.697 --> 00:31.065
Wait a minute.
He's stable now.

00:31.099 --> 00:32.299
He'll be fine.
I know, but just...

00:32.333 --> 00:33.701
If I don't get out of here,

00:33.734 --> 00:34.735
I'm going to lose it.
Do you understand?

00:41.475 --> 00:43.744
Kertzenstein, Lester.

00:43.777 --> 00:45.713
Lester.

00:45.746 --> 00:47.115
Lester, Lester, Lester...

00:47.148 --> 00:48.282
Very polite.

00:48.316 --> 00:50.118
Hmm. He should try pathology.

00:50.151 --> 00:51.585
Yeah. That way, his
patients will be dead

00:51.619 --> 00:52.786
before he gets to them.

00:52.820 --> 00:54.755
I heard
he wants radiology anyway.

00:54.788 --> 00:58.759
Second tier.
Lockhart, Abby.

01:00.828 --> 01:02.296
Very strong
clinical skills.

01:02.330 --> 01:04.697
Efficient when she needs to be.

01:04.732 --> 01:06.400
Knows where to spend her time.

01:06.434 --> 01:07.535
The only person
who's not sure

01:07.568 --> 01:08.769
about Abby is Abby.

01:08.802 --> 01:10.538
Does she want
Emergency Medicine?

01:10.571 --> 01:11.739
As much as she wants anything.

01:12.606 --> 01:13.841
WEAVER:
All right.

01:13.874 --> 01:15.209
Rank to match.

01:15.243 --> 01:16.310
Rasgotra, Neela.

01:17.378 --> 01:18.646
Intelligent,
very sweet.

01:18.679 --> 01:19.813
Studious.

01:19.847 --> 01:21.215
Studious?

01:21.249 --> 01:23.384
She's the smartest one
on the floor.

01:26.354 --> 01:27.888
Come on.

01:27.921 --> 01:30.858
She could be
more assertive.

01:30.891 --> 01:32.393
CHEN:
She has a tendency
to hang back,

01:32.426 --> 01:34.162
avoid getting into traumas.

01:34.162 --> 01:35.363
She's cautious. That's good.

01:35.396 --> 01:36.464
LEWIS:
She's not ER.

01:36.497 --> 01:37.831
She'll be

01:37.865 --> 01:39.433
a star in internal medicine,
or research--

01:39.467 --> 01:40.634
something using
your intellect--

01:40.668 --> 01:42.436
but she's not an ER doc.

01:42.470 --> 01:44.338
Uh, since when
did intellect become a liability

01:44.372 --> 01:45.339
to working in the ER?

01:45.373 --> 01:46.574
WEAVER:
There was a memo

01:46.607 --> 01:47.908
while you were in Africa.

01:47.941 --> 01:49.277
I think she's excellent.

01:49.310 --> 01:50.711
She basically saved
Frank's life.

01:50.744 --> 01:52.780
She's thoughtful, yeah,
but she's deliberate.

01:52.813 --> 01:54.648
Is that code
for passive and slow?

01:54.682 --> 01:55.816
She's a student.

01:55.849 --> 01:56.917
She's going to get faster.

01:56.950 --> 01:58.319
LEWIS:
Yeah, and in
four months,

01:58.352 --> 01:59.753
she'll be a doctor.

01:59.787 --> 02:01.589
I say rank to match.

02:01.622 --> 02:03.291
That's not the consensus.

02:03.324 --> 02:05.426
Consensus is wrong.

02:05.459 --> 02:06.827
WEAVER:
Okay.

02:06.860 --> 02:09.263
The NRMP list doesn't have
to go out right away.

02:09.297 --> 02:11.299
Carter, change our minds.

02:13.534 --> 02:14.768
Well, at least
you have some time

02:14.802 --> 02:16.304
for your
reclamation project.

02:16.337 --> 02:18.272
Not really. I'm on a plane
to Africa tonight.

02:18.306 --> 02:19.407
For how long?

02:19.440 --> 02:20.608
About a week or so.

02:20.641 --> 02:21.609
How's Kem doing?

02:21.642 --> 02:23.211
She's pregnant.

02:23.244 --> 02:24.478
She asked me to fill
a suitcase with Ho-Hos.

02:24.512 --> 02:25.646
Yeah. Save some for me.

02:25.679 --> 02:27.315
I need you to sign
off on these dispos?

02:27.348 --> 02:28.482
My shift's over.

02:28.516 --> 02:29.817
14 hours isn't enough?

02:29.850 --> 02:32.220
Dr. Carter, 27-year-old
healthy male,

02:32.253 --> 02:33.554
knee versus circular saw.

02:33.587 --> 02:35.389
Chuck said he'd be
waiting for you outside.

02:35.423 --> 02:37.458
Chivalry-- time of death, 8:07.

02:37.491 --> 02:38.592
How long has he been here?

02:38.626 --> 02:39.893
Sat in triage
for seven hours,

02:39.927 --> 02:41.495
and back in a room
for the last two.

02:41.529 --> 02:43.497
Good luck, Carter.

02:43.531 --> 02:44.665
Um, you irrigated, yeah?

02:44.698 --> 02:45.899
I was concerned

02:45.933 --> 02:47.835
that the lac might extend
to the joint.

02:47.868 --> 02:49.237
For nine hours?

02:49.237 --> 02:51.239
Well, I thought
I should wait on you.

02:51.239 --> 02:53.341
You think Ike's
serving burgers
this early?

02:53.374 --> 02:55.309
I really
need a burger.

02:55.343 --> 02:56.810
What is up with you?

02:56.844 --> 02:58.346
I think we've
got a case

02:58.379 --> 03:00.614
of, uh, sympathetic
pregnancy going on here.

03:00.648 --> 03:01.982
Excuse me?

03:02.015 --> 03:05.253
I have all the
symptoms-- nausea, gas,

03:05.253 --> 03:07.921
increased salivation,
cravings.

03:07.955 --> 03:09.357
I got to pee
all the time.

03:09.390 --> 03:12.893
You had all that
before I got pregnant.

03:12.926 --> 03:14.528
You know what?
I have to sit down.

03:14.562 --> 03:16.364
Just get me whatever
you're getting, okay?

03:16.397 --> 03:17.531
All right. See?

03:17.565 --> 03:19.567
We're together in this.

03:21.269 --> 03:23.271
( sighs ):
Oh.

03:25.306 --> 03:26.507
Morning.

03:26.540 --> 03:29.310
Morning.

03:29.343 --> 03:31.812
When are you due?

03:31.845 --> 03:33.447
Oh, another month or so.

03:33.481 --> 03:35.383
I love kids.

03:35.416 --> 03:37.318
When my wife was
pregnant with ours,

03:37.351 --> 03:39.420
it was... it was
the best thing ever.

03:39.453 --> 03:40.954
Yeah, it's pretty great.

03:40.988 --> 03:42.890
Yeah. We're divorced now.

03:42.923 --> 03:44.325
Oh, I'm sorry.

03:46.327 --> 03:48.629
Women are never more beautiful
than when they're pregnant.

03:48.662 --> 03:49.963
( laughs ):
Ooh.

03:49.997 --> 03:52.700
I wish it felt that way.

03:52.733 --> 03:53.834
Hey...

03:57.004 --> 04:00.308
don't let anyone ever
tell you you're not sexy.

04:00.341 --> 04:04.312
Because you are sexy.

04:04.345 --> 04:05.313
Thank you.

04:05.346 --> 04:06.514
Any real man

04:06.547 --> 04:08.816
knows that
there's nothing better

04:08.849 --> 04:11.352
than making love
to a round, smooth,

04:11.385 --> 04:13.354
nurturing, mother-to-be.

04:15.489 --> 04:16.990
I-I hope you don't take that
the wrong way.

04:17.024 --> 04:18.692
There's a right
way to take that?

04:18.726 --> 04:19.860
I didn't mean to offend you.

04:19.892 --> 04:21.028
You know what?
It's okay.

04:21.060 --> 04:22.363
Can I touch it?

04:22.396 --> 04:23.431
Excuse me?

04:23.464 --> 04:24.665
Your belly-- can I touch it?

04:24.698 --> 04:26.800
CHUCK:
Whoa, hey,
what's going on?

04:26.834 --> 04:27.835
You know what?
We need to go.

04:27.868 --> 04:28.836
What are you doing?

04:28.869 --> 04:30.571
I was just talking to the lady.

04:30.604 --> 04:32.540
He wanted to
touch my belly.
Was he hitting on you?

04:32.573 --> 04:34.675
Ease up, pal. I don't see a ring
on her finger.

04:34.708 --> 04:35.843
Oh.

04:35.876 --> 04:37.545
( grunts )

04:37.578 --> 04:39.046
Whoa.

04:39.079 --> 04:40.414
Oh, God, my lip.

04:40.448 --> 04:42.916
Must be the hormones.

04:44.000 --> 04:50.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

05:36.103 --> 05:36.970
It was flagrant assault.

05:37.004 --> 05:38.572
I already called the cops.

05:38.606 --> 05:40.674
My lawyer's
on the way.
You molested me first.

05:40.708 --> 05:42.009
I asked you
an innocent question.

05:42.042 --> 05:43.611
It was not innocent.

05:43.644 --> 05:45.479
That caveman decked me
for exercising

05:45.513 --> 05:47.515
my freedom of speech.

05:47.548 --> 05:49.049
Sit still. As long
as I'm stitching your lip,

05:49.082 --> 05:50.484
you have no freedom of speech.

05:50.518 --> 05:52.085
He was defending me.

05:52.119 --> 05:52.786
You didn't need

05:52.820 --> 05:53.687
defending.

05:53.721 --> 05:55.656
I was just being friendly.

05:55.689 --> 05:57.425
KOVAC:
Order a
nasal series

05:57.425 --> 05:59.427
and let me know when
his X rays are back.

06:01.061 --> 06:02.630
Aah! What a creep.

06:02.663 --> 06:04.565
Chuck could have
punched him
in his teeth.

06:04.598 --> 06:05.666
That way, they
can't talk.

06:05.699 --> 06:06.667
Did he apologize?

06:06.700 --> 06:08.001
No, but he
called the cops.

06:08.035 --> 06:09.637
To what,
to turn himself in?

06:09.670 --> 06:11.672
No. Come on, we have
to have a little chat.

06:11.705 --> 06:13.507
TAGGART:
Oh, no, I understand.

06:13.541 --> 06:14.842
Yeah, have a great time.

06:14.875 --> 06:16.043
Yeah, next weekend.

06:17.144 --> 06:18.446
Good morning.

06:18.479 --> 06:19.012
Hey there.

06:19.046 --> 06:20.681
What's wrong?

06:20.714 --> 06:22.015
Oh, it's Alex's
birthday tomorrow.

06:22.049 --> 06:23.817
Yeah, I heard.

06:23.851 --> 06:25.486
Well, I wanted
to throw him a
party or something,

06:25.519 --> 06:26.754
but Austin's
his only friend,

06:26.787 --> 06:27.788
and his folks are
taking him skiing

06:27.821 --> 06:28.856
for the weekend.

06:28.889 --> 06:30.558
Get him a clown.
Yeah, good idea.

06:30.591 --> 06:31.859
What's wrong
with a clown?

06:31.892 --> 06:33.461
Kids love clowns.

06:33.461 --> 06:35.696
CARTER:
Okay, next time,
just inject 5cc's

06:35.729 --> 06:36.764
of sterile fluroscein

06:36.797 --> 06:38.098
and observe
under a woods lamp.

06:38.131 --> 06:39.733
I wasn't sure about
the fluroscein.

06:39.767 --> 06:41.602
Well, then come find me.
Don't just wait, okay?

06:41.635 --> 06:43.170
I didn't want to
interrupt the meeting.

06:43.203 --> 06:44.772
Neela, we were ranking

06:44.805 --> 06:46.740
fourth year med students
in there,

06:46.774 --> 06:48.141
and everybody agreed
that you're really bright,

06:48.175 --> 06:49.543
and we really like
working with you.

06:49.577 --> 06:50.644
Someone spoke
poorly of me?

06:50.678 --> 06:51.745
Well, nobody in particular.

06:51.779 --> 06:53.113
Was it Dr. Chen?

06:53.146 --> 06:54.548
Because she's had it
in for me...

06:54.582 --> 06:56.149
Neela, you have
to be more decisive.

06:56.183 --> 06:57.518
Okay, you have to be more

06:57.551 --> 06:58.552
proactive.

06:58.586 --> 06:59.687
They feel I'm too passive?

06:59.720 --> 07:00.921
Tell you want--

07:00.954 --> 07:02.790
for the next four hours,
you are a doctor.

07:02.823 --> 07:05.526
I want you to carry a minimum
of three patients at all times.

07:05.559 --> 07:07.528
LOCKHART:
Rescue 37,
county base, go ahead.

07:07.561 --> 07:08.729
Start their workups,
order the labs and meds,

07:08.762 --> 07:10.598
and present back
to me only after

07:10.631 --> 07:12.232
you've put your
own diagnostic
plan into action.

07:12.265 --> 07:13.967
Today, you're a shark.

07:14.001 --> 07:15.035
Shark?

07:15.068 --> 07:16.136
Keep swimming,

07:16.169 --> 07:17.237
or you die.

07:17.270 --> 07:19.006
Car versus nursing home
medi-van.

07:19.039 --> 07:21.141
We're getting the driver
and at least two passengers.

07:21.174 --> 07:22.876
Anybody unstable?

07:22.910 --> 07:24.778
Good vitals on all of them,
ETA nine minutes.

07:24.812 --> 07:25.813
I've got the first.
Okay.

07:25.846 --> 07:27.214
Okay, so work up these three.

07:27.247 --> 07:29.216
In fact, just work up
these two. That's enough.

07:29.249 --> 07:31.719
And then go help Gallant.

07:31.752 --> 07:33.554
PRATT:
Hey, Mike...

07:33.587 --> 07:34.922
( sighs )

07:34.955 --> 07:36.790
...I'm leaving that stripper
in curtain four

07:36.824 --> 07:38.626
with the broken toe
just for you.
Try not to TUBE her.

07:38.659 --> 07:39.893
What? What are
you talking about?

07:39.927 --> 07:41.895
Totally Unnecessary Breast Exam.

07:41.929 --> 07:43.997
I think you're projecting.

07:44.031 --> 07:45.566
Oh, Michael, hi.

07:45.599 --> 07:47.968
New onset seizure needs
to go to medicine,

07:48.001 --> 07:50.237
post-op appy with
fever needs a belly CT.

07:50.270 --> 07:51.839
Call me if there's
a problem.

07:51.872 --> 07:53.006
Got you.

07:53.040 --> 07:54.542
You feel like buying
me some breakfast?

07:54.575 --> 07:56.043
Maybe another time.

07:56.076 --> 07:57.811
Deb, there's a lady
waiting for you in Triage.

07:57.845 --> 07:59.747
Gallant can take her.
Uh, it's not
a patient.

07:59.780 --> 08:01.749
She's a nurse.
She says she
works for you.

08:02.783 --> 08:05.018
Have a good shift, Neela.

08:06.720 --> 08:08.088
Lucia?

08:08.121 --> 08:09.256
I'm sorry to bother
you at work.

08:09.289 --> 08:10.891
Did something happen
with my dad?

08:10.924 --> 08:12.893
No, the night nurse
agreed to stay late.

08:14.261 --> 08:16.263
I'm not coming back.

08:16.296 --> 08:18.131
Your father won't
wear the diaper,

08:18.165 --> 08:19.600
he throws food at me.

08:19.633 --> 08:20.801
When I try to
help dress him,

08:20.834 --> 08:22.102
he yells very
bad words.

08:22.135 --> 08:24.104
I-I appreciate your patience.

08:24.137 --> 08:25.272
( sighs )

08:25.305 --> 08:27.274
You know, this isn't really him.

08:27.307 --> 08:29.810
I know he's a
very good man,
Dr. Chen, but,

08:29.843 --> 08:32.580
I can't do it anymore.

08:32.580 --> 08:33.780
Look, if you could just
give me a few days

08:33.813 --> 08:35.148
until I can get a replacement?

08:35.182 --> 08:36.583
Here is my address.

08:36.616 --> 08:37.951
You can send my
last check there.

08:37.985 --> 08:40.253
And give him
this for me.

08:40.287 --> 08:41.254
Lucia...

08:41.288 --> 08:42.722
I pray for him.

08:47.828 --> 08:49.963
I don't like working
on old people.

08:49.997 --> 08:51.965
Or children.
Or drunks.

08:51.999 --> 08:54.067
And what's
with all the sick people?

08:54.101 --> 08:55.903
They make it such a drag, huh?

08:55.936 --> 08:57.805
Listen, he's just
motivating you.

08:57.838 --> 08:59.707
For the match rankings.

08:59.740 --> 09:01.041
You know, maybe
they're right.

09:01.074 --> 09:02.610
Maybe this job's
just too...

09:02.610 --> 09:03.644
fast for me, too
unpredictable.

09:03.677 --> 09:04.845
It's a big hospital.

09:04.878 --> 09:05.913
If the ER's not a good fit...

09:05.946 --> 09:07.615
Then what?

09:07.615 --> 09:09.016
The NICU made me want
to jump off the roof.

09:09.049 --> 09:10.217
Pedes is filled
with screaming brats

09:10.250 --> 09:11.785
and anxious parents.

09:11.819 --> 09:13.954
And OB/GYN's a
lifetime of overnights

09:13.987 --> 09:15.288
and malpractice suits.

09:15.322 --> 09:17.324
I could go into
research or teaching,

09:17.357 --> 09:19.627
but is that really why
I became a doctor?

09:21.028 --> 09:23.063
I'm sorry.
Were you talking to me?

09:24.131 --> 09:25.633
( laughs )

09:25.633 --> 09:27.701
This-This place is so
up-and-down.

09:27.735 --> 09:30.804
I mean, you learn
to ride through the rough days.

09:30.838 --> 09:32.706
I did.

09:32.740 --> 09:34.241
You were probably
good from the start.

09:34.274 --> 09:36.143
Are you kidding me?

09:36.176 --> 09:39.179
I came in young,
dumb and scared.

09:39.212 --> 09:42.816
At least you--
you're good with the books.

09:42.850 --> 09:45.152
You really
like it here?

09:45.185 --> 09:47.655
I wouldn't stay if I didn't.

09:47.688 --> 09:49.389
MAN:
Luis Sanchez, MVA passenger.

09:49.422 --> 09:52.125
Deformed upper right leg,
probable femur fracture.

09:52.159 --> 09:53.661
Oh, ouches. Don't!

09:53.661 --> 09:54.828
You give anything
for pain?

09:54.862 --> 09:55.796
Pressure's too low--
90/70.

09:55.829 --> 09:57.698
He's from a nursing home?

09:57.731 --> 09:59.667
Make it stop. It hurts.
Is this a change
in mental status?

09:59.667 --> 10:01.234
I don't think
it's from the crash.

10:01.268 --> 10:03.637
Nursing home said
he fell off a roof in December.

10:03.671 --> 10:05.038
Can you call my wife?
I have a wife.

10:05.072 --> 10:06.173
I think he's got

10:06.206 --> 10:07.875
some kind
of traumatic brain injury.

10:07.908 --> 10:09.710
Lower extremity fracture
with borderline pressure.

10:09.743 --> 10:12.145
Need to rule out
an intra-abdominal bleed.
Trauma one.

10:12.179 --> 10:13.380
Two more MVA's rolling
in behind.

10:13.413 --> 10:16.116
( pained wailing )
Okay, on my way.

10:16.149 --> 10:17.117
Can we medicate him?

10:17.150 --> 10:18.251
Once his pressure's up.

10:18.285 --> 10:19.720
LOCKHART:
Here's the SonoSite.

10:19.753 --> 10:21.321
Two liters of saline
wide open.

10:21.354 --> 10:22.956
Maybe we can draw up analgesics?

10:22.990 --> 10:24.692
Luis, do you have
any allergies?

10:24.725 --> 10:25.893
I don't know,
I don't know.

10:25.926 --> 10:28.228
Are you taking any medications?

10:28.261 --> 10:30.030
Mary gives me my pills.

10:30.063 --> 10:31.331
What kind of pills?

10:31.364 --> 10:33.333
A blue, a green,
and three white.

10:33.366 --> 10:34.234
Okay, Morrison's
looks good.

10:34.267 --> 10:35.769
No blood in the belly.

10:35.803 --> 10:38.205
Pressure's up to 100.
Can we push morphine?

10:38.238 --> 10:39.707
We need a med list
and allergy history first.

10:39.740 --> 10:41.341
Call the home.
Make it stop!
It hurts!

10:41.374 --> 10:43.076
Pocket Doppler
and Surgilube for
the pedal pulses.

10:43.110 --> 10:44.077
I don't like.

10:44.111 --> 10:44.912
Cole's potassium is 3.2.

10:44.945 --> 10:46.079
40 of K-Dur p.o.

10:46.113 --> 10:47.380
Suze, I'm
not going
to do it.

10:47.414 --> 10:48.448
Then he's going
to press charges.

10:48.481 --> 10:50.250
I have a couple
of other things.

10:50.283 --> 10:52.185
Hey, we're the ones
who should be pressing charges.

10:52.219 --> 10:53.954
Yes, this is
Neela Rasgotra
from County.

10:53.987 --> 10:55.956
For what? Having a uniquely
disturbing pick-up line?

10:55.989 --> 10:58.191
I need to speak to a nurse
taking care of a Luis Sanchez.

10:58.225 --> 11:00.393
I believe the name's Mary?
Just say
you're sorry.

11:00.427 --> 11:01.829
They're done
patching up
your freak.

11:01.862 --> 11:03.731
Give a half bolus,
seven per kilo IV.

11:03.731 --> 11:04.998
When will the nurse
be available?

11:05.032 --> 11:06.767
Can you read me the list
from the chart then?

11:06.800 --> 11:09.069
Why not?
Can Mrs. Herrero eat?

11:09.102 --> 11:10.771
Two gram sodium diet,
1800 calorie ADA.

11:10.804 --> 11:12.339
I'm sorry
you've had a bad morning, sir,

11:12.372 --> 11:14.041
but Luis Sanchez has had
an even worse one,

11:14.074 --> 11:15.743
so could you please
fax us the med list

11:15.776 --> 11:16.744
as soon as possible?

11:16.777 --> 11:18.779
( screams )

11:24.852 --> 11:26.019
How about a magician?

11:26.053 --> 11:27.287
Magicians are cool.

11:27.320 --> 11:29.857
Last year he wanted
a pig embryo to dissect.

11:29.890 --> 11:32.392
You really think
a magician's gonna do it?

11:32.425 --> 11:34.928
Lucy Kilmer, another van
passenger from the nursing home.

11:34.962 --> 11:36.930
History of laryngeal cancer,
complains of low back pain.

11:36.964 --> 11:37.798
Where was she sitting?

11:37.831 --> 11:38.866
Middle row, belted.

11:38.899 --> 11:39.967
Vitals good,
resps 12.

11:40.000 --> 11:41.234
Any belly pain, ma'am?

11:42.369 --> 11:45.072
No. I'm okay.

11:45.105 --> 11:47.107
Carter needs some help
with the van driver.

11:47.140 --> 11:49.142
I have just the thing
for him-- paint ball.

11:49.176 --> 11:50.811
Good idea, put a
gun in his hand.

11:50.844 --> 11:52.145
50 more of fent is in.

11:52.179 --> 11:54.147
Flail segment on the left
with hemo pneumo.

11:54.181 --> 11:56.316
Betadine and size eight
sterile gloves.

11:56.349 --> 11:57.818
What do you need?

11:57.851 --> 11:59.787
Tachy at 126.
The guy next door
needs meds

11:59.787 --> 12:00.821
but we have no drug
records or reliable
medical history.

12:00.854 --> 12:02.790
Call the nursing home.
I did.

12:02.790 --> 12:04.091
They're going to get back, but I
doubt it will be very quickly.

12:04.124 --> 12:05.425
You tell them it was urgent?

12:05.458 --> 12:07.127
They seemed very disorganized.
I'll need

12:07.160 --> 12:08.896
a second thoraseal
on the other side.

12:08.929 --> 12:10.363
Mr. Joss, do you keep paperwork
on the patients you drive?

12:10.397 --> 12:12.265
He's not breathing.

12:12.299 --> 12:13.967
Give me some in-line traction
and let's get ready to bag him.

12:14.001 --> 12:15.268
Need a doctor in here.

12:15.302 --> 12:16.804
The lady's having trouble
with her trake.

12:16.804 --> 12:17.971
Ten blade,
and a 32 French.

12:18.005 --> 12:19.339
Neela, go with Sam.

12:19.372 --> 12:21.508
BP holding at 106 systolic,
sats still 91.

12:21.541 --> 12:23.811
Okay, bag him up.

12:23.844 --> 12:24.978
Her trake is out.

12:25.012 --> 12:26.046
She must have
just pulled it.

12:26.079 --> 12:27.815
She needs a new one.

12:27.848 --> 12:29.983
Number four
shiley, uncuffed.

12:35.856 --> 12:37.057
Okay, I'll call a doctor.

12:37.090 --> 12:38.425
No, no, I can do it.

12:41.361 --> 12:42.395
You need some Surgilube.

12:42.429 --> 12:43.496
Right.

12:43.530 --> 12:45.498
Okay, ma'am,
extend your neck

12:45.532 --> 12:48.268
and look up
at the ceiling.

12:48.301 --> 12:49.970
On your third breath.
Ready?

12:50.003 --> 12:52.339
In, out.

12:52.372 --> 12:53.540
In, out.

12:53.573 --> 12:54.875
Big breath in...

12:54.908 --> 12:55.976
( inhales deeply )

12:56.009 --> 12:58.879
( coughing )

12:58.912 --> 12:59.579
Pulse ox is coming up.

12:59.612 --> 13:00.513
Let's tie it in.

13:00.547 --> 13:02.149
Got it.

13:04.184 --> 13:05.853
Thank you.

13:05.886 --> 13:07.287
Doctors?

13:07.320 --> 13:09.389
We don't need
no stinking doctors.

13:10.557 --> 13:11.992
Neela!

13:12.025 --> 13:13.360
She could use some ice chips.

13:14.194 --> 13:15.495
Sats are coming up.

13:15.528 --> 13:18.031
Transport information
on the passengers.

13:18.065 --> 13:19.867
Found it in his jacket.
Go. Go!

13:19.867 --> 13:21.101
Into the pleural space,
chest tube's in.

13:21.134 --> 13:23.070
Systolic's up to 120
after two liters.

13:23.103 --> 13:25.272
I've got the discharge summary
from the last hospital visit.

13:25.305 --> 13:27.040
Okay, when was it?
Three weeks ago.

13:27.074 --> 13:28.441
Good. Good enough.

13:28.475 --> 13:30.543
Dr. Gallant, Mr. Anderson
is vomiting blood in CT.

13:30.577 --> 13:33.280
Okay, titrate morphine to pain,
start with four milligrams.

13:33.313 --> 13:36.183
Hemocue's 15, I don't think
he has any internal bleeding.

13:36.216 --> 13:37.450
Stop. Not the morphine.

13:37.484 --> 13:39.186
Violent nausea
and vomiting with morphine

13:39.219 --> 13:40.587
during his last
hospitalization.

13:40.620 --> 13:41.955
What do you want to do?

13:44.024 --> 13:45.893
I'll be right back.

13:45.893 --> 13:47.060
LEWIS:
Jerry, tell him.

13:47.094 --> 13:48.595
It is not unmanly
to apologize.

13:48.628 --> 13:50.530
Come on, just do it
and let's get out of here.

13:50.563 --> 13:51.598
I'm exhausted.

13:51.631 --> 13:52.933
Okay, okay,
I'm going in.

13:52.966 --> 13:54.401
Did Dr. Gallant go to CT yet?

13:54.434 --> 13:55.903
Yeah, he's already
down there.

13:55.936 --> 13:57.304
Has there been a fax for me?

13:57.337 --> 13:58.906
Were you waiting
on a price list

13:58.939 --> 14:00.340
from Crazy Joe's
Party Supply?

14:00.373 --> 14:01.608
Yeah, who knew piñatas
were so pricey?

14:01.641 --> 14:03.010
Damn it.

14:03.043 --> 14:05.045
Is everything
okay, Neela?

14:05.078 --> 14:06.546
I've got it taken care of.

14:06.579 --> 14:07.915
Neela,
Mr. Lavecchia's

14:07.915 --> 14:09.416
urine is four plus for blood.

14:09.449 --> 14:10.483
Uh, kidney stone.
Push 30 of Toradol.

14:10.517 --> 14:12.285
I pulled Demerol.

14:12.319 --> 14:14.587
No, give the Toradol 15 minutes
to work before we try narcotics.

14:14.621 --> 14:15.956
All right, I'll put it away.

14:15.989 --> 14:17.925
No, I'll take it.

14:17.925 --> 14:20.260
( groaning )

14:21.261 --> 14:22.395
Pain scale eight out of ten.

14:22.429 --> 14:23.630
We need to give him something.

14:23.663 --> 14:25.132
The discharge
summary says

14:25.165 --> 14:26.399
he got post-op Demerol
in the hospital.

14:26.433 --> 14:27.634
Good. How much?

14:27.667 --> 14:29.102
Abby, triple lumen CVP kit?

14:29.136 --> 14:30.303
Go ahead.
I'll take care of it.

14:30.337 --> 14:31.638
Oh, please...

14:31.671 --> 14:33.106
Please stop hurting...

14:33.140 --> 14:35.008
Please.

14:35.042 --> 14:39.546
All right, Luis, this is going
to make you feel much better.

14:39.579 --> 14:42.015
( crying )

14:43.483 --> 14:45.585
It's so sweet
to see them growing.

14:45.618 --> 14:46.353
Babies?

14:46.386 --> 14:48.121
Men.

14:48.155 --> 14:50.523
Dr. Lewis, Mr. Hemorrhoid
in Three is asking for you.

14:50.557 --> 14:54.527
Oh, no, I'm not here.
I left an hour ago.

14:54.561 --> 14:56.029
( loud crash )
Crazy bastard!

14:56.063 --> 14:58.265
Get off me!
Pull his hair!

14:58.298 --> 14:59.266
Ow!

14:59.299 --> 15:00.400
Chuck, stop!

15:00.433 --> 15:02.369
Kick him!

15:04.204 --> 15:05.605
Oh, my God!

15:05.638 --> 15:06.974
( laughing )

15:07.007 --> 15:09.176
Stop it, Chuck.

15:10.110 --> 15:12.045
Get your hands off me.

15:12.079 --> 15:13.446
Come on,
come on, guys.

15:13.480 --> 15:14.581
Come on, Chuck.

15:14.614 --> 15:18.451
Okay.
All right, all right.

15:19.686 --> 15:21.454
It don't hurt no more.

15:21.488 --> 15:23.123
You made it go away.

15:23.156 --> 15:26.159
Isolated femur fracture
awaiting ortho.

15:26.193 --> 15:27.594
No evidence of
occult blood loss,

15:27.627 --> 15:29.229
vitals stable,
medicated for pain.

15:29.262 --> 15:31.531
Good. Wheezing in two,
sudden onset visual loss

15:31.564 --> 15:33.200
in the eye room.
Which one should I take?

15:33.233 --> 15:35.202
Both.

15:35.235 --> 15:37.104
Keep it up.

15:42.275 --> 15:43.576
I never touched the guy.

15:43.610 --> 15:45.412
He says you handled him
in an aggressive manner.

15:45.445 --> 15:46.746
She handled him?
In his dreams.

15:46.779 --> 15:48.448
There are a number
of potential lawsuits here.

15:48.481 --> 15:50.150
Oh, you gotta
be kidding me.

15:50.183 --> 15:52.352
In addition to the hospital
and the Emergency Department,

15:52.385 --> 15:55.155
he's threatened to sue
the city, the county
and the Fire Department.

15:55.188 --> 15:56.089
I'm not even
on duty.

15:56.123 --> 15:57.357
I need this
to go away.

15:57.390 --> 15:59.526
So either I get the lawyers
down here or...

15:59.559 --> 16:01.161
No, fine,
I will talk to him.

16:01.194 --> 16:02.195
What? No. No.

16:02.229 --> 16:03.263
He's weird, not nuts.

16:03.296 --> 16:06.433
I will talk some sense into him.

16:10.737 --> 16:13.040
The hernia's trapped outside
the abdominal wall.

16:13.073 --> 16:14.507
Is that bad?
You ready to round?

16:14.541 --> 16:15.575
Deep breath, Bobby.

16:15.608 --> 16:18.145
( inhales deeply )

16:18.178 --> 16:19.246
Better?
Yeah, thanks.

16:19.279 --> 16:20.547
A surgeon will come see you.

16:20.580 --> 16:23.216
It's a straightforward
procedure,

16:23.250 --> 16:24.151
nothing to worry about.

16:24.184 --> 16:25.118
Cool.
Inguinal hernia?

16:25.152 --> 16:26.419
Incarcerated.

16:26.453 --> 16:28.221
Reduced without sedation--
the kid's tough.

16:28.255 --> 16:31.258
20-year-old asthmatic,
came in with a sat of 89.

16:31.291 --> 16:34.727
On his third albuterol with
atrovent, received 60 of pred.

16:34.761 --> 16:37.064
Aeration's improved
but still 92 on room air.

16:37.097 --> 16:38.065
Did you call medicine?

16:38.098 --> 16:39.066
They're on their way.

16:39.099 --> 16:40.533
Can I get
some more water?

16:40.567 --> 16:42.502
Tigerlilly Lee, 24,
complaining of cotton mouth.

16:42.535 --> 16:44.471
I'm like parched
all the time.

16:44.504 --> 16:48.341
History of polydipsia led me
to check her blood sugar-- 642.

16:48.375 --> 16:50.343
New onset diabetes,
not DKA'ing yet.

16:50.377 --> 16:51.578
You should give ten...

16:51.611 --> 16:53.313
Ten units of regular insulin,

16:53.346 --> 16:55.782
two liters of saline
and I consulted endocrine.

16:55.815 --> 16:57.117
Back to bed.

16:59.352 --> 17:00.787
Hey!

17:00.820 --> 17:02.422
( quietly ):
Very good.

17:02.455 --> 17:05.092
She's looking much better.

17:05.092 --> 17:06.726
Yeah, back to her usual self.

17:06.759 --> 17:08.328
Viral gastroenteritis.

17:08.361 --> 17:10.497
I consulted Kovac,
as you were too busy.

17:10.530 --> 17:11.731
Thanks for your help,
doctor.

17:11.763 --> 17:13.665
Mr. Silvio,
four ounces every hour,

17:13.700 --> 17:16.803
and don't let her chug 'cause
she'll just throw it back up.

17:16.836 --> 17:19.439
Oral rehydration,
avoided an IV,
in and out in an hour.

17:19.472 --> 17:21.273
The girl is on fire.
Yeah, you told us so.

17:21.308 --> 17:23.210
I told you so.

17:23.242 --> 17:24.310
Told you what?

17:24.344 --> 17:26.113
Nothing.
Attending gossip.

17:26.146 --> 17:28.115
Hey, did you check out
the van driver?

17:28.115 --> 17:30.417
Uh, yes. He needs an
exploratory laparotomy.

17:30.450 --> 17:31.518
We're moving him up.

17:31.551 --> 17:33.286
So?

17:33.320 --> 17:35.822
His lungs re-expanded,
350cc's out the left tube...

17:35.855 --> 17:37.357
No, no, no, no.
Not that.

17:37.390 --> 17:38.658
Last night, the surgeon.

17:38.691 --> 17:43.696
Oh. Uh, it was...
splendid.

17:43.730 --> 17:46.799
Is that British
for "sweaty and hot"?

17:46.833 --> 17:48.401
I don't kiss
and tell.

17:48.435 --> 17:50.670
Abby, radiology's bouncing back
your patient.

17:50.703 --> 17:52.372
Temp's up
and he's unresponsive.

17:52.405 --> 17:53.873
I'm gonna need
some dirt later.

17:53.906 --> 17:55.275
Our gift shop sucks.

17:55.308 --> 17:57.210
You couldn't
find anything?

17:57.244 --> 17:58.678
The best I could do
is a novelized version
of the Matrix Reloaded.

17:58.711 --> 18:01.881
I had them fax over a
menu so you could see.

18:01.914 --> 18:03.850
"Mr. Hyde's Tavern."

18:03.883 --> 18:05.785
It's a haunted
mansion restaurant.

18:05.818 --> 18:08.288
Strawberry bloodshake?
Tarantula fries?

18:08.321 --> 18:09.889
That's cool, right?

18:09.922 --> 18:12.692
I want it to be something he'll
remember, something special.

18:12.725 --> 18:14.794
What, a bloodshake's
not special?

18:14.827 --> 18:16.429
This is Frederika Torrez.

18:16.463 --> 18:20.200
Hurt her ankle during tennis
team practice.

18:20.233 --> 18:21.701
Who put this on?

18:21.734 --> 18:22.635
Sister Margaret.
Um, she's my coach.

18:22.669 --> 18:24.671
Did she come with you?

18:24.704 --> 18:26.873
Yeah, she's out
in the waiting room
with the other girls.

18:26.906 --> 18:28.208
Did you roll it
inside or out?

18:28.241 --> 18:29.842
Uh... I can't really remember.

18:29.876 --> 18:31.578
SAM:
The toenail's bruised.

18:31.611 --> 18:34.214
Did you do anything else
besides twisting it?

18:34.247 --> 18:35.882
I don't think so.

18:35.915 --> 18:39.786
Are you sure you didn't jam
your toe, or kick something?

18:39.819 --> 18:41.921
Okay, there's this
really creepy guy

18:41.954 --> 18:44.657
who keeps on flashing us
during practice

18:44.691 --> 18:45.925
from outside
the fence.

18:45.958 --> 18:47.527
You know, opening his coat

18:47.560 --> 18:48.928
and he's naked underneath.

18:48.961 --> 18:51.198
I mean totally.
It's really gross.

18:51.231 --> 18:53.366
Yeah, I bet.
Sister Margaret
called the cops

18:53.400 --> 18:54.934
last time, but he got away
before they showed up.

18:54.967 --> 18:56.203
Uh-huh...

18:56.236 --> 18:58.405
So today we just
got sick of it,

18:58.438 --> 19:00.773
and we all ran out after him.
Got some pretty good whacks in
before he got away.

19:00.807 --> 19:02.542
You beat this man up?

19:02.575 --> 19:04.711
Sister Margaret
also teaches us
self-defense.

19:04.744 --> 19:05.812
She's cool.

19:07.314 --> 19:08.948
How bad did you hurt him?

19:08.981 --> 19:11.718
I'm pretty sure
we kicked his ass.

19:11.751 --> 19:13.320
Need a little help here.

19:13.353 --> 19:15.255
He's unresponsive,
temp's 105.8.

19:15.288 --> 19:16.923
He didn't have a fever
before. Luis? Luis.

19:16.956 --> 19:18.791
He needs a septic workup.

19:18.825 --> 19:21.361
CBC, blood cultures times two,
cathed UA, and do a spinal tap?

19:21.394 --> 19:22.695
Yeah, rule encephalitis
and meningitis.

19:22.729 --> 19:23.696
Oh, no.

19:23.730 --> 19:24.697
All right, roll him.

19:24.731 --> 19:26.233
You want Ativan?
Four migs.

19:26.233 --> 19:27.700
Come on, push it.
Is he on aphenothiazine?

19:27.734 --> 19:29.336
What does the medical
record say?

19:29.369 --> 19:30.937
I'll see if it came in.

19:30.970 --> 19:32.739
You didn't get it yet?

19:32.772 --> 19:34.374
Doctor, the headache's worse.

19:34.407 --> 19:35.908
I'll have the nurse give you
another shot.

19:35.942 --> 19:37.410
Did you look
at my X-rays yet?

19:37.444 --> 19:38.645
Soon, Mrs. Jenkins.
Hey, slow down, girl,

19:38.678 --> 19:39.779
you're showing us all up.

19:39.812 --> 19:41.248
Luis Sanchez
is seizing.
Who?

19:41.248 --> 19:42.649
Brain injury guy
from the nursing home.

19:42.682 --> 19:44.251
I thought he was stable.
Not anymore.

19:44.284 --> 19:45.418
Six of ativan on board.

19:45.452 --> 19:46.386
And load a gram
of dilantin.

19:46.419 --> 19:47.654
I've got the
med list.

19:47.687 --> 19:49.922
Why didn't you
have it before?

19:49.956 --> 19:51.458
The fax wasn't in.
The driver's transfer record
was only three weeks old.

19:51.491 --> 19:53.326
All right,
read it to me.

19:53.360 --> 19:54.894
Baclofen, Omeprazole,
Keflex, Tolterodine.

19:54.927 --> 19:56.363
The only thing new is they
switched his antidepressant

19:56.396 --> 19:58.531
two weeks ago-- Phenelzine?

19:58.565 --> 19:59.766
It's a monoamine
oxidase inhibitor.

19:59.799 --> 20:01.334
What'd you
give him?

20:01.368 --> 20:02.769
Morphine.
All right, we
need to start

20:02.802 --> 20:03.703
thinking about
an airway.
No, Demerol.

20:03.736 --> 20:04.937
You gave him
Demerol?

20:04.971 --> 20:06.439
He had nausea with morphine,
so...

20:06.473 --> 20:07.240
Oh, God, it's
serotonin syndrome.

20:07.274 --> 20:08.641
What?

20:08.675 --> 20:09.742
You never give Demerol
with an MAO inhibitor.

20:09.776 --> 20:10.910
It can be fatal.

20:10.943 --> 20:12.512
Let's get him on O2
at 15 liters.

20:12.545 --> 20:13.613
Spinal tap,
come on.

20:13.646 --> 20:14.914
Prep and drape!

20:14.947 --> 20:16.983
WEAVER:
Your better half got that idiot

20:17.016 --> 20:19.586
to drop the whole thing.

20:19.619 --> 20:20.587
She did?

20:20.620 --> 20:21.888
What do we have to do?

20:21.921 --> 20:23.890
You don't have to do anything.

20:30.663 --> 20:33.466
Do you mind if I lift your shirt
up a little bit?

20:33.500 --> 20:35.802
Don't push your luck, creep.

20:41.040 --> 20:43.543
( mouthing words )

20:43.576 --> 20:46.012
Don't worry. I'll get Chuni
to put battery acid in his IV.

20:46.045 --> 20:49.282
Hey, Jerry, will you check
on my X-rays?

20:49.316 --> 20:50.450
What's up with you?

20:50.483 --> 20:52.652
I defended Susan
from some freak.

20:52.685 --> 20:55.288
And ended up getting
her molested.

20:55.322 --> 20:57.990
I can't watch this anymore.

20:58.024 --> 21:00.560
George Deakins, mugged under
the Michigan Avenue bridge.

21:00.593 --> 21:02.329
Lovely spring day.

21:02.329 --> 21:03.763
You'd think you could
take a walk by the river.

21:03.796 --> 21:06.032
Okay, Mr. Deakins, could you
remove your coat, please?

21:06.065 --> 21:07.700
I'd rather not.

21:07.734 --> 21:10.470
In order to examine you,
I need to listen to your chest.

21:12.472 --> 21:14.341
It's all right, George.

21:22.915 --> 21:24.617
Whoa, they steal your clothes?

21:24.651 --> 21:26.919
Uh, yeah.

21:26.953 --> 21:28.655
Okay, get him a drape.

21:28.688 --> 21:31.724
Cocktail napkin
ought to do it.

21:31.758 --> 21:33.960
So, they scratched you up
pretty good.

21:33.993 --> 21:35.428
How many guys
were there?

21:35.462 --> 21:36.463
Must have been

21:36.496 --> 21:39.399
like four or five.

21:39.432 --> 21:41.668
With long nails...
and a tennis racket.

21:44.704 --> 21:47.974
So, George...

21:48.007 --> 21:50.710
You a sports fan?

21:50.743 --> 21:52.679
Fluid looks clear.
B.P.'s sky high,

21:52.712 --> 21:55.014
220/140.
Start an esmolol drip.

21:55.047 --> 21:56.048
Hypertension
part of the syndrome?

21:56.082 --> 21:57.684
Who pushed the
Demerol for you?

21:57.717 --> 21:59.085
They should've
verified.
Nobody. I did.

21:59.118 --> 22:00.119
There was no nurse?

22:00.152 --> 22:01.120
I was called
out of the room.

22:01.153 --> 22:02.789
It's not Abby's fault.

22:02.822 --> 22:04.391
I'm more than capable
of pushing pain meds.

22:04.424 --> 22:06.125
Shouldn't push anything
without medical history.

22:06.158 --> 22:07.560
Didn't want to wait for the
nursing home-- he's in pain.

22:07.594 --> 22:08.395
Who did you speak to,
by the way?

22:08.428 --> 22:09.929
The receptionist.

22:09.962 --> 22:11.698
Oh, so you didn't actually talk
to a doctor or a nurse.

22:11.731 --> 22:13.065
Dr. Carter...
I couldn't.
They were busy.

22:13.099 --> 22:14.767
No. What you can't do
is take no for an answer

22:14.801 --> 22:16.703
when you have an unstable
patient with an unknown history.

22:16.736 --> 22:18.438
I gave her the order.

22:18.471 --> 22:20.940
I thought you said morphine.

22:20.973 --> 22:22.609
Neela saw
it was contra-indicated,

22:22.642 --> 22:23.743
so I changed it to Demerol.

22:23.776 --> 22:24.644
Then what, you forgot?

22:24.677 --> 22:27.046
I was a bit preoccupied.

22:27.079 --> 22:28.715
Had someone crashing
in C.T.
Dr. Gallant...

22:28.748 --> 22:30.082
Myoclonus
and hyper-reflexia.

22:30.116 --> 22:31.751
Isn't there
a serotonin antagonist

22:31.784 --> 22:34.787
we can give him?
No. We just
have to wait.

22:34.821 --> 22:35.722
For what?

22:35.755 --> 22:37.757
To see if he lives.

22:39.659 --> 22:40.760
DEAKINS:
When can I go?

22:40.793 --> 22:42.695
You have to talk
to the police first.

22:42.729 --> 22:44.731
The police?

22:44.764 --> 22:46.933
About my mugging?

22:46.966 --> 22:48.935
Yeah.

22:55.207 --> 22:57.477
Still haven't left?

22:57.510 --> 22:58.778
I don't want to talk about it.

22:58.811 --> 23:00.112
I'm going to kill you.

23:00.146 --> 23:01.614
Baby, please,
I am sorry.

23:01.648 --> 23:03.450
Listen, please...

23:06.486 --> 23:08.087
How does a guy like that
get to be such a freak?

23:08.120 --> 23:09.589
Born with a Y
chromosome?

23:09.622 --> 23:10.923
Oh, so all men are twisted?

23:10.957 --> 23:12.925
LEWIS:
You said it.
You hate men.

23:12.959 --> 23:16.463
If it wasn't for
sperm and heavy lifting,
you'd all be useless.

23:16.496 --> 23:19.131
You know, I can't
wait to pop this baby
out so men'll quit

23:19.165 --> 23:21.501
looking at me either
like I'm Mother Teresa
or the cover of Maxim.

23:21.534 --> 23:23.903
It's not just men-- come on,
the world's full of degenerates.

23:23.936 --> 23:26.205
Yeah, and the sad part is
they always get away with it.

23:26.238 --> 23:29.476
( screaming )

23:33.245 --> 23:35.748
Temp's still up, 104.

23:35.782 --> 23:37.216
Another 200 of
I.V. dantrolene.

23:37.249 --> 23:38.918
How come there's
no written order
on this chart?

23:38.951 --> 23:41.020
We were busy--
I called it out on the run.

23:41.053 --> 23:43.490
Demerol, 50-milligram
I.V. push,

23:43.523 --> 23:45.157
verbal order, 10:23.

23:45.191 --> 23:47.727
Dr. Gallant, can I speak
with you for a moment?

23:47.760 --> 23:50.196
Sorry, you're right.
It's more like 10:45.

23:50.229 --> 23:51.531
Pulse ox down to 82.

23:51.564 --> 23:53.032
He's not moving any air.

23:53.065 --> 23:54.667
Too much ativan?

23:54.701 --> 23:55.968
Maybe, or neurologic
damage from the
hyperthermia.

23:56.002 --> 23:57.604
Okay, let's open
an intubation tray.

23:57.637 --> 23:59.706
Bag him on 100 percent,
andetomidate and sux.

23:59.739 --> 24:00.907
His wife and daughter are here.

24:00.940 --> 24:02.775
LOCKHART:
Suction's ready.

24:02.809 --> 24:04.143
CARTER:
Call Respiratory
for a vent.

24:04.176 --> 24:05.712
LOCKHART:
Sats are up to 89
with bagging.

24:05.745 --> 24:07.547
Take 'em to the family room.

24:07.580 --> 24:11.083
Neela, come on, come on,
you're doing the tube, let's go.

24:19.759 --> 24:21.928
TAGGART:
Welcome to the perv ward,
Mr. Deakins.

24:21.961 --> 24:23.530
You put me in a special room?

24:23.563 --> 24:24.997
Don't worry,
they're all special.

24:25.031 --> 24:27.734
Uh, pervert's a
relative term, honey.

24:27.767 --> 24:29.101
Call me honey again,
I'll come over there

24:29.135 --> 24:30.703
and give you the longest
catheter in the world.

24:30.737 --> 24:33.039
KOVAC:
Neosporin to the lac,

24:33.072 --> 24:35.274
B.I.D.

24:35.307 --> 24:37.777
So, I've got our
problem solved.

24:37.810 --> 24:39.846
Alex's birthday party.

24:39.879 --> 24:43.182
Aw, thanks for the
help, Luka, but I
think it's my problem.

24:43.215 --> 24:47.019
You see, that's
your first mistake.

24:47.053 --> 24:50.089
Anyway, a plan is in motion,
arrangements are being made,

24:50.122 --> 24:52.058
and everything
is under control.

24:52.091 --> 24:54.561
Keegan's C.B.C. isn't back yet,
and I need a head C.T. on Hong.

24:54.594 --> 24:56.963
Do me a favor, would you:
call United and check
on my departure time?

24:56.996 --> 24:59.031
What, are you flying
through Paris?
Amsterdam.

24:59.065 --> 25:01.067
Hello?

25:01.100 --> 25:02.569
Frank.

25:02.602 --> 25:05.071
Hey, Frank.
What's up? How are you?

25:05.104 --> 25:06.973
Just thought I'd
stop by on my way
out from rehab.

25:07.006 --> 25:09.008
How's that going?
How do you think?

25:09.041 --> 25:10.910
They split my chest
open like a baked
Montana trout.

25:10.943 --> 25:13.245
You don't just
bounce back, you know.

25:13.279 --> 25:15.948
Want to see my scar?
No, but there's a guy in two
who might want to touch it.

25:15.982 --> 25:17.850
You look good. You do.

25:17.884 --> 25:19.652
I can do two miles
on the treadmill.

25:19.686 --> 25:22.922
I haven't been able to do that
since... well, ever.

25:22.955 --> 25:25.091
Where the hell
are my last two paychecks?

25:25.124 --> 25:26.926
Ah, I've been
holding them for you.

25:26.959 --> 25:27.960
Where, in your wallet?

25:27.994 --> 25:29.095
When are you coming back?

25:29.128 --> 25:30.930
I don't know, you know?

25:30.963 --> 25:32.632
Rehab's like a spa vacation.

25:32.665 --> 25:34.601
My old police benefits
are a charm.

25:34.601 --> 25:37.103
I don't really miss
this sideshow.

25:37.136 --> 25:38.170
Is Dr. Pratt around?

25:38.204 --> 25:40.072
He's off today.

25:40.106 --> 25:41.808
Tell him I owe him a beer.

25:41.841 --> 25:43.109
Sure thing.

25:46.012 --> 25:47.747
Look...

25:47.780 --> 25:50.116
my doctor's not
ready for me to come
back to work yet.

25:50.149 --> 25:53.920
It's going to be
awhile, but... I
do miss everybody.

25:53.953 --> 25:55.755
Just wanted to say that.

25:55.788 --> 25:57.624
Four-year-old with left
upper quadrant pain.

25:57.624 --> 25:59.759
Found by father with shortness
of breath and confusion.

25:59.792 --> 26:02.261
He kept asking for me
even though I was... I
was standing right there.

26:02.294 --> 26:04.263
It was like he
couldn't see.

26:04.296 --> 26:05.732
Tachy at 144, resps 42.

26:05.765 --> 26:08.134
B.P. 86/55.
Hey, big guy,

26:08.167 --> 26:10.302
when did your tummy
start hurting?
No, Mommy, no.

26:10.336 --> 26:11.738
She's on her way, buddy.
He's not making any sense.

26:11.771 --> 26:12.972
Any medical problems?

26:13.005 --> 26:14.040
No, he's always
been healthy.

26:14.073 --> 26:15.708
77 systolic.

26:15.742 --> 26:17.043
How are you doing,
Tevin?

26:17.076 --> 26:18.878
I don't like horses.

26:18.911 --> 26:21.047
He's altered. Have a pedes
intubation tray ready

26:21.080 --> 26:22.649
and squeeze in
those fluids.

26:22.682 --> 26:23.282
Hey, do you know
what this is?

26:23.315 --> 26:24.751
Your son's spleen

26:24.784 --> 26:26.886
is enlarged-- it may be acting
like a sponge,

26:26.919 --> 26:29.121
soaking up his blood
so it can't circulate.

26:29.155 --> 26:30.657
So, what can you do to stop it?

26:30.690 --> 26:32.224
Hopefully, transfusions

26:32.258 --> 26:34.026
will keep him stable
until we know what's causing it.

26:34.060 --> 26:36.262
First liter in,
pulse in the 70s.

26:36.295 --> 26:38.364
Okay, keep the N.S. coming.

26:38.397 --> 26:39.766
Femoral line kit.
I'm with him every day.

26:39.799 --> 26:41.333
I-I-I-I take
care of him.

26:41.367 --> 26:43.670
Nothing like this
has ever happened.

26:43.670 --> 26:45.037
Does your son have
a history of Thallassemia
or sickle cell disease?

26:45.071 --> 26:46.906
My wife has the trait,
but I tested negative.

26:46.939 --> 26:48.741
I want to go
on the ferris wheel.

26:48.775 --> 26:50.409
Okay, as soon as
you're better, buddy.

26:50.442 --> 26:52.278
I-I-I don't know what
that other thing is.

26:52.311 --> 26:54.313
Thallassemia?
It's a hereditary anemia.

26:54.346 --> 26:55.948
Here you go.
Huh?

26:55.982 --> 26:56.849
Keep talking to him--
it's the best thing

26:56.883 --> 26:58.084
you can do right now.

26:58.117 --> 26:59.686
Blood's here.
Femoral line's in.

26:59.719 --> 27:00.920
Run them on the infuser.

27:00.953 --> 27:02.922
You think it's
occult trauma?

27:02.955 --> 27:04.691
Should we call
in Social Work?

27:04.724 --> 27:07.226
I don't know. It could be
malignancy, emoglobinopathies...

27:07.259 --> 27:08.728
That's some
differential.

27:08.761 --> 27:12.198
Yeah. Add a sickle screen
and HIV to the labs.

27:12.231 --> 27:14.901
We didn't realize Luis was
recently put on phenelzine.

27:14.934 --> 27:17.236
There's an interaction
between the drugs

27:17.269 --> 27:19.939
that creates a condition
known as serotonin syndrome.

27:19.972 --> 27:22.274
You get very sick.

27:22.308 --> 27:24.844
Like when they gave him
the morphine that time?

27:24.877 --> 27:27.246
Uh, worse.
You get high fever,

27:27.279 --> 27:29.749
high blood pressure,
rapid heart rate,

27:29.782 --> 27:31.083
muscle spasms.

27:31.117 --> 27:32.719
How long does
that last?

27:32.752 --> 27:34.253
A few days at least.

27:34.286 --> 27:36.122
But it's very serious.

27:36.155 --> 27:39.726
Up to 30 percent of people with
serotonin syndrome die from it.

27:39.759 --> 27:41.894
So 70 percent survive?

27:41.928 --> 27:43.863
Yes, ma'am.

27:46.265 --> 27:49.001
They didn't think he'd ever wake
up after the fall, but he did.

27:49.035 --> 27:52.371
Good. Good. That means
he's a fighter.

27:56.042 --> 27:57.977
He's really smart, you know?

27:58.010 --> 28:01.047
I mean, he was going
to go back to school
before the accident.

28:01.080 --> 28:03.449
Then I got pregnant again.

28:03.482 --> 28:06.786
My dad hired him
on at his roofing
business.

28:06.819 --> 28:08.988
They don't usually
work when it's icy,

28:09.021 --> 28:11.057
but there was a job

28:11.090 --> 28:14.060
that he wanted to
finish before Christmas.

28:16.162 --> 28:17.930
Why are you saying
you did this?

28:17.964 --> 28:19.131
It doesn't change anything,
and I'm partially to blame.

28:19.165 --> 28:20.466
And that makes
it okay to lie?

28:20.499 --> 28:22.234
Neela, do you want to match,
or don't you?

28:22.268 --> 28:23.335
Only if I deserve to.

28:23.369 --> 28:25.337
You do, so let this
be my fault.

28:25.371 --> 28:28.340
Hey, patellar
dislocation in curtain
four needs a reduction.

28:28.374 --> 28:29.475
How's Luis?

28:29.508 --> 28:32.444
He's, um... he's stable.

28:32.478 --> 28:36.448
It's looking
pretty good.

28:36.482 --> 28:38.250
Is there something that
I should know about?

28:38.284 --> 28:40.219
No.

28:40.252 --> 28:41.788
All right, well, you
did what you were told.

28:41.821 --> 28:43.455
Gallant's a
supervising resident.

28:43.489 --> 28:45.457
He should've known
better than to
order up a drug

28:45.491 --> 28:47.159
without verifying
a current medical
history.

28:47.193 --> 28:48.795
He didn't. I did.

28:50.496 --> 28:52.398
You ordered the Demerol?

28:52.431 --> 28:55.401
I assessed it. I ordered it.
I pushed it.

28:57.369 --> 29:00.339
And you didn't run
it by an attending
or a resident?

29:00.372 --> 29:01.808
No.

29:01.841 --> 29:02.975
And you did it
because I asked you

29:03.009 --> 29:04.043
to be more autonomous?

29:04.076 --> 29:05.477
We found an Arabic interpreter

29:05.511 --> 29:07.179
for your belly pain lady.

29:07.213 --> 29:08.815
Thank you. All right,

29:08.848 --> 29:10.817
we need to talk about
this-- the three of us.

29:11.851 --> 29:13.319
Everything okay?

29:13.352 --> 29:14.821
Fantastic.

29:14.821 --> 29:15.822
Oh, Lavecchia's results.

29:15.855 --> 29:17.489
Kidney stone
from this morning?

29:17.523 --> 29:20.292
No hydro, pain free with Toradol
and ready to go home.

29:20.326 --> 29:22.829
Just like you said. Didn't need
the Demerol after all.

29:22.862 --> 29:24.997
You still have the vial?
Put it back in drug lock-up.

29:25.031 --> 29:26.833
I used it for
another patient.

29:26.866 --> 29:28.835
KOVAC:
Sam, did you get labs back
on Tevin?

29:34.874 --> 29:36.142
How's Tevin doing?

29:36.175 --> 29:37.309
He's doing much
better, thanks.

29:37.343 --> 29:38.477
I want to go home.

29:38.510 --> 29:40.479
Mr. Walker...

29:40.512 --> 29:43.149
Hey, you want to pick out
a sticker?

29:46.886 --> 29:50.156
Tevin tested positive
for, uh, sickle cell anemia.

29:50.189 --> 29:53.325
That's impossible--
I told you, I don't
carry the gene.

29:53.359 --> 29:55.161
Maybe there was a mistake
with your test.

29:55.194 --> 29:57.129
Maybe there was a
mistake with your test.

29:57.163 --> 29:59.531
What your son has--
splenic sequestration--

29:59.565 --> 30:02.869
is consistent with sickle cell,
and I think he has a form

30:02.902 --> 30:04.236
that's very...
You're not listening.

30:04.270 --> 30:06.072
I told you, I went to
a genetic counselor.

30:06.105 --> 30:08.307
He said I'm not a carrier,
that our son could not get

30:08.340 --> 30:10.076
the disease
unless both parents are.

30:11.377 --> 30:13.079
That's true.

30:13.112 --> 30:16.082
So, what, you're saying
I'm not his father?

30:17.649 --> 30:19.618
What I'd like to do
is send his blood

30:19.651 --> 30:24.123
for a more advanced test...
just to be sure.

30:24.156 --> 30:27.626
Send my blood, too.

30:27.659 --> 30:30.162
Test me again.

30:35.101 --> 30:38.304
Neela... Carter
wants to talk to
me after my shift.

30:38.337 --> 30:39.972
I told him what happened.
You what?

30:40.006 --> 30:41.874
I didn't think it was right
for us to lie about it,

30:41.908 --> 30:43.609
so I thought it'd be better
to get it out now.

30:43.642 --> 30:45.611
Nobody needed to
know, Neela-- that
was kind of the point.

30:45.644 --> 30:49.548
Please, someone! Please help!
Something's wrong!

30:49.581 --> 30:51.483
He went into v-tach,

30:51.517 --> 30:53.152
unsuccessful cardioversion
at 200.

30:53.185 --> 30:54.486
Get him off the
vent and bag him.

30:54.520 --> 30:55.621
Please, he can't be dying.

30:55.654 --> 30:58.457
Charged to 300. Clear.

30:58.490 --> 31:00.126
No change. Try 360.

31:00.159 --> 31:01.293
Need any help?

31:01.327 --> 31:02.461
Amp of epi
after the next one.

31:02.494 --> 31:04.630
MARQUEZ:
Charged.
Clear.

31:04.663 --> 31:06.132
V fib, 100 of lidocaine.

31:06.165 --> 31:08.134
This is not supposed
to happen.

31:08.167 --> 31:09.601
Go find Dr. Carter now.

31:09.635 --> 31:11.437
Let's go, 360 again.

31:11.470 --> 31:13.439
Clear.

31:13.472 --> 31:15.607
Come on, hit him
again. 360.

31:15.641 --> 31:18.244
MARQUEZ:
Clear.

31:24.216 --> 31:25.584
GALLANT:
Still in fib.

31:25.617 --> 31:27.286
CARTER:
All right, 360
again. Clear.

31:29.121 --> 31:30.957
Asystole.

31:30.957 --> 31:32.391
How long has it been?

31:32.424 --> 31:33.960
Should we try the
high dose epi?

31:33.993 --> 31:35.027
42 minutes.

31:35.061 --> 31:36.395
Run the dopamine
wide open.

31:36.428 --> 31:38.330
We still have time.

31:38.364 --> 31:39.631
Or we can pace him.

31:39.665 --> 31:40.632
Neela...

31:40.666 --> 31:41.968
Let's try pacing him.

31:41.968 --> 31:42.969
WEAVER:
Tie off the lines,

31:43.002 --> 31:45.037
leave the E.T.
for the coroner.

31:45.071 --> 31:48.374
Carter, go inform the
family and then meet
us in the suture room.

32:02.288 --> 32:04.423
Are his tests back?

32:04.456 --> 32:07.259
They, uh, confirmed
my diagnosis...

32:07.293 --> 32:10.596
but the good thing is
most kids do very well

32:10.629 --> 32:13.032
with folate and
prophylactic antibiotics.

32:13.065 --> 32:15.601
Good. That's good.

32:15.634 --> 32:19.205
I, uh, also ran
your blood through.

32:19.238 --> 32:21.207
The tests indicate that...

32:21.240 --> 32:23.342
Is there anything
affecting my health

32:23.375 --> 32:25.011
that I need to know about?

32:26.045 --> 32:27.479
Not really, no.

32:27.513 --> 32:30.382
So all that piece of paper
is going to tell me

32:30.416 --> 32:32.351
is whether or not
he's got my genes.

32:32.384 --> 32:35.121
Either way,
he's still my son.

32:35.154 --> 32:37.289
I'm his father.

32:37.323 --> 32:40.392
From a medical standpoint,
it's a bit more complicated...

32:40.426 --> 32:44.396
Liza... my wife and I--

32:44.430 --> 32:47.566
we, um... we went
through a rough patch

32:47.599 --> 32:49.368
about five years ago.

32:49.401 --> 32:52.471
We broke up
for a few weeks.

32:52.504 --> 32:55.441
She got pregnant right after
we got back together.

32:55.474 --> 32:58.710
We've been happy ever since.

33:01.480 --> 33:06.085
She's going to want to know
about Tevin's condition.

33:06.118 --> 33:07.753
Mm.

33:07.786 --> 33:11.757
I'll tell her
that I'm a carrier.

33:11.790 --> 33:15.127
He got it from both of us...

33:15.161 --> 33:17.396
and he's going to be okay.

33:18.797 --> 33:20.566
He's in here,
Mrs. Walker.

33:20.599 --> 33:23.535
Honey, is he all right?
He's fine, he's fine.

33:31.643 --> 33:34.080
Did you get
his labs back?

33:34.113 --> 33:35.414
( sighs )

33:35.447 --> 33:36.748
Is he the father?

33:36.782 --> 33:38.717
Yeah.

33:40.786 --> 33:42.088
Hey, uh, I didn't
mean to keep ragging

33:42.088 --> 33:43.589
on your suggestions before.

33:43.622 --> 33:45.357
Maybe Mr. Jekyll's
isn't such a bad idea.

33:45.391 --> 33:47.359
Mr. Hyde's.

33:47.393 --> 33:49.561
Look, I... I know I'm
not exactly Carol Brady,

33:49.595 --> 33:51.830
so I just really wanted
it to be something special.

33:51.863 --> 33:53.199
It will be.

33:53.232 --> 33:55.167
Just be ready to go
in half an hour.

33:55.201 --> 33:57.103
I have to pick something up,
okay?

33:59.538 --> 34:01.173
Was the med list current?

34:01.207 --> 34:02.641
Kerry, I think
we should stick to protocol.

34:02.674 --> 34:04.510
As the Attending,
I'd like to have a chance

34:04.543 --> 34:06.512
to review the case
with my staff before we do this.

34:06.545 --> 34:08.246
Was the med list
current or not?

34:08.280 --> 34:10.815
It was recent.

34:10.849 --> 34:12.650
It wasn't completely up to date.

34:12.684 --> 34:14.620
And no one checked
with the nursing home?

34:14.652 --> 34:15.420
I tried.

34:15.454 --> 34:16.621
You tried?

34:16.655 --> 34:17.656
Abby, why didn't you
push the meds?

34:17.688 --> 34:19.425
I was called out of the room,

34:19.458 --> 34:21.360
but the result wouldn't have
been any different.

34:21.393 --> 34:22.527
As the nurse, it's
your responsibility

34:22.561 --> 34:23.728
to double-check

34:23.762 --> 34:25.231
allergies and interactions.

34:25.264 --> 34:26.465
I thought
that had been done,

34:26.498 --> 34:28.266
to the best
of anybody's ability.

34:28.300 --> 34:29.501
This is a case of trying
to manage a patient's pan

34:29.534 --> 34:31.437
with incomplete
information.

34:31.469 --> 34:33.205
I suspect a jury
isn't going to see it that way.

34:33.239 --> 34:35.474
Who made the decision?

34:35.507 --> 34:36.574
I did.

34:36.608 --> 34:38.810
You did?

34:38.844 --> 34:40.679
So now we let medical students
push pain meds

34:40.712 --> 34:41.780
without any supervision?

34:41.813 --> 34:43.282
No, that's not what happened.

34:43.315 --> 34:44.583
CARTER:
I was with
a critical care patient.

34:44.616 --> 34:46.485
Neela did exactly
what I told her to.

34:46.518 --> 34:48.487
Actually, that's not...
She's just trying
to protect me.

34:48.520 --> 34:50.156
Do you all need a few
minutes to get your
stories straight?

34:54.493 --> 34:57.363
What does it say on the chart?

34:57.396 --> 34:58.764
Exactly what I've been saying.

34:58.797 --> 35:01.200
I ordered up the drug
and Neela pushed it.

35:01.233 --> 35:03.469
And is that accurate?

35:07.206 --> 35:09.675
Like I said,
I wasn't in the room.

35:09.708 --> 35:12.244
Simple question--
Is it accurate?

35:12.278 --> 35:14.346
As far as I know, yes.

35:18.750 --> 35:20.352
A young man comes in here

35:20.386 --> 35:22.254
and dies
of a lethal drug reaction

35:22.288 --> 35:24.456
that could have
been prevented

35:24.490 --> 35:26.592
with one phone call.

35:28.660 --> 35:30.762
Next time, why don't we
just send a blank check

35:30.796 --> 35:33.865
to the family's attorney?

35:37.403 --> 35:38.437
SAM:
Mom.

35:38.470 --> 35:39.438
Mom.

35:39.471 --> 35:41.273
Son of Sam is back.

35:41.307 --> 35:42.441
What are you doing here?

35:42.474 --> 35:43.809
Luka picked me up.
It's amazing.

35:43.842 --> 35:45.311
We gotta go, though.
We gotta go.

35:45.344 --> 35:46.778
Hold on.
MARQUEZ:
I'll take those, Sam.

35:46.812 --> 35:48.780
Come on. If we hurry now,
we can get there by 11:00.

35:48.814 --> 35:50.516
What are you
talking about?
Let's go, let's go.

35:50.549 --> 35:51.683
And what are you wearing?

35:51.717 --> 35:52.884
Luka said
I have to wear a life vest

35:52.918 --> 35:54.286
if I want to get
on the boat.

35:54.320 --> 35:55.487
SAM:
Boat?

35:55.521 --> 35:57.323
Isn't it awesome?

35:57.356 --> 36:00.792
It's, like, bigger
than our whole apartment.

36:00.826 --> 36:04.796
Wow, you really went
a whole other direction.

36:04.830 --> 36:07.433
A weekend in the
great outdoors,

36:07.466 --> 36:08.967
fishing, camping,
burning s'mores.

36:09.000 --> 36:10.336
S'mores?

36:10.369 --> 36:11.670
Do you even know
what that is?

36:11.703 --> 36:12.971
Yeah, that white
thing on a stick.

36:13.004 --> 36:14.640
Come on, you got
to see inside.

36:14.673 --> 36:15.874
Wait, where are we going?

36:15.907 --> 36:18.544
I rented a spot
at Lake Geneva.

36:18.577 --> 36:21.247
Bottom of the ninth,
two outs, nobody on

36:21.280 --> 36:24.250
and here comes Kovac
with the clutch homer.

36:24.283 --> 36:25.551
Is that baseball?

36:25.584 --> 36:26.718
Mm-hmm.

36:27.919 --> 36:29.555
( horn honking )

36:29.588 --> 36:33.259
How are you going
to back this thing out?

36:38.530 --> 36:40.766
Mr. Joss' triple-A
repair went well.

36:40.799 --> 36:42.468
He's stable in the ICU,

36:42.501 --> 36:45.271
and Dr. Edson's
finishing up

36:45.304 --> 36:47.573
on the perirectal abscess
right now.

36:47.606 --> 36:49.375
Uh, and do you know
a cheap red wine

36:49.408 --> 36:50.576
that goes with spicy food?

36:50.609 --> 36:51.743
I have a date.

36:51.777 --> 36:53.745
Two nights in a row?

36:53.779 --> 36:55.781
It's with
the teacher tonight.

36:55.814 --> 36:57.649
Okay.

36:57.683 --> 36:59.785
Zinfandel.

37:01.820 --> 37:04.956
I'm not completely comfortable
with waking up with one man

37:04.990 --> 37:07.893
and going out with another
the next night.

37:07.926 --> 37:09.661
Well, if we were guys,

37:09.695 --> 37:12.764
we'd be talking about
carburetors right now.

37:12.798 --> 37:16.902
So, you don't think
it's... slutty?

37:16.935 --> 37:19.305
No.

37:19.305 --> 37:21.907
I just won't sleep with him.

37:21.940 --> 37:25.311
That sounds
like a good plan.

37:25.311 --> 37:26.912
Good-night.
Good-night.

37:26.945 --> 37:29.915
Women plan, God laughs.

37:29.948 --> 37:32.918
Hey, when did I become
the guru of sluttiness?

37:32.951 --> 37:35.887
Did you start
the banana bag on Vern?
Three times.

37:35.921 --> 37:39.525
He keeps going off
to the bathroom and
coming back drunk.

37:39.558 --> 37:41.393
I think I should delete
emergency medicine

37:41.427 --> 37:43.562
from my match list.

37:43.595 --> 37:45.531
It was one mistake, and
I pushed you too hard.

37:45.564 --> 37:47.466
No.
What they said about me

37:47.499 --> 37:49.701
in your meeting
was all true.

37:49.735 --> 37:51.537
Look, you're a talented doctor,

37:51.570 --> 37:53.672
and you did a lot of good
things on the shift today.

37:53.705 --> 37:56.342
Nothing I did on this shift
can convince me,

37:56.375 --> 37:58.510
or anyone else,
that I belong here.

37:58.544 --> 38:01.680
Well, yesterday, you were
a little too cautious.

38:01.713 --> 38:03.915
Today, you were a
little too reckless.

38:03.949 --> 38:05.517
Somewhere in the middle

38:05.551 --> 38:08.387
is the way to practice
emergency medicine.

38:28.507 --> 38:30.041
I just want you to know

38:30.075 --> 38:32.911
I shouldn't have left you
alone with the patient

38:32.944 --> 38:34.380
until he was stable.

38:34.380 --> 38:36.982
It's my fault.

38:37.015 --> 38:39.885
What you did was the sweetest,
dumbest thing

38:39.918 --> 38:42.954
anyone has ever done
for me.

38:42.988 --> 38:44.456
Well, something like this

38:44.490 --> 38:48.560
could've derailed
your career.

38:48.594 --> 38:51.963
The worst that'll
happen to me is...

38:51.997 --> 38:54.666
discipline, counseling.

38:54.700 --> 38:57.002
I'll be all right.

38:57.035 --> 39:01.707
You don't look all right.

39:03.709 --> 39:05.143
Seems kind of silly now,

39:05.176 --> 39:07.979
but out in the bay this
morning, I was, uh...

39:11.983 --> 39:16.121
...was thinking
about asking you out.

39:16.154 --> 39:19.791
I was thinking of saying yes.

39:25.631 --> 39:27.966
Neela, I have the cefoxitin
for Mr. Martin.

39:27.999 --> 39:29.635
I just need
the extension tubing.

39:29.668 --> 39:31.169
( sniffles )

39:31.202 --> 39:33.605
Are you okay?

39:33.639 --> 39:35.541
I'm fine. I'll take care of it.

39:35.574 --> 39:37.142
Let me help you find it.

39:37.175 --> 39:38.844
I said I can do it!

39:41.447 --> 39:43.081
Bottom drawer.

39:47.118 --> 39:51.523
( crying )

40:07.138 --> 40:10.442
Well, uh...
( clears throat )

40:10.476 --> 40:13.445
I suppose it's time
to call it a night.

40:13.479 --> 40:15.080
You're welcome to
stay a little while.

40:15.113 --> 40:16.615
No, no, no.

40:16.648 --> 40:20.452
I really should get going.

40:21.487 --> 40:23.455
I'll get my coat.

40:23.489 --> 40:25.857
I'll help you find it.

40:27.926 --> 40:30.128
It was such a lovely evening,
and, uh,

40:30.161 --> 40:32.898
I'm so glad that the
girls like each other.

40:32.931 --> 40:34.232
Ella's a great kid.

40:34.265 --> 40:35.901
Oh, and it was
really good of you

40:35.934 --> 40:37.235
to pick her up
from school.

40:37.268 --> 40:39.905
Thank you so much.

40:39.938 --> 40:42.240
Uh, you want me to
carry her to the car for you?

40:42.273 --> 40:45.076
No, no. No, I'm fine.

40:45.110 --> 40:46.077
I can manage.

40:46.111 --> 40:49.247
So...

40:49.280 --> 40:51.917
good night.

41:00.859 --> 41:04.095
CARTER:
You should've come
and talked to me.

41:12.103 --> 41:14.840
You know why
I backed you up in there?

41:14.873 --> 41:17.042
'Cause if Weaver
knew the truth...

41:17.075 --> 41:20.846
you'd be done.

41:20.879 --> 41:22.914
( clears throat )

41:22.948 --> 41:25.250
I know you went out
on a limb for me, but...

41:25.283 --> 41:27.553
I could just say
I got confused.

41:27.553 --> 41:29.621
Yeah, you could've...

41:29.655 --> 41:32.257
until you falsified the chart.

41:32.290 --> 41:33.859
But...

41:33.892 --> 41:35.594
That's a felony.

41:42.333 --> 41:44.302
Okay... ( clears throat )

41:44.335 --> 41:46.071
Well, then
I got to go tear it up.

41:46.104 --> 41:47.639
It's too late.
Why? Why? Why?

41:47.673 --> 41:48.874
It's just... it's just one entry

41:48.907 --> 41:50.676
on an otherwise
blank order sheet.

41:50.709 --> 41:52.844
Okay, nobody's going to
even know it's missing.

41:52.878 --> 41:54.145
We can go talk to Weaver again.

41:54.179 --> 41:56.582
It's too late!

41:56.615 --> 41:58.584
It's already up in Legal.

42:08.126 --> 42:10.629
You know, you guys...
you guys sit up there

42:10.662 --> 42:14.165
and you decide who's going to
go and who's going to stay.

42:14.199 --> 42:16.602
I mean,
why did you have to push her?

42:16.635 --> 42:18.269
Hmm? Why'd you have to push her?

42:18.303 --> 42:19.805
The only reason
she screwed up

42:19.838 --> 42:21.773
is because you scared
her into thinking

42:21.807 --> 42:22.808
she wasn't good enough!

42:22.841 --> 42:25.777
She wasn't cutting it!

42:27.846 --> 42:31.049
( quietly ):
We're talking
about you now, Michael.

42:43.962 --> 42:47.933
I wasn't thinking...

42:56.241 --> 42:58.810
I'm sorry.

43:01.079 --> 43:02.648
Yeah.

43:05.350 --> 43:07.753
Me, too.
