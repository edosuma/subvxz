WEBVTT

00:01.877 --> 00:03.504
TakeOver! Wall Street!

00:03.592 --> 00:06.670
TakeOver! Wall Street!
TakeOver! Wall Street!

00:06.716 --> 00:09.776
Make sure you get the crowd
in the background, Mark.

00:09.917 --> 00:11.713
Another shot of you
and the chanting masses.

00:11.720 --> 00:12.762
I'm so over this protest.

00:12.763 --> 00:17.013
Next time we'll do a piece on
Brazilian Runway Models, I promise.

00:17.013 --> 00:18.076
Gonna hold you to that.

00:18.077 --> 00:19.689
All right.
Let's roll this puppy.

00:19.689 --> 00:20.789
TakeOver! Wall Street!
TakeOver! Wall Street!

00:20.835 --> 00:21.855
Roger that.

00:21.855 --> 00:22.873
TakeOver! Wall Street!

00:22.874 --> 00:24.544
Hey, Ringo!
You're messing up sound.

00:24.545 --> 00:25.846
How about you take it
somewhere else?

00:25.922 --> 00:27.859
TakeOver! Wall Street!

00:27.859 --> 00:28.896
TakeOver! Wall Street!

00:28.897 --> 00:30.858
Okay, live in three...

00:30.859 --> 00:32.920
Wall Street!
TakeOver! Wall Street!

00:32.921 --> 00:34.017
TakeOver! Wall Street!

00:34.288 --> 00:39.376
I'm here at Boylan Plaza on day
36 of the TakeOver! protest.

00:39.441 --> 00:41.536
Hundreds have gathered here
and in other cities

00:41.537 --> 00:43.474
across the country

00:43.474 --> 00:45.453
to take a stand
against what they say

00:45.454 --> 00:47.453
is greed and corruption.

00:51.470 --> 00:52.491
Oh, my God.

00:54.445 --> 00:56.423
If you just tuned in,

00:56.424 --> 00:58.423
there's been
some kind of explosion

00:58.424 --> 01:01.432
on the southeast side
of the Boylan Plaza.

01:01.433 --> 01:04.465
We do not know what caused this
or if there are injuries,

01:04.465 --> 01:06.495
but I can see
what appear to be people

01:06.495 --> 01:09.453
on the ground, not moving.

01:11.000 --> 01:17.074

01:18.449 --> 01:21.398
This is unbelievable.

01:21.399 --> 01:23.498
Any idea how many people
were killed?

01:23.499 --> 01:26.415
Initial reports say five dead,

01:26.416 --> 01:28.444
- 28 injured.
- There's feds everywhere.

01:28.445 --> 01:30.391
Yeah, well,
that's normal procedure

01:30.392 --> 01:32.390
in the event of a bomb.

01:32.391 --> 01:35.091
There's nothing normal
about this.

01:35.123 --> 01:37.059
Detective, do the police know
who's behind this?

01:37.152 --> 01:38.437
Do they think this was
a terrorist attack?

01:38.480 --> 01:41.508
No comment. You'll have to
deal with press relations.

01:48.466 --> 01:50.398
Excuse me.

01:50.399 --> 01:52.423
- Oh, sorry.
- NYPD.

01:52.424 --> 01:54.394
NYPD's over there.

01:54.395 --> 01:55.437
Thanks.

01:55.437 --> 01:57.437
FBI has taken jurisdiction
of the crime scene.

01:58.479 --> 02:00.391
Thanks.

02:00.391 --> 02:01.474
Come on, Castle.

02:08.416 --> 02:10.433
FBI turned
you guys away, too, huh?

02:10.433 --> 02:12.202
Yeah, they wouldn't let us
past the crime scene tape.

02:12.247 --> 02:13.267
What's going on?

02:13.290 --> 02:15.339
Gates is talking to the feds,
trying to get a handle on that.

02:15.340 --> 02:17.298
What do we know about
the explosion,

02:17.299 --> 02:18.372
who set it off?

02:18.373 --> 02:19.698
Well, it probably
wasn't a suicide bomber.

02:19.772 --> 02:21.423
I got a friend who's a medic,
said that there were

02:21.426 --> 02:23.369
no explosive vests
on any of the bodies.

02:23.415 --> 02:26.314
Everything else
is just rumor at this point.

02:26.345 --> 02:28.282
Listen up, people.

02:28.283 --> 02:30.340
We'll still piecing together
what happened here.

02:30.341 --> 02:33.311
But what I can tell you...
FBI and Homeland Security

02:33.312 --> 02:35.332
will be taking point
on this investigation.

02:35.333 --> 02:39.283
NYPD will act
in a support capacity.

02:39.283 --> 02:40.381
Our first assignment
is to determine

02:41.403 --> 02:44.109
if any of the victims were targeted because
of their involvement in the protest.

02:44.386 --> 02:46.930
Uniforms are bringing families
to the precinct as we speak,

02:46.946 --> 02:50.792
so... let's go hold some hands
and do our jobs.

02:52.358 --> 02:55.358
Mr. Levine, I understand
that one of the victims,

02:55.359 --> 02:58.378
Jesse Friedman,
worked closely with you.

02:58.833 --> 03:00.748
It was more than that.

03:00.749 --> 03:02.815
He was a friend,
a comrade in arms, you know?

03:02.816 --> 03:04.837
Jesse was a recruiter.

03:04.837 --> 03:06.793
When attendance dropped
a few weeks back,

03:06.794 --> 03:08.756
even I thought it was
time to pack up,

03:08.757 --> 03:10.745
but Jesse just threw
my favorite quote back at me.

03:10.746 --> 03:12.777
The one about
sinning by silence.

03:12.778 --> 03:15.765
"To sin by silence
when we should protest

03:15.766 --> 03:19.740
makes... cowards of men."

03:19.741 --> 03:21.715
We know that this is difficult,

03:21.716 --> 03:23.715
but what was
your husband's involvement

03:23.716 --> 03:25.773
with the TakeOver! movement?

03:25.774 --> 03:28.819
Matt wasn't involved.
Neither am I.

03:28.820 --> 03:32.754
<i>So why were you
at Boylan Plaza?</i>

03:32.754 --> 03:33.826
<i>It's our first time here.</i>

03:33.827 --> 03:35.820
<i>We wanted to take in
as much as we could.</i>

03:37.418 --> 03:38.439
You're tourists?

03:38.440 --> 03:40.376
<i>We'd just been to the top</i>

03:40.376 --> 03:41.472
<i>of the empire state building.</i>

03:41.473 --> 03:44.372
<i>We had an extra few minutes,
so we decided</i>

03:44.372 --> 03:46.426
to see what the protest
was all about.

03:49.385 --> 03:52.375
Matt and I just bought a house.

03:52.376 --> 03:56.405
<i>We were
going to start a family.</i>

03:56.406 --> 03:59.376
<i>We had all these plans.</i>

03:59.376 --> 04:01.476
What am I gonna do now?

04:10.389 --> 04:12.184
You okay?

04:12.228 --> 04:13.290
Yeah, yeah.

04:14.032 --> 04:15.130
It's just this case, you know?

04:15.199 --> 04:16.212
It kind of gets to you.

04:16.244 --> 04:18.277
How'd it go with the rest
of the families?

04:18.278 --> 04:22.231
Um, one victim
was the first kid

04:22.232 --> 04:24.306
in his family to go to college,

04:24.307 --> 04:27.302
and the other
was a mother of two, so...

04:27.303 --> 04:30.285
About like you'd expect.

04:30.286 --> 04:33.231
No one seems to have been
targeted, though.

04:33.232 --> 04:35.256
So their deaths were random.

04:35.257 --> 04:38.310
You know,
most of our victims, they...

04:38.311 --> 04:40.161
They die for a reason.

04:40.220 --> 04:41.661
You know,
there's a logic behind it.

04:41.987 --> 04:44.265
It's a twisted logic at times,

04:44.363 --> 04:47.506
but... at least
it makes some kind of sense.

04:47.542 --> 04:48.607
Yeah, but in this case,

04:48.608 --> 04:49.945
these people were just
in the wrong place

04:50.002 --> 04:51.065
at the wrong time.

04:51.066 --> 04:53.078
And their future
and all their plans,

04:53.078 --> 04:55.994
everything is just gone
in a flash.

05:00.007 --> 05:02.748
It makes you think about all
those things in your own life

05:02.805 --> 05:04.664
that you don't want
to put off anymore.

05:09.015 --> 05:11.086
Yo.

05:11.086 --> 05:14.094
Captain's gathering the troops.

05:16.829 --> 05:18.790
Now that it appears

05:18.791 --> 05:20.740
that this attack
was not directed

05:20.741 --> 05:22.782
at any specific individual,

05:22.783 --> 05:24.796
we've got a new assignment
from the FBI.

05:24.796 --> 05:26.775
We all know
where the bomb went off.

05:28.246 --> 05:30.278
It was here, right next to
this lamppost.

05:30.279 --> 05:33.207
The FBI just recovered
this photo

05:33.208 --> 05:35.315
from a protester's cell phone.

05:35.316 --> 05:37.241
It's of the same location,

05:37.241 --> 05:38.291
taken 47 seconds...

05:40.325 --> 05:42.311
before the explosion.

05:42.312 --> 05:44.282
That could only mean one thing.

05:44.283 --> 05:47.219
The bomb was placed here
by someone

05:47.220 --> 05:49.228
within
our 47-second time period.

05:49.229 --> 05:51.311
Our task is to interview

05:51.312 --> 05:55.257
all witnesses who were present
at Boylan Plaza.

05:55.258 --> 05:57.303
We are looking for anyone
who saw what went on

05:57.304 --> 05:59.315
by this lamppost
before the blast.

05:59.316 --> 06:02.283
Sir, there are over 300 names
on this list.

06:02.283 --> 06:04.252
How do you recommend
that we proceed?

06:04.253 --> 06:05.296
We bring in more shifts.

06:05.297 --> 06:07.319
Someone on that list

06:07.320 --> 06:11.258
saw the bomb being planted
within our 47-second window.

06:11.258 --> 06:15.241
We find that person,
we find the bomber.

06:20.448 --> 06:26.446
<font color="#3399CC">Subtitles by MemoryOnSmells

06:29.851 --> 06:31.876
Thank you for your time.

06:34.279 --> 06:36.224
Well, that was unhelpful.

06:36.233 --> 06:38.294
Yeah. I'm starting to sense
a pattern.

06:38.295 --> 06:40.298
You know, this next woman says

06:40.299 --> 06:43.258
that she was in the middle
of the whole thing.

06:43.815 --> 06:44.840
We were right here.

06:44.841 --> 06:46.860
It's like the bomb went off
right next to us.

06:47.011 --> 06:48.231
Who's we?

06:48.285 --> 06:49.304
Me and my sister Nadia.

06:49.305 --> 06:50.339
She's out there
right now waiting.

06:50.340 --> 06:52.302
Should I go get her?

06:52.302 --> 06:54.279
Uh, no, actually, it's better
if we just talk one-on-one.

06:54.280 --> 06:56.302
Now were the two of you
participating in the protests?

06:56.303 --> 06:58.326
Do I look like I'm in the 99%?

06:58.327 --> 07:01.302
No. We'd just left this
bridal boutique near the Plaza.

07:01.302 --> 07:02.360
Nadia's getting married
in June.

07:02.361 --> 07:05.305
And did you notice anyone
standing near the light post?

07:05.306 --> 07:07.289
I don't think so.

07:07.528 --> 07:09.089
Okay, well, I'm gonna need you
to tell us

07:09.172 --> 07:11.269
everything that you remember
from just before the bombing,

07:11.318 --> 07:12.570
starting with where you were.

07:12.570 --> 07:14.106
We were at the coffee truck,

07:14.191 --> 07:15.895
just trying to figure out
our next move.

07:16.308 --> 07:18.010
I'm a little shopped out,
Nadia.

07:18.138 --> 07:19.976
I mean, you tried on
11 dresses.

07:20.246 --> 07:21.907
They made me look like
a stay puft marshmallow.

07:21.993 --> 07:22.815
We have to keep looking.

07:22.900 --> 07:24.629
Can we look from home online?

07:24.709 --> 07:26.688
I'm not buying my wedding dress
on the Internet.

07:26.689 --> 07:28.729
It's just to give us ideas.
We need to regroup.

07:28.730 --> 07:31.700
You are this close
to bridezilla territory.

07:31.701 --> 07:34.567
Oh, maybe I'll wear jeans
to my wedding.

07:34.575 --> 07:36.296
Maybe we can hire that guy
as the band.

07:36.612 --> 07:38.356
That's mine!
Give that back!

07:38.437 --> 07:40.160
Could you imagine the look
on mom's...

07:40.581 --> 07:41.545
Damn it!

07:41.610 --> 07:43.905
Watch where you're going.
This is my...

07:43.937 --> 07:46.366
The force of it
knocked us on our asses.

07:46.429 --> 07:47.579
Nadia almost got trampled.

07:47.641 --> 07:48.676
Wait. Can you go back
to the...

07:48.740 --> 07:50.674
the middle eastern man
carrying the box.

07:50.675 --> 07:53.724
You said that he was
sweaty and nervous?

07:53.724 --> 07:55.377
And was he headed
toward the lamppost?

07:55.429 --> 07:56.463
Yeah.

07:56.745 --> 07:58.762
Do you remember his face well
enough to help us with a sketch?

07:58.763 --> 08:01.707
West Side Wally,

08:01.708 --> 08:03.474
back by popular demand.

08:03.481 --> 08:05.531
Come on, Kojak.
You know I prefer west side.

08:07.490 --> 08:08.548
West side then.

08:08.549 --> 08:12.477
Uh, did you ever see that man
at the Plaza?

08:12.477 --> 08:14.481
No. Guy's not familiar.

08:14.545 --> 08:16.521
Then again, lots of people,
lots of faces.

08:16.522 --> 08:18.529
Plus, I was over here.
That's my usual spot.

08:18.530 --> 08:20.634
Not by the coffee truck.
I don't care for the smell.

08:20.674 --> 08:23.351
Well, that puts you 50 feet away
from where the bomb went off.

08:23.533 --> 08:25.223
Did you have a clear view
of this lamppost?

08:25.263 --> 08:26.281
Not really, man.

08:26.282 --> 08:28.285
And you know I always try
to help Johnny Law.

08:28.285 --> 08:30.275
Did you notice anything
out of the ordinary

08:30.276 --> 08:32.240
in the minute
before the explosion?

08:32.241 --> 08:34.202
Anyone suspicious?

08:34.202 --> 08:35.264
TakeOver! Wall Street!

08:35.265 --> 08:38.222
TakeOver! Wall Street!
TakeOver! Wall Street!

08:38.222 --> 08:40.214
As a matter of fact, I did.

08:42.289 --> 08:46.248
TakeOver! Wall Street!
TakeOver! Wall Street!

08:46.248 --> 08:47.260
TakeOver! Wall Street!

08:51.210 --> 08:53.280
TakeOver! Wall Street!
TakeOver! Wall Street!

08:53.281 --> 08:56.213
We're good to go.

08:56.214 --> 08:58.255
TakeOver! Wall Street!
TakeOver! Wall Street!

08:58.256 --> 09:00.202
TakeOver! Wall Street!

09:00.202 --> 09:02.256
TakeOver! Wall Street!
TakeOver! Wall Street!

09:04.269 --> 09:06.240
Stop.

09:06.240 --> 09:07.277
Let me understand this.
You...

09:07.430 --> 09:08.465
You saw Beethoven,

09:08.524 --> 09:10.549
the composer who's been dead
for 200 years,

09:10.550 --> 09:12.523
- in the Plaza this afternoon?
- Oh, yeah.

09:12.524 --> 09:16.544
And I bet that half-deaf
bastard is behind all this.

09:16.545 --> 09:20.544
West Side, are you on any
medications of any kind?

09:20.545 --> 09:22.558
I don't see
how that's relevant.

09:23.228 --> 09:24.638
What do you mean,
we have no leads?

09:24.674 --> 09:25.734
What about
the middle eastern man?

09:25.794 --> 09:27.793
We interviewed him.
He cleared.

09:27.793 --> 09:30.954
Yeah, that box he was carrying...
full of Chinese takeout.

09:30.979 --> 09:32.478
Most dangerous thing in there
was M.S.G.

09:32.502 --> 09:35.496
Look, the fact is, is that
we interviewed 94 people,

09:35.497 --> 09:37.505
and we've got nothing
to show for it.

09:37.505 --> 09:39.497
Uh, this is not the news
I was hoping for,

09:39.498 --> 09:42.483
especially since the FBI
sent this over.

09:42.484 --> 09:44.496
It was e-mailed to two other
TakeOver! locations

09:44.497 --> 09:46.097
in New York an hour ago.

09:46.161 --> 09:47.709
"You were warned to stop
the protests.

09:47.714 --> 09:48.767
"You didn't listen.

09:48.768 --> 09:50.736
"Start listening now
or today's bombing

09:50.737 --> 09:52.768
will be just the beginning."

09:52.769 --> 09:54.256
He's gonna hit another protest.

09:54.343 --> 09:56.384
The FBI is keeping
this one under wraps,

09:56.540 --> 09:58.652
but the clock
is still ticking here.

09:58.670 --> 10:00.947
And what you're telling me is that
we're no closer to getting this guy

10:01.882 --> 10:03.310
than we were
when the bomb went off?

10:03.312 --> 10:06.273
Sir, somebody on this list
saw exactly what happened

10:06.740 --> 10:08.374
within that 47-second window,

10:08.514 --> 10:09.927
but the problem is,
is that they're mixed in

10:12.395 --> 10:15.397
It's like trying to find Waldo
in a sea of waldos.

10:15.398 --> 10:19.397
I take it you have
a proposal to fix that.

10:19.939 --> 10:22.938
If the FBI would let us
view all video

10:22.939 --> 10:23.881
shot in the Plaza,

10:23.915 --> 10:26.540
then maybe we can figure out
who was closest to the bomb,

10:26.907 --> 10:28.921
start prioritizing
the interviews.

10:28.922 --> 10:31.706
Okay, I'll go down there,
do my best.

10:31.804 --> 10:34.586
And if that doesn't work,
we'll look to plan "B."

10:34.586 --> 10:38.569
In the meantime,
keep working on the list.

10:39.774 --> 10:42.447
She doesn't seem very optimistic
about getting that footage.

10:42.460 --> 10:45.905
You know, the witnesses
that were closest to the bomb

10:45.993 --> 10:47.043
aren't on our list.

10:48.984 --> 10:51.983
Maybe dead men do tell tales.

10:52.685 --> 10:54.705
I just saw a reporter
in reception.

10:54.706 --> 10:56.693
Have security
get him outta here.

10:56.694 --> 10:59.517
I don't want him bothering
the victims' families.

10:59.518 --> 11:01.484
Oh! So nice to see
a friendly face.

11:01.502 --> 11:03.837
FBI has been up in mine
all night.

11:03.894 --> 11:05.857
All from the explosion?

11:06.111 --> 11:07.146
They never had a chance.

11:07.147 --> 11:09.136
If you're looking for
official cause of death,

11:09.137 --> 11:10.819
it's multiple
blunt force trauma.

11:10.889 --> 11:12.787
Actually, we were wondering if
there's anything on the bodies

11:12.837 --> 11:14.507
that might lead us
to whoever did this.

11:14.681 --> 11:15.700
Possibly.

11:15.701 --> 11:17.687
Meet Jesse Friedman.

11:17.688 --> 11:19.321
He was the recruiter
for the TakeOver! movement.

11:19.353 --> 11:21.447
He was also the guy
closest to the blast.

11:21.697 --> 11:24.612
And we found bits of this
embedded all over his skin.

11:24.635 --> 11:26.642
- Blue fabric?
- The lab I.D.'ed it as canvas.

11:26.643 --> 11:30.268
They also found high concentrations
of explosive residue on it.

11:30.354 --> 11:32.521
The canvas was part of
whatever contained the bomb.

11:32.557 --> 11:33.580
Looks that way.

11:33.581 --> 11:35.996
- So a duffel or a suitcase.
- This is a huge break.

11:36.060 --> 11:38.000
That means we're looking for
someone carrying a blue bag.

11:38.079 --> 11:39.844
Let's go update captain gates.

11:39.866 --> 11:41.100
Uh, can you just
give me a minute?

11:43.090 --> 11:45.082
Yeah, sure.

11:51.028 --> 11:54.035
Hey, honey.
How you doing?

11:54.036 --> 11:56.068
Yeah, I just needed a minute.

11:56.069 --> 11:57.919
You look exhausted.

11:57.956 --> 11:59.027
How long you been here?

11:59.028 --> 12:01.036
I'm not sure.
It's been so crazy.

12:02.650 --> 12:04.679
I've been cataloging
the victims' personal effects.

12:04.680 --> 12:06.703
Well, that can't be easy.

12:06.704 --> 12:08.703
I was fine.

12:08.704 --> 12:11.633
Then I saw how one of them
had on this bracelet...

12:11.633 --> 12:13.608
a string with beads
made by a little kid...

12:13.609 --> 12:15.611
and it... it was like
that bracelet I made you

12:15.612 --> 12:17.665
for father's day when I was 6.

12:17.666 --> 12:19.620
Do you remember?

12:19.620 --> 12:21.658
Remember?
I still have it.

12:23.654 --> 12:25.678
Come on.
Let's get you home.

12:26.533 --> 12:28.544
No, I should stay.
There's still work to do.

12:28.545 --> 12:29.708
And it'll be here tomorrow.

12:29.787 --> 12:31.520
Dr. Parish said I had to get
all this finished before she...

12:31.610 --> 12:32.993
Lanie will tell you
the same thing.

12:36.209 --> 12:39.209
Come on
let's get you outta here.

12:47.760 --> 12:48.791
TakeOver! Wall Street.

12:48.792 --> 12:49.817
- All right. Let's roll this puppy.
- Roger that.

12:49.818 --> 12:51.781
<i>That was
our very own Leann West,</i>

12:51.782 --> 12:54.802
<i>about to report live
from Boylan Plaza yesterday.</i>

12:54.802 --> 12:56.783
<i>Moments later, tragedy struck.</i>

12:56.784 --> 12:58.797
<i>Be aware, some of the images
we're about to show you</i>

12:58.798 --> 13:01.540
<i>may be disturbing
to some viewers.</i>

13:01.602 --> 13:05.125
Hundreds have gathered here and in
other cities across the country

13:05.153 --> 13:07.129
to take a stand against
what they say

13:07.130 --> 13:10.104
is greed and corruption...

13:13.328 --> 13:14.369
Oh, my God.

13:14.370 --> 13:15.390
Ohh.

13:15.390 --> 13:17.386
<i>So far no suspects
have been named in the bombing.</i>

13:17.387 --> 13:18.410
Thank you.

13:18.411 --> 13:20.332
You're welcome.

13:20.332 --> 13:21.390
So how's our...

13:21.391 --> 13:23.988
how's our girl doing?

13:24.023 --> 13:27.048
She's upstairs in bed, asleep.

13:27.048 --> 13:29.052
I wish I could
keep her in there.

13:31.031 --> 13:32.067
Honey, do you ever wonder

13:32.068 --> 13:34.050
why I never visited you
at the precinct

13:34.051 --> 13:36.046
the first year
you were working there?

13:36.047 --> 13:38.031
I always thought it was
because of the harsh lighting.

13:38.032 --> 13:41.051
Well, that was a consideration.

13:41.052 --> 13:43.989
No, I thought if I...
if I saw you

13:43.990 --> 13:45.972
acting like a cop,

13:45.973 --> 13:48.011
I'd start thinking of you
as a cop,

13:48.011 --> 13:49.052
and I just... whew.

13:49.053 --> 13:53.005
That... that brought on
all manner of nightmares.

13:53.006 --> 13:54.990
How did you get over it?

13:54.990 --> 13:56.044
Eventually, you realize,

13:56.045 --> 13:59.026
your children are gonna
make choices you don't like.

13:59.027 --> 14:01.031
Just a fact of life.

14:01.031 --> 14:02.994
Well, if the bombing
proves anything,

14:02.995 --> 14:05.980
it's that bad things can happen
no matter what you do.

14:05.981 --> 14:10.060
Nobody's tomorrow
is guaranteed.

14:10.061 --> 14:13.005
So... how do you

14:13.006 --> 14:14.977
plan to act
on this realization?

14:14.977 --> 14:15.996
What do you mean?

14:15.997 --> 14:17.038
Oh, you know what I mean.

14:17.039 --> 14:19.061
Richard, how much longer
are you gonna drag your heels

14:19.062 --> 14:22.026
before you tell Beckett
how you feel?

14:22.027 --> 14:24.977
And I mean while she is awake,
not lying on the ground

14:24.991 --> 14:26.075
with a bullet in her chest.

14:26.076 --> 14:27.994
You don't understand...

14:27.995 --> 14:29.994
It's complicated, so you say.

14:29.995 --> 14:32.053
Only it's not.

14:32.054 --> 14:35.015
It's not.

14:35.016 --> 14:38.990
Nobody's tomorrows
are guaranteed, right?

14:38.991 --> 14:40.987
Wouldn't it be better
to tell her

14:40.987 --> 14:42.058
even if the timing is wrong

14:42.059 --> 14:44.066
than never to tell her at all?

14:47.049 --> 14:50.019
And what if she isn't ready?

14:50.020 --> 14:52.049
Then she never will be.

14:52.049 --> 14:54.070
Then you move on.

15:03.580 --> 15:04.650
Hey.

15:04.651 --> 15:06.650
Hey. Thanks.

15:06.651 --> 15:08.692
Yeah. You got a sec?

15:08.748 --> 15:09.596
Yeah. What's up?

15:10.004 --> 15:11.010
Um...

15:11.011 --> 15:13.931
I've been thinking...

15:13.932 --> 15:16.932
about the victims and...

15:16.932 --> 15:19.970
all the opportunities
they'll never have...

15:22.965 --> 15:25.990
and I don't want that
to happen.

15:27.986 --> 15:29.940
I've been...

15:29.940 --> 15:30.990
Beckett.

15:32.688 --> 15:33.730
We got something.

15:33.731 --> 15:35.738
Um...

15:35.738 --> 15:38.747
It's okay. It can wait
till after the case.

15:46.709 --> 15:49.076
Did you get the video
from the Plaza?

15:49.097 --> 15:50.874
Not yet, but what I have
here is even better.

15:50.874 --> 15:54.811
Data from wireless carriers that shows
us all the GPS-activated cell phones

15:54.831 --> 15:55.703
in Boylan Plaza.

15:56.889 --> 15:58.873
This is the Plaza
yesterday at 4:32,

15:58.874 --> 16:00.035
right before the explosion.

16:00.038 --> 16:03.016
Each red dot represents the GPS
position of a specific phone.

16:03.017 --> 16:05.046
How did you get this?

16:05.046 --> 16:07.063
I called in a favor from
a friend at Homeland Security.

16:07.064 --> 16:09.038
That is a damn good friend.

16:09.038 --> 16:11.011
So then if those red dots
represent cell phones,

16:11.012 --> 16:12.275
can we figure out
who they belong to?

16:12.365 --> 16:13.976
That's the whole idea.

16:14.058 --> 16:16.091
If this shows us
who was closest to the bomb,

16:16.092 --> 16:18.063
it gives us our witnesses.

16:18.063 --> 16:20.063
It can even show us
where everyone was in real time.

16:20.064 --> 16:22.034
Advance it to 4:32.

16:28.071 --> 16:30.049
<i>11 dresses.</i>

16:30.050 --> 16:33.028
<i>What they say
is greed and corruption...</i>

16:33.089 --> 16:35.892
The dots that disappeared,
that's the explosion.

16:35.967 --> 16:36.984
Wait a second.
You guys see that?

16:36.985 --> 16:38.000
There was...

16:38.001 --> 16:39.963
right before the bomb went off.

16:39.963 --> 16:42.022
Ryan, could you take it
back ten seconds?

16:45.942 --> 16:47.962
That dot right there.

16:47.963 --> 16:49.962
Right before the explosion,

16:49.963 --> 16:51.983
it goes to the blast site,

16:51.984 --> 16:53.941
waits for a second,

16:53.942 --> 16:55.951
and then rushes away.

16:55.951 --> 16:57.984
Play it again.

17:00.009 --> 17:01.979
<i>You tried on 11 dresses.</i>

17:01.980 --> 17:04.001
That's the bomber.

17:04.001 --> 17:05.997
I just need
to pull up his I.D.

17:07.021 --> 17:09.954
Cell phone's registered
to an Andrew Haynes.

17:09.954 --> 17:10.988
Tell me where he is right now.

17:14.997 --> 17:16.954
No GPS signal.

17:16.954 --> 17:19.963
Uh, his battery's either dead
or his phone is off.

17:19.963 --> 17:23.001
Wait a minute.
Haynes sounds familiar.

17:26.951 --> 17:30.934
He showed up in the precinct
20 minutes ago for an interview.

17:30.934 --> 17:32.009
The bomber's in the building?

17:35.675 --> 17:37.595
UNIS gave him a full body.

17:37.595 --> 17:38.605
No weapons.
No explosives.

17:38.606 --> 17:40.587
He still thinks
he's here as a witness?

17:40.587 --> 17:42.066
We told him
the search was routine.

17:42.311 --> 17:44.404
So this is Andrew Haynes.

17:44.529 --> 17:45.547
What's his story?

17:45.548 --> 17:47.501
He has it out
for the TakeOver! movement.

17:47.502 --> 17:48.979
He's organized
counterdemonstrations,

17:49.075 --> 17:51.461
disrupted their rallies,
he's even handed out fliers

17:51.551 --> 17:53.545
saying how they should be
stopped by any means necessary.

17:53.561 --> 17:55.531
He walks the walk, too.
He was a suspect in the bombing

17:55.532 --> 17:57.501
of some Greenpeace offices
a few years back.

17:57.502 --> 17:58.558
Anything turn up at his place?

17:58.559 --> 18:00.490
Yeah, a smoking gun.

18:00.491 --> 18:03.003
UNIS found receipts to
an Internet cafe where he goes.

18:03.054 --> 18:04.515
Now they traced
those e-mail threats

18:04.565 --> 18:06.503
back to that cafe
and Haynes log-in I.D.

18:06.504 --> 18:07.533
He's our guy.

18:07.533 --> 18:09.493
So then why is he
strolling in here

18:09.494 --> 18:10.543
just as cool as could be?

18:10.544 --> 18:12.497
My guess...
he's proud of what he's done,

18:12.498 --> 18:13.577
can't wait to tell someone
about it.

18:13.578 --> 18:15.570
Well, then let's give him
the opportunity

18:15.571 --> 18:18.532
to do just that.

18:18.533 --> 18:20.491
Hi, Mr. Haynes.

18:20.491 --> 18:21.585
I'm detective Kate Beckett.

18:21.586 --> 18:23.501
<i>Thank you so much
for coming in.</i>

18:23.502 --> 18:25.493
<i>It's about time
you brought me in here.</i>

18:25.494 --> 18:26.533
<i>If I had to rub elbows</i>

18:26.534 --> 18:28.557
<i>with those whiny
little troublemakers...</i>

18:28.558 --> 18:30.502
I was
gonna do something drastic.

18:30.503 --> 18:32.573
Oh, yeah, well,
I wouldn't blame you.

18:32.574 --> 18:35.490
Hey, free thinker.
I respect that.

18:35.491 --> 18:37.008
Um, you know,
my personal feelings aside,

18:37.093 --> 18:38.530
I still have to investigate
this incident.

18:38.546 --> 18:41.516
Yeah, you know, you... you gotta
dot your i's, cross your T's.

18:41.516 --> 18:42.574
<i>I get that.</i>

18:42.575 --> 18:45.516
<i>Exactly. So I just have to
ask you a few questions</i>

18:45.516 --> 18:47.535
<i>about what you saw
just before the bombing,</i>

18:47.536 --> 18:48.587
starting with...

18:48.588 --> 18:50.578
Where you were.

18:50.579 --> 18:53.498
Um...

18:53.499 --> 18:55.515
I, uh, I-I was...

18:55.516 --> 18:57.502
I was, like, right up here.

18:57.503 --> 18:59.502
Um, so that's

18:59.503 --> 19:01.515
about 100 feet
from the blast site?

19:01.516 --> 19:02.524
Yeah.

19:02.524 --> 19:03.572
And what were you doing there?

19:03.573 --> 19:05.564
Oh, I was, uh, pretty much
getting hassled.

19:05.633 --> 19:08.272
Hey, nimrod. Here.
Educate yourself.

19:08.352 --> 19:10.306
Here. Why don't you
give this a read?

19:10.514 --> 19:11.531
Hey, garanimal pants.

19:11.532 --> 19:14.497
Quit the pity party.
Get a freakin' job.

19:14.498 --> 19:17.102
Pull yourself up
by your bootstraps. Hello.

19:17.155 --> 19:18.201
Hey! I'm talking to you.

19:18.202 --> 19:20.159
Kitten, can you take...

19:20.448 --> 19:21.463
what's your problem?

19:21.464 --> 19:23.451
- You don't like what I have to say?
- Sorry.

19:23.452 --> 19:24.511
Huh? Can't face the truth?

19:24.512 --> 19:26.944
<i>I'm sorry.
Just... just so I'm clear, so...</i>

19:26.988 --> 19:29.136
you were debating with the
protesters until that bomb went off?

19:29.188 --> 19:31.162
Yeah, I was trying to give 'em
a reality check.

19:31.163 --> 19:34.048
<i>I mean, you know, they're all up in
arms about the greedy corporation,</i>

19:34.089 --> 19:35.800
<i>and who do they think
is creating the jobs?</i>

19:35.868 --> 19:37.774
<i>You know, they're a bunch
of silver-spoon hypocrites.</i>

19:37.855 --> 19:38.867
I mean, half of them,
they don't...

19:38.934 --> 19:41.299
they don't even know
who they're protesting against.

19:41.343 --> 19:42.371
Right, and stopping them

19:42.372 --> 19:44.311
would actually be a service
to this country.

19:50.340 --> 19:52.310
Yeah, it'd be item number one

19:52.311 --> 19:54.310
on any true patriot's
to-do list.

19:54.311 --> 19:56.327
- And you are a true patriot,
aren't you, Andrew?
- You're damn right about that.

19:56.328 --> 19:57.405
That's why you put that bomb
in the Plaza,

19:57.406 --> 19:59.399
to defend the country
that you love?

20:05.311 --> 20:07.353
What are you talking about?

20:07.353 --> 20:08.394
<i>Come on, Andrew.
I don't want you</i>

20:08.395 --> 20:11.360
<i>to have to serve any more time
than you have to.</i>

20:11.361 --> 20:13.372
We know that you weren't
with those protesters.

20:13.373 --> 20:16.310
You were down here,
dropping off the bomb

20:16.311 --> 20:18.339
- and then running for cover.
- Based on what?

20:18.340 --> 20:19.361
We traced your phone.

20:19.362 --> 20:21.344
The GPS places you right there.

20:21.344 --> 20:23.332
You can't prove it was me.
I lost my phone yesterday.

20:23.333 --> 20:25.327
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

20:25.328 --> 20:28.332
Okay, then maybe
you can explain this.

20:31.268 --> 20:34.250
Threatening e-mails that you
sent from an Internet cafe,

20:34.251 --> 20:36.250
promising to continue
those bombings

20:36.251 --> 20:39.318
until the protests stopped.

20:39.318 --> 20:42.272
I'd like to talk to my lawyer.

20:45.276 --> 20:49.262
White male, antisocial loner,
extreme political views...

20:49.351 --> 20:52.491
He's a perfect fit for the
profile B.S.U. worked up for us.

20:52.530 --> 20:54.558
We'll continue questioning him
downtown.

20:54.559 --> 20:57.508
Well, according to my people,
he's nowhere near confessing.

20:57.509 --> 20:59.563
Well, have them
reinterview the witnesses

20:59.563 --> 21:02.547
and find us someone that saw
Haynes put that backpack down.

21:05.509 --> 21:07.217
You're welcome.

21:07.283 --> 21:09.249
So we talked to 20 witnesses
along Haynes' GPS path,

21:10.032 --> 21:11.720
but none of them
can positively I.D. him.

21:11.809 --> 21:13.879
With all the confusion, no one's
exactly sure what happened.

21:13.937 --> 21:14.953
You guys have any luck?

21:15.015 --> 21:18.338
Four people remember seeing a guy
in a black TakeOver! hoodie,

21:18.369 --> 21:20.144
but nobody remembers
seeing his face.

21:20.215 --> 21:21.377
A black hoodie
doesn't get us home,

21:21.475 --> 21:23.468
not with half
the protesters wearing them.

21:23.542 --> 21:24.803
Somebody had to have
seen this guy.

21:24.889 --> 21:26.820
There's a protester
we haven't spoken to yet...

21:26.883 --> 21:28.074
the street drummer.

21:28.538 --> 21:30.587
<i>TakeOver! Wall Street!</i>

21:30.810 --> 21:32.818
After the cameraman
rousted him,

21:32.819 --> 21:35.747
that bridesmaid said
he relocated...

21:35.887 --> 21:38.256
By the coffee truck, which would
put him right in Haynes' path.

21:38.272 --> 21:40.179
Which means he could've seen
Haynes' face.

21:40.180 --> 21:41.200
Yeah, but we don't know
his name

21:41.201 --> 21:42.223
and he's not on
our witness list.

21:42.224 --> 21:44.192
How are we gonna find this guy?

21:45.069 --> 21:47.152
You know what?
He's a street performer.

21:47.153 --> 21:50.068
He's probably gotten nuisance
citations, which means,

21:50.069 --> 21:52.131
if he has, we should be able
to I.D. him.

21:53.656 --> 21:56.318
I make music.
Why do you arrest me?

21:56.321 --> 21:57.921
We're not arresting you, Malik.

21:57.996 --> 22:00.044
We just need to ask you a few
questions about what you saw

22:00.045 --> 22:01.981
in Boylan Plaza
yesterday afternoon.

22:01.982 --> 22:03.437
I know nothing about the bomb.

22:03.510 --> 22:05.508
- I am an innocent man.
- And we believe you.

22:05.509 --> 22:07.467
But we think that
you might have seen something

22:07.468 --> 22:09.541
that'll help us catch
the person who did this.

22:09.542 --> 22:13.529
I-I don't want trouble.

22:13.530 --> 22:16.171
Malik, your visa expired,
didn't it?

22:16.176 --> 22:17.402
Is that what's worrying you?

22:17.498 --> 22:18.963
I cannot go back to my country.

22:19.006 --> 22:20.000
And I won't make you.

22:20.020 --> 22:21.995
I don't care about
your immigration status.

22:22.007 --> 22:22.661
We just need to know

22:22.694 --> 22:25.689
exactly what you saw
just before that explosion.

22:28.752 --> 22:30.782
I will tell you what I can.

22:32.794 --> 22:34.248
Okay.

22:34.277 --> 22:35.329
TakeOver! Wall Street!

22:35.330 --> 22:37.350
<i>When you were playing
by the coffee truck,</i>

22:37.351 --> 22:40.502
<i>a man walked by you wearing
a black TakeOver! sweatshirt.</i>

22:40.571 --> 22:41.429
<i>Do you remember seeing him?</i>

22:41.449 --> 22:43.409
<i>Yes. I saw him.</i>

22:43.410 --> 22:44.489
TakeOver! Wall Street!
TakeOver! Wall Street!

22:44.577 --> 22:45.496
Wait a minute.

22:45.515 --> 22:46.057
Are you saying

22:46.111 --> 22:48.482
that you saw the man
wearing the TakeOver! sweatshirt

22:48.494 --> 22:50.474
put down a blue backpack
in front of the lamppost?

22:51.428 --> 22:53.442
- Yes.
- Did you get a good look at his face?

22:53.443 --> 22:55.460
Damn it!

22:55.460 --> 22:56.472
TakeOver! Wall Street!

22:58.414 --> 23:00.493
You're certain the man you saw
leaving the backpack

23:00.494 --> 23:03.414
<i>was hispanic and in his 20s?</i>

23:03.414 --> 23:04.489
<i>Yes.</i>

23:06.502 --> 23:08.413
I-I gave the wrong answer?

23:08.414 --> 23:10.443
Are you sure
this wasn't the person?

23:10.443 --> 23:12.485
No. That's not him.

23:15.460 --> 23:17.426
The FBI has got the wrong guy.

23:17.427 --> 23:21.413
Which means the real bomber
is still out there.

23:25.790 --> 23:27.805
If Andrew Haynes
didn't plant the bomb,

23:27.904 --> 23:30.134
then why did he e-mail
those threats?

23:30.211 --> 23:32.231
Why does his GPS show him
fleeing the scene?

23:32.679 --> 23:33.698
We can't answer that yet,

23:33.699 --> 23:35.658
but our witness gave
a good description.

23:35.659 --> 23:37.684
It was this man.

23:37.684 --> 23:39.252
How do we know this guy
is not making this up?

23:39.270 --> 23:40.311
Look, the details of the bomb

23:40.704 --> 23:42.274
haven't been released
to the press yet,

23:42.372 --> 23:44.148
so how would our witness know
about the blue backpack

23:44.184 --> 23:45.425
unless he actually saw it?

23:47.823 --> 23:48.860
All right,
you people pursue this.

23:48.861 --> 23:49.902
See where it leads.

23:49.986 --> 23:52.195
But Andrew Haynes
is still our prime suspect.

23:52.358 --> 23:54.361
At least until you can give me
something more

23:54.362 --> 23:57.319
than the word
of a street musician.

23:57.320 --> 23:59.340
Identifying this man,

23:59.341 --> 24:01.820
that is now our top priority.

24:01.841 --> 24:02.860
According to our witness,

24:02.861 --> 24:04.839
he was wearing
a TakeOver! sweatshirt,

24:04.840 --> 24:06.301
so he might be
part of the movement.

24:06.379 --> 24:08.418
Show this sketch around,
talk to other protesters.

24:08.419 --> 24:13.443
If he was a regular in Boylan Plaza,
someone there must know who he is.

24:13.443 --> 24:15.434
Uh, not you, Mr. Castle.

24:17.372 --> 24:19.392
I have a special task for you.

24:19.393 --> 24:21.422
I hear that you're
quite the speed reader,

24:21.422 --> 24:23.393
and in the time
that I've known you,

24:23.394 --> 24:25.392
you've shown, well...

24:25.393 --> 24:28.442
On occasion, an exceptional
attention to detail.

24:28.443 --> 24:31.417
That's the first time you've
ever paid me a complime...

24:31.418 --> 24:32.780
Go on.

24:32.850 --> 24:34.892
We've conducted over a hundred
interviews so far,

24:35.713 --> 24:37.749
and someone needs to
review them swiftly,

24:37.750 --> 24:40.745
looking for information that can
help us I.D. our suspect.

24:40.745 --> 24:44.670
And, uh, I believe,
you're my best bet.

24:48.687 --> 24:50.674
I think she's finally
starting to like me.

24:50.675 --> 24:53.662
No, I'm not.

24:56.758 --> 24:58.704
Wearing her down.

25:02.679 --> 25:04.678
- Good morning.
- Morning.

25:04.679 --> 25:05.700
Any breaks in the case?

25:05.701 --> 25:06.740
No.

25:06.741 --> 25:09.695
I've been poring over
these witness statements

25:09.695 --> 25:11.685
looking for clues
about our bomber,

25:11.686 --> 25:12.729
but so far, nothing.

25:12.730 --> 25:16.670
Well, maybe these
will bring you some luck.

25:18.687 --> 25:20.391
These are emergency
cheering-up pancakes.

25:20.440 --> 25:23.213
I mean, these are usually
reserved for after breakups

25:23.258 --> 25:24.771
or "Dancing With the Stars"
eliminations.

25:24.930 --> 25:27.608
- What's the occasion?
- Well, after the other day,

25:27.679 --> 25:29.720
I thought we both needed
some cheering up.

25:32.679 --> 25:34.200
You shouldn't need cheering up.

25:34.231 --> 25:35.874
You shouldn't have even
been there.

25:35.972 --> 25:37.915
You should've been
with your friends

25:37.916 --> 25:38.888
or at the movies.

25:38.938 --> 25:39.946
- Dad, I'm 18.
- I know.

25:39.947 --> 25:41.962
I know. It's just...

25:41.963 --> 25:46.942
You're gonna see plenty
of reality in your lifetime.

25:46.942 --> 25:49.740
I just would like you to keep
the rose color on your glasses

25:49.755 --> 25:50.836
for as long as possible.

25:50.837 --> 25:55.781
But I'm trying not to focus
on the ugly side of it, dad.

25:55.782 --> 25:59.768
I-I've gotten straight a's,

25:59.769 --> 26:01.839
awards, more trophies
than I can count.

26:01.840 --> 26:03.839
This job is the first thing

26:03.840 --> 26:06.805
that's made me feel like I'm
doing something important,

26:06.806 --> 26:08.777
valuable.

26:08.777 --> 26:11.777
I mean, isn't that
why you do it?

26:13.798 --> 26:15.822
You're a pretty smart kid,
you know that?

26:15.823 --> 26:17.785
Well...

26:17.786 --> 26:20.755
They say genius...

26:20.756 --> 26:22.805
Skips a generation.

26:22.806 --> 26:24.761
Apparently, so does funny.

26:24.761 --> 26:25.827
Eat your pancake.

26:25.828 --> 26:28.752
Right.

26:38.175 --> 26:39.259
Beckett.

26:41.238 --> 26:42.259
What's going on?

26:42.260 --> 26:43.480
Um, nothing.

26:43.544 --> 26:45.233
I'm just thinking about
my next move.

26:45.320 --> 26:46.342
I may have it for you.

26:46.343 --> 26:48.025
We got a line on this guy.

26:48.116 --> 26:48.885
Someone I.D.'ed the sketch?

26:48.935 --> 26:50.367
Yeah, a protester
named Jenni Klein,

26:50.368 --> 26:52.325
says she knows this guy
as Bobby.

26:52.325 --> 26:53.355
And there's no last name?

26:53.356 --> 26:56.338
No, but this Bobby
invited her over once.

26:56.338 --> 26:58.330
She knows where he lives.

27:03.396 --> 27:05.341
Hey, Bobby.

27:05.342 --> 27:07.338
Remove the backpack

27:07.338 --> 27:09.332
and place it on the ground,
slowly.

27:09.333 --> 27:10.342
Then get on your knees.

27:24.334 --> 27:26.363
Just a bunch of gym clothes
and some water bottles.

27:26.364 --> 27:28.325
Not like last time, huh, Bobby?

27:33.359 --> 27:35.333
Get up.

27:35.334 --> 27:37.320
Robert Lopez.

27:37.321 --> 27:39.325
That's your name.

27:39.325 --> 27:42.321
Right, Bobby?

27:43.375 --> 27:46.329
Actually, I know
quite a bit about you.

27:46.330 --> 27:48.317
I know where you live.

27:48.324 --> 27:49.472
I know you don't have a record.

27:49.563 --> 27:51.526
I know you're not a member
of any political party.

27:51.526 --> 27:54.487
And as soon as my team
finishes searching your place,

27:54.488 --> 27:56.450
I'm gonna know even more.

27:56.620 --> 27:58.690
So eventually, I'll find out,
but why don't you just tell me?

28:00.538 --> 28:04.496
<i>Why </i> did you plant that bomb?

28:13.542 --> 28:16.484
Hey. No luck
with those witness statements.

28:16.484 --> 28:17.502
You guys catch a break?

28:17.503 --> 28:18.965
Better yet,
we caught the suspect.

28:19.057 --> 28:20.230
And I missed it?
Where is he?

28:20.493 --> 28:22.521
In the box with Beckett.

28:22.521 --> 28:25.463
Would you like me
to refresh your memory?

28:26.467 --> 28:29.470
<i>You were standing here
by the lamppost.</i>

28:29.471 --> 28:31.467
<i>You dropped the backpack</i>

28:31.467 --> 28:33.448
<i>and then you started running
as it exploded</i>

28:33.449 --> 28:34.540
<i>and killed five people.</i>

28:34.541 --> 28:36.456
<i>I didn't... I didn't do
what you're saying.</i>

28:36.457 --> 28:38.469
<i>Witnesses saw you
drop your backpack, Bobby.</i>

28:38.470 --> 28:39.486
<i>It wasn't mine.</i>

28:39.487 --> 28:40.523
Oh, so you admit to having it?

28:40.524 --> 28:42.065
No. That's... that's not
what I meant.

28:42.100 --> 28:43.395
You just said
that it wasn't yours.

28:43.433 --> 28:44.655
Yeah, because you got me
all confused...

28:44.685 --> 28:46.446
Did you or didn't you have it?

28:46.446 --> 28:47.471
It's a simple question.

28:47.472 --> 28:49.450
I don't know.

28:49.450 --> 28:50.488
Who put you up to this, Bobby?

28:50.489 --> 28:52.463
Who gave you that backpack?

28:52.463 --> 28:53.542
I don't... I don't know.
I don't remember.

28:53.543 --> 28:56.470
- You don't remember?
How do you not remember?
- I was in shock.

28:56.471 --> 28:58.006
<i>The bomb went off. Everyone
was running and screaming...</i>

28:58.080 --> 29:00.124
<i>Oh, okay, okay,
so remember what happened</i>

29:00.186 --> 29:02.274
<i>after the bomb went off,
but not before.</i>

29:02.356 --> 29:03.938
<i>It must have been one of those</i>
traumatic amnesia things.

29:03.983 --> 29:06.296
<i>Bobby... </i>
don't lie to me.

29:06.361 --> 29:08.097
I'm telling you,
it was all a big blank.

29:08.173 --> 29:09.192
It was the trauma.

29:09.280 --> 29:10.302
It was not the trauma.

29:10.303 --> 29:12.035
You don't get to use
that excuse.

29:12.128 --> 29:13.177
I swear, I don't remember.

29:13.238 --> 29:15.040
The hell you don't remember.

29:15.108 --> 29:16.480
<i>Do you want to know trauma?</i>

29:16.557 --> 29:19.506
<i>I was shot in the chest
and I remember</i>

29:19.506 --> 29:21.540
every second of it.

29:23.594 --> 29:25.564
<i>And so do you.</i>

29:29.531 --> 29:31.564
All this time...

29:34.569 --> 29:36.563
You remembered?

29:46.130 --> 29:47.136
Guy's still not talking?

29:47.137 --> 29:49.109
Not yet. I'm gonna let him
sweat for a bit.

29:50.002 --> 29:51.612
Was Castle here?

29:51.685 --> 29:52.722
Yeah, earlier.

29:52.723 --> 29:54.685
But he said he had to go.

29:54.685 --> 29:56.694
Said there was somewhere
he needed to be.

29:59.698 --> 30:01.738
Oh, Richard...

30:01.739 --> 30:04.659
A bomb memorial?

30:04.660 --> 30:06.660
Come on, honey.
Isn't this kind of morbid?

30:06.660 --> 30:07.698
Well, it's how I'm feeling.

30:07.699 --> 30:09.660
She isn't dead.

30:09.660 --> 30:11.660
She might as well be.

30:12.272 --> 30:14.226
I really thought we could
have a future together.

30:14.286 --> 30:16.534
You know, I was...
I was willing to wait.

30:18.698 --> 30:22.659
Come to find out,
it's all just a big joke.

30:22.660 --> 30:24.681
She knew.

30:24.681 --> 30:25.718
This whole time,
she remembered,

30:25.719 --> 30:28.689
and she didn't say anything...

30:28.689 --> 30:29.750
Because she was embarrassed

30:29.751 --> 30:31.727
because she doesn't feel
the same way.

30:33.702 --> 30:35.681
I'm such a fool.

30:43.681 --> 30:45.705
Well, come on.
Let's go home.

30:45.706 --> 30:47.706
Break out some of
the good stuff, okay?

30:47.706 --> 30:49.694
Oh, I'd love to.
I gotta be getting back.

30:49.695 --> 30:50.713
Back?

30:50.714 --> 30:52.709
Why on earth would you go back

30:52.710 --> 30:55.713
knowing how she feels,
knowing that she lied to you...

30:55.714 --> 30:58.734
no, no, no, no, this isn't
about her. This is...

30:58.735 --> 31:00.693
This is about them.

31:00.694 --> 31:04.659
You know, it's about
doing something real...

31:04.660 --> 31:07.656
Something that matters.

31:07.656 --> 31:09.727
I'm not willing to let that go.

31:12.689 --> 31:14.688
Richard, love is not a switch.

31:14.689 --> 31:16.714
You can't just turn it off.

31:16.714 --> 31:20.685
You can't work side by side
with her and not feel anything.

31:23.698 --> 31:25.689
Watch me.

31:31.727 --> 31:33.656
Hey.

31:33.656 --> 31:34.677
Hey. Where were you?

31:34.678 --> 31:36.701
Just clearing my head.
Where are we on Bobby?

31:36.702 --> 31:38.693
Uniforms are searching
his place.

31:38.694 --> 31:41.663
We're hoping to find
something that'll break him.

31:41.664 --> 31:44.281
FBI called with an update.

31:44.337 --> 31:45.974
The device used in Boylan Plaza

31:46.006 --> 31:48.034
was a pipe bomb,
but here's the weird part...

31:48.035 --> 31:50.943
it wasn't packed with nails,
ball bearings, or anything else.

31:50.943 --> 31:53.984
That is weird. Bombers usually add
projectiles to maximize damage.

31:53.985 --> 31:55.988
That's not the only way
to maximize damage.

31:55.989 --> 31:57.943
Uh...

31:57.943 --> 31:59.014
So what was it triggered by,

31:59.015 --> 32:00.276
cell phone, trip wire?

32:00.307 --> 32:02.282
A remote, probably rigged
from a garage door opener.

32:02.283 --> 32:04.319
But the range on those
is only about 100 feet.

32:04.320 --> 32:06.716
So whoever detonated it
was in Boylan Plaza.

32:06.716 --> 32:08.635
And I bet you will find
that garage remote

32:08.636 --> 32:09.649
in Bobby's apartment.

32:09.650 --> 32:11.662
Uh, no such luck. But...

32:11.662 --> 32:12.708
We did find credit cards

32:12.709 --> 32:15.636
with lots of different
names on them.

32:15.637 --> 32:17.662
And we found some wallets

32:17.662 --> 32:18.725
and some cell phones, too.

32:18.726 --> 32:20.682
In fact,
one of those cell phones

32:20.683 --> 32:22.661
belonged to Andrew Haynes.

32:22.662 --> 32:24.665
Bobby's a pickpocket.

32:24.666 --> 32:26.661
Yeah, I pretty much am.

32:26.662 --> 32:28.719
That's why you attended
the TakeOver! protests?

32:28.720 --> 32:31.703
All those people hanging out,
full of peace and brotherhood...

32:31.704 --> 32:33.682
TakeOver! Wall Street!

32:33.683 --> 32:35.024
- TakeOver! Wall Street!
- Wall Street,

32:35.025 --> 32:36.665
- What do we want?
- TakeOver! Wall Street!

32:36.666 --> 32:39.670
Hey, nimrod. Here.
Educate yourself.

32:39.670 --> 32:40.729
Here. Educate...

32:40.730 --> 32:43.670
TakeOver! Wall Street!
TakeOver! Wall Street!

32:43.670 --> 32:45.666
<i>Like
an all-you-can-steal buffet.</i>

32:45.667 --> 32:47.049
You got that right.

32:47.105 --> 32:49.005
Why didn't you just tell me
the truth from the start?

32:49.053 --> 32:51.079
And what, admit to a cop
that likes me for murder

32:51.080 --> 32:53.042
that I'm a thief?

32:53.042 --> 32:55.021
Amnesia seemed like
the better plan.

32:55.022 --> 32:56.066
Yeah.

32:56.067 --> 32:59.004
So you lifted
Andrew Haynes' phone,

32:59.004 --> 33:01.002
which is why it looked
as if he planted the bomb.

33:01.003 --> 33:02.645
- Who's Andrew Haynes?
- Don't worry about that.

33:02.676 --> 33:05.017
Talk to me about the backpack.
How did you get it?

33:05.017 --> 33:06.698
You know, you people,
you're a virus.

33:06.758 --> 33:07.788
You're irresponsible.

33:07.789 --> 33:09.787
You're infecting this country.

33:09.788 --> 33:11.755
Hello. Can you hear?

33:11.755 --> 33:13.780
You probably couldn't hear
your... do you <i>hablas </i> English?

33:13.781 --> 33:14.829
I lifted it.

33:14.830 --> 33:17.846
<i>It was just lying there
between two dumpsters.</i>

33:17.847 --> 33:19.787
Hey! Hey, that's mine.

33:19.788 --> 33:21.800
Give me that. That's mine!
Give that back.

33:21.801 --> 33:23.780
Hey!

33:23.780 --> 33:24.813
Hey! Hey, hey,
that's my bag.

33:24.814 --> 33:26.816
TakeOver! Wall Street!

33:26.817 --> 33:29.842
- Come back!
- TakeOver! Wall Street!
TakeOver! Wall Street!

33:29.843 --> 33:31.793
Come back here.
Hey, hey, you.

33:31.793 --> 33:33.755
This close
to bridezilla territory.

33:33.756 --> 33:35.780
Oh, maybe I'll wear
jeans to my wedding.

33:35.780 --> 33:37.551
Maybe we can hire that guy
as the band.

33:38.506 --> 33:40.489
Damn it!

33:46.393 --> 33:48.379
I swear, I...

33:48.380 --> 33:51.342
I didn't know a bomb was in it.

33:51.343 --> 33:54.339
I would never hurt anyone.

33:54.339 --> 33:56.339
Look, you gotta believe me.

33:58.305 --> 34:01.362
The man who said
that you took his backpack,

34:01.363 --> 34:03.354
is that him?

34:03.355 --> 34:05.725
Yeah. That... that's...
that's the guy.

34:05.815 --> 34:06.822
Are you sure?

34:06.823 --> 34:08.828
<i>Yeah.</i>

34:08.828 --> 34:09.844
<i>Yeah, that's him.</i>

34:09.844 --> 34:11.828
<i>That's Jesse Friedman.</i>

34:12.221 --> 34:13.266
He's one of the victims.

34:13.266 --> 34:16.277
And he's a member
of the movement.

34:16.279 --> 34:17.199
That doesn't make any sense.

34:17.283 --> 34:18.540
Why would he attack
his own people?

34:47.172 --> 34:48.255
Okay. Thank you.

34:48.257 --> 34:51.217
So UNIS searched
Jesse Friedman's place.

34:51.217 --> 34:53.217
And they found research
on how to build

34:53.217 --> 34:56.179
the same device that was
used in Boylan Plaza.

34:56.179 --> 34:58.229
So Jesse blew up
his own protest?

34:58.230 --> 35:00.171
Why would he do that?

35:00.172 --> 35:02.268
Maybe to get sympathy
for his movement, publicity...

35:02.296 --> 35:04.166
And since he placed the bomb
between two dumpsters...

35:04.225 --> 35:06.199
He didn't think that anyone
would get hurt.

35:06.200 --> 35:07.962
Then Bobby stole the backpack.

35:07.991 --> 35:09.988
If Jesse was worried about
someone getting hurt,

35:09.989 --> 35:11.974
why would he set off the bomb?

35:11.975 --> 35:13.407
I don't think he did.

35:13.459 --> 35:15.259
There was no remote found on
or near the body,

35:15.281 --> 35:16.784
which means someone else
detonated it.

35:16.989 --> 35:18.278
Probably somebody he knew.

35:18.366 --> 35:19.483
30 seconds before the blast,

35:19.507 --> 35:21.907
Jesse got a call on his cell
from a burner phone.

35:21.965 --> 35:23.984
Then two seconds before
the bomb went off,

35:23.985 --> 35:26.439
he tried to call
that same phone back.

35:26.439 --> 35:27.753
So then maybe
Jesse had a partner,

35:27.766 --> 35:29.757
and that's who triggered
the bomb.

35:29.758 --> 35:32.563
You said that remote had a range
of about 100 feet, right?

35:32.867 --> 35:33.401
Mm-hmm.

35:33.408 --> 35:36.163
So whoever the partner was, he
must have been here somewhere,

35:36.390 --> 35:37.834
close to the bomb blast,

35:38.046 --> 35:40.350
hidden among the crowd.

35:40.396 --> 35:42.964
We need to take another look
at the sequence of events,

35:42.987 --> 35:44.518
piece together
the witness statements.

35:44.825 --> 35:46.833
The answer is in the story.

35:46.834 --> 35:48.621
So let's start
at the beginning.

35:48.678 --> 35:49.762
TakeOver! Wall Street!

35:49.763 --> 35:51.706
TakeOver! Wall Street!

35:51.707 --> 35:54.274
TakeOver! Wall Street!
TakeOver! Wall Street!

35:54.281 --> 35:55.772
<i>Leann and her
cameraman are setting up</i>

35:55.830 --> 35:56.683
<i>for their live broadcast.</i>

35:56.727 --> 35:58.736
Be sure you get the crowd
in the background, Mark.

35:59.583 --> 36:01.820
Another shot of you
and the chanting masses.

36:01.859 --> 36:02.874
I'm so over this protest.

36:02.875 --> 36:05.928
Yeah, next time we'll do a piece on
Brazilian Runway Models, I promise.

36:06.872 --> 36:07.894
Gonna hold you to that.

36:07.895 --> 36:09.840
All right.
Let's roll this puppy.

36:09.840 --> 36:10.860
TakeOver! Wall Street!

36:10.861 --> 36:11.930
Roger that.

36:11.997 --> 36:14.968
<i>At the same time,
Bobby's prowling the Plaza.</i>

36:14.968 --> 36:17.541
<i>He sees Andrew Haynes
haranguing the protesters.</i>

36:17.541 --> 36:20.552
Quit the pity party. Pull
yourself up by the bootstraps.

36:20.553 --> 36:22.932
Hey, nimrod. Here.
Educate yourself.

36:23.013 --> 36:24.511
Here, why don't you
give this a read?

36:24.600 --> 36:26.586
Hey, garanimal pants.

36:26.903 --> 36:27.916
He's easy pickings.

36:27.917 --> 36:29.373
Here, educ...

36:29.374 --> 36:31.381
<i>So Bobby relieves him
of his phone.</i>

36:31.382 --> 36:33.324
TakeOver! Wall Street!

36:33.324 --> 36:34.422
Educate yourself, would you?

36:34.505 --> 36:38.032
<i>Then Bobby goes looking for his
next business opportunity.</i>

36:38.032 --> 36:40.086
<i>He spots
the blue backpack unattended,</i>

36:40.086 --> 36:42.078
<i>calling out to him.</i>

36:43.124 --> 36:46.028
<i>So he grabs it,</i>

36:46.028 --> 36:48.124
<i>blissfully unaware
of what's inside.</i>

36:50.040 --> 36:51.932
Hey!
Hey, that's mine.

36:51.934 --> 36:53.502
But Jesse sees him
and he flips out.

36:53.609 --> 36:55.273
Give me that.
That's mine!

36:55.332 --> 36:57.373
Hey! Hey! That's mine!
Give that back!

36:57.374 --> 36:59.406
TakeOver! Wall Street!
TakeOver! Wall Street!

36:59.407 --> 37:00.532
TakeOver! Wall Street!

37:00.548 --> 37:02.178
<i>Bobby ducks out of sight.
Jesse panics.</i>

37:02.396 --> 37:04.877
<i>The bomb is on the move.
What's he gonna do?</i>

37:04.971 --> 37:06.983
<i>People are in danger.</i>

37:06.983 --> 37:08.927
<i>He grabs a man
in a black hoodie,</i>

37:08.928 --> 37:09.994
<i>thinking it's the thief.</i>

37:09.995 --> 37:11.953
- What's your problem?
You don't like what I have to say?
- Sorry.

37:11.954 --> 37:13.925
Huh? Can't face the truth?

37:13.925 --> 37:14.967
<i>But it's Andrew Haynes.</i>

37:14.968 --> 37:16.970
TakeOver! Wall Street!
TakeOver! Wall Street!

37:16.971 --> 37:18.029
<i>But by now, Bobby's decided</i>

37:18.038 --> 37:19.934
<i>taking the backpack
wasn't such a good idea.</i>

37:19.943 --> 37:21.987
TakeOver! Wall Street!
TakeOver! Wall Street!

37:21.988 --> 37:24.982
<i>So he ditches it
and keeps moving.</i>

37:24.983 --> 37:27.620
Could you imagine the look
on mom's face?

37:27.685 --> 37:28.742
- Bam.
- Damn it!

37:28.743 --> 37:30.689
<i>They bump into each other,</i>

37:30.689 --> 37:32.610
<i>drawing the attention
of the street drummer</i>

37:32.663 --> 37:34.321
<i>who's now by the coffee truck.</i>

37:34.364 --> 37:37.293
TakeOver! Wall Street!
TakeOver! Wall Street!

37:39.921 --> 37:41.856
<i>The subscriber you're trying</i>

37:41.857 --> 37:43.179
<i>to reach is not available...</i>

37:45.854 --> 37:47.858
He's too late.

37:47.858 --> 37:48.898
Well, that's a nice story, bro,

37:48.899 --> 37:50.856
but it still doesn't tell us
who Jesse's partner is.

37:50.857 --> 37:52.862
Well, it's gotta be whoever
Jesse was on the phone with

37:52.863 --> 37:54.916
in the minutes before
the bomb went off.

37:54.916 --> 37:56.577
How long was that
first incoming call?

37:56.631 --> 37:57.935
Uh, eight seconds.

37:57.942 --> 37:59.923
So that was probably
the "All Systems Go" call.

38:00.245 --> 38:02.183
Then after the backpack
was stolen,

38:02.184 --> 38:04.605
Jesse tried to make
an "All Systems Not Go" call

38:04.820 --> 38:06.293
but he didn't
get through in time.

38:06.333 --> 38:08.721
Do any of the witnesses remember
who Jesse was hanging out with?

38:08.731 --> 38:10.721
Not yet, but we're still
reconstructing his movements

38:10.722 --> 38:12.369
based on statements
from his friends...

38:12.455 --> 38:14.395
Whoa.

38:14.395 --> 38:16.470
A Beethoven t-shirt.

38:19.425 --> 38:21.425
A call-and-response.

38:21.425 --> 38:24.391
I know who Jesse's partner is.

38:25.483 --> 38:28.395
TakeOver! Wall Street!

38:28.395 --> 38:30.393
<i>Bobby remembered
hearing a Beethoven ringtone</i>

38:30.394 --> 38:31.418
<i>coming from nearby</i>

38:31.419 --> 38:32.466
just before
he stole the backpack.

38:32.467 --> 38:34.399
<i>And West Side Wally said</i>

38:34.399 --> 38:36.479
<i>Beethoven showed up, conducting
his "Fifth Symphony."</i>

38:36.480 --> 38:38.440
We're good to go.

38:38.441 --> 38:40.412
That was actually
Jesse Friedman

38:40.412 --> 38:42.397
<i>with his Beethoven t-shirt
and ringtone,</i>

38:42.398 --> 38:43.479
<i>making his
"All Systems Go" call.</i>

38:43.480 --> 38:45.419
We're good to go.

38:45.420 --> 38:47.495
<i>We know he was talking
to someone within 100 feet</i>

38:47.529 --> 38:49.437
<i>and that call lasted
eight seconds.</i>

38:49.457 --> 38:51.387
<i>Long enough
for a call-and-response...</i>

38:51.388 --> 38:54.395
<i>a call-and-response
to the one person who could</i>

38:54.395 --> 38:56.397
<i>broadcast the explosion
live on television</i>

38:56.398 --> 38:58.418
<i>and bring the publicity
that the movement needed.</i>

38:58.419 --> 38:59.483
We're good to go.

38:59.484 --> 39:02.391
Roger that.

39:03.479 --> 39:05.433
Live in...

39:05.433 --> 39:06.475
three...

39:09.462 --> 39:12.424
I'm here at Boylan Plaza
on day 36

39:12.425 --> 39:14.440
of the TakeOver! protest.

39:14.441 --> 39:17.416
Leann West was on the other end
of that phone.

39:17.416 --> 39:18.460
<i>TakeOver! Wall Street!</i>

39:18.461 --> 39:19.479
<i>Roger that.</i>

39:19.480 --> 39:20.699
No, I wasn't.

39:20.773 --> 39:23.356
I wasn't on the phone with anyone.
I was talking to my cameraman.

39:23.440 --> 39:25.437
I already told the FBI
the whole story.

39:25.438 --> 39:27.435
Yeah, except you
left out a few details.

39:27.436 --> 39:29.195
Like the fact that
you knew Jesse Friedman.

39:29.269 --> 39:31.338
The two of you
went to Hudson University.

39:31.339 --> 39:33.330
Yeah, so did a lot of people.

39:33.331 --> 39:36.314
We're guessing the two of you
reunited at the protest.

39:36.314 --> 39:38.293
You went out for drinks
and you hatched a plan.

39:38.294 --> 39:40.343
He wanted media attention
for the movement.

39:40.343 --> 39:42.300
You wanted to get promoted
to the anchor desk.

39:42.319 --> 39:44.217
So you set up your cameras
at the perfect vantage point.

39:44.294 --> 39:47.335
You waited until you went live
and you detonated that bomb.

39:47.336 --> 39:49.271
What?

39:49.272 --> 39:51.310
That is insane.

39:51.310 --> 39:52.350
This is ridiculous,

39:52.351 --> 39:54.287
and I will not listen
to another word of it.

39:54.288 --> 39:55.298
We're done here.

39:55.299 --> 39:57.321
Do you recognize that?

39:57.322 --> 39:59.660
That's the burner cell
that you used to call Jesse.

39:59.692 --> 40:01.993
Found it in a storm drain about
two blocks from Boylan Plaza.

40:02.061 --> 40:04.122
You know what else
we found in there?

40:06.453 --> 40:08.439
The remote you used
to detonate the bomb.

40:08.667 --> 40:10.449
Small enough to hide
in the palm of your hand.

40:10.481 --> 40:12.076
It's got your fingerprints
all over it, Leann.

40:12.145 --> 40:13.060
How did you find that?

40:13.130 --> 40:16.218
By tracking your movements after the
explosion using your phone's GPS.

40:19.646 --> 40:21.726
No one was supposed
to get hurt.

40:21.726 --> 40:23.669
It was just gonna make
a lot of noise,

40:23.670 --> 40:25.671
and people would start
respecting me as a reporter,

40:25.672 --> 40:27.663
but everything just went wrong.

40:27.663 --> 40:29.709
Why didn't you come forward once
you realized what you had done?

40:29.710 --> 40:32.680
I thought about it,
but what good would that do?

40:32.680 --> 40:35.646
I kept quiet for Jesse.

40:36.700 --> 40:39.650
I wanted to protect his memory.

40:40.713 --> 40:42.709
Well, that's what
your friend Jesse would call

40:42.710 --> 40:45.463
sinning by silence.

40:45.492 --> 40:46.563
It's not smart.

40:46.564 --> 40:49.475
It's not brave.

40:49.475 --> 40:50.546
It's just cowardly.

40:56.509 --> 41:00.478
The FBI has taken
Leann West into custody.

41:00.479 --> 41:02.512
This woman,
whose blind ambition

41:02.513 --> 41:04.516
led to the death
of five people,

41:04.517 --> 41:07.504
will get what she deserves.

41:07.505 --> 41:09.516
I, um...

41:09.517 --> 41:13.542
I want to thank each of you for
what you did to make this happen.

41:13.543 --> 41:15.545
You, uh...

41:15.546 --> 41:19.491
<i>All </i> put in 110%,

41:19.492 --> 41:21.479
made me proud.

41:21.479 --> 41:22.509
So let's, uh...

41:22.510 --> 41:26.563
Get outta here, head on home, and
catch up on some much-needed rest.

41:31.505 --> 41:33.549
You know what?
I'm still kind of wired.

41:33.550 --> 41:36.478
Do you guys want
to go out for a drink?

41:36.479 --> 41:37.542
Oh, I'm sorry.

41:37.542 --> 41:39.521
You know, it feels like a month
since I've seen Jenny.

41:39.522 --> 41:41.487
- I should really get home.
- Me, too.

41:41.488 --> 41:43.471
I'm tanked.
I'll holler at you.

41:44.509 --> 41:47.487
So I guess it's just us.

41:47.488 --> 41:49.474
Yeah.

41:49.475 --> 41:52.500
You know, now that
the case is done...

41:52.500 --> 41:55.467
What did you want
to talk about?

41:59.471 --> 42:00.487
Nothing.

42:00.488 --> 42:02.549
Nothing important anyway.

42:02.550 --> 42:04.563
I'm gonna head home.

42:04.563 --> 42:06.484
Night.

42:07.559 --> 42:09.521
Good night.

42:09.546 --> 42:34.731
