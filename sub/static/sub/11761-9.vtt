<i>Previously on</i> Camelot...

00:02.120 --> 00:05.518
Do you really think that the
king will not wonder where I am?

00:06.011 --> 00:07.878
Are you sure
this is what you want?

00:07.946 --> 00:10.114
You said I'd been
given the gift for a reason.

00:10.182 --> 00:13.809
Now I know what it is.

00:13.877 --> 00:17.269
- It's good to be home.
- Yes. It is.

00:17.337 --> 00:22.029
You are a good man, Leontes,
with a big enough heart to forgive.

00:22.096 --> 00:25.523
- What do I have to forgive?
- Arthur and Guinevere--

00:25.590 --> 00:29.311
what happened between them
on your wedding day.

00:29.379 --> 00:31.174
I could be more open.

00:31.242 --> 00:33.374
You can always practice
with me.

00:33.442 --> 00:35.540
I have nothing
to hide.

00:35.607 --> 00:37.035
You are to recruit some men.

00:37.102 --> 00:40.433
You will attack the outpost
at Barden Pass.

00:40.501 --> 00:42.397
This will draw out the king.

00:42.465 --> 00:46.193
I am the king's mother!
Do you understand what will happen

00:46.261 --> 00:49.090
when he finds out
what's been done to me?

02:24.704 --> 02:26.204
Good morning.

02:31.209 --> 02:33.809
Have I gone mad?

02:33.877 --> 02:36.277
Have I gone mad?

02:36.345 --> 02:39.212
It can't be there.

03:00.590 --> 03:04.325
What are you?

03:04.392 --> 03:06.292
I'm you.

03:06.360 --> 03:09.128
You can't be me.

03:09.195 --> 03:11.262
You can't be me.

03:13.398 --> 03:14.864
I'm your soul.

03:14.932 --> 03:18.000
Your dirty,
damaged soul.

03:18.068 --> 03:20.035
You know what you are.

03:20.103 --> 03:21.770
What you've done.

03:21.838 --> 03:24.938
No. No!

04:08.401 --> 04:11.537
Good lad! We'll make
a Camelot warrior of you yet.

04:11.604 --> 04:13.272
Go fetch it.

04:15.175 --> 04:17.709
- Morning.
- Hello, Albion.

04:17.778 --> 04:19.678
Good lad.
Aye.

04:24.751 --> 04:27.019
Good morning.

04:32.024 --> 04:33.558
Come on.

04:33.626 --> 04:35.860
Here you go.

04:39.197 --> 04:41.198
Come on.

04:43.134 --> 04:45.402
A bit more courtesy,

04:45.470 --> 04:48.439
eh, lads? This is Bardon Pass.
From here on,

04:48.507 --> 04:52.376
you're under King Arthur's protection.
You can rest your horses, get water--

04:55.447 --> 04:57.481
This pass is closed.

05:03.322 --> 05:05.623
Let him go.
Father!

05:09.994 --> 05:11.895
Father! Father!

05:11.962 --> 05:13.963
You think that's enough time
on target practice?

05:14.031 --> 05:17.132
At the gate, the guards,
they've been killed!

05:17.200 --> 05:19.868
- Ready yourselves!
- Ten attackers.

05:22.538 --> 05:25.941
Albion, take the horse
in the back barn.

05:26.009 --> 05:28.643
You know what to do.
Move fast.

05:28.711 --> 05:31.012
- Yes, Father.
- God go with you.

05:39.755 --> 05:43.024
Willem!
Willem, over here!

05:43.092 --> 05:45.226
Yah!

05:45.294 --> 05:47.596
Shall I send a man
to dispatch him?

05:47.663 --> 05:50.298
No.
Get everyone in position.

05:50.366 --> 05:52.867
That boy's doing
exactly what they want.

05:52.935 --> 05:55.937
Heh! All right, boys,
follow us!

05:56.004 --> 05:57.523
Now, Wallace, let's see

05:57.548 --> 05:59.319
what type of men you've
recruited for me.

06:15.258 --> 06:17.961
I'm not mad.
I'm not mad. I'm not mad.

06:18.029 --> 06:20.197
I'm not mad.
I'm not mad.

06:20.265 --> 06:24.535
I'm not mad. Please, God.
Please, God.

06:24.602 --> 06:27.271
I'm not mad.
I'm not mad.

06:30.841 --> 06:33.177
- Where have you been?
- Ah!

06:33.244 --> 06:35.679
Merlin!
What's happened to you?

06:35.746 --> 06:37.781
Wh-wh-what are you doing
in here?

06:37.848 --> 06:40.784
What happened
to your face?

06:40.851 --> 06:43.319
I saw myself.

06:43.387 --> 06:47.324
I was staring
right back at me.

06:47.392 --> 06:49.426
What are you talking about?

06:49.494 --> 06:51.128
Igraine. Igraine.

06:51.195 --> 06:53.097
Where have you been?

06:53.164 --> 06:57.301
Castle Pendragon.
The nun, she, she locked me up

06:57.368 --> 07:00.771
in a room, and...
held me prisoner, and...

07:00.839 --> 07:03.841
No one came!
Shhhh.

07:03.908 --> 07:07.578
Igraine.
Igraine.

07:07.645 --> 07:10.314
You were here
last night.

07:13.786 --> 07:15.220
We were together.

07:15.287 --> 07:17.789
No...

07:17.857 --> 07:22.060
No.
No, I killed a guard.

07:22.127 --> 07:24.629
I stole a horse,
and then when I came back,

07:24.697 --> 07:27.866
I was standing
in the Great Hall, and...

07:29.769 --> 07:35.307
...and I knew what I'd done.
No, no. No...

07:35.375 --> 07:38.210
I should have seen.

07:38.278 --> 07:40.346
I should have known.

07:49.222 --> 07:51.723
You and... me? I...

07:51.791 --> 07:55.427
- So I thought.
- But I...

07:55.494 --> 07:56.895
I don't remember.

07:56.963 --> 08:00.832
I don't... Merlin,
have I lost my mind?

08:00.900 --> 08:02.868
No, you're not
losing your mind.

08:02.935 --> 08:04.191
- Merlin, I--
- It's Morgan!

08:04.985 --> 08:06.385
That's why she held you captive.

08:06.405 --> 08:09.774
She's been here...

08:09.842 --> 08:13.078
...wearing your face.
Igraine,

08:13.146 --> 08:15.114
I know you've been
through hell,

08:15.181 --> 08:18.484
but we have to find out what else
she did while she was here.

08:20.987 --> 08:23.556
Open up!
It's Morgan!

08:27.127 --> 08:29.195
Igraine escaped.
She killed a guard.

08:29.263 --> 08:31.364
She'll be on her way
back to Camelot as we speak.

08:31.432 --> 08:34.934
- I know; I saw her.
- Did she see you?

08:35.003 --> 08:36.937
She only saw herself.

08:37.005 --> 08:38.940
Poor woman.

08:39.006 --> 08:41.442
Everybody will think
she's gone completely mad.

08:41.510 --> 08:44.746
Well, madness so often
afflicts the weak-minded.

08:58.526 --> 09:01.261
What's wrong?

09:01.329 --> 09:05.266
Did something happen
between you and the king?

09:05.333 --> 09:07.435
Oh, don't be ridiculous.

09:13.176 --> 09:15.812
Then swear.

09:15.879 --> 09:20.183
Swear on the holy word of God
that nothing happened.

09:20.251 --> 09:24.320
Of course
nothing happened.

09:24.388 --> 09:27.357
Then swear.

09:34.931 --> 09:36.998
Fine.

09:43.172 --> 09:46.774
I swear...

09:46.842 --> 09:50.479
...that...

09:50.546 --> 09:54.450
...I never...

09:57.454 --> 09:59.488
...that nothing...

10:04.361 --> 10:07.964
It wasn't anything.
There was nothing.

10:12.936 --> 10:14.670
What was nothing?

10:14.738 --> 10:17.405
Tell me.

10:17.473 --> 10:19.073
Guinevere, tell me.

10:19.141 --> 10:23.477
It was
before we were married.

10:23.545 --> 10:26.180
It was only once.

10:26.247 --> 10:29.117
I never wanted you
to know.

10:29.184 --> 10:32.587
Oh, God, please don't look at me
like that. I can't bare it!
No.

10:36.559 --> 10:38.293
When?

10:41.097 --> 10:44.899
Before I was your wife.

10:44.967 --> 10:48.069
But now we're married,
and, and I'm loyal to you.

10:48.137 --> 10:50.673
If you have any feelings
for me, tell me when.

11:00.384 --> 11:02.152
On our wedding day.

11:06.356 --> 11:08.925
I'm sorry.

11:08.993 --> 11:12.128
I did a terrible thing,
but I'm still your wife.

11:12.196 --> 11:14.063
You're not my wife;

11:14.131 --> 11:16.198
you're the king's whore.

11:26.376 --> 11:28.277
Hit me back!

11:28.344 --> 11:30.379
Hit me back!

11:30.447 --> 11:33.282
Hit me back!

11:47.031 --> 11:50.967
- Out of my way, Merlin.
- Leontes...

11:51.035 --> 11:53.870
What's happened?
My business is with the king.

11:53.938 --> 11:58.107
The king's business is mine
also. Come here. Tell me.

12:02.179 --> 12:04.380
The Lady Igraine,
she told me the truth.

12:04.448 --> 12:05.648
What?

12:08.185 --> 12:10.720
Arthur took my wife.

12:10.788 --> 12:12.689
He had... my wife.

12:14.992 --> 12:16.426
No.

12:16.493 --> 12:18.361
I can't believe this.

12:18.429 --> 12:20.797
- She confessed to me!!
- Shh!

12:20.865 --> 12:23.266
The king has to answer
for what he's done.

12:23.334 --> 12:25.669
If this is true,
what Arthur has done

12:25.736 --> 12:27.437
is unforgivable.

12:27.505 --> 12:31.575
But what are you going to do?
You're going to beat him?

12:31.642 --> 12:34.745
Slit his throat?

12:34.813 --> 12:36.346
Leontes,

12:36.414 --> 12:38.515
you can bear this cross.

12:38.583 --> 12:41.686
I know you can.
Why should I?

12:45.223 --> 12:49.794
Go back to Guinevere.
Let her absolve herself.

12:49.862 --> 12:52.998
I'll deal with the king.

12:53.066 --> 12:55.768
What of your
undertaking?

12:55.835 --> 12:58.271
- It worked.
- Are you sure?

12:58.338 --> 13:01.541
Camelot is diseased.
We will watch the plague spread.

13:01.609 --> 13:03.543
And the work
at Bardon Pass has begun.

13:03.610 --> 13:06.679
- Other strikes must follow.
- It is in motion.

13:06.747 --> 13:08.814
The men are here.

13:13.052 --> 13:16.287
My Lady Morgan is most anxious
to see you.

13:16.355 --> 13:18.289
So are we to see her.

13:18.357 --> 13:21.358
King Arthur's done nothing
for me. It's you I owe right now

13:21.426 --> 13:24.094
for the food in my belly,
and the roof over my head.

13:24.162 --> 13:27.098
I'm asking you to help me
to claim back our land.

13:27.166 --> 13:29.234
You want to make a strike
on Camelot?

13:29.301 --> 13:33.872
That will be treason.

13:33.940 --> 13:36.575
We seek only
to illuminate the truth.

13:36.643 --> 13:40.079
Arthur's pledge of protection
to his people is a lie.

13:40.147 --> 13:43.249
Even now his western border
at Bardon Pass is under attack.

13:43.317 --> 13:46.385
Should there be similar attacks
on Pendragon outposts,

13:46.453 --> 13:48.453
in the north, south,
and east,

13:48.521 --> 13:52.457
people would understand how
fragile their security really is.

13:52.524 --> 13:56.093
I will take anything down,
so long as there's payment.

13:56.161 --> 13:58.762
Anyone can buy a man
and his sword.

13:58.830 --> 14:02.065
If this is done well,
the only safe place

14:02.133 --> 14:04.334
in the kingdom will be
under my protection.

14:04.402 --> 14:07.938
The crown will fall to me,
and when it does,

14:08.005 --> 14:10.907
I will need champions
and a marshal--

14:10.975 --> 14:13.595
men whose investment
in my rule is greater

14:13.620 --> 14:15.020
than the gold in their purses.

14:15.046 --> 14:18.683
Men who have pledged themselves
to me,

14:18.751 --> 14:21.219
mind, body,

14:21.287 --> 14:23.322
and soul.

14:27.326 --> 14:29.794
You have my pledge.

14:40.337 --> 14:42.271
What's the matter?

14:44.675 --> 14:47.310
Leontes knows. About us,
about the wedding day.

14:47.378 --> 14:49.279
He knows everything!
What do you mean?

14:49.346 --> 14:50.587
How does he know?

14:50.612 --> 14:51.978
- I told him.
- What?!

14:52.350 --> 14:54.784
It's like
he already knew!

14:54.852 --> 14:56.787
Did you say something?

14:56.855 --> 14:58.956
I never said anything
to anyone!

14:59.023 --> 15:01.492
Then how
did he already know?

15:04.229 --> 15:06.430
Where is he?

15:11.135 --> 15:13.536
- You'll only make it worse.
- I have to try

15:13.604 --> 15:15.539
and explain
to him.

15:15.606 --> 15:17.708
What could you
possibly say?

15:19.678 --> 15:22.713
That it wasn't your doing;
I pressured you.

15:22.781 --> 15:24.748
That's not true.

15:24.816 --> 15:26.750
I can't avoid him.

15:26.818 --> 15:30.286
He's my friend, my champion.

15:32.255 --> 15:34.389
Why did we ever do it?

15:36.359 --> 15:37.960
Leontes is a good man.

15:38.027 --> 15:40.061
It'll be all right.

15:40.129 --> 15:43.031
It won't.

15:52.809 --> 15:54.832
- What's she doing?
- She's practicing.

15:54.833 --> 15:55.843
Practicing what?

15:55.846 --> 15:58.581
- Self control.
- How will that help us?

15:58.649 --> 16:03.487
We kidnapped the king's mother.
Your fear is useless to Morgan.

16:03.555 --> 16:06.090
Giver her your faith
or nothing at all.

16:06.158 --> 16:08.125
But surely there will be
retribution.

16:08.193 --> 16:11.095
There will be,
and we must stand firm.

16:11.163 --> 16:14.299
The king's mother has
gone mad.

16:14.366 --> 16:17.269
Merlin is acting alone.

16:17.337 --> 16:19.872
Understand?

16:23.610 --> 16:26.818
You see the king, you tell him
to come and find me.

16:26.843 --> 16:28.043
No one is to speak to him

16:28.047 --> 16:30.916
before I do. Understand?
Right.

16:32.852 --> 16:34.463
I knew that they had eyes
for each other,

16:34.488 --> 16:36.188
but I had no idea
it had got to this.

16:36.189 --> 16:37.623
But Morgan did.

16:37.690 --> 16:39.992
I need your help
to put this right.

16:40.059 --> 16:43.896
People here rely on you,
confide in you.

16:43.963 --> 16:46.898
They look to you
as their guide.

16:46.966 --> 16:48.767
Well, what can I do?

16:48.835 --> 16:51.469
The men must never find out
about this.

16:51.537 --> 16:53.271
They'll all feel betrayed.

16:53.339 --> 16:56.607
Keep Guinevere under control
and quiet.

16:58.778 --> 17:00.712
What about Morgan?

17:00.779 --> 17:02.648
Oh, I'll get to her.

17:02.715 --> 17:04.648
I have to find Arthur first.

17:04.717 --> 17:07.819
All I've worked for, and it's
people who get in the way again.

17:07.887 --> 17:09.422
Always people.

17:09.446 --> 17:10.847
I need
to speak to the king.

17:10.890 --> 17:12.614
- What's the trouble here?
- My family need his help.

17:12.638 --> 17:13.939
The king can't see you now.

17:13.960 --> 17:15.624
I need to speak to him!

17:15.648 --> 17:17.249
Wait your turn like
everyone else.

17:22.367 --> 17:25.270
Camelot is
in its death throes.

17:25.338 --> 17:28.040
Once its lies are exposed,

17:28.108 --> 17:30.542
it will quickly decay,

17:30.610 --> 17:34.180
and people will look around
in fear and panic.

17:34.247 --> 17:37.884
And I will be there
to pick them up.

17:37.952 --> 17:40.053
They will need me.

17:47.563 --> 17:52.067
Men claim to be superior,
but it's them

17:52.135 --> 17:55.271
more than women
who are ruled by their passions.

17:55.339 --> 17:58.641
Women endure
what men cannot bear.

17:58.709 --> 18:01.178
Which is why
people need a strong queen.

18:01.245 --> 18:03.981
Mmm...

18:04.049 --> 18:06.584
Bring me
the gilded dress.

18:06.652 --> 18:09.020
Expecting
an official visit?

18:09.088 --> 18:13.359
Invite our friends.
I'll need an audience.

18:37.517 --> 18:40.619
I know how much
I've hurt you.

18:43.389 --> 18:45.423
I'm so ashamed.

18:52.866 --> 18:54.666
Hold me.

18:58.371 --> 19:00.405
Make love to me.

19:02.875 --> 19:06.111
Is this
how you kissed him?

19:06.179 --> 19:08.614
Once, you said.

19:08.682 --> 19:10.984
How do I know
you're telling me the truth?

19:11.051 --> 19:12.210
It happened again
on the journey

19:12.235 --> 19:13.353
you took when your father died,
didn't it?

19:13.354 --> 19:15.288
No, no, no, no.
I swear on my honour--

19:15.356 --> 19:18.124
You gave your honour...

19:18.192 --> 19:19.959
...to Arthur.

19:20.027 --> 19:21.661
I know

19:21.729 --> 19:24.364
what I did was wrong.

19:24.432 --> 19:27.468
I'm just asking you
to forgive me.

19:29.838 --> 19:32.006
And I want to,
but I don't know how to.

19:32.074 --> 19:34.743
I don't deserve you.

19:44.654 --> 19:47.289
What made you ask me
this morning?

19:49.225 --> 19:51.893
It was something
Igraine said.

19:54.229 --> 19:56.497
Igraine...

19:56.565 --> 19:59.833
What did she say?

19:59.901 --> 20:02.202
If I hadn't have asked you,
would you have told me?

20:04.505 --> 20:07.607
I'd rather lie,

20:07.675 --> 20:11.010
and live with my guilt

20:11.078 --> 20:13.112
than ever hurt you.

20:17.950 --> 20:20.985
And I would rather you do
anything than lie to me.

20:34.999 --> 20:36.666
You should have told me.

20:36.734 --> 20:39.669
I swore I'd never betray her
or anyone else.

20:39.736 --> 20:41.509
So you're not even
gonna try and deny it.

20:41.534 --> 20:43.134
No. It's the truth.

20:43.173 --> 20:46.542
Never admit that to anyon
else here. Understand?

20:46.543 --> 20:49.178
It's not that easy.
I've hurt people I care about.

20:49.246 --> 20:51.647
Those people don't matter!
You're a king.

20:51.715 --> 20:56.319
Your responsibility is
to your realm! Nothing more.

20:56.386 --> 20:58.421
So what do you suggest
I do?

21:02.359 --> 21:04.093
Cover this up,

21:04.161 --> 21:06.963
or risk losing everything.

21:07.030 --> 21:09.547
I must speak to the king!

21:09.548 --> 21:10.934
Who the hell are you?

21:10.935 --> 21:14.103
- Your Majesty, please!
- What do you want?

21:14.104 --> 21:16.505
My family is under siege
at Bardon Pass.

21:24.147 --> 21:26.415
What's your name?

21:26.483 --> 21:29.351
Albion, Majesty.

21:29.419 --> 21:32.054
My father,
he sent me to tell you

21:32.122 --> 21:34.256
that men are attacking
Bardon Pass.

21:34.324 --> 21:38.594
The Bardon Pass has
to be defended.

21:38.662 --> 21:41.664
I want the men
assembled now.

21:41.731 --> 21:44.633
Bardon Pass is the main
trade route into Camelot.

21:44.701 --> 21:48.337
If we lose that, word wil
spread of our weakness,

21:48.405 --> 21:50.572
and all our land could come
under threat.

21:50.640 --> 21:53.208
We protect the family
and our territory.

21:53.276 --> 21:54.809
Nothing less is acceptable.

21:56.745 --> 21:59.381
Where's Leontes?

22:03.519 --> 22:05.819
Bardon Pass is
under attack.

22:05.887 --> 22:07.621
Your men need you.

22:07.689 --> 22:09.923
I'm going home
to my village.

22:09.990 --> 22:13.492
This is your home.
We are your family.

22:13.560 --> 22:16.928
Fulfil your oath
to your king,

22:16.996 --> 22:19.764
or your honour counts
for nothing.

22:19.832 --> 22:21.866
You talk to the king
of honour.

22:21.934 --> 22:23.868
He fucked my bride.

22:23.936 --> 22:27.039
And Arthur will be held
to account when this is over.

22:27.106 --> 22:29.908
But right now
we have a crisis on our hands,

22:29.976 --> 22:33.012
and you have a duty
to your men.

22:35.515 --> 22:37.217
When I return,

22:37.285 --> 22:39.352
I'm done with Camelot.

22:41.322 --> 22:45.960
That's for you
and your wife to decide.

22:46.028 --> 22:49.029
Guinevere!
Leave the men be!

22:49.097 --> 22:50.764
What makes you think I'm ever
going to listen to you again?

22:50.832 --> 22:53.767
I told you to stay away from him,
but you didn't listen to me.

22:53.834 --> 22:56.270
So you tell Leontes
I betrayed him?

22:56.337 --> 22:59.239
- No, I didn't say anything.
- You are the only one who knew.

22:59.307 --> 23:01.475
Guinevere, please,

23:01.543 --> 23:03.544
there are things that have
gone on here that are far,

23:03.612 --> 23:05.979
far more wicked than anything
that you have done.

23:06.047 --> 23:08.682
In time I will explain.

23:12.186 --> 23:14.321
Leontes forgot
his prayer book.

23:14.388 --> 23:16.389
He never goes to battle
without it.

23:16.457 --> 23:18.324
Do you really think

23:18.392 --> 23:20.493
that he wants
to see you now?

23:24.698 --> 23:27.099
It was once.

23:27.167 --> 23:28.801
Only once.

23:39.346 --> 23:40.813
No hurry, Leontes.

23:40.881 --> 23:42.649
We're all only waiting for you.

23:46.788 --> 23:48.989
Gawain...

23:49.057 --> 23:51.384
Never let the king
out of your sight.

23:51.409 --> 23:53.509
If Leontes moves
to hurt Arthur,

23:53.529 --> 23:55.864
step in.
Leontes?

23:55.932 --> 23:58.100
Don't question me.
Not now.

23:58.168 --> 24:01.237
If he or anyone else makes
to harm the king,

24:01.305 --> 24:04.040
do what you have to do.

24:04.108 --> 24:08.778
Now, smile,
like I've taught you a joke.

24:08.845 --> 24:10.346
All right, let's move!

24:13.651 --> 24:15.719
Be victorious!

24:15.787 --> 24:18.388
For Camelot!
For Camelot!

24:18.456 --> 24:20.591
For Camelot!

24:24.963 --> 24:27.698
The trade routes are now
completely unsafe!

24:27.766 --> 24:29.767
The banner of the king means
nothing!

24:29.834 --> 24:31.235
Gentlemen, please!

24:31.302 --> 24:32.770
Please.

24:32.837 --> 24:35.105
We must have faith
in my brother.

24:35.173 --> 24:37.808
Faith is no substitute
for real confidence!

24:37.876 --> 24:40.077
I will not heed disloyalty
against Arthur.

24:40.145 --> 24:42.113
It's not his fault if there are
rogue elements within his court

24:42.180 --> 24:43.796
that are difficult
for him to control.

24:43.821 --> 24:45.449
What rogue elements?

24:50.322 --> 24:54.291
His sorcerer is rumoured
to have a great deal of influence.

24:54.359 --> 24:57.561
He's been known to act...
rashly at times.

24:57.629 --> 24:59.563
Independent
of the king's wishes?

24:59.631 --> 25:03.101
- Some say that's he's mad.
- What, for power?

25:03.168 --> 25:04.769
However mad he is,

25:04.837 --> 25:07.306
our king will keep him
in check.

25:07.373 --> 25:10.109
Where are you going?

25:10.177 --> 25:12.445
You're going to Castle
Pendragon, aren't you?

25:12.512 --> 25:14.914
- You're not coming.
- I want to see her punished.

25:14.982 --> 25:16.917
I should never
have let her get close.

25:16.985 --> 25:20.220
But you didn't, did you?
You let me get close.

25:20.288 --> 25:24.458
If that's what you were
thinking, I'm glad.

25:24.526 --> 25:26.994
I'm just sorry
I wasn't really there.

25:29.931 --> 25:32.499
So am I.

25:32.566 --> 25:34.634
We'll go
to Castle Pendragon,

25:34.701 --> 25:37.169
bring her back--
drag her back if we have to-

25:37.237 --> 25:39.404
before the king
to answer for her treason.

25:39.472 --> 25:43.575
Morgan must submit
to the authority of Camelot.

25:47.013 --> 25:48.580
Yah.

25:50.851 --> 25:52.784
There they are.

25:52.852 --> 25:56.756
We're vastly
outnumbered.

25:56.824 --> 25:58.765
Arthur, we'll be far too

25:58.790 --> 26:00.510
exposed if we approach
from the front.

26:01.596 --> 26:03.864
You said
there was another way?

26:03.932 --> 26:07.535
We'll have
to leave the horses here.

26:28.127 --> 26:32.363
It's just up there.
Right. Get across me. Go.

26:32.431 --> 26:34.132
Leontes.

26:36.034 --> 26:38.703
It's fine.
Come past me.

26:38.770 --> 26:41.238
Set, Leontes?
Push.

26:45.610 --> 26:46.944
We're the help, son!

26:46.969 --> 26:48.769
- Griffith, it's us!
- Albion!

26:48.780 --> 26:51.439
You got them!
Give us a hand.

26:56.120 --> 26:58.187
Come on, old man.

27:02.559 --> 27:04.760
Ah! Ah!

27:19.411 --> 27:20.844
Is that him?

27:20.912 --> 27:23.147
- I'm Arthur.
- Come. See my father.

27:23.215 --> 27:26.483
Albion! Ah, you did it!
Good lad!

27:26.551 --> 27:28.819
They've been gathering
since morning.

27:30.039 --> 27:31.186
Thank you for coming,
Your Highness.

27:31.187 --> 27:33.116
- You must be Lucan.
- Yes.

27:33.190 --> 27:35.324
First things first:
our colours.

27:35.392 --> 27:36.959
Come.

27:41.898 --> 27:44.799
So they came,
exactly as Morgan predicted.

27:46.702 --> 27:48.136
She knows her family well.

27:48.204 --> 27:50.705
She swore her brother wouldn't
ignore a lost cause.

27:50.773 --> 27:52.707
There he is.

27:52.775 --> 27:56.111
- We outnumber them 4 to 1.
- Don't underestimate them.

27:56.178 --> 27:59.114
Morgan says
they're highly trained.

27:59.182 --> 28:02.150
- Then we'll keep them locked in.
- Perfect.

28:02.218 --> 28:04.319
A king
to the slaughter.

28:04.387 --> 28:07.523
This is my way
to Morgan.

28:07.590 --> 28:09.992
I'll deliver her
the king's sword.

28:10.059 --> 28:14.229
She'll be on her knees to me
in gratitude.

28:14.297 --> 28:16.400
We've been waiting
for them to attack.

28:17.470 --> 28:18.927
Well, they have the numbers,

28:18.935 --> 28:21.170
but we have the tower;
it's a good vantage point.

28:21.238 --> 28:23.973
Archers up there might help us.
Until we've run out of arrows.

28:24.041 --> 28:25.842
We'll secure your home
before that happens.

28:25.910 --> 28:29.012
I'll check the layout;
see if there are any weaknesses.

28:39.659 --> 28:41.793
Who are
all these people?

28:41.861 --> 28:44.563
There are attacks going on
throughout the realm.

28:44.631 --> 28:46.965
The undefended are
flocking here.

28:47.033 --> 28:49.468
For protection.
Where is she?

28:49.535 --> 28:52.304
Lady Morgan is consumed
with her task.

28:52.371 --> 28:55.239
She's unavailable.
Not to me, she isn't.

28:55.307 --> 28:56.974
MORGAN!

28:57.042 --> 28:58.709
WHERE ARE YOU?

28:58.777 --> 29:03.012
HIDING IN THE DARK LIKE
THE POISONOUS SNAKE YOU ARE?

29:06.350 --> 29:08.451
Calm down, sorcerer.

29:08.519 --> 29:10.453
Why have you come here?

29:10.521 --> 29:12.455
Witchcraft.

29:12.523 --> 29:14.290
Abduction.

29:14.358 --> 29:16.359
Treason!

29:16.427 --> 29:19.362
How do you answer
to these charges?

29:19.430 --> 29:21.398
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

29:21.465 --> 29:25.202
So you deny using magic
to assume another's shape?

29:25.269 --> 29:29.273
You of all people dare hurl
such accusations at me?

29:29.341 --> 29:31.442
You abducted Igraine,

29:31.510 --> 29:35.046
had her beaten,
and walked through Camelot

29:35.114 --> 29:37.915
wearing her face.

29:41.186 --> 29:43.187
That's not true.

29:43.255 --> 29:46.957
Morgan is the only one
we can trust right now!

29:47.025 --> 29:50.027
Ha! Ha! What is this?
Hmm? Your chorus of fools?

29:50.095 --> 29:52.630
They are the good people
of the realm.

29:52.698 --> 29:56.267
She tied me up!
Held me prisoner!

29:56.335 --> 29:57.802
Tormented me!

29:57.870 --> 30:01.406
- Poor woman is clearly deluded.
- I remember the room.

30:01.473 --> 30:05.210
There were markings--
witches' markings!

30:05.278 --> 30:09.047
There is
no such room here.

30:09.114 --> 30:11.015
It's here.

30:27.033 --> 30:28.967
It was in here.

30:29.035 --> 30:32.537
I swear it was.
This is a place

30:32.605 --> 30:34.739
of peace and prayer.

30:34.807 --> 30:38.444
There are markings
under here.

30:40.714 --> 30:42.715
We have nothing
to hide.

30:42.783 --> 30:46.852
There was a guard
named Donal.

30:49.789 --> 30:52.624
He was in here
with me.

30:52.692 --> 30:55.427
Then what happened to him?

30:55.495 --> 30:59.598
You must have so many heavy sins
on your conscience, child.

30:59.666 --> 31:02.968
Is there nothing
you need to confess?

31:07.874 --> 31:10.441
She is trying to convince them
that we're mad.

31:12.912 --> 31:16.648
But I know what happened in here.
Is she often like this?

31:16.715 --> 31:20.352
There was a boy named Redwald.
He was an innocent in all this.

31:20.420 --> 31:23.856
Now he's dead.
Why are you telling me?

31:23.924 --> 31:27.293
I know
you're a part of this.

31:27.361 --> 31:30.930
You will answer
to the king.

31:38.039 --> 31:40.441
I look forward to that.

31:50.920 --> 31:53.622
Come on. Pull.

31:53.689 --> 31:56.992
Pull.

32:01.096 --> 32:04.332
Right there.
Right there.

32:04.400 --> 32:07.268
Leontes.

32:07.336 --> 32:10.038
Don't blame her.

32:10.105 --> 32:11.672
It was all me.

32:16.611 --> 32:18.979
I am arresting you.

32:19.047 --> 32:23.149
And you will stand charges
of treason at court.

32:23.216 --> 32:25.618
You can't arrest her.
She's Morgan Pendragon!

32:25.685 --> 32:28.187
I can, and I will,

32:28.255 --> 32:30.656
in the name of the king.
Merlin,

32:30.724 --> 32:34.894
this is completely absurd.
I will take you by force.

32:34.962 --> 32:37.697
Force?
All these people were

32:37.764 --> 32:40.033
promised protection
by Camelot's force.

32:40.100 --> 32:43.135
But where is it now?

32:43.203 --> 32:46.371
Their homes are being attacked,
and you'd turn your force on me

32:46.439 --> 32:48.941
instead of protecting them?
Where is Arthur?

32:49.009 --> 32:50.542
Safe from your reach.

32:50.610 --> 32:53.412
While the entire country
bleeds, you storm in here

32:53.480 --> 32:55.214
with your insane charges.

32:59.553 --> 33:02.755
We won't allow it!
Guards!

33:02.823 --> 33:05.124
Hold them!

33:07.861 --> 33:10.629
The people are with me,
sorcerer.

33:17.070 --> 33:21.140
Tie them up.
Bind their hands securely.

33:21.208 --> 33:22.742
Don't you understand?

33:22.809 --> 33:25.078
The people have lost faith
in the king.

33:25.145 --> 33:26.979
Their homes are under attack.

33:27.047 --> 33:29.248
So they come here
to you and Morgan.

33:29.316 --> 33:31.349
We would never
turn away the needy.

33:31.417 --> 33:34.386
- How very saintly of you.
- Your brought your king

33:34.454 --> 33:36.889
to the throne
with the support of the people.

33:36.956 --> 33:40.492
Now he's lost their support.
Where does that leave you?

33:40.560 --> 33:42.261
Oh, very good.

33:42.329 --> 33:44.463
Play us at our own game.

33:44.530 --> 33:49.133
Who are you?
Why does this even matter to you?

33:49.201 --> 33:52.804
I am a source of solace
to Morgan.

33:52.872 --> 33:54.773
Puppet or puppeteer?

33:54.840 --> 33:58.409
You see, that's what
I can't quite work out.

33:58.477 --> 34:01.045
- They ask the same about you.
- And what is it

34:01.113 --> 34:04.281
you get in return
for doing Morgan's work?

34:04.349 --> 34:06.317
Service is its own reward.

34:06.385 --> 34:09.654
Clever.
I could grow to like you.

34:09.722 --> 34:12.210
Building alliances quietly

34:12.235 --> 34:14.735
while fomenting disquiet
in Camelot.

34:14.760 --> 34:17.027
Her delusions must be
contagious.

34:17.094 --> 34:20.697
Is this it? Do we just
let them hold us hostage?

34:20.766 --> 34:22.033
Yes.

34:22.101 --> 34:24.302
A mighty sorcerer,

34:24.370 --> 34:27.806
constrained...
by a rope.

34:27.873 --> 34:30.108
If this is the will
of the people,

34:30.176 --> 34:34.780
so be it, but you'd better be
confident, little nun,

34:34.848 --> 34:37.649
because I can wait.

34:37.717 --> 34:39.918
I have more patience
than you can ever imagine.

34:39.985 --> 34:41.687
Or perhaps the stories

34:41.755 --> 34:47.626
of your sorcery are
just stories after all.

34:47.694 --> 34:53.033
Camelot isn't built on magic,
but on people, on their faith.

34:53.101 --> 34:57.137
I have this belief
they'll see through your ploys.

35:02.877 --> 35:04.945
Are you all right?

35:05.013 --> 35:07.581
I'm fine.

35:07.649 --> 35:09.250
What's wrong?

35:11.219 --> 35:13.221
Not now, Kay.

35:15.691 --> 35:17.692
It's between me
and the king.

35:17.760 --> 35:20.428
There's a rider coming!

35:20.496 --> 35:24.732
Rider approaching!

35:24.799 --> 35:26.767
What the hell is
going on?

35:26.835 --> 35:30.571
Target the rider!
Arrows!

35:30.638 --> 35:32.872
It's Guinevere!

35:41.781 --> 35:43.782
No. No!

35:47.920 --> 35:49.788
Guinevere!

35:54.594 --> 35:56.728
Arthur!

35:56.796 --> 35:58.297
It's the king!

35:58.364 --> 36:01.266
It's the king!
Target the king!

36:01.334 --> 36:03.285
When I say "now", you run
as best you can.

36:03.310 --> 36:04.510
All right.

36:05.771 --> 36:08.006
Go now!

36:08.073 --> 36:10.776
Go! Move!

36:13.413 --> 36:15.348
Run!
Take her!

36:15.415 --> 36:17.283
Go! Ulfius!

36:17.351 --> 36:19.686
Take her!
Get her out of here!

36:21.589 --> 36:23.857
- What did you do?!
- What do you mean?

36:23.924 --> 36:25.072
What did you do?!

36:25.097 --> 36:27.302
- Hands of the king, Kay!
- I know you! What happened?!

36:27.595 --> 36:29.796
- Kay!
- Leontes.

36:29.863 --> 36:32.631
Tell them!

36:36.870 --> 36:39.838
I betrayed Leontes.

36:39.906 --> 36:41.840
In the worst way
I could have.

36:41.908 --> 36:43.275
No...

36:43.342 --> 36:45.644
It was the morning
of my wedding.

36:45.711 --> 36:48.614
He had her first.
And then he married us.

36:52.686 --> 36:55.321
- Kay--
- Don't talk to me.

37:00.996 --> 37:03.108
Kay!

37:03.109 --> 37:04.541
You just can't
stop yourself, can you?

37:04.566 --> 37:06.200
Any woman is fair game.

37:06.225 --> 37:07.566
It's not like that,
and it never is.

37:07.569 --> 37:09.469
Don't try to find an excuse;
I've heard them all before.

37:09.537 --> 37:11.223
- I love her.
- Of course you do!

37:11.248 --> 37:12.712
Like you loved all the others!

37:12.739 --> 37:15.508
I love her, but she married
someone else, and I accept that.

37:15.575 --> 37:16.905
You accept it?

37:16.930 --> 37:18.602
After you destroyed
Leontes' marriage.

37:18.611 --> 37:22.113
And, what, he's expected,
we're expected, to ignore it?!

37:22.181 --> 37:23.878
'Cause that's what
you're used to

37:23.903 --> 37:25.468
t's what always happens,
ever since we were boys.

37:25.484 --> 37:27.752
- No, this isn't the same.
- It is!

37:27.820 --> 37:29.487
Because you never change!

37:32.292 --> 37:34.026
You're not a worthy king.

37:34.094 --> 37:36.129
You're not even
a worthy brother.

37:37.965 --> 37:41.035
At least
we were never linked by blood.

37:57.318 --> 38:02.455
Again you return, and again
you leave in disgrace.

38:02.523 --> 38:03.780
And you, Merlin,

38:03.805 --> 38:06.538
you should have stayed
in bed where I left you.

38:14.167 --> 38:17.169
They tried to arrest me
and drag me to Camelot!

38:17.236 --> 38:19.471
Well, I will go
to Camelot!

38:19.539 --> 38:21.973
I will expose the corruption
of this sorcerer,

38:22.040 --> 38:25.409
and help the king, my brother,
to restore order.

38:29.314 --> 38:31.749
Let all
who seek a safe harbour

38:31.816 --> 38:34.151
find one with me.

38:41.392 --> 38:43.427
Leontes.

38:46.197 --> 38:48.265
Who did you come here for?

38:51.235 --> 38:52.769
You.

38:54.672 --> 38:56.272
Only you.

38:58.175 --> 39:00.643
Don't ignore me!

39:00.710 --> 39:03.312
This is not over!
How can you be so sure?

39:03.380 --> 39:04.834
Because I made a promise

39:04.859 --> 39:06.682
on our wedding day
in front of God.

39:11.388 --> 39:12.956
You left without it.

39:21.132 --> 39:23.701
Keep it.

39:23.768 --> 39:25.802
But it's yours.

39:28.440 --> 39:29.973
You were mine too.

39:38.349 --> 39:41.018
- Make way.
- Who is it?

39:41.086 --> 39:43.887
The perfect opportunity
to talk to them.

39:43.955 --> 39:46.624
The attacks are working.

39:52.965 --> 39:55.032
Who is it?

40:01.007 --> 40:02.607
Who are all these people?

40:02.675 --> 40:04.810
There's been a series
of attacks at the boundaries.

40:04.878 --> 40:08.380
There are all families from
frontier houses across the realm.

40:08.448 --> 40:10.816
They're heading for Camelot.
They're scared to be at home.

40:14.721 --> 40:18.391
My name is
Morgan Pendragon.

40:18.458 --> 40:20.026
I'm taking 2 conspirators

40:20.093 --> 40:22.261
to Camelot
to face the king's justice.

40:22.329 --> 40:25.998
If you leave with me now,
I can promise you protection.

40:28.034 --> 40:31.738
Let's go.

40:31.806 --> 40:33.874
Go with Morgan.

40:33.941 --> 40:36.343
You have nothing
to fear now.

40:36.410 --> 40:40.815
You will be safe at Camelot.
Come with us. Come with us.

40:46.956 --> 40:51.293
All these people are starting
to believe Morgan over Arthur.

40:51.361 --> 40:54.297
We have to do something.
You have to.

40:54.364 --> 40:57.633
That's the trap.
That's what she wants.

40:57.700 --> 41:00.536
Any hint of sorcery now will
play into her hands

41:00.603 --> 41:02.871
and turn the people
against us for good.

41:02.938 --> 41:05.407
Well, maybe we have
to take that risk

41:05.474 --> 41:07.075
just to stop her.

41:07.143 --> 41:09.345
These people will never
follow us.

41:09.412 --> 41:11.681
We're not the solution
to this.

41:11.749 --> 41:15.352
Then what is?

41:15.420 --> 41:16.609
Only Arthur.

41:16.634 --> 41:18.834
You and I, we're
the sparks that made him.

41:18.890 --> 41:20.487
He has to become the flame now.

41:20.512 --> 41:22.415
He has to prevail by his own
design.

41:24.395 --> 41:25.982
Whatever the provocation,

41:26.007 --> 41:27.974
you and I must stay
strong and silent,

41:28.166 --> 41:32.269
and have faith in your son.
Promise me.

41:32.337 --> 41:35.606
Are you sure
this is the best approach?

41:35.674 --> 41:37.718
This way Arthur will see

41:37.743 --> 41:40.288
his sister's true colours
once and for all.

41:40.478 --> 41:44.681
This will finally break the
misplaced loyalty he feels to her.

41:55.995 --> 41:58.730
- Hurry.
- Look.

42:16.015 --> 42:18.917
I want to talk
to the king.

42:18.984 --> 42:21.853
So talk.

42:21.921 --> 42:23.988
You have one chance
to surrender.

42:24.056 --> 42:27.692
You could have
saved yourself a walk.

42:27.760 --> 42:30.394
You killed my guards!

42:30.462 --> 42:33.464
You threatened
my territory!

42:33.532 --> 42:36.300
Then today you die.

42:36.368 --> 42:38.536
Fuck you!

42:38.604 --> 42:41.006
Gawain, hold.

42:55.356 --> 42:57.724
Prepare for the attack.

43:01.296 --> 43:04.065
Come on!
You heard him!

43:06.001 --> 43:09.235
♪

43:22.815 --> 43:26.350
♪

44:01.853 --> 44:04.087
Attack!

44:45.330 --> 44:48.966
Ulfius,
get her out of her!

44:58.144 --> 45:02.015
Kay!

45:07.222 --> 45:09.823
Albion! Get inside!

45:10.602 --> 45:12.900
- Mother! Mother!
- Get your father.

45:22.103 --> 45:24.004
Arthur!

45:27.076 --> 45:30.378
You have to sound a retreat.
We've lost too many men!

45:30.446 --> 45:32.847
What the hell is this mess?
I told you to find the best men!

45:32.915 --> 45:34.810
I did!

45:34.835 --> 45:37.285
But those men are clever,
and they're well trained!

45:37.286 --> 45:39.487
Mother,
we'll help you.

45:46.361 --> 45:47.962
Ulfius!

45:51.232 --> 45:53.634
Fall back!

45:55.269 --> 45:57.571
- Bring a hand!
- Hurry!

45:57.638 --> 45:59.805
Come on, help me!

46:00.707 --> 46:03.075
- Back to positions!
- Back!!

46:05.211 --> 46:07.112
Back to your positions!

46:09.482 --> 46:10.950
Kay!

46:14.020 --> 46:15.003
Kay!

46:15.028 --> 46:16.528
Put him down.
They're retreating!

46:17.023 --> 46:20.627
Ulfius is dead.

46:20.695 --> 46:24.231
Then that's it. Take Kay,
take the family, and go out

46:24.299 --> 46:25.934
the way we came in. I'll create

46:25.959 --> 46:27.959
a diversion from the front,
give you time to get away.

46:27.969 --> 46:29.736
- What about you?
- I'll be right behind you.

46:29.804 --> 46:31.739
Someone needs
to provide the diversion.

46:31.806 --> 46:34.509
- Not you, though.
- We have 1 dead and 2 injured.

46:34.576 --> 46:36.022
We have to get them to safety.

46:36.047 --> 46:37.843
I know the pass is important,
but you've done all you could.

46:37.846 --> 46:39.795
Forget about it now.
Come with us.

46:39.820 --> 46:41.020
I'll stay.

46:41.249 --> 46:43.651
- You go.
- No.

46:43.719 --> 46:45.253
No discussions, no arguments.

46:45.320 --> 46:48.556
I want everyone out of here.
Now! Help me get Kay.

46:48.624 --> 46:50.058
Come on.

46:50.126 --> 46:52.593
We'll make them think
that we're all still here,

46:52.661 --> 46:54.862
give you time to escape.
Now get a move on.

46:54.930 --> 46:56.224
We don't have any time.

46:56.225 --> 46:58.854
Arthur. I have orders
from Merlin to protect you.

46:58.868 --> 47:01.102
I don't need protecting
any more.

47:01.170 --> 47:02.936
Look, I know what you're doing,

47:02.961 --> 47:04.705
but you're not going
to set everything else straight

47:04.707 --> 47:06.808
with some stupid gesture.

47:09.879 --> 47:12.514
Listen, take the injured
to the ruined building

47:12.582 --> 47:14.783
we passed on the way in.
I'll follow on--

47:14.851 --> 47:17.186
probably get there
before you.

47:17.253 --> 47:21.123
I'll see you
on the other side.

47:24.260 --> 47:27.229
Mind your footing.
Got her, boys.

47:27.297 --> 47:31.334
- Easy. Be brave.
- Yes.

47:50.588 --> 47:52.956
Cowards!!

47:53.024 --> 47:56.460
Is that all you've got?!
This...

47:56.528 --> 47:59.296
...land belongs
to your king!

47:59.364 --> 48:02.433
And we will protect it
to the death!

48:02.500 --> 48:05.702
They're taunting us,
Wallace.

48:05.770 --> 48:08.405
Are you enjoying
being taunted?

48:08.473 --> 48:10.274
I've sent
for reinforcements.

48:10.341 --> 48:13.644
They're too good for us
to attack just on level numbers.

48:43.976 --> 48:47.478
I promised Morgan I would take
