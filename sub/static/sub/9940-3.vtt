16:08.700 --> 16:10.497
(Door closing)

16:10.580 --> 16:13.936
Mandy called round earlier.
Said she'd got the wrong brother.

16:14.020 --> 16:16.978
Fancied seeing
what an older man could do.

16:17.060 --> 16:20.769
- (Cheering on TV)
- You wanker!

16:38.460 --> 16:40.416
What did they do?

16:42.780 --> 16:46.489
- lan, what did they say?
- What do you think?

16:55.500 --> 16:58.173
l wasn't even bothered
till he brought it up.

16:58.260 --> 17:01.935
Now it's like l'm dragging him
down the aisle. What's up with him?

17:02.020 --> 17:06.570
- He's had a face like a slapped arse.
- Maybe he doesn't want to get married.

17:06.660 --> 17:10.016
Maybe he asked you
cos he thinks that's what you want.

17:10.099 --> 17:14.855
Nine years, no ring on your finger. Most
women would've ditched him by now.

17:14.940 --> 17:17.693
l've thought about it,
but it's never mattered.

17:17.780 --> 17:22.217
You just know whether someone's
right or not. lf it works, it works.

17:22.300 --> 17:24.859
The way things are between us
is perfect.

17:24.940 --> 17:29.889
So why change it? What's the one thing
that breaks up long-term couples?

17:31.260 --> 17:33.296
Other than the pressies and the piss-up,

17:33.380 --> 17:36.850
give me three good reasons
why you wanna get married.

17:44.540 --> 17:47.100
Kev...come out.

17:52.980 --> 17:55.892
- What?
- Why are we getting married?

17:57.620 --> 18:03.172
l think l was excited cos you're meant
to be. You know, the idea of it all.

18:03.260 --> 18:08.539
Nice dress, fancy ring, people looking
at you like you're summat special.

18:08.620 --> 18:09.973
Hmm.

18:11.380 --> 18:15.532
But when l stopped and thought about it,
it just seemed pointless.

18:17.740 --> 18:21.415
We don't need a piece of paper
to tell us we love each other.

18:21.500 --> 18:23.650
No, that's exactly what l was...

18:25.340 --> 18:29.299
Hang on. This isn't a test, is it?
One of them women things?

18:29.380 --> 18:33.339
You pretend you don't wanna do
something to see if l'll talk you round?

18:33.420 --> 18:36.298
Well, if it is, you've just failed!

18:38.980 --> 18:40.936
What'll we tell people?

18:42.380 --> 18:44.848
We've changed our minds.

18:44.940 --> 18:48.615
Actually, don't tell 'em anything
till they've bought the presents.

18:48.700 --> 18:52.329
Size of my family,
we'll get the whole house kitted out!

19:00.060 --> 19:02.016
Do you know what?

19:03.140 --> 19:05.096
l love the arse off you.

19:05.940 --> 19:07.896
How could you not?

19:10.260 --> 19:11.932
(Doorbell ringing)

19:12.020 --> 19:13.692
lgnore it.

19:16.020 --> 19:21.299
(Mum outside) Veronica! Veronica!
Hurry up! l'm gonna wet meself out here!

19:21.380 --> 19:25.339
- (Wedding March playing)
- Picture the scene. Beautiful church.

19:25.420 --> 19:29.732
Sun's shining, all your friends
and family gathered together.

19:30.460 --> 19:35.250
Kev waiting at the front
in his new beige suit, nervous, excited.

19:35.340 --> 19:39.333
Then suddenly you appear,

19:39.420 --> 19:41.570
the blushing bride!

19:41.660 --> 19:43.935
Radiant, voluptuous!

19:44.020 --> 19:50.414
You're walking arm in arm
with your father down the aisle.

19:50.500 --> 19:53.060
He's proud, he's tearful...

19:53.140 --> 19:55.096
He's dead!

19:55.180 --> 19:58.331
Well, that's what he would've wanted...

19:59.300 --> 20:02.975
had the good Lord not seen fit
to take him away from us.

20:03.060 --> 20:04.175
So...

20:06.300 --> 20:08.052
..he left you this instead.

20:09.940 --> 20:14.092
He never made a will because
he didn't want people squabbling over it

20:14.180 --> 20:16.740
so he put that aside.

20:16.820 --> 20:21.416
He was old-fashioned -
reckoned any father worth his salt

20:21.500 --> 20:23.855
should be able
to pay for his daughter's wedding.

20:23.940 --> 20:25.692
Five grand?

20:27.860 --> 20:33.651
He was a good man, Veronica. He wanted
me to keep that until the time was right.

20:33.740 --> 20:37.699
- (Military march playing)
- How do l turn this thing off?

20:38.540 --> 20:40.292
(Switches off music)

20:42.740 --> 20:44.696
(Banging on door)

20:46.060 --> 20:48.176
GO AWAY!

20:48.260 --> 20:51.775
lan Gallagher. Tell lan Gallagher
we want him out here now.

20:51.860 --> 20:56.536
lan? Have you seen him? lf you see him,
you tell him l'm looking for him, all right?

20:56.620 --> 20:58.292
ALL RlGHT?!

21:04.980 --> 21:06.652
Long story.

21:16.300 --> 21:19.451
Why did you lie?
Why did you tell 'em l attacked you?

21:19.540 --> 21:22.100
- Get him away from me.
- Tell them the truth!

21:22.180 --> 21:25.331
- Please! They're gonna kill me!
- Get him away from me!

21:25.420 --> 21:28.093
You need locking up! Fucking pervert!

21:51.460 --> 21:53.451
Kev! Kev! Look!

21:55.700 --> 21:59.579
(lncomprehensible shouting)

22:00.180 --> 22:03.536
Buy your own house! Aye. (Mumbles)

22:04.540 --> 22:08.294
Right-to-buy scheme.
Council are selling off the houses.

22:08.380 --> 22:12.931
- So?
- So five grand plus the bit in the bank.

22:13.020 --> 22:16.774
We could almost buy our place outright.
Our own home, Kev!

22:17.620 --> 22:20.771
What do you think?
Walk down the aisle, couple of ''l do's''.

22:20.860 --> 22:24.011
Be worth it to get our own place.
Gotta get a move on.

22:24.100 --> 22:26.330
Closing date's end of the month.

22:28.660 --> 22:30.616
What's up?

22:33.020 --> 22:34.772
l can't marry you.

22:36.660 --> 22:39.333
There's something you should know.

22:41.660 --> 22:43.412
Fuck me.

22:44.860 --> 22:46.612
Fucking hell.

22:48.060 --> 22:51.609
Roxy Benson.
l remember her from school.

22:53.460 --> 22:55.894
- She were gorgeous.
- She were a 'ead case.

22:55.980 --> 22:59.655
She used to throw plates at me.
She couldn't handle her drink.

22:59.740 --> 23:04.416
Talk about fiery. That's where l got
that scar on the back of me neck.

23:05.260 --> 23:09.378
Oh, the amount of times
l nearly told you over the years,

23:09.460 --> 23:12.896
but, you know, the further away it got,

23:12.980 --> 23:14.936
the more unreal it seemed.

23:16.900 --> 23:21.178
That's the only thing that l have got
to prove that it ever happened.

23:23.860 --> 23:28.217
You look a right twat on there,
don't you? A fucking mullet.

23:28.300 --> 23:31.656
That's worse than finding out
you were married.

23:34.420 --> 23:36.172
l'm sorry.

23:37.820 --> 23:41.972
l just... l didn't want anything
to spoil it for us...

23:42.860 --> 23:45.818
so l buried it.

23:48.180 --> 23:53.379
- How long will it take to divorce her?
- Six months. l dunno, maybe longer.

23:53.940 --> 23:57.615
l think we might have to forget
about buying the house.

24:00.180 --> 24:02.136
Aww, l'm sorry.

24:07.540 --> 24:09.292
Hang on.

24:10.500 --> 24:14.459
- What?
- We don't have to actually get married.

24:15.980 --> 24:20.132
lf my mum wants a wedding...
why don't we give her a wedding?

24:21.820 --> 24:24.493
- You're gonna fake it?
- Why not?

24:24.580 --> 24:26.730
- You can't!
- Why not?

24:26.820 --> 24:29.573
We'll still be married.
lt just won't be legal.

24:29.660 --> 24:32.128
(Cackling laughter)

24:32.220 --> 24:35.451
Dress, rings, photographer, the works.

24:35.540 --> 24:39.010
- lt's got to be like the real thing.
- (Both) Except cheaper.

24:44.780 --> 24:47.169
- Your wedding car, madam.
- Oh, Steve!

24:49.700 --> 24:52.214
- You might have to be in black!
- Whatever!

24:56.580 --> 25:00.255
Quentin, how do you fancy
a couple of months' free rent?

25:01.540 --> 25:03.929
Repeat after me.

25:04.020 --> 25:07.376
l, Veronica Carol Fisher,

25:07.460 --> 25:11.533
take this man, Kevin Alan Ball...

25:11.620 --> 25:14.896
(Veronica) Take this man,
Kevin Alan Ball...

25:14.980 --> 25:17.938
(Quentin) ..to be
my lawfully wedded husband.

25:18.780 --> 25:23.535
- lsn't it illegal to impersonate a vicar?
- You're not a vicar, you're a registrar.

25:24.340 --> 25:25.773
Even so...

25:34.380 --> 25:36.336
Hello, Gallagher.

25:39.580 --> 25:42.538
Tell your brother,
no one gives us the run-around.

25:42.620 --> 25:47.057
lf he shows his face tomorrow,
we'll fucking kill him! You understand?

25:47.140 --> 25:49.176
You understand?! Good.

26:00.660 --> 26:03.777
- Something you're not telling us?
- lt's Mandy Maguire!

26:03.860 --> 26:07.535
- She's not someone you say no to.
- Why'd you want to? Jail bait!

26:07.620 --> 26:10.532
- Kev!
- You can't say she isn't foxy!

26:10.620 --> 26:14.056
lan, why don't l see
if they can't listen to reason?

26:14.140 --> 26:17.212
Whoa, posh lad,
you'll come back in bin bags!

26:17.300 --> 26:20.053
You can't just give in to these people.

26:20.140 --> 26:24.099
l'll go round. l know their old man
from the pub. He's all right.

26:24.180 --> 26:27.058
Well, as violent piss-heads go. Mm?

26:30.460 --> 26:32.610
(Large dog barking)

26:38.140 --> 26:41.052
(Dog snarling and growling)

26:46.700 --> 26:48.611
(Barking and growling)

26:51.500 --> 26:56.255
Where is he? Where the bleedin' hell
is he? He's got his stag do in an hour!

26:56.340 --> 26:58.296
Here you go.

27:00.140 --> 27:02.290
- Ta.
- Do you want another one?

27:02.380 --> 27:05.736
How would we know what's happened?
That eldest's a maniac!

27:05.820 --> 27:08.971
He did for Sally.
Got off cos he intimidated a witness.

27:09.060 --> 27:11.779
- Veronica!
- Hey, he started this mess!

27:11.860 --> 27:16.376
l'll end up a widow before l'm married!
Erm, well, you know, ''married''.

27:16.460 --> 27:21.011
All right, take your time with this one.
You might have to identify the body!

27:21.100 --> 27:24.251
- (Car horn/knocking at door)
- Lip!

27:26.420 --> 27:28.775
- Oh, it's the police.
- Oh, no!

27:28.860 --> 27:32.614
Oh, it's all right, it's only Helmet.
He's got Kev with him.

27:32.700 --> 27:36.295
Oh, thank God for that!
l pictured myself at his funeral!

27:36.380 --> 27:38.336
Black does nothing for me legs!

27:40.260 --> 27:44.253
l thought l were gonna be there all night!
Tone gave me a lift back.

27:44.340 --> 27:46.854
- What happened?
- (Kev sighing)

27:48.420 --> 27:50.570
Well, l goes round there.

27:50.660 --> 27:53.811
l ask if l can have a word,
you know, private and that.

27:53.900 --> 27:58.655
Anyway, fair enough, he invites me in
and they're all sat there in a row.

27:58.740 --> 28:01.891
Every single one of them on the couch,
arms folded,

28:01.980 --> 28:04.733
Alsatian at my feet, growling.

28:05.900 --> 28:08.858
So l explained the situation.

28:08.940 --> 28:13.730
l put lan's case forward -
misunderstanding, blah, blah, blah.

28:13.820 --> 28:16.459
Didn't mean to offend her.

28:16.540 --> 28:18.496
They listened. Fair do's.

28:18.580 --> 28:21.014
They offer us a beer and a spliff.

28:25.580 --> 28:30.131
And basically...l agreed
to keep me ''fecking nose out of it''.

28:30.220 --> 28:32.654
- (Veronica) ls that it?!
- What could l do?

28:32.740 --> 28:34.856
They flogged us a camcorder
for t'wedding.

28:34.940 --> 28:38.296
You useless wanker!
l thought you were dead!

28:38.380 --> 28:41.133
- l can't believe l'm marrying you!
- You're not.

28:41.220 --> 28:43.780
- lan!
- (Door slamming)

28:44.460 --> 28:48.817
See this badge? Now, l know it doesn't
count for a lot round here these days,

28:48.900 --> 28:50.856
but we haven't lost the fight yet.

28:50.940 --> 28:54.216
A word in the right ear
could make things go away.

28:54.300 --> 28:56.734
- l didn't want you getting involved.
- Why not?

28:56.820 --> 28:59.254
We don't need the police
fighting our battles.

28:59.340 --> 29:01.854
Not the police, me, Tony.

29:04.220 --> 29:08.896
Fancy coming out tomorrow? The police
are having a friends-and-family day out.

29:08.980 --> 29:12.529
Bite to eat, a few drinks.
Let your hair down.

29:12.620 --> 29:16.613
They have a rifle range so you can
get your own back on the scum.

29:18.980 --> 29:21.255
lt's Kev and Veronica's wedding
tomorrow.

29:21.340 --> 29:23.490
We're off out on the hen night now.

29:23.580 --> 29:25.332
Right, right.

29:26.860 --> 29:28.816
So do you fancy it or not?

29:28.900 --> 29:31.573
(Raucous, drunken laughter)

29:33.500 --> 29:36.458
OK, you ready? Oh, me chuff!

29:36.540 --> 29:38.496
Oh, come on, V!

29:41.820 --> 29:43.572
(Giggling)

29:44.700 --> 29:46.372
Let's go!

29:47.180 --> 29:51.332
There's only one way out of this.
You know that, don't you?

29:51.420 --> 29:53.376
(Fiona and Veronica giggling)

29:54.540 --> 29:56.496
Tell them.

29:56.580 --> 30:00.255
(Veronica cackling)

30:04.420 --> 30:08.208
- Where am l sleeping?
- Dad's bed's free!

30:08.300 --> 30:10.052
(Giggling) Bugger off!

30:11.300 --> 30:15.054
- You can always kip in with me!
- Keep your hands to yourself!

30:16.020 --> 30:18.853
- (Veronica giggling loudly)
- Shh shh!

30:29.340 --> 30:31.092
Shit!

30:33.260 --> 30:36.491
- (Banging and clattering outside door)
- Hm?

30:45.700 --> 30:49.978
(Tannoy) 'The 5:45 service to London
is leaving from Bay C in five minutes.

30:50.060 --> 30:54.099
'The 5:45 service to London is leaving
from Bay C in five minutes.'

31:21.820 --> 31:23.572
Mandy.

31:26.580 --> 31:30.732
Move! Shift away now! l mean it,
try anything and you're dead!

31:30.820 --> 31:34.813
l'm dead anyway! Your brothers'll
see to that! Mandy, please!

31:34.900 --> 31:37.016
l need to talk to you properly.

31:37.900 --> 31:39.333
Please.

31:40.060 --> 31:41.937
l'm gay.

31:45.540 --> 31:49.499
- That the best you can come up with?
- lf was l gonna make something up...

31:49.580 --> 31:53.255
l'm hanging myself here, you know that,
cos no one knows.

31:53.340 --> 31:58.016
No one in school, no one on the estate.
Lip only knows cos he worked it out.

31:58.100 --> 32:00.773
You're the only person l've ever told.

32:00.860 --> 32:04.011
Like told, like said it to. Out loud.

32:05.220 --> 32:06.369
Look.

32:13.180 --> 32:17.298
Nothing.
l just haven't got the right equipment.

32:17.380 --> 32:19.940
You don't look the gay type.

32:20.020 --> 32:23.569
- ls that better?
- Piss off. You know what l mean.

32:25.380 --> 32:28.656
People'll suss it out, though.
15, no girlfriend.

32:28.740 --> 32:32.892
All them lads at school to gawp at.
You know what you need.

32:32.980 --> 32:34.936
- What?
- A girlfriend.

32:35.020 --> 32:38.774
Like film stars do
when they don't want people knowing.

32:42.740 --> 32:46.289
- What do you get out of it?
- Know what it's like being me?

32:46.380 --> 32:49.736
All them morons hitting on me,
trying to get into me knickers.

32:49.820 --> 32:52.778
l want to find someone nice,
someone interesting.

32:52.860 --> 32:56.899
Someone like you...except not gay.

32:59.780 --> 33:01.736
Fancy coming to a wedding?

33:36.540 --> 33:39.259
(Door slamming)

33:39.340 --> 33:42.935
(Man gasping and humming a tune)

33:43.020 --> 33:44.578
Oh, shit!

33:45.780 --> 33:47.736
(Rumbling downstairs)

34:17.100 --> 34:19.011
yaaaaaaah!

34:23.860 --> 34:25.771
yaaaaaaah! yaaaaaaah!

34:30.340 --> 34:34.618
lt's me! Marty! How yer doin', mate?

34:36.420 --> 34:38.695
(Cymbals crash)

34:40.460 --> 34:43.020
Couldn't you have rang the doorbell?

34:43.100 --> 34:47.775
Didn't wanna wake you up. You know
Marty - thoughtful as ever. Sun face!

34:48.980 --> 34:51.652
- You got any sugar?
- Yeah.

34:53.380 --> 34:58.010
Cheers. Me mam rang, told me you were
getting married, said send a card.

34:58.100 --> 35:02.059
l'm thinking, ''Sod that. Big sister
getting hooked, gonna be there.''

35:02.140 --> 35:07.692
(Jibbers) Buckit munk! Hey, wouldn't
have missed this for the world.

35:07.780 --> 35:11.056
You know what they say -
Marty! Never misses a party!

35:11.140 --> 35:14.018
Last time l heard, you were in prison.

35:14.100 --> 35:17.490
- Yeah, l was. Five stretch.
- When did you get out?

35:18.220 --> 35:19.778
Last night!

35:24.780 --> 35:27.214
- What?
- l need to talk to Veronica.

35:29.260 --> 35:32.297
lt's the day of the wedding.
lt's bad luck.

35:34.340 --> 35:36.296
What have you got on your face?

35:37.620 --> 35:42.057
- What's he in for?
- Aggravated burglary and arson.

35:42.140 --> 35:45.689
Remember the dole office going up
on election day? That were him.

35:45.780 --> 35:49.739
- He loves setting fire to things.
- He's a maniac. He came at me.

35:49.820 --> 35:54.098
Almost felt me heart stop. Then we're
having a brew and he starts all that...

35:54.180 --> 35:57.809
- What's that?
- Tourette's coupled with hypermania.

35:57.900 --> 36:01.449
- A psychologist's wet dream.
- What are you gonna do?

36:01.540 --> 36:03.815
Ship him out, preferably back to prison.

36:03.900 --> 36:08.849
lf there's one person you can rely on
to really fuck things up, it's Marty.

36:11.900 --> 36:13.492
Hmm...mmm...mmm.

36:13.580 --> 36:16.936
You can't stay, Marty, you're in prison.

36:17.020 --> 36:20.171
Only a Cat D.
They practically give you your own key.

36:20.260 --> 36:22.854
You've got to go back, Marty.

36:22.940 --> 36:28.333
lt was nice of you to make the effort,
but if they catch you, your parole's gone.

36:29.900 --> 36:33.176
- How long have you got left?
- 18 months. Wanky!

36:33.260 --> 36:36.252
Exactly. No time.

36:36.340 --> 36:39.173
But it's your wedding day...
Buckit, buckit, bi...!

36:40.340 --> 36:45.289
They'll be looking for you. Why don't you
go back, hand yourself in?

36:45.380 --> 36:49.498
Tell 'em it was a mistake, moment
of madness, won't happen again.

36:49.580 --> 36:53.255
Me and Kev'll back you up,
make sure they listen to you.

36:54.180 --> 36:56.853
- You know it's for the best.
- Buckus!

36:58.180 --> 37:01.616
Drink up. We can have you back
before breakfast.

37:01.700 --> 37:06.820
l am not going back, Ronnie! l'm not
missing your wedding day, all right?

37:10.740 --> 37:13.174
- What time is it?
- Quarter to twelve.

37:13.260 --> 37:15.216
(Sighing) We've got two hours.

37:15.300 --> 37:18.258
We'll just have to let him come,
sort it out after.

37:18.340 --> 37:21.616
No way, Kev! l'm not having
that nutcase at my wedding!

37:21.700 --> 37:25.739
One wrong word and everything'll
go ballistic! lmagine the service!

37:25.820 --> 37:31.292
''Do you, Veronica - buckabit - Fisher,
take Kevin - donkey-bit - Ball?''

37:31.380 --> 37:33.735
- Sorry!
- That wouldn't be so bad.

37:33.820 --> 37:39.133
We'll be laughed out the building! He's
going back if l have to drag him there!

37:40.140 --> 37:42.574
You all right in there, Marty?

37:42.660 --> 37:44.616
Marty, are you OK?

37:44.700 --> 37:48.249
- Whereabouts, V?
- Hanging up, soon as you walk in.

37:49.380 --> 37:51.530
- lt's not.
- You what?

37:51.620 --> 37:54.578
(Marty) Nice wedding dress, Veronica.

37:56.060 --> 37:58.016
Burn a treat, this will.

37:59.460 --> 38:03.578
You try and send me back to prison,
the dress goes up,

38:03.660 --> 38:05.616
house goes up, we all go up.

38:07.340 --> 38:09.900
Marty, open the door.

38:10.860 --> 38:15.058
- Open the bleedin' door!
- Shouldn't talk about Marty like that.

38:15.140 --> 38:18.177
- Ohhhh!
- (Marty) lt's not fair.

38:18.260 --> 38:23.857
Marty doesn't like it. And you're not
getting married without me!

38:24.940 --> 38:28.899
- (Marty) Buckabit, buckabit!
- (Lip laughing) Sorry.

38:35.060 --> 38:37.051
(Veronica) What's he doing?

38:37.140 --> 38:38.937
Just sitting there.

38:40.620 --> 38:44.579
- Lighting matches.
- Jesus Christ!

38:44.660 --> 38:49.859
He'll burn us down! At me grandad's
funeral, he gutted half the hospice!

38:49.940 --> 38:52.898
Let's just call the cops.
At least we'll get shot of him.

38:52.980 --> 38:56.655
Kev's right. lf the house goes up,
we can't get him out of there.

38:56.740 --> 38:59.538
What about the wedding?
This is our big day!

38:59.620 --> 39:02.578
- He's your brother!
- He's always been like this!

39:02.660 --> 39:07.176
Hates anyone else being the centre
of attention! lt's always about him!

39:07.260 --> 39:09.216
He wants putting in a nuthouse!

39:09.300 --> 39:12.053
- Oi, oi, what's going on?
- Bit of a problem.

39:12.140 --> 39:14.096
Can we put things back an hour?

39:14.180 --> 39:18.935
The room's booked till three. We can't
change things now. What's happened?

39:19.020 --> 39:22.092
- Veronica, your mum's here.
- Get him out of here!

39:22.180 --> 39:25.570
Fiona, tell her l can't see her.
Just get rid of her!

39:26.180 --> 39:28.853
- Never get married.
- Carol...

39:28.940 --> 39:32.819
Veronica wants you coordinating things
at the other end.

39:35.660 --> 39:39.733
The whole thing's ruined.
We've got to be there in an hour.

39:39.820 --> 39:43.893
And l've got that wanker
stuck in me bathroom!

39:46.420 --> 39:48.376
C-Call it Catholic guilt,

39:48.460 --> 39:52.499
but l am starting to think
there's a message in here somewhere.

39:52.580 --> 39:57.495
All l want is to own me own home...
for us.

39:57.580 --> 40:01.937
Somewhere we can feel safe,
somewhere we can call our own.

40:02.020 --> 40:04.375
Maybe fetch kids up in.

40:07.300 --> 40:10.849
- l thought you didn't want any kids.
- Based on what?

40:10.940 --> 40:15.695
- On you saying how much you hate 'em.
- Yeah, other people's.

40:15.780 --> 40:19.329
But l might not mind a baby Kev
running around.

40:22.500 --> 40:27.449
What are we gonna do? Shall we call it
off? Say we've had second thoughts?

40:27.540 --> 40:29.656
No chance.

40:29.740 --> 40:34.689
ln an hour's time, we're getting married
and there's nothing gonna stop that.

40:36.620 --> 40:42.138
Remember when we were kids? How
you'd always tag along wherever l went.

40:43.500 --> 40:47.175
l know l got angry and that,
shouted at you...

40:48.420 --> 40:51.571
but l always looked after you,
didn't l, Marty?

40:52.900 --> 40:55.209
You know why?

40:55.300 --> 40:57.814
Because l'm your big sister...

40:58.860 --> 41:03.012
and l didn't want you getting
in any trouble because l love you.

41:06.220 --> 41:10.179
And that's why
l want you to go back to prison.

41:17.020 --> 41:20.171
But l've been thinking
about the wedding...

41:21.460 --> 41:23.416
and you know something?

41:24.900 --> 41:27.289
You're right.

41:27.380 --> 41:29.052
Because...

41:31.380 --> 41:35.931
my wedding day
wouldn't be my wedding day...

41:38.380 --> 41:40.530
without my little brother there.

41:44.420 --> 41:46.172
ln fact...

41:47.260 --> 41:51.219
l'd like you to be the one
to give me away.

41:56.220 --> 41:57.778
Marty?

42:03.460 --> 42:05.416
You mean it?

42:06.500 --> 42:08.855
Cross me heart.

42:10.660 --> 42:14.619
Oh, come here and give us an 'ug,
you daft little bugger!

42:16.620 --> 42:19.009
What...? You...

42:19.860 --> 42:23.489
You bitch! You lying, two-faced...
buckit's munk!

42:25.940 --> 42:27.896
l'll burn your fucking house down!

42:32.340 --> 42:36.458
- Performance of a lifetime.
- Just call me Nurse Ronnie!

42:36.540 --> 42:39.612
- Right, let's get him out of here.
- Nice one.

42:54.940 --> 42:59.092
Yeah, mid-twenties, probably a junkie.
He looks like he might be dead.

42:59.180 --> 43:02.570
Chatsworth Park.
He's frightening the kiddies. All right.

43:04.300 --> 43:06.052
Sorted.

- Quentin.
