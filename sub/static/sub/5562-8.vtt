WEBVTT

00:03.604 --> 00:06.137
Sam returned to work
with the cia task force.

00:06.139 --> 00:07.471
Focus of his investigation

00:07.473 --> 00:09.573
Was sudanese ex-governor
tahir khaled.

00:09.575 --> 00:11.308
Hetty:
<i> That's khaled's sister, jada.</i>

00:11.310 --> 00:12.609
Callen: How are you
gonna handle jada?

00:12.611 --> 00:14.410
I'm gonna take her back
to the united states.

00:14.412 --> 00:16.311
There are times that
I have hated my brother,

00:16.313 --> 00:18.146
But I could not
betray him like this.

00:18.148 --> 00:21.149
He would have to kill me
to restore honor to our family.

00:21.151 --> 00:23.518
You're a spy.
Kill him.

00:23.520 --> 00:25.753
Go, go! Go, go, go!
Move.

00:25.755 --> 00:27.354
Get down!
(automatic gun fires)

00:28.690 --> 00:30.423
You're on
american soil now.

00:30.425 --> 00:32.191
You'll be asked to testify
against your brother.

00:32.193 --> 00:34.059
What are you talking about?

00:34.061 --> 00:36.327
You'll never see me again.

00:36.329 --> 00:38.462
Jada: You made me turn my back
on the only family I had left.

00:38.464 --> 00:41.164
Life with my brother
was not perfect.

00:41.166 --> 00:43.466
But at least
I thought I had you.

01:01.418 --> 01:03.084
Cheer up, jada.

01:03.086 --> 01:05.486
You're not gonna get traffic
like this in wisconsin.

01:08.424 --> 01:10.424
What is it I will get?

01:10.426 --> 01:13.760
Hmm, thousand types of
cheese, great skiing,

01:13.762 --> 01:15.227
And no one trying
to murder you.

01:18.799 --> 01:22.467
I will never again see
my family or my homeland.

01:22.469 --> 01:25.470
This does not sound like
much of a reward to me.

01:25.472 --> 01:28.840
The reward is life on your
terms not your family.

01:28.842 --> 01:31.309
New name,
new identity.

01:31.311 --> 01:34.178
This horror story,
it's over.

01:34.180 --> 01:36.180
You testified
against your brother.

01:36.182 --> 01:37.314
I don't have to tell you

01:37.316 --> 01:39.649
How many lives that'll
save in the end.

01:39.651 --> 01:41.317
You're a hero.

01:41.319 --> 01:43.352
I don't meet many
of those nowadays.

01:43.354 --> 01:45.753
I'm gonna miss having
you around, jada.

01:49.525 --> 01:52.659
What will be
my new name?

01:52.661 --> 01:55.261
(chuckles)

01:55.263 --> 01:56.328
It's...

02:01.668 --> 02:04.235
(ears ringing)

02:04.237 --> 02:07.137
(automatic guns fire)
(men shout)

02:09.641 --> 02:11.340
(muffled):
I got you, jada.

02:11.342 --> 02:12.774
(marshal speaks indistinctly)

02:22.118 --> 02:23.484
(ear ringing ends)

02:46.175 --> 02:47.507
Marshal:
Jada.

02:58.586 --> 03:01.353
¶ ¶

03:19.672 --> 03:21.204
I'm not trying
to give her a hard time.

03:21.206 --> 03:22.772
I'm just pointing out
that she's late.

03:22.773 --> 03:24.339
Deeks: Yeah, but "late" is
a relative concept.

03:24.342 --> 03:26.308
Callen: There's nothing
relative about showing up

03:26.310 --> 03:27.642
At a specific point in time.

03:27.644 --> 03:29.176
Either you're there
or you're not.

03:29.178 --> 03:30.744
Yeah, but I'm talking
about l.A. Time,

03:30.745 --> 03:32.311
Which is a chronological
zone unto itself.

03:32.314 --> 03:33.846
See, in this town
you get a buffer

03:33.848 --> 03:36.181
Of 20 minutes for traffic,
cloudy skies--

03:36.183 --> 03:39.651
God forbid it actually rains--
and general selfishness.

03:39.653 --> 03:41.319
None of which changes the fact
that kensi is late.

03:41.321 --> 03:42.453
Again.

03:42.455 --> 03:43.620
That's true.

03:43.622 --> 03:44.954
Where's sam?

03:44.956 --> 03:47.489
Sam is having a little
alone time in the gym.

03:47.491 --> 03:51.192
Jada khaled is going
into witness protection today.

03:51.194 --> 03:53.594
Wow, has he talked to her?

03:53.596 --> 03:54.928
They haven't spoken
in four years,

03:54.930 --> 03:57.297
Not since jada found out
that sam was actually ncis.

03:58.466 --> 04:01.767
Woman was ready to give up her
entire life to be with him.

04:01.769 --> 04:03.568
Yeah, I think I'd want
some alone time too.

04:03.570 --> 04:05.236
Mm-hmm.

04:05.238 --> 04:07.771
(hums)
your coffee's cold.

04:07.773 --> 04:09.305
Compliments
of the psb.

04:09.307 --> 04:11.774
What?! Kensi, no!

04:11.776 --> 04:13.742
Don't make a joke, I am not
in the mood for this right now.

04:13.744 --> 04:16.778
Why don't you let me
handle the psb?

04:16.780 --> 04:19.247
Because I don't need you
to handle the psb.

04:19.249 --> 04:20.314
What is the psb?

04:20.316 --> 04:22.316
Deeks: Parking...
Kensi: Don't...

04:22.318 --> 04:23.483
Get him involved in this, okay?

04:23.485 --> 04:26.252
Do you want me
to google psb right now?

04:26.254 --> 04:27.720
It stands for "parking
spot bitch," okay?

04:27.722 --> 04:29.755
What?

04:29.757 --> 04:31.289
Every day, I go to starbucks,

04:31.291 --> 04:33.291
And this chick
in a red porsche pulls up

04:33.293 --> 04:35.426
About 30 seconds behind me
and double-parks,

04:35.428 --> 04:37.594
Completely blocking me in,
so I can't leave

04:37.596 --> 04:39.596
Until she gets her
pumpkin-spiced

04:39.598 --> 04:41.298
Double-shot flavored
concoction

04:41.299 --> 04:42.999
That basic girls like her get
on the way to the office,

04:43.001 --> 04:46.335
An office which, unlike me,
she arrives to on time.

04:46.337 --> 04:48.337
Are you sure
this isn't iced?

04:48.339 --> 04:50.289
Okay, what am I supposed to do?

04:50.290 --> 04:52.240
Badge her and claim
it's national security?

04:52.242 --> 04:54.375
Tomorrow morning,
we show up in the challenger,

04:54.377 --> 04:56.710
We block<i> her</i> in
after she's blocked you.

04:56.712 --> 04:58.445
That's what I'm talking about.

04:58.447 --> 05:01.314
I'm not sure that blocking
the entire street at rush hour

05:01.316 --> 05:04.250
And intimidating the psb
is my idea of subtle.

05:04.252 --> 05:07.319
Psb will be mia asap.

05:07.321 --> 05:09.654
All right, yeah, I just wanted
to talk about this.

05:09.656 --> 05:12.356
I wasn't looking to initiate
an operation to neutralize her.

05:12.358 --> 05:14.257
That is the perfect solution.

05:14.259 --> 05:15.691
I'm not asking you
for a solution.

05:15.693 --> 05:17.576
Sounded like she was
asking for help.

05:17.577 --> 05:19.460
I don't understand why you're
freaking out so much.

05:19.463 --> 05:21.396
Oh, you are such guys.

05:21.398 --> 05:23.998
Women sometimes just want
to talk about something.

05:24.000 --> 05:26.733
They're not looking
for advice or a solution.

05:28.870 --> 05:30.669
Wow.

05:30.671 --> 05:33.672
Sometimes I wish I wasn't
the only female in this bullpen.

05:33.674 --> 05:36.041
There, I said it.

05:40.047 --> 05:42.047
Sam.

05:42.049 --> 05:45.315
I know you wanted to be alone,
but we need to talk.

05:47.285 --> 05:48.751
Did jada make
her flight?

05:48.753 --> 05:51.420
No, it's bad.

05:51.422 --> 05:54.456
Jada's transport vehicle
was attacked 20 minutes ago.

05:54.458 --> 05:56.691
Two u.S. Marshals killed,
two wounded.

05:56.693 --> 06:00.027
She managed
to survive the ambush.

06:00.029 --> 06:01.995
Where is she?

06:01.997 --> 06:04.430
Well, that's our first problem.

06:04.432 --> 06:06.432
The traffic cams
on the street went dark

06:06.434 --> 06:08.567
Five minutes
before the ambush.

06:08.569 --> 06:10.435
Now, the point
man on the scene

06:10.437 --> 06:12.537
Was a u.S. Marshal
named drew groller.

06:12.539 --> 06:15.006
Nell: He's been handling
jada's protective detail

06:15.008 --> 06:16.874
Since we brought her
back from sudan.

06:16.876 --> 06:18.442
Eric: Groller said
the assault team used

06:18.444 --> 06:19.443
Smoke grenades
to cover their retreat.

06:19.445 --> 06:21.978
Vanished without a trace.

06:21.980 --> 06:23.980
And so did jada.
Without camera coverage

06:23.982 --> 06:25.348
Or the ability to see
through the smoke,

06:25.350 --> 06:27.450
We can't confirm
her whereabouts.

06:27.452 --> 06:28.918
Could have used
bigger explosives

06:28.919 --> 06:30.385
On the transport vehicle
and killed everyone inside.

06:30.388 --> 06:32.354
Which means they wanted
jada to come out alive.

06:32.356 --> 06:35.990
So she's somewhere hoping
that we find her before they do.

06:35.992 --> 06:37.758
Who are these guys?

06:37.760 --> 06:40.093
Marshals captured one
of them, diego salazar--

06:40.095 --> 06:43.563
A mexican national with ties
to the molina cartel.

06:43.565 --> 06:44.897
Jada's from sudan.

06:44.899 --> 06:46.832
She doesn't have any ties
to the molina cartel.

06:46.834 --> 06:48.834
But her brother tahir is
still on the loose.

06:48.836 --> 06:49.935
She testified against him.

06:49.937 --> 06:51.270
Turns out the
war criminals

06:51.271 --> 06:52.604
Are not the most
forgiving of types.

06:52.606 --> 06:54.839
Kensi: Tahir would have
inflicted revenge himself,

06:54.841 --> 06:56.373
But he's stuck in sudan.

06:56.375 --> 06:59.509
Molina cartel specializes
in hits and kidnapping.

06:59.511 --> 07:02.011
Could have outsourced
it to them.

07:02.013 --> 07:04.480
You want me to interrogate
diego salazar?

07:04.482 --> 07:06.515
I had him moved to the boatshed.

07:06.517 --> 07:10.118
He took a bullet to the thigh
during the ambush.

07:10.120 --> 07:11.452
The wound's been cleaned
and bandaged

07:11.454 --> 07:13.454
But otherwise untreated.

07:13.456 --> 07:16.924
He's probably very
uncomfortable at the moment.

07:16.926 --> 07:19.459
Who leaked jada's convoy route?

07:19.461 --> 07:21.627
Well, the hague just learned
their database was hacked.

07:21.629 --> 07:23.528
The packet of files
that were breached

07:23.530 --> 07:26.063
Contains jada's itinerary
while in los angeles.

07:26.065 --> 07:27.898
I reviewed the hack.

07:27.899 --> 07:29.732
It's the kind of high-end job
you only see from nation states

07:29.735 --> 07:33.670
And cartels with the resources
of nation states.

07:33.672 --> 07:35.038
Callen:
This ambush is a bold move.

07:35.040 --> 07:37.023
Would have had
to have been approved

07:37.024 --> 07:39.007
By molina's senior leadership
in los angeles.

07:39.010 --> 07:40.743
Well, we think
that's alex molina.

07:40.745 --> 07:43.078
He's the eldest son of arturo

07:43.080 --> 07:45.513
And rumored to be
next in line to the throne.

07:45.515 --> 07:47.515
We "think" alex?

07:47.517 --> 07:49.517
Nell: Well, this is the dea's
only photograph of him,

07:49.519 --> 07:51.519
Taken at age 12.

07:51.521 --> 07:52.653
His father made sure
he was protected

07:52.655 --> 07:54.655
From the public eye
his entire life.

07:54.657 --> 07:56.990
The only intel we have
on alex indicates

07:56.992 --> 07:58.658
That while he's
extremely private,

07:58.660 --> 08:00.660
He does fit the mold
of the dashing playboy.

08:00.662 --> 08:02.728
Fortunately, the dea
is close to getting

08:02.730 --> 08:05.030
Its first look at
alex as a grown man.

08:05.032 --> 08:08.933
So you combine the molina cartel
with a dashing playboy scion

08:08.935 --> 08:10.935
Being investigated
by the dea,

08:10.937 --> 08:14.605
That can only lead to one
possible... Scenario.

08:14.607 --> 08:17.407
Dea agent talia del campo.

08:17.409 --> 08:18.808
Exactly.

08:18.810 --> 08:21.043
She was assigned
to the case last month.

08:21.045 --> 08:24.046
She recently scored an invite
to alex molina's mansion

08:24.048 --> 08:26.048
For a pool party,
and she just notified us

08:26.050 --> 08:28.116
That she'd,
quote-unquote,

08:28.118 --> 08:31.419
"be happy to have kensi
tag along as her plus one."

08:31.421 --> 08:32.753
So charming.

08:32.755 --> 08:35.155
Work with talia.

08:35.157 --> 08:36.756
Find out everything
you can on alex molina.

08:36.758 --> 08:38.891
We'll hit the ambush
site, debrief groller.

08:38.893 --> 08:40.893
What about sam?

08:40.895 --> 08:43.896
Sam is gonna have
his hands full.

08:43.898 --> 08:45.898
You think I got emotionally
involved with jada

08:45.900 --> 08:47.866
During that undercover
op in the sudan.

08:47.868 --> 08:51.703
You think it's a risk for
me to interrogate salazar,

08:51.705 --> 08:53.772
But you think
it's less of a risk

08:53.773 --> 08:55.840
Than me crossing paths
with jada somewhere out there.

08:55.842 --> 08:57.741
I'm not worried
about you and salazar.

08:59.578 --> 09:02.579
And you did get emotionally
involved with jada on that job.

09:02.581 --> 09:04.847
She'll always be
my responsibility, granger.

09:04.849 --> 09:06.181
Then this interrogation's

09:06.183 --> 09:08.550
Your way of making sure
she stays alive.

09:10.654 --> 09:13.988
How uncomfortable is
salazar allowed to get?

09:13.990 --> 09:17.558
That's entirely
up to you, agent hanna.

09:17.560 --> 09:19.626
Extra strength
pain killers.

09:46.020 --> 09:47.019
Thank you, sir.

09:47.021 --> 09:48.553
Callen:
Marshal groller?

09:48.555 --> 09:50.555
(groans)

09:50.557 --> 09:51.856
That hit squad's good.

09:51.858 --> 09:54.859
Small unit,
uh, tactics.

09:54.861 --> 09:56.193
Well-organized.

09:56.195 --> 09:57.928
Probably former
military.

09:57.930 --> 10:00.764
I lost two good men today.

10:00.766 --> 10:02.031
But any of us would
have sacrificed

10:02.033 --> 10:03.799
Just to get jada out alive.

10:03.801 --> 10:05.133
You like her?

10:05.135 --> 10:06.534
Groller:
Yeah, I do.

10:06.536 --> 10:08.936
I saw her every day
for four years.

10:08.938 --> 10:10.771
She became my
responsibility

10:10.773 --> 10:12.939
When your team pulled
her out of sudan.

10:12.941 --> 10:14.941
Why'd she run?

10:14.942 --> 10:16.942
As opposed to getting trapped
in the truck and killed?

10:16.945 --> 10:19.812
If we don't find jada, chances
are the molina cartel will,

10:19.814 --> 10:22.914
So now is not the time
to withhold things, groller.

10:25.018 --> 10:27.718
She didn't want to enter
witness protection.

10:27.720 --> 10:31.521
She doesn't have
any friends here.

10:31.523 --> 10:34.090
Tahir is the only family
she's got left.

10:34.092 --> 10:35.558
You mean the homicidal maniac

10:35.560 --> 10:36.959
That probably masterminded
this thing?

10:38.195 --> 10:39.961
Your team does a lot of good

10:39.963 --> 10:42.263
And saves a lot of lives.

10:42.265 --> 10:43.797
But have you ever thought about

10:43.799 --> 10:46.966
What happens to people
after the case is wrapped?

10:46.968 --> 10:48.634
Every day.

10:48.636 --> 10:49.635
Does sam hanna?

10:49.637 --> 10:51.737
He was jada's

10:51.739 --> 10:53.105
Only friend in america.

10:53.107 --> 10:55.240
As soon as she agreed
to testify against tahir,

10:55.242 --> 10:57.742
He vanished from her life.

10:57.744 --> 10:58.909
You ever run a deep cover op?

10:58.911 --> 11:01.544
No.

11:01.546 --> 11:03.846
Sam accomplished his mission.

11:03.848 --> 11:04.947
Groller:
And I failed mine,

11:04.949 --> 11:08.016
Because jada's missing.

11:08.018 --> 11:09.717
But if you want to find her,

11:09.719 --> 11:11.402
I suggest you ask yourselves

11:11.403 --> 11:13.086
Whether she wanted to be saved
by you in the first place.

11:19.194 --> 11:21.194
Jada may reach
out to him.

11:21.196 --> 11:22.862
I'm gonna have nell
and eric tag his phone.

11:22.864 --> 11:25.631
He's a piece of work.

11:25.633 --> 11:27.232
He's also right.

11:27.234 --> 11:28.900
Come on, man.

11:28.902 --> 11:30.701
It's just the ugly
part of what we do.

11:30.703 --> 11:32.969
I mean, I think about this
all the time.

11:32.971 --> 11:35.638
And the truth is, if I'm
undercover by the time we meet,

11:35.640 --> 11:37.806
Chances are nobody's gonna get
that fairy-tale ending.

11:37.808 --> 11:38.940
You think about sam,

11:38.942 --> 11:40.608
You think about
this job...

11:40.609 --> 11:42.275
He handled it
the only way he could.

11:42.278 --> 11:44.011
Never doubted that for a second.

11:44.013 --> 11:45.145
And he's right about jada.

11:45.147 --> 11:46.846
We came into
this mission

11:46.848 --> 11:48.314
Thinking that
she wanted to be found.

11:48.316 --> 11:49.848
That we were rescuing her

11:49.850 --> 11:52.050
From tahir
and the molina cartel.

11:52.052 --> 11:54.886
What if the people
she hates the most are us?

12:15.875 --> 12:17.774
(door opens)

12:17.776 --> 12:19.142
(door closes)

12:19.144 --> 12:20.776
Is he talking?

12:20.778 --> 12:23.779
Not even to the medics

12:23.781 --> 12:25.380
Who pulled the bullet
out of his leg.

12:27.250 --> 12:29.850
But this is your interrogation,
not mine.

12:32.754 --> 12:35.154
This file's thin.

12:35.156 --> 12:36.822
Then I'd get to work, mr. Hanna.

12:49.169 --> 12:51.369
I took a bullet
in the leg once.

12:51.371 --> 12:53.771
In lebanon,
years ago.

12:53.773 --> 12:57.841
That's when guys like us fall
back on our training, right?

12:57.843 --> 13:01.044
Made a paracord
tourniquet...

13:01.046 --> 13:02.412
Had my leg up
for about seven hours.

13:02.414 --> 13:04.080
When it finally came off,

13:04.082 --> 13:07.015
My leg was as good as new.

13:08.885 --> 13:10.851
I'm sorry, am I boring you?

13:10.853 --> 13:12.886
I had the same training you did.

13:12.888 --> 13:14.220
Mexican special
forces, right?

13:16.824 --> 13:18.824
World-class interrogators.

13:18.825 --> 13:20.825
You probably know what's
gonna come out of my mouth

13:20.828 --> 13:22.194
Before I even say it.

13:22.196 --> 13:23.979
You're establishing
a rapport

13:23.980 --> 13:25.763
Based on our military
backgrounds, yeah.

13:25.766 --> 13:27.732
Yeah.

13:27.734 --> 13:30.801
Well, gotta start
somewhere, diego.

13:30.803 --> 13:32.335
Painkillers.

13:35.039 --> 13:37.706
I know what
you're feeling.

13:37.708 --> 13:39.908
The pain racing
through your body

13:39.910 --> 13:44.345
After all the adrenaline's gone.

13:44.347 --> 13:45.813
Hmm.

13:45.815 --> 13:49.316
The thing is,

13:49.318 --> 13:51.818
You're gonna break
way before seven hours.

13:51.820 --> 13:55.054
Because you need me to talk

13:55.056 --> 13:57.322
Before my team
hunts down jada khaled?

13:57.324 --> 14:00.758
Because you never been
in the military.

14:00.760 --> 14:03.193
Otherwise, you'd have known
that the only thing that happens

14:03.195 --> 14:06.129
After you've had a paracord
tourniquet on your leg

14:06.131 --> 14:08.331
For seven hours is amputation.

14:08.333 --> 14:10.398
Week one boot camp.

14:13.469 --> 14:16.102
Which part of your file
shall we debunk next?

14:16.104 --> 14:17.903
Callen:
<i> Talk to me, eric.</i>

14:17.905 --> 14:19.704
Eric:
Marshall groller
just took a call

14:19.706 --> 14:20.705
From an unknown number.

14:20.707 --> 14:22.740
It's coming from
a burn phone

14:22.742 --> 14:23.907
And the signal's
originating

14:23.909 --> 14:26.142
Three miles from
the ambush site.

14:26.144 --> 14:27.309
Where's groller now?

14:27.311 --> 14:28.577
Eric:
He's driving in

14:28.578 --> 14:29.844
The opposite direction
of the caller,

14:29.846 --> 14:30.778
Headed to the 101.

14:30.780 --> 14:32.880
Any anomalies in his file?

14:32.882 --> 14:34.915
He's totally clean.

14:34.917 --> 14:36.016
He wouldn't have
been assigned

14:36.018 --> 14:37.450
To protect a high value witness

14:37.452 --> 14:38.951
Like jada otherwise.

14:38.953 --> 14:40.018
Callen:
Keep tracking him.

14:40.020 --> 14:42.020
We'll see where he leads us.

14:42.022 --> 14:44.088
(latin rock music playing)

14:54.366 --> 14:56.199
All right, run me through
our cover story one more time.

14:56.201 --> 14:59.035
I'm a former runway model
from buenos aires.

14:59.037 --> 14:59.902
You're my sister.

14:59.904 --> 15:01.870
And?
That's it.

15:01.872 --> 15:02.871
That's kind of thin.

15:02.873 --> 15:04.373
Yeah, well,
it got me

15:04.374 --> 15:05.874
To alex molina's doorstep
in less than a month.

15:05.876 --> 15:07.342
Trust me, as long as
you fill out that bikini,

15:07.344 --> 15:09.143
They won't ask
too many questions in there.

15:09.145 --> 15:10.277
All right, what's our protocol?

15:10.279 --> 15:11.278
They're gonna
search us.

15:11.280 --> 15:12.813
They're gonna
take our phones.

15:12.814 --> 15:14.347
You might want to put
your gun in the glove box.

15:14.349 --> 15:15.915
Dea put a camera
inside my lipstick

15:15.917 --> 15:17.249
To take pics of alex molina.

15:17.251 --> 15:20.018
They also gave me
some gps trackers,

15:20.020 --> 15:21.452
Just in case we want
to keep tabs on people.

15:21.454 --> 15:23.487
Perfect.

15:23.489 --> 15:26.022
We are officially in
cartel country, princess.

15:26.024 --> 15:27.523
Ten women for
every single one of those

15:27.525 --> 15:29.024
Sinaloa cowboys in there.

15:29.026 --> 15:30.959
Literally an hour ago,
I was complaining

15:30.961 --> 15:33.394
About being surrounded by men
all day every day at work.

15:33.396 --> 15:35.028
This makes me feel
like I'm pretty lucky.

15:35.030 --> 15:37.096
I hate being treated
like a piece of fresh meat,

15:37.098 --> 15:38.363
Even if it is just undercover.

15:38.365 --> 15:40.131
You and I both.

15:40.133 --> 15:41.966
Honestly,

15:41.968 --> 15:44.134
Sometimes it takes me a week,
if not more,

15:44.136 --> 15:46.970
To start respecting men again
after a job like this.

15:46.972 --> 15:49.806
Really? I thought
I was the only one.

15:49.808 --> 15:51.658
You kidding?

15:51.659 --> 15:53.509
Didn't peg you
for the sensitive type.
Well, I guess

15:53.511 --> 15:56.144
You should see my after-work
routine on days like this.
Ah, let me guess.

15:56.146 --> 15:58.246
An hour in the shower
scrubbing yourself raw,

15:58.248 --> 16:00.414
And a pint of haagen-dazs
on the couch.

16:00.416 --> 16:02.349
Not even close.
Oh.

16:02.351 --> 16:05.018
Cold stone on the chaise.

16:05.020 --> 16:07.020
I like it.

16:07.022 --> 16:08.354
Hey.

16:08.356 --> 16:10.222
I'm glad I'm not walking
in there alone.

16:10.224 --> 16:13.258
(exhales)
let's get to work.

16:13.260 --> 16:14.959
Manny!

16:14.961 --> 16:17.995
Long time no see.

16:17.997 --> 16:19.796
Who's your plus one?

16:19.798 --> 16:21.097
This is my
sister, kensi.

16:21.099 --> 16:22.398
Hi.

16:22.400 --> 16:24.032
Kensi:
So this is manny,
the one you've

16:24.034 --> 16:25.299
Been telling me about.

16:25.301 --> 16:27.434
You know she only hears
about the cute ones.

16:27.436 --> 16:29.936
Search them.

16:29.938 --> 16:33.472
¶ already warned ya,
he don't want it... ¶

16:33.474 --> 16:34.940
Thank you.
Thank you.

16:34.942 --> 16:35.974
Mm-hmm.

16:35.976 --> 16:37.241
Hey, um...

16:37.243 --> 16:39.309
Are we ever gonna get
to meet alex?

16:39.311 --> 16:41.277
You girls play nice,
and we'll see.

16:41.279 --> 16:43.078
(giggles)
so cute.

16:43.080 --> 16:45.146
¶ ¶

16:47.950 --> 16:51.985
Eric (over radio):
Marshal groller should be coming
around the corner right about...

16:51.987 --> 16:53.353
Now.

16:53.355 --> 16:55.188
(shutter clicks)

16:55.190 --> 16:57.890
Callen: He's good.
Countersurveillance route

16:57.892 --> 17:00.359
To get here; knows how
to look for tails.

17:00.361 --> 17:02.327
We're lucky we
got this close.

17:03.963 --> 17:06.830
(quietly):
Come on.

17:06.832 --> 17:08.298
You know what this dude needs?

17:08.300 --> 17:11.868
This dude needs
a partner.

17:11.870 --> 17:15.538
Think groller befriended jada
just because he was riding solo?

17:15.540 --> 17:17.339
Well, I think
we're social animals.

17:17.341 --> 17:19.908
Well... Most of us,

17:19.910 --> 17:21.876
Anyway.

17:21.878 --> 17:23.177
I'm social.

17:23.179 --> 17:24.111
You're social?

17:24.113 --> 17:25.846
I am. I'm just picky.

17:25.848 --> 17:27.080
(laughs):
Okay.

17:27.082 --> 17:29.015
You're not buying that?
No, I buy

17:29.017 --> 17:32.018
That in this moment that you...
<i> Believe</i> that you're social.

17:32.020 --> 17:34.253
What the hell do you know?
We don't even hang out.

17:34.255 --> 17:36.054
I'd totally hang out with you.

17:36.056 --> 17:38.356
You want to hang out?
Yeah. What are you doing
this weekend?

17:38.358 --> 17:40.024
(chuckles):
I have no idea.

17:40.026 --> 17:41.558
We should go grab beers--
we can do,

17:41.560 --> 17:43.927
Like, a guys' night.

17:43.929 --> 17:45.495
All right. Could work,

17:45.497 --> 17:46.863
I suppose.

17:46.865 --> 17:48.631
"could" and "suppose"?
I got to check

17:48.633 --> 17:51.166
My schedule, guy.
Oh, that's right,
'cause you're so picky.

17:51.168 --> 17:53.135
What are you gonna
be doing this time?

17:53.136 --> 17:55.103
Just gonna be, like, staring
at the ocean, like, smoldering?

17:55.105 --> 17:57.105
Like, what could you
possibly have plans for?

17:57.107 --> 17:59.440
Well, I<i> may</i> smolder.
(laughs)

18:01.043 --> 18:02.609
(shutter clicks)
here we go.

18:04.579 --> 18:07.345
(shutter clicking)

18:10.016 --> 18:13.050
Upload those to ops.
On it.

18:13.052 --> 18:15.285
Nell:
His name is wayne morris.

18:15.287 --> 18:16.519
Interpol has had

18:16.521 --> 18:19.255
A file on him since 2007.

18:19.257 --> 18:21.357
Says here he specializes
in money laundering

18:21.359 --> 18:23.392
For criminal
organizations.

18:23.394 --> 18:26.294
Among them, the molina cartel
and tahir khaled's regime

18:26.296 --> 18:27.628
In sudan.

18:27.630 --> 18:29.930
Maybe the marshal's not
as clean as we thought.

18:29.932 --> 18:31.464
If we take down
these guys now,

18:31.466 --> 18:33.165
There's no guarantee
they'll confess everything

18:33.167 --> 18:34.666
They know about jada.

18:34.668 --> 18:37.068
We're leaving him in play.

18:37.070 --> 18:38.636
All right, we've gotten
morris's vehicle tagged.

18:41.207 --> 18:43.373
There goes morris.
All right,

18:43.375 --> 18:45.174
Where's groller going now?

18:45.176 --> 18:47.442
Hold on.
His cell phone signal indicates

18:47.444 --> 18:49.010
He's still at the cafe.

18:49.012 --> 18:50.311
He ditched his phone.

18:50.313 --> 18:52.446
Groller's going dark, eric.

18:52.448 --> 18:54.247
His car is still

18:54.249 --> 18:56.215
Right where he parked it--
there's no sign of him.

18:56.217 --> 18:57.649
He has
countersurveillance training.

18:57.651 --> 18:59.384
Do not let him disappear.

18:59.386 --> 19:01.085
Checking traffic cams
in the area.

19:02.955 --> 19:04.454
(quietly):
Damn it.

19:04.456 --> 19:06.189
He's gone.

19:11.028 --> 19:12.527
Check out that cabana.

19:14.998 --> 19:16.530
Exclusive.

19:16.532 --> 19:18.999
More security than
the rest of the party.

19:19.001 --> 19:21.234
Think alex molina's one of them?

19:21.236 --> 19:23.336
I don't know-- but I'm
more interested in that guy

19:23.338 --> 19:25.671
Who's not having any fun.

19:25.673 --> 19:29.141
Talia:
Nuclear-grade party foul.

19:29.143 --> 19:32.043
Want to take
a closer look?
Mm-hmm.

19:32.045 --> 19:34.245
¶ ¶

19:35.181 --> 19:37.181
Sorry, sweetheart.
Just looking

19:37.183 --> 19:40.350
For some shade.
Oh, come on, manny,
don't do us like that.

19:40.352 --> 19:44.187
It ain't gonna happen, talia.
Talia: Okay.

19:44.189 --> 19:45.221
Oh.

19:45.223 --> 19:46.589
I heard

19:46.591 --> 19:47.656
You were looking for me.

19:50.260 --> 19:52.994
Well, that depends
on who<i> you</i> are.

19:52.996 --> 19:54.061
Alex molina.

19:54.063 --> 19:55.729
Talia.

19:55.731 --> 19:58.598
I have to admit,
I was looking for you.

20:00.301 --> 20:02.534
Then let's satisfy
your curiosity.

20:02.536 --> 20:04.602
Yes.

20:09.542 --> 20:11.308
(shutter clicking)

20:11.310 --> 20:13.109
Hi.

20:13.111 --> 20:15.144
How's it going?

20:15.146 --> 20:16.612
Whatcha doing?

20:19.617 --> 20:21.350
Working?

20:26.489 --> 20:29.223
It's a party.
I want to dance.

20:29.225 --> 20:31.291
He don't speak english.

20:31.293 --> 20:34.127
There's plenty of other guys
in here, kensi.

20:47.709 --> 20:49.575
Hey, get off him.

20:49.577 --> 20:53.245
Kensi: Didn't peg you for
the jealous type, manny.

20:53.247 --> 20:54.679
Hot chicks never listen.

20:54.681 --> 20:56.431
(kensi giggles)

20:56.432 --> 20:58.182
It's time for you to go.
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

20:58.184 --> 20:59.349
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Get off of me!

21:08.426 --> 21:09.691
Go.

21:11.695 --> 21:14.262
Walk it off, hombre.

21:15.064 --> 21:16.530
Man:
Go, go, go, go, go.

21:18.700 --> 21:21.333
You can be my plus one anytime.

21:21.335 --> 21:22.467
No, you can be mine.

21:22.469 --> 21:24.402
(laughs)

21:42.087 --> 21:46.422
Money guy, wayne morris...

21:46.424 --> 21:49.491
Who works for the molinas
and, uh, tahir khaled.

21:51.461 --> 21:53.527
Tell me about him.

22:06.641 --> 22:08.641
Morris hired us.

22:08.643 --> 22:12.311
He knew tahir khaled wanted
his sister returned to him

22:12.313 --> 22:14.646
Before she disappeared
into witness protection.

22:14.648 --> 22:16.547
Why?
I don't know.

22:18.150 --> 22:20.350
Our instructions were
to take her alive.

22:21.820 --> 22:24.153
So tahir khaled could kill her
with his own hands?

22:24.155 --> 22:25.487
I said
I don't know.

22:25.489 --> 22:26.488
And I don't care either.

22:26.490 --> 22:27.522
A job's a job.

22:32.828 --> 22:34.694
So it doesn't seem
like the molinas know

22:34.696 --> 22:35.828
Where jada is yet either,

22:35.830 --> 22:37.129
But there was a
guy at the party

22:37.131 --> 22:39.464
With a laptop who
was putting together

22:39.466 --> 22:41.799
What looked like a
search strategy for her.

22:41.801 --> 22:44.201
What, is that tech support
for the hit squad?

22:44.203 --> 22:45.368
Well, I put a gps
tracker on him.

22:45.370 --> 22:46.602
He hasn't left
the mansion yet.

22:46.604 --> 22:47.836
Well, he's probably laying low

22:47.838 --> 22:49.504
Now that he knows
we're on to him.

22:49.506 --> 22:51.172
Well, we got our first clean
look at alex molina.

22:51.174 --> 22:53.174
Which means
an ncis-dea task force

22:53.176 --> 22:55.843
Will keep an eye on him
from this point forward.

22:55.845 --> 22:57.244
Wow.

22:57.246 --> 22:58.445
Hey, guy?

22:58.447 --> 22:59.779
Mm-hmm.

22:59.781 --> 23:01.781
Can we take a moment
of silence to appreciate

23:01.783 --> 23:03.616
The awesomeness that's happening
right behind that screen?

23:03.618 --> 23:05.384
Callen:
Yeah, guy, we can.

23:05.386 --> 23:07.319
But we still don't know
groller's motivation.

23:07.321 --> 23:10.655
His field office did confirm
that he had gone dark.

23:10.657 --> 23:13.658
Which means, for the time being,
we're left with wayne morris.

23:13.660 --> 23:16.193
And sam said
that morris is the one

23:16.195 --> 23:17.661
That is financially and
logistically responsible

23:17.662 --> 23:19.128
For kidnapping jada
and getting her to sudan.

23:19.131 --> 23:21.197
Do we know where
morris is now?

23:21.199 --> 23:22.999
Nell:
Yes, we do.

23:23.000 --> 23:24.800
Taking the day off
from work apparently.

23:24.802 --> 23:27.135
He just bought a movie
theater ticket online

23:27.137 --> 23:29.537
From the vista
theatre in hollywood.

23:29.539 --> 23:31.539
Not exactly what I'd be doing if
I was planning a snatch and grab

23:31.541 --> 23:33.641
On a sudanese warlord's
little sister.

23:33.643 --> 23:35.242
He's using the theater as cover.

23:35.244 --> 23:36.710
Could be
for a dead drop,

23:36.712 --> 23:39.612
Could be a rendezvous with the
molina hit squad or groller.

23:39.614 --> 23:41.464
Either way, we should be there.

23:41.465 --> 23:43.315
Well, I would get there fast--
the show starts soon.

23:49.523 --> 23:51.689
Sam: So you've never been
in a military.

23:53.292 --> 23:55.692
But you ran special ops
for the molina cartel.

23:59.664 --> 24:02.197
Where'd you pick up
those skills, salazar?

24:02.199 --> 24:06.201
The cartel has plenty
of ex-operators on the payroll.

24:06.203 --> 24:08.336
They train us down in sinaloa.

24:08.338 --> 24:10.738
Some of us since we
were very young.

24:10.740 --> 24:13.273
So you're, like, the student
who surpassed his teacher.

24:13.275 --> 24:14.674
Is that it?

24:14.676 --> 24:17.276
Some men are leaders,
some are followers.

24:18.345 --> 24:19.811
Explain that.

24:19.813 --> 24:24.482
It takes more than a trust fund
and a college degree

24:24.484 --> 24:27.251
To run a business.

24:27.253 --> 24:28.385
Men may follow leaders
like that,

24:28.387 --> 24:29.753
But they do not respect them.

24:29.755 --> 24:32.288
Ah. You're talking
about alex molina.

24:33.924 --> 24:36.257
His reputation precedes him.

24:36.259 --> 24:38.592
You may be joining him
in a cell soon.

24:38.594 --> 24:43.229
Ncis and dea both have eyes
on him for the first time.

24:43.231 --> 24:44.830
Full surveillance package.

24:44.832 --> 24:46.615
No, no, no, no, no.

24:46.616 --> 24:48.399
See, arturo molina's
eldest son and heir

24:48.402 --> 24:50.435
Won't be doing time in prison.

24:50.437 --> 24:52.303
Oh, no?
No, no.

24:52.305 --> 24:54.305
No, see...

24:54.307 --> 24:56.707
That's not the way
the world works, my friend.

24:56.709 --> 24:59.342
The privileged get

24:59.344 --> 25:02.945
A slap on the wrist and keep
doing what they were born to do.

25:02.947 --> 25:05.280
That's not going to change
anytime soon.

25:05.282 --> 25:07.749
You know it; I know it.

25:08.718 --> 25:10.250
Well...

25:10.252 --> 25:12.452
That's all
the more reason for...

25:12.454 --> 25:14.554
You to keep talking to me.

25:14.556 --> 25:18.324
Oh, I think I've been
pretty vocal already.

25:18.326 --> 25:20.359
What haven't you told me?
What haven't you told<i> me?</i>

25:22.296 --> 25:25.397
You know, tahir khaled gave
me and my team background

25:25.399 --> 25:29.267
On ncis
and jada khaled, right?

25:29.269 --> 25:31.736
I know what you did to her.

25:31.738 --> 25:34.371
You lured her into falling
in love with your lies,

25:34.373 --> 25:35.505
And then you just

25:35.507 --> 25:37.906
Tore her life apart
without remorse.

25:41.578 --> 25:45.413
You don't know the first thing
about me and jada.
Oh, no, no, no.

25:45.415 --> 25:48.349
I-I respect what you did.

25:48.351 --> 25:50.517
See, you...

25:50.519 --> 25:52.952
You are a true professional.

25:52.954 --> 25:55.354
You know,
a man who accepts a mission

25:55.356 --> 25:58.256
And sees it through
till the very end.
Don't say it.

25:58.258 --> 25:59.991
A man just like me.

25:59.993 --> 26:02.259
Mr. Hanna.

26:13.371 --> 26:15.371
(door closes)

26:25.048 --> 26:26.547
Morris just arrived.

26:26.549 --> 26:28.448
He just walked
into the theater lobby.

26:30.885 --> 26:32.985
He's walking
through the lobby now.

26:35.356 --> 26:36.822
Callen (over radio):
I have not seen groller

26:36.824 --> 26:38.490
Or anyone else
who matches the description

26:38.492 --> 26:40.658
Of the molina hit squad, either.

26:40.660 --> 26:42.426
I'm going in.

26:42.428 --> 26:44.027
I'll have
a small popcorn.

26:44.029 --> 26:45.495
Callen:
Morris just took a seat

26:45.497 --> 26:47.330
In the fifth row.

26:47.332 --> 26:49.632
He's front and center.

26:49.634 --> 26:51.934
(dramatic music playing
on film soundtrack)

26:51.936 --> 26:54.603
And there's no one near him.

26:54.605 --> 26:57.339
¶ ¶

27:01.345 --> 27:03.478
Deeks:
Who the hell is that?

27:03.480 --> 27:05.546
Kensi:
He must have been here already.

27:05.548 --> 27:07.614
Callen: Morris just
handed something off.

27:07.616 --> 27:11.651
Callen: I got the guy
in the hoodie. Take morris.

27:18.792 --> 27:20.825
Deeks:
Lapd. Hold it right there.

27:20.827 --> 27:23.360
Federal agent!

27:27.932 --> 27:30.098
Are you really going
to shoot me,

27:30.100 --> 27:32.399
Agent callen?

27:35.670 --> 27:36.702
Go.

27:36.704 --> 27:37.836
Go!

27:56.722 --> 27:58.922
All right, morris,
tell him what you told us.

27:58.924 --> 28:02.892
I've known jada khaled
since she was a little girl.

28:02.894 --> 28:04.960
So you admit you've been
doing business with a warlord

28:04.962 --> 28:06.962
For over 20 years?
Baseless accusation

28:06.964 --> 28:10.565
That will be addressed
once you speak to my attorneys.

28:10.567 --> 28:11.766
My corporation

28:11.768 --> 28:13.868
Is a show of good faith.
You need
to cooperate

28:13.870 --> 28:15.769
Faster, morris.
Tahir doesn't care

28:15.771 --> 28:17.837
That jada testified
against him.

28:17.839 --> 28:19.872
He's a ruthless warlord

28:19.874 --> 28:21.773
Who's going to keep on doing
what he's doing

28:21.775 --> 28:23.674
Until someone else
more ruthless stops him.

28:23.676 --> 28:26.443
In the meantime, he just wants
to see his little sister again.

28:26.445 --> 28:28.745
Oh, what, so this is all
about tahir trying to have

28:28.747 --> 28:31.814
A little family
reunion with jada?
Ultimately, yes.

28:31.816 --> 28:33.148
And you might be
interested to know

28:33.150 --> 28:35.016
That she wants
exactly the same thing.

28:36.019 --> 28:38.719
Well, is it that farfetched
to think that...

28:38.721 --> 28:41.388
A brother and a sister who are
the only surviving members

28:41.390 --> 28:43.156
Of their family
could forgive each other?

28:43.158 --> 28:46.659
Tell me what happened
after the ambush this morning.
Jada called me

28:46.661 --> 28:50.062
On a burn phone and wanted
to know if tahir was involved.

28:50.064 --> 28:53.765
I told her that he...
He wanted to bring her home,

28:53.767 --> 28:56.667
Put the past
behind them.

28:56.669 --> 28:59.803
She was understandably
skeptical, and convinced

28:59.805 --> 29:01.938
That guy groller
to vet me in person.

29:01.940 --> 29:03.439
Kensi:
So jada was the one
who called groller

29:03.441 --> 29:05.107
On the burn phone
after the ambush--

29:05.109 --> 29:06.808
She called
the only friend she had.

29:06.810 --> 29:09.844
Why did she meet you here?
So I could give her

29:09.846 --> 29:11.178
A forged passport.

29:12.447 --> 29:13.546
The molina cartel are

29:13.548 --> 29:15.047
Getting her
out of the country today

29:15.049 --> 29:17.115
On a private jet.

29:17.117 --> 29:20.918
You just sent jada to her death.

29:20.920 --> 29:22.886
Sam:
I don't buy it.

29:22.888 --> 29:24.621
I spent enough time around tahir

29:24.623 --> 29:26.823
To know the only thing
he wants to do

29:26.825 --> 29:28.925
Is torture and murder jada
for betraying him.

29:31.129 --> 29:34.196
It's not about revenge;
this is about honor.

29:35.799 --> 29:38.766
In that culture,
jada belongs to her brother.

29:38.768 --> 29:40.701
Killing her is the only way

29:40.703 --> 29:42.969
To restore
the family name.

29:42.971 --> 29:46.872
Yes, but the only way
<i> you</i> can save her life

29:46.874 --> 29:49.474
Is by forbidding her
to return home.

29:49.476 --> 29:53.044
And that... That's like
imprisoning a woman

29:53.046 --> 29:55.846
Because you believe
that you know her brother

29:55.848 --> 29:57.180
Better than she does.

29:57.182 --> 30:01.150
Jada is dead the minute
she steps foot in sudan.

30:01.152 --> 30:04.219
Come on, hetty,
you know that
as well as I do.

30:04.221 --> 30:05.853
Perhaps...

30:05.855 --> 30:08.755
But I'm afraid
that jada's opinion

30:08.757 --> 30:11.858
Is the only one
that matters.

30:16.931 --> 30:19.064
Then I'll get proof.

30:26.640 --> 30:30.575
...After the first
lie I told her.

30:30.577 --> 30:34.478
She didn't know my
real name back then.

30:34.480 --> 30:37.647
She didn't know I was
gonna destroy her life.

30:39.617 --> 30:42.250
But something inside of her
told her to believe me.

30:42.252 --> 30:44.518
That's where it started.

30:44.520 --> 30:46.186
A pact of honor.

30:46.188 --> 30:48.188
An unspoken
agreement...

30:48.190 --> 30:52.825
That I would take on a burden
that wasn't part of my mission.

30:52.827 --> 30:56.061
It was just
the right thing to do.
And now

30:56.063 --> 30:58.663
You come here to engage me
in one of these agreements.

30:58.665 --> 30:59.797
If she goes back

30:59.799 --> 31:02.666
To sudan, she'll die.

31:02.668 --> 31:04.034
You know that.

31:04.036 --> 31:05.802
No.

31:05.804 --> 31:07.570
No, I-I don't.

31:07.572 --> 31:10.039
You just want me
to agree with you

31:10.041 --> 31:11.907
So you'll feel better

31:11.909 --> 31:14.743
About forcing this woman
to spend the rest of her life

31:14.745 --> 31:17.011
In a place
she doesn't want to be.

31:17.013 --> 31:19.880
You didn't come here
to strike a pact of honor.

31:19.882 --> 31:23.149
You came here
to get my permission.
I came to get the truth.

31:23.151 --> 31:25.117
The truth is...

31:25.119 --> 31:29.287
No one knows what will happen
to jada if she returns to sudan.

31:30.757 --> 31:33.190
Perhaps tahir himself
does not know.

31:33.192 --> 31:37.527
I mean, he may have
a plan, but...

31:37.529 --> 31:40.663
That plan may change
once he sees her face

31:40.665 --> 31:44.099
For the first time
after all these years.

31:44.101 --> 31:47.235
Who are you to say
what will happen in that moment?

31:47.237 --> 31:50.271
If she dies...

31:50.273 --> 31:52.873
Part of me will die with her.

31:54.676 --> 31:57.009
Do you understand what
I'm saying to you?

31:57.011 --> 31:58.710
Mm-hmm.

31:58.712 --> 32:01.946
A part of my soul will go dark.

32:01.948 --> 32:05.950
I will do brutal and unspeakable
things to people.

32:05.952 --> 32:07.818
Is that all?

32:09.221 --> 32:13.723
It's not so bad here in the land
of the brutal, my friend.

32:13.725 --> 32:17.660
I'll be sure to give you
a warm welcome when you arrive.

32:25.335 --> 32:27.268
All right.

32:27.270 --> 32:29.903
I see how it is.
See how what is?

32:29.905 --> 32:32.205
You turned this into
a guy-versus-girls thing.

32:32.207 --> 32:34.006
What? Deeks...
This whole thing

32:34.008 --> 32:36.975
Is an elaborate ruse to resume
the great psb debate

32:36.977 --> 32:38.977
With another ladybird
in the room.

32:38.979 --> 32:40.712
And by "this whole thing,"

32:40.714 --> 32:43.114
Do you mean
the molina ambush, jada,

32:43.116 --> 32:45.082
Or what'll go down when
she gets on that plane?

32:45.084 --> 32:47.784
Talia, how do you feel about
being roped into our little
gender war here?

32:47.786 --> 32:50.586
For the record, this is not
a war and I'm not on his side.

32:50.588 --> 32:52.087
What's a psb?

32:52.089 --> 32:54.122
Deeks:
It's this evil lady that
double-parks and blocks kensi

32:54.124 --> 32:56.090
Into the starbucks.
Wait.

32:56.092 --> 32:57.658
You've got a parking
spot bitch, too?

32:57.660 --> 32:59.893
Kensi: Yes.
Oh, my god,
do I hate psb's.

32:59.895 --> 33:01.661
Yes!
Do you want
to talk about it?

33:01.663 --> 33:03.162
Yes.
Girl, I'm here for you.

33:03.164 --> 33:05.330
Thank you.
Deeks: Okay, the only
thing that proves

33:05.332 --> 33:08.099
Is that you're both unhinged.
Am I right, callen?

33:08.101 --> 33:11.001
Still not taking sides.
Aw, come on, man,
this is supposed

33:11.003 --> 33:13.003
To be us versus them;
conquer and divide--

33:13.005 --> 33:15.271
This is
what they want.
The molinas are moving.

33:15.273 --> 33:17.740
Alex and the guy kensi tagged
are headed for an airstrip

33:17.742 --> 33:19.341
In van nuys.
Callen:
Flight manifests?

33:19.343 --> 33:22.110
There's a private charter jet
scheduled to leave in an hour.

33:22.112 --> 33:24.078
Let's move. Fast.

33:27.249 --> 33:29.315
¶ ¶

33:37.658 --> 33:41.192
All right, you're looking at the
entire molina entourage, guys.

33:41.194 --> 33:43.160
No vehicles
coming or going.

33:43.162 --> 33:45.162
Hold your position,
callen.

33:45.164 --> 33:46.897
Granger: Let's see
what jada really wants.

33:46.899 --> 33:49.099
Okay, got it.

34:01.112 --> 34:02.811
Out of the car.

34:02.813 --> 34:04.212
Don't fire until I clear you.

34:04.214 --> 34:06.747
Roger that.
Just say the word.

34:06.749 --> 34:08.715
Callen:
Looks like groller
got himself caught

34:08.717 --> 34:11.084
In the middle
of jada and the cartel.

34:12.821 --> 34:14.954
Time to go home.

34:16.190 --> 34:18.256
What is going to
happen to you now?

34:19.759 --> 34:22.159
Don't worry
about me, jada.

34:28.199 --> 34:29.865
Damn it, jada.

34:34.871 --> 34:36.770
Callen:
Groller!

34:36.772 --> 34:37.670
Granger:
Groller's down!

34:37.672 --> 34:38.437
Move in now.

34:45.078 --> 34:47.745
Callen: I got alex. Do not
let jada get on that plane.

34:49.448 --> 34:50.914
(yells)

34:56.420 --> 34:59.220
Callen:
He's still breathing.
I got us covered.

34:59.222 --> 35:00.387
Alex.

35:00.389 --> 35:01.855
Look at me.

35:01.857 --> 35:05.258
What is tahir really
gonna do with jada?

35:05.260 --> 35:09.195
Do the right thing, alex.
You tell me the truth.

35:09.197 --> 35:11.263
Stay with me, alex.

35:11.265 --> 35:13.932
What is tahir
gonna do with jada?

35:13.934 --> 35:16.000
(labored breathing)

35:16.002 --> 35:18.869
I'm not alex molina.

35:23.141 --> 35:24.273
(phone vibrating)

35:24.275 --> 35:26.174
That is your team
calling you.

35:26.176 --> 35:28.209
They're going to tell you that

35:28.211 --> 35:31.111
Jada is boarding her plane now.

35:31.113 --> 35:34.848
There is nothing
you can do anymore.

35:34.850 --> 35:36.783
You did all you could.

35:36.785 --> 35:38.851
I was right.

35:40.154 --> 35:43.255
When jada arrives in sudan,

35:43.257 --> 35:47.025
Tahir is going to welcome her
with open arms.

35:48.261 --> 35:52.963
He's going to throw a feast
in her honor that same night.

35:52.965 --> 35:55.031
And then a few hours later,

35:55.033 --> 35:58.200
After his morning prayer...

35:58.202 --> 36:01.936
He is going
to torture her to death.

36:03.339 --> 36:06.273
I'm so sorry.
How do you know?

36:08.043 --> 36:10.943
Because tahir told me himself.

36:10.945 --> 36:13.512
You're alex molina.

36:15.482 --> 36:18.316
It's nice to meet you,
my friend.

36:35.101 --> 36:36.233
(grunts)

36:36.868 --> 36:37.967
Federal agents!

36:38.936 --> 36:40.201
Do not move.

36:41.170 --> 36:43.170
Jada:
Enough.

36:43.172 --> 36:45.272
Enough!

36:45.274 --> 36:47.173
I have done
everything

36:47.175 --> 36:49.175
Ncis has asked of me.

36:49.177 --> 36:51.010
I accepted

36:51.012 --> 36:54.179
That sam had to make
impossible choices.

36:54.181 --> 36:56.881
Please let me go home now.

36:56.883 --> 36:59.016
Tahir is gonna kill you, jada.

36:59.018 --> 37:00.150
You do not know

37:00.152 --> 37:02.285
My brother as I do.

37:02.287 --> 37:04.920
He only wants
his family back.

37:04.922 --> 37:07.289
My brother will not harm me.

37:07.291 --> 37:09.291
No, you're wrong.

37:09.293 --> 37:11.126
What proof do you have of this?

37:16.032 --> 37:19.233
(line ringing)

37:23.305 --> 37:25.404
Sam:
It's me.

37:27.441 --> 37:28.540
Sam.

37:28.542 --> 37:30.308
Jada, listen to me.

37:30.310 --> 37:32.343
Don't get on that plane.

37:32.345 --> 37:35.346
I'll never ask you
for anything else, ever.

37:35.348 --> 37:38.315
Just don't go back to sudan.

37:38.317 --> 37:40.950
I'm tired, sam.

37:41.919 --> 37:43.852
I want my life back.

37:43.854 --> 37:46.120
I'll help you start a new life.

37:46.122 --> 37:48.355
But I want<i> my</i> life back.

37:48.357 --> 37:50.924
I don't want to be

37:50.926 --> 37:52.892
In some lonely place
where they have

37:52.894 --> 37:55.895
1,000 types of cheese
and skiing.

37:55.897 --> 37:58.197
Your brother
is going to kill you.

38:00.467 --> 38:03.367
I was ready to begin
a new life with you.

38:04.336 --> 38:07.437
You remember?

38:07.439 --> 38:09.238
It was all lies.

38:09.240 --> 38:12.040
So perhaps if there was
anyone else on this phone,

38:12.042 --> 38:13.508
I would believe them.

38:13.510 --> 38:15.243
Why would I lie about this?

38:15.245 --> 38:18.112
Because it is what you do.

38:18.114 --> 38:19.947
You're an undercover agent.

38:19.949 --> 38:21.281
It is your job.

38:21.283 --> 38:23.483
Good-bye.
Jada... Listen...

38:23.485 --> 38:25.151
Jada!

38:25.153 --> 38:25.885
(click)

38:30.458 --> 38:35.093
After everything
I have done for ncis...

38:35.095 --> 38:37.494
Will you force me to stay?

38:39.197 --> 38:41.530
No.

38:41.532 --> 38:43.598
Then this is my choice.

38:57.313 --> 38:59.379
(engines whirring)

38:59.381 --> 39:02.348
Gps tracker we put
on molina's guy still active?

39:02.350 --> 39:04.416
Yeah, we got him.
The signal's strong.

39:04.418 --> 39:06.217
The moment this plane lands

39:06.219 --> 39:09.453
Anywhere in the world,
we'll know.

39:09.455 --> 39:12.489
I'll brief secnav now.

39:27.671 --> 39:31.472
I told you...
Arturo molina's eldest son

39:31.474 --> 39:34.007
Wouldn't be spending much time
in prison, remember?

39:34.009 --> 39:37.377
Our family's lawyers have
already drawn up a deal

39:37.379 --> 39:41.414
That'll be too tempting
for your agency to turn down.

39:41.416 --> 39:43.182
You should've
taken me up

39:43.184 --> 39:45.417
On that pact of honor
when I offered it to you.

39:45.419 --> 39:49.421
Jada's gone, and this is
when your soul turns dark, huh?

39:49.423 --> 39:50.955
(chuckles)

39:50.957 --> 39:52.990
I'll be sure to look for you

39:52.992 --> 39:55.125
In the land of the brutal,
my friend.

39:55.127 --> 39:58.695
By the time you see me,
it'll be too late.

40:17.348 --> 40:19.381
Jada didn't believe me, hetty.

40:19.383 --> 40:21.583
The lies
caught up with me.

40:21.585 --> 40:23.952
I told her the truth.

40:23.954 --> 40:26.120
It didn't make a difference.

40:26.122 --> 40:28.322
Jada...

40:28.324 --> 40:31.558
Decided to get
on that plane to sudan

40:31.560 --> 40:33.393
Long before today.

40:33.395 --> 40:36.396
In fact,
some would say

40:36.398 --> 40:39.499
She made that choice years ago.

40:39.501 --> 40:43.369
Yeah, the day I decided
to tell her who I am.

40:43.371 --> 40:45.504
And who I'm not.

40:45.506 --> 40:49.407
I know it doesn't feel
like it now, sam...

40:49.409 --> 40:53.277
But you did...
Excellent work today.

40:53.279 --> 40:55.412
And thanks to you,
we've learned

40:55.414 --> 40:58.314
That the molina cartel's
future kingpin

40:58.316 --> 41:00.449
Is in our custody.

41:00.451 --> 41:04.553
And what happens to jada,
only time will tell.

41:14.063 --> 41:16.063
Nice having you around, talia.

41:16.065 --> 41:18.131
You know, we should
hang out sometime.

41:19.100 --> 41:20.399
Yeah?
Yeah.

41:20.401 --> 41:23.468
Go to a clippers game,
grab some beer.

41:23.470 --> 41:25.086
Mm...

41:25.087 --> 41:26.703
Rockets are in town
this weekend.
Yeah?

41:26.706 --> 41:28.405
What is happening here?
I'm usually the object

41:28.407 --> 41:32.008
Of your inappropriate
work-space attention.
And, you,

41:32.010 --> 41:33.342
I thought<i> we</i> had
plans this weekend.

41:33.344 --> 41:36.111
This is exactly why I didn't
commit to you, deeks.

41:36.113 --> 41:38.146
I'll think about it.
You should.

41:38.148 --> 41:39.347
Mm.
What...

41:39.349 --> 41:40.514
What about me?

41:40.516 --> 41:42.115
Okay, settle down, deeks.

41:42.117 --> 41:44.450
He's obviously a social guy;
you should cut him some slack.

41:44.452 --> 41:46.185
Callen always has plans.
Yeah, what,

41:46.187 --> 41:47.753
To stare at the ocean
and smolder?

41:47.755 --> 41:50.422
Mm.
You<i> do</i> give a good smolder.

41:50.424 --> 41:51.423
Thank you.

41:51.425 --> 41:53.008
Oh!
Kensi:
Okay.

41:53.009 --> 41:54.592
Good night, deeks.
Wait, where are
you guys going?

41:54.594 --> 41:56.694
I'm gonna go crush
copious amounts of ice cream

41:56.696 --> 41:59.463
With females only.
Females only.

41:59.465 --> 42:02.299
I'm sorry. Who's gonna sit
here and listen to me vent?

42:02.301 --> 42:03.500
Talia:
Not us.
Good night, deeks.

42:03.502 --> 42:05.635
Wait, I got a solution.
How about tonight?

42:05.637 --> 42:08.804
What about tonight?
You and I go grab
beers tonight.

42:08.806 --> 42:11.640
Guy, I told you,
I need to think about that.
Think about what?

42:11.642 --> 42:13.608
Tonight is happening
right now.

42:13.610 --> 42:15.042
We are on this
ride together.

42:15.044 --> 42:16.710
And I know the place,
the perfect place. Okay.

42:16.712 --> 42:18.623
Really?
Yeah, right around
the corner,

42:18.624 --> 42:20.535
And they got a happy hour
for another two hours,

42:20.536 --> 42:22.447
And they got craft beers--
do you like craft beers?
<i> Love</i> craft beers.

42:22.451 --> 42:24.551
Well, they got craft beers,
and they got jalapeno poppers,

42:24.553 --> 42:27.420
Potato skins, they got, uh...
Oh, the mozzarella stick.

42:27.422 --> 42:29.388
That's the trifecta--
you can't turn down

42:29.390 --> 42:30.589
The trifecta, 'cause you...

42:30.591 --> 42:32.457
Callen?

42:32.459 --> 42:35.193
We're-we're just
gonna meet there?

42:35.195 --> 42:38.696
All right, I'll just, I'll just
text you the address.

42:38.698 --> 42:40.664
Callen?

42:40.666 --> 42:42.432
