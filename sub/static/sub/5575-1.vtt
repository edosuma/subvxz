00:19.000 --> 00:21.233
So how much do your parents pay?

00:21.333 --> 00:23.233
- I don't know.
- Of course you do.

00:23.333 --> 00:24.859
I don't.

00:24.975 --> 00:28.509
- I bet it's worth more than my house.
- I bet it's not.

00:28.625 --> 00:30.050
Look, I'm not posh.

00:30.150 --> 00:34.009
- You're so posh!
- I'm not. I'm just well-educated.

00:35.375 --> 00:37.727
And all that education,

00:38.127 --> 00:39.833
where's that gonna go?

00:39.933 --> 00:43.108
What about you? Did you learn anything
apart from your... gymnastics stuff?

00:43.208 --> 00:46.483
Yeah, but... you don't get it.

00:46.583 --> 00:49.342
I've to get up at 5:00 every morning,
train for two hours...

00:49.458 --> 00:54.609
Fuck me! I couldn't do that.
I need my beauty sleep.

00:54.725 --> 00:58.042
Yeah, well, I fall asleep
in school a lot.

01:01.133 --> 01:03.092
- I can't touch that.
- Seriously?

01:03.208 --> 01:06.409
Nope. Can't drink, I can't smoke.

01:06.517 --> 01:08.584
I'm really boring.

01:10.117 --> 01:12.208
- I bought it back in pieces from France.
- Right.

01:12.308 --> 01:14.817
One of these babies can go
right through a man.

01:14.917 --> 01:16.967
- Mark!
- You wanna see it work?

01:17.083 --> 01:18.767
- Really?
- Yeah, you do.

01:18.867 --> 01:22.384
You put it down like this,
you hoist this thing up...

01:22.783 --> 01:25.192
put it back down like that...

01:25.292 --> 01:27.317
you take your arrow...

01:27.417 --> 01:29.642
just lock it in here...

01:29.742 --> 01:31.817
- And you're good to go.
- All right.

01:31.917 --> 01:32.983
- You wanna go?
- No.

01:33.083 --> 01:36.064
- Are you sure? Are you sure? Just take it.
- Mark, stop! I really don't wanna go.

01:36.164 --> 01:39.049
- Mark!
- Just take... Fuck!

01:39.149 --> 01:40.714
Fuck! I'm sorry.

01:40.814 --> 01:43.134
- Oh, my God!
- Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck...

05:40.291 --> 05:42.833
- What's going on with your phone?
- My mum took it.

05:42.933 --> 05:45.950
- Why? Why? What's happened?
- Come in, I'll explain. Be quiet.

05:47.731 --> 05:50.575
- This place is amazing.
- You'd be a natural housebreaker.

05:50.691 --> 05:53.508
Maybe that's what I should do
with my life.

05:54.491 --> 05:56.216
- Oh, fuck!
- You're such a dickhead.

05:56.316 --> 05:59.875
It's fine, it's fine.
It'll pass in a sec.

06:00.833 --> 06:03.383
It doesn't happen as much as it used to.

06:34.124 --> 06:36.050
Happy birthday.

06:36.674 --> 06:38.275
Thanks.

06:42.099 --> 06:44.164
That's really sweet.

06:44.708 --> 06:47.233
Can't believe you haven't been
in here before.

06:47.376 --> 06:50.407
- Looks like it could do with a woman's touch.
- Well, I could do with a woman's touch.

06:50.507 --> 06:52.199
Mark...

06:52.299 --> 06:55.850
- I need to talk to you about something.
- In a bit.

07:11.083 --> 07:13.758
So, what happened?

07:14.108 --> 07:17.333
My mum was doing the laundry,
and she found a wrap in my pocket.

07:17.533 --> 07:22.083
She's gone absolutely nuts.
Won't even let me out of the house now.

07:22.183 --> 07:24.828
"You've abused our trust.
What have you become?"

07:24.928 --> 07:28.542
Blah, blah, blah...
Why do you look so pleased?

07:29.058 --> 07:31.802
I thought you weren't answering
'cause you didn't want to talk to me.

07:31.902 --> 07:35.675
I thought I'd been dumped.
I must have rang you about 50 times.

07:35.791 --> 07:37.683
Shift was a bloody nightmare.

08:06.283 --> 08:08.533
Hang on. Just a second.

08:11.724 --> 08:13.358
Mark! Mark!

08:31.058 --> 08:34.442
- Have you been smoking?
- It's just a joss stick.

08:34.749 --> 08:37.357
Look, we're not monsters.
You'll need this to do your homework.

08:37.474 --> 08:39.875
Can I have my phone back, please?

08:41.416 --> 08:43.376
From Kelly?

08:44.207 --> 08:45.967
Sweet.

08:46.866 --> 08:49.549
Look, I know you feel bad
about what happened, but that's...

08:49.649 --> 08:51.875
Give me back my phone!

08:52.182 --> 08:55.774
She stacks shelves in a supermarket.

08:55.874 --> 08:58.369
And that house is a shocking state.

08:58.469 --> 09:01.124
There's rubbish piled up
in a mattress rotting in the garden.

09:01.224 --> 09:05.334
- You went to her mum's house?
- A mother has a right to be concerned.

09:05.766 --> 09:09.207
- Does she give you the drugs?
- I gave them to her.

09:09.307 --> 09:11.857
None of this nonsense was going on
before she came on the scene.

09:11.957 --> 09:14.407
- A friend works at the social services...
- Mark...

09:14.507 --> 09:17.616
There's no sign of the bloody dog.
It must've run off again, jumped the fence.

09:17.916 --> 09:19.796
He won't come for us. Got to call him.

09:19.896 --> 09:22.707
The dog will be back by morning,
he always is.

09:22.807 --> 09:25.924
Mark and I were just discussing
his attitude.

09:26.024 --> 09:28.607
We've got to get the dog back.
We can't have him worrying sheep.

09:28.707 --> 09:31.838
I can't believe in circumstances
like these, with this crisis going on,

09:31.938 --> 09:34.831
you're concerned about sheep.

09:35.024 --> 09:38.783
- This is our son...
- Your son.

09:43.374 --> 09:46.379
I'll go take a walk
and shout for the dog.

09:47.174 --> 09:50.225
Go, I need a minute to get dressed.

09:59.041 --> 10:01.559
I haven't got a social worker.

10:01.832 --> 10:06.192
Just a family care adviser came 'round
a few times, 'cause of my mum's head.

10:07.016 --> 10:08.524
Look...

10:08.624 --> 10:10.807
- I'm gonna go. I'll see you tomorrow.
- Stay.

10:10.907 --> 10:13.717
No, I don't wanna get you
in any more trouble.

10:17.932 --> 10:21.125
- Mark.
- Stay.

10:21.916 --> 10:24.667
Please. Please stay.

10:24.782 --> 10:28.967
Look, it's my birthday tomorrow...
Please?

10:33.266 --> 10:35.657
Look, my mum will definitely be back
when I go out,

10:35.757 --> 10:38.699
so we should find you
a better hiding place.

10:38.999 --> 10:40.742
Mark!

14:05.165 --> 14:08.425
You've got a lot of crap in this bag.

14:09.250 --> 14:11.100
What's that?

14:13.499 --> 14:16.332
- Unlucky charm.
- Throw it away.

14:16.432 --> 14:19.582
- Kelly, you said you'd got rid of it. What...
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I will.

14:19.682 --> 14:24.599
- I'll get rid of it.
- Jesus! And people call me morbid.

14:25.865 --> 14:27.625
I'm sorry.

14:28.947 --> 14:30.792
I'm sorry.

14:31.665 --> 14:33.758
Want to go to bed?

14:57.790 --> 14:59.092
I'll tell you a secret.

15:00.774 --> 15:03.232
She's sleeping with a guy down the road.

15:03.332 --> 15:04.733
No.

15:05.390 --> 15:10.800
This one time I was halfway to school,
decided against it, came back and...

15:11.499 --> 15:13.624
there they were.

15:13.724 --> 15:15.083
At it.

15:19.915 --> 15:22.384
And you didn't tell your stepdad?

15:22.832 --> 15:24.490
I think he knows.

15:24.790 --> 15:28.833
I guess he's trying
to catch them at it or...

15:30.332 --> 15:32.950
So fucked up.

15:35.665 --> 15:38.099
South America then...

15:38.199 --> 15:39.767
Mexico.

15:40.490 --> 15:42.583
Guacamole.

15:43.765 --> 15:45.825
Guatemala.

15:46.673 --> 15:48.850
And then, Brazil.

15:49.215 --> 15:51.591
I was supposed to compete there.

15:52.398 --> 15:54.382
Rio it is, then.

15:54.482 --> 15:56.683
When should we leave?

15:57.007 --> 15:59.016
God, I'd love that.

16:41.673 --> 16:43.533
Mark...

16:44.565 --> 16:46.257
We weren't careful enough.

16:46.357 --> 16:49.590
I know. I can't believe my mom
found that wrapper in my pocket.

16:49.690 --> 16:51.800
No, not that.

16:55.773 --> 16:57.543
I'm pregnant.

17:29.198 --> 17:32.857
- There's no debate here.
- Why are you being like this?

17:32.957 --> 17:34.725
I need a fag.

17:35.090 --> 17:38.798
You'd have to give that up.
And everything else you like.

17:38.898 --> 17:41.032
Fine, I can do that.
I've done that before.

17:41.132 --> 17:45.694
I've got my whole life to think about...
I've got my future ahead of me.

17:46.898 --> 17:49.616
- What was that?
- Don't try and change the subject.

17:55.273 --> 17:57.423
Is it your mum?

17:57.523 --> 17:59.433
I don't think so.

18:01.945 --> 18:03.757
Mark...

18:03.857 --> 18:06.333
Mark, what are you doing?

18:07.773 --> 18:08.983
Don't.

18:10.298 --> 18:14.666
- Stay there.
- No. No, Mark, please. Don't leave me.

18:21.890 --> 18:24.175
Oi! Come here!

18:28.815 --> 18:30.465
Help him up!

18:30.565 --> 18:33.933
- I'm critically injured, man.
- Let's take him upstairs.

18:42.565 --> 18:45.116
I'm gonna deal with you later, boy!

18:52.398 --> 18:54.416
Help him up.

19:16.731 --> 19:19.965
Fuck, man! I need fucking...

19:20.065 --> 19:21.674
Fuck!

19:23.306 --> 19:25.448
Fuck! Fuck!

19:25.548 --> 19:27.508
Shit.

19:27.623 --> 19:29.140
Bandages.

19:29.240 --> 19:32.283
Come on, something.
Come on, fuck's sake!

19:38.098 --> 19:40.373
- We need to take it out.
- We need to leave it in.

19:40.473 --> 19:44.590
- Listen, why don't you leave it in?
- It's all right. Calm down.

19:44.690 --> 19:46.070
Focus.

19:49.356 --> 19:52.741
- I'm turning the fucking lights on.
- He said no lights.

19:53.106 --> 19:55.566
We need to see what we're doing.

20:02.781 --> 20:05.566
- Fuck!
- Jesus!

20:08.273 --> 20:10.033
Fuck!

20:12.148 --> 20:13.765
He needs a doctor.

20:13.865 --> 20:17.298
If we take him to the hospital,
we trash this entire plan.

20:17.398 --> 20:20.473
Don't talk rubbish.
Nobody's leaving. I've had worse.

20:20.773 --> 20:23.874
Now, do we have the family?

20:23.974 --> 20:26.306
Taped and tacked.
They're not going anywhere.

20:26.406 --> 20:28.756
They were all screaming
like a bunch of little girls.

20:28.856 --> 20:32.108
Let's be clear.
Nobody used any real names.

20:33.298 --> 20:34.990
- No, I don't think so.
- You better be sure.

20:35.090 --> 20:36.815
I don't think so.

20:36.915 --> 20:39.265
If they heard any names
we're gonna have to kill them.

20:39.365 --> 20:41.548
Look, I didn't use any, did you?

20:41.648 --> 20:43.006
- No.
- You sure?

20:43.106 --> 20:44.673
There were no names.

20:44.773 --> 20:47.731
Okay, we carry on. You two,
you do the business without me.

20:48.131 --> 20:50.403
- We can do it.
- I should go too.

20:50.503 --> 20:54.673
No. You're staying here. As before.
The whole thing stays the same,

20:54.773 --> 20:58.006
only difference, you don't have
this fucker slowing you down.

20:58.106 --> 21:01.590
I'm a big boy. I just have to wait
a couple of hours, don't I?

21:02.025 --> 21:04.715
Call that dodgy quack, Fallon, yeah?

21:04.815 --> 21:07.973
He'll come and patch me up.
After the work.

21:08.073 --> 21:09.923
We could take you to him now
or just bring him here.

21:10.023 --> 21:14.040
No! There's 27 million in that depot
today. Get him dressed for work.

21:14.140 --> 21:15.840
We stick to the schedule.

21:15.940 --> 21:21.656
You two come back here after the work.
You take me to him, after, okay? Yes?

21:21.756 --> 21:23.465
We've done the hardest bit,
haven't we, Shane?

21:23.565 --> 21:26.598
- No fucking names!
- Sorry.

21:26.698 --> 21:30.822
- I should go to the depot.
- We stick to the schedule.

21:32.231 --> 21:34.616
Now get him dressed for work.

23:11.814 --> 23:14.039
Go to casualty...

23:14.139 --> 23:16.591
recovery position...

23:20.798 --> 23:22.823
A tourniquet?

23:22.923 --> 23:25.741
How do you tie a tourniquet
around a stomach?

23:37.539 --> 23:39.148
Stop the bleeding...

24:22.306 --> 24:24.276
Oi! Someone get in here!

24:28.273 --> 24:31.756
Look, it says here if we raise the wound
above the heart we can stop the bleeding.

24:31.856 --> 24:34.824
I want to raise the bed. Come help me.

24:35.064 --> 24:36.798
Come.

24:36.898 --> 24:38.824
Get those books.

24:39.814 --> 24:42.807
- Is that enough?
- Enough.

24:44.314 --> 24:46.331
- On three.
- Okay.

24:46.431 --> 24:48.798
One, two, three.

24:48.898 --> 24:51.666
Wait. Wait.

24:53.648 --> 24:55.464
The wife.

24:55.564 --> 24:57.699
She's a doctor.

25:48.398 --> 25:50.403
Give me some space. Stand over there.

26:33.647 --> 26:37.140
I need boiling water
and towels cut into strips.

26:38.539 --> 26:39.638
Now.

27:07.189 --> 27:09.251
Okay. I'm gonna have to take this out.

27:09.351 --> 27:12.714
- Leave it in.
- I'm a doctor.

27:12.814 --> 27:14.790
I know exactly what I'm doing.

27:18.069 --> 27:20.274
Okay. Okay.

27:24.147 --> 27:25.907
Fuck!

27:26.231 --> 27:27.990
Fuck!

27:29.429 --> 27:30.706
There's only so much I can do.

27:30.806 --> 27:33.889
It's a deep puncture wound
and he's already lost a lot of blood.

27:33.989 --> 27:37.865
There's internal bleeding and there may be
fragments of glass left in the wound.

27:41.797 --> 27:44.365
You need my husband to help you, yes?

27:46.006 --> 27:50.215
And you're holding me and my son
to ensure his compliance.

27:51.714 --> 27:53.915
If this goes wrong...

27:55.214 --> 27:57.738
we won't get out of here, will we?

28:01.447 --> 28:06.089
Well, let's just hope that everything...
goes smoothly.

28:06.189 --> 28:08.336
Do we still need to raise the bed?

28:08.436 --> 28:10.762
Don't be ridiculous.

28:36.961 --> 28:39.587
- I'll get rid of this.
- No!

29:22.961 --> 29:25.329
It's all clean downstairs!

29:26.877 --> 29:28.761
Look, me and my friend,
we're gonna do this job.

29:28.861 --> 29:30.869
We're just not doing it
with your boy, okay?

29:30.969 --> 29:33.327
- We're leaving here as planned.
- I said that, didn't I?

29:33.427 --> 29:35.511
I just don't wanna work
with someone that I don't know.

29:35.611 --> 29:38.140
Especially on the edge and I don't like
his attitude. I'm sorry.

29:38.240 --> 29:40.754
I fucking said that, didn't I?

29:47.377 --> 29:51.610
- I'm gonna need to take the shoe.
- This is planned. You stay here, okay?

29:51.710 --> 29:54.069
Someone's got to take your place
and I'm stepping up.

29:54.169 --> 29:56.819
His other half is doing it.
He's on the van.

29:56.919 --> 30:00.510
You stay here. Do the scanner.
Watch the hostages as planned, okay?

30:00.610 --> 30:01.635
Fuck!

30:01.735 --> 30:04.270
You need to clean up the evidence we've
left behind. There's a lot of blood here.

30:04.370 --> 30:06.313
- It's a mess.
- I ain't a cleaner.

30:06.413 --> 30:08.769
It's not the score that's hard.
It's getting away with it.

30:08.869 --> 30:12.327
Cleaning up is the most important part
of this job. We are all relying on you.

30:12.427 --> 30:15.545
Get some bleach
and clean up every single drop.

30:18.260 --> 30:20.137
This is bullshit!

30:23.185 --> 30:26.645
- You don't trust me, no.
- My decision is made.

30:28.477 --> 30:30.137
Hey!

30:31.085 --> 30:32.845
Come here.

30:35.085 --> 30:37.045
Come here.

30:45.527 --> 30:49.003
Hey. Hey. I don't want him to hear.

30:51.335 --> 30:53.137
Come here.

30:54.027 --> 30:58.478
I'm old. I'm a scared old man.

30:59.552 --> 31:03.469
I stood up for you.
I told them you'd be outstanding.

31:03.569 --> 31:07.970
I said, "He is solid."

31:10.077 --> 31:12.219
I can do this, Shane.

31:12.319 --> 31:14.985
- I can.
- I know. I know.

31:15.085 --> 31:18.985
That stretch straightened you out, boy.
It straightened you right out.

31:19.085 --> 31:21.852
Just be grateful you don't have
to work up a sweat. I'm outta here.

31:21.952 --> 31:25.345
- Slow and sure, control the room.
- You're the boss.

31:32.160 --> 31:37.635
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm fan-fucking-tastic.

31:37.735 --> 31:39.687
Go on with it.

32:56.127 --> 32:58.885
- What's that?
- Accelerants.

32:58.985 --> 33:03.410
Your DNA's all over the place.
No amount of bleach is gonna hide that.

33:03.510 --> 33:05.969
The only way to do this properly
is to burn it down.

33:06.069 --> 33:08.881
We'll soak the mattress. Do the lot.

33:11.877 --> 33:14.068
You were always mad
for burning stuff up.

33:14.168 --> 33:17.060
Hey, just you make sure
that I'm not here when you do it, yeah?

33:17.160 --> 33:19.228
Yeah, yeah.

33:47.352 --> 33:50.402
I should be in the front doing the job.

33:50.502 --> 33:53.235
Your place is here.

33:53.335 --> 33:56.585
We spent months planning this.

33:56.685 --> 34:00.318
You're what, five weeks out?
I brought you in.

34:00.418 --> 34:04.220
You should be thankful for that.

34:06.077 --> 34:08.610
Why do you talk to me like a kid?

34:10.293 --> 34:12.268
Somewhere quiet.

34:12.368 --> 34:14.199
Middle of nowhere.

34:14.300 --> 34:17.527
Stay in a B&B. Pay cash.

34:17.627 --> 34:21.070
- Keep your head down for six months.
- What's this?

34:30.735 --> 34:33.678
You know what I did first thing
when I got out?

34:34.226 --> 34:36.453
I went to see Lucille.

34:37.476 --> 34:38.996
You seen her lately?

34:41.993 --> 34:43.533
No.

34:43.632 --> 34:46.568
I haven't seen her for... years.

34:46.668 --> 34:49.335
She's got a little one
as well, you know?

34:49.435 --> 34:51.710
Beautiful little thing.

34:54.202 --> 34:56.500
Yeah, my first fuck as a free man.

34:58.268 --> 35:00.353
Nothing like it.

35:07.502 --> 35:09.786
Go on, just pick up.

35:10.693 --> 35:13.360
- Hello.
- <i>Showtime. Everything good there?</i>

35:13.460 --> 35:15.885
All great. Start the clock.
Start the clock.

35:15.985 --> 35:18.485
<i>We're pulling up
to the security lodge now.</i>

35:18.585 --> 35:20.493
- <i>You hear me all right?</i>
- Loud and clear.

35:20.593 --> 35:23.290
- You copy, Number 2?
- <i>Yes, good. In position.</i>

35:23.390 --> 35:25.643
Yeah, we're good then?
Nothing on the scanner.

35:25.943 --> 35:29.427
- Slow and sure.
- <i>Approaching the security gate now...</i>

35:29.727 --> 35:33.095
<i>Show your pass to the window, Doug.
That's it.</i>

35:39.852 --> 35:43.428
<i>All right. We're through.
I'll take care of the guard.</i>

35:45.610 --> 35:49.303
- <i>Excuse me, sir, can I have a word?</i>
- <i>Yes, Officer.</i>

35:50.043 --> 35:53.210
- <i>Gate's open, we're going inside.</i>
- <i>Copy that. On my way.</i>

35:53.310 --> 35:56.527
- Come on, boy!
- <i>Heading to the security room.</i>

35:56.627 --> 35:58.827
<i>Stay in front there, Doug.</i>

35:58.927 --> 36:02.443
<i>Remember this is just another day at work.
Can you try and look a little less nervous?</i>

36:02.543 --> 36:04.010
<i>Are you all right, Mr Fairfield?</i>

36:04.110 --> 36:06.952
<i>This... policeman,
he needs to speak with you...</i>

36:07.052 --> 36:09.302
- <i>What's going on?</i>
- <i>Get down on the floor!</i>

36:09.602 --> 36:12.018
- <i>No one gets hurt.</i>
- <i>Please do as he says.</i>

36:12.118 --> 36:13.360
<i>They're holding my family.</i>

36:13.460 --> 36:16.077
<i>Don't hit any alarms,
do everything he says.</i>

36:16.177 --> 36:18.211
<i>Get on the floor!</i>

36:19.868 --> 36:22.752
<i>Get your hands behind your back now!</i>

36:22.852 --> 36:26.360
- <i>That's security taken care of.</i>
- <i>Ma'am, if you please. I'm coming in here.</i>

36:26.460 --> 36:29.302
You must secure all the staff.
Don't forget the staff.

36:29.402 --> 36:32.693
And remember the personal alarms.
Don't let any of them against the walls.

36:32.793 --> 36:35.743
- <i>How many staff are on shift now?
- Just four or five.</i>

36:35.843 --> 36:38.935
<i>You call them into the meeting room.
You sit them down.</i>

36:39.035 --> 36:40.735
Slow and sure.

36:40.835 --> 36:42.768
<i>Come on, let's do this.</i>

36:42.868 --> 36:45.060
<i>Everybody down!</i>

36:45.160 --> 36:48.868
- <i>Get on the floor!</i>
- <i>Stay calm or they'll kill us.</i>

36:49.118 --> 36:52.693
<i>No problems, everyone.
Please, please, do as these men say.</i>

36:52.793 --> 36:54.351
<i>They're holding my family.</i>

36:54.451 --> 36:58.343
<i>Nobody go near the fucking
wall alarms... face to the floor!</i>

36:58.443 --> 37:02.819
Remember, it's the red bundles.
The red ones. The twenties...

37:06.876 --> 37:09.601
<i>Go for the red bundles.
The red bundles, yeah.</i>

37:09.701 --> 37:12.360
<i>We know. We're the ones
that are doing all the hard work</i>

37:12.460 --> 37:15.985
<i>while you guys are sitting on your arses
drinking tea over there.</i>

37:16.085 --> 37:18.985
Yeah, we're just excited,
we're excited here.

37:19.085 --> 37:21.526
<i>So you want to be in on the action?</i>

37:21.626 --> 37:23.568
<i>I got a massive buzz on, man.</i>

37:24.368 --> 37:26.661
<i>Let's get this moving!</i>

37:28.585 --> 37:29.588
Hello?

37:31.560 --> 37:33.219
Hello?

37:34.085 --> 37:37.710
Hello? Can you hear me? Hello?

37:37.810 --> 37:38.843
Shit, we lost him.

37:38.943 --> 37:42.679
Don't worry about it.
They're probably just busy. It's just...

37:42.779 --> 37:44.326
They'll call when they're done.

37:44.626 --> 37:49.801
You call them if you hear anything
on the scanner.

37:49.901 --> 37:51.511
Okay.

38:01.501 --> 38:03.844
We've just gotta hope it works.

39:16.936 --> 39:18.940
Oh, my God!

39:21.439 --> 39:23.719
Hey, hey!

39:24.668 --> 39:27.003
We're gonna find something
to cut you free, okay?

39:34.293 --> 39:35.953
Okay.

39:46.126 --> 39:47.420
Mr Fairfield?

39:51.710 --> 39:53.376
Come on!

39:53.476 --> 39:55.136
Hello?

39:56.701 --> 39:58.528
Hello?

40:00.056 --> 40:02.161
Just wait. Just wait.

40:03.185 --> 40:04.869
Lynn?

40:05.335 --> 40:06.844
Anybody home?

40:10.976 --> 40:13.311
I'm coming up the stairs.

40:21.518 --> 40:22.877
Lynn?

40:26.518 --> 40:28.177
Lynn?

40:33.437 --> 40:35.311
Oh, my God!

40:35.709 --> 40:37.734
Would you say that you'd seen my face?

40:37.834 --> 40:41.180
Who are you? What's going on here?

40:41.280 --> 40:42.443
Lynn?

40:42.543 --> 40:44.476
- It's gonna be an issue.
- What?

40:44.576 --> 40:47.334
- I don't want to do this.
- Do what?

40:47.434 --> 40:49.194
This!

41:19.884 --> 41:22.223
Cover yourself up.

41:39.918 --> 41:41.961
What have you done?

41:46.851 --> 41:49.094
He's not gonna like this!

42:26.143 --> 42:28.152
We're gonna call you...

42:30.601 --> 42:32.469
Lover Boy.

43:32.268 --> 43:34.336
Naughty boy?

44:06.084 --> 44:08.368
You and me, boy...

44:09.742 --> 44:11.802
We ain't finished.

44:30.526 --> 44:33.744
You can't just go hitting people
with cricket bats.

44:36.626 --> 44:38.860
Someone might get hurt.

45:36.409 --> 45:38.069
No!

45:41.892 --> 45:43.652
Don't!

45:59.942 --> 46:01.602
What?

46:43.726 --> 46:45.960
Help!

46:46.434 --> 46:48.851
Help!

46:48.951 --> 46:51.084
Someone, please!

46:51.184 --> 46:53.394
Help me!

46:56.626 --> 46:58.385
Fuck!

48:44.434 --> 48:46.768
I thought you said you got rid of it.

49:05.292 --> 49:08.660
Fucking thing messed up my life once.

49:08.784 --> 49:10.910
You're gonna help me now.

49:14.884 --> 49:16.192
No!

49:16.292 --> 49:19.609
Fuck! Where's the bolt? Fuck!

49:19.709 --> 49:23.460
Fuck! No! No!

49:25.417 --> 49:27.118
Fuck.

49:28.200 --> 49:29.460
Help!

49:37.925 --> 49:39.627
Yeah?

49:41.250 --> 49:43.210
No, he's fine.

49:44.084 --> 49:46.636
No, nothing from the feds.
What's happening?

49:50.125 --> 49:52.869
All right. See you soon.

49:53.025 --> 49:56.617
Staff are locked in the vault.
They drove away with a fat lot.

49:57.017 --> 49:59.729
We did it. We fucking did it.

50:01.525 --> 50:02.971
Who's up there?

50:04.692 --> 50:08.111
It's nothing. Got it covered.

50:09.634 --> 50:11.319
You're gonna hurt her?

50:11.884 --> 50:14.737
Look, just... close your eyes.

50:14.837 --> 50:17.074
Think of the money.

50:22.467 --> 50:24.246
Stop.

50:24.346 --> 50:26.742
Stop. Stop! Stop!

50:26.842 --> 50:28.992
I'm not gonna make it.
I'm not gonna make it.

50:29.292 --> 50:33.117
- Don't be silly. Of course you are.
- There's glass inside.

50:33.217 --> 50:36.219
I can feel it tearing my insides.

50:38.250 --> 50:42.075
Take me down. To the garden.
I need to see the garden.

50:42.175 --> 50:44.300
You know, we can't do that.

50:44.400 --> 50:47.160
Just try and rest, all right?

50:54.192 --> 50:57.629
One, two, three.

50:59.417 --> 51:02.944
One, two, three.

51:55.750 --> 51:58.652
You know, this time last month
I was inside.

52:01.500 --> 52:04.985
2,164 days.

52:08.067 --> 52:10.344
I ain't going back there again.

52:10.667 --> 52:13.244
See, I went in 'cause of weakness.

52:13.567 --> 52:15.902
I was robbing a house.

52:17.458 --> 52:19.902
And some guy jumped out.

52:24.025 --> 52:26.569
So, I cut him in his throat.

52:28.567 --> 52:30.960
Which is all right.

52:31.458 --> 52:33.777
But there was some kid watching...

52:34.625 --> 52:36.819
the whole thing.

52:37.167 --> 52:39.685
You know, I looked at him
and I thought...

52:40.250 --> 52:42.308
"He's just a kid.

52:42.808 --> 52:45.060
"He's harmless."

52:45.958 --> 52:49.110
That was his testimony that put me away.

52:52.208 --> 52:54.001
Just so you know...

52:54.833 --> 52:57.352
I'm very motivated.

53:12.167 --> 53:15.227
Bitch! Fucking bitch!

53:29.257 --> 53:33.277
- I'm going to fucking kill you!
- Are you very frightened?

53:34.542 --> 53:38.027
- Yeah.
- Wait till I get out!

53:38.450 --> 53:40.819
I don't wanna die.

53:43.375 --> 53:46.766
- That makes two of us.
- Shane, let me out!

53:54.233 --> 53:56.652
He killed someone?

53:57.917 --> 53:59.985
Answer me.

54:01.317 --> 54:04.044
- Yeah.
- Who?

54:05.275 --> 54:07.204
I don't know.

54:07.304 --> 54:08.769
Let me out!

54:12.850 --> 54:15.460
I watched his dad die.

54:16.625 --> 54:18.860
We were best friends.

54:20.041 --> 54:23.060
We served together.

54:23.858 --> 54:25.227
Two tours.

54:27.216 --> 54:29.138
He had cancer.

54:31.250 --> 54:33.665
I watched him waste away.

54:33.765 --> 54:35.452
Only in...

54:35.552 --> 54:40.847
the later stages he was
begging to be finished.

54:43.525 --> 54:46.175
There's no dignity there, I mean...

54:46.275 --> 54:48.100
Fuck that.

54:48.200 --> 54:50.268
Who wants that?

54:50.616 --> 54:52.458
So in the end...

54:52.558 --> 54:54.512
I put a pillow...

54:54.612 --> 54:56.922
on his face.

54:58.916 --> 55:01.352
It was a kindness.

55:03.925 --> 55:06.050
- Let me out!
- It's all right.

55:06.150 --> 55:08.993
He's not coming out for a while, is he?

55:12.516 --> 55:14.485
I guess not.

55:15.316 --> 55:17.477
Tell us a joke.

55:19.291 --> 55:21.693
- What?
- Anything.

55:22.000 --> 55:25.275
- I don't know any.
- Yeah, you do.

55:25.375 --> 55:29.660
Please, don't think too hard.
It'll come.

55:32.083 --> 55:33.252
Go.

55:44.666 --> 55:47.416
There's two goldfish in a tank...

55:47.516 --> 55:49.273
And...

55:49.823 --> 55:52.589
one turns to the other and says...

55:53.083 --> 55:55.680
"You drive, I'll do the gun."

56:01.633 --> 56:03.602
All right.

56:04.775 --> 56:06.935
All right, what?

56:07.375 --> 56:09.443
Fuck off, then.

56:12.600 --> 56:14.568
Shane, please!

57:16.233 --> 57:17.742
No!

57:18.091 --> 57:20.977
We need to go now. We need to go.

57:23.066 --> 57:25.533
Stop, stop, stop.

57:33.608 --> 57:35.806
Come here.

57:49.916 --> 57:51.442
I'm frightened.

57:55.041 --> 57:57.991
I've done questionable things.

58:04.674 --> 58:06.943
Think about the people you love.

58:10.474 --> 58:12.401
Come on.

58:19.916 --> 58:22.402
- Get that.
- What are you talking about?

58:22.502 --> 58:25.299
Officer, please help! Help!
He's upstairs, he's...

58:25.399 --> 58:27.167
They're upstairs!

58:28.191 --> 58:31.324
Get down on the ground! Face down!
Face down! Don't look at me!

58:31.424 --> 58:34.508
- No, no, no...
- Take that fucking...

58:34.608 --> 58:36.085
No, no!

58:41.333 --> 58:44.501
Stupid fuck. He's locked in the attic.

58:44.601 --> 58:46.312
Who?

58:46.412 --> 58:48.983
- Shut up!
- No shit.

58:49.083 --> 58:52.949
He says there is a girl as well.
Says she's seen his face.

58:53.749 --> 58:57.508
She knows his name. Fuck!

58:57.608 --> 58:59.160
Shut up!

58:59.260 --> 59:01.299
Stay down!

59:04.483 --> 59:06.635
So what are you saying?

59:07.791 --> 59:12.358
Think about it. If that idiot gets caught,
he'll give us up for sure.

59:12.458 --> 59:16.476
Leave him up there for now.
We have to take care of her.

59:19.508 --> 59:22.358
- She's a little girl.
- I don't like it, either.

59:22.458 --> 59:24.651
She's a little girl.

59:24.791 --> 59:26.924
I'll look after her.

59:27.024 --> 59:29.218
You take care of them.

59:30.191 --> 59:31.833
Hey...

59:32.533 --> 59:34.765
everybody dies.

01:00:57.124 --> 01:00:59.426
You look like shit.

01:01:02.458 --> 01:01:04.691
We cleaned the depot out.

01:01:04.791 --> 01:01:08.191
No one has a clue. They won't for hours.

01:01:08.291 --> 01:01:10.899
And it's all thanks to you.

01:01:10.999 --> 01:01:13.017
That's great.

01:01:14.941 --> 01:01:19.651
There is the girl we didn't
know about running around.

01:01:20.299 --> 01:01:22.568
She knows too much.

01:01:23.082 --> 01:01:28.562
What you pissing about here then for?
Just take the money and... and go.

01:01:31.357 --> 01:01:36.076
There's a lady, a lady.
I want her looked after.

01:01:36.624 --> 01:01:38.401
It's Lucille.

01:01:38.501 --> 01:01:40.399
Don't kill Callum.

01:01:41.457 --> 01:01:43.232
Lucille. It's done.

01:01:43.332 --> 01:01:46.201
- You find her.
- I find her.

01:01:48.982 --> 01:01:52.503
If you see the girl, you pop her.

01:01:52.924 --> 01:01:55.424
Okay? You do it for us.

01:01:55.524 --> 01:01:57.693
For the score.

01:01:58.332 --> 01:02:03.423
- For Lucille.
- Just go. Go.

01:02:08.274 --> 01:02:10.004
We had some good times.

01:02:36.066 --> 01:02:39.743
You check upstairs. I'll look outside.

01:02:48.682 --> 01:02:51.611
Think. Come on.

01:02:53.666 --> 01:02:55.399
Who's there?

01:02:55.499 --> 01:02:57.321
Open the hatch!

01:02:59.582 --> 01:03:02.857
Open the hatch! Open the fucking hatch!

01:03:02.957 --> 01:03:05.176
Who's down there?

01:03:05.582 --> 01:03:07.784
Shane, open the hatch!

01:03:09.891 --> 01:03:13.692
- Open the fucking hatch!
- I'm coming, man.

01:03:14.749 --> 01:03:17.068
Fuck! Let me out!

01:03:19.907 --> 01:03:23.165
- What the fuck you doing down there?
- Hang on.

01:03:23.574 --> 01:03:25.849
- Let me out of here!
- Fucking, hang on, Callum.

01:03:25.949 --> 01:03:28.018
Let me out!

01:03:28.649 --> 01:03:30.818
For fuck's sake!

01:03:31.457 --> 01:03:33.326
Come on!

01:03:38.582 --> 01:03:40.691
Get me down!

01:03:42.457 --> 01:03:45.196
Shut the fuck up...

01:03:53.749 --> 01:03:56.866
- You killed the girl?
- She's fucking hiding somewhere.

01:03:56.966 --> 01:03:59.132
What the fuck you doing here, then?
Sort it.

01:03:59.232 --> 01:04:00.503
She's got a gun?

01:04:00.603 --> 01:04:03.268
- Yeah, we've all got a gun.
- Shane won't allow it.

01:04:03.368 --> 01:04:07.173
- Forget Shane, he's finished.
- Shane won't allow it!

01:04:14.582 --> 01:04:16.441
You ain't got the balls
for this, have you?

01:04:16.541 --> 01:04:18.901
And you do?

01:04:20.982 --> 01:04:23.318
Give me the gun, I'll sort it.

01:04:31.416 --> 01:04:33.541
Make yourself useful.

01:04:33.641 --> 01:04:35.058
Start the fire.

01:04:36.616 --> 01:04:38.849
We'll smoke her out.

01:04:39.607 --> 01:04:41.349
How much did you get, by the way?

01:04:41.749 --> 01:04:45.367
We had to use a forklift. A fuckload.

01:04:48.749 --> 01:04:50.672
Good job.

01:07:24.715 --> 01:07:26.784
Fuck!

01:10:43.915 --> 01:10:47.123
Help! Help!

01:10:48.207 --> 01:10:49.375
Help!

01:10:55.707 --> 01:10:58.175
Please, please don't hurt me.

01:11:00.498 --> 01:11:02.219
Who are you?

01:11:02.319 --> 01:11:04.642
They're gonna kill you. Run!

01:12:40.190 --> 01:12:42.358
Bloody mess!

01:12:47.565 --> 01:12:50.690
The plan was perfect!
And you still ballsed it up.

01:12:50.790 --> 01:12:54.190
Had to be you. I thought
you'd be trouble and I was right.

01:12:54.290 --> 01:12:56.515
I took control.

01:12:56.665 --> 01:12:58.733
I had to.

01:12:59.340 --> 01:13:01.556
Wait. There's something
you should know...

01:13:01.956 --> 01:13:05.637
There are cameras hidden all over
this house. There's one up there.

01:13:06.790 --> 01:13:09.815
I've recorded all our conversations.

01:13:09.915 --> 01:13:12.335
Now put that gun down!

01:13:15.331 --> 01:13:17.200
All right.

01:13:18.231 --> 01:13:20.308
It's as before.

01:13:20.898 --> 01:13:23.406
Go play the victim, I'll take off.

01:13:23.606 --> 01:13:26.965
And remember, I know exactly
how much money was in that vault.

01:13:27.065 --> 01:13:30.448
And I want my cut hidden at the flop
as arranged, otherwise...

01:13:30.548 --> 01:13:32.317
Done!

01:13:35.331 --> 01:13:39.347
Luckily for you the fire will destroy
most of your mistakes.

01:13:39.556 --> 01:13:41.308
First...

01:13:43.623 --> 01:13:45.704
You'd better deal with that.

01:14:05.856 --> 01:14:07.738
Stop!

01:14:07.838 --> 01:14:12.333
- Please, keep calm!
- Don't move! Don't fucking move!

01:14:13.706 --> 01:14:16.017
Oh, bloody Christ!

01:14:16.656 --> 01:14:19.328
Look at this terrible, terrible mess.

01:14:19.428 --> 01:14:21.565
Should have been so easy.

01:14:21.665 --> 01:14:23.731
No one was meant to get hurt.

01:14:23.831 --> 01:14:27.573
All I wanted to do was live out
my days on a nice boat.

01:14:27.673 --> 01:14:30.065
No debts, no mortgages

01:14:30.165 --> 01:14:33.798
and away from that psycho bitch
and that screw-up of a son.

01:14:33.898 --> 01:14:36.525
This is your fault.

01:14:41.340 --> 01:14:42.424
Now, Lynn...

01:14:58.898 --> 01:15:01.892
There's no need
to point that thing at me.

01:15:03.898 --> 01:15:06.409
You can trust me.

01:15:12.498 --> 01:15:15.323
I don't know who to trust anymore.

01:15:23.164 --> 01:15:25.315
We need to get out of here now.

01:15:28.914 --> 01:15:31.146
Kelly, come on!

01:16:08.439 --> 01:16:10.806
I can't fit anymore.

01:16:13.456 --> 01:16:17.058
I can come with you. We could go to Rio.

01:16:17.898 --> 01:16:19.618
Is that what you really want?

01:16:20.731 --> 01:16:22.456
I don't know.

01:16:22.556 --> 01:16:24.065
You were right.

01:16:25.289 --> 01:16:27.733
You've got a future ahead of you.

01:16:28.789 --> 01:16:31.883
And... and now, I do too.

01:16:32.023 --> 01:16:34.339
Come on, you've got to go now!

01:16:34.439 --> 01:16:36.885
- Okay. Go over the story.
- We were tied up,

01:16:36.985 --> 01:16:40.739
we didn't see anything,
the fight broke out against them.

01:16:40.839 --> 01:16:45.008
A fire started but we managed to get out
in time and you were never here.

01:16:45.623 --> 01:16:48.702
But... what about the...

01:16:49.056 --> 01:16:52.591
Mark, Kelly knows what she's doing.

01:16:53.789 --> 01:16:55.847
We'll be fine.

01:16:56.164 --> 01:16:58.233
I promise.

01:17:08.456 --> 01:17:10.225
Bye.
