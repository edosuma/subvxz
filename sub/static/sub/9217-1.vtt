01:19.560 --> 01:24.680
<i>This is 2-5. Sitrep coming.
Continuing ahead, single file</i>

01:25.880 --> 01:30.480
<i>2000 south, Adam Khan Kalay.
Everything is calm in the area. Over.</i>

01:33.480 --> 01:37.160
<i>6-0, this is 2-5 Dolly.
Dolly, over.</i>

01:39.760 --> 01:44.480
2-5, this is 6-0. You are Dolly.
You are Dolly. Copy, out.

01:45.360 --> 01:48.680
– He's up here.
– Get a logstat on 3-5.

01:51.360 --> 01:54.120
3-5, this is 6-0, over.

02:32.200 --> 02:37.200
<i>2-5, 2-5, this is 6-0. Over.</i>

02:41.800 --> 02:43.920
<i>2-5, this is 6-0.</i>

02:47.840 --> 02:50.520
– Fuck!
– Anders is hit!

02:50.680 --> 02:55.360
– We need a medic here!
– Medic, now! Come on!

02:55.520 --> 02:57.160
Can you see him?

02:57.320 --> 03:00.320
– Anders has been hit.
– He's behind there.

03:01.040 --> 03:04.040
– What is it?
– That was a 9-0.

03:04.200 --> 03:06.880
– 9-0 about what?
<i>– Contact IED.</i>

03:07.040 --> 03:10.120
9-0, 9-0, 6-0.
Who knows something? Over.

03:12.200 --> 03:14.800
Anders? Anders, Anders ...

03:14.960 --> 03:17.400
Jones! Come here, tighten this.

03:17.880 --> 03:21.560
Lasse, if you can,
just put something in there –

03:22.600 --> 03:24.880
– to stop the bleeding, okay?

03:25.040 --> 03:28.640
– Some gauze or bandages.
– Got it, got it.

03:28.800 --> 03:33.440
6-0, this is 2-5.
Ready for a partial 9-liner. Over.

03:34.400 --> 03:37.120
<i>1410. Over.</i>

03:37.800 --> 03:41.760
– 3814.
– 6-0, copy that. Out.

03:42.480 --> 03:45.000
– 381410.
– Here.

03:45.160 --> 03:49.800
– Anders Holm. GV1, 2. batallion.
– I need a status on him right now.

03:49.960 --> 03:54.720
6-0, status from Papa. We need a
complete 9-liner and a sitrep.

03:54.880 --> 03:56.960
Medevac ETA 15.

03:57.120 --> 03:59.680
He's not breathing.

03:59.840 --> 04:02.600
Very weak breathing.

04:02.760 --> 04:06.040
– When is that medevac coming?
– Come on, Anders.

04:06.960 --> 04:09.600
Let's go. Not too high.
That's right.

04:09.760 --> 04:13.400
– Keep his mouth open.
– I can't feel anything here.

04:13.560 --> 04:16.720
– Fuck, man!
– Lasse, calm down.

04:16.880 --> 04:21.280
– Come on, Anders!
– Five! That's fucking ...

04:21.440 --> 04:24.920
– Where is that fucking helicopter?
– Lasse, calm down.

04:25.080 --> 04:28.400
– Let's go, let's go.
– He has no pulse in his wrist.

04:29.440 --> 04:34.320
<i>Double amputation.
Charlie is severely critical.</i>

04:34.480 --> 04:37.200
– Okay, he's bleeding out now.
– Come on!

04:37.360 --> 04:40.520
... 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30.

04:46.080 --> 04:50.360
He isn't breathing,
and we can't find the pulse in his neck.

04:50.520 --> 04:53.240
– He's gone.
– He's totally gone?

04:55.840 --> 04:59.760
<i>We have ended CPR. We ...</i>

05:01.760 --> 05:05.800
<i>We'll spend the time
on readying for transport. Out.</i>

05:09.160 --> 05:10.960
6-0, copy that.

05:17.640 --> 05:19.240
Are you alright?

05:20.520 --> 05:24.120
I need you to stay focused. Okay?

06:09.400 --> 06:13.920
As you probably know, Anders was
declared DOA at Bastion.

06:14.080 --> 06:18.240
– How are the guys feeling?
– They're awful.

06:18.400 --> 06:21.520
Especially my second rifleman, Lasse.

06:23.680 --> 06:26.800
– What about you?
– None of the guys feel good.

06:26.960 --> 06:31.040
We feel like walking targets.
The guys are powerless.

06:31.200 --> 06:35.040
They can't do anything. The guys don't
see the purpose of patrolling ...

06:35.200 --> 06:38.880
Hold on a sec.
Let's see this from their perspective.

06:39.040 --> 06:42.520
The guys just lost a friend.
They're frustrated.

06:42.680 --> 06:46.720
I'm just saying
the assignments make no sense.

06:46.880 --> 06:49.920
I've just lost one of my 21-year-olds, –

06:50.080 --> 06:53.640
– who bled out right in front of me.
THAT makes no sense!

06:53.800 --> 06:58.120
Of course it doesn't.
Go take care of the guys.

07:05.160 --> 07:07.240
What are your thoughts on this?

07:08.320 --> 07:12.920
It's been a tough day.
They need to let off some steam.

07:14.960 --> 07:20.560
We need to take care of this.
I will patrol with them tomorrow and onwards.

07:20.720 --> 07:24.280
Gather the guys at 20.30.
I'll brief them myself.

07:39.280 --> 07:43.480
Do any of you have any doubts
about why you are here?

07:46.280 --> 07:49.680
It's to secure and help the civil population, –

07:49.840 --> 07:54.200
– so they can have a decent life
and rebuild their land.

07:54.360 --> 07:59.000
I know you walk on patrol a lot,
and that you use a lot of energy.

07:59.160 --> 08:04.200
But that's because we have momentum.
We're getting the civilians on our side.

08:05.600 --> 08:11.200
That's why it's so important
that we show our presence in the area.

08:25.920 --> 08:27.800
Where is he?

08:29.440 --> 08:32.240
– Where is Julius?
– He's gone outside to play.

08:32.400 --> 08:35.200
We just have to talk to Birgitte now.

08:35.360 --> 08:38.200
Hi, Maria.
Thanks for stopping by.

08:38.360 --> 08:43.600
Julius has been in a fight
with one of the other boys today.

08:43.760 --> 08:46.920
– Was it serious?
– Yes, he wouldn't calm down and

08:47.080 --> 08:50.320
he bit the other boy in the shoulder.

08:50.480 --> 08:53.360
Now, you yourself suggested that
we should have a talk, –

08:53.520 --> 08:57.160
– you, me, and his head teacher.

08:57.320 --> 09:01.480
Yes, of course, let's do that soon.
On Friday, I'll be off at 3.

09:01.640 --> 09:05.600
– I could be here around 3.30.
– I'll just have a look in my calendar.

09:05.760 --> 09:08.600
Just a moment, please.

09:11.920 --> 09:16.440
Julius bit ...
Julius bit a boy.

09:16.600 --> 09:19.920
Yes, he did, sweetie.
You can't do that.

09:20.800 --> 09:23.120
When are we going home?

09:27.080 --> 09:31.040
As far as I can tell,
it'll be a bit difficult find a time, –

09:31.200 --> 09:34.800
– but let's see if we can't.
I have a lot to do on Friday but...

09:37.680 --> 09:39.880
Julius?

09:41.360 --> 09:45.920
Hey! It's time to go home.
Come on.

09:47.360 --> 09:50.800
We need to go home now, Julius.
Figne is waiting for us.

09:54.200 --> 09:58.120
Julius, come on now.
Julius, sweetie?

10:00.920 --> 10:02.760
Julius?

10:04.160 --> 10:06.680
Come, dad's calling tonight.

10:13.800 --> 10:15.360
Come here.

10:17.080 --> 10:18.920
Oh, wow!

10:26.040 --> 10:29.400
– What is eight plus eight?
– That's so easy.

10:29.560 --> 10:32.440
– Sixteen.
– You're so ugly.

10:32.600 --> 10:36.080
– You're so annoying.
– No, you are.

10:38.200 --> 10:40.600
What's twenty plus twenty?

10:40.760 --> 10:43.720
– Forty.
– You look like an old guy called Morty.

10:43.880 --> 10:46.960
Why are you such a fucking pain?

10:48.920 --> 10:54.080
Alright, stop it. Turn off the TV,
and go sit at the table. We eat in 5 minutes.

10:54.240 --> 10:58.880
Figne, I know he's annoying,
but just leave him be.

11:00.080 --> 11:03.960
Alright, sit at the table.
Elliot, please sit at the table.

11:04.120 --> 11:07.160
Sit at the table, so we can eat.

11:07.320 --> 11:10.720
– Cut this.
– You want me to cut it?

11:11.480 --> 11:14.960
"Dear mom, please cut this for me."

11:15.120 --> 11:19.560
– You are not a "dear mom".
– You are such a little rascal.

11:19.720 --> 11:23.960
Here, do the rest.
Get some ketchup if you want, guys.

11:24.120 --> 11:27.600
Dad will be calling any minute now.

11:35.840 --> 11:38.960
– What time is it?
– Only half past seven.

11:40.480 --> 11:43.760
– That's a lot.
– Yeah, that is a lot, Elliot.

11:47.520 --> 11:50.680
You can go watch some TV.

11:54.440 --> 11:57.360
– I want some milk.
– Then go get some milk.

11:57.520 --> 11:59.600
Can I have that?

12:03.240 --> 12:05.920
Easy, easy, easy ...

12:08.040 --> 12:09.920
You're such a good boy.

12:10.080 --> 12:15.200
I can drink a lot ...
I can drink a lot of milk.

12:15.360 --> 12:19.040
Yeah, you can drink a whole liter.
A whole carton.

12:22.320 --> 12:25.640
That wasn't good for me.

12:27.160 --> 12:29.280
No, that wasn't good for you.

13:03.440 --> 13:07.080
Don't worry about it.
How are you?

13:13.080 --> 13:14.720
Who?

13:19.000 --> 13:22.200
How old was he?
Are you alright?

13:24.280 --> 13:26.960
Okay, good. Well, we're ...

13:28.600 --> 13:30.760
We are fine.

13:32.760 --> 13:35.000
No, we're fine ...

13:37.440 --> 13:40.200
Well, they behave once in a while, you know.

13:40.360 --> 13:42.360
And then they're so ...

13:43.560 --> 13:48.040
... fucking annoying sometimes.
As always.

13:48.200 --> 13:50.960
Yeah, good for me, right. Really funny.

13:52.880 --> 13:57.320
You should look forward to
coming home to those crazy kids.

13:58.680 --> 14:00.680
Mommy!

14:04.320 --> 14:08.080
Elliot just woke up.
Could you call back in about two minutes?

14:10.800 --> 14:13.360
Okay. Okay.

14:13.520 --> 14:16.880
I love you too.
We'll talk soon.

14:17.040 --> 14:20.560
I will. Bye, babe.

15:13.440 --> 15:15.040
Lasse?

15:16.880 --> 15:18.800
What's going on?

15:25.200 --> 15:27.680
I want to go home.

15:33.560 --> 15:36.160
Since that morning with Anders ...

15:36.320 --> 15:40.840
He wasn't even supposed to be there.
He took my spot.

15:43.120 --> 15:45.760
And he was blown to pieces.

15:47.800 --> 15:52.360
I can't leave through these gates again.
I'm not worth two shits.

16:16.120 --> 16:18.880
I can't send you home.

16:22.680 --> 16:25.560
What I can do...

16:26.720 --> 16:29.960
... is give you assignments
inside the camp for the next two weeks.

16:32.120 --> 16:36.520
That way you won't have to leave
these gates for a while. And you can calm down.

16:37.920 --> 16:42.640
If you still feel down after a couple
of weeks, we'll talk again.

17:08.200 --> 17:10.320
Do you have any family?

17:12.360 --> 17:14.680
Siblings or the like?

17:14.840 --> 17:17.720
I have a younger sister.

17:17.880 --> 17:19.760
She's 16.

17:19.920 --> 17:23.160
– What's her name?
– Her name is Majida.

17:25.480 --> 17:28.280
She's starting high school soon.

17:30.360 --> 17:32.120
Fuck!

17:44.520 --> 17:46.120
Call home.

17:46.280 --> 17:50.640
I'll be back in 10 minutes
and we'll have some coffee.

18:08.160 --> 18:10.040
Hello?

18:11.040 --> 18:14.120
It's me. Hey.

18:15.720 --> 18:19.320
Switch, guys.

18:19.480 --> 18:22.400
– <i> Salam alaikum.
</i>– Hey, guys.

18:23.960 --> 18:26.040
<i>Salam, salam.</i>

18:27.680 --> 18:30.240
Wanna come along? No?

18:33.080 --> 18:35.280
Go away, go away!

18:35.840 --> 18:39.240
– Go away.
– Keep away.

18:40.560 --> 18:45.360
<i>Correct. EW reports,
that "the pale guys" are in the area.</i>

18:50.800 --> 18:52.960
(speaking Arabic)

18:59.400 --> 19:02.160
Stoffer, back in formation.

19:02.320 --> 19:05.560
– In front of Michael?
– At the back. Now!

19:05.720 --> 19:08.440
– Understood.
– Stoffer, go to the back now!

19:11.200 --> 19:14.320
– That's the last time that happens.
– Understood.

19:16.360 --> 19:19.080
– <i> 2–5, 6–0.
</i>– 2–5, over.

19:29.280 --> 19:32.080
<i>Stop! Get out here!</i>

19:32.240 --> 19:34.800
– <i> Get down!
</i>– What's going on?

19:34.960 --> 19:39.840
<i>Sit down!</i>  I need a translator!
<i> Sit down! Sit down!</i>

19:40.000 --> 19:42.640
Calm down. We need a translator right now.

19:42.800 --> 19:47.120
Calm down, Rytter. Ease off.
We need a translator here.

19:47.280 --> 19:50.320
Sit down, sit down.
Tell him to sit down.

19:51.480 --> 19:53.880
Tell him to lift that up.

19:54.040 --> 19:55.680
(Arabic)

19:55.840 --> 19:59.400
His daughter is ill.
He needs help.

19:59.560 --> 20:01.840
<i>Shut up!</i>

20:02.000 --> 20:05.720
– Get Rytter in line right now.
– Rytter, come here. This way.

20:05.880 --> 20:07.920
(Arabic)

20:08.080 --> 20:10.200
He says, his daughter ...

20:10.360 --> 20:13.640
"My daughter is ill.
Can you help me?"

20:13.800 --> 20:15.880
Where is his daughter?

20:16.040 --> 20:19.480
– She's inside the house.
– Anybody else in there?

20:19.640 --> 20:21.800
(Arabic)

20:21.960 --> 20:24.680
Tell him to calm the fuck down.

20:28.120 --> 20:32.200
"She was burned here.
Can you help us?"

20:32.360 --> 20:35.480
You have to calm down,
otherwise we can't help you.

20:35.640 --> 20:38.720
– There, straight ahead. There, left!

20:38.880 --> 20:42.760
– Our guys are behind that door.
– He says to stop.

20:42.920 --> 20:45.360
He has to remove the women first.

20:45.520 --> 20:49.360
– Look away.
– Look away? What do you think?

20:49.520 --> 20:51.520
Can you guys see anything?

20:51.680 --> 20:55.120
I can see two women.
Come on, dammit.

20:55.280 --> 20:58.640
– Easy, easy.
– "Come inside."

20:58.800 --> 21:00.680
Go away!

21:00.840 --> 21:04.080
There right,
and women behind the door straight ahead.

21:05.280 --> 21:07.400
There is a donkey over there.

21:07.560 --> 21:10.560
– You stay there.
– Is it in there?

21:11.520 --> 21:13.920
– Yes, that's his house.
– In here?

21:14.080 --> 21:16.440
Get over here.

21:22.000 --> 21:26.680
Confirmed. A mother and two children
and a girl with gauze on.

21:26.840 --> 21:29.760
Okay. Jones?
Jones, get up here, now.

21:30.960 --> 21:35.520
"Thank you for helping us.
We are poor people."

21:35.680 --> 21:38.760
– Is it a burn?
– Yes. Left forearm.

21:38.920 --> 21:41.120
<i>Salam alaikum.</i>

21:42.000 --> 21:47.240
– Tell him, he's welcome to enter.
– I need Stoffer in here right now.

21:47.400 --> 21:50.840
– What's he saying?
– "It's this girl."

21:56.760 --> 21:59.160
Can you open this?

21:59.320 --> 22:02.440
Can I take a look at that?
Can you ask her that?

22:04.840 --> 22:07.360
It's stuck in her wound.

22:09.400 --> 22:13.520
He has to tell the girl
it's going to hurt.

22:13.680 --> 22:16.720
And he needs to hold her arm.

22:24.440 --> 22:26.440
Yes, it hurts.

22:27.440 --> 22:29.360
There it is.

22:31.520 --> 22:33.560
It's badly inflamed.

22:33.720 --> 22:37.840
Tell him, I can only rinse it
with water. I don't have ...

22:41.840 --> 22:44.480
"What if it doesn't get better,
then what?"

22:44.640 --> 22:49.120
I'm gonna put it in gauze,
but he has to rinse it daily with soap.

22:58.040 --> 23:02.120
"Listen to her crying.
She can't sleep at night."

23:05.000 --> 23:08.960
Tell them, if it gets worse,
they can come to the camp.

23:14.400 --> 23:16.720
He knows where the camp is.

23:16.880 --> 23:19.120
"Thank you so much."

23:19.280 --> 23:22.400
There aren't any taliban here.
They're regular civilians.

23:22.560 --> 23:26.520
The taliban comes sometimes. When we
leave, they'll be here right away.

23:26.680 --> 23:30.080
– When were they here last?
– "As soon as you get here, they run away."

23:30.240 --> 23:33.640
If we help you with the well
and the water, –

23:33.800 --> 23:37.320
– could you help us with the mines?

23:37.480 --> 23:39.280
(Arabic)

23:51.160 --> 23:54.000
All they want is peace.

23:56.360 --> 23:58.160
(Arabic)

24:08.520 --> 24:10.880
He's ready for you down here.

24:11.480 --> 24:13.720
<i>One second, okay?</i>

24:16.960 --> 24:20.080
Okay, we're ready.

24:20.240 --> 24:22.400
<i>Ready? And up!</i>

25:21.840 --> 25:24.880
Hey, it's me. Hello?

25:25.040 --> 25:27.880
– <i> Hello?
</i>– Can you hear me?

25:28.040 --> 25:30.360
<i>Yeah, hi, baby.</i>

25:30.520 --> 25:33.720
Hey. Are you all there?

25:33.880 --> 25:38.560
– <i> Yes, it's me and Julius.
</i>– Where is Elliot and Figne?

25:38.720 --> 25:44.080
<i>Elliot's sleeping. Figne
doesn't want to talk today.</i>

25:46.000 --> 25:47.320
Okay.

25:47.480 --> 25:50.560
– Could I speak to Julius?
<i>– Yeah, he's right here.</i>

25:51.400 --> 25:53.200
<i>Daddy?</i>

25:53.360 --> 25:56.960
– How are you?
<i>– Good.</i>

25:57.120 --> 26:00.600
I'm sorry,
I didn't call last night, but ...

26:04.200 --> 26:06.160
<i>That's okay.</i>

26:06.320 --> 26:10.360
– And you're good?
– <i> Yes.</i>

26:10.520 --> 26:13.200
– Is that Maria?
– Julius.

26:15.200 --> 26:20.000
– Can I say hi?
– Someone wants to talk to you.

26:20.160 --> 26:24.640
– Hi, Julius.
– <i> Hi.</i>

26:24.800 --> 26:27.360
– How are you?
<i>– Good.</i>

26:27.520 --> 26:33.240
I seem to remember, you owing me
a joke. Is that right?

26:33.400 --> 26:34.960
<i>Yeah.</i>

26:36.440 --> 26:40.560
– You wanna tell it?
– <i> Yeah.</i>

26:42.840 --> 26:46.320
– Right now, or ...?
<i>– Yeah, now.</i>

26:46.480 --> 26:50.440
Alright, I'm listening.
I'm listening.

26:52.040 --> 26:53.720
<i>What?</i>

26:54.840 --> 26:57.640
<i>Julius, tell it.
Here he is.</i>

26:57.800 --> 26:59.760
Okay. Hi, Maria.

26:59.920 --> 27:03.400
<i>Once there was a boy
at the swimming pool.</i>

27:03.560 --> 27:07.280
<i>The lifeguard yelled at him:
"Don't pee in the water."</i>

27:07.440 --> 27:11.400
<i>And the boy said:
"All the others pee in the water, too."</i>

27:11.560 --> 27:14.920
<i>"Yeah, but not from the diving board"</i>

27:17.600 --> 27:20.760
Not from the diving board?
Was that what you said?

27:24.200 --> 27:26.480
That was really funny.

27:26.640 --> 27:30.440
You know what, you win.
It was a lot funnier than mine.

27:30.600 --> 27:34.800
– <i> Did you have a joke, Najib?
</i>– No, it was his turn.

27:34.960 --> 27:37.680
Well, I don't want to interrupt.
Take care.

27:37.840 --> 27:40.560
– <i> You too.
</i>– Goodbye, Julius.

27:42.360 --> 27:46.360
It's me again.
I love you.

27:46.520 --> 27:48.800
<i>We miss you, dad.</i>

28:06.520 --> 28:11.280
Have a good day.
Just run inside, okay? Julius?

28:11.440 --> 28:14.560
When you have binoculars, –

28:14.720 --> 28:18.200
– you point it at the wall ...

28:18.360 --> 28:21.480
Yes. Have a nice day.

28:21.640 --> 28:24.280
Julius, I don't have time for this.

28:24.440 --> 28:27.920
Don't do this.
I don't want to fight with you.

28:28.080 --> 28:30.680
Have a nice day, okay? Run along.

28:37.280 --> 28:42.280
No, you didn't just do that.
Why did you do that, Julius? Unlock the door.

28:51.200 --> 28:54.960
I asked you nicely.
I can't leave Elliot by himself.

28:55.120 --> 28:57.960
Come on. Go inside.

29:06.960 --> 29:09.960
Oh no, you don't! Alright, get out.

29:10.120 --> 29:14.520
Elliot, you'll have to sit
here by yourself. Come on.

29:23.040 --> 29:25.880
I have an RC here.

29:26.040 --> 29:30.680
Alright, you don't have to  <i>confirm</i>  any more.
Just retreat.

29:34.840 --> 29:37.960
– Down there.
– You can already see it from here.

29:40.520 --> 29:45.040
You can see the antenna there.
It looks like a 105 grenade.

29:45.200 --> 29:49.320
Good work, guys.
Get into position. Go back farther.

29:54.120 --> 29:56.960
Left of the children
down by the road –

29:57.120 --> 30:00.560
– we have a large artillery grenade.
Possible RC.

30:00.720 --> 30:04.840
I hesitate to send it to the TOC,
until we find out, what we have to do.

30:05.000 --> 30:09.480
I'm not so nervous about the danger,
because those girls stand so close to the road.

30:09.640 --> 30:12.960
As long as they're there,
anything rarely happens.

30:14.200 --> 30:16.680
– Butcher?
– What do you say, guys?

30:17.960 --> 30:21.680
Hotel 1–5, this is 6–5.
Come to my position.

30:23.160 --> 30:26.040
I'm walking here, Butcher.

30:27.800 --> 30:31.760
– What's your best position?
– By the rock up there.

30:31.920 --> 30:34.360
The rock up there?

30:34.520 --> 30:37.400
– Butcher and I will go with you.
– Understood.

30:49.360 --> 30:52.240
<i>6–5 Oscar, this is 6–0.</i>

30:52.400 --> 30:58.640
<i>We expect to have green light
in this area in 3–0 mike.</i>

30:58.800 --> 31:04.480
Copy that. We have gone into
position to monitor the IED we found.

31:04.640 --> 31:07.880
6–5 Papa has put
Hotel 1–5 into position. We'll ...

31:08.600 --> 31:11.760
<i>... stay here for the time being. Over.</i>

31:11.920 --> 31:14.360
<i>This is 6–0. Copy, out.</i>

31:46.200 --> 31:48.120
Do you hear that?

31:49.320 --> 31:50.840
Yeah.

31:53.280 --> 31:55.960
That's the sound of an engine.
He's there.

32:01.360 --> 32:04.040
6–5, Hotel 1–5. Over.

32:06.000 --> 32:08.200
<i>6–5 Oscar, Over.</i>

32:08.360 --> 32:11.680
We can see one pax on a vehicle.

32:11.840 --> 32:15.160
– Out.
– Take a 500 metre aim.

32:16.280 --> 32:20.560
500 aim, 45 up.
Maintaining line of fire.

32:23.960 --> 32:28.760
– <i> We have PID on a rifle. Over.
</i>– They ask about order of operations.

32:28.920 --> 32:31.800
– Await.
– <i> 6–5 Oscar. Report from Papa.</i>

32:31.960 --> 32:35.440
<i>Await until he has
made contact with the object.</i>

32:35.600 --> 32:38.520
Hotel 1–5, copy. Out.

32:40.000 --> 32:44.200
– What the hell is he doing?
– He's gathering the boys.

32:48.160 --> 32:51.240
– He's lining them up.
– God dammit ...

32:53.240 --> 32:57.600
And he starts digging.
Yes, I got it.  <i> Hostile intent.</i>

32:58.720 --> 33:02.640
He's digging up the object.
They await an order.

33:02.800 --> 33:06.360
Hotel 1–5, this is 6–5 Papa.
You have permission to fire.

33:06.520 --> 33:10.360
This is Hotel 1–5,
Copy. Out.

33:10.520 --> 33:12.560
– Can you get him?
– Yeah.

33:13.680 --> 33:15.640
Fuck ...

33:15.800 --> 33:18.360
He's taking a boy with him.

33:18.520 --> 33:23.440
<i>We don't have a free shot. He's taken
one of the boys and he's driving away.</i>

33:29.840 --> 33:33.400
– Where is he now?
– He's at about 5.

33:34.480 --> 33:36.840
– 500.
– 500.

33:37.880 --> 33:40.320
He's slowing down.

33:40.480 --> 33:43.200
Isn't he?
Yeah, he's stopping.

33:44.640 --> 33:48.160
– The boy runs away. This is it.
– Yes. Ready.

33:50.560 --> 33:52.840
Hold.

33:54.640 --> 33:56.280
Fire.

34:00.720 --> 34:04.000
– Hit. Ready to follow up.
– Ready to follow up.

34:05.160 --> 34:07.760
– 67 up.
– 67 up.

34:10.360 --> 34:14.040
– Five right.
– Five right. Ready to fire.

34:14.640 --> 34:16.080
Fire.

34:20.760 --> 34:22.760
Hit.

34:37.960 --> 34:42.120
Marius, how will you explain to
your son that you have shot Mr. Beard?

34:42.280 --> 34:45.160
I don't know.
B for Bang?

34:46.600 --> 34:49.240
D for Dead?

34:55.760 --> 34:59.840
Do you know what this is, Elliot?
Do you know what this is?

35:00.000 --> 35:02.000
– A shark.
– Yes.

35:03.160 --> 35:06.320
– And do you know what this is?
– A motorcycle.

35:06.480 --> 35:08.880
Yes. And do you know what this is?

35:09.040 --> 35:13.000
– A giraffe.
– Yes. Do you know what this is?

35:13.160 --> 35:15.480
– A space rocket.
– What?

35:15.640 --> 35:19.560
A space rocket. A space rocket!

35:19.720 --> 35:22.280
No, it's a spaceship.

35:22.440 --> 35:25.320
– Do you know what that is?
– That's daddy.

35:25.480 --> 35:29.040
– And what is that?
– That is a ...

35:29.200 --> 35:31.080
– Cannon.
– Cannon.

35:36.600 --> 35:40.680
– Figne, are you looking after Elliot?
– Yes!

35:55.360 --> 35:56.920
Hey.

35:57.880 --> 36:00.280
– Are you sad?
– No.

36:00.440 --> 36:04.520
– Have you had a good day at school?
– You don't need to ask about that.

36:04.680 --> 36:07.560
– Why?
– Because I can say it myself.

36:07.720 --> 36:12.480
I know, you rascal. I just want
to know that you are doing well.

36:12.640 --> 36:15.000
Aww. Did you hit your head?

36:16.320 --> 36:19.160
I just want to know
you feel good.

36:19.320 --> 36:22.680
You need to tell me if something's wrong.

36:22.840 --> 36:27.000
– When is dad coming home?
– Is that all you think about?

36:27.160 --> 36:28.720
Mhm.

36:31.800 --> 36:36.400
He'll be here in three months.
It's not so long.

36:36.560 --> 36:41.240
Can I get a hug? What do I have
to do to get a hug?

36:41.400 --> 36:44.280
Mom, Elliot has eaten something!

36:44.440 --> 36:46.920
– What did he eat?
– Mom!

36:48.080 --> 36:52.160
How many did you eat?
Elliot. Open your mouth.

36:55.040 --> 36:58.400
Is this Elliot?
The doctor is ready for you in room six.

36:59.680 --> 37:03.320
Figne, take this and go sit
in the waiting room, please.

37:03.480 --> 37:06.720
I'll be back as soon as possible.
Keep an eye on Julius, okay?

37:12.200 --> 37:15.040
He ate some paracetamol?

37:15.200 --> 37:19.600
Yeah, he puked some out, but I
don't know how many he has eaten.

37:19.760 --> 37:22.880
I'm just gonna put
a bandaid on your chest.

37:23.040 --> 37:26.640
We have to probe him,
so we can monitor him.

37:26.800 --> 37:30.400
And we have put in an NAC drop
and give him some charcoal.

37:30.560 --> 37:34.240
– I want my daddy ...
– He's not here right now, honey.

37:35.760 --> 37:40.080
Now you look here, Elliot.
This is going in your mouth.

37:41.320 --> 37:44.000
It'll be uncomfortable for a moment, –

37:44.160 --> 37:47.840
– but we have to do it, so we
can get all the pills up.

37:49.000 --> 37:52.520
– And here it comes down into your stomach.
– I'll take the pacifier.

37:52.680 --> 37:56.640
It will be a bit uncomfortable,
but your mother will be right here the whole time.

37:56.800 --> 37:59.920
Sit here, please.

38:00.080 --> 38:04.080
And now it's important, Elliot,
that you lie completely still and open wide.

38:04.240 --> 38:07.400
– Open the mouth. And suction.
– You are so good.

38:07.560 --> 38:09.600
And we have suction.

38:30.400 --> 38:33.360
Let's see if we can't
wake them up.

38:33.520 --> 38:35.120
Figne?

39:00.040 --> 39:01.800
Hey, sweetie.

39:03.240 --> 39:07.440
Honey, don't cry.
I wish that I was there.

39:08.840 --> 39:11.520
Maria ... Maria?

39:23.240 --> 39:25.640
I'll take the fives.

39:36.200 --> 39:39.640
– Need some sleep?
– No, I'm fine.

39:44.280 --> 39:47.440
– You have a lot on your plate right now.
– Yeah.

39:47.600 --> 39:51.280
When are you gonna stop going on patrol?

39:53.480 --> 39:55.600
Full House, 24

40:13.680 --> 40:15.760
Look at this.

40:23.040 --> 40:25.320
I'll report it to 3-5.

40:25.480 --> 40:29.840
3-5, this is <i> main gate.
</i> We have civilians headed towards <i> main gate. </i>

40:31.560 --> 40:33.160
<i> Copy that. </i>

40:42.040 --> 40:44.800
– I'll stand on the left.
– Copy.

40:51.200 --> 40:54.680
6-0, this is 3-5.
The four locals are now in London.

40:54.840 --> 40:58.480
They've been searched.
I'm here with the translator. Out.

40:58.640 --> 41:00.600
Lars, close the gate.

41:00.760 --> 41:02.920
(Arabic)

41:06.240 --> 41:09.240
He says he has spoken to
our commander.

41:09.400 --> 41:13.600
If the Taliban were after them
that he would help.

41:13.760 --> 41:15.720
Copy that..

41:15.880 --> 41:20.720
6-0, this is 3-5. Local
Afghan man approximately 60-65 years old

41:20.880 --> 41:25.320
– seems to know "the commander".
He must be referring to KC.

41:29.680 --> 41:31.880
<i> Asalamu alaikum. </i>

41:45.600 --> 41:50.800
Although you patrol at day,
the Taliban comes at night.

41:50.960 --> 41:54.320
He says that the Taliban know
we helped his daughter.

41:54.480 --> 41:58.840
Now they want him to be a warrior for them,
otherwise they'll kill his family.

41:59.920 --> 42:04.320
Tell him that we'll come tomorrow
and force the Taliban away from the area.

42:04.480 --> 42:06.360
(Arabic)

42:13.800 --> 42:17.720
"I can't go home. We
have to stay here tonight."

42:20.640 --> 42:23.760
I'm sorry,
but I have to ...

42:26.360 --> 42:30.000
I'm sorry.
You have to go home now.

42:33.000 --> 42:35.240
Put your boy down.

42:35.400 --> 42:37.600
Put him down.

42:40.920 --> 42:42.880
Wait, wait.

42:50.320 --> 42:54.200
I myself have three children.
(translator translates)

42:54.360 --> 42:57.200
I understand your situation.

42:57.360 --> 43:01.720
But in order for us to help you,
you will have to go home.

43:06.000 --> 43:08.720
"Your children live in safety though."

43:10.640 --> 43:14.400
He says that if they go back,
they will be killed.

43:18.120 --> 43:20.720
"Take care of the children, and I'll leave."

43:21.560 --> 43:26.120
His children will be killed. We have
to go to the village in the morning anyway...

43:26.280 --> 43:28.520
Stop that right now.

43:33.920 --> 43:36.080
"What should I do?"

43:36.240 --> 43:40.120
We will be there tomorrow. We'll secure
the area, and force the Taliban out.

43:40.280 --> 43:44.800
We'll protect you
and your family. You have my word.

43:45.600 --> 43:48.640
Rytter, ready the gate.

44:15.720 --> 44:17.880
They can't stay here.

44:30.840 --> 44:34.280
There have been a low number of
<i> incidents </i> in AO.

44:34.440 --> 44:38.760
The assessment is, that they are waiting until
they understand our intention in the area.

44:38.920 --> 44:42.720
There has been
massive digging activity out there –

44:42.880 --> 44:46.920
– and they undoubtedly monitor
our every move.

44:47.080 --> 44:51.160
It's my job to be the merchant of death
as an intelligence officer.

44:51.320 --> 44:54.880
It won't be long
before we see a reaction.

45:02.480 --> 45:05.560
They report that it is
very quiet down there today.

45:05.720 --> 45:09.600
It could be a <i> combat indicator,
</i> that the locals have left the area.

45:09.760 --> 45:12.480
The Taliban may be ready
and waiting for us.

45:12.640 --> 45:15.600
If they are,
we'll just have to remove them.

45:16.680 --> 45:19.240
– Any risk reports?
– None.

45:19.400 --> 45:23.200
We're going down to see that family.
I'll take Lars, Jones, –

45:23.360 --> 45:27.280
– Michael, Butcher,
Stoffer and Lasse with me.

45:28.400 --> 45:32.320
We'll enter Compound 3 and
look in on the family.

45:32.480 --> 45:36.280
You'll continue to the other side,
and back us up from there.

45:37.960 --> 45:41.320
Look at this.
We'll all go down to the well.

45:41.480 --> 45:46.840
From the well, you'll go directly south
gain insight on Compounds 6, 7 and 8.

45:47.000 --> 45:48.880
Copy.

45:50.080 --> 45:52.320
6-0, 6-5 Oscar, Over.

45:52.480 --> 45:57.000
2-5 reporting,
very low levels of activity. Over.

45:58.360 --> 46:00.520
<i> We are monitoring you – </i>

46:00.680 --> 46:05.280
<i> – and don't have indications
of activity, either. Copy. Out. </i>

46:10.480 --> 46:14.400
Say that we are going in with weapons,
unless they say something.

46:14.560 --> 46:17.000
(interpreter in Arabic)

46:22.160 --> 46:24.880
– Room on the right.
– Blue door straight ahead.

46:28.720 --> 46:31.080
Room clear.

46:31.240 --> 46:33.240
Focus on the blue door.

46:49.440 --> 46:51.480
Fuck ...

47:03.080 --> 47:05.280
<i> This is 6-0. </i>

47:05.440 --> 47:10.360
We're here. The aforementioned family,
we helped, we've localized them.

47:11.480 --> 47:14.800
They've all been killed.

47:25.400 --> 47:28.200
The boy was shot in the head.

47:28.360 --> 47:33.040
The girl was shot two three times
in the chest and neck.

47:35.840 --> 47:38.560
The mother was hit in the face.

47:44.080 --> 47:48.080
Take Lasse to 2-5. There is no
reason for him to be here.

47:48.800 --> 47:51.440
We'll come to you,
when we're done.

47:51.600 --> 47:53.960
Lasse. Lasse.

47:54.720 --> 47:56.480
Come here.

48:00.760 --> 48:03.200
Look at me. Are you alright?

48:05.200 --> 48:06.640
<i> 6-0. Over. </i>

48:06.800 --> 48:10.200
We'll stay for an additional 05
and then leave the village –

48:10.360 --> 48:14.240
– and go back
toward London. Confirm. Over.

48:14.400 --> 48:17.440
<i> This is 6-0. Copy that. Out. </i>

48:18.800 --> 48:20.640
(explosion)

48:20.800 --> 48:23.320
Get away, Jones!

48:23.480 --> 48:26.600
6-0, 6-5 Oscar. Out.

48:28.760 --> 48:31.280
– Can you see anything?
– No.

48:31.440 --> 48:34.920
– What about 2-5?
– 2-5 has our backs.

48:35.080 --> 48:37.680
<i> Can you gain insight? </i>

48:37.840 --> 48:41.800
I see nothing. All I see is
it's coming from the left side.

48:41.960 --> 48:45.120
– 2-5 has no insight!
– 2-5 has no insight.

48:45.280 --> 48:49.120
– I think the sound came from Compound 6
– There's nothing to see there.

48:50.600 --> 48:53.200
Boss! Lasse is hit!

48:53.360 --> 48:56.480
– What's the position?
– Give position.

48:56.640 --> 49:00.240
– <i> I'm by the well!
</i> – He's out by the well.

49:01.280 --> 49:03.560
2-5 has no insight!

49:06.200 --> 49:10.440
– Michael!
– He was hit in the neck! Help me!

49:12.520 --> 49:14.920
I need help right now!

49:18.760 --> 49:21.440
– Where was he hit?
– In the neck.

49:21.600 --> 49:23.960
Lasse, Lasse! Look at me!

49:24.120 --> 49:26.920
He's good. Let's take
him over here. Come on.

49:30.080 --> 49:33.320
– Michael, secure it.
– Got it. <i> Go! </i>

49:39.560 --> 49:42.280
– Butcher!
– Butcher's coming!

49:45.200 --> 49:48.320
– Jones! Where do you want him?
– Up here!

49:49.360 --> 49:53.920
Where was he hit?
Keep the pressure.

49:54.080 --> 49:58.920
2-5, this is 6-5. Send me a sitrep.
Are you in contact? Over.

49:59.080 --> 50:02.560
– <i> This is 2-5. This is 2-5.
</i> – Stoffer!

50:02.720 --> 50:06.440
<i> They are firing from several
directions. I have no insight. </i>

50:06.600 --> 50:09.240
I've got you.

50:09.400 --> 50:13.080
Lasse, we are gonna cut up your shirt,
so Jones can check on you.

50:13.240 --> 50:17.520
Jones has to check on you.
Lasse? I've got you.

50:17.680 --> 50:22.520
– Where is that fucking medevac?!
– Michael, where can it set down?

50:22.680 --> 50:25.040
On the north side of the village.

50:25.200 --> 50:29.000
2-5, we have to sweep
a landing site. Get it going.

50:30.400 --> 50:33.800
<i> 2-5, I am engaged.
I can't do it. </i>

50:33.960 --> 50:38.720
– I've got you, Lasse.
– We need that fucking medevac!

50:38.880 --> 50:40.360
Get down!

50:44.600 --> 50:48.280
– Lars! Michael! Is everything alright?
– Yes. I don't see anything.

50:48.440 --> 50:53.240
2-5, this is 6-5. We have to sweep
a landing site. Reply, dammit!

50:53.400 --> 50:56.680
<i> This is 2-5.
I can't do it. Out. </i>

50:56.840 --> 50:59.800
– Hold it tight.
– Lasse, look at me. Are you there?

51:00.480 --> 51:04.120
Lasse, look at me.
You'll make it. We are getting you home.

51:04.280 --> 51:07.120
– Are you there, Lasse?
– Lasse!

51:07.280 --> 51:10.040
Lars and Michael, behind you!

51:10.200 --> 51:13.280
– Insight?
– That direction plus 200.

51:14.880 --> 51:19.160
2-5, I need a clear
enemy report. Come on!

51:19.320 --> 51:23.200
<i> I don't have a clear enemy report.
They are in a western direction. </i>

51:23.360 --> 51:25.520
Western direction?

51:27.600 --> 51:32.400
Where the hell are they?
Lars, I'm behind you. Insight?

51:32.560 --> 51:35.200
– Negative.
– Same as Lars.

51:35.360 --> 51:36.680
RPG!

51:40.480 --> 51:42.520
– I'm okay.
– Michael?

51:42.680 --> 51:45.200
Butcher, this is critical!

51:45.360 --> 51:49.920
– We need air support.
– 6-0, we need air support.

51:50.080 --> 51:52.880
His heart rate is dropping!
He's getting worse.

51:53.040 --> 51:55.800
Verify coordinate Compound 6.

51:55.960 --> 51:59.600
On the six?
I've got it.

51:59.760 --> 52:03.160
– Lasse!
– What's happening, Jones?

52:03.320 --> 52:06.360
– Lasse, look up.
– Lasse, look at us!

52:06.520 --> 52:08.400
What's going on?

52:08.560 --> 52:11.600
We're not getting air support,
unless we have PID.

52:11.760 --> 52:15.040
– We need to get Lasse out of here.
– 7-5 wants to know who's in there.

52:15.200 --> 52:19.040
– I don't give a shit who's in there!
– I know, but it's 7-5 asking!

52:19.200 --> 52:23.000
Then tell them, I know who's in there!
We have to get out of here!

52:24.200 --> 52:27.920
We have PID on Compound 6.
Repeat: PID on Compound 6.

52:28.680 --> 52:31.240
Come on, god dammit!

52:32.280 --> 52:35.240
– 0-2 mike!
– 0-2 mike on air support!

52:35.400 --> 52:36.840
Jones!

52:37.520 --> 52:41.640
– Come on. Lasse, look at me.
– One, two, three!

52:41.800 --> 52:45.320
– Now look at me. There we go!
– He's back!

52:45.480 --> 52:47.880
Pancake around 15 Sierra!

52:51.440 --> 52:53.920
<i> Three, two, one ... </i>

52:54.760 --> 52:56.840
(explosion)

53:04.800 --> 53:07.800
– Lasse, come on.
– I'll get the door.

53:07.960 --> 53:11.040
– Come on, Lasse!
– Nice and easy.

53:12.600 --> 53:15.840
– Lay him down.
– Hold his head.

53:16.880 --> 53:20.920
– Is there a helicopter for Lasse now?
– I have him right here.

53:21.080 --> 53:23.640
Easy. Easy, Stoffer.

53:23.800 --> 53:25.760
Step away, please.

53:25.920 --> 53:27.960
Breathe.

53:28.120 --> 53:31.360
Jones, we need you
in position.

53:31.520 --> 53:34.480
– Come on, Lasse!
– Protect him from the wind.

53:34.640 --> 53:37.320
Sit down. Nice and easy.

53:37.480 --> 53:40.040
Loosen the helmet a bit.

53:40.200 --> 53:42.960
You'll get some air.
That's okay.

53:44.160 --> 53:46.200
It's alright.

53:47.160 --> 53:49.480
Okay? Good work.

53:49.640 --> 53:53.280
Okay?
He'll be fine.

53:53.440 --> 53:56.080
It's alright to be sad.

53:56.240 --> 53:59.680
We're all sad.
It's completely alright.

54:01.600 --> 54:04.960
Stoffer, it'll be okay.
It'll be okay.

54:58.160 --> 55:02.040
– <i> Hey, hey! Get out of ...
</i> – Out of the vehicle. Let's go!

55:02.200 --> 55:06.480
– There must be something ...
– I'll get him from the other side.

55:08.200 --> 55:12.320
– Some guy has locked himself inside.
– I can see him through the window.

55:12.480 --> 55:15.400
Out! Out! Out!

55:15.560 --> 55:18.680
– <i> Out of the car. Now.
</i> – Get out.

55:20.640 --> 55:23.480
– No, there.
– Get him to lie down.

55:23.640 --> 55:26.400
– Get him down.
– I have him under control.

55:27.480 --> 55:31.880
Stay still, buddy. Okay?
Stay still!

55:35.960 --> 55:38.760
Nice and easy, buddy, alright?

55:41.920 --> 55:46.680
– 50% on the vehicle.
– Butcher, 50% on pat down!

55:46.840 --> 55:49.560
Stay still.

55:49.720 --> 55:53.160
Michael, we have a mobile phone.
Good work, boys.

55:53.320 --> 55:56.000
Now Michael will just
get the last E in.

55:56.160 --> 56:01.360
Just as soon as we are done here
get them into the vehicle, and point them north.

56:02.280 --> 56:03.480
(Arabic)

56:03.640 --> 56:07.760
Now, do what I tell you.
I don't want any bullshit from you.

56:07.920 --> 56:10.800
Raven will follow them north.

56:10.960 --> 56:14.600
The mobile phone was clean.
Expect to release them in 02.

56:18.920 --> 56:23.280
<i> Please stand up. </i> Get up, guys.
You know what that means. Come on!

56:24.080 --> 56:25.960
Copy that.

56:26.120 --> 56:29.840
We'll release them in 01
So if you can follow them ...

56:45.520 --> 56:49.280
As you know,
Lasse was hit in the neck –

56:49.440 --> 56:53.480
– and flown to Bastion. Then
he was flown to England –

56:54.760 --> 56:58.000
– where they patched him up.

57:14.260 --> 57:19.260
I miss you

57:19.270 --> 57:20.960
NOT!

57:26.270 --> 57:28.260
Can't eat

57:31.270 --> 57:34.660
But the food is also

57:38.760 --> 57:41.660
really shitty!

57:44.640 --> 57:46.320
Awesome.

57:47.640 --> 57:49.320
Thanks, boss

57:51.320 --> 57:52.620
I heard that you

57:56.320 --> 57:58.120
saved my life

58:05.320 --> 58:07.120
Look out for each other

58:36.280 --> 58:38.720
– There's more.
– A sponge cake?

58:38.880 --> 58:42.360
– Now there's more cake for you.
– It's a new one.

58:42.520 --> 58:45.160
Another one. That makes it a 1000. Yay!

58:45.320 --> 58:50.720
Oh, thank you. Come here. I'm keeping this.
I want this for myself.

58:50.880 --> 58:54.040
– Is he coming home for Christmas?
– Yes.

58:55.920 --> 58:59.480
– Whoops.
– It's amazing how you can keep it up.

59:00.640 --> 59:05.560
That's just ...
That's just the way, it is.

59:08.080 --> 59:13.040
– But Julius is reacting a bit these days.
– How so?

59:13.200 --> 59:15.880
Trouble at school and such.

59:16.040 --> 59:19.920
He just needs to adjust.

59:20.960 --> 59:26.320
He's at an age
where he starts to understand more ...

59:26.480 --> 59:29.760
... can express it more.

59:48.520 --> 59:52.720
Did you hear that my guys
made a deal with the locals?

59:52.880 --> 59:55.640
They bought a goat
and named it Richard.

59:59.640 --> 1:00:01.360
Where is it?

1:00:01.520 --> 1:00:05.520
In a small enclosure next to my bunk.

1:00:05.680 --> 1:00:08.920
I've seen more meat on a bouillon cube.

1:00:09.080 --> 1:00:13.200
– Do you have two minutes?
– Now?

1:00:13.360 --> 1:00:15.960
– Ten minutes.
– Alright.

1:00:17.920 --> 1:00:21.360
– What's going on?
– The commander is in your office.

1:00:21.520 --> 1:00:24.200
Got two guys from the Advocate Corps with him.

1:00:26.720 --> 1:00:28.640
What's it about?

1:00:30.000 --> 1:00:31.880
I don't know.

1:00:34.840 --> 1:00:36.800
Okay. Thanks.

1:00:44.440 --> 1:00:47.040
– Hey, Claus.
– Commander.

1:00:49.680 --> 1:00:51.520
What's this about?

1:00:51.680 --> 1:00:56.440
We have to interview you about
some claims regarding civilian casualties.

1:00:56.600 --> 1:01:01.000
Although you are not charged, you
have the right to remain silent.

1:01:01.160 --> 1:01:05.560
But we can't promise you won't
be charged at a later point in time.

1:01:07.720 --> 1:01:10.280
What would I be charged for?

1:01:10.440 --> 1:01:14.640
So you want to make a statement,
do I have that right?

1:01:20.160 --> 1:01:21.880
Yes.

1:01:34.440 --> 1:01:36.360
What do you want to ask about?

1:01:36.520 --> 1:01:40.520
Can you confirm that you and your men
were present in Adam Khan Kalay –

1:01:40.680 --> 1:01:43.560
– on September 21 at 9:30?

1:01:43.720 --> 1:01:45.840
I can confirm that.

1:01:46.000 --> 1:01:50.720
We have been told that you
gave orders to attack Compound 6.

1:01:50.880 --> 1:01:53.320
– Is that correct?
– Yes.

1:01:53.480 --> 1:01:56.000
We were in close contact with the enemy.

1:01:56.160 --> 1:01:59.640
And the enemy, that you refer to,
was located in Compound 6?

1:02:01.080 --> 1:02:04.480
Yes. That's why,
we called for air support on it.

1:02:55.920 --> 1:02:58.800
You are charged with bombing
a civilian target –

1:02:58.960 --> 1:03:03.240
– and thus caused the deaths
of 11 civilians.

1:03:03.400 --> 1:03:05.640
What does that mean?

1:03:06.800 --> 1:03:09.800
It means you are going home, Claus.

1:04:28.880 --> 1:04:30.680
There he is.

1:04:33.280 --> 1:04:36.240
I want to hug him first.

1:04:56.880 --> 1:04:59.920
– Are you gonna get that, Figne?
– No, I will.

1:05:00.080 --> 1:05:02.200
I'm a manly man.

1:05:02.360 --> 1:05:05.720
– I'll get it.
– Are you sure? Let's go.

1:05:07.120 --> 1:05:10.680
– I can't do it!
– I thought you were a man.

1:05:15.360 --> 1:05:18.840
– What's in it?
– I'll get it.

1:05:25.240 --> 1:05:30.320
We'll put the grey one here
and a white one on each side.

1:05:32.560 --> 1:05:35.240
Thanks. There!

1:05:35.400 --> 1:05:39.160
Then we'll ... Which one
should we put there?

1:05:42.640 --> 1:05:45.640
Those. We should get those.

1:05:49.480 --> 1:05:51.360
Is he asleep?

1:05:51.520 --> 1:05:54.520
– I'm not asleep.
– No, Elliot.

1:05:57.840 --> 1:06:02.320
We'll have an orange one there
and there.

1:06:07.440 --> 1:06:10.880
I'm almost done.
Can I see yours?

1:06:11.040 --> 1:06:14.160
– We are almost done.
– You are such a little rascal.

1:06:15.360 --> 1:06:17.320
You are so silly.

1:07:16.120 --> 1:07:19.720
You need to tell me
why you've come home.

1:07:32.560 --> 1:07:34.600
I'm cold.

1:08:28.440 --> 1:08:33.720
I've received the case files:
testimony from your men, –

1:08:33.880 --> 1:08:38.120
– a video from a helmet cam, in which
you give the order for the attack on Compound 6.

1:08:38.280 --> 1:08:40.640
And some photographs.

1:08:40.800 --> 1:08:45.080
I will contest their authenticity. I'll
to have them thrown out, –

1:08:45.240 --> 1:08:48.120
– because we have no idea
who has taken them –

1:08:48.280 --> 1:08:51.800
– although they claim,
they were taken at the scene of the crime.

1:08:51.960 --> 1:08:55.880
Their claim is that you
ordered a bombing of a civilian target –

1:08:56.040 --> 1:08:58.360
– without PID.

1:08:58.520 --> 1:09:02.840
– What is PID?
– It means if I saw the enemy there.

1:09:03.000 --> 1:09:07.480
You are accused of violating
the Military Criminal Code, ¤ 36.2.

1:09:07.640 --> 1:09:09.800
And what does that mean exactly?

1:09:09.960 --> 1:09:16.000
It means that you have been
accused of killing civilians.

1:09:16.160 --> 1:09:18.720
What is the penalty for that?

1:09:18.880 --> 1:09:23.280
It will probably be a jury trial,
in which the maximum penalty is four years.

1:09:23.440 --> 1:09:26.480
But let's not anticipate events.

1:09:26.640 --> 1:09:28.160
What do we do now?

1:09:28.320 --> 1:09:30.960
The most important question is, –

1:09:31.120 --> 1:09:35.320
– if Compound 6
was a military or a civilian target.

1:09:37.040 --> 1:09:39.400
That's the whole case.

1:09:39.560 --> 1:09:41.680
Did you have PID, Claus?

1:09:42.760 --> 1:09:46.680
I had a strong assumption
that the Taliban where...

1:09:46.840 --> 1:09:50.760
– I'll have to stop you right there. Did you have PID?
– I had a strong ...

1:09:50.920 --> 1:09:56.120
I gotta stop you again.
You need to understand that, right now, –

1:09:56.280 --> 1:10:01.240
– it's assumed to be a civilian target.
People live there.

1:10:01.400 --> 1:10:04.680
People's homes were bombed.

1:10:04.840 --> 1:10:08.320
As far as I can tell from
the witness reports, –

1:10:08.480 --> 1:10:12.240
– nothing indicates,
that you had PID.

1:10:12.400 --> 1:10:16.320
Does that matter? He says,
his men are wounded and bleeding.

1:10:16.480 --> 1:10:21.800
– It's his duty to save them.
– I understand that very well.

1:10:21.960 --> 1:10:25.720
But you have to understand, that to everyone
else, Claus is a soldier –

1:10:25.880 --> 1:10:28.720
– who killed 11 people.

1:10:33.520 --> 1:10:36.920
Alright. Let me be
completely honest with you.

1:10:38.520 --> 1:10:41.520
In this store
I sell acquittals.

1:10:41.680 --> 1:10:44.560
Morality and ethics
is not my department.

1:10:44.720 --> 1:10:49.680
The prosecution will claim,
that the case is about 11 dead civilians.

1:10:49.840 --> 1:10:53.080
If you have even the slightest doubt,
that you had PID, –

1:10:53.240 --> 1:10:55.560
– they will try to get you convicted.

1:10:55.720 --> 1:10:59.440
If you can say to me now
without a doubt that you had PID, –

1:10:59.600 --> 1:11:03.880
– there is a very good chance
I can get you acquitted.

1:11:04.040 --> 1:11:05.960
It's that simple.

1:11:12.640 --> 1:11:15.200
I can't just lie.

1:11:16.520 --> 1:11:20.320
I didn't know,
who was in that house, Maria.

1:11:20.480 --> 1:11:24.440
It was my responsibility, and I have
to suffer the consequences.

1:11:24.600 --> 1:11:27.600
<i>You </i> must suffer the consequences?

1:11:29.320 --> 1:11:31.640
What about the children?

1:11:32.960 --> 1:11:34.840
What about me?

1:11:38.000 --> 1:11:43.040
We need you at home.
You have been gone for a very long time.

1:11:44.080 --> 1:11:48.560
– Julius is struggling with it.
– What the hell was I supposed to do?

1:11:48.720 --> 1:11:50.120
Huh?

1:11:50.960 --> 1:11:55.120
It's not about what you were supposed
to do, but what you do right now.

1:11:57.640 --> 1:12:00.760
Would it help you
to go to prison for four years?

1:12:00.920 --> 1:12:03.840
Would you get better?
Would the children get better?

1:12:04.000 --> 1:12:07.960
We need you at home!
The children need you!

1:12:09.320 --> 1:12:12.160
I dropped that bomb.

1:12:14.400 --> 1:12:16.880
It was my decision.

1:12:18.160 --> 1:12:22.800
– I can't just blame my men.
– Alright, but then do what he says.

1:12:22.960 --> 1:12:27.400
Say you had fucking PID. Say,
you can't remember who confirmed it.

1:12:27.560 --> 1:12:32.080
Maybe you killed eight children,
but you have three living ones at home!

1:12:33.560 --> 1:12:35.280
I'm sorry.

1:14:15.040 --> 1:14:18.600
Claus, we'll go over here.
Maria, you have to sit over there.

1:14:18.760 --> 1:14:22.120
– Hey, boss. Good to see you.
– Hi.

1:14:27.200 --> 1:14:28.760
Hello.

1:14:33.400 --> 1:14:37.320
– Can I take your coat?
– How sweet. Thanks.

1:14:41.520 --> 1:14:44.000
That's your seat, Claus.

1:14:45.680 --> 1:14:49.200
You can just put your jacket here.

1:14:55.160 --> 1:14:57.240
Thanks.

1:14:57.400 --> 1:14:59.680
Take a seat, please.

1:15:06.080 --> 1:15:09.840
Remember what we talked about.
When it gets hard, –

1:15:10.000 --> 1:15:14.240
– look at me and breathe, okay?

1:15:15.240 --> 1:15:17.840
It'll be alright.

1:15:32.600 --> 1:15:34.800
Claus, stand up.

1:15:37.640 --> 1:15:41.160
– Good morning. Please be seated.
– Thank you.

1:15:44.680 --> 1:15:47.520
Alright, today we're processing the case –

1:15:47.680 --> 1:15:53.680
– the Military Prosecution Service
versus Claus Michael Pedersen.

1:15:53.840 --> 1:15:56.520
Claus Michael Pedersen,
is that you?

1:15:56.680 --> 1:15:58.320
– Yes.
– Good.

1:15:58.480 --> 1:16:02.000
– Tell me when you were born.
– 04-02-80.

1:16:02.160 --> 1:16:06.320
Yes, that is correct. And we can continue
the case with a statement.

1:16:06.480 --> 1:16:08.480
Can I interrupt for a moment.

1:16:08.640 --> 1:16:12.240
The prosecution's evidence involves
these photographs, –

1:16:12.400 --> 1:16:15.840
– specifically, exhibit 35.

1:16:16.000 --> 1:16:19.840
I would like to question the
authenticity of these photographs, –

1:16:20.000 --> 1:16:23.080
– and I ask the court
to make them inadmissible.

1:16:23.240 --> 1:16:26.480
Alright.
And what do you say?

1:16:26.640 --> 1:16:28.920
I don't agree.

1:16:29.080 --> 1:16:32.720
I will explain how we
acquired the photographs, –

1:16:32.880 --> 1:16:38.000
– and the authenticity of the photographs
was verified by the military police.

1:16:38.160 --> 1:16:42.960
Okay. Do you have any other remarks on your part?

1:16:43.120 --> 1:16:45.200
– No.

1:16:45.360 --> 1:16:48.000
This case is about –

1:16:48.160 --> 1:16:52.800
– whether the defendant had the necessary
information to give orders to bomb, –

1:16:52.960 --> 1:16:56.240
– if Compound 6 a military target or not.

1:16:56.400 --> 1:17:01.120
A recording from the helmet camera of
constable Lars Holm plays an important part –

1:17:01.280 --> 1:17:05.920
– to the military prosecution.
That is the exhibit 27.

1:17:06.080 --> 1:17:10.160
It is the opinion of the prosecution –

1:17:10.320 --> 1:17:15.720
– that the video clip shows
the basis of the decision of the defendant ...

1:17:15.880 --> 1:17:19.800
... Or lack thereof.
I will now play the video.

1:17:24.000 --> 1:17:28.000
<i> 6-5 Oscar, out. We're not
getting air support, unless we have PID. </i>

1:17:28.160 --> 1:17:30.480
<i> The TOC must be sure. </i>

1:17:30.640 --> 1:17:34.640
– <i> 7-5 wants to know who's in there.
</i> – <i> I don't give a shit who's in there! </i>

1:17:34.800 --> 1:17:36.960
<i> I know, but it's 7-5 asking! </i>

1:17:37.120 --> 1:17:41.560
<i>Then tell them, I know who's in there!
We have to get out of here!</i>

1:17:41.720 --> 1:17:46.240
<i> We have PID on Compound 6.
Repeat: PID on Compound 6. </i>

1:17:46.400 --> 1:17:49.040
Alright, thank you.

1:17:49.200 --> 1:17:52.480
In closing, there is the
photographic material –

1:17:52.640 --> 1:17:57.440
– delivered to the military police
in the English brigade.

1:17:57.600 --> 1:18:01.600
They then transferred the material
to the Danish military police.

1:18:01.760 --> 1:18:04.320
It's six photos.

1:18:04.480 --> 1:18:09.160
I have to warn you that,
these are explicit images.

1:18:09.320 --> 1:18:11.840
Begin.

1:18:13.200 --> 1:18:15.200
Yes. Photo number one.

1:18:19.720 --> 1:18:21.520
And photo number two.

1:18:24.360 --> 1:18:26.400
Photo number three.

1:18:28.080 --> 1:18:30.160
And number four.

1:18:33.360 --> 1:18:35.080
Number five.

1:18:39.320 --> 1:18:41.360
And ... photo number six.

1:18:47.080 --> 1:18:48.440
Thank you.

1:18:48.600 --> 1:18:52.480
Does the defence have any comments?

1:18:52.640 --> 1:18:53.880
No.

1:18:54.040 --> 1:18:57.520
Alright, then we'll move on to the witnesses.

1:18:58.880 --> 1:19:02.200
Jones is screaming.
Lasse's condition is critical, –

1:19:02.360 --> 1:19:06.360
– so we call in a medevac
to get him out.

1:19:06.520 --> 1:19:10.160
Immediately thereafter
we were hit by yet another grenade.

1:19:10.320 --> 1:19:13.400
I attempt to gain insight
but I can't, –

1:19:13.560 --> 1:19:17.240
– so I seek cover by this wall
in the southwest corner –

1:19:17.400 --> 1:19:20.000
– of Compound 3
with Butcher.

1:19:20.160 --> 1:19:23.480
Butcher is Kenneth Jensen,
the communications officer?

1:19:23.640 --> 1:19:25.640
Yes, Kenneth Jensen.

1:19:25.800 --> 1:19:30.280
Then I get a report that
the Taliban are in Compound 6.

1:19:30.440 --> 1:19:34.280
Okay. Claus, at what time exactly ...

1:19:35.440 --> 1:19:39.360
... are you informed,
that the enemy is in Compound 6?

1:19:39.520 --> 1:19:42.040
I don't remember exactly.

1:19:42.200 --> 1:19:46.360
But you remember, that you have identified
Compound 6 as a military target?

1:19:46.520 --> 1:19:48.360
Yes.

1:19:49.760 --> 1:19:53.360
Alright. Before we continue,
you can just sit back down.

1:19:53.520 --> 1:19:57.240
I think we have a good overview
of the circumstances.

1:19:58.080 --> 1:19:59.800
Thank you.

1:20:00.800 --> 1:20:04.160
(whispering)
Let's just continue down this road.

1:20:06.160 --> 1:20:08.600
Alright.

1:20:08.760 --> 1:20:12.360
I would like to quote from exhibit 27a:

1:20:12.520 --> 1:20:16.120
"I don't give a shit who's
in there. We need to get Lasse out. "

1:20:16.280 --> 1:20:21.400
And shortly thereafter: "Tell them I know who's
in there. We have to get out of here."

1:20:23.240 --> 1:20:26.400
This is contrary to what you said.

1:20:26.560 --> 1:20:30.880
– No, it's not.
– Would you elaborate on that?

1:20:35.080 --> 1:20:37.720
You need to understand.

1:20:38.760 --> 1:20:42.400
When I get a report that
they won't grant air support, –

1:20:42.560 --> 1:20:47.240
– but it's the only thing
that can save me and my men, –

1:20:47.400 --> 1:20:50.760
– I see it as my duty to
get it granted.

1:20:50.920 --> 1:20:54.480
Who told you,
where the enemy was located?

1:20:54.640 --> 1:20:59.040
I don't remember. Because we were
under heavy fire!

1:21:02.640 --> 1:21:04.720
I don't remember!

1:21:04.880 --> 1:21:08.000
2-5 is on the radio
and two men in contact with the enemy.

1:21:08.160 --> 1:21:11.360
Jones and Stoffer are fighting
to save Lasse's life.

1:21:11.520 --> 1:21:15.000
Oscar is in constant contact
with the TOC at home.

1:21:15.160 --> 1:21:17.280
I do not remember who said what.

1:21:17.440 --> 1:21:20.000
But you know
who is located in Compound 6?

1:21:20.160 --> 1:21:23.000
I react to a report that
the enemy is in there.

1:21:23.160 --> 1:21:26.280
Did you also know,
that there were women and children?

1:21:37.280 --> 1:21:42.400
– No, I did not.
– Okay ... Thank you, that's all I have.

1:21:42.880 --> 1:21:46.840
Does the defence have any questions
for the defendant?

1:21:48.560 --> 1:21:51.880
Yes. I have a few questions, thank you.

1:21:53.320 --> 1:21:56.200
Claus, when you say, –

1:21:56.360 --> 1:22:00.800
– as we've heard in the clip
taken from a helmet cam:

1:22:00.960 --> 1:22:05.000
When you say, "Tell them I know,
who's in there, "–

1:22:05.160 --> 1:22:07.400
– what does that mean?

1:22:08.960 --> 1:22:14.440
Does it mean "Lie and just say, that I know,
who's in there? "

1:22:15.600 --> 1:22:20.880
Or: ÒTell them I know. Confirm that
I know who's in there?"

1:22:22.400 --> 1:22:27.320
– What does it mean, Claus?
– It means I had PID.

1:22:28.280 --> 1:22:32.040
I didn't want to waste time
discussing it. –

1:22:32.200 --> 1:22:36.200
– Not with my men on the ground,
nor the people in TOC.

1:22:36.360 --> 1:22:38.480
That's all I've got.

1:22:38.640 --> 1:22:42.720
The defendant can sit back down next to their lawyer.

1:22:52.120 --> 1:22:55.440
– Okay, so let's write that there.
– Yeah.

1:22:55.600 --> 1:22:58.520
He buys two packets of plastic figurines.

1:22:58.680 --> 1:23:02.720
The packet with the five figurines
costs a tenner, so that makes it ...

1:23:02.880 --> 1:23:04.920
– What?
– Twenty.

1:23:05.080 --> 1:23:07.360
Two times ten is twenty.

1:23:08.640 --> 1:23:10.280
48.

1:23:11.200 --> 1:23:13.240
48 + 20 + 18.

1:23:13.400 --> 1:23:16.920
... + 20 + 18.

1:23:17.960 --> 1:23:20.680
What is 24 + 18?

1:23:22.200 --> 1:23:25.400
8, 9, 10, 11, 12 ...

1:23:26.680 --> 1:23:28.520
There.

1:23:34.120 --> 1:23:35.840
42.

1:23:41.040 --> 1:23:43.360
Exactly. 42.

1:23:45.120 --> 1:23:47.560
– Are you tired?
– Nah.

1:23:52.000 --> 1:23:56.520
You know what Mom and I
are doing these days, right?

1:23:56.680 --> 1:23:59.720
– Seeing if you have to go to prison.
– Mhm.

1:24:04.960 --> 1:24:07.120
Okay, lie down.

1:24:20.760 --> 1:24:22.480
Dad?

1:24:22.640 --> 1:24:26.200
Is it true, that
you killed some children?

1:24:54.320 --> 1:24:58.960
Did you at any time observe
hostile activity from Compound 6?

1:24:59.120 --> 1:25:00.480
No.

1:25:00.640 --> 1:25:04.120
I'll make the assumption that
you, in the combat situation –

1:25:04.280 --> 1:25:08.720
– didn't direct Pedersen's
attention toward that compound.

1:25:10.680 --> 1:25:12.600
That is correct.

1:25:12.760 --> 1:25:16.640
Did you at any time observe any
enemy activity in Compound 6?

1:25:17.720 --> 1:25:19.360
No.

1:25:19.520 --> 1:25:22.800
Since you didn't observe anything,
I'll assume –

1:25:22.960 --> 1:25:27.920
– you didn't direct Pedersen's
attention toward that compound?

1:25:28.080 --> 1:25:30.520
– That is correct.
– Thank you.

1:25:32.040 --> 1:25:36.360
– I have no further questions.
– And the defence?

1:25:36.520 --> 1:25:40.920
Can you with 100 % certainty deny
that the enemy was located in Compound 6?

1:25:41.920 --> 1:25:44.440
– No, certainly not.
– Thank you.

1:25:44.600 --> 1:25:47.520
I would like to call the next witness.

1:25:52.000 --> 1:25:55.200
Najib Bisma.
Welcome.

1:25:59.280 --> 1:26:02.280
Just take a seat right there, Najib.

1:26:05.200 --> 1:26:07.360
Take a seat, please.

1:26:09.960 --> 1:26:13.200
Does a company commander
normally patrol –

1:26:13.360 --> 1:26:16.240
– as much as
Claus Michael Pedersen did?

1:26:16.400 --> 1:26:20.640
That is, put himself in the
line of fire like that?

1:26:20.800 --> 1:26:25.440
Most bosses go on
a few patrols, but ...

1:26:26.440 --> 1:26:30.320
Claus is the type that takes charge
and shows the way, –

1:26:30.480 --> 1:26:35.080
– and he did that a lot
the last month or so down there.

1:26:35.240 --> 1:26:39.800
– Did you think that was appropriate?
– There were pros and cons.

1:26:41.800 --> 1:26:45.720
You did talk about it with the defendant,
is that correct?

1:26:49.160 --> 1:26:55.160
I mentioned it to Claus,
but that was for his own sake.

1:26:55.320 --> 1:26:57.520
How so?

1:27:00.240 --> 1:27:05.440
Were you concerned about his judgment
in the time leading up to this incident?

1:27:05.600 --> 1:27:07.520
No, not worried ...

1:27:07.680 --> 1:27:11.800
According to your signed testimony –

1:27:11.960 --> 1:27:14.840
– you did have doubts about his judgment.

1:27:15.000 --> 1:27:18.880
I quote: "He had trouble
prioritizing important tasks."

1:27:19.040 --> 1:27:21.800
That is verbatim from your testimony.

1:27:21.960 --> 1:27:26.080
Claus is my friend. We started
at officer school together –

1:27:26.240 --> 1:27:29.880
– and I know his family,
so I was worried about Claus.

1:27:30.040 --> 1:27:32.760
At a personal level,
not as my boss.

1:27:32.920 --> 1:27:36.840
But he was your boss.
He was the head of a whole company.

1:27:38.120 --> 1:27:43.600
Your boss exhibits, according to you,
signs of impaired judgment.

1:27:43.760 --> 1:27:47.600
He has difficulty prioritizing tasks –

1:27:47.760 --> 1:27:52.560
– and ends up in serious combat
with several wounded.

1:27:52.720 --> 1:27:56.400
Then he orders the bombing of
a compound in the village.

1:27:56.560 --> 1:27:59.440
Did you consider, as next-in-command, –

1:27:59.600 --> 1:28:02.920
– that something went terribly
wrong out there?

1:28:09.760 --> 1:28:13.040
That is a difficult question because ...

1:28:16.320 --> 1:28:20.040
You can't imagine,
what it means to be out there.

1:28:20.200 --> 1:28:23.680
Claus is the most capable soldier
I know.

1:28:25.360 --> 1:28:30.120
And ultimately it is our responsibility
to get our men back home in one piece.

1:28:31.880 --> 1:28:34.320
That is what we are there for.

1:28:35.320 --> 1:28:38.480
But he shouldn't have been
out there with them.

1:28:38.640 --> 1:28:42.320
We should have been in the camp
with the overview.

1:28:46.480 --> 1:28:50.320
That's all for me. Thanks.

1:29:01.440 --> 1:29:03.160
Hey.

1:29:08.400 --> 1:29:11.440
I gotta do something, Maria.

1:29:13.360 --> 1:29:16.080
I gotta to do something.

1:29:28.680 --> 1:29:31.280
Hey. Come on.

1:29:32.880 --> 1:29:35.400
There there.

1:29:45.160 --> 1:29:46.640
Hey.

1:29:57.920 --> 1:30:01.040
We need you. Hey!

1:30:27.520 --> 1:30:30.640
Yes, Kenneth Jensen,
or Butcher ...

1:30:30.800 --> 1:30:34.160
That is what we have mostly heard
you referred to as.

1:30:34.320 --> 1:30:37.240
I was called Butcher, colloquially.

1:30:37.400 --> 1:30:39.760
It's a nickname.

1:30:39.920 --> 1:30:42.920
– Where does it come from?
– That's a long story.

1:30:43.080 --> 1:30:46.120
My father was a butcher.
And I have two brothers.

1:30:46.280 --> 1:30:50.320
– So we just got the nicknames Butcher.
– Butcher and Butcher.

1:30:50.480 --> 1:30:53.960
There was Little Butcher,
Medium Butcher, and Big Butcher.

1:30:54.120 --> 1:30:56.800
Okay good.

1:30:56.960 --> 1:31:01.000
In this court, we have heard
the sound from a video clip, –

1:31:01.160 --> 1:31:04.120
– in which you pass on
orders from the defendant –

1:31:04.280 --> 1:31:06.920
– to bomb Compound 6.

1:31:08.200 --> 1:31:12.240
At the time, did you know
the reason for that order?

1:31:12.400 --> 1:31:14.520
Yes, I did.

1:31:15.680 --> 1:31:18.600
It was me who told Claus, –

1:31:18.760 --> 1:31:21.920
– that I could see muzzle flashes
from Compound 6.

1:31:24.040 --> 1:31:29.400
Will the audience please refrain
from commenting?

1:31:35.400 --> 1:31:37.040
Could you repeat that?

1:31:37.200 --> 1:31:42.640
I told Claus that I saw
muzzle flashes coming from Compound 6.

1:31:45.720 --> 1:31:50.480
This is completely new to me.
How is it possible for you –

1:31:50.640 --> 1:31:54.720
– to provide that information to the defendant
from your location behind the wall?

1:31:54.880 --> 1:32:00.120
We have heard several accounts
of how chaotic it was.

1:32:00.280 --> 1:32:03.800
We have heard that you were lying in cover
with him behind the wall –

1:32:03.960 --> 1:32:06.640
– and that you were
under heavy fire.

1:32:06.800 --> 1:32:11.920
We were, but the boss gets up
to gain insight –

1:32:12.080 --> 1:32:16.840
– on the compounds from which the shots
are coming. I get up behind him.

1:32:17.000 --> 1:32:20.280
And then I see some muzzle flashes
coming from Compound 6 –

1:32:20.440 --> 1:32:23.640
– and the surrounding area,
and I inform him of this.

1:32:23.800 --> 1:32:26.840
When we're back in cover
behind the wall, –

1:32:27.000 --> 1:32:31.480
– he asks me to verify
coordinates on Compound 6.

1:32:31.640 --> 1:32:36.360
And then I can call TOC
and ask for the air support we got.

1:32:36.520 --> 1:32:40.000
On the audio sequence from
Lars Holm's helmet camera –

1:32:40.160 --> 1:32:45.280
– nothing indicates that you or the
defendant did what you are now saying.

1:32:45.440 --> 1:32:48.840
I wasn't really near Lars.
I was behind the boss.

1:32:49.000 --> 1:32:52.640
So I can't comment on what's
on that audio clip.

1:32:52.800 --> 1:32:55.120
I'm just telling you –

1:32:55.280 --> 1:32:58.680
– that it doesn't match your statement, –

1:32:58.840 --> 1:33:03.520
– but that it is very consistent
with your previous testimony.

1:33:03.680 --> 1:33:06.800
May I just point out
to the court, –

1:33:06.960 --> 1:33:10.600
– that testimony is not signed.

1:33:11.640 --> 1:33:14.400
– Is that true?
– That is correct.

1:33:14.560 --> 1:33:18.760
It is exhibit 23. There is nothing odious
about it not being signed.

1:33:18.920 --> 1:33:22.120
The witness was on his way to patrol,
when he testified.

1:33:22.280 --> 1:33:25.560
It was written
on a laptop in the camp –

1:33:25.720 --> 1:33:28.120
– and it was read through on the screen.

1:33:28.280 --> 1:33:30.720
I was just pointing it out.

1:33:30.880 --> 1:33:34.240
– It has been noted.
– But back to you, Kenneth.

1:33:34.400 --> 1:33:38.600
It was made in Afghanistan,
a few days after the incident occurred.

1:33:38.760 --> 1:33:42.320
In it you don't mention any muzzle flashes –

1:33:42.480 --> 1:33:47.720
– or any enemies around Compound 6,
none of this new information.

1:33:47.880 --> 1:33:51.720
I wasn't asked about those specifics, either.

1:33:51.880 --> 1:33:54.840
If I had been,
I would have answered.

1:33:55.000 --> 1:33:58.680
– You have to be asked specifically about that?
– Not necessarily.

1:33:58.840 --> 1:34:03.800
But I wasn't asked. We had just been
in enemy contact two-three days before.

1:34:03.960 --> 1:34:08.560
A man was critically wounded, and we were
on our way out in that same area again.

1:34:08.720 --> 1:34:12.960
Then I was questioned. And unfortunately, no.
I didn't mention anything about it.

1:34:13.120 --> 1:34:17.360
Obviously, I'm sorry about that.
But, well ... That's the way it is.

1:34:22.400 --> 1:34:25.040
Does the prosecutor have anything else?

1:34:29.480 --> 1:34:34.440
Your company commander is in difficulties
and has been indicted for half a year.

1:34:34.600 --> 1:34:37.280
The information
you're bringing forward now, –

1:34:37.440 --> 1:34:41.640
– would have been of significant importance
to both the man and his case.

1:34:41.800 --> 1:34:44.400
Do you want me to believe, –

1:34:44.560 --> 1:34:47.800
– that at no point
did it occur to you –

1:34:47.960 --> 1:34:51.080
– to share any
of this information?

1:34:51.240 --> 1:34:55.840
– It's been six months.
– Yes, it has. Sorry.

1:35:02.240 --> 1:35:06.480
– Was that it?
– Yes, that was it. Thank you.

1:35:06.640 --> 1:35:09.840
Does the defence have any questions
for the witness?

1:35:10.000 --> 1:35:13.200
No, I can't seem to think of
anything right now.

1:35:13.360 --> 1:35:16.120
Then you are done.

1:35:16.280 --> 1:35:20.760
You may leave or sit with audience,
if you so please.

1:35:27.000 --> 1:35:28.720
The law is clear:

1:35:28.880 --> 1:35:32.800
The prohibition against arbitrary attacks
is of central importance –

1:35:32.960 --> 1:35:37.000
– in the protection of
the civilian population.

1:35:37.160 --> 1:35:40.600
At no point has the defendant
been able to justify –

1:35:40.760 --> 1:35:43.400
– why he decided
to attack.

1:35:43.560 --> 1:35:47.600
He says someone in the unit identified
Compound 6 as a hostile target, –

1:35:47.760 --> 1:35:52.160
– but he hasn't indicated who or
specified further circumstances.

1:35:52.320 --> 1:35:56.640
The court has heard me question every single
soldier in the vicinity of the defendant, –

1:35:56.800 --> 1:36:00.520
– who would have been
able to identify Compound 6.

1:36:00.680 --> 1:36:06.920
And one soldier, Kenneth 'Butcher' Jensen,
waited until court to inform us –

1:36:07.080 --> 1:36:11.840
– that he observed the muzzle flashes
and conveyed it to the defendant.

1:36:12.000 --> 1:36:14.640
I have no trust in
the witness, –

1:36:14.800 --> 1:36:17.400
– because in the sound recording –

1:36:17.560 --> 1:36:21.640
– we can clearly hear the exchange of words
between the defendant and Butcher –

1:36:21.800 --> 1:36:27.000
– up until the order: "I don't
give a shit who's in there."

1:36:27.160 --> 1:36:30.160
And when next-in-command
in TOC insists on PID:

1:36:30.320 --> 1:36:33.120
"Tell them, I know
who's in there."

1:36:33.280 --> 1:36:37.880
I see a man who disregards
the need of a civilian population –

1:36:38.040 --> 1:36:40.800
– to save his
own guy, Lasse.

1:36:40.960 --> 1:36:44.000
Is that understandable from a human perspective?

1:36:44.160 --> 1:36:45.800
Yes.

1:36:45.960 --> 1:36:51.360
We can probably all understand
the difficult dilemma.

1:36:51.520 --> 1:36:54.320
But although we have
sympathy for the defendant, –

1:36:54.480 --> 1:36:57.720
– who appears to be
a competent soldier and leader –

1:36:57.880 --> 1:37:00.840
– and although we must provide
Danish soldiers room for manoeuvreability –

1:37:01.000 --> 1:37:04.560
– in extreme circumstances,
no one is above the law.

1:37:04.720 --> 1:37:07.480
Otherwise, a judicial system is rendered superfluous.

1:37:07.640 --> 1:37:10.960
If we in a case like this –

1:37:11.120 --> 1:37:15.360
– let such a serious violation
of humanitarian rights slide, –

1:37:15.520 --> 1:37:19.240
– we will end somewhere,
where we do not want to be.

1:37:19.400 --> 1:37:24.200
Claus Michael Pedersen must be sentenced
because there is no doubt –

1:37:24.360 --> 1:37:29.280
– that he intentionally disregarded
the elementary rules of engagement.

1:37:31.120 --> 1:37:34.240
Basically, the penalty in ¤ 36.2 –

1:37:34.400 --> 1:37:37.040
– is prison for life.

1:37:37.200 --> 1:37:40.480
Now, however,
this is a jury trial, –

1:37:40.640 --> 1:37:44.280
– because the defendant did not have
the intention to kill civilians.

1:37:44.440 --> 1:37:49.480
But their deaths are a direct
consequence of his decision.

1:37:51.520 --> 1:37:55.000
The maximum penalty is four years.

1:37:55.160 --> 1:37:59.640
It is my contention, that we
are close to that maximum.

1:37:59.800 --> 1:38:04.000
With these remarks, I rest my case.

1:38:04.160 --> 1:38:08.560
I would like to remind the court,
that it is the prosecutor –

1:38:08.720 --> 1:38:11.400
– who has the burden of proof –

1:38:11.560 --> 1:38:15.280
– and must prove beyond any
reasonable doubt –

1:38:15.440 --> 1:38:18.000
– that my client is guilty.

1:38:18.160 --> 1:38:22.960
The point of contention was quite
simply, if my client had PID.

1:38:24.240 --> 1:38:28.400
My client says loud and clear,
that he did.

1:38:28.560 --> 1:38:32.920
The prosecutor claims that he did not.

1:38:33.080 --> 1:38:38.360
But then we hear communications officer
Kenneth Jensen, Butcher, tell us –

1:38:38.520 --> 1:38:42.080
– it was he, who saw the
muzzle fire coming from Compound 6.

1:38:42.240 --> 1:38:47.160
That it was he who identified
Compound 6 as a military target –

1:38:48.080 --> 1:38:51.760
– and not as a civilian target,
as the prosecutor claims.

1:38:54.000 --> 1:38:57.880
My client, Claus Michael Pedersen,
had PID.

1:38:58.800 --> 1:39:03.040
If Danish soldiers, who put
their lives one the line, are prosecuted –

1:39:03.200 --> 1:39:08.400
– for violations of the military
criminal code, on conjecture, –

1:39:08.560 --> 1:39:11.640
– THEN we'll be somewhere,
we do not want to be.

1:39:11.800 --> 1:39:16.920
Therefore, I must call
for acquittal on all charges.

1:39:17.080 --> 1:39:21.000
And with that, I rest my case. Thank you.

1:39:21.160 --> 1:39:25.560
Now it's your turn, Claus Michael
Pedersen, you have the last word.

1:39:25.720 --> 1:39:30.040
Do you have anything to add,
that has not already been said?

1:39:32.000 --> 1:39:33.720
No.

1:39:33.880 --> 1:39:37.080
Then we will retire
and deliberate on the case.

1:39:37.240 --> 1:39:41.160
The verdict will be handed down
on Thursday the 14th

1:39:41.880 --> 1:39:44.240
Let me go in front.

1:39:59.200 --> 1:40:01.240
This one's good!

1:40:01.400 --> 1:40:03.880
– Here! Throw it.
– This one's good.

1:40:05.760 --> 1:40:07.240
Two!

1:40:14.120 --> 1:40:15.920
– Dad?
– Yes.

1:40:16.080 --> 1:40:19.960
– Look at this rock.
– Did you found an nice rock?

1:40:20.120 --> 1:40:23.880
– No. ...'s got a hole in it.
– What?

1:40:27.240 --> 1:40:31.320
– Hold it like this.
– Show him a rock skip.

1:40:32.760 --> 1:40:35.080
– Hello!
– Can you see me?

1:40:35.240 --> 1:40:38.600
– How many fingers am I holding up?
– Two.

1:40:42.720 --> 1:40:45.400
– Okay, are you ready?
– No!!

1:40:45.560 --> 1:40:48.320
– What?
– What a weak shot.

1:40:48.480 --> 1:40:51.080
Yeah, it was a silly shot.

1:41:44.920 --> 1:41:47.280
We will now pronounce the verdict.

1:41:47.440 --> 1:41:50.800
Claus Michael Pedersen is acquitted.

1:41:50.960 --> 1:41:53.920
The Treasury will pay the costs of the trial.

1:41:58.160 --> 1:42:01.560
Can I ... Can I ...
Can I please have order in the court?

1:42:01.720 --> 1:42:06.480
A reaction is understandable,
but please, refrain from it.

1:42:06.640 --> 1:42:11.560
Please sit down, and I will provide
the reasoning for the verdict.

1:42:15.080 --> 1:42:17.960
The verdict is unanimous, –

1:42:18.120 --> 1:42:22.600
– and that means
that we all three agree with the result.

1:43:41.600 --> 1:43:44.640
– This is Afghanistan, right?
– Mhm.

1:43:44.800 --> 1:43:48.040
– And that is Denmark, right?
– Mhm.

1:43:48.800 --> 1:43:52.320
And this is Madagascar,
that is South Africa –

1:43:52.480 --> 1:43:56.760
– and this is Brazil,
and this is Italy.

1:43:58.240 --> 1:44:01.160
Or I mean ...
What was it?

1:44:01.320 --> 1:44:03.760
– USA.
– USA.

1:44:03.920 --> 1:44:07.680
– Come.
– USA. USA.

1:44:07.840 --> 1:44:12.000
– Now go to bed. USA.
– Dad?

1:44:15.640 --> 1:44:21.080
– Do you have to go away again?
– No. I don't.

1:44:22.800 --> 1:44:25.920
– So you'll stay at home now?
– Yes.

1:44:28.400 --> 1:44:31.120
Could you tuck me in tomorrow then?

1:44:33.200 --> 1:44:35.120
Could you?

1:44:36.960 --> 1:44:39.360
I sure can.

1:44:39.520 --> 1:44:43.520
– I love you.
– I love you too. Good night.

1:46:03.020 --> 1:46:08.520
