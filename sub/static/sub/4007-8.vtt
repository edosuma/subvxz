00:10.440 --> 00:12.079
<i>Previously on</i> Dexter:

00:12.280 --> 00:14.431
Remember me?
What are you doing here?

00:14.600 --> 00:17.160
You should leave
before my husband returns.

00:17.320 --> 00:18.754
Your husband?
Oh, God.

00:18.920 --> 00:21.071
You're still in love with her?
No.

00:21.240 --> 00:23.596
We have got to get her
out of our lives.

00:23.760 --> 00:25.274
What is it you'd like to do?

00:25.440 --> 00:29.036
I would like to take her to Marshal
Services and have her arrested.

00:29.200 --> 00:33.558
When the Brain Surgeon was out there,
I trusted Dexter to solve the problem.

00:33.760 --> 00:35.672
Before you take matters
into your hands,

00:35.840 --> 00:38.435
be sure to consider
all the consequences.

00:38.640 --> 00:41.200
Can I borrow that
high-tech GPS tracker?

00:44.120 --> 00:46.237
Zach Hamilton killed Norma Rivera.

00:46.440 --> 00:49.512
What if you were to teach Zach
the code?

00:50.120 --> 00:52.715
Am I ready to be a spiritual father?

00:53.520 --> 00:55.113
Are you gonna help me be like you?

00:56.800 --> 00:59.634
Hi, Dexter!
Going for a little night swim.

00:59.800 --> 01:02.235
Enjoy.
What the fuck were you thinking?

01:02.400 --> 01:05.358
That asshole is walking around free.
We have nothing.

01:05.519 --> 01:08.354
That's why I was following him.
Let it go. That's an order.

01:08.520 --> 01:10.671
By the way, me and Jamie
are moving in together.

01:10.880 --> 01:12.872
What?
Why did you marry him?

01:13.040 --> 01:14.793
He was there when you weren't.

01:14.960 --> 01:17.270
No, Miles, stop.
You'll never leave this boat.

01:20.960 --> 01:24.397
I told the crew that Miles was
going to New York for a few days.

01:24.600 --> 01:26.910
Please don't leave town
before we talk again.

01:27.600 --> 01:29.193
I won't.

01:33.040 --> 01:37.000
Come on, what the fuck? Dexter!
It looks like he's not home.

01:39.080 --> 01:40.833
Cassie.

01:41.200 --> 01:43.874
Norma Rivera was bludgeoned.

01:44.120 --> 01:46.715
Is it possible Zach did this?

03:49.600 --> 03:51.990
<i>Every contact leaves a trace.</i>

03:52.960 --> 03:56.715
<i>That idea is the foundation
of all crime scene analysis.</i>

04:00.400 --> 04:04.440
<i>I should be focused
on who bludgeoned Cassie and why.</i>

04:05.880 --> 04:07.633
<i>But instead,</i>

04:10.720 --> 04:13.030
<i>ever since Hannah
came back into my orbit,</i>

04:13.200 --> 04:15.192
<i>she's all I can think about.</i>

04:24.840 --> 04:26.672
Manner of death?

04:28.840 --> 04:30.274
Swan.

04:31.440 --> 04:34.433
Killer didn't plan this.
It was impulsive.

04:34.600 --> 04:37.320
<i>This is just how Zach Hamilton
killed Norma Rivera.</i>

04:37.480 --> 04:40.120
She was killed pretty deep
in her apartment.

04:40.280 --> 04:42.351
Like she let the killer in herself.

04:42.520 --> 04:44.273
So she knew him.

04:44.440 --> 04:46.557
That guy she was dating.

04:46.760 --> 04:49.832
You said you were coming here
to pick Cassie up for a date.

04:50.000 --> 04:54.153
Yes, I was late.
Where were you coming from?

04:54.320 --> 04:57.791
I had a-- The building inspection.

04:57.960 --> 05:00.156
I'm a structural engineer.

05:00.360 --> 05:04.149
Well, maybe I was wrong. Maybe it was
the repairman or the delivery guy.

05:04.360 --> 05:05.760
<i>Or Zach Hamilton.</i>

05:05.920 --> 05:08.435
<i>If I'd paid more attention to Zach
instead of being with Hannah,</i>

05:10.560 --> 05:13.200
<i>would Cassie still be alive?</i>

05:21.520 --> 05:23.239
<i>Is that Zach's blood?</i>

05:25.440 --> 05:29.992
<i>Zach knew Cassie.
He met her once, here with me.</i>

05:31.360 --> 05:32.794
Cassie was a good person.

05:32.960 --> 05:36.032
You sure there was no one else
she was having issues with?

05:36.200 --> 05:38.396
I can't think right now.
Will you please--?

05:38.560 --> 05:40.358
It's okay, it's okay.

05:44.520 --> 05:46.432
Hey, Deb. How are you?

05:46.600 --> 05:48.353
I'm okay.
It's good to see you

05:48.520 --> 05:49.510
at a crime scene.

05:49.680 --> 05:51.239
Heh. I'm gonna talk to Dex.

05:51.400 --> 05:52.834
Go ahead.

05:57.560 --> 05:59.631
Harrison's asleep.

06:00.240 --> 06:01.356
Thanks.

06:04.800 --> 06:06.359
That's a break.

06:06.880 --> 06:10.351
Could that be the killer's blood?
Here's hoping.

06:11.520 --> 06:13.352
Are you okay?

06:16.040 --> 06:17.713
Sure.

06:17.880 --> 06:20.440
Why the fuck do I even ask?

06:20.760 --> 06:22.035
What about Hannah?

06:23.120 --> 06:25.589
What about her?
Is she still here?

06:25.760 --> 06:26.876
Hey, Deb.

06:27.040 --> 06:28.918
Hey.

06:29.080 --> 06:32.278
Who would want to kill Cassie?
She owe people money?

06:32.440 --> 06:35.877
We're looking into that.
What about customers or a vendor?

06:37.040 --> 06:40.477
Sorry.
I have no fucking business being here.

06:40.640 --> 06:42.916
Any time you wanna come back,
the door's always open.

06:43.680 --> 06:46.514
Maybe I'll put an application
in the mail.

06:47.680 --> 06:50.240
I'll come back to finish
this conversation, yeah?

06:50.840 --> 06:52.240
Okay.

06:53.400 --> 06:54.880
<i>Can't wait.</i>

06:59.120 --> 07:02.511
<i>I would give everything
to feel nothing again.</i>

07:17.520 --> 07:19.989
We need to get you out of town
as soon as possible.

07:20.480 --> 07:23.200
I need a new passport.
I have a guy that can do that.

07:23.360 --> 07:27.115
I'll find out what he needs.
That's just a phone call.

07:27.520 --> 07:32.595
You could have phoned me, rather
than driving all the way down here.

07:33.200 --> 07:35.431
This was on the way to the lab.

07:36.040 --> 07:39.636
This marina is not
on the way to the lab.

07:42.560 --> 07:44.313
You know, we, um...

07:44.880 --> 07:48.191
We missed a spot of blood
cleaning up.

07:48.640 --> 07:50.757
No, we didn't.
Edge of the whisky bottle.

07:50.920 --> 07:53.037
I noticed it this morning.

07:56.160 --> 08:00.439
I was so glad to see it
because it reminded me of you.

08:03.160 --> 08:05.197
Did you clean it up?

08:05.360 --> 08:06.919
Yes, I cleaned it up.

08:07.360 --> 08:09.829
With bleach?
Yes.

08:13.160 --> 08:15.755
Miami is not the place
for you to be right now.

08:17.120 --> 08:19.476
The sooner we get you out of here,
the better.

08:21.080 --> 08:23.276
I completely agree.

08:40.200 --> 08:42.999
<i>It is Zach's blood
under Cassie's nails.</i>

08:43.159 --> 08:45.720
<i>He killed another innocent woman.</i>

08:46.120 --> 08:49.238
<i>What a waste.
He could have had a great future.</i>

08:50.440 --> 08:54.195
<i>Miami Metro can never know.
It's one small step from Zach to me.</i>

08:54.360 --> 08:55.680
Hey, Dex.

08:55.840 --> 08:58.878
Remember Niki, the apple
that didn't fall too far from my tree?

08:59.040 --> 09:00.440
Hi.
Hi.

09:00.640 --> 09:04.077
Around here we call Dexter
"the king of spatter."

09:04.240 --> 09:07.597
We do?
I do, in private.

09:08.640 --> 09:12.316
Hey, feel free to send
any and all paperwork her way.

09:14.000 --> 09:15.514
Here you go.
Oh, uh,

09:15.680 --> 09:17.990
the blood under Cassie's nails?

09:18.200 --> 09:19.793
No luck. It was hers.

09:19.960 --> 09:23.431
From a transfer
after her head started to bleed.

09:23.600 --> 09:26.991
"The victim collapsed
into a pool of her own blood."

09:27.160 --> 09:29.550
Hey, are you--?
Are you okay with all this?

09:29.720 --> 09:33.760
I mean, I am a little bit worried
about the energy around here.

09:33.920 --> 09:36.719
Well, then maybe we can hang
a crystal in the corner.

09:37.080 --> 09:40.676
Yeah, we should sage the place first.

09:42.320 --> 09:43.913
Could I talk to you for a sec?

09:44.080 --> 09:45.992
Actually, I'm--
Real quick.

09:46.760 --> 09:48.638
You recognise these?

09:49.200 --> 09:51.715
Yeah, I took them.
Yeah, now look at these.

09:51.880 --> 09:54.156
Norma Rivera, Cassie Jollenston.

09:54.360 --> 09:56.397
Are they fucking similar, or what?

09:57.520 --> 10:01.355
They were both bludgeoned. Bludgeonings
can look pretty fucking similar.

10:01.920 --> 10:04.480
Do you think Zach Hamilton
could have done this?

10:05.360 --> 10:08.432
Zach knew Norma. How could
he have possibly known Cassie?

10:08.600 --> 10:12.389
I know, it's crazy, I--
What's crazy is Batista and Matthews

10:12.560 --> 10:15.314
wanted you to lay off
looking into this Hamilton kid.

10:15.880 --> 10:18.759
This Hamilton kid is a fucking monster.
You know it too.

10:18.920 --> 10:22.391
Not really. I think you should drop this.
Think about your career.

10:22.600 --> 10:25.399
It's not like I'm gonna make sergeant.
Do me a favour.

10:25.600 --> 10:28.195
You see any of Zach's DNA
at the crime scene, just let me know.

10:29.120 --> 10:30.998
Absolutely.

10:32.760 --> 10:34.956
He hasn't returned my calls.

10:36.000 --> 10:41.519
I tried to reach him too. I spoke to
his parents, they haven't seen him.

10:41.680 --> 10:44.912
He could be on the run,
hiding out somewhere.

10:45.120 --> 10:47.555
Were you with that Hannah person?

10:48.640 --> 10:50.632
Is that why this woman is dead?

10:51.520 --> 10:55.514
She's dead because you talked me out
of killing Zach in the first place.

10:56.080 --> 11:00.233
He showed real potential.
You saw that.

11:01.800 --> 11:03.792
I thought you were having
an impact on him.

11:04.800 --> 11:09.716
Zach spoke to me of trying to live up
to your rules, your standards.

11:11.800 --> 11:14.235
I thought he was processing it all.

11:14.440 --> 11:16.716
Yeah, Zach's smart,
but he can't control himself.

11:16.880 --> 11:18.553
We both should have seen that.

11:18.720 --> 11:20.871
Zach's just a boy.

11:23.000 --> 11:25.231
A boy who knows
too much about me,

11:25.600 --> 11:29.276
about you,
who's killed two innocent women.

11:31.720 --> 11:34.679
No, I guess you don't have
many options, do you?

11:34.880 --> 11:36.314
No.

11:38.600 --> 11:44.710
I wonder if it will be different for you,
because of what could have been.

11:45.240 --> 11:48.551
I doubt it.
But surely there have been

11:49.640 --> 11:52.758
people that were
more difficult for you to--

11:52.920 --> 11:56.357
How do you like to say it?
Take care of.

11:56.520 --> 11:59.354
Zach Hamilton is not one of them.

12:02.040 --> 12:04.430
I'm not sure I believe you.

12:13.400 --> 12:15.551
<i>Zach rented a room in Fiesta Key.</i>

12:15.720 --> 12:18.519
<i>He's on the run,
and using his own credit card.</i>

12:18.680 --> 12:21.149
<i>Rookie mistake.</i>

12:27.240 --> 12:30.711
<i>I forget the impact murder has
on real people.</i>

12:37.600 --> 12:39.000
Deb.

12:41.080 --> 12:44.869
Ahem. Any luck?
With what?

12:45.920 --> 12:48.833
Cassie's case?
Is that why you're here?

12:49.000 --> 12:50.434
No.

12:51.920 --> 12:54.754
Hey, Jamie.
How are you doing?

12:54.960 --> 12:57.600
I don't know how you two
do this every day.

12:57.760 --> 12:59.319
I don't.

12:59.880 --> 13:01.314
Right.

13:10.680 --> 13:16.153
On a scale of one to 10,
10 being out of our lives forever,

13:16.520 --> 13:19.035
where the fuck is Hannah?
She's not a threat.

13:19.200 --> 13:21.795
Last time we talked,
you said, "I'm on top of it."

13:21.960 --> 13:25.237
And I am.
Are you on top of it, or on top of her?

13:25.400 --> 13:27.198
Deb--
Is she in Miami?

13:29.880 --> 13:33.476
What the fuck is she doing here?
It has to do with her husband.

13:33.640 --> 13:37.350
The casino guy?
He's abusive, verbally and physically.

13:37.920 --> 13:39.877
They seem perfect.

13:40.040 --> 13:44.114
What about him?
She wanted me to--

13:44.800 --> 13:48.510
Why didn't she do it herself?
Too much scrutiny.

13:50.480 --> 13:52.233
Did you do it?

13:53.200 --> 13:54.634
No.

13:54.800 --> 13:57.156
Well, that must have pissed her off.

13:58.080 --> 14:00.231
What's to keep her
from trying to kill us again?

14:00.440 --> 14:03.319
She didn't try to kill us.
She wanted my attention.

14:03.480 --> 14:06.837
By poisoning me and leaving you
on the side of the fucking road?

14:09.240 --> 14:11.755
You have the fucking altitude
to see all of this,

14:11.920 --> 14:15.277
that she's using you,
and you still want to protect her?

14:17.720 --> 14:20.633
Once she gets her passport,
she'll be out of our lives forever.

14:23.360 --> 14:24.794
You believe that?
I do.

14:24.960 --> 14:28.795
Well, that's the thing that you can't
see, that you're lying to yourself.

14:29.520 --> 14:31.512
She's a murderer.

14:31.920 --> 14:34.151
She needs to be locked up.
She could talk.

14:34.320 --> 14:37.597
After LaGuerta, I can't afford
another round of questions.

14:38.200 --> 14:43.229
She's a fugitive. She's a poisoner.
She's easily discredited.

14:44.760 --> 14:46.319
Enough already.

14:59.320 --> 15:04.076
We were supposed to have lunch
together, Cassie and me.

15:04.440 --> 15:06.397
Jamie, I'm sorry.

15:07.240 --> 15:09.709
I can't be here right now.

15:10.360 --> 15:13.000
I can take Harrison with me.

15:13.160 --> 15:14.913
I moved in with Joey.

15:16.280 --> 15:19.000
Oh.
I thought we'd go there,

15:19.160 --> 15:21.595
since you're on the next few days.

15:21.760 --> 15:23.479
I mean, if that's okay with you.

15:23.640 --> 15:25.757
Yeah, that's okay with me.

15:33.920 --> 15:35.718
Don't smile?

15:41.080 --> 15:44.357
Just send this
to the passport guy.

15:45.040 --> 15:47.680
He'll have a new identity

15:47.880 --> 15:50.952
and all the paperwork for you
by tomorrow.

15:51.120 --> 15:53.396
Do I get to pick my name?

15:53.840 --> 15:56.071
I doubt it, but I'll ask.

15:56.320 --> 15:59.040
So does he drop it off, or--?

15:59.200 --> 16:04.878
No, I will.
Okay, so just wait here?

16:06.200 --> 16:08.760
Maybe you should come with me.
Where?

16:08.920 --> 16:12.596
I have to go to the Keys tonight.
The Keys?

16:13.320 --> 16:15.039
It would just be for the night.

16:19.320 --> 16:21.073
Besides, it's not safe for you
to be here.

16:21.760 --> 16:24.514
Safe?
You know, alone.

16:24.680 --> 16:29.311
I sent the crew away for a few hours
because I knew that you were coming.

16:29.480 --> 16:31.995
They can protect me
from almost anything.

16:32.160 --> 16:34.720
It's the "almost" that concerns me.

16:37.240 --> 16:39.232
So, what's in the Keys,

16:39.400 --> 16:41.551
or should I say who is in the Keys?

16:41.720 --> 16:43.871
I'll tell you on the way down.

16:46.960 --> 16:49.600
How would you like to make
a boatload of cash?

16:49.760 --> 16:51.911
I'm assuming that's
a rhetorical question.

16:52.080 --> 16:54.311
U.S. Marshal Service
is offering $25,000

16:54.480 --> 16:57.314
for information leading
to the arrest of Hannah McKay.

16:57.480 --> 17:00.075
Sal Price's publisher is
offering another 125,000,

17:00.240 --> 17:02.800
his family, another hundred.
Put that together--

17:03.000 --> 17:07.392
Two-fifty. Yeah, I can do math.
I think Hannah McKay is back in Miami.

17:08.040 --> 17:11.875
And you think this because...?
Are you interested or not?

17:12.839 --> 17:14.398
Very.

17:19.480 --> 17:23.234
No fucking way. They're gone.

17:23.400 --> 17:25.198
You sure this is the Castner slip?

17:25.359 --> 17:27.875
I'm sure.
You sure McKay was under the alias

17:28.040 --> 17:30.680
of "Maggie Castner"?
Yes.

17:31.680 --> 17:33.558
What, you don't believe me?

17:34.480 --> 17:37.951
Lot of pretty blond girls in Miami.
You sure Hannah McKay was here?

17:38.160 --> 17:41.676
I know for a fucking fact that she was.
How?

17:42.560 --> 17:43.789
I just do.

17:45.520 --> 17:49.799
You really don't like her, do you?
Nope.

17:50.000 --> 17:52.993
I'm just saying, emotions cloud
your judgement, you know?

17:53.160 --> 17:55.994
You keep it about the money,
someday you may have a yacht.

17:56.160 --> 17:58.516
I don't want a fucking yacht.
Well, I do.

17:58.720 --> 18:01.440
So let's keep it
about my money, all right?

18:02.600 --> 18:06.116
So the yacht may be gone,
but we don't know if they were on it.

18:07.800 --> 18:10.269
Maybe the dock master
knows something. I'll see.

18:10.480 --> 18:12.233
I'll meet you back at the office,
all right?

18:16.040 --> 18:20.080
Joey, I don't want to be here alone.

18:20.760 --> 18:22.433
You're not alone, you got the kid.

18:23.280 --> 18:25.590
My name is Harrison.

18:25.760 --> 18:29.674
And a fine name that is.
Don't you got some cartoons to watch?

18:30.720 --> 18:35.192
Joey, I am freaking out.
My friend was murdered.

18:35.560 --> 18:39.600
I-- Look, I know,
but once I catch the killer,

18:39.800 --> 18:42.190
you're not gonna have
to be scared anymore, okay?

18:43.680 --> 18:47.230
You know, if it were Deb asking you to
stay, you wouldn't even put up a fight.

18:48.480 --> 18:50.312
Deb wouldn't ask me to stay.

18:50.520 --> 18:52.876
She'd want to catch the killer
as bad as I do.

18:53.040 --> 18:55.077
Sorry I'm not Deb.

18:58.120 --> 19:00.191
Hey, hey, hey, come here.

19:00.360 --> 19:03.558
You need me to stay here,
I'll stay here, okay?

19:17.800 --> 19:20.360
Motherfuck it.

19:24.360 --> 19:25.794
Hey, Deb, what's up?

19:25.960 --> 19:29.158
<i>Hey, just checking in about Hannah.</i>

19:29.320 --> 19:31.596
I haven't seen her.

19:31.760 --> 19:34.480
<i>Where are you?</i>
Grabbing some dinner.

19:34.640 --> 19:36.836
Oh, yeah? Want company?

19:37.480 --> 19:39.119
No, I'm good.
<i>No, seriously.</i>

19:39.320 --> 19:42.313
I'll join you. Where are you?
<i>Um...</i>

19:43.760 --> 19:45.160
Look at a fucking street sign.

19:46.360 --> 19:48.829
I'm on the highway.
How about tomorrow?

19:50.720 --> 19:52.200
Sure.

19:55.360 --> 19:57.352
Dick for brains.

19:59.520 --> 20:02.160
She's a ray of sunshine, isn't she?

20:08.600 --> 20:10.717
So, what'd you say to the crew?

20:10.880 --> 20:13.111
I told them
to head on to St. Kitts.

20:13.520 --> 20:16.433
It was our next stop
after Miami anyway.

20:17.000 --> 20:20.880
They're paid not to ask questions.
Hm.

20:23.480 --> 20:24.914
So who are you after?

20:25.760 --> 20:27.797
His name is Zach.

20:28.160 --> 20:30.072
What did Zach do?

20:30.640 --> 20:32.757
Disappoint me.

20:33.400 --> 20:36.632
He was someone
Dr. Vogel thought I could, uh,

20:36.800 --> 20:37.995
mentor.

20:38.160 --> 20:40.038
Who's Dr. Vogel?

20:40.200 --> 20:43.716
Dr. Evelyn Vogel.
She studies psychopaths.

20:44.280 --> 20:47.796
My father went to see her about me.

20:47.960 --> 20:50.839
Heh. How did that conversation go?

20:51.000 --> 20:53.879
"Hey, I've got this son
who has these urges."

20:54.040 --> 20:55.997
He was at the end of his rope.

20:58.040 --> 21:01.670
Dr. Vogel's the one who came up
with the idea of the code.

21:01.840 --> 21:03.354
She...

21:04.280 --> 21:05.430
created me.

21:08.200 --> 21:10.635
Wow.
I know.

21:11.240 --> 21:13.630
So how does it feel
to finally meet her,

21:13.800 --> 21:15.996
to find out that she even existed?

21:16.160 --> 21:18.550
Like finding a family member.

21:24.000 --> 21:26.071
Well, she must be very proud of you.

21:29.960 --> 21:33.954
Are there others of you out there?
Just Zach, as far as I know.

21:34.120 --> 21:35.839
She thought he...

21:37.280 --> 21:39.431
She saw a little of me in him,

21:39.600 --> 21:41.557
or who I used to be.

21:41.720 --> 21:43.518
Focused.

21:43.920 --> 21:45.434
Driven.

21:46.520 --> 21:50.275
There's one big difference though.
He'd already killed an innocent woman

21:50.440 --> 21:54.195
when I met him,
and now he's killed another.

21:55.240 --> 21:57.118
So he's a terrible student.

21:58.600 --> 22:01.559
I wasn't exactly a hands-on teacher.

22:04.280 --> 22:05.953
He's fled to the Keys.

22:06.120 --> 22:09.113
I can't have him
out there in the world.

22:09.280 --> 22:11.840
He's a problem
you have to solve.

22:17.280 --> 22:21.240
I was a problem you had to solve too,
and I escaped.

22:23.680 --> 22:26.593
How come you never tried to find me?

22:27.600 --> 22:29.319
And do what?

22:30.360 --> 22:32.556
Solve the problem.

22:36.600 --> 22:38.956
I liked knowing you were out there.

22:49.400 --> 22:50.834
Elway, it's me.

22:51.000 --> 22:52.878
<i>Hey, I was just about to call you.</i>

22:53.040 --> 22:54.838
<i>Dockmaster ends up
being a gabby fuck.</i>

22:55.000 --> 22:57.469
He heard Mr. Castner
flew yesterday to New York

22:57.640 --> 23:01.475
sans Mrs. Castner, who just sent
the yacht to St. Kitts earlier today.

23:01.640 --> 23:04.951
Where she is now is anybody's guess.
I'll venture one, the Keys.

23:05.120 --> 23:07.954
<i>Is this something you just know,
or you have a source?</i>

23:08.120 --> 23:10.476
I'm on my way down there now
to check it out.

23:10.640 --> 23:12.791
You know about her husband
being with her?

23:12.960 --> 23:14.599
<i>You said Castner was in New York.</i>

23:14.760 --> 23:17.480
I checked the airport, the Gulfstream
never left the tarmac, so...

23:20.320 --> 23:23.154
I wonder if she killed him.
<i>Heh-heh-heh. There's a leap.</i>

23:23.320 --> 23:24.834
That's what she fucking does.

23:25.000 --> 23:27.469
She murders people
and she gets away with it.

23:27.640 --> 23:29.950
I cannot wait to fucking find her.

23:30.120 --> 23:32.794
Remember what I said.
No crusaders on the payroll.

23:32.960 --> 23:36.670
<i>Let's find her, let's bring her in,
let's get paid, okay? Thank you.</i>

23:45.800 --> 23:47.234
Shrimp?

23:48.080 --> 23:49.594
Yeah.

23:50.280 --> 23:52.078
Bottom feeders.

23:52.960 --> 23:54.360
Uh-huh.

23:56.440 --> 23:59.194
They eat all the garbage
at the bottom of the ocean.

24:00.080 --> 24:02.800
They take out the trash.
Mm.

24:03.240 --> 24:06.278
Is that what you do?
You take out the trash?

24:07.720 --> 24:09.951
Thought might have crossed my mind.

24:14.400 --> 24:17.677
You have all these clever sayings
inside your head, don't you?

24:17.840 --> 24:20.912
About what you do and who you are.

24:21.080 --> 24:25.154
Yeah, I think a lot.
Mm. I'm sure you do.

24:28.000 --> 24:31.835
So, what brilliant turn of phrase
have you come up with to describe me?

24:33.320 --> 24:35.437
The evil temptress?

24:36.520 --> 24:37.920
Passionate poisoner?

24:38.120 --> 24:39.554
Heh.

24:40.800 --> 24:42.712
Fiendish florist.

24:49.920 --> 24:53.800
Really, when you're lying in bed at night
and I happen to cross your mind,

24:53.960 --> 24:55.679
what do you call me?

24:59.320 --> 25:00.913
Hannah.

25:03.360 --> 25:05.158
You're just Hannah.

25:14.120 --> 25:16.316
You're such a flirt.

25:16.480 --> 25:20.838
No, I'm not. I'm just being honest.
Please, you're the master manipulator.

25:21.040 --> 25:23.555
I am?
Yes, you are.

25:23.720 --> 25:29.034
Is that what you call me?
No, I have a million names for you.

25:29.200 --> 25:31.590
Really? I'd love to hear them.

25:40.640 --> 25:41.869
What can I get you guys?

26:11.560 --> 26:13.870
Are you sure this is the place?

26:23.200 --> 26:25.237
Just wait in the car.

26:48.960 --> 26:50.952
<i>What is all this?</i>

27:13.200 --> 27:15.237
A for effort, huh?

27:15.680 --> 27:17.990
He made a lot of mistakes.

27:18.720 --> 27:21.235
But for a first try, it's not bad.

27:21.520 --> 27:24.797
It's not bad. No.

27:26.760 --> 27:28.911
It's not great either.

27:30.280 --> 27:32.351
Better than your first try.

27:33.960 --> 27:35.758
Do you have to do this?

27:36.840 --> 27:38.638
Yes, I do.

27:42.000 --> 27:44.993
And when I find him,
I'll use this room.

27:51.200 --> 27:54.557
Detective Quinn.
Hey, how are you holding up?

27:55.520 --> 27:57.796
I haven't slept much, to be honest.

27:59.840 --> 28:01.513
We, uh,

28:02.000 --> 28:05.232
talked about a life together,
Cassie and I.

28:05.400 --> 28:08.359
I know it's fast, but--
No, no, no.

28:08.520 --> 28:11.638
I move fast too. Too fast.

28:12.480 --> 28:15.598
Well, when it's right...

28:16.920 --> 28:18.673
You're going through a tough time.

28:18.880 --> 28:22.351
I was wondering if you could
take a look at a photo for me.

28:23.200 --> 28:25.510
Have you seen that kid
around Cassie?

28:25.720 --> 28:27.279
Maybe at her food truck?

28:28.000 --> 28:29.753
Is this who you think killed her?

28:31.520 --> 28:33.113
Just a person of interest.

28:35.200 --> 28:37.032
I don't know him.

28:38.000 --> 28:40.117
He looks familiar, but...

28:40.400 --> 28:41.914
I'm sorry.

28:55.800 --> 28:57.712
What on earth
is your daughter doing?

28:58.200 --> 29:01.238
She's just clearing
the bad murder juju out of the lab.

29:02.000 --> 29:06.517
Does she realise this is a department
founded in bad murder juju?

29:08.440 --> 29:10.909
Where are we on this
Cassie Jollenston murder?

29:11.080 --> 29:13.675
Been working on the customers
from her food truck,

29:13.840 --> 29:18.517
but most of them paid in cash, so...
So they're hard to track down.

29:18.680 --> 29:22.390
Any other leads?
None worth talking about.

29:26.560 --> 29:30.110
I thought you said you weren't
a real hands-on teacher.

29:30.600 --> 29:32.193
I didn't teach him this.

29:32.520 --> 29:34.637
You did this to him?

29:34.800 --> 29:37.952
Yes.
And he escaped.

29:39.080 --> 29:41.072
I let him go.

29:41.800 --> 29:43.393
Like me?

29:45.520 --> 29:47.079
Not quite.

29:50.200 --> 29:52.157
Dexter? What the fuck?

29:52.640 --> 29:54.871
I told you to control yourself,
and what did you do?

29:55.040 --> 29:56.838
You killed Cassie.
Cassie?

29:57.000 --> 29:59.037
Who's Cass--?
Who the fuck is that?

29:59.400 --> 30:01.915
You killed her next door to me,
to my son!

30:02.080 --> 30:04.914
No, no, no!
I went after Shawn Decker.

30:05.080 --> 30:06.958
Shawn Decker, who is that?
Wait.

30:07.120 --> 30:09.919
Aren't you that old guy's wife?
Your ex-girlfriend?

30:10.320 --> 30:11.720
She's with me now.

30:11.880 --> 30:14.759
Nice. Did you take out
her husband?

30:18.360 --> 30:22.240
Who is Shawn Decker?
This asshole I knew in high school.

30:22.400 --> 30:25.791
He offed a girl two years ago on
spring break then bragged about it.

30:25.960 --> 30:27.792
Is she cool?
Yes.

30:27.960 --> 30:29.792
She's cool.

30:29.960 --> 30:31.394
Where were you two days ago?

30:31.600 --> 30:33.671
I stopped by your place
after you blew me off,

30:33.840 --> 30:37.197
then I came straight here.
I met your neighbour, the hot one.

30:37.360 --> 30:39.033
That was Cassie.

30:40.400 --> 30:42.551
She was alive when I left.

30:42.720 --> 30:45.952
I've been on Shawn the whole time.
I'll show you on my camera.

30:50.160 --> 30:52.629
How did you--?
How did you find me?

30:52.800 --> 30:54.678
I tracked your credit card.

30:54.840 --> 30:56.513
Right.

30:56.760 --> 30:59.195
Shouldn't use my own card,
fuck-up on my part.

30:59.360 --> 31:02.398
What'd you think of the room?
Did you do something to it?

31:02.560 --> 31:04.597
Just show me the pictures.
Sorry.

31:05.720 --> 31:07.677
This is Shawn Decker.

31:08.960 --> 31:10.599
He lives here.

31:12.080 --> 31:15.437
You can see by the time stamp,
I've been hunting him.

31:16.560 --> 31:19.394
So I decided to go after a killer.

31:21.560 --> 31:23.677
Someone who deserves it.

31:24.400 --> 31:27.916
<i>He was following the code
without even knowing it.</i>

31:28.520 --> 31:30.398
Do you have proof
that Shawn killed someone?

31:30.560 --> 31:32.631
Yeah, he pulled me aside at a party,

31:32.800 --> 31:35.952
showed me this video
of this redhead he met in Daytona.

31:36.160 --> 31:40.951
He accidentally strangled her
while they were having sex.

31:41.600 --> 31:46.277
Believe me,
world's better off without him.

31:47.880 --> 31:49.712
Where is Shawn now?

31:56.840 --> 31:58.240
It--

31:58.400 --> 32:02.917
It didn't go exactly as I planned.
I thought I could just knock him out.

32:03.080 --> 32:05.436
You sedated me, didn't you?
What did you use?

32:05.600 --> 32:07.796
What happened?
I hit him over the head,

32:07.960 --> 32:09.394
but it wasn't hard enough.

32:09.560 --> 32:14.715
He barely went down, so I just
kept hitting him, like, a lot.

32:14.880 --> 32:16.360
Did anyone see you?

32:16.520 --> 32:17.795
No, we were alone.

32:17.960 --> 32:20.395
What were you planning
on doing with the body?

32:20.560 --> 32:21.994
I didn't totally know.

32:22.160 --> 32:24.914
I was gonna come back here,
get my camera, my knives,

32:25.080 --> 32:28.391
I don't know, guess I just thought
drop him in the Everglades--

32:28.560 --> 32:31.712
So you didn't have a plan.
I did. I was gonna do it here.

32:31.880 --> 32:33.917
I mean, this place isn't bad, is it?

32:34.080 --> 32:35.958
You see that second floor?

32:36.120 --> 32:38.635
Anyone could see you
moving a body.

32:39.120 --> 32:41.635
That wasn't on the website.
Pick a different place.

32:41.800 --> 32:43.359
I'd already paid for the room.

32:43.560 --> 32:47.713
You need to have a plan
and a backup plan, always.

32:47.880 --> 32:51.510
Driving with a body in your trunk
in this heat is no plan at all.

32:51.680 --> 32:53.558
You didn't even put plastic
in your car.

32:53.720 --> 32:56.280
Oh, okay, that would've been
a good idea, yeah.

32:57.720 --> 32:59.439
You and I are gonna
deal with this body,

32:59.600 --> 33:03.196
and then scrub the car clean of DNA,
because one drop of blood,

33:03.360 --> 33:07.320
a single hair,
could lead straight back to you.

33:07.480 --> 33:09.631
Then after that,
we're gonna dump the car.

33:09.840 --> 33:12.071
Well, how am I gonna get home?

33:12.240 --> 33:14.072
We'll take you.

33:14.520 --> 33:15.556
Awesome.

33:16.800 --> 33:19.360
Can you deal with the room?
We should be a few hours.

33:19.520 --> 33:21.273
Yeah, drive safe.

33:25.440 --> 33:26.874
Dude.

33:27.040 --> 33:30.636
Do not "dude" me.
Get in the car.

33:30.800 --> 33:32.473
Watch yourself on the handle.

33:32.640 --> 33:35.394
I cut myself on that piece of shit
a few days ago.

33:38.280 --> 33:41.398
Have you cut yourself on this before?
No.

33:42.880 --> 33:48.035
<i>Is that somehow how Zach's blood
ended up under Cassie's nails?</i>

33:49.280 --> 33:51.078
I bled all over the place.

33:52.400 --> 33:53.834
Look.

33:56.920 --> 33:59.071
Fuck me. Gloves!

33:59.240 --> 34:01.436
Just put your seat belt on.

34:18.280 --> 34:20.351
Hannah-fucking-McKay.

34:21.280 --> 34:23.590
Don't even think about it.
Where's Dexter?

34:23.760 --> 34:26.559
Out.
Great, that'll make this a lot easier.

34:26.719 --> 34:28.518
I'm supposed to just put those on?

34:28.679 --> 34:31.559
You're under arrest.
You're not a police officer anymore.

34:31.719 --> 34:33.518
Citizen's arrest.
Oh, right, really?

34:33.679 --> 34:36.478
How about I arrest you
for aiding a serial killer?

34:36.639 --> 34:39.838
You want that information out?
Talk all you fucking like.

34:40.000 --> 34:44.791
No one would fucking believe you.
Better people than you have tried it.

34:44.960 --> 34:45.996
Go ahead.
No!

34:46.159 --> 34:49.630
The only way I'm leaving is if you
shoot me, and you're not gonna.

34:52.760 --> 34:56.913
I have done terrible things in my past,
but I've come to realise that as people,

34:57.080 --> 34:59.640
we're all horribly flawed,
some more than others.

34:59.800 --> 35:03.191
I'm not interested.
But we all have a will to survive,

35:03.360 --> 35:07.070
and when in extreme situations,
people do extreme things.

35:08.400 --> 35:09.834
That doesn't make it right.

35:10.040 --> 35:12.555
Right or wrong doesn't make it
into the equation.

35:12.720 --> 35:16.509
There are other forces driving us.
What's driving you?

35:17.520 --> 35:19.113
Dexter.

35:27.000 --> 35:28.992
The passing of the torch.

35:30.080 --> 35:32.390
I taught you the code.

35:32.560 --> 35:34.597
Now he's learning it from you.

35:34.760 --> 35:36.513
And look at him.

35:37.920 --> 35:40.640
You used to feel like that after a kill.

35:41.080 --> 35:44.278
At peace.
Life was so simple then.

35:45.440 --> 35:49.559
Killing consumed you,
crept into everything you did.

35:49.720 --> 35:51.712
It was all you had.

35:52.440 --> 35:54.159
But now?

35:54.720 --> 35:57.030
Now I have Harrison.

35:57.360 --> 35:59.795
He isn't a complication.

35:59.960 --> 36:01.758
Hannah is.

36:02.680 --> 36:04.672
She's more of a...

36:05.120 --> 36:06.952
distraction.

36:07.960 --> 36:11.636
Or is it possible
there's a stronger desire in you now?

36:12.000 --> 36:14.276
Stronger than the need to kill?

36:22.880 --> 36:24.997
I don't enjoy killing.

36:25.200 --> 36:26.600
Why do you do it?

36:26.760 --> 36:29.116
Sometimes it's the only way
to solve a problem.

36:29.280 --> 36:32.193
When somebody comes at me
or threatens me, my life--

36:32.360 --> 36:35.000
Like me?
I could've killed you the other day

36:35.160 --> 36:37.720
and it would've made
my life easier, but I didn't.

36:37.920 --> 36:40.594
Why?
Because I love your brother, and I--

36:40.800 --> 36:44.350
I've learned how much he cares about you.
I didn't want to hurt him.

36:48.000 --> 36:50.674
He loves me too.
Do you really want to hurt him?

36:52.360 --> 36:53.794
Fuck.

36:58.840 --> 37:01.400
My brother screws up everything.

37:12.800 --> 37:15.918
Oh, you're both still breathing.
That's a good sign.

37:16.360 --> 37:19.034
What are you doing here?
I came here for her.

37:19.200 --> 37:21.954
But how did you--?
GPS. I put it under your car.

37:22.120 --> 37:24.476
You what?
I knew you wouldn't stay away.

37:25.560 --> 37:29.520
Who the fuck are you?
Who the fuck are you?

37:32.400 --> 37:35.677
I don't want to know.
I don't want to know anything else ever.

37:35.840 --> 37:37.911
She's your problem now.

37:40.600 --> 37:42.193
Dude.

37:42.640 --> 37:45.792
I'm sorry,
you got girls fighting over you?

37:48.840 --> 37:50.354
Let's get out of here.

38:01.840 --> 38:03.479
Are we there yet?

38:11.000 --> 38:11.990
Zach.

38:12.160 --> 38:13.799
Hey.

38:13.960 --> 38:18.079
Zach, it turns out, is a fast learner.

38:19.960 --> 38:24.318
Well, I'm very relieved to hear that.
Why don't you come in, have dinner?

38:24.480 --> 38:27.120
I'm starving.
I can't.

38:29.160 --> 38:30.674
Who is that in the car?

38:32.080 --> 38:33.878
That's Hannah.

38:34.600 --> 38:36.114
Hannah McKay?

38:37.400 --> 38:39.073
You weren't going
to introduce us?

38:39.240 --> 38:43.234
Well, we've had a really long drive,
and she's leaving early tomorrow.

38:43.400 --> 38:46.120
I think we're tired.
Surely, you must be hungry.

38:46.280 --> 38:47.794
She can join us for dinner.

38:47.960 --> 38:49.519
No, that's not--
I insist.

38:50.080 --> 38:52.640
Either you invite her in or I will.

39:20.840 --> 39:24.117
Dr. Vogel, um, this is Hannah.

39:24.280 --> 39:27.318
Hi, nice to meet you.
Pleasure.

39:27.480 --> 39:29.039
Call me Evelyn.

39:33.000 --> 39:35.071
I trust there are no vegetarians here.

39:36.640 --> 39:38.154
Hand me your plate.

39:40.520 --> 39:41.920
It looks delicious.

39:42.080 --> 39:45.596
An old family recipe.
Hope it holds out.

39:45.760 --> 39:48.116
I can pass it along to you
if you'd like.

39:48.320 --> 39:50.630
I guess you know your way
around the kitchen.

39:50.800 --> 39:52.234
I'm an okay cook.

39:52.400 --> 39:54.357
You're better than okay.

39:55.000 --> 39:56.753
Well, I prefer gardening.

39:57.240 --> 39:59.357
Bringing things to life.

39:59.520 --> 40:01.113
Perfect.

40:02.080 --> 40:06.313
The best hobbies are the ones that take
us furthest from our primary occupation.

40:08.880 --> 40:10.837
So you have a fascinating field.

40:11.000 --> 40:13.231
How did you get interested in it?

40:15.160 --> 40:18.437
Oh, an incident long ago
that I won't bore you with.

40:20.160 --> 40:24.393
As to what keeps me
interested, well...

40:25.240 --> 40:27.197
look around the table.

40:28.240 --> 40:29.754
Elbows.

40:31.720 --> 40:36.715
I've always maintained that the
greatest obstacle in life isn't danger,

40:36.880 --> 40:37.996
it's boredom.

40:38.200 --> 40:40.351
Boredom?
Mm. The battle against it

40:40.520 --> 40:43.194
is responsible for most
of the events in the world,

40:43.360 --> 40:46.080
good or ill. I'm convinced of it.

40:46.760 --> 40:49.594
Anyway, my patients
never fail to surprise.

40:49.800 --> 40:53.589
They make life interesting,
thus, worth living.

40:56.480 --> 40:59.632
For example,
I would never have imagined

40:59.800 --> 41:04.238
that the affection you two share
could be possible,

41:04.440 --> 41:06.750
for people like yourselves.

41:07.560 --> 41:10.712
You are obviously
quite taken with each other.

41:11.360 --> 41:14.751
You both have
a healthy blush response.

41:15.960 --> 41:19.431
I'm embarrassing you.
Gee, you think?

41:19.600 --> 41:22.195
The truth is,
you make a good couple.

41:23.720 --> 41:25.359
And probably a bad one too.

41:25.840 --> 41:27.433
<i>Bon appétit.</i>

41:33.200 --> 41:36.511
Mm. There's too much red wine.

41:36.720 --> 41:38.871
Yeah, there is.
No, it's perfect.

41:41.760 --> 41:45.356
Dexter, you haven't said much.
Something on your mind?

41:46.840 --> 41:49.514
It's, uh, Cassie's murder.

41:50.240 --> 41:53.278
I doubt there's anything
this table can't handle.

41:57.080 --> 41:59.470
The scene, it doesn't make sense.

42:01.480 --> 42:03.358
Did you take any pictures?

42:07.320 --> 42:09.152
Whoa.

42:09.360 --> 42:11.591
It's just like Norma Rivera.

42:12.320 --> 42:14.039
Look at the blood.

42:15.240 --> 42:19.280
When someone's bludgeoned to death,
blood is no longer just blood.

42:19.440 --> 42:23.320
It's cast-off blood,
atomised blood, pooled blood.

42:23.480 --> 42:28.032
Different first names
but same family,

42:28.640 --> 42:30.950
with one story to tell.

42:32.720 --> 42:35.599
I found your blood
underneath Cassie's fingernails.

42:35.760 --> 42:38.400
But Zach had nothing to do
with Cassie's murder.

42:38.560 --> 42:40.438
So how'd my blood end up there?

42:40.600 --> 42:43.274
I'm wondering if it came
from your car door handle.

42:43.440 --> 42:46.558
Think someone could have
done that to your car on purpose?

42:46.720 --> 42:49.155
To set you up for her murder?

42:49.320 --> 42:51.915
If so, they went to
a lot of trouble to frame you.

42:52.080 --> 42:54.072
And why would someone do that?

42:54.240 --> 42:55.833
Money?

42:58.080 --> 43:00.436
You see?
Never a dull moment.

43:04.560 --> 43:08.076
Hey, look at this, full house.

43:09.280 --> 43:11.158
Welcome home.

43:12.440 --> 43:14.113
Hey, buddy, what's that?

43:14.320 --> 43:15.959
A zombie.
Nice.

43:16.120 --> 43:19.796
I hope you don't mind that we're here.
Not at all.

43:19.960 --> 43:21.917
Something happen with Quinn?

43:22.600 --> 43:24.080
No, we're fine, I just--

43:24.240 --> 43:26.675
You're still shaken up
about Cassie.

43:27.160 --> 43:28.879
Is it okay if we stay with you tonight?

43:29.760 --> 43:32.150
You two can stay here
as long as you want.

43:32.320 --> 43:34.915
Thanks.
Especially if you're gonna cook.

43:35.080 --> 43:36.992
Oh...

43:55.000 --> 43:56.514
What happened with our fugitive?

43:57.880 --> 44:00.520
Does it look like
she's handcuffed to my desk?

44:01.240 --> 44:02.959
It does not.

44:03.160 --> 44:07.393
You couldn't find her, so we will--
We'll keep looking.

44:07.560 --> 44:11.156
Oh, fuck that, Hannah's probably
left the country by now.

44:11.320 --> 44:13.152
It's a lost cause.
Heh.

44:13.640 --> 44:16.155
What happened
to Miss Personal Vendetta?

44:16.320 --> 44:19.154
She took your advice and let it go.

44:19.640 --> 44:21.916
There's a lot of money in this.

44:22.320 --> 44:24.357
I don't care about the money.

44:26.000 --> 44:27.719
What the fuck
are you doing here then?

44:30.880 --> 44:33.873
I don't know. I've been asking
myself the same question.

44:34.040 --> 44:36.635
Okay, is there something
you want to say to me?

44:37.520 --> 44:40.354
I'm not sure I'm cut out
to be a private investigator.

44:40.520 --> 44:43.672
Bullshit. Bullshit. You're the
best I've ever worked with--

44:43.840 --> 44:47.834
Given the work we do, I'm not really
sure that I want it on my tombstone.

44:48.000 --> 44:51.152
Fuck, sorry. I don't mean
to offend you or anything.

44:51.320 --> 44:54.279
It's all right, it's all right.
Forget it, forget it.

44:54.440 --> 44:58.992
I want to wake up now and then and feel like
what I do matters more than a pay cheque.

45:00.160 --> 45:02.994
Gotcha. So, what are you gonna do?
You--? You gonna--?

45:03.160 --> 45:06.073
Gonna go back to being a cop?
That what you're gonna do?

45:07.280 --> 45:09.715
I don't know, maybe. Yeah.

45:09.880 --> 45:12.679
There's a reason
they call it a public servant.

45:12.840 --> 45:16.390
You want to put your life on the line
for slave wages, be my guest.

45:16.560 --> 45:20.873
But I'd advise you to think carefully
about throwing away this opportunity.

45:27.280 --> 45:30.478
Hannah, I wish you the best of luck
with whatever's next.

45:30.640 --> 45:32.791
Thank you.
And thank you for dinner.

45:33.000 --> 45:35.720
It's refreshing to see a girl
who can really eat.

45:37.160 --> 45:38.753
We have to go.

45:38.960 --> 45:42.032
Can you drop Zach off at his home?
Of course.

45:42.200 --> 45:44.112
Can I drive?
Not a chance.

45:44.280 --> 45:46.511
My car's older than you.

45:52.320 --> 45:54.073
It's not too bad.

45:54.240 --> 45:56.277
Yeah, it's nice.

46:05.920 --> 46:08.754
I'll be by at 6 tomorrow to pick you up.
I'll take a cab.

46:08.920 --> 46:11.799
It's no problem.
I don't want to do this again. I--

46:11.960 --> 46:14.919
I can't do this again.

46:15.120 --> 46:17.476
Say goodbye.

46:20.640 --> 46:24.350
You need anything? Are you hungry?
We just ate.

46:26.280 --> 46:30.274
I'm sure if I get hungry
there's room service here.

46:30.440 --> 46:31.510
Probably.

46:32.680 --> 46:36.993
I'm just gonna shower and go to
bed, get up, go to the dock.

46:39.920 --> 46:43.880
Your plane leaves at 8:00. Twenty-seven
minutes later, you'll land in Nassau.

46:44.360 --> 46:46.591
Destroy your old passport.

46:46.760 --> 46:48.035
From there,

46:49.440 --> 46:51.591
where you go is up to you.

46:54.640 --> 46:56.359
Where do you think you'll go?

46:57.760 --> 46:59.672
Haven't decided.

47:00.800 --> 47:02.917
Argentina?

47:05.000 --> 47:06.798
Maybe.

47:10.080 --> 47:11.958
Will you let me know?

47:14.120 --> 47:15.873
Yes.

47:18.680 --> 47:20.114
Okay.

47:23.880 --> 47:25.553
I'll wait to hear from you.

47:25.720 --> 47:28.440
Dexter, my passport.

47:28.600 --> 47:30.717
Oh, right.

47:31.720 --> 47:33.632
Almost forgot.

47:41.320 --> 47:43.596
"Claire Thompson."

47:43.760 --> 47:46.116
I guess I look like a Claire.

47:47.000 --> 47:49.310
He assured me it's a name
that won't get flagged.

47:49.480 --> 47:51.039
It's perfect. Thank you.

47:51.200 --> 47:53.999
And here's a "Claire Thompson"
credit card.

47:54.160 --> 47:57.631
I have some cash too, so...
When you land in Nassau,

47:57.800 --> 48:00.759
make your last withdrawal as Maggie Castner.
Keep it under 10 grand.

48:00.920 --> 48:04.880
I can talk you through how to set up
an international bank account.

48:10.280 --> 48:12.397
You should go.

48:14.760 --> 48:16.194
I should go.

50:12.760 --> 50:14.956
<i>Every contact leaves a trace.</i>

50:16.640 --> 50:19.951
<i>Everything and everyone we touch...</i>

50:28.000 --> 50:30.720
<i>is changed in some way.</i>

50:37.680 --> 50:39.831
<i>But the changes...</i>

50:46.960 --> 50:49.919
<i>they're never what we anticipate.</i>

50:54.360 --> 51:00.550
That's right. I believe Hannah McKay was just in
Miami going under the alias of "Maggie Castner."

51:07.880 --> 51:09.439
Hannah.

51:18.440 --> 51:20.033
Don't go.

51:21.960 --> 51:23.792
Stay with me.
