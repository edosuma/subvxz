02:10.086 --> 02:11.172
Yes!

02:11.255 --> 02:12.715
Nice touch, Dad.

02:12.798 --> 02:14.550
Not bad for a dinosaur, huh?

02:14.633 --> 02:16.886
That's the shot I hit at the buzzer
to beat Franklin High.

02:16.969 --> 02:18.095
All right. What's the score?

02:18.179 --> 02:19.930
H-O-R to H-O-R-S.

02:20.014 --> 02:22.766
All right, this one's for the money, boy.

02:24.810 --> 02:25.895
Let me tell you something.

02:25.978 --> 02:28.397
You keep popping them like that,
you're looking at the starting five.

02:28.480 --> 02:30.107
- Dad...
- Excuse me, Magic,

02:30.191 --> 02:32.026
are we planning on
going to school today?

02:32.109 --> 02:33.611
Two minutes.

02:39.700 --> 02:42.411
Mom, you see?
You see why I need my own car?

02:42.494 --> 02:43.620
Brenda.

02:43.704 --> 02:45.748
I can't depend on him.
I can't get anywhere on time.

02:45.831 --> 02:47.666
And he does it on purpose
just to drive me crazy.

02:47.750 --> 02:48.834
Brenda.

02:48.917 --> 02:52.171
I've got to get control of my own destiny.
You said so yourself.

02:52.254 --> 02:55.174
Yes, but first you need to get
your driver's license, honey.

02:55.257 --> 02:57.092
I'm taking driver's training.

02:57.176 --> 02:58.510
I know.

03:04.224 --> 03:06.435
- Watch it, buddy!
- What are you yelling at?

03:06.518 --> 03:08.520
Huh! Guy cuts me off
and then flips me the bird.

03:08.604 --> 03:10.689
If you put a move on it,
maybe he wouldn't be honking at you.

03:10.772 --> 03:13.567
You are the last person in the world
who should be telling me how to drive.

03:13.650 --> 03:15.402
<i>You're always telling me about
how much power Mondale has</i>

03:15.485 --> 03:17.529
underneath the hood,
but it's like you're chicken to use it.

03:17.613 --> 03:20.282
- What is your problem this morning?
- I just don't want to be late, okay?

03:20.365 --> 03:23.160
And I just don't get
why you can't go any faster.

03:23.243 --> 03:25.328
Because it's a red light.

03:28.832 --> 03:29.958
Oh.

03:32.961 --> 03:35.630
So, you're really taking
driver's training again, huh?

03:35.714 --> 03:39.801
- Just go, okay? It's green, okay?
- Okay.

04:17.839 --> 04:19.007
Kelly!

04:19.757 --> 04:21.301
So, Brenda.

04:21.593 --> 04:23.219
So, late.

04:24.053 --> 04:25.555
So, new?

04:27.015 --> 04:28.850
So, cute.

04:29.559 --> 04:30.977
So, thanks.

04:31.269 --> 04:33.479
So, bye.

04:33.938 --> 04:35.648
- Bye.
- Bye.

04:36.024 --> 04:39.068
"Bye-yee"?
Did you hear her say "bye-yee"?

04:39.152 --> 04:42.113
Face it, Walsh.
Your sister's gone total Beverly Hills.

04:42.196 --> 04:44.323
Well, yeah, but "bye-yee"?

04:44.991 --> 04:49.704
Yeah, well, goodbye-yee.
"Parting is such sweet sorrow."

04:49.829 --> 04:53.332
Oh, but you are covering
the basketball tryouts today?

04:53.416 --> 04:56.169
Actually, I'm trying out for the team.

04:56.919 --> 04:58.170
Really?

04:59.255 --> 05:00.548
Yeah.

05:00.923 --> 05:03.050
Aren't you a little short?

05:03.884 --> 05:05.011
Thanks.

05:14.770 --> 05:16.480
- How tall is he?
- Dewitt?

05:16.564 --> 05:19.024
He's 6'6". He never misses a shot.

05:19.108 --> 05:22.486
And Clinton is 6'4".
Plays defense like King Kong.

05:23.571 --> 05:25.364
All right, now, let's go.

05:26.449 --> 05:29.910
And Andy Walker is better
than both of them combined.

05:35.749 --> 05:37.251
And that's James Townson.

05:37.334 --> 05:39.628
He's this new young hotshot
who has a chance

05:39.712 --> 05:41.714
to crack the starting line-up.

05:41.797 --> 05:43.090
It should be a good team this year.

05:43.173 --> 05:47.094
This year? Every year.
West Beverly's a perennial powerhouse.

05:47.177 --> 05:50.264
We've been league champs
four years in a row.

05:50.806 --> 05:52.474
There sure are a lot of guys
in the program.

05:52.558 --> 05:54.560
These open tryouts are a joke.

05:54.643 --> 05:57.271
Coach Reilly only holds them
to promote school spirit.

05:57.354 --> 05:59.898
Everyone knows
he's already set the line-up.

05:59.982 --> 06:02.985
Take me, for example.
I started JV last year.

06:03.110 --> 06:05.112
He practically told me
I'm practically a lock.

06:05.195 --> 06:06.238
But don't quote me on that,

06:06.321 --> 06:08.949
because I don't want to come off
as arrogant.

06:09.074 --> 06:11.660
Hey, actually, I came down
for the tryouts myself.

06:11.743 --> 06:13.871
Aren't you a little short?

06:16.873 --> 06:18.834
<i>Down on the track where it counts,</i>

06:18.917 --> 06:21.128
<i>where one mistake
can cost you your life,</i>

06:21.211 --> 06:24.298
<i>it takes a special breed of person
to handle the curves</i>

06:24.381 --> 06:26.466
<i>and keep up with the action.</i>

06:26.550 --> 06:29.344
<i>It used to be a man's game, until now.</i>

06:29.594 --> 06:33.432
<i>They say she learned to drive
on the icy streets of Minnesota.</i>

06:33.515 --> 06:35.767
<i>They say she's a flash in the pan,</i>

06:35.851 --> 06:38.687
<i>but whatever they say, the fact remains,</i>

06:38.812 --> 06:42.816
<i>Brenda Walsh is changing the way
the game is played.</i>

06:43.400 --> 06:47.737
<i>And all over America,
you can hear her fans at the finish line</i>

06:47.821 --> 06:50.615
<i>clamor for the new sensation.</i>

06:51.533 --> 06:54.369
<i>Brenda Walsh. Brenda Walsh.</i>

06:54.452 --> 06:57.163
<i>- Brenda Walsh.
- Walsh, Brenda.</i>

07:03.670 --> 07:06.798
Did you remember to bring
your parental consent form, Brenda?

07:06.881 --> 07:08.049
Thank you.

07:08.133 --> 07:10.844
- Ever taken driver training before?
- No.

07:11.720 --> 07:13.138
Not really.

07:13.847 --> 07:15.306
Well, sort of.

07:15.557 --> 07:16.850
Sort of?

07:17.225 --> 07:19.853
Well, I took private lessons
back in St. Paul,

07:19.936 --> 07:22.105
but, you see,
I have this slight perceptual problem.

07:22.188 --> 07:24.399
Brenda, Brenda,
let me put your mind at rest.

07:24.482 --> 07:25.984
What's past is past.

07:26.067 --> 07:28.736
In my class, we start with a clean slate.

07:28.820 --> 07:32.407
Who cares if you flunked
driver training once before?

07:34.367 --> 07:35.994
Twice before.

07:36.995 --> 07:38.579
Well, three times,
if you count the first time,

07:38.663 --> 07:39.747
but I only lasted 20 minutes.

07:39.831 --> 07:42.583
So I don't really think it should count.
Do you, Mr Karton?

08:03.479 --> 08:05.940
The first preseason game with
Beverly High is next week, gentlemen.

08:06.023 --> 08:09.652
The first cut will be posted
20 minutes after practice.

08:09.902 --> 08:12.196
Thank you all for coming out.

08:13.155 --> 08:16.283
The least he could do
is call us into scrimmage.

08:26.710 --> 08:29.171
Walsh, Brent, Murphy.

08:29.255 --> 08:34.009
Rotate in for Lighter, Simpkins
and Mr Walker.

08:34.135 --> 08:36.053
Feels awfully right to me.

08:36.136 --> 08:38.264
Even if you are overrated.

08:41.225 --> 08:43.143
<i>Bonne chance, big guy.</i>

09:09.211 --> 09:11.797
- Are you Walsh?
- Yes, sir.

09:16.093 --> 09:17.970
<i>That's it, Brenda. Much better.</i>

09:18.053 --> 09:19.972
You can go a little faster if you want.

09:20.055 --> 09:21.139
Really?

09:21.223 --> 09:25.894
Remember, it's 25 in a residential zone,
35 on a commercial street.

09:26.436 --> 09:28.146
How do you feel?

09:28.522 --> 09:31.191
Like I could do this even if
you weren't sitting right next to me.

09:31.274 --> 09:34.444
Oh, you can,
and you will, but be careful.

09:34.569 --> 09:37.447
All right. Let's take the big, wide turn.

09:40.367 --> 09:41.910
Not too jerky.

09:43.245 --> 09:47.499
Very good. Okay, one more time.

10:05.767 --> 10:08.687
What do you say we hang back
till the crowd thins out a little bit, huh?

10:08.770 --> 10:11.815
Don't be a squid, Walsh.
You got a 50-50 shot of making the cut.

10:11.898 --> 10:12.982
You think so?

10:13.066 --> 10:15.568
Won't know till we check it out.

10:21.449 --> 10:24.869
- I don't believe it.
- There's gotta be some kind of mistake.

10:24.953 --> 10:26.371
- Steve.
- What?

10:26.454 --> 10:29.916
Hey, I'm sorry. I was hoping
we'd get to play together this season.

10:29.999 --> 10:32.085
If you think you're gonna make it
past the next round,

10:32.168 --> 10:33.628
you are totally naive.

10:33.711 --> 10:35.421
This whole thing is rigged, anyway.

10:35.505 --> 10:38.174
- What do you mean rigged?
- Dewitt. Walker.

10:38.258 --> 10:40.760
How many of those dudes do you think
live in Beverly Hills?

10:40.843 --> 10:43.262
- A big, fat zippo.
- Hey, wait a second.

10:43.388 --> 10:45.014
I've been told you can't go
to West Beverly

10:45.098 --> 10:46.474
unless you live in the district.

10:46.557 --> 10:47.975
Unless you're a major jock.

10:48.059 --> 10:50.144
Why do you think we beat
Beverly High last year?

10:50.228 --> 10:52.772
Because they play by the rules.
We don't.

10:52.855 --> 10:54.524
How do we get around the rules?

10:54.607 --> 10:57.693
We put them in this
applied learning opportunity thing.

10:57.777 --> 10:59.278
Applied what?

10:59.403 --> 11:01.364
It's a special program for minorities,
Brandon,

11:01.447 --> 11:04.700
so we can all become
more enriched and diverse.

11:04.826 --> 11:07.119
Well, what's wrong with that?

11:07.495 --> 11:09.580
Nothing. Nothing at all.

11:09.664 --> 11:11.374
Hey, hey, come on, Steve.
I'm new around here.

11:11.457 --> 11:13.542
I don't know what's going on.

11:13.626 --> 11:15.127
Okay. Okay. You want to know?

11:15.211 --> 11:17.463
They say this program is open
to everybody,

11:17.546 --> 11:19.465
but the major requirement
is how high you can jump

11:19.548 --> 11:21.968
or how fast you can run the 100.

11:22.259 --> 11:23.469
After you've been here a while,

11:23.552 --> 11:26.555
you just may notice
that these suckers never go to class.

11:27.598 --> 11:29.558
The fact is they're getting
a free ride around here,

11:29.642 --> 11:31.435
and it makes me sick.

11:31.769 --> 11:33.813
You can quote me on that.

11:46.575 --> 11:51.247
- I ain't going through no initiation thing.
- Oh, no, don't sweat it. Don't even trip.

12:07.888 --> 12:09.098
Hey, Nat.

12:09.181 --> 12:11.558
Hey. What are you doing here?
Looking for a free meal?

12:11.642 --> 12:13.477
No. Actually I'm looking for
my pay check.

12:13.560 --> 12:16.313
Pay check? And all this time I thought
you were working for me

12:16.396 --> 12:18.023
out of the goodness of your heart.

12:18.106 --> 12:21.193
Unfortunately, my car insurance
costs more than my heart.

12:21.276 --> 12:23.362
Welcome to LA.
Give me a few minutes, okay?

12:23.445 --> 12:25.155
No problem, Nat.

12:25.697 --> 12:27.157
Hey, James.

12:29.952 --> 12:33.038
I'm Brandon Walsh. I fed you
a couple of buckets at tryouts today.

12:33.121 --> 12:35.123
- Right.
- Yo, James. Out the door.

12:35.207 --> 12:36.625
- All right, I gotta jet.
- It's cool.

12:36.708 --> 12:38.377
I just wanted to say, you know,

12:38.460 --> 12:40.962
good luck, and I hope to be
playing with you this season.

12:41.046 --> 12:42.714
Yeah, all right.

12:42.798 --> 12:45.467
Dude has no chance
of making the team.

12:53.308 --> 12:55.769
You can't let a little competition
get you down.

12:55.852 --> 12:57.020
Little?

12:57.103 --> 12:59.856
Dad, the starting five
is right out of the land of the giants.

12:59.940 --> 13:02.359
You sound as if
making the first cut was a fluke.

13:02.442 --> 13:05.111
No. No. It's just, well, like I told you,

13:05.195 --> 13:07.489
they recruit a lot of the players
from out of the district.

13:07.572 --> 13:09.532
Some of these guys are like pros.

13:09.616 --> 13:13.453
What are you psyching yourself out for?
You read Bobby Knight's book.

13:13.536 --> 13:15.664
Winning is a state of mind.

13:15.747 --> 13:16.831
Bobby who?

13:16.915 --> 13:20.251
And if you have the tools and the guts
and the desire,

13:20.335 --> 13:23.797
you can meet any challenge
and accomplish any goal.

13:24.672 --> 13:28.093
Thanks for dinner, Mom.
The pep talk was inspiring.

13:29.469 --> 13:30.970
I heard that.

13:31.387 --> 13:33.097
Glad someone did.

13:38.102 --> 13:39.812
What's with her?

13:45.276 --> 13:46.361
No.

13:47.153 --> 13:48.279
What?

13:49.364 --> 13:54.452
Hey, Bren, I love you,
you're the better half,

13:54.744 --> 13:57.538
but don't fight my battles for me, okay?

13:57.622 --> 14:02.293
Brandon, every year it's the same
"winning is a state of mind" speech.

14:02.376 --> 14:06.339
The same big shot at the buzzer.
The same rah-rah, rah-rah.

14:06.464 --> 14:08.466
It's just Dad being Dad.

14:08.591 --> 14:10.134
How can you stand it?

14:10.218 --> 14:12.303
It just rolls off my back.

14:12.470 --> 14:14.055
It really does.

14:17.642 --> 14:19.435
- Bye.
- Bye.

14:19.936 --> 14:21.312
"Bye-yee?"

14:22.605 --> 14:27.443
Don't worry, mother. We're just going
upstairs to study for our Spanish test.

14:32.323 --> 14:34.116
Do we love this nail polish?

14:36.827 --> 14:39.705
- So what about tomorrow night?
- You heard my mom.

14:39.789 --> 14:42.208
Monday through Thursdays
I'm totally book-bound.

14:42.291 --> 14:44.251
So tell her you're going to the library.

14:44.335 --> 14:47.796
Kel, I could never pull it off.
I'm the world's worst liar.

14:47.880 --> 14:50.633
Please, Brenda.
Look, blind dates aren't my thing either,

14:50.716 --> 14:53.677
but Kenny swears his friend
is totally delectable.

14:53.761 --> 14:55.429
You said the last time
you went out with Kenny

14:55.512 --> 14:57.056
he was weird and obnoxious.

14:57.139 --> 14:58.390
He was.

14:58.474 --> 15:01.810
Then why would you want to
go out with him again?

15:02.519 --> 15:04.021
You are bad.

15:04.104 --> 15:06.523
Look, they're getting front-row tickets
to the Janet Jackson concert

15:06.607 --> 15:08.734
and renting a limo. It'll be fun.
What do you say?

15:08.817 --> 15:10.986
<i>- Can I count on you, amigo?
- It's amiga.</i>

15:11.070 --> 15:14.198
You have to use the feminine form
of the noun.

15:14.364 --> 15:15.616
Thanks.

15:17.159 --> 15:18.577
Where are you going?

15:18.660 --> 15:20.412
Where do you think?

15:26.084 --> 15:29.213
Ten seconds left on the clock.
The Lakers down by one.

15:29.296 --> 15:31.381
Magic, dribbling at the top of the key,

15:31.465 --> 15:34.509
swings it over to Vlade.
Six seconds left.

15:34.593 --> 15:36.595
Back to Magic,
who kicks it over to Walsh.

15:36.678 --> 15:39.806
Walsh, who shoots. At the buzzer.
For the game.

15:41.850 --> 15:44.436
Walsh. At the buzzer! For the game!

15:45.437 --> 15:47.522
One more time. At the buzzer.
For the game.

15:47.606 --> 15:51.193
It's good. It's good.
Walsh does it again! The Lakers win!

15:51.276 --> 15:54.362
The Lakers win
the World Championships! Yes!

15:56.573 --> 15:58.283
Nice shot, champ.

16:08.210 --> 16:10.295
I was really, really sick for a while,
but don't worry,

16:10.378 --> 16:12.047
I'm not contagious anymore.

16:12.130 --> 16:14.549
That depends on how you look at it.

16:15.008 --> 16:17.552
- Hey, Steve. How you doing?
- Okay.

16:17.719 --> 16:19.596
You were probably wondering
why you didn't see me

16:19.679 --> 16:20.930
around school last week.

16:21.014 --> 16:23.308
- Not really.
- I was out with the flu.

16:23.391 --> 16:24.809
I didn't notice.

16:24.893 --> 16:27.145
Oh, yeah.
The doctor had to put me on antibiotics.

16:27.228 --> 16:29.397
And you actually lived
to tell about it, huh?

16:29.481 --> 16:30.648
Yep.

16:31.483 --> 16:33.485
Amazing. Truly amazing.

16:34.194 --> 16:36.196
Well, thanks, Steve.
It's great to be back.

16:36.279 --> 16:38.072
I'll see you around.

16:38.656 --> 16:40.116
Jordan, how you doing, man?

16:41.075 --> 16:43.077
- Hey, Brandon.
- Hey, Steve. How you doing?

16:43.161 --> 16:44.329
- All right, how you doing?
- Good.

16:44.412 --> 16:45.663
Listen, I almost called you last night.

16:45.747 --> 16:47.582
I had an extra ticket
to the Lakers-Celtics game.

16:47.665 --> 16:49.125
Oh, man, you should've called me.

16:49.208 --> 16:51.085
I know, I'm sorry,
but it was a last-minute kind of thing.

16:51.169 --> 16:52.295
So, how was Magic?

16:52.378 --> 16:54.631
Magic was magic,
but Bird was unstoppable,

16:54.714 --> 16:56.424
and McHale owned the boards.

16:56.507 --> 16:58.176
Wait a minute,
I thought you were a Lakers fan.

16:58.259 --> 16:59.844
Except when the Celtics come to town.

16:59.927 --> 17:01.262
Why, were you born in Boston?

17:01.346 --> 17:03.431
No, I'm a Beverly Hills native.

17:03.514 --> 17:05.308
So what were you doing
rooting for the Celtics?

17:05.391 --> 17:09.353
Us Irish guys have got to stick together.
You know how it is.

17:09.979 --> 17:11.439
How what is?

17:12.022 --> 17:14.317
Walsh, take care of yourself.

17:17.569 --> 17:19.321
- See you.
- See you.

17:27.538 --> 17:31.709
And the most rad part is
I designed it to pump 5,000 oscillations

17:31.792 --> 17:36.881
at 1.78 per second to compensate
for any surge in the electrical output.

17:38.215 --> 17:40.468
So how come it doesn't work?

17:41.010 --> 17:42.511
I don't know.

17:44.138 --> 17:46.974
Since the shutter is concave
and the condenser is convex,

17:47.057 --> 17:49.852
it allows the image to remain balanced.

17:50.060 --> 17:52.146
Good work, Brandon. Excellent.

17:52.229 --> 17:54.148
- Miss Yamado.
- Oh, hello, James.

17:54.231 --> 17:56.150
Did you get a chance
to do the assignment?

17:56.233 --> 17:57.776
Now that's what I wanted
to talk to you about.

17:57.860 --> 17:59.695
I'm still working on it.

17:59.778 --> 18:01.572
- James...
- But I'll have it for you Monday.

18:01.655 --> 18:03.365
For sure. Really.

18:04.074 --> 18:05.242
Okay.

18:07.911 --> 18:10.497
I didn't know you were taking tech.

18:10.998 --> 18:13.250
Well, I'm enrolled in it,
but you know how it is

18:13.334 --> 18:15.711
coming to a new school and all.

18:24.678 --> 18:26.889
- What do you have next period?
- Driver's training.

18:26.972 --> 18:29.892
- Driver's training?
- It's just a refresher course.

18:29.975 --> 18:32.728
Listen, four weeks into the semester,
the guy hasn't shown up once.

18:32.811 --> 18:33.937
Doesn't that tell you something?

18:34.021 --> 18:37.482
Yeah, it tells me that this James guy
isn't one of your basic overachievers.

18:37.566 --> 18:40.193
Well, from what Steve Sanders says,
the applied learning program

18:40.277 --> 18:42.279
has been giving preferential treatment
to jocks for years.

18:42.362 --> 18:44.781
Look, the fact is, the ALOP
has a great reputation,

18:44.865 --> 18:47.117
and, I'm sorry,
Steve Sanders is a spoiled slug

18:47.200 --> 18:49.453
who doesn't come close
to being a credible news source.

18:49.536 --> 18:52.247
But that doesn't mean there aren't
hundreds of so-called student athletes

18:52.331 --> 18:53.707
playing college ball around this country

18:53.790 --> 18:55.751
who can't even spell
their own names, okay?

18:55.834 --> 18:58.128
And that that kind
of preferential BS treatment

18:58.211 --> 18:59.671
starts right here at the high school level.

18:59.755 --> 19:01.423
Look, if you think
you have a major story,

19:01.506 --> 19:04.050
set up an interview and go for it.

19:10.182 --> 19:12.893
Actually, I was hoping you'd run with it.

19:12.976 --> 19:15.186
Me, cover sports? Not likely.

19:15.270 --> 19:17.772
Come on. I can't write this.
It's a blatant conflict of interest.

19:17.856 --> 19:19.482
Only if you make the team,
which rumor has it

19:19.566 --> 19:20.734
is something less than a sure thing.

19:20.817 --> 19:23.361
But no matter when I write it,
everyone will say it's sour grapes.

19:23.445 --> 19:24.904
Well, is it?

19:25.071 --> 19:26.865
You don't think it's unfair
they bring a guy in

19:26.948 --> 19:29.826
from out of district to play basketball?

19:30.160 --> 19:31.578
No comment.

19:32.162 --> 19:34.581
No comment? What does that mean?

19:34.748 --> 19:36.708
It means I live out of district,
remember?

19:36.791 --> 19:39.002
Andrea, this isn't about geography.

19:39.085 --> 19:41.421
That's right. It's about race.

19:41.963 --> 19:43.465
That is not true.

19:43.548 --> 19:45.592
Look, if you don't want to do
the legwork, fine.

19:45.675 --> 19:49.262
Just don't put me down
for trying to bring a killer story to print.

19:49.345 --> 19:50.763
Okay, okay.

19:51.890 --> 19:54.225
Give me a couple of names and

19:54.642 --> 19:58.771
maybe I will drop by the ALOP office
and see what I can dig up.

19:59.814 --> 20:01.107
Thanks.

20:03.109 --> 20:04.569
Driving is a cinch.

20:04.652 --> 20:06.779
It is a cinch as long as you stay

20:06.863 --> 20:08.489
on your side of the road.

20:08.573 --> 20:10.575
Well, I only swerved
when the dog started barking.

20:10.658 --> 20:14.287
I thought he was gonna dart out
into the street, until I saw his leash.

20:14.370 --> 20:16.581
But you never know what a poodle
is going to do, right?

20:16.664 --> 20:19.667
You're doing wonderfully, Brenda.
You truly are.

20:19.792 --> 20:22.378
- We're approaching a stop sign.
- I see it.

20:22.461 --> 20:26.924
So let's come to a complete stop
this time, behind the crosswalk.

20:27.717 --> 20:29.594
No California rolls.

20:30.845 --> 20:32.013
Perfect.

20:32.597 --> 20:34.807
So do you think I'm ready
to go for my license yet?

20:34.890 --> 20:37.476
Pretty soon.
Yield to the car on the right,

20:37.560 --> 20:39.937
and then proceed
through the intersection.

20:40.021 --> 20:42.231
Oh, looks like Henry Winkler.

20:42.481 --> 20:43.774
That's not him.

20:43.858 --> 20:46.402
Brenda, you have the right of way.

20:49.363 --> 20:51.031
That is Henry Winkler!

20:51.115 --> 20:52.366
Brenda!

21:03.878 --> 21:06.171
Rebound. Rebound.

21:10.217 --> 21:13.220
Set it up. Set it up. Good shot.

21:18.309 --> 21:19.893
Come on, hustle back.

21:28.152 --> 21:29.945
All right. All right.

21:34.992 --> 21:37.452
Good move, Andy. Mid-season form.

21:37.536 --> 21:39.746
Hustle back now, hustle back.

21:40.747 --> 21:43.542
That's good. Set it up. Set it up.

21:45.711 --> 21:47.588
Set it up. Come on.

21:49.381 --> 21:50.674
Take it.

21:51.675 --> 21:53.218
Come on, man.
Let's play some defense.

21:53.302 --> 21:55.345
Get in the game, Walsh.

21:57.014 --> 21:59.099
Let's do it, let's do it.

21:59.266 --> 22:00.934
Set it up. Set it up.

22:18.326 --> 22:19.661
Charging.

22:24.499 --> 22:26.042
Hey, watch it.

22:33.925 --> 22:36.094
We're down to the final cut.

22:36.177 --> 22:37.345
That's what I hear.

22:37.429 --> 22:39.639
Coach Reilly told me he was
very impressed with your hustle.

22:39.723 --> 22:42.183
And so am I. I've never seen you play
with this kind of intensity.

22:42.267 --> 22:43.768
What did you have to go
talk to him for, Dad?

22:43.852 --> 22:44.978
He introduced himself to me.

22:45.061 --> 22:47.355
What was I supposed to do?
Walk away? Not shake his hand?

22:47.439 --> 22:49.941
- No.
- So what's the big deal?

22:50.233 --> 22:51.901
I had a meeting down at Century City.

22:51.985 --> 22:55.446
Back home I used to watch you practice
all the time.

22:58.283 --> 23:01.202
It's no big deal. I'll see you later, okay?

23:02.579 --> 23:03.871
Brandon.

23:04.622 --> 23:05.957
Don't worry.

23:06.040 --> 23:09.168
You play like you did today, you got
a legitimate shot at making the team.

23:09.252 --> 23:11.546
Either way, I'm proud of you.

23:18.886 --> 23:20.805
James Townson,
is he the kid in your tech class?

23:20.888 --> 23:22.181
- Yeah.
- Well, he must be

23:22.265 --> 23:24.016
an awfully hot prospect.

23:24.142 --> 23:25.768
Why? What'd you find out?

23:25.852 --> 23:28.813
According to my source in the ALOP,
there are four guys

23:28.896 --> 23:31.941
currently playing varsity basketball
involved with the program.

23:32.024 --> 23:33.484
And they say they're doing fairly well.

23:33.568 --> 23:35.236
What would you expect them to say?

23:35.319 --> 23:37.405
Brandon, will you let me finish?

23:37.488 --> 23:40.700
The key thing is, they have no record
of your friend James

23:40.783 --> 23:43.744
ever having taken
a reading or math placement test,

23:43.828 --> 23:46.914
a basic requirement
for all sophomores on this campus.

23:46.998 --> 23:48.499
- I knew it.
- It gets worse.

23:48.582 --> 23:52.837
His transcripts from his last school
were somehow never processed.

23:53.379 --> 23:57.758
He is the only student in West Beverly
without a grade point average.

24:02.179 --> 24:04.098
You're on him, right there.

24:05.724 --> 24:08.853
Look, do you want to talk to him,
or should I?

24:09.311 --> 24:10.813
I'll do it.

24:14.942 --> 24:16.986
James, you got a second?

24:17.945 --> 24:20.281
I'll catch up with you later.

24:20.823 --> 24:21.949
Listen, Brandon.

24:22.032 --> 24:24.034
I lost it out there, and I apologize.

24:24.118 --> 24:25.661
You don't deserve this kind of garbage.

24:25.744 --> 24:26.995
- Listen...
- Just let me say.

24:27.079 --> 24:29.206
I saw that little bump-and-run
that Walker laid on you,

24:29.289 --> 24:31.166
and I told him it was a cheap shot,

24:31.250 --> 24:33.669
but being the new kid on the block,
he's just looking out for me.

24:33.752 --> 24:35.087
That's all it is.

24:35.170 --> 24:38.006
A lot of people looking out
for you, aren't there, James?

24:38.090 --> 24:39.842
I guess they are.

24:39.925 --> 24:42.427
<i>Look, I'm the sports editor
on the West Beverly Blaze.</i>

24:42.511 --> 24:44.096
- The school paper?
- Yeah.

24:44.179 --> 24:46.598
And we have reason to believe
you've been recruited here

24:46.682 --> 24:50.644
to play basketball in exchange
for certain special privileges.

24:50.727 --> 24:53.105
- Say what?
- Come on, James.

24:53.313 --> 24:55.440
You live out of district.
You never go to class,

24:55.524 --> 24:58.610
and I understand your transcript
doesn't show any prior grades

24:58.694 --> 25:00.570
or test scores
or anything to indicate that

25:00.654 --> 25:02.823
you even have the minimum
requirements to be at this school,

25:02.906 --> 25:04.074
or any school, for that matter.

25:04.157 --> 25:06.118
Who gave you the right
to be poking around with my records?

25:06.201 --> 25:07.786
- That's not the issue.
- It is too the issue!

25:07.869 --> 25:09.287
If I was white,
you wouldn't be doing this!

25:09.371 --> 25:12.416
I don't care if you're white or black.
You shouldn't be here on a free pass.

25:12.499 --> 25:13.875
Yeah, right.

25:16.294 --> 25:19.089
The truth is going to come out, James.

25:33.270 --> 25:35.814
Goodbye, Kelly. Kelly, goodbye.

25:36.523 --> 25:38.775
I'm gone. I went. Goodbye.

25:39.526 --> 25:41.361
Kelly, call me. Bye.

25:42.946 --> 25:44.823
She is so nuts, that girl.

25:44.948 --> 25:47.909
Because Mom and Dad are going out
tonight, she thinks I should sneak out

25:47.992 --> 25:50.787
on this blind date with her
and a guy she just met.

25:50.870 --> 25:54.374
Brenda. Don't do it.
You know you'll only get caught.

25:54.749 --> 25:56.835
Brandon, I'm not a fool.

25:57.544 --> 25:59.963
Although they are renting a limo.

26:00.505 --> 26:01.881
Hey, do you want half, or what?

26:01.965 --> 26:04.425
No, thanks.
I'm just gonna grab something later.

26:04.509 --> 26:08.304
Be careful up there. Dad just found
his yearbook in the garage.

26:09.180 --> 26:10.390
Again.

26:17.021 --> 26:20.233
Kennedy was a lug of lard,
but he made a fortune in real estate.

26:20.316 --> 26:22.151
He must've had something on the ball.

26:22.235 --> 26:25.196
O'Brien had a nice touch
for a role player.

26:25.613 --> 26:27.198
I had my moments,

26:27.323 --> 26:31.035
especially when I nailed that shot
at the buzzer to beat Franklin.

26:31.119 --> 26:35.790
We weren't a gifted bunch, but together
we pulled off a championship season.

26:35.873 --> 26:40.294
Teamwork, that's the key, Brandon.
That's what you have to strive for.

26:42.546 --> 26:44.674
You rush me
to get me out of the door by 7:15,

26:44.757 --> 26:46.676
you're not even dressed yet.

26:46.759 --> 26:48.719
How did it get to be so late?

26:48.886 --> 26:52.640
Time flies when you're double-dribbling
down memory lane.

26:53.265 --> 26:57.019
- Hey, you look real nice, Mom.
- I'm glad someone noticed.

26:57.103 --> 26:58.646
What time are you gonna be
home tonight?

26:58.729 --> 27:00.773
I don't know. I got the late shift.

27:00.856 --> 27:03.901
The final day of tryouts is tomorrow
and you're working the late shift?

27:03.984 --> 27:05.986
Well, if you'd pay
my car insurance, Dad,

27:06.070 --> 27:08.697
I'd happily take an early retirement.

27:08.781 --> 27:11.784
If you make the team tomorrow,
maybe we'll talk about it.

27:11.867 --> 27:13.118
Really?

27:13.202 --> 27:15.120
- Absolutely.
- Jim!

27:15.996 --> 27:17.748
Well, that's bribery.

27:17.831 --> 27:20.334
A little incentive program
never hurt anybody.

27:20.417 --> 27:23.837
Besides, in my humble opinion,
I've always felt student athletes

27:23.921 --> 27:26.924
deserve a little bonus
for putting in all those extra hours.

27:27.007 --> 27:28.133
Do yourself a favor.

27:28.217 --> 27:31.011
From now on, do not,
under any circumstances,

27:31.095 --> 27:34.681
listen to anything that man has to say
about anything.

27:34.765 --> 27:36.308
Do you hear me?

27:40.938 --> 27:42.272
Brandon?

28:06.797 --> 28:07.923
Hello.

28:08.006 --> 28:10.133
<i>- Rescue me.
- Where are you?</i>

28:10.425 --> 28:11.676
In hell.

28:12.511 --> 28:14.054
<i>It's not funny.</i>

28:14.221 --> 28:16.807
Janet Jackson has laryngitis.
Kenny is drunk.

28:16.932 --> 28:18.225
And you have to come and get me.

28:18.517 --> 28:19.643
Why do I have to?

28:19.851 --> 28:21.645
Because,
if you would've gone out with us,

28:21.728 --> 28:23.647
Kenny wouldn't have puked
all over the limo.

28:24.231 --> 28:25.357
Gross.

28:25.732 --> 28:28.068
<i>Molto gross.
How soon can you be here?</i>

28:28.443 --> 28:30.070
Kelly, come on. Can't you take a cab?

28:30.403 --> 28:32.364
I am hanging up now. Have a nice life.

28:32.572 --> 28:33.949
How can you ask me to pick you up?

28:34.032 --> 28:36.034
You know I don't have
a California driver's license.

28:36.201 --> 28:37.410
But you're a good driver, right?

28:37.661 --> 28:38.912
<i>That is what you said, right?</i>

28:38.995 --> 28:40.664
- Well, yeah.
- So?

28:41.998 --> 28:45.543
<i>So Brandon took his bike to work.
I guess I can borrow Mondale.</i>

28:45.752 --> 28:46.836
You guys have a driver?

28:47.170 --> 28:50.548
<i>No. Mondale's the name of his car.
It's for Walter Mondale.</i>

28:51.758 --> 28:53.927
<i>He ran for president against Reagan.</i>

28:55.220 --> 28:57.180
- From Minnesota.
- Look, whatever.

28:57.263 --> 29:00.433
Look, if you took the car out right now,
you'd be back in 10 minutes max.

29:00.517 --> 29:01.643
Kelly, I don't know.

29:01.726 --> 29:04.395
Come on.
Brandon will never know the difference.

29:04.479 --> 29:06.314
Please. You're my best friend.

29:07.232 --> 29:09.525
- I am?
- Please?

29:13.404 --> 29:16.032
Honk if you're obnoxious! You creep!

29:16.699 --> 29:19.202
Just forget him. Just forget him.

29:19.369 --> 29:22.789
You're doing fine.
You're doing finer than fine. You're fine.

29:22.872 --> 29:25.166
Oh, where the hell is Doheny?

29:25.249 --> 29:28.252
Okay, come on, Brenda. Come on.
Don't lose it, baby.

29:28.336 --> 29:30.630
You're doing great.
Everything's under control.

29:30.713 --> 29:34.008
I mean, you know how to drive.
You're a good driver.

29:34.092 --> 29:37.804
You're a great driver.
You're a terrific driver. You're...

29:39.514 --> 29:40.932
Out of gas?

30:21.180 --> 30:22.264
Hi.

30:22.514 --> 30:23.807
How's it going?

30:23.891 --> 30:27.728
Bad and getting worse.
My car ran out of gas.

30:27.853 --> 30:30.272
Actually, it's my brother's car.

30:30.356 --> 30:32.441
- It happens.
- Mostly to me.

30:32.524 --> 30:34.234
I've been driving around
for the past 20 minutes

30:34.318 --> 30:36.111
trying to get to Doheny and Melrose.

30:36.195 --> 30:38.405
Two dollars for the deposit.

30:40.908 --> 30:44.203
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

30:44.411 --> 30:46.580
You don't have your wallet.

30:46.789 --> 30:48.665
I am so bummed.

30:49.166 --> 30:50.542
These things happen.

30:50.626 --> 30:52.586
- So bummed.
- They happen.

30:52.795 --> 30:55.047
It's in my other jacket.
I promise. I swear.

30:55.130 --> 30:56.840
It's okay. Things happen.

30:56.924 --> 31:00.928
Look, I'll pay you back
first thing tomorrow. I promise I will.

31:01.178 --> 31:03.180
Where's your car parked?

31:08.018 --> 31:11.605
I swear the car was right here
15 minutes ago! I swear it was.

31:11.688 --> 31:13.273
You sure this is where you left it?

31:13.357 --> 31:15.442
My brother is going to kill me.

31:15.525 --> 31:17.819
Just tell him things happen.

31:18.528 --> 31:23.658
You see, with mayonnaise
you can't be too specific, okay?

31:25.494 --> 31:28.997
Iceberg lettuce, Romaine lettuce,
red-leaf lettuce.

31:29.289 --> 31:33.835
You can put on as much as you want,
as long as it's fresh and crunchy.

31:34.127 --> 31:36.463
But mayonnaise is an acquired taste.

31:36.546 --> 31:37.672
Nat...

31:37.756 --> 31:41.176
And, you know, if you put too much in,
it's too soggy.

31:41.301 --> 31:42.719
Too little, it's too dry.

31:42.802 --> 31:45.597
And then when you factor in the mustard
and the luncheon meats,

31:45.680 --> 31:48.224
well, you can see it takes
years of practice to get it right.

31:48.308 --> 31:51.394
That's why I was hoping we could start
practicing tomorrow night.

31:51.478 --> 31:52.854
What, are you in a hurry?

31:52.937 --> 31:54.314
I got to get these books
back to the library

31:54.397 --> 31:56.483
before they start costing me.

31:56.566 --> 31:59.569
I knew there was a reason I hired you.
Get out of here.

31:59.652 --> 32:01.529
- Thanks, Nat.
- See you tomorrow.

32:01.613 --> 32:03.031
All right.

32:03.990 --> 32:05.033
He's nice.

32:23.009 --> 32:24.927
What are you doing here?

32:25.053 --> 32:27.138
I don't have to justify myself to you.

32:27.221 --> 32:28.765
Hey, I just asked a simple question.

32:28.848 --> 32:31.392
No, it's not simple at all.
What you are really asking is,

32:31.476 --> 32:34.103
"How come a dumb black jock
who can't read and who..."

32:34.187 --> 32:36.272
- Hey, I never said that, James.
- Right.

32:36.355 --> 32:37.607
If you just would answer my questions

32:37.690 --> 32:39.317
about the Applied Learning
Opportunity Program.

32:39.400 --> 32:41.152
How the hell should I know about the
learning program?

32:41.235 --> 32:42.361
I'm not a part of it!

32:42.445 --> 32:43.988
You weren't recruited here
to play basketball?

32:44.071 --> 32:45.156
That's right.

32:45.239 --> 32:47.450
But you don't live in the district, do you?

32:47.533 --> 32:49.076
Caught me red-handed.

32:49.202 --> 32:50.536
I just want to know
how you got permission

32:50.620 --> 32:52.038
to go to school in the district.

32:52.121 --> 32:53.289
I don't need permission.

32:53.372 --> 32:57.627
My father has worked for the
Beverly Hills City Library for 15 years!

32:57.752 --> 33:00.212
And that gives me as much right
to be here as anyone.

33:00.296 --> 33:02.089
- Hold it down, please. It's a library.
- Including you.

33:02.173 --> 33:04.550
So the reason the ALOP office
didn't have your records

33:04.633 --> 33:06.135
is because you're not part
of their program?

33:06.218 --> 33:08.846
I already told you. I'm here
because my father earned the right

33:08.929 --> 33:11.932
for me to be here, not because
I was recruited or because I want to be.

33:12.016 --> 33:14.685
- I don't know what to say.
- Then why don't you try saying nothing?

33:14.769 --> 33:16.604
See, I was getting by fine in Inglewood,

33:16.687 --> 33:19.106
when my parents decided it was time
to upgrade my education

33:19.190 --> 33:20.399
four weeks into the semester!

33:20.483 --> 33:22.485
Making me have to play
catch-up from the get-go.

33:22.568 --> 33:24.361
- Sounds like what happened to me.
- Yeah, right.

33:24.445 --> 33:26.280
That's why your old man
tried to suck up to the coach.

33:26.363 --> 33:27.907
Hey, that's not what went down at all!

33:27.990 --> 33:30.868
I love it! You rich white boys,
you get the world handed to you,

33:30.951 --> 33:33.662
no strings attached, and you honestly
think that's how it is for everyone.

33:33.746 --> 33:36.040
Excuse me, I don't know whose
bank account you've been looking at,

33:36.123 --> 33:37.207
but I am not rich.

33:37.291 --> 33:38.334
Yeah, but you're white,

33:38.417 --> 33:41.837
and that's why your first impulse
was to think, "Hey, he's gotta be dumb

33:41.920 --> 33:45.257
"or a rap singer or in a gang
or smoking crack"

33:45.716 --> 33:47.926
or whatever stereotype fits your fears.

33:48.010 --> 33:50.846
But that's your problem.
That's not my problem.

33:50.929 --> 33:54.141
So what if I need a little extra help
adjusting to life at the almighty

33:54.224 --> 33:56.226
West Beverly High School?

33:56.310 --> 34:00.564
So what if I use my God-given talent
to get me into the college of my choice?

34:00.647 --> 34:03.775
I ain't got nothing to hide,
got nothing to be ashamed of

34:03.859 --> 34:06.194
and nothing more to say to you.

34:23.879 --> 34:25.714
- Mom?
- Brandon.

34:28.216 --> 34:30.051
We called you at work,
but you'd already left.

34:30.135 --> 34:31.887
What's the matter?

34:32.262 --> 34:34.264
Your car has been stolen.

34:34.598 --> 34:36.558
<i>Mondale's been stolen?</i>

34:37.391 --> 34:38.810
How did that happen?

34:38.893 --> 34:41.730
It was a professional wiring job.
We've seen it before.

34:41.813 --> 34:43.940
They must've come
right up the driveway.

34:44.024 --> 34:46.860
Why would anyone in Beverly Hills
wanna steal a '78 bomber?

34:46.943 --> 34:49.321
Once you cross the border,
a power engine in good condition

34:49.404 --> 34:52.197
can bring three times its market value.

34:52.866 --> 34:54.993
My engine was in mint condition.

34:55.076 --> 34:56.995
I'm so sorry, Brandon.

34:57.245 --> 34:58.330
We're all sorry,

34:58.413 --> 35:00.749
but the best thing you can do now, son,
is to put it to bed

35:00.832 --> 35:03.710
and give it our best shot tomorrow, huh?

35:04.794 --> 35:07.380
What if I don't give it
my best shot tomorrow, Dad?

35:07.464 --> 35:09.674
Like I already said,
if you don't make the team,

35:09.757 --> 35:10.967
the sun still shines, the moon still...

35:11.050 --> 35:12.927
No, I mean what if I don't even
try out tomorrow?

35:13.011 --> 35:15.638
What if I just quit the team right now?

35:15.722 --> 35:18.308
Brandon, what's the matter?
We'll find you a different car.

35:18.391 --> 35:20.643
- Who said I wanted a different car?
- I just assumed...

35:20.727 --> 35:22.562
That's right. You assumed.

35:22.645 --> 35:24.314
You assumed I wanted a different car.

35:24.397 --> 35:26.858
You assumed I wanted
to play high school basketball.

35:26.941 --> 35:28.943
You assumed I wanted to move
to Beverly Hills.

35:29.027 --> 35:30.945
But you never came out and asked me.

35:31.029 --> 35:32.322
You just jumped
to your own conclusions,

35:32.405 --> 35:34.157
'cause that's what you wanted
to believe.

35:34.866 --> 35:36.617
Well, guess again.

35:40.705 --> 35:42.915
How can you say I push him too hard?

35:42.999 --> 35:45.460
I'm not overcritical or overbearing.

35:45.543 --> 35:48.421
But you don't take a low profile, either.

35:49.005 --> 35:50.798
Okay, maybe I prod him a little,

35:50.882 --> 35:53.843
but that's because Brandon
is a natural athlete.

35:53.926 --> 35:56.387
He's much better than I ever was.

35:56.470 --> 35:59.015
All he needs is a little motivation.

35:59.098 --> 36:00.933
And a little space

36:01.225 --> 36:03.019
and the room to fail

36:03.269 --> 36:06.188
and the freedom to be his own person.

36:09.442 --> 36:12.903
Okay, yeah.
Maybe he could use a little of that, too.

36:20.703 --> 36:21.787
Brandon.

36:21.871 --> 36:23.956
When they came up the driveway
to steal the car,

36:24.039 --> 36:26.625
how come you didn't hear anything?

36:31.755 --> 36:34.216
How could you take my car
without asking me?

36:34.300 --> 36:37.303
Kelly was in such dire straits,
I didn't even stop to think about it.

36:37.386 --> 36:40.598
Well, that's the way it's been ever since
we moved to Beverly Hills, Bren.

36:40.681 --> 36:44.184
You're not stopping and thinking about
anyone or anything, except for Kelly

36:44.268 --> 36:46.103
and her little inner circle,
and you know what?

36:46.186 --> 36:47.813
It's getting real boring.

36:47.896 --> 36:51.108
Brandon, you're right. You are.
And I'm going to pay you back.

36:51.191 --> 36:53.986
I promise, I'll do anything you want.

36:54.069 --> 36:55.738
Just don't tell Mom. Please.

36:55.821 --> 36:57.156
Don't tell her what?
That you took my car,

36:57.239 --> 36:58.699
or that you lied to her about it?

36:58.782 --> 37:01.326
<i>How was I supposed to know
Mondale was running out of gas?</i>

37:01.410 --> 37:04.663
You check the gas gauge,
like any qualified driver.

37:04.746 --> 37:06.415
You get in the car.
You put on your seatbelt.

37:06.498 --> 37:09.501
You adjust the mirror.
You check the gas gauge!

37:09.585 --> 37:11.044
Brandon, that's it!

37:11.128 --> 37:12.296
What's it?

37:12.379 --> 37:14.298
It's because
of Debbie Dillman's mother.

37:14.381 --> 37:16.300
- Excuse me?
- Don't you remember?

37:16.383 --> 37:18.927
We were in the back seat
when she rammed into that tree,

37:19.011 --> 37:21.179
and we couldn't go over and play
at Debbie's all summer long

37:21.263 --> 37:23.348
because her mother was in a body cast.

37:23.432 --> 37:26.893
That's why I'm great at everything I do
but driving.

37:27.185 --> 37:30.147
Brenda, that was 11 years ago.

37:30.814 --> 37:32.274
Get over it.

37:35.026 --> 37:36.570
Hey, Brandon.

37:38.447 --> 37:42.159
I'm sorry. I know how much
making the team means to you.

37:42.701 --> 37:43.994
Well, to tell you the truth, Brenda,

37:44.077 --> 37:47.122
I got a lot of things
on my mind right now.

37:47.414 --> 37:49.124
A lot of things.

38:24.409 --> 38:27.287
Hey, you mind if I shoot a round
with you?

38:28.955 --> 38:30.790
It's a free country.

39:05.116 --> 39:08.119
I thought the gym would be empty
this early.

39:10.496 --> 39:12.039
It usually is.

39:15.668 --> 39:17.628
You have a nice touch.

39:19.547 --> 39:20.798
Thanks.

39:25.302 --> 39:28.681
Listen, I thought a lot
about what was said last night,

39:28.764 --> 39:31.600
and I can't pretend that
in my mind you weren't guilty,

39:31.684 --> 39:33.811
not because you're black,

39:33.936 --> 39:37.231
but so I'd have a better shot
at making the team.

39:37.565 --> 39:39.650
I mean, growing up in Minnesota,

39:39.733 --> 39:43.195
racial relations just wasn't something
I thought about

39:43.279 --> 39:45.531
or had to deal with so much.

39:48.659 --> 39:50.536
Hey, I got news for you.

39:50.619 --> 39:53.872
There aren't too many cowboys riding
herd in downtown Inglewood, either.

39:53.956 --> 39:55.999
Yeah, but that's just it.

39:56.125 --> 39:59.294
I'm not a cowboy
and you're not a gangbanger crackhead.

39:59.378 --> 40:01.713
We're just two guys
from the same school

40:01.797 --> 40:04.800
battling for the same spot
on the same team.

40:09.680 --> 40:13.767
Coach Reilly's probably only
going to take one of us, you know.

40:16.687 --> 40:19.064
Well, the smart money's on you.

40:19.648 --> 40:22.985
Not necessarily.
Not the way you play defense.

40:24.695 --> 40:26.822
You want to go one-on-one?

40:27.447 --> 40:29.199
Yeah, sure.

40:35.455 --> 40:39.418
Brandon, you didn't have to apologize
for wanting this as bad as I do.

40:39.501 --> 40:40.752
I know.

40:41.711 --> 40:43.380
You take it out.

40:56.434 --> 40:58.103
Brenda, you're early.

40:58.186 --> 41:01.815
I need to talk to you about
driver's training experience, Mr Karton.

41:01.898 --> 41:03.858
When I struck Henry Winkler
the other day,

41:03.942 --> 41:06.111
it struck me that maybe emotionally

41:06.194 --> 41:08.613
I'm incapable of ever learning
how to drive.

41:08.697 --> 41:13.827
Brenda, a new driver is only
as good as his, or her, instructor.

41:15.078 --> 41:17.622
- You really think so?
- Absolutely.

41:17.997 --> 41:20.208
And I assure you
it is only a matter of time

41:20.291 --> 41:25.171
before you find a different teacher
with great reflexes

41:25.588 --> 41:27.715
and a profound death wish.

41:28.675 --> 41:31.594
So, you think that
I should drop the course, huh?

41:31.678 --> 41:36.724
Or consider some alternative form
of transportation, like walking.

41:38.309 --> 41:42.313
How about instead we walk over
to the driver's training parking lot

41:42.397 --> 41:44.941
and give those reflexes a workout?

41:51.864 --> 41:53.991
Miss Yamado finally got
my laser-phaser to work.

41:54.075 --> 41:55.743
Yeah? What'd she do?

41:55.827 --> 41:58.996
She plugged it in. I'm not too mortified.

42:00.039 --> 42:02.166
What do you mean,
"Trust me, there's no story there"?

42:02.250 --> 42:04.210
What did James say
when you confronted him?

42:04.293 --> 42:07.964
He said I shouldn't be afraid
to pop from the perimeter.

42:16.931 --> 42:18.516
Hey, Minnesota.

42:18.683 --> 42:20.101
Hey, Andy.

42:24.313 --> 42:26.315
Don't let those suckers intimidate you,
Brandon.

42:26.399 --> 42:28.692
This is our school, not theirs.

42:28.776 --> 42:30.861
Only in your mind, Steve.

42:57.054 --> 42:59.973
An outdoor barbecue in October.
I love it.

43:00.140 --> 43:03.185
- You want chicken or steak?
- Whatever's easy.

43:05.771 --> 43:07.272
You were on the road
early this morning.

43:07.356 --> 43:09.316
Yeah, I couldn't sleep much last night.

43:09.399 --> 43:10.609
How'd it go?

43:10.692 --> 43:14.530
Well, it came down to me
and this guy named James. Good guy.

43:14.613 --> 43:17.741
Anyway, the Coach thinks I could use
a year on the B team under my belt.

43:17.825 --> 43:19.785
All right. Makes sense.

43:20.869 --> 43:22.412
I'm sorry, Dad.

43:22.829 --> 43:24.081
What for?

43:24.206 --> 43:27.042
Getting some quality playing time
is much better than riding the bench.

43:27.125 --> 43:29.002
Yeah, but it's not like nailing a shot
at the buzzer

43:29.086 --> 43:31.713
in front of the whole school.

43:31.797 --> 43:35.384
Brandon, the shot I made
to beat Franklin was a fluke.

43:36.343 --> 43:38.178
It was a glorious fluke.

43:38.428 --> 43:40.180
But the only reason Coach Yoring
put me in was

43:40.263 --> 43:42.974
because everyone else
had already fouled out.

43:43.058 --> 43:46.853
It was either that or we would've had
to forfeit the game.

43:48.313 --> 43:51.066
So much for your old man's glory days.

43:58.657 --> 44:02.535
Yeah, well, you still have
a fairly decent shot

44:03.912 --> 44:05.497
for a dinosaur.

44:06.414 --> 44:09.668
This dinosaur is going
to kick your butt in Horse.

44:10.794 --> 44:13.254
- Two out of three.
- I'm up for it.

44:14.964 --> 44:16.841
<i>Brandon, it's Mondale!</i>

44:17.342 --> 44:19.511
I never thought I'd see this puppy again.

44:19.594 --> 44:20.678
Neither did I.

44:20.762 --> 44:22.722
I am so happy, you don't know.

44:22.806 --> 44:25.016
It's the screwiest thing.
Seems one of our trucks towed it over

44:25.100 --> 44:27.018
to the impound lot last night.

44:27.102 --> 44:29.562
Well, the important thing is
that it's back and in one piece

44:29.646 --> 44:30.855
and everything's great.

44:30.939 --> 44:33.691
Well, you're just lucky
the perps weren't Phi Beta Kappa.

44:33.775 --> 44:36.319
They abandoned the car
right in the middle of the intersection.

44:36.402 --> 44:37.779
It takes all kinds.

44:37.862 --> 44:40.365
Even left the keys right in the ignition.

44:40.448 --> 44:42.992
Brenda, isn't that your key chain?

44:43.305 --> 44:49.334
