My baby!

00:25.320 --> 00:28.847
[sobbing]:
My only baby! No!

00:30.850 --> 00:34.069
[distant airplane rumbling,
woman wailing]

00:42.210 --> 00:44.121
Okay, just because Grandma Linda
is coming here

00:44.170 --> 00:45.774
doesn't mean
I'm not gonna need your help.

00:45.820 --> 00:47.993
All right?
There's practice with Mikey,

00:48.040 --> 00:50.383
there's picking him up,
taking him to practice.

00:50.440 --> 00:53.261
You know, there's a lot
of stuff that I need you
to cover while I'm away

00:53.310 --> 00:55.005
in the Philippines--
and you're not listening to me.

00:55.050 --> 00:56.005
You're on your phone again.

00:56.050 --> 00:57.039
Iam.

00:57.100 --> 00:58.397
Grandma and... Phil somebody.

00:58.440 --> 01:00.089
Phil? No, Philippines.

01:00.140 --> 01:01.186
It's where I'm
being deployed, Emma.

01:01.230 --> 01:02.265
Hello. Put that...Oh, my God.

01:02.320 --> 01:04.185
I got in.Got in what?

01:04.230 --> 01:05.572
Tisch.Where's Tisch?

01:05.630 --> 01:07.188
New York. It's an art school.

01:07.240 --> 01:08.446
Tisch is an art school?

01:08.500 --> 01:10.058
You applied to an art school?Yes.

01:10.110 --> 01:11.759
I told you.

01:13.110 --> 01:16.068
What, and they tell you
that you got in through e-mail?

01:16.110 --> 01:18.374
That's how they all do it, Dad.What do you mean?

01:18.420 --> 01:20.376
This is preliminary, to make
sure I'm still interested.

01:22.160 --> 01:24.503
And I'm interested.

01:24.560 --> 01:28.337
Okay. Do they have
history and math?

01:28.390 --> 01:29.516
No.

01:29.560 --> 01:31.209
Then it's not a school.

01:31.260 --> 01:33.387
You don't want me to go.No, I don't.

01:33.440 --> 01:35.340
Do they have a football team?
It's not a school.

01:35.390 --> 01:37.210
I can't believe you.Can't believe me.

01:37.270 --> 01:38.521
What? Art's not a job.

01:38.570 --> 01:40.128
It can be.I thought
you said that

01:40.180 --> 01:41.659
you were gonna apply
to a school around here,

01:41.710 --> 01:43.610
like a normal college.It's my decision.

01:43.660 --> 01:45.389
And what about Mikey?He's here with you.

01:45.450 --> 01:47.054
I'm not here all the time.

01:47.100 --> 01:48.704
I'm not his mom.

01:48.760 --> 01:50.148
Wow.

01:50.190 --> 01:52.317
Thanks for being proud
of me, Dad.

01:53.370 --> 01:54.621
Bye.

01:54.670 --> 01:56.456
That went well.

01:56.500 --> 01:59.321
That went really well.

02:00.380 --> 02:02.245
You avoiding me, Davis?

02:02.290 --> 02:04.941
No.No? I'll tell you what,

02:04.990 --> 02:07.550
the upside to almost dying
in a torpedo tube

02:07.600 --> 02:09.727
is I got a lot time to...

02:09.780 --> 02:11.338
dwell on my mistakes.

02:11.390 --> 02:15.565
And I realized that how
I reacted to the OCS news

02:15.610 --> 02:18.340
probably wasn't one
of my finest moments.

02:18.390 --> 02:20.438
Hell, I should've
just been happy for you.

02:20.480 --> 02:24.041
So, I lived, and I wanted
to tell you that, uh,

02:24.100 --> 02:25.829
I'm happy for you.Sonny.

02:25.880 --> 02:28.223
Yeah?When it looked like
you weren't gonna make It,

02:28.270 --> 02:30.318
none of that stuff
even mattered.

02:30.360 --> 02:32.578
I was just thinking about you.

02:32.630 --> 02:35.019
Oh, yeah?

02:35.060 --> 02:37.233
I have that effect on people.

02:37.280 --> 02:39.066
We're playing with fire.

02:39.110 --> 02:41.066
I'd much rather play
with ﬁre than water

02:41.110 --> 02:42.589
at this point of my career.

02:42.640 --> 02:44.801
[chuckles]
Aw, come on, Davis.

02:44.860 --> 02:46.373
Eh, with the whole...

02:46.420 --> 02:49.241
OCS thing, you know, um,
our jobs really aren't...

02:49.290 --> 02:50.848
Sonny, I'm not even talking
about the rules.

02:52.690 --> 02:54.385
Neither of us have
a good track record

02:54.430 --> 02:56.204
with making a relationship work.

02:56.260 --> 02:58.296
That is true.

02:58.350 --> 03:01.649
Who's to say we're not
the exception, though?

03:01.700 --> 03:04.601
You really believe that?

03:06.790 --> 03:09.224
I don't know.
I don't know.

03:09.270 --> 03:11.579
Neither do I, so...

03:13.410 --> 03:16.789
But losing our friendship
isn't worth the risk.

03:25.290 --> 03:28.020
[sighing]

03:28.070 --> 03:30.538
[door closes]NAIMA:
Hey, do me a favor.

03:30.600 --> 03:33.239
Hmm?If you're gonna play
late-night Bobby Flay,

03:33.300 --> 03:35.029
clean up after yourself.

03:35.080 --> 03:36.422
What?

03:36.470 --> 03:38.256
The mess you left
in the kitchen.

03:38.300 --> 03:40.256
What mess?

03:40.300 --> 03:42.768
Oh.
Do I need to add
sleep-cooking

03:42.830 --> 03:44.343
to my list of worries?

03:44.390 --> 03:46.210
Immw.
I woke up at, like,

03:46.260 --> 03:48.524
2:00 in the morning
craving cheeseburgers and...

03:48.570 --> 03:50.265
decided to make it a reality.

03:50.310 --> 03:51.390
I'm-I'm sorry, baby.

03:51.440 --> 03:53.351
Lovely. Aanay,

03:53.400 --> 03:55.527
clean the grease off the back
of the stove, would you?

03:55.580 --> 03:57.969
Yes, ma'am.

03:58.020 --> 03:59.442
[sighs]

04:11.770 --> 04:13.590
Are you having trouble sleeping?

04:13.640 --> 04:15.289
No. No, I was out cold.

04:15.340 --> 04:17.296
Ijust got hungry, is all.
[sniffs]

04:17.340 --> 04:19.900
Pastor Mel
called again.
Did he?

04:19.950 --> 04:22.032
About scheduling
Junior's baptism.

04:22.080 --> 04:23.513
Yeah, well...

04:23.560 --> 04:25.551
I'll call him today.

04:26.700 --> 04:28.645
If something's
wrong, Ray...

04:28.700 --> 04:30.179
I'm good, babe.

04:30.220 --> 04:32.268
All right? Nothing's wrong.

04:32.310 --> 04:33.698
Okay?

04:33.750 --> 04:35.308
Okay.

04:35.360 --> 04:37.089
Hey.

04:37.140 --> 04:40.485
I ever tell you how good
you look in these scrubs?

04:40.540 --> 04:43.008
I mean, like,
really good.
Mm-hmm.

04:44.540 --> 04:47.179
Have a good day
at work, okay?

04:47.240 --> 04:49.674
I'll-I'll clean... my mess.

04:55.550 --> 04:57.336
[door closes]

05:02.600 --> 05:04.386
[takes deep breath]

05:05.560 --> 05:07.289
STELLA:
Hey.

05:09.910 --> 05:11.389
Hey.

05:11.440 --> 05:13.396
What are you doing
down here?

05:13.440 --> 05:15.340
I have an interview
at Old Dominion.

05:15.400 --> 05:17.960
[chuckles]:
I miss the raspberry scones.

05:18.010 --> 05:19.659
Figured I'd stop by.

05:19.710 --> 05:23.874
Yeah, they always have
your order ready for me
every morning.

05:23.930 --> 05:26.228
I don't have the heart
to tell 'em.

05:26.280 --> 05:28.407
Plus, the scones are
actually really good.[laughs]

05:28.450 --> 05:30.236
[chuckles]:
So...They are.

05:30.280 --> 05:31.884
how have you been?

05:31.940 --> 05:34.238
I'm fine,

05:34.290 --> 05:35.769
I guess.

05:35.810 --> 05:38.324
Actually, I've been
meaning to talk to you.

05:38.380 --> 05:39.768
I wanted to...

05:39.810 --> 05:42.028
apologize for
the way...

05:42.080 --> 05:43.422
It's okay, so...

05:43.470 --> 05:45.506
It's not.

05:45.560 --> 05:48.905
At the airport, right before
you left for deployment.

05:48.950 --> 05:51.077
I-I hate myself
for doing that.

05:52.650 --> 05:56.086
You didn't want to, you know?
I-I pulled it out of you.

05:56.130 --> 05:58.735
I've always had the power
of persuasion over you.

06:00.440 --> 06:03.307
Yes, that you did.

06:03.360 --> 06:04.918
Look, it...

06:04.970 --> 06:08.007
it sucked, you know,
it did, but...

06:08.060 --> 06:10.403
I understand that this world
isn't for you, okay?

06:10.450 --> 06:12.668
You didn't want
to ask me to choose.No.

06:12.720 --> 06:14.494
I would never do that.

06:14.540 --> 06:15.973
Thank you.

06:17.240 --> 06:20.152
Because I may have chosen you.

06:21.940 --> 06:23.669
Really?

06:23.730 --> 06:26.244
Then, yeah.

06:27.560 --> 06:29.369
But now...

06:29.430 --> 06:33.946
You know, the last few weeks
I've gained some perspective.

06:34.000 --> 06:36.252
We recently almost lost Sonny.

06:36.300 --> 06:37.699
What?H-He's fine.

06:37.740 --> 06:38.866
But, yeah,

06:38.920 --> 06:40.433
he said something
that really hit me.

06:40.480 --> 06:42.698
He said that the teams are
the greatest thing In his lIfe.

06:42.750 --> 06:45.480
And I knew then
that the same was for me.

06:45.530 --> 06:48.829
You know, I'm never
gonna leave this life.

06:50.100 --> 06:52.568
It's funny that you knew that
before I did.

06:52.620 --> 06:55.441
Mm-hmm, yeah. It's funny.

06:55.500 --> 06:58.879
How I knew you.

07:01.110 --> 07:03.362
[phone vibrating]

07:03.420 --> 07:05.456
I know the drill.

07:05.510 --> 07:07.114
You should go.

07:08.380 --> 07:10.723
It was good seeing you.

07:10.770 --> 07:13.238
It was good seeing you.

07:19.390 --> 07:22.211
Clay... be careful.

07:24.130 --> 07:26.348
You know me.

07:30.310 --> 07:32.187
[door opens, bell jingles]

07:36.630 --> 07:38.052
New target package.

07:38.100 --> 07:40.148
[sighs]
You'll want to
take a look.

07:41.330 --> 07:43.548
Democratic Republic
of the Congo?

07:43.590 --> 07:45.717
American philanthropist
Damian Gilmore

07:45.760 --> 07:47.500
wanted to spend some of
his Silicon Valley fortune

07:47.550 --> 07:50.326
building a new hospital
outside of Kinshasa.

07:50.380 --> 07:53.201
Caught the attention
of this man-- Ronan Benga.

07:53.250 --> 07:55.946
Self-proclaimed "Eternal King"
of the region.Let me guess--

07:55.990 --> 07:58.777
the Eternal King took issue
with Gilmore's plans.Evidently.

07:58.820 --> 08:00.731
Gilmore and his security guards

08:00.780 --> 08:03.601
were found brutally executed
outside the hospital site.

08:03.650 --> 08:04.992
[sighs]
All right.

08:05.040 --> 08:07.656
How do we figure into this?Congolese military

08:07.700 --> 08:09.213
has intel on Benga's
whereabouts.

08:09.270 --> 08:11.659
State Department
wants him renditioned.

08:11.700 --> 08:14.396
General Trask,
AFRICOM commander,

08:14.450 --> 08:16.395
is standing by for
the warning order.

08:16.450 --> 08:18.406
So how do they know
Benga killed Gilmore?

08:18.450 --> 08:19.610
His feet.

08:19.670 --> 08:20.750
Gone.

08:20.800 --> 08:22.620
Exactly.

08:22.670 --> 08:25.628
After Benga kills his enemies,
he chops off their feet,

08:25.670 --> 08:28.673
for protection--
if they meet again
in the afterlife,

08:28.720 --> 08:30.506
they won't be able to catch him.

08:32.550 --> 08:34.768
Ghosts may not be able
to catch Benga,

08:34.810 --> 08:36.766
but Bravo Team sure as hell can.

08:53.180 --> 08:54.568
Isn't that
General What's-His-Name?

08:54.620 --> 08:55.962
RAY:
Uh, General Trask.

08:56.010 --> 08:58.228
Four-star running AFRICOM.Africa, huh?

08:58.270 --> 09:01.091
Well, I got 20 bucks
that this is pirates.

09:01.140 --> 09:02.402
I'll take that action.

09:02.450 --> 09:03.621
I'll bet you will.

09:03.670 --> 09:05.490
All right, listen up.
We have General Trask

09:05.540 --> 09:08.589
joining us from Camp Lemonnier
in Djibouti.

09:08.630 --> 09:10.325
Let's try not to waste his time.

09:10.370 --> 09:11.416
Meet our target--

09:11.460 --> 09:12.495
Ronan Benga,

09:12.550 --> 09:14.541
head of a rebel militia group

09:14.590 --> 09:16.581
in the Democratic Republic
of the Congo...

09:16.640 --> 09:19.370
"God's Freedom Warriors."

09:19.420 --> 09:20.944
[whispers]: Boom.Come on, man.

09:20.990 --> 09:22.503
Pay up.Those warlords

09:22.560 --> 09:24.164
get me every time.There it is.

09:24.210 --> 09:26.292
There you go.
Just kidding.MANDY: Two days ago,

09:26.340 --> 09:28.296
Benga massacred a group of men

09:28.350 --> 09:30.773
hoping to build
a cancer treatment center

09:30.830 --> 09:33.515
in the Congo Basin.Oh, so the leader
of God's Warriors

09:33.570 --> 09:35.868
is pro-cancer, huh?Damian Gilmore,

09:35.920 --> 09:37.876
one of the men
who funded the hospital,

09:37.920 --> 09:40.002
was one of those butchered
by Benga.

09:40.050 --> 09:43.793
Several American surgeons
were also among his victims.

09:43.840 --> 09:45.876
This is the third time
in a month

09:45.930 --> 09:47.579
that Benga has led attacks
against Americans.

09:47.630 --> 09:49.621
Now we have a reason
to go after hIm.

09:49.670 --> 09:50.921
But we need to be quiet.

09:50.980 --> 09:52.459
Congolese government
has no interest

09:52.500 --> 09:53.717
in letting their people know

09:53.760 --> 09:55.625
they're working
with the Americans.

09:55.680 --> 09:58.501
This operation has to have
zero footprint. Am I clear?

09:58.550 --> 09:59.630
Mm-hmm.
Yes, srr.

09:59.680 --> 10:00.988
Clear.

10:01.030 --> 10:02.759
Benga is best known
as an acolyte

10:02.810 --> 10:04.949
of one of the most notorious
Congolese warlords

10:04.990 --> 10:06.810
of the last 30 years:

10:06.860 --> 10:08.646
Gadiel Kande.

10:10.560 --> 10:12.994
"Torturer General."
All right, he's been, uh,

10:13.040 --> 10:14.826
involved in genocide
for decades, right?

10:14.870 --> 10:16.599
And built an army

10:16.650 --> 10:19.471
of psychologically scarred,
drug-addicted child soldiers

10:19.530 --> 10:20.827
along the way.

10:20.880 --> 10:22.222
One of whom was Benga.

10:22.270 --> 10:25.569
By-product
of a horrific cycle of violence.

10:25.620 --> 10:27.178
Kids never have a chance
to just be kids.

10:27.230 --> 10:28.925
Can you imagine becoming
the thing you hate most

10:28.970 --> 10:29.959
or be killed for it?

10:31.150 --> 10:33.311
Kande died
in a drone strike last year,

10:33.370 --> 10:36.362
but his tactics and his legacy
live on through Benga.

10:36.410 --> 10:38.799
JASON: Well, look, with all
due respect, General Trask,

10:38.850 --> 10:40.932
with intel on_ this
guy's location,

10:40.980 --> 10:43.323
why don't you just go after him
like you went after Kande?

10:43.380 --> 10:44.768
I mean, why do you need us?

10:44.810 --> 10:47.370
The drone strike on Kande
was a success,

10:47.420 --> 10:49.206
but in a country
as anti-American as this,

10:49.250 --> 10:50.979
the optics were less than ideal.

10:51.040 --> 10:53.679
So Benga has
to be handled quietly.

10:53.740 --> 10:55.776
[whispers]:
Quietly."

10:55.820 --> 10:58.209
We'll go over the specifics
of the mission on the way.

10:58.260 --> 11:00.694
We're wheels up
in two hours.

11:00.740 --> 11:01.957
Let's go.

11:05.140 --> 11:07.654
_MANDY:
Based on Intelligence reports,

11:07.710 --> 11:10.224
General Trask
has pinpointed Benga's location

11:10.270 --> 11:11.612
deep in the savanna

11:11.670 --> 11:12.830
near the Kouilou River.

11:12.880 --> 11:14.620
Is there any crazy
wildlife in those parts?

11:14.670 --> 11:16.228
Yeah, they got
jumping two-foot spider.

11:16.280 --> 11:18.009
A what?What's the name of it?

11:18.060 --> 11:19.197
The Kouilou spider.

11:19.240 --> 11:20.400
You're not serious
right now, are you?

11:20.460 --> 11:22.325
All right. So, what's the plan?

11:22.370 --> 11:24.065
We hit his house?
ERIC:
No.

11:24.110 --> 11:26.249
Can't have anything too kinetic
in a populated area.

11:26.290 --> 11:28.246
He's more vulnerable
on the move.

11:28.290 --> 11:30.246
_ Vehicle interdiction
IS the smart play here.

11:30.290 --> 11:31.723
I like it. That's a great call.

11:31.770 --> 11:33.726
Get him out in the open,
away from the eyes and the ears.

11:33.780 --> 11:36.078
According to the intel report,
Benga likes to travel

11:36.130 --> 11:38.075
with a two-vehicle convoy
through this area.

11:38.130 --> 11:39.552
Ambush vehicle.

11:39.610 --> 11:41.259
All right, so we can set up here
and wait for the convoy.

11:41.300 --> 11:42.858
They're not gonna be expecting
anything.

11:42.910 --> 11:45.049
No, not in a country where Benga
commands so much power, no.

11:45.090 --> 11:47.433
I'll get the indig vehicles
ready on the ground.

11:47.480 --> 11:49.357
All right. Nine hours
till we land.

11:49.400 --> 11:51.391
Y'all know what to do.
Let's get some rest.

11:53.320 --> 11:54.878
Hey, Jace.

11:54.930 --> 11:56.659
Yeah.Hey, hold up.

11:56.710 --> 11:58.439
Yeah, yeah.

11:58.500 --> 12:01.139
Hey, look, man, I'm sorry.
I-I've been meaning to stop by.

12:01.190 --> 12:02.532
How are the... how are the kids?

12:02.590 --> 12:04.399
The kids.
Uh, Emma got into Tisch.

12:04.460 --> 12:08.362
Wow. Really? I mean,
that's great for her, right?

12:08.420 --> 12:10.149
It's an art school, Ray.

12:10.200 --> 12:11.986
Yeah, I know.What are you gonna
do in art school?

12:12.030 --> 12:13.247
Like, what, they don't...
There's no history,

12:13.290 --> 12:14.848
there's no math. I
mean, come on, It's...

12:14.900 --> 12:16.549
it's in New York City. Know
how far that is away from us?

12:16.600 --> 12:18.033
I thought she was gonna
be somewhere local.

12:18.080 --> 12:20.207
You know, she could stay at
home, take care of Mikey.

12:20.260 --> 12:22.820
But that's not
happening probably.

12:22.870 --> 12:24.861
I'm sorry, but am I...
am I being unreasonable?

12:24.910 --> 12:26.036
Maybe.
Maybe?

12:26.090 --> 12:28.251
Yeah, maybe.
You know what, what do I know?

12:28.310 --> 12:30.608
[sighs]I'm concerned about diapers.

12:30.660 --> 12:33.527
You're concerned
about Emma leavmg.

12:33.570 --> 12:35.481
But what I do know, brother,

12:35.530 --> 12:38.226
is that she's gonna be good
'cause she's your daughter.

13:00.380 --> 13:02.336
Havoc, this is 1.
Passing Saban.

13:02.390 --> 13:04.381
Copy, Bravo 1. Passing Saban.

13:09.520 --> 13:10.600
Attention on deck.

13:13.400 --> 13:14.435
Carry on.

13:14.480 --> 13:16.391
TRASK:
Everyone, this is General Sunda

13:16.440 --> 13:17.520
of the Congolese Army.

13:17.570 --> 13:19.356
He'll be overseeing
the operation.

13:19.400 --> 13:22.449
Sir, I've got
the target vehicle on ISR.

13:24.230 --> 13:27.358
ERIC:
All right. Range Rover's
running security.

13:27.410 --> 13:29.014
Mercedes is the limo.

13:29.060 --> 13:31.369
Doesn't mean he's in the lead,
but it's likely.

13:31.410 --> 13:33.366
I don't want to assume anything
in this operation.

13:33.420 --> 13:35.547
We get one chance at this guy.

13:35.590 --> 13:37.854
Sir, I'm seeing something.
Take a look at this.

13:40.600 --> 13:42.374
SUNDA:
Benga's a cigar smoker.

13:42.430 --> 13:43.294
Benga's in the lead vehicle.

13:45.600 --> 13:48.125
ERIC:
Yeah. Bravo 1, be advised.

13:48.170 --> 13:49.728
Benga's in the lead vehicle,

13:49.780 --> 13:50.997
and they are coming in hot.

13:51.040 --> 13:52.439
Let's go. Let's take 'em out

13:52.480 --> 13:54.175
before they know what hit 'em.

14:09.540 --> 14:11.235
So much for plan "A."

14:11.280 --> 14:13.498
[shouting]

14:13.540 --> 14:15.883
Bravo 5, split left,
take out the follow car.

14:15.940 --> 14:18.192
BROCK:
Copy that.

14:30.430 --> 14:31.909
Boss, they're bugging out.
You want us to circle back?

14:31.950 --> 14:33.076
JASON:
Negative. Stay with Benga.

14:39.960 --> 14:41.302
[firing gun]

14:52.970 --> 14:54.449
Brock, Cerberus.

14:54.500 --> 14:56.491
[Cerberus panting]Hey, buddy, time to go to work.

14:56.540 --> 14:58.531
Ready!

14:59.590 --> 15:00.670
Send him.

15:00.720 --> 15:01.709
Get him!

15:05.510 --> 15:08.070
[Benga screaming]

15:08.120 --> 15:10.202
Get the dog, get the dog,
get the...

15:12.730 --> 15:14.288
[Brock shouts command]

15:14.340 --> 15:15.682
[screams]Here, here!

15:17.690 --> 15:19.430
JASON:
Jackpot.

15:19.480 --> 15:22.472
[handcuffs click]Havoc, this is 1. Passing Bear.

15:30.450 --> 15:32.350
Be nice if there was
a new medical center around

15:32.400 --> 15:33.799
to stitch you up, huh?

15:33.840 --> 15:35.398
Oh, damn. That's right.
You bombed it.

15:35.450 --> 15:38.533
Those Americans had no idea
what they were stepping into.

15:38.580 --> 15:40.662
The forces at play here.

15:40.720 --> 15:42.938
You soldiers are
equally obIIVIous.

15:44.630 --> 15:45.892
[groans]

15:45.940 --> 15:48.500
ERIC: Bravo 1, this is
Havoc Base. Nice work.

15:48.550 --> 15:51.075
Proceed to the drop-off
at rally point 3.

15:51.120 --> 15:53.588
JASON:
Havoc, this is 1. We got
a slight medical situation.

15:53.640 --> 15:55.505
Need two minutes before
we start to move.

15:55.560 --> 15:58.427
I copy medical situation.
Tango or Sierra?

15:58.470 --> 16:00.210
It's not one of ours.

16:00.260 --> 16:01.989
Copy, 1.

16:02.040 --> 16:04.213
Transfer site's
19 klicks down the road.

16:04.260 --> 16:06.649
Hey, you stay close.
Don't want any surprises.

16:06.700 --> 16:08.600
I'll ride behind you.
Yep.

16:08.660 --> 16:10.389
You have no idea
what I can give you.

16:10.440 --> 16:11.395
Shut him up.

16:11.440 --> 16:12.873
WhoI can give you.

16:12.920 --> 16:14.091
Shut him up, Ray.

16:14.140 --> 16:16.313
Gadiel Kande. He is alive.

16:16.360 --> 16:18.089
He's not _alive. We know where
he is. He's In pieces.

16:18.150 --> 16:20.095
I will tell you
where to find him.

16:21.240 --> 16:24.198
Morning of July 1. Kiva Market.

16:24.240 --> 16:26.196
The security camera

16:26.240 --> 16:28.026
will show me and
the man I met with.

16:28.070 --> 16:29.230
Kande.

16:32.860 --> 16:35.021
If you want Kande,
you must hurry.

16:35.080 --> 16:36.945
He will soon hear
of your presence

16:36.990 --> 16:38.685
and move from his hideout.

16:39.990 --> 16:42.515
Intel says Kande was vaporized
in an air strike, boss.

16:42.560 --> 16:44.949
He's feeding us a big,
steaming pile of bull.

16:46.000 --> 16:48.434
Oddly specific bull.

16:48.480 --> 16:51.131
Havoc, this is 1.

16:54.140 --> 16:55.562
MANDY:
There's Benga.

16:55.620 --> 16:57.656
DAVIS:
Well, at least half
the story's true.

16:57.710 --> 16:59.666
My God, I think that is Kande.

16:59.710 --> 17:01.189
DAVIS:
Six months after he was killed,
which means...

17:01.230 --> 17:03.050
Yeah, it does. General Trask?

17:03.100 --> 17:05.364
Video appears to confirm
the story.

17:05.410 --> 17:07.059
What are you saying?Kande's alive.

17:07.110 --> 17:09.499
He survived _the air strike.
Benga's telling the truth.

17:09.550 --> 17:11.199
That can't be.

17:11.240 --> 17:13.060
He's right there.
That is him, sir.

17:13.110 --> 17:14.634
SUNDA:
No one can find out
that Kande survived.

17:14.680 --> 17:16.591
His followers
will be emboldened.

17:16.640 --> 17:18.335
It will further destabilize
the region.

17:18.380 --> 17:20.371
He must be dealt with.

17:22.300 --> 17:24.074
Our team still has Benga.

17:24.130 --> 17:25.904
Could be our only way.

17:26.950 --> 17:28.554
I want that son of a bitch

17:28.610 --> 17:30.475
to tell us everything
he knows. Now.

17:30.520 --> 17:31.691
Hey. You got two minutes

17:31.740 --> 17:33.389
to tell me everything
you know about Kande.

17:33.440 --> 17:34.657
Go.And what do I get?

17:34.700 --> 17:37.134
That's not my department.

17:37.180 --> 17:38.875
You understand, the
man I'm handing you,

17:38.920 --> 17:41.354
he's the one that ordered
those Americans killed.

17:41.400 --> 17:43.356
And the journalists
last month.

17:43.410 --> 17:46.755
And the unpleasantness
at that girls' school.

17:46.800 --> 17:49.530
As a dead man, Kande is
more powerful than ever.

17:49.590 --> 17:53.367
Such a figure
demands a high price.

17:53.420 --> 17:56.548
Why the hell is he wagging
his jaw talking so much?

17:56.590 --> 17:59.150
Yeah, it is
a lot of talk, Sonny.

17:59.200 --> 18:01.020
It's a lot of talk.

18:01.080 --> 18:03.810
Until it leads us
to where Kande is.

18:05.640 --> 18:08.120
ERIC:
Kande's alleged address

18:08.170 --> 18:09.512
is in the Funa district

18:09.560 --> 18:10.686
of Kinshasa. Right here.

18:10.740 --> 18:12.082
Densely populated area

18:12.130 --> 18:13.609
in a highly fractured part
of the country.

18:13.650 --> 18:15.129
SUNDA:
It makes sense he
would hide there.

18:15.180 --> 18:17.125
Our soldiers
seldom venture into the area

18:17.180 --> 18:18.659
for fear of fueling unrest.

18:18.700 --> 18:21.612
All right, so you have no assets
in the area, General?

18:21.660 --> 18:23.218
Mm.

18:23.270 --> 18:25.135
ERIC:
All right.

18:25.190 --> 18:27.055
So, Bravo team can wait
until nightfall.

18:27.100 --> 18:29.705
Set up a reconnaissance
in an urban hide.

18:29.760 --> 18:31.660
We can have two of our men

18:31.710 --> 18:33.405
transport Benga
to the black site

18:33.460 --> 18:35.143
while the rest of the team

18:35.200 --> 18:37.498
picks up their gear and moves
towards the target address.

18:37.550 --> 18:40.633
We cannot have American soldiers
openly assaulting.

18:40.680 --> 18:42.113
Understood, General.

18:42.160 --> 18:45.152
_ Bravo team will act in a _
discreet observational capaCIty.

18:45.210 --> 18:47.110
Davis, find me an
adjacent building

18:47.160 --> 18:48.718
where the team can set
up an observation post.

18:48.770 --> 18:49.907
Roger that.

18:49.950 --> 18:50.848
SUNDA:
If your men
catch sight of Kande,

18:50.910 --> 18:54.255
I will order an air strike.

19:05.230 --> 19:07.790
That's the target address
right there.

19:07.840 --> 19:11.355
I wish he'd come out and fetch
his copy of Warlord Monthly.

19:11.410 --> 19:13.708
Make it real quick for us.

19:18.460 --> 19:20.189
Building straight ahead's
been confirmed vacant

19:20.240 --> 19:21.844
for our OP.JASON: Copy that.

19:21.890 --> 19:24.586
Let's stash the_tru_ck
and get set up lnSIde.

19:43.480 --> 19:46.210
All right. Secure the perimeter
and meet us on the second deck.

19:46.270 --> 19:48.261
Copy that.

19:50.230 --> 19:52.312
Set up those trail cams.
I got your six.

20:08.250 --> 20:10.502
Yeah, this'll work.

20:13.860 --> 20:15.555
RAY:
Building's secure.

20:15.600 --> 20:17.682
Wireless t_rai| cams are all
set up outSIde the perimeter

20:17.730 --> 20:19.379
in case anybody
tries to creep up on us.

20:19.430 --> 20:20.647
RAY:
And if Kande pokes his head out,

20:20.690 --> 20:22.385
we allowed to do more
than just look?

20:22.430 --> 20:23.772
JASON:
Strictly observe and report.

20:23.830 --> 20:25.604
Glass the structure,
document what we see.

20:25.650 --> 20:28.039
It's a high-risk
babysitting job.

20:28.090 --> 20:30.820
Mm-hmm.Benga's men that got away

20:30.880 --> 20:34.043
are probably telling everybody
that the Americans are in town.

20:34.100 --> 20:36.568
And we let 'em go.Yes, we did.

20:36.620 --> 20:39.669
But who knew
we'd be sticking around, huh?

20:39.710 --> 20:41.496
If anybody
tries to tip Kande off

20:41.540 --> 20:43.235
and he squirts off target,
then what?

20:43.280 --> 20:44.622
JASON:
Somebody else's problem.

20:44.670 --> 20:47.138
Far as I'm concerned,
we've accomplished our mission.

20:48.460 --> 20:50.451
Sonny, you're first up.

20:50.510 --> 20:51.636
Ray, you're on scope.

20:51.680 --> 20:53.409
Clay, document
everything they see.

20:53.460 --> 20:55.724
Relay it back to Havoc. Clear?Yeah.

20:55.770 --> 20:56.896
Last time I took pictures,

20:56.950 --> 20:58.759
the mission went belly-up.
Just saying.

20:58.820 --> 21:01.254
Good point. Ray?

21:01.300 --> 21:03.336
You're first up.
Sonny, you're on scope.

21:03.390 --> 21:05.210
Havoc, this is 1.

21:05.260 --> 21:06.818
We've got eyes on.

21:06.870 --> 21:09.646
Copy, 1.
Standing by for updates.

21:10.660 --> 21:12.651
[percussive music playing]

21:20.620 --> 21:23.748
SONNY: All right.
What appears to be a window

21:23.800 --> 21:25.836
with newspapers covering it.

21:27.370 --> 21:30.009
What appears to be...

21:30.070 --> 21:32.538
a can with burnt trash in it.

21:32.590 --> 21:34.194
RAY:
What appears to be a woman,

21:34.240 --> 21:35.411
20 to 30, hanging laundry

21:35.460 --> 21:37.985
outside the east side
of the property.

21:38.030 --> 21:39.634
[camera clicks]

21:39.680 --> 21:42.422
Any skiwies with what appears
to be Kande's initials in them?

21:42.470 --> 21:44.518
That's a negative.

21:45.820 --> 21:48.425
It's been a while.
Anyone getting a Vibe?

21:48.480 --> 21:51.563
CLAY: Burnt trash,
newspaper on the windows.

21:51.610 --> 21:53.783
Bin Laden's Abbottabad hideout
had all the same features.

21:53.830 --> 21:55.434
I think someone's inside.

21:55.480 --> 21:58.085
RAY: Mm-hmm.
Says paper on the windows?

21:58.140 --> 21:59.482
Come on, brother,
you know it gets

21:59.530 --> 22:00.838
a hundred degrees here
most days.

22:03.320 --> 22:05.094
Yeah, or maybe they want
to burn this trash

22:05.140 --> 22:06.311
so nobody searches it.

22:06.360 --> 22:07.440
That's possible.

22:07.500 --> 22:08.922
But if it isn't
Kande's hideout,

22:08.970 --> 22:10.585
they why did Benga
send us here, you know?

22:10.630 --> 22:13.190
Might have wanted his deal, and
he tossed us a random address.

22:13.240 --> 22:14.548
SONNY:
What appears to be

22:14.590 --> 22:16.672
the same damn jeep
that's crawled by us twice,

22:16.720 --> 22:19.371
and the driver
is eyeballing our pos.

22:19.420 --> 22:20.899
[camera clicking]

22:20.940 --> 22:22.202
Could be just
a random local.

22:22.250 --> 22:23.638
Or one of Kande's men.

22:23.690 --> 22:25.590
CLAY:
They're fighting age.

22:25.640 --> 22:27.904
If this is Kande's hideout,
he's gonna have security, right?

22:27.950 --> 22:30.384
I will Pale Rider
this happy idiot.

22:30.430 --> 22:31.909
Just say the damn word.

22:31.950 --> 22:33.508
We're here to watch.
Keep watching.

22:33.560 --> 22:35.471
SONNY:
Another possibility is

22:35.520 --> 22:37.568
Benga told us
to come to this dump

22:37.610 --> 22:39.521
so his men
would know where we are,

22:39.570 --> 22:41.561
and they could avenge
his capture.

22:41.620 --> 22:43.394
You're seeing shadows, Sonny.

22:43.440 --> 22:45.135
Maybe.

22:45.180 --> 22:47.967
Are you sure you want
to stick around and find out?

22:55.110 --> 22:56.498
I'm telling you,
this guy's a damn snitch.

22:56.540 --> 22:59.327
He had that snitchy glint
in his eye.Relax, man.

22:59.370 --> 23:00.803
We're good, okay?All right.

23:00.850 --> 23:02.374
It's all
too qUIet, man.

23:02.420 --> 23:04.376
It's like a zombie movie
just before...

23:04.420 --> 23:06.593
they start to get
their brains eaten out.

23:06.640 --> 23:08.198
Guys, we got something here.

23:08.250 --> 23:09.808
Ray.RAY: Got 'em.

23:09.860 --> 23:10.815
[camera clicking]

23:10.860 --> 23:13.420
Yeah, there it is.

23:13.470 --> 23:15.904
Havoc, this is 1.
Got two adult females

23:15.950 --> 23:17.429
leaving the target house.

23:17.480 --> 23:18.560
Sending pictures now.

23:18.610 --> 23:20.862
Copy, 1.
Receiving now. Stand by.

23:24.660 --> 23:27.481
There are no matches
In any database.

23:27.530 --> 23:29.919
If they're Kande affiliates,
they're new ones.

23:30.930 --> 23:32.488
Havoc Base to Bravo 1.

23:32.540 --> 23:35.008
No matches to Kande affiliates.

23:35.060 --> 23:37.108
Havoc out.

23:39.060 --> 23:42.496
We'll get in.
Keep at it.

23:43.550 --> 23:45.711
Sir, is that...?Target package

23:45.770 --> 23:48.466
from last year's
actions on Kande.

23:48.510 --> 23:51.070
Similar situation.

23:51.120 --> 23:53.463
I'm trying to figure out
what we did wrong.

23:53.510 --> 23:55.239
Intel was rock solid.

23:55.300 --> 23:57.768
Local assets intercepted
Kande's wife on her way

23:57.820 --> 23:59.549
to the doctor's appointment.

23:59.610 --> 24:02.215
She broke easily.
She gave us everything.

24:02.260 --> 24:04.216
_ His location was
Independently vetted?

24:04.260 --> 24:06.433
ISR confirmed he was
in the building.

24:06.480 --> 24:09.608
Air strike obliterated
the structure.

24:09.660 --> 24:12.743
Killed four women
and three children.

24:14.010 --> 24:16.058
I live with that,
Agent Ellis.

24:16.100 --> 24:19.979
I understand the difficulty
of such a call, sir.

24:20.020 --> 24:23.194
My record isn't spotless.

24:23.240 --> 24:24.753
But...

24:24.810 --> 24:28.029
hopefully, we learn
from our mistakes.

24:29.460 --> 24:32.463
The call is General Sunda's
to make, not ours.

24:41.610 --> 24:43.646
You know, boss,
even if Kande's in there,

24:43.690 --> 24:46.306
I mean, those women
could be hired help.

24:46.350 --> 24:47.658
They pull that trigger
without knowing,

24:47.700 --> 24:48.997
and innocents could die.

24:49.050 --> 24:51.211
SONNY:
Guys like Kande kill
people every day.

24:51.270 --> 24:54.091
You take him out,
you save thousands.

24:54.140 --> 24:56.927
It's a hard choice
on a hard reality.

24:56.970 --> 24:59.131
Yeah, but we don't have
a positive ID. on Kande.

24:59.190 --> 25:01.499
Which is less than what they had
when they swung and missed.

25:01.540 --> 25:04.179
CLAY: But we know
how these guys operate.

25:04.240 --> 25:05.582
All right?
They hide behind civilians.

25:05.630 --> 25:06.938
T-They use them
to save their own asses.

25:06.980 --> 25:08.493
They're a bunch of cowards.

25:08.550 --> 25:11.769
So regardless of who's in there,
you want to drop the house?

25:11.810 --> 25:14.506
Hey, everyone knows who
Kande is in this country.

25:14.550 --> 25:17.337
All right? What-what he does,
what he stands for,

25:17.380 --> 25:18.631
that he kills.

25:18.690 --> 25:20.772
If he's in there,
then those women are enablers,

25:20.820 --> 25:22.299
they're enemies.

25:22.340 --> 25:24.205
JASON:
It's not that simple.

25:24.260 --> 25:25.557
Cultural difference
gomg on here.

25:25.610 --> 25:27.646
Not sure the women here
really have a ch0Ice.

25:27.700 --> 25:29.952
SONNY:
Trail cam.

25:30.000 --> 25:31.126
We have more pressing issues,
gentlemen.

25:31.180 --> 25:34.172
Told you this guy was creeping.

25:34.220 --> 25:35.528
Sonny, Clay, check it out.

25:35.570 --> 25:37.561
Ray, you stay on scope.

25:45.500 --> 25:47.365
Get your ass in here!

25:49.540 --> 25:51.496
Sonny, scope.

25:52.980 --> 25:54.538
This guy speak English?

25:54.590 --> 25:56.899
Yeah.Gadiel Kande-- he send you?

25:56.940 --> 25:59.329
Kande's dead.Who sent you?

25:59.380 --> 26:00.677
No one.Okay.

26:00.730 --> 26:02.504
What were you doing here?

26:02.560 --> 26:04.642
I'm... I was scavenging.

26:04.690 --> 26:06.032
Scavenging what?Copper wire.

26:06.080 --> 26:08.253
Copper wire.I thought this was
an empty building.

26:08.300 --> 26:10.086
Then why'd you circle it
three times, chief?

26:10.130 --> 26:11.210
What?
JASON:
Kande--

26:11.260 --> 26:12.648
is he in that house
across the street?

26:12.700 --> 26:14.736
I-I don't know. I swear.

26:14.790 --> 26:16.269
You got anything?

26:16.310 --> 26:18.562
It's all a local dialect.
Kiswahili. I don't know it.

26:18.620 --> 26:20.520
_But there's a contact
In here named Benga.

26:20.570 --> 26:22.265
RAY:
Benga's a common name
in these parts.

26:22.310 --> 26:23.834
And Benga and Kande,
they would've used

26:23.880 --> 26:25.529
code names, anyway.

26:25.580 --> 26:27.093
These text messages,
what do they say?

26:27.150 --> 26:29.539
This is with my sister.

26:29.580 --> 26:31.719
Planning my mother's
birthday! Please!SONNY: Hey, Ray,

26:31.760 --> 26:32.920
Ray, you got to get this.

26:37.900 --> 26:39.231

26:39.290 --> 26:40.541
She turned.
We get it?

26:40.590 --> 26:42.763
JASON:
It's a blurred image.

26:46.120 --> 26:47.678
Havoc, this is 1.

26:47.730 --> 26:49.641
I've got a bad image
of a fourth female

26:49.690 --> 26:51.169
entering the target building.

26:51.210 --> 26:53.292
Copy, Bravo 1.

26:53.350 --> 26:54.908
Send me a picture
of Kande's wife.

26:54.960 --> 26:56.643
Might have been her
who went inside.

26:57.610 --> 26:58.781
Yeah, stand by, Bravo 1.

26:58.830 --> 26:59.990
Do you think it could be...

27:00.050 --> 27:02.041
Nel Kande.
This is what we needed.

27:03.700 --> 27:05.349
This is
General Sunda.

27:05.400 --> 27:07.448
Dcollage immdiat.

27:07.490 --> 27:08.832
Scramble the fighter.

27:08.880 --> 27:11.667
General, this isn't proof
that Kande's there.

27:11.710 --> 27:13.405
It's not even proof
that Nel Kande is there.

27:13.450 --> 27:16.624
We know that Nel Kande lied
to protect her husband,

27:16.670 --> 27:19.230
and our intel always
placed them together.

27:19.280 --> 27:21.760
If she is in that house,
he is in that house.

27:21.810 --> 27:24.768
I'm not sure if that's enough
to warrant a strike, General.

27:24.810 --> 27:26.858
We only have the
word of a murderer

27:26.900 --> 27:29.027
a_nd_ circumstantial evidence
pomting to Kande being there.

27:29.080 --> 27:30.763
Innocent lives
are at stake.

27:30.820 --> 27:33.425
Collateral damage is always
unfortunate but unavoidable.

27:33.470 --> 27:34.778
Nel Kande's
presence

27:34.820 --> 27:36.162
is enough for me.

27:36.210 --> 27:38.690
Sir...

27:38.740 --> 27:41.698
give my men the time to
confirm it's Nel Kande

27:41.740 --> 27:44.470
before you have another
failure on your hands.

27:49.100 --> 27:50.829
My jet will not fire

27:50.880 --> 27:53.963
until your men confirm
that the woman is Nel Kande.

27:54.020 --> 27:57.842
But once they do, I will strike
and kill everyone there.

27:57.890 --> 28:00.757
It's awful,
but that is the price of war.

28:12.600 --> 28:14.374
Jace, is it her?

28:15.950 --> 28:17.724
Man.

28:17.780 --> 28:19.600
Could be her.
I... I don't know.

28:19.650 --> 28:21.698
I don't know.

28:21.740 --> 28:24.208
Tough call, brother,
but you know what I'm gonna say.

28:24.260 --> 28:27.525
What if it is her?It is her,
because Kande's here.

28:27.570 --> 28:29.697
I agree with him, boss.

28:34.930 --> 28:37.228
You know, I could go on
for hours listing air strikes

28:37.280 --> 28:38.759
that killed innocents.

28:40.450 --> 28:41.758
Strikes I called.

28:41.800 --> 28:44.587
Look, that's tough,
boss, okay?

28:44.630 --> 28:47.235
Those victims, they chose
to associate themselves
with those targets,

28:47.290 --> 28:49.975
whether it's for religious
beliefs, for social standing.

28:50.030 --> 28:52.988
They took themselves
down with their kids.

28:53.030 --> 28:55.373
Did they?

28:55.420 --> 28:56.819
I think so.

28:56.860 --> 28:58.111
SONNY:
Hey.

28:58.170 --> 29:00.638
That door's starting
to open up again.Ray.

29:00.690 --> 29:01.861
Yep.

29:01.910 --> 29:04.822
[kids shouting, laughing]JASON: Kids.

29:04.870 --> 29:06.690
At least four of them.

29:06.740 --> 29:08.822
What do you want to do, J?
Jefsinbound.

29:08.870 --> 29:09.859
I don't know.

29:09.920 --> 29:11.694
I found a text in here
in his phone

29:11.750 --> 29:13.877
that has the address
of this building in it.

29:13.920 --> 29:15.091
JEEP DRIVER:
To my wife.

29:15.140 --> 29:17.313
Saying where I was.

29:17.360 --> 29:18.315
Shut up.

29:18.360 --> 29:19.668
My ass you're updating
your wife.

29:19.710 --> 29:21.098
CLAY: This could mean
soldiers on the way.

29:21.150 --> 29:22.833
Man, we need to make
a decision fast.

29:22.890 --> 29:24.448
ERIC:
Bravo 1, this is Havoc Base.

29:24.500 --> 29:26.718
Be advised,
ISR spotted two trucks

29:26.760 --> 29:30.059
carrying armed men
towards your location.

29:30.110 --> 29:31.759
I'd suggest you exfil
while you still can.

29:41.780 --> 29:43.077
All Bravo elements, be advised,

29:43.120 --> 29:46.772
armed convoy is ten mikes
from your position.

29:46.820 --> 29:48.549
Copy that, Havoc.
We're moving out.

29:59.270 --> 30:01.090
Havoc, this is 1.

30:01.140 --> 30:03.096
Permission to assault the house.

30:04.840 --> 30:06.353
Say again, 1?

30:06.410 --> 30:08.799
Still too many unknowns here.
Getting eyes on the inside

30:08.850 --> 30:10.010
only way to confirm
Kande's presence

30:10.060 --> 30:11.197
and reduce collateral damage.

30:11.240 --> 30:13.322
Everything else
is just debatable.

30:13.370 --> 30:16.635
American troops are explicitly
not authorized to be in-country.

30:17.900 --> 30:19.322
Master Chief Hayes,

30:19.380 --> 30:21.769
I'm ordering you
to make the call on the wife,

30:21.820 --> 30:23.117
then leave the building
immediately.

30:23.160 --> 30:25.685
[exhales]

30:25.730 --> 30:27.288
Copy that. Stand by.

30:30.650 --> 30:32.868
Got no reason to think Kande's
Wife means anything, brother.

30:32.910 --> 30:35.049
Even if that is her.
She ratted him out

30:35.090 --> 30:37.217
a year ago-- why would
she still be with him?

30:39.620 --> 30:41.133
We've both been here before.

30:41.180 --> 30:43.444
I make this call and I'm wrong,

30:43.490 --> 30:45.003
we both know how
this plays out.

30:45.060 --> 30:47.005
Yes, we have, and yes, I do.

30:49.710 --> 30:51.666
But it's your call, J.

30:57.200 --> 30:59.361
Havoc, this is 1.

30:59.420 --> 31:01.934
We got eyes on the target
in question.

31:03.290 --> 31:04.507
It's not Kande's wife.

31:05.550 --> 31:07.154
Say again:

31:07.210 --> 31:10.771
it's not Kande's wife.
Call off the strikes.

31:10.820 --> 31:11.991
Copy, 1.

31:12.040 --> 31:14.167
Relaying.

31:15.220 --> 31:16.209
Let's move out.

31:19.960 --> 31:21.518
SUNDA:
That is not your unit's

31:21.570 --> 31:22.912
decision to make.

31:22.960 --> 31:24.484
I decide when to
call off the strike.

31:24.530 --> 31:25.918
All due respect, sir,

31:25.970 --> 31:27.915
our mission was
to observe and report.

31:27.970 --> 31:30.700
And the master_chief has
reported that she IS not there.

31:30.750 --> 31:33.093
After he said that she was.He said it might be her.

31:33.150 --> 31:35.402
And he has since
confirmed that it isn't.

31:35.450 --> 31:37.589
The jet is three mikes
from target.SUNDA: General Trask,

31:37.630 --> 31:40.019
please remind
your people

31:40.070 --> 31:42.322
that this is my decision.

31:42.370 --> 31:45.635
You're right, General,
it is your call.

31:45.680 --> 31:48.069
But my recommendation is
for continued observation

31:48.120 --> 31:51.021
of the target
by Congolese forces.

31:51.080 --> 31:53.071
There are too many unknowns.

32:00.780 --> 32:02.782
Call off the strike.

32:04.310 --> 32:06.175
Permission to
breathe, Sir?

32:06.220 --> 32:08.222
Permission granted.

32:19.580 --> 32:21.275
[scoffs]
No, man. I'm good.

32:21.330 --> 32:23.275
I... I had too much
the other night.

32:23.330 --> 32:26.231
I'm good.Come on. You've been
hitting it hard lately, huh?

32:26.290 --> 32:29.669
Almost getting
blown up by Jenna--

32:29.730 --> 32:32.244
that rattle you?
[sighs]

32:34.160 --> 32:36.208
No, actually, the
exact opposite.

32:36.250 --> 32:39.299
Standing next to that bomb,
I didn't feel a damn thing.

32:39.340 --> 32:41.069
That's what's
bugging me.

32:42.610 --> 32:45.215
You all right, man?
What's going on with you?

32:45.260 --> 32:46.989
Hmm?

32:47.050 --> 32:49.006
Trying to figure
that out, brother.

32:50.400 --> 32:53.870
You know, what we do,
we see so much evil.

32:53.920 --> 32:57.185
Yeah, yeah, we see it,
and put it to bed.

32:57.230 --> 32:58.959
That's what we do.
It's our job.

32:59.020 --> 33:00.965
Yeah, but it
never goes away.

33:01.020 --> 33:03.102
Another story, huh?

33:05.590 --> 33:07.808
I mean, I always had faith
that it would.

33:07.850 --> 33:10.671
You know, eventually,
that it would go away.

33:10.720 --> 33:13.416
That good would conquer evil.

33:14.940 --> 33:17.022
But maybe...

33:17.080 --> 33:20.243
maybe the reason evil
blooms in certain places is,

33:20.300 --> 33:22.643
maybe then God's not...

33:22.690 --> 33:24.908
maybe God's not there
in those places.

33:24.950 --> 33:26.906
I mean, if he was,

33:26.960 --> 33:29.121
why doesn't he do
something about it all?

33:30.220 --> 33:32.438
I don't know.

33:32.480 --> 33:34.482
Don't know.

33:37.270 --> 33:39.261
Everything has a
price, right, J?

33:39.320 --> 33:42.357
Mm-hmm, it does.

33:42.410 --> 33:44.184
[scoffs]

33:44.230 --> 33:46.232
Maybe that's what this job does.

33:47.890 --> 33:50.199
Cost of war isn't just
paid on the battlefield.

33:50.240 --> 33:52.288
I mean, it comes
home with us, right?

33:52.330 --> 33:56.118
Steals from us_--
our lives, our marriages.

33:58.070 --> 34:00.118
Maybe even our faith.

34:02.340 --> 34:04.331
Hey.

34:05.520 --> 34:07.294
You good?

34:07.340 --> 34:08.944
Yeah, I'm good.
Yeah?

34:09.000 --> 34:10.388
Are you sure?

34:10.430 --> 34:11.772
Hey, I'm just talking, man.

34:11.830 --> 34:12.956
All right, just take one.

34:13.000 --> 34:15.787
Hold on to that one
right there. Grab it.

34:18.750 --> 34:19.523
[whistles]

34:19.570 --> 34:22.004
Hey. Whoa. Hey, look at you.

34:22.060 --> 34:24.005
Bless your heart.

34:24.060 --> 34:27.188
So, another
international incident averted?

34:27.230 --> 34:30.529
Unless, uh, one of Kande's men
blows up a mall tomorrow.

34:30.590 --> 34:32.626
Then we'll be asking
the eternal question

34:32.670 --> 34:34.809
"What if?"
for the rest of our days.

34:34.850 --> 34:37.159
Yeah, but it still wouldn't
prove he was in that house.

34:37.200 --> 34:42.593
So I'm guessing, uh, you think
we made the right call,

34:42.640 --> 34:45.336
being, uh, that you're so
risk-averse and everything?

34:45.380 --> 34:48.258
Ha-ha. Okay, ha-ha.[laughing]

34:48.300 --> 34:49.779
Right, I deserved that.

34:49.820 --> 34:51.776
Uh-huh.

34:51.820 --> 34:55.563
Look, I don't want to throw
our friendship away on a whim.

34:55.610 --> 34:58.124
But...

34:58.180 --> 35:00.785
I also don't want _
to spend the rest of my lIfe

35:00.830 --> 35:03.173
wondering "What if?"

35:05.920 --> 35:08.059
Oh, okay.

35:08.100 --> 35:11.570
Uh... I'm not sure if, uh,

35:11.630 --> 35:14.098
it's the beer I'm drinking
or the sleeping pill I took.

35:14.150 --> 35:17.449
I'm not quite tracking
what you're saying.

35:17.500 --> 35:20.549
But, uh, are-are you saying
what I think you're saying?

35:23.550 --> 35:25.598
Yeah.

35:27.640 --> 35:29.596
[sighs]
Too good to resist.

35:29.640 --> 35:31.119
[laughs]
Oh, God.[laughing]

35:31.170 --> 35:32.944
See you on the ground.

35:36.830 --> 35:38.991
Stop reading
there, numnuts.

35:39.040 --> 35:41.395
Hey. Come on.[grunts]

35:41.440 --> 35:44.568
Don't know there's much
to celebrate.

35:44.620 --> 35:45.917
Look, if you
were in charge,

35:45.960 --> 35:48.781
you wouldn't have argued
against the strike?

35:48.840 --> 35:50.831
[sighs]
I don't know, boss.

35:50.880 --> 35:52.928
You know?

35:52.970 --> 35:56.053
By my math, even with 80%
certainty he was in that house,

35:56.110 --> 35:58.670
we'd likely save a lot of lives
taking that shot.

35:58.720 --> 36:00.369
Right. Would have
said the same thing

36:00.410 --> 36:02.014
if I was in
your shoes, but

36:02.070 --> 36:04.288
if I drop that ball,
and I'm wrong, ooh,

36:04.330 --> 36:06.935
there are bigger,
long-term ramifications.

36:06.990 --> 36:11.814
I mean, making a call
off of incomplete intelligence?

36:11.860 --> 36:13.725
Not worth it.

36:13.780 --> 36:15.463
Not worth it at all.

36:15.520 --> 36:19.251
Besides, Kande-- he's...
he's on the CIA list, and

36:19.300 --> 36:21.518
ifI know Mandy,
and I know Mandy,

36:21.570 --> 36:23.561
she's definitely
gonna get him.

36:26.270 --> 36:28.215
Solid point.
Yeah.

36:28.270 --> 36:30.226
Guess it's, uh...

36:30.270 --> 36:33.137
it's easy for me to call
the shots when it's theoretical.

36:33.190 --> 36:36.489
Yeah, well, one day, when
you're running your own team,

36:36.540 --> 36:38.098
you'll think of it differently.

36:39.670 --> 36:41.228
You think
I can handle my own team?

36:41.280 --> 36:43.840
Yeah, you're good,
but you're not that good... yet.

36:43.890 --> 36:45.323
Got to earn it.

36:45.370 --> 36:47.679
You don't have the experience.

36:47.720 --> 36:49.062
Thanks, boss.

36:49.110 --> 36:50.896
Yeah. One
other thing.

36:50.940 --> 36:53.113
If you tell anybody
I said that you're good,

36:53.160 --> 36:55.594
I'm gonna have to kill you.

37:16.010 --> 37:19.571
Ain't got time to shoot the
breeze, got no time to blow

37:19.620 --> 37:22.919
Excuse me, mister,
if you please

37:22.970 --> 37:24.881
I gotta go

37:24.930 --> 37:27.273
Born one mornin'
on the Day of the Dead

37:27.330 --> 37:29.230
In a bombed out bungalow

37:29.290 --> 37:34.671
My mama kissed my cheek
and said, "I gotta go"

37:34.730 --> 37:36.459
I gotta go somewhere

37:36.510 --> 37:39.024
I gotta go

37:39.080 --> 37:41.856
Wastin' time standin' here

37:41.910 --> 37:43.992
I gotta go

37:44.040 --> 37:46.679
I gotta go somewhere

37:46.740 --> 37:48.389
I gotta go

37:48.440 --> 37:53.173
Wastin' time standin' here

37:53.220 --> 37:55.688
I gotta go.

38:02.710 --> 38:07.795
There they were
against the stars

38:09.370 --> 38:14.148
Shined so bright

38:14.200 --> 38:18.159
That spring night

38:18.200 --> 38:22.762
And then it happened

38:27.870 --> 38:32.898
You wasted nothing

38:32.960 --> 38:34.689
Giving in.

38:34.740 --> 38:37.004
[piano playing]

38:40.400 --> 38:42.174
[song ends]MAN: Well done.

38:42.230 --> 38:43.743
[sighs][school bell ringing]

38:43.790 --> 38:46.577
Okay, guys,
see you tomorrow.

38:46.620 --> 38:49.794
[indistinct chatter]

38:57.420 --> 38:59.843
_ Been a while
Since I've seen you perform.

38:59.900 --> 39:01.379
Mm.

39:01.420 --> 39:03.729
Wow.

39:03.770 --> 39:06.079
Amazing.

39:06.120 --> 39:07.599
Really, it's...

39:07.640 --> 39:10.029
You sounded great.

39:10.080 --> 39:13.345
You know, I-I realized
I never really understood

39:13.390 --> 39:16.996
what, uh...
college means to you,

39:17.050 --> 39:20.133
or what it is for you. I...

39:20.180 --> 39:22.489
[sighs]

39:22.530 --> 39:25.135
It's singing, right?
I mean, you-you...

39:25.180 --> 39:26.659
Singing is your life?

39:26.710 --> 39:28.439
That's what you want to do
with your life is sing?

39:28.490 --> 39:32.017
I-I don't know, but I don't have
to have it all figured out yet.

39:32.060 --> 39:34.108
Of course you don't.And if this is
your way of saying

39:34.150 --> 39:36.459
I shouldn't go because I don't
have everything plotted out,

39:36.500 --> 39:38.274
that's completely stupid.

39:39.330 --> 39:41.104
You should go.

39:42.940 --> 39:44.373
They'd be lucky
to have you.

39:47.420 --> 39:49.376
You're okay with this?

39:49.430 --> 39:52.945
Um...

39:52.990 --> 39:55.993
Emma, this is not about me,
it's not about my life.

39:56.040 --> 39:57.644
It's about your life.

39:57.690 --> 40:00.341
I know it'll make things harder
on you and Mikey,

40:00.390 --> 40:02.346
you not having me to lean on.

40:02.400 --> 40:03.958
I could defer a year.

40:04.010 --> 40:06.171
No, you're not gonna defer.

40:08.440 --> 40:10.396
We'll be okay here.

40:12.490 --> 40:15.186
This is your call now,
your choice.

40:15.230 --> 40:19.234
You can do this,
and I'm gonna be supporting you

40:19.280 --> 40:21.271
the whole way through.

40:22.980 --> 40:25.938
Always gonna be here for you...

40:25.980 --> 40:29.416
like you were here for me.

40:29.470 --> 40:33.292
You know, when Mom died,

40:33.340 --> 40:36.070
you let me go.

40:36.120 --> 40:40.159
So I owe you one, okay?

40:40.220 --> 40:42.688
Got it?

40:42.740 --> 40:44.469
[sniffles]

40:44.520 --> 40:47.216
I love you.

40:47.270 --> 40:49.738
Okay?
