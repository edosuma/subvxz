00:05.506 --> 00:07.007
â™ª

00:09.177 --> 00:10.911
(shrieks)

00:16.184 --> 00:18.086
(school bell rings)

00:20.020 --> 00:21.155
(belches)

00:21.189 --> 00:22.190
(tires screech)

00:24.358 --> 00:26.360
D'oh!

00:26.394 --> 00:28.062
(grunts)

00:28.096 --> 00:30.231
(applause)

00:30.264 --> 00:32.166
(stammers): You sit on me.

00:32.200 --> 00:33.867
There's a remote in my crack.

00:33.901 --> 00:35.336
Uh, Problems I Have!

00:35.369 --> 00:37.171
I could use a slip cover.

00:37.205 --> 00:39.173
Um, uh,
Things Your Sister Would Say!

00:39.207 --> 00:41.008
No. Uh...
(gasps)

00:41.041 --> 00:43.344
You haven't replaced me
since 1989.

00:43.377 --> 00:45.246
Things a Couch Would Say!

00:45.279 --> 00:48.015
-Yes!
-(bell dinging)

00:48.048 --> 00:50.050
â™ª

00:55.389 --> 00:57.758
Hopefully, we won't be out
too late, Shauna.

00:57.791 --> 00:59.193
(Valley girl accent):
Whatever.

00:59.227 --> 01:00.228
And just for the night,

01:00.261 --> 01:02.029
could you lose the tongue ring?

01:02.062 --> 01:03.397
Whatever.

01:03.431 --> 01:06.267
Homer, is it too late
to change babysitters?

01:06.300 --> 01:07.401
Yes.

01:07.435 --> 01:09.036
So I'll have to stay home.

01:09.069 --> 01:11.739
I don't think we have to--
Homer.

01:11.772 --> 01:13.241
Yes, Marge?!

01:13.274 --> 01:16.944
We both have to go
to Drug Awareness Night!

01:16.977 --> 01:19.547
(sighs)
I guess we have no choice.

01:19.580 --> 01:22.082
Here's the number
for the poison control center,

01:22.116 --> 01:24.118
the allergy hotline,

01:24.152 --> 01:26.053
and, if the kids misbehave,

01:26.086 --> 01:27.888
Papa John's Pizza.

01:27.921 --> 01:29.123
Don't worry, Mrs. Simpson.

01:29.157 --> 01:31.091
We'll take great care
of your kids.

01:31.125 --> 01:32.059
"We"?

01:32.092 --> 01:33.627
Uh, me and God.

01:33.661 --> 01:34.928
Okay, then.

01:34.962 --> 01:36.964
We'll see you soon.

01:39.167 --> 01:42.069
(moaning)

01:42.102 --> 01:46.073
Want to watch videos
of pythons swallowing stuff?

01:46.106 --> 01:49.243
Uh, can't we watch something
with kittens?

01:49.277 --> 01:51.078
Oh, there's kittens in there.

01:51.111 --> 01:52.513
(kitten meows)

01:55.283 --> 01:57.251
This is pointless.

01:57.285 --> 01:59.820
We learned all the new
dangerous drugs last year:

01:59.853 --> 02:02.590
sprack, zup, borzo,
and crystal bam.

02:02.623 --> 02:05.125
I hear
they're mixing bam with zup.

02:05.159 --> 02:06.327
Interesting.

02:06.360 --> 02:08.929
Bam and zup.
(chuckles)

02:08.962 --> 02:11.098
This seminar's already paying
for itself.

02:11.131 --> 02:13.667
Homer Simpson,
are you watching football

02:13.701 --> 02:15.469
through your pants pocket?

02:15.503 --> 02:19.440
But do you know how much love
is lost between these teams?

02:19.473 --> 02:20.608
None!

02:20.641 --> 02:23.110
Turn it off!

02:23.143 --> 02:25.346
This bag of concentrated death

02:25.379 --> 02:28.649
is what the kids today
call "blizzard."

02:28.682 --> 02:30.117
Allow me to demonstrate.

02:30.150 --> 02:32.286
On Skin-ner!

02:32.320 --> 02:34.955
Superintendent,
I-I must protest.

02:34.988 --> 02:37.124
I'm an educational professional
who...

02:37.157 --> 02:39.460
-(grunting)
-That's a good boy.

02:39.493 --> 02:40.628
Take your medicine.

02:40.661 --> 02:41.662
(inhales, sighs)

02:41.695 --> 02:43.964
Oh, let's get out of here.

02:43.997 --> 02:47.000
I guess we can watch
the PowerPoint presentation

02:47.034 --> 02:48.168
in bed tonight.

02:48.202 --> 02:50.371
Oh, that sounds magical.

02:50.404 --> 02:52.740
(quietly):
Just don't be conspicuous.

02:54.007 --> 02:55.509
(phone ringing)

02:55.543 --> 02:56.644
Ooh, it's Lenny.

02:56.677 --> 02:58.646
Homer, I found my birth mom!

02:58.679 --> 03:01.315
Her name is Cheryl, and
she wants nothing to do with...

03:01.349 --> 03:02.683
(Marge groans)

03:03.584 --> 03:06.320
(gasps)
A wedding expo!

03:06.354 --> 03:08.856
Marge, there is no way
I'd ever be interested in--

03:08.889 --> 03:10.324
Is there a girl in that cake?

03:10.358 --> 03:12.159
No, just cake.

03:12.192 --> 03:14.528
Oh... that is so sexy.

03:14.562 --> 03:15.996
After you, Marge.

03:16.029 --> 03:18.532
Ooh, a wedding expo!

03:18.566 --> 03:21.735
It's like going
to a thousand weddings at once.

03:21.769 --> 03:25.739
Sneaking in will be the most
romantic thing we've ever done.

03:25.773 --> 03:27.241
More than our real wedding?

03:27.275 --> 03:29.343
A thousand times more.

03:29.377 --> 03:32.346
I was pregnant,
and you had a fever of 103.

03:32.380 --> 03:35.082
103.4.

03:35.115 --> 03:37.785
Aw, you remembered.

03:45.092 --> 03:47.060
("Allegro Non Molto" from
Vivaldi's Four Seasons playing)

03:49.797 --> 03:52.533
(sniffles)
It's so beautiful.

03:52.566 --> 03:53.901
(sniffles)
Oh.

03:53.934 --> 03:57.070
Even the prenups are gorgeous.

03:59.239 --> 04:01.208
(techno music playing)

04:01.241 --> 04:03.210
Your bride will look radiant

04:03.243 --> 04:05.245
next to these hideous
bridesmaids dresses

04:05.279 --> 04:07.715
made in colors
known to scare seagulls.

04:07.748 --> 04:10.083
Oh, so beautiful!

04:10.117 --> 04:11.452
Come back here, you.

04:11.485 --> 04:14.054
You've got 12 more drugs
to test.

04:14.087 --> 04:17.658
I both see and am God.

04:18.759 --> 04:20.461
(suspenseful music playing)

04:20.494 --> 04:23.397
Who will protect me
when you die?

04:23.431 --> 04:25.899
Nothing's gonna happen to...

04:25.933 --> 04:26.734
(grunts)

04:26.767 --> 04:28.402
Does this house have a mixer?

04:28.436 --> 04:30.103
We could make face cookies.

04:30.137 --> 04:31.739
(chuckles)

04:31.772 --> 04:34.742
Aw! You're gonna make
such a good dad.

04:34.775 --> 04:37.411
(moaning)

04:37.445 --> 04:39.413
(groans)
I feel like a walk.

04:39.447 --> 04:40.981
You want to take a walk?

04:41.014 --> 04:44.418
I feel glued to my seat
for reasons I don't understand.

04:44.452 --> 04:45.786
It's all over, sweetheart.

04:45.819 --> 04:47.421
The curse is broken.

04:47.455 --> 04:49.923
Grandma will take care of you
from now o...

04:49.957 --> 04:51.925
-(groans)
-(buzzing)

04:51.959 --> 04:52.960
Ah!

04:52.993 --> 04:55.463
Come on!

04:56.864 --> 04:58.265
(Shauna giggling)

04:58.298 --> 05:00.000
JIMBO:
Let's see if we can both fit

05:00.033 --> 05:01.802
in Homer's underwear.

05:01.835 --> 05:03.604
This is very sobering.

05:03.637 --> 05:06.340
Why did we think
this would be cool?

05:06.374 --> 05:08.141
What are you kids
doing out so late?

05:08.175 --> 05:10.110
Babysitter party at our house.

05:10.143 --> 05:12.279
Why don't you come inside
for a mug of cocoa?

05:12.312 --> 05:13.947
-(ding)
-Coco-nut, that is,

05:13.981 --> 05:16.484
to fill your belly
with much-needed potassium.

05:16.517 --> 05:17.485
(chuckles):
Grins, people.

05:17.518 --> 05:18.486
Thanks.

05:18.519 --> 05:20.187
Potassi-yum.

05:20.220 --> 05:21.455
This was a great idea.

05:21.489 --> 05:23.524
It's like all the fun
of a wedding

05:23.557 --> 05:25.459
without the boredom
of a wedding!

05:25.493 --> 05:27.495
And who are you two?

05:27.528 --> 05:29.329
Um, why, we're...

05:29.363 --> 05:30.798
wedding planners!

05:30.831 --> 05:33.634
Yes, and we're wondering
about your products.

05:33.667 --> 05:35.836
(giggles)
For our clients.

05:35.869 --> 05:39.540
Well, the Toast Master
is an AI-powered microphone

05:39.573 --> 05:42.042
that guarantees
your best man's toast

05:42.075 --> 05:44.478
will be heartwarming
and tasteful,

05:44.512 --> 05:47.981
no matter how drunk
or passive-aggressive he is.

05:48.015 --> 05:49.650
Ooh. Give it a try, Homie.

05:49.683 --> 05:51.351
Oh, I couldn't.

05:51.385 --> 05:53.854
Pretend one of my sisters
is getting married.

05:53.887 --> 05:55.856
That hairy-legged ashtray?

05:55.889 --> 05:57.391
Give me the mic.

05:57.425 --> 05:59.359
When I heard
a guy was marrying Selma,

05:59.393 --> 06:01.495
-I thought, That poor...
-MALE VOICE: Genius.

06:01.529 --> 06:03.497
-...must be...
-Fully sighted.

06:03.531 --> 06:04.865
-...and...
-Not marrying her

06:04.898 --> 06:05.999
to harvest her organs.

06:06.033 --> 06:07.367
(laughs)

06:07.401 --> 06:08.669
Thank God. The Heffernans.

06:08.702 --> 06:10.370
Oh, right. That's me.

06:10.404 --> 06:12.072
D.R. Heffernan.

06:12.105 --> 06:13.674
-(quietly): That's "Doctor."
-Right.

06:13.707 --> 06:15.375
Dr. D.R. Heffernan.

06:15.409 --> 06:17.177
The keynote speech
is in two minutes.

06:17.210 --> 06:20.514
-What's a keynote speech?
-(chuckles)

06:20.548 --> 06:23.751
Imagine Dr. Heffernan asking me
what a keynote speech is.

06:23.784 --> 06:24.885
This way.

06:24.918 --> 06:26.687
Finally, things are looking up

06:26.720 --> 06:29.022
for the person
I'm pretending to be.

06:29.056 --> 06:30.524
(laughter)

06:30.558 --> 06:33.093
And the number one
new wedding trend is...

06:33.126 --> 06:35.095
True love!

06:35.128 --> 06:38.198
AUDIENCE:
True love! True love!

06:38.231 --> 06:41.034
Buy our book if we have one.

06:41.068 --> 06:43.904
I'm starting to think
that's not Dr. Heffernan.

06:46.073 --> 06:48.041
(moaning)

06:48.075 --> 06:49.543
(chuckles)
What a...

06:49.577 --> 06:52.546
(moans)
...perfect night.

06:52.580 --> 06:54.548
You wait here while I go...

06:54.582 --> 06:58.218
(seductively):
pay the babysitter.

06:58.251 --> 06:59.453
-(laughter)
-(loud music playing)

06:59.487 --> 07:00.788
I'm not paying you!

07:00.821 --> 07:02.623
Get out of my house!

07:04.424 --> 07:07.094
-Later.
-And now, my lady,
to the boudoir,

07:07.127 --> 07:10.297
which I believe
is somewhere near the bedroom.

07:10.330 --> 07:11.298
(chuckles):
Ooh!

07:11.331 --> 07:13.066
Ooh!

07:13.100 --> 07:15.569
(grunts)
Have I picked you up yet?

07:15.603 --> 07:17.304
I can't te-- Oh!

07:17.337 --> 07:18.472
(strained):
You're so light!

07:18.506 --> 07:20.107
(grunting)

07:20.140 --> 07:22.309
-Ow!
-(inhales deeply)

07:22.342 --> 07:23.477
(strained):
Perfect end to...

07:23.511 --> 07:25.445
perfect night!

07:25.479 --> 07:27.748
Voulez-vous coucher avec...

07:27.781 --> 07:29.750
-(cracking, popping)
-(screams)

07:29.783 --> 07:31.251
(grunting)

07:31.284 --> 07:33.787
-What the?! (shouting)
-Ow!

07:33.821 --> 07:36.323
(both groaning)

07:36.356 --> 07:38.826
I guess
we should stop listening now.

07:38.859 --> 07:40.127
No one's making you stay.

07:45.165 --> 07:47.501
Marge, I'm afraid your days
of walking are over.

07:47.535 --> 07:48.769
Oh, my God!

07:48.802 --> 07:50.504
For about 36 hours.

07:50.538 --> 07:53.273
By then, this mild ankle sprain
should be good as new.

07:53.306 --> 07:54.842
It's my fault.

07:54.875 --> 07:58.278
Homie wouldn't have dropped me
if I hadn't put on a few pounds.

07:58.311 --> 08:01.348
Nonsense. It's not your fault
you're married to a...

08:01.381 --> 08:03.283
this.

08:03.316 --> 08:04.952
(moans)

08:04.985 --> 08:07.621
And it was such
a good date night.

08:07.655 --> 08:09.456
Well, now it's a hernia morning.

08:09.489 --> 08:11.959
See, you've got a tear
in your abdominal wall

08:11.992 --> 08:14.628
and a section of your intestine
has pushed through.

08:14.662 --> 08:16.463
Aren't you going to chuckle?

08:16.496 --> 08:18.465
An inguinal hernia
is no laughing matter.

08:18.498 --> 08:19.700
(chuckles)

08:19.733 --> 08:21.001
"Inguinal."

08:21.034 --> 08:22.803
Will I need surgery?

08:22.836 --> 08:24.337
Possibly. But don't be alarmed.

08:24.371 --> 08:26.640
It's just some scalpel work
around your scrotum.

08:26.674 --> 08:28.475
(groans)

08:28.508 --> 08:30.844
-(engine revs, tires screech)
-A little more.

08:30.878 --> 08:32.546
-(engine revs, tires screech)
-Little more.

08:32.580 --> 08:34.715
-(engine revs, tires screech)
-Little more...

08:34.748 --> 08:36.650
No, those are the wipers!

08:36.684 --> 08:38.986
Oh, you just called OnStar.

08:39.019 --> 08:40.988
Now, look, you two,
you're not kids anymore.

08:41.021 --> 08:42.990
Listen to your body.
It'll tell you what to do.

08:43.023 --> 08:45.325
(engine revs, tires screech)

08:45.358 --> 08:46.493
WOMAN:
OnStar operator.

08:46.526 --> 08:47.728
What is your emergency?

08:47.761 --> 08:50.163
Every comedian
I thought is funny

08:50.197 --> 08:51.699
is dead.

08:51.732 --> 08:55.502
â™ª The Itchy and Scratchy Show! â™ª

08:55.535 --> 08:57.504
Hmm. "Possible side effects

08:57.537 --> 08:59.840
may include hallucinations..."

08:59.873 --> 09:02.009
(angrily):
...mm, "irritability,

09:02.042 --> 09:06.379
inability to fo... cus."

09:06.413 --> 09:08.515
Blah, blah, blah.

09:08.548 --> 09:10.383
"Do not mix with alcohol"?

09:10.417 --> 09:12.185
Fine, I'll drink it separately.

09:12.219 --> 09:13.787
Boy, get me a beer.

09:15.555 --> 09:17.691
-(Bart humming)
-(grunting)

09:17.725 --> 09:19.526
-Huh? What are you doing?
-(chuckles)

09:19.559 --> 09:20.560
Helping you get better.

09:20.594 --> 09:21.929
I was watching Animal Planet,

09:21.962 --> 09:23.697
and they said,
if it can't reach its own food,

09:23.731 --> 09:25.265
the hippo dies.

09:25.298 --> 09:26.533
Why, you little...!

09:26.566 --> 09:28.201
(chuckles)

09:28.235 --> 09:30.704
Bart, honey,
your father and I need you

09:30.738 --> 09:32.706
to be a little more grown-up.

09:32.740 --> 09:33.741
Can you do that?

09:33.774 --> 09:35.208
I bet you can.

09:35.242 --> 09:36.944
You got it, Mom.

09:40.247 --> 09:41.615
(humming)

09:41.649 --> 09:44.785
Honey, I signed us up for
physical therapy this afternoon.

09:44.818 --> 09:46.553
They sound terrific.

09:46.586 --> 09:48.055
Even booking the appointment,

09:48.088 --> 09:50.057
they told me, "Great job."

09:50.090 --> 09:51.424
Absolutely.

09:51.458 --> 09:52.592
I want to get better.

09:52.626 --> 09:53.894
I really do.

09:53.927 --> 09:54.962
I know you do.

09:54.995 --> 09:56.563
We'll start tomorrow.

09:56.596 --> 09:58.632
Mwah.

09:58.666 --> 10:00.567
MALE VOICE:
I would caution
against physical therapy.

10:00.600 --> 10:03.637
Guys like us
don't look good in shorts.

10:05.939 --> 10:08.776
Oh, why is it never hair growth?

10:08.809 --> 10:11.578
It's me, your hernia.

10:11.611 --> 10:14.581
Homer, your doctor told you
to listen to your body.

10:14.614 --> 10:15.816
And I am telling you,

10:15.849 --> 10:18.251
just take it easy.

10:18.285 --> 10:19.252
Are you sure?

10:19.286 --> 10:21.121
I just promised Marge.

10:21.154 --> 10:23.590
Take it from your hernia.

10:23.623 --> 10:25.125
(giggles)

10:25.158 --> 10:27.127
(Marge grunting)

10:27.160 --> 10:29.129
(New Zealand accent):
Oh, you've got this, Marge!

10:29.162 --> 10:30.798
Now, focus on your co-ah.

10:30.831 --> 10:33.600
I guess I've been
neglecting my key-aah.

10:33.633 --> 10:35.135
Is it this?

10:35.168 --> 10:37.604
No. All I can say is,
if you have a muscle

10:37.637 --> 10:40.941
and you know what it does,
then that is not the co-ah.

10:40.974 --> 10:42.609
Oh, the core.

10:42.642 --> 10:44.277
Right, that's
what I said-- co-ah.

10:44.311 --> 10:47.180
Now, what sports are we
gettin' you ready for, Marge?

10:47.214 --> 10:49.282
Rollerblading? Uh, Muay Thai?

10:49.316 --> 10:51.618
No, nothing like that.

10:51.651 --> 10:53.620
I only have to be
in good enough shape

10:53.653 --> 10:57.290
to take care
of an immobile 240-pound man.

10:57.324 --> 10:58.992
Ah, so Homer isn't coming, eh?

10:59.026 --> 11:01.161
You know,
I could go to him at work.

11:01.194 --> 11:03.663
Oh, he's got
enough stress at work.

11:05.899 --> 11:07.868
All right, well,
we'll get you into something.

11:07.901 --> 11:09.870
Uh, mountain biking?
Free bouldering?

11:09.903 --> 11:14.674
I got it. Marge, we are going
to get you kitesurfing!

11:14.708 --> 11:15.876
Kitesurfing?

11:15.909 --> 11:17.911
I could do that with Homie.

11:22.750 --> 11:23.917
(alarm blares)

11:24.918 --> 11:26.553
You know what?

11:26.586 --> 11:29.322
I'm not letting Homer
drag me down this time.

11:29.356 --> 11:32.192
Yes, I want to learn
kitesurfing.

11:32.225 --> 11:33.727
â™ª Let's go kitesurfing now â™ª

11:33.761 --> 11:35.195
â™ª Middle-aged ladies
learning how â™ª

11:35.228 --> 11:37.697
â™ª Come on Kitesurf-ari
with me... â™ª

11:37.731 --> 11:38.999
Kitesurfing's a simple sport.

11:39.032 --> 11:41.334
All you need is
the wind and the waves.

11:41.368 --> 11:45.038
And a spreader-bar, bindings,
impact vest, chicken loop,

11:45.072 --> 11:47.340
donkey stick, squirrel clip,
and, of course, parking pass.

11:47.374 --> 11:51.511
Yeah, ruining
people's day at the beach.

11:51.544 --> 11:54.514
We are worse than sand
in a hot dog, eh, Lou?

11:54.547 --> 11:56.083
You know there's
a double murder downtown?

11:56.116 --> 11:59.086
Well, now it's a triple,
'cause you just killed my day.

11:59.119 --> 12:00.553
Keep the kite swooping, Marge.

12:00.587 --> 12:02.589
Follow the timing of my pecs.

12:02.622 --> 12:04.591
Left, right, left, right,

12:04.624 --> 12:05.859
left, left, right...

12:05.893 --> 12:07.895
Ah. Don't look me
in the eyes, Marge.

12:07.928 --> 12:09.529
My pecs are down here.

12:09.562 --> 12:10.864
There you are.

12:10.898 --> 12:13.066
Left, right,
left, left, right...

12:13.901 --> 12:16.703
So, Mom is kitesurfing

12:16.736 --> 12:19.106
while Dad is eating
three desserts.

12:19.139 --> 12:22.375
Oh, your grandma and I
had our differences,

12:22.409 --> 12:26.713
but we stopped arguing when she
disappeared for three decades.

12:26.746 --> 12:27.915
Oh.

12:28.748 --> 12:30.117
Oh, it's so nice

12:30.150 --> 12:32.119
to get an evening out
just with you.

12:32.152 --> 12:33.753
Can I get you a baby chair?

12:33.787 --> 12:35.055
No? You're good?

12:35.088 --> 12:36.556
Homer's-a talking to nobody.

12:36.589 --> 12:38.758
The Cat Lady
is eating with cats.

12:38.792 --> 12:40.894
Ralph is in-a the lobster tank?

12:40.928 --> 12:42.896
I'm expensive.

12:42.930 --> 12:44.731
Homer, you're doing great.

12:44.764 --> 12:47.434
Look at those guys--
eating half portions,

12:47.467 --> 12:49.469
trying to stay fit.

12:49.502 --> 12:52.239
They're just setting
themselves up to meet my buddies

12:52.272 --> 12:55.642
Torn ACL and Pinched Nerve.

12:55.675 --> 12:57.144
Now, you, you're smart.

12:57.177 --> 12:59.579
The most strenuous thing
you're gonna do

12:59.612 --> 13:02.582
is fart
"The Star Spangled Banner."

13:02.615 --> 13:04.784
Mm, that's got
a difficult range.

13:04.818 --> 13:06.653
Is there an easier anthem?

13:06.686 --> 13:10.824
Hey, the riskiest thing
we're gonna do is have lasagna.

13:10.858 --> 13:12.759
We just had lasagna.

13:12.792 --> 13:13.994
Have it again!

13:14.027 --> 13:15.628
Nobody's gonna stop you.

13:15.662 --> 13:17.364
I love you.

13:19.799 --> 13:21.134
Who are you?

13:21.168 --> 13:23.803
Cirrhosis. What's it to ya?

13:27.807 --> 13:29.776
Homer, I'm going to the beach.

13:29.809 --> 13:32.279
I packed lunch for two
if you want to come.

13:32.312 --> 13:33.680
Oh, the beach.

13:33.713 --> 13:35.782
Sure. Let's get sunstroke,

13:35.815 --> 13:37.851
a hyperextended tendon,

13:37.885 --> 13:41.621
and wrap it up by getting
decapitated by a Frisbee.

13:41.654 --> 13:43.456
Hard pass.

13:43.490 --> 13:45.625
Sorry, Marge. Hard pass.

13:45.658 --> 13:49.029
(sighs) It's been so long
since you made a move on me.

13:49.062 --> 13:50.797
Or any move.

13:50.830 --> 13:53.166
Um, how about
if I drone you a kiss?

13:53.200 --> 13:54.501
(kiss)

13:57.837 --> 13:59.039
(horn honks)

13:59.072 --> 14:00.673
Hurry up, Marge.

14:00.707 --> 14:02.642
We're gonna catch big air
all morning,

14:02.675 --> 14:05.645
sleep all afternoon,
then boil a sheep for breakfast.

14:05.678 --> 14:07.680
I'm still on New Zealand time.

14:07.714 --> 14:10.150
Been here 12 years
but can't shake it.

14:10.183 --> 14:12.852
Please, Homer,
you're my husband.

14:12.886 --> 14:15.055
Get up and live.

14:15.088 --> 14:17.690
Sorry, Marge.
I got to go with my gut.

14:17.724 --> 14:19.559
-(yawns)
-(blows raspberry)

14:21.694 --> 14:25.398
If you don't come after me,
there's a big problem.

14:26.433 --> 14:28.701
The drone doesn't count.

14:33.873 --> 14:36.876
Hey. Can you watch the kids
this afternoon?

14:36.910 --> 14:38.545
Sorry, Marge.

14:38.578 --> 14:40.013
Hernia.

14:40.047 --> 14:41.881
We make quite a team.

14:41.915 --> 14:43.583
Who are you talking to?

14:43.616 --> 14:45.852
Hey, I do not have voices
in my head.

14:45.885 --> 14:47.520
(quietly):
They're in my crotch.

14:47.554 --> 14:49.089
-(giggles)
-Ooh!

14:49.122 --> 14:52.225
Just call my sisters
to watch the kids.

14:54.394 --> 14:55.362
(snoring)

14:55.395 --> 14:56.896
Let's drop him in the woods

14:56.930 --> 14:58.898
and see if he can
find his way back.

15:03.570 --> 15:05.538
Our parents are drifting apart.

15:05.572 --> 15:08.041
And as much as
I don't enjoy doing this,

15:08.075 --> 15:10.710
I need the advice
of the only couple we know

15:10.743 --> 15:12.712
that seems to like each other.

15:12.745 --> 15:14.247
I'm stuck with you.

15:14.281 --> 15:16.749
Relationships
are simple, really.

15:16.783 --> 15:19.219
Like, if Shauna's best friend
Tiffany comes on to me,

15:19.252 --> 15:20.954
I make out with Shauna,

15:20.988 --> 15:23.123
but I pretend it's her friend.

15:23.156 --> 15:24.257
Aw.

15:24.291 --> 15:25.558
(moaning)

15:25.592 --> 15:27.560
Tiffany. Oh, yeah.

15:27.594 --> 15:28.962
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.

15:28.996 --> 15:31.264
Guys. Guys, guys, guys.
Let's focus!

15:31.298 --> 15:32.299
Focus.

15:32.332 --> 15:34.401
Please give me something useful.

15:34.434 --> 15:36.936
Okay. Your parents
have just got to find

15:36.970 --> 15:38.938
something they both like doing.

15:38.972 --> 15:40.940
Like, I like laughing at losers.

15:40.974 --> 15:43.743
And I make losers happen.

15:43.776 --> 15:46.413
-(grunts)
-(laughing)

15:46.446 --> 15:48.748
(moaning)

15:48.781 --> 15:50.750
(gasps)
Common interests!

15:50.783 --> 15:52.019
Of course.

15:55.955 --> 15:57.157
TV ANNOUNCER:
Back now to live coverage

15:57.190 --> 15:59.926
of Little XII college golf
on ESPN-D3-2,

15:59.959 --> 16:03.263
your second home
for Division III sports.

16:03.296 --> 16:05.265
Dad, can you drive us
down to the beach?

16:05.298 --> 16:08.001
I have a school project on...
sea turtles.

16:08.035 --> 16:10.037
Don't listen to them.

16:11.038 --> 16:13.273
You can see me?!

16:13.306 --> 16:15.475
It's always the babies.

16:19.979 --> 16:22.615
Hey. Where are the turtles?

16:22.649 --> 16:24.851
There are no turtles, Homer.
It's a trick.

16:24.884 --> 16:27.787
These kids are trying to help
you, 'cause they love you.

16:27.820 --> 16:31.124
So there never were turtles?

16:31.158 --> 16:32.159
No turtles!

16:32.192 --> 16:33.626
I'm starting to think

16:33.660 --> 16:36.129
there were no turtles.

16:36.163 --> 16:37.730
(gasps)
Marge.

16:38.831 --> 16:40.633
She looks so beautiful.

16:40.667 --> 16:42.502
I've been such a fool.

16:42.535 --> 16:45.872
And you forgot to get
a parking pass. Heh.

16:45.905 --> 16:47.907
Our work is done, Lou.

16:49.342 --> 16:50.577
(shudders):
Oh...

16:56.549 --> 16:59.319
I'll never let
myself go like that!

16:59.352 --> 17:01.354
I'm-a comin', Marge!

17:02.355 --> 17:04.257
Ew! Gross!

17:06.193 --> 17:08.228
Homer, you're making me mad.

17:08.261 --> 17:10.830
And if there's one thing
you don't want to aggravate,

17:10.863 --> 17:12.865
it's a hernia!

17:17.036 --> 17:19.172
I'm Marge's husband, Homer.

17:19.206 --> 17:21.007
Homer! Good-o!

17:21.040 --> 17:23.009
Would you like me
to rehab you at work?

17:23.042 --> 17:25.412
I could come right to you.
Same price.

17:25.445 --> 17:28.681
Maybe. But now I need
your biggest, fastest kite.

17:28.715 --> 17:29.916
-The Widdamaka?
-What?

17:29.949 --> 17:31.718
Can you say that
without an accent?

17:31.751 --> 17:33.853
-(without accent):
The Widowmaker.
-Oh! That's scary!

17:33.886 --> 17:35.888
-Back to the accent!
-The Widdamaka.

17:35.922 --> 17:37.023
I'll take it!

17:37.056 --> 17:39.192
When I got married,
I took a vow:

17:39.226 --> 17:40.693
"Something, something, something

17:40.727 --> 17:42.595
till death something."

17:46.099 --> 17:47.700
(yelps)

17:47.734 --> 17:49.436
Homer! Rooster your gimbal!

17:49.469 --> 17:50.737
Rooster your gimbal!

17:50.770 --> 17:52.105
What does that mean?!

17:52.139 --> 17:53.640
Pull the rope!

17:55.308 --> 17:56.809
The other rope.

17:59.446 --> 18:00.880
Homie!

18:00.913 --> 18:02.449
You came for me!

18:02.482 --> 18:04.451
And I'll never leave you.

18:04.484 --> 18:06.719
Except right now
when the wind blows me

18:06.753 --> 18:08.288
(fading):
God knows where....

18:08.321 --> 18:10.757
They're headed for a wind farm!

18:12.325 --> 18:13.593
(both gasp)

18:13.626 --> 18:16.229
BOTH:
Whoa...!

18:16.263 --> 18:17.564
(kiss)

18:17.597 --> 18:19.065
Whoa...!

18:19.098 --> 18:20.099
(kiss)

18:20.133 --> 18:22.335
Whoa...!

18:26.606 --> 18:28.975
(New England accent):
Well, Mother,
looks like we caught

18:29.008 --> 18:30.943
a couple more kiteboarders.

18:30.977 --> 18:33.780
-I'll get the big ladder.
-I'll tell the hospital

18:33.813 --> 18:36.949
their power's gonna be down
for a while.

18:38.117 --> 18:41.087
Strong woman, I love you.

18:41.120 --> 18:43.790
(exhales)
And I love you.

18:43.823 --> 18:46.926
And never again
will I listen to a doctor.

18:46.959 --> 18:49.095
Wait, that's not the takeaway.

18:49.128 --> 18:51.130
Takeaway?
That's a good idea!

18:51.164 --> 18:53.266
Yello? Pizza Palace?

18:53.300 --> 18:55.268
Can I get
a Henry the Eight-Inch Pizza

18:55.302 --> 18:56.436
with extra meat?

18:56.469 --> 18:58.805
And a side
of chocolate cheesy bread?

18:58.838 --> 19:00.006
No such thing.

19:00.039 --> 19:01.808
-Can you make it anyways?
-(groans)

19:06.179 --> 19:08.114
Chief, I've got to make dinner
for my kids. Could you please

19:08.147 --> 19:10.817
-tell me what this is about?
-Like most physical therapists

19:10.850 --> 19:14.787
in America, this man
is actually a Russian spy.

19:14.821 --> 19:17.156
Nigel is a spy?

19:17.190 --> 19:18.491
Dimitri Nigelovonovitch.

19:18.525 --> 19:20.960
Did you ever wonder
why he was so interested

19:20.993 --> 19:22.962
in seeing your husband at work?

19:22.995 --> 19:25.131
I thought
it was close to his house.

19:25.164 --> 19:28.301
Didn't you ever ask yourself
how a beach bum like him

19:28.335 --> 19:31.638
could afford a top-of-the-line
2007 Saturn SUV

19:31.671 --> 19:33.640
with a full spare tire?

19:33.673 --> 19:35.675
I guess I didn't want to know.

19:35.708 --> 19:40.079
Just thank God, thank God your
husband is entrapping him now.

19:41.348 --> 19:44.817
Homer, I just need
a few pictures of...

19:44.851 --> 19:46.519
the co-ah.

19:46.553 --> 19:48.488
-The what?
-Goo-ah.

19:48.521 --> 19:51.324
-The car?
-Goo-ah.

19:51.358 --> 19:53.326
Like a crow? Caw?

19:53.360 --> 19:55.161
Co-ahr-car?

19:55.194 --> 19:58.197
(Russian accent): Damn it.
Show me your reactor core.

19:58.231 --> 20:00.233
All units, move in!

20:04.203 --> 20:06.873
("Theme from
Mission: Impossible" playing)

20:14.714 --> 20:17.384
â™ª

21:09.336 --> 21:11.338
Shh!
