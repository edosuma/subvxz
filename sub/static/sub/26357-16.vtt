-I thought, That poor...
-MALE VOICE: Genius.

06:01.529 --> 06:03.497

-...and...
-Not marrying her

06:04.898 --> 06:05.999

for the person
I'm pretending to be.

06:29.056 --> 06:30.524

-Later.
-And now, my lady,
to the boudoir,

07:07.127 --> 07:10.297
which I believe
is somewhere near the bedroom.

07:10.330 --> 07:11.298

Have I picked you up yet?

07:15.603 --> 07:17.304
I can't te-- Oh!

07:33.821 --> 07:36.323

07:36.356 --> 07:38.826
I guess
we should stop listening now.

07:38.859 --> 07:40.127
No one's making you stay.

07:45.165 --> 07:47.501
Marge, I'm afraid your days
of walking are over.

07:47.535 --> 07:48.769
Oh, my God!

07:48.802 --> 07:50.504
For about 36 hours.

07:50.538 --> 07:53.273
By then, this mild ankle sprain
should be good as new.

07:53.306 --> 07:54.842
It's my fault.

07:54.875 --> 07:58.278
Homie wouldn't have dropped me
if I hadn't put on a few pounds.

07:58.311 --> 08:01.348
Nonsense. It's not your fault
you're married to a...

08:01.381 --> 08:03.283
this.

08:03.316 --> 08:04.952
(moans)

08:04.985 --> 08:07.621
And it was such
a good date night.

08:07.655 --> 08:09.456
Well, now it's a hernia morning.

08:09.489 --> 08:11.959
See, you've got a tear
in your abdominal wall

08:11.992 --> 08:14.628
and a section of your intestine
has pushed through.

08:14.662 --> 08:16.463
Aren't you going to chuckle?

08:16.496 --> 08:18.465
An inguinal hernia
is no laughing matter.

08:18.498 --> 08:19.700
(chuckles)

08:19.733 --> 08:21.001
"Inguinal."

08:21.034 --> 08:22.803
Will I need surgery?

08:22.836 --> 08:24.337
Possibly. But don't be alarmed.

08:24.371 --> 08:26.640
It's just some scalpel work
around your scrotum.

08:26.674 --> 08:28.475
(groans)

08:28.508 --> 08:30.844

-A little more.

-(engine revs, tires screech)
-Little more.

08:32.580 --> 08:34.715

-Little more...

08:34.748 --> 08:36.650
No, those are the wipers!

Oh, you just called OnStar.

09:20.594 --> 09:21.929
I was watching Animal Planet,

09:21.962 --> 09:23.697
and they said,
if it can't reach its own food,

09:23.731 --> 09:25.265
the hippo dies.

09:25.298 --> 09:26.533
Why, you little...!

09:26.566 --> 09:28.201
(chuckles)

09:28.235 --> 09:30.704
Bart, honey,
your father and I need you

09:30.738 --> 09:32.706
to be a little more grown-up.

09:32.740 --> 09:33.741
Can you do that?

09:33.774 --> 09:35.208
I bet you can.

09:35.242 --> 09:36.944
You got it, Mom.

09:40.247 --> 09:41.615
(humming)

09:41.649 --> 09:44.785
Honey, I signed us up for
physical therapy this afternoon.

09:44.818 --> 09:46.553
They sound terrific.

09:46.586 --> 09:48.055
Even booking the appointment,

09:48.088 --> 09:50.057
they told me, "Great job."

09:50.090 --> 09:51.424
Absolutely.

09:51.458 --> 09:52.592
I want to get better.

09:52.626 --> 09:53.894
I really do.

09:53.927 --> 09:54.962
I know you do.

09:54.995 --> 09:56.563
We'll start tomorrow.

09:56.596 --> 09:58.632
Mwah.

09:58.666 --> 10:00.567
MALE VOICE:
I would caution
against physical therapy.

10:00.600 --> 10:03.637
Guys like us
don't look good in shorts.

10:05.939 --> 10:08.776
Oh, why is it never hair growth?

10:08.809 --> 10:11.578
It's me, your hernia.

10:11.611 --> 10:14.581
Homer, your doctor told you
to listen to your body.

10:14.614 --> 10:15.816
And I am telling you,

10:15.849 --> 10:18.251
just take it easy.

10:18.285 --> 10:19.252
Are you sure?

10:19.286 --> 10:21.121
I just promised Marge.

10:21.154 --> 10:23.590
Take it from your hernia.

10:23.623 --> 10:25.125
(giggles)

10:25.158 --> 10:27.127
(Marge grunting)

10:27.160 --> 10:29.129
(New Zealand accent):
Oh, you've got this, Marge!

10:29.162 --> 10:30.798
Now, focus on your co-ah.

10:30.831 --> 10:33.600
I guess I've been
neglecting my key-aah.

10:33.633 --> 10:35.135
Is it this?

10:35.168 --> 10:37.604
No. All I can say is,
if you have a muscle

10:37.637 --> 10:40.941
and you know what it does,
then that is not the co-ah.

10:40.974 --> 10:42.609
Oh, the core.

10:42.642 --> 10:44.277
Right, that's
what I said-- co-ah.

10:44.311 --> 10:47.180
Now, what sports are we
gettin' you ready for, Marge?

10:47.214 --> 10:49.282
Rollerblading? Uh, Muay Thai?

10:49.316 --> 10:51.618
No, nothing like that.

10:51.651 --> 10:53.620
I only have to be
in good enough shape

10:53.653 --> 10:57.290
to take care
of an immobile 240-pound man.

10:57.324 --> 10:58.992
Ah, so Homer isn't coming, eh?

10:59.026 --> 11:01.161
You know,
I could go to him at work.

11:01.194 --> 11:03.663
Oh, he's got
enough stress at work.

11:05.899 --> 11:07.868
All right, well,
we'll get you into something.

11:07.901 --> 11:09.870
Uh, mountain biking?
Free bouldering?

11:09.903 --> 11:14.674
I got it. Marge, we are going
to get you kitesurfing!

11:14.708 --> 11:15.876
Kitesurfing?

11:15.909 --> 11:17.911
I could do that with Homie.

11:22.750 --> 11:23.917
(alarm blares)

11:24.918 --> 11:26.553
You know what?

11:26.586 --> 11:29.322
I'm not letting Homer
drag me down this time.

11:29.356 --> 11:32.192
Yes, I want to learn
kitesurfing.

11:32.225 --> 11:33.727
♪ Let's go kitesurfing now ♪

11:33.761 --> 11:35.195
♪ Middle-aged ladies
learning how ♪

11:35.228 --> 11:37.697
♪ Come on Kitesurf-ari
with me... ♪

11:37.731 --> 11:38.999
Kitesurfing's a simple sport.

11:39.032 --> 11:41.334
All you need is
the wind and the waves.

11:41.368 --> 11:45.038
And a spreader-bar, bindings,
impact vest, chicken loop,

11:45.072 --> 11:47.340
donkey stick, squirrel clip,
and, of course, parking pass.

11:47.374 --> 11:51.511
Yeah, ruining
people's day at the beach.

11:51.544 --> 11:54.514
We are worse than sand
in a hot dog, eh, Lou?

11:54.547 --> 11:56.083
You know there's
a double murder downtown?

11:56.116 --> 11:59.086
Well, now it's a triple,
'cause you just killed my day.

11:59.119 --> 12:00.553
Keep the kite swooping, Marge.

12:00.587 --> 12:02.589
Follow the timing of my pecs.

12:02.622 --> 12:04.591
Left, right, left, right,

12:04.624 --> 12:05.859
left, left, right...

12:05.893 --> 12:07.895
Ah. Don't look me
in the eyes, Marge.

12:07.928 --> 12:09.529
My pecs are down here.

12:09.562 --> 12:10.864
There you are.

12:10.898 --> 12:13.066
Left, right,
left, left, right...

12:13.901 --> 12:16.703
So, Mom is kitesurfing

12:16.736 --> 12:19.106
while Dad is eating
three desserts.

12:19.139 --> 12:22.375
Oh, your grandma and I
had our differences,

12:22.409 --> 12:26.713
but we stopped arguing when she
disappeared for three decades.

12:26.746 --> 12:27.915
Oh.

12:28.748 --> 12:30.117
Oh, it's so nice

12:30.150 --> 12:32.119
to get an evening out
just with you.

12:32.152 --> 12:33.753
Can I get you a baby chair?

12:33.787 --> 12:35.055
No? You're good?

12:35.088 --> 12:36.556
Homer's-a talking to nobody.

12:36.589 --> 12:38.758
The Cat Lady
is eating with cats.

12:38.792 --> 12:40.894
Ralph is in-a the lobster tank?

12:40.928 --> 12:42.896
I'm expensive.

12:42.930 --> 12:44.731
Homer, you're doing great.

12:44.764 --> 12:47.434
Look at those guys--
eating half portions,

12:47.467 --> 12:49.469
trying to stay fit.

12:49.502 --> 12:52.239
They're just setting
themselves up to meet my buddies

12:52.272 --> 12:55.642
Torn ACL and Pinched Nerve.

12:55.675 --> 12:57.144
Now, you, you're smart.

12:57.177 --> 12:59.579
The most strenuous thing
you're gonna do

12:59.612 --> 13:02.582
is fart
"The Star Spangled Banner."

13:02.615 --> 13:04.784
Mm, that's got
a difficult range.

13:04.818 --> 13:06.653
Is there an easier anthem?

13:06.686 --> 13:10.824
Hey, the riskiest thing
we're gonna do is have lasagna.

13:10.858 --> 13:12.759
We just had lasagna.

13:12.792 --> 13:13.994
Have it again!

13:14.027 --> 13:15.628
Nobody's gonna stop you.

13:15.662 --> 13:17.364
I love you.

13:19.799 --> 13:21.134
Who are you?

13:21.168 --> 13:23.803
Cirrhosis. What's it to ya?

13:27.807 --> 13:29.776
Homer, I'm going to the beach.

13:29.809 --> 13:32.279
I packed lunch for two
if you want to come.

13:32.312 --> 13:33.680
Oh, the beach.

13:33.713 --> 13:35.782
Sure. Let's get sunstroke,

13:35.815 --> 13:37.851
a hyperextended tendon,

13:37.885 --> 13:41.621
and wrap it up by getting
decapitated by a Frisbee.

13:41.654 --> 13:43.456
Hard pass.

13:43.490 --> 13:45.625
Sorry, Marge. Hard pass.

13:45.658 --> 13:49.029
(sighs) It's been so long
since you made a move on me.

13:49.062 --> 13:50.797
Or any move.

13:50.830 --> 13:53.166
Um, how about
if I drone you a kiss?

13:53.200 --> 13:54.501
(kiss)

13:57.837 --> 13:59.039
(horn honks)

13:59.072 --> 14:00.673
Hurry up, Marge.

14:00.707 --> 14:02.642
We're gonna catch big air
all morning,

14:02.675 --> 14:05.645
sleep all afternoon,
then boil a sheep for breakfast.

14:05.678 --> 14:07.680
I'm still on New Zealand time.

14:07.714 --> 14:10.150
Been here 12 years
but can't shake it.

14:10.183 --> 14:12.852
Please, Homer,
you're my husband.

14:12.886 --> 14:15.055
Get up and live.

14:15.088 --> 14:17.690
Sorry, Marge.
I got to go with my gut.

14:17.724 --> 14:19.559
-(yawns)
-(blows raspberry)

14:21.694 --> 14:25.398
If you don't come after me,
there's a big problem.

14:26.433 --> 14:28.701
The drone doesn't count.

14:33.873 --> 14:36.876
Hey. Can you watch the kids
this afternoon?

14:36.910 --> 14:38.545
Sorry, Marge.

14:38.578 --> 14:40.013
Hernia.

14:40.047 --> 14:41.881
We make quite a team.

14:41.915 --> 14:43.583
Who are you talking to?

14:43.616 --> 14:45.852
Hey, I do not have voices
in my head.

14:45.885 --> 14:47.520
(quietly):
They're in my crotch.

14:47.554 --> 14:49.089
-(giggles)
-Ooh!

14:49.122 --> 14:52.225
Just call my sisters
to watch the kids.

14:54.394 --> 14:55.362
(snoring)

14:55.395 --> 14:56.896
Let's drop him in the woods

14:56.930 --> 14:58.898
and see if he can
find his way back.

15:03.570 --> 15:05.538
Our parents are drifting apart.

15:05.572 --> 15:08.041
And as much as
I don't enjoy doing this,

15:08.075 --> 15:10.710
I need the advice
of the only couple we know

15:10.743 --> 15:12.712
that seems to like each other.

15:12.745 --> 15:14.247
I'm stuck with you.

15:14.281 --> 15:16.749
Relationships
are simple, really.

15:16.783 --> 15:19.219
Like, if Shauna's best friend
Tiffany comes on to me,

15:19.252 --> 15:20.954
I make out with Shauna,

15:20.988 --> 15:23.123
but I pretend it's her friend.

15:23.156 --> 15:24.257
Aw.

15:24.291 --> 15:25.558
(moaning)

15:25.592 --> 15:27.560
Tiffany. Oh, yeah.

15:27.594 --> 15:28.962
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.

15:28.996 --> 15:31.264
Guys. Guys, guys, guys.
Let's focus!

15:31.298 --> 15:32.299
Focus.

15:32.332 --> 15:34.401
Please give me something useful.

15:34.434 --> 15:36.936
Okay. Your parents
have just got to find

15:36.970 --> 15:38.938
something they both like doing.

15:38.972 --> 15:40.940
Like, I like laughing at losers.

15:40.974 --> 15:43.743
And I make losers happen.

15:43.776 --> 15:46.413
-(grunts)
-(laughing)

15:46.446 --> 15:48.748
(moaning)

15:48.781 --> 15:50.750
(gasps)
Common interests!

15:50.783 --> 15:52.019
Of course.

15:55.955 --> 15:57.157
TV ANNOUNCER:
Back now to live coverage

15:57.190 --> 15:59.926
of Little XII college golf
on ESPN-D3-2,

15:59.959 --> 16:03.263
your second home
for Division III sports.

16:03.296 --> 16:05.265
Dad, can you drive us
down to the beach?

16:05.298 --> 16:08.001
I have a school project on...
sea turtles.

16:08.035 --> 16:10.037
Don't listen to them.

16:11.038 --> 16:13.273
You can see me?!

16:13.306 --> 16:15.475
It's always the babies.

16:19.979 --> 16:22.615
Hey. Where are the turtles?

16:22.649 --> 16:24.851
There are no turtles, Homer.
It's a trick.

16:24.884 --> 16:27.787
These kids are trying to help
you, 'cause they love you.

16:27.820 --> 16:31.124
So there never were turtles?

16:31.158 --> 16:32.159
No turtles!

16:32.192 --> 16:33.626
I'm starting to think

16:33.660 --> 16:36.129
there were no turtles.

16:36.163 --> 16:37.730
(gasps)
Marge.

16:38.831 --> 16:40.633
She looks so beautiful.

16:40.667 --> 16:42.502
I've been such a fool.

16:42.535 --> 16:45.872
And you forgot to get
a parking pass. Heh.

16:45.905 --> 16:47.907
Our work is done, Lou.

16:49.342 --> 16:50.577
(shudders):
Oh...

16:56.549 --> 16:59.319
I'll never let
myself go like that!

16:59.352 --> 17:01.354
I'm-a comin', Marge!

17:02.355 --> 17:04.257
Ew! Gross!

17:06.193 --> 17:08.228
Homer, you're making me mad.

17:08.261 --> 17:10.830
And if there's one thing
you don't want to aggravate,

17:10.863 --> 17:12.865
it's a hernia!

17:17.036 --> 17:19.172
I'm Marge's husband, Homer.

17:19.206 --> 17:21.007
Homer! Good-o!

17:21.040 --> 17:23.009
Would you like me
to rehab you at work?

17:23.042 --> 17:25.412
I could come right to you.
Same price.

17:25.445 --> 17:28.681
Maybe. But now I need
your biggest, fastest kite.

17:28.715 --> 17:29.916
-The Widdamaka?
-What?

17:29.949 --> 17:31.718
Can you say that
without an accent?

17:31.751 --> 17:33.853
-(without accent):
The Widowmaker.
-Oh! That's scary!

17:33.886 --> 17:35.888
-Back to the accent!
-The Widdamaka.

17:35.922 --> 17:37.023
I'll take it!

17:37.056 --> 17:39.192
When I got married,
I took a vow:

17:39.226 --> 17:40.693
"Something, something, something

17:40.727 --> 17:42.595
till death something."

17:46.099 --> 17:47.700
(yelps)

17:47.734 --> 17:49.436
Homer! Rooster your gimbal!

17:49.469 --> 17:50.737
Rooster your gimbal!

17:50.770 --> 17:52.105
What does that mean?!

17:52.139 --> 17:53.640
Pull the rope!

17:55.308 --> 17:56.809
The other rope.

17:59.446 --> 18:00.880
Homie!

18:00.913 --> 18:02.449
You came for me!

18:02.482 --> 18:04.451
And I'll never leave you.

18:04.484 --> 18:06.719
Except right now
when the wind blows me

18:06.753 --> 18:08.288
(fading):
God knows where....

18:08.321 --> 18:10.757
They're headed for a wind farm!

18:12.325 --> 18:13.593
(both gasp)

18:13.626 --> 18:16.229
BOTH:
Whoa...!

18:16.263 --> 18:17.564
(kiss)

18:17.597 --> 18:19.065
Whoa...!

18:19.098 --> 18:20.099
(kiss)

18:20.133 --> 18:22.335
Whoa...!

18:26.606 --> 18:28.975
(New England accent):
Well, Mother,
looks like we caught

18:29.008 --> 18:30.943
a couple more kiteboarders.

18:30.977 --> 18:33.780
-I'll get the big ladder.
-I'll tell the hospital

18:33.813 --> 18:36.949
their power's gonna be down
for a while.

18:38.117 --> 18:41.087
Strong woman, I love you.

18:41.120 --> 18:43.790
(exhales)
And I love you.

18:43.823 --> 18:46.926
And never again
will I listen to a doctor.

18:46.959 --> 18:49.095
Wait, that's not the takeaway.

18:49.128 --> 18:51.130
Takeaway?
That's a good idea!

18:51.164 --> 18:53.266
Yello? Pizza Palace?

18:53.300 --> 18:55.268
Can I get
a Henry the Eight-Inch Pizza

18:55.302 --> 18:56.436
with extra meat?

18:56.469 --> 18:58.805
And a side
of chocolate cheesy bread?

18:58.838 --> 19:00.006
No such thing.

19:00.039 --> 19:01.808
-Can you make it anyways?

19:06.179 --> 19:08.114
Chief, I've got to make dinner
for my kids. Could you please

19:08.147 --> 19:10.817
-tell me what this is about?
-Like most physical therapists

19:10.850 --> 19:14.787
in America, this man
is actually a Russian spy.

19:14.821 --> 19:17.156
Nigel is a spy?

19:17.190 --> 19:18.491
Dimitri Nigelovonovitch.

19:18.525 --> 19:20.960
Did you ever wonder
why he was so interested

19:20.993 --> 19:22.962
in seeing your husband at work?

19:22.995 --> 19:25.131
I thought
it was close to his house.

19:25.164 --> 19:28.301
Didn't you ever ask yourself
how a beach bum like him

19:28.335 --> 19:31.638
could afford a top-of-the-line
2007 Saturn SUV

19:31.671 --> 19:33.640
with a full spare tire?

19:33.673 --> 19:35.675
I guess I didn't want to know.

19:35.708 --> 19:40.079
Just thank God, thank God your
husband is entrapping him now.

19:41.348 --> 19:44.817
Homer, I just need
a few pictures of...

19:44.851 --> 19:46.519
the co-ah.

19:46.553 --> 19:48.488
-The what?
-Goo-ah.

19:48.521 --> 19:51.324
-The car?
-Goo-ah.

19:51.358 --> 19:53.326
Like a crow? Caw?

19:53.360 --> 19:55.161
Co-ahr-car?

19:55.194 --> 19:58.197
(Russian accent): Damn it.
Show me your reactor core.

19:58.231 --> 20:00.233
All units, move in!

20:04.203 --> 20:06.873
("Theme from
Mission: Impossible" playing)

20:14.714 --> 20:17.384

21:09.336 --> 21:11.338
