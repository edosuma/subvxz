a time limit on an initiation

nothing on Mackey.

Mackey and Vendrell were
interrogated

16:09.480 --> 16:14.235
about the shooting death
of a Detective Terry Crowley.

16:14.920 --> 16:18.549
From the notes, it's very clear
that you thought Mackey was
involved.

And your comrades
ruled it line of duty.

16:23.120 --> 16:26.749

to shed some light on the specifics.

But he's also the one
with a conscience.

I tried calling.
No one answered.

37:29.800 --> 37:30.915
Something wrong?

37:31.680 --> 37:35.116
I thought maybe I'd try to catch
them before they went to bed.

37:35.320 --> 37:37.470
Say good night.
It's not your usual night.

37:37.680 --> 37:39.193
I know.

37:39.400 --> 37:42.949
Vic, you can't just show up.
I mean, they have a schedule.

37:43.160 --> 37:45.720
Mine's always changing.
You want me to ever see
them or not?

37:45.920 --> 37:48.354
These aren't my rules.
It's the custody agreement.

37:48.560 --> 37:50.551
Oh, Jesus.

37:51.920 --> 37:53.035
Is that blood?

37:55.800 --> 37:59.236
Shit, I thought I got it all.

38:03.040 --> 38:04.712
Twelve-year-old.

38:05.240 --> 38:09.392
It's been a shit day. I just
wanted to kiss them good night.

38:12.920 --> 38:14.558
Wash it off before you see them.

38:22.400 --> 38:24.391
Hey.
Daddy.

38:27.440 --> 38:28.793

38:32.640 --> 38:35.632
Heard you already have
a suspect in custody on
that cafeteria shooting.

38:36.240 --> 38:38.913
Most cases are solved
within the first 24 hours.

38:39.120 --> 38:42.795
After that, the odds of solving them
decrease exponentially.

38:45.280 --> 38:47.350
I'm gonna learn
a lot from you, aren't I?

38:47.560 --> 38:49.152
Could be.

38:50.480 --> 38:52.869
Have a good night, detective.
You too.

38:55.800 --> 38:57.597
Relax.

38:59.200 --> 39:02.158
Gun-residue test came back
on Evan Dayne. Negative.

39:02.360 --> 39:04.351
We're sure
about this guy?

39:06.200 --> 39:08.156
He knows when
to wash his hands.

39:08.480 --> 39:10.232
So do I.

39:18.000 --> 39:19.718
We're looking
for a brother.

39:19.920 --> 39:22.593
Blond afro, tall,
hands might be cut up.

39:22.800 --> 39:25.473
Ain't seen nobody like that.
Yeah, we know he hangs here.

39:25.680 --> 39:28.114
And we know
this shop's been hit
nine times last year.

39:28.320 --> 39:29.275
RONNIE:
Twice last month.

39:29.480 --> 39:32.313
And it took you guys three hours
to show up last time I called.

39:32.520 --> 39:34.636
Well, next time...

39:36.040 --> 39:38.838
you call us. We're your new 911.

39:39.040 --> 39:41.235
We'll make sure that people
don't mess with your shop.

We steer that kind of business
someplace else.

Talking straight about
keeping my place safe?

I got a badge, don't I?

39:53.640 --> 39:56.950

Came in this morning.

Hey.

40:16.960 --> 40:20.839
Anybody,
any colour, hits this store,
I will beat them half-dead

40:21.040 --> 40:25.272
and plant enough shit on them
to send them away for a 10 stretch.

40:25.480 --> 40:27.516

Screw.

40:41.880 --> 40:44.713
Who says you gotta look
like Janet Reno, right?

40:48.480 --> 40:50.994
You replaced your breastplate
with lipstick and tampons?

40:51.200 --> 40:53.760
Well, a place to put
your shit, you know?

40:54.840 --> 40:56.353
Yeah, well,
that's a reprimand,

40:57.400 --> 40:59.277
as well as probably
getting you killed.

41:01.000 --> 41:04.390
Lose those hoop earrings
before someone rips your ears off.

41:05.160 --> 41:06.752
Did I do something
to piss you off?

41:06.960 --> 41:08.712
You know what, you have a job,
sweetheart, all right?

41:08.920 --> 41:12.230
Take it seriously.
You're a cop, not a Kelly Girl.

41:12.440 --> 41:14.237
Okay, look.

41:14.720 --> 41:17.234
I appreciate you
being straight with me.

with these guys.

41:20.040 --> 41:22.156
Treat you like you don't belong.

41:22.360 --> 41:23.839
Yeah, I know.

41:24.600 --> 41:26.636
They talk a blue streak
about equality, but the truth is

41:26.840 --> 41:30.230
the shitheads just think
we're a bunch of little girls
playing cops.

41:30.440 --> 41:34.399
So we have to prove them wrong.
Yeah, we do.

41:34.800 --> 41:37.837
Thanks. It's good
to have some backup.

You still here?

41:51.040 --> 41:53.190
I thought you were supposed
to be more 9 to 5.

41:53.400 --> 41:55.789
Thanks. Tell that to Billings.

41:56.360 --> 41:57.713
You pretty much
run the place.

41:57.920 --> 42:00.992
Yeah, I'd rather be running
the streets with you.
Hell of a lot easier.

Don't be so sure.
I got my work cut out for me.

42:05.000 --> 42:07.594

42:07.800 --> 42:10.030
Well, who is?

42:10.240 --> 42:12.674
Anyway, I wouldn't
write her off too soon.

42:12.880 --> 42:14.836
She's raw,
but she's got potential.

42:15.040 --> 42:18.112
Yeah. Guess I made a few
mistakes out there myself.

42:18.320 --> 42:19.799
DANNY:
Yeah, you still do.

42:20.000 --> 42:23.390
You're supposed to have
your DFARs on my desk
before the end of the shift.

42:23.600 --> 42:25.511
I'll get Tina right on it.

See? I did train you right.
Yep.

KAVANAUGH:
About six months ago,

46:30.600 --> 46:36.072
we found this kilo of pure heroin
in the glove compartment of your car.

46:38.520 --> 46:42.798
We seized the drugs,
documented it on camera

46:43.000 --> 46:46.470
and replaced it with dummy tar.

46:47.360 --> 46:48.793
But...

46:49.360 --> 46:51.032
you never logged it
into evidence.

Look, if you were arresting me,
we'd be at Police 1,
