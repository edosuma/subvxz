00:01.768 --> 00:06.338
(matt mays'
"madre padre" playing)

00:06.340 --> 00:09.008
Hey! Ian!

00:09.010 --> 00:10.309
Ian, what are you doing!

00:10.311 --> 00:12.611
Ian! Hey!
(horns honking)

00:12.613 --> 00:14.346
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa.

00:14.348 --> 00:15.414
Whoa!

00:15.416 --> 00:17.683
(horns blaring)

00:17.685 --> 00:18.751
Ian--stop.

00:18.753 --> 00:20.352
Ian, what are you
doing, man?

00:20.354 --> 00:22.021
What are you--
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

00:22.023 --> 00:24.256
What are you doing?
Are you okay?

00:24.258 --> 00:25.491
Let's go.

00:25.493 --> 00:27.659
Hey, stop, please. Jeez.
(tires screech)

00:27.661 --> 00:29.294
(horn blares)

00:29.296 --> 00:31.263
All right, you okay?

00:31.265 --> 00:34.099
What are you thinking?

00:34.101 --> 00:37.302
All right, let's, um...
(exhales)

00:37.304 --> 00:39.471
Let's get you off
your feet.

00:39.473 --> 00:41.340
Don't want anymore damage
to that ankle, right?

00:41.342 --> 00:43.609
Got that, buddy?
Got that?

00:43.611 --> 00:45.044
(groans)

00:45.046 --> 00:55.120
â™ª

01:00.627 --> 01:02.361
Hurts like heck.

01:02.363 --> 01:04.563
Add 5 milligrams
of morphine, jackson.

01:04.565 --> 01:07.599
Thank you. Thank you.

01:07.601 --> 01:09.068
So you have no memory
whatsoever

01:09.070 --> 01:10.736
Wandering
into traffic like that?

01:10.738 --> 01:14.706
Mnh-mnh. I must've been groggy
from the surgery.

01:14.708 --> 01:17.209
I'm just amazed you weren't
hit by a car out there.

01:17.211 --> 01:20.679
0.3 percent of patients
are injured while in hospital.

01:20.681 --> 01:22.548
Yeah. Ian's an actuary,
by the way.

01:22.550 --> 01:23.782
Uh, you work in insurance?

01:23.784 --> 01:26.652
Uh, I calculate odds
for a living,

01:26.654 --> 01:28.353
Mostly for insurance
companies.

01:28.355 --> 01:29.755
Oh, you mean like how long
people live if they smoke?

01:29.757 --> 01:31.090
Stuff like that?

01:31.092 --> 01:34.860
Being an actuary's kind of like
being a cross between

01:34.862 --> 01:37.229
An undertaker and a booker.
(inhales sharply)

01:37.231 --> 01:39.765
Ooh!
Okay, you have really
cracked this plate

01:39.767 --> 01:41.633
That I put
in your ankle here.

01:41.635 --> 01:43.235
This may hurt a little bit.

01:43.237 --> 01:44.770
Thank you, jackson.
Uh, go ahead.

01:44.772 --> 01:46.205
Ask me anything.
I'll tell you how likely

01:46.207 --> 01:47.739
It is it'll happen to you.

01:47.741 --> 01:48.874
Getting bit by a snake.

01:48.876 --> 01:50.442
More people are killed
by lightning.

01:50.444 --> 01:51.510
I wouldn't worry about it.

01:51.512 --> 01:52.744
I like this guy.
He's good.

01:52.746 --> 01:57.483
Odds of getting back together
with your ex-girlfriend.

01:57.485 --> 01:58.884
Why would you even ask...

01:58.886 --> 02:01.653
How would you describe
your sexual chemistry?

02:01.655 --> 02:03.755
Why are you asking me
the question?

02:03.757 --> 02:05.224
It's his question.

02:05.226 --> 02:07.493
How would you describe
their sexual chemistry?

02:07.495 --> 02:08.494
Eh, it's hot.

02:08.496 --> 02:10.562
Jackson!

02:10.564 --> 02:15.501
(alex breathes heavily)

02:15.503 --> 02:17.703
Hey...

02:17.705 --> 02:19.771
Alex?

02:19.773 --> 02:22.574
You okay?

02:22.576 --> 02:25.177
Fine.

02:25.179 --> 02:27.379
Are you having
a panic attack?

02:27.381 --> 02:30.415
No, I just... I need to, uh,

02:30.417 --> 02:32.918
I just need to sit here
for a second.

02:32.920 --> 02:34.887
Your pulse feels like a rat
trapped in a wall.

02:34.889 --> 02:36.421
A rat just needs a bagel.

02:36.423 --> 02:38.690
No, you're in a-fib,
alex.

02:38.692 --> 02:42.294
What?

02:42.296 --> 02:44.530
You're in sinus rhythm.

02:44.532 --> 02:45.597
It's normal.

02:45.599 --> 02:47.366
Good, then we're done.

02:47.368 --> 02:48.400
Not so fast.

02:48.402 --> 02:51.403
Like you've had an episode
of atrial fibrillation.

02:51.405 --> 02:52.905
Which can be anything.

02:52.907 --> 02:55.440
Or it can lead to a stroke,
hypotension, or cardiac arrest.

02:55.442 --> 02:57.876
I think I'd know if
I had a heart arrhythmia, dawn.

02:57.878 --> 02:59.845
Clearly not. Coffee?

02:59.847 --> 03:02.447
Two or three cups a day.
Alex...

03:02.449 --> 03:04.416
Okay, four.
So eight?

03:04.418 --> 03:06.385
Mm, you gotta double it.
Everyone lies.

03:06.387 --> 03:07.486
Alcohol?

03:07.488 --> 03:11.223
Glass of wine after work.
Maybe two.

03:11.225 --> 03:12.724
Lately two.

03:12.726 --> 03:14.660
Coffee could be a factor.

03:14.662 --> 03:16.261
Undo your top two buttons.

03:16.263 --> 03:18.697
I had a dream
about this once.

03:18.699 --> 03:20.532
Too soon.
Agreed.

03:20.534 --> 03:24.903
Okay, I'm going to fit you
with a heart monitor.

03:24.905 --> 03:27.606
You need to wear it
for 48 hours,

03:27.608 --> 03:30.242
And your e.C.G. Is gonna be
beamed directly to me.

03:30.244 --> 03:32.544
And we're gonna figure out
what this is, okay?

03:32.546 --> 03:34.379
Oh, and charlie,
there's something that

03:34.381 --> 03:35.647
I need to talk
to you about.

03:35.649 --> 03:37.449
Can I work
with this thing on?

03:37.451 --> 03:39.484
I don't know. Can you?

03:43.656 --> 03:45.290
Whoa.

03:45.292 --> 03:46.992
Charlie did get
the better of you, huh?

03:46.994 --> 03:48.760
I wouldn't say
got the better of me.

03:48.762 --> 03:50.862
Where I come from
it's called a sucker punch.

03:50.864 --> 03:52.497
Yeah, we're all
just a little surprised

03:52.499 --> 03:55.267
I do know self-defense,
as a matter of fact.

03:55.269 --> 03:56.435
There's a little thing

03:56.437 --> 03:57.636
I like to call restraint,
dr. Miller.

03:57.638 --> 03:59.238
Why? What are people
saying about me?

03:59.240 --> 04:01.473
Oh, nothing really.
Just kind of, you know...

04:01.475 --> 04:03.008
Can't believe that you
lost the fight.

04:03.010 --> 04:04.776
I didn't <i>lose</i> the fight.

04:04.778 --> 04:06.278
That's not what happened.

04:06.280 --> 04:09.381
Oh, well, well--well,
what did happen?

04:09.383 --> 04:10.682
If you must know,
alex walked in

04:10.684 --> 04:12.284
Before I got a chance
to take a shot at the guy.

04:12.286 --> 04:13.485
See, that's exactly
what I heard--

04:13.487 --> 04:14.686
That charlie caught
you guys making out.

04:14.688 --> 04:16.655
He did not catch us
making out.

04:16.657 --> 04:18.523
Mm, caught you guys
in bed together.
He didn't catch us
in bed together.

04:18.525 --> 04:19.791
Where did you get that from?
That's new information.

04:19.793 --> 04:21.493
Did you see how I just
easily took that from you?

04:21.495 --> 04:23.262
Zach, do you want me
to hit you right now?

04:23.264 --> 04:24.529
'cause I'm feeling
the temptation grow.

04:24.531 --> 04:25.597
You seem upset.

04:25.599 --> 04:26.698
I feel inconvenienced.

04:26.700 --> 04:29.768
(lowered voice) I do wish
I'd hit him back, yeah.
(whispers) I know.

04:29.770 --> 04:32.938
Well, when one doctor
hits another doctor, charlie,

04:32.940 --> 04:34.640
That's what we do.

04:34.642 --> 04:36.541
Uh, well, I hit him
as a private citizen,

04:36.543 --> 04:37.943
So we don't
have to do this.

04:37.945 --> 04:39.044
But you hit him
in the hospital,

04:39.046 --> 04:41.613
I'm not going
to anger management, dawn.

04:41.615 --> 04:42.948
Conflict resolution.

04:42.950 --> 04:44.916
Whatever it's called,
I'm not doing it.

04:44.918 --> 04:46.785
Well, then, I'm not
gonna let you operate.

04:46.787 --> 04:48.520
What?

04:48.522 --> 04:51.723
Till gavin signs this form
certifying that

04:51.725 --> 04:53.492
You have gone
to conflict resolution,

04:53.494 --> 04:54.926
I'm not letting you work.

04:54.928 --> 04:56.495
That is ridiculous.

04:56.497 --> 04:58.463
I can't take the risk
of the surgical department

04:58.465 --> 04:59.798
Getting sued
because you decide

04:59.800 --> 05:01.433
That you're gonna
clock a patient.

05:01.435 --> 05:03.502
I'm not gonna hit a patient,
dawn. You know that.

05:03.504 --> 05:05.504
Don't make me do this.

05:05.506 --> 05:07.005
You're doin' it.

05:07.007 --> 05:08.407
(telephone rings)

05:08.409 --> 05:11.076
(siren wailing in distance)

05:11.078 --> 05:12.811
(paper rustles)

05:17.617 --> 05:20.352
It's probably just
a stress-induced arrhythmia.
Yowch.

05:20.354 --> 05:22.087
Who hooked you up
to the homing device?

05:22.089 --> 05:23.655
(sighs) dawn.
Double yowch.

05:23.657 --> 05:26.325
Well, at least
she's not benching you.
No, I guess.

05:26.327 --> 05:28.627
Not to add more stress
to your day, but...
What?

05:28.629 --> 05:30.062
Old friend is here
to see you.

05:30.064 --> 05:32.030
(spanish accent)
<i>buenos dÃ­as, dr. Reid.</i>

05:32.032 --> 05:34.066
Randall,
where have you been?

05:34.068 --> 05:36.034
MÃ©xico.

05:36.036 --> 05:37.069
(chuckles)

05:37.071 --> 05:40.839
Oh! (groaning)

05:40.841 --> 05:42.507
<i>Para usted.</i>

05:42.509 --> 05:44.509
(normal voice)
do not eat the worm.

05:44.511 --> 05:45.510
Give you visions.

05:45.512 --> 05:47.879
Mescal. My favorite.
Thank you.

05:47.881 --> 05:49.915
You know, I had a premonition
I'd see you here today.

05:49.917 --> 05:52.017
I work here. That's not
exactly a premonition.

05:52.019 --> 05:53.852
So what can we do
for you today?

05:53.854 --> 05:56.855
Your favorite psychic
appears to have a hernia.

05:56.857 --> 05:58.957
Okay, let's get him
into imaging.

05:58.959 --> 06:01.793
Yeah, but he has pancreatic
cancer and he's jaundiced.

06:01.795 --> 06:03.028
It's mostly tan.

06:03.030 --> 06:05.697
I'm worried the tumor's
obstructing the bile duct,

06:05.699 --> 06:06.998
Which we also have
to deal with.

06:07.000 --> 06:09.534
We need an m.R.I.
For the bile duct.

06:09.536 --> 06:11.002
Yeah, that's the problem.

06:11.004 --> 06:12.137
(objects clatter)

06:12.139 --> 06:14.439
What are you doin'?
You'll see.

06:14.441 --> 06:15.440
Eh, not today.

06:15.442 --> 06:17.542
She, uh,
she has an arrhythmia.

06:17.544 --> 06:18.910
What? That sounds bad.

06:18.912 --> 06:21.646
It does but this is gonna
put a smile on your face.

06:21.648 --> 06:23.515
You're sure
this is cool, right?

06:23.517 --> 06:24.583
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

06:24.585 --> 06:25.784
Okay, pull that up.

06:25.786 --> 06:29.054
Ready?

06:29.056 --> 06:30.088
(alex) what?

06:30.090 --> 06:31.690
Whoa.
Huh?

06:31.692 --> 06:33.091
Magnets?

06:33.093 --> 06:35.494
See?
Okay, you have magnets
in your stomach.

06:35.496 --> 06:36.561
Problem?

06:36.563 --> 06:38.029
If we put you in an m.R.I.,

06:38.031 --> 06:39.765
The magnetic forces
are gonna collide and...

06:39.767 --> 06:41.600
And basically rip him
in two.

06:41.602 --> 06:45.604
(singsongy) I'm back.

06:48.809 --> 06:55.013
(spanish accent) doctors
rubio cortestiza <i>y</i> guzman.

06:55.015 --> 06:57.416
(normal voice) I did some, uh,
alternative therapy

06:57.418 --> 07:00.585
With them
at their clinic in tijuana.

07:00.587 --> 07:03.955
See, the magnets interact
with the nanoparticles,

07:03.957 --> 07:06.825
Reducing the size
of the cancer tumors.

07:06.827 --> 07:08.427
That's unbelievable.

07:08.429 --> 07:10.996
I know,
but it sounds crazy.

07:10.998 --> 07:12.497
That's because
it <i>is</i> crazy.

07:12.499 --> 07:14.065
Those border clinics
are clip joints, randall.

07:14.067 --> 07:15.200
They just want
your money.

07:15.202 --> 07:18.103
(magnets clatter)

07:18.105 --> 07:19.571
Last one.

07:19.573 --> 07:21.072
You know, not everything

07:21.074 --> 07:24.976
Could be explained away
with reason, doctor.

07:24.978 --> 07:26.511
Buddy of mine told me
about this place.

07:26.513 --> 07:30.982
I'm feeling good.
I am feeling really good.

07:30.984 --> 07:33.952
Maggie, why don't you
try to reduce it now?

07:33.954 --> 07:35.687
What? What do you mean
reduce it?

07:35.689 --> 07:38.056
We're gonna try
and push the hernia back in.

07:38.058 --> 07:40.091
Why? Is that a good idea?

07:40.093 --> 07:42.861
You might feel
some discomfort.

07:42.863 --> 07:44.162
Maggie, press gently.

07:44.164 --> 07:45.163
Okay.

07:45.165 --> 07:47.632
(groaning)

07:47.634 --> 07:50.135
Okay.
I think he's pushing
his stomach muscles out.

07:50.137 --> 07:53.638
Okay, let me try.

07:53.640 --> 07:54.706
Your hernia's
incarcerated,

07:54.708 --> 07:57.175
Are trapped outside
the abdominal wall.

07:57.177 --> 08:00.078
So, what--wh--what
does that mean?

08:00.080 --> 08:01.580
I need surgery?

08:01.582 --> 08:02.948
You might,
but given your cancer,

08:02.950 --> 08:05.550
And then try to reduce it
again later.

08:05.552 --> 08:06.785
We'll get you
that m.R.I.,

08:06.787 --> 08:08.220
And then we'll have
to admit you.

08:08.222 --> 08:09.821
Can you bring him
up to imaging?

08:09.823 --> 08:11.690
Mm-hmm.

08:15.561 --> 08:17.796
Randall, is there someone
we can call?

08:17.798 --> 08:20.565
You know my situation,
doc.

08:20.567 --> 08:22.834
Okay.

08:31.110 --> 08:32.611
(charlie) gavin!

08:32.613 --> 08:35.213
I need you to sign this
ridiculous form for me,

08:35.215 --> 08:36.982
(paper thuds)
so I can get back
to work.

08:36.984 --> 08:40.018
(paper rustles)

08:40.020 --> 08:41.786
You haven't done
conflict resolution.

08:41.788 --> 08:42.954
No.

08:42.956 --> 08:44.789
So I can't sign
this form.

08:44.791 --> 08:48.760
Joel and I had a conflict,
I punched him,

08:48.762 --> 08:50.529
The conflict is resolved.

08:50.531 --> 08:52.130
It's not that simple.

08:52.132 --> 08:55.967
Okay, I've got 15 minutes.
Conflict resolve me,

08:55.969 --> 08:58.570
Charlie, I don't
have time right now.

08:58.572 --> 08:59.671
Okay, when?

08:59.673 --> 09:01.106
You can meet me at 11:00.

09:01.108 --> 09:02.107
Great.

09:02.109 --> 09:03.174
Great.

09:03.176 --> 09:04.242
I'll see you in group.

09:04.244 --> 09:07.579
Great. What?

09:07.581 --> 09:09.781
Did you say group?

09:11.951 --> 09:14.119
Hey.
Hi.

09:14.121 --> 09:15.720
What's that?

09:15.722 --> 09:18.557
I'm a robot, joel.
That's my big secret.

09:18.559 --> 09:22.594
I have a stupid arrhythmia.
I don't wanna talk about it.

09:22.596 --> 09:24.296
(under breath) okay.

09:24.298 --> 09:25.697
What?

09:25.699 --> 09:27.098
I have a busted face,

09:27.100 --> 09:28.133
You are wearing
a heart monitor,

09:28.135 --> 09:30.168
You wanna talk about
any of these things?

09:30.170 --> 09:31.836
(bell dings)

09:31.838 --> 09:33.171
Joel.
(beeping)

09:33.173 --> 09:37.075
Alex.

09:37.077 --> 09:39.177
(whispers) alex, alex!

09:39.179 --> 09:43.281
Your tracings are going...
(singsongy) a little crazy.

09:43.283 --> 09:44.616
Nice try.
(beeping continues)

09:44.618 --> 09:46.751
Oh, great. Graffiti.

09:46.753 --> 09:49.588
Nerd graffiti.

09:49.590 --> 09:53.091
(monitor beeping steadily)

09:53.093 --> 09:54.960
Randall?

09:54.962 --> 09:56.027
Hi.

09:56.029 --> 09:57.128
Hi.

09:57.130 --> 09:58.797
We got your m.R.I. Back.

09:58.799 --> 10:00.265
There's some sludge
in your bile duct.

10:00.267 --> 10:01.366
But, uh, the good news is,

10:01.368 --> 10:03.068
It's not
completely obstructed.

10:03.070 --> 10:05.937
However, there is some
bad news.

10:05.939 --> 10:09.841
(chuckles) hi! Hi!
That's so great.

10:09.843 --> 10:11.876
Wow, the nurses gave you
some pain meds, huh?

10:11.878 --> 10:15.981
Pfft, yeah.
I have a button.

10:15.983 --> 10:17.849
Yes, you do.

10:17.851 --> 10:20.385
This is so off--
I am so off the wagon.

10:20.387 --> 10:21.953
Oh, randall.

10:21.955 --> 10:24.889
It's okay, it's okay.
Hey, do you know how to watusi?

10:24.891 --> 10:26.224
No.
No? Okay.

10:26.226 --> 10:28.126
You throw your arms back

10:28.128 --> 10:29.861
Like there's a bee
in your sleeve,

10:29.863 --> 10:32.998
And you watusi.

10:33.000 --> 10:36.001
You know your grandma crane
was a dance hall champion?

10:36.003 --> 10:38.837
No.
No, you did not.
Again with the no.

10:38.839 --> 10:42.007
See, these are the things
I wanna pass down to you.

10:42.009 --> 10:44.242
I came to see if you
needed backup,

10:44.244 --> 10:47.045
But randall you seem... Fine.

10:49.281 --> 10:50.982
He's pretty out of it.

10:50.984 --> 10:53.418
I think he thinks
I'm his daughter.

10:53.420 --> 10:55.820
Great randall
has a daughter?

10:55.822 --> 10:57.756
Yeah,
they're estranged.

10:57.758 --> 11:02.093
(monitor beeping steadily)

11:02.095 --> 11:03.128
Hey.

11:03.130 --> 11:04.262
Yeah.

11:04.264 --> 11:05.830
I need your wallet.

11:05.832 --> 11:07.265
Yes, sweetie.

11:07.267 --> 11:10.068
I always have a fiver
for ice cream.

11:10.070 --> 11:12.037
(maggie) are we going
for ice cream?

11:12.039 --> 11:15.240
No, he keeps
her phone number on him.

11:15.242 --> 11:16.374
I love you.

11:16.376 --> 11:17.709
I love you.

11:17.711 --> 11:19.010
That's nice.

11:19.012 --> 11:21.379
Hey, randall.
I'm gonna call leslie.

11:21.381 --> 11:23.415
Yeah.

11:23.417 --> 11:26.384
'cause I'm dying...

11:26.386 --> 11:27.686
â™ª again

11:27.688 --> 11:31.322
â™ª it looks like

11:31.324 --> 11:35.460
â™ª I'm dying again

11:35.462 --> 11:38.763
(monitor beeping continuously)

11:43.335 --> 11:48.306
Kat, have you seen
my patient, mr. Taft?

11:48.308 --> 11:49.741
The gentleman
with the bad ankle.

11:49.743 --> 11:52.143
What do you mean
you haven't seen him?

11:52.145 --> 11:54.312
He hasn't been here.
Hasn't been here.

11:54.314 --> 11:57.949
Awesome. So someone
just let him wander off.

12:26.746 --> 12:27.879
Hey.

12:27.881 --> 12:29.948
Ian?

12:36.288 --> 12:37.822
He's not bothering you
is he, reycraft?

12:37.824 --> 12:38.957
Nope.
Awesome,

12:38.959 --> 12:40.458
Because he is a patient,

12:40.460 --> 12:42.093
Sleepwalking on
a badly broken ankle,

12:42.095 --> 12:43.495
Writing on
a doctor's lounge room wall.

12:43.497 --> 12:44.896
Yep, I see that.

12:44.898 --> 12:45.964
Sleepwalking.

12:45.966 --> 12:48.333
Yeah, his eyes are open.
Freaky.

12:48.335 --> 12:49.434
Doesn't concern you
at all?

12:49.436 --> 12:50.435
No.
No.

12:50.437 --> 12:51.870
My sister sleepwalks.

12:51.872 --> 12:54.873
She drove a car to hamilton.
He does mathematics.

12:54.875 --> 12:56.107
Oh, he's an actuary.

12:56.109 --> 12:57.142
Ooh, that sucks.

12:57.144 --> 12:59.010
Doing your job
in your sleep?

12:59.012 --> 13:01.880
He's putting way too much
pressure on that ankle.

13:01.882 --> 13:03.381
Yeah, you're right.
Okay.

13:03.383 --> 13:04.816
Should we wake him up?

13:04.818 --> 13:07.018
No. Bad news to startle
a sleepwalker.

13:07.020 --> 13:08.119
Is it really bad news?
It's bad news.

13:08.121 --> 13:09.187
I thought it was a myth.
Come on.

13:09.189 --> 13:11.156
Ian...

13:11.158 --> 13:12.190
(whispers) joel.
Ian.

13:12.192 --> 13:14.392
What?
Ian, hey, man.

13:14.394 --> 13:17.262
(screaming)
whoa, whoa, whoa.

13:17.264 --> 13:18.463
Hey, hey, hey!
Stop it!

13:18.465 --> 13:20.431
Ian, ian, ian.
It's okay, hey, it's okay.

13:20.433 --> 13:22.567
It's okay. You're sleeping.
You were sleeping.

13:22.569 --> 13:23.835
You were sleeping.
It's--yeah, yeah, that's it.

13:23.837 --> 13:24.869
Give me the chair.

13:24.871 --> 13:25.904
Give me the chair.
That's it.

13:25.906 --> 13:28.139
Just turn around slowly.
That's it.

13:28.141 --> 13:29.474
(groaning)

13:29.476 --> 13:31.843
Bad news.
Okay?

13:37.950 --> 13:39.317
(joel)
cortical screw, please.

13:39.319 --> 13:42.921
40? What, are you planning
on screwing him to the table?

13:42.923 --> 13:43.922
If he continues
to sleepwalk,

13:43.924 --> 13:45.390
We might just have to.

13:45.392 --> 13:47.158
(george)
I'm sure the sleepwalking

13:47.160 --> 13:49.561
Was just a reaction to
the sedative I gave him post-op.

13:49.563 --> 13:51.429
It's a known side effect
of zolpidem.

13:51.431 --> 13:53.464
(joel) so why'd we give it
to him? Scalpel.

13:53.466 --> 13:56.067
Because he's in a hospital,
in a controlled environment,

13:56.069 --> 13:58.169
Where patients are supposed
to be monitored.

13:58.171 --> 13:59.971
That's right.
Blame the nurses.

13:59.973 --> 14:02.907
Hand me a centrally
threaded steinmann, on power.

14:02.909 --> 14:04.309
Thank you.

14:08.380 --> 14:11.482
(drill whirring)

14:14.119 --> 14:16.087
I used to walk in my sleep
when I was a kid.
(whirring stops)

14:16.089 --> 14:18.489
Used to do mathematic
equations like ian here?

14:18.491 --> 14:21.025
No, but I did pee
on my brother's bed once.

14:21.027 --> 14:23.394
I sincerely hope
he wasn't in it at the time.

14:23.396 --> 14:25.630
(monitor beeping steadily)

14:25.632 --> 14:28.933
I have more contact
with the patients!

14:28.935 --> 14:31.970
I... Went
to medical... School.

14:31.972 --> 14:35.340
That... Doesn't make
you... A god!

14:35.342 --> 14:38.543
It does... In the
o... R.

14:38.545 --> 14:41.646
Yes, great. Thank you.
Good work, guys.

14:41.648 --> 14:44.315
Uh, wow.
This is a waste of time.

14:44.317 --> 14:46.584
I should be out
doing my job,

14:46.586 --> 14:49.187
Like saving lives,
for instance.

14:49.189 --> 14:51.589
(shahir) saving lives?
You just save legs, charlie.

14:51.591 --> 14:52.924
You're an orthopod.

14:52.926 --> 14:54.525
It's water off
a duck's back, shahir.

14:54.527 --> 14:56.561
Because I do not
have anger issues.

14:56.563 --> 14:58.196
Charlie?

14:58.198 --> 14:59.931
No, I'm--I'm taking
the set off.

14:59.933 --> 15:01.199
I've got this...
Tennis elbow thing.

15:01.201 --> 15:04.202
Point of this is getting you
out of your comfort zone.

15:04.204 --> 15:06.337
I'm very uncomfortable
right now.

15:06.339 --> 15:08.172
Everybody gets angry, charlie.

15:08.174 --> 15:10.275
This is a safe place
for us to let it out,

15:10.277 --> 15:12.310
See if we can't get
to the root cause

15:12.312 --> 15:14.646
Of what is making us angry.

15:17.416 --> 15:18.449
So let's review.

15:18.451 --> 15:21.486
Um, what are the stages
of anger?

15:21.488 --> 15:22.587
Demanding.

15:22.589 --> 15:24.088
I must have my way.

15:24.090 --> 15:29.494
You, it, or they are in the way
of me getting what I want.

15:29.496 --> 15:30.595
Then blame.

15:30.597 --> 15:33.097
You are not giving me
what I want.

15:33.099 --> 15:37.368
You deserve to be punished,
and I'm gonna punish you.

15:37.370 --> 15:38.369
(fist thuds)

15:38.371 --> 15:39.671
(cell phone chimes)

15:39.673 --> 15:41.306
O.R.

15:41.308 --> 15:42.507
Okay.

15:42.509 --> 15:45.610
Uh, wait a second. Wait.
He gets to leave?

15:45.612 --> 15:47.578
It's a medical emergency.

15:47.580 --> 15:49.514
(door opens)

15:49.516 --> 15:51.616
Okay.
(door closes)

15:51.618 --> 15:55.019
Gavin, I lost my temper.

15:55.021 --> 15:58.656
And I will not deny
that there are some things

15:58.658 --> 16:02.493
To get sorted out
between myself... And joel.

16:02.495 --> 16:05.430
However, he's not here
right now.

16:05.432 --> 16:08.299
Okay. Then I'll be joel.

16:08.301 --> 16:10.335
You're not joel.

16:10.337 --> 16:17.275
(imitates new zealand accent)
yes, I am... Mate.

16:19.345 --> 16:22.146
I walked around
the parking lot three times

16:22.148 --> 16:23.715
Before coming in here.

16:23.717 --> 16:25.316
You walked
through the door.

16:25.318 --> 16:28.252
Yeah, 'cause I'd look
like a lunatic.

16:28.254 --> 16:30.188
Your dad'll be happy
you're here.

16:30.190 --> 16:34.225
I don't really
call him dad.

16:34.227 --> 16:37.095
<i>(man) â™ª drifting heart</i>

16:37.097 --> 16:40.331
<i>â™ª there are many hearts</i>
<i>like mine â™ª</i>

16:40.333 --> 16:45.603
I don't know why I got this
watusi stuck in...

16:45.605 --> 16:47.472
<i>â™ª oh, why should I</i>

16:47.474 --> 16:49.107
<i>â™ª feel so lonely</i>

16:49.109 --> 16:50.174
Leslie.

16:50.176 --> 16:52.243
Hi, randall.

16:52.245 --> 16:53.644
What are you doin' here?

16:53.646 --> 16:56.280
How are you?

16:56.282 --> 16:59.584
Fine.

17:01.420 --> 17:02.653
(music stops)

17:04.523 --> 17:06.290
H-how's bobby and...

17:06.292 --> 17:07.358
(leslie) no.
No.

17:07.360 --> 17:10.194
Um... Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Brian.

17:10.196 --> 17:11.596
No, I'm--I'm single.

17:11.598 --> 17:12.697
Oh.

17:12.699 --> 17:13.698
I didn't remember.

17:13.700 --> 17:15.333
(chuckles)

17:15.335 --> 17:18.036
But you're okay? Single?

17:18.038 --> 17:20.204
Yeah, it's fine.

17:20.206 --> 17:24.742
Look exactly like you did
last time I saw you.

17:24.744 --> 17:28.046
Uh, that was 10 years ago.

17:28.048 --> 17:30.214
I was wearing skater pants
and a pound of eyeliner.

17:30.216 --> 17:31.816
So I've--I've changed.

17:34.286 --> 17:35.820
Randall,
leslie is here today

17:35.822 --> 17:38.723
Because you need to talk
with family about your options.

17:38.725 --> 17:40.591
What options?

17:40.593 --> 17:43.127
Your imaging showed
new metastases.

17:43.129 --> 17:47.198
Oh. More cancer.
Alert the media.

17:47.200 --> 17:49.400
(laughs)

17:49.402 --> 17:51.269
You need to talk
about pain management,

17:51.271 --> 17:54.472
And I know that you think
you can take care of yourself,

17:54.474 --> 17:55.740
But I don't think
you can.

17:55.742 --> 17:58.342
Um, uh, okay, I'm sorry.
I'm kinda new to this.

17:58.344 --> 17:59.610
What exactly should we
be talking about?

17:59.612 --> 18:00.611
I'm not even...

18:00.613 --> 18:02.346
(gasps)

18:02.348 --> 18:05.817
(whispers) stupid...
It's okay.

18:05.819 --> 18:07.585
(groaning)

18:07.587 --> 18:09.687
Pain is worse?

18:09.689 --> 18:11.189
All right, it looks like

18:11.191 --> 18:13.491
You're losing blood supply
to your bowel.

18:13.493 --> 18:16.360
I'm worried that
your hernia is strangulated,

18:16.362 --> 18:18.362
Which means that
it's cutting off blood supply

18:18.364 --> 18:20.264
To your intestines,
and you could go septic.

18:20.266 --> 18:21.732
So I need to do
a surgery right now.

18:21.734 --> 18:23.334
Wait, what,
I-I-I didn't know

18:23.336 --> 18:24.335
He was having surgery.

18:24.337 --> 18:25.636
How long
is that gonna take?

18:25.638 --> 18:26.771
Everything goes well,

18:26.773 --> 18:28.539
It shouldn't take
more than an hour.

18:31.277 --> 18:35.646
(voice breaks) well,
I don't know. I don't know.

18:39.118 --> 18:41.119
Stop it. (laughs)

18:41.121 --> 18:42.186
It's the lizard.

18:42.188 --> 18:43.654
(voice breaking)
it's not funny.

18:43.656 --> 18:45.623
I'm too old for the lizard,
randall.

18:45.625 --> 18:47.558
You're not too old.

18:47.560 --> 18:49.293
I'm--okay, I'll be here.

18:49.295 --> 18:50.495
Stop.

18:50.497 --> 18:52.497
I will be here.

18:52.499 --> 18:54.765
(groans)

18:54.767 --> 18:56.501
(continues imitating joel)
charlie, mate,

18:56.503 --> 18:59.237
What is it about me
that you find so threatening?

18:59.239 --> 19:01.405
That doesn't sound anything
like joel.

19:01.407 --> 19:03.908
Really? I-I think
it's quite good.

19:03.910 --> 19:05.610
Gavin, can you do me?

19:05.612 --> 19:08.479
Not really the time.
But, um...

19:08.481 --> 19:09.881
(southeast asian accent)
gavin, I have anger issues.

19:09.883 --> 19:11.916
I am really angry
and I fix brains.

19:11.918 --> 19:13.384
He's amazing.

19:13.386 --> 19:15.887
Okay, um, anything I needed
to say to joel,

19:15.889 --> 19:18.289
I already said...
With my fist.

19:18.291 --> 19:21.159
Violence denotes poor conflict
resolution skills, charlie.

19:21.161 --> 19:23.227
No, no, actually, um,
sports have taught me

19:23.229 --> 19:24.695
That the right amount of anger

19:24.697 --> 19:27.231
Directed at the right person
or thing for the right reason

19:27.233 --> 19:31.169
At the right time
is actually quite constructive.

19:31.171 --> 19:33.738
Besides, he brought it
on himself.

19:33.740 --> 19:34.805
That's blame.

19:34.807 --> 19:38.843
Listen to yourself.
You're making it joel's fault.

19:38.845 --> 19:40.278
He insulted alex.

19:40.280 --> 19:41.779
So you punished him.
He deserved it.

19:41.781 --> 19:43.581
What did he do?
What difference
does it make?

19:43.583 --> 19:44.782
Well, it really
pissed you off.

19:44.784 --> 19:45.917
Yeah, it did.

19:45.919 --> 19:47.418
Is joel an obstacle
to what you want?

19:47.420 --> 19:48.586
Like what?
Dr. Reid.

19:48.588 --> 19:50.955
I didn't... Say that!

19:53.859 --> 19:55.493
(cell phone vibrates)

19:55.495 --> 19:57.895
Hey, look at that.
I got a page.

19:57.897 --> 20:00.598
Oh, I gotta go.
Good luck, charlie.

20:00.600 --> 20:03.267
(clears throat)

20:03.269 --> 20:06.370
(door opens and closes)

20:08.540 --> 20:09.807
He gets to leave, too?

20:09.809 --> 20:11.776
He doesn't really
have to be here.

20:11.778 --> 20:13.211
He just likes it.

20:14.880 --> 20:16.581
(racket clatters)

20:16.583 --> 20:19.984
Hey, I forgot to ask you.
How's charlie?

20:23.655 --> 20:25.356
Are you two splitsville?

20:25.358 --> 20:26.824
He left.

20:26.826 --> 20:29.293
He say why?

20:29.295 --> 20:31.229
You're not gonna
believe this.

20:31.231 --> 20:33.598
Actually, you might be the only
person that <i>does</i> believe this.

20:33.600 --> 20:35.933
(sighs) he sees ghosts.

20:35.935 --> 20:36.968
He told you?

20:36.970 --> 20:38.369
He didn't have to.

20:38.371 --> 20:42.006
Oh, just that when
he woke up from this coma

20:42.008 --> 20:43.641
He, uh, had this thing.

20:43.643 --> 20:45.610
And what did you say?

20:45.612 --> 20:49.747
(sighs) I said it would
destroy his life.

20:49.749 --> 20:51.582
(exhales) I just need
a minute.

20:54.519 --> 20:56.487
You okay, doc?

20:56.489 --> 20:58.889
Yeah, it's nothing
just a heart flutter.

20:58.891 --> 21:02.393
How about a big black bird
of anger is fluttering

21:02.395 --> 21:04.395
In your chest
and you can't breathe.

21:04.397 --> 21:08.299
Did you open a full
laparotomy tray?

21:08.301 --> 21:09.767
Yep, and there's
an omni-retractor in there

21:09.769 --> 21:10.901
Just in case you need it.

21:10.903 --> 21:12.036
Thanks.
You're welcome.

21:12.038 --> 21:13.604
Hey.
Yes?

21:13.606 --> 21:14.905
Give him another chance.

21:14.907 --> 21:16.040
<i>He</i> left <i>me.</i>

21:16.042 --> 21:17.341
I know.

21:17.343 --> 21:19.443
But the first time
I saw you,

21:19.445 --> 21:22.546
Your chakras were clear.
And now they're muddy.

21:22.548 --> 21:24.682
It means
your spirit's dying.

21:24.684 --> 21:25.950
Randall...
Hey!

21:25.952 --> 21:27.785
I'm just telling you
what I see.

21:27.787 --> 21:30.588
Can you take him in?

21:30.590 --> 21:31.822
Sure.

21:35.861 --> 21:38.296
You know I saw
your stage show five times?

21:38.298 --> 21:39.664
Really?
Mm-hmm.

21:39.666 --> 21:40.765
How was I?

21:40.767 --> 21:41.799
Hypnotic.

21:41.801 --> 21:44.735
(randall)
good. (chuckles)

21:44.737 --> 21:46.370
What's your favorite part?

21:46.372 --> 21:49.473
(woman speaking indistinctly)

21:58.650 --> 22:00.318
(cell phone buzzes)

22:00.320 --> 22:03.387
(sighs) come on.
(buzz)

22:03.389 --> 22:05.356
Yep?
Did your heart stop?

22:05.358 --> 22:06.390
No.

22:06.392 --> 22:07.525
Hold on.

22:07.527 --> 22:10.027
(beeping)

22:10.029 --> 22:11.896
Why don't I see
any tracings?

22:11.898 --> 22:13.831
Because the freaking monitor
keeps getting stuck

22:13.833 --> 22:14.932
Underneath my bra,

22:14.934 --> 22:19.403
Put down the scalpel if you
feel like you're gonna die.

22:20.573 --> 22:25.109
(alex) midline incision,
open approach, hernia repair.

22:25.111 --> 22:29.880
He has a strangulated hernia,
his bowel is probably necrotic,

22:29.882 --> 22:32.049
He has mets
from pancreatic cancer,

22:32.051 --> 22:34.685
All over the abdomen.
There's scar tissue galore.

22:34.687 --> 22:36.654
Nothing about this
is going to be easy.

22:36.656 --> 22:37.755
I wasn't implying that

22:37.757 --> 22:39.056
It was actually
gonna be easy.

22:39.058 --> 22:40.691
I'm just-- was just trying
to lighten the mood,

22:40.693 --> 22:41.892
You seem tense.

22:41.894 --> 22:43.728
Retractor.

22:45.931 --> 22:50.034
There you are,
you little bastard.

22:50.036 --> 22:51.602
Okay...

22:51.604 --> 22:53.971
What is my approach,
dr. Lin?

22:53.973 --> 22:56.640
Evaluate the bowel.
If it's alive,

22:56.642 --> 22:59.443
Dissect it from the fascia
and reduce the hernia.

22:59.445 --> 23:01.812
If it's dead, resect
and put him back together.

23:01.814 --> 23:03.881
But, I mean, regardless,
it's stage four

23:03.883 --> 23:05.616
Pancreatic cancer,
metastatic.

23:05.618 --> 23:09.019
He'll die in two days
if we don't free the bowel.

23:09.021 --> 23:10.488
And he's in pain.

23:10.490 --> 23:11.956
But you're right.
There's not a lot of hope.

23:11.958 --> 23:13.758
Well, I thought I was
the gloomy one.

23:13.760 --> 23:15.493
But you've gone
all russian on me.

23:15.495 --> 23:17.495
Can't always be
the cheerleader.

23:17.497 --> 23:19.430
Okay, I've released
the bowel.

23:19.432 --> 23:20.898
Run it for me,
maggie.

23:20.900 --> 23:22.900
With pleasure.

23:32.711 --> 23:35.546
That's weird.
I feel something.

23:35.548 --> 23:36.547
Describe it.

23:36.549 --> 23:40.584
It's a mass...
It's something.

23:40.586 --> 23:41.986
Well, he has pancreatic
cancer, maggie,

23:41.988 --> 23:43.954
There are metastases
everywhere.

23:43.956 --> 23:45.022
This mass is big.

23:45.024 --> 23:46.557
It's, uh, it's not
metastatic.

23:46.559 --> 23:48.426
Okay, let me feel it.

23:53.698 --> 23:55.633
This thing is the size
of a tangerine.

23:55.635 --> 23:56.667
Should we scope him?

23:56.669 --> 23:58.669
Yes, definitely.

24:06.711 --> 24:08.813
(maggie) hey, I'm coming to
the end of the colon...

24:08.815 --> 24:11.649
Wait a sec,
freeze it right there.

24:11.651 --> 24:13.117
(beep)

24:13.119 --> 24:14.218
That's a big tumor.

24:14.220 --> 24:18.222
It's the primary.

24:18.224 --> 24:20.458
Does he not have
pancreatic cancer?

24:20.460 --> 24:23.594
No. No, it must've
originated in the colon

24:23.596 --> 24:25.696
And spread to the pancreas.

24:27.699 --> 24:29.166
But--but that means...

24:29.168 --> 24:30.901
That he could make it.

24:41.146 --> 24:43.747
So last man standing
in conflict resolution, huh?

24:43.749 --> 24:45.950
What do you think
that means?

24:45.952 --> 24:48.519
(scoffs) god,
you are relentless.

24:53.825 --> 24:55.693
A year ago,
would you have imagined

24:55.695 --> 24:59.864
Well, a year ago,
I was in a coma, so... No.

24:59.866 --> 25:01.599
Before that.

25:01.601 --> 25:06.237
No.

25:06.239 --> 25:10.941
Nope, I used to be
with the woman I love.

25:10.943 --> 25:12.843
And I used to be
just a regular doctor

25:12.845 --> 25:16.847
Who didn't see...

25:16.849 --> 25:18.682
Dead people.

25:18.684 --> 25:20.050
I thought you said
that stopped.

25:20.052 --> 25:21.619
It did.

25:23.288 --> 25:24.989
Do you miss them?

25:31.229 --> 25:32.563
Do you miss her?

25:32.565 --> 25:34.765
Of course I miss her.

25:39.004 --> 25:42.573
I'm afraid I've lost her
for good.

25:42.575 --> 25:45.109
And that makes you mad.

25:45.111 --> 25:46.944
No, that makes me...

25:49.247 --> 25:51.682
(inhales sharply)

25:51.684 --> 25:53.918
Sad. (exhales deeply)

26:00.725 --> 26:03.827
(exhales)

26:09.034 --> 26:10.301
(scribbles)

26:10.303 --> 26:12.136
(paper rustles)

26:33.725 --> 26:35.926
Now the causes of sleepwalking
aren't well-established.

26:35.928 --> 26:38.028
Please tell me this isn't
a mysterious brain thing.

26:38.030 --> 26:40.664
It is.
It's very mysterious.

26:40.666 --> 26:41.865
See, in your patient,

26:41.867 --> 26:43.233
The part of the brain
that paralyzes

26:43.235 --> 26:46.637
The body during sleep?
That isn't working.

26:46.639 --> 26:48.606
So he's literally
just acting out his dreams?

26:48.608 --> 26:50.207
Yes.

26:50.209 --> 26:54.812
There's nothing you can do,
short of tying him down.

26:54.814 --> 26:56.680
That's unethical.
Unethical.

26:56.682 --> 26:58.015
You're right.

26:58.017 --> 27:00.384
Now, once ian has fully
recovered from surgery,

27:00.386 --> 27:03.854
I can look for lesions,
tumors, vascular malformations

27:03.856 --> 27:05.122
Of the hypothalamus.

27:05.124 --> 27:07.725
Then we can let him
see a psychiatrist.

27:07.727 --> 27:09.226
For a neurological problem?

27:09.228 --> 27:11.895
Well, stress and trauma
are other factors,

27:11.897 --> 27:13.697
You know,
unless I "elm street"

27:13.699 --> 27:15.299
My way into his dreams...
(laughs)

27:15.301 --> 27:17.635
(clears throat)
there's nothing I can do.

27:17.637 --> 27:20.037
Okay. Well, thank you.

27:20.039 --> 27:21.639
Joel?
Mm-hmm?

27:21.641 --> 27:26.176
I just got back
from conflict resolution,

27:26.178 --> 27:29.246
And there's hurt
on both sides.

27:38.657 --> 27:40.024
(alex clears throat)

27:44.362 --> 27:46.196
Les?

27:46.198 --> 27:47.398
Hi. How'd it go?

27:47.400 --> 27:48.766
It went very well.

27:48.768 --> 27:51.235
He should be up
and around soon.

27:51.237 --> 27:53.037
Okay.

27:53.039 --> 27:55.839
You know, I'm waiting
on some test results,

27:55.841 --> 27:59.076
And I can't really
get into the details, but...

27:59.078 --> 28:01.979
Your father may have more time
than we thought.

28:04.716 --> 28:07.051
Um...

28:07.053 --> 28:08.419
Okay.

28:08.421 --> 28:12.990
This is gonna sound
really wrong, but, um...

28:12.992 --> 28:14.158
(voice breaking)
I came here to see my father

28:14.160 --> 28:16.260
Before he... Died.

28:16.262 --> 28:18.962
And I just--I thought
I would regret it if I didn't.

28:18.964 --> 28:21.331
Could be an opportunity.

28:21.333 --> 28:23.367
For what?

28:23.369 --> 28:26.270
He abandoned me and my mom,
he's crazy...

28:26.272 --> 28:29.106
It... Letting him back
in my life

28:29.108 --> 28:30.808
Would just be more trouble
than it's worth.

28:30.810 --> 28:34.044
It might be worth it.

28:34.046 --> 28:35.879
You don't know him.

28:35.881 --> 28:38.415
Be the bigger man?

28:38.417 --> 28:41.018
(laughs)

28:41.020 --> 28:42.853
Usually falls
to the ladies.

28:42.855 --> 28:45.022
Excuse me.

28:45.024 --> 28:46.957
Charlie.

28:46.959 --> 28:48.292
Hi.

28:48.294 --> 28:50.494
How was conflict resolution?

28:50.496 --> 28:53.864
Uh, think oprah meets mcenroe,
and I think you get the idea.

28:53.866 --> 28:54.965
Well, that sounds fun.

28:54.967 --> 28:58.001
It was horrible.
I was... I was horrible.

28:58.003 --> 29:01.438
Did you resolve
your conflict?

29:01.440 --> 29:03.040
Where's your heart monitor?

29:05.877 --> 29:07.411
I don't wanna be monitored.
Alex--

29:07.413 --> 29:09.046
And not by dawn.
So, charlie, can you just--

29:09.048 --> 29:11.315
Come on, this is your life
we're talking about.

29:11.317 --> 29:12.750
Where is it?

29:15.019 --> 29:16.253
In my pocket.

29:18.156 --> 29:19.857
Let me help.

29:19.859 --> 29:21.492
Fine.

29:25.030 --> 29:30.501
No, I'm waiting on some
test results for a patient.

29:32.470 --> 29:34.138
You remember
the great randall?

29:34.140 --> 29:37.508
Yeah. He still alive?

29:37.510 --> 29:39.376
He is.

29:42.280 --> 29:44.281
Thank you.

29:54.959 --> 29:57.861
Are these nonsense?

29:57.863 --> 29:59.496
I mean,
are they real equations?

29:59.498 --> 30:01.799
Yeah, they're real equations.

30:03.334 --> 30:07.171
I don't know, ian.
I mean... (sighs)

30:07.173 --> 30:10.073
Wow.

30:10.075 --> 30:12.009
Maybe if you solved
the equations,

30:12.011 --> 30:14.111
That'll stop
the sleepwalking and...

30:14.113 --> 30:15.846
Truthfully, I'm just...

30:15.848 --> 30:17.881
Really very concerned
about your leg.

30:22.120 --> 30:23.353
What--what is this?

30:25.590 --> 30:27.891
This... (sighs)

30:30.428 --> 30:33.163
This calculates the odds

30:33.165 --> 30:37.367
Of having a baby
over the age of 40.

30:37.369 --> 30:41.839
These are the odds
that he has red hair.

30:41.841 --> 30:45.175
These are the odds
of him reading before he's 6.

30:50.248 --> 30:54.484
These are the odds of him
making the t-ball rep team.

30:56.856 --> 31:00.224
He'll believe in santa
till he's 8.

31:12.370 --> 31:13.437
(voice breaking)
these are the odds

31:13.439 --> 31:15.372
Of him being...
Hit by a truck

31:15.374 --> 31:17.507
On his way to school.

31:21.447 --> 31:25.249
Surviving the death
of your child...

31:28.453 --> 31:30.654
Of you losing your job.

31:33.491 --> 31:37.094
I'm so sorry.

31:37.096 --> 31:39.596
(whispers) I'm so tired.

31:44.535 --> 31:45.602
So this is definitive?

31:45.604 --> 31:47.371
That's what pathology says.

31:47.373 --> 31:48.572
It's mind-blowing.

31:48.574 --> 31:50.607
Just don't call it a miracle.

31:53.578 --> 31:55.913
Randall.

31:55.915 --> 31:58.282
We got back
your pathology report.

31:58.284 --> 32:01.585
You were misdiagnosed.
You have colon cancer.

32:01.587 --> 32:02.953
It's good news.

32:02.955 --> 32:04.021
What?

32:04.023 --> 32:06.290
How is colon cancer
good news?

32:06.292 --> 32:09.092
It's a different cancer,
one with a better prognosis.

32:09.094 --> 32:10.928
It's one we can treat.

32:10.930 --> 32:12.596
(exhales)

32:12.598 --> 32:19.536
But--they--they just commuted
my death sentence, I think.

32:19.538 --> 32:24.508
We're not out of the woods yet,
but this is very good news.

32:29.180 --> 32:31.581
(sighs)
so congratulations.

32:34.052 --> 32:36.486
I don't know what--what
I'm supposed to do.

32:36.488 --> 32:39.056
You don't have
to do anything.

32:39.058 --> 32:41.191
Just stay,
I'll do it all.

32:41.193 --> 32:44.494
You shouldn't have to work
to be my daughter.

32:44.496 --> 32:48.365
'cause you're not gonna be able
to take care of yourself.

32:48.367 --> 32:50.300
What?
(laughs)

32:50.302 --> 32:53.603
For the love of god,
look at the hair.

32:53.605 --> 32:54.638
Is this the hair
of a man

32:54.640 --> 32:56.173
Who can't take care
of himself?

32:56.175 --> 32:57.741
I have your hair.

32:57.743 --> 32:59.209
Yes, you do.

32:59.211 --> 33:01.111
And your eyebrows.

33:01.113 --> 33:03.981
Yeah. Sorry about that.

33:03.983 --> 33:05.582
(laughs) it's okay.

33:05.584 --> 33:08.618
I forgot the good parts
about you.

33:08.620 --> 33:12.222
But this news,
I'm really happy for you.

33:12.224 --> 33:14.191
I feel so fantastic.

33:14.193 --> 33:15.726
I feel fantastic.

33:15.728 --> 33:19.363
I wanna do something
celebratory, I--

33:19.365 --> 33:22.699
That's 'cause your sedation
hasn't worn off yet.

33:22.701 --> 33:24.101
(laughs)
no.

33:24.103 --> 33:26.336
Hey!
Yeah?

33:26.338 --> 33:29.606
Do you know the watusi?

33:29.608 --> 33:32.743
Joel, I'm sorry for what
I said about you

33:32.745 --> 33:36.413
Never getting back together
with your girlfriend.

33:36.415 --> 33:39.483
You kind of have bigger
fish to fry, man.

33:39.485 --> 33:42.686
No, no, the numbers aren't
favorable but...

33:42.688 --> 33:45.522
I didn't factor in
the implied odds.

33:45.524 --> 33:47.724
It's a poker thing,
isn't it?

33:47.726 --> 33:48.725
Yeah, you have to consider
the outcome

33:48.727 --> 33:51.194
If things go your way.

33:51.196 --> 33:53.463
Um...
(lever clicks)

33:53.465 --> 33:55.732
How exactly does that relate
to--to alex?

33:55.734 --> 33:57.434
It's an if/then proposition.

33:57.436 --> 34:01.138
If you'd be substantially
happier, you should go for it,

34:01.140 --> 34:05.342
I should've factored that
into the original equation,

34:05.344 --> 34:08.445
So, okay, what--what
are my odds now?

34:08.447 --> 34:10.213
They're considerably
improved.

34:10.215 --> 34:11.715
Thank you.

34:13.618 --> 34:15.652
Well, um, why don't you...

34:15.654 --> 34:17.454
Close your eyes,
get some rest?

34:17.456 --> 34:20.090
I'm not going anywhere.
I'm right here.

34:27.799 --> 34:30.333
(knocks on door)

34:30.335 --> 34:31.735
Oh, hey, doc.

34:31.737 --> 34:35.072
Do you know how to work
this tv thing?

34:35.074 --> 34:37.340
Yeah, I do.

34:37.342 --> 34:38.742
(clears throat)

34:38.744 --> 34:40.410
You wanted to talk to me,
randall?

34:40.412 --> 34:43.814
Or, uh, change your mind because
you wanted to watch golf?

34:43.816 --> 34:45.849
Yeah.

34:45.851 --> 34:49.252
I'm, uh,
lifting your curse.

34:52.223 --> 34:54.091
I don't see them anymore.
It doesn't matter

34:54.093 --> 34:55.292
If you don't talk
to dead people anymore,

34:55.294 --> 34:58.161
You still feel cursed
inside, don't you?

34:58.163 --> 35:00.330
Hmm?

35:00.332 --> 35:01.865
And don't talk,
just listen.

35:01.867 --> 35:05.869
Things can still turn out
okay for you.

35:05.871 --> 35:07.737
Pfft.

35:07.739 --> 35:08.805
You're free.

35:08.807 --> 35:11.808
(footsteps approaching)

35:11.810 --> 35:13.276
Hi.
Hi.

35:13.278 --> 35:14.811
Hi. (chuckles)

35:21.486 --> 35:23.553
(speaks indistinctly)

35:26.524 --> 35:29.626
(monitor beeping steadily)

35:40.605 --> 35:42.706
(telephone rings in distance)

35:44.642 --> 35:47.577
(inhales deeply)

36:03.194 --> 36:05.428
(telephone rings in distance)

36:29.887 --> 36:31.555
(object clatters)

36:31.557 --> 36:33.190
(sighs)

36:38.796 --> 36:40.330
Excuse me?

36:43.467 --> 36:44.601
Sir?

36:48.439 --> 36:50.907
You know, you can't
be in here.

36:50.909 --> 36:54.411
Sir.

36:56.514 --> 36:57.781
You can't be in here.

36:57.783 --> 36:58.882
Let's get you back
to your--

36:58.884 --> 37:01.284
(groans)
(squish)

37:01.286 --> 37:04.521
(gasping)

37:14.632 --> 37:17.500
(door closes)
(groans)

37:21.772 --> 37:23.306
(grunts)

37:34.385 --> 37:36.653
H-help.

37:42.326 --> 37:43.693
Help...

37:43.695 --> 37:47.364
(groans)

37:47.366 --> 37:49.432
Help me.

37:53.604 --> 37:57.807
(cell phone beeping)

37:57.809 --> 37:59.276
(indistinct conversation)

37:59.278 --> 38:02.445
(beeping continues)

38:09.754 --> 38:11.921

38:11.923 --> 38:14.291

38:14.293 --> 38:16.660

38:16.662 --> 38:18.662

38:18.664 --> 38:21.631

38:21.633 --> 38:23.533

38:23.535 --> 38:27.771
(buzz)

38:27.773 --> 38:29.639
(dawn) alex?

38:29.641 --> 38:31.641
Yeah. Help.

38:31.643 --> 38:33.343
Alex, where are you?

38:33.345 --> 38:35.378
Where are you?
Tell me where you are.

38:35.380 --> 38:36.479
(coughing and wheezing)

38:36.481 --> 38:38.081
Talk to me.
(whispers) help.

38:38.083 --> 38:39.449
(normal voice) help.

38:39.451 --> 38:41.785
Alex? Alex?

38:41.787 --> 38:44.387
(phone clatters)

38:44.389 --> 38:49.492
(breathing unevenly)

38:49.494 --> 38:53.330
(groaning)

39:02.606 --> 39:03.807
Maggie, have you seen alex?

39:03.809 --> 39:05.675
Yeah, a while ago
on the ward, why?

39:05.677 --> 39:06.876
Her heart rate
is through the roof.

39:06.878 --> 39:08.078
And it's different
than the arrhythmia

39:08.080 --> 39:09.346
That I've been
monitoring her for.

39:09.348 --> 39:15.418
Well, could her monitor
have fallen off, maybe?
No, it's definitely working.

39:15.420 --> 39:17.087
And her tracings are clear.
It's scary.

39:17.089 --> 39:18.755
We gotta find her now.

39:22.793 --> 39:26.563
(groans)

39:26.565 --> 39:29.866
(groaning)

39:42.413 --> 39:44.748
(whimpers)

39:50.755 --> 39:52.455
(beep)

39:54.592 --> 39:56.960
<i>(woman over p.A.)</i>
<i>code blue, five east, 64.</i>

39:56.962 --> 40:00.130
<i>Code blue, five east, 64.</i>

40:00.132 --> 40:02.832
<i>Code blue, five east, 64.</i>

(labored breathing)

40:16.882 --> 40:18.081
Alex?

40:18.083 --> 40:20.950
Oh, my god.
Alex!

40:20.952 --> 40:22.819
Oh, god. Stay with us.
Open your--

40:22.821 --> 40:24.687
Keep your eyes open.
Don't try to talk,
don't try to talk.

40:24.689 --> 40:26.022
We gotta get her
to the o.R.

40:26.024 --> 40:30.193
You! I need a large bore
I.V.S, o-neg blood,

40:30.195 --> 40:32.595
And I need a stretcher now.
I need it now!

40:32.597 --> 40:34.798
Stay with me. Look at me.
You've lost a lot of blood.

40:34.800 --> 40:38.968
You're gonna be just fine.
Look at me. Stay with me.
Keep her eyes open.

40:38.970 --> 40:41.738
Stay, stay.
Get me that stretcher!
Eyes open!

40:41.740 --> 40:42.806
Alex.
You're gonna be fine.

40:42.808 --> 40:45.608
(cell phone vibrates)

40:49.013 --> 40:51.548
(bell dings, door opens)

40:51.550 --> 40:53.817
(man) out of the way.
Get out of the way, please.

40:53.819 --> 40:55.919
(maggie) keep your eyes open,
look at me.
Make a hole!

40:55.921 --> 40:57.153
Hey, let's go, let's go!

40:58.556 --> 41:00.557
(maggie) stay with me.

41:00.559 --> 41:02.525
I got it, I got it,
I got it.

41:02.527 --> 41:03.693
Maggie, you're with me.
We're going to do

41:03.695 --> 41:05.161
A left thoracotomy
and find the bleed.

41:05.163 --> 41:06.663
It's in her heart!
I'm here, baby. I'm here.

41:06.665 --> 41:09.098
We're not gonna know
until we get in there.

41:11.569 --> 41:15.472
On three!
One, two, three.

41:17.842 --> 41:19.642
(water running)
can you handle this?

41:19.644 --> 41:20.777
Yeah.

41:20.779 --> 41:22.946
I'm fine.
She's gonna be fine.

41:22.948 --> 41:24.714
Alex, I'm right here.

41:24.716 --> 41:26.716
Stay with me, okay?
Stay with me.

41:26.718 --> 41:28.785
(monitor beeps)

41:28.787 --> 41:30.086
Heart rate's 160. B.P.'s 85.

41:30.088 --> 41:32.789
Okay, stay with me.
Look at me.
(gasping)

41:32.791 --> 41:33.957
Stay awake.

41:33.959 --> 41:36.226
Can you stay awake for me?
Look at me.

41:36.228 --> 41:38.761
Okay, we're gonna fix you,
all right?

41:38.763 --> 41:44.567
Sweetheart, look at me.
Look at me. I love you.

41:44.569 --> 41:46.503
I love you.
We're gonna fix you.

41:46.505 --> 41:50.173
Keep your eyes open,
look at me, look at me.

41:50.175 --> 41:52.809
(monitor beeping rapidly)
hurry!

41:52.811 --> 41:54.110
Stay with me.

41:54.112 --> 41:56.246
Stay right here,
don't you give up.

41:56.248 --> 41:59.716
Don't give up, baby.

41:59.718 --> 42:00.817
(flatlining)
no...

42:01.952 --> 42:05.722
Dawn!

42:05.724 --> 42:07.524
(squish)
(grunts)

42:07.526 --> 42:08.791
What are you doing?

42:08.793 --> 42:10.260
I can't do compressions
with the scissors in.

42:12.796 --> 42:13.830
Okay, get me iodine
and a scalpel.

42:13.832 --> 42:15.932
I'm opening her up.

42:15.934 --> 42:18.201
I need to tube her.

42:18.203 --> 42:19.269
Charlie, move.

42:19.271 --> 42:20.670
(maggie)
I've got compressions.

42:20.672 --> 42:25.909
Charlie,
I gotta cut her. Move!
I've got it, charlie.
I've got it.

42:27.978 --> 42:30.113
Okay, bolus her.

42:30.115 --> 42:31.848
I need a chest spreader.

42:31.850 --> 42:34.584
(dawn) bone saw.

42:34.586 --> 42:36.619
(continues flatlining)

42:36.621 --> 42:42.559
Stay with us, alex.
Come on.

42:42.561 --> 42:47.564
(woman) â™ª and it all

42:47.566 --> 42:54.170
â™ª falls down

42:57.775 --> 43:00.043
