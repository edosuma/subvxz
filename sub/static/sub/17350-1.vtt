Oh, wow, Parker,
isn't it amazing?

00:41.267 --> 00:43.600
I'm stunned, milady.

00:43.667 --> 00:48.400
In all my years, I've never
seen anything quite like it.

00:48.467 --> 00:52.167
All this luggage
for a single-night stay?

00:52.233 --> 00:54.567
You've really
outdone yourself.

00:54.633 --> 00:55.733
Thank you.

00:55.800 --> 00:56.900
You know it's all just
for show, though, don't you?

00:56.967 --> 00:58.033
It's what they expect.

00:58.100 --> 00:59.867
Hello!

01:00.067 --> 01:01.667
-Maybe they could give me
a hand with it.

01:10.167 --> 01:12.067
Lady Penelope,
how's the grand opening?

01:12.100 --> 01:14.067
Oh, quite the scene,
but it would be far more fun

01:14.133 --> 01:16.500
if the man who made it
all possible could
be here with me.

01:16.567 --> 01:19.067
Oh, I'm not much
for p-parties.

01:19.133 --> 01:20.600
Even this is more
than I deserve.

01:20.667 --> 01:22.667
Taking a bow may not be
your style, Brains,

01:22.733 --> 01:25.733
but you gotta admit your
nano-construction technology
is a game-changer.

01:25.800 --> 01:27.633
The entire hotel
auto-assembled in a week.

01:27.700 --> 01:29.567
Well, you can't blame
a girl for trying.

01:29.633 --> 01:31.667
I'll get you out of
that workshop one of
these days, Brains.

01:31.733 --> 01:33.600
Oh, got to go.

01:33.667 --> 01:35.633
This is Cat Cavener
reporting live from
the Australia Grand.

01:35.700 --> 01:36.633
Let's see who's here.

01:36.700 --> 01:38.600
Nice place for a party,
don't you think?

01:38.667 --> 01:40.700
I don't care about
society events, Lady Penelope.

01:40.767 --> 01:44.067
I want to know if you have
any comment on the claims
that the hotel is unsafe.

01:44.133 --> 01:48.667
This dangerous,
unproven technology
has no place in our world!

-And using it for the very
first time in space?
-(BEEPS)

it's a recipe for disaster!

a complete idiot.

02:00.933 --> 02:01.933

02:02.067 --> 02:03.667
I know the inventor
personally.

02:03.733 --> 02:07.500
And have every confidence
that not only is it safe,

02:07.567 --> 02:09.900
but this kind of technology
would inspire buildings

VIRGIL: Thunderbird 5,
what's going on up there?

03:31.200 --> 03:34.233
Sounds like some kind
of a structural failure
in the outer hull.

03:34.300 --> 03:36.833
Structural failure?
That can't be right.

03:36.900 --> 03:41.067
And even if it is,
the nano-matrix should
reassemble automatically.

03:41.100 --> 03:42.833

something wrong?
-(MAX BEEPS)

(GROANING) Speak
for yourself, milady.

03:48.900 --> 03:50.900
John, have you made
any contact with the hotel?

03:50.967 --> 03:52.967
They are reporting some
of the maneuvering thrusters

03:53.067 --> 03:54.233
were damaged in the blast.

03:54.300 --> 03:56.067
They can't control the spin.

03:56.067 --> 03:57.200
The force of the decompression

03:57.267 --> 03:59.333
has pushed the hotel
out of orbit.

03:59.400 --> 04:01.267
Unless we can correct that,

04:01.333 --> 04:04.400
it's going to enter
the atmosphere and crash.

04:04.467 --> 04:05.833
Wouldn't it burn up
on re-entry?

04:05.900 --> 04:07.667
No, Scott, I'm afraid not.

04:07.733 --> 04:11.500
The nano-matrix is
designed to withstand
that kind of heat.

04:11.567 --> 04:13.900
Something this large
hitting the ground,

04:13.967 --> 04:16.533
it would be c-catastrophic.

04:16.600 --> 04:18.700
-What have I done?
-Come on, Brains,

04:18.767 --> 04:20.567
let's go down to
that workshop of yours

04:20.633 --> 04:21.933
and think something up.

04:22.067 --> 04:24.300
-What do you say?
-BRAINS: Yes. Good idea.

04:24.367 --> 04:27.067
-We'll think of a solution.
-I'll join you.

04:27.100 --> 04:30.133
(SIGHS) We need to
get that hotel back
into a stable orbit.

04:30.200 --> 04:32.800
John, let them know
that International Rescue
is on the way.

04:32.867 --> 04:35.067
They should prepare
the escape capsules
just in case.

04:35.067 --> 04:36.833
Good idea.

04:36.900 --> 04:39.667
Alan, as soon as
Thunderbird 3 is fueled up,
I want you to launch.

04:39.733 --> 04:41.467
Let's try and use the
maneuvering thrusters

04:41.533 --> 04:43.867
to push the hotel
back into position.

04:43.933 --> 04:45.400
-I'm on it.
-Lady Penelope.

04:45.467 --> 04:47.167
Can you help reassure
all the guests

04:47.233 --> 04:48.633
that we won't let
anything happen to them?

04:48.700 --> 04:50.967
F-A-B, Scott.
Consider it done.

Thunderbird 2 airborne
and pick up Gordon.

If those escape capsules
start dropping into the ocean,

04:56.600 --> 04:58.700
-we'll need someone
to grab them.
-What about you?

04:58.767 --> 05:01.067
I'll ride up in the pod
aboard Thunderbird 3

05:01.100 --> 05:03.167
and take a look
at the damage firsthand.

05:03.233 --> 05:04.967
If we can get
enough data to Brains,

05:05.067 --> 05:06.933
maybe he can figure out
what went wrong.

-Yeah.

a more cautious,
thorough person than you.

06:49.833 --> 06:54.467
I'd be very surprised
if this was because of
something you did wrong.

We don't typically
consult with our guts.

give it a try. What do I do?

07:05.933 --> 07:09.067
Close your eyes
and listen to your feelings.

07:09.067 --> 07:10.767
What are your first instincts?

07:10.833 --> 07:14.800
The hotel structure
should be indestructible
by normal means.

07:14.867 --> 07:17.167
The molecular bonds
are just too tight.

07:17.233 --> 07:19.600
For a hull breach
of this m-magnitude,

07:19.667 --> 07:21.833
someone must have
tampered with it.

07:21.900 --> 07:23.933
It's the only explanation.

07:24.067 --> 07:25.500
But sabotage?

even be possible?

I have nothing against
the hotel, it's what it
represents.

16:59.900 --> 17:03.233
This new age in
building things would
mean a quick death

17:03.300 --> 17:06.067
to the industries
I worked very hard to control.

17:06.067 --> 17:08.700
This would put you out of
the construction business.

17:08.767 --> 17:11.067
All I needed to do
was sow the seeds of doubt

17:11.100 --> 17:15.300
and the world would reject
the nano-construction
that built this hotel.

17:15.367 --> 17:18.633
So you pose as a scientist
to shout the sky is falling,

17:18.700 --> 17:21.167
then use that thing
to actually make it happen.

17:21.233 --> 17:23.167
I only meant
to cause a panic.

17:23.233 --> 17:26.100
The imminent crash
is simply a bonus.

17:26.167 --> 17:27.467

17:27.533 --> 17:30.167
They had plenty of escape
capsules waiting for them

17:30.233 --> 17:34.067

decided to show up.

make it easy for you.
