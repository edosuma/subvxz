00:21.425 --> 00:24.303
"Where no man has gone before."

00:24.512 --> 00:26.472
Dr Cochrane
would be proud of you.

00:26.682 --> 00:28.100
I know the whole speech by heart.

00:28.684 --> 00:31.729
- When's it gonna be ready to fly?
- Let the paint dry first.

00:31.980 --> 00:33.648
No, I mean your ship.

00:33.899 --> 00:36.861
Not for a while. It's not even built yet.
You know that.

00:37.111 --> 00:39.406
- How big will it be?
- Pretty big.

00:39.614 --> 00:41.701
Bigger than
Ambassador Pointy's ship?

00:41.909 --> 00:44.162
His name is Soval,
and he's been very helpful.

00:44.413 --> 00:46.290
And I told you not to call him that,
Jonathan.

00:46.498 --> 00:48.960
Well, Billy Cook said we'd be flying
at warp 5 by now

00:49.210 --> 00:51.463
if the Vulcans hadn't
kept things from us.

00:51.672 --> 00:54.008
Well, they have their reasons.

00:54.216 --> 00:55.719
God knows what they are.

02:39.643 --> 02:42.229
Drop your weapon. I mean it.

02:44.566 --> 02:46.109
I don't understand a word
you're saying,

02:46.317 --> 02:48.195
but I guarantee you,
I know how to use this.

03:00.252 --> 03:05.593
"It's been a long road
Gettin' from there to here"

03:08.054 --> 03:11.475
"It's been a long time"

03:11.684 --> 03:15.522
"But my time is finally near"

03:15.731 --> 03:19.986
"And I will see my dream
Come alive at last"

03:20.194 --> 03:23.115
"I will touch the sky"

03:23.323 --> 03:27.120
"And they're not gonna
Hold me down no more"

03:27.370 --> 03:30.332
"No, they're not gonna change my mind"

03:30.541 --> 03:35.255
"'Cause I've got faith of the heart"

03:35.506 --> 03:38.384
"I'm going where my heart will take me"

03:38.634 --> 03:43.182
"I've got faith to believe"

03:43.433 --> 03:45.977
"I can do anything"

03:46.228 --> 03:50.692
"I've got strength of the soul"

03:50.942 --> 03:53.779
"And no one's gonna bend or break me"

03:54.030 --> 03:59.369
"I can reach any star"

03:59.745 --> 04:03.458
"I've got faith"

04:03.709 --> 04:07.380
"I've got faith"

04:07.630 --> 04:12.428
"Faith of the heart"

04:46.904 --> 04:50.408
The Ventral Plating Team says
they'll be done in about three days.

04:50.617 --> 04:53.370
Be sure they match the colour
to the nacelle housings.

04:53.579 --> 04:56.124
Planning to sit on the hull
and pose for some postcards?

04:56.374 --> 04:57.751
Maybe.

05:01.380 --> 05:02.966
God, she's beautiful.

05:03.217 --> 05:04.968
And fast.

05:05.177 --> 05:07.555
Warp 4.5 next Thursday.

05:07.764 --> 05:11.353
Neptune and back in six minutes.

05:12.062 --> 05:14.440
Let's take a look
at the lateral sensor array.

05:14.649 --> 05:16.484
Give me a sec.

05:21.991 --> 05:23.911
Slow down.

05:24.119 --> 05:25.662
There.

05:25.913 --> 05:28.041
Those are the ports that buckled
during the last test.

05:28.249 --> 05:30.752
They need to be reinforced.

05:35.884 --> 05:39.722
Great. You scratched the paint.

05:39.931 --> 05:41.934
Sorry.

05:42.935 --> 05:43.977
Orbital 6.

05:44.186 --> 05:45.688
- Captain Archer, sir?
- Go ahead.

05:45.897 --> 05:49.568
Admiral Forrest needs you
at Starfleet Medical right away.

05:56.370 --> 05:58.538
- Who was chasing him?
- We don't know.

05:58.747 --> 06:01.793
They were incinerated
in the methane explosion,

06:02.001 --> 06:05.464
and the farmer's description
was vague at best.

06:05.672 --> 06:07.884
How did they get here?
What kind of ship?

06:08.092 --> 06:10.596
They were using some kind
of stealth technology.

06:10.804 --> 06:12.807
We're still analysing our sensor logs.

06:13.058 --> 06:15.101
I'd like to see those logs.

06:15.310 --> 06:19.858
The Klingons made it very clear
they want us to expedite this.

06:20.067 --> 06:22.277
It happened on our soil.

06:22.486 --> 06:23.821
That's irrelevant.

06:24.072 --> 06:25.406
Ambassador,

06:25.615 --> 06:28.410
with all due respect, we have a right
to know what's going on here.

06:28.786 --> 06:31.664
You will be apprised
of all pertinent information.

06:32.290 --> 06:35.169
And just who gets to decide
what's pertinent information?

06:35.377 --> 06:37.673
- Admiral.
- Jon.

06:37.882 --> 06:40.384
I think you know everyone.

06:40.969 --> 06:43.180
Not everyone.

06:47.060 --> 06:48.687
It's a "Klingot."

06:49.396 --> 06:50.814
A Klingon.

06:52.317 --> 06:55.112
- Where did he come from?
- Oklahoma.

06:55.905 --> 06:58.533
Corn farmer named Moore
shot him with a plasma rifle.

06:58.742 --> 07:00.077
Says it was self-defence.

07:00.285 --> 07:03.539
Fortunately, Soval and I have
maintained close contact with Kronos...

07:03.748 --> 07:05.376
since the incident occurred.

07:05.584 --> 07:08.880
- Kronos?
- It's the Klingons' homeworld.

07:10.215 --> 07:12.676
This gentleman's some sort
of a courier.

07:12.885 --> 07:16.014
Evidently, he was carrying
crucial information back to his people.

07:16.264 --> 07:18.767
When he was nearly killed
by your farmer.

07:19.435 --> 07:22.606
Ambassador Soval thinks it would
be best if we push off your launch

07:22.815 --> 07:24.150
until we've cleared this up.

07:24.359 --> 07:26.278
Well, isn't that a surprise.

07:26.487 --> 07:27.863
You'd think they would
have come up

07:28.072 --> 07:30.158
with something a little more
imaginative this time.

07:30.408 --> 07:33.621
Sarcasm aside, captain,
the last thing your people need

07:33.829 --> 07:36.082
is to make an enemy
of The Klingon Empire.

07:36.332 --> 07:40.128
If we hadn't convinced them to let us
take Klaang's corpse back to Kronos,

07:40.338 --> 07:42.715
Earth would most likely be facing
a squadron of warbirds...

07:42.924 --> 07:44.051
by the end of the week.

07:44.468 --> 07:45.844
Corpse?

07:46.053 --> 07:48.181
Is he dead?

07:50.100 --> 07:52.144
Excuse me. Is this man dead?

07:52.645 --> 07:54.606
His autonomic system was disrupted
by the blast,

07:54.815 --> 07:56.274
but his redundant neural functions...

07:56.483 --> 07:58.486
Is he going to die?

07:58.694 --> 07:59.987
Not necessarily.

08:04.618 --> 08:05.621
Let me get this straight.

08:05.871 --> 08:07.998
You're gonna disconnect this man
from life support,

08:08.208 --> 08:09.501
even though he could live.

08:09.709 --> 08:11.671
Now, where is the logic in that?

08:11.921 --> 08:14.632
Klaang's culture finds honour
in death.

08:14.840 --> 08:17.260
If they saw him like this,
he'd be disgraced.

08:17.469 --> 08:20.473
They're a warrior race.
They dream of dying in battle.

08:20.681 --> 08:23.435
If you understood the complexities
of interstellar diplomacy...

08:23.644 --> 08:26.397
So that's your diplomatic solution?
To do what they tell you?

08:26.606 --> 08:27.857
Pull the plug?

08:28.108 --> 08:31.362
Your metaphor is crude,
but accurate.

08:31.612 --> 08:33.782
We may be crude,
but we're not murderers.

08:33.990 --> 08:36.202
You're not gonna let them do this,
are you?

08:36.910 --> 08:40.539
The Klingons have demanded
that we return Klaang immediately.

08:40.791 --> 08:43.878
- Admiral?
- We need to defer to their judgment.

08:44.128 --> 08:46.506
We've been deferring to their
judgment for 100 years.

08:46.757 --> 08:49.093
- How much longer?
- Until you've proven you're ready.

08:49.301 --> 08:50.429
Ready to what?

08:50.638 --> 08:53.557
To look beyond your provincial
attitudes and your volatile nature.

08:53.709 --> 08:55.435
Volatile?

08:55.644 --> 08:57.522
You have no idea how much
I'm restraining myself...

08:57.730 --> 08:59.273
from knocking you on your ass.

09:04.948 --> 09:08.661
These Klingons, they're anxious
to get their man back. Fine.

09:08.869 --> 09:11.248
I can have my ship ready to go
in three days.

09:11.456 --> 09:13.875
We'll take him back home. Alive.

09:14.084 --> 09:17.630
This is no time to be imposing
your ethical beliefs.

09:19.132 --> 09:21.803
- Dan?
- What about your crew?

09:22.053 --> 09:23.805
Your com officer's in Brazil.

09:24.055 --> 09:25.933
You haven't selected
a medical officer yet.

09:26.083 --> 09:27.559
Three days, that's all I need.

09:28.352 --> 09:30.480
Admiral.

09:36.198 --> 09:40.406
We've been waiting for nearly
a century, ambassador.

09:41.781 --> 09:44.865
This seems as good a time as any
to get started.

09:45.114 --> 09:46.990
Listen to me.
You're making a mistake.

09:47.199 --> 09:50.199
When your logic doesn't work,
you raise your voice?

09:50.449 --> 09:53.366
You've been on Earth too long.

10:03.825 --> 10:07.242
I had a feeling their approach
wouldn't sit too well with you.

10:07.451 --> 10:09.658
Don't screw this up.

10:33.120 --> 10:36.412
I heard this platform's been approved
for bio-transport.

10:36.620 --> 10:39.538
I presume you mean fruits
and vegetables.

10:39.787 --> 10:42.538
I mean armoury officers
and helmsmen.

10:43.246 --> 10:44.954
I don't think I'm ready
to have my molecules

10:45.163 --> 10:47.329
compressed into a data stream.

10:49.372 --> 10:50.705
They claim it's safe.

10:50.913 --> 10:52.789
Do they indeed?

10:52.998 --> 10:56.331
Well, I certainly hope the captain
doesn't plan on making us use it.

10:56.539 --> 10:58.205
Don't worry.

10:58.455 --> 11:02.082
From what I'm told, he wouldn't even
put his dog through this thing.

11:04.249 --> 11:05.873
This is ridiculous.

11:06.124 --> 11:09.624
I ask for plasma coils, and they
send me a case of valve sealant.

11:10.333 --> 11:13.041
There's no chance I can have
these weapons online in three days.

11:13.291 --> 11:15.291
We're just taking a sick man
back to his homeworld.

11:15.500 --> 11:16.500
Why do we need weapons?

11:16.750 --> 11:19.834
Didn't you read the profile report
on these Klingons?

11:20.041 --> 11:23.375
Apparently, they sharpen their teeth
before they go into battle.

11:32.043 --> 11:33.918
No doubt Mr Tucker
will reassure me...

11:34.126 --> 11:36.377
that my equipment
will be here tomorrow,

11:36.585 --> 11:38.627
"Keep your shirt on, lieutenant."

11:38.835 --> 11:42.002
Is it me or does the artificial gravity
seem a bit heavy?

11:42.211 --> 11:44.502
Feels all right. Earth sea level.

11:44.711 --> 11:46.796
My father always kept it at .8 G.

11:47.003 --> 11:48.712
Thought it put a little spring
in his step.

11:48.921 --> 11:51.045
Being raised on ships,
it must have felt like you had

11:51.253 --> 11:52.921
lead in your boots
when you got to Earth.

12:01.505 --> 12:04.505
Beautiful. Lock it off right there.

12:17.381 --> 12:20.215
I believe you missed a spot.

12:20.423 --> 12:23.299
Commander Tucker,
Ensign Travis Mayweather.

12:23.507 --> 12:26.007
- He just arrived.
- Our space boomer.

12:26.257 --> 12:29.299
- How fast have you gotten her?
- Warp 4.

12:29.507 --> 12:32.258
We'll be going to 4.5
as soon as we clear Jupiter.

12:32.467 --> 12:33.550
Think you can handle it?

12:33.760 --> 12:35.925
4.5?

12:36.134 --> 12:38.010
Pardon me, but if I don't realign
the deflector,

12:38.217 --> 12:39.925
the first grain of space dust
we come across...

12:40.134 --> 12:42.426
will blow a hole through this ship
the size of your fist.

12:42.676 --> 12:44.093
Keep your shirt on, lieutenant.

12:44.343 --> 12:47.403
Your equipment will be here
in the morning.

12:59.411 --> 13:00.704
Very good.

13:06.586 --> 13:08.130
Carlos.

13:18.019 --> 13:19.689
Tighten the back of your tongue.

13:24.736 --> 13:26.573
Keep trying, you've almost got it.

13:26.781 --> 13:28.575
I'll be right back.

13:29.577 --> 13:31.287
There's two more weeks
before exams.

13:31.495 --> 13:33.081
It's impossible for me to leave now.

13:33.290 --> 13:35.834
You've gotta have someone
who can cover for you.

13:36.043 --> 13:37.838
If there was anyone else
who can do what I do,

13:38.046 --> 13:40.508
you wouldn't be so eager
to have me on your spaceship.

13:40.717 --> 13:42.468
- Hoshi...
- I'm sorry, captain,

13:42.677 --> 13:44.096
I owe it to these kids.

13:44.305 --> 13:46.348
I could order you.

13:46.557 --> 13:48.435
I'm on leave from Starfleet,
remember?

13:48.643 --> 13:51.605
You would have to forcibly recall me,
which would require a reprimand,

13:51.814 --> 13:54.985
which would disqualify me
from serving on an active vessel.

13:55.485 --> 13:57.613
I need someone with your ear.

13:57.865 --> 13:59.700
And you'll have her, in three weeks.

14:05.458 --> 14:07.252
What's that?

14:08.337 --> 14:13.927
Klingon. Ambassador Soval gave us
a sampling of their linguistic database.

14:14.136 --> 14:16.180
I thought you said the Vulcans
were opposed to this.

14:16.389 --> 14:20.436
They are. But we agreed to make
a few compromises.

14:23.565 --> 14:25.652
What do you know about these...

14:25.861 --> 14:28.113
...Klingons?
- Not much.

14:28.321 --> 14:30.533
An empire of warriors.

14:30.742 --> 14:36.541
With 80 polyguttural dialects
constructed on an adaptive syntax.

14:36.749 --> 14:38.293
Turn it up.

14:40.504 --> 14:44.385
Think of it. You'd be the first human
to talk to these people.

14:44.594 --> 14:46.722
Do you really want
someone else to do it?

14:56.318 --> 14:58.446
Since when do we have
Vulcan science officers?

14:58.696 --> 15:01.366
Since we needed their star charts
to get to Kronos.

15:01.616 --> 15:04.162
So we get a few maps,
and they get to put a spy on our ship?

15:04.787 --> 15:07.833
Admiral Forrest says we should
think of her more as a chaperone.

15:08.083 --> 15:10.461
I thought the whole point was
to get away from the Vulcans.

15:10.920 --> 15:14.258
Four days there and four days back.
Then she's gone.

15:14.551 --> 15:17.889
In the meantime,
we're to extend her every courtesy.

15:18.181 --> 15:22.728
I don't know. I'd be more comfortable
with Porthos on the bridge.

15:23.770 --> 15:25.398
Here we go.

15:25.607 --> 15:27.610
Come in.

15:30.530 --> 15:33.784
This confirms that I was transferred
to your command at 0800 hours.

15:34.076 --> 15:36.038
Reporting for duty.

15:43.298 --> 15:44.924
Is there a problem?

15:45.133 --> 15:46.385
No, sir.

15:49.263 --> 15:52.601
Oh, I forgot. Vulcan females
have a heightened sense of smell.

15:53.060 --> 15:55.771
I hope Porthos isn't too offensive
to you.

15:55.980 --> 15:58.984
I've been trained to tolerate
offensive situations.

15:59.234 --> 16:02.573
I took a shower this morning.
How about you, captain?

16:02.823 --> 16:06.996
I'm sorry,
this is Commander Charles Tucker III.

16:07.204 --> 16:08.914
Subcommander T'Pol.

16:09.123 --> 16:12.211
Trip. I'm called Trip.

16:12.420 --> 16:14.465
I'll try to remember that.

16:18.678 --> 16:21.599
While you may not share
our enthusiasm about this mission,

16:21.807 --> 16:23.642
I expect you to follow our rules.

16:23.851 --> 16:25.687
What's said in this room
and out on that bridge...

16:25.897 --> 16:27.356
is privileged information.

16:27.565 --> 16:30.110
I don't want every word I say
being picked apart the next day...

16:30.319 --> 16:31.738
by the Vulcan High Command.

16:31.988 --> 16:34.616
My reason for being here
is not espionage.

16:34.825 --> 16:37.369
My superiors simply asked me
to assist you.

16:37.620 --> 16:39.497
Your superiors don't think
we can flush a toilet...

16:39.706 --> 16:41.374
without one of you to assist us.

16:41.750 --> 16:44.378
I didn't request this assignment,
captain.

16:44.587 --> 16:46.715
And you can be certain
that when this mission's over,

16:46.923 --> 16:50.971
I'll be as pleased to leave this ship
as you'll be to have me go.

16:55.186 --> 16:56.730
If there's nothing else...

16:57.564 --> 16:59.024
That will be all.

17:08.661 --> 17:12.333
When Zefram Cochrane made his
legendary warp flight 90 years ago...

17:12.540 --> 17:15.588
and drew the attention
of our new friends, the Vulcans,

17:15.796 --> 17:19.885
we realised that we weren't alone
in the galaxy.

17:20.093 --> 17:24.266
Today, we are about to cross
a new threshold.

17:24.474 --> 17:26.935
For nearly a century,
we've waded ankle-deep...

17:27.144 --> 17:28.897
in the ocean of space.

17:29.856 --> 17:32.109
Now it's finally time to swim.

17:39.454 --> 17:41.457
The warp 5 engine
wouldn't be a reality...

17:41.665 --> 17:44.878
without men like Dr Cochrane
and Henry Archer,

17:45.086 --> 17:47.130
who worked so hard to develop it.

17:47.380 --> 17:51.344
So it's only fitting that Henry's son,
Jonathan Archer,

17:51.552 --> 17:54.181
will command the first starship
powered by that engine.

18:07.407 --> 18:09.201
Rather than quoting Dr Cochrane,

18:09.410 --> 18:11.579
I think we should listen
to his own words...

18:11.788 --> 18:17.212
from the dedication ceremony for
the Warp Five Complex, 32 years ago.

18:18.213 --> 18:22.218
On this site,
a powerful engine will be built.

18:22.427 --> 18:24.931
An engine that will someday
help us to travel...

18:25.139 --> 18:28.061
100 times faster than we can today.

18:28.269 --> 18:33.192
Imagine it. Thousands of
inhabited planets at our fingertips.

18:33.400 --> 18:37.197
And we'll be able to explore
those strange new worlds.

18:37.406 --> 18:41.620
And seek out new life
and new civilisations.

18:41.870 --> 18:44.665
This engine will let us go boldly...

18:44.874 --> 18:47.251
where no man has gone before.

19:06.737 --> 19:09.574
Take her out, Mr Mayweather.

19:10.283 --> 19:12.077
Straight and steady.

19:36.067 --> 19:38.570
- How we doing, Trip?
- Ready when you are.

19:38.820 --> 19:40.240
Prepare for warp.

19:40.741 --> 19:42.826
Course laid in, sir.

19:43.035 --> 19:44.913
Request permission
to get under way.

19:45.163 --> 19:47.833
The coordinates are off
by .2 degrees.

19:48.042 --> 19:50.252
Thank you.

19:52.340 --> 19:54.374
Let's go.

20:15.005 --> 20:16.633
Where is Klaang?

20:16.883 --> 20:18.802
The humans have him.

20:19.052 --> 20:21.054
Did you lose anyone else?

20:21.304 --> 20:25.141
Two of my soldiers were killed.
One of them was a friend.

20:25.350 --> 20:27.144
Can you prevent it?

20:27.394 --> 20:31.357
Our agreement doesn't provide
for correcting mistakes.

20:31.565 --> 20:33.193
Recover the evidence.

20:33.818 --> 20:36.697
I will. I promise you.

20:36.948 --> 20:38.866
When will we speak again?

20:39.283 --> 20:42.578
Don't be concerned with when.

20:57.262 --> 20:59.138
Love what you've done
with the place.

20:59.388 --> 21:02.142
Those are immunocytic gel worms.
Try not to shake them.

21:02.392 --> 21:04.646
- What did you think of Earth?
- Intriguing.

21:04.895 --> 21:08.483
I especially liked the Chinese food.
Have you ever tried it?

21:08.733 --> 21:11.569
I've lived in San Francisco
all my life.

21:11.819 --> 21:14.656
Anatomically, you humans
are somewhat simplistic.

21:14.907 --> 21:16.450
But what you lack biologically,

21:16.699 --> 21:18.912
you make up for
with your charming optimism.

21:19.788 --> 21:23.291
Not to mention your egg drop soup.

21:23.666 --> 21:25.544
Be very careful with that.

21:26.962 --> 21:29.965
- What's in there?
- An Altarian marsupial.

21:32.427 --> 21:34.386
Their droppings contain
the greatest concentration...

21:34.595 --> 21:36.306
of regenerative enzymes
found anywhere.

21:36.515 --> 21:37.516
Their droppings?

21:37.974 --> 21:40.977
If you're going to embrace new worlds,
you must try to embrace new ideas.

21:41.269 --> 21:44.857
That's why the Vulcans initiated
the Interspecies Medical Exchange.

21:45.107 --> 21:47.318
There's a lot to be learned.

21:47.610 --> 21:49.988
I'm sorry to take you away
from your program,

21:50.197 --> 21:52.657
but our doctors haven't even heard
of a Klingon.

21:52.907 --> 21:55.661
Please, no apologies.

21:55.869 --> 21:58.080
What better time
to study human beings...

21:58.330 --> 22:00.375
than when they're under pressure?

22:00.583 --> 22:02.126
It's a rare opportunity.

22:02.335 --> 22:04.254
And your Klingon friend...

22:04.463 --> 22:07.967
...l've never had the chance
to examine a living one before.

22:08.176 --> 22:10.302
Ensign Mayweather tells me
that we'll be to Kronos...

22:10.511 --> 22:12.680
in about 80 hours.

22:12.889 --> 22:15.266
Any chance he'll be conscious
by then?

22:15.475 --> 22:18.187
There's a chance he'll be conscious
within the next ten minutes.

22:18.395 --> 22:19.480
Just not a very good one.

22:19.855 --> 22:21.815
Eighty hours, doctor.

22:22.024 --> 22:24.485
If he doesn't walk off this ship
on his own two feet,

22:24.694 --> 22:26.404
he doesn't stand much of a chance.

22:26.613 --> 22:31.576
I'll do the best I can.
Optimism, captain.

22:45.007 --> 22:47.094
You're upside down, ensign.

22:47.303 --> 22:48.638
Yes, sir.

22:48.888 --> 22:50.307
Care to explain why?

22:50.765 --> 22:52.935
When I was a kid,
we called it the sweet spot.

22:53.143 --> 22:55.187
Every ship's got one.

22:55.395 --> 22:56.772
Sweet spot?

22:57.022 --> 23:00.985
It's usually about halfway between
the grav generator and the bow plate.

23:01.194 --> 23:03.821
Grab ahold of the hatch.

23:04.030 --> 23:05.657
No, no, no, on either side.

23:07.326 --> 23:08.868
Now, push off.

23:10.579 --> 23:12.664
Push off.

23:22.592 --> 23:24.720
Takes practice.

23:31.145 --> 23:33.605
You ever slept in zero G?

23:33.813 --> 23:35.191
Slept?

23:35.399 --> 23:37.234
It's just like being back in the womb.

23:42.491 --> 23:44.742
The captain tells me you've been
to Trillius Prime.

23:45.494 --> 23:47.788
Took fourth, fifth and sixth grades
to get there.

23:47.996 --> 23:51.083
I've also been to Draylax
and both the Teneebian Moons.

23:51.541 --> 23:54.921
I've only been to one inhabited planet
besides Earth.

23:55.128 --> 23:56.923
Nothing there
but dust-dwelling ticks.

23:59.343 --> 24:01.260
I've heard the women
on Draylax have...

24:01.511 --> 24:03.013
Three.

24:03.222 --> 24:04.431
Yeah, it's true.

24:04.681 --> 24:06.226
You know that firsthand?

24:06.808 --> 24:09.896
Firsthand, secondhand, thirdhand.

24:10.146 --> 24:12.648
I guess growing up a boomer
has its advantages.

24:18.864 --> 24:20.241
Got an empty seat here, commander.

24:20.450 --> 24:23.704
Sorry. Dinner with the boss tonight.

24:23.954 --> 24:26.623
- Grand Canyon?
- No.

24:27.249 --> 24:28.918
Big Sur Aquarium?

24:29.126 --> 24:32.004
Sightseeing was not
one of my assignments.

24:33.005 --> 24:35.759
All work and no play.

24:35.967 --> 24:39.471
Everybody should get out
for a little fun now and then.

24:39.679 --> 24:43.767
All our recreational needs
are provided at the compound.

24:43.975 --> 24:45.895
Come in.

24:46.103 --> 24:49.148
- Should have started without me.
- Sit down.

24:49.732 --> 24:54.070
T'Pol tells me she's been living
at the Vulcan Compound in Sausalito.

24:54.278 --> 24:55.864
No kidding.

24:56.073 --> 24:59.577
I lived a few blocks from there
when I first joined Starfleet.

24:59.786 --> 25:02.623
Great parties
at the Vulcan Compound.

25:07.795 --> 25:10.090
It might be a little easier
using your fingers.

25:11.298 --> 25:13.551
Vulcans don't touch food
with their hands.

25:15.261 --> 25:17.305
Can't wait to see you tackle
the spareribs.

25:17.305 --> 25:18.348
Can't wait to see you tackle
the spareribs.

25:19.140 --> 25:21.227
Don't worry.
We know you're a vegetarian.

25:26.065 --> 25:27.943
Looks delicious.

25:28.151 --> 25:31.821
- Tell chef I said thanks.
- Of course, sir.

25:32.864 --> 25:34.659
You humans claim
to be enlightened,

25:34.866 --> 25:37.078
yet you still consume the flesh
of animals.

25:37.286 --> 25:40.748
Grandma taught me never to judge
a species by their eating habits.

25:41.332 --> 25:43.042
"Enlightened" might be
too strong a word,

25:43.250 --> 25:45.088
but if you'd been on Earth
50 years ago,

25:45.296 --> 25:47.465
I think you'd be impressed
by what we've gotten done.

25:47.715 --> 25:49.967
You have yet to embrace
either patience or logic.

25:50.176 --> 25:52.137
You remain impulsive carnivores.

25:52.386 --> 25:54.848
Yeah? How about war?

25:55.057 --> 25:56.350
Disease? Hunger?

25:56.558 --> 25:59.061
Pretty much wiped them out
in less than two generations.

25:59.311 --> 26:01.104
I wouldn't call that small potatoes.

26:01.355 --> 26:03.024
It remains to be seen
whether humanity...

26:03.232 --> 26:05.360
will revert to its baser instincts.

26:05.610 --> 26:08.447
Well, we used to have
cannibals on Earth.

26:08.697 --> 26:10.406
Who knows how far we'll revert?

26:10.948 --> 26:12.242
Lucky this isn't a long mission.

26:12.951 --> 26:14.536
Human instinct is pretty strong.

26:14.787 --> 26:16.497
You can't expect us
to change overnight.

26:16.705 --> 26:19.501
With proper discipline...

26:21.627 --> 26:23.254
...anything's possible.

26:33.517 --> 26:36.604
Warp 4.3, sir.

26:37.688 --> 26:38.898
Not much of a change.

26:39.189 --> 26:41.651
I don't know.
Does anybody else feel that?

26:41.901 --> 26:45.321
- Feel what?
- Those vibrations, like little tremors.

26:45.613 --> 26:47.741
You're imagining it.

26:48.241 --> 26:51.161
Bring us to 4.4, ensign.

26:52.996 --> 26:54.207
There. What do you call that?

26:54.499 --> 26:57.334
The deflector's sequencing.
It's perfectly normal.

26:57.794 --> 27:01.298
Perhaps you'd like to go
to your quarters and lie down.

27:04.008 --> 27:06.762
I was instructed to speak English
on this voyage,

27:07.012 --> 27:09.556
and I'd appreciate it
if you'd respect that.

27:09.848 --> 27:11.225
It's easy to get a little jumpy

27:11.434 --> 27:14.520
when you're travelling
at 30 million kilometres a second.

27:14.729 --> 27:17.983
Should be old hat in a week's time.

27:19.444 --> 27:21.905
- Archer.
- This is Dr Phlox, captain.

27:22.155 --> 27:24.199
Our patient is
regaining consciousness.

27:24.449 --> 27:27.369
On my way. Hoshi?

27:31.499 --> 27:32.750
What's wrong?

27:33.000 --> 27:36.838
The translator,
it's not locking on to his dialect.

27:37.047 --> 27:39.215
The syntax won't align.

27:40.842 --> 27:43.179
Tell him we're taking him home.

27:48.601 --> 27:51.145
He wants to know who we are.

27:58.404 --> 28:01.699
- Ship, he's asking for his ship back.
- Say it was destroyed.

28:08.207 --> 28:13.504
I'm not sure, but I think he said
something about eating the afterlife?

28:13.712 --> 28:15.423
Try the translator again.

28:18.761 --> 28:22.014
I'm gonna need to run what we've got
through the phonetic processor.

28:23.933 --> 28:27.686
He says his wife has grown ugly?

28:28.145 --> 28:31.148
I am sorry, captain,
I'm doing the best I can.

28:31.398 --> 28:34.110
Excuse me. His prefrontal cortex
is hyperstimulated.

28:34.319 --> 28:36.696
I doubt he has any idea
what he's saying.

28:38.949 --> 28:41.411
I think the doctor's right, captain,

28:41.620 --> 28:44.915
unless "stinky boots"
has something to do with all this.

28:47.210 --> 28:50.171
That's the warp reactor again, right?

28:50.963 --> 28:52.256
Bridge, report.

28:52.465 --> 28:54.009
We've dropped out of warp, sir.

28:54.217 --> 28:55.843
Main power...

29:00.224 --> 29:02.976
We're losing power on all decks.

29:03.645 --> 29:05.647
I think I just saw something
off the starboard bow.

29:05.896 --> 29:07.357
- What?
- I don't know.

29:07.565 --> 29:09.484
It might have just been
the sensors going down.

29:18.869 --> 29:21.915
Auxiliary power should have kicked in
by now.

29:25.002 --> 29:26.670
Do you know how to tell him
to shut up?

29:26.879 --> 29:28.173
Shut up!

29:30.341 --> 29:32.886
You may have to sedate him.
I need to get to the bridge.

29:35.263 --> 29:37.557
Captain.

29:37.807 --> 29:39.101
There's someone here.

30:19.355 --> 30:21.232
Crewman.

30:22.524 --> 30:24.569
Suliban.

30:44.090 --> 30:46.593
- You all right?
- Yeah.

31:05.783 --> 31:09.578
We've got state-of-the-art sensors.
Why the hell didn't we detect them?

31:09.787 --> 31:13.083
Mr Reed thought he detected
something right before we lost power.

31:13.291 --> 31:16.001
The starboard sensor logs recorded
a spatial disturbance.

31:16.211 --> 31:17.962
Looks more like a glitch.

31:18.213 --> 31:20.508
Those weren't glitches in Sickbay.

31:20.716 --> 31:23.219
I want a complete analysis
of that disturbance.

31:24.345 --> 31:27.389
- Where do we stand on weapons?
- I have to tune the targeting scanners.

31:27.848 --> 31:29.975
- What are you waiting for?
- Captain...

31:30.185 --> 31:31.895
The Klingon seemed to know
who they were.

31:32.103 --> 31:35.190
- See if you can translate what he said.
- Right away.

31:35.398 --> 31:36.692
Captain.

31:36.901 --> 31:39.111
There's no way
you could have anticipated this.

31:39.320 --> 31:41.698
I'm sure Ambassador Soval
will understand.

31:42.074 --> 31:43.617
You're the science officer.

31:43.825 --> 31:45.535
Why don't you help Trip
with that analysis.

31:45.744 --> 31:47.622
The astrometric computer
in San Francisco...

31:47.830 --> 31:49.123
will be far more effective.

31:49.332 --> 31:52.543
We're not going to San Francisco,
so make do with what we've got here.

31:52.752 --> 31:56.172
You've lost the Klingon.
Your mission is over.

31:56.422 --> 31:58.300
I didn't lose the Klingon.
He was taken.

31:58.550 --> 32:00.844
And I'm going to find out
who took him.

32:01.136 --> 32:05.015
How do you plan to do that?
Space is very big, captain.

32:05.266 --> 32:07.352
A shadow on your sensors
won't help you find them.

32:07.602 --> 32:09.062
This is a foolish mission.

32:10.480 --> 32:12.023
Come with me.

32:17.237 --> 32:19.656
I'm not interested in what you think
about this mission.

32:19.907 --> 32:21.951
So take your Vulcan cynicism
and bury it...

32:22.202 --> 32:23.579
along with your repressed emotions.

32:24.371 --> 32:26.791
Your reaction to this situation
is a perfect example...

32:27.041 --> 32:29.795
of why your species should remain
in its own star system.

32:30.045 --> 32:33.965
I've been listening to you Vulcans
tell us what not to do my entire life.

32:34.216 --> 32:36.968
I watched my father work his ass off
while your scientists held back...

32:37.219 --> 32:39.888
just enough information
to keep him from succeeding.

32:40.598 --> 32:42.642
He deserved to see that launch.

32:42.849 --> 32:45.519
You may have life spans of 200 years,
we don't.

32:45.728 --> 32:47.689
You are going
to be contacting Starfleet...

32:47.940 --> 32:49.482
to advise them of our situation.

32:49.732 --> 32:52.486
No, I'm not, and neither are you.

32:52.736 --> 32:55.489
Now get the hell out there
and make yourself useful.

33:05.460 --> 33:06.710
What have you found, doctor?

33:06.919 --> 33:09.798
Mr Klaang was right about one thing.
He is a Suliban.

33:10.006 --> 33:12.467
But unless I'm mistaken,
he is no ordinary one.

33:12.675 --> 33:14.761
- Meaning?
- His DNA is Suliban,

33:14.970 --> 33:16.805
but his anatomy has been altered.

33:17.014 --> 33:19.767
Look at this lung.

33:20.517 --> 33:22.395
Five bronchial lobes, you see.

33:22.771 --> 33:24.647
It should only have three.

33:24.855 --> 33:27.192
And look at the alveoli clusters.

33:27.400 --> 33:30.695
They've been modified to process
different kinds of atmosphere.

33:30.945 --> 33:32.907
Are you saying he's some kind
of a mutant?

33:33.157 --> 33:35.576
Well, I suppose I am,
but this was no accident.

33:35.784 --> 33:38.370
No freak of nature.
This man was the recipient...

33:38.621 --> 33:41.791
of some very sophisticated
genetic engineering.

33:41.999 --> 33:43.919
Watch this.

33:45.420 --> 33:47.714
Subcutaneous pigment sacs.

33:51.303 --> 33:55.432
A bio-mimetic garment.
And the eyes are my favourite.

33:58.186 --> 33:59.478
Compound retinas.

33:59.686 --> 34:02.565
He most likely saw things
even your sensors couldn't detect.

34:02.815 --> 34:04.693
- It's not in their genome?
- No, certainly not.

34:04.902 --> 34:06.653
The Suliban are no more evolved
than humans.

34:06.861 --> 34:10.822
It is very impressive work, though.
Never seen anything quite like it.

34:11.283 --> 34:12.409
How about this?

34:12.618 --> 34:14.078
It's just background noise.

34:14.286 --> 34:16.623
Your sensors aren't capable
of isolating plasma decay.

34:16.830 --> 34:19.583
How can you be so damn sure
what our sensors can do?

34:19.793 --> 34:23.713
Vulcan children play with toys
that are more sophisticated.

34:23.922 --> 34:28.092
You know, some people say you
Vulcans do nothing but patronise us.

34:28.302 --> 34:30.387
But if they were here now,
if they could see how far...

34:30.596 --> 34:34.434
you're bending over backwards
to help me, they would eat their words.

34:34.643 --> 34:37.772
Your captain's mission
was to return the Klingon to his people.

34:37.980 --> 34:39.940
He no longer has the Klingon.

34:40.149 --> 34:42.610
I realise he's only a simple earthling,

34:42.819 --> 34:45.447
but did it ever occur to you
that he might know what he's doing?

34:45.655 --> 34:48.699
It's no secret Starfleet hasn't been
around too long.

34:48.909 --> 34:51.788
God knows you remind us of that
every chance you get.

34:51.995 --> 34:54.665
But does that mean the man who's
been put in charge of this mission...

34:54.873 --> 34:57.002
doesn't deserve our support?

34:57.211 --> 35:00.631
Then again, loyalty's an emotion.

35:00.839 --> 35:02.216
Isn't it?

35:02.424 --> 35:04.593
Any luck?

35:04.801 --> 35:06.011
Not really.

35:06.261 --> 35:08.723
My analysis of the spatial disturbance
Mr Reed saw

35:08.932 --> 35:12.060
indicates a stealth vessel
with a tricyclic plasma drive.

35:12.268 --> 35:14.313
If we can figure out the decay rate
of their plasma,

35:14.521 --> 35:16.147
we'll be able to find their warp trail.

35:16.356 --> 35:19.653
Unfortunately, your sensors were not
designed to measure plasma decay.

35:19.861 --> 35:23.323
Are you sure it's safe
to stand so close to that?

35:23.531 --> 35:25.242
What have you got?

35:25.451 --> 35:27.452
I've managed to translate
most of what Klaang said,

35:27.660 --> 35:28.829
but none of it makes sense.

35:29.038 --> 35:31.917
- Nothing about the Suliban?
- Nope.

35:32.125 --> 35:33.709
Does that name ring a bell to you?

35:34.043 --> 35:37.005
They're a somewhat primitive species
from Sector 3641,

35:37.214 --> 35:38.924
but they've never posed a threat.

35:39.174 --> 35:41.301
Well, they have now.

35:41.510 --> 35:42.929
Did he say anything about Earth?

35:43.137 --> 35:44.597
The word's not even
in their database.

35:44.804 --> 35:47.516
It's all there. There are only
four words that I couldn't translate.

35:47.725 --> 35:49.478
Probably just proper nouns.

35:49.686 --> 35:54.232
"Jelik, Sarin, Rigel, Tholia."

35:54.441 --> 35:56.735
Anything sound familiar?

35:59.489 --> 36:01.617
T'Pol?

36:01.825 --> 36:03.827
Rigel is a planetary system.

36:04.036 --> 36:06.831
Approximately 15 light-years
from our present position.

36:07.040 --> 36:08.248
Why the hesitation?

36:08.957 --> 36:12.003
According to the navigational logs
salvaged from Klaang's ship,

36:12.212 --> 36:16.800
Rigel Ten was the last place he stopped
before crashing on your planet.

36:17.009 --> 36:18.886
Why do I get the feeling
you weren't gonna share...

36:19.094 --> 36:20.512
that little piece of information?

36:20.721 --> 36:23.682
I wasn't authorised to reveal
the details of our findings.

36:24.392 --> 36:27.186
The next time I learn
you're withholding something,

36:27.395 --> 36:29.022
you're gonna spend
the rest of this voyage...

36:29.230 --> 36:31.983
confined to some very cramped
quarters. Understood?

36:34.654 --> 36:36.364
- Archer to helm.
- Mayweather.

36:36.572 --> 36:40.159
Go into the Vulcan star charts
and find a system called Rigel.

36:40.367 --> 36:42.370
Then set a course
for the tenth planet.

36:42.579 --> 36:44.121
Yes, sir.

37:07.273 --> 37:09.318
Are you certain he's telling the truth?

37:09.526 --> 37:12.738
Absolutely certain.
The drugs are working.

37:47.653 --> 37:50.322
Keep him alive while I'm gone.

38:02.878 --> 38:06.131
As soon as we've tied down, we'll be
descending into the trade complex.

38:06.340 --> 38:07.883
It has 36 levels.

38:08.133 --> 38:10.345
Your translators have been
programmed for Rigelian.

38:10.595 --> 38:12.890
However, you'll encounter numerous
other species.

38:13.140 --> 38:16.645
Many of them are known
to be impatient with newcomers.

38:16.895 --> 38:19.481
None of them have seen
a human before.

38:19.898 --> 38:21.691
You have a tendency
to be gregarious.

38:21.900 --> 38:25.236
I suggest you try to restrain
that tendency.

38:25.528 --> 38:27.990
You forgot to warn us
about drinking the water.

38:28.407 --> 38:31.327
Dr Phlox isn't concerned
with the food and water.

38:31.535 --> 38:34.456
But he does caution
against intimate contact.

38:35.790 --> 38:38.710
The Vulcans told us Klaang
was a courier.

38:38.960 --> 38:41.171
If he was there to get something,
whoever gave it to him...

38:41.379 --> 38:42.964
might know why he was taken.

38:43.423 --> 38:45.009
It was just a few days ago.

38:45.218 --> 38:48.346
A 7-foot Klingon
doesn't go unnoticed.

39:55.172 --> 39:56.923
What in the world...?

39:58.926 --> 40:01.804
It's nothing that concerns us.

40:40.890 --> 40:45.061
Would you like to meet them?
I can arrange it.

40:45.269 --> 40:46.730
Is this where you saw Klaang?

40:46.980 --> 40:52.235
I'll show you where,
but first you should enjoy yourselves.

40:52.444 --> 40:55.031
Which one would you prefer?

40:55.448 --> 40:56.783
We should get going.

40:57.575 --> 41:01.246
Are those real butterflies
or some kind of holograms?

41:03.582 --> 41:05.000
Sir.

41:05.209 --> 41:09.255
Oh, yes. Absolutely. You're right.

41:57.727 --> 41:59.688
- T'Pol to Archer.
- Go ahead.

41:59.897 --> 42:02.190
- Hey.
- Central Security claims to have...

42:02.440 --> 42:03.692
no record of Klaang.

42:03.901 --> 42:06.194
But they told me about an enclave
on Level 19,

42:06.402 --> 42:10.033
where Klingons have been known
to go, something about live food.

42:10.241 --> 42:11.576
Where on Level 19?

42:11.784 --> 42:15.163
The easternmost subsection,
by the geothermal shafts.

42:15.789 --> 42:17.957
- I'll meet you as soon as I can.
- What are you doing?

42:18.208 --> 42:20.210
- Leave the kid alone.
- Don't get involved.

42:20.419 --> 42:22.296
You see what she's doing?
He's gonna suffocate.

42:22.505 --> 42:23.671
They're Lorillians.

42:23.880 --> 42:26.342
Before the age of 4,
they can only breathe methyl oxide.

42:26.550 --> 42:30.095
The mother is simply weaning
her son.

42:30.304 --> 42:31.723
Could have fooled me.

42:31.932 --> 42:34.602
Humans can't refrain
from drawing conclusions.

42:34.852 --> 42:37.103
You should learn to objectify
other cultures.

42:37.312 --> 42:41.568
So you know when to interfere
and when not to.

42:56.043 --> 42:58.587
Isn't an enclave
supposed to have people?

42:58.794 --> 43:01.006
Enclave can mean a lot of things.

43:01.215 --> 43:06.346
T'Pol said something about live food.
I don't see any restaurants.

43:07.305 --> 43:09.265
Hello!

43:10.934 --> 43:13.145
Excuse me.

43:15.356 --> 43:17.900
They look Klingon to me.

43:23.699 --> 43:25.785
Archer to T'Pol.

43:28.788 --> 43:30.749
T'Pol, come in.

43:32.083 --> 43:35.212
Maybe we should get back
to where there are more people.

43:36.780 --> 43:39.799
There are plenty of people
right here.

43:42.578 --> 43:45.051
Stay behind me.

44:51.694 --> 44:53.655
You're looking for Klaang.

44:53.864 --> 44:56.617
- Why?
- Who the hell are you?

44:57.367 --> 44:59.412
My name is Sarin.

45:00.245 --> 45:02.874
Tell me about the people
who took Klaang off your ship.

45:03.833 --> 45:06.294
I was hoping you could tell me.

45:06.502 --> 45:08.880
They looked a lot
like your friends outside.

45:09.088 --> 45:10.423
Where were you taking him?

45:11.507 --> 45:13.260
Why don't you look like your friends?

45:13.719 --> 45:16.472
Would you prefer I did?

45:16.722 --> 45:19.641
What I'd prefer is you give me
Klaang back.

45:19.893 --> 45:21.810
So you could take him where?

45:22.019 --> 45:24.355
Home.

45:24.564 --> 45:26.983
We were just taking him home.

45:29.736 --> 45:32.614
You better be careful.
I'm a lot bigger than you are.

45:32.864 --> 45:37.078
If you're thinking of harming me,
I'd advise against it.

45:39.289 --> 45:40.791
What are you doing?

45:41.917 --> 45:44.837
Why were you taking Klaang home?

45:46.881 --> 45:48.799
You know,
under different circumstances,

45:49.008 --> 45:51.553
I might be flattered by this, but...

46:02.857 --> 46:06.110
That's never happened before.

46:08.655 --> 46:10.948
I've been given the ability
to measure trust,

46:11.157 --> 46:13.201
but it requires close contact.

46:13.452 --> 46:14.827
You're Suliban.

46:15.077 --> 46:18.332
I was a member of the Cabal,
but not any longer.

46:18.540 --> 46:21.127
The price of evolution was too high.

46:21.586 --> 46:23.088
Evolution?

46:23.297 --> 46:26.216
Some of my people are so anxious
to improve themselves...

46:26.425 --> 46:28.385
that they've lost perspective.

46:28.635 --> 46:31.805
So you know I'm not lying to you.
Now what?

46:32.181 --> 46:34.559
Klaang was carrying a message
to his people.

46:34.809 --> 46:37.270
- How do you know that?
- I gave it to him.

46:37.645 --> 46:39.063
What kind of message?

46:39.314 --> 46:42.400
The Suliban have been staging attacks
within The Klingon Empire.

46:42.609 --> 46:45.362
Making it appear that one faction
is attacking another.

46:45.571 --> 46:48.157
Klaang was bringing proof of this
to his High Council.

46:48.365 --> 46:51.910
Without that proof,
the empire could be thrown into chaos.

46:52.119 --> 46:54.079
Why would the Suliban want that?

46:54.289 --> 46:56.541
The Cabal doesn't make decisions
on its own.

46:56.750 --> 46:59.627
They're simply soldiers
fighting a Temporal Cold War.

46:59.878 --> 47:01.547
Temporal?

47:01.756 --> 47:03.257
You've lost me.

47:03.507 --> 47:06.053
They're taking orders
from the distant future.

47:07.012 --> 47:08.847
- What?
- We can help you find Klaang,

47:09.097 --> 47:11.934
but we don't have a starship.
You'll have to take us with you.

47:44.470 --> 47:47.849
- Where's your vessel?
- On the roof, Docking Port 3.

47:48.099 --> 47:49.559
This way.

48:20.843 --> 48:22.596
Trip.

48:28.727 --> 48:30.770
Find Klaang.

48:56.382 --> 48:57.926
Where's the pod?

48:58.135 --> 49:00.429
- Over here.
- No, it's this way.

49:02.139 --> 49:04.058
Come on.

49:07.937 --> 49:10.608
Lieutenant Reed, this is Archer.
Come in.

49:11.316 --> 49:12.984
You're breaking up.
Can you hear me?

49:13.234 --> 49:14.612
We're on the roof.

49:14.820 --> 49:16.530
You need to get up here
as quickly as...

49:19.409 --> 49:20.953
We've been trying to reach you,
captain.

49:21.162 --> 49:23.246
- We're back in the shuttle.
- Ask him where they are.

49:23.538 --> 49:26.375
- This storm's getting worse.
- Captain, what's your location?

49:26.584 --> 49:27.625
The weather is definitely...

49:32.882 --> 49:35.552
- Great.
- Like I said, it's back there.

50:04.792 --> 50:07.337
I've never seen lightning
in a snowstorm before.

50:07.629 --> 50:10.632
The storm's kicking up
too much interference.

50:12.092 --> 50:14.053
I can't isolate human bio-signs.

50:14.262 --> 50:15.888
They could be anywhere
in the complex.

50:16.138 --> 50:17.807
Try Vulcan bio-signs.

50:22.478 --> 50:24.690
I found her.

50:47.465 --> 50:49.259
Get Hoshi to the ship.

50:50.936 --> 50:52.679
Now.

51:06.887 --> 51:08.088
Go.

51:08.195 --> 51:10.324
Enterprise needs its captain.
Give me the weapons.

51:10.532 --> 51:11.992
I said, go.

51:46.905 --> 51:50.493
- The starboard thruster's down.
- Ignore it. Take us up.

52:00.129 --> 52:02.715
We need instructions.

52:02.965 --> 52:04.967
Open a channel.

52:05.176 --> 52:07.553
- Subcommander T'Pol to Enterprise.
- Go ahead.

52:08.053 --> 52:11.183
We'll be docking in four minutes.
Have Dr Phlox meet us in Decon.

52:11.391 --> 52:13.811
Acknowledged.
Is someone wounded?

52:14.270 --> 52:15.981
The captain.

52:16.189 --> 52:18.190
I'm taking command of Enterprise.

52:31.414 --> 52:33.584
- I can't do it.
- Yes, you can.

52:33.791 --> 52:36.210
Take her up, straight and steady.

52:44.553 --> 52:45.804
Damn.

52:51.436 --> 52:56.108
You can't be afraid of the wind.
Learn to trust it.

53:05.494 --> 53:08.163
It shouldn't take more
than a few moments.

53:08.873 --> 53:10.291
Is this really necessary?

53:10.499 --> 53:11.624
The others scanned negative.

53:11.834 --> 53:14.837
You two, unfortunately,
were exposed to a protocystian spore.

53:15.087 --> 53:18.090
I've loaded the appropriate decon gel
into compartment B.

53:18.299 --> 53:21.178
Tell Mr Mayweather to prepare
to leave orbit.

53:21.386 --> 53:23.722
- How's the captain?
- I'm treating his wound.

53:23.930 --> 53:27.434
- Will he be all right?
- Eventually.

53:47.958 --> 53:50.335
Correct me if I'm wrong,

53:50.544 --> 53:53.338
but aren't you just kind of an observer
on this mission?

53:53.547 --> 53:57.177
I don't remember anyone telling me
you were a member of Starfleet.

53:57.385 --> 53:59.553
My Vulcan rank supersedes yours.

53:59.761 --> 54:01.306
Apples and oranges.

54:01.556 --> 54:04.226
This is an Earth vessel.
You're in no position to take command.

54:04.434 --> 54:07.353
As soon as we're through here,
I'll contact Ambassador Soval.

54:07.562 --> 54:09.356
He'll speak to your superiors,

54:09.607 --> 54:13.027
and I'm certain they will support
my authority in this situation.

54:15.738 --> 54:19.034
You must really be proud of yourself.

54:19.242 --> 54:20.576
You can put an end to this mission...

54:20.784 --> 54:23.663
while the captain's still unconscious
in Sickbay.

54:23.873 --> 54:26.208
You won't even have to look him
in the eye.

54:27.126 --> 54:28.962
Your precious cargo was stolen,

54:29.337 --> 54:31.630
three Suliban, perhaps more,
were killed,

54:31.839 --> 54:34.384
and Captain Archer
has been seriously wounded.

54:34.593 --> 54:38.305
It seems, to me, this mission
has put an end to itself.

54:38.513 --> 54:40.641
Turn around.

54:44.645 --> 54:46.440
Let's say you're right.

54:46.690 --> 54:49.442
Let's say we screwed up
just like you always knew we would.

54:49.693 --> 54:52.445
It's still a good bet that whoever
blew that hole in the captain's leg

54:52.695 --> 54:55.699
is connected somehow
to the people that took Klaang.

54:55.949 --> 54:58.285
I fail to see your point.

54:58.535 --> 55:00.955
Captain Archer deserves a chance
to see this through.

55:01.205 --> 55:03.290
If you knew him, you'd realise
that's what he's about.

55:03.540 --> 55:06.210
He needs to finish what he starts.

55:06.419 --> 55:08.131
His daddy was the same way.

55:08.881 --> 55:11.426
You obviously share
your captain's belief that my people...

55:11.676 --> 55:14.596
were responsible for impeding
Henry Archer's accomplishments.

55:14.846 --> 55:18.976
He only wanted to see
his engine fly.

55:19.225 --> 55:21.729
They never even gave him
the chance to fail.

55:21.979 --> 55:25.316
And here you are, 30 years later,
proving just how consistent...

55:25.566 --> 55:27.860
you Vulcans can be.

55:45.589 --> 55:47.381
Very nice.

55:47.590 --> 55:51.011
Very nice.
Your myofibers are fusing beautifully.

55:51.260 --> 55:53.556
- How long have...?
- Less than six hours.

55:53.806 --> 55:56.351
I thought it best to keep you sedated
while the osmotic eel...

55:56.601 --> 55:58.144
cauterised your wound.

55:59.353 --> 56:01.356
Thanks.

56:03.191 --> 56:04.901
How you doing, captain?

56:05.110 --> 56:06.612
Well, that depends.

56:06.821 --> 56:08.655
What's been going on
the last six hours?

56:08.864 --> 56:10.116
As your highest ranking officer,

56:10.366 --> 56:12.452
I assumed command
while you were incapacitated.

56:13.536 --> 56:16.038
Are we under way?

56:17.374 --> 56:19.667
You didn't waste much time,
did you?

56:19.876 --> 56:21.295
Is he fit to resume command?

56:21.503 --> 56:24.339
As long as he returns
for more eel therapy tomorrow.

56:24.882 --> 56:26.758
How long before we get back
to Earth?

56:26.967 --> 56:28.011
Earth, sir?

56:28.219 --> 56:29.887
We're currently tracking
the Suliban vessel

56:30.095 --> 56:32.599
that left Rigel
shortly after you were injured.

56:35.310 --> 56:39.149
You got their plasma decay rate?

56:39.398 --> 56:42.152
With Mr Tucker's assistance,
I modified your sensors.

56:42.360 --> 56:46.406
We now have the resolution
to detect their warp trail.

56:47.407 --> 56:49.660
What happened to,
"This is a foolish mission"?

56:49.869 --> 56:51.996
This is a foolish mission.

56:52.204 --> 56:57.084
The Suliban are clearly a hostile race
with technology far superior to yours.

56:57.293 --> 57:00.589
But as acting captain, I was obligated
to anticipate your wishes.

57:00.838 --> 57:05.427
As acting captain, you could have done
whatever the hell you wanted to do.

57:05.635 --> 57:07.470
I should return to the bridge.

57:09.599 --> 57:11.808
Dismissed.

57:14.520 --> 57:19.985
Modifying the sensors
was her idea, sir.

57:23.990 --> 57:26.117
Enterprise starlog,
Captain Jonathan Archer.

57:26.325 --> 57:29.537
April 16th, 2151.

57:29.746 --> 57:32.082
We've been tracking the Suliban ship
for ten hours,

57:32.291 --> 57:35.586
thanks to our science officer,
who came up with a way...

57:35.794 --> 57:38.005
to tweak the sensors.

57:38.964 --> 57:41.259
Computer, pause.

57:41.467 --> 57:44.386
I save her life,
now she's helping us with the mission.

57:44.637 --> 57:49.517
"One good turn deserves another."
Doesn't sound very Vulcan.

57:49.726 --> 57:51.185
Resume log.

57:53.439 --> 57:56.608
I have no reason to believe
that Klaang is still alive,

57:56.817 --> 57:59.486
but if what the Suliban woman
told me is true,

57:59.695 --> 58:02.490
it's crucial that we try to find him.

58:02.699 --> 58:03.908
Computer, pause.

58:04.117 --> 58:07.121
Have you ever known a Vulcan
to return a favour?

58:08.080 --> 58:11.167
No. Neither have I.

58:12.126 --> 58:13.420
Resume log.

58:14.212 --> 58:16.631
I still haven't decided whether
to ask Subcommander T'Pol

58:16.840 --> 58:20.553
about this Temporal Cold War.

58:20.760 --> 58:24.181
My instincts tell me not to trust her.

58:25.516 --> 58:27.810
Computer, pause.

58:28.019 --> 58:30.647
Archer to T'Pol. Report.

58:30.856 --> 58:33.316
If you're feeling well enough
to come to the bridge, captain,

58:33.525 --> 58:35.819
now would be a good time.

58:44.912 --> 58:46.706
It's a gas giant.

58:46.914 --> 58:50.127
From the looks of it,
a Class 6 or 7.

58:50.335 --> 58:51.713
Class 7.

58:51.921 --> 58:55.300
The Suliban vessel dropped to impulse
a few hours ago and altered course.

58:55.508 --> 58:58.678
Their new heading took them through
its outer radiation belt.

58:59.012 --> 59:01.473
- We've lost them.
- Yes.

59:04.267 --> 59:06.395
Move us in closer.

59:13.445 --> 59:15.279
Anything?

59:15.488 --> 59:17.907
The radiation's dissipated
their warp trail.

59:18.116 --> 59:19.951
I'm only picking up fragments.

59:20.368 --> 59:22.036
You finished helping us?

59:27.918 --> 59:31.755
Lieutenant, run a spectral analysis
of the fragments.

59:34.427 --> 59:37.805
There's too much distortion.
The decay rates don't even match.

59:43.019 --> 59:45.397
Calculate the trajectory
of each fragment.

59:46.522 --> 59:48.233
Sir?

59:48.442 --> 59:50.486
You heard her.

59:50.695 --> 59:54.240
Recalibrate the sensor array.
Narrow band, short to midrange.

59:54.449 --> 59:56.242
Aye, sir.

59:56.492 --> 01:00:00.163
Measure the particle density
of the thermosphere.

01:00:02.124 --> 01:00:03.583
Your instincts were right.

01:00:03.791 --> 01:00:06.503
Those fragments
weren't from one Suliban ship.

01:00:06.712 --> 01:00:09.673
They were from 14,
and all within the last six hours.

01:00:09.882 --> 01:00:12.302
I believe we have found
what we're looking for.

01:00:14.678 --> 01:00:16.432
How are your targeting scanners?

01:00:16.640 --> 01:00:19.268
Aligned and ready, sir.

01:00:22.564 --> 01:00:25.942
Bring the weapons online.
And polarise the hull plating.

01:00:26.192 --> 01:00:28.863
Lay in a 60-degree vector.

01:00:29.070 --> 01:00:31.239
We're going in.

01:00:35.953 --> 01:00:38.289
Did Sarin give them anything?

01:00:38.539 --> 01:00:39.915
I don't know.

01:00:40.166 --> 01:00:41.709
What do you know?

01:00:42.126 --> 01:00:43.753
They followed us here.

01:00:44.004 --> 01:00:46.088
Looking for Klaang or for you?

01:00:46.381 --> 01:00:51.344
I don't know, but I will destroy them
before they locate the Helix.

01:00:51.636 --> 01:00:57.310
We didn't plan to involve the humans
or the Vulcans, not yet.

01:00:57.768 --> 01:01:00.939
Sarin's message
cannot reach Kronos.

01:01:01.189 --> 01:01:04.694
If the humans have it,
you must stop them.

01:01:12.201 --> 01:01:14.955
Sensor resolution's falling off
at about 12 kilometres.

01:01:15.164 --> 01:01:17.916
- Travis?
- I'm okay, captain.

01:01:18.167 --> 01:01:19.251
Our situation should improve.

01:01:19.501 --> 01:01:22.838
We're about to break through
the cyclohexane layer.

01:01:24.214 --> 01:01:27.218
I wouldn't exactly call this
an improvement.

01:01:28.219 --> 01:01:29.762
Liquid phosphorus.

01:01:29.971 --> 01:01:33.725
I wouldn't have expected that
beneath a layer of cyclohexane.

01:01:34.392 --> 01:01:36.687
You might recommend
seat belts when we get home.

01:01:36.937 --> 01:01:39.606
It's just a little bad weather.

01:01:42.360 --> 01:01:44.988
- We've got sensors.
- Level off.

01:01:45.196 --> 01:01:46.949
Go to long-range scans.

01:01:48.325 --> 01:01:51.829
I'm detecting two vessels,
bearing 119, mark 7.

01:01:52.329 --> 01:01:54.166
Put it up.

01:01:58.044 --> 01:02:00.422
- Impulse and warp engines.
- What kind of weapons?

01:02:00.672 --> 01:02:01.673
We're too far away.

01:02:01.923 --> 01:02:06.595
Sir, I'm picking up something
at 342, mark 12.

01:02:06.804 --> 01:02:08.180
It's a lot bigger.

01:02:13.436 --> 01:02:15.314
All sensors...

01:02:15.522 --> 01:02:17.023
...get whatever you can.

01:02:20.737 --> 01:02:22.028
Go tighter.

01:02:25.408 --> 01:02:26.533
Bio-signs?

01:02:26.741 --> 01:02:30.539
Over 3,000, but I can't isolate
a Klingon if there is one.

01:02:32.374 --> 01:02:34.376
That was a particle weapon, sir.

01:02:35.128 --> 01:02:37.671
Bridge, we're taking damage
down here. What's going on?

01:02:37.880 --> 01:02:39.716
Just a little trouble with the bad guys.

01:02:39.924 --> 01:02:43.011
I suggest we return
to the phosphorus layer.

01:02:44.804 --> 01:02:46.599
Take us up.

01:02:54.648 --> 01:02:55.859
Captain.

01:02:57.360 --> 01:02:58.527
What have you got?

01:02:58.736 --> 01:03:01.698
It appears to be an aggregate structure
comprised of hundreds of vessels.

01:03:02.157 --> 01:03:05.910
They're held in place by an
interlocking system of magnetic seals.

01:03:06.287 --> 01:03:08.497
There. Right there.

01:03:11.959 --> 01:03:14.130
These bio-readings are not Suliban.

01:03:14.380 --> 01:03:15.881
We can't be certain they're Klingon.

01:03:16.131 --> 01:03:17.842
Even if it is Klaang,
we'd have a tough time

01:03:18.050 --> 01:03:19.635
getting him out of there.

01:03:20.303 --> 01:03:22.972
We could always try
the transporting device.

01:03:23.180 --> 01:03:26.559
We've risked too much
to bring him back inside-out.

01:03:26.767 --> 01:03:28.937
Would the grappler work
in a liquid atmosphere?

01:03:29.980 --> 01:03:31.189
I believe so.

01:03:31.732 --> 01:03:33.358
Bring it online.

01:03:33.567 --> 01:03:36.153
One more time, Mr Mayweather.

01:03:50.335 --> 01:03:51.461
Ventral plating's down.

01:03:51.879 --> 01:03:54.339
- Hold your position.
- Lead ship's closing.

01:03:55.133 --> 01:03:57.176
Seven thousand metres.

01:03:58.261 --> 01:04:00.264
Six thousand.

01:04:01.140 --> 01:04:05.019
- We should ascend.
- Hold your position.

01:04:05.227 --> 01:04:07.522
One thousand metres.

01:04:09.274 --> 01:04:10.859
Forward plating's off-line.

01:04:14.738 --> 01:04:16.615
Now, Mr Reed.

01:04:31.798 --> 01:04:33.174
Their ship's in the launch bay.

01:04:35.552 --> 01:04:37.221
Ask me another one.

01:04:37.430 --> 01:04:39.931
All right. What's this?

01:04:40.140 --> 01:04:42.269
- The pitch control.
- No.

01:04:42.477 --> 01:04:46.106
That's the pitch control.
This is the guidance system.

01:04:46.314 --> 01:04:49.152
Pitch control, guidance system.

01:04:49.360 --> 01:04:50.736
Got it.

01:04:51.320 --> 01:04:53.739
The docking interface.
How do you deploy it?

01:04:53.948 --> 01:04:56.325
Release the inertial clamps here,
here and here,

01:04:56.534 --> 01:04:59.037
then initialise the coaxial ports.

01:04:59.288 --> 01:05:01.330
Good. Where's the auxiliary throttle?

01:05:04.961 --> 01:05:06.962
It's not this one.

01:05:08.715 --> 01:05:10.508
With all due respect
to Commander Tucker,

01:05:10.717 --> 01:05:12.343
I'm pretty sure
I can fly this thing, sir.

01:05:12.552 --> 01:05:14.304
I don't doubt that,
but I need you here.

01:05:14.512 --> 01:05:16.974
There. That's it. Auxiliary throttle.

01:05:22.855 --> 01:05:25.859
Captain, that charge contained
a proximity sweep.

01:05:26.068 --> 01:05:28.236
If we remain here,
they're going to locate us.

01:05:28.486 --> 01:05:30.281
You're gonna have to speed this up
a little.

01:05:30.489 --> 01:05:33.742
How complicated can it be?
Up, down, forward, reverse.

01:05:34.618 --> 01:05:35.911
We'll figure it out.

01:05:40.208 --> 01:05:41.501
We'll be back before you know it.

01:05:41.710 --> 01:05:44.879
Have Mayweather plot a course
for Kronos.

01:05:47.967 --> 01:05:50.051
There's a Vulcan ship
less than two days away.

01:05:50.260 --> 01:05:52.096
It's illogical to attempt this alone.

01:05:52.471 --> 01:05:53.974
I was beginning to think
you understood...

01:05:54.182 --> 01:05:55.307
why we have to do this alone.

01:05:55.516 --> 01:05:58.478
You'll have other opportunities
to demonstrate your independence.

01:05:58.770 --> 01:06:01.481
- "Never put off till tomorrow..."
- You both could be killed.

01:06:01.773 --> 01:06:03.233
Am I sensing concern?

01:06:03.442 --> 01:06:05.861
Last time I checked,
that was considered an emotion.

01:06:06.111 --> 01:06:08.531
If anything happens to either of you,
the Vulcan High Command...

01:06:08.781 --> 01:06:10.159
will hold me responsible.

01:06:10.409 --> 01:06:12.077
Come in.

01:06:12.786 --> 01:06:15.456
- You finished?
- Sir.

01:06:18.041 --> 01:06:21.296
This should reverse the polarity
of any maglock within 100 metres.

01:06:21.587 --> 01:06:24.007
Once you've set the sequence,
you'll have five seconds.

01:06:24.257 --> 01:06:26.427
One more thing.

01:06:28.594 --> 01:06:30.139
Our new weapons.

01:06:30.347 --> 01:06:31.890
They're called phase-pistols.

01:06:32.098 --> 01:06:34.768
They have two settings: Stun and kill.

01:06:35.060 --> 01:06:36.604
It would be best
not to confuse them.

01:06:39.482 --> 01:06:41.025
Time to go.

01:06:43.611 --> 01:06:45.405
The ship is yours.

01:06:56.376 --> 01:06:57.628
What's that?

01:06:57.878 --> 01:07:00.423
Travis said not to worry
about that panel.

01:07:00.631 --> 01:07:02.341
That's reassuring.

01:07:06.679 --> 01:07:08.390
Hold on.

01:07:09.473 --> 01:07:10.851
That was a lot closer.

01:07:11.059 --> 01:07:13.520
If we change our position,
they'll have to start from scratch.

01:07:13.729 --> 01:07:18.025
If we change our position, the captain
will have no way of finding us.

01:07:20.569 --> 01:07:22.071
I think we're there.

01:07:22.280 --> 01:07:24.657
Bring the docking interface online.

01:07:32.791 --> 01:07:35.336
The coaxial ports.

01:07:38.381 --> 01:07:40.926
- Open.
- Let's go.

01:07:45.222 --> 01:07:48.475
Where is it? It was right there.

01:07:48.892 --> 01:07:52.063
Bank starboard 90 degrees.

01:07:55.942 --> 01:07:58.611
There you are.

01:07:59.696 --> 01:08:01.907
That's the upper support radius.

01:08:02.116 --> 01:08:04.118
Drop down right below it.

01:08:04.326 --> 01:08:06.830
Start a counterclockwise sweep.

01:08:14.671 --> 01:08:16.131
A little more.

01:08:18.466 --> 01:08:19.759
A little more.

01:08:29.147 --> 01:08:30.981
Right there.

01:09:13.153 --> 01:09:15.531
Stun seems to work.

01:09:18.283 --> 01:09:19.993
Grab on to something.

01:09:29.296 --> 01:09:31.631
This is ridiculous.
If we don't move the ship,

01:09:31.841 --> 01:09:34.801
Captain Archer won't have anything
to look for when he gets back.

01:09:35.011 --> 01:09:38.305
We're going to need that ear of yours.
Move us away five kilometres.

01:09:38.557 --> 01:09:41.100
- In what direction?
- Any direction.

01:09:47.524 --> 01:09:50.027
This is gonna be easier
than I thought.

01:09:50.236 --> 01:09:53.866
It's okay. We're getting you
off this thing.

01:09:59.455 --> 01:10:01.790
I really don't wanna have to carry you
out of here.

01:10:05.670 --> 01:10:07.880
You okay?

01:10:10.925 --> 01:10:13.095
I think he gets the idea.
Give him a hand.

01:10:30.489 --> 01:10:32.241
Be quiet.

01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:41.919
You tell him, big guy.

01:10:43.253 --> 01:10:44.964
Give me the box.

01:10:55.767 --> 01:10:57.436
Thanks.

01:11:03.985 --> 01:11:06.946
Get to the ship.
I'll be right behind you.

01:11:44.822 --> 01:11:47.491
- Captain?
- It worked, Trip.

01:11:47.700 --> 01:11:49.952
- Where are you?
- Still in the central core.

01:11:50.202 --> 01:11:52.663
- Get Klaang back to Enterprise.
- What about you, sir?

01:11:52.913 --> 01:11:54.916
Get him to the ship.
You can come back for me.

01:11:55.166 --> 01:11:57.002
It's gonna be hard to isolate
your bio-signs,

01:11:57.252 --> 01:11:59.254
so stay as far away from the Suliban
as you can.

01:11:59.504 --> 01:12:01.340
Believe me, I'll try.

01:12:17.859 --> 01:12:21.904
I don't particularly like
the way you smell either.

01:12:22.114 --> 01:12:25.032
I don't get it. This is right where
they're supposed to be.

01:12:26.243 --> 01:12:27.786
The charges are getting
closer again.

01:12:27.995 --> 01:12:30.122
Another five kilometres, ensign.

01:12:30.330 --> 01:12:32.542
At this rate, the captain
will never find us.

01:12:32.834 --> 01:12:34.460
Wait a minute,
I think I've got something.

01:12:34.669 --> 01:12:36.629
Amplify it.

01:12:44.888 --> 01:12:47.016
It's Commander Tucker.

01:12:47.267 --> 01:12:48.685
All I hear is noise.

01:12:51.396 --> 01:12:54.900
It's just a narrow notch
in the midrange.

01:12:57.361 --> 01:13:00.782
He says he's about to ignite
his thruster exhaust.

01:13:05.412 --> 01:13:09.833
- Coordinates: 158, mark 13.
- Laid in.

01:13:10.041 --> 01:13:11.711
Ahead, 50 kph.

01:13:20.302 --> 01:13:21.930
You're welcome.

01:13:22.180 --> 01:13:25.976
- Two kilometres dead ahead.
- Initiate docking procedures.

01:13:26.184 --> 01:13:28.937
I'm only picking up two bio-signs.

01:13:29.146 --> 01:13:31.858
One Klingon, one human.

01:15:01.541 --> 01:15:03.502
Turn this ship around now.

01:15:03.752 --> 01:15:07.131
Our mission is to return the Klingon
to his homeworld.

01:15:07.339 --> 01:15:10.092
Another rescue attempt
could jeopardise that mission.

01:15:10.342 --> 01:15:13.262
The captain specifically told us
to come back for him.

01:15:13.513 --> 01:15:16.640
As commanding officer, it's my job
to interpret the captain's orders.

01:15:16.891 --> 01:15:19.352
I just told you his orders.
What's there to interpret?

01:15:19.602 --> 01:15:22.638
Captain Archer may very well
have told you to return for him later...

01:15:22.772 --> 01:15:24.400
because he knew how stubborn
you can be.

01:15:24.650 --> 01:15:26.109
What the hell's that supposed
to mean?

01:15:26.359 --> 01:15:27.736
You might have risked Klaang's life

01:15:27.945 --> 01:15:30.364
in a foolish attempt to swing back
and rescue the captain.

01:15:30.614 --> 01:15:32.116
I can't believe this.

01:15:34.536 --> 01:15:36.621
The situation must be
analysed logically.

01:15:36.829 --> 01:15:39.165
I don't remember the captain
analysing anything

01:15:39.374 --> 01:15:41.877
when he went back for you
on that roof.

01:15:42.085 --> 01:15:45.215
That is a specious analogy.

01:15:45.424 --> 01:15:46.967
Is it?

01:15:59.188 --> 01:16:00.565
You're wasting your time.

01:16:01.023 --> 01:16:02.860
Klaang knows nothing.

01:16:05.486 --> 01:16:09.491
It would be unwise to discharge
that weapon in this room.

01:16:09.700 --> 01:16:11.827
What is this room?

01:16:12.035 --> 01:16:13.454
What goes on here?

01:16:13.663 --> 01:16:18.626
You've very curious, Jon.
May I call you "Jon"?

01:16:18.835 --> 01:16:22.130
Am I supposed to be impressed
that you know my name?

01:16:22.338 --> 01:16:26.928
I've learned a great deal about you.
Even more than you know.

01:16:27.387 --> 01:16:30.473
Well, I guess you have me
at a disadvantage.

01:16:31.391 --> 01:16:36.312
So why don't you drop
this invisible man routine...

01:16:37.231 --> 01:16:39.525
...and let me see who I'm talking to.

01:16:39.775 --> 01:16:41.485
Hull plating's been repolarised.

01:16:41.694 --> 01:16:43.654
Stand by, impulse engines.

01:16:43.862 --> 01:16:45.991
Mr Tucker, status?

01:16:46.240 --> 01:16:48.576
The auto-sequencer's online,
but annular confinement's...

01:16:48.785 --> 01:16:50.078
still off by two microns.

01:16:50.287 --> 01:16:52.956
- That should sufice.
- Easy for you to say.

01:16:53.206 --> 01:16:55.167
If the Suliban have reestablished
their defences,

01:16:55.376 --> 01:16:56.960
we'll have no other option.

01:16:57.669 --> 01:16:59.338
You wouldn't have come looking
for Klaang...

01:16:59.547 --> 01:17:01.717
if Sarin had told you what she knew.

01:17:01.925 --> 01:17:04.176
That means you're
no threat to me, Jon.

01:17:04.385 --> 01:17:06.471
But I do need you
to leave this room.

01:17:07.097 --> 01:17:08.556
Now.

01:17:13.563 --> 01:17:17.985
This chameleon thing is pretty fancy.

01:17:19.861 --> 01:17:24.199
Was it payment for pitting the Klingons
against each other?

01:17:24.950 --> 01:17:29.288
Or a trophy from
your Temporal Cold War?

01:17:38.424 --> 01:17:41.927
- I was going to let you go.
- Really?

01:17:42.219 --> 01:17:43.387
Then you obviously don't know

01:17:43.637 --> 01:17:45.597
as much about me
as you thought you did.

01:17:45.889 --> 01:17:47.433
On the contrary.

01:17:47.642 --> 01:17:50.103
I could have told you what day
you were going to die,

01:17:50.352 --> 01:17:53.189
but I suppose
that's about to change.

01:18:11.752 --> 01:18:13.129
What's the matter?

01:18:13.379 --> 01:18:15.924
No genetic tricks to keep you
from getting knocked on your butt?

01:18:16.133 --> 01:18:19.386
What you call tricks,
we call progress.

01:18:19.678 --> 01:18:24.141
Are you aware that your genome
is almost identical to that of an ape?

01:18:24.391 --> 01:18:30.022
The Suliban don't share humanity's
patience with natural selection.

01:18:30.231 --> 01:18:32.942
So to speed things up a little...

01:18:33.359 --> 01:18:35.736
...you struck a deal with the devil.

01:19:03.226 --> 01:19:05.019
We have four more
coming up off starboard.

01:19:05.270 --> 01:19:07.397
Can we dock, ensign?

01:19:08.190 --> 01:19:09.984
These aren't ideal conditions.

01:19:11.443 --> 01:19:14.781
Mr Tucker, we're going to plan B.

01:19:36.430 --> 01:19:37.430
Now!

01:19:44.772 --> 01:19:47.067
Bridge, we've got him.

01:19:48.568 --> 01:19:50.612
Sorry, captain.
We had no other choice.

01:20:51.264 --> 01:20:53.391
Something about
disgracing the empire.

01:20:53.599 --> 01:20:56.562
He says he's ready to die.

01:22:12.852 --> 01:22:15.856
I'll take that as a thank-you.

01:22:16.065 --> 01:22:19.611
I don't think they have a word
for "thank you."

01:22:20.196 --> 01:22:21.739
What did he say?

01:22:21.948 --> 01:22:23.700
You don't wanna know.

01:22:30.457 --> 01:22:31.583
Come in.

01:22:34.253 --> 01:22:38.383
I've just gotten a response to the
message I sent to Admiral Forrest.

01:22:39.424 --> 01:22:42.345
He enjoyed telling
the Vulcan High Command

01:22:42.554 --> 01:22:44.514
about the Suliban we ran into.

01:22:44.973 --> 01:22:48.602
It isn't every day he gets to be
the one dispensing information.

01:22:49.811 --> 01:22:51.855
I wanted you both
to hear Starfleet's orders

01:22:52.064 --> 01:22:54.525
before I inform the crew.

01:22:54.732 --> 01:22:55.859
Orders?

01:22:56.068 --> 01:22:58.947
Your people are sending a transport
to pick you up.

01:22:59.322 --> 01:23:01.031
I was under the impression
that Enterprise...

01:23:01.240 --> 01:23:03.536
would be taking me back to Earth.

01:23:03.744 --> 01:23:06.539
It would be a little out of our way.

01:23:06.747 --> 01:23:10.668
Admiral Forrest sees no reason
why we shouldn't keep going.

01:23:11.335 --> 01:23:13.213
Son of a bitch.

01:23:13.463 --> 01:23:17.134
I have a feeling Dr Phlox won't mind
staying around for a while.

01:23:17.384 --> 01:23:20.596
He's developing a fondness
for the human endocrine system.

01:23:20.888 --> 01:23:22.764
I'll get double shifts
on the repair work.

01:23:23.015 --> 01:23:25.768
I think that outer hull's gonna need
a little patching up.

01:23:26.311 --> 01:23:29.230
Let's hope that's the last time
somebody takes a shot at us.

01:23:29.480 --> 01:23:31.275
Let's hope.

01:23:31.483 --> 01:23:34.903
T'Pol. Would you stick around
for a minute?

01:23:37.823 --> 01:23:40.910
Ever since I can remember,
I've seen...

01:23:41.661 --> 01:23:43.871
...Vulcans as an obstacle.

01:23:44.080 --> 01:23:47.585
Always keeping us from standing
on our own two feet.

01:23:47.836 --> 01:23:51.714
- I understand.
- No, I don't think you do.

01:23:53.465 --> 01:23:55.093
If I'm gonna pull this off,

01:23:55.343 --> 01:23:58.347
there are a few things
I need to leave behind.

01:23:58.597 --> 01:24:00.473
Things like...

01:24:01.099 --> 01:24:03.977
...preconceptions, holding grudges.

01:24:07.022 --> 01:24:09.067
This mission would have failed
without your help.

01:24:09.900 --> 01:24:11.443
I won't dispute that.

01:24:14.572 --> 01:24:16.282
I was thinking...

01:24:16.741 --> 01:24:20.662
...a Vulcan science officer
could come in handy.

01:24:20.870 --> 01:24:22.331
But if I asked you to stay,

01:24:22.540 --> 01:24:25.708
it might look like I wasn't ready
to do this on my own.

01:24:26.085 --> 01:24:28.629
Perhaps you should add pride
to your list.

01:24:29.088 --> 01:24:31.257
Perhaps I should.

01:24:32.927 --> 01:24:36.556
It might be best if I were to contact
my superiors...

01:24:36.764 --> 01:24:39.392
and make the request myself.

01:24:39.600 --> 01:24:40.852
With your permission.

01:24:42.895 --> 01:24:44.690
Permission granted.

01:24:56.494 --> 01:25:00.498
I hope nobody is in a big hurry
to get home.

01:25:01.583 --> 01:25:04.837
Starfleet seems to think
that we're ready to begin our mission.

01:25:07.631 --> 01:25:11.970
I understand there's an inhabited
planet a few light-years from here.

01:25:12.178 --> 01:25:13.804
I've detected it, sir.

01:25:14.054 --> 01:25:16.267
Sensors show a nitrogen-sulphide
atmosphere.

01:25:16.517 --> 01:25:18.395
Probably not humanoids.

01:25:18.645 --> 01:25:20.145
That's what we're here to find out.

01:25:20.562 --> 01:25:24.316
Prepare to break orbit
and lay in a course.

01:25:25.610 --> 01:25:28.948
I'm reading an ion storm
on that trajectory, sir.

01:25:29.156 --> 01:25:31.574
Should I go around it?
