WEBVTT

00:00.042 --> 00:02.459
Previously on "Once Upon A Time"...

00:03.175 --> 00:04.584
Papa!

00:09.458 --> 00:11.458
Tilly, put the scalpel down.

00:11.518 --> 00:13.418
I told you something
bad would happen today!

00:13.459 --> 00:14.709
And neither of you listened.

00:14.721 --> 00:16.432
And now you're both too late.

00:21.334 --> 00:23.626
Good evening, Trees.

00:24.827 --> 00:27.662
And you, Stars!

00:27.990 --> 00:31.084
My, you're rather chatty
tonight, aren't you?

00:32.216 --> 00:35.069
Do you know what the stars
say today is, Mr. Hatter?

00:35.394 --> 00:39.484
Well, the Second Star to the
Right is blinking to the north.

00:39.509 --> 00:41.609
Which can only mean one thing...

00:43.813 --> 00:45.613
Today is my birthday!

00:50.480 --> 00:53.647
A very happy birthday to you!

00:56.607 --> 00:58.607
Who wants some cake?

01:20.950 --> 01:22.833
Well...

01:22.834 --> 01:24.668
maybe next year.

01:56.578 --> 01:57.995
Who are you?

02:27.855 --> 02:31.314
Oh, friend... I'm in quite a jam.

02:31.355 --> 02:32.939
They think I killed that poor woman...

02:32.989 --> 02:34.722
But I didn't.

02:34.757 --> 02:36.557
I couldn't.

02:36.592 --> 02:39.093
You know I don't have
that kind of malice in me.

02:48.571 --> 02:49.603
Tilly! Get in the car.

02:49.639 --> 02:50.838
No... nuh-unh.

02:50.873 --> 02:52.706
You didn't believe me before.
And now someone is dead.

02:52.742 --> 02:54.442
I know. I should have
listened to you and I'm sorry.

02:54.480 --> 02:55.605
But I believe you now.

02:55.667 --> 02:58.501
I didn't kill anyone...
really, I didn't. I swear.

02:58.514 --> 03:00.548
Tilly, you can trust me.
I just want to help you.

03:00.583 --> 03:02.550
Just please, get in the bloody car.

03:32.115 --> 03:34.014
You look happy, Papa.

03:38.521 --> 03:41.480
Don't move, spy.

03:54.772 --> 03:55.897
Aah!

03:58.841 --> 04:00.141
Wha...

04:03.045 --> 04:04.912
Who are you? Who sent you?

04:04.947 --> 04:06.614
Nobody sent me. I just...

04:06.897 --> 04:08.439
I wanted to see my Papa.

04:08.467 --> 04:09.633
Then why are you lurking?

04:09.661 --> 04:12.744
Because... his heart is poisoned.

04:12.771 --> 04:14.771
If I got any closer... he'd die.

04:14.807 --> 04:16.640
You're Alice.

04:16.688 --> 04:18.272
Nook's kid.

04:18.277 --> 04:19.576
Nook?

04:19.855 --> 04:22.189
"N-New Hook"... it's a
thing that my mom and...

04:22.247 --> 04:23.479
ya know what? Doesn't matter.

04:23.515 --> 04:26.049
Wow. So you're The Girl in the Tower.

04:26.438 --> 04:27.563
I got out of that tower years ago.

04:27.566 --> 04:28.598
So I heard.

04:28.633 --> 04:30.333
I thought Henry and Ella
left you in Wonderland

04:30.369 --> 04:31.735
looking for a cure for your father.

04:31.770 --> 04:36.206
Well, they did. But... I failed.

04:36.897 --> 04:38.812
I'm sorry.

04:38.813 --> 04:40.272
I know he misses you.

04:40.688 --> 04:42.397
How do you know my papa?

04:42.441 --> 04:43.774
I'm a part of the team.

04:43.813 --> 04:46.147
You know, my mom and aunt, your dad...

04:46.178 --> 04:48.345
a bunch of other people
I don't really know.

04:48.381 --> 04:51.315
Kind of new here. Name's Robin.

04:51.507 --> 04:52.540
"New Robin."

04:52.565 --> 04:53.697
So... Nobin.

04:53.702 --> 04:55.244
- Yeah, don't call me that.
- But if Papa's "Nook,"

04:55.313 --> 04:56.563
it only follows that you
should be "Nobin," right?

04:56.622 --> 04:58.217
It's just different.

04:58.230 --> 05:00.981
- How?
- It's just not cool, okay?

05:01.057 --> 05:02.423
Cool?

05:02.459 --> 05:04.125
Why would you want to be "cool"?

05:04.160 --> 05:06.127
You haven't gotten out much
since the tower, have you?

05:06.162 --> 05:07.595
I've been loads of places.

05:07.630 --> 05:08.629
And this cage?

05:08.665 --> 05:10.498
My least favorite in all the realms.

05:10.813 --> 05:13.314
So mind letting me out of here...

05:13.333 --> 05:14.566
Nobin?

05:14.601 --> 05:16.547
Only if you stop calling me that.

05:30.855 --> 05:32.272
Thank you.

05:32.460 --> 05:33.459
Nobin.

05:36.605 --> 05:39.189
That's him... that's the monster.

05:39.209 --> 05:40.543
I've been tracking him for days.

05:40.579 --> 05:41.678
Wait, wait, wait.

05:41.901 --> 05:43.935
I know that sound.

05:44.196 --> 05:45.982
That's no monster.

05:47.119 --> 05:48.251
That's a friend.

05:48.313 --> 05:50.980
Yeah, well, your friend's
been tormenting villages.

05:50.993 --> 05:53.193
And I have an arrow with his name on it.

05:53.218 --> 05:54.584
See ya around, Tower Girl.

05:54.609 --> 05:56.976
Wait! No, you cannot shoot him!

05:57.088 --> 05:58.488
Stop!

06:01.646 --> 06:03.230
What are those?

06:03.282 --> 06:05.407
Come on, really?

06:05.438 --> 06:07.563
You can't have an operation
without walkie-talkies.

06:07.612 --> 06:09.144
Where's your investigative spirit?

06:10.147 --> 06:11.680
- Ooh. Ooh, ooh.
- Ugh.

06:11.716 --> 06:13.516
Gosh.

06:17.656 --> 06:19.574
_

06:21.063 --> 06:23.981
Okay, smarty, we'll do it your way.

06:24.010 --> 06:26.111
So... where do we start?

06:26.146 --> 06:30.438
Okay, first, we need to
find out everything we can

06:30.480 --> 06:32.480
about my friend Mr. Samdi.

06:32.855 --> 06:35.938
Wait. You're friends with Dr. Facilier?

06:35.956 --> 06:37.490
That's genius.

06:37.515 --> 06:38.740
He's a voodoo doctor...

06:38.765 --> 06:40.462
of course he'll know
a way to cure my dad.

06:40.487 --> 06:41.654
He... he might.

06:41.688 --> 06:43.439
But first, we need to find out

06:43.451 --> 06:45.751
what he's really doing
in Hyperion Heights.

06:45.889 --> 06:46.788
Okay.

06:46.813 --> 06:49.722
This has to stay between us.

06:49.938 --> 06:50.937
Kelly can't know.

06:50.959 --> 06:52.793
Kelly can't know what?

06:53.271 --> 06:54.897
Uh, nothing.

06:54.953 --> 06:58.155
I was just thinking
of adding a kids' menu.

06:58.190 --> 06:59.356
In a bar?

06:59.391 --> 07:00.657
You see, and that attitude

07:00.692 --> 07:03.760
is exactly why I
didn't want to tell you.

07:03.796 --> 07:07.798
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I'm gonna walk Lucy home.

07:07.992 --> 07:09.725
Lock up, will you?

07:09.750 --> 07:11.383
Bye.

07:17.772 --> 07:19.855
- Hot cocoa.
- Mm-hmm.

07:19.882 --> 07:22.883
Ana used to make it for
me when I was feeling blue.

07:25.655 --> 07:27.588
I really messed up.

07:27.972 --> 07:30.719
I just hope there's still
time to fix things with her.

07:30.772 --> 07:32.855
Well, you forgave your mother.

07:32.865 --> 07:34.665
Mother had to die for that to happen.

07:34.688 --> 07:35.980
And I would rather not.

07:36.025 --> 07:38.258
There are other ways to tell
people how you feel about them.

07:38.293 --> 07:40.794
Like, um, I don't know, apologizing?

07:40.813 --> 07:42.314
I take it back, I'd rather die.

07:42.364 --> 07:47.200
I know it's tough... but nothing
beats a genuine "I'm sorry."

07:47.236 --> 07:49.336
Yeah, you're right.

07:49.813 --> 07:51.855
I-I need to go find Ana.

07:51.923 --> 07:52.988
How about I come with you?

07:53.024 --> 07:54.623
I mean, it's not like
I had any other plans.

07:54.667 --> 07:58.376
Henry, you should be with
someone you're meant to be with.

07:58.396 --> 07:59.563
Like Jacinda.

07:59.593 --> 08:02.200
Yeah. Well, I guess the
only thing I'm meant for

08:02.230 --> 08:03.647
is a life of wallowing.

08:03.686 --> 08:05.441
It's cool though, good for the writing.

08:05.466 --> 08:06.754
Okay, stop that.

08:06.789 --> 08:09.323
Cynicism is not your style.

08:09.563 --> 08:11.969
I know that things seem
pretty grim right now,

08:11.980 --> 08:14.272
but they're gonna get better.

08:14.498 --> 08:18.669
And when they do, I hope
you'll be able to forgive me.

08:18.694 --> 08:22.279
Because if I'm going
to start apologizing...

08:22.304 --> 08:25.335
Henry, you're at the top of my list.

08:26.265 --> 08:27.984
And I'm sorry.

08:29.554 --> 08:31.144
I'm sorry for everything.

08:33.042 --> 08:34.042
Wait.

08:34.082 --> 08:35.448
Wait, wait, wait. Ivy, what are you...

08:35.501 --> 08:39.001
What are you talking
about? Why are you sorry?

08:39.558 --> 08:43.490
I just wish I had met
you before I became... me.

08:43.789 --> 08:47.058
Maybe I would have made
better choices and...

08:47.879 --> 08:50.130
things could have been different.

08:50.399 --> 08:52.032
For all of us.

08:59.125 --> 09:00.876
Goodbye, Henry.

09:13.876 --> 09:15.959
Ivy, what was that...

09:16.288 --> 09:17.354
Rogers?

09:17.379 --> 09:18.492
Henry, you here alone?

09:18.527 --> 09:20.227
Yeah, yeah. Why? W-What's going on?

09:20.271 --> 09:21.897
Hey, come here.

09:21.930 --> 09:22.896
Police are after us.

09:22.931 --> 09:24.464
We need a place to hide for a minute.

09:24.500 --> 09:25.732
Wait, wait, wait. You are the police.

09:25.768 --> 09:26.900
No. Not right now, I'm not.

09:26.935 --> 09:28.535
Just let us in and I'll explain.

09:28.570 --> 09:30.737
Yeah. Yeah, of course. Come in.

09:48.189 --> 09:50.189
Seriously? How are you still with me?

09:50.230 --> 09:51.830
I ran track for three years.

09:51.865 --> 09:53.999
I once outran a Bandersnatch.

09:54.034 --> 09:55.576
You're not hurting my friend.

09:55.601 --> 09:57.502
He really is a sweetheart.

09:57.537 --> 09:59.137
The gentlest of giants.

09:59.521 --> 10:02.438
Well... I have to find him first.

10:02.439 --> 10:03.938
I think he's close.

10:03.974 --> 10:06.741
Well, maybe someone
in there has met him.

10:06.776 --> 10:09.110
Then you'll see.

10:23.396 --> 10:25.230
Oh, I think they've met him.

10:27.319 --> 10:29.653
If you've come seeking
shelter, you'll find none here.

10:29.667 --> 10:31.334
A monster destroyed our homes.

10:31.390 --> 10:33.556
He's not a monster... why
does everyone keep saying that?

10:33.592 --> 10:35.859
Because non-monsters
don't flatten villages.

10:36.105 --> 10:37.188
Smart girl.

10:37.223 --> 10:38.756
I see you have a weapon.

10:38.791 --> 10:40.625
You can stay here and protect
the women and children.

10:40.660 --> 10:41.659
Like hell, I will.

10:41.694 --> 10:42.860
I'm going after him, same as you...

10:42.879 --> 10:44.129
- All right, everyone stop.
- Alice, be quiet.

10:44.164 --> 10:47.400
Okay, that troll... that one
you keep calling a monster...

10:47.438 --> 10:49.064
He's the only reason I'm free.

10:49.089 --> 10:51.631
He's my friend.

10:51.655 --> 10:54.489
And he'd never hurt
anyone... unlike you.

10:57.480 --> 10:59.272
You're a crazy girl.

10:59.311 --> 11:01.478
How 'bout we put you
back where you belong?

11:01.513 --> 11:02.879
Lock her up.

11:02.915 --> 11:04.548
Wha...

11:04.595 --> 11:06.288
- And her friend too.
- Whoa, whoa.

11:06.303 --> 11:08.054
Friend's a strong word...
I just met the girl.

11:13.396 --> 11:14.771
It just doesn't add up.

11:14.834 --> 11:15.834
Tilly wanted for murder?

11:15.865 --> 11:17.431
I mean, come on, she
couldn't hurt a fly.

11:17.467 --> 11:19.166
Except for that time she shot Weaver.

11:19.200 --> 11:21.367
- Wait... what?
- That's why I need an alibi.

11:21.404 --> 11:23.537
Somebody who can place
her somewhere else

11:23.574 --> 11:24.766
at the time of the murders...

11:24.783 --> 11:26.772
I don't know, like a... like a friend.

11:26.813 --> 11:28.731
A friend?

11:28.732 --> 11:30.699
No. Don't really have too many of those.

11:30.734 --> 11:33.535
Hey, you're awake.

11:33.813 --> 11:35.063
How you feeling?

11:35.106 --> 11:37.139
Splendid, thank you.

11:37.167 --> 11:39.709
Your couch is marvelously comfy.

11:39.744 --> 11:41.810
Tilly, I need your help.

11:41.846 --> 11:45.347
The M.E. places the time
of death at 3:20 p.m.

11:45.383 --> 11:48.017
Now, Weaver and I only found
you in the hospital after 4:00.

11:48.052 --> 11:50.921
If you were somewhere else,
somebody might have seen you.

11:50.938 --> 11:52.647
Well, why didn't you say that?

11:52.681 --> 11:56.116
I might be short on friends, but
I see loads of people all day.

11:56.151 --> 11:58.251
Great. Well, where were you
yesterday between 3:00 and 4:00?

11:58.287 --> 12:00.587
Now that's a bit more of a puzzle.

12:00.646 --> 12:02.355
I don't really remember exactly.

12:02.358 --> 12:04.057
You don't remember yesterday at all?

12:04.097 --> 12:07.514
Well, once I saw that awful
Eloise Gardner, my mind just...

12:07.529 --> 12:08.895
Well, something happened.

12:08.931 --> 12:12.080
It's like my mind is two
jigsaw puzzles in one box.

12:12.105 --> 12:13.564
Okay. Well... look, it's a challenge,

12:13.605 --> 12:15.356
but one we can work with.

12:15.396 --> 12:18.030
Maybe we can track your moves.

12:18.065 --> 12:19.731
Like a chess match?

12:19.767 --> 12:22.668
Well, more like a, uh, scavenger hunt.

12:27.438 --> 12:28.480
Powdered sugar.

12:28.541 --> 12:30.477
Did you... did you happen to swing by

12:30.502 --> 12:32.969
the Rollin' Bayou
yesterday for beignets?

12:33.266 --> 12:34.508
I did!

12:34.533 --> 12:36.466
Brilliant, Detective!

12:36.499 --> 12:37.665
- Shall we?
- No, no, no.

12:37.690 --> 12:39.089
We shall, but you won't.

12:39.114 --> 12:40.647
Stay put.

12:41.117 --> 12:42.850
We'll be back in an hour.

12:49.230 --> 12:52.148
Well this isn't a very
fun scavenger hunt, is it?

12:59.125 --> 13:00.667
Regina.

13:00.670 --> 13:03.037
I didn't expect to see
you back here so soon.

13:03.740 --> 13:06.307
Please. Come in.

13:06.521 --> 13:11.439
Actually, I'm in the mood
for something different today.

13:11.460 --> 13:12.893
How 'bout lunch?

13:12.928 --> 13:16.029
Maybe a stroll down the waterfront?

13:16.230 --> 13:17.939
Are you free?

13:17.973 --> 13:19.997
- No.
- Hm.

13:20.022 --> 13:24.530
But for you, I'm willing
to cancel everything.

14:04.707 --> 14:06.873
Right.

14:08.983 --> 14:12.151
Let's see what treasures you
have buried here, Henry Mills.

14:15.938 --> 14:17.772
Boring.

14:17.825 --> 14:19.358
Hello?

14:26.396 --> 14:29.730
Maybe you can keep me
company while we wait...

14:44.022 --> 14:45.981
Hm.

14:46.000 --> 14:47.542
Of course!

14:47.590 --> 14:49.007
I know where I was now.

14:58.022 --> 15:00.773
Mrs. Lewis! I'm glad to find you here.

15:00.800 --> 15:02.134
Um, I'm in a bit of a pickle

15:02.187 --> 15:04.120
and I think you've got
a piece of the puzzle.

15:04.354 --> 15:07.521
See, I was here yesterday.
And I need you to say I was.

15:07.551 --> 15:08.708
See?

15:09.938 --> 15:11.188
Who are you?

15:21.271 --> 15:24.354
Hello, Mr. Charles.

15:24.376 --> 15:25.788
Mr. Charles?

15:25.813 --> 15:28.214
Ah, sorry, kid. Didn't see you there.

15:28.347 --> 15:29.720
Kid?

15:29.745 --> 15:31.345
It's me... Tilly.

15:32.685 --> 15:34.284
Tilly?

15:34.320 --> 15:36.520
The girl with the marmalade sandwiches?

15:36.555 --> 15:38.021
I get them from you every day.

15:38.057 --> 15:40.757
Look, lots of people come in here.

15:40.918 --> 15:43.085
I'm sorry... but I don't know you.

15:49.730 --> 15:50.772
I've got to get out of here!

15:50.818 --> 15:52.084
Well, you should've thought about that

15:52.101 --> 15:53.435
before you went all hippie Troll-hugger

15:53.487 --> 15:54.620
on that Frankenstein mob.

15:54.655 --> 15:56.321
I had to try and stop them.

15:56.357 --> 15:57.623
He didn't mean it.

15:57.658 --> 16:00.692
The troll's just scared, and
confused... and he's all alone.

16:02.637 --> 16:04.560
It must be hard for you...

16:04.980 --> 16:06.939
Being locked up again.

16:06.994 --> 16:10.695
The day I got out of that tower
was a bloody dream come true...

16:12.396 --> 16:14.105
At least at first.

16:15.022 --> 16:17.898
Why? What happened?

16:19.105 --> 16:22.480
I thought I'd find a way for me
and Papa to be together again.

16:23.688 --> 16:26.439
'Cause what's the point of
being free if you're all alone?

16:30.167 --> 16:34.001
Back where I'm from...
I was never alone.

16:34.022 --> 16:36.439
That's when I felt the most trapped.

16:36.449 --> 16:39.083
At least you had people.

16:39.105 --> 16:40.564
I talked to a hat.

16:41.888 --> 16:45.890
Seriously, Storybrooke
was insufferably quaint.

16:46.230 --> 16:50.064
Everybody knew your name
and all your business.

16:50.128 --> 16:52.295
And one night I just had enough.

16:52.691 --> 16:54.481
What'd you do?

16:55.838 --> 16:58.472
I hot-wired the Sheriff's Yellow Bug.

16:59.813 --> 17:01.397
I stole it.

17:01.399 --> 17:03.973
I would have hit New York by
morning if she hadn't caught me.

17:03.989 --> 17:06.031
But for eight glorious minutes

17:06.069 --> 17:09.637
it was just me and that
Bug and the wide-open road.

17:09.674 --> 17:11.574
You rode a bug?

17:11.605 --> 17:14.021
No, no, no. A Bug is a type of car.

17:14.286 --> 17:16.353
Here. Let me show you.

17:20.917 --> 17:22.167
See?

17:24.313 --> 17:26.231
What is this thing?

17:26.256 --> 17:27.289
It's magic.

17:28.859 --> 17:31.727
No, it's not magic.
It's called a smartphone.

17:31.762 --> 17:34.029
It held my entire life back home.

17:34.294 --> 17:37.399
A whole life trapped
in this tiny little box?

17:37.897 --> 17:39.398
I thought I was in a prison...

17:41.696 --> 17:43.333
You have a funny way
of looking at the world,

17:43.366 --> 17:44.491
don't you, Tower Girl?

17:50.271 --> 17:53.189
My papa used to say all
the best people are mad.

17:54.919 --> 17:59.956
He'd say... "Starfish, you meet
loads of people in this world.

18:00.181 --> 18:05.140
But the best ones...
they'll challenge you.

18:05.772 --> 18:08.772
Make you see the world through
a whole new looking glass."

18:09.926 --> 18:11.468
You're lucky.

18:13.532 --> 18:15.599
I never knew mine.

18:15.634 --> 18:17.834
He died when I was a baby.

18:19.189 --> 18:23.940
No cute nicknames. No fatherly advice.

18:24.313 --> 18:28.313
All I have is his name
and his legacy to uphold.

18:28.336 --> 18:30.302
Which is why...

18:31.271 --> 18:33.354
I can't stay here.

18:34.300 --> 18:35.666
How'd you do that?!

18:35.701 --> 18:39.570
First lesson of escape and
thievery... sleight of hand.

18:41.855 --> 18:44.105
Amazing! Do me next!

18:50.681 --> 18:52.614
I'm sorry, Tower Girl.

18:52.646 --> 18:54.397
But hitting that Troll is my one shot

18:54.436 --> 18:56.469
at honoring my father's legacy.

18:56.692 --> 18:58.658
And I'm not gonna let you stop me.

19:05.022 --> 19:07.231
You know, I usually go for
the pizza at Bella Notte,

19:07.247 --> 19:10.115
but that chowder was incredible.

19:10.150 --> 19:12.751
- It was made for days like this.
- Mm.

19:14.671 --> 19:16.754
I'm glad we did this, Regina.

19:17.143 --> 19:18.557
There's something I want to tell you.

19:18.813 --> 19:20.938
Aha! I knew it.

19:20.983 --> 19:22.382
You lied to me.

19:22.418 --> 19:24.885
He just called you Regina. He is awake.

19:24.920 --> 19:27.988
And this isn't "business."
This is a date! With him.

19:28.023 --> 19:29.356
Nice to see you again, Kelly.

19:29.391 --> 19:32.459
Oh, shut up with your "Kellys."
You know who I am... Facilier.

19:32.494 --> 19:33.860
Why would you lie to me, Regina?

19:33.896 --> 19:35.495
Because... I'm a full-grown woman

19:35.531 --> 19:37.698
who doesn't have to tell
her sister everything.

19:37.733 --> 19:40.734
Why don't I give the two of you
some space to figure this out?

19:40.769 --> 19:43.103
Oh, no, no, no, no.
She was just leaving.

19:43.138 --> 19:44.204
No, I wasn't.

19:44.230 --> 19:45.856
Call me later, Regina.

19:45.908 --> 19:49.176
Zelena, always a pleasure.

19:52.063 --> 19:53.229
Zelena.

19:53.230 --> 19:55.814
This wasn't a date...
it was a distraction.

19:55.884 --> 19:58.318
Lucy's in his apartment
right now doing recon.

19:58.510 --> 20:01.077
We have to get her out of
there before he gets home.

20:30.189 --> 20:31.481
Tilly.

20:31.505 --> 20:33.346
Tilly, come here, come here.

20:35.943 --> 20:37.743
I told you to stay put.

20:37.778 --> 20:38.977
Somebody could've seen you.

20:39.013 --> 20:41.280
Nope. Nuh-unh. No one sees me.

20:41.438 --> 20:42.855
I'm invisible.

20:42.903 --> 20:44.200
What are you talking about?

20:44.225 --> 20:45.437
I was here yesterday.

20:45.472 --> 20:48.307
I thought someone might
have seen me, but nobody did.

20:48.353 --> 20:51.487
I know everyone in the
Heights... but nobody knows me.

20:51.941 --> 20:53.664
What if...

20:55.563 --> 20:58.397
what if I don't exist at all?

20:58.474 --> 21:00.607
You exist, luv.

21:00.643 --> 21:02.242
Or else I'm the mad
one, talking to no one.

21:02.282 --> 21:03.365
I'm not mad.

21:03.412 --> 21:05.145
If you say you were here, you were here.

21:05.438 --> 21:07.270
Just backtrack your moves.

21:07.271 --> 21:08.938
Like in chess, remember?

21:08.987 --> 21:10.153
- Okay.
- Yeah?

21:10.188 --> 21:11.987
Um...

21:12.012 --> 21:15.035
Well, uh, after I finished the beignets,

21:15.060 --> 21:18.030
I grabbed an apple from the bodega,

21:18.063 --> 21:20.814
tossed the core in the rubbish
bin by the newspaper stand,

21:20.858 --> 21:22.286
uh, grabbed a marmalade sandwich,

21:22.311 --> 21:25.549
and then I-I ducked into
this alleyway to eat it.

21:25.574 --> 21:27.192
Unless you ran into Oscar the Grouch,

21:27.230 --> 21:29.106
you're not gonna find
an alibi back here.

21:29.118 --> 21:31.118
My backpack.

21:31.351 --> 21:32.784
I thought I lost this.

21:32.809 --> 21:34.446
Now I know I can at least trust myself.

21:34.471 --> 21:35.613
It proves I was here.

21:35.638 --> 21:37.097
And, well, maybe
there's something in here

21:37.122 --> 21:38.543
that proves I didn't kill that woman.

21:38.568 --> 21:41.152
Maybe... be we can't...
we can't do it here.

21:41.194 --> 21:42.653
You're too exposed. Come on.

21:42.705 --> 21:43.937
Come on.

21:48.354 --> 21:50.188
The Troll is in there.

21:50.220 --> 21:53.621
I say we charge in, torches blazing!

22:00.730 --> 22:02.130
How the hell did you get out?

22:02.167 --> 22:04.751
Basic pin-tumbler lock? Child's play.

22:04.794 --> 22:06.995
So do you want my help,

22:07.022 --> 22:09.231
or do you just want to charge
in there like a bunch of losers?

22:09.269 --> 22:10.352
You're just a little girl

22:10.366 --> 22:11.799
that couldn't even hit
me from 10 feet away.

22:11.834 --> 22:13.445
I wasn't trying to hit you.

22:13.470 --> 22:17.148
And I wouldn't
underestimate "little girls."

22:17.173 --> 22:18.523
I'm Robin Hood.

22:21.480 --> 22:23.730
You're the legendary Robin Hood?

22:23.977 --> 22:26.467
I thought he was a little taller.

22:26.503 --> 22:29.804
He was my father.

22:29.995 --> 22:32.133
It's my mantle now.

22:32.855 --> 22:34.606
And I'll prove it to you.

22:36.444 --> 22:38.745
I'd like to see this.

22:39.051 --> 22:41.914
All right, Girl Robin Hood.

22:42.897 --> 22:44.606
You've got one shot.

23:10.170 --> 23:11.587
Seriously, Tower Girl?

23:11.612 --> 23:13.634
Turns out I have more than one hairpin.

23:13.646 --> 23:16.313
You Troll-loving lunatic.

23:17.063 --> 23:19.605
I warned you to stay out of our way.

23:23.540 --> 23:25.039
This girl's troubled.

23:27.615 --> 23:29.032
And I don't like trouble.

23:30.139 --> 23:32.850
Hey, back off, jerk wad!

23:34.189 --> 23:35.856
We'll find the Troll again, okay?

23:35.884 --> 23:38.860
No. She needs to be taken care of.

23:38.982 --> 23:40.399
Did you not hear me?

23:40.439 --> 23:42.148
I said leave her alone.

23:42.193 --> 23:44.226
I thought you wanted
to join our campaign.

23:44.261 --> 23:45.527
Are you a Troll-Lover now, too?

23:45.563 --> 23:47.363
I would rather be a Troll-Lover

23:47.398 --> 23:50.032
than fight beside a bully like you.

23:57.480 --> 23:59.022
We need to get out of here...

23:59.032 --> 24:00.298
we need an escape.

24:00.333 --> 24:01.399
Escape...

24:16.423 --> 24:18.416
Is that...

24:18.730 --> 24:20.939
The Yellow Bug... but that's impossible.

24:20.971 --> 24:23.648
Sometimes I've believed as
many as six impossible things

24:23.688 --> 24:25.063
before breakfast.

24:25.098 --> 24:26.264
Get in!

24:49.189 --> 24:51.690
C'mon, Lucy... pick up, pick up...

24:53.516 --> 24:55.386
You should have used walkie-talkies.

24:55.605 --> 24:56.647
They squawk.

24:56.673 --> 24:57.772
This is all your fault.

24:57.807 --> 24:59.007
Excuse me?

24:59.042 --> 25:01.576
How is it my fault you
sent your grand-kiddie

25:01.611 --> 25:03.211
into a genuine snake pit?

25:03.246 --> 25:04.679
He is not a snake.

25:04.714 --> 25:05.780
Oh, my God.

25:06.063 --> 25:07.480
You like him.

25:07.840 --> 25:09.242
You know what I'd like...

25:09.278 --> 25:11.077
To get Lucy the hell out of there.

25:15.007 --> 25:16.466
The Death Card.

25:16.728 --> 25:18.528
I got to show Grandma this.

25:24.521 --> 25:26.313
_

25:59.772 --> 26:01.523
Yesterday... yesterday...

26:01.543 --> 26:04.046
It's like I was a
different person yesterday.

26:04.071 --> 26:06.171
Tilly, we need something
with a timestamp on it

26:06.211 --> 26:07.402
to show when and where you were.

26:07.420 --> 26:09.670
Like a, uh... like a receipt, maybe.

26:09.709 --> 26:12.265
Well, that's curious.

26:13.566 --> 26:14.932
What are these?

26:17.684 --> 26:19.134
The, um...

26:20.518 --> 26:21.601
the killer...

26:21.626 --> 26:23.670
took hair clippings
from all of his victims.

26:23.690 --> 26:25.423
Wha...

26:25.605 --> 26:27.189
But if I have them, that means that I...

26:27.214 --> 26:28.914
Let's... Let's just try and stay calm.

26:28.949 --> 26:30.649
Oh! I've gone mad, haven't I?

26:30.684 --> 26:32.050
If I can't remember not doing it...

26:32.085 --> 26:33.251
How do I know I didn't do it?

26:33.287 --> 26:34.319
I-I don't know.

26:34.354 --> 26:35.554
This makes things more complicated,

26:35.563 --> 26:37.105
but we don't... we don't
know the full story.

26:37.157 --> 26:39.357
And I have a feeling in my
gut that you're not a killer.

26:39.393 --> 26:41.927
You just met me, Detective.

26:41.962 --> 26:43.395
You don't know me.

26:45.574 --> 26:47.200
No one knows me.

26:49.234 --> 26:51.368
Tilly. Tilly, wait!

27:04.011 --> 27:06.012
I think we lost the mob.

27:07.349 --> 27:09.667
Why did you help me out back there?

27:11.043 --> 27:12.575
I don't know.

27:12.611 --> 27:15.839
You know, back in Storybrooke,
I was kind of a mean girl.

27:16.082 --> 27:18.349
All I cared about was being popular.

27:18.720 --> 27:22.288
Yeah. I saw. You got loads of friends.

27:23.313 --> 27:25.730
I wouldn't really call them friends.

27:26.022 --> 27:28.439
But their approval was addicting.

27:29.296 --> 27:30.880
I hated it.

27:30.963 --> 27:32.653
So I came here to start over...

27:32.688 --> 27:34.980
and then I started
seeking my father's legacy

27:35.005 --> 27:37.964
for all the same, dumb reasons.

27:39.313 --> 27:43.563
But back there, I think I remembered

27:43.712 --> 27:45.923
what being Robin Hood is really about...

27:46.980 --> 27:48.898
Protecting those who need it.

27:50.897 --> 27:52.564
Thank you.

27:54.842 --> 27:56.709
For being on my side.

28:01.741 --> 28:02.807
That's the Troll.

28:02.842 --> 28:05.343
We need to find him
before the villagers do.

28:06.846 --> 28:08.246
Are you with me?

28:26.563 --> 28:29.522
This is it, isn't it?

28:29.833 --> 28:31.262
Yep.

28:32.230 --> 28:35.647
For the first 6,205 days of my life,

28:37.063 --> 28:39.313
this was Home Sweet Tower.

28:41.354 --> 28:43.230
I hate this place.

28:44.688 --> 28:46.480
I hate its stupid stones...

28:46.486 --> 28:51.231
and its stupid turret and
its dumb... mossy base.

28:51.284 --> 28:53.284
And I hate...

28:55.980 --> 28:59.647
I hate that all I've wanted to
do since I left is come back.

29:01.876 --> 29:04.084
At least when I was
trapped, I could have hope

29:04.095 --> 29:06.512
that when I got free,
everything would be okay.

29:08.438 --> 29:10.022
But then I did.

29:12.609 --> 29:13.527
And it wasn't.

29:13.554 --> 29:14.887
Hey, hey. It's okay...

29:14.918 --> 29:17.335
No, no, it's not okay.

29:17.391 --> 29:20.325
Who in their right mind
wants to be a prisoner?!

29:20.730 --> 29:23.855
I've escaped these walls...
but I'm still bloody trapped.

29:27.403 --> 29:29.603
I'll never be free of it, will I?

29:41.105 --> 29:44.147
Alice... you need to
stop the Troll. Now.

29:44.167 --> 29:45.266
How am I supposed to do that?!

29:45.302 --> 29:47.402
Just say... "Hey! Troll! Stop!"

29:49.351 --> 29:50.438
Yes.

29:50.473 --> 29:52.840
If anybody can do it, you can do it.

29:56.438 --> 29:59.480
Look, you may be mad,
but you have magic.

29:59.526 --> 30:00.792
I can sense it.

30:00.813 --> 30:03.896
Alice... the Troll came home
because you wanted to come home.

30:03.934 --> 30:05.976
And back there... when
we needed an escape?

30:06.017 --> 30:07.643
- The Bug appeared.
- What are you saying?

30:07.667 --> 30:09.555
What if... all those years ago

30:09.580 --> 30:13.030
when you wanted to escape the
Tower... you created the Troll?

30:14.147 --> 30:16.606
I wished for him on my birthday...

30:16.822 --> 30:18.239
or at least, to be free.

30:18.273 --> 30:19.806
Why has he come back?

30:19.980 --> 30:21.606
Because...

30:23.813 --> 30:25.813
because today is my birthday.

30:27.027 --> 30:28.810
And I didn't want to be alone.

30:28.845 --> 30:31.346
You're not alone. I'm here.

30:31.381 --> 30:32.947
Don't you see?

30:32.980 --> 30:36.647
It was you all along.
You saved yourself.

30:51.147 --> 30:52.439
Hello, old friend.

30:53.521 --> 30:57.105
It's me, Alice.

30:58.243 --> 31:00.843
I'm all grown up, aren't I?

31:00.878 --> 31:04.380
And I've been so many places
since we saw each other last.

31:04.415 --> 31:08.818
It's curiouser and madder and sadder...

31:09.147 --> 31:11.481
and so much more wonderful out here

31:11.512 --> 31:13.712
than I ever imagined it could be.

31:17.063 --> 31:18.730
So thank you.

31:20.521 --> 31:22.588
You don't have to
worry about me anymore.

31:25.933 --> 31:27.674
'Cause I'm okay.

31:29.063 --> 31:30.438
I promise.

31:33.655 --> 31:36.878
I think, after all this time...

31:38.713 --> 31:40.355
I'm finally...

31:44.313 --> 31:49.480
Gosh, it's such a big,
beautiful world, isn't it?

31:52.105 --> 31:53.147
Free.

32:35.396 --> 32:37.771
Do you know how the evidence got here?

32:37.819 --> 32:40.220
You know me better than anyone.

32:40.255 --> 32:42.088
I can't have done it, could I?

32:42.124 --> 32:44.724
Or I could've done it, can't I?

32:46.688 --> 32:48.355
I really am all alone.

32:50.165 --> 32:52.299
I have to leave this place.

32:52.354 --> 32:54.230
Before I hurt anyone else.

33:03.772 --> 33:05.814
He didn't see me.

33:05.829 --> 33:07.862
Well, you're kind of hard to miss.

33:09.575 --> 33:12.233
I'm sorry. Were you just
talking to the Troll?

33:12.269 --> 33:13.468
Yeah.

33:13.521 --> 33:14.813
I know what you're thinking...

33:14.824 --> 33:17.783
Crazy Tilly, totally
bonkers, absolutely mad.

33:18.493 --> 33:19.821
Yeah, kinda.

33:20.357 --> 33:22.591
But all the best people are.

33:22.712 --> 33:23.945
I just got back from Tibet.

33:23.980 --> 33:25.563
Everybody there talks to statues.

33:27.984 --> 33:30.101
So... what were you telling the Troll?

33:31.230 --> 33:33.064
I was...

33:34.779 --> 33:36.813
I was saying goodbye.

33:37.022 --> 33:39.105
You're running away.

33:39.137 --> 33:40.636
I tried that.

33:40.671 --> 33:42.538
You know what I found out?

33:42.659 --> 33:46.128
Sometimes you just have to
look up and face your problems.

33:48.438 --> 33:49.813
Well...

33:49.880 --> 33:53.047
it was nice to meet you, Crazy Tilly.

33:53.438 --> 33:55.563
Good luck.

33:55.603 --> 33:57.636
Uh, hey...

33:57.688 --> 33:59.397
What's that you're reading?

34:01.375 --> 34:03.408
"Alice in Wonderland."

34:03.433 --> 34:05.100
It's my favorite.

34:21.429 --> 34:22.561
Tilly.

34:22.597 --> 34:25.231
We're out of time. I
have to take you in.

34:25.266 --> 34:28.143
I will find you an alibi. I promise.

34:29.409 --> 34:31.775
I think I've already found someone.

34:41.313 --> 34:43.563
A security camera?

34:43.606 --> 34:46.190
He saw me.

34:46.937 --> 34:48.726
He's always seen me.

34:52.069 --> 34:54.335
And now it seems he can talk.

35:08.271 --> 35:10.563
Samdi.

35:10.595 --> 35:12.728
I'm so sorry about my sister earlier.

35:12.772 --> 35:14.855
She only has one speed... tornado.

35:14.866 --> 35:17.133
You don't have to apologize for her.

35:17.168 --> 35:20.770
I just came to say I'm
sorry our date got cut short.

35:20.805 --> 35:22.538
And to return this.

35:26.022 --> 35:29.523
Your granddaughter
left it in my apartment.

35:29.563 --> 35:31.196
Fine. You caught me.

35:31.972 --> 35:33.866
I had Lucy break in to your apartment.

35:33.901 --> 35:36.729
But that doesn't change what she found.

35:37.405 --> 35:38.437
These?

35:38.472 --> 35:39.438
Yes.

35:39.646 --> 35:41.605
I saw the Death Card.

35:41.667 --> 35:43.223
Who are you after?

35:43.248 --> 35:47.050
You know, Regina...
you could've just asked.

35:49.147 --> 35:51.397
I'm here for the Dark One Dagger.

35:55.385 --> 36:00.054
Despite our twisted history,
Rumple is my oldest friend.

36:00.089 --> 36:01.882
Do you really think
I'm just gonna stand by

36:01.907 --> 36:02.824
and watch you kill him?

36:02.849 --> 36:04.015
No.

36:04.354 --> 36:06.813
But I want to be cards
up with you, Regina.

36:06.860 --> 36:10.829
You know what kind of
man I am. You always have.

36:10.864 --> 36:12.430
You...

36:12.480 --> 36:15.439
You've always been
more difficult to read.

36:19.469 --> 36:21.462
This is your past.

36:22.644 --> 36:24.110
Your present.

36:26.438 --> 36:28.813
This is your future.

36:30.563 --> 36:33.272
There could be a great
love in your cards.

36:33.285 --> 36:35.731
But only you can choose your path.

36:37.354 --> 36:39.938
And what choice do I have?

36:40.785 --> 36:42.685
Other than to stop you?

36:43.959 --> 36:46.918
Take a page from your
old teacher's book,

36:47.237 --> 36:49.938
find a way to have it all.

37:05.042 --> 37:06.108
This places you at the Troll

37:06.143 --> 37:07.576
at the time of the blind beggar's death.

37:07.611 --> 37:09.211
How did I not see it before?

37:09.246 --> 37:11.346
It was like he was winking right at me.

37:11.563 --> 37:15.397
Well, I checked... and the
city only recently installed it

37:15.438 --> 37:17.521
because of a graffiti problem.

37:17.555 --> 37:19.788
Guess she had a friend after all.

37:20.049 --> 37:21.605
But if I didn't do it,

37:21.646 --> 37:23.938
that means the real killer's
still out there somewhere.

37:23.972 --> 37:25.615
And whoever it is tried to frame you.

37:25.640 --> 37:27.006
Well, that's for me to
worry about, isn't it?

37:27.031 --> 37:29.298
All that matters is that
you're free to go, Tilly.

37:35.772 --> 37:37.314
Detective?

37:38.896 --> 37:40.529
Yeah? What is it?

37:42.466 --> 37:44.033
Nothing.

37:45.596 --> 37:47.462
Just... thank you.

37:59.105 --> 38:00.397
Make a wish...

38:00.430 --> 38:02.306
just not for another Troll.

38:10.521 --> 38:12.272
So... what did you wish for?

38:12.326 --> 38:14.259
You know that's not how works.

38:15.462 --> 38:18.797
But I've got a good
feeling about this one.

38:19.022 --> 38:21.272
Why don't we take this for the road

38:21.313 --> 38:23.189
and get the hell out of this place?

38:34.230 --> 38:38.189
Goodbye, Tower Girl.

38:57.312 --> 38:59.603
I made you an apology.

39:01.507 --> 39:02.940
Go on, then.

39:07.189 --> 39:10.648
I'm sorry I hid Facilier from you.

39:12.584 --> 39:14.217
Look, we may never approve

39:14.230 --> 39:16.731
of each other's
questionable life decisions,

39:17.255 --> 39:20.857
but I promise to be cards
up with you from now on.

39:21.897 --> 39:23.564
I promise.

39:24.785 --> 39:28.202
Facilier wants Rumple's dagger.

39:28.518 --> 39:29.617
What?

39:29.652 --> 39:31.352
Yeah, I know.

39:31.387 --> 39:35.389
And... you were right.

39:37.730 --> 39:40.397
I have feelings for him.

39:40.716 --> 39:43.784
Even after finding that out.

39:49.980 --> 39:52.147
No judgment.

39:58.218 --> 39:59.706
Mom?

40:00.566 --> 40:03.634
Margot... you're back!

40:04.480 --> 40:07.689
Well, I only got your
37 missed messages.

40:08.022 --> 40:09.231
Wow.

40:09.252 --> 40:12.253
I guess there really is
no place like home, huh?

40:12.288 --> 40:13.521
Yeah.

40:13.556 --> 40:15.823
Sorry I've been so out of touch.

40:15.859 --> 40:18.759
It's okay. I'm just so glad you're here.

40:18.795 --> 40:19.927
Come on.

40:19.963 --> 40:21.996
Wow, I haven't seen the
two of you share a drink

40:22.031 --> 40:23.264
in I don't know how long.

40:23.299 --> 40:26.968
Yeah, well, a lot's changed
since you left, Ro...

40:27.003 --> 40:28.402
Margot.

40:28.646 --> 40:30.896
Why don't I wash the
airport out of my hair?

40:30.904 --> 40:33.542
And then we can talk about
this over hot toddies.

40:33.563 --> 40:35.272
Sounds perfect.

40:44.230 --> 40:46.856
I didn't realize how hard it would be.

40:46.914 --> 40:52.117
To look her in the eye and
lie about who we really are.

40:55.354 --> 40:57.688
Welcome to the club, sis.

41:23.313 --> 41:26.563
Detective. What are you doing here?

41:26.603 --> 41:27.602
Oh.

41:27.637 --> 41:29.537
Yeah. You left his.

41:29.573 --> 41:32.107
You really should keep
a closer eye on it.

41:32.147 --> 41:34.898
Yeah. Cheers.

41:34.938 --> 41:38.105
Look, Tilly, this, uh... this
place isn't isn't safe for you.

41:38.134 --> 41:40.885
Not with the... not with
the murderer at large.

41:42.017 --> 41:44.651
I don't got nowhere else to go.

41:46.556 --> 41:48.923
How 'bout you come stay
with me for a while?

41:48.938 --> 41:51.355
I've got a spare room, central heating,

41:51.428 --> 41:53.695
a better lock on the door than this.

41:57.480 --> 41:58.730
Yeah.

42:01.375 --> 42:04.251
I'd like that very much.

42:04.274 --> 42:06.040
All right, then. Good.

42:06.076 --> 42:07.609
Well... come on.

42:07.644 --> 42:09.766
Let's go home.
