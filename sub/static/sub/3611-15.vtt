00:02.003 --> 00:03.664
Previously on Lost:

00:06.424 --> 00:08.255
Hello, Ben.

00:08.759 --> 00:11.341
- You're alive!
- Yes, I am.

00:11.429 --> 00:14.341
Are you saying you know
how to find them? How to find Jin?

00:14.432 --> 00:15.512
I have some ideas.

00:15.600 --> 00:20.435
So you knew this would happen
to Locke if we brought him back here?

00:20.521 --> 00:22.603
Dead is dead.

00:23.733 --> 00:25.724
You don't get to come back from that.

00:27.195 --> 00:29.527
The Dharma folks at the Swan worksite,

00:29.614 --> 00:33.698
they're gonna drill into the ground and
tap into a massive pocket of energy.

00:33.784 --> 00:37.447
That will cause your plane, Oceanic 815,

00:37.580 --> 00:39.286
to crash on this island.

00:39.415 --> 00:42.373
I think I can negate that energy.

00:42.460 --> 00:46.203
lfl can,
then that hatch will never be built,

00:46.297 --> 00:49.881
and your plane will land,
just like it's supposed to.

00:49.967 --> 00:53.050
And just how exactly
do you plan on destroying this energy?

00:53.137 --> 00:55.924
I'm gonna detonate a hydrogen bomb.

01:01.145 --> 01:03.727
Where's the bomb, Richard?
Where is it?

01:03.814 --> 01:06.305
The hydrogen bomb
I told you to bury. Where is it?

01:07.985 --> 01:10.852
Listen to me.
Lower your gun and we'll talk. OK?

01:10.988 --> 01:13.274
Nobody has to get hurt.
Just put the gun down.

01:18.996 --> 01:21.078
I'm gonna give you three seconds.

01:22.625 --> 01:24.490
- One...
- Don't do this.

01:26.671 --> 01:28.411
What is he doing down there?

01:28.506 --> 01:30.872
- He's crazy.
- Is he?

01:32.468 --> 01:34.629
What if this is why we're here?

01:36.305 --> 01:38.682
What if this is our one chance
to put things back

01:38.808 --> 01:40.423
the way they're supposed to be?

01:44.814 --> 01:45.849
No.

01:45.940 --> 01:47.931
- What are you doing?
- They shot him...

01:48.025 --> 01:51.188
They're gonna shoot you, too!
We have to go, Jack! We have to go now.

01:57.743 --> 02:00.075
- Jack...
- Don't you move!

02:02.957 --> 02:04.447
Don't move!

02:16.178 --> 02:18.385
And just who the bloody hell
might you be?

02:40.036 --> 02:41.196
Eloise.

02:42.580 --> 02:43.911
What happened?

02:47.126 --> 02:51.460
This man walked into camp,
put a gun to my head. Eloise... reacted.

02:51.589 --> 02:53.079
Where'd you find them?

02:53.174 --> 02:55.506
Crouched in the bushes. Like rats.

02:55.593 --> 02:57.834
Did you two come here with this man?

03:01.265 --> 03:02.596
Yes.

03:05.436 --> 03:06.767
Put them in my tent.

03:09.774 --> 03:11.765
Would you care to tell me, Eloise,

03:11.859 --> 03:15.397
why the Dharma Initiative
seems to have declared war on us?

03:16.697 --> 03:19.939
These people aren't from
the Dharma Initiative, Charles.

03:24.622 --> 03:26.578
Then where the hell are they from?

03:57.988 --> 04:00.821
Richard. He's here.

04:13.671 --> 04:14.956
I brought dinner.

04:16.090 --> 04:17.330
John?

04:20.594 --> 04:24.428
Hello, Richard. It's been a while.

04:27.685 --> 04:30.347
It's been... three years.

04:32.148 --> 04:34.685
What happened? Where were you?

04:34.775 --> 04:36.311
I'll explain on the way.

04:37.695 --> 04:39.185
On the way where?

04:39.321 --> 04:40.606
It's gonna be night soon.

04:40.698 --> 04:44.316
You and l have an errand to run,
and we don't have a lot of time.

04:48.330 --> 04:49.365
What's wrong?

04:50.875 --> 04:52.706
Something different about you.

04:55.713 --> 04:58.125
l have a purpose now.

05:05.931 --> 05:08.388
What's he doing here?

05:08.517 --> 05:10.223
He helped me get back.

05:16.567 --> 05:20.230
Why did Locke say these were his people?
I thought they were yours.

05:20.362 --> 05:23.729
When I left the island, John stepped in.

05:23.824 --> 05:25.155
He's the leader now.

05:25.242 --> 05:27.233
Who's that man he's talking to?

05:27.328 --> 05:31.367
His name is Richard Alpert.
He's a kind of...

05:33.042 --> 05:36.250
...advisor.

05:36.378 --> 05:41.247
And he has had that job
for a very, very long time.

05:46.597 --> 05:48.508
Sun? What are you...?

05:50.601 --> 05:53.343
Were you here in 1977?

05:54.939 --> 05:56.429
Excuse me?

05:56.524 --> 05:58.355
These people...

05:58.442 --> 06:01.855
Jack Shephard.
Kate Austen. Hugo Reyes.

06:01.946 --> 06:05.109
They were here
with my husband, Jin Kwon.

06:06.283 --> 06:08.945
Were you here?

06:09.078 --> 06:11.239
Do you remember them?
Any of them?

06:13.874 --> 06:16.866
Yes. l was here 30 years ago.

06:16.961 --> 06:20.624
And | rememberthese people.
I remember meeting them very clearly.

06:20.756 --> 06:22.041
Because”.

06:25.261 --> 06:27.547
...I watched them all die.

07:02.881 --> 07:04.257
Drink of water?

07:05.718 --> 07:09.586
Do you think it's true?
They're all dead?

07:09.680 --> 07:12.763
I don't think we went through
all this for nothing, Sun.

07:12.850 --> 07:14.056
I'm ready, John.

07:17.187 --> 07:19.348
You still have that compass I gave you?

07:24.862 --> 07:27.274
Little rusty,
but she can still find north.

07:28.782 --> 07:31.068
Ben, I'd appreciate it if you joined us.

07:31.201 --> 07:35.035
Why, John? Don't you trust me
here with my former people?

07:35.122 --> 07:36.703
Afraid l'll stage a coup?

07:36.790 --> 07:39.532
I'm not afraid of anything
you can do anymore, Ben.

07:42.630 --> 07:45.747
- In that case, I'd love to come.
- Good.

07:47.718 --> 07:50.175
Stay here.
We'll be back in a couple of hours.

07:50.262 --> 07:51.877
I'll see what I can find out.

07:51.972 --> 07:54.213
But whatever happens,
you have my word,

07:54.308 --> 07:57.175
if there's a way
for you and Jin to be together again,

07:57.269 --> 07:59.385
if there's a way to save our people...

08:01.231 --> 08:03.222
I'll find it.

08:14.411 --> 08:15.912
Take it easy on her.

08:18.499 --> 08:21.582
Don't talk. Understand?

08:29.093 --> 08:30.583
Are you OK?

08:33.389 --> 08:34.469
Yeah.

08:40.562 --> 08:42.268
Before we were caught...

08:45.025 --> 08:49.143
...you said we needed to put things back
the way they were supposed to be.

08:53.117 --> 08:54.857
What did you mean by that?

08:56.495 --> 08:58.486
If we can do what Faraday said...

09:00.124 --> 09:02.706
...our plane never crashes.

09:02.793 --> 09:05.205
Flight 815 lands in Los Angeles.

09:05.295 --> 09:09.334
And everyone we lost
since we got here...

09:12.469 --> 09:14.130
They'd all be alive.

09:14.221 --> 09:16.462
And what about us?

09:19.143 --> 09:22.977
We just go on living our life

09:23.063 --> 09:26.351
because we've never met?

09:27.317 --> 09:30.150
All the misery we've been through...

09:30.237 --> 09:33.024
...we just wipe it clean.
Never happened.

09:33.157 --> 09:35.193
It was not all misery.

09:41.707 --> 09:43.993
Enough of it was.

09:52.676 --> 09:56.840
The man I shot.
What did he need the bomb for?

10:02.603 --> 10:06.141
I need you to tell me
why he needed the bomb.

10:06.231 --> 10:08.347
I don't think you'd believe me ifl did.

10:15.908 --> 10:20.948
When I was 17 years old,
I took a young man to the bomb.

10:21.038 --> 10:24.121
He proceeded to tell me
that if we buried it underground,

10:24.208 --> 10:26.199
things would work out splendidly.

10:26.293 --> 10:29.626
When I asked him
how he could be so sure...

10:31.381 --> 10:33.463
...he said that he was from the future.

10:36.929 --> 10:39.215
And then he disappeared.

10:40.140 --> 10:42.597
Right in front of my bloody eyes.

10:43.101 --> 10:48.095
Ten minutes ago,
I shot that man in the back.

10:48.774 --> 10:51.311
And before he died...

10:53.403 --> 10:54.904
...he told me that he...

10:56.406 --> 10:57.942
He said he was my son.

11:01.578 --> 11:06.914
Explain to me,
and you have my word I will believe you.

11:11.797 --> 11:15.085
How is this my handwriting
ifl don't remember writing it?

11:22.099 --> 11:24.841
Because you haven't written it yet.

11:25.978 --> 11:27.843
I know this is hard to understand.

11:28.522 --> 11:32.606
But what you just did...

11:33.944 --> 11:35.809
It was an accident.

11:35.946 --> 11:38.858
And I think there's a way
for you to take it all back.

11:40.951 --> 11:41.986
What?

11:42.119 --> 11:46.738
Your son came back here,
because he had figured out a way

11:46.832 --> 11:48.038
to change things.

11:48.125 --> 11:52.243
He doesn't have to be dead.
You don't have to have killed him.

11:52.337 --> 11:55.124
If we do what's written
in that journal...

11:57.467 --> 11:59.753
...none of this will have happened.

12:03.140 --> 12:05.222
Does he know what he's talking about?

12:06.476 --> 12:08.467
He thinks he does.

12:17.905 --> 12:20.647
All right, then.
I'll take you to the bomb.

12:23.160 --> 12:27.153
There'sjust one small issue, however.

12:27.873 --> 12:30.330
We secured it over 20 years ago
underground.

12:30.417 --> 12:32.203
But since that time,

12:32.336 --> 12:35.328
it appears someone's built
an entire village over it.

12:38.008 --> 12:40.249
The Dharma Initiative?

12:41.094 --> 12:46.589
However, it appears you've been
passing yourselves off as members, so...

12:47.434 --> 12:50.517
...I suppose coming and going
will be relatively simple.

12:51.772 --> 12:54.684
It might be a little bit
more complicated than that.

13:09.081 --> 13:11.413
That woman. Where is she now?

13:14.378 --> 13:15.584
I want my lawyer.

13:17.547 --> 13:21.165
- Stuart! What the hell are you doing?
- I'm getting answers!

13:21.259 --> 13:23.045
Where is she?

13:26.598 --> 13:29.965
Stop! Damn it, stop! That is an order.

13:30.060 --> 13:33.473
- I'm still in charge here!
- You were in charge, Horace.

13:33.563 --> 13:37.476
If we're gonna protect our people
and all the work we're doing here...

13:37.567 --> 13:40.559
You don't have the stomach
for what happens next.

13:46.034 --> 13:47.945
Phil.

13:57.504 --> 13:59.335
OK, Jim. Last chance.

14:00.340 --> 14:01.750
You tell me where she is...

14:06.680 --> 14:10.047
...or so help me God, I will kill you.

14:15.981 --> 14:17.061
Hey!

14:17.607 --> 14:19.268
You ready to talk now?

14:22.154 --> 14:23.189
Nope.

14:25.449 --> 14:27.440
I'm getting tired of this, too, Jim.

14:27.534 --> 14:31.743
So why don't you tell me
where your girlfriend took the boy.

14:31.830 --> 14:36.199
She bring him to the Hostiles?
You know where they are?

14:41.757 --> 14:44.920
Stop! Stop! Please!

14:45.010 --> 14:47.877
You want me to stop?
Then tell me what I want to know!

14:47.971 --> 14:50.838
Stuart, please.

14:50.932 --> 14:54.641
We have known each other
for three years.

14:54.728 --> 14:58.471
We're not bad people.
We're not here to hurt you.

14:58.565 --> 14:59.896
Juliet...

15:01.443 --> 15:02.979
Don't.

15:06.239 --> 15:09.231
Whatever you tell 'em,
they ain't gonna believe you.

15:10.494 --> 15:12.655
It's only gonna get more people hurt.

15:15.082 --> 15:17.073
What are we doing, man?

15:18.251 --> 15:22.244
Beating him is pointless.
OK? He's not gonna talk.

15:22.339 --> 15:23.704
I can make him talk.

15:32.808 --> 15:34.423
You son of a bitch!

15:35.185 --> 15:37.767
- Easy.
- You're a dead man, Phil.

15:41.691 --> 15:43.101
I'm gonna kill you.

15:43.777 --> 15:44.766
Mr. Radzinsky?

15:44.861 --> 15:49.150
Still no sign of Miles or Jin,
but the recruits from last week?

15:49.241 --> 15:53.450
I got their sub's manifest from Amy.
There were three last minute add-ons.

15:53.537 --> 15:56.370
The two people who shot at you,
Shepherd and Austen,

15:56.456 --> 16:00.165
and one guy we can't track down.
He's gotta be a part of this.

16:02.546 --> 16:05.083
Who the hell is Hugo Reyes?

16:05.173 --> 16:06.208
He's the fat guy.

16:43.628 --> 16:44.959
What's the rescue plan?

16:45.046 --> 16:49.210
Rescue plan? We're heading to the beach.
Why you think we sent you for food?

16:49.301 --> 16:51.462
They got Sawyer and Juliet.

16:51.553 --> 16:54.010
There are 30 of them,
and they all have guns.

16:54.097 --> 16:56.509
Only people we can rescue is ourselves.

16:56.600 --> 16:59.717
We gotta do something.
Sawyer'd never leave us behind.

17:07.319 --> 17:09.605
Dr. Chang? What are you doing here?

17:11.239 --> 17:13.150
I could ask you the same question.

17:14.492 --> 17:15.948
Well, we asked you first.

17:18.121 --> 17:21.329
Your friend Faraday
said that you were from the future.

17:21.416 --> 17:24.078
I need to know
if he was telling the truth.

17:26.713 --> 17:28.578
Dude. That's ridiculous!

17:29.507 --> 17:30.917
What year were you born?

17:32.093 --> 17:33.128
What year?

17:33.220 --> 17:34.881
Nineteen... thirty-one?

17:34.971 --> 17:36.381
You're 46?

17:37.182 --> 17:39.173
Yeah. Yes, I am.

17:39.267 --> 17:41.474
So you fought in the Korean War.

17:43.521 --> 17:44.977
There's no such thing.

17:47.359 --> 17:50.101
Who's the President
of the United States?

17:52.072 --> 17:54.279
All right, dude. We're from the future.

17:54.366 --> 17:55.526
Sorry.

17:59.287 --> 18:00.697
It's true, then?

18:03.333 --> 18:04.994
You are my son?

18:08.171 --> 18:09.672
Yeah. It's true.

18:13.260 --> 18:15.216
Your friend, the physicist...

18:15.303 --> 18:17.965
He told me to evacuate
everyone off the island.

18:18.056 --> 18:21.674
He said there was going to be
a massive accident at the Swan.

18:21.768 --> 18:22.848
Is that true?

18:25.855 --> 18:28.187
He's been right about everything so far.

18:28.275 --> 18:31.312
lf Faraday said
get people off the island...

18:35.282 --> 18:36.317
...I'd do it.

18:39.411 --> 18:42.278
Well. Then let's hope
he knows what he's doing.

18:49.462 --> 18:51.839
Tell me something.

18:52.590 --> 18:55.457
Why is it that this man looks...

18:56.636 --> 18:57.921
...familiar to me?

18:59.306 --> 19:02.048
Richard,
you and Erik are coming with me.

19:03.310 --> 19:04.971
Going with you where?

19:05.061 --> 19:06.392
You can untie them.

19:07.439 --> 19:10.602
And would you mind giving us a moment?

19:23.872 --> 19:26.329
- I'm taking them to the bomb.
- What?

19:27.792 --> 19:29.999
Are you insane?

19:40.347 --> 19:42.303
Who is he?

19:45.977 --> 19:49.094
The man you're asking about,
Jack, is Charles Widmore.

19:51.608 --> 19:53.894
He and Eloise are...

19:55.403 --> 19:58.361
Well, let'sjust say
love can be complicated.

20:04.079 --> 20:06.616
All right. Let's move out.

20:11.503 --> 20:13.209
So, John.

20:13.296 --> 20:17.209
Are you ready to tell me
where you've been the last three years?

20:18.551 --> 20:20.382
You really don't know?

20:21.638 --> 20:25.096
I know that
on the day Ben here turned the wheel,

20:25.183 --> 20:27.765
you and l were sitting on a log,

20:27.852 --> 20:30.764
there was a bright light,
there was a loud noise,

20:30.855 --> 20:33.722
and then you just... disappeared.

20:33.817 --> 20:37.184
Well, Richard, you're about to see
where l disappeared to.

20:37.278 --> 20:40.486
After we're finished,
I'd like you to take me to see Jacob.

20:43.410 --> 20:46.152
That's not how it works, John.

20:47.080 --> 20:49.947
Is that true, Richard?
Is this going to be a problem?

20:50.750 --> 20:53.708
You just got back.
There's no reason to rush into...

20:53.795 --> 20:57.253
I am the leader now, right?

20:59.175 --> 21:01.257
- Yes, John. That's right.
- Good.

21:01.344 --> 21:04.632
Then I'd like you to take me to Jacob.
Can you do that?

21:05.473 --> 21:06.508
Of course.

21:07.267 --> 21:10.851
Fantastic. Let's keep moving.
We're almost to the plane.

21:12.856 --> 21:14.721
What plane?

21:34.377 --> 21:37.119
It's a Beechcraft,
used to smuggle heroin.

21:37.213 --> 21:39.124
Flew out of Nigeria, crashed here.

21:40.550 --> 21:43.257
Richard, listen carefully,
because you only have

21:43.344 --> 21:45.471
about three minutes to get this right.

21:45.555 --> 21:47.216
Get what right?

21:47.307 --> 21:49.423
A man's about to
walk out of the jungle.

21:49.517 --> 21:51.382
He's been shot in the leg.

21:54.063 --> 21:56.224
You'll need this to get the bullet out.

21:58.568 --> 21:59.978
I'm sorry, John...

22:00.069 --> 22:02.060
Listen. This is the important part.

22:02.906 --> 22:08.276
You need to tell him he has to bring
everyone who left back to the island.

22:08.369 --> 22:10.951
And when he asks how to do that...

22:12.040 --> 22:14.201
You tell him he's going to have to die.

22:26.429 --> 22:28.920
Who is that man, John?

22:30.225 --> 22:32.466
Me.

23:03.007 --> 23:04.122
Richard.

23:05.718 --> 23:09.006
Richard, what is happening?

23:09.138 --> 23:11.845
What's happening
is you're bleeding to death.

23:18.481 --> 23:20.187
I need to get the bullet out.

23:23.695 --> 23:26.607
How did you know
there was a bullet in my leg, Richard?

23:26.698 --> 23:28.780
Because you told me there was, John.

23:28.866 --> 23:30.527
N0, I didn't.

23:31.619 --> 23:33.996
Well... You will.

23:37.000 --> 23:40.037
This must be
quite the out of body experience.

23:40.169 --> 23:42.421
Something like that.

23:42.505 --> 23:47.465
Your timing was impeccable, John.
How'd you know when to be here?

23:48.970 --> 23:50.801
The island told me.

23:52.849 --> 23:55.716
- Didn't it ever tell you things?
- No, John.

23:55.852 --> 23:59.436
And it hasn't told you where
Jacob is or you wouldn't need Richard.

23:59.522 --> 24:01.058
You've never seen him.

24:01.190 --> 24:03.226
- What?
- Jacob.

24:03.359 --> 24:05.395
You've never seen him, have you?

24:15.705 --> 24:20.074
Whatjust happened? Where did you go?

24:20.209 --> 24:23.042
To give Richard his compass back.

24:30.011 --> 24:31.126
Want the bullet?

24:31.220 --> 24:33.051
Keep it.

24:34.015 --> 24:35.425
Everything go all right?

24:35.558 --> 24:38.140
Well, you seemed pretty convinced.

24:38.227 --> 24:40.559
Especially when I said
you were gonna die.

24:40.647 --> 24:43.104
Certainly glad
that didn't have to happen.

24:44.359 --> 24:47.066
Actually, Richard... it did.

24:53.451 --> 24:55.191
We better get back to camp.

25:05.421 --> 25:08.208
You need to evacuate
the island of all personnel

25:08.299 --> 25:09.880
and you need to do it...

25:11.344 --> 25:15.007
- What the hell is going on?
- Aren't you supposed to be at the Swan?

25:15.098 --> 25:17.430
We break ground in less than 20 hours.

25:17.517 --> 25:19.132
We're under imminent threat!

25:19.268 --> 25:23.056
If we start drilling, there's a
high probability of a cataclysmic...

25:23.147 --> 25:26.560
We are drilling and on schedule.

25:26.651 --> 25:30.485
- Horace, you're in charge...
- He's not in charge anymore.

25:32.115 --> 25:35.152
This is my decision, and it's been made.

25:35.284 --> 25:37.741
- We keep working.
- Put us on the sub.

25:42.917 --> 25:46.205
He's right. It ain't safe.

25:47.463 --> 25:51.126
Put the women and children
on the sub and get 'em out of here.

25:56.347 --> 25:59.089
And if you put me and Juliet
on the sub with 'em...

25:59.976 --> 26:02.513
...we'll tell you anything
you want to know.

26:09.026 --> 26:10.982
You OK with that, sweetheart?

26:12.321 --> 26:13.606
Absolutely.

26:13.698 --> 26:16.064
You want on that sub, Jim?

26:22.165 --> 26:23.621
Draw me a map.

26:23.708 --> 26:27.166
I wanna know exactly
where the Hostiles are.

26:39.348 --> 26:41.680
You two know how to swim?

26:42.727 --> 26:44.433
Why don't we just go around it?

26:44.520 --> 26:46.727
No, dear, we need to go in.

26:46.856 --> 26:50.019
We have to swim under the pond
to get to the tunnels.

26:50.693 --> 26:53.810
- I'm not going.
- What?

26:53.905 --> 26:56.567
I'm gonna go back
and find everyone else.

26:56.699 --> 26:58.781
I can't go any further with you.

26:58.868 --> 27:00.404
- Not this time.
- Kate...

27:00.536 --> 27:03.152
You can't go back there.
They know about us.

27:03.247 --> 27:05.033
They tried to kill us.

27:05.750 --> 27:07.365
And what are you trying to do?

27:10.713 --> 27:11.873
Bye, Jack.

27:13.257 --> 27:15.999
- You're not going anywhere.
- Don't need to do that.

27:16.093 --> 27:18.300
We're not telling our secrets
to strangers

27:18.387 --> 27:20.002
then letting them saunter off.

27:20.097 --> 27:23.180
I don't care about your secrets.
| just want to leave.

27:23.267 --> 27:24.473
- Put the gun...
- Step away!

27:24.560 --> 27:26.721
- If she wants to leave...
- I said stop!

27:49.085 --> 27:50.825
What are we doing here, Eloise?

27:50.920 --> 27:53.002
That man just killed one of our people

27:53.089 --> 27:55.330
and you're acting like
it doesn't matter.

27:55.424 --> 27:58.632
If these people are right
about what they're about to do...

27:58.761 --> 28:01.468
- ...it won't matter.
- And what are they about to do?

28:02.557 --> 28:06.766
So you're telling me you're going to
erase the last three years of our lives?

28:06.894 --> 28:08.680
We can change things, Sayid.

28:08.771 --> 28:12.355
I don't know if you're aware
but I've already changed things.

28:12.441 --> 28:14.773
I killed Benjamin Linus.

28:14.902 --> 28:16.608
And we're all still here.

28:16.696 --> 28:19.187
That's because you didn't kill him.

28:19.282 --> 28:22.774
Sawyer and me took him to
the Others so that they could save him.

28:27.456 --> 28:28.787
Why did you do that?

28:28.916 --> 28:31.532
Why did I do that?

28:31.627 --> 28:36.291
Since when did shooting kids and
blowing up hydrogen bombs become OK?

28:36.424 --> 28:39.666
The three of us disappeared
off that plane and ended up here,

28:39.802 --> 28:42.714
ended up now, because
this is our chance to change things.

28:42.805 --> 28:46.548
If you're wrong,
then everyone on the island dies.

28:46.642 --> 28:48.724
- Do you understand?
- I'm not wrong.

28:48.811 --> 28:51.598
This is it. This is why we're here.

28:55.484 --> 28:57.224
This is our destiny.

28:57.320 --> 28:59.106
Do you know who you sound like?

29:01.032 --> 29:04.274
Because he was crazy, too, Jack.
You said so yourself.

29:05.202 --> 29:08.490
- Maybe I was wrong.
- No, you were right.

29:10.750 --> 29:13.241
I'm going back to find
the rest of our people,

29:13.336 --> 29:16.123
because if I can't stop you,
maybe they can.

29:25.181 --> 29:27.422
The submarine departs in 30 minutes.

29:27.516 --> 29:30.349
All evacuees,
please proceed to the dock.

29:33.481 --> 29:35.597
Come now, Charlotte.

29:40.029 --> 29:42.236
This is ridiculous. I could help you.

29:42.365 --> 29:44.447
No, you can't. Just move over there.

29:45.993 --> 29:49.110
I want you to leave! Now!

29:49.205 --> 29:51.992
Why's he yelling at her, dude?

29:53.876 --> 29:56.117
It's the only way
he can get her to leave.

29:58.839 --> 30:00.045
Sorry, man.

30:00.716 --> 30:03.549
- We'd better get moving.
- Wait a second.

30:04.136 --> 30:06.001
It's Jim and Juliet.

30:06.931 --> 30:10.389
Why the hell are they
putting them on the sub?

30:15.731 --> 30:17.517
Don't worry, it's gonna be OK.

30:17.608 --> 30:19.690
Sawyer always has a plan, right?

30:25.199 --> 30:26.439
We'll buy Microsoft.

30:26.575 --> 30:29.157
Excuse me?

30:29.245 --> 30:34.160
Then we'll bet the Cowboys in the '78
Super Bowl. We're gonna be rich.

30:37.503 --> 30:39.164
Look, I'm sorry.

30:39.255 --> 30:43.089
I should've listened when you wanted
to get on this sub three years ago.

30:43.175 --> 30:45.917
I'm glad you talked me out of it.

30:53.060 --> 30:55.142
Come on, LaFleur. Get in.

30:57.898 --> 30:59.308
Ladies first.

31:19.295 --> 31:21.126
Good riddance.

31:38.606 --> 31:42.645
lfl don't see you on the other side,
I won't blame you.

31:46.489 --> 31:49.652
Now take a deep breath
and follow Richard under.

31:50.159 --> 31:53.777
There's an opening in the bottom
of the rocks at the far side.

32:45.381 --> 32:47.667
That was a little further
than I thought.

32:49.844 --> 32:50.924
Where are we?

32:51.762 --> 32:52.797
The tunnels.

32:55.516 --> 32:58.804
You want to tell me how
we're going to get a bomb out of here?

32:59.562 --> 33:01.348
The same way we brought it in.

33:02.815 --> 33:05.898
- You don't mean through the pool.
- It's a 12-foot long,

33:06.026 --> 33:07.732
40,000 pound hydrogen bomb.

33:07.820 --> 33:09.731
No. Not through the pool.

33:32.720 --> 33:34.631
Didn't think you'd come.

33:34.763 --> 33:38.255
If this works,
you mightjust save us all.

33:38.392 --> 33:41.759
And if it doesn't? At least
you'll put us out of our misery.

33:51.822 --> 33:54.199
All right, let's get started.

34:32.279 --> 34:34.770
I'll have a tent prepared for you, John.

34:34.865 --> 34:36.730
We'll get going first thing.

34:36.825 --> 34:39.487
I thought we could leave right now.

34:39.620 --> 34:42.828
- Now?
- l'm eager.

34:48.295 --> 34:51.879
Whatever you want, but maybe
the two of us should go to my tent...

34:52.007 --> 34:53.167
Is this everyone?

34:54.510 --> 34:56.751
There's another group at the Temple...

34:56.845 --> 35:00.929
If you don't mind,
I'd like to talk to everyone here. Now.

35:01.016 --> 35:04.508
Of course. Be my guest.

35:12.152 --> 35:15.644
Hello, everyone. My name is John Locke.

35:16.907 --> 35:20.195
I've been told that, for some time,

35:20.286 --> 35:23.699
you all have been accepting orders
from a man named Jacob.

35:23.831 --> 35:27.449
And yet, oddly enough, it seems
that no one has actually seen him.

35:28.711 --> 35:32.124
Now, I'm sure there are
very good reasons why his existence

35:32.214 --> 35:37.208
and whereabouts are secret,
I just don't know what they are.

35:40.889 --> 35:44.381
And to be honest with you,
if there's a man telling us what to do,

35:44.518 --> 35:45.883
I want to know who he is.

35:47.479 --> 35:49.731
This man... Jacob?

35:49.857 --> 35:53.725
Can he tell us how to bring Jin
and the rest of our people back here?

35:53.861 --> 35:55.351
Absolutely.

35:59.908 --> 36:02.650
Richard has agreed
to show us where we need to go.

36:02.745 --> 36:06.237
So I'm gonna go and see Jacob.
Right now.

36:09.251 --> 36:12.869
And I'd like all of you to come with me.

36:24.183 --> 36:27.425
I'm starting to think
John Locke is going to be trouble.

36:29.021 --> 36:31.933
Why do you think I tried to kill him?

36:47.998 --> 36:49.534
We're shovin' off in two minutes.

36:49.625 --> 36:52.458
Appreciate it
if you didn't cause us any trouble.

36:53.128 --> 36:55.289
Wouldn't think of it, Nemo.

36:55.964 --> 36:58.956
What are we going to do
when we get to Ann Arbor?

37:00.636 --> 37:02.217
We ain't goin' to Ann Arbor.

37:02.304 --> 37:05.011
- What do you mean?
- These guys ain't cops.

37:05.140 --> 37:08.348
They got no authority over us
back in the real world.

37:10.104 --> 37:12.311
Once we dock wherever we dock...

37:13.774 --> 37:14.980
...we're free.

37:15.776 --> 37:16.811
"Real world."

37:21.031 --> 37:23.647
I don't even know
what that means anymore.

37:34.211 --> 37:38.329
Whatever happens,
I got your back. Remember?

37:39.716 --> 37:40.842
I love you.

37:42.678 --> 37:44.418
Well, I love you back.

37:44.513 --> 37:46.595
Hold on! Don't close the hatch!

37:46.682 --> 37:48.889
Horace wants her off the island, too.

37:49.017 --> 37:51.508
We'll let Ann Arbor deal with them.

37:51.854 --> 37:54.391
Actually caught her
coming back into town.

37:55.858 --> 37:57.894
Cuff her over there with the others.

38:17.963 --> 38:19.203
Hey.

38:21.884 --> 38:22.999
Hey.

38:28.974 --> 38:32.558
Clear the bridge. All personnel,
lay below on the double.

38:33.729 --> 38:36.892
We're away.
Engineering, take your stations.

38:37.566 --> 38:39.147
Boat is clear for sea.

38:39.234 --> 38:42.397
All hands to your stations.
Prepare to dive.

38:43.780 --> 38:45.941
Clear the bridge. All hands below.

38:47.242 --> 38:48.357
Stand by main vents.

38:48.452 --> 38:50.534
Diving positions.

38:53.707 --> 38:56.244
- Stand by on ballast tanks.
- Ship is secure for dive.

38:56.376 --> 38:58.833
Ship is secure for dive.
Stand by for dive.

38:58.921 --> 39:00.957
Trim to dive, please.

39:25.697 --> 39:26.982
Jack.

39:28.450 --> 39:31.738
I'm sure it's occurred to you
that this woman's motivation

39:31.828 --> 39:34.080
in helping us detonate a hydrogen bomb

39:34.164 --> 39:36.997
is only to annihilate
the Dharma Initiative?

39:37.125 --> 39:39.411
Yes. But I still trust her.

39:39.503 --> 39:40.959
Why?

39:41.046 --> 39:45.289
Thirty years from now she's gonna
tell us how to get back to the island.

39:45.425 --> 39:47.507
And that makes you trust her?

40:33.724 --> 40:35.180
Well...

40:36.393 --> 40:37.508
Now what?

41:15.849 --> 41:17.714
Beautiful day, isn't it?

41:17.851 --> 41:19.352
Yes, so far.

41:21.355 --> 41:23.721
Richard had some concerns.

41:24.566 --> 41:26.522
Concerns about what?

41:26.610 --> 41:29.522
This pilgrimage to Jacob
makes him uncomfortable.

41:29.613 --> 41:31.524
He's expressed...

41:31.615 --> 41:35.403
...reservations about whether or not
you know what you're doing.

41:38.664 --> 41:42.077
I appreciate you
bringing this to my attention, Ben.

41:42.626 --> 41:44.992
I know we've had our differences, John,

41:45.087 --> 41:47.829
but I'm here to follow you now.

41:47.923 --> 41:51.666
So if you need Jacob to help you
reunite your people, then I'll do...

41:51.760 --> 41:54.752
I'm not interested
in reuniting with my people.

41:56.139 --> 41:57.925
What do you mean? You told Sun...

41:58.058 --> 42:01.550
I know what I told her,
but that's not why we're going to Jacob.

42:02.312 --> 42:03.973
Then why are we going to Jacob?

42:05.607 --> 42:07.598
So I can kill him.
