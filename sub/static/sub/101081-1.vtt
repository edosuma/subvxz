WEBVTT

01:09.361 --> 01:11.906
HANNA:
If we're never going to leave,

01:11.947 --> 01:14.033
then why are you training me?

01:16.160 --> 01:17.495
ERIK:
Because one day,

01:17.578 --> 01:19.205
I may not be here
to protect you,

01:19.246 --> 01:21.457
and you'll have to cope
on your own.

03:39.261 --> 03:40.596
:
All trainees,

03:40.638 --> 03:42.264
please gather all your affairs

03:42.306 --> 03:44.099
and collect
at meeting point "G"

03:44.141 --> 03:45.976
for immediate onward...

03:46.018 --> 03:48.520
Where are we going?
Why do they keep moving us?

03:48.562 --> 03:52.191
WOMAN:
Further information
will be given in transit.

04:35.192 --> 04:37.319
:
We are approaching
our destination.

04:37.361 --> 04:40.656
All trainees should prepare
for disembarkation.

04:52.167 --> 04:54.753
Welcome to the Meadows.

05:30.247 --> 05:31.707
MAN:
Marissa.

05:31.749 --> 05:33.709
-John.
-Ah.

05:33.751 --> 05:35.502
Wasn't sure you'd recognize me.

05:35.544 --> 05:37.755
It's been a while.

05:37.796 --> 05:40.007
How's your leg? Getting better?

05:40.049 --> 05:42.968
Uh, it's been better
for two weeks.

05:43.010 --> 05:44.970
Why are you here?

05:46.013 --> 05:48.057
Well, I'm afraid
there are a few issues

05:48.098 --> 05:50.267
that need clearing up.

05:50.309 --> 05:53.896
Around what happened
at the Utrax facility.

05:53.937 --> 05:55.939
How do you even know about that?

05:59.234 --> 06:01.779
I don't want to waste
too much of your time.

06:01.820 --> 06:03.822
Shall we begin?

06:04.948 --> 06:07.493
Mm-hmm.

06:07.534 --> 06:09.536
WOMAN:
Who is this?

06:09.578 --> 06:11.538
MARISSA:
This is Marissa Wiegler.

06:11.580 --> 06:14.750
I'm at the Utrax facility.

06:14.792 --> 06:17.544
Jerome Sawyer's dead.
I'm wounded.

06:17.586 --> 06:19.880
-Erik Heller shot me.
-

06:20.881 --> 06:22.508
I need assistance.

06:22.549 --> 06:24.134
WOMAN:
Where is Heller?

06:24.176 --> 06:25.803
MARISSA:
He's gone,

06:25.844 --> 06:27.930
but he's badly injured.

06:27.971 --> 06:29.640
He won't survive.

06:29.681 --> 06:31.683
WOMAN:
And the girl?

06:33.102 --> 06:34.728
MARISSA:
She, uh...

06:34.770 --> 06:36.146
she got away.

06:39.191 --> 06:40.943
So let me get this straight.

06:40.984 --> 06:42.945
-Heller killed Jerome Sawyer.
-Mm-hmm.

06:42.986 --> 06:45.531
He was escaping with Hanna
and the other girl.

06:45.572 --> 06:46.782
I tried to stop them.

06:46.824 --> 06:48.826
-And he shot you in the leg?
-Mm-hmm.

06:53.580 --> 06:55.541
Why were you there?

06:55.582 --> 06:57.709
Sawyer's report seems to suggest

06:57.751 --> 07:00.170
that you shouldn't have been
on that operation at all.

07:01.213 --> 07:03.507
Sawyer and I
didn't see eye to eye

07:03.549 --> 07:07.261
on how to address Erik's
reemergence from the forest.

07:09.888 --> 07:13.809
Well, you were right
about Heller.

07:14.852 --> 07:16.728
He didn't make it.

07:18.188 --> 07:20.399
The girls buried him
in a rural graveyard.

07:20.440 --> 07:22.651
Next to the mother.
Sentimental reasons, I imagine.

07:23.694 --> 07:24.820
We disposed of him

07:24.862 --> 07:27.447
in a more strategic fashion.

07:27.489 --> 07:29.449
Hmm.

07:29.491 --> 07:32.661
Um, would you care
to come with me for a moment?

07:45.549 --> 07:47.509
Where are we going?

07:47.551 --> 07:48.927
It's right down here.

07:48.969 --> 07:50.387
Won't take long.

07:51.638 --> 07:53.640
Through this door.

07:58.478 --> 08:00.439
I don't understand.

08:00.480 --> 08:02.441
What's in there?

08:02.482 --> 08:04.359
Don't worry, Marissa.

08:04.401 --> 08:06.403
It's just me.

08:15.829 --> 08:17.539
So...

08:18.582 --> 08:20.834
Let's go back to the beginning.

08:22.836 --> 08:24.379
MAN:
We have the results

08:24.421 --> 08:27.424
of your ALC training tests.

08:27.466 --> 08:29.176
-Congratulations.
-Thank you, sir.

08:29.218 --> 08:30.677
So, you think you're ready?

08:30.719 --> 08:32.554
Well, I'd rather not sit
at a training console

08:32.596 --> 08:34.723
-for another year.
-That's good.

08:34.765 --> 08:37.893
-So, we can put you
straight on the NSA main floor.
-Mm-hmm.

08:37.935 --> 08:39.603
You'd be assigned to a desk.

08:39.645 --> 08:41.605
Comms and SIGINT analysis.

08:41.647 --> 08:42.940
Phone calls.

08:42.981 --> 08:44.816
Cryptographic decoding.

08:44.858 --> 08:46.485
It's the usual process

08:46.526 --> 08:48.487
for someone transitioning
from military intelligence

08:48.528 --> 08:50.948
to an analysis-led arena.

08:53.033 --> 08:54.534
Or?

08:55.577 --> 08:58.372
There is another possibility.

08:58.413 --> 09:00.791
It's in the field.

09:00.832 --> 09:02.793
It's kind of unusual.

09:02.834 --> 09:05.212
Classified project.

09:05.254 --> 09:07.214
And we would only want you
to do it

09:07.256 --> 09:09.508
if you felt it was right for you
at this time.

09:10.550 --> 09:11.802
Where is it?

09:11.843 --> 09:13.595
Abroad.

09:13.637 --> 09:15.055
That's a little vague, sir.

09:17.099 --> 09:18.433
If you're interested,

09:18.475 --> 09:20.018
I'd have to ask you to sign this

09:20.060 --> 09:22.229
before I tell you anything more.

09:42.582 --> 09:44.543
Welcome.

09:44.584 --> 09:46.962
-

10:25.625 --> 10:28.503
ERIK:
I wish we could
stay here forever.

10:32.507 --> 10:35.469
I can feel your heartbeat.

10:41.516 --> 10:43.518
You feel it?

10:45.020 --> 10:46.980
What is that?

10:48.982 --> 10:50.650
Nothing.

10:50.692 --> 10:53.195
Did they give it to you?

10:53.236 --> 10:55.655
They said it keeps us calm.

10:56.698 --> 10:57.908
What are you doing?

11:15.467 --> 11:18.011
You don't need this anymore.

11:36.113 --> 11:37.906
Welcome, everybody.

11:37.948 --> 11:40.033
My name's Leo Garner.

11:40.075 --> 11:42.077
Please take your seats.

11:45.080 --> 11:49.042
So... let's make a start.

11:49.084 --> 11:51.044
WOMAN:
Hi, there.

11:51.086 --> 11:54.047
My name's Joanne McCoy,
and I'm your group leader.

11:54.089 --> 11:57.050
You're now entering the second
stage of your development.

11:57.092 --> 11:58.885
You're gonna notice some changes

11:58.927 --> 12:01.096
in the way we work
here at the Meadows.

12:01.138 --> 12:03.014
You're gonna have more freedom,

12:03.056 --> 12:06.226
and you're gonna be able
to ask more questions of us.

12:06.268 --> 12:10.105
Medication will be reduced
and rules relaxed

12:10.147 --> 12:13.775
as we prepare you for the next
stage of your journey.

12:13.817 --> 12:15.861
You'll shortly receive your
personalized character profile

12:15.902 --> 12:17.487
that will tell you
all you need to know

12:17.529 --> 12:19.114
about your new identities.

12:19.156 --> 12:20.949
Take time to read it.

12:20.991 --> 12:23.618
It contains all you need
to know about yourself,

12:23.660 --> 12:25.996
your family history,
your schooling,

12:26.037 --> 12:27.831
your place of birth,
where you grew up,

12:27.873 --> 12:29.416
your hobbies and interests,

12:29.458 --> 12:32.461
your aspirations
and your dreams.

12:38.091 --> 12:40.260
CARMICHAEL:
Operation Utrax.

12:40.302 --> 12:43.805
Initiated in 2002,
Darabani, Romania,

12:43.847 --> 12:45.807
to explore in utero enhancement

12:45.849 --> 12:48.310
of genetic makeup
in early-stage embryos.

12:48.351 --> 12:52.772
Wolf DNA implanted
into a three-month-old fetus,

12:52.814 --> 12:54.691
to affect bone density,

12:54.733 --> 12:56.067
sensory sensibility

12:56.109 --> 12:58.528
and reduced susceptibility
to disease.

12:58.570 --> 13:01.281
All with the intention
of creating

13:01.323 --> 13:03.658
a perfectly refined
military tool.

13:03.700 --> 13:05.285
Did you know about it
all these years?

13:05.327 --> 13:07.496
I thought I was keeping it
secret from you.

13:07.537 --> 13:09.331
I was the one
who recommended you.

13:11.249 --> 13:13.793
You closed the operation in 2003

13:13.835 --> 13:17.547
after Erik Heller's
unfortunate intervention.

13:17.589 --> 13:20.759
-We reopened it in 2004.
-Without telling me.

13:20.800 --> 13:23.470
CARMICHAEL:
It was decided
a clean slate was necessary.

13:23.512 --> 13:27.224
The DNA enhancements
are now synthetic,

13:27.265 --> 13:29.976
modeled on the same material
but now nonorganic.

13:30.018 --> 13:32.312
And this time...

13:32.354 --> 13:34.439
it worked.

13:34.481 --> 13:35.899
Where are they?

13:37.150 --> 13:39.611
They're
in socialization training,

13:39.653 --> 13:41.613
developing their new identities.

13:41.655 --> 13:43.615
When socialization is complete,

13:43.657 --> 13:46.826
they'll be transferred
into the field.

13:47.911 --> 13:49.538
They'll live in the real world,

13:49.579 --> 13:52.082
normally, quietly.

13:52.123 --> 13:53.750
And all we have to do
is flip a switch,

13:53.792 --> 13:55.085
and they'll do whatever we ask.

13:55.126 --> 13:57.671
100% deniability.

13:57.712 --> 13:59.256
I mean,

13:59.297 --> 14:02.092
who's really gonna suspect
an 18-year-old freshman

14:02.133 --> 14:04.886
in pigtails
of state-sponsored murder?

14:06.471 --> 14:09.432
And 100% reliable.

14:09.474 --> 14:11.476
Or so we thought.

14:11.518 --> 14:13.353
According
to the gospel of Utrax,

14:13.395 --> 14:14.980
Trainee 249 shouldn't have had

14:15.021 --> 14:17.649
the ability to disobey orders
in the way she did.

14:17.691 --> 14:20.569
We need to determine
why that happened

14:20.610 --> 14:22.821
and how to prevent it
in the future.

14:22.862 --> 14:25.073
To do that,

14:25.115 --> 14:27.409
we need to bring her back.

14:27.450 --> 14:28.827
That's why I'm here.

14:30.287 --> 14:32.122
That's why I need your help.

14:47.262 --> 14:49.681
Hello?

14:52.142 --> 14:54.811
into some trouble

14:58.982 --> 15:01.901
getting doubled

15:12.787 --> 15:17.250
and I am crossing over

15:20.670 --> 15:22.464
Come on. Let's go.

15:22.505 --> 15:24.591
and we'll call it home

15:52.869 --> 15:53.828
HANNA:
Are you okay?

15:53.870 --> 15:55.705
Hmm?

15:58.958 --> 16:02.212
Why couldn't we stay in one
of those cabins we steal from?

16:02.253 --> 16:03.630
They're warmer.

16:03.672 --> 16:05.465
It's too close to the edge
of the forest,

16:05.507 --> 16:07.467
and people come and stay in them
all the time.

16:07.509 --> 16:10.053
It's not safe.

16:18.812 --> 16:20.188
Mm.

16:20.230 --> 16:22.232
Let's eat, huh?

16:23.608 --> 16:24.818
LEO:
All right, everyone.

16:24.859 --> 16:26.069
Please sit down.

16:30.407 --> 16:32.325
Okay.

16:32.367 --> 16:36.162
So, the aim
of these sessions, guys,

16:36.204 --> 16:38.373
is to introduce you
to the dangers

16:38.415 --> 16:41.209
in the world outside,

16:41.251 --> 16:44.879
dangers you will be fighting
on behalf of our government

16:44.921 --> 16:47.465
and people everywhere.

16:47.507 --> 16:49.300
Now, to be able to fight
these dangers,

16:49.342 --> 16:52.053
you'll need all the combat
and operational skills

16:52.095 --> 16:53.263
you've been developing,

16:53.304 --> 16:55.515
but you'll also need
to understand the world

16:55.557 --> 16:57.892
and how it's come
to be this way.

17:50.445 --> 17:54.532
of a child.

18:36.324 --> 18:38.451
Terri.

18:38.493 --> 18:40.119
My name's Leo Garner.

18:40.161 --> 18:41.538
Hello.

18:41.579 --> 18:43.373
Welcome to the Meadows.

18:43.414 --> 18:45.375
Thank you.

18:50.463 --> 18:52.966
You see something we missed?

18:53.007 --> 18:54.968
If they're in the forest,
you'll never find them.

18:55.009 --> 18:56.553
It's thousands of miles,

18:56.594 --> 18:59.681
and Hanna knows that terrain
better than anyone.

18:59.722 --> 19:00.723
You found her last time.

19:00.765 --> 19:02.183
Last time, she made a mistake

19:02.225 --> 19:03.935
because she was frustrated
with her life.

19:03.977 --> 19:05.270
She won't do that again.

19:05.311 --> 19:08.773
Maybe you don't want us
to find her.

19:08.815 --> 19:11.150
What exactly do you mean
by that?

19:12.360 --> 19:14.153
Who took this photograph?

19:14.195 --> 19:16.406
MARISSA:
I did.

19:16.447 --> 19:18.366
Holiday snaps.

19:18.408 --> 19:19.951
Not like you.

19:19.993 --> 19:23.121
I needed to prove to Sawyer
I had Hanna in my care.

19:23.162 --> 19:25.707
Did you become attached to her?

19:25.748 --> 19:26.875
No, I did not.

19:26.916 --> 19:29.168
Perfectly natural
to have an affinity for her,

19:29.210 --> 19:31.671
given the past,
no child of your own.

19:31.713 --> 19:34.257
I don't feel anything, John.

19:34.299 --> 19:36.968
I'll let you know when I do.

19:38.761 --> 19:40.346
I'd like to go.

19:40.388 --> 19:42.515
You can't hold me here
against my will.

19:42.557 --> 19:44.267
You know that as well as I.

19:44.309 --> 19:45.685
Okay.

19:45.727 --> 19:47.562
Let me ask you something first.

19:47.604 --> 19:50.148
Are you lying to me?

19:50.189 --> 19:52.150
Did you really shoot Erik Heller

19:52.191 --> 19:56.571
or did you go to Utrax to kill
Sawyer and save Hanna's life?

19:56.613 --> 19:57.989
I think I know the answer.

19:58.031 --> 19:59.574
So, here's the deal:

19:59.616 --> 20:02.744
I stay quiet about what you did
and I leave Hanna alone,

20:02.785 --> 20:06.289
but you give me Trainee 249.

20:12.629 --> 20:15.006
How did your mother die?

20:15.048 --> 20:17.967
I told you.
I don't want to talk about it.

20:21.429 --> 20:23.890
Was she killed by them?

20:28.186 --> 20:30.647
Do you miss her?

20:30.688 --> 20:32.065
I never knew her.

20:32.106 --> 20:35.693
How can you miss someone
you've never met?

20:44.661 --> 20:47.038
-Hello. How are you today?
-I'm well, thank you.

20:47.080 --> 20:48.957
That's five dollars.
With rice or baked potato?

20:55.755 --> 20:57.256
TRAINEE 242:
She looks so weird,

20:57.298 --> 20:59.759
still in that old uniform.

20:59.801 --> 21:01.928
Not everyone's done it.

21:04.263 --> 21:05.556
I'm glad you did.

21:05.598 --> 21:08.059
It makes me feel better.

21:11.479 --> 21:13.690
What's the name they gave you?

21:13.731 --> 21:15.108
Sandy.

21:15.149 --> 21:17.276
I'm Jules.

21:17.318 --> 21:19.445
Hi, Jules.

21:19.487 --> 21:20.822
Hi, Sandy.

21:22.573 --> 21:24.283
Where are you from, apparently?

21:24.325 --> 21:26.035
Uh, I'm from Ohio.

21:26.077 --> 21:27.203
A small town.

21:27.245 --> 21:29.288
Bentleyville.

21:29.330 --> 21:32.041
What's that like?

21:32.083 --> 21:33.960
Beautiful.

21:34.002 --> 21:36.796
There's lots of forest
and rivers.

21:36.838 --> 21:39.048
And you go fishing
for pike and bass,

21:39.090 --> 21:41.300
except in the summer,
when it runs dry.

21:41.342 --> 21:43.052
I'm from Oregon.

21:43.094 --> 21:44.470
By the ocean.

21:44.512 --> 21:45.972
I surf.

21:46.014 --> 21:47.473
I have a boyfriend called Aaron.

21:47.515 --> 21:48.808
He's hot.

21:48.850 --> 21:51.102
Why is he hot?

21:51.144 --> 21:54.689
No, it means, like,
he's really handsome.

21:54.731 --> 21:57.608
Oh.

21:57.650 --> 21:59.402
Can I see him?

22:02.572 --> 22:04.949
SANDY:
He looks nice.

22:04.991 --> 22:06.451
He is.

22:06.492 --> 22:09.037
And I have a brother,
but I don't like him.

22:09.078 --> 22:11.205
It says he was mean to me
when I was young.

22:11.247 --> 22:12.790
Put beetles in my shoes.

22:12.832 --> 22:15.209
What a dumbass.

22:15.251 --> 22:17.628
Yeah.

22:17.670 --> 22:20.131
He is a dumbass.

22:20.173 --> 22:23.134
I have a brother and a sister,
too, but she's sick.

22:23.176 --> 22:25.053
It takes up a lot
of the family's attention.

22:25.094 --> 22:26.888
What's wrong with her?

22:26.929 --> 22:29.307
Muscular disease.

22:29.348 --> 22:30.391
It may be psychological.

22:30.433 --> 22:31.768
We don't know for sure.

22:31.809 --> 22:33.770
That must be annoying.

22:33.811 --> 22:36.147
No.

22:36.189 --> 22:37.899
I love her.

22:37.940 --> 22:39.567
MARISSA:
I need to talk
to the other trainees.

22:39.609 --> 22:41.235
The ones who were there.

22:54.123 --> 22:55.833
CARMICHAEL:
Hi, Sandy.

22:55.875 --> 22:57.251
That's your name, isn't it?

22:57.293 --> 23:00.296
-Yes.
-Hi. Uh, I know

23:00.338 --> 23:02.715
we already spoke to you about
this at Wilberforce Air Base,

23:02.757 --> 23:05.051
but I wanted to go through
one more time what happened,

23:05.093 --> 23:06.636
with Agent Hawkins here.

23:06.677 --> 23:09.305
About Trainee 249.

23:09.347 --> 23:12.016
I've told you everything I know.

23:12.058 --> 23:14.435
Sandy, my name's Joan.

23:14.477 --> 23:17.855
I'm really worried
about Trainee 249.

23:17.897 --> 23:19.690
She's missing the opportunity
to experience

23:19.732 --> 23:21.109
what you're experiencing,

23:21.150 --> 23:22.777
gaining a new life.

23:22.819 --> 23:26.197
I'd like to bring her back
and offer her that chance.

23:26.239 --> 23:29.367
But for that,
I need your help, 'kay?

23:29.408 --> 23:30.868
So, you were in the room
next to her.

23:30.910 --> 23:33.037
Is that right?
The day she left.

23:33.079 --> 23:35.289
She talked to me
through the wall.

23:35.331 --> 23:36.374
What'd she say?

23:36.415 --> 23:37.959
She said someone was coming.

23:38.000 --> 23:39.627
Then what?

23:39.669 --> 23:42.255
I heard her talk to this girl
through the door.

23:42.296 --> 23:44.423
The girl opened the doors
somehow.

23:44.465 --> 23:46.467
And then 249 went out.

23:46.509 --> 23:48.719
She said we were free.

23:48.761 --> 23:51.764
I didn't believe her.

23:53.975 --> 23:55.685
And so then what happened?

23:55.726 --> 23:57.436
Did she meet that girl alone?

23:57.478 --> 23:59.480
I don't know.

23:59.522 --> 24:01.649
There's no reason to lie, Sandy.

24:01.691 --> 24:03.067
Not to me.

24:03.109 --> 24:06.654
Did you go to the door and look?

24:10.449 --> 24:12.743
What happened
when you went to the door?

24:12.785 --> 24:13.744
What did you see?

24:13.786 --> 24:16.164
She showed her something.

24:16.205 --> 24:17.790
On the screen.

24:17.832 --> 24:18.958
What was it?

24:19.000 --> 24:20.710
I don't know.

24:20.751 --> 24:22.712
Yes, you do.

24:28.467 --> 24:31.929
It was something from her past.

24:31.971 --> 24:34.849
Her real past.

24:34.891 --> 24:36.893
What did she show her?

24:38.895 --> 24:41.647
She showed her
who her mother was, didn't she?

24:41.689 --> 24:43.399
SANDY:
I didn't tell

24:43.441 --> 24:45.151
any of the other trainees,
honestly.

24:45.193 --> 24:46.903
Oh, that's okay.
You're not in trouble.

24:46.944 --> 24:49.071
-I don't want
to leave the program.
-CARMICHAEL: It's okay.

24:49.113 --> 24:50.531
You did everything
we could have asked.

24:50.573 --> 24:52.742
Okay? Thanks. You can go now.

25:02.168 --> 25:03.794
ERIK:
Come on.

25:03.836 --> 25:05.296
Faster.

25:05.338 --> 25:06.797
Don't give up.

25:33.366 --> 25:35.076
You okay?

25:39.997 --> 25:42.959
Are we going to stay here
forever?

25:43.000 --> 25:45.544
It's safe here.
Don't you want to be safe?

25:45.586 --> 25:46.671
-Course I do.
-Maybe you don't.

25:46.712 --> 25:48.673
Maybe you want
to go back to that facility.

25:48.714 --> 25:51.592
-That facility
doesn't exist anymore.
-Then another facility.

25:51.634 --> 25:53.344
Is that what you want?

25:54.387 --> 25:55.888
No, of course not.

25:55.930 --> 25:58.641
Where they put drugs under
your skin to keep you sleepy.

25:58.683 --> 26:00.518
The same room every day.

26:00.559 --> 26:02.270
The same food,
the same exercises.

26:02.311 --> 26:04.563
-No air, no going outside.
-All right, I get it.

26:04.605 --> 26:06.482
No, you don't get it.
That thing in the sky,

26:06.524 --> 26:08.025
it wasn't after me,
it was after you.

26:08.067 --> 26:10.653
I'm protecting you.

26:10.695 --> 26:11.946
In the whole wide world,

26:11.988 --> 26:14.240
this is the only place
we are safe.

26:20.413 --> 26:22.164
LEO:
So there are 30 trainees.

26:22.206 --> 26:24.875
They'll be writing e-mails
and communicating online

26:24.917 --> 26:27.044
to a whole host of relatives
and friends

26:27.086 --> 26:31.007
as we build the backstory
for them and their families.

26:31.048 --> 26:33.551
Now, these stories need to
stack up for universities.

26:33.592 --> 26:35.928
Friends, lovers, uh,
anyone they might meet

26:35.970 --> 26:37.138
and show them to.

26:37.179 --> 26:39.348
You send mails, posts,

26:39.390 --> 26:41.309
reply to their
social media shout-outs.

26:41.350 --> 26:43.728
You chat with them
on all the online platforms.

26:43.769 --> 26:46.147
You can make requests for
visual support material

26:46.188 --> 26:47.773
through the Gemini data archive,

26:47.815 --> 26:49.734
which you can access
through your computer.

26:49.775 --> 26:51.152
Any questions?

26:51.193 --> 26:54.864
Okay, so you said
there are 30 different trainees.

26:54.905 --> 26:57.074
-Yeah.
-Each with maybe ten

26:57.116 --> 26:59.368
or-or 20 major correspondents

26:59.410 --> 27:02.371
and a hundred occasional
social media contacts.

27:02.413 --> 27:04.415
And they'll show them all
to each other,

27:04.457 --> 27:06.000
so each one has to be different.

27:07.543 --> 27:08.919
It's fun, huh?

27:11.714 --> 27:13.716
Food's available 24 hours a day.

27:13.758 --> 27:15.468
Entertainment consoles, TV,
it's all yours.

27:15.509 --> 27:16.927
But no contact
with the trainees,

27:16.969 --> 27:18.721
and from now on,
no phone calls home.

27:18.763 --> 27:21.223
Oh, I have a family who think
I'm working for an oil company.

27:21.265 --> 27:22.641
They'll expect to hear from me.

27:22.683 --> 27:24.894
I guess you were told
this was a Red Mark operation.

27:24.935 --> 27:27.521
Well, it is.

28:18.322 --> 28:20.366
I'm sorry.

28:20.408 --> 28:23.536
You saved me,
and I'm not grateful.

28:23.577 --> 28:25.871
It's okay.

28:30.459 --> 28:33.295
I just don't want to
be alone anymore.

28:35.423 --> 28:39.510
We're not alone.
We have each other.

29:06.704 --> 29:08.581
MARISSA:
Now Clara knows,

29:08.622 --> 29:10.541
she'll go looking
for her mother.

29:10.583 --> 29:12.001
She won't be able to resist it.

29:12.042 --> 29:14.003
And that's how you'll get her.

29:14.044 --> 29:15.754
CARMICHAEL:
She's Egyptian.

29:15.796 --> 29:17.006
Came to Romania
as an illegal immigrant.

29:17.047 --> 29:20.217
Met a Nigerian guy.
She got pregnant by accident.

29:20.259 --> 29:22.178
She decided to give up the baby.

29:22.219 --> 29:25.181
After she gave her baby
to Utrax, she disappeared.

29:25.222 --> 29:26.640
There's no record
of where she went.

29:26.682 --> 29:27.975
Nothing online.

29:28.017 --> 29:30.478
Samira Mahan may not even
be her real name.

29:30.519 --> 29:33.105
So if Clara does search
for her mother,

29:33.147 --> 29:34.773
there's nothing for her to find.

29:34.815 --> 29:39.111
Well, then I guess you better
make something up, John,

29:39.153 --> 29:41.655
because she will go looking.

29:41.697 --> 29:44.116
Stand by! Engage!

29:44.158 --> 29:45.493
Whoa!

29:45.534 --> 29:48.204
Engage!

29:48.245 --> 29:51.499
Whoa! Engage!

29:51.540 --> 29:52.583
Whoa!

29:59.173 --> 30:01.550
TERRI:
"Hi, Sandy.
Just posting to see

30:01.592 --> 30:03.594
"how you are finishing
high school.

30:03.636 --> 30:05.721
"It's sunny here, and we took
Jodie out for a walk.

30:05.763 --> 30:09.099
"She took a few steps herself,
isn't that cool?

30:09.141 --> 30:10.976
"I'll get a photo for you soon.

30:11.018 --> 30:15.105
Write when you can. Mom."

30:15.147 --> 30:16.899
-

30:16.941 --> 30:18.442
SANDY:
"Hi, Mom.

30:18.484 --> 30:21.237
"I'm having a great time
at the private school.

30:21.278 --> 30:23.280
"I'm glad I decided to move
to New York,

30:23.322 --> 30:25.157
"even though I miss you all.

30:25.199 --> 30:27.660
"I needed the space from Jodie
to focus on my studies

30:27.701 --> 30:30.329
"so I can get into
a good college.

30:30.371 --> 30:32.790
"Did I tell you I met a friend?

30:32.831 --> 30:35.626
"She's really nice.
Her name is Jules.

30:35.668 --> 30:39.296
"I'll send you a photo of her.
She has really cool hair.

30:39.338 --> 30:41.340
"Don't worry, I won't copy her.

30:41.382 --> 30:45.177
"The weather is good this fall.
Very sunny.

30:45.219 --> 30:47.346
"And we're playing
a lot of sports,

30:47.388 --> 30:49.348
"and I'm looking forward
to my music lessons.

30:49.390 --> 30:52.726
"Sometimes, of course,
I get lonely.

30:52.768 --> 30:55.980
"I miss you and Dad,
and I miss Jodie.

30:56.021 --> 30:59.858
"But not Brad, and you can
tell him that.

30:59.900 --> 31:01.443
"And I miss Montana, of course.

31:01.485 --> 31:03.571
"Give him a stroke for me.

31:03.612 --> 31:05.239
"Tell him I'll walk him
when I return,

31:05.281 --> 31:07.408
"after the semester ends.

31:07.449 --> 31:09.910
Hugs and kisses. Sandy."

31:44.695 --> 31:46.989
ERIK:
Hanna?

32:25.903 --> 32:27.946
ERIK:
Hanna!

32:30.157 --> 32:32.159
Clara?

32:38.874 --> 32:41.043
How did you get lost?

32:41.085 --> 32:44.672
I was with my mother.
I went the wrong way.

32:44.713 --> 32:47.341
You don't have a phone?

32:49.426 --> 32:51.595
DAUGHTER:
Are you American?

32:53.222 --> 32:55.599
Are you on holiday?

32:55.641 --> 32:57.685
Where are you staying?

32:57.726 --> 32:59.895
My mother's name is
Samira Mahan.

32:59.937 --> 33:01.939
I need to find her.

33:09.571 --> 33:11.782
With an "A."

33:15.703 --> 33:17.705
Is this her?

33:58.579 --> 34:01.248
MOTHER:
She's staying in a hotel
near Bucharest.

34:03.792 --> 34:05.586
I can take you there,
if you like.

34:57.054 --> 34:58.889
Have you been writing home?

34:58.931 --> 35:00.557
A little bit. You?

35:00.599 --> 35:02.935
Yeah, a lot.
To my mom, especially.

35:02.976 --> 35:04.561
She's lonely without me.

35:04.603 --> 35:07.439
My dad's in Iraq again,
and my sister's not well.

35:09.483 --> 35:11.401
-What?
-Nothing.

35:11.443 --> 35:14.947
Just... you know
it's not real, right?

35:14.988 --> 35:16.949
Why do you say that?

35:16.990 --> 35:18.992
Because it's not.

35:19.034 --> 35:21.453
Well, maybe it can be.

35:21.495 --> 35:23.455
What do you mean?

35:23.497 --> 35:25.040
Well, if they want us
to live in the world,

35:25.082 --> 35:27.334
then my family can't
just be writing letters, right?

35:27.376 --> 35:30.170
At some point,
I have to talk to them.

35:30.212 --> 35:32.297
Maybe meet 'em.

35:32.339 --> 35:33.924
How can you meet them?

35:33.966 --> 35:35.926
They have faces.

35:40.597 --> 35:44.142
You don't... get it, do you?

35:44.184 --> 35:47.354
They're just a story
to tell people.

35:47.396 --> 35:49.147
Nothing more.

35:49.189 --> 35:50.607
Listen, you do what
you want, okay.

35:50.649 --> 35:52.109
You don't have to write
to anyone.

35:52.150 --> 35:53.360
That's not what I meant.

35:53.402 --> 35:55.195
-Just leave me alone.
-Sandy...

36:05.664 --> 36:08.083
You want me to message her,
tell her you're coming?

36:08.125 --> 36:09.376
Yes, please.

36:09.418 --> 36:10.878
What should I say?

36:12.838 --> 36:14.423
Say her daughter wants
to see her.

36:17.134 --> 36:18.677
CARMICHAEL:
You were right.

36:18.719 --> 36:20.095
-She made contact.
-Where?

36:20.137 --> 36:22.222
In a forest south of
a village called Ulitze.

36:22.264 --> 36:25.601
She's heading to Bucharest now
with a Romanian family.

36:25.642 --> 36:27.603
Thinks her mother's
in the hotel.

36:27.644 --> 36:29.229
We're arranging the RV.

36:29.271 --> 36:31.231
-I need you there.
-MAN: Let's go.

36:31.273 --> 36:32.941
-MAN 2: Locked and loaded, sir.
-And what about Hanna?

36:32.983 --> 36:35.193
We're leaving Hanna alone,
just like you asked.

37:30.916 --> 37:32.876
SOLDIER:
Bravo Team on me,
going around back.

37:38.548 --> 37:40.550
Bravo Team in position.

37:49.768 --> 37:51.728
-Nobody here, sir.
-All right.

37:51.770 --> 37:53.355
Search the forest!

37:53.397 --> 37:55.399
-Sir!
-Sir!

38:00.237 --> 38:01.446
Ten meters!

38:06.201 --> 38:09.454
SANDY:
"Hi, Mom. I'm still happy
here at high school.

38:09.496 --> 38:11.623
"I've been made captain
of the hockey team.

38:11.665 --> 38:15.002
"But I'm angry with that friend
I told you about.

38:15.043 --> 38:17.462
"People can be so cruel.

38:17.504 --> 38:19.006
"I really gave her my trust,

38:19.047 --> 38:21.216
"but she doesn't
understand me at all.

38:21.258 --> 38:23.135
"I think it might be
because she doesn't have

38:23.176 --> 38:24.720
"such a close family.

38:24.761 --> 38:26.722
"Maybe she's jealous.

38:26.763 --> 38:30.475
Maybe she doesn't have the love
in her life that I do."

38:43.447 --> 38:46.033
DAUGHTER:
Hey, look, it's from your mom.

39:02.632 --> 39:04.593
How long until we get there?

39:04.634 --> 39:06.636
Two hours.

39:22.069 --> 39:24.946
SOLDIER:
Group Lima headed
north-northwest.

39:24.988 --> 39:26.990
No eyeball.

39:31.119 --> 39:33.538
I just saw something.

39:40.504 --> 39:43.757
Target contact!
Fall back to the cabin!

39:43.799 --> 39:45.092
Engage!

40:24.756 --> 40:27.717
-Thank you.
-You want someone
to come with you?

40:27.759 --> 40:30.178
No, I'll be fine. Thank you.

40:58.206 --> 40:59.374
Can I help you?

40:59.416 --> 41:01.751
My mother is in Room 427.

41:01.793 --> 41:03.211
You okay?

41:04.671 --> 41:06.381
Uh, what's her name?

41:06.423 --> 41:08.425
Samira Mahan.

41:08.466 --> 41:10.886
-"Mahan."
-

41:10.927 --> 41:12.137
Okay. Would you like me
to call her?

41:12.179 --> 41:13.597
No, she knows I'm coming.

41:13.638 --> 41:15.432
Okay, it's, uh, second floor,
over there.

41:35.911 --> 41:38.330
Mom?

41:40.332 --> 41:41.917
Mom, it's me.

41:43.960 --> 41:45.962
Mom?

41:51.218 --> 41:52.719
Sit down, Clara.

41:52.761 --> 41:54.137
I need to talk to you.

41:54.179 --> 41:56.556
Where's my mother?

41:56.598 --> 42:00.185
I need to explain what's
happening. Please sit down.

42:00.227 --> 42:01.853
Where is my mother?

42:01.895 --> 42:03.855
She's not here.

42:03.897 --> 42:06.024
Stay calm.

42:06.066 --> 42:08.485
Let me tell you what happened.

42:10.695 --> 42:13.114
Your mother chose to give
you up after you were born.

42:13.156 --> 42:14.866
And then, I'm afraid, she died.

42:14.908 --> 42:17.452
That's why you're with us.

42:17.494 --> 42:19.829
And why we're so keen
to look after you now.

42:19.871 --> 42:22.540
No.

42:22.582 --> 42:24.376
It's okay.

42:24.417 --> 42:29.214
It's not gonna be like it was
before, in the facility.

42:29.256 --> 42:33.260
I want to show you what it's
going to be like from now on.

42:40.558 --> 42:43.520
We're going to give you
a new life.

42:43.561 --> 42:45.146
Your name is Clemency.

42:45.188 --> 42:47.649
You're 18, you're in school.

42:47.691 --> 42:49.859
You live with a big family

42:49.901 --> 42:53.488
in a beautiful house
in Oakland, California.

42:53.530 --> 42:55.490
Your father
is in local government.

42:55.532 --> 42:59.703
Your mother, here,
she's a teacher.

42:59.744 --> 43:02.998
We can make all this
happen for you.

43:03.039 --> 43:05.166
And I promise
we're gonna give you

43:05.208 --> 43:06.835
-all the love you need.
-I don't want that.

43:06.876 --> 43:08.628
I want her.

43:10.505 --> 43:13.133
I know, but she's gone.

43:22.517 --> 43:24.728
Don't run away from me.

43:27.522 --> 43:29.941
Move in.

43:29.983 --> 43:31.776
SOLDIER:
Copy that.

43:40.618 --> 43:42.370
Down! On the ground!

43:44.164 --> 43:46.666
:
No! Let me go!

43:46.708 --> 43:48.835
No! No! Let me go!

43:48.877 --> 43:51.129
Let me go! No!

43:51.171 --> 43:53.131
:
Get off me!

43:53.173 --> 43:55.175
Let me go!

44:06.478 --> 44:09.939
You know there's still a place
for you with us if you want.

44:09.981 --> 44:12.233
-You'd trust me with that?
-Well, not everyone can deal

44:12.275 --> 44:13.401
with this kind of work.

44:13.443 --> 44:14.986
You've shown you can.

44:15.028 --> 44:18.823
You didn't leave Hanna
in the forest, did you?

44:20.283 --> 44:22.243
I know you, John.

44:22.285 --> 44:24.287
Just tell me the truth.

44:26.373 --> 44:28.625
We found the cabin
in the forest.

44:28.666 --> 44:31.044
There was, uh,
a fight of some kind.

44:31.086 --> 44:33.505
A gas explosion in the cabin.

44:34.672 --> 44:36.257
And Hanna?

44:36.299 --> 44:38.968
She was inside.

44:43.765 --> 44:45.642
Marissa, I assure you,

44:45.683 --> 44:48.520
-we never had any intention...
-Just... just get out.

44:58.154 --> 45:00.198
The offer remains open.

46:01.384 --> 46:04.012
HANNA:
Where did you take her?

46:15.899 --> 46:19.194
VIRTUAL TEACHER:
Welcome, Sandy, to your
virtual piano lesson.

46:19.235 --> 46:22.071
Let's start by hitting a key.

46:22.113 --> 46:24.616
Try this one.

47:17.377 --> 47:19.921
and I don't believe it

47:22.131 --> 47:24.342
hate propaganda

47:26.678 --> 47:28.805
into your darkness

47:31.015 --> 47:33.184
to your hatred

47:35.645 --> 47:37.939
no, no, no, no

47:37.981 --> 47:40.066
no, no, no, no, no

47:40.108 --> 47:42.068
no, no, no, no

47:44.404 --> 47:46.656
I am electric

47:48.741 --> 47:50.952
for your destiny, no

47:53.162 --> 47:55.248
to children

47:55.290 --> 47:57.375
forced to run

47:57.417 --> 47:59.794
I'm not a minion

48:02.130 --> 48:04.507
no, no, no, no

48:04.549 --> 48:06.467
no, no, no, no, no

48:06.509 --> 48:08.720
no, no, no, no

48:56.225 --> 48:58.853
no, no, no, no

48:58.895 --> 49:00.855
no, no, no, no, no
