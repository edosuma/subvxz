¶ ¶

00:34.368 --> 00:36.735
¶ ¶

00:51.352 --> 00:53.152
I didn't think
you were coming.

00:53.154 --> 00:55.387
I had to wait for the
night watch to pass.

00:55.389 --> 00:57.556
What's up?

00:57.558 --> 00:59.625
I don't want to
be here any more.

00:59.627 --> 01:01.794
Why?

01:01.796 --> 01:04.663
Don't leave now;
we only have six weeks left.

01:04.665 --> 01:06.698
Think about it,
no more drills,

01:06.700 --> 01:11.236
Uniforms, mess hall
food until September.

01:11.238 --> 01:14.640
I'm leaving tomorrow
and I'm not coming back.

01:14.642 --> 01:16.809
I don't belong here.

01:24.718 --> 01:26.718
If somebody's out there,
you better high-tail it

01:26.720 --> 01:28.620
Back inside here asap,

01:28.622 --> 01:30.089
Or I'm locking you out.

01:34.295 --> 01:36.128
(kicks paper doorstop away)

01:38.699 --> 01:40.766
(choking)

01:42.670 --> 01:43.802
(grunts)

01:51.312 --> 01:52.311
What is this?

01:52.313 --> 01:53.412
I don't know.

01:53.414 --> 01:54.713
Maybe it's some
kind of drill?

01:54.715 --> 01:56.682
Let's get out of here.

01:56.684 --> 01:59.151
(with accent):
You'll wake the others.

02:00.387 --> 02:01.687
Stop!

02:01.689 --> 02:03.222
Run, right now, go!

02:09.797 --> 02:11.196
(grunts)

02:26.914 --> 02:29.181
(muffled grunting)

02:35.156 --> 02:36.488
What the hell's
going on, hanna?

02:36.490 --> 02:37.556
Shh!

02:46.800 --> 02:48.867
¶ ¶

03:07.288 --> 03:08.353
(phone blipping)

03:28.742 --> 03:30.442
Granger:
<i> Your return verified</i>

03:30.444 --> 03:32.477
The authenticity of
the threat, as we speak.

03:32.479 --> 03:34.446
Now would it be possible
to send a couple field agents

03:34.448 --> 03:35.814
Out there to take a look?

03:37.251 --> 03:38.784
Okay, I appreciate that.

03:38.786 --> 03:40.452
Yeah.

03:40.454 --> 03:42.854
I'll get back to you
when I have more details.

03:42.856 --> 03:43.722
Kensi:
What's going on?

03:43.724 --> 03:44.856
Well, it's possible

03:44.858 --> 03:46.792
The keating military
academy has been

03:46.794 --> 03:48.727
Taken over by some sort
of extremist group.

03:48.729 --> 03:50.429
Wait, sam's son, aiden,
attends that school.

03:50.431 --> 03:52.464
Which is the only reason
we know about it.

03:53.867 --> 03:55.567
Where are we?

03:55.569 --> 03:57.536
Haven't heard anything
else from aiden.

03:57.538 --> 03:59.171
Kensi:
You try calling him?

03:59.172 --> 04:00.805
The academy has a strict
no cell phone policy.

04:00.808 --> 04:03.775
He has a tablet, but he hasn't
answered my e-mails or texts.

04:03.777 --> 04:05.844
Is there any chance this
is some sort of surprise

04:05.846 --> 04:07.813
Academy training exercise?

04:07.815 --> 04:11.717
He sent a distress code
only he knows.

04:11.719 --> 04:13.169
This is no exercise.

04:13.170 --> 04:14.620
Calls to the school are
going straight to voicemail.

04:14.622 --> 04:15.921
Check this out.

04:15.923 --> 04:17.022
According to the
academy web site,

04:17.024 --> 04:18.357
They're experiencing
electrical

04:18.359 --> 04:19.575
And communications problems

04:19.576 --> 04:20.792
That they say they'll
have sorted out

04:20.794 --> 04:21.893
In the next few hours.

04:21.895 --> 04:22.894
Is that legit?

04:22.896 --> 04:24.313
I don't think so.

04:24.314 --> 04:25.731
I just checked with
california edison

04:25.733 --> 04:26.932
And local phone companies.

04:26.934 --> 04:28.350
Nobody has anyone up there.

04:28.351 --> 04:29.767
Could be someone's way
of buying more time,

04:29.770 --> 04:31.637
Preventing anyone
from looking into it.

04:31.639 --> 04:33.438
Why don't we just have local
law enforcement swing by,

04:33.440 --> 04:34.439
See what's going on?

04:34.441 --> 04:35.507
I already called the fbi

04:35.509 --> 04:36.875
Field office in san francisco

04:36.877 --> 04:38.343
To send a couple agents out.

04:38.345 --> 04:39.911
No, call them back.

04:39.913 --> 04:41.191
Why?

04:41.192 --> 04:42.470
Because if this is legit...
It is!

04:42.471 --> 04:43.749
...And we have to
assume that it is,

04:43.751 --> 04:44.883
Then whoever is behind it,

04:44.885 --> 04:46.318
They don't know that
we're on to them.

04:46.320 --> 04:47.386
We need to keep
it that way

04:47.387 --> 04:48.453
For as long as we can,
or at least

04:48.455 --> 04:49.638
Until we know what
we're up against.

04:49.639 --> 04:50.822
I'll tell you what
they're up against.

04:50.824 --> 04:51.923
They're up against me.

04:51.925 --> 04:53.659
Call off the feds.

04:56.797 --> 04:58.363
Granger: What do you think
you're gonna do?

04:58.365 --> 04:59.481
I'm going to make sure
my son is safe.

04:59.482 --> 05:00.598
And how do you
propose to do that?

05:00.601 --> 05:01.800
I'm going there.
<i>We're</i> going there.

05:01.802 --> 05:03.302
We're gonna take
these guys out.

05:03.304 --> 05:04.703
We could be
there in an hour.

05:04.705 --> 05:06.505
Granger: The fbi could have
people there in minutes.

05:06.507 --> 05:08.740
Not without tipping
off those inside.

05:08.742 --> 05:09.841
We're talking
about federal agents,

05:09.843 --> 05:11.610
Not some backwoods
deputy sheriff.

05:11.612 --> 05:13.912
And what happens if this goes
wrong while you're in the air?

05:13.914 --> 05:16.381
At least we have boots on
the ground within an hour.

05:16.383 --> 05:17.916
Killing me.

05:18.886 --> 05:20.886
Where'd you come from?

05:20.888 --> 05:24.890
Oh, I'm everywhere
these days, mr. Callen.

05:24.892 --> 05:27.392
You should know that by now.

05:31.598 --> 05:32.898
My son's in there, hetty.

05:32.900 --> 05:35.634
Along with the sons and
daughters of many other

05:35.636 --> 05:38.370
Rich and important
families, mr. Hanna.

05:38.372 --> 05:39.905
All the more reason
you need us in there.

05:39.907 --> 05:41.573
This is a job for
the react team.

05:41.575 --> 05:44.810
No, this is a job
for the seals, which I am.

05:44.812 --> 05:47.546
I attended keating academy,
as did my father before me.

05:47.548 --> 05:49.381
I know that place like
the back of my hand,

05:49.383 --> 05:51.750
And I'm the only one in contact
with someone on the inside.

05:51.752 --> 05:53.085
You know what?
Call in the react team,

05:53.087 --> 05:54.820
But in the meantime,
the clock is ticking.

05:54.822 --> 05:56.605
We need to go in there now,
while it's dark,

05:56.606 --> 05:58.389
While whoever is in there
is still getting settled.

05:58.392 --> 06:00.425
Okay, this goes south,
you two...
Kensi: Four.

06:00.427 --> 06:02.027
We're a team.

06:02.029 --> 06:04.129
Team or no team, even if
you go in unofficially,

06:04.131 --> 06:06.365
This goes wrong, we're all done.

06:06.367 --> 06:08.100
I don't care about ncis.

06:08.102 --> 06:09.768
I don't care about my career.

06:09.770 --> 06:12.003
All I care about

06:12.005 --> 06:15.674
Is keeping my son and everybody
else in that school safe.

06:15.676 --> 06:18.477
I understand that,
and you have my sympathy,

06:18.479 --> 06:20.846
But you cannot turn this into
a personal rescue operation.

06:20.848 --> 06:21.947
(phone blips)

06:24.685 --> 06:27.052
It's a text from aiden.

06:27.054 --> 06:28.420
It's a video clip.

06:28.422 --> 06:29.855
I'm gonna put it up.

06:29.857 --> 06:31.923
Move. Keeping moving.

06:31.925 --> 06:33.425
No talking.

06:33.427 --> 06:35.160
That's tahir khaled.

06:36.130 --> 06:38.997
Is that personal enough for you?

06:48.876 --> 06:50.942
(beeping)

06:51.779 --> 06:54.846
Man:
You! Down there! Sit!

06:54.848 --> 06:55.981
Keep moving!

06:55.983 --> 06:57.516
Keep quiet!

06:59.052 --> 07:01.052
Male cadet: It's okay,
just comply with them.

07:01.054 --> 07:02.521
Over here. Over here.

07:02.523 --> 07:04.189
Sit down.
It's gonna be okay.

07:04.191 --> 07:05.857
All right, just get down.
Listen...

07:12.966 --> 07:14.533
We lost our wifi signal.

07:14.535 --> 07:15.734
Maybe they turned it off.

07:17.471 --> 07:18.937
We need a phone.

07:18.939 --> 07:20.472
I'm gonna try to get to
the instructor's lounge.

07:20.474 --> 07:21.606
I'm not staying here alone.

07:21.608 --> 07:22.808
I'm coming with you.

07:22.810 --> 07:24.476
Okay.

07:34.688 --> 07:37.656
Everyone has been secured
in the rec hall.

07:37.658 --> 07:39.024
And aiden hanna?

07:39.026 --> 07:40.826
We're still
searching for him.

07:40.828 --> 07:43.795
What about the girl
who got away from you?

07:48.235 --> 07:50.735
So, everyone is not secured?

07:50.737 --> 07:52.103
We will find them.

07:52.105 --> 07:54.673
Not standing in here.

07:58.078 --> 08:00.812
Sam:
<i> If tahir's smart,</i>

08:00.814 --> 08:02.481
He'll round up all
the students and staff

08:02.483 --> 08:04.616
And secure them
in one location,

08:04.618 --> 08:07.185
Probably the gym
or the cafeteria.

08:07.187 --> 08:09.120
What are the chances we'll
be dealing with explosives

08:09.122 --> 08:10.655
Or guys in suicide vests?

08:10.657 --> 08:12.157
I wouldn't put
anything by tahir.

08:12.159 --> 08:13.191
Okay, there's gonna be
a helicopter

08:13.193 --> 08:15.160
Waiting for us
on the tarmac.

08:15.162 --> 08:17.262
We will ride in from an
insertion point here.

08:17.264 --> 08:18.763
Ride?

08:18.765 --> 08:20.232
Mountain bikes.

08:20.233 --> 08:21.700
The chopper's gonna drop
us five miles northwest

08:21.702 --> 08:23.568
Of the school to avoid
any suspicion.

08:23.570 --> 08:25.003
What are we looking
at for backup?

08:25.005 --> 08:26.872
Granger's putting together
a react team.

08:26.874 --> 08:28.757
Sam:
Look...

08:28.758 --> 08:30.641
I don't want local law
enforcement involved

08:30.644 --> 08:32.110
Until we know what
we're up against

08:32.112 --> 08:34.679
Or we run the risk of tahir
picking up the radio chatter.

08:34.681 --> 08:36.781
We've got one shot
at doing this clean.

08:36.783 --> 08:38.950
If we lose the element of
surprise, this could very easily

08:38.952 --> 08:41.019
Turn into a stand-off, and
that is the last thing we want.

08:41.021 --> 08:42.654
I don't mean
to be a pessimist, but...

08:42.656 --> 08:44.222
What if it does?

08:44.224 --> 08:45.657
Then we make sure it doesn't.

08:50.597 --> 08:52.063
Stay cool.

09:05.212 --> 09:07.612
You want to
say something?

09:07.614 --> 09:09.814
I haven't heard you
mention michelle.

09:12.119 --> 09:16.021
She and kamran are
helping out her mother

09:16.023 --> 09:17.222
Following hip surgery.

09:17.224 --> 09:18.590
Her mom doesn't have a phone?

09:18.591 --> 09:19.957
I just want to stay
focused on the mission.

09:19.960 --> 09:22.127
This mission involves
rescuing her son.

09:22.129 --> 09:25.196
If I tell her aiden's
in a hostage situation,

09:25.198 --> 09:26.598
What do you think
she's gonna do?

09:26.600 --> 09:28.567
I think she's gonna
be worried sick,

09:28.569 --> 09:30.635
But she still needs
to know what's happening.

09:30.637 --> 09:33.138
She's gonna jump on a plane
and try to help.

09:33.140 --> 09:35.307
No, check that,
she's gonna insist on helping,

09:35.309 --> 09:37.909
And by helping, I mean
she's gonna go in there

09:37.911 --> 09:40.245
Like a fully strapped
mama bear that makes

09:40.247 --> 09:41.980
The punisher look
like mother theresa.

09:41.982 --> 09:43.782
We could use a secret weapon.

09:43.784 --> 09:45.684
(sighs)

09:46.887 --> 09:49.821
Think I should have left
my family in protective custody?

09:49.823 --> 09:51.923
I think you still
need to call your wife.

09:52.893 --> 09:55.360
I will.

09:55.362 --> 09:56.962
When it's over.

09:59.099 --> 10:01.266
After our son is safe.

10:16.083 --> 10:17.649
It's dead, we need
to find a cell phone.

10:17.651 --> 10:19.017
The night watch.

10:19.019 --> 10:20.385
They killed him, but he
may still have his phone.

10:20.387 --> 10:21.686
Okay.

10:30.998 --> 10:32.364
Where is aiden hanna?

10:32.366 --> 10:33.999
I don't know who that is.

10:34.835 --> 10:36.034
(grunts)

10:36.036 --> 10:37.369
I know you're
his teacher.

10:39.906 --> 10:41.172
Where...

10:41.174 --> 10:43.842
Is aiden hanna?

10:43.844 --> 10:46.044
He's not here.

10:49.049 --> 10:50.415
(grunts)

10:50.417 --> 10:52.684
(coughs, gasps)

10:57.257 --> 11:01.326
He was sent home,
for disciplinary reasons.

11:08.869 --> 11:10.301
If you don't tell
me where he is,

11:10.303 --> 11:12.370
I will shoot you.

11:17.377 --> 11:19.310
On second thought...

11:21.048 --> 11:25.083
I will shoot one
of your students...

11:25.085 --> 11:27.218
Every minute...

11:27.220 --> 11:29.354
Until you...

11:29.356 --> 11:31.089
Bring aiden hanna...

11:31.091 --> 11:32.757
To me.

11:34.194 --> 11:35.427
Granger:
<i> We need a contingency plan.</i>

11:38.765 --> 11:41.700
We need a bloody miracle.

11:41.702 --> 11:43.068
We've activated every agent

11:43.070 --> 11:45.003
With react training
on the west coast.

11:45.005 --> 11:48.339
Well... We have to alert secnav.

11:48.341 --> 11:51.342
You know I'm right
about this one, owen.

11:51.344 --> 11:55.046
We're damned if we do
and damned if we don't.

11:56.383 --> 11:59.117
I'll make the call once
our team is on the ground.

11:59.119 --> 12:01.386
And what are you going
to say when they ask us

12:01.388 --> 12:03.739
Why we took so long?

12:03.740 --> 12:06.091
We wanted to make certain
it wasn't a hoax.

12:06.093 --> 12:08.159
That's weak.

12:08.161 --> 12:09.327
Well...

12:09.329 --> 12:10.895
(sighs)

12:10.897 --> 12:12.464
...Let's hope our team isn't.

12:29.883 --> 12:31.850
Deeks:
They got no roving patrols.

12:33.820 --> 12:34.986
They don't need them
if they're monitoring

12:34.988 --> 12:36.488
The school's security system.

12:36.490 --> 12:37.489
Eric...

12:37.491 --> 12:38.490
Callen.

12:38.492 --> 12:39.491
Eric, do you have access

12:39.493 --> 12:40.825
To the school's security system?

12:40.827 --> 12:42.527
No, it's a closed system.

12:42.529 --> 12:45.296
You'd have to patch me in,
but I'll be blind if anyone

12:45.298 --> 12:46.498
Cuts the power.

12:46.500 --> 12:48.133
It might be better
setting up our own.

12:48.135 --> 12:50.101
All right, guys,
ready when you are.

12:51.104 --> 12:52.403
Deeks, get us online.

12:52.405 --> 12:53.772
On it.

12:55.142 --> 12:56.541
Cover us, kens.

12:56.543 --> 12:57.509
I got your back.

13:05.886 --> 13:08.953
All right, nell...

13:08.955 --> 13:10.922
I'm setting up the sat.

13:10.924 --> 13:12.390
Let me know when you got it.

13:12.392 --> 13:13.792
Will do.

13:30.310 --> 13:31.810
(electronic blip)

13:36.283 --> 13:37.582
(electrical hiss)

13:56.603 --> 13:58.837
Inside, move!

14:03.510 --> 14:05.043
Where is aiden hanna?

14:08.315 --> 14:09.881
(cocks gun)

14:09.883 --> 14:12.083
No, please, don't.

14:12.085 --> 14:13.184
What is it you want?

14:13.186 --> 14:16.521
I want aiden hanna.

14:19.025 --> 14:21.059
(gunshot)

14:22.162 --> 14:23.161
That was gunfire.

14:23.163 --> 14:24.562
Sam, callen, you guys okay?

14:24.564 --> 14:27.265
Yeah, it came from inside.

14:29.336 --> 14:31.402
Maybe it was just
a warning shot.

14:46.119 --> 14:48.286
Tahir:
Leave her alone.

14:48.288 --> 14:49.621
She needs a doctor.

14:49.623 --> 14:52.056
(thud)

14:52.058 --> 14:56.060
She's not going to live long
enough to worry about that.

14:56.062 --> 14:57.996
None of you are.

14:57.998 --> 14:59.931
Any more gunfire?

14:59.933 --> 15:01.399
No, just the one shot.

15:01.401 --> 15:03.635
Any communication in
or out of the academy?

15:03.637 --> 15:06.037
Nothing. They're maintaining
radio silence.

15:06.039 --> 15:06.938
Damn it.

15:06.940 --> 15:08.072
What's wrong, sir?

15:08.074 --> 15:10.108
They haven't issued any demands.

15:10.110 --> 15:11.626
Was that bad?

15:11.627 --> 15:13.143
Well, yeah, it means
we don't know what they want.

15:13.146 --> 15:15.346
If they're not using the
hostages as bargaining chips,

15:15.348 --> 15:16.981
What the hell are
they gonna do with them?

15:18.051 --> 15:19.617
Let me know the minute
our team's inside,

15:19.619 --> 15:22.253
And I need an encrypted
line from my office

15:22.255 --> 15:23.321
To the secnav, beale.

15:23.323 --> 15:24.622
Aye, aye, sir.

15:29.562 --> 15:31.229
You okay?

15:32.198 --> 15:35.333
Yeah, I'm just...
Worried for sam.

15:35.335 --> 15:36.935
It's gonna be okay.

15:36.937 --> 15:38.536
Yeah, how do you know?

15:38.538 --> 15:40.538
Because it has to be.

15:40.540 --> 15:42.073
Deeks:
You getting this signal?

15:42.075 --> 15:44.275
(computer beeps)
yup, I see it.

15:44.277 --> 15:45.310
It's a good, strong signal.

15:45.312 --> 15:47.078
(steady beeping)

15:47.080 --> 15:48.713
All right, I'm going to earwigs.

15:48.715 --> 15:49.714
Kens.

15:49.716 --> 15:52.150
Yup.

15:55.055 --> 15:56.321
Moving.

16:01.127 --> 16:02.193
Anything?

16:03.530 --> 16:05.663
It's just freaky quiet out here.

16:05.665 --> 16:08.066
(electronic blipping, clicking)

16:12.472 --> 16:13.504
Deeks:
Sam, callen,

16:13.506 --> 16:15.206
You guys inside?

16:15.208 --> 16:16.507
No.

16:17.510 --> 16:19.177
This door's wired.

16:19.179 --> 16:20.678
We need a bomb squad out here.

16:20.680 --> 16:23.114
I doubt they had
the time or the ordnance

16:23.116 --> 16:24.615
To booby trap all the doors.

16:24.617 --> 16:28.119
It's still gonna slow us down,
if we have to check every one.

16:41.301 --> 16:43.601
(muffled sobbing)

16:51.544 --> 16:54.245
Provisions.

16:54.247 --> 16:56.214
Oh, wow, I didn't
think we were allowed

16:56.216 --> 16:57.715
To have food or
drink in here.

16:57.717 --> 17:00.001
Me neither.
You're not,

17:00.002 --> 17:02.286
But it's late and I need
you both up to speed.

17:02.288 --> 17:03.354
Thank you, hetty.

17:03.356 --> 17:05.256
Yeah, I could get used to this.

17:05.258 --> 17:07.191
Don't.

17:07.193 --> 17:08.493
(clears throat)
but, of course, I won't.

17:09.562 --> 17:12.163
Secnav's been informed
of the situation.

17:12.165 --> 17:14.182
And?

17:14.183 --> 17:16.200
She insists on access
to our live feeds.

17:16.202 --> 17:17.268
Oh, you want me to patch in

17:17.270 --> 17:18.753
The secnav?

17:18.754 --> 17:20.237
I want you to try
to patch in the secnav,

17:20.240 --> 17:21.606
But I expect you to run
into technical difficulties.

17:21.608 --> 17:22.640
Oh,

17:22.642 --> 17:24.242
It's really not that difficult.

17:24.244 --> 17:26.377
But... It<i> could</i> be.

17:28.548 --> 17:30.114
But it could be.

17:30.116 --> 17:33.251
Yes, it could be, it could be,
uh, very difficult.

17:33.253 --> 17:34.552
Actually, darn near impossible.

17:34.554 --> 17:36.337
Good.

17:36.338 --> 17:38.121
How much time
do you think they have?

17:38.124 --> 17:40.425
Well, phone calls are being
made as we speak.

17:42.328 --> 17:44.395
There are kids of some
very influential players

17:44.397 --> 17:46.531
In that school.

17:46.533 --> 17:47.732
This is gonna degrade

17:47.734 --> 17:49.400
Into a jurisdictional
nightmare.

17:49.402 --> 17:51.702
Dod is also gonna
insist on informing

17:51.704 --> 17:53.204
Some of those parents.

17:53.206 --> 17:55.807
When that happens,
this will be a media circus.

17:55.809 --> 17:57.675
Hetty:
You hearing that, everyone?

17:57.677 --> 17:59.377
Yeah, loud and clear.

17:59.379 --> 18:01.179
Granger: I figure you got
20 minutes, tops,

18:01.181 --> 18:02.580
Till you get company.

18:11.324 --> 18:12.623
We're in.

18:12.625 --> 18:14.425
Kensi, deeks, there's
a dorm room window open

18:14.427 --> 18:17.829
On the first floor, three down
from the southwest corner.

18:17.831 --> 18:20.431
We'll put a camera in the
hallway, keep an eye on it.

18:24.537 --> 18:26.771
This is aiden's room.

18:26.773 --> 18:28.706
It's not a coincidence.

18:28.707 --> 18:30.640
I knew I could count on him
to leave his window open for us.

18:35.448 --> 18:36.514
(electronic blip)

18:50.430 --> 18:52.530
Looks clear.

19:03.643 --> 19:06.344
Eyes are going up.

19:13.887 --> 19:15.786
We got you.

19:26.266 --> 19:27.431
Does he have his phone?

19:27.433 --> 19:28.432
No.

19:28.434 --> 19:29.433
They must have taken it.

19:29.435 --> 19:30.952
(p.A. System feedback whines)

19:30.953 --> 19:32.470
Tahir (over p.A.):
Attention, aiden hanna.

19:32.472 --> 19:34.739
The gunfire you heard
was the sound

19:34.741 --> 19:36.707
Of one of your
teachers being shot.

19:36.709 --> 19:39.510
Say something, lieutenant james.

19:39.946 --> 19:41.913
(screams)

19:43.616 --> 19:44.682
(over p.A.):
Now, the next bullet

19:44.684 --> 19:47.185
Will be in her head

19:47.187 --> 19:49.487
If you do not show yourself.

19:49.489 --> 19:51.856
And after she is dead,

19:51.857 --> 19:54.224
I will start shooting
your fellow cadets.

19:54.227 --> 19:56.460
Aiden's not gonna
let that happen.

19:57.931 --> 20:01.799
We have to get to him before
he turns himself in to tahir.

20:01.801 --> 20:03.534
Eric, we got wifi yet?

20:03.536 --> 20:06.270
Yeah, it shows up as
the "greenhouse printer."

20:06.272 --> 20:08.372
Keating academy doesn't
have a greenhouse.

20:08.374 --> 20:09.429
Aiden will know that.

20:09.430 --> 20:10.485
Hopefully tahir
and his men won't,

20:10.486 --> 20:11.541
And there's no
passcode necessary.

20:11.544 --> 20:12.543
Anything from aiden?

20:12.545 --> 20:14.278
Sam:
Nothing.

20:16.783 --> 20:17.548
Here.

20:17.550 --> 20:20.484
Wait a minute or two
until after I'm gone,

20:20.486 --> 20:22.420
Then try to make it to one
of the other buildings.

20:22.422 --> 20:24.222
They may still have
a wifi signal.

20:24.224 --> 20:25.223
What are you gonna do?

20:25.225 --> 20:26.791
Turn myself in.

20:26.793 --> 20:28.859
You can't.

20:28.861 --> 20:30.962
I don't have a choice.

20:30.964 --> 20:32.496
I'm gonna try to go
the long way around

20:32.498 --> 20:33.898
To draw away some of the guards.

20:33.900 --> 20:34.932
When you get a signal,
text my dad.

20:34.934 --> 20:36.000
He knows we're in trouble.

20:55.555 --> 20:57.722
(whispering):
Two unfriendlies.

20:57.724 --> 20:59.323
No way to sneak
up on them.

20:59.325 --> 21:00.725
We may have to
lure them back here.

21:00.727 --> 21:02.893
Safer to go around.

21:05.498 --> 21:07.632
Still nothing from aiden.

21:07.634 --> 21:10.601
If tahir's talking
on the p.A. System,

21:10.603 --> 21:12.637
He's gotta be
in the main office.

21:14.407 --> 21:15.539
That's where aiden is headed.

21:15.541 --> 21:18.576
Eric, can you find
aiden's tablet?

21:18.578 --> 21:20.678
Eric:
If he's got the find
function activated.

21:20.680 --> 21:22.980
(electronic blipping)
we got him.

21:22.982 --> 21:24.749
Callen:
Where is he?

21:24.750 --> 21:26.517
He's headed in the
opposite direction you are.

21:26.519 --> 21:29.053
Nell:
It appears he's looking
for a way out.

21:29.055 --> 21:30.588
No way, not aiden.

21:30.590 --> 21:31.589
He's scared.

21:31.591 --> 21:33.491
Of course  he's scared...

21:33.493 --> 21:35.559
But I know my son.

21:35.561 --> 21:36.927
No way he'll run.

21:36.929 --> 21:37.928
He doesn't know we're here.

21:37.930 --> 21:39.063
He could be looking for help.

21:39.065 --> 21:40.965
He knows I'll be coming.

21:44.003 --> 21:45.670
It's your call.

21:45.672 --> 21:46.904
Office or tablet?

21:46.906 --> 21:49.373
Office.

21:49.375 --> 21:50.741
Kensi and deeks,
follow the tablet.

21:50.743 --> 21:51.809
Kensi:
Copy that.

22:08.995 --> 22:10.928
We've been expecting you.

22:23.676 --> 22:25.776
(whispering):
One.

22:27.847 --> 22:29.914
(choking)

23:00.580 --> 23:03.881
Kensi:
Callen, sam, have you guys
found aiden yet?

23:03.883 --> 23:05.416
Aiden's not here.

23:05.418 --> 23:06.951
Nobody is, but there's
a pool of blood.

23:06.953 --> 23:08.386
We think it might
be the teacher's.

23:08.388 --> 23:10.821
Sam:
Eric, you still tracking
aiden's tablet?

23:10.823 --> 23:12.490
Yeah, yeah, he's still
in the building.

23:12.492 --> 23:14.759
We should have a visual
any second, as he passes

23:14.761 --> 23:16.127
One of the
cameras you placed.

23:16.129 --> 23:18.462
Secnav's on the encrypted line.

23:18.464 --> 23:20.431
All right, I'll take care of it.

23:20.433 --> 23:21.832
What are you gonna say to her?

23:23.069 --> 23:24.869
That you've gone rogue.

23:25.905 --> 23:27.438
Just kidding.

23:27.440 --> 23:29.106
If it all goes bad,

23:29.108 --> 23:31.976
I'll fake a stroke.

23:31.978 --> 23:33.110
Guys...

23:33.112 --> 23:35.112
That's not aiden.

23:35.114 --> 23:36.180
Someone else must
have his tablet.

23:36.182 --> 23:37.982
It's a female cadet.

23:37.984 --> 23:40.418
Aiden must have
given it to her.

23:40.420 --> 23:41.685
Why would he do that?

23:41.687 --> 23:42.686
So she could go

23:42.688 --> 23:44.054
Get help...

23:44.056 --> 23:46.991
While he does something
very brave and very stupid.

23:46.993 --> 23:49.760
Like father, like son.

23:49.762 --> 23:52.430
Unfortunately, she's not
gonna have it for very long.

23:52.432 --> 23:54.131
One of tahir's men
is closing in on her.

23:54.133 --> 23:55.499
Which way, eric?

23:55.501 --> 23:56.734
Eric:
All right, uh, head north,

23:56.736 --> 23:58.169
Take your first right.

23:59.739 --> 24:01.906
Maybe I should have gone
to the military academy.

24:01.908 --> 24:03.073
Yeah, I don't see
that happening.

24:03.075 --> 24:04.642
We had a name
for guys like you

24:04.644 --> 24:05.776
In military school, deeks.

24:05.778 --> 24:07.077
What's that, dropouts?

24:07.079 --> 24:08.078
Wow.

24:08.080 --> 24:09.747
You boys obviously didn't

24:09.749 --> 24:11.081
Get the memo from hetty
on bullying.

24:11.083 --> 24:12.583
Move.
Moving.

24:20.860 --> 24:22.927
Move.

24:31.103 --> 24:32.102
Clear.

24:32.104 --> 24:33.504
Who are you?

24:33.506 --> 24:35.239
Ncis.
We're here to help.

24:35.241 --> 24:37.908
Nell, tell me when this guy's
close, we'll take him out.

24:38.878 --> 24:40.978
Actually, no, hold off on that.

24:40.980 --> 24:42.112
I got a better idea.

24:42.114 --> 24:44.181
That's never good.

24:45.218 --> 24:46.217
Stop!

24:46.219 --> 24:48.118
Or I'll shoot!

24:55.027 --> 24:56.594
Give me the tablet!

24:58.130 --> 25:00.197
Move!

25:06.272 --> 25:09.273
God, I hope you know
what you're doing.

25:11.110 --> 25:12.743
So, you know how
to use that thing?

25:12.745 --> 25:14.512
Theoretically, sir.

25:14.514 --> 25:16.280
Okay, well then, theoretically,

25:16.282 --> 25:18.716
Let's go ahead and switch it
off of fully automatic to semi.

25:18.718 --> 25:20.251
You know, 'cause,
you know just for...

25:20.253 --> 25:21.785
Safety first and all.

25:21.787 --> 25:23.521
Guys, what's going on?

25:23.523 --> 25:25.189
Well, evidently, brave
and stupid is spreading

25:25.191 --> 25:27.791
Because kensi has swapped
places with cadet, uh...

25:27.793 --> 25:29.527
Porter. Amy porter.

25:29.529 --> 25:32.663
Deeks: Amy porter, and tahir's
taken her into custody.

25:32.665 --> 25:34.031
Of course he has.

25:39.739 --> 25:41.171
Call your father.

25:41.173 --> 25:43.040
Why?

25:43.042 --> 25:46.644
Because he can no longer
run away from me.

25:46.646 --> 25:48.212
My father doesn't run.

25:48.214 --> 25:50.848
Your father is a coward.

25:50.850 --> 25:54.118
He fled from me in sudan
so I had to come to america.

25:54.120 --> 25:57.555
Call him now...

25:57.557 --> 25:59.823
Or I will send you
back to him in pieces.

26:02.828 --> 26:04.628
(keypad beeps)

26:06.332 --> 26:09.033
My father's not afraid of you...

26:09.035 --> 26:11.302
And neither am I.

26:11.304 --> 26:13.637
Then you are both foolish.

26:24.817 --> 26:27.585
Callen:
Guys, we got a blood trail.

26:31.257 --> 26:33.290
If we follow it,
we should find them.

26:33.292 --> 26:34.291
You go.

26:34.293 --> 26:36.260
What are you gonna do?

26:36.262 --> 26:39.697
Tahir isn't here for aiden
or anybody else.

26:39.699 --> 26:42.099
He's here for me.

26:42.101 --> 26:43.734
I'm-a give him what he wants.

26:43.736 --> 26:45.936
Deeks is right.

26:45.938 --> 26:47.805
Brave and stupid is spreading.

26:47.807 --> 26:50.341
While tahir's focused on me,

26:50.343 --> 26:52.109
You can help everyone else
get out of here.

26:52.111 --> 26:53.110
And what about aiden?

26:53.112 --> 26:54.945
I'll take care of aiden.

26:54.947 --> 26:59.149
You just get everyone to safety,
then come looking for us.

26:59.151 --> 27:00.784
I don't like it.
Neither do I,

27:00.786 --> 27:02.119
But you know I'm right.

27:02.121 --> 27:03.921
The react team could
be here any minute.

27:03.923 --> 27:05.222
We don't have a minute.

27:05.224 --> 27:07.925
Eric, talk deeks to me.

27:07.927 --> 27:09.126
"g."

27:10.296 --> 27:13.097
No matter what happens...

27:13.099 --> 27:16.333
Tahir does not get
out of here alive.

27:16.335 --> 27:18.902
He won't.

27:26.846 --> 27:28.178
Sit!

27:30.416 --> 27:32.249
Sit down.

27:32.251 --> 27:34.151
Okay.

27:42.795 --> 27:43.861
You're gonna be okay.

27:44.296 --> 27:46.397
Stop talking.

27:51.837 --> 27:54.738
Call your father.

27:55.374 --> 27:58.142
I will not tell you again.

27:58.144 --> 27:59.943
Sam (over p.A.):
Tahir khaled.

27:59.945 --> 28:01.912
This is sam hanna.

28:01.914 --> 28:03.047
Man:
He's here.

28:03.049 --> 28:04.281
In the school.

28:04.283 --> 28:05.816
Shut up!

28:05.817 --> 28:07.350
You and I have some
unfinished business.

28:07.353 --> 28:10.054
I told you he wasn't afraid.

28:10.056 --> 28:12.723
You stay here.

28:12.725 --> 28:14.758
If anyone comes through
that door other than me,

28:14.760 --> 28:16.126
Kill them!

28:16.128 --> 28:17.995
Then kill him!

28:34.947 --> 28:37.314
Looks like everybody's
in the rec hall on the floor.

28:38.284 --> 28:41.051
I got no sign of aiden.

28:41.053 --> 28:44.121
Got one gsw in need
of extraction.

28:52.898 --> 28:54.198
Five targets.

28:54.200 --> 28:56.266
Two at the
northeast entrance.

28:56.268 --> 28:57.401
One on the stage.

28:57.403 --> 28:59.303
Two more each
at the south doors.

28:59.305 --> 29:00.804
East and west

29:00.806 --> 29:03.207
Entrances are wired with ieds.

29:03.209 --> 29:07.211
Hey, when I stand up,
hit the deck.

29:07.213 --> 29:09.880
Pass it on.

29:09.882 --> 29:12.049
(whispering): Hey, hey,
when I stand up,

29:12.051 --> 29:14.418
Hit the deck, pass it on.

29:14.420 --> 29:16.420
Young woman (whispers):
When she stands up,
hit the deck.

29:16.422 --> 29:17.921
Pass it on.

29:17.923 --> 29:19.957
(overlapping whispering
as cadets pass message)

29:24.997 --> 29:27.231
(sniffs)

29:27.233 --> 29:29.433
Callen, let me know when you
and deeks are at the rec hall.

29:29.435 --> 29:32.503
I'm gonna distract
the guards and when I do,

29:32.505 --> 29:34.538
Everyone in here
will be on the floor.

29:34.540 --> 29:35.506
Copy that.

29:35.508 --> 29:36.974
Where's the girl?

29:36.975 --> 29:38.441
Holed up in a bathroom
with kensi's hk.

29:38.444 --> 29:39.777
Any sign of tahir?

29:39.779 --> 29:41.278
Yeah, we got him.

29:41.280 --> 29:43.480
Nell:
He's coming for you, sam,
with two other gunmen.

29:43.482 --> 29:46.784
This is about to get real,
real fast, folks.

29:46.786 --> 29:48.786
Good, I'm tired of waiting.

29:50.189 --> 29:51.355
"g"?

29:51.357 --> 29:52.556
We're good.

29:52.558 --> 29:53.490
Kens?

29:53.492 --> 29:55.492
Let's do it.

29:55.494 --> 29:57.795
I'll take the guy on the stage.

29:59.064 --> 30:01.131
(moans, sniffles)

30:02.802 --> 30:04.868
(coughs)

30:07.139 --> 30:08.205
(groans)

30:11.310 --> 30:12.376
(muffled cough)

30:12.378 --> 30:13.410
Sit!

30:13.412 --> 30:15.946
I'm s... Oh, s...
I'm sorry,

30:15.948 --> 30:17.347
I just... Seriously, I...

30:17.349 --> 30:18.632
Get down!

30:18.633 --> 30:19.916
Please, I just need
the bathroom.

30:19.919 --> 30:20.918
Oh, my god.

30:20.920 --> 30:21.952
Stop!

30:21.954 --> 30:23.854
(kensi coughing)

30:23.856 --> 30:25.956
Sit!
(coughing)

30:31.397 --> 30:34.531
(cadets screaming)

30:34.533 --> 30:36.500
You brought company, hanna!

30:36.502 --> 30:39.303
Yeah! That's the sound of them
killing your friends.

30:45.177 --> 30:45.909
Kens!

30:47.346 --> 30:48.212
Kensi, down!

30:48.214 --> 30:50.514
(kensi grunting)

30:54.420 --> 30:55.185
You good?

30:56.322 --> 30:58.555
Oh, yeah, I'm great.

30:58.557 --> 31:00.090
That's my girl.

31:00.092 --> 31:01.124
Get them out of here.

31:01.126 --> 31:02.159
I'm going back for sam.

31:02.160 --> 31:03.193
Done. You guys, move.
Double doors.

31:03.195 --> 31:04.728
Guys, let's go,
you heard him.

31:04.729 --> 31:06.262
Let's go, guys.
Come on, up, up, up!

31:06.265 --> 31:08.565
(distant gunfire)

31:08.567 --> 31:10.567
Sounds like your guys are
getting their asses kicked.

31:10.569 --> 31:11.902
Shut up!

31:17.142 --> 31:18.475
You find aiden?

31:18.477 --> 31:19.509
Not yet.

31:19.511 --> 31:21.345
Hurry.

31:21.347 --> 31:23.213
Sam:
All right, all right, all right!

31:23.215 --> 31:24.281
I'm coming out!

31:25.551 --> 31:27.618
I'm coming out!

31:32.558 --> 31:34.958
I'm coming out!

31:54.113 --> 31:55.946
Tahir...

31:55.948 --> 31:57.414
This is between

31:57.416 --> 32:00.017
Me and you.

32:00.019 --> 32:01.685
Let my son and the others go.

32:03.656 --> 32:05.422
I...

32:05.424 --> 32:07.925
Make the rules now.

32:21.273 --> 32:23.407
Drop it, tahir!

32:32.952 --> 32:35.452
It's over, tahir.

32:37.589 --> 32:39.690
Where's my son?

32:39.692 --> 32:41.992
I imagine he is dead by now...

32:45.297 --> 32:48.432
...But I'm sure he'll be
waiting for you in hell.

32:48.434 --> 32:50.701
(both grunting)

32:52.004 --> 32:54.504
Callen: Kensi, deeks,
any sign of aiden?

32:54.506 --> 32:56.139
No, but the react team is here.

32:56.141 --> 32:58.175
They're sweeping in now
to take care of tahir's men.

32:58.177 --> 33:01.044
None of the guys we took out
was the one who grabbed me.

33:02.214 --> 33:04.748
Oh, hold on a second,
he took aiden's tablet.

33:04.750 --> 33:06.016
I bet he still has it.

33:06.018 --> 33:07.484
It's in a classroom.

33:07.486 --> 33:10.287
Room 138, west of the
gym's main entrance.

33:10.289 --> 33:12.222
(footsteps approaching)

33:14.360 --> 33:15.492
Tahir?

33:15.494 --> 33:17.060
(gunfire, man grunts)

33:21.300 --> 33:22.499
You alone?

33:22.501 --> 33:23.266
Yeah.

33:27.006 --> 33:28.589
Is my dad okay?

33:28.590 --> 33:30.173
Will be after he sees you.

33:30.175 --> 33:31.575
If you're done
hanging around.

33:31.577 --> 33:33.543
Yeah.

33:36.415 --> 33:38.548
Hetty, we got
everyone out safely.

33:38.550 --> 33:39.816
Thank god.

33:39.817 --> 33:41.083
(blows thudding, men grunting
over monitor speakers)

33:41.086 --> 33:42.085
And the team?

33:42.087 --> 33:44.388
Yeah, they're good.

33:44.390 --> 33:46.790
What's that I'm hearing?

33:46.792 --> 33:49.426
(men grunting,
blows thudding)

33:49.428 --> 33:51.695
I think that's personal.

33:51.697 --> 33:52.729
(both grunting)

33:54.767 --> 33:56.466
Okay.

33:56.468 --> 33:57.667
(yells)

34:06.712 --> 34:08.045
Dad?

34:10.215 --> 34:12.449
(tahir yells, groans in pain)

34:21.827 --> 34:23.060
React team soldier:
You okay here?

34:23.062 --> 34:24.594
It's good, I got this.

34:24.596 --> 34:25.462
We're okay.

34:25.464 --> 34:26.763
(both grunting)

34:34.840 --> 34:37.808
(gasps)

34:56.095 --> 34:57.294
Get this one
out of here, guys.

34:57.296 --> 34:59.596
Dad.

35:02.768 --> 35:04.734
(sighs)

35:06.438 --> 35:08.805
You okay?

35:08.807 --> 35:10.307
Yeah.

35:10.309 --> 35:11.508
You?

35:11.510 --> 35:13.577
Of course.

35:16.882 --> 35:17.747
Thanks for helping me.

35:17.749 --> 35:20.117
I wanted it to be fair.

35:20.119 --> 35:22.352
I knew you
would take him.

35:23.655 --> 35:24.888
You guys okay?
Callen: We're good.

35:24.890 --> 35:26.756
Yeah.

35:26.758 --> 35:29.126
Looking good
rocking the hk, porter.

35:29.128 --> 35:30.494
Oh, yeah,
I'm gonna go ahead

35:30.496 --> 35:32.596
And just<i> real</i> gently
take that back from you.

35:32.598 --> 35:33.663
Okay.

35:33.665 --> 35:35.198
Good work on not...
Killing anyone.

35:35.200 --> 35:37.134
Aiden:
Porter,

35:37.136 --> 35:38.168
This is my dad.

35:38.170 --> 35:39.436
She helped me out a lot.

35:39.438 --> 35:41.438
Not really.

35:41.440 --> 35:42.772
Nice job, porter.

35:42.774 --> 35:44.674
Thank you, sir.

35:45.477 --> 35:46.843
I'd like to get back

35:46.845 --> 35:49.513
To my fellow cadets,
if that's possible, sir.

35:49.515 --> 35:51.815
Yeah, no, absolutely,
we'll go find them.

35:51.817 --> 35:53.450
Glad you're both okay.

35:54.920 --> 35:56.586
Well, I mean, now this...

35:56.588 --> 35:58.655
This would make
a great family portrait.

35:58.657 --> 36:01.491
Hanna boys kicking ass
and taking names.

36:01.493 --> 36:02.559
Don't encourage him.

36:02.561 --> 36:03.560
(chuckles)

36:03.562 --> 36:04.594
You know...
Yeah?

36:04.596 --> 36:06.663
You can never, ever, ever

36:06.665 --> 36:08.732
Tell your mother
about this part.

36:08.734 --> 36:10.834
Speaking of which,
you need to call michelle.

36:10.836 --> 36:12.903
He's right.

36:12.905 --> 36:14.638
Here, call your mom.

36:14.640 --> 36:16.273
Right.
Whoa.

36:17.476 --> 36:19.576
She's gonna want to hear
from him way more than

36:19.578 --> 36:20.911
She wants to hear from me.

36:20.913 --> 36:22.546
Aiden: Yeah.
Sam: Trust me.

36:22.548 --> 36:23.680
Let's get you patched up.

36:23.682 --> 36:25.715
I don't like driving around

36:25.717 --> 36:27.250
With my partner
looking all banged up.

36:27.252 --> 36:28.818
Makes people think
I don't take care of you.

36:28.820 --> 36:29.853
(laughs)

36:29.855 --> 36:31.221
You guys are funny.

36:31.223 --> 36:32.222
It's not funny.

36:32.224 --> 36:34.074
It's sarcasm.

36:34.075 --> 36:35.925
You know, sarcasm is the lowest
form of wit according to...

36:35.928 --> 36:37.394
Oscar wilde.

36:37.396 --> 36:38.728
That's right.
Mm-hmm.

36:38.730 --> 36:40.897
I don't think oscar wilde
would have saved your life.

36:42.301 --> 36:44.601
(groans)
come on.

36:47.372 --> 36:48.405
Kensi: Hey.

36:48.407 --> 36:50.307
Deeks:
How's the lieutenant?

36:50.309 --> 36:51.992
Just fine, other than the fact

36:51.993 --> 36:53.676
That she's about to get a bullet
removed from her thigh.

36:53.679 --> 36:55.645
It's nothing an
anchor tattoo can't hide.

36:55.647 --> 36:56.780
I'm sorry, what?

36:56.782 --> 36:58.348
On the account that
she's in the navy.

36:58.350 --> 36:59.950
You know, get a big
ol' anchor tattoo,

36:59.952 --> 37:01.818
Just like popeye
has on his forearm.

37:01.820 --> 37:03.787
Can you imagine seeing that
when the pants come off?

37:03.789 --> 37:05.789
(in gruff voice):
Ahoy, matey!

37:05.791 --> 37:07.390
You mind if I
drop me anchor?

37:07.392 --> 37:09.226
Oh, my gosh, let me know
when you're finished, please.

37:09.228 --> 37:10.377
I'm done.

37:10.378 --> 37:11.527
I'm so exhausted;
I haven't slept.

37:11.530 --> 37:13.463
Uh...

37:13.465 --> 37:14.931
What's wrong with you?
You all right?

37:14.933 --> 37:17.267
I don't know, I just think
I have something in my eye.

37:17.269 --> 37:19.603
I think it's just that pretty
little birthmark of yours.

37:19.605 --> 37:20.937
Thank you, but why
don't you just...

37:20.939 --> 37:21.838
See if you can see something?

37:21.840 --> 37:22.939
Is there something there?

37:22.941 --> 37:24.307
I don't see anything.

37:24.309 --> 37:25.542
No...
I don't see anything.

37:25.544 --> 37:26.543
Oh, wow.

37:26.545 --> 37:27.711
I appreciate your

37:27.713 --> 37:29.479
Stealthy operational skills,

37:29.481 --> 37:31.581
Special agent blye, but you
should know you've got a...

37:31.583 --> 37:32.616
(clears throat)

37:32.618 --> 37:33.950
You got a little
bat in the cave.

37:33.952 --> 37:35.752
What?
You've got... What?

37:35.754 --> 37:37.387
Oh, my gosh, deeks, what?
That's...

37:37.389 --> 37:39.256
That's the...
That's the honesty of love.

37:39.258 --> 37:41.424
That's how much I love you,
is that I tell you that,

37:41.426 --> 37:42.926
Listen, we're having a special
moment, but you should know

37:42.928 --> 37:45.729
You've got a sweet, little
boogie in your nose hole.

37:45.731 --> 37:47.330
What, you think your friends
are gonna say something?

37:47.332 --> 37:49.082
No, they're just
gonna stare at you,

37:49.083 --> 37:50.833
Not say a word, so you walk
around the mall with a big...

37:50.836 --> 37:51.835
What?

37:51.837 --> 37:52.836
Oh!

37:52.838 --> 37:54.871
Ew! Aah! No!

37:54.873 --> 37:55.972
Deeks:
Ah, backfire. Oh!

37:55.974 --> 37:57.574
Kensi:
I think I got it.
Ah...!

38:00.579 --> 38:02.612
Tahir is on his way to
the district courthouse

38:02.614 --> 38:04.548
In san francisco.

38:04.549 --> 38:06.483
They're gonna keep him in
atwater for the time being.

38:06.485 --> 38:08.551
Good.

38:11.957 --> 38:14.958
This could have gone bad.

38:14.960 --> 38:16.660
Yeah.

38:16.662 --> 38:18.061
But it didn't.

38:19.931 --> 38:22.332
I'll see you at the hospital.

38:22.334 --> 38:24.401
G...

38:27.673 --> 38:28.972
Thank you.

38:31.843 --> 38:33.443
This is what we do, brother.

38:48.560 --> 38:51.828
Hi. Do you need us
for anything else?

38:51.830 --> 38:53.496
No.

38:53.498 --> 38:55.865
You're welcome to join us.

38:55.867 --> 38:58.802
It's 6:30 in the morning.

38:58.804 --> 39:01.104
Well, you can pour it
on your fruit loops.

39:01.106 --> 39:03.340
The hell he can.

39:03.342 --> 39:06.776
Hmm, I think
we'll take a pass.

39:06.778 --> 39:11.047
Well, I'd congratulate
you on a job well done,

39:11.049 --> 39:15.018
Except it looks like you've
already been celebrating.

39:15.020 --> 39:16.519
Hmm?

39:21.026 --> 39:24.127
Oh, for god sakes, you've
got lipstick on your cheek.

39:24.129 --> 39:28.898
Oh, um... Th-- oh,
t-this is, um, this is jam.

39:28.900 --> 39:30.967
I was eating a jam sandwich.

39:30.969 --> 39:32.369
He loves jam.

39:32.371 --> 39:33.970
Organic cherry preserves...
Nell: Right.

39:33.972 --> 39:35.805
...With a toasted, um...

39:35.807 --> 39:38.108
Like a whole wheat, was...

39:38.110 --> 39:39.142
Really delicious.
Very jammy. Very-very...

39:39.144 --> 39:40.927
All right,
mm-hmm, well...

39:40.928 --> 39:42.711
Upstairs-- I mean, there's
no food in ops, but there...

39:42.714 --> 39:43.947
(nell clears throat)
...There was just a moment

39:43.949 --> 39:44.948
We were eating,
just a quick...

39:44.950 --> 39:46.383
Nell: Well...
(clears throat)

39:46.385 --> 39:47.884
Yeah, all right,
good-good-good-bye.

39:47.886 --> 39:49.819
Good day.
Nell: Good-bye.

39:49.821 --> 39:51.488
(chuckles)
good-bye.
'cause... Okay.

39:58.563 --> 40:00.630
(phone ringing)

40:05.537 --> 40:09.005
You want to answer that?

40:09.007 --> 40:13.009
Uh... Not really.

40:13.011 --> 40:14.511
What about you?

40:14.513 --> 40:15.545
<i> (phone continues ringing)</i>

40:15.547 --> 40:16.813
Granger:
<i> Hell, no.</i>
