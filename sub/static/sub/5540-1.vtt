01:03.104 --> 01:05.774
Do you know why most nations,

01:05.917 --> 01:08.314
countries, civilizations fail?

01:09.041 --> 01:10.416
<i>Nyet.</i>

01:11.096 --> 01:12.195
It's their inability

01:12.221 --> 01:15.534
to recognize the examples of
those who came before them.

01:17.502 --> 01:19.204
You see, things have a way of...

01:19.330 --> 01:21.752
repeating themselves, General.

01:22.366 --> 01:24.674
Yeah...

01:24.752 --> 01:26.244
Explain.

01:26.962 --> 01:28.380
History.

01:28.642 --> 01:32.290
It's shown that the average age
of a civilization is around...

01:32.722 --> 01:34.186
200 years.

01:35.570 --> 01:37.681
Countries like Great Britain...

01:38.171 --> 01:39.456
America...

01:40.086 --> 01:41.221
Russia...

01:41.517 --> 01:43.346
they exceed the average,

01:43.729 --> 01:46.503
while others are just
now reaching that age.

01:47.765 --> 01:48.947
Haiti.

01:50.316 --> 01:52.947
Each of the great
civilizations of the world,

01:53.254 --> 01:55.298
they've passed through a series

01:55.324 --> 01:56.660
of ten stages.

01:57.652 --> 01:59.536
From birth to decline,

01:59.578 --> 02:01.538
and ultimately, to their death.

02:02.074 --> 02:03.582
It's ironic, isn't it?

02:05.801 --> 02:09.465
The first generation throws
off the shackles of bondage,

02:09.550 --> 02:13.555
only to have a later generation,
through apathy and indifference,

02:13.604 --> 02:16.401
allow themselves to be enslaved.

02:18.680 --> 02:20.629
Which brings me back...

02:21.707 --> 02:24.019
to my previous question.

02:24.436 --> 02:26.058
Why...

02:26.438 --> 02:29.097
do most civilization fail?

02:32.454 --> 02:34.090
Choice.

03:31.461 --> 03:33.463
<i>We were known as The Strap Set,</i>

03:33.797 --> 03:36.157
<i>enforcers of the Costa syndicate.</i>

03:36.227 --> 03:37.092
Let's work.

03:37.134 --> 03:39.511
<i>When the established
order was disrupted,</i>

03:39.553 --> 03:42.389
<i>we would inflict
punishment to the letter.</i>

03:42.702 --> 03:45.264
<i>It was a necessary evil, General.</i>

03:45.860 --> 03:48.522
<i>We... were necessary.</i>

05:50.309 --> 05:51.310
Yah!

06:17.631 --> 06:18.967
Bravo.

06:19.514 --> 06:21.874
That was quite a show you put on.

06:22.049 --> 06:23.842
I'm actually flattered
that Angelo would send

06:23.884 --> 06:26.803
his prized attack dogs
to pay me a visit.

06:27.827 --> 06:29.639
Don't flatter yourself.

06:29.681 --> 06:31.892
Rules were broken...

06:32.358 --> 06:35.312
decisions were made, and
orders were carried out.

06:35.802 --> 06:39.122
This whole messy business today
could have been avoided.

06:39.983 --> 06:41.467
But you...

06:41.776 --> 06:44.279
chose to swim in waters

06:44.321 --> 06:45.530
too deep for you.

06:45.921 --> 06:48.541
Don't talk to me like you're
one of us- you're not.

06:48.725 --> 06:50.344
I'm a member of the syndicate,
and therefore protected,

06:50.369 --> 06:53.827
- but you, you're just an errand boy.
- Pardon me.

06:55.369 --> 06:57.413
This is phenomenal bourbon.

06:57.952 --> 06:59.561
You know,
it starts off clear- they put it

06:59.586 --> 07:01.775
in wooden barrels so
that it gets its color.

07:01.801 --> 07:02.530
Mm.

07:02.648 --> 07:05.483
The longer it cooks,
the deeper the flavor,

07:05.776 --> 07:07.569
the darker that it gets.

07:09.218 --> 07:12.421
But if left too long,
it becomes unbalanced,

07:13.179 --> 07:14.906
loses its integrity.

07:16.462 --> 07:19.656
Is that what you are... Feris?

07:22.356 --> 07:24.441
Unbalanced?

07:27.409 --> 07:28.740
I mean, you got to be

07:28.782 --> 07:31.159
to pull off some stunt like this,
huh?

07:31.573 --> 07:33.703
You expect me to
take this lying down?

07:35.435 --> 07:37.526
I don't care how you take it.

07:38.307 --> 07:39.434
It doesn't negate the fact

07:39.459 --> 07:42.370
that product was
delivered in good faith,

07:42.409 --> 07:44.631
based off our previous arrangement.

07:44.672 --> 07:46.633
Now, the shipment

07:46.674 --> 07:48.802
was received...

07:49.151 --> 07:51.386
but the funds...

07:52.214 --> 07:53.995
were not wired.

07:54.224 --> 07:55.964
Why is that?

07:56.362 --> 08:00.021
You know how it is-
these things take time.

08:00.432 --> 08:03.524
Angelo is getting
impatient in his old age.

08:03.932 --> 08:06.736
Or perhaps a little show of power

08:06.778 --> 08:08.738
is to keep up appearances, huh?

08:08.780 --> 08:10.675
Perhaps the wolf

08:10.701 --> 08:12.761
has lost its claws.

08:14.073 --> 08:16.371
You better be sure,<i> papi.</i>

08:17.053 --> 08:19.378
Taxation without representation.

08:23.247 --> 08:24.998
Hey, Feris.

08:26.154 --> 08:28.076
Pay your bill.

08:28.761 --> 08:30.967
You'll live longer.

08:54.857 --> 08:56.650
Hey,
I'm taking care of business here.

08:56.676 --> 08:58.026
I'll call you back.

09:05.437 --> 09:06.862
Hey, breh?

09:13.387 --> 09:15.495
Yo, how many more stops
we got to make today?

09:15.557 --> 09:17.307
Got one more.

09:17.793 --> 09:19.726
I promise this one gonna be quick.

09:19.767 --> 09:21.561
We'll be in and out of
there in about five,

09:21.602 --> 09:23.698
seven and a half minutes tops.

09:23.724 --> 09:26.351
It's all part of the plan, gentlemen.

09:26.377 --> 09:27.796
Fear equals respect.

09:28.590 --> 09:30.622
Respect equals power.

09:31.150 --> 09:32.614
Simple math.

11:01.809 --> 11:03.978
You test me again, huh?

11:04.411 --> 11:06.661
My supplier's the best in town.

11:06.851 --> 11:08.227
See for yourself.

11:08.285 --> 11:09.833
Half of the shipment are marked

11:09.859 --> 11:12.034
and ready for street use.

11:12.060 --> 11:14.724
The other half covered
by special papers

11:15.357 --> 11:17.676
with the serial code's still intact

11:17.718 --> 11:20.763
for legal distribution, no problem.

11:23.430 --> 11:25.599
You never let me down.

11:26.773 --> 11:28.317
Money's all there.

11:28.708 --> 11:30.773
Ten percent commission as always.

11:31.166 --> 11:33.669
The rest I'll wire you.

11:35.836 --> 11:37.129
There's no need.

11:37.646 --> 11:39.669
You and I both know

11:39.695 --> 11:41.544
if it's not correct...

11:44.448 --> 11:47.411
...I'm gonna find you,
put a hole in your head.

11:55.768 --> 11:58.138
Just joking around.

11:59.790 --> 12:01.310
Everything's in order.

12:01.999 --> 12:04.599
Let me know if you
need anything more.

12:34.588 --> 12:36.396
Good afternoon, Mr. Costa.

12:36.466 --> 12:38.909
I'm your new CFO, as per
your father's request.

12:38.935 --> 12:40.801
If you would just direct me towards

12:40.843 --> 12:43.114
your books,
I can get started right away.

12:43.153 --> 12:44.805
What the fuck is this?

12:47.693 --> 12:49.284
Every other day he sends

12:49.310 --> 12:52.105
another one of you
fucking guys down here

12:52.146 --> 12:54.216
to break my balls.

12:55.333 --> 12:58.010
I swear to Christ, he's got to
be running an affirmative action

12:58.036 --> 12:59.421
campaign down there. He's got...

12:59.446 --> 13:01.489
he's got a million of these
assholes running around.

13:04.117 --> 13:08.177
Run and go tell my father I
don't need him or anybody else

13:08.232 --> 13:11.122
to babysit my fucking money,
all right?

13:11.148 --> 13:13.733
I'm a big boy.
I handle my own affairs.

13:13.759 --> 13:16.045
With all due respect, sir,
your current spending habits

13:16.087 --> 13:20.295
are attracting a lot of unwanted
attention from the IRS.

13:20.732 --> 13:23.595
That's attention that your
father wants to go away.

13:24.115 --> 13:25.722
I don't know you,

13:25.803 --> 13:28.607
and whether or not you
work for my old man...

13:29.904 --> 13:31.478
how the fuck

13:32.053 --> 13:34.188
am I gonna trust you?

13:34.795 --> 13:37.108
I work for every major organization

13:37.150 --> 13:40.420
including your father's. I
have a PhD from Harvard.

13:40.498 --> 13:42.514
Business and economics.

13:43.693 --> 13:46.033
My firm, my reputation

13:46.075 --> 13:48.161
are impeccable, sir.

13:48.545 --> 13:50.747
Who the fuck you think
you're talking to?

13:50.789 --> 13:52.707
You ever look down
your nose at me again,

13:52.749 --> 13:54.684
I'll blow that Harvard-educated
brain of yours all over

13:54.709 --> 13:58.212
my marble floor without batting
an eyelid, understand?

13:58.254 --> 14:02.008
Now run and go tell my father if
he has something to say to me,

14:02.283 --> 14:04.036
come tell me himself.

14:04.709 --> 14:05.886
Shouldn't send a monkey

14:05.928 --> 14:07.717
to do a man's job.

14:07.743 --> 14:09.537
Now get the fuck out of my sunlight.

14:09.563 --> 14:11.717
You're ruining my tan, asshole.

15:03.079 --> 15:04.779
Please.

15:10.535 --> 15:12.873
But in this world...

15:13.670 --> 15:15.542
loyalty, honor

15:15.568 --> 15:17.107
and discretion

15:17.958 --> 15:20.959
are our most valuable commodities.

15:22.214 --> 15:24.200
Without them,

15:25.080 --> 15:26.999
man is like a wild animal,

15:27.514 --> 15:30.131
clawing his way through the forest,

15:30.341 --> 15:33.261
cutting a path to
his own destruction.

15:35.654 --> 15:37.889
Before our exile, brother,

15:38.271 --> 15:41.420
there were many who
thought like you do now.

15:42.740 --> 15:45.006
Willing to sacrifice everything

15:45.474 --> 15:47.357
for the ones they love.

15:47.920 --> 15:50.756
But like with all sacrifice,

15:51.412 --> 15:53.037
there is no action

15:54.120 --> 15:56.205
without consequence.

15:59.169 --> 16:01.732
I love and respect you,

16:03.060 --> 16:04.464
but there is no longer

16:04.505 --> 16:06.591
a place for you here.

16:13.970 --> 16:15.865
No, wait.

17:46.304 --> 17:48.080
The shipment arrived

17:48.129 --> 17:50.367
intact and on time-

17:51.289 --> 17:52.655
L.A. Harbor, Pier 13.

17:52.697 --> 17:55.773
It's registered under
a Michael Donaldson.

17:56.742 --> 17:59.746
Any problems with our
associates in customs?

17:59.787 --> 18:01.727
Nothing unforeseeable.

18:02.807 --> 18:05.242
The customary bribes were in order.

18:06.150 --> 18:08.102
It's business as usual.

18:08.755 --> 18:10.130
Good.

18:10.453 --> 18:11.857
Notify Khalil.

18:12.078 --> 18:15.595
Have him to move the rest
of the previous inventory

18:15.636 --> 18:17.513
to the foreign buyers.

18:18.047 --> 18:20.914
We'll need to make room
for the new shipment.

18:21.308 --> 18:22.810
The planes are scheduled to arrive

18:22.852 --> 18:24.883
within two hours.

18:24.910 --> 18:27.046
We already have vehicles
waiting for them.

18:27.774 --> 18:29.734
Outstanding.

18:29.776 --> 18:31.110
What would I do without you?

18:43.914 --> 18:46.813
Be only half as powerful as you are.

18:47.919 --> 18:50.854
These buyers can be a
bit difficult to sell.

18:51.793 --> 18:54.172
Are you sure that Khalil is up to it?

18:54.968 --> 18:57.336
I have all confidence in him.

18:57.816 --> 18:59.192
After all,

18:59.555 --> 19:00.977
he is my son.

19:01.371 --> 19:02.851
He is.

19:03.334 --> 19:04.477
Fine, then.

19:04.503 --> 19:06.589
I'll be in the car waiting.

19:10.038 --> 19:12.080
Get rid of the body.

19:21.201 --> 19:23.496
I don't know why I put up with you.

19:23.537 --> 19:25.665
You constantly disrespect me.

19:26.268 --> 19:28.010
You never want to go anywhere,

19:28.080 --> 19:29.460
at least not with me.

19:29.502 --> 19:30.895
Yo, can you just try to stop bitching

19:30.920 --> 19:32.505
for, like, a half an hour?

19:32.546 --> 19:34.065
All right?
Just until this game's over.

19:34.090 --> 19:35.307
Please?

19:36.276 --> 19:37.844
Hmm. No.

19:37.885 --> 19:40.830
What I want is for you
to just be real with me.

19:41.768 --> 19:43.182
Damn, Zho, come on.

19:43.208 --> 19:44.510
For once in your pathetic life

19:44.536 --> 19:45.871
just tell the damn truth.

19:47.061 --> 19:48.221
A'ight.

19:49.063 --> 19:50.606
You a good-looking chick.

19:50.648 --> 19:53.010
A little darker than
what I usually go for,

19:53.036 --> 19:56.065
but based on your SAT scores,
I figure...

19:56.377 --> 19:57.635
Fuck it, I...

19:57.661 --> 20:01.080
I'll make an exception on the
account that you're smart.

20:02.104 --> 20:04.203
See,
everything was cool in the beginning.

20:04.244 --> 20:08.207
You know? But like most females,
you... you got comfortable.

20:08.248 --> 20:11.713
And started running your
fucking mouth too much.

20:12.190 --> 20:13.253
Never content

20:13.295 --> 20:15.447
with the way that things are.

20:16.053 --> 20:19.048
See, you want to turn me
into somebody I'm not.

20:20.882 --> 20:22.341
So, yeah, you-you...

20:22.367 --> 20:24.135
you got a hot little body...

20:24.783 --> 20:27.203
but you don't use it
to its full potential.

20:28.502 --> 20:31.080
I mean, baby, your sex game is...

20:31.776 --> 20:33.377
decent.

20:33.983 --> 20:35.943
But you don't give head, I mean...

20:35.985 --> 20:37.528
what the fuck kind of girl

20:37.554 --> 20:39.908
in this day and age
doesn't give head?

20:41.365 --> 20:42.575
Seriously?

20:42.616 --> 20:44.118
Like, are you fucking serious?

20:44.160 --> 20:46.237
<i>That's</i> disrespectful.

20:47.413 --> 20:48.789
So, yeah, I...

20:48.831 --> 20:50.833
I fucked some other chicks.

20:50.875 --> 20:53.346
Not on a personal level, but...

20:54.309 --> 20:55.354
just to help out.

20:55.380 --> 20:57.966
You know,
where you might be a little weak.

20:59.836 --> 21:01.504
And to answer your question,

21:01.530 --> 21:03.049
do I care?

21:05.420 --> 21:07.171
Yeah, of course.

21:07.292 --> 21:08.916
Do I care about

21:09.362 --> 21:11.596
saving this relationship?

21:13.480 --> 21:14.776
No.

21:16.024 --> 21:17.540
Not really.

21:24.075 --> 21:25.284
Fuck you.

21:28.947 --> 21:31.221
See, the truth hurts.

21:42.885 --> 21:44.651
Gentlemen.

21:45.518 --> 21:46.933
You are all quite familiar

21:46.959 --> 21:50.331
with our reputation for being
ahead of our competitors.

21:51.644 --> 21:54.433
In simple terms,
we deal the best product,

21:54.981 --> 21:56.479
shuffle the bullshit,

21:57.136 --> 21:58.308
cut the debt.

21:59.519 --> 22:01.956
Now, I am prepared

22:01.988 --> 22:05.394
to offer you a most
generous proposal.

22:06.022 --> 22:08.391
A proposal that will stand
for the next ten minutes,

22:08.417 --> 22:10.419
at which point all
deals must be final,

22:10.453 --> 22:13.030
or the offer goes into remission.

22:17.670 --> 22:19.046
Ten minutes...

22:19.088 --> 22:20.422
Fuckin' ridiculous.

22:37.106 --> 22:39.108
Three containers,

22:39.150 --> 22:42.736
each filled with 30,000 AK-47s,

22:42.778 --> 22:45.156
courtesy of Kalashnikov himself.

22:45.917 --> 22:48.701
The cargo will be sent by boat,
not by air,

22:48.742 --> 22:52.412
and remain intact bonded with
seals and paperwork attached.

22:52.454 --> 22:54.167
No one will touch it.

22:55.291 --> 22:58.585
Now, the catch is you must
purchase the entire container.

22:58.627 --> 23:01.130
Now, I'm willing to let 'em
go for $20 million a pop,

23:01.172 --> 23:03.386
granted you all say "yes"
to this deal, not now

23:03.412 --> 23:05.831
but right now,
seven minutes and counting.

23:05.947 --> 23:08.445
Let me put it to you in terms
you can understand, all right?

23:08.470 --> 23:09.680
It'll be like

23:10.190 --> 23:13.026
comparing curried goat to oxtails.

23:13.690 --> 23:15.144
I mean, why do it?

23:15.186 --> 23:16.526
Huh?

23:16.913 --> 23:19.119
They both taste good.

23:24.925 --> 23:26.530
Khalil,

23:26.572 --> 23:28.657
you have a way with words.

23:30.768 --> 23:31.785
What?

23:31.827 --> 23:33.925
You told him to fuck off?

23:34.705 --> 23:35.808
Nicky,

23:35.834 --> 23:38.629
I sent him there to help you.

23:38.655 --> 23:41.406
How many times are we gonna
have this conversation?

23:42.525 --> 23:44.443
I am sending Dwight back.

23:44.469 --> 23:45.982
You extend every courtesy.

23:46.008 --> 23:47.925
Do what you have to do,

23:48.051 --> 23:49.552
but you fix this.

23:49.845 --> 23:51.143
Today.

23:55.056 --> 23:56.766
Kids today.

23:57.896 --> 23:59.397
They got no respect for anyone.

24:00.112 --> 24:01.232
I'm sorry.

24:01.274 --> 24:02.964
It's not a problem, boss.

24:23.010 --> 24:24.637
He's a good kid.

24:25.065 --> 24:26.995
Sometimes he makes it very difficult

24:27.021 --> 24:29.136
for me to carry out your orders.

24:29.557 --> 24:31.276
So the deal holds.

24:31.469 --> 24:32.940
Good. He'll take care of it.

24:32.966 --> 24:34.776
Maybe this will cheer you up.

24:34.802 --> 24:36.729
- There he is.
- Top shelf.

24:37.620 --> 24:39.167
Courtesy Feris.

24:39.193 --> 24:40.821
Look out for this kid.

24:41.147 --> 24:43.523
He'll be running the
entire city one day.

24:43.705 --> 24:45.499
- Neat?
- Always.

24:48.706 --> 24:50.539
You know, every man dreams

24:50.565 --> 24:51.782
of having a son.

24:52.401 --> 24:53.784
Somebody to, uh, remind the world

24:53.826 --> 24:55.979
that he was there one day.

24:58.214 --> 24:59.719
I don't know. I thought I...

24:59.745 --> 25:01.253
Thank you.

25:01.323 --> 25:03.627
I thought I did everything
I could to make him a man,

25:03.669 --> 25:04.690
but I spoiled him.

25:05.964 --> 25:08.882
Gave him too much, made
him earn too little.

25:08.924 --> 25:10.487
Consequently...

25:11.690 --> 25:13.179
kid's a goddamn punk.

25:14.708 --> 25:17.794
He'll get it going. He just
needs a little bit of time

25:17.993 --> 25:20.015
for him to learn the ropes.

25:20.242 --> 25:22.855
That's what I wanted
to talk to you about.

25:22.896 --> 25:25.316
Dwight, Nick's waiting for you.

25:25.358 --> 25:27.969
- Deal still holds. Okay.
- You got it, boss.

25:37.372 --> 25:39.382
It appears...

25:43.679 --> 25:45.538
I have a tumor...

25:46.678 --> 25:48.288
in my brain.

25:50.231 --> 25:52.249
It's inoperable.

25:53.929 --> 25:55.388
They tell me, in a very short time,

25:55.429 --> 25:57.848
it'll be difficult for me
to do the simplest things,

25:57.890 --> 25:59.749
make the simplest decisions.

26:01.219 --> 26:03.007
I got six months.

26:05.211 --> 26:07.380
A year at best.

26:07.702 --> 26:09.651
Wow.

26:11.028 --> 26:12.570
I'm sorry, Angelo.

26:12.874 --> 26:14.114
Ah, that's okay.

26:14.421 --> 26:18.350
But be that as it may,
business continues as usual,

26:18.411 --> 26:21.835
and I need someone I can
trust to take care of things

26:21.861 --> 26:23.320
when I step down.

26:23.346 --> 26:26.030
Oh, I mean, Nicholas-
he's a good man at heart.

26:26.056 --> 26:28.837
I mean, he might be a little
rough around the edges,

26:28.879 --> 26:30.172
but you know...

26:30.214 --> 26:31.996
What I'm trying to say here

26:32.022 --> 26:33.397
is that I'm offering you a chance

26:33.431 --> 26:36.382
to run things for whatever
time I have left.

26:37.350 --> 26:38.514
I need someone I can trust,

26:38.540 --> 26:41.100
someone I can count
on to do things right.

26:41.623 --> 26:43.708
I'm not gonna bullshit you here.

26:43.819 --> 26:46.480
You'll never be truly
accepted by the other bosses.

26:47.257 --> 26:48.524
They'll hate you,

26:48.566 --> 26:50.710
and probably everybody
who works for you.

26:51.874 --> 26:53.987
I don't know.

26:54.029 --> 26:56.843
I kind of like what I
already got going on.

26:58.335 --> 27:00.296
I see no reason

27:00.578 --> 27:02.780
why I should put my men

27:02.955 --> 27:04.873
in an uncomfortable situation.

27:04.915 --> 27:06.585
I'm asking you this...

27:08.866 --> 27:10.663
as a favor to me,

27:11.529 --> 27:13.053
to take care of things

27:13.079 --> 27:15.170
until my son is more capable.

27:15.956 --> 27:17.421
For me.

27:18.845 --> 27:20.718
You do what I ask.

27:23.063 --> 27:24.569
I humbly...

27:29.473 --> 27:30.819
...accept.

27:30.949 --> 27:32.451
Excellent.

27:34.321 --> 27:36.022
Let's have this drink.

27:47.617 --> 27:49.362
What's up?

27:51.451 --> 27:53.813
It's all here, every penny.

27:56.445 --> 27:58.107
What do you have?

27:58.133 --> 28:00.508
My man, same thing she's having.

28:01.250 --> 28:03.015
You know I trust you, right?

28:03.056 --> 28:04.351
- Um...
- You know you ain't got

28:04.377 --> 28:05.594
to tell me that every
time we meet up.

28:05.619 --> 28:08.411
You know me, right?
I like to keep things thorough.

28:08.437 --> 28:11.460
Friend or no friend,
I can't afford any mishaps.

28:11.811 --> 28:14.390
I feel you. I feel you.

28:15.741 --> 28:17.368
So, how's Soo?

28:19.710 --> 28:21.699
Worse than ever before.

28:22.515 --> 28:24.161
Believe it or not,

28:24.203 --> 28:27.007
I like her better
when she was with you.

28:28.132 --> 28:31.515
You made her happy
and kept her on track.

28:31.916 --> 28:35.253
Now she's getting high
and drunk all the time.

28:35.709 --> 28:37.874
Always with the wrong people.

28:39.852 --> 28:43.147
I feel like I'm... I'm losing her.

28:45.046 --> 28:47.270
You know it's a gift and a curse, Li,

28:47.296 --> 28:49.327
what we do, you and me.

28:51.182 --> 28:54.546
We make plenty of money, but
we always lose who we love.

28:55.564 --> 28:58.944
I guess we are the same
in that regard, huh?

29:04.890 --> 29:07.194
Business is easier to cope with.

29:07.460 --> 29:10.541
Personal shit is always complicating.

29:10.851 --> 29:12.501
Complicates things.

29:12.543 --> 29:14.336
You are probably right.

29:15.398 --> 29:18.605
Besides, I'm way too much
woman for you to handle.

29:18.631 --> 29:20.069
Hey...

29:20.850 --> 29:22.467
I didn't say all that.

29:28.459 --> 29:29.780
Hello.

29:29.879 --> 29:31.624
Tuggs. Yeah.

29:31.801 --> 29:34.262
Where is it? I'm on the way.

29:37.643 --> 29:39.319
What's up?

29:39.663 --> 29:42.903
I... I got a little
something to take care of.

29:42.929 --> 29:44.476
I'll see you later.

29:44.538 --> 29:46.660
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Wait.

29:46.702 --> 29:49.273
You're not right.
Let me roll with you.

29:49.322 --> 29:51.240
I appreciate it, but...

29:51.773 --> 29:53.584
I'm good. I got it.

29:54.609 --> 29:55.905
Hey.

29:57.523 --> 29:59.132
Be careful, Li.

30:17.151 --> 30:18.736
How have you been?

30:19.742 --> 30:21.202
Never better. You?

30:21.479 --> 30:23.655
No complaints.

30:26.048 --> 30:27.961
What can I do for you?

30:29.077 --> 30:31.348
I came to say good-bye.

30:31.374 --> 30:34.916
I plan to restore what my
father has taken from us.

30:34.942 --> 30:37.061
So, that's what all
this has been about

30:37.087 --> 30:38.588
from the beginning?

30:39.334 --> 30:41.423
Reclaiming your birthright?

30:42.475 --> 30:43.475
Yes.

30:44.170 --> 30:45.594
Freedom from exile

30:46.865 --> 30:48.420
for all of us.

30:49.571 --> 30:51.045
Then we go home.

30:52.194 --> 30:54.311
What makes you think
I want to go back?

30:54.779 --> 30:57.193
I've got everything
I need right here.

30:59.232 --> 31:02.778
Why would I throw it away to
go back to a broken land,

31:03.553 --> 31:05.506
face countless enemies?

31:05.608 --> 31:07.694
Heck, no.

31:08.116 --> 31:11.161
War is a young man's game.

31:11.936 --> 31:14.428
Yes, but it is a game of strategy

31:14.594 --> 31:18.608
where good players use
technical instincts,

31:18.884 --> 31:20.761
a sense of what's likely

31:21.569 --> 31:23.287
or possible,

31:24.221 --> 31:27.098
and what's not worthy is discarded.

31:29.373 --> 31:31.903
In chess, the rules are fixed,

31:32.552 --> 31:35.069
but the outcome is unpredictable.

31:35.519 --> 31:39.565
Inexperienced players
often fear the knight.

31:39.606 --> 31:44.194
Its characteristics are
"compel respect."

31:44.748 --> 31:46.488
Occasionally,

31:46.764 --> 31:49.725
it surprises even the
most weary player.

31:52.118 --> 31:55.342
My father is of no concern to me.

31:56.831 --> 31:59.016
In all probability, he's dead by now.

31:59.042 --> 32:01.234
By his legacy remains.

32:01.943 --> 32:04.655
The atrocities that he
and Simone committed

32:04.930 --> 32:07.249
cannot simply be erased.

32:07.863 --> 32:09.678
You see what can be gained,

32:09.720 --> 32:12.731
but have you considered
what can be lost?

32:13.817 --> 32:16.226
And even if you manage to get back,

32:16.268 --> 32:20.272
without your father's blessings,
you can never repay his debt.

32:21.152 --> 32:23.535
It's a noble, worthy

32:24.315 --> 32:25.824
gesture, Rhyis,

32:27.097 --> 32:29.137
but an impossible one.

32:47.228 --> 32:48.900
Good luck, son.

33:25.168 --> 33:27.278
Um, n... n-n-n-no.

33:27.304 --> 33:29.134
Do not do this to me tonight.

33:29.160 --> 33:30.843
Come on, come on.

33:30.884 --> 33:32.970
Shit. Wow.

33:50.320 --> 33:52.322
Ooh. Ooh.

33:53.949 --> 33:56.034
Excuse me!

34:03.627 --> 34:04.705
Hey.

34:04.779 --> 34:06.119
Thank you.

34:06.211 --> 34:07.284
Um...

34:07.362 --> 34:09.297
My car, it just broke down,

34:09.339 --> 34:11.299
and I hoping I could
get a ride real quick.

34:11.341 --> 34:14.103
I know you don't know me, but I-I
only live one district away,

34:14.130 --> 34:17.014
and it doesn't look
like you're in a hurry.

34:17.054 --> 34:19.139
It'll only take a second.

34:23.514 --> 34:24.728
Please.

34:25.005 --> 34:26.297
It's cold.

34:26.324 --> 34:27.581
Help a sister out.

34:27.607 --> 34:28.917
Thank you.

34:31.659 --> 34:34.239
It's like being on two
different planets with that guy.

34:34.280 --> 34:36.282
It's like one minute he
wants to be with me,

34:36.324 --> 34:38.784
and then the next, he's
saying stuff to piss me off.

34:38.827 --> 34:40.829
And he still pretends to care.

34:42.867 --> 34:46.428
God forbid I interrupt one of
his stupid basketball games.

34:47.197 --> 34:48.907
Trying to have a real conversation,

34:49.252 --> 34:51.047
something substantial.

34:51.293 --> 34:52.424
God, I swear,

34:52.465 --> 34:54.344
I don't even know why I
put up with him so long.

34:56.428 --> 34:57.804
Oh, your mind's wasted.

34:57.846 --> 34:59.097
Vincent.

34:59.138 --> 35:01.224
This time, I'm seriously done.

35:01.266 --> 35:02.919
I think.

35:02.945 --> 35:05.849
Why... why are we pulling over?

35:06.438 --> 35:08.147
I'm still a few blocks away, sir.

35:08.189 --> 35:10.233
Shut up.

35:10.275 --> 35:12.110
You're pathetic.

35:12.151 --> 35:14.145
All you little girls are the same,

35:14.171 --> 35:16.716
running around bitching and moaning,

35:16.786 --> 35:19.008
waiting for some
less-than-average man

35:19.034 --> 35:20.953
to validate your existence.

35:20.994 --> 35:23.830
If this is what you intend to
be about ten years from now,

35:23.872 --> 35:25.832
then I suggest you go home,

35:25.874 --> 35:27.751
you choose the best dress

35:27.793 --> 35:30.253
from whatever bargain
basement you shop in.

35:30.295 --> 35:32.047
Go out on the town,

35:32.089 --> 35:35.050
find a complete stranger
to have your way with,

35:35.092 --> 35:38.247
and then take this gun,
put it in your mouth,

35:38.645 --> 35:42.390
wrap your lips around it
and pull the trigger.

35:43.270 --> 35:46.394
'Cause it's better to be
dead than be what you are-

35:46.436 --> 35:49.606
a disgrace to your own persuasion.

35:49.773 --> 35:51.849
Get out.

35:57.155 --> 35:59.324
I don't want to be like this anymore.

36:01.785 --> 36:03.829
I want to be different.

36:07.165 --> 36:09.250
Tell me how to be different.

36:17.480 --> 36:21.943
Be at this address, 9:00 a.m.
sharp tomorrow morning.

36:22.093 --> 36:24.554
Do not be late.

36:25.954 --> 36:27.998
If you're serious about
wanting to make a change,

36:28.024 --> 36:30.018
I'm willing to offer it to you.

36:30.175 --> 36:33.690
But you must make the
decision on your own.

36:34.192 --> 36:36.277
The walk home will do you some good,

36:36.319 --> 36:38.393
give you time to think.

36:39.543 --> 36:42.393
Keep the gun for protection.

37:16.164 --> 37:17.819
<i>There are moments in time</i>

37:17.861 --> 37:20.279
<i>when a man must choose his own path.</i>

37:20.321 --> 37:22.240
<i>And I had chosen mine.</i>

37:23.054 --> 37:24.534
<i>I quickly outgrew the council</i>

37:24.576 --> 37:27.829
<i>of old men and looked
toward the future.</i>

37:27.871 --> 37:30.540
<i>Knowing that no matter what the cost,</i>

37:30.582 --> 37:32.992
<i>my brothers would follow.</i>

37:34.502 --> 37:36.295
<i>We were kings</i>

37:36.337 --> 37:39.883
<i>forging an empire built
primarily on three things-</i>

37:39.917 --> 37:41.515
<i>power...</i>

37:42.677 --> 37:44.328
<i>respect...</i>

37:45.097 --> 37:46.305
<i>and loyalty.</i>

37:49.539 --> 37:50.614
Hey, breh?

37:50.640 --> 37:52.146
I'm gonna take this
phone call real quick.

37:52.171 --> 37:54.187
I'll meet you downstairs.

38:35.279 --> 38:37.130
So, what the deal?

38:37.499 --> 38:39.460
What's up with the big celebration?

38:39.517 --> 38:41.144
For ten years,

38:41.841 --> 38:43.571
we have worked under

38:43.613 --> 38:45.490
the Costa syndicate.

38:46.099 --> 38:49.130
And the reason that
we are here today...

38:49.215 --> 38:50.799
we are on the verge

38:51.412 --> 38:53.154
of running the whole shit.

38:53.825 --> 38:55.667
Why?

38:55.989 --> 38:58.825
Because we held each other down.

39:00.880 --> 39:02.872
I want to make a toast.

39:04.091 --> 39:06.083
To my bredren.

39:09.130 --> 39:11.285
<i>Salut Mon frère.</i>

39:11.888 --> 39:14.138
That's what's up, big bro.

39:14.575 --> 39:15.770
But what's the big news?

39:15.812 --> 39:17.330
I mean, I know you didn't
call us all the way down here

39:17.355 --> 39:18.790
to tell us that we got
each other's backs.

39:18.815 --> 39:20.233
Nah.

39:20.275 --> 39:22.777
I spoke to the old man today.

39:23.365 --> 39:25.763
He expressed his gratitude

39:26.114 --> 39:28.615
for everything that we've been doing.

39:28.641 --> 39:32.269
But he also mentioned expansion.

39:32.295 --> 39:33.630
"Expansion"?

39:33.997 --> 39:35.581
Let me, uh, say it

39:35.623 --> 39:38.013
a little less... eloquently.

39:39.796 --> 39:43.574
Angelo is stepping the fuck down.

39:43.614 --> 39:46.271
And he's giving me the entire shit.

39:46.600 --> 39:48.220
Get the fuck out of here!

39:48.261 --> 39:50.263
Are you serious?!

39:51.931 --> 39:53.574
See, that's what I'm
talking about, cat daddy!

39:53.599 --> 39:54.559
Congratulations, man!

39:54.600 --> 39:55.685
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

39:55.727 --> 39:57.241
So, how'd it go down?

39:57.267 --> 39:58.827
I mean, how did it happen?

39:58.853 --> 40:00.230
Why you?

40:00.718 --> 40:02.317
I mean...

40:02.359 --> 40:03.818
I'm just saying why didn't he choose

40:03.860 --> 40:06.154
his son Nick or somebody like that?

40:06.596 --> 40:08.614
He has his own reasons.

40:08.861 --> 40:10.369
Personal mainly.

40:11.336 --> 40:13.296
But be that as it may,

40:13.322 --> 40:14.854
come tomorrow,

40:14.947 --> 40:17.994
I will be the first
black man in history

40:18.682 --> 40:20.877
to run an Italian syndicate.

40:21.205 --> 40:22.461
I don't like it.

40:22.768 --> 40:25.072
More power, more situations.

40:25.729 --> 40:27.440
I mean, shit like this...

40:27.466 --> 40:28.815
It just don't feel right, Rhyis.

40:28.843 --> 40:30.611
Shit, I say we move on it.

40:30.887 --> 40:32.638
I mean,
you spilled blood for the old man.

40:32.680 --> 40:34.541
Shit, we all did.

40:35.276 --> 40:38.270
I mean, come on, man, this
shit is long overdue.

40:38.783 --> 40:40.230
All right, don't get me wrong now.

40:41.104 --> 40:42.648
We can't go forth with this

40:42.690 --> 40:44.330
without expecting some
blowback from Nick

40:44.359 --> 40:46.307
and the rest of the cartels.

40:46.940 --> 40:48.703
We should expect nothing less.

40:48.729 --> 40:49.533
Look...

40:49.562 --> 40:51.673
I'm not saying that we
shouldn't consider this.

40:51.699 --> 40:53.576
I'm just saying that, you know,

40:53.618 --> 40:57.460
maybe we...
maybe you should just sit back,

40:57.486 --> 40:59.578
take a little time and
think this through.

40:59.604 --> 41:00.917
It is already

41:00.959 --> 41:02.049
done.

41:03.893 --> 41:05.297
Now...

41:05.338 --> 41:06.798
we stick tight.

41:06.839 --> 41:09.260
We watch each other's back.

41:09.286 --> 41:10.788
And I promise

41:11.386 --> 41:13.119
in due time...

41:13.888 --> 41:15.432
our plans

41:15.863 --> 41:17.709
will be revealed.

41:18.268 --> 41:19.889
Pardon me.

41:24.399 --> 41:27.277
They took to the shit
like babies to bathwater.

41:29.889 --> 41:31.678
Yeah.

41:31.986 --> 41:33.583
Thanks, Pop.

41:34.818 --> 41:36.786
Yeah, I appreciate that.

41:36.828 --> 41:38.471
Uh...
yeah, I'm gonna have

41:38.496 --> 41:40.420
to get back to you on that.

41:41.404 --> 41:43.209
Yeah, all right.

41:43.469 --> 41:45.364
Take care.

41:48.673 --> 41:50.763
Business.

41:52.365 --> 41:53.928
Yeah.

41:54.491 --> 41:56.326
Yeah, um...

41:56.555 --> 41:58.199
you know, just a buyer
having second thoughts

41:58.224 --> 42:00.232
about the price point.

42:01.853 --> 42:04.076
Ain't nothing I can't handle.

42:11.112 --> 42:13.388
Remember the first night

42:13.680 --> 42:15.932
you came out on the block with me?

42:16.717 --> 42:18.619
Hell yeah.

42:19.020 --> 42:20.829
15 years old.

42:20.997 --> 42:24.498
I tried to keep you
from following me.

42:26.098 --> 42:27.933
But you wouldn't listen.

42:27.959 --> 42:30.882
Even back then you had
a mind of your own.

42:31.560 --> 42:33.951
So I gave you a strap

42:34.717 --> 42:36.221
and I said...

42:37.099 --> 42:39.724
"Leave fear and hesitation
where you stand.

42:40.623 --> 42:42.143
"If you follow, do so

42:42.185 --> 42:44.287
as a man ready to die."

42:44.770 --> 42:47.065
15 years, you did not hesitate,

42:47.091 --> 42:49.913
not for one split second.

42:50.857 --> 42:52.529
But just now...

42:52.763 --> 42:56.115
when I asked you who
was on the phone...

42:56.830 --> 42:58.656
you did.

43:01.579 --> 43:03.540
Breh, I didn't.

43:04.414 --> 43:06.167
Things are gonna get a little tight

43:06.209 --> 43:08.169
around here.

43:08.211 --> 43:10.961
Angelo decided to step down.

43:11.506 --> 43:14.133
And I am gonna have to depend

43:14.175 --> 43:18.375
on you and the rest of the Set
to keep shit stitched up.

43:18.401 --> 43:20.039
Rhyis.

43:22.633 --> 43:24.930
I promise you...

43:25.183 --> 43:29.187
there was nothing irregular
about that conversation, breh.

43:29.885 --> 43:32.961
Everything is good.

43:33.923 --> 43:37.368
And you know I got
your back like always.

43:37.813 --> 43:39.030
No question.

43:39.056 --> 43:42.225
That's the third time
that you denied it.

43:45.247 --> 43:47.640
No kiss on the cheek, brother?

43:53.424 --> 43:56.045
You've been a salesman for too long.

43:58.209 --> 44:00.170
That hustle...

44:01.823 --> 44:03.936
that's for the customers.

44:06.769 --> 44:08.438
You give me a call when you're ready

44:08.480 --> 44:09.772
to cut through the bullshit

44:09.814 --> 44:12.076
and tell me what's really going on.

44:13.387 --> 44:14.990
Hmm?

44:25.704 --> 44:26.747
Why you so shy?

44:26.789 --> 44:27.915
I'm not shy.

44:27.957 --> 44:29.000
She is not shy.

44:29.041 --> 44:31.292
She's seems shy.
Don't let her play you.

44:31.377 --> 44:33.296
- Oh.
- It works. Don't hate.

44:33.338 --> 44:35.340
See, I like this right here.

44:35.404 --> 44:38.792
It's like a two on one. Really?

44:38.884 --> 44:40.277
Yeah.

44:44.840 --> 44:46.601
Yo, where the fuck
is he going, man?

44:46.643 --> 44:48.415
We just got here.

44:54.066 --> 44:55.692
<i>Excusez-moi.</i>

44:56.062 --> 44:57.564
Oh, oh!

45:01.761 --> 45:03.751
Now, give me a kiss.

46:03.886 --> 46:05.606
...and they go out
to the living room,

46:05.638 --> 46:08.182
so all the stockings, they're
hung up on the chimney.

46:08.224 --> 46:10.055
- Hey, yo.
- Right?

46:11.686 --> 46:14.462
Hey, Pop.

46:15.415 --> 46:17.567
Come in.

46:18.188 --> 46:20.612
Uh, if I, uh,

46:20.653 --> 46:22.630
knew you were coming, I'd
have cleaned the joint up.

46:22.655 --> 46:24.090
- Can I get you something?
- No, I'm fine.

46:24.115 --> 46:26.033
- You want... anything?
- Yes.

46:26.075 --> 46:27.759
What is this?

46:28.620 --> 46:31.423
Is this what you do with
the money you make?

46:31.479 --> 46:32.897
Not all of it.

46:33.047 --> 46:34.617
No.

46:34.805 --> 46:37.545
I'm working on some, uh, some...
some big things.

46:37.587 --> 46:39.255
Big plans.

46:39.297 --> 46:41.966
And, uh, you know, with
your condition and all,

46:42.007 --> 46:43.579
I-I figure you're gonna be

46:43.605 --> 46:45.525
stepping down pretty soon,
so I'd better start

46:45.551 --> 46:47.137
planning ahead, right?

46:47.430 --> 46:49.848
I have some things I need
to discuss with you.

46:50.134 --> 46:51.892
Important things.

46:51.934 --> 46:53.227
Alone.

46:53.269 --> 46:55.008
Ladies, let's go.

46:55.034 --> 46:56.481
- Let's go.
- What?

46:56.522 --> 46:57.690
Go ahead.

46:57.732 --> 47:00.234
Excuse me?

47:18.390 --> 47:19.891
You're right.

47:20.277 --> 47:22.633
I will be stepping down.

47:23.040 --> 47:26.469
I suppose I don't have any
choice in the matter though.

47:26.884 --> 47:29.054
Rhyis will be taking my place.

47:29.096 --> 47:30.602
- Not you.
- What?

47:30.628 --> 47:33.110
I know it's hard for you
to accept right now,

47:33.180 --> 47:35.071
but he's more suited to lead.

47:35.134 --> 47:37.068
He's been with me
every step of the way

47:37.094 --> 47:38.289
and he knows how to get things done.

47:38.314 --> 47:39.774
And I don't?

47:39.816 --> 47:42.527
Order has to be maintained.

47:42.568 --> 47:45.696
That's the only way this
organization's gonna survive

47:45.759 --> 47:46.656
when I'm gone.

47:46.698 --> 47:48.700
This "order" that you speak of

47:48.741 --> 47:51.243
is a fucking illusion, Pop!

47:53.204 --> 47:55.498
What, you think because you
hide behind these rules

47:55.540 --> 47:58.102
it somehow makes you honorable?

47:58.376 --> 48:00.935
What kind of man turns
his back on his own son?

48:00.961 --> 48:02.588
You brought this on yourself.

48:02.630 --> 48:05.842
I tried to teach you, but
you wouldn't listen.

48:05.882 --> 48:09.053
How can I trust you with, with
any kind of responsibility

48:09.094 --> 48:12.813
when you can't carry
out one single order?

48:13.149 --> 48:15.083
You trust me because...

48:16.039 --> 48:18.541
I'm your flesh and blood.

48:22.781 --> 48:26.087
You know... the other bosses?

48:26.445 --> 48:28.829
They laugh behind your back.

48:29.462 --> 48:30.783
Yeah.

48:31.602 --> 48:34.245
They laugh at the shell of
a man that you've become.

48:34.286 --> 48:36.259
Everyone knows it.

48:37.998 --> 48:41.157
You lost your balls a long time ago,
Pop.

48:41.235 --> 48:42.938
But I haven't.

48:43.688 --> 48:46.131
If you ain't willing to give
me what's rightfully mine,

48:46.173 --> 48:48.923
might as well be dead to you.

48:49.802 --> 48:52.054
Then consider yourself dead to me

48:52.096 --> 48:55.204
because you're not getting my spot.

48:55.230 --> 48:58.048
Rhyis will be giving you your orders.

48:59.598 --> 49:01.641
Deal with it.

49:11.769 --> 49:13.298
Sit.

49:17.274 --> 49:18.696
You made it.

49:19.540 --> 49:22.668
The suspense must have been
killing you, no doubt.

49:23.079 --> 49:26.360
I guess, um, I was curious.

49:26.962 --> 49:30.134
I have never seen a woman so strong

49:30.635 --> 49:33.011
and obviously in control.

49:33.360 --> 49:35.532
Hold your head up straight.

49:35.860 --> 49:39.644
Never lower your eyes
to me or anyone else.

49:40.087 --> 49:42.229
It's a clear sign of brokenness,

49:42.271 --> 49:44.315
and, quite frankly, it
makes me uncomfortable.

49:44.356 --> 49:46.509
I'm sorry, I'll try not to...

49:46.548 --> 49:47.790
Do.

49:47.816 --> 49:51.235
"Trying"
is a word invented by the weak.

49:52.156 --> 49:55.845
In any case, it's not your
fault you're this ignorant.

49:56.368 --> 49:57.912
It's your mother's.

49:58.649 --> 50:01.212
You're a product of your upbringing.

50:01.238 --> 50:03.208
You were born into an era

50:03.250 --> 50:06.917
where men have neatly defined
your existence as a woman.

50:06.972 --> 50:09.339
And you embrace it with open arms.

50:09.365 --> 50:13.894
No disrespect, miss, but you
don't know anything about me.

50:13.928 --> 50:16.180
Are you always this
disgustingly apologetic

50:16.221 --> 50:19.480
before you speak your mind?

50:19.613 --> 50:22.115
I never filter my response to anyone,

50:22.478 --> 50:24.062
because I don't have to.

50:24.104 --> 50:26.899
I do what I want to do
when I want to do it

50:26.941 --> 50:29.318
and with whom I want to do it with.

50:29.666 --> 50:32.168
I own everything that you see here,

50:32.194 --> 50:34.183
and I take what I want.

50:35.613 --> 50:37.910
I'm offering you the same.

50:38.452 --> 50:39.574
Uh, like, what?

50:39.600 --> 50:40.691
Uh, a job?

50:40.717 --> 50:43.206
It's more like a lifestyle.

50:43.650 --> 50:46.042
Wealth, power

50:46.316 --> 50:49.894
and, most of all, respect.

50:53.232 --> 50:55.610
You don't have to live
this way any longer,

50:56.284 --> 51:01.065
like an empty cup waiting for
someone else to fill it.

51:02.750 --> 51:05.430
Do you still have the
weapon that I gave to you?

51:05.456 --> 51:06.647
Yes.

51:06.689 --> 51:10.417
Vincent will explain all that
you need to know for now.

51:10.456 --> 51:12.778
And if you make it out of here alive,

51:12.820 --> 51:15.322
I'll take it as a yes.

51:55.821 --> 51:58.032
- What?
- Hey, breh.

51:59.742 --> 52:00.952
It's me, man.

52:00.993 --> 52:03.212
Look... um...

52:04.705 --> 52:06.457
I just want to apologize

52:06.498 --> 52:08.305
for last night, man.

52:09.251 --> 52:10.920
It was cause for celebration

52:10.962 --> 52:12.546
and I ruined it.

52:12.588 --> 52:14.805
And I'm-I'm sorry.

52:14.837 --> 52:16.899
I mean, I can hear that
you're feeling better.

52:16.949 --> 52:19.649
- Hell, I mean, at least she is.
- Get to the point, Khalil.

52:19.675 --> 52:20.797
Easy.

52:20.823 --> 52:22.180
Okay, man, look.

52:22.222 --> 52:23.432
It's Pop.

52:23.474 --> 52:24.683
He's here,

52:24.725 --> 52:25.935
in the city.

52:25.977 --> 52:27.311
What? You mean Angelo?

52:27.352 --> 52:29.519
No, man, Knight. Our real father.

52:29.545 --> 52:31.331
He's the one who's
been supplying our guns

52:31.356 --> 52:33.415
- since the beginning.
- Stop. Stop.

52:33.441 --> 52:36.168
Look, man, I've been working
for him for a while now.

52:36.194 --> 52:38.697
I've been doing some
real serious deals, man.

52:38.739 --> 52:41.157
I'm talking black Wall
Street level deals, breh.

52:41.199 --> 52:43.327
What the fuck is wrong with you?

52:43.368 --> 52:44.595
Have we not had this conversation

52:44.620 --> 52:46.371
more times than none? I told you

52:46.413 --> 52:48.724
- to watch for him, if he ever...
- Yeah... yeah, I know, man,

52:48.749 --> 52:50.626
but Th-this is our father, man.

52:50.668 --> 52:52.019
Look, man, I thought that you would

52:52.044 --> 52:53.704
be happy that he's around now.

52:57.659 --> 52:58.994
...Knight.

53:04.765 --> 53:06.642
You don't know him.

53:06.684 --> 53:08.477
You don't know anything about him.

53:08.519 --> 53:11.150
I'm telling you for your own good,

53:11.176 --> 53:12.803
stay away from him.

53:12.991 --> 53:15.035
I was supposed to
meet him in an hour.

53:15.218 --> 53:16.636
Yeah, no, he owns a restaurant

53:16.662 --> 53:18.664
somewhere in the northern district.

53:18.988 --> 53:20.614
Send me the address

53:20.656 --> 53:22.908
and stay put until I get back.

53:22.950 --> 53:25.077
And no matter what,

53:25.119 --> 53:27.674
don't reach out to
him for any reason.

53:27.814 --> 53:29.440
Understood?

53:29.623 --> 53:30.958
Okay.

53:34.555 --> 53:35.962
Shit.

54:53.296 --> 54:54.756
My son.

54:55.196 --> 54:57.158
It's been far too long.

54:57.750 --> 54:59.143
May I...

54:59.246 --> 55:01.705
offer you something to eat?

55:01.861 --> 55:05.463
20 years since you walked
out on my brother and I.

55:06.509 --> 55:08.929
Left my mother alone to die.

55:08.955 --> 55:10.206
And all you can offer me

55:10.232 --> 55:12.066
is some pain Au de café?

55:19.524 --> 55:21.610
Your mother used to say that to me.

55:22.128 --> 55:23.337
It meant,

55:23.822 --> 55:25.588
when our time comes,

55:25.654 --> 55:27.196
we must embrace it fully.

55:27.269 --> 55:30.272
What the fuck are you doing here?

55:30.619 --> 55:32.447
Last time I heard,

55:32.473 --> 55:36.227
you was running from some
small-time boys in Haiti.

55:36.580 --> 55:39.189
I run from no one.

55:40.012 --> 55:41.463
It was merely a means

55:41.505 --> 55:45.379
to keep you and your brother safe.

55:46.575 --> 55:48.470
But I felt it was my duty

55:48.512 --> 55:50.388
to protect my family.

55:50.848 --> 55:51.981
Was it not?

55:52.007 --> 55:55.262
Since when have you been
concerned with family?

55:57.327 --> 55:59.788
All this time,
I thought that you were

56:00.055 --> 56:02.015
a selfish, black-hearted

56:02.629 --> 56:04.161
bastard.

56:04.187 --> 56:07.731
And it comes to find out you as
sympathetic as the rest of us.

56:07.757 --> 56:10.309
Despite what you may think of me,

56:12.217 --> 56:14.191
I'm still your father, Rhyis.

56:14.217 --> 56:16.497
I'm still Papa.

56:17.434 --> 56:21.027
I believe a greater show
of respect is in order.

56:21.053 --> 56:22.931
Respect is earned.

56:23.379 --> 56:25.341
I'm not giving you any.

56:25.381 --> 56:27.309
Who do you think

56:27.335 --> 56:29.964
put you in the position
you are in today?

56:30.262 --> 56:32.931
How do you think you were
able to move up the ranks

56:32.973 --> 56:36.137
in Angelo Costa's
organization so quickly?

56:41.033 --> 56:43.489
It has been by my hand.

56:44.578 --> 56:46.075
Not your own.

56:47.107 --> 56:48.608
Not of your doing.

56:48.634 --> 56:50.512
That's pathetic.

56:51.027 --> 56:52.942
Even for you.

56:53.994 --> 56:55.645
You sit there

56:56.337 --> 56:58.464
and you try to take credit

56:58.874 --> 57:00.919
for the moves that I made

57:00.945 --> 57:02.848
to cement this business,

57:02.874 --> 57:06.086
and after we've grown up
and I'm running shit,

57:07.147 --> 57:10.276
you want to snake your
way back into our lives

57:10.302 --> 57:14.139
by using Khalil to make you rich.

57:14.181 --> 57:15.981
Is that about right?

57:16.438 --> 57:19.357
I understand your resentment to me...

57:20.557 --> 57:23.852
...in some instances, it may
even be warranted, but...

57:44.461 --> 57:46.922
I am not your son.

57:48.822 --> 57:51.731
As far as I'm concerned,
I'm your enemy.

57:52.707 --> 57:55.284
So if I hear that you crossed a line

57:55.310 --> 57:57.479
and interfered with my family,

57:57.846 --> 57:59.817
I will not hesitate

57:59.843 --> 58:01.220
to pull the trigger

58:01.637 --> 58:04.106
and dead you right where you sit.

58:22.486 --> 58:23.654
Angelo?

58:23.680 --> 58:25.099
No.

58:26.383 --> 58:27.606
No, no,

58:27.632 --> 58:29.794
No, Angelo!

58:33.772 --> 58:36.098
No. No.

58:46.731 --> 58:49.485
- Bonjour.
- Bonjour.

58:58.952 --> 59:01.447
Bonjour, bonjour.

59:01.473 --> 59:03.516
Bonjour, monsieur.

59:27.147 --> 59:30.036
Li! What the fuck you doing here?

59:31.588 --> 59:33.173
The fuck is this?

59:35.197 --> 59:36.388
What's up?

59:36.414 --> 59:37.958
I am done.

59:37.984 --> 59:39.951
She is your responsibility now,

59:39.982 --> 59:41.635
- just like before.
- Nah, nah.

59:41.661 --> 59:43.263
Li, Li, I can't... I don't
have time for this right now.

59:43.288 --> 59:44.021
I can't do it.

59:44.047 --> 59:45.890
I don't have room for anybody else.

59:45.916 --> 59:47.125
I can't do this right now, Li.

59:47.167 --> 59:48.502
- You gotta take her.
- I'm sorry!

59:48.544 --> 59:51.296
I can't do a goddamn thing with her.

59:51.747 --> 59:54.622
You're the only
one she ever listens to

59:54.648 --> 59:56.068
and you know it.

59:58.720 --> 01:00:00.680
I'm trusting you,

01:00:00.722 --> 01:00:03.892
so don't let me down.

01:00:03.934 --> 01:00:05.685
Li, look, I-I can't right now.

01:00:05.711 --> 01:00:07.287
Li! Li, Li!

01:00:07.313 --> 01:00:08.857
Stop playing!

01:00:09.137 --> 01:00:10.380
Li!

01:00:15.096 --> 01:00:16.388
All right, get up, Soo.

01:00:19.036 --> 01:00:21.706
I told you to stop
messing with that stuff.

01:00:33.661 --> 01:00:35.372
I trust you're settled in.

01:00:36.060 --> 01:00:37.396
I am.

01:00:37.678 --> 01:00:39.912
Not that I had... much choice.

01:00:41.954 --> 01:00:43.849
There's always a choice.

01:00:43.875 --> 01:00:46.185
The difficulty lies in
knowing which one to make

01:00:46.211 --> 01:00:48.588
without knowing what the
consequences will be.

01:00:49.271 --> 01:00:52.537
Did Vincent explain to
you what a "fixer" is?

01:00:52.644 --> 01:00:54.482
A person who fixes things

01:00:54.508 --> 01:00:56.271
by eliminating them.

01:00:57.112 --> 01:00:58.572
I was 16

01:00:58.614 --> 01:01:01.533
when I completed my first assignment.

01:01:01.575 --> 01:01:03.037
They were mostly political,

01:01:03.063 --> 01:01:05.333
paid for by the Haitian government.

01:01:05.370 --> 01:01:08.540
But now,
they're of a more personal nature.

01:01:10.177 --> 01:01:12.127
This weapon belonged to me.

01:01:12.169 --> 01:01:13.962
I expect for you to handle it

01:01:14.004 --> 01:01:16.548
- with care.
- I will.

01:01:16.590 --> 01:01:17.747
I will.

01:01:18.833 --> 01:01:20.840
I have a job for you.

01:01:21.428 --> 01:01:24.640
It pays $250,000,

01:01:24.681 --> 01:01:26.287
half up front

01:01:26.313 --> 01:01:29.180
and half when the
assignment is complete.

01:01:29.364 --> 01:01:31.907
Wow, that... sounds great,

01:01:32.555 --> 01:01:33.773
but I'm not ready.

01:01:33.815 --> 01:01:35.526
I-I don't even know
how to hold a gun.

01:01:35.567 --> 01:01:37.008
Don't worry.

01:01:37.047 --> 01:01:38.487
If you're a quick study,

01:01:38.529 --> 01:01:40.155
that's more than enough time.

01:01:40.197 --> 01:01:41.781
Have the rifle assembled

01:01:41.823 --> 01:01:43.617
and ready within an hour.

01:01:43.890 --> 01:01:45.683
We'll begin immediately.

01:01:50.538 --> 01:01:52.706
Best get to work.

01:01:56.180 --> 01:01:57.836
"...your head." He says, "Head?

01:01:57.862 --> 01:01:59.078
I couldn't find the head."

01:02:02.317 --> 01:02:03.818
Gentlemen.

01:02:03.970 --> 01:02:05.639
Hate to interrupt

01:02:05.681 --> 01:02:07.359
such a festive occasion,

01:02:07.755 --> 01:02:09.132
but some of you might have heard

01:02:09.158 --> 01:02:11.055
that my father's dead.

01:02:12.896 --> 01:02:15.982
Now, he told me,
effective immediately,

01:02:16.024 --> 01:02:17.442
he planned on shutting down

01:02:17.484 --> 01:02:20.352
the dealings of all
munitions in our district.

01:02:20.848 --> 01:02:23.644
Planned on taking the
organization in a new direction.

01:02:25.373 --> 01:02:27.741
Now, I can only assume

01:02:27.781 --> 01:02:29.820
that those who killed him

01:02:30.493 --> 01:02:32.227
had the most to lose.

01:02:34.348 --> 01:02:37.309
I don't got to spell it out for you,
do I?

01:02:38.412 --> 01:02:40.205
Now, he's dead.

01:02:41.438 --> 01:02:44.586
So whatever hedge of protection

01:02:44.612 --> 01:02:48.408
my father placed over
Rhyis and his crew

01:02:48.682 --> 01:02:50.758
is null and void.

01:02:51.711 --> 01:02:54.161
I'm asking you, humbly,

01:02:54.844 --> 01:02:56.270
for your blessing

01:02:56.296 --> 01:02:58.548
and manpower to take him out.

01:03:01.570 --> 01:03:04.020
If Angelo's boys really did kill him,

01:03:04.640 --> 01:03:06.517
he brought it on himself.

01:03:06.880 --> 01:03:08.614
He got sloppy.

01:03:09.563 --> 01:03:12.106
Put his trust in the wrong people.

01:03:12.138 --> 01:03:14.372
Forgot where his loyalties lay.

01:03:15.645 --> 01:03:17.544
You should've stepped
in a long time ago

01:03:17.586 --> 01:03:19.466
and sat your old man down.

01:03:19.858 --> 01:03:21.981
Maybe he'd still be alive.

01:03:23.121 --> 01:03:24.638
Maybe not.

01:03:24.952 --> 01:03:28.164
I can understand your
feelings on this matter, Feris.

01:03:28.872 --> 01:03:31.817
But whatever misunderstanding
you may or may not have had

01:03:31.843 --> 01:03:33.719
with my old man...

01:03:33.854 --> 01:03:35.273
it's done.

01:03:37.500 --> 01:03:39.691
I'm offering you a chance to help me

01:03:39.733 --> 01:03:42.078
make this thing right for both of us.

01:03:42.553 --> 01:03:43.953
I don't like it.

01:03:45.322 --> 01:03:47.157
We can't make drastic decisions

01:03:47.198 --> 01:03:49.320
based on facts that we don't know.

01:03:49.453 --> 01:03:51.602
That's not the way things are done.

01:03:51.628 --> 01:03:55.586
Besides, these Haitians,
they're fucking savages.

01:03:55.749 --> 01:03:58.918
I mean, they wiped out Feris's
men, sombreros and all,

01:03:58.960 --> 01:04:01.070
in less than ten minutes flat.

01:04:01.921 --> 01:04:03.881
War? War?

01:04:03.923 --> 01:04:05.906
They fucking love war.

01:04:06.405 --> 01:04:10.437
And war is bad for business,
gentlemen.

01:04:11.055 --> 01:04:13.433
Now, look, it's a shame
what happened to Angelo.

01:04:13.475 --> 01:04:15.023
A real shame.

01:04:15.935 --> 01:04:17.813
But the truth of the matter is-

01:04:18.182 --> 01:04:20.883
we cannot do anything about that now.

01:04:21.074 --> 01:04:22.812
He's right.

01:04:23.675 --> 01:04:25.257
The kid's right.

01:04:27.155 --> 01:04:29.281
We owe it to him.

01:04:29.556 --> 01:04:31.599
We owe it to ourselves.

01:04:34.230 --> 01:04:37.961
I know there's some of you who...
didn't agree

01:04:37.987 --> 01:04:41.805
on how Angelo ran his district,
but that's beside the point.

01:04:44.529 --> 01:04:46.664
This is about principle,

01:04:48.318 --> 01:04:49.977
about respect.

01:04:51.988 --> 01:04:56.368
It's about preserving
everything we've built...

01:04:59.229 --> 01:05:01.314
...everything we stand for.

01:05:03.472 --> 01:05:05.308
Order must be restored.

01:05:05.764 --> 01:05:09.254
Otherwise,
we lose face with our associates

01:05:09.280 --> 01:05:11.336
in the international market.

01:05:12.728 --> 01:05:16.232
You do what you got to
do to make things right.

01:05:16.697 --> 01:05:18.741
Take whatever you need.

01:05:22.686 --> 01:05:24.313
<i>A salute.</i>

01:05:24.921 --> 01:05:26.641
- To Angelo.
- To Angelo.

01:05:26.798 --> 01:05:29.141
- To Angelo.
- Angelo.

01:05:29.732 --> 01:05:31.692
Pour me some.

01:05:32.819 --> 01:05:34.571
<i>Salute.</i>

01:05:37.317 --> 01:05:38.818
Thank you.

01:05:56.574 --> 01:05:58.535
Do you know why she brought me here?

01:05:59.163 --> 01:06:01.617
Yeah, out of mutual respect.

01:06:01.643 --> 01:06:04.229
She thought it'd be cool
for you to come here,

01:06:04.312 --> 01:06:07.231
think things through,
clear your head.

01:06:07.547 --> 01:06:09.821
You know I'm the only one
she trusts around you.

01:06:10.775 --> 01:06:12.430
That's not it.

01:06:12.878 --> 01:06:14.963
It's because she doesn't care.

01:06:16.681 --> 01:06:20.336
She won't answer my phone,
she won't return my calls.

01:06:21.834 --> 01:06:23.789
She hates me now.

01:06:24.648 --> 01:06:28.602
Ah, she don't hate you.
She's just pissed.

01:06:30.194 --> 01:06:32.196
But, you know, I can't blame her,

01:06:32.238 --> 01:06:34.783
because you have been doing some
fucked up shit lately, Soo.

01:06:35.218 --> 01:06:38.237
I didn't mean for things
to turn out this way.

01:06:39.579 --> 01:06:41.042
I was only trying to forget

01:06:41.068 --> 01:06:43.613
about what happened to our parents.

01:06:44.696 --> 01:06:47.116
It's too painful to think about it.

01:06:47.501 --> 01:06:48.862
Yeah, well...

01:06:49.631 --> 01:06:52.706
somebody you love get killed,
it's hard to forget that.

01:06:53.342 --> 01:06:56.095
It just goes away for a little while.

01:06:56.121 --> 01:06:58.284
Look, if you going through
something, anything,

01:06:58.348 --> 01:07:00.182
know you can talk to me.

01:07:00.208 --> 01:07:01.917
I'm here for you.

01:07:04.805 --> 01:07:06.523
Soo, Soo, Soo, what are you doing?

01:07:06.564 --> 01:07:07.941
You said whatever I needed.

01:07:07.983 --> 01:07:09.860
Hey, girl, not that.

01:07:09.901 --> 01:07:11.277
No, no, Soo, stop.

01:07:11.319 --> 01:07:12.487
Soo, wait.

01:07:13.410 --> 01:07:14.839
Soo, stop.

01:07:14.865 --> 01:07:16.199
- Please.
- No, Soo, Soo.

01:07:16.240 --> 01:07:17.325
- No.
- Stop, stop.

01:07:17.367 --> 01:07:19.087
Stop, stop, Soo.

01:07:19.113 --> 01:07:21.634
What, you won't even touch me now?

01:07:23.206 --> 01:07:25.124
The...
the reason I don't touch you is

01:07:25.166 --> 01:07:27.415
because I do respect you, Soo.

01:07:31.047 --> 01:07:33.133
You deserve better than this.

01:07:36.352 --> 01:07:37.491
I'm sorry.

01:07:37.517 --> 01:07:39.561
I... I-I can't.

01:07:40.724 --> 01:07:42.118
I'm sorry, I...

01:07:42.860 --> 01:07:44.644
I just wish someone would tell me

01:07:44.686 --> 01:07:47.480
how to make things
right with my sister.

01:07:47.522 --> 01:07:49.282
Soo, listen to me...

01:08:28.399 --> 01:08:30.817
Okay,
you're gripping it way too tight.

01:08:31.227 --> 01:08:33.062
So take a breather...

01:08:34.986 --> 01:08:37.988
...and just relax and let
it come back to you.

01:08:40.761 --> 01:08:41.826
Ugh.

01:08:42.191 --> 01:08:43.202
It's too far.

01:08:43.243 --> 01:08:46.162
I can't... I can't keep it steady.

01:08:46.205 --> 01:08:48.165
All right, lean on your elbows.

01:08:48.207 --> 01:08:49.917
Take aim, focus.

01:08:49.944 --> 01:08:51.696
Shoot the target in the heart,

01:08:51.721 --> 01:08:54.224
and he still has three
seconds to react.

01:08:54.464 --> 01:08:55.756
Shoot him in the head,

01:08:55.799 --> 01:08:57.475
and you'll penetrate
the nerve center,

01:08:57.502 --> 01:08:59.276
neutralizing him on contact.

01:08:59.301 --> 01:09:01.345
The kill point is
right behind the eyes.

01:09:01.386 --> 01:09:02.761
Remember that.

01:09:03.207 --> 01:09:05.934
There's more to consider
than controlling the weapon.

01:09:05.975 --> 01:09:07.644
If you breathe or your heart beats,

01:09:07.685 --> 01:09:10.729
then your body is subject
to the slightest of motion,

01:09:10.772 --> 01:09:12.732
causing you to miss.

01:09:13.719 --> 01:09:15.082
Try again.

01:09:18.662 --> 01:09:22.073
Inhale and exhale slowly.

01:09:22.783 --> 01:09:26.082
You must match your breathing
to your heartbeat.

01:09:26.629 --> 01:09:29.863
And when you have complete
control of them both,

01:09:30.125 --> 01:09:32.127
at your most stable moment,

01:09:32.785 --> 01:09:33.957
shoot.

01:09:43.144 --> 01:09:44.071
Okay.

01:09:44.096 --> 01:09:45.238
Okay, let's try it again.

01:09:45.264 --> 01:09:46.282
- Let's go.
- All right.

01:09:58.089 --> 01:10:00.284
I'm-a let y'all go ahead and talk.

01:10:04.626 --> 01:10:06.127
Papa's back.

01:10:12.558 --> 01:10:14.853
So what happened?

01:10:16.936 --> 01:10:18.980
Don't worry about that.

01:10:21.230 --> 01:10:25.109
Whether he told me, you told
me, gave me the information,

01:10:25.791 --> 01:10:28.836
you know the outcome's
still the same, right?

01:10:29.850 --> 01:10:34.428
I don't expect you to feel
about it the way that I do.

01:10:34.877 --> 01:10:37.810
- That's good.
- No, that's great.

01:10:39.073 --> 01:10:41.248
That's my cross to bear.

01:10:43.960 --> 01:10:45.943
But I am telling you...

01:10:46.912 --> 01:10:48.888
to stay away from him.

01:10:52.498 --> 01:10:56.717
'Cause I have never seen
that man do anything

01:10:57.338 --> 01:11:00.442
that didn't serve him.

01:11:05.919 --> 01:11:08.191
Well, you know me.

01:11:08.975 --> 01:11:10.977
I don't sweat the petty stuff.

01:11:11.003 --> 01:11:13.463
I pet the sweaty stuff.

01:11:16.306 --> 01:11:17.607
I'm-a go get some air.

01:11:17.648 --> 01:11:18.923
I'll be back.

01:13:19.100 --> 01:13:22.103
You fucked up this time,
you fucking Haitian.

01:13:25.484 --> 01:13:27.920
- Rhyis!
- You good?

01:13:28.363 --> 01:13:29.822
Yeah, I'm cool.

01:13:31.520 --> 01:13:34.051
Hey, you bleeding all over my floors,
man?!

01:13:34.077 --> 01:13:36.670
Or is that pasta sauce
leaking out your ass?

01:13:36.696 --> 01:13:38.092
Fuck you!

01:13:38.118 --> 01:13:39.495
Who you work for, huh?

01:13:39.546 --> 01:13:40.967
Feris?

01:13:41.101 --> 01:13:42.428
The Koreans?

01:13:42.454 --> 01:13:43.831
No.

01:13:43.857 --> 01:13:46.204
Angelo Costa, the man you killed.

01:13:46.230 --> 01:13:47.522
What'd you say?

01:13:47.548 --> 01:13:49.466
He brought you into
this organization,

01:13:49.508 --> 01:13:51.468
made you who you are.

01:13:51.510 --> 01:13:53.600
And this is how you repay him?

01:13:53.626 --> 01:13:55.319
Yeah, but that doesn't matter now,

01:13:55.345 --> 01:13:57.558
'cause you and your
whole fucking crew,

01:13:57.600 --> 01:13:59.819
they're dead!

01:13:59.845 --> 01:14:01.584
They're fucking dead!

01:14:02.646 --> 01:14:04.232
Hey, enough, man!

01:14:04.274 --> 01:14:06.327
I don't fucking believe him!

01:14:06.353 --> 01:14:07.772
Fucking bullshit!

01:14:07.798 --> 01:14:09.087
I don't believe him!

01:14:09.113 --> 01:14:10.865
Well, they obviously did.

01:14:11.114 --> 01:14:14.623
I mean, who else could get close
enough to Angelo to kill him,

01:14:14.649 --> 01:14:17.100
make his own men believe it was you?

01:14:18.969 --> 01:14:20.720
Nick.

01:14:20.746 --> 01:14:23.874
That coked-out, basehead,
mayonnaise motherfucker.

01:14:25.686 --> 01:14:27.327
We got to move.

01:14:27.935 --> 01:14:32.084
'Cause one thing's guaranteed:
there'll be more of them.

01:14:41.560 --> 01:14:43.790
Yo, what about Zho and Grimm?

01:14:43.816 --> 01:14:45.941
They'll be all right by themselves.

01:14:46.397 --> 01:14:48.900
We get to the safe house,
and then we regroup.

01:14:48.926 --> 01:14:50.585
Yo, I got to make a stop, man.

01:14:50.611 --> 01:14:52.447
You go ahead; I'm-a catch up to you.

01:14:52.488 --> 01:14:54.340
What are you talking about?
We got now, together.

01:14:54.365 --> 01:14:55.908
It's okay, man; it's cool, all right?

01:14:55.950 --> 01:14:57.543
I just got to check on something.

01:14:57.569 --> 01:14:59.071
All right, I'll be there.

01:15:18.189 --> 01:15:20.463
So how long have you known Simone?

01:15:21.309 --> 01:15:23.822
We met eight years ago in Germany.

01:15:24.345 --> 01:15:26.108
I was guarding a
high-level politician,

01:15:26.134 --> 01:15:29.359
and she managed to get close
enough to take his life.

01:15:29.400 --> 01:15:33.072
So I had respect for
her; I had to meet her.

01:15:33.098 --> 01:15:36.517
I can't believe people
actually do this for a living.

01:15:36.543 --> 01:15:38.044
Throughout history,

01:15:38.070 --> 01:15:41.259
power has always been a
very important commodity,

01:15:41.345 --> 01:15:44.056
and there are some who
would even kill for it.

01:15:44.136 --> 01:15:46.221
What is that like?

01:15:48.633 --> 01:15:51.094
Taking a person's life?

01:15:52.598 --> 01:15:54.642
You'll know soon enough.

01:15:57.009 --> 01:15:59.469
What are they talking
about down there?

01:15:59.597 --> 01:16:01.432
The less you know, the better.

01:16:02.193 --> 01:16:05.185
They don't like anyone
knowing their next move.

01:16:05.224 --> 01:16:06.645
Including me.

01:16:06.687 --> 01:16:08.467
But who is the guy?

01:16:08.493 --> 01:16:10.397
I mean, come on, he's got
to be somebody important

01:16:10.422 --> 01:16:12.287
for them to keep him so secretive.

01:16:12.313 --> 01:16:14.070
Knight is Simone's partner.

01:16:14.111 --> 01:16:15.321
He stays hidden.

01:16:15.363 --> 01:16:17.261
There's none more ruthless

01:16:17.287 --> 01:16:19.326
and more powerful than him.

01:16:19.381 --> 01:16:22.217
In our profession, he's a legend.

01:16:24.483 --> 01:16:26.412
Wow.

01:16:26.903 --> 01:16:28.748
I can't believe it.

01:16:28.891 --> 01:16:32.162
All countries have
instruments of war.

01:16:33.201 --> 01:16:36.426
Knight and Simone just
happen to be the best.

01:16:38.485 --> 01:16:41.419
I just have one more question.

01:16:42.432 --> 01:16:44.725
The other day at the office,

01:16:45.178 --> 01:16:47.347
if I had said no to all of this,

01:16:47.373 --> 01:16:48.938
would you have killed me?

01:16:48.979 --> 01:16:50.440
Yes.

01:16:52.014 --> 01:16:53.317
But...

01:16:53.359 --> 01:16:55.486
I'm glad I didn't have to.

01:17:00.491 --> 01:17:02.740
Let's be glad.

01:17:04.064 --> 01:17:05.740
Whew.

01:18:03.418 --> 01:18:06.003
Man, this shit used to be so simple.

01:18:07.660 --> 01:18:09.700
Used to be able to take all the risks

01:18:09.726 --> 01:18:11.937
with everything to gain,
nothing to lose.

01:18:12.456 --> 01:18:13.988
Now?

01:18:14.690 --> 01:18:16.900
Everything is fucked up.

01:18:17.225 --> 01:18:18.811
Everything.

01:18:18.837 --> 01:18:21.371
I assumed the responsibility...

01:18:24.621 --> 01:18:26.645
...when I took the throne.

01:18:26.671 --> 01:18:28.887
The old man didn't deserve this.

01:18:30.457 --> 01:18:33.340
He was just as dirty
as the rest of us.

01:18:33.534 --> 01:18:35.246
He's a good man.

01:18:39.023 --> 01:18:40.965
I'm gonna set that straight.

01:18:41.300 --> 01:18:42.635
I guarantee it.

01:18:42.677 --> 01:18:44.551
Yeah, you-you are.

01:18:45.715 --> 01:18:47.973
Hey, look,
you know I got you all day.

01:18:49.371 --> 01:18:51.392
Why don't you tell me something?

01:18:51.418 --> 01:18:53.918
Why you do it, huh?

01:18:53.944 --> 01:18:56.738
We was good the way shit was.

01:18:56.982 --> 01:18:59.026
Why you say yes to that shit?

01:18:59.068 --> 01:19:00.611
I felt I owed it to him.

01:19:00.653 --> 01:19:03.056
Well, you know it's good to
care about nobody or anyone.

01:19:03.082 --> 01:19:05.340
- Yeah?
- Yeah, man, you...

01:19:05.366 --> 01:19:07.201
you of all people should know that.

01:19:07.243 --> 01:19:09.620
You already know that.

01:19:09.662 --> 01:19:11.955
Shit's easier that way.

01:19:12.329 --> 01:19:14.016
Shit's hard enough that
we got to keep track

01:19:14.041 --> 01:19:16.071
of motherfucker in our own crew.

01:19:16.400 --> 01:19:19.249
Yeah, man, you didn't think
people knew about that shit?

01:19:19.275 --> 01:19:20.715
Huh?

01:19:21.579 --> 01:19:23.139
Look,
I know he's your brother and all,

01:19:23.175 --> 01:19:24.837
but you got to admit...

01:19:25.177 --> 01:19:27.263
he's been acting strange lately.

01:19:27.304 --> 01:19:28.556
I mean, where he at right now?

01:19:28.598 --> 01:19:30.087
Where the fuck is he at right now?

01:19:30.113 --> 01:19:31.865
It's a personal matter.

01:19:32.407 --> 01:19:34.814
My brother, just like everyone else,

01:19:34.840 --> 01:19:36.746
has his own shit to deal with.

01:19:36.772 --> 01:19:39.275
But I trust him with my life.

01:19:39.316 --> 01:19:41.694
Always have, always will.

01:19:41.736 --> 01:19:43.320
I know you do. I do, too.

01:19:43.362 --> 01:19:45.172
- Yeah, what?
- But I'm saying if it was anybody else

01:19:45.197 --> 01:19:48.657
outside the crew, they'd
be dead right now, Rhyis!

01:19:50.056 --> 01:19:51.828
They would be.

01:19:52.079 --> 01:19:53.860
Look, I'm just...

01:19:54.564 --> 01:19:56.500
just so know, man, I'm just saying

01:19:56.542 --> 01:19:57.935
when I ain't got no
weight on my hands,

01:19:57.960 --> 01:19:59.970
I do the most fucking damage.

01:20:00.001 --> 01:20:01.382
I'm just saying I...

01:20:01.408 --> 01:20:03.033
I'll take that burden for you, man.

01:20:03.058 --> 01:20:04.954
I do that as a sign of respect.

01:20:04.980 --> 01:20:07.517
Grimm, I appreciate your respect.

01:20:09.001 --> 01:20:10.181
I do.

01:20:11.360 --> 01:20:14.306
Your sincerity, integrity.

01:20:14.851 --> 01:20:17.020
But if any Strap Set member

01:20:17.062 --> 01:20:19.732
would ever lay a hand on my brother,

01:20:21.109 --> 01:20:23.423
I'll put you in a body bag.

01:20:29.079 --> 01:20:30.384
Yeah, man.

01:20:31.532 --> 01:20:33.704
That's understandable.

01:20:34.087 --> 01:20:36.039
Got you.

01:20:36.081 --> 01:20:38.334
I'm sure somebody else
in the same position

01:20:38.375 --> 01:20:40.836
would do the same thing.

01:20:40.877 --> 01:20:42.755
It's family and all.

01:20:42.797 --> 01:20:45.466
Look... Soo Yun...

01:20:45.836 --> 01:20:48.797
she was with me when
Nick's boys attacked me.

01:20:51.659 --> 01:20:55.058
So she died 'cause I
couldn't even protect her.

01:20:56.245 --> 01:20:58.103
You're responsible
for the lives you save

01:20:58.145 --> 01:21:00.581
and for the ones you lose.

01:21:01.273 --> 01:21:03.025
I know, that's the way...

01:21:03.066 --> 01:21:04.652
that's the way she gonna look at it.

01:21:04.694 --> 01:21:06.862
Now I got to deal with
Li about this shit.

01:21:06.903 --> 01:21:10.032
Hey, man, but I'm like,
"Fuck it, man."

01:21:12.393 --> 01:21:13.815
Let it be.

01:21:13.939 --> 01:21:15.573
And for you...

01:21:17.682 --> 01:21:19.253
you, too.

01:21:20.213 --> 01:21:21.924
I'll let that shit be.

01:21:51.699 --> 01:21:53.492
You're certain it was Costa's men?

01:21:53.534 --> 01:21:55.452
Positive.

01:21:55.651 --> 01:21:57.987
One of them said Angelo's name.

01:21:58.013 --> 01:22:00.248
Said he was hit by us.

01:22:00.451 --> 01:22:02.412
But that's bullshit.

01:22:02.438 --> 01:22:04.352
Now I know that there's
some kind of protocol

01:22:04.378 --> 01:22:05.671
for this type of thing.

01:22:05.713 --> 01:22:08.662
But we got to get them
before they get us.

01:22:08.696 --> 01:22:09.896
Right?

01:22:22.328 --> 01:22:24.581
There is an old saying

01:22:25.271 --> 01:22:27.693
that when a snake is provoked,

01:22:28.211 --> 01:22:30.802
it will strike with its venom.

01:22:32.482 --> 01:22:34.450
How certain can you be

01:22:34.491 --> 01:22:36.787
that he is not involved?

01:22:36.896 --> 01:22:38.803
This show of strength

01:22:38.829 --> 01:22:41.457
may easily be a byproduct

01:22:41.498 --> 01:22:43.626
of his own arrogance

01:22:43.667 --> 01:22:45.335
and foolish pride.

01:22:46.216 --> 01:22:50.318
Look, man, I know that you and Rhyis

01:22:50.365 --> 01:22:51.732
have differences.

01:22:53.271 --> 01:22:55.554
And, yeah, he can be a
bit abrasive at times,

01:22:55.596 --> 01:22:58.515
but he wouldn't kill the old man,
no way.

01:22:58.959 --> 01:23:01.154
No, this wasn't in retaliation.

01:23:01.185 --> 01:23:03.599
This was an all-out act of war.

01:23:04.794 --> 01:23:07.286
And I need you to stand with us.

01:23:10.844 --> 01:23:13.248
It's all been arranged.

01:23:13.951 --> 01:23:15.825
But know this.

01:23:16.966 --> 01:23:19.369
There will come a time when <i> you</i>

01:23:19.654 --> 01:23:22.466
will have to make
some tough decisions.

01:23:23.165 --> 01:23:24.708
And I need to know

01:23:24.750 --> 01:23:26.685
that I can depend on you

01:23:27.310 --> 01:23:29.662
to do what is necessary.

01:23:30.496 --> 01:23:32.240
Of course.

01:23:33.451 --> 01:23:35.545
I'm with you, Pop, all the way.

01:23:35.584 --> 01:23:37.387
No question.

01:23:38.334 --> 01:23:39.545
Ah, good.

01:23:40.568 --> 01:23:42.084
<i>Merci petite.</i>

01:23:43.669 --> 01:23:45.277
So...

01:23:46.395 --> 01:23:47.965
where...

01:23:49.279 --> 01:23:51.246
is the safe house?

01:24:07.895 --> 01:24:09.606
What up?

01:24:10.387 --> 01:24:12.520
Glad to see that you made it through.

01:24:12.546 --> 01:24:14.190
I have a serious situation.

01:24:14.216 --> 01:24:16.707
Yeah, I went by the club,
saw the bodies.

01:24:16.762 --> 01:24:19.596
Figured y'all be here.

01:24:19.638 --> 01:24:21.629
Where's Khalil? Is he good?

01:24:22.536 --> 01:24:24.098
Ask him.

01:24:26.047 --> 01:24:27.992
He's on his way.

01:24:32.347 --> 01:24:34.349
I've just gotten word

01:24:34.375 --> 01:24:36.238
that things are moving a bit faster

01:24:36.279 --> 01:24:38.570
than previously... anticipated.

01:24:39.984 --> 01:24:41.875
The job has been moved up.

01:24:42.406 --> 01:24:44.038
She'll be ready.

01:24:44.398 --> 01:24:46.916
A bit rough around the edges,

01:24:47.355 --> 01:24:48.940
but ready nonetheless.

01:24:49.570 --> 01:24:51.211
I hope she was the...

01:24:51.253 --> 01:24:52.883
best choice.

01:24:53.085 --> 01:24:55.602
In any case, the most logical.

01:24:56.299 --> 01:24:57.927
No father.

01:24:58.508 --> 01:24:59.929
A college degree,

01:24:59.970 --> 01:25:02.242
but drowning in debt.

01:25:03.328 --> 01:25:05.392
A severe case of depression

01:25:05.434 --> 01:25:07.019
and a desperate need to be accepted

01:25:07.061 --> 01:25:09.273
by anyone who will listen.

01:25:10.185 --> 01:25:11.609
Especially men.

01:25:13.709 --> 01:25:16.086
I've left her with Vincent.

01:25:16.156 --> 01:25:18.321
She seems to have
taken a liking to him.

01:25:19.422 --> 01:25:22.325
Did you have any
difficulty tracking her?

01:25:22.985 --> 01:25:24.134
No.

01:25:24.160 --> 01:25:27.664
Once we found her workplace,
it was easy enough.

01:25:28.422 --> 01:25:30.758
I had her vehicle incapacitated.

01:25:31.001 --> 01:25:33.445
It was crude, yet effective.

01:25:34.203 --> 01:25:37.009
We gave her a ride,
handed her a weapon.

01:25:37.035 --> 01:25:39.704
It's very seductive- the gun.

01:25:40.329 --> 01:25:42.832
Shows us who we really are.

01:25:44.387 --> 01:25:47.320
After that,
it didn't take much convincing.

01:25:48.008 --> 01:25:50.734
I know that when the time is right,

01:25:50.821 --> 01:25:52.448
she'll pull the trigger.

01:25:56.691 --> 01:25:58.210
Outstanding.

01:25:59.750 --> 01:26:01.406
Nick and his boys will be waiting

01:26:01.448 --> 01:26:02.825
for us to come to him.

01:26:02.866 --> 01:26:04.785
Yeah, well, we have to expect

01:26:04.827 --> 01:26:06.870
that they'll outnumber
us at least four to one.

01:26:06.912 --> 01:26:08.288
Okay, so what's the next move?

01:26:08.330 --> 01:26:10.656
They'll be waiting.

01:26:10.682 --> 01:26:13.328
So we need someone to
lead them back here.

01:26:13.860 --> 01:26:15.529
Take advantage on home court.

01:26:15.555 --> 01:26:16.797
That's me. I'll do it.

01:26:16.839 --> 01:26:19.215
I can move a lot
faster on two wheels.

01:26:19.257 --> 01:26:21.677
Plus...
I got some shit I got to handle.

01:26:21.718 --> 01:26:23.178
Rhyis?

01:26:23.648 --> 01:26:26.515
Now, you know we can't touch him,
man.

01:26:27.086 --> 01:26:28.783
If we take out Angelo's son,

01:26:28.809 --> 01:26:31.687
no one else in this city will
ever do business with us again.

01:26:32.477 --> 01:26:34.852
That rule no longer applies.

01:26:36.289 --> 01:26:37.818
We set our feet,

01:26:38.250 --> 01:26:40.039
lock and load.

01:26:40.218 --> 01:26:43.992
If anyone gets a
shot at Angelo's son,

01:26:44.356 --> 01:26:45.691
you take it.

01:26:45.867 --> 01:26:48.912
Nobody leaves here except Strap Set.

01:26:49.063 --> 01:26:50.638
Understood?

01:26:50.664 --> 01:26:52.124
Hell yeah.

01:26:54.501 --> 01:26:55.961
You ever have some pussy so good

01:26:56.003 --> 01:26:58.588
it make you want to
go to war like this?

01:27:30.323 --> 01:27:33.910
Meet me at the top of the district.

01:27:56.664 --> 01:27:57.998
Li...

01:28:02.028 --> 01:28:03.839
Look, I know you're upset,

01:28:03.865 --> 01:28:06.450
but I need you to
understand something, Li.

01:28:06.476 --> 01:28:09.957
I did do everything in
my power to protect her.

01:28:11.286 --> 01:28:13.038
These motherfuckers,

01:28:13.080 --> 01:28:15.165
they just came out of nowhere,
a'ight?

01:28:15.207 --> 01:28:17.209
I don't even know how they found me,
but...

01:28:17.251 --> 01:28:20.254
I don't know how, but... they knew.

01:28:20.295 --> 01:28:21.511
What?!

01:28:30.592 --> 01:28:32.260
Ugh.

01:28:45.528 --> 01:28:47.114
I trusted you

01:28:47.156 --> 01:28:49.433
with the one person
left in this world

01:28:49.459 --> 01:28:50.794
that mattered to me

01:28:51.753 --> 01:28:53.738
...and you let her die.

01:28:54.668 --> 01:28:56.832
Those men came for you.

01:28:56.858 --> 01:28:59.839
You're the one should be dead,
not her.

01:29:01.753 --> 01:29:04.035
I thought you were different...

01:29:04.061 --> 01:29:06.457
different from other men.

01:29:06.649 --> 01:29:09.610
I trusted you with all my heart.

01:29:11.122 --> 01:29:12.931
But it's a pity...

01:29:13.767 --> 01:29:16.540
in the end, you're all the same.

01:29:17.269 --> 01:29:19.229
You only care about money

01:29:19.673 --> 01:29:20.772
and power.

01:29:21.079 --> 01:29:22.497
Are you serious?

01:29:23.423 --> 01:29:26.236
I mean, have you seen
where the fuck I live at?

01:29:26.278 --> 01:29:28.197
Look at my face!

01:29:28.534 --> 01:29:32.063
I don't give a fuck about
no goddamn money or power!

01:29:32.612 --> 01:29:34.948
All I care about is my family.

01:29:34.974 --> 01:29:38.064
Soo... and you are my family.

01:29:40.832 --> 01:29:42.720
I loved your sister.

01:29:43.771 --> 01:29:46.732
I pushed her away so
I could keep her safe.

01:29:47.040 --> 01:29:49.051
You brought her right back to me, Li.

01:29:49.092 --> 01:29:50.677
You did.

01:29:50.719 --> 01:29:53.722
So you're just as responsible
for her death as I am.

01:29:53.763 --> 01:29:56.599
Yeah. And you want to kill me?

01:29:57.680 --> 01:29:58.999
Fine, then.

01:29:59.668 --> 01:30:01.411
Do what you gotta do.

01:30:01.983 --> 01:30:03.491
I will.

01:30:09.515 --> 01:30:11.334
Ah!

01:31:04.886 --> 01:31:06.304
Hello?

01:31:06.902 --> 01:31:08.582
Yeah, hold on.

01:31:09.532 --> 01:31:11.902
Nick, it's Tony.

01:31:15.156 --> 01:31:17.075
Talk to me.

01:31:18.838 --> 01:31:20.449
Got it.

01:31:22.387 --> 01:31:24.121
It's showtime.

01:31:44.033 --> 01:31:46.785
Okay, gentlemen,
our guests have arrived.

01:31:46.960 --> 01:31:48.920
Let's work.

01:32:04.692 --> 01:32:06.527
Grab the case from the trunk.

01:32:06.732 --> 01:32:08.316
Head across the street.

01:32:08.342 --> 01:32:10.218
Take the elevator to the roof.

01:32:10.244 --> 01:32:11.746
Assemble the weapon

01:32:11.772 --> 01:32:14.233
and wait for further instructions.

01:32:55.904 --> 01:32:57.280
Shit, Grimm, you good?

01:32:57.322 --> 01:32:58.698
Yeah. Give me...

01:32:58.740 --> 01:33:01.159
Get inside. Right behind you.

01:34:43.264 --> 01:34:44.304
You good?

01:34:44.351 --> 01:34:45.721
Fuck, man.

01:34:45.763 --> 01:34:47.349
This is a fucking

01:34:47.390 --> 01:34:49.562
- $900 blazer, man.
- Man, come on, don't worry

01:34:49.588 --> 01:34:51.781
about that shit. We'll get
you another one, all right?

01:34:51.811 --> 01:34:53.313
I'm saying this is iguana, man.

01:34:53.355 --> 01:34:55.398
Can't just buy this
shit off the rack.

01:35:21.161 --> 01:35:24.013
Ain't no exits this way,
motherfucker.

01:35:28.976 --> 01:35:31.380
And you know I never liked you.

01:35:31.705 --> 01:35:34.989
You walk around here,
thinking you run shit.

01:35:35.204 --> 01:35:37.841
So motherfucking smooth.

01:35:38.605 --> 01:35:40.582
And look at you now. Huh?

01:35:43.803 --> 01:35:47.138
You know, I don't really
care much for guns.

01:35:48.119 --> 01:35:49.871
I'm, uh...

01:35:51.454 --> 01:35:53.841
...more of a purist.

01:35:54.207 --> 01:35:56.834
And I've waited a long time

01:35:56.876 --> 01:35:59.087
to kill you myself.

01:36:16.688 --> 01:36:17.939
Ah!

01:36:44.267 --> 01:36:46.873
Come on, you motherfucker!

01:36:47.574 --> 01:36:49.138
Come on!

01:36:52.095 --> 01:36:53.881
Let's go!

01:36:55.365 --> 01:36:56.770
Come on!

01:36:56.810 --> 01:37:00.162
Get out here,
you black motherfuckers!

01:37:01.499 --> 01:37:02.662
You want this?

01:37:02.688 --> 01:37:04.606
Let's go! Bring it!

01:37:04.632 --> 01:37:07.093
You can't fucking touch me!

01:37:09.358 --> 01:37:11.433
None of you motherfuckers
can touch me!

01:37:11.459 --> 01:37:14.663
You think you're fucking tough?

01:37:14.704 --> 01:37:16.706
Get the fuck out here!

01:37:16.748 --> 01:37:18.166
You want this?!

01:37:18.207 --> 01:37:20.006
- I'm right here!
- Wait...

01:37:20.032 --> 01:37:21.491
...for my signal.

01:37:21.877 --> 01:37:23.637
None of you motherfuckers
can touch me!

01:37:23.672 --> 01:37:26.758
Come on! I'm right here!

01:37:26.800 --> 01:37:28.760
I'm right here!

01:37:28.802 --> 01:37:32.013
I'm right fucking here!

01:37:32.054 --> 01:37:34.162
Missed me, bitches!

01:37:34.194 --> 01:37:36.480
You missed me, motherfuckers!

01:37:36.889 --> 01:37:38.662
Get ready to fire

01:37:38.688 --> 01:37:40.365
on my mark.

01:37:41.585 --> 01:37:44.631
What type of coked-out rat bastard

01:37:44.657 --> 01:37:46.623
- piece of shit
- Wait for my signal.

01:37:46.649 --> 01:37:48.191
Kills his own father?

01:37:48.279 --> 01:37:49.656
Fire.

01:37:51.283 --> 01:37:53.410
Pull the trigger right now.

01:37:53.998 --> 01:37:56.830
I didn't have much
choice in the matter.

01:37:57.420 --> 01:37:59.457
Couldn't very well let you
take over, now, could I?

01:37:59.499 --> 01:38:01.917
Well, it won't matter after today,
will it?

01:38:01.943 --> 01:38:03.780
You have no fucking clue

01:38:03.806 --> 01:38:07.101
what's going on, do you?

01:38:07.569 --> 01:38:09.787
Do it now, or they all die.

01:38:10.819 --> 01:38:11.845
Do it!

01:38:17.969 --> 01:38:19.555
How disappointing.

01:38:20.537 --> 01:38:23.064
Make sure she doesn't leave the roof,

01:38:23.222 --> 01:38:25.851
unless you're throwing her off of it.

01:38:40.665 --> 01:38:42.155
This is personal.

01:38:42.647 --> 01:38:44.881
Between me and them.

01:38:45.762 --> 01:38:47.998
It's got nothing to do...

01:38:49.736 --> 01:38:51.363
Got you, I got you.

01:38:53.042 --> 01:38:55.362
- Relax, relax!
- I'm good! I'm good.

01:38:55.388 --> 01:38:57.390
- No.
- I'm good.

01:38:57.432 --> 01:38:58.641
He's cool, man, he's cool.

01:38:58.683 --> 01:38:59.933
Look, I'm gonna find out where

01:38:59.975 --> 01:39:01.160
- that shot came from, huh?
- Go.

01:39:01.185 --> 01:39:02.395
Rhyis...

01:39:02.858 --> 01:39:04.105
Go.

01:39:04.731 --> 01:39:05.731
Go!

01:39:34.594 --> 01:39:35.969
Stand up.

01:39:48.957 --> 01:39:50.209
I'm ready.

01:40:15.811 --> 01:40:17.361
Take the rear exit to the building,

01:40:17.386 --> 01:40:19.514
leave town today and never come back.

01:40:22.684 --> 01:40:25.475
When I fired the weapon,
you didn't flinch.

01:40:25.825 --> 01:40:27.912
You're strong enough to
make it on your own now.

01:40:30.333 --> 01:40:31.842
Thank you.

01:43:03.576 --> 01:43:06.321
Pop, what are you doing, man?

01:43:06.347 --> 01:43:09.433
Your people attacked
us instead of them.

01:43:11.365 --> 01:43:13.853
They were instructed not to harm you.

01:43:13.879 --> 01:43:15.172
Please understand,

01:43:15.476 --> 01:43:17.936
your brother left me no choice.

01:43:18.252 --> 01:43:20.170
I tried to reason with him,

01:43:20.376 --> 01:43:23.128
gave him every
opportunity to join us.

01:43:23.384 --> 01:43:25.368
But he would not listen.

01:43:26.290 --> 01:43:27.827
Wh... Pop, wait.

01:43:27.869 --> 01:43:29.244
Wait.

01:43:52.185 --> 01:43:54.269
Papa, wait.

01:43:57.737 --> 01:44:00.400
He threatens everything
we've worked for.

01:44:01.134 --> 01:44:03.337
There can be no other outcome.

01:44:04.188 --> 01:44:08.962
When Rhyis is gone, you
will take his place.

01:44:10.512 --> 01:44:11.847
No.

01:44:12.030 --> 01:44:15.158
No,
I will not let you hurt my brother.

01:44:23.109 --> 01:44:25.028
I'm sorry, my son.

01:44:25.482 --> 01:44:28.946
One day, you will see things my way.

01:44:37.086 --> 01:44:39.255
Hey!

01:44:45.942 --> 01:44:49.528
I thought I told you to stay
the fuck away from my brother.

01:44:49.812 --> 01:44:52.897
Death shouldn't be rushed.

01:44:53.631 --> 01:44:58.202
A real killer...
savors it like fine wine

01:44:59.017 --> 01:45:01.200
and enjoys the aroma.

01:45:04.155 --> 01:45:08.670
I suppose you're wondering
how I knew where you were.

01:45:09.666 --> 01:45:12.043
Khalil came to see me last night.

01:45:12.592 --> 01:45:15.881
He was concerned for you
all, asked for my help.

01:45:16.803 --> 01:45:18.741
Don't blame him.

01:45:19.177 --> 01:45:21.217
Young people are impulsive,

01:45:21.799 --> 01:45:25.381
often making rash decisions
that can prove costly.

01:45:27.165 --> 01:45:29.413
I'm guilty of it myself.

01:45:30.316 --> 01:45:33.967
You see, I should have killed you

01:45:34.515 --> 01:45:36.601
when you threatened me before.

01:45:38.630 --> 01:45:41.030
If the hammer is light...

01:45:42.223 --> 01:45:45.615
the nail will rise back up.

01:47:47.683 --> 01:47:50.022
No...!

01:47:56.034 --> 01:47:58.119
No!

01:48:09.460 --> 01:48:12.402
All... that I was...

01:48:14.828 --> 01:48:18.496
you have... have become.

01:48:20.808 --> 01:48:22.621
All...

01:48:23.456 --> 01:48:26.112
that I have...

01:48:27.051 --> 01:48:30.980
you... now own.

01:48:32.496 --> 01:48:35.043
My power...

01:48:35.717 --> 01:48:37.551
is... is yours...

01:48:39.390 --> 01:48:41.176
to do...

01:48:43.111 --> 01:48:45.948
as you see fit.

01:48:48.437 --> 01:48:52.457
Each of us lives an eternity,

01:48:53.333 --> 01:48:56.253
dying only after our forever,

01:48:57.321 --> 01:49:00.316
only unconscious of our ties.

01:49:02.409 --> 01:49:04.309
No longer separate...

01:49:06.058 --> 01:49:08.090
...or together.

01:49:37.405 --> 01:49:39.490
I couldn't let him do it.

01:49:42.375 --> 01:49:44.251
It's dislocated.

01:50:10.887 --> 01:50:14.447
<i>My father taught me
a valuable lesson...</i>

01:50:14.897 --> 01:50:20.041
<i>that no one can love or hate
with more passion than family.</i>

01:50:21.034 --> 01:50:23.412
<i>A war had been fought
between he and I,</i>

01:50:23.780 --> 01:50:27.267
<i>but from his ashes a new
inheritant had been formed.</i>

01:50:29.568 --> 01:50:32.635
<i>He bestowed upon me</i>
all <i> of his authority.</i>

01:50:33.729 --> 01:50:35.712
Long live the king.

01:50:36.052 --> 01:50:37.580
<i>And with it...</i>

01:50:37.816 --> 01:50:39.267
I'll be in touch.

01:50:39.293 --> 01:50:43.122
<i>...control over the weapons
trade in 18 territories.</i>

01:50:56.931 --> 01:51:00.569
That is an interesting story,
my friend.

01:51:02.924 --> 01:51:05.209
But I fail to know your point.

01:51:06.077 --> 01:51:08.913
The point is- we supply over 75%

01:51:08.954 --> 01:51:11.140
of your employer's munitions.

01:51:11.233 --> 01:51:13.598
So you can choose to continue

01:51:13.624 --> 01:51:15.365
to do business with this organization

01:51:15.391 --> 01:51:19.187
or find yourself and the men you
work for in an extremely...

01:51:21.038 --> 01:51:23.140
vulnerable position.

01:51:24.219 --> 01:51:25.624
Starting now.

01:51:27.695 --> 01:51:29.335
Of course, that choice is yours.

01:51:31.065 --> 01:51:34.384
What about Knight and Simone?

01:51:40.660 --> 01:51:43.827
...is no longer the face
of the organization.

01:51:45.663 --> 01:51:47.099
I am.

01:51:54.671 --> 01:51:56.423
Outstanding.

01:51:57.074 --> 01:52:00.370
I'll be more than happy to
show you our new inventory.

01:52:01.809 --> 01:52:04.106
Right this way, General.

01:52:04.945 --> 01:52:08.824
Now, I'm prepared to make you
a most generous proposal,

01:52:09.598 --> 01:52:12.393
a proposal that will stand
for the next 20 minutes,

01:52:12.434 --> 01:52:15.563
at which point, the offer
will go into remission.
