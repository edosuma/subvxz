00:00.960 --> 00:03.173
[June] Previously on
The Handmaid's Tale...

00:03.256 --> 00:04.885
My name is June Osborn.

00:04.968 --> 00:07.849
Fred Waterford
and Serena Joy imprisoned me...

00:07.974 --> 00:10.062
‐[gasps]
‐...beat me, and raped me.

00:10.145 --> 00:11.314
No! Stop!

00:11.397 --> 00:12.817
[Commander Fred]
The sacrifices we all made

00:12.901 --> 00:14.070
in Gilead were difficult.

00:14.153 --> 00:17.201
But where else on Earth
is the birth rate rising?

00:17.284 --> 00:19.413
I am done. Anything more
can wait for your trial.

00:19.497 --> 00:21.877
[Naomi] If this ordeal isn't
over by the time the baby comes,

00:21.961 --> 00:24.633
it would be our honor
to raise him in our home.

00:24.716 --> 00:27.179
I expect to be free
once proceedings are over with.

00:27.263 --> 00:30.185
Well, that's wonderful.
You can come home.

00:30.269 --> 00:32.481
That baby belongs in Gilead.

00:32.565 --> 00:36.615
Hello, June Osborn.
You must want something.

00:36.699 --> 00:37.909
It's about getting Hannah.

00:37.993 --> 00:39.788
I'll get you Hannah,
if you get me

00:39.871 --> 00:42.167
ten of the kids
you flew out of here.

00:42.251 --> 00:43.629
No.

00:45.215 --> 00:48.764
We have to find her
and bring her to Canada.

00:51.812 --> 00:53.398
[Nick] Never thought
I'd give it to you in person.

00:53.481 --> 00:54.735
Oh, my God.

00:54.818 --> 00:56.989
[Nick] At least you know
where she is now.

00:57.072 --> 00:58.868
I should've run away with you
when I had the chance.

01:00.454 --> 01:04.128
Gilead could come for our son.
They could make me a Handmaid.

01:04.211 --> 01:06.550
I'll do everything in my power
to make sure

01:06.634 --> 01:08.470
you and our son are protected.

01:08.554 --> 01:10.933
What could you possibly do
from in here?

01:11.017 --> 01:12.812
So, what happens next?
How do we get Hannah?

01:12.896 --> 01:15.067
We have a new asset who knows
how the system operates.

01:15.150 --> 01:16.069
He could advise us.

01:16.152 --> 01:17.864
‐[Luke] Who is it?
‐Fred Waterford.

01:18.783 --> 01:19.785
Waterford?

01:19.868 --> 01:22.206
He has agreed to share
his wealth of knowledge.

01:22.289 --> 01:23.416
In exchange for his freedom.

01:23.501 --> 01:24.544
Stop it! Stop! No!

01:24.628 --> 01:25.963
[Mark] Inside information
about Gilead.

01:26.047 --> 01:28.176
The prosecution
has dropped its charges.

01:28.259 --> 01:29.178
[Luke] June!

01:29.261 --> 01:30.807
He's a fucking rapist!

01:30.890 --> 01:35.065
You know what he did
to all of us! I will kill you!

01:37.612 --> 01:41.620
[people talking indistinctly]

01:42.831 --> 01:46.212
[mellow music playing]

01:54.186 --> 01:55.982
[June] It has to look like love.

01:57.025 --> 01:58.988
That's what he needs.

02:03.789 --> 02:05.751
Pretend you like it.

02:08.841 --> 02:10.970
Pretend you love it.

02:12.055 --> 02:13.183
Pretend you want him.

02:17.441 --> 02:18.903
He is your Commander.

02:21.909 --> 02:23.788
Make him your whole world.

02:25.123 --> 02:31.093
Your sun, your moon,
and all your stars.

02:32.555 --> 02:34.391
Make him believe.

02:35.268 --> 02:38.024
Because your motherfucking
life depends on it.

02:44.286 --> 02:47.794
Don't run. Don't kick.

02:51.467 --> 02:53.471
Don't scream.

02:55.560 --> 02:57.479
Don't bite it off.

02:58.106 --> 02:59.358
Don't...

03:01.780 --> 03:03.576
bite.

03:06.582 --> 03:07.625
[door closes]

03:07.709 --> 03:10.130
[footsteps approaching]

03:15.390 --> 03:17.227
Good morning, Ms. Osborn.

03:18.856 --> 03:20.568
[exhales]

03:22.989 --> 03:25.661
I really would prefer it
if you weren't here.

03:25.745 --> 03:29.502
I understand. I'll be as quick
as possible. This way, please.

03:30.796 --> 03:31.923
[scoffs]

03:38.937 --> 03:42.486
Commander Fredrick Waterford
has been offered leniency

03:42.570 --> 03:45.033
in exchange for his cooperation.

03:45.116 --> 03:46.494
Before the plea agreement
is approved,

03:46.578 --> 03:49.333
you have been invited to make
a statement to the court,

03:49.416 --> 03:50.460
giving your comment

03:50.544 --> 03:52.840
on Commander Waterford's
potential release.

03:52.924 --> 03:55.345
It will be shown at his
I. C. C. sentencing hearing

03:55.428 --> 03:57.809
and remain a permanent part
of the tribunal record.

03:57.892 --> 03:59.562
Do you have any questions
I can answer at this point

03:59.646 --> 04:01.942
about the status
of the Commander's case?

04:02.527 --> 04:03.696
Nope.

04:05.323 --> 04:06.576
[door opens]

04:07.954 --> 04:09.289
[door closes]

04:09.708 --> 04:12.337
I apologize that we couldn't
arrange an in‐person hearing.

04:12.797 --> 04:15.051
Judges have busy schedules.

04:15.135 --> 04:17.055
There was certainly
no disrespect intended.

04:17.139 --> 04:18.391
[June scoffs]

04:21.313 --> 04:23.610
Ms. Osborn,
I should caution you.

04:24.738 --> 04:26.700
Sentencing agreements
like this one

04:26.783 --> 04:28.746
are usually approved
by the court.

04:28.829 --> 04:31.000
Commander Waterford will,
in all likelihood,

04:31.083 --> 04:34.298
be granted immunity
in exchange for his cooperation.

04:38.389 --> 04:40.561
So I should just get
comfortable with the fact

04:40.644 --> 04:42.189
that he's gonna get out.

04:43.567 --> 04:45.070
No matter what he did.

04:47.449 --> 04:49.161
No matter what I say.

04:52.417 --> 04:53.545
No.

04:54.129 --> 04:58.639
I don't expect you
to be comfortable with this.

05:02.772 --> 05:06.195
Is he everything you hoped for?

05:08.992 --> 05:10.370
Absolutely.

05:11.581 --> 05:13.376
He's already rewritten
our understanding

05:13.459 --> 05:15.421
of the Gilead command hierarchy.

05:15.506 --> 05:17.134
He is proving to be

05:17.217 --> 05:20.390
an intelligence asset
of great value, yes.

05:22.060 --> 05:23.981
You won't be able
to shut him up.

05:26.068 --> 05:29.491
[door opens and closes]

05:29.576 --> 05:31.580
Weak men, hmm?

05:34.752 --> 05:37.215
They do make the world go round.

05:39.929 --> 05:42.560
I am on your side, Ms. Osborn.

05:45.566 --> 05:49.448
I was a prisoner
that Waterford would sometimes

05:49.532 --> 05:51.953
take out to fuck.

05:52.830 --> 05:54.792
And you're gonna set him free.

05:58.675 --> 06:00.386
You don't have a side.

06:04.019 --> 06:08.027
Thank you for continuing
to participate in the process.

06:17.128 --> 06:21.387
[door opens and closes]

06:26.063 --> 06:28.234
Just two minutes. I'm so sorry.

06:28.317 --> 06:29.737
Take your time.

06:57.083 --> 06:58.210
Blue.

06:59.630 --> 07:01.050
I let it take me.

07:03.638 --> 07:08.230
Blue moon. Blue velvet.

07:08.314 --> 07:10.652
Blue Man Group.

07:11.361 --> 07:14.911
[bed thumping]

07:53.530 --> 07:56.828
No, I... yeah.
I‐I understand that.

08:00.209 --> 08:01.044
[Moira] No, no, no.

08:01.128 --> 08:02.715
Is there anything
that we can do about it?

08:03.842 --> 08:04.719
Hey.

08:05.219 --> 08:06.180
[June] Hi.

08:07.766 --> 08:09.520
‐Well, how was it?
‐[Moira] Nothing!

08:10.188 --> 08:11.481
It was shitty.

08:11.566 --> 08:12.818
‐Nothing?
‐And it's done.

08:13.444 --> 08:14.487
Yeah.

08:16.951 --> 08:19.164
‐Um...
‐No, I‐I get it.

08:19.247 --> 08:20.333
Look.

08:20.626 --> 08:22.253
[Nichole calling out]

08:22.337 --> 08:23.965
‐Your royal highness.
‐[Moira] Yeah, thank you.

08:24.049 --> 08:25.886
‐I'll get her.
‐Thanks.

08:25.969 --> 08:29.100
Look, I... You...
You're here, right?

08:29.184 --> 08:31.981
Nichole is here.
That's a miracle.

08:32.065 --> 08:34.069
‐Yeah. Yeah, it is.
‐Right?

08:34.152 --> 08:36.532
So, we just... we just gotta
count our blessings and...

08:36.616 --> 08:38.452
[Moira] No. No, thank you.

08:38.536 --> 08:40.206
I know, you're right.

08:40.289 --> 08:41.793
[Moira] Well, thank...
thank you.

08:41.876 --> 08:43.420
I ca... I'll be back.

08:43.505 --> 08:44.882
Thanks.

08:44.966 --> 08:46.218
[Moira] But when did they do it?

08:46.301 --> 08:47.220
You're back.

08:49.224 --> 08:50.686
‐Praise be.
‐[Moira] Uh‐huh.

08:51.938 --> 08:52.940
Yeah.

08:53.315 --> 08:55.779
I have tea, or are you hungry?

08:55.862 --> 08:56.656
Rita...

08:56.739 --> 08:57.825
[Moira] The decision, Rachel.

08:57.908 --> 08:59.829
I'm gonna need you
to stop serving me.

09:00.454 --> 09:03.127
And I need you to stop cleaning.

09:03.210 --> 09:07.051
Oh. I am working on it
with my therapist.

09:07.135 --> 09:09.097
So, sit down.

09:09.180 --> 09:10.308
[Moira] Yeah, I understand.

09:10.391 --> 09:11.351
Okay.

09:11.435 --> 09:13.147
[Moira] I‐I understand.

09:14.692 --> 09:16.194
Yeah, thank you.

09:16.988 --> 09:19.326
They're sending Waterford
to fucking Geneva!

09:20.286 --> 09:21.455
They're gonna
fly the prick there

09:21.539 --> 09:22.583
and have his immunity hearing.

09:23.125 --> 09:24.169
[scoffs]

09:25.714 --> 09:28.135
And then he's a free man.
He's free to just set up

09:28.218 --> 09:30.056
wherever the fuck he wants,
with his

09:30.139 --> 09:32.185
Viking‐ass wife.

09:34.732 --> 09:37.236
When? When is he leaving,
do you know?

09:37.320 --> 09:38.447
End of the week.

09:39.742 --> 09:43.332
He will be gone
by the end of the week.

09:43.415 --> 09:44.543
Well, good.

09:44.627 --> 09:46.506
Out of sight, out of mind.

09:50.388 --> 09:52.559
Hey. You need to go to Geneva.

09:52.643 --> 09:53.978
No. I don't agree.

09:54.062 --> 09:56.316
We're gonna raise the money
and then you can go there

09:56.400 --> 09:57.736
and testify in person.

09:57.820 --> 09:58.613
No.

09:58.697 --> 09:59.907
[Moira] Why?

09:59.990 --> 10:02.370
Because it's pointless,
they've made their decision.

10:02.453 --> 10:04.124
[Moira] No, look,
forget about the I. C. C.

10:04.207 --> 10:07.463
You can do interviews.
You can talk to the press.

10:07.548 --> 10:11.054
You do it.
You're good... either of you.

10:11.138 --> 10:12.808
Don't include me in this.

10:19.362 --> 10:22.410
I mean, they won't
do this, right?

10:23.162 --> 10:26.001
Like, he can't just be out.

10:27.671 --> 10:28.923
I mean, shit,
they've gotta listen to you.

10:29.007 --> 10:31.136
You're June fucking Osborn.

10:31.763 --> 10:33.558
Maybe he's more
important than I am.

10:33.641 --> 10:36.062
[Moira] Waterford?
That's fucking crazy.

10:36.146 --> 10:38.108
[June] Well, I told my story.

10:38.943 --> 10:41.281
I got up, and I
told them everything.

10:41.364 --> 10:43.327
They know what he was.

10:43.410 --> 10:45.372
What he did and how it felt.

10:47.168 --> 10:48.797
They made a deal
with him anyway.

10:49.715 --> 10:51.594
So maybe what he's giving them

10:51.677 --> 10:54.098
is more valuable
than what he took from me.

10:54.182 --> 10:55.894
Don't say that.

10:59.484 --> 11:01.279
[phone ringing]

11:04.035 --> 11:06.164
You're going to Geneva.

11:07.208 --> 11:08.628
I'm gonna help them
raise the money

11:08.711 --> 11:11.509
and then you're going to Geneva.

11:25.411 --> 11:26.914
[Commander Fred]
I recognize her.

11:27.415 --> 11:31.089
Ryan? Riley, perhaps? I'm sorry.

11:31.883 --> 11:34.053
[woman] Dr. Martina Burnell.

11:35.014 --> 11:36.934
‐She was an oncologist.
‐Ah.

11:37.018 --> 11:40.609
Her last posting in Gilead
was at a Jezebel's in Boston.

11:41.694 --> 11:43.698
Is that where you
recall seeing her?

11:43.781 --> 11:46.704
Contrary to what you
may have been told,

11:46.787 --> 11:49.125
I did not frequent
that establishment.

11:49.208 --> 11:50.712
[woman] Of course.

11:51.547 --> 11:53.676
Did you have occasion
to interact with her

11:53.760 --> 11:56.264
on any of your
infrequent visits?

11:56.348 --> 11:58.393
Not in the way you're implying.

12:00.732 --> 12:03.403
We spoke. We may have danced.

12:03.487 --> 12:05.575
[woman] Can you confirm
that she is deceased?

12:08.873 --> 12:10.376
Mr. Waterford,

12:10.459 --> 12:12.213
I know this is very difficult,

12:13.883 --> 12:16.722
but you are bringing closure
to many families.

12:21.272 --> 12:24.822
I believe Riley
passed away in an accident.

12:25.740 --> 12:28.997
Dr. Burnell, excuse me.

12:29.080 --> 12:31.334
This was an accident
at Jezebel's?

12:31.961 --> 12:35.384
Yes. Commander Johnston,
I recall.

12:35.467 --> 12:38.975
[woman] Brian L. Johnston.
Did he face charges of any kind?

12:39.058 --> 12:40.144
[Commander Fred] Oh, no.

12:40.227 --> 12:43.526
I don't believe
there was any intent of harm.

12:43.609 --> 12:44.862
Good morning.

12:44.945 --> 12:46.072
You're late.

12:46.615 --> 12:48.911
I wasn't aware we had
a scheduled meeting.

12:50.164 --> 12:52.794
The Commander is giving you
everything that you want.

12:52.878 --> 12:54.506
Military command structure,

12:54.590 --> 12:56.426
resources, the Colonies.
Correct?

12:56.510 --> 12:57.679
‐Yes.
‐I'm sure

12:57.763 --> 13:00.184
he's making you look
quite good to your bosses.

13:01.729 --> 13:03.608
Is there something I can do
for you, Mrs. Waterford?

13:03.691 --> 13:05.277
Yes, you can start
with that woman.

13:05.360 --> 13:07.198
Her contempt
is completely unacceptable.

13:07.281 --> 13:10.872
Mrs. Waterford, your husband
has confessed to brutal crimes,

13:11.665 --> 13:14.546
many of which
you witnessed yourself.

13:17.051 --> 13:19.222
She will refer to him
as "Commander,"

13:19.305 --> 13:21.434
or this interview will end.

13:27.864 --> 13:29.827
The Commander needs
much faster Internet access.

13:31.246 --> 13:32.958
The press requests
are becoming overwhelming,

13:33.041 --> 13:34.545
and he has a constituency

13:34.628 --> 13:36.549
that he has every right
to communicate with.

13:36.632 --> 13:37.551
Already done.

13:37.634 --> 13:39.387
Excellent. Now, house hunting.

13:40.222 --> 13:43.186
We're going to need a home that
is big enough for our family.

13:43.855 --> 13:45.525
Of course,
security is a concern,

13:45.608 --> 13:47.194
so once the Commander
returns from Europe,

13:47.278 --> 13:49.031
I would like to schedule
some tours.

13:49.115 --> 13:51.244
You are both still under custody

13:51.327 --> 13:53.123
until the judges'
ruling is issued.

13:53.206 --> 13:56.004
The judges' ruling
needs to be expedited.

13:58.466 --> 14:02.224
June Osborn required
another say in court

14:02.308 --> 14:04.061
to get it out of her system.

14:04.145 --> 14:06.190
It's fine,
but let it be done now.

14:07.569 --> 14:08.988
The Commander and I
have discussed it.

14:09.071 --> 14:11.869
We will not have our son
born in this place.

14:15.960 --> 14:18.256
I will speak to
the Prosecutor's Office.

14:20.302 --> 14:23.601
You plan on living
with the Commander...

14:25.772 --> 14:27.609
as husband and wife?

14:30.823 --> 14:32.535
As a family. Of course.

14:35.082 --> 14:37.336
Can you explain that
to me, Serena?

14:43.181 --> 14:45.018
I don't believe I have to.

14:48.441 --> 14:49.903
[door opens]

14:54.036 --> 14:55.665
[door closes]

15:11.446 --> 15:12.907
[woman] All right,
bud, here we are.

15:12.991 --> 15:14.786
You can play with your ball
in the yard.

15:14.870 --> 15:15.747
[boy] Okay.

15:24.388 --> 15:25.933
‐Hey.
‐[Emily] Hi.

15:28.522 --> 15:30.192
We're enjoying
very fine weather.

15:30.275 --> 15:31.945
Pious little shit.

15:34.576 --> 15:35.870
Oliver, aren't you freezing?

15:35.953 --> 15:36.997
[Oliver] No.

15:37.498 --> 15:40.546
They're impervious to cold.
Someone did a study.

15:43.176 --> 15:45.180
So, there wasn't anybody there,

15:46.349 --> 15:48.436
in the courtroom,
for your testimony?

15:48.521 --> 15:49.981
No. They taped it.

15:50.733 --> 15:52.612
They'd never stand
for that in Gilead.

15:52.695 --> 15:53.656
No.

15:54.240 --> 15:57.037
They prefer their justice
with a personal touch.

15:57.121 --> 15:58.624
‐Nooses and such.
‐Yeah.

15:58.707 --> 15:59.751
[chuckles]

16:01.129 --> 16:02.339
My mom...

16:02.422 --> 16:04.176
My mom used to always tell me

16:04.260 --> 16:06.389
if you wanna know
what they believe in?

16:06.472 --> 16:10.105
Remember that they bought
a shitload

16:10.188 --> 16:13.153
more copies of the Old Testament
than the New.

16:13.737 --> 16:15.783
‐It's a much better read.
‐Mmm.

16:16.367 --> 16:18.037
The righteous will rejoice
in vengeance

16:18.121 --> 16:21.460
and wash their feet
in the blood of the wicked.

16:21.545 --> 16:23.006
It's good stuff.

16:23.089 --> 16:24.341
[chuckles]

16:33.276 --> 16:35.948
Emily, I really want
to let go of him.

16:37.159 --> 16:38.494
‐Fred?
‐Yeah.

16:41.375 --> 16:42.879
I want to focus on my family.

16:42.962 --> 16:47.012
I want to focus on Hannah
and my Nichole.

16:49.643 --> 16:51.020
And Luke.

16:59.078 --> 17:02.209
A good mother
would be able to let go.

17:04.631 --> 17:06.384
A good mother.

17:09.557 --> 17:12.229
A good mother
would be able to let go.

18:09.761 --> 18:10.930
[door opens]

18:16.273 --> 18:17.234
[door closes]

18:17.694 --> 18:19.488
[Commander Fred]
Blessed be the fruit.

18:34.978 --> 18:37.023
What an unexpected pleasure.

18:38.067 --> 18:39.361
Hello, Fred.

18:40.531 --> 18:42.367
Blessed evening, June.

18:42.451 --> 18:44.413
May I call you June?

18:46.793 --> 18:48.589
That is my name.

18:48.672 --> 18:49.924
Yes, it is.

18:55.101 --> 18:57.690
Always was my name, actually.

18:58.399 --> 18:59.694
Of course.

19:00.905 --> 19:04.036
Well, then, June,
why have you come?

19:07.794 --> 19:09.213
Well... [clears throat]

19:10.465 --> 19:13.471
I heard that you were
going to Geneva,

19:14.808 --> 19:15.976
so...

19:17.437 --> 19:19.818
I thought this might be
my last chance.

19:21.278 --> 19:22.405
Really?

19:23.199 --> 19:25.078
To wish me well? [scoffs]

19:25.161 --> 19:27.082
That doesn't sound
like our June.

19:38.229 --> 19:41.695
Out of respect,
I hold no ill will.

19:43.072 --> 19:45.786
Even after those things
you said in court.

19:52.257 --> 19:55.054
I think you can leave us alone.

19:55.138 --> 19:56.223
Thank you.

20:01.317 --> 20:02.360
[door closes]

20:09.458 --> 20:10.502
Mmm.

20:14.636 --> 20:16.598
Fred, I think we both know

20:18.309 --> 20:19.604
what happened.

20:20.313 --> 20:21.315
Yes, we do.

20:22.944 --> 20:24.279
I remember...

20:27.954 --> 20:29.247
quite well.

20:31.503 --> 20:34.759
I do understand
that you had to...

20:36.805 --> 20:39.393
frame things
in front of the judge.

20:41.313 --> 20:42.984
And your husband.

20:49.706 --> 20:50.708
Yeah,

20:53.505 --> 20:54.966
there were...

20:59.474 --> 21:03.065
discomforts in my house,
I know, for both of us.

21:03.149 --> 21:05.319
More for you, of course.

21:08.451 --> 21:12.918
And for that I do have
deep regrets.

21:14.212 --> 21:15.131
[scoffs]

21:15.841 --> 21:17.845
I don't know that I was...

21:20.224 --> 21:25.861
able to fully appreciate
your situation until now.

21:30.537 --> 21:32.666
As a father, to...

21:33.710 --> 21:36.674
have my son
taken away from me would be

21:38.804 --> 21:40.223
unimaginable.

21:43.104 --> 21:46.736
You must have experienced
such terrible longing

21:46.820 --> 21:48.239
for your daughter.

21:51.370 --> 21:52.665
And, for that,

21:53.875 --> 21:55.002
I'm sorry.

21:58.593 --> 22:04.564
Truly, deeply sorry.

22:11.034 --> 22:12.621
[sobs]

22:28.570 --> 22:31.366
I didn't think
you'd ever say that.

22:31.450 --> 22:32.661
[exhales]

22:35.751 --> 22:36.920
[chuckles]

22:43.265 --> 22:44.476
[chuckles]

22:48.860 --> 22:50.530
[laughs]

23:05.184 --> 23:06.436
I need a drink.

23:07.898 --> 23:09.025
‐Of course.
‐[chuckles]

23:09.109 --> 23:10.236
[laughs]

23:10.319 --> 23:11.990
I could use one, too.

23:12.073 --> 23:13.367
[laughs]

23:26.226 --> 23:27.478
What we had,

23:31.236 --> 23:32.155
it was...

23:33.365 --> 23:35.119
vital. It was a...

23:36.664 --> 23:38.585
a relationship we

23:40.672 --> 23:42.467
both needed very badly.

23:43.511 --> 23:47.686
To survive in our own ways.

23:47.770 --> 23:50.232
I wouldn't call it love, but...

23:52.445 --> 23:55.577
there was something else,
something

23:57.539 --> 23:58.875
very strong.

23:58.958 --> 24:00.002
Yeah.

24:04.344 --> 24:06.849
Yeah, there was.

24:14.824 --> 24:15.992
It's funny.

24:16.619 --> 24:19.959
I do find myself missing her.

24:23.633 --> 24:24.718
Who?

24:26.138 --> 24:27.306
Offred.

24:32.358 --> 24:36.993
I realize that must
sound strange to you.

24:38.955 --> 24:40.166
No.

24:44.424 --> 24:45.468
[sniffles]

24:48.307 --> 24:49.935
I miss her, too.

24:55.864 --> 24:57.116
Some things,

24:58.661 --> 24:59.580
so much.

25:15.486 --> 25:17.156
I miss her strength.

25:24.337 --> 25:25.924
She was very special.

25:33.982 --> 25:34.942
Inspiring,

25:37.488 --> 25:38.783
in a way.

25:42.039 --> 25:43.083
Mmm.

25:51.976 --> 25:53.103
To Offred.

25:56.611 --> 25:59.073
To our Offred.

26:21.493 --> 26:22.411
[Luke] So, we're going to have

26:22.495 --> 26:24.541
some more police at the house
for a little while

26:24.625 --> 26:27.506
'cause Waterford's always gonna
have some crazies who,

26:27.589 --> 26:28.758
you know, wanna worship him.

26:28.841 --> 26:31.388
There's nothing
we can do about that, so...

26:31.722 --> 26:34.018
They can have Fred the Redeemer.

26:35.522 --> 26:37.024
I know what he is.

26:39.487 --> 26:40.907
Mmm‐hmm.

26:41.324 --> 26:44.707
Yeah, I get that. I get that.

26:47.378 --> 26:48.923
You want to stop
and get something?

26:49.006 --> 26:49.925
Like...

26:50.635 --> 26:51.762
should we just get some food?

26:51.846 --> 26:53.306
‐Do you want a beer?
‐[chuckles]

26:53.390 --> 26:55.060
How about a fucking beer?

26:55.520 --> 26:59.235
Ah, naw. I'm kinda tired.
I just want to go home.

26:59.318 --> 27:02.366
Home, like Boston home?

27:02.450 --> 27:05.122
We could...
we could get some Pepe's,

27:05.205 --> 27:07.209
‐catch a Sox game.
‐[chuckles]

27:07.293 --> 27:09.923
That'd, that'll be...
that would be fun.

27:12.052 --> 27:13.598
You know, someday...

27:17.229 --> 27:19.192
I'm going to put Fred
on the wall.

27:23.074 --> 27:24.202
June?

27:26.164 --> 27:28.753
June, they... they are
going to let him go.

27:28.836 --> 27:29.922
Okay?

27:30.422 --> 27:33.136
So, you gotta let it go.

27:36.392 --> 27:38.648
On the fucking wall.

27:41.820 --> 27:45.662
[breathing heavily]

27:55.598 --> 27:57.393
Ms. Osborn. Good morning.

27:57.476 --> 27:59.731
Fred's not gonna get out, Mark.

28:01.192 --> 28:04.783
I understand how difficult
this is to accept.

28:04.866 --> 28:06.662
You should probably change.

28:07.789 --> 28:09.125
We're going to need your car.

28:11.170 --> 28:12.632
Ms. Osborn...

28:12.716 --> 28:13.884
You're gonna help me.

28:14.511 --> 28:16.055
We're not having a discussion.

28:16.139 --> 28:17.016
No,

28:17.976 --> 28:20.105
we are going to
have this conversation.

28:20.188 --> 28:21.441
Yes, we are.

28:21.525 --> 28:24.948
Because we are human beings,
trying to work together.

28:25.032 --> 28:27.077
Because we have
respect for each other.

28:27.161 --> 28:28.581
I mean,

28:29.875 --> 28:31.670
this is my home.

28:31.754 --> 28:34.551
You have my cell, my email.

28:34.635 --> 28:39.435
This is fucking... inappropriate
and completely unacceptable.

28:41.857 --> 28:46.240
[breathing heavily]

28:48.036 --> 28:50.165
I apologize for my tone.

28:54.966 --> 28:56.386
No need. You're right.

28:57.597 --> 28:58.808
I'm sorry.

29:08.911 --> 29:11.165
You know, Gilead turns you
into a bit of a cunt.

29:22.229 --> 29:23.398
I just...

29:29.034 --> 29:31.915
I need Fred
to get what he deserves.

29:33.878 --> 29:35.338
I understand.

29:37.844 --> 29:39.096
I just...

29:39.806 --> 29:42.478
I don't know
what I can do for you.

29:42.562 --> 29:44.148
Just listen.

29:44.900 --> 29:46.068
Please?

29:47.446 --> 29:48.949
Give me a ride,

29:50.243 --> 29:51.622
and just listen.

30:29.488 --> 30:31.158
You spoke to him directly?

30:31.242 --> 30:33.706
Yeah. The embassy
arranged the call.

30:33.789 --> 30:36.085
And he personally
guaranteed safe passage?

30:36.962 --> 30:38.464
Yeah. He did.

30:40.010 --> 30:41.137
All right.

30:50.865 --> 30:54.246
June Osborn.
As I live and breathe.

30:57.795 --> 30:59.131
Joseph.

31:04.976 --> 31:06.479
Thank you for coming.

31:07.230 --> 31:09.778
Oh, it was
such an intriguing offer.

31:09.861 --> 31:11.447
How could I resist?

31:14.203 --> 31:16.374
So, you want to
make a deal for Fred.

31:16.457 --> 31:18.461
Deal. He's not a...

31:19.673 --> 31:23.346
used Subaru.
He is my fellow countryman.

31:24.390 --> 31:27.104
Lost and far from home.

31:29.693 --> 31:31.571
Mr. Tuello, we'd...

31:31.655 --> 31:34.577
we just want to get
Commander Waterford... Fred

31:36.497 --> 31:37.792
home.

31:38.919 --> 31:40.715
I'm sure you would.

31:40.798 --> 31:43.261
Waterford is talking,
and you're scared.

31:43.344 --> 31:46.267
No, he's having
a crisis of faith.

31:46.350 --> 31:51.068
Be a mistake
to rely on his words.

31:51.485 --> 31:53.072
Thank you for the warning.

31:53.156 --> 31:55.368
You said he's been talking,
he's already been helpful.

31:55.452 --> 31:56.788
Yes, he has.

31:57.164 --> 32:00.045
And we hope he will
continue to be an asset.

32:01.297 --> 32:05.388
We would be willing to discuss
a range of

32:05.472 --> 32:07.434
monetary policy changes.

32:12.444 --> 32:15.200
Commander Lawrence,
you are wasting your time.

32:15.283 --> 32:16.620
Joseph.

32:17.663 --> 32:19.124
Don't be a dick.

32:20.168 --> 32:21.253
It was worth a shot.

32:21.337 --> 32:24.134
Uh, I do have another offer.

32:25.888 --> 32:27.474
A trade, if you will.

32:28.727 --> 32:30.815
Uh, Michelle Torrence,

32:30.898 --> 32:36.283
Courtney Tan, Adrienne Gedney.

32:36.367 --> 32:38.622
Twenty‐two of these women

32:38.705 --> 32:42.588
worked with the Resistance,
isn't that right?

32:45.719 --> 32:46.763
Yes.

32:49.226 --> 32:51.731
We thought they were dead,
most of them.

32:52.315 --> 32:55.488
Well, good news, then.

32:56.115 --> 32:57.869
And you can save them.

32:58.244 --> 33:00.749
And we can bring
our brother home.

33:07.429 --> 33:09.726
I get that Fred Waterford
is giving you information

33:09.809 --> 33:11.688
that you feel will save lives.

33:12.857 --> 33:13.901
I get that.

33:15.821 --> 33:18.619
But these are the lives
you're trying to save.

33:18.702 --> 33:21.248
And you cannot say
that Fred Waterford

33:21.332 --> 33:23.169
is worth more than these women,

33:23.754 --> 33:25.215
these 22 women.

33:26.551 --> 33:28.095
You can't say that.

33:37.364 --> 33:39.076
I will take it to my boss.

33:39.159 --> 33:40.453
Oh, good.

33:43.627 --> 33:44.754
Thank you.

33:52.937 --> 33:54.983
Glad you haven't
lost your touch.

34:04.126 --> 34:06.171
It won't be enough, you know.

34:08.467 --> 34:09.554
Whatever

34:10.388 --> 34:12.392
happens to him if we get him

34:13.687 --> 34:15.524
won't be enough for you.

34:23.665 --> 34:25.209
God bless you, Joseph.

34:33.769 --> 34:36.482
[Luke] No, look,
if they make that trade,

34:36.566 --> 34:38.361
Waterford is going to
end up in Gilead.

34:38.444 --> 34:41.033
They will put him on trial,
and he will go to jail.

34:42.745 --> 34:44.331
‐Or the Colonies.
‐Right.

34:44.414 --> 34:47.045
Not free but still alive.

34:47.128 --> 34:48.507
[Rita] At least
a trial is proper.

34:49.424 --> 34:50.969
Justice of a sort.

34:53.057 --> 34:55.061
[Emily] Would we ever know
what happened to him?

34:55.144 --> 34:56.105
[Moira] I don't care.

34:57.399 --> 34:58.819
I just want him gone.

34:59.821 --> 35:02.033
I've spent too much of my life
thinking about him.

35:02.660 --> 35:04.246
I just want him gone.

35:11.678 --> 35:12.847
What do you want?

35:19.025 --> 35:20.904
I want him to be afraid.

35:25.706 --> 35:27.960
Because I was afraid
for so long.

35:32.469 --> 35:33.764
How afraid?

35:36.059 --> 35:38.189
Like in the woods
when I was caught.

35:44.034 --> 35:45.453
And they took Hannah.

35:53.385 --> 35:54.555
More than that.

35:55.766 --> 35:56.810
Mmm.

36:02.237 --> 36:04.366
I want him to be
scared to death.

36:18.687 --> 36:19.939
[indistinct]

36:20.022 --> 36:21.191
...he is out of the country.

36:21.275 --> 36:24.072
As I said. Yes.

36:25.324 --> 36:26.661
Sure, call me back.

36:28.497 --> 36:30.001
It's the I. C. C. press relations.

36:30.084 --> 36:32.005
She's the competent one
if you can believe it.

36:32.088 --> 36:33.173
Oh.

36:34.719 --> 36:36.723
You're off to the airport?

36:36.806 --> 36:38.017
Yes.

36:38.350 --> 36:39.436
And...

36:40.522 --> 36:42.776
I'll return a free man.

36:42.860 --> 36:46.116
A husband and a father.

36:49.247 --> 36:52.630
It really is a miracle, Fred.
What you've done.

36:54.257 --> 36:59.936
I am guided by His hand
and my love for the two of you.

37:03.652 --> 37:04.862
Thank you.

37:09.079 --> 37:10.958
Here is your airplane reading.

37:12.043 --> 37:14.924
I've marked the changes
in the court documents,

37:15.007 --> 37:17.261
and here are
the revised appendices.

37:17.721 --> 37:18.807
Oof.

37:18.890 --> 37:20.727
I imagine this means
I won't have time

37:20.811 --> 37:23.315
to watch any in‐flight movies.

37:23.399 --> 37:24.694
I wish you could come with me.

37:25.111 --> 37:28.242
We'll have to divide
and conquer for a while.

37:35.507 --> 37:36.884
Call me when you land.

37:39.055 --> 37:40.642
Yes. Um,

37:41.644 --> 37:44.149
we could try to Zoom.

37:44.817 --> 37:46.028
I'd like to see you.

37:47.781 --> 37:49.409
Sure, Fred. We can Zoom.

37:52.081 --> 37:54.044
[phone ringing]

37:56.591 --> 37:58.135
Serena Joy.

37:58.218 --> 38:00.766
It's my conference call.
Have a safe flight.

38:00.849 --> 38:01.934
Praise be.

38:04.774 --> 38:06.401
Yes, yes. I'm here.

38:08.280 --> 38:09.240
Yes.

38:12.205 --> 38:14.000
Who else are we waiting for?

38:16.923 --> 38:20.262
Yes, well, I was hoping we could
discuss the case strategy.

38:21.808 --> 38:23.143
Given our last conversation,

38:23.227 --> 38:25.147
I thought it would be
appropriate.

38:26.191 --> 38:27.151
Good afternoon, Commander.

38:27.235 --> 38:28.780
Good afternoon, Michael.

38:28.863 --> 38:29.782
Your car'll be right up.

38:29.865 --> 38:31.368
Praise be. Oh, would you...

38:31.451 --> 38:32.538
‐Sure.
‐[Mark] Yes, he's here.

38:32.621 --> 38:34.959
Thank you. Very much, ma'am.

38:37.255 --> 38:39.885
Ah, Mr. Tuello, what a surprise.

38:39.969 --> 38:42.431
I was told you wouldn't be
coming along to Geneva.

38:43.016 --> 38:44.728
You're not going to Geneva.

38:47.191 --> 38:48.611
What are you talking about?

38:51.491 --> 38:52.953
What is this posturing?

38:53.036 --> 38:55.166
I want to speak
to my lawyer immediately!

38:55.249 --> 38:56.836
You no longer have a lawyer.

38:58.506 --> 38:59.842
Commander Waterford,
the I. C. C. Court...

38:59.925 --> 39:00.969
‐You liar!
‐...have ruled you

39:01.052 --> 39:02.471
‐unfit for leniency...
‐You two‐faced fucking coward!

39:02.556 --> 39:03.558
They have turned
your dispensation...

39:03.641 --> 39:04.434
‐You're a liar!
‐...over to...

39:04.518 --> 39:06.146
‐...the American government.
‐Two‐faced fucking liar!

39:06.229 --> 39:07.023
You are now in my custody.

39:07.106 --> 39:08.150
This is absurd.

39:11.281 --> 39:12.743
This is insanity!

39:12.826 --> 39:16.291
I have rights!
I'm a man, and I have rights!

39:16.374 --> 39:18.253
Do you hear me, Tuello?

39:19.965 --> 39:21.468
[knocks twice on door]

39:43.554 --> 39:47.019
[indistinct conversation]

39:54.450 --> 39:56.454
[helicopter hovering]

40:00.462 --> 40:02.216
[dogs barking]

40:14.992 --> 40:16.119
This way.

40:17.413 --> 40:19.543
Mr. Tuello, we had an agreement.

40:19.626 --> 40:21.630
We're exercising a provision
within that agreement.

40:21.714 --> 40:24.177
How, by taking me to some
dark road to be executed?

40:24.260 --> 40:26.891
No, you're going home,
Commander.

40:26.974 --> 40:28.519
Tell them we're ready.
Twenty‐two coming back.

40:28.603 --> 40:29.897
Check the names,
get 'em on the bus.

40:29.980 --> 40:32.026
I want 'em on the move
as quickly as possible.

40:32.109 --> 40:33.571
‐Yes, sir.
‐I got him.

40:34.531 --> 40:35.867
Come on.

40:36.660 --> 40:41.879
[helicopter hovering]

40:41.962 --> 40:45.010
A prisoner exchange? You can't.

40:45.678 --> 40:47.933
Your government
has made us a guarantee

40:48.016 --> 40:49.102
that you will be tried under

40:49.185 --> 40:51.147
the formal Gilead
justice system.

40:51.941 --> 40:54.070
You helped write
those laws, didn't you?

40:54.153 --> 40:56.032
It worked for these women,
now it's your turn.

40:56.116 --> 40:59.205
You'll have to face God
with this decision, Mr. Tuello.

40:59.288 --> 41:01.710
He'll be
the judge of you, not I.

41:01.794 --> 41:04.048
He knows what's in your heart.

41:04.132 --> 41:07.556
He knows what you desire,
what you covet!

41:07.973 --> 41:09.768
Goodbye, Commander.

41:11.146 --> 41:12.398
Let's go!

41:13.442 --> 41:15.738
[helicopter hovering]

41:20.205 --> 41:22.209
[breathing unsteadily]

41:31.311 --> 41:33.816
[police sirens wailing]

41:33.900 --> 41:34.860
[Lawrence] Fred.

41:36.989 --> 41:39.620
Praise be. You're home safe.

41:41.289 --> 41:43.961
The nation's prayers
have been answered.

41:44.505 --> 41:45.757
Praise be.

41:46.466 --> 41:47.636
[scoffs]

41:51.059 --> 41:52.771
Everything I did,

41:54.273 --> 41:56.319
I did to protect my family.

41:59.743 --> 42:01.622
I won't apologize.

42:03.124 --> 42:04.210
All right.

42:23.290 --> 42:24.375
Nick?

42:24.751 --> 42:27.214
Commander. Commander Lawrence.

42:28.718 --> 42:30.930
The Eyes will take
the prisoner into custody.

42:33.811 --> 42:34.813
Nick.

42:34.896 --> 42:37.359
Nick, what are you doing? Son?

42:39.113 --> 42:41.326
If I object,
will it make a difference?

42:41.409 --> 42:42.662
No, sir.

42:43.706 --> 42:44.750
At the border, I'm afraid

42:44.833 --> 42:46.587
the Eyes maintain
tactical control.

42:48.507 --> 42:49.509
Well.

42:53.308 --> 42:55.855
He seems to have us
over a barrel.

42:58.360 --> 42:59.946
Go in grace, Fred.

43:08.923 --> 43:09.966
Nick?

43:10.384 --> 43:11.553
Son, this is wrong.

43:13.098 --> 43:17.022
Son, you will regret this.
Son, you'll regret this.

43:17.106 --> 43:19.402
Son. Nick, listen to me.

43:20.112 --> 43:20.988
Nick!

43:24.120 --> 43:25.540
Where are we going, son?

43:25.957 --> 43:28.378
Where are we going? Nick!

43:56.392 --> 43:58.731
[inhales deeply, unsteadily]

44:01.402 --> 44:03.448
[brakes screech softly]

44:18.771 --> 44:22.862
You, uh... You, Nick,
you know this is all wrong.

44:22.946 --> 44:24.198
Mmm? Where are we?

44:24.281 --> 44:26.745
Are we even in Gilead anymore?
Hmm?

44:26.829 --> 44:27.747
Just keep moving, Commander.

44:27.831 --> 44:30.753
What jurisdiction
do you have to hold me? Hmm?

44:30.837 --> 44:33.007
No! I have questions
and they deserve...

44:33.091 --> 44:34.803
[cries out] Fuck!

44:36.389 --> 44:38.017
[spits, gasps]

44:38.434 --> 44:40.188
You'll regret this, son.

44:41.274 --> 44:42.902
You know this is wrong.

44:43.486 --> 44:44.823
Keep moving.

44:44.906 --> 44:46.535
Tell me where I am.

44:50.458 --> 44:52.379
You're in No Man's Land,
Commander.

44:55.928 --> 44:57.014
My God.

44:59.476 --> 45:01.188
Do not be deceived.

45:02.441 --> 45:03.944
God is not to be mocked.

45:05.823 --> 45:08.453
For whatever man sows,
so shall he reap.

45:09.998 --> 45:11.585
You did this
to yourself, Commander.

45:11.668 --> 45:13.797
That's a lie. That's idiocy.

45:14.256 --> 45:15.676
Nick, son?

45:16.762 --> 45:18.933
Help me. Help me.

45:19.851 --> 45:21.855
[breathing heavily]

45:30.957 --> 45:32.794
Fuck. What the...

45:33.336 --> 45:35.633
What the fuck is this?

45:37.344 --> 45:38.639
It's fucking sick.

45:43.524 --> 45:44.818
Thank you.

46:06.611 --> 46:08.699
[breathing heavily]

46:08.782 --> 46:13.625
You are a good and kind woman.

46:15.211 --> 46:16.840
And a mother.

46:47.067 --> 46:48.319
Choose.

46:56.670 --> 46:58.590
I know you can't shoot me.

47:04.226 --> 47:05.563
All right.

47:11.658 --> 47:13.244
[whistles]

47:25.268 --> 47:28.817
Offred, please. No.

47:31.488 --> 47:34.954
I have a son! A son!

47:51.905 --> 47:53.032
Run.

48:17.790 --> 48:18.792
[gasps]

48:30.983 --> 48:35.701
[June] It has to look like love.
That's what he needs.

48:35.784 --> 48:39.082
Pretend you like it.
Pretend you love it.

48:40.669 --> 48:42.130
Pretend you want it.

48:43.257 --> 48:47.683
He is your Commander.
He is your whole world.

48:49.645 --> 48:53.235
Don't run. Don't kick.

48:53.904 --> 48:55.490
Don't scream.

48:57.745 --> 49:00.249
[breathing unsteadily]

49:00.333 --> 49:01.460
[gasps]

49:28.097 --> 49:30.226
[exhales]

[grunting]

49:57.280 --> 49:59.827
[screaming and grunting]

50:08.678 --> 50:10.264
Don't bite.

50:11.768 --> 50:12.895
Don't.

50:13.479 --> 50:14.481
Bite.

50:14.565 --> 50:16.528

[Nichole cooing]

54:23.521 --> 54:25.859
Hi, sweetie. Hi.

54:28.030 --> 54:29.032
[chuckles]

54:32.413 --> 54:33.833
[Nichole babbles]

54:39.302 --> 54:43.143
Come here, baby. Come here.

54:47.611 --> 54:48.738
Hi.

54:50.073 --> 54:54.207
Hi. There she is.
There's my girl.

54:56.252 --> 54:58.256
Here's my girl.

55:01.680 --> 55:03.183
[door opens]

55:03.810 --> 55:05.187
Who's that?

55:07.274 --> 55:08.443
June?

55:13.119 --> 55:14.540
I know.

55:19.675 --> 55:20.885
I'm sorry.

55:37.293 --> 55:39.380
Just give me five minutes, okay?

55:41.719 --> 55:44.056
Just give me
five minutes with her,

55:44.850 --> 55:46.311
then I'll go.

55:56.707 --> 56:01.299
Mommy loves you.
Mommy loves you so much.
