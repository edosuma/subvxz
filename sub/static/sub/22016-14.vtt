WEBVTT

00:01.066 --> 00:02.434
Hey, Phil.

00:02.501 --> 00:04.035
<i>Jay, where are you?
What are you doing?</i>

00:04.103 --> 00:05.303
I'm just walking
into my house.

00:05.370 --> 00:07.272
<i>Stop! Don't you take
another step!</i>

00:07.339 --> 00:09.024
What the hell are you
talking about?

00:09.091 --> 00:10.625
<i>Claire just told me your</i>
<i>Valentine's plans</i>
<i>for Gloria.</i>

00:10.693 --> 00:12.710
<i>You're walking
into a buzz saw!</i>

00:15.714 --> 00:16.965
Get in.

00:20.386 --> 00:21.987
What am I looking
at here?

00:22.054 --> 00:23.438
Nothing.
Oh, it's a role-playing thing
we do on Valentine's.

00:23.506 --> 00:25.640
It bumps the lovemaking up
a notch.
Phil, why?

00:25.708 --> 00:27.174
Gloria is mad at you.

00:27.259 --> 00:28.693
If you walk in there
with some lame gift,

00:28.761 --> 00:30.812
she will bite your head
right off, mister.

00:30.880 --> 00:31.612
Well, you worried
for nothing.

00:31.680 --> 00:33.131
I bought her
a nice cookie,

00:33.182 --> 00:35.683
and the biggest
Mylar balloon they sold
at the grocery store.

00:35.751 --> 00:37.636
Wake up, man!
You're losing her!

00:37.703 --> 00:39.020
When did you talk
to Gloria?

00:39.087 --> 00:40.488
This afternoon.

00:40.556 --> 00:42.524
I'm just taking Claire up
to the overlook on Mulholland

00:42.592 --> 00:44.642
for a little old-school
make-out sesh.

00:44.710 --> 00:46.260
Oh, Phil.

00:46.328 --> 00:48.296
You're so good
at Valentine things...

00:48.364 --> 00:51.766
unlike some ungrateful,
selfish men

00:51.833 --> 00:55.920
that don't
appreciate women!

00:55.988 --> 00:57.122
You need to step it up
tonight.

00:57.190 --> 00:58.289
How?

00:58.357 --> 01:00.058
By dressing up in costumes
like weirdos?

01:00.125 --> 01:01.943
It's not weird, Dad.
It's fun.

01:02.011 --> 01:03.828
Yeah. Tonight,
we get to be 17 again,

01:03.896 --> 01:05.312
when we were just
a couple of innocent,

01:05.379 --> 01:07.799
wide-eyed virgins.

01:07.866 --> 01:09.301
Shut up.

01:09.368 --> 01:10.735
I'm not doing it.

01:10.802 --> 01:11.986
Today, when Gloria found out
what we were doing,

01:12.054 --> 01:13.521
she said,
"Damn it, Phil.

01:13.589 --> 01:14.756
You are so good
at Valentine's.

01:14.824 --> 01:17.124
I wish Jay
was as sexy as you."

01:17.193 --> 01:18.009
She never said that.

01:18.077 --> 01:19.127
I'm paraphrasing.

01:19.195 --> 01:20.161
Okay, call Gloria,

01:20.229 --> 01:21.429
tell her to meet you
at a hotel bar,

01:21.497 --> 01:24.516
and then you show up
as some romantic character.

01:24.583 --> 01:25.667
Who would I be?
Anybody.

01:25.734 --> 01:27.802
Think of the most
exotic person you can.

01:27.870 --> 01:28.653
General Eisenhower,

01:28.720 --> 01:30.505
the father
of the American freeway.

01:30.572 --> 01:32.990
You're gonna want to think
a little sexier than that.

01:33.058 --> 01:34.826
You have not
seen the right photos.

01:48.490 --> 01:50.942
What are you doing?
I thought he was taking
you out to dinner.

01:51.010 --> 01:52.894
I'm pre-eating
so I don't look like a pig.

01:52.962 --> 01:54.946
Oh, please tell me
you don't eat on dates.

01:55.014 --> 01:56.164
Who's the lucky guy?

01:56.232 --> 01:59.000
Oh, this professor
from Alex's college.

01:59.068 --> 02:01.018
Normally, I wouldn't go out
with a guy like that,

02:01.086 --> 02:02.770
but there's something
about him.

02:02.838 --> 02:05.073
"Something about him"?
He's a genius.

02:05.140 --> 02:07.392
He's one of the most respected
minds on campus,

02:07.394 --> 02:09.077
who also happens to look like
the protagonist

02:09.162 --> 02:10.511
from a Jane Austen novel.

02:10.579 --> 02:12.296
He's totally
out of your league.

02:12.665 --> 02:14.199
Oh, well, now
you're being crazy.

02:14.266 --> 02:15.534
Are you into him
or something?

02:15.601 --> 02:16.751
No! I'm just
genuinely concerned

02:16.818 --> 02:18.986
you're going to embarrass
yourself or me.

02:19.054 --> 02:22.022
At least look up the
difference between
astrology and astronomy.

02:22.090 --> 02:23.107
Okay, alls I know is,

02:23.175 --> 02:25.443
is that you're being
a real Capricorn right now.

02:25.511 --> 02:26.995
The sun revolves
around the Earth,

02:27.062 --> 02:28.863
and not you.

02:28.930 --> 02:31.516
I cannot believe we got
into this restaurant.

02:31.584 --> 02:33.134
I know.
Oh, you know what?

02:33.202 --> 02:34.635
Let's take a picture
and use Facebook the
way it was intended.

02:34.720 --> 02:36.904
Oh, to find out how racist
our high-school friends are?

02:36.972 --> 02:39.858
No, to make people
in our lives
feel worse about their lives.

02:39.925 --> 02:41.442
Hey!

02:41.510 --> 02:42.844
Gentlemen.

02:42.911 --> 02:44.362
Your table's being set up
right now.

02:44.430 --> 02:45.796
Okay.

02:45.864 --> 02:47.148
Oh, my G-- No.
What?

02:47.215 --> 02:48.783
Th-That's Luke.
No. We ca--

02:48.850 --> 02:50.284
No, we can't sit next to --
I'm s--
We can't sit there.

02:50.352 --> 02:52.253
Can we have a --
Can we have a different table?

02:52.321 --> 02:53.371
I'm sorry, not tonight.
Um...

02:53.439 --> 02:56.841
If you guys don't want it,
I have 10 other people who do.

02:56.909 --> 02:58.309
Okay.
You know what?

02:58.377 --> 02:59.994
Tonight was supposed to be
a romantic night.

03:00.061 --> 03:01.363
I-I don't want to watch him

03:01.430 --> 03:04.365
make his sweaty moves
on his conquest of the week.

03:04.367 --> 03:05.300
And some of them buy it.

03:05.367 --> 03:06.484
Under what gas leak is

03:06.552 --> 03:08.336
he finding these
brain-dead bimbos?

03:08.421 --> 03:10.237
And have you heard
how mean he's gotten?

03:10.305 --> 03:11.605
The other day,
he called us "catty."

03:11.673 --> 03:13.040
He called <i> us</i> catty?
Yeah.

03:13.125 --> 03:14.559
You sure he wasn't talking
about the dead cat on his head

03:14.627 --> 03:16.594
he calls a haircut?
Oh, my --

03:16.661 --> 03:17.679
Hey, guys!

03:17.747 --> 03:19.864
Hi!
Hey, Luke!
What a coincidence.

03:19.931 --> 03:22.250
I think it's nice that
we're helping out

03:22.318 --> 03:23.485
Dad and Gloria tonight.

03:23.552 --> 03:24.902
I know. I'm just
a little bummed

03:24.970 --> 03:26.371
that we're stuck here,
watching Joe,

03:26.438 --> 03:29.023
when we could be messing
around in a Trans Am.

03:29.091 --> 03:30.842
Or...did we just

03:30.910 --> 03:32.910
take it up
a notch, huh?

03:32.978 --> 03:35.713
I'm the foxy babysitter.
The kid's asleep.

03:35.781 --> 03:37.081
You are the foxy bad boy

03:37.149 --> 03:39.450
who sneaks over
with some wine coolers...

03:39.502 --> 03:41.753
Oh, radical.

03:41.821 --> 03:43.988
Now that I'm six,
I like girls,

03:44.056 --> 03:46.257
but I <i> love</i> two girls --

03:46.325 --> 03:48.927
The Little Mermaid
and Claire.

03:51.630 --> 03:54.031
Oh. Joe.
W-What are you doing up?

03:54.099 --> 03:57.468
Hello, Claire.
I made this for you.

03:57.536 --> 03:58.452
Oh, my goodness.

03:58.520 --> 04:00.905
Look,
it's a Valentine.

04:00.972 --> 04:03.207
It's two love bugs.

04:03.275 --> 04:04.726
Aww.

04:04.793 --> 04:06.077
<i>Two</i> love bugs.

04:06.145 --> 04:07.696
Three's a crowd.

04:07.763 --> 04:08.780
Hmm.

04:14.803 --> 04:15.687
Hey, how can I help you?

04:15.771 --> 04:18.139
I am Gigi DeLaroca,
businesswoman.

04:18.207 --> 04:22.644
Life has tried to break me,
but it has only teach me.

04:22.711 --> 04:23.978
So, you want a drink?

04:24.046 --> 04:27.148
The lady will
have Campari and soda.

04:27.216 --> 04:28.333
Hello, sir.

04:28.400 --> 04:30.418
I have never had
that drink.

04:30.486 --> 04:32.953
Well, no one "Camparis"
to you.

04:33.089 --> 04:34.488
Very clever.

04:34.556 --> 04:37.141
I am Gigi DeLaroca,
businesswoman.

04:37.209 --> 04:38.927
I am Raoul Matadore.

04:38.994 --> 04:41.062
I own this hotel.
May I?

04:41.130 --> 04:42.513
Of course, Mr. Matadore.

04:42.581 --> 04:44.616
Like Andy Garcia in
"Ocean's Eleven."

04:44.684 --> 04:46.134
I don't think
you have to explain.

04:46.202 --> 04:47.018
Right. Um, you talk.

04:47.186 --> 04:48.586
No, I mean, um...
Thank you.

04:48.654 --> 04:50.405
Tell me about you.

04:50.473 --> 04:52.506
What business are you in?
<i>Bueno.</i>

04:52.574 --> 04:53.991
Well, let's just say,

04:53.993 --> 04:56.677
I'm just a lady that works
in the evening.

04:56.745 --> 04:58.946
But I am not available
to any man.

04:58.998 --> 05:01.833
So charm me, Mr. Matadore.

05:01.900 --> 05:03.117
This hotel...

05:03.184 --> 05:05.603
has the finest closets
in all the land.

05:05.671 --> 05:09.774
We have lighted rods
and soft-close doors.

05:09.842 --> 05:11.159
I was once married
to a man

05:11.227 --> 05:13.911
that endlessly talked
about closet.

05:13.979 --> 05:15.880
You're boring me
very much.

05:15.948 --> 05:17.364
Okay, well, um...

05:17.432 --> 05:19.183
Um...

05:19.251 --> 05:21.870
I need one <i> secondo,</i> huh?

05:21.937 --> 05:24.555
Hotel <i> businesso,</i> huh?
<i>Bueno.</i>

05:30.179 --> 05:31.062
Oh, my goodness.

05:31.129 --> 05:32.513
The waitress --
She left a menu here.

05:32.581 --> 05:34.132
Now, I'm wondering
if we should have got --

05:34.199 --> 05:35.716
Oh, my God!
Where's his date?

05:35.784 --> 05:37.051
Do you think
he got stood up?

05:37.119 --> 05:38.836
Let me see that.
Right here.

05:38.904 --> 05:40.821
It's so embarrassing.
What do we even say?

05:40.873 --> 05:42.607
They're not
soundproof menus.

05:42.691 --> 05:44.125
Yeah.
She's standing me up.

05:44.193 --> 05:45.460
Women are impossible,
you know?

05:45.527 --> 05:46.528
For us, they are.

05:46.595 --> 05:48.529
Well, now,
I made it work once,

05:48.597 --> 05:51.332
although there was a Rob Lowe
poster behind her.

05:51.417 --> 05:53.451
You know what?
I say to heck with this gal.

05:53.518 --> 05:55.469
Mm-hmm.
Get back out there,
go to a bar!

05:55.537 --> 05:57.071
Yes!
I hear that.

05:57.139 --> 05:59.874
A guy like you,
great head of hair...
Yep.

05:59.942 --> 06:01.342
Nah, I'm too depressed.

06:01.409 --> 06:04.028
Besides, I prepaid
for my meal.
I guess I'll order.

06:04.096 --> 06:05.930
Just forget I'm here.

06:05.997 --> 06:09.217
Anyway...
happy Valentine's Day.

06:09.285 --> 06:10.785
Thanks.
You look so handsome.

06:10.852 --> 06:12.770
Ugh! This sucks.

06:15.674 --> 06:18.410
I can't believe I let you
talk me into doing this crap.

06:18.477 --> 06:20.678
- I need help!
<i>- It's okay.</i>

06:20.746 --> 06:22.830
Underneath it all,
it's just you and your wife.

06:22.898 --> 06:23.815
That's the problem.

06:23.882 --> 06:25.383
I don't know how I got her
to begin with.

06:25.450 --> 06:27.585
<i>And I'm starting to feel
if I can't pull this off,</i>

06:27.653 --> 06:30.037
she's gonna figure out
she got duped the first time.

06:30.105 --> 06:31.422
Let me start by saying
"thank you"

06:31.424 --> 06:32.973
for being so vulnerable
with me.

06:33.041 --> 06:34.392
I hate you.

06:34.460 --> 06:35.626
Also, I'm no expert
at this,

06:35.795 --> 06:38.696
but I have a friend
here who is.

06:38.747 --> 06:39.981
Clive Bixby here.

06:40.048 --> 06:41.899
How can I make your night
sexier?

06:41.967 --> 06:44.269
If I can't role-play with her,
I'm not doin' it with you.

06:44.336 --> 06:45.186
<i>Whatevs, Daddio.</i>

06:45.253 --> 06:46.654
I'm gonna give the phone
back to Philip.

06:46.722 --> 06:47.755
<i>Phil here.</i>

06:47.857 --> 06:50.124
Listen, it's all about
commitment and confidence.

06:50.192 --> 06:51.659
What's --
What's your character?

06:51.727 --> 06:54.144
Raoul Matadore, hotel owner,
like Andy Garcia --

06:54.212 --> 06:56.697
In "Ocean's Eleven" --
I love this for you!

06:56.765 --> 06:58.933
Did you go
with the timepiece?

06:59.001 --> 07:00.418
Yeah, I thought
at some moment,
I'd pull it out,

07:00.485 --> 07:01.819
smash it on the bar,
and say,

07:01.887 --> 07:04.739
"I want to remember the
exact moment I fell in love."

07:06.141 --> 07:07.392
I'm an idiot!
<i>No.</i>

07:07.459 --> 07:09.576
That silence is me picking
my jaw up off the floor.

07:09.644 --> 07:11.996
We're all walking,
and you're flying, mister.

07:12.064 --> 07:13.297
Seriously?
You think so?

07:13.365 --> 07:15.883
1,000%!
But don't take it from me.

07:15.951 --> 07:17.318
Clive again.

07:17.386 --> 07:20.254
Mr. Matadore,
I tip my turtleneck to ya.

07:20.889 --> 07:22.106
Hello?

07:22.174 --> 07:23.507
All right, no peeking.

07:23.575 --> 07:25.226
Oh, no peeking.

07:25.294 --> 07:27.028
I hope you're not
disappointed.

07:27.095 --> 07:30.148
Wow!
It's so pretty!

07:30.216 --> 07:31.632
You know what else
is pretty?

07:31.700 --> 07:33.234
Oh! Stop.

07:33.301 --> 07:34.302
Oh.

07:34.369 --> 07:35.987
Well, I was going to
say "Venus."

07:36.055 --> 07:38.806
But sure,
let's go with you.

07:38.873 --> 07:40.157
Come on, have a look.

07:40.225 --> 07:42.893
Ooh!

07:43.028 --> 07:44.562
Nope.

07:44.630 --> 07:46.497
Oh! Okay.
Yep.

07:46.565 --> 07:47.865
Wow!

07:47.933 --> 07:49.651
Yeah, there's a new moon,
so it's the perfect night

07:49.718 --> 07:51.919
to observe
faint star clusters.

07:51.987 --> 07:53.154
And --
And right in the middle,

07:53.221 --> 07:55.873
there's a variable star
that I discovered.

07:55.941 --> 07:57.524
It's right next
to a white dwarf.

07:57.592 --> 07:58.926
Oh, I don't think
you're allowed

07:58.994 --> 08:00.678
to say that anymore.

08:00.746 --> 08:02.546
Yes, tricky times
we live in.

08:02.714 --> 08:04.014
Wow, this is so cool.

08:04.082 --> 08:05.783
Right. Have a --
Have a think about this --

08:05.851 --> 08:10.104
There is a theory
that suggests
the universe is so large

08:10.172 --> 08:14.875
that everything
that <i> can</i> happen <i> is</i>
happening all the time.

08:14.894 --> 08:16.894
Do you smoke weed?

08:16.929 --> 08:18.263
Oh. No.

08:18.330 --> 08:20.698
Sor-- Sorry, I'm a little
obsessed with space.

08:20.765 --> 08:23.351
I-I built my first
Dobsonian telescope

08:23.418 --> 08:24.752
when I was 10.

08:24.770 --> 08:26.904
You made a telescope?

08:26.956 --> 08:29.590
The only thing I've ever made
was an ashtray for my mom

08:29.658 --> 08:31.826
that says,
"Rub your butt here."

08:31.893 --> 08:33.660
Oh, like cigarette butt.

08:33.745 --> 08:34.812
Yeah.

08:34.879 --> 08:37.365
What are you doing
next August 27th

08:37.433 --> 08:39.515
at, uh, 8:00 p.m.?

08:39.585 --> 08:41.318
I have no idea.
Why?

08:41.385 --> 08:44.154
NASA is giving me an award
for a radiation shield,

08:44.222 --> 08:46.957
and --
NASA's giving you
an award?

08:47.025 --> 08:48.393
I need a date.
There's no pressure.

08:48.460 --> 08:51.896
But it saved the lives
of a bunch of astronauts.

08:51.964 --> 08:53.881
Wow, you've done a lot.

08:53.949 --> 08:55.232
Well, I'm --
I'm sure you've had

08:55.300 --> 08:57.635
your share
of accomplishments.

08:57.686 --> 08:59.670
Oh, yeah!
Yeah, of course.

08:59.738 --> 09:02.039
Let's see.
There was, um...

09:02.107 --> 09:03.691
college...

09:03.809 --> 09:04.608
Uh-huh.

09:04.743 --> 09:06.560
Nope. Nope.
That is a --

09:06.628 --> 09:07.928
That is a bad road.

09:07.996 --> 09:09.847
Well, uh, uh, okay,
so professionally,

09:09.915 --> 09:12.216
I've been kind of sort of
dabbling in, like,

09:12.283 --> 09:13.501
a lot of different --
Pass.

09:13.568 --> 09:16.320
Um...I-I-I-I once flew

09:16.388 --> 09:18.005
next to the bass player
of The Killers.

09:18.073 --> 09:19.807
Uh, you know, it just kind of
looked like him.

09:19.874 --> 09:20.992
Is there a bathroom?

09:21.060 --> 09:22.309
Here, I'm just gonna
find it myself.

09:22.377 --> 09:23.577
No big deal. I'm fine.
I'm -- I'm great.

09:23.645 --> 09:25.262
I...

09:27.766 --> 09:29.800
So, are you seeing
anybody new?

09:29.868 --> 09:33.321
No, I didn't even make my mom
a Valentine's card this year.

09:33.388 --> 09:34.555
It's alarming that
I asked about dating,

09:34.640 --> 09:35.973
and you went right
to your mother.

09:38.377 --> 09:40.044
Hello?

09:40.112 --> 09:42.396
Alex,
it's Professor Fennerman.

09:42.464 --> 09:44.398
I'm sorry to bother you
on Valentine's.

09:44.450 --> 09:46.050
Uh, it's okay. Uh...

09:46.118 --> 09:47.835
Have you heard
from Haley?

09:47.903 --> 09:49.020
Isn't she with you?

09:49.088 --> 09:51.221
She was, and...
then she suddenly ran off.

09:51.289 --> 09:53.290
I think -- I think
I may have bored her

09:53.358 --> 09:54.875
to the point of fleeing.

09:54.943 --> 09:56.360
<i>You</i> could never
bore anyone.

09:56.428 --> 09:58.162
You know who's boring?
Professor Schaeffer.

09:58.330 --> 09:59.730
Agreed.
He's insufferable.

09:59.798 --> 10:01.332
He never stops
droning on.

10:01.399 --> 10:03.801
He's like the cosmic
microwave
background radiation.

10:05.954 --> 10:09.072
Because he's
the constant noise
you can't get rid of!

10:09.140 --> 10:10.724
Thank God somebody
gets me tonight.

10:12.093 --> 10:14.012
You know, I think
it might have been a bad idea,

10:14.079 --> 10:15.712
bringing her
to the observatory.

10:15.764 --> 10:17.848
I probably should have set
my sights on someone

10:17.916 --> 10:19.700
with whom I have
more in common.

10:19.768 --> 10:20.968
Do you know what I mean?

10:21.019 --> 10:22.903
I...think I do.

10:22.971 --> 10:24.789
Anyway, I think I'll wait here
a little longer,

10:24.856 --> 10:28.442
<i>take in the stars,
just in case she shows up.</i>

10:28.510 --> 10:29.927
Maybe she will.

10:29.994 --> 10:31.929
Thanks, Alex.

10:33.549 --> 10:34.582
Oh, my God.

10:34.649 --> 10:36.250
What?
Haley blew him off.

10:36.318 --> 10:37.985
I think he wants me to come
to the observatory

10:38.052 --> 10:39.353
to be with him.

10:39.420 --> 10:40.404
You have feelings
for this guy!

10:40.472 --> 10:41.355
Who wouldn't?!

10:41.423 --> 10:42.606
I mean, do you know
how hard it is

10:42.674 --> 10:44.041
to find
a good-looking genius?

10:44.093 --> 10:46.693
There's him, and when I put in
a little effort, me!

10:46.762 --> 10:48.045
Then go.

10:48.112 --> 10:49.997
I will.
Yeah, you will.

10:49.999 --> 10:51.198
a-and I'm gonna make
a Valentine for my mom.

10:51.266 --> 10:54.001
They're not the same!

10:54.068 --> 10:55.653
Okay, open --
open mine first.

10:55.721 --> 10:57.037
Oh.
It's -- It's a kimono.

10:57.105 --> 10:59.106
I took an online
origami class.

10:59.174 --> 11:01.091
Okay.
It's a haiku.

11:01.159 --> 11:03.343
Oh!
"Friend, lover, husband.

11:03.411 --> 11:05.479
My life started
when we met.

11:05.547 --> 11:06.914
You're my everything."

11:06.982 --> 11:08.015
Aww.
You are.

11:08.083 --> 11:10.184
Ooh, let's see what you wrote
in yours.

11:10.252 --> 11:12.320
Aww.
It's a tandem bicycle.

11:12.387 --> 11:14.004
Yeah.
It's so cute.

11:14.072 --> 11:15.923
"Happy V-Day.

11:15.991 --> 11:17.358
Love, M."

11:17.426 --> 11:18.859
And I thought my date
was cold.

11:18.927 --> 11:21.395
What? No.
Cam knows what I mean.

11:21.463 --> 11:23.464
Cam knows
you <i> are</i> mean?

11:23.531 --> 11:24.948
You were more effusive
about tonight's menu

11:24.967 --> 11:26.517
than you were
in my card.

11:26.584 --> 11:28.602
"The molten
chocolate cake looks
slutty and delicious."

11:28.670 --> 11:30.505
Would it kill you
to say that about me?

11:30.572 --> 11:32.306
What the hell?
Amanda <i> was</i> here.

11:32.373 --> 11:33.958
This picture you posted
on Facebook --

11:34.026 --> 11:37.878
She's right behind you.
Why would she just leave?

11:39.197 --> 11:40.665
Tonight was supposed to be
a romantic night.

11:40.715 --> 11:42.533
I don't want to watch Luke
make his sweaty moves

11:42.600 --> 11:43.834
on his conquest
of the week.

11:43.902 --> 11:45.269
Yeah,
and some of them buy it.

11:45.337 --> 11:46.504
Under what gas leak is

11:46.555 --> 11:48.739
he finding these
brain-dead bimbos?

11:48.807 --> 11:50.357
I know what happened.

11:50.425 --> 11:52.743
She walked in,
saw me for the first time,

11:52.811 --> 11:54.162
and thought I was hideous.

11:54.229 --> 11:56.213
I've really been struggling
with my hair lately.

11:56.281 --> 11:58.533
No, no, stop it.
You have great hair.

11:58.600 --> 12:00.751
If it worked
for Sheena Easton,
it can work for you.

12:00.819 --> 12:02.536
We spent
all this time texting.

12:02.604 --> 12:03.871
I thought we had
a real connection,

12:03.939 --> 12:06.891
like, we really got
each other.

12:06.958 --> 12:08.375
We couldn't let him
blame himself.

12:08.427 --> 12:10.545
But, uh...he took it
pretty well.

12:10.612 --> 12:11.929
You catty bitches!

12:11.997 --> 12:15.466
Luke, we love you,
but ever since
you hit puberty,

12:15.533 --> 12:17.834
you've been...
a little disgusting.
A little disgusting.

12:17.886 --> 12:19.637
Don't you think
I know that?!

12:19.705 --> 12:21.622
She was my chance
to turn it around.

12:21.690 --> 12:22.989
Okay, you know what?
Call her.

12:23.057 --> 12:24.741
We'll get on the phone,
we'll clear
the whole thing up.

12:24.809 --> 12:26.477
I called her.
She's not picking up.

12:26.544 --> 12:28.112
We're going
to her apartment.

12:28.179 --> 12:30.014
We messed this up,
we'll fix it.

12:30.082 --> 12:31.582
Before the cake arrives?

12:31.649 --> 12:33.917
I've been wanting
to bury my face
in that all night long.

12:33.986 --> 12:35.920
How can you not
hear this?

12:35.954 --> 12:38.105
Okay, Joey,
it's getting late.

12:38.173 --> 12:40.274
It's time to get you
up to bed.

12:40.342 --> 12:43.044
Can you do a quick
monster check first?

12:43.111 --> 12:45.479
Yes, I can.

12:47.665 --> 12:50.251
Phil, I can't sleep
without my teddy bear,

12:50.318 --> 12:52.270
and I left him
in my wagon.

12:52.337 --> 12:55.206
Can you get him?
I'm afraid of the dark.

12:55.273 --> 12:57.124
You got it, buddy.

13:00.361 --> 13:02.629
Joe?
What are you doing?

13:02.697 --> 13:04.448
Open the door.

13:04.516 --> 13:06.534
Fulgencio Joseph
Pritchett!

13:06.551 --> 13:07.885
Open the door!

13:09.837 --> 13:12.039
You let me in right now,
young man.

13:12.074 --> 13:14.091
Hey.
Not cool, Joe!

13:18.980 --> 13:22.733
Joe, what is going on
with this music?

13:22.801 --> 13:23.718
My God.

13:23.785 --> 13:25.319
Oh.
Where's Phil?

13:25.387 --> 13:28.005
Who knows
with that guy?

13:30.341 --> 13:31.808
Honey, what happened?

13:31.876 --> 13:33.811
Mini Casanova
locked me out.

13:33.879 --> 13:35.996
What?
That is enough.

13:36.064 --> 13:37.931
Joe, you are
a little boy,

13:37.999 --> 13:40.467
and you're going to bed
right now.

13:40.552 --> 13:43.304
You're a bad Valentine!

13:45.257 --> 13:46.957
Oh, no.

13:47.008 --> 13:48.476
I feel like the rest
of the Breakfast Club

13:48.543 --> 13:50.194
when they realized
Judd Nelson was

13:50.262 --> 13:52.980
more vulnerable
than they thought.
I...

13:53.047 --> 13:56.017
My hotel
in Ibiza was my favorite.

13:56.084 --> 13:57.934
I used to hang out
with Telly Savalas,

13:57.953 --> 13:59.353
Lyle Waggoner,

13:59.420 --> 14:01.305
but the scenery here

14:01.373 --> 14:03.807
makes me like this one
mucho more.

14:03.875 --> 14:06.143
You don't have to impress me
with money

14:06.211 --> 14:08.729
or name-dropping,
I think.

14:08.797 --> 14:09.996
I like you.

14:10.064 --> 14:11.298
Don't tell this
to my madam,

14:11.366 --> 14:14.267
but I cannot accept
any money from you.

14:14.335 --> 14:15.386
Excuse me, ma'am.

14:15.420 --> 14:16.637
Can I talk with you
for a moment?

14:19.958 --> 14:21.475
Yes?

14:21.543 --> 14:23.210
I'm gonna have to ask you
to leave now.

14:23.212 --> 14:24.411
Huh?

14:24.479 --> 14:25.863
The hotel owner
is very strict about...

14:25.930 --> 14:27.948
women who
do what you do.

14:28.016 --> 14:30.418
Ooh, you're gonna
take me to a room

14:30.485 --> 14:32.953
where the hotel owner
is going to give me

14:33.021 --> 14:35.389
a very tough,
sexy talking to?

14:35.456 --> 14:37.992
No, you're gonna leave,
or we're gonna
call the police.

14:38.059 --> 14:39.543
Yes, call the police.
Gloria --

14:39.611 --> 14:42.162
I've been a very, very
bad girl.

14:42.230 --> 14:43.597
This is not a part of it.

14:43.665 --> 14:46.517
Sir, she is not
a prostitute.

14:47.235 --> 14:48.502
This is my wife.

14:48.536 --> 14:50.003
That's what
they all say.

14:50.071 --> 14:50.955
Please.

14:51.973 --> 14:54.508
Yep, that's probably what
I would've said.

14:56.678 --> 14:58.245
Here she is.
Ciconi.

14:59.681 --> 15:01.031
What do you want?

15:01.099 --> 15:01.832
Oh, hi!
Here she is.

15:02.000 --> 15:03.467
Hey! Wow.

15:03.535 --> 15:04.918
You're actually hotter
than your picture.

15:04.986 --> 15:07.387
You know, let us talk.
Hi! So, we're --

15:07.455 --> 15:08.889
we're Luke's uncles.
We're Luke's uncles.

15:08.956 --> 15:10.658
- You're his uncles?
- Uh-huh.

15:10.809 --> 15:13.460
And you said he puts sweaty
moves on brain-dead bimbos?

15:13.528 --> 15:14.945
Okay, hadn't heard
the specifics.

15:15.013 --> 15:16.330
Okay, you know --
you know what?

15:16.398 --> 15:17.848
We d-- We didn't mean
any of that.

15:17.916 --> 15:19.917
We're gay,
and gays are snarky.

15:19.984 --> 15:21.101
It's a cultural thing.

15:21.169 --> 15:22.619
You know how, like,
you're Italian?

15:22.687 --> 15:24.572
Italians talk
a lot with their hands, right?

15:24.639 --> 15:25.673
And are much looser

15:25.741 --> 15:26.890
than one would imagine
for Catholics.

15:26.958 --> 15:28.108
Okay, okay.
Let me talk right now.

15:28.176 --> 15:30.878
Okay, Amanda,
Luke's an amazing guy.

15:30.946 --> 15:32.045
Why would I believe
what you're saying now

15:32.113 --> 15:33.897
and not what
you said before?

15:33.965 --> 15:35.115
I don't know.
I don't know.

15:35.250 --> 15:36.650
You know, maybe we were
just being snarky

15:36.718 --> 15:38.835
because we were jealous
of you guys.
Yeah.

15:38.903 --> 15:40.637
I mean, seeing Luke
all dressed up,

15:40.705 --> 15:42.389
getting ready
for a first date, the --

15:42.457 --> 15:45.209
the excitement of being
young and in love.

15:45.276 --> 15:46.893
Mm.
Easy.

15:46.961 --> 15:49.045
I-I remember when
I first met Cam --

15:49.097 --> 15:50.297
I'm Cam.
This is Cam.

15:50.365 --> 15:52.049
I knew I had met
the person

15:52.117 --> 15:54.468
I was gonna spend
the rest of my life with.

15:54.535 --> 15:57.070
That's what I want, too --
a relationship,

15:57.138 --> 15:58.756
someone who's gonna
be there for me.

15:58.824 --> 15:59.907
Luke feels
the same way.

15:59.974 --> 16:02.943
I mean, this is a guy
who is ready for commitment.

16:03.010 --> 16:04.411
We've really
only texted.

16:04.479 --> 16:05.612
Okay, well,
when I say --

16:05.680 --> 16:06.947
when I say
to give Luke a chance,

16:07.032 --> 16:09.599
it's because I-I know
what's at stake for you.

16:09.667 --> 16:11.868
I-I mean, you think
it's amazing now?

16:11.936 --> 16:15.322
You can't even imagine
what it could grow into.

16:15.389 --> 16:17.391
If you guys have
even the smallest chance

16:17.458 --> 16:20.711
of having what we have...
you have to go for it.

16:20.779 --> 16:21.995
Oh, my God, Mitchell.

16:22.063 --> 16:24.331
That is the Valentine's Day
card I've always wanted.

16:24.399 --> 16:25.883
Aww.

16:25.951 --> 16:27.618
That was sweet.

16:27.686 --> 16:28.919
But Luke's gone.

16:29.021 --> 16:30.638
Drive until
you hear a party.

16:30.705 --> 16:32.272
Okay. Well, you know what?
Good luck, honey.

16:32.391 --> 16:33.473
Bye, then.
Yeah, take care.

16:33.558 --> 16:34.725
Okay.

16:34.792 --> 16:36.960
You see? We have
the same address

16:37.028 --> 16:38.829
and the same last name.

16:38.897 --> 16:40.680
I was just pretending
to be a prostitute

16:40.765 --> 16:43.851
because my husband has a thing
for Jane Fonda in "Klute."

16:43.918 --> 16:44.952
The body was crazy,

16:45.020 --> 16:47.037
unfortunately,
so were the politics.

16:47.105 --> 16:49.005
Well, I guess you didn't do
anything wrong by hotel rules,

16:49.073 --> 16:51.942
but based on my personal
belief system --

16:52.010 --> 16:53.860
We're not looking for
any input. Thank you.

16:53.928 --> 16:55.979
I can't believe I took
romantic advice from Phil,

16:56.047 --> 16:59.550
a grown man I've seen in
lederhosen
at least three times.

17:00.785 --> 17:03.587
Phil told you to do
the role play?

17:03.654 --> 17:05.339
Yeah, he said you were mad
this morning

17:05.406 --> 17:07.624
because I always drop the ball
on days like this.

17:07.692 --> 17:09.159
I wasn't mad at you.

17:09.227 --> 17:12.444
I was mad at Joe
because he didn't make me
a Valentine.

17:12.512 --> 17:14.714
So, your 6-year-old kid
doesn't give you a card,

17:14.782 --> 17:16.901
you get so mad,
you throw a tire iron
through the windshield.

17:16.968 --> 17:18.602
It's got to be deeper
than that.

17:18.669 --> 17:20.020
Manny,
for the first time ever,

17:20.088 --> 17:21.872
didn't make me
a Valentine's, either.

17:21.940 --> 17:23.089
That's not deeper.

17:23.223 --> 17:26.926
That's just doubling down
on the same disturbing thing.

17:26.994 --> 17:27.777
Disturbing?

17:27.896 --> 17:29.246
When Manny was
5 years old,

17:29.314 --> 17:31.915
he told me that he would
forever be my Valentine's.

17:31.983 --> 17:35.402
Promises were made.
I will not be ignored!

17:37.222 --> 17:38.822
Okay, yeah.
That sounded weird.

17:38.890 --> 17:41.058
But the point is
that I know

17:41.125 --> 17:43.193
that you're not good
at romantic things,

17:43.261 --> 17:44.361
and I'm fine with it.

17:44.679 --> 17:47.014
Don't let me off the hook.
If I did more,

17:47.081 --> 17:49.516
you won't depend on your kids
for those things.

17:49.584 --> 17:51.001
And if I learned anything

17:51.069 --> 17:52.553
from trying to pick you up
tonight,

17:52.620 --> 17:54.104
it's how lucky
I was to get you
in the first place.

17:54.172 --> 17:55.606
I've got to do better.

17:56.174 --> 17:58.075
And I didn't think anyone

17:58.143 --> 18:01.545
could get any sexier
than Raoul Matadore.

18:04.682 --> 18:07.117
I want to remember
the exact moment

18:07.185 --> 18:09.620
I fell in love with you
all over again.

18:12.374 --> 18:13.957
What the hell
have you done?

18:14.025 --> 18:16.493
That was
my father's watch!

18:18.446 --> 18:20.030
Poor little Joe.

18:20.098 --> 18:22.283
You don't think I led him on,
do you?

18:22.350 --> 18:23.967
No, no.

18:24.035 --> 18:25.168
I am not doing this.

18:25.236 --> 18:26.987
Women always blame
themselves.

18:27.055 --> 18:29.290
Well, I'm sorry, Joe.
I don't owe you anything.

18:29.357 --> 18:32.509
You know what?
I-I think I'll handle this.

18:34.629 --> 18:35.912
Hey, buddy.

18:35.980 --> 18:38.181
Are you gonna yell
at me, too?

18:38.249 --> 18:39.449
Listen.

18:39.517 --> 18:41.184
The reason Claire
was yelling at you

18:41.252 --> 18:43.553
was to protect
my feelings.

18:43.621 --> 18:45.990
She knows I can't
compete with you,

18:46.057 --> 18:47.591
which is, um...

18:47.659 --> 18:50.477
which is why I have to ask you
a really big favor.

18:50.545 --> 18:52.713
Can you pick
another girl?

18:52.781 --> 18:54.598
I mean, you can have
anyone you want,

18:54.666 --> 18:57.001
but...
Claire's all I've got.

18:57.068 --> 18:58.969
I'd be lost without her.

18:59.037 --> 19:00.571
I don't even know how
I got her
in the first place.

19:00.638 --> 19:02.005
You <i> are</i> pretty silly.

19:02.073 --> 19:05.709
What do you say?
Dude to dude,
will you back off?

19:08.079 --> 19:09.846
Okay.

19:11.015 --> 19:12.316
Is Haley seeing anyone?

19:12.383 --> 19:13.350
Easy.

19:25.363 --> 19:27.981
How'd I get back to Arvin?
I don't know.

19:28.049 --> 19:29.466
I was just looking
for the parking lot

19:29.517 --> 19:31.368
when I came to a fork
in the path.

19:31.436 --> 19:32.736
Had I taken the other path,

19:32.803 --> 19:36.456
I would've just gotten
in my car
and gone home.

19:36.524 --> 19:38.058
Instead...

19:39.611 --> 19:41.661
You came back!

19:41.729 --> 19:43.631
Damn it, I did!

19:43.698 --> 19:46.116
Why did you run off?
What did I do?

19:46.251 --> 19:48.468
Everything.
And I've done nothing.

19:48.553 --> 19:50.437
I-I feel like a loser.

19:50.505 --> 19:51.805
<i>You</i> feel like a loser?

19:51.873 --> 19:55.476
Why do you think I went on
about myself so appallingly?

19:55.543 --> 19:56.977
Ooh, look at me.

19:57.045 --> 19:58.529
I won
the Von Snootington Award

19:58.596 --> 20:00.864
for Applied
Astro-Doofinomics.

20:00.932 --> 20:03.583
You won another award?
How is this helping?

20:03.651 --> 20:06.219
Haley...I like you.

20:07.004 --> 20:10.056
You are formidable
in a way that's...

20:11.275 --> 20:14.527
that's different
and exciting to me.

20:14.613 --> 20:16.396
Yeah, well, same,

20:16.463 --> 20:18.348
but it just doesn't
make sense.

20:18.416 --> 20:20.284
I love things that
don't make sense.

20:20.352 --> 20:22.168
That's my gig.

20:22.170 --> 20:24.188
Let's figure this out
together.

20:24.255 --> 20:25.572
Come on.

20:25.640 --> 20:27.057
What can I do?

20:33.447 --> 20:35.582
That helps.

20:40.706 --> 20:43.674
Oh, it's so weird to
think that if I had
taken another path,

20:43.742 --> 20:45.743
I could be heading home
right now.

20:45.810 --> 20:48.028
Wait a minute.
It's like what
you said before.

20:48.096 --> 20:51.564
In a different universe,
you could be
with someone else.

21:02.193 --> 21:05.045
Um, uh, could we --
could we change this song?

21:05.113 --> 21:06.513
The poppy cadence
is throwing off

21:06.580 --> 21:09.383
my more bluesy
lovemaking style.

21:09.450 --> 21:10.467
Oh!

21:10.535 --> 21:12.268
Aw, geez!
<i>Dios mio!</i>

21:12.336 --> 21:13.953
Don't you ever knock?!
This is my bedroom!

21:14.089 --> 21:16.540
I can't believe this is
happening again!

21:16.608 --> 21:17.891
Again?
Oh.

21:17.959 --> 21:19.142
I wish I had
gotten arrested!

21:19.210 --> 21:21.762
Mom, where are you?
I made you a Valen--

21:23.547 --> 21:26.383
Okay, what kind of freak show
goes on here
when I'm not around?

21:29.854 --> 21:32.789
