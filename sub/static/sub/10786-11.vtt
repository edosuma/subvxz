WEBVTT

00:01.708 --> 00:05.375
CORRECT ME IF I'M WRONG,
DAWSON, BUT DON'T YOU
ALREADY OWN A CAMERA?

00:05.375 --> 00:06.959
A VIDEO CAMERA, YEAH.

00:06.959 --> 00:08.208
AND THE DIFFERENCE IS?

00:08.208 --> 00:09.000
WELL, IMAGINE
SCHINDLER'S LIST

00:09.000 --> 00:12.000
SHOT ON
A FAMILY CAMCORDER.

00:12.000 --> 00:14.208
RIGHT?
I MEAN, VIDEO'S A GREAT
FORMAT TO LEARN ON,

00:14.208 --> 00:15.708
BUT THE LOOK
AND THE FEEL IS
STRICTLY AMATEUR.

00:15.708 --> 00:19.708
FILM IS KEY, AND I THINK
I'M FINALLY READY TO
GIVE HER ANOTHER SPIN.

00:19.708 --> 00:21.333
HER?

00:21.333 --> 00:24.667
THE ARRIFLEX.
CAPESIDE HIGH'S ONE
AND ONLY 16MM CAMERA.

00:24.667 --> 00:26.166
SHE IS A BEAUTY,
DAWSON.

00:26.166 --> 00:28.083
NIKKI, HEY, WHAT
ARE YOU DOING HERE?

00:28.083 --> 00:30.250
EXTRA CREDIT FOR
JORDAN'S FILM CLASS.

00:30.250 --> 00:32.500
PLUS, I GET
TO BE NEAR ALL
THE EQUIPMENT.

00:32.500 --> 00:35.417
AH, HOW VERY
EARNEST OF YOU.

00:35.417 --> 00:37.000
YOU'RE JOEY, RIGHT?

00:37.000 --> 00:39.333
RIGHT. HEY.

00:39.333 --> 00:41.708
I'VE HEARD WONDERFUL
THINGS ABOUT YOUR FILM.

00:41.708 --> 00:43.750
REALLY? FROM WHO?

00:43.750 --> 00:46.041
UM...SPEAKING
OF EQUIPMENT...

00:46.041 --> 00:46.959
HAND HER OVER.

00:46.959 --> 00:48.959
SORRY, DAWSON,
SHE'S CHECKED OUT.

00:48.959 --> 00:49.792
UH, THAT'S
HIGHLY UNLIKELY.

00:49.792 --> 00:52.166
YET COMPLETELY TRUE.

00:52.166 --> 00:54.542
HOW LONG HAS IT
BEEN CHECKED OUT FOR?

00:54.542 --> 00:55.708
ABOUT 7 DAYS.

00:55.708 --> 00:57.208
IT'S DUE BACK TODAY.

00:57.208 --> 01:00.333
NOPE, SHE'S CHECKED
OUT FOR THE NEXT
4 WEEKS STRAIGHT.

01:00.333 --> 01:01.667
THERE'S
A ONE WEEK MAXIMUM.

01:01.667 --> 01:03.333
I CLEARED IT
WITH MR. JORDAN.

01:03.333 --> 01:05.041
YOU DID?
MM-HMM.

01:05.041 --> 01:06.166
YOU CHECKED OUT
THE CAMERA?

01:06.166 --> 01:07.542
ME CHECK OUT
THE CAMERA, YES.

01:07.542 --> 01:09.750
WELL, THERE'S
A PROJECT THAT I WANT
TO START WORKING ON.

01:09.750 --> 01:12.083
THERE'S
A PROJECT THAT
I AM  WORKING ON.

01:12.083 --> 01:13.417
[SIGHS]

01:13.417 --> 01:15.750
OK, WELL, THEN WHEN
CAN I HAVE THE CAMERA
BACK, EXACTLY?

01:15.750 --> 01:17.875
WHEN I'M DONE.

01:17.875 --> 01:19.792
AND WHEN
WILL THAT BE?

01:19.792 --> 01:21.542
FILMMAKING IS NOT
FAST FOOD, DAWSON.

01:21.542 --> 01:23.125
YOU CAN'T RUSH IT.

02:23.625 --> 02:25.041
Jen:
WAIT A MINUTE!

02:25.041 --> 02:28.166
3 BOXES OF CEREAL, JACK?
YOU'RE GONNA NEED
AN EXPLANATION.

02:28.166 --> 02:29.542
OK, FINE.

02:29.542 --> 02:30.625
FIRST, WE HAVE
OUR GRAPE NUTS.

02:30.625 --> 02:32.250
COMBINATION OF TASTE
AND SUFFICIENT NUTRIENTS

02:32.250 --> 02:35.333
TO MAKE IT
THE PERFECT DAY-STARTER.

02:35.333 --> 02:37.291
FROM THERE WE
MOVE ON TO THE PREMIER
AFTERNOON SNACK,

02:37.291 --> 02:40.875
THE UNDERRATED
BUT EVER-TASTY
COCOA PEBBLES.

02:40.875 --> 02:42.125
[SIGHS]

02:42.125 --> 02:44.375
AND THEN WE ROUND OUT
THE CEREAL LOVER'S
PERFECT DAY

02:44.375 --> 02:49.083
WITH THAT YUMMY
LATE-NIGHT STAPLE,
CAP'N CRUNCH.

02:50.667 --> 02:51.792
IF THERE WAS
EVER A CONCERN

02:51.792 --> 02:53.500
THAT YOU WERE NOT
ANDIE McPHEE'S BROTHER,

02:53.500 --> 02:54.500
IT'S BEEN SOLVED.

02:54.500 --> 02:56.750
YEAH. WHOA,
WHAT ARE YOU--
COME ON!

02:58.291 --> 02:59.667
YOU'RE A GOOD MAN,
JACKIE BROWN,

02:59.667 --> 03:01.458
BUT AS A GROCERY
SHOPPER, YOU BLOW.

03:01.458 --> 03:06.750
I'M AFRAID I MUST
LEAVE YOU WITH THE GRAPE NUTS.

03:06.750 --> 03:07.917
FASCIST.

03:07.917 --> 03:09.208
PIG.

03:09.208 --> 03:11.834
AT LEAST YOU
FOUGHT THE GOOD FIGHT.

03:11.834 --> 03:13.125
HEY, JACK.

03:13.125 --> 03:14.000
UH, ETHAN...

03:14.000 --> 03:17.917
FROM THE TRAIN ETHAN.

03:17.917 --> 03:19.792
I PREFER
JUST PLAIN ETHAN.

03:21.000 --> 03:24.208
UH, WOW, UH...
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

03:24.208 --> 03:25.500
FOOD SHOPPING.

03:25.500 --> 03:27.959
I HEAR IT'S PRETTY
STANDARD IN ONE
OF THESE PLACES.

03:27.959 --> 03:31.291
I MEANT... I THOUGHT
YOU WERE GOING BACK
TO SCHOOL LAST WEEKEND.

03:31.291 --> 03:34.041
I DID. I CAME
BACK FOR CAPEFEST.

03:34.041 --> 03:36.166
OH...WHAT IS THAT?

03:36.166 --> 03:40.875
IS IT LIKE A...
FEED THE POOR TYPE OF THING?

03:40.875 --> 03:43.625
WHICH ONE OF US
LIVES HERE
YEAR 'ROUND?

03:43.625 --> 03:44.542
IT'S A CONCERT.

03:44.542 --> 03:46.875
A FREE CONCERT
IN THE PARK.

03:46.875 --> 03:49.125
OH, OK, SO IT'S
LIKE A 'PALOOZA TYPE DEAL?

03:49.125 --> 03:52.583
MOSHING, STAGE-DIVING,
OVERPRICED BOTTLED
WATER.

03:52.583 --> 03:55.625
ANYWAY, THERE'S
A CAMPSITE OUTSIDE
THE CONCERT,

03:55.625 --> 03:57.000
WHERE EVERYONE
HANGS OUT.

03:57.000 --> 03:58.458
I'M GOING DOWN
TO GET A SPOT TOMORROW.

03:58.458 --> 04:00.583
OH, COOL. THAT
SOUNDS LIKE A BLAST.

04:00.583 --> 04:02.375
WELL, IF YOU'RE
A FAN, YOU SHOULD COME.

04:02.375 --> 04:06.125
UH...YEAH,
I'M LIKE A TOTAL FAN.

04:06.125 --> 04:08.875
TELLTALE FAN QUIZ:
WHO'S YOUR FAVORITE
FOO FIGHTER?

04:10.375 --> 04:11.917
COURTNEY LOVE.

04:15.000 --> 04:17.166
YOU'RE IN
THE ALTERNATIVE NATION,

04:17.166 --> 04:19.750
JUST NOT QUITE
IN THE RIGHT ZIP CODE.

04:23.000 --> 04:24.458
YOU SHOULD COME ANYWAY.

04:30.834 --> 04:32.834
CUTE!

04:34.792 --> 04:37.083
GAY.

04:37.083 --> 04:39.166
AREN'T THEY ALL?

04:39.166 --> 04:41.041
Andie: EXCUSE ME,
MR. BRODERICK.

04:41.041 --> 04:42.417
CAN I SPEAK WITH YOU
FOR A MINUTE?

04:42.417 --> 04:43.417
AND YOU ARE?

04:43.417 --> 04:44.375
ANDIE McPHEE.

04:44.375 --> 04:47.625
AND YOU WANT TO
WASTE MY TIME ABOUT?

04:47.625 --> 04:48.917
THE SCHOOL PLAY.

04:48.917 --> 04:50.792
WELL, I SEE. AUDITIONS
ARE AFTER SCHOOL,

04:50.792 --> 04:51.917
SO IF YOU DON'T MIND--

04:51.917 --> 04:53.750
NO, BUT IF
YOU COULD JUST
GIVE ME A MINUTE.

04:53.750 --> 04:56.667
I AM NOT AUDITIONING
AT THIS TIME, COMPRENDE?

04:56.667 --> 04:57.834
I AM EATING LUNCH.

04:57.834 --> 05:00.625
I ASSUME YOU EAT LUNCH
ON YOUR PLANET, DO YOU NOT?

05:00.625 --> 05:02.417
BUT I'M NOT HERE
TO AUDITION.

05:02.417 --> 05:05.333
I KNOW. YOU WANT
TO STAR IN THE SHOW.

05:05.333 --> 05:06.917
ASSISTANT DIRECTOR?

05:06.917 --> 05:09.125
I'M VERY FAMILIAR
WITH THE SCENARIO.

05:09.125 --> 05:10.458
LOOK, MR. BRODERICK!

05:10.458 --> 05:13.417
I WANT TO BE
ASSISTANT DIRECTOR.

05:13.417 --> 05:18.417
I'M SMART, BOSSY,
AND SUPER-EFFICIENT,

05:18.417 --> 05:20.125
AND THE TRUTH IS,
YOU NEED ME.

05:20.125 --> 05:22.708
WHY DIDN'T YOU
JUST SAY SO?

05:25.125 --> 05:26.458
Dawson:
FILMMAKING IS NOT
FAST FOOD, DAWSON.

05:26.458 --> 05:29.458
SHE'S ENTITLED TO
THE EQUIPMENT, TOO.

05:29.458 --> 05:31.125
LOOK, YOU CHECK OUT
A CAMERA,

05:31.125 --> 05:34.125
YOU RETURN THE CAMERA
IN A TIMELY FASHION.
THAT'S ALL I'M ASKING.

05:36.250 --> 05:36.917
UH, MOM?

05:36.917 --> 05:38.875
OH.

05:38.875 --> 05:39.208
WHAT'S GOING ON?

05:39.208 --> 05:40.125
HEY.

05:40.125 --> 05:44.667
UH, LOOK, HONEY,

05:44.667 --> 05:48.125
I'M GONNA BE
TAKING SOME FURNITURE
OVER TO MY PLACE.

05:48.125 --> 05:49.125
OH, OK.

05:49.125 --> 05:51.667
JUST THE FAMILY ROOM
AND THE GUEST ROOM.

05:51.667 --> 05:54.166
IT'S PART OF
THE SETTLEMENT.

05:54.166 --> 05:55.375
I ASKED YOUR DAD
NOT TO SAY ANYTHING

05:55.375 --> 05:57.625
BECAUSE I WANTED
TO EXPLAIN MYSELF.

05:57.625 --> 06:00.625
MOM, YOU DON'T HAVE
TO EXPLAIN YOURSELF.
THAT'S HOW IT WORKS.

06:00.625 --> 06:03.667
I NEED YOU TO KEEP
BEING AS POSITIVE

06:03.667 --> 06:04.834
AS YOU CAN BE
ABOUT THIS, HONEY.

06:04.834 --> 06:08.000
IT'S GONNA MAKE IT SO MUCH
EASIER ON ALL OF US.

06:08.000 --> 06:10.834
WELL, I AIM TO PLEASE.

06:10.834 --> 06:14.208
THANK YOU
FOR UNDERSTANDING.

06:27.166 --> 06:29.250
WANNA TALK?

06:29.250 --> 06:33.208
WHAT'S THERE TO SAY?

06:33.208 --> 06:37.708
ABOUT WHAT
YOU'RE FEELING?

06:37.708 --> 06:38.542
I'M THINKING
MY PARENTS ARE DIVORCED,

06:38.542 --> 06:41.875
AND I'M GLAD
IT'S FINALLY OVER.

06:41.875 --> 06:43.542
DAWSON, I SAID
WHAT YOU'RE FEELING.

06:46.041 --> 06:48.083
I'M STILL WORKING
ON THAT ONE.

06:52.000 --> 06:54.333
THIS IS GONNA BE GREAT.
I MEAN, SLEEPING OUT
UNDER THE STARS,

06:54.333 --> 06:56.708
FRESH BREEZE
OFF OF THAT OCEAN.

06:56.708 --> 06:58.250
THE CALL OF THE WILD.

06:58.250 --> 07:00.125
WELL, IT'S
THE CALL OF NATURE
I'M WORRIED ABOUT.

07:00.125 --> 07:01.291
JACK, WHERE
ARE THE CHEMICAL
TOILETS?

07:01.291 --> 07:05.792
I DON'T KNOW.
WHAT DO YOU SAY
WE SET UP HERE?

07:05.792 --> 07:07.542
HA. I THOUGHT I'D GO
TO EXTREME MEASURES

07:07.542 --> 07:08.875
TO GET IN
SOME GUY'S PANTS.

07:08.875 --> 07:11.208
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.
I'M NOT TRYING TO GET
IN HIS PANTS.

07:11.208 --> 07:12.917
FOR CRYING OUT LOUD,
THIS IS THE FIRST GAY GUY

07:12.917 --> 07:14.208
I'VE ACTUALLY
CONVERSED WITH.

07:14.208 --> 07:15.750
EXCUSE ME FOR WANTING
TO GET TO KNOW HIM.

07:15.750 --> 07:17.166
JACK, I KNOW.

07:17.166 --> 07:20.750
JUST BE AWARE
THAT YOU'RE VENTURING
INTO NEW TERRITORY HERE.

07:20.750 --> 07:23.375
AND THAT BEFORE YOU TAKE
THIS GREAT BIG
EMOTIONAL LEAP, JACK,

07:23.375 --> 07:25.417
YOU SHOULD BE
WILLING TO ADMIT THAT
YOU'RE TAKING IT.

07:25.417 --> 07:26.834
DON'T JUST TRY
AND BRUSH IT OFF

07:26.834 --> 07:28.458
AS SIMPLY
WANTING TO GET
TO KNOW SOMEBODY.

07:28.458 --> 07:31.458
I'M TELLING YOU,
THAT'S ALL IT IS.

07:31.458 --> 07:35.875
OK. EVEN STILL,
TAKE MY ADVICE.

07:35.875 --> 07:38.417
PLAY IT COOL.
LET HIM COME
TO YOU.

07:38.417 --> 07:40.667
I THINK I'M GONNA SEE
IF I CAN FIND HIM.

07:49.000 --> 07:51.166
OK, CORIE.
MAYBE YOU'RE RIGHT.

07:51.166 --> 07:53.333
MAYBE LOVE ISN'T ENOUGH.

07:53.333 --> 07:55.333
MAYBE 2 PEOPLE
SHOULD HAVE TO TAKE MORE
THAN A BLOOD TEST.

07:55.333 --> 07:58.792
MAYBE LOVE ISN'T ENOUGH.

07:58.792 --> 08:01.917
OK, CORIE.
MAYBE YOU'RE RIGHT.

08:01.917 --> 08:03.834
MAYBE LOVE
ISN'T ENOUGH.

08:03.834 --> 08:06.291
MAYBE 2 PEOPLE
SHOULD HAVE TO TAKE
MORE THAN A BLOOD TEST.

08:06.291 --> 08:07.333
MAYBE THEY SHOULD BE
CHECKED...

08:07.333 --> 08:09.083
MAYBE THEY
SHOULD BE CHECKED...

08:09.083 --> 08:11.792
FOR COMMON SENSE,
UNDERSTANDING...

08:11.792 --> 08:13.625
MAYBE THEY
SHOULD BE CHECKED
FOR COMMON SENSE,

08:13.625 --> 08:16.792
UNDERSTANDING,
AND EMOTIONAL
MATURITY.

08:20.542 --> 08:24.333
OK, CORIE.
MAYBE YOU'RE RIGHT.

08:24.333 --> 08:27.750
MAYBE LOVE ISN'T ENOUGH.

08:27.750 --> 08:32.082
MAYBE 2 PEOPLE
SHOULD HAVE TO TAKE
MORE THAN A BLOOD TEST.

08:32.082 --> 08:36.166
MAYBE THEY SHOULD
BE CHECKED FOR COMMON SENSE,

08:36.166 --> 08:39.250
UNDERSTANDING,
AND EMOTIONAL MATURITY.

08:41.082 --> 08:43.500
I LIKE HIM.
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

08:43.500 --> 08:45.959
I THINK I'M GETTING
A MIGRAINE.

08:45.959 --> 08:49.542
I THINK HE'S GOT
A CERTAIN
DRAMATIC FLAIR.

08:49.542 --> 08:50.834
I'VE GOT SOMEONE ELSE
IN MIND.

08:50.834 --> 08:55.625
WHO, SOMEONE ELSE?
WE ARE OUT
OF SOMEONE ELSES.

08:55.625 --> 08:58.792
GRANTED, THE BOY I KNOW
IS A DEPLORABLE STUDENT,

08:58.792 --> 09:01.542
AND HE HAS THE ETHICS
OF A BILLY GOAT.

09:01.542 --> 09:04.667
WE HAVE ALREADY
CAST OUR CORIE
AND VELASCO.

09:04.667 --> 09:07.583
PLEASE DON'T LET
OUR ONLY PAUL
SLIP AWAY.

09:07.583 --> 09:10.208
HAVE NO FEAR,
MS. McPHEE.

09:10.208 --> 09:11.625
I CUT A DEAL
WITH ONE OF MY STUDENTS.

09:11.625 --> 09:16.542
THE KID IS A NATURAL
WITH COMEDY.

09:16.542 --> 09:22.750
OK, MR. BRODERICK,
IF I MAY BE SO BOLD,

09:22.750 --> 09:23.583
FROM MY LIMITED
PERSPECTIVE,

09:23.583 --> 09:26.625
I SEE BUT 2 KINDS
OF ACTORS--

09:26.625 --> 09:28.834
THOSE WITH TALENT

09:28.834 --> 09:30.375
AND THOSE WITH
THE ABILITY TO EXPAND
ON THAT TALENT,

09:30.375 --> 09:32.875
WHICH REQUIRES
MATURITY,

09:32.875 --> 09:35.834
WHICH REQUIRES A SENSE
OF RESPONSIBILITY,

09:35.834 --> 09:37.583
WHICH REQUIRES
THE ABILITY TO COME

09:37.583 --> 09:39.583
BOTH PREPARED
AND ON TIME.

09:39.583 --> 09:42.041
HEY, YOU GUYS.
I'M SORRY I'M LATE.

09:42.041 --> 09:44.875
I'M HERE TO READ
FOR THE ROLE OF PAUL.
PACEY WITTER.

09:44.875 --> 09:48.125
THAT'S HIM.
THAT'S OUR PAUL.

09:48.125 --> 09:50.333
UM...

09:54.166 --> 09:55.417
UM...

10:06.708 --> 10:09.917
DAWSON, TELL ME
THIS ISN'T AN ATTEMPT

10:09.917 --> 10:13.208
TO REPOSSESS
THE CAMERA.

10:13.208 --> 10:15.917
I JUST WANT TO
REITERATE SOMETHING.

10:15.917 --> 10:18.667
REITERATE AWAY.

10:18.667 --> 10:20.542
OK, I GET THIS
LITTLE EGO TRIP.

10:20.542 --> 10:22.500
ALL RIGHT, I KNOW
YOU'RE THE PRINCIPAL'S
DAUGHTER,

10:22.500 --> 10:23.834
BUT THAT DOES NOT
GIVE YOU THE RIGHT TO BE
SELFISH OR RUDE.

10:23.834 --> 10:27.959
DAWSON, I DIDN'T KNOW
YOU WANTED TO USE THE CAMERA,

10:27.959 --> 10:32.458
BUT YOU'RE JUST GONNA
HAVE TO GET USED TO IT.

10:32.458 --> 10:34.208
I THOUGHT I HEARD
A FAMILIAR
SOUNDING VOICE.

10:34.208 --> 10:37.792
IF IT ISN'T
MY SECOND FAVORITE
STUDENT FILMMAKER.

10:37.792 --> 10:39.000
HOW ARE YOU, DAWSON?

10:39.000 --> 10:40.291
PRINCIPAL GREEN.
GOOD.

10:40.291 --> 10:41.792
SO I UNDERSTAND
THAT YOU AND NIKKI

10:41.792 --> 10:43.291
HAVE BECOME
FAST FRIENDS.

10:43.291 --> 10:45.458
YEAH. YEAH.

10:45.458 --> 10:46.333
I HAD A FEELING
YOU TWO WOULD
HIT IT OFF.

10:46.333 --> 10:48.625
HA. HEY, LISTEN,

10:48.625 --> 10:49.291
WHY DON'T YOU
STAY AND JOIN US
FOR SUPPER?

10:49.291 --> 10:51.375
I COULDN'T, I'VE GOT--

10:51.375 --> 10:53.125
OH, DADDY, I'M SURE
DAWSON HAS OTHER PLANS.

10:53.125 --> 10:55.417
NOW, WAIT A MINUTE.
AS YOUR FATHER AND
AS YOUR PRINCIPAL,

10:55.417 --> 10:56.750
I THINK I'M GONNA
HAVE TO PULL
RANK HERE.

10:56.750 --> 10:59.291
BESIDES, HOW OFTEN
DO I GET A CHANCE

10:59.291 --> 11:00.708
TO HAVE A NICE MEAL
WITH ONE
OF MY STUDENTS?

11:00.708 --> 11:02.959
AND I PROMISE
NOT TO TALK TOO MUCH

11:02.959 --> 11:05.542
ABOUT MY LOVELY
LITTLE DAUGHTER.

11:05.542 --> 11:07.750
HA HA HA. COME ON.

11:18.291 --> 11:20.875
HEY, THERE.

11:20.875 --> 11:23.250
SO YOU DECIDED TO SHOW.

11:23.250 --> 11:26.458
WELL, ONE SMALL
STEP FOR MAN,

11:26.458 --> 11:27.625
ONE GIANT LEAP
FOR MANKIND.

11:27.625 --> 11:30.917
YOU HERE BY YOURSELF,
OR WITH?

11:30.917 --> 11:34.959
UH, WITH. A GIRL.
SHE'S A FRIEND
OF MINE.

11:34.959 --> 11:37.041
SETTING UP OUR TENT.

11:37.041 --> 11:38.333
AHEM.
WHAT ABOUT YOU?

11:38.333 --> 11:41.708
ALL BY MY LONESOME.

11:44.375 --> 11:45.875
UM, UM--

11:45.875 --> 11:48.333
SO, YOU WANT TO GO
GRAB A BITE TO EAT,

11:48.333 --> 11:49.333
TAKE A WALK, WHAT?

11:49.333 --> 11:53.291
YEAH. UH, TO BOTH.

11:53.291 --> 11:54.792
WHATEVER.

11:57.375 --> 11:58.959
COME ON.
I'LL LEAD THE WAY.

12:04.333 --> 12:05.542
AFTER THE TRAIN RIDE,
I THOUGHT FOR SURE

12:05.542 --> 12:08.375
YOU'D ASK FOR MY NUMBER.

12:08.375 --> 12:10.625
YEAH, WELL,
TYPICAL PARANOIA SET IN.

12:10.625 --> 12:12.375
WHAT CAN I SAY?

12:12.375 --> 12:16.000
I FIGURED AS MUCH.

12:16.000 --> 12:18.542
HOW COME YOU DIDN'T
ASK FOR MINE?

12:18.542 --> 12:20.834
BECAUSE I COULD.

12:20.834 --> 12:23.208
IT'S MORE IMPORTANT
THAT YOU LEARN TO ASK.

12:23.208 --> 12:24.542
YOU'RE THE NEWBIE,
REMEMBER?

12:24.542 --> 12:27.625
YEAH, NEWBIE. UH,
THE BARELY OUT GAY KID

12:27.625 --> 12:29.041
SOON TO HAVE
HIS HEART BROKEN, RIGHT?

12:29.041 --> 12:30.667
GOOD RECALL.

12:30.667 --> 12:32.583
YEAH, WELL, THERE'S
NOT MUCH I'M GONNA FORGET
ABOUT THAT CONVERSATION.

12:32.583 --> 12:34.625
THAT WAS A FIRST FOR ME.

12:34.625 --> 12:35.792
THAT WAS
YOUR FIRST TIME

12:35.792 --> 12:38.000
TALKING
TO ANOTHER GAY KID?

12:38.000 --> 12:43.417
YEAH, WELL, UNLESS
YOU COUNT THE INTERNET.

12:43.417 --> 12:45.750
I--I DON'T.

12:59.000 --> 13:00.542
HEY, MAN.
WHERE'D YOU GET THAT?

13:00.542 --> 13:01.708
OH. OVER THERE.

13:01.708 --> 13:04.041
THIS GUY'S LIKE
A GENIUS WITH
A VEGGIE BURGER.

13:04.041 --> 13:05.834
VEGGIE BURGERS!
GET 'EM
WHILE THEY'RE HOT!

13:05.834 --> 13:09.667
HEY, NO CROWDING.
PLENTY FOR EVERYONE.

13:09.667 --> 13:12.125
ALL MEATLESS.
NO COWS DIED TO MAKE THESE.

13:12.125 --> 13:14.125
YOU WANT YOUR BUN TOASTED?

13:14.125 --> 13:16.708
THOUGHT YOU'D NEVER ASK.

13:17.708 --> 13:18.959
HEY.

13:18.959 --> 13:19.750
HEY.

13:19.750 --> 13:21.708
QUITE A CROWD
YOU HAVE HERE.

13:21.708 --> 13:24.083
LISTEN, I REALLY
DON'T HAVE TIME

13:24.083 --> 13:25.625
FOR SMALL TALK
AT THE MOMENT.

13:25.625 --> 13:28.458
DID--DID YOU WANT
A BURGER, OR NOT?

13:28.458 --> 13:29.708
YES.

13:30.917 --> 13:34.125
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I WAS WONDERING
IF MAYBE YOU COULD

13:34.125 --> 13:35.750
GIVE ME A HAND
WITH MY TENT.

13:35.750 --> 13:37.959
I WAS NEVER MUCH
OF A GIRL SCOUT.

13:39.959 --> 13:43.708
STANLEY. TAKE OVER HERE
FOR A MINUTE, WILL YOU?

13:45.166 --> 13:48.041
SO YOU NEVER TOLD ME
THAT YOU WERE A VEGETARIAN.

13:48.041 --> 13:49.542
YOU NEVER ASKED.

13:51.834 --> 13:53.583
DO I DETECT A NOTE OF
AMBIVALENCE IN SEEING ME?

13:53.583 --> 13:57.500
THAT WOULD
BE CORRECT.

13:57.500 --> 13:59.500
ANY PARTICULAR REASON?

13:59.500 --> 14:01.000
YOU--YOU MEAN
BESIDES THE FACT

14:01.000 --> 14:02.667
THAT YOU LEAD ME ON
FOR THE SOLE PURPOSE

14:02.667 --> 14:05.000
OF CRUSHING ME
UNDERFOOT?

14:05.000 --> 14:07.333
THAT'S NOT TRUE, HENRY,
AND YOU KNOW IT.

14:07.333 --> 14:09.333
YEAH, WELL. YOU COULD
HAVE FOOLED ME.

14:09.333 --> 14:11.667
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

14:11.667 --> 14:13.000
DON'T TELL ME
THAT YOU'RE NOT

14:13.000 --> 14:15.417
TAKING SOME
SMALL SATISFACTION
IN IT.

14:15.417 --> 14:16.583
IN WHAT?

14:16.583 --> 14:19.959
BEING ON
THE REQUITED SIDE
OF UNREQUITED LOVE.

14:23.333 --> 14:26.667
HENRY, I THOUGHT
THAT YOU AND I
AGREED TO BE FRIENDS.

14:26.667 --> 14:29.708
FRIENDS?

14:29.708 --> 14:32.125
YOU HAVEN'T EVEN
NOTICED, HAVE YOU?

14:32.125 --> 14:34.500
WHAT? NOTICED WHAT?

14:34.500 --> 14:36.583
THAT WE HAVEN'T SPOKEN
IN OVER A MONTH.

14:36.583 --> 14:39.875
FOR THE PAST 4 WEEKS,
I'VE BEEN GIVING YOU
THE SILENT TREATMENT,

14:39.875 --> 14:42.000
AND IT HASN'T
EVEN REGISTERED
ON YOUR RADAR SCREEN.

14:42.000 --> 14:44.250
HELL, I COULD HAVE
FALLEN OFF A CLIFF

14:44.250 --> 14:46.208
10,000 FEET
FOR ALL YOU CARE.

14:46.208 --> 14:48.333
THAT'S NOT TRUE. ALL RIGHT?
LOOK, YOU KNOW WHAT?

14:48.333 --> 14:52.792
YOU CAN PUT UP
YOUR OWN DAMN TENT.

14:55.375 --> 14:59.291
DAWSON, YOU'RE LOOKING
AT PROBABLY THE ONLY
LITTLE GIRL IN AMERICA

14:59.291 --> 15:02.959
WHO WANTED
A SUPER 8 CAMERA
FOR HER 10th BIRTHDAY.

15:02.959 --> 15:05.917
[LAUGHS]
NIKKI, SHOULD I TELL HIM

15:05.917 --> 15:07.917
THE NAME OF YOUR FIRST
CINEMATIC ACHIEVEMENT?

15:07.917 --> 15:09.125
DON'T YOU DARE.

15:09.125 --> 15:12.542
A DAY IN THE LIFE
OF DADDY.  HA HA.

15:12.542 --> 15:14.125
SHE FOLLOWED ME AROUND
ALL DAY LONG.

15:14.125 --> 15:16.667
JAMES CAMERON
OF THIRD GRADE.

15:16.667 --> 15:19.625
SO TELL ME,
HAS SHE ENLISTED YOU
FOR HER NEW FILM?

15:19.625 --> 15:20.917
UH, NO, SHE HASN'T.

15:20.917 --> 15:22.291
I DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHAT IT'S ABOUT.

15:22.291 --> 15:23.834
THAT'S BETWEEN
ME AND MY CREW.

15:23.834 --> 15:27.041
SO, IN ORDER TO BASK
IN THE GLORY

15:27.041 --> 15:29.417
OF THIS MIND-BENDING
IDEA OF YOURS

15:29.417 --> 15:29.959
I HAVE TO OFFER
MY SERVICES?

15:29.959 --> 15:32.333
IS THAT AN OFFER?

15:32.333 --> 15:33.583
ARE YOU ASKING
FOR MY HELP?

15:33.583 --> 15:35.708
I DON'T NEED
ANY HELP, DAWSON.

15:35.708 --> 15:37.375
I THINK IT WOULD BE
A GREAT IDEA

15:37.375 --> 15:38.583
FOR YOU TWO
TO WORK TOGETHER.

15:38.583 --> 15:40.250
FORGET IT.
I DON'T THINK THAT--

15:40.250 --> 15:41.583
I'M SORRY
I MENTIONED IT.

15:45.917 --> 15:47.583
YEAH.

15:47.583 --> 15:50.458
YOU KNEW THAT YOUNG
THAT YOU WERE
ATTRACTED TO MEN?

15:50.458 --> 15:54.250
NO, I KNEW THAT YOUNG
THAT I WAS DIFFERENT.

15:54.250 --> 15:58.750
BEING GAY ISN'T ABOUT
WHAT SEX YOU'RE ATTRACTED TO.

15:58.750 --> 16:01.750
IT FORMS SO MUCH
OF WHO AND WHAT YOU ARE.

16:01.750 --> 16:02.875
YOU--YOU LOST ME.

16:02.875 --> 16:04.250
I'LL MAKE IT SIMPLE.

16:04.250 --> 16:06.333
YOU HAVEN'T TALKED
TO ANOTHER GAY KID,

16:06.333 --> 16:07.542
SO YOU DEFINITELY
HAVEN'T KISSED ONE, RIGHT?

16:07.542 --> 16:09.041
NO.

16:09.041 --> 16:11.250
BUT YOU STILL
KNOW YOU'RE GAY.

16:11.250 --> 16:11.959
SURE.
HOW?

16:11.959 --> 16:14.291
I--I JUST KNOW,
I GUESS.

16:16.333 --> 16:19.083
EVERYONE ALWAYS
WANTS TO DEFINE GAY
AND STRAIGHT

16:19.083 --> 16:21.750
BY WHO YOU SLEEP WITH.
IT'S NOT ABOUT THAT.

16:21.750 --> 16:26.166
IT'S ABOUT MOMENTS.

16:26.166 --> 16:29.375
IT'S ABOUT BEING
TOO NERVOUS TO ASK
FOR MY NUMBER.

16:29.375 --> 16:32.959
IT'S ABOUT
CONVERSATIONS LIKE THIS.

16:32.959 --> 16:33.959
IT'S ABOUT WHO
AND WHAT YOU LOVE.

16:33.959 --> 16:36.375
THAT'S WHY
YOU CAN'T ERASE IT.

16:36.375 --> 16:41.792
BECAUSE IT'S NOT
JUST A PART OF YOUR LIFE,
IT'S EVERYWHERE.

16:45.041 --> 16:46.792
UNLIKE MY STUFF.

16:46.792 --> 16:47.542
WHAT?

16:47.542 --> 16:50.250
MY CAMPING GEAR.
IT'S GONE.

16:50.250 --> 16:52.250
OH.
OH, MAN.

16:55.458 --> 16:56.417
AFTER YOU.

16:56.417 --> 16:58.000
I WANT YOU TO QUIT.

16:58.000 --> 17:00.875
LISTEN, HE SAW
MY POTENTIAL, OK?

17:00.875 --> 17:03.000
NO, NO, NO, NO. THIS WAS
MY AFTER-SCHOOL ACTIVITY.

17:03.000 --> 17:05.165
BUT I'M THE LEAD
IN THE PLAY.

17:05.165 --> 17:08.000
I WANT YOU TO QUIT.

17:08.000 --> 17:10.458
ALL RIGHT, LISTEN,
THE GUY SAID HE'D GIVE ME
A "C" IN ENGLISH.

17:10.458 --> 17:11.916
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

17:11.916 --> 17:14.791
OH, OH. THAT'S
WHAT IT'S COME TO?
ANYTHING FOR A "C"?

17:14.791 --> 17:16.416
WHAT'S HAPPENED
TO YOU?

17:16.416 --> 17:18.916
OK, NOT THAT THIS
IS ANY OF YOUR CONCERN,

17:18.916 --> 17:20.040
BUT MR. BRODERICK
SAYS HE THINKS

17:20.040 --> 17:22.083
I MIGHT ACTUALLY
BE GOOD AT THIS,
AND SO DO I.

17:22.083 --> 17:24.791
OK, LISTEN.
MR. BRODERICK MAY BE

17:24.791 --> 17:25.875
A LOUSY
ENGLISH TEACHER,

17:25.875 --> 17:27.708
BUT AS
A THEATER DIRECTOR,

17:27.708 --> 17:29.792
HE IS PROBING
NEW LOWS, PACEY.

17:29.792 --> 17:31.166
RUMOR HAS IT
THAT HE HAS BOTCHED

17:31.166 --> 17:33.417
EVERY SCHOOL PLAY
FOR THE PAST
5 YEARS.

17:33.417 --> 17:36.041
AND IT'S ONLY
BY SHEER FORCE
OF WILL

17:36.041 --> 17:36.875
THAT THE PAST
STUDENT THEATER
GEEKS

17:36.875 --> 17:38.959
HAVE MANAGED
TO SANDBAG

17:38.959 --> 17:41.333
HIS BI-HOURLY
NERVOUS BREAKDOWNS.

17:41.333 --> 17:43.542
SO, WHAT'S YOUR POINT?

17:43.542 --> 17:48.959
MY POINT IS,
I GOT INTO THIS
TO GET OVER YOU, OK?

17:48.959 --> 17:51.000
TO GIVE MYSELF
A NEW FOCUS,

17:51.000 --> 17:52.542
AND INSTEAD,
YOUR PRESENCE

17:52.542 --> 17:54.500
IS GIVING ME
PERPETUAL MYOPIA.

17:54.500 --> 17:56.166
WE HAVEN'T EVEN DONE
ONE REHEARSAL YET.

17:56.166 --> 17:58.542
YOU WANT ME TO THROW
MY WHOLE THEATER CAREER
TO THE WIND?

17:58.542 --> 18:01.166
OH. OK, LISTEN,
SIR BARRYMORE,

18:01.166 --> 18:02.834
OUR DIRECTOR
IS IRRATIONAL,

18:02.834 --> 18:05.000
AND YOUR
LACK OF ABILITY,

18:05.000 --> 18:06.458
THOUGH NOT APPARENT
TO HIM YET,

18:06.458 --> 18:09.375
IS ENOUGH
TO SEND HIM OVER
THE PROVERBIAL EDGE

18:09.375 --> 18:10.375
AND ME WITH HIM.

18:10.375 --> 18:11.792
FINE. YOU QUIT, THEN.

18:11.792 --> 18:13.667
I MOST CERTAINLY
WILL NOT.

18:13.667 --> 18:15.417
I'M NOT GONNA QUIT.
WITTERS ARE NOT QUITTERS.

18:15.417 --> 18:16.959
OH, OH,
THAT'S REALLY CUTE.

18:16.959 --> 18:18.792
YOU KNOW WHAT?
FINE. JUST DON'T.

18:18.792 --> 18:21.041
FINE. I WON'T.

18:37.792 --> 18:39.417
DAWSON?

18:39.417 --> 18:42.458
HEY. I MUST SAY,
YOUR FILM GEEKDOM

18:42.458 --> 18:45.625
IS DEFINITELY
NOT EVIDENT IN YOUR
BEDROOM DECOR.

18:45.625 --> 18:48.083
YOUR ROOM, LET ME GUESS.

18:48.083 --> 18:49.125
WALL-TO-WALL
SPIELBERG ONE-SHEETS?

18:49.125 --> 18:53.041
UH, YEAH.
WELL, IT'S A SHRINE.

18:53.041 --> 18:54.959
FIGURED AS MUCH.

18:56.125 --> 18:58.291
YOU SAY THAT LIKE
IT'S A BAD THING.

18:58.291 --> 19:00.667
OH, IT'S NOT.
IT'S JUST...

19:00.667 --> 19:02.792
THERE'S SO MUCH
TO BE PASSIONATE ABOUT.

19:02.792 --> 19:05.166
IT SEEMS KIND OF SILLY
TO ONLY FOCUS ON ONE.

19:05.166 --> 19:07.208
YEAH, BUT IF
YOU'RE LUCKY ENOUGH
TO FIND THAT ONE THING,

19:07.208 --> 19:08.667
WHY NOT JUST IMMERSE
YOURSELF IN IT?

19:08.667 --> 19:10.917
DON'T GET ME WRONG, DAWSON.
I LOVE FILM,

19:10.917 --> 19:13.208
BUT I LOVE IT
BECAUSE IT ALLOWS ME

19:13.208 --> 19:16.000
TO EXPLORE
ALL OF THE OTHER SUBJECTS
THAT INTEREST ME.

19:16.000 --> 19:19.250
IF ALL YOU CARE ABOUT
IS FILM,

19:19.250 --> 19:22.959
THEN YOU'RE JUST GONNA
END UP MAKING MOVIES
ABOUT OTHER MOVIES.

19:22.959 --> 19:25.000
WHAT GOOD IS THAT?

19:27.041 --> 19:29.500
I'M REALLY SORRY
ABOUT MY FATHER.

19:29.500 --> 19:30.458
UM, EVER SINCE
THE DIVORCE,

19:30.458 --> 19:33.291
HE DOES THIS REALLY
AGGRESSIVE THING

19:33.291 --> 19:36.166
WHEN IT COMES TO ME
MAKING FRIENDS.
IT'S SO WEIRD.

19:36.166 --> 19:37.667
BUT YOU KNOW,
I TRY TO CUT HIM
SOME SLACK.

19:37.667 --> 19:40.625
SO...

19:42.250 --> 19:43.750
SO YOU'RE COOL
WITH IT?

19:43.750 --> 19:45.792
THE--THE DIVORCE?

19:47.667 --> 19:51.375
THE, UM, CONSTANT SHUTTLING
BETWEEN LIVING QUARTERS,

19:51.375 --> 19:55.250
THE CONTINUALLY VEILED
AND NOT-SO-VEILED COMMENTS

19:55.250 --> 19:56.750
MY PARENTS
MAKE ABOUT EACH OTHER,

19:56.750 --> 19:59.375
THE, UM, NEVER-ENDING
EXPECTATION

19:59.375 --> 20:01.250
THAT I LOOK ON
THE BRIGHT SIDE OF THINGS?

20:01.250 --> 20:05.417
OH, SURE.
I'M JUST DANDY.

20:05.417 --> 20:06.750
THAT'S
THE ODDEST THING.

20:06.750 --> 20:09.208
I MEAN, JUDGING FROM
HOW WELL PUT-TOGETHER
YOU COME OFF,

20:09.208 --> 20:11.667
I WOULD JUST ASSUME
THAT YOU'RE NOT
AFFECTED BY IT AT ALL.

20:11.667 --> 20:14.333
IT'S A WELL-CRAFTED
DISGUISE, DAWSON.

20:14.333 --> 20:17.834
INSIDE, I'M JUST
ANOTHER ANGRY KID.

20:17.834 --> 20:21.458
HOW ANGRY?

20:25.625 --> 20:28.083
ANGRY ENOUGH TO MAKE
A FILM ABOUT IT.

20:30.208 --> 20:32.792
SO THAT'S WHAT
YOUR MOVIE'S ABOUT.

20:32.792 --> 20:38.333
MORE OR LESS.
IT'S ABOUT THE, UM,
AMERICAN FAMILY.

20:38.333 --> 20:39.917
WHAT MAKES THEM
FUNCTIONAL,

20:39.917 --> 20:43.875
OR, UH, AS MORE OFTEN
SEEMS TO BE THE CASE,
DYSFUNCTIONAL.

20:43.875 --> 20:46.708
WELL, CAPESIDE
SHOULD PROVIDE YOU

20:46.708 --> 20:48.875
WITH A HEALTHY SUPPLY
OF MATERIAL THERE.

20:50.417 --> 20:54.333
WHAT ABOUT YOU?
YOUR PARENTS ARE DIVORCED.

20:54.333 --> 20:55.667
HOW DO YOU FEEL
ABOUT IT?

20:58.417 --> 20:59.500
UM...

20:59.500 --> 21:02.458
I, UM, I DON'T MEAN
TO PROBE. I'M SORRY.

21:02.458 --> 21:07.583
NO. NO, I MEAN,
YOU--YOU WERE HONEST
WITH ME,

21:07.583 --> 21:10.542
THE LEAST I COULD DO
IS BE HONEST BACK,
RIGHT?

21:10.542 --> 21:13.417
UM...

21:13.417 --> 21:15.291
THE TRUTH IS,
MOST OF THE TIME
I'M--I'M FINE

21:15.291 --> 21:16.834
WITH THEY'RE
NOT BEING TOGETHER.

21:16.834 --> 21:20.625
YOU KNOW, I MEAN,
MAYBE I'M JUST
SELF-OBSESSED,

21:20.625 --> 21:24.500
BUT I--I JUST
DON'T THINK ABOUT IT
THAT MUCH, YOU KNOW?

21:24.500 --> 21:28.333
AND THEN,
UM, OTHER TIMES
IT JUST--

21:28.333 --> 21:31.083
IT JUST KIND OF
SNEAKS UP ON YOU.

21:31.083 --> 21:36.708
YOU KNOW, I MEAN,
IT'S...LIKE A...

21:36.708 --> 21:39.959
A DISAPPOINTMENT
OF BEING THE PRODUCT

21:39.959 --> 21:43.250
OF SOMETHING THAT
DIDN'T WORK OUT.

21:43.250 --> 21:45.458
I MEAN,
'CAUSE THAT'S WHAT
OUR PARENTS ARE.

21:45.458 --> 21:49.458
THEY'RE OUR--OUR
PRIMARY EXAMPLES
OF LOVE,

21:49.458 --> 21:55.166
AND--AND MY EXAMPLE
JUST WASN'T...

21:55.166 --> 21:58.708
I GUESS, STRONG
ENOUGH TO, UM...

21:58.708 --> 22:00.291
DAWSON?

22:00.291 --> 22:04.417
I SHOULD GET GOING.
UM, TELL YOUR DAD
THANKS.

22:18.667 --> 22:21.208
OH, JACK. THANK GOD
YOU'RE BACK

22:21.208 --> 22:22.542
FROM YOUR STALK--
I MEAN, WALK.

22:22.542 --> 22:23.500
YOU'RE NEVER
GONNA GUESS

22:23.500 --> 22:25.750
WHO I RAN INTO HERE,
OF ALL--

22:25.750 --> 22:27.625
HI.

22:27.625 --> 22:28.542
HELLO.

22:28.542 --> 22:30.333
ETHAN, JEN.
JEN, ETHAN.

22:30.333 --> 22:31.333
NICE TO MEET YOU.

22:31.333 --> 22:32.667
IT'S NICE TO MEET YOU.

22:32.667 --> 22:34.000
IT LOOKS LIKE YOU COULD
USE A LITTLE HELP
WITH THIS TENT.

22:34.000 --> 22:37.166
YES. PLEASE.

22:37.166 --> 22:40.000
RELIEVE ME OF ALL
OF MY FEMINIST
ILLUSIONS

22:40.000 --> 22:41.208
ABOUT THE EQUALITY
OF THE SEXES

22:41.208 --> 22:43.208
CONCERNING
SPATIAL RELATIONS.

22:43.208 --> 22:45.417
UH, LISTEN.

22:45.417 --> 22:47.333
ALL OF HIS STUFF
GOT STOLEN, OK?
ALL OF HIS GEAR.

22:47.333 --> 22:50.000
SO, UH, HE NEEDS
A PLACE TO STAY TONIGHT.

22:50.000 --> 22:51.333
AND YOU, BEING
THE KIND-HEARTED SOUL
THAT YOU ARE,

22:51.333 --> 22:53.500
OFFERED HIM
A SPOT IN OUR TENT.

22:53.500 --> 22:54.667
YEAH, SO COULD YOU, UH,

22:54.667 --> 22:56.208
GO TAKE A WALK
FOR A COUPLE OF HOURS?

22:56.208 --> 22:58.000
COME BACK AROUND,
SAY, MIDNIGHT?

22:58.000 --> 22:58.625
YOU'RE KIDDING ME.

22:58.625 --> 23:00.792
NOPE. GO MIX. MINGLE.

23:00.792 --> 23:02.542
WRITE A FEW LETTERS
FOR AMNESTY INTERNATIONAL.

23:02.542 --> 23:03.625
YOU'LL PROBABLY MAKE
A LOT OF NICE NEW FRIENDS.

23:03.625 --> 23:06.250
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I'VE GOT
A BETTER IDEA.

23:06.250 --> 23:07.667
HOW ABOUT
ME AND THE CAR

23:07.667 --> 23:08.708
WE GO BACK
TO GRAMS' HOUSE

23:08.708 --> 23:10.625
AND WE PICK YOU UP
IN THE MORNING?

23:10.625 --> 23:12.208
BESIDES, JACK,
I THOUGHT THAT YOU TWO

23:12.208 --> 23:13.834
WERE JUST GETTING
TO KNOW EACH OTHER.

23:15.583 --> 23:16.500

24:25.250 --> 24:26.834
IT'S NOT THAT KIND
OF CLUB.

24:26.834 --> 24:28.708
IT'S A LOCKER ROOM
AND A HANDBALL COURT,

24:28.708 --> 24:30.834
AND TO SLEEP THERE
I'D HAVE TO KEEP
WINNING THE SERVE.

24:30.834 --> 24:33.959
NO, STOP RIGHT THERE.
PACEY, IN THEORY,
YOUR CHARACTER

24:33.959 --> 24:36.834
MAY DELIVER
HIS LINES LIKE THAT,
BUT IN CONCEPT, NO.

24:36.834 --> 24:38.375
IN CONCEPT, NO.

24:38.375 --> 24:39.667
YES.

24:39.667 --> 24:41.250
WHAT PRECISELY
IS THE DIFFERENCE

24:41.250 --> 24:43.333
BETWEEN IN THEORY
AND IN CONCEPT?

24:43.333 --> 24:45.208
WELL, I THINK
WHAT MR. BRODERICK
MEANS IS--

24:45.208 --> 24:48.583
WHAT MR. BRODERICK MEANS
IS THAT HE CAN SPEAK
FOR HIMSELF.

24:48.583 --> 24:53.667
YOU SEE, PAUL DESIRES
HIS YOUNG BRIDE TO KNOW

24:53.667 --> 24:56.500
SHE KNOWS NOTHING
OF THE REAL WORLD.

24:56.500 --> 24:59.250
RIGHT. WHICH,
PRACTICALLY SPEAKING,
MEANS WHAT?

24:59.250 --> 25:03.125
LOUDER AND ANGRIER.

25:03.125 --> 25:06.041
LOUDER AND ANGRIER.

25:06.041 --> 25:07.917
YES. LET'S DO IT AGAIN,
RIGHT NOW.

25:07.917 --> 25:10.625
LOUDER AND ANGRIER.

25:12.542 --> 25:13.708
IT'S NOT
THAT KIND OF CLUB!

25:13.708 --> 25:16.500
IT'S A HANDBALL COURT
WITH A LOCKER ROOM,

25:16.500 --> 25:18.667
AND TO STAY THERE
I'D HAVE TO KEEP ON
WINNING MY SERVE.

25:18.667 --> 25:20.417
GOOD. I LIKED IT.

25:20.417 --> 25:22.583
YOU LIKED THAT?

25:22.583 --> 25:23.375
WELL, EXCEPT
FOR THE HAND STUFF.

25:23.375 --> 25:26.166
YOU WERE GESTICULATING.

25:26.166 --> 25:28.375
WHOA, HEY.
GESTICULATING? ME? NEVER.

25:28.375 --> 25:29.959
SOMETIMES IN THE PRIVACY
OF MY BEDROOM--

25:29.959 --> 25:31.083
WHOA, WAIT,
WAIT, PACEY.

25:31.083 --> 25:34.417
THAT, JUST NOW.
THAT'S IT.
YOU NAILED IT.

25:34.417 --> 25:36.125
WHAT, JUST NOW?

25:36.125 --> 25:38.333
THE JOKE. THE DRY,
SMUG DELIVERY.

25:38.333 --> 25:40.625
THAT'S
THE CHARACTER.

25:40.625 --> 25:42.000
UH, MISS McPHEE?

25:42.000 --> 25:44.500
AM I, OR AM I NOT
THE DIRECTOR HERE?

25:44.500 --> 25:45.417
YOU'RE CONFUSING MY ACTORS.

25:45.417 --> 25:49.041
WELL, I JUST
THOUGHT THAT--

25:49.041 --> 25:51.667
DON'T THINK. EVER.

25:51.667 --> 25:55.834
LET'S DO IT AGAIN.
LOUDER AND ANGRIER.

26:01.333 --> 26:03.041
IT'S NOT
THAT KIND OF CLUB!

26:03.041 --> 26:05.625
IT'S A HANDBALL COURT
WITH A LOCKER ROOM
ATTACHED TO IT.

26:05.625 --> 26:08.667
AND TO STAY THERE
I'D HAVE TO KEEP ON
WINNING MY SERVE.

26:08.667 --> 26:12.500
THIS IS REALLY COOL
OF YOU GUYS.

26:12.500 --> 26:14.000
YOU SURE JEN'S
NOT GONNA MIND

26:14.000 --> 26:15.166
IF I TAKE
HER SLEEPING BAG?

26:15.166 --> 26:16.125
NO, NO.
DEFINITELY NOT.

26:16.125 --> 26:19.166
SHE'S, UH, SHE'S A BIT
OF A NIGHT OWL.

26:19.166 --> 26:20.208
OLD GIRLFRIEND?

26:20.208 --> 26:23.875
NO, NOT EXACTLY, BUT
WE DID GET SET UP ONCE.

26:23.875 --> 26:25.917
LET ME GUESS.
SCHOOL DANCE.

26:25.917 --> 26:27.583
YEAH. HOW'D YOU KNOW?

26:27.583 --> 26:31.375
OH, PUNCH BOWL,
WRIST CORSAGE,

26:31.375 --> 26:32.667
ALL THE TRAPPINGS
OF STRAIGHTDOM.

26:32.667 --> 26:37.583
UNTIL YOU REALIZE
YOU BOTH LIKE BOYS.

26:37.583 --> 26:40.750
OLDEST STORY
IN THE WORLD.

26:45.417 --> 26:48.917
WELL, GOOD NIGHT.

26:48.917 --> 26:52.917
UM, GOOD NIGHT.

26:56.750 --> 26:59.000
AREN'T YOU GONNA
TURN OFF THE LIGHT?

26:59.000 --> 27:03.125
LOOK, I--I WAS
JUST THINKING MAYBE, UM,

27:03.125 --> 27:06.667
THAT WE COULD
TALK SOME MORE?

27:06.667 --> 27:09.917
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I'M REALLY BEAT.

27:09.917 --> 27:12.458
WE'VE GOT A BIG DAY
AHEAD OF US
TOMORROW.

27:12.458 --> 27:14.625
THERE'S 20 BANDS
STARTING
AT DAYBREAK.

27:28.458 --> 27:30.667
HEY.

27:31.625 --> 27:34.625
THAT WAS
REALLY BEAUTIFUL.

27:34.625 --> 27:36.667
I MEAN, IT WAS MORE
THAN BEAUTIFUL.

27:36.667 --> 27:39.291
IT WAS--IT WAS AWESOME.

27:39.291 --> 27:43.166
WHATEVER.

27:43.166 --> 27:44.959
I DIDN'T KNOW
THAT YOU COULD SING.

27:44.959 --> 27:46.083
I THINK
WE ESTABLISHED

27:46.083 --> 27:49.333
THERE'S A LOT
YOU DON'T KNOW
ABOUT ME.

27:49.333 --> 27:51.375
HENRY? HENRY,
WAIT UP FOR ME.

27:51.375 --> 27:53.834
WHY?

27:53.834 --> 27:56.166
BECAUSE I WANTED
TO TALK TO YOU.

27:56.166 --> 27:58.291
YOU CAN'T--
YOU CAN'T KEEP
DOING THIS TO ME.

27:58.291 --> 28:00.667
DOING WHAT?

28:00.667 --> 28:01.792
TRYING TO
BE MY FRIEND,

28:01.792 --> 28:02.875
AND THEN
PUSHING ME AWAY

28:02.875 --> 28:04.792
WHEN--
WHEN MY FEELINGS
SCARE YOU.

28:08.792 --> 28:12.125
OK, I ADMIT IT.
I MISS YOU.

28:12.125 --> 28:16.333
I MISS THE GOOFY WAY
THAT YOU USED TO LOOK AT ME

28:16.333 --> 28:20.083
WITH ALL THAT PASSION
AND INTENSITY.

28:20.083 --> 28:26.625
YOU MADE ME FEEL LIKE
I WAS ACTUALLY WORTH
THE FUSS.

28:26.625 --> 28:31.917
YOU KNOW, I USED
TO SPEND EVERY DAY
THINKING ABOUT YOU

28:31.917 --> 28:36.250
AND DREAMING
ABOUT YOU,

28:36.250 --> 28:37.708
AND EVERY TIME
YOU WALKED BY,

28:37.708 --> 28:41.083
I LOST MYSELF.
DO YOU KNOW WHAT
THAT FEELS LIKE?

28:41.083 --> 28:43.542
DO YOU?

28:43.542 --> 28:44.417
NO.

28:44.417 --> 28:45.875
THEN YOU COULDN'T
POSSIBLY KNOW

28:45.875 --> 28:47.458
WHAT IT FEELS LIKE
TO HAVE THAT PERSON

28:47.458 --> 28:50.041
NOT HAVE THE SAME
FEELINGS BACK.

28:50.041 --> 28:55.375
LOOK, I'M SORRY
YOU MISS HOW
I LOOKED AT YOU,

28:55.375 --> 29:00.417
BUT I DON'T MISS
HOW YOU NEVER
LOOKED AT ME.

29:22.917 --> 29:27.041
HAVE I STEPPED INTO
SOME PARALLEL UNIVERSE?

29:27.041 --> 29:29.000
SAY IT ISN'T SO,
DAWSON.

29:29.000 --> 29:31.583
IT'S VERY SO, JO.

29:31.583 --> 29:34.708
IS THIS
ABOUT YOUR PARENTS?

29:34.708 --> 29:37.500
TRUTH BE TOLD,
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT IT'S ABOUT.

29:37.500 --> 29:39.917
ALL I KNOW IS I WAS
AT NIKKI'S HOUSE TODAY,

29:39.917 --> 29:42.750
WE WERE TALKING
AND IT HIT ME.

29:42.750 --> 29:47.708
THE KID WHO HUNG
THESE POSTERS UP,
I'M NOT HIM ANYMORE.

29:47.708 --> 29:49.542
I DON'T SEE THE WORLD
THE SAME WAY.

29:49.542 --> 29:51.083
MY VIEWPOINT THEN
WAS SO LIMITED.

29:51.083 --> 29:55.875
AND NOW
I...DON'T KNOW WHAT I SEE,
BUT I DON'T SEE THIS.

29:58.041 --> 30:01.250
SO YOU WERE
AT NIKKI'S HOUSE,
YOUR WORST ENEMY.

30:01.250 --> 30:02.625
A--SHE'S NOT
MY WORST ENEMY,

30:02.625 --> 30:04.500
B--HAVE YOU MISSED
EVERYTHING
THAT I'VE TOLD YOU?

30:04.500 --> 30:07.500
I NEVER THOUGHT
I'D SAY THIS ABOUT YOU,
DAWSON, BUT...

30:07.500 --> 30:09.250
YOU'RE SUCH A SELL-OUT.

30:09.250 --> 30:11.959
WHAT?

30:11.959 --> 30:14.083
I MEAN, FIRST EVE
PRACTICALLY TUGS YOU
AROUND BY A DOG COLLAR,

30:14.083 --> 30:16.959
AND NOW THIS NEW FILM GIRL
BREEZES INTO TOWN,

30:16.959 --> 30:19.000
AND YOU'RE TOSSING
YOUR IDENTITY OUT THE WINDOW.

30:19.000 --> 30:20.041
I'M NOT TOSSING MY IDENTITY
OUT THE WINDOW.

30:20.041 --> 30:22.583
IF ANYTHING, FOR
THE FIRST TIME IN MY LIFE,

30:22.583 --> 30:25.041
I'M ACTUALLY GETTING CLOSE
TO DISCOVERING WHAT
MY IDENTITY IS.

30:25.041 --> 30:26.542
ALL RIGHT.
I TALKED TO NIKKI.

30:26.542 --> 30:28.500
SHE HELPED ME
SORT THROUGH ALL THIS
WEIRDNESS WITH MY PARENTS.

30:28.500 --> 30:32.417
DAWSON, I WANTED TO TALK
TO YOU ABOUT THAT,
AND YOU DIDN'T WANT TO TALK.

30:32.417 --> 30:34.667
NO, I DIDN'T. HOW DID THIS
BECOME ALL ABOUT YOU?

30:34.667 --> 30:35.750
BECAUSE YOU RAN TO HER.

30:35.750 --> 30:36.959
I DID NOT--

30:36.959 --> 30:38.583
WHAT DID YOU DO THEN?

30:38.583 --> 30:41.917
LOOK, YOU WANNA CITE
THEMES FOR OUR FRIENDSHIP,
TRY THIS ON FOR SIZE, JOEY.

30:41.917 --> 30:44.708
EVERY TIME I EXPRESS
ONE IOTA OF INTEREST

30:44.708 --> 30:47.041
OR EVEN MERE RESPECT FOR
ANYONE OF THE OPPOSITE SEX,

30:47.041 --> 30:48.750
YOU ATTACK ME LIKE
I'M SOME SORT OF CRIMINAL.

30:48.750 --> 30:50.333
OH, AND YOU DON'T ATTACK ME?

30:50.333 --> 30:53.542
NO, I DON'T. AS YOU NOTICE,
I HAVE NOT ONCE ASKED ABOUT
MR. IVY LEAGUE.

30:53.542 --> 30:56.291
YEAH. THAT'S NOTED.
HIS NAME'S A.J. OK?

30:56.291 --> 30:59.542
AND MAYBE YOUR NOT
ASKING ME ABOUT HIM IS WORSE
THAN MY ATTACKING YOU, OK?

30:59.542 --> 31:01.208
NO. IT'S NOT.
MY CHOICE IS CIVIL.

31:01.208 --> 31:02.333
OH, AND I'M NOT CIVIL?

31:02.333 --> 31:03.792
NO. YOU'RE YELLING.
THAT'S NOT CIVIL.

31:03.792 --> 31:05.917
YOU'RE YELLING, TOO.

31:08.834 --> 31:12.208
OUT WITH THE OLD,
IN WITH THE NEW, HUH?

31:12.208 --> 31:14.500
HAVE FUN.

31:30.000 --> 31:33.875
Ethan: WELL, I'M GONNA
GO GRAB SOME BREAKFAST
BEFORE THE MUSIC STARTS.

31:33.875 --> 31:35.834
THANKS AGAIN FOR
LETTING ME CRASH HERE.

31:35.834 --> 31:38.208
Jack: SURE.

31:39.667 --> 31:43.375
AREN'T YOU FORGETTING
SOMETHING YOU'RE
SUPPOSED TO ASK ME FOR?

31:43.375 --> 31:45.959
I DON'T THINK SO.

31:45.959 --> 31:47.875
MY NUMBER, JACK.

31:47.875 --> 31:49.667
YOU KNOW, SO YOU CAN
CALL ME SOME TIME, WE
CAN TALK, GET TOGETHER.

31:49.667 --> 31:52.375
I DON'T GET THIS.

31:52.375 --> 31:56.083
I MEAN, LAST NIGHT,
YOU DIDN'T SEEM INTERESTED
ENOUGH TO WANT TO TALK TO ME,

31:56.083 --> 31:58.125
AND NOW ALL OF A SUDDEN,
YOU WANT ME
TO HAVE YOUR NUMBER.

31:58.125 --> 32:00.542
I WAS TIRED.
I WANTED TO SLEEP.

32:00.542 --> 32:02.375
THAT'S GOT NOTHING TO DO
WITH US BEING FRIENDS.

32:02.375 --> 32:04.500
FRIENDS.

32:04.500 --> 32:06.750
[SIGHS]

32:06.750 --> 32:11.000
I FIGURED YOU WERE
PROBABLY INTERESTED.

32:11.000 --> 32:13.166
AND YOU'RE NOT.

32:13.166 --> 32:16.375
EVEN IF I WAS, I WOULD
NEVER GO THERE WITH YOU.

32:16.375 --> 32:17.458
YOU'RE SO NOT READY.

32:17.458 --> 32:20.834
HOW COULD YOU POSSIBLY
KNOW WHAT I'M READY FOR?

32:20.834 --> 32:23.375
IT DOESN'T MEAN THAT I'M
NOT INTERESTED IN YOU, JACK.

32:23.375 --> 32:28.917
IT JUST MEANS THAT IF I'M
GONNA STAY IN YOUR LIFE,
AND I WANT TO,

32:28.917 --> 32:32.750
THAT I'M A LOT MORE LIKELY
TO STICK AROUND THIS WAY.

32:32.750 --> 32:35.792
SO YOU ARE INTERESTED.

32:35.792 --> 32:38.834
[CHUCKLES] NO COMMENT.

32:40.708 --> 32:42.959
WELL, THIS IS, UM...

32:42.959 --> 32:45.208
THIS IS SORT OF FUNNY.

32:45.208 --> 32:50.291
I MEAN, AS MUCH AS
I DIDN'T WANT TO ADMIT IT,

32:50.291 --> 32:54.041
YOU WERE THE FIRST GUY
THAT I WAS READY TO TAKE
THAT--THAT NEXT STEP WITH,

32:54.041 --> 32:56.208
AND YOU SAID NO.

32:57.250 --> 33:00.834
I GUESS I SHOULD BE
SOMEWHAT DISCOURAGED.

33:02.000 --> 33:05.250
I DON'T KNOW, I MEAN,
I'M BIZARRELY OPTIMISTIC...

33:05.250 --> 33:07.208
JUST TO KNOW THAT THERE'S
SOMEONE LIKE YOU OUT THERE.

33:15.625 --> 33:18.625
TAKE CARE, JACK.

33:23.750 --> 33:28.667
I HAD A DATE. I DITCHED
A PERFECTLY GOOD DATE
FOR A NON-REHEARSAL.

33:28.667 --> 33:30.333
OK. BE PATIENT.
HE'LL SHOW.

33:30.333 --> 33:34.291
OH, JOY, THEN WE CAN
DO MORE "LOUDER, ANGRIER."

33:36.750 --> 33:39.208
WHY NOT JUST START
WITHOUT THE GRAND POOBAH?

33:39.208 --> 33:40.583
I MEAN, ANDIE'S HERE.
SHE CAN DIRECT US.

33:40.583 --> 33:44.125
HOW ABOUT NOT? I'VE BEEN
IN THE DUNGEON ENOUGH,
THANK YOU.

33:44.125 --> 33:46.458
WHAT, ALL WE'RE GONNA DO
IS RUN A FEW LINES.

33:46.458 --> 33:50.875
BESIDES, WAS IT NOT YOU WHO
SAID THAT THIS IS ACTUALLY
YOUR  AFTER-SCHOOL ACTIVITY?

33:50.875 --> 33:51.125
HMM?

33:54.291 --> 33:56.000
OK. FINE.

33:56.000 --> 33:57.667
PACEY,
DO YOUR DEADPAN THING.

33:57.667 --> 34:01.667
CORIE, WHEN THE PHONE RINGS,
I WANT YOU TO DO IT JUST
LIKE THE STAGE DIRECTIONS.

34:01.667 --> 34:07.208
YOU KNOW, CONFIDENTIAL,
UM, LAUGHING AT TIMES,
PROVOCATIVE. OK?

34:07.208 --> 34:09.708
OK. ON MY DIRECTION.

34:11.542 --> 34:13.958
OK, AND BEGIN.

34:18.458 --> 34:19.875
THE STAGE IS OVER THERE.

34:19.875 --> 34:23.708
YOU LOST OR SOMETHING?

34:24.917 --> 34:26.500
KIND OF.

34:29.625 --> 34:32.833
ACTUALLY, I CAME
HERE TO APOLOGIZE.

34:32.833 --> 34:34.708
FOR WHAT?

34:37.000 --> 34:40.041
FOR BEING CARELESS
WITH YOUR HEART...

34:40.041 --> 34:44.291
AND FOR THINKING THAT
JUST BECAUSE I'M OLDER,
I KNEW BETTER.

34:46.750 --> 34:52.333
LAST NIGHT, I STAYED UP
ALL NIGHT THINKING ABOUT
WHAT YOU SAID AND...

34:52.333 --> 34:53.542
YOU'RE RIGHT.

34:53.542 --> 34:58.542
I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE
TO BE IN LOVE LIKE THAT.

34:58.542 --> 35:02.375
I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT'S
LIKE TO COMPLETELY LOSE
YOURSELF IN SOMEBODY ELSE...

35:06.125 --> 35:08.542
BUT I'D LIKE TO.

35:14.041 --> 35:18.458
AND IF ONE OF US IS YOUNGER
THAN THE OTHER HERE...

35:18.458 --> 35:21.333
I DON'T THINK THAT IT'S YOU,
HENRY.

35:21.917 --> 35:24.375
YOU GOT THAT RIGHT.

35:28.417 --> 35:30.333
NOW...

35:30.333 --> 35:34.000
HOW DO YOU LIKE YOUR COFFEE?

35:36.667 --> 35:38.458
CAN'T SAY
WE DIDN'T TRY.

35:38.458 --> 35:39.375
YEAH.
ALMOST 2 WHOLE WEEKS.

35:39.375 --> 35:43.625
BETTER THAN
FINDING OUT IN 2 YEARS.

35:43.625 --> 35:46.500
I LIKE IT. I LIKE
WHERE THIS IS GOING.

35:46.500 --> 35:48.208
YEAH, WE STARTED
RUNNING IT WITH ANDIE--

35:48.208 --> 35:50.041
ALL THOSE EXERCISES I'VE BEEN
THROWING OUT AT YOU
TO STRETCH YOUR RANGE,

35:50.041 --> 35:51.333
THEY'RE PAYING OFF
BEAUTIFULLY.

35:51.333 --> 35:54.083
MR. BRODERICK,
WE RAN THROUGH IT
WITH ANDIE.

35:54.083 --> 35:56.166
I LIKE THE PACING.
I LIKE THE FUNNY.
I LIKE THE ENERGY.

35:56.166 --> 35:57.875
ANDIE, GET THE SET DESIGNS,
WOULD YOU PLEASE?

35:57.875 --> 36:00.000
I'M TELLING YOU, ALL THOSE
THINGS WERE ANDIE'S IDEAS.

36:00.000 --> 36:03.667
NO, SIR. I MEAN,
I WAS BEGINNING TO DOUBT
MYSELF THERE FOR A MOMENT,

36:03.667 --> 36:06.208
BUT YOU GUYS ARE
DEFINITELY IN THE GROOVE.

36:06.208 --> 36:09.834
THE REST IS JUST GRUNT WORK--
MEMORIZATION, PACING,
THE EASY STUFF.

36:09.834 --> 36:11.792
ANDIE, THESE AREN'T
THE SET DESIGNS WE DISCUSSED.

36:11.792 --> 36:14.667
THEY ARE. I TOLD LAUREN
YOU WANTED A COMPLETELY
SIMPLISTIC SET:

36:14.667 --> 36:18.500
FREESTANDING DOORWAYS,
HANGING WINDOWS,
AND MINIMAL PROPS.

36:18.500 --> 36:20.708
WELL, THEN I CHANGED
MY MIND, DIDN'T I?

36:20.708 --> 36:24.250
I MEAN, THE ACTORS WILL SEND
THIS STUFF FLYING AROUND
THE STAGE LIKE A TRAPEZE.

36:24.250 --> 36:25.500
NO. BUT, MR. BRODERICK--

36:25.500 --> 36:30.291
ANDIE, DON'T ARGUE.
JUST FOLLOW ORDERS.

36:34.417 --> 36:38.417
ALL RIGHT, LET'S
RUN THE SCENE AGAIN.
SAME WAY, NO CHANGES.

36:45.458 --> 36:48.125
ANDIE, YOU CAN'T LEAVE
LIKE THIS, ALL RIGHT?

36:48.125 --> 36:49.625
THIS GUY THINKS
HE'S THEATER CAESAR.

36:49.625 --> 36:52.375
HE'S JUST TERRIFIED
THAT SOMEBODY'S GONNA
FIND OUT THAT HE'S NOT.

36:52.375 --> 36:55.333
NO. I CAN'T WORK
UNDER THESE CONDITIONS.
IT'S HARD ENOUGH AS IT IS.

36:55.333 --> 36:57.834
OK. ALL RIGHT.
IF IT'S HARD, I'LL QUIT.

36:57.834 --> 37:01.583
YOU CAN'T DO THAT.
I MEAN, YOU'RE--
YOU'RE ACTUALLY GOOD.

37:01.583 --> 37:05.542
THANK YOU, BUT THE FACT
STILL REMAINS THAT
YOU'RE BETTER, ALL RIGHT?

37:05.542 --> 37:08.708
AND WE NEED YOU IN THERE.
EVEN IF THAT GUY'S A JERK,
YOU GOTTA STICK IT OUT.

37:08.708 --> 37:11.333
I MEAN, I NEED YOU, McPHEE.

37:12.500 --> 37:16.041
WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO,
RESUME KISSING HIS ASS?

37:16.041 --> 37:17.667
YEAH, BASICALLY.

37:17.667 --> 37:19.667
WELL, IS HE GONNA
STAY OUT OF MY WAY?

37:19.667 --> 37:21.625
WHO, BRODERICK?
YOU'RE TALKING
CRAZY TALK.

37:21.625 --> 37:25.667
HE'D NEVER DO
ANYTHING LIKE THAT.
IT'D BE TOO EASY.

37:25.667 --> 37:27.875
ALL RIGHT. THEN
WHAT'S IN IT FOR ME?

37:27.875 --> 37:28.834
WELL, THAT DEPENDS.

37:28.834 --> 37:31.875
ARE WE TALKING
IN CONCEPT OR IN THEORY?

37:34.125 --> 37:36.417
WHAT'S THE VERDICT?
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO?
YES OR NO?

37:36.417 --> 37:39.583
I THINK NO.

37:39.583 --> 37:43.375
ALL RIGHT. GOOD. I MEAN,
ACTUALLY, THAT'S KIND OF
WHAT I EXPECTED YOU TO SAY.

37:43.375 --> 37:46.250
SO, UM, I'LL SEE YOU
AT REHEARSAL THEN.

37:46.250 --> 37:47.500
WELL, NO.
PACEY, I SAID NO.

37:47.500 --> 37:49.250
I'M SORRY.
WHAT DID YOU--
I CAN'T HEAR YOU.

37:49.250 --> 37:51.417
IT'S GOOD TO HEAR
YOU'RE SO FIRED UP
ABOUT THIS PROJECT.

37:51.417 --> 37:53.041
PACEY, I SAID NO!

37:53.041 --> 37:56.041
OH, PACEY, I SAID NO.

37:56.041 --> 37:59.875
Jen: SO ALL YOUR EFFORTS TO
SECURE SOME MAJOR FACE TIME
WITH THE NEW BEAU BACKFIRED?

37:59.875 --> 38:03.542
WELL, IT TURNS OUT
THAT THE GAY VERSION OF
THE "LET'S BE FRIENDS" SPEECH

38:03.542 --> 38:06.417
IS BASICALLY THE SAME
AS THE STRAIGHT VERSION.

38:06.417 --> 38:11.834
HMM. SO WOULD THAT MEAN
THAT THE PART WHERE YOU
WERE RUDE AND INSENSITIVE

38:11.834 --> 38:15.500
AND SENT ME OFF INTO THE
COLD, DARK NIGHT UNESCORTED,
THAT WAS ALL FOR NOTHING?

38:15.500 --> 38:19.667
RUDE IS SUCH A STRONG WORD.
I PREFER SOMETHING MORE
LIKE, UH...

38:19.667 --> 38:21.458
MOMENTARILY SELF-INVOLVED.

38:21.458 --> 38:24.500
THAT DOES HAVE
A CERTAIN RING TO IT.

38:24.500 --> 38:26.125
AM I FORGIVEN?

38:26.125 --> 38:29.792
YES, JACK.
YOU ARE FORGIVEN.

38:29.792 --> 38:31.834
YOU KNOW, IT'S
A HAPPY TURNING POINT
IN A GIRL'S LIFE

38:31.834 --> 38:35.291
WHEN HER GAY BEST FRIEND
FINALLY DUMPS HER
FOR ANOTHER BOY.

38:35.291 --> 38:37.291
THEY SHOULD
MAKE SOME SORT OF
GREETING CARD FOR THAT.

38:37.291 --> 38:38.583
HOLD ON.
WHAT HAPPENED?

38:38.583 --> 38:40.166
WHAT?

38:40.166 --> 38:42.125
THE GOOD ATTITUDE.
YOU'RE WIGGING ME OUT HERE.
EXPLAIN. WHAT'D I MISS?

38:42.125 --> 38:44.875
REMEMBER WHEN YOU SENT ME
INTO THE NIGHT AND TOLD ME
TO MAKE NEW FRIENDS?

38:44.875 --> 38:48.875
YES. I THOUGHT WE ALREADY
ESTABLISHED THAT WAS
NOT MY FINEST HOUR.

38:48.875 --> 38:51.208
I KNOW. WELL,
LET'S JUST SAY THAT--

38:51.208 --> 38:54.458
THAT WHILE I WAS
WANDERING AROUND,
I MAY HAVE...

38:54.458 --> 38:57.500
INADVERTENTLY
STUMBLED UPON SOMEBODY.

38:57.500 --> 39:01.125
A, UH, FRIEND?

39:01.125 --> 39:02.417
YEAH.

39:03.375 --> 39:05.500
ANYONE I KNOW?

39:05.500 --> 39:08.917
YEAH. YEAH. MOST DEFINITELY
SOMEONE THAT YOU KNOW.

39:08.917 --> 39:10.834
WHO IS IT?

39:10.834 --> 39:11.417
I'M NOT TELLING YOU.

39:11.417 --> 39:13.333
WHO IS IT?
UH-UH.

39:13.333 --> 39:14.667
[LAUGHING] YOU'RE NOT
GONNA GET IT OUT OF ME.

39:19.083 --> 39:21.125
[KNOCK ON WINDOW]

39:21.125 --> 39:24.834
DO I STILL HAVE
LADDER PRIVILEGES?

39:24.834 --> 39:27.208
I SUPPOSE SO.

39:32.166 --> 39:35.000
I COME BEARING GIFTS.

39:39.792 --> 39:43.291
YOU REMEMBER?
REMEMBER THAT SUMMER

39:43.291 --> 39:46.542
WE CAME ACROSS A PILE
OF MITCH AND GALE'S
OLD BEATLES ALBUMS,

39:46.542 --> 39:48.875
LISTENED TO THEM
ON THE PORCH
EVERY DAY FOR HOURS?

39:48.875 --> 39:51.542
GRAMS KEPT ON YELLING
FOR US TO TURN DOWN
THAT HIPPIE MUSIC.

39:51.542 --> 39:54.291
YEAH, AND YOU WANTED
TO BE JOHN LENNON.

39:54.291 --> 39:57.834
YOU WANTED TO WRITE SONGS
AND CHANGE THE WORLD
THROUGH MUSIC.

39:57.834 --> 39:58.875
I DID?

39:58.875 --> 40:01.291
YOU DID.

40:01.291 --> 40:02.792
YOU WEREN'T
JUST ABOUT SPIELBERG.

40:02.792 --> 40:07.333
YOU WEREN'T LIMITED.
YOU--YOU WERE
ABOUT SO MANY THINGS.

40:08.500 --> 40:12.041
I JUST WANTED
TO REMIND YOU OF THAT.

40:20.792 --> 40:26.250
I ALSO WANTED TO REMIND YOU
THAT EVEN THOUGH
SOMETIMES MY EMOTIONS,

40:26.250 --> 40:32.375
PARTICULARLY JEALOUSY, UH,
SOMETIMES GET THE BEST OF ME,

40:32.375 --> 40:34.917
I STILL HEAR YOU.

40:34.917 --> 40:38.417
NO MATTER HOW MUCH WE YELL
OR...

40:38.417 --> 40:41.000
NO MATTER HOW QUIET YOU ARE...

40:41.583 --> 40:45.417
I HEAR YOU, DAWSON.

40:47.959 --> 40:49.583
I HEAR YOU, TOO, JOEY.

40:54.417 --> 40:58.583
LISTEN,
I KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON
INSIDE OF YOU IS HUGE.

40:59.917 --> 41:02.667
IT'S OK IF YOU
DON'T SHARE IT WITH ME.

41:04.291 --> 41:07.667
JUST PROMISE ME
YOU'LL KEEP TRYING
TO SHARE IT WITH SOMEONE?

41:11.166 --> 41:14.208
DO YOU WANT
TO GIVE ME A HAND?

41:37.834 --> 41:39.250
HEH.

41:40.792 --> 41:42.125
SO WHAT DO YOU THINK?

41:42.125 --> 41:44.792
YOU THINK JOHN HERE
WILL INSPIRE ME
TO WALK MY OWN PATH?

41:44.792 --> 41:49.041
YOU'VE ALWAYS WALKED
YOUR OWN PATH, DAWSON.

41:49.041 --> 41:51.667
YOU JUST NEEDED
TO WIDEN IT A LITTLE.

41:53.500 --> 41:57.500
AND BE ON THE LOOKOUT
FOR YOUR YOKO.

42:10.834 --> 42:13.000
[♪♪♪]
