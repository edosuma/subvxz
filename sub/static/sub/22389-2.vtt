[jazz music]

00:04.000 --> 00:12.000
â™ª â™ª

00:19.030 --> 00:21.030
[cheers and applause]

00:21.030 --> 00:24.070
- From the Penn & Teller
Theater in Las Vegas, Nevada,

00:24.070 --> 00:27.500
here's our host,
Alyson Hannigan!

00:27.500 --> 00:30.500
[cheers and applause]

00:30.500 --> 00:34.969
â™ª â™ª

00:34.969 --> 00:37.969
[cheers and applause]

00:39.899 --> 00:41.600
- Thank you.

00:41.600 --> 00:43.429
[cheers and applause]

00:43.429 --> 00:46.000
Welcome to
"Penn & Teller: Fool Us."

00:46.000 --> 00:49.729
Some of you may remember me
from "Buffy the Vampire Slayer."

00:49.729 --> 00:51.130
[cheers and applause]

00:51.130 --> 00:52.829
Thank you.

00:52.829 --> 00:55.200
Well, my character
was a powerful sorceress.

00:55.200 --> 00:58.000
Of course, on that show,
all the magic I did

00:58.000 --> 01:00.969
used camera tricks
and special effects.

01:00.969 --> 01:03.200
This show
is completely different.

01:03.200 --> 01:05.400
Everything you see
is performed live

01:05.400 --> 01:07.769
with no sneaky edits
or cheating,

01:07.769 --> 01:10.129
which makes it
that much more amazing.

01:10.129 --> 01:13.500
And here they are now,
two real-life sorcerers,

01:13.500 --> 01:15.370
Penn and Teller.

01:15.370 --> 01:18.370
[cheers and applause]

01:18.370 --> 01:19.599
â™ª â™ª

01:19.599 --> 01:21.099
[indistinct chatter]

01:21.099 --> 01:22.469
â™ª â™ª

01:22.469 --> 01:23.930
Hello.

01:23.930 --> 01:25.700
â™ª â™ª

01:25.700 --> 01:27.799
Take your seats,
gentlemen.

01:27.799 --> 01:28.870
[cheers and applause]

01:28.870 --> 01:30.329
Whoo!

01:30.329 --> 01:34.000
[cheers and applause]

01:34.000 --> 01:37.000
As always, Penn and Teller
have no idea

01:37.000 --> 01:39.329
who any of the performers are
ahead of time.

01:39.329 --> 01:42.599
So let's give them
their first surprise.

01:45.729 --> 01:47.500
- Hi, my name is
Brett Loudermilk.

01:47.500 --> 01:49.400
I'm from Los Angeles,
California.

01:49.400 --> 01:52.030
And I do unusual things
with my body.

01:52.030 --> 01:53.799
[no audible dialogue]

01:53.799 --> 01:56.930
If you were to take two words
to describe what I do,

01:56.930 --> 01:58.729
it would be
the word "beautiful"

01:58.729 --> 02:00.129
and the word "disaster."

02:00.129 --> 02:01.329
And you put those together,

02:01.329 --> 02:03.329
and it sort of
gives you an idea

02:03.329 --> 02:05.299
of who I am
and what I like to present.

02:05.299 --> 02:08.729
I think I'm a weirdo,
but I'm well-adjusted.

02:08.729 --> 02:11.830
I think if somebody that
doesn't know me comes to see me

02:11.830 --> 02:14.530
and they see me
walk out onstage in a suit

02:14.530 --> 02:15.930
and then they see what I do,

02:15.930 --> 02:17.370
it's a total 180.

02:17.370 --> 02:18.729
[man laughing maniacally]

02:18.729 --> 02:19.800
Hold on.

02:19.800 --> 02:21.000
- [laughing maniacally]

02:21.000 --> 02:22.900
- What?
[laughter continues]

02:22.900 --> 02:24.670
I don't know what's hap--
[laughter continues]

02:24.670 --> 02:26.170
[whimsical music]

02:26.170 --> 02:27.969
I think a lot of people
would say,

02:27.969 --> 02:30.199
"What you're about to see
is hard to swallow."

02:30.199 --> 02:34.129
[cheers and applause]

02:34.129 --> 02:36.229
- Ready to duel Penn and Teller,

02:36.229 --> 02:39.670
please welcome Brett Loudermilk.

02:39.670 --> 02:41.170
- My name is Brett Loudermilk.

02:41.170 --> 02:43.099
I am a sword swallower.

02:43.099 --> 02:45.000
Not really that proud of it,
but it's a job.

02:45.000 --> 02:46.829
So that's what we're here to do.

02:46.829 --> 02:49.099
Let's go ahead and get started
with this one right here.

02:49.099 --> 02:50.900
And I'm gonna need a woman
from the--

02:50.900 --> 02:52.530
Actually, Alyson...
- Oh.

02:52.530 --> 02:53.770
- I'm gonna use you.

02:53.770 --> 02:54.969
You're gonna help me with this.

02:54.969 --> 02:55.969
We're gonna swallow a sword.

02:55.969 --> 02:57.170
- We?
- I.

02:57.170 --> 02:58.599
- Okay.
- I am gonna swallow a sword.

02:58.599 --> 02:59.800
Stand right over here
for me.

02:59.800 --> 03:01.400
- Oh, all right.

03:01.400 --> 03:03.199
- Alyson, I'm gonna place a
sword into my throat and let go.

03:03.199 --> 03:04.729
- Oh, God.

03:04.729 --> 03:06.300
- All right, I'm gonna hold it
there--are you okay?

03:06.300 --> 03:07.629
- I don't know.
- Okay, all right.

03:07.629 --> 03:09.800
I'll hold it in place with
the muscles of my esophagus.

03:09.800 --> 03:10.900
I'll let go.

03:10.900 --> 03:12.330
I'll snap my fingers,
open everything up.

03:12.330 --> 03:13.500
The sword's then
gonna drop down

03:13.500 --> 03:14.930
the rest of the way
by itself.

03:14.930 --> 03:17.300
It's gonna bump past my heart,
squeeze in between my lungs,

03:17.300 --> 03:18.900
end up somewhere
in the fallopian tubes.

03:18.900 --> 03:21.030
Once that happens, I'm gonna
bend myself into halves.

03:21.030 --> 03:23.170
I will turn towards you, Alyson,
and I will wink.

03:23.170 --> 03:24.770
When I wink,
you're gonna grab the sword

03:24.770 --> 03:26.030
and pull it out of me.

03:26.030 --> 03:27.270
- [groans]
- Alyson.

03:27.270 --> 03:29.599
- I might be on the floor
by then.

03:29.599 --> 03:31.129
- That'll be a problem.
- Oh, yeah.

03:31.129 --> 03:32.800
- Don't do this or this
or one of these.

03:32.800 --> 03:33.829
If you do this, I will die,

03:33.829 --> 03:35.300
and everyone here
will say you did it.

03:35.300 --> 03:36.300
Do you understand?
- Ah!

03:36.300 --> 03:37.770
- Good.
[laughter]

03:37.770 --> 03:39.670
- I don't know if I'm
the right person for this.

03:39.670 --> 03:41.030
- I don't know if you are,
either.

03:41.030 --> 03:43.170
- Okay.
- Okay.

03:43.170 --> 03:44.430
You want to practice?

03:44.430 --> 03:46.000
- I don't.

03:46.000 --> 03:47.329
- We are.
both: Okay.

03:47.329 --> 03:48.770
- Yeah, sword will be
inside my body.

03:48.770 --> 03:49.829
You will not see the blade.

03:49.829 --> 03:50.829
Do you understand?

03:50.829 --> 03:52.170
- Uh-huh.
- Okay.

03:52.170 --> 03:53.329
Okay, all right,
here we go.

03:53.329 --> 03:54.329
I will then bend over.

03:54.329 --> 03:55.599
When I wink,
what do you do?

03:55.599 --> 03:57.800
- Uh, throw up.

03:57.800 --> 04:00.629
[laughter]
All right.

04:00.629 --> 04:02.930
- Three, two...

04:02.930 --> 04:03.969
- Grab.
- Oh, God.

04:03.969 --> 04:05.300
- And pull.
- All right.

04:05.300 --> 04:07.500
- Just like that,
yes, perfect, perfect.

04:07.500 --> 04:08.629
- Okay.
- No, that was good.

04:08.629 --> 04:10.069
- Do I have to look?
- You need to look.

04:10.069 --> 04:11.199
- Oh, God.
- You need to look.

04:11.199 --> 04:12.629
- If you don't look,
I will die.

04:12.629 --> 04:14.129
- Okay, has this ever
gone wrong?

04:14.129 --> 04:15.169
- Yes.

04:15.169 --> 04:16.600
- Like, to your friends,
obviously?

04:16.600 --> 04:17.600
- Probably today.

04:17.600 --> 04:19.470
- Oh, jeez.
- Okay, here we go.

04:19.470 --> 04:20.899
- It'll be good
for the ratings.

04:20.899 --> 04:22.529
- [laughs]
- Mm.

04:22.529 --> 04:24.470
- Here we go.

04:24.470 --> 04:28.129
Oh, my God.

04:28.129 --> 04:29.300
[fingers snap]

04:29.300 --> 04:30.800
[audience exclaiming]
- Mm-mm.

04:30.800 --> 04:32.670
[applause]

04:32.670 --> 04:33.870
Oh, God.

04:33.870 --> 04:35.899
Oh, God, oh, God,
oh, God, oh, God, oh, God.

04:35.899 --> 04:36.899
Ahh...

04:36.899 --> 04:38.129
- Alyson!
- [groans]

04:38.129 --> 04:40.230
- Yes, yes!
[cheers and applause]

04:40.230 --> 04:41.300
- Ahh!
- Thank you.

04:41.300 --> 04:43.529
- Ahh. You're okay.
- Go away.

04:43.529 --> 04:44.829
- Oh, thank you.
- Go away.

04:44.829 --> 04:48.730
- [shuddering]

04:48.730 --> 04:49.970
- Sword swallowing is basically

04:49.970 --> 04:51.370
the same thing
over and over again.

04:51.370 --> 04:53.069
The sword goes in,
it comes out,

04:53.069 --> 04:54.899
I go home and cry
about my life choices.

04:54.899 --> 04:58.569
So I have decided to bring along
this one right here.

04:58.569 --> 05:02.370
This sword is what we call,
in the business, a wiggly one.

05:02.370 --> 05:05.129
Now, because of its shape,
when I swallow the blade,

05:05.129 --> 05:06.670
you're gonna see it
through my throat.

05:06.670 --> 05:08.430
As it goes in,
as it comes out,

05:08.430 --> 05:09.870
it's gonna do a little bit
of a dance.

05:09.870 --> 05:11.069
You ready?
- Yeah.

05:11.069 --> 05:12.670
- Yeah? Okay.

05:12.670 --> 05:14.529
Four of you.
Okay.

05:14.529 --> 05:16.170
[light laughter]

05:18.000 --> 05:19.730
[Alyson groaning]

05:19.730 --> 05:22.529
[audience exclaiming]

05:22.529 --> 05:23.970
- Oh!

05:23.970 --> 05:25.899
[audience exclaiming]

05:25.899 --> 05:27.300
- Yes!

05:27.300 --> 05:28.670
Yeah, all right!

05:28.670 --> 05:29.769
Oh, oh!

05:29.769 --> 05:30.930
I got one of these.

05:30.930 --> 05:32.069
I got this thing right here.

05:32.069 --> 05:34.269
This, this is an English

05:34.269 --> 05:38.199
cabinet maker's screwdriver
from 1865.

05:38.199 --> 05:39.899
I just wanted
to show you that...

05:39.899 --> 05:41.699
[laughter]

05:41.699 --> 05:45.699
Because this next one
is curved,

05:45.699 --> 05:46.970
as some of them are.

05:46.970 --> 05:47.970
- Mm-mm.

05:47.970 --> 05:50.970
[laughter]

05:52.129 --> 05:53.569
- Because of the shape
of this sword,

05:53.569 --> 05:54.730
when I swallow it,

05:54.730 --> 05:56.300
I have to bend myself
into the shape of it

05:56.300 --> 05:58.069
so that it doesn't puncture
anything inside

05:58.069 --> 05:59.129
that it's not supposed to,

05:59.129 --> 06:00.529
which is everything.

06:00.529 --> 06:01.699
Here we go.

06:01.699 --> 06:03.629
[laughter]

06:03.629 --> 06:05.670
Hmm, hmm, hmm.

06:10.500 --> 06:14.300
[audience exclaiming]

06:14.300 --> 06:15.500
- Oh!

06:15.500 --> 06:18.470
[cheers and applause]

06:18.470 --> 06:20.370
- Yes!

06:20.370 --> 06:23.730
I just swallowed
a curved sword!

06:23.730 --> 06:25.430
Come on!

06:25.430 --> 06:26.529
Yeah!

06:26.529 --> 06:29.129
[cheers and applause]

06:29.129 --> 06:30.769
You can't do it.

06:30.769 --> 06:32.699
- [laughing]

06:32.699 --> 06:34.069
- Now, I'm often asked

06:34.069 --> 06:36.470
if there are any practical
applications to sword swallowing

06:36.470 --> 06:38.300
aside from the obvious.

06:38.300 --> 06:39.529
And there are.

06:39.529 --> 06:41.370
There are.

06:41.370 --> 06:44.569
This...

06:44.569 --> 06:46.500
is a giant cutting board.

06:48.129 --> 06:50.870
This...

06:50.870 --> 06:54.629
is rice.

06:54.629 --> 06:58.370
Gonna...take a mouthful of this.

07:04.399 --> 07:08.069
Some rice, some seaweed.

07:08.069 --> 07:10.170
Very nutritious, very delicious.

07:10.170 --> 07:12.129
[laughter]

07:12.129 --> 07:13.699
And, of course,

07:13.699 --> 07:16.430
a bowl...

07:16.430 --> 07:17.899
of fish.

07:17.899 --> 07:21.069
[audience exclaiming]

07:21.069 --> 07:24.069
[audience shouting and laughing]

07:26.370 --> 07:29.069
Ugh, sorry
you had to see that.

07:29.069 --> 07:31.829
And, of course,
with all those things,

07:31.829 --> 07:36.829
we also have a giant...

07:36.829 --> 07:38.930
sushi knife.

07:47.730 --> 07:50.730
[audience exclaiming]

07:54.569 --> 07:56.069
[knife thuds]

08:01.430 --> 08:03.100
Sushi!

08:03.100 --> 08:06.100
[applause]

08:10.769 --> 08:12.699
Alyson, sushi.

08:12.699 --> 08:14.199
It's time to eat.
- Oh, yay.

08:14.199 --> 08:15.470
- It's time to eat;
there you go.

08:15.470 --> 08:16.569
- Wow.

08:16.569 --> 08:17.870
- Is that real sushi?
- Yeah.

08:17.870 --> 08:18.870
- Eat it.
- Well--

08:18.870 --> 08:19.899
- Eat it!
- You--

08:19.899 --> 08:20.899
- Put it in your mouth!

08:20.899 --> 08:22.300
Eat it. Eat it.
- Teller will.

08:22.300 --> 08:25.129
- Just smell it. Smell it.
- It's--it's great.

08:25.129 --> 08:26.470
- You guys want it?
- Teller...

08:26.470 --> 08:28.300
Teller will eat anything.
- Yeah? All right.

08:28.300 --> 08:30.269
[laughter]
[groaning]

08:30.269 --> 08:32.269
That is real sushi,
everyone.

08:32.269 --> 08:35.070
Brett Loudermilk!

08:35.070 --> 08:36.100
[cheers and applause]

08:36.100 --> 08:37.399
Okay.
- Hi.

08:37.399 --> 08:39.570
- That was...disturbing.

08:39.570 --> 08:41.029
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

08:41.029 --> 08:42.029
- Yeah, you were probably

08:42.029 --> 08:43.500
the worst assistant
I've ever had.

08:43.500 --> 08:46.500
- I--and, yeah, I could
have told you that.

08:46.500 --> 08:47.730
[both laugh]

08:47.730 --> 08:50.330
Why would you pick me
for a knife?

08:50.330 --> 08:52.200
Anything--
[shudders]

08:52.200 --> 08:53.200
- I don't know.

08:53.200 --> 08:54.399
I thought you could
handle it.

08:54.399 --> 08:56.500
I was wrong.
- No, no.

08:56.500 --> 08:57.500
- You did it.
- Yeah.

08:57.500 --> 08:59.169
- You did a great job;
I didn't die.

08:59.169 --> 09:00.399
- I'm glad
I didn't kill you.

09:00.399 --> 09:01.429
- They loved it.

09:01.429 --> 09:02.870
Right?
- I'm very, very glad.

09:02.870 --> 09:03.970
[cheers and applause]

09:03.970 --> 09:05.799
Yeah.
- Good.

09:05.799 --> 09:07.570
- You had me very nervous.

09:07.570 --> 09:10.330
I think it's time we just
go to Penn and Teller.

09:10.330 --> 09:11.870
- Sounds good to me.
- All right.

09:11.870 --> 09:14.029
Penn, Teller,
put me out of my misery.

09:14.029 --> 09:15.769
- [laughing] Okay.

09:15.769 --> 09:17.100
Brett, good to see you, man.

09:17.100 --> 09:18.429
- Good to see you.
- Good to see you.

09:18.429 --> 09:20.700
I got to tell you,
the good news is,

09:20.700 --> 09:23.470
it's not a trick.

09:23.470 --> 09:26.129
Many people think
sword swallowing is a trick.

09:26.129 --> 09:27.370
It's not a trick;
you did it for real.

09:27.370 --> 09:28.370
- Absolutely.

09:28.370 --> 09:30.669
- The bad news is,
it's not a trick.

09:30.669 --> 09:31.669
- Yeah.
- Um...

09:31.669 --> 09:33.470
- [laughs]
[laughter]

09:33.470 --> 09:34.830
I have done
sword swallowing.

09:34.830 --> 09:35.830
- I know, yeah.

09:35.830 --> 09:38.129
- And I did it
very, very badly.

09:38.129 --> 09:41.500
And I did the stupid thing
of trying to learn it on video

09:41.500 --> 09:44.169
with someone teaching me
in a very short period of time.

09:44.169 --> 09:46.070
And I did real damage to myself.
- Yeah.

09:46.070 --> 09:47.730
- It's a wicked hard thing
to do,

09:47.730 --> 09:50.029
and you do it just
absolutely beautifully.

09:50.029 --> 09:51.899
Sushi's real at the end.

09:51.899 --> 09:53.299
Sword swallowing is real.

09:53.299 --> 09:54.870
There's one trick
in the middle.

09:54.870 --> 09:57.230
I'm gonna say a few words
to you very quickly.

09:57.230 --> 09:58.830
Load foam switch.

09:58.830 --> 10:00.470
- Done.

10:00.470 --> 10:01.700
- [laughing]
[laughter]

10:01.700 --> 10:02.929
- Guess you're not
gonna tell us that.

10:02.929 --> 10:04.269
- Yeah, don't worry about it.
- All right.

10:04.269 --> 10:05.669
- But the sword swallowing
is all real.

10:05.669 --> 10:07.700
- Okay, so you didn't fool them,
but you grossed me out.

10:07.700 --> 10:08.870
- Perfect.
- Yeah.

10:08.870 --> 10:10.700
So, thank you,
Brett Loudermilk!

10:10.700 --> 10:13.399
[cheers and applause]
- Thank you, thank you.

10:13.399 --> 10:15.830
- Thank you!
- Thanks.

10:15.830 --> 10:18.370
- [exhales]

10:18.370 --> 10:20.269
Okay.

10:20.269 --> 10:23.000
Let me use
my mind reading skills.

10:23.000 --> 10:24.200
Think of a commercial.

10:24.200 --> 10:25.230
Got it?

10:25.230 --> 10:27.500
Now I will show it to you.

10:27.500 --> 10:28.970
We'll be back.

10:28.970 --> 10:31.299
[jazz music]

10:31.299 --> 10:34.470
[applause]

10:38.899 --> 10:41.700
[jazz music]

10:41.700 --> 10:44.700
[applause]

10:44.700 --> 10:47.570
- Welcome back to
"Penn & Teller: Fool Us."

10:47.570 --> 10:50.700
I can't wait to believe
my eyes even less,

10:50.700 --> 10:53.330
so let's meet
our next potential fooler.

10:55.929 --> 10:57.330
- I'm Dan Harlan,

10:57.330 --> 10:59.129
and I'm a creative genius.

10:59.129 --> 11:01.769
[jazz music]

11:01.769 --> 11:03.269
I grew up in the theater.

11:03.269 --> 11:04.600
What I didn't know at the time

11:04.600 --> 11:06.429
was that my mom
had been a magician's assistant

11:06.429 --> 11:07.830
before I was born.

11:07.830 --> 11:10.000
She had performed some
amazing magic for us as kids,

11:10.000 --> 11:14.100
but I really didn't know
where her magic came from.

11:14.100 --> 11:17.600
One of her best tricks, I think,
was to produce a bar of soap

11:17.600 --> 11:19.899
from behind my ear
to get me to take my bath.

11:19.899 --> 11:23.799
I think that's the real magic
of a mother, right there.

11:23.799 --> 11:26.269
Tonight I'll be performing
one of my inventions.

11:26.269 --> 11:29.600
It's the most popular card trick
of the modern age.

11:29.600 --> 11:31.029
I wouldn't be surprised at all

11:31.029 --> 11:35.370
if Penn and Teller already know
how this trick is done,

11:35.370 --> 11:37.830
but I've got a twist for 'em.

11:37.830 --> 11:41.769
[cheers and applause]

11:41.769 --> 11:44.169
- Our next performer
first hit the stage

11:44.169 --> 11:46.230
when he was two years old.

11:46.230 --> 11:48.830
I wonder if he regrets
all the time he wasted

11:48.830 --> 11:51.370
for the first 23 months
of his life.

11:51.370 --> 11:53.899
Please welcome Dan Harlan.

11:53.899 --> 11:56.529
[cheers and applause]
- Thank you so much.

11:56.529 --> 11:59.399
Thank you, everyone.

11:59.399 --> 12:01.129
I'm a creator of magic,

12:01.129 --> 12:03.769
and I wanted to share with you
one of my favorite creations.

12:03.769 --> 12:06.830
It's also been very popular with
magicians around the world--

12:06.830 --> 12:09.730
something I came up with
25 years ago.

12:09.730 --> 12:11.769
And it uses this deck of cards

12:11.769 --> 12:16.269
on which I've drawn a picture,
a little stick-figure magician.

12:16.269 --> 12:17.799
I haven't just drawn him
on this card.

12:17.799 --> 12:19.669
I've actually drawn him
on all of the cards,

12:19.669 --> 12:22.570
and all of those pictures
are a little bit different,

12:22.570 --> 12:27.070
so that if I do this,
he appears to move.

12:27.070 --> 12:29.529
He reaches up,
takes off his hat,

12:29.529 --> 12:31.070
and he's about
to pull something out,

12:31.070 --> 12:34.169
but, you know, I don't want you
to see what that is yet,

12:34.169 --> 12:36.000
because I'm gonna need
a card named.

12:36.000 --> 12:38.529
Now, I could just ask Penn
to name a card,

12:38.529 --> 12:40.769
but he would say the three
of clubs, most likely, and...

12:40.769 --> 12:41.929
- [laughs]

12:41.929 --> 12:43.769
- I'm gonna use
the time-honored, traditional

12:43.769 --> 12:45.370
committee method.

12:45.370 --> 12:46.970
Now, since I don't know
anyone here,

12:46.970 --> 12:48.529
I'm just gonna select somebody.

12:48.529 --> 12:50.169
And I'm gonna toss
my little friend here.

12:50.169 --> 12:51.169
He's for good luck.

12:51.169 --> 12:52.470
His name is Bones.

12:52.470 --> 12:55.330
Here we go.

12:55.330 --> 12:56.669
Oh, right next to you.

12:56.669 --> 12:57.669
Can you get him?

12:57.669 --> 12:58.669
Yeah, fantastic.

12:58.669 --> 12:59.899
Will you stand for me, please?

12:59.899 --> 13:01.299
Hi.

13:01.299 --> 13:03.299
[laughs]
[applause]

13:03.299 --> 13:04.870
And what is your name?

13:04.870 --> 13:06.169
- Erica.

13:06.169 --> 13:07.769
- Erica, here's what
I'd like you to do.

13:07.769 --> 13:09.769
I want you to imagine
that you have

13:09.769 --> 13:11.330
an invisible deck of cards,

13:11.330 --> 13:13.500
and you've separated them,
for some reason or another,

13:13.500 --> 13:14.929
into the red cards on one side

13:14.929 --> 13:16.830
and the black cards
on the other side.

13:16.830 --> 13:19.600
So you have two
imaginary piles there.

13:19.600 --> 13:20.629
And what I'd like you to do

13:20.629 --> 13:22.500
is to select
one of them to keep.

13:22.500 --> 13:25.000
Whatever you choose
is what we'll use.

13:25.000 --> 13:27.269
So would you like the red cards
or the black cards?

13:27.269 --> 13:29.330
- The red cards.
- The red cards?

13:29.330 --> 13:31.029
Well, then, we'll take
the black cards

13:31.029 --> 13:32.029
and just toss them away.

13:32.029 --> 13:33.230
Do the same thing in your mind.

13:33.230 --> 13:34.470
Now, I'd like you to take Bones

13:34.470 --> 13:37.470
and hand him
to the person next to you.

13:37.470 --> 13:38.929
And thanks.
You may be seated.

13:38.929 --> 13:39.929
Thank you so very much.

13:39.929 --> 13:42.600
And would you please
stand for me?

13:42.600 --> 13:44.269
Hi. An applause
for her as well.

13:44.269 --> 13:45.529
[applause]

13:45.529 --> 13:46.570
And what's your name?

13:46.570 --> 13:47.570
- Troynetta.

13:47.570 --> 13:48.700
- Troynetta.
- Yes.

13:48.700 --> 13:49.700
- Yeah. Oh, terrific.

13:49.700 --> 13:50.899
Okay, so, Troynetta,

13:50.899 --> 13:52.370
your choice is
a little more limited.

13:52.370 --> 13:53.669
We've got the red cards here,

13:53.669 --> 13:55.429
and you're going to imagine
separating them

13:55.429 --> 13:58.330
into the hearts
and the diamonds,

13:58.330 --> 14:00.330
and then you're gonna choose
which ones we keep,

14:00.330 --> 14:01.570
same as your friend.

14:01.570 --> 14:03.769
So would you like
the hearts or the diamonds?

14:03.769 --> 14:05.399
- The hearts.
- The hearts.

14:05.399 --> 14:07.830
Well, I've forgotten
which side we put them on, so...

14:07.830 --> 14:09.299
It's all imagination anyway.

14:09.299 --> 14:11.200
We'll just toss those
and call these the hearts.

14:11.200 --> 14:12.429
Would you do me a favor

14:12.429 --> 14:14.330
and then hand Bones
to the person next to you?

14:14.330 --> 14:16.230
And thank you so much.
You may be seated.

14:16.230 --> 14:18.000
And, sir, stand up.
[applause]

14:18.000 --> 14:19.629
This applause is for you.

14:19.629 --> 14:22.970
[applause]

14:22.970 --> 14:24.000
What's your name, sir?

14:24.000 --> 14:25.000
- Scott.

14:25.000 --> 14:26.399
- So, Scott,

14:26.399 --> 14:28.399
your choice is a little more
complicated than the first two,

14:28.399 --> 14:29.700
but I'm sure you're
way ahead of me here.

14:29.700 --> 14:31.230
You're going to,
in your imagination,

14:31.230 --> 14:33.169
spread out the cards.

14:33.169 --> 14:35.230
These are the hearts.

14:35.230 --> 14:38.029
So we have 13 of them,

14:38.029 --> 14:40.230
and you're going to choose
just one to keep,

14:40.230 --> 14:42.799
all from the obvious ace

14:42.799 --> 14:44.600
to the desirable jack,
queen, and king,

14:44.600 --> 14:46.230
or all of the numbers
in between.

14:46.230 --> 14:49.100
It really is your choice.

14:49.100 --> 14:51.169
Which one of those
should we keep?

14:51.169 --> 14:52.169
- The ten of hearts.

14:52.169 --> 14:53.799
- The ten of hearts.

14:53.799 --> 14:55.500
So, in your imagination,

14:55.500 --> 14:57.000
I want you to separate out--

14:57.000 --> 14:58.600
I'm not sure exactly.

14:58.600 --> 15:00.600
I think it's right about there.

15:00.600 --> 15:02.070
You separate out
all the other cards,

15:02.070 --> 15:03.370
and you toss them aside.

15:03.370 --> 15:06.230
Leave the ten of hearts
right out in the open like that.

15:06.230 --> 15:07.230
That's fantastic.

15:07.230 --> 15:10.370
And then toss Bones up to me.

15:10.370 --> 15:12.629
Not bad, ooh, almost.

15:12.629 --> 15:15.029
Again, don't be concerned
about him.

15:15.029 --> 15:16.070
It's his job.

15:16.070 --> 15:17.500
[laughter]
[laughs]

15:17.500 --> 15:18.830
He's gonna watch
the rest of this

15:18.830 --> 15:20.429
from right here in my pocket.

15:20.429 --> 15:22.700
Now, if I remember correctly,

15:22.700 --> 15:25.429
you've all decided
on the ten of hearts, yes?

15:25.429 --> 15:28.269
And you won't be surprised
that there is, in fact,

15:28.269 --> 15:30.669
a ten of hearts in this deck.

15:30.669 --> 15:33.370
And so I'm gonna replace
your imagination

15:33.370 --> 15:36.470
with something very, very real,

15:36.470 --> 15:39.799
an actual card,
the ten of hearts,

15:39.799 --> 15:42.370
so that we don't forget
which one you've chosen.

15:42.370 --> 15:45.929
And now...let's see
the magician perform.

15:48.799 --> 15:51.769
He reaches up.

15:51.769 --> 15:54.200
He takes off his hat.

15:54.200 --> 15:55.769
He reaches inside.

15:55.769 --> 15:58.799
Now, most people expect him
to pull out a rabbit.

15:58.799 --> 16:01.600
And those do look like ears,
but they're not.

16:01.600 --> 16:04.070
Those are the corners
of a folded card.

16:04.070 --> 16:06.100
When he pulls it out
all the way, it unfolds,

16:06.100 --> 16:07.370
and he takes a look at it,

16:07.370 --> 16:09.330
and he looks pretty happy,

16:09.330 --> 16:11.070
because when he turns it over,

16:11.070 --> 16:15.830
it is the ten of hearts...

16:15.830 --> 16:16.899
[applause]

16:16.899 --> 16:20.370
The very same one.

16:20.370 --> 16:23.700
[cheers and applause]
[laughs] Thank you.

16:23.700 --> 16:27.200
- Wow, Dan Harlan, everyone!
- Thank you.

16:27.200 --> 16:29.600
- Wow.
- Hi, Alyson.

16:29.600 --> 16:30.600
- That was fantastic.

16:30.600 --> 16:31.929
- Well, thanks,
thanks very much.

16:31.929 --> 16:33.029
- And I love your drawings.

16:33.029 --> 16:34.269
- Well, thanks, yeah.

16:34.269 --> 16:36.370
- I'm a big fan
of stick figure drawings.

16:36.370 --> 16:38.429
- Oh, yeah, me too,
obviously, right?

16:38.429 --> 16:41.230
- So you invent magic tricks.

16:41.230 --> 16:42.330
- I sure do, yep.

16:42.330 --> 16:45.899
- And then they sell
like hotcakes.

16:45.899 --> 16:47.100
- Well, many of them do.

16:47.100 --> 16:48.669
You know, the way it is
with inventions,

16:48.669 --> 16:50.029
some sell better than others.

16:50.029 --> 16:51.029
You just got to keep at it

16:51.029 --> 16:52.570
until you come up
with something good.

16:52.570 --> 16:55.399
- But you have,
if I'm not mistaken,

16:55.399 --> 16:57.230
the magic trick that's sold

16:57.230 --> 16:59.470
the most out of
any magic tricks?

16:59.470 --> 17:02.230
- That would be
this one right here.

17:02.230 --> 17:03.929
- That's so cool.

17:03.929 --> 17:05.970
And then you decided

17:05.970 --> 17:08.430
to bring it on
to fool Penn and Teller.

17:08.430 --> 17:10.098
- Sure, you know.

17:10.098 --> 17:11.630
- What if they've bought it?

17:11.630 --> 17:14.900
- It's very likely
that they know this trick.

17:14.900 --> 17:16.529
As a matter of fact,
I brought it on

17:16.529 --> 17:20.000
because it's my first chance
to perform it

17:20.000 --> 17:22.029
on television for everybody,

17:22.029 --> 17:23.829
and I really wanted to do

17:23.829 --> 17:25.670
something that's close
to my heart.

17:25.670 --> 17:28.000
- Okay, well, it's time
to go to the boys.

17:28.000 --> 17:31.799
- How many tricks
can someone get in magic

17:31.799 --> 17:34.970
that they can buy in a shop
and that they could learn

17:34.970 --> 17:38.700
and is good enough to destroy
people on national TV?

17:38.700 --> 17:40.529
Absolutely destroy them.

17:40.529 --> 17:43.769
Every magic trick I see,
I get sick to death of.

17:43.769 --> 17:46.769
I've seen this thing
probably a hundred times.

17:46.769 --> 17:47.970
I love it every time,

17:47.970 --> 17:49.970
but I've never seen
the creator do it.

17:49.970 --> 17:51.799
Fabulous, wonderful,
just wonderful.

17:51.799 --> 17:52.970
- Aw.
- Thank you, yes.

17:52.970 --> 17:54.299
Thank you so much.
[applause]

17:54.299 --> 17:55.869
- Aw.
- Thank you.

17:55.869 --> 17:57.730
Thanks, thanks.
Well, whether--

17:57.730 --> 17:58.869
- And you didn't fake us out

17:58.869 --> 18:01.130
with the reach under
the table, either; go ahead.

18:01.130 --> 18:02.700
- No, I didn't.
I didn't, right?

18:02.700 --> 18:04.230
- It's a perfect use
of a deck of cards.

18:04.230 --> 18:06.569
And I also love
the little inside thing,

18:06.569 --> 18:08.970
that, in gambling parlance,

18:08.970 --> 18:11.329
to look for marked cards,
you flip through them,

18:11.329 --> 18:13.029
and it's called
"going to the movies."

18:13.029 --> 18:14.799
And I love the fact
that you made that real.

18:14.799 --> 18:16.099
- I love that too, yeah.

18:16.099 --> 18:20.329
Now, I do have to say
one thing, though.

18:20.329 --> 18:23.099
And you may not like this.

18:23.099 --> 18:28.029
But because of what you've said,
I absolutely have to say it.

18:28.029 --> 18:30.769
This deck of cards,

18:30.769 --> 18:33.430
I drew it especially
for this show.

18:33.430 --> 18:34.529
- Uh-huh?

18:34.529 --> 18:37.769
- And...

18:37.769 --> 18:41.299
there isn't...

18:41.299 --> 18:46.500
anything unusual
about the cards at all.

18:46.500 --> 18:48.799
As a matter of fact,

18:48.799 --> 18:50.799
these cards, all of them,

18:50.799 --> 18:53.930
just have the drawings
that reveal

18:53.930 --> 18:57.700
just the ten of hearts
and only the ten of hearts,

18:57.700 --> 18:59.869
and it worked.

18:59.869 --> 19:01.029
- What?

19:01.029 --> 19:03.029
What does that mean?
- [laughing]

19:03.029 --> 19:04.329
- What does it mean?
What does it mean?

19:04.329 --> 19:05.700
- It means...
- I mean, come up here now.

19:05.700 --> 19:08.069
- It means that you guys...
- [speaks indistinctly]

19:08.069 --> 19:09.769
- [laughing]
- [speaks indistinctly]

19:09.769 --> 19:11.230
[cheers and applause]
I noticed...

19:11.230 --> 19:13.529
- Yeah.
- [laughs]

19:13.529 --> 19:15.000
- Now you had to bring them up.

19:15.000 --> 19:16.500
- And...
- Wow!

19:16.500 --> 19:17.500
- For your very own.

19:17.500 --> 19:18.869
- Wow, wow!

19:18.869 --> 19:20.029
- You may keep them.

19:20.029 --> 19:22.369
I don't know
how you'll divide them.

19:22.369 --> 19:24.529
- Gentlemen, Dan Harlan!
- Wow, that's amazing!

19:24.529 --> 19:26.730
Beautifully done
at every level.

19:26.730 --> 19:28.029
- Thank you.
- Just perfect.

19:28.029 --> 19:30.569
- Thank you,
oh, so nice, so nice.

19:30.569 --> 19:33.599
- That is so incredible.
- [laughs] Yeah.

19:33.599 --> 19:34.829
Thanks, everybody.
- Set on fire.

19:34.829 --> 19:36.470
Thanks again, man.
- Thanks, man.

19:36.470 --> 19:38.230
- That's beautiful.

19:38.230 --> 19:39.829
- Thank you.
Thank you so very much.

19:39.829 --> 19:41.269
Bye.

19:41.269 --> 19:42.470
- Wow!

19:42.470 --> 19:43.500
[cheers and applause]

19:43.500 --> 19:46.430
Wow.
- [laughs]

19:46.430 --> 19:48.430
I bet two people on this stage

19:48.430 --> 19:51.369
feel a little less smart
right now.

19:51.369 --> 19:53.099
Penn and Teller, fooled.

19:53.099 --> 19:56.099
We'll let them recover
during this commercial break.

19:56.099 --> 19:58.329
[cheers and applause]
- Wow!

19:58.329 --> 20:00.230
Wowie zowie.

20:00.230 --> 20:02.569
[jazz music]

20:06.970 --> 20:09.970
[jazz music]

20:09.970 --> 20:13.970
[cheers and applause]

20:13.970 --> 20:15.500
- Welcome back to "Fool Us."

20:15.500 --> 20:18.130
And so far tonight,
one magician has managed

20:18.130 --> 20:20.069
to fool our dynamic duo.

20:20.069 --> 20:23.529
Let's see if we can go for two,
as we meet our next performer.

20:26.130 --> 20:27.769
- My name is Ryan Joyce.

20:27.769 --> 20:29.200
I'm a magician
and an illusionist.

20:29.200 --> 20:31.630
I come from a small country
called Canada.

20:31.630 --> 20:33.599
I view magic
kind of like a first date.

20:33.599 --> 20:35.230
Like, at first,
I try to win people over

20:35.230 --> 20:36.630
with my wit and charm,

20:36.630 --> 20:39.470
and then I try to use my hands
to impress them.

20:39.470 --> 20:40.470
[laughs]

20:40.470 --> 20:42.170
Then I discovered videography,

20:42.170 --> 20:44.599
something that
I absolutely love.

20:44.599 --> 20:47.569
I didn't see the connection
between filmmaking and magic.

20:47.569 --> 20:49.900
They organically happened
to come together.

20:49.900 --> 20:52.500
I was constantly thinking about
how I wanted to shoot this

20:52.500 --> 20:54.269
and how I wanted to bring
a new perspective

20:54.269 --> 20:55.769
over here with the camera.

20:55.769 --> 20:57.099
And then, at the end of it,

20:57.099 --> 20:59.170
oh, by the way, there's
a really cool magic visual.

20:59.170 --> 21:00.400
[squish and tear]

21:00.400 --> 21:03.029
- [groaning softly]

21:03.029 --> 21:05.869
[cheers and applause]

21:05.869 --> 21:08.329
- Our next magician
is from Canada,

21:08.329 --> 21:10.730
and he's "aboot"
to blow your mind.

21:10.730 --> 21:13.329
Please welcome Ryan Joyce.

21:13.329 --> 21:16.329
[cheers and applause]

21:17.569 --> 21:20.569
[dramatic orchestral music]

21:20.569 --> 21:28.569
â™ª â™ª

21:48.529 --> 21:56.529
â™ª â™ª

22:09.369 --> 22:12.369
[tense orchestral music]

22:12.369 --> 22:20.369
â™ª â™ª

22:36.599 --> 22:39.599
[dramatic orchestral music]

22:39.599 --> 22:47.599
â™ª â™ª

23:03.500 --> 23:06.500
[cheers and applause]

23:06.500 --> 23:14.000
â™ª â™ª

23:14.000 --> 23:17.000
[tense orchestral music]

23:17.000 --> 23:25.000
â™ª â™ª

23:41.599 --> 23:44.599
[dramatic orchestral music]

23:44.599 --> 23:52.599
â™ª â™ª

24:02.329 --> 24:04.970
[cheers and applause]

24:04.970 --> 24:06.299
- Yeah!

24:06.299 --> 24:10.529
[cheers and applause]

24:10.529 --> 24:13.930
- Wow!

24:13.930 --> 24:17.329
That was amazing.

24:17.329 --> 24:19.099
That was incredible.
- Right. Thank you.

24:19.099 --> 24:20.369
Thank you very much.

24:20.369 --> 24:22.569
I've always wanted
a magician-sized hamster wheel.

24:22.569 --> 24:24.500
- Well, I would say so.

24:24.500 --> 24:26.869
But how big are
the hamsters in Canada?

24:26.869 --> 24:28.769
- [laughs]
- Jeez.

24:28.769 --> 24:30.329
- Too big.
- Yeah.

24:30.329 --> 24:33.000
- So you haven't done this
for six years, you said?

24:33.000 --> 24:35.769
- Yeah, we--I stopped doing
the big illusion tour,

24:35.769 --> 24:38.269
and this is the first time
we've done this in six years,

24:38.269 --> 24:39.730
together on this very stage.

24:39.730 --> 24:41.029
So it's an honor.

24:41.029 --> 24:43.430
- So is this a reunion
for you and your assistant?

24:43.430 --> 24:45.369
- It is; we haven't been
together in six years.

24:45.369 --> 24:47.029
So it's--and she's so talented.

24:47.029 --> 24:48.369
And I think you'll agree.
She's--

24:48.369 --> 24:50.099
- Yes, amazing.

24:50.099 --> 24:51.500
[applause]

24:51.500 --> 24:54.670
So, like, when you're
not using this,

24:54.670 --> 24:57.000
do you use it, like,
as a TV stand, or something?

24:57.000 --> 24:58.200
- Yeah, it sits
in the kitchen.

24:58.200 --> 24:59.470
- Oh, right, right.

24:59.470 --> 25:01.470
And you do a lot of work
for charity as well, right?

25:01.470 --> 25:02.930
- Yeah, well, we do it
for children's groups

25:02.930 --> 25:05.099
and firefighters and police
organizations, all that.

25:05.099 --> 25:07.829
So we've raised over $2 million
for charities across Canada.

25:07.829 --> 25:09.029
- That's amazing.
[applause]

25:09.029 --> 25:10.329
That's so cool.

25:10.329 --> 25:11.769
I love that.

25:11.769 --> 25:12.930
That's amazing.

25:12.930 --> 25:15.569
And then I also hear
that people say

25:15.569 --> 25:17.000
that you look
like Kevin Bacon.

25:17.000 --> 25:19.200
- Oh, yeah,
I travel on ships

25:19.200 --> 25:20.529
all the time,
cruise ships now.

25:20.529 --> 25:22.200
And everyone says
I look like Kevin Bacon,

25:22.200 --> 25:23.769
which would make me
Canadian Bacon.

25:23.769 --> 25:26.599
- Yes, oh, perfect.
- Yeah.

25:26.599 --> 25:28.529
- All right, well, I think
we've given them

25:28.529 --> 25:30.670
enough time to talk
amongst themselves.

25:30.670 --> 25:33.099
So let's see whether
or not you fooled them.

25:33.099 --> 25:34.099
Gentlemen?

25:34.099 --> 25:35.470
- Boy, this is a good trick.

25:35.470 --> 25:37.670
And this uses
a couple of principles

25:37.670 --> 25:40.369
that I don't think
we've seen put together before.

25:40.369 --> 25:41.970
I want to say this
a little bit carefully,

25:41.970 --> 25:43.170
but I'm not gonna use
any code.

25:43.170 --> 25:44.470
I'm just gonna
say it outright.

25:44.470 --> 25:45.700
Light doesn't always come

25:45.700 --> 25:47.400
from where you think
it's coming from.

25:47.400 --> 25:50.069
There's assumptions that we make
as audience members

25:50.069 --> 25:52.130
about where things are
and how they run.

25:52.130 --> 25:57.200
And the assumption is so strong
and so true and so visceral

25:57.200 --> 25:59.569
that, even though we knew it,

25:59.569 --> 26:02.029
you can't get your monkey brain
to see it wrong.

26:02.029 --> 26:03.369
- Right, right.
- It's wonderful.

26:03.369 --> 26:05.970
Another thing that gave us
a little bit of a hint,

26:05.970 --> 26:08.130
that Teller will
elaborate on more,

26:08.130 --> 26:10.170
is the footwear, you know?

26:10.170 --> 26:12.400
The combination
of one of the assistants

26:12.400 --> 26:13.869
wearing big clunky boots

26:13.869 --> 26:16.900
and the other assistant
being barefoot and being small

26:16.900 --> 26:19.069
helped it so that
we could have this.

26:19.069 --> 26:21.500
And Teller's gonna show you
a little piece of art.

26:21.500 --> 26:25.170
You know, Teller does
wonderful drawings.

26:25.170 --> 26:26.470
It's a piece of art
right here,

26:26.470 --> 26:27.599
which you won't look at.

26:27.599 --> 26:28.930
We're just gonna
look at this.

26:28.930 --> 26:30.500
This is nice tissue paper
over here, isn't it?

26:30.500 --> 26:32.269
- Wait, you said you weren't
talking in code?

26:32.269 --> 26:33.970
[both speaking indistinctly]
- No, no, we were.

26:33.970 --> 26:35.700
Straight out,
we let it straight out.

26:35.700 --> 26:36.869
But you see right here.

26:36.869 --> 26:38.329
Now Teller's gonna
sign this for you.

26:38.329 --> 26:39.829
- Yes, sir.
- Wonderfully done, man.

26:39.829 --> 26:41.569
Thanks so much.
- All right.

26:41.569 --> 26:43.069
So you're clear
that they didn't--

26:43.069 --> 26:44.529
- Absolutely.
- They were not fooled.

26:44.529 --> 26:45.930
And they weren't talking
in code,

26:45.930 --> 26:47.500
but I have no idea
what they were saying.

26:47.500 --> 26:48.569
[laughter]

26:48.569 --> 26:49.569
All right.
- Thank you.

26:49.569 --> 26:50.569
- Ladies and gentlemen,

26:50.569 --> 26:52.769
let's hear it for Ryan Joyce.

26:52.769 --> 26:54.099
Thank you.

26:54.099 --> 26:55.130
[cheers and applause]

26:55.130 --> 26:56.630
All right.

26:56.630 --> 27:00.730
[cheers and applause]

27:00.730 --> 27:02.470
More "Fool Us" on the way,

27:02.470 --> 27:05.029
including something
from the legends themselves,

27:05.029 --> 27:06.200
Penn and Teller.

27:06.200 --> 27:07.730
Stick around.

27:07.730 --> 27:10.730
[jazz music]

27:10.730 --> 27:13.130
[cheers and applause]

27:17.569 --> 27:20.900
[jazz music]

27:20.900 --> 27:23.900
[cheers and applause]

27:25.869 --> 27:28.529
- Welcome back
to "Penn & Teller: Fool Us,"

27:28.529 --> 27:31.299
where you get the most
magic bang for your buck.

27:31.299 --> 27:33.529
Now let's meet
our next magician.

27:36.130 --> 27:38.700
- Kyle was anxious
about doing this interview,

27:38.700 --> 27:41.799
so he asked me, his therapist,
to do it instead.

27:41.799 --> 27:44.299
[light instrumental music]

27:44.299 --> 27:45.970
The best way to describe Kyle

27:45.970 --> 27:48.970
is that he's someone who
learned all his social skills

27:48.970 --> 27:50.900
from books written by people

27:50.900 --> 27:54.670
who learned all
their social skills from books.

27:54.670 --> 27:57.529
Kyle's been performing magic
since the age of ten.

27:57.529 --> 27:59.230
[woman vocalizing]

27:59.230 --> 28:01.000
Kyle does magic because he has

28:01.000 --> 28:03.599
a latent and persistent
compulsion to lie.

28:03.599 --> 28:06.930
â™ª â™ª

28:06.930 --> 28:09.569
To help Kyle overcome
stage fright,

28:09.569 --> 28:11.900
we intend
to build him up gradually.

28:11.900 --> 28:15.200
First, he'll perform
for inanimate objects,

28:15.200 --> 28:18.930
then fish...

28:18.930 --> 28:21.599
then parrots...

28:21.599 --> 28:23.970
then flamingos,

28:23.970 --> 28:25.630
and then, finally, asbestos.

28:25.630 --> 28:29.200
I think that Kyle will be able
to perform for Penn and Teller.

28:29.200 --> 28:30.700
The therapy has never failed,

28:30.700 --> 28:33.599
and I have no doubt
that he will flourish.

28:33.599 --> 28:35.230
Well, thank you
for the interview.

28:35.230 --> 28:36.930
And I wish him
the best tomorrow.

28:36.930 --> 28:38.400
Good night.

28:38.400 --> 28:41.400
[whimsical music]

28:41.400 --> 28:44.329
â™ª â™ª

28:44.329 --> 28:45.900
- Who was that?

28:45.900 --> 28:49.069
[cheers and applause]

28:49.069 --> 28:51.630
- As his bio states,
our next act

28:51.630 --> 28:54.130
emerged from his mother
23 years ago

28:54.130 --> 28:56.730
covered in amniotic fluid.

28:56.730 --> 28:59.829
Well, I can't think of a more
beautiful introduction myself,

28:59.829 --> 29:03.029
so please welcome the young
and recently showered

29:03.029 --> 29:04.829
Kyle Eschen.

29:04.829 --> 29:07.829
[cheers and applause]

29:12.799 --> 29:15.269
[laughter]
- Whoo!

29:15.269 --> 29:17.529
- So, obviously,
I'm a magician.

29:17.529 --> 29:20.329
I think that's the third best
thing about me,

29:20.329 --> 29:22.500
the second being my hygiene,

29:22.500 --> 29:25.799
the first being the fact
that I'm not an arsonist.

29:25.799 --> 29:27.930
[laughter]

29:27.930 --> 29:30.630
I got my start
at children's birthday parties.

29:30.630 --> 29:31.970
I'd say clever things like,

29:31.970 --> 29:34.930
"Hey, kids, which hand
holds the shrimp?

29:34.930 --> 29:37.670
Wrong, you're all
flawed human beings."

29:37.670 --> 29:40.930
[laughter]

29:40.930 --> 29:42.200
They all loved me,

29:42.200 --> 29:45.470
though not everyone has been
so enamored with my act.

29:45.470 --> 29:47.500
For instance--
and this is a true story--

29:47.500 --> 29:50.269
after one show, a woman
walked up to me and said,

29:50.269 --> 29:52.829
"You're rather
socially awkward onstage.

29:52.829 --> 29:54.630
Do you have Asperger's?"

29:54.630 --> 29:57.700
And I thought that was
a strange question to ask,

29:57.700 --> 30:00.200
because that's usually
my pick-up line.

30:00.200 --> 30:04.369
[laughter]

30:04.369 --> 30:07.799
Now that the persona
has been established,

30:07.799 --> 30:10.930
we can proceed with
a rather disappointing miracle

30:10.930 --> 30:13.769
that requires the assistance
of a member of the audience.

30:13.769 --> 30:16.470
If you, sir, wouldn't mind
joining me onstage.

30:16.470 --> 30:17.930
Let's have a round of applause
for him

30:17.930 --> 30:19.569
as he makes his way up.

30:19.569 --> 30:21.500
[cheers and applause]

30:21.500 --> 30:23.029
Thank you very much
for coming up here.

30:23.029 --> 30:24.630
If you wouldn't mind
just standing here.

30:24.630 --> 30:26.400
No one likes to be summoned
from the crowd

30:26.400 --> 30:29.000
to assist a magician,
so I do appreciate it.

30:29.000 --> 30:31.869
This trick requires
a very special prop,

30:31.869 --> 30:35.000
which I keep
in a very special place.

30:39.630 --> 30:41.069
My pocket.

30:41.069 --> 30:44.599
[laughter]

30:44.599 --> 30:45.900
Now, I know
you were expecting me

30:45.900 --> 30:47.369
to pull something
out of your ear.

30:47.369 --> 30:48.799
But, in fact,
I did the opposite.

30:48.799 --> 30:50.430
I put something in.

30:50.430 --> 30:52.630
You'll discover it
in about a week's time.

30:52.630 --> 30:55.000
[laughter]

30:55.000 --> 30:56.430
When it hatches.

30:56.430 --> 30:58.400
[laughter]

30:58.400 --> 30:59.900
Magicians are terrible
at dating,

30:59.900 --> 31:03.069
so we need some mechanism
by which to pass on our genes.

31:03.069 --> 31:04.099
[laughter]

31:04.099 --> 31:06.099
Who knew that
magicians reproduced

31:06.099 --> 31:09.529
in the same manner
as the African bot fly?

31:09.529 --> 31:11.670
The real secrets of magic
revealed.

31:11.670 --> 31:12.930
[laughter]

31:12.930 --> 31:15.200
We have here a rather unusual
deck of cards,

31:15.200 --> 31:17.500
blank but for a list
of my favorite things.

31:17.500 --> 31:19.170
I'll rattle some of them off.

31:19.170 --> 31:22.130
We have here waffles, beans,

31:22.130 --> 31:25.000
liver, lint, wood chips,

31:25.000 --> 31:27.329
doorknobs, bleach, pollen--

31:27.329 --> 31:29.200
the usual suspects.

31:29.200 --> 31:31.500
The important point
is that they are all distinct.

31:31.500 --> 31:33.869
There are no duplicates
among them.

31:33.869 --> 31:37.099
I actually have a compelling
theatrical motivation

31:37.099 --> 31:38.569
for having these,

31:38.569 --> 31:41.700
but I'm gonna skip that,
because nobody cares.

31:41.700 --> 31:44.069
[laughter]

31:44.069 --> 31:46.599
We require one of these cards
to be picked,

31:46.599 --> 31:47.900
one item to be picked.

31:47.900 --> 31:50.170
So as I run my thumb
down the side of the deck,

31:50.170 --> 31:51.569
please just say, "Stop,"
anytime.

31:51.569 --> 31:52.569
- Stop.

31:52.569 --> 31:53.700
- Here?
- Yep.

31:53.700 --> 31:55.400
- Please hold out your palm,
up.

31:55.400 --> 31:57.329
I will deal you that card.

31:57.329 --> 31:59.099
And please cup
your other hand beneath,

31:59.099 --> 32:00.829
as if holding water,

32:00.829 --> 32:02.769
or perhaps bile,

32:02.769 --> 32:04.799
my favorite emulsifier,

32:04.799 --> 32:06.730
though I don't think
I'm alone in that.

32:06.730 --> 32:09.869
[laughter]

32:09.869 --> 32:12.099
Notice, by the way,
I say "water,"

32:12.099 --> 32:13.670
he cups his hand one way,

32:13.670 --> 32:17.299
or "bile," there's a slight
shift in posture.

32:17.299 --> 32:18.930
Say what you will
about this guy,

32:18.930 --> 32:21.430
but this is a man
who understands fluid dynamics.

32:21.430 --> 32:23.130
[laughter]

32:23.130 --> 32:26.630
And that is the most important
quality a human being can have.

32:26.630 --> 32:29.269
So I just want you
to know that.

32:29.269 --> 32:30.799
We have here
a silk handkerchief,

32:30.799 --> 32:32.630
the last remaining prop.

32:32.630 --> 32:37.099
And I will nonverbally display
the fact that it is empty

32:37.099 --> 32:39.630
by flinging it several times
toward the gentleman.

32:42.670 --> 32:44.900
Now that I've
established dominance...

32:44.900 --> 32:48.869
[laughter]

32:48.869 --> 32:52.630
I will reveal the name
of the item selected.

32:52.630 --> 32:54.900
And you might not be able
to tell this at home,

32:54.900 --> 32:57.599
but the mood in this theater
is tense.

32:57.599 --> 32:59.500
[laughter]

33:01.400 --> 33:03.400
Lentils.

33:03.400 --> 33:05.269
You picked lentils.

33:05.269 --> 33:06.670
Now, earlier, I warned

33:06.670 --> 33:09.400
that this was gonna be
a disappointing trick,

33:09.400 --> 33:12.700
but even I could not
anticipate the extent.

33:12.700 --> 33:14.130
Please keep
your hands cupped, sir,

33:14.130 --> 33:17.029
and rivet your attention
to the handkerchiefs.

33:17.029 --> 33:19.069
Watch, as cascading forth,

33:19.069 --> 33:21.599
we find the birth of lentils,

33:21.599 --> 33:24.200
lentils by the billions,
screaming forward.

33:24.200 --> 33:27.470
You may keep this as a token
of gratitude for coming up here.

33:27.470 --> 33:29.000
Thank you very much
for your help, sir.

33:29.000 --> 33:30.299
You can go back to your seat.

33:30.299 --> 33:31.500
My name is Kyle Eschen.
- Whoo!

33:31.500 --> 33:33.430
- Thank you
for your attention.

33:33.430 --> 33:34.670
[cheers and applause]

33:34.670 --> 33:36.900
- Oh, wow.

33:36.900 --> 33:40.269
Well, I'm certainly glad
he didn't pick liver.

33:40.269 --> 33:43.230
That would have been gross.

33:43.230 --> 33:46.029
Hi, so, you won't be upset
if I don't call you

33:46.029 --> 33:48.400
for my daughter's
birthday party, right?

33:48.400 --> 33:49.930
- I will not.
- Okay, good.

33:49.930 --> 33:51.269
[laughter]

33:51.269 --> 33:53.730
You seem like
a happy guy, huh?

33:53.730 --> 33:54.900
- Uh, ecstatic.

33:54.900 --> 33:56.769
- Yeah, I can tell.

33:56.769 --> 33:58.970
And what actually
brought you into magic?

33:58.970 --> 34:02.200
Like, when did you decide
that's what you wanted to do?

34:02.200 --> 34:04.670
- A family friend
showed me a card trick,

34:04.670 --> 34:06.430
and he would not tell me
how it was done,

34:06.430 --> 34:08.369
so in retaliation,

34:08.369 --> 34:10.630
I spent 13 years
learning the craft.

34:10.630 --> 34:12.369
[laughter]

34:12.369 --> 34:14.199
- That's commitment.

34:14.199 --> 34:17.530
Is th--is this, like,
your character,

34:17.530 --> 34:19.530
or is this who you are?

34:19.530 --> 34:22.268
- Uh, I tone down
the awkwardness for the stage.

34:22.268 --> 34:24.429
- Gotcha, good.
That's good to know.

34:24.429 --> 34:25.699
- Right.
- All right, cool.

34:25.699 --> 34:27.469
One last thing before
we go to the guys.

34:27.469 --> 34:28.500
- Yes.

34:28.500 --> 34:29.768
- Do you have any recipes,

34:29.768 --> 34:33.099
um, that you can do
with the lentils?

34:33.099 --> 34:35.599
- I eat lentils dry.
- Oh.

34:35.599 --> 34:39.500
- Although they're good seasoned
with a little bit of saline.

34:39.500 --> 34:41.900
- Oh, well,
let's go to the guys.

34:41.900 --> 34:43.869
Gentlemen?

34:43.869 --> 34:46.400
- Uh, we love you.

34:46.400 --> 34:47.800
- Thank you.

34:47.800 --> 34:50.099
[cheers and applause]

34:50.099 --> 34:53.170
- We'll be, uh...

34:53.170 --> 34:55.469
And we are gonna be
seeing you everywhere

34:55.469 --> 34:56.699
for the rest of our lives.

34:56.699 --> 34:59.269
Uh, you're gonna do--

34:59.269 --> 35:01.769
you are gonna be a force
to be reckoned with.

35:01.769 --> 35:03.230
There's no doubt
about that.

35:03.230 --> 35:07.769
I really don't want to talk
at all about the magic,

35:07.769 --> 35:09.070
although I love the fact--

35:09.070 --> 35:11.230
this will serve you very well
for the rest of your life--

35:11.230 --> 35:13.730
that you are able to stand
with your hands

35:13.730 --> 35:15.269
as though you
were palming something

35:15.269 --> 35:17.500
even when you're not
palming something.

35:17.500 --> 35:18.730
It's very natural for you.

35:18.730 --> 35:20.329
That will be
very, very useful.

35:20.329 --> 35:23.400
But I want to say that, um,

35:23.400 --> 35:26.070
you did something
truly impossible

35:26.070 --> 35:27.869
and truly amazing here.

35:27.869 --> 35:31.400
The best thing we can
say about you is,

35:31.400 --> 35:32.630
you are doing something

35:32.630 --> 35:35.230
that many, many
magicians try to do

35:35.230 --> 35:37.500
and very few pull off,

35:37.500 --> 35:41.099
and that is, whether you
fooled anybody or not,

35:41.099 --> 35:43.230
you are funny.

35:43.230 --> 35:44.400
- Mm-hmm.
- Thank you.

35:44.400 --> 35:45.469
[cheers and applause]

35:45.469 --> 35:47.230
- Very true.

35:47.230 --> 35:49.400
- Really funny.

35:49.400 --> 35:50.900
- So, obviously,

35:50.900 --> 35:54.030
that compliment is better
than any trophy, right?

35:54.030 --> 35:55.429
I mean--
- That is true.

35:55.429 --> 35:57.199
- All right.
- It's a worthwhile trade-off.

35:57.199 --> 35:59.269
- Right, but you know that
you probably didn't fool them.

35:59.269 --> 36:01.429
- Not at all.
- But that they might

36:01.429 --> 36:03.329
become a trio with you.

36:03.329 --> 36:04.400
No? Maybe?

36:04.400 --> 36:05.699
- You're just so funny,
so great.

36:05.699 --> 36:07.170
- Yes, you are so amazing,

36:07.170 --> 36:08.730
so wonderfully amusing,

36:08.730 --> 36:10.230
and, uh, slightly scary.

36:10.230 --> 36:11.329
But we love you.
[laughter]

36:11.329 --> 36:12.469
Okay.

36:12.469 --> 36:15.099
So thank you, Kyle Eschen.
- Thank you.

36:15.099 --> 36:18.230
[cheers and applause]
- All right.

36:18.230 --> 36:20.699
- [laughs]

36:20.699 --> 36:23.030
- Don't go anywhere,
because when we come back,

36:23.030 --> 36:25.730
we'll see Penn and Teller
in action.

36:25.730 --> 36:28.269
[jazz music]

36:28.269 --> 36:31.269
[cheers and applause]

36:35.670 --> 36:37.570
[jazz music]

36:37.570 --> 36:40.570
[cheers and applause]

36:43.800 --> 36:47.099
- Tonight we close our show
with something special.

36:47.099 --> 36:49.070
Here to do a trick
with Penn and Teller

36:49.070 --> 36:50.469
is a mega movie star

36:50.469 --> 36:53.070
who's playing the world's
greatest magician

36:53.070 --> 36:56.400
in the summer blockbuster
"Now You See Me 2."

36:56.400 --> 37:00.570
Ladies and gentlemen, Penn,
Teller, and Jesse Eisenberg.

37:00.570 --> 37:02.170
[cheers and applause]
- Oh, thank you.

37:02.170 --> 37:03.730
- Jesse.

37:03.730 --> 37:04.929
And you stay right here.

37:04.929 --> 37:06.329
- Ooh, yay.

37:06.329 --> 37:07.829
- And you're
a little bit mistaken.

37:07.829 --> 37:09.070
We're not doing
a trick with him.

37:09.070 --> 37:10.300
We're each gonna do
a trick for you.

37:10.300 --> 37:11.300
- Oh.

37:11.300 --> 37:12.400
- Each one of us
is gonna do a trick.

37:12.400 --> 37:14.199
There's no one-upmanship
involved.

37:14.199 --> 37:16.300
This is just us all
just doing a trick.

37:16.300 --> 37:18.530
I've got a deck of cards here.

37:18.530 --> 37:19.769
We'll all share this deck,

37:19.769 --> 37:21.199
and I'll give them
a little shuffle.

37:21.199 --> 37:22.730
And I'm gonna go first,
if that's okay.

37:22.730 --> 37:23.800
Is that okay?

37:23.800 --> 37:25.300
Just say, "Stop,"
whenever you want.

37:25.300 --> 37:26.829
- Stop.
- Right about halfway through.

37:26.829 --> 37:27.829
- Take a look at that card.

37:27.829 --> 37:28.829
Look at it.

37:28.829 --> 37:29.829
Focus on it.

37:29.829 --> 37:30.969
Concentrate on it.

37:30.969 --> 37:32.070
- Okay.

37:32.070 --> 37:33.469
- Get it clear in your head.
- Yes.

37:33.469 --> 37:36.300
- See if I can figure out
what your card is.

37:36.300 --> 37:37.630
It's going into my head.

37:37.630 --> 37:39.769
It's going down my neck.

37:39.769 --> 37:43.369
And is that your card?

37:43.369 --> 37:45.329
- Yeah, it's queen of spades.

37:45.329 --> 37:46.800
- Queen of spades.
- Yes.

37:46.800 --> 37:48.630
- The queen of spades.

37:48.630 --> 37:51.530
The queen of spades,
and there it is right here.

37:51.530 --> 37:53.300
Teller, take it away.

37:53.300 --> 37:56.329
Now, Teller wants you
to just name a number

37:56.329 --> 37:59.900
between, like, 5 and 15,
a number that you like there.

37:59.900 --> 38:01.400
- 9.
- 9.

38:01.400 --> 38:02.900
Gonna count off nine cards.

38:02.900 --> 38:05.800
One, two, three, four,

38:05.800 --> 38:10.070
five, six, seven,
eight, nine.

38:10.070 --> 38:11.070
Now look at that card.

38:11.070 --> 38:12.130
- Yes.

38:12.130 --> 38:13.500
- Get that card
clear in your head.

38:13.500 --> 38:15.000
- I've got it.

38:15.000 --> 38:17.400
- Teller's gonna make that card
magically appear on his body.

38:17.400 --> 38:19.269
Watch this, Alyson.

38:19.269 --> 38:20.829
You know what
the card is, right?

38:20.829 --> 38:21.969
- Yes.

38:21.969 --> 38:24.929
- And is that your card,
the five of hearts?

38:24.929 --> 38:26.599
- No.
[light laughter]

38:26.599 --> 38:28.530
- Oh.

38:28.530 --> 38:31.500
Well, I guess I do the better
trick than he did, didn't I?

38:31.500 --> 38:32.599
Not the five of hearts.
- No.

38:32.599 --> 38:34.699
- Maybe it's
the seven of hearts?

38:34.699 --> 38:35.699
- Ah, no.

38:35.699 --> 38:37.670
- Is it the nine--oh.

38:37.670 --> 38:38.670
- Yes.

38:38.670 --> 38:39.670
- The ten of hearts.

38:39.670 --> 38:40.969
That's your card?
- Yeah.

38:40.969 --> 38:42.369
- The ten of hearts?
- [laughs]

38:42.369 --> 38:45.070
Aw.
- Okay, mega movie star.

38:45.070 --> 38:46.070
- Yes, yes.

38:46.070 --> 38:47.500
- Give it a shot.
- Okay, thanks.

38:47.500 --> 38:48.869
- Jesse Eisenberg,

38:48.869 --> 38:50.900
movie star,
doing a card trick.

38:50.900 --> 38:52.429
- I know there's
no one-upmanship,

38:52.429 --> 38:54.199
but can I outdo you?

38:54.199 --> 38:55.929
- Oh.
- Is that okay?

38:55.929 --> 38:57.199
- Give it a shot, sure.

38:57.199 --> 38:58.469
- Okay, thank you, thank you,
thank you, okay.

38:58.469 --> 38:59.699
Okay, so choose any card.

38:59.699 --> 39:00.900
- Okay.
- Except that one.

39:00.900 --> 39:02.130
- No, it's okay.
You can choose that one.

39:02.130 --> 39:03.130
both: Okay.

39:03.130 --> 39:04.230
- All right.
- Okay.

39:04.230 --> 39:05.630
Do you feel confident
in that card?

39:05.630 --> 39:07.199
- I hope so.
- Okay, 'cause I don't.

39:07.199 --> 39:08.369
Okay, you hold that,

39:08.369 --> 39:09.969
because I can only do
one thing at a time.

39:09.969 --> 39:12.000
Okay, now show the audience
here that card.

39:12.000 --> 39:13.670
- Okay.
- And don't tell me what it is.

39:13.670 --> 39:15.170
- Okay.

39:15.170 --> 39:17.469
- Okay, now you can tell me
what that card was.

39:17.469 --> 39:19.199
- Okay, seven of diamonds.

39:19.199 --> 39:20.929
- Seven of diamonds.
- Yes.

39:20.929 --> 39:21.969
- Okay, yeah.

39:21.969 --> 39:23.670
Okay, I have
the seven of diamonds

39:23.670 --> 39:25.429
actually tattooed
on me as well, yes.

39:25.429 --> 39:27.230
- [gasps] Oh, my God.
- Yes.

39:27.230 --> 39:28.599
Isn't that incredible?

39:28.599 --> 39:30.429
- That is incredible.
- Yeah.

39:30.429 --> 39:31.900
- Did really good.
- Thank you so much.

39:31.900 --> 39:33.130
So...
- Wow.

39:33.130 --> 39:35.099
- [speaks indistinctly]
- Did I win the show?

39:35.099 --> 39:37.769
- In "Now You See Me 2,"
you play a magician.

39:37.769 --> 39:39.199
- Yes, and now I--
- Wonderful actor.

39:39.199 --> 39:41.130
- And now I could do that...
- He's a great actor.

39:41.130 --> 39:42.869
- And now I could do magic,
like, perfectly.

39:42.869 --> 39:44.199
- Well, you do magic--

39:44.199 --> 39:47.429
You're an actor who plays
a magician in a movie.

39:47.429 --> 39:48.730
- And now I won
your TV show.

39:48.730 --> 39:50.400
That's amazing.
Thank you so much.

39:50.400 --> 39:51.570
- Well, uh--
- Yeah.

39:51.570 --> 39:52.900
- No, we brought you on
because--

39:52.900 --> 39:54.230
- 'Cause it's not even,
like, my main thing,

39:54.230 --> 39:55.329
and, like, I won it.

39:55.329 --> 39:56.630
- It's not your main thing,
but--

39:56.630 --> 39:58.130
- And it's such an honor
to now win.

39:58.130 --> 39:59.570
- No, well, you didn't
actually win.

39:59.570 --> 40:01.730
You were out here
as a mega movie star.

40:01.730 --> 40:02.929
You weren't out here to--

40:02.929 --> 40:05.400
- Yes, who then transcended that
and now won.

40:05.400 --> 40:07.199
[laughter]
- Hmm.

40:07.199 --> 40:10.130
- We--I think we have
a pretty good idea

40:10.130 --> 40:11.429
how you did that trick.

40:11.429 --> 40:13.500
- What? How?
- Well, I'm not gonna say it.

40:13.500 --> 40:15.230
- Well, no, tell me.
How did I do it?

40:15.230 --> 40:19.099
I had a tattoo of her exact card
on my ankle area.

40:19.099 --> 40:20.630
- Yes, you did,
and we think--

40:20.630 --> 40:21.869
- You fooled me.

40:21.869 --> 40:23.099
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

40:23.099 --> 40:25.099
- It's possible--
- But, yeah, thank you.

40:25.099 --> 40:28.230
- It's possible
that you have, uh--

40:28.230 --> 40:29.500
how do I say this polite?

40:29.500 --> 40:32.130
More than one tattoo
on your body.

40:32.130 --> 40:35.769
Maybe you have 52 tattoos
on your body.

40:35.769 --> 40:37.469
- Oh, oh, I see, right, right.
No, so you think, like, she said

40:37.469 --> 40:39.730
the seven of diamonds, and I
remembered that it was there?

40:39.730 --> 40:41.199
- Seven of diamonds, yeah.
- Yeah.

40:41.199 --> 40:42.630
No, that would be,
like, a really clever--

40:42.630 --> 40:43.929
- And you could maybe
open your chest.

40:43.929 --> 40:45.269
You could roll up your sleeve.

40:45.269 --> 40:46.570
You might have other--

40:46.570 --> 40:48.969
- Yeah, 'cause, no, I actually
do have 52 cards

40:48.969 --> 40:50.070
tattooed on my body.

40:50.070 --> 40:51.300
- Okay,
so you didn't fool us.

40:51.300 --> 40:54.699
- But, actually,
they're all the same.

40:54.699 --> 40:56.570
They're all the same.

40:56.570 --> 40:58.000
They're all the seven
of diamonds.

40:58.000 --> 40:59.900
- Ohh.
- Yeah, no, actually, I do.

40:59.900 --> 41:03.099
I do; actually I have them
all over my body.

41:03.099 --> 41:04.769
Yeah, this one,
I actually got--

41:04.769 --> 41:06.030
This one, I got at camp.

41:06.030 --> 41:07.969
It was like a hazing ritual.

41:07.969 --> 41:11.000
This one, actually
my mother tattooed on me.

41:11.000 --> 41:13.170
Actually, I have one here, yes.

41:13.170 --> 41:15.929
This one, I actually got
on my 18th birthday.

41:15.929 --> 41:17.900
Yes, kind of a gift.

41:17.900 --> 41:19.429
Yes, actually, I got one here.

41:19.429 --> 41:20.929
- Oh, yeah.
- I got one there.

41:20.929 --> 41:22.400
- Ooh.
- I got one here.

41:22.400 --> 41:24.170
This, one, this one's
actually a birthmark,

41:24.170 --> 41:25.570
but the rest are all tattoos.

41:25.570 --> 41:26.869
[laughter]
Yeah.

41:26.869 --> 41:29.429
- Okay, so you're
a real magician too, Jesse.

41:29.429 --> 41:30.969
Nicely done.
- Thank you so much.

41:30.969 --> 41:32.469
- Jesse Eisenberg!
[cheers and applause]

41:32.469 --> 41:34.730
"Now You See Me 2"!

41:34.730 --> 41:37.400
Movie star
and great magician.

41:37.400 --> 41:39.530
- Jesse Eisenberg.
[cheers and applause]

41:39.530 --> 41:44.030
Come back next week for more
"Penn & Teller: Fool Us."

41:44.030 --> 41:46.030
[jazz music]

41:46.030 --> 41:48.199
[cheers and applause]

41:48.199 --> 41:49.670
[indistinct chatter]
