WEBVTT

00:00.010 --> 00:01.630
You need to go to the Inspector.

00:01.680 --> 00:03.430
First, we track these men down.

00:03.480 --> 00:05.270
Then I'll decide what to do with you.

00:05.320 --> 00:07.350
Get your hands off me!

00:07.400 --> 00:09.230
That's the ringleader.

00:09.280 --> 00:12.750
I'm going to play it by the book. No more
drinking after hours or bungs to you.

00:12.800 --> 00:15.230
Our regulars come here for
the music, not the drink.

00:15.280 --> 00:17.030
It's me that chooses
when to walk away.

00:17.080 --> 00:19.110
You were a war profiteer.

00:19.160 --> 00:22.350
~ Is that going to haunt me all my life?
~ Yes.

00:22.400 --> 00:24.470
~ What happened?
~ A man pulled her by the arm.

00:24.520 --> 00:26.230
~ Did she not tell you?
~ No.

00:26.280 --> 00:29.150
You shouldn't have said anything.
Keep out of my marriage.

00:29.200 --> 00:31.990
You're not regretting it,
are you? Us being married.

00:32.040 --> 00:34.590
I don't know. I don't
know anything any more.

00:34.640 --> 00:37.070
We're parasites, living off dreams.

00:37.120 --> 00:39.470
A huge hotel bill for her.

00:39.520 --> 00:42.190
We shouldn't. We really shouldn't.

00:44.000 --> 00:50.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:23.600 --> 01:27.590
~ I'm sorry that I have to go.
~ No, I understand. The time flies.

01:27.640 --> 01:30.430
I know we had all night, but
all I can think about is:

01:30.480 --> 01:33.020
when are we going to kiss again?

01:33.880 --> 01:35.880
Now.

01:56.520 --> 01:59.350
Mr Selfridge, have you had any
more trouble from servicemen,

01:59.400 --> 02:01.070
after that shop girl was attacked?

02:01.120 --> 02:03.670
There's no story. You're
wasting your time.

02:03.720 --> 02:06.840
Well, I was wondering how you're
feeling about that, sir...

02:21.640 --> 02:24.910
As you all probably know, we
need two new staff members.

02:24.960 --> 02:28.910
Now, I'll be looking outside the
store for the Head of Display,

02:28.960 --> 02:33.430
but I'd like to find our next
Store Deputy right here.

02:33.480 --> 02:36.350
The successful applicant will
keep their current post,

02:36.400 --> 02:38.510
but will take on extra duties.

02:38.560 --> 02:40.590
And extra pay.

02:40.640 --> 02:45.320
So, if you'd like to throw your hat in
the ring, now is the time. Act fast.

02:45.840 --> 02:47.950
Oh, one more thing.

02:48.000 --> 02:51.710
Mrs Edwards is returning
after her recent misfortune.

02:51.760 --> 02:54.070
We're very glad you're back.

02:54.120 --> 02:57.120
~ Indeed.
~ Hear, hear.
~ Thank you, Mr Selfridge.

02:58.280 --> 03:01.880
And if there's anything
you need, please just ask.

03:02.360 --> 03:04.500
Thank you all very much.

03:06.320 --> 03:08.920
Gordon... Just a moment, please.

03:15.760 --> 03:18.870
Mrs Edwards, how are you?
Such a terrible ordeal.

03:18.920 --> 03:23.110
~ Well, thank you.
~ I've kept things going whilst you were away.

03:23.160 --> 03:26.790
Summer florals should be at the
front of the perfume display,

03:26.840 --> 03:29.640
and these brushes should be in a fan.

03:29.720 --> 03:31.720
Not a wigwam.

03:32.560 --> 03:35.100
I'll deal with the rest myself.

03:35.840 --> 03:40.230
And I can understand, naturally,
you expected the Deputy position,

03:40.280 --> 03:44.280
and I thought, to be fair, that you
should apply alongside everyone else.

03:45.560 --> 03:48.400
Er... actually...

03:49.240 --> 03:51.760
I'm not sure I'm ready.

03:52.840 --> 03:56.760
I tried stepping up before -
remember? At the fashion event.

03:57.600 --> 03:59.430
You pulled me off it.
It was a disaster.

03:59.480 --> 04:01.750
~ Well, we all need to learn.
~ And I still am.

04:01.800 --> 04:04.200
It never stops - believe me.

04:04.960 --> 04:09.200
Still, Deputy's such an important
job. Your right-hand man.

04:10.600 --> 04:13.440
Maybe, in a few years' time...

04:17.000 --> 04:19.230
All right.

04:19.279 --> 04:21.750
Thank you for letting me know.

04:37.040 --> 04:40.870
So, who do you think will
go up for Store Deputy?

04:40.920 --> 04:44.220
The store is open. This
is no time to gossip.

04:45.920 --> 04:48.030
What about you?

04:48.080 --> 04:49.510
Sorry?

04:49.560 --> 04:52.360
Well, you know this place inside out.

04:52.880 --> 04:55.470
What, you mean me for
the Deputy position?

04:55.520 --> 04:57.590
You've been here years.

04:57.640 --> 04:59.510
Head of two departments.

04:59.560 --> 05:02.840
~ Well, that is completely different.
~ Is it?

05:04.560 --> 05:07.660
Well, there's no harm
in asking, is there?

05:10.240 --> 05:13.440
You have customers waiting.
Come along, now.

05:19.960 --> 05:21.670
Come.

05:25.400 --> 05:29.350
My staff report. Miss Hawkins seems
to be settling in rather well.

05:29.400 --> 05:31.710
Oh, splendid. Splendid.

05:34.760 --> 05:36.760
The job description.

05:37.000 --> 05:39.000
Thank you.

05:44.040 --> 05:46.640
Store Deputy. I'm going to apply.

05:47.040 --> 05:49.790
Funnily enough, Miss Hawkins
told me I should apply.

05:49.840 --> 05:51.790
She said I knew the store inside out.

05:51.840 --> 05:54.430
Indeed you do. Rather
more to it than that.

05:54.480 --> 05:57.150
Good knowledge of strategy.
Understanding of finance.

05:57.200 --> 05:58.590
Obviously.

05:58.640 --> 06:01.670
~ Needs someone with a
bit of backbone, stamina.
~ Yes, of course.

06:01.720 --> 06:03.390
Leader of men.

06:03.440 --> 06:06.030
I have been the head
of two departments.

06:06.080 --> 06:08.550
~ Yes.
~ Well, I've managed staff.

06:08.600 --> 06:11.230
~ Well, a few.
~ I've been in sole charge
of stocks and sales.

06:11.280 --> 06:13.670
But that's a fraction of
what passes through here.

06:13.720 --> 06:15.990
And you said yourself I'm
an asset to this store.

06:16.040 --> 06:19.430
Yes, but no woman has ever held a senior
management position in any store.

06:19.480 --> 06:22.470
I have none of the female impediments
of marriage and children,

06:22.520 --> 06:25.960
and I have an impeccable record,
Mr Grove, as well you know.

06:26.480 --> 06:29.800
~ You're not going to apply?
~ I wasn't...

06:31.040 --> 06:33.640
.. but now I rather think I will.

06:38.480 --> 06:40.480
Yes?

06:42.280 --> 06:45.440
~ Mr Selfridge, might I have a word?
~ Of course.

06:49.640 --> 06:53.340
I'd like to apply for the
position of Store Deputy.

06:58.120 --> 07:00.910
You've turned fashion
into a huge success

07:00.960 --> 07:03.390
and are very well liked
among the staff.

07:03.440 --> 07:05.390
~ Oh, really?
~ Mmm.

07:05.440 --> 07:07.150
Well, I'm very flattered.

07:07.200 --> 07:10.710
I wasn't sure if the role of Deputy
was a suitable job for a woman.

07:10.760 --> 07:13.190
Well, the world is changing,
Miss Mardle, slowly,

07:13.240 --> 07:16.950
but I can tell you the job
will go entirely on merit.

07:17.000 --> 07:20.680
Well, that's very refreshing, Mr
Selfridge. Thank you very much.

07:29.480 --> 07:33.720
Excuse me. Would you happen to know
where a Mrs Edwards works here?

07:35.200 --> 07:37.230
~ Who's asking?
~ Joe Tooby.

07:37.280 --> 07:39.820
I'm a journalist. Daily Sketch.

07:41.240 --> 07:42.750
Hmm.

07:42.800 --> 07:45.350
My sister married one of those.

07:45.400 --> 07:48.110
He hangs around the
house all day, typing.

07:48.160 --> 07:53.560
I'm probably miles out, but it wouldn't
happen to be Mr Frank Edwards, would it?

07:54.840 --> 07:56.550
So, you're her sister.

07:56.600 --> 07:58.550
Look, I'll be straight with you.

07:58.600 --> 08:02.830
Feelings about ex-servicemen are
running high, and working women.

08:02.880 --> 08:04.790
She was just walking home.

08:04.840 --> 08:08.310
The best thing you can do is get a
picture of the real Kitty out there,

08:08.360 --> 08:10.670
before people can muddy the waters.

08:10.720 --> 08:13.820
You'd be doing her a
big favour - trust me.

08:24.560 --> 08:27.350
In my opinion, there's
no better man for the job.

08:27.400 --> 08:28.830
Oh, you're very kind.

08:28.880 --> 08:32.350
One wonders, of course, what
the chief is really looking for,

08:32.400 --> 08:34.600
and who else is applying.

08:35.280 --> 08:37.429
You're not tempted?

08:37.480 --> 08:39.480
Not at my age!

08:41.000 --> 08:44.390
~ I wonder about young Mr Selfridge.
~ Gordon?

08:44.440 --> 08:48.870
He's keen, he's able, and
he's the chief's son.

08:51.040 --> 08:53.960
~ He's not going to sleep, this one.
~ Ah!

08:55.280 --> 08:57.710
~ Come here.
~ Now look!

08:57.760 --> 09:00.030
Butter wouldn't melt!

09:00.080 --> 09:02.820
Daddy's little soldier, aren't you?

09:03.520 --> 09:05.990
There's no doubt the
job would be welcome.

09:06.040 --> 09:10.110
Earn some more money, now that
we have another mouth to feed.

09:10.160 --> 09:12.320
Eh?

09:13.640 --> 09:16.840
One thing the war teaches
you - glad to be home.

09:17.840 --> 09:19.840
Where the heart is.

09:21.480 --> 09:23.480
His teether.

09:24.760 --> 09:28.190
Oh, I'm sure he doesn't
need a teether. Eh?

09:28.240 --> 09:32.280
You've got a very healthy set of
choppers in there, haven't you?

09:50.040 --> 09:52.110
~ Going out?
~ You guessed!

09:52.160 --> 09:55.510
To see Victor Colleano? If
Pa knew, he'd have a fit.

09:55.560 --> 09:57.710
So, why don't you tell him?

09:57.760 --> 09:59.830
I thought I'd talk to you first.

09:59.880 --> 10:01.630
Come off it, Gordon.

10:01.680 --> 10:04.830
You're scared I'd tell
Pa about YOUR secret love.

10:04.880 --> 10:06.990
Miss Calthorpe is just a friend.

10:07.040 --> 10:10.230
Sure (!) I saw the way
you looked at each other.

10:10.280 --> 10:12.310
~ She works at the store.
~ So what?

10:12.360 --> 10:16.830
You know, I don't care if Pa
has a fit over me and Victor,

10:16.880 --> 10:19.710
because I can stand up for myself.

10:19.760 --> 10:24.310
Is that what you're doing, when you're out
at all hours, mixing with God knows who?

10:24.360 --> 10:25.990
I'm sure it's all very exciting,

10:26.040 --> 10:28.670
but you have a reputation to
think of, and not just yours.

10:28.720 --> 10:32.200
I'd rather be shameful
than spineless.

10:46.960 --> 10:49.430
Mind yourself, son!

10:49.480 --> 10:52.070
All right, Johnny boy? Looking sharp.

10:52.120 --> 10:55.870
Bar's closing, ladies and
gentlemen. No more drinks.

10:55.920 --> 10:58.760
The bar is closed. No more drinks.

11:01.760 --> 11:05.040
No more drinks, ladies and
gentlemen. No more drinks.

11:07.800 --> 11:10.110
~ No. No!
~ What do you mean, no?

11:10.160 --> 11:11.710
One glass of champagne.

11:11.760 --> 11:14.670
But it's not just one glass.
It's not just you.

11:14.720 --> 11:17.390
All right, everybody. Listen here!

11:17.520 --> 11:19.860
No alcohol after half-nine.

11:21.240 --> 11:24.110
~ That's the law and I'm sticking to it.
~ Come on, Victor!

11:24.160 --> 11:26.790
No. No more. I've said. Wind it in.

11:26.840 --> 11:28.550
That's it!

11:28.600 --> 11:31.990
~ Duke, let's have another
song. Get 'em dancing again.
~ Yeah, yeah.

11:32.040 --> 11:33.640
Let's do it.

11:52.200 --> 11:54.200
Victor...?

12:30.960 --> 12:33.670
'Selfridge's attack:
the inside story.

12:33.720 --> 12:37.270
Two weeks ago, attractive redhead Kitty
Edwards was attacked on the street

12:37.320 --> 12:39.590
by a gang of homeless
former servicemen.

12:39.640 --> 12:44.430
A close family member gave us the low-down
on Selfridge's Miss Hoity-Toity'!

12:44.480 --> 12:48.000
~ What a tawdry article.
~ Awful. Don't you think?

12:49.200 --> 12:52.710
'Mr Selfridge, notorious
for his liberal views,

12:52.760 --> 12:57.150
has always promoted those females
who demand to work alongside men.'

12:57.200 --> 13:01.960
'They strut the shop floor, preferring
a wage over wifely duties'!

13:04.600 --> 13:07.030
'Had she not been working
late into the night,

13:07.080 --> 13:09.470
Mrs Edwards might have
avoided her assault.'

13:09.520 --> 13:11.790
~ But it could have happened to any of us.
~ I know.

13:11.840 --> 13:13.840
What's that?

13:25.800 --> 13:30.750
Kitty! I can explain. It's not my fault.
I never said half of it. Not like that.

13:30.800 --> 13:33.950
~ What were you thinking?
~ He told me it would help.

13:34.000 --> 13:37.270
He told me that other people would
say horrible things about you.

13:37.320 --> 13:39.110
Oh, and he hasn't?

13:39.160 --> 13:41.270
I just wanted to come
back and do my job.

13:41.320 --> 13:43.670
It's like having their
hands all over me again!

13:43.720 --> 13:45.720
Kitty!

13:54.960 --> 13:57.900
~ Thank you.
~ That's wonderful. Thank you.

13:58.080 --> 14:00.910
~ Madame Selfridge.
~ Miss Blenkinsop,

14:00.960 --> 14:03.560
you have some information for me?

14:06.400 --> 14:09.310
I left no stone unturned.

14:09.360 --> 14:11.910
Princess Marie Vyazemsky.

14:11.960 --> 14:14.830
Her previous addresses,
a list of her creditors

14:14.880 --> 14:18.720
and what I estimate to
be her outstanding debt.

14:22.640 --> 14:24.720
Ah. I knew it.

14:25.680 --> 14:27.680
Thank you.

14:27.800 --> 14:30.350
~ I'm so sorry...
~ Please don't apologise.

14:30.400 --> 14:32.670
This is a gross intrusion.

14:33.040 --> 14:35.830
It was my sister, Connie.

14:35.880 --> 14:38.400
I know how the press can be...

14:39.520 --> 14:41.860
It never says it exactly...

14:42.280 --> 14:45.380
.. but it's like I deserved
what happened.

14:46.000 --> 14:47.670
I'm going to write a letter.

14:47.720 --> 14:51.150
I'm going to let them know what a good
example you've been to the staff,

14:51.200 --> 14:53.390
how proud I am of the
women that work here,

14:53.440 --> 14:56.760
because at Selfridge's we
always reward hard work.

14:58.280 --> 15:00.420
Thank you, Mr Selfridge.

15:03.680 --> 15:05.870
I understand some of
the staff are talking.

15:05.920 --> 15:10.800
The best thing we can do is ignore
it, carry on, do our jobs well.

15:13.080 --> 15:15.080
No gossip.

15:16.800 --> 15:20.430
Has your father said anything to
you about the Store Deputy job?

15:20.480 --> 15:22.390
I'm not applying for it.

15:22.440 --> 15:26.070
~ Why not?
~ Not enough experience.

15:26.120 --> 15:30.150
You've got lots of experience. You'll
be running the store one day, won't you?

15:30.200 --> 15:33.550
It's the ideal opportunity to learn
alongside him. Gosh, if it was me -

15:33.600 --> 15:35.600
It doesn't matter!

15:39.560 --> 15:41.560
Excuse me.

15:47.960 --> 15:49.960
Edgerton...

15:51.240 --> 15:53.240
Some replies for you.

15:53.920 --> 15:57.000
From the members of the former
Procurement Committee.

15:58.000 --> 15:59.710
A rather mixed bag.

15:59.760 --> 16:04.310
Some haven't replied. Some
have replied at length,

16:04.360 --> 16:06.750
declining your invitation
for a meeting

16:06.800 --> 16:08.990
and expressing outrage
at the very thought.

16:09.040 --> 16:10.590
So, who IS coming?

16:10.640 --> 16:12.980
Well, more than I expected.

16:14.200 --> 16:17.300
Curiosity must have got
the better of them.

16:18.200 --> 16:21.750
~ Did you see your friend Harry
has written to the papers?
~ No.

16:21.800 --> 16:25.510
All because some silly
shop girl got roughed up.

16:25.560 --> 16:28.440
Still, it's all grist to the mill.

16:30.400 --> 16:33.030
I don't suppose you're going
to tell me what you're up to.

16:33.080 --> 16:35.440
Enhancing my reputation.

16:36.360 --> 16:38.500
They're coming at seven.

16:40.040 --> 16:42.040
Don't be late.

16:54.400 --> 16:57.960
Lois! How lovely to see
you. Please come in.

17:05.000 --> 17:07.869
~ You're still here, then?
~ It's my flat.

17:08.319 --> 17:11.560
The decorations are taking
so much longer than planned.

17:12.520 --> 17:15.510
You don't have a flat.
You moved out a month ago.

17:15.560 --> 17:17.869
You thought my son would
put a roof over your head.

17:17.920 --> 17:19.790
When he didn't, you came here

17:19.839 --> 17:21.910
and charged it to him.

17:22.160 --> 17:25.630
I... had no choice.

17:25.680 --> 17:27.680
That I can believe.

17:32.040 --> 17:34.240
A list of your creditors.

17:34.640 --> 17:37.380
Your previous addresses. Your debts.

17:43.400 --> 17:46.520
~ Miss Mardle?
~ Mr Grove, I'm requesting an afternoon off.

17:51.000 --> 17:53.030
~ Very short notice.
~ It's our quietest day,

17:53.080 --> 17:55.270
and I have instructed
my staff accordingly.

17:55.320 --> 17:57.390
~ Very well.
~ Thank you.

17:57.480 --> 18:00.430
Of course, the Store Deputy could
expect very little time off.

18:00.480 --> 18:02.480
Yes.

18:07.520 --> 18:10.760
When Serge and I arrived
in Paris, we had nothing.

18:12.560 --> 18:14.790
No servants. No money.

18:14.840 --> 18:17.560
Only... my title.

18:19.960 --> 18:22.900
We were lucky to escape
with our lives.

18:26.320 --> 18:29.870
You... you can't imagine

18:29.920 --> 18:31.920
what it was like.

18:33.080 --> 18:35.080
So, what did you do?

18:35.560 --> 18:38.030
~ I made friends.
~ And money?

18:38.080 --> 18:40.270
Came from friends.

18:40.320 --> 18:42.920
I will pay them all back one day.

18:44.920 --> 18:46.920
How?

18:47.320 --> 18:50.110
Before I left Russia,
I hid my jewels.

18:50.160 --> 18:53.270
The emeralds alone
are worth a fortune.

18:53.320 --> 18:57.030
~ But they're in Russia.
~ Only my maid, Olga, knows where.

18:57.080 --> 18:59.990
As soon as she can, she
will bring them to me.

19:00.040 --> 19:02.950
So, how did Rosalie
come into the picture?

19:03.000 --> 19:05.030
When Serge fell in love with her.

19:05.080 --> 19:07.870
With her or with her money?

19:07.920 --> 19:11.840
Do you think I would let my only
son go into a loveless marriage?

19:13.200 --> 19:15.940
Of course I wanted the best for him.

19:16.280 --> 19:18.280
I'm his mother.

19:19.320 --> 19:21.950
It's hard enough to let
them go. You know that.

19:22.000 --> 19:24.670
I was lucky. When Harry married Rose,

19:24.720 --> 19:27.670
I felt I'd gained a
daughter, not lost a son.

19:27.720 --> 19:30.120
And they looked after you.

19:35.840 --> 19:38.040
What are you going to do?

19:38.600 --> 19:40.600
I need to think.

19:48.960 --> 19:51.750
Harry. I saw the newspaper.

19:51.800 --> 19:55.110
As if that girl hasn't been through
enough. And that rubbish about you.

19:55.160 --> 20:00.150
Don't worry. I'll set them straight.
I've written to all the papers.
We have to stand up to this.

20:00.200 --> 20:01.910
I knew you would.

20:01.960 --> 20:04.360
I'm so very happy to see you.

20:04.880 --> 20:07.220
And I hope to see you later.

20:09.160 --> 20:12.430
Harry, this is Mr Gerrard,
the architect.

20:12.480 --> 20:14.710
~ Mr Selfridge.
~ You've worked together before?

20:14.760 --> 20:16.630
Not on this scale.

20:16.680 --> 20:19.950
It's truly inspiring.
I've done some plans.

20:20.000 --> 20:22.390
We may want affordable
social housing,

20:22.440 --> 20:26.040
but we'll still need to conform
to planning and sanitation laws.

20:29.080 --> 20:31.680
Mr Gerrard is very meticulous.

20:36.760 --> 20:38.900
Well, how about a model?

20:41.480 --> 20:43.470
That would be wonderful.

20:43.520 --> 20:47.440
So that people can really see it taking
shape and can be inspired by it.

20:50.200 --> 20:52.200
Of course.

20:52.720 --> 20:55.590
Now, I'm keen to hear
your thoughts...

21:05.360 --> 21:07.360
Thanks for coming.

21:08.840 --> 21:10.840
How are you?

21:15.000 --> 21:18.920
Ah. Gentlemen, shall we? Follow me.

21:21.360 --> 21:23.270
Please, take a seat.

21:23.320 --> 21:25.320
Anywhere.

21:37.760 --> 21:41.400
I am very grateful to those
of you who are here.

21:42.400 --> 21:44.800
A few felt unable to attend.

21:46.320 --> 21:49.880
I know why, and I understand.

21:52.760 --> 21:56.560
I want to apologise...

21:58.800 --> 22:02.230
.. to you and...

22:02.280 --> 22:05.220
to the soldiers that
I have let down...

22:05.840 --> 22:09.070
.. when I put profits
over their wellbeing.

22:09.120 --> 22:11.550
Their lives, Loxley.

22:11.600 --> 22:14.750
Your shoddy boots may have
cost them their lives.

22:14.800 --> 22:20.110
~ My actions were shameful, but
I stand before you a changed man.
~ Huh!

22:20.160 --> 22:22.560
The war has changed us all.

22:24.520 --> 22:27.910
We find ourselves in a new world,

22:27.960 --> 22:30.590
one where we may look in vain

22:30.640 --> 22:33.750
for the old traditions,
the old values,

22:33.800 --> 22:38.200
where we may ask: For
what did we fight?

22:40.360 --> 22:44.080
The grand houses in Piccadilly
are rented to foreigners.

22:44.800 --> 22:47.510
Our servants demand exorbitant wages

22:47.560 --> 22:50.430
and seem to have lost
all sense of place.

22:50.480 --> 22:53.190
We have former soldiers, unemployed,

22:53.240 --> 22:55.990
falling into lives
of poverty and crime.

22:56.040 --> 23:00.560
We have women who want
to vote and work...

23:01.960 --> 23:05.760
.. forsaking the duties
of hearth and home.

23:08.760 --> 23:10.760
So...

23:11.560 --> 23:15.550
.. I give you the Loxley
Charitable Foundation

23:15.600 --> 23:17.680
for Former Servicemen.

23:18.440 --> 23:23.310
We should help them take their
place in society again,

23:23.360 --> 23:25.760
these brave men...

23:27.040 --> 23:30.760
.. who gave their all
for King and Country...

23:31.960 --> 23:36.200
.. who have returned to a
world turned upside down.

23:38.600 --> 23:42.480
Let us bring them out
of the shadows...

23:44.080 --> 23:46.150
.. and into the light.

23:59.600 --> 24:01.360
Thank you.

24:08.740 --> 24:11.480
Is the handwriting at all familiar?

24:12.100 --> 24:14.100
I don't recognise it.

24:15.380 --> 24:17.490
What does it say?

24:17.540 --> 24:20.780
Oh, it's unpleasant. We're going
to pass it on to the police.

24:23.180 --> 24:26.340
It's because of that newspaper
article, isn't it?

24:27.580 --> 24:29.580
They know who I am.

24:31.140 --> 24:32.770
Where I work.

24:32.820 --> 24:35.690
The sort of coward who
writes a letter like this

24:35.740 --> 24:38.170
never reveals themselves in person.

24:38.220 --> 24:41.300
We have store security. They'll
make sure you're safe.

24:42.300 --> 24:44.300
Thank you.

24:59.260 --> 25:02.780
I'll call Inspector Johnson
and make sure Frank knows too.

25:03.820 --> 25:07.810
Chief, I couldn't say
in front of Mrs Edwards,

25:07.860 --> 25:10.940
but, well, it's not the only letter.

25:16.340 --> 25:18.770
'Two brave soldiers
end up behind bars.

25:18.820 --> 25:21.360
You'll have to watch your back.'

25:22.940 --> 25:24.810
Should she stay at
home, do you think?

25:24.860 --> 25:27.650
For how long? For the
rest of her life?

25:27.700 --> 25:31.460
Mrs Edwards has done nothing
wrong, Mr Grove. Remember that.

25:50.420 --> 25:52.420
Hello.

25:52.860 --> 25:55.130
Grace... Grace, I'm sorry.

25:55.940 --> 25:58.300
I was rude to you... before.

26:01.420 --> 26:04.770
You were just asking about the
Deputy position because you care,

26:04.820 --> 26:07.300
and I... I want you to know...

26:08.140 --> 26:10.170
.. I'm jolly grateful.

26:10.220 --> 26:12.220
~ Excuse me.
~ Grace...

26:17.860 --> 26:20.970
I've wanted to do that for ages.

26:21.020 --> 26:23.170
Well, you can do it
again, if you like.

26:23.220 --> 26:25.220
All right.

26:40.820 --> 26:42.820
Peace offering.

26:53.220 --> 26:55.700
There.

27:04.980 --> 27:06.980
Thank you.

27:09.380 --> 27:11.890
I'm worried I've upset you, Doris.

27:11.940 --> 27:14.540
No. I was rude to you. I'm sorry.

27:18.740 --> 27:20.740
He's grown.

27:21.780 --> 27:25.080
Do you think he'll take
after you or Mr Grove?

27:30.140 --> 27:32.740
Promise you won't breathe a word?

27:34.780 --> 27:36.780
I promise.

27:40.060 --> 27:42.140
A man in the store...

27:44.180 --> 27:47.620
We were childhood sweethearts.
I hadn't seen him for years.

27:48.340 --> 27:52.900
He went off to France, like all
the men, and then I met him again
when he was home on leave.

27:57.100 --> 28:01.130
Mr Grove was away for months.
I used to think...

28:01.180 --> 28:03.720
'What if I never see him again?'

28:04.420 --> 28:06.130
That's all I wanted - comfort.

28:06.180 --> 28:09.010
Oh, my dear. Lots of things
happened during the war.

28:09.060 --> 28:11.300
And it's Billy's baby.

28:19.100 --> 28:21.100
Madame Selfridge...

28:21.740 --> 28:23.740
Princess Marie.

28:25.260 --> 28:29.170
~ Marie, I'm sorry I haven't been in touch.
~ It's me who should apologise.

28:29.220 --> 28:31.890
~ Oh, that's not necessary.
~ Your family have been so kind.

28:31.940 --> 28:34.330
I can't repay them, but I can -

28:34.380 --> 28:36.850
I'm sure they will understand.

28:36.900 --> 28:39.530
I do have debts - I won't deny it.

28:39.580 --> 28:43.340
Until my jewels come, I am a pauper.

28:44.540 --> 28:46.610
I'll move out of the hotel.

28:46.660 --> 28:50.090
I'll find a bedsit in Bayswater.

28:50.140 --> 28:53.170
~ Marie, will you listen?
~ My grandmother had a recipe for soup -

28:53.220 --> 28:55.050
Can I get a word in?

28:55.100 --> 28:58.890
Marie, you are a mother-in-law
of a Selfridge, and a princess.

28:58.940 --> 29:01.820
There will be no bedsit and soup.

29:04.380 --> 29:08.890
~ You'll have to move in here.
~ Oh... oh, thank you.

29:08.940 --> 29:11.450
But this reckless spending
has to stop.

29:11.500 --> 29:13.250
Oh, it will. It will.

29:13.300 --> 29:17.370
~ Harry is not a bank.
~ No... no, of course not.

29:17.420 --> 29:21.450
And I'd like you to talk to Serge. Things
are not right between him and Rosalie.

29:21.500 --> 29:24.500
I know. I'll do everything
I can to help.

29:26.900 --> 29:30.220
When... can I move in?

29:33.140 --> 29:36.010
~ Hate mail?
~ We passed it to the police.

29:36.500 --> 29:40.490
Damn newspaper article. Always brings
them out of the woodwork. Same person?

29:40.540 --> 29:42.540
All different.

29:45.260 --> 29:47.730
~ Does Kitty know?
~ We had to tell her.

29:47.780 --> 29:52.090
I'm worried I haven't helped. The letter I
wrote may have stirred things up even more.

29:52.140 --> 29:54.170
It may have.

29:54.220 --> 29:56.490
If not for Kitty, for you.

29:57.380 --> 30:01.850
I hear that Lord Loxley's setting up
a charity to help former servicemen.

30:01.900 --> 30:04.770
~ What?
~ It's hard doing business
when you're outside the fold.

30:04.820 --> 30:09.770
He's currying favour, rallying the old
guard who want the world back in 1914.

30:09.820 --> 30:12.050
He's a profiteer -
have they forgotten?

30:12.100 --> 30:14.450
He's tapping into
something - tradition.

30:14.500 --> 30:16.730
It's what a lot of
people want to hear.

30:16.780 --> 30:20.010
You were vocal about your support
for Kitty and women generally.

30:20.060 --> 30:21.890
Loxley's agitating,

30:21.940 --> 30:24.570
setting you up as pro-women
and anti-servicemen.

30:24.620 --> 30:27.810
I have done more for this
country than he ever will.

30:27.860 --> 30:31.060
I won't be put in a corner
by Loxley or the newspapers.

30:35.020 --> 30:38.740
If you could just put them down here
for me. Thank you, Mr Selfridge.

30:40.140 --> 30:42.480
My pleasure, Miss Calthorpe.

30:52.460 --> 30:54.530
My pleasure, Miss Calthorpe.

30:54.580 --> 30:57.330
Won't someone wonder why you're
carrying boxes around?

30:57.380 --> 31:00.770
Oh, I've done a stint in every
department in the store - remember?

31:00.820 --> 31:03.090
No-one will bat an eyelid.

31:06.060 --> 31:08.730
You say you're not ready
for the Deputy job,

31:08.780 --> 31:11.570
but you probably know this
place better than your father.

31:11.620 --> 31:14.610
~ Hardly.
~ Well, when was the last
time he sold a pound of tea

31:14.660 --> 31:19.540
or packed a crate or talked to
buyers or wrote an advertisement?

31:20.660 --> 31:22.850
He's a lot to live up to,

31:22.900 --> 31:25.050
but you're your own man,

31:25.100 --> 31:28.200
and I think you're selling
yourself short.

31:29.300 --> 31:31.300
Maybe I am.

31:35.020 --> 31:37.020
Miss Calthorpe.

31:43.540 --> 31:47.010
~ I need to talk to you.
~ Goodness!

31:47.060 --> 31:50.450
~ The architect's model
- how long will it take?
~ A couple of days.

31:50.500 --> 31:53.210
OK. I'm going to be calling
a press conference

31:53.260 --> 31:55.090
to announce the Selfridge Estates.

31:55.140 --> 31:57.770
~ A press conference?
~ Yes, and I need you beside me.

31:57.820 --> 32:00.250
But we haven't got the funding
or even a bank account.

32:00.300 --> 32:03.610
~ I will raise the money.
~ Why now?

32:03.660 --> 32:05.730
Because I want to show
people where I stand.

32:05.780 --> 32:07.930
I'm not anti-servicemen.

32:07.980 --> 32:12.010
I love this country, and building
those houses will prove that.

32:12.060 --> 32:14.530
I'm not one for the limelight.

32:15.300 --> 32:17.300
I need you.

32:19.900 --> 32:21.850
All right.

32:21.900 --> 32:23.900
Thank you.

32:41.080 --> 32:44.150
~ Thank you for getting
the model done so quickly.
~ Pleasure.

32:44.200 --> 32:47.600
I'll be at the back, if
you need me. Good luck.

32:52.400 --> 32:54.470
They're ready.

32:54.520 --> 32:57.720
I couldn't have got here
without you. You'll be fine.

33:01.600 --> 33:03.600
Ah.

33:08.080 --> 33:10.350
Gentlemen...

33:10.400 --> 33:14.470
We've had a tough couple of weeks, and seeing
as you lot can't get enough of us...

33:14.520 --> 33:17.440
.. I've got some good news for you.

33:19.160 --> 33:22.310
Our world has changed and we're
not sure where to turn.

33:22.360 --> 33:25.470
Now, we all have our differences,

33:25.520 --> 33:27.830
but we can't be a country divided.

33:27.880 --> 33:30.350
That's not what we fought for.

33:31.240 --> 33:33.580
I'm grateful to Miss Webb...

33:34.920 --> 33:36.910
.. for her vision and inspiration.

33:36.960 --> 33:41.110
She brought me an idea, and
I saw it as a chance to help.

33:41.160 --> 33:44.640
So I give you... the
Selfridge Estate.

33:54.400 --> 33:56.030
100 homes,

33:56.080 --> 33:58.030
to be sold at cost

33:58.080 --> 34:01.080
to former servicemen
and their families.

34:03.480 --> 34:07.630
It's an awful lot of money. I'm
very glad the store isn't paying.

34:07.680 --> 34:10.550
Now, as you know, while
the men were away,

34:10.600 --> 34:12.750
the women did their bit as well.

34:12.800 --> 34:16.159
We're giving these families
the homes they deserve.

34:20.639 --> 34:22.639
Hear, hear.

34:26.719 --> 34:28.790
I got your message, Inspector.

34:28.840 --> 34:32.790
Come in. We've had a hard time deciding
what to do with you, Mr Edwards.

34:32.840 --> 34:36.150
It was a serious offence, buying
those men alcohol out of hours.

34:36.199 --> 34:39.030
~ Against the Defence of the Realm Act.
~ I know.

34:39.080 --> 34:40.989
And if I'd known how
it would turn out...

34:41.040 --> 34:43.580
A conviction would mean a fine.

34:45.760 --> 34:49.060
Possibly a prison sentence,
with hard labour.

34:49.719 --> 34:52.679
But you came forward... eventually.

34:53.600 --> 34:56.880
After such a distressing experience...

34:57.920 --> 35:01.400
.. I wouldn't want to deprive Mrs
Edwards of her husband's support.

35:05.160 --> 35:08.160
We won't be pressing
charges, Mr Edwards.

35:11.040 --> 35:12.560
Thank you.

35:14.040 --> 35:16.040
Thank you.

35:30.440 --> 35:33.440
I said I wasn't ready
for the Deputy job.

35:33.760 --> 35:35.950
I was wrong.

35:36.000 --> 35:37.830
Go on.

35:37.880 --> 35:42.510
I've worked on the shop floor, despatch,
finance, personnel, publicity.

35:42.560 --> 35:44.230
No-one else has done all that.

35:44.280 --> 35:47.480
I may be young, but my
experience is unique.

35:48.160 --> 35:50.430
And knowing how the store
works is only half of it.

35:50.480 --> 35:53.280
You need someone who understands you.

35:55.600 --> 35:59.510
Do you remember how mad Ma was at me, when
I left school to come and work here?

35:59.560 --> 36:02.150
She wasn't just mad at YOU.

36:02.200 --> 36:07.150
Well, it was a risk,
but... I was right.

36:07.200 --> 36:09.750
I can manage things when you're
busy with this estate.

36:09.800 --> 36:12.840
I understand how important
it is to you, to the family.

36:13.960 --> 36:15.630
Ma would be proud of it

36:15.680 --> 36:18.680
and happy to see me
take my place here...

36:20.360 --> 36:22.360
.. by your side.

36:28.280 --> 36:30.820
All right. You can have the job.

36:31.920 --> 36:35.640
I may be quick to judge sometimes,
and I'm not always right.

36:37.440 --> 36:39.750
Can I have that in writing?

36:39.800 --> 36:42.150
~ It's not going to be easy.
~ I know.

36:42.200 --> 36:45.230
Don't say anything until
I let the others know.

36:45.280 --> 36:48.790
~ Mr Grove...
~ I'll break it to him gently, somehow.

36:48.840 --> 36:50.980
You'll need his support.

37:08.920 --> 37:10.920
You're late.

37:11.680 --> 37:13.680
I was at work.

37:14.440 --> 37:16.980
There's always something to do.

37:17.280 --> 37:19.360
Connie...

37:30.160 --> 37:32.900
I don't want us to go on like this.

37:34.040 --> 37:36.040
Me neither.

37:38.640 --> 37:41.580
I wish I could tell
you how sorry I am.

37:41.960 --> 37:43.670
You have.

37:43.720 --> 37:46.660
I don't know how to
put things right...

37:46.840 --> 37:48.750
.. cos I can't undo what I've done.

37:48.800 --> 37:50.800
None of us can.

37:51.160 --> 37:54.470
But we're made of strong
stuff, us Hawkins girls,

37:54.520 --> 37:56.790
and I need you...

37:56.840 --> 37:58.980
to help me to be strong.

38:16.720 --> 38:20.400
That was my publisher. Obviously,
they read the newspapers.

38:22.440 --> 38:24.950
They're cancelling the book.

38:25.000 --> 38:28.270
They know we're married. They know
I got those servicemen drunk.

38:28.320 --> 38:30.670
Somebody at the police station
has a loose tongue.

38:30.720 --> 38:32.790
They couldn't fire you cos of that.

38:32.840 --> 38:35.110
They don't want any bad publicity...

38:35.160 --> 38:38.680
which means no-one else will touch
me with a barge pole, either.

38:40.000 --> 38:41.870
For God's sake! I bought
them a whisky.

38:41.920 --> 38:44.750
If I'd known it was going
to end like this...

38:44.800 --> 38:46.800
It's just a book.

39:06.240 --> 39:09.310
This is much bigger
than I was expecting.

39:09.360 --> 39:12.710
It's the Selfridge Estate. It
was never going to be small!

39:12.760 --> 39:14.510
This is about all of us.

39:14.560 --> 39:17.030
What we stand for as a family.

39:17.760 --> 39:20.270
We have our differences...

39:20.320 --> 39:23.430
but when it counts, we pull together

39:23.480 --> 39:25.950
and we look after one another.

39:26.520 --> 39:29.800
I have some other news I'd like
to share with you. Gordon...

39:31.160 --> 39:34.590
Er... I've got a new job.
Pa made me Store Deputy.

39:34.640 --> 39:38.030
Oh, congratulations!

39:38.080 --> 39:40.720
That's fantastic. I'm so excited.

39:42.520 --> 39:46.270
So, this Nancy Webb -

39:46.320 --> 39:48.320
this is her idea?

39:49.200 --> 39:53.280
She's very intelligent, with
a lot of spirit and a big heart.

39:54.720 --> 39:56.470
I see.

39:56.520 --> 39:59.070
And while we're talking
about family, Harry,

39:59.120 --> 40:01.430
there's something I've
been meaning to tell you -

40:01.480 --> 40:05.990
Put them down somewhere!
Mind the furniture!

40:06.040 --> 40:10.950
Such a fuss! I'm sure they're quite
capable. It's just a few cases.

40:11.000 --> 40:13.540
Come along. Bring them in here.

40:15.720 --> 40:18.270
Pile them up there. That's it.

40:18.320 --> 40:22.040
~ Are you moving in?
~ Thanks to your wonderful father-in-law.

40:22.840 --> 40:26.560
Trust me - there's a reason. Like
you said, we look after each other.

40:27.280 --> 40:29.800
~ Put them down there.
~ Welcome.

40:30.560 --> 40:32.190
Thank you.

40:32.240 --> 40:34.910
It will be lovely having
you here, Marie.

40:34.960 --> 40:36.960
Thank you, my dear.

40:37.720 --> 40:41.390
Such a kind girl. You
must pack your bags...

40:41.440 --> 40:44.630
~ I don't want to be rude, but I'm going out.
~ No, not tonight.

40:44.680 --> 40:47.590
~ They're old friends. We're
going to the theatre.
~ All right.

40:47.640 --> 40:49.640
But not too late.

40:51.400 --> 40:53.350
How much more is there?

40:53.400 --> 40:56.160
It's just a few essentials.

40:56.880 --> 40:59.110
To the guest room, please.

40:59.160 --> 41:01.270
You won't even know that I'm here.

41:01.320 --> 41:04.430
I'll be as quiet as a mouse.

41:04.480 --> 41:08.080
~ Marie, you must see this,
the Selfridge Estate.
~ Oh, yes.

41:09.080 --> 41:11.230
Now that you are here...

41:11.280 --> 41:14.880
I'll talk to Serge.
You talk to Rosalie.

41:16.400 --> 41:18.400
Done.

41:18.600 --> 41:21.470
The bar's closing!
The bar is closing.

41:22.920 --> 41:25.660
Finish up, now. The bar is closing.

41:27.480 --> 41:31.070
You need to drink up
now. The bar is closing.

41:31.120 --> 41:33.510
You're late. Everything all right?

41:33.560 --> 41:35.700
Let's go to your office.

41:52.640 --> 41:54.880
I want to have fun.

41:56.560 --> 41:58.700
Don't you want to wait?

42:00.760 --> 42:02.760
I want you.

42:14.640 --> 42:16.640
Fancy a dance?

42:17.800 --> 42:19.800
Why not?

43:00.160 --> 43:03.150
Police! Everybody, stop
what you're doing!

43:03.200 --> 43:05.710
~ What are you doing?
~ Line up against this wall.

43:05.760 --> 43:07.830
~ We've stopped serving!
~ Shut up!

43:07.880 --> 43:09.910
~ Stay!
~ You - follow me.

43:09.960 --> 43:13.160
~ You can't go down there!
~ Stay where you are!

43:13.320 --> 43:15.150
~ What's going on here?
~ Come with me.

43:15.200 --> 43:17.150
~ Get your hands off me!
~ Come with me.

43:17.200 --> 43:19.670
Get off me! What's this about?

43:20.080 --> 43:22.080
~ Come on.
~ Ow!

43:23.200 --> 43:25.910
You calm down. Calm down.

43:25.960 --> 43:29.440
~ I warned you, Colleano.
~ Purkiss! We've done nothing wrong.

43:32.240 --> 43:34.240
What are you doing?

43:35.400 --> 43:37.740
No! Don't drink that drink.

43:38.640 --> 43:40.640
Get up!

43:41.120 --> 43:43.150
Drink it.

43:43.200 --> 43:45.200
Drink it!

43:45.320 --> 43:48.190
~ No!
~ Hold him!
~ Get off me!

43:48.240 --> 43:50.800
Alcohol after hours.

43:51.640 --> 43:53.640
Police witnesses.

43:54.600 --> 43:58.150
~ You think you'll get away with this?
~ Stand still!

43:58.200 --> 44:00.150
And you said you didn't need my help?

44:00.200 --> 44:01.870
You can't do that!

44:01.920 --> 44:04.230
You leave Victor alone,
or you'll regret it.

44:04.280 --> 44:07.470
Violette Selfridge. Does your
father know you're here?

44:07.520 --> 44:11.350
Right. Arrest her and everybody
else in here. Out!

44:11.400 --> 44:15.240
~ Right. Out you go, you.
~ Come on. Move it!

44:17.520 --> 44:19.520
Let's go.

44:40.400 --> 44:43.000
It's late. You shouldn't be here.

44:57.400 --> 45:00.400
I came to say you were
good at the launch.

45:02.000 --> 45:05.100
You looked like you were
enjoying yourself.

45:06.200 --> 45:08.430
Are you sleeping with him?

45:08.480 --> 45:11.580
~ What if I am?
~ That wasn't part of the plan.

45:12.400 --> 45:14.940
~ I know what I'm doing.
~ Do you?

45:15.520 --> 45:17.390
Trust me.

45:17.440 --> 45:20.180
That estate money's as good as ours.

45:33.960 --> 45:36.110
Come to dinner with me tonight.

45:36.160 --> 45:37.590
Is he in love with you?

45:37.640 --> 45:39.070
I don't want your club,

45:39.120 --> 45:41.870
but unless you deal with Purkiss,
you won't have it, either.

45:41.920 --> 45:45.150
~ If Mr Grove finds out,
it'll be the end of us.
~ Leave everything to me.

45:45.200 --> 45:48.830
My display will bring every
London woman to Selfridge's,

45:48.880 --> 45:51.510
dragging her husband and
his cheque book behind her.

45:51.560 --> 45:53.560
Well, let's take a
look at the damage.
