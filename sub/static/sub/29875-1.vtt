08:12.659 --> 08:13.625
Do you need help with those?

08:13.727 --> 08:15.460
Nah, it's okay,
I got this.

08:15.562 --> 08:16.928
Okay.

08:18.165 --> 08:19.998
Wow, your house is dope!

08:20.100 --> 08:20.999
Julian, thank you.

08:21.101 --> 08:22.901
Mom and dad
are right behind us.

08:23.003 --> 08:24.269
You guys, come in,
make yourselves at home,

08:24.371 --> 08:25.871
and I will help out
mom and dad.

08:25.973 --> 08:27.539
-All right.
-Okay.

08:27.641 --> 08:30.842
[marchelle] what did I do
with that extra wrapping paper?

08:30.944 --> 08:31.877
Yes!

08:31.979 --> 08:34.579
Hi, mom!
Hi, dad!

08:34.681 --> 08:35.614
Oh, hi, baby!

08:35.716 --> 08:38.049
Oh, you smell so good!

08:38.151 --> 08:39.684
Thank you. Hi!

08:39.786 --> 08:40.819
[chuckles] hello.

08:40.921 --> 08:41.820
How was the drive?

08:41.922 --> 08:43.288
Long, long!
I still don't know

08:43.390 --> 08:45.056
why you had to move
so far away.

08:45.158 --> 08:46.358
Come on, I've told you
a million times.

08:46.460 --> 08:47.425
If you want to work in tech,

08:47.528 --> 08:48.827
you gotta live
in silicon valley.

08:48.929 --> 08:50.428
We just miss you, sweetheart.

08:50.531 --> 08:51.563
That's all.

08:51.665 --> 08:53.465
I miss y'all, too.

08:53.567 --> 08:55.333
Why'd you bring so much stuff
for three days?

08:55.435 --> 08:56.935
Well, because
we thought it would be nice

08:57.037 --> 08:59.137
to bring a little
of our christmas with us.

08:59.239 --> 09:00.105
Yeah.

09:00.207 --> 09:01.640
Mom, you didn't
need to do that.

09:01.742 --> 09:03.742
I've already got
everything we need,

09:03.844 --> 09:05.076
and it looks perfect.

09:05.178 --> 09:06.778
So, why don't you just
leave these things out here,

09:06.880 --> 09:08.313
and we can just bring
your clothes inside?

09:08.415 --> 09:11.049
-[dad laughing]
-child, don't be ridiculous.

09:11.151 --> 09:13.485
And we can't
have christmas now

09:13.587 --> 09:17.355
without our "ho! Ho! Ho!"
countdown clock.

09:17.457 --> 09:18.890
Oh, but we can.

09:18.992 --> 09:20.592
Or our singing
santa door-greeter.

09:20.694 --> 09:22.627
Please tell me you didn't
actually bring that thing.

09:22.729 --> 09:23.795
Of course, we did,
the kids love it.

09:24.998 --> 09:26.364
You brought
your christmas albums?

09:26.466 --> 09:27.198
-Mm-hmm.
-Yeah.

09:27.301 --> 09:28.967
I don't have a record player.

09:29.069 --> 09:31.803
Well, don't worry about it,
because we brought ours.

09:31.905 --> 09:33.505
[dad laughs]
hey, let's go see this house.

09:33.607 --> 09:35.640
[marchelle] yes! I cannot wait.

09:35.742 --> 09:37.409
[wade] hey, you got
some sandwiches in here?

09:37.511 --> 09:40.211
[horn honks then blares]

09:41.582 --> 09:42.881
[jacquie] hey, royce!

09:42.983 --> 09:45.317
Ohh!

09:45.419 --> 09:47.619
Hi, auntie j.

09:47.721 --> 09:48.620
So good to see you, handsome.

09:48.722 --> 09:49.721
Hi.

09:49.823 --> 09:51.389
Oh... Wow.

09:52.926 --> 09:54.993
[overlapping] hey!

09:56.997 --> 09:58.229
[kiara laughs]

09:58.332 --> 09:59.698
you brought your dog.

09:59.800 --> 10:01.566
We couldn't find anyone
to take him for the holidays.

10:01.668 --> 10:04.069
Royce, go and take louie v
in the house.

10:04.171 --> 10:05.971
Make yourself comfortable.

10:06.073 --> 10:07.939
But, you know, your girl
got him certified

10:08.041 --> 10:09.441
as an emotional support animal

10:09.543 --> 10:11.176
so he could travel
in the main cabin with us.

10:11.278 --> 10:12.844
Of course you did, kiara.

10:12.946 --> 10:15.614
Oh, my gosh, you're never
gonna believe what happened.

10:15.716 --> 10:17.515
They lost my luggage!

10:17.618 --> 10:19.351
All of my clothes.
My shoes!

10:19.453 --> 10:21.252
My makeup.
My skincare products.

10:21.355 --> 10:22.320
All the gifts!

10:22.422 --> 10:23.922
What about
ma's christmas angel?

10:24.024 --> 10:24.689
That too.

10:24.791 --> 10:25.824
-What?
-I know.

10:25.926 --> 10:27.258
I'm so upset.

10:27.361 --> 10:30.095
And they said it never even
made it onto the plane.

10:30.197 --> 10:32.397
And now they got this big
winter storm named "meghan"

10:32.499 --> 10:33.632
that's about to hit chicago,

10:33.734 --> 10:35.634
so who knows when
it's gonna get here.

10:35.736 --> 10:38.503
We can't have christmas
without ma's angel.

10:38.605 --> 10:39.838
We can't have christmas

10:39.940 --> 10:41.306
without my makeup

10:41.408 --> 10:43.074
and my clothes
and my shoes.

10:43.176 --> 10:44.809
Wow, jacquie, is it still
all about you?

10:44.911 --> 10:46.778
Wow.

10:46.880 --> 10:48.113
[scoffs]

10:48.215 --> 10:49.914
oh, my gosh,
look at your house.

10:50.017 --> 10:53.351
Yes! Take me in.
Show me around.

10:53.453 --> 10:55.453
This is fabulous!

10:55.555 --> 10:58.623
Oh, you gotta show me around!
Come on, jacquie, let's go.

10:58.725 --> 11:00.158
I can't wait!

11:00.260 --> 11:02.093
You probably don't even
have any cool clothes in here,

11:02.195 --> 11:04.396
but we'll make it work.

11:04.498 --> 11:06.531
Oh, my god.
Look at this.

11:07.668 --> 11:10.568
Oh, wow!

11:12.739 --> 11:15.540
This is fabulous.

11:15.642 --> 11:16.441
[thud]

11:16.543 --> 11:18.643
oh, did you need some help?

11:18.745 --> 11:19.844
Oh!

11:19.946 --> 11:21.613
It's a smart home.

11:21.715 --> 11:22.781
Oh, really?

11:22.883 --> 11:24.582
Which means that
all the appliances,

11:24.685 --> 11:26.317
security systems, lighting,
and media

11:26.420 --> 11:27.919
are all connected
to the internet,

11:28.021 --> 11:29.688
but don't you worry,
I'll show you how to work it.

11:29.790 --> 11:31.156
Oh, wow!

11:31.258 --> 11:32.457
-This is nice.
-Hi, auntie kiara.

11:32.559 --> 11:34.092
Oh, is that my ava?

11:34.194 --> 11:35.293
Ava!

11:37.664 --> 11:39.664
Look how big you are!

11:39.766 --> 11:41.566
-Sis!
-Hey, girl.

11:41.668 --> 11:43.768
Oh, I've missed you.

11:43.870 --> 11:45.370
-You look fabulous. Yes.
-Is this the baby?

11:45.472 --> 11:46.471
Thank you.

11:46.573 --> 11:47.739
You know, I try my best.

11:47.841 --> 11:49.541
Yeah, you do.

11:49.643 --> 11:50.742
-[laughter]
-yeah.

11:50.844 --> 11:52.777
Wait till you see
the rest of the house.

11:52.879 --> 11:53.578
Come on!

11:53.680 --> 11:55.080
Oh...

11:55.182 --> 11:58.650
Well, I can't wait to see
the rest of your home.

11:58.752 --> 12:00.985
Oh, wow!

12:01.088 --> 12:02.754
-What is she doing?
-[ava continues tumbling]

12:02.856 --> 12:04.856
you'll get used to it.

12:04.958 --> 12:06.925
She's on her hands
more than her feet these days.

12:07.027 --> 12:08.259
You wanna pick her up?

12:08.361 --> 12:10.361
Oh, girl, I don't know
what I'm doing.

12:10.464 --> 12:13.264
She's a baby,
not a combustion engine.

12:13.366 --> 12:14.632
-Okay.
-Yeah.

12:14.735 --> 12:15.533
-Okay. You're right.
-There you go.

12:15.635 --> 12:16.568
I can do this.

12:16.670 --> 12:18.636
It's okay. It's okay.

12:18.739 --> 12:19.704
-Okay.
-It's okay.

12:19.806 --> 12:21.439
This is your auntie jacquie.

12:22.809 --> 12:24.509
Hello.

12:24.611 --> 12:26.778
-How are you?
-[baby fusses]

12:26.880 --> 12:28.613
oh, I'd think
she'd be happier with you.

12:28.715 --> 12:29.581
Come here.

12:29.683 --> 12:31.049
[baby cries]

12:31.151 --> 12:33.651
you really don't know
how to talk to a baby, do you?

12:33.754 --> 12:35.053
Now, this is something else.

12:35.155 --> 12:37.555
I know, it's gorgeous.

12:40.093 --> 12:41.159
Is that your tree?

12:41.261 --> 12:43.595
Yes. Don't you just love it?

12:43.697 --> 12:45.997
Girl, that ain't
no christmas tree.

12:46.099 --> 12:48.800
Yes, it is. I was going
for a gold-and-white motif.

12:48.902 --> 12:52.036
And, honey, where are
all the family pictures?

12:52.139 --> 12:54.472
I haven't had a chance
to put them up yet.

12:54.574 --> 12:56.875
Well, that's a project
we can take on while we're here.

12:56.977 --> 12:59.310
Dad, you don't need
to take on any new projects.

12:59.412 --> 13:00.478
You should just relax.

13:02.682 --> 13:05.350
Oh! What in the world?

13:05.452 --> 13:06.417
-Oh, that's my vacuum.
-Watch out! Watch out!

13:06.520 --> 13:07.752
Ooh!

13:07.854 --> 13:09.420
And it just wanders around
like that on its own?

13:09.523 --> 13:12.357
I have it pre-set
to clean every day.

13:12.459 --> 13:14.459
Well, your dad was hoping
to catch the end of the game,

13:14.561 --> 13:15.894
if that's okay.

13:15.996 --> 13:18.363
Sure, no problem.

13:18.465 --> 13:19.664
Here's the remote.

13:19.766 --> 13:20.465
I don't know
what channel you want.

13:20.567 --> 13:21.900
It's got a couple games.

13:22.002 --> 13:22.901
-Okay.
-I'll try to find one.

13:23.003 --> 13:25.203
Well, all right, baby girl.

13:25.305 --> 13:26.805
Come and show me
around your kitchen,

13:26.907 --> 13:28.773
so I can see
what I'm working with.

13:28.875 --> 13:29.874
Okay.

13:29.976 --> 13:31.009
And when are
we going grocery shopping?

13:31.111 --> 13:32.944
I've already ordered
everything online.

13:33.046 --> 13:34.612
Girl, you can't
order groceries online.

13:34.714 --> 13:38.283
I mean, you have to be able
to feel and touch,

13:38.385 --> 13:39.984
smell everything.

13:40.086 --> 13:41.286
Mom, it's fine.

13:41.388 --> 13:44.189
I've been ordering
my groceries online for years.

13:44.291 --> 13:45.523
Lord, have mercy.

13:45.625 --> 13:48.226
I am so glad I brought
half my kitchen with me.

13:50.597 --> 13:51.863
[bass thumping, music playing]

13:51.965 --> 13:54.299
hey, how do you work
this darn thing?

13:54.401 --> 13:56.501
Dad, please stop.
Let me help you.

13:56.603 --> 13:59.170
[music blasting]

13:59.272 --> 14:01.940
dad! Please,
stop pressing buttons!

14:02.042 --> 14:03.541
What'd you say?

14:03.643 --> 14:05.109
[music and tv blaring]

14:05.212 --> 14:06.945
[♪♪♪]

14:07.047 --> 14:08.880
just make it stop.

14:10.183 --> 14:11.850
Oh...

14:11.952 --> 14:13.284
Wow!

14:13.386 --> 14:15.386
[kiara chuckling]

14:15.488 --> 14:18.156
sis, you have done
so well for yourself.

14:18.258 --> 14:19.324
Thank you.

14:19.426 --> 14:21.059
You've always
been the smart one.

14:21.161 --> 14:22.393
Uh, you're smart, too.

14:22.495 --> 14:25.129
I just work the hardest.

14:25.232 --> 14:26.431
Are you calling me lazy?

14:26.533 --> 14:28.600
Not-- n-not lazy.

14:28.702 --> 14:29.901
I could have sworn--

14:30.003 --> 14:31.803
no, just a little lacking
in focus and follow-through.

14:35.642 --> 14:37.208
That's not true.

14:37.310 --> 14:38.476
How's design school going?

14:38.578 --> 14:39.811
It did not go well.

14:39.913 --> 14:41.412
Why, what happened?

14:41.514 --> 14:44.182
Working full-time
and going to school full-time...

14:44.284 --> 14:45.516
I thought I could do it,

14:45.619 --> 14:48.786
but it just left me
no time for royce.

14:48.889 --> 14:51.189
Hmm.
So what are you doing now?

14:51.291 --> 14:55.026
I'm a personal shopper-
slash-stylist.

14:55.128 --> 14:56.361
[kiara chuckles]

14:56.463 --> 14:57.829
I figured if I'm gonna
go shopping all the time,

14:57.931 --> 15:00.131
I might as well
get paid for it, right?

15:00.233 --> 15:02.233
Well, you can make
a really good living doing that.

15:02.335 --> 15:03.534
Girl, you'd be shocked

15:03.637 --> 15:05.803
how many women don't know
how to dress themselves.

15:10.343 --> 15:11.809
[laughing]
like you, for instance.

15:11.912 --> 15:13.111
Excuse me?

15:13.213 --> 15:15.113
Look at all of
these boring clothes!

15:15.215 --> 15:15.847
Boring?

15:15.949 --> 15:17.515
Ew.

15:17.617 --> 15:20.251
I love this shirt.
Go away!

15:20.353 --> 15:21.953
[kiara laughing]

15:22.055 --> 15:24.022
so, what your love life
looking like, girl?

15:24.124 --> 15:25.189
-Not great.

15:25.292 --> 15:26.958
I've been out on a few dates.

15:27.060 --> 15:28.526
Any second dates?

15:30.497 --> 15:32.163
What are we gonna do with you?

15:32.265 --> 15:34.399
You have no idea
how busy I am.

15:34.501 --> 15:36.000
Girl, bah.

15:36.102 --> 15:38.202
So, I'm gonna need
to borrow a few things.

15:38.305 --> 15:40.171
You know, just until
my suitcase shows up.

15:40.273 --> 15:41.873
Great, just like old times.

15:41.975 --> 15:43.241
Okay.

15:43.343 --> 15:45.143
You can borrow this,
for starters.

15:47.013 --> 15:48.379
I'm not wearing that!

15:48.481 --> 15:50.982
Why not?
It's super-comfortable.

15:51.084 --> 15:52.750
-Comfortable?
-Yes.

15:54.554 --> 15:56.020
Why are you looking at me--
what?

15:56.122 --> 15:58.790
[laughs]
it's just so good to see you.

15:58.892 --> 16:01.125
My sister!

16:02.329 --> 16:04.228
[doorbell chimes]

16:05.465 --> 16:06.597
hi.

16:06.700 --> 16:09.867
You can just put that down
right here, please.

16:09.970 --> 16:11.703

16:27.387 --> 16:29.554

I didn't really appreciate

17:08.194 --> 17:10.061

that was his point.

I'm being paged.

Auntie j, why do you need
such a big house

17:40.360 --> 17:41.592

all by yourself?

17:41.694 --> 17:43.061

selling your company?

really well off this sale.

24:48.821 --> 24:51.388
that real christmas tree
smell, you know?

24:51.491 --> 24:53.290
But I had christmas baking

24:53.392 --> 24:55.059
on the schedule
for this morning.

24:55.161 --> 24:56.494
Oh, jacquie...

24:56.596 --> 24:58.128
You don't really
have a schedule, do you?

24:58.231 --> 24:59.763
Yes. You guys are only here
for three days.

24:59.866 --> 25:01.298
I just wanted to get
everything in.

25:01.400 --> 25:03.234
What is all this?

25:03.336 --> 25:06.136
I whipped up
an egg-and-sausage casserole.

25:06.239 --> 25:07.271
You didn't see the plate

25:07.373 --> 25:10.241
of croissants and muffins
I left out?

25:10.343 --> 25:11.242
Yeah--

25:11.344 --> 25:12.309
I did, baby,

25:12.411 --> 25:14.612
but, you see,
everybody prefers

25:14.714 --> 25:16.814
a hot breakfast
to start their day.

25:16.916 --> 25:18.682
Those eggs were for baking,

25:18.784 --> 25:21.318
and the sausage
was for my cornbread dressing.

25:21.420 --> 25:24.889
Great, now we have a reason
to go to the store after all!

25:27.226 --> 25:29.093
Have a croissant.

25:33.065 --> 25:34.965
[takes a deep breath]

25:35.067 --> 25:36.567
[exhales intently]

25:41.340 --> 25:43.674
[marchelle] come on, wade.
Hurry up, honey, let's go.

25:43.776 --> 25:44.875
[jacquie] you ready to go
pick us out a good tree?

25:44.977 --> 25:45.776
[marchelle]
listen, listen, listen!

25:45.878 --> 25:46.744
You guys, you guys...

25:46.846 --> 25:47.811
Look for the perfect tree.

25:47.914 --> 25:48.879
-Oh, are you ready?
-Okay.

25:48.981 --> 25:51.615
Come on, let's go.

25:51.717 --> 25:53.350
-Come here, babe.
-It's so exciting!

25:54.720 --> 25:56.854
Hey, sorry if it felt like

25:56.956 --> 25:59.490
we were ganging up
on you yesterday.

25:59.592 --> 26:01.725
We just want you
to find someone and be happy.

26:01.827 --> 26:03.394
I know,
and I want that, too,

26:03.496 --> 26:06.764
but I'm just really focused
on my career right now.

26:06.866 --> 26:07.965
Okay, enough about me.

26:08.067 --> 26:09.900
How are things with you,
baby sister?

26:10.002 --> 26:11.302
Mm...

26:11.404 --> 26:13.571
It's been tough
going back to work.

26:13.673 --> 26:15.406
I got two kids now,

26:15.508 --> 26:18.943
and a full-time job
with crazy hours

26:19.045 --> 26:20.444
and lots of responsibilities.

26:20.546 --> 26:22.913
It's a lot to juggle,
you know,

26:23.015 --> 26:26.250
and julian's job situation's
been stressful.

26:26.352 --> 26:27.217
Poor you.

26:27.320 --> 26:28.218
Yeah.

26:28.321 --> 26:30.354
That does sound like
a lot on your plate.

26:30.456 --> 26:33.090
You know, I just wanna
feel like my old self again.

26:33.192 --> 26:35.526
You know, just liking
what I see in the mirror.

26:35.628 --> 26:37.828
I mean, catching julian
staring at me

26:37.930 --> 26:39.430
when he doesn't think
I'm looking.

26:39.532 --> 26:42.333
But I'm just tired
all the time,

26:42.435 --> 26:43.734
and that's not a good look.

26:43.836 --> 26:45.135
What are you talking about?

26:45.237 --> 26:46.570
You look incredible.

26:46.672 --> 26:48.706
Thanks.

26:48.808 --> 26:50.574
You know,
I look at mom and dad...

26:52.044 --> 26:54.345
I just wish that our marriage
could be more like theirs.

26:55.815 --> 26:57.247
From where I sit,

26:57.350 --> 26:59.984
I'd love to find
what you and julian have.

27:00.086 --> 27:00.884
And you will.

27:00.987 --> 27:02.820
You just gotta lighten up.

27:02.922 --> 27:03.687
[laughs]

27:03.789 --> 27:06.523
and open up your heart.
You know?

27:06.626 --> 27:08.759
That's the only way
you're ever gonna let anyone in.

27:08.861 --> 27:10.461
I know.

27:10.563 --> 27:12.363
We're all works in progress.

27:12.465 --> 27:13.430
Mm.

27:14.567 --> 27:16.734
What you all over here
hugging about?

27:16.836 --> 27:18.302
Some more than others.

27:18.404 --> 27:19.336
What?

27:19.438 --> 27:20.804
Oh, I love this one!

27:20.906 --> 27:22.406
Oh, sweetheart, that is so--

27:22.508 --> 27:24.341
okay, guys,
we are looking for a fir tree--

27:24.443 --> 27:26.977
fraser fir, balsam fir,
douglas fir.

27:27.079 --> 27:28.579
How come?

27:28.681 --> 27:29.813
'cause those are the ones
that smell the best,

27:29.915 --> 27:31.515
but only
if they're freshly cut,

27:31.617 --> 27:32.349
right, pop-pop?

27:32.451 --> 27:33.751
That's right.
That's my girl!

27:33.853 --> 27:34.752
Royce, help me out!

27:34.854 --> 27:36.520
What are we looking at, royce?

27:36.622 --> 27:37.388
12!

27:37.490 --> 27:38.589
I think this is our tree.

27:38.691 --> 27:39.823
Is that one tall enough, honey?

27:39.925 --> 27:40.958
I think it's tall enough.

27:41.060 --> 27:42.993
I think it's wide enough.
I think this is our tree.

27:43.095 --> 27:44.862
What do you guys think,
is this the one?

27:44.964 --> 27:45.929
-Yeah!
-All right, high-five.

27:46.032 --> 27:47.765
-Yes! Yes, we did it!
-Good stuff. Good stuff.

27:47.867 --> 27:49.566
Let's get a picture.

27:49.669 --> 27:50.567
-Get in close.
-Okay, on three.

27:50.670 --> 27:52.336
One... Two...

27:52.438 --> 27:53.904
Three! Big smiles!

27:54.006 --> 27:55.172
Yes!

27:55.274 --> 27:57.007
That's the way we do it.

27:57.109 --> 27:58.042
Okay, let's get the saw.

27:58.144 --> 27:59.009
Come on.
We got it.

28:01.180 --> 28:04.782
[♪♪♪]

28:04.884 --> 28:07.418
[marchelle] let's see here...

28:07.520 --> 28:08.919
I'll take three of these.

28:09.021 --> 28:10.788
Two of these.

28:10.890 --> 28:14.258
I'll take three of the snowmen.

28:14.360 --> 28:15.726
Yes. All right.

28:15.828 --> 28:17.861
Oh, and you have fruitcake!

28:17.963 --> 28:19.630
I'll take a fruitcake.

28:19.732 --> 28:22.099
Okay. Here you go.

28:22.201 --> 28:25.035
Mom, why are you buying that?

28:25.137 --> 28:27.538
Because I didn't see it
in jacquie's kitchen.

28:27.640 --> 28:30.641
That's because people
don't actually like fruitcake.

28:30.743 --> 28:32.609
You go do your own thing
with your sisters

28:32.712 --> 28:33.744
and leave me alone.

28:33.846 --> 28:35.579
And we're gonna take
the kids for hot chocolate.

28:35.681 --> 28:36.714
Well, fine.

28:36.816 --> 28:38.449
I'm still not eating
any of your nasty fruitcake.

28:38.551 --> 28:39.650
Suit yourself.

28:39.752 --> 28:42.186
That's nasty!

28:42.288 --> 28:45.089
As a matter of fact,
I'll take two.

28:45.191 --> 28:46.457
[laughter]

28:46.559 --> 28:48.425
look, guys!
Oh, my goodness!

28:48.527 --> 28:49.393
Oh, here we go.

28:49.495 --> 28:52.663
I'm gonna put
on these reindeer ears.

28:52.765 --> 28:53.764
Do it.

28:53.866 --> 28:56.567
That is it. Oh, I've got
the perfect prop for you.

28:57.903 --> 28:58.836
Oh. Oh!

28:58.938 --> 29:00.270
That is hysterical.

29:00.372 --> 29:03.774
Yas! Yas!

29:05.044 --> 29:06.610
That's very, like,
cindy crawford.

29:06.712 --> 29:08.779
"check me out, ladies."

29:12.251 --> 29:16.553
[♪♪♪]

29:16.655 --> 29:18.489
oh, my god.
[laughing]

29:20.593 --> 29:21.859
wow! Those are nice moves.

29:21.961 --> 29:24.495
[laughter stops]
that's embarrassing.

29:24.597 --> 29:25.529
Oh, no, no.

29:25.631 --> 29:27.397
In fact, I was kinda
hoping for an encore.

29:28.868 --> 29:29.800
Mm-hmm.

29:29.902 --> 29:31.869
-Hi.
-Hi!

29:31.971 --> 29:33.403
[kiara] we'll just
leave you two alone.

29:33.506 --> 29:34.905
Hi.

29:35.007 --> 29:37.674
Hi. Listen, I think maybe
we got off on the wrong foot,

29:37.777 --> 29:39.643
and I'm sorry about that.

29:39.745 --> 29:40.878
No.

29:40.980 --> 29:41.945
I'm sorry.

29:42.047 --> 29:44.114
I was so rude,
and I apologize.

29:44.216 --> 29:45.949
My sister reminded me
that, you know,

29:46.051 --> 29:47.151
a lot of people work late

29:47.253 --> 29:49.153
and don't necessarily wake up
at the crack of dawn,

29:49.255 --> 29:50.154
like I do.

29:50.256 --> 29:51.221
[laughs] yeah, that's me.

29:51.323 --> 29:53.257
I rarely get home
before midnight.

29:53.359 --> 29:54.725
Well, what do you do?

29:54.827 --> 29:56.994
Oh, I own a restaurant
about a mile down the road.

29:57.096 --> 29:58.128
Actually, that's why I'm here.

29:58.230 --> 30:01.198
I'm hoping to find garland
and holly for my tables.

30:01.300 --> 30:02.199
Hmm.

30:02.301 --> 30:04.067
Well, what kind of restaurant?

30:04.170 --> 30:06.503
It's called
"colette's kitchen."

30:06.605 --> 30:08.939
I like to think of it
as elevated comfort food.

30:09.041 --> 30:09.973
You should definitely
stop by sometime.

30:10.075 --> 30:10.941
I'll cook for you.

30:11.043 --> 30:13.744
I'd love to.
Who is colette?

30:13.846 --> 30:14.812
That's my grandmother.

30:14.914 --> 30:16.480
She taught me everything
I know about cooking.

30:16.582 --> 30:19.016
So, most of my recipes
are really hers.

30:21.220 --> 30:22.085
How about one of these?

30:25.624 --> 30:27.357
Well, I'm not really
a snow globe person.

30:27.459 --> 30:28.859
Really? 'cause this snowman
driving a convertible

30:28.961 --> 30:30.561
is kinda you.

30:32.198 --> 30:33.263
Huh...

30:33.365 --> 30:34.398
So you think.

30:34.500 --> 30:36.366
Ho, ho.

30:37.436 --> 30:39.469
Here we go.

30:39.572 --> 30:40.971
Yes!

30:41.073 --> 30:42.105
Hey. Oh!

30:42.208 --> 30:43.273
Ha.

30:43.375 --> 30:45.142
We're going to need this tree
to look really nice.

30:45.244 --> 30:47.277
I got it. I got it.
I got it.

30:47.379 --> 30:48.245
Really, louie?

30:48.347 --> 30:49.680
Oh, louie!

30:49.782 --> 30:52.349
Oh, jacquie, I'm so sorry.
Louie, louie.

30:52.451 --> 30:54.551
He never does this at home.

30:54.653 --> 30:55.485
[jacquie] my pillow!

30:55.588 --> 30:56.620
I'm so sorry.

30:56.722 --> 30:58.589
He doesn't like to be
left home alone, you know?

30:58.691 --> 31:01.692
Okay. Okay. Louie.

31:04.530 --> 31:06.396
Now, that's a tree!

31:06.498 --> 31:07.464
-Ah!
-Yes!

31:07.566 --> 31:10.167
Oh, honey.

31:10.269 --> 31:12.436
It really is beautiful, daddy.

31:13.572 --> 31:14.571
Who wants to help decorate?

31:14.673 --> 31:15.706
-Me!
-Me!

31:15.808 --> 31:18.308
It's not gonna be the same
without your angel, mom.

31:18.410 --> 31:20.410
If your grandmother
has anything to do with it,

31:20.512 --> 31:23.947
that suitcase will arrive
right in time for christmas.

31:24.049 --> 31:25.449
That's right.

31:25.551 --> 31:27.150
There's not gonna be
enough decorations.

31:27.253 --> 31:28.852
I'll just order some more.
Benson--

31:28.954 --> 31:30.354
[marchelle]
there is no need for that.

31:30.456 --> 31:32.890
I brought all of this stuff
from home.

31:32.992 --> 31:35.092
Look at all the goodies
grandma brought.

31:35.194 --> 31:38.595
Mom, these don't go at all
with my aesthetic!

31:38.697 --> 31:39.630
Yes, it does.

31:39.732 --> 31:42.532
Yes. Look at this.

31:42.635 --> 31:43.867
I made this one!

31:43.969 --> 31:45.035
This one's my favorite!

31:45.137 --> 31:46.570
[julian]
let's find a good spot, okay?

31:49.842 --> 31:51.041
Here you go.

31:51.143 --> 31:52.409
-[louie barking]
-ooh!

31:52.511 --> 31:53.477
Tag! You're it!

31:55.314 --> 31:57.381
[gasping]

31:57.483 --> 31:58.949
oops.

31:59.051 --> 32:00.517
-My new rug!
-Sorry.

32:00.619 --> 32:02.853
Where's kiara?

32:02.955 --> 32:03.954
She always goes missing

32:04.056 --> 32:05.455
whenever there's family
around to watch royce.

32:05.557 --> 32:07.257
Okay, kids...

32:07.359 --> 32:08.358
Let's go outside.

32:08.460 --> 32:10.260
Come on.
Come on, here we go.

32:15.634 --> 32:16.466
[phone buzzing]

32:16.568 --> 32:17.701
[marchelle]
I'll get some baking soda

32:17.803 --> 32:18.669
and clean this mess up.

32:21.974 --> 32:22.940
Okay...

32:32.351 --> 32:33.450
Here's your ball.

32:33.552 --> 32:35.185
Thank you.

32:35.287 --> 32:37.187
I'm not supposed
to talk to strangers.

32:37.289 --> 32:38.922
That's okay.
Me neither.

32:39.024 --> 32:40.223
What's your name?

32:40.326 --> 32:42.392
[laughs] thought you weren't
supposed to talk to strangers.

32:42.494 --> 32:43.860
Well, considering
we're neighbors,

32:43.963 --> 32:45.028
I guess we can
make an exception.

32:45.130 --> 32:46.096
I'm tyler.

32:46.198 --> 32:47.597
-And your name is?
-Ava.

32:47.700 --> 32:49.499
That's a very nice name.

32:49.601 --> 32:51.568
How come you don't have
any christmas lights?

32:51.670 --> 32:54.037
I guess I wasn't feeling
very christmassy this year.

32:54.139 --> 32:55.005
-That's sad.

32:55.107 --> 32:56.773
-I love christmas.
-Maybe you're right.

32:56.875 --> 32:58.675
Maybe I should add
a couple lights.

32:58.777 --> 33:00.410
We have an ugly fake tree
that nobody wants.

33:00.512 --> 33:01.378
Would you like it?

33:01.480 --> 33:02.746
[laughing]

33:02.848 --> 33:04.147
how can I say "no"
to that?

33:04.249 --> 33:05.515
-Bye!
-See ya.

33:07.853 --> 33:08.885
Just like that.

33:08.988 --> 33:10.020
-Okay.
-There you go.

33:10.122 --> 33:12.222
You all are so cute.

33:12.324 --> 33:13.256
Mm.

33:13.359 --> 33:14.558
Let me take a picture.

33:14.660 --> 33:16.226
Oh, no, I'm a total mess.

33:16.328 --> 33:18.261
Oh, stop it, baby,
you're always beautiful.

33:18.364 --> 33:19.262
-I'm serious!

33:19.365 --> 33:20.497
Just take one of ava.

33:20.599 --> 33:23.533
It's important to capture
all of these precious moments,

33:23.635 --> 33:25.635
especially at christmastime.

33:25.738 --> 33:28.071
Trust me,
you'll thank me one day.

33:28.173 --> 33:31.508
I have just set the timer...

33:31.610 --> 33:32.743
Here we go.

33:32.845 --> 33:33.710
[laughing]

33:33.812 --> 33:35.746
I can't believe
you know how to do that!

33:35.848 --> 33:37.381
Why not? It's easy.

33:37.483 --> 33:38.582
All right, come on.

33:38.684 --> 33:40.117
-Okay.
-Smile.

33:40.219 --> 33:41.485
[snap]

33:41.587 --> 33:43.653
yes!

33:43.756 --> 33:45.655
Mwah!

33:47.159 --> 33:50.027
Grandma, what's your favorite
christmas memory?

33:50.129 --> 33:51.828
A long, long time ago...

33:51.930 --> 33:53.563
Your pop-pop

33:53.665 --> 33:55.532
proposed to me

33:55.634 --> 33:57.434
on christmas eve.

33:57.536 --> 34:01.705
So that has got to be
at the very top of my list.

34:01.807 --> 34:03.373
Yes!

34:03.475 --> 34:05.042
[laughing]

34:06.178 --> 34:07.044
right, boo?

34:07.146 --> 34:08.578
Yeah, mine too.

34:08.680 --> 34:10.680
[chuckling]

34:10.783 --> 34:12.249
my favorite
was your first christmas.

34:12.351 --> 34:15.652
We had you in this cute
little christmas onesie,

34:15.754 --> 34:18.655
and you spotted the cookies
that we laid out for santa,

34:18.757 --> 34:21.158
and even though you were
only ten months old,

34:21.260 --> 34:24.127
you took your first steps
over to that plate to grab one.

34:24.229 --> 34:25.796
[laughing]

34:25.898 --> 34:28.498
and she's still
a little cookie monster.

34:28.600 --> 34:31.001
Just like her fa--
hey! Those aren't done yet!

34:32.905 --> 34:34.771
Tastes ready to me.

34:36.075 --> 34:38.442
Grandma, can we make
some extra cookies for tyler?

34:38.544 --> 34:40.377
I think he's all alone.

34:40.479 --> 34:41.711
Oh, bless your heart, sweetie.

34:41.814 --> 34:44.848
Now, that is
the spirit of christmas.

34:44.950 --> 34:47.250
You see, the key
to good construction

34:47.352 --> 34:49.252
is a solid foundation.

34:50.589 --> 34:52.756
But when can we eat it?

34:52.858 --> 34:53.857
When we're done.

34:53.959 --> 34:55.625
-You gotta be patient.
-I'm bored.

34:55.727 --> 34:56.626
I'm gonna go play.

34:56.728 --> 34:58.829
Come on, ava.

34:58.931 --> 35:01.198
Well, who's gonna
help me with...

35:01.300 --> 35:03.333
-Here, I'll come help you, dad.
-Hurry up.

35:03.435 --> 35:04.634
[julian laughs]
you know, dad...

35:04.736 --> 35:06.403
What are you gonna do
with yourself

35:06.505 --> 35:08.004
now that you're not
going to work every day?

35:08.107 --> 35:09.606
Ah...

35:09.708 --> 35:11.942
I'm gonna learn how to make
gingerbread houses.

35:12.044 --> 35:14.811
And probably spend some more
time with my grandkids.

35:14.913 --> 35:15.846
What would you say

35:15.948 --> 35:18.882
the secret to being married
for 41 years is?

35:18.984 --> 35:20.183
[marchelle]
that there is no secret.

35:20.285 --> 35:21.852
It's not always easy.

35:21.954 --> 35:26.389
But we remember to always
take time for each other.

35:26.492 --> 35:28.358
I mean, we talk,
and we listen,

35:28.460 --> 35:31.895
and we try to remember
that we are in this together,

35:31.997 --> 35:34.698
and so, we always try
to support each other

35:34.800 --> 35:36.666
whenever we can.

35:36.768 --> 35:38.268
Right, baby?

35:38.370 --> 35:39.369
Mm. Yeah.

35:39.471 --> 35:41.304
[blows a kiss]

35:41.406 --> 35:42.539
that was beautiful, mom.

35:42.641 --> 35:43.507
[alarm beeping]

35:43.609 --> 35:44.808
that'll be my cookies.

35:44.910 --> 35:48.111
They are ready!
Here I come.

35:49.281 --> 35:50.680
Oh, these have got to be

35:50.782 --> 35:53.683
the best gingerbread cookies
I have ever made!

35:53.785 --> 35:55.619
Mm. Now, you smell that?

35:55.721 --> 35:58.622
Now, that's what christmas
is supposed to smell like.

35:58.724 --> 36:00.157
If I do say so myself.

36:06.932 --> 36:08.031
Must be such a good feeling,

36:08.133 --> 36:10.400
driving past all the houses
you built over the years.

36:10.502 --> 36:12.636
Some more than others,
believe me.

36:12.738 --> 36:14.104
But, yeah, yeah,

36:14.206 --> 36:16.406
it's nice to be able to see
the fruits of your labor.

36:16.508 --> 36:18.041
[royce]
what's wrong, pop-pop?

36:18.143 --> 36:19.442
You look a little sad.

36:19.545 --> 36:20.477
I do?

36:20.579 --> 36:23.113
Nah, I'm not sad.

36:23.215 --> 36:24.648
Well...

36:24.750 --> 36:26.616
Maybe a tiny bit sad.

36:26.718 --> 36:27.517
How come?

36:27.619 --> 36:28.752
Because there's still
a part of me

36:28.854 --> 36:29.753
that doesn't wanna retire.

36:29.855 --> 36:30.854
Why?

36:30.956 --> 36:34.324
My dad started my company
a long, long time ago,

36:34.426 --> 36:36.193
and I just don't wanna
have to say goodbye.

36:36.295 --> 36:38.061
But now you'll get to do
lots more fun stuff,

36:38.163 --> 36:39.663
like, come and visit me.

36:41.266 --> 36:42.899
Yeah.

36:44.002 --> 36:44.901
[exhaling contentedly]
ah...

36:45.003 --> 36:47.103
Ahh, it feels good
to get some fresh air.

36:47.206 --> 36:48.138
Yeah.

36:48.240 --> 36:49.406
Well, if you had a dog,

36:49.508 --> 36:52.442
you at least have to go out
for walks four times a day.

36:52.544 --> 36:54.477
That's a good idea, sis,

36:54.580 --> 36:57.314
except for, I like my furniture
better when it's not trashed.

36:57.416 --> 36:58.648
Are you calling
my house dirty?

36:58.750 --> 36:59.716
I...

36:59.818 --> 37:01.551
I could've sworn
you just said my house is dirty.

37:01.653 --> 37:02.485
I didn't say it was dirty,
I'm just--

37:02.588 --> 37:04.154
-yes, you did.
-No, I didn't. I just...

37:04.256 --> 37:06.122
Whoa.

37:06.225 --> 37:07.824
Well, merry christmas to me.

37:07.926 --> 37:09.559
It's obvious
where louie wants to go.

37:09.661 --> 37:10.627
Yeah. Well, let me

37:10.729 --> 37:13.630
let louie v and I go find
these men over here.

37:13.732 --> 37:14.731
-[laughing]
-see ya later.

37:14.833 --> 37:16.333
[calls out] hello!

37:16.435 --> 37:17.400
Hey.

37:17.502 --> 37:18.868
Thought that was you.

37:18.971 --> 37:19.903
You weren't kidding about

37:20.005 --> 37:21.638
the "see you around
the neighborhood" thing.

37:21.740 --> 37:23.506
Well, I was hoping
to run into you again.

37:23.609 --> 37:26.943
My sister wanted
to bring her dog to the park.

37:27.045 --> 37:29.746
Yeah. And how's that going,
by the way?

37:29.848 --> 37:32.148
First christmas
in my new house,

37:32.251 --> 37:34.818
I thought it'd be nice to invite
my whole family.

37:34.920 --> 37:36.119
What was I thinking?

37:36.221 --> 37:37.520
Well, I don't know
what's worse.

37:37.623 --> 37:39.489
A bunch of loud, messy,
noisy people

37:39.591 --> 37:42.592
or a quiet house
all to yourself.

37:42.694 --> 37:44.461
Oh, I'd take the latter
any day.

37:44.563 --> 37:45.662
Ah, not me.

37:45.764 --> 37:47.597
It's a little too quiet
at the moment for my liking.

37:47.699 --> 37:48.865
Do you have a minute?

37:48.967 --> 37:49.833
Yeah, of course.

37:49.935 --> 37:50.834
Okay.

37:50.936 --> 37:51.801
Where is your family?

37:51.903 --> 37:53.737
So...

37:53.839 --> 37:55.639
My kids...

37:55.741 --> 37:57.173
Are with
their mom for christmas.

37:57.276 --> 37:59.843
Sorry. That must be hard.

37:59.945 --> 38:02.279
It's okay.
We take turns with the holidays,

38:02.381 --> 38:05.048
and, honestly, the kids
seem happier since our divorce.

38:05.150 --> 38:08.685
My mom always says
"every pot has its lid,"

38:08.787 --> 38:10.487
but I don't know if that's true.

38:10.589 --> 38:11.988
I think it is.

38:12.090 --> 38:13.523
Yeah, but what if
that pot boils over?

38:13.625 --> 38:15.091
The lid goes flying off,
and then you're left

38:15.193 --> 38:16.359
with this big ol' mess,
and it just...

38:16.461 --> 38:18.028
[laughs] so you're saying

38:18.130 --> 38:19.296
it's better not to cook at all?

38:19.398 --> 38:21.398
I... I don't-- I don't know
what I'm saying.

38:21.500 --> 38:24.067
I'm so sorry.
I'm so bad at this.

38:24.169 --> 38:25.001
At what?

38:25.103 --> 38:26.636
At flirting.

38:26.738 --> 38:28.905
Don't sell yourself short.

38:29.007 --> 38:30.707
I mean, you got
your own thing going on.

38:34.346 --> 38:36.012
[barking]

38:36.114 --> 38:37.847
oh!

38:37.949 --> 38:40.817
Louie!

38:40.919 --> 38:41.718
Oh!

38:41.820 --> 38:43.119
[thud]

38:43.221 --> 38:44.287
oh!

38:45.924 --> 38:48.158
[tyler] jacquie!

38:49.394 --> 38:50.860
Ugh.

38:50.962 --> 38:52.162
You got a little dent
there now.

38:52.264 --> 38:54.097
So it's no big deal then.

38:54.199 --> 38:55.565
You sure you're okay?

38:55.667 --> 38:57.167
You don't need me to call 911,
or something?

38:57.269 --> 38:58.168
Oh, we good.

38:58.270 --> 38:59.336
We good.

38:59.438 --> 39:01.538
-Can you help me up?
-You want me to walk you home?

39:01.640 --> 39:02.872
No, no, we're good.
I got her.

39:02.974 --> 39:03.873
-Sis.
-You okay?

39:03.975 --> 39:05.108
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

39:05.210 --> 39:06.276
-Thank you so much.
-Okay,<i> bye.</i>

39:06.378 --> 39:08.645
-Did he do anything to you?
-What is wrong with you?

39:08.747 --> 39:09.412
I leave you alone
for just 30 seconds.

39:09.514 --> 39:10.380
We were flirting.

39:10.482 --> 39:11.548
Come on, baby.

39:11.650 --> 39:13.616
Get the dog before he tracks
mud all over my house.

39:13.719 --> 39:15.752
Louie!

39:15.854 --> 39:17.087
Can someone get louie?

39:18.557 --> 39:20.724
What is all this?

39:20.826 --> 39:23.426
It looks like somebody
went on a shopping spree,

39:23.528 --> 39:25.161
and, for once,
it was not on me.

39:25.263 --> 39:26.162
Treena?

39:26.264 --> 39:27.163
What's going on?

39:27.265 --> 39:29.065
-You tell me!
-I don't know!

39:29.167 --> 39:30.367
You don't know anything
about this?

39:30.469 --> 39:32.502
No. Is this some kind of joke?

39:32.604 --> 39:33.470
Well, if it is...

39:33.572 --> 39:34.504
Joke's on you, j,

39:34.606 --> 39:36.873
because all of these
are addressed to you.

39:36.975 --> 39:37.774
Oh, my gosh.

39:37.876 --> 39:40.009
I know these cookies
from anywhere.

39:40.112 --> 39:41.911
This has royce's
greasy little hands

39:42.013 --> 39:43.213
written all over it.

39:43.315 --> 39:44.781
[laughing]

39:44.883 --> 39:46.783
and I think I know who
his accomplice might've been.

39:46.885 --> 39:48.752
Oh, I can confirm

39:48.854 --> 39:50.687
this is definitely
not mine.

39:50.789 --> 39:51.621
-Are you sure?
-Yeah.

39:51.723 --> 39:53.990
I think it'd look
really nice on you.

39:54.092 --> 39:55.458
And here's the video game

39:55.560 --> 39:57.894
that I told royce
he couldn't have.

39:57.996 --> 39:59.195
That sneaky little...

39:59.297 --> 40:00.563
Make it stop, please.

40:00.665 --> 40:02.132
-Oh, my goodness.
-Thank you.

40:03.902 --> 40:05.835
-Yes, baby!
-Really?

40:05.937 --> 40:06.770
That's a good boy.

40:06.872 --> 40:09.372
Yes, he is.
He's just a widdle dirty!

40:09.474 --> 40:11.775
Yes, he is just a little dirty.

40:11.877 --> 40:13.276
So...

40:13.378 --> 40:16.646
What were you and that mr. Tyler
talking about?

40:16.748 --> 40:17.947
I don't know.

40:18.049 --> 40:19.182
Nothing special.

40:19.284 --> 40:22.218
You like him.
I can tell.

40:22.320 --> 40:23.753
[giggles]

40:23.855 --> 40:25.588
you remember
what grandma used to say?

40:25.690 --> 40:26.489
What?

40:26.591 --> 40:28.191
Find someone
that makes you smile,

40:28.293 --> 40:30.460
and never let them go.

40:30.562 --> 40:33.630
How did she cram
so much wisdom

40:33.732 --> 40:36.065
into that tiny, little body
of hers?

40:36.168 --> 40:38.034
I know, right?

40:38.136 --> 40:39.202
No fair.

40:39.304 --> 40:41.738
Louie gets to take
a bubble bath in the fancy tub.

40:43.041 --> 40:45.708
Ava, do you know anything
about those boxes out front?

40:45.811 --> 40:47.143
Yeah, they're from
the magic benson machine.

40:47.245 --> 40:49.245
You just say
whatever you want out loud,

40:49.347 --> 40:50.713
and then, poof!
...It just comes to your door.

40:52.083 --> 40:53.583
[both cracking up]

40:53.685 --> 40:55.018
what? I don't get it.

40:55.120 --> 40:56.719
-Oh!
-[shrieking]

40:58.223 --> 40:59.756
oh, louie.

41:06.231 --> 41:07.230
Thanks, baby.

41:07.332 --> 41:09.432
Oh, my gosh, I'm soaked.

41:09.534 --> 41:11.701
-Yeah, sorry.
-Oh, he got us good.

41:11.803 --> 41:13.069
Uh-huh.

41:13.171 --> 41:14.537
Well, he did us a favor,

41:14.639 --> 41:16.239
'cause I wasn't gonna
wash your blouse anyway, so--

41:16.341 --> 41:18.475
oh, yes, you were,
miss ma'am.

41:18.577 --> 41:19.576
-No, I wasn't.
-Mm-hmm. Yes, you were.

41:19.678 --> 41:21.144
[kiara laughs]

41:21.246 --> 41:23.246
so, what's your game plan
with tyler?

41:23.348 --> 41:24.681
I mean, I don't have one.

41:24.783 --> 41:26.416
I never do
when it comes to guys.

41:26.518 --> 41:28.885
Well, there it is,
that's your problem.

41:28.987 --> 41:30.787
Relationships
don't just happen on their own,

41:30.889 --> 41:32.822
they take effort,

41:32.924 --> 41:34.190
just like everything else
in your life.

41:35.393 --> 41:37.393
So what should I do?

41:38.763 --> 41:41.030
Are you... Are you really
asking me for my advice?

41:41.132 --> 41:42.565
Sure, why not?

41:42.667 --> 41:43.766
It's just that, my whole life,

41:43.869 --> 41:45.902
you've never really
asked my advice about anything.

41:46.004 --> 41:47.637
Now, kiki,
that is not true.

41:47.739 --> 41:49.205
Yes, it is.

41:49.307 --> 41:52.141
You've always made me feel
like my ideas didn't matter.

41:52.244 --> 41:54.644
I'm so sorry, kiki.

41:54.746 --> 41:57.180
I had no idea
I made you feel that way.

41:57.282 --> 41:58.948
[kiara sighs]

41:59.050 --> 42:00.984
for what it's worth...

42:01.086 --> 42:03.686
I really do value your opinion.

Well, I really appreciate
you saying that.

That's so sweet of you.

She is so worried about you
being all alone for christmas.

I'm better than fine.

Beautiful night, isn't it?

45:01.433 --> 45:03.566
You were right.

45:03.668 --> 45:04.934
About what?

45:05.036 --> 45:07.103
About being bad at flirting.

45:07.205 --> 45:08.237
It's just nice

45:08.339 --> 45:11.641
that I'm not doing
something embarrassing for once.

45:11.743 --> 45:13.376
I like
the embarrassing moments.

45:13.478 --> 45:14.877
They're endearing.

45:14.979 --> 45:16.713
Yeah, but I'm usually type a.

45:16.815 --> 45:20.550
But, around you,
definitely type d.

45:21.619 --> 45:22.518
"dork."

all right, I'd better not
push my luck.

45:31.463 --> 45:33.362
I think I'd better
call it a night

45:33.465 --> 45:36.833
before I find some new way
to embarrass myself after all.

45:36.935 --> 45:38.267
All right.

45:39.504 --> 45:40.236
Okay.

I don't get why we're doing
all this cooking today.

46:24.382 --> 46:26.415
I told you,
the film crew's coming over.

46:26.518 --> 46:28.050
So, we're pretending
like today is christmas?

46:28.153 --> 46:29.085
Some of these dishes

46:29.187 --> 46:30.319
we have to make
a day ahead anyway,

46:30.421 --> 46:32.155
and we can still
eat everything tomorrow.

46:32.257 --> 46:35.658
So, our christmas dinner
will be day-old leftovers?

46:35.760 --> 46:37.660
That ain't right.

46:38.763 --> 46:39.962
What is that?

46:40.064 --> 46:43.032
Oh, that's a nice
red velvet cake for dessert.

46:43.134 --> 46:44.500
When did you have time
to make it?

46:44.602 --> 46:45.768
I didn't.
I ordered it.

46:45.870 --> 46:49.005
You ordered
our christmas desserts?

46:49.107 --> 46:49.906
Like, a bakery?

Mm-hmm.

46:52.410 --> 46:53.409
What about my peach cobbler?

46:53.511 --> 46:54.710
I just thought

46:54.813 --> 46:57.680
that a fancy cake would look
nicer on display, mom.

Oh, so...

Of course, we're gonna
have peach cobbler, honey.

47:11.729 --> 47:14.263
I mean, what's the point
of christmas traditions

47:14.365 --> 47:17.366
if you're just
going to ignore them all?

47:17.468 --> 47:19.302
Why can't I start
a few traditions of my own?

47:19.404 --> 47:21.103
Because that's not
how it works.

47:21.206 --> 47:24.807
You pass them down
from generation to generation,

47:24.909 --> 47:27.109
and they become
a part of your family's story.

47:27.212 --> 47:30.146
I mean, honey, they're what
link us to our past,

47:30.248 --> 47:32.448
and connect us to our ancestors.

Christmas is supposed
to be warm, cozy, and cheerful,

is none of those things.

48:43.454 --> 48:45.988

51:10.535 --> 51:11.967
[voice cracks] my vase!

51:12.070 --> 51:14.737
[marchelle] kiara!

51:14.839 --> 51:16.639
How long do you think
we can hide up here for?

51:16.741 --> 51:19.942
Oh, I wasn't planning
on going back down there.

51:20.044 --> 51:21.410
[both laughing]

51:21.512 --> 51:23.679
oh, here.

51:23.781 --> 51:25.614
Merry christmas.

51:25.716 --> 51:26.882
You're giving me my gift now?

51:26.984 --> 51:29.385
I think it's a good time.

51:32.356 --> 51:34.190
Ah...

51:34.292 --> 51:35.658
I thought you said your presents
were in your suitcase.

51:35.760 --> 51:37.493
I picked up
a few things yesterday...

51:37.595 --> 51:40.029
Just in case.

51:42.900 --> 51:44.733
Thank you.

51:46.204 --> 51:47.369
[clink]

51:47.472 --> 51:49.238
-merry christmas.
-Merry christmas, sis.

51:50.541 --> 51:51.440
[overlapping] mm!

51:51.542 --> 51:53.476
Mm, mm, mm.

51:57.115 --> 51:58.747
Well, sorry, sweetie,

51:58.850 --> 52:00.416
but it's beyond
my level of expertise.

52:00.518 --> 52:03.486
Oh... No.

52:03.588 --> 52:05.721
Well, give it some time.
It might reset itself.

52:05.823 --> 52:08.724
Maybe we can salvage this video
with a turkey scene.

52:08.826 --> 52:10.259
Yes. Yes, we can.

52:10.361 --> 52:11.293
Mixer.

52:11.395 --> 52:12.695
Whatever I can do to help.

52:12.797 --> 52:13.562
-Okay.
-Here.

52:13.664 --> 52:14.830
Thanks.

52:14.932 --> 52:16.999
[marchelle] honey!
Can I borrow you for a sec?

52:17.101 --> 52:19.068
You're doing great.

52:20.204 --> 52:21.337
[laughing]

52:21.439 --> 52:24.974
I mean, maybe we should
just create our own app.

52:25.076 --> 52:26.909
I mean, how hard can it be?

52:27.011 --> 52:28.544
I'm just as smart as jacquie.

52:28.646 --> 52:31.080
She has a degree
in computer engineering

52:31.182 --> 52:32.081
from m.I.T.

52:32.183 --> 52:33.215
So?

52:33.317 --> 52:35.050
[laughing]

52:35.153 --> 52:36.018
you make a good point.

52:36.120 --> 52:38.087
I try.

52:39.690 --> 52:40.890
So...

52:40.992 --> 52:42.358
How's life in chicago?

52:42.460 --> 52:43.859
It's okay.

52:43.961 --> 52:46.262
You know, it's not easy
being a single mom

52:46.364 --> 52:48.164
and doing it by myself.

52:49.267 --> 52:50.666
Yeah, I bet.

52:50.768 --> 52:52.434
But I try my best.

52:53.638 --> 52:56.539
But I second-guess myself
all the time.

52:57.942 --> 53:01.877
I wonder if I'm messing up
in some kind of way.

53:01.979 --> 53:04.446
I see how you are with royce.
You're doing just fine.

53:04.549 --> 53:06.448
Thanks.

53:07.785 --> 53:09.818
And I love the holidays.

53:09.921 --> 53:11.954
That he gets to spend
time with you and dad.

53:12.056 --> 53:13.822
But I'm always worried
that he doesn't have

53:13.925 --> 53:17.193
enough good male role models
in his life.

53:19.363 --> 53:21.330
I think
you're worrying too much.

53:21.432 --> 53:24.667
Royce is a great kid,
and that's all because of you.

53:27.004 --> 53:28.337
[sighs]

53:28.439 --> 53:29.471
thanks, bro.

53:29.574 --> 53:31.740
You know I got you.

53:31.842 --> 53:32.775
Appreciate that, man.

53:32.877 --> 53:34.376
[clink]

53:36.447 --> 53:39.114
so, we put the oil in the pot,
but we only fill it halfway.

53:39.217 --> 53:41.517
[ava] hey, mommy, watch this!

53:41.619 --> 53:43.152
[treena] oh, ava, baby.

53:43.254 --> 53:44.553
Ava.

53:44.655 --> 53:47.189
Don't you think that's
enough gymnastics for today?

53:47.291 --> 53:49.158
Just five more minutes, please.

53:49.260 --> 53:50.593
Yeah, you look great.

53:50.695 --> 53:52.595
Just watch me for,
like, five seconds.

53:52.697 --> 53:53.929
Oh, look at those toes.

53:54.031 --> 53:56.265
Yeah, aren't you
getting tired, girl?

53:57.501 --> 53:58.934
[laughs]

53:59.036 --> 54:00.069
okay, there we go.

54:00.171 --> 54:02.538
[flames whooshing]

54:02.640 --> 54:04.306
okay, now what?

54:04.408 --> 54:06.742
Now we wait for the oil
to heat up.

54:06.844 --> 54:08.143
-Right?
-Yes.

54:08.246 --> 54:09.778
-Okay.
-Okay.

54:09.880 --> 54:11.814
Let me go get the turkey.

54:11.916 --> 54:13.682
Hello! We're about
to fry the turkey,

54:13.784 --> 54:15.851
if anyone wants to come watch.

54:17.088 --> 54:18.053
Dare we go back down there?

54:18.155 --> 54:19.388
Let's do it.

54:21.425 --> 54:22.358
Mm.

54:22.460 --> 54:25.261
I'm gonna wrap this
back up again.

54:25.363 --> 54:26.362
You're gonna have to act

54:26.464 --> 54:29.164
surprised
and a little bit more excited

54:29.267 --> 54:30.332
when you have to re-open it.

54:30.434 --> 54:31.433
[laughs] okay.

54:31.535 --> 54:33.035
But, just so we're clear,

54:33.137 --> 54:34.870
it's going to look like
you're giving me

54:34.972 --> 54:36.438
a half-drank
bottle of bailey's.

54:36.540 --> 54:38.440
Oh, this is as good gift,
coming from me.

54:38.542 --> 54:39.908
I've done way worse.

54:40.011 --> 54:41.844
[both laughing]

54:41.946 --> 54:44.546
[oohing, overlapping]

54:44.649 --> 54:46.215
-yes.
-Okay.

54:46.317 --> 54:47.716
-Ready?
-Hold on. Hold on.

54:47.818 --> 54:49.285
Let's take a selfie.

54:49.387 --> 54:51.220
[all] ohh!

54:51.322 --> 54:52.388
[laughter]

54:52.490 --> 54:53.589
okay.

54:53.691 --> 54:55.357
[snap]

54:55.459 --> 54:56.659
okay.
Dad, this thing's heavy.

54:56.761 --> 54:57.893
-Look at her!
-Okay. All right, here we go.

54:57.995 --> 54:59.428
Okay, here we go.

55:00.431 --> 55:01.797
[sizzling]

55:01.899 --> 55:02.798
oh.

55:02.900 --> 55:04.266
Okay. Oh...

55:04.368 --> 55:06.502
Oh.

55:06.604 --> 55:07.870
Oh, whoa, whoa--

55:07.972 --> 55:09.004
I don't think this is...

55:09.106 --> 55:09.938
Uh, uh, whoa, whoa, whoa!

55:10.041 --> 55:12.207
[all yelling]

55:12.310 --> 55:15.044
oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh!

55:15.146 --> 55:16.312
Back, back, back, back, back!
Fire, fire, fire.

55:16.414 --> 55:17.780
[panic continues]

55:17.882 --> 55:18.547
where's your fire extinguisher?

55:18.649 --> 55:20.082
I don't have one!

55:20.184 --> 55:21.050
You own every gadget under the
sun, how do you not have one?

55:21.152 --> 55:22.318
-I don't know!
-[shrieking]

55:22.420 --> 55:23.252
whoa.

55:23.354 --> 55:24.787
Stay back. Stay back.

55:24.889 --> 55:26.422
I'll go get the water hose.

55:26.524 --> 55:28.524
No, no, no, it's a grease fire.
Find some blankets.

55:28.626 --> 55:30.426
-Right here. Right here.
-Here's a blanket. Here.

55:30.528 --> 55:31.260
This is out of control.
We gotta get out of here.

55:31.362 --> 55:32.194
We gotta get out of here.

55:32.296 --> 55:33.395
Be careful, julian.

55:33.497 --> 55:35.197
-Be careful. Oh.
-Oh! My cashmere blanket!

55:35.299 --> 55:36.799
Are you still getting this?

55:36.901 --> 55:38.701
[screaming]

55:40.037 --> 55:41.337
-you all right?
-I think it's out.

55:41.439 --> 55:42.938
You really saved the day.

55:43.040 --> 55:44.306
Are you okay?

55:44.408 --> 55:46.041
J, you okay?

55:46.143 --> 55:47.142
Are you kidding me?

55:48.746 --> 55:50.245
-Are you kidding me?
-Come on, baby.

55:50.348 --> 55:52.214
Baby, it's gonna be okay.

55:52.316 --> 55:54.516
Don't "come on, baby" me.
It's not gonna be okay!

55:54.618 --> 55:56.652
I thought about everything.

55:56.754 --> 56:00.823
I planned every little detail,
and nothing has come out right.

56:00.925 --> 56:02.658
-It's okay, we can fix this.
-We can't fix this!

56:02.760 --> 56:05.594
This isn't like
one of your little messes

56:05.696 --> 56:07.963
where someone swoops in
and rescues you from yourself.

56:08.065 --> 56:08.931
Oh, really?

56:09.033 --> 56:10.132
You!

56:10.234 --> 56:11.900
You and your stupid
extra christmas lights!

56:12.002 --> 56:13.502
And you!

56:13.604 --> 56:14.636
You and your dog!

56:14.739 --> 56:16.638
I mean, any normal person

56:16.741 --> 56:19.274
would ask permission
before you just bring a dog.

56:20.478 --> 56:21.677
Jacquie, I'm so sorry.

56:21.779 --> 56:22.845
[coughing]

56:29.253 --> 56:30.819
maybe there's still some meat
on the inside that isn't burnt.

56:39.130 --> 56:40.496
[all shouting]

56:41.799 --> 56:43.632
jacq...

56:43.734 --> 56:46.735
It wasn't supposed
to be like this.

56:49.039 --> 56:50.939
-Oh, baby.
-Jacquie, wait.

56:51.041 --> 56:53.475
[sighing]

56:53.577 --> 56:54.643
ahh.

56:54.745 --> 56:56.111
Let's go talk to her.

56:56.213 --> 56:58.380
You guys get this cleaned up.

56:58.482 --> 56:59.882
[coughing]

56:59.984 --> 57:02.184
well, you guys should start.

57:03.587 --> 57:04.620
[feigns coughing]

57:04.722 --> 57:05.687
-I'll go get some water.
-Yeah.

57:05.790 --> 57:07.956
I don't know
how we're gonna fix this.

57:08.058 --> 57:09.591
[chuckles]

57:09.693 --> 57:10.926
wow.

57:11.028 --> 57:12.094
I...

57:12.196 --> 57:13.495
Wow.

57:13.597 --> 57:15.164
[hailey babbles]

57:16.434 --> 57:18.300
you're the only one
in this house I'm not mad at.

57:18.402 --> 57:20.702
No one appreciates
how hard I worked

57:20.805 --> 57:24.106
to make everything
look just right.

57:28.712 --> 57:30.479
No one respects my house.

57:31.816 --> 57:35.117
No one understands what a big
opportunity this was for me.

57:35.219 --> 57:37.252
Except for you.

57:42.026 --> 57:44.293
[hailey cries]

57:49.266 --> 57:51.400
[crying]

57:51.502 --> 57:54.203

[jacquie cries]

58:08.953 --> 58:11.353
<i> you all knew</i>
<i> how much today meant to me,</i>

58:11.455 --> 58:13.889
<i> but you didn't care.</i>

58:13.991 --> 58:16.124
<i> You embarrassed me in front of</i>
<i>the people I needed to impress.</i>

58:16.227 --> 58:17.092
[message whooshes]

58:17.194 --> 58:18.460
"christmas is canceled."

58:20.130 --> 58:22.798
wow, she is really mad.

58:22.900 --> 58:24.566
She has every right to be.

58:24.668 --> 58:27.169
She had a lot riding
on that film shoot.

58:27.271 --> 58:28.337
Is christmas really canceled?

58:28.439 --> 58:29.505
No, honey.

58:29.607 --> 58:32.908
Your aunt jacquie just needs
some time to cool off,

58:33.010 --> 58:34.142
that's all.

58:34.245 --> 58:37.880
So, what should we do?

58:37.982 --> 58:40.349
Let's just go outside
for a walk.

58:40.451 --> 58:42.351
-That's a good idea.
-Yeah.

58:43.487 --> 58:44.753
Come on, guys.

58:45.956 --> 58:48.724
-I'm gonna go grab hailey.
-All right.

[sniffs]

58:53.364 --> 58:55.197
[exhales in disgust]

58:57.167 --> 58:58.400
what's going on?

58:58.502 --> 59:01.103
Hey. Uh, we're in time-out.

59:01.205 --> 59:02.638
All of you?

59:02.740 --> 59:03.939
We were very bad.

59:04.041 --> 59:04.973
[treena]
jacquie just needs a moment.

59:05.075 --> 59:06.542
[tyler] you want me
to try talking to her?

59:06.644 --> 59:08.577
I could be like switzerland.

59:08.679 --> 59:09.778
You can try.

59:09.880 --> 59:11.680
Okay.

59:11.782 --> 59:12.981
Hi, tyler.

59:13.083 --> 59:13.882
Hello.

59:13.984 --> 59:15.851
Hey.

59:17.555 --> 59:21.290
<i> Ho, ho, ho!</i>
<i> Merry christmas.</i>

59:21.392 --> 59:23.158
[knocks]

59:26.297 --> 59:27.829
[exhales deeply]

59:27.932 --> 59:34.069
this was my first time
hosting christmas at my house,

59:34.171 --> 59:36.271
and I tried to make
everything perfect.

59:36.373 --> 59:38.840
Instead, it turned out
to be a total disaster.

59:38.943 --> 59:41.843
I mean, it's...
It's not that bad.

59:43.113 --> 59:44.279
Look.

59:44.381 --> 59:46.815
They...
Broke my closet door.

59:46.917 --> 59:48.984
It just came off
the hinges a little.

59:49.086 --> 59:49.985
I can fix it.

59:50.087 --> 59:51.119
Oh!

59:52.356 --> 59:54.890
Let's see.

1:00:00.898 --> 1:00:02.164
And voila.

1:00:02.266 --> 1:00:03.632
You fixed it.

1:00:03.734 --> 1:00:05.334
Yeah, 'cause it's just stuff.

1:00:05.436 --> 1:00:06.868
Doesn't really mean anything.

1:00:06.971 --> 1:00:08.103
That's what life is like.

1:00:08.205 --> 1:00:09.805
Little bit messy.
Little bit chaotic.

1:00:09.907 --> 1:00:11.773
But that's okay.

1:00:11.875 --> 1:00:14.810
Imagine how dull things would be
if everything was planned.

1:00:14.912 --> 1:00:16.645
-But I-- I like planned.
-Yeah, but sometimes,

1:00:16.747 --> 1:00:19.047
the best things in life
aren't planned.

1:00:21.452 --> 1:00:22.551
What is that on your shirt?

1:00:23.721 --> 1:00:26.021
The baby spat up on me.

1:00:26.123 --> 1:00:27.222
Pretty cute, huh?

1:00:27.324 --> 1:00:28.657
[laughs]

1:00:28.759 --> 1:00:29.791
[laughing harder]
