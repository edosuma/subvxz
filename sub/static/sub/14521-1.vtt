00:07.646 --> 00:10.215
<i>You are my fever</i>

00:10.217 --> 00:14.285
<i>A heat beneath my bones,
I won't escape it</i>

00:14.287 --> 00:17.255
<i>My skin's as thin as
those who've come before</i>

00:17.257 --> 00:21.826
<i>All those that suffer
for the greater good</i>

00:24.263 --> 00:26.698
<i>You are my temptress</i>

00:26.700 --> 00:30.702
<i>Why can't you see that I am working</i>

00:30.704 --> 00:33.938
<i>Stop bothering me</i>

00:33.940 --> 00:38.243
<i>And take the key in case
you need to come back</i>

00:39.845 --> 00:43.281
<i>And I can smell what you're cooking</i>

00:43.283 --> 00:47.419
<i>I'm nearly torn from the moment</i>

00:47.421 --> 00:49.020
<i>By the rattle you make</i>

00:49.022 --> 00:53.158
<i>And I'm walkin' through
feelings that you love me</i>

00:53.160 --> 00:57.662
<i>But just because I can hear you
doesn't mean I can't sleep</i>

00:57.664 --> 01:01.499
<i>And you wanna believe
that you can tempt me</i>

01:01.501 --> 01:03.802
<i>No, no, no</i>

01:05.203 --> 01:07.005
<i>Oh, oh, oh</i>

01:07.007 --> 01:10.008
<i>I don't need it, I can identify</i>

01:10.010 --> 01:14.212
<i>Oh, oh, I'll just break
it as you ought to reply</i>

01:14.214 --> 01:18.283
<i>And you're walking
through feelings</i>

01:18.285 --> 01:22.687
<i>I will remind you that
this body will keep</i>

01:22.689 --> 01:26.891
<i>And I wanna believe
that you can tempt me</i>

01:26.893 --> 01:30.929
<i>And I wanna believe
that you can tempt me</i>

01:30.931 --> 01:34.666
<i>And I wanna believe
that you can tempt me</i>

01:34.668 --> 01:37.168
<i>No, no, no, no</i>

01:40.306 --> 01:44.476
No, you cannot graft the thumbs
of a dead orc onto your paws

01:44.478 --> 01:46.111
Just so you can hold a sword.

01:46.113 --> 01:49.814
Is it not conceivable that I
would have at least a half thumb

01:49.816 --> 01:52.283
From my grandmother's
recessive gene?

01:52.285 --> 01:54.919
Tygraxamus, you can't have a sword.

01:54.921 --> 01:56.640
- This is stupid.
- Weak.

01:56.666 --> 02:00.326
Guys, this bickering is totally
ruining my suspension of disbelief.

02:00.327 --> 02:03.695
I mean, you lure me into a barnyard
of the coveted brain juice

02:03.697 --> 02:06.698
Just to corner me with these
bloodsucking bovines.

02:06.700 --> 02:09.967
And your problem is?

02:11.570 --> 02:14.672
Spontaneously growing appendages
in the middle of the campaign

02:14.674 --> 02:16.774
Disrupts my story's
delicate balance.

02:16.776 --> 02:18.810
Frickin' puss 'n boots
carries a sword.

02:18.812 --> 02:20.845
I warned you months ago
the ills of selecting

02:20.847 --> 02:23.148
A feline digitagrade
as your character.

02:25.618 --> 02:29.420
You're killin' the game, Shadow Hawk.
Clancy, I'll protect you.

02:29.422 --> 02:31.256
We're eatin' veal tonight.
Who's with me?

02:31.258 --> 02:33.958
- I'd follow you anywhere, my liege.
- Epic.

02:33.960 --> 02:36.594
With the song of old, I,
Magmald Teufelschlager,

02:36.596 --> 02:38.596
Will protect you from
their mind control.

02:38.598 --> 02:41.132
- Sing with me.
- Aah...

02:41.134 --> 02:44.435
Voss, you can't do that.
I can't do what?

02:44.437 --> 02:46.604
Sing. You have no vocal cords.

02:46.606 --> 02:50.241
I'm a bardladin, okay? Slaying
and singing is what I do.

02:50.243 --> 02:54.045
You are a wandering phantom
trapped in the astral plane.

02:54.047 --> 02:58.016
You've cut the umbilical cord that
tethered your soul to the mortal world.

02:58.018 --> 03:01.770
- Your body is back at the glen.
- I didn't cut my cord.

03:01.796 --> 03:04.722
- Pat, did I cut my cord?
- No cords were cut.

03:04.724 --> 03:07.158
You tried sharpening
your sword on it.

03:07.160 --> 03:08.326
No, I wasn't.

03:08.328 --> 03:09.727
- Yes.
- No.

03:09.729 --> 03:11.129
- Yes.
- No.

03:11.131 --> 03:13.264
- Yep. Yep.
- No, there was no sharpening.

03:13.266 --> 03:16.034
- Yep. Yep.
- You're having a senior moment!

03:16.036 --> 03:19.270
Personal attacks.
Very mature.

03:19.272 --> 03:21.739
Every time Magmald defies
one of your lame monsters,

03:21.741 --> 03:23.708
Your reap vengeance on
a member of the guild.

03:23.710 --> 03:26.144
And you're creating monsters that don't
even exist in the known universe.

03:26.146 --> 03:28.046
Release Moon-Strider
from the pale ruby.

03:28.048 --> 03:29.847
Let me come down from
the astral plane.

03:29.849 --> 03:31.983
- Give Tygraxamus some thumbs!
- Yeah!

03:31.985 --> 03:34.586
May I remind you, it's "D of D"...

03:34.588 --> 03:37.789
"Dawn of days"... My
game, my creation!

03:37.791 --> 03:41.626
If you don't like it, Voss, Why
don't you go join another guild?!

03:41.628 --> 03:46.064
But stop picking apart my narrative in
some desperate attempt for attention!

03:46.066 --> 03:47.899
Yaahhh!

04:01.580 --> 04:03.581
Three hundred dollars?

04:03.583 --> 04:07.018
Come on, Gary, I can get a couple of
pristine plastic tables for 20 bucks.

04:07.020 --> 04:09.621
Mr. Gary says this is
for punitive damages

04:09.623 --> 04:13.124
For the other times you popped your
lid and scared customers away.

04:13.126 --> 04:15.426
Personally, I think
it's pretty gracious

04:15.428 --> 04:17.262
Considering he could press charges.

04:17.264 --> 04:20.798
Why does he have my sword?
To ensure that Mr. Gary is paid in full.

04:20.800 --> 04:22.834
Or you could take a ride.

04:22.836 --> 04:26.337
Oh, that sucks.

04:26.339 --> 04:29.907
What's worse is he's never
gonna last in prison,

04:29.909 --> 04:32.343
Not with a pretty face like that.

04:32.345 --> 04:34.779
Oh, that's Pat-Pat. I gotta go.

04:34.781 --> 04:39.651
- I'll talk to you later.
- I'll think positive. Tell me what happens.

04:39.653 --> 04:41.085
Oh!

04:41.087 --> 04:43.821
You've been wearing my
magnets. I can tell.

04:43.823 --> 04:47.158
Your complexion is less...

04:47.160 --> 04:48.826
Oily.

04:48.828 --> 04:51.362
Admit it. The therapy works.

04:51.364 --> 04:55.066
Uh, yeah. Thanks for...
letting me use them.

04:56.602 --> 04:58.636
Oh, stay your hand.

04:58.638 --> 05:00.705
Have you tried sleeping with them?

05:00.707 --> 05:04.575
I find my dreams change color
depending on where I place them.

05:09.515 --> 05:12.050
I'm leaving.

05:12.052 --> 05:13.785
Voss.

05:17.123 --> 05:20.458
My freakin' hard drive.
Oh!

05:20.460 --> 05:22.794
Oh, man!

05:24.463 --> 05:25.897
Oh...

05:27.299 --> 05:30.068
So, how was working
with your brother?

05:30.070 --> 05:33.338
I don't know. Maybe it's coming
from the gaming industry

05:33.340 --> 05:37.241
To, uh, food service,
but I can't do it.

05:37.243 --> 05:39.410
You know, they don't
even have benefits?

05:39.412 --> 05:42.347
You're gonna have to get a
job at some point, right?

05:42.349 --> 05:44.549
You can come work at
Digicert with me.

05:44.551 --> 05:49.053
Oh, no, actually, I have my interview
with Warlocks of the Beach,

05:49.055 --> 05:50.755
So...

05:50.757 --> 05:52.623
Warlocks of the...
Of the Beach?

05:52.625 --> 05:55.193
Yeah, that's the one that's
gonna take you to Seattle?

05:55.195 --> 05:57.995
- Yeah.
- And that's... This is a good thing.

05:57.997 --> 06:00.431
This is great... for you.
This is your dream.

06:00.433 --> 06:03.735
Yeah. I'm gonna sell 'em on my new
ideas for that gaming scenario.

06:03.737 --> 06:06.270
I figure it's time for
me to move up, so...

06:07.639 --> 06:09.540
And that's it. Oh...

06:09.542 --> 06:11.609
Um, I'll see ya tomorrow.

06:11.611 --> 06:14.045
You know what? Actually, um,

06:14.047 --> 06:16.347
I have some good news of my own.

06:16.349 --> 06:19.283
Did you know that I've been
dating someone online?

06:19.285 --> 06:20.685
Yeah, I remember.

06:20.687 --> 06:23.054
Oh. You... You do. Okay, well...

06:23.056 --> 06:25.590
I wanted to show you.

06:26.892 --> 06:29.727
His name is Tanick Stormblade.

06:29.729 --> 06:33.331
He's a rogue, huh? Those are
sweet heroic shoulder pads.

06:33.333 --> 06:36.868
Yeah, when we melee together, it's
like we've done so in a former life.

06:36.870 --> 06:41.172
As you can imagine, our
relationship is very special,

06:41.174 --> 06:43.908
And so after months
of online courtship,

06:43.910 --> 06:46.244
I feel his intentions are noble...

06:46.246 --> 06:48.713
And so tomorrow we're
meeting for hoagies.

06:48.715 --> 06:51.249
Sweet. Be careful.

06:51.251 --> 06:52.950
I... I will.

06:52.952 --> 06:55.553
But if he does the same
thing Samantha did...

06:55.555 --> 06:59.223
You and Samantha broke up?

06:59.225 --> 07:04.796
Yeah. She said she wanted
somebody more responsible.

07:06.933 --> 07:10.835
I am...
I'm so sorry about that.

07:10.837 --> 07:13.571
I... I'm so sorry...
to hear that.

07:13.573 --> 07:17.041
- Let's... Do you want to talk about this?
- Nope.

07:17.043 --> 07:20.611
But hey, if Tanick hurts
you, let me know,

07:20.613 --> 07:24.148
I'll find his character
online and kick its ass.

07:27.820 --> 07:30.555
Thank you... Voss.

07:35.427 --> 07:39.163
The most important lesson in life

07:39.165 --> 07:43.134
Is that you are what
you pretend to be.

07:43.136 --> 07:45.870
Did you pull that out
of a fortune cookie?

07:45.872 --> 07:48.606
It's the secret to
surviving this world.

07:48.608 --> 07:51.142
You want to be a knight,
pretend you're a knight

07:51.144 --> 07:54.212
And live by their code
and think like one.

07:54.214 --> 07:57.281
And in the end, you ARE a knight.

07:57.283 --> 08:00.785
Well, I'm just tired
of wasting my life,

08:00.787 --> 08:02.386
Not being productive.

08:02.388 --> 08:07.391
You're not gonna be out
there just, like, doing...

08:45.131 --> 08:46.597
Oh, hey.
Where's Voss?

08:46.599 --> 08:49.500
He's not...
I will break your liver.

09:06.451 --> 09:09.253
You didn't show up
at the taco shop.

09:10.923 --> 09:12.990
Aaah! Clancy!

09:14.928 --> 09:19.330
You said that your unemployment
would help me pay the rent...

09:19.332 --> 09:22.233
Ow!!!! And then you told
me that you'd have a job,

09:22.235 --> 09:25.303
What was that, five,
six months ago?

09:25.305 --> 09:27.338
Ow! Ow!

09:27.340 --> 09:30.041
I'm sensing a pattern here.
I don't like it.

09:30.043 --> 09:33.644
Ow! I have my meeting with
Warlocks at the Beach, all right?!

09:33.646 --> 09:35.846
I'm not going smelling
like a fish taco!

09:35.848 --> 09:39.550
Now, this is a new choke hold I learned
tonight from Jackson the mighty.

09:39.552 --> 09:42.320
It's a ballet of
violence, brother...

09:42.322 --> 09:44.055
A ballet of violence.

09:44.057 --> 09:47.625
Unh! Pliee....
Sashay...

09:47.627 --> 09:49.527
I have my interview tomorrow!

09:49.529 --> 09:51.963
You tellin' me the truth? Yeah?

09:51.965 --> 09:55.366
'Cause if you're lying, then
you're out of here, bro.

09:55.368 --> 09:58.135
Why don't you choke Clancy anymore?

09:58.137 --> 10:02.807
Because Clancy participates,
helps me pay the rent.

10:02.809 --> 10:05.409
And look at him...

10:05.411 --> 10:08.279
Can't handle my rhythm.

10:08.281 --> 10:10.548
Right, Clance?
Yeah.

10:11.783 --> 10:14.952
Yeah... yeah.

10:14.954 --> 10:16.721
Pansy.

10:16.723 --> 10:18.990
I held out for twice that long.

10:18.992 --> 10:20.491
Tapping is for suckers.

10:20.493 --> 10:24.662
What'd you guys eat?
Bok Choy.

10:24.664 --> 10:26.430
Bok Choy?

10:27.633 --> 10:29.800
Hey. Hey, bro.

10:31.036 --> 10:32.370
Hey.

10:32.372 --> 10:33.904
Hey.

10:33.906 --> 10:36.107
Hey. Hey.

10:36.109 --> 10:38.843
Hey, there he is.

10:38.845 --> 10:43.047
Hey...
do you feel all tingly?

10:43.049 --> 10:44.649
Uh-Huh.

10:44.651 --> 10:46.684
I love that.

10:51.157 --> 10:53.190
Yah! Yah!

10:53.192 --> 10:54.892
Yah!

10:58.997 --> 11:00.531
Thanks.

11:21.019 --> 11:24.188
I have to tell you
something serious.

11:29.695 --> 11:32.930
I haven't been honest...

11:32.932 --> 11:34.765
About my feelings.

11:41.306 --> 11:44.642
I'm in love with someone else.

11:48.280 --> 11:49.914
Very real.

11:57.723 --> 12:00.291
Okay. Um, I'm sorry

12:00.293 --> 12:02.960
That I led you on

12:02.962 --> 12:06.397
At the Tavern of the Green Dragon.

12:08.100 --> 12:11.869
It's not you. It's me.

12:11.871 --> 12:14.839
We can still...
fight together,

12:14.841 --> 12:18.309
Just... not as often.

12:20.846 --> 12:23.914
Tanick. Tanick.

12:25.717 --> 12:26.851
Tanick?

12:26.853 --> 12:28.853
Ohh!
Yah!

12:28.855 --> 12:31.222
Tanick?

12:34.860 --> 12:36.427
Tanick?

12:48.473 --> 12:51.208
I'm an awful person.

12:55.647 --> 12:56.847
Hi.

12:56.849 --> 12:59.316
What's wrong?

12:59.318 --> 13:02.019
I want to create a love
interest for Rashanna

13:02.021 --> 13:04.188
To experience for
the duration of this campaign,

13:04.190 --> 13:07.358
And I really like the idea of her
falling in love with your character.

13:07.360 --> 13:08.993
And I've already created
a backstory

13:08.995 --> 13:12.329
How she lost her husband to
a freak white dragon accident

13:12.331 --> 13:14.265
And is now in tremendous
mental turmoil

13:14.267 --> 13:16.233
Because of her sudden rebound,

13:16.235 --> 13:17.735
So she's very vulnerable

13:17.737 --> 13:20.638
And she needs somebody
to protect her.

13:21.540 --> 13:24.875
But Magmald went celibate.

13:26.278 --> 13:29.346
We can work around that.

13:33.318 --> 13:35.452
Handwritten resumé.

13:35.454 --> 13:38.756
Never seen one in calligraphy.

13:38.758 --> 13:40.491
Thanks.

13:42.093 --> 13:46.997
You realize this job requires you to
move to our headquarters in Seattle?

13:46.999 --> 13:49.033
I'm not at liberty to tell you
too much about the project

13:49.035 --> 13:52.436
Other than it's an A.R.G.,
Alternative Reality Game,

13:52.438 --> 13:56.106
- A blend of online and offline gaming.
- Epic.

13:56.108 --> 13:58.809
The game director position
is not gonna be an easy one.

13:58.811 --> 14:01.979
You are gonna have to
manage a team of over 15 people

14:01.981 --> 14:05.783
And... I'm not seeing
anything on your resumé.

14:07.085 --> 14:10.254
Look, I'm, uh, I'm the
leader of a... of a guild.

14:10.256 --> 14:12.456
My main character
actually has a full set

14:12.458 --> 14:14.558
- Of fifth tier heroic level-
- Yeah.

14:14.560 --> 14:16.927
- I've also spent more than 3900 hours...
- Look...

14:16.929 --> 14:18.963
I've seen over 50 people
for this position,

14:18.965 --> 14:21.565
And they're all saying the same
thing over and over again.

14:21.567 --> 14:24.301
- Tier five...
- If you want this job,

14:24.303 --> 14:28.105
You need to stand out and prove to
me that you're the complete package.

14:28.107 --> 14:30.341
Gamer? Yeah.

14:30.343 --> 14:32.643
Leader...?

14:35.146 --> 14:37.114
I can lead people, sir.

14:37.116 --> 14:39.884
Look, I'm not gonna make a
decision for another week.

14:39.886 --> 14:41.886
Can you put together something
in the next day or two

14:41.888 --> 14:44.288
That will prove to me
that you can lead people?

14:44.290 --> 14:47.558
Yeah.

14:47.560 --> 14:50.394
I look forward to seeing
what you bring back.

14:50.396 --> 14:52.963
Me too.

15:00.805 --> 15:02.973
Why can't I do that?

15:02.975 --> 15:04.520
It doesn't make any sense.

15:04.546 --> 15:05.910
Why can't I go through
the high plains pass?

15:05.912 --> 15:09.754
Voss, it's your brother! You were
supposed to be here 17 minutes ago!

15:09.780 --> 15:12.283
Where are you?! If you are
not here in five minutes,

15:12.285 --> 15:14.852
I swear to you
I am doubling your rent,

15:14.854 --> 15:17.454
And if I see you,
I will choke you out!

15:17.456 --> 15:20.524
- It wasn't snowing.
- What the hell are you talkin' about?!

15:20.526 --> 15:22.593
You said it was fall, not winter!

15:22.595 --> 15:24.695
Well, let's see. The turtlebuds
haven't bloomed yet,

15:24.697 --> 15:27.998
All the rabbits have gone south,
ss well as the plains wolves,

15:28.000 --> 15:30.000
Which is the only food source
for the Beast Lord.

15:30.002 --> 15:33.203
So that would make it, I think...
Uh, yeah... Winter.

15:33.205 --> 15:34.471
It's bullcrap.

15:34.473 --> 15:36.106
Bullcrap! Right?

15:36.108 --> 15:38.208
- Right? Am I right?
- Hi.

15:38.210 --> 15:40.010
Right? Right? Yeah!

15:40.012 --> 15:42.479
Come on, fantasy pants,
what are you gonna change now?

15:42.481 --> 15:45.683
I'm incredibly unsatisfied with the
particular inconsistencies of this game.

15:45.685 --> 15:47.017
I'm just sayin'.

15:51.023 --> 15:53.924
I have a vote I'd like to
bring before the guild.

15:53.926 --> 15:56.527
I have a lot of friends that
would like to join this game,

15:56.529 --> 15:58.762
But unfortunately,
it sucks three things:

15:58.764 --> 16:00.898
Turkey balls, troll, and ass.

16:00.900 --> 16:04.034
I would like to propose that
I become the new game master

16:04.036 --> 16:05.869
And manage
the rest of this campaign.

16:05.871 --> 16:07.604
I can promise you by next friday

16:07.606 --> 16:09.606
We'll have at least
a dozen new people involved.

16:09.608 --> 16:11.275
That includes healers.

16:11.277 --> 16:12.676
Who agrees?

16:14.079 --> 16:17.081
It's settled, then.
I'll run the guild this week.

16:17.083 --> 16:19.550
This is my campaign.

16:19.552 --> 16:21.418
No, it's not!
We took a vote!

16:21.420 --> 16:23.053
Voss!

16:24.489 --> 16:28.058
It's the role-Playing.
My character's a barbarian,

16:28.060 --> 16:29.560
Has some control issues.

16:29.562 --> 16:31.528
Thanks.

16:33.331 --> 16:35.733
Well...

16:35.735 --> 16:39.570
I think I could give it a go
under one condition:

16:39.572 --> 16:41.739
That you...

16:45.810 --> 16:49.079
Destroy... the Beast Lord.

17:02.193 --> 17:03.594
Bring it, weak sauce.

17:03.596 --> 17:06.597
And if you lose, Magmald dies,

17:06.598 --> 17:08.198
Never to be resurrected,

17:08.200 --> 17:12.236
And you have to leave
the guild forever.

17:12.238 --> 17:14.637
Don't do it.
Don't do it.

17:14.640 --> 17:16.306
Don't do it.
Let's do it.

17:16.308 --> 17:17.974
Fine. Do it.

17:21.646 --> 17:24.948
I cast righteous indignation.

17:24.950 --> 17:27.951
That's a 15-Foot barrier of
protection against projectiles.

17:27.953 --> 17:30.621
I'll also be drinking
my potion of bull strength.

17:30.623 --> 17:32.890
Don't forget fire.
Resistance to fire.

17:37.930 --> 17:41.065
I come down from
the astral plane...

17:41.067 --> 17:42.733
Which I was never in...

17:42.735 --> 17:44.868
Ah ah... Ah...

17:44.870 --> 17:46.870
And raise my sword to heronius,

17:46.872 --> 17:49.673
Adding plus-Three
to my hit and damage.

17:49.675 --> 17:51.308
Yes, yes, yes.
Well...

17:52.610 --> 17:54.945
That's... pretty hot stuff.

17:54.947 --> 17:58.515
Why don't you roll a saving throw

17:58.517 --> 18:01.919
Against the Beast Lord's psyonic
death stare while you're at it?

18:01.921 --> 18:05.389
Come on, man! When did the
Beast Lord get psyonics?!

18:05.391 --> 18:08.592
When he was a baby Beast Lord?

18:11.764 --> 18:14.298
Whatever. Let's do this.

18:22.440 --> 18:24.174
A critical failure.

18:24.176 --> 18:29.046
Unless you roll something greater
than eight, you will die.

18:30.215 --> 18:32.783
Thank you.

18:37.455 --> 18:39.089
Five, five, five, five, five.

19:01.412 --> 19:04.748
Well...
the dice don't lie.

19:13.725 --> 19:15.325
It's just a game.

19:28.806 --> 19:31.241
What, your pegasus get ringworm?

19:31.243 --> 19:33.911
Have to be put down?

19:33.913 --> 19:35.746
Shut up.

20:06.644 --> 20:09.279
Heronius!

20:18.623 --> 20:19.623
Ahh....

20:22.828 --> 20:26.163
Ahhhhhh....

20:27.465 --> 20:32.035
Aaaaaahhh....

21:35.767 --> 21:38.969
I was born in the wrong universe.

21:53.785 --> 21:57.187
Phhht. That...

21:57.189 --> 21:59.356
Was horrible.

21:59.358 --> 22:04.795
This is a play about
forbidden love.

22:04.797 --> 22:07.331
It's in the words.

22:08.333 --> 22:11.368
Feel it in your loins.

22:11.370 --> 22:12.736
Yes, sir.

22:12.738 --> 22:15.172
Let's try again, shall we?
Yes, sir.

22:15.174 --> 22:18.108
Okay. Places.
Okay, yeah.

22:21.612 --> 22:22.879
Action.

22:30.221 --> 22:31.088
Unh!

22:31.090 --> 22:33.957
Four ages shall pass...

22:33.959 --> 22:36.026
But I will be patient...

22:36.028 --> 22:38.428
Hoping for the day

22:38.430 --> 22:41.932
When I shall again see you
face-To-Face...

22:41.934 --> 22:44.768
My darling little sushi roll.

22:44.770 --> 22:46.236
Our love shall be

22:46.238 --> 22:49.239
Like a disgraced samurai...
yes? What?

22:49.241 --> 22:52.242
Impaled with his own sword.
Oh.

22:52.244 --> 22:54.678
Well... Everyone out.

22:54.680 --> 22:56.580
Off the stage! Let's go.

23:00.418 --> 23:02.052
Hmm.

23:04.156 --> 23:07.424
Of all the invitations
I've given you,

23:07.426 --> 23:09.960
For what reason do you grace
this pleasant stage?

23:09.962 --> 23:11.895
After we find the brain juice,

23:11.897 --> 23:14.731
What if Rashanna goes
to the hills of monyar

23:14.733 --> 23:17.300
And finds a rod of resurrection
to bring Magmald back?

23:17.302 --> 23:20.203
That would divert too much
attention from the narrative.

23:20.205 --> 23:23.473
More important than
Voss's tattered ego

23:23.475 --> 23:25.909
Is that you've come
to see my play.

23:25.911 --> 23:28.512
It's an unlikely love story

23:28.514 --> 23:30.547
About a woman...

23:30.549 --> 23:33.750
Who loves a man.

23:33.752 --> 23:37.988
Is there... Is there anything
that the guild can do for Voss?

23:37.990 --> 23:43.560
The only ointment for someone feeling
sorry for themselves, my darling,

23:43.562 --> 23:47.497
Is to help them realize
that they suck.

24:00.411 --> 24:03.747
Morning, sunshine. What
happened with that interview?

24:03.749 --> 24:07.150
It's really close
between me and one other guy.

24:07.152 --> 24:11.121
I got you set up monday morning.
Taco shop. Be there.

24:14.926 --> 24:16.426
It's Marsha.

24:18.429 --> 24:19.529
Sorry.

24:26.170 --> 24:27.257
Hey, Marsha.

24:27.283 --> 24:30.332
Would you like to come over
for breakfast chicken?

24:32.276 --> 24:34.110
Hello.

24:36.581 --> 24:39.149
I made you something.

24:41.652 --> 24:45.255
It's a cape, and, uh,
it has flannel on the inside

24:45.257 --> 24:48.725
So it can double as a blanket
and keep you warm.

24:48.727 --> 24:51.261
Oh. Thank you,
Marsha.

24:51.263 --> 24:52.696
Absolutely.

24:56.234 --> 24:57.701
Oh, wow.

24:59.504 --> 25:01.071
Clancy.

25:01.073 --> 25:02.405
He's... total...

25:02.407 --> 25:06.042
He's here. This is so
unexpectedly awesome.

25:06.044 --> 25:08.912
This is so great.

25:08.914 --> 25:11.548
That's a pretty dress.
Thanks.

25:18.256 --> 25:19.489
Mmm.

26:23.487 --> 26:29.259
I think that we should start
our very own campaign.

26:29.261 --> 26:32.429
Um, I was mulling some story
points around just this morning.

26:32.431 --> 26:35.332
"a wicked hobgoblin king

26:35.334 --> 26:37.434
"Enslaves a village
of egg-Laying gnomes,

26:37.436 --> 26:40.704
Forcing them to hard labor
and into the swamps."

26:40.706 --> 26:44.040
I mean, I could see our
combined sacrifice to save them

26:44.042 --> 26:47.611
As being just shy of legendary.

26:47.613 --> 26:50.547
And also, the...

26:50.549 --> 26:54.117
Love interest idea, which I
mentioned the other day,

26:54.119 --> 26:56.586
Between Magmald and Rashanna...

26:56.588 --> 26:59.522
Could easily be folded
into this plot line,

26:59.524 --> 27:02.058
Which I think is necessary.

27:02.060 --> 27:06.229
I don't get what a surface-Dwelling
hobgoblin has to do with the svirfneblin.

27:06.231 --> 27:08.198
I'm glad you said something.

27:08.200 --> 27:11.167
I think Clancy's just
trying to say that

27:11.169 --> 27:14.037
You can't up and willy-Nilly
a campaign together.

27:14.039 --> 27:17.340
I know. I mean, right. I...
I guess I was just thinking

27:17.342 --> 27:20.577
That the entire guild
would abandon Shadow Hawk if...

27:20.579 --> 27:24.280
If they knew that you were
creating your own new guild.

27:24.282 --> 27:26.850
I mean, they've always trusted
your leadership in the game,

27:26.852 --> 27:29.119
so why wouldn't they
trust you in real life?

27:29.121 --> 27:31.054
But that's stupid.

27:31.056 --> 27:34.758
It's for monkey brains, and...

27:34.760 --> 27:38.328
unless...

27:56.414 --> 27:57.814
What?

27:57.816 --> 28:00.450
Do you need the Heimlich?

28:27.445 --> 28:28.912
Magmald.

28:39.490 --> 28:42.792
Yeah. Uh-Huh, yeah.
Yeah? Okay!

28:42.794 --> 28:44.661
Explain.

28:44.663 --> 28:47.764
I figured out how I'm gonna
get the job at warlock.

28:47.766 --> 28:51.568
I'm gonna create a land
of magic and wonder.

28:51.570 --> 28:55.405
I'm gonna show 'em how I can
handle a group of six or...

28:55.407 --> 29:00.477
Sixteen people in
an out-Of-The-Box kind of way.

29:00.479 --> 29:01.544
Awesome!

29:01.546 --> 29:03.213
And I need you to
document everything.

29:03.215 --> 29:05.815
I need you to take notes
and... And film...

29:05.817 --> 29:07.684
O-Okay. I'll get the guild
on the phone,

29:07.686 --> 29:10.920
- I'll tell 'em exactly what we're doing.
- I love that. No, I hate that.

29:10.922 --> 29:13.089
Because they can't know
I'm doing it for a job,

29:13.091 --> 29:14.724
- They won't be themselves.
- Oh, right.

29:14.726 --> 29:18.561
So I have to tell them... what, then?

29:21.432 --> 29:24.734
I'm creating a utopia for gamers.

29:24.736 --> 29:27.270
Oh, I love that.

29:27.272 --> 29:29.973
Excellent. Call the guild.

29:29.975 --> 29:31.674
Yeah.

29:37.182 --> 29:39.449
- What up, doc?
- Hold for Voss.

29:39.451 --> 29:41.519
Oh, hey, Marsh. What's up?

29:42.521 --> 29:44.554
Patty melt! What's up, buddy?

29:44.556 --> 29:46.756
Angie and I are just
biting into frozen yogurt.

29:46.758 --> 29:52.028
Uh, yeah, I need you to meet me
at the corner of state and fourth

29:52.030 --> 29:54.631
With your tent, your gear,
and Angie.

29:54.633 --> 29:57.801
Why? What for, man?
Just do it! Doesn't matter why.

30:00.172 --> 30:02.372
Why didn't you guys wait for me?

30:08.612 --> 30:11.414
Waffle and wok, this is Rhubarb.
Rhubarb,

30:11.416 --> 30:15.151
I got somethin' big, something epic going
on, ginormous. I'm gonna need you.

30:15.153 --> 30:16.586
What's goin' down?

30:18.522 --> 30:21.691
Hello? Dude, I can't play
on the phone.

30:21.693 --> 30:23.092
I gotta clean...

30:23.094 --> 30:24.694
I don't want to!

30:24.696 --> 30:27.730
And I got customers.
Who is that?

30:28.966 --> 30:30.466
Who's with you?

30:30.468 --> 30:32.035
You're breakin' up.

30:32.037 --> 30:34.437
No, uh, I distinctly heard
somebody in the background.

30:34.439 --> 30:36.472
Come again?
It's Shadow Hawk, isn't it?

30:36.474 --> 30:37.640
You got a crappy phone.

30:37.642 --> 30:38.908
You're hanging with sh...
Hello?

30:38.910 --> 30:40.143
I'm losing you, man.

30:40.145 --> 30:42.812
Well, he's not invited,
so ditch him.

30:45.716 --> 30:47.851
No, really.

30:47.853 --> 30:49.652
Who is that?

30:49.654 --> 30:53.356
I totally forgot I volunteered
to help this old lady

30:53.358 --> 30:56.726
Who lost some toes in a battle...

30:56.728 --> 30:59.028
With diabetes?

30:59.030 --> 31:00.830
It's sad.

31:05.135 --> 31:07.704
I gotta go. Text me.

31:14.812 --> 31:16.079
Ohh!

32:06.397 --> 32:09.499
I'm gonna change
and get my stuff, okay?

32:12.069 --> 32:13.469
Check it.

32:13.471 --> 32:17.407
It sought me out.
It's my holy avenger.

32:21.045 --> 32:23.146
Open the back.

32:23.148 --> 32:24.547
Do it.

32:52.510 --> 32:54.677
Dude, where's Clancy going?

32:54.679 --> 32:56.446
And where's your outfit, man?

32:56.448 --> 32:59.716
Don't worry about it, Pat man,
all right? Taking care of business.

32:59.718 --> 33:01.784
My mom wants me back by seven.

33:01.786 --> 33:04.787
Hey, where we're going,
you don't need a mom.

33:04.789 --> 33:07.924
Sweet.
You gettin' this?

33:09.259 --> 33:11.260
Wait. Wait.

33:11.262 --> 33:13.696
That's it, nice, slow pan,

33:13.698 --> 33:16.199
Okay, into the zoom,
just a single...

33:21.405 --> 33:24.040
So get on this harp

33:24.042 --> 33:26.009
And get on the sun

33:26.011 --> 33:30.680
Get on this train and watch it roll

33:32.549 --> 33:36.252
Downhill, downhill, downhill

33:39.490 --> 33:44.160
You're losing your life,
you're losing control

33:44.162 --> 33:48.031
You're losing your brain
with the rock and roll...

33:48.033 --> 33:50.233
You have just entered a new realm.

33:50.235 --> 33:55.038
You are now quite literally
your characters.

33:55.040 --> 33:57.707
You will act like your characters,

33:57.709 --> 34:00.610
You will be your characters,

34:00.612 --> 34:04.647
And through them,
we shall create a utopia.

34:07.785 --> 34:10.018
You are now in unk-Tar town,

34:10.021 --> 34:13.822
A small fishing village on the
shores of the deserted sea.

34:13.824 --> 34:18.561
Carrion birds circle above...

34:18.563 --> 34:21.496
And then we look down.

34:21.498 --> 34:24.667
We are standing among
what appears to be

34:24.668 --> 34:26.702
Two dozen human remains.

34:26.704 --> 34:30.907
Their intestines scattered,
holes in their skulls,

34:30.909 --> 34:34.811
And black scarring on their faces.

34:34.813 --> 34:37.847
Infamous skull ciphers.

34:39.882 --> 34:42.485
Yahhh!!!

34:42.487 --> 34:43.585
Ohh!

34:45.322 --> 34:47.223
Yahhh!

34:47.225 --> 34:48.690
Yahhh!

34:51.328 --> 34:53.362
Now.

35:00.504 --> 35:02.572
Ohh! Whoa!

35:06.877 --> 35:08.277
Whoa.

35:09.613 --> 35:11.147
Arm yourselves!

35:11.149 --> 35:12.315
Form up!

35:22.392 --> 35:25.595
You primordial maggot pukes!

35:25.597 --> 35:30.900
It was foolish of you to think
that you could claim my spoils.

35:30.902 --> 35:34.270
Now I shall devour you!

35:38.342 --> 35:41.377
Charge!!!

35:49.820 --> 35:53.856
I'm hit! Kill me! Kill me!

35:53.858 --> 35:56.692
Bring everything with you.
Oh!

35:56.694 --> 36:00.096
Come on, get in there!
Kill! Kill!

36:02.733 --> 36:04.967
- Come on, everybody! Focus!
- Whoo!

36:04.969 --> 36:08.304
Insolent wimps, all of you!
Go for the lips!

36:12.510 --> 36:15.378
Nerf gun!
Don't! Ohh! Crap!

36:15.380 --> 36:17.713
Split up!

36:18.982 --> 36:20.917
That's it!
Together now!

36:20.919 --> 36:22.318
Dang it.

36:23.453 --> 36:25.054
Hyahh!

36:25.056 --> 36:27.056
Go for the lips!

36:27.058 --> 36:28.224
Aaah!

36:30.494 --> 36:32.328
The assassin!

36:32.330 --> 36:34.463
No! No!!!

36:34.465 --> 36:37.166
I'll take 40 acid damage, Marsha.

36:41.638 --> 36:43.806
Everybody fall back!

36:44.875 --> 36:47.476
Launch the magic missile!

36:47.478 --> 36:49.212
Magic missile...
Not yet!

36:50.347 --> 36:53.216
Now!
Magic missile!

37:09.666 --> 37:13.169
We are no longer
heroes of the imagination.

37:13.171 --> 37:16.839
We are taking this adventure
to the next level.

37:16.841 --> 37:19.175
Tell everyone you know.

37:19.177 --> 37:23.145
And welcome...
to unicorn city.

37:33.323 --> 37:36.659
This is it.
This is everybody we know?

37:36.661 --> 37:38.461
Where's Gary and trevor?

37:38.463 --> 37:40.830
Um, well, Gary had jury duty,

37:40.832 --> 37:44.467
And trevor's mom said
that our camp is satanic.

37:44.469 --> 37:46.535
So...

37:46.537 --> 37:48.471
whatever.

37:51.708 --> 37:53.776
Hold, please.

37:55.512 --> 37:58.414
Next.
Name and former life?

37:59.816 --> 38:04.420
Hi. My name is kathy.
I work in whole foods.

38:04.422 --> 38:06.489
My character's name is Tearsumina,

38:06.491 --> 38:10.293
And my powers are somewhere
in the field of... seduction.

38:12.029 --> 38:14.997
You're a succubus, huh?

38:16.366 --> 38:20.236
Should we be inviting
evil into the camp?

38:25.310 --> 38:26.976
Welcome.

38:29.713 --> 38:31.847
Hold.

39:18.462 --> 39:20.796
Once you go centaur...

39:20.798 --> 39:22.832
Yeah, we know.

39:44.654 --> 39:46.555
Aah.

39:51.395 --> 39:54.597
What took you so long?
Nice map, ace.

39:54.599 --> 39:57.967
Listen, I had trouble with the chassis.
I had to go to the store.

39:57.969 --> 40:01.237
Someone followed me.
Shadow Hawk.

40:03.540 --> 40:06.409
A-N-T, baby,
a-N-T.

40:06.411 --> 40:08.043
"Ant"?

40:08.045 --> 40:10.346
"Ain't no thing."

40:10.348 --> 40:13.682
Circled back, lost him in,
like, women's apparel

40:13.684 --> 40:15.918
Or canned foods.

40:18.790 --> 40:21.524
You gotta trust the ruby, baby.

40:21.526 --> 40:24.059
We're all good. So what's
the haps out here?

40:24.061 --> 40:26.662
We gonna party or what?

40:35.172 --> 40:37.239
Congregate, get together,

40:37.241 --> 40:39.675
Gather up.

40:39.677 --> 40:41.277
Everyone's together,

40:41.279 --> 40:43.879
But I've already received
eight complaints about...

40:43.881 --> 40:47.216
Quargooz's codpiece, and...
Okay, I could see it.

40:47.218 --> 40:49.452
I'm gonna go ahead and take
care of that in private.

40:49.454 --> 40:51.787
Thank you.

40:51.789 --> 40:53.322
Okay. Um...

40:53.324 --> 40:56.292
Before we send out the npcs...

40:56.294 --> 40:59.862
I have some business
to take care of.

41:01.933 --> 41:05.134
Rhubarb.
I'm listening.

41:05.136 --> 41:09.705
I think we all learned some
things from the treasure hunt....

41:09.707 --> 41:13.943
And now it's time to
take things to the next level.

41:20.417 --> 41:24.687
Unicorn city is an intricate web of
equal opportunity disciplines and rules

41:24.689 --> 41:27.823
Based on an extremely fair
role-Playing system.

41:27.825 --> 41:31.293
You can find these rules on page
four of your citizenship manual.

41:31.295 --> 41:35.698
You will also see that there is an area for
you to draw a picture of your character...

41:35.700 --> 41:39.635
Which Marsha will evaluate at a later
time for possible experience points.

41:39.637 --> 41:42.304
You can also show your support
for unicorn city

41:42.306 --> 41:44.573
Through a tax-Deductible pledge.

41:44.575 --> 41:50.546
And Voss, I would like to donate,
to unicorn city, a dollar.

41:50.548 --> 41:55.150
Oh, my gosh, Marsha, now we
know how much it means to you.

42:01.526 --> 42:05.828
Make sure that gets
all the way around.

42:05.830 --> 42:10.065
Our first order of action is to see
how well you handle my leadership

42:10.067 --> 42:12.268
Under a threat level of one.

42:12.270 --> 42:16.105
This shouldn't be too difficult,
people, so let's stay focused.

42:25.715 --> 42:28.651
Friend of the forest!
What's wrong?

42:28.653 --> 42:30.352
It was terrible, terrible.

42:30.354 --> 42:32.354
It moved so fast we never saw it.

42:32.356 --> 42:35.958
Oh, my wife and children.
Oh, the carnage.

42:35.960 --> 42:38.093
We shall avenge your pain.

42:38.095 --> 42:42.097
Everyone find your buddy.
Move out calmly.

42:45.502 --> 42:47.870
Stay in a nice orderly fashion.

42:47.872 --> 42:49.572
Since I've submitted
to all of this,

42:49.574 --> 42:52.975
Will you be my buddy?
Yeah, sure.

42:52.977 --> 42:54.710
Who took the dollar?!

42:54.712 --> 42:57.713
Hey, Voss,
will you deduct XP if I stay?

42:57.715 --> 42:59.715
You will not lose
any experience points.

42:59.717 --> 43:02.851
In face, I will award you 200
points regarding the encampment

43:02.853 --> 43:05.387
And any trash you might pick up.

43:07.090 --> 43:08.691
Let's do this!

43:22.539 --> 43:23.973
Meow!

43:23.975 --> 43:26.709
Mmm! Mmm!

43:52.402 --> 43:53.669
Go!

43:55.605 --> 43:57.439
Arggh!
Down!

44:03.780 --> 44:07.583
This is so exciting!

44:07.585 --> 44:09.485
Totally.

44:09.487 --> 44:10.619
Aaaah!

44:14.491 --> 44:15.658
Sorry.

44:16.861 --> 44:18.794
I guess I tripped.

44:18.796 --> 44:20.829
Marsha, are you crazy?

44:20.831 --> 44:22.631
She needs some room.

44:24.401 --> 44:26.135
Come on.

44:28.538 --> 44:30.973
As bardladin I sing,

44:30.975 --> 44:34.109
Life, back to your life

44:34.111 --> 44:37.246
Spirit back to its shell

44:37.248 --> 44:39.948
Tearsumina

44:39.950 --> 44:43.252
Be you well

44:43.254 --> 44:45.621
okay.

44:45.623 --> 44:49.958
Somebody cast a spell to offset
the temporary effects of death.

44:49.960 --> 44:52.561
Bzzzzt.
This was a failure.

44:52.563 --> 44:55.497
Clodnar, contact the mpcs.

44:55.499 --> 44:58.567
We're returning to camp.

44:58.569 --> 45:01.370
"in rural areas, automobiles...

45:01.372 --> 45:03.839
- Kill more deer than hunters."
- False!

45:03.841 --> 45:04.701
Why?

45:04.727 --> 45:08.143
Because that sentence is an
example of a dangling modifier.

45:08.145 --> 45:10.779
- Ten out of ten on grammar.
- Yes!

45:10.781 --> 45:14.616
With my default student loan status
cleared up, I'm in this time!

45:14.618 --> 45:18.120
The highway patrol will be
compelled to have me!

45:18.122 --> 45:19.922
Bogie! 12 o'clock!

45:19.924 --> 45:22.165
Eleven o'clock, ten o'clock,
nine o'clock, eight o'clock!

45:38.174 --> 45:40.008
You see that?
Saw it.

45:40.010 --> 45:41.577
What are you doing out here?

45:41.579 --> 45:46.048
Nothing. I'm not doing anything.
Just... Just walking.

45:46.050 --> 45:48.851
Are you alone?

45:48.853 --> 45:50.719
Just me.

46:01.698 --> 46:03.899
Mooners?

46:09.806 --> 46:11.373
Mooners!

46:15.779 --> 46:17.312
Um, I'm positive,

46:17.314 --> 46:20.516
I'm pretty sure, that
Moon-Strider is missing.

46:23.186 --> 46:25.487
Moon-Strider!

46:28.358 --> 46:31.393
I need a tracker!

46:32.295 --> 46:34.630
Yeah.

46:34.632 --> 46:37.699
Moon-Strider
is missing.

46:37.701 --> 46:39.601
I'm on it.

46:51.281 --> 46:55.017
Great. I have lost
a 25-Year-Old german.

46:56.287 --> 46:59.054
Please don't make note of that.

47:01.357 --> 47:03.892
These are Moon-Strider's
prints all right,

47:03.894 --> 47:06.128
But there's two other
sets over there.

47:06.130 --> 47:09.198
Which means he pansied out and his
mom and dad came and got him.

47:09.200 --> 47:09.967
What a wuss.

47:09.993 --> 47:13.035
And what, left his allegiance
cards back at camp?

47:13.037 --> 47:14.188
I don't think so.

47:14.214 --> 47:16.431
Okay, so then he was abducted?

47:23.279 --> 47:27.049
It was the same cops that
took your sword at hastur's.

47:27.051 --> 47:30.452
- And then what?
- I have to pay $150 for loitering.

47:30.454 --> 47:32.554
My mother's gonna kill me.

47:32.556 --> 47:34.556
Do they know
the rest of us are here?

47:34.558 --> 47:37.793
No, because... I lied.

47:39.863 --> 47:41.463
It was a noble lie.

47:41.465 --> 47:44.053
One hundred experience points
for Moon-Strider's lie.

47:44.079 --> 47:44.700
You got it.

47:44.702 --> 47:48.270
- Okay, I think we should move the camp.
- No, all we need is surveillance.

47:48.272 --> 47:51.573
Okay, that's what we're gonna do.
"Surveillance."

47:51.575 --> 47:53.575
Who has night vision?

47:53.577 --> 47:55.711
How powerful is it?

47:55.713 --> 47:58.413
Okay. Yeah, that's great.

48:00.316 --> 48:02.451
Okay, listen to me.

48:02.453 --> 48:06.788
One blow for "danger,"
two blows for "all clear."

48:06.790 --> 48:08.690
Fly!

48:11.394 --> 48:13.662
We are screwed.

48:13.664 --> 48:15.230
Did you just see how he ran?

48:15.232 --> 48:18.567
That was... I've never seen
anything like that, really.

48:24.607 --> 48:26.008
I guess... I just...

48:26.010 --> 48:27.643
I don't know exactly what it is,

48:27.645 --> 48:31.113
I mean, I know this city
means everything to him,

48:31.115 --> 48:33.282
And he's got that job,
and he's gonna...

48:33.284 --> 48:36.818
I get that...
What job?

48:36.820 --> 48:39.187
Um... the job where...

48:39.189 --> 48:42.824
The job... The job where he's the
leader of this... This camp.

48:44.060 --> 48:46.194
Oh. Yeah.

48:46.196 --> 48:50.399
I'm just saying, I feel like I should
quit because he doesn't need me.

48:50.401 --> 48:53.902
Ohh. Marsha, why are you
always, "unhh," every time?

48:53.904 --> 48:56.605
- I don't "unhh" every time.
- Yes, you do.

48:56.607 --> 48:58.774
You just need to get out
of your comfort zone

48:58.776 --> 49:00.842
And you need to do something risky.

49:00.844 --> 49:02.477
Unhh.

49:02.479 --> 49:05.681
Do you even really
want to be with him?

49:05.683 --> 49:09.084
- Then do you trust me?
- Yeah.

49:09.086 --> 49:13.422
Okay. Are you willing to do
exactly what I tell you to do?

49:15.725 --> 49:17.526
Yes.

49:18.995 --> 49:21.897
Okay.

49:41.384 --> 49:42.918
Ahem.

49:42.920 --> 49:44.953
It has been brought
to my attention

49:44.955 --> 49:47.489
That while Rhubarb was out in the
trees taking care of business,

49:47.491 --> 49:52.461
Someone took his better half for a
little joyride and flattened a tire.

49:52.463 --> 49:55.330
Shame on you.

49:55.332 --> 49:58.467
Shame. On. You.

49:58.469 --> 50:01.203
On page three of your
manuals, it clearly states

50:01.205 --> 50:02.704
unless you are a thief

50:02.706 --> 50:05.307
Or have at least
seven thieving skill points,

50:05.309 --> 50:07.109
You are not allowed to steal.

50:07.111 --> 50:09.745
If you are caught doing so,
you will be sent home.

50:09.747 --> 50:14.049
We are not the undead, people,
so let's not act like it.

50:14.051 --> 50:15.717
Thanks.

51:11.107 --> 51:13.608
Whoo!
Ugh.

51:16.245 --> 51:18.747
Yeah!
Whoo!

51:24.821 --> 51:26.021
Yeah!

51:34.163 --> 51:38.369
- That was so stupid!
- No, no, it was amazing! You did so great.

51:38.395 --> 51:42.003
- I'm definitely leaving now.
- Did you even see yourself?

51:42.005 --> 51:45.140
Okay, so Voss is coming. Just be
mean. Tell him that you hate him.

51:45.166 --> 51:48.777
What? What? Oh, my gosh.

51:55.151 --> 51:57.552
Hey, that was, um...

51:57.554 --> 52:00.622
It was really... different.

52:00.624 --> 52:04.426
Did, uh, did Angie
put you up to that?

52:04.428 --> 52:06.695
Oh. Hey, Voss.

52:07.730 --> 52:11.233
Um, so, quargooz
called his cousins,

52:11.235 --> 52:14.469
And we're gonna have, like, a
huge influx of gamers tomorrow.

52:14.471 --> 52:17.539
I thought maybe you knew
somebody who knew somebody

52:17.541 --> 52:23.178
That knew someone that worked at
one of the news stations maybe?

52:23.180 --> 52:25.480
Yeah. Mm-Hmm. Maybe.

52:25.482 --> 52:28.550
I mean, I don't know.
Whatever.

52:28.552 --> 52:30.385
Okay, cool.

52:31.888 --> 52:35.190
I broke up with Tanick Stormblade.

52:37.160 --> 52:39.694
Um... sorry.

52:39.696 --> 52:41.496
I'm not.

52:41.498 --> 52:45.700
Okay. Um, look,
it's...

52:45.702 --> 52:47.202
It's freezing.

52:47.204 --> 52:50.272
Why don't you come back
to the fire?

53:10.593 --> 53:12.260
I'm sorry.

53:12.262 --> 53:15.297
No, I... Yeah, I'm sorry.
That was stupid.

53:15.299 --> 53:18.300
That was my bad.
I don't even know...

53:18.302 --> 53:20.302
- You okay?
- Sorry!

53:31.581 --> 53:34.049
I'm an idiot.

54:18.828 --> 54:20.495
- How do I look?
- Great.

54:20.497 --> 54:23.098
Um, Pat was asking about
a meal plan. I don't know...

54:23.100 --> 54:26.701
I need you to stand right about here.
Get a picture of me shaking their hands.

54:26.703 --> 54:28.403
You got it.

54:32.008 --> 54:36.111
So I hear you two were
kissing last night.

54:39.315 --> 54:40.982
Oh... sorry.

54:40.984 --> 54:45.453
It's okay. Welcome to unicorn city.

54:45.455 --> 54:48.056
Ah, yes. Unicrap city.

54:48.058 --> 54:50.925
Hmm. Looks just like the brochure.

54:50.927 --> 54:53.962
What are you doing here? Hmm?

55:00.002 --> 55:02.537
Shadow Hawk looks like a pimp.

55:05.374 --> 55:07.642
Did you tell him what
I was doing out here?

55:07.644 --> 55:09.077
No. No, of course not.

55:09.079 --> 55:12.380
Ah... the land.

55:12.382 --> 55:14.182
Where's Rhubarb?

55:14.184 --> 55:17.519
Is anybody hungry? We have
flapjacks on the grill!

55:17.521 --> 55:20.555
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Where do you
think you're going, clodnar?

55:20.557 --> 55:24.392
No, no, no, no. You're gonna finish
digging your section of the moat.

55:24.394 --> 55:26.361
Oh, it's yummy!

55:28.631 --> 55:30.165
Nobody moves.

55:30.167 --> 55:31.700
We have swine on the spit.

55:31.702 --> 55:34.502
Turkey swine,
but swine nonetheless.

55:34.504 --> 55:36.304
You lost him in canned foods?

55:36.306 --> 55:38.506
You led him straight to our camp!

55:38.508 --> 55:40.608
I'm going potty!

55:40.610 --> 55:44.245
Hit the sod! Cops!

55:49.586 --> 55:53.788
And why in heronius's name did you
tell everyone about us kissing?

55:53.790 --> 55:55.790
I didn't. I swear I... I didn't.

55:55.792 --> 55:57.192
Well, how does Clancy know?

55:57.194 --> 56:00.028
- Well, uh, Angie.
- Angie! That's great.

56:00.030 --> 56:02.163
How am I supposed to manage people

56:02.165 --> 56:04.566
If they all think I'm trying
to scam on the citizens?

56:04.568 --> 56:07.836
Which I'm not, 'cause that wouldn't
be a safe working environment.

56:07.838 --> 56:10.780
Well, it doesn't matter if you
like me, does it? I mean...

56:10.806 --> 56:15.310
Can we just stay focused on the goal?
Which is to get me a job, remember?

56:15.312 --> 56:17.512
Right. Right.

56:17.514 --> 56:20.115
So... just stay focused.

56:20.117 --> 56:22.684
Well, you don't have to
be so mean about it.

56:22.686 --> 56:24.419
Sorry.

56:24.421 --> 56:27.322
I'm sorry.

56:27.324 --> 56:29.958
Like another pancake up there?

56:29.960 --> 56:31.893
Come one, come all!

56:31.895 --> 56:34.863
There's nothing like a spot
of food in the morning, eh?

56:34.865 --> 56:39.434
Grace us with your presence while
we grace you with our food.

56:50.346 --> 56:52.113
How many more of those do you have?

56:52.115 --> 56:54.783
Enough. What's in it for me?

56:54.785 --> 56:57.819
This is utopia, brother. We're
supposed to share everything.

56:57.821 --> 57:00.955
- And?
- I got a buck.

57:00.957 --> 57:02.457
That ain't gonna cut it.

57:03.659 --> 57:08.496
Nothing in this world's
free, man. Nothin'.

57:20.342 --> 57:22.377
More.

57:28.350 --> 57:29.684
More.

57:38.794 --> 57:42.297
All rightie.

57:42.299 --> 57:44.666
- How many do you want?
- Nine.

57:45.868 --> 57:50.605
We'll start with two. See me later.

57:56.012 --> 57:58.112
Get down! Everybody down!

58:16.799 --> 58:18.766
Hey.

58:23.138 --> 58:25.974
Hi! I'm looking for... Voss.

58:25.976 --> 58:28.209
Is he here?
Uh, I'm Voss.

58:28.211 --> 58:30.745
Kay crossland.
Channel four news.

58:30.747 --> 58:33.381
I want to do a special on the
nine o'clock spot this evening.

58:33.383 --> 58:35.850
Do you have time for
a brief interview?

58:35.852 --> 58:38.753
Absolutely!
Good.

58:38.755 --> 58:40.922
The axis one day,

58:40.924 --> 58:42.390
The psychic universe,

58:42.392 --> 58:44.425
Where it's as if it works
on a cosmic level,

58:44.427 --> 58:47.262
Every planet pulling the energy
from this very unicorn...

58:47.264 --> 58:48.963
Great.
That's just great.

58:48.965 --> 58:52.200
So, how would you state that
for the layman?

58:52.202 --> 58:55.036
I wouldn't. If you don't understand
that, you're probably not a gamer

58:55.038 --> 58:58.106
- And shouldn't be coming to the 'corn.
- Okay!

58:58.108 --> 58:59.641
I think we're ready
for the money shot.

58:59.643 --> 59:03.945
Uh, I could have the guild
make a little pyramid...

59:03.947 --> 59:07.515
- Be about there.
- Something bigger.

59:07.517 --> 59:12.387
Like you standing triumphantly
on a mountaintop.

59:12.389 --> 59:15.267
Absolutely.

59:15.993 --> 59:19.561
- I'm this close to getting that job.
- I wish I could go with you.

59:19.563 --> 59:22.664
Listen, I need you to be thinking of
a way to get Shadow Hawk out of here

59:22.666 --> 59:25.667
Before I get back.
All right, yeah, yeah.

59:25.669 --> 59:28.303
Voss. Um...

59:30.639 --> 59:32.540
I, uh...

59:33.742 --> 59:36.144
That's your good side.

59:36.146 --> 59:39.314
All right.
Well, I'll see ya.

59:49.592 --> 59:51.659
She said I should come along,

59:51.661 --> 59:53.828
Maybe use me for some shots.

01:00:44.079 --> 01:00:47.382
Oh, boy, we are really
burning daylight.

01:00:47.384 --> 01:00:49.083
Okay, that's our mountain
up there,

01:00:49.085 --> 01:00:51.586
And let's just blaze a trail

01:00:51.588 --> 01:00:53.521
Right up to that tree.

01:00:53.523 --> 01:00:55.523
Okay, let's go!
Hut, hut, hike!

01:00:55.525 --> 01:00:58.559
Hup, hup, hup! Let's go!
All right! Hurry!

01:00:58.561 --> 01:01:01.963
Bob, prep the camera.
I gotta get my notes.

01:01:31.593 --> 01:01:34.162
How did we not see that coming?

01:01:34.164 --> 01:01:36.397
We're such idiots, man.

01:01:36.399 --> 01:01:38.833
Like, there were
no channel numbers on the van.

01:01:38.835 --> 01:01:41.836
And then we got in, they're like,
"hey, you want some candy?"

01:01:41.838 --> 01:01:46.574
And then we're like, "sure! Take us to an
undisclosed location and dump our bodies."

01:01:46.576 --> 01:01:48.810
And then, like, you,
you're all serious...

01:01:48.812 --> 01:01:52.380
Shut up! All right?
Shut up! I get it!

01:01:53.849 --> 01:01:55.783
- You shut up.
- You know what?

01:01:55.785 --> 01:01:59.053
When we get back I want you to get
your crap and get out of the city,

01:01:59.055 --> 01:02:00.321
You're banished to the apartment.

01:02:00.323 --> 01:02:02.990
Okay, good. Because
this is stupid city!

01:02:02.992 --> 01:02:06.027
- Yeah, so go.
- It's hot, and it's... It's...

01:02:06.029 --> 01:02:07.695
- It's gross...
- Yeah. Run!

01:02:07.697 --> 01:02:09.864
- Run, little kitty, be free!
- I will!

01:02:09.866 --> 01:02:11.632
- Okay, great!
- And I'll be free with my sword!

01:02:11.634 --> 01:02:13.267
- Don't touch it!
- It's my sword!

01:02:13.269 --> 01:02:15.002
- Do not touch the sword!
- Because you stole it!

01:02:15.004 --> 01:02:16.938
- Stop it!
- You...

01:02:18.874 --> 01:02:22.577
Oh, do it. Oh, I... I would
love for you to do that again.

01:02:22.579 --> 01:02:24.645
Don't... Don't...
Sword...

01:02:24.647 --> 01:02:26.380
Don't...

01:02:32.555 --> 01:02:33.721
Shut up!

01:02:36.024 --> 01:02:37.458
Huh?

01:02:39.795 --> 01:02:40.995
Get up.

01:02:42.531 --> 01:02:45.166
Why don't you be a man?
That's it!

01:02:45.168 --> 01:02:47.935
You got it now...
Why don't you be a man?!

01:02:50.005 --> 01:02:52.340
I heard my throat crunch.

01:02:58.547 --> 01:03:01.649
Clancy, come back, man.
I'm sorry!

01:03:35.851 --> 01:03:37.451
Uhh!
Where's Clancy?

01:03:38.453 --> 01:03:42.390
You're the only one who stayed.

01:03:42.392 --> 01:03:45.860
We're the last ones.
Not exactly.

01:03:45.862 --> 01:03:49.363
Um, gunight
actually is still here.

01:03:51.667 --> 01:03:54.035
What's up, dude... Ohh!
Yeah.

01:03:54.037 --> 01:03:56.537
When we were running low
on t.P., he improvised,

01:03:56.539 --> 01:04:00.341
And we think it's poison oak.
What should we do?

01:04:00.343 --> 01:04:02.743
I don't know.
Let it air out.

01:04:02.745 --> 01:04:05.213
I'm gonna go kill Shadow Hawk.

01:04:05.215 --> 01:04:06.681
I talked to him about that,

01:04:06.683 --> 01:04:08.249
And he said
he wasn't involved. So I...

01:04:08.251 --> 01:04:11.219
I imagine anyone else who would
leave me in the desert to die

01:04:11.221 --> 01:04:13.387
For his own amusement.
You don't want to kill anyone.

01:04:13.389 --> 01:04:15.022
You don't want to
make a fool out of yourself.

01:04:15.024 --> 01:04:16.457
Ohh! Ow!

01:04:16.459 --> 01:04:18.759
- Oh, my gosh! Are you okay?
- Stupid mole!

01:04:18.761 --> 01:04:20.428
Oh, darny-Darn it!

01:04:20.430 --> 01:04:22.630
Are you okay?
Seriously, what's wrong?

01:04:22.632 --> 01:04:25.333
No, let me see it.
Are you okay?

01:04:45.153 --> 01:04:47.188
Are you okay?

01:04:47.190 --> 01:04:49.991
It looked like it really hurt.

01:04:49.993 --> 01:04:52.627
I mean, you really twisted it.

01:04:54.863 --> 01:04:57.732
Can I do anything?

01:04:57.734 --> 01:05:01.202
I learned at girls' camp you
shouldn't take your shoe off.

01:05:01.204 --> 01:05:03.704
And maybe we should elevate it?

01:05:03.706 --> 01:05:09.210
I'd be more than happy to help
bind it, or... or hold it up.

01:05:09.212 --> 01:05:11.512
Hello?

01:05:11.514 --> 01:05:14.882
Where are you?
Are you okay?

01:05:14.884 --> 01:05:18.019
It's probably really throbbing.

01:05:47.582 --> 01:05:49.784
Milady Rashanna.

01:05:51.186 --> 01:05:55.723
A challenge has been made fFor
the leadership of unicron city.

01:05:55.725 --> 01:05:58.392
- It's unicorn.
- Whoever wins the challenge,

01:05:58.394 --> 01:06:00.561
Shall be the leader.

01:06:00.563 --> 01:06:03.064
Whoever loses...

01:06:03.066 --> 01:06:08.069
Shall be the loser... and
may never come back again.

01:06:08.071 --> 01:06:10.705
- Agreed?
- Aye!

01:06:10.707 --> 01:06:13.407
I'm gonna club you
like a baby seal.

01:06:13.409 --> 01:06:17.144
Since you extended
the challenge, Voss,

01:06:17.146 --> 01:06:19.213
I choose the weapon.

01:06:29.224 --> 01:06:30.558
I choose wit.

01:06:30.560 --> 01:06:33.260
What?
A battle of wits.

01:06:33.262 --> 01:06:36.230
- Wits is not a weapon.
- The tongue is mightier than the sword.

01:06:36.232 --> 01:06:38.833
Bullcrap! We're gonna do this like men
and beat the hell out of each other!

01:06:38.835 --> 01:06:42.169
Under the code of the bardlidans,
to which you are bound,

01:06:42.171 --> 01:06:44.138
I may choose the weapon...

01:06:44.140 --> 01:06:47.708
And it doesn't state
what manner of weapon.

01:06:47.710 --> 01:06:49.910
Am I right, Marsha?

01:06:51.079 --> 01:06:53.914
I shall throw down
the gauntlet and go first.

01:06:55.384 --> 01:07:00.688
A troll and an elf are walking
down a pebbled path together.

01:07:00.690 --> 01:07:03.090
Oh, no.
Story problems.

01:07:03.092 --> 01:07:06.861
The troll is carrying
20 pounds of pastries;

01:07:06.863 --> 01:07:10.464
The elf has a bundle of
sticks weighing 50 pounds.

01:07:10.466 --> 01:07:14.335
Which one will get to the end first?
You have ten seconds.

01:07:14.337 --> 01:07:17.138
Tick, tock...

01:07:18.941 --> 01:07:21.242
Tick tock, tick...

01:07:21.244 --> 01:07:22.610
Tock...

01:07:22.612 --> 01:07:26.747
The troll! Because the
troll would eat the elf!

01:07:28.283 --> 01:07:33.721
Wrong. Both... Because
the elf is in the troll.

01:07:36.993 --> 01:07:39.393
No, it's the troll!
Let's just assume

01:07:39.395 --> 01:07:42.763
That story problems are
beyond your cranial capacity,

01:07:42.765 --> 01:07:47.568
And we'll move into the ancient
art of maternal insults,

01:07:47.570 --> 01:07:49.303
Shall we?

01:07:52.107 --> 01:07:55.976
Your mother...

01:07:55.978 --> 01:08:00.381
Smokes troll malarkey
in a corncob pipe.

01:08:07.055 --> 01:08:10.191
Your mom...

01:08:10.193 --> 01:08:12.927
Dated a dragon.

01:08:14.830 --> 01:08:16.162
Hmm.

01:08:17.332 --> 01:08:19.500
I win!

01:08:23.071 --> 01:08:26.573
Now it's time for you to go home

01:08:26.576 --> 01:08:29.243
Walk home, walk home you
would all give up your honor

01:08:29.245 --> 01:08:32.412
For pancakes and couple of orcs!

01:08:36.084 --> 01:08:37.718
No, Voss!

01:08:40.990 --> 01:08:42.990
Marsha...

01:08:44.158 --> 01:08:45.859
Hold him back!

01:08:52.734 --> 01:08:56.002
As rightful leader of unicron city,

01:08:56.005 --> 01:09:01.008
I will enact righteous judgment
that Voss be banished!

01:09:01.010 --> 01:09:03.042
Do any oppose?

01:09:09.518 --> 01:09:11.618
Go!

01:09:13.188 --> 01:09:15.256
Are you all right?

01:09:29.938 --> 01:09:33.174
Walk away, Voss.

01:09:33.176 --> 01:09:35.276
Walk away in shame!

01:09:39.413 --> 01:09:41.148
Voss!

01:09:47.087 --> 01:09:48.889
Voss.

01:09:48.890 --> 01:09:53.493
Magmald and Rashanna's
love can endure this.

01:09:53.496 --> 01:09:56.363
Magmald and Rashanna?

01:09:56.365 --> 01:09:58.632
This is over.

01:09:58.634 --> 01:10:01.302
This was a game to get a job,

01:10:01.304 --> 01:10:03.671
And it failed.

01:10:03.673 --> 01:10:06.373
I know this is a game,
Voss, I'm not...

01:10:06.375 --> 01:10:09.677
I'm talking about us.
We're not a game.

01:10:09.679 --> 01:10:14.648
I don't know what you're trying to start
between us through our characters,

01:10:14.650 --> 01:10:16.850
But it's not gonna work, okay?

01:10:16.852 --> 01:10:19.787
We're not gonna live
happily ever after.

01:10:19.789 --> 01:10:24.291
I'm not your knight, I'm
not gonna save you.

01:10:24.293 --> 01:10:26.460
What about our kiss?

01:10:28.463 --> 01:10:33.467
Our... Our kiss was part of
all this magic and wonder.

01:10:35.303 --> 01:10:40.241
So... so you were
just playing a part?

01:10:40.243 --> 01:10:42.710
Yeah.

01:10:44.913 --> 01:10:48.148
It didn't mean anything?

01:10:48.150 --> 01:10:49.817
Right.

01:10:54.289 --> 01:10:55.856
Do me a favor.

01:10:55.858 --> 01:10:58.359
The next time that you
see your character,

01:10:58.361 --> 01:11:02.096
Tell him that I think he's an ass!

01:11:13.675 --> 01:11:15.276
I just think I need to leave.

01:11:15.278 --> 01:11:19.213
Marsha, you are in no condition
to walk miles back to town.

01:11:19.215 --> 01:11:22.082
You suffered blunt-Force trauma!
I need to leave. I just...

01:11:22.084 --> 01:11:26.420
No. Marsha, you stood directly
in front of that pipe

01:11:26.422 --> 01:11:29.056
Which was aimed at me.

01:11:30.258 --> 01:11:33.127
How many fingers am I holding up?
Two.

01:11:33.129 --> 01:11:36.263
You see? I was
holding up one.

01:11:36.265 --> 01:11:39.033
Now, please allow me
to return the favor.

01:11:39.035 --> 01:11:42.403
Hmm? I have a cold pack
inside which we can apply,

01:11:42.405 --> 01:11:44.872
And it'll help to bring
down the swelling.

01:11:44.874 --> 01:11:47.041
Come! Okay.

01:11:49.144 --> 01:11:51.412
Well...
It's very cold.

01:11:51.414 --> 01:11:53.213
Really cold?
Ice cold.

01:12:06.761 --> 01:12:09.163
Ohh. Okay.

01:12:10.198 --> 01:12:12.433
Aaah!
That's it, bro.

01:12:12.435 --> 01:12:15.769
I gave you many chances.
You're out of here!

01:12:15.771 --> 01:12:17.938
No! No!

01:12:19.741 --> 01:12:21.775
You don't show up at the taco shop,

01:12:21.777 --> 01:12:26.213
So pack up your stuff,
bro... and go.

01:12:36.825 --> 01:12:38.225
Where you goin'?

01:12:38.227 --> 01:12:41.061
I'm joining the marines
to get a sword.

01:12:41.063 --> 01:12:44.231
- Right.
- Or the national guard or whatever.

01:12:44.233 --> 01:12:47.935
Because unlike someone here,
I know what's important.

01:12:47.937 --> 01:12:50.504
So you go ahead and leave.
Go get your sword.

01:12:50.506 --> 01:12:52.539
You don't get it.

01:12:52.541 --> 01:12:54.641
She is in love with you.

01:12:54.643 --> 01:12:58.679
- Come on, Clancy. We're friends.
- Oh, just friends.

01:12:58.681 --> 01:13:02.249
That makes more sense, because I
thought you were treating her that way

01:13:02.251 --> 01:13:04.718
Because you're a big dumb-ass.

01:13:04.720 --> 01:13:06.887
But now that I know you're
just friends, that...

01:13:06.889 --> 01:13:10.224
- Get out.
- Ya know, one of these days

01:13:10.226 --> 01:13:15.362
Someone's gonna come along
and sweep her off her feet...

01:13:15.364 --> 01:13:18.265
And then you'll
realize what you had.

01:13:20.301 --> 01:13:23.837
I'd wish you good luck, but...

01:13:23.839 --> 01:13:27.107
You're probably gonna screw it up.

01:13:53.135 --> 01:13:56.036
What, what, what, what?!

01:13:57.071 --> 01:14:00.407
Oh, man. Okay,
count of three, right?

01:14:00.409 --> 01:14:02.609
One. Sorry, bro.

01:14:02.611 --> 01:14:04.144
On there.

01:14:05.947 --> 01:14:07.581
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

01:14:07.583 --> 01:14:09.149
Release toxins.

01:14:09.151 --> 01:14:11.618
Release the toxins.

01:14:17.392 --> 01:14:19.426
The doc is in the house.

01:14:19.428 --> 01:14:21.929
There. Good as new.
You all right?

01:14:21.931 --> 01:14:25.399
Ohh! Thanks for that.

01:14:25.401 --> 01:14:27.601
Hey, uh...

01:14:27.603 --> 01:14:29.870
Clancy was right.

01:14:29.872 --> 01:14:31.939
About Marsha?

01:15:12.747 --> 01:15:16.016
What are these supposed
to do exactly?

01:15:17.752 --> 01:15:22.589
Well, I freeze magnets just
for occasions like this.

01:15:22.591 --> 01:15:25.392
The cold helps to bring
down the swelling,

01:15:25.394 --> 01:15:28.762
And the magnets
increase circulation.

01:15:28.764 --> 01:15:30.097
Hmm.

01:15:32.767 --> 01:15:35.536
Oh, you don't have to do that.
With the correct amount of pressure,

01:15:35.538 --> 01:15:38.472
- Okay.
- We can release all of the negative energy

01:15:38.474 --> 01:15:41.174
And quicken the rate at which
the swelling will go down.

01:15:41.176 --> 01:15:44.011
So if I press here...

01:15:44.013 --> 01:15:48.315
I'm actually sending and receiving
messages from your kidneys.

01:15:50.218 --> 01:15:52.719
Hello, Mr. Kidney.

01:15:54.389 --> 01:15:56.690
26-Charlie, copy detail.

01:15:56.692 --> 01:16:01.962
Suspicious persons trespassing on county
build site, possible 604. Use caution.

01:16:01.964 --> 01:16:03.864
S0 when are you retiring, again?

01:16:16.077 --> 01:16:17.344
Rashanna...

01:16:17.346 --> 01:16:20.514
"Rashanna."
That's very pretty.

01:16:20.516 --> 01:16:22.816
Where did you come up
with that character name?

01:16:22.818 --> 01:16:27.955
Um, the egyptian sun god
and a friend from the 8th grade.

01:16:27.957 --> 01:16:32.125
How about you? How'd you
come up with "Shadow Hawk"?

01:16:32.127 --> 01:16:35.195
That's a temporary character name.

01:16:35.197 --> 01:16:37.898
What do you mean?

01:16:37.900 --> 01:16:41.635
Well, I...

01:16:41.637 --> 01:16:44.204
I didn't want to tell you
my real character name.

01:16:44.206 --> 01:16:47.574
Why not?
I was shy.

01:16:48.977 --> 01:16:51.178
I'm confused.

01:16:52.780 --> 01:16:56.850
My real character name is...

01:16:58.787 --> 01:17:00.587
"Tanick Stormblade."

01:17:01.889 --> 01:17:02.903
What?!

01:17:02.929 --> 01:17:05.893
I was so excited to tell you,
but then you broke up with me!

01:17:05.995 --> 01:17:09.930
I wanted you to judge me on my
true character, not on my age.

01:17:09.932 --> 01:17:12.499
You said you were 26!
I wasn't being honest,

01:17:12.501 --> 01:17:15.235
But... But I am being honest
when I tell you that...

01:17:15.237 --> 01:17:17.170
I'm into you.

01:17:17.172 --> 01:17:19.740
Oh, that's gross.

01:17:35.890 --> 01:17:41.128
- What the...?
- It's like a geek breeding ground.

01:17:45.700 --> 01:17:48.101
Do you know how hard

01:17:48.103 --> 01:17:50.404
It was to be in the guild with you

01:17:50.406 --> 01:17:52.739
Without the ability to
reach out and touch you,

01:17:52.741 --> 01:17:55.909
To never speak the words
that just ached to be said?

01:17:55.911 --> 01:17:57.244
No.
Aaaah...

01:17:57.246 --> 01:17:59.913
But here we are together...
again.

01:17:59.915 --> 01:18:03.717
Like the forces were pulling
us together... like magnets!

01:18:03.719 --> 01:18:08.588
Well, then how can I show you
the depth of my love?

01:18:08.590 --> 01:18:10.090
By letting me out.

01:18:10.092 --> 01:18:12.926
Rather, how about
if I recite a sonata?

01:18:12.928 --> 01:18:17.130
Let me out!

01:18:17.132 --> 01:18:19.132
No! I'm just
trying to leave!

01:18:19.134 --> 01:18:20.834
I... I...

01:18:20.836 --> 01:18:23.270
I didn't... No, no, no...
I just want to...

01:18:23.272 --> 01:18:26.306
Please! I'm just going...
Wait...

01:18:28.042 --> 01:18:31.545
You dirty old man.

01:18:31.547 --> 01:18:36.750
I oughta shank you right now
and save the taxpayers...

01:18:36.752 --> 01:18:40.754
There's a reason
there's no trespassing!

01:18:40.756 --> 01:18:42.956
This is a super fund site!

01:18:42.958 --> 01:18:44.858
The entire ground is poisoned!

01:18:44.860 --> 01:18:49.196
You're probably gonna have
two-Headed babies!

01:18:52.900 --> 01:18:54.935
Be careful, everyone!

01:18:54.937 --> 01:18:56.670
The ground is poisoned!

01:18:56.672 --> 01:19:00.073
The ground is poisoned!
It's poisoned.

01:19:00.075 --> 01:19:01.308
It's poisoned.

01:19:01.310 --> 01:19:04.311
The ground is poisoned.

01:19:04.313 --> 01:19:06.113
Whoop! Well, what are
you gonna do now?

01:19:06.115 --> 01:19:10.050
Slap some plastic cuffs on me
and sing me "happy birthday"?

01:19:10.052 --> 01:19:11.184
Hmm?

01:19:11.186 --> 01:19:13.653
Come again?

01:19:15.256 --> 01:19:19.726
How much did Voss pay to hire
this pathetic performance?

01:19:22.096 --> 01:19:24.564
I want everyone
to take five steps back

01:19:24.566 --> 01:19:27.701
And get face down
on the ground now!!!

01:19:27.703 --> 01:19:32.506
Well, that was almost believable.

01:19:33.941 --> 01:19:35.609
Get down on your knees

01:19:35.611 --> 01:19:39.679
And put your hands
behind your back.

01:19:41.183 --> 01:19:42.983
Do it!

01:19:49.624 --> 01:19:51.224
Aaah!

01:19:51.226 --> 01:19:53.927
Aaaaah!

01:19:53.929 --> 01:19:56.363
Mooner!
Run! Run!

01:19:58.033 --> 01:19:59.900
Mooners.

01:20:12.513 --> 01:20:14.114
Ow!!!

01:20:14.116 --> 01:20:15.582
What did you do to Marsha?

01:20:15.584 --> 01:20:18.718
Of course you'd come back!

01:20:24.126 --> 01:20:25.525
Hands off of him!

01:20:25.527 --> 01:20:28.662
Mooner, get up!
Hands in the air now!

01:20:28.664 --> 01:20:31.264
Hands where I can see 'em!
Okay! I'm just gonna...

01:20:31.266 --> 01:20:33.900
Put your hands up!
Get your hands up!

01:20:33.902 --> 01:20:36.203
I need my pills!

01:20:36.205 --> 01:20:38.171
I'm sorry...
Hands in the air!

01:20:38.173 --> 01:20:40.540
Aaahh....yahh!

01:20:45.813 --> 01:20:49.382
Girl, I am now
gonna count! One...

01:21:02.296 --> 01:21:05.198
Aaaahh...

01:21:05.200 --> 01:21:07.300
aaaahhh!!!

01:21:07.302 --> 01:21:08.902
Uhh!

01:21:08.904 --> 01:21:10.370
Ohh!

01:21:21.917 --> 01:21:24.317
Voss.

01:21:24.319 --> 01:21:25.418
Voss!

01:21:31.125 --> 01:21:35.462
That. Hurt. So. Bad.

01:21:37.331 --> 01:21:39.499
I knew you'd come back for me.

01:21:39.501 --> 01:21:41.935
- Get 'em over here!
- Don't split up!

01:21:41.937 --> 01:21:45.572
Don't make any sudden movements!
You're gonna spook 'em!

01:21:45.574 --> 01:21:49.276
Hamwater, what are you doing?!

01:21:49.278 --> 01:21:52.679
Listen, Magmald's in my pocket.

01:21:52.681 --> 01:21:54.748
See if you can reach back
and cut us free.

01:21:54.750 --> 01:21:56.950
Okay.
On three, okay?

01:21:56.952 --> 01:21:59.219
One, two, three.

01:22:01.556 --> 01:22:04.157
Got him?
Yeah.

01:22:07.962 --> 01:22:10.297
Aahh! You got it!

01:22:10.299 --> 01:22:12.766
Aah.
Okay.

01:22:16.270 --> 01:22:18.038
Uhh. I'm... I'm good.

01:22:21.909 --> 01:22:24.210
Hold this.

01:22:31.786 --> 01:22:35.522
Take her to safety!
Stop for no one! Go!

01:22:49.704 --> 01:22:52.605
Hamwater!

01:22:52.607 --> 01:22:56.076
What is the matter with you?!

01:23:01.015 --> 01:23:02.449
Thanks.

01:23:05.853 --> 01:23:08.021
Stop moving!

01:23:08.023 --> 01:23:10.156
Don't move!

01:23:11.292 --> 01:23:12.959
Stay right where you are!

01:23:12.961 --> 01:23:15.662
Friends of the guild!
Look to the bard!

01:23:15.664 --> 01:23:18.865
From his song we gather
strength, and charge!

01:23:19.934 --> 01:23:23.436
We gather strength,
and chaaaaarge!!!

01:23:23.438 --> 01:23:26.239
Get in formation!

01:23:29.310 --> 01:23:31.244
Shields!

01:23:40.888 --> 01:23:44.257
Off... Officers in
need of assistance!

01:23:46.894 --> 01:23:49.162
Chaaaaarge!!!!

01:23:54.535 --> 01:23:57.704
Start the car!!!

01:24:20.394 --> 01:24:23.963
Did we not repulse the
charging horde's onslaught?

01:24:23.965 --> 01:24:26.166
Yeah!!!

01:24:27.768 --> 01:24:31.938
I do not deserve to be your leader.
I deceived you.

01:24:31.940 --> 01:24:36.209
I used you to get a job.
And for that, I'm sorry.

01:24:36.211 --> 01:24:40.613
We can start over again.
It will be a new beginning.

01:24:40.615 --> 01:24:42.782
Yeah!!!!

01:24:42.784 --> 01:24:44.818
If you will take me
again as your leader,

01:24:44.820 --> 01:24:47.187
I will make the city
thrive once again!

01:24:47.189 --> 01:24:51.925
So that all may live in peace
against tyranny and aggression

01:24:51.927 --> 01:24:54.661
from those...

01:24:54.663 --> 01:24:57.330
Drop your weapons and
get on the ground now!

01:24:57.332 --> 01:25:00.366
- Get down now!
- Stay down on the ground...

01:25:00.368 --> 01:25:03.303
Move!
Get down, peter pan!

01:25:05.539 --> 01:25:07.974
All rightie, then.

01:25:09.376 --> 01:25:11.211
You can get down now!

01:25:17.785 --> 01:25:21.354
I'd like all of you to
approach the bench.

01:25:31.098 --> 01:25:34.834
What in the world were
you doing out there?

01:25:36.971 --> 01:25:40.039
Nothing... sir.

01:25:40.041 --> 01:25:43.543
Creating a utopia for gamers.

01:25:43.545 --> 01:25:45.378
Is that right?

01:25:50.718 --> 01:25:54.220
I bet you could have a lot
of fun in a place like that.

01:25:54.222 --> 01:25:57.190
I'll bet you could get
a lot of families to show up,

01:25:57.192 --> 01:26:01.227
Maybe some at-Risk youth
to help set things up.

01:26:01.229 --> 01:26:06.766
I'm giving you all 800 hours
of community service...

01:26:06.768 --> 01:26:10.870
To build your unicorn city
at the municipal park.

01:26:10.872 --> 01:26:14.274
And it better be good.

01:26:22.483 --> 01:26:27.720
I'll drop it to 700 hours
if I can be king.

01:26:31.859 --> 01:26:34.160
Yes, your majesty.

01:26:35.763 --> 01:26:38.464
Cradle it.

01:26:38.466 --> 01:26:40.099
Cradle it like a baby.

01:26:41.936 --> 01:26:44.304
Softly...
What are you doing?

01:26:44.306 --> 01:26:47.173
That's a tortilla-Wrapped
gut-Ache. Seriously,

01:26:47.175 --> 01:26:49.842
How much cabbage you think one
person can consume in one sitting?

01:26:49.844 --> 01:26:53.713
I don't care. Okay? I don't have
to do this. I'm too good for this.

01:26:53.715 --> 01:26:58.051
I'm so glad that you are happy
in taco town, but I'm out.

01:27:00.187 --> 01:27:03.389
Is that what you think of me?
That you're better than me?

01:27:03.391 --> 01:27:04.824
Well, you're not, bro!

01:27:04.826 --> 01:27:09.963
Tacos are awesome!
This restaurant is my life!

01:27:09.965 --> 01:27:12.966
Drop your weapons
and get on the ground now!

01:27:12.968 --> 01:27:16.269
You got arrested
trying to get a job with us?

01:27:16.271 --> 01:27:17.937
Yeah.

01:27:17.939 --> 01:27:21.407
You got the job, man.
Are you serious?

01:27:21.409 --> 01:27:26.212
I've never seen anyone go
to these lengths for a job.

01:27:26.214 --> 01:27:30.850
So how soon before
you can move up to Seattle?

01:27:30.852 --> 01:27:34.220
I have some community service
to finish, but...

01:27:34.222 --> 01:27:36.456
Sure. Take as much time
as you need.

01:27:36.458 --> 01:27:39.025
Do you mind if I show this
to some of the guys?

01:27:39.027 --> 01:27:41.060
No.

01:27:41.062 --> 01:27:46.666
I thought you were gonna organize
a canned food drive or something,

01:27:46.668 --> 01:27:49.435
But this?
This is amazing.

01:27:51.006 --> 01:27:54.173
Oh. Oh...

01:28:27.508 --> 01:28:29.108
Hey.

01:28:31.646 --> 01:28:34.514
You got the job.

01:28:37.451 --> 01:28:38.785
No.

01:28:38.787 --> 01:28:41.521
I'm really sorry. I...

01:28:43.624 --> 01:28:46.893
It's okay. Uh...

01:28:46.895 --> 01:28:50.363
I can live with it.

01:28:50.365 --> 01:28:51.864
Here.

01:28:52.933 --> 01:28:55.034
See ya up there.

01:28:59.640 --> 01:29:02.175
As king of this fair land,

01:29:02.177 --> 01:29:05.945
I wish to welcome you all
to the official opening of...

01:29:05.947 --> 01:29:08.748
Unicorn city!

01:29:10.685 --> 01:29:11.685
Finally!

01:29:15.256 --> 01:29:17.123
Go!

01:29:18.659 --> 01:29:20.426
Whoo!

01:29:21.562 --> 01:29:25.131
Blow down your door

01:29:25.133 --> 01:29:29.202
Where you say get yourself
a straight job

01:29:29.204 --> 01:29:32.305
And no, never bored, no never

01:29:36.477 --> 01:29:40.079
You lost your head

01:29:40.081 --> 01:29:45.451
See, we're all

01:29:45.453 --> 01:29:47.620
On our way out

01:29:50.424 --> 01:29:55.495
Been through it all

01:29:55.497 --> 01:30:00.133
Reelin' in everyone

01:30:00.135 --> 01:30:02.568
Wild jazz they scrape

01:30:02.570 --> 01:30:04.103
Scrape by...

01:30:05.672 --> 01:30:07.774
That's fiber, by the way.

01:30:07.776 --> 01:30:09.609
Mmm. Mmm.

01:30:09.611 --> 01:30:11.677
Lords and ladies,

01:30:11.679 --> 01:30:14.981
Di tom inpaderi vero.

01:30:14.983 --> 01:30:16.716
Baby.
I know this.

01:30:16.718 --> 01:30:19.385
I studied all night for,
like, a half hour, okay?

01:30:19.387 --> 01:30:21.854
You make up a language
and you force me to use it.

01:30:21.856 --> 01:30:23.689
It's very difficult, okay?

01:30:23.691 --> 01:30:24.891
Al castiba...

01:30:24.893 --> 01:30:29.128
El wunya ronley hoo-Hoo.

01:30:29.130 --> 01:30:32.799
Will you temper
your words and actions

01:30:32.801 --> 01:30:34.267
With love...

01:30:37.671 --> 01:30:43.009
So, I have some ideas for
the campaign you suggested.

01:30:43.011 --> 01:30:45.311
Oh. Oh, yeah.

01:30:45.313 --> 01:30:50.283
What if... Magmald came down
from the astral plane

01:30:50.285 --> 01:30:54.187
After months of
aimlessly wandering,

01:30:54.189 --> 01:30:56.589
Rashanna finds him weakened

01:30:56.591 --> 01:31:00.493
And carries him back
to her woodland home...

01:31:04.898 --> 01:31:07.867
Where she... saves him

01:31:07.869 --> 01:31:10.503
By nursing him back to health

01:31:10.505 --> 01:31:12.872
With feral berries and moss...

01:31:12.874 --> 01:31:16.008
And they live happily ever after,

01:31:16.010 --> 01:31:19.612
And have a whole litter
of baby bardladins.

01:31:27.087 --> 01:31:29.088
Ronley hoo-Hoo.

01:31:30.057 --> 01:31:31.524
Kiss her now?

01:31:33.827 --> 01:31:36.195
Awww...

01:31:37.297 --> 01:31:39.398
Nose.

01:31:44.404 --> 01:31:47.773
All right, thank you,
everyone, for coming, so much.

01:31:51.212 --> 01:31:54.580
We have sno-Cones,
so everyone enjoy!

01:31:57.919 --> 01:32:00.486
Arm yourselves!

01:32:07.027 --> 01:32:11.898
I've got 20,000 more experience
points since we've last feuded!

01:32:11.900 --> 01:32:13.366
En garde!

01:32:18.672 --> 01:32:22.775
<i>Let's go dancing</i>

01:32:22.777 --> 01:32:26.145
<i>And fall in love</i>

01:32:26.147 --> 01:32:30.583
<i>For the first time</i>

01:32:30.585 --> 01:32:32.618
<i>Again</i>

01:32:34.821 --> 01:32:39.325
<i>And five years later...</i>

01:33:44.491 --> 01:33:46.559
<i>Welcome to unicorn city</i>

01:33:46.561 --> 01:33:48.561
<i>Yeah, what</i>

01:33:48.563 --> 01:33:50.930
<i>This is your world</i>

01:33:50.932 --> 01:33:52.765
<i>I was cruisin' down
the astral plane</i>

01:33:52.767 --> 01:33:54.867
<i>Heard a freaky wizard
calling my name</i>

01:33:54.869 --> 01:33:57.003
<i>He was gettin' a spell
sent me straight to hell</i>

01:33:57.005 --> 01:33:58.871
<i>But I don't care 'cause
it's dawn of days</i>

01:33:58.873 --> 01:34:00.906
<i>I get my hands all
covered in brain juice</i>

01:34:00.908 --> 01:34:03.075
<i>Bring it down to the party
where we break loose</i>

01:34:03.077 --> 01:34:04.810
<i>And take a succubus</i>

01:34:04.812 --> 01:34:07.146
<i>To beat this potion
'cause it's 80 proof</i>

01:34:07.148 --> 01:34:10.816
<i>Let's roll to the party like
we roll them polyhedral dice</i>

01:34:10.818 --> 01:34:14.854
<i>Let's roll a d-11 not once,
not 20 times but thrice</i>

01:34:14.856 --> 01:34:18.724
<i>Let's roll with the punches from
my mortal enemies and foes</i>

01:34:18.726 --> 01:34:22.728
<i>Let's roll creatures, let's roll</i>

01:34:22.730 --> 01:34:24.864
<i>I crossed paths with a
wicked, wicked hawk</i>

01:34:24.866 --> 01:34:26.866
<i>With his ears poppin'
out like spock</i>

01:34:26.868 --> 01:34:29.201
<i>Couldn't fool me with
his beady little eyes</i>

01:34:29.203 --> 01:34:31.070
<i>So I pop off his head like a cork</i>

01:34:31.072 --> 01:34:32.738
<i>A silver heaven that blew my mind</i>

01:34:32.740 --> 01:34:34.840
<i>The hawk's head came back to life</i>

01:34:34.842 --> 01:34:37.143
<i>So that mary and her lover
head down to the party</i>

01:34:37.145 --> 01:34:39.011
<i>With the head rollin' right behind</i>

01:34:39.013 --> 01:34:42.748
<i>Let's roll to the party like
we roll them polyhedral dice</i>

01:34:42.750 --> 01:34:46.552
<i>Let's roll a d-11, not once,
not 20 times but thrice</i>

01:34:46.554 --> 01:34:50.756
<i>Let's roll with the punches from
our mortal enemies and foes</i>

01:34:50.758 --> 01:34:55.294
<i>Let's roll, creatures, let's roll</i>

01:35:02.936 --> 01:35:04.937
<i>Meet the beastly,
he's the Beast Lord</i>

01:35:04.939 --> 01:35:06.806
<i>He's shootin' laser
beams like oh, my word!</i>

01:35:06.808 --> 01:35:09.175
<i>So I retaliate with my
psyonic death stare</i>

01:35:09.177 --> 01:35:10.776
<i>But I ricocheted through the floor</i>

01:35:10.778 --> 01:35:12.912
<i>So I entice that dude
with some turtlebuds</i>

01:35:12.914 --> 01:35:14.947
<i>And the shining glitter
tassels on my luscious duds</i>

01:35:14.949 --> 01:35:16.816
<i>He falls into my trance
and we begin to dance</i>

01:35:16.818 --> 01:35:18.884
<i>Now we rockin' this mortal's club</i>

01:35:18.886 --> 01:35:22.755
<i>Let's roll to the party like
we roll them polyhedral dice</i>

01:35:22.757 --> 01:35:26.525
<i>Let's roll a d-100, not once,
not 20 times but thrice</i>

01:35:26.527 --> 01:35:30.696
<i>Let's roll with the punches from
our mortal enemies and foes</i>

01:35:30.698 --> 01:35:34.767
<i>Let's roll, creatures, let's roll</i>

01:35:34.769 --> 01:35:38.404
<i>We gotta roll down to the area
where all the cool kids go</i>

01:35:38.406 --> 01:35:40.606
<i>We gotta get there,
get there real fast</i>

01:35:40.608 --> 01:35:42.675
<i>'Cause we're rollin',
we're rollin' the dice</i>

01:35:42.677 --> 01:35:46.412
<i>Polyhedral dice, baby, yeah</i>
