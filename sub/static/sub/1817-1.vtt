06:25.120 --> 06:27.032
and what does he have?

06:30.040 --> 06:32.271

06:36.360 --> 06:38.272
What's the matter, Mother?

08:38.640 --> 08:39.710
ULTRITEK
lab

08:41.080 --> 08:43.700
but this morning came
initial report on the experiences of mice

08:43.720 --> 08:45.500
and hits now equal to the Supervisory Board.

08:45.520 --> 08:48.500
looks as if the drug
would qualify for those bestseller.

08:48.520 --> 08:51.260
when you can in the market?
- the closest in four months.

08:51.280 --> 08:53.420

09:27.400 --> 09:28.980
Is this a joke?

09:29.000 --> 09:31.380
I do not care if it is in Barbados.

09:31.400 --> 09:33.437
I need the data directly.

09:49.800 --> 09:53.580
Ryan, you're right or left handed?
- Using the right hand. Why?

09:53.600 --> 09:55.796
because you will not need the left.

09:56.560 --> 09:59.020
even if you do not
eaten alive,

09:59.040 --> 10:02.340
It is good to see any
limbs you could do without.

10:02.360 --> 10:04.380
right. - Coach in waiting.

10:04.400 --> 10:05.675
Thank you.

10:08.800 --> 10:11.235
best offer takes the house.

10:11.680 --> 10:15.071
have divided us, me and Pete.
It takes on technical analysis...

10:15.240 --> 10:18.517
Believe me,
best is the single point of contact.

10:23.000 --> 10:25.071
So go forward, forward courageously. - Well.

10:27.840 --> 10:31.620
Well. As you know, the reason
Currently we alkylating agents

10:31.640 --> 10:34.780
severe hair loss,
above-average risk of infection

10:34.800 --> 10:36.340
and severe weight loss.

10:36.360 --> 10:40.700
we have developed a new method,
improves the effectiveness of the medication

10:40.720 --> 10:43.860
at a time and one of the side effects
reduced, without the slightest doubt.

10:43.880 --> 10:47.380
If you want to look at it?
- When I asked in the market?

10:47.400 --> 10:50.518
test series with tissue cultures
is not yet complete...

10:50.680 --> 10:54.356
then leave your report
here temporarily, and we will contact.

10:58.440 --> 10:59.920
Well, that's all.

11:09.480 --> 11:10.630
Thank you.

11:19.840 --> 11:22.992
starts UltriTech
patient tries to six weeks.

11:23.960 --> 11:25.633
Why? Experiments with humans?

11:27.360 --> 11:30.100
yet
thought they would be the first in four months?

11:30.120 --> 11:33.670
seems as if they have
miracles and mid-heavy.

11:35.360 --> 11:37.700
any chance,
because we can not keep up.

11:37.720 --> 11:40.740
've been making recently,
test tissue samples.

11:40.760 --> 11:45.118
I'm afraid you do not quite understand how
threatening situation.

11:47.080 --> 11:48.820
keep your cool, okay?

11:48.840 --> 11:52.700
for more than eight months
now we have poured our ass.

11:52.720 --> 11:56.460
and do not even ask for it.
Fuck with side effects.

11:56.480 --> 12:00.260
we are making great progress so far.
- Oh really? Ryan, is that so?

12:00.280 --> 12:04.260
drugs, as well as all the rest:
Letsipan, Nostaran, Triclostan.

12:04.280 --> 12:07.220
this is all just poison,
is pasted on a beautiful name.

12:07.240 --> 12:11.340
if they were "marzipan" call,
if they promise them more buyers.

12:11.360 --> 12:13.477
What do you expect?
There is a miracle cure?

12:15.400 --> 12:18.060
What is wrong with you?
- What do you mean?

12:18.080 --> 12:21.580
at Harvard University, we all agreed.
We wanted to be different.

12:21.600 --> 12:24.780
we wanted to share
to find an effective treatment.

12:24.800 --> 12:26.940
look around again, Beth.

12:26.960 --> 12:28.997
Harvard is long gone.

12:29.560 --> 12:31.358
This is about profit.

12:34.280 --> 12:36.940
afraid
on ScopaMed cocktail brainwashing

12:36.960 --> 12:38.997
you sipped a little more often.

12:40.480 --> 12:42.676
long but is no longer necessary.

12:45.520 --> 12:47.557
thou hast promised?

12:50.960 --> 12:53.600
and when are you going
me to admit that?

12:57.120 --> 13:00.352
sorry if you cut,
but the new ones will be there.

13:01.200 --> 13:03.032
Yes. All right.

13:03.280 --> 13:06.660
If we do not  before UltriTech
relationship with a drug to market,

13:06.680 --> 13:08.420
this company go down the drain.

13:08.440 --> 13:10.980
but authorities
human experiments allow only

13:11.000 --> 13:12.900
in the case of a report of toxicity.

13:12.920 --> 13:15.220
in itself,
three months experimenting with mice.

13:15.240 --> 13:17.740
skip rat experiments.

13:17.760 --> 13:19.240
No, certainly not.

13:19.840 --> 13:21.513
this is impossible.

13:22.840 --> 13:25.400
our agreement so I wanted to explode?

13:26.080 --> 13:29.391
moment.
What you requested, I have done.

13:29.760 --> 13:32.380
and we agreed on:
this time only.

13:32.400 --> 13:36.519
I'm sorry,
but for the second time not to do so.

13:37.120 --> 13:40.192
is the son of a passionate football player, I hear.

13:40.880 --> 13:42.109
Why?

13:42.920 --> 13:46.311
would be unfortunate if you would miss their games.

13:47.200 --> 13:49.060
What does that mean?

13:49.080 --> 13:53.100
not sure how easy,
prison to see how his son grow up.

13:53.120 --> 13:55.191
So you're threatening me with the police.

13:55.840 --> 13:59.100
forget
because we both stuck in it. - We both?

13:59.120 --> 14:01.430
never. No, Ted.

14:02.600 --> 14:04.637
you are alone.

14:05.720 --> 14:09.236
not even under
path leads to me.

14:10.000 --> 14:12.180
your word against mine.

14:12.200 --> 14:15.380
which is before the jury
perhaps more credible?

14:15.400 --> 14:18.020
general manager
a successful business,

14:18.040 --> 14:21.420
ten million annually
donate to the poor,

14:21.440 --> 14:25.100
or biochemistry
with his ex-wife addicted to drugs?

14:25.120 --> 14:27.635
for two years and is now clean.

14:29.600 --> 14:32.718
Ted,
there is only one, what I ask.

14:33.920 --> 14:35.877
make it easy again.

14:39.200 --> 14:42.079
which included,
it the last time?

14:45.120 --> 14:48.796
you would be right
convince your son's life?

14:56.840 --> 14:59.820
when everything is ready in the basement,
call Carlos.

14:59.840 --> 15:03.993
night in order to deliver new.

15:26.600 --> 15:28.080

constantly talking about, again? Madrid like?

15:33.320 --> 15:35.460
Youth Camp Real Madrid.

15:35.480 --> 15:38.460
You can even tonight
bag pack your gym?

15:38.480 --> 15:40.300
We fly tomorrow to go early.

15:40.320 --> 15:41.940
we fly to Spain?

15:41.960 --> 15:43.360
you and me.

15:43.920 --> 15:47.580
will need your passport. This is why...
- my mom has a pass, I ask them the same thing.

15:47.600 --> 15:48.980
No, no, no.

15:49.000 --> 15:53.074
tell her something.
This is our little secret.

15:53.960 --> 15:55.700
we keep this to ourselves, okay?

15:55.720 --> 15:56.820
Yes, of course.

15:56.840 --> 15:58.718
see you tomorrow morning.

15:59.040 --> 16:01.396
dad? Thank you.

16:12.400 --> 16:13.470

16:17.160 --> 16:18.740
and the rest of the ship?

16:18.760 --> 16:19.910
This  everything.

16:20.720 --> 16:24.316
I was ten.
Sleep again.

16:32.840 --> 16:37.140
will test for us here
novel agent for chemotherapy.

16:37.160 --> 16:39.540
even marketing experts
think of something better

16:39.560 --> 16:43.180
We continue to call it love:
ER-WYE-THREE-FOUR-ONE.

16:43.200 --> 16:46.860
In the first step, we extract
cell culture bottles in the freezer compartment

16:46.880 --> 16:49.020
The temperature in the incubator for two hours.

16:49.040 --> 16:51.460
then
living cells counted.

16:51.480 --> 16:54.871
Yes, there
then waits until the security field.

16:58.240 --> 16:59.879
and when you listen to?

17:01.440 --> 17:03.875
I will not leave the store without you.

17:04.720 --> 17:08.236
three weeks ago in
vacant, Beth.

17:09.720 --> 17:12.619
have something for you,
if you are interested.

17:12.640 --> 17:15.099
meckerst you're constantly on the job
and if you are honest,

17:15.119 --> 17:19.114
there's no reason one
does not stop here. But you can stay.

17:22.920 --> 17:25.992
in UltriTech want you too.

17:26.680 --> 17:29.400
and even want
search box.

17:36.320 --> 17:40.780
under any circumstances and allows you to
depending idea come to enter this room here.

17:40.800 --> 17:45.860
I suppose you know what damage both
havoc oncogenic virus in the bloodstream?

17:45.880 --> 17:48.300
good, but mentally
multiplies by ten.

17:48.320 --> 17:50.380
particular strain of
Merkel cell polyomavirus,

17:50.400 --> 17:53.860
we have developed here, cause
and accelerated tumor growth.

17:53.880 --> 17:59.035
In other words, if you are infected you,
hope to have something to be desired.

18:01.360 --> 18:03.431
George, hand me out a lot?

18:13.040 --> 18:16.140
this installment has ended
carried to the bench sterile,

18:16.160 --> 18:19.517
where the virus then you need to inject the cells in the culture.

18:24.920 --> 18:26.673
Why are you doing it for you hard?

18:27.680 --> 18:30.100
we both get better jobs,
earn much more than that.

18:30.120 --> 18:32.300
We finally
afford an apartment together.

18:32.320 --> 18:35.279
or ScopaMed UltriTech,
where is the difference?

18:36.600 --> 18:38.637
what you merely as a Funk?

18:39.520 --> 18:43.100
for hundreds of years, you tell me
you want to develop a cure.

18:43.120 --> 18:44.873
but this is nothing but talk.

18:45.040 --> 18:48.780
you give blame ScopaMed,
but you know how it is in reality?

18:48.800 --> 18:50.439
do not have the courage.

18:51.200 --> 18:53.795
because it can be so,
to fail.

18:54.080 --> 18:57.060
House Wakefield, par excellence
Biochemistry his Ph.D.,

18:57.080 --> 18:59.980
can fail, with drums and trumpets
. - You are such a fool.

19:00.000 --> 19:01.460
No, I'm just honest and admit:

19:01.480 --> 19:04.980
I want a good life and
a good job. I have not hidden.

19:05.000 --> 19:08.340
I am no different from the others,
but... - and my dreams are stupid?

19:08.360 --> 19:10.397
not. Absolutely not.

19:11.200 --> 19:15.060
I would like to heartily
and with all the violence that success.

19:15.080 --> 19:19.438
but if this process does not work,
have at least try.

19:28.400 --> 19:30.100
and? What's going on?

19:30.120 --> 19:34.860
In fact, a lot of talk, but for
protein degradation is still dramatic.

19:34.880 --> 19:38.191
verify the results of the phosphate.
In writing to me, okay?

19:43.800 --> 19:45.837
house is still in the house, right?

19:47.680 --> 19:49.700
minutes before and she was still there, but...

19:49.720 --> 19:52.140
have für'n few hours
leave the company,

19:52.160 --> 19:55.790
and I in need of a deputy.
- Clear. Yes, I do.

19:56.480 --> 19:57.630
house!

20:01.840 --> 20:03.140
pause for a moment?

20:03.160 --> 20:06.100
in fact I wanted to today's times
time to go home.

20:06.120 --> 20:07.952
please.
Only for two hours.

20:11.720 --> 20:12.949
Well. Okay.

20:47.200 --> 20:48.714
hello, my friend.

21:01.800 --> 21:03.837
like last time.

21:13.360 --> 21:16.380
must now

21:16.400 --> 21:19.140
our
bake chocolate cake with cream paint,

21:19.160 --> 21:20.740
and I still have
jelly beans draufgepackt.

21:20.760 --> 21:22.380
he likes, such as licorice flavor.

21:22.400 --> 21:25.100
he might again today
home, is not it? - I'm sorry, no.

21:25.120 --> 21:27.740
We spent only
perform EKG and...

21:27.760 --> 21:30.780
now unpleasant side effects of chemotherapy

21:30.800 --> 21:34.620
is an increased risk of heart attack .
- and this means in plain text?

21:34.640 --> 21:37.980
chemotherapy
hurt the heart of your husband.

21:38.000 --> 21:40.469
that heart disease is not curable.

21:44.840 --> 21:49.260
in eight months, and he is
cancer and chemotherapy

21:49.280 --> 21:51.820
shade
become his country.

21:51.840 --> 21:54.540
in a lot of blood...
and he had to pass the time.

21:54.560 --> 21:57.060
says he does not care as long as he
only survived, and now...

21:57.080 --> 21:59.700
since you tell me if
survived cancer,

21:59.720 --> 22:01.900
then died of heart disease?

22:01.920 --> 22:05.072
our drug,
still keep it stable for a period of time...

22:09.480 --> 22:12.140
Thank you stayed with it,
you certainly have a lot to do.

22:12.160 --> 22:13.660
sorry. - It's okay.

22:13.680 --> 22:16.100
house and we go home.
- What about the father?

22:16.120 --> 22:18.999
and he can not even with.
Was probably come tomorrow.

22:19.240 --> 22:23.154
But you promised me, he comes home after
. - Yes, I know. But unfortunately...

22:28.240 --> 22:30.038
you would be so kind again?

22:30.320 --> 22:31.780
you'd better stay here.

22:31.800 --> 22:35.060
left me! -
Mother and father but cares.

22:35.080 --> 22:36.380
left me!

22:36.400 --> 22:38.232
house. House?

22:41.040 --> 22:43.475
you know what about
cell cultures missing?

22:46.200 --> 22:48.032
Ted is it will not back yet?

22:49.440 --> 22:53.593
Oh great. Well, so should
yet to come, and I ask for time.

22:55.400 --> 22:56.500
Pat here.

22:56.520 --> 23:00.060
hello. We expect actually still
delivery. Tonight.

23:00.080 --> 23:02.940
Do you have the application number?
- No. organized TED.

23:02.960 --> 23:06.476
if it happens to you
passed? - No, not yet.

23:07.680 --> 23:11.220
well, then he is still in the workplace,
Could you please put me through to him?

23:11.240 --> 23:14.620
The way I see it here, he was one and a half hours
sixth in the basement.

23:14.640 --> 23:16.500
sixth in the basement?

23:16.520 --> 23:19.980
Are you sure? This is quite
closed for many years.

23:20.000 --> 23:22.037
have anyway on the screen.

23:22.920 --> 23:26.300
Well, you could probably go down
and ask him about the number?

23:26.320 --> 23:29.940
I like to do,
but we do not have access even down there.

23:29.960 --> 23:34.273
Well. If you see him, tell him,
he wants to call me? - If I did.

23:37.320 --> 23:38.515
and?

23:39.280 --> 23:41.033
and he is still on the road.

23:50.960 --> 23:52.838
thousand dollars immediately.

23:56.320 --> 24:00.439
then again
1000 $ after treatment.

24:26.720 --> 24:32.239
During the treatment you need
stay here in this room.

24:35.520 --> 24:38.354
be done on your own personal safety.

25:03.640 --> 25:05.677
I will not hurt you.

25:08.760 --> 25:10.672
lie down on the bed again.

25:11.960 --> 25:13.792
take fucking money back.

25:56.880 --> 25:58.473
post again.

25:59.480 --> 26:01.039
we call it today?

26:06.720 --> 26:08.540
Ryan and honest...

26:08.560 --> 26:11.980
... Do you really think
UltriTech funded research?

26:12.000 --> 26:13.980
say so,
fell as your name, I saw,

26:14.000 --> 26:17.152
as if they had just
super jackpot in Las cracked.

26:22.720 --> 26:24.871
Well, I'm with you. - Really?

26:26.080 --> 26:27.340
just like that?

26:27.360 --> 26:32.380
and you do not want to only two or three
nights sleeping on it for safety reasons?

26:32.400 --> 26:34.995
not.
No, you're right.

26:37.160 --> 26:41.632
I want to continue with the search and
I've been waiting a very long time.

26:43.440 --> 26:44.760
I was scared.

26:45.720 --> 26:49.740
I was afraid if I were not successful, DASS ..

26:49.760 --> 26:51.991
Hey, you know, you're not alone.

26:55.200 --> 26:56.520
right.

26:57.800 --> 26:59.120
Thank you.

27:07.400 --> 27:09.460
New York is sure to please you.

27:09.480 --> 27:13.100
I know a little bit of pizza
on the Lower East Side, where...

27:13.120 --> 27:16.460
you could have been thinking,
to live in the state of Montana?

27:16.480 --> 27:20.918
on your farm? - Lack of guidance yet
of course, but maybe in the future.

27:23.480 --> 27:25.860
so you before,
to settle?

27:25.880 --> 27:28.060
No, I'm just asking because...

27:28.080 --> 27:32.180
Now, before you ask any further,
should not correct to kneel?

27:32.200 --> 27:37.958
No, I want you, but no application
make, it's just a question for you.

27:43.320 --> 27:44.959
should I do it?

27:46.280 --> 27:48.033
what a marriage proposal?

27:48.960 --> 27:51.839
Why? You've got to
do not happen to have a ring there?

27:53.160 --> 27:54.594
not.

27:55.760 --> 27:59.151
but I know the mortgagee in
James Wall, who may still have homework.

28:04.040 --> 28:05.872
really? - Yes.

28:07.920 --> 28:09.354
really.

28:21.320 --> 28:22.470
Ted!

28:24.400 --> 28:25.820
Hey, you glow Yes.

28:25.840 --> 28:27.980
have infected me with the virus.

28:28.000 --> 28:30.540
Oh, my God. And how?
- Is completely unimportant.

28:30.560 --> 28:33.820
I'll call an ambulance.
- They can not do anything for me. - Is right.

28:33.840 --> 28:35.700
only one thing still preserves life.

28:35.720 --> 28:38.140
and that would be?
- Go to my computer.

28:38.160 --> 28:42.518
use the following login data!
Username: Lionel Stanton.

28:44.280 --> 28:46.476
Password: Asagolabius.

28:47.960 --> 28:49.580
O God, your hand.

28:49.600 --> 28:53.435
I think I broke three fingers.
- on the one hand I connect you at the moment.

28:54.880 --> 28:57.440
I'm sorry,
I want you both there with reinziehen.

28:59.760 --> 29:01.433
ACCESS TO secure files

29:02.920 --> 29:03.592
AP: Laboratory 18.24
station security camera

29:04.760 --> 29:07.060
a file should be called DCA.

29:07.080 --> 29:09.140
Have you found it? - Yes!

29:09.160 --> 29:10.719
Yes, I think so.

29:11.080 --> 29:13.060
in any section
been designed for?

29:13.080 --> 29:15.100
Thus, the molecular structure
I've never seen.

29:15.120 --> 29:17.271
This is the active ingredient of the drug.

29:18.680 --> 29:20.340
for one, that cures cancer.

29:20.360 --> 29:21.714
you Schweinepriester.

29:22.320 --> 29:24.516
I just said "the treatment of cancer?"

29:28.600 --> 29:30.637
moment. Wait a minute.

29:35.520 --> 29:36.900
so...

29:36.920 --> 29:41.278
claim that through this molecule
here is cured cancer?

29:47.480 --> 29:51.220
Oh my God, this is incredible.

29:51.240 --> 29:52.390
who developed it?

29:56.080 --> 29:57.753
Lionel.

30:00.640 --> 30:01.900
Lionel?

30:01.920 --> 30:04.060
that does not make any sense.

30:04.080 --> 30:07.700
I mean, a cure for cancer,
so you can earn billions.

30:07.720 --> 30:09.860
we can make billions already.

30:09.880 --> 30:11.940
If this drug comes
cancer than ever before in the market...

30:11.960 --> 30:15.020
then no one needs to
chemotherapy drugs we have.

30:15.040 --> 30:17.396
SopaMed
will probably bankrupt.

30:21.280 --> 30:22.873
Since when?

30:26.040 --> 30:27.952
How long have you had?

30:32.640 --> 30:34.120
Since when, Ted?

30:38.000 --> 30:39.832
for a ten-year-old.

30:40.760 --> 30:41.830
shit.

30:47.320 --> 30:50.420
you also only have the slightest idea,

30:50.440 --> 30:54.380
how many people at this time
have suffered and belted miserable?

30:54.400 --> 30:58.140
km from children's
was terrible as they lose their parents?

30:58.160 --> 31:00.500
How many
mothers and fathers were forced to

31:00.520 --> 31:04.140
just watch her swoon,
how their children suffered the torment of hell,

31:04.160 --> 31:08.580
and you have a chance to finish it?
- I know only that very year.

31:08.600 --> 31:11.877
I did not have any choice, my son...
- not! Puke on me!

31:16.400 --> 31:17.740
FILE ON USB STICK COPY

31:17.760 --> 31:19.620
finish

31:19.640 --> 31:23.620
What do you do? - I'm doing this,
what you are before a ten-year-old has had to do!

31:23.640 --> 31:25.677
will publish it. - Wait.

31:26.720 --> 31:27.551
18 laboratory BLOCK?
Yes - No

31:28.920 --> 31:30.940
wait!
Let's look briefly again.

31:30.960 --> 31:33.340
What is there to think about?
- you want to publish a simple?

31:33.360 --> 31:36.432
This is not a question!
- For anyone but deserves recognition.

31:36.880 --> 31:38.260
Why?

31:38.280 --> 31:41.591
want me to write:
in love, for you, Lionel Stanton?

31:42.640 --> 31:46.260
not. - And I will be anonymous
download server of the University, which is fine.

31:46.280 --> 31:49.820
I just say, house,
were not actually have thought through.

31:49.840 --> 31:51.479
this is a big deal.

31:52.440 --> 31:55.940
cure for cancer
there is a Nobel Prize.

31:55.960 --> 31:57.540
Ryan.

31:57.560 --> 32:02.820
people who are dying, and we can put an end to
, and in fact now.

32:02.840 --> 32:06.595
I know. I know that, but what if it did not work
stuff?

32:07.800 --> 32:10.180
thinking about the millions of patients
people in this world.

32:10.200 --> 32:13.955
What if you put into the net
then nothing worth?

32:15.280 --> 32:17.636
would be better if we know for sure.

32:18.280 --> 32:19.794
right?

32:22.160 --> 32:24.277
how long it takes to manufacture?

32:25.320 --> 32:26.959
about forty minutes.

32:45.120 --> 32:46.952
I have a job for you and your team.

32:47.480 --> 32:49.420
when? - At the moment.

32:49.440 --> 32:53.100
If you've passed through the main gate,
moved to the back of the building.

32:53.120 --> 32:56.820
in the loading dock, and you will find a box
with everything you need for the job.

32:56.840 --> 32:59.500
Where is the target?
- Laboratory eighteen.

32:59.520 --> 33:03.196
symbols GPS data and access
you will find in the package.

33:03.640 --> 33:07.680
and do not forget Yes,
must look like an accident.

33:08.880 --> 33:10.380
and how they look?

33:10.400 --> 33:12.869
very good.
Just two steps to the goal.

33:15.520 --> 33:16.715
We are on the road.

33:19.640 --> 33:21.860
VIRUS ALERT
check - news

33:21.880 --> 33:24.679
VIRUS ALERT TRIGGER?
Yes - No

33:27.960 --> 33:30.520
virus has broken out
So the alarm!

33:32.200 --> 33:33.420
not!

33:33.440 --> 33:37.620
you must bring it to an end. - If we
are dead, we offer something to the end!

33:37.640 --> 33:38.940
Ryan!

33:38.960 --> 33:40.792
will come back.

33:41.440 --> 33:42.430
come.

33:42.960 --> 33:43.518
Access Denied

33:44.560 --> 33:47.100
my card does not work!
- Tried my visits. - For the moment.

33:47.120 --> 33:47.632
Access Denied

33:51.000 --> 33:52.180
Hey!

33:52.200 --> 33:53.350
we are still here!

33:57.480 --> 33:59.460
spread your
your men into two groups,

33:59.480 --> 34:01.676
and gives each floor
down from the fifth floor.

34:18.639 --> 34:19.960
Hey! - Hey!
- Get us out of here!

34:22.120 --> 34:25.100
is to break down the door! Help!

34:25.120 --> 34:26.600
us out!

34:27.280 --> 34:29.397
This has no purpose,
they're all gone.

34:31.920 --> 34:33.239
wait, I have an idea!

34:36.120 --> 34:38.396
I have this range already
examination, and here no more.

34:41.120 --> 34:43.429
one team,
meet at the main entrance.

34:48.120 --> 34:49.270
way there, go!

34:58.960 --> 34:59.552
ACCESS-CODE 7239

35:06.320 --> 35:07.390
Come on!

35:19.520 --> 35:20.476
ALARM virus outbreak
statement: armed - a statement: NORMAL

35:24.040 --> 35:26.600
this is a good thing, right? - Of course.

35:30.280 --> 35:31.270
Hey!

35:32.520 --> 35:34.000
Did you hear that?

35:36.360 --> 35:39.420
you take care of this,
that people go to the 100 meters back.

35:39.440 --> 35:42.512
that is, the required safety distance
, okay?

35:43.800 --> 35:45.837
Come on, open the door!

35:47.600 --> 35:49.637
all of you will be a little farther back, please!

35:50.280 --> 35:53.060
I understand well,
you're all shocked.

35:53.080 --> 35:55.860
disaster management team has already arrived.

35:55.880 --> 35:58.270
currently investigating the building.

35:58.680 --> 36:02.020
but due to the risk of
may have possible contamination

36:02.040 --> 36:05.500
spread outside this area can
, nor shall any one,

36:05.520 --> 36:09.673
out of the building,
disasters give us the OK.

36:13.080 --> 36:14.434
mobile phones!

36:21.520 --> 36:23.193
moment!

36:24.720 --> 36:26.100
How do you feel?

36:26.120 --> 36:27.839
Do you have a fever, sweating her?

36:28.440 --> 36:31.740
you? - No, I feel fine.
- And that was more than ten minutes.

36:31.760 --> 36:35.913
If you have been exposed to the virus,
'd like to show her symptoms already.

36:39.400 --> 36:41.437
This has been an exercise!

36:41.920 --> 36:42.910
O God.

36:49.000 --> 36:51.740
man, I've been chasing us fear.
- Is the end of the exercise?

36:51.760 --> 36:54.580
what exercise? - That was just a practice
emergency, right?

36:54.600 --> 36:57.740
They are the ones who are still only
here and there? - Yes, I think so.

36:57.760 --> 37:00.820
we have to make sure.
- but we may have yet to come out?

37:00.840 --> 37:03.140
not, we just check
and other laboratories,

37:03.160 --> 37:05.900
person may be included.
Grant is here with you.

37:05.920 --> 37:07.195
Come on guys, let's go.

37:24.560 --> 37:25.710
ACCESS-CODE 5627

37:44.440 --> 37:47.700
I do not understand,
Why should you have to wait your search here.

37:47.720 --> 37:50.189
they are not of the disaster.

37:51.360 --> 37:53.556
what is?
- No idea.

37:54.320 --> 37:57.392
but every bet
We are the only ones here in the building.

37:59.080 --> 38:01.311
Why? It is believed about...
- and we were locked up in the lab,

38:01.480 --> 38:05.740
magnetic cards have not
works, and this is the crux of the matter?

38:05.760 --> 38:07.780
they believe there mixes with Lionel?

38:07.800 --> 38:09.359
I do not know.

38:10.040 --> 38:14.060
but I know I would not be here,
when workers come out of there.

38:14.080 --> 38:16.549
is that the only way out? - No.

38:18.880 --> 38:21.076
Is there a way. - Which one?

38:23.040 --> 38:25.316
you can see the guy from
distract us?

38:30.400 --> 38:31.470
what the heck.

38:32.040 --> 38:34.620
I would have short times to the bathroom, Grant.
- unfortunately not.

38:34.640 --> 38:38.429
is just around the corner, and if you
stand there, keep it in mind.

38:46.440 --> 38:48.830
OK, but hurry, please.

39:12.160 --> 39:13.560
it's okay.

39:14.200 --> 39:15.600
and she knows exactly what she's doing.

39:30.000 --> 39:31.878
Why are you hiding it?

39:41.480 --> 39:44.020
grant, we still
Z minus fifteen minutes.

39:44.040 --> 39:45.394
Please confirm. Ended.

39:49.800 --> 39:50.916
granted!

39:52.840 --> 39:55.799
to make your subject and then
get down to the main entrance.

40:01.400 --> 40:03.153
Where is the exit?

40:03.800 --> 40:06.020
say,
has mixed her treatment.

40:06.040 --> 40:10.220
there is no time, at any moment and
back, tell us immediately. - Do not!

40:10.240 --> 40:12.277
not without drugs.

40:14.040 --> 40:17.900
Where are you going? - Back to the lab
I do not leave here without this formula away.

40:17.920 --> 40:20.435
find another way out. - House!

40:20.800 --> 40:21.870
house!

40:25.840 --> 40:26.910
okay.

40:35.600 --> 40:37.420
grant, do you hear me?

40:37.440 --> 40:39.660
can not even be too far away.

40:39.680 --> 40:41.990
looking there,
intend region.

40:42.880 --> 40:44.075
second.

40:46.200 --> 40:47.350
there is one of these.

40:49.440 --> 40:51.272
Oh, no.
Go do not go there alone.

40:51.440 --> 40:55.116
If we all go,
notice us much sooner. You two wait here.

41:34.880 --> 41:36.200
put this away.

41:39.160 --> 41:40.879
where your friends?

41:41.280 --> 41:42.873
wait down at the entrance.

41:47.960 --> 41:51.397
I'm sorry, my friend.
Not planned to see.

42:13.080 --> 42:14.673
What did you do?

42:20.560 --> 42:22.313
I killed him.

42:28.920 --> 42:30.752
You saved my life.

42:31.640 --> 42:32.790
house.

42:33.160 --> 42:36.780
house, I would have done,
what is required, and the consideration of my face.

42:36.800 --> 42:39.380
you have done what they should do, okay?

42:39.400 --> 42:40.880
okay? Everything is fine.

42:42.280 --> 42:43.839
Oh, shit.

42:44.360 --> 42:47.820
seems that we need
serum rather than we thought.

42:47.840 --> 42:49.700
here below is the bomb.

42:49.720 --> 42:54.540
seems to be high in five minutes.
and then it will spread the virus real.

42:54.560 --> 42:57.940
we have to defuse.
- Do you know how to do it? - No.

42:57.960 --> 42:59.900
then we have to get out of here.

42:59.920 --> 43:02.380
I know
laboratory where we can finish the means.

43:02.400 --> 43:05.580
This is completely tamper.
if they really want to kill us,

43:05.600 --> 43:07.620
why they have not done
at the entrance?

43:07.640 --> 43:09.660
will kill us,
determine police.

43:09.680 --> 43:13.260
but die in the accident,
keep the secret of the tomb.

43:13.280 --> 43:15.840
No, no
If we now call the police.

43:19.760 --> 43:21.797
Let me guess.
line is dead?

43:28.000 --> 43:29.559
could be anywhere else.

43:30.360 --> 43:31.953
steal, do you hear me?

43:34.320 --> 43:37.780
this other output, as long as we need to
about until then?

43:37.800 --> 43:40.700
20 minutes, but this is the
16 minutes more than we have.

43:40.720 --> 43:42.757
so we need more time.

43:51.240 --> 43:52.515
bloody hell!

43:59.760 --> 44:01.877
I ll try with my code.

44:05.480 --> 44:07.551
curse.
Son of a bitch!

44:10.480 --> 44:14.060
one floor down there is still space
security. - What is the benefit?

44:14.080 --> 44:15.400
since we are certainly not pure.

44:16.920 --> 44:19.276
Scheißegal.
Even goes a step aside.

44:21.480 --> 44:22.980
do not think so.

44:23.000 --> 44:24.639
burn in there.

44:24.880 --> 44:27.315
how to burn?
- Fluorine, sulfur acid.

44:32.320 --> 44:35.740
Let's go grouse hunting.
- You're not going to shoot them.

44:35.760 --> 44:40.060
in less than five minutes will
virus spreads throughout the building.

44:40.080 --> 44:41.673
this does the job for us.

44:49.640 --> 44:51.120
all we have!

44:51.280 --> 44:52.634
let me times.

44:58.560 --> 45:02.634
The only question I still
can save, is the treatment. Hurry!

45:06.040 --> 45:07.190
only three minutes!

45:16.240 --> 45:17.674
clouds.

45:20.160 --> 45:21.435
45 seconds!

45:22.680 --> 45:24.080
try the other hand.

45:25.520 --> 45:26.476
nine!

45:27.000 --> 45:28.140
eight!

45:28.160 --> 45:29.140
seven!

45:29.160 --> 45:30.340
six!

45:30.360 --> 45:31.220
five!

45:31.240 --> 45:32.380
four!

45:32.400 --> 45:33.700
three!

45:33.720 --> 45:34.836
two!

45:35.200 --> 45:36.520
now!

45:53.400 --> 45:56.632
contamination detected

46:07.320 --> 46:09.860
Come .
- I forgot a little something.

46:09.880 --> 46:14.020
in the laboratory in the basement 6
you can quit.

46:14.040 --> 46:16.500
6-storey underground?
- As is the output.

46:16.520 --> 46:20.140
this is completely impossible.
- And on top of that very process.

46:20.160 --> 46:23.260
okay.
Well, then you do not believe me.

46:23.280 --> 46:26.060
but it will not be long,
even men again.

46:26.080 --> 46:28.879
you will not be very happy
when they discover their mate.

46:31.520 --> 46:35.878
be produced
treatment and I promise I will take you out of here.

46:36.520 --> 46:38.239
Well, we're in business.

46:38.680 --> 46:40.956
I want to hear it from your mouth, Beth.

46:42.160 --> 46:44.500
promised Ted. - Yes, well.

46:44.520 --> 46:45.749
very good.

46:46.240 --> 46:49.790
if I'm not to spill things,
find me rather than a plastic bottle.

47:06.400 --> 47:07.800
I have!

47:16.840 --> 47:18.320
as well, and we follow you.

47:20.040 --> 47:22.680
okay.
term here!

47:25.680 --> 47:27.592
they are there.
Come back again!

47:30.200 --> 47:33.557
we just go over there to get out!
- No, we must be disposed of somehow.

47:34.200 --> 47:37.020
okay, I do not need two
plastic bottles with screw caps.

47:37.040 --> 47:38.700
and fills it half full with warm water
.

47:38.720 --> 47:42.020
Let's talk with our man,
we will do you no harm!

47:42.040 --> 47:43.360
We know he is in there!

47:48.160 --> 47:49.753
here, and warm water.

47:52.360 --> 47:55.194
What is nonsense?
We break into the store and good.

47:59.320 --> 48:00.754
I think so too.

48:01.720 --> 48:03.393
Well, forward, boys!

48:05.280 --> 48:06.396
hunker down!

48:10.480 --> 48:12.756
they're plastic bottles only.

48:16.520 --> 48:17.715
go!

48:26.080 --> 48:28.959
the elevator does not work,
then we must take the stairs. Go!

49:03.560 --> 49:06.280
will still catch
's alive?

49:12.280 --> 49:13.953
I guess that this was "no."

49:25.240 --> 49:26.754
what's going on?

49:28.280 --> 49:29.475
cursed.

49:30.160 --> 49:31.833
to proceed, and you fucking door!

49:33.320 --> 49:36.074
I correct?
This is the only way out?

49:39.520 --> 49:42.580
in our room maintenance
floor above.

49:42.600 --> 49:44.193
since the must-have tool!

49:52.240 --> 49:53.913
have checked every room.

50:20.000 --> 50:21.753
Come on, please.

50:25.120 --> 50:28.180
hello? - Hey, boy. - Dad?

50:28.200 --> 50:29.759
we have to go very soon.

50:36.360 --> 50:39.980
You can even pack but already
and wait for me outside the front door,

50:40.000 --> 50:43.780
within a few hours and I'm there.
- you, Dad, will teach me Spanish?

50:43.800 --> 50:47.900
Why? - Speaking at a training camp
certainly all Spanish, what do you think?

50:47.920 --> 50:52.199
Yes, of course, no doubt,
course will teach Spanish.

50:52.760 --> 50:54.672
you, Reese? - Yes?

50:55.960 --> 50:57.660
I love you, my son.

50:57.680 --> 50:59.273
I love you too, Dad.

51:12.440 --> 51:13.590
bingo!

51:18.120 --> 51:20.874
do not know,
how to deal with it? - Clear.

51:22.120 --> 51:24.660
I think what.
You have shown your father.

51:24.680 --> 51:28.640
he had to wait until I was eight,
me because before the mask was too big.

51:30.040 --> 51:32.020
welding wire and mask
We also have to take with them.

51:32.040 --> 51:35.750
when we're through, we welding
the other side of the door. - A good idea.

51:54.920 --> 51:56.479
now they will have to rise.

52:15.240 --> 52:18.517
did you weld shut the door?
- There's no time!

52:30.720 --> 52:32.074
okay? - Well.

52:41.480 --> 52:42.914
blast door hinges off.

52:48.280 --> 52:51.500
everything okay? - Let me take a brief pause. -
There is no time, Ted!

52:51.520 --> 52:54.991
chemistry lab
equal right around the corner, behind the offices.

52:57.840 --> 53:00.036
should talk to you alone, Ryan.

53:01.800 --> 53:04.300
Come on, we must go.
- Should we continue?

53:04.320 --> 53:06.039
one minute more.

53:06.720 --> 53:10.180
Well, then you will get it before,
I kümmre him. - What, seriously?

53:10.200 --> 53:12.476
Yes, we immediately thereafter, Beth.

53:14.560 --> 53:15.630
okay.

53:17.600 --> 53:19.034
What is it?

53:20.840 --> 53:21.990
stick?

53:22.880 --> 53:25.140
house has a heart
absolutely in the right place,

53:25.160 --> 53:27.220
but they do not think
tomorrow is still in the future.

53:27.240 --> 53:30.620
even if we get out of here, chasing
Lionel us more, and he will never give up.

53:30.640 --> 53:34.540
if the drug on the market,
go ScopaMed broken. He said he could never be.

53:34.560 --> 53:35.676
Well.

53:37.680 --> 53:40.460
If we set ourselves apart abroad
we might have a chance

53:40.480 --> 53:43.552
but because we need coal.
- you want to sell drugs?

53:45.640 --> 53:48.460
never since they will participate.
- Of course not.

53:48.480 --> 53:53.460
but without the money and we are as good as dead
you just do not think about the future far enough.

53:53.480 --> 53:56.060
This is the reason to have a low
decision.

53:56.080 --> 54:01.030
I promise you, when you were here with
whole skin outside, they will be grateful to you.

54:05.600 --> 54:08.780
Ryan, and here no one doubts
at your wits.

54:08.800 --> 54:11.474
you're also smart enough to follow
house.

54:12.320 --> 54:15.518
I do not follow her,
applied only once.

54:16.680 --> 54:19.700
she did not tell you?
- What you can not say?

54:19.720 --> 54:23.634
she did not start with us,
If we do not offer you a job, too.

54:25.520 --> 54:27.557
thought he knew de

55:32.680 --> 55:37.500
Well, I know a few people,
may buy the agent.

55:37.520 --> 55:39.340
from? - UltriTech.

55:39.360 --> 55:42.620
UltriTech? - Not what you think
I have never been spies or so for.

55:42.640 --> 55:46.100
Ryan, I'm a huge pile of shit on
UltriTech or ScopaMed.

55:46.120 --> 55:48.060
We are all on our own.

55:48.080 --> 55:52.900
listen, I convey to you the deal UltriTech
across the stage, and we share the fifth session, okay?

55:52.920 --> 55:53.910
okay.

55:56.520 --> 55:58.876
A condition I would have. - What?

55:59.880 --> 56:02.060
agent working under my name.

56:02.080 --> 56:03.900
what you want?

56:03.920 --> 56:07.820
already clear.
And the Nobel Prize for medicine goes to Ryan Earl.

56:07.840 --> 56:11.300
A million dollars as an encore.
- It's me, but not on coal.

56:11.320 --> 56:14.060
not, in the end I want to
deserve recognition.

56:14.080 --> 56:16.820
I completely
plowed just like home.

56:16.840 --> 56:20.390
of me is the process of
to reduce side effects.

56:21.320 --> 56:25.820
Well, I agree. You reap
glories, but only if you promise

56:25.840 --> 56:28.719
you together
house means herstellst now.

56:29.280 --> 56:32.540
I've already promised.
- the house, and I have my doubts.

56:32.560 --> 56:34.995
was there once and indifferent.
And do it

56:43.280 --> 56:45.431
Well, come on. Come.

56:47.360 --> 56:52.071
moment! What were you doing here?
- What is the question?

56:52.280 --> 56:54.431
this afternoon, I've been here before!

56:54.600 --> 56:57.860
Yes, you are.

56:57.880 --> 57:01.740
I should check to see whether we can put
laboratories old repaired.

57:01.760 --> 57:05.231
I do not believe one word of what you say!

57:05.760 --> 57:08.620
Lionel has his little secret
keep a ten-year-old himself,

57:08.640 --> 57:10.950
But last year, he reveals to you.

57:12.320 --> 57:15.313
what I did,
that this man trusts you?

57:39.160 --> 57:43.200
house, and this does not help us more than that.
We need to help him.

57:43.360 --> 57:47.320
Do you trust him?
- Yes, I do.

57:54.000 --> 57:56.231
then come with me, and I have to show you something.

57:56.680 --> 57:59.140
we do not have time for that.

57:59.160 --> 58:03.871
was right.
Now we need to the lab. - Ryan! Please...

58:23.680 --> 58:27.469
We are more effective when we split.
Radio me when you find them.

58:42.160 --> 58:45.232
What the hell are you doing?
- Ryan, are you following me easy!

59:39.920 --> 59:41.991
Do you still believe in the story of Ted?

01:00:05.840 --> 01:00:07.797
it dead

01:00:08.440 --> 01:00:10.033

01:01:44.920 --> 01:01:47.020

01:01:47.040 --> 01:01:49.157
Yes. - Let's go.

that's okay, I have a formula.

01:02:12.760 --> 01:02:14.080
thankfully.

01:02:15.320 --> 01:02:16.834
we lack a two-step, yes?

01:02:19.040 --> 01:02:21.032
we come right back, okay?

01:02:23.200 --> 01:02:25.351
House, we have to go.

01:02:42.200 --> 01:02:44.840

01:04:36.840 --> 01:04:38.540

01:04:53.120 --> 01:04:54.952
and then we can deal with it.

01:05:07.920 --> 01:05:09.240

01:05:42.360 --> 01:05:44.158

01:08:16.120 --> 01:08:18.077
Do you smell that?

01:08:24.880 --> 01:08:27.439
No, you can not smell natural.

01:08:33.520 --> 01:08:35.716
What do you mean? Spanking Me?

01:08:41.920 --> 01:08:43.912
I am a bad time?

01:09:18.640 --> 01:09:20.073
Are you okay? - Yes.

01:10:01.040 --> 01:10:04.220
Ryan!
Is finished?

Yes.

01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:10.276

there is less smoke.

01:10:40.680 --> 01:10:42.580
Clarissa?

01:10:42.600 --> 01:10:44.557
Clarissa, this is done, I have medicine!

01:10:45.560 --> 01:10:49.315
Clarissa?
Oh no! No, no, no!

01:10:49.720 --> 01:10:51.359
Hey, Clarissa!

01:10:54.640 --> 01:10:55.835
Clarissa!

01:11:06.800 --> 01:11:08.519
What about the father?

01:11:09.280 --> 01:11:11.636
but you promised me,
when he gets home!

01:11:13.200 --> 01:11:15.112
you'd better stay here.
- Leaving me!

01:11:16.920 --> 01:11:19.640
left me!
- No, wait!

01:11:47.840 --> 01:11:51.197
you know I just formula
you downloaded on your laptop above. - Yes.

01:11:51.400 --> 01:11:54.438
I find myself on the corporate network,
also have access from here.

01:11:56.120 --> 01:11:57.156
O God...

01:12:00.320 --> 01:12:01.549
here is...

01:12:05.360 --> 01:12:08.114
shit, but here there is no cable network!

01:12:08.800 --> 01:12:11.076
from here is not in his power in the laptop!

01:12:13.040 --> 01:12:15.900
What is there to think about?
- you simply want to publish?

01:12:15.920 --> 01:12:18.833
Yes, this is probably not a question!
- For anyone but deserves recognition!

01:12:21.880 --> 01:12:24.620
this does not help us.
We need to help him.

01:12:24.640 --> 01:12:26.313
Do you trust him?

01:12:26.480 --> 01:12:28.199
Yes, I do.

01:12:35.240 --> 01:12:36.390
God!

01:12:47.800 --> 01:12:49.120
stop it!

01:12:53.920 --> 01:12:56.754
What do you do?
- I want the formula!

01:12:58.000 --> 01:13:02.358
Write a comment
- I've had to have all the time!

01:13:02.560 --> 01:13:04.677
It's not what you think...

01:13:05.960 --> 01:13:07.519
Why lie to me?

01:13:10.640 --> 01:13:12.916
tell her the truth, Ryan.

01:13:13.240 --> 01:13:16.780
we decided to sell the formula to UltriTech

01:13:16.800 --> 01:13:18.951
and earnings per share.

01:13:21.600 --> 01:13:24.274
house, I've done it for us.

01:13:25.320 --> 01:13:28.820
Lionel is not us but
just let them get away!

01:13:28.840 --> 01:13:31.380
That's why we need money
for a new life, 'understand it yet!

01:13:31.400 --> 01:13:34.950
Are you crazy?
- please! Think about it!

01:13:36.520 --> 01:13:38.318
How can you?

01:13:39.960 --> 01:13:45.860
millions of people at this moment in the family home medical, and

01:13:45.880 --> 01:13:49.078
and hope and pray
because they desire

01:13:49.240 --> 01:13:51.072
one week just to live longer.

01:13:51.280 --> 01:13:55.672
only one day
or just an hour!

01:14:00.320 --> 01:14:05.873
parents who did not experience how
register their daughters to college.

01:14:06.680 --> 01:14:09.070
not to mention the graduation ceremony...

01:14:11.680 --> 01:14:14.240
you also do not know who she married.

01:14:15.280 --> 01:14:18.910

01:14:28.880 --> 01:14:33.432
not.
do not do it, please.

01:14:52.360 --> 01:14:53.953
Oh my God!

01:14:56.160 --> 01:14:58.470
I'm so sorry incredibly!

01:15:08.560 --> 01:15:12.952
my son Reese...

01:15:15.960 --> 01:15:20.079
he had a brain tumor,
was unfit for work altogether.

01:15:21.640 --> 01:15:26.237
A year ago, he had then
of bleeding in the brain sharp.

01:15:29.400 --> 01:15:32.740
Lionel did not,
he would have died from it.

01:15:32.760 --> 01:15:35.500
gave me medicine,
If you're in the back

01:15:35.520 --> 01:15:37.740
illegal human experiments that lead.

01:15:37.760 --> 01:15:40.480
I've let myself in it.

01:15:42.080 --> 01:15:45.232
I never wanted to,
that someone takes damage.

01:15:47.320 --> 01:15:52.315
I just wanted my son to live on.

01:15:57.840 --> 01:16:03.711
today, has asked him to do it again.
He threatened to kill Reese.

01:16:05.520 --> 01:16:07.352
I did not have any choice.

01:16:08.680 --> 01:16:11.912
have hopes that I could get away with Reese.

01:16:12.800 --> 01:16:15.100
start a whole new life.

01:16:15.120 --> 01:16:17.476
in a distant land.

01:16:18.880 --> 01:16:21.076
What a silly idea.

01:16:22.400 --> 01:16:25.598
for the rest of our lives we have been on the run!

01:16:27.000 --> 01:16:30.596
was constantly lived in fear of our pursuers.

01:16:31.040 --> 01:16:33.271
this is not the life for him.

01:16:34.920 --> 01:16:38.470
it's worth, but why...

01:16:40.240 --> 01:16:41.959
... better.

01:17:05.240 --> 01:17:06.959
Thank you.

01:17:09.040 --> 01:17:12.829

01:17:17.680 --> 01:17:20.718
wait, and I'll help you. - No, that's okay.

01:17:21.160 --> 01:17:24.870
skin of representation Yes
not so fast, and drugs.

01:17:36.280 --> 01:17:40.957
you must first past offices,
then the second door on the right.

01:17:42.040 --> 01:17:45.477
the way to the tunnel emergency
through the boiler room.

01:17:46.000 --> 01:17:49.710
because the right and again,
and follows through to the end of the tunnel.

01:17:50.560 --> 01:17:52.313
then I came in the woods.

01:18:15.840 --> 01:18:18.878
early to practice football, is not it?

01:18:38.640 --> 01:18:39.756
Come on.

01:19:12.480 --> 01:19:15.279
and you are absolutely sure
we are here is not it?

01:19:15.800 --> 01:19:18.599
he says:
tunnel emergency is right at the back. - Hey!

01:19:20.200 --> 01:19:21.714
moment! Moment.

01:19:25.160 --> 01:19:28.631
This is a drug.
Without the virus will kill you!

01:19:28.800 --> 01:19:31.998
and you might be,
but let's run.

01:19:32.280 --> 01:19:34.875
your negotiating position is unfortunately not very favorable.

01:19:35.440 --> 01:19:37.397
take this.

01:19:38.600 --> 01:19:40.980
take over!

01:19:41.000 --> 01:19:42.229

I still infected for a long time.

01:20:09.680 --> 01:20:11.512
I'll get you a syringe. - Do not!

01:20:11.680 --> 01:20:14.260
please think after.

01:20:14.280 --> 01:20:16.954
you've got the formula!
but if it kills you,

01:20:17.200 --> 01:20:20.113
people will never learn.
you have to get out of here!

01:20:20.320 --> 01:20:23.180

01:20:23.200 --> 01:20:24.714

listen, you take Das.

01:20:29.600 --> 01:20:33.660
and whatever happens,
not come again.

01:20:33.680 --> 01:20:35.140
do not go! Ryan!

01:20:35.160 --> 01:20:36.310
Ryan!

01:21:04.800 --> 01:21:06.598
O God...

01:21:15.800 --> 01:21:18.076
Come...

01:21:20.720 --> 01:21:26.000

Air here is great.

01:21:33.480 --> 01:21:35.472
hello to you in the party, pal.

01:22:03.280 --> 01:22:04.919
Do you have a call? - No.

01:22:08.280 --> 01:22:11.956
our team handles it already.
Hey, you have no power here!

01:22:13.280 --> 01:22:15.431
Mr. Lionel Stanton? - Yes.

01:22:15.600 --> 01:22:17.717

01:24:01.960 --> 01:24:04.077
No, wait!

01:24:49.320 --> 01:24:51.152
you may do so.

01:25:01.640 --> 01:25:06.954
and jelly beans......

01:25:30.640 --> 01:25:32.597
Well, you're sleepy?

01:25:36.840 --> 01:25:39.071
Finally you're awake again.

01:25:40.560 --> 01:25:43.234
hurt you...
- No, I'm fine.

01:25:45.400 --> 01:25:47.220
when I was gone?

01:25:47.240 --> 01:25:49.357
four days.

01:25:57.520 --> 01:25:59.512
and Ted?

01:26:03.160 --> 01:26:04.389
not.

01:26:12.920 --> 01:26:15.958
I found it here with you in the woods.

01:26:18.960 --> 01:26:21.600
and I think that belongs to you.

01:26:24.280 --> 01:26:27.239
not.

01:26:27.920 --> 01:26:30.754
all people in the world to which it belongs.

01:26:43.520 --> 01:26:45.900
As I mentioned earlier today and the two universities

01:26:45.920 --> 01:26:49.740
mysterious formula by e
received from an anonymous sender.

01:26:49.760 --> 01:26:53.300
it seems, and this is in fact
to be an effective drug for cancer.

01:26:53.320 --> 01:26:55.700
course, even
need extensive testing

01:26:55.720 --> 01:26:58.820
but at the moment there are all the important breakthrough
about.

01:26:58.840 --> 01:27:01.620
yesterday
held 9 Montana Beer Festival

01:27:01.640 --> 01:27:03.836
The crowd was phenomenal as always.

01:27:33.760 --> 01:27:38.460
in memory of Ellen Gould and all the brave souls who fought
against cancer.

01:27:38.480 --> 01:27:40.870
hope we find one day in the drug.
