WEBVTT

00:23.106 --> 00:24.721
(FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING)

00:24.816 --> 00:28.274
Mr. Randall?
They're here.

00:45.379 --> 00:47.540
Fifty-two million
includes over six million

00:47.631 --> 00:50.088
already issued
pursuant to the
over-allotment option.

00:50.175 --> 00:51.506
When can we close?

00:51.593 --> 00:55.051
It would be subject
to regulatory approval
in both Toronto...

00:55.138 --> 00:57.800
I didn't say how,
Oliver, I said when.

00:58.642 --> 00:59.802
What?

00:59.893 --> 01:02.760
You sure this is
a direction you
want to go, Roy?

01:02.854 --> 01:05.391
This would move us
from energy service
into energy...

01:05.482 --> 01:06.892
You don't think
oil's going up?

01:06.984 --> 01:09.066
Of course it's gonna go up.
The question is when.

01:09.152 --> 01:10.278
The question
is always when.

01:10.362 --> 01:12.819
And if we wait until
the deal makes sense
to everyone else,

01:12.906 --> 01:15.864
we're gonna be waiting
in line behind
everyone else.

01:15.951 --> 01:16.986
All I'm saying is...

01:17.077 --> 01:19.989
The same cover-your-ass crap
you always say.

01:21.123 --> 01:22.863
We're gonna have
to wrap this up.
I gotta go.

01:22.958 --> 01:24.414
Where are you going?
ROY: Upstairs.

01:24.501 --> 01:26.583
Get the regulators
on it. I want to close by
the end of the month.

01:26.670 --> 01:28.706
Come on, Roy.
There are 10 other
items on the agenda.

01:28.797 --> 01:30.082
Which'll have to wait
until next week.

01:30.173 --> 01:32.084
You can't drag us
all out of the office,

01:32.175 --> 01:34.552
get halfway through,
and then just kick us out.

01:34.636 --> 01:36.012
Yeah, I can.

02:01.538 --> 02:03.494
(BEEPING)

02:03.582 --> 02:05.538
DR. JOHNSON: The antibiotic
treatment had no effect.

02:05.626 --> 02:07.958
Both the fever
and the pain are
getting worse,

02:08.045 --> 02:11.037
which means
it's not Clostridium
difficile.

02:11.590 --> 02:14.206
But you said that
was the only diagnosis
that made sense.

02:18.055 --> 02:19.215
JACK: Dad.

02:24.186 --> 02:25.892
I don't want to go.

02:26.438 --> 02:30.397
I know, buddy.
But we may need to.

02:31.485 --> 02:33.476
Am I gonna die?

02:33.570 --> 02:36.403
No. Of course not.

02:38.241 --> 02:39.777
How do you know?

02:40.744 --> 02:42.860
Well, ljust do.

02:44.956 --> 02:47.333
And I'm always right,
aren't I?

02:48.919 --> 02:50.079
Yeah.

03:26.498 --> 03:28.079
I want House.

03:28.166 --> 03:31.579
I understand,
but I told you Dr. House
isn't available.

03:31.670 --> 03:32.750
Dr...
Call him.

03:32.838 --> 03:36.922
Tell him I'll have
a private jet pick him up
from whatever island...

03:37.008 --> 03:40.000
He isn't on vacation.
Dr. Foreman is one
of our best doctors.

03:40.095 --> 03:41.551
ls House in jail?

03:41.638 --> 03:46.132
No. Foreman is currently
working with two of House's
most veteran associates.

03:46.226 --> 03:47.466
Rehab?

03:47.561 --> 03:48.721
No.

03:49.396 --> 03:51.808
Mr. Randall,
your son will be
in good hands.

03:51.898 --> 03:53.354
My son

03:55.068 --> 03:58.435
has already been
in good hands,
and he's still dying.

03:59.072 --> 04:00.573
l'm through
dealing with good.

04:00.657 --> 04:04.866
I want the best,
and everyone I've asked
says that's House.

04:05.412 --> 04:09.030
So unless he's dead,
comatose, or insane,

04:09.124 --> 04:13.333
I want him treating
my son today.

04:19.217 --> 04:22.004
You could have said no
in good conscience.

04:22.095 --> 04:24.051
The kid” still be
Foreman's patient,

04:24.139 --> 04:26.596
but his dad wants you
making the decisions.

04:26.683 --> 04:28.048
Then he's not my patient.

04:28.143 --> 04:31.761
You want to give me none
of the responsibility
and all of the liability?

04:31.855 --> 04:33.720
Which means I get...

04:34.566 --> 04:35.897
Oh, cool.

04:37.611 --> 04:40.193
Don't let him do
anything crazy.

04:40.280 --> 04:43.397
When is he getting
his license back so we can
stop playing this game?

04:43.492 --> 04:45.824
Maybe never.
This game is fun.

04:46.661 --> 04:48.868
You also need to prepare
President Dibala's case

04:48.955 --> 04:51.992
for this week's
Morbidity and Mortality
conference.

04:52.667 --> 04:55.909
Oh, unfortunately,
I'm overdue on
a mani-pedi appointment.

04:56.004 --> 04:58.370
Not you,
Foreman's department.

04:58.465 --> 05:01.298
Oh, right. Well,
he's got all the time
in the world.

05:01.384 --> 05:04.797
We made the wrong call,
he died, there's
nothing to present.

05:04.888 --> 05:06.799
lt obviously garnered
a lot of curiosity.

05:06.890 --> 05:08.596
And we don't have more
important things to do

05:08.683 --> 05:11.174
than satisfy everyone's
idle curiosity?

05:11.269 --> 05:12.725
It's not idle.

05:12.813 --> 05:15.976
The question of how
we deal with two
possible diagnoses

05:16.066 --> 05:19.604
whose treatments
are contraindicated
is worth discussing.

05:21.571 --> 05:24.483
Abdominal pain
increasing in severity
and frequency,

05:24.574 --> 05:27.486
fever, dehydration,
diarrhea, weight loss.

05:27.577 --> 05:30.114
Mom died from kidney failure
caused by type 1 diabetes,

05:30.205 --> 05:31.194
which has been ruled out.

05:31.289 --> 05:33.154
HOUSE: Seventeen doctors.

05:33.250 --> 05:36.834
Everything's been ruled out,
which means we have
to re-rule out.

05:36.920 --> 05:41.414
Get a new history
and physical. Unless
that's crazy, boss.

05:43.510 --> 05:46.752
Been out of the country
or on any recent
camping trips?

05:46.847 --> 05:50.339
No camping.
But we were in Montreal
back in January.

05:50.433 --> 05:53.140
We went to see
the NHL All-Star Game
for my birthday.

05:53.228 --> 05:54.513
Awesome.

05:56.064 --> 05:57.349
Where's Dr. House?

05:57.440 --> 05:58.976
In his office.

05:59.067 --> 06:01.729
He's really more of
a decider than a doer.

06:01.820 --> 06:03.811
He's decided we
should start over.

06:03.905 --> 06:07.238
You never know
what previous doctors
may have missed.

06:09.953 --> 06:11.284
Like this.

06:11.913 --> 06:13.949
Does that hurt more
when I push there?

06:14.040 --> 06:15.325
Not really.

06:15.417 --> 06:16.873
What is it?

06:17.794 --> 06:19.409
I'm not sure.

06:19.713 --> 06:21.829
Just keep it clean,
simple.

06:21.923 --> 06:24.585
We did a test that
called into question
our initial diagnosis,

06:24.676 --> 06:26.086
so we changed our mind.

06:26.177 --> 06:28.634
And if they ask how
the test was done?

06:28.722 --> 06:30.883
Why would they do that?
It's a routine lab test.

06:30.974 --> 06:34.387
Routine lab tests
don't involve blood
you stole from a corpse

06:34.477 --> 06:36.559
to trick me into
giving the guy
the wrong treatment.

06:36.646 --> 06:38.147
Yes, and if you
brought that up,

06:38.231 --> 06:39.732
it'd certainly make
for a lively debate

06:39.816 --> 06:42.148
about the morality
of murdering murderers.

06:42.235 --> 06:44.066
But since you
burned the only
evidence of that...

06:44.154 --> 06:46.065
To cover for you,
not me.

06:46.156 --> 06:48.989
You're protected.
The decision
was a coin flip.

06:49.075 --> 06:51.566
There was no right
or wrong answer.

06:52.162 --> 06:56.576
The body's underground,
8,000 miles away.
Nobody can prove anything.

06:56.666 --> 06:59.282
That room will be filled,
not because of a coin flip,

06:59.377 --> 07:03.120
not because of the patient,
but because House's
department screwed up.

07:03.214 --> 07:06.126
They're gonna be like
sharks in a chum-filled
swimming pool,

07:06.217 --> 07:10.176
and there's no way
I'm jumping in unless
I'm in a steel cage.

07:11.056 --> 07:12.262
So what do you want?

07:12.349 --> 07:15.056
I want to know
you have
everything covered.

07:15.143 --> 07:16.758
HOUSE: Got what covered?

07:18.605 --> 07:20.436
We're just reviewing
the Dibala case.

07:20.523 --> 07:23.060
Making sure we
didn't miss anything.

07:23.151 --> 07:26.689
We didn't.
Except, of course,
the thing that killed him.

07:28.198 --> 07:29.938
CAMERON: He's constipated.

07:30.033 --> 07:32.775
Physical revealed
a mass in his abdomen,
so I repeated the X-ray.

07:32.869 --> 07:36.407
Old one was clean, new one
shows that his colon is
almost completely impacted.

07:36.498 --> 07:39.285
Obstruction would
explain the pain.

07:39.376 --> 07:42.038
You think
theyjust screwed up
the old X-ray?

07:42.128 --> 07:43.288
Nope.

07:46.132 --> 07:47.633
Hirschsprung's?

07:47.717 --> 07:50.504
It's a congenital disorder
of the nerves in the colon.

07:50.595 --> 07:52.335
Very rare in a child
your son's age.

07:52.430 --> 07:54.011
Most doctors would
never think of it.

07:54.099 --> 07:55.339
And you came up
with this?

07:55.433 --> 07:56.468
lt's House's idea.

07:56.559 --> 07:58.686
We need a barium enema
and biopsy to confirm.

07:58.770 --> 08:02.354
Let me guess,
it tastes really bad,

08:02.440 --> 08:04.351
but it's gonna make
me feel a lot better.

08:06.736 --> 08:09.227
Actually, you're not
gonna taste it.

08:20.709 --> 08:24.372
You should try searching for
"Misty May digs for gold."

08:24.629 --> 08:26.915
Make sure you
put it in quotes.

08:27.257 --> 08:29.339
I'm making travel plans.

08:29.426 --> 08:32.918
| just need to get away,
have some time to myself.

08:33.763 --> 08:35.503
You getting the hint?

08:36.933 --> 08:38.434
So that's it?

08:39.853 --> 08:42.686
You're done with
your little experiment
with Foreman?

08:42.772 --> 08:45.514
It wasn't an experiment,
it was a relationship.

08:45.608 --> 08:47.769
You may wanna look
into the difference.

08:50.447 --> 08:52.688
I'm glad you're
better, House.

08:52.782 --> 08:56.866
I actually liked
working for you, but
I'm not coming back.

08:56.953 --> 08:58.113
Good.

08:58.747 --> 09:00.362
Because if you came back,

09:00.457 --> 09:02.743
Foreman would try
and save the relationship,

09:02.834 --> 09:05.166
and he'd give up
being the boss.

09:05.628 --> 09:08.665
Are you here to try
to save my relationship
with Foreman?

09:08.757 --> 09:12.375
God, no. I'm trying
to save my relationship
with Foreman.

09:12.469 --> 09:16.963
Right now, I'm Kobe,
playing the game I love,
however the hell I want,

09:17.640 --> 09:20.928
and Phil Jackson has
to listen to everyone
else bitch about it.

09:21.019 --> 09:22.429
Enjoy Cabo.

09:26.149 --> 09:27.980
I'm going to Thailand.

09:29.319 --> 09:30.479
Really?

09:31.154 --> 09:32.735
Interesting.

09:32.822 --> 09:34.323
Goodbye, House.

09:35.408 --> 09:37.114
Goodbye, Thirteen.

09:39.788 --> 09:42.871
Last week,
yesterday, today.

the first time in months,
he's even hungry.

09:47.921 --> 09:49.252
l'm starving.

09:49.339 --> 09:50.795
We're still waiting
for the biopsy results,

09:50.882 --> 09:52.292
but obviously
it's a good sign.

09:52.383 --> 09:53.759
You're gonna
want to take it slow.

09:53.843 --> 09:57.176
Don't try to regain
all the lost weight
in one meal.

09:59.057 --> 10:00.137

10:00.225 --> 10:03.342

feels normal,
but looks bigger.

10:03.853 --> 10:08.688

and turn off the lights.

you to step back.

He's got intracranial

Push 500 milligrams
of phenytoin.

10:38.596 --> 10:40.587
You can't push that much.
We gotta relieve the pressure,

10:40.682 --> 10:41.717
or his brain can herniate.

10:54.070 --> 10:55.480
The pressure in
his skull's too high.

10:55.572 --> 10:57.654
If we don't reduce it,
it could irrevocably
damage his brain.

But he was just talking.
He was smiling.

burr holes.

any more seizures,

It's notjust his brain.

12:26.746 --> 12:30.409
He's continuing to build up
fluid in his abdominal cavity
as well as the dura.

12:30.500 --> 12:32.411
We've inserted shunts
to drain it.

12:32.502 --> 12:34.584
It's got to be some sort
of systemic infection.

12:34.671 --> 12:38.755
Not after spending
the last week getting pumped
full of IV antibiotics.

12:38.841 --> 12:41.753
You notice anything odd
about the shape
of the fluid collection?

12:41.844 --> 12:43.129
Oh, God.

12:44.597 --> 12:46.007
Virgin Mary!

12:47.350 --> 12:50.183
The edge should be
tapered, lens-shaped.

12:54.857 --> 12:59.442
Unless the dural layer
was already separated
from the brain

12:59.529 --> 13:02.020
when the fluid
started to build up.

13:02.740 --> 13:05.652
Get a dural biopsy
to confirm brain cancer.

13:07.870 --> 13:09.280
Nice catch.

13:12.375 --> 13:15.538
Bangkok.Ftht799.

13:16.504 --> 13:19.746
Wow, Bangkok.
That sounds awesome.
How long?

13:19.841 --> 13:21.331
Not sure yet.

13:22.343 --> 13:27.508
Luckily, I have a friend
who's staying at my place
taking care of my dog.

13:27.598 --> 13:31.090
He's really big,
so he needs
a lot of exercise.

13:31.185 --> 13:34.598
Remy Hadley.
H-A-D-L-E-Y.

13:34.689 --> 13:36.850
What, you think
I'm gonna rob the place?

13:36.941 --> 13:38.477
No. Of course not.

13:39.235 --> 13:41.146
In case you
haven't noticed,
I have a job.

13:41.237 --> 13:42.647
Look, I'm sorry,
I don't know you.

13:42.739 --> 13:45.481
You're either honest
or dishonest, I figured
the safer choice is to...

13:45.575 --> 13:47.611
Is to treat a stranger
like an ass.

13:47.702 --> 13:50.409
Nice way to live
your life. Bitch.

13:51.039 --> 13:52.620
I said I'm sorry.

13:52.707 --> 13:56.291
Oh! Hello. lwas wondering
if there are any Business
Class seats open

13:56.377 --> 13:59.084
that I could use
my miles to upgrade to.

13:59.756 --> 14:00.745
I don't know you,

14:00.840 --> 14:04.082
but I assumed
I could trust you,
welcomed you into my car.

14:04.177 --> 14:06.008
Okay, you're a saint.

14:06.429 --> 14:10.013
That's impossible,
I confirmed my
reservation last night.

14:10.099 --> 14:11.680
So re-book it.

14:12.602 --> 14:16.186
Well, obviously,
it was a mistake on
your end, not mine.

14:16.272 --> 14:19.230
No. I'm on my way
to the airport right now.

14:24.489 --> 14:26.605
They didn't believe you, huh?

14:31.662 --> 14:33.163
Brain cancer?

14:33.247 --> 14:35.112
We should know
for sure by the morning.

14:35.500 --> 14:36.910
(SIGHING)

14:37.001 --> 14:39.538
Our luck just keeps
getting worse, huh?

14:39.629 --> 14:41.335
Treatment options
are getting better
every day.

14:41.422 --> 14:44.209
There's no visible mass,
so even if the biopsy
comes back positive,

14:44.300 --> 14:45.415
we've caught it early.

14:45.510 --> 14:47.671
Oh, so, you're telling me
this is good news?

14:47.762 --> 14:50.344
I'm saying we will do
whatever we can.

14:51.057 --> 14:52.217
Right.

14:52.308 --> 14:53.844
(PAGER BEEPING)

14:55.478 --> 14:56.809
I'm sorry.

15:00.650 --> 15:03.141
I gotta go.
Foreman needs more
help with the M&M prep.

15:03.277 --> 15:06.235
Okay. I'll come up
and help after
I finish the biopsy.

15:06.322 --> 15:08.859
We can handle it.
I'll see you at home later.

15:08.950 --> 15:10.531
If you're here,
I might as well be.

15:10.618 --> 15:12.654
Go home.
Get some rest.

15:12.745 --> 15:15.612
'Cause I'm gonna be
waking you up as
soon as I get home.

15:22.839 --> 15:24.579
Stay out of my life.

15:25.842 --> 15:26.922
Okay.

15:27.009 --> 15:28.670
I know you canceled
my reservation.

15:28.761 --> 15:32.003
You obviously saw me log in
when you were spying on me
in the coffee shop.

15:32.098 --> 15:33.429
l was talking to you.

15:33.516 --> 15:35.347
I was spying on the MILF
in the running shorts.

15:35.435 --> 15:36.766
I'm not coming back
on the team.

15:36.853 --> 15:37.968
I don't want you
back on the team.

15:38.062 --> 15:41.725
I cannot work for, with,
or around Foreman.

15:41.816 --> 15:44.523
Which is why
I don't want you
back on the team.

15:44.610 --> 15:46.771
Now that you're
out of the picture,
he's better than ever,

15:46.863 --> 15:48.694
which is gonna make me
less miserable than ever,

15:48.781 --> 15:50.442
which is why neither
of us gives a damn

15:50.533 --> 15:53.741
how, when, or on what island
in the Bahamas you wanna
get away from it all.

15:53.828 --> 15:55.284
The Bahamas?

15:56.122 --> 15:57.282
(EXHALING)
Costa Rica?

15:57.373 --> 15:58.954
I told you, Thailand.

15:59.041 --> 16:01.168
I assumed
you were lying

16:01.252 --> 16:04.335
because it would have
been idiotic of you
to tell me the truth.

16:04.881 --> 16:07.122
Yet another reason
I have no use for you.

16:11.012 --> 16:12.548
We've got a problem.

16:12.638 --> 16:14.549
When Cameron sent
Dibala's blood to the lab,

16:14.640 --> 16:17.507
she specifically asked
for the anticentromere
antibodies test.

16:17.602 --> 16:18.808
So?

16:18.895 --> 16:22.262
The printout they sent you
included just the
anticentromere antibodies,

16:22.356 --> 16:24.642
but the lab also did
a full blood panel.

16:24.734 --> 16:26.645
So? I'm not an idiot.

16:26.736 --> 16:29.899
I obviously made sure
the cadaver I got the sample
from had the same blood type.

16:29.989 --> 16:32.901
You apparently didn't
check his cholesterol.

16:34.076 --> 16:35.532
How far off?

16:35.620 --> 16:36.655
Twenty percent.

16:47.715 --> 16:49.671
(RINGING)

16:55.598 --> 16:57.463
Dibala didn't die
of high cholesterol.

16:57.558 --> 16:59.514
Why would anyone
even bother to compare
the two reports?

16:59.602 --> 17:01.138
The same reason I did.

17:01.229 --> 17:03.265
Because they're looking
for anything we might've
screwed up.

17:03.356 --> 17:04.937
We could claim
the blood analyzer
broke.

17:05.024 --> 17:06.104
We can't.

17:06.192 --> 17:09.150
Cameron documented that
it was perfectly calibrated
when she did the test.

17:09.237 --> 17:11.899
So the numbers are off.
It's weird, who cares?

17:11.989 --> 17:13.399
If it comes up,
just act surprised,

17:13.491 --> 17:15.356
like it's some
irrelevant curiosity.

17:15.451 --> 17:19.444
I can't do this.
I can't go in there
and stack lie upon lie.

17:20.414 --> 17:23.201
You've got to figure out
a way to explain this.

17:24.252 --> 17:25.617
Hey.
Hey.

17:25.878 --> 17:27.869
Missed you this morning.
Yeah, sorry.

17:27.964 --> 17:29.500
I needed to get in early.
I didn't want to wake you.

17:29.590 --> 17:30.875
I thought you did
want to wake me.

17:30.967 --> 17:32.707
At least that's what
you said last night.
I'm out of here.

17:32.802 --> 17:36.135
No,no.|got
the biopsy results.
It's not cancer.

17:40.351 --> 17:43.559
How can so much be wrong
with nothing being wrong?

17:43.646 --> 17:46.058
Since when is cancer
being considered nothing?

17:46.148 --> 17:49.015
I just said it's not cancer.
The cell morphologies
were all normal.

17:49.110 --> 17:50.771
And so are the most
recent CT scans.

17:50.861 --> 17:52.237
On the other hand,

17:52.321 --> 17:55.358
adenocarcinoma
of the stomach
would cause pain,

17:55.449 --> 17:59.567
consﬂpaﬂon,
and nutritional deficiencies
that could cause seizures.

17:59.662 --> 18:01.778
And wouldn't show on a CT.

18:03.499 --> 18:07.208
You were right
about the cancer,
just wrong about the place.

18:09.630 --> 18:12.212
Continue to say
nothing if you agree.

18:13.801 --> 18:16.668
Go scope him,
get another set
of biopsies.

18:22.810 --> 18:25.768
lgetcanceHng
herﬂckeL

18:25.855 --> 18:29.063
if you then showed up
with two more to
somewhere better.

18:29.150 --> 18:30.185
What are you talking about?

18:30.276 --> 18:32.107
Or showed up at all.

18:32.194 --> 18:36.153
But how does just
ruining her plans get
her to agree to yours?

18:37.742 --> 18:40.108
You talking about Thirteen?

18:40.202 --> 18:41.487
Where's she going?

18:41.579 --> 18:43.115
Nowhere this week,
thanks to you.

18:43.205 --> 18:45.992
I didn't stop her.
I'm not gonna stop her.

18:49.503 --> 18:53.212
I've already done all I could.
Now all I can do is move on.

18:56.010 --> 18:59.969
I think I actually
believe you.

19:00.514 --> 19:02.379
If you're telling the truth,

19:02.475 --> 19:04.591
you're even more
rational than I...

19:04.685 --> 19:06.221
Well, not more.

19:08.064 --> 19:10.020
Then again, more sane.

19:11.651 --> 19:14.233
You're gonna be
a good boss, boss.

19:16.614 --> 19:18.150
I told you,
there's nothing wrong.

19:18.240 --> 19:19.616
There's obviously
something wrong,

19:19.700 --> 19:21.611
and I'm not even
saying we need to talk
about it right now.

19:21.702 --> 19:24.159
I just don't see
why you have to deny it.

19:24.246 --> 19:25.656
I'm not.

19:25.748 --> 19:27.989
Now you're denying
you're denying.

19:28.084 --> 19:30.416
No. I'm denying
that there's anything
to deny.

19:30.503 --> 19:33.085
Robert, you can't do this.
You can't hide things from me.

19:37.218 --> 19:40.176
There's a problem
with the Dibala M&M.

19:40.846 --> 19:45.340
The HDL numbers on one
of his early blood panels
don't match a later panel.

19:45.434 --> 19:46.765
That's weird.

19:47.478 --> 19:48.684
Yeah.

19:53.192 --> 19:54.932
It's no big deal.

19:55.820 --> 19:58.027
Cholesterol didn't
have anything to do
with his death,

19:58.114 --> 20:00.526
but after being
let go from Mercy,

20:00.616 --> 20:02.982
and then that thing
with Thirteen's drug trial,

20:03.077 --> 20:05.659
Foreman's paranoid about
people questioning the way
he handled the case.

20:05.746 --> 20:08.078
Well, that's ridiculous.
If anything, Foreman should
be feeling secure.

20:08.165 --> 20:10.622
He's the one who
had the right diagnosis,
we talked him out of it.

20:10.710 --> 20:13.497
I know.
Don't tell him
I told you.

20:14.171 --> 20:15.752
He doesn't want
to show any signs
of weakness,

20:15.840 --> 20:19.708
especially now that
House is claiming he wants
him to stay in charge.

20:19.802 --> 20:20.962
All right.

20:21.053 --> 20:24.136
So it's still cancer.
It's just somewhere else.

20:24.223 --> 20:25.258
That's what
we're looking for,

20:25.349 --> 20:27.431
but it would explain
all the symptoms

20:27.518 --> 20:29.725
and all the normal tests
and imaging studies.

20:29.812 --> 20:32.394
CHASE: Got biopsies
of the mucosa
and the submucosa.

20:32.481 --> 20:34.472
I'm moving
towards the pylorus.

20:34.567 --> 20:35.647
It's my fault.

20:37.319 --> 20:41.312
Adenocarcinomas aren't
caused by diet or
environmental factors.

20:43.033 --> 20:47.447
I inherited a $10 million
pipeline business
when I was 24.

20:48.205 --> 20:51.447
By the time I was 30,
it was worth over a billion.

20:52.293 --> 20:55.205
Since then,
I have been involved
in over 50 deals

20:55.296 --> 20:58.333
that make that first one
look like a loser.

20:59.008 --> 21:03.342
Everything I do,
everything I touch,
turns to gold,

21:09.018 --> 21:10.599
except my family.

21:11.687 --> 21:16.351
First, my wife
and now my son.

21:21.530 --> 21:23.191
This is my fault.

21:24.492 --> 21:25.902
It's karma.

21:27.244 --> 21:29.360
That's obviously not true.

21:31.040 --> 21:32.951
(MONITORS BEEPING)

21:33.042 --> 21:34.122
He's seizing again.

21:34.210 --> 21:35.450
Get the scope out.

21:35.544 --> 21:37.455
We need five
milligrams diazepam.

21:37.546 --> 21:38.922
How's the ICP?

21:39.006 --> 21:40.507
It's eight.

21:40.591 --> 21:42.377
But the shunt's
open and clear.

21:42.468 --> 21:44.424
This isn't
intracranial pressure.

21:44.512 --> 21:46.548
Then what the hell is it?

21:54.563 --> 21:57.350
CHASE: Seizure's stopped,
but he hasn't regained
consciousness.

21:57.441 --> 22:00.729
No sign of any masses
in his stomach
or esophageal lining.

22:00.861 --> 22:03.978
And he's still
accumulating subdural
and peritoneal fluid.

22:04.073 --> 22:07.941
And every time we look
to see where it's coming from,
he starts seizing.

22:08.035 --> 22:09.821
You think
we're setting this off?

22:09.912 --> 22:10.992
I think something is.

22:11.080 --> 22:14.789
One of his stomach
biopsies shows an
arteriole partially occluded.

22:14.875 --> 22:16.536
CAMERON:
But with no abnormality
in the other layers,

22:16.627 --> 22:19.164
and no evidence
of a cellular
inflammatory reaction.

22:19.255 --> 22:20.370
It's definitely not cancer.

22:20.464 --> 22:22.329
Then it has to be
some sort of infection.

22:22.424 --> 22:24.005
We already ruled
out infection.

22:24.093 --> 22:26.709
Only because
he was treated for it
and got worse.

22:26.804 --> 22:27.884
Seems like a sound reason.

22:27.972 --> 22:30.338
Unless it's a
drug-resistant strain.

22:30.432 --> 22:32.718
Drug-resistant strain
of what?

22:32.810 --> 22:35.176
Bacterial cultures,
viral serologies,

22:35.271 --> 22:36.556
ANA and ANCA
were all negative.

22:36.647 --> 22:39.013
Everything's negative.
We obviously missed something.

22:39.108 --> 22:42.100
Maybe the seizures
aren't a new symptom,
they're an old one.

22:42.194 --> 22:43.855
No doctor noticed
a thrashing kid?

22:43.946 --> 22:45.561
Abdominal epilepsy.

22:45.656 --> 22:49.023
The seizures would just look
like pain until it spread
to his motor cortex.

22:49.118 --> 22:50.358
Wouldn't explain
the fevers.

22:50.452 --> 22:52.408
Protein malnutrition
can cause fevers.

22:52.496 --> 22:55.704
And nothing causes
malnutrition like excruciating
stomach pain

22:55.791 --> 22:58.282
that gets worse
every time you eat.

23:00.462 --> 23:04.751
I'd be a lot more certain
if it was my idea,
but it's the best we got.

23:05.134 --> 23:06.499
Start him on gabapentin,

23:06.594 --> 23:10.382
hook him up to an
intracranial EEG for
continuous monitoring.

23:21.191 --> 23:22.397
I gave him statins.

23:22.484 --> 23:23.564
What?

23:23.652 --> 23:26.064
If they ask about
the cholesterol, just say
I prescribed a statin

23:26.155 --> 23:27.235
and forgot to put it
in the chart.

23:27.323 --> 23:28.779
You want to solve
a problem in the records

23:28.866 --> 23:31.073
by creating another
problem in the records?

23:31.160 --> 23:32.195
There's no problem
with the records,

23:32.286 --> 23:33.992
there's a problem
with my recordkeeping.

23:34.079 --> 23:35.910
There's no way anyone
can prove me wrong.

23:35.998 --> 23:38.455
How did you get
access to the statins?

23:38.542 --> 23:40.578
You gonna get someone
in the pharmacy to confess

23:40.669 --> 23:43.081
to yet another
recordkeeping problem?

23:43.172 --> 23:45.754
I saw an open cart.
I just took it.

23:45.841 --> 23:48.423
Why would you steal a drug
you can just as
easily ask for?

23:48.510 --> 23:51.502
'Cause I'm trying
to get you off the hook.

23:52.181 --> 23:54.172
A story that raises
more questions
than it answers

23:54.266 --> 23:57.099
only puts the hook
deeper down my throat.

23:57.186 --> 23:58.847
It's all right.
I'll handle it.

23:59.313 --> 24:00.348
How?

24:00.522 --> 24:02.433
By telling the truth.

24:02.524 --> 24:04.105
The truth is,
I don't have the time,

24:04.193 --> 24:06.149
I'm not in the mood,
and I don't see the point.

24:06.236 --> 24:08.693
You don't want to do
the M&M because
you're not in the mood?

24:08.781 --> 24:09.770
This kid is dying,

24:09.865 --> 24:12.447
and I've got House
trying to push all his
responsibilities onto me.

24:12.534 --> 24:15.116
They're not
his responsibilities,
they're yours.

24:15.204 --> 24:16.444
You're the one who
wanted to be in charge.

24:16.538 --> 24:18.950
I wanted to
be in charge,
not a figurehead.

24:19.041 --> 24:20.997
Then do the M&M,
it's all yours.

24:21.085 --> 24:22.950
You want me to get
flogged? For what?

24:23.045 --> 24:24.501
So you can have
an academic debate

24:24.588 --> 24:28.251
about a diagnostic
dilemma no one's
ever gonna face again?

24:30.177 --> 24:31.792
What the hell's
going on here?

24:31.887 --> 24:34.173
I just don't want
to do the M&M.

24:38.560 --> 24:39.549
Did it work?

24:39.645 --> 24:40.805
Not even close.

24:56.745 --> 24:58.076
Everything okay?

24:58.163 --> 25:01.496
Just waiting for whatever
is about to go wrong.

25:01.583 --> 25:02.743
Thirteen called.

25:02.835 --> 25:05.827
She have a theory that
makes more sense than
abdominal epilepsy?

25:05.921 --> 25:08.412
She said someone hacked
into her e-mail account

25:08.507 --> 25:11.169
and canceled her
airline reservation.

25:11.260 --> 25:12.545
I'm guessing Foreman.

25:12.636 --> 25:13.671
Really?

25:14.096 --> 25:17.259
You're accusing Foreman,
not me. Cool.

25:19.518 --> 25:22.055
You really want
Foreman to stay in
charge of the team?

25:22.146 --> 25:23.727
Makes sense.

25:23.814 --> 25:26.476
He loves power,
I love puzzles.

25:27.484 --> 25:29.600
You love power
and puzzles.

25:30.279 --> 25:31.394
True.

25:32.781 --> 25:34.863
And when I had them both...

25:40.122 --> 25:41.783
It wasn't Foreman.

25:42.291 --> 25:43.872
How do you know?

25:44.460 --> 25:46.291
He said he's moved on.

25:46.879 --> 25:48.244
And you believe him?

25:48.338 --> 25:50.374
I believe that
he believes him.

25:50.466 --> 25:52.798
(PAGER BEEPING)

25:56.847 --> 26:00.135
Looks like it's time
for me to get off
the bench.

26:06.815 --> 26:08.225
What's up?

26:08.942 --> 26:10.603
Are you Dr. House?

26:10.694 --> 26:12.400
I understand
you're a big fan.

26:12.488 --> 26:14.649
I'll have my guy send
over a signed glossy.

26:14.740 --> 26:18.733
Continuous EEG shows
no interictal spikes.
It's not abdominal epilepsy.

26:18.827 --> 26:20.408
You paged me
to tell me
what it's not?

26:20.496 --> 26:23.158
l paged you
to show you this.

26:26.835 --> 26:28.826
That, I did not expect.

26:28.921 --> 26:31.253
What the hell is that
supposed to mean?

26:31.340 --> 26:33.956
Darn it. I knew
I should've stayed outside.

26:34.051 --> 26:35.791
The fantasy is
always much better
than the reality.

26:35.886 --> 26:37.877
You think this is a joke?
That's my son.

26:37.971 --> 26:42.465
He's dying, and not one
of you seem to have
the slightest clue why.

26:42.559 --> 26:45.722
I know. That's why
it's so interesting.

26:49.817 --> 26:52.354
Feven
stomach pain,
seizures,

26:52.444 --> 26:56.278
peritoneal and
subdural fluid collection
and now spots.

26:56.365 --> 26:58.401
Could be
an allergic reaction
to one of his meds.

26:58.492 --> 27:01.279
That suddenly developed
eight hours after
he started the meds?

27:01.370 --> 27:03.656
If it's not cancer
or infection, it has
to be autoimmune.

27:03.747 --> 27:06.204
Systemic lupus
complicated by
a CNS vasculitis

27:06.291 --> 27:08.953
would explain the rash,
fever, ascites...

27:09.044 --> 27:11.877
CNS vasculitis would cause
a stiff neck along
with the headache.

27:11.964 --> 27:14.751
And would've showed up
on the dural biopsy.

27:15.425 --> 27:18.917
What about
polyarteritis nodosa?
It can occur in kids.

27:19.012 --> 27:21.719
Except you can't
have arteritis
without inflammation.

27:21.807 --> 27:24.549
Okay, you come up
with something better.

27:27.020 --> 27:28.100
Go on.

27:28.188 --> 27:30.053
There was some inflammation
in the skin biopsy.

27:30.149 --> 27:33.061
Plus he's got elevated
diastolic pressure.

27:33.152 --> 27:34.608
It's barely elevated,

27:34.695 --> 27:37.107
which you'd expect given
the number of procedures
he's undergone.

27:37.239 --> 27:39.901
Well, barely is more
than not barely.

27:40.951 --> 27:42.361
(SIGHING)

27:43.537 --> 27:45.198
Not my decision.

27:46.373 --> 27:48.659
But if it was, I'd say
start him on prednisone

27:48.750 --> 27:50.741
and get a testicular biopsy.

27:51.086 --> 27:53.452
If he's gonna have
any real inflammation,
it'll be down there.

27:53.547 --> 27:54.627
Cameron and I will do it.

27:54.715 --> 27:56.797
Why? It was Chase's idea.

27:56.884 --> 27:59.546
Kid's father is not
gonna be happy about
a fourth set of biopsies,

27:59.636 --> 28:02.093
and you've got
a better rapport.

28:02.181 --> 28:04.467
What's really
going on here?

28:04.892 --> 28:07.133
You need Chase
to help you over-prep
for the M&M?

28:07.227 --> 28:08.342
Yes.

28:09.271 --> 28:11.603
Then say so,
don't be a child.

28:13.817 --> 28:15.523
Is it on his penis?

28:17.237 --> 28:18.443
The kid's rash?

28:18.530 --> 28:19.906
Yeah, why?

28:19.990 --> 28:23.357
Means it's most likely
affecting the small
blood vessels.

28:23.452 --> 28:27.161
That's why we didn't
see any inflammation
on the biopsies.

28:27.789 --> 28:31.657
It's not polyarteritis,
it's Degos disease.

28:38.926 --> 28:40.382
I'll do it.

28:54.608 --> 28:56.769
Your son has Degos disease.

28:57.694 --> 29:00.071
It causes micro-blood
vessels in the brain,

29:00.155 --> 29:03.943
skin, and GI tract to
break down, clot off.

29:06.161 --> 29:11.576
It sometimes manifests
early on with atrophic
papules on the penis.

29:11.667 --> 29:16.127
In your son's case,
we don't know why,
but they came much later.

29:18.298 --> 29:20.038
What's the treatment?

29:22.386 --> 29:24.001
There isn't one.

29:24.513 --> 29:26.003
It's incurable.

29:32.437 --> 29:33.938
You're wrong.

29:35.107 --> 29:38.099
You've already
been wrong
a bunch of times.

29:38.485 --> 29:41.818
We rechecked the biopsies.
It's definitely Degos.

29:46.368 --> 29:49.701
I'm sorry.
I wish there was
something we could do.

29:56.378 --> 29:57.709
How long?

29:58.964 --> 30:00.625
Not much longer.

30:02.884 --> 30:04.715
What does that mean?

30:05.804 --> 30:07.544
A day at the most.

30:35.625 --> 30:37.911
(SIGHING)

30:51.892 --> 30:53.632
All right. Great.

30:53.727 --> 30:55.342
We need to talk.

30:55.437 --> 30:57.268
Unless it's life or death,
it's gonna have to wait.

30:57.356 --> 30:59.096
It's about Dibala.

30:59.191 --> 31:01.022
Let me rephrase,
unless it's a current...

31:01.109 --> 31:03.771
Foreman can't present
the case at the M&M.

31:04.571 --> 31:08.189
I know you guys are busy,
but he's just gonna have to
suck it up and make the time.

31:08.283 --> 31:09.238
It's not the time.

31:09.326 --> 31:10.816
Then what is it?

31:11.453 --> 31:13.694
The anticentromere
antibodies test,

31:13.789 --> 31:15.654
the test that caused us
to change the treatment

31:15.749 --> 31:20.960
from blastomycosis
to scleroderma, it wasn't...

31:21.630 --> 31:23.291
It wasn't what?

31:24.299 --> 31:27.211
Dr. Cuddy,
they need you in
the Pediatric ICU.

31:27.302 --> 31:28.803
Who's they?
I don't know,

31:28.929 --> 31:31.136
but I think
they're lawyers.

31:33.141 --> 31:36.679
If you guys screwed
something up,
just come clean.

31:37.771 --> 31:39.932
It's not gonna be that bad.

31:42.734 --> 31:45.271
With all due respect,
you don't know
what's at stake here.

31:45.362 --> 31:47.193
What's going on?
You need to stop him.

31:47.280 --> 31:48.360
He's about to
ruin his life.

31:48.448 --> 31:49.858
Like you give a damn
about my life.

31:49.950 --> 31:51.110
Roy, he's right.

31:51.201 --> 31:54.238
You're borrowing money
to buy options that are
already out of the money.

31:54.329 --> 31:56.160
Even you won't be able
to cover the losses.

31:56.248 --> 31:59.615
Your house, cars,
bank accounts,
you'll lose everything.

31:59.709 --> 32:01.370
HOUSE: That's the point.

32:03.004 --> 32:06.917
The billionaire thinks that
the gods will treat him
better if he's broke.

32:07.008 --> 32:08.259
I suggested
he give it to me...

32:08.343 --> 32:10.629
There has got to be
some sort of balance.

32:10.720 --> 32:13.883
You can't have all the
good fortune in just
one area of your life.

32:13.974 --> 32:16.841
That's not how
the world's supposed
to work.

32:16.935 --> 32:18.391
Who said the world
was supposed to work?

everything out.

give it to a charity...
I can't get anything back.

He's insane.
He's irrational,

32:25.986 --> 32:29.103
so are most people.
Unfortunately, it doesn't
make them insane.

of people who rely on this

32:41.209 --> 32:45.623
I know you're upset,
but you shouldn't make a
decision like this right now.

Give it some time.

32:48.633 --> 32:50.419
My son doesn't
have any time.

32:50.510 --> 32:53.877
Your son's dying from
an incurable disease,
not bad karma.

32:53.972 --> 32:56.884
No. He's not dying.

32:58.059 --> 33:00.015
It's not gonna happen.
I'm not gonna let it.

what you're talking about.

Cuddy had IT trace all the IP
addresses who've logged
into my e-mail account.

34:17.430 --> 34:20.763
There were two.
Mine and yours.

34:22.519 --> 34:24.851
Obviously House
decided he needs you
more than he's willing to...

34:24.938 --> 34:26.474
I already asked House.

34:27.482 --> 34:28.767
And he'd certainly
neverHe.

34:28.858 --> 34:32.271
No, he'd lie.
Except he wants me gone.

34:32.362 --> 34:36.230
And he'd do a lot
betterjob of lying
than you just did.

34:36.324 --> 34:38.781
Really? It was that bad?

34:38.868 --> 34:40.529
No, actually.

34:41.162 --> 34:47.624
But it doesn't matter
any more. Why? Because
of House or Foreman?

34:49.004 --> 34:52.622
You're good for both of them,
but Foreman's
not my best friend.

34:52.716 --> 34:54.502
House will be fine.

34:54.801 --> 34:56.132
Maybe.

34:56.219 --> 34:58.505
But with you
on the team,
he'd be better.

34:58.597 --> 35:03.261
He needs someone
who doesn't need him.

35:03.351 --> 35:07.890
You're the only one he's
never really been able to suck
into his crazy House vortex.

35:07.981 --> 35:10.814

Why didn't you
just come to me?

if House asked. And I knew
he would, eventually.

at least trying

35:34.716 --> 35:37.173
to have real relationships
with people.

36:32.649 --> 36:36.267
because of what I saw
a grief-stricken dad do
on his son's deathbed.

36:36.361 --> 36:37.646
No, you didn't.

36:37.737 --> 36:38.772
Yes, I did.

36:39.948 --> 36:41.563
You are a jerk.

36:42.492 --> 36:44.528
She's making a mistake.

36:44.619 --> 36:45.904
So you did it for her?

36:45.995 --> 36:47.496
She's a good doctor.

36:47.580 --> 36:49.445
So you did it for you?

36:49.541 --> 36:51.497
I'm not the one
in charge any more.

36:51.584 --> 36:53.575
So you did it for Foreman?

36:53.670 --> 36:57.379
She's a smoking-hot,
newly-single bisexual.

36:57.465 --> 37:00.207
Why don't you just
admit that you like
having her around?

37:00.301 --> 37:01.916
She's good for you.
You need her.

37:02.011 --> 37:05.629
Because I was born
with a heart three
sizes too small.

37:06.224 --> 37:08.385
No, you weren't.
Yes, I...

37:10.812 --> 37:11.801
What?

37:27.370 --> 37:28.780
He still alive?

37:28.872 --> 37:30.032
Yeah.

37:30.248 --> 37:34.036
Good. Start him on heparin
and IV immunoglobulin.

37:34.127 --> 37:35.708
For Degos?
The cardiac arrest

37:35.795 --> 37:38.457
wasn't just an "everything
goes to hell in a
hand basket" arrest.

37:38.548 --> 37:41.039
It was a coronary event.
Coronaries are large vessels.

37:41.134 --> 37:42.749
Means it can't be Degos.

37:42.844 --> 37:43.924
But the biopsies
confirmed...

37:44.012 --> 37:45.718
Obstructed
blood vessels.

37:45.805 --> 37:48.296
They can't be obstructed
because of Degos.

37:48.391 --> 37:51.349
Means it's primary
antiphospholipid syndrome.

37:53.354 --> 37:55.219
Are you sure?
Nope.

37:56.107 --> 38:00.020
But I will be if he
responds to the heparin
and immunoglobulin.

38:05.366 --> 38:06.947
By the way,

38:09.204 --> 38:12.696
and she ran to me,
Cuddy, and Wilson,
everyone but you.

38:14.751 --> 38:16.537
She's not over you.

38:17.253 --> 38:18.629
Or she is.

38:48.117 --> 38:49.573
Where did you find it?

38:49.661 --> 38:50.741
Find what?

38:55.333 --> 38:58.496
It was right on top
of the file. You
don't know about it?

38:58.586 --> 39:00.577
No, been here all night.

39:01.506 --> 39:04.498
One of Dibala's previous
docs was prescribing
ultra-high doses

39:04.592 --> 39:07.254
of niacin-bound
chromium to boost his HDL.

39:07.345 --> 39:08.505
So?

39:08.596 --> 39:10.587
So, it gives us
something to point to.

39:10.682 --> 39:13.469
We can explain
the wide variation
between the HDL numbers.

39:13.560 --> 39:16.222
We're safe. We're covered.

39:18.273 --> 39:20.264
You really didn't
request the info?

39:21.109 --> 39:22.690
No.

39:22.777 --> 39:25.109
And obviously
you didn't either,

39:26.614 --> 39:28.150
which means...

40:03.192 --> 40:04.648
It worked.

40:05.236 --> 40:06.976
The medicine worked.

40:08.197 --> 40:09.573
It worked.

40:15.079 --> 40:16.990
(BOTH LAUGHING)

40:25.006 --> 40:26.837
How did you find it?

40:29.594 --> 40:31.334
Fat, old, black guy.

40:32.055 --> 40:35.547
I knew he had to be
taking something
for his cholesterol.

40:35.642 --> 40:37.132
And what now?

40:38.019 --> 40:39.850
I'm not the boss.

40:39.938 --> 40:41.678
You don't think
I should be fired?

40:41.773 --> 40:42.933
VVhy?

40:43.024 --> 40:46.687
I doubt we'll ever
be treating a genocidal
dictator again.

40:47.320 --> 40:49.857
Better a murder
than a misdiagnosis.

40:54.243 --> 40:56.985
Whether you want to be
in charge or not,

40:57.747 --> 40:59.112
you are.

41:00.124 --> 41:02.035
And you always will be.

41:12.136 --> 41:13.922
(RINGING)

41:19.978 --> 41:22.811
FOREMAN:
75-year-old African man
presented to our hospital

41:22.897 --> 41:25.684
following a rapid
onset of hemoptysis.

41:25.775 --> 41:27.857
He had been fine
prior to onset.

41:27.944 --> 41:31.152
No chest pain, fever,
coughing or chills.

41:31.906 --> 41:34.864
He does note a
nine-hour plane flight...

41:34.993 --> 41:37.780
