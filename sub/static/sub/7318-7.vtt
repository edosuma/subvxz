WEBVTT

00:13.000 --> 00:15.100
PREVIOUSLY ON
"GREY'S ANATOMY"...

00:15.133 --> 00:16.700
I'M TOUCHIN' THE AORTA.

00:16.733 --> 00:18.667
(Preston) O'MALLEY?
YES, SIR?

00:18.700 --> 00:20.467
YOU JUST FLEW SOLO.

00:20.500 --> 00:22.400
(Alex) O'MALLEY PLUGS A HOLE
WITH HIS FINGER,

00:22.433 --> 00:23.700
AND EVERYONE WALKS AROUND LIKE
HE'S SOME KIND OF HERO.

00:23.733 --> 00:26.333
I HAVE ONE OFF DAY.
YOU CHICKENED OUT.

00:26.367 --> 00:27.467
I HESITATED BRIEFLY.

00:27.500 --> 00:31.267
WHY DIDN'T YOU KISS IZZIE?

00:31.300 --> 00:32.233
CRISTINA.

00:32.267 --> 00:33.433
IT'S MY FIRST DAY BACK.

00:33.467 --> 00:35.833
I'M NOT WAITING FOREVER.

00:35.867 --> 00:37.233
OKAY, WE'RE A COUPLE.

00:37.267 --> 00:39.333
WHATEVER. DON'T MAKE
A BIG DEAL ABOUT IT.

00:39.367 --> 00:42.133
SO PICK ME.
CHOOSE ME. LOVE ME.

00:42.167 --> 00:44.533
DEREK,
HAVE YOU EVER THOUGHT

00:44.567 --> 00:47.367
THAT EVEN IF I AM SATAN
AND AN ADULTERESS BITCH

00:47.400 --> 00:48.567
THAT I STILL MIGHT BE
THE LOVE OF YOUR LIFE?

00:48.600 --> 00:51.667
YOU'RE STAYING WITH HER.
YEAH, SHE'S MY WIFE.

00:55.167 --> 00:58.033
***

00:58.067 --> 01:00.067
(Meredith) COMMUNICATION--

01:00.067 --> 01:03.067
IT'S THE FIRST THING
WE REALLY LEARN IN LIFE...

01:08.567 --> 01:10.467
SHE DIDN'T EVEN KNOW
HE WAS MARRIED.

01:10.500 --> 01:12.433
I MEAN, HIS WIFE JUST SHOWS UP
AND HE DUMPS HER.

01:12.467 --> 01:14.433
I HEARD SHE FLIPPED OUT.

01:14.467 --> 01:16.367
WHAT DOES SHE EXPECT?

01:16.400 --> 01:18.300
SHE GOT WHAT SHE DESERVED,
DATING AN ATTENDING.

01:18.333 --> 01:20.233
DATING McDREAMY.
HAVE YOU SEEN HIS HAIR?

01:20.267 --> 01:22.167
NO GUY'S THAT PERFECT.

01:22.200 --> 01:24.133
I THINK IT'S KIND OF SAD.
SHE HAS TO WORK HERE--

01:24.167 --> 01:27.800
WITH HIM, WITH THEM--
EVERYONE KNOWS.

01:27.833 --> 01:29.800
FUNNY THING IS,
ONCE WE GROW UP,

01:29.833 --> 01:32.633
LEARN OUR WORDS
AND REALLY START TALKING,

01:32.667 --> 01:35.067
THE HARDER IT BECOMES
TO KNOW WHAT TO SAY

01:35.100 --> 01:38.633
OR HOW TO ASK
FOR WHAT WE REALLY NEED.

01:38.667 --> 01:42.100
WHAT DO YOU NEED TO,
UM, MAKE THIS MARRIAGE WORK?

01:42.133 --> 01:44.067
I NEED HER
TO MOVE TO SEATTLE.
THAT'S JUST--

01:44.067 --> 01:45.800
ADDISON...
WHAT DO YOU NEED?

01:45.833 --> 01:48.433
I NEED HIM TO STOP TALKING
TO MEREDITH.

01:48.467 --> 01:50.367
BUT I WORK WITH HER.

01:50.400 --> 01:52.300
YOU WANT ME TO PICK UP
MY ENTIRE PRACTICE

01:52.333 --> 01:53.667
AND MOVE HERE, FINE.

01:53.700 --> 01:55.600
I WANT YOU TO GIVE UP
YOUR GIRLFRIEND.

01:55.633 --> 01:57.600
I DID GIVE UP
MY GIRLFRIEND. OKAY?

01:57.633 --> 01:59.500
YOU WANTED ME TO TAKE YOU BACK,
I TOOK YOU BACK HERE IN SEATTLE.

01:59.533 --> 02:02.367
SEE? ONCE AGAIN, IT'S ALL
ABOUT WHAT HE WANTS.
SHE'S NOT LISTENING TO ME.
I'M NOT GONNA MOVE

02:02.400 --> 02:05.200
BACK TO MANHATTAN.
I AM NOT THE SAME PERSON.
I KNOW.
YOU'RE A FLANNEL WEARING,

02:05.233 --> 02:07.333
WOOD CHOPPING FISHERMAN.
I GET IT.
I'M NOT GONNA
TALK TO HER ANYMORE

02:07.367 --> 02:09.367
IF SHE'S GONNA BEHAVE
LIKE THIS.
FINE.

02:09.400 --> 02:12.367
SORRY, GUYS. TIME'S UP.
GOOD PROGRESS.

02:12.400 --> 02:14.833
***

02:14.867 --> 02:16.767
WELL, WE HAVE TO DO SOMETHING.
(yawns)

02:16.800 --> 02:18.700
MEREDITH'S BECOME, LIKE,
AN EXHIBIT LIKE THE--HEY--

02:18.733 --> 02:20.433
LIKE A ZOO ANIMAL,

02:20.467 --> 02:23.433
LIKE THAT RARE PANDA
THAT EVERYONE STARES AT.

02:23.467 --> 02:25.367
PLEASE DON'T SAY THAT
TO HER FACE.

02:25.400 --> 02:26.433
I THINK THAT PANDA
DIED ALONE.

02:26.467 --> 02:27.233
(chuckles)

02:27.267 --> 02:29.333
THIS COULD JUST AS EASILY
BE YOU

02:29.367 --> 02:31.267
IF PEOPLE
KNEW ABOUT YOU AND...

02:31.300 --> 02:32.800
YOU TAKE THAT BACK.

02:32.833 --> 02:34.300
NO. I'M JUST SAYIN'

02:34.333 --> 02:36.233
WE SHOULD DO SOMETHIN'
TO CHEER HER UP.

02:36.267 --> 02:38.167
DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.
IT'S UNDER CONTROL.

02:38.200 --> 02:40.100
WHAT--WHAT DO YOU GUYS
HAVE GOIN' ON?

02:40.133 --> 02:41.067
NOTHING.
NOTHING.

02:41.100 --> 02:42.833
WHAT?
WHERE'S KAREV?

02:42.867 --> 02:47.067
PROBABLY OFF SOMEWHERE
NOT KISSING SOMEBODY.

02:47.100 --> 02:48.833
AHEM. HEY, SO,
UM, AFTER ROUNDS,

02:48.867 --> 02:51.733
WE HAVE SOMETHING
TO SHOW YOU.

02:51.767 --> 02:54.267
MERE? MEREDITH,
CAN YOU HEAR US?

02:54.300 --> 02:56.200
SHE'S NOT DEAF.
WELL, SHE LOOKS WEIRD.

02:56.233 --> 02:57.400
WHAT DO YOU EXPECT?

02:57.433 --> 02:59.333
DEREK DIDN'T PICK HER.
SHE'S GONE MENTAL.

02:59.367 --> 03:01.267
MEREDITH,
HAVE YOU GONE MENTAL?

03:01.300 --> 03:02.800
I HAVE NOT GONE MENTAL.

03:02.833 --> 03:05.167
SEE? OKAY, SHE'S FINE.
WE HAVE SOMETHING TO SHOW YOU.

03:05.200 --> 03:07.100
SO WHATEVER YOU DO,
DO NOT GET ASSIGNED

03:07.133 --> 03:08.800
TO A SURGERY THIS MORNING.
IT'S REALLY GOOD.

03:08.833 --> 03:10.767
GIVE IT A CHANCE, DEREK.

03:10.800 --> 03:12.567
I GAVE IT A CHANCE.
HE'S A MORON.

03:12.600 --> 03:15.733
***

03:15.767 --> 03:16.733
YEAH, MIND YOUR OWN BUSINESS.

03:16.767 --> 03:19.067
(Man) I WOULDN'T WANNA
BE HER. HUH.

03:19.067 --> 03:20.133
MRS. KIMBERLY GRISWOLD.

03:20.167 --> 03:22.833
A HISTORY OF HEART DISEASE
AND MULTIPLE SURGERIES.

03:22.867 --> 03:25.267
IN FOR A BEATING HEART
QUADRUPLE C.A.B.G.

03:27.133 --> 03:29.600
YOU'RE LATE.
YES, KAREV,

03:29.633 --> 03:30.733
NICE OF YOU TO JOIN US.

03:30.767 --> 03:33.067
WHY KEEP THE HEART BEATING,
DOCTOR YANG?

03:33.067 --> 03:37.400
I DON'T KNOW.

03:37.433 --> 03:39.267
WHAT?
WHAT?

03:41.200 --> 03:44.233
I HAVE NO IDEA.

03:44.267 --> 03:47.133
OH, I DON'T KNOW, EITHER.
I JUST DON'T.

03:47.167 --> 03:50.700
BECAUSE OF...OW. WHAT?

03:50.733 --> 03:53.500
ANYONE ELSE?
STRESS REDUCTION BECAUSE
OF THE PREVIOUS SURGERIES--

03:53.533 --> 03:55.667
O'MALLEY.
I KNOW--I KNOW THE ANSWER.

03:55.700 --> 03:56.833
I'M ASKING O'MALLEY.

03:56.867 --> 03:59.600
SCAR TISSUE'S TOO DEEP.

03:59.633 --> 04:01.333
THE HEART'S TOO WEAK
TO START UP AGAIN,

04:01.367 --> 04:03.700
SO YOU ONLY IMMOBILIZE
THE PORTION YOU'RE WORKING ON

04:03.733 --> 04:07.400
AND YOU LEAVE THE REST
OF THE HEART ON ITS OWN.

04:09.300 --> 04:11.300
WELCOME TO THE CASE.

04:11.333 --> 04:13.100
THANK YOU.

04:21.400 --> 04:23.100
WHAT IS THAT?

04:23.133 --> 04:24.600
P.J.'s.

04:24.633 --> 04:26.300
THAT ISN'T FAIR,
AND YOU KNOW IT.

04:26.333 --> 04:28.233
HE'S PUNISHING ME
FOR THE ELEVATOR.

04:28.267 --> 04:30.400
HE'S PUNISHING YOU BECAUSE YOU
WERE LATE FOR ROUNDS.

04:30.433 --> 04:34.100
YOU WANNA TELL ME
WHY YOU WERE LATE?

04:34.133 --> 04:37.200
DR. SHEPHERD NEEDS SOMEBODY
ON HIS NERVE CASE TODAY. GO.

04:37.233 --> 04:41.567
AND YOU THREE--
BRUSH UP ON HOW

04:41.600 --> 04:43.500
NOT TO EMBARRASS ME
IN FRONT OF THE ATTENDINGS

04:43.533 --> 04:45.833
OR I'LL SEE TO IT THAT YOUR
HEARTS STOP BEATING. YOU CLEAR?

04:45.867 --> 04:49.700
SORRY, DR. BAILEY.
WE REALLY APOLOGIZE.

04:49.733 --> 04:52.267
(Meredith)
WHAT IS GOING ON?

04:52.300 --> 04:54.200
WE FOUND A CASE.

04:54.233 --> 04:56.133
YOU STOLE A CASE.
BORROWED FROM PSYCH.

04:56.167 --> 04:58.400
OKAY, THE PRELIMS--OKAY, THIS
THING IS TOTALLY UNPRECEDENTED.

04:58.433 --> 05:00.333
AND WE FOUND IT.
STOLE IT.

05:00.367 --> 05:02.267
OKAY, FOUND, STOLE,
HIJACKED, WHATEVER.

05:02.300 --> 05:04.200
OKAY, MEREDITH,
BEHIND THIS DOOR

05:04.233 --> 05:07.200
IS THE COOLEST MEDICAL MYSTERY
I HAVE EVER SEEN.

05:07.233 --> 05:10.100
NOW YOU CAN EITHER WALK AWAY,
YOU KNOW, GUILT FREE...

05:10.133 --> 05:13.400
UH-HUH.
OR WALK THROUGH THIS DOOR,

05:13.433 --> 05:15.433
RISK YOUR PLACE IN THE PROGRAM,
WHICH COULD

05:15.467 --> 05:17.367
POSSIBLY LEAD TO SPENDING
THE REST OF YOUR LIFE

05:17.400 --> 05:20.267
SERVING FRIES
IN BAD CLOTHING.

05:20.300 --> 05:23.100
SO ARE YOU IN?

05:23.133 --> 05:24.700
HELL, YEAH.

05:24.733 --> 05:27.333
MR. HERMAN.

05:27.367 --> 05:28.767
OH, NO.
PLEASE CALL ME SHANE.

05:28.800 --> 05:31.600
I GOTTA HIT THE CAN--AGAIN.

05:31.633 --> 05:34.500
SEEMS LIKE I GOTTA GO
EVERY 30 SECONDS THESE DAYS.

05:34.533 --> 05:36.467
JUST A GUY.
WAIT FOR IT.

05:36.500 --> 05:38.367
I SURE AM GLAD TO BE OFF
THAT PSYCH FLOOR.

05:38.400 --> 05:39.700
WHAT'S SO SPECIAL?

05:39.733 --> 05:41.633
WAIT FOR IT.

05:41.667 --> 05:44.367
OOH. AH.

05:45.567 --> 05:47.467
I'M NOT NUTS.

05:47.500 --> 05:52.167
I'M JUST PREGNANT. OH.

05:58.100 --> 06:00.800
***

06:00.833 --> 06:05.400
(Woman) * NOBODY KNOWS
WHERE THEY MIGHT END UP *

06:05.433 --> 06:07.767
* NOBODY KNOWS

06:19.133 --> 06:20.800
* OH, OH

06:20.833 --> 06:25.067
* SUPPOSE YOU'LL NEVER KNOW

06:27.267 --> 06:28.700
I WAS FINE,
AND THEN LAST MONTH,

06:28.733 --> 06:33.267
UNH. HUGE BELLY.
MY DOCTOR JUST KEPT

06:33.300 --> 06:36.467
TELLIN' ME I WAS GAININ' WEIGHT
WITH MY WIFE.

06:36.500 --> 06:38.167
SHE'S DUE ON THE 30th.
IT'S OUR FIRST.

06:38.200 --> 06:40.767
CONGRATULATIONS.
THE ADMITTING INTERN
SHIPPED HIM OFF TO PSYCH.

06:40.800 --> 06:42.700
BARELY DID A PHYSICAL.
HEAR THAT?

06:42.733 --> 06:44.733
IT'S NOT FLUID.
THERE'S SOMETHIN' IN THERE.

06:44.767 --> 06:46.667
OH, YEAH, NO JOKE.
THERE'S SOMETHIN' IN THERE.

06:46.700 --> 06:48.600
I'VE BEEN ABLE TO FEEL IT
GETTIN' BIGGER AND BIGGER

06:48.633 --> 06:54.067
GROWIN' IN MY...
YOU KNOW... MY WOMB.

06:55.067 --> 06:56.833
YEAH, I KNOW I SOUND CRAZY.

06:56.867 --> 07:01.167
I DO. BUT I CAN PROVE IT.

07:01.200 --> 07:03.567
THIS ROOM IS SUPPOSED
TO BE UNOCCUPIED.

07:03.600 --> 07:05.300
WHOSE PATIENT IS THIS?

07:05.333 --> 07:06.633
HERS.
HERS.

07:06.667 --> 07:08.733
WHO TRANSFERRED HIM?
I DON'T HAVE ANY PAPERWORK.

07:08.767 --> 07:10.700
ANY TRANSFER DOCUMENTS.
GIMME A BREAK.

07:10.733 --> 07:12.233
WE SHUFFLE ROOMS
ALL THE TIME.

07:12.267 --> 07:14.100
YOU KNOW, IF WE NEED
A BED PAN CHANGED,

07:14.133 --> 07:17.167
UM, WE'LL LET YOU KNOW.
OKAY, DOCTOR, YOU DO THAT.

07:17.200 --> 07:18.800
OKAY, WHERE'S HIS CHART?

07:21.200 --> 07:23.200
DON'T TELL ME YOU DON'T HAVE
HIS CHART. YOU STEAL A PATIENT--

07:23.233 --> 07:25.067
THAT WAS YOUR JOB.
YEAH, I WAS ON LOOKOUT.

07:25.100 --> 07:26.567
AHEM.

07:35.200 --> 07:37.100
HOW YOU DOIN'?

07:37.133 --> 07:40.300
YOU GOOD?

07:40.333 --> 07:42.667
YOU LOOK GOOD.

07:42.700 --> 07:45.600
COME ON. WE'RE FRIENDS.

07:45.633 --> 07:47.633
WHAT'S MY NAME?

07:49.533 --> 07:53.833
UM...ALL RIGHT. SO I DON'T
KNOW YOUR NAME.

07:53.867 --> 07:57.367
IT'S NOT LIKE
WE CAN'T TALK.

07:57.400 --> 08:00.367
YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE A SURGEON
FOR ME TO TALK TO YOU, YOU KNOW.

08:00.400 --> 08:02.100
REALLY?
REALLY.

08:02.133 --> 08:06.067
BECAUSE I THOUGHT YOU ONLY
TALK TO ATTENDINGS.

08:07.833 --> 08:10.233
UH, NICOLE, YOU'VE BEEN
HAVING PROBLEMS

08:10.267 --> 08:11.700
WITH SPASTICITY?

08:11.733 --> 08:13.600
MOM?

08:13.633 --> 08:15.400
SHE SAYS THE SPASMS
MAKE HER LEGS DANCE.

08:15.433 --> 08:17.067
MM-HMM.
WE JUST WANTED TO MAKE THINGS

08:17.100 --> 08:18.467
A LITTLE EASIER FOR HER.

08:18.500 --> 08:21.267
SHE STARTS COLLEGE
THIS FALL.
SEATTLE COMMUNITY.

08:21.300 --> 08:23.200
RIGHT DOWN THE STREET
FROM US.
NOT THAT SHE WOULDN'T
HAVE HER PICK

08:23.233 --> 08:25.067
OF SCHOOLS OUT OF STATE.

08:25.067 --> 08:27.467
BUT SHE'S NOT READY
FOR THAT YET.

08:27.500 --> 08:30.067
WHAT, NOT BECAUSE
SHE'S IN A WHEELCHAIR?

08:30.100 --> 08:32.700
HAS DR. OSTFELD MENTIONED
SOMETHING CALLED A CYSTOPLASTY?

08:32.733 --> 08:34.833
NO? IT'S AN OPERATION
TO ENLARGE NICOLE'S BLADDER.

08:34.867 --> 08:37.400
IT CREATES AN OPENING
CALLED A STOMA.

08:37.433 --> 08:39.100
IT'S IMPROVED THE QUALITY
OF LIFE IN A LOT

08:39.133 --> 08:40.733
OF MY PARALYSIS PATIENTS.
WE TOYED WITH THE IDEA

08:40.767 --> 08:42.667
A FEW YEARS AGO.
IT'S NOT FOR US.

08:42.700 --> 08:44.600
WELL, MAYBE WE SHOULD
REVISIT IT.

08:44.633 --> 08:46.167
REVISIT AN INVASIVE,
RISKY PROCEDURE

08:46.200 --> 08:49.233
THAT'S GOT A 20% FAILURE RATE,
I DON'T THINK SO?

08:49.267 --> 08:51.167
NICOLE, IT'S SOMETHING
WORTH CONSIDERING.

08:51.200 --> 08:53.467
IT MEANS YOU WOULDN'T HAVE TO
WEAR THE CATHETER ALL THE TIME.

08:53.500 --> 08:55.400
NOT TO MENTION THE MEDICAL
BENEFITS. IT WOULD, UH...

08:55.433 --> 08:58.267
IMPROVE YOUR QUALITY OF LIFE.
YOU KNOW?

08:58.300 --> 09:00.200
YOU'D BE LIKE GIRLS
YOUR OWN AGE.

09:00.233 --> 09:02.367
YOU'D BE IN CONTROL OF YOUR OWN
BLADDER. NO MESSY BAGS.

09:02.400 --> 09:04.433
YOU COULD HAVE
A MORE NORMAL SEX LIFE.

09:09.733 --> 09:12.600
WELL, YOU KNOW, WHEN THAT
BECOMES AN ISSUE, OF COURSE.

09:12.633 --> 09:13.633
WE'RE HERE FOR
THE PAIN PROCEDURE. THAT'S IT.

09:13.667 --> 09:16.133
(Alex) THAT GIRL AND HER MOM
SHARE THE SAME BRAIN.

09:16.167 --> 09:18.067
SHE'S NOT GETTIN'
THAT SURGERY.

09:18.100 --> 09:19.833
I WANT YOU TO TAKE NICOLE WITH
YOU EVERYWHERE YOU GO TODAY.

09:19.867 --> 09:21.767
TAKE HER TO LABS, TAKE HER
TO COFFEE, TAKE HER ANYWHERE.

09:21.800 --> 09:23.700
JUST GET HER
AWAY FROM HER PARENTS.

09:23.733 --> 09:25.633
YOU WANT ME TO BABYSIT
THE WHEELCHAIR CHICK?

09:25.667 --> 09:27.567
NICOLE.
SHE THINKS YOU'RE CUTE.

09:27.600 --> 09:29.500
SHE'S A TEENAGER, WHICH MEANS
SHE MIGHT EVEN LISTEN TO YOU.

09:29.533 --> 09:32.200
YOU WANT ME TO CONVINCE HER
TO GET THAT SURGERY.

09:32.233 --> 09:34.600
I WANT YOU TO CONVINCE HER TO
MAKE THE DECISION FOR HERSELF.

09:34.633 --> 09:36.100
AND HOW AM
I SUPPOSED TO DO THAT?

09:36.133 --> 09:39.800
DR. KAREV, YOU'RE CREATIVE.
YOU'LL THINK OF SOMETHING.

09:39.833 --> 09:41.800
THANK YOU.

09:42.867 --> 09:45.567
(Preston) THIS WILL BE
AN EXTENSIVE OPERATION

09:45.600 --> 09:47.600
EVEN FOR AN OPEN HEART VETERAN
LIKE YOURSELF.

09:47.633 --> 09:50.133
MY ROOM WAS BIGGER LAST TIME.

09:50.167 --> 09:51.600
IT WAS BRIGHTER--MORE SUN.

09:51.633 --> 09:53.767
ALAN, THIS WATER IS WARM.
I NEED MORE ICE.

09:53.800 --> 09:57.200
I'M SENDING YOU IN
FOR A NUCLEAR SCAN.

09:57.233 --> 10:00.100
THEN WE'LL GET YOU
INTO THE O.R. THIS AFTERNOON.

10:00.133 --> 10:01.267
YOU DO UNDERSTAND
ALL OF THE RISKS?

10:01.300 --> 10:02.833
I'VE BEEN THROUGH IT
TOO MANY TIMES

10:02.867 --> 10:04.067
TO NOT UNDERSTAND THE RISKS.

10:04.100 --> 10:05.433
GET THE BLINDS.

10:05.467 --> 10:08.167
OPEN THE BLINDS.
THIS ROOM IS DEPRESSING.

10:08.200 --> 10:10.267
I'LL CHECK BACK
A LITTLE LATER.

10:10.300 --> 10:12.200
TAKE HER FOR
THE THALLIUM SCAN

10:12.233 --> 10:13.333
AND PICK UP HER X-RAYS
ON THE WAY.

10:13.367 --> 10:16.367
DR. BURKE, THANK YOU FOR
CHOOSING ME TO ASSIST YOU TODAY.

10:16.400 --> 10:19.333
WELL, YOU'RE MY GUY,
O'MALLEY.

10:19.367 --> 10:22.500
I AM? I MEAN, YEAH.
HAND ME THE TISSUES.

10:22.533 --> 10:25.433
NO, NO, WAIT.
HOSPITALS HAVE GERMS.

10:25.467 --> 10:28.800
GET MY HAND SANITIZER
OUT OF MY CASE.

10:28.833 --> 10:31.367
WHY WOULD YOU BE WITH SOMEONE
WHO MAKES YOU THAT UNHAPPY?

10:31.400 --> 10:33.633
EXCUSE ME?
I MEAN, LIKE,

10:33.667 --> 10:35.567
WELL, LIKE, YOU'RE HAPPY
WITH CRISTINA.

10:35.600 --> 10:38.800
AND SHE'S HAPPY--WELL, HAPPIER.
YOU KNOW, CRISTINA HAPPY.

10:38.833 --> 10:41.800
WHICH IS NOT NORMAL PEOPLE'S
HAPPY, BUT...

10:43.467 --> 10:46.633
WELL, YOU KNOW, HAPPY SINCE
YOU GUYS STARTED, UH...

10:48.333 --> 10:51.100
SCANS. I'M ON IT.
I'M YOUR GUY...

10:55.300 --> 10:57.300
AND I'M AN IDIOT.

10:57.333 --> 11:00.533
(talking indistinctly)

11:00.567 --> 11:02.067
HI. HELLO. HI. MEREDITH.

11:02.067 --> 11:04.667
MAYBE WE COULD,
YOU KNOW, UH, TALK.

11:04.700 --> 11:08.367
NO.
NO.

11:08.400 --> 11:10.433
OKAY.

11:13.067 --> 11:14.800
(bell dings)
BEEP, BEEP.

11:14.833 --> 11:16.733
WHAT'D YOU DO
TO GET STUCK WITH ME?

11:16.767 --> 11:17.700
NOTHING.

11:17.733 --> 11:19.633
COME ON, I KNOW YOU'RE NOT

11:19.667 --> 11:21.567
JUST WHEELING ME AROUND
FOR KICKS.

11:21.600 --> 11:23.533
WELL, I WAS LATE FOR ROUNDS.
WHY?

11:23.567 --> 11:25.467
OH, 'CAUSE
I HAD THINGS TO DO.

11:25.500 --> 11:26.600
HEY, IZZIE!

11:26.633 --> 11:28.067
IZZIE!

11:30.467 --> 11:32.500
HEY, DOLL FACE.

11:34.567 --> 11:36.467
I WAS GONNA ASK YOU A FAVOR,
YOU KNOW?

11:36.500 --> 11:38.067
I THOUGHT SINCE, YOU KNOW,

11:38.100 --> 11:40.300
MAYBE YOU'RE BETTER
WITH PEOPLE THAN I AM,

11:40.333 --> 11:41.367
I THOUGHT
MAYBE YOU COULD--
NO.

11:41.400 --> 11:43.300
UH, YOU HAVEN'T EVEN HEARD--
NO, NO.

11:43.333 --> 11:45.233
YOU'RE LIKE A BROKEN RECORD.
GOD.

11:45.267 --> 11:47.067
YOU'RE ONLY EVER NICE

11:47.067 --> 11:50.067
OR FRIENDLY OR ANYTHING
WHEN IT'S CONVENIENT FOR YOU.

11:50.100 --> 11:52.767
SO NO TO YOUR FAVOR.
NO TO YOU. NO.

11:52.800 --> 11:54.633
WHAT'S UP WITH YOU?
I PUT ON A DRESS.

11:54.667 --> 11:57.233
I DID MY HAIR.
I HAD ONE NIGHT OFF IN TWO WEEKS

11:57.267 --> 11:59.267
AND I USED IT ON YOU.

11:59.300 --> 12:01.200
AND WHAT DO I GET?
NOTHING.

12:01.233 --> 12:03.067
NO RESPECT, NO APOLOGY...

12:03.100 --> 12:07.133
YOU COULDN'T EVEN BE BOTHERED
TO KISS ME GOOD NIGHT.

12:07.167 --> 12:09.067
YOU KNOW WHAT?
YOU'RE A COWARD,

12:09.100 --> 12:11.700
AND YOU'RE JUST AS SHALLOW
AS YOU SEEM.

12:11.733 --> 12:14.467
SO I AM DONE TRYING
TO BE YOUR FRIEND OR WHATEVER.

12:14.500 --> 12:16.500
I'M OVER IT.

12:19.433 --> 12:21.667
SHE'S REALLY MAD AT YOU.

12:23.233 --> 12:26.100
THIS URINE SAMPLE IS THE LAST
THING WE NEED, MR. HERMAN.

12:26.133 --> 12:27.833
UH...

12:27.867 --> 12:29.433
MEET SHANE'S WIFE TINA.

12:29.467 --> 12:31.067
HEY.

12:31.067 --> 12:32.833
CAN YOU TELL US
WHAT PRECIPITATED

12:32.867 --> 12:34.533
THE PSYCHOTIC EPISODE

12:34.567 --> 12:36.233
THAT GOT YOU ADMITTED
TO THE HOSPITAL?

12:36.267 --> 12:38.167
IT WASN'T AN EPISODE, OKAY?

12:38.200 --> 12:40.633
AND I'M NOT PSYCHOTIC.
I AM PREGNANT.

12:40.667 --> 12:43.667
I MEAN, WOULDN'T YOU FREAK OUT
IF YOU WERE ME?

12:43.700 --> 12:44.667
HONEY, DID YOU BRING IT?

12:44.700 --> 12:47.167
(Tina) YEAH, YEAH.
OH, GOOD.

12:47.200 --> 12:48.433
I CAN PROVE TO EVERYONE
THAT I'M NOT CRAZY.

12:48.467 --> 12:51.067
THAT IS MY PATIENT!
UH-OH.

12:51.100 --> 12:52.467
YEAH, WELL, HE'S OURS NOW,

12:52.500 --> 12:54.800
AND IF YOU WANNA FIGHT ME FOR
IT, I GUARANTEE YOU I'LL WIN.

12:54.833 --> 12:57.067
WHAT IS GOING ON IN HERE?
DR. BAILEY,
JUST ONE MOMENT. HERE.

12:57.100 --> 12:58.633
PLEASE LOOK AT HIS ABDOMEN.

12:58.667 --> 13:00.567
IT'S A MALE HYSTERICAL
PREGNANCY.

13:00.600 --> 13:03.067
IT'S A PSYCH CASE,
AND IT'S MINE.

13:03.100 --> 13:05.300
IT'S NOT HYSTERICAL.
I AM PREGNANT.

13:05.333 --> 13:07.633
SEE? PSYCH.

13:07.667 --> 13:09.700
NO, HIS BELLY IS DISTENDED.
THERE'S NO SIGNS OF ASCITES,

13:09.733 --> 13:11.333
AND I CLEARLY FEEL A MASS

13:11.367 --> 13:13.200
WITH DEEP PALPATION--
SURGICAL.

13:13.233 --> 13:14.800
GUYS.

13:14.833 --> 13:15.733
I TOLD YOU I COULD PROVE IT.
PSYCH.

13:15.767 --> 13:16.933
SURGICAL.

13:16.967 --> 13:19.267
(Miranda) COME ON,
YOU'RE DOCTORS, ACT LIKE IT.
GUYS.

13:19.300 --> 13:21.133
PSYCH.
SURGICAL.

13:21.167 --> 13:22.100
PSYCH.
SURGICAL.

13:22.133 --> 13:23.067
(Izzie) GUYS!

13:23.100 --> 13:25.167
IT'S A PREGNANCY TEST...

13:25.200 --> 13:27.533
AND IT'S POSITIVE.

13:29.067 --> 13:33.400
WELL, HE'S DEFINITELY
A SURGICAL PATIENT NOW.

13:42.133 --> 13:43.733
DO NOT THINK FOR A MOMENT

13:43.767 --> 13:45.733
I CONDONE
STEALING PATIENTS.

13:45.767 --> 13:47.600
THAT SAID, WAY TO GO.

13:47.633 --> 13:50.067
THE FIRST PREGNANCY TEST
I TOOK...
(pager beeps)

13:50.100 --> 13:52.633
WAS A JOKE
TO MAKE TINA LAUGH.

13:52.667 --> 13:56.067
WELL, WE DIDN'T THINK IT WOULD
LEAD TO, YOU KNOW, THIS.

13:56.067 --> 13:57.800
MR. HERMAN,
I CAN ASSURE YOU,

13:57.833 --> 13:59.767
YOU ARE IN NO WAY PREGNANT.
PHEW.

13:59.800 --> 14:02.200
THAT'S A RELIEF--TO HEAR IT,
YOU KNOW, OFFICIALLY,

14:02.233 --> 14:04.133
BUT, HEY,
WHY WAS THAT STICK BLUE?

14:04.167 --> 14:06.500
(Miranda) WELL, THAT'S WHAT
WE'RE GONNA FIND OUT.

14:06.533 --> 14:08.133
UH, STEVENS,
DO A SHOTGUN WORKUP

14:08.167 --> 14:10.100
INCLUDING TUMOR MARKERS

14:10.133 --> 14:12.700
AND GET C.T. TO MAKE
SOME ROOM FOR US IN LINE.

14:12.733 --> 14:15.667
WHAT'S THIS FOR AGAIN?
(pager beeps)

14:15.700 --> 14:18.500
UH, MEDICAL JOURNALS,
MONTHLY CASE REPORTS.

14:18.533 --> 14:19.433
ANNUAL BANQUET
HIGHLIGHT REELS.

14:19.467 --> 14:21.067
(camera shutter clicking)

14:21.100 --> 14:22.833
(pager beeps)

14:22.867 --> 14:25.300
HEY, WHOSE PAGER IS THAT?

14:25.333 --> 14:27.267
UM, MINE, BUT I FOUND HIM.

14:27.300 --> 14:30.333
SO CAN SOMEONE ELSE GO?
NO, WE DON'T
IGNORE PAGES, YANG.

14:34.333 --> 14:37.067
WOULD YOU EXCUSE ME?
SORRY.

14:37.067 --> 14:40.500
WE JUST NEED
TO GET TO THE TOP.

14:40.533 --> 14:42.600
WE'LL BE FINISHED SOON.
RIGHT, DR. BAILEY?

14:42.633 --> 14:44.067
WE, UM...

14:44.100 --> 14:45.333
GOOD.

14:45.367 --> 14:46.433
OOH.

14:46.467 --> 14:48.233
OKAY.

14:49.700 --> 14:51.600
PATIENT IN 4243
NEEDS A RECTAL.

14:51.633 --> 14:54.100
THEN I'VE GOT
TWO INFECTED WOUNDS,

14:54.133 --> 14:59.333
A FOLEY, A GROIN ABSCESS,
FOUR DEBRIDEMENTS, AND, UH...

14:59.367 --> 15:01.633
A CASE OF EXPLOSIVE DIARRHEA.

15:01.667 --> 15:04.567
YOU'RE KIDDING ME, RIGHT?

15:04.600 --> 15:06.533
I'M NOT KNOWN FOR MY HUMOR.

15:06.567 --> 15:08.467
UH, WHY DID
YOU PAGE ME ABOUT--

15:08.500 --> 15:10.400
NONE OF THESE ARE MY PATIENTS.

15:10.433 --> 15:13.233
YOU'RE BAILEY'S INTERN,
RIGHT?
(telephone rings)

15:13.267 --> 15:15.600
THEN THESE ARE YOUR PATIENTS.

15:15.633 --> 15:18.833
DEBBIE HERE.

15:18.867 --> 15:21.700
A PORTION OF THE INTESTINE
IS USED TO ENLARGE THE BLADDER

15:21.733 --> 15:23.633
AND THEN WE CONSTRUCT
A PATHWAY

15:23.667 --> 15:25.567
TO A HOLE
IN THE BELLY BUTTON.

15:25.600 --> 15:27.500
IT'S A VERY TINY HOLE.
IT'S VIRTUALLY INVISIBLE.

15:27.533 --> 15:29.433
SHE COULD WEAR A BIKINI.
NO ONE WOULD EVER KNOW.

15:29.467 --> 15:31.567
WHY WOULD SHE NEED A BIKINI?
SHE DOESN'T KNOW HOW TO SWIM.

15:31.600 --> 15:33.500
SHE COULD GO TO THE BEACH,
LIE IN THE SUN,

15:33.533 --> 15:35.233
HANG OUT WITH HER FRIENDS.

15:35.267 --> 15:38.133
OH, MY GOD.
SHE'S SO SELF-CONSCIOUS NOW.

15:38.167 --> 15:40.067
NICOLE COULD HAVE FRIENDS
HER OWN AGE, ELAINE.

15:40.100 --> 15:41.067
WHEN DID YOU SAY NICOLE
WOULD BE BACK?

15:41.100 --> 15:43.233
AFTER HER LABS. NOW JUST THINK
ABOUT HER FUTURE.

15:43.267 --> 15:46.367
NICOLE COULD BE INDEPENDENT. SHE
COULD GO TO COLLEGE ANYWHERE.

15:46.400 --> 15:49.667
SHE COULD HAVE A JOB,
HAVE HER OWN APARTMENT,

15:49.700 --> 15:52.567
DATE, GET MARRIED.
THESE LABS ARE TAKIN'
A LONG TIME.

15:52.600 --> 15:55.067
SHE CAN SPEND MORE THAN
20 MINUTES AWAY FROM US, ELAINE.

15:55.100 --> 15:56.833
I'M ASKING ABOUT
MY ONLY CHILD.

15:56.867 --> 15:58.667
SHE'S NOT A CHILD ANYMORE.

15:58.700 --> 16:01.367
SHE'S MY CHILD.
SHE'LL ALWAYS BE MY CHILD.

16:03.133 --> 16:05.067
ALAN, WATCH YOUR STEP.
YOU'RE HITTING MY CHAIR.

16:05.067 --> 16:06.800
I'M SORRY.
AND HOLD ONTO MY BAG.

16:06.833 --> 16:08.733
I GOT IT.
AND DON'T RUMMAGE THROUGH IT.

16:08.767 --> 16:10.267
I WON'T.

16:10.300 --> 16:12.367
(Woman)
DR. BARRONS, DR. BARRONS...

16:12.400 --> 16:16.067
"PLEASE" AND "THANK YOUS"
WERE NEVER HER STRONG SUIT.

16:16.067 --> 16:17.800
YOU'RE A VERY PATIENT PERSON.

16:17.833 --> 16:19.733
YEARS OF PRACTICE. OOPS.

16:19.767 --> 16:21.500
OH, SHE WON'T SEE THAT.

16:21.533 --> 16:24.400
I JUST TRY TO KEEP HER CALM.

16:24.433 --> 16:27.233
YOU KNOW, THEY DIDN'T THINK
SHE WAS GONNA SURVIVE

16:27.267 --> 16:29.533
THE FIRST SURGERY,
LET ALONE THREE MORE.

16:29.567 --> 16:32.700
BUT HERE IT IS TEN YEARS LATER,
SHE'S STILL HERE.

16:32.733 --> 16:34.633
YEAH, IT'S,
UH, IT'S A MIRACLE

16:34.667 --> 16:36.567
THAT SHE'S STILL ALIVE.

16:36.600 --> 16:38.500
THAT'S WHAT EVERYONE SAYS.

16:38.533 --> 16:40.067
WHAT DO YOU SAY?

16:40.067 --> 16:42.800
UH, IT'S RIGHT THERE
IN THE VOWS.

16:42.833 --> 16:45.700
IN SICKNESS
AND IN HEALTH, RIGHT?

16:45.733 --> 16:48.400
THANKS.

16:54.133 --> 16:56.233
A PREGNANT GUY?

16:56.267 --> 16:59.167
YOU HAD A PREGNANT GUY,
AND YOU DIDN'T TELL ME?

16:59.200 --> 17:01.100
WELL, WE CAN GET YOU FLOOR SPACE
IN THE O.R. FOR 50 BUCKS.

17:01.133 --> 17:02.733
YOU'RE SELLING TICKETS,

17:02.767 --> 17:04.567
AND WE DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHAT'S WRONG WITH HIM.

17:04.600 --> 17:06.133
WHATEVER HE'S GOT INSIDE
HAS GOT TO COME OUT.

17:06.167 --> 17:07.733
WE'RE JUST BROKERING
A FEW DEALS.

17:07.767 --> 17:10.367
SORT OF LIKE BACKSTAGE PASSES.
YOU WANT IN ON THE CASH?
NO.

17:10.400 --> 17:13.233
I DIDN'T GET A PREGNANT GUY.
I WAS BURKE'S NEW GO-TO GUY,

17:13.267 --> 17:15.167
BUT THAT'S OVER THANKS TO YOU.

17:15.200 --> 17:17.500
HE DIDN'T KNOW THAT I KNEW
ABOUT YOU TWO.
STOP TALKING.

17:17.533 --> 17:20.400
WHAT ON EARTH?

17:20.433 --> 17:23.067
***

17:28.733 --> 17:30.800
HI.

17:30.833 --> 17:33.333

17:33.367 --> 17:35.367
YEAH, I LIKE HER ALREADY.

17:35.400 --> 17:37.367
DON'T ASK.
WHY? IT'S NOT LIKE
WE CAN READ YOUR MIND.

17:37.400 --> 17:39.667
IT'S NOT LIKE WE HAVE ANY IDEA

17:39.700 --> 17:42.200
WHAT'S GOING ON IN YOUR TINY,
TINY, TINY LITTLE BRAIN.
SHE HAS A POINT.

17:42.233 --> 17:45.300
(pager beeping)
OH! I AM HUNGRY!

17:45.333 --> 17:47.233
SO THIS IS COOL.

17:47.267 --> 17:51.467
A REAL LIVE LUNCHTIME IN A REAL
CAFETERIA WITH TRAYS AND--

17:51.500 --> 17:53.467
AND FRIENDS.
WE'RE NOT HIS FRIENDS.

17:53.500 --> 17:55.433
(George) DON'T YOU HAVE
A CAFETERIA AT YOUR SCHOOL?

17:55.467 --> 17:57.367
I'M HOMESCHOOLED
BY MY PARENTS.
THAT EXPLAINS A LOT.

17:57.400 --> 18:00.633
SO ARE YOU GUYS THE COOL KIDS
AROUND HERE OR SOMETHING?

18:00.667 --> 18:02.200
WHAT WOULD MAKE YOU
THINK THAT?

18:02.233 --> 18:04.267
IT SEEMS LIKE
EVERYONE'S TALKING ABOUT YOU.

18:04.300 --> 18:07.567
***

18:13.700 --> 18:17.633
THE GUYS AND I WERE TAKIN' BETS

WELL, I KNOW IT'S NOT FAT,

18:28.633 --> 18:30.533
JEEZ.

18:30.567 --> 18:33.433

18:33.467 --> 18:36.233

I WAS TOLD TO PAGE YOU

18:40.567 --> 18:42.467
WHO TOLD YOU, BAILEY?

18:42.500 --> 18:44.400
(patient vomits)
OH, NO.

18:44.433 --> 18:46.667
OH, YES,
AND ALL I CAN SAY IS

18:46.700 --> 18:49.267
YOU MUST'VE MADE
ONE SERIOUS FAUX PAS.

18:49.300 --> 18:52.200
I HATE VOMIT.

18:52.233 --> 18:54.167
YOU'RE GONNA NEED THIS.

18:54.200 --> 18:57.367
***

19:01.300 --> 19:04.067
(patient vomits)

19:09.533 --> 19:13.467
(Woman)
DR. NORTON, DR. NORTON...

19:13.500 --> 19:15.400
BAILEY KNOWS.

19:19.067 --> 19:20.400
KNOWS WHAT?

19:20.433 --> 19:22.167
SHE KNOWS.

19:22.200 --> 19:24.800
O'MALLEY KNOWS.
WHY NOT BAILEY?

19:24.833 --> 19:26.733
SO YOU DIDN'T TELL HER?

19:26.767 --> 19:27.567
WHY WOULD I DO THAT?
THIS IS BAD.

19:27.600 --> 19:29.633
WE HAVE TO MANAGE
THE DAMAGE OURSELVES

19:29.667 --> 19:31.833
BEFORE THIS THING SPINS
TOO FAR OUT OF CONTROL,

19:31.867 --> 19:33.600
AND THAT MEANS COMING CLEAN
TO THE CHIEF.
WHAT?

19:33.633 --> 19:35.533
IF WE COME OUT IN THE OPEN,
THEN NO ONE HAS ANYTHING TO SAY.

19:35.567 --> 19:37.333
NO. NO. NO WAY. NO WAY.
THAT'S THE ONLY WAY.

19:37.367 --> 19:38.200
GOOD MORNING.

19:38.233 --> 19:40.433
MORNING, CHIEF.
THANK YOU, DR. BURKE.

19:40.467 --> 19:44.300
YOU'RE WELCOME. AHEM.
GREAT BOARD, CHIEF.

19:48.667 --> 19:50.167
WOULD YOU MAKE SURE

19:50.200 --> 19:52.667
THAT THEY GET THE BREATHING TUBE
OUT OF MY THROAT

19:52.700 --> 19:54.800
RIGHT AFTER SURGERY THIS TIME?

19:54.833 --> 19:56.533
ARE YOU TRYING

19:56.567 --> 19:58.467
TO CUT OFF MY CIRCULATION?

19:58.500 --> 20:01.133
HE'S JUST DOIN' HIS JOB.

20:01.167 --> 20:03.167
WHAT DID YOU SAY?

20:03.200 --> 20:06.200
I SAID,
"HE'S JUST DOIN' HIS JOB."

20:06.233 --> 20:09.767
WELL, I DON'T REALLY CARE
WHOSE JOB HE'S DOING.

20:09.800 --> 20:11.700
HE'S SQUEEZING MY ARM OFF.

20:11.733 --> 20:13.733
ARE YOU JUST GONNA SIT THERE?

20:15.100 --> 20:17.600
(sighs)
SHUT UP, KIM.

20:19.500 --> 20:21.333
JUST...

20:21.367 --> 20:24.300
SHUT UP, HUH?
(George) HEY.

20:24.333 --> 20:27.333
YOU COMPLAIN TO ME,
ABOUT ME...
LOOK, MAYBE...

20:27.367 --> 20:29.267
AROUND ME ALL DAY...

20:29.300 --> 20:31.200
EVERY DAY.

20:31.233 --> 20:35.233
A LITTLE SILENCE
WOULD BE NICE.

20:35.267 --> 20:38.533
A FEW MEASLY MINUTES
OF QUIET.
LISTEN. LISTEN.

20:38.567 --> 20:40.467
(monitor beeping)
CAN'T YOU FOR ONCE...

20:40.500 --> 20:42.400
MR. GRISWOLD.
IN YOUR LIFE...

20:42.433 --> 20:45.333
JUST SHUT UP?!

20:45.367 --> 20:47.333
(monitor beeping rapidly)
(gasping)

20:56.500 --> 20:59.200
(monitor beeping rapidly)
WHAT HAVE WE GOT?

20:59.233 --> 21:03.467
SHE HAD A LEVINE SIGN AND HER
E.K.G. SHOWS S.T. ELEVATIONS.

21:03.500 --> 21:05.067
SHE'S HAVIN' A HEART ATTACK.

21:05.067 --> 21:06.733
GIVE HER 4 MIGS
OF MORPHINE.

21:06.767 --> 21:09.367
RUN NITRO
10 MICS PER MINUTE.

21:09.400 --> 21:11.267
LET'S DO THIS FAST SO WE CAN
GET INTO SURGERY, PEOPLE.

21:11.300 --> 21:13.733
OH, I DID THIS.

21:15.100 --> 21:18.067
I DID THIS TO HER.

21:18.067 --> 21:20.200
(Miranda) LOOK,
MESENTERIC TERATOMA, CHIEF.

21:20.233 --> 21:22.133
IN AN ADULT MALE.
IS THIS POSSIBLE?

21:22.167 --> 21:25.667
IT IS NOW.
LARGE BILOBED CYSTIC LESION...

21:25.700 --> 21:27.600
(Izzie) WITH A SOLID
CALCIFIED STRUCTURE.

21:27.633 --> 21:30.567
(Richard) A DEFORMED MANDIBLE.

21:30.600 --> 21:33.233
(Miranda) LABS SHOW
ELEVATED H.C.G. LEVELS.

21:33.267 --> 21:35.533
THAT EXPLAINS THE FALSE POSITIVE
ON THE PREGNANCY TEST.

21:35.567 --> 21:37.467
(Izzie) WHICH ALSO MEANS...

21:37.500 --> 21:38.667
IT'S PROBABLY MALIGNANT.

21:38.700 --> 21:41.100
(Meredith) YOU OKAY?

21:41.133 --> 21:43.067
YOU LOOK A LITTLE GREEN.

21:43.067 --> 21:46.600
I THINK
HE NEEDS SOME AIR, CHIEF.

21:46.633 --> 21:48.533
(Richard) DEEP BREATHS,
MR. HERMAN.

21:48.567 --> 21:51.233
JUST--MOST OF THIS
MEDICAL SPEAK

21:51.267 --> 21:52.600
GOES RIGHT OVER MY HEAD.

21:52.633 --> 21:54.533
YOU HAVE WHAT'S CALLED
A TERATOMA,

21:54.567 --> 21:56.733
AND IT'S REALLY
VERY RARE IN ADULTS.

21:56.767 --> 21:58.433
(Meredith) WHICH IS WHY
YOU'RE SO POPULAR.

21:58.467 --> 22:00.367
IT'S JUST A MASS OF CELLS

22:00.400 --> 22:03.067
THAT'S PROBABLY BEEN THERE
YOUR WHOLE LIFE, ONLY NOW--

22:03.067 --> 22:04.800
NOW IT'S GROWING.
YEAH, GROWING JAWBONES

22:04.833 --> 22:07.100
AND TOENAILS
AND, UH, CLUMPS OF HAIR.

22:07.133 --> 22:08.700
YEAH, I'VE BEEN LISTENIN'.

22:08.733 --> 22:10.833
IT'S JUST NO ONE'S
REALLY TALKING TO US.

22:10.867 --> 22:13.633
JUST ABOUT YOU.
I KNOW WHAT THAT'S LIKE.

22:13.667 --> 22:15.700
UM, HI. WHAT'D I MISS?

22:15.733 --> 22:18.433
EW, IS THAT...

22:18.467 --> 22:22.067
IS THAT RECTAL JELLY
ON YOUR SCRUBS?

22:23.233 --> 22:25.367
(pager beeping)

22:25.400 --> 22:26.367
MM.

22:26.400 --> 22:28.567
DR. BAILEY,
ALL THE ATTENTION,

22:28.600 --> 22:31.233
ALL THE PEOPLE
ARE MAKING THEM PANIC.

22:31.267 --> 22:33.067
(Miranda) OH.

22:34.767 --> 22:38.533
YOU KNOW, WHEN YOU SAID YOU
FOUND A LUNCH SPOT WITH A VIEW,

22:38.567 --> 22:40.467
I KNEW I SHOULD HAVE
TAKEN YOU LITERALLY.

22:40.500 --> 22:43.300
I FOUND IT IN
MY "BEST OF SEATTLE" GUIDE.

22:43.333 --> 22:45.233
IT'S HARDLY
BROWN BAGGING IT ON THE TOP

22:45.267 --> 22:47.367
OF THE EMPIRE STATE BUILDING,
BUT...

22:47.400 --> 22:50.100
THEY DID HAVE THESE
CUTE LITTLE VIEWFINDERS.

22:50.133 --> 22:52.067
YOU ALWAYS FIND SOMETHING
TO COMPLAIN ABOUT.

22:52.067 --> 22:56.433
OKAY, IS THERE ANYTHING THAT
YOU LIKE ABOUT ME ANYMORE?

22:56.467 --> 22:59.567
BECAUSE IF THERE IS,
I REALLY NEED TO KNOW NOW.

22:59.600 --> 23:02.667
WELL, I LIKE THAT YOU LIKE
CUTE LITTLE VIEWFINDERS

23:02.700 --> 23:04.600
IN EVERY CITY YOU LIVE IN.

23:04.633 --> 23:07.067
I DON'T LIVE HERE YET.

23:07.100 --> 23:09.700
***

23:11.600 --> 23:14.467
ARE YOU GOING TO STOP TALKING
TO MEREDITH?

23:14.500 --> 23:16.400
I WILL.
WHEN...

23:16.433 --> 23:18.333
TODAY, TOMORROW, NEXT WEEK?

23:18.367 --> 23:21.733
MAYBE I'M NOT READY YET.

23:21.767 --> 23:25.600
ARE YOU EVER
GONNA BE READY, DEREK?

23:25.633 --> 23:28.400
WHAT IF I SAY NO?

23:28.433 --> 23:31.633
THEN I'M NOT MOVING HERE.

23:31.667 --> 23:35.633
THEN I GUESS
WE'RE AT AN IMPASSE THEN.

23:40.133 --> 23:41.767
***

23:41.800 --> 23:43.233
DR. YANG...

23:43.267 --> 23:45.167
WE NEVER FINISHED
OUR CONVERSATION.

23:45.200 --> 23:47.100
YES, WE DID.
WE DECIDED

23:47.133 --> 23:49.067
WE'RE NOT GONNA TELL
YOU KNOW WHO ABOUT US.

23:49.067 --> 23:50.600
OH, WE DECIDED?

23:50.633 --> 23:53.100
IF YOU'RE WORRIED ABOUT
YOUR CAREER AND YOUR REPUTATION,

23:53.133 --> 23:54.833
THEY'RE IN MUCH MORE DANGER
IF HE HEARS ABOUT US

23:54.867 --> 23:57.367
THROUGH THE GRAPEVINE.
HE DOESN'T HAVE
TO HEAR ABOUT US AT ALL.

23:57.400 --> 23:59.300
ONLY HE WILL.
IT'S JUST A MATTER OF TIME.

23:59.333 --> 24:01.233
UNLESS YOU'RE HESITATING
BECAUSE OF SOME--

24:01.267 --> 24:03.067
SOME DIFFERENT REASON.

24:03.100 --> 24:05.100
OKAY, YOU ARE NOT
THINKING THIS THROUGH.

24:05.133 --> 24:08.767
LIKE YOU NOT WANTING TO ADMIT
TO THIS RELATIONSHIP AT ALL?

24:08.800 --> 24:12.133
WE ARE A COUPLE.

24:15.533 --> 24:17.433
FINE.

24:17.467 --> 24:18.700
BURKE.

24:18.733 --> 24:20.600
I SAID, "FINE."

24:20.633 --> 24:23.267
(Cristina sighs)

24:25.133 --> 24:27.400
SO WHAT'S UP WITH YOU NOT
WANTING TO GET THIS PROCEDURE?

24:27.433 --> 24:29.333
I'M FINE THE WAY I AM.

24:29.367 --> 24:32.233
GOOD POINT. YOUR CHOICE.

24:34.233 --> 24:37.633
SO YOU'RE NOT GONNA
TRY AND TALK ME INTO IT?

24:37.667 --> 24:39.667
RIGHT NOW, I'M GONNA STUDY.

24:39.700 --> 24:44.700
"NUCLEAR SOMETHING
FANCY NAME-OLOGY."

24:44.733 --> 24:46.200
YEAH.

24:46.233 --> 24:48.233
IS THAT WHY YOU WERE LATE--
YOU WERE STUDYING?

24:48.267 --> 24:49.333
NO.

24:49.367 --> 24:52.100
IS THAT GIRL IZZIE
YOUR GIRLFRIEND?

24:52.133 --> 24:53.200
NO.

24:53.233 --> 24:56.367
DO YOU WANT HER
TO BE YOUR GIRLFRIEND?

24:56.400 --> 24:58.300
LOOK, I GOT STUCK WITH YOU
BECAUSE I WAS LATE FOR ROUNDS.

24:58.333 --> 25:00.533
SO IF YOU DON'T MIND, KID,
I'M KINDA BUSY.

25:00.567 --> 25:03.533
I'M 18, YOU KNOW.

25:03.567 --> 25:04.633
WHAT?

25:04.667 --> 25:07.533
I'M NOT A KID. I'M 18, AND...
AND I DON'T HAVE TO

25:07.567 --> 25:09.467
STAY DOWN HERE WITH YOU.
I COULD GO BACK TO MY ROOM.

25:09.500 --> 25:12.267
SO GO.

25:13.167 --> 25:16.133
IZZIE'S RIGHT.

25:16.167 --> 25:18.067
YOU'RE AN ASS.
I'M NOT AN ASS.

25:18.067 --> 25:19.700
OKAY,
I AM AN ASS...

25:19.733 --> 25:22.733
BUT I'M A CUTE ASS, RIGHT?

25:24.567 --> 25:27.567
HOW COME
YOU DIDN'T KISS HER?

25:27.600 --> 25:30.333
I THOUGHT
YOU WERE LEAVING.

25:30.367 --> 25:32.267
IF I HAD A CHANCE
TO KISS SOMEONE I LIKED,

25:32.300 --> 25:34.200
I WOULDN'T HESITATE.

25:34.233 --> 25:37.100
IF I HAD THE CHANCE TO LOSE
THE URINE BAG AROUND MY ANKLE,

25:37.133 --> 25:38.467
I WOULDN'T HESITATE, EITHER.
BUT THEN AGAIN,

25:38.500 --> 25:41.100
I DON'T LET MY MOMMY
DO ALL MY TALKING FOR ME.

25:43.200 --> 25:46.300
I DON'T LIKE YOU.
YES, YOU DO.

25:46.333 --> 25:47.767
JERK.
MOTORMOUTH.

25:47.800 --> 25:50.067
BABYSITTER.
2-WHEELER.

25:50.067 --> 25:52.500
NOW THAT'S JUST POLITICALLY
INCORRECT.

25:54.467 --> 25:55.667
YEAH.

25:55.700 --> 25:57.233
OKAY.

25:57.267 --> 26:01.133
LOOKS LIKE
MRS. GRISWOLD IS DOIN' WELL.

26:01.167 --> 26:03.067
WAIT A MINUTE...

26:03.067 --> 26:04.267
JUST A LITTLE SUCTION.

26:04.300 --> 26:07.300
WE'LL FIX THE MECHANICAL
STABILIZER LATER.

26:07.333 --> 26:09.233
RIGHT NOW
I'M JUST GONNA HIT

26:09.267 --> 26:12.467
A FEW--A FEW
OF THESE LITTLE BLEEDERS.

26:23.600 --> 26:25.500
(Cristina) LOOK AT THAT.

26:25.533 --> 26:29.167
A PERFECTLY EXPOSED,
PARTIALLY-NUMB BEATING HEART.

26:29.200 --> 26:32.700
IT'S A BEAUTIFUL THING.
CODE RED!

26:32.733 --> 26:34.600
OH MY GOD.

26:34.633 --> 26:36.300
I THINK IT JUST BURST
INTO FLAMES.

26:36.333 --> 26:38.467
HER HEART--IT'S ON FIRE.
WE HAVE TO SAVE
MRS. GRISWOLD.

26:38.500 --> 26:40.067
BEGIN FIRE PROTOCOL.
I'M ON IT.

26:40.100 --> 26:41.467
CODE RED!
BEGIN FIRE PROTOCOL!

26:41.500 --> 26:43.400
MOVE, PEOPLE!
WE NEED WET TOWELS.

26:43.433 --> 26:45.700
O'MALLEY, DISCONNECT
THE ELECTRICAL LEADS.
I GOT IT.

26:45.733 --> 26:47.300
LET'S GO, ROOKIE.

26:47.333 --> 26:49.567
ANY UNNECESSARY PERSONNEL
IN THIS ROOM, EVACUATE NOW.

26:49.600 --> 26:51.600
SHUT DOWN THE O2.
ALREADY ON IT.

26:51.633 --> 26:55.467
START MANUAL RESPIRATION.

26:57.333 --> 26:58.800
I'VE GOT THE AMBU BAG.

26:58.833 --> 27:00.600
STARTING
MANUAL RESPIRATION.

27:00.633 --> 27:03.100
WE'VE GOT TO CONTROL
THIS BLEEDING.

27:03.133 --> 27:05.500
HER VITALS ARE STABILIZING.

27:06.500 --> 27:09.133
WE MIGHT JUST
HAVE A CHANCE HERE.

27:13.833 --> 27:15.733
SHE WAS ON FIRE.

27:15.767 --> 27:17.667
I HAVE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING
LIKE THAT. WHAT WAS THAT?

27:17.700 --> 27:19.067
IT WAS A FREAK ACCIDENT.

27:19.067 --> 27:20.567
BUT SHE WAS ON FIRE.

27:20.600 --> 27:22.500
ALL RIGHT.
YOU ALREADY SAID THAT.

27:22.533 --> 27:24.067
I KNOW, BUT SHE WAS.

27:24.067 --> 27:25.800
GEORGE, YOU OKAY?

27:25.833 --> 27:27.267
SHE WAS ON FIRE.

27:27.300 --> 27:29.267
HEY.

27:29.300 --> 27:31.333
THAT WAS INTENSE.
ARE YOU OKAY, OR...

27:31.367 --> 27:34.267
I'M FINE. O'MALLEY, LET'S GO.

27:35.800 --> 27:38.167
(pager beeps)

27:38.200 --> 27:43.067
(sighs) I'M SO OVER THIS.

27:46.100 --> 27:48.533
HEY, I HEARD A HEART
CAUGHT ON FIRE IN THE O.R.

27:48.567 --> 27:50.467
I AM THE BEST INTERN
YOU'VE GOT,

27:50.500 --> 27:53.267
AND YOU ARE WASTING ME
ON PUKE AND BOILS,

27:53.300 --> 27:55.133
AND I GET IT. I--

27:55.167 --> 27:57.067
I EVEN DESERVE IT,
BUT PLEASE,

27:57.100 --> 27:58.833
YOU CAN'T KEEP ME AWAY
FROM THIS SURGERY.

27:58.867 --> 28:01.600
I EARNED THIS SURGERY.
I STOLE THE SURGERY.

28:01.633 --> 28:05.167
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKIN' ABOUT, YANG?
YOU, PUNISHING ME.

28:07.533 --> 28:10.300
(Woman)
DR. BARRONS, DR. BARRONS...

28:10.333 --> 28:12.800
YOU HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT, DO YOU?

28:12.833 --> 28:14.367
WELL, THEN, LIKE,

28:14.400 --> 28:16.233
WHO HAS BEEN
PAGING ME ALL DAY?

28:16.267 --> 28:18.167
THE NURSES HAVE BEEN
ON ME NONSTOP.

28:18.200 --> 28:19.533
A LITTLE BIT OF RESPECT,

28:19.567 --> 28:21.067
AND YOU COULD'VE
SAVED YOURSELF

28:21.100 --> 28:24.267
A VERY LONG DAY, DR. YANG.

28:26.400 --> 28:30.567
PISSING OFF THE NURSES.
STUPID.

28:30.600 --> 28:33.333
WELL, I CAN
STILL SCRUB IN, RIGHT?

28:33.367 --> 28:34.800
HE WANTS ME TO MOVE HERE,
RICHARD--

28:34.833 --> 28:36.733
TO PICK UP EVERYTHING
AND MOVE.

28:36.767 --> 28:39.233
DON'T STAY FOR HIM,
ADDISON.

28:39.267 --> 28:40.700
STAY FOR ME.

28:40.733 --> 28:42.333
STAY FOR YOURSELF.
RICHARD, I--

28:42.367 --> 28:44.267
LOOK, IN SEATTLE, YOU COULD BE
FRONT PAGE NEWS.

28:44.300 --> 28:46.133
WITH YOUR REPUTATION

28:46.167 --> 28:48.067
AND THE MONEY I'LL PUT
INTO PROMOTING YOU,

28:48.100 --> 28:49.833
SEATTLE GRACE WILL BECOME
ONE OF THE FOREMOST

28:49.867 --> 28:52.733
NEONATAL HOSPITALS
WEST OF MANHATTAN.

28:57.800 --> 28:59.567
YOU'RE SERIOUS.

28:59.600 --> 29:02.300
I'M READY TO PUT MY MONEY
WHERE MY MOUTH IS.

29:02.333 --> 29:05.333
***

29:11.133 --> 29:12.633
TURN AROUND. WALK AWAY.

29:12.667 --> 29:14.800
FROM WHO?
FROM MY INTERN.

29:14.833 --> 29:16.567
WELL, I WASN'T.

29:16.600 --> 29:18.733
YEAH--YEAH.
YES, YOU WERE.

29:18.767 --> 29:20.667
COME ON, LOOK--LOOK,
YOU CAN'T DO THIS.

29:20.700 --> 29:22.467
YOU DON'T HAVE THE RIGHT.
NOT ANYMORE.

29:22.500 --> 29:24.600
I JUST WANNA FIND OUT
IF SHE'S OKAY.
NO, SHE'S NOT.

29:24.633 --> 29:26.667
SHE'S A HUMAN TRAFFIC ACCIDENT,

29:26.700 --> 29:28.633
AND EVERYBODY'S SLOWIN' DOWN
TO LOOK AT THE WRECKAGE.

29:28.667 --> 29:32.100
SHE'S DOIN' THE BEST SHE CAN
WITH WHAT SHE HAS LEFT.

29:32.133 --> 29:34.067
LOOK, I KNOW YOU CAN'T SEE THIS
BECAUSE YOU'RE IN IT,

29:34.067 --> 29:36.067
BUT YOU CAN'T HELP HER NOW.

29:36.100 --> 29:39.767
YOU'LL ONLY MAKE IT WORSE.
WALK AWAY. LEAVE HER TO MEND.

29:43.633 --> 29:45.133
GO ON.

29:50.433 --> 29:53.500
IT'S NOT THAT I DON'T WANT
THE OPERATION. I DO, YOU KNOW.

29:53.533 --> 29:55.133
I WANT THINGS.

29:55.167 --> 29:57.067
IT'S JUST...

29:57.100 --> 29:58.833
WHAT IF I'M NOT READY?

29:58.867 --> 30:00.767
READY FOR WHAT?

30:00.800 --> 30:05.167
FOR EVERYTHING--
FOR TAKING CARE OF MYSELF,

30:05.200 --> 30:09.467
FOR BEING ON MY OWN,
FOR SEX.

30:09.500 --> 30:12.433
FOR LOVE.

30:13.433 --> 30:17.133
I'VE NEVER HAD
A BOYFRIEND.

30:17.167 --> 30:21.033
I'VE NEVER EVEN
BEEN KISSED.

30:21.067 --> 30:23.800
I'M, LIKE, THE OLDEST LIVING
PROSPECTIVE COLLEGE FRESHMAN

30:23.833 --> 30:25.733
NOT TO GO TO FIRST BASE.

30:25.767 --> 30:27.667
NAH.

30:27.700 --> 30:29.600
(laughs) IT'S MORTIFYING.

30:29.633 --> 30:33.200
THERE ARE WAY OLDER
LOSERS THAN YOU. TRUST ME.

30:39.233 --> 30:42.233
ALEX...

30:42.267 --> 30:45.333
WOULD YOU KISS ME?

30:45.367 --> 30:48.333
WH--WHAT?

30:48.367 --> 30:50.567
I KNOW YOU'RE A DOCTOR,
I'M YOUR PATIENT

30:50.600 --> 30:54.633
AND IT'S AGAINST THE RULES,
BUT I WOULD NEVER TELL ANYONE.

30:54.667 --> 30:57.500
***

31:06.400 --> 31:10.133
FOR A KISS TO BE
REALLY GOOD,

31:10.167 --> 31:11.300
YOU WANT IT
TO MEAN SOMETHING.

31:11.333 --> 31:14.667
YOU WANT IT
TO BE WITH SOMEONE

31:14.700 --> 31:16.833
YOU CAN'T
GET OUT OF YOUR HEAD,

31:16.867 --> 31:19.567
SO THAT WHEN YOUR LIPS FINALLY
TOUCH, YOU FEEL IT EVERYWHERE.

31:19.600 --> 31:21.500
A KISS SO HOT AND SO DEEP,

31:21.533 --> 31:23.533
YOU NEVER
WANNA COME UP FOR AIR.

31:25.700 --> 31:28.600
YOU CAN'T CHEAT
YOUR FIRST KISS, NICOLE.

31:28.633 --> 31:31.367
TRUST ME,
YOU DON'T WANT TO,

31:31.400 --> 31:33.400
'CAUSE WHEN YOU FIND
THAT RIGHT PERSON,

31:33.433 --> 31:37.367
THE FIRST KISS...
IT'S EVERYTHING.

31:37.400 --> 31:40.233
***

31:42.733 --> 31:44.633
HER HEART--
(Preston)
CAUGHT ON FIRE. YES.

31:44.667 --> 31:46.567
THERE WILL, OF COURSE,
BE AN INVESTIGATION,

31:46.600 --> 31:50.567
BUT YOU SHOULD KNOW, THIS IS NOT
AS UNUSUAL AS IT SOUNDS.

31:50.600 --> 31:52.667
YOUR WIFE
IS GOING TO BE FINE.

31:52.700 --> 31:55.500
SHE'S WELL. UM,
WE COMPLETED THE OPERATION

31:55.533 --> 31:58.433
AND I EXPECT THAT SHE WILL
MAKE A FULL RECOVERY.

31:58.467 --> 32:02.200
OH.

32:04.567 --> 32:06.300
OH.

32:07.633 --> 32:09.533
MR. GRISWOLD?

32:09.567 --> 32:13.433
(laughing)

32:18.267 --> 32:20.667
SO THAT'S IT, ISN'T IT?

32:22.167 --> 32:24.767
HER HEART CAUGHT ON FIRE

32:24.800 --> 32:29.567
IN THE MIDDLE OF HER FIFTH
OPEN HEART OPERATION

32:29.600 --> 32:32.167
AND SHE SURVIVED?
(laughing)

32:36.600 --> 32:40.433
WHOA. WELL...

32:40.467 --> 32:43.333
SHE'S LIKE SOME, UH...

32:43.367 --> 32:46.133
SOME MYTHICAL MONSTER.

32:46.167 --> 32:48.433
(laughs)

32:48.467 --> 32:51.733
SHE'S NEVER GONNA DIE!
UH, MR. GRISWOLD...

32:51.767 --> 32:53.267
MR. GRISWOLD.
MM-HMM.

32:53.300 --> 32:55.667
I KNOW THIS IS AN EMOTIONAL
TIME FOR YOU.

32:55.700 --> 32:58.067
UM, IF YOU'D LIKE TO WAIT...

32:58.067 --> 32:59.700
WAIT? NO, NO.

32:59.733 --> 33:03.367
I'M NOT WAITING ANY LONGER.

33:08.467 --> 33:10.367
YOU TELL HER...

33:10.400 --> 33:13.833
TELL HER...HELL.

33:13.867 --> 33:18.633
TELL HER SHE'LL SURVIVE

33:18.667 --> 33:21.667
WITHOUT ME. (laughing)

33:28.733 --> 33:30.400
(indistinct talking)

33:30.433 --> 33:32.567
WE CAN ADD TWO MORE,
STANDING ROOM ONLY.

33:32.600 --> 33:34.700
HEY, HANDS OFF.

33:34.733 --> 33:37.300
(Meredith) WHAT IS GOING ON
IN HERE?

33:37.333 --> 33:38.800
EVERYBODY OUT!

33:38.833 --> 33:40.200
WE ALREADY HAVE--
OUT!

33:40.233 --> 33:41.833
MR. HERMAN IS A PATIENT--

33:41.867 --> 33:45.800
A SURGICAL PATIENT
WHO'S SICK AND EMBARRASSED

33:45.833 --> 33:47.500
AND TIRED OF BEING STARED AT.

33:47.533 --> 33:51.567
YOU TWO--THIS ISN'T A ZOO!
OUT! OUT!

33:51.600 --> 33:53.267
OUT! YOU KNOW WHAT?

33:53.300 --> 33:55.133
IF ALL OF YOU WANT TO POINT

33:55.167 --> 33:57.067
AND WHISPER AND STARE AT ME,
KNOCK YOURSELVES OUT.

33:57.100 --> 33:58.300
"LOOK AT MEREDITH.

33:58.333 --> 34:00.767
"ISN'T SHE SAD AND PATHETIC
AND HEARTBROKEN?

34:00.800 --> 34:02.367
"MAYBE SHE'S GONE MENTAL."

34:02.400 --> 34:07.633
MAYBE I HAVE,
BUT LEAVE MR. HERMAN ALONE.

34:07.667 --> 34:10.567
YOU SHOULD BE ASHAMED
OF YOURSELF.

34:15.367 --> 34:19.300
AND WHAT
ARE YOU LOOKING AT?

34:34.300 --> 34:38.400
SO--SO DO YOU TELL HIS WIFE
OR SHOULD I?

34:38.433 --> 34:41.233
(laughing)
HEY.

34:44.833 --> 34:47.800
HEH HEH. THIS IS--
(laughing)

34:48.600 --> 34:50.600
I...

34:52.467 --> 34:55.367
(Woman)
DR. BARRONS, DR. BARRONS...

34:55.400 --> 34:58.233
I WANT TO THANK YOU...

34:58.267 --> 35:01.233
FOR HELPIN' ME OUT
IN THE SURGERY TODAY, O'MALLEY.

35:01.267 --> 35:04.167
IT WAS A-A HIGH PRESSURE
SITUATION TODAY,

35:04.200 --> 35:06.100
AND YOU WERE ON TOP OF IT.

35:06.133 --> 35:07.800
WELL, THANK YOU, DR. BURKE.

35:10.667 --> 35:14.567
AND, HEY, I'M SORRY
ABOUT BEFORE.

35:14.600 --> 35:17.767
ABOUT, YOU KNOW, BRINGIN' UP,
YOU KNOW, YOU AND CRISTINA.

35:17.800 --> 35:21.467
THAT...
IT'S JUST LIKE...

35:33.733 --> 35:35.667
YOU'RE STILL
MY GUY, O'MALLEY.

35:35.700 --> 35:38.733
YOU'RE STILL MY GUY.

35:44.633 --> 35:49.233
I ALWAYS THOUGHT I'D HOLD
YOUR HAND IN THE DELIVERY ROOM.

35:51.067 --> 35:54.067
I'LL LET YOU KNOW WHEN
THE SURGERY'S OVER, OKAY?

35:54.067 --> 35:59.467
OKAY. THIS IS
AS FAR AS I GO. MM.

36:01.667 --> 36:05.700
DR. GREY, DON'T LET 'EM
SHOW IT OFF, YOU KNOW...

36:05.733 --> 36:08.533
PUT IT IN A JAR OR PASS IT
AROUND OR NOTHIN'.

36:08.567 --> 36:10.233
YOUR TERATOMA?

36:10.267 --> 36:12.167
YEAH.

36:12.200 --> 36:15.167
I FEEL WEIRD ABOUT HAVIN'
MY INSIDES ON DISPLAY LIKE THAT.

36:15.200 --> 36:17.467
I PROMISE.

36:17.500 --> 36:20.700
AT THE END OF THE DAY,

36:20.733 --> 36:25.233
THERE ARE SOME THINGS YOU JUST
CAN'T HELP BUT TALK ABOUT.

36:29.833 --> 36:31.533
***

36:31.567 --> 36:35.200
YOU REALLY WANNA BE THE ONE
TO DISPOSE OF THIS, GREY?

36:35.233 --> 36:37.200
(Meredith)
I MADE A PROMISE.

36:41.833 --> 36:43.733
I AM WORRIED
ABOUT MY CAREER--

36:43.767 --> 36:46.767
I'M WORRIED ABOUT
MY REPUTATION AND MY--

36:57.267 --> 37:00.200
I WILL NOT BE MEREDITH GREY.
I BUSTED MY ASS TO GET HERE,

37:00.233 --> 37:02.133
AND PEOPLE WON'T
MAKE ALLOWANCES FOR ME.

37:02.167 --> 37:05.100
THIS IS NOT ABOUT MAKING
ALLOWANCES, AND YOU KNOW THAT.

37:05.133 --> 37:07.067
EVERYONE WILL KNOW.

37:07.067 --> 37:10.167
THAT'S THE POINT.
I DON'T WANT
TO TELL THE CHIEF, OKAY?

37:10.200 --> 37:12.167
I JUST...

37:12.200 --> 37:14.100
DON'T.

37:14.133 --> 37:17.667
SOME THINGS
WE JUST DON'T WANT TO HEAR...

37:17.700 --> 37:19.533
***

37:23.200 --> 37:25.100
AND SOME THINGS WE SAY

37:25.133 --> 37:28.167
BECAUSE WE CAN'T BE SILENT
ANY LONGER.

37:31.100 --> 37:33.133
I'M GETTING THE OPERATION.

37:33.167 --> 37:35.067
SHE'S CLEARLY
NOT CONSIDERING--

37:35.067 --> 37:36.667
SHE IS CONSIDERING.

37:36.700 --> 37:38.500
I'M GETTING THE OPERATION.

37:38.533 --> 37:40.433
YOU TWO TALK AND TALK,

37:40.467 --> 37:43.733
BUT HAVE YOU NOTICED
HOW YOU NEVER ASK ME ANYTHING?

37:43.767 --> 37:45.667
PART OF IT'S MY FAULT.
I LET YOU DO IT,

37:45.700 --> 37:47.600
BUT I'M NOT CHEATING ANYMORE.

37:47.633 --> 37:52.800
I'M NOT SITTING BACK AND GIVING
OVER CONTROL BECAUSE...

37:52.833 --> 37:56.367
I AM READY TO HANDLE THINGS
FOR MYSELF.

37:56.400 --> 37:58.733
SOME THINGS
ARE MORE THAN WHAT YOU SAY...

37:58.767 --> 38:00.567
THEY'RE WHAT YOU DO.

38:00.600 --> 38:02.567
I APPRECIATE YOUR CANDOR,
PRESTON.

38:02.600 --> 38:04.433
I CAN TAKE WHATEVER
YOU THREW AT SHEPHERD.

38:04.467 --> 38:06.800
I DON'T NEED ANY SPECIAL
TREATMENT HERE.

38:06.833 --> 38:08.367
AND YOU'RE NOT GONNA GET ANY.

38:08.400 --> 38:10.233
YOU'RE NOT MARRIED.
YOU'RE NOT HIDING.

38:10.267 --> 38:11.400
YOU CAME TO ME.

38:11.433 --> 38:15.500
YOU CLEARLY
VALUE YOUR RELATIONSHIP.

38:15.533 --> 38:18.333
WHAT YOU TWO
HAVE TOGETHER...

38:18.367 --> 38:22.833
I UNDERSTAND THAT, PRESTON,
AND IT DOES MATTER.

38:22.867 --> 38:26.700
SOME THINGS YOU SAY BECAUSE
THERE'S NO OTHER CHOICE.

38:26.733 --> 38:29.733
***

38:33.767 --> 38:35.667
I'VE GIVEN IT
A LOT OF CONSIDERATION,

38:35.700 --> 38:38.133
AND I'VE DECIDED
TO MOVE TO SEATTLE.

38:38.167 --> 38:42.233
MM, AND, UM, WELL, MEREDITH
WON'T BE AN ISSUE ANYMORE.

38:42.267 --> 38:47.067
SHE'S OUT OF MY LIFE. IT'S--
WELL, IT'S TAKEN CARE OF.

38:47.100 --> 38:48.833
WELL, I MUST SAY,
THIS IS, UM,

38:48.867 --> 38:52.700
REMARKABLE PROGRESS.
I APPLAUD BOTH OF YOU.

38:52.733 --> 38:57.467
YOU'VE, UM, TAKEN
A VERY SIGNIFICANT LEAP.

38:57.500 --> 39:00.367
THAT'S WHAT MARRIAGE
IS ABOUT...

39:00.400 --> 39:02.800
COMPROMISE, RIGHT?

39:02.833 --> 39:08.233
YEAH, IT'S, UH, WELL,
IT'S ABOUT, UM, GIVE AND TAKE.

39:08.267 --> 39:11.700
SOME THINGS
YOU KEEP TO YOURSELF.

39:16.833 --> 39:18.633
SHE YELLED AT YOU?

39:18.667 --> 39:22.500
OH, WE PROBABLY DESERVED IT.
WE SOLD...

39:22.533 --> 39:25.400
$485 WORTH OF TICKETS
TO THE SURGERY.

39:25.433 --> 39:28.700
YEAH.

39:28.733 --> 39:31.067
DID YOU SELL MORE?

39:34.133 --> 39:35.700
OH, YEAH.

39:35.733 --> 39:37.800
(Izzie) OUT OF CONTROL.

39:37.833 --> 39:40.067
(Meredith) HEY, JOE.
HEY.

39:40.100 --> 39:42.433
***

39:45.533 --> 39:49.067
SO YOU GUYS REALLY DON'T HAVE
ANYTHING ELSE TO TALK ABOUT.

39:49.067 --> 39:50.533
NO.
NO.

39:50.567 --> 39:52.133
NO.

39:57.167 --> 40:00.433
AND NOT TOO OFTEN...

40:00.467 --> 40:02.767
BUT EVERY NOW AND THEN...

40:02.800 --> 40:04.667
WHAT?

40:06.367 --> 40:08.333
WHAT?

40:08.367 --> 40:10.500
SOME THINGS
SIMPLY SPEAK FOR THEMSELVES.

40:10.533 --> 40:12.100
(gasps)

40:26.767 --> 40:29.800
GOOD NIGHT.

40:36.433 --> 40:39.300
SERIOUSLY.

40:39.333 --> 40:42.733
(Joe) YOU GET A DOUBLE.

40:42.767 --> 40:44.267
ALL RIGHT.
HIGH-FIVE.
