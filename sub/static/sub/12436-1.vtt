03:44.320 --> 03:45.526
Poor Jacobson.

03:47.156 --> 03:49.693
He took his stapler?
How pitiful is that?

03:49.826 --> 03:52.932
Still, you got to hand it to him...
he wen! for it.

03:53.062 --> 03:54.439
That was his big mistake.

03:54.564 --> 03:56.441
Always stay in
the middle of the pack.

03:56.566 --> 03:58.773
It's the frontrunners
who fall off the cliff.

03:58.901 --> 04:02.007
At least Jacobson made it
up on the seventh floor.

04:02.171 --> 04:04.583
It smells like cabbage on this floor.

04:04.707 --> 04:06.687
That's the smell of dead dreams.

04:06.843 --> 04:08.550
I go to the clubs at night
and people are like,

04:08.678 --> 04:10.680
"Hey, who's wearing the coleslaw?"

04:11.514 --> 04:15.018
Do you know how hard it is to get laid
when you smell like coleslaw?

04:15.118 --> 04:18.031
NO! hard, but Still.

04:18.187 --> 04:21.361
He had a pretty sweet office,
I wonder who's gonna get it?

04:21.524 --> 04:23.800
You wonder who's gonna get his office?

04:23.926 --> 04:26.532
Jesus, Josh, why don't
you show a little class?

04:26.696 --> 04:28.039
The guy just got fired.

04:32.702 --> 04:34.943
- I'm gonna get that office.
- You'd better, Tim.

04:35.271 --> 04:39.048
You need that job. With that car
you're driving and that apartment?

04:39.142 --> 04:40.052
You're overextended.

04:40.376 --> 04:42.720
These opportunities
don't come along all the time.

04:42.812 --> 04:46.316
Right now, the window's open
and if you hesitate, bam!

04:46.449 --> 04:50.056
You're gonna be my assistant.
Assistant to an assistant.

04:50.386 --> 04:53.560
You can't go lower.
It's a shitty job, Tim.

04:53.656 --> 04:55.602
Do you think Julie's
gonna marry you then?

04:57.794 --> 04:58.966
Don't mess this up.

05:00.897 --> 05:04.401
- Good pep talk.
- All right. Go, team!

05:25.588 --> 05:28.091
The whole reason we bought
the plant was to shut the factory,

05:28.424 --> 05:30.597
shed the workforce
and sell the equipment.

05:30.760 --> 05:33.934
But now, it's all contaminated
with low-level radiation.

05:34.030 --> 05:38.001
- Nobody wants to touch it.
- Americans are so uptight

05:38.334 --> 05:40.314
- about radiation.
- They are.

05:40.603 --> 05:43.948
But the Russians are a little less
particular about this sort of thing.

05:44.106 --> 05:46.108
I like it. Get two bids.
Drive up the price.

05:46.442 --> 05:49.150
- OK, that makes sense.
- On a different note, you'll notice

05:49.278 --> 05:52.953
that our colleague, Doug Jacobson,
has been relieved of his duties.

05:53.115 --> 05:58.155
Mr. Jacobson led us right to the edge,
playing around in the currency markets.

05:58.287 --> 06:00.028
As a consequence, tomorrow morning,

06:00.156 --> 06:03.137
I want ten ideas to make up
for his mistakes.

06:06.562 --> 06:09.975
- What are you doing?
- I have an idea.

06:10.733 --> 06:12.735
An analyst...

06:12.869 --> 06:16.749
- ...has an idea. OK, then.
- Nice knowing you, buddy.

06:16.873 --> 06:19.717
Sixth floor, stepping up, Nice!

06:23.713 --> 06:24.987
It's all right. it's dead.

06:25.081 --> 06:29.086
It's manufactured by Mueller Armaments,
from Zurich, Switzerland.

06:29.418 --> 06:32.160
It's a company that made
a fortune during World War I.

06:32.488 --> 06:34.161
Now they're sitting on
a bunch of bombs

06:34.323 --> 06:36.166
that even the worst armies
in the world don't want.

06:36.492 --> 06:38.096
All right, so we
cannibalize the company...

06:38.227 --> 06:39.831
,,,who's gonna buy the pieces?

06:39.996 --> 06:42.533
Oh, no, we're not gonna
strip this one down.

06:48.237 --> 06:50.547
Novelty lamps. Great idea.

06:50.673 --> 06:53.620
We could literally make
hundreds of dollars. Hundreds.

06:53.743 --> 06:58.419
- Who cares about lamps?
- Marlin Mueller does.

07:00.349 --> 07:03.523
When Martin isn't busy running his
family’s business into the ground,

07:03.686 --> 07:06.690
he's either yachting
or buying art for his castle.

07:06.856 --> 07:10.235
The business is going under,
but his personal fortune is vast.

07:10.359 --> 07:12.066
Nearly half a billion.

07:12.194 --> 07:17.041
I heard he was in town, so I sent
a prototype over to his hotel.

07:18.301 --> 07:22.374
He loved the lamps.
He wants to sit down.

07:22.972 --> 07:25.714
The lamps are really just a way
to get our foot in the door.

07:25.808 --> 07:27.048
We're gonna lose money on them.

07:27.143 --> 07:30.590
But we'll make millions
managing his personal portfolio.

07:30.713 --> 07:34.593
Mueller keeps his business.
We've got a brand-new client.

07:34.717 --> 07:39.257
- Everybody wins.
- Everybody wins. That's a new one.

07:39.388 --> 07:41.163
- Caldwell, you want to take the lead?
- Absolutely.

07:41.490 --> 07:42.491
I'll ride shotgun.

07:42.625 --> 07:44.434
Actually, I was hoping
I could take the lead.

07:48.297 --> 07:50.072
Let me think... no.

07:57.907 --> 08:00.080
You should've quit
while you were ahead, buddy.

08:01.677 --> 08:04.681
You know what they say...
tallest tree gets chopped down first.

08:04.814 --> 08:07.852
- Well, that went well.
- Mr. Conrad?

08:10.252 --> 08:12.289
Have you got a second?

08:19.996 --> 08:21.270
Come in!

08:22.498 --> 08:25.536
You can just set
your bombs by the door.

08:27.436 --> 08:31.714
You put on quite a show
in there. Sit down,

08:37.847 --> 08:39.292
Oh, that looks good on him, right?

08:39.615 --> 08:43.563
Yep. Better than it did on Jacobson.
You're gonna need a nicer watch.

08:43.686 --> 08:45.962
Nicer watch, nicer suit.

08:46.122 --> 08:48.625
Hey, to the ballsiest guy
on the sixth floor.

08:48.724 --> 08:50.635
Not gonna be on
the sixth floor for long.

08:52.495 --> 08:54.805
Does that mean
this is my new office?

08:54.964 --> 08:58.207
Not yet. No, I want to
get to know you a little better.

08:58.534 --> 09:01.208
I host a dinner once a month.

09:01.537 --> 09:04.245
- Next one's on Saturday.
- Great, OK.

09:04.573 --> 09:07.247
And it's top secret.
You can't tell anyone.

09:07.376 --> 09:10.323
What are we talking about here? Orgy?

09:10.413 --> 09:12.757
Is it a human sacrifice of some kind?

09:13.482 --> 09:16.691
We're... collectors.

09:19.221 --> 09:21.098
I'll let the guys fill you in.

09:22.858 --> 09:25.361
Some people collect
vintage automobiles.

09:25.494 --> 09:29.340
Some people collect fine wines.
Fender collects people.

09:29.665 --> 09:30.837
- People?
- Yeah.

09:31.000 --> 09:34.948
Each of us Ends a remarkable person
and invites them to dinner at Fender's.

09:35.071 --> 09:37.381
We call it the Dinner for Winners.

09:37.506 --> 09:39.679
Here's the guy that I invited last year.

09:40.242 --> 09:42.688
There you go. Look at that.

09:42.912 --> 09:46.883
The guy designed that suit.
Real-life Iron Man.

09:49.418 --> 09:52.365
- He took first prize.
- He's an idiot.

09:52.688 --> 09:54.065
You got it.

09:54.890 --> 09:58.064
You invite idiots to dinner
and make fun of them?

10:00.729 --> 10:03.141
That's,,. messed up.

10:03.265 --> 10:05.267
- I know, right?
- It's completely messed up.

10:05.601 --> 10:08.639
Al the end of the night, Fender picks
the best one, gives him a trophy

10:08.771 --> 10:10.876
and we release him out
in the wild, none the wiser.

10:10.973 --> 10:14.420
Yeah. No harm, no foul.
Hey, you're gonna do great.

10:14.543 --> 10:17.217
Just have a little subtlety
when you pick your guy.

10:17.313 --> 10:18.758
Fender's a connoisseur.

10:18.881 --> 10:21.384
Yeah. Hey, and no mimes.
It's a cliché.

10:21.717 --> 10:23.219
Jacobson brought a mime.

10:23.319 --> 10:25.799
Exactly. And you don't see
his shit here, anymore, do you?

10:50.312 --> 10:52.155
- Hey-
- Hey!

10:52.281 --> 10:53.282
Congratulations.

10:53.415 --> 10:54.951
So how did it go?
What happened today?

10:55.084 --> 10:57.257
Oh, I'll tell you later.
Look at this crowd!

10:57.419 --> 11:00.696
I know, it's amazing.
We actually sold every painting.

11:00.823 --> 11:02.928
That's incredible! Oh, my God!

11:03.092 --> 11:06.972
Except that I did another one
of my name-fiasco thingies,

11:07.096 --> 11:08.939
Oh, God, What happened?

11:09.098 --> 11:11.510
The director of
San Francisco MoMA is here.

11:11.634 --> 11:14.376
His name is Steve Doche.

11:14.503 --> 11:18.212
And I thought that it
was pronounced "Douche."

11:18.340 --> 11:21.446
God. It's like the Ron Fuchs
episode all over again.

11:21.610 --> 11:24.523
Well, it actually kind of
loosened things up, and...

11:24.647 --> 11:29.153
...and he's giving Kieran a solo show,
and he wants me to curate it.

11:29.285 --> 11:31.128
Oh, my God!

11:31.220 --> 11:34.463
You know, that is so like you!
You call a guy a douche

11:34.557 --> 11:36.298
and get your first
museum show out of it.

11:36.458 --> 11:38.802
You're amazing.
I love you so much.

11:38.961 --> 11:42.738
You're stunning and you're smart and
you're just awful with pronunciation.

11:42.865 --> 11:45.675
- Hey!
- I'm not Fuching around here.

11:46.635 --> 11:48.012
Marry me.

11:50.506 --> 11:52.247
I love you.

11:52.374 --> 11:55.014
I want to spend the rest
of my life with you.

11:56.045 --> 11:57.490
But remember when
you asked me before,

11:57.813 --> 12:03.422
and I said this is a big step, and maybe
we should just wait a little bit?

12:03.552 --> 12:04.929
Yeah?

12:05.054 --> 12:08.831
- That was two days ago.
- I know. I know.

12:08.924 --> 12:11.200
I just need a little bit of time.

12:11.327 --> 12:13.329
All right. I'll ask you in two hours.

12:14.597 --> 12:16.270
Let's go.

12:17.333 --> 12:19.404
Wow, it's packed.

12:19.535 --> 12:21.378
So, where's the artiste?

12:21.503 --> 12:24.507
I always try and create
some tension in my work.

12:24.607 --> 12:27.520
Once a reviewer said
of a certain piece of mine,

12:27.610 --> 12:29.351
may said, "i mink mars disgusting."

12:29.511 --> 12:32.515
I said, "Good! I want it
to disgust you."

12:32.681 --> 12:36.458
Sometimes I'll be working on a piece
and I'll think, "No, this is bullshit."

12:36.785 --> 12:41.461
So I will literally rub bull excrement
on the piece as a meta... metaphor.

12:41.790 --> 12:44.862
Excuse me. I'm so sorry.

12:45.027 --> 12:46.028
Julie.

12:51.300 --> 12:52.779
Kieran, you remember Tim?

12:54.370 --> 12:56.407
- The stockbroker.
- No. No.

12:56.538 --> 13:01.146
I work for a private equity firm
that specializes in distressed assets.

13:01.277 --> 13:05.987
- So kind of a stockbroker.
- Almost nothing like a stockbroker.

13:06.115 --> 13:08.152
Do you mind if I just
call you stockbroker?

13:08.284 --> 13:11.231
It's the way I remember people.
You're stockbroker Tim.

13:13.255 --> 13:15.064
Hey, so what do you think?

13:16.625 --> 13:18.571
Really... tremendous work.

13:18.727 --> 13:21.640
They're so big.
And you're in all of them.

13:22.798 --> 13:23.936
Come with me, Tim.

13:25.067 --> 13:26.137
Enjoy.

13:27.403 --> 13:29.076
I have a little ranch... I say little.

13:29.171 --> 13:30.980
It's absolutely massive
if you actually measure,

13:31.106 --> 13:35.612
outside of town, where I go to
disappear, get away from this bullshit.

13:35.744 --> 13:38.918
One of my zebras was in labor.
It was a messy business.

13:39.081 --> 13:41.994
The foal was in breech.
At about the 22nd hour,

13:42.117 --> 13:43.425
I just said, "Stuff it."

13:43.585 --> 13:47.658
And I just thrust my hand in,
turned the little guy around.

13:48.857 --> 13:50.268
Do you have any idea what it's like

13:50.426 --> 13:54.932
to be up to your elbow...
in a zebra's vagina?

13:55.097 --> 13:59.102
And feel life? New life, fresh life.

14:01.036 --> 14:04.609
- No, I don't.
- You should try it, Tim. It's magical.

14:04.940 --> 14:06.044
Yeah, I'm OK.

14:06.175 --> 14:09.679
She let me keep the afterbirth
to create this piece.

14:09.812 --> 14:13.954
Oh, wow, that's disgusting.
I don't think I get it, Kieran.

14:14.049 --> 14:17.553
Poppycock. You've been
stockbroking too long, Tim.

14:21.290 --> 14:22.894
What does it make you think of?

14:23.826 --> 14:26.238
I guess it kind of makes me...

14:26.995 --> 14:28.406
...think of your penis.

14:29.565 --> 14:30.839
Then you get it.

14:33.068 --> 14:34.513
Julie gets it.

14:37.039 --> 14:39.212
Hi, I need you to talk to a buyer.
This way.

14:40.909 --> 14:41.910
See you in a bit.

14:44.747 --> 14:49.821
Do you know what its like to have
your entire head inside its anus?

14:50.652 --> 14:52.689
Julie? Poppycock.

14:52.821 --> 14:58.271
OK, so you're just completely
immune to his animal magnetism?

14:58.394 --> 15:01.500
He looks good in a pair
of hooves. What can I say?

15:02.431 --> 15:04.411
So, are you gonna tell me
what happened today?

15:05.334 --> 15:07.109
I think I might've
gotten that promotion.

15:07.236 --> 15:10.342
Really? Oh, my God, that's amazing.

15:10.506 --> 15:12.179
- Well...
- When? When do you start?

15:12.341 --> 15:14.048
All right, well, it's not
official yet. It's not official.

15:14.176 --> 15:17.180
- There's this dinner.
- Good. When is it?

15:17.279 --> 15:20.260
- it's Saturday.
- OK. We can do that.

15:20.382 --> 15:23.420
No, it's not really
a girlfriend type thing.

15:23.552 --> 15:25.293
It's really the guys from the office.

15:25.421 --> 15:28.630
- And we have to bring a person.
- What do you mean, "a person?"

15:28.757 --> 15:33.706
A person with a skill
or a talent of some kind.

15:34.029 --> 15:36.566
Are you talking about strippers,
here? 'Cause I'm not...

15:36.698 --> 15:38.700
No, no. Nothing like that. No.

15:39.034 --> 15:43.744
We have to bring an idiot
to dinner to make fun of them.

15:45.407 --> 15:48.388
- OK, that is messed up.
- I know,

15:49.878 --> 15:52.222
- I know.
- So you told them you're not going.

15:52.881 --> 15:55.725
Oh, yeah. No, absolutely.

15:56.285 --> 15:59.732
Tell Fender I can't make the dinner.
Tell him my back thing is acting up,

15:59.888 --> 16:01.731
and I have to stay
in bed for a few days.

16:02.057 --> 16:04.401
Why don't I just tell him
you're having your period?

16:04.560 --> 16:06.733
Um, I can't stay
on this floor anymore.

16:07.062 --> 16:09.736
These people are pathetic!

16:10.065 --> 16:11.738
Happy birthday, Carol.

16:12.067 --> 16:13.637
Why can? you just suck it up,

16:13.969 --> 16:17.416
make fun of some idiots and stop
thinking about yourself for once?

16:17.573 --> 16:19.575
Susana, I know this
is painful for you,

16:19.675 --> 16:21.586
but sometimes in life
you have to do the right thing.

16:21.743 --> 16:25.919
Just lie. l!'s not that hard.
I'm texting a lie right now!

16:32.254 --> 16:33.699
Jesus Christ!

16:36.158 --> 16:37.262
Are you OK?

16:38.527 --> 16:40.700
Yeah, I'm OK.

16:41.029 --> 16:43.669
- Is that a Porsche?
- Yeah.

16:44.666 --> 16:46.543
I have been hit by a Datsun before.

16:46.668 --> 16:49.012
- Never a Porsche.
- Oh, man...

16:49.137 --> 16:52.710
- Barry Speck.
- Tim Conrad.

16:52.841 --> 16:56.379
Are you sure you're OK?
I didn't see you. What were you doing?

16:56.512 --> 16:59.789
Well, I saw this little guy in
the street, I was trying to save him.

17:01.049 --> 17:04.053
- I think it's dead.
- Yes, that's why he couldn't run away.

17:04.185 --> 17:05.665
A couple more seconds,
you would've squished him.

17:05.787 --> 17:07.164
Nice pelt, though.

17:08.223 --> 17:09.361
Ready?

17:10.858 --> 17:13.532
I hope those aren't for your lawyer.

17:14.296 --> 17:16.674
No. I would rather
not have lawyers get involved.

17:16.798 --> 17:21.838
All right, I get it.
You said you were fine, but...

17:21.970 --> 17:24.415
What would it take
to keep the lawyers out?

17:27.175 --> 17:28.313
Five.

17:30.479 --> 17:32.254
Five dollars.

17:33.181 --> 17:34.182
I don't... What do you mean?

17:34.316 --> 17:37.490
- Ten dollars.
- Seriously, what? Come on.

17:37.653 --> 17:39.030
How much do you want?

17:41.156 --> 17:43.762
- Hundred dollars.
- I don't want anything.

17:43.892 --> 17:46.168
- Five hundred dollars.
- I don'!... It's OK.

17:46.261 --> 17:48.172
- All right...
- As long as you're OK, then...

17:50.365 --> 17:52.208
Ten thousand!

17:54.069 --> 17:56.345
OK, I'll take ten thousand dollars.

18:01.510 --> 18:03.512
I don't have ten thousand dollars.

18:05.347 --> 18:07.418
You know what? Don't worry about it.

18:08.884 --> 18:12.627
- Really?
- Yeah. As long as you're OK.

18:12.754 --> 18:14.859
- You're a good person.
- No... It's all right.

18:14.957 --> 18:17.699
- Get out of the road!
- You are. You're a good person.

18:17.859 --> 18:19.361
- Thank you.
- No, you really are.

18:19.461 --> 18:22.135
- You're a really nice person.
- All right, well, as long as you're OK,

18:22.264 --> 18:23.436
- that's OK.
- Thanks. Thank you.

18:23.565 --> 18:26.478
Yeah. You take care.

18:27.369 --> 18:29.542
I won't forget this.

18:29.705 --> 18:33.152
- You dropped your...
- Oh, yeah. That's my latest series.

18:33.275 --> 18:37.280
I know. Mouseterpieces. Get it?

18:38.313 --> 18:41.157
- That's the Mona Lisa.
- That's the Mouse-a-Lisa.

18:42.417 --> 18:44.658
- Mouse-a-Lisa...
- There they are.

18:44.786 --> 18:50.065
Found her on the 405. From here down,
she was a mess, but the head, perfect.

18:50.993 --> 18:53.803
Oh, that's Cubism,
Not as easy as it looks.

18:53.929 --> 18:55.408
Well, it doesn't look easy.

18:56.898 --> 18:59.139
I like her. I love the tail.

19:00.669 --> 19:04.981
- Check that out. You like them?
- I'm speechless.

19:05.974 --> 19:07.078
So is he.

19:08.176 --> 19:10.417
'Cause he's screaming.

19:10.512 --> 19:14.517
I was just stopping by the store today
to get some pelt wax and spine wire.

19:14.683 --> 19:17.687
Wanted to ill the guys in
on what I've been up to,

19:17.819 --> 19:20.857
Hey, you know what? I have some
in the flesh. Want to see 'em?

19:20.989 --> 19:23.970
Where did they...?
Come here! Come here!

19:26.094 --> 19:28.973
Hold on, hold on, hold on. Don't look!

19:29.865 --> 19:33.438
- OK... All right...
- Can I look?

19:33.535 --> 19:35.446
Hold on, hold on, hold on...

19:37.272 --> 19:38.478
Go ahead.

19:43.645 --> 19:44.783
Incredible.

19:47.315 --> 19:49.295
Does that guy look sort of familiar?

19:50.118 --> 19:52.997
I'll give you a hint.
He wrote the Bible.

19:54.356 --> 19:55.630
- ls it Jesus?
- Yes!

19:55.724 --> 19:57.965
- You know your stuff!
- Amazing.

19:58.293 --> 20:01.797
Yeah. Well, it's a hobby.
I like to think that...

20:01.897 --> 20:04.571
...I'm sort of giving them
a second chance, you know?

20:04.700 --> 20:09.308
In the words of John Lennon, "You
may say I'm a dreamer, but I'm not."

20:11.540 --> 20:14.521
- "The only one."
- The only what?

20:14.643 --> 20:18.352
No, that's the lyric. "You may say I'm
a dreamer, but I'm not the only one."

20:20.215 --> 20:21.489
OK, Tim.

20:24.019 --> 20:25.999
You know, Barry, this was
a very strange way to meet,

20:26.321 --> 20:28.665
but I think everything
happens for a reason.

20:28.924 --> 20:29.994
Did you make that up?

20:30.659 --> 20:31.831
Yeah.

20:31.927 --> 20:36.899
"Everything happens
for a reason." I like that.

20:37.232 --> 20:40.702
Thanks. Anyway, tomorrow night,
I'm having dinner with some friends.

20:40.836 --> 20:44.841
Are you? That's incredible.
Congratulations.

20:44.940 --> 20:47.420
I was wondering,
would you like to join us?

20:47.843 --> 20:49.447
- You shitting me?
- No.

20:51.012 --> 20:53.253
Say that your girlfriend
thinks meat is murder,

20:53.381 --> 20:55.361
and she convinces
you to become a vegetarian.

20:55.450 --> 20:59.523
Then one day, you're grilling up
a veggie burger, and all of a sudden,

20:59.621 --> 21:03.467
a chicken comes up, plucks itself,
covers itself in barbecue sauce

21:03.592 --> 21:05.037
and flings itself on the grill.

21:05.360 --> 21:06.964
That's God sending a message, right?

21:07.295 --> 21:09.741
Yeah, that chicken wants to die.

21:09.865 --> 21:13.711
No. God wants us
to move to the seventh floor.

21:13.802 --> 21:15.941
And He sent His only son to tell me.

21:17.472 --> 21:20.385
Come with me, my children,
to the seventh floor,

21:24.746 --> 21:28.717
Tim! I'd like you to meet
Mr. and Mrs. Mueller

21:29.818 --> 21:32.059
Of course! What a pleasure
it is to meet you.

21:32.387 --> 21:34.594
Mr. Conrad!
You sent the lamp to my hotel.

21:34.723 --> 21:36.498
- That's... yeah!
- I wished to meet you in person.

21:36.625 --> 21:40.004
Yes, Tim was really helpful when
we came up with the idea for the lamps.

21:40.128 --> 21:42.074
And we'd been discussing
personal investment as well.

21:42.397 --> 21:45.139
That's a conversation I'm very much
looking forward to getting back to.

21:45.267 --> 21:47.247
- Well, I'm glad we could do this.
- Yeah.

21:49.337 --> 21:52.944
Congratulations on your
new Matisse. It's beautiful.

21:54.676 --> 21:58.089
My wife is a true collector.
It was quite a bidding war.

21:58.413 --> 22:01.019
Well, to the victor go the spoils.

22:01.349 --> 22:03.920
You know my family crest.

22:04.085 --> 22:06.031
Our motto continues to inspire.

22:06.354 --> 22:10.097
- Ad Victorem Spolias.
- Fantastic.

22:12.027 --> 22:14.132
- Well, shall we?
- Yeah.

22:16.665 --> 22:18.008
Join us.

22:23.205 --> 22:26.482
So you follow the art world,
Mr. Conrad?

22:26.608 --> 22:30.715
I try to. My girlfriend runs
The Cronin Gallery downtown.

22:30.846 --> 22:34.123
I would love to meet her.
We must have brunch tomorrow.

22:34.449 --> 22:37.555
They can speak about beauty.
We can speak about business.

22:38.286 --> 22:39.560
Sounds perfect.

22:39.688 --> 22:42.134
I'll have my assistant
make the arrangements.

22:51.466 --> 22:54.037
OK, what the hell just happened?
This guys supposed to be my client.

22:54.169 --> 22:56.979
- You're still just an analyst...
- No, no, this is better.

22:57.072 --> 22:59.052
I didn't know it was
going to be a double date.

22:59.374 --> 23:02.321
Tim's the only one here who
isn't divorced or dating a hooker.

23:04.346 --> 23:09.523
This guy wants to invest $100 million.
Don't mess it up. We need this.

23:11.753 --> 23:14.324
Well, the sixth floor steps up.

23:15.490 --> 23:16.525
- Excuse me.
- Yeah.

23:16.658 --> 23:20.834
Hey, rooting for you, buddy, Good luck.

23:22.998 --> 23:26.172
- My girlfriend's not a hooker.
- She tried to give me a BJ.

23:26.334 --> 23:28.905
If she didn't ask for money,
then she's not a hooker, is she?

23:29.037 --> 23:32.678
She asked me for money.
It wasn't that expensive, either.

23:32.841 --> 23:35.788
I still had a ton of singles left over
from your sister's birthday party.

23:35.911 --> 23:38.118
Hey, is Cinnamon a family name?

23:44.619 --> 23:46.428
- Hey, honey.
- Hey!

23:46.554 --> 23:50.024
Glad you're still here. Look,
don't make plans tomorrow morning.

23:50.125 --> 23:51.536
Why?

23:53.895 --> 23:56.535
How'd you like to have brunch
with a fascinating Swiss couple?

23:56.698 --> 23:58.700
- OK.
- She's an art collector

23:58.867 --> 24:00.244
and he's got a lot of money.

24:00.368 --> 24:03.872
- I need you. This is huge.
- it's huge?

24:04.739 --> 24:06.719
- Really huge.
- What's this?

24:11.713 --> 24:13.056
What is this?

24:15.617 --> 24:17.221
That's a...

24:17.552 --> 24:19.793
It's a mouse dressed like Jesus.

24:21.222 --> 24:23.463
This guy that I ran into today,
he makes them.

24:23.591 --> 24:27.061
He's amazing.
He's some kind of artisan.

24:27.162 --> 24:30.632
Really? Are you doing that dinner?

24:31.232 --> 24:32.233
No.

24:36.171 --> 24:38.742
- Hey, come on.
- No, not when you're lying to me.

24:39.507 --> 24:41.680
- Julie, Fender invited me.
- So?

24:41.810 --> 24:44.848
Fender, as in Fender Financial?

24:44.980 --> 24:47.586
The you I know
would have just said no.

24:47.749 --> 24:50.525
The me that you know did say no.

24:50.652 --> 24:53.030
But the me that you don't know
had to say yes.

24:53.154 --> 24:55.259
- The you I don't know?
- Yes.

24:55.590 --> 24:57.695
Look, there's you
and the me that you know.

24:57.826 --> 25:00.534
And we love each other
and we have a wonderful life.

25:00.662 --> 25:02.608
But then there's the me
that you don't know.

25:02.764 --> 25:06.211
And the me that you don't know
has to do things sometimes so that you

25:06.534 --> 25:09.037
and the me that you know
can live in this nice apartment,

25:09.170 --> 25:11.878
and eat at nice restaurants
and go to Cabo for Christmas.

25:12.007 --> 25:13.884
- He takes care of us.
- You know what?

25:14.009 --> 25:16.114
There should not be
any you I don't know.

25:16.211 --> 25:18.282
But there is.
You might not like him.

25:18.380 --> 25:20.951
I don't like him.
I hate him! But we need him.

25:21.049 --> 25:23.962
- You know? It's like the CIA.
- The CIA?

25:24.119 --> 25:27.157
The CIA does some pretty funky,
nasty stuff in the shadows,

25:27.288 --> 25:28.961
but I, for one, am glad they're there.

25:29.057 --> 25:31.196
The CIA doesn't invite people to dinner

25:31.326 --> 25:35.365
- to make fun of them.
- No. The CIA kills people.

25:35.497 --> 25:38.376
And I'm getting raked over the coals
because of a little dinner.

25:38.500 --> 25:39.911
Can I just ask you something?

25:40.035 --> 25:43.744
Is there any you I don't know
who isn't completely full of shit?

25:43.872 --> 25:47.012
I'd love to talk to him right now.

25:48.343 --> 25:49.913
Julie, come on. Julie!

25:51.913 --> 25:55.326
Julie! Julie, where are you going?

25:55.650 --> 25:58.187
I... I have to go meet Kieran
and talk about San Francisco.

25:58.319 --> 26:01.198
Julie, please come out of the elevator.
All right? I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

26:01.322 --> 26:03.165
I'll call him,
I'll tell him the dinner's off.

26:03.258 --> 26:06.102
- I want to believe you.
- You can believe me.

26:06.227 --> 26:07.831
I'll never see that guy in my life.

26:07.929 --> 26:10.102
- Yeah.
- I promise.

26:10.999 --> 26:13.673
Oh, my,,, Let's talk later.

26:13.835 --> 26:14.836
- In a few hours.
- What?

26:14.936 --> 26:15.937
I think we need to cool off.

26:16.071 --> 26:18.381
- Gosh, I hate when that happens.
- We'll talk in a bit, OK?

26:18.506 --> 26:20.884
- Just give ourselves a moment...
- I gotta go to work.

26:21.009 --> 26:22.784
I feel like I'm in The Shining.

26:27.682 --> 26:29.218
You are welcome.

26:29.350 --> 26:32.263
Oh, God. My back, my back, my back.

26:32.387 --> 26:34.196
Is it your back?

26:34.789 --> 26:35.961
What the hell are you doing here?

26:36.091 --> 26:37.365
Well, I went to the address you gave me.

26:37.525 --> 26:41.029
Nobody was there.
Are we having this dinner or not?

26:43.198 --> 26:44.973
OK, just... slow.

26:47.035 --> 26:48.605
Au right.

26:51.973 --> 26:54.317
- What are you doing?
- I'm applying heat.

26:54.976 --> 26:56.717
Barry, please stop doing that.

27:01.716 --> 27:03.218
- I'm gonna ix your back.
- Barry, stop!

27:03.318 --> 27:04.319
I am a trained taxidermist.

27:04.652 --> 27:07.895
- And I am alive.
- You are tight.

27:08.389 --> 27:10.630
- Oh, God!
- OK...

27:11.326 --> 27:12.304
Look at that face!

27:12.627 --> 27:14.834
- Stop it!
- OK, all right.

27:16.397 --> 27:19.970
- I hope this doesn't mess up dinner.
- We're not having dinner tonight.

27:20.101 --> 27:22.911
- it's tomorrow,
- I don'! think so, Tim.

27:23.071 --> 27:26.609
Barry, I made the plans.
I know when it is.

27:28.076 --> 27:30.249
- I'm pretty sure it's tonight.
- it's not tonight.

27:30.345 --> 27:33.758
OK. All right.
I guess one of us got confused.

27:38.586 --> 27:40.964
Great. She left her phone here.

27:41.656 --> 27:44.466
You know what they say,
everything happens for a reason.

27:45.593 --> 27:46.663
YOU Said That.

27:47.495 --> 27:49.304
You know what, Barry?

27:49.430 --> 27:52.707
I am really, really looking forward
to our dinner tomorrow night.

27:52.834 --> 27:56.976
But, right now,
I'd appreciate it if you just left.

27:57.105 --> 28:01.281
And the reason is...'?

28:01.442 --> 28:02.887
Because I got
in a right with my girlfriend,

28:03.011 --> 28:07.050
and because I'd like to be here
alone when she comes back, OK?

28:07.882 --> 28:11.830
- What if she doesn't come back?
- She's coming back.

28:15.723 --> 28:17.999
Hey, we are gonna
get through this together.

28:18.126 --> 28:21.073
I think I know someone
who might make you feel better.

28:25.166 --> 28:28.409
Remember this guy
from the street? This is you.

28:29.571 --> 28:31.744
Barry, that was a dead mouse
in the road

28:31.873 --> 28:33.978
a couple of hours ago.
Please get it away from my face.

28:34.142 --> 28:37.385
It's like looking in a mirror, isn't it?
You feel better?

28:37.512 --> 28:39.822
- it's amazing.
- Are you cheered up?

28:39.981 --> 28:43.485
Barry, I have a back brace
in my bedroom.

28:43.651 --> 28:46.495
If you could just help me
get off this couch...

28:46.821 --> 28:47.822
Sure.

28:47.922 --> 28:50.266
I wan! to do this
very slowly and carefully.

28:51.326 --> 28:52.327
On the count of...

28:52.493 --> 28:53.494
Three!

28:58.066 --> 28:59.909
- All you.
- All right.

29:07.041 --> 29:08.918
Now, I... If I could just...

29:12.046 --> 29:13.582
You can do it. You got it!

29:13.715 --> 29:16.855
Oh, yeah! Yeah, Tim!

29:16.951 --> 29:19.431
- You got this! I'll help!
- No, no, no! I have it.

29:19.754 --> 29:21.700
- All right.
- I'm good.

29:23.958 --> 29:25.801
Tim, you look good!

30:33.027 --> 30:34.097
What are you doing?

30:36.431 --> 30:38.342
- What are you doing?
- Computer,

30:39.834 --> 30:42.212
Oh, my God!
You gave her my address?!

30:42.337 --> 30:47.548
- She's very concerned about you.
- Barry, this woman is a nightmare.

30:47.875 --> 30:50.481
She's been stalking me
for three years!

30:50.611 --> 30:53.114
I slept with her one night,
biggest mistake of my life.

30:53.281 --> 30:56.626
- It was before I even met Julie.
- Why did you do that?

30:56.951 --> 30:58.624
Because it was New Years
and I was drunk

30:58.720 --> 31:00.324
and she was wearing
these fishnet stockings.

31:00.455 --> 31:02.628
You want me to
tell her not to come?

31:05.460 --> 31:07.633
Go. Go.

31:07.795 --> 31:09.968
Come to dinner tomorrow
and that's it. Let's go. Move!

31:10.131 --> 31:12.168
Come on! Go, go!

31:13.634 --> 31:17.480
- Oh, my God, what have you done?
- I'm gonna make it up to you.

31:47.335 --> 31:50.077
OK! OK!

31:50.505 --> 31:53.782
Well, well, well.
If it isn't little miss panty bottom.

31:54.742 --> 31:57.018
- I'm sorry, who are you?
- I am a friend of Tim's.

31:57.178 --> 31:59.590
- Yeah, I don't know you.
- Oh, you don't?

31:59.914 --> 32:01.359
So you know everything about Tim?

32:01.516 --> 32:05.089
You are the world's greatest
expert on all things Tim?

32:06.621 --> 32:08.396
Did Tim invite you
to a dinner tomorrow night?

32:08.523 --> 32:10.628
According to him,
it is tomorrow night, yes.

32:10.758 --> 32:14.069
Right. You want my advice?

32:14.929 --> 32:18.206
- Don't go.
- OK, may I give you some advice, too?

32:18.299 --> 32:21.246
Do not wear fishnets on New Year's Eve.

32:21.369 --> 32:25.647
It's too cold. When the wind blows,
you gotta go with the hose.

32:25.773 --> 32:29.050
- You know what? I really need to...
- Now, Darla, Darla, come on,,,

32:29.143 --> 32:31.384
- Darla?
- Yes. He told me all about you.

32:31.479 --> 32:34.392
Really? What did Tim tell you about me?

32:35.883 --> 32:37.556
Told me about the sex.

32:38.820 --> 32:39.890
The Sex?

32:40.888 --> 32:44.665
The dirty, dirty sex. But he lives
with a woman named Julie,

32:44.792 --> 32:46.794
and if she comes home
and Ends you, that, that...

32:46.928 --> 32:48.771
You can imagine how she would feel.

32:48.896 --> 32:51.740
Yeah, I imagine
she'd be pretty pissed off.

32:52.066 --> 32:53.636
I gotta nip this in the bud.

32:53.968 --> 32:57.142
- You gotta move along.
- You tell your friend, Tim, he can...

32:57.271 --> 32:59.012
You tell him he can kiss my ass.

32:59.574 --> 33:01.247
Don't have to. We have a picture.

33:04.245 --> 33:09.024
Problem solved. l intercepted
your stalker in the hallway.

33:09.150 --> 33:12.154
Darla showed up?
And you got her to leave?

33:12.286 --> 33:15.665
Oh, I don't think you're
ever gonna see her again.

33:19.527 --> 33:23.532
- Who is that?
- Kieran Vollard. He's an artist.

33:23.664 --> 33:27.271
Very attractive man. He can it
a whole octopus in his mouth.

33:27.368 --> 33:29.541
Sort of an animal magnetism
about him.

33:29.670 --> 33:31.172
That's what Julie says.

33:32.173 --> 33:35.643
"For Julie.
Thanks for everything. Kieran."

33:36.711 --> 33:40.056
- Everything?
- Yeah, she curated his show.

33:41.682 --> 33:42.786
Bet that's not all she curated.

33:43.117 --> 33:45.324
I don't know what that means, Barry.

33:45.453 --> 33:48.024
Well, I don't know
what curated means.

33:48.155 --> 33:49.156
Where is she?

33:51.459 --> 33:53.302
Working.

33:54.228 --> 33:56.174
Probably with Kieran.

33:56.297 --> 33:59.335
Where? In his bed?

33:59.467 --> 34:02.812
I seriously doubt
they're working in his bed.

34:02.904 --> 34:05.510
Well, if they're not working,
why are they in his bed?

34:06.507 --> 34:09.420
Tim, you need to call Kieran's house
and see if she's there.

34:09.543 --> 34:10.716
I'm not doing that.

34:10.844 --> 34:12.380
It's the only way you're
gonna know for sure.

34:12.513 --> 34:14.150
- I'm not calling.
- I'm telling you...

34:14.248 --> 34:17.821
No, I'm not gonna call Kieran
and say I don't know where Julie is.

34:17.985 --> 34:19.396
- Do it. Do it.
- No. No.

34:19.520 --> 34:20.521
All right, I will.

34:20.655 --> 34:23.101
What reason could you possibly
have for calling him?

34:23.224 --> 34:25.704
I want to make
a movie about his life.

34:25.826 --> 34:28.670
I want to make a documentary.
I gain his confidence,

34:28.829 --> 34:31.503
and then he starts feeling more
relaxed about talking to me.

34:31.666 --> 34:33.509
He's really opening up to me.

34:33.668 --> 34:35.841
We're talking about his
sex life and then...

34:35.937 --> 34:39.578
...Julie's name pops up
and we've got it on tape!

34:39.706 --> 34:41.618
- Yeah.
- He's been curated!

34:42.176 --> 34:44.713
Well, that sounds like
a bullet-proof plan.

34:44.844 --> 34:46.847
What's his number?

34:47.014 --> 34:50.427
-One-1-1...1-1...
- Hold on.

34:51.185 --> 34:52.186
OK. Go.

34:52.353 --> 34:53.855
- One-1 -1
- Got that.

34:54.188 --> 34:55.632
One-1

34:55.755 --> 34:57.463
- One-1.
- OK.

35:03.898 --> 35:06.276
He must've changed his number.
I'm just getting a weird sound.

35:07.101 --> 35:08.478
Oh, well. We tried.

35:10.271 --> 35:12.273
There he is. Kieran Vollard. I got him.

35:12.707 --> 35:14.209
Don'!! Don't!

35:15.076 --> 35:17.818
- I'm serious. Don't call him.
- it's ringing...

35:17.945 --> 35:19.322
Hang up the phone.

35:19.447 --> 35:20.926
Hang up the phone!

35:21.048 --> 35:22.755
I'm gonna do an accent.

35:22.883 --> 35:24.885
Don't do an accent.
Hang up the phone.

35:25.052 --> 35:28.625
- Hello?
- Hello! How are you?

35:28.756 --> 35:30.599
This is Nigel!

35:30.725 --> 35:33.433
I'm a documentary filmmaker

35:33.561 --> 35:35.939
-from London, England.
- Hang up!

35:36.063 --> 35:38.839
May I speak to Kieran Vollard, please?

35:38.966 --> 35:41.572
- This is Kieran.
- Kieran.

35:41.669 --> 35:45.310
I want to make a documentary
about your life.

35:46.307 --> 35:50.153
Start the water i'll be right in.
Yeah, I could do an Interview.

35:50.277 --> 35:54.191
Smashing! Champagne wishes
and caviar dreams!

35:54.315 --> 35:56.522
I will have my man-servant
Contact you with the details.

35:56.651 --> 35:58.597
That sounded like Julie's laugh.

36:00.187 --> 36:01.757
She might've been there!

36:01.856 --> 36:04.427
- I'm going over there.
- No, Tim!

36:05.426 --> 36:07.599
You can't drive in this condition.

36:08.996 --> 36:11.476
Clutch! Oh, God, use the clu...

36:11.599 --> 36:13.943
You can't just shift.
You need to use the clutch, Barry.

36:14.268 --> 36:15.440
Oh, God.

36:18.939 --> 36:21.681
OK, hold on. I'll get it.

36:26.947 --> 36:27.948
No, no, no, no...

36:28.115 --> 36:29.458
- OK.
- I got it.

36:37.625 --> 36:39.161
She's gotta be in there.

36:40.194 --> 36:42.003
Just need to get her attention.

36:46.967 --> 36:49.140
Those were my car keys, weren't they?

37:01.148 --> 37:02.684
Oh, God.

37:07.822 --> 37:09.824
Here we go. Let's do this thing.

37:09.924 --> 37:13.736
Barry! Barry, just...
Just get the keys and come back!

37:14.695 --> 37:16.174
Barry!

37:21.035 --> 37:22.514
I am inside the apartment.

37:22.603 --> 37:25.777
I know. I want you out of the apartment.
Get the keys and let's get out of here!

37:25.906 --> 37:28.614
Oh, Tim, I wish you could
see this place! It's amazing!

37:28.743 --> 37:30.620
I thought you had
a great apartment.. This...

37:30.745 --> 37:34.784
This, my friend... Oh, my God!

37:37.685 --> 37:40.063
He's friends with Morgan Freeman.

37:40.955 --> 37:42.696
Please get the hell out of there.

37:47.027 --> 37:48.097
He's coming!

38:27.902 --> 38:31.145
- Cat got the Tim mouse!
- Forget about the mouse! Come on!

38:32.173 --> 38:33.914
Get the keys and get out of there!

38:34.074 --> 38:35.246
Forget the mouse!

38:47.087 --> 38:49.931
Thank you. Hey! He's OK!

38:50.991 --> 38:52.265
Hide! Hide!

39:07.441 --> 39:09.512
Kieran, I'm ready.

39:13.013 --> 39:14.651
Barry!

39:15.282 --> 39:16.454
Barry!

39:20.387 --> 39:21.388
Julie's here.

39:26.527 --> 39:27.904
Oh, yes..

39:28.662 --> 39:30.664
Sounds like they're having intercourse.

39:30.798 --> 39:33.404
That's it. Oh, fantastic.

39:38.572 --> 39:40.813
I'm having trouble describing
what I'm looking at.

39:40.975 --> 39:43.216
Fly, fly...

39:46.313 --> 39:48.850
Yes! Primordial...

39:57.157 --> 39:58.192
Hello.

39:59.426 --> 40:00.427
Who are you?

40:00.995 --> 40:01.996
I'm...

40:03.097 --> 40:05.168
Monique, Christina, this is Tim.

40:05.499 --> 40:07.103
He's a stockbroker,
or something like that.

40:07.434 --> 40:10.904
- Tim, can I help you?
- No, no, no. Sorry, I...

40:11.038 --> 40:12.176
I'm Nigel Nigel!

40:12.506 --> 40:16.010
- I'm here doing a documentary!
- You can stop that now, Barry.

40:16.176 --> 40:20.852
My name's not Barry! So, what
have you done with Julie?

40:21.015 --> 40:23.757
Tim... has Julie left you?

40:24.618 --> 40:29.089
Oh, Tim. I was always very
attracted to Julie and I still am.

40:29.790 --> 40:32.031
You must be broken.
She's a wonderful creature.

40:32.192 --> 40:33.193
Stop...

40:33.360 --> 40:35.203
I have to say, though, Tim,
I'm not surprised.

40:35.529 --> 40:37.531
- Really?
- There's not a lot of monogamy

40:37.698 --> 40:41.703
in the animal kingdom. Not many
animals mate for life. Penguins do.

40:41.802 --> 40:44.214
I've spent a lot of time with penguins,
and they're really cool.

40:44.371 --> 40:47.784
And maybe you're a penguin, Tim,
but Julie's not a penguin.

40:47.908 --> 40:52.050
She's a lioness. Don't try
to mate a lioness with a penguin.

40:52.212 --> 40:57.252
Ever. Have you ever seen
a mammal and a bird mate?

40:57.384 --> 40:59.159
I've never even heard of that.

40:59.286 --> 41:02.756
Is that right?
You gonna try and tame her?

41:02.890 --> 41:08.101
- 'Cause I don't think you're her type.
- Maybe. But I have something.

41:08.228 --> 41:10.230
Something that women respond to.

41:10.564 --> 41:13.738
That's true. Julie and I
have been saying that.

41:13.901 --> 41:17.906
- Tim doesn't get it.
- He's right. Listen to your friend.

41:18.005 --> 41:20.952
Am I gonna make love with
Christina and Monique tonight?

41:21.075 --> 41:24.249
Yeah! Hell, yes! Guilty.
You caught me out. Yeah.

41:24.411 --> 41:26.584
But only because
it's part of my process.

41:26.680 --> 41:28.250
Your "process"?

41:28.582 --> 41:30.152
There are two things in this world:

41:30.484 --> 41:36.127
Wonderful, visceral, sexy sex...

41:36.256 --> 41:37.667
...and death.

41:39.760 --> 41:41.967
Horrible, boring death.

41:43.297 --> 41:47.268
Now, I'm gonna go off and have some
sex with these girls before I die.

41:47.368 --> 41:48.711
Go ahead.

41:48.836 --> 41:51.043
If you guys wanna join, that's cool.

41:51.171 --> 41:53.276
But don't look at me in the eye.
It puts me off.

41:53.374 --> 41:56.150
- What?
- OK, you're not into it. That's cool.

41:56.276 --> 41:59.553
Good to see ya, Tim,
Thanks for visiting. Great to meet you.

42:03.617 --> 42:05.460
I wanna grow a beard.

42:07.688 --> 42:10.032
I know you're set on a
documentary, but hear me out...

42:10.157 --> 42:14.333
Charlize Theron plays Julie.
Kieran plays himself.

42:14.461 --> 42:16.634
I don't know.
It is something to think about.

42:16.797 --> 42:18.140
Three, two, one...

42:21.702 --> 42:22.976
Oh, my God.

42:23.070 --> 42:26.313
Oh, my God!
How did you do that?

42:27.841 --> 42:31.152
A human back and a rodent back
are eerily similar.

42:32.713 --> 42:34.317
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

42:34.415 --> 42:35.416
Now, go.

42:36.350 --> 42:40.492
- What about dinner?
- It's tomorrow, Barry. Tomorrow.

42:41.989 --> 42:43.900
That's interesting.

42:44.024 --> 42:47.028
You say you're over Darla and yet you
have a picture of her in your apartment.

42:47.161 --> 42:48.765
How does Julie feel about that?

42:52.066 --> 42:53.545
That is Julie.

42:57.438 --> 43:00.282
Barry, is that the woman
you talked to in the hallway?

43:03.510 --> 43:04.921
Well...

43:05.879 --> 43:07.415
Well...

43:08.182 --> 43:10.184
She has the same face.

43:12.719 --> 43:14.528
I'll get the door.

43:16.790 --> 43:17.791
Where's Tim?

43:21.361 --> 43:24.706
- Oh, God.
- Well, well.

43:25.966 --> 43:29.971
You blew it with Julie.
Just like you blew it with me.

43:30.104 --> 43:34.712
Poor little Timmy.
You missed your chance.

43:34.875 --> 43:37.048
And you'll never have me again.

43:37.144 --> 43:40.387
- Let's go.
- You're hurting me.

43:40.481 --> 43:43.951
- I'm not," Stop it.
- Please, stop hurting me.

43:44.084 --> 43:47.930
- I'm not even touching you.
- Why do we keep doing this?

43:49.256 --> 43:51.930
You know, some day,
I'm really gonna leave you.

43:57.998 --> 44:00.308
All right, go, go!
Get out of my house, right now!

44:02.736 --> 44:04.443
You're very cruel, Tim.

44:05.072 --> 44:07.916
- Hello.
- Who's your friend?

44:08.075 --> 44:09.611
Barry, his name's Barry.

44:11.178 --> 44:13.454
Wanna watch while I screw
Barry's brains out?

44:13.580 --> 44:17.255
- I can honestly say no to that one.
- Oh, really?

44:18.252 --> 44:20.163
So, do you guys wanna get pizza?

44:22.923 --> 44:25.096
Wanna lick cheese
off my naked body?

44:25.259 --> 44:26.829
I'm sure Tim has plates.

44:27.261 --> 44:28.262
Hello?

44:28.362 --> 44:30.774
Hey, who's Darla?
I just met your friend earlier

44:30.864 --> 44:32.309
He told me some pretty
interesting things

44:32.432 --> 44:34.469
- about this woman.
- What did he saw

44:34.601 --> 44:38.447
- Oh, I don't know. He spoke about...
- Oh, wow, you're like a friendly dog.

44:38.772 --> 44:40.877
- ...talked about sex...
- What?

44:41.008 --> 44:42.351
What exactly did he say?

44:42.476 --> 44:44.387
Can you just tell me?
Are you cheating on me?

44:44.711 --> 44:46.782
It's not a difficult
question to answer!

44:46.880 --> 44:50.521
- Hello? Are you cheating on me?
- She put it in her pants.

44:50.651 --> 44:52.790
Tim! I don't know why it's
so hard for you to answer..

44:52.953 --> 44:54.899
Julie! You're crazy to think
that I'm cheating on you!

44:55.022 --> 44:58.003
That's insane!
Where are you? Where are you?

44:58.125 --> 45:00.696
- Julie!
- I think I hung up.

45:01.695 --> 45:02.696
You have no right!

45:03.564 --> 45:05.908
No right? Barry, we're gonna be a while.

45:06.033 --> 45:07.478
- You're a crazy person.
- All right, I'll be here.

45:07.801 --> 45:11.476
Hey, Tim? Tim?

45:11.805 --> 45:13.978
- Tim?
- Oh, God...

45:14.141 --> 45:17.020
Tim? Timmy Tim?

45:17.144 --> 45:19.556
What do you say?
Should we drive him crazy?

45:20.147 --> 45:21.820
OK!

45:21.915 --> 45:25.089
I'm a naughty little schoolgirl!

45:25.219 --> 45:26.994
You look a little old
to be a schoolgirl.

45:27.087 --> 45:29.192
I need to be punished.

45:29.323 --> 45:31.530
Hey, Naomi, how you doing? It's Tim.

45:31.658 --> 45:33.763
I'm wondering if
you've heard from Julie.

45:33.894 --> 45:36.204
Don't you wanna be my schoolteacher?

45:36.330 --> 45:38.401
I'm really not qualified.
I work for the IRS.

45:38.532 --> 45:40.443
- No, no, no...
- Not tonight.

45:40.767 --> 45:43.270
- No, all the time. I work...
- OK, OK.

45:43.403 --> 45:47.874
You work for the IRS,
and I have been very...

45:48.008 --> 45:51.387
- ...very bad.
- Have you heard from Julie?

45:51.511 --> 45:53.115
- I haven't paid my taxes...
- No?

45:53.247 --> 45:56.524
...and I need to be spanked! Now!

45:56.850 --> 45:58.523
Well, that's really
not the way it works.

45:58.619 --> 46:01.259
You probably just have to pay
the difference, plus interest.

46:01.388 --> 46:03.026
OK, I...

46:03.123 --> 46:05.433
- I need you to spank me real hard.
- I'm looking for Julie.

46:05.759 --> 46:08.205
Spank me hard, Barry!

46:08.295 --> 46:10.366
- Barry!
- No, no. That's the TV.

46:13.600 --> 46:15.876
Oh, yeah! Oh, Barry!

46:16.036 --> 46:18.573
Yeah! Oh, Barry!

46:24.044 --> 46:26.081
Oh, Barry!

46:26.213 --> 46:29.456
If she gets in touch with you, please
tell her to call me. It's an emergency.

46:29.783 --> 46:32.491
You're like some
crazy animal all over...

46:32.819 --> 46:35.561
- I wanna be a penguin!
- I like to eat penguins.

46:35.889 --> 46:37.493
Hope you don't catch me.
Penguins are very slow.

46:37.824 --> 46:39.394
Except I'm Turbo Penguin!

46:40.994 --> 46:43.440
Come here... I'm gonna catch you...

46:45.799 --> 46:46.937
Did you hurt your knee?

46:47.067 --> 46:50.640
Barry, that's funny,
You are a bad little penguin.

46:52.639 --> 46:53.640
Don't get me!

46:55.342 --> 46:56.480
Come here!

47:05.652 --> 47:09.327
- You're gonna die.
- No, I'm not.

47:13.760 --> 47:14.761
Oh, God.

47:25.439 --> 47:26.440
God!

47:35.849 --> 47:36.850
Barry?

47:38.285 --> 47:41.232
Tim? Call me! OK?

47:41.355 --> 47:44.632
This was so much fun! I love you!

47:44.791 --> 47:48.295
Foreever! And ever...

47:56.970 --> 47:59.917
Barry! Barry.

48:05.178 --> 48:07.488
Works every time.

48:07.647 --> 48:11.390
If you are attacked,
you should always play dead.

48:11.518 --> 48:13.555
People don't want to punch
something that's dead.

48:13.887 --> 48:15.264
- it's instinctual.
- She's gone?

48:15.389 --> 48:17.335
Yes, she is.

48:17.491 --> 48:20.165
- Oh, my God.
- Yeah, we had a little bit of a ruckus.

48:20.260 --> 48:22.001
Oh, my God!

48:22.729 --> 48:24.436
- That your phone?
- Julie's.

48:30.704 --> 48:31.705
Kieran.

48:33.006 --> 48:36.385
Hey listen, when you get up there,
let the horse into the pasture.

48:36.510 --> 48:38.581
She loves to run around in the grass.

48:38.712 --> 48:40.749
Grab a bottle of wine,
make yourself a fire,

48:40.881 --> 48:43.521
stay as long as you want.
This is gonna be good for you.

48:43.617 --> 48:46.962
- She's going to his ranch.
- Oh, my God.

48:48.422 --> 48:50.026
- That's code.
- What?

48:50.123 --> 48:53.366
It's code, Tim.
You should watch Law & Order:

48:54.394 --> 48:59.537
Horse is heroin. Grass is marijuana.

48:59.699 --> 49:02.976
The horse likes to
run around on the grass.

49:03.103 --> 49:05.743
The heroin likes to
run around on the marijuana.

49:06.873 --> 49:10.082
Wine. Alcohol.

49:10.210 --> 49:11.951
Like beer. Or wine.

49:13.380 --> 49:15.724
Oh, man, they are planning
one hell of a party.

49:15.882 --> 49:17.793
It's gonna be wild up there.

49:17.918 --> 49:22.264
I think that you need to get out of
my house in the next... 30 seconds,

49:22.389 --> 49:24.630
before I beat you to death
with the chair that you're sitting in.

49:24.958 --> 49:27.768
- What?
- You have to go. I want you to go.

49:28.728 --> 49:32.335
- Who's gonna help you with Julie?
- Who's gonna help me with Julie?

49:32.466 --> 49:34.104
You didn't really
just say that, did you?

49:34.234 --> 49:36.145
Because of you,
Julie thinks I'm having an affair

49:36.269 --> 49:37.646
and she's on her way to Kieran's ranch!

49:37.771 --> 49:40.081
Whatever you do,
don't help me with Julie!

49:40.240 --> 49:42.516
We should go there and we should
explain the whole mix-up.

49:42.642 --> 49:45.782
I don't know where it is. It's unlisted!
He goes there to disappear!

49:45.912 --> 49:50.190
Please, please, I'm begging you!
Go, leave, go!

49:50.317 --> 49:51.352
I'm sorry.

49:54.120 --> 49:55.656
I'm sorry, Tim.

49:59.926 --> 50:03.271
Wait. Tim, Tim!

50:03.430 --> 50:07.606
I work at the Canoga Processing Center.

50:07.767 --> 50:11.772
It's only the second-largest [RS
processing center on the west coast.

50:11.938 --> 50:13.713
And you're telling me
this now because...?

50:13.840 --> 50:18.289
If Kieran has a ranch, we can
ind the address from his tax return.

50:18.378 --> 50:23.123
And if he's up there sleeping
with Julie, that's not business-related.

50:23.216 --> 50:24.559
He can't deduct that.

50:25.819 --> 50:31.167
- You can get me his tax returns?
- No. But I know somebody who can.

50:31.958 --> 50:35.405
- There it is, The mother ship.
- It looks deserted.

50:35.529 --> 50:38.635
No, no, no. He's in there.
My boss never sleeps.

50:39.299 --> 50:41.074
Be careful around this guy.

50:41.201 --> 50:43.807
- He can tell what you're thinking.
- What are you talking about?

50:43.904 --> 50:47.408
Don't look him in the eye.
Don't think any embarrassing thoughts.

50:47.541 --> 50:50.249
Just keep your mind blank.

50:54.881 --> 50:58.328
Therman? I'd like you to meet
a friend of mine, Tim Conrad.

50:59.085 --> 51:00.393
Hi.

51:02.155 --> 51:05.762
I could use some help and Barry says
you're just the man for the job.

51:06.726 --> 51:07.761
Have 3 Seat.

51:08.495 --> 51:11.442
I did an audit on a
Steven Conrad two years ago.

51:11.565 --> 51:12.600
Any relation?

51:13.233 --> 51:16.180
- Where does he live?
- Bayside State Prison.

51:16.336 --> 51:17.838
He's doing seven years.

51:19.906 --> 51:21.852
Are you hiding something, Mr, Conrad?

51:22.175 --> 51:26.351
- What is it that you do for a living?
- Don't ask. He makes money.

51:26.513 --> 51:28.618
Nobody knows
where it comes from, though.

51:28.748 --> 51:30.625
Shall we take a look
at his return, Barry?

51:33.019 --> 51:36.193
Guys, I think we're
getting a little off track here.

51:36.289 --> 51:38.394
- Look, I'm in a little bit of a rush.
- That's him.

51:39.693 --> 51:42.936
Guys, I don't have much time, so...

51:45.298 --> 51:47.039
Mr. Conrad...

51:48.935 --> 51:52.712
Men lie to me a thousand times a day.

51:54.240 --> 51:59.781
And my job is to
End the truth. Right, Barry?

52:00.880 --> 52:02.553
I've studied the human mind.

52:02.716 --> 52:06.892
I've learned how to read it and,
ultimately, control it.

52:06.987 --> 52:08.898
This is fascinating,
I can't wait to read it.

52:08.989 --> 52:11.128
It's $14.99 on my website,

52:11.257 --> 52:13.737
- OK.
- Plus shipping and handling.

52:13.893 --> 52:15.395
Even if I buy it here?

52:15.495 --> 52:19.568
It's shipped from somewhere else,
isn't it? And I've been handling it.

52:21.334 --> 52:23.439
Could you just tell Therman
why we're here?

52:23.570 --> 52:27.746
We are looking for an address
of a nondeductible vacation property.

52:28.975 --> 52:31.114
You are looking for
someone or something.

52:33.146 --> 52:37.458
That's exactly right.
Tim is looking for his girlfriend.

52:37.584 --> 52:41.191
She ran off with an artist.
They are probably sleeping together.

52:41.321 --> 52:43.267
- Oh, God...
- Your girlfriend has left you.

52:43.423 --> 52:46.870
- Tim, he can see right through you.
- Well, you also just told him that.

52:47.193 --> 52:49.503
Are you still skeptical, Mr, Conrad?

52:50.430 --> 52:53.206
Watch this. Barry...

52:54.868 --> 52:55.869
What is he doing?

52:56.770 --> 53:01.276
He's making me do something.
What is he making me do?

53:01.374 --> 53:02.682
You're not doing anything, Barry.

53:02.809 --> 53:04.880
That's right, Barry.
You're not doing anything.

53:05.211 --> 53:08.283
I'm not doing anything.

53:08.381 --> 53:13.558
- I'm paralyzed, Oh, God.
- God can't hear you, Barry.

53:13.687 --> 53:15.633
- Tim?
- Tim can't hear you, Barry.

53:15.722 --> 53:19.966
- No, actually, I can hear him.
- My body's a prison.

53:21.394 --> 53:26.309
This is so painful,
I can't move, Tim.

53:27.133 --> 53:30.671
Tim, help me. Help me, Tim.

53:30.804 --> 53:33.307
All right, you know what, Barry?
Just move. You can do it. Just move.

53:37.811 --> 53:38.812
I release you.

53:43.049 --> 53:46.724
OK, I will never take movement
for granted, ever again.

53:47.487 --> 53:50.934
Well, I was wrong. Apparently,
his brain really is your puppet.

53:51.257 --> 53:52.861
I need an address.

53:52.992 --> 53:56.872
- Can you help me, please?
- Perhaps. For a price.

53:56.996 --> 53:57.997
How much?

53:58.164 --> 54:02.704
I just need to hear Barry say,
"You can eat my pudding."

54:03.903 --> 54:05.280
No.

54:06.005 --> 54:09.009
Barry, I can make you say it.

54:09.342 --> 54:14.621
But with your own free will, say,
"You can eat my pudding."

54:14.748 --> 54:16.591
I'm not gonna say it.

54:17.217 --> 54:19.026
Barry, I'm gonna eat it, anyway!

54:19.119 --> 54:23.033
But I want you to say,
"You can eat my pudding!"

54:24.691 --> 54:28.036
Barry, I will give you a thousand
dollars if you say it, right now.

54:28.361 --> 54:32.138
A thousand dollars?
Barry, your friend is a high roller.

54:32.866 --> 54:36.370
- You are hiding something.
- Wait a minute. No, wait...

54:37.370 --> 54:39.543
Can we just stick to the issue at hand?

54:40.373 --> 54:44.048
You almost had me. But you cannot
declare offshore investment losses

54:44.377 --> 54:48.416
against future capital gains.
Any child knows that.

54:48.548 --> 54:52.553
I'll have to ask
my accountant about that.

55:11.404 --> 55:12.610
Mr. Conrad...

55:13.273 --> 55:15.685
,,,you, my friend... are being audited.

55:15.809 --> 55:17.755
NO, HO, HO.

55:17.911 --> 55:19.857
Call the 800 number.

55:21.523 --> 55:22.593
I release you.

55:25.560 --> 55:26.800
Hey, Tim?

55:30.432 --> 55:33.538
I guess you just have to remember
what te wise man once said...

55:34.970 --> 55:37.246
"Everything happens for a reason."

55:38.774 --> 55:41.050
- You know who said that?
- Shut up, Barry.

55:42.210 --> 55:44.554
- You did. You're the wise man.
- Don't talk.

55:44.646 --> 55:46.592
Don't say a word.
Don't move your lips.

55:50.218 --> 55:55.167
Oh, my God. It's Martha.
it's my ex-wife.

56:01.997 --> 56:03.999
There's my magic man.

56:15.443 --> 56:17.787
- Look at you. OK,
- Get in the car, Pudding.

56:28.924 --> 56:30.597
I used to call her Pudding.

56:32.928 --> 56:35.772
Look, why don't we just each
go home, we'll get some sleep,

56:35.864 --> 56:37.002
and I'll see you tomorrow at the dinner.

56:37.332 --> 56:38.868
OK.

56:41.870 --> 56:44.043
I think I left my bus pass
at your apartment.

56:44.172 --> 56:46.118
- I'll drive you home.
- OK.

56:48.043 --> 56:50.284
I left my keys at your apartment, too.

56:51.880 --> 56:54.986
That's OK. You know what?
I'll just sleep here. I have a cubicle.

56:55.116 --> 56:56.959
- I can pull two chairs together.
- it's all right.

56:57.118 --> 56:59.530
- Get in the car.
- I can fashion them into a bed.

56:59.654 --> 57:02.191
They... Well, they son of
roll apart in the middle, so...

57:02.324 --> 57:03.962
- Barry, Barry...
- ...you sag,

57:04.125 --> 57:06.071
- You can stay with me.
- Don't worry about me.

57:06.194 --> 57:08.572
- I insist.
- Really?

57:08.697 --> 57:11.143
- Yeah.
- I won't cramp your style?

57:11.233 --> 57:14.077
- it's already cramped.
- OK.

57:26.147 --> 57:28.491
- What are you doing?
- You're gonna propose to her?

57:28.650 --> 57:30.652
I have, a few times.

57:30.819 --> 57:33.163
- Why do you keep carrying this around?
- In case she changes her mind.

57:33.488 --> 57:35.695
- Please don't go through my pockets.
- OK.

57:40.161 --> 57:41.196
Hey, Tim?

57:42.063 --> 57:44.168
The first night alone
is always the hardest.

57:44.499 --> 57:47.105
I can sleep in there
with you if you want.

57:47.903 --> 57:49.007
No, thank you.

57:49.170 --> 57:51.172
Hey, just don't think about
the fact that you can't sleep.

57:51.506 --> 57:54.680
Because then you're sunk. Then you
just start thinking, "Whats going on?"

57:54.843 --> 57:57.756
Your mind starts reeling.
"Where's Julie?

57:57.879 --> 58:00.689
Oh, she's with Kieran.
Is he a better lover than I am?

58:00.849 --> 58:03.625
Yes, he is." Don't think about that.

58:03.752 --> 58:05.595
Get those thoughts out of your head.

58:06.922 --> 58:11.598
- Why are you putting on aftershave?
- Force of habit.

58:11.726 --> 58:14.639
When I was married, I used to
stay up late working on my mice,

58:14.763 --> 58:16.902
and Martha hated
the smell of formaldehyde.

58:18.266 --> 58:23.306
You can smell them both, Barry.
Two layers of bad smell,

58:24.239 --> 58:27.379
That's exactly what Martha used to say.

58:29.077 --> 58:30.317
Good night.

58:38.920 --> 58:40.297
Tim?

58:44.793 --> 58:47.637
- Tim?
- What, Barry?

58:47.762 --> 58:49.571
I can't sleep.
I'm too excited about dinner.

58:49.664 --> 58:51.735
- Oh, God!
- What are you gonna wear?

58:51.900 --> 58:54.244
Should I rent a tux?
Or is that too formal?

58:54.336 --> 58:55.246
Here's the thing:

58:55.570 --> 58:58.414
It's always better to be overdressed
than underdressed, right?

59:06.581 --> 59:08.322
Thanks, Tim! That's great!

59:09.317 --> 59:13.356
Oh, he ate it! He's eating paper!

59:14.422 --> 59:15.526
NO...

01:00:20.822 --> 01:00:24.929
I'll be back in a few hours.
Don't play with the stove.

01:00:25.060 --> 01:00:27.734
Don't do anything with electricity.

01:00:28.997 --> 01:00:30.601
Do you understand?

01:00:30.732 --> 01:00:32.871
Sometimes I think
you think I'm an idiot.

01:00:33.001 --> 01:00:35.277
Just stay in the chair. Promise me.

01:00:35.403 --> 01:00:39.351
I will. I will stay in the chair.
Why is this brunch so important?

01:00:39.674 --> 01:00:41.620
Because the future
of my career depends on it.

01:00:41.743 --> 01:00:43.723
It's a very important potential client.

01:00:43.845 --> 01:00:45.688
- I can help.
- You want to help me?

01:00:45.847 --> 01:00:47.793
- Stay in the chair.
- OK.

01:00:48.516 --> 01:00:51.087
I'll pick you up for dinner. All right?

01:00:53.121 --> 01:00:55.226
- You gonna stay in that chair?
- Yes.

01:00:55.356 --> 01:00:56.562
That's it.

01:01:05.900 --> 01:01:06.901
Hello?

01:01:07.035 --> 01:01:09.208
You got everything
you need for brunch?

01:01:10.138 --> 01:01:14.644
OK, you got me working Saturday,
so I'm billing you overtime for this.

01:01:14.776 --> 01:01:17.757
You're going to
Madison Restaurant, 10am.

01:01:17.879 --> 01:01:21.884
Don't be late, They're Swiss.
And make sure Julie's there.

01:01:22.050 --> 01:01:25.156
- They're dying to meet her.
- OK, Julie'll be there.

01:01:26.654 --> 01:01:27.758
Tim?

01:01:27.889 --> 01:01:29.459
Tim!

01:01:30.959 --> 01:01:32.404
Tim?

01:01:44.506 --> 01:01:48.613
Tim? Tim! Tim!

01:01:49.511 --> 01:01:51.184
Hi, Tim? We switched phones.

01:01:51.312 --> 01:01:54.987
I need to talk to you.
Julie has to go to that brunch! OK.

01:02:01.523 --> 01:02:04.436
Hi, Tim, me again. I just
realized you can't get my messages.

01:02:04.759 --> 01:02:09.538
My password is P-A-S-S-W-O-R-D. OK.

01:02:11.799 --> 01:02:13.506
Oh, God!

01:02:14.502 --> 01:02:16.607
You can't get that message,
either! Why am I...'?!

01:02:22.677 --> 01:02:25.123
- This way, sir.
- Thank you.

01:02:26.347 --> 01:02:28.349
We feared that some
disaster had befallen you.

01:02:28.683 --> 01:02:31.459
- I'm so sorry I'm late.
- And where is...?

01:02:31.619 --> 01:02:35.795
Julie sends her regrets.
She dropped a box on her foot

01:02:35.890 --> 01:02:40.066
- and broke a distal phalange.
- Please wish her a swift recovery.

01:02:40.195 --> 01:02:43.005
I had hoped for another woman
to lend some poetry.

01:02:43.131 --> 01:02:44.804
I understood from my husband

01:02:44.966 --> 01:02:47.810
I would not have to suffer
another business conversation.

01:02:47.969 --> 01:02:50.347
What was it Baudelaire said?

01:02:50.471 --> 01:02:52.917
"Misunderstanding makes
the world go 'round."

01:02:53.041 --> 01:02:55.385
I see we will
have poetry after all.

01:02:55.510 --> 01:02:58.753
It is rare to find an American
businessman with a sense of culture.

01:03:10.425 --> 01:03:14.396
Tim! It's me again! Barry!
Disregard all previous messages!

01:03:14.729 --> 01:03:18.506
I figured it out!
Help is on the way! Bye!

01:03:20.401 --> 01:03:23.382
Obviously, many of the
strategies are complex.

01:03:23.504 --> 01:03:27.418
- I imagine you have several questions.
- I am a simple man, Mr. Conrad.

01:03:27.542 --> 01:03:31.513
My father left me with very little,
except for all of his money.

01:03:31.679 --> 01:03:34.853
The world is full of people
who want to separate me from it.

01:03:35.016 --> 01:03:38.520
Why should I trust you
with $100 million?

01:03:38.686 --> 01:03:40.529
A very fair question.

01:03:41.522 --> 01:03:44.867
Now, you're obviously
very civilized people.

01:03:45.026 --> 01:03:48.439
But, unfortunately, the world
of finance is a brutal place.

01:03:48.763 --> 01:03:53.041
The good hunters win.
The bad hunters lose.

01:03:53.201 --> 01:03:55.442
I am a very good hunter.

01:03:55.770 --> 01:03:58.546
You are refreshingly honest,
Mr. Conrad.

01:03:58.706 --> 01:04:02.119
I try to be. I hope we can
do business together.

01:04:03.645 --> 01:04:04.646
A call for you, sir.

01:04:07.882 --> 01:04:10.089
I'm so sorry.
Excuse me. Hello?

01:04:10.218 --> 01:04:11.458
I got your back, Wm.
Can you hear me?

01:04:11.786 --> 01:04:12.958
- Hello?
- Hello!

01:04:13.087 --> 01:04:14.293
- Hello? Hello?
- Hello?

01:04:14.422 --> 01:04:15.833
Hello. Hello.

01:04:16.891 --> 01:04:22.341
Hello. My name is Tim's brother,
Barry, and this is Julie.

01:04:22.463 --> 01:04:25.103
Tim, look. I brought Julie.

01:04:25.233 --> 01:04:29.181
Hi, my love.
Oh, I have missed you so.

01:04:30.738 --> 01:04:31.739
YOU...

01:04:32.907 --> 01:04:35.945
You know... Your phalange.
You shouldn't be here.

01:04:36.077 --> 01:04:39.251
Nonsense,
She is the picture of health.

01:04:39.347 --> 01:04:42.021
Please. Sit. Sit, sit.

01:04:45.653 --> 01:04:47.189
Thank you.

01:04:50.024 --> 01:04:52.334
- Birgit Mueller.
- Such a pleasure.

01:04:52.460 --> 01:04:54.963
- Martin Mueller, delighted.
- Such a pleasure.

01:04:55.096 --> 01:04:57.975
And I am Barry. Delightful.

01:05:00.201 --> 01:05:03.614
I am so pleased you could join us.
I always say you do not know a man

01:05:03.938 --> 01:05:06.544
until you meet his partner in love.

01:05:06.674 --> 01:05:10.451
I couldn't agree more. I would love
to go over some of these main points.

01:05:10.611 --> 01:05:14.457
- Where are you from?!
- We are from Switzerland.

01:05:14.549 --> 01:05:16.529
You know what?
We're gonna focus on business.

01:05:16.651 --> 01:05:20.292
Switzerland! I love Switzerland.
It is one of my favorite countries.

01:05:20.455 --> 01:05:23.629
I love your army knives
with the toothpicks,

01:05:23.958 --> 01:05:28.907
And your cheese. Does the cheese
come out of the cow with the holes?

01:05:30.732 --> 01:05:34.236
Our countries are not enemies.
They are friends.

01:05:34.369 --> 01:05:37.578
- We are friends,
- You have been to Switzerland?

01:05:37.705 --> 01:05:40.481
No, bull have a friend
who drives a Volvo.

01:05:40.641 --> 01:05:42.746
And I speak a little of your language.

01:05:48.216 --> 01:05:50.822
That's my brother. Always joking.

01:05:52.420 --> 01:05:54.331
It's a jokey joke, ja?

01:06:00.695 --> 01:06:04.666
You know, we should continue
this conversation back in my office.

01:06:04.832 --> 01:06:07.574
But I have not received my salmon.

01:06:07.702 --> 01:06:09.375
Or my green salad.

01:06:15.076 --> 01:06:16.384
So...

01:06:16.511 --> 01:06:20.687
...do you and Julie have
wedding bells in your future?

01:06:20.848 --> 01:06:24.887
That's kind of a sore topic. He keeps
asking her, but she keeps saying no.

01:06:26.020 --> 01:06:30.628
- Ask me again.
- No, it's not the right time.

01:06:30.958 --> 01:06:34.565
If a woman asks you to propose,
it is the right time.

01:06:35.296 --> 01:06:36.366
Really, I can't.

01:06:36.531 --> 01:06:38.772
- Why not?
- Do it. Do it!

01:06:38.900 --> 01:06:40.743
- I don't have a ring.
- Yeah, you do.

01:06:40.868 --> 01:06:43.576
- No, I don't.
- Yeah, you do, it's in your pocket.

01:06:43.704 --> 01:06:47.117
- Come on, You know you have it...
- Barry...

01:06:47.241 --> 01:06:51.417
- Told ya.
- You are a hunter, Mr. Conrad.

01:06:51.546 --> 01:06:53.617
There is nothing more
honorable than for a man

01:06:53.948 --> 01:06:55.928
to join himself to his lady love.

01:06:56.717 --> 01:07:01.063
Join yourself to her.
In the name of love.

01:07:01.155 --> 01:07:03.658
Join yourself in the name of love.

01:07:05.259 --> 01:07:08.968
You must kneel, Mr. Conrad.
She is a princess.

01:07:09.797 --> 01:07:11.242
Thank you.

01:07:20.675 --> 01:07:22.677
Something's happening!

01:07:24.111 --> 01:07:26.148
- Julie,,,
- Call me Darla.

01:07:26.280 --> 01:07:29.784
- Oh, I don't want to call you Darla.
- Julie's just a nickname.

01:07:29.917 --> 01:07:33.455
- I want it to be real.
- Look into her eyes.

01:07:34.021 --> 01:07:35.193
Look, look.

01:07:36.924 --> 01:07:41.202
There is your home.
There is your future.

01:07:42.797 --> 01:07:43.798
I love you, Tim.

01:07:44.999 --> 01:07:46.706
Do it, do it, do it!

01:07:46.834 --> 01:07:48.780
Do it!

01:07:48.870 --> 01:07:50.713
- Julie.
- Darla.

01:07:51.038 --> 01:07:54.713
Darla. Will you marry me?

01:07:55.042 --> 01:07:57.454
Yes. Yes!

01:07:58.646 --> 01:08:00.057
LOOK at that. We did it.

01:08:11.492 --> 01:08:13.733
- Julie.
- I thought this was Julie.

01:08:13.861 --> 01:08:16.398
- Nope. I'm Julie.
- They are both Julie.

01:08:16.531 --> 01:08:18.135
Julie and Julie.

01:08:18.232 --> 01:08:20.303
Susana thought you were
gonna lose your promotion

01:08:20.468 --> 01:08:21.810
if I didn't show up today.

01:08:21.903 --> 01:08:25.578
Look at you. You had
a replacement all lined up.

01:08:25.706 --> 01:08:27.515
-Yeah.
- No, no, no.

01:08:27.642 --> 01:08:30.179
- This is a huge misunderstanding.
- Let me explain.

01:08:30.310 --> 01:08:34.191
This is Darla. She's a naughty
schoolgirl who cheats on her taxes.

01:08:34.314 --> 01:08:36.055
I didn't know whether
you were gonna come today,

01:08:36.183 --> 01:08:38.720
so I brought Darla to keep
things running smoothly.

01:08:39.053 --> 01:08:41.158
Very important potential client.

01:08:41.322 --> 01:08:43.063
That clears that up.
Yeah. Thank you.

01:08:43.189 --> 01:08:47.696
Darling, you're embarrassing
yourself. it's over.

01:08:47.828 --> 01:08:50.774
She's really quite a catch, Tim.
Congratulations.

01:08:51.098 --> 01:08:53.578
- No! Julie...
- Nice to have met you.

01:08:53.701 --> 01:08:56.375
- He's very crafty.
-Julie! Julie!

01:08:56.504 --> 01:08:59.383
I'm so sorry, I hope we can
continue this at a later date,

01:08:59.506 --> 01:09:01.850
- but, actually, I love her.
- Wait, Tim?

01:09:02.176 --> 01:09:04.884
- Julie!
- Tim?

01:09:05.746 --> 01:09:07.850
Julie! Julie, look...

01:09:08.182 --> 01:09:10.890
Wait, wait, I know that looked awkward,
but you've gotta trust me.

01:09:11.018 --> 01:09:13.862
- Trust you?
- Yes. I trust you.

01:09:13.955 --> 01:09:16.868
I know you spent the night at Kieran's
ranch. I know nothing happened.

01:09:17.191 --> 01:09:18.636
Right?

01:09:18.759 --> 01:09:20.796
I didn't go to Kieran's ranch
last night.

01:09:20.928 --> 01:09:23.374
- I'm going now.
- No! Don't go! Don't go!

01:09:23.531 --> 01:09:26.808
Tim, I have to go. It's my job. We're
going to San Francisco this weekend

01:09:27.134 --> 01:09:30.308
to set up for the show. He wants me
to be part of his artistic process.

01:09:30.438 --> 01:09:34.443
His artistic process...
That means sex, Julie.

01:09:34.575 --> 01:09:36.782
He told me last nigh!
when I broke into his house!

01:09:38.045 --> 01:09:39.546
You broke into his house?

01:09:42.617 --> 01:09:45.325
My God. I guess there really
is a you I don't know.

01:09:46.988 --> 01:09:49.491
It's too bad. I was so
in love with the other one.

01:09:57.965 --> 01:09:59.501
- Hop in.
- MOVE.

01:09:59.634 --> 01:10:00.772
OK.

01:10:07.074 --> 01:10:08.917
Tim, Tim...

01:10:28.162 --> 01:10:29.505
May dead!

01:10:33.768 --> 01:10:35.941
I don't think you're
a very nice person, Tim.

01:10:36.037 --> 01:10:40.281
Just stay out of my life.
And I'm keeping the ring.

01:10:49.350 --> 01:10:51.887
I think that was really good for her.

01:10:59.960 --> 01:11:01.462
See? It works.

01:11:07.334 --> 01:11:09.371
I can't help but think
this is partially my fault.

01:11:09.503 --> 01:11:13.508
Really? Well, it is your fault.
it's 100 percent your fault!

01:11:16.711 --> 01:11:18.156
I'm sorry.

01:11:27.154 --> 01:11:31.000
Hello, Therman. YOU win.

01:11:31.325 --> 01:11:33.362
You can eat my pudding.

01:11:34.695 --> 01:11:37.835
Thirty-one Lighthill Drive.
OK, Therman.

01:11:46.874 --> 01:11:50.686
I don't even know who he is anymore.
it's like I'm having a bad dream.

01:11:51.846 --> 01:11:54.952
I mean, am I crazy?
Am I completely delusional, here?

01:11:55.516 --> 01:11:57.518
I don't even know
what's going on anymore.

01:12:00.354 --> 01:12:01.958
I'm sorry. I shouldn't be
unloading this.

01:12:02.089 --> 01:12:04.592
I want to photograph you right now.

01:12:07.228 --> 01:12:10.539
I don't think it's the
best time right now, really.

01:12:11.565 --> 01:12:14.978
It is exactly the best time.
I've never seen you like this.

01:12:15.603 --> 01:12:19.107
You're so raw, so wonderfully
visible. So beautiful.

01:12:20.608 --> 01:12:22.053
This is weird, Kieran.
I don't think we should...

01:12:22.376 --> 01:12:26.620
Not doing this would be weird.
Keep talking. Tell me about Tim.

01:12:26.747 --> 01:12:29.284
I don't know. I mean, I just...

01:12:31.585 --> 01:12:34.429
I just always thought that
there was this decent...

01:12:34.555 --> 01:12:37.399
...basic person underneath it all.

01:12:37.491 --> 01:12:40.301
You'd think that you would know
someone after two years.

01:12:40.427 --> 01:12:43.738
But, no. That's bad.

01:12:46.167 --> 01:12:49.080
He's such a smooth talker.
So convincing.

01:12:49.403 --> 01:12:51.849
I don't even know if anything
he's ever said to me is true.

01:12:51.972 --> 01:12:55.419
- These pictures are gonna be amazing.
- Kieran, you've lost your mind!

01:12:55.509 --> 01:12:57.921
- This is crazy! No!
- Don't light it, It's art.

01:12:58.078 --> 01:12:59.580
I don't want to take pictures.
Can we just stop it?

01:13:01.849 --> 01:13:02.953
What are you doing here?

01:13:03.083 --> 01:13:05.085
Julie, there's something
I need to tell you.

01:13:05.186 --> 01:13:07.928
- Kieran has gonorrhea.
- No, I don't.

01:13:08.088 --> 01:13:09.931
- You might.
- I don't.

01:13:10.090 --> 01:13:11.967
- Well, she does, She has gonorrhea.
- What?

01:13:12.092 --> 01:13:13.765
- Don't sleep with her.
- She doesn't.

01:13:13.928 --> 01:13:15.498
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

01:13:15.629 --> 01:13:17.609
Because you can get it
from riding the bus.

01:13:17.765 --> 01:13:19.676
- No, you can't.
- Yes, you can, Tim.

01:13:19.800 --> 01:13:20.801
That's how my wife got it.

01:13:20.935 --> 01:13:23.506
Barry, no one here has gonorrhea.

01:13:25.206 --> 01:13:26.651
I do.

01:13:29.109 --> 01:13:30.884
I have gonorrhea.

01:13:33.547 --> 01:13:37.120
I got gonorrhea from my wife,
who got it from a bus seat.

01:13:37.218 --> 01:13:39.198
And no one should sleep with me.

01:13:44.358 --> 01:13:45.701
OK.

01:13:45.826 --> 01:13:48.534
Could I speak with Julie alone, please?

01:13:54.535 --> 01:13:57.175
Tim, you have to tell her
what's in your heart,

01:13:57.304 --> 01:13:59.181
- you have to be honest with her.
- Yeah.

01:13:59.306 --> 01:14:01.479
That's what I did with Martha,
and that did not work.

01:14:01.642 --> 01:14:03.815
But I think this'll work for you.

01:14:03.911 --> 01:14:07.381
- OK.
- Thank you. All right.

01:14:16.090 --> 01:14:18.536
Have you ever just spent Eve months

01:14:18.659 --> 01:14:21.765
living with a herd of goats,
as one of them?

01:14:22.930 --> 01:14:24.000
- No?
- No.

01:14:24.164 --> 01:14:25.575
That surprises me.

01:14:26.500 --> 01:14:30.846
The thing about a goat is, it never
denies itself what it's hungry for.

01:14:31.005 --> 01:14:35.715
A goat will eat anything.
A goat could probably eat a bike.

01:14:38.078 --> 01:14:41.525
A goal could eat itself,
if it was driven to it.

01:14:44.551 --> 01:14:46.895
I'm just a goat...

01:14:47.021 --> 01:14:50.298
,,,who's halfway through eating itself.

01:14:56.597 --> 01:14:59.578
Just to be clear, what exactly
are we talking about?

01:15:01.201 --> 01:15:02.544
Everything.

01:15:04.204 --> 01:15:08.209
I had no idea. It happened one night
three years ago, before we ever met.

01:15:08.542 --> 01:15:10.146
I haven't seen her since.

01:15:10.477 --> 01:15:13.151
So she just popped back up
into your life, like that?

01:15:13.480 --> 01:15:16.222
She tried to get in touch with me
and Barry intercepted the message.

01:15:16.550 --> 01:15:21.795
- So it's all Barry's fault?
- Barry is... He's a sweet guy,

01:15:21.922 --> 01:15:27.065
but he is a tornado of destruction.
The only friends he has are dead mice,

01:15:27.161 --> 01:15:30.233
and that's 'cause they're the
only ones that can't get away from him.

01:15:34.068 --> 01:15:36.674
You know what else mice can't do?

01:15:36.804 --> 01:15:38.750
They can't lie.

01:15:40.307 --> 01:15:43.117
Barry. Barry!

01:15:45.079 --> 01:15:46.922
I'm gonna go to San Francisco tonight.

01:15:47.014 --> 01:15:50.154
And... I'll come by
to pack around eight.

01:15:50.484 --> 01:15:53.522
I think it's better if you're not there.

01:16:21.548 --> 01:16:23.960
I never really knew
what Martha thought of me

01:16:24.051 --> 01:16:27.123
until I heard her
talking behind my back.

01:16:30.491 --> 01:16:33.961
You were lying to me the whole time.
You didn't like me.

01:16:35.496 --> 01:16:39.967
"How do I get ahead in business?
How do I get ahead? Oh, I know...

01:16:40.901 --> 01:16:44.348
I'll ind a great taxidermist
and I'll hit him with my car.

01:16:44.705 --> 01:16:47.982
And then I'll invite him
to dinner. That'll do it."

01:16:49.376 --> 01:16:53.415
Well, somebody forgot to tell you
there is no "me" in "mean."

01:16:54.815 --> 01:16:59.696
Well, there is a bit of a happy ending.

01:16:59.820 --> 01:17:02.733
'Cause the mean guy
finally got what he deserved.

01:17:08.929 --> 01:17:11.842
World's smallest violin,
and it's playing just for you.

01:17:15.602 --> 01:17:18.549
- Sorry.
- What?

01:17:19.773 --> 01:17:23.186
- I'm sorry.
- Oh, OK. Whatever.

01:19:29.570 --> 01:19:30.981
- Hello?
- Tim!

01:19:31.138 --> 01:19:33.379
I heard you had an
interesting brunch this morning.

01:19:33.707 --> 01:19:35.311
Sir, I can explain.

01:19:35.475 --> 01:19:39.082
You might want to explain it
to Mn Mueller

01:19:41.315 --> 01:19:43.818
You should have told me
Barry was your fool.

01:19:43.984 --> 01:19:46.396
We have the
same game in Switzerland

01:19:46.720 --> 01:19:48.495
Dinner for Unterschlagen.

01:19:48.655 --> 01:19:50.396
I am very much looking forward

01:19:50.724 --> 01:19:53.204
to seeing the two of you
this evening, Mn Conrad

01:19:55.862 --> 01:19:57.341
Where are you?
Dinners about to start.

01:19:58.665 --> 01:19:59.837
There's been a complication.

01:20:00.000 --> 01:20:02.947
Tim, for Christ sake,
we're running on fumes.

01:20:03.070 --> 01:20:05.516
If we don't make this deal tonight,
there is no Fender Financial.

01:20:05.839 --> 01:20:08.945
So, hurry up,
We gotta land Mueller tonight.

01:20:17.284 --> 01:20:20.356
My guys a lock. You know what
I'm saying? Mueller's gonna love him.

01:20:20.454 --> 01:20:21.455
Now, he might be a little late.

01:20:21.788 --> 01:20:23.790
- He's on his way, but...
- Tim!

01:20:24.858 --> 01:20:27.031
Sir, I've run into
a little bit of a problem.

01:20:27.194 --> 01:20:29.800
Never mind that. You know,
ever since I invited you to this thing,

01:20:29.930 --> 01:20:32.467
Caldwell's been
telling me I made a mistake.

01:20:32.599 --> 01:20:34.135
He says you're not cut out for it.

01:20:34.268 --> 01:20:37.147
- Really?
- Caldwell is full of shit.

01:20:37.271 --> 01:20:42.220
Mueller told me your guy was good.
I had no idea he was this good.

01:20:42.876 --> 01:20:44.549
Well, I try to look at the bright side.

01:20:44.878 --> 01:20:47.222
You could say I'm an
eternal optometrist,

01:20:47.381 --> 01:20:49.622
When life gives you lemons,
you make lemonade.

01:20:49.750 --> 01:20:51.559
Unless you don't have
any water or sugar.

01:20:51.718 --> 01:20:53.425
And then, then you just eat the lemons.

01:20:53.553 --> 01:20:57.057
And the rind will give you diarrhea.
So, mama mia, papa pia,

01:20:57.157 --> 01:20:59.660
baby got the diarr... Hey, Tim!

01:21:00.961 --> 01:21:03.965
Mr. Conrad! You have
been missing all the fun.

01:21:04.731 --> 01:21:06.574
Barry... you're here.

01:21:06.733 --> 01:21:10.909
Yes, and I have been telling Sir
Lancelot that you deserve a promotion.

01:21:11.071 --> 01:21:13.574
And he's been making
a pretty persuasive case, Tim.

01:21:13.907 --> 01:21:17.013
Tim, I'd like to
introduce my friend, Lewis,

01:21:17.144 --> 01:21:20.091
- and his wife, Diane.
- Your wife?

01:21:20.180 --> 01:21:21.420
For now.

01:21:22.816 --> 01:21:28.129
- Honey, please.
- Honey, please. You're so pathetic!

01:21:28.255 --> 01:21:31.702
My God, it's raining men.
I don't know who's more gorgeous.

01:21:32.959 --> 01:21:34.438
Well, beauty's only skin deep.

01:21:34.594 --> 01:21:37.200
Unless there's something wrong
with your bone structure. And then...

01:21:37.331 --> 01:21:40.471
...you could have flawless skin
and still be very ugly.

01:21:40.600 --> 01:21:44.275
Because your bones are just... gross.

01:21:44.371 --> 01:21:46.510
Lewis, Diane, there's someone
I'd like you to meet.

01:21:46.640 --> 01:21:47.618
I think you're drunk.

01:21:47.941 --> 01:21:50.182
Not drunk enough to do you.

01:21:50.610 --> 01:21:54.217
Tim, when you said this was
a dinner for extraordinary people,

01:21:54.348 --> 01:21:55.986
I had no idea. Look at that.

01:21:56.116 --> 01:21:59.620
Are you hungry?
He hasn't eaten a lot today.

01:22:00.520 --> 01:22:01.624
Come on.

01:22:03.957 --> 01:22:04.958
Yes?

01:22:05.625 --> 01:22:08.299
OK... her. You know what she does?

01:22:08.395 --> 01:22:10.466
She communicates with dead pets.

01:22:10.630 --> 01:22:14.635
Lorenzo's mother wants to talk to him.

01:22:14.968 --> 01:22:17.312
Right? Nice?

01:22:17.471 --> 01:22:21.886
OK, that guy? Right there?
2002 National Beard Champion.

01:22:22.008 --> 01:22:24.215
I'm telling you,
these people are amazing.

01:22:24.344 --> 01:22:27.416
- I am so not in their league.
- Barry, what are you...

01:22:27.547 --> 01:22:31.689
- Why are you here?
- Because that's what friends do.

01:22:31.818 --> 01:22:35.163
I know, I know.
You chose some words carelessly.

01:22:35.255 --> 01:22:37.599
I know you are in a dark place,
but I also know

01:22:37.924 --> 01:22:41.337
that you need to show your boss
that you are friends with a winner.

01:22:41.495 --> 01:22:43.168
In my book, you're a winner, too.

01:22:44.998 --> 01:22:48.571
Ladies and gentlemen! Dinner is served.

01:22:54.274 --> 01:22:57.619
The eyes are but two of the Eve senses.

01:22:57.944 --> 01:23:02.359
Remove them and the others
become incredibly sensitive.

01:23:02.516 --> 01:23:04.462
But some people still ask:

01:23:04.584 --> 01:23:08.726
How can a blind man compete
at the Olympic Games as fencer?

01:23:08.855 --> 01:23:10.198
I will show you how.

01:23:14.294 --> 01:23:16.706
Absolutely tremendous!

01:23:17.030 --> 01:23:19.374
- All right!
- Are you enjoying this?

01:23:19.466 --> 01:23:24.074
Yes. Such a pleasure to laugh
at the misfortune of others.

01:23:25.105 --> 01:23:26.584
Are they cute when they're small,

01:23:26.706 --> 01:23:29.050
or are they pretty much
horrible the whole time?

01:23:30.444 --> 01:23:34.392
- Are you looking down my dress?
- No.

01:23:34.481 --> 01:23:37.087
- Why not?
- I don't know.

01:23:37.217 --> 01:23:39.390
- Tim, were you?
- No.

01:23:39.486 --> 01:23:42.228
- Please don't embarrass me.
- I'm not doing... Oh, God.

01:23:45.225 --> 01:23:47.466
- Here you go, sir.
- Here you are, ma'am. Bon appetit.

01:23:56.002 --> 01:23:59.176
I am receiving a message
from the other side!

01:24:02.943 --> 01:24:06.413
I'm trapped.
Where are they taking me?

01:24:06.580 --> 01:24:10.756
- She's talking to the lobster.
- The water, it...

01:24:11.418 --> 01:24:12.692
...boils!

01:24:27.501 --> 01:24:29.538
Thai might win. Thai might win.

01:24:38.311 --> 01:24:39.619
Fuck it. I don't care.

01:24:40.680 --> 01:24:45.356
So, Tim... I understand your guest
has an interesting hobby.

01:24:46.152 --> 01:24:49.133
I guess I'm up. Wish me luck.

01:24:54.294 --> 01:24:57.332
This is something that I call
the Tower of Dreamers.

01:25:08.742 --> 01:25:12.315
A thousand years ago, the only
people on Earth were monkeys.

01:25:12.412 --> 01:25:16.588
And they said,
"We'll never walk erectus.

01:25:16.716 --> 01:25:20.323
We'll never use tools.
We'll never talk."

01:25:20.487 --> 01:25:25.493
And then one monkey said: "Oh, yeah?
Well, I'm talking right now."

01:25:25.592 --> 01:25:28.835
That monkey... was a dreamer.

01:25:29.162 --> 01:25:31.335
- Mice dressed as monkeys.
- Yes-

01:25:31.498 --> 01:25:33.842
- Good.
- Oh, my God.

01:25:36.670 --> 01:25:39.014
Fast-forward 500 years.

01:25:41.875 --> 01:25:45.687
The Wright Brothers decide
to make themselves a 'Hying machine.

01:25:45.779 --> 01:25:51.195
"You fools! You idiots! What's
your problem?" everyone shouted.

01:25:51.351 --> 01:25:55.231
"That will never work because
plywood weighs more than air!"

01:25:55.355 --> 01:25:57.801
To which the Wright Brothers
responded:

01:25:58.558 --> 01:26:00.094
"No, it doesn't."

01:26:01.361 --> 01:26:03.773
The Wright Brothers were dreamers.

01:26:06.733 --> 01:26:11.443
The Earl of Sandwich
and Sir Francis Bacon.

01:26:11.571 --> 01:26:17.146
Had it not been for them, the BLT
would merely be lettuce and tomato.

01:26:20.213 --> 01:26:23.126
They were dreamers.
And sandwich makers.

01:26:24.884 --> 01:26:26.124
It's not over yet.

01:26:27.721 --> 01:26:30.167
Vincent van Gogh.

01:26:30.290 --> 01:26:34.238
Everyone told him,
"You only have one ear.

01:26:34.394 --> 01:26:36.897
You cannot be a great artist."

01:26:37.230 --> 01:26:41.178
And you know what he said?
"l can't hear you."

01:26:41.301 --> 01:26:43.247
Vincent van Gogh was a dreamer.

01:26:45.438 --> 01:26:46.746
- I love to paint.
- Really?

01:26:46.906 --> 01:26:48.852
- I love to paint.
- Are you any good?

01:26:49.175 --> 01:26:51.781
- I don't know.
- Of course not.

01:26:54.247 --> 01:26:57.456
Louis Pasteur turned
cheese into medicine.

01:27:07.293 --> 01:27:09.933
Benjamin Franklin.

01:27:10.263 --> 01:27:13.836
People said,
"You can't fly a kite in a rainstorm."

01:27:14.167 --> 01:27:19.617
And Ben Franklin said, "Yes, you can,
if you have an electric kite."

01:27:24.044 --> 01:27:26.354
Little detail with the kite.
That's good, ja?

01:27:26.479 --> 01:27:29.824
A man who broke more bones...

01:27:30.650 --> 01:27:32.823
...than any man in history:

01:27:35.722 --> 01:27:36.826
Eve! Knievel.

01:27:43.496 --> 01:27:44.736
It's fantastic.

01:27:44.864 --> 01:27:46.901
Well played, rookie. Well played.

01:27:47.233 --> 01:27:51.511
And who might this
handsome young lad be?

01:27:52.405 --> 01:27:53.713
Tim Conrad.

01:27:55.141 --> 01:27:59.590
He believes that someday he
will marry the girl of his dreams,

01:27:59.713 --> 01:28:02.990
even though every time
he asks, she says no.

01:28:03.316 --> 01:28:06.820
And even though, as we speak,
she is probably having sex

01:28:06.986 --> 01:28:12.834
with a handsome artist.
Tim Conrad... is a dreamer.

01:28:20.600 --> 01:28:24.275
So dare to dream.
Dream your wildest dreams.

01:28:24.404 --> 01:28:26.907
You can climb the highest mountain.

01:28:27.240 --> 01:28:31.916
You can drown in a teacup,
if you ind a big enough teacup.

01:28:32.045 --> 01:28:35.458
And if somebody tells you
that you can't do something,

01:28:35.582 --> 01:28:38.859
you say, "Yes, I can.

01:28:39.018 --> 01:28:41.965
'Cause I'm doing it right now!"

01:28:46.526 --> 01:28:48.369
Bravo!

01:28:48.461 --> 01:28:49.872
Bravo, Sir!

01:28:55.135 --> 01:28:57.741
You must come to Switzerland.
You'll be the toast of Zurich!

01:28:58.571 --> 01:29:01.074
I can't understand your accent!

01:29:03.777 --> 01:29:08.920
- Caldwell. This guy's taking it.
- The night is young.

01:29:10.550 --> 01:29:14.589
Gentlemen, ladies, I'd like to
introduce you to Mr. Therman Murch,

01:29:14.721 --> 01:29:18.567
IRS auditor and master
of mind control.

01:29:18.658 --> 01:29:20.228
Therman?

01:29:25.899 --> 01:29:27.401
Sorry for my tardiness.

01:29:27.567 --> 01:29:30.070
Mr. Murch came by
the office last night.

01:29:30.170 --> 01:29:31.911
Shame to hear about that audit, Tim.

01:29:32.071 --> 01:29:34.278
Anything I can do to help,
I'm here for you.

01:29:35.675 --> 01:29:37.120
Barry, what are you doing here?

01:29:38.244 --> 01:29:39.018
I dunno.

01:29:39.345 --> 01:29:43.350
- You two know each other?
- Yes. We work together.

01:29:44.617 --> 01:29:46.654
I'm gonna have to get
the address of that office.

01:29:47.253 --> 01:29:50.757
So Therman was telling me about some
of his techniques for mind control,

01:29:50.857 --> 01:29:53.303
and I gotta say,
I was pretty blown away.

01:29:55.094 --> 01:29:59.941
Yes. The brain has pressure points,
just like any other muscle.

01:30:00.033 --> 01:30:01.774
Apply those pressure points,

01:30:01.935 --> 01:30:06.042
and the brain will
obey your every command.

01:30:06.372 --> 01:30:08.477
Allow me to demonstrate.

01:30:09.509 --> 01:30:10.715
Barry!

01:30:13.112 --> 01:30:14.352
Barry.

01:30:16.783 --> 01:30:18.353
Look into my eyes, Barry.

01:30:19.953 --> 01:30:21.193
Barry!

01:30:23.122 --> 01:30:25.227
Where is your wife, Barry?

01:30:26.960 --> 01:30:31.670
Tell us. Where is she?
Come on, Barry, tell us.

01:30:31.798 --> 01:30:37.248
- Your house?
- Yes.

01:30:43.309 --> 01:30:48.884
Let me just get this straight, Barry.
Your wife left you for him?

01:30:51.084 --> 01:30:54.065
She has extraordinary taste in men.

01:30:57.423 --> 01:31:02.372
And, tell us, Barry...
why did your wife leave you?

01:31:08.001 --> 01:31:11.175
- Spit it out of your mouth.
- No.

01:31:11.271 --> 01:31:12.944
- Say it!
- No.

01:31:13.706 --> 01:31:15.014
Say it, boy!

01:31:18.511 --> 01:31:20.354
I lost her clitoris.

01:31:22.682 --> 01:31:27.529
- That's right.
- You lost her clitoris?

01:31:27.620 --> 01:31:29.531
She got mad because I couldn't End it.

01:31:29.689 --> 01:31:33.034
- Well, you know.
- I said, "it's probably in your purse,"

01:31:33.126 --> 01:31:35.197
because nine times out of ten
when she loses something,

01:31:35.528 --> 01:31:36.871
that's where they end up.

01:31:36.963 --> 01:31:39.204
Barry, do you even
know what that is?

01:31:39.532 --> 01:31:41.808
I don't know what half
the stuff in her purse is.

01:31:41.935 --> 01:31:45.473
Well, don't worry, Barry. I found it.

01:31:45.605 --> 01:31:46.811
It was in her purse.

01:31:48.207 --> 01:31:49.914
It was in her naughty purse.

01:31:50.043 --> 01:31:54.116
Well, I mean, thank God
somebody found it, right?

01:31:56.049 --> 01:31:59.929
I thought I found it under the couch.

01:32:00.053 --> 01:32:02.761
Turns out it was just an
old piece of chewing gum.

01:32:19.105 --> 01:32:20.413
I release you!

01:32:24.110 --> 01:32:26.920
Ladies and gentlemen, mind control.

01:32:27.013 --> 01:32:28.856
Bravo.

01:32:28.982 --> 01:32:32.486
Bravo! Bravo!

01:32:36.589 --> 01:32:37.659
That was sweet.

01:32:41.027 --> 01:32:45.100
Barry, you're better than him.
Martha may not see it, but I do.

01:32:45.198 --> 01:32:48.873
Thanks. Thank you, Tim.
You're a good friend.

01:32:49.769 --> 01:32:51.840
- No, I'm not.
- Yeah, you are.

01:32:51.971 --> 01:32:57.182
I'm not. Barry, this... Man, this...

01:32:57.310 --> 01:32:59.620
This dinner isn't what you think it is.

01:33:01.447 --> 01:33:02.892
What?

01:33:03.016 --> 01:33:05.155
We invited you all here
to make fun of you.

01:33:07.553 --> 01:33:10.898
So you invite a bunch of
incredibly talented people to dinner

01:33:11.024 --> 01:33:15.996
- and you make fun of them?
- No. it's a dinner for idiots.

01:33:17.697 --> 01:33:20.041
Well, you'd better go ind some idiots.

01:33:20.700 --> 01:33:21.974
We do.

01:33:23.302 --> 01:33:28.149
I'm sorry. I...
Really, I'm so sorry.

01:33:29.976 --> 01:33:34.322
If it's any consolation,
Therman will probably win first prize.

01:33:38.518 --> 01:33:39.997
He'll have that, too.

01:33:40.086 --> 01:33:43.329
And he'll be able to lord it
over me for the rest of my life.

01:33:43.656 --> 01:33:46.660
Barry, Erst prize
is the biggest idiot.

01:33:46.826 --> 01:33:51.707
I know. That guy beats me
at everything. He just...

01:33:51.831 --> 01:33:56.007
I don't know, what's the use?
He has mind control, I don't.

01:33:59.338 --> 01:34:01.113
Barry, look at me.

01:34:03.609 --> 01:34:06.351
Therman has mind control, but you...

01:34:07.447 --> 01:34:12.692
- ...you have brain control.
- Brain control? What,,,?

01:34:12.785 --> 01:34:15.026
- You didn't know you had brain control?
- No.

01:34:15.121 --> 01:34:16.794
I knew it the second that I met you.

01:34:16.923 --> 01:34:19.369
You crawled in my brain,
and you stayed there.

01:34:19.459 --> 01:34:21.029
- I did?
- You did.

01:34:21.127 --> 01:34:23.437
And I can't get rid of you,
no matter how hard I try.

01:34:23.563 --> 01:34:28.137
You burrowed your way into my brain,
through my ear, like an earwig!

01:34:28.267 --> 01:34:31.043
- I didn't mean to.
- it's like you set up camp,

01:34:31.204 --> 01:34:34.310
- and I can't get you out of my head!
- I'm an earwig?

01:34:34.440 --> 01:34:37.421
Ifs like teeth and spikes and...

01:34:37.543 --> 01:34:42.390
...all your... spilling out millions
of earwig eggs all in my brain!

01:34:42.548 --> 01:34:44.994
- I can't do anything about it!
- Oh, my God!

01:34:45.118 --> 01:34:47.098
Brain control beats mind control
any day of the week!

01:34:47.220 --> 01:34:49.723
Because the brain
tells the mind what to do!

01:34:50.289 --> 01:34:54.101
You can beat this guy.
You can beat this guy, Barry.

01:34:54.894 --> 01:34:58.398
Barry, you can beat Therman.

01:34:58.498 --> 01:35:00.307
"You may say I'm a dreamer..."

01:35:02.235 --> 01:35:04.977
"But I'm not the only one..."

01:35:12.778 --> 01:35:15.088
I'm going to go lay eggs in his brain.

01:35:19.418 --> 01:35:23.457
- Back for more, Barry?
- Yes! I am, Therman.

01:35:23.589 --> 01:35:27.503
Only this time, I brought
my secret weapon... my brain.

01:35:30.096 --> 01:35:34.101
- What are you talking about?
- He's talking about brain control.

01:35:37.603 --> 01:35:41.380
Brain control? There ain't
no such thing as brain control.

01:35:41.507 --> 01:35:45.284
There is mind control.
Brain control is ridiculous.

01:35:45.378 --> 01:35:46.857
That's ridiculous.

01:35:48.047 --> 01:35:49.526
Yes, it's ridiculous.

01:35:49.649 --> 01:35:52.220
- That's ridiculous.
- Barry.

01:35:52.351 --> 01:35:53.352
Barry.

01:35:54.687 --> 01:36:00.228
- Barry.
- Barry.

01:36:00.359 --> 01:36:03.306
- What are you doing?
- Oh, my God.

01:36:03.462 --> 01:36:07.000
- It works.
- How are you doing that?

01:36:07.133 --> 01:36:09.841
I am making you say
everything that I say.

01:36:09.969 --> 01:36:11.346
Yeah, but I'm saying it first.

01:36:12.004 --> 01:36:13.312
- Are you?
- Yes!

01:36:13.406 --> 01:36:14.407
Really?

01:36:15.808 --> 01:36:18.345
I am very, very powerful.

01:36:19.712 --> 01:36:21.020
Oh, my gosh.

01:36:39.865 --> 01:36:41.276
- Oh, thank you,
- You're welcome.

01:36:44.837 --> 01:36:45.838
Oh, no!

01:36:58.851 --> 01:37:01.024
Best dinner ever.

01:37:01.187 --> 01:37:03.531
You have no secrets from me.

01:37:03.689 --> 01:37:07.193
Oh, contrary. You have
no secrets from me, Therman.

01:37:07.360 --> 01:37:11.866
I know that, after sex, you like
to curl up in the fecal position.

01:37:13.532 --> 01:37:16.376
You cry like a little baby.

01:37:16.535 --> 01:37:19.072
- Martha told you.
- No, she did not.

01:37:19.205 --> 01:37:24.052
I know that you take a magic marker
and you draw a face on your penis.

01:37:24.210 --> 01:37:26.588
Is that against the law?
I don't think so.

01:37:26.712 --> 01:37:30.489
And you put a little hat on it,
and you call it Sammy.

01:37:30.616 --> 01:37:32.562
Nobody is supposed to know that.

01:37:32.885 --> 01:37:35.923
- And you sing to it.
- You keep your mouth shut!

01:37:41.927 --> 01:37:44.430
That's... That's not 100 percent true.

01:37:44.563 --> 01:37:49.444
I know everything!
I have laid eggs inside of your brain.

01:37:49.568 --> 01:37:51.514
Get them out of my head!

01:37:51.837 --> 01:37:55.410
You are no longer in control
of me! I control you!

01:37:55.574 --> 01:38:00.580
And you are under my power.
I know everything, Therman.

01:38:01.814 --> 01:38:02.815
And I release you.

01:38:08.821 --> 01:38:11.301
Barry! Barry!

01:38:12.091 --> 01:38:13.161
Yeah!

01:38:14.093 --> 01:38:16.596
I hope that you have
all kept your receipts,

01:38:16.696 --> 01:38:19.176
because you will all be audited.

01:38:22.868 --> 01:38:26.315
He slept with Martha at my house!

01:38:26.439 --> 01:38:29.818
I was under the bed
the whole time. What an idiot!

01:38:31.610 --> 01:38:34.614
Right? I know!

01:38:34.947 --> 01:38:37.484
We have a little tradition,
here, at this dinner.

01:38:37.616 --> 01:38:42.031
We give an award to the evening's
most extraordinary person.

01:38:42.154 --> 01:38:46.569
Tonight's winner is the most
extraordinary person I have ever met.

01:38:46.892 --> 01:38:48.530
Our winner:

01:38:48.661 --> 01:38:49.867
Barry!

01:38:51.297 --> 01:38:52.799
Yeah!

01:38:57.970 --> 01:39:00.075
- We did it!
- Congratulations.

01:39:00.206 --> 01:39:01.207
Thank you.

01:39:01.340 --> 01:39:04.480
I look forward to working
with you, Mr. Conrad.

01:39:04.577 --> 01:39:08.650
Tim, Tim, you did it.
Your guy is amazing.

01:39:08.748 --> 01:39:10.022
Mueller loves him.

01:39:10.983 --> 01:39:12.656
He is amazing.

01:39:12.818 --> 01:39:14.729
- I thought you did such a great job.
- You're the winner?

01:39:14.854 --> 01:39:16.424
- I am, yeah!
- Whatever.

01:39:17.890 --> 01:39:20.427
And he deserves a hell
of a lot better than this.

01:39:20.559 --> 01:39:24.200
- They all do.
- What do you mean, exactly?

01:39:25.197 --> 01:39:29.339
Any one of you would throw me
under the bus for a bigger bonus.

01:39:29.502 --> 01:39:33.279
And Barry would throw himself
in front of a car to save a mouse...

01:39:33.406 --> 01:39:35.044
...even though it was already dead.

01:39:36.342 --> 01:39:39.221
I have been trying
to play on your team.

01:39:39.345 --> 01:39:42.622
Barry doesn't deserve that trophy. I do.

01:39:42.948 --> 01:39:45.929
Hold on a second.
Tim, I won this trophy fair and square.

01:39:46.051 --> 01:39:47.530
Barry, you don't want that trophy.

01:39:47.620 --> 01:39:50.100
- I've never won a trophy before.
-Yeah, I know, but...

01:39:50.222 --> 01:39:51.724
- You know what? Keep the trophy.
- OK.

01:39:51.857 --> 01:39:53.427
I'm sorry, What's going on here?

01:39:53.559 --> 01:39:57.200
Well, these people invited us here
to make fun of us.

01:39:57.296 --> 01:40:00.209
This is a contest for the biggest idiot.

01:40:00.366 --> 01:40:01.868
Which I nailed!

01:40:03.035 --> 01:40:04.708
Wait, wait, wait...

01:40:04.804 --> 01:40:07.045
-You told him?
-I did.

01:40:07.206 --> 01:40:10.085
It seems this contest was fixed.

01:40:10.209 --> 01:40:12.621
I thought you conducted
yourselves honorably.

01:40:12.745 --> 01:40:15.055
No, we do. We do.

01:40:15.147 --> 01:40:18.617
We do. Tim had a very
bright future here,

01:40:18.951 --> 01:40:22.398
but for some reason, he's chosen
to throw his lot in with the losers.

01:40:22.555 --> 01:40:25.502
Excuse me? I think I must
not have heard correctly.

01:40:25.624 --> 01:40:28.264
- Did he call us losers?
- He did.

01:40:28.961 --> 01:40:32.670
You insult my honor at great risk.
I will be leaving.

01:40:32.798 --> 01:40:35.745
Count yourself lucky
I have spared your life.

01:40:35.901 --> 01:40:37.244
Yeah!

01:40:42.241 --> 01:40:43.743
- Marco!
- Oh, God.

01:40:44.076 --> 01:40:47.614
So it is a tight you want, is it?
Well, you shall have your fight.

01:40:47.746 --> 01:40:49.248
But on my terms.

01:40:55.087 --> 01:40:59.263
In a world of complete darkness,
the sighted are blind...

01:40:59.358 --> 01:41:01.838
...but the blind can see.

01:41:04.830 --> 01:41:05.831
Oh, God.

01:41:06.932 --> 01:41:10.209
Welcome... to my world.

01:41:11.470 --> 01:41:14.383
I am invisible. Where am I?

01:41:14.507 --> 01:41:17.511
- He's good.
- I am a shadow...

01:41:17.643 --> 01:41:18.644
...with a big knife!

01:41:20.679 --> 01:41:23.523
- Simmer down!
- I can smell your fear!

01:41:24.717 --> 01:41:26.219
I think he's gonna kill someone.

01:41:28.220 --> 01:41:29.392
Over here!

01:41:29.522 --> 01:41:31.399
Hey, no! Not the boys!

01:41:31.524 --> 01:41:33.299
This has become a fiasco!

01:41:33.392 --> 01:41:35.497
Wait a second... the Swedish guy
who thinks he's a German!

01:41:35.628 --> 01:41:37.801
He's an idiot, too! Mueller!

01:41:38.797 --> 01:41:40.470
This is what you've
been up to all along!

01:41:40.566 --> 01:41:41.567
NO! NO!

01:41:41.700 --> 01:41:43.202
- You brought me hereto make fun!
- No...

01:41:43.335 --> 01:41:45.838
I can assure you.
I am no Unterschlagen!

01:41:50.809 --> 01:41:52.811
No, no! Lorenzo, no!

01:41:53.145 --> 01:41:55.386
- Somebody, grab the bird!
- I got it...

01:41:57.917 --> 01:41:59.692
No, no, no!

01:41:59.818 --> 01:42:02.560
It is my wife's favorite finger!
Please get it back now!

01:42:02.688 --> 01:42:05.498
Williams, get the bird!
Somebody kill the bird!

01:42:05.591 --> 01:42:07.070
- They're going to kill my bird!
- It's not his time!

01:42:07.192 --> 01:42:09.331
- It's over there!
- Don't hurt him!

01:42:09.428 --> 01:42:11.601
- Get the bird!
- Parry right, thrust left!

01:42:11.730 --> 01:42:13.835
You want the bird?
You have to kill me first!

01:42:14.166 --> 01:42:16.339
Fight like a blind man!
Kick him in the business center!

01:42:16.502 --> 01:42:17.674
Right here.

01:42:22.007 --> 01:42:23.680
- There's a Ere!
- Oh, come on!

01:42:23.776 --> 01:42:25.346
Grab the vulture!

01:42:26.345 --> 01:42:29.121
Somebody, just let the bird out!
Please! Just let him out!

01:42:29.248 --> 01:42:32.457
- Wait, I have an idea.
- Let Lorenzo out!

01:42:32.585 --> 01:42:35.589
You, stop! Don't move
or I'm gonna kill you.

01:42:36.522 --> 01:42:37.523
Allow me.

01:42:42.928 --> 01:42:44.032
There it is!

01:42:47.700 --> 01:42:48.974
Nice!

01:42:52.471 --> 01:42:53.472
Wanna?

01:42:54.640 --> 01:42:56.642
Great dinner!
Let's go get Julie!

01:42:57.876 --> 01:42:59.412
Mein linger!

01:43:02.982 --> 01:43:05.121
Don't you die on me!

01:43:10.255 --> 01:43:13.759
- Juilie! Julie?
- Julie?

01:43:13.892 --> 01:43:15.894
Julie?

01:43:16.562 --> 01:43:17.939
Tim.

01:43:27.306 --> 01:43:29.582
There's a way to read that
that’s actually positive.

01:43:29.742 --> 01:43:32.746
How? How is that positive, Barry?

01:43:34.313 --> 01:43:36.190
"Tim, have a ni..."

01:43:36.315 --> 01:43:37.919
"Hey, Tim, ha..."

01:43:38.250 --> 01:43:39.923
"Have a nice life."

01:43:41.620 --> 01:43:47.366
- This is my fault, isn't it?
- It's not. it's my fault.

01:43:47.493 --> 01:43:51.839
I'm the reason this happened. Not you.

01:43:51.964 --> 01:43:55.343
I messed up.
Want to hear something pathetic?

01:43:56.602 --> 01:43:58.206
God, yeah.

01:43:58.337 --> 01:44:00.544
You know why I wanted that promotion?

01:44:00.673 --> 01:44:03.279
So that Julie would think
that I was good enough for her.

01:44:03.976 --> 01:44:08.015
So stupid. I couldn't
believe that someone so amazing

01:44:08.147 --> 01:44:10.491
would want anything to do
with me. I tried to impress her...

01:44:10.616 --> 01:44:13.563
...with stuff she doesn't
care about, I don't care about.

01:44:14.853 --> 01:44:17.800
You know what I care about? Her.

01:44:18.957 --> 01:44:20.493
And what else?

01:44:20.626 --> 01:44:24.301
Waking up next to her every day,
seeing her every day.

01:44:24.463 --> 01:44:25.908
And more things?

01:44:26.231 --> 01:44:30.907
She's the greatest thing in my life,
and I blew it. God, I'm an idiot.

01:44:34.473 --> 01:44:35.645
What are you doing?

01:44:43.816 --> 01:44:45.523
Did you know I was listening?

01:44:45.651 --> 01:44:48.860
- No.
- I did. I did.

01:44:52.224 --> 01:44:54.329
I... I thought you'd gone.

01:44:55.728 --> 01:44:58.106
I left my phone.

01:44:59.498 --> 01:45:03.571
- Julie... I'm...
- Julie?

01:45:06.171 --> 01:45:08.515
We should hurry if we're
gonna catch that plane.

01:45:10.576 --> 01:45:14.217
- Kieran...
- Julie, I will handle this.

01:45:16.849 --> 01:45:20.296
Kieran... since the dawn
of ancient times,

01:45:20.419 --> 01:45:23.764
men and women have striven
to End the perfect mate.

01:45:23.889 --> 01:45:26.563
And, once in a while,
a couple will meet

01:45:26.692 --> 01:45:29.468
and spark a passion
that is so powerful,

01:45:29.595 --> 01:45:33.543
a thousand armies
could not pull them apart.

01:45:33.699 --> 01:45:35.872
That is what you have with Julie.

01:45:36.702 --> 01:45:38.477
But Tim got there first.

01:45:38.604 --> 01:45:40.982
And if Julie leaves, ii will kill him.

01:45:42.441 --> 01:45:44.887
People can die of broken hearts.

01:45:45.043 --> 01:45:47.546
I know. It almost happened to me.

01:45:48.313 --> 01:45:53.786
And because of that...
you may see Julie no more.

01:45:54.620 --> 01:45:57.760
You may talk to Julie no more.

01:45:57.890 --> 01:46:03.067
You may look upon
Julie's face... no more.

01:46:03.162 --> 01:46:05.938
OK, but we work together, so...

01:46:06.064 --> 01:46:08.510
What part of "no more"
do you not understand?

01:46:08.634 --> 01:46:09.942
We had a talk, Kieran and I,

01:46:10.068 --> 01:46:12.912
and he understands
it's purely professional.

01:46:13.071 --> 01:46:17.315
- There is professional no more.
- He's right, Julie.

01:46:18.744 --> 01:46:23.853
If we start this tire...
we'll burn this world to ashes.

01:46:23.982 --> 01:46:28.021
- What are you talking about?
- If you start this Ere...

01:46:30.255 --> 01:46:33.259
- Burn it to ashes.
- ...burn this world to ashes.

01:46:34.760 --> 01:46:38.799
- There goes my museum show.
- Welcome to my world.

01:46:38.931 --> 01:46:42.435
- Yeah.
- Julie...

01:46:42.534 --> 01:46:46.311
...I love you. I don't care
if we get married. I'll stop asking.

01:46:48.106 --> 01:46:49.642
Don't stop asking.

01:47:04.456 --> 01:47:08.836
- You are a wise man, my friend.
- As are you.

01:47:17.970 --> 01:47:20.974
Au revoir Julie.
Au revoir Tim.

01:47:21.139 --> 01:47:22.880
Au revoir Kieran.

01:47:25.410 --> 01:47:28.516
Be kind to your birds and your goats!

01:47:42.995 --> 01:47:45.168
We're gonna be so happy together!

01:47:53.272 --> 01:47:56.515
I guess things
really do happen for a reason.

01:47:56.675 --> 01:47:59.178
Tim lost his job, but the
two of us remain best friends.

01:47:59.511 --> 01:48:03.687
And once a month, I invite him
to a gathering I hast.

01:48:03.782 --> 01:48:07.127
It's called The Breakfast of Champions.

01:48:08.887 --> 01:48:10.867
Kieran and I became friends.

01:48:11.023 --> 01:48:12.627
He asked me to collaborate with him,

01:48:12.758 --> 01:48:15.068
and we showed our work
ah' over the world...

01:48:15.193 --> 01:48:17.639
...including South Africa.

01:48:17.763 --> 01:48:19.800
And guess who came to see us?

01:48:19.932 --> 01:48:21.536
Morgan Freeman.

01:48:24.903 --> 01:48:28.214
Tim went on to help Martin Mueller
convert his munitions factory

01:48:28.307 --> 01:48:30.719
into the Martin Mueller
Museum of Modem Art...

01:48:30.876 --> 01:48:31.946
...or

01:48:35.213 --> 01:48:38.319
Kieran and I collaborated
on a sculpture for the opening.

01:48:44.089 --> 01:48:47.901
I met up with Darla again.
Boy, does she like role playing.

01:48:48.060 --> 01:48:51.667
She had me play detective,
and she left all of these clues.

01:48:51.797 --> 01:48:53.003
And you know what?

01:48:53.899 --> 01:48:55.503
I found it.

01:48:58.904 --> 01:49:00.781
Therman wrote a new book.

01:49:00.906 --> 01:49:03.512
And it is very popular in some circles.

01:49:05.077 --> 01:49:09.321
I guess it's true what they say...
"A mind is a terrible thing. "

01:49:13.618 --> 01:49:18.089
Oh, yeah, as for Tim and Julie...
Well, Julie finally said yes.

01:49:18.256 --> 01:49:20.600
They went to Paris for the honeymoon.

01:49:20.692 --> 01:49:24.765
I waited around to surprise them,
but it never felt like the right time.

01:49:26.198 --> 01:49:28.269
Anyway, i can tell you this:

01:49:28.834 --> 01:49:31.178
They both got curated..

01:49:31.303 --> 01:49:32.611
...several times.

01:53:21.600 --> 01:53:25.173
Oh, yeah... Fenders company
went out of business.

01:53:25.337 --> 01:53:29.046
Forbes Magazine named him
Wall Streets biggest loser!

01:53:29.174 --> 01:53:31.381
Way to go, Fender!
