Hi, Mom.
- Hi, honey.

06:10.286 --> 06:12.121
So good to have you home.
- Hey, Dad, Merry Christmas.

06:12.205 --> 06:13.581
How is everyone?
- Great.

06:13.664 --> 06:15.917
- Go and sit down.
- Wow, it looks beautiful.

06:16.000 --> 06:17.251
- You look great, honey.
- Have a seat, Daniel.

06:17.335 --> 06:18.628
- So, Daniel,
how was your trip?

06:18.711 --> 06:21.130
How was the--
- The lodge?

06:21.214 --> 06:25.176
- Well, it went very good.
I ultimately--

06:25.259 --> 06:26.594
- Where have you been,
by the way?

06:26.677 --> 06:28.012
- I haven't seen--
- Where you been?

06:28.096 --> 06:30.640
- Wait, who are you, again?
- Oh, man.

06:30.723 --> 06:33.101
So ultimately, I had two
beautiful young ladies,

06:33.184 --> 06:35.436
and I had to choose one
of them to bring home.

06:35.520 --> 06:37.021
Their names are
Nicci and Brooke.

06:37.105 --> 06:38.773
And you know, Brooke was,
like, a total sweetheart.

06:38.856 --> 06:41.484
The thing is, she came,
like, a week before Christmas,

06:41.567 --> 06:43.402
so I didn't have,
like, that much time

06:43.486 --> 06:45.279
to spend with her,
but as we spent time,

06:45.363 --> 06:47.240
we had, like, a really,
you know, total connection.

06:47.323 --> 06:48.991
Like, she was funny.
She was cute.

06:49.075 --> 06:50.368
The jokes would
go back and forth.

06:50.451 --> 06:52.453
Like, she'd fit perfectly
into the family.

06:52.537 --> 06:53.955
So I developed, like,

06:54.038 --> 06:55.957
a relationship
with her really quickly.

06:56.040 --> 06:57.458
But the other girl,
you know, Nicci,

06:57.542 --> 06:59.043
that I'd known for a while,

06:59.127 --> 07:00.795
you know,
we got along really great too.

07:00.878 --> 07:03.339
So it came down to the end,
and I was, like, wasn't sure

07:03.422 --> 07:05.550
what decision I was gonna make,
and I picked, you know, Nicci,

07:05.633 --> 07:07.218
and I'm really excited
for you guys to meet her.

07:07.301 --> 07:08.636
You know, she's a great girl.

07:08.719 --> 07:10.054
- How did you find
which one to choose?

07:10.138 --> 07:11.681
What was the ultimate
deciding factor?

07:11.764 --> 07:13.516
- It was--ultimately, it was,
like, the comfort level,

07:13.599 --> 07:15.977
you know, the fact
that I knew Nicci better.

07:16.060 --> 07:18.646
I'd spent more time with her.
She wants a family.

07:18.729 --> 07:20.398
She's looking
for a serious relationship.

07:20.481 --> 07:22.358
And one other thing,
she's, like, good at pool.

07:22.441 --> 07:24.443
She's good at sports.
Like, she's athletic.

07:24.527 --> 07:26.070
- Oh, that's good.

07:26.154 --> 07:28.990
Daniel, I would say, has
always been a people pleaser.

07:29.073 --> 07:32.618
Sometimes he will give in
to something

07:32.702 --> 07:34.871
that maybe doesn't really work.

07:34.954 --> 07:37.832
I would just hate to see
Daniel make the same mistake

07:37.915 --> 07:39.750
<i>of appeasing somebody</i>

07:39.834 --> 07:42.503

<i>And sometimes, I do feel like</i>
<i>I need to be tough,</i>

07:44.422 --> 07:45.756
<i>and I need to be</i>
<i>a little critical.</i>

07:45.840 --> 07:48.718
And I just wanna see him
find the one

07:48.801 --> 07:50.094
that he lights up about.

07:50.178 --> 07:51.512
Dad, how excited would you be

07:51.596 --> 07:53.389
if one of your sons
finally got married?

07:53.472 --> 07:54.599
- That would be
an answered prayer.

07:54.682 --> 07:55.850

07:55.933 --> 07:57.226
Eight of you
and only one is married.

07:57.310 --> 08:00.563
So if she passes the test

09:24.522 --> 09:26.607

09:26.691 --> 09:27.942

- Thank you.

09:28.025 --> 09:29.277
- Jared.
- Hi.

09:29.360 --> 09:30.945
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

09:31.028 --> 09:33.197
- Nice to meet you.
- Oh, look at the little sign.

09:33.281 --> 09:35.074
"Merry Christmas,
Amanda and Hina."

09:35.157 --> 09:36.993
- Aww, that's so cute.

09:37.076 --> 09:38.411
- That's all her.
- Aw, Glori.

09:38.494 --> 09:39.787
- Yeah, Glori made it.

09:39.870 --> 09:41.455
- I wouldn't do that.

09:41.539 --> 09:43.541
- Yeah, that's a very
Glori thing to do.

09:43.624 --> 09:46.502
- I agree.
Merry Christmas to you.

09:46.586 --> 09:48.546
- You're not saying
not merry Christmas.

09:48.629 --> 09:49.922
You're not saying
bad Christmas.

09:50.006 --> 09:51.465
- I'm not against the sign.
- Yeah.

09:51.549 --> 09:53.634
- I heard that you're
the hardest to shop for.

09:53.718 --> 09:55.886
- Hey, look.
- Is that true?

09:55.970 --> 09:58.306
- Aww, reindeer.
- Oh, it's so cute.

09:58.389 --> 10:00.266
- Look what it says.
- Oh, deer, oh, deer.

10:00.349 --> 10:02.059
- You got me this shirt
for Christmas like ten years--

10:02.143 --> 10:03.477
- Oh, I did?
- Yeah.

10:03.561 --> 10:04.895
[laughter]

10:04.979 --> 10:06.564
- Did you really?

10:06.647 --> 10:10.985
- So far, I can definitely see
why Amanda likes Hina.

10:11.068 --> 10:12.528
I crack a lot of jokes,

10:12.611 --> 10:14.488
and it's nice when someone
can crack them back.

10:14.572 --> 10:17.742
<i>So I'm definitely looking</i>
<i>forward to get to talk</i>

10:17.825 --> 10:19.160
<i>with Amanda</i>
<i>a little bit more,</i>

10:19.243 --> 10:20.828
kind of digging in
and being like,

10:20.911 --> 10:22.663
"What is all of this
even about?"

10:22.747 --> 10:25.833
I know you were kind of
dating a few people.

10:25.916 --> 10:27.960
How did you end up
in our kitchen here?

10:28.044 --> 10:29.378
- Good question.

10:29.462 --> 10:31.714
Amanda, how did I end up
being in here?

10:31.797 --> 10:33.966
- So Hina's here with us
right now

10:34.050 --> 10:37.720
because Hina is the person
that I connected with the most.

10:37.803 --> 10:39.180
It was just easy.
- Yeah.

10:39.263 --> 10:40.431
- Did you guys have any bumps
in the road

10:40.514 --> 10:42.183
that you had to work through?

10:42.266 --> 10:43.684
- Bumpy time, USA.

10:43.768 --> 10:46.729
We were speed bumping
all around, bump here,

10:46.812 --> 10:48.689
bump there, bump here.

10:48.773 --> 10:52.401
<i>- My siblings know that Hina</i>
<i>and I are moving very slowly</i>

10:52.485 --> 10:54.695
'cause we have hit some bumps.

10:54.779 --> 10:58.032
And there's some things
that I'm still working through,

10:58.115 --> 11:00.576
but we're still moving forward
in the direction of us.

11:00.659 --> 11:03.704
- It was, like, hard
because Amanda wasn't finding

11:03.788 --> 11:06.999
a romantic connection
with anybody, myself included.

11:07.083 --> 11:09.960
So, you know, I was like,
"Amanda, hello."

11:10.044 --> 11:11.670
Like, "Why aren't you
in love with me?"

11:11.754 --> 11:13.547
- Yeah.
[laughter]

11:13.631 --> 11:14.757
- Well, I mean--

11:14.840 --> 11:16.342
- For a long time,

11:16.425 --> 11:20.262
Amanda was searching
for a committed relationship.

11:20.346 --> 11:25.434
And she's gone through enough
to get hurt, really hurt.

11:25.518 --> 11:29.230
So we're open
but also protective.

12:44.305 --> 12:46.348

12:46.432 --> 12:47.933
I've never been

12:48.017 --> 12:49.435

12:49.518 --> 12:50.853

- Florida Christmas.

12:50.936 --> 12:53.147

12:53.230 --> 12:54.315

I'm from California,

12:54.398 --> 12:55.858

12:57.818 --> 12:58.861

13:00.237 --> 13:02.114
You know,
I think meeting all of you is,

13:02.198 --> 13:03.616
like, a huge step.

13:03.699 --> 13:06.160
And to me, I don't bring
anyone home for the holidays

13:06.243 --> 13:07.828
unless it's, like, a big deal.

13:07.912 --> 13:10.414
So, you know, it's a little
nerve-racking at times,

13:10.498 --> 13:12.291
but we're just gonna breathe.

13:12.374 --> 13:13.834
- Well, that's a big step

13:13.918 --> 13:16.337
for you to be away
from your family for Christmas.

13:16.420 --> 13:17.922
- Yes, it is.

13:18.005 --> 13:20.591
- So we appreciate that you
were willing to come

13:20.674 --> 13:23.010

a very special holiday with us.

13:23.093 --> 13:25.179
- Well, thank you.
I'm super grateful for it.

13:25.262 --> 13:27.181
- Nicci seems like
a very nice girl.

13:27.264 --> 13:29.475
I think she, you know,
carries herself well,

13:29.558 --> 13:30.851
and she'll get along with,

13:30.935 --> 13:32.853
you know,
the other girls in the family,

13:32.937 --> 13:35.940
which are sometimes
hard to accommodate.

13:36.023 --> 13:37.441
But then again,
I like to be optimistic,

13:37.525 --> 13:38.859
so we'll see what happens.

13:38.943 --> 13:40.361
- I heard all about you guys.

13:40.444 --> 13:43.322
I mean,
you definitely are a soldier.

13:43.405 --> 13:45.616
Like, you're amazing
for having eight children,

13:45.699 --> 13:46.951
and you look fantastic.

13:47.034 --> 13:48.118
- Oh, thank you.
- Yeah, one too many.

13:48.202 --> 13:51.288
- My dad's like, "Thank you."

13:51.372 --> 13:53.207
- Do you want to have
a lot of kids?

13:53.290 --> 13:55.042
- Yeah, I wanna have
at least three.

13:55.125 --> 13:56.377
- Oh, yeah, that's a lot.
- Yes.

13:56.460 --> 13:58.128
Family is everything to me.

13:58.212 --> 14:00.339
My parents have been married
41 years.

14:00.422 --> 14:01.465
- Oh.

14:01.549 --> 14:02.716
- Aww.
- Yeah.

14:02.800 --> 14:03.884
- Awesome.
- Aww.

14:03.968 --> 14:05.678
- That's awesome.
- That's fun.

14:05.761 --> 14:09.056
- I'm definitely the toughest
when it comes to my sisters.

14:09.139 --> 14:12.560
Nicci seems very
put together and classy,

14:12.643 --> 14:16.397
but I personally feel like
I see Daniel with somebody

14:16.480 --> 14:18.482
a little bit more edgy,
honestly.

14:18.566 --> 14:19.942
<i>Nicci does seem sweet.</i>

14:20.025 --> 14:22.570
I just don't know

17:14.867 --> 17:17.578
Brooke really let me know
how she felt,

17:17.661 --> 17:21.415
and it impacted me.

17:21.498 --> 17:22.791
I was unpacking,

17:22.875 --> 17:27.588
and Brooke put a letter
in my suitcase.

17:37.806 --> 17:39.475
Yeah, there was something
with Brooke

17:39.558 --> 17:43.771

I've, like, rarely had.

18:27.940 --> 18:29.525
When I read this from Brooke,

18:29.608 --> 18:31.693
it just brought me back
to that moment and realizing,

18:31.777 --> 18:35.322
like, I was making a choice
that I couldn't take back.

18:35.405 --> 18:36.907
- Is there any part of you

18:36.990 --> 18:40.244
that's regretting your decision
to bring Nicci home?

18:40.327 --> 18:43.163
- Like, I wanted to get
to know Brooke more.

18:43.247 --> 18:45.374
A part of me wonders if I had
the same amount of time

18:45.457 --> 18:46.750

18:46.834 --> 18:48.502
what choice I would have made,
you know?

18:48.585 --> 18:50.838
- You probably should
reach out to Brooke

18:50.921 --> 18:53.340
and maybe kind of figure out
what is going on there.

18:53.423 --> 18:55.759
Because if you're feeling
a certain way about her

18:55.843 --> 18:59.179
and you're bringing another
girl home to meet your family,

18:59.263 --> 19:01.014
you probably have
some unsettled business,

19:01.098 --> 19:02.683

19:09.147 --> 19:11.984
So I would love
to see him explore that

19:12.067 --> 19:15.028
because I just see that,
obviously, it's bothering him

19:15.112 --> 19:16.697
and that he does have
feelings for her.

19:16.780 --> 19:17.990
Does Nicci know?

19:18.073 --> 19:19.575

19:21.451 --> 19:22.744
- No, I think I need...
- No.

22:43.612 --> 22:44.821

22:44.905 --> 22:46.281
- In the past,
he's been hurt too,

22:46.365 --> 22:48.075
just because he does have
a tendency to,
