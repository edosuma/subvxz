00:01.001 --> 00:09.041
â™ª

00:09.043 --> 00:11.343
Oh, Sassy Saddles,
don't you just love

00:11.345 --> 00:14.480
my new Femme Mystique
Chic line of gowns?

00:14.482 --> 00:17.616
Sequins and sashes,
Rarity, they're exquisite!

00:17.618 --> 00:20.285
Where in Equestria did
you find the inspiration?

00:20.287 --> 00:24.656
Ooh. I modeled them after The
Adventures of Shadow Spade.

00:24.658 --> 00:27.726
Her stories are always full
of mystery and suspense.

00:27.728 --> 00:30.429
And best of all?
Fabulous costumes!

00:31.631 --> 00:33.565
They're perfect.

00:33.567 --> 00:34.633
What are you doing?

00:36.603 --> 00:38.570
Oh, uh, just making
some minor adjustments.

00:38.572 --> 00:41.774
â™ª

00:41.776 --> 00:43.675
Shadow Spade believes
it all comes down

00:43.677 --> 00:46.345
to attention to
detail. And so do I.

00:47.714 --> 00:50.115
There! Now it's perfect!

00:51.317 --> 00:52.184
Hey guys! How's it--

00:52.186 --> 00:53.285
[crash]

00:53.287 --> 00:54.820
[whimpers]

00:54.822 --> 00:58.157
Heh heh heh. My bad!

01:01.694 --> 01:05.264
<i>â™ª My little pony,</i>
<i>my little pony â™ª</i>

01:05.266 --> 01:07.199
<i>â™ª Aaaahhh </i>

01:07.201 --> 01:09.268
<i>â™ª My little Pony </i>

01:09.270 --> 01:11.637
<i>â™ª I used to wonder what</i>
<i>friendship could be. â™ª</i>

01:11.639 --> 01:13.539
<i>â™ª My Little Pony </i>

01:13.541 --> 01:16.175
<i>â™ª Until you all shared</i>
<i>its magic with me. â™ª</i>

01:16.177 --> 01:18.210
<i>â™ª Big adventure! </i>
<i>â™ª Tons of fun </i>

01:18.212 --> 01:20.345
<i>â™ª A beautiful heart!  â™ª</i>
<i>Faithful and strong! â™ª</i>

01:20.347 --> 01:22.514
<i>â™ª Sharing kindness </i>
<i>â™ª it's an easy feat </i>

01:22.516 --> 01:24.516
<i>â™ª And magic makes it</i>
<i>all complete! â™ª</i>

01:24.518 --> 01:26.618
<i>â™ª To have my little pony </i>

01:26.620 --> 01:30.155
<i>â™ª Do you know you're all</i>
<i>my very best friends? â™ª</i>

01:30.157 --> 01:31.857
â™ª

01:36.696 --> 01:39.465
Sorry I messed up
your dress thingie.

01:41.267 --> 01:43.268
Nothing we can't
fix in a stitch.

01:43.270 --> 01:45.537
What are you doing
in Canterlot?

01:45.539 --> 01:48.407
I'm here for Princess Celestia's
Royal Garden Opening tomorrow.

01:48.409 --> 01:50.209
Oh, yes.

01:50.211 --> 01:53.645
Rumor has it the gardens are
especially lush this season.

01:53.647 --> 01:56.148
I've heard that the Wonderbolts
will be kicking things off

01:56.150 --> 01:58.250
with an aerial display.

01:58.252 --> 01:59.852
You heard right.

01:59.854 --> 02:01.753
And Rainbow Dash is
here to fly with them.

02:01.755 --> 02:03.489
So exciting!

02:03.491 --> 02:07.326
Well, kind of exciting.
Technically I'm not flying.

02:07.328 --> 02:09.394
I'm just the lucky
reserve who was called in

02:09.396 --> 02:12.131
to be the back-up flier in case
a Wonderbolt can't perform.

02:12.133 --> 02:14.266
Oh, don't be so modest!

02:14.268 --> 02:17.136
Out of all the reserves,
you were the one chosen.

02:17.138 --> 02:18.871
It is pretty sweet.

02:18.873 --> 02:20.839
And I do get to
stay in the castle,

02:20.841 --> 02:22.274
hang out with
the Wonderbolts,

02:22.276 --> 02:24.810
and eat awesome food
at the dinner tonight!

02:24.812 --> 02:27.412
Speaking of the dinner,
you're still coming right?

02:27.414 --> 02:29.148
Heavens yes!

02:29.150 --> 02:31.550
A chance to dress up, be
charming and show off

02:31.552 --> 02:34.219
my newest femme
mystique couture?

02:34.221 --> 02:36.588
I wouldn't miss it
for all of Equestia.

02:36.590 --> 02:38.223
Great. See you tonight!

02:38.225 --> 02:38.924
[slam]

02:38.926 --> 02:40.826
[rumbling]

02:43.263 --> 02:44.596
[crash]

02:46.833 --> 02:49.168
Ooh, the rhinestones
I ordered!

02:51.638 --> 02:54.940
Oh, my, oh, there's
been a mistake!

02:54.942 --> 02:58.911
I ordered dragon cut stones
and these are hoof-polished.

02:58.913 --> 03:01.747
I'm sorry, but I've got a full
load of deliveries today.

03:01.749 --> 03:03.882
I'm not sure I have
time to redo your order.

03:08.421 --> 03:12.724
[sweetly] Of course you don't!
Your job is so difficult.

03:12.726 --> 03:16.929
Honestly, I don't know how you
keep all those orders straight!

03:16.931 --> 03:22.634
It is pretty tough, what with
the boxes all being box-shaped.

03:22.636 --> 03:26.538
Oh, yes, and I very
much appreciate it.

03:26.540 --> 03:28.774
But if there was any
way you could squeeze in

03:28.776 --> 03:32.644
one more little delivery, I
would be eternally grateful.

03:36.249 --> 03:39.851
Ha ha ha. Well, for you,
Rarity, I'll see what I can do.

03:42.322 --> 03:45.791
Rarity, you could sweet
talk a filly out of candy!

03:45.793 --> 03:49.761
Oh, it was nothing. No
pony minds a compliment!

03:49.763 --> 03:52.998
Now, you simply must help me
pick out an outfit for tonight.

03:53.000 --> 03:54.800
Something from the new
collection, of course.

03:56.803 --> 04:07.946
[crowd chatter]

04:07.948 --> 04:09.248
Let's grab some grub!

04:14.020 --> 04:18.323
[sniffing] Mmmmm. Is that
Juniper Phoenix I smell?

04:18.325 --> 04:19.925
No, it's broccoli!

04:21.761 --> 04:25.664
Yeah, Juniper Phoenix is one of
<i>my favorite stallion colognes.</i>

04:25.666 --> 04:29.401
Mine as well. It's
masculine, and yet soft,

04:29.403 --> 04:31.536
with the barest hint of
floral notes and a --

04:31.538 --> 04:33.972
Rarity, don't you
know who this is?

04:33.974 --> 04:38.910
â™ª

04:38.912 --> 04:42.547
A gentlepony with fabulous
taste in colognes and scarves?

04:42.549 --> 04:45.517
It's Wind Rider!

04:45.519 --> 04:47.753
Oh! So nice to meet you.

04:47.755 --> 04:51.023
You didn't let me finish!
He's a living legend!

04:51.025 --> 04:54.026
He holds the Wonderbolt record
in the Mustang Marathon.

04:54.028 --> 04:56.795
Well, that was a
long time ago.

04:56.797 --> 04:59.865
Honestly, I can't believe
I still hold the record.

04:59.867 --> 05:02.534
Wind Rider, I see
you met Rainbow Dash!

05:02.536 --> 05:05.037
She's one of our most
promising reserves.

05:05.039 --> 05:07.072
She just might
beat your record!

05:07.074 --> 05:08.540
Really now?

05:08.542 --> 05:11.410
Oh, I'm nowhere
near as good as you.

05:11.412 --> 05:13.879
I mean I'm fast, but I
don't have the endurance

05:13.881 --> 05:15.914
to go long distances.

05:15.916 --> 05:18.383
Don't be modest.
A little practice

05:18.385 --> 05:20.352
and you'll be beating
records in no time.

05:21.788 --> 05:25.390
Heh heh. Well, it's nice
to meet you fillies.

05:25.392 --> 05:28.360
[sigh] Not as nice as
it is to meet you, sir.

05:30.496 --> 05:33.432
I can't believe I
just met Wind Rider!

05:33.434 --> 05:35.400
Yeah. He's coming
out of retirement

05:35.402 --> 05:37.703
to take the spot of honor
in the center of our

05:37.705 --> 05:39.638
aerial flower
formation tomorrow!

05:39.640 --> 05:42.874
Really? That's incredible!

05:42.876 --> 05:47.679
â™ª

05:47.681 --> 05:49.981
Guess I'll just watch
Wind Rider being awesome

05:49.983 --> 05:51.817
from the sidelines.

05:51.819 --> 05:54.853
Practice tomorrow is
gonna be so boring.

05:54.855 --> 05:57.622
I don't suppose I
could keep you company?

05:57.624 --> 05:59.358
You could!

05:59.360 --> 06:00.992
They always let friends and
family come watch practices.

06:01.994 --> 06:04.129
Oh!

06:04.131 --> 06:06.765
Sorry about that. Let
me help clean that up.

06:08.601 --> 06:12.003
No no. It's almost impossible
to get stains out of silk.

06:12.005 --> 06:13.071
But not to worry...

06:15.641 --> 06:16.908
I've come prepared.

06:21.047 --> 06:25.484
That dinner was absolutely
divine! Thanks for inviting me.

06:25.486 --> 06:27.953
Ooh! You're staying
in the east tower?

06:27.955 --> 06:30.555
Those rooms have the
best view of Canterlot.

06:30.557 --> 06:32.124
How lucky are we?

06:32.126 --> 06:34.860
Well, we better get some
shuteye before practice.

06:36.095 --> 06:37.629
See you tomorrow, Rarity!

06:37.631 --> 06:38.797
Good night!

06:40.633 --> 06:47.739
â™ª

06:47.741 --> 06:50.409
Thanks for keeping
me company, Rarity.

06:50.411 --> 06:51.743
If you weren't here...

06:51.745 --> 06:54.146
well, I don't know who I'd
be talking to right now.

06:56.416 --> 06:58.450
You'd be talking to me.

06:58.452 --> 07:00.919
Rainbow Dash, Spitfire's
mom sent a message

07:00.921 --> 07:03.922
that she was sick. She had to
leave to take care of her.

07:03.924 --> 07:07.426
Oh, no! I hope her mom's OK!

07:07.428 --> 07:12.164
Me too. In the meantime, we
need you to fly in her place.

07:12.166 --> 07:15.567
L-l-like in the actual show?

07:15.569 --> 07:18.103
Unless Spitfire comes back, yes.

07:18.105 --> 07:20.872
I won't let you down, Soarin!

07:20.874 --> 07:24.943
AAAAH! This is the
best thing EVERRR!

07:24.945 --> 07:27.712
Oh, my gosh oh my gosh
oh my gosh oh my gosh!

07:27.714 --> 07:31.483
â™ª I'm gonna get to fly with Wind
<i>Rider! And the Wonderbolts! â™ª</i>

07:31.485 --> 07:35.086
â™ª Cause I'm the bestest! And I'm
<i>awesome! And they know it! â™ª</i>

07:35.088 --> 07:36.922
Uhhh. Rainbow Dash?

07:36.924 --> 07:38.523
Sh sh. Let her
have this, darling.

07:43.696 --> 07:52.671
â™ª

07:52.673 --> 07:54.840
Hello, there. Friend or family?

07:54.842 --> 07:57.476
Family. My daughter's
a Wonderbolt.

07:57.478 --> 08:00.779
But I don't see her up
there. Do you know Spitfire?

08:00.781 --> 08:04.716
Oh, you're Spitfire's mom?
But I thought you were sick!

08:04.718 --> 08:05.917
What?

08:05.919 --> 08:07.619
Well, Spitfire got
a note from you

08:07.621 --> 08:08.920
saying you weren't
feeling well

08:08.922 --> 08:10.856
and she went home
to take care of you!

08:10.858 --> 08:12.123
I didn't send a note.

08:12.125 --> 08:14.593
That's so strange.

08:14.595 --> 08:17.762
Stormy Flare? Aren't you
supposed to be sick?

08:17.764 --> 08:23.535
I don't know, but I do know I
didn't send my daughter a note.

08:23.537 --> 08:26.671
Could somepony have sent
Spitfire a fake note?

08:26.673 --> 08:28.507
Who would do such a thing?

08:28.509 --> 08:31.510
Somepony who wanted her
out of the show, I suppose.

08:31.512 --> 08:33.278
Why would anypony want that?

08:33.280 --> 08:35.947
Maybe so that they
could take her spot.

08:35.949 --> 08:40.185
â™ª

08:43.856 --> 08:46.992
Me? I would never
do that to Spitfire.

08:46.994 --> 08:48.994
Why would you think it was me?

08:48.996 --> 08:51.830
I did see you and Spitfire
leave the dinner together.

08:51.832 --> 08:53.798
We were room neighbors
in the castle!

08:53.800 --> 08:57.569
And you did say you would do
anything to fly with Wind Rider!

08:57.571 --> 09:00.539
Yeah, but I didn't
mean anything!

09:00.541 --> 09:02.240
Spitfire came by my room

09:02.242 --> 09:05.076
and told me she had to go see
her mom at around midnight.

09:05.078 --> 09:07.312
Where were you then?

09:07.314 --> 09:11.283
I was asleep at midnight, having
this totally amazing dream.

09:11.285 --> 09:14.319
There I was at the arena,
flying with Wind Rider

09:14.321 --> 09:16.888
and the Wonderbolts, like
I've always wanted to--

09:18.824 --> 09:21.793
Never mind. Not helping.

09:21.795 --> 09:26.097
[accusing whispers]

09:26.099 --> 09:29.301
Rainbow Dash, if you can prove
that somepony else is behind

09:29.303 --> 09:32.637
Spitfire's disappearance
before the start of the show,

09:32.639 --> 09:34.773
then you can still fly with us.

09:34.775 --> 09:37.142
In the meantime,
Misty Fly, Blaze,

09:37.144 --> 09:39.945
head over to Stormy Flare's
house and try to find Spitfire

09:39.947 --> 09:41.046
and bring her back.

09:42.748 --> 09:45.784
I have to warn you, if
you sent that letter,

09:45.786 --> 09:48.320
the bylaws are clear;
I'd have no choice

09:48.322 --> 09:52.691
but to ban you from the
Wonderbolts forever. Understand?

09:52.693 --> 09:54.259
[sigh]

09:54.261 --> 09:57.696
I understand. But how am I gonna
prove I didn't send a letter

09:57.698 --> 09:59.598
that I didn't send?

09:59.600 --> 10:00.899
With me!

10:00.901 --> 10:02.667
<i>â™ª [piano jazz] </i>

10:02.669 --> 10:04.736
Detective Rarity is on the case!

10:04.738 --> 10:06.871
And we're going to get
to the bottom of this

10:06.873 --> 10:08.940
faster than my
costume change!

10:08.942 --> 10:11.109
Yeah, what's
with the get-up?

10:11.111 --> 10:14.045
Obviously, I am
channeling Shadow Spade

10:14.047 --> 10:15.714
through these
gorgeous garments.

10:15.716 --> 10:17.916
And she would say that
the best way to prove

10:17.918 --> 10:20.652
that you didn't send the letter
is to find out whoever did!

10:20.654 --> 10:23.254
First stop, the
scene of the crime!

10:23.256 --> 10:27.125
â™ª

10:27.127 --> 10:29.961
Rarity: We had a long road ahead
<i>of us, Rainbow Dash and I.</i>

10:29.963 --> 10:32.364
<i>Well, not too long because</i>
<i>we didn't have much time</i>

10:32.366 --> 10:35.767
<i>but the point is, I was</i>
<i>up for the challenge.</i>

10:42.008 --> 10:45.043
There I was, surveying
the crime scene

10:45.045 --> 10:46.878
and looking tres
chic while doing it.

10:51.250 --> 10:54.319
This must be the envelope
for the letter Spitfire got!

10:54.321 --> 10:55.420
[sniff sniff]

10:58.124 --> 11:02.961
Hmm, these look like
hairs from a rainbow mane!

11:02.963 --> 11:04.929
[gulp] That's not good.

11:07.800 --> 11:09.768
Rainbow Dash was getting antsy.

11:09.770 --> 11:11.703
<i>But I had faith I</i>
<i>could clear her name</i>

11:11.705 --> 11:14.039
<i>and find the real culprit.</i>

11:14.041 --> 11:15.440
What are you doing?

11:15.442 --> 11:17.308
What, oh what? Oh,
just thinking thoughts.

11:19.378 --> 11:22.681
<i>Rainbow Dash was right. In</i>
<i>order to solve the mystery,</i>

11:22.683 --> 11:27.152
<i>we had to be focused, driven,</i>
<i>one hundred percent in the--</i>

11:27.154 --> 11:28.920
Ooh!

11:28.922 --> 11:31.423
The damask pattern on these
curtains is exquisite!

11:31.425 --> 11:35.260
Oh, and this velvet
rope holder, oh it's--

11:35.262 --> 11:37.328
We don't have time
to look at the decor!

11:37.330 --> 11:39.064
They're gonna kick me
out of the Wonderbolts

11:39.066 --> 11:40.799
unless we solve this thing!

11:40.801 --> 11:42.901
I know, Rainbow, and
I am on this case

11:42.903 --> 11:44.269
like a charm on a bracelet.

11:44.271 --> 11:46.037
Here's what I'm thinking:

11:46.039 --> 11:49.074
somepony had to bring
Spitfire that letter,

11:49.076 --> 11:52.210
which means somepony
must have seen them!

11:55.848 --> 11:58.016
I just have a few
questions for you

11:58.018 --> 12:00.752
and I'm sure once we get some
things cleared up, we'll--

12:00.754 --> 12:03.354
C'mon, Rarity; we
don't have all day!

12:03.356 --> 12:06.257
Where were you on the night
of last night at midnight?

12:06.259 --> 12:07.992
We were here, guarding
the hallway entrance

12:07.994 --> 12:09.260
like we were supposed to.

12:09.262 --> 12:11.196
A likely story.

12:11.198 --> 12:13.064
I'm telling you, we
were there all night

12:13.066 --> 12:15.300
and no one went in or
out of that hallway.

12:16.869 --> 12:17.936
Except for you.

12:17.938 --> 12:19.504
What are you trying to say?

12:19.506 --> 12:22.006
Just that there are only two
rooms in the northwest wing:

12:22.008 --> 12:24.142
yours and Spitfire's.

12:24.144 --> 12:28.046
So the only other pony who had
access to that wing was you.

12:30.182 --> 12:32.117
The waters were getting choppy.

12:32.119 --> 12:36.054
<i>Rainbow Dash's tactics</i>
<i>were... well, horrid.</i>

12:36.056 --> 12:38.223
<i>It was time for</i>
<i>another approach.</i>

12:38.225 --> 12:40.825
Perhaps I should
take it from here.

12:43.763 --> 12:47.165
You castle guards have
such a difficult job.

12:47.167 --> 12:51.069
I'm guessing that at times,
it can be rather boring.

12:52.505 --> 12:55.273
[softly] It is. I've counted all
345 bolts in the ceiling tiles

12:55.275 --> 12:57.475
293 times.

12:57.477 --> 13:01.312
And of course, being a castle
guard can be thankless work.

13:01.314 --> 13:04.449
I'm not saying you did,
but if you took a break,

13:04.451 --> 13:07.018
you more than deserved it.

13:07.020 --> 13:09.220
Aw, you're right, we don't
get a lot of recognition

13:09.222 --> 13:11.022
for what we do.

13:11.024 --> 13:13.191
Except for last night when
somepony was nice enough

13:13.193 --> 13:14.893
to leave a cake for us.

13:14.895 --> 13:18.096
So we did take one little
break when we ate that cake.

13:18.098 --> 13:19.397
What kind of cake was it?

13:19.399 --> 13:20.999
Cherry with a
custard filling.

13:21.001 --> 13:22.834
Chocolate.
Was the frosting
vanilla or chocolate?

13:22.836 --> 13:24.402
Was it decorated with
buttercream rosettes?

13:24.404 --> 13:25.503
It was!

13:25.505 --> 13:28.907
Ugh. Who cares how
it was decorated?

13:28.909 --> 13:31.209
<i>Rainbow Dash was</i>
<i>questioning my methods,</i>

13:31.211 --> 13:32.944
<i>but I knew what I was doing.</i>

13:32.946 --> 13:34.078
Do you?

13:34.080 --> 13:37.916
Oh. Did I say that
one out loud?

13:37.918 --> 13:40.985
I mean, even I think I'm
guilty at this point.

13:40.987 --> 13:43.288
I really did want
to fly in that show!

13:43.290 --> 13:45.590
What if I wrote that
note when I was asleep?

13:45.592 --> 13:48.526
Do you know what I do when I
sleep? Because I sure don't!

13:48.528 --> 13:52.497
Oh, calm down, Rainbow Dash.
We'll get to the bottom of this.

13:52.499 --> 13:54.432
There's only one
bakery in Canterlot

13:54.434 --> 13:56.901
that makes a chocolate cherry
cake with custard filling

13:56.903 --> 13:59.170
and buttercream frosting
rosettes, and that's...

13:59.172 --> 14:01.940
...Cinnamon Chai's
Tea and Cake Shop!

14:03.175 --> 14:05.944
[British accent]
Hello, how can I help you?

14:05.946 --> 14:08.179
I've heard you have the best
chocolate cherry custard cake

14:08.181 --> 14:10.381
with buttercream frosting
rosettes in town!

14:10.383 --> 14:12.984
Oh! You travel in
the right circles.

14:12.986 --> 14:15.420
We have the only chocolate
cherry custard cake

14:15.422 --> 14:17.488
with buttercream frosting
rosettes in town.

14:19.225 --> 14:21.893
Oh, no! But somepony's
already bought it.

14:21.895 --> 14:23.595
Who was the lucky pony?

14:24.930 --> 14:26.598
I can't even say!

14:26.600 --> 14:29.567
Why? Because it was
somepony famous?

14:29.569 --> 14:32.003
No! Because it
was hard to tell.

14:33.973 --> 14:36.908
She was wearing a trenchcoat,
sunglasses, and a scarf

14:36.910 --> 14:39.544
around her head that
covered most of her face.

14:39.546 --> 14:43.915
But I do remember she had a
really deep, raspy voice.

14:43.917 --> 14:46.117
Rainbow Dash: What do
you mean raspy?

14:46.119 --> 14:47.986
Well, kinda like yours.

14:50.022 --> 14:52.457
If there's anything else
you can remember, dish!

14:52.459 --> 14:55.493
Well, have I got
a story for you!

14:55.495 --> 14:57.896
The pony who bought the
cake threw a big fit

14:57.898 --> 15:01.132
when she accidentally got
chocolate ganache on her scarf.

15:01.134 --> 15:04.435
That's terrible! What
color was the scarf?

15:04.437 --> 15:08.573
White. No, maybe
more of an ivory.

15:08.575 --> 15:10.341
You don't say!

15:10.343 --> 15:13.544
I can't believe you're talking
fashion at a time like this.

15:13.546 --> 15:17.048
Rainbow, don't panic.
I need you to trust me.

15:17.050 --> 15:20.251
Trust you? You've spent
more time changing clothes

15:20.253 --> 15:23.621
than trying to help
me. I'm doomed!

15:23.623 --> 15:26.157
No, you're not. Come on!

15:28.694 --> 15:35.600
<i>â™ª [muted jazz trumpet] </i>

15:35.602 --> 15:40.171
Rainbow Dash was obviously upset
but I had all my ducks in a row,

15:40.173 --> 15:42.640
<i>except for one.</i>

15:42.642 --> 15:45.476
<i>She was not going to like it,</i>
<i>but there was only one way</i>

15:45.478 --> 15:48.279
<i>to find out if my</i>
<i>suspicions were correct.</i>

15:53.218 --> 15:54.452
We looked everywhere,

15:54.454 --> 15:56.454
but Spitfire wasn't
at her mom's house.

15:56.456 --> 15:57.455
Where could she be?

15:59.224 --> 16:00.525
[thunderclap]

16:00.527 --> 16:01.960
I've found the culprit!

16:04.496 --> 16:09.033
Somepony sent Spitfire away and
framed Rainbow Dash for it.

16:09.035 --> 16:14.472
And that pony was none
other than... WIND RIDER!

16:14.474 --> 16:16.107
[thunderclap]

16:16.109 --> 16:17.575
[gasps]

16:20.612 --> 16:23.314
Rarity, I can't believe you
would accuse Wind Rider

16:23.316 --> 16:25.049
of framing me.

16:25.051 --> 16:27.552
He's a living legend,
for pony's sake!

16:27.554 --> 16:30.621
All the evidence points to him.

16:30.623 --> 16:33.291
What evidence could
you possibly have?

16:33.293 --> 16:36.060
All you did was ask
about cake, admire decor,

16:36.062 --> 16:38.162
and change outfits
a gazillion times.

16:38.164 --> 16:39.564
Let me explain.

16:39.566 --> 16:42.367
I never believed you
would send Spitfire away.

16:42.369 --> 16:45.636
And when we found the rainbow
hairs in Spitfire's room,

16:45.638 --> 16:50.308
I could tell they didn't
fall out; they were cut!

16:50.310 --> 16:53.344
No pony loses hair in a chunk.

16:53.346 --> 16:56.080
And look at the ends;
it's a straight line!

16:56.082 --> 16:58.182
They were clearly
cut with shears!

16:58.184 --> 17:00.551
Which means somepony planted it.

17:00.553 --> 17:03.688
Then, when we were examining
Spitfire's room...

17:03.690 --> 17:07.692
...I smelled something on the
envelope. Juniper Phoenix!

17:07.694 --> 17:10.261
Wind Rider's cologne of choice.

17:10.263 --> 17:14.298
Then, in the castle hallway,
I noticed some of the damask

17:14.300 --> 17:17.035
curtains fell out of
their velvet rope holder,

17:17.037 --> 17:20.405
indicating that somepony had
been hiding behind them,

17:20.407 --> 17:23.341
perhaps after they dropped
off the fake letter.

17:23.343 --> 17:26.110
Juniper Phoenix is a
very popular fragrance

17:26.112 --> 17:28.413
and anypony could have
moved those curtains.

17:28.415 --> 17:31.716
Precisely why I questioned
the castle guards.

17:31.718 --> 17:34.252
They were at their post at
the entrance to the hallway

17:34.254 --> 17:37.221
all night except for
a small window of time

17:37.223 --> 17:40.491
when somepony brought them cake.

17:40.493 --> 17:44.662
A cake that was ordered by a
girl pony with a raspy voice.

17:44.664 --> 17:46.831
Whoever ordered the cake
got a chocolate stain

17:46.833 --> 17:50.735
on their ivory scarf, and
I couldn't help but notice

17:50.737 --> 17:53.838
Wind Rider's scarf is tied
in a tight Windsor knot

17:53.840 --> 17:56.441
instead of its usual
loose slipknot.

17:56.443 --> 18:01.279
And why is that? Is it to
hide... the chocolate stain?

18:01.281 --> 18:03.381
[gasps]

18:03.383 --> 18:05.450
This is preposterous.

18:05.452 --> 18:08.853
Wonderbolts, you don't
believe a word of this, right?

18:08.855 --> 18:11.689
Just admit it! You're as
guilty of framing Rainbow Dash

18:11.691 --> 18:14.692
as you are of ruining
that ivory scarf!

18:14.694 --> 18:18.196
Fine. You caught me! I did it.

18:18.198 --> 18:20.665
But why, Wind Rider?

18:20.667 --> 18:22.500
Is it because I took
the last broccoli

18:22.502 --> 18:25.503
at the dinner and you
really really wanted it?

18:25.505 --> 18:28.339
No. It was because he was afraid

18:28.341 --> 18:31.776
that you would break his long
distance Wonderbolt record.

18:31.778 --> 18:33.578
I heard him when Spitfire said

18:33.580 --> 18:35.546
you were close to
breaking his record.

18:35.548 --> 18:38.649
He said and I quote, "heh heh."

18:38.651 --> 18:40.718
That's the polite but
disingenuous laugh you make

18:40.720 --> 18:43.521
when you want to seem happy
but really you're not.

18:43.523 --> 18:45.356
I thought if I could
get Rainbow Dash

18:45.358 --> 18:47.458
kicked out of the
Wonderbolts forever,

18:47.460 --> 18:49.694
my record would be preserved.

18:49.696 --> 18:53.164
Really? That is so not cool.

18:53.166 --> 18:56.634
I thought you were the coolest
Wonderbolt ever until now.

18:56.636 --> 18:59.403
I did what I had to do
to protect my record.

18:59.405 --> 19:02.206
Sometimes, you gotta play
dirty to be the best.

19:02.208 --> 19:04.475
That's not what being a
Wonderbolt is all about.

19:04.477 --> 19:05.910
She's right!

19:05.912 --> 19:08.246
Wonderbolts look
out for each other.

19:08.248 --> 19:11.349
Which reminds me,
where is Spitfire?

19:11.351 --> 19:13.918
I sent her the letter
pretending to be Stormy Flare.

19:13.920 --> 19:16.521
I told her I had Pegasitus
and the only cure

19:16.523 --> 19:19.223
is the Ice Iris in
the Crystal Mountains.

19:19.225 --> 19:21.425
No wonder she's
been gone so long.

19:21.427 --> 19:24.729
Ice Irises are almost
impossible to find in spring!

19:24.731 --> 19:27.532
The Crystal Mountains are too
far for anypony to make it there

19:27.534 --> 19:29.934
and back before the
Royal Garden opening.

19:29.936 --> 19:33.838
Rainbow Dash, we need you
to fly in Spitfire's place.

19:33.840 --> 19:37.441
But Spitfire shouldn't have to
miss this. I'm gonna get her.

19:37.443 --> 19:39.210
Well, you'll never
make it in time!

19:39.212 --> 19:41.479
Then there's no time to lose!

19:41.481 --> 19:46.250
â™ª

19:46.252 --> 19:48.186
Rainbow Dash is still gone!

19:48.188 --> 19:49.420
Oh, don't panic.

19:49.422 --> 19:51.889
If I know Rainbow Dash,
she'll come through.

19:51.891 --> 19:53.524
[door opens and closes]

19:53.526 --> 19:56.928
[panting]

19:56.930 --> 20:00.431
Spitfire, you're back! I
can't believe you made it!

20:00.433 --> 20:04.202
Oh, I wouldn't have, if Rainbow
hadn't found me so fast.

20:04.204 --> 20:06.537
Gave me enough time to fly back!

20:06.539 --> 20:08.873
Rare, I couldn't have
done it without you.

20:08.875 --> 20:10.975
And I'm sorry
I doubted you.

20:10.977 --> 20:13.477
But why didn't you tell
me what you were doing?

20:13.479 --> 20:16.314
Well, I didn't want to get your
hopes up until I was sure.

20:16.316 --> 20:18.649
And I couldn't be sure until
I saw that chocolate stain.

20:18.651 --> 20:20.618
Thank you for believing in me...

20:20.620 --> 20:24.655
...even when I was doubting
you. I'm some friend, huh?

20:24.657 --> 20:26.524
Actually, you're
quite a good friend.

20:26.526 --> 20:27.858
You went to get Spitfire,

20:27.860 --> 20:30.328
even though it meant
you couldn't fly today.

20:30.330 --> 20:33.297
[sigh] I'll get
my chance one day.

20:33.299 --> 20:37.235
Or today. How'd you like Wind
Rider's spot in the show?

20:37.237 --> 20:41.305
What? You can't
do this to me.

20:41.307 --> 20:44.242
I'm one of the greatest
Wonderbolts there ever was!

20:44.244 --> 20:47.612
Not anymore. For attempting
to frame Rainbow Dash,

20:47.614 --> 20:50.581
I hereby strip you of
your Wonderbolt status!

20:53.385 --> 20:55.953
So would you like
to fly with us?

20:55.955 --> 21:00.391
Would I? Woo-hoo!
Yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah!

21:00.393 --> 21:02.927
Uh-huh, Uh-huh!
Yeah! Oh, YEAH!

21:02.929 --> 21:04.528
Uh, Rainbow Dash?

21:04.530 --> 21:06.530
[sheepish]

21:06.532 --> 21:07.431
Coming!

21:12.771 --> 21:15.506
<i>Rarity: So my friend got</i>
<i>her moment in the sun.</i>

21:15.508 --> 21:18.809
<i>Or the center of an aerial</i>
<i>flower as the case may be.</i>

21:18.811 --> 21:21.479
<i>And as for me? I got a</i>
<i>chance to show off my</i>

21:21.481 --> 21:23.547
Femme Mystique Chic collection!

21:23.549 --> 21:25.449
Stormy Flare:
That's nice, dear.

21:25.451 --> 21:27.585
Oh. Did I say
that out loud?
