00:08.533 --> 00:11.269
With night come wolves.

00:11.303 --> 00:12.772
"One...

00:12.805 --> 00:14.506
two...

00:14.539 --> 00:15.875
three...

00:15.908 --> 00:17.844
but where is the fourth sheep?"

00:17.877 --> 00:20.178
said the little boy shepherd

00:20.212 --> 00:22.815
as he watched over his flock.

00:43.368 --> 00:46.271
Leah.

00:53.245 --> 00:54.513
Daniel's Birthday Services.

00:54.546 --> 00:57.282
This is Leah.

00:57.315 --> 00:59.719
Gonna be late tonight.

00:59.752 --> 01:02.254
That's okay.

01:02.287 --> 01:05.223
I'm gonna end up
quitting this job.

01:05.257 --> 01:06.491
Sweetie, it's your birthday.

01:06.525 --> 01:08.527
If you want to quit
then you should quit.

01:08.560 --> 01:10.529
Why do you say dumb stuff
like that?

01:10.562 --> 01:14.599
Why do you say
dumb stuff like that?

01:14.634 --> 01:17.003
It just causes you
so much stress, so...

01:17.036 --> 01:18.470
So be understanding, all right?

01:18.503 --> 01:21.741
Don't talk me out
of dealing with it.

01:21.774 --> 01:23.910
Sorry.

01:23.943 --> 01:27.747
You know I just want to help.

01:27.780 --> 01:29.682
I'll call the restaurant
and see if I can change

01:29.716 --> 01:30.750
the reservation.

01:30.783 --> 01:31.718
I can do it.

01:31.751 --> 01:34.687
No. I got it.

01:34.721 --> 01:37.556
Look, I'll let you know
what they say.

01:37.589 --> 01:39.357
Okay.

01:39.391 --> 01:40.793
Love you.

01:42.594 --> 01:43.696
I love you too.

01:52.004 --> 01:57.009
Kill him.

02:40.753 --> 02:41.921
I'm home!

02:45.390 --> 02:46.726
Hello?

05:01.493 --> 05:02.795
Wanna come in with me?

05:09.268 --> 05:10.435
Dan?

05:34.994 --> 05:36.195
- Daniel?
- Ooh, fuck!

06:00.086 --> 06:01.619
Having some cake?

06:03.621 --> 06:04.556
Yup.

06:06.759 --> 06:11.030
Thank you for everything
you did tonight.

06:12.631 --> 06:13.733
You're welcome.

06:16.268 --> 06:18.237
I guess I've upset you.

06:22.174 --> 06:24.643
Do you want to talk?

06:24.677 --> 06:26.078
It's your birthday.

06:27.847 --> 06:30.816
Forget it, everything is fine.

06:30.850 --> 06:33.285
I don't want you to think
you did something wrong.

06:33.319 --> 06:35.087
Then what was it?

06:37.890 --> 06:39.225
Was it the makeup?

06:39.258 --> 06:43.062
Or the costume?

06:43.095 --> 06:46.832
Or am I just not busty
or something?

06:46.866 --> 06:48.067
I don't think
it's any of those things.

06:48.100 --> 06:49.869
Okay, then what is it?

06:49.902 --> 06:53.139
You'd rather... God, you'd rather
jerk off to a video

06:53.172 --> 06:56.275
than let your wife...

06:56.308 --> 06:59.078
- suck your cock.
- I know, it seems very bad.

06:59.111 --> 07:01.814
And I knew that
you probably jerked off

07:01.847 --> 07:03.282
to videos or something,

07:03.315 --> 07:07.887
but right after you're with me
and right after all that?

07:07.920 --> 07:11.057
Look, I don't know
how to say it.

07:11.090 --> 07:14.326
I... I guess it has to do
with being honest,

07:14.360 --> 07:19.331
and honestly, I don't know
how you're going to react.

07:19.365 --> 07:22.301
I dressed up like
fucking Wonder Woman...

07:22.334 --> 07:24.203
Believe me, I love you for it.

07:24.236 --> 07:28.074
But I mean, like,
there's just gotta be something

07:28.107 --> 07:29.607
that you fantasize about

07:29.642 --> 07:31.811
that you don't
ever mention to me or...

07:31.844 --> 07:34.046
I don't know.

07:34.080 --> 07:37.283
You see, this... this is
where I get annoyed.

07:37.316 --> 07:40.119
Because you act
like a clueless teenager.

07:40.152 --> 07:41.153
I don't know, Daniel.

07:41.187 --> 07:42.388
- I've always liked what we did.
- I think we need

07:42.421 --> 07:45.057
to experiment, okay?

07:45.091 --> 07:48.027
Now, I need you to be
open-minded with me.

07:48.060 --> 07:49.228
To what?

07:53.833 --> 07:55.301
Daniel, to what?

08:23.729 --> 08:26.699
Leah.

09:12.945 --> 09:15.748
Hey, baby.

09:15.781 --> 09:17.716
Hi.

09:21.420 --> 09:23.088
Are you ready?

09:24.456 --> 09:25.891
Yeah.

09:27.026 --> 09:28.761
Here he comes.

09:51.817 --> 09:53.018
Leah?

10:01.994 --> 10:03.262
Wake up.

10:34.226 --> 10:35.327
Good morning.

10:37.296 --> 10:38.297
Morning.

10:40.399 --> 10:42.768
Where'd you go last night?

10:44.937 --> 10:48.407
You didn't care enough to look?

10:50.042 --> 10:52.044
Well, I thought
I'd give you some space

10:52.077 --> 10:53.779
after last night.

10:56.615 --> 10:59.585
You're just willing
to let me go like that?

10:59.618 --> 11:02.488
Just disappear?

11:02.521 --> 11:05.224
I don't understand
how this is about you now.

11:07.860 --> 11:09.495
You know what, no, I'm sorry.

11:09.528 --> 11:11.530
You're right.

11:11.563 --> 11:13.365
I'll be fine.

11:13.399 --> 11:16.135
How about I make you something?

11:16.168 --> 11:20.072
How would you like one of
your wife's famous omelets, huh?

11:20.105 --> 11:24.076
I could make one with bacon
or with chives or...

11:24.109 --> 11:26.345
I'll all right, I already ate.

11:26.378 --> 11:29.081
Well then, how about
a classic stack of pancakes?

11:29.114 --> 11:31.550
I could make you
a full dozen or half dozen.

11:31.583 --> 11:33.218
I'm fine, Leah.

11:35.421 --> 11:38.424
How about a nice dinner then?

11:38.457 --> 11:41.226
We could celebrate
your birthday again.

11:41.260 --> 11:42.361
Or I could just stand here

11:42.394 --> 11:44.330
with a blank expression
on my face.

11:48.434 --> 11:50.436
Maybe that would fit
your picture

11:50.469 --> 11:53.005
of this needless sex doll wife.

11:57.910 --> 12:00.245
It's totally typical.

12:00.279 --> 12:02.181
I tried.

12:02.214 --> 12:03.515
I'm going out.

12:07.319 --> 12:09.988
Will you be gone long?

12:10.022 --> 12:11.490
Do you want me to do anything
while you're out?

12:11.523 --> 12:13.492
No.

12:13.525 --> 12:16.228
You're going to work?

12:16.261 --> 12:18.430
I haven't had a job
since I was a teenager, Leah.

12:18.464 --> 12:20.199
What?

12:43.155 --> 12:44.423
Daniel.

12:54.066 --> 12:55.334
Daniel, talk to me?

12:59.571 --> 13:02.141
Daniel, what did you mean
about your job?

13:02.174 --> 13:04.076
Is it so much to ask

13:04.109 --> 13:07.012
for you to leave me
the fuck alone?

13:07.045 --> 13:09.649
Or do I have to beg for sickness
to cover this planet

13:09.682 --> 13:13.152
and everyone
just keel the fuck over?

13:13.185 --> 13:14.520
Are you serious?

13:16.321 --> 13:20.125
There is nothing
that you can do for me, Leah.

13:22.094 --> 13:24.496
Your brain
just doesn't work like...

13:25.998 --> 13:27.433
Like what,
just explain it to me.

13:27.466 --> 13:29.568
What, you want to have
another fucking talk?

13:29.601 --> 13:32.604
So you can stare at me
with those dumb puppy dog eyes?

13:32.639 --> 13:34.573
And not understand
the most innate,

13:34.606 --> 13:37.309
fucking primal thing
about a man?

13:40.612 --> 13:43.750
And once again,
you have no fucking words.

13:43.783 --> 13:46.351
Fucking useless.

13:52.792 --> 13:54.661
I swear to God.

13:54.694 --> 13:57.296
Just the female brain.

13:57.329 --> 14:00.299
Your side of the species
doesn't know their place

14:00.332 --> 14:02.635
and doesn't know their purpose.

14:02.669 --> 14:05.672
You have no idea
the things I know.

14:05.705 --> 14:07.272
You can't even begin
to understand

14:07.306 --> 14:09.475
the things I know
about this universe.

14:11.477 --> 14:14.346
Oh, what, you're gonna leave?

14:14.379 --> 14:16.181
You're gonna show me
what's what

14:16.215 --> 14:18.116
and just how strong
a woman can be?

14:18.150 --> 14:20.586
Well, go!

14:20.619 --> 14:22.488
I bet you won't even make it
past the canyon

14:22.521 --> 14:26.191
before you realize just
how fucking much you need me.

15:43.201 --> 15:45.672
I'm sorry, Paris.

15:53.412 --> 15:55.682
I'm so sorry, Paris.

15:59.318 --> 16:01.320
Oh, I'm so sorry.

18:54.927 --> 18:56.696
Hi, honey bun.

19:00.532 --> 19:03.703
Have I ever seen
a pretty face so blue?

19:08.573 --> 19:11.043
Sweetie, are you on anything?

19:13.378 --> 19:17.717
Well then, if it's not something
you did to yourself,

19:17.750 --> 19:20.653
then it's something
someone else did to you.

19:20.686 --> 19:21.553
Kind of?

19:23.890 --> 19:26.324
Something along those lines?

19:28.527 --> 19:30.562
But that's not the only thing.

19:32.430 --> 19:33.699
Poor thing.

19:37.970 --> 19:39.705
You got a name?

19:42.642 --> 19:43.643
Leah.

19:44.844 --> 19:47.345
I'm Mary May.

19:47.379 --> 19:48.648
You can drink it.

19:48.681 --> 19:50.515
It's nice and warm.

20:11.003 --> 20:12.972
You gonna order anything to eat?

20:18.410 --> 20:20.847
No, I don't have any money.

20:20.880 --> 20:21.714
I see.

20:23.481 --> 20:24.817
What brought you out here?

20:28.087 --> 20:32.124
I was just driving
and ran out of gas.

20:35.527 --> 20:38.698
Trying to get away
from a man, sweetie?

20:38.731 --> 20:40.766
No reason to feel bad
about that one, sugar.

20:40.800 --> 20:43.002
Most of us have been there.

20:46.605 --> 20:48.174
Well, whatever he did,

20:48.207 --> 20:49.842
must have been bad enough
for you to have to drive

20:49.876 --> 20:51.744
all the way out here.

20:54.613 --> 20:57.449
Do you need help
getting back into town?

21:04.556 --> 21:05.925
I don't wanna go back.

21:07.793 --> 21:11.529
I'm guessing this guy
was some sort of a monster.

21:11.563 --> 21:13.900
Wonder what kind.

21:13.933 --> 21:18.871
We've got the manipulators,
the drunks, the fighters,

21:18.905 --> 21:20.940
the ones that use you for sex

21:20.973 --> 21:24.609
and the ones that abuse it
once you give it to them.

21:24.644 --> 21:26.078
Then we have the ones
who throw you away

21:26.112 --> 21:27.780
once they get it.

21:31.250 --> 21:33.119
Wanna know what I was up to?

21:37.189 --> 21:39.825
I live out here.

21:39.859 --> 21:41.093
In the woods.

21:43.162 --> 21:45.831
Kind of temporarily, I guess.

21:45.865 --> 21:47.565
My partner and I just came back

21:47.599 --> 21:50.102
to where we started
about three years ago.

21:50.136 --> 21:52.570
So now we're back
and moving forward,

21:52.604 --> 21:53.839
trying not to stay
in the same place

21:53.873 --> 21:55.741
longer than we have to.

21:57.043 --> 21:59.078
We kind of have
this little secret

21:59.111 --> 22:01.613
that we're keeping
from the world.

22:01.647 --> 22:04.616
That is, until we let
the world see it.

22:04.650 --> 22:06.018
Until then, we're just doing
what we want.

22:06.052 --> 22:08.586
Like this morning,
I wanted a real shower,

22:08.620 --> 22:11.023
so I came into town for a room.

22:11.057 --> 22:13.759
Then I wanted a real breakfast,
so I came here.

22:17.830 --> 22:20.633
You know, I can't
just leave you here, right?

22:25.805 --> 22:27.907
You live in the woods?

22:27.940 --> 22:30.176
Sometimes.

22:30.209 --> 22:32.610
Like in a tent?

22:32.645 --> 22:34.512
Kind of, sort of.

22:36.916 --> 22:39.584
What do you do?

22:39.617 --> 22:42.021
A little bit of anything
and everything.

22:44.622 --> 22:46.092
Do I need to invite you
to come with me

22:46.125 --> 22:48.995
or are you just gonna sit there
and look like you wanna come?

22:52.898 --> 22:56.568
Well, I've never camped before.

22:56.601 --> 22:59.271
I know, sugar.

22:59.305 --> 23:00.206
You do?

23:02.908 --> 23:05.144
You know those times

23:05.177 --> 23:07.545
when you feel like you know
everything about a person

23:07.579 --> 23:08.981
just as you meet them?

23:12.617 --> 23:13.652
Let's get out of here.

23:13.686 --> 23:16.655
I have someone
I want you to meet.

23:16.689 --> 23:18.556
Who?

23:18.590 --> 23:20.292
The Lord, our God.

23:21.660 --> 23:23.029
- What?
- Can I just say,

23:23.062 --> 23:25.563
he's someone
very, very different

23:25.597 --> 23:27.133
than whoever
you're running from?

23:27.166 --> 23:29.268
Totally safe!

23:29.301 --> 23:31.804
In fact, I guarantee you,

23:31.837 --> 23:35.041
you have never met
anyone like him before.

23:36.876 --> 23:39.745
He's helped me
through a lot of hard times.

23:39.779 --> 23:42.048
I think he can help you, too.

23:48.320 --> 23:50.956
I'll sit here all day
if I have to.

23:59.098 --> 24:00.232
How far is it?

24:23.422 --> 24:25.891
I've got someone
I want you to meet.

24:27.927 --> 24:30.830
She was alone at the diner
I went to for breakfast.

24:40.406 --> 24:42.341
Can you take me back?

24:50.249 --> 24:51.984
I want to go back.

25:08.000 --> 25:09.702
Excuse me, sir.

25:09.735 --> 25:12.271
Can I help you with something?

25:12.304 --> 25:14.840
I don't need any help,
thank you.

25:14.874 --> 25:16.909
Are you lost?

25:18.277 --> 25:20.212
I know the forest very well.

25:20.246 --> 25:22.081
Gee, I wondered.

25:22.114 --> 25:25.251
We'd seen you hiking
every day this month!

25:25.284 --> 25:27.686
What's bringing you out here?

25:27.720 --> 25:29.855
I'm searching for a plant.

25:29.889 --> 25:31.223
I see, you're a researcher.

25:31.257 --> 25:33.993
Well, what kind of plant
are you looking for?

25:40.966 --> 25:42.668
Maradiachi.

25:43.736 --> 25:46.438
Well, gosh, bud!

25:46.472 --> 25:50.342
This species of fern is thought
to have gone extinct...

25:51.410 --> 25:53.879
...quite some time ago.

25:53.913 --> 25:56.348
So it is written.

25:56.382 --> 25:58.751
What makes you think
you'll find this here?

25:59.952 --> 26:01.854
Tectonic shifts revealing seeds

26:01.887 --> 26:03.189
in subterranean air pockets

26:03.222 --> 26:04.890
preserved by
alluvial reformation

26:04.924 --> 26:05.858
and pressurization.

26:07.893 --> 26:11.931
There are also archived
personal accounts

26:11.964 --> 26:14.433
stating it's been found
here before.

26:14.466 --> 26:18.804
Well, who am I to hold up
a search like this?

26:20.372 --> 26:22.741
Civilizations
all over the world

26:22.775 --> 26:25.010
use this maradiachi strand

26:25.044 --> 26:27.346
for their distinct
healing abilities.

26:27.379 --> 26:28.480
It is claimed that after battle,

26:28.514 --> 26:31.283
the Aztecs and Mayans
used to rub it on their wounds

26:31.317 --> 26:34.920
to make them heal more rapidly.

26:34.954 --> 26:38.290
This sounds like
a crock of shit, I think.

26:38.324 --> 26:39.992
Hey, bud?

26:40.025 --> 26:42.828
Hey, I think we just got
a better chance

26:42.861 --> 26:46.398
of the zombie apocalypse
than finding this thing.

26:46.432 --> 26:48.200
I've found it.

26:50.102 --> 26:52.171
Oh, my God!

26:52.204 --> 26:53.038
Whoa!

26:56.508 --> 26:57.977
Oh, my...

27:00.045 --> 27:01.780
And it's preser... what are you...

27:01.814 --> 27:03.349
whoa, no, no, no, no, no,

27:03.382 --> 27:06.118
this is property of the park.

27:06.151 --> 27:10.389
We've gotta make sure
this is contained.

27:10.422 --> 27:13.025
- Maybe call it in.
- I understand.

27:13.058 --> 27:15.861
I don't know
what I was thinking.

27:15.894 --> 27:18.297
- I can't believe...
- Do you drink?

27:18.330 --> 27:19.798
Excuse me?

27:21.300 --> 27:24.403
Just a bit of
my home-brewed spirit.

27:24.436 --> 27:26.405
- To celebrate!
- Oh.

27:26.438 --> 27:28.374
I really shouldn't, I mean...

27:29.508 --> 27:31.110
Well, I...

27:33.178 --> 27:35.447
How often does a guy like me

27:35.481 --> 27:39.418
get to knock some nutso plant
out of extinction?

27:46.058 --> 27:47.459
What the fuck is that?

28:17.556 --> 28:18.590
Who are you?

28:20.592 --> 28:21.593
Who are you?

28:26.565 --> 28:28.500
How did I get here?

28:28.534 --> 28:30.536
What the fuck is my name?

28:30.569 --> 28:33.305
What the fuck
is my name?

28:33.339 --> 28:35.974
What the fuck is my name?

28:36.008 --> 28:37.042
Who am I?

28:38.678 --> 28:40.346
Who am I?

28:44.483 --> 28:46.018
Do you hear that?

28:48.087 --> 28:49.388
Do you hear that?

28:49.421 --> 28:50.657
Hey, do you hear that?

28:50.690 --> 28:52.057
Do you hear that?

28:52.091 --> 28:53.459
What is that?

28:53.492 --> 28:54.661
Hey, who are you?

28:54.694 --> 28:58.030
Hey, hey, hey,
hey, who are you?

28:58.063 --> 29:00.466
Where are you going?

29:00.499 --> 29:02.301
Hey, don't leave me.

29:02.334 --> 29:04.136
Where are you going?

29:04.169 --> 29:05.237
Do you hear that?

29:05.270 --> 29:06.338
Hey!

29:06.372 --> 29:08.140
Don't leave me.

29:08.173 --> 29:09.575
Please don't leave me!

29:11.243 --> 29:12.444
I want to go back.

29:14.246 --> 29:16.582
You seem really familiar to me.

29:23.455 --> 29:24.456
You've killed someone.

29:26.625 --> 29:28.527
No.

29:28.560 --> 29:30.195
You wanted to.

29:32.197 --> 29:33.666
It was a man.

29:37.469 --> 29:39.571
Someone who's caused you pain
for a very long time.

29:42.174 --> 29:44.376
It was a husband, wasn't it?

29:48.447 --> 29:51.250
And this pain
he pushed you into

29:51.283 --> 29:54.620
made you feel worthless.

29:58.424 --> 30:00.092
Is he a liar?

30:02.261 --> 30:05.531
He also pries on
your vulnerability, I take it.

30:08.600 --> 30:11.136
That sounds
quite familiar to me.

30:13.405 --> 30:16.208
You've been afraid
for a long time, haven't you?

30:18.444 --> 30:20.612
And now that you're here,
you're surprised?

30:23.348 --> 30:25.050
Realizing you feel...

30:27.219 --> 30:30.088
...somewhat secure?

30:31.390 --> 30:32.725
Don't you?

30:42.234 --> 30:45.971
If you let me, I can help you.

30:47.640 --> 30:52.110
With me, you will never
feel fear again.

30:53.445 --> 30:55.547
I have things that can help you.

31:08.761 --> 31:09.762
What's he doing?

31:12.431 --> 31:15.434
You ever heard the phrase,

31:15.467 --> 31:18.036
"liquid courage"?

31:18.070 --> 31:20.038
This blows that
out of the water.

31:35.587 --> 31:37.022
Don't be alarmed.

31:54.273 --> 31:56.475
If you trust me,

31:56.508 --> 31:59.344
we can make sure
you will never feel fear again.

32:01.280 --> 32:03.750
It's not gonna hurt me, will it?

32:03.783 --> 32:06.686
It's not like drugs or...

32:06.719 --> 32:09.121
I mean, what's it
really gonna do to me?

32:09.154 --> 32:10.622
Son of a bitch!

32:12.457 --> 32:14.393
Get on your knees!

32:14.426 --> 32:16.128
Get on your fucking knees!

32:16.161 --> 32:19.531
Okay, just... just breathe.

32:19.565 --> 32:21.466
All this time
I'd hoped I'd see you again.

32:21.500 --> 32:23.670
Somehow I knew
you would come back.

32:23.703 --> 32:26.739
Who are you?
What are you doing here?

32:26.773 --> 32:29.174
I think you have me mistaken
for somebody else, friend.

32:29.207 --> 32:30.609
Bullshit.

32:30.643 --> 32:32.611
I can't remember my name.

32:32.645 --> 32:35.715
I don't know how I got here.

32:35.748 --> 32:38.283
What the fuck did you do to me?

32:41.587 --> 32:43.488
Do you hear that?

32:44.456 --> 32:46.258
The whispers?

32:46.291 --> 32:48.628
No, the screaming.

32:48.661 --> 32:50.697
Of course you don't,
it's only me.

32:52.331 --> 32:54.566
No, it's just me!

32:54.600 --> 32:56.468
'Cause I'm trapped
in this fucking cursed place.

32:56.501 --> 32:58.738
Yes. Yes.

32:58.771 --> 33:00.505
Yes, I remember you.

33:00.539 --> 33:03.710
We met some time ago.

33:03.743 --> 33:04.911
We did?

33:04.944 --> 33:06.846
Randy.

33:06.879 --> 33:08.246
You said your name was Randy?

33:08.280 --> 33:10.215
You were patrolling the park.

33:10.248 --> 33:11.818
You had a terrible migraine,

33:11.851 --> 33:15.187
and it looks as though
you've still got it.

33:15.220 --> 33:16.856
I could help you with that
if you'd like.

33:16.889 --> 33:18.290
Please.

33:59.331 --> 34:01.199
You're gonna have to drink
this whole thing.

34:27.359 --> 34:28.695
What happens now?

34:32.799 --> 34:34.667
What happens now?

34:37.569 --> 34:38.771
Nothing.

34:48.380 --> 34:50.515
You should go, Randy.

35:09.501 --> 35:12.872
Leah, you don't have
to drink it.

35:12.905 --> 35:15.407
But if you don't,
you know what it will lead to.

35:16.709 --> 35:21.013
Trust this.

35:43.535 --> 35:46.404
Now it's time to relax.

35:46.438 --> 35:48.674
Just try not to think
about anything.

35:50.777 --> 35:52.945
Just let your mind go.

37:10.622 --> 37:13.525
Joanna? Douglas?

37:13.558 --> 37:14.559
Paris!

37:14.593 --> 37:16.629
Mom? Dad?

37:25.738 --> 37:28.174
Death.

37:28.207 --> 37:31.644
No need to search death.

37:31.677 --> 37:33.378
Death will find you.

37:35.114 --> 37:37.616
I know because I've seen it.

37:39.085 --> 37:42.154
I've seen blood engulf my home,

37:42.188 --> 37:46.859
and I've seen my family
rot under their skins.

37:48.961 --> 37:51.631
Fate has looked to me and said,

37:51.664 --> 37:56.135
"And now run,
for I will find you

37:56.168 --> 37:57.803
no matter where you are."

38:07.179 --> 38:08.915
Vincent?

38:18.024 --> 38:19.692
They're not here.

38:59.932 --> 39:01.767
It's really gonna help her.

39:06.138 --> 39:08.174
Hi, Miss Sleeper.

39:08.207 --> 39:10.575
- How are you feeling?
- How long was I asleep?

39:11.877 --> 39:13.079
Not too long.

39:13.112 --> 39:14.213
Thirsty?

39:25.224 --> 39:26.859
My fingertips are numb.

39:29.161 --> 39:31.063
And my toes.

39:36.002 --> 39:38.938
In fact, everything kind of
feels like it's floating.

39:43.075 --> 39:46.178
Leah, Davey and I would like
to offer you something.

39:46.212 --> 39:49.581
For a while now,
we've shaped ourselves

39:49.614 --> 39:50.916
for a mission.

39:51.984 --> 39:53.986
Okay.

39:54.020 --> 39:55.721
What does that mean?

39:55.755 --> 39:59.658
Things, one's ideas,
have become our blood.

39:59.692 --> 40:02.594
The way humans act now
is a phase,

40:02.628 --> 40:04.797
and soon there will be another.

40:06.098 --> 40:09.001
But we have
a way of ending that.

40:10.102 --> 40:12.071
A shortcut to a godsend.

40:12.104 --> 40:14.874
And you see, Leah,

40:14.907 --> 40:17.843
we feel something
very special in you.

40:17.877 --> 40:20.980
It was meant to be
that the three of us have met.

40:22.314 --> 40:24.817
What would you do
if you knew a way

40:24.850 --> 40:28.854
to stop all men from acting
the way that your husband does?

40:28.888 --> 40:31.123
It's a tall order.

40:31.157 --> 40:35.361
Davey has ways of extending
a human's normal lifespan.

40:35.394 --> 40:38.596
In time, we will be able
to hone our consciousness

40:38.631 --> 40:40.733
and with the whole world
watching 100,

40:40.766 --> 40:42.768
maybe a thousand years from now

40:42.802 --> 40:45.204
they'll see us transcend.

40:46.972 --> 40:48.606
I know.

40:48.641 --> 40:51.277
Just give it time.

40:53.379 --> 40:55.181
What are you thinking about?

40:56.782 --> 40:59.617
- My husband.
- You miss him?

40:59.652 --> 41:04.256
He was selfish
and manipulative.

41:04.290 --> 41:08.060
And I remember this one time,

41:08.094 --> 41:10.896
he admitted to the oddest thing.

41:10.930 --> 41:14.667
He started singing in his sleep.

41:14.700 --> 41:17.736
Just these ridiculous poetry...

41:17.770 --> 41:19.138
it sounded like gibberish,

41:19.171 --> 41:21.807
and when he woke up,
he started ranting about

41:21.841 --> 41:25.044
these outer terrestrial beings

41:25.077 --> 41:28.848
that would send him
strange energies

41:28.881 --> 41:31.083
from faraway planets
that he communicated with.

41:31.117 --> 41:35.354
Like places that would send him
energy and messages.

41:35.387 --> 41:37.356
Like signs that he could
interpret in his sleep,

41:37.389 --> 41:41.127
but then he acted like
none of it ever happened.

41:41.160 --> 41:43.295
And if I mentioned it,

41:43.329 --> 41:45.297
he...

41:45.331 --> 41:48.667
he got furious.

41:48.701 --> 41:50.002
But then, he...

41:50.035 --> 41:52.771
But then, he got scared.

41:52.805 --> 41:54.773
Did he ever mention a name

41:54.807 --> 41:58.043
that these beings
would refer to him as?

41:58.077 --> 41:59.778
Yeah, um,

41:59.812 --> 42:03.182
they called him Walter Wilbur.

42:10.055 --> 42:11.790
What?

42:14.026 --> 42:15.761
Leah.

42:15.794 --> 42:18.898
I need you to take me
to your husband.

42:18.931 --> 42:20.466
Tonight.

42:52.932 --> 42:54.833
Susanne,

42:54.867 --> 42:57.036
open your eyes.

43:01.974 --> 43:03.709
How is the pain now?

43:06.378 --> 43:08.047
It's gone.

43:11.383 --> 43:13.919
You fixed it, Walter.

43:13.953 --> 43:16.455
That's good, my dear.

43:16.488 --> 43:18.757
I'm glad for that.

43:18.791 --> 43:20.759
Now please,

43:20.793 --> 43:22.828
have a seat.

43:31.370 --> 43:34.473
We each have gifts.

43:34.506 --> 43:37.776
Every one of us,
whether we know it or not,

43:37.810 --> 43:39.511
are endowed.

43:39.545 --> 43:43.983
Mine, the gift of regeneration

43:44.016 --> 43:45.818
and protection.

43:45.851 --> 43:48.487
When you're with me,
you cannot be touched.

43:48.520 --> 43:51.323
No harm can come to you.

43:51.357 --> 43:53.959
This was a blessing
bestowed on me

43:53.993 --> 43:57.229
by someone
far more powerful than I.

44:04.570 --> 44:06.972
Now, you may be wondering,

44:07.006 --> 44:08.540
wondering about these.

44:11.210 --> 44:13.379
From a place in the sky

44:13.412 --> 44:15.514
far beyond the North Star

44:15.547 --> 44:18.350
were sent me these words,

44:18.384 --> 44:21.320
these symbols,

44:21.353 --> 44:24.490
expressions from far away.

44:26.959 --> 44:28.227
60 seconds.

44:30.129 --> 44:33.232
Hey, sorry, sorry.

44:33.265 --> 44:35.367
I have a few questions.

44:35.401 --> 44:38.103
So, you're...
you're telling me that

44:38.137 --> 44:41.307
those are messages
sent to you from...?

44:41.340 --> 44:45.244
Sent to me from a planet
called Xanian.

44:45.277 --> 44:47.246
Uh-huh.

44:47.279 --> 44:49.281
And how do you get them?

44:49.315 --> 44:53.218
It's called automatic writing,
psychography.

44:53.252 --> 44:54.620
They come to me in code,

44:54.654 --> 44:58.223
and I interpret
their true meaning.

44:58.257 --> 44:59.892
I just think this all sounds

44:59.925 --> 45:02.428
a little incredible.

45:02.461 --> 45:05.898
I don't think I...

45:05.931 --> 45:08.500
Look, how do I know
that she isn't just...

45:08.534 --> 45:11.003
acting?

45:11.036 --> 45:12.271
Walter, when we spoke
the other day,

45:12.304 --> 45:14.239
you told me that
I would be rewarded

45:14.273 --> 45:16.342
for coming here tonight.

45:16.375 --> 45:18.010
You will be.

45:18.043 --> 45:20.279
We have arranged an agreement
that will fulfill

45:20.312 --> 45:21.847
our monetary needs.

45:23.582 --> 45:25.050
- What?
- Taylor, with your

45:25.084 --> 45:28.187
incredible experience,
you can help us

45:28.220 --> 45:30.556
to account these gains,

45:30.589 --> 45:33.092
as well as earning
a generous income,

45:33.125 --> 45:35.260
and I believe

45:35.294 --> 45:38.364
it should be arriving...

45:38.397 --> 45:40.165
now.

45:44.203 --> 45:46.271
Hm.

45:46.305 --> 45:48.474
Who is coming through the door?

45:48.507 --> 45:50.442
The workers.

45:52.645 --> 45:55.381
They're a segment of our family.

45:55.414 --> 45:58.217
It's why we're here.

45:58.250 --> 46:01.520
Walter's made life good for us.

46:01.553 --> 46:04.456
He teaches us about the others,

46:04.490 --> 46:06.959
the ones who send him messages.

46:06.992 --> 46:08.627
Susanne believes
in this prospect,

46:08.661 --> 46:11.497
- don't you, dear?
- Yes.

46:11.530 --> 46:13.432
It's amazing, Taylor.

46:15.367 --> 46:18.003
I used to do things.

46:18.036 --> 46:20.239
I used to be around people
I didn't wanna be around

46:20.272 --> 46:23.142
because I had nothing else.

46:23.175 --> 46:25.310
Walter saved me from that.

46:25.344 --> 46:28.947
I'm just a little confused
as to what it is you want.

46:28.981 --> 46:31.250
Like, you want me

46:31.283 --> 46:33.419
to launder money for you?

46:36.656 --> 46:38.357
I don't believe that is the...

46:40.325 --> 46:41.994
Yes, there is the right time.

46:52.304 --> 46:53.673
Oh, wonderful.

46:55.240 --> 46:57.443
Honey.

46:59.211 --> 47:01.079
Where... where is everybody else?

47:06.385 --> 47:08.153
They're dead.

47:12.024 --> 47:15.662
We went outside, and the police,
they just started shooting,

47:15.695 --> 47:18.230
and Walter said that
we were gonna be okay,

47:18.263 --> 47:20.365
because we were
on a mission for the others.

47:20.399 --> 47:24.203
But, they just started...

47:24.236 --> 47:26.038
shooting at us.

47:26.071 --> 47:28.040
Luke died in my arms.

47:28.073 --> 47:30.409
Shh, shh, shh,
Mary May, Mary May.

47:30.442 --> 47:33.479
No, no, no, no, no.

47:33.512 --> 47:35.648
Mary May.

47:38.116 --> 47:40.452
What if I told you

47:40.486 --> 47:42.387
that they were
in a better place?

47:44.189 --> 47:47.092
Yeah, well Luke lives.

47:47.125 --> 47:50.429
Mary, he lives here.

47:50.462 --> 47:52.297
He lives here.

47:52.331 --> 47:54.767
You must believe me
that Luke left this place

47:54.801 --> 47:57.369
in happiness.

47:57.402 --> 47:58.771
I don't know.

47:58.805 --> 48:02.040
I feel so confused right now.

48:09.348 --> 48:12.050
I know that in time

48:12.084 --> 48:13.720
you'll know that I'm right.

48:17.256 --> 48:19.726
But, right now we have to
get you out of these clothes.

48:22.629 --> 48:26.131
Go ahead and get up there.

48:26.164 --> 48:28.267
Goddamnit!

48:33.605 --> 48:35.307
Go ahead, Mary May.

49:17.382 --> 49:19.284
Very good, Mary May.

49:24.556 --> 49:26.826
Take the rest off.

49:26.859 --> 49:28.527
Right now.

49:31.898 --> 49:33.498
Now.

49:37.937 --> 49:39.772
I'm calling the police.

49:51.516 --> 49:53.151
Did I do something wrong?

50:00.425 --> 50:03.328
Walter.

50:03.362 --> 50:06.231
The deceiver.

50:06.264 --> 50:08.266
Please, no, let me go.

50:11.436 --> 50:15.407
This whole time, Walter,

50:15.440 --> 50:17.442
you've had us convinced,

50:17.476 --> 50:19.646
but now everything you said

50:19.679 --> 50:22.815
has been proven
sheep talk by a...

50:22.849 --> 50:24.583
hail of gunfire.

50:24.616 --> 50:26.653
Davey, I believe
there's an explanation.

50:26.686 --> 50:28.855
Yeah, that's...

50:28.888 --> 50:31.891
exactly right.

50:31.924 --> 50:33.492
You have been lying to us.

50:35.360 --> 50:38.965
- Now, hold on just...
- Sh... sh... sh... shut up!

50:38.998 --> 50:41.801
Every time you open your mouth,
you vomit out a mess

50:41.834 --> 50:44.469
that I have to clean up.

50:49.608 --> 50:51.744
You know we have to
kill him, right?

50:58.316 --> 51:00.753
No, just... I don't think...

51:00.787 --> 51:02.387
No, no!

51:02.421 --> 51:03.856
- Come on.
- No!

51:27.647 --> 51:29.015
There you go.

52:01.546 --> 52:02.749
Oh.

52:05.584 --> 52:07.285
Oh, with everything you've done,

52:09.387 --> 52:10.957
My world

52:10.990 --> 52:13.525
requires pay.

52:13.558 --> 52:14.794
Retribution.

52:17.329 --> 52:19.966
Look at me.

52:19.999 --> 52:21.968
- Look at me!
- Ah, Davey,

52:22.001 --> 52:23.770
I think you broke my back!

52:23.803 --> 52:25.604
Oh, God!

52:25.638 --> 52:27.740
More manipulation.

52:27.774 --> 52:29.709
Maybe I might...

52:29.742 --> 52:31.576
should just kill ya.

52:31.610 --> 52:33.746
No, Davey.

52:33.780 --> 52:34.914
Davey, we can take the dive

52:34.947 --> 52:37.582
and go to Canada or the Midwest.

52:40.920 --> 52:43.388
We can give... continue
the call of weathers, come on.

52:43.421 --> 52:46.324
Mm, the call of weathers.

52:46.358 --> 52:47.794
Mm, nah, no, no, no.

52:47.827 --> 52:50.730
Well, the weather has died.

52:50.763 --> 52:53.933
I think, after today,

52:53.966 --> 52:58.104
it will be the call to future.

52:58.137 --> 53:01.974
Mary May and I
will be in charge now.

53:02.008 --> 53:05.077
You can be our gimp.

53:05.111 --> 53:08.648
What do you think,

53:08.681 --> 53:10.116
Mary May?

53:26.833 --> 53:29.501
Why do you keep
a significant portion?

53:31.637 --> 53:33.706
We will take only what we need
for our new mission.

53:35.641 --> 53:37.609
In exchange,

53:37.643 --> 53:39.779
Walter Wilbur

53:39.812 --> 53:41.513
is to perish.

53:43.850 --> 53:46.484
Change your name,

53:46.518 --> 53:49.421
and your face, too,
whatever you must.

53:49.454 --> 53:52.557
But, no more lies,
no more tricks,

53:52.591 --> 53:55.695
no more Walter.

53:59.799 --> 54:01.968
And if one day you do
travel back to your ways,

54:02.001 --> 54:05.403
the world will betray you.

54:05.437 --> 54:06.973
Maybe fate will
bring us together.

54:09.441 --> 54:12.044
And then, I will kill you.

54:12.078 --> 54:14.780
And I will do what I must
to change the world forever.

54:17.216 --> 54:18.985
Now, go.

54:39.171 --> 54:41.908
Okay, that's everything
I could find.

54:44.844 --> 54:47.213
What's this?

54:47.246 --> 54:50.650
Um, that's just...

54:50.683 --> 54:52.919
I don't know,
I thought you might want it.

55:08.000 --> 55:10.169
How much longer?

55:10.202 --> 55:12.204
Not long.

55:19.879 --> 55:22.580
How do you feel?

55:22.614 --> 55:23.849
Tired.

55:25.617 --> 55:27.753
My arm is numb.

55:30.089 --> 55:31.891
How do you feel?

55:34.860 --> 55:36.796
Strange.

55:42.868 --> 55:45.771
What will you do after today?

55:45.805 --> 55:47.640
Uh, I don't know.

55:50.109 --> 55:51.978
Maybe go north, or...

55:55.047 --> 55:56.614
Maybe south.

55:58.718 --> 56:00.686
The first thing I'll do
is burn this house down.

56:52.838 --> 56:54.673
Psst.

57:14.693 --> 57:18.064
This is meant to be.

57:19.965 --> 57:21.934
Hi.

57:21.967 --> 57:24.136
You must be Leah.

57:24.170 --> 57:26.038
You startled me.

57:26.072 --> 57:29.708
Funny, he didn't mention
how young you were.

57:29.742 --> 57:31.609
No matter.

57:31.644 --> 57:35.214
When I received his call,
I knew it was time to come out.

57:35.247 --> 57:39.085
Last time I saw Walter,
he was, um...

57:39.118 --> 57:42.321
we were...

57:42.354 --> 57:44.090
well,

57:44.123 --> 57:47.159
hard times travel slow.

57:47.193 --> 57:51.097
He was a bit terse
when I arrived, though.

57:51.130 --> 57:53.799
I figure that's because of
the state you left him in.

57:53.833 --> 57:55.901
I didn't leave him in any state.

57:55.935 --> 57:59.238
Running out on your man.

57:59.271 --> 58:02.208
They need us, you know, I mean,
what is a man without a woman

58:02.241 --> 58:04.643
- to take care of him?
- A child.

58:06.412 --> 58:10.015
You daft cunt.

58:10.049 --> 58:11.817
What was your name again?

58:11.851 --> 58:13.986
My name's not important.

58:14.019 --> 58:17.223
You can call me
Mrs. Wilbur, though.

58:17.256 --> 58:21.293
He was at such
a breaking point with you.

58:21.327 --> 58:23.429
I mean, after what happened,

58:23.462 --> 58:25.331
how you disappointed him.

58:28.100 --> 58:30.836
A woman is to take
what a man gives.

58:30.870 --> 58:35.341
She has to sacrifice for
every need and want he conveys.

58:35.374 --> 58:37.943
Walter's a very powerful man,

58:37.977 --> 58:40.679
and when a powerful man
needs something,

58:40.713 --> 58:42.148
it's best to keep him at bay.

58:44.150 --> 58:45.918
Why don't you
go on down to him now?

58:45.951 --> 58:47.753
He's in a good mood.

58:47.786 --> 58:49.855
Well, maybe not
too good a mood for you,

58:49.889 --> 58:51.323
but we'll see.

58:53.759 --> 58:55.327
Go on.

58:55.361 --> 58:57.329
There's lots
we need to talk about.

59:18.984 --> 59:23.722
You know, something's been
crossing my mind

59:23.756 --> 59:26.792
that she'll be pleased to hear.

59:26.825 --> 59:28.761
Susanne.

59:31.830 --> 59:33.866
I mean, she had a tainted brain.

59:37.870 --> 59:39.738
She would never be tamed.

59:44.877 --> 59:46.779
Not like you.

59:53.919 --> 59:55.154
The others...

59:57.790 --> 59:59.291
They meant it to be this way.

1:00:01.560 --> 1:00:04.496
And you and I
have been reunited.

1:00:04.530 --> 1:00:07.066
Yes.

1:00:07.099 --> 1:00:10.035
Everything happened
just as it was supposed to.

1:00:11.904 --> 1:00:14.173
So now,

1:00:14.206 --> 1:00:17.276
we could be here.

1:00:17.309 --> 1:00:19.845
You look good, Walter.

1:00:19.878 --> 1:00:22.514
Very healthy.

1:00:22.548 --> 1:00:25.985
It seems someone has been
taking very special care of you.

1:00:27.987 --> 1:00:30.389
Have you done the same for them?

1:00:30.422 --> 1:00:33.492
Walter,

1:00:33.525 --> 1:00:36.795
I think it's time
we get you out of these clothes.

1:00:45.904 --> 1:00:48.407
Told you I'd be back, Walter,

1:00:48.440 --> 1:00:52.077
if you returned to your ways.

1:00:52.111 --> 1:00:54.813
Walter,

1:00:54.847 --> 1:00:58.183
a hedonist,

1:00:58.217 --> 1:01:00.085
a misogynist.

1:01:03.255 --> 1:01:05.591
- Focus, Walter.
- My name's Daniel.

1:01:05.624 --> 1:01:08.394
Should come off of this.

1:01:08.427 --> 1:01:11.430
You are not your words.

1:01:11.463 --> 1:01:13.465
You're a predator.

1:01:13.499 --> 1:01:17.403
The wolf who stays
creeping in the shadows.

1:01:17.436 --> 1:01:20.606
You know, Davey,
perhaps we're the wolves.

1:01:20.640 --> 1:01:23.242
The ones that hunt the weak,

1:01:23.275 --> 1:01:26.312
they don't murder.

1:01:26.345 --> 1:01:28.981
Did you know that
about him, Leah?

1:01:31.950 --> 1:01:33.385
Do you recall who this is?

1:01:39.892 --> 1:01:42.528
- It's a woman I married.
- She's the woman you married,

1:01:42.561 --> 1:01:45.230
the human being
that you've been lying to.

1:01:45.264 --> 1:01:48.300
You feel nothing
from what you say or do,

1:01:48.334 --> 1:01:50.035
and no relation to a cause

1:01:50.069 --> 1:01:53.405
for a greater good.

1:01:53.439 --> 1:01:55.874
Only your own.

1:01:55.908 --> 1:01:58.010
Only for Walter,

1:01:58.043 --> 1:01:59.611
the deceiver.

1:02:01.613 --> 1:02:04.016
She is with us now.

1:02:04.049 --> 1:02:06.051
She shares our burden,

1:02:06.085 --> 1:02:08.087
our hearts,

1:02:08.120 --> 1:02:09.321
our vision.

1:02:11.390 --> 1:02:14.426
Say her name.

1:02:16.595 --> 1:02:19.431
- Leah.
- Leah...

1:02:19.465 --> 1:02:21.166
is the last person

1:02:21.200 --> 1:02:24.036
who will ever fall victim
to your powers.

1:02:24.069 --> 1:02:25.971
And soon, she will
have the strength

1:02:26.004 --> 1:02:27.439
that you suppressed her from.

1:02:29.541 --> 1:02:31.610
And then, more than
you could ever imagine.

1:02:34.246 --> 1:02:37.349
He's only so fitting.

1:02:40.052 --> 1:02:42.287
Leah.

1:02:45.491 --> 1:02:48.327
Davey... Leah.

1:02:48.360 --> 1:02:50.028
Baby.

1:02:51.698 --> 1:02:53.599
Leah, Leah.

1:02:53.633 --> 1:02:55.635
Baby, don't listen to them.

1:02:55.668 --> 1:02:58.170
Please, Leah, I love you.

1:03:00.339 --> 1:03:03.609
- Turn around and get help!
- That's enough, Daniel!

1:03:09.749 --> 1:03:12.251
No.

1:03:12.284 --> 1:03:13.653
Tell me the truth.

1:03:15.755 --> 1:03:17.456
What's your real name?

1:03:31.603 --> 1:03:34.606
You know my name, baby.

1:03:34.641 --> 1:03:36.709
That woman upstairs
is your wife?

1:03:44.751 --> 1:03:46.318
You come back now?

1:03:46.351 --> 1:03:48.053
For what, why?

1:03:48.086 --> 1:03:49.656
Oh, Susanne,

1:03:49.689 --> 1:03:52.191
it's like we said,

1:03:52.224 --> 1:03:56.028
wolves are the ones that
rid the weak from the world,

1:03:56.061 --> 1:03:58.397
and I'm sorry to see

1:03:58.430 --> 1:04:01.533
that you are still
under his spell.

1:04:05.772 --> 1:04:07.473
You stupid, stupid whore!

1:04:07.506 --> 1:04:09.174
my God,

1:04:09.208 --> 1:04:11.310
and all those
on the planet Xanian.

1:04:11.343 --> 1:04:13.646
Please let this planet burn!

1:04:13.680 --> 1:04:16.215
So, when this happens,
you... you can know

1:04:16.248 --> 1:04:18.183
that it was women
who caused the fall

1:04:18.217 --> 1:04:19.518
of the entire human race.

1:08:18.590 --> 1:08:20.727
I haven't let go now.

1:08:22.795 --> 1:08:24.864
I know.

1:08:27.365 --> 1:08:29.568
Will you sit back, please?

1:09:00.032 --> 1:09:02.367
Three years.

1:09:05.805 --> 1:09:07.707
You know, most men

1:09:07.740 --> 1:09:10.509
wouldn't have had a problem
just approaching me

1:09:10.542 --> 1:09:11.944
and asking.

1:09:14.446 --> 1:09:16.448
I remember

1:09:16.481 --> 1:09:18.651
watching you go...

1:09:18.684 --> 1:09:22.554
go from the backroom

1:09:22.587 --> 1:09:24.657
to the front desk

1:09:24.690 --> 1:09:26.391
to the backroom again.

1:09:29.829 --> 1:09:31.396
Looking over your shoulder.

1:09:33.766 --> 1:09:35.902
You never told me
what took you so long.

1:09:38.704 --> 1:09:41.573
You reminded me of a story
my mother used to tell me.

1:09:45.410 --> 1:09:46.846
A story.

1:09:50.149 --> 1:09:52.752
She used to tell it to me

1:09:52.785 --> 1:09:54.654
when I was a boy.

1:09:57.123 --> 1:10:00.525
I didn't talk to you

1:10:00.559 --> 1:10:03.129
for three years,

1:10:03.162 --> 1:10:06.565
'cause you reminded me
of a woman

1:10:06.598 --> 1:10:09.467
I used to picture in the story.

1:10:12.470 --> 1:10:14.006
It scared me.

1:10:16.843 --> 1:10:20.680
Tell me the story.

1:10:20.713 --> 1:10:22.748
I don't think we're gonna
have enough time.

1:10:26.819 --> 1:10:28.486
Wait.

1:10:44.502 --> 1:10:46.504
I'd really love
to hear the story.

1:11:12.031 --> 1:11:15.801
With night come wolves.

1:11:15.835 --> 1:11:19.005
"One, two,

1:11:19.038 --> 1:11:20.673
three."

1:11:22.775 --> 1:11:26.112
"But where is the fourth sheep?"

1:11:26.145 --> 1:11:28.080
said the little boy shepherd

1:11:28.114 --> 1:11:30.149
as he watched over his flock.

1:11:32.785 --> 1:11:35.054
The boy searched
at the top of the hill.

1:11:36.989 --> 1:11:38.724
He looked to the sky to see

1:11:38.758 --> 1:11:41.761
the sun would soon be setting,

1:11:41.794 --> 1:11:44.830
and it worried him.

1:11:44.864 --> 1:11:47.233
As when night came,

1:11:47.266 --> 1:11:49.702
wolves took over the land.

1:11:54.040 --> 1:11:57.143
The boy hurried
as to beat the moon.

1:11:57.176 --> 1:12:00.578
Though, as his pace quickened,

1:12:00.612 --> 1:12:03.182
so did the sun,

1:12:03.215 --> 1:12:05.483
and soon

1:12:05.517 --> 1:12:07.219
he was alone in the dark

1:12:07.253 --> 1:12:10.222
with howls aimed at the sky.

1:12:13.059 --> 1:12:15.962
The shepherd began to feel dread
had swallowed him

1:12:15.995 --> 1:12:19.865
as soft steps intruded
beyond his grasp.

1:12:21.901 --> 1:12:23.636
However,

1:12:23.669 --> 1:12:27.907
over the boy's head
came a veering light

1:12:27.940 --> 1:12:30.810
and the soft steps scattered
as if they were banished.

1:12:33.112 --> 1:12:35.648
A woman came
in the cloud of a lantern.

1:12:38.050 --> 1:12:42.655
Accompanied by his sheep,
she said,

1:12:42.688 --> 1:12:45.658
"Fear not darkness, boy,

1:12:45.691 --> 1:12:48.027
for it is yourself
who brought you to this place."

1:12:49.929 --> 1:12:53.966
The woman guided the boy
back to his pasture,

1:12:54.000 --> 1:12:57.003
where she asked him,

1:12:57.036 --> 1:13:00.006
"Why did you risk your life

1:13:00.039 --> 1:13:02.208
for a sheep?"

1:13:02.241 --> 1:13:03.776
To which the boy answered

1:13:03.809 --> 1:13:07.913
with only
the briefest hesitation,

1:13:07.947 --> 1:13:11.250
"To lose a sheep
would be to lose myself."

1:13:13.219 --> 1:13:15.654
And with that,

1:13:15.688 --> 1:13:19.025
the woman smiled delicately

1:13:19.058 --> 1:13:21.827
as she turned back
to the darkness.

1:13:44.717 --> 1:13:46.618
Paris.

1:13:50.189 --> 1:13:51.757
Paris, answer me.

1:14:06.372 --> 1:14:09.241
You know how
the story ends, Paris.

1:14:23.255 --> 1:14:26.759
Before the boy's very eyes,

1:14:26.792 --> 1:14:29.061
the woman flew
high into the sky.

1:14:31.931 --> 1:14:34.266
And her lantern

1:14:34.300 --> 1:14:37.403
turned into nothing.

1:14:37.436 --> 1:14:39.238
Now, stop.

1:15:03.996 --> 1:15:05.331
I love you, baby.
