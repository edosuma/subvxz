01:23.120 --> 01:25.315
Isn't this great?

01:26.080 --> 01:27.672
Look at the Duke.

01:27.880 --> 01:29.757
<i>One of his finest films:</i>

01:29.960 --> 01:32.633
<i>I Shoot Them
Because They're Injuns.</i>

01:34.600 --> 01:36.318
As a woman viewer...

01:36.520 --> 01:37.999
...what's your opinion, pumpkin?

01:38.800 --> 01:42.873
Daddy, I would rather be reading.
Does that tell you anything?

01:44.480 --> 01:46.391
It tells me you're a girl.

01:46.600 --> 01:49.672
Which means your opinion
means less to me than the dog's.

01:50.920 --> 01:52.433
Bud, what do you think?

01:52.640 --> 01:54.870
I'm thinking this Duke guy
walks a lot like you...

01:55.080 --> 01:57.355
...when you have to go
to the bathroom.

01:58.040 --> 01:59.268
I copied that walk.

01:59.480 --> 02:01.436
I figured the reason
he does it like that...

02:01.640 --> 02:04.598
...is because no one in these movies
ever goes to the bathroom.

02:04.800 --> 02:07.951
That's what the folks in show biz
called subtext.

02:08.160 --> 02:12.312
I wonder what kind of toilet paper
they used to use in the Old West.

02:12.760 --> 02:15.877
Thank you for getting him
started on this.

02:19.200 --> 02:21.555
Oh, my God. It's the Duke.

02:21.760 --> 02:25.275
Now he's gonna start wondering
when they went to the bathroom.

02:25.920 --> 02:28.070
And who invented the toilet bowl.

02:28.280 --> 02:30.874
It'd make a better movie
than that damn Columbus.

02:31.360 --> 02:33.032
After all, America was already here.

02:33.240 --> 02:35.708
It takes some thought
to think up a toilet bowl.

02:36.240 --> 02:37.958
Does this Duke guy
still make movies?

02:38.160 --> 02:39.878
No.

02:40.080 --> 02:41.877
Duke is dead.

02:43.640 --> 02:46.757
And what about that guy, Daddy?
Does he still make movies?

02:47.080 --> 02:50.516
Blackie Rabinowitz,
king of the bad guys.

02:50.800 --> 02:52.631
Alas, he's dead too.

02:52.840 --> 02:55.513
And what about the white guy
playing the Indian?

02:58.240 --> 03:00.071
He's dead.

03:00.280 --> 03:03.033
What about the white guy
playing the black guy?

03:04.880 --> 03:06.108
Dead.

03:06.320 --> 03:07.594
- And him?
- Dead.

03:07.800 --> 03:09.438
- And him?
- Dead.

03:09.640 --> 03:11.392
They're all dead.

03:11.920 --> 03:14.753
Everyone in every movie I like
is dead.

03:15.120 --> 03:18.237
Only me and Charlton Heston
are still alive.

03:21.160 --> 03:23.037
Wait, look, it's Fuzzy.

03:23.240 --> 03:27.028
See him, with his hat turned sideways?
That's how you know he's a sidekick.

03:29.360 --> 03:33.148
Look at this, Fuzzy's riding his mule,
Dadgummit, backwards.

03:34.080 --> 03:36.548
Fuzzy McGee,
the greatest of the sidekicks.

03:36.760 --> 03:40.355
Now, look.
He's gonna chaw, then spit.

03:43.080 --> 03:44.638
He's hitting that mule on the foot.

03:44.840 --> 03:48.116
Now watch, now watch.
He's gonna go, "Whoa. "

03:53.120 --> 03:55.475
Fuzzy McGee, he's still alive.

03:55.680 --> 03:57.238
Matter of fact, he's still working.

03:57.440 --> 03:59.476
He just made a commercial
just the other day.

03:59.680 --> 04:02.877
You know, that one
for adult diapers, Soak 'Ems.

04:04.360 --> 04:08.512
You remember. " For when you
just can't quite say 'whoa' anymore. "

04:10.200 --> 04:13.829
Oh, Fuzzy McGee. He'll outlive us all.

04:14.040 --> 04:17.350
<i>We interrupt Western Geezer Theatre
for a special announcement.</i>

04:17.839 --> 04:19.273
<i>Chicago's beloved Fuzzy McGee...</i>

04:19.480 --> 04:22.278
<i>...better known to our younger viewers
as Sheriff Soak 'Ems...</i>

04:22.480 --> 04:23.708
<i>...died today.</i>

04:23.920 --> 04:27.799
<i>Fuzzy is survived by his trusty mule,
Dadgummit.</i>

04:30.320 --> 04:31.958
I can't believe this.

04:32.160 --> 04:34.230
Everybody's dead.

04:36.000 --> 04:38.514
Makes you think about things, Peg.

04:38.720 --> 04:40.551
Life and death...

04:40.760 --> 04:43.718
...where we're headed,
what's it all mean?

04:44.320 --> 04:49.519
Why, when a woman's shoe size
is nine, her sock size is 10 to 13.

04:50.640 --> 04:53.234
It just doesn't make any sense.

04:53.480 --> 04:56.199
I think that's the one
that bothers me the most.

04:56.400 --> 04:57.628
Don't worry, honey.

04:57.840 --> 05:00.070
You know, men have
confusing sizes too.

05:00.280 --> 05:04.910
I mean, look how big
your thumbs are and yet...

05:10.640 --> 05:11.868
Fuzzy McGee.

05:12.080 --> 05:13.832
Fuzzy was married three times.

05:14.040 --> 05:17.430
He had 10 children,
and 22 grandchildren.

05:17.640 --> 05:20.757
Not to mention millions of fans
all around the world.

05:20.960 --> 05:23.872
Never was a man so beloved.

05:24.080 --> 05:25.877
Well, I guess we're all here.

05:35.800 --> 05:37.233
Anyhow, he died.

05:37.440 --> 05:39.431
So will you. So will I.

05:39.640 --> 05:41.870
I'm depressed, I'm going home.

05:45.480 --> 05:47.516
Well, boy, I guess...

05:47.720 --> 05:49.551
...you and me
are the only one who cares.

06:05.880 --> 06:08.155
Well, I guess it is up to I...

06:08.360 --> 06:11.158
...to speak at Fuzzy's last roundup.

06:12.840 --> 06:14.876
Fuzzy McGee.

06:15.360 --> 06:17.271
There was a man...

06:17.480 --> 06:20.040
...and a great sidekick.

06:20.720 --> 06:23.280
Where are today's sidekicks?

06:23.640 --> 06:25.596
Oh, the potential
of a young Rick Moranis...

06:25.800 --> 06:27.995
...or a Steve Guttenberg...

06:28.200 --> 06:30.111
...or Martin Short.

06:31.160 --> 06:34.516
Oh, the goofy, limping,
word-mispronouncing sidekicks...

06:34.720 --> 06:36.278
...they could be.

06:36.560 --> 06:38.835
But instead they wanna be stars.

06:39.040 --> 06:40.758
Good luck.

06:42.520 --> 06:46.069
<i>Short couldn't even hold his own
in Three Amigos.</i>

06:48.320 --> 06:49.992
But Fuzzy knew his place.

06:50.200 --> 06:52.191
He was a sidekick.

06:52.400 --> 06:55.915
He was a wuzzy-wuzzy sidekick,
wasn't he?

06:56.120 --> 06:58.190
He really was.

06:59.480 --> 07:02.233
Well, Fuzzman, this one's for you.

07:13.760 --> 07:15.239
Excuse me, sir.

07:15.440 --> 07:17.112
My grandfather died.

07:17.320 --> 07:19.470
He loved "O Sole Mio. "

07:19.680 --> 07:20.954
Two dollars, you sing to him?

07:26.200 --> 07:28.509
We're talking about cash, right?

07:43.280 --> 07:45.430
Peg, good news.

07:45.640 --> 07:48.712
They've raised minimum wage
for the bald?

07:51.320 --> 07:54.073
You don't deserve it, but I'll tell you.
I've been singing...

07:54.280 --> 07:56.157
...and my throat is parched.

08:08.800 --> 08:10.631
Does a body good.

08:11.240 --> 08:14.038
Wait a sec, got some milk
stuck in my teeth, Peg.

08:17.200 --> 08:18.553
Peg...

08:18.760 --> 08:20.716
...I need to talk to you.

08:20.920 --> 08:22.956
After watching that movie,
it made me think...

08:23.160 --> 08:25.958
...about where I wanna spend
my final resting place.

08:26.160 --> 08:29.152
So I went right out today
and I bought a plot. I couldn't wait.

08:29.360 --> 08:31.191
Because I've decided that I wanna...

08:31.400 --> 08:34.995
...spend eternity next to someone
that I really, really love.

08:35.200 --> 08:36.553
Oh, Al.

08:36.760 --> 08:39.991
So I decided to be buried
next to old Fuzzy.

08:42.480 --> 08:45.552
Oh, honey.

08:55.480 --> 08:57.436
And the mule.

09:00.280 --> 09:02.635
Oh, sweetheart.

09:03.160 --> 09:06.436
You know, honey,
they really don't need their own plot.

09:06.640 --> 09:08.312
Sweet of you to think
of them, though.

09:08.560 --> 09:11.279
Hell are you talking about?
I'm gonna be buried...

09:11.480 --> 09:14.916
...next to Fuzzy McGee
and Dadgummit the mule.

09:15.240 --> 09:17.674
Well, what about me?

09:17.880 --> 09:22.317
Come on, Al.
Let me be dead with you.

09:23.000 --> 09:26.072
You know, we never do anything
together anymore.

09:26.280 --> 09:28.236
If this is the way
you repay my love...

09:28.440 --> 09:31.955
...when you die,
I'm gonna bury you in a dress...

09:32.840 --> 09:36.230
...with white hose
that make your legs look thick.

09:37.720 --> 09:38.948
- Hi.
- Hi.

09:39.160 --> 09:41.549
We were just wondering,
do you know where Seven is?

09:41.760 --> 09:44.638
- No.
- Well, let me put your mind at rest.

09:44.840 --> 09:47.035
He's been living with us
for the last three days.

09:47.240 --> 09:50.198
- He walked in and wouldn't leave.
- He's improving slowly.

09:50.400 --> 09:53.119
He still can't read, write,
or use a knife and fork...

09:53.320 --> 09:58.155
...but he has learned how to chant " Kill
the Bundys" with the other neighbours.

09:58.880 --> 10:02.316
If you don't mind, we were thinking
of renaming him Henry, after my father.

10:02.520 --> 10:05.751
- Sure, that's all right with me.
- What do we care, do what you want.

10:05.960 --> 10:08.349
What we want is for you
to come and get him.

10:08.560 --> 10:09.834
He's irritating.

10:10.040 --> 10:13.953
He calls us Dad and Little Dad.

10:15.960 --> 10:17.712
Marcie, we don't have time
for this now.

10:17.920 --> 10:19.717
We are in the middle of an argument.

10:19.920 --> 10:21.911
Al doesn't wanna be buried
next to me.

10:22.120 --> 10:24.588
Isn't that the most ridiculous thing
you've ever heard?

10:24.800 --> 10:26.552
Well, frankly, yes.

10:26.760 --> 10:29.957
I think when two people
take the marriage vows, it's sacred.

10:30.160 --> 10:32.833
That's why I'm going to be buried
next to my husband Steve.

10:34.960 --> 10:37.110
My name is Jefferson.

10:37.360 --> 10:39.828
And I'm your husband now.
And, oh- And by the way...

10:40.040 --> 10:44.192
...we are not in bed, so there's
no excuse for calling me Steve.

10:46.800 --> 10:48.836
He is your ex-husband.

10:49.040 --> 10:50.678
Oh, don't take it personally.

10:50.880 --> 10:54.190
Every woman screams out "Steve"
during sex. Don't they, Peggy?

10:54.400 --> 10:57.631
Not me, it's too long a name.

11:01.920 --> 11:03.990
Oh, now, don't pout.

11:04.200 --> 11:06.873
You've got all this now,
you're already in heaven.

11:07.080 --> 11:09.196
Oh, God.

11:12.000 --> 11:13.831
Why worry about later.

11:14.040 --> 11:16.235
Oh, so I'm just the one sharing
a bed with you...

11:16.440 --> 11:18.556
...in these, your declining years.

11:18.760 --> 11:20.910
I want you to take care of me
when I'm dead.

11:21.120 --> 11:23.190
I want my hair done
by my own hairdresser...

11:23.400 --> 11:25.038
...not the guy down at the mortuary.

11:25.240 --> 11:27.913
You know,
the guy who does Al's hair.

11:28.560 --> 11:29.834
I'm warning you, Marcie.

11:30.040 --> 11:34.397
I'm not gonna soap up and dance
for you until this is provided for.

11:35.080 --> 11:37.275
You have to tonight,
my mother's coming.

11:37.880 --> 11:43.159
Marcie, I made that videotape for her
so she wouldn't have to come over.

11:44.080 --> 11:46.992
Oh, I'm telling you,
I think I feel a headache coming on.

11:47.240 --> 11:50.915
Oh, all right.
You know I can't say no to you.

11:51.880 --> 11:55.031
- Oh, Steve.
- Steve?

11:56.720 --> 11:59.280
All right, we are going home...

11:59.480 --> 12:05.476
...and I am gonna rock the Steve
out of you, baby.

12:08.560 --> 12:11.028
It always works.

12:16.800 --> 12:19.712
Why don't you ever rock me, Al?

12:20.400 --> 12:22.709
Because I'd rather stone you.

12:25.680 --> 12:28.558
Peg, I've been thinking,
I've got one pair of clean underwear...

12:28.760 --> 12:31.797
...from that three-pack you bought me
in the spring of '79.

12:33.480 --> 12:35.550
I'd like to be buried in that.

12:35.760 --> 12:37.079
Fine.

12:37.280 --> 12:42.070
Impress Fuzzy with the underwear that
I bought you for our 13th anniversary.

12:42.280 --> 12:45.397
You know, you male corpses
are all alike.

12:45.720 --> 12:47.153
Never a thought for the woman...

12:47.360 --> 12:50.511
...who spent her life
getting you into that grave.

12:51.880 --> 12:53.836
You have no idea
what it's like out there.

12:54.040 --> 12:55.951
A dead woman alone.

12:56.160 --> 12:57.912
No man is interested
in a dead woman.

12:58.120 --> 13:00.554
And if he is,
he wants a dead young woman.

13:00.760 --> 13:02.352
Boy, my life is over.

13:02.560 --> 13:06.314
I'm gonna be a dead woman
with children. Oh, my God.

13:06.840 --> 13:09.400
Who will want to marry
a dead woman with children?

13:09.800 --> 13:11.950
Maybe Mickey Rooney.

13:12.840 --> 13:16.310
Yeah, by the time I'm dead,
I'll be lucky if it's Andy Rooney.

13:17.080 --> 13:20.959
I'm not kidding, Al.
I wanna be buried with you.

13:23.720 --> 13:25.472
- I feel a whine coming on.
- Oh, God, no.

13:25.680 --> 13:28.672
- Yep, yep, I feel it coming.
- Hey, no.

13:28.880 --> 13:34.716
Al!

13:36.320 --> 13:40.438
Al!

13:40.640 --> 13:42.995
I don't wanna be alone.

13:43.200 --> 13:45.714
You don't love me.

13:45.920 --> 13:48.229
Oh, all right, Peg!

13:48.960 --> 13:53.158
You've already ruined my whole life,
you may as well ruin my death.

13:53.880 --> 13:56.155
Oh, Al.

13:56.840 --> 13:59.354
"Oh, Al," indeed.

14:06.600 --> 14:09.558
<i>- Here's a fine casket.
- Very nice.</i>

14:09.760 --> 14:12.718
And this one is top of the line.

14:12.920 --> 14:14.717
Solid bronze...

14:14.920 --> 14:18.117
...with a comfy velvet lining.

14:19.080 --> 14:21.071
Oh, my God, there's a dead man in it.

14:21.280 --> 14:23.919
Harry, he looks like
somebody dug him up.

14:25.880 --> 14:27.233
How long was I out?

14:31.880 --> 14:35.350
Gee, they must have smelled
you father's socks.

14:36.000 --> 14:38.195
Mom, if I may be so bold...

14:38.400 --> 14:40.755
...set aside the funds
you were gonna spend today...

14:40.960 --> 14:44.873
...and trust us to handle the details
when the dark day comes.

14:45.360 --> 14:48.033
I thought you said we were
gonna throw them on the grill...

14:48.240 --> 14:50.674
...and flush their ashes
down the toilet.

14:51.520 --> 14:53.192
Have you changed your mind?

14:53.400 --> 14:55.755
What, are you getting soft?

14:59.320 --> 15:02.278
You two scamps
certainly have a fine sense of humour.

15:02.480 --> 15:04.232
Well, it's- Yeah.

15:05.520 --> 15:08.114
Honey, we have to buy
and we have to buy today.

15:13.080 --> 15:14.593
So you like this one?

15:14.800 --> 15:17.075
- Yes, I do.
- Well, I don't.

15:17.280 --> 15:18.793
I'd like to see something else.

15:19.000 --> 15:20.592
We need a little more room up top.

15:20.800 --> 15:22.074
You know, for my hair.

15:22.280 --> 15:23.872
Oh, yes, well...

15:24.080 --> 15:27.834
...with a little customizing,
we can give you a bubble top.

15:28.040 --> 15:31.589
Designed to bring big hair
safely into eternity.

15:32.240 --> 15:35.312
Gee, Al, I have a bubble top.

15:35.520 --> 15:38.751
And you will as long as
they make strong bras.

15:40.200 --> 15:43.954
- You love the guys.
- I do.

15:45.200 --> 15:49.193
I must say, you two are planning
your funeral a bit early.

15:49.400 --> 15:52.790
You must have
some terminal disease.

15:55.600 --> 15:56.828
Yes...

15:57.040 --> 15:58.678
...marriage.

16:00.640 --> 16:03.837
Yes, we get quite a few of those.

16:04.040 --> 16:05.837
Most people feel that marriage...

16:06.040 --> 16:08.952
...eases the transition to death.

16:10.080 --> 16:12.753
If you'll excuse me,
I see some customers.

16:12.960 --> 16:15.633
- So we are gonna burn them?
- Yes, that's what I was trying-

16:15.840 --> 16:18.354
Say, you kids dying?

16:18.560 --> 16:21.154
No, virgins are just pale.

16:23.640 --> 16:26.757
Thus, the healthy hue on her face.

16:27.240 --> 16:29.356
So you're brother and sister.

16:29.560 --> 16:32.233
Well, it's never too early
to plan you funeral.

16:32.440 --> 16:35.318
With the world being what it is today,
let's face it...

16:35.520 --> 16:38.193
...you kids don't stand a chance.

16:38.400 --> 16:41.312
I can't say that I'm not pleased
about it, though.

16:42.160 --> 16:44.754
A lot of young people
are planning their funeral nowadays.

16:44.960 --> 16:46.916
It's the hep thing to do.

16:47.120 --> 16:48.712
<i>In the funeral business, we say:</i>

16:48.920 --> 16:50.717
" Can you dig it?"

16:52.160 --> 16:54.594
Sir, you are one cool ghoul.

16:54.800 --> 16:59.396
Yes, indeedy-oso.
Let's talk coffin, shall we?

16:59.760 --> 17:03.639
This one just screams you,
young fellow.

17:05.000 --> 17:08.356
<i>This is our
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle coffin.</i>

17:08.560 --> 17:11.790
I understand Michael Jackson
got one for Macaulay.

17:12.480 --> 17:14.391
It's a surprise.

17:15.000 --> 17:19.152
Oh, my brother doesn't need a coffin.
You can just put him into a Trix box.

17:20.480 --> 17:23.517
She only says that
because I do it like a bunny.

17:24.520 --> 17:28.229
Kids, don't you think that Daddy should
wear his wedding ring when he's dead?

17:28.440 --> 17:29.873
I married till death do us part.

17:30.080 --> 17:32.469
Which means when I'm dead,
I'm free to date.

17:36.200 --> 17:37.428
This is it?

17:37.920 --> 17:39.956
This is your final resting place?

17:40.160 --> 17:42.310
Well, there's no spot for me.

17:42.520 --> 17:45.080
That's why it's called
a resting place.

17:46.560 --> 17:48.869
Well, it sucks.

17:50.640 --> 17:52.631
I wanna be buried above ground.

17:52.840 --> 17:55.638
I don't like all those insects
bothering me.

17:55.840 --> 17:57.159
They always bite me.

17:57.360 --> 17:59.794
It's because I'm so sweet.

18:00.240 --> 18:04.392
Maybe it's because of the 200 bonbons
she puts away every week.

18:05.320 --> 18:06.799
I want another spot.

18:07.000 --> 18:10.197
Fine, Peg, get yourself another spot.
But I have my spot.

18:10.400 --> 18:12.436
I'm going to be buried
next to the Fuzzball.

18:12.640 --> 18:14.870
You'd better let me know
if you don't want it.

18:15.080 --> 18:18.356
Because Fuzzy McGee
was considered a genius in France.

18:18.560 --> 18:22.758
<i>I believe they called him
Le Grand Fuzz.</i>

18:22.960 --> 18:26.032
When news of his passing hits Paris,
this place will be swarming...

18:26.240 --> 18:28.231
...with a lot ruder people
than you two.

18:28.440 --> 18:30.635
I was smart to buy when I did.

18:30.880 --> 18:34.156
Would you tuck that big hair
back into your nose.

18:36.080 --> 18:40.119
Now do you see why
I ordered a bubble top for him too?

18:40.440 --> 18:41.668
You know, by the way...

18:41.880 --> 18:45.350
...I have heard that your nose hairs
continue to grow after death.

18:45.560 --> 18:47.755
So could you bury him face up?

18:47.960 --> 18:50.315
That way, the nose hairs can
sort of break through...

18:50.520 --> 18:53.353
...and it'll be like
we have our own tree.

18:54.560 --> 18:57.154
- And it'll be free.
- Yeah.

18:58.600 --> 19:00.909
Anyway, I wanna be buried
next to Al.

19:01.120 --> 19:02.473
<i>This is what we're gonna do:</i>

19:03.000 --> 19:05.070
We're just gonna move Fuzzy over.

19:05.280 --> 19:06.713
Who's got that one next to him?

19:06.920 --> 19:09.150
That's reserved
for his beloved mule.

19:09.880 --> 19:12.519
Well, certainly we can
move the mule.

19:12.720 --> 19:14.153
We'll just chop him up...

19:14.360 --> 19:16.715
...and bury him
in some crummy cans of dog food.

19:18.360 --> 19:20.555
That way, everybody's a winner.

19:22.200 --> 19:24.919
Then, we dig up the Fuzzster,
put him into the mule hole...

19:25.120 --> 19:26.951
...and I will go here.

19:27.160 --> 19:30.630
Then Al and I
can be together forever.

19:30.840 --> 19:33.718
Hasn't it already been forever?

19:34.520 --> 19:38.593
Honey, just pretend we're in bed,
and let me take care of everything.

19:40.360 --> 19:42.476
How much for everything?

19:42.680 --> 19:45.831
All right, let's see.

19:46.160 --> 19:50.039
That's bubble tops,
digging up dead man...

19:50.240 --> 19:52.708
...ignoring deceased's last wish...

19:52.920 --> 19:56.993
...grinding up mule into pulp.

19:57.280 --> 19:59.111
Tax plus tip.

19:59.320 --> 20:01.356
Let's say $27,000.

20:02.480 --> 20:06.439
Well, we might have to
cut out a few frills.

20:07.640 --> 20:10.598
How much is it if it's just
for the two plots and you toss us in.

20:11.040 --> 20:14.715
That depends. Are we
doing the digging, or are you?

20:16.080 --> 20:18.594
Well, I figured the wife would.

20:19.400 --> 20:21.630
Let's cut to the bottom
of the grave, sir.

20:21.840 --> 20:24.115
What do you have to spend?

20:24.680 --> 20:26.830
A hundred dollars.

20:28.120 --> 20:29.917
You looky-loos.

20:30.120 --> 20:33.317
It's people like you
who take the joy out of death.

20:34.240 --> 20:37.471
Oh, say, you folks look real sick.

20:37.680 --> 20:41.275
And your daughter looks like she'd be
mighty grateful to save a buck...

20:41.480 --> 20:43.311
...if you know what I mean.

20:44.920 --> 20:46.239
Peg, it's a shame.

20:46.440 --> 20:49.193
We don't have enough money
to bury you.

20:49.640 --> 20:50.959
But I'm gonna be dead alone.

20:51.160 --> 20:53.549
Oh, man, I can't wait.

20:55.040 --> 20:56.314
Well, what about me?

20:56.520 --> 20:59.398
Well, Peg, I don't care about you,
you work it out for yourself.

20:59.600 --> 21:01.955
Bury yourself wherever you want,
I'm not moving.

21:10.560 --> 21:14.348
Well, Fuzzy, just me and you now.

21:14.560 --> 21:17.393
Thank God, she'd have
driven you crazy.

21:17.960 --> 21:19.757
And, by the way,
in case you overheard...

21:19.960 --> 21:23.111
...I never would have let her move
Dadgummit, I love that damn mule.

21:23.320 --> 21:26.790
Hey, by the way,
we might be getting a tree.

21:28.440 --> 21:30.158
Oh, man, the time we're gonna have.

21:30.360 --> 21:32.874
I'll tell you about
all my high school football stories.

21:33.080 --> 21:36.470
You can tell me where they used to go
to the bathroom in the Old West.

21:36.680 --> 21:40.593
My guess is it's by the horse,
so you could blame him.

21:40.800 --> 21:42.995
Okay, Al.
We took care of everything.

21:43.200 --> 21:46.670
- And it's only gonna cost you $100.
- It doesn't involve moving me?

21:46.880 --> 21:48.950
Nope, you stay where you are,
next to Fuzzy.

21:49.160 --> 21:51.071
Fine, then I don't care.

21:55.680 --> 21:57.033
What are you doing, Peg?

21:57.240 --> 21:59.435
Well, I'm just showing you
where I'm gonna be.

21:59.640 --> 22:01.232
We're gonna share a grave.

22:01.440 --> 22:03.670
They're gonna stack us.

22:03.880 --> 22:05.154
Isn't that great?

22:05.360 --> 22:07.999
And whoever dies first
is on the bottom.

22:08.200 --> 22:10.031
Well, that'll be me!

22:10.240 --> 22:12.629
I know!
