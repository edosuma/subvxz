00:48.848 --> 00:50.873
Breakfast of champions, Dad?

00:51.484 --> 00:54.009
You were out late. Did you have fun?

00:54.687 --> 00:57.121
You know, I was out with the guys.

00:58.158 --> 01:00.422
I thought maybe we could
work out after school.

01:00.493 --> 01:02.757
-Do some weights.
-Yeah, whatever.

01:02.829 --> 01:06.162
Then we should be offering
organic entrees in all our locations.

01:07.500 --> 01:10.936
Look, we'll talk about this when I get in.
Yeah, I'll see you in 10.

01:11.004 --> 01:13.370
-Good morning, honey.
-Morning, wife.

01:13.440 --> 01:16.375
-You're out of here early.
-Meetings all day.

01:17.110 --> 01:18.873
Good morning, Lucas.

01:22.282 --> 01:25.251
-Will you be home for dinner?
-I'll call you.

01:25.618 --> 01:28.678
I gotta go.
I got my eye set on a new location.

01:29.122 --> 01:31.556
How many cafes can one person own?

01:32.025 --> 01:34.118
An even dozen should do it.

01:40.834 --> 01:43.064
Late night for you, too, Dad?

01:50.844 --> 01:53.472
And then I choked. I choked, I choked.

01:54.080 --> 01:56.412
Finally taking the court,
ladies and gentlemen...

01:56.483 --> 02:00.078
is the River Court's own Nathan Lee
star player and recent applicant...

02:00.153 --> 02:02.314
to the prestigious High Flyers
basketball camp.

02:02.388 --> 02:04.447
You forgot, late as usual.

02:04.958 --> 02:06.721
I had to stop by the post office.

02:06.793 --> 02:08.886
High Flyers, baby. What's the word?

02:08.961 --> 02:10.827
I don't know. I haven't opened it yet.

02:10.896 --> 02:13.730
-Dude, what is wrong with you?
-That's a felony.

02:13.800 --> 02:15.597
-Whatever. Turn us in.
-AII right.

02:15.668 --> 02:17.568
Come on, what's it say?

02:20.306 --> 02:23.207
-Says he's a finalist.
-Nathan, that's awesome.

02:23.276 --> 02:24.937
AII right, I'm just a finalist.

02:25.011 --> 02:27.502
It's not the same thing as me actually
getting into the camp.

02:27.580 --> 02:28.911
Act like you don't want it.

02:28.982 --> 02:30.882
What I don't want is to get my hopes up.

02:30.950 --> 02:34.010
No way they're gonna pick a guy that's
never played organized basketball.

02:34.087 --> 02:37.523
They'll pick a guy who played
like you did on my videotape.

02:37.590 --> 02:39.922
Nate, I'm your best friend, right?

02:39.993 --> 02:42.018
So I feel like I can tell you this.

02:42.095 --> 02:43.722
Stop being so damn modest...

02:43.796 --> 02:46.697
and come out here
so we can keep you humble.

02:46.799 --> 02:49.131
-Shoot for teams, huh?
-Exactly.

02:52.906 --> 02:54.430
Okay.

03:02.782 --> 03:04.977
So you want to hang
with the guys tonight?

03:05.051 --> 03:07.110
Oh, gee, there's a unique idea.

03:07.987 --> 03:10.421
Come on, Peyt, what?
I can't bond with the team?

03:10.490 --> 03:13.220
What about bonding with your girlfriend?

03:16.196 --> 03:18.562
-I was listening to that.
-Fine!

03:18.631 --> 03:20.599
You don't want to hang out with us?

03:20.667 --> 03:23.192
Why don't you sit in your room,
listen to your loser rock...

03:23.269 --> 03:26.170
and do live sex shows
on your webcam for all I care?

03:26.239 --> 03:27.831
Lucas, look out!

03:36.849 --> 03:39.044
Daddy teach you how to drive?

03:39.552 --> 03:41.543
Yeah, he sends his love.

03:42.622 --> 03:44.817
Now get out of my way, loser.

04:02.842 --> 04:04.833
Why do you have to treat him like that?

04:04.911 --> 04:06.776
It could have easily been you, you know...

04:06.846 --> 04:09.110
if your dad had married his mom
instead of yours.

04:09.182 --> 04:11.810
Yeah, like that was ever gonna happen.

05:04.504 --> 05:06.529
See, it's this retro style...

05:06.606 --> 05:08.938
and the leather interior package
makes this one...

05:09.008 --> 05:11.067
one powerful, sexy machine.

05:11.144 --> 05:13.669
And when you factor in
the Keith Scott service guarantee...

05:13.746 --> 05:16.112
and that elusive thing that we call...

05:16.182 --> 05:19.913
the cool factor, this car is definitely
gonna get you laid.

05:23.189 --> 05:25.521
Do me a favor. Have a seat in my office...

05:25.591 --> 05:28.219
and think about that leather interior.

05:30.096 --> 05:32.792
Let me guess, dog ate your work ethic?

05:32.865 --> 05:36.130
No, I had to go by the uniform place,
sign off on the new Ravens logo.

05:36.202 --> 05:38.830
Yeah, like Whitey's actually gonna
let you make a decision.

05:38.905 --> 05:41.601
-Look, it's early. Don't start.
-I'm the boss here.

05:41.674 --> 05:43.198
Maybe you should have married Deb.

05:43.276 --> 05:45.210
You might have gotten
her parents' money...

05:45.278 --> 05:46.506
and things would be different.

05:46.579 --> 05:48.479
Can we just leave the past in the past?

05:48.548 --> 05:51.381
Yeah, that's what you're best at, isn't it?

05:51.451 --> 05:54.352
See that lady out there
eyeing the convertible?

05:54.420 --> 05:56.183
She's ready to deal.

05:56.656 --> 05:59.523
-Try not to screw it up.
-I'm on it, Keith.

06:00.393 --> 06:02.918
I got to cut out early
for basketball practice, okay?

06:02.995 --> 06:06.260
Just about the time the bars open up,
right, boozy?

06:13.973 --> 06:16.806
How about I buy you a cold beer,
Miss Lee?

06:17.610 --> 06:20.875
Otis, you've been offering for ten years.
You know I don't drink.

06:20.947 --> 06:22.437
Doesn't hurt to try, does it?

06:24.951 --> 06:28.114
-Hey, sweetie.
-What's up, Mom? Got the mail.

06:28.187 --> 06:31.452
Some bills,
a letter from Uncle Cooper and this.

06:32.992 --> 06:35.153
Thinking about taking some classes?

06:35.228 --> 06:38.163
If they offer a course in making ends meet.

06:39.565 --> 06:42.659
You ever regret it,
your folks cutting you off?

06:44.303 --> 06:46.294
Not for one second, Nate.

06:47.173 --> 06:49.437
Otherwise I wouldn't have you.

06:51.010 --> 06:53.843
Besides, money buys you nothing
but misery.

06:53.913 --> 06:56.609
I mean, look at Dan and Karen and Lucas.

06:58.184 --> 07:02.052
You could up the traffic in here by hiring
some hot girls to dance on the bar.

07:02.121 --> 07:04.715
-There you go.
-I'm just saying.

07:04.924 --> 07:07.518
Speaking of hot girls, sorry I'm late.

07:07.727 --> 07:11.185
-The school bus driver ran out of gas.
-Where were you today?

07:11.264 --> 07:13.630
I told you, Mr. Hirschfield took us
to the planetarium.

07:13.699 --> 07:15.667
If you ever listened to me,
maybe you'd know that.

07:15.735 --> 07:17.327
Okay, all right.

07:17.403 --> 07:20.031
I just can't believe
you went out in public with that hat.

07:20.106 --> 07:22.836
Remind me why I'm friends
with you again?

07:22.975 --> 07:25.637
Nathan, this is from that basketball camp.

07:25.711 --> 07:27.508
Yeah, I'm a finalist.

07:27.980 --> 07:30.346
-It's no big deal.
-It's a huge deal, honey.

07:30.416 --> 07:33.510
-I'm really, really proud of you.
-Yeah, me, too.

07:33.586 --> 07:36.919
Congratulations.
Well, we'll have to celebrate later.

07:36.989 --> 07:39.583
Right now, dirty dishes are beckoning.

07:40.426 --> 07:43.156
You rock. Don't let it go to your head.

07:44.197 --> 07:46.665
You know you two are gonna
end up married someday.

07:46.732 --> 07:48.791
Stop it. We've known each other forever.

07:48.868 --> 07:51.701
-We're just friends.
-Good place to start.

07:52.271 --> 07:53.761
Keep dreaming.

07:55.274 --> 07:56.969
No, for real, man. I'm serious.

07:57.043 --> 07:59.603
-Dude's head really got bigger.
-Skills.

07:59.679 --> 08:01.078
I'm serious.

08:03.449 --> 08:04.882
AII right.

08:07.720 --> 08:09.585
You guys must be lost.

08:13.259 --> 08:15.227
Whitey closed up the gym.

08:16.996 --> 08:18.930
We got to have somewhere to run.

08:18.998 --> 08:20.795
You ain't about to do it up here.

08:20.867 --> 08:23.768
<i>-Au contraire.</i>
-Tim, just say, ''Yes, we are.''

08:24.370 --> 08:26.770
See, I'm in training for High Flyers.

08:26.839 --> 08:30.866
You wouldn't know anything
about that now, would you, street trash?

08:30.943 --> 08:33.467
-Want to bet?
-Nate's a finalist, too.

08:33.645 --> 08:35.443
-Guys....
-It's true.

08:41.687 --> 08:43.313
Pipe dream much?

08:43.856 --> 08:47.314
'Cause they only take one player
from each high school.

08:47.393 --> 08:49.827
How do you think they're gonna pick?

08:49.896 --> 08:53.093
Star shooting guard
for the undefeated Ravens...

08:54.333 --> 08:56.426
or the River Court bastard?

09:49.922 --> 09:52.413
So, I guess the rumors are true...

09:53.192 --> 09:54.716
Mr. Size 14.

09:55.795 --> 09:58.525
I think you're in the wrong locker room.

09:59.599 --> 10:02.295
The sign says, ''Boys,'' doesn't it?

10:02.768 --> 10:03.928
Okay.

10:06.973 --> 10:09.567
I'm Brooke.
But I bet you already knew that.

10:09.642 --> 10:11.667
Yeah, I got to go.

10:17.650 --> 10:19.311
Hey, Coach Scott.

10:30.296 --> 10:33.197
I got you. Come on. Push.

10:34.767 --> 10:38.032
-God, I had it, Dad.
-Right. What are you slinging?

10:38.237 --> 10:41.001
-About 160.
-Didn't know I had a daughter.

10:41.073 --> 10:43.439
Let's kick it up.
Gonna have to start two a days...

10:43.509 --> 10:45.568
if we're gonna impress
the High Flyers scout.

10:45.645 --> 10:47.442
Why? 'Cause you couldn't back in the day?

10:47.513 --> 10:48.878
I'm trying to help you.

10:48.948 --> 10:51.246
I don't want you to make
the same mistakes I did.

10:51.317 --> 10:53.877
What do you know about your other son
applying for High Flyers?

10:53.953 --> 10:57.389
Don't call him that.
Don't worry, he'll never make it.

10:59.425 --> 11:01.154
He made finalist...

11:01.927 --> 11:05.624
which means Whitey must have
signed off on his application.

11:10.302 --> 11:13.567
You're not seriously considering Deb's son
for a High Flyers spot?

11:13.639 --> 11:16.870
He's your son, too, Danny.
And good morning to you.

11:16.942 --> 11:19.672
That kid's just trying to sabotage
Lucas' shot.

11:19.745 --> 11:22.873
That kid sent in a tape that impressed
the scout so much...

11:22.948 --> 11:26.247
that he made him a finalist.
AII I did was sign the papers.

11:26.318 --> 11:28.786
I'm an equal opportunity instigator.

11:28.854 --> 11:31.220
-You did this just to get me.
-Danny...

11:31.290 --> 11:34.453
maybe it didn't make the nightly news
but this is not about you.

11:34.527 --> 11:37.360
Nathan's never played for a real team.
He's a street ball player.

11:37.430 --> 11:39.955
And apparently a pretty damn good one.

11:40.032 --> 11:42.523
At least he got something from you.

11:43.302 --> 11:45.793
-What are you up to?
-Just fairness.

11:46.005 --> 11:48.838
I wouldn't expect you to understand that.

11:48.974 --> 11:51.204
But if Lucas is the better player...

11:51.277 --> 11:53.643
he's got nothing to worry about.

11:53.846 --> 11:56.178
Till then, let the best man win.

11:58.617 --> 12:02.519
And be sure and let the door hit you
in the ass on the way out.

12:09.695 --> 12:11.185
She was totally naked?

12:11.263 --> 12:12.753
As the day she was born.

12:12.832 --> 12:15.699
-Only a lot more curvy.
-What happened then?

12:15.768 --> 12:19.204
-I got the hell out of there.
-You and Brooke Davis...

12:19.271 --> 12:21.364
captain of the cheer sluts.

12:21.574 --> 12:23.542
That is hard to picture.

12:23.743 --> 12:26.337
Yeah. I'd say hard is the right word.

12:28.180 --> 12:30.080
Okay. What's this?

12:32.451 --> 12:34.112
Score. A bracelet.

12:34.186 --> 12:36.916
Last time I got some fake tattoo
with a random number.

12:36.989 --> 12:40.425
Well, here. It matches that thing
you call a shirt.

12:40.960 --> 12:43.428
My mother made this for me, and shut up.

12:43.496 --> 12:45.521
-You shut up.
-You shut up.

12:47.233 --> 12:49.758
Don't say I never gave you anything.

13:07.186 --> 13:09.814
I think you have the wrong son's house.

13:09.889 --> 13:12.551
I need to talk to you about your game.

13:17.663 --> 13:21.565
I didn't know you were
that good a player till I saw that tape.

13:22.134 --> 13:26.264
You're a little rough around the edges,
but you've got the makings.

13:26.539 --> 13:30.066
If this is about me joining the team,
you can forget it.

13:31.644 --> 13:34.909
Son, I'm a lot smarter than
you give me credit for.

13:36.148 --> 13:38.742
Asking you to play alongside Lucas...

13:39.952 --> 13:44.013
with that ass crack of a father of yours
as my assistant coach...

13:44.323 --> 13:47.019
I wouldn't wish that on my worst enemy.

13:48.961 --> 13:50.326
Tell me...

13:50.663 --> 13:53.257
why did you apply to the High Flyers?

13:54.166 --> 13:56.066
'Cause I love the game.

13:57.002 --> 13:59.493
I guess all the messed up history
in this town...

13:59.572 --> 14:02.268
has kept me from being able to play it.

14:03.242 --> 14:05.802
This camp might give me a shot
at playing college...

14:05.878 --> 14:09.177
where I don't have to
live in anybody else's shadow.

14:12.484 --> 14:15.715
I know I'm good.
I just want to prove that I'm good enough.

14:15.788 --> 14:18.188
Nathan, I'm gonna level with you.

14:19.425 --> 14:22.258
You getting into that camp is a long shot.

14:23.028 --> 14:25.963
I can only pick one athlete
from this school.

14:27.199 --> 14:29.929
Normally, Lucas would be a shoo-in.

14:31.770 --> 14:34.261
But I was impressed with your tape.

14:34.540 --> 14:36.007
Then pick me.

14:36.909 --> 14:38.638
It's not that easy.

14:39.812 --> 14:43.407
I have to be sure you can hold
your own with a real team.

14:43.816 --> 14:46.580
Passing, defense, running picks.

14:47.620 --> 14:49.952
I can't play in that gym, coach.

14:50.489 --> 14:52.684
Then play at the River Court.

14:53.525 --> 14:55.959
You want me to play against Lucas?

14:56.629 --> 14:59.154
Technically, I want you to beat him.

14:59.698 --> 15:01.495
But that's up to you.

15:07.239 --> 15:09.707
<i>Ravens trail by one.</i>
<i>We're going down to the wire.</i>

15:09.775 --> 15:13.575
<i>Dan Scott with the ball, crosses half court,</i>
<i>less than five seconds now.</i>

15:13.646 --> 15:16.114
<i>Scott pulls up. This one's for the win.</i>

15:16.181 --> 15:19.207
<i>It's good! Dan Scott....</i>

15:19.451 --> 15:21.942
You want me to cue
Springsteen's <i>Glory Days?</i>

15:22.021 --> 15:24.751
-Complete the picture?
-So I'm nostalgic.

15:26.058 --> 15:29.186
That's one word for it. Sweet dreams, Dad.

15:29.862 --> 15:31.762
Cut me some slack, Son.

15:33.032 --> 15:36.160
I look at you,
and I see myself 20 years ago.

15:36.802 --> 15:39.430
And it reminds me of all that promise.

15:39.838 --> 15:41.465
If I ride you...

15:42.675 --> 15:46.941
it's because I want to see you feel
all the triumph that I never had.

15:47.479 --> 15:50.778
But I'm telling you,
this kid is a risk to all that.

15:51.717 --> 15:54.584
-You mean your other son?
-Only biologically.

15:54.653 --> 15:57.781
He means nothing to me.
And you mean everything.

15:59.291 --> 16:00.815
I saw his tape today.

16:00.893 --> 16:03.623
And I was wrong when I said
that he's no threat to you.

16:03.696 --> 16:07.154
So you're gonna have to do
whatever it takes to beat him.

16:07.232 --> 16:08.995
Don't sweat it, Dad.

16:10.169 --> 16:13.104
I'll protect what's left of your good name.

16:16.542 --> 16:18.840
You got bigger problems anyway.

16:22.381 --> 16:25.544
<i>Come visit us in ten years,</i>
<i>and I bet you can meet the kids...</i>

16:25.617 --> 16:29.212
<i>and get a tour of our big house</i>
<i>and see how happy we are.</i>

16:40.366 --> 16:41.731
What time is it?

16:41.800 --> 16:44.325
-What? That's not what I was thinking.
-God, I got to go.

16:44.403 --> 16:47.668
-Oh, no.
-I've already worked late a lot...

16:48.207 --> 16:50.004
these past few weeks.

16:54.380 --> 16:57.372
Dan is not gonna be suspicious, trust me.

17:00.519 --> 17:02.714
Why don't you stay the night?

17:03.789 --> 17:05.723
You know I can't do that.

17:05.790 --> 17:08.224
Well, you could if you leave him.

17:21.973 --> 17:23.635
Who would protect Lucas?

17:23.709 --> 17:26.337
From what?
Becoming a jack hole like his father?

17:26.412 --> 17:28.676
-I think it's a little late for that.
-Keith.

17:28.747 --> 17:30.339
Okay, I'm sorry.

17:33.786 --> 17:36.880
You know I would raise Lucas
like he was my own.

17:43.362 --> 17:45.330
Sometimes I think he is.

17:53.672 --> 17:55.503
Lucas, you're up late.

17:55.574 --> 17:58.042
-That makes two of us.
-Meetings, you know.

17:58.110 --> 18:00.578
-Yeah, I know.
-Hey, wait.

18:04.683 --> 18:08.312
I thought I'd make some cocoa.
We could sit and talk like we used to.

18:08.387 --> 18:10.719
You want a late night chat, Mom?

18:10.789 --> 18:12.950
Why don't you try calling Uncle Keith?

18:13.025 --> 18:15.152
I'm sure he'll come running.

18:20.966 --> 18:24.493
As you see, class,
galaxies come in three main....

18:24.570 --> 18:27.562
Of course, you're gonna do it.
You've got to play this game.

18:27.639 --> 18:29.504
Haley, it's Lucas.

18:29.575 --> 18:33.204
So? You can't let him stop you
from chasing after your dream.

18:33.278 --> 18:35.075
That's easy for you to say.

18:35.147 --> 18:39.447
Dude, nothing is ever gonna happen
for you if you don't put yourself out there.

18:39.685 --> 18:41.983
You got to shoot for the stars.

18:48.227 --> 18:50.821
What about you? What are your dreams?

18:51.230 --> 18:52.561
Chocolate.

18:52.698 --> 18:54.825
-Seriously?
-Yeah, chocolate.

18:58.103 --> 19:00.196
I never told anybody this...

19:00.272 --> 19:02.502
but I kind of want to be a singer.

19:02.574 --> 19:04.337
-A singer?
-Yeah, you know, like...

19:04.409 --> 19:07.344
tour the country and play concerts
and wear really cool clothes...

19:07.412 --> 19:09.243
and release an album.

19:10.048 --> 19:12.778
-You think that's funny?
-No, I just....

19:13.952 --> 19:16.580
-Haley, I've heard you sing.
-Shut up.

19:17.322 --> 19:20.849
Just because I'm tone deaf doesn't mean
I can't dream, okay?

19:20.926 --> 19:23.520
No, you're right. I guess it doesn't.

19:33.639 --> 19:34.936
I got it.

19:35.474 --> 19:37.339
Seduce the tutor girl.

19:37.409 --> 19:40.970
You know, like, get inside her head
and steal her away from him.

19:41.046 --> 19:43.446
Then dump her, crush her heart.

19:44.249 --> 19:46.717
Tim, that's the dumbest idea ever.

19:46.852 --> 19:49.218
What are you talking about? It's genius.

19:49.288 --> 19:51.256
You want to hear genius?

19:51.323 --> 19:52.881
Tonight's the game.

19:52.958 --> 19:55.188
And he can't win if he doesn't show up.

19:55.260 --> 19:57.125
You're gonna kill him?

20:01.633 --> 20:03.533
You got mad thinks, yo.

20:04.436 --> 20:06.870
Tim, just say, ''It's a good plan.''

20:29.528 --> 20:31.189
You're a tutor, right?

20:31.263 --> 20:33.788
You're jackass' girlfriend, right?

20:34.600 --> 20:36.591
I guess we're both right.

20:36.835 --> 20:40.669
Look, I'm Peyton and I know you're friends
with Lucas' brother.

20:40.739 --> 20:42.331
Half-brother. His name's Nathan.

20:42.407 --> 20:45.638
-He's, like, your boyfriend?
-He's, like, my friend.

20:45.711 --> 20:47.736
Why do you people always
assume that? God.

20:47.813 --> 20:49.838
Let me just save you some time,
faux-dilocks...

20:49.915 --> 20:51.382
he's really not into cheerleaders.

20:51.450 --> 20:54.146
Okay, first, retract the claws.

20:54.653 --> 20:55.881
Second...

20:55.954 --> 20:58.855
Lucas is planning on doing something
to Nathan tonight...

20:58.924 --> 21:00.516
before the game.

21:00.892 --> 21:03.918
-What's he gonna do?
-I don't have any specifics.

21:03.996 --> 21:07.659
But he will do anything
to get into that stupid basketball camp.

21:07.733 --> 21:10.065
So you might wanna warn Nathan.

21:10.836 --> 21:13.168
Just thought you'd like to know.

21:26.151 --> 21:28.881
I thought it was time to break the ice.

21:29.421 --> 21:30.945
After 17 years?

21:31.590 --> 21:32.852
Nice try.

21:34.626 --> 21:36.594
That's my DNA, you know?

21:37.029 --> 21:39.520
If that's what you need to believe.

21:39.831 --> 21:41.696
Let's get right to it.

21:41.900 --> 21:44.494
I'll give you $500 to withdraw
your application.

21:44.569 --> 21:47.367
Your wife give you this week's allowance?

21:52.644 --> 21:55.442
You really think you got a chance
to win this thing?

21:55.514 --> 21:56.981
You're kidding yourself...

21:57.049 --> 22:01.247
just like your mother was kidding herself
when she moved to Tree Hill.

22:01.920 --> 22:03.410
You know what?

22:03.588 --> 22:06.989
I wasn't even sure if I was gonna
go through with this game.

22:07.059 --> 22:09.050
But now I am gonna play.

22:09.761 --> 22:11.422
And I'm gonna win.

22:13.565 --> 22:15.931
I guess you are my son after all.

22:30.682 --> 22:33.048
Okay, it's $8 for the beers.

22:33.819 --> 22:36.754
-$20 tip.
-The 20 is on the River Court team.

22:37.723 --> 22:39.020
Good man.

22:42.661 --> 22:45.152
-Hey, honey.
-What's going on?

22:45.330 --> 22:48.424
We're starting the victory party
a little early.

22:51.136 --> 22:54.105
-What? Bad idea?
-No. It's just....

22:55.640 --> 22:59.007
Dan came to visit me.
He offered me cash to drop out.

22:59.578 --> 23:00.909
Oh, honey.

23:01.947 --> 23:04.507
Shut him out. You're good.

23:05.317 --> 23:09.083
I don't know if I tell you this enough,
but I am so proud of you.

23:09.688 --> 23:12.714
Even more so when you kick
that kid's butt tonight.

23:12.791 --> 23:14.952
Yeah. That's the plan.

23:22.000 --> 23:23.627
Good luck, Nathan.

23:23.702 --> 23:26.933
Thank God. Where have you been,
and why aren't you answering your phone?

23:27.005 --> 23:29.701
Right here. I'm recharging the batteries.
Why? What's going on?

23:29.775 --> 23:33.040
Because Lucas is gonna try something
tonight, okay?

23:33.278 --> 23:35.610
Let him. I'm not scared of him.

23:35.981 --> 23:37.915
Will you just be careful, please?

23:37.983 --> 23:40.713
I'm gonna be fine, all right? I promise.

23:51.263 --> 23:52.423
Nate!

23:53.932 --> 23:56.799
-What the.... Get off me!
-Come on.

24:00.372 --> 24:02.203
-Come on.
-Get off me.

24:02.974 --> 24:04.271
Let's go.

24:21.026 --> 24:22.459
Oh, come on.

24:33.638 --> 24:35.105
I warned you.

24:35.507 --> 24:38.135
But it seems you and me have
something in common.

24:38.210 --> 24:40.735
-We don't quit.
-''You and I,'' moron.

24:42.714 --> 24:43.806
What?

24:47.552 --> 24:50.817
Look, I have been working
towards this camp since junior high...

24:50.889 --> 24:53.357
and nobody's gonna screw it up for me...

24:53.425 --> 24:55.154
especially not you.

24:56.361 --> 25:00.798
So I'm gonna be nice and let you
walk away from this game.

25:02.200 --> 25:04.293
We should take his clothes.

25:06.037 --> 25:08.164
Tim, what is wrong with you?

25:08.807 --> 25:11.037
You pitch that every time we kidnap a guy.

25:11.109 --> 25:14.272
I mean, it'll make it harder
for him to get home.

25:15.380 --> 25:17.109
Yeah, so will this.

25:18.216 --> 25:19.706
Hold it, guys.

25:21.653 --> 25:23.450
Getting your jollies?

25:29.127 --> 25:32.062
You tell anybody about this,
and you're dead.

25:34.132 --> 25:35.429
Let's go.

25:56.221 --> 25:57.552
You ready?

25:57.722 --> 25:59.883
Nope. Not going.

26:00.725 --> 26:03.387
Come on, Peyt,
I thought we were gonna work on...

26:03.461 --> 26:05.361
getting back to normal.

26:06.765 --> 26:09.199
Okay, trust me when I say...

26:09.267 --> 26:11.735
that normal is the last thing
I want with us...

26:11.803 --> 26:15.261
because in case you haven't noticed,
normal sucks with us, Lucas.

26:15.340 --> 26:17.706
And I hate it when you call me Peyt.

26:17.776 --> 26:19.573
Is this about Nathan?

26:19.945 --> 26:22.607
No. It's about you.

26:23.848 --> 26:27.648
I'm starting to see who you really are
and I may be late to that party...

26:27.719 --> 26:29.812
but better late than never.

26:34.125 --> 26:36.855
You did something to Nathan, didn't you?

26:37.028 --> 26:39.462
What, your stupid kidnapping thing?

26:39.531 --> 26:42.364
I thought you said this wasn't about him.

26:46.171 --> 26:49.072
I'll just come back when you're
not so PMS.

26:49.741 --> 26:51.072
Don't bother.

26:51.142 --> 26:53.167
-Peyton--
-Luke, I mean it.

26:53.612 --> 26:54.977
We're done.

27:02.120 --> 27:04.680
Your loss, Peyt.

27:17.902 --> 27:19.597
Where's Nate, man?

27:20.038 --> 27:21.972
Maybe he chickened out.

27:22.207 --> 27:23.970
Maybe you're a dick.

27:24.643 --> 27:26.941
-What?
-Where's Nathan?

27:27.012 --> 27:29.606
That's what we're trying to find out.

27:29.748 --> 27:32.444
How'd you get that shiner
on your eye, dog?

27:32.517 --> 27:36.078
What, you and your boyfriend here
like it kind of rough?

27:41.960 --> 27:44.155
Break it up. Come on.

27:44.229 --> 27:45.662
What are you trying to do...

27:45.730 --> 27:48.198
get thrown out of the game
before it starts?

27:48.266 --> 27:49.790
Get over there.

27:54.005 --> 27:56.098
My son better be all right.

27:59.511 --> 28:01.342
Where are you, Nathan?

28:13.958 --> 28:16.256
-Get in.
-How'd you find me?

28:16.928 --> 28:20.091
You think you're the first guy
he's done this to?

28:20.565 --> 28:22.556
I can see why you stay with the guy.

28:22.634 --> 28:24.829
Actually, I broke up with him tonight.

28:24.903 --> 28:26.871
So you're helping me just to piss him off?

28:26.938 --> 28:29.873
That and you seem like a decent guy.

28:30.842 --> 28:32.901
Plus I think everybody deserves a shot.

28:32.977 --> 28:37.209
If you really want something bad enough,
no one has the right to stand in your way.

28:39.384 --> 28:41.477
-What?
-Nothing. I just....

28:42.420 --> 28:44.718
I got that weird deja vu thing.

28:45.990 --> 28:48.185
I don't believe in past lives.

28:48.259 --> 28:52.525
I think we've got one life, one chance,
and what we do with it is up to us.

28:52.597 --> 28:53.928
So get in.

28:54.032 --> 28:57.763
I'm your only hope of making it
to this stupid game on time.

29:13.451 --> 29:16.443
Ladies and gentlemen,
the game's looking like a forfeit...

29:16.521 --> 29:19.012
-with Nathan Lee a no-show.
-Not so fast, Mouth.

29:19.090 --> 29:20.455
What did you do?

29:20.525 --> 29:23.983
It's not my fault your boyfriend
finally grew a brain, sweetie.

29:24.062 --> 29:27.361
Peyton said that you were
gonna try something. I....

29:35.306 --> 29:37.797
-Are you all right?
-Yeah. I'm fine.

29:46.184 --> 29:48.118
-Am I too late?
-AImost.

29:48.353 --> 29:50.116
Let's get this game started.

29:50.188 --> 29:52.588
-Four on four. Let's hustle.
-No.

29:54.726 --> 29:56.318
Me against him.

29:56.828 --> 29:59.558
That's the way it's always been, right?

29:59.631 --> 30:02.099
Why should tonight be any different?

30:02.167 --> 30:05.136
-Your funeral.
-Game to 11 by ones.

30:06.070 --> 30:07.367
Let's go!

30:08.640 --> 30:11.609
-Shoot for ball.
-Fine by me.

31:10.802 --> 31:14.033
So, rank my last two girlfriends,
and you'll have the score, folks.

31:14.105 --> 31:16.164
It's ten-nine, Nathan Lee.

31:18.443 --> 31:20.775
And that's a foul by Scott.

31:21.546 --> 31:23.275
That's got to hurt.

31:35.927 --> 31:38.020
No foul. The basket counts.

31:39.464 --> 31:41.159
And Lee calls it good.

31:41.232 --> 31:44.133
It's ten-ten, game point. Next basket wins.

31:50.575 --> 31:53.169
You know, he's never mentioned you once.

31:53.244 --> 31:55.144
Not in all these years.

31:56.547 --> 31:58.310
And you really think...

31:58.383 --> 32:01.648
things would have been different
if he'd married my mom?

32:01.719 --> 32:03.687
If you do, you're a fool.

32:03.755 --> 32:05.313
You're the fool...

32:05.390 --> 32:08.325
and after you miss this basket,
a loser, too.

32:08.993 --> 32:11.359
Whatever. This is for my mom.

32:48.399 --> 32:51.698
Looks like Nathan's going to
High Flyers after all.

32:57.208 --> 32:59.073
It's just a game, Dan.

33:16.995 --> 33:18.326
Good game.

33:18.896 --> 33:21.194
You deserve to go to that camp.

33:21.866 --> 33:23.060
Thanks.

33:23.134 --> 33:25.364
You're gonna be okay. Just...

33:27.038 --> 33:28.869
come back to us soon.

33:31.676 --> 33:33.075
What's that?

33:33.644 --> 33:36.943
They haven't invented words
for how much I love you.

33:39.017 --> 33:42.077
Doesn't look like
I'll be needing this anymore.

33:47.558 --> 33:50.083
Don't say I never gave you anything.

34:05.243 --> 34:06.403
Haley?

34:24.594 --> 34:25.960
Hey, Nate.

34:28.433 --> 34:29.922
Nate, it's me.

34:30.301 --> 34:31.699
Don't worry.

34:32.136 --> 34:33.864
It's okay. It's me.

34:40.411 --> 34:42.606
Welcome back, little brother.

34:59.964 --> 35:01.556
How you feeling?

35:01.999 --> 35:03.967
Like I hit a brick wall.

35:06.270 --> 35:08.500
Doc says you're gonna be fine.

35:13.611 --> 35:15.476
What was this, anyway?

35:15.847 --> 35:19.806
Some sort of messed up
''anything Lucas can do, I can do better''?

35:20.351 --> 35:21.375
No.

35:22.186 --> 35:25.280
Want to hear something
really messed up, though?

35:26.557 --> 35:28.991
I thought I died, went to heaven.

35:29.927 --> 35:31.758
-No kidding?
-Yeah.

35:32.563 --> 35:35.259
Only, heaven was a place where...

35:36.234 --> 35:39.203
Dan chose your mom over mine.

35:41.038 --> 35:43.006
And Haley was tone deaf.

35:45.076 --> 35:47.340
Turns out it was only a dream.

35:48.312 --> 35:50.542
I did kick your ass in one-on-one, though.

35:50.615 --> 35:53.083
I guess it was a dream, then, huh?

35:58.589 --> 36:01.285
I know you asked me not to...

36:02.627 --> 36:04.356
but I called Haley.

36:06.230 --> 36:09.393
She's your wife, Nate, and she loves you.

36:10.535 --> 36:12.264
She needed to know.

36:19.410 --> 36:21.844
Nate, I have to ask you something.

36:25.149 --> 36:27.140
When you hit the wall...

36:29.320 --> 36:31.948
there was no brake marks on the track.

36:34.292 --> 36:37.125
You're asking me if I did this on purpose?

36:41.365 --> 36:42.593
Nathan?

36:42.900 --> 36:44.231
Thank God.

36:46.337 --> 36:48.134
I'll let you two....

36:50.908 --> 36:53.103
-Nathan, I--
-I love you, Mom.

36:56.747 --> 36:58.112
I mean that.

36:58.182 --> 37:01.276
And I know I've been a jerk lately to you...

37:02.820 --> 37:04.481
to everybody else.

37:07.692 --> 37:09.023
I'm sorry.

37:09.460 --> 37:12.224
-You've been hurting.
-It doesn't matter.

37:12.763 --> 37:15.755
I know you're just trying
to be a good mother.

37:27.578 --> 37:30.547
I haven't been a good mother, Nathan.

37:32.116 --> 37:34.414
But that's going to change now.

37:35.219 --> 37:37.346
What are you talking about?

37:38.756 --> 37:41.088
I need to be stronger for you...

37:41.659 --> 37:43.183
and for myself.

37:44.662 --> 37:47.222
So while you're healing from this...

37:47.698 --> 37:49.495
I'll be healing, too.

37:51.269 --> 37:52.736
I promise you.

37:55.506 --> 37:57.133
Whatever it is...

37:57.875 --> 37:59.638
I got your back.

38:02.546 --> 38:05.481
Do you ever wonder what life
would be like...

38:06.350 --> 38:08.250
if Dan had married Karen...

38:08.953 --> 38:11.148
just stayed out of our lives?

38:12.823 --> 38:14.290
AII the time.

38:15.092 --> 38:16.150
Why?

38:27.204 --> 38:29.434
Glad to see you're awake, Son.

38:59.070 --> 39:00.833
A receipt for a car.

39:19.690 --> 39:22.488
Were you able to get in touch with Keith?

39:22.927 --> 39:24.827
His voice mail is full.

39:25.663 --> 39:28.632
He needs to know
what's happened with Nathan.

39:28.799 --> 39:29.925
Yeah.

39:30.534 --> 39:33.162
But I can't even leave him a message.

39:34.238 --> 39:36.001
Where is he, Whitey?

39:36.874 --> 39:38.364
I wish I knew.

39:52.390 --> 39:53.948
It's okay, Deb.

39:54.358 --> 39:56.588
I'll be here when you get out.

40:14.979 --> 40:17.777
Sorry, guys. Visiting hours are over.

40:21.152 --> 40:23.916
-You need anything?
-No, I'm cool, man.

40:33.931 --> 40:35.922
I know you both want me.

40:36.967 --> 40:39.128
Yeah. In your dreams.

40:39.970 --> 40:41.096
Bye.

41:19.443 --> 41:20.637
Hello?

41:21.078 --> 41:22.705
<i>It's me. Nathan.</i>

41:23.113 --> 41:24.580
Thank God.

41:25.416 --> 41:26.747
What happened?

41:27.218 --> 41:29.584
-I'm gonna be okay.
<i>-I'm glad.</i>

41:30.321 --> 41:32.551
I'm coming home tomorrow, okay?

41:32.623 --> 41:34.181
Actually, no.

41:35.326 --> 41:36.816
It's not okay.

41:38.762 --> 41:40.127
Don't come home, Haley.

41:40.664 --> 41:43.929
-Nathan, I have to come home.
<i>-No, you don't.</i>

41:44.869 --> 41:46.860
You have to go after your dream...

41:46.937 --> 41:49.371
just like I have to go after mine.

41:50.808 --> 41:52.935
'Cause if we don't, then...

41:53.677 --> 41:56.305
we're just gonna end up regretting it.

41:56.747 --> 41:58.806
And we're gonna end up
resenting each other.

41:59.583 --> 42:02.609
-Nathan, I wouldn't--
<i>-No, we don't know that.</i>

42:03.020 --> 42:05.420
Nobody knows what's gonna happen.

42:07.258 --> 42:09.658
<i>Whatever choice you make today...</i>

42:10.995 --> 42:13.657
<i>is gonna affect the rest of your life.</i>

42:14.732 --> 42:15.858
So...

42:17.268 --> 42:18.633
don't come home, Haley.

42:20.204 --> 42:22.001
Nathan, listen....

42:22.973 --> 42:24.702
'Cause I don't want you to.

43:30.407 --> 43:31.396
