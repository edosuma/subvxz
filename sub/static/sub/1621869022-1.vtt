WEBVTT

00:06.715 --> 00:09.718
with me

00:12.638 --> 00:15.724
with me

00:18.560 --> 00:21.563
with me

00:22.397 --> 00:27.069
a trip into the sky with me

00:28.987 --> 00:31.949
driving on the west side

00:40.707 --> 00:43.585
say ah

00:56.682 --> 00:57.683
- Hey, babe.

00:58.809 --> 01:02.062
Why don't you let me pick the
next song?

01:02.062 --> 01:03.522
- I'm riding shotgun.

01:03.522 --> 01:05.148
I play DJ.

01:05.148 --> 01:06.483
You wanted to pick the songs,

01:06.483 --> 01:08.193
you should have let me drive.

01:08.193 --> 01:10.028
- Yeah, well, you don't
know where we're going.

01:10.028 --> 01:12.656
- Well, without that
GPS neither would you.

01:14.366 --> 01:15.200
- You're gonna love it.

01:17.995 --> 01:20.789
me

01:23.709 --> 01:25.168
with me

01:25.168 --> 01:26.670
- Have much longer do have?

01:28.046 --> 01:29.339
I just got an idea.

01:31.049 --> 01:32.843
- What sort of idea?

01:32.843 --> 01:34.469
- Hm.

01:34.469 --> 01:36.305
This sort of idea?

01:38.598 --> 01:39.891
- Yeah.

01:39.891 --> 01:41.643
Yeah, that's good idea.

01:41.643 --> 01:42.894
- But do we have time?

01:42.894 --> 01:43.812
- We'll make time?

01:53.238 --> 01:54.823
- Are your eyes closed?

01:54.823 --> 01:56.033
- What? No.

01:56.033 --> 01:57.242
- Are you lying to me?

01:57.242 --> 01:59.286
- Look, they're wide open, okay.

01:59.286 --> 02:00.704
Please, don't stop, come on.

02:04.958 --> 02:05.792
Oh my God.

02:07.753 --> 02:10.922
Oh, your mouth is like a
leaf blower in reverse.

02:12.716 --> 02:14.468
- A leaf blower in reverse?

02:15.886 --> 02:16.845
- Yeah.

02:16.845 --> 02:20.140
It's like, sucks in
instead of blowing out.

02:22.309 --> 02:23.477
- Wow.

02:23.477 --> 02:24.936
- Look, I couldn't think
straight.

02:24.936 --> 02:26.271
Okay, you know what I meant.

02:26.271 --> 02:28.732
- I do and I'm not particularly
fond

02:28.732 --> 02:30.317
of being compared to lawn
equipment.

02:30.317 --> 02:32.319
- Come on, you know what I
meant.

02:32.319 --> 02:33.320
- Just keep driving.

02:34.654 --> 02:36.281
- You can't leave me like this.

02:37.741 --> 02:39.618
- You're not even at 50%.

02:39.618 --> 02:40.786
I think you'll be fine.

02:44.581 --> 02:46.166
- Please.

02:46.166 --> 02:47.542
- Now you're acting like a baby.

02:48.502 --> 02:50.253
And I don't blow babies.

02:50.253 --> 02:51.213
- All right.

02:51.213 --> 02:54.633
Well, what about real hard
motherfuckers.

02:58.929 --> 03:03.433
- Hm, well maybe, if you
work real hard, motherfucker.

03:05.060 --> 03:06.770
- Look, all I need is time.

03:06.770 --> 03:07.646
All right?

03:07.646 --> 03:09.648
So why don't you come over here?

03:09.648 --> 03:10.482
And you could-

03:10.482 --> 03:13.944
Oh shit!

03:13.944 --> 03:15.153
- What the fuck?

03:27.707 --> 03:29.459
Who the fuck is that?

03:38.427 --> 03:40.262
Hey man, can I
help you with something?

03:40.262 --> 03:41.555
- I don't like this.
- Hey buddy,

03:41.555 --> 03:42.472
I'm talking to you.

03:43.890 --> 03:45.350
- Please, look,

03:45.350 --> 03:46.476
we were going to a party-

03:46.476 --> 03:47.602
- Oh my God.
- Off the road little bit.

03:47.602 --> 03:49.271
- Tyler, Tyler!
- It's not my fault-

03:49.271 --> 03:50.856
Please, please,
please.

03:50.856 --> 03:52.899
- Her mouth was on my penis.
- Tyler!

03:52.899 --> 03:53.942
- Okay.
- Tyler!

03:53.942 --> 03:55.068
Dude, let go of me.

03:55.068 --> 03:56.820
I didn't do anything.
- Please stop.

03:56.820 --> 04:01.825
Oh my goodness!

04:22.471 --> 04:24.055
- How about now?
- Nope.

04:24.931 --> 04:26.057
How about now?

04:26.057 --> 04:27.726
No honey, we
got like 30 minuets.

04:27.726 --> 04:28.685
I think we're close.

04:31.354 --> 04:32.731
me

04:32.731 --> 04:34.191
dessert

04:39.738 --> 04:41.114
- Mm.

04:41.114 --> 04:42.073
- Nice.
- Oh boy,

04:42.073 --> 04:46.786
I could use some of that.

04:46.786 --> 04:49.456
- Hey, my GPS is done.

04:49.456 --> 04:51.374
Stephanie, you got anything?

04:54.294 --> 04:56.171
- I got cell service but no GPS.

04:59.174 --> 05:01.593
- Okay, well, Alex.

05:01.593 --> 05:03.220
I need to know where to turn.

05:03.220 --> 05:04.596
So I guess that's your cue.

05:08.350 --> 05:10.185
- Is that a paper map?

05:10.185 --> 05:12.062
What are you, a Spanish
colonialists?

05:12.062 --> 05:14.856
You gonna rape and pillage my
people next?

05:14.856 --> 05:15.857
- No.

05:15.857 --> 05:16.942
Safer lines are just a trait

05:16.942 --> 05:18.360
that our generation sorely lacks

05:18.360 --> 05:19.402
and it should be practice.

05:19.402 --> 05:21.321
- Ew, just because you use a
paper map

05:21.321 --> 05:22.614
doesn't mean you're smarter than
us

05:22.614 --> 05:23.573
but by all means,

05:23.573 --> 05:24.991
bring measles to the new world.

05:24.991 --> 05:26.451
- Hey, leave Alex alone.

05:26.451 --> 05:29.120
If he wants to live
like it's 1492, let him.

05:29.955 --> 05:31.706
- I assume you're referring to
1992,

05:32.624 --> 05:34.209
I mean I'll have you guys know

05:34.209 --> 05:35.877
that maps were in heavy
circulation rarely

05:35.877 --> 05:37.087
by the early 2000s.

05:37.087 --> 05:38.338
I mean, you make it sound like
I'm longing

05:38.338 --> 05:40.632
for the meaning of the Demian
Pina Colada.

05:40.632 --> 05:41.841
What?

05:41.841 --> 05:43.552
Tell me you wouldn't love that
though?

05:43.552 --> 05:45.679
Just you on a boat with a map.

05:45.679 --> 05:46.680
Tell me you wouldn't love that.

05:46.680 --> 05:47.514
- So here's the thing.

05:47.514 --> 05:48.723
Here's why you're actually
wrong,

05:48.723 --> 05:50.475
because when you use a paper map

05:50.475 --> 05:52.602
you miss out on the raw
sensuality

05:52.602 --> 05:55.814
of having a British man.

05:55.814 --> 05:57.357
- Oh!

05:57.357 --> 05:59.568
- No, I don't need any
raw sensuality, thank you.

05:59.568 --> 06:00.652
I like the autonomy of a map,

06:00.652 --> 06:02.028
and I don't use the GPS

06:02.028 --> 06:04.239
because I don't like
being told what to do.

06:10.453 --> 06:11.955
- God.
- You know what that is?

06:11.955 --> 06:13.039
- No.

06:13.039 --> 06:14.040
- It's my bullshit detector.

06:14.040 --> 06:15.375
- Oh, okay.

06:15.375 --> 06:16.209
- Yeah.

06:16.209 --> 06:17.127
'Cause that's bullshit.
- It's true.

06:17.127 --> 06:18.128
- Do you know why you don't like
being

06:18.128 --> 06:19.629
told what to do?

06:19.629 --> 06:20.463
- Alex, it's okay.

06:20.463 --> 06:21.715
That's like the cool thing about
you

06:21.715 --> 06:23.133
that you don't know how to use a
phone.

06:23.133 --> 06:24.050
- Okay, all right, fine.

06:24.050 --> 06:26.094
I couldn't figure out how to
change the voice on my map

06:26.094 --> 06:27.053
to a British man.

06:27.053 --> 06:28.221
The lady, the man, the British
man.

06:28.221 --> 06:31.016
So you use a paper
map

06:31.016 --> 06:33.101
because you can't figure
out how to use your phone.

06:33.101 --> 06:34.311
- No, I know how to use a phone.

06:34.311 --> 06:35.979
- Wow.
- I just I couldn't figure out

06:35.979 --> 06:37.188
how to do the GPS thing.

06:37.188 --> 06:38.398
And I also didn't want to

06:38.398 --> 06:39.357
and I'm glad that I didn't.

06:39.357 --> 06:40.734
And I enjoy maps, okay,

06:40.734 --> 06:42.027
cartography is kind of my thing.

06:42.027 --> 06:43.111
- Hey.
- It's sexy.

06:43.111 --> 06:43.945
- Hey.

06:43.945 --> 06:44.863
Hey, Stephanie.

06:44.863 --> 06:45.739
Smoke your blunt.

06:45.739 --> 06:47.324
Alex.

06:47.324 --> 06:48.867
I need your map skills.

06:48.867 --> 06:49.951
Okay, tell me where I'm going.

06:49.951 --> 06:51.411
I literally have no idea.

06:51.411 --> 06:53.413
- Alright, so within a
logical margin of error

06:53.413 --> 06:54.414
to our exact location

06:54.414 --> 06:56.458
if my measurement in inches is
correct.

06:56.458 --> 06:58.293
- How many inches do you
measure,

06:58.293 --> 06:59.586
Alex, like on a good day

06:59.586 --> 07:00.962
and your best day.

07:00.962 --> 07:02.422
Bryan?

07:02.422 --> 07:03.632
- Like six and a half.

07:03.632 --> 07:04.674
- Bryan.

07:04.674 --> 07:06.051
- Seven.

07:06.051 --> 07:06.885
- Thank you.

07:06.885 --> 07:07.719
- Wow.

07:07.719 --> 07:08.637
- Within a logical margin of
error

07:08.637 --> 07:09.554
to our exact location,

07:09.554 --> 07:11.514
we should be turning left in 4
1/2 miles.

07:11.514 --> 07:14.267
- In 4.5 miles, turn left.

07:18.605 --> 07:19.439
- That is good, who was that?

07:19.439 --> 07:20.940
- John, John Linnet.

07:20.940 --> 07:21.775
It's four

07:21.775 --> 07:23.693
It's 4.5 miles, turn left.

07:23.693 --> 07:24.653
Oh my God.

07:24.653 --> 07:27.822
In 4.5 miles, turn
left.

07:27.822 --> 07:29.699
- They make some British man.

07:29.699 --> 07:30.617
- Now you're being sexist.

07:30.617 --> 07:31.910
I always knew you hated women.

07:31.910 --> 07:33.244
I don't hate women.

07:33.244 --> 07:34.663
- Who are you trying to
convince me or your self?

07:34.663 --> 07:37.082
-
probably make an exception.

07:37.082 --> 07:38.917
- What is it exactly about us,

07:38.917 --> 07:41.211
our voices, our faces. our
uteri,

07:41.211 --> 07:43.129
our ovaries, our vaginas.

07:43.129 --> 07:45.340
- I think it's all pretty
unattractive.

07:46.424 --> 07:48.176
- Wait, are you being serious?

07:49.177 --> 07:50.011
Are you trying to tell me

07:50.011 --> 07:51.638
that you actually
wouldn't want to fuck me?

07:51.638 --> 07:52.764
- No.

07:52.764 --> 07:54.057
No.

07:54.057 --> 07:55.016
- You don't want to fuck me?

07:55.016 --> 07:56.893
Just because you're gay,
you couldn't fuck a woman.

07:56.893 --> 07:57.852
That's so lame.

07:57.852 --> 07:59.270
- Well that's what it means.

07:59.270 --> 08:01.481
- You're so in the box.
- I'm not in the box

08:01.481 --> 08:02.649
and I don't want your box.

08:05.276 --> 08:06.152
- Well that's a first.

08:06.152 --> 08:07.946
- Not everyone wants to fuck
you.

08:07.946 --> 08:09.698
- Who else doesn't want to fuck
me?

08:09.698 --> 08:10.824
I don't want to fuck
you.

08:10.824 --> 08:11.658
Bryan doesn't wanna fuck you.

08:11.658 --> 08:12.826
- Besides this lame.
- Hey.

08:12.826 --> 08:14.077
Bryan doesn't wanna
fuck you.

08:14.077 --> 08:15.078
- Guys.

08:15.078 --> 08:20.083
Stop.
- But Bryan already did.

08:43.231 --> 08:45.316
I've been
doing some research on lakes

08:45.316 --> 08:46.276
in my spare time,

08:46.276 --> 08:49.237
fun fact, there's usually water
in them.

08:49.237 --> 08:51.906
- Please tell me we're
not there yet, Bryan?

08:51.906 --> 08:53.408
This is just a part of the road.

08:53.408 --> 08:54.284
Right?

08:54.284 --> 08:56.953
The lake is right around the
corner or something, Bryan?

08:58.246 --> 08:59.247
- No, this is it.

09:01.458 --> 09:02.834
This is Isola Lake.

09:04.669 --> 09:06.004
Or what's left of it, I guess.

09:06.004 --> 09:08.256
- I knew we should have looked
this shit up on the internet.

09:08.256 --> 09:09.090
You know they have pictures

09:09.090 --> 09:11.426
of the whole planet on
there, right, Bryan?

09:11.426 --> 09:12.552
Satellite pictures.

09:12.552 --> 09:15.096
- Yeah, you didn't know
about this, did you?

09:15.096 --> 09:16.639
- That the lake wasn't a lake?

09:16.639 --> 09:18.308
No, I did not know about it.

09:20.894 --> 09:22.353
Not exactly.

09:22.353 --> 09:23.271
- Not exactly.

09:23.271 --> 09:24.689
- Specificity please, honey.

09:25.648 --> 09:28.818
- My mom sent me an article
about how

09:28.818 --> 09:31.196
climate change was causing some
droughts

09:31.196 --> 09:33.907
and that Isola Lake might
be dried up in a decade,

09:33.907 --> 09:36.534
but I thought a decade was like
10 years.

09:37.577 --> 09:39.037
- I swear to god if this is some
kind

09:39.037 --> 09:41.289
of lesson on global warming.

09:41.289 --> 09:43.333
Point taken, and I hate you.

09:43.333 --> 09:44.959
- Lay off, Stephanie, he didn't
know.

09:44.959 --> 09:47.420
- I just wanted us to have a
good time.

09:47.420 --> 09:48.379
- We will.

09:48.379 --> 09:50.131
We don't need water to have a
good time.

09:50.131 --> 09:50.965
Right, Stephanie?

09:52.717 --> 09:54.052
Right, Stephanie?

09:54.052 --> 09:55.595
- Oh.

09:55.595 --> 09:56.554
Yeah, I'm ready to go home.

09:56.554 --> 09:57.764
So I'm gonna go sit in the van

09:57.764 --> 09:59.265
and wait till it takes me there.

09:59.265 --> 10:00.099
- No.

10:00.099 --> 10:01.351
Hey, I'm sorry.

10:01.351 --> 10:02.185
Okay.

10:03.144 --> 10:06.231
I should have looked it up.
- No.

10:06.231 --> 10:08.525
Hey, we can still have fun.

10:08.525 --> 10:09.359
We still have weed.

10:09.359 --> 10:10.276
We still have the van.

10:10.276 --> 10:11.110
We still have each other.

10:11.110 --> 10:13.279
I mean, the only thing
that's missing is the lake.

10:13.279 --> 10:14.447
- Oh, was there a lake?

10:14.447 --> 10:15.740
God, I must have missed it,

10:15.740 --> 10:18.952
in the middle of all this
fucking desert.

10:18.952 --> 10:19.786
Can you stop pretending

10:19.786 --> 10:20.870
like you care about the water

10:20.870 --> 10:22.956
'cause you live in Santa Monica.

10:22.956 --> 10:23.957
- And?

10:23.957 --> 10:24.874
- If you wanted water,

10:24.874 --> 10:25.834
you would have stayed home

10:25.834 --> 10:27.919
but you practically beg
to come on this trip.

10:27.919 --> 10:30.839
- I'm tired of saltwater and
I wanted to cock block you.

10:30.839 --> 10:32.048
You don't know my life.

10:32.048 --> 10:32.882
- Hm.

10:32.882 --> 10:34.342
We all know why you're here.

10:34.342 --> 10:36.135
You're trying to forget about
David.

10:39.264 --> 10:41.057
- I'm about to try and forget
about you.

10:41.057 --> 10:42.350
- Am I wrong?

10:42.350 --> 10:44.310
- No, you're not fucking wrong.

10:44.310 --> 10:45.144
You're right.

10:45.144 --> 10:46.729
But if you keep bringing him up,

10:46.729 --> 10:47.981
I can't forget about him.

10:47.981 --> 10:49.023
Can I?
- Okay, okay.

10:50.191 --> 10:51.109
Can we stop?

10:52.402 --> 10:53.236
Please.

10:54.195 --> 10:55.029
Please.

10:55.947 --> 10:56.781
Please.

10:58.449 --> 10:59.284
Okay.

11:01.536 --> 11:02.912
If you want to go home,

11:03.830 --> 11:05.623
I can get us back in like six
hours.

11:05.623 --> 11:06.457
- Hm.

11:06.457 --> 11:07.292
Probably more like a eight,

11:07.292 --> 11:08.793
cause' we'll be hitting
traffic on the way back.

11:08.793 --> 11:12.881
- Alex, I love you, but not
right now.

11:12.881 --> 11:13.715
- I love you too.

11:13.715 --> 11:14.549
And sorry.

11:14.549 --> 11:16.176
I'll shut up, okay, back to you.

11:19.095 --> 11:21.514
- What do you want to do, Steph?

11:25.810 --> 11:27.103
- We're already here.

11:28.271 --> 11:29.898
I'm tired of being cooped up
anyway.

11:29.898 --> 11:31.441
- Yes!

11:31.441 --> 11:33.234
That's my bad bitch.

11:33.234 --> 11:34.068
Ah.

11:35.028 --> 11:36.863
Ha!
- What are you doing?

11:36.863 --> 11:38.531
- She likes when I do this
dance.

11:38.531 --> 11:39.574
- Honey, where did you pick that
up?

11:39.574 --> 11:40.617
I don't like when you dance like
that.

11:40.617 --> 11:42.410
- You will.
- Baby, no, please.

11:42.410 --> 11:43.494
No.

11:43.494 --> 11:44.913
- Don't you like this dance?

11:45.788 --> 11:46.623
- I like the dance.
- You do!

11:46.623 --> 11:47.707
You like the dance!

11:47.707 --> 11:48.541
- Yeah, I like the dance.

11:48.541 --> 11:49.542
- I like you.

11:50.585 --> 11:53.087
- Plus, somebody's gotta
smoke all the weed.

11:53.087 --> 11:55.506
- Yes, and this is a very good

11:55.506 --> 11:57.634
learning opportunity for all of
us.

11:57.634 --> 11:58.468
Because I've always wondered

11:58.468 --> 11:59.719
what it looked like at
the bottom of the lake.

11:59.719 --> 12:01.763
- Get me a cement block and I'll
show you.

12:01.763 --> 12:03.890
- No, you can't actually
kill him, you know.

12:03.890 --> 12:04.724
I can't?

12:04.724 --> 12:05.558
- No.
- You sure?

12:18.529 --> 12:19.364
- Actually feel like I'm gonna
get like

12:19.364 --> 12:20.698
some really good shots out here

12:20.698 --> 12:23.660
'cause this terrain is sick.

12:23.660 --> 12:25.912
- Your 17 followers will be
psyched.

12:25.912 --> 12:29.791
- 734 actually, you'd know
that if you followed me.

12:29.791 --> 12:31.334
- I do follow you.

12:31.334 --> 12:33.044
You follow my
personal page.

12:33.044 --> 12:35.004
- Oh, okay, so I'm not a good
friend

12:35.004 --> 12:37.131
unless I follow your
photography account too.

12:37.131 --> 12:38.257
- No, you're a good friend.

12:38.257 --> 12:40.426
You're just a shitty fan.

12:40.426 --> 12:42.929
- Well, I tapped out when you
put a filter

12:42.929 --> 12:46.182
on a bowl of cereal and
captioned it food-spiration.

12:46.182 --> 12:48.017
- Yeah, I was being ironic.

12:48.017 --> 12:49.435
- I don't think that landed,
buddy.

12:49.435 --> 12:51.270
- Okay.
- Post a decent photo

12:51.270 --> 12:52.105
and I'll follow you.

12:52.105 --> 12:53.189
- I love your photography.

12:53.189 --> 12:54.732
- Thank you, Alex.
- Love?

12:54.732 --> 12:56.234
That's a big word.

12:56.234 --> 12:58.528
You shouldn't throw that
around all willy-nilly.

12:58.528 --> 12:59.946
- If I didn't mean it, I
wouldn't say it.

12:59.946 --> 13:01.489
- It's true.
- Yeah, okay.

13:01.489 --> 13:03.533
I'm gonna go see how high I can
get,

13:03.533 --> 13:05.535
you guys chase the good
lighting.

13:06.411 --> 13:07.578
- Are you gonna be okay?

13:07.578 --> 13:09.247
- Oh, don't fucking ask me that.

13:10.540 --> 13:11.791
- Don't kill yourself.

13:13.126 --> 13:14.377
Alex, wait up.

13:14.377 --> 13:15.837
Oh, you're coming with
me?

13:15.837 --> 13:16.921
Hey, don't be like
that.

13:16.921 --> 13:17.755
I'm sorry.

13:17.755 --> 13:18.965
It was supposed to just
be us.

13:18.965 --> 13:21.342
- I know, but you saw what a
mess she was.

13:21.342 --> 13:22.218
She just needs a friend.

13:22.218 --> 13:24.595
- She doesn't have any other
friends?

13:24.595 --> 13:25.805
- I said I'm sorry.

13:25.805 --> 13:27.890
- She's just been up my
ass this entire time,

13:27.890 --> 13:29.350
and not in a good way.

13:29.350 --> 13:30.643
I'm trying to be on her team

13:30.643 --> 13:31.936
about this whole getting cheated
on thing,

13:31.936 --> 13:33.730
but it's all starting to make
sense.

13:33.730 --> 13:35.565
I understand.

13:35.565 --> 13:36.399
And I'm sorry.

13:36.399 --> 13:37.608
Okay?

13:37.608 --> 13:38.735
I thought it was okay.

13:40.028 --> 13:41.195
What can I do to fix it?

13:45.491 --> 13:46.367
- This is helping.

13:47.326 --> 13:48.870
You make it really hard
to stay mad at you.

13:48.870 --> 13:50.204
You know that?
- I do know that.

13:50.204 --> 13:51.039
- Yeah?

13:52.957 --> 13:56.085
- I promise that we will
do this again very soon.

13:56.085 --> 13:56.919
Just you and me.

13:57.962 --> 13:58.796
Okay.

13:59.839 --> 14:01.215
But she needs this.

14:02.050 --> 14:04.218
Did I tell you that David's
like camping outside

14:04.218 --> 14:05.636
of her apartment lifting
weights,

14:05.636 --> 14:07.764
so she can, she sees him every
day?

14:07.764 --> 14:09.766
- Yeah, I know, I heard
you guys talking about it.

14:09.766 --> 14:10.600
- I thought you were sleeping.

14:10.600 --> 14:13.269
- I was until she saw that
picture of him and Cassie.

14:13.269 --> 14:14.103
- Oh, God.

14:16.397 --> 14:18.107
- But, I get it.

14:18.107 --> 14:20.068
I mean, as much as it sucks,

14:20.068 --> 14:21.986
the fact that you are
willing to be this nice

14:21.986 --> 14:24.405
to a friend, it's very sweet.

14:24.405 --> 14:25.865
Thank you.

14:29.202 --> 14:31.079
And thanks for sticking up for
me too.

14:32.413 --> 14:35.166
But you don't have to say
that you like my pictures.

14:35.166 --> 14:36.292
- I do like your pictures.

14:36.292 --> 14:37.376
- Do you?

14:37.376 --> 14:38.211
- No.

14:38.211 --> 14:40.463
And it is not your fault
that the lake got dried up.

14:40.463 --> 14:42.298
- I know it's not my fault.

14:42.298 --> 14:45.259
It's the corporations and the
meat eaters!

14:45.259 --> 14:46.302
- Yeah.

14:46.302 --> 14:48.805
You are always on your IRS
about these meat eaters.

14:48.805 --> 14:49.680
- Well.

14:49.680 --> 14:50.515
- Well.

14:50.515 --> 14:51.849
You know I've never heard you
complain

14:51.849 --> 14:52.934
about my meat eating.

14:52.934 --> 14:54.769
- Oh, please don't compare my
penis

14:54.769 --> 14:56.020
to a dead animal part.

14:56.020 --> 14:59.273
- Like you know, just big
tenderloin raw,

14:59.273 --> 15:02.693
covered, uncut circumcised
between your legs.

15:02.693 --> 15:03.528
Between my legs.

15:03.528 --> 15:04.362
And my butt hole.

15:04.362 --> 15:05.988
Yeah, baby!

15:25.091 --> 15:25.925
- Hello?

15:31.639 --> 15:34.892
If you're a bobcat, I will fuck
you up.

15:38.729 --> 15:40.565
There is nothing there, Steph.

15:40.565 --> 15:42.233
You're acting like a crazy
person.

15:48.072 --> 15:49.073
God damn it.

15:50.032 --> 15:50.867
- I thought you were gonna have

15:50.867 --> 15:53.369
this super amazing time without
me.

15:53.369 --> 15:54.829
That's not what this looks like.

15:54.829 --> 15:57.748
- I left you behind for a
reason, asshole.

15:57.748 --> 15:59.709
Why do you gotta show up and
ruin it?

15:59.709 --> 16:01.544
- You brought me here.

16:01.544 --> 16:03.254
- And I'm leaving you here.

16:04.505 --> 16:06.924
- Typical, avoiding
confrontation.

16:06.924 --> 16:09.343
- No, I'm avoiding you.

16:09.343 --> 16:11.721
- But you can't stop thinking
about me.

16:12.972 --> 16:14.390
Can you?

16:14.390 --> 16:15.391
I mean, I get it.

16:20.271 --> 16:23.357
- Oh Bryan, there's a
beautiful patch of dirt.

16:23.357 --> 16:24.817
It's just remarkable.

16:24.817 --> 16:25.776
- Okay.

16:25.776 --> 16:27.111
You know I'm not just taking
pictures

16:27.111 --> 16:29.822
of random patches of dirt,

16:29.822 --> 16:31.699
I'm choosing them specifically.

16:31.699 --> 16:33.201
This is art.

16:33.201 --> 16:34.202
- I know.

16:34.202 --> 16:35.036
Sorry.

16:35.953 --> 16:37.538
Tell me about what you're doing?

16:39.373 --> 16:41.584
- Okay, do you see this crack
here,

16:41.584 --> 16:43.878
how it splits and then goes

16:43.878 --> 16:46.297
into three different directions?

16:46.297 --> 16:47.215
Yeah.

16:47.215 --> 16:48.799
- And then see how they all meet
back up,

16:48.799 --> 16:49.717
right over there.

16:49.717 --> 16:50.551
- Yeah.

16:52.094 --> 16:55.181
- It's just this like
feeling of uncertainty.

16:55.181 --> 16:57.266
And how pointless it is.

16:58.726 --> 16:59.560
- You know that you could choose

16:59.560 --> 17:00.937
any path to get where it's
going,

17:00.937 --> 17:03.064
but it always ends up in the
same space.

17:04.690 --> 17:06.776
Which path is the correct one?

17:06.776 --> 17:07.902
I don't know, it's just

17:09.862 --> 17:11.572
we agonize over these decisions

17:11.572 --> 17:15.284
and just go different trails
trying

17:15.284 --> 17:16.410
to figure out which way to go,

17:16.410 --> 17:18.079
not knowing that we're always
gonna end up

17:18.079 --> 17:19.247
in the same space.

17:22.416 --> 17:24.835
Really, choice doesn't matter.

17:26.254 --> 17:27.546
There's no correct path.

17:28.965 --> 17:29.882
Everything ends.

17:31.634 --> 17:33.010
- And it looks like a butt.

17:34.428 --> 17:35.346
- That's what I was trying to
say,

17:35.346 --> 17:36.389
it looks like a butt.

17:38.057 --> 17:38.891
- With a crack.

17:40.559 --> 17:43.604
- Now you're getting it.
- Yeah, butt crack.

17:43.604 --> 17:45.481
Here, will
you take a picture of me

17:45.481 --> 17:46.774
for my personal account.
- Oh, yeah babe.

17:46.774 --> 17:48.526
Just like right over
here.

17:52.029 --> 17:52.905
Nice.

17:53.990 --> 17:55.783
- I want to find lighting over
here.

17:58.202 --> 18:00.705
- Is this your fantasy version
of me?

18:00.705 --> 18:02.248
You can't even see the muscles.

18:03.457 --> 18:05.084
Need some help?
- Not from you.

18:06.002 --> 18:07.378
- What are you looking for?

18:08.713 --> 18:10.589
- Something to make you
disappear.

18:14.510 --> 18:16.887
10 minutes and I'll be back on
vacation.

18:16.887 --> 18:19.890
- Do you ever truly feel
like you're not alone?

18:19.890 --> 18:22.643
- How can I be alone
when I'm with my friends?

18:22.643 --> 18:23.936
- That's a good question.

18:23.936 --> 18:25.187
Mine's better.

18:25.187 --> 18:27.440
- This conversation is over!

18:27.440 --> 18:28.316
Okay?

18:28.316 --> 18:29.650
This cannot go on.

18:29.650 --> 18:31.277
When I get back to LA I better
find out

18:31.277 --> 18:34.155
that you stayed here and you
fucking dieD.

18:34.155 --> 18:37.241
God!

18:47.043 --> 18:47.877
I was really hoping there'd be

18:47.877 --> 18:49.337
someone I could fuck out here.

18:52.798 --> 18:54.634
- I wish we had like a
tumbleweed that rolled by.

18:54.634 --> 18:56.427
- Yeah, nice, honey.
- You know.

18:56.427 --> 18:57.636
What should I do?

18:57.636 --> 18:58.929
- Are you flexing?

18:58.929 --> 19:00.931
- I can.

19:00.931 --> 19:03.517
Climate changes is real!

19:03.517 --> 19:05.561
- Honey, how do I know if
the camera was working?

19:05.561 --> 19:06.520
Does it click or anything?

19:06.520 --> 19:08.773
- Do you see me?
- In the thing? No.

19:11.108 --> 19:12.818
- Steph just texted,

19:12.818 --> 19:14.487
"Got high, taking a nap."

19:15.571 --> 19:19.075
She usually sleeps for a few
hours when she gets high.

19:19.075 --> 19:20.242
- Can we get that high?

19:21.202 --> 19:22.495
- You can get as high as you
want.

19:22.495 --> 19:23.329
I gotta drive.

19:24.413 --> 19:25.831
- Does that mean we're leaving?

19:25.831 --> 19:28.834
- I mean, wouldn't you rather
drive home while she's asleep?

19:30.878 --> 19:32.755
Wait!

19:33.839 --> 19:34.673
Wait.

19:36.092 --> 19:37.218
Fucking shoes.

19:37.218 --> 19:38.886
- And it really wasn't that bad.

19:38.886 --> 19:39.929
- You don't think so?

19:41.055 --> 19:41.889
I mean, that being
said,

19:41.889 --> 19:43.265
I'm doing the next one.

19:43.265 --> 19:45.017
And I'm not inviting Stephanie.

19:45.017 --> 19:46.685
And I'm getting a free blowjob.

19:46.685 --> 19:49.063
Okay, you can
have that whenever you want.

19:49.063 --> 19:50.106
Look at my muscles.

19:50.106 --> 19:51.857
You're getting tan.

19:51.857 --> 19:53.192
Am I now?

19:53.192 --> 19:54.860
- I love that.
- Yeah?

19:54.860 --> 19:56.362
- Yeah.
- Thank you.

20:00.825 --> 20:03.828
missing part

20:03.828 --> 20:06.747
breathe

20:11.752 --> 20:13.796
- We should end this trip on a
high note.

20:15.339 --> 20:16.882
- You're already a high note.

20:18.592 --> 20:19.593
- I'm horny.

20:20.678 --> 20:23.347
I want to eat all your dead
animal parts.

20:25.266 --> 20:26.684
- Stephanie's right there.

20:26.684 --> 20:28.310
- I bet I can do it without
waking her up.

20:28.310 --> 20:29.603
- I don't know if I can do it,

20:29.603 --> 20:32.565
without driving off the road.
- Into what?

20:39.488 --> 20:41.031
Drive off the road, for all I
care.

20:41.031 --> 20:41.866
I feel very safe.

20:48.038 --> 20:48.914
- You're crazy.

20:48.914 --> 20:50.541
- Take off your pants.

20:58.799 --> 21:00.217
- I can't believe we're going
this.

21:00.217 --> 21:01.927
- You're not doing anything,
babe.

21:01.927 --> 21:03.345
You were just driving through
the desert.

21:03.345 --> 21:06.140
And I'm gonna taking care of the
rest.

21:06.140 --> 21:08.893
- You always get so horny when
you smoke.

21:08.893 --> 21:10.895
Oh!

21:10.895 --> 21:12.938
Ah, that's good, that's good.

21:12.938 --> 21:13.939
That's good.

21:16.108 --> 21:16.984
Oh.

21:35.252 --> 21:36.545
Fuck!

21:36.545 --> 21:37.379
Ouch.

21:37.379 --> 21:38.547
- Why did you slam on the
brakes?

21:38.547 --> 21:40.090
- Why did you bite my dick?

21:40.090 --> 21:41.217
- Well, I'm awake.

21:41.217 --> 21:43.511
- Because it was in my mouth
when you slammed on the brakes.

21:43.511 --> 21:44.637
- Fuck!
- Are you okay?

21:44.637 --> 21:47.890
- Oh fuck, you bit my fucking
dick, Alex.

21:47.890 --> 21:48.974
- Did he bite it off?

21:48.974 --> 21:49.808
- What?

21:49.808 --> 21:50.643
- Is it still attached?

21:50.643 --> 21:52.728
- Yes, but it's like bleeding,

21:52.728 --> 21:53.729
he broke skin.

21:53.729 --> 21:54.855
- Then you're fucking fine,

21:54.855 --> 21:57.024
my dick bleeds once a month.

21:57.024 --> 21:58.609
- Ew!

21:58.609 --> 21:59.610
- Why did we stop?

22:01.904 --> 22:02.821
- Look.

22:10.246 --> 22:11.580
- What the fuck?

22:16.627 --> 22:18.754
Those are human heads.

22:18.754 --> 22:20.297
- Duh.

22:20.297 --> 22:22.007
- I've never seen human heads.

22:22.007 --> 22:23.342
We see
human heads every day.

22:23.342 --> 22:24.426
- Yeah, on bodies.

22:24.426 --> 22:25.594
Oh.
- Okay, we need to get you

22:25.594 --> 22:26.428
to a hospital.

22:26.428 --> 22:27.846
Is there one nearby?
- I don't know.

22:27.846 --> 22:29.515
Alex, why don't you check the
map?

22:29.515 --> 22:31.934
- He don't need a fucking
hospital.

22:31.934 --> 22:33.936
- Yes, he does.
- So do they.

22:33.936 --> 22:36.272
- No, no, they don't.

22:36.272 --> 22:38.232
No one present needs a hospital.

22:38.232 --> 22:41.026
- My dick got bit!

22:41.026 --> 22:41.860
- So what?

22:41.860 --> 22:43.237
I've had plenty of boyfriends

22:43.237 --> 22:44.822
who like when I use a little
teeth.

22:44.822 --> 22:45.656
Your dick is fine,

22:45.656 --> 22:46.782
just like their dicks are fine.

22:46.782 --> 22:48.867
- Didn't Travis' dick fall off?

22:48.867 --> 22:50.619
- That was the nurses fault.
- Okay.

22:50.619 --> 22:52.997
Are we gonna ignore the
human heads on the road?

22:53.872 --> 22:57.126
- There's not much we can
do for them at this point.

22:57.126 --> 22:58.836
Well, someone
should say something.

23:04.341 --> 23:06.385
- Rest ye in peace,

23:06.385 --> 23:09.930
oh souls of these heads.

23:09.930 --> 23:11.265
- This seems disrespectful.

23:15.644 --> 23:18.731
- If thy had but thy bodies,

23:18.731 --> 23:23.736
perhaps we would grab
a beer with the thusly.

23:24.028 --> 23:24.820
- Amen.

23:26.363 --> 23:28.657
- These weren't here when we
drove in.

23:28.657 --> 23:29.700
- Are you sure?

23:29.700 --> 23:30.618
- Yes, Alex.

23:30.618 --> 23:32.828
I'm sure I would have seen them.

23:32.828 --> 23:33.996
Someone put these here.

23:34.955 --> 23:36.790
- Then they're still nearby?

23:36.790 --> 23:38.042
- I'm calling the police.

23:40.252 --> 23:41.170
- Good idea.
- Hi.

23:43.756 --> 23:46.634
We are at Isola Lake

23:46.634 --> 23:51.347
and we just found two severed
human heads.

23:51.347 --> 23:52.181
- Why did you bite my dick?

23:52.181 --> 23:53.390
- I didn't mean to bite you
dick.

23:53.390 --> 23:55.017
- I know you didn't mean to bite
my dick

23:55.017 --> 23:55.851
but even still,

23:55.851 --> 23:58.145
you bit my dick.
- I was trying to be fun.

23:58.145 --> 24:00.230
It's not fun, Alex, it's
bleeding.

24:00.230 --> 24:01.231
- Oh, hold on a sec.

24:02.066 --> 24:03.734
Where exactly are we?

24:03.734 --> 24:04.943
- I don't know, the middle of a
lake?

24:04.943 --> 24:05.986
- I'll go get my map.

24:07.237 --> 24:08.489
- Alex, wait!

24:08.489 --> 24:09.490
Stay close.

24:09.490 --> 24:12.076
- Okay, we're finding out,
we're not sure just yet.

24:13.202 --> 24:14.370
No.

24:14.370 --> 24:16.622
I'm aware.

24:16.622 --> 24:18.290
Yes, I know.

24:18.290 --> 24:19.958
Well, I don't fucking know,

24:19.958 --> 24:22.044
why can't you just track the
call

24:22.044 --> 24:24.922
based on my location or
something?

24:25.881 --> 24:26.840
Not possible?

24:26.840 --> 24:28.676
You-
- Steph, calm down.

24:28.676 --> 24:30.386
- You were able to locate my
brother

24:30.386 --> 24:31.970
when he was trying to do street
art

24:31.970 --> 24:33.347
and you're gonna tell
me it's not possible.

24:33.347 --> 24:34.473
I have two heads.

24:34.473 --> 24:35.724
- Try a different tone.

24:35.724 --> 24:36.684
- Okay, well,

24:36.684 --> 24:38.227
how long will that take?

24:39.728 --> 24:40.562
What?

24:41.980 --> 24:44.441
Look, why don't you just tell an
officer

24:44.441 --> 24:46.276
to come out to Lake Isola,

24:46.276 --> 24:48.904
and just stop whenever he
sees the two human heads

24:48.904 --> 24:49.738
in the middle of the lake?

24:49.738 --> 24:50.572
Okay?

24:50.572 --> 24:51.990
Okay? Great.

24:51.990 --> 24:53.909
Thank you so much.

24:54.952 --> 24:55.786
Bitch.

24:57.871 --> 24:58.747
They're sending someone.

24:58.747 --> 25:00.290
- That's great.

25:00.290 --> 25:01.667
- No, I don't think they're
gonna

25:01.667 --> 25:03.585
be able to find us.

25:03.585 --> 25:05.838
We gotta get the fuck out of
here.

25:09.341 --> 25:11.343
What the fuck.

25:14.555 --> 25:15.389
- Hello.

25:19.017 --> 25:20.060
Can we help you?

25:21.687 --> 25:22.813
We come in peace.

25:22.813 --> 25:25.357
- Are you fucking kidding me,
Alex?

25:25.357 --> 25:26.191
- What.

25:27.818 --> 25:29.236
Are you okay?

25:29.236 --> 25:30.070
- Alex, don't.

25:32.114 --> 25:32.948
- Do you need water?

25:32.948 --> 25:34.324
'Cause we have water.

25:38.662 --> 25:41.790
- He's probably the one
that put the heads there.

25:41.790 --> 25:44.293
- I think it's wrong to assume
things about a stranger.

25:44.293 --> 25:46.754
Ah, maybe that's for clearing
brush.

25:46.754 --> 25:48.922
- You think he's gonna
behead the brush, Alex?

25:48.922 --> 25:51.717
For someone so smart, you're
acting like a fucking idiot.

25:52.801 --> 25:54.136
- Maybe he's deaf.

25:55.429 --> 25:56.430
I love your outfit.

25:58.015 --> 25:59.558
It's adorable.

25:59.558 --> 26:00.726
Very chic.

26:00.726 --> 26:01.977
Can you hear me?

26:01.977 --> 26:04.062
- If he's deaf, complimenting
him

26:04.062 --> 26:06.482
and then yelling louder
wouldn't help, would it?

26:07.316 --> 26:10.110
- I think he wants to cut off
our heads.

26:10.110 --> 26:11.820
- I just, he hasn't done
anything yet

26:11.820 --> 26:12.780
and I think it's wrong to just
assume.

26:12.780 --> 26:16.366
- Holy shit!

26:26.835 --> 26:27.669
- Bryan!

26:28.837 --> 26:30.047
Bryan, get up.

26:30.047 --> 26:31.924
Bryan, he's right behind you!

26:33.133 --> 26:34.635
Bryan!

26:34.635 --> 26:35.469
No.

27:06.708 --> 27:07.543
- Wait.

27:19.096 --> 27:20.764
- Oh my god!

27:20.764 --> 27:22.182
Bryan is dead.

27:22.182 --> 27:23.559
Bryan is dead!

27:23.559 --> 27:24.393
- I know.

27:24.393 --> 27:25.811
- What the fuck are we gonna do?

27:25.811 --> 27:27.062
- Stay calm!

27:27.062 --> 27:28.146
We have to figure it out.

27:28.146 --> 27:28.981
- Figure what out?

27:28.981 --> 27:31.733
Bryan is dead and that medieval
fair reject has our van.

27:31.733 --> 27:33.193
- Well we'll get the van back.

27:33.193 --> 27:34.695
We just need a plan.

27:41.493 --> 27:43.287
- Oh my god, Stephanie, he's
coming.

27:44.162 --> 27:45.664
Run!

27:47.583 --> 27:48.834
- He's gonna run us over!

27:48.834 --> 27:50.168
- Don't let him!

27:53.463 --> 27:54.298
Split up!

28:03.765 --> 28:05.642
What the fuck?

28:05.642 --> 28:07.102
That doesn't make
any sense.

28:07.102 --> 28:09.146
- Why didn't he try to kill us?

28:09.146 --> 28:10.397
- I don't know.

28:12.107 --> 28:13.942
But I'm gonna get that van back.

28:16.445 --> 28:17.905
- You're gonna follow him?

28:17.905 --> 28:20.073
- I will do whatever it takes.

28:20.073 --> 28:21.033
I want to get home.

28:52.230 --> 28:54.858
God damn it, get down.

28:54.858 --> 28:55.692
Do you see that?

28:57.235 --> 28:59.947
- I see an old camper and
I see a bunch of junk.

28:59.947 --> 29:02.532
- Does it look like anyone lives
there?

29:02.532 --> 29:04.117
- I can't tell.

29:04.117 --> 29:05.619
- Give me those fucking things.

29:05.619 --> 29:06.495
- Nice.

29:06.495 --> 29:07.371
- Give them to me.

29:10.958 --> 29:12.292
I don't see our van anywhere.

29:12.292 --> 29:13.251
- It's Bryan's van.

29:15.337 --> 29:17.506
- I'm gonna go check it out.

29:17.506 --> 29:19.132
Maybe you could start up that
camper

29:19.132 --> 29:21.259
and just drive us the fuck out
of here.

29:21.259 --> 29:22.719
- What, what?

29:22.719 --> 29:24.846
Stephanie, the killer could be
in there.

29:24.846 --> 29:25.973
He could have a gun.

29:25.973 --> 29:27.307
- Didn't ask you to come.

29:28.725 --> 29:30.602
- Wait, Stephanie!

29:30.602 --> 29:31.937
Fuck!

29:31.937 --> 29:33.981
Fucking fuck, fuck, fuck.

29:36.233 --> 29:37.067
Damn it!

29:45.909 --> 29:48.036
What the fuck are
you doing?

29:48.036 --> 29:49.830
You look like a goddamn troll.

29:50.747 --> 29:52.582
Just, I'm staying out
of sight.

29:52.582 --> 29:55.002
Well, I can
fucking see you, Alex.

29:59.464 --> 30:00.882
- Doesn't look like that
thing is gonna move.

30:00.882 --> 30:01.842
- Yeah, no shit.

30:01.842 --> 30:03.552
But it also doesn't look
like anybody lives here.

30:03.552 --> 30:04.720
- Right and it also didn't look
like

30:04.720 --> 30:07.097
a cartoon murderer lived
at the lake either.

30:07.097 --> 30:07.931
- Shut the fuck up.

30:07.931 --> 30:08.807
I'm gonna try the door.

30:08.807 --> 30:10.017
- Why, why?

30:10.017 --> 30:11.184
Oh my God.

30:11.184 --> 30:13.979
Because, Alex, then we can see
if we can find an old piece

30:13.979 --> 30:15.397
of mail with an address on it.

30:15.397 --> 30:17.566
To help the police find us,

30:17.566 --> 30:19.317
or some food or water or
something.

30:22.112 --> 30:23.196
- What if there is someone
inside

30:23.196 --> 30:25.532
and what if it was gonna kill
us?

30:25.532 --> 30:27.451
- It's our only chance.

30:34.458 --> 30:35.292
Is anybody there?

30:39.379 --> 30:41.048
Doesn't seem like anyone's home.

30:59.566 --> 31:01.318
- I don't wanna.

31:01.318 --> 31:02.235
But I will.

31:08.742 --> 31:09.576
- Shit.

31:10.869 --> 31:12.287
He lives here.

31:12.287 --> 31:14.414
- I fucking told you he was in
here.

31:14.414 --> 31:16.416
My God, I'm gonna choke.

31:17.876 --> 31:18.710
- Water.

31:20.754 --> 31:21.588
Here.

31:21.588 --> 31:23.006
Here! It's warm but it'll help.

31:26.885 --> 31:27.886
The fuck.

31:27.886 --> 31:28.720
- What?

31:28.720 --> 31:30.388
What, what the fuck?

31:31.765 --> 31:32.641
- Sh.

31:32.641 --> 31:33.725
- No, no, no.

31:53.370 --> 31:56.623
- Ah!

32:10.220 --> 32:12.013
- He's here!
- What?

32:12.013 --> 32:13.181
- And he has his sword.

32:14.975 --> 32:17.310
- Fuck, okay, all right.

32:17.310 --> 32:18.812
I need a minuet to think.

32:18.812 --> 32:20.438
I think he has,

32:20.438 --> 32:21.648
if he's here then the van is
here.

32:21.648 --> 32:23.150
Over that ridge, right?

32:23.150 --> 32:24.234
Right?

32:24.234 --> 32:25.485
Alex!

32:25.485 --> 32:28.071
Alex, the one time I
need your logical brain

32:28.071 --> 32:30.115
and you're fucking shutting
down, what good are you?

32:30.115 --> 32:31.241
- Fuck you, Stephanie.

32:31.241 --> 32:32.242
We're gonna die in here.

32:32.242 --> 32:33.368
- Okay.

32:33.368 --> 32:34.411
Weapons.

32:34.411 --> 32:36.329
Weapons, weapons, weapons.

32:37.998 --> 32:39.875
No, not now.

32:39.875 --> 32:40.750
Really?
- No?

32:40.750 --> 32:41.585
No what?

32:41.585 --> 32:42.419
- Fuck!

32:42.419 --> 32:43.962
- Is this your new place?

32:43.962 --> 32:45.380
It's much nicer than the old
one.

32:45.380 --> 32:46.214
Okay, you didn't seem to mind it

32:46.214 --> 32:48.425
when you live there rent free,
asshole.

32:48.425 --> 32:50.010
- Yeah, we put up with a lot of
bullshit

32:50.010 --> 32:51.511
when you're in a relationship.

32:53.013 --> 32:54.014
You need my help.

32:54.014 --> 32:54.973
That's why I'm-

32:54.973 --> 32:56.808
- No I absolutely do not need
your help.

32:56.808 --> 32:57.642
- I fucking need your help,
please.

32:57.642 --> 32:59.352
Who the fuck are you talking to?

33:00.520 --> 33:01.354
- I need you.

33:02.731 --> 33:04.316
I need you.

33:04.316 --> 33:05.150
- You need me

33:05.150 --> 33:06.568
- Shut the fuck up.

33:06.568 --> 33:08.111
Look, we gotta get to the van.

33:08.111 --> 33:09.321
Right? Right?

33:09.321 --> 33:10.488
And I got a plan.

33:10.488 --> 33:11.323
I do.

33:13.742 --> 33:15.702
- I never appreciated how smart
you are.

33:15.702 --> 33:16.536
- Shut up!

33:17.787 --> 33:20.248
We don't have much time, Alex.

33:20.248 --> 33:21.791
Alex.

33:21.791 --> 33:23.752
Alex, I am not gonna die

33:23.752 --> 33:25.503
because you are too chicken shit
to help.

33:25.503 --> 33:27.380
All right, you woman up.

33:27.380 --> 33:28.548
You got this.

33:29.591 --> 33:30.550
Decent pep talk.

33:30.550 --> 33:31.593
I almost bought that.

33:33.803 --> 33:35.347
- He's getting close.

33:35.347 --> 33:37.474
We go on my say.

33:37.474 --> 33:38.975
- Go where on your say?

33:38.975 --> 33:40.602
- No matter what happens,

33:40.602 --> 33:42.103
you get back to that van.

34:23.520 --> 34:24.354
- Fuck!

34:26.189 --> 34:27.440
- Nice, babe.

34:27.440 --> 34:29.109
You are so powerful.

34:29.109 --> 34:31.528
- I don't need your validation.

34:32.487 --> 34:35.782
- The keys aren't there!

34:48.378 --> 34:51.172
- That's a second best
friend you've killed today.

34:51.172 --> 34:52.048
- Stephanie! No keys!

34:52.048 --> 34:55.135
- Then just bust out a
window and hot wire it.

34:55.135 --> 34:56.928
- I don't know how to hot wire a
car!

34:56.928 --> 34:59.389
- God damn it, what use are
you?!

34:59.389 --> 35:00.223
- I don't know,

35:00.223 --> 35:01.433
I guess I'm good company.

35:03.852 --> 35:05.353
- Get out of my way. David.

35:08.315 --> 35:10.483
- You know this is all your
fault, right?

35:10.483 --> 35:11.401
You realize that?

35:12.444 --> 35:16.281
Bryan died because our
relationship died.

35:16.281 --> 35:18.867
You should have never left,
Stephanie.

35:18.867 --> 35:19.784
Come home to me.

35:19.784 --> 35:22.287
- You don't think I know
this is all my fault?

35:22.287 --> 35:24.581
We will fucking talk about this
later.

35:24.581 --> 35:26.458
- Stephanie, get out of there.

35:31.129 --> 35:34.299
Fuck you and your
sword.

35:36.801 --> 35:37.761
- Look at you.

35:37.761 --> 35:38.595
All right.

35:41.806 --> 35:44.059
- We're just gonna let him win?

35:44.059 --> 35:45.101
- Stephanie!

35:45.101 --> 35:45.935
Come on, man.

35:45.935 --> 35:46.770
You're cut open.

35:46.770 --> 35:47.896
- I'm fine.

35:47.896 --> 35:48.897
Ow!

35:52.400 --> 35:53.401
Yeah, that's right bitch.

35:53.401 --> 35:54.778
We won.

35:54.778 --> 35:55.737
Fucker.

35:55.737 --> 35:56.571
- No, no, no.

35:56.571 --> 35:57.405
We lost, I'm sorry.
- Fuck you.

35:57.405 --> 35:58.239
- Okay, get out of here.

35:58.239 --> 36:00.367
Okay, no, no, no.
- Stupid fucking face.

36:00.367 --> 36:01.534
Yeah, we lost.

36:07.374 --> 36:10.001
- When I see that motherfucker
again,

36:10.001 --> 36:12.087
I'm gonna cut his head off

36:12.087 --> 36:13.671
and wear it as a goddamn hat.

36:15.757 --> 36:16.591
Fuck him.

36:17.676 --> 36:19.094
Fuck his mother.

36:19.094 --> 36:20.845
Fuck his whole fucking family.

36:22.097 --> 36:23.098
- Do we have a plan?

36:24.557 --> 36:26.101
- We have to find a checkpoint.

36:27.185 --> 36:32.023
And then we can call the police

36:32.023 --> 36:34.109
and then maybe they'll be able
to find us.

36:35.151 --> 36:38.947
We have to use your phone
'cause mine is murdered.

36:38.947 --> 36:40.490
- Mine's in the van, so.

36:42.826 --> 36:44.494
- What the fuck did you just
say?

36:46.496 --> 36:47.330
- I said mine was in the van

36:47.330 --> 36:48.206
in the cup holder.

36:50.333 --> 36:51.292
- What do you mean your phone

36:51.292 --> 36:52.502
is in the van in the cup holder?

36:52.502 --> 36:53.336
I don't get it.

36:56.548 --> 36:59.300
Your phone is in the van

36:59.300 --> 37:00.844
in the cup holder.

37:00.844 --> 37:05.014
Why the fuck is your
phone in the van, Alex?

37:07.600 --> 37:11.020
Who gets out of a car
without their phone, Alex?

37:11.020 --> 37:12.439
- I'm sure a lot of people do,
Stephanie.

37:12.439 --> 37:14.315
- No, nobody does that.

37:14.315 --> 37:15.650
We were just fucking there.

37:15.650 --> 37:16.526
Why didn't we get it.

37:16.526 --> 37:17.736
- I was fighting for my life,
Stephanie.

37:17.736 --> 37:19.070
I didn't, I don't know what to
tell you.

37:19.070 --> 37:21.364
- You were fighting for your
life?

37:21.364 --> 37:23.741
You were fighting for your life?

37:23.741 --> 37:25.410
Oh, okay.

37:25.410 --> 37:27.912
You are such a fucking idiot!

37:35.378 --> 37:38.256
- Can you please refrain
from attacking people

37:38.256 --> 37:40.049
who are on your side for one
second?

37:41.009 --> 37:44.012
Bryan's last memory is
of you giving him shit

37:44.012 --> 37:45.763
for fucking up a vacation
that you weren't even

37:45.763 --> 37:47.849
supposed to fucking be on at
all.

37:56.232 --> 37:57.066
He did not deserve that,

37:57.066 --> 37:58.485
and you did not deserve him.

38:00.487 --> 38:01.321
- Feel better?

38:01.321 --> 38:02.781
All done?

38:02.781 --> 38:04.616
- Can I get a factory
reset on my Stephanie

38:04.616 --> 38:06.367
'cause this one is stuck in cunt
mode.

38:06.367 --> 38:07.327
- That's really funny.

38:07.327 --> 38:09.245
It be funnier if that was a real
phone.

38:09.245 --> 38:11.289
But it's not, want to know how I
know?

38:11.289 --> 38:13.208
'Cause your phone's in the
fucking van.

38:13.208 --> 38:14.542
- Well, your phone is destroyed.

38:14.542 --> 38:15.835
- My phone is destroyed?

38:15.835 --> 38:16.669
You think that's the same thing-

38:16.669 --> 38:17.670
- Why are you being so mean to
me?

38:17.670 --> 38:19.589
It's not my fault
- Really, Alex?

38:20.548 --> 38:21.633
Really?

38:21.633 --> 38:23.885
I think I deserve a break
because my gash

38:23.885 --> 38:25.178
is literally still bleeding.

38:25.178 --> 38:27.514
- That explains the drive here
then.

38:27.514 --> 38:30.183
That's so funny.

38:50.703 --> 38:54.415
You could keep up and no one
else could.

38:56.167 --> 39:00.755
And honestly, I've never seen
Bryan so happy with anybody.

39:03.591 --> 39:05.552
I thought you guys were great
together.

39:13.726 --> 39:15.812
- I really don't know what
I'm gonna do without him.

39:17.146 --> 39:18.648
- You could still talk to him.

39:23.069 --> 39:24.571
- You mean like you and David?

39:28.950 --> 39:30.118
- No.

39:30.118 --> 39:32.203
We gonna talk about
that?

39:32.203 --> 39:34.330
- Bryan was a good person.

39:36.791 --> 39:39.586
And he was my only friend
on the fucking planet.

39:39.586 --> 39:43.715
I just, I guess I felt
like he was slipping away

39:43.715 --> 39:45.842
and I shouldn't have
taken that out on you.

39:50.763 --> 39:51.973
Happy?

39:57.770 --> 39:59.147
- Is that an apology?

40:00.648 --> 40:01.482
- Fuck you.

40:01.482 --> 40:05.278
I was just keeping it 100.

40:08.072 --> 40:12.201
- I don't even know who you are
anymore.

40:12.201 --> 40:13.036
- Me neither.

40:19.417 --> 40:20.251
- You didn't just say all that

40:20.251 --> 40:22.170
to avoid talking about David,
did you?

40:24.088 --> 40:25.673
- What?

40:27.425 --> 40:29.260
I would never do that.

40:30.511 --> 40:31.346
- You just did.

40:35.433 --> 40:37.685
Just so you know, you never
would have lost Bryan.

40:39.020 --> 40:41.481
You couldn't have 'cause he
felt the same way about you.

40:45.234 --> 40:46.069
- Thanks.

40:50.490 --> 40:51.324
Hey.

40:53.826 --> 40:57.580
Do you think Bryan still
has his phone on him?

40:57.580 --> 40:58.414
- No.

41:00.833 --> 41:02.960
No, I can't see his body again.

41:05.755 --> 41:07.256
- Then you don't have to look.

41:09.008 --> 41:10.677
But we need his phone.

41:41.582 --> 41:43.710
Do you see that?

41:43.710 --> 41:45.002
- What, is he here?

41:45.002 --> 41:46.004
- No, there.

41:49.966 --> 41:51.300
It's the police.

41:52.343 --> 41:55.012
- They came?

41:55.012 --> 41:55.847
- Hey.

41:57.015 --> 41:58.766
Hey, we're over here.

42:00.101 --> 42:00.935
Hey!

42:02.228 --> 42:03.062
Hey, stop!

42:04.355 --> 42:05.189
Stop!

42:05.189 --> 42:06.524
We're over here.

42:07.942 --> 42:09.777
Stop, we're over here.

42:09.777 --> 42:11.487
- Don't stop Stephanie.

42:11.487 --> 42:13.030
- Stop.

42:13.030 --> 42:14.031
Please stop.

42:16.242 --> 42:17.869
Hey!

42:17.869 --> 42:18.703
Stop!

42:52.069 --> 42:54.155
Of course he did.

42:54.155 --> 42:54.989
Alex.

42:56.407 --> 42:57.241
Run.

43:03.080 --> 43:04.165
Oh, fuck you.

43:18.429 --> 43:19.263
- Hey!

43:20.139 --> 43:21.808
Come back.

43:21.808 --> 43:23.142
She is wounded, you fuck.

43:23.142 --> 43:24.977
Come after me instead.

43:26.646 --> 43:28.189
- Every time you're about to
die,

43:28.189 --> 43:29.023
you think about me.

43:29.023 --> 43:30.858
I gotta say, I'm really
flattered.

43:30.858 --> 43:31.859
- Not the fucking time.

43:31.859 --> 43:34.362
- Oh, it's never a good
time with you is it?

43:34.362 --> 43:35.196
- Hey.

43:48.960 --> 43:50.461
Come at me, bitch!

43:51.546 --> 43:52.713
Why don't you step out of there

43:52.713 --> 43:54.841
and fight me like a woman?

43:54.841 --> 43:55.675
Huh?

44:00.638 --> 44:02.348
Run, Stephanie!

44:02.348 --> 44:05.309
- If you're gonna do it, just do
it.

44:06.352 --> 44:08.145
- Run, Stephanie!

44:08.145 --> 44:09.063
I'm coming!

44:10.565 --> 44:13.818
No!

44:15.403 --> 44:16.320
I'm coming.

44:18.489 --> 44:19.323
Go away.

44:21.951 --> 44:24.036
What do you want with us?

44:25.663 --> 44:28.040
I'm coming, Stephanie, I
promise.

44:42.889 --> 44:44.265
- Hey.

44:44.265 --> 44:45.683
Not to sound totally ungrateful,

44:45.683 --> 44:47.894
but why don't you kill me, huh?

44:48.936 --> 44:50.771
Isn't that, like, your thing.

44:51.898 --> 44:53.900
You are
not like the others.

44:53.900 --> 44:56.861
- Holy fuck, it talks.

44:56.861 --> 45:00.114
And it sounds like a
gurgling, cum-filled asshole.

45:00.114 --> 45:03.492
- You're brave, strong, you have
value.

45:03.492 --> 45:05.244
God, didn't
you hear what I said

45:05.244 --> 45:06.871
about validation earlier?

45:06.871 --> 45:07.705
I don't fucking need it

45:07.705 --> 45:11.167
and it definitely doesn't work
coming from that 1998 dial up

45:11.167 --> 45:13.169
sound effect you call a fucking
voice.

45:13.169 --> 45:15.212
- You will be welcomed by all.

45:18.132 --> 45:19.216
- There's more of you?

45:21.552 --> 45:22.386
Like how many?

45:24.263 --> 45:25.097
What do you got?

45:25.097 --> 45:28.517
Like a family of head
loppers out here, huh?

45:28.517 --> 45:29.352
Huh?

45:31.187 --> 45:33.064
Father and a mother and baby or
what?

45:33.981 --> 45:35.107
Instead of teaching the kid to
read,

45:35.107 --> 45:36.651
you just teach them to
cut the heads off lizards?

45:36.651 --> 45:38.235
What the fuck?

45:38.235 --> 45:40.196
You know what? I changed my
mind.

45:40.196 --> 45:41.530
I think you should kill me.

45:42.698 --> 45:44.325
Matter of fact, I'll kill
myself.

45:45.242 --> 45:49.121
- You will be convinced
and I will be rewarded.

45:50.790 --> 45:53.334
- You don't look vaccinated,

45:53.334 --> 45:56.045
so you'll definitely
catch some shit from me.

45:56.045 --> 45:57.922
Your whole little clan of cos
players

45:57.922 --> 46:00.549
will just drop dead as soon
as I walk through the door.

46:01.759 --> 46:04.011
- I will bring you to the
leaders.

46:04.011 --> 46:05.221
They will decide.

46:05.221 --> 46:07.139
- If we can get there before I
die.

46:07.139 --> 46:08.057
Huh?

46:08.057 --> 46:09.392
Remember when you cut me?

46:09.392 --> 46:11.477
Probably got fuckin' tetanus or
something.

46:12.853 --> 46:14.313
That shit hole of a trailer you
live in

46:14.313 --> 46:16.065
certainly wasn't fucking
sanitary.

46:17.149 --> 46:18.651
- There is an out post.

46:18.651 --> 46:20.653
I won't be there much longer.

46:20.653 --> 46:23.030
There's a better place waiting
for me.

46:23.030 --> 46:26.075
You will be tended to
what the leaders see fit.

46:26.075 --> 46:26.909
- Yeah.

46:29.161 --> 46:30.830
I don't really see that
happening.

46:42.049 --> 46:44.427
I'll rip your fucking
head off with my feet.

46:44.427 --> 46:47.304
I don't even need a toy
sword from a nerd convention.

46:47.304 --> 46:49.640
How you like that, bitch!

46:49.640 --> 46:50.474
- Let me go.

46:52.351 --> 46:53.185
- No.

46:53.185 --> 46:55.187
- Your feet stink.

46:55.187 --> 46:56.022
- No.

46:56.022 --> 46:58.357
Do not get away from me, no, no,
no.

46:58.357 --> 46:59.734
You motherfucker.

48:31.367 --> 48:33.160
- Why do you run away?

48:34.203 --> 48:35.955
I am attempting to spare your
life.

48:37.581 --> 48:39.166
- You're holding a sword.

48:40.334 --> 48:41.377
- You are ungrateful.

48:42.628 --> 48:44.839
- What are you gonna do about it
fucker?

48:44.839 --> 48:45.673
Kill me?

48:48.425 --> 48:49.260
- Drop it.

48:53.973 --> 48:54.974
- Damn it.

48:54.974 --> 48:56.225
You fucking asshole.

48:56.225 --> 48:58.477
I will report on your secret
society.

48:58.477 --> 48:59.645
Put me down!

48:59.645 --> 49:00.646
Put me down!

49:04.650 --> 49:06.318
You fucking asshole!

49:07.570 --> 49:10.990
Fuck you!

49:45.274 --> 49:46.275
- Stephanie.

49:49.862 --> 49:50.696
Bryan.

49:53.741 --> 49:54.992
No, no, no, no.

50:25.940 --> 50:28.442
I'm coming for you, Stephanie.

50:51.340 --> 50:52.758
- Don't touch me.

50:58.764 --> 50:59.598
No!

51:02.685 --> 51:04.436
- Don't embarrass me.

51:25.124 --> 51:26.500
- This is your society?

51:28.002 --> 51:29.378
These are your leaders?

51:30.462 --> 51:34.842
A bunch of fucking douche
lords in cloaks in the desert?

51:36.093 --> 51:37.219
You must all be men, right?

51:37.219 --> 51:39.346
'Cause no woman would agree to
this shit.

51:51.358 --> 51:52.192
- Dad!

51:54.695 --> 51:55.529
Dad!

51:59.366 --> 52:01.410
Dad, you forgot your scepter.

52:03.787 --> 52:04.997
You forgot your scepter.

52:07.875 --> 52:08.709
Hello, female.

52:10.836 --> 52:11.754
- Fall in line.

52:21.221 --> 52:22.598
What is the meaning of this?

52:23.807 --> 52:25.142
- A gift.

52:25.142 --> 52:29.188
Dear leaders, through your
wisdom comes safety and glory.

52:29.188 --> 52:30.397
Safety and glory.

52:31.231 --> 52:34.902
- Why do you defy the will
of the order, executioner?

52:34.902 --> 52:36.737
You have abandoned your outpost.

52:37.654 --> 52:38.781
Safety and glory-

52:38.781 --> 52:39.615
Safety and glory.

52:39.615 --> 52:43.243
- Are only possible so long
as everyone does his part.

52:44.078 --> 52:46.538
Your part is guarding the
outpost

52:46.538 --> 52:48.457
to keep us safe from intruders.

52:48.457 --> 52:50.709
- I plan on killing her.

52:50.709 --> 52:54.546
I thought she could
provide a valuable asset.

52:56.006 --> 52:57.883
- That is not your decision to
make.

52:59.259 --> 53:02.262
- That is why I brought
her to you, master.

53:02.262 --> 53:04.264
- Yeah, you know what, you're
right.

53:04.264 --> 53:06.683
He broke the rules.

53:07.684 --> 53:10.479
So you should definitely kill
him

53:10.479 --> 53:12.815
and then I'll just, you know,

53:12.815 --> 53:14.566
get out of your hair.

53:14.566 --> 53:15.776
- Hm.

53:15.776 --> 53:17.027
She's feisty.

53:17.986 --> 53:19.905
I got an idea of what to do with
her.

53:19.905 --> 53:21.281
- Yeah, I got an idea too,
asshole,

53:21.281 --> 53:24.118
how 'bout you eat shit and
fucking die?

53:29.498 --> 53:31.208
- Make your case, executioner.

53:33.085 --> 53:34.837
- We are as the lake was!

53:40.092 --> 53:42.803
- We're gonna need a bit more
than that.

53:42.803 --> 53:44.721
- The lake was great.

53:44.721 --> 53:46.473
Now it is gone.

53:46.473 --> 53:48.100
And the order is great.

53:48.100 --> 53:49.935
It provides us safety and glory.

53:49.935 --> 53:50.853
Safety and glory.

53:50.853 --> 53:52.771
- Recruitment is dwindling.

53:52.771 --> 53:53.647
We are aging.

53:54.565 --> 53:55.941
The order will be gone.

53:56.859 --> 53:58.652
If brought back to health,

53:58.652 --> 54:01.488
the girl could provide us
with powerful offspring,

54:01.488 --> 54:04.158
to strengthen our numbers and
bring us

54:04.158 --> 54:05.242
to the next stage.

54:05.242 --> 54:06.910
- Try me, asshole.

54:06.910 --> 54:08.787
I will cut off all your dicks.

54:10.789 --> 54:14.001
- It has been a long time
since I've had a mocha latte.

54:15.669 --> 54:17.754
- If I have to sit around
long enough for one of you

54:17.754 --> 54:20.299
limp dicks to get hard
enough to impregnate me,

54:20.299 --> 54:23.010
I'll die of fucking boredom.

54:23.010 --> 54:24.678
- Then we can fuck your corpse.

54:27.473 --> 54:29.641
- We do not fuck the dead.

54:29.641 --> 54:30.809
We're not animals.

54:32.769 --> 54:34.563
- Although, you know I hate to
admit it,

54:34.563 --> 54:39.318
I believe our friend from the
outpost-

54:39.318 --> 54:41.653
- Are you talking about me?
- Has a rather good point.

54:41.653 --> 54:43.864
- Are you talking about me?
- We haven't seen

54:43.864 --> 54:47.242
a new recruit in quite some
time.

54:47.242 --> 54:48.994
- I think it might be a little
dangerous,

54:48.994 --> 54:51.580
you know, bringing another
female to the group.

54:51.580 --> 54:53.832
Even when under our command.

54:53.832 --> 54:56.084
- You're referring to
another woman, are you..

54:56.084 --> 54:58.295
- Yeah, I'm referring to you.

54:58.295 --> 55:00.130
- Ew, I'm not a girl.

55:00.130 --> 55:03.050
Yes, you are.

55:03.050 --> 55:04.176
You have to be.

55:04.176 --> 55:05.677
- No, I'm not.

55:05.677 --> 55:09.139
Felicity Fellatio Bones
is a character that I play

55:09.139 --> 55:10.641
that happens to be female.

55:10.641 --> 55:13.060
And like every female, she's a
hoe.

55:13.060 --> 55:14.645
And like every male, you love
it.

55:14.645 --> 55:18.148
Oh, shit.

55:18.148 --> 55:20.484
You guys are both fucking the
drag queen.

55:20.484 --> 55:21.985
- She's a woman!

55:21.985 --> 55:22.819
Okay.
- I thought you were

55:22.819 --> 55:23.779
a transgender.

55:24.947 --> 55:27.199
- I am a man, honey.

55:27.199 --> 55:29.910
- I do not care if you're a man,
Felicity.

55:29.910 --> 55:32.162
And you haven't earned
this pussy yet, baby.

55:32.162 --> 55:34.289
- This is needlessly confusing.

55:34.289 --> 55:37.167
Conversations like this are why
I left LA.

55:37.167 --> 55:38.418
- It's not that confusing.

55:38.418 --> 55:39.753
You're just a little slow.

55:40.671 --> 55:43.840
- So you guys are all
fucking the same dude

55:43.840 --> 55:46.051
but you don't get to fuck
anyone.

55:46.051 --> 55:50.097
Hey, you know these guys hate
you, right?

55:50.097 --> 55:51.807
- Okay, all right, my point
still stands.

55:51.807 --> 55:54.142
We would bring her in out of
kindness.

55:54.142 --> 55:55.352
- Yeah but she's a woman,

55:55.352 --> 55:58.063
and women always want
more, they want more power.

55:58.063 --> 55:59.439
- Sex with other men.

55:59.439 --> 56:01.567
- Oh, sounds like some boss ass
bitch

56:01.567 --> 56:03.610
really did a number on you
nerds.

56:03.610 --> 56:04.820
Carly.

56:04.820 --> 56:05.654
Carly.

56:05.654 --> 56:06.989
- Fuck you, Jared.

56:06.989 --> 56:07.906
- Fuck you, dude.

56:07.906 --> 56:08.991
Don't use my old name.

56:08.991 --> 56:11.618
We don't talk about
the before time, Larry!

56:11.618 --> 56:14.329
- Oh, you mean when you used to
be gay?

56:14.329 --> 56:17.583
- Whatever, you're just
mad cause' you're gay

56:17.583 --> 56:19.293
and I got electrocuted straight.

56:19.293 --> 56:20.127
Right, Dad?

56:20.127 --> 56:20.961
- Stop calling me that.

56:20.961 --> 56:21.837
- Prove it.

56:21.837 --> 56:22.879
- Oh, I'll prove it.

56:22.879 --> 56:23.797
I'm gonna prove it so hard,

56:23.797 --> 56:24.631
you're gonna be like,

56:24.631 --> 56:26.550
oh give it to me, give it to me,
Jared.

56:26.550 --> 56:28.343
I'm gonna give it to you.

56:28.343 --> 56:30.804
- What the fuck does that mean?

56:32.014 --> 56:33.265
- Safety and glory.

56:34.182 --> 56:35.017
- Get over here.

56:35.892 --> 56:36.727
Right here.

56:40.439 --> 56:42.065
Look at this woman

56:42.065 --> 56:43.734
and tell me what you think of
her.

56:47.112 --> 56:48.614
- Sexy.

56:50.782 --> 56:53.201
- Do you think we should take
her in?

56:53.201 --> 56:55.037
We could make children.

56:55.037 --> 56:56.413
We could start a town.

56:56.413 --> 56:57.873
A city, even.

56:57.873 --> 56:59.041
- Okay.

56:59.041 --> 57:00.792
It's a tough question

57:00.792 --> 57:01.877
'cause she's obviously hot,

57:01.877 --> 57:04.296
but she's probably just a
lesbian feminist

57:04.296 --> 57:05.505
and her kids would suck.

57:05.505 --> 57:06.798
I say we kill her.

57:08.550 --> 57:12.137
- Oh, oh, so you're making
decisions

57:12.137 --> 57:14.681
without conferring with
the council, now, Jared?

57:14.681 --> 57:15.641
- Wow.

57:15.641 --> 57:18.060
So now you're making
decisions without conferring

57:18.060 --> 57:19.645
with the Council, huh, Jared?

57:19.645 --> 57:21.063
- Did you find any actual value

57:21.063 --> 57:23.482
in just repeating that
entire sentence verbatim?

57:29.196 --> 57:31.031
I have made my decision.

57:31.031 --> 57:32.616
First we're gonna make sure

57:32.616 --> 57:34.618
that cut doesn't get infected,

57:34.618 --> 57:37.245
then we take turns fucking her

57:37.245 --> 57:38.789
until she gives us a child.

57:38.789 --> 57:40.082
- I'll go first.

57:40.082 --> 57:40.916
Then you, Jared.

57:41.958 --> 57:42.793
- Awesome.

57:44.294 --> 57:45.128
- I did good?

57:46.880 --> 57:48.298
- Safety and glory, brother.

57:48.298 --> 57:50.258
- Safety, safety and glory.

57:58.016 --> 58:00.310
- You can have one turn with
her,

58:00.310 --> 58:01.853
and get back to your outpost.

58:19.705 --> 58:20.539
- Oh god.

58:21.373 --> 58:23.250
- Come down, you big baby.

58:23.250 --> 58:24.710
They're letting you live.

58:24.710 --> 58:25.961
- We just want strong children.

58:25.961 --> 58:27.629
We don't even find her
attractive.

58:28.547 --> 58:30.048
- Oh, hi, Larry.

58:30.048 --> 58:31.550
Why don't you make yourself
useful

58:31.550 --> 58:32.801
and go get us some water?

58:33.719 --> 58:35.011
- It's over a mile to the well,

58:35.011 --> 58:36.138
get it yourself.

58:38.056 --> 58:39.933
- Did you want me to suck you
off tonight?

58:41.143 --> 58:42.394
I said-

58:42.394 --> 58:44.563
- Yeah, I want you to suck me
off tonight.

58:44.563 --> 58:47.149
- So go fucking get some water.

58:47.149 --> 58:48.692
Use the new van if you have to.

58:52.237 --> 58:54.614
- Hey, what the fuck are
you doing with these guys?

58:54.614 --> 58:58.034
- Baby, even lonely idiots
needs some loving too.

58:58.034 --> 59:00.787
You try denying three
pussy-whipped boys

59:00.787 --> 59:03.457
who will do whatever you want
with them.

59:03.457 --> 59:04.458
I haven't gotten so much
free dick in my life

59:04.458 --> 59:06.543
and some of them actually
kind know what they're doing.

59:06.543 --> 59:07.669
- No, fuck that.

59:07.669 --> 59:09.588
They murdered my best friend.

59:09.588 --> 59:11.715
- Never said they were perfect.

59:11.715 --> 59:13.383
- So you're like their queen?

59:13.383 --> 59:14.843
- Bow down, bitch.

59:14.843 --> 59:17.471
- Seems like they want
to crown a new queen now.

59:17.471 --> 59:19.097
Why would
they want to do that?

59:19.097 --> 59:21.433
- Because now they have a real
woman.

59:21.433 --> 59:23.560
Someone who can actually
give them children.

59:23.560 --> 59:24.895
How many of them do you think

59:24.895 --> 59:25.729
are still gonna want you

59:25.729 --> 59:27.230
when they've had a taste of me?

59:28.315 --> 59:29.858
- Probably just Jared.

59:29.858 --> 59:30.984
He always makes me top.

59:32.235 --> 59:33.737
- Cut me loose.

59:33.737 --> 59:36.281
Then you'll never have
to think about me again.

59:36.281 --> 59:38.825
- Or I could just kill you right
now.

59:40.452 --> 59:42.037
- They'll never forgive you.

59:42.037 --> 59:44.372
If you let me go, they'll
think that I escaped.

59:47.167 --> 59:49.544
- Girl, you are fucked up.

59:51.630 --> 59:53.048
I like that about you.

59:55.133 --> 59:56.551
- Leave us.

59:56.551 --> 59:57.552
- She's not done yet,

59:57.552 --> 59:59.137
'cause I-
- I won't be long.

1:00:00.472 --> 1:00:01.848
- He's not lying about that.

1:00:01.848 --> 1:00:02.808
- I said leave us.

1:00:02.808 --> 1:00:03.767
- Okay.
- Felicity.

1:00:03.767 --> 1:00:05.227
- Don't grab, girl.
- Felicity!

1:00:05.227 --> 1:00:06.895
Right now, don't
worry.

1:00:06.895 --> 1:00:08.313
Bye, girl, sorry!

1:00:10.524 --> 1:00:11.733
- It's been a long, long time

1:00:11.733 --> 1:00:13.902
since I've tasted actual pussy.

1:00:16.488 --> 1:00:18.824
Let's find out if it's
as good as I remember.

1:00:18.824 --> 1:00:20.450
- It's not, it's really not.

1:00:20.450 --> 1:00:21.493
My boyfriend cheated on me.

1:00:21.493 --> 1:00:22.327
I got the clap.

1:00:22.327 --> 1:00:23.161
You'll get the-

1:00:23.161 --> 1:00:26.122
- Stop talking!

1:00:27.874 --> 1:00:29.334
I don't believe you!

1:00:32.796 --> 1:00:34.047
If you kick me,

1:00:35.257 --> 1:00:39.344
you will suffer more pain
than you could imagine.

1:00:46.142 --> 1:00:46.977
- Wait.

1:00:48.728 --> 1:00:53.191
Let me at least get you hard
first.

1:00:54.818 --> 1:00:56.570
- Have you had a change of
heart?

1:00:58.029 --> 1:01:01.157
- It'll go faster, if you're
hard.

1:01:06.580 --> 1:01:08.874
Wow, what a great cock.

1:01:12.502 --> 1:01:13.962
I'm really gonna enjoy this.

1:02:33.792 --> 1:02:34.793
- Girl, run!

1:02:34.793 --> 1:02:35.627
Before somebody finds you

1:02:35.627 --> 1:02:37.253
and I gotta kill you myself.

1:02:37.253 --> 1:02:39.589
Go. Fuck out of here.

1:02:39.589 --> 1:02:40.423
Asshole.

1:03:31.433 --> 1:03:34.102
Fuck you, bitches.

1:04:07.844 --> 1:04:09.304
- Hey!

1:04:09.304 --> 1:04:11.765
It's me, it's me, it's me.

1:04:11.765 --> 1:04:13.183
You're okay.

1:04:13.183 --> 1:04:14.392
You're okay.

1:04:14.392 --> 1:04:15.477
Yeah.
- Alex?

1:04:18.980 --> 1:04:21.149
- I thought you were dead.

1:04:23.526 --> 1:04:27.238
- I thought he went back and
killed you.

1:04:27.238 --> 1:04:29.491
- I'm so glad you're alive.

1:04:30.700 --> 1:04:31.534
- Me too.

1:04:33.828 --> 1:04:34.662
- What did he do?

1:04:34.662 --> 1:04:35.997
Is he around here?

1:04:42.462 --> 1:04:43.296
- He's...

1:04:44.589 --> 1:04:46.633
He's knocked out.

1:04:47.634 --> 1:04:49.511
The the drag queen

1:04:49.511 --> 1:04:50.845
hit him with a rolling pin.

1:04:53.473 --> 1:04:55.266
- Are you hallucinating again?

1:05:10.532 --> 1:05:14.077
What the fuck is wrong with
straight men?

1:05:14.077 --> 1:05:15.286
- They are not straight.

1:05:19.415 --> 1:05:21.459
- We gotta get out of here.

1:05:21.459 --> 1:05:22.544
- I need a minute.

1:05:24.504 --> 1:05:26.214
I think we have at least a
minute.

1:05:37.934 --> 1:05:39.811
Maybe we can take some
of those fuckers out

1:05:39.811 --> 1:05:41.563
when they show up with the
cavalry.

1:05:42.438 --> 1:05:44.065
- What?

1:05:44.065 --> 1:05:46.526
You didn't tell me that they had
horses.

1:05:46.526 --> 1:05:47.777
- They don't.

1:05:47.777 --> 1:05:49.279
Where are you getting that?

1:05:49.279 --> 1:05:51.823
- Calvary, it's a French
military term for equest-

1:05:51.823 --> 1:05:54.284
- I thought cavalry was like
backup.

1:05:55.618 --> 1:05:57.871
- Well, yes and no on that.

1:05:59.956 --> 1:06:00.790
- Oh shit.

1:06:03.084 --> 1:06:04.627
I can't believe this is the last
thing

1:06:04.627 --> 1:06:05.962
you're ever gonna teach me.

1:06:08.590 --> 1:06:09.424
- Don't say that.

1:06:13.636 --> 1:06:15.930
Because rhino horns are made
from hair.

1:06:20.894 --> 1:06:22.896
- Can I ask you a question?

1:06:22.896 --> 1:06:24.189
But you have to be honest.

1:06:26.232 --> 1:06:29.319
Did you really like Bryan's
photography?

1:06:32.405 --> 1:06:37.035
- I liked how much he
liked this photography.

1:06:37.035 --> 1:06:37.952
I thought maybe

1:06:37.952 --> 1:06:39.245
he would get better at it,

1:06:39.245 --> 1:06:40.288
but he really just got better

1:06:40.288 --> 1:06:41.915
at the whole bullshitting thing.

1:06:43.166 --> 1:06:44.584
- You remember the moles,

1:06:44.584 --> 1:06:48.755
he always tried to cover
them up with the airbrush.

1:06:52.342 --> 1:06:54.928
He used to get so pissed

1:06:54.928 --> 1:06:56.554
when I'd give him shit for that.

1:06:58.181 --> 1:06:59.849
He took it so seriously, you
know?

1:06:59.849 --> 1:07:00.850
- I know.

1:07:07.607 --> 1:07:08.816
None of this feels real.

1:07:11.611 --> 1:07:13.821
- Those fucks are very, very
real.

1:07:18.534 --> 1:07:22.205
- Steph, we gotta get that van.

1:07:22.205 --> 1:07:23.164
Let's go.

1:07:23.164 --> 1:07:23.998
- No!

1:07:26.125 --> 1:07:26.960
- Steph, what do you mean no?

1:07:26.960 --> 1:07:28.378
- Let's just sit here.

1:07:29.879 --> 1:07:31.172
What's the fucking point?

1:07:32.382 --> 1:07:33.216
You know?

1:07:35.343 --> 1:07:37.387
Every boss I'll have, every
boyfriend,

1:07:37.387 --> 1:07:40.932
every manager, every fucking
president,

1:07:42.141 --> 1:07:45.228
I'm gonna see one of
those cape-wearing fucks

1:07:45.228 --> 1:07:47.730
who killed my best friend,

1:07:47.730 --> 1:07:49.274
and would rather hold me hostage

1:07:49.274 --> 1:07:53.695
as a fucking baby factory
than let me just live.

1:07:57.907 --> 1:07:58.992
Live my life.

1:08:02.328 --> 1:08:03.454
How are we gonna go back

1:08:03.454 --> 1:08:05.206
to having a normal life after
this?

1:08:08.876 --> 1:08:11.087
Even if I do take enough Xanax

1:08:11.087 --> 1:08:14.966
to feel fucking normal once
in a while, I'll hate myself.

1:08:18.970 --> 1:08:22.348
The life I had is over.

1:08:27.353 --> 1:08:29.272
- Your shitty boyfriend cheated
on you

1:08:30.648 --> 1:08:32.859
and then worked out
outside of your apartment

1:08:32.859 --> 1:08:33.901
just to piss you off.

1:08:35.194 --> 1:08:37.363
You got your chest cut open.

1:08:37.363 --> 1:08:41.492
You put a nasty desert dude's
dick inside your mouth.

1:08:43.077 --> 1:08:44.287
So you can't forget.

1:08:48.124 --> 1:08:49.167
You don't forget.

1:08:53.046 --> 1:08:53.880
- Yeah.

1:08:56.382 --> 1:08:57.717
, fuck.

1:09:00.928 --> 1:09:03.139
It's worse than I remembered.

1:09:03.139 --> 1:09:04.640
Okay.

1:09:04.640 --> 1:09:05.475
- Sorry.

1:09:08.978 --> 1:09:10.104
Just wait with me.

1:09:17.862 --> 1:09:20.198
- Do you have any more weed?

1:09:39.300 --> 1:09:41.135
- I love that you still have
hope.

1:09:45.807 --> 1:09:46.849
- Love is a big word.

1:09:48.476 --> 1:09:50.478
You can't just go throwing
that around willy nilly.

1:09:55.942 --> 1:09:57.068
- Holly shit, they're here.

1:09:57.068 --> 1:09:58.444
- Hide.

1:10:08.830 --> 1:10:11.499
- Stephanie?
- Just don't fucking move.

1:10:11.499 --> 1:10:12.875
Okay, stay there.

1:10:19.382 --> 1:10:20.216
- What are you doing?

1:10:20.216 --> 1:10:21.426
- I said don't fucking move

1:10:21.426 --> 1:10:22.635
or I'll kill you myself.

1:10:56.794 --> 1:10:57.712
- Ready to talk?

1:10:57.712 --> 1:10:58.796
- Jesus.

1:10:58.796 --> 1:11:00.173
Fuck!

1:11:00.173 --> 1:11:02.049
You know what? Yeah, I am.

1:11:02.049 --> 1:11:02.884
- Good.

1:11:02.884 --> 1:11:04.051
I'll go first-

1:11:04.051 --> 1:11:05.720
- I'm not mad at you anymore.

1:11:05.720 --> 1:11:06.637
Not personally.

1:11:07.472 --> 1:11:09.807
I just hate what you represent.

1:11:09.807 --> 1:11:11.684
- You're saying I'm just
like everybody else.

1:11:11.684 --> 1:11:13.352
I think you better-
- I forgive you.

1:11:13.352 --> 1:11:14.437
Okay?

1:11:14.437 --> 1:11:17.190
I give you permission to leave
my life.

1:11:18.900 --> 1:11:20.401
I said boy, bye.

1:11:32.455 --> 1:11:34.165
Oh, hey.

1:11:34.165 --> 1:11:35.041
Want to fight?

1:11:38.085 --> 1:11:39.962
Hey, I didn't get your name.

1:11:39.962 --> 1:11:42.131
- We would have given
you a life of luxury.

1:11:43.508 --> 1:11:45.510
All you had to do was provide
children,

1:11:46.886 --> 1:11:49.847
and the order would have
showered you with gifts.

1:11:49.847 --> 1:11:51.224
- But fuck the order.

1:12:34.642 --> 1:12:36.102
- Oh, shit.

1:12:36.102 --> 1:12:36.978
Sorry, honey.

1:12:38.437 --> 1:12:40.648
You killed my boyfriend.

1:12:40.648 --> 1:12:42.108
You killed our mutual friend.

1:12:43.568 --> 1:12:45.778
I don't care how many
of the fucks you are.

1:12:45.778 --> 1:12:47.697
I'm gonna take you out.

1:12:47.697 --> 1:12:49.949
- You don't stand a
chance against the order.

1:12:50.825 --> 1:12:53.619
Why do you fight when you could
join us?

1:12:53.619 --> 1:12:56.038
- I would rather die than
join you rapist fucks.

1:12:56.038 --> 1:12:58.249
- Your loyalty is misguided.

1:13:08.593 --> 1:13:09.594
- You wanna kiss me?

1:13:17.810 --> 1:13:19.312
- Come back here, pussy.

1:13:20.396 --> 1:13:21.981
- You're the pussy!

1:13:25.610 --> 1:13:26.944
You sick fucks.

1:13:28.362 --> 1:13:31.407
- You will be even easier
to kill than the girl.

1:13:31.407 --> 1:13:33.534
- Her name was Stephanie!

1:13:44.086 --> 1:13:46.923
You are loving this, aren't you?

1:13:46.923 --> 1:13:48.966
Is this the only head you're
gonna get?

1:13:48.966 --> 1:13:51.010
What, are you one of those skull
fuckers.

1:13:52.094 --> 1:13:55.056
- And what if I fuck the
skull of your boyfriend

1:13:55.056 --> 1:13:57.350
after it was removed from his
body?

1:14:00.269 --> 1:14:02.021
Would that be objectionable to
you?

1:14:04.649 --> 1:14:06.067
- Yes, it is.

1:14:27.213 --> 1:14:28.881
Should I kill you now?

1:14:28.881 --> 1:14:31.676
Yeah, yeah, I think I should.

1:14:51.946 --> 1:14:53.990
Heard you like skull fucking,
huh?

1:15:09.547 --> 1:15:12.216
Don't like it too much now, huh?

1:15:40.453 --> 1:15:42.037
Oh, yeah.

1:15:42.037 --> 1:15:42.872
It's hot.

1:15:50.629 --> 1:15:51.839
I'm so sorry, Stephanie.

1:15:55.468 --> 1:15:57.136
I'm so sorry, Bryan.

1:15:58.763 --> 1:16:00.014
I'm going home.

1:16:42.056 --> 1:16:44.099
You sure you
don't want me to drive?

1:16:54.068 --> 1:16:55.820
- I don't know where I'm going,
so.

1:16:56.862 --> 1:16:57.780
That's your cue.

1:16:57.780 --> 1:16:59.824
- Well, I don't know how to work
a map.

1:17:00.991 --> 1:17:02.576
I could just use my phone.

1:17:08.582 --> 1:17:09.667
- I love you.

1:17:12.670 --> 1:17:14.463
- Well I'm kind of easy to love.

1:17:17.091 --> 1:17:18.759
- You make blood look really
good.

1:17:26.225 --> 1:17:27.268
You're gonna be okay.

1:17:49.123 --> 1:17:49.957
- Fuck.

1:17:50.958 --> 1:17:53.502
Fuck, I fucking murdered
someone!

1:18:01.010 --> 1:18:02.970
Are you fucking kidding me?

1:18:07.349 --> 1:18:09.768
If I die, we both die, bitch!

1:20:21.608 --> 1:20:26.613
we have moved too slow

1:22:36.326 --> 1:22:41.290
we have moved too slow
