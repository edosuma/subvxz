CAN WE MEET UP? MINOR?
I'll PAY 200,000 WON FOR 3 HRS, YES?

01:19.704 --> 01:21.081
-Excuse me.
-My gosh…

01:21.164 --> 01:23.792
I'm really sorry,
but can I borrow your phone?

01:23.875 --> 01:25.043
I'm sorry.

01:27.170 --> 01:29.923
Hi, I've lost my phone and--

01:30.006 --> 01:31.591
Sorry, my phone is dead…

01:55.281 --> 01:57.575
I'll be there soon. Yes.

01:58.743 --> 01:59.953
Just a second, hold up.

02:01.579 --> 02:02.580
Hey, kid.

02:03.581 --> 02:05.125
Hold up.

02:10.964 --> 02:12.298
What is this?

02:14.050 --> 02:15.218
Wait, is this blood?

02:16.344 --> 02:17.971
No, it isn't…

02:18.054 --> 02:19.347
It definitely seems like it.

02:19.430 --> 02:22.392
What's your name?
What school do you go to?

02:22.475 --> 02:24.185
Let's talk inside the police station.

02:26.604 --> 02:28.231
Actually I should take you
to the hospital first.

02:28.314 --> 02:30.316
Hey, snap out of it. You should say
something so that I can help you.

02:30.400 --> 02:31.651
No, I…

02:32.777 --> 02:34.070
It's not that…

02:36.990 --> 02:39.742
<i>I got it! The roof of building 101!</i>

02:40.243 --> 02:41.494
<i>Send in the task force!</i>

02:41.578 --> 02:42.912
<i>We're on our way!</i>

02:56.134 --> 02:59.304
<i>I killed someone…</i>

03:03.474 --> 03:04.434
What?

03:08.438 --> 03:09.564
…with this.

03:21.284 --> 03:23.119
PETITION TO ABOLISH THE JUVENILE ACT
AND BRING MURDERERS TO JUSTICE

03:23.202 --> 03:25.079
RAISE THE LEGAL THRESHOLD
FOR PUNISHMENT OF JUVENILE OFFENDERS

03:25.163 --> 03:29.167
The assailant who murdered
and mutilated an eight-year-old

03:29.250 --> 03:33.296
<i>has turned himself in
eight hours after committing the crime.</i>

03:34.088 --> 03:36.758
<i>The culprit, Baek, turned out
to be a 13-year-old</i>

03:36.841 --> 03:40.011
<i>who lived in the same apartment complex
as the victim.</i>

03:40.094 --> 03:43.598
<i>Baek has already
been investigated by the police.</i>

03:43.681 --> 03:46.226
<i>However, being under 14 years of age,</i>

03:46.309 --> 03:49.270
<i>he is a young offender that is not subject
to the same laws as an adult.</i>

03:49.354 --> 03:51.439
<i>There is growing controversy
surrounding his punishment.</i>

03:51.522 --> 03:53.191
You're not even human, you asshole!

04:05.870 --> 04:08.957
<i>There are 3,300 judges in Korea,</i>

04:09.832 --> 04:12.794
<i>but only 20 of them work
at a juvenile court.</i>

04:12.877 --> 04:13.920
COURT

04:14.003 --> 04:19.467
Those 20 judges meet more than
30,000 young offenders every year.

04:20.426 --> 04:25.556
<i>There are no prosecutors
in juvenile court, only assistants.</i>

04:25.640 --> 04:28.351
<i>The judge questions
the young offenders themselves</i>

04:28.434 --> 04:30.561
<i>to decide the kind of probation
they will be put under.</i>

04:30.645 --> 04:33.564
And that's when their work really starts.

04:35.566 --> 04:39.237
They need to see if the young offender
is adjusting within their given probation.

04:40.196 --> 04:44.325
They need to make sure the young offender
doesn't run away or commit another crime.

04:45.368 --> 04:48.329
The judge in charge needs to
constantly manage and supervise them.

04:48.413 --> 04:49.831
That's strange.

04:49.914 --> 04:52.709
Why does the judge have to do that
after the trial is all over?

04:53.459 --> 04:55.503
The purpose of the Juvenile Act is

04:55.586 --> 04:59.090
to provide the proper environment
in which anti-social juveniles

04:59.590 --> 05:01.175
can correct their behavior.

05:02.135 --> 05:07.098
So it's also the judge's duty to manage
and supervise them.

05:07.181 --> 05:11.769
So the purpose of juvenile court
isn't to punish them?

05:13.062 --> 05:16.941
Okay, we'll wrap up the interview
after one final question.

05:17.442 --> 05:20.153
Why did you choose to be
a juvenile court judge?

05:27.827 --> 05:29.620
There's only one reason.

05:31.914 --> 05:33.041
Hatred.

05:34.250 --> 05:35.251
Pardon?

05:38.963 --> 05:39.922
I…

05:41.883 --> 05:45.928
detest young offenders.

06:09.494 --> 06:11.496
When will I be able
to get feedback on this?

06:12.747 --> 06:14.457
-Is this what you wanted?
-Yes.

06:14.540 --> 06:18.628
Being at a juvenile classification center
doesn't mean he'll have a criminal record.

06:18.711 --> 06:20.046
It's not a prison, ma'am.

06:20.630 --> 06:23.424
Most people think it's a detention center,

06:23.508 --> 06:25.134
but it also counts as school attendance

06:25.218 --> 06:28.346
and they investigate the case further
and provide therapy…

Hello, I'm Woo Su-mi. I'm a manager here.

07:10.763 --> 07:12.473
You're here earlier than expected.

07:12.557 --> 07:13.683
This way, please.

07:20.314 --> 07:23.734
You were informed that you'll be sharing
the room with another judge, right?

07:23.818 --> 07:26.779
He's a male judge
by the name of Cha Tae-ju.

07:28.781 --> 07:31.075
He spent all night
writing out his rulings.

07:31.159 --> 07:33.744
He just went to freshen up.

07:36.914 --> 07:37.999
What about Presiding Judge Kang?

07:39.542 --> 07:40.710
Is he inside?

07:41.711 --> 07:42.879
-Great work.
-Thank you.

07:42.962 --> 07:44.464
-Good job.
-Great work.

07:44.547 --> 07:45.673
Thanks.

07:45.756 --> 07:48.384
Next week's shoot
has been postponed a week, right?

07:48.468 --> 07:51.220
Yes. Today's footage should be enough
for the next two weeks.

07:51.304 --> 07:53.973
Gosh, one of the associate judges
quit out of the blue.

07:54.056 --> 07:56.392
We have cases coming in,
but not enough people.

07:56.476 --> 08:00.062
-It's driving me crazy.
-You're going on air, judging trials,

08:00.563 --> 08:01.856
and even volunteering.

08:02.690 --> 08:03.774
I respect you, Judge Kang.

08:03.858 --> 08:05.401
A LOOK AT JUDGE KANG WON-JUNG
WHO GIVES AND VOLUNTEERS

08:07.153 --> 08:09.447
Gosh. What a guy.

08:09.530 --> 08:10.531
Sir!

08:10.615 --> 08:13.826
The court called.
They need you right away.

08:15.578 --> 08:17.622
Abolish the Juvenile Act!

08:17.705 --> 08:19.707
-Abolish!
-Abolish!

08:19.790 --> 08:21.501
Abolish the Juvenile Act!

08:21.584 --> 08:23.294
-Abolish!
-Abolish!

08:23.377 --> 08:27.256
<i>Enforce harsher punishment
for young violent offenders!</i>

08:27.340 --> 08:28.299
<i>-Enforce!
-Enforce!</i>

08:28.382 --> 08:29.634
Yes, sir.

08:31.052 --> 08:32.053
Again?

08:33.221 --> 08:35.515
How bad is the injury?

08:36.891 --> 08:39.685
Yes, I understand.

08:39.769 --> 08:44.357
Yes, he should be treated first.
Let me know when it's over. Thank you.

08:44.941 --> 08:45.900
Okay.

08:45.983 --> 08:47.735
JUVENILE CRIMINAL COLLEGIATE DIVISION

08:50.488 --> 08:51.364
Excuse me.

08:52.657 --> 08:53.991
Who are you?

08:55.493 --> 08:57.787
Well, the thing is…

08:58.371 --> 09:00.998
This isn't a place where
people can just come and go.

09:01.582 --> 09:03.793
Who are you here to meet?

09:05.002 --> 09:08.422
-The new associate judge coming in today.
-Do you mean Judge Sim Eun-seok?

09:09.715 --> 09:10.841
Did you meet her?

09:11.884 --> 09:13.719
I heard she was running a little late

09:13.803 --> 09:15.888
because the transfer came out of the blue.

09:17.139 --> 09:19.141
Did you have an appointment with her?

09:19.225 --> 09:20.851
I don't need an appointment.

09:22.395 --> 09:23.437
I am…

09:25.273 --> 09:26.524
Sim Eun-seok.

09:28.776 --> 09:31.946
I'm your senior,
so I can talk casually, right?

09:39.078 --> 09:40.746
-Hey!
-My goodness.

09:40.830 --> 09:41.872
What's wrong with you?

09:41.956 --> 09:44.375
I told you not to call the TV station!

09:44.458 --> 09:48.296
Didn't I tell you you'll jinx everything
if you keep calling from the court?

09:49.046 --> 09:51.924
I'm walking on eggshells over there as is.

09:52.925 --> 09:56.053
Are you going to take responsibility
if I get fired?

09:56.554 --> 09:58.514
Presiding Judge Kang.
I told him to call you.

09:58.598 --> 10:00.057
We received an urgent case.

10:00.808 --> 10:01.684
What is it?

10:01.767 --> 10:04.687
The Yeonhwa Child Murder Case
has come to us.

10:04.770 --> 10:10.693
I'll tell the new associate judge
and Judge Tae-ju to gather in your room.

10:17.408 --> 10:18.534
JUVENILE PROTECTION CASE

10:29.045 --> 10:32.923
Sir, you have a meeting with the press
arbitration commission after this meeting.

10:33.007 --> 10:34.133
What would you like to do for lunch?

10:43.059 --> 10:46.354
You know about
the Yeonhwa Child Murder Case, right?

10:48.689 --> 10:50.107
YEONHWA DISTRICT COURT
JUVENILE PROTECTION CASE

10:50.191 --> 10:52.401
<i>Ji-hu!</i>

10:52.485 --> 10:55.071
Ji-hu!

10:59.283 --> 11:01.619
Ji-hu!

11:04.246 --> 11:07.416
Ji-hu borrowed a phone from some older kid

11:07.500 --> 11:10.044
because he needed to call his mom.

11:10.127 --> 11:12.463
-And?
-<i>But he said he needed</i>

11:12.546 --> 11:14.674
<i>to go home to charge it,</i>

11:14.757 --> 11:17.134
<i>so Ji-hu followed him there.</i>

11:23.891 --> 11:26.811
<i>The culprit is a 13-year-old minor</i>

11:26.894 --> 11:29.688
<i>who lives in the same
apartment complex as the victim.</i>

11:30.356 --> 11:32.525
<i>He's small, only around 160cm tall.</i>

11:32.608 --> 11:35.403
<i>He strangled the eight-year-old to death,</i>

11:36.153 --> 11:40.324
<i>mutilated the body with a hatchet,
and disposed of the body.</i>

11:40.408 --> 11:44.245
<i>He disposed of some internal organs
and body parts in the food waste bin,</i>

11:44.328 --> 11:47.373
<i>so they had to hold the funeral
without some parts of the body.</i>

11:52.503 --> 11:57.425
He didn't know the victim
and committed the crime in broad daylight

11:57.508 --> 12:00.803
at an apartment complex near
a police station and an elementary school.

12:02.721 --> 12:07.893
This is what juvenile crimes
are like these days.

12:10.646 --> 12:15.025
Kidnapping, murder,
body mutilation, and disposal.

12:15.651 --> 12:18.696
But the culprit is a young offender.

12:19.447 --> 12:23.409
Even the maximum 20-year sentence
would cause an uproar.

12:23.492 --> 12:26.745
Yet we can only sentence him to two years
in a juvenile reformatory

12:28.330 --> 12:30.916
because he's not 14 years old yet.

12:31.000 --> 12:32.668
NAME: BAEK SEONG-U
13 YEARS OLD

12:32.751 --> 12:35.379
We're definitely going to come under fire.

12:42.094 --> 12:44.638
I heard that you were famous
since your trainee days.

12:44.722 --> 12:48.893
You surpassed all your male classmates
and entered the Central District Court.

12:49.435 --> 12:52.271
And you even went overseas
for further training on top of that.

12:52.354 --> 12:54.148
Seems like you were
on a prime elite course.

12:54.648 --> 12:57.109
Good luck on this case

12:58.027 --> 12:59.862
since you were assigned as the judge.

13:01.113 --> 13:02.156
Yes, sir.

13:06.410 --> 13:09.371
The result may have already been decided,

13:09.955 --> 13:13.209
but all eyes will be on us.

13:15.044 --> 13:16.253
We have to be careful.

13:20.633 --> 13:24.762
As you may have noticed,
things are different here

13:24.845 --> 13:27.806
than they were
at the juvenile court you're from.

13:28.390 --> 13:31.393
You were only in charge
of juvenile protection cases, right?

13:31.977 --> 13:33.729
Here, at the
Juvenile Criminal Collegiate Division,

13:33.812 --> 13:37.650
we do juvenile protection cases
as well as juvenile criminal cases.

13:37.733 --> 13:41.570
The associate judge must read
about 80 cases per week,

13:41.654 --> 13:44.949
so that's about 300 cases a month,
give or take.

13:47.243 --> 13:49.912
Juvenile criminal cases
go through the collegial court

13:49.995 --> 13:52.122
and the rulings are delivered
to Presiding Judge Kang.

13:52.206 --> 13:55.668
Protection cases are done individually
according to the day of the week.

13:55.751 --> 13:57.670
There are a lot of unsolved cases.

13:59.171 --> 14:01.131
And here's the data you asked for.

14:03.926 --> 14:07.388
And I'm sorry about earlier.

14:07.471 --> 14:08.973
When I heard your name,

14:09.765 --> 14:11.725
I thought you were a man.

14:11.809 --> 14:14.478
Are you sure you're not disappointed
because I'm not a man?

14:15.896 --> 14:16.730
Pardon?

14:16.814 --> 14:19.149
Of course not.

14:20.442 --> 14:21.360
Yes?

14:28.784 --> 14:30.077
Nice to meet you.

14:30.160 --> 14:32.746
I'm Joo Yeong-sil, a judicial mediator.

14:32.830 --> 14:35.666
I'm Seo Beom, the assisting officer.

14:35.749 --> 14:37.084
Okay.

14:44.592 --> 14:46.677
Is this all
for the Yeonhwa Child Murder case?

14:46.760 --> 14:48.554
Yes, it's quite a lot.

14:48.637 --> 14:51.181
-The culprit's name's Baek Seong-u, right?
-Yes.

14:51.265 --> 14:53.934
Let's book a date for the trial
as soon as possible.

14:54.018 --> 14:57.146
It's not an ordinary case,
so contact the victim's family.

14:57.229 --> 14:58.522
Yes. ma'am.

15:00.983 --> 15:03.068
It's almost MJ time.

15:03.152 --> 15:05.863
Presiding Judge Kang won't be joining us
since he has other plans.

15:07.573 --> 15:10.200
It's a tradition at our courthouse.

15:10.284 --> 15:12.119
It's short for, "meal with the judges."

15:12.703 --> 15:16.040
The kids who have been released,
the judge in charge,

15:16.123 --> 15:18.709
and the staff all gather
to have lunch together.

15:18.792 --> 15:21.503
We have a meal with the kids
and listen to their problems.

15:21.587 --> 15:23.380
It has quite a positive effect on them.

15:23.464 --> 15:25.090
Okay. Go ahead.

15:25.925 --> 15:28.260
You have to come too.

15:28.344 --> 15:30.554
The lunch will be meaningless

15:30.638 --> 15:32.056
if you and
Presiding Judge Kang aren't there.

15:32.139 --> 15:34.808
It's not like I sentenced the kids.

15:35.809 --> 15:38.062
Caring for the kids after their release

15:38.145 --> 15:40.481
is also one of the duties
of a Juvenile Court judge.

15:44.443 --> 15:47.780
You may not have judged their trials,
but they're still your responsibility.

15:48.322 --> 15:49.823
They'll be looking forward to it.

15:56.830 --> 15:58.123
Do I have to go?

15:59.917 --> 16:02.294
Are you giving up
on taekwondo for good, Do-seok?

16:02.878 --> 16:03.879
Yes.

16:04.546 --> 16:07.091
But I'm still looking
into becoming a security guard.

16:07.675 --> 16:10.260
I already got a license
and passed the GED at the facility.

16:10.928 --> 16:13.305
-I'm proud of you.
-Thank you.

16:14.682 --> 16:17.017
Yu-ri. How's your grandmother?

16:18.227 --> 16:20.104
She's doing a lot better.

16:20.187 --> 16:24.358
I'm getting my paycheck soon.

16:24.441 --> 16:28.070
I'll pay you back for the medicine
you bought for my grandma.

16:30.364 --> 16:32.574
I heard you're going
to start training soon.

16:32.658 --> 16:34.201
You don't need to pay me back.

16:34.284 --> 16:36.036
Just give me a haircut someday.

16:36.120 --> 16:37.162
Me?

16:37.246 --> 16:39.415
Make me look like BTS.
You can do it, right?

16:39.498 --> 16:41.291
I need to know how good you are, right?

16:43.293 --> 16:46.672
You know, the director at the facility
has been complimenting you,

16:46.755 --> 16:48.173
saying you turned over a new leaf.

16:49.383 --> 16:51.343
Since you're now officially released,

16:51.427 --> 16:53.012
-how about we have a toast?
-Okay.

16:53.595 --> 16:54.847
-Congratulations.
-Congratulations.

16:54.930 --> 16:55.806
Thank you.

16:57.808 --> 16:59.435
-I have to use the restroom.
-Sure.

17:02.521 --> 17:04.148
He really adores them, doesn't he?

17:04.815 --> 17:08.193
I think the kids know that.
They are very fond of him as well.

17:12.364 --> 17:14.825
-Thank you for the food.
-Sure.

17:14.908 --> 17:16.785
-Come with me.
-Thank you for the food.

17:17.911 --> 17:19.663
Excuse me. Could you hold on a second?

17:24.376 --> 17:27.838
I didn't do it! How many times
have I told you? It wasn't me!

17:27.921 --> 17:31.091
You bumped into me in the bathroom.
That's when you stole my purse.

17:36.346 --> 17:38.766
I did bump into you,
but I didn't steal it.

17:38.849 --> 17:40.142
I swear!

17:41.769 --> 17:42.895
I'm sorry.

17:42.978 --> 17:44.104
It's fine.

17:44.855 --> 17:47.357
I was willing to let it go
if you apologized.

17:47.441 --> 17:49.359
This won't do.

17:49.443 --> 17:52.488
I overheard that
you have criminal records.

17:53.155 --> 17:57.117
-Call the police, now!
-Please just calm down, ma'am.

17:57.201 --> 17:58.118
The police…

17:58.202 --> 18:00.829
They do have criminal records, don't they?

18:00.913 --> 18:02.539
Fuck.

18:02.623 --> 18:03.957
"Fuck"?

18:04.041 --> 18:04.875
Seol-ah.

18:04.958 --> 18:06.418
I swear it wasn't me.

18:07.294 --> 18:09.004
I didn't do it!

18:11.465 --> 18:13.926
Please…

18:14.009 --> 18:16.970
Please believe me. I didn't do it.

18:17.971 --> 18:20.557
Let's just call the police.
This is a waste of time.

18:23.102 --> 18:26.230
Judge Sim, she was released
just a few hours ago.

18:26.313 --> 18:27.356
Exactly.

18:29.441 --> 18:31.318
It's only been a few hours.

18:32.444 --> 18:33.445
How dare she.

18:36.156 --> 18:39.118
I won't go to the police station!
It wasn't me!

18:39.201 --> 18:41.453
-It wasn't me!
-Seol-ah.

18:41.537 --> 18:43.789
-I swear I didn't do it!
-Seol-ah, wait.

18:43.872 --> 18:45.958
-I won't repeat myself.
-Calm down.

18:46.041 --> 18:48.669
-Send her to the police station.
-It wasn't me!

18:57.928 --> 18:58.929
Judge Sim.

18:59.847 --> 19:00.889
Judge Sim!

19:02.266 --> 19:04.226
Don't you know that everyone's innocent
until proven guilty?

19:04.309 --> 19:07.604
What you did just now
disregarded her right to defend herself.

19:09.189 --> 19:11.150
You could've heard her out.

19:11.233 --> 19:13.569
Don't you care about her feelings?

19:13.652 --> 19:14.987
Why should I?

19:15.863 --> 19:19.324
How could she possibly prove
that she's innocent?

19:19.408 --> 19:21.034
They'll assume she's guilty
because of her records.

19:21.118 --> 19:22.035
Could she…

19:23.579 --> 19:24.496
really be innocent?

19:25.289 --> 19:26.623
Judge Sim!

19:27.791 --> 19:29.001
They found the wallet.

19:29.084 --> 19:32.087
It was under the table next to them.
She must've dropped it.

19:35.299 --> 19:37.926
Let's go. You can see for yourself.

19:42.598 --> 19:43.807
You must have been upset.

19:49.313 --> 19:50.856
Are you okay?

19:50.939 --> 19:52.441
I'm so sorry, sir.

19:53.108 --> 19:56.445
We should've looked more thoroughly.

19:56.528 --> 19:57.779
I'm really sorry.

19:57.863 --> 19:59.072
-We're sorry.
-We're sorry.

20:00.032 --> 20:01.491
I told you it wasn't me.

20:06.955 --> 20:08.707
I swore it wasn't me.

20:17.883 --> 20:19.009
Apologize.

20:22.429 --> 20:23.764
Apologize for suspecting me.

20:25.057 --> 20:26.767
Apologize!

20:29.228 --> 20:31.063
I don't think so.

20:32.773 --> 20:33.774
Because…

20:35.025 --> 20:36.652
I saw everything.

20:38.737 --> 20:39.780
Left pocket.

20:48.163 --> 20:50.415
You didn't do it, right?

20:50.499 --> 20:52.876
It's okay. Just say so.

20:55.462 --> 20:56.755
I didn't do it.

20:59.258 --> 21:01.468
-Ms. Joo.
-Seol-ah.

21:02.302 --> 21:03.262
Show us your pocket.

21:03.345 --> 21:04.513
-I didn't do it!
-I know.

21:04.596 --> 21:06.265
-I didn't do it!
-Seol-ah.

21:06.348 --> 21:08.058
It wasn't me!

21:26.868 --> 21:27.786
That's…

21:32.749 --> 21:36.545
This is why I despise the likes of you.

21:39.506 --> 21:43.010
You never really change.

21:51.685 --> 21:54.521
Turn her over to the police.

21:55.939 --> 21:57.316
See you at the courthouse.

22:07.492 --> 22:10.787
-Did you see Judge Sim's face?
-Yes.

22:10.871 --> 22:13.498
Thank god we met as co-workers.

22:13.582 --> 22:15.667
If I met her as a young offender,

22:15.751 --> 22:16.918
I would've balled my eyes out.

22:17.002 --> 22:19.338
No wonder they call her "Judge Max".

22:19.421 --> 22:21.089
I'm sorry? "Judge Max"?

22:21.173 --> 22:22.424
Yes, "Judge Max."

22:22.924 --> 22:25.218
When she was the only judge
at the juvenile division,

22:25.302 --> 22:27.637
she would give out
maximum sentences to young offenders.

22:27.721 --> 22:28.889
Hence the nickname.

22:28.972 --> 22:30.724
Kids these days are even saying,

22:30.807 --> 22:33.518
"No matter what happens, avoid Judge Max."

22:34.478 --> 22:38.023
According to the rumors, she always works
overtime and on the weekends.

22:38.106 --> 22:40.609
Even the court's labor union
has its eyes on her.

22:40.692 --> 22:42.486
In other words, we're totally screwed.

22:43.403 --> 22:44.571
Gosh.

22:44.654 --> 22:45.906
Get to work.

22:45.989 --> 22:46.907
Okay.

22:55.248 --> 22:57.501
I just came from the police station.

22:57.584 --> 23:00.420
Don't trust the kids too much.
They're lying half of the time.

23:03.590 --> 23:07.594
You shouldn't have pushed her like that
when everyone was watching.

23:07.677 --> 23:09.429
They're also human and they have rights.

23:10.097 --> 23:11.932
Rights, my ass.

23:13.809 --> 23:15.477
You think you're a good adult?

23:16.061 --> 23:20.065
Kids like you and they open up to you.

23:21.066 --> 23:24.528
But do you think those kids
also think you're a good adult?

23:25.821 --> 23:27.072
I'm dying to know.

23:37.791 --> 23:38.917
EDUCATION
MIDDLE SCHOOL OR LOWER

23:39.000 --> 23:40.043
ABSENT FROM SCHOOL FOR OVER A WEEK

23:48.135 --> 23:49.636
BROKEN FAMILY
PARENTS DIVORCED

23:49.719 --> 23:51.012
SINGLE PARENT HOUSEHOLD

23:53.640 --> 23:54.975
FIRST OFFENSE:
13 YEARS OLD, MURDER

23:56.560 --> 23:58.603
DIAGNOSED WITH SCHIZOPHRENIA

23:58.687 --> 24:00.021
HOSPITALIZED
MEDICINAL TREATMENT

24:06.736 --> 24:08.363
I'm going to call it a day.

24:09.614 --> 24:10.699
Okay.

24:11.992 --> 24:13.326
I have to finish this up.

24:14.202 --> 24:15.078
You go ahead.

24:16.913 --> 24:20.041
I know what you said isn't wrong.

24:21.126 --> 24:22.252
But I don't think…

24:23.795 --> 24:26.047
I'm wrong either.

24:29.593 --> 24:30.677
I'll see you tomorrow.

26:04.646 --> 26:06.147
COURT IN SESSION

26:30.088 --> 26:31.339
Name and date of birth.

26:32.215 --> 26:35.093
Baek Seong-u. Born on November 30, 2008.

26:35.176 --> 26:36.511
Where is his legal guardian?

26:37.053 --> 26:38.263
Aren't they here?

26:38.346 --> 26:39.806
She said she called you.

26:39.889 --> 26:45.353
I got a call.
She said she's going to be late.

26:54.487 --> 26:55.572
First…

26:56.865 --> 26:58.116
tell me what happened.

26:59.117 --> 27:02.245
Everything that happened
on the day of the murder.

27:03.038 --> 27:04.539
To be totally honest,

27:05.707 --> 27:07.167
it was one of those days that

27:07.959 --> 27:09.294
I was just very pissed.

27:15.467 --> 27:17.385
I took my meds but I kept hearing voices.

27:18.928 --> 27:19.846
Excuse me.

27:21.056 --> 27:24.309
Can I borrow your phone?

27:24.392 --> 27:25.643
I have to call my mom.

27:26.311 --> 27:27.729
My phone's dead.

27:28.229 --> 27:30.565
It'll only take a minute.

27:38.365 --> 27:40.116
<i>I took him home
using the phone as an excuse,</i>

27:40.784 --> 27:42.994
but once we got there,
the voices were gone.

27:43.078 --> 27:45.538
I was going to send him home
because I felt bad for him.

27:46.164 --> 27:47.082
But…

27:47.582 --> 27:48.583
<i>Hey!</i>

27:51.127 --> 27:52.670
This is a new game, right?

27:52.754 --> 27:54.714
Can I please play this?

27:54.798 --> 27:57.842
Can I try this VR game?

28:00.470 --> 28:01.388
Goal!

28:01.471 --> 28:03.973
<i>I told him to go home,
but he kept blabbering on!</i>

28:04.057 --> 28:06.976
<i>The voices were back
and I had a splitting headache.</i>

28:13.316 --> 28:15.235
We're going to play hide-and-seek.

28:16.152 --> 28:18.488
Don't come out until I find you, okay?

28:18.571 --> 28:21.658
If you come out, I will kill you.

28:23.493 --> 28:24.536
Got it?

28:26.079 --> 28:27.163
And at home?

28:28.706 --> 28:29.749
Wasn't anyone there?

28:29.833 --> 28:31.459
I'm usually home alone.

28:31.543 --> 28:32.544
CERTIFICATE OF FAMILY RELATIONS

28:32.627 --> 28:34.254
Mom's busy teaching at the academy.

28:40.677 --> 28:42.470
Would you like to hear something funny?

28:55.275 --> 28:58.278
Do you know where he was hiding?

29:03.742 --> 29:05.160
Ji-hu.

29:09.581 --> 29:10.874
Ji-hu.

29:16.713 --> 29:18.840
Ji-hu.

29:47.702 --> 29:48.828
I found you.

29:54.459 --> 29:55.752
You had to see his face.

30:00.715 --> 30:01.966
That fucking asshole…

30:16.231 --> 30:19.859
I heard kids under 14

30:20.401 --> 30:22.487
don't go to prison
even if they kill someone.

30:23.780 --> 30:24.989
Is that true?

30:31.371 --> 30:32.330
That's awesome.

30:39.462 --> 30:41.005
Where…

30:44.300 --> 30:45.260
Court dismissed.

30:45.343 --> 30:47.136
-Ma'am.
-Your Honor.

30:47.220 --> 30:48.888
What happened to Seong-u?

30:49.556 --> 30:50.932
Where is he?

30:52.433 --> 30:54.686
Are you Seong-u's mother?

30:54.769 --> 30:55.603
Yes.

30:55.687 --> 30:56.855
You're late.

30:57.647 --> 30:59.816
Yes, I had to work.

31:01.025 --> 31:02.193
Work?

31:04.988 --> 31:07.490
I heard on the news
that he won't have to go to prison.

31:07.574 --> 31:10.660
How long will he be staying
at the Juvenile Classification Center?

31:11.953 --> 31:14.080
Have you met the victim's family?

31:16.374 --> 31:17.208
No.

31:19.878 --> 31:21.254
Apologize to them first.

31:29.804 --> 31:33.099
What a difficult case.
Both the kid and his mom.

31:34.559 --> 31:37.353
People tend to show
their true nature when they're cornered.

31:38.646 --> 31:40.899
That's why humans are evil.

31:49.532 --> 31:52.368
Judge Sim, Ji-hu's mom is here.

31:56.414 --> 31:58.583
I heard he's a young offender.

32:00.793 --> 32:02.003
Is it true

32:03.087 --> 32:04.589
that he won't go to prison?

32:07.550 --> 32:09.385
How is someone so young

32:10.553 --> 32:11.971
capable of murder?

32:12.805 --> 32:14.432
How can a human being

32:16.059 --> 32:18.478
cut off another person's limbs?

32:20.605 --> 32:22.065
But how come

32:22.690 --> 32:24.567
he won't go to prison for it?

32:31.491 --> 32:32.325
Ma'am.

32:32.408 --> 32:35.870
Ji-hu keeps appearing in my dreams.

32:37.038 --> 32:38.706
And he just cries.

32:40.458 --> 32:42.043
He doesn't say anything.

32:43.336 --> 32:45.546
He just cries, Your Honor.

32:50.635 --> 32:55.014
At Ji-hu's first birthday party,
he grabbed the yarn.

32:56.474 --> 32:57.809
But that yarn…

32:59.018 --> 33:00.979
was a hand-me-down from his older brother.

33:02.105 --> 33:03.648
So it was a little worn out.

33:07.276 --> 33:09.320
Could it be because of that?

33:13.032 --> 33:15.451
Was that the reason why poor Ji-hu…

33:18.705 --> 33:20.373
It's all my fault.

33:22.375 --> 33:24.168
It's all my fault.

33:36.014 --> 33:38.516
These are Ji-hu's favorite dishes.

33:39.350 --> 33:41.144
I heard you can't accept anything else.

34:06.127 --> 34:07.128
Thank you.

34:13.468 --> 34:16.721
<i>HANWOOL DAILY</i>
REPORTER KIM HYEONG-JUN

34:18.973 --> 34:20.808
<i>I think that's enough for the interview.</i>

34:20.892 --> 34:24.145
Gosh, this is too much.

34:24.228 --> 34:26.481
You're making me uneasy, Reporter Kim.

34:26.564 --> 34:27.523
Gosh.

34:28.316 --> 34:31.110
You made time for us
during your busy schedule.

34:31.194 --> 34:33.362
Of course we should treat you
to something nice.

34:33.446 --> 34:35.740
-Thanks.
-You'll be hearing good news soon.

34:37.617 --> 34:39.243
Good news?

34:40.495 --> 34:41.996
Maybe I shouldn't have.

34:42.747 --> 34:44.207
Should I tell you?

34:46.959 --> 34:49.295
I heard this from a colleague
who's a political correspondent.

34:50.630 --> 34:54.092
The Liberty Party is looking for
a new candidate for the upcoming election

34:54.675 --> 34:56.844
and they have you in mind.

34:58.554 --> 35:00.515
<i>You're pretty well-known</i>

35:00.598 --> 35:02.934
<i>since you're on TV
and in charge of a big case.</i>

35:03.017 --> 35:05.186
<i>Just make sure to
wrap this case up quietly.</i>

35:05.686 --> 35:07.480
<i>I'll set up a meeting.</i>

35:44.267 --> 35:45.560
YUN JI-HU

35:49.814 --> 35:52.275
<i>These are Ji-hu's favorite dishes.</i>

35:52.358 --> 35:54.694
I heard you can't accept anything else.

36:33.691 --> 36:36.861
YUN JI-HU

37:50.601 --> 37:54.063
Enforce harsher punishment
for young violent offenders!

37:54.146 --> 37:56.232
-Enforce!
-Enforce!

37:56.315 --> 37:58.651
Abolish the Juvenile Act!

37:59.235 --> 38:00.987
Juvenile Criminal Collegiate Division.

38:01.654 --> 38:03.072
You sent the file?

38:03.155 --> 38:05.866
Okay. I'll relay it
to Judge Sim right away.

38:05.950 --> 38:06.993
Okay.

38:08.661 --> 38:11.956
Baek Seong-u is already undergoing
his second therapy session.

38:12.039 --> 38:14.083
Judge Sim wanted me to find her a file.

38:14.166 --> 38:16.627
It's information
on the Yeonhwa Child Murder case.

38:22.091 --> 38:26.971
So you're saying you're still
suffering from schizophrenia?

38:28.055 --> 38:29.015
Yes.

38:29.098 --> 38:32.184
Lying will only make things worse.

38:33.227 --> 38:34.270
I know.

38:35.229 --> 38:38.107
So the motive for your crime
was schizophrenia?

38:39.191 --> 38:40.109
Yes.

38:40.192 --> 38:44.071
You admit luring the boy to your house,
murdering him

38:44.155 --> 38:45.948
and mutilating his body?

38:46.615 --> 38:47.491
Yes.

38:49.702 --> 38:50.953
Why'd you turn yourself in?

38:53.372 --> 38:55.499
Because you're a young offender?

38:55.583 --> 38:57.460
God damn it.

38:59.962 --> 39:01.088
Yes!

39:04.425 --> 39:05.468
Here.

39:20.107 --> 39:22.568
SCHIZOPHRENIA, BIPOLAR AFFECTIVE DISORDER
ANXIETY, NEUROSIS

39:31.285 --> 39:32.119
You…

39:38.542 --> 39:40.169
didn't do it, did you?

39:48.969 --> 39:51.222
<i>There are many symptoms of schizophrenia.</i>

39:52.598 --> 39:55.601
Some believe
there's someone trying to hurt them.

39:55.684 --> 39:59.146
Others hear things, see things,
smell things and even feel things.

39:59.230 --> 40:02.400
The problem is the symptoms are
different for everyone.

40:02.483 --> 40:04.110
But what they all have in common is

40:04.193 --> 40:07.905
there's no cure for schizophrenia.

40:09.073 --> 40:13.077
It's hard for them to concentrate
on something for long periods of time.

40:15.788 --> 40:16.831
<i>But…</i>

40:19.834 --> 40:21.293
if they commit murder?

40:22.545 --> 40:26.799
<i>Schizophrenics usually get caught
red-handed without cleaning up the scene.</i>

40:27.675 --> 40:31.345
<i>Cleaning up a crime scene
requires high concentration</i>

40:31.429 --> 40:33.556
<i>so it causes a lot of stress.</i>

40:34.140 --> 40:36.392
<i>But not only
did you clean the crime scene,</i>

40:36.475 --> 40:40.104
you lured the kid, planned the murder,
mutilated, and disposed of the corpse!

40:41.021 --> 40:43.190
And you say that
schizophrenia made you do it.

40:45.901 --> 40:47.027
Did you get any better?

40:47.111 --> 40:49.280
ADDITIONAL PSYCHOTROPIC DRUGS ADMINISTERED

40:50.448 --> 40:53.951
There are two reasons
why criminals hide their motives.

40:55.035 --> 40:57.413
One is when things are unfavorable to them

40:57.496 --> 41:00.583
and the other is when there's…

41:02.376 --> 41:04.378
another perpetrator involved in the crime.

41:07.673 --> 41:10.551
But you're using
the Juvenile Act as a shield.

41:10.634 --> 41:13.262
Everything seems favorable to you.

41:14.013 --> 41:16.223
So it must be the other reason.

41:17.892 --> 41:19.018
Damn it.

41:20.060 --> 41:21.979
There's another perpetrator…

41:25.649 --> 41:27.026
who's involved in this crime.

41:27.818 --> 41:31.530
Can I borrow your phone?
I have to call my mom.

41:47.171 --> 41:48.380
No!

41:49.507 --> 41:50.424
Not her!

41:50.508 --> 41:52.635
She has nothing to do with this.

41:52.718 --> 41:54.261
I'm telling you.

41:54.345 --> 41:56.680
She has nothing to do with this.

41:56.764 --> 41:58.849
I knew something was off.

42:00.100 --> 42:02.269
Why would the victim
follow a stranger to their house

42:02.353 --> 42:05.481
even if he had to use the phone urgently?

42:05.564 --> 42:08.901
And if you were going to turn yourself in,

42:10.069 --> 42:11.904
why would you dispose of the body?

42:11.987 --> 42:14.823
-Murder, body mutilation, and disposal!
-Baek Seong-u.

42:16.283 --> 42:17.785
You weren't the one who did it.

42:23.707 --> 42:25.876
Judge Sim. The information you wanted.

42:37.763 --> 42:39.056
HAN YE-EUN
MOM

42:43.143 --> 42:44.061
It's her, isn't it?

43:06.292 --> 43:07.626
I told you

43:08.294 --> 43:09.795
lying would only…

43:11.297 --> 43:12.339
make things worse.

43:14.258 --> 43:15.551
Call his legal guardian

43:17.428 --> 43:19.430
and send him back to the
Juvenile Classification Center.

43:20.472 --> 43:21.849
Fuck!

43:21.932 --> 43:22.891
No!

43:22.975 --> 43:25.728
She has nothing to do with this!

43:25.811 --> 43:27.813
I want to go home!

43:27.896 --> 43:28.981
Fuck!

43:31.483 --> 43:33.319
<i>What do you mean?</i>

43:34.612 --> 43:36.655
Just quit if you're going to
spew such nonsense.

43:36.739 --> 43:39.992
Do you think we're the police?
Why are you stepping over the line?

43:40.075 --> 43:41.869
Everything fits.

43:42.661 --> 43:43.662
We need to check.

43:43.746 --> 43:45.706
Do you think the police are stupid?

43:45.789 --> 43:47.666
Do you think they handed over the case
without looking into it?

43:47.750 --> 43:48.834
He turned himself in.

43:48.917 --> 43:52.004
He had the murder weapon
and was suffering from schizophrenia.

43:53.130 --> 43:54.798
They trusted his confession.

43:56.216 --> 43:57.384
But they're wrong.

43:58.135 --> 43:59.511
There's an accomplice.

44:01.096 --> 44:04.016
It couldn't have been Baek Seong-u
because of his schizophrenia.

44:04.099 --> 44:05.225
Do you have proof?

44:05.309 --> 44:07.227
I have records of phone calls and texts
before and after the murder.

44:07.311 --> 44:09.897
I also have footage of her
getting on an elevator with the victim

44:09.980 --> 44:11.690
wearing the same school uniform
as Baek Seong-u

44:11.774 --> 44:13.067
and Baek Seong-u's doctor's referral.

44:13.150 --> 44:14.151
Do you need more?

44:21.283 --> 44:23.911
So you want to send the case
back to the police?

44:23.994 --> 44:25.704
The whole nation is focused on this case.

44:25.788 --> 44:27.790
The press already has
all their stories out.

44:27.873 --> 44:30.125
Do you really think
the police will admit their own fault?

44:31.543 --> 44:32.961
I'll go catch her myself.

44:33.045 --> 44:34.004
You're a judge!

44:34.088 --> 44:38.133
It is also a judge's duty to get to
the bottom of a case through due process.

44:38.217 --> 44:40.469
Right now,
it's a juvenile protection case,

44:40.552 --> 44:43.263
but if there's an accomplice
over the age of 14,

44:44.014 --> 44:46.600
it's a juvenile criminal case.

44:46.684 --> 44:48.560
We're the only juvenile
criminal court with jurisdiction,

44:48.644 --> 44:49.937
and you want to keep it under wraps?

44:50.020 --> 44:53.357
And what if you're wrong?
What if you screw everything up?

44:53.440 --> 44:54.358
I'll take responsibility.

44:54.441 --> 44:55.984
Like shit you will! What the hell…

44:57.820 --> 45:00.948
Just shut up
and proceed with the trial by the book.

45:01.031 --> 45:04.118
-Sir!
-We can't afford to make such a scene!

45:04.201 --> 45:06.370
Do you understand? I'm…

45:07.955 --> 45:09.748
I'm giving you a direct order.

45:15.796 --> 45:17.131
Leave.

45:17.214 --> 45:18.173
Get out of my sight.

45:22.302 --> 45:23.262
Get out!

45:37.609 --> 45:38.652
What the hell…

45:40.362 --> 45:42.489
THE CULPRIT OF THE YEONHWA CHILD
MURDER CASE WILL BE SEVERELY PUNISHED

45:42.573 --> 45:44.700
ACCORDING TO YEONHWA DISTRICT COURT
JUDGE KANG WON-JUNG

45:44.783 --> 45:46.618
<i>You're pretty well-known</i>

45:46.702 --> 45:49.455
<i>since you're on TV
and in charge of a big case.</i>

45:51.498 --> 45:53.834
Just make sure to
wrap this case up quietly.

45:55.836 --> 45:56.753
Damn it.

46:06.472 --> 46:08.348
I agree with Presiding Judge Kang.

46:09.933 --> 46:11.935
It's just too risky.

46:12.019 --> 46:12.936
If this gets out,

46:13.020 --> 46:15.856
Han Ye-eun's personal information
will be all over the place.

46:15.939 --> 46:17.608
But what if she didn't do it?

46:18.400 --> 46:21.236
The court will be destroying her family.

46:23.238 --> 46:25.741
Proceed with Baek Seong-u's trial first.

46:25.824 --> 46:27.784
-Then investigate later--
-Later when?

46:28.410 --> 46:30.245
After the victim's parents are dead?

46:30.996 --> 46:32.331
Should we do it then?

46:33.081 --> 46:34.583
-Judge Sim.
-Please.

46:36.960 --> 46:38.504
Just let me do my job.

46:53.477 --> 46:54.394
JUVENILE PROTECTION CASE

46:56.188 --> 46:58.982
YUN JI-HU

47:11.870 --> 47:15.249
COURT

47:18.835 --> 47:22.005
And what if you're wrong?
What if you screw everything up?

47:22.089 --> 47:25.092
The court will be destroying her family.

47:37.563 --> 47:38.939
What are you doing here?

47:40.274 --> 47:42.109
I've been looking for you all over.

47:53.453 --> 47:55.372
Let's catch the accomplice.

47:58.458 --> 48:00.877
We need proof
to convince Presiding Judge Kang.

48:02.337 --> 48:03.880
What's with you all of a sudden?

48:03.964 --> 48:04.923
Because…

48:06.258 --> 48:08.302
I found some confidence.

48:11.763 --> 48:12.639
Thank you.

48:13.390 --> 48:14.391
Detective Ko.

48:15.517 --> 48:16.768
Hello.

48:16.852 --> 48:18.812
Hello, Judge Cha.

48:18.895 --> 48:21.565
I was hoping to ask you
some questions about Baek Seong-u.

48:22.107 --> 48:23.525
Oh, Baek Seong-u?

48:24.901 --> 48:28.071
Could you tell me what happened
when he turned himself in?

48:29.865 --> 48:33.243
<i>The first time I saw him was
in front of the police station.</i>

48:34.328 --> 48:35.871
<i>He seemed very nervous.</i>

48:35.954 --> 48:37.456
Let's talk inside the police station.

48:37.539 --> 48:40.042
<i>He didn't seem like he was
going to turn himself in at first.</i>

48:40.125 --> 48:42.210
<i>But, how do I say this…</i>

48:42.294 --> 48:44.296
<i>It's like he changed all of a sudden.</i>

48:44.379 --> 48:47.841
I killed someone.

48:49.176 --> 48:51.219
<i>His expression changed
in the blink of an eye.</i>

48:52.179 --> 48:53.013
<i>Wait.</i>

48:53.597 --> 48:55.515
-Sorry?
-There.

48:57.934 --> 49:00.187
What is he looking at?

49:00.937 --> 49:03.482
Is it possible to see
the footage from the other side?

49:23.043 --> 49:26.880
To be honest,
I'll never understand the way

49:28.006 --> 49:29.257
you treat young offenders.

49:31.802 --> 49:34.346
But if a trial is held in our court

49:34.971 --> 49:36.890
only for that boy

49:37.391 --> 49:39.142
when there's an accomplice,

49:40.102 --> 49:42.145
it's an insult to our court.

49:43.105 --> 49:44.356
Which is a whole other issue.

49:50.153 --> 49:51.405
I'll help you.

49:52.406 --> 49:55.909
I'm also an associate judge after all.

50:03.375 --> 50:05.419
It won't be easy for you to do this alone.

50:05.961 --> 50:10.298
You don't know where the kids are from
or what kind of networks they have formed.

50:11.383 --> 50:13.844
Han Ye-eun dropped out of Yeonju
Girls' High School in her freshman year.

50:13.927 --> 50:18.724
Then who else went to Yeonju Girls' High
among the cases we handled?

50:20.934 --> 50:22.978
WOO SEOL-AH
ADMITTED: DEC 21, 2021

50:24.104 --> 50:25.897
You never know, right?

50:26.732 --> 50:29.484
How things will turn out, I mean.

50:30.736 --> 50:31.945
I don't want to.

50:32.904 --> 50:34.197
I won't help.

50:34.281 --> 50:35.741
Please, Seol-ah.

50:37.743 --> 50:40.162
Have I ever asked you for anything before?

50:40.662 --> 50:42.247
Just this once.

50:46.334 --> 50:49.045
Han Ye-eun frequents
an internet cafe on Juseong-ro.

50:49.129 --> 50:50.922
You have a driver's license, right?

50:51.506 --> 50:54.801
I'm still making installment payments…

50:54.885 --> 50:57.512
I'll head over to Han Ye-eun's place.

50:57.596 --> 51:00.056
She'll be waiting
for Baek Seong-u to message her.

51:34.257 --> 51:35.550
Are you out of your mind?

51:35.634 --> 51:37.093
What do you think you're doing?

51:37.761 --> 51:40.305
Please let Seong-u go. Please.

51:40.388 --> 51:41.848
Please let him go.

51:41.932 --> 51:45.393
I gave birth to him.
I know him better than anyone.

51:45.477 --> 51:48.271
Every parent who comes here
says the exact same thing.

51:57.155 --> 51:58.782
Please let him go!

52:01.117 --> 52:02.244
Move.

52:02.327 --> 52:03.912
I won't ask again!

52:07.374 --> 52:10.377
Please help him.

52:10.460 --> 52:12.838
So get out of the way!

53:05.056 --> 53:06.975
-Who the hell are you?
-Sorry.

53:11.938 --> 53:13.607
What do you think you're doing?

53:13.690 --> 53:16.359
We received a tip that a young offender
we're looking for is here.

53:16.443 --> 53:19.112
-Please cooperate.
-Are you with the police?

53:19.821 --> 53:22.532
You can call them if you want.

53:24.743 --> 53:27.954
You do know that it's illegal
to have minors here after 10 p.m., right?

53:28.997 --> 53:32.208
You could be sentenced up to two years
in prison and fined up to 20 million won.

53:33.835 --> 53:35.170
It's up to you.

53:35.879 --> 53:37.380
You just need to catch the kid, right?

53:40.842 --> 53:42.677
Do judges go looking for kids these days?

53:54.022 --> 53:55.273
Call the probation office.

53:55.941 --> 53:57.734
<i>Did you find her? Is Han Ye-eun there?</i>

53:58.276 --> 54:00.362
I Sens Internet Cafe on Juseong-ro.
Call them now.

54:14.668 --> 54:16.378
You know Baek Seong-u, right?

Come quietly.

54:40.610 --> 54:42.028

-What the hell?

54:42.612 --> 54:44.155
Who the hell was that?

54:55.208 --> 54:56.459
My goodness!

54:57.210 --> 54:58.461
It's all ruined!

55:14.060 --> 55:15.812
-Mister, go! Go now!
-What the hell?

55:15.895 --> 55:18.189
-Go!

55:45.633 --> 55:47.093
Move it! Fuck!
