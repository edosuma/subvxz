WEBVTT

00:09.487 --> 00:13.535
Mm, 9:30.

00:13.622 --> 00:15.580
[gasps]
9:30!

00:16.581 --> 00:17.234
Roscoe!

00:17.321 --> 00:17.974
Violet!

00:18.061 --> 00:19.845
Oh...

00:19.932 --> 00:20.977
Oh... We're late!

00:21.064 --> 00:22.413
Come on!

00:22.500 --> 00:22.979
Hey, guys, wake up!

00:23.066 --> 00:24.850
Wake up!

00:24.937 --> 00:25.895
We're late!

00:25.982 --> 00:27.027
Come on!

00:27.114 --> 00:28.811
Roscoe! Violet!

00:28.898 --> 00:29.812
Let's go!

00:29.899 --> 00:31.074
Move, move, move!

00:31.161 --> 00:32.206
[Christy panting]

00:32.293 --> 00:33.685
Can I get a little help here?

00:33.772 --> 00:34.425
I already drove
Roscoe to school.

00:34.512 --> 00:35.948
Croissant?

00:36.036 --> 00:37.776
Oh, I don't have time
for a croissant.

00:37.863 --> 00:39.169
God, Mom!

00:39.256 --> 00:40.779
What are you thinking...
Wait, what?

00:40.866 --> 00:42.477
I took him to school
so you could sleep in.

00:42.564 --> 00:43.304
Oh.

00:43.391 --> 00:44.305
Did he eat?

00:44.392 --> 00:45.262
Yep, made him oatmeal.

00:45.349 --> 00:46.089
He doesn't like oatmeal.

00:46.176 --> 00:48.526
He likes mine.

00:48.613 --> 00:49.919
All right.

00:50.006 --> 00:51.660
What about
his homework?

00:51.747 --> 00:53.053
Did you check that he did it?

00:53.140 --> 00:54.576
'Cause he'll lie
right to your face.

00:54.663 --> 00:56.230
Big smile,
"cross my heart, hope to die."

00:56.317 --> 00:58.449
It's creepy.

00:58.536 --> 01:00.016
I checked his homework.
And don't worry,

01:00.103 --> 01:01.061
I've already made inquiries
about a tutor.

01:03.454 --> 01:04.673
By the way, I took your car...

01:04.760 --> 01:06.153
Oh, Mom, I barely have

01:06.240 --> 01:07.110
enough gas in there
to get to work.

01:07.197 --> 01:08.981
That's why I took it.

01:09.069 --> 01:10.157
I filled it up, got it washed,
the oil light was on...

01:10.244 --> 01:11.158
[sighs]
It's always on.

01:11.245 --> 01:12.333
Actually, it goes off

01:12.420 --> 01:13.029
when you put
oil in it.

01:15.771 --> 01:16.946
Now sit down.

01:17.033 --> 01:18.034
I got you a latte at Starbucks.

01:20.210 --> 01:21.081
Double shot, non-fat?
Yep.

01:21.168 --> 01:23.083
[sighs]

01:23.170 --> 01:25.476
Thanks.

01:27.609 --> 01:29.132
Oh, damn!

01:29.219 --> 01:29.698
Violet had a doctor's
appointment this morning.

01:29.785 --> 01:31.265
I know.

01:31.352 --> 01:32.483
I made sure Luke
got her there on time.

01:32.570 --> 01:34.006
She's gained
three pounds.

01:34.094 --> 01:35.660
The baby's the size
of an heirloom tomato.

01:38.185 --> 01:39.751
Okay.

01:39.838 --> 01:40.578
Good.

01:40.665 --> 01:42.493
[clears throat]

01:42.580 --> 01:44.191
So let me understand this.

01:44.278 --> 01:47.237
You got up at, like, dawn...

01:47.324 --> 01:49.761
washed, dressed and fed Roscoe,

01:49.848 --> 01:51.459
took him to school,
serviced my car,

01:51.546 --> 01:53.374
made sure my daughter
got to the obstetrician

01:53.461 --> 01:55.115
and even managed to get me
a latte and a croissant?

01:55.202 --> 01:57.682
It's the least
I could do

01:57.769 --> 01:58.944
to pay back
your generosity.

01:59.031 --> 02:01.338
Enjoy.

02:01.425 --> 02:03.123
I'm gonna get started
on the laundry.

02:07.605 --> 02:10.042
Mmm...

02:10.130 --> 02:12.132
[sighs]

02:14.917 --> 02:17.354
Why is this pissing me off?

02:34.632 --> 02:37.244
It's so weird.

02:37.331 --> 02:39.594
Everything in my life
right now is fine.

02:39.681 --> 02:40.899
I mean, it's better than fine.

02:40.986 --> 02:41.900
It's, like, good.

02:41.987 --> 02:43.380
My kids are happy,

02:43.467 --> 02:44.686
work is okay,

02:44.773 --> 02:46.470
my mom moved in,

02:46.557 --> 02:47.950
which you'd think would be
a formula for disaster,

02:48.037 --> 02:49.386
but it's actually terrific.

02:49.473 --> 02:50.779
[sighs]

02:50.866 --> 02:55.827
The only problem
I can point to is...

02:55.914 --> 02:58.265
it's so damn boring.

02:58.352 --> 02:59.483
[Christy groans]

02:59.570 --> 03:02.051
I mean, before I got sober,

03:02.138 --> 03:03.487
life was a freakin' thrill ride!

03:03.574 --> 03:05.402
Oh...

03:05.489 --> 03:06.969
You never knew what kind of
cool stuff was gonna happen.

03:07.056 --> 03:08.623
Twice I drove a car
into a swimming pool.

03:08.710 --> 03:09.711
Twice!

03:09.798 --> 03:11.147
Do you know that

03:11.234 --> 03:13.193
without manual windows
I'd be dead?

03:13.280 --> 03:14.846
Twice?

03:14.933 --> 03:16.021
And stomach pumps.

03:16.108 --> 03:17.849
Remember those?
[laughs]

03:17.936 --> 03:20.025
And that charcoal crap,
you know, they made you drink?

03:20.112 --> 03:21.201
Ugh...

03:21.288 --> 03:22.376
One time I asked the paramedic

03:22.463 --> 03:23.377
if he had diet charcoal crap.

03:23.464 --> 03:25.814
Got a big laugh.

03:25.901 --> 03:28.251
And then I threw up on him.

03:28.338 --> 03:31.950
Anyway, thanks for
letting me share.

03:32.037 --> 03:34.388
I thought that maybe if
I talked about it out loud,

03:34.475 --> 03:37.521
you'd be less likely
to see me on the 6:00 news.

03:37.608 --> 03:38.479
Oh, boy.

03:38.566 --> 03:40.263
Those were the days.

03:43.788 --> 03:44.746
Shoot!

03:44.833 --> 03:46.704
Come on, shoot!

03:46.791 --> 03:48.793
Rejected!

03:50.230 --> 03:51.927
Hi.
Hey.

03:52.014 --> 03:53.363
What brought this on?

03:53.450 --> 03:55.060
Oh, Roscoe wanted
to shoot some hoops.

03:55.147 --> 03:57.019
He sucks, by the way.

03:57.106 --> 03:58.934
I know.

03:59.021 --> 04:00.718
Where'd this thing
come from?

04:00.805 --> 04:01.676
The people across the street
were throwing it away.

04:01.763 --> 04:03.982
Oh, that makes sense.

04:04.069 --> 04:06.985
Their son's pretty...
fabulous.

04:07.072 --> 04:08.204
ROSCOE:
Grandma, try to stop me!

04:08.291 --> 04:09.249
Excuse me.

04:11.033 --> 04:14.036
Nope!

04:14.123 --> 04:16.081
It's more fetch
than basketball, really.

04:20.434 --> 04:21.348
Hey.

04:21.435 --> 04:23.567
Hey.

04:23.654 --> 04:25.003
Do we have a Bible?

04:25.090 --> 04:26.831
Uh, we have
a hollowed-out Bible.

04:28.398 --> 04:29.617
Why is it hollow?

04:31.358 --> 04:33.273
I misspoke,
we don't have a Bible.

04:33.360 --> 04:35.579
Why do you want one?

04:35.666 --> 04:36.754
Luke's father thought reading it

04:36.841 --> 04:37.886
might be good for my soul.

04:37.973 --> 04:40.671
Well, you tell Luke's father

04:40.758 --> 04:42.238
that your mother said

04:42.325 --> 04:44.284
that your soul could
kick his soul's ass!

04:46.808 --> 04:48.070
Never mind.

04:48.157 --> 04:49.463
I'll just get one
at the library.

04:49.550 --> 04:52.248
Well, you know,
I do mind.

04:52.335 --> 04:54.511
Luke's dad is forcing
his religion on you,

04:54.598 --> 04:55.425
which is completely
unacceptable.

04:55.512 --> 04:57.297
Why?

04:58.559 --> 04:59.995
'Cause...

05:00.082 --> 05:02.867
that's my job.

05:02.954 --> 05:03.868
But you didn't do it.

05:03.955 --> 05:05.479
We don't have a religion.

05:05.566 --> 05:07.089
Sure we do!

05:07.176 --> 05:08.525
We're just keeping it
on the down-low.

05:11.398 --> 05:13.313
Okay, what is it?

05:13.400 --> 05:16.446
It's...

05:16.533 --> 05:18.448
be nice to people.

05:18.535 --> 05:20.581
Do unto others,

05:20.668 --> 05:22.409
you know, within reason.

05:24.802 --> 05:26.151
That's it?

05:26.238 --> 05:28.023
Where do we stand
on heaven and hell?

05:28.110 --> 05:29.764
Heaven good, hell bad.

05:29.851 --> 05:32.157
What else you got?

05:32.244 --> 05:33.768
What's going on?

05:33.855 --> 05:34.986
Luke's minister father

05:35.073 --> 05:35.509
wants Violet to read the Bible.

05:35.596 --> 05:38.033
So?

05:38.120 --> 05:39.600
So... I'm telling her not to.

05:39.687 --> 05:40.601
Why?

05:40.688 --> 05:42.080
What do you mean, why?

05:42.167 --> 05:43.560
I don't like people
telling her what to do.

05:43.647 --> 05:47.695
Well, aren't you
telling her what to do?

05:47.782 --> 05:50.741
Shouldn't you be outside
humiliating your grandson?

05:52.569 --> 05:54.005
I just think
you should let Violet

05:54.092 --> 05:55.616
make her own decision.

05:55.703 --> 05:57.748
Why are you taking her side?

05:57.835 --> 05:59.489
You didn't raise me
with any kind of religion.

05:59.576 --> 06:00.490
And look how you turned out.

06:03.188 --> 06:04.233
[hisses]

06:08.977 --> 06:10.935
[knocking at door]

06:13.460 --> 06:15.287
Hey, Christy here?

06:15.375 --> 06:16.593
She's taking a bath.
What can I do for you?

06:16.680 --> 06:17.638
It's okay,
I can wait.

06:17.725 --> 06:18.682
Fine.

06:22.164 --> 06:24.166
[knocking at door]

06:25.689 --> 06:26.603
Here's the thing.

06:26.690 --> 06:28.475
I am currently...

06:28.562 --> 06:29.650
how shall we say...

06:29.737 --> 06:30.433
sans residence?

06:33.044 --> 06:33.784
Homeless?
Uh-huh.

06:33.871 --> 06:35.395
I'm not homeless.

06:35.482 --> 06:37.962
I got a van.

06:38.049 --> 06:39.094
Is your registration
up to date?

06:39.181 --> 06:41.488
No.
You're homeless.

06:41.575 --> 06:43.403
Whatever.

06:43.490 --> 06:45.753
I was hoping I could
park her in the driveway.

06:45.840 --> 06:47.015
You know,
tap the power,

06:47.102 --> 06:49.104
use the facilities
for a few days.

06:49.191 --> 06:50.888
Let me think
about it... No.

06:50.975 --> 06:53.282
Aren't you gonna
run it past Christy?

06:53.369 --> 06:55.197
What do you want me
to say to her?

06:55.284 --> 06:56.590
Her deadbeat ex-husband wants
to park his van in her driveway

06:56.677 --> 06:58.069
and his ass
on her toilet?

07:00.332 --> 07:03.814
Well, I wouldn't
present it like that.

07:03.901 --> 07:04.859
Oh.

07:04.946 --> 07:06.077
What's going on?

07:06.164 --> 07:07.078
I was just explaining to Baxter

07:07.165 --> 07:08.253
that he can't live here.

07:08.340 --> 07:09.603
Not here.

07:09.690 --> 07:11.518
There.

07:11.605 --> 07:14.085
But with bathroom
privileges.

07:14.172 --> 07:16.000
I told him your life
was far too complicated

07:16.087 --> 07:17.262
to have to deal
with his drama.

07:17.349 --> 07:18.089
Thanks, Mom.

07:18.176 --> 07:19.569
You can stay.

07:21.919 --> 07:23.617
Thank you, Christy.

07:23.704 --> 07:25.793
Bonnie?
Pick one.

07:28.317 --> 07:30.493
Why would you let that loser
live in your driveway?

07:30.580 --> 07:32.626
I'd offer him the couch,

07:32.713 --> 07:34.889
but then you'd be homeless.

07:39.459 --> 07:41.461
[alarm beeping]

07:42.636 --> 07:44.551
Oh...

07:44.638 --> 07:46.857
[beeping stops]

07:46.944 --> 07:48.729
Oh, God, I hate being
a good mother.

07:50.774 --> 07:52.689
[grunts]

07:52.776 --> 07:56.258
Let's go,
Mom's making breakfast!

08:01.568 --> 08:03.265
"Dear Daughter,
I hope you slept well.

08:03.352 --> 08:04.614
"I thought you might like
to have a quiet Sunday morning

08:04.701 --> 08:06.660
so I took Roscoe
out for pancakes."

08:10.707 --> 08:12.666
Really pissing me off.

08:15.233 --> 08:16.191
[knocking at door]

08:16.278 --> 08:18.193
I got it.

08:19.455 --> 08:20.543
Ready to go?
Yep.

08:20.630 --> 08:22.545
I'll see you later.

08:22.632 --> 08:24.373
Wait.
What are you all dressed up for?

08:24.460 --> 08:25.983
We're going to
Luke's father's church.

08:26.070 --> 08:28.333
Not my idea.

08:28.420 --> 08:31.249
You mind driving?
I want to get high.

08:31.336 --> 08:32.511
I don't... I don't understand.

08:32.599 --> 08:33.817
It's your idea to go to church?

08:33.904 --> 08:35.210
Yeah, I'm curious.

08:35.297 --> 08:36.864
Oh, come on.

08:36.951 --> 08:38.953
I didn't raise you
to be curious.

08:39.039 --> 08:40.910
Relax, Mom.

08:40.998 --> 08:42.522
I'm not joining
some crazy cult.

08:42.609 --> 08:43.827
Oh, well...

08:47.352 --> 08:48.397
[sighs]

08:48.484 --> 08:49.572
No one is calling it a cult.

08:49.659 --> 08:50.747
I am just worried that...

08:50.834 --> 08:52.053
Mom.

08:52.140 --> 08:53.620
I know you're concerned.

08:53.707 --> 08:54.751
I know you love me,

08:54.838 --> 08:56.797
everything's gonna be fine.

08:58.973 --> 08:59.930
[whispering]:
Let's go.

09:04.935 --> 09:06.894
So pissed!

09:14.989 --> 09:16.947
BAXTER:
Hang on, I'm not decent!

09:21.299 --> 09:23.606
Oh, hey!

09:23.693 --> 09:26.130
I was, uh, I was gonna
make some coffee.

09:26.217 --> 09:27.436
Do you want some?

09:27.523 --> 09:28.785
No need, I just
made a fresh pot.

09:28.872 --> 09:30.395
Entrez vous.

09:31.745 --> 09:33.094
You have a coffeemaker?

09:33.181 --> 09:34.704
I got everything.

09:34.791 --> 09:37.489
Want a Belgian waffle?

09:37.577 --> 09:39.056
That's okay.

09:43.931 --> 09:46.455
Oh... [laughs]
Look.

09:46.542 --> 09:49.458
It's the beanbag chair
from our old apartment.

09:49.545 --> 09:51.591
Yep.

09:51.678 --> 09:53.462
Also got
the chandelier.

09:53.549 --> 09:55.507
Ah.

09:55.595 --> 09:57.553
That'll boost
the Blue Book value.

09:59.076 --> 10:01.035
The only sweetener
I have is stevia.

10:02.079 --> 10:04.516
Black is fine.

10:04.604 --> 10:06.127
Saw your mom this morning.

10:06.214 --> 10:08.042
She's around
a lot now, huh?

10:08.129 --> 10:09.783
Yeah, she's living with us.

10:09.870 --> 10:11.741
Since when?

10:11.828 --> 10:13.525
Since she lost
her apartment.

10:13.613 --> 10:18.356
Wow. So you're, like, running
a homeless shelter.

10:18.443 --> 10:20.358
Yeah.

10:20.445 --> 10:21.795
You two getting along better?

10:21.882 --> 10:23.100
Actually, we are, you know?

10:23.187 --> 10:25.320
She's been great
to have around.

10:25.407 --> 10:26.408
The kids love her.

10:26.495 --> 10:27.627
I got no complaints.

10:27.714 --> 10:28.715
Good for you.

10:28.802 --> 10:30.717
Yep.

10:30.804 --> 10:33.981
We're cruising along.

10:35.504 --> 10:37.811
Not a cloud in the sky.

10:37.898 --> 10:42.206
Well, I just want you to know
that I'm real appreciative

10:42.293 --> 10:45.427
of your help and I am not
here to complicate your life.

10:45.514 --> 10:45.775
Thank you.

11:05.055 --> 11:07.275
Somehow, I don't know why,

11:07.362 --> 11:09.973
my ex-husband thinks we're
getting back together again.

11:11.845 --> 11:13.063
I mean, yeah,
I slept with him...

11:13.150 --> 11:14.717
in his van...

11:14.804 --> 11:16.893
that he lives in...

11:16.980 --> 11:18.025
in my driveway.

11:18.112 --> 11:20.288
But still, let's not go crazy.

11:20.375 --> 11:22.551
I divorced him for a reason.

11:22.638 --> 11:25.597
[sighs] Anyway, the last few
days, I've had to park

11:25.685 --> 11:28.078
around the block and sneak into
my house through the back door

11:28.165 --> 11:32.648
so I won't have to look
into his sad puppy dog eyes.

11:32.735 --> 11:35.520
"Are we doing it tonight,
Christy? Are we?

11:35.607 --> 11:36.608
Are we?"

11:36.696 --> 11:37.697
Ugh!

11:40.612 --> 11:43.224
I guess that's it.

11:43.311 --> 11:44.965
Thanks for letting me share.
Anybody want

11:45.052 --> 11:47.576
to go out for coffee after
the meeting, let me know.

11:47.663 --> 11:48.969
I don't want to drive home
till he's asleep.

12:05.637 --> 12:08.989
Wait-- did I sneak
into the wrong house?

12:09.990 --> 12:11.992
[door opens]

12:12.079 --> 12:14.603
Oh, hey!
What do you think?

12:14.690 --> 12:17.954
I think you pimped my house.

12:18.041 --> 12:21.349
What happened here?

12:21.436 --> 12:23.264
I brought some of my stuff
from storage.

12:23.351 --> 12:24.961
Thought I'd zhush
the place up.

12:25.048 --> 12:27.703
Ah. Without discussing it
with me?

12:27.790 --> 12:29.226
Well, I wanted to surprise you.

12:29.313 --> 12:32.577
Okay, I'm surprised.

12:32.664 --> 12:33.840
Where's my stuff?

12:33.927 --> 12:35.276
Don't worry about it.

12:35.363 --> 12:36.843
Now come sit on
this couch and tell me

12:36.930 --> 12:38.540
it's not better than
what you had before.

12:38.627 --> 12:41.021
I don't care if it's better.
I want my furniture back!

12:41.108 --> 12:42.413
Well, you're not
even gonna try it?

12:42.500 --> 12:43.806
Mom, that's not the point.

12:43.893 --> 12:47.854
You can't just...
Oh, this is way better.

12:47.941 --> 12:49.116
Told ya. Now look.
Look at the kitchen table.

12:49.203 --> 12:51.379
It's got leaves.
We can widen it

12:51.466 --> 12:52.902
for when we have dinner parties.

12:52.989 --> 12:54.425
Since when do we have
dinner parties?

12:54.512 --> 12:56.340
Next Sunday.
I invited some people.

12:56.427 --> 12:58.125
You'll love them.

12:58.212 --> 13:01.084
I don't wanna love them!
I want your stuff out of here

13:01.171 --> 13:02.651
and I want my stuff
back right now!

13:02.738 --> 13:04.740
Okay, okay,
you don't have to get upset.

13:04.827 --> 13:08.004
You feed my children,
you take them to school,

13:08.091 --> 13:09.484
you play with them!

13:09.571 --> 13:11.399
And then you bring in
zhushy furniture,

13:11.486 --> 13:13.531
and you don't think I'm gonna
have a problem with that?!

13:14.837 --> 13:16.926
What is all
the yelling about?

13:17.013 --> 13:19.102
Your damn grandmother's
out of control!

13:20.843 --> 13:22.584
Leviticus, 20:9.

13:22.671 --> 13:24.891
"For anyone that curses
his mother shall surely

13:24.978 --> 13:25.021
be put to death."

13:26.283 --> 13:29.765
See what you did?

13:33.203 --> 13:35.945
[sighs]

13:36.032 --> 13:37.947
BAXTER:
Uno momento.

13:38.034 --> 13:39.993
[clattering]

13:44.345 --> 13:46.434
What's going on?

13:46.521 --> 13:48.784
I've lost my house.

13:48.871 --> 13:50.699
Been there.

13:50.786 --> 13:51.700
Come on in.

13:51.787 --> 13:53.789
Thanks.

13:55.878 --> 13:57.837
Just making
some hot cocoa.

13:57.924 --> 13:58.620
Want some?

13:58.707 --> 14:00.187
You have cocoa?

14:00.274 --> 14:01.101
You don't?

14:01.188 --> 14:03.190
No.

14:05.279 --> 14:09.413
So I was thinking, maybe
when you get a night off,

14:09.500 --> 14:11.894
I can take you out.

14:11.981 --> 14:13.940
Like a date?

14:14.027 --> 14:16.072
Why not? Just 'cause
I'm homeless and unemployed

14:16.159 --> 14:18.248
doesn't mean I can't take
a pretty girl out to dinner.

14:19.336 --> 14:22.339
It actually kind of does.

14:24.254 --> 14:29.477
Besides, I'm not sure
it's a good idea for us to date.

14:29.564 --> 14:32.219
Really?

14:32.306 --> 14:34.656
I thought the other night
when you and I...

14:34.743 --> 14:37.050
I know, I know,
and... I'm very sorry.

14:37.137 --> 14:39.879
I shouldn't
have done it.

14:39.966 --> 14:43.970
It's just, things have been
going so well lately.

14:46.015 --> 14:48.191
So, what, you mess it up
by sleeping with me?

14:50.324 --> 14:53.936
That's always wrecked
my life in the past.

14:56.939 --> 14:58.854
So how's your life going now?

14:58.941 --> 15:01.988
It's going great.

15:02.075 --> 15:04.642
Well, what are we going
to do about that?

15:32.583 --> 15:34.977
[sighs]

15:39.373 --> 15:43.029
Oh, no.

15:43.116 --> 15:45.074
[murmuring]

16:15.975 --> 16:17.977
Oh, come on.

16:21.850 --> 16:23.243
BONNIE [singsongy]:
Who is it?

16:28.248 --> 16:31.381
[door opens]

16:31.468 --> 16:33.383
Hey.

16:33.470 --> 16:37.300
Thanks for taking Roscoe
to school.

16:37.387 --> 16:39.563
No problem.

16:39.650 --> 16:42.175
Did he ask about me
and his father?

16:42.262 --> 16:43.306
He did.

16:43.393 --> 16:45.178
What'd you tell him?

16:45.265 --> 16:47.180
I told him, even though Mommy
and Daddy are divorced,

16:47.267 --> 16:49.356
they still enjoy hot monkey sex.

16:49.443 --> 16:51.227
Mom.

16:51.314 --> 16:52.707
What?
Kids love monkeys.

16:52.794 --> 16:53.795
Mom.

16:53.882 --> 16:55.318
I'm kidding,
I'm kidding.

16:55.405 --> 16:57.451
I told him that you and
Baxter were camping.

16:57.538 --> 16:59.061
He bought that?

16:59.148 --> 17:00.236
He's adorable,
but let's face it,

17:00.323 --> 17:02.195
we're looking at trade school.

17:02.282 --> 17:04.284
[sighs]

17:04.371 --> 17:06.199
What about Violet?

17:06.286 --> 17:08.853
Community college.

17:08.940 --> 17:09.984
No, I mean...

17:10.071 --> 17:11.769
I know, I know,
she's fine,

17:11.856 --> 17:14.032
she just thinks her mother's
a godless fornicator.

17:14.119 --> 17:16.773
I'm not godless.

17:19.167 --> 17:22.127
You know, I'm starting to think

17:22.214 --> 17:23.433
that I may have
some kind of a...

17:25.914 --> 17:27.915
...personality disorder.

17:28.960 --> 17:31.093
Oh, good, you know.

17:34.618 --> 17:38.318
I just think, I've lived
with chaos for so long,

17:38.405 --> 17:40.102
I don't know how
to live without it.

17:40.189 --> 17:41.625
Oh, I get that.

17:41.712 --> 17:44.193
Anyway, I'm sorry
for giving you a hard time.

17:44.280 --> 17:46.239
I know you're just
trying to help.

17:46.326 --> 17:49.111
Well, if it's okay with
you, I'm gonna keep trying.

17:49.198 --> 17:50.982
And I'm gonna try
to be more like you.

17:51.070 --> 17:52.680
No.
Yes, you've really

17:52.767 --> 17:53.681
turned your life around.

17:53.768 --> 17:54.986
No.
Yes.

17:55.074 --> 17:56.423
Don't think
I haven't noticed.

17:56.510 --> 17:57.554
Oh, thank you, baby.

17:57.641 --> 18:00.296
No, thank you.

18:00.383 --> 18:02.342
[siren wails]

18:05.258 --> 18:07.173
Oh, no,

18:07.260 --> 18:09.914
I wonder what
Baxter's done now.

18:10.001 --> 18:11.002
[door slams open]

18:25.539 --> 18:27.497
Morning.

18:34.287 --> 18:35.201
BAXTER:
Coming.

18:35.288 --> 18:37.246
[clattering]

18:38.987 --> 18:40.902
[sighs]

18:40.989 --> 18:43.818
Hey, neighbor, what's up?

18:43.905 --> 18:45.950
[sighs]
You won't believe it.

18:46.037 --> 18:47.256
I just spent the whole day

18:47.343 --> 18:49.258
trying to post
bail for my mom.

18:49.345 --> 18:50.477
Oh, man, sorry.

18:50.564 --> 18:54.655
Yeah, it's a freak show.

18:54.742 --> 18:57.788
I could really use
a little cocoa.

18:57.875 --> 18:59.007
Um...

18:59.094 --> 19:00.835
WOMAN:
Baxter, who is that?

19:03.446 --> 19:05.405
Just a second.

19:07.450 --> 19:09.539
Can you come back
around 10:00?

19:09.626 --> 19:12.325
You've got a woman in there?

19:12.412 --> 19:13.848
You said we weren't dating!

19:13.935 --> 19:15.850
I want you out of
my driveway now!

19:15.937 --> 19:17.591
Ooh, is somebody jealous?

19:17.678 --> 19:19.245
Oh.
Now.

19:19.332 --> 19:21.377
Okay, okay.

19:23.466 --> 19:24.598
We have to leave.

19:25.642 --> 19:28.297
Oh, come on!
