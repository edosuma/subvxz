25:30.500 --> 25:35.208
to ensure that I got
the right  start.

25:35.291 --> 25:37.625
And as I grew,

25:37.709 --> 25:41.875
he taught me to recognize
and seize opportunity.

25:41.959 --> 25:45.750
The value of loyalty
and alliances.

25:47.959 --> 25:49.667
The obligations of privilege.

25:51.542 --> 25:52.792
In essence,

25:52.875 --> 25:55.834

to the workings of the world.

25:57.542 --> 26:01.417
