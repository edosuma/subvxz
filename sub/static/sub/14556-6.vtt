00:01.169 --> 00:06.274
( train chugging )

00:10.811 --> 00:13.081
( train whistle blowing )

00:14.748 --> 00:16.450
( brakes screeching )

00:17.851 --> 00:19.753
( metal crunching )

00:24.392 --> 00:26.694
MAN: I handle the throttle and
the brakes.

00:26.727 --> 00:28.596
Jack watches the other systems.

00:30.731 --> 00:32.600
You drive a train with math.

00:32.633 --> 00:34.368
It's not like
driving a car.

00:34.402 --> 00:37.571
You can't just step on the gas
or hit the brakes.

00:39.340 --> 00:41.275
Got something up ahead.

00:41.309 --> 00:42.276
Vehicle on the track.

00:43.411 --> 00:44.478
( train horn honking )

00:44.512 --> 00:45.679
( brakes screeching )

00:47.448 --> 00:49.217
( siren whooping )

00:54.555 --> 00:56.257
DON:
What was the kid doing there?

00:56.290 --> 00:59.227
Homework assignment
on Dad's job.

00:59.260 --> 01:01.329
Day you take your kid to work,
you get in a wreck.

01:04.865 --> 01:06.500
( train horn honking )
Dad, what's going on?

01:06.534 --> 01:07.801
Jim, stay down
Grab on to something.

01:07.835 --> 01:09.403
Emergency brakes!

01:09.437 --> 01:10.504
( brakes screeching )
Damn it!

01:10.538 --> 01:11.839
The sander valve
must be plugged.

01:13.441 --> 01:14.608
What does the sander do?

01:14.642 --> 01:17.211
Well, it sprays sand on the
track to increase traction.

01:17.245 --> 01:18.879
That wouldn't have
stopped them in time.

01:18.912 --> 01:20.481
A train at that speed
has the kinetic energy

01:20.514 --> 01:21.482
of a small atomic weapon.

01:21.515 --> 01:22.583
Then why release the valve?

01:28.356 --> 01:30.391
He was thinking about the kids.

01:30.424 --> 01:32.526
Take over the controls. I'm
gonna open the valve by hand.

01:32.560 --> 01:33.494
But we're still gonna crash.

01:33.527 --> 01:35.763
The only chance those kids have.

01:35.796 --> 01:37.298
Brace your feet
against the wall.

01:37.331 --> 01:39.333
( kisses )
I'll be right back.

01:41.602 --> 01:43.504
( bell clanging )

01:43.537 --> 01:44.205
Hang on, Jimbo.

01:44.238 --> 01:45.105
Dad!

01:50.311 --> 01:52.546
( siren wails in distance )

02:01.189 --> 02:04.658
Jim, I'm very sorry
about your father.

02:04.692 --> 02:05.759
( sniffles )

02:05.793 --> 02:10.398
( weeping )

02:10.431 --> 02:12.466
Is it true no one
was on the bus?

02:16.537 --> 02:18.472
My husband died
trying to save children

02:18.506 --> 02:19.640
who weren't even there?

02:24.212 --> 02:28.416
Who leaves an empty school bus
on the railroad tracks?

02:28.449 --> 02:30.484
MAN:
Six wrecks in three years?

02:30.518 --> 02:32.520
All copies
of previous accidents.

02:32.553 --> 02:35.789
This one is based on a crash
in Utah, where seven kids died.

02:35.823 --> 02:38.492
He always leaves
one of these.

02:38.526 --> 02:39.793
All the notes
are the same.

02:39.827 --> 02:41.262
Just a series of numbers.

02:41.295 --> 02:43.163
Looks like a code.
( phone rings )

02:44.265 --> 02:45.233
This is Eppes.

02:45.266 --> 02:47.635
Okay. Put it through.

02:47.668 --> 02:49.370
This is Agent Eppes.

02:49.403 --> 02:50.838
MAN:
I want to speak to

02:50.871 --> 02:52.673
the agent in charge
of the train accident.

02:52.706 --> 02:54.708
You got him. Who's this?

02:54.742 --> 02:56.377
Do you have my note?

02:56.410 --> 02:58.712
Save yourself time and effort.

02:58.746 --> 03:00.814
Everything you need is
in that note.

03:00.848 --> 03:02.316
( call disconnects )

03:02.350 --> 03:04.318
Hung up?

03:04.352 --> 03:05.586
Male or female?

03:05.619 --> 03:07.488
Male.

03:08.989 --> 03:10.658
What have you
got from these?

03:10.691 --> 03:12.726
Well, our cryptographers
have gone over it.

03:12.760 --> 03:13.727
If it is a code,

03:13.761 --> 03:15.929
it's unbreakable.

03:15.963 --> 03:18.466
Wouldn't count on it.

03:21.535 --> 03:22.736
( train chugging )

03:25.339 --> 03:26.674
CHARLIE:
We all use math everyday.

03:26.707 --> 03:28.976
To predict weather.

03:29.009 --> 03:32.246
To tell time.

03:32.280 --> 03:34.782
To handle money.

03:34.815 --> 03:39.420
Math is more than formulas and
equasions.

03:39.453 --> 03:42.490
It's logic.

03:42.523 --> 03:44.725
It's rationality.

03:44.758 --> 03:48.529
It's using your mind to solve
the biggest mysteries we know.

03:55.336 --> 03:56.937
Our saboteur has
staged six attacks,

03:56.970 --> 03:59.973
all recreations
of previous accidents.

04:00.007 --> 04:02.643
This is a photo of the original
accident in New Jersey,

04:02.676 --> 04:04.011
caused by signal malfunction.

04:04.044 --> 04:05.946
He re-created it...

04:05.979 --> 04:07.648
right outside Fresno.

04:07.681 --> 04:09.483
This is the famous accident

04:09.517 --> 04:10.951
at the Cabot Bayou.

04:10.984 --> 04:12.386
Now, a barge hit the bridge,

04:12.420 --> 04:13.821
knocking tracks
out of alignment,

04:13.854 --> 04:16.056
and the warning system
failed to alert the train.

04:16.089 --> 04:18.992
Now, our saboteur,
he jimmies

04:19.026 --> 04:20.060
this track here in Seattle.

04:20.093 --> 04:24.332
Shorted out the warning system.
Eight people died.

04:24.365 --> 04:25.499
Every accident he's copied

04:25.533 --> 04:27.034
is based on incidents that
include railroad negligence?

04:27.067 --> 04:28.469
- That's right.
- DON: So someone

04:28.502 --> 04:29.637
has a problem
with the rail system.

04:29.670 --> 04:30.638
You're thinking

04:30.671 --> 04:31.505
a disgruntled railroad employee?

04:31.539 --> 04:33.607
TERRY:
Or a victim of a train wreck.

04:33.641 --> 04:34.908
I mean, whatever the motivation,

04:34.942 --> 04:35.976
I-I'm saying we're dealing

04:36.009 --> 04:37.077
with terrorism here.

04:37.110 --> 04:38.546
What do you make
of these, Terry?

04:38.579 --> 04:40.581
Every note he's left
is identical,

04:40.614 --> 04:42.450
which is a signature of sorts,

04:42.483 --> 04:44.352
his way of taking credit.
Now he's added phone calls,

04:44.385 --> 04:48.489
which means his need to explain
his actions is growing.

04:48.522 --> 04:49.757
So, what's he trying to tell us?

04:49.790 --> 04:51.058
( knocking )
Hey.

04:51.091 --> 04:52.993
Oh, good.

04:53.026 --> 04:54.027
Charlie, uh...

04:54.061 --> 04:54.995
This is my brother,
he's, uh,

04:55.028 --> 04:56.430
a consultant with the bureau

04:56.464 --> 04:58.999
This is Inspector Sutter,
with the NTSB,

04:59.032 --> 05:00.100
the National Transportation
Safety Board.

05:00.133 --> 05:02.069
This is, uh, Amita.

05:02.102 --> 05:03.003
Hi.

05:03.036 --> 05:03.871
You're a consultant as well?

05:03.904 --> 05:04.772
Uh, no. Charlie's
my thesis advisor,

05:04.805 --> 05:07.508
so sometimes I work
with him on school

05:07.541 --> 05:08.342
and consulting cases.

05:08.376 --> 05:09.510
Hey, can I take
a look at the code?

05:09.543 --> 05:10.310
Yeah.

05:10.344 --> 05:12.446
Why don't you
grab a seat here.

05:14.415 --> 05:16.083
So, uh, how long have
you studied cryptography?

05:16.116 --> 05:17.084
I haven't, really.

05:17.117 --> 05:18.852
I work in applied mathematics.

05:18.886 --> 05:21.422
DON: Wha-What we're dealing with
here

05:21.455 --> 05:23.524
is a saboteur who staged
a series of train wrecks

05:23.557 --> 05:24.925
that have two things in common.

05:24.958 --> 05:27.995
One: He leaves the same
note at every scene.

05:28.028 --> 05:29.730
Two: He's re-creating
accidents that are

05:29.763 --> 05:31.131
supposedly based
on railroad negligence.

05:31.164 --> 05:32.332
So you... Wait.

05:32.366 --> 05:35.369
You're saying that it's exactly
the same note every time?

05:35.403 --> 05:36.336
That's right.

05:36.370 --> 05:38.439
And he says everything
that we need to know

05:38.472 --> 05:39.440
is in the notes.

05:43.043 --> 05:44.645
( train engine roaring )

05:44.678 --> 05:45.779
Well...

05:45.813 --> 05:48.048
Just by looking at it,
I can tell you that this note

05:48.081 --> 05:49.850
begins and ends
with a prime number.

05:49.883 --> 05:51.919
Um...

05:51.952 --> 05:55.055
This row and this column
equal identical sums.

05:55.088 --> 05:57.691
The grouping of four
down here is the same

05:57.725 --> 06:00.528
as the grouping of four up here,
only backwards.

06:00.561 --> 06:02.129
And, uh...

06:02.162 --> 06:03.531
the only number repeated

06:03.564 --> 06:05.132
is 36,

06:05.165 --> 06:05.799
Yes, 36,

06:05.833 --> 06:06.934
one, two...

06:06.967 --> 06:08.736
It reoccurs three times.

06:08.769 --> 06:10.170
That's amazing.

06:10.203 --> 06:11.271
Well, what would be amazing is

06:11.304 --> 06:13.106
if I could tell you
why they're arranged that way.

06:13.140 --> 06:14.408
Wait a minute.

06:14.442 --> 06:16.444
Charlie, as in Charles Eppes?

06:16.477 --> 06:17.778
Yeah.

06:17.811 --> 06:19.580
I studied electrical engineering
at M.I.T.

06:19.613 --> 06:20.481
- Oh.
- Your paper on

06:20.514 --> 06:22.616
H-infinity control
of nonlinear systems

06:22.650 --> 06:24.585
blew my mind.

06:24.618 --> 06:26.119
I-It changed my whole
views on control theory.

06:26.153 --> 06:27.888
Well, yeah, that was
a fun project, sure.

06:27.921 --> 06:29.122
This is a real honor, you know?

06:29.156 --> 06:31.459
It took us four weeks
to even pick up

06:31.492 --> 06:32.760
the 36 repetition,

06:32.793 --> 06:34.995
but we think it's...
it's something important

06:35.028 --> 06:36.430
to the saboteur.

06:36.464 --> 06:37.798
Maybe 36 relates to the key?

06:37.831 --> 06:38.966
DAVID:
The key?

06:38.999 --> 06:39.767
Yeah, the key is, um,

06:39.800 --> 06:41.669
anything that will
unlock the code.

06:41.702 --> 06:43.136
Right, and it could be anything:

06:43.170 --> 06:45.573
a sentence, a word, a book.

06:45.606 --> 06:47.875
In fact a famous example
is in, uh, 1820.

06:47.908 --> 06:50.110
A man from Virginia
named Thomas Beale

06:50.143 --> 06:52.680
claimed to have hidden
$25 million in gold.

06:52.713 --> 06:53.914
The location of the treasure

06:53.947 --> 06:54.982
was hidden within
a coded message

06:55.015 --> 06:57.618
that really just looked like
a string of numbers.

06:57.651 --> 07:00.187
Now, he created that code
by using a key.

07:00.220 --> 07:03.724
And that key was the
Declaration of Independence.

07:03.757 --> 07:06.727
Three referred to the first
letter of the third word,

07:06.760 --> 07:08.862
Six to the first letter
of the sixth word,

07:08.896 --> 07:10.931
and so on.

07:10.964 --> 07:13.801
TERRY: So we need the key to
crack the code?

07:13.834 --> 07:16.637
Finding the key is one way
to attack the code,

07:16.670 --> 07:18.171
but there's actually

07:18.205 --> 07:20.140
a whole spectrum of mathematical
tools I can utilize.

07:20.173 --> 07:21.274
( phone rings )

07:21.308 --> 07:24.177
First, I can do a statistical
analysis of the numbers,

07:24.211 --> 07:27.681
then I can also work the cipher
text by using a Kasiski exam.

07:27.715 --> 07:29.182
Oh. Wouldn't Kasiski
be problematic

07:29.216 --> 07:30.283
due to the lack of spaces?

07:30.317 --> 07:32.119
Not if you consider multiple
grouping possibilities.

07:33.253 --> 07:34.187
A trainspotter's come forward.

07:34.221 --> 07:35.956
Claims to have video footage
of the crash.

07:35.989 --> 07:37.758
All right, well, let's get ahold
of that tape.

07:39.259 --> 07:40.427
( train whistle blowing )

07:40.460 --> 07:42.195
DAVID: As a trainspotter,
you videotape trains

07:42.229 --> 07:43.230
on a recreational basis?

07:43.263 --> 07:44.231
Yes,

07:44.264 --> 07:46.567
at that crossing, four
or five times a week.

07:46.600 --> 07:48.902
Catching those beauties
coming around the bend

07:48.936 --> 07:50.070
makes a man feel alive.

07:51.672 --> 07:53.541
Maybe you wanted
to get some footage

07:53.574 --> 07:55.175
that was even more exciting.

07:55.208 --> 07:57.811
You think I had something
to do with the derailment?

07:57.845 --> 07:58.879
No.

07:58.912 --> 08:00.914
I live to see trains

08:00.948 --> 08:02.883
running on the rails,
not off 'em.

08:02.916 --> 08:04.084
But I can't deny,

08:04.117 --> 08:06.687
catching an accident
like that on tape

08:06.720 --> 08:08.121
is pretty incredible.

08:09.957 --> 08:13.627
I could kill those guys
for running through my shot.

08:13.661 --> 08:15.128
What guys?

08:15.162 --> 08:19.700
Go ahead. Keep going.

08:19.733 --> 08:21.034
All right, stop.

08:21.068 --> 08:23.270
Right... Hold, stop there.

08:23.303 --> 08:25.172
DAVID: Good Samaritan trying to
help?

08:25.205 --> 08:26.674
Yeah, stealing cargo?

08:26.707 --> 08:27.941
I don't think so.

08:27.975 --> 08:29.176
Wind it back to where

08:29.209 --> 08:31.244
that first guy jumps
out of the van.

08:34.247 --> 08:36.784
Ho-ho-ho-hold, stop.

08:36.817 --> 08:37.985
To me, it looks like

08:38.018 --> 08:38.952
an acetylene torch,

08:38.986 --> 08:41.121
so we know they came
to cut into those cars.

08:41.154 --> 08:43.323
Yeah, they had to know
about the wreck in advance.

08:43.356 --> 08:45.325
Now push forward
to the license plate.

08:45.358 --> 08:47.761
Push forward where
they drive off.

08:51.298 --> 08:52.299
Okay, hold.

08:52.332 --> 08:53.266
Just zoom in on that.

08:54.635 --> 08:57.170
Got it. Trace that.

08:57.204 --> 08:59.339
So we got his identity
off the license.

08:59.372 --> 09:00.207
This is Matt McDonald.

09:00.240 --> 09:02.275
His van was used
in a pre-planned robbery

09:02.309 --> 09:03.343
of today's train wreck.

09:03.376 --> 09:04.912
We're gonna
set a perimeter

09:04.945 --> 09:06.246
around his house.
If he's home,

09:06.279 --> 09:07.247
we'll try
to lure him out alright.

09:07.280 --> 09:08.782
Nobody moves
unless I say.

09:08.816 --> 09:11.251
David get anything
on that threat call?

09:11.284 --> 09:12.352
They traced it
to a phone booth.

09:12.385 --> 09:13.286
They're checking
for fingerprints.

09:18.859 --> 09:20.160
Professor Fleinhardt!

09:22.129 --> 09:23.330
What are you doing?

09:23.363 --> 09:26.133
I just... Nothing in particular.

09:26.166 --> 09:27.567
I just wanted to see
what you're up to in here and...

09:30.403 --> 09:32.372
Some kind of number theory
conundrum?

09:32.405 --> 09:34.274
Perhaps I could offer
some insights.

09:34.307 --> 09:36.009
Well, first,
it's not number theory.

09:36.043 --> 09:37.845
It's a code.

09:37.878 --> 09:39.346
And second,

09:39.379 --> 09:40.614
you hate
number theory,

09:40.648 --> 09:41.682
so tell us
why you're here

09:41.715 --> 09:42.850
and what's really going on.

09:45.719 --> 09:49.690
I'm avoiding...

09:49.723 --> 09:51.324
Laura Wilson.

09:51.358 --> 09:53.260
The professor of Philosophy
of Science?

09:53.293 --> 09:54.662
She's the lady
you go hiking with?

09:54.695 --> 09:55.863
For years
we've enjoyed

09:55.896 --> 09:58.298
this... I don't know, um,
delightful

09:58.331 --> 10:01.268
wilderness-based friendship--

10:01.301 --> 10:02.803
entirely platonic--

10:02.836 --> 10:07.340
but last night,
she and I just veered...

10:07.374 --> 10:10.610
we veered off into
the... the carnal.

10:13.747 --> 10:16.316
I'm taking it didn't go well.

10:16.349 --> 10:19.119
Actually, it was incredible.

10:19.152 --> 10:20.387
It was primal.

10:20.420 --> 10:22.189
I mean that
in the animal,

10:22.222 --> 10:24.892
not the numerical sense.

10:24.925 --> 10:26.426
But what I was saying,

10:26.459 --> 10:28.929
this was a perfect event.

10:28.962 --> 10:30.664
And as such, untwinable.

10:30.698 --> 10:32.365
So, because the sex was great,

10:32.399 --> 10:34.301
the odds are against it
ever being great again.

10:34.334 --> 10:37.805
The replication
defies the laws of probability.

10:37.838 --> 10:38.972
So why try?

10:39.006 --> 10:39.973
Yes, yes.

10:40.007 --> 10:41.408
Well, that's why I'm here.

10:41.441 --> 10:43.243
I mean, it's the perfect refuge.

10:43.276 --> 10:44.912
What do you mean,
"the perfect refuge"?

10:44.945 --> 10:47.147
Well, the Math Department...

10:47.180 --> 10:49.382
must be the least libidinous
place on campus.

11:06.366 --> 11:09.770
It's definitely the same van
used in the robbery.

11:20.047 --> 11:22.750
( blipping )

11:22.783 --> 11:25.786
I've got one heat signature
emanating from the dining room.

11:25.819 --> 11:26.787
All right,
surveillance indicates

11:26.820 --> 11:28.421
our guy Matt McDonald
is alone in the house.

11:28.455 --> 11:30.758
Look, he's our only lead.

11:30.791 --> 11:32.059
I want to avoid
a confrontation,

11:32.092 --> 11:34.261
so what would you think
about going in,

11:34.294 --> 11:35.495
trying
to lure him out?

11:35.528 --> 11:37.497
Yeah, I could ring his doorbell,
say I'm having car trouble.

11:37.530 --> 11:39.767
Good. Let's set up
a perimeter around the house.

11:39.800 --> 11:41.268
Think McDonald's
our saboteur?

11:41.301 --> 11:42.135
Well, he's connected.

11:42.169 --> 11:43.971
We just got to get him
to tell us how.

11:44.004 --> 11:45.438
( buzzes )

11:46.539 --> 11:47.440
( buzzes )

11:49.376 --> 11:52.045
Come on. Answer the door.

11:54.181 --> 11:55.082
( buzzes )

11:58.518 --> 11:59.787
What's he doing?

12:02.890 --> 12:04.291
Wait a minute. What's wrong?

12:04.324 --> 12:05.893
Why's the temperature dropping?

12:05.926 --> 12:06.827
I just had it
recalibrated.

12:08.228 --> 12:09.196
All right, I'm going to go.

12:09.229 --> 12:10.330
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

12:10.363 --> 12:11.398
All units go.

12:16.503 --> 12:18.438
( yelling ):
Let's go!

12:21.541 --> 12:23.777
FBI! Get your hands up!

12:23.811 --> 12:25.512
I got an unresponsive male.

12:25.545 --> 12:28.281
I need four. Move!

12:39.259 --> 12:40.928
Dead.

12:45.933 --> 12:47.968
This guy's a railroad cop.

12:55.108 --> 12:57.010
DON:
No sign of forced entry.

12:57.044 --> 12:57.978
Stippling on the forehead

12:58.011 --> 13:00.113
so it looks like
he was shot at close range.

13:00.147 --> 13:02.149
The shooter was sitting
across from him.

13:02.182 --> 13:04.351
Met him at the door,
grabbed a cup of coffee,

13:04.384 --> 13:05.452
sat down at the table.

13:05.485 --> 13:06.854
DON:
Two cups of coffee.

13:06.887 --> 13:08.555
So, I'd say
they knew each other.

13:08.588 --> 13:11.158
David, uh, make sure
any prints or fibers

13:11.191 --> 13:13.193
that we get
are processed priority.

13:13.226 --> 13:14.194
Got it.

13:14.227 --> 13:17.164
TERRY: Looks like an electronics
store in here.

13:17.197 --> 13:18.365
DON:
I mean, no way

13:18.398 --> 13:20.300
he stole all this
off today's wreck.

13:20.333 --> 13:22.335
HARRILL: We checked the cargo
manifests

13:22.369 --> 13:23.871
from the previous attacks.

13:23.904 --> 13:26.106
The computers came
from the Fresno accident,

13:26.139 --> 13:28.041
plasma TVs from the crash
in Seattle.

13:28.075 --> 13:30.110
How many of the wrecks
did he hit?

13:30.143 --> 13:31.544
Four out of the six.

13:31.578 --> 13:34.281
The corrupt railroad cop
who was staging train wrecks

13:34.314 --> 13:35.849
just to rip off the cargo?

13:35.883 --> 13:37.117
Seems like a stretch
to me.

13:37.150 --> 13:38.151
I agree.

13:38.185 --> 13:40.053
I mean, obviously,
he knew about it in advance,

13:40.087 --> 13:41.588
but I just, I don't make him
for our guy.

13:41.621 --> 13:42.422
No, it doesn't make sense.

13:42.455 --> 13:43.723
It doesn't fit
with the re-creation

13:43.756 --> 13:46.159
( phone ringing ) of accidents
or the coded messages.

13:46.193 --> 13:47.294
Eppes.

13:47.327 --> 13:48.561
MAN:
Well done, finding your way

13:48.595 --> 13:49.562
to MacDonald's house.

13:49.596 --> 13:51.331
Too bad I beat you to the punch.

13:51.364 --> 13:53.433
TERRY:
Sweep the neighborhood.

13:53.466 --> 13:54.367
He may be watching
the house.

13:54.401 --> 13:56.937
I don't understand;
why'd you kill him?

13:56.970 --> 13:58.205
Wasn't he your partner?

13:58.238 --> 13:59.873
No. MacDonald was a thief
and a dirty cop.

13:59.907 --> 14:01.942
He used me to make some money.

14:01.975 --> 14:04.344
He didn't understand
what I was doing--

14:04.377 --> 14:05.345
the importance

14:05.378 --> 14:06.446
of exposing the railroads

14:06.479 --> 14:07.881
for the criminals they are.

14:07.915 --> 14:10.117
There are other ways, you know?

14:10.150 --> 14:11.118
( call disconnects )

14:11.151 --> 14:13.353
Hello?

14:13.386 --> 14:14.587
He just hung up.

14:14.621 --> 14:17.257
He implied he killed MacDonald.

14:17.290 --> 14:18.358
He's escalated
to hands-on violence.

14:18.391 --> 14:19.259
Right. So, that'll make it seem

14:19.292 --> 14:21.228
like he's gearing up
for something big.

14:21.261 --> 14:22.395
We got to find out
how he

14:22.429 --> 14:23.530
and MacDonald knew each other.

14:23.563 --> 14:24.664
We got to get into his files.

14:24.697 --> 14:26.066
Has anyone
come across his files?

14:28.368 --> 14:29.970
- Hello, Mr. Eppes.
- Oh, hi.

14:30.003 --> 14:30.971
Good to see you.

14:31.004 --> 14:32.239
Nice to see you again.

14:38.645 --> 14:40.047
ALAN:
Is that, uh, Amita

14:40.080 --> 14:41.982
sitting out in the car
out front?

14:42.015 --> 14:45.185
Yeah. We just stopped by
for a minute so I could check

14:45.218 --> 14:48.421
this text on encryption,
code-breaking...

14:48.455 --> 14:51.491
Uh, and you left her waiting
in the car?

14:56.496 --> 14:58.665
No, no, this is not the way
we treat people, Charlie.

14:58.698 --> 15:00.633
You bring her inside,
you at least offer her

15:00.667 --> 15:01.935
something to drink.

15:01.969 --> 15:03.036
You know, like an adult.

15:03.070 --> 15:05.438
We just stopped by for a second.

15:05.472 --> 15:07.207
You came in 15 minutes ago,
Charlie.

15:07.240 --> 15:10.110
Meanwhile,
she's just sitting

15:10.143 --> 15:10.978
in that car out there.

15:11.011 --> 15:13.080
Well, I just got caught
up in something.

15:13.113 --> 15:14.114
Yeah, I know, I know.

15:14.147 --> 15:15.648
I don't see what
the big deal is.

15:15.682 --> 15:17.484
That's exactly
what I'm talking about.

15:17.517 --> 15:18.585
What?

15:18.618 --> 15:21.989
She likes you, you know?

15:23.690 --> 15:25.358
Aren't you ever going
to do something

15:25.392 --> 15:27.027
about that?

15:30.397 --> 15:32.932
( sighing )

15:36.503 --> 15:38.138
CHARLIE:
Remember we need to know

15:38.171 --> 15:40.740
more about trains to find
the key to the saboteur's code.

15:40.773 --> 15:43.043
AMITA: So, you're familiar with
these accidents?

15:43.076 --> 15:45.478
Huh. The greatest hits
of train tragedies?

15:45.512 --> 15:46.479
Of course.

15:46.513 --> 15:48.982
What is this, some sort
of a research project?

15:49.016 --> 15:50.050
You could say that.

15:50.083 --> 15:51.184
What would be
a big help

15:51.218 --> 15:54.121
is if you could identify
any significant words or phrases

15:54.154 --> 15:55.522
associated
with these accidents.

15:55.555 --> 15:57.024
Wait, words or phrases?

15:57.057 --> 15:58.992
Anything specific
to the accident.

15:59.026 --> 16:00.560
The track location,
the cause,

16:00.593 --> 16:02.329
the people involved.

16:02.362 --> 16:03.997
Yeah, I guess I could do that.

16:04.031 --> 16:07.367
You know, you are missing
a major accident here--

16:07.400 --> 16:08.568
Cajon Pass, 2001.

16:08.601 --> 16:10.370
Train full
of hazardous chemicals

16:10.403 --> 16:12.405
derailed into a whole row
of houses.

16:12.439 --> 16:14.074
About 30 people died.

16:14.107 --> 16:15.542
Sounds like a bad one.

16:15.575 --> 16:17.544
Yeah. Well, you know, uh,

16:17.577 --> 16:20.647
accidents are kind of just a
small part of railroad history.

16:20.680 --> 16:22.715
Maybe you'd like to learn more
over dinner?

16:23.783 --> 16:26.619
Oh, uh, sorry, we'll be

16:26.653 --> 16:28.521
working tonight.

16:34.461 --> 16:36.063
You guys got
MacDonald's case files?

16:36.096 --> 16:38.031
Yeah. Apparently,
he was working undercover

16:38.065 --> 16:40.667
with a group called the FTRA--
Freight Train Riders of America.

16:42.269 --> 16:43.470
Yeah, I read about them.

16:43.503 --> 16:45.672
They're like the Hell's Angels
of the rails, or something.

16:45.705 --> 16:47.140
According to his notes,
the FTRA

16:47.174 --> 16:48.741
are into everything--
drugs, rape, murder.

16:48.775 --> 16:50.743
TERRY: And they live completely
off the grid.

16:50.777 --> 16:52.545
Commit a crime,
hop a train, vanish.

16:52.579 --> 16:54.114
So, it sounds like
a perfect place

16:54.147 --> 16:56.116
- for our guy to disappear into.
- Yeah, it could be

16:56.149 --> 16:57.684
where MacDonald met him
when he was undercover.

16:57.717 --> 16:58.685
Possible.

16:58.718 --> 16:59.686
Or maybe it'll be in these.

17:04.524 --> 17:06.226
This is interesting.

17:06.259 --> 17:07.327
Bob Malone,

17:07.360 --> 17:08.561
aka Horizontal Bob.

17:08.595 --> 17:11.764
Suspect in the derailment of
the Sunset Limited in Arizona.

17:11.798 --> 17:13.366
That's worth checking out.

17:13.400 --> 17:14.434
Let me see that.

17:14.467 --> 17:15.602
Says here he holes up

17:15.635 --> 17:17.604
in an Antelope Valley
freight warehouse.

17:17.637 --> 17:19.306
The first call
from our saboteur,

17:19.339 --> 17:22.075
that came from a pay phone
in Antelope Valley, right?

17:23.743 --> 17:26.313
Well, let's hit that warehouse.

17:26.346 --> 17:27.514
FBI!

17:27.547 --> 17:28.648
Nobody Move! FBI!

17:28.681 --> 17:29.649
- FBI! Don't move!
- You, get down!

17:29.682 --> 17:30.783
( yelling )

17:30.817 --> 17:32.085
Get down!

17:32.119 --> 17:33.086
Get your hands up!

17:33.120 --> 17:35.422
You! Get down! You!
( yelling )

17:35.455 --> 17:37.190
FBI! Don't move!

17:37.224 --> 17:38.791
Get your hands up
where I can see them!

17:38.825 --> 17:40.827
Get them up where I can
see them right now!

17:40.860 --> 17:42.529
- FBI!
- Get away from the box!

17:42.562 --> 17:43.663
Get away from the box now!

17:43.696 --> 17:44.631
FBI!

17:44.664 --> 17:45.632
Get 'em up!

17:45.665 --> 17:46.566
( screaming )

17:47.700 --> 17:48.835
Are you crazy?!

17:48.868 --> 17:50.170
FBI!

17:50.203 --> 17:51.538
TERRY:
Move back!

17:51.571 --> 17:53.440
Move back!
Move back!

17:53.473 --> 17:55.475
Okay. Don't move.

17:55.508 --> 17:56.676
You're not
moving, okay?

17:56.709 --> 18:00.613
Does anybody know where
Horizontal Bob is?!

18:00.647 --> 18:02.115
Gee, I just think
you missed him.

18:02.149 --> 18:03.516
How about you help us out

18:03.550 --> 18:05.752
and we don't bust you for
attacking a federal officer?

18:05.785 --> 18:09.322
Yeah, dime out an FTRA brother
to some government tool?

18:09.356 --> 18:10.657
Yeah, right.

18:10.690 --> 18:11.824
See, that's a bad answer.

18:11.858 --> 18:13.193
Get over here.

18:13.226 --> 18:15.862
Nobody's seen
Horizontal Bob here?

18:15.895 --> 18:17.664
Nobody knows who he is?

18:19.732 --> 18:21.301
No sign of
Horizontal Bob.

18:21.334 --> 18:23.803
None of these guys
are giving him up.

18:23.836 --> 18:25.238
Only takes one.

18:29.276 --> 18:31.244
( clanging )

18:31.278 --> 18:32.179
( thud )

18:36.883 --> 18:40.387
CRICKET: You got to understand
the rails are our homes,

18:40.420 --> 18:41.721
our churches, our highways.

18:41.754 --> 18:44.691
The FTRA don't mess
with the trains.

18:44.724 --> 18:47.860
So you don't think H-Bob
caused the wrecks?

18:47.894 --> 18:51.731
(laughs)
H-Bob, that's another story.

18:51.764 --> 18:52.532
Guy's a nut job.

18:52.565 --> 18:54.867
He got no respect
for the trains.

18:54.901 --> 18:59.272
He shoved me off a flatcar,
wrecked my arm.

18:59.306 --> 19:02.309
Well, if I find him, he's not
going to be hurting you again.

19:07.214 --> 19:10.450
You check
the Sacramento rail yard.

19:10.483 --> 19:12.552
I hear he was up that way.

19:13.920 --> 19:15.222
Let's call
the Sacramento office

19:15.255 --> 19:16.823
and get them staking out
that switchyard.

19:20.260 --> 19:23.296
Well, hopefully the key is
somewhere in the materials

19:23.330 --> 19:24.831
from the docent
in the train museum.

19:24.864 --> 19:25.732
Right next
to his phone number.

19:25.765 --> 19:28.835
( chuckles ):
Look at this.

19:28.868 --> 19:31.738
"If you ever decide
to eat again, call me."

19:31.771 --> 19:33.906
The docent.

19:33.940 --> 19:35.742
You think you...
you think you will?

19:35.775 --> 19:37.877
Eat? Yeah.

19:37.910 --> 19:39.812
Call him? No.

19:39.846 --> 19:42.315
He is not my type.

19:42.349 --> 19:43.883
I'm sorry, but
does that ever work?

19:43.916 --> 19:46.986
Just coming out
and being so... obvious?

19:47.019 --> 19:49.556
Well, if it's
the right guy, sure.

19:49.589 --> 19:51.691
Certainly beats
the alternative.

19:51.724 --> 19:54.361
Hmm. What do you mean?

19:54.394 --> 19:56.396
Having no idea
whether or not

19:56.429 --> 19:58.331
a man is
interested in you.

19:58.365 --> 20:00.900
You really can't tell?

20:00.933 --> 20:02.502
Generally, that
is how you tell.

20:02.535 --> 20:04.404
You know, they make
a move. Otherwise...

20:04.437 --> 20:05.605
Larry?

20:05.638 --> 20:07.807
Are you all right?

20:09.376 --> 20:13.613
Laurel Wilson cornered me.

20:13.646 --> 20:15.615
So I explained to her.

20:15.648 --> 20:17.950
I said,
"Statistically speaking..."

20:17.984 --> 20:19.786
statistically speaking,

20:19.819 --> 20:23.923
"...our encounter, unlikely
to be repeated."

20:23.956 --> 20:27.394
So, she declared that
I had broken her heart.

20:27.427 --> 20:31.964
You know, believe me, I never
intended to upset her.

20:31.998 --> 20:34.767
I know. You seem pretty upset
yourself.

20:34.801 --> 20:35.868
Well, yeah.

20:35.902 --> 20:37.904
She's a dear friend.

20:37.937 --> 20:44.944
Witty and articulate
and... tremendous trail sense.

20:44.977 --> 20:45.778
I don't know.

20:45.812 --> 20:48.315
Combining friendship
and romance--

20:48.348 --> 20:50.016
exceedingly risky.

20:50.049 --> 20:54.387
The Cajon Pass accident
killed 37 people.

20:54.421 --> 20:56.289
The number in
every note is 36.

20:56.323 --> 20:57.524
Fairly close.

20:57.557 --> 20:59.859
How so?
37 is a prime.

20:59.892 --> 21:02.829
36 is a composite
with multiple factors.

21:02.862 --> 21:05.865
Right. What
was I thinking?

21:05.898 --> 21:07.334
Still...

21:07.367 --> 21:09.669
this Cajon accident
is unbelievable.

21:09.702 --> 21:15.408
5,237 tons of steel flying off
the track at 90 miles an hour.

21:15.442 --> 21:18.010
Did you just say five,
two, three, seven?

21:18.044 --> 21:20.880
Yeah, 5,237 tons.

21:20.913 --> 21:23.049
How fast?

21:23.082 --> 21:24.784
About 90 miles an hour.

21:26.986 --> 21:28.755
Where did you get
this information?

21:28.788 --> 21:31.791
I downloaded
the NTSB report.

21:31.824 --> 21:32.892
Read me some more.

21:32.925 --> 21:34.594
"While the NTSB encountered..."

21:34.627 --> 21:36.028
No, the numbers.

21:36.062 --> 21:36.929
Just numbers.

21:36.963 --> 21:38.531
Locomotive number

21:38.565 --> 21:39.832
4-4-0-4.

21:41.868 --> 21:45.104
Train length: 3,218 feet.

21:45.137 --> 21:49.409
The grade of pass: 4.2 percent.

21:49.442 --> 21:54.347
Brake pipe pressure: 60 pounds.

21:54.381 --> 21:55.515
14 miles an hour,

21:55.548 --> 21:57.950
increasing five miles an hour
each minute.

21:57.984 --> 21:59.752
Despite application of brakes,

21:59.786 --> 22:02.389
train reaches speed
of 90 miles an hour.

22:02.422 --> 22:05.057
Train derails at milepost 64.

22:05.091 --> 22:07.727
Time of the accident: 4:10 a.m.

22:09.729 --> 22:13.733
Every single one of those
numbers appears in these notes.

22:13.766 --> 22:15.902
So the Cajon Pass derailment
is the key to the code?

22:15.935 --> 22:16.969
The key is that
there is no key.

22:17.003 --> 22:20.407
The numbers don't represent
words... or letters.

22:20.440 --> 22:22.442
They're numbers,
all from this accident.

22:22.475 --> 22:25.478
It's not a code.

22:25.512 --> 22:27.914
It's a story told in numbers.

22:27.947 --> 22:30.417
Each time he creates
an accident,

22:30.450 --> 22:31.784
he leaves a note.

22:31.818 --> 22:33.786
And each note
has the same numbers.

22:33.820 --> 22:35.722
And those numbers
tell the story

22:35.755 --> 22:38.691
of the Cajon Pass derailment.

22:39.826 --> 22:43.095
Charlie, it happened
on March 12, 2001.

22:43.129 --> 22:46.098
That accounts for
eight more digits

22:46.132 --> 22:47.934
that appear
in these notes.

22:47.967 --> 22:49.636
The anniversary of the accident.

22:49.669 --> 22:51.971
Two days from now.

22:52.004 --> 22:53.906
( train whistle blowing )

23:04.851 --> 23:07.854
CHARLIE: Every number in these
notes corresponds

23:07.887 --> 23:09.556
to the NTSB report
on the derailment.

23:09.589 --> 23:10.857
The length
of the train,

23:10.890 --> 23:12.825
speed, number of cars...
It's all in the messages.

23:12.859 --> 23:13.826
DON:
Any connection

23:13.860 --> 23:15.094
between H-Bob and the Cajon Pass
accident, Terry?

23:15.127 --> 23:16.095
I'll check.

23:16.128 --> 23:17.063
Anything from
Sacramento?

23:17.096 --> 23:19.432
They have agents all
over that switchyard.

23:19.466 --> 23:21.133
There's no sign of him at all.

23:21.167 --> 23:23.202
There are still a few
digits unaccounted for.

23:23.235 --> 23:26.606
AMITA: These seven numbers,
the letter "B" and 36.

23:29.108 --> 23:31.511
What caused
the Cajon Pass accident?

23:31.544 --> 23:33.546
I think the NTSB report
said that the engineer

23:33.580 --> 23:34.881
forgot to check
the end-of-train brake system.

23:34.914 --> 23:36.115
I'm sorry,

23:36.148 --> 23:38.117
I've just been over
the report-- a lot.

23:38.150 --> 23:40.520
I'm glad someone
reads our work.

23:40.553 --> 23:42.922
Well, 37 people died--
that's close to the 36

23:42.955 --> 23:45.558
in the notes.
No?

23:45.592 --> 23:47.059
Seven numbers
and a letter.

23:47.093 --> 23:49.228
I don't see anything linking
H-Bob to the Cajon Pass.

23:49.261 --> 23:51.230
DAVID: Maybe the link is
indirect.

23:51.263 --> 23:54.701
Wait a minute.

23:54.734 --> 23:56.536
California Driver's license--
a letter

23:56.569 --> 23:57.203
and seven
numbers.

23:57.236 --> 23:58.505
See if you can

23:58.538 --> 23:59.972
generate a list
of licenses using

24:00.006 --> 24:01.240
all seven numbers
and then check it

24:01.273 --> 24:02.241
against
the NTSB files.

24:02.274 --> 24:03.810
Right?

24:03.843 --> 24:04.711
Right.

24:06.613 --> 24:08.581
The license belongs
to Frank Milton,

24:08.615 --> 24:10.583
the Cajon train engineer.

24:10.617 --> 24:12.485
He died in the crash.

24:12.519 --> 24:13.586
Milton was deemed responsible
for the accident.

24:15.021 --> 24:17.524
Why would the saboteur
leave a copy

24:17.557 --> 24:19.592
of Frank Milton's driver's
license in his note?

24:19.626 --> 24:21.494
Why bring attention to Milton?

24:21.528 --> 24:23.229
Well, look, he's the engineer
during the Cajon Pass accident.

24:23.262 --> 24:24.463
The railroad blames him.

24:24.497 --> 24:27.266
If he thinks they're trying
to cover up their mistakes...

24:27.299 --> 24:29.135
He thinks Frank
Milton's a martyr.

24:29.168 --> 24:31.103
Well, let's see
what the widow says.

24:33.072 --> 24:34.641
My husband did not forget

24:34.674 --> 24:36.609
to turn on his
end-of-train brake.

24:38.611 --> 24:41.080
The railroad lied
to the NTSB.

24:41.113 --> 24:42.582
How can you be sure?

24:42.615 --> 24:45.718
He was the most meticulous
engineer on the line.

24:45.752 --> 24:49.922
His crews used to call him
"Four-check Frank,"

24:49.956 --> 24:51.758
'cause of the way he'd
go over the equipment.

24:51.791 --> 24:53.192
Well, so what do you think
happened to the brake?

24:53.225 --> 24:54.727
Damn thing
was always breaking down.

24:54.761 --> 24:56.696
The railroad

24:56.729 --> 24:58.531
covered up the service records.

24:58.565 --> 25:00.099
- Oh, yeah?
- Yes.

25:01.734 --> 25:04.036
Let me ask
you something.

25:04.070 --> 25:05.572
You ever seen this man?

25:05.605 --> 25:07.139
Goes by the name
Horizontal Bob.

25:07.173 --> 25:08.274
Never seen him

25:08.307 --> 25:09.642
in my life.

25:09.676 --> 25:10.710
Worst thing is,

25:10.743 --> 25:13.680
those corporate bastards
keep trying to buy me off.

25:13.713 --> 25:16.949
Every few months,
I get cash in the mail.

25:16.983 --> 25:19.185
Guilt money.

25:19.218 --> 25:21.688
Don.

25:21.721 --> 25:23.255
Yeah, can you excuse us, please?

25:25.324 --> 25:27.627
Frank Milton was meticulous
and detail-oriented

25:27.660 --> 25:29.696
and wrongly accused of
causing a terrible tragedy.

25:29.729 --> 25:31.030
He's supposed to be dead.

25:31.063 --> 25:32.331
Someone's sending
the widow money.

25:32.364 --> 25:33.633
It's not the railroad.

25:33.666 --> 25:34.567
Hmm-mm.

25:39.772 --> 25:41.774
Is this your husband?

25:41.808 --> 25:42.609
Yes.

25:42.642 --> 25:43.710
That's from our wedding.

25:44.944 --> 25:47.614
DON:
So, Frank Milton didn't die

25:47.647 --> 25:49.215
in the Cajon pass
accident.

25:49.248 --> 25:51.250
He is alive. He didn't
want to be blamed.

25:51.283 --> 25:52.819
Instead of facing
accusations,

25:52.852 --> 25:53.953
he drops out, right?

25:53.986 --> 25:55.722
He goes underground
with the FTRA.

25:55.755 --> 25:57.323
So what about
Horizontal Bob?

25:57.356 --> 25:59.826
Well, he fingers him
to throw us off, right?

25:59.859 --> 26:01.694
Mm-hmm. What he's doing,
he's trying to wreck

26:01.728 --> 26:03.095
public confidence
in the rail system.

26:03.129 --> 26:04.130
( phone ringing )
Hey.

26:04.163 --> 26:04.964
Eppes.

26:04.997 --> 26:06.633
The clock is ticking,
Agent Eppes.

26:06.666 --> 26:09.101
You're nowhere near catching me.

26:09.135 --> 26:10.770
90 seconds to trace the
call. I need a trace.

26:10.803 --> 26:12.639
Well, I'd say
I'm pretty darn close, Frank.

26:12.672 --> 26:13.773
I know H-Bob didn't throw you

26:13.806 --> 26:15.174
off that train,
I know you jumped

26:15.207 --> 26:16.175
just before
the Cajon Pass.

26:16.208 --> 26:17.777
That's how you
hurt your arm.

26:17.810 --> 26:18.778
You're smarter

26:18.811 --> 26:20.079
than the NTSB.

26:20.112 --> 26:21.948
Yeah, I also know
you're not responsible

26:21.981 --> 26:23.683
for that first accident, Frank.

26:23.716 --> 26:24.984
Well, the railroad said I was.

26:25.017 --> 26:27.787
The brake lines failed--
I told them

26:27.820 --> 26:29.789
the maintenance was shoddy.

26:29.822 --> 26:31.257
They didn't care.

26:31.290 --> 26:32.992
And 36 people died.

26:33.025 --> 26:34.260
Look, let me ask you this.

26:34.293 --> 26:36.663
Do you know how much
your wife misses you?

26:36.696 --> 26:39.699
You talked to my wife?

26:39.732 --> 26:42.935
Yup, and believes in you.

26:42.969 --> 26:44.203
You want
to see her again, Frank?

26:44.236 --> 26:45.705
The only way
that's going to happen

26:45.738 --> 26:46.706
is if you turn yourself in.

26:46.739 --> 26:50.677
No, people need to know
the rails aren't safe.

26:50.710 --> 26:52.178
We can do that.

26:52.211 --> 26:54.947
Look, we can set the record
straight, you and me, okay?

26:54.981 --> 26:57.650
The railroad
buries its mistakes!

26:57.684 --> 26:59.752
Everyone knows it'll cost
billions to make the rails safe.

26:59.786 --> 27:01.253
They won't spend the money.

27:01.287 --> 27:04.757
It's going to take something
big to force a change.

27:04.791 --> 27:05.925
Well, this is what I know.

27:05.958 --> 27:08.127
Tomorrow is the anniversary
of the Cajon Pass accident

27:08.160 --> 27:10.763
and I think you're going to
try and re-create it, Frank.

27:10.797 --> 27:12.899
And I'm here to tell you
it's not going to happen.

27:12.932 --> 27:14.734
There is no way
you'll pull that off.

27:14.767 --> 27:18.037
Agent Eppes, there are
a lot of trains out there.

27:18.070 --> 27:20.339
You can't protect all of them.

27:20.372 --> 27:23.743
But even if it doesn't happen
tomorrow, it will another day.

27:23.776 --> 27:26.746
I have all the time
in the world.

27:26.779 --> 27:31.150
But when I'm done, the railroad
companies will be in ruins.

27:31.183 --> 27:32.885
All right, Frank? Frank?
( call disconnects )

27:32.919 --> 27:34.687
The call originated
from inside

27:34.721 --> 27:36.989
the control room of the
San Bernardino switchyard.

27:37.023 --> 27:38.324
- What?
- Yeah.

27:38.357 --> 27:39.125
I got them.

27:41.193 --> 27:43.295
I want to know
how he got in here?

27:43.329 --> 27:45.164
People saw a man in
a janitor's uniform,

27:45.197 --> 27:46.065
no one thought
twice.

27:46.098 --> 27:46.999
But from in here,

27:47.033 --> 27:48.835
he can tamper with
any number of switches

27:48.868 --> 27:50.002
and controls,
cause hundreds of accidents.

27:50.036 --> 27:52.071
And did he?

27:52.104 --> 27:54.240
As far as we can tell,
he didn't touch a thing,

27:54.273 --> 27:56.709
except for this.

27:56.743 --> 27:58.778
He's showing us
what he's capable of.

27:58.811 --> 28:00.246
All right, well,
now it's our turn.

28:00.279 --> 28:01.447
Why don't you guys

28:01.480 --> 28:02.448
look around here.

28:02.481 --> 28:03.783
Show me how this thing works.

28:06.518 --> 28:08.955
This is Frank Milton.

28:08.988 --> 28:11.490
We believe tomorrow he
will attempt to attack one

28:11.523 --> 28:13.325
of 100 trains traveling
over the Cajon Pass.

28:13.359 --> 28:14.727
DAVID: We can't get the pass
closed

28:14.761 --> 28:16.228
because we don't have
a specific threat.

28:16.262 --> 28:18.464
All we have are our conclusions
about Milton's plans.

28:18.497 --> 28:20.499
Yeah, it's the major freight
rail line into L.A..

28:20.532 --> 28:21.734
Closing it would shut down

28:21.768 --> 28:23.269
60% of the region's
commerce.

28:23.302 --> 28:24.403
DON:
The kicker is,

28:24.436 --> 28:25.371
the guy's off the grid.

28:25.404 --> 28:27.373
Hunting him down
could take months or years.

28:27.406 --> 28:29.041
Our best shot
is at that Pass.

28:29.075 --> 28:29.976
CHARLIE:
Terry believes Milton

28:30.009 --> 28:31.243
will select a train most like

28:31.277 --> 28:32.378
the one he drove.

28:32.411 --> 28:33.379
I'll rank
tomorrow's trains according

28:33.412 --> 28:35.782
to similarities to the original;
that way we can

28:35.815 --> 28:36.983
focus the searches.

28:37.016 --> 28:38.918
Right, and I'll be in the yard,
coordinating the searches.

28:38.951 --> 28:40.820
TERRY: Crews will check their
end-of-train equipment

28:40.853 --> 28:42.822
and the entire brake system
before heading down the pass.

28:42.855 --> 28:44.824
DON: Local cops will be walking
the tracks,

28:44.857 --> 28:45.925
checking for any tampering.

28:45.958 --> 28:47.794
I want cops posted anywhere

28:47.827 --> 28:49.328
that train slows down
in case he tries

28:49.361 --> 28:50.763
to jump on one after the yard.

28:50.797 --> 28:51.898
What about rail cops?

28:51.931 --> 28:53.065
DAVID:
They've posted the photos

28:53.099 --> 28:54.967
around the yard
and tightened the perimeter.

28:55.001 --> 28:56.869
DON: There'll be an armed agent
or cop on every train

28:56.903 --> 28:58.404
just in case
he happens to get on one.

28:58.437 --> 28:59.972
You think Milton will try
to sabotage a train

29:00.006 --> 29:00.973
with all this security?

29:01.007 --> 29:02.074
Yeah, I do,

29:02.108 --> 29:03.843
I think he's gonna attempt it,

29:03.876 --> 29:05.744
but we're gonna
be ready for him.

29:08.547 --> 29:10.149
Hey, ready to go?

29:10.182 --> 29:12.318
Not quite.
Mrs. Milton is here.

29:12.351 --> 29:15.754
Oh. All right.

29:17.323 --> 29:18.858
Mrs. Milton.

29:18.891 --> 29:20.893
- Agent Eppes.
- Yes, ma'am.

29:20.927 --> 29:22.795
Frank called me.

29:22.829 --> 29:25.131
I couldn't
believe it.

29:25.164 --> 29:27.800
To hear his voice
after four years.

29:27.834 --> 29:30.136
What did he say?

29:30.169 --> 29:34.040
He begged me to forgive him,
and then he told me...

29:34.073 --> 29:37.910
Please, Mrs. Milton,
this is very important.

29:37.944 --> 29:40.179
Time is of
the essence now.

29:40.212 --> 29:42.348
He told me good-bye.

29:42.381 --> 29:45.384
On the Cajon Pass
that day, apparently he...

29:45.417 --> 29:48.554
jumped before the wreck.

29:48.587 --> 29:51.557
Engineers aren't
supposed to do that.

29:51.590 --> 29:53.492
As much as he hates
the railroad,

29:53.525 --> 29:55.161
he hates himself worse.

29:55.194 --> 29:57.363
He's going to
kill himself.

29:57.396 --> 29:58.965
Is that what
you think?

29:58.998 --> 30:00.399
Is that what
he was saying?

30:00.432 --> 30:01.901
He's going to
kill himself?

30:19.418 --> 30:21.053
( whistle blowing )

30:29.996 --> 30:31.463
DON:
All right, so we all set?

30:31.497 --> 30:33.065
I've compiled data
on every train car

30:33.099 --> 30:34.033
leaving the
switchyard today.

30:34.066 --> 30:35.134
All that's left

30:35.167 --> 30:37.203
is to compare those elements
to the original train

30:37.236 --> 30:38.905
in order to find
the closest match.

30:38.938 --> 30:40.940
Did you use a computer
program for the comparison?

30:40.973 --> 30:42.942
You know what, there
wasn't time to write one,

30:42.975 --> 30:44.010
but I can
handle that.

30:44.043 --> 30:46.012
You'll have to review
over 100,000 data points.

30:46.045 --> 30:47.113
Well, we're going
to concentrate

30:47.146 --> 30:48.447
on the trains
that Charlie flagged.

30:48.480 --> 30:50.582
See you later.

30:50.616 --> 30:53.585
SUTTER: The yard supervisor says
that a train leaves

30:53.619 --> 30:54.586
every six minutes.

30:54.620 --> 30:56.989
A lot carry munitions
or hazardous chemicals.

30:57.023 --> 30:58.390
All right,
let's get the database up.

30:58.424 --> 31:00.626
I've got to find
the trains most like the one

31:00.659 --> 31:02.461
that derailed
four years ago.

31:02.494 --> 31:04.096
So how does
this work?

31:04.130 --> 31:05.898
These specs are from
the original El Cajon

31:05.932 --> 31:07.566
locomotive and
container cars.

31:07.599 --> 31:10.036
This database shows
today's trains,

31:10.069 --> 31:13.072
sorted by departure time
and their relevant specs--

31:13.105 --> 31:16.142
number of cars, gear ratio,

31:16.175 --> 31:19.011
engine model, HP traction...

31:19.045 --> 31:19.946
( clang )

31:23.049 --> 31:24.951
( train chugging )

31:29.188 --> 31:30.256
MAN:
All right.

31:32.624 --> 31:34.460
All right,
give me the first group.

31:34.493 --> 31:35.461
Train HB-17

31:35.494 --> 31:36.963
and PL-02.

31:36.996 --> 31:38.931
Track 32

31:38.965 --> 31:40.066
and 2 respectively.

31:40.099 --> 31:41.300
Right, 32.

31:41.333 --> 31:43.069
Track 2 train

31:43.102 --> 31:44.170
contains some cars
of Naval munitions.

31:44.203 --> 31:45.604
Well, that sounds like

31:45.637 --> 31:47.073
an ideal target--
why don't you take that.

31:47.106 --> 31:48.975
Okay, let's go.

31:49.008 --> 31:50.209
All right, ride-along
assignments--

31:50.242 --> 31:51.978
Ortiz, you're on CC-3.

31:52.011 --> 31:54.580
Varitek, IS-22. Mulligan,

31:54.613 --> 31:56.015
HM-04. And hustle!

31:56.048 --> 31:57.016
It leaves on Track 20

31:57.049 --> 31:58.484
in eight minutes.

31:58.517 --> 32:00.219
All right, give me
the next train, Charlie.

32:05.157 --> 32:09.061
( train chugging )

32:12.298 --> 32:14.100
CHARLIE:
That one.

32:14.133 --> 32:16.002
PSP-31,

32:16.035 --> 32:17.970
- track 24.
- Hey, actually, Don,

32:18.004 --> 32:19.205
you know, wait,
go, um...

32:19.238 --> 32:21.140
go to HM-04.

32:21.173 --> 32:23.075
It's nearly identical
to the original.

32:23.109 --> 32:25.477
It's got several cars
of nuclear waste.

32:25.511 --> 32:27.046
Track 20.

32:27.079 --> 32:29.115
Train number HM-04.

33:15.627 --> 33:17.229
He shoved me off a flatcar,
wrecked my arm.

33:20.732 --> 33:22.168
Frank, it's over!

33:22.201 --> 33:23.102
Don't move!
Don't do it, Frank!

33:23.135 --> 33:25.104
- Frank! Frank!
- Easy, easy! Don't shoot!

33:27.073 --> 33:29.441
You'll blow up the whole yard.

33:29.475 --> 33:30.442
Shoot me,
and there'll be

33:30.476 --> 33:31.710
a radioactive cloud

33:31.743 --> 33:33.279
hanging over the L.A. basin

33:33.312 --> 33:34.380
for a week.

33:34.413 --> 33:35.547
Just put that down

33:35.581 --> 33:36.782
and go down to the ground.

33:36.815 --> 33:39.085
Put your knees
on the ground, Frank.

33:39.118 --> 33:40.152
Don, are you at Track 20?

33:41.320 --> 33:43.155
Don?

33:43.189 --> 33:45.291
Frank, hold it. Listen to me.
Just listen to me.

33:45.324 --> 33:47.826
I know you want to settle
your score with the railroad.

33:47.859 --> 33:49.528
The best way to do that
is to stay alive, Frank...

33:49.561 --> 33:52.064
I'll tell my story
when I hop on that train,

33:52.098 --> 33:54.166
ride it down the pass
and blow it up.

33:54.200 --> 33:55.467
Then everyone
will wonder why,

33:55.501 --> 33:57.403
and you're going
to tell them why.

33:57.436 --> 33:58.837
because you have
the responsibility...

33:58.870 --> 34:01.340
Charlie, tell the supervisor
to move that HM-04 now.

34:01.373 --> 34:03.375
We've got an explosive device
on Track 20.

34:03.409 --> 34:05.777
I sent Don to Track 20.

34:07.113 --> 34:07.846
( train whistle blowing )

34:07.879 --> 34:09.548
Frank if you set
that off, you're

34:09.581 --> 34:11.817
the bad guy in this scenario--
is that what you want?

34:11.850 --> 34:13.185
You want to die
for no reason?

34:13.219 --> 34:14.720
Is that what you want, Frank?

34:14.753 --> 34:17.055
I should've died years ago,
with everybody else.

34:20.426 --> 34:22.194
FRANK:
Ow!

34:22.228 --> 34:23.329
TERRY:
Don, you okay?

34:23.362 --> 34:25.331
No, bomb!
There's a timer running!

34:25.364 --> 34:27.233
It's over, Agent Eppes.

34:27.266 --> 34:29.135
Get train HM-04 out of the yard.

34:29.168 --> 34:30.202
Terry, get out of here.

34:30.236 --> 34:30.702
They'll never get the train
out of here in time.

34:30.736 --> 34:31.703
I said fall back!

34:31.737 --> 34:34.606
You can't hold him
and work the bomb. I stay!

34:34.640 --> 34:36.142
Don't move!
( grunting )

34:36.175 --> 34:37.243
All right, all right.

34:37.276 --> 34:38.777
Let's get it off him. All right.

34:38.810 --> 34:41.347
- Let's get it off him.
- DAVID: Don, don't!

34:41.380 --> 34:42.181
Don't touch that.

34:42.214 --> 34:43.249
David, get out of here.

34:43.282 --> 34:44.750
There might be a trip wire.

34:44.783 --> 34:46.352
There might be a trip wire!

34:46.385 --> 34:48.154
TERRY: Don't move! Ow! Ah!

34:48.187 --> 34:51.523
Hold him! There might be a trip
wire between him and the device.

34:51.557 --> 34:52.691
What are you gonna do?

34:52.724 --> 34:53.625
I got it.

34:53.659 --> 34:54.893
Are you sure you know
what you're doing?

34:54.926 --> 34:57.796
I know what I'm
doing. I got it.

34:57.829 --> 34:59.265
You just hold him.

34:59.298 --> 34:59.998
I got him.

35:00.031 --> 35:01.867
( high-pitched tone )

35:01.900 --> 35:02.401
Just hold him still.

35:02.434 --> 35:03.435
Don't let him move.

35:03.469 --> 35:05.204
( tone stops )
( grunts )

35:05.237 --> 35:06.272
( gasps )

35:10.209 --> 35:12.378
All right, get him up.

35:15.281 --> 35:16.382
How'd you learn how to do that?

35:16.415 --> 35:18.817
Don't tell me, you took a class
at the academy, right?

35:18.850 --> 35:21.487
First posting was
in Tel Aviv.

35:21.520 --> 35:23.289
Got my bomb training.

35:23.322 --> 35:27.759
Guys, for following orders,
not your best moment,

35:27.793 --> 35:29.361
but thank you.

35:29.395 --> 35:30.929
It's all right,
we got him.

35:30.962 --> 35:32.298
It's okay,

35:32.331 --> 35:33.899
we got him, we got him.

35:33.932 --> 35:36.368
We got him. I'll stand down.

35:36.402 --> 35:38.237
( sighs
and laughs )

35:38.270 --> 35:40.339
Well, this has turned out
to be a really good day.

35:40.372 --> 35:42.508
You called the FBI,
and I managed to convince Larry

35:42.541 --> 35:44.610
- to ask out Professor Wilson.
- Really?

35:44.643 --> 35:46.278
How'd you change his mind?

35:46.312 --> 35:48.314
I used game theory,
which says people

35:48.347 --> 35:50.282
will take bigger risks
for bigger gain.

35:50.316 --> 35:52.284
I pointed out that
he has the opportunity

35:52.318 --> 35:54.386
to turn a good friendship
into a great romance.

35:54.420 --> 35:56.688
And he actually bought
that from you?

35:56.722 --> 35:59.191
He wants to do it;
he just needed a good reason.

35:59.225 --> 36:00.292
I know.

36:00.326 --> 36:01.760
Amita,

36:01.793 --> 36:03.329
you know, you and I
have been working

36:03.362 --> 36:05.431
really closely together
these last couple weeks.

36:05.464 --> 36:06.965
I've had a great time.

36:06.998 --> 36:10.469
Actually, um, I was, uh,
just wondering if...

36:11.637 --> 36:13.305
Hey, Charlie?
Excuse me, I'm sorry

36:13.339 --> 36:14.573
Amita, can you give
us one second?

36:14.606 --> 36:16.975
Yeah, sure, I'll wait
for you downstairs.

36:17.008 --> 36:17.709
I'm sorry,
did I interrupt something?

36:17.743 --> 36:19.545
- Yes, you did.
- Well, look...

36:19.578 --> 36:21.947
- What is it?
- I just want to tell you

36:21.980 --> 36:23.982
that you're doing
great work here and...

36:24.015 --> 36:27.619
Oh. Well... well,
thanks, thank you.

36:27.653 --> 36:28.987
You know, I don't
know anyone who

36:29.020 --> 36:31.223
could've done what you
did with those notes,

36:31.257 --> 36:33.925
and I want you to know, I don't
take for granted what you do.

36:33.959 --> 36:35.361
I never thought you did.

36:35.394 --> 36:36.995
Good. So, what's the deal,

36:37.028 --> 36:38.797
you gonna ask her
out already?

36:40.866 --> 36:42.334
Well...

36:42.368 --> 36:43.802
Don't wait too long, man,

36:43.835 --> 36:45.704
or someone's gonna
snatch her up.

36:49.408 --> 36:50.909
I know my due date, I'm sorry.

36:50.942 --> 36:52.010
You're trying
to show me up, man.

36:52.043 --> 36:52.811
- No, man.
- I apologize.

36:52.844 --> 36:54.546
- Okay, all right.
- Okay, okay.

36:54.580 --> 36:55.547
( laughter )

36:55.581 --> 36:57.316
- There you go.
- Ah, excellent, Dad. Thank you.

36:57.349 --> 36:58.149
Okay. Thank you so much.

36:58.183 --> 36:58.984
No, no, no,
I was a good student.

36:59.017 --> 37:00.051
No, I just couldn't
get into math.

37:00.085 --> 37:02.153
Couldn't see how it could relate
to the real world.

37:06.024 --> 37:07.993
What? What did I say?

37:08.026 --> 37:09.595
DON: I think you're about to
find out.

37:09.628 --> 37:11.363
Oh, you guys are on your own.

37:11.397 --> 37:12.398
Good luck.

37:12.431 --> 37:14.566
CHARLIE: Math is the real world,
okay?

37:14.600 --> 37:17.369
It's everywhere, okay?

37:17.403 --> 37:18.837
- Hey, can I show you?
- Please.

37:23.342 --> 37:24.710
( chuckling )

37:24.743 --> 37:27.846
Um, you see how the...
the petals spiral?

37:27.879 --> 37:29.448
The number of petals

37:29.481 --> 37:32.918
in each row is the sum
of the preceding two rows.

37:32.951 --> 37:34.886
The Fibonacci sequence.

37:34.920 --> 37:36.054
It's found in...

37:36.087 --> 37:39.458
the structure of crystals
and the spiral of galaxies.

37:39.491 --> 37:41.059
In a nautilus shell.

37:41.092 --> 37:42.093
- That's amazing.
- What's more,

37:42.127 --> 37:45.297
the ratio between
each number in the sequence

37:45.331 --> 37:49.835
to the one before it
is approximately 1.61803.

37:49.868 --> 37:52.771
Wha-What the Greeks called
the Golden Ratio.

37:52.804 --> 37:54.440
It shows up.

37:54.473 --> 37:55.874
The pyramids at Giza

37:55.907 --> 37:58.410
and in the Parthenon
at Athens and...

37:58.444 --> 37:59.077
and the dimensions

37:59.110 --> 38:02.948
of this card.

38:02.981 --> 38:04.483
And it's based
on a number you can find

38:04.516 --> 38:07.085
in a flower? ( chuckles )

38:07.118 --> 38:09.621
Math is nature's language,

38:09.655 --> 38:15.327
its method of communicating
directly with us.

38:15.361 --> 38:17.028
So...

38:18.129 --> 38:20.666
Everything is numbers.

38:20.699 --> 38:22.768
Okay, well,
when you explain it like that,

38:22.801 --> 38:24.436
it's a lot more interesting.

38:24.470 --> 38:26.438
ALAN: Well, it seems like your
new math consultant's

38:26.472 --> 38:28.474
working out nicely.

38:28.507 --> 38:31.410
I got to tell you, Dad,
I can't think of anyone

38:31.443 --> 38:32.378
who could've helped us

38:32.411 --> 38:33.078
the way Charlie did
in the investigation.

38:33.111 --> 38:33.779
Just remember how Charlie is.

38:33.812 --> 38:35.747
Can't seem to quit a problem.

38:35.781 --> 38:37.549
He's still working
on the same one

38:37.583 --> 38:39.084
he's had since grade school.

38:39.117 --> 38:40.586
And what's that?

38:40.619 --> 38:42.588
Trying to impress
his big brother.

38:42.621 --> 38:45.123
Come on.

38:45.156 --> 38:47.092
( chuckling )

38:47.125 --> 38:48.994
Yeah, I've given that exact
speech to,

38:49.027 --> 38:51.630
uh, my-my junior class...

38:51.663 --> 38:53.532
He is going to test the
recurrence

38:53.565 --> 38:55.834
of the untwinnable moment.

38:55.867 --> 38:57.803
You think, maybe?

38:57.836 --> 39:00.439
( chattering indistinctly )

39:00.472 --> 39:03.475
Well, it's always a pleasure to
help with that.

39:09.681 --> 39:12.518
* And far away...
