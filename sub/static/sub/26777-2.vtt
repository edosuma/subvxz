the psychological reactions

41:25.149 --> 41:27.883
that these entities
are known to induce.

41:27.885 --> 41:31.353
Before closing the three gates
in a final ceremony,

41:31.355 --> 41:34.823
we use our thermal-imaging
camera and full-spectrum camera

41:34.825 --> 41:37.492
throughout the entire house,
but unfortunately,

41:37.494 --> 41:39.995
we are unable to document
any visual evidence

41:39.997 --> 41:42.464
of the entities
using these cameras.

41:42.466 --> 41:46.101
However, our SLS camera
did not let us down.

41:46.103 --> 41:51.306
The anomalies,
intelligent messages, voices,

41:51.308 --> 41:53.341
and poltergeist activity
have made

41:53.343 --> 41:56.711
our historic investigation
of the Westerfeld House

41:56.713 --> 41:59.214
one we'll never forget.
