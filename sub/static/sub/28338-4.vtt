WEBVTT

00:00.913 --> 00:03.663
[Star] All right,
sunglasses, flip-flops,

00:03.663 --> 00:06.543
colorful umbrella, and a cooler
stocked with snacks.

00:06.543 --> 00:09.293
I am so ready
for this day!

00:09.293 --> 00:11.713
Hey, I know that picture
is from the future,

00:11.713 --> 00:13.623
but how come I'm not in it?

00:13.623 --> 00:16.503
You're gonna be the one
taking the photo, silly goose.

00:16.503 --> 00:19.333
Oh! Well, yeah.
No, that makes sense.

00:19.333 --> 00:21.453
I do have a better eye
for composition.

00:21.453 --> 00:23.333
-[door opens]
-[Marco] Hey, guys?

00:23.333 --> 00:24.913
No making fun.

00:27.293 --> 00:28.663
[click]

00:28.663 --> 00:30.293
[laughing]

00:30.293 --> 00:33.953
Uh, Marco, what's
going on, uh, here?

00:33.953 --> 00:35.713
I couldn't find
my swimsuit,

00:35.713 --> 00:38.373
so Eclipsa let me borrow
one of Globgor's old ones.

00:38.373 --> 00:39.753
Instant classic.

00:39.753 --> 00:41.913
Yeah, I didn't think
this would work.

00:41.913 --> 00:43.413
[knock on door]

00:43.413 --> 00:46.123
Star, um, could
I borrow you for a moment?

00:46.123 --> 00:47.333
Of course!

00:47.333 --> 00:48.663
You guys, keep on
packing up snacks.

00:48.663 --> 00:50.583
I'll be right back.

00:50.583 --> 00:52.713
Sorry to take you
away from your friends,

00:52.713 --> 00:55.543
but I'm in a bit of a bind
at the moment.

00:55.543 --> 00:56.453
[gasp]

00:56.453 --> 00:58.413
[vortex rumbling]

00:58.413 --> 01:01.043
[Star]
Is that... Rhombulus?!

01:01.043 --> 01:03.413
What did you do to him?

01:03.413 --> 01:05.253
It's been so long
since I've wielded magic,

01:05.253 --> 01:07.413
things got
a little out of hand.

01:07.413 --> 01:09.503
It's far worse
than I ever meant.

01:09.503 --> 01:12.123
In the heat of the moment,
one spell led to another, and...

01:12.123 --> 01:15.543
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
back up and explain, please.

01:15.543 --> 01:17.253
All I did
was ask Rhombulus

01:17.253 --> 01:19.003
if he would use
his powers to free Globgor
from his crystal.

01:19.003 --> 01:21.503
But he got mad,
heated words were exchanged,

01:21.503 --> 01:22.913
yadda, yadda, yadda...

01:22.913 --> 01:24.913
-I think he might be dead.
-What?!

01:24.913 --> 01:27.213
Well, dead or
in a dreamless sleep forever.

01:27.213 --> 01:29.083
I'm not sure which.

01:29.083 --> 01:31.543
I didn't know what to do,
so I brought him back here.

01:31.543 --> 01:34.293
Whoa, whoa, wait.
Didn't the entire kingdom
see you do that?

01:34.293 --> 01:36.163
Oh, no, I'm pretty sneaky.

01:36.163 --> 01:38.583
Any progress, Glossaryck?

01:38.583 --> 01:41.003
Progress? [laughing]

01:41.003 --> 01:42.953
I don't work for you.

01:42.953 --> 01:44.503
Poke.

01:44.503 --> 01:46.253
-[phone ringing]
-Hold on a second, will you?

01:46.253 --> 01:48.213
Hey, uh, Star?
Glossaryck let me borrow

01:48.213 --> 01:50.623
one of his swim trunks,
but I think they're too small.

01:50.623 --> 01:52.333
They look great on him!

01:52.333 --> 01:53.913
Huh? Glossaryck?

01:53.913 --> 01:55.413
Are you
in two places at once?!

01:55.413 --> 01:56.793
Sometimes...

01:56.793 --> 01:58.793
...one place isn't
interesting enough.

01:58.793 --> 02:01.163
Can I just get your opinion
on these trunks before we go?

02:01.163 --> 02:03.413
Marco, I am busy!
Just pick a swimsuit!

02:03.413 --> 02:04.543
Okay, here we go,
Glossaryck.

02:04.543 --> 02:05.953
How do we fix this?

02:05.953 --> 02:08.623
I dunno.
I told Eclipsa to ask you.

02:08.623 --> 02:10.453
What?!
I can't fix this!

02:10.453 --> 02:13.453
Ugh! Eclipsa, can't you
just undo your spells?

02:13.453 --> 02:15.163
You know, in reverse?

02:15.163 --> 02:17.583
In reverse. Of course.

02:17.583 --> 02:19.293
I don't know
why I didn't think of that.

02:19.293 --> 02:20.503
Thank you, Star.

02:20.503 --> 02:21.873
I knew you'd
have the answer.

02:23.503 --> 02:25.453
[softly] Bubble-Bubble
Toil and Struggle.

02:26.913 --> 02:28.453
Cold Shoulder Ice Storm.

02:30.083 --> 02:32.373
Poison Gas Manipulation.

02:32.373 --> 02:33.503
[coughing]

02:33.503 --> 02:35.953
Sorry about that.

02:35.953 --> 02:38.003
And... Dreamless Sleep.

02:42.453 --> 02:44.833
[groaning]

02:44.833 --> 02:45.953
Hmm.

02:45.953 --> 02:47.373
[Snakes moaning]

02:47.373 --> 02:49.623
Hmm?! Eclipsa!

02:49.623 --> 02:51.663
-Aaah!
-[clank]

02:51.663 --> 02:53.713
Aaaaah!

02:53.713 --> 02:55.043
-[thud]
-[groans]

02:55.043 --> 02:56.953
You! You did this to me!

02:56.953 --> 02:58.753
You Rhomb-napped me!

02:58.753 --> 03:00.543
Okay, and you gotta
fix his hands.

03:00.543 --> 03:02.253
Aw... that's
my Ouroboros spell

03:02.253 --> 03:03.293
I'm proud of that one.

03:03.293 --> 03:04.453
Eclipsa...

03:04.453 --> 03:05.873
Okay, fine.

03:05.873 --> 03:06.913
Ouroboros.

03:06.913 --> 03:08.713
[Snakes gasp for air]

03:08.713 --> 03:11.663
[panting]

03:11.663 --> 03:13.293
You're nuts, lady!

03:13.293 --> 03:15.083
You have venom
on your face.

03:15.083 --> 03:17.043
Rrrrrr!

03:17.043 --> 03:19.083
I think you
owe him an apology

03:19.083 --> 03:21.333
Look, I'm sorry,
Rhombulus.

03:21.333 --> 03:23.753
I didn't mean
for things to get
so out of hand.

03:23.753 --> 03:25.503
Well, I'm sorry
your monster husband

03:25.503 --> 03:27.373
is a Mewman-eatin' menace!

03:27.373 --> 03:29.293
No, Rhombulus!
Stop for one second!

03:29.293 --> 03:30.953
She's trying to apologize!

03:30.953 --> 03:32.753
Exactly. I'm sorry that
Rhombulus doesn't know

03:32.753 --> 03:34.953
how to use
his inside voice!

03:34.953 --> 03:38.123
Globgor hasn't
eaten a Mewman since
before we started dating!

03:38.123 --> 03:40.083
Yeah! Wait, what?

03:40.083 --> 03:42.663
Once Globgor
and I fell in love,
he became a vegetarian.

03:42.663 --> 03:43.913
Just for me!

03:43.913 --> 03:45.713
He wouldn't eat a Mewman
if he was starving

03:45.713 --> 03:47.583
and it came
with a side of ranch!

03:47.583 --> 03:49.163
A likely story.

03:49.163 --> 03:51.123
Cool it, you two!

03:51.123 --> 03:53.373
Eclipsa, it's fair
that you would want
your hubby back.

03:53.373 --> 03:55.753
And, Rhombulus, you and the rest
of the Magical High Commission

03:55.753 --> 03:58.793
have your reasons
for not wanting
to free Globgor.

03:58.793 --> 04:01.663
But you both
just gotta talk it out.

04:01.663 --> 04:03.623
You probably won't reach
an agreement overnight.

04:03.623 --> 04:04.953
It might take years!

04:04.953 --> 04:06.833
But it is
the grown-up thing to do.

04:06.833 --> 04:09.123
Now, are we
all grown-ups here?

04:09.123 --> 04:10.713
-[Rhombulus] Yes!
-[Eclipsa] Yes!

04:10.713 --> 04:12.543
That's right.

04:12.543 --> 04:14.753
Oh, wait, except
I'm still a teenager,

04:14.753 --> 04:17.953
so I'm gonna go.

04:17.953 --> 04:19.753
Hey, Marco!
Strap Tom to that wagon,

04:19.753 --> 04:21.583
'cause I am ready
to hit the beach!

04:21.583 --> 04:23.753
-[crash]
-[gasp]

04:23.753 --> 04:24.753
Mewman-eater! Mewman-eater!

04:24.753 --> 04:26.543
Crystal-headed tyrant!

04:26.543 --> 04:27.753
-That's it!
-[phone beeps]

04:27.753 --> 04:29.753
Macaroon Mele Swarm!

04:29.753 --> 04:31.793
Aah!

04:31.793 --> 04:33.543
Megaaaa Narwhal Blast!

04:39.543 --> 04:41.953
I liked you better
when you were sleeping.

04:41.953 --> 04:43.913
Spiral Hypno Slumber!

04:45.373 --> 04:47.953
Nice try. Hypno Spells
bounce right off.

04:47.953 --> 04:49.663
Aaah!

04:49.663 --> 04:50.793
Oh, dear!

04:50.793 --> 04:53.623
[snoring]

04:53.623 --> 04:55.793
Hey, Star?
Uh, Tom likes 'em,

04:55.793 --> 04:59.043
but I think Glossaryck's trunks
are cutting off my circulation.

05:00.623 --> 05:03.373
Would your dad mind
if I borrowed his loincloth?

05:03.373 --> 05:04.453
[sighs]

05:04.453 --> 05:05.873
[snoring]

05:05.873 --> 05:07.873
[Marco] Star! Wake up!

05:07.873 --> 05:09.713
[groaning]

05:09.713 --> 05:12.253
My legs! Ohh!
So tingly!

05:12.253 --> 05:14.913
Dude! You'll never
guess where I found
your swimsuit.

05:14.913 --> 05:17.043
Aw, look
what you did to Star!

05:17.043 --> 05:19.583
Low Self-Esteem
Nightmare Dream.

05:20.583 --> 05:21.623
[grunts]

05:21.623 --> 05:24.373
Monkey stole 'em!
[laughing]

05:24.373 --> 05:25.953
[chattering]

05:25.953 --> 05:28.793
Is that... me?

05:28.793 --> 05:31.253
Am I wearing... make-up?

05:31.253 --> 05:33.213
I am!

05:33.213 --> 05:34.713
And-- and boots?!

05:34.713 --> 05:36.833
I mean, what am I thinking?

05:36.833 --> 05:39.753
Marco, am I ridiculous?

05:39.753 --> 05:41.253
You look fine, dude.

05:41.253 --> 05:42.753
Oh, no.

05:42.753 --> 05:46.413
I have terrible taste
in fashion and friends!

05:47.623 --> 05:48.583
Oh!

05:50.253 --> 05:51.623
I won't miss again!

05:51.623 --> 05:54.123
Low Self-Esteem
Nightmare Dream!

05:55.583 --> 05:57.123
[whimpering]

05:57.123 --> 06:01.253
Wait a second.
Are these my muscles?

06:01.253 --> 06:02.913
I'm not buff enough!

06:02.913 --> 06:03.953
I gotta work out!

06:03.953 --> 06:05.793
[straining, groans]

06:05.793 --> 06:08.123
-One, two, three...
-[Marco groaning]

06:08.123 --> 06:10.123
-[shrieking]
-[Glossaryck laughing]

06:10.123 --> 06:12.873
Star, wake up! Hah!

06:12.873 --> 06:14.833
Ugh! What happened?

06:14.833 --> 06:16.543
Aah! Loincloth?!

06:16.543 --> 06:17.753
What the heck is going on?!

06:17.753 --> 06:19.453
[Rhombulus] Eighty, ninety...

06:19.453 --> 06:21.583
Super Sonic Leach Bomb!

06:22.543 --> 06:23.873
-[beeping]
-[all screaming]

06:26.293 --> 06:27.453
Aaah! Ugh!

06:27.453 --> 06:29.213
[groaning]

06:29.213 --> 06:31.873
-Uh! Huh? Oh, no!
-[crystal shatters]

06:31.873 --> 06:33.793
My other crystal
Nipple Demon!

06:33.793 --> 06:36.163
I still wasn't sure
which one was evil.

06:36.163 --> 06:37.333
-[evil laughter]
-Huh?

06:37.333 --> 06:38.713
-[slap]
-Aaaah!

06:38.713 --> 06:41.043
[monkey chattering]

06:41.043 --> 06:42.583
[thud]

06:42.583 --> 06:43.913
-[voices screaming]
-[horse whinnying]

06:43.913 --> 06:45.453
-[crash]
-[monkey shrieking]

06:45.453 --> 06:48.373
-[horse whinnying]
-[voices screaming]

06:48.373 --> 06:51.373
Pretty sure that was
the good Nipple Demon.

06:51.373 --> 06:53.753
Yeah, I think
we can let him go.

06:53.753 --> 06:57.623
That's it! We can't have
Nipple Demons running
all over the place!

06:57.623 --> 06:59.793
-Tom?!
-What?!

06:59.793 --> 07:01.913
Take this sweaty teen
out of here.

07:01.913 --> 07:04.753
It's not my fault
this swimsuit's too tight.

07:04.753 --> 07:07.583
Mama's gotta deal
with these babies.

07:07.583 --> 07:09.753
Hey! No more!

07:09.753 --> 07:11.333
-What?
-[pop]

07:11.333 --> 07:13.583
Look, this thing is
gettin' out of hand.

07:13.583 --> 07:15.873
Why're you telling me?
She's the evil one!

07:15.873 --> 07:18.953
I should just recrystallize her
like her freak husband!

07:18.953 --> 07:20.663
Dude, saying stuff
like that

07:20.663 --> 07:22.753
is probably why
this is happening.

07:22.753 --> 07:24.753
She's the one who started it!

07:24.753 --> 07:26.543
[magical sound]

07:28.793 --> 07:31.003
Uh, Rhombulus?

07:38.623 --> 07:39.623
Eclipsa!

07:39.623 --> 07:41.793
What was that?!

07:41.793 --> 07:43.413
[Rhombulus]
Uh... huh?

07:43.413 --> 07:44.753
What?!

07:46.163 --> 07:47.793
Eclipsa?

07:47.793 --> 07:49.163
[Rhombulus]
Uh... uh...

07:49.163 --> 07:51.373
Why are there
so many holes in my face?!

07:51.373 --> 07:52.873
[Right Snake]
I don't like this!

07:52.873 --> 07:55.043
[Left Snake] Everything's
so dark and cold!

07:55.043 --> 07:56.213
[Eclipsa groaning]

07:57.713 --> 07:58.873
Eclipsa!

07:58.873 --> 08:00.753
[Eclipsa]
Okay, j-j-just hold on!

08:00.753 --> 08:03.003
Aah! Oof!

08:03.003 --> 08:05.003
You have no idea
what you're doing!

08:05.003 --> 08:06.953
Aah! Oooh!

08:06.953 --> 08:08.913
Eclipsa, stop!

08:08.913 --> 08:11.453
Ohh!

08:11.453 --> 08:12.913
Oh, man, that had to hurt!

08:12.913 --> 08:14.913
[laughing]

08:14.913 --> 08:16.373
[Snakes laughing]

08:16.373 --> 08:19.453
That was your body,
you idiot.

08:19.453 --> 08:20.583
Eclipsa,

08:20.583 --> 08:22.503
what are you doing?

08:22.503 --> 08:24.833
[Eclipsa]
I'm sorry, Star.
There's no other way.

08:24.833 --> 08:27.503
This is not the way
to get what you want!

08:30.793 --> 08:31.793
[gasp]

08:33.793 --> 08:36.333
You can't just take
someone else's body like this.

08:36.333 --> 08:38.213
It's gross! Ugh!

08:38.213 --> 08:40.253
How is anyone
supposed to trust you

08:40.253 --> 08:42.043
if you use spells like that?!

08:42.043 --> 08:45.293
How am I supposed
to trust you?

08:47.873 --> 08:48.953
[powering down]

08:51.873 --> 08:54.453
[sigh] You're right.

09:01.913 --> 09:03.713
[magical sound]

09:07.953 --> 09:09.833
-[Rhombulus] Huh?
-[Snakes] Oh, my gosh!

09:09.833 --> 09:11.913
We're back! All right!

09:11.913 --> 09:14.003
-Yah! Huh!
-What?!

09:14.003 --> 09:16.873
Hey, Rhombulus. You okay?

09:16.873 --> 09:19.663
Let's see. I was just
violated by dark magic.

09:19.663 --> 09:21.373
What do you think?

09:22.713 --> 09:25.623
I-- I'm sorry, Rhombulus.

09:25.623 --> 09:28.003
This isn't over,
Mewman-eater!

09:29.293 --> 09:31.003
Oh, I almost forgot.

09:31.003 --> 09:31.833
Hah!

09:34.503 --> 09:36.373
He's never getting
out of that crystal.

09:38.293 --> 09:40.083
Thank you, Star.

09:40.083 --> 09:42.543
I just wanted so badly
for Globgor to be free.

09:42.543 --> 09:43.793
But you're right.

09:45.663 --> 09:48.373
The kingdom comes first.

09:48.373 --> 09:50.163
[sigh]

09:52.083 --> 09:54.413
-[water boiling]
-Whoa!

09:54.413 --> 09:56.253
I still think
it's too warm.

09:56.253 --> 09:58.293
Nah, if it's boiling,
it's just right.

09:58.293 --> 10:00.083
Dude.

10:00.083 --> 10:02.043
What's--
What's going on here?

10:02.043 --> 10:04.583
Is this--
Is this what bro time is?

10:04.583 --> 10:05.873
What? No.

10:05.873 --> 10:07.043
While you were
still with Eclipsa,

10:07.043 --> 10:09.713
we decided why not
still have a beach day?

10:09.713 --> 10:13.043
Aw, you guys!
You didn't have to do this!

10:13.043 --> 10:15.083
We just wanted to do
something to make
your day better.

10:15.083 --> 10:17.623
-[chattering]
-Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!

10:17.623 --> 10:19.413
[holding back tears]

10:19.413 --> 10:21.623
Star, are you okay?

10:21.623 --> 10:23.833
Yeah, I'm okay.

10:23.833 --> 10:26.713
It's-- It's--
It's just so sweet!

10:26.713 --> 10:29.503
Awww!
Happy beach day, Star.

10:29.503 --> 10:33.213
Hey, Marco, did you ever
find that swimsuit?

10:33.213 --> 10:34.833
Uh, yeah, I did.

10:34.833 --> 10:37.873
It just looks better
on somebody else.
