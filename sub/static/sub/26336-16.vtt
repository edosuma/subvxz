How are you today?

03:24.503 --> 03:26.506
Im great, thank you.

03:26.538 --> 03:28.341
And you're doing great, too.

03:29.042 --> 03:32.010
Your signing is
really coming along.

03:32.045 --> 03:34.013
Ah, thank you.

03:34.046 --> 03:35.682
So, uh,

03:35.715 --> 03:38.850
what's my word of the day?

Ah.

Malasada.

Is that your way

03:48.026 --> 03:51.798

you're sick of sandwiches?

03:52.831 --> 03:54.834
Oh, please.

03:54.866 --> 03:57.704
This is my favorite
kind of sandwich.

03:57.736 --> 03:59.438
Free.

04:02.108 --> 04:03.508
Hey.

04:04.544 --> 04:06.378
Did you ever hear back

04:06.412 --> 04:10.349
about that... janitorial job?

04:10.383 --> 04:12.518
I did.

04:12.551 --> 04:14.820
They said they needed
a permanent address

04:14.853 --> 04:16.689
for the application.

04:18.625 --> 04:20.526
Im sorry to hear that.

04:22.095 --> 04:24.062
Hey.

04:24.096 --> 04:26.031
Next time,

04:26.064 --> 04:29.968
if you need to put down
an address,

04:30.002 --> 04:31.637
you can use mine.

04:31.670 --> 04:34.774
You've already
been so kind to me.

04:34.807 --> 04:38.610
Which is why I feel terrible

04:38.644 --> 04:40.079
asking you this.

04:43.048 --> 04:45.784
My granddaughter, Alexis...

04:45.817 --> 04:47.786
shes turning six next week,

04:47.819 --> 04:50.355
and I want to send
something back home to her.

04:51.456 --> 04:53.358
Im not asking for money.

04:53.393 --> 04:54.894
I have enough saved up.

04:54.927 --> 04:56.362
Its just...

04:57.896 --> 05:00.899
...I cant go into a kids
store looking like this.

05:06.072 --> 05:07.372
Of course.

05:07.406 --> 05:09.074
Just...

05:09.108 --> 05:12.110
tell me what you need,

05:12.144 --> 05:16.115
and Ill go pick it up for you.

05:16.149 --> 05:19.384
But heres the deal.

05:19.418 --> 05:22.055
I need you to meet me

05:22.088 --> 05:25.957
at the corner of 8th and Pahua

05:25.992 --> 05:29.629
in one hour. Deal?

05:29.661 --> 05:32.497
I don't suppose you're
gonna tell me why?

05:32.531 --> 05:35.468
You'll know soon enough.

05:36.502 --> 05:38.471
Okay, this is a first.

05:38.504 --> 05:42.175
You know, so I-Ive been
to, uh, band camp with Grace,

05:42.207 --> 05:44.076
took her, uh,
to circus camp once.

05:44.110 --> 05:45.677
I even heard of a place
called magic camp.

05:45.711 --> 05:47.547
But mermaid camp... this is
definitely something else.

05:47.579 --> 05:49.749
Sirens of the Seven
Seas is not a camp.

05:49.781 --> 05:51.884
Its Oahus premier
mermaid experience.

05:51.918 --> 05:53.418
Its also not for kids.

05:53.452 --> 05:55.420
Theres lots of grown
women who do this.

05:55.454 --> 05:58.557
They also pay up to $10,000
for these custom silicone tails.

05:58.591 --> 06:00.927
Ah. They should be spending
that money on therapy.

06:00.959 --> 06:02.562
That's on top of the
price of the course.

06:02.595 --> 06:03.995
This stuff is not cheap.

06:04.029 --> 06:05.531
They also have
these "finstructors"

06:05.564 --> 06:07.466
that are trained
synchronized swimmers,

06:07.500 --> 06:08.800
and they teach you,
you know, all the moves

06:08.834 --> 06:10.168
and how to hold your breath
underwater and stuff.

06:10.202 --> 06:12.204
Did you read
the brochure, or...?

06:12.237 --> 06:14.439
No, this has, like, kind
of been on my bucket list

06:14.473 --> 06:15.374
for my entire life.

06:15.408 --> 06:17.209
I love mermaids. I
really love mermaids.

06:17.242 --> 06:18.544
I-I watched

06:18.545 --> 06:19.846
<i>The Little Mermaid
so many times as a kid,</i>

06:19.879 --> 06:21.514
that I wore out the VHS.

06:21.547 --> 06:22.481
Try to hold yourself together,

06:22.514 --> 06:23.949
because we have
to investigate a murder here.

06:23.983 --> 06:26.018
Ah, I cannot make any promises.

06:26.052 --> 06:27.552
Hi.

06:27.586 --> 06:29.221
What do we have, guys?

06:29.254 --> 06:30.689
Well, from what I can tell,

06:30.723 --> 06:32.591
C.O.D. was acute poisoning.

06:32.625 --> 06:34.593
I won't know the exact kind
until I can run further tests,

06:34.627 --> 06:38.564
but my best guess would be
rodenticide, aka rat poison.

06:38.598 --> 06:40.533
If she was poisoned,
what's with all the blood?

06:40.566 --> 06:43.536
Because most rat poisons are
anticoagulants, which explains

06:43.569 --> 06:46.538
why our vic hemorrhaged
out of all of her orifices.

06:46.572 --> 06:47.606
Well, what do we know, Duke...
anything?

06:47.639 --> 06:49.141
Her names Gwendoline Baker.

06:49.175 --> 06:50.108
33 years old.

06:50.143 --> 06:51.644
She works for a health
and beauty company.

06:51.677 --> 06:53.579
Apparently, she booked out

06:53.612 --> 06:56.481
this whole place for
her top sales team.

06:56.516 --> 06:57.550
Huh. What about a spa day?

06:57.582 --> 06:58.884
Nobody does that
anymore, or what?

06:58.918 --> 07:00.218
Were in the process
of getting statements

07:00.252 --> 07:01.237
from everyone who was here.

07:01.238 --> 07:02.221
All right.

07:02.254 --> 07:03.790
Oh, this is interesting:

07:03.822 --> 07:06.793
did you know that, uh,
women are five times more likely

07:06.826 --> 07:10.228
to, uh, use poison
as a murder weapon than men?

07:10.262 --> 07:11.730
For the record,
were just as capable

07:11.764 --> 07:13.533
of using a gun or a knife.

07:13.565 --> 07:15.233
Ha, ha. Sister.

07:15.268 --> 07:17.069
Also, last time
I checked, poison was

07:17.103 --> 07:19.838
a common murder method for
both genders. Spouses, actually.

07:19.872 --> 07:22.742
Okay. That reminds me...
does she have a spouse?

07:22.774 --> 07:25.076
Her husband Josh
is off the island.

07:25.110 --> 07:27.146
He's coaching at a
tennis camp on Kauai.

07:27.180 --> 07:29.081
He's catching the
next flight back.

07:31.117 --> 07:33.252
I recognize her necklace.

07:33.286 --> 07:34.252
Duke, what did you say
that company

07:34.286 --> 07:35.620
she worked for is called?

07:35.654 --> 07:38.591
It was, um, Plum & Rose Beauty.

07:38.624 --> 07:40.158
What is that...
you heard of it or something?

07:40.192 --> 07:42.093
Yeah.

07:43.562 --> 07:45.197
<i>Imagine your ideal life.</i>

07:45.230 --> 07:47.533
<i>The places you'd visit.</i>

07:47.567 --> 07:49.701
<i>The experiences you'd have.</i>

07:49.735 --> 07:52.038
<i>Everything you could
possibly want.</i>

07:52.071 --> 07:53.605
<i>Well, Plum & Rose Beauty</i>

07:53.639 --> 07:56.576
<i>can make all
of those dreams come true.</i>

07:56.608 --> 07:59.579
<i>If you told me five years ago
that this would be my life,</i>

07:59.612 --> 08:00.879
<i>I would have said
you were crazy.</i>

08:00.913 --> 08:02.682
Yet here I am.

08:02.714 --> 08:05.550
<i>I started with Plum & Rose
Beauty as a way</i>

08:05.584 --> 08:07.819
to supplement
my schoolteacher income.

08:07.853 --> 08:09.288
But by my second month,

08:09.322 --> 08:10.990
my sales commissions

08:11.023 --> 08:13.625
had surpassed my yearly income.

08:13.658 --> 08:16.295
And me? I got to retire at 38
cause this boss lady

08:16.329 --> 08:17.963
makes six figures a month.

08:17.997 --> 08:20.766
Thanks, honey.
But Im not special.

08:20.800 --> 08:24.637
Plum & Rose Beauty is for anyone
whos motivated, coachable

08:24.670 --> 08:28.074
and looking to live
their best life.

08:32.077 --> 08:34.647
If that sounds like you,
then don't wait.

08:34.679 --> 08:36.315
Join our sisterhood today.

08:36.349 --> 08:40.186
Im Gwendoline Baker, and my
greatest joy is showing people

08:40.219 --> 08:42.053
how to live
the life of their dreams.

08:47.894 --> 08:50.629
See, I get that shes selling
a load of crap, and yet

08:50.663 --> 08:52.298
you still kind of
want to buy it.

08:52.331 --> 08:53.966
Buy what?
I just watched the video, too,

08:54.000 --> 08:55.134
I have no idea
what shes selling.

08:55.167 --> 08:56.302
Plum & Rose

08:56.335 --> 08:57.302
is a beauty and health company

08:57.336 --> 08:59.605
that sells a wide range
of skin care products,

08:59.639 --> 09:01.841
but what they're really selling
is a lifestyle,

09:01.874 --> 09:04.342
with some aspirational female
empowerment stuff peppered in.

09:04.376 --> 09:07.046
And these ladies
are all about the gram.

09:08.246 --> 09:10.115
Instagram, people.
You know, exotic vacations

09:10.149 --> 09:12.717
and-and champagne brunches
and mermaid camps.

09:12.751 --> 09:14.220
They put it all on social media

09:14.253 --> 09:15.154
so it boosts the brand.

09:15.155 --> 09:16.054
It just seems

09:16.087 --> 09:18.624
like a-a lot of work
to sell hand cream.

09:18.658 --> 09:20.025
They're not doing it
to sell hand cream,

09:20.058 --> 09:22.360
they're doing it
to recruit new sellers.

09:22.394 --> 09:25.130
Its called multilevel marketing.

09:25.163 --> 09:26.666
So with every new client
brought in,

09:26.698 --> 09:28.100
you get a commission
off the purchase

09:28.134 --> 09:29.100
of the initial starter kit,

09:29.134 --> 09:31.102
and then every subsequent sale.

09:31.136 --> 09:33.873
I know this because I went
to high school with a girl

09:33.905 --> 09:35.140
who kept pestering me to join.

09:35.173 --> 09:37.076
And I had to unfriend her
on Facebook.

09:37.109 --> 09:37.909
Its a pyramid scheme.

09:37.943 --> 09:39.378
- That's what it is.
- Our victim

09:39.412 --> 09:40.745
Was at the top
of the food chain.

09:40.779 --> 09:42.114
Yeah, which could have
made her a target.

09:42.148 --> 09:44.082
Elite sellers like Gwendoline...
shes an exception

09:44.115 --> 09:45.750
to the rule.
Most people that join...

09:45.784 --> 09:47.119
they spend thousands
and thousands of dollars

09:47.153 --> 09:49.120
on these starter kits
that they cant sell,

09:49.154 --> 09:51.222
and then they end up broke
and totally screwed.

09:51.256 --> 09:52.390
So, if Gwendoline

09:52.424 --> 09:55.061
had hundreds of people
selling under her...

09:55.094 --> 09:57.096
Then that means theres
hundreds of people

09:57.129 --> 09:59.097
who might have struck
out and gone broke.

09:59.130 --> 10:00.765
Uhp, update from Noelani.

10:00.799 --> 10:03.369
So the poison turns
out to be foxglove,

10:03.402 --> 10:06.138
and it was ingested
between six and 24 hours

10:06.172 --> 10:07.123
before time of death.

10:07.124 --> 10:08.073
Okay.

10:08.106 --> 10:10.275
So that means were not
just looking for people

10:10.308 --> 10:11.409
at the mermaid camp,
we need to consider

10:11.443 --> 10:13.278
anyone who
came in contact with her

10:13.312 --> 10:15.114
over the last 24 hours.

10:15.147 --> 10:17.082
Right. And if Gwendoline
is responsible

10:17.115 --> 10:18.783
for ripping a whole bunch
of people off,

10:18.817 --> 10:20.686
that means our suspect pool
just exploded.

10:20.720 --> 10:21.988
Hey, I found
something interesting

10:22.020 --> 10:24.123
on Gwendolines phone.

10:24.155 --> 10:25.924
Two weeks ago,

10:25.957 --> 10:29.794
she texted pictures
to an auto insurance agent.

10:29.828 --> 10:31.129
The Benz from the video.

10:31.163 --> 10:32.865
Does that say "die" on the car?

10:32.898 --> 10:35.701
Talk about telegraphing
your next move.

10:35.735 --> 10:37.302
Good work, Jerry.
You realize

10:37.336 --> 10:38.170
what you just found, right?

10:38.171 --> 10:39.004
Yeah.

10:39.038 --> 10:41.907
Whoever did this
is likely our killer.

10:55.287 --> 10:57.956
As requested,
one purple elephant.

10:57.990 --> 11:00.426
She gonna love it.

11:00.458 --> 11:02.128
Thank you.

11:02.160 --> 11:04.897
You're welcome.

11:04.929 --> 11:07.832
And this is for you.

11:07.866 --> 11:09.201
I get an elephant, too?

11:09.235 --> 11:11.302
No. Much better.

11:11.336 --> 11:13.706
Some new clothes.

11:17.442 --> 11:19.245
Which you're going to put on

11:19.278 --> 11:21.080
after we go get you

11:21.113 --> 11:23.783
a shave and a haircut.

11:25.418 --> 11:27.385
I don't understand.

11:27.419 --> 11:30.056
Hal, I think

11:30.088 --> 11:33.759
you should deliver that gift

11:33.793 --> 11:36.528
to your granddaughter in person.

11:36.562 --> 11:40.265
And if you're okay with it,

11:40.298 --> 11:42.500
Id like to...

11:42.534 --> 11:45.236
pay for your ticket.

11:45.270 --> 11:47.472
Adam.

11:47.505 --> 11:49.542
I don't know what to say.

11:49.575 --> 11:52.745
Just say yes.

12:23.241 --> 12:26.778
I haven't seen this guy
in a long time.

12:28.313 --> 12:29.447
<i>Okay...</i>

12:29.481 --> 12:32.884
I have to ask:

12:32.918 --> 12:34.452
why are you doing
all this for me?

12:34.486 --> 12:37.456
Because everyone deserves

12:37.490 --> 12:39.125
a second chance.

12:41.860 --> 12:44.062
Get yourself a shower,

12:44.096 --> 12:46.565
then meet me

12:46.599 --> 12:49.301
at Kamekonas shrimp truck.

12:49.335 --> 12:51.403
Well get a good meal in you,

12:51.437 --> 12:53.838
and then Ill drive you

12:53.873 --> 12:55.508
to the airport.

12:57.475 --> 12:59.912
You're a good man.

13:13.558 --> 13:17.229
Yo, look at Gwendolines
last Instagram post.

13:17.263 --> 13:20.298
Wow.
That's, uh, pretty creepy.

13:20.331 --> 13:21.500
Shed already
been poisoned by then.

13:21.533 --> 13:22.967
She just didn't know.

13:23.001 --> 13:24.570
Oh, yeah.

13:25.904 --> 13:27.173
Hey, check this out.

13:27.206 --> 13:28.541
I-I think I got something.

13:28.573 --> 13:30.009
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

13:30.042 --> 13:32.010
Well, it looks like
someone ripped her pretty good

13:32.043 --> 13:33.611
in the comments section.

13:33.645 --> 13:35.614
Okay, Joons, um,
social media 101...

13:35.648 --> 13:37.316
that's called trolling.

13:37.349 --> 13:38.183
- Trolling.
- Trolling.

13:38.216 --> 13:39.084
- Trolling?
- Trolling.

13:39.118 --> 13:40.485
Okay. Check out this trolling.

13:40.519 --> 13:43.989
It-it says that, um,
"Your whole life is a con.

13:44.023 --> 13:46.125
You profit off
of other peoples misery."

13:46.158 --> 13:47.625
Wow.

13:47.659 --> 13:49.061
Look at this.

13:49.094 --> 13:51.596
Shopping trips to Monte Carlo,

13:51.629 --> 13:55.301
box seats at the Super Bowl,
lots of trips on private jets.

13:55.334 --> 13:58.070
Like, Im jealous
of this womans life,

13:58.102 --> 13:59.572
and she dead.

13:59.605 --> 14:02.607
Well, a little birdie did tell
me this morning that you were

14:02.640 --> 14:04.009
pretty jealous
of the mermaid camp.

14:05.977 --> 14:07.613
Um, did this birdie
have a blonde pompadour

14:07.645 --> 14:09.114
and talk with his hands?

14:09.148 --> 14:11.182
Ah. Correct.

14:11.216 --> 14:13.184
Well, uh, I guess
that every little girl

14:13.219 --> 14:16.087
who watched that movie
wanted to be a mermaid, right?

14:16.120 --> 14:19.557
Well, that, yes, obviously.

14:19.591 --> 14:21.927
Okay, also, when
I was a little kid,

14:21.961 --> 14:24.096
I was terrified of the water.

14:24.129 --> 14:27.966
Until my dad convinced me
that mermaids were real.

14:28.000 --> 14:28.851
What?

14:28.852 --> 14:29.701
And then,

14:29.735 --> 14:33.105
I kid you not, he could not
get me out of the ocean.

14:33.138 --> 14:34.940
Every weekend, we would go to

14:34.974 --> 14:38.677
<i>Kuilima Cove, and wed swim
in the coral reef.</i>

14:38.711 --> 14:41.246
I would just dive in,

14:41.279 --> 14:43.381
and just-just hope

14:43.414 --> 14:46.518
<i>to get a glimpse of a mermaid,
just-just a glimpse.</i>

14:46.552 --> 14:47.552
<i>And then, I would...</i>

14:47.586 --> 14:50.121
I would hold my breath
for as long as I could,

14:50.154 --> 14:52.557
and then I would swim up
to the top, and I would

14:52.591 --> 14:54.158
get some air, and
then dive back down,

14:54.192 --> 14:56.128
and I would do that
over and over and over

14:56.161 --> 14:57.629
until, um, I was

14:57.663 --> 15:01.634
so exhausted that
my dad would...

15:01.667 --> 15:03.969
Hed come and pick me up and

15:04.003 --> 15:06.138
carry me to our towels, and, um,

15:06.171 --> 15:08.274
yeah, wed just fall
asleep in the sun.

15:10.743 --> 15:13.211
That sounds like a great dad.

15:13.245 --> 15:15.346
Yeah, he was.

15:26.759 --> 15:28.726
I know. I know,

15:28.760 --> 15:31.062
Im not who you came to see.

15:31.096 --> 15:32.697
In fact, I wouldn't even

15:32.730 --> 15:33.698
be with you here today

15:33.731 --> 15:35.200
if a certain someone

15:35.234 --> 15:37.635
hadn't retired her husband

15:37.669 --> 15:39.404
and saved him
from a boring career

15:39.437 --> 15:41.706
in corporate real estate.

15:41.740 --> 15:43.676
So please allow me
to welcome to the stage

15:43.709 --> 15:47.011
the head honcho, grand dame and

15:47.046 --> 15:50.682
She-E-O of Plum & Rose,

15:50.716 --> 15:52.084
your favorite badass,

15:52.116 --> 15:55.287
and my much better half,
Jocelyn Greene!

15:55.321 --> 15:57.155
♪ Thanks for making me
a fighter ♪

15:57.188 --> 16:00.024
♪ Made me learn
a little bit faster... ♪

16:00.058 --> 16:03.062
Ladies and gentlemen,
my husband, Trent!

16:05.663 --> 16:06.631
Thank you so much, sweetheart,

16:06.664 --> 16:08.767
for that amazing introduction.

16:08.801 --> 16:11.470
Okay, how many of you
can relate to this?

16:14.472 --> 16:18.210
You wake up late, hit snooze,
rush the kids to school,

16:18.243 --> 16:20.778
report to boring meetings,
fight rush-hour traffic,

16:20.812 --> 16:24.750
put the kids to bed, and
finally, fall asleep, exhausted.

16:24.783 --> 16:27.619
Already dreading having
to do it all over again

16:27.653 --> 16:29.355
the next day,<i> Groundhog Day</i>

16:29.356 --> 16:31.056
style.

16:31.090 --> 16:32.825
Mombies! All of you!

16:32.857 --> 16:35.793
Admit it! The-the days

16:35.827 --> 16:38.062
turn into weeks,
turn into months,

16:38.096 --> 16:39.414
and then you look old, and you

16:39.415 --> 16:40.732
<i>have</i>

16:38.096 --> 16:40.732
to buy our eye cream.

16:40.765 --> 16:42.801
I am here

16:42.835 --> 16:45.571
to tell you theres a better life

16:45.604 --> 16:47.172
waiting for you.

16:47.206 --> 16:50.174
So, you feeling inspired?

16:50.209 --> 16:52.811
Shoot. I wish my wife
would retire her husband.

16:52.845 --> 16:54.645
Play nothing but
golf all day long?

16:54.679 --> 16:56.215
Man, I can get down with that.

16:56.248 --> 16:57.750
Its absolutely devastating.

16:57.783 --> 16:59.684
I mean, Gwen wasn't
just my top seller.

16:59.717 --> 17:01.720
She was a dear friend.

17:01.754 --> 17:03.721
You-you didn't... you didn't
want to cancel this then,

17:03.755 --> 17:04.890
if she was a dear friend?

17:04.923 --> 17:07.192
Oh, believe me, I would have
preferred to, but, I mean,

17:07.226 --> 17:09.260
this was scheduled for months,
and most of these women...

17:09.294 --> 17:10.796
they flew in
from the mainland for it.

17:10.828 --> 17:12.765
- Yeah, I get it.
- No point in

17:12.798 --> 17:14.598
having people miss the
opportunity of a lifetime

17:14.633 --> 17:15.867
to get royally screwed.

17:15.901 --> 17:17.868
Excuse me?

17:17.903 --> 17:19.872
You run a pyramid scheme.

17:19.904 --> 17:22.374
You sell these people
on getting rich quick

17:22.406 --> 17:24.777
and getting fast money, and
then, you just leave em broke

17:24.809 --> 17:27.211
with a hundred boxes
of lotion and shampoo.

17:27.246 --> 17:29.781
Look, selling is hard, but

17:29.815 --> 17:31.349
so is life.

17:31.383 --> 17:33.352
Big opportunities call
for big risks.

17:33.384 --> 17:34.886
We offer people the tools
to change their lives.

17:34.920 --> 17:36.121
Whether or not they succeed,

17:36.154 --> 17:37.756
that's... that's up to them.

17:37.789 --> 17:40.692
You can save
the sales pitch, respectfully.

17:40.726 --> 17:41.759
Gwendoline was one of
your top sellers.

17:41.794 --> 17:43.295
You said that, didn't you?

17:43.327 --> 17:45.596
Yeah. I mean, she...
she was a natural-born closer.

17:45.631 --> 17:47.833
In fact, we were
getting ready to induct her

17:47.865 --> 17:48.866
into our Golden Circle.

17:48.901 --> 17:50.469
And what in the hell is that?

17:50.501 --> 17:52.237
Its the highest level
of our company.

17:52.270 --> 17:53.872
Gwen was the fastest person
in the history of Plum & Rose

17:53.905 --> 17:55.441
to achieve it.

17:55.473 --> 17:57.709
So what you're really
saying is that she ended up

17:57.742 --> 17:59.177
recruiting a whole
bunch of sellers,

17:59.211 --> 18:01.145
and that's how you
get into this circle.

18:01.180 --> 18:03.515
And these sellers, Im sure,
were not very happy people

18:03.548 --> 18:06.151
when they were stuck with all of
this product that you're selling

18:06.184 --> 18:08.554
and no place to unload it.

18:08.586 --> 18:10.189
Any of those people
threaten you?

18:10.221 --> 18:11.789
Well, sure,
there were some cases,

18:11.824 --> 18:14.926
but we take the safety
of our people very seriously.

18:14.960 --> 18:17.528
We have a security team that
investigates all such cases.

18:17.563 --> 18:19.698
Good. Were gonna need
all the records

18:19.730 --> 18:22.166
from these, uh,
"investigations."

18:22.201 --> 18:24.869
Oh, also, uh, were
gonna need a-a list

18:24.903 --> 18:27.205
of all of Gwendolines
sellers, top to bottom,

18:27.239 --> 18:30.409
throughout the whole,
uh, scheme, pyramid...

18:30.442 --> 18:31.410
whatever you call it.

18:31.442 --> 18:33.945
Of course.
Whatever you need.

18:35.447 --> 18:38.549
Yes, Steve. What's up?

18:38.584 --> 18:40.952
Hey, Danny, listen,
Im here with Junior and Tani.

18:40.986 --> 18:42.855
They just got a lead
on our car vandal.

18:42.887 --> 18:44.756
You know that phrase
that was spray-painted

18:44.789 --> 18:46.858
on Gwendolines car,
"women who bleed"?

18:46.892 --> 18:50.194
It turns out its actually
a play on an Instagram hashtag

18:50.229 --> 18:52.897
that she would use sometimes:
"women who lead."

18:52.931 --> 18:54.432
Oh, its wordplay.
That's clever.

18:54.465 --> 18:55.901
And that hashtag,
#WomenWhoBleed,

18:55.933 --> 18:57.903
made it into
the comments section

18:57.935 --> 19:00.905
of four of Gwendolines posts,
all by the same user.

19:00.939 --> 19:03.474
We tracked the account back
to a Makani Pule.

19:03.509 --> 19:04.977
Were sending you over
a photo now.

19:05.009 --> 19:06.944
We got no
current address on Makani,

19:06.979 --> 19:09.480
but she does have
a car registered under her name.

19:09.515 --> 19:11.849
I asked Duke to put out a BOLO,
and he got a hit.

19:11.884 --> 19:12.884
Wheres the car?

19:17.955 --> 19:18.923
What's up?

19:18.957 --> 19:19.958
Can I help you?

19:19.991 --> 19:21.359
What the hell?
Get out of my car.

19:21.393 --> 19:22.994
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Take care, now.

19:23.028 --> 19:24.829
This is Five-O business.
Let the man work.

19:24.863 --> 19:26.699
What's this about?

19:26.700 --> 19:28.534
Gwendoline Baker.

19:28.567 --> 19:29.734
Were investigating her murder.

19:29.768 --> 19:30.801
I don't know anything
about that.

19:30.836 --> 19:34.272
Do you know anything about
vandalizing someones car?

19:34.306 --> 19:36.942
You know something about that?

19:39.744 --> 19:41.846
I know how dumb I must look,

19:41.880 --> 19:44.782
but six months ago,
my husband left me.

19:44.816 --> 19:46.417
I was alone and scared.

19:46.451 --> 19:48.452
Then I stumbled across
Gwendolines Facebook page

19:48.487 --> 19:49.654
and saw the life she had...

19:49.688 --> 19:52.891
the friends, the clothes,
the parties... and I thought

19:52.924 --> 19:55.460
maybe I can have that, too.

19:55.493 --> 19:58.596
So I dove in and spent
my entire savings

19:58.630 --> 20:00.332
to sell for Plum & Rose.

20:00.365 --> 20:02.701
Yeah, Im guessing that didn't
work out for you, did it?

20:04.903 --> 20:06.337
Pop the trunk.

20:08.606 --> 20:12.344
Why do you think I come
to the gym to shower?

20:12.376 --> 20:13.411
You're living out of your car.

20:13.412 --> 20:14.445
Humbling to have

20:14.479 --> 20:17.749
all your worldly possessions fit
in the trunk of a Volkswagen.

20:17.782 --> 20:19.317
Yeah.

20:19.351 --> 20:21.286
The only other thing
I have to my name

20:21.319 --> 20:23.588
is 15K worth of
Plum & Rose product

20:23.622 --> 20:25.624
that's gathering dust
in a storage locker.

20:25.656 --> 20:26.892
Yeah, you're breaking my heart.

20:26.924 --> 20:28.594
You know, if somebody took me

20:28.626 --> 20:30.461
for everything I had,
Id be pretty angry.

20:30.494 --> 20:33.632
Maybe Id vandalize their car.
Maybe Id even kill em.

20:33.664 --> 20:36.500
Ill admit I went on a bit of
a bender a couple weeks back

20:36.535 --> 20:39.570
and vandalized Gwendolines car,
but I didn't kill her.

20:39.605 --> 20:41.772
Do you have an alibi
for the last 36 hours?

20:41.807 --> 20:43.608
As a matter of fact, I do.

20:43.642 --> 20:44.843
Hey, what do you got?

20:44.875 --> 20:47.479
So, Makani spent the last
48 hours at a detox center.

20:47.511 --> 20:48.480
I called the place.

20:48.512 --> 20:50.682
It checks out.
She left at 10:00 this morning.

20:50.715 --> 20:54.086
Which puts her well outside
of our 24-hour poisoning window.

20:54.118 --> 20:55.921
Right. Which leads us
back to square one;

20:55.953 --> 20:57.990
no leads, and a gigantic
suspect pool.

20:58.022 --> 21:00.459
All right, well, look, Jerrys
over at the victims house now.

21:00.491 --> 21:01.660
Lets hope he finds something.

21:07.598 --> 21:09.101
Hey, Noelani, what's up?

21:09.134 --> 21:10.085
Hey, I heard you're at
our victims house.

21:10.086 --> 21:11.036
That's right.

21:11.068 --> 21:13.372
Well, that's good because
I just got the lab results back

21:13.404 --> 21:14.573
on the contents of her stomach.

21:14.605 --> 21:15.574
Oh? Did you find
anything interesting?

21:15.606 --> 21:18.343
Yeah, collagen.

21:19.544 --> 21:21.813
Okay, I got, uh, banana peels,

21:21.846 --> 21:23.749
some bags of frozen fruit,

21:23.781 --> 21:25.584
pineapple, peaches,

21:25.616 --> 21:28.452
shredded coconut,
a box of flax seeds...

21:28.487 --> 21:29.421
All right, all of those items

21:29.453 --> 21:31.423
were in Gwendolines stomach
when she died.

21:31.455 --> 21:32.557
Yeah, it looks like
she was a juicer.

21:32.590 --> 21:34.692
Im definitely getting
a smoothie vibe.

21:34.726 --> 21:35.961
Well, that makes sense because

21:35.993 --> 21:37.596
heres the thing about foxglove.

21:37.628 --> 21:39.431
Its a bitter plant
similar to kale,

21:39.463 --> 21:41.932
so whoever dosed her needed to
make sure they masked the taste.

21:41.967 --> 21:43.634
Oh, what do we have here?

21:43.669 --> 21:45.703
A single-serve packet

21:45.737 --> 21:49.540
of Plum & Rose
beauty collagen powder.

21:49.574 --> 21:51.942
Oh, it looks like someone...

21:51.977 --> 21:54.413
made an incision in the seam

21:54.445 --> 21:57.982
that someone put back together
with adhesive to reseal it.

21:58.016 --> 22:00.551
Theres only one reason why it
would have been tampered with.

22:00.585 --> 22:02.421
Yeah.
Death, thy name is smoothie.

22:02.453 --> 22:04.388
I just found our murder weapon.

22:11.496 --> 22:13.597
<i>What's wrong with you people?</i>

22:13.632 --> 22:15.767
I keep telling you,
I didn't kill my wife.

22:15.800 --> 22:17.469
All right, well,
we get your, uh,

22:17.501 --> 22:19.704
position vis-à-vis
murdering your wife,

22:19.738 --> 22:21.673
but we deal with a thing
called evidence.

22:21.707 --> 22:22.941
What evidence?

22:22.973 --> 22:24.809
I wasn't even on island
when she died.

22:24.843 --> 22:26.611
That's true. He was, uh...

22:26.644 --> 22:27.712
was at a tennis tournament.

22:27.713 --> 22:28.779
Yeah.

22:28.814 --> 22:30.781
And that,
that right there made, uh,

22:30.816 --> 22:31.916
made your plan look even better.

22:31.950 --> 22:33.117
Didnt it, Josh?

22:33.151 --> 22:34.720
I don't understand.

22:34.752 --> 22:35.787
Well, you knew
your wifes routine

22:35.820 --> 22:36.922
better than anybody, right?

22:36.954 --> 22:39.857
You knew that the days
that your wife went to the gym,

22:39.891 --> 22:40.909
she drank a smoothie
first thing in the morning.

22:40.910 --> 22:41.926
Yeah, so?

22:41.960 --> 22:43.828
In theory, you could have

22:43.862 --> 22:45.130
slipped something
into her, um...

22:45.163 --> 22:47.833
I don't know, like,
her collagen supplement.

22:47.865 --> 22:48.700
Left town...

22:48.733 --> 22:51.502
knowing shes gonna
make a smoothie

22:51.536 --> 22:53.204
and drink the thing on Monday.

22:53.238 --> 22:56.508
So then she dies, you come back,
you got a perfect alibi.

22:56.540 --> 22:58.009
Right, except you forgot about

22:58.042 --> 23:00.045
the Warfarin... your wifes
Warfarin prescription

23:00.077 --> 23:01.579
for her heart condition.

23:01.613 --> 23:03.815
That drug,
combined with the poison,

23:03.848 --> 23:05.150
causes massive hemorrhaging.

23:05.182 --> 23:06.718
But if it wasn't
for that, right,

23:06.751 --> 23:08.086
it would have just looked like

23:08.119 --> 23:09.820
a good old-fashioned
heart attack.

23:09.855 --> 23:12.857
Guys, I love my wife.

23:12.891 --> 23:14.192
Why would I want to kill her?

23:14.226 --> 23:16.761
I don't know,
but won't you do me a favor

23:16.795 --> 23:19.730
and pretend you've never seen
these papers before.

23:19.765 --> 23:22.067
We got that draft from her
computer, the divorce papers.

23:22.099 --> 23:23.934
No, look, you got
to understand something.

23:23.969 --> 23:25.871
My wife was a hothead.

23:25.903 --> 23:27.638
She threatened divorce
when we fought,

23:27.672 --> 23:28.724
but we always worked it out.

23:28.725 --> 23:29.775
And that worked out

23:29.807 --> 23:31.542
good for you, didn't it?
Cause when you married her,

23:31.576 --> 23:32.911
you signed a rock-solid
prenup that said

23:32.943 --> 23:34.045
if you guys split,
you get nothing.

23:34.078 --> 23:36.480
Right, u-unless she
dies of a heart attack

23:36.515 --> 23:38.583
or something like that,
then you get a $3 million

23:38.616 --> 23:40.519
life insurance policy.

23:40.551 --> 23:42.086
You think Id kill my wife
for money?

23:42.119 --> 23:44.155
Yeah. That's...
that's what were...

23:44.189 --> 23:45.824
that's what were
talking about here.

23:45.856 --> 23:47.826
So, the money, the house,

23:47.858 --> 23:50.694
the cars, the whole lifestyle,
that was Gwens thing.

23:50.729 --> 23:51.930
Guys, look, I know
its hard to believe,

23:51.962 --> 23:53.164
but come on.

23:53.198 --> 23:55.066
I mean, when we first met,
we had nothing.

23:55.099 --> 23:56.601
And to be honest,

23:56.634 --> 23:58.903
we were happier back then,
you know?

23:58.936 --> 24:00.739
I mean, Gwen loved her job.

24:00.771 --> 24:02.907
A-And I loved
that she was so good at it.

24:02.941 --> 24:04.976
But it lost a lot of luster
towards the end there.

24:05.009 --> 24:06.912
Lot of luster?
Wh-What's that mean?

24:06.944 --> 24:08.496
Gwen was thinking about
leaving the company.

24:08.497 --> 24:10.048
Leaving the company?

24:10.080 --> 24:11.817
All that success,
all that money,

24:11.849 --> 24:13.852
why would she
want to give that up?

24:13.884 --> 24:15.921
Because something shady
was going on over there.

24:15.953 --> 24:17.556
At least that's...
that's what Gwen said.

24:17.588 --> 24:19.223
Shady?
Like, more shady than the...

24:19.257 --> 24:20.991
the life-ruining pyramid scheme?

24:21.026 --> 24:23.060
I-I don't know
what it was, okay?

24:23.094 --> 24:25.096
She wouldn't tell me.

24:25.130 --> 24:26.832
But if I were you two,

24:26.865 --> 24:29.000
Id take a closer look
at Plum & Rose.

24:29.034 --> 24:31.603
Okay. So, just so Im clear,

24:31.635 --> 24:33.872
you, uh... you got...
you got motive,

24:33.904 --> 24:37.608
uh, your alibi
has been destroyed

24:37.642 --> 24:40.679
and, um, you...
just because you say so,

24:40.711 --> 24:42.614
we should go off on this hunch?

24:42.646 --> 24:44.715
I don't know what to say.

24:44.749 --> 24:46.151
Its the truth.

25:03.201 --> 25:05.903
Your buddy came by.

25:05.936 --> 25:08.807
Said to give you this.

25:18.916 --> 25:20.652
You okay, bruddah?

25:22.921 --> 25:24.355
<i>I guess your friend wasn't ready</i>

25:24.388 --> 25:25.891
<i>to face his family.</i>

25:28.993 --> 25:30.862
Yeah, maybe not.

25:32.096 --> 25:34.766
But Im not giving up
on him so easily.

25:37.935 --> 25:40.971
When I was a keiki,
we used to go around

25:41.006 --> 25:43.040
to Mr. Mokis corner store.

25:43.074 --> 25:45.175
One day I was in there,

25:45.210 --> 25:49.013
Mr. Moki himself caught me
swiping a candy bar.

25:50.749 --> 25:53.050
This man used to
help out my moms

25:53.084 --> 25:57.087
when she didn't have enough
for groceries.

25:57.122 --> 25:59.023
God bless that man.

25:59.057 --> 26:01.992
He knew I was better than that.

26:02.027 --> 26:04.395
He told me he would
hook me up with a job

26:04.429 --> 26:06.298
if I showed up the next day.

26:08.866 --> 26:11.001
You know where I was
the next day?

26:12.103 --> 26:13.939
Mr. Mokis?

26:15.006 --> 26:17.241
Moving product on Ewa Beach.

26:19.277 --> 26:21.779
I know Mr. Moki
cared for me.

26:21.813 --> 26:25.049
But I guess I just wasn't
ready to be pushed.

26:26.951 --> 26:28.752
That's why I believe

26:28.787 --> 26:30.922
everyone got to make
their own changes

26:30.955 --> 26:32.324
in their own time.

26:37.162 --> 26:38.963
Brah.

26:38.997 --> 26:40.932
You a good guy.

26:40.965 --> 26:43.902
Doing a good thing.

26:45.170 --> 26:48.707
Sometimes you have
to ask yourself

26:48.740 --> 26:51.142
if you're doing this for him

26:51.175 --> 26:53.077
or for yourself.

26:59.416 --> 27:01.219
<i>Hey, guys, check this out.</i>

27:01.251 --> 27:03.387
I went through the files
on Gwendolines computer...

27:03.421 --> 27:05.056
and I found this.

27:05.089 --> 27:07.826
This is Gwendolines
master sales chart.

27:07.858 --> 27:09.994
The names are people
that Gwendoline

27:10.028 --> 27:11.997
drew commission from,
she recruited them,

27:12.029 --> 27:14.031
and they, in turn,
recruited others.

27:14.065 --> 27:15.700
All right, so what?
She just sits back

27:15.733 --> 27:16.768
and collects checks,
drinks champagne?

27:16.800 --> 27:17.969
That's a lot of people up there.

27:18.002 --> 27:19.738
If it sounds too good
to be true,

27:19.770 --> 27:21.006
that's because it is.

27:21.038 --> 27:22.840
Go on.

27:22.874 --> 27:24.808
Well, when I compare this chart

27:24.843 --> 27:26.411
with the Gwendoline
sellers chart

27:26.443 --> 27:28.946
I got from her boss Jocelyn,

27:28.980 --> 27:30.481
I found some discrepancies.

27:30.515 --> 27:33.852
There are 79 names
that are in Gwendolines chart

27:33.884 --> 27:37.122
that do not appear on the
chart that Jocelyn provided.

27:37.154 --> 27:39.124
Wh-Why would she leave
all these names out?

27:39.156 --> 27:40.825
Because they're not legit.

27:42.027 --> 27:43.961
Yeah, Beth King died
in August of 2015.

27:43.994 --> 27:49.134
Alice Sweeney is an 87-year-old
retiree in Naples, Florida.

27:49.166 --> 27:51.102
Isaiah Norman
just plain doesn't exist.

27:51.135 --> 27:51.903
Okay.

27:51.935 --> 27:54.471
So this isnt just
a Ponzi scheme;

27:54.506 --> 27:56.240
its also a money
laundering scheme.

27:56.273 --> 27:57.909
Jocelyns using dummy accounts

27:57.942 --> 28:00.045
to filter this cash
through the company.

28:00.077 --> 28:01.413
Do we know where the
moneys coming from?

28:01.445 --> 28:02.597
Any idea?

28:02.598 --> 28:03.748
Well, check this out.

28:03.781 --> 28:05.416
Jocelyn and her husband
own titles

28:05.450 --> 28:06.917
to several shell corporations.

28:06.951 --> 28:08.787
All of which have received money

28:08.819 --> 28:11.288
that has been linked to
the Mack Avenue Crew. Oh.

28:11.321 --> 28:13.290
A crime syndicate
out of Detroit.

28:13.324 --> 28:16.060
Let me tell you, this crew,
they aint nothing to play with.

28:16.094 --> 28:17.394
They're involved in everything

28:17.429 --> 28:20.030
from drugs to human trafficking.

28:20.065 --> 28:22.099
That makes sense, I mean,
that would be a reason

28:22.133 --> 28:24.368
that, uh, she would have
gone sour against the company.

28:24.402 --> 28:25.804
Gwendoline was about to

28:25.836 --> 28:27.204
blow the whistle
on this money laundering,

28:27.238 --> 28:29.106
now Jocelyns got
more than enough motive

28:29.140 --> 28:30.407
to want to see her dead.

28:47.057 --> 28:48.460
Doors been breached.

28:48.492 --> 28:50.161
That's never a good thing.

29:16.488 --> 29:18.222
Clear.

29:28.432 --> 29:30.201
Hi.

29:30.234 --> 29:32.202
Looks like they were
getting ready to leave town.

29:32.237 --> 29:34.138
Looks like she left without him.

29:46.416 --> 29:48.552
All right, so we've got
forced entry.

29:48.586 --> 29:51.422
We got half-packed bags,
we got a dead husband upstairs,

29:51.455 --> 29:53.290
and Jocelyn and the two kids
are missing.

29:53.324 --> 29:55.058
Okay, well, it sounds like

29:55.093 --> 29:56.361
someone interrupted
their escape.

29:56.394 --> 29:57.929
The husband tried
to put up a fight,

29:57.961 --> 29:59.263
he got a bullet
for his troubles.

29:59.297 --> 30:01.199
Maybe its that crew
from Detroit.

30:01.231 --> 30:03.367
Well, they do have a
whole bunch of security cameras

30:03.401 --> 30:04.868
in here, so the odds are

30:04.903 --> 30:06.270
they must have
caught something, right?

30:06.304 --> 30:07.105
Hey.

30:07.137 --> 30:09.440
No, she got
the bad-news face on.

30:09.473 --> 30:12.410
Yeah, so I found
Jocelyns computer.

30:12.442 --> 30:14.244
Whoever did this
managed to knock

30:14.278 --> 30:15.579
all the cameras off-line first.

30:15.613 --> 30:18.249
I did, however, find
something else interesting.

30:18.282 --> 30:19.917
So, Jocelyn seems to have forgot

30:19.951 --> 30:21.318
to delete her browser history.

30:21.352 --> 30:23.320
"Foxglove.
What part is poisonous?"

30:23.354 --> 30:25.289
"How to dry foxglove leaves."

30:25.323 --> 30:27.224
Okay. So shes our killer.

30:27.258 --> 30:28.625
Where is she,
and where are her kids?

30:28.660 --> 30:30.094
All right, lets...

30:30.127 --> 30:31.962
lets just pray
they're all still alive.

30:31.996 --> 30:33.597
Presuming that,
why would somebody

30:33.631 --> 30:35.666
keep them alive
and take them with, okay?

30:35.700 --> 30:38.236
It-its because shes got to
have something they want, no?

30:38.269 --> 30:39.704
Shes got their money.

30:39.705 --> 30:41.138
Their money, right?
Shes got to have their money.

30:41.172 --> 30:43.907
Im thinking that crew has eyes
inside this operation here.

30:43.942 --> 30:46.344
Okay, they learn
somethings going wrong.

30:46.376 --> 30:47.377
Gwendolines dead.

30:47.412 --> 30:49.646
Cops are sniffing around.
They're gonna panic.

30:49.681 --> 30:51.449
They're gonna want
to pull that cash out, right?

30:51.481 --> 30:53.284
So they come here,
and what do they find?

30:53.317 --> 30:54.519
Jocelyns getting ready to bail.

30:54.551 --> 30:56.054
Well, if you're right, we need

30:56.086 --> 30:58.056
to figure out where
Jocelyn stashed that cash

30:58.088 --> 30:59.656
before those Detroit
goons do, because...

30:59.691 --> 31:01.358
once they get what they want,

31:01.392 --> 31:03.126
her and her kids are dead.

31:12.237 --> 31:14.372
Hey.

31:16.974 --> 31:19.978
Im sorry, Adam,
but you have to understand.

31:21.445 --> 31:25.516
For a long time,

31:25.549 --> 31:30.622
I fooled myself that no one knew
how bad my drinking was.

31:32.624 --> 31:37.394
Things got bad, then worse.

31:37.427 --> 31:40.230
I was numb

31:40.265 --> 31:43.968
to humiliating myself.

31:44.001 --> 31:45.502
Hurting my friends,

31:45.536 --> 31:48.239
my family.

31:50.375 --> 31:52.676
My marriage failed.

31:54.778 --> 31:57.315
My daughter didn't want me

31:57.347 --> 32:00.384
to walk her down the aisle.

32:03.387 --> 32:05.522
The shame of that.

32:10.094 --> 32:14.565
I decided that my family
would be better off

32:14.598 --> 32:16.567
if Im not in the picture.

32:17.769 --> 32:19.770
I understand.

32:19.804 --> 32:21.271
No, you don't.

32:22.406 --> 32:24.409
What if they don't want me back?

32:27.444 --> 32:28.980
What if they do...

32:30.480 --> 32:33.284
...and you never know

32:33.317 --> 32:36.253
because you were
too afraid to find out?

32:39.824 --> 32:41.459
Hal.

32:43.493 --> 32:45.529
All I know

32:45.563 --> 32:49.666
is that when I hit rock bottom,

32:49.701 --> 32:52.170
some friends

32:52.202 --> 32:55.506
handed me a lifeline

32:55.539 --> 32:57.407
and I took it.

32:57.442 --> 33:01.378
And it was the best decision

33:01.412 --> 33:04.082
I ever made.

33:13.423 --> 33:15.492
<i>Okay, look, if Im gonna stash</i>

33:15.526 --> 33:17.528
millions of dollars
in dirty cash,

33:17.561 --> 33:19.063
Im gonna be wanting a location

33:19.096 --> 33:20.565
that's secure, right?

33:20.597 --> 33:23.367
That has easy access,
good storage, good security.

33:23.401 --> 33:25.103
Somewhere your dog
wouldn't dig it up.

33:25.135 --> 33:27.838
Right, well, I went through
the Greenes financials.

33:27.872 --> 33:29.707
Aside from their primary home,

33:29.740 --> 33:32.076
they own four properties
on the island:

33:32.109 --> 33:33.744
a beachfront estate in Kailua,

33:33.778 --> 33:36.681
a luxury condo
on Halekauwila Place,

33:36.713 --> 33:39.384
a yacht that's docked
in Ala Wai Harbor

33:39.416 --> 33:42.420
and a ranch-style two-bedroom
on Nahua Street.

33:42.452 --> 33:44.255
Look, Im thinking
the money could be stashed

33:44.288 --> 33:46.423
at one or more
of these locations,

33:46.457 --> 33:47.491
so, Danny,
why don't you grab Tani,

33:47.525 --> 33:49.126
hit the last one
and the beach house.

33:49.160 --> 33:50.427
They're in close proximity.

33:50.461 --> 33:51.695
I drive by that condo every day.

33:51.729 --> 33:53.364
You and Lou hit the condo.

33:53.397 --> 33:54.832
Im gonna hit the docks,
all right?

34:10.248 --> 34:11.416
Ill back the truck in.

34:15.652 --> 34:18.289
Hey! Five-O!
Drop your weapon!

34:19.489 --> 34:21.659
No! Get up.

34:21.692 --> 34:23.327
Get up!

34:23.360 --> 34:24.795
You have to save him.

34:24.829 --> 34:26.496
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
Back away.

34:26.530 --> 34:28.364
Back a...
Stay on your knees.

34:28.398 --> 34:30.434
I have 30 minutes to deliver
this cash to these guys,

34:30.467 --> 34:32.570
or they...
they're gonna kill my kids,

34:32.603 --> 34:35.806
and the only person who knows
where they are is him.

34:41.646 --> 34:42.547
So I ran our dead shooter.

34:42.579 --> 34:44.382
His name is Samuel Wade,
and he did time at

34:44.414 --> 34:45.583
Jackson State Prison.

34:45.583 --> 34:46.751
Look, Jerry, we got to find

34:46.784 --> 34:48.686
the rest of this guys
crew right away.

34:48.719 --> 34:49.853
They're holding Jocelyns kids

34:49.887 --> 34:51.621
for ransom right now,
and-and we got

34:51.655 --> 34:52.856
25 minutes to get there,
you understand?

34:52.889 --> 34:54.358
On it.

34:55.393 --> 34:56.626
Okay, here we go.

34:56.661 --> 34:59.864
Wade flew into HNL yesterday
and rented a car.

34:59.896 --> 35:01.632
The reservation
was linked to another.

35:01.666 --> 35:03.333
They're both SUVs, a late-model

35:03.367 --> 35:05.503
GMC Yukon and a Range Rover.

35:05.536 --> 35:06.504
The Yukons here.

35:06.505 --> 35:07.472
Okay, well, rental car companies

35:07.505 --> 35:10.208
usually put vehicle recovery
systems in their cars,

35:10.240 --> 35:12.610
so Ill reach out and find the
Range Rovers exact location.

35:12.643 --> 35:14.644
The second you do...
the second... text us

35:14.679 --> 35:17.215
and the rest of the team, okay?

35:17.248 --> 35:19.483
Okay, what's happening?
We have, like, 20 minutes.

35:19.516 --> 35:22.286
Relax, okay? Hey, I-Im
gonna... Im gonna arrest you

35:22.320 --> 35:23.554
for murder when
this is all over,

35:23.588 --> 35:25.389
but right now we got
to deal with your kids.

35:25.422 --> 35:26.958
I got kids. Ive been
right where you are,

35:26.990 --> 35:29.260
so I understand how you feel.
You got to put that aside,

35:29.293 --> 35:30.628
you need to relax,
and you're gonna help us

35:30.661 --> 35:31.579
find your kids, okay?

35:31.580 --> 35:32.496
Mm-hmm.

35:32.530 --> 35:34.197
Take a breath, relax.

35:36.233 --> 35:37.934
Jerry got a location.

35:37.969 --> 35:39.503
All right, lets find your kids.

35:39.536 --> 35:41.505
Okay.

35:50.014 --> 35:51.449
Get out.

35:54.885 --> 35:55.836
You're late.

35:55.837 --> 35:56.786
By two minutes.
Its kind of hard to drive

35:56.820 --> 35:58.172
with a gun in your ribs.

35:58.173 --> 35:59.523
Wheres the money?

35:59.556 --> 36:00.824
Get it.

36:13.036 --> 36:15.338
Wade.

36:15.373 --> 36:17.340
Lets roll, brother.
What the...

36:34.525 --> 36:37.327
Hey, everything's okay,
all right, guys?

36:37.360 --> 36:38.496
Im here.

36:38.528 --> 36:40.630
Your moms here.
Shes safe.

36:40.664 --> 36:42.500
Everythings gonna be

36:42.532 --> 36:43.668
You okay?

36:45.503 --> 36:48.572
Its all over, kids.
Its all over.

36:48.606 --> 36:50.574
Mama, come on.

36:54.579 --> 36:55.713
Okay, okay, okay.

36:57.547 --> 36:59.483
Mama!

37:08.826 --> 37:10.860
This place looks so beautiful.

37:10.894 --> 37:14.632
Im glad you finally unpacked
all the boxes I helped you move.

37:14.664 --> 37:17.034
You mean those boxes
your guys helped me move?

37:18.068 --> 37:19.936
Supervisor.
Yeah.

37:21.739 --> 37:23.907
Hey.

37:23.940 --> 37:26.510
Thanks for that advice earlier.

37:26.543 --> 37:28.445
I needed to hear it.

37:28.478 --> 37:30.614
Anytime.

37:35.820 --> 37:39.824
Uh...
Hey, everyone, um...

37:43.893 --> 37:48.666
You guys all know, uh, what Ive
been through this past year.

37:50.668 --> 37:52.503
You know, at times,
I-Ive never...

37:52.536 --> 37:54.338
Ive never felt so alone.

37:56.574 --> 37:59.010
Been so aware of

37:59.043 --> 38:01.612
what's missing in my life.

38:03.614 --> 38:06.516
Been so sick to my stomach
with sadness.

38:09.387 --> 38:11.389
And then,

38:11.422 --> 38:15.992
just when I thought
I lost my whole family...

38:16.027 --> 38:20.764
I looked up,
and you were all there.

38:22.967 --> 38:27.605
And you made me... you made me
feel like part of something.

38:29.773 --> 38:30.907
Made me realize

38:30.940 --> 38:33.577
Im-Im not alone,

38:33.610 --> 38:36.547
that I-I do have family.

38:38.882 --> 38:42.452
I just want
to tell you thank you.

38:42.485 --> 38:43.954
Thank you.

38:45.722 --> 38:47.891
To you, buddy. To Adam.

38:47.925 --> 38:48.958
- To Adam.
- Cheers.

38:54.197 --> 38:55.532
Can I eat now?

38:55.565 --> 38:57.001
Yeah.

38:57.034 --> 39:00.003
Excuse me, guys.

39:08.746 --> 39:12.516
Hal. Hey, did-did you get there?

39:12.550 --> 39:13.784
Is everything okay?

39:13.818 --> 39:16.152
Yeah, Im fine,
but theres someone here

39:16.186 --> 39:17.887
who wants to talk to you.

39:19.824 --> 39:22.992
Thank you for sending
my pop-pop home.

39:28.465 --> 39:30.701
You're welcome.

39:30.735 --> 39:32.670
Adam, I don't know

39:32.702 --> 39:35.005
how Ill ever repay you.

39:35.039 --> 39:38.943
You've already helped me

39:38.976 --> 39:42.646
more than you can ever know.

39:45.949 --> 39:47.885
You take care, Hal.

39:47.918 --> 39:50.487
You, too.

40:15.579 --> 40:17.914
Joons, you know, when you said
that we would be spending

40:17.947 --> 40:20.217
the morning on the beach,
I thought wed actually be,

40:20.251 --> 40:21.452
you know, like, lying on it.

40:21.485 --> 40:24.487
O-Okay, well, will you stop
now, okay? Were nearly there.

40:24.521 --> 40:25.523
Wh-What are we doing?

40:25.556 --> 40:27.791
Why does it have to be
this specific patch of sand?

40:27.824 --> 40:29.827
What are we even...

40:34.063 --> 40:37.201
Joons, you did not.

40:37.233 --> 40:38.085
You did not.

40:38.086 --> 40:38.936
Mm-hmm.

40:38.969 --> 40:40.071
No! Oh, my God!

40:40.072 --> 40:41.172
Yeah!

40:41.204 --> 40:42.706
Joons, don't mess with me now!

40:42.739 --> 40:44.574
Im-Im not, Im not.
I promise.

40:44.608 --> 40:47.110
One more thing. Hang on. Okay.

40:47.143 --> 40:48.144
So...

40:48.179 --> 40:50.780
every mermaid needs a tail.

40:50.815 --> 40:52.583
Right?

40:52.615 --> 40:54.717
Oh, my God, you're
kidding me right now.

40:57.320 --> 40:58.889
Seriously?
Yeah.

40:58.922 --> 41:01.858
No.

41:01.891 --> 41:03.327
Im not worthy of this!

41:03.360 --> 41:04.611
Yeah, you're right, yeah.
Give it back.

41:04.612 --> 41:05.862
No, Im wrong! Im so worthy.

41:05.896 --> 41:06.830
St-Stop it already.

41:06.831 --> 41:07.764
You're worthy? Are you sure?

41:07.797 --> 41:08.748
Yes, Im worthy.

41:08.749 --> 41:09.699
Okay, you're worthy.

41:09.733 --> 41:11.068
Joons.

41:12.202 --> 41:13.520
Thank you.

41:13.521 --> 41:14.838
No worries.

41:14.871 --> 41:16.673
Thank you. Oh, my God.

41:21.744 --> 41:22.880
Im glad you're excited.

41:24.748 --> 41:25.832
Yeah, I am.

41:25.833 --> 41:26.916
Uh, so-so you know...

41:26.951 --> 41:29.586
Uh-huh. Okay,
Im recording everything, okay?

41:29.619 --> 41:31.989
Because I will finally
have some leverage over you,

41:32.021 --> 41:33.590
so when you do cross me,

41:33.623 --> 41:35.025
I am blasting this thing
on social media.

41:35.059 --> 41:36.659
I just have to join it first.

41:36.693 --> 41:37.894
I don't care,
do whatever you want.

41:37.927 --> 41:39.730
Im about to crush mermaid camp.

41:39.762 --> 41:40.898
Have fun.

41:40.931 --> 41:44.768
