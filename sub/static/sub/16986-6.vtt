00:32.950 --> 00:36.662
[sighs] Mom, why do we have to gather
wiping leaves in bulk?

00:36.745 --> 00:37.621
Wiping leaves?

00:37.704 --> 00:39.385
I thought we were getting brushing leaves.

00:39.456 --> 00:42.000
Might not want to use
the ones that I got, then.

[cheering]

00:45.712 --> 00:47.923
[grunting]

00:48.006 --> 00:49.591
- Ow!
- Whew!

00:49.675 --> 00:50.926
That was sick!

00:51.009 --> 00:52.803
I feel so alive.

00:52.886 --> 00:54.721
I'm hurt but had fun.

00:54.805 --> 00:59.434
Hey, watch where you're going on those,
uh, I'm gonna go with death rocks.

00:59.518 --> 01:00.852
- [panting]
- [gasps]

01:00.936 --> 01:02.104
Uh, hello.

01:02.187 --> 01:03.772
They're called "slate boards."

01:03.855 --> 01:06.650
They're two parts fun, only one part pain.

01:06.733 --> 01:07.733
Wow!

01:07.776 --> 01:11.363
Most fun things are, like,
one part fun, ten parts pain.

01:11.446 --> 01:13.448
[chuckles]
How do we get one?

01:17.286 --> 01:19.121
[cheering]

01:20.664 --> 01:22.958
[growling]

01:25.419 --> 01:26.419
Two, please.

01:26.461 --> 01:28.130
Well, what do you got to trade?

01:28.755 --> 01:29.755
[flies buzzing]

01:30.173 --> 01:31.883
Uh, these flies.

01:31.967 --> 01:34.469
Sorry.
I got all the flies I need.

01:35.262 --> 01:36.555
[buzzing]

01:37.723 --> 01:42.811
Uh, Mom, Dad, can we have something
to trade for slate boards?

01:42.894 --> 01:44.622
[both] Please, please, please, please,
please, please, please,

01:44.646 --> 01:45.957
please, please, please,
please, please, please!

01:45.981 --> 01:47.899
No. You kids don't need them.

01:47.983 --> 01:49.651
You can injure yourselves for free.

01:49.735 --> 01:51.778
What if we look at you like this?

01:53.030 --> 01:56.992
Sorry, if you wanna waste perfectly
good stuff trading for that junk,

01:57.075 --> 01:58.702
you'll have to find it yourself.

01:58.785 --> 02:00.329
- [groans]
- Oh, no!

02:00.412 --> 02:02.122
I think I'm stuck this way!

02:02.205 --> 02:03.957
[gasps]
There we go.

02:04.750 --> 02:06.293
There's gotta be something to trade,

02:06.376 --> 02:10.213
but all I see are these
worthless sparkle rocks.

02:10.297 --> 02:11.965
Hey, look, an egg.

02:12.716 --> 02:16.803
Ooh, nice try, but we're the best egg
scavengers around. Right, Brother?

02:16.887 --> 02:19.348
"Eggs-actly", Brother.

02:19.431 --> 02:22.476
That was us cracking an imaginary egg,
and it exploding.

02:22.559 --> 02:24.519
Can we have that?

02:24.603 --> 02:27.689
It's our thing. We're gathering eggs
for the coming end of days.

02:27.773 --> 02:29.274
This whole valley's gonna freeze.

02:29.358 --> 02:31.652
But we will have eggs enough to survive.

02:31.735 --> 02:34.154
[laughing]

02:34.237 --> 02:36.615
So, that's a no?

02:36.698 --> 02:39.076
- Gee, those guys are greedy.
- Yeah.

02:39.159 --> 02:41.453
Well, maybe we don't need more stuff.

02:41.536 --> 02:44.706
Slate boards probably aren't as fun
as they look anyway.

02:44.790 --> 02:46.416
Yeah!
[cheering]

02:46.500 --> 02:48.710
This is just as fun as it looks!

02:48.794 --> 02:52.089
Anyone thinking it isn't is wrong!

02:52.172 --> 02:54.841
I know.
We could make our own.

02:54.925 --> 02:56.426
[gasps]
Yeah!

02:56.510 --> 02:59.554
I bet we could build ones
just as good as theirs.

02:59.638 --> 03:00.722
Mm-hmm.

03:01.765 --> 03:04.017
Prepare to feel the rush.

[grunting]

03:15.278 --> 03:16.405
[groaning]

03:17.030 --> 03:20.450
At least this ridiculous number
of egg-shaped rocks broke our fall.

03:20.534 --> 03:24.830
[gasps]
Oh, my bonk!

03:24.913 --> 03:26.540
How can this be?

- [bellowing]
- [gasping]

03:28.250 --> 03:29.918

03:30.001 --> 03:32.504
A moo-ooose!

03:32.587 --> 03:34.172
I've never seen one before.

03:34.256 --> 03:37.217
They're supposed to lay eggs
almost constantly.

03:40.053 --> 03:42.431
[shouts, grunts]

03:44.933 --> 03:46.309
[laughs]

03:46.393 --> 03:48.478
Thunk, we're rich!

03:48.562 --> 03:50.856
[laughing]

03:51.940 --> 03:54.317
[coughs]
I'm drowning.

03:54.401 --> 03:56.945
[hacking]

03:57.279 --> 03:58.697
[sighs]
Thanks.

03:58.780 --> 04:00.907
- Are we still rich?
- Yes.

04:01.450 --> 04:02.576

04:07.205 --> 04:09.791
[laughing]

04:09.875 --> 04:12.127
[screaming, grunting]

04:13.128 --> 04:14.421
Ow!

04:14.504 --> 04:17.339
- Hey.
- Hey.

04:17.423 --> 04:19.968
Wow, those boards are beautiful.

04:21.136 --> 04:24.890
Yeah, we splurged and got slicker rocks
for faster speed

04:24.973 --> 04:27.559
and spider ant webbing for better grip.
[chuckles]

04:27.642 --> 04:30.979
And cool things to stick to them to show
how original we are.

04:31.062 --> 04:33.190
What did you trade to get those?

04:34.357 --> 04:38.403
Yeah, they gave me these eggs,
'cause I love to watch eggs get smashed.

04:39.404 --> 04:41.490
[shouting]

04:41.573 --> 04:43.074
Yeah, I did it!

04:43.158 --> 04:44.659
The eggs got smashed.

04:44.743 --> 04:46.244
Whoo-hoo!

04:47.829 --> 04:52.167
And now, the feelings of regret,
for I have no more eggs to smash.

04:52.250 --> 04:55.003
[gasps]
Man, where'd you get all those?

04:55.086 --> 04:56.797
Well, we were down in this cave...

04:56.880 --> 04:58.298
[shouts, chuckles]

04:58.381 --> 05:00.592
[whispering]
Hey, if more people have eggs,

05:00.675 --> 05:02.969
our eggs will be worth less.

05:03.053 --> 05:05.764
Maybe we should keep this a secret.

05:05.847 --> 05:07.682
[whispering]
Got you.

05:07.766 --> 05:09.100
We stopped eating breakfast.

05:09.184 --> 05:10.352
Well, bye.

05:10.852 --> 05:13.188
[sobbing]

05:15.690 --> 05:17.776
[slurping]

05:20.779 --> 05:23.490
[chortling]

05:29.496 --> 05:30.496
[gulps]

05:34.042 --> 05:37.254
- [panting]
- Put it on full blast.

05:40.799 --> 05:42.384
[grunting]

05:42.717 --> 05:44.553
[yelping]

05:47.180 --> 05:48.014
[sighs]

05:48.098 --> 05:51.851
Now Chest Me can keep an eye
on what's going on under my pelt.

05:54.062 --> 05:55.063
[chuckles]

05:55.146 --> 05:57.232
Thanks for the heads-up, pal.

05:57.315 --> 05:59.526
[Munk humming]

06:01.444 --> 06:02.821
Feet look good as new.

06:02.904 --> 06:04.531
Fabulous, Munksworth.

06:04.614 --> 06:05.907
Keep the change.

06:07.033 --> 06:09.411
Hey, kids, we heard you've
come into some eggs.

06:09.494 --> 06:11.413
What great timing.

06:11.496 --> 06:14.666
Mow is looking to trade
his fancy reclining slab.

06:14.749 --> 06:16.960
[grunting]

06:17.043 --> 06:20.714
Yeah, it looks so comfy.
Can we have some eggs to trade for it?

06:22.799 --> 06:24.676
No. You guys don't need it.

06:24.759 --> 06:26.970
You can recline on the ground for free.

06:27.053 --> 06:29.222
Please?

06:29.306 --> 06:31.099
What if we look at you like this?

06:31.182 --> 06:32.392
[giggling]

06:32.475 --> 06:35.812
[sighing] You guys need to step up
your cute game.

06:35.895 --> 06:41.693
Look, if you wanna waste perfectly good
eggs trading for that junk,

06:41.776 --> 06:43.695
you'll have to find 'em yourself.

06:43.778 --> 06:45.030
But...

06:45.113 --> 06:46.114
Oh... oh.

06:46.197 --> 06:48.116
I see what you did there.

06:48.199 --> 06:49.284
[chuckles]

06:49.367 --> 06:51.911
[Bud] We hear you're in the egg game now.

06:51.995 --> 06:53.788
[Thunk]
Bud, Crud.

06:53.872 --> 06:56.333
Uh... we don't have any eggs.

06:59.294 --> 07:01.254
Uh, I just laid those?

07:01.338 --> 07:02.213
[chuckles]

07:02.297 --> 07:05.008
How can anyone in this valley
have so many eggs

07:05.091 --> 07:07.802
without us knowing
how they got them, Brother?

07:07.886 --> 07:09.679
I think they got a secret, Brother.

07:09.763 --> 07:12.223
An "egg-ceptionally" big one.

07:12.307 --> 07:13.892
Oh, well-played, Brother.

07:13.975 --> 07:16.227
So how do we find out their secret,
Brother?

07:16.311 --> 07:18.438
[groans] Okay, you want eggs?

07:18.521 --> 07:21.483
Here, take this one to leave us alone.

07:21.566 --> 07:24.819
- And stop calling each other "Brother."
- [both] Deal!

07:27.405 --> 07:28.448
[shudders]

07:28.531 --> 07:32.452
Man, Bud and Crud sure are
a few skulls short of a bone pit, huh?

07:32.535 --> 07:34.996
Yeah, it's like
everyone wants our eggs.

07:35.080 --> 07:37.666
Yeah.
Well, they're safe here.

07:37.749 --> 07:41.002
I mean, only we know about this place
and we can trust each other, right?

07:41.086 --> 07:42.504
- [chuckles]
- Of course.

07:44.214 --> 07:47.384
[laughing nervously]

07:47.467 --> 07:52.806
Okay, uh, so we have 444 eggs left.

07:52.889 --> 07:55.600
Uh, didn't we have 446 earlier?

07:55.684 --> 07:59.229
Yeah, but then we traded two
for that funky hat.

08:01.690 --> 08:03.650
If you say so.

08:03.733 --> 08:06.945
[gasps]
Oh, Moosey laid five more eggs.

08:07.028 --> 08:08.238
Five?

08:08.321 --> 08:09.823
Last time, she laid six.

08:09.906 --> 08:11.491
You sure there's not another one?

08:11.574 --> 08:14.744
Hey, what's that behind your back?

08:14.828 --> 08:16.496
Oh, just another hat. Why?

08:16.579 --> 08:18.123
What's that behind your back?

08:18.206 --> 08:20.458
The third kind of hat we got.

08:20.542 --> 08:21.835
That looks great on you.

08:22.627 --> 08:25.088
Sorry.
Bud and Crud really got to me.

08:25.171 --> 08:27.632
- [sighs] Let's go home.
- Sounds good.

08:27.716 --> 08:29.092
After you.

08:29.175 --> 08:30.760
No, after you.

08:30.844 --> 08:32.595
I insist, after you.

08:32.679 --> 08:35.347
No, after you.

08:35.890 --> 08:38.768
[growling]

08:39.184 --> 08:40.395
You two seem tense.

08:40.477 --> 08:43.313
What you need is a nice, relaxing recline.

08:43.398 --> 08:45.400
[whispering]
Hey, don't overdo it.

08:45.483 --> 08:47.861
Just be cool.
Just play it cool.

08:50.030 --> 08:52.907
[Eep and Thunk growling]

08:53.450 --> 08:57.328
[Thunk] Eep, are you gone
or are your eyes just closed?

08:57.412 --> 08:58.621
Uh-oh.

08:59.706 --> 09:01.791
[grunts]

09:01.875 --> 09:02.876
[sighs]

09:03.877 --> 09:06.004
A-ha! Caught you egg-handed!

09:06.087 --> 09:07.172
I caught you!

09:07.255 --> 09:10.091
You only caught me coming here
to stop you.

09:10.175 --> 09:11.885
You can't fool me.

09:11.968 --> 09:14.971
Now that you've had a taste of this
high-class egg life,

09:15.055 --> 09:17.182
you want 'em all for yourself.

09:17.265 --> 09:20.185
You've probably got eggs stuffed
in your pelt right now.

09:21.352 --> 09:24.064
Ha! I'm the innocent one here.

09:24.939 --> 09:27.192
- [gasps, chuckles]
- [moo-ooose bellows]

09:28.985 --> 09:31.988
Told you they had a moo-ooose, Brother.

09:32.072 --> 09:34.282
But now they don't
'cause it's ours, Brother.

09:34.365 --> 09:35.365
- [screaming]
- [bellowing]

09:35.408 --> 09:37.035
We'll see about that, Brother.

09:37.118 --> 09:39.746
- [groans]
- Sorry. It's kinda contagious.

09:39.829 --> 09:42.123
[panting]

09:42.207 --> 09:43.291
Brother, Brother...

09:45.293 --> 09:46.878
[shouts]

09:46.961 --> 09:49.464
Hang on, Moosey!

09:49.547 --> 09:50.840
Mama's coming.

09:50.924 --> 09:52.842
So is Uncle Thunkster.

09:52.926 --> 09:56.387
If you're the mom, I cannot be the dad,
it'd be weird.

09:56.471 --> 09:58.681
[panting]

10:02.477 --> 10:04.187
[pants]
Almost got 'em.

10:04.562 --> 10:08.149
Uh-oh. We really should've gotten
slate boards with slowy-downers.

10:09.734 --> 10:11.903
[shouting]

10:11.986 --> 10:13.988
[grunting]

10:16.324 --> 10:17.700
[all]
No!

10:20.829 --> 10:21.829
[all sighing]

10:24.207 --> 10:25.708
[bellowing]

10:32.298 --> 10:33.633
[both]
Mine, Brother!

10:33.716 --> 10:35.301
I deserve it more, Brother.

10:35.385 --> 10:37.512
I deserve it more...

10:37.595 --> 10:40.765
I have no brother!

10:40.849 --> 10:42.016
[thuds]

10:42.100 --> 10:43.726
[both]
Oh, brother.

10:43.810 --> 10:46.521
Ah, hey, I like eggs,

10:46.604 --> 10:50.191
but I don't want to end up
like those greedy weirdos.

10:50.275 --> 10:52.861
Yeah, there's more to life
than eggs, after all.

10:52.944 --> 10:54.112
Like hats.

10:54.195 --> 10:57.198
Hey, we still got some eggs left.

10:57.282 --> 10:59.617
Yeah, but we don't need
any more stuff.

10:59.701 --> 11:03.371
Let's give Mom and Dad what they've
always wanted deep down.

11:04.372 --> 11:06.416
Whoo-hoo!
Yeah!

11:06.499 --> 11:07.417
You were right, kids.

11:07.500 --> 11:09.544
This is better than sitting on a rock.

11:09.627 --> 11:11.254
[laughing]

11:12.130 --> 11:13.131
[grunts]

11:15.842 --> 11:18.595
And they're not the only ones
we made happy.

11:18.678 --> 11:20.388
Yeah!

11:20.471 --> 11:21.472
Whoo-hoo!

11:21.556 --> 11:24.225
The eggs are gonna get smashed!

11:26.102 --> 11:28.855
[cackling]

11:30.481 --> 11:33.276
It's never as good as the first smash.

11:34.360 --> 11:36.279
[music playing]

11:41.367 --> 11:43.411
[overlapping chatter]

11:46.706 --> 11:49.459
Finally an angry mob is going after Snoot.

11:49.542 --> 11:51.711
But none of my other wishes came true.

11:51.794 --> 11:52.980
[Munk] Snoot's throwing a party.

11:53.004 --> 11:55.131
There's lots of food
and everyone's invited.

11:55.214 --> 11:56.299
Even me.

11:56.382 --> 11:58.092
[laughs]
What was he thinking?

11:59.135 --> 12:00.845
And what did you bring?

12:00.929 --> 12:03.348
Oh! Giant egg.

12:03.431 --> 12:05.892
[sniffs] Is that home-laid?

12:05.975 --> 12:09.687
- [laughs]
- A party where people share food?

12:09.771 --> 12:11.731
Well, I'll try anything once.

12:11.814 --> 12:13.483
Never trust free food.

12:13.566 --> 12:16.986
Last time I did, I ended up married.

12:17.070 --> 12:20.239
Oh, Mom,
you never trust anything.

12:20.323 --> 12:23.242
You told Thunk that hugs are traps.

12:23.326 --> 12:25.036
Hugs are traps.

12:25.119 --> 12:26.663
They pin your arms.

12:26.746 --> 12:28.122
Right. No hugs.

12:28.206 --> 12:30.625
- Smiling is dangerous.
- Darn right.

12:30.708 --> 12:35.964
The sun's too hot, the flowers are too
smelly, and that pigrat's too ugly.

12:36.881 --> 12:37.924
[cooing]

12:38.007 --> 12:40.259
Hmm. Too sensitive, too.

12:40.343 --> 12:43.846
Uh-huh.
Well, have fun hating everything.

12:43.930 --> 12:45.932
We'll be over here ignoring you.

12:46.015 --> 12:48.017
You call that a blow-off?

12:48.101 --> 12:51.312
- Ha! Even the pigrat did it better.
- [pigrat coos]

12:55.024 --> 12:57.276
They're the ones with problems.

12:57.360 --> 12:59.195
I'm just pointing them out.

12:59.278 --> 13:02.865
[Amber] Stop yappin' or Amber eat you,
crabby pest.

13:02.949 --> 13:04.158
Oh, yeah?

13:04.242 --> 13:07.412
Good luck tryin',
'cause this gal's all gristle.

13:07.495 --> 13:10.707
Uh, Amber talking to crabby tabby.

13:10.790 --> 13:15.712
Although Amber not mind if old crabby lady
take it down a notch too.

13:15.795 --> 13:19.841
Crabby tabby howl outside
Amber cave all day.

13:19.924 --> 13:23.636
Now be quiet inside Amber's belly.

13:24.387 --> 13:25.722
It was right to howl.

13:25.805 --> 13:27.223
Your cave's ugly.

13:27.306 --> 13:29.183
[both howling]

13:30.101 --> 13:31.978
Okay. You both horrible.

13:33.312 --> 13:35.523
Nobody else appreciates us.

13:35.606 --> 13:38.276

- [growling]

13:38.359 --> 13:39.360
[purring]

13:39.444 --> 13:41.195
I like you.

13:41.279 --> 13:44.115
We crabby types gotta stick together.

13:44.198 --> 13:49.620
How would they know how terrible things
are if we didn't tell 'em?

13:49.704 --> 13:51.706
So come on, girls.

13:51.789 --> 13:55.168
- Let's go gripe at 'em.
- [meowing]

13:55.251 --> 13:56.586
But first a nap.

14:03.301 --> 14:05.344
Hi. We're here for the party.

14:05.428 --> 14:06.637
[overlapping chatter]

14:06.721 --> 14:09.599
The food party...

14:09.682 --> 14:12.935
that's in your cave right now.

14:13.019 --> 14:15.188
I have no idea what you're talking about.

14:15.271 --> 14:16.856
Party! Food party!

14:16.939 --> 14:19.275
Inside Snoot's cave right now!

14:19.359 --> 14:22.445
- [cheering]
- Come on. Everyone else is here.

14:22.528 --> 14:24.155
Not everyone.

14:24.238 --> 14:27.492
Not you, and not...

14:27.575 --> 14:29.327
that guy over there.

14:29.410 --> 14:31.204
Darn sky bunnies!

14:31.287 --> 14:34.248
- I'm gonna eat ya!
- Oh, wait, that's Gorp.

14:34.332 --> 14:38.086
[chuckles] Gorp, stop yelling at the sky
and come party, you goof.

14:39.462 --> 14:41.464
That guy.
Where was I?

14:41.547 --> 14:43.257
You know where you were.

14:43.341 --> 14:44.675
Fine. I do.

14:44.759 --> 14:47.887
But I was trying to be polite
before I do this.

14:47.970 --> 14:49.847
[howling]
It hurts!

14:49.931 --> 14:51.641
It hurts so much!

14:51.724 --> 14:52.767
[grunting]

14:52.850 --> 14:54.519
Grug, your hand!

14:54.602 --> 14:58.481
No, not that.
Being rejected by Snoot!

14:58.564 --> 15:02.276
[growls] We're so finding a way
into that party.

15:02.360 --> 15:03.611
[grunts]
Ow!

15:03.694 --> 15:05.905
Okay, yeah, you know what?
This hurts, too.

15:06.906 --> 15:10.451
Here, but that is the last time
I'm doing your homework for you.

15:10.535 --> 15:11.828
- [meowing]
- [sighs]

15:11.911 --> 15:13.371
Hey, we caught those.

15:18.000 --> 15:20.711
[groans]
Crabby tabbies are the worst.

15:20.795 --> 15:23.840
[grunts] No, you're the worst,
whoever said that.

15:23.923 --> 15:26.134
Don't know who you are,
but you're definitely the worst.

15:26.217 --> 15:27.301
[Eep and Thunk]
Gran?

15:27.385 --> 15:28.553
Oh, it's you.

15:28.636 --> 15:29.804
I take it back.

15:29.887 --> 15:30.972
You're not half bad.

15:31.055 --> 15:33.307
What are you doing with these jerks?

15:33.391 --> 15:35.977
- [hissing]
- Those jerks are my friends.

15:36.978 --> 15:38.813
Oh... associates.

15:38.896 --> 15:41.816
Well, your associates really
don't like being hugged.

15:41.899 --> 15:45.987
I don't know who's a worse influence
on who, but this can't be good.

15:46.070 --> 15:47.572
Sure it can.

15:47.655 --> 15:49.574
We're sick of being mistreated.

15:49.657 --> 15:51.993
One crabby alone is a pest,

15:52.076 --> 15:55.788
but many crabbies together
are pests that can't be denied!

15:55.872 --> 15:56.914
[meowing]

15:56.998 --> 15:59.083
Crabbiness gets you what you want.

15:59.167 --> 16:01.544
Isn't there anything you want?

16:01.627 --> 16:03.421
Besides this tabby off my face?

16:04.297 --> 16:06.174
Actually...

16:07.008 --> 16:08.801
What do you mean
you don't have my dinner?

16:08.885 --> 16:10.470
I mean, your homework.

16:10.553 --> 16:12.388
Oh, who am I kidding?
My dinner!

16:12.472 --> 16:15.975
Sorry, Teacher Squawk, but a crabby tabby
ate it before you could.

16:16.851 --> 16:17.894
[growling]

16:17.977 --> 16:19.812
So you're going to Deep Trouble.

16:20.396 --> 16:22.148
Oh, no, you don't.

16:22.231 --> 16:23.983

Wow!

16:30.907 --> 16:32.283

16:32.366 --> 16:33.284

Yeah!

16:33.367 --> 16:36.746
Ha! Thanks to no more
Miss Nice Gran.

16:36.829 --> 16:38.873
There was a Miss Nice Gran?

16:42.210 --> 16:46.088
Okay, so we dig inside,
then eat anything we can grab.

16:46.172 --> 16:48.174
Don't chew. It'll only slow you down.

found my indoor watering hole.

16:55.598 --> 16:57.558
You're also not invited to use that.

16:57.642 --> 16:59.644
[screaming, grunting]

16:59.727 --> 17:01.145
Ow!

17:02.230 --> 17:05.441
Oh, man, this is gonna take forever.

17:19.372 --> 17:21.332

17:21.915 --> 17:24.460
No. That's garbage fruit.

17:24.544 --> 17:26.002
He's holding out on us.

17:26.087 --> 17:27.128
Come on.

17:27.213 --> 17:28.756

17:28.839 --> 17:29.839

17:35.596 --> 17:37.515
- [panting]
- Much better.

17:40.059 --> 17:44.355
Gee, it's hard to eat
with him looking so sad.

17:44.438 --> 17:46.148
You're right.

- [overlapping chatter]

18:05.918 --> 18:08.045
Well, Gran was right.

18:08.129 --> 18:13.092
Crabbiness did make people treat us
better by treating them worse.

18:13.175 --> 18:15.720
- Hmm.
- Did someone say Gran was right?

18:15.803 --> 18:17.555
Missed the rest.

18:17.638 --> 18:20.600
Welcome to your new home, girls.

18:20.683 --> 18:22.602
Food's under the rock,
sleep pile's there

18:22.685 --> 18:25.605

that's not the poo corner.

18:25.688 --> 18:27.023
Oh, what am I saying?

18:27.106 --> 18:28.733
It's your home, too.

18:28.816 --> 18:31.110
- I don't make the rules.
- What?

18:31.193 --> 18:33.738
No, no, no.
The tabbies can't live here.

18:33.821 --> 18:36.407
They keep using me as a scratching post.

18:36.490 --> 18:38.951
And that one keeps staring at me
when it licks its butt.

18:41.871 --> 18:43.914
- Nah, sorry, Gran, but they gotta go.
- [meowing]

18:43.998 --> 18:45.541

who will you be crabby to then, huh?

19:02.183 --> 19:03.559
No one, that's who.

19:03.643 --> 19:05.728
Or maybe someone else
I haven't thought of.

19:07.229 --> 19:09.523
They just don't understand us, Winky.

Oh, why did I give you all rhyming names?

19:17.073 --> 19:20.284
Really, Croods,
you thought I'd fall for this?

19:20.368 --> 19:22.662
Stay out!

Man, if that's the food
they're throwing away,

Whoa, we're sad that we don't get
to spend time with Snoot?

22:02.238 --> 22:04.281
- That's a new feeling.
- Yeah, I know.

22:04.365 --> 22:06.617
I just wanna know why he didn't invite us.

22:06.700 --> 22:09.411
It's not like our family
is smelly or weird or...

22:09.495 --> 22:11.330
[hissing]

22:16.001 --> 22:19.505
Snuggle 'em all
and let somebody else sort 'em out!

22:19.588 --> 22:21.757
I thought I told you Croods...

22:22.675 --> 22:25.302
Okay, who brought the crabby tabbies?

22:25.386 --> 22:26.929
You know I'm allergic to shellfish.

22:27.012 --> 22:29.098
[shouts]
Oh, no!

22:29.181 --> 22:30.015
- [Snoot screaming]
- Right.

22:30.099 --> 22:32.226
And that is why
we don't get invited anywhere.

22:32.309 --> 22:33.769
What are you talking about?

22:33.852 --> 22:36.647
Crabby tabbies are the purr-fect guests.

22:36.730 --> 22:37.815
[laughs]

22:37.898 --> 22:38.983
[hacking]

22:39.567 --> 22:41.944
Never mind.
They're terrible.
