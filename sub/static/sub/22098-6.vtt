00:24.400 --> 00:26.359
Deep down in that thing
you call a subconscious,

00:26.443 --> 00:29.028
you know how many Cylons
there are left in the fleet.

00:29.113 --> 00:30.738

ZAREK: Glad to see you,
Madam President.

00:41.041 --> 00:44.836
Well, Mr. Zarek. It would seem
the enemy of my enemy is my friend.

00:48.424 --> 00:49.674
Go find Earth.

00:54.012 --> 00:55.221
Let's go home.

00:59.101 --> 01:00.685
ROSLIN:
We have found Kobol.

01:00.811 --> 01:04.439
And when we retrieve the Arrow,
we will open the Tomb of Athena

01:04.523 --> 01:06.691
and we will find
the road to Earth.

01:07.276 --> 01:09.318
No one's gonna
believe this crap.

01:09.486 --> 01:13.281
And anyone that wants to make a
suicide run to Kobol, let them.

Twenty-four ships, sir.

01:21.081 --> 01:22.957
That's almost
a third of the fleet.

01:23.500 --> 01:26.335
They're gonna follow Roslin
to Kobol to their death.

Roslin's rebellion, sir.

01:53.697 --> 01:55.990
Not who. What.

01:56.617 --> 01:59.118
I'm not interested in
people who decide to join up

01:59.203 --> 02:01.537
with a religious fanatic
and a terrorist.

02:01.914 --> 02:04.749
That's their business.
Now, what have I lost?

02:05.000 --> 02:09.086
(SIGHING) 12 transports, seven
freighters, three construction platforms,

02:09.171 --> 02:11.380
a private cruiser
and a mining ship, sir.

02:11.757 --> 02:13.174
The Monarch was a blow.

02:13.258 --> 02:16.511
We can't afford to lose mining
ships, not in our situation.

02:16.595 --> 02:19.138
And then there's
the collateral damage.

02:19.223 --> 02:21.098
Morale is down
throughout the fleet.

02:21.183 --> 02:24.477
The press is going wild,
families are being split apart...

02:24.561 --> 02:26.896
Don't talk to me
about family.

02:28.482 --> 02:31.192
APOLLO: I support
the president completely.

02:31.276 --> 02:35.071
And my only priorities are
the preservation of her safety

02:35.155 --> 02:36.864
and the completion
of this mission.

02:36.949 --> 02:39.408
That's all well and good,
but he's still Adama's son.

02:39.493 --> 02:40.493
MAN: Yeah!
WOMAN: Yes!

02:40.577 --> 02:43.538
When push comes to shove, how do we
know he'll be willing to stand up...

02:43.622 --> 02:46.624
If it were not for him, I would
still be in a Galactica jail cell.

02:46.708 --> 02:51.128
I trust him completely
and this subject is closed.

02:51.213 --> 02:52.588
And what about Galactica?

02:52.673 --> 02:54.507
They know where we are.

02:54.591 --> 02:57.677
They could jump in here at any
time and charge us all with treason

02:57.761 --> 02:59.762
or destroy this ship
with a flick of the wrist.

02:59.847 --> 03:02.056
ZAREK: We're not
entirely defenseless.

03:02.140 --> 03:04.350
Some of our ships
are armed.

03:04.601 --> 03:07.395
We should take steps to arm
the others, just in case.

03:07.479 --> 03:08.521
(ALL ARGUING)

03:08.605 --> 03:11.315
Just in case we want
to commit suicide.

03:13.443 --> 03:17.154
If Galactica wants to take us down,
there is nothing we can do about it.

03:17.239 --> 03:18.322
Nothing.

03:18.407 --> 03:22.410
And nobody in this room should be
under any illusions on that count.

03:23.829 --> 03:27.331
At this point, it's my firm belief
that Cdr. Adama has let us go.

03:27.416 --> 03:30.543
Lt. Thrace will return.

03:31.044 --> 03:33.546
She will have
the Arrow of Apollo

03:33.630 --> 03:36.549
and it will help us
find our way to Earth.

03:36.633 --> 03:39.635
And exactly how long
should we wait for her?

03:39.720 --> 03:42.054
I mean, maybe we should
go down to the surface now.

03:42.139 --> 03:44.056
Go down now and start
looking for this tomb.

03:44.141 --> 03:46.726
I wouldn't be too eager. There
may still be Cylons present.

03:46.810 --> 03:49.312
And some of us
will die down there.

03:57.696 --> 04:00.531
The scriptures tell us
that any return to Kobol

04:01.116 --> 04:02.825
carries with it a cost

04:02.910 --> 04:04.076
in blood.

04:06.413 --> 04:07.538

04:08.081 --> 04:12.084
I realize that there are still
many unanswered questions here.

04:12.377 --> 04:15.296
But I refuse to lose sight of
what this has always been about:

04:15.380 --> 04:18.049
Our mission
to save humanity.

04:18.425 --> 04:20.176
Yes, it's a big one.

04:21.178 --> 04:23.095
But it is our
foretold destiny

04:23.180 --> 04:27.141
and I, for one, am not
going to waver from it now.

04:30.520 --> 04:34.732
If there is anyone here who does not
have the stomach for this mission,

04:34.816 --> 04:37.777

04:54.711 --> 04:58.089
It's either a Cylon vessel, or
it's a Raptor scout from Galactica.

a statement, please.

of friends lost.

14:05.929 --> 14:08.347
And the resources
we've sacrificed

14:08.431 --> 14:10.724

the coordinates,

the whereabouts of
President Roslin's rebellion?

14:38.962 --> 14:41.088
Do you intend to put
the fleet back together?

14:41.339 --> 14:44.550
First of all, Laura Roslin
is no longer president.

14:45.468 --> 14:49.972
She relinquished that role when she
suborned mutiny aboard this ship.

14:50.056 --> 14:51.223
Next question.

answered my question yet.

to remain with us.

Remind me not
to do that again.

15:57.915 --> 16:00.375
Always looked easy enough
when Roslin did it.

16:07.050 --> 16:11.053
There was an old footbridge
over the Euclid River.

16:13.723 --> 16:17.184
I used to go there
when I was a boy.

16:19.562 --> 16:22.105

and swim upstream.

16:22.732 --> 16:24.608
They were mesmerizing.

unaware as they were
of the

16:32.950 --> 16:35.911
wider complexities,
challenges of life.

You're beginning to see
human beings as we see them.

What I am beginning to see are
Cylon faces, everywhere I look.

Sharon told me there were
eight Cylons left in the fleet.

16:53.429 --> 16:55.305
Why didn't I ask her
who they were?

16:56.057 --> 16:57.599
If that idiot
hadn't shot her.

don't they?

They?

17:15.368 --> 17:18.120
Why are you talking to me
like I'm not one of them?

17:18.579 --> 17:20.247
In some ways,
you never were.

17:20.832 --> 17:21.915
You have a path.

17:21.999 --> 17:23.792
You will be spared
their fate.

For once, Gaius, you can stop manipulating
the world and let destiny take its course.

If there's one thing we know
about human beings with certainty,

17:35.471 --> 17:38.056
they are masters
of self-destruction.

17:51.988 --> 17:53.780
Because I love him.

17:53.906 --> 17:55.949
And because
I'm carrying his child.

17:56.284 --> 17:58.577
Oh, I see,
that explains it.

17:58.661 --> 18:00.912
You're not here because
you mean us any harm,

18:00.997 --> 18:04.166
or because you're a
programmed enemy of humanity.

18:04.333 --> 18:08.420
You're here because you had an
affair with one of our Raptor pilots.

18:08.504 --> 18:10.464
Listen to me.
I'm listening to you.

18:10.548 --> 18:13.341
That's my mistake.
I'm listening to a Cylon.

18:14.677 --> 18:17.012
I am here because
I chose to come here.

18:18.139 --> 18:19.806
And I know
you don't believe me.

18:20.516 --> 18:23.518
But hear this,
even if you find the Tomb,

18:24.604 --> 18:28.064
even if you find the map,
and even if you find Earth,

18:28.149 --> 18:30.025
the price you pay
will be too high.

18:30.109 --> 18:31.610
I'm not interested
in your prophecies.

18:31.694 --> 18:35.655
I know that there is a Cylon force
on Kobol. I know it's dangerous.

18:35.740 --> 18:38.700
And I have little doubt that you
are communicating everything I say

18:38.785 --> 18:39.826
even as we speak.

18:39.911 --> 18:42.370
It doesn't work like that.
I'm not wired in.

18:42.455 --> 18:43.747
Sharon, it's simple.

18:44.457 --> 18:48.084
What I need to know and
what might keep you alive,

18:48.753 --> 18:52.380
is exactly how to find
the Tomb of Athena.

18:53.424 --> 18:54.800
Get me a map

18:54.884 --> 18:57.969
and I will do my best to tell
you how to get to the Tomb.

18:58.054 --> 18:59.846
No, you'll do better
than your best.

18:59.931 --> 19:03.266
I want to know where it is and
you either know or you don't.

19:06.437 --> 19:08.438
We all know about the Tomb.

19:08.898 --> 19:10.899
I can show you the path.

19:11.067 --> 19:13.610
I don't know how long the path
is, or exactly where it leads to,

19:13.694 --> 19:16.404
but I can tell you that you're gonna
have to move very, very quickly.

19:22.578 --> 19:25.247
She claims to love
Lt. Agathon.

19:25.748 --> 19:28.250
She says she loves
the baby she's carrying.

19:28.668 --> 19:30.919
Who cares what she says?

19:31.337 --> 19:33.380
You can't believe a word,
any of them.

19:33.464 --> 19:35.549
The scrolls of Pythia
do speak of a lower demon

19:35.633 --> 19:37.425
who helped the people
in a time of crisis.

19:37.510 --> 19:38.760
More superstition.

19:40.596 --> 19:44.015
I've told her that unless we return
from Kobol with a map to Earth,

19:44.100 --> 19:48.436
that Lt. Agathon will be put out
the airlock as a Cylon conspirator.

19:50.690 --> 19:52.148
Is that true?

19:52.275 --> 19:54.609
Doesn't matter if it's
true. She believed it.

19:55.945 --> 19:58.530
She saved them, both of
them. She didn't have to.

19:58.906 --> 20:02.158
She could've saved her child
and let them die. Why didn't she?

20:02.743 --> 20:05.912
Because I believe that she's
telling the truth about one thing,

20:05.997 --> 20:07.956
she thinks she's in love.

20:08.040 --> 20:11.167
Even if it's software instead
of an emotion, it's real to her.

20:11.252 --> 20:14.671
She wants her baby to live.
She wants Agathon to live.

20:15.965 --> 20:17.382
We use that.

20:35.735 --> 20:38.737
This is not the way that I
thought things were gonna go down.

20:39.822 --> 20:42.407
I knew they'd
be suspicious, but...

20:46.579 --> 20:47.829
They're human,

20:50.750 --> 20:52.459
the way you are.

20:56.339 --> 20:58.006
Has anyone stopped
to consider

20:58.090 --> 21:02.093
that the reason Sharon knows so much
about Kobol is because it's a Cylon trap?

21:02.178 --> 21:03.720
I've done more
than consider it.

21:03.804 --> 21:06.014
It is clearly possible
we're facing a trap.

21:06.432 --> 21:08.516
Capt. Apollo has
already warned us that

21:08.601 --> 21:10.769
Cylon encounter in
the region is probable.

21:10.853 --> 21:14.481
Has Capt. Apollo managed to tell
us anything we don't already know?

21:15.608 --> 21:17.651
He is in charge
of this mission.

21:17.735 --> 21:19.778
He is second in command
only to myself.

21:19.862 --> 21:22.989
I strongly encourage you
to remember that, Mr. Meier.

21:30.539 --> 21:34.709
Whatever the risks, whatever the
consequences, I am going anyway.

21:37.171 --> 21:38.713
I am committed.

I know how you feel,
I get it.

24:28.884 --> 24:31.344
But I didn't shoot him,
okay? It wasn't me.

24:32.638 --> 24:34.430
You're all the same.

24:37.726 --> 24:40.228
You don't know what the hell
you're talking about.

24:41.564 --> 24:43.690
Then maybe
I'm done talking.

24:45.901 --> 24:48.570
I think there's been
enough of that today.

24:55.244 --> 24:58.246
You are the last one that
should be telling me what to do

24:58.330 --> 24:59.914
after the stunt
you pulled.

24:59.999 --> 25:03.459
Stealing the Cylon Raider and
then tearing ass back to Caprica?

25:04.420 --> 25:08.256
Yeah, I guess you're clearly the
poster boy for military discipline, huh?

25:08.632 --> 25:12.468
You know what, you have no idea
what happened to me on Caprica.

25:13.429 --> 25:17.390
So while you're standing here polishing
off your halo, consider for a second

25:17.474 --> 25:21.102
that you may not have any damned idea
what the hell you're talking about,

25:22.188 --> 25:23.438
Captain.

25:28.903 --> 25:32.197
MEIER: What Roslin's doing is
reckless. We have our own fleet now.

25:32.281 --> 25:34.782
How much longer do we need to
keep playing follow the leader?

25:34.867 --> 25:38.661
We have a fleet because people believe
Roslin's going to lead them to Earth.

25:38.787 --> 25:39.996
She's a fraud.

25:40.080 --> 25:41.873
You don't believe her,
do you?

25:41.957 --> 25:44.626
No, but I believe
in the power of myth.

25:46.337 --> 25:48.963
I'm not interested in risking
our lives any more than you are,

25:49.048 --> 25:52.008
but she's clearly not
gonna be talked out of this.

25:52.134 --> 25:55.303
And in the end, president or
prophet, it doesn't really matter.

25:55.429 --> 25:59.432
She still needs a commander,
a man in charge of the fleet.

26:00.309 --> 26:03.102
The man with the guns
makes the rules.

26:05.231 --> 26:08.149
What if she decides you're not the
man to be in charge of the fleet?

26:09.568 --> 26:11.945
What if she has
someone else in mind?

26:12.488 --> 26:15.949
Someone already close to her,
like a certain captain?

26:18.202 --> 26:21.329
Let's say you're right,
that on some level,

26:21.830 --> 26:24.290
based on their belief
in the scriptures,

26:24.375 --> 26:27.669
the fleet needs Laura Roslin
in order to stay in line.

26:28.963 --> 26:32.966
So we do what we must in order to keep
Roslin safe on the surface of Kobol.

26:33.884 --> 26:35.051
But...

26:35.886 --> 26:37.095
But?

26:40.182 --> 26:41.474
You're right.
