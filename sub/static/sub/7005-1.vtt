WEBVTT

00:01.867 --> 00:03.768
Hi, guys.
Hi, mom.

00:03.769 --> 00:05.070
Hi, mom.
Hi, mom.

00:05.071 --> 00:07.172
I picked up my suit
for the wedding.

00:07.173 --> 00:09.908
Now I have to figure out
what you guys are gonna
be wearing.

00:09.909 --> 00:14.513
We'd be wearing a big smile
if we didn't have to go.

00:14.514 --> 00:16.748
I'm the only one of my sisters
who can make it.

00:16.749 --> 00:18.817
We have to represent
the patterson girls.

00:18.818 --> 00:21.620
A lifelong dream of mine.

00:21.621 --> 00:23.688
Oh, come on.
It's gonna be fun.

00:23.689 --> 00:25.423
It's gonna be torture.

00:25.424 --> 00:28.426
We'll be near one of the best
water-skiing lakes
in michigan,

00:28.427 --> 00:31.429
And we'll be stuck
with our boring relatives
the whole time.

00:31.430 --> 00:33.665
My relatives aren't boring.

00:33.666 --> 00:36.434
They're odd.

00:36.435 --> 00:39.371
But that's
what makes them fun.

00:39.372 --> 00:41.205
Mom, what sounds
like more fun -

00:41.206 --> 00:45.077
Water-skiing
or watching aunt edna
take out her teeth?

00:45.078 --> 00:47.244
They're both fun.

00:47.245 --> 00:50.882
If we can fit in any vacation
while we're up in traverse city,
that's great,

00:50.883 --> 00:53.084
But your father and I
have already agreed

00:53.085 --> 00:55.252
That this trip is about
my cousin's wedding.

00:55.253 --> 00:57.388
Hey, hey, guys!

01:00.793 --> 01:02.561
All right.
Cool, boogie boards.

01:02.562 --> 01:04.328
What is all that?

01:04.330 --> 01:07.532
Stuff I borrowed
for the wedding.

01:07.533 --> 01:10.568
And do you plan
to use the boogie board

01:10.569 --> 01:13.338
For the ceremony
or the reception?

01:13.339 --> 01:17.175
I'll just wait to see
what everyone else is doing.

01:17.176 --> 01:20.178
Wow! This is gonna be
a really cool wedding.

01:20.179 --> 01:22.680
Not only that, al's going
up to wilson's cabin.

01:22.681 --> 01:25.417
They're gonna do
some fly-fishing.
We can join those guys.

01:25.418 --> 01:27.986
If there's time,
water-skiing and off-roading.

01:27.987 --> 01:30.288
Rad!
Cool. Off-roading?
That'd be awesome.

01:30.289 --> 01:33.825
There's not gonna be
any time for all that.
Here, guys. You do this.

01:33.826 --> 01:35.793
How much time
does a wedding take?

01:35.794 --> 01:39.097
It's "I do," "I do,"
you cut the cake,
we're on the lake.

01:39.098 --> 01:40.998
No, there's not
just the wedding.

01:40.999 --> 01:43.802
We got the family barbecue,
rehearsal dinner, rehearsal.

01:43.803 --> 01:46.805
And don't forget aunt edna's
surprise birthday brunch.

01:46.806 --> 01:49.540
I'm not gonna miss any
of the family events.

01:49.541 --> 01:52.944
I am really looking forward
to carol and tom's wedding.

01:52.945 --> 01:55.847
Lisa and jeff.

01:57.716 --> 02:00.418
I'm looking forward
to their wedding, too.

03:08.087 --> 03:11.122
Tim, do you have to drive
so fast?

03:11.123 --> 03:15.726
I just want to make sure
I don't miss one minute
of that arrival dinner.

03:15.727 --> 03:20.064
Yeah, right. What activity
are you trying to squeeze in
before the dinner?

03:20.065 --> 03:23.201
Water-skiing?
Absolutely not.

03:23.202 --> 03:25.436
<i>(mark)</i> we're going
fly-fishing.

03:25.437 --> 03:27.338
Mark!
Tim.

03:27.339 --> 03:29.740
<i>(randy)</i> floor it, dad.

03:33.779 --> 03:36.281
Oh, isn't this cute?
It's real cute. Yeah.

03:36.282 --> 03:38.783
Look,
they gave us fruit.
Cute fruit. That's great.

03:38.784 --> 03:41.286
Boys, your room is
through here. Hurry up.

03:41.287 --> 03:45.690
That last pit stop
of your mom's cost us,
like, 12 minutes.

03:45.691 --> 03:48.092
Excuse me. I just
didn't feel comfortable

03:48.093 --> 03:50.928
Using a coffee can
at 55 miles per hour.

03:52.798 --> 03:56.334
That's too bad.
That's one of the perks
of driving by car.

03:56.335 --> 03:58.302
I'll try to remember that
next time.

03:58.303 --> 04:00.805
You sure you don't want
to go fly-fishing with us?

04:00.806 --> 04:03.574
I gotta wash up
and work on that poem
I'm writing for the wedding.

04:03.575 --> 04:05.577
All right.

04:05.578 --> 04:08.847
Tim?
Huh?

04:08.848 --> 04:11.849
Hi! It's great
to see you again.

04:11.850 --> 04:14.018
It is.

04:14.019 --> 04:16.254
You don't know who I am,
do you?

04:16.255 --> 04:18.690
No, I don't.

04:18.690 --> 04:21.526
I'm bonnie,
jill's second cousin.

04:21.527 --> 04:23.495
Uncle tubby's daughter?

04:23.496 --> 04:25.329
Oh, yeah.

04:25.330 --> 04:28.366
Gosh, how is uncle tubby
doing?

04:28.367 --> 04:31.169
He's been dead
for ten years.

04:31.170 --> 04:34.906
So he's doing the same,
then, isn't he?

04:34.907 --> 04:37.241
Right.
Anyway, some good news.

04:37.242 --> 04:41.112
I just put together
an early arrival
cocktail party.

04:41.113 --> 04:43.515
Doesn't that sound
like just too much fun?

04:43.516 --> 04:46.751
Oh, way too much.

04:46.752 --> 04:48.986
I don't think
we can make it...
Hi, bonnie.

04:48.987 --> 04:51.289
Jill!
We'll be there.

04:51.290 --> 04:53.792
Great. It's at 5:00.
I'll see you there.

04:53.793 --> 04:56.494
5:00?

04:56.495 --> 04:57.895
Boys, hurry up.

04:57.896 --> 05:00.398
We only have
an hour and a half
to go fly-fishing,

05:00.399 --> 05:02.633
Thanks to cousin chubby.

05:14.779 --> 05:18.550
Ah, wilson,
this is the life, huh?

05:18.551 --> 05:19.951
Mm-hmm.

05:19.952 --> 05:22.286
Guys communing
with nature.

05:22.287 --> 05:23.822
Mm-hmm.

05:23.823 --> 05:26.958
Getting away
from the city...

05:26.959 --> 05:30.027
And the clutches
of a suffocating,
domineering mother

05:30.028 --> 05:33.197
Who won't allow her son
to grow up.

05:33.198 --> 05:34.966
Let it go, al.

05:34.967 --> 05:36.668
Forget mother.

05:36.669 --> 05:39.938
Immerse yourself
in the tranquility of the river.

05:39.939 --> 05:44.309
You're right, wilson.
It's so peaceful out here.

05:44.310 --> 05:46.678
Why spoil it?

05:46.679 --> 05:50.047
All right, all right!
Hey!

05:50.048 --> 05:51.749
We're finally here!

05:53.119 --> 05:55.453
All right, boys.
Fish fast.

05:55.454 --> 05:58.189
We got 53 minutes,
all right?

05:58.190 --> 05:59.624
<i>(whistles)</i>

05:59.625 --> 06:02.694
Look, it's al al bean.

06:08.434 --> 06:10.468
What's the deal
with these fish?

06:10.469 --> 06:12.103
We haven't had
a single bite.

06:12.104 --> 06:14.873
Dad, we've only been here
seven minutes.

06:14.874 --> 06:17.976
Hey, wilson, can you show us
how to do that forward cast?

06:17.977 --> 06:19.010
Certainly, lad.

06:19.011 --> 06:21.813
You hold your rod
at one o'clock,

06:21.814 --> 06:24.481
And you end up
at ten o'clock.

06:28.788 --> 06:31.656
Dad, he said ten o'clock.

06:31.657 --> 06:35.860
I didn't know he meant
ten o'clock eastern time.

06:35.861 --> 06:40.598
Well, I see you're as adept
at fly-fishing as you were
at ice fishing.

06:40.599 --> 06:43.435
I'll bet you 20 bucks
I can catch more fish
than you.

06:43.436 --> 06:44.969
You're on.

06:44.970 --> 06:47.538
Tim, al, we're not here
to compete.

06:47.539 --> 06:50.542
We're here to achieve
a higher consciousness.

06:50.543 --> 06:51.876
He's right, tim.

06:51.877 --> 06:57.481
By creating a competition,
we insult the spirit
of the river.

06:57.482 --> 06:59.617
I'm so sorry, river.

06:59.618 --> 07:04.289
But you can help me out
by burping up a couple
of them fish, ok?

07:04.290 --> 07:07.492
I have to warn you
that even accomplished fishermen
can spend hours out here

07:07.493 --> 07:09.461
And not catch anything.

07:09.462 --> 07:12.163
Hey, guys, I got one!

07:46.098 --> 07:49.300
Hi. Hey. It's good
to see you all.

07:49.301 --> 07:51.302
We did a little
fly-fishing today.

07:51.303 --> 07:54.339
And, boy, did we catch
a lot of flies!

07:54.340 --> 07:59.010
Here we are,
just like I promised,
with 30 seconds to spare.

07:59.011 --> 08:01.880
You should've taken
that 30 seconds to shower.

08:01.881 --> 08:06.017
<i>(clears throat)</i>

08:06.018 --> 08:08.920
Excuse me. Aunt edna,
good to see you.

08:08.921 --> 08:10.654
All right.

08:13.658 --> 08:15.326
Don't hit me.

08:15.327 --> 08:16.994
Stop hitting me.

08:16.995 --> 08:19.497
Tell her
to stop hitting me.
You're gonna hurt her.

08:28.807 --> 08:31.609
<i>(alarm beeps)</i>

08:33.679 --> 08:37.148
Tim, why are you
getting up so early?
Come back to bed.

08:37.149 --> 08:40.217
I got a lot of fun stuff
to squeeze in today,

08:40.217 --> 08:44.321
And I can't waste time
in bed with you.

08:47.426 --> 08:50.060
<i>(♪ "william tell overture")</i>

11:24.916 --> 11:27.652
"to my cousin lisa
on her wedding day..."

11:27.653 --> 11:30.153
Hey, jill, I -
no, wait. Shh.

11:30.154 --> 11:33.925
"as the gentle wind
kisses the morning dew..."

11:33.926 --> 11:37.094
"everything you say
bounces off me
and sticks to you."

11:39.832 --> 11:41.632
I'm just trying to help.

11:41.633 --> 11:44.368
<i>(clears throat)</i>

11:44.369 --> 11:47.771
"to my cousin lisa
on her wedding day..."

11:47.772 --> 11:50.941
Don't do it! Don't do it!
Don't do it! Don't do it.

11:52.577 --> 11:54.578
What are the boys doing?

11:54.579 --> 11:57.347
Getting their suits on.
We're going water-skiing.

11:57.348 --> 11:59.016
You're going skiing now?

11:59.017 --> 12:01.018
Yeah. The wedding's
not for four hours.

12:01.019 --> 12:03.287
Finish your poetry.
We'll be back in time.

12:03.288 --> 12:05.289
Oh, I am so sick
of working on this poem.

12:05.290 --> 12:09.593
I spent the last two hours
trying to come up with
a rhyme for "matrimony."

12:11.229 --> 12:13.965
It's easy - "schmatrimony."

12:13.966 --> 12:17.668
Thanks. Why didn't I
think of that?

12:17.669 --> 12:19.904
If you're bored with this,
come with us for a bit.

12:19.905 --> 12:23.374
I'll let you drive the boat,
you'll get a little color.

12:23.375 --> 12:26.410
It sure would be fun
to go out with you guys
for a while.

12:26.411 --> 12:28.479
Ok, I'll do it.
All right.

12:28.480 --> 12:30.280
I borrowed
my buddy tony's boat.

12:30.281 --> 12:32.884
It's got that
inboard big block v-8.

12:32.885 --> 12:36.587
Tony's boat. That's the one
with the roller rockers
and the supercharged 454?

12:36.588 --> 12:38.356
How did you know that?

12:38.357 --> 12:42.025
You cry it out in your sleep
at least once a week.

12:43.495 --> 12:45.762
Way to go, brad!

12:51.703 --> 12:54.771
Whoo! Great!
Of course he's great!
He's my kid.

12:54.772 --> 12:56.207
Good goin'!

12:56.208 --> 12:59.677
Hey, we're your kids, too.
How come we fall on our butts?

12:59.678 --> 13:01.712
Hey, I gave you
the water-skiing gene.

13:01.713 --> 13:04.648
What you do with it
is your business.
Attaboy!

13:22.000 --> 13:25.069
Way to go, dad!
Yeah!

13:25.070 --> 13:26.204
Watch this!

13:30.108 --> 13:32.275
<i>(indistinct)</i>

13:32.276 --> 13:33.511
Whoa!

13:33.512 --> 13:35.279
One more time around, ok?

13:40.084 --> 13:41.985
Whoo!

13:47.960 --> 13:50.094
Way to go, dad!
Yeah!

14:01.005 --> 14:05.742
Next time I'll show you guys
what I can really do. Whoo!

14:05.743 --> 14:09.213
<i>(brad)</i> mom,
you're the only one
that didn't ski.

14:09.214 --> 14:11.582
Mom can't water-ski.
What do you mean?

14:11.583 --> 14:14.418
I used to be
a great skier.
Tell 'em, tim.

14:14.419 --> 14:15.953
Yeah, used to be.

14:15.954 --> 14:17.955
It's a little different
than it is now.

14:17.956 --> 14:20.024
Oh, really?
What's that supposed to mean?

14:20.025 --> 14:22.960
Don't be ashamed of it.
You used to be a good athlete.

14:22.961 --> 14:25.429
Now you write poetry
and go to weddings.

14:25.430 --> 14:27.999
All right,
let's head back.
Hey.

14:28.000 --> 14:31.402
We head back
when I say we head back.

14:31.403 --> 14:32.603
Hit it!

14:37.476 --> 14:39.042
Whoo!

14:45.217 --> 14:47.517
Yay, mom! Yeah!

14:50.689 --> 14:52.455
Hey, look up there!

14:55.193 --> 14:58.796
Cool.
If we hurry, we can get
some parasailing in.

15:00.999 --> 15:03.200
Hey, dad,
look out for the ramp!

15:09.508 --> 15:10.874
Tim!

15:20.318 --> 15:23.754
Jill, you don't want to be late
for the wedding.

15:23.755 --> 15:26.256
Are you sure
mom's well enough
to go?

15:26.257 --> 15:27.591
She's fine, ok?

15:32.830 --> 15:35.099
I can't believe this.

15:35.100 --> 15:38.469
I have a bandage on my nose,
a sprained wrist,
my knee is sore

15:38.470 --> 15:42.006
And my butt is
completely black and blue.

15:42.007 --> 15:44.775
You got some color.

15:44.776 --> 15:48.546
Do you think that's funny?!

15:48.547 --> 15:51.816
Not if you don't.

15:51.817 --> 15:56.020
There is no way
that I can show my face
at this wedding.

15:56.021 --> 15:59.190
Ah, darn.
And we so wanted to go.

15:59.191 --> 16:01.359
Do you think that's funny?

16:01.360 --> 16:03.893
Not if you don't.

16:05.097 --> 16:07.631
I could never go to that party
and enjoy myself

16:07.632 --> 16:10.234
Knowing that my mother
was back here suffering.

16:11.870 --> 16:13.837
I know,
it's not funny.
I know.

16:13.838 --> 16:16.507
Comb your hair
and get your ties ready.

16:16.508 --> 16:19.009
Honey, you've gotta go
to this wedding.

16:19.010 --> 16:21.245
Why do I have to go?

16:26.218 --> 16:28.986
I have a -
I have a million reasons.

16:31.756 --> 16:33.991
It's your favorite cousin.

16:33.992 --> 16:37.428
And you'd hate yourself forever
if you didn't go.

16:37.429 --> 16:40.131
Actually, I'd hate you.

16:40.132 --> 16:43.034
I thought of that, too.

16:43.035 --> 16:44.902
I'm really sorry
I wasn't looking

16:44.903 --> 16:46.904
Where I was going
in the boat, ok?

16:46.905 --> 16:50.474
I cannot believe
that I let you talk me
into water-skiing.

16:50.475 --> 16:54.211
You wanted to go.
If you'd let go of the rope,
you wouldn't be hurt now.

16:54.212 --> 16:56.814
You actually think
this is my fault?
Not if you don't.

16:58.216 --> 17:01.651
Honey, you can't let some nicks
and cuts and contusions

17:01.652 --> 17:04.088
Stop you from going.

17:04.089 --> 17:06.990
Heck, if I did that,
I wouldn't go anywhere.

17:09.127 --> 17:11.528
There is no way
that I can get up

17:11.529 --> 17:14.030
In front
of all of these people.

17:14.031 --> 17:16.031
You look great.

17:16.032 --> 17:20.436
And once you put your makeup on,
no one's even gonna notice.

17:20.438 --> 17:22.638
My makeup is on.

17:24.675 --> 17:26.810
Looks quite natural.

17:29.847 --> 17:32.249
<i>(♪ soft guitar)</i>

17:36.487 --> 17:39.289
Everybody's staring at me.

17:39.290 --> 17:40.724
No, they're not.

17:40.725 --> 17:42.726
Then who are they
staring at?

17:42.727 --> 17:45.629
Who do you think?
The star of <i>tool time.</i>

17:48.133 --> 17:50.667
And now lisa's cousin
jill taylor

17:50.668 --> 17:52.169
Has prepared a poem

17:52.170 --> 17:55.539
On the grace and sanctity
of marriage.

17:55.540 --> 17:58.509
Go get 'em, honey.
I'm not going up there.

17:58.510 --> 18:00.511
They're waiting for you.
Come on.
Ow!

18:00.512 --> 18:02.646
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

18:05.317 --> 18:07.985
I don't want to do this.
Go, go, go.

18:17.362 --> 18:20.030
Are you all right?
I'm fine. I'm fine.

18:25.870 --> 18:27.371
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

18:29.141 --> 18:34.844
Um... Uh...
To my cousin lisa
on her wedding day.

18:34.845 --> 18:38.516
"as a gentle wind
kisses the morning dew..."

18:38.517 --> 18:41.752
A little louder.
We can't hear you!

18:44.256 --> 18:46.990
"as a gentle wind kisses..."

18:46.991 --> 18:48.993
Let me get - I'll take -

18:48.994 --> 18:51.061
I'll just move -
excuse me. Excuse me.

18:53.298 --> 18:54.498
Ow!

19:06.077 --> 19:09.279
It's gonna be
a long ride home.

19:12.283 --> 19:14.685
Honey, you know it's true
what they say.

19:14.686 --> 19:17.020
No matter how great
the vacation,

19:17.021 --> 19:19.089
It's always good
to be home, huh?

19:19.090 --> 19:21.891
Don't touch me.
Don't... Touch me.

19:21.892 --> 19:25.129
Always good to be home.

19:25.130 --> 19:28.632
Well, guys,
I think there's something
we can all learn from this.

19:28.633 --> 19:33.137
Yeah, that a nose
can be broken more
than once in a day.

19:33.138 --> 19:35.973
I don't think that's it.

19:35.974 --> 19:39.410
Dad, mom is never
gonna forgive you
for this one.

19:39.411 --> 19:42.112
I'm just glad we got
one great weekend in

19:42.113 --> 19:45.282
Before everything came
to a crashing end.

19:45.283 --> 19:49.987
Yeah. I had a lot of fun.
Sorry you're so dead, dad.

19:49.988 --> 19:51.355
I am not dead.

19:51.356 --> 19:54.758
I've got a million ideas
up here how to make this up
to your mom.

19:54.759 --> 19:58.696
Are any of them good?

19:58.697 --> 20:00.697
Not a one.

20:03.367 --> 20:07.237
That's 454 at the...

20:07.238 --> 20:11.307
Supercharged roller rockers.
Tony... Hit it, tony!

20:12.910 --> 20:15.145
That's 454...

20:15.146 --> 20:16.747
Tim.
454...

20:16.748 --> 20:18.148
Tim.

20:18.149 --> 20:20.917
Tony! Ton- honey, hi.

20:20.918 --> 20:23.020
Boy, I was having
a good dream.

20:23.021 --> 20:26.657
What are you doing down here?
You never came to bed.

20:26.658 --> 20:29.793
I was afraid if I rolled over,
I'd finish you off.

20:35.734 --> 20:39.270
I really feel bad you got
all banged up this weekend.
Yeah, me too.

20:39.271 --> 20:41.738
It would've been nice
to show up at the wedding

20:41.739 --> 20:44.241
Without any
hairline fractures.

20:44.242 --> 20:46.410
You wouldn't have
got hurt at all

20:46.411 --> 20:49.413
If I weren't so obsessed
with having fun.

20:49.414 --> 20:53.017
Well, I gotta admit
that's another thing
that really made me mad.

20:53.018 --> 20:55.552
You guys
got to have all the fun.

20:55.553 --> 20:58.555
Well, look, I promise you,
next family wedding we go to,

20:58.556 --> 21:02.126
We'll all have no fun
together.

21:02.127 --> 21:03.894
What is all this stuff?

21:03.895 --> 21:07.264
Oh. Well, I wrote you
a little poem.

21:15.140 --> 21:19.343
Maybe... Maybe you'd like
to listen to it before you
start laughing at me.

21:19.344 --> 21:21.078
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

21:21.079 --> 21:22.613
<i>(clears throat)</i>

21:22.614 --> 21:26.416
"I was going to buy you jewelry
and maybe some flowers.

21:26.417 --> 21:30.086
"instead, I stayed up
till the wee morning hours,

21:30.087 --> 21:32.355
"thinking about
how lucky I am.

21:32.356 --> 21:35.792
"boy, I'm hungry.
I feel like ham.

21:37.495 --> 21:39.396
"my selfishness
I will try to conquer.

21:39.397 --> 21:43.100
"I'm sorry I bopped you
on your honker.

21:43.101 --> 21:45.636
"I'll love you forever,
even when you're old.

21:45.637 --> 21:51.107
If you don't like this poem,
I've got the florist on hold."

21:55.312 --> 21:58.882
All right, dad. Now, remember,
one o'clock, ten o'clock.

21:58.883 --> 22:00.417
One o'clock, ten o'clock.

22:00.418 --> 22:03.520
Let me have this thing.
You count, ok?

22:03.521 --> 22:05.922
<i>(whistles)</i>

22:05.923 --> 22:07.924
What are you guys
doing?

22:07.925 --> 22:10.728
Just getting a little
fly-fishing practice in
before church.

22:10.729 --> 22:12.996
Well, honey, hurry up.
We're gonna be late.

22:12.997 --> 22:14.898
All right.
Just one more.

22:16.801 --> 22:19.836
Tim!
