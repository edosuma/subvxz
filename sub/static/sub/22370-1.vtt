00:01.960 --> 00:03.678
Last season on "Freakish"...

00:03.703 --> 00:05.445
The chemical plant's on fire!

00:08.566 --> 00:10.522
We have to stay inside,
keep the windows closed

00:10.547 --> 00:12.132
and we cannot breathe that air.

00:12.157 --> 00:13.784
No, no, no, no.
You can't go out in that.

00:13.785 --> 00:15.997
- Move out of the way.
- People, no.

00:17.458 --> 00:18.711
These are all useless.

00:18.712 --> 00:20.005
All of them except this one.

00:20.006 --> 00:22.760
So only one of us can leave.

00:22.761 --> 00:24.764
The primary goal is to
get to the fire station.

00:24.765 --> 00:26.685
- If it's still there.
- Good luck, man.

00:26.686 --> 00:28.899
Let's do it.

00:30.569 --> 00:32.738
John Collins, Rescue and Recovery.

00:32.740 --> 00:34.325
20 more minutes in this place.

00:34.326 --> 00:36.546
- We have a vaccine.
- Just a pinch.

00:36.547 --> 00:37.587
Okay.

00:39.336 --> 00:41.470
Proof he's not with the government.

00:41.674 --> 00:43.218
Collins works for Keller?

00:43.219 --> 00:44.849
It's not a vaccine.

00:44.874 --> 00:46.809
It's a poison. He's here to kill us.

00:46.810 --> 00:49.773
- They're breaking through!
- Hey!

00:55.478 --> 00:58.566
Oh, LeShawn. Oh, my God, is that you?

00:58.676 --> 00:59.969
They followed me here.

_

01:56.073 --> 01:58.661
Ah!

03:02.831 --> 03:05.423
I need help.

03:27.923 --> 03:30.428
- Take it easy, you're safe.
- Where am I at?

03:30.652 --> 03:32.487
- What are you putting in me?
- It's a saline drip.

03:32.512 --> 03:34.936
You were severely dehydrated.
We also gave you insulin.

03:34.937 --> 03:36.982
Your sugars were dangerously high.

03:36.983 --> 03:39.612
- How long have I been out?
- 12 hours.

03:39.815 --> 03:42.194
I can't be out for 12 hours.
My friends need help.

03:42.219 --> 03:43.992
You came in alone.

03:46.168 --> 03:48.087
My friends in the high school.

03:48.088 --> 03:50.468
We ran out of water yesterday.

03:50.750 --> 03:53.921
Shit. Yo, how'd you let
me sleep for 12 hours?

03:54.017 --> 03:55.728
I can have people go get them.

03:55.729 --> 03:57.690
- How many were there?
- Six.

03:57.804 --> 04:00.726
- Is the school secure?
- Yeah, we blocked the doors.

04:00.727 --> 04:02.479
But other than water, they're safe?

04:02.480 --> 04:04.817
They have weapons?
They can protect themselves?

04:04.818 --> 04:06.529
Just the ones we made.

04:06.530 --> 04:09.076
So no guns.

04:11.428 --> 04:13.960
No details about what
happened in that lab.

04:13.961 --> 04:16.339
Not one likely cooperated?

04:16.341 --> 04:18.553
And you have no idea where he is?

04:18.553 --> 04:19.887
Or the girl?

04:25.317 --> 04:28.657
I have some matters
that need my attention.

04:28.658 --> 04:29.806
Drink slowly.

04:30.001 --> 04:31.829
I'll be back soon to debrief you.

04:31.830 --> 04:34.246
You sending people to
the high school right away?

04:36.606 --> 04:38.712
Of course.

05:46.996 --> 05:49.417
We're ready to extract.

05:49.653 --> 05:52.427
Project Wednesday, Participant 302.

05:53.201 --> 05:55.997
Retrieved five days post release.

06:14.536 --> 06:16.539
You'll never find it.

06:16.540 --> 06:18.762
It'll find you.

06:41.574 --> 06:43.452
I'm checking upstairs.

06:54.239 --> 06:56.159
I need keys!

06:56.160 --> 06:57.370
I got him.

07:28.843 --> 07:30.663
_

07:31.593 --> 07:33.137
Run.

07:33.294 --> 07:34.669
Now.

07:54.359 --> 07:55.625
What happened here?

07:55.650 --> 07:57.949
They got let out of the shelter.
Keller tried to kill us.

07:57.950 --> 07:59.746
They still might.

08:03.301 --> 08:05.255
- They're gone.
- Gone?

08:05.256 --> 08:07.511
- Where'd they go?
- So they're not coming inside.

08:07.512 --> 08:09.556
Best guess they're
assessing the situation?

08:09.557 --> 08:11.104
They wanna see what they're dealing with

08:11.129 --> 08:12.831
before they enter. LeShawn,
what did you tell them?

08:12.856 --> 08:14.848
- I told them my friends were here.
- Did you give details?

08:14.873 --> 08:16.209
I just told them we needed help.

08:16.210 --> 08:17.479
- That's it.
- You're sure?

08:17.557 --> 08:18.857
Look, if it's something you wanna

08:18.882 --> 08:20.319
say to me, you should just say it.

08:20.344 --> 08:23.142
- I need specifics.
- You brought these people here.

08:23.143 --> 08:24.979
I beat them here so I
could warn you about them!

08:24.980 --> 08:26.731
Because you revealed our location.

08:26.756 --> 08:27.928
Okay, stop it!

08:27.953 --> 08:29.131
Both of you.

08:29.824 --> 08:31.451
The others don't know what's going on.

08:31.452 --> 08:33.341
So go.

08:39.677 --> 08:41.721
A lot can change in a day, huh?

08:41.722 --> 08:43.642
I mean, yeah. You're still alive.

08:43.643 --> 08:44.930
I saw how you was looking at

08:44.955 --> 08:46.785
that pencil dick when I got here.

08:46.941 --> 08:48.735
- Barrett?
- Yeah, Barrett.

08:48.736 --> 08:50.196
And you were hugged up on the couch.

08:50.197 --> 08:51.783
I wasn't even gone for two days.

08:51.784 --> 08:53.186
On the couch.

08:53.705 --> 08:55.248
You mean when he was comforting me

08:55.249 --> 08:57.503
after my best friend died?

08:57.714 --> 08:58.810
Natalie died?

08:59.622 --> 09:01.636
That's what you're jealous of?

09:01.637 --> 09:03.446
That he was just sitting with me

09:03.471 --> 09:06.180
after I watched her get eaten?

09:07.106 --> 09:08.474
I didn't know.

09:08.959 --> 09:10.578
Look, I'm sorry. Come here.

09:11.699 --> 09:12.922
I'm sorry.

09:13.495 --> 09:15.714
I couldn't do what Natalie did.

09:16.381 --> 09:18.843
I mean, I'd wanna help everybody,

09:18.922 --> 09:20.926
but to go like that...

09:23.305 --> 09:25.582
I don't know how Diesel can deal.

09:27.188 --> 09:29.192
It's gonna take time.

09:31.572 --> 09:33.366
He'll figure it out.

09:33.367 --> 09:35.232
It's awful, isn't it?

09:36.269 --> 09:37.704
Being so close to someone.

09:37.729 --> 09:39.552
To have it taken away.

09:42.343 --> 09:44.634
Makes me think it's not even worth it.

09:45.432 --> 09:47.682
Of course it's worth it.

09:48.606 --> 09:51.277
I mean, Diesel hurts now, but...

09:51.278 --> 09:53.657
I mean, at least he had someone.

09:53.658 --> 09:54.826
Maybe.

09:57.465 --> 09:58.774
Hey, if I lost you,

09:58.799 --> 10:01.435
I would be crushed, but...

10:01.882 --> 10:04.261
I would still be glad that we had this.

10:11.276 --> 10:13.614
You wouldn't be glad that we had this?

10:13.615 --> 10:15.451
Of course I would.

10:15.452 --> 10:16.640
But?

10:18.791 --> 10:20.211
It's nothing.

10:21.087 --> 10:22.362
It's just hard.

10:25.930 --> 10:28.084
Yeah, we're all vulnerable.

10:29.228 --> 10:30.365
Yeah.

10:31.066 --> 10:32.582
Hey...

10:33.696 --> 10:35.815
You know I'm not going anywhere, right?

10:38.163 --> 10:40.250
I'm not gonna hurt you.

10:47.465 --> 10:49.093
Shit. Is that another one?

10:49.509 --> 10:50.720
Go, go.

10:50.745 --> 10:52.660
This way, this way.

10:54.571 --> 10:56.742
Okay, come on.

11:12.386 --> 11:14.139
You need to come out here.

11:14.802 --> 11:16.481
Come on. Let's go.

11:27.261 --> 11:29.640
- Dude, what the hell happened?
- What's up, man?

11:29.641 --> 11:31.603
- Talk later.
- We can't stay here.

11:31.604 --> 11:32.914
- They're coming in.
- Come on, come on.

11:32.939 --> 11:34.942
Go, go, go! Let's go!

12:26.015 --> 12:28.976
Don't shoot. You got me.

12:29.424 --> 12:31.024
Walk.

12:49.380 --> 12:51.524
This would go a lot
easier if you cooperate.

12:54.162 --> 12:55.873
Where are your friends?

12:55.898 --> 12:57.304
I don't know.

12:58.873 --> 13:01.546
So they just disappeared?

13:02.352 --> 13:04.355
After you went all the
way out in this muck

13:04.380 --> 13:06.844
to find help for them.

13:08.476 --> 13:10.437
Nice friends.

13:12.859 --> 13:14.779
Hello out there.

13:14.953 --> 13:17.415
- I have your friend here.
- What the hell is she doing?

13:17.440 --> 13:20.530
And he wants to talk to me.

13:27.001 --> 13:30.007
Are you right handed or left?

13:31.513 --> 13:34.183
Doesn't matter, I guess.

13:34.348 --> 13:36.696
I'm gonna ask you again.

13:38.524 --> 13:41.529
Where are your friends?

13:41.530 --> 13:43.950
I told you. Looks like
some of them turned freak,

13:43.951 --> 13:45.850
the other ones must have left.

13:48.851 --> 13:50.688
- Ahh!
- Ah!

13:50.924 --> 13:52.551
Wrong answer.

13:52.552 --> 13:55.223
- Where are they?
- I told you!

13:57.061 --> 13:58.522
We have to do something to help him.

13:58.523 --> 14:01.360
- Shh. We can't.
- We should rush her.

14:01.361 --> 14:03.155
Hey, maybe you're right.

14:03.402 --> 14:04.780
I mean, she can't shoot all of us.

14:04.805 --> 14:06.119
I have a better idea.

14:06.120 --> 14:08.792
We might be able to call her
away if I can get to my radio.

14:29.710 --> 14:31.137
Stay here.

15:12.294 --> 15:14.240
Nice try.

15:15.718 --> 15:18.430
- We should talk about this.
- On your knees.

15:18.431 --> 15:20.735
Keep your hands where I can see them.

15:23.050 --> 15:25.136
_

15:34.296 --> 15:36.619
That changes things.

15:36.644 --> 15:38.813
Diesel, stop!

15:44.651 --> 15:46.567
I couldn't get their band on my radio.

15:49.368 --> 15:50.856
Doesn't matter.

15:51.519 --> 15:53.732
We got something better.

15:58.896 --> 16:00.565
I was with y'all for
the last couple days.

16:00.590 --> 16:02.092
I don't know where they went.

16:02.117 --> 16:04.580
Need backup, science wing.

16:07.614 --> 16:10.243
Hey, come on, help me with this.

16:25.483 --> 16:27.276
Oh, that's my friend, Diesel.

16:27.277 --> 16:29.322
He must've turned when I was gone.

16:29.323 --> 16:30.706
Keep moving.

16:30.784 --> 16:32.343
There's a freak.

16:38.717 --> 16:40.302
Have you cleared the main building?

16:40.303 --> 16:42.444
- Yeah.
- Then I'm gonna see what's going on

16:42.469 --> 16:44.310
with O'Grady in the science wing.

16:44.311 --> 16:45.987
Copy.

16:46.012 --> 16:47.675
Move it.

16:48.779 --> 16:50.364
They're coming.

16:54.415 --> 16:56.961
- There's four of us.
- One of her.

16:56.962 --> 16:59.091
We need to wait.

17:07.650 --> 17:08.693
Uh!

17:13.787 --> 17:15.498
We need her gone without seeing us.

17:15.499 --> 17:18.560
- Let's hurt her.
- No. Wait.

17:20.593 --> 17:23.681
Shoot me. The noise'll draw the freaks.

17:23.682 --> 17:27.271
Maybe. But I know I can
get out faster than you.

17:27.271 --> 17:28.979
I don't know, I'm pretty fast.

17:29.004 --> 17:30.737
I bet you were.

17:57.291 --> 17:59.188
Ah!

18:01.424 --> 18:03.428
Thanks, bro.

18:06.518 --> 18:08.353
You sure you took care of our survivor?

18:08.354 --> 18:10.526
Mutants did.

18:13.031 --> 18:14.867
Poe to base.

18:14.868 --> 18:17.790
The high school's cleared.
We're heading back.

18:23.124 --> 18:24.891
Oh, my God.

18:24.916 --> 18:26.084
- They're hurting him.
- No.

18:26.085 --> 18:27.510
They're splinting his leg.

18:27.870 --> 18:29.748
Oh, it's broken badly.

18:29.903 --> 18:31.574
He's gonna be okay.

18:37.001 --> 18:39.296
Have you ever broken a bone before?

18:39.297 --> 18:42.678
Yeah. My wrist two years ago at state.

18:42.679 --> 18:44.102
Well, so you know.

18:44.127 --> 18:47.018
You know it hurts like
hell until they stabilize it.

19:08.021 --> 19:10.236
What were you showing that space dude?

19:10.943 --> 19:12.197
What do you mean?

19:12.603 --> 19:14.157
I mean that he was about to shoot you

19:14.158 --> 19:16.502
and then you showed him
something that made him stop.

19:17.182 --> 19:19.436
From what I remember, you stopped him.

19:19.547 --> 19:22.493
Look, man, don't bullshit me,
all right? I know what I saw.

19:22.795 --> 19:24.313
I'm not bullshitting you.

19:24.385 --> 19:26.181
I think you're confused.

19:26.182 --> 19:28.102
You're hiding something.

19:28.103 --> 19:29.816
And there was a time I thought

19:29.841 --> 19:31.358
scraping gum into buckets

19:31.359 --> 19:33.388
was the grossest job possible.

19:34.365 --> 19:36.727
Sorry, am I interrupting something?

19:37.285 --> 19:38.362
No.

19:38.605 --> 19:40.836
No, Grover and I, we were just, uh,

19:40.837 --> 19:42.673
just talking about the Keller dude.

19:42.674 --> 19:44.201
Which one?

19:44.779 --> 19:46.889
The one Diesel saved me from.

19:46.890 --> 19:48.193
Yeah?

19:49.896 --> 19:52.776
- Diesel thinks that he saw something.
- Oh, I know I saw something.

19:52.777 --> 19:55.741
- I just don't know what it was.
- Dude, I had my hands up.

19:55.742 --> 19:57.813
I was practically begging
the guy not to kill me.

19:57.838 --> 19:59.048
Then you saved me.

19:59.073 --> 20:00.500
That's what I remember.

20:00.501 --> 20:02.793
Sounds like he owes you his life.

20:04.300 --> 20:06.223
So I guess I owe you, too.

20:24.758 --> 20:26.301
Come here.

20:26.302 --> 20:27.950
I don't wanna hurt you.

20:28.055 --> 20:29.364
Come here.

20:30.770 --> 20:33.349
How bad is it?

20:34.057 --> 20:36.227
It's gonna hurt.

20:36.573 --> 20:39.285
But it doesn't hurt as
bad as yesterday, so...

20:39.676 --> 20:41.257
I'll be okay.

20:41.995 --> 20:43.164
Promise?

20:44.213 --> 20:46.510
I told you I was coming back, didn't I?

20:49.827 --> 20:51.601
I really thought I lost you.

20:53.440 --> 20:55.057
And then Natalie.

20:55.261 --> 20:57.067
I'm here now.

21:03.669 --> 21:05.923
I'm lucky you got out
of that place alive.

21:08.470 --> 21:09.650
Yeah.

21:14.441 --> 21:16.422
We're screwed, aren't we?

21:18.520 --> 21:20.437
You want me to say it?

21:21.329 --> 21:22.458
Yeah.

21:22.848 --> 21:24.720
Oh, yeah, we're screwed.

21:24.878 --> 21:27.424
Think about it. We have one good mask.

21:27.425 --> 21:30.430
We have plenty of water
until they shut it off again.

21:30.431 --> 21:33.185
Food will absolutely
run out, eventually.

21:33.186 --> 21:35.189
And who knows how long
these air filters will last

21:35.190 --> 21:38.070
before we all end up
turning into freaks.

21:38.071 --> 21:39.597
And even if we do make it out of

21:39.622 --> 21:41.076
here and get past the freaks,

21:41.077 --> 21:43.038
humans are killing people.

21:43.343 --> 21:44.841
Well, great.

21:44.866 --> 21:47.536
Thanks. I didn't even
think about the air filters.

21:48.216 --> 21:50.155
I don't know what happens next.

21:50.972 --> 21:53.975
But I do know that I'm
glad to be here with you.

21:55.006 --> 21:56.119
I am, too.

21:56.144 --> 21:57.567
Really?

21:57.568 --> 21:58.987
You won't regret having been with me

21:58.988 --> 22:00.782
just in case you ever lose me?

22:01.004 --> 22:03.764
Which isn't gonna happen.

22:04.039 --> 22:06.836
I won't ever regret being here with you.
