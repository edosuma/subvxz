00:00.900 --> 00:02.800
spirts all around us.

00:03.000 --> 00:07.100
They can fuse their psychic energy
into objects in our everyday lives.

00:07.800 --> 00:09.900
You take something like this.

00:10.300 --> 00:12.100
This is a powerful totem.

00:12.800 --> 00:18.200
Through it, i can feel the future,
sometimes the past, but always the truth.

00:18.600 --> 00:21.800
Now,whose earring am i holding?

00:22.100 --> 00:24.100
Uh,that's mine.

00:25.500 --> 00:26.800
And you are?

00:27.100 --> 00:29.900
- Delia.
- Delia.

00:32.100 --> 00:34.500
- You're a skeptic.
- Guilty.

00:34.600 --> 00:39.400
Ahh, i love skeptics.
You're always the most fun to convince.

00:39.700 --> 00:41.100
Delia.

00:41.700 --> 00:44.900
Let's see what the spirits
can tell me through this earring.

00:46.400 --> 00:49.200
- It is a gift.
- That's right.

00:49.300 --> 00:52.900
You treasure it,
but your husband didn't give it to you.

00:53.200 --> 00:54.600
Right again.

00:55.100 --> 00:56.700
I'm getting an "N" Name.

00:57.700 --> 01:00.000
N-n-na.

01:00.400 --> 01:02.600
Ned. Is that right?

01:03.200 --> 01:04.900
Your son gave it to you?

01:06.300 --> 01:10.500
That's absolutely right.
I'm... Very impressed.

01:10.700 --> 01:13.700
A round of applause for skeptic delia.

01:17.300 --> 01:20.300
I don't know what's funnier,
that you're here or that i'm here.

01:20.400 --> 01:23.900
- Can i get another volunteer?
- Uh,yeah, right here.Right here.

01:24.500 --> 01:25.700
I hate you.

01:25.800 --> 01:28.700
You come to this bookstore as much as i do.
Now give him love.

01:31.300 --> 01:33.500
Wonderful.
And who do i have the pleasure of meeting?

01:33.600 --> 01:35.600
- Melinda.
- Melinda.

01:35.700 --> 01:38.000
And you're happily married,aren't you?

01:38.100 --> 01:41.100
Oh. Did your little spirit friends tell you that?

01:41.300 --> 01:44.300
No,your wedding ring did.

01:48.000 --> 01:49.400
May i?

01:53.700 --> 01:55.300
I'm getting an "M" Name.

01:55.700 --> 01:57.700
Mary ann.

01:59.600 --> 02:01.400
Who's mary ann?

02:01.900 --> 02:04.600
- It's my grandmother's name.
- You were very close, right?

02:04.700 --> 02:08.300
Well,yeah.
I mean,all little girls love their grandmas, right?

02:08.400 --> 02:11.900
No. No,this affection caused a rift.

02:12.500 --> 02:16.300
A problem. Uh,your mother's war
with her got turned against you.

02:19.100 --> 02:21.200
And your relationship with your father.

02:24.000 --> 02:25.300
He's no longer with us,is he?

02:25.400 --> 02:29.500
Hey,how about it,huh?
Just keep breathing,ok?

02:31.000 --> 02:33.200
You,sir.

02:33.400 --> 02:35.300
A very strong message about you.

02:35.500 --> 02:37.500
- You ok?
- yeah,i'm good.

02:38.600 --> 02:42.200
I'm good,i just feel like
i've had a glass of wine or 15.

02:42.600 --> 02:45.400
- Something's here.
- Like something something.

02:46.100 --> 02:48.100
No,put it into words.

02:48.500 --> 02:50.900
Put it into words that i can understand.

03:01.700 --> 03:03.800
It's ok. It's all right.

03:06.700 --> 03:09.000
Guess the spirits want you to buy my book.

03:09.100 --> 03:11.500
Is it him? Is it something he's doing?

03:11.800 --> 03:15.100
It's the ghost attached to him that he can't see.

03:15.600 --> 03:18.200
It's not a shock this guy's haunting

03:18.300 --> 03:20.600
The ghost is not a fan.

03:55.200 --> 03:56.800
ok,check this out.

03:57.000 --> 04:02.500
According to this baby name website, 48% of
women born in your grandma's time had "M" Names.

04:02.600 --> 04:06.200
Mary ann,mildred, maynard.

04:06.500 --> 04:08.800
- Maynard?
- Yeah,that's how guys like casey work.

04:08.900 --> 04:10.700
It's called a cold reading.

04:10.900 --> 04:13.100
- You've heard about things like this?
- Oh,sure.

04:13.300 --> 04:18.000
I'll start off with something like...
Ok,i'm getting an "M" Name.

04:18.100 --> 04:20.600
'cause somebody in my family
has got to have one,right?

04:20.700 --> 04:22.500
Like an aunt,cousin, or whatever.

04:22.600 --> 04:25.700
Anyway,then you take my age. You can pretty
much assume that my grandmother's passed.

04:25.800 --> 04:28.600
I throw out mary ann and presto.

04:28.700 --> 04:32.000
Ok,but how did he know that my son's name was ned?

04:32.100 --> 04:34.500
I mean,that goes beyond an educated guess.

04:34.600 --> 04:36.400
Unless you told him without realizing it.

04:36.500 --> 04:39.900
No. No way. I was very careful.
I didn't give him anything.

04:40.000 --> 04:43.900
Yeah,except for the fact that sometimes
those guys put microphones in the audience.

04:44.200 --> 04:46.200
Yeah. They'll record conversations beforehand,

04:46.300 --> 04:48.700
And then give it back to you
as if it's a part of the show.

04:48.800 --> 04:52.000
Do you see why i am skeptical
of people who have "Gifts"?

04:52.100 --> 04:55.800
Whoa. Hey.
No,not all sensitives are like that,ok?

04:55.900 --> 05:00.700
Just the ones who want to make a profit and don't
know that there's a ghost standing behind them.

05:01.000 --> 05:02.900
- Are you gonna confront him about it?
- Nope.

05:03.000 --> 05:05.500
That's a can of worms that i'm gonna keep closed.

05:05.700 --> 05:08.700
Well,maybe you are, but i'm not.

05:08.800 --> 05:10.600
Just stay in touch with your inner spirit.

05:10.700 --> 05:11.800
Thank you.

05:11.900 --> 05:13.600
- can i have your
- How you doing?

05:13.700 --> 05:14.700
yeah Thank you.

05:14.800 --> 05:16.200
- thank you
- Hi. Oh,delia.

05:16.300 --> 05:18.800
Casey. Hey,good memory.

05:19.300 --> 05:21.800
Not really.
Spirit guides told me i'd see you again.

05:21.900 --> 05:23.100
I bet they did.

05:23.200 --> 05:25.900
- Hey,can i ask you a question?
- Sure.

05:26.000 --> 05:29.500
Um,did you use a microphone
to pick up my son's name?

05:30.800 --> 05:32.800
I most certainly did not.

05:32.900 --> 05:35.500
Does it ever hurt your conscience,
doing what you do?

05:39.200 --> 05:40.700
- Excuse me.
- thanks

05:41.100 --> 05:43.900
Because people believe you,you know.
They trust you.

05:44.000 --> 05:47.500
And you just string them
along with your parlor act.

05:48.000 --> 05:50.400
What i do is no act.

05:50.500 --> 05:55.200
I've consulted with celebrities,politicians,
and no one has ever asked for their money back.

05:55.300 --> 05:57.800
Just because you convince a lot of people
doesn't mean it's true.

05:57.900 --> 06:03.400
Ok,if i am such a fraud,why have i been asked to
consult on the sydney drake disappearance?

06:03.900 --> 06:05.900
The police called you in on that?

06:06.500 --> 06:08.100
The family did.

06:08.500 --> 06:10.100
I'm gonna find this girl.

06:10.300 --> 06:14.000
And when i do,
maybe i'll make a believer out of you.

06:16.700 --> 06:18.100
Look at this family.

06:18.500 --> 06:22.200
It's just been the mom and the 2 girls
ever since the dad died a couple of years ago.

06:22.300 --> 06:24.300
- Is that sydney on the right?
- Yeah.

06:24.400 --> 06:27.800
The drake family made a small fortune
with real estate holdings in town.

06:27.900 --> 06:30.100
You know,jim was telling me something about this.

06:30.200 --> 06:32.400
And he said the police were totally frustrated

06:32.500 --> 06:36.800
'cause the night that she went missing everything
was in perfect condition.

06:36.900 --> 06:39.500
The bed was made,
cell phone and keys were on the table.

06:39.600 --> 06:42.100
And the kidnappers didn't even make any demands.

06:42.200 --> 06:45.700
No note,no clues,nothing for the police to go on.

06:46.600 --> 06:49.300
Can you imagine how that must feel?

06:49.400 --> 06:53.300
Your child just vanishes and
you have no idea what happened?

06:53.400 --> 06:55.400
Sad thing is it's been 2 weeks.

06:56.000 --> 06:58.300
In most cases,
if they haven't been found in a couple of days--

06:58.400 --> 06:59.800
Yeah,i know.

07:01.200 --> 07:06.600
There isn't any way that you could go
and talk to mrs. Drake is there?

07:06.800 --> 07:08.400
Why would i want to do that?

07:08.500 --> 07:12.400
Just because casey is gonna go there
and spin whatever story he wants.

07:12.500 --> 07:14.400
But if you get there first,you might,

07:14.900 --> 07:17.800
i don't know, see something.

07:17.900 --> 07:18.908
Wait a minute,

07:19.008 --> 07:21.531
- i thought you didn't buy what i do.
- I don't.

07:21.631 --> 07:24.800
But i buy what casey does even less.

07:26.400 --> 07:27.700
If it were me,mel,

07:28.700 --> 07:34.300
if this was my kid,the last thing i would want
is somebody lying to me about it.

07:38.800 --> 07:41.100
So,how can i help you, melinda?

07:41.900 --> 07:46.700
I know that this is none of my business.
I just don't want to see your family get hurt.

07:46.800 --> 07:49.000
Ahh,too late.

07:50.800 --> 07:53.900
I know that you're consulting with casey edgars.

07:54.400 --> 07:57.300
- You know casey's work?
- I know his type.

07:57.900 --> 08:01.200
Oh. Well,you're not the first
person to warn me about him,

08:01.300 --> 08:05.500
but he confirmed what i know in my heart--

08:05.600 --> 08:08.000
Sydney is out there.

08:08.400 --> 08:10.200
He'll tell me where she is.

08:10.800 --> 08:12.600
Look,um...

08:14.100 --> 08:17.500
I have some insight into the supernatural as well.

08:17.800 --> 08:22.500
And the casey edgars of the world are just
trying to take advantage of people's pain.

08:23.200 --> 08:28.900
It's really not as easy as just closing your eyes
and seeing where somebody is.

08:29.000 --> 08:31.900
Do you communicate with spirits?

08:34.799 --> 08:36.900
Do you know anything about sydney?

08:37.000 --> 08:40.700
No. No,i don't know anything,but...

08:41.100 --> 08:44.700
I wouldn't make you promises until i had proof.

08:46.700 --> 08:48.600
Oh,excuse me.

09:24.600 --> 09:26.000
Who's there?

09:34.100 --> 09:35.300
Hey.

09:36.700 --> 09:39.800
Hey,what do you want?
Why won't you just talk to me?

09:41.700 --> 09:42.900
Please.

09:50.000 --> 09:52.000
What are you doing in here?

09:53.000 --> 09:54.500
What happened?

09:55.000 --> 09:59.500
Uh,i--i'm sorry.I heard this strange noise.
That's why i came in here.

09:59.600 --> 10:01.400
I was talking to your mom.

10:01.500 --> 10:02.900
Yeah,i heard you two.

10:03.500 --> 10:04.900
I know exactly what you are.

10:05.000 --> 10:07.100
You're another one of those phony psychics
poking through our house.

10:07.200 --> 10:08.400
No,please,that's not what this is.

10:08.500 --> 10:11.000
It's just the feeding frenzy
doesn't stop around here.

10:11.100 --> 10:12.400
Nikki.

10:19.400 --> 10:21.500
You know,i think i've come at a bad time.

10:22.100 --> 10:25.500
But if you want to talk some more,
I'd--i really would love to help.

10:25.600 --> 10:28.500
Well,there is someone here
who would like to speak to you.

10:28.600 --> 10:29.900
Excuse me?

10:30.100 --> 10:34.200
Casey,this is the woman i
was just telling you about,

10:34.700 --> 10:36.300
Melinda gordon.

10:36.900 --> 10:38.400
We've met.

10:39.300 --> 10:40.300
So what did you do?

10:40.400 --> 10:42.800
Well,i got out of there as fast as i could.

10:42.900 --> 10:45.200
The last thing i wanted
was a showdown with the guy.

10:45.300 --> 10:46.500
And you didn't see sydney's ghost?

10:46.600 --> 10:50.000
No. I saw the ghost
that's been haunting casey instead.

10:50.100 --> 10:51.886
Wait,does that mean the
ghost is attached to you now

10:51.986 --> 10:54.074
since he knows you can see him and casey can't?

10:54.200 --> 10:55.200
i don't know.

10:55.300 --> 10:57.800
It's too hard to figure out
when he's making me this woozy.

11:00.100 --> 11:02.500
You shou have seen the look in her eyes.

11:03.000 --> 11:06.700
I mean,she was calm on the outside,
but her heart was breaking.

11:06.900 --> 11:09.300
You know,and who am i to take away her hope?

11:10.000 --> 11:13.100
Please tell me tha
what i do is not as bad as casey.

11:14.900 --> 11:18.500
What you do has nothing to do with casey.

11:51.600 --> 11:54.700
Why are you doing this to me?
What do you want?

11:56.500 --> 11:57.500
Stop it.

11:57.600 --> 11:59.900
Please,you know that i can't hear you.

12:18.600 --> 12:21.200
- are you worried?
- Am i worried about finding sydney drake?

12:22.200 --> 12:23.200
Of course.

12:24.100 --> 12:27.900
Listening to the spirits is not an exact science.
You have to be attuned to everything.

12:29.100 --> 12:33.200
You never know
what the spirits might send your way.

12:36.400 --> 12:38.300
- here you go
-  alright Keep the change.

12:39.100 --> 12:41.000
You have a ghost attached to you.

12:41.100 --> 12:42.700
Tell me something i don't already know.

12:43.100 --> 12:48.000
No,i'm not talking about your inner spirit.
I'm talking about a real ghost.

12:48.200 --> 12:51.600
He's wearing a red plaid shirt,
Loose jeans, and hiking boots.

12:51.800 --> 12:54.000
So,sounds like a ghost.

12:54.100 --> 12:55.700
You've actually seen it?

12:55.800 --> 12:59.000
Yes. And he's angry with you.
And he had a message.

12:59.100 --> 13:01.100
He wanted me to make you tell the truth.

13:01.200 --> 13:02.400
Oh,really? About what?

13:02.500 --> 13:04.000
I'm sure there could be any number of things,

13:04.100 --> 13:08.200
but i'm gonna start with the fact that you
don't know anything about where sydney drake is.

13:09.100 --> 13:11.500
Oh,i get it.

13:11.600 --> 13:14.600
I'm cutting in on your turf.
Are you the town psychic or something?

13:14.700 --> 13:16.500
Uh,this has nothing to do with turf.

13:16.600 --> 13:19.200
It has to do with 2 words--Paranormal envy.

13:19.300 --> 13:24.200
I am here because a ghost has a message for you.
You can do with that whatever you want.

13:25.300 --> 13:26.600
ok.

13:27.400 --> 13:32.000
Maybe you have a gift.
Or maybe you just think you do.

13:32.400 --> 13:34.700
But the real struggle is hiding it.

13:35.100 --> 13:39.800
You've had this gift since you were a little girl
and that's the worst time to be different.

13:40.300 --> 13:42.100
Are you a psychic or a therapist?

13:42.300 --> 13:44.200
You couldn't get rid of this gift.

13:44.300 --> 13:47.800
So you open up a nice little business.

13:47.900 --> 13:51.400
It keeps you in contact with people
who recently lost loved ones, Like,um...

13:52.400 --> 13:53.900
Selling antiques.

13:54.700 --> 13:56.200
Oh,you really are touching.

13:56.300 --> 13:58.900
I told the truth. Mission accomplished.

14:01.100 --> 14:03.600
Oh,and one more thing.

14:04.000 --> 14:06.100
Sydney drake is alive.

14:06.200 --> 14:09.200
If you're mad because i beat you to the punch,
I make no apologies.

14:09.300 --> 14:12.600
This is the big leagues.
A girl is missing.

14:13.800 --> 14:17.000
Step aside, let the professionals handle it.

14:22.700 --> 14:24.700
Hey. Wait.

14:29.700 --> 14:31.100
Nikki.

14:34.700 --> 14:36.600
I didn't mean to spy on you.

14:36.800 --> 14:40.200
There's just been so much media attention
since sydney disappeared.

14:40.600 --> 14:44.400
I definitely don't want to get recognized
checking out a so-called psychic.

14:45.700 --> 14:49.400
So,when were you listening to us
and how much did you hear?

14:49.900 --> 14:51.200
Enough.

14:53.000 --> 14:57.400
What you were saying to casey and my mom,
that you can see the dead.

14:58.700 --> 15:00.100
Is it true?

15:01.900 --> 15:03.500
Yeah,it's true.

15:04.800 --> 15:06.600
Have you seen my sister?

15:09.800 --> 15:12.000
No,i haven't.

15:13.300 --> 15:15.800
But that doesn't mean anything.

15:17.300 --> 15:18.700
It's just that...

15:21.100 --> 15:23.800
I think my sister is dead.

15:24.000 --> 15:26.500
I don't think my mother can face that.

15:27.200 --> 15:29.200
She wishes it was me.

15:29.500 --> 15:31.600
- That's not true.
- It is.

15:33.100 --> 15:36.500
My mom pushed us both,
but sydney was the one who always succeeded.

15:37.300 --> 15:39.200
She had all the brains.

15:39.300 --> 15:41.100
She sailed into medical school.

15:41.200 --> 15:44.900
- Were you two close?
- Not as close as sydney and my mother.

15:45.800 --> 15:48.700
When dad died, it just got worse.

15:49.700 --> 15:51.800
It was all about sydney.

15:52.400 --> 15:55.100
She was mommy's little princess.

15:56.700 --> 15:59.300
Sydney used to call me the toad.

16:04.600 --> 16:07.600
I'm sure that she knew how much you loved her.

16:08.300 --> 16:10.100
I need your help.

16:10.300 --> 16:13.300
Ok,explain to me again how this isn't a seance.

16:13.400 --> 16:16.600
Because the one we're
looking for is alive,i guess.

16:16.800 --> 16:18.800
Casey calls it a visitation.

16:18.900 --> 16:22.200
This guy is so pretentious
it makes me want to throw up.

16:22.300 --> 16:28.300
Oh,what i wouldn't give to see this.
The real deal vs. The real real deal.

16:36.000 --> 16:37.300
Honey?

16:38.200 --> 16:40.200
Mel? Honey?

16:40.300 --> 16:44.000
Uh...i'm gonna-- i'm gonna call you back.

17:03.500 --> 17:05.400
I am just a portal.

17:07.300 --> 17:12.800
I can feel the love and belief of everyone
in this room and so can my guides.

17:14.000 --> 17:16.099
They are here with us.

17:16.400 --> 17:18.099
Now.

17:20.200 --> 17:26.300
Every single person has
a different spirit watching over them,

17:26.500 --> 17:28.200
Protecting them.

17:28.700 --> 17:32.500
Now,show us what we seek.

17:32.600 --> 17:37.700
Please shine a lot on sydney drake,
beloved daughter, sister,friend.

17:38.500 --> 17:41.800
Please show us where she is.

17:43.800 --> 17:45.000
I see her.

17:45.400 --> 17:48.000
Where? Where is she?

17:48.100 --> 17:51.400
She's alive. She's close.

17:52.900 --> 17:54.900
There's a man next to her.

17:55.300 --> 17:58.800
A man wearing a red sweatshirt.

17:59.100 --> 18:01.200
Yes,i can see it clearly now.

18:01.300 --> 18:05.600
His shirt is red,and he's wearing hiking boots.

18:05.700 --> 18:07.200
Are you kidding me?

18:21.000 --> 18:23.100
i'm right here.

18:23.700 --> 18:26.400
I'm standing right behind you.

18:28.500 --> 18:32.700
I'm not alive, you liar. I'm dead.

18:33.700 --> 18:35.400
Sydney?

18:39.700 --> 18:41.600
you have to tell them the truth.

18:42.200 --> 18:44.400
you have to tell them that i'm dead.

18:56.100 --> 19:00.200
- Are you all right?
- Yes,i'm fine. I'm so sorry.

19:01.200 --> 19:05.200
Melinda,did you say my daughter's name?

19:07.000 --> 19:09.600
Look,i know how this is gonna sound.

19:12.000 --> 19:13.600
Yes.

19:14.700 --> 19:17.500
Sydney's spirit was here with us.

19:18.700 --> 19:21.800
And she wanted me to
tell you that she's not alive.

19:22.100 --> 19:24.100
I'm so sorry.

19:26.300 --> 19:30.500
Do not listen to her.
Your daughter is alive.

19:30.600 --> 19:33.800
This woman is trying to sabotage my work.

19:33.900 --> 19:37.600
She came to me earlier claiming i was a fraud,
and now she says she's a seer?

19:37.700 --> 19:39.100
What are you talking about?

19:39.500 --> 19:41.600
I was invited to come here.

19:41.700 --> 19:43.900
Why are you using your doubt to block me?

19:44.000 --> 19:47.700
Why have you insinuated yourself in this family,
taking away their only hope?

19:48.800 --> 19:50.300
What kind of scam are you running?

19:50.400 --> 19:54.500
I am not running any scam.
And you're the only one that's getting paid.

19:56.800 --> 19:59.000
We're not paying him.

19:59.100 --> 20:03.900
We offered him money several times,
but he said no.

20:07.600 --> 20:09.700
I know what i saw.

20:21.400 --> 20:22.700
Lower.

20:24.200 --> 20:25.900
Lower.

20:26.900 --> 20:29.300
Ooh,not that low.

20:29.700 --> 20:31.100
Casey went for blood,huh?

20:31.200 --> 20:35.600
The only thing that guy values more
than his paycheck is some good p.r.

20:35.700 --> 20:38.400
I can't believe he accused me of scamming them.

20:38.500 --> 20:40.300
I mean,why didn't i see that coming?

20:40.400 --> 20:42.500
Hey,it wasn't a total loss.

20:42.900 --> 20:44.700
At least you found out the truth about sydney.

20:44.800 --> 20:47.100
- Poor girl. She's dead,huh?
- Right.

20:47.400 --> 20:52.100
And we know that the ghost wasn't attached to
casey, that it was attached to the drake family.

20:52.500 --> 20:56.200
Yeah,but then why was she at the book signing?

20:56.400 --> 20:58.600
Because nikki was there trying to check out casey.

20:59.000 --> 21:01.500
Why would the fair
sydney drake be wearing men's clothes?

21:01.600 --> 21:02.600
i mean, Any ideas about that?

21:02.700 --> 21:06.300
None,but if that's how she's appearing to me,
then that is the clothes she died in.

21:06.400 --> 21:09.900
This sense of you feeling dizzy,
Are you still feeling that?

21:10.000 --> 21:12.200
Yeah,which makes me think that she was drugged,

21:12.300 --> 21:15.100
Which is why i go through reefer madness
every time she appears,

21:15.200 --> 21:17.300
And why she's remember things in bits and pieces.

21:17.400 --> 21:19.700
Is there any way i can talk
to one of your cop friends?

21:19.800 --> 21:21.200
On a cold case file, sure.

21:21.300 --> 21:24.100
But on an on-going investigation,
it's just not gonna happen.

21:24.600 --> 21:25.900
Sorry.

21:27.900 --> 21:30.300
- There is one person you could talk to.
- Who?

21:30.600 --> 21:32.100
Casey.

21:32.200 --> 21:33.300
Now you're on drugs.

21:33.400 --> 21:34.700
Ok,go with me for a second,all right?

21:34.800 --> 21:36.800
Look,obviously this guy's not a sensitive.

21:36.900 --> 21:39.300
But from the way you describe him,
He's a profiler.

21:39.400 --> 21:40.800
Well,maybe he's a good one.

21:40.900 --> 21:43.800
He's close to the drake family.
They probably let him talk to the cops.

21:44.100 --> 21:46.200
He might have clues he doesn't even know he has.

21:46.300 --> 21:47.600
- I hate this idea.
- Yeah,i know.

21:47.700 --> 21:50.700
But if you can get casey on your side, You might
have a better chance of crossing this ghost over,

21:50.800 --> 21:52.800
And that's really what it's all about,huh?

21:52.900 --> 21:54.700
I hate this idea.

21:56.700 --> 21:58.200
It wouldn't hurt to ask.

21:58.300 --> 22:01.900
- I hate this idea.
- Me,too, believe me.

22:03.400 --> 22:05.200
So why would i work with you on this?

22:06.000 --> 22:09.600
Because at the end of the day, it's not about us.
It's about sydney.

22:09.700 --> 22:11.100
We both want to help this family.

22:11.200 --> 22:13.700
You're good at picking up on clues about people
and their behavior,

22:13.800 --> 22:15.000
and you might see something i miss.

22:15.100 --> 22:17.500
I'm a solo act. I don't need your help.

22:17.600 --> 22:21.000
Yes,you do.
You've got nothi on sydney and you know it.

22:21.100 --> 22:22.800
I've seen her. I know she was drugged.

22:22.900 --> 22:25.600
I know that she died with
handcuffs around her wrists.

22:27.100 --> 22:30.000
You think she's dead. I think she's still alive.

22:30.100 --> 22:31.400
We're not exactly a mind meld.

22:31.500 --> 22:33.800
All the more reason to find out the truth.

22:35.200 --> 22:39.400
oh,please tell me you are not actually trying to
figure out the definition of "Truth."

22:39.500 --> 22:42.100
I'm consulting with the spirit guides.

22:42.300 --> 22:44.200
All right,tell your spirit guides this:

22:44.300 --> 22:47.000
If we find sydney,
i'll step away and you can take all the credit.

22:47.100 --> 22:50.100
If we don't,then i'll never bother you again.

22:50.900 --> 22:52.900
The spirit guides have spoken.

22:56.700 --> 22:59.800
So,your thing is crossing over,right?
Into the light?

22:59.900 --> 23:02.000
Yeah,that's my thing.

23:02.100 --> 23:03.300
What's in the light?

23:03.700 --> 23:06.100
I've never really crossed over, so i don't know.

23:06.600 --> 23:08.800
Your knowledge of the
paranormal is really limited.

23:08.900 --> 23:12.400
You should tell people
that ghosts reside on 9 planes of existence.

23:12.500 --> 23:14.300
It sounds smarter. Just a suggestion.

23:14.400 --> 23:16.500
Can we focus on the ghost,please?

23:16.800 --> 23:19.100
Right. Uh,let's see what we have--

23:19.300 --> 23:22.900
Handcuffs,drugs, outdoor clothing.
What else we got?

23:23.000 --> 23:24.200
Frogs.

23:25.000 --> 23:26.000
Excuse me?

23:26.100 --> 23:30.000
I heard them the other night out of nowhere--
Hundreds,maybe even thousands.

23:30.400 --> 23:31.400
What does that mean?

23:31.500 --> 23:33.100
I was hoping it meant something to you.

23:33.200 --> 23:36.300
It's a signal that sydney wants me to have.
I just can't figure it out.

23:36.800 --> 23:40.800
All right,well, let's forget for a moment
what frogs might mean to sydney.

23:40.900 --> 23:43.300
- What do they mean to you?
- How is that relevant?

23:44.300 --> 23:47.700
Most paranormal experiences begin
as an inward exercise.

23:47.800 --> 23:50.000
The answer might not be
some vague mystery out there.

23:50.100 --> 23:52.900
It might be some specific thing
that you already know.

23:53.000 --> 23:54.200
Like what?

23:54.700 --> 23:59.600
Maybe the spirit is trying to communicate with us
through your memories,give us a clue.

23:59.700 --> 24:02.700
- Just close your eyes.
- No.

24:04.300 --> 24:07.800
Free associate.
When you think of frogs, you think of...

24:07.900 --> 24:08.900
Gross.

24:09.400 --> 24:11.300
All right, that's a start. What else?

24:11.700 --> 24:12.900
Warts.

24:13.600 --> 24:16.100
Kermit. Girl scouts.

24:16.500 --> 24:19.700
You know, Jim and i went camping
for the first time last year,

24:19.800 --> 24:22.400
And we had to move
because the sound of the frogs was so loud.

24:22.500 --> 24:24.000
Where was that?

24:24.400 --> 24:26.300
Red mountain forest.

24:27.800 --> 24:30.100
You know,i don't mind sharing credit with you.

24:30.200 --> 24:32.500
As long as you present yourself as my prot?
Of course.

24:33.400 --> 24:35.400
- You don't like me,do you?
- Not much.

24:35.800 --> 24:37.300
Why not? I'm so likeable.

24:37.400 --> 24:38.700
I don't like what you do.

24:38.800 --> 24:41.800
Ah. You don't approve of me.
That's different. Less personal.

24:41.900 --> 24:43.600
No,it's personal.

24:44.000 --> 24:46.900
Heh. You're made
because i make a living at this and you don't?

24:47.000 --> 24:48.000
I don't want to.

24:48.100 --> 24:49.800
Oh,i do, and that makes me bad?

24:49.900 --> 24:54.000
Look,i just think it's wrong,ok?
To make up little messages from the other side.

24:54.100 --> 24:56.743
Like,"My spirit guides are
telling me that your mom and dad

24:56.926 --> 24:59.186
are really proud of you and will always love you."

24:59.400 --> 25:01.100
What if mom and dad aren't proud?

25:01.200 --> 25:05.000
What if what they  really wanted to say
was something meaningful but painful?

25:05.100 --> 25:07.200
You just tell people whatever
it is that they want to hear,

25:07.300 --> 25:08.500
And that's the part i don't approve of.

25:08.600 --> 25:12.000
Listen,i help people.
It's the best part of what i do.

25:12.100 --> 25:14.646
And the afterlife i believe in doesn't have ghosts

25:14.746 --> 25:17.302
running around spreading
terrible news to the living.

25:17.496 --> 25:21.552
So,if my gift allows me to tell right away
what someone needs to hear,

25:21.641 --> 25:23.300
what's the harm in saying it?

25:23.400 --> 25:26.100
No one has ever been helped by being lied to.

25:31.800 --> 25:35.300
Ok,this is it. This is where we went camping.

25:37.600 --> 25:39.900
- Wait. Do you hear that?
- Yeah.

25:41.600 --> 25:43.900
Ok,there's gotta be something over here.

25:48.600 --> 25:50.000
What is that?

25:50.400 --> 25:52.000
A body.

25:52.900 --> 25:54.300
It's her.

25:57.000 --> 25:59.800
- I can't go down there.
- Excuse me?

26:00.200 --> 26:03.000
I have a problem with death,
specifically,dead bodies.

26:03.200 --> 26:05.600
Casey,you said that you talk to the dead.

26:05.700 --> 26:10.100
No,i talk to spirits.
Corpses are something totally different.

26:10.200 --> 26:13.200
Ok,fine. Well,
step aside and let the professionals handle it.

26:29.500 --> 26:31.100
Is that really her?

26:31.200 --> 26:33.300
Yeah,look at her wrists.

26:35.700 --> 26:37.400
- She was held.
- Yeah.

26:37.500 --> 26:40.900
And if she was wandering around drugged,
then she escaped...

26:41.500 --> 26:44.400
I'm guessing from somewhere close by.

26:48.400 --> 26:50.400
You really saw her.

26:58.200 --> 26:59.800
Protect her.

27:07.900 --> 27:10.400
Ealing with cops. They always complicate things.

27:10.500 --> 27:12.700
You're the one who wanted to take all the credit.

27:12.900 --> 27:15.000
I don't deal with cases like these.

27:15.700 --> 27:16.800
Do you think sydney crossed over?

27:16.900 --> 27:19.300
No.
I think we only got a small piece of the puzzle.

27:19.400 --> 27:21.700
And now we have to figure out who did this to her.

27:21.900 --> 27:23.400
She said, "Protect her."

27:23.500 --> 27:24.900
- Protect who?
- I don't know.

27:25.000 --> 27:26.722
Maybe she was talking about herself. I mean,

27:26.822 --> 27:29.250
there's something there. We're just missing it.

27:29.300 --> 27:31.300
Yeah,something ways bothered me about her...

27:31.700 --> 27:34.600
The handcuffs.I mean,
there are a million easier ways to kidnap someone.

27:34.700 --> 27:35.900
Such as?

27:36.000 --> 27:38.500
Drugs,restraints-- simple coercion,even.

27:39.100 --> 27:41.300
If you're using handcuffs, you're an amateur.

27:41.600 --> 27:43.400
You didn't do  your homework.

27:43.700 --> 27:44.900
You're winging it.

27:45.500 --> 27:48.800
- You got all that from handcuffs?
- No,it's just a hunch.

27:51.700 --> 27:54.000
I really thought she was alive.

27:55.000 --> 27:57.100
I really thought i could feel it. I--

27:57.200 --> 28:00.000
Look,i think you did feel something--

28:00.200 --> 28:03.700
Her presence. It was just her ghost.

28:06.600 --> 28:07.900
Maybe i do have something.

28:08.000 --> 28:10.400
You know what? Be careful what you wish for.

28:11.100 --> 28:15.700
A lot of responsibility comes with this gift,
and it's not always just giving people hope.

28:16.300 --> 28:18.900
Sometimes you have to give them bad news.

28:19.700 --> 28:21.900
You think i should tell the drakes.

28:23.000 --> 28:25.500
It'll be easier coming from you.

28:35.600 --> 28:37.300
Jim?

28:50.200 --> 28:52.000
Time for your bathroom break.

29:45.300 --> 29:46.400
jim

29:46.500 --> 29:48.400
- no!
- Hey,no,shh,hey, It was a dream.

29:48.500 --> 29:50.000
Shh,quiet. It's all right.

29:50.100 --> 29:51.400
It was a vision--

29:52.300 --> 29:54.000
Something that happened to sydney.

29:54.100 --> 29:56.100
She was in a place, like a cabin or something.

29:56.200 --> 29:59.500
And they had her handcuffed to the bed,
and she hit a guy  with a mirror.

29:59.600 --> 30:00.500
What guy?

30:00.600 --> 30:03.300
It was the guy that was holding her,except...

30:03.700 --> 30:05.600
He had your face.

30:05.900 --> 30:08.600
- And you had to hit it with a mirror?
- No,i get it now.

30:09.000 --> 30:12.300
Casey was right.
She's using my life to tell her story.

30:12.400 --> 30:14.100
How do i fit in?

30:15.800 --> 30:19.200
She's telling me
that she was taken by someone she loved.

31:09.700 --> 31:10.900
Hello.

31:11.200 --> 31:13.000
Hey,melinda.

31:14.500 --> 31:16.800
Ok. All right,thanks.

31:24.800 --> 31:26.900
You think someone in her family killed her?

31:27.300 --> 31:28.600
Or has taken her, anyway.

31:28.700 --> 31:32.000
In the vision,she used this guy's clothes
to go through the woods.

31:32.200 --> 31:34.100
- You saw the cabin in the vision?
- No.

31:34.200 --> 31:36.000
But i've seen some just like it on red mountain.

31:36.100 --> 31:38.500
We know if the police found anything,
they'd be all over this area.

31:38.600 --> 31:41.100
Yeah,but you and i haven't been to this area.

31:47.300 --> 31:50.300
- Is this the cabin from your vision?
- It looks like it.

32:05.900 --> 32:07.100
What are you doing?

32:07.500 --> 32:11.900
Remember when you were talking about
psychic energy infusing with everyday objects?

32:12.000 --> 32:13.100
Yeah.

32:14.800 --> 32:16.800
I think you might have been right.

32:37.600 --> 32:38.600
Brandon?

32:38.700 --> 32:40.700
She can't take much more.

32:50.700 --> 32:52.300
Brandon!

33:02.700 --> 33:04.000
we have to go.

33:07.200 --> 33:09.500
We know that this is gonna
be hard for you to hear.

33:09.700 --> 33:13.100
But we wanted you to be the first
to know brandon took sydney.

33:13.700 --> 33:14.900
That's not all.

33:15.300 --> 33:16.700
He had help.

33:17.700 --> 33:19.200
Who?

33:21.000 --> 33:22.400
You.

33:24.700 --> 33:26.200
me?

33:27.000 --> 33:29.200
You think i did this to my sister?

33:29.400 --> 33:31.500
You were the forgotten child.

33:31.800 --> 33:34.100
You were living in sydney's shadow.
Even after she was gone,

33:34.200 --> 33:36.300
You still couldn't get your mother's attention.

33:36.400 --> 33:39.100
You and your boyfriend,
you planned the whole thing.

33:39.200 --> 33:41.700
You guys are so far off. You don't have a clue.

33:41.800 --> 33:44.000
Brandon is sydney's ex-boyfriend,not mine.

33:44.100 --> 33:45.800
Just tell us what happened.

33:47.200 --> 33:50.200
Sydney was not as perfect as everybody thought.

33:51.200 --> 33:53.500
I don't have to explain anything to you.

33:57.500 --> 34:00.100
The cops are gonna connect brandon's clothes.
It's only a matter of time.

34:00.200 --> 34:01.400
Wait a minute.

34:01.700 --> 34:04.300
Think about sydney's message, "Protect her."

34:04.600 --> 34:05.600
Yeah?

34:05.700 --> 34:07.900
Well,what if she meant from this?

34:08.100 --> 34:11.199
What if she meant "Protect nikki"?

34:15.000 --> 34:17.600
Will you just let me talk to you? Please--

34:20.000 --> 34:22.100
Please,look, i'm not here to judge you,ok?

34:22.199 --> 34:24.000
But you're gonna have to tell
the truth sooner or later.

34:24.100 --> 34:25.800
Not to you,i don't.

34:26.300 --> 34:28.400
I know that your sister loves you.

34:28.900 --> 34:30.600
And i know that she wants me to protect you.

34:30.699 --> 34:32.900
- How do you know that?
- Because she told me.

34:34.600 --> 34:36.500
Did you kill your sister?

34:43.699 --> 34:47.600
Do you know what the worst thing is
about being  the star of a family?

34:48.600 --> 34:50.400
The expectations.

34:50.500 --> 34:52.100
So,what happened?

34:52.600 --> 34:54.699
She started taking pills...

34:55.100 --> 34:57.500
First,so she could stay awake.

34:57.700 --> 35:00.000
Then,so she could get through finals.

35:01.200 --> 35:03.900
Then,because she couldn't live without them.

35:06.800 --> 35:10.200
By the time she got to med school,
it was,like, the perfect storm.

35:10.300 --> 35:12.800
She was pushing herself harder than she ever had.

35:12.900 --> 35:15.300
She had easier access  to prescriptions.

35:18.000 --> 35:20.527
There were times when i wondered
what my mother would think of

35:20.627 --> 35:23.586
her wonder girl turning into a drug addict.

35:24.800 --> 35:26.600
I thought about telling her.

35:27.200 --> 35:31.300
But then i just realized she would resent me
even more for bursting the bubble.

35:31.900 --> 35:33.900
I tried to cfront sydney about it.

35:34.000 --> 35:35.900
- I'll quit tomorrow. I swear.
- No,you won't!

35:36.000 --> 35:37.700
You've said that before.

35:37.800 --> 35:40.400
Please,please,i have my chem final tomorrow.
No,give me those--

35:40.500 --> 35:43.000
Don't you do that. Oh,my god,nikki!

35:43.200 --> 35:44.700
No...what did you do?!

35:44.800 --> 35:46.200
nikki,no!

35:46.400 --> 35:48.700
Nikki, what are you doing?!

35:49.100 --> 35:52.900
God! Please! Nikki!

35:54.300 --> 35:56.500
That was the last conversation we had.

35:56.600 --> 35:59.900
- How does brandon fit in?
- He went out with sydney in college.

36:01.400 --> 36:06.000
She taught him the secrets
of staying up 3 nights in a row to study.

36:06.200 --> 36:09.700
But he got addicted,too, except that he got help.

36:09.800 --> 36:13.700
Sydney didn't want to. That's why they broke up.

36:14.200 --> 36:16.000
And that's why you called him for help.

36:16.200 --> 36:19.100
I called him
because i knew how he had kicked his habit.

36:20.100 --> 36:24.000
He had some friends take him to an abandoned cabin
so he could go cold turkey.

36:24.900 --> 36:28.500
It's the hardest way to go,
but it was the only thing he could do.

36:28.600 --> 36:30.700
So,it was was never a kidnapping.

36:30.800 --> 36:32.800
It was an intervention.

36:33.100 --> 36:35.100
We thought we could do it in private.

36:35.200 --> 36:36.700
get me out of here,please!

36:36.800 --> 36:38.700
We moved her to this cabin after she passed out.

36:38.800 --> 36:39.800
Let me go!

36:39.900 --> 36:42.400
We took turns taking care of her--

36:42.600 --> 36:45.400
Feeding her, getting her through it.

36:45.700 --> 36:49.700
Who did this? Who did this?!
Get me out of here!

36:49.800 --> 36:52.300
I went out for an hour, just to get some air.

36:52.400 --> 36:54.000
Time for your bathroom break.

36:54.300 --> 36:56.000
- But when i did...
- Brandon,no.

36:56.100 --> 36:59.600
Brandon took her to the bathroom and she hit him.

37:02.500 --> 37:05.000
She put his clothes on and left.

37:05.300 --> 37:09.100
We searched for hours...days.

37:10.000 --> 37:11.800
But we couldn't find her.

37:11.900 --> 37:13.900
Why didn't you call the police?

37:14.000 --> 37:17.100
We just kept telling ourselves
that she would show up...

37:17.500 --> 37:20.000
Back at school or home.

37:20.600 --> 37:23.000
Then it just started to snowball.

37:23.300 --> 37:28.000
We didn't want my mom knowing
what was wrong with sydney.

37:29.200 --> 37:31.800
And i didn't want her knowing what i had done.

37:33.100 --> 37:35.600
I knew mom would really hate me

37:36.900 --> 37:40.200
if anything happened to sydney because of me.

37:41.700 --> 37:43.500
And then she called the police.

37:44.800 --> 37:47.000
And i was so scared.

37:49.100 --> 37:51.100
I didn't know what to do.

37:54.100 --> 37:56.500
So,i did nothing.

37:57.300 --> 37:58.800
I don't believe you.

37:59.000 --> 38:01.300
I would have known
if sydney had a problem like that.

38:01.400 --> 38:03.100
She would have told me. I would have seen it.

38:03.200 --> 38:04.800
No,you wouldn't have,mom.

38:04.900 --> 38:07.100
You only saw flaws in me, not sydney.

38:07.200 --> 38:09.800
- That's not true.
- It is.

38:10.800 --> 38:12.400
It is true.

38:15.000 --> 38:16.100
Susan...

38:17.000 --> 38:19.800
Sydney is here with us, right now.

38:20.400 --> 38:22.900
And she wants you to listen to nikki.

38:23.600 --> 38:26.400
No. This is some trick.

38:26.500 --> 38:29.800
The two of you couldn't stand each other,
and now you're working together?

38:30.800 --> 38:32.400
I trusted you.

38:32.600 --> 38:36.300
But you are a fraud and a liar, just like the rest.

38:36.400 --> 38:39.900
If i wanted to lie to you,
I'd tell you what you want to hear.

38:40.000 --> 38:42.000
Get out of my house.

38:42.300 --> 38:43.400
Now.

38:44.600 --> 38:46.600
Tell her it's time for
the training wheels to come off.

38:46.700 --> 38:49.600
She says it's time for
the training wheels to come off.

38:54.300 --> 38:56.700
That's something my dad used to say...

38:58.700 --> 39:02.900
Whenever someone was
complaining something was too hard.

39:05.100 --> 39:07.700
I know how difficult this must be for you.

39:08.100 --> 39:10.500
But sydney does have a message for you.

39:10.600 --> 39:12.800
She can't move on until you hear it.

39:25.600 --> 39:27.600
I know nikki was trying to help me.

39:28.000 --> 39:31.400
I couldn't find my way through those woods.
I just fell.

39:32.100 --> 39:34.000
Please tell her to believe me.

39:35.400 --> 39:37.700
She knows that you were just trying to help her

39:37.800 --> 39:40.200
and everything that happened wasn't your fault.

39:40.800 --> 39:43.000
I don't deserve that.

39:43.900 --> 39:46.100
I don't deserve forgiveness.

39:47.400 --> 39:49.600
She lost so much because of me.

39:49.800 --> 39:50.819
And that's why i had to stay here.

39:50.819 --> 39:53.211
I had to make sure
mom wouldn't be too hard on her,

39:53.500 --> 39:55.600
Wouldn't see her as a disappointment.

39:56.700 --> 39:58.700
She doesn't want you to blame nikki.

40:01.800 --> 40:04.300
Nikki did what she did because she loved me.

40:04.900 --> 40:08.900
Even though mom always put her second,
even though  she lived in my shadow,

40:09.500 --> 40:11.300
She looked out for me.

40:11.900 --> 40:14.300
Tell her nikki needs her now more than ever.

40:16.300 --> 40:20.100
I want my mom to see her, to know her...

40:21.900 --> 40:26.900
Not who my mom wants her to be, but who she is.

40:28.500 --> 40:30.300
It's her turn now.

40:30.700 --> 40:32.400
I'll tell her.

40:36.900 --> 40:39.400
You were always the princess.

40:42.100 --> 40:44.200
I was the toad.

40:59.200 --> 41:01.100
I think i can go now.

41:02.200 --> 41:05.500
She's ready to cross over.

41:12.300 --> 41:14.300
Bye-bye,sweetheart.

41:16.700 --> 41:18.600
Tell them i'm happy now.

41:19.300 --> 41:21.300
They should be,too.

41:26.700 --> 41:30.100
She's happy now. She's at peace.

41:32.100 --> 41:34.800
There are some things she wanted us to tell you...

41:36.700 --> 41:38.800
go from your heart.

41:42.500 --> 41:44.300
<i>{a6}Sarah Mclachlan "world on fire"</i>

41:44.100 --> 41:47.000
Sydney loves you.

41:55.100 --> 41:58.300
I just don't know how to describe that experience

41:58.500 --> 42:00.800
So simple but yet so profound.

42:01.400 --> 42:05.200
No smoke and mirrors,
just people trying to reach out to each other.

42:05.300 --> 42:07.700
Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't.

42:08.500 --> 42:09.900
Nikki gonna be ok?

42:10.200 --> 42:11.400
Yeah,i think so.

42:11.500 --> 42:14.000
County said they wouldn't file any charges.

42:15.100 --> 42:19.200
You know,if i could do what you do,
I would shout it from the rooftops.

42:19.600 --> 42:24.700
In fact, i can't do what you do,
but i still shout it from the rooftops.

42:26.200 --> 42:28.300
You have a gift, you kn--

42:28.900 --> 42:33.600
An instinct about people,
to make them see things they're not aware of.

42:34.700 --> 42:36.900
I couldn't have done this without you.

42:38.400 --> 42:39.500
Thank you.

42:39.600 --> 42:41.200
Uh,excuse me, are you casey edgars?

42:41.300 --> 42:44.400
- Uh,yes.
- Oh,can i...please?
