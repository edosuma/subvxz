I made a deal with Pope.

37:49.143 --> 37:52.396
You made a deal with Pope?
What kind of deal?

37:52.563 --> 37:56.483
If he came with us,
and if we got what we needed...

37:57.067 --> 37:58.735
...I said I'd turn myself in.

37:58.902 --> 38:02.072
What? We don't even know
what this thing is.

38:02.239 --> 38:05.075
It could be nothing, Michael.
You know about this?

38:05.576 --> 38:07.244
Not until it came out of his mouth.

38:07.369 --> 38:09.746
MICHAEL:
It was the only thing I could think of.

38:09.913 --> 38:13.917
You two can still finish this.
You'll just have to do it without me.

38:14.418 --> 38:18.088
I'm not gonna let you do this, Michael.
There's no coming back from this.

38:21.341 --> 38:23.635
- Now, look.
- What's the holdup?

38:23.802 --> 38:25.095
Your brother's right.

38:25.262 --> 38:29.308
I wouldn't count on the courts
to show you any leniency in this.

38:30.809 --> 38:33.729
That doesn't matter.
I said I'd hold up my end of the deal.

38:33.896 --> 38:36.315
You already did.

38:37.649 --> 38:41.111
I listened to this.
You have something here.

38:41.778 --> 38:45.282
There are gonna be a lot of people
who wish you didn't, but you do.

38:45.449 --> 38:47.451
- Listen, Henry--
- I'd go now, if I were you.

38:48.035 --> 38:50.621
And don't consider this forgiveness.

38:50.787 --> 38:54.666
In fact, I'm about 1O seconds away
from changing my mind.

38:55.792 --> 38:57.878
Thank you.

39:13.310 --> 39:15.145
FRANKLIN:
Okay.

39:18.857 --> 39:20.734
Here, let's...

39:21.860 --> 39:25.489
Let's tuck you in, all right? Okay?

39:29.326 --> 39:31.328
Come on, let's go.

39:39.753 --> 39:43.757
Listen, let's just sit
for a little bit longer, okay?

39:46.260 --> 39:49.179
We're gonna go in a little bit, okay?

40:07.489 --> 40:10.909
You know Daddy loves you
with all his heart, right?

40:11.076 --> 40:13.537
I love you so much.

40:13.704 --> 40:16.290
I'm so sorry.

40:17.374 --> 40:20.002
I'm so sorry, baby.

40:39.104 --> 40:40.897
MAHONE: <i>Yeah?</i>
- I got a call for you.

40:41.064 --> 40:43.650
I'll call back.
I just heard from some clinic up north.

40:43.817 --> 40:46.153
They had contact with Franklin
half an hour ago.

40:46.320 --> 40:47.654
I think you want to take this.

40:49.698 --> 40:51.575
Put it through.

40:52.701 --> 40:54.036
Yeah? Mahone.

40:54.202 --> 40:57.539
FRANKLIN: Is this the man in charge?
- Oh, <i>yeah.</i>

40:57.706 --> 41:04.212
My name is Benjamin Miles Franklin.

41:06.548 --> 41:08.550
And I wanna turn myself in.

41:08.717 --> 41:10.594
<i>But I got one condition.</i>

41:10.761 --> 41:13.430
<i>My wife, well, she goes free.</i>

41:14.056 --> 41:16.224
My little daughter, she needs her mother.

41:17.893 --> 41:21.021
I don't think I need to make
a deal with you, Mr. Franklin.

41:24.024 --> 41:26.109
What if I got something you need?

42:05.649 --> 42:09.486
Your wife was released an hour ago.
She'll be here soon.

42:09.653 --> 42:12.489
Promise me that she will be okay.

42:18.995 --> 42:21.748
Just hold up your end of the deal.

42:23.875 --> 42:25.711
I Will.

42:28.880 --> 42:31.508
I'll get you Scofield.

42:51.528 --> 42:53.530
Here we go.

42:59.202 --> 43:02.038
You think it's a conversation?

43:02.205 --> 43:03.582
One they don't want us to hear.

43:06.168 --> 43:08.712
- You ready?
- Let's do it.

43:57.135 --> 43:59.221
