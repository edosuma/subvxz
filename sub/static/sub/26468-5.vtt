Andi Mack...

00:04.880 --> 00:06.380
(giggling)

00:06.380 --> 00:07.880
Can you even believe this?

00:07.880 --> 00:09.960
I know. People still
buy albums?

00:09.960 --> 00:12.120
No, I mean, our invention.

00:12.120 --> 00:14.380
The no-breakup breakup.
It works.

00:14.380 --> 00:16.290
I mean, look at us,
hanging out with no drama.

00:16.290 --> 00:17.380
I know. It's fun.

00:17.380 --> 00:19.880
Sean's got talent,
like, a gift.

00:19.880 --> 00:20.830
He needs the right teacher.

00:20.830 --> 00:22.380
And it sounds
like that's you.

00:22.380 --> 00:24.330
Let's try a C.

00:24.330 --> 00:25.500
(strums badly)

00:25.500 --> 00:26.920
-You're not--
-Wait.

00:26.920 --> 00:28.380
-Look--
-Hold on.

00:28.380 --> 00:31.210
(playing badly)

00:31.210 --> 00:33.120
-Wanna go shopping?
-What are we shopping for?

00:33.120 --> 00:35.880
New wallet,
maybe register you
for some flatware.

00:35.880 --> 00:37.960
Ah, there it is.
The truth.

00:37.960 --> 00:40.460
We have to talk about
this wedding sooner or later.

00:40.460 --> 00:41.750
I'm not registering.

00:41.750 --> 00:42.960
Why do I even try?

00:42.960 --> 00:45.250
Buffy says you feel
weird around me.

00:45.250 --> 00:46.750
She told you that?

00:46.750 --> 00:48.290
She had to explain why
I couldn't come

00:48.290 --> 00:49.750
to the Color Factory
with her today.

00:49.750 --> 00:51.960
We could go together.

00:51.960 --> 00:54.460
Did you not get enough
awkwardness just now?

00:54.460 --> 00:55.500
Good point.

00:55.500 --> 00:56.500
What happened?

00:56.500 --> 00:59.170
Andi: They are having
a blast without me.

00:59.170 --> 01:00.080
Why aren't you there?

01:00.080 --> 01:01.790
I can't be with Buffy

01:01.790 --> 01:03.460
when she's with Walker.

01:03.460 --> 01:05.790
And she'd rather be
with Walker than with me.

01:10.750 --> 01:12.580
Bowie! Let's go!

01:12.580 --> 01:15.290
Chill. There's like twenty
minutes of trailers.

01:15.290 --> 01:17.170
And I don't want to miss them.

01:17.170 --> 01:20.040
FYI, I'm in charge
of popcorn this time.

01:20.040 --> 01:21.750
What do you mean
you're in charge?

01:21.750 --> 01:22.750
That's my job.

01:22.750 --> 01:24.880
He thinks he's
the Popcorn Kernel.

01:24.880 --> 01:27.460
The official title
is Colonel Popcorn.

01:27.460 --> 01:30.120
Well, you've been demoted.
You're now Napkin Getter.

01:30.120 --> 01:31.290
What? Why?

01:31.290 --> 01:32.620
You over-butter.

01:32.620 --> 01:33.750
No, I don't.

01:33.750 --> 01:35.460
Oh please,
you work that pump

01:35.460 --> 01:36.960

to revive a dead man.

01:36.960 --> 01:38.460
So we're just
gonna eat it plain?

01:38.460 --> 01:40.540
No, we're gonna get chocolate
and we're gonna mix it in.

01:40.540 --> 01:42.710
No, we're not.

01:43.710 --> 01:46.120
Well, you know
the butter is free.

01:46.120 --> 01:48.040
Well, you get what you
pay for, Colonel.

01:50.500 --> 01:52.830

He seem's like a nice guy.

03:26.120 --> 03:27.290

Sure. I'll try it.

03:29.000 --> 03:30.920

Are we canoe people?

03:30.920 --> 03:32.000

03:49.120 --> 03:50.540

03:50.540 --> 03:52.000
to the meet things head

03:54.790 --> 03:55.790
I better go with him.

03:55.790 --> 03:57.000
Yeah, you better.

04:44.420 --> 04:46.380
Spending time

04:46.380 --> 04:47.920
Are you here by yourself?

04:47.920 --> 04:50.500
It's so rare to see
one of you separated
from the herd.

04:50.500 --> 04:53.120
My friends are in canoes.

04:54.710 --> 04:55.830
Amber: Not a fan?

04:55.830 --> 04:58.540
No. I'm not
opposed to canoeing.

04:58.540 --> 05:00.710
But it takes two to canoe.

05:01.960 --> 05:05.080
Ever realize if you
say a word over and over
and over again,

05:05.080 --> 05:07.040

05:07.040 --> 05:09.420
Canoe. Canoe. Canoe.

05:09.420 --> 05:10.460
Canoe.

05:10.460 --> 05:11.420
Now I understand
why nobody

05:11.420 --> 05:12.670
wants to canoe
with you.

05:12.670 --> 05:15.290
Ah! They wanted to!

05:16.290 --> 05:17.330
But...

05:18.380 --> 05:19.670
(all laughing)

05:19.670 --> 05:21.710
I get it.
You're the third wheel.

05:21.710 --> 05:23.000
No.

05:24.040 --> 05:25.000
I'm the fifth.

05:27.880 --> 05:28.960
Is it fun?

05:30.790 --> 05:32.210
Is it better than
sitting here?

05:38.290 --> 05:40.380
Oaring is boring.

05:41.380 --> 05:44.040
You know what would
make this experience better?

05:44.040 --> 05:45.620
If you keep
complaining about it.

05:50.210 --> 05:52.170
Can we at least try
to hit the other canoes?

05:52.170 --> 05:55.040
This isn't bumper boats.

05:55.040 --> 05:56.920
It could be,
if we close the distance.

05:58.670 --> 06:00.290
Come on, come on.

06:00.290 --> 06:01.710
We have to build up
ramming speed.

06:05.960 --> 06:08.040
Not that one!
We cannot hit that one!

06:18.210 --> 06:19.790
How did that happen?

06:19.790 --> 06:20.960
How did what happen?

06:22.170 --> 06:24.080
Buffy:
Andi's in a canoe
with Amber.

06:24.080 --> 06:26.080
Is that a bad thing?

06:26.080 --> 06:27.080
No.

06:27.080 --> 06:28.960
Well, is it a good thing?

06:28.960 --> 06:30.080
No.

06:30.080 --> 06:33.330
See, Amber is this girl
who used to be mean to us,

06:33.330 --> 06:34.420
and she's still
kind of mean,

06:34.420 --> 06:35.750
but now she's like
our mean friend.

06:35.750 --> 06:39.120
Well, I guess that's
an improvement.

06:39.120 --> 06:42.790
Well, friend
is a strong word...

06:42.790 --> 06:44.380
she's basically
our waitress

06:44.380 --> 06:46.210
that we never
order hamburgers from.

06:46.210 --> 06:48.120
Oh. Great. Now I know
exaclty how to feel

06:48.120 --> 06:49.540
about seeing her
in a boat with Andi.

06:50.790 --> 06:51.960
Who's that with Buffy?

06:51.960 --> 06:53.960
It's a long story.

06:55.620 --> 06:56.960
We paid for an hour.

07:03.960 --> 07:05.170
(grunting)

07:13.000 --> 07:14.750
You're doing great, Cyrus!

07:14.750 --> 07:16.580
Look at us go!

07:16.580 --> 07:18.620
It's just you going.

07:18.620 --> 07:20.000
Huh?

07:20.000 --> 07:21.330
I lost my paddle.

07:21.330 --> 07:22.420
What?

07:22.420 --> 07:23.830
It's back there.

07:26.710 --> 07:28.080
(grunting)

07:30.790 --> 07:33.250
Bowie:
I have another lesson
with that Shaun kid today.

07:33.250 --> 07:36.210
Maybe I just don't
have what it takes
to be a good teacher.

07:36.210 --> 07:39.080
Well, that's a pretty
dramatic thing to say
after one lesson.

07:39.080 --> 07:40.830
You didn't hear him.

07:40.830 --> 07:44.210
The Beatles song,
"While My Guitar Gently
Weeps" came to mind.

07:44.210 --> 07:46.210
Not because he sounded
like the Beatles.

07:46.210 --> 07:48.670
He didn't.

07:48.670 --> 07:50.250
Maybe it's because he's nine?

07:51.710 --> 07:52.830
What are you doing to my hair?

07:52.830 --> 07:54.830
Shh. Go with it.

07:54.830 --> 07:57.250
I think I was just
kidding myself

07:57.250 --> 07:59.120
being a guitar teacher,
because of Jonah.

08:00.460 --> 08:02.830
You know,
but that wasn't me,
that was him.

08:02.830 --> 08:04.040
So what are you gonna do?

08:05.040 --> 08:06.620
I was hoping you'd tell me.

08:06.620 --> 08:09.500
Well, it's too early
to give up.

08:12.040 --> 08:13.500
Give me a timetable.

08:13.500 --> 08:14.670
When am I allowed to give up?

08:18.620 --> 08:19.500
No.

08:19.500 --> 08:21.540
Hey, who's the hair artist
here,

08:21.540 --> 08:22.380
me or you?

08:23.670 --> 08:25.080
Have you tried
everything with this kid?

08:25.080 --> 08:28.040
Because I'm sure
you still have some tricks
in your guitar case.

08:28.040 --> 08:29.880
It's so hard!

08:29.880 --> 08:32.040
I just want to teach people
who don't need teaching!

08:32.040 --> 08:37.040
Too bad, because you are
in it to Quinn it!

08:38.380 --> 08:39.380
Out.

08:40.420 --> 08:41.460
Out.

08:46.250 --> 08:49.210
Okay, so you told Walker
you were with Jonah

08:49.210 --> 08:50.920
and you couldn't
see him anymore?

08:52.080 --> 08:55.750
And now Buffy,
your best friend,
is with him?

08:55.750 --> 08:57.460
Not with with.

08:57.460 --> 08:59.080
She's with him.

08:59.080 --> 09:01.420
Yeah.

09:01.420 --> 09:03.460
She broke girl code.

09:05.210 --> 09:07.330
She broke girl code?

09:11.080 --> 09:13.120
What exactly is the code?

09:13.120 --> 09:14.920
You don't know
what girl code is?

09:14.920 --> 09:16.420
I mean, I've heard of it.

09:16.420 --> 09:18.670
But it never really mattered.

09:18.670 --> 09:20.080
Until now.

09:20.080 --> 09:22.080
Do you know the first
rule of girl code?

09:22.080 --> 09:24.290
Don't talk about girl code.

09:24.290 --> 09:26.120
No, that's stupid.

09:26.120 --> 09:28.420
How would anybody
find out about it?

09:28.420 --> 09:29.460
You don't go out
with someone

09:29.460 --> 09:31.000
after they've been out
with your best friend.

09:31.000 --> 09:32.380
But I was never
really with him --

09:32.380 --> 09:34.460
You were and now she is,

09:34.460 --> 09:37.330
and that is the number one
violation of girl code.

09:40.210 --> 09:42.120
I knew something felt off.

09:42.120 --> 09:43.460
Now you know what.

09:43.460 --> 09:45.330
I mean, I thought
I was the problem.

09:45.330 --> 09:46.460
She's the problem.

09:46.460 --> 09:47.790
And this is official?

09:47.790 --> 09:49.330
It's not just
your interpretation?

09:49.330 --> 09:52.290
This is a code
that's been passed
down for generations.

09:52.290 --> 09:55.250
Wow, this is so eye-opening.

09:55.250 --> 09:57.670
Andi, I think we're sinking.

09:57.670 --> 10:01.250
Yeah! We are!
We're totally in sync!

10:01.250 --> 10:04.830
No! Like, we're sinking.
Look!

10:05.830 --> 10:08.080
Oh, so that's what you
meant by "sinking."

10:18.670 --> 10:20.120
Amber! Stop paddling!

10:20.120 --> 10:21.330
I'm getting us to shore!

10:21.330 --> 10:23.330
No, you're not.

10:23.330 --> 10:25.120
Let's just abandon ship.

10:25.120 --> 10:27.170
Abandon?
What does that mean?

10:27.170 --> 10:28.170
Where do I go?

10:28.170 --> 10:29.330
The water.

10:29.330 --> 10:30.790
I can't go in the water!

10:30.790 --> 10:32.460
We're in the water.

10:32.460 --> 10:33.920
I don't want to die here!

10:33.920 --> 10:35.540
You're wearing a life vest!

10:37.670 --> 10:38.670
Oh, yeah.

10:38.670 --> 10:40.830
And we're three feet
from shore.

10:45.250 --> 10:47.500
(gasps)
No, don't!

10:47.500 --> 10:49.380
Andi:
You don't stand in a canoe!

10:49.380 --> 10:50.880
Amber:
Why didn't you tell me!

10:50.880 --> 10:54.290
I thought you knew!
First rule of canoeing--

10:54.290 --> 10:55.460
Don't go canoeing!

fun thing I've ever done.

11:20.170 --> 11:22.960

something different.

11:41.750 --> 11:43.460
Now, get loose.
Shake out your arms.

Okay.

11:48.420 --> 11:49.880
-You're playing this today.
-Okay.

11:49.880 --> 11:51.380
An electric guitar.

11:51.380 --> 11:52.920
Now you should
say "Rock on!"

11:52.920 --> 11:54.040
Okay.

11:54.040 --> 11:55.120
No, say it!

(unenthused)
Rock on.

we're learning today.

rock god and just...

12:27.540 --> 12:29.120
Go for it! Just...

12:30.670 --> 12:31.960
(play chords poorly)

12:33.380 --> 12:34.920
(sighs)

12:34.920 --> 12:36.580
I can't do it.

12:37.960 --> 12:39.580
I'm so sorry, Shaun.

12:39.580 --> 12:41.330
I want to be
your guitar teacher,

12:41.330 --> 12:44.670
but I obviously
can't teach guitar.

12:46.120 --> 12:48.120
It's not you, it's me.

12:49.330 --> 12:52.000
You're a sweet kid,
but you don't have
to protect me.

12:52.000 --> 12:54.080
No, it really is me.

12:55.080 --> 12:56.620
I don't want to play guitar.

12:56.620 --> 12:58.620
What?

12:58.620 --> 13:00.710
My dad wants me
to play guitar.

13:04.710 --> 13:06.210
But you don't want to?

13:06.210 --> 13:07.290
Correct.

13:12.670 --> 13:14.040
Yes!

13:14.040 --> 13:15.830
Whoo!

13:15.830 --> 13:17.420
Do you know what that is?

13:17.420 --> 13:20.290
That is the sweet sound of me
believing in myself again.

13:20.290 --> 13:21.830
Ha!

13:21.830 --> 13:22.880
I thought I lost it,

13:22.880 --> 13:24.500
but it's back!

13:24.500 --> 13:28.290
That's cool, but you still
have to give me guitar lessons.

13:31.290 --> 13:33.080
Dude, I can't do that.

13:33.080 --> 13:34.670
You gotta tell
your dad the truth.

13:34.670 --> 13:36.830
Dude, I can't do that.

13:36.830 --> 13:39.830
If I could, I wouldn't be
sitting here with
a brand-new guitar

13:39.830 --> 13:42.580
trying to learn how to play
"Smoke On The Water."

13:42.580 --> 13:44.540
Which makes no sense.

13:44.540 --> 13:47.580
Why would there be
smoke on the water?

13:47.580 --> 13:48.920
Do they mean fog?

13:52.000 --> 13:53.580
Well, here's an idea.

13:53.580 --> 13:56.000
How about
we do it together?

13:56.000 --> 13:57.380
And you'll tell him?

13:57.380 --> 13:59.500
No, that's still your job.

13:59.500 --> 14:01.250
Aww.

14:05.460 --> 14:06.620
(knocking)

14:14.250 --> 14:16.080
Mom! What are
you doing here?

14:16.080 --> 14:18.210
I have come to take
you cake-tasting.

14:18.210 --> 14:20.080
Ooh! Just for fun?

14:20.080 --> 14:22.380
No, for the wedding.

14:22.380 --> 14:24.420
You know
my feelings on this.

14:24.420 --> 14:26.830
I don't want
to get sucked into
a decision-making vortex

14:26.830 --> 14:29.210
for a super fancy party
that only you want.

14:29.210 --> 14:30.620
I do know that.

14:30.620 --> 14:33.000
I was only asking you
to be polite.

14:33.000 --> 14:34.000
Andi!

14:36.170 --> 14:37.830
CeCe! What's up?

14:37.830 --> 14:40.750
Would you like to go
with me to taste cakes
for your mother's wedding?

14:40.750 --> 14:43.500
Of course I would!
Who could say no to that?

14:43.500 --> 14:44.710
The bride.

14:44.710 --> 14:47.040
Well, it's her loss.

14:47.040 --> 14:49.960
I will be right back.
I just need to put on
my cake pants.

14:49.960 --> 14:51.170
Where are they?

14:51.170 --> 14:53.250
Right next to my pie shorts.

You need to pace yourself.

15:48.790 --> 15:50.330
At least we're finished.

15:51.380 --> 15:52.420
And we found one.

15:54.000 --> 15:55.000
Both:
That one.

15:57.040 --> 15:58.620
Wait.

15:58.620 --> 16:00.790
No. Not that one.

16:00.790 --> 16:01.790
This one.

16:01.790 --> 16:03.540
That one is too rich.

16:03.540 --> 16:05.670
That one is too spongy.

16:05.670 --> 16:06.750
It's fluffier!

16:06.750 --> 16:10.080
It's not chocolate.
It automatically loses.

16:10.080 --> 16:11.330

16:11.330 --> 16:12.920
-I did.
-So did I.

16:12.920 --> 16:14.620
Well, we need to
make a decision.

16:18.460 --> 16:20.670
This is why Bex
didn't want to do this.

16:22.040 --> 16:24.420

16:50.920 --> 16:52.620
You were supposed to decide.

16:52.620 --> 16:53.710
We couldn't.

16:53.710 --> 16:56.380
It turns out tasting cake
is not a cakewalk.

16:56.380 --> 16:58.460
Well, that's the job
you signed up for.

16:58.460 --> 17:01.670
For Pete's sake,
I have butter cream
coursing through my veins!

17:01.670 --> 17:03.420

now you need to eat it too!

to bride! Woo-hoo!

It's the sugar talking.

17:10.290 --> 17:12.380
Okay, I said I didn't
wanna decide,

17:12.380 --> 17:13.580
so you said you'd decide,

17:13.580 --> 17:14.790
but you couldn't,

17:14.790 --> 17:16.620
so now you're
forcing me to decide.

17:17.880 --> 17:18.920
Alright.

17:28.670 --> 17:29.920
What is she doing?

17:31.380 --> 17:32.750
I'm making a decision.

17:33.750 --> 17:36.540
That one. That will be
my wedding cake.

17:36.540 --> 17:39.380
-No, no, no.
You can't do that.
-It doesn't count.

17:39.380 --> 17:41.080
You said I had to pick,
so I picked.

17:43.330 --> 17:45.210
She is impossible.

17:45.210 --> 17:47.120
I mean, we did this for her.

17:47.120 --> 17:48.790
That was work what we did.

17:48.790 --> 17:51.290
And she can't do us
the simple courtesy
of one forkful!

17:51.290 --> 17:53.380
I mean, it's just
completely--

17:55.620 --> 17:57.460
Her wedding,
her rules, right?

17:57.460 --> 18:00.290
She picked yours!

18:00.290 --> 18:03.330
Oh, did she? Huh.
I guess she did.

18:05.330 --> 18:07.170

-Mm-hm.

18:43.750 --> 18:47.420

I picked this one!

he wants to tell you.

19:14.170 --> 19:15.460
Bowie?

19:15.460 --> 19:16.620
Shaun?

19:16.620 --> 19:17.880
Bowie?

19:17.880 --> 19:19.250
Victor.

19:19.250 --> 19:22.540
All right. We're all here.
What's the news?

19:22.540 --> 19:25.210
Shaun doesn't want
to play guitar.

19:27.040 --> 19:28.040
Yes he does.

19:29.120 --> 19:30.120
Yes I do!

19:33.460 --> 19:34.460
No, I don't.

19:38.750 --> 19:40.040
Why didn't you say something?

19:41.040 --> 19:42.710
Because you wanted
me to play guitar.

19:46.380 --> 19:47.540
Do you play?

19:47.540 --> 19:49.170
Oh yeah!

19:49.170 --> 19:50.000
Air guitar!

19:51.170 --> 19:52.330

19:58.000 --> 19:59.750

G'night, everybody!

20:02.080 --> 20:04.750
So... no.

20:04.750 --> 20:06.330
Why not?

20:06.330 --> 20:10.420
When I was a kid
I wasn't cool enough
and now it's too late.

20:10.420 --> 20:11.960
It's never too late!

20:11.960 --> 20:14.250
-(sighs)
-Pft. Come on.

20:25.040 --> 20:26.380

20:26.380 --> 20:27.500

20:27.500 --> 20:28.750
I'm teaching!

20:30.250 --> 20:31.460
Rock on!

20:31.460 --> 20:33.460
(strumming chords)

20:38.880 --> 20:40.960
I promise you, this is the best
grilled cheese sandwich

20:40.960 --> 20:42.420
you will ever have
in your life!

20:44.290 --> 20:46.620
Extra napkins!
You are definitely
going to need some.

20:48.290 --> 20:50.040
Should we text Andi?

20:50.040 --> 20:51.790
I want to.

20:51.790 --> 20:52.960
But do you think
she'd want to come?

20:55.210 --> 20:56.960
Let's just bring her
next time.

20:56.960 --> 20:58.040
Andi: Oh. Hey, guys!

20:59.040 --> 21:00.460
Or this time.

21:00.460 --> 21:01.620
Buffy: Hey!

21:01.620 --> 21:02.960
We were just
about to text you.

21:02.960 --> 21:04.330
Well, here I am.

21:04.330 --> 21:05.620
Hey, Andi!

21:05.620 --> 21:06.960
Hey, Walker!

21:06.960 --> 21:07.830
What'd you get?

21:07.830 --> 21:09.330
Here, have some!

21:09.330 --> 21:10.460
-Oh, I--
-Hey, guys.

21:11.710 --> 21:13.000
-Amber.
-Room for one more.

21:13.000 --> 21:15.330
It's okay. We're going
the lobster roll truck.

21:16.670 --> 21:17.830
Would you rather stay here?

21:17.830 --> 21:20.830
No, we are getting
a french fry lobster roll!

21:20.830 --> 21:22.290
Let's go!

21:22.290 --> 21:24.750
-Okay, bye guys.
-Bye!

21:24.750 --> 21:25.920
Huh.

21:27.620 --> 21:29.000
I feel ditched.

21:29.000 --> 21:31.620
But we didn't invite her
in the first place.

21:31.620 --> 21:32.710
I know.

21:41.120 --> 21:42.460
Next on
Andi Mack...

21:42.460 --> 21:44.500
-Mom!
-Cookie!

21:44.500 --> 21:46.290
Let me fix you
kids something.

21:46.290 --> 21:47.670
I'll holler when
dinner's ready.

21:47.670 --> 21:49.040
I love Cookie but...

21:49.040 --> 21:51.460
It's like she has them
under some kinda spell.

21:51.460 --> 21:53.330
-What is happening?
-They're lovies.

21:53.330 --> 21:54.960
They're one of
Cookie's specialties.

21:54.960 --> 21:57.500
You two are really
starting to scare me.

21:57.500 --> 21:59.620
Mommy! We need help!

21:59.620 --> 22:00.790
Cyrus! Wanna hang out?

22:00.790 --> 22:01.920
-With you?
-And my friends.

22:01.920 --> 22:03.790
Hey! You made it.

22:03.790 --> 22:05.380
You should see your
face right now, bro.

22:05.380 --> 22:06.880
-Do you know
what's in that bag?
-Yeah.

22:06.880 --> 22:09.290
I'm gonna go.
I think you should too.
