<i>Previously on "Superstition"...</i>

00:08.571 --> 00:09.733
Welcome home, son.

00:09.954 --> 00:11.400
I wanna help out with the business.

00:11.433 --> 00:12.762
You can just skip back in here.

00:12.787 --> 00:13.818
This is ancient.

00:13.843 --> 00:15.862
A coin that powerful,
that doesn't just get out there.

00:15.887 --> 00:17.536
Would it had killed you to let
me know I had a daughter?

00:17.561 --> 00:18.965
'Cause I'm the daughter you left behind.

00:18.990 --> 00:22.314
This is the work of an infernal
more powerful than we've ever seen.

00:22.339 --> 00:24.117
- I came back to save you.
- I'm gonna be just fine.

00:24.189 --> 00:25.722
No!

00:25.822 --> 00:26.919
No!

00:36.382 --> 00:38.456
No! No, Pop!

00:39.691 --> 00:40.956
I'm sorry.

00:41.056 --> 00:43.589
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

00:54.822 --> 00:57.556
I have more... coins.

00:58.072 --> 00:59.789
Let me see the coins.

01:01.081 --> 01:04.480
Hey, can you break whatever...
Whatever this curse is?

01:04.580 --> 01:06.369
I have victims in my
holding cells right now.

01:06.416 --> 01:08.080
They are banging their heads
against the wall, and I...

01:08.180 --> 01:09.599
Okay, okay. Listen...

01:09.694 --> 01:12.447
Bea is the only victim I'm
concerned with at this time.

01:12.952 --> 01:15.887
Once the hex is broken,
everyone will be okay.

01:15.912 --> 01:18.147
Where the hell are Calvin and Isaac?

01:36.013 --> 01:37.313
May, come on.

01:40.680 --> 01:42.247
Put your hands over mine.

01:42.861 --> 01:43.894
Do it.

01:46.813 --> 01:48.980
Okay, just focus in.

01:52.065 --> 01:54.204
- Okay, focus in.
- Right.

01:55.390 --> 01:57.118
Oh, thank goodness.

01:57.819 --> 01:59.752
Do you have the rest of the coins?

02:02.047 --> 02:04.880
- How is she?
- She's been kind of as...

02:06.913 --> 02:08.646
Where' Isaac?

02:15.034 --> 02:15.965
No.

02:15.990 --> 02:18.631
Look. Okay, okay, listen, Calvin.

02:18.916 --> 02:20.846
Calvin, I'm gonna need you
to go clean yourself up

02:20.917 --> 02:23.621
and go help Garvey ward the grounds.

02:23.700 --> 02:25.847
- As the sun rises...
- Calvin...

02:25.947 --> 02:27.147
Ma...

02:28.513 --> 02:29.813
I'm sorry.

02:30.581 --> 02:33.526
We need your help with protecting
this place right now, okay?

02:33.812 --> 02:35.907
- Please.
- He was my father.

02:36.145 --> 02:38.347
- Calvin. Calvin!
- He was my father.

02:38.447 --> 02:40.724
Tilly needs us to do this right now.

02:41.068 --> 02:43.201
It's what Isaac would do.

02:45.027 --> 02:47.213
Please.

03:03.180 --> 03:06.080
Tilly, I'm so sorry about Isaac.

03:11.180 --> 03:15.613
Okay, well... Um, we need
to focus on Bea right now, okay, so...

03:16.311 --> 03:18.778
Just... just focus on Bea.

03:18.878 --> 03:20.247
But what can you do for her?

03:20.334 --> 03:22.878
I only know the cure she's taught me.

03:24.823 --> 03:25.878
Cupping.

03:25.879 --> 03:28.115
- Cupping, yeah. Cupping. Cupping.
- What's cupping?

03:28.140 --> 03:30.117
I'll be in the alchemy
room, I'll be right back.

03:30.211 --> 03:31.311
What do you need me do? Can I...

03:31.411 --> 03:33.611
Uh, just take her blouse off.

03:39.845 --> 03:41.745
I'm sorry, Bea.

03:54.811 --> 03:55.978
Is she gonna die?

03:57.011 --> 03:58.878
Not my mother.

03:58.978 --> 04:02.278
I've known drill instructors who
weren't half as tough as she is.

04:04.811 --> 04:08.411
When I was a kid, part of my Sunday
chores were resetting the wards.

04:08.511 --> 04:11.178
Demon rat traps, Pops called 'em.

04:11.278 --> 04:13.366
It's supposed to keep evil away.

04:14.578 --> 04:16.596
Didn't think I'd take 'em literally.

04:17.445 --> 04:20.511
I wanna help, but they
always stick me so far away.

04:20.611 --> 04:22.448
At the kids' table?

04:22.543 --> 04:23.678
With me?

04:26.911 --> 04:29.310
I know you weren't planning on
meeting you father this way,

04:29.335 --> 04:31.262
but sometimes life...

04:31.373 --> 04:34.635
My father woud've stayed
around to raise me.

04:35.134 --> 04:36.834
You're just a sperm donor.

04:59.945 --> 05:02.545
Maybe it's best for
everyone if I just leave.

05:04.978 --> 05:06.778
Is that what you want?

05:09.378 --> 05:12.045
I just want things to be the way
they used to be.

05:12.145 --> 05:14.011
Goofy and weird.

05:18.045 --> 05:19.678
Think I'd like that, too.

05:22.285 --> 05:24.697
Here. Take your time.

05:26.101 --> 05:27.872
Yeah.

05:28.411 --> 05:30.217
Good.

05:35.111 --> 05:36.378
Uh-uh.

05:39.213 --> 05:40.579
Tilly...

05:42.305 --> 05:44.608
I'm cupping her Manipura Chakra.

05:44.811 --> 05:47.245
Are you sure this is gonna work?

05:47.945 --> 05:49.778
Really hope so.

05:53.178 --> 05:55.125
Now I'm going to cup her...

05:57.188 --> 05:58.958
Anahata Chakra.

06:02.011 --> 06:04.111
I have to whisper this just right.

06:12.642 --> 06:14.936
It's working.

06:18.890 --> 06:20.206
Tilly, what's happening?

06:20.231 --> 06:22.389
Tilly, Tilly, what's happening?
Do something!

06:22.414 --> 06:24.222
She has to fight to live now!

06:24.247 --> 06:26.319
She has to fight?

06:26.525 --> 06:29.311
Do something! You want me to
call somebody, do something?

06:55.011 --> 06:57.728
- Just tell me.
- She can tell you herself.

06:59.454 --> 07:01.820
Hey. Hey, sweetie.

07:02.245 --> 07:03.445
Hey.

07:04.139 --> 07:05.639
What'd I say?

07:05.867 --> 07:07.260
Calvin said you were
as tough as a Marine.

07:07.324 --> 07:10.398
You got that right.

07:10.628 --> 07:12.454
I... I could really use a cup of tea.

07:12.534 --> 07:14.271
Yeah. Yeah, I got it.

07:16.949 --> 07:18.316
Hi.

07:21.626 --> 07:23.626
Let's not go doing that
too many times, okay?

07:23.726 --> 07:26.873
You sound like Isaac.

07:27.031 --> 07:28.192
Where is he?

07:30.928 --> 07:32.326
Uh, Ma, you should get some rest.

07:32.426 --> 07:35.259
I have the rest of my life to rest.
Where is Isaac?

07:35.359 --> 07:37.387
Bea, why don't you sit down?

07:37.534 --> 07:38.901
I want you to go home now.

07:39.359 --> 07:41.426
- What happened?
- Now.

07:41.526 --> 07:43.192
- Where is he?
- Okay.

07:43.244 --> 07:44.243
Where is he?

07:44.268 --> 07:45.507
Now, I hate to be the one to tell you...

07:45.532 --> 07:46.682
- No, where is he? Where's my husband?
- Mom.

07:46.707 --> 07:48.170
- It's bad...
- I heard you.

07:48.195 --> 07:49.395
Where is his body?

07:51.859 --> 07:54.726
This isn't a good
idea for you to see. No!

07:54.810 --> 07:56.576
Leave me alone!

07:58.892 --> 08:00.226
And don't come in.

08:08.526 --> 08:10.369
Oh, God.

08:18.359 --> 08:19.810
It's gonna be okay.

08:45.892 --> 08:47.259
Come back to me, Isaac.

09:05.043 --> 09:06.910
Did I miss anything?

09:22.126 --> 09:24.792
- He's finally sleeping.
- Sleeping?

09:24.892 --> 09:26.560
- My pop was dead.
- That was a close call.

09:26.585 --> 09:28.862
Close call? Bea, he was decapitated.

09:28.894 --> 09:30.410
The alchemy room had a cure.

09:30.526 --> 09:32.386
A cure?

09:32.624 --> 09:33.989
I know I'm on the outside

09:34.014 --> 09:35.466
of most of what goes on around here

09:35.717 --> 09:38.577
but since when can anything in that
room bring somebody back to life?

09:38.892 --> 09:40.126
Since never.

09:40.226 --> 09:42.792
- Okay.
- Ma, he was dead.

09:42.892 --> 09:44.600
I was there. I put his body in a bag,

09:44.783 --> 09:47.392
put in on the prep table. After four
tours, I know what dead looks like.

09:47.492 --> 09:48.504
Enough.

09:48.529 --> 09:50.315
Isaac needs his rest. You guys, get.

09:50.340 --> 09:51.388
He's not sleeping.

09:51.413 --> 09:53.026
- Ma...
- Get... Go.

09:54.899 --> 09:56.133
Go.

10:30.559 --> 10:32.959
He's talking about
having a splitting headache.

10:33.169 --> 10:35.518
So that tells me he's on the mend.

10:37.146 --> 10:39.079
"On the mend" is an understatement.

10:43.159 --> 10:46.077
He told me what happened.

10:46.659 --> 10:49.204
That the thing overpowered
you both and beheaded him.

10:50.626 --> 10:51.892
He told you that?

10:53.292 --> 10:55.026
He felt I should know.

11:00.426 --> 11:02.492
There's some things
you're not telling me.

11:03.635 --> 11:05.192
So much more.

11:08.080 --> 11:10.826
You know, with any family...

11:10.926 --> 11:12.459
With this family especially...

11:14.792 --> 11:17.755
better to not know some
things to keep you safe.

11:18.692 --> 11:22.426
- To keep things as close to normal...
- You know I want answers.

11:24.426 --> 11:27.505
Then let them come from him.

11:28.159 --> 11:29.592
In his own time.

11:31.559 --> 11:32.892
In the meantime...

11:33.659 --> 11:34.659
meet with Tilly.

11:34.759 --> 11:37.292
She'll walk you through
some of our defenses.

11:43.292 --> 11:45.492
I thought I lost you both today.

11:47.795 --> 11:48.828
No.

11:51.626 --> 11:54.026
No, you'll never lose us, son.

11:56.679 --> 11:58.612
You'll never gonna lose us.

12:06.095 --> 12:08.207
Come on, baby, let's talk about it.

12:08.232 --> 12:10.644
No. And I don't wanna smoke
about it, either.

12:10.771 --> 12:12.626
You do not understand.

12:12.726 --> 12:16.131
I'm offering you an ear and comfort.
Come on... Please.

12:16.226 --> 12:18.926
This is your sanctuary.
It's a place just for you.

12:20.126 --> 12:21.667
What up, Charles?

12:25.726 --> 12:27.626
All right. Okay.

12:27.726 --> 12:29.026
Uh, let's see.

12:29.126 --> 12:32.352
Well, my grandma was very, very sick.

12:32.439 --> 12:35.259
She's better now, but my grandpa...

12:35.359 --> 12:36.892
Oh, my God.

12:36.975 --> 12:39.085
My grandpa was...

12:39.267 --> 12:41.267
Now he's...

12:41.746 --> 12:43.446
I get it, baby.

12:43.626 --> 12:47.792
And my so-called father just
wants to so-called bond with me.

12:47.892 --> 12:50.059
Which at this point could
only end in a murder-suicide.

12:50.120 --> 12:51.906
I know, baby. I know.

12:54.826 --> 12:57.005
What? I'm offering you comfort.

12:57.061 --> 12:58.886
Yeah, well, your comfort's
making me uncomfortable.

12:58.982 --> 13:00.990
Okay. We said we'd wait.

13:01.053 --> 13:02.326
I'm down with that, baby.

13:02.426 --> 13:05.759
Just... You know I love
your dirty drawers.

13:05.859 --> 13:08.426
You know I hate that expression.
My drawers aren't dirty.

13:08.730 --> 13:10.857
What I'm trying to say is...

13:11.063 --> 13:12.682
if you like waiting, I like waiting.

13:12.754 --> 13:14.753
Like if, uh, you wanna
smoke some cigarettes,

13:14.778 --> 13:16.389
I'd smoke 'em too. I mean...

13:16.452 --> 13:19.126
it's silly for both of us to
die of cancer, and, uh...

13:19.151 --> 13:20.234
e-cigarettes aren't even better.

13:20.257 --> 13:22.257
They have a lot of metal in them,
and I just...

13:22.392 --> 13:24.184
I gotta go.

13:24.209 --> 13:27.939
No! Hold on. Hold on. I can
make all this up to you.

13:27.964 --> 13:29.626
Uh...

13:29.726 --> 13:33.766
I got this lavender skin
therapy massage oil off eBay.

13:34.092 --> 13:36.215
- Want a massage?
- Lavender, huh?

13:36.259 --> 13:37.859
Mmm-hmm.

13:40.959 --> 13:42.659
Okay.

13:42.759 --> 13:45.745
Okay, but first I have
a mission for you.

13:45.959 --> 13:47.492
Yeah, anything.

13:47.592 --> 13:52.192
Can you do a deep dive on the dark
web for anything on Calvin Hastings?

13:52.292 --> 13:54.953
Marines. Enlisted 16 years ago.

13:57.459 --> 13:59.334
Yeah. You got it.

14:00.126 --> 14:02.326
Now, focus back to me.

14:02.426 --> 14:03.792
Let's deep dive into here,

14:03.892 --> 14:06.167
I can get those sore muscles out...

14:07.659 --> 14:09.426
Work first, play later.

14:16.028 --> 14:17.359
And I'm supposed to just act like

14:17.400 --> 14:19.650
he just came down with a case of the flu.

14:21.092 --> 14:22.571
I don't know if I can get
my head around that.

14:23.159 --> 14:24.793
Uh, poor choice of words.

14:24.968 --> 14:26.261
Well, you're gonna have to.

14:26.285 --> 14:27.744
In the meantime,
we do have a lot of things to do.

14:27.745 --> 14:31.250
A lot of the instruments have
been upgraded since you were 18.

14:31.359 --> 14:35.426
Amulets, swords, crystals, potions.
Those things never change.

14:35.526 --> 14:37.088
Well, see, Isaac has traveled the world

14:37.183 --> 14:40.726
in search of the most rare and
powerful weapons. Like... Oh.

14:45.026 --> 14:47.427
Check it out. Oh!

14:47.559 --> 14:50.759
It's heavy. Looks ancient.

14:50.859 --> 14:52.713
Yeah. Deadly.

14:53.888 --> 14:55.103
Not bad.

14:55.190 --> 14:57.592
Let me introduce you
to a friend of mine.

14:58.826 --> 15:00.188
This is a KA-BAR.

15:00.888 --> 15:02.221
Next to an M16,

15:02.302 --> 15:04.455
this has been every Marine's
best friend since World War II.

15:05.099 --> 15:07.465
Hmm. It's heavy.

15:07.564 --> 15:09.431
Wouldn't an M16 be faster?

15:09.659 --> 15:10.792
Guns are noisy.

15:10.892 --> 15:13.792
This is for those close encounters
where silence is golden.

15:13.892 --> 15:16.091
Mmm-hmm. Well...

15:16.170 --> 15:18.926
we'll see how useful they are
against chupacabras, jinns,

15:19.026 --> 15:21.559
- infernals...
- Doppelgangers, Girgashites.

15:21.659 --> 15:24.302
I've not forgotten everything
about the family business.

15:24.635 --> 15:28.259
Hey, do you have any mystical way
you could weaponize this quickly?

15:29.262 --> 15:32.062
Isaac's taught me a thing or two.

15:32.226 --> 15:34.459
Yeah, I'll get it back to you.
But first...

15:34.559 --> 15:36.797
you ever shot one of these bad boys?

15:39.551 --> 15:41.659
Maybe I'll just leave you
in here by yourself.

16:16.927 --> 16:18.371
Everything back to normal now?

16:18.395 --> 16:20.015
What is normal in La Rochelle?

16:20.070 --> 16:21.855
You know there's always been
a bit of crazy in the town.

16:21.880 --> 16:24.533
- It just makes it quirky.
- Yeah.

16:24.776 --> 16:27.009
- How's Isaac?
- Still alive.

16:27.172 --> 16:29.406
Still can't believe it, Chief.

16:29.530 --> 16:31.030
Welcome back.

16:31.226 --> 16:33.724
Hey. He's with me.

16:34.059 --> 16:36.692
You know, Pop and I got a pretty
good strike at what attacked us.

16:36.744 --> 16:38.644
Seen any new faces around town?

16:38.792 --> 16:40.226
Not many. Who?

16:40.326 --> 16:42.515
Creepy looking white guy. Cowboy hat.

16:42.650 --> 16:45.721
Kinda look like Johnny Cash
and Undertaker made a baby.

16:46.426 --> 16:49.567
You're gonna have to
give me more than that to go on.

16:49.926 --> 16:51.924
Maybe I can sit down with
one of your sketch artists.

16:51.988 --> 16:55.659
Who or whatever he is should
be on your watchlist.

16:55.759 --> 16:57.685
I'll make that happen.

16:58.092 --> 17:00.392
Um...

17:01.271 --> 17:03.571
Listen. About Garvey...

17:03.759 --> 17:06.520
- What'd she do now?
- Nothing.

17:06.963 --> 17:08.567
She's got a tough shell.

17:10.159 --> 17:11.858
I don't know how to talk to her.

17:14.291 --> 17:16.789
Calvin, you're still a stranger to her.

17:17.526 --> 17:20.526
Maybe try not talking
at all, just listen.

17:22.592 --> 17:24.159
Give it time.

17:27.992 --> 17:30.426
All right, well, first I hit
Google and there's nothing interesting.

17:30.526 --> 17:32.326
You know, basic high
school photos and junk,

17:32.351 --> 17:35.139
but then, my boy got me
access to the dark web.

17:35.242 --> 17:39.059
Staff Sergeant Calvin Earl Hastings
served four tours overseas.

17:39.159 --> 17:40.892
Iraq and Afghanistan.

17:40.992 --> 17:43.492
How he's not a PTSD
basket case is a miracle.

17:43.592 --> 17:44.992
Yeah, and that door is not closed.

17:45.304 --> 17:47.910
Well, most of his records are
classified, but check it.

17:47.957 --> 17:50.892
Calvin was at the bloodiest
battles of both wars.

17:50.992 --> 17:52.949
- And got the bronze star.
- Yeah.

17:53.052 --> 17:54.559
That's three years ago.
Where's the rest?

17:54.584 --> 17:55.926
That's it.

17:55.951 --> 17:58.341
The trail goes dead. It's like
he disappeared off Earth.

17:59.259 --> 18:00.626
How's that possible?

18:00.726 --> 18:02.492
Did he quit? Was he booted out?

18:02.592 --> 18:04.746
If so, there'd be records.

18:05.180 --> 18:07.180
Yeah, so now you're just back here.

18:07.392 --> 18:08.959
Why?

18:09.439 --> 18:12.117
- Can you email me this?
- Sure.

18:12.226 --> 18:13.591
This is good. Keep digging.

18:13.689 --> 18:15.734
You know you're my hero.

18:30.662 --> 18:32.095
<i>Mi reina.</i>

18:33.470 --> 18:36.937
You... should be resting.

18:37.126 --> 18:39.149
With that thing still out there?

18:39.535 --> 18:41.602
I need to find out what it is.

18:46.026 --> 18:48.157
Look, I know it hurts more each time.

18:49.559 --> 18:52.693
You'd think after dying
hundreds of times...

18:52.986 --> 18:54.311
feeling the blade

18:54.414 --> 18:58.225
touch your vocal cords,
sever your spinal column...

18:59.759 --> 19:04.344
I felt like my entire system
was shutting down. Forever.

19:04.792 --> 19:07.884
And you're going to remember
every second of it

19:08.294 --> 19:10.394
if we don't use the memory crystals.

19:11.400 --> 19:12.967
In time, baby.

19:14.617 --> 19:16.371
Honey.

19:16.474 --> 19:19.992
You have to rest to fully heal.

19:20.092 --> 19:21.326
Hmm? Come on.

19:23.592 --> 19:26.162
Calvin can fight the fight.

19:26.795 --> 19:28.362
Calvin is a kid.

19:28.874 --> 19:30.963
He's got his own things to work through.

19:31.959 --> 19:33.426
Okay.

19:33.470 --> 19:37.255
Our kid is a Marine vet.

19:37.726 --> 19:39.541
And we all have our own
things to work through

19:39.565 --> 19:40.683
or we wouldn't be incarnate.

19:40.723 --> 19:42.708
Isn't that what you always told me?

19:44.259 --> 19:47.426
This infernal is a bigger evil
than we've ever faced, Bea.

19:47.451 --> 19:48.401
Mmm.

19:48.426 --> 19:50.891
I don't know how to banish it.

19:51.272 --> 19:52.994
- I don't even know if I can.
- Mmm.

19:54.826 --> 19:56.459
Look, it won't be just you.

19:58.359 --> 20:02.492
You've got a family
of warriors behind you.

20:04.826 --> 20:06.923
- Family?
- Mmm-hmm.

20:07.992 --> 20:09.659
Come here, family.

20:13.592 --> 20:16.737
Usually when I come back from death,

20:19.459 --> 20:21.348
I'm freezing

20:21.759 --> 20:23.578
and I'm alone.

20:23.898 --> 20:25.064
Like a newborn.

20:25.244 --> 20:26.644
In a way.

20:26.792 --> 20:31.717
And for a moment I don't
know even who I am or where I am.

20:31.959 --> 20:33.725
It's like this flash of confusion.

20:35.492 --> 20:39.025
But this time, Bea,
I opened my eyes and...

20:39.326 --> 20:40.826
You were the first thing I saw.

20:41.726 --> 20:43.724
And I was warm.

20:43.999 --> 20:46.319
You healed me.

20:46.526 --> 20:49.926
Like, like the Goddess Isis, you...

20:50.026 --> 20:51.645
You just put me back together.

20:51.700 --> 20:54.426
- It would've happened without me.
- Not as fast.

20:54.526 --> 20:56.092
You ease my pain.

20:58.826 --> 21:00.862
You save me every day.

21:03.292 --> 21:05.894
You know every little thing about me.

21:06.461 --> 21:08.503
And all the crazy shit
that comes with that...

21:08.528 --> 21:10.195
- I do.
- Woman, and...

21:10.826 --> 21:13.459
- Still you stay.
- Mmm.

21:15.826 --> 21:18.094
Because immortal men are so hot.

21:20.559 --> 21:21.759
Mmm.

21:24.417 --> 21:26.592
Okay, okay.

21:26.638 --> 21:29.408
- Come here. Come here.
- What are you doing?

21:29.510 --> 21:30.643
Come here.

21:32.959 --> 21:34.459
Mmm.

21:35.026 --> 21:36.326
Mmm.

21:38.659 --> 21:40.559
Yup. Here?

21:42.292 --> 21:43.826
Can you even handle this now?

21:44.134 --> 21:46.697
Trust me, I'm good.

21:46.988 --> 21:48.755
He didn't cut off everything.

21:56.094 --> 21:57.276
Hello.

21:58.352 --> 21:59.652
You thirsty?

21:59.792 --> 22:02.926
Can I give one of my,
uh, famous mint juleps?

22:03.026 --> 22:04.859
Uh, yeah, sure, that'd be great.

22:10.159 --> 22:12.833
- What?
- Nothing.

22:13.392 --> 22:16.426
Nothing? It's never nothing. What?

22:16.526 --> 22:19.174
It's just the middle of the day.
You've got bed head.

22:20.892 --> 22:23.226
Old house, thin walls. Just saying.

22:24.030 --> 22:25.617
Calvin...

22:28.926 --> 22:30.792
I'm just glad you two
are feeling better.

22:30.892 --> 22:33.294
Good as new. Thank you.

22:33.792 --> 22:35.683
You know, your father...

22:36.059 --> 22:39.334
Is literally indestructible.

22:40.126 --> 22:42.659
- Yeah. So I heard.
- Okay.

22:44.259 --> 22:47.359
So, you can calm down now
about that whole

22:47.459 --> 22:49.730
seeing your father's death foolishness.

22:51.292 --> 22:54.159
Uh, yeah, I wish I could.

22:54.792 --> 22:57.246
But what I saw had nothing
to do with the beheading.

22:57.926 --> 22:59.259
We were at his funeral.

23:00.242 --> 23:02.266
That was a bad dream.

23:02.692 --> 23:05.361
- Or anxiety.
- Well, that was before I came home.

23:06.396 --> 23:08.230
And if that's the case,

23:08.426 --> 23:11.192
why would I see Tilly?
And I've never met her before.

23:11.276 --> 23:13.827
We were all the same age
we are right now.

23:14.184 --> 23:18.192
Whatever's out there, Mom,
it knows Dad's weak spot.

23:18.292 --> 23:20.092
It's not gonna stop until he's dead.

23:21.492 --> 23:22.692
For real.

23:36.526 --> 23:37.759
Young man.

23:40.426 --> 23:43.892
Hey. So sorry. I know the
field's closed after dark.

23:43.992 --> 23:45.556
I just wanted to...

23:45.731 --> 23:47.392
Your heart. It's racing.

23:47.556 --> 23:51.556
Trying to get my heart rate down
to like, 40 beats a minute.

23:51.792 --> 23:52.992
It's defective.

23:54.326 --> 23:55.659
Atrial septum.

23:56.598 --> 23:59.759
ASD. Since I was a baby.

24:01.392 --> 24:02.659
How did you know?

24:03.759 --> 24:05.051
I can help.

24:06.524 --> 24:08.824
You're like a doctor or something?

24:08.877 --> 24:11.892
If you will allow me to take your pulse.

24:22.526 --> 24:24.826
- Perfect.
- Oh! Oh, God.

24:26.074 --> 24:27.359
What's wrong with me?

24:27.459 --> 24:30.026
I need your strength, I need your eyes.

24:33.126 --> 24:35.326
You will find this for me.

24:45.592 --> 24:47.026
Perfect.

24:56.817 --> 24:58.624
All right.

24:59.592 --> 25:02.512
Wheel it closer to the corner.

25:05.206 --> 25:08.143
On the waiting list, already
got four bodies in the morgue.

25:08.245 --> 25:10.533
- Say he's a heart attack.
- Oh, thank goodness.

25:10.587 --> 25:12.026
- What? Why?
- Oh.

25:13.959 --> 25:15.199
Easy prep.

25:15.338 --> 25:19.372
See, young guys these days, they die
from suicides, gunshots, car crashes...

25:19.726 --> 25:22.059
Falling off cliffs while taking selfies.

25:22.159 --> 25:24.926
So prepping him is like a day off work.

25:25.626 --> 25:26.692
But first...

25:29.859 --> 25:31.759
Yup. Just a normal dead body.

25:32.426 --> 25:33.659
How old was he?

25:33.759 --> 25:36.459
Twenty-eight. Ancient, huh?

25:36.559 --> 25:37.792
No, I just...

25:37.892 --> 25:39.992
I don't know. Sometimes
I wonder when it will be my time.

25:40.092 --> 25:41.752
Oh, girl, please.

25:42.592 --> 25:44.092
Hey.

25:44.192 --> 25:46.867
You have so much life left in you.

25:47.937 --> 25:49.487
Yeah.

25:49.826 --> 25:52.448
Okay, well, I have another pickup.

25:54.528 --> 25:58.496
He had this condition when he was tiny.

25:58.821 --> 26:00.283
His heart...

26:00.359 --> 26:02.892
But all his doctors said
that he'd beaten it.

26:02.992 --> 26:04.392
Miracle boy.

26:04.488 --> 26:07.409
He ran track in high school
and he wrestled in college.

26:08.059 --> 26:09.353
Total sports nut.

26:09.378 --> 26:11.616
Artist and sports nut.

26:11.766 --> 26:13.607
That's why he looked up to Arlo.

26:16.444 --> 26:18.729
We're so sorry.

26:19.026 --> 26:22.192
No, that's, that's...
It's all right. It's...

26:23.392 --> 26:26.773
It's been 16 years, but...

26:27.792 --> 26:32.259
still not a day goes by when he's
not in my thoughts and, uh...

26:32.859 --> 26:34.209
in my heart.

26:37.126 --> 26:38.910
Nothing can hurt us after this.

26:38.990 --> 26:40.859
We've suffered the worst pain.

26:42.159 --> 26:43.792
But this we know.

26:43.926 --> 26:48.053
We would rather have had
Francisco for 28 years...

26:49.339 --> 26:53.459
...and all of the heartache that
comes with losing him than to...

26:54.526 --> 26:56.792
never had had him at all.

28:25.459 --> 28:27.767
These ladies are kicking our ass, son.

28:28.692 --> 28:31.021
- Beginner's luck.
- Hmm.

28:31.426 --> 28:33.164
How many spades you got
under that dress, Mama?

28:33.306 --> 28:36.037
Okay. Just quiet down. Mmm?

28:36.392 --> 28:38.792
It's the last game before I have you
all come help me set the table.

28:38.892 --> 28:41.626
I bid three tricks.

28:42.762 --> 28:43.959
Calvin, your bid.

28:44.859 --> 28:46.926
- One.
- One?

28:47.026 --> 28:48.792
But what kinda boy did I raise?

28:50.818 --> 28:52.092
Four.

28:53.692 --> 28:54.726
Five.

28:54.826 --> 28:55.724
Hmm.

28:55.811 --> 28:58.292
Apparently, I am playing for two.

29:02.605 --> 29:03.838
Calvin.

29:12.026 --> 29:13.626
What's wrong now, son?

29:14.822 --> 29:16.750
What's wrong?

29:17.192 --> 29:19.648
Three days ago, you were dead.

29:20.226 --> 29:22.645
And I don't mean some
David Blaine magic-dead.

29:22.726 --> 29:24.169
I mean, you were decapitated.

29:24.194 --> 29:25.221
And now we're just sitting around here

29:25.246 --> 29:26.217
playing cards like nothing happened.

29:26.242 --> 29:28.376
- Yeah, I'm gonna see about dinner.
- No, Mom.

29:28.511 --> 29:29.880
What's going on around here?

29:30.792 --> 29:34.162
Pop, who are you?

29:34.292 --> 29:35.932
What are you?

29:36.859 --> 29:40.059
- Now is not the time, son.
- Yeah, well, past the time.

29:40.159 --> 29:41.459
You can't die, can you?

29:42.482 --> 29:44.148
So what does that make us?

29:44.392 --> 29:47.392
Are we expendable? Are we...
Are we cannon fodder?

29:48.574 --> 29:49.859
Pop, what are you?

29:51.426 --> 29:52.526
What was that?

29:52.645 --> 29:56.159
Oh, it's probably that
crazy cat in my lab again.

30:01.559 --> 30:03.292
I'm gonna go check on that.

30:13.459 --> 30:15.435
There was once a group of warriors.

30:16.992 --> 30:19.467
Known as the Warriors of Saladin.

30:20.459 --> 30:22.892
And they were tasked with
protecting the Holy Land.

30:22.992 --> 30:25.659
And our great, great,
great, great grandfather,

30:25.759 --> 30:26.859
Rezan the Moor,

30:26.959 --> 30:29.236
was a knight who helped save

30:29.300 --> 30:31.169
hundreds of people during the crusades.

30:31.170 --> 30:32.207
Pop, I know this story.

30:32.232 --> 30:33.899
You told it to me almost
every night before bed.

30:33.926 --> 30:36.292
It's more than a bedtime story, son.

30:36.392 --> 30:38.862
It's our personal history.

30:38.973 --> 30:40.259
And I should know.

30:40.980 --> 30:42.413
I am Rizan.

30:43.326 --> 30:45.026
I am that Moor.

30:45.126 --> 30:46.526
I am that warrior.

30:47.459 --> 30:49.731
I am that knight.

30:54.792 --> 30:56.810
Doesn't make any sense.

30:57.040 --> 30:58.259
You would have to be...

30:58.359 --> 31:00.986
778 years old,

31:01.335 --> 31:02.701
to be exact.

31:29.559 --> 31:30.926
No! No!

31:36.235 --> 31:37.859
Oh, my God. Tilly.

31:48.592 --> 31:50.660
Tilly? Tilly.

32:14.263 --> 32:15.397
Her hand!

32:18.995 --> 32:20.655
Her hand!

32:21.259 --> 32:22.910
I need a weapon.

32:43.911 --> 32:45.359
What are they?

32:45.459 --> 32:46.554
I don't know.

32:46.602 --> 32:48.026
These runes must have been
the source of their power.

32:48.051 --> 32:49.607
'Cause cutting his
hand off killed this one.

32:49.659 --> 32:51.004
Then we should call the cops.

32:51.059 --> 32:52.924
Yeah, you wanna explain that 911 call?

32:52.988 --> 32:54.336
We've been invaded.

32:54.392 --> 32:56.646
What are they looking for?
What do they want?

32:59.183 --> 33:00.934
Yeah, come here now.

33:00.959 --> 33:03.646
Okay, everybody grab
something they can kill with.

33:03.670 --> 33:06.425
- Okay...
- Son, listen.

33:06.526 --> 33:07.859
We know this house better than anyone.

33:07.959 --> 33:10.868
Calvin, you take the main floor.
Mom and I will be on the top.

33:10.928 --> 33:12.987
- Tilly, you stay here.
- Uh-uh.

33:40.841 --> 33:43.737
Keep your eye on the ball.

33:51.859 --> 33:53.547
What'd you think it is?

33:54.596 --> 33:55.880
Reanimation?

33:57.175 --> 33:58.675
Demonic possession?

33:58.928 --> 34:01.992
Never seen a reanimated corpse before.

34:03.192 --> 34:04.526
Until you, that is.

34:05.459 --> 34:06.959
Stay focused, son.

34:07.156 --> 34:11.085
Madagascar Cortez,
you're not going anywhere.

34:11.292 --> 34:12.492
<i>I know you.</i>

34:12.592 --> 34:15.204
<i>I made you a headless wanderer.</i>

34:16.168 --> 34:17.368
Who are you?

34:17.492 --> 34:20.259
<i>I've gone by many names.</i>

34:20.359 --> 34:23.429
<i>The Romans called me the Inferne.</i>

34:23.792 --> 34:26.513
<i>The Chinese called me Shang Wen.</i>

34:27.059 --> 34:29.291
<i>I have become death,</i>

34:29.525 --> 34:32.083
<i>the destroyer of worlds.</i>

34:32.259 --> 34:35.409
<i>I am the walrus. Coo coo ca-choo.</i>

34:35.592 --> 34:36.726
What do we call you?

34:37.123 --> 34:40.492
<i>The name the Ching Maru
tribe bestowed upon me,</i>

34:40.592 --> 34:43.159
<i>as I vanquished them
nearly to extinction.</i>

34:43.936 --> 34:45.192
<i>The Dredge.</i>

34:46.222 --> 34:49.203
<i>What... What do I call you?</i>

34:49.359 --> 34:52.303
<i>I've never met one of your kind.</i>

34:52.359 --> 34:54.136
<i>I've heard rumors of you mortals,</i>

34:54.208 --> 34:57.993
<i>but none looking quite like you.</i>

35:00.186 --> 35:01.945
<i>Headless one,</i>

35:02.152 --> 35:03.898
<i>you have the ring of Solomon.</i>

35:05.126 --> 35:07.992
<i>Are you all immortal?</i>

35:10.259 --> 35:11.841
<i>That's what I thought.</i>

35:13.324 --> 35:15.056
Oh, God. No!

35:15.358 --> 35:16.604
No!

35:28.177 --> 35:29.843
Stay dead this time.

35:37.192 --> 35:38.792
- See our boy tonight?
- Mm.

35:38.892 --> 35:41.041
- Huh?
- Mm-hmm.

35:41.426 --> 35:43.559
- He did good, didn't he?
- Mm-hmm.

35:44.792 --> 35:47.726
What about you? You okay?

35:47.826 --> 35:51.759
Hey, I am the kind of brother
that's built to last.

35:57.759 --> 35:59.059
Let me see.

35:59.159 --> 36:00.759
Bea, I'm good.

36:00.859 --> 36:02.030
I'm good, sweetie.

36:02.592 --> 36:03.892
Good.

36:03.992 --> 36:05.259
But not a good liar.

36:06.426 --> 36:07.559
Open your shirt.

36:08.514 --> 36:09.626
Come on.

36:17.792 --> 36:19.774
Dear God!

36:20.492 --> 36:23.059
- It looks worse than it is.
- It looks pretty bad.

36:23.134 --> 36:26.082
- What is it? How do you feel?
- I don't know.

36:26.661 --> 36:29.192
I haven't felt like this since
before I became immortal.

36:31.482 --> 36:34.682
Just think a lifetime of
battles is catching up on me.

36:35.726 --> 36:38.759
I've seen it once before
on another one like me.

36:40.726 --> 36:42.653
It spread pretty fast.

36:44.359 --> 36:46.526
Well then, you need
to go and take care of it.

36:48.092 --> 36:49.526
I can't do that here, Bea.

36:49.626 --> 36:52.226
And I can't leave
the family in jeopardy.

36:55.292 --> 36:56.859
Do you hear yourself?

36:58.626 --> 37:01.092
Honey, you're immortal. Not invincible.

37:02.992 --> 37:04.666
Come here.

37:04.892 --> 37:07.026
Oh, gosh.

37:10.059 --> 37:12.722
You said the, um... The dredge would...

37:13.892 --> 37:15.357
need some time to lick its wounds.

37:15.460 --> 37:18.126
How much... How much time do you have?

37:19.792 --> 37:21.326
Days, hours, I don't know.

37:23.526 --> 37:25.683
I know someone who can help.

37:26.620 --> 37:29.754
And he can help me find a
weapon to defeat this Dredge.

37:33.292 --> 37:35.259
Okay, I'm not asking you.

37:35.892 --> 37:37.059
I'm telling you.

37:37.552 --> 37:38.592
Go.

37:41.226 --> 37:44.496
We have raised a decorated Marine.

37:45.026 --> 37:47.626
You just saw him fight. We will be okay.

37:49.059 --> 37:50.226
Go.

37:58.892 --> 38:02.126
The upside is, this thing is after me.

38:03.892 --> 38:05.259
So,

38:06.326 --> 38:07.826
Bea, If I...

38:07.926 --> 38:10.889
If I left tonight, it would follow me.

38:11.526 --> 38:13.192
And you'd be safe for a while.

38:15.392 --> 38:17.859
That's not exactly an upside.

39:15.501 --> 39:16.859
Where are you headed?

39:19.059 --> 39:20.492
Can't tell you.

39:21.126 --> 39:22.459
Yeah.

39:22.559 --> 39:25.192
If you don't know. Nothing
can force it out of you.

39:31.326 --> 39:34.081
Looks like you're gonna be
the man of the house, son.

39:34.526 --> 39:36.326
You don't mind sticking around a while?

39:40.152 --> 39:41.492
Wanna think about it?

39:43.359 --> 39:45.090
It's all I've been thinking about.

39:46.026 --> 39:48.233
Everything that's gone down since I...

39:48.796 --> 39:51.559
Only got 30 days leave.
That's not nearly enough.

39:55.492 --> 39:57.294
I'm gonna resign my commission.

39:58.041 --> 39:59.564
I'm leaving the Corps.

40:01.992 --> 40:03.559
Calvin, you sure?

40:07.749 --> 40:09.383
Sixteen years.

40:09.626 --> 40:11.940
My first mission has been
to protect the country,

40:12.017 --> 40:13.670
now I need to protect my family.

40:26.626 --> 40:28.126
I want you to take this.

40:28.226 --> 40:30.112
It's always kept me safe.

40:30.392 --> 40:32.088
You wear it.

40:32.334 --> 40:34.334
And don't ever take it off.

40:36.492 --> 40:39.026
Pop, you've had it since forever.
I can't take this.

40:39.126 --> 40:40.259
You can and you will.

40:40.359 --> 40:42.026
- Pop.
- That's an order.

40:52.826 --> 40:54.459
What do these inscriptions mean?

40:54.590 --> 40:57.050
More than I got time to teach you.

40:58.059 --> 41:01.026
Everything you need to know
is in the alchemy book.

41:01.126 --> 41:02.826
The rest, you'll learn for yourself.

41:08.345 --> 41:09.568
I gotta get.

41:17.192 --> 41:18.826
You come back soon, Pop.

41:19.459 --> 41:20.959
I promise.
