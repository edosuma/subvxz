00:18.844 --> 00:21.021
With just the lipstick,
nothing fancy.

00:21.151 --> 00:22.326
I'm in a bit of a

00:22.457 --> 00:23.936
<i>rush today. Um...</i>

00:24.067 --> 00:26.722
I know I said
that the soul within me,

00:26.852 --> 00:29.203
no man can degrade, but...

00:29.333 --> 00:31.031
I may have been mistaken.

00:31.161 --> 00:32.989
-I like the monkey.

00:34.730 --> 00:37.254
<i>I just finished my second
double shift this week,</i>

00:37.385 --> 00:39.082
<i>and the administrators here</i>

00:39.213 --> 00:42.085
are telling us not to spend too
much time on certain patients.

00:42.216 --> 00:44.609
I've seen people die
that shouldn't have.

01:00.625 --> 01:02.932
This was a

01:03.063 --> 01:05.978
once-in-a-century pandemic.

01:06.109 --> 01:07.893
Once in a century.

01:08.024 --> 01:11.027
The medical workers are being
championed as heroes.

01:11.158 --> 01:12.681
They gave of their time,

01:12.811 --> 01:14.900
-They gave of their lives...
-Do you have a question,

01:15.031 --> 01:16.815
-Mr. Glubman?
-How can you now

01:16.946 --> 01:19.340
sue the same heroes

01:19.470 --> 01:20.689
for the death of one person?

01:20.819 --> 01:24.258
That person was my daughter.

01:25.781 --> 01:29.132
And I am sorry
for your loss, Mr. Rivi,

01:29.263 --> 01:31.178
but Harbor Hospital
is not responsible

01:31.308 --> 01:32.396
for your daughter's death.

01:32.527 --> 01:35.051
Pia's death.

01:35.182 --> 01:37.358
Use her name.

01:37.488 --> 01:39.360
She died in your hospital

01:39.490 --> 01:41.449
with no one to hold her.

01:41.579 --> 01:44.016
To comfort her, kiss her cheek.

01:45.061 --> 01:47.803
She was in perfect health,

01:47.933 --> 01:48.934
and you--

01:49.065 --> 01:50.240
you let her die.

01:50.371 --> 01:51.502
We let nobody die, sir.

01:51.633 --> 01:52.938
Well, then release the records.

01:53.113 --> 01:55.115
It's your hospital.
Why are they being denied to us?

01:55.245 --> 01:58.161
We've already said
HIPAA rules prevent us

01:58.292 --> 01:59.510
from sharing Pia's
medical records

01:59.728 --> 02:03.514
-with unauthorized recipients.
-I am her father.

02:03.645 --> 02:05.908
Unauthorized includes
family members.

02:06.038 --> 02:08.215
Legally, she was an adult
and entitled to medical privacy.

02:08.345 --> 02:10.260
I have a new exhibit
to introduce.

02:10.391 --> 02:13.611
A video created
by a Harbor Hospital employee.

02:14.656 --> 02:16.048
<i>And the crazy thing is</i>

02:16.179 --> 02:19.661
<i>we treat our
VIPs like they're royalty.</i>

02:19.791 --> 02:21.228
<i>But if you're not a VIP?</i>

02:21.358 --> 02:23.621
<i>COVID is a killer,</i>

02:23.752 --> 02:26.929
<i>but if you're Black or brown
at this hospital,</i>

02:27.059 --> 02:28.235
<i>that's worse.</i>

02:28.365 --> 02:29.758
Did Pia Rivi

02:29.888 --> 02:32.326
receive inferior treatment
at Harbor Hospital

02:32.456 --> 02:34.154
because she was Latinx?

02:34.284 --> 02:35.677
Of course not.

02:35.807 --> 02:37.766
That... that is offensive.

02:37.896 --> 02:40.595
And, uh,
we will need time to verify

02:40.725 --> 02:42.814
that this "video" is real.

02:47.210 --> 02:48.951
Well done. <i>Bien hecho.</i>

02:49.081 --> 02:51.214
Ah, <i>muchas gracias.</i>

02:51.345 --> 02:53.303
It comes from having
a good investigator.

02:53.434 --> 02:54.913
<i>Agradecemo.</i>

02:56.828 --> 02:59.222
I want you to meet my wife.
She, uh...

02:59.353 --> 03:02.007
she kept me sane
when I was in prison.

03:02.138 --> 03:03.574
There she is.

03:03.705 --> 03:05.489
Wait, wait, wait. Wait.

03:24.639 --> 03:26.206
Isabel.

03:26.336 --> 03:27.511
This is Carmen.

03:27.642 --> 03:29.426
Hello, Mrs. Rivi.

03:32.168 --> 03:35.040
The hospital administrator
told the lawyer

03:35.171 --> 03:38.000
that if we really
had this Dr. Debby,

03:38.130 --> 03:40.263
they would have to settle
at $5 million.

03:42.265 --> 03:44.833
Would $5 million be acceptable
to you, Mr. Rivi?

03:44.963 --> 03:46.487
Anything to make them hurt.

03:46.617 --> 03:49.272
I want them to know
they hurt my daughter.

03:49.403 --> 03:50.273
Nice meeting you.

03:50.404 --> 03:52.406
Thank you.

03:53.972 --> 03:56.192
Thank you
for sitting down with me.

03:56.323 --> 03:59.978
I just want to make sure that,
this, this hand-off is, uh,

04:00.109 --> 04:02.633
seamless and nothing
falls through the cracks.

04:02.764 --> 04:05.593
I appreciate that, as does Kurt.

04:05.723 --> 04:08.596
I've been in touch
with the FBI, Madeline Starkey.

04:08.726 --> 04:10.511
Her, uh, suspect, Dylan Pike,

04:10.641 --> 04:13.209
he's not as tight-lipped
as Kurt.

04:13.340 --> 04:15.690
No one is as tight-lipped
as my husband.

04:15.820 --> 04:16.691
How can I help?

04:16.821 --> 04:18.562
On a scale of one to ten,

04:18.693 --> 04:21.565
what is Kurt's willingness
to take a deal?

04:25.177 --> 04:27.136
He's not on that scale.

04:27.267 --> 04:28.616
That is not an option.

04:28.746 --> 04:30.052
I'm fairly certain

04:30.182 --> 04:33.055
that I can get him
less than one year.

04:33.185 --> 04:35.144
-Two-year probation.
-Why are you even discussing
deals?

04:35.275 --> 04:36.711
Kurt is innocent.

04:36.841 --> 04:38.278
So was I.

04:38.408 --> 04:42.064
But we decided that jail time
was the best option.

04:42.194 --> 04:43.587
You know as well as I, that...

04:43.718 --> 04:45.502
sometimes,
it's not about innocence.

04:47.852 --> 04:49.289
Jay brought you
some information.

04:49.419 --> 04:50.768
What was it?

04:50.899 --> 04:52.248
I can't divulge that.

04:52.379 --> 04:55.947
He clearly found something
incriminating about Kurt,

04:56.078 --> 04:57.732
or you wouldn't
even be considering a plea.

04:57.862 --> 04:59.734
Diane, I'm not at liberty
to discuss priv...

04:59.864 --> 05:01.301
Your lawyer-client privilege

05:01.431 --> 05:03.346
extends to everyone
at this firm.

05:03.477 --> 05:05.217
You're not asking me
as a lawyer.

05:05.348 --> 05:07.089
You're asking me as his wife.

05:07.219 --> 05:10.658
And I'm not going to participate
in any charade

05:10.788 --> 05:13.138
that ignores the spousal issues
at play here.

05:16.011 --> 05:17.404
Then I should leave.

05:21.625 --> 05:23.323
Talk to your husband, Diane.

05:24.759 --> 05:26.935
He gives me permission,

05:27.065 --> 05:28.589
I can talk.

05:35.030 --> 05:36.292
Bad news.

05:36.423 --> 05:37.511
Same.

05:37.641 --> 05:38.729
You first.

05:38.860 --> 05:40.165
I found Dr. Debby.

05:40.296 --> 05:42.646
Her full name
is Deborah Hammond,

05:42.777 --> 05:45.345
and she passed away,
two weeks ago from COVID.

05:45.475 --> 05:46.694
Darn.

05:47.738 --> 05:49.087
You say "darn."

05:49.218 --> 05:51.046
I won't be offended
if you say "damn."

05:51.176 --> 05:52.352
Parental training.

05:52.482 --> 05:53.396
Ah.

05:53.614 --> 05:55.006
I also start every email
with "Dear."

06:00.664 --> 06:01.970
-What?
-Uh...

06:02.100 --> 06:03.537
Nothing. Uh...

06:03.667 --> 06:05.190
-G-Go ahead.
-Are you okay?

06:05.321 --> 06:07.105
Uh, yes. It's just the lights.

06:07.236 --> 06:08.933
I had a COVID thing last year.

06:09.064 --> 06:11.109
-It's nothing serious.
-Oh. Uh...

06:11.240 --> 06:13.895
Harbor Hospital sent over
the breakdowns we subpoenaed,

06:14.025 --> 06:16.898
but their stats don't show
any substantial disparity

06:17.028 --> 06:18.813
between races
when it comes to COVID deaths.

06:18.943 --> 06:20.945
We need to find someone
at the hospital

06:21.076 --> 06:23.557
willing to back up
Dr. Debby's allegations.

06:25.210 --> 06:26.516
I'll get on that.

06:37.353 --> 06:38.789
-Yes?
-Uh...

06:38.963 --> 06:41.792
A bunch of us hit the bar across
the street, on Wednesdays,

06:41.923 --> 06:42.924
to de-stress.

06:43.054 --> 06:45.013
If you ever want to join us,

06:45.143 --> 06:46.275
we'd love to have you.

06:46.406 --> 06:47.929
I generally like
to cling to my stress.

06:48.059 --> 06:48.973
It keeps me sharp.

06:51.236 --> 06:52.716
I'll think about it.

07:00.898 --> 07:02.247
You're not hearing me.

07:02.378 --> 07:03.727
I hear every word you say.

07:03.858 --> 07:06.251
Then why are you willfully
withholding information?

07:06.382 --> 07:07.339
Anything you tell me

07:07.514 --> 07:08.689
is protected by the firm's
privilege

07:08.819 --> 07:10.386
and marital privilege.

07:10.517 --> 07:12.257
Then why did you call the FBI?

07:14.999 --> 07:16.610
-Maybe I should go.
-No, stay.

07:18.525 --> 07:21.136
It was the right thing to do.

07:22.529 --> 07:25.183
I never thought it would
blow back on you.

07:28.099 --> 07:29.579
Um, okay.

07:29.710 --> 07:31.842
We need to discuss
this Congressional tour

07:31.973 --> 07:34.062
that you arranged
for Dylan Pike,

07:34.192 --> 07:35.455
the day before the insurrection.

07:35.585 --> 07:37.152
Pike was a veteran.

07:37.282 --> 07:38.545
You work at the VA.

07:38.675 --> 07:40.634
Helping him was,
was part of your job.

07:40.764 --> 07:42.636
We're not constructing
rebuttal, yet.

07:42.766 --> 07:46.204
I want to hear, in Kurt's own
words, what he was thinking.

07:46.335 --> 07:48.903
I was doing him a favor.
He asked.

07:49.033 --> 07:50.818
I made a call. That's it.

07:53.385 --> 07:55.910
Do you plan on being a part
of every conversation

07:56.040 --> 07:57.651
I have with Kurt?

07:57.781 --> 07:59.217
Maybe.

08:00.262 --> 08:01.785
I'm a good lawyer, Diane.

08:01.916 --> 08:04.527
But I'm a lousy
couples therapist.

08:04.658 --> 08:07.312
You could find one of those
for a lot less.

08:07.443 --> 08:09.880
Did I make you think
I wanted a therapist?

08:10.011 --> 08:13.101
I just need to know when
I'm talking to my colleague,

08:13.231 --> 08:15.407
and when I'm talking
to Kurt's wife.

08:17.105 --> 08:18.236
Okay.

08:18.367 --> 08:20.151
Let me ask you, as his wife,

08:20.282 --> 08:22.589
are you still talking
about taking a deal?

08:22.719 --> 08:24.025
No.

08:24.155 --> 08:25.200
He's done nothing wrong.

08:27.028 --> 08:29.117
And if I ask you as a lawyer?

08:30.858 --> 08:32.033
It's not good.

08:33.077 --> 08:34.601
The Feds want a head.

08:45.263 --> 08:46.743
So, you shot Dr. Debby's videos?

08:46.874 --> 08:48.310
Yeah.

08:48.484 --> 08:50.094
Yeah, I tried to do
the one-shot <i>Goodfellas</i> thing

08:50.225 --> 08:51.400
down the hallway, into the ICU.

08:51.531 --> 08:53.402
But?

08:53.533 --> 08:54.925
Fucking hospital rules.

08:55.056 --> 08:56.797
I had to keep throwing in a cut.

08:56.927 --> 08:59.060
Dr. Debby had you upload
the videos to TikTok?

08:59.190 --> 09:01.323
Yeah. I edited them together
with a whip pan.

09:01.453 --> 09:02.716
I got this really cool software.

09:02.846 --> 09:04.500
What do you mean,
"edited them together"?

09:04.631 --> 09:06.371
TikTok only lets you upload
about a minute.

09:06.502 --> 09:09.461
You know, four 15-second videos
strung together.

09:09.592 --> 09:11.986
I helped Dr. Debby
pick which takes to use.

09:12.116 --> 09:13.857
I added the captions,
the filters.

09:13.988 --> 09:15.555
I added the whip pan.

09:15.685 --> 09:18.166
-She did a lot of takes?
-God, yes.

09:19.646 --> 09:21.125
<i>People think this disease</i>

09:21.256 --> 09:23.475
<i>only affects old people
or poor people.</i>

09:23.606 --> 09:24.912
<i>But let me tell you...</i>

09:25.042 --> 09:28.959
<i>Last week, the husband
of our CEO was admitted.</i>

09:29.090 --> 09:30.482
<i>Sharon Booth's husband.</i>

09:30.613 --> 09:32.833
<i>Of course, they rolled out
the red carpet for him.</i>

09:32.963 --> 09:36.488
<i>Which meant we had to move five
other patients out of the ICU.</i>

09:36.619 --> 09:38.665
<i>Poor things.</i>

09:40.667 --> 09:42.582
Can I get a copy of this?

10:21.708 --> 10:23.187
Look out. Coming through.

10:24.232 --> 10:26.408
Coming through!
Coming through!

10:26.538 --> 10:28.802
-Coming through! Move!

10:28.932 --> 10:30.281
This guy's in bad shape.

10:30.412 --> 10:32.283
-Out of the way!

10:55.263 --> 10:56.264
Hi, Diane.

10:56.394 --> 10:58.440
Ugh, why isn't
my office like this?

10:58.570 --> 11:00.921
-Your view's so pretty.
-What do you want, Madeline?

11:01.051 --> 11:03.184
I want that throw pillow,
two of them, just like that.

11:03.314 --> 11:05.360
I'm not Kurt's lawyer anymore.

11:05.490 --> 11:06.404
This way.

11:06.666 --> 11:08.189
Well, I think you
should see these.

11:08.319 --> 11:11.322
I'm not Mr. McVeigh's lawyer.

11:11.453 --> 11:12.584
Yes, but you are his wife.

11:12.715 --> 11:14.238
As you can see,
these are the bullets

11:14.369 --> 11:17.285
taken from your apartment
when we searched it.

11:21.681 --> 11:23.726
As you can see,
when we opened the boxes

11:23.857 --> 11:25.859
of Kurt's shotgun shells...
Hold on. Hold on.

11:25.989 --> 11:28.209
We found initials drawn
on each of the shells.

11:28.339 --> 11:30.254
Look, here's a T.M.

11:30.385 --> 11:31.516
A B.T.

11:31.647 --> 11:32.692
Another T.M.

11:35.869 --> 11:38.567
At first, we were confused
about the whole initials thing.

11:38.698 --> 11:40.569
You know?
But then Dylan Pike pointed out

11:40.700 --> 11:42.876
that they were the initials
of legislators

11:43.006 --> 11:44.529
of the Illinois
General Assembly.

11:44.660 --> 11:46.096
Could you get security up here?

11:46.227 --> 11:48.055
-This woman is harassing me.
-Harassing?

11:48.185 --> 11:50.231
Someone like me?
A federal agent.

11:50.361 --> 11:52.755
This federal agent
is harassing me.

11:52.886 --> 11:54.452
Please ask security
to meet me upstairs.

11:54.583 --> 11:57.499
So, that's right,
Dylan Pike informed us

11:57.629 --> 12:00.720
that your husband has designs
on a similar insurrection

12:00.850 --> 12:02.809
against the General Assembly.

12:02.939 --> 12:05.333
He also had these zip ties,

12:05.463 --> 12:08.336
and plans to kidnap
five top Springfield legislators

12:08.466 --> 12:10.555
and put them on trial. Whoa.

12:12.079 --> 12:14.298
You understand,
I'm a seasoned lawyer.

12:14.429 --> 12:15.691
This doesn't work on me.

12:15.822 --> 12:17.171
I'm not going to run

12:17.301 --> 12:19.260
crying to my husband,
"How could you?"

12:19.390 --> 12:21.871
The very fact that you came
to me and not Kurt's lawyer

12:22.002 --> 12:23.612
shows how weak
you think your evidence is.

12:23.743 --> 12:25.701
So, here's a piece of advice,
Madeline,

12:25.832 --> 12:27.747
one wife to another.

12:27.877 --> 12:30.358
If you believe these photos,
don't bring them to me.

12:30.488 --> 12:33.013
Take them to Julius,
and tell him to make a deal.

12:33.143 --> 12:34.405
And good luck.

12:42.370 --> 12:45.025
I'm going to guess
you're Carmen Moyo.

12:46.026 --> 12:47.505
I am.

12:47.636 --> 12:48.637
Who are you?

12:48.768 --> 12:50.857
Ricardo Diaz.

12:50.987 --> 12:53.511
Well, only my mother
calls me Ricardo though.

12:53.642 --> 12:55.165
Most people call me Racehorse.

12:55.296 --> 12:56.253
Right.

12:56.384 --> 12:58.168
Where's Mr. Glubman?

12:58.299 --> 13:00.780
I don't know.

13:00.910 --> 13:02.912
When I called him, he was crying

13:03.043 --> 13:04.696
too much to explain
where he was.

13:04.827 --> 13:07.221
Maybe you were too formidable
an adversary.

13:07.351 --> 13:09.745
You're his replacement,
Mr. Diaz?

13:09.876 --> 13:11.181
Just Racehorse is fine.

13:11.312 --> 13:13.531
Well, Mr. Glubman promised me
a settlement offer.

13:13.662 --> 13:16.447
Yeah, well,
that's not going to happen.

13:18.406 --> 13:20.147
I enjoy fighting too much.

13:20.277 --> 13:22.845
And you look like
a fun opponent.

13:22.976 --> 13:25.761
Look, I hope you don't mind if
I depose one of your witnesses,

13:25.892 --> 13:27.807
a Dr. Deborah Hammond.

13:27.937 --> 13:29.025
Dr. TikTok.

13:29.156 --> 13:31.462
Dr. Hammond is deceased.

13:31.593 --> 13:33.987
Well, that ought to keep
her answers brief.

13:35.162 --> 13:38.818
I seem to remember hearing
that there was an acute shortage

13:38.948 --> 13:43.518
of trained medical personnel
due to the COVID pandemic.

13:43.648 --> 13:45.825
Is that what you remember
as well, Doctor?

13:45.955 --> 13:48.044
Okay, uh, are we done here?

13:48.175 --> 13:50.830
Yet, even in the midst
of a nationwide shortage,

13:50.960 --> 13:51.831
you were let go.

13:51.961 --> 13:53.702
See, the way I see it,

13:53.833 --> 13:55.008
smells of incompetence.

13:55.138 --> 13:56.444
Or retaliation.

13:56.574 --> 13:58.446
See, I wonder, Doctor,
if you wouldn't agree

13:58.576 --> 14:00.448
that there are a number
of factors that go into

14:00.578 --> 14:02.102
the type of treatment
a patient receives,

14:02.232 --> 14:05.148
and some that have nothing
to do with race or connections.

14:05.279 --> 14:07.890
For instance, there's
the patient's own wishes.

14:08.021 --> 14:09.544
Is Harbor Hospital prepared

14:09.674 --> 14:11.589
-to make a settlement offer?
-No.

14:11.720 --> 14:14.244
But they are prepared
to respond to one.

14:14.375 --> 14:16.551
You see,
as of 9:00 a.m. this morning,

14:16.681 --> 14:18.466
a counterclaim for defamation
was filed

14:18.596 --> 14:21.077
-on Harbor Hospital's behalf.
-Great negotiating tactic.

14:21.208 --> 14:23.297
Here's the thing, Miss Moyo.

14:23.427 --> 14:27.649
Ask your drug-kingpin client if
he's happy about being deposed.

14:27.779 --> 14:30.217
Remind him he has to answer
every question I ask him

14:30.347 --> 14:31.479
on the record.

14:31.609 --> 14:33.089
Then we'll talk settlement.

14:33.220 --> 14:34.264
I'll get back to you.

14:34.395 --> 14:35.700
Hmm.

14:38.225 --> 14:40.792
You're a year out of law school,
sweetums.

14:40.923 --> 14:44.884
Let's see how you do
against a real lawyer.

14:45.928 --> 14:47.408
Good luck.

16:33.340 --> 16:34.994
So...

16:35.124 --> 16:37.257
This is what the AUSA
said they found in our house

16:37.387 --> 16:38.954
when they searched.

16:39.085 --> 16:40.390
Are they yours?

16:40.521 --> 16:41.565
Yes.

16:41.696 --> 16:44.525
The shotgun shells
and the zip ties?

16:44.655 --> 16:45.917
Yes.

16:46.048 --> 16:48.529
Dylan Pike says
you're leading an insurrection

16:48.659 --> 16:51.836
of the Illinois Assembly,
and these are the initials

16:51.967 --> 16:55.623
of the legislators
that you intend for each bullet.

17:01.629 --> 17:02.760
Is that not true?

17:04.197 --> 17:08.375
Did she say why every legislator
had the same initials

17:08.505 --> 17:10.333
T.M. and B.T.?

17:12.727 --> 17:14.120
These aren't initials?

17:14.250 --> 17:17.645
No. Why would I put initials
on buckshot shells?

17:17.775 --> 17:20.604
T.M. means Tungsten-Matrix,
a metal alloy shell.

17:20.735 --> 17:23.912
And B.T. is Bismuth-Tin,
a non-toxic alloy.

17:24.043 --> 17:25.087
And the zip ties?

17:25.218 --> 17:27.176
Those are five-inch zip ties.

17:27.307 --> 17:28.482
They're too thin for humans.

17:28.612 --> 17:30.049
They're used to tag a deer.

17:30.179 --> 17:33.487
Okay, Kurt.

17:33.617 --> 17:36.968
This is where my ignorance of
hunting, uh, works against me.

17:37.099 --> 17:39.319
So, please,
feel free to keep clueing me in.

17:39.449 --> 17:41.321
Just ask me questions.

17:41.451 --> 17:42.583
And, Diane...

17:42.713 --> 17:44.585
you should never let Starkey
come to you.

17:44.715 --> 17:47.109
-You should always
send her to me.
-Please. She chased me.

17:47.240 --> 17:48.458
Don't let her chase you.

17:48.632 --> 17:51.418
The bigger issue,
if you ask me, is Dylan Pike.

17:51.548 --> 17:52.810
He's a coward.

17:52.941 --> 17:55.074
Who's lying about Kurt
to reduce his sentence.

17:55.204 --> 17:56.379
I would agree.

17:56.510 --> 17:58.425
Which is why,
it's-it's just insane, Kurt,

17:58.555 --> 17:59.687
for you to stay silent.

17:59.817 --> 18:00.992
And I know it's your code.

18:01.254 --> 18:03.517
-Your stupid cowboy code.
-You keep saying that.

18:03.647 --> 18:05.432
-Because it's true.
-No.

18:05.562 --> 18:07.173
No, because I don't like
how the authorities

18:07.303 --> 18:09.653
use lies like these
to get me to turn on someone.

18:09.784 --> 18:11.699
Dylan Pike is going to send you
to prison,

18:11.829 --> 18:13.918
because he knows
you won't respond to his lies.

18:14.049 --> 18:17.052
I mean, John Wayne doesn't punch
first, but he does punch back.

18:17.183 --> 18:20.360
-I'm just a John Wayne cartoon
to you?
Wait. Wait. Wait.

18:20.490 --> 18:21.839
Kurt, you don't
want to name names.

18:21.970 --> 18:23.711
I can respect that.

18:23.841 --> 18:25.887
But, uh, how did Dylan Pike

18:26.017 --> 18:28.498
know about the marking system
on your shells?

18:28.629 --> 18:30.544
We talked when we were
at the firing range.

18:30.674 --> 18:33.242
And were there
other people there?

18:36.506 --> 18:38.247
I can't say that.

18:38.378 --> 18:40.902
But you can talk
to those other people.

18:41.032 --> 18:43.470
And if they contradict
what Pike was saying,

18:43.600 --> 18:45.907
then, maybe,
we can undercut the Feds' case.

18:46.037 --> 18:48.475
So, you're saying
that Kurt could go

18:48.605 --> 18:51.521
to these other witnesses
and get them to back him up?

18:51.652 --> 18:52.696
Yeah.

18:52.827 --> 18:55.438
Then Kurt
isn't turning over names.

19:02.532 --> 19:05.274
Marissa, what are you doing?
I need your help.

19:05.405 --> 19:07.146
<i>I need you to follow someone.</i>

19:07.276 --> 19:10.105
Are you sure you don't want to
be asking Jay to handle this?

19:10.236 --> 19:11.802
<i>Since he's
a full-time investigator.</i>

19:11.933 --> 19:13.630
No. I'm asking you.

19:13.761 --> 19:15.545
Okay.

19:15.676 --> 19:17.025
I'll get on it.

19:18.244 --> 19:19.593
Ugh.

19:39.134 --> 19:40.788
Ms. Reddick,

19:40.918 --> 19:44.052
you've met Mr. Rivi,
and this is his wife Isabel.

19:46.881 --> 19:50.189
Isabel is asking for you
to wait outside, Carmen.

19:51.364 --> 19:52.539
Of course.

19:57.979 --> 20:00.677
I have to interpret for her.

20:00.808 --> 20:03.158
We lost our interpreter
last week.

20:03.289 --> 20:04.855
<i>Bueno. Dale.</i>

20:09.512 --> 20:12.559
Harbor Hospital replaced
their lawyer with a ringer.

20:12.689 --> 20:14.213
Racehorse Diaz.

20:14.343 --> 20:16.519
Yes. That is my understanding,
but...

20:16.650 --> 20:18.086
h-he's a mercenary.

20:20.175 --> 20:22.046
But a tough mercenary.

20:22.177 --> 20:24.527
Diaz wins every case he takes.

20:24.658 --> 20:26.312
But he's not unbeatable.

20:31.969 --> 20:33.449
-No!

20:33.580 --> 20:35.495
No. <i>!¡Carajo!</i>

20:45.592 --> 20:48.247
"I don't want that girl
on our case..."

20:48.377 --> 20:52.207
Oh, uh, Mrs. Rivi,
Carmen is very resourceful.

20:52.338 --> 20:54.253
And I'm not as up-to-date
on your case.

20:54.383 --> 20:55.776
I-I would only hold her back.

20:55.906 --> 20:57.212
Does our business matter to you?

20:57.343 --> 20:58.387
Of course.

21:01.085 --> 21:03.305
Your associates,
across the hall,

21:03.436 --> 21:06.395
joked about my husband being...

21:07.744 --> 21:10.791
...a killer wetback?

21:10.921 --> 21:12.271
They what?

21:12.401 --> 21:16.623
I want to know
if our business matters to you.

21:16.753 --> 21:19.408
Because we can easily take it
somewhere else.

21:19.539 --> 21:21.280
Mrs. Rivi, Mr. Rivi...

21:21.410 --> 21:24.500
I apologize
for my associates' behavior.

21:24.631 --> 21:26.372
I will read up on your case,

21:26.502 --> 21:28.417
and I will join it today.

21:38.993 --> 21:41.604
Did one of you
use a Mexican slur about Rivi?

21:43.302 --> 21:44.694
You're all fired.

21:44.825 --> 21:46.000
All of you.

21:46.130 --> 21:48.307
Collect your things and go, now.

21:51.484 --> 21:53.921
You took these videos,
Mr. Novacek?

21:54.051 --> 21:55.226
Am I pronouncing
your name correctly?

21:55.357 --> 21:57.881
Yeah. And yeah,
I took the videos.

21:58.012 --> 21:59.927
Let me show you another one.

22:00.057 --> 22:01.668
<i>Oh, I want some food.</i>

22:01.798 --> 22:03.452
<i>I'm hungry.</i>

22:03.583 --> 22:04.584
<i>Where's my food?</i>

22:04.714 --> 22:05.976
Cute.

22:06.107 --> 22:07.456
What is your point,
Mr. Racehorse?

22:07.587 --> 22:09.023
Hmm.

22:09.153 --> 22:10.590
Let me tell you, Mrs. Reddick.

22:10.720 --> 22:12.592
It's so good
to have you join us.

22:12.722 --> 22:14.333
I welcome the competition.

22:14.463 --> 22:15.986
Now, did you take
that Tiktok video too, Elliot?

22:16.117 --> 22:18.162
No.

22:18.293 --> 22:19.338
But you posted it for Dr. Debby?

22:19.468 --> 22:21.252
-Yes.
-Good.

22:21.383 --> 22:22.906
Let me show you another one.

She's a bad person
because she made fun videos?

22:37.181 --> 22:39.009
So, tell me, Mr. Novacek,
did Dr. Debby

22:39.140 --> 22:40.576
give you specific instructions

22:40.707 --> 22:43.057
as to the time of day
to post her videos on TikTok?

22:43.187 --> 22:44.363
Yeah. 6:00 a.m. to 10:00 a.m.

22:44.493 --> 22:46.669
Hmm. And why was that?

22:46.800 --> 22:48.758
It's the best window
for follower engagement.

22:48.889 --> 22:51.282
Much as I don't want
to disparage the good doc,

22:51.413 --> 22:54.068
it seems her social media
popularity was...

22:54.198 --> 22:55.983
-Important?
-Objection.

22:56.113 --> 22:57.288
On what grounds?

22:57.419 --> 22:59.203
General asshole-ry.

22:59.334 --> 23:02.250
Did Dr. Debby ever mention
to you why she cared

23:02.381 --> 23:04.165
about follower engagement?

23:04.295 --> 23:07.168
-I mean, it's not a bad thing.
-I'm not judging, just asking.

23:09.083 --> 23:10.301
Uh, she was trying
to build her brand.

23:10.432 --> 23:11.999
She thought she could get on

23:12.129 --> 23:14.088
one of those <i>
Married to Medicine</i> spinoffs.

23:18.266 --> 23:19.572
<i>Dr. Debby?</i>

23:19.702 --> 23:23.314
She was heroic for her patients.

23:23.445 --> 23:24.881
She cared.

23:25.012 --> 23:27.841
So, you don't think
she was looking for attention?

23:27.971 --> 23:30.887
Look, I don't want
to speak ill of the dead, but...

23:32.454 --> 23:34.238
...she was complicated.

23:34.369 --> 23:36.197
A clout chaser.

23:36.327 --> 23:38.895
She'd pull folks
from their stations

23:39.026 --> 23:40.723
to do confessionals
for the camera.

23:40.854 --> 23:42.029
Could that be interpreted

23:42.159 --> 23:44.248
as just trying
to get the message out?

23:44.379 --> 23:45.424
Yeah, well,
that's less important

23:45.554 --> 23:46.773
when we needed her,
and she was down

23:46.903 --> 23:48.427
some social media rabbit hole.

Yeah.

25:43.890 --> 25:46.066
Why Mexico?

25:47.067 --> 25:48.547
I want to go one day.

25:48.677 --> 25:50.244
I've never been.

25:50.374 --> 25:53.377
I-I've been to Puerto Vallarta.

25:53.508 --> 25:55.336
The beach is pretty.

25:55.466 --> 25:57.120
Real pretty.

26:04.084 --> 26:05.868
Why are we here?

26:06.956 --> 26:08.697
We're...

26:08.828 --> 26:10.786
Because we're dying.

26:14.181 --> 26:16.139
When did you last see a doctor?

26:17.924 --> 26:19.360
Yesterday.

26:20.622 --> 26:23.451
No. No, it was, it was...
It was Thursday.

26:25.148 --> 26:27.237
What's your name?

26:27.368 --> 26:30.327
-Woody.
-Jay.

26:33.679 --> 26:34.723
I'm reaching out my hand.

26:34.854 --> 26:36.812
Can, can you grab it?

26:36.943 --> 26:38.466
I'm trying.

26:40.294 --> 26:42.078
Let's do this.

26:42.209 --> 26:44.167
Let's keep each other alive.

26:44.298 --> 26:45.386
Okay?

26:46.430 --> 26:48.128
Okay.

26:57.093 --> 26:58.486
What is that?

27:00.793 --> 27:02.838
Oh, I don't know.

27:02.969 --> 27:04.535
What number do you
want it to be?

27:11.891 --> 27:13.632
I don't know.

27:13.762 --> 27:15.895
I don't know either.

27:33.913 --> 27:35.654
We should not be talking.

27:37.612 --> 27:38.744
You heard about Dylan?

27:38.874 --> 27:40.441
I don't want any part of it.
I'm actually

27:40.571 --> 27:42.269
trying to de-stress here,
if you don't mind.

27:42.399 --> 27:44.575
Dylan told the FBI
that I was planning

27:44.706 --> 27:46.142
to assault
the Illinois Assembly.

27:46.273 --> 27:47.753
Kurt...

27:47.883 --> 27:51.017
My mother agreed to babysit
an hour a week. I had to beg.

27:51.147 --> 27:52.627
This is my
mommy-rejuvenation time.

27:52.758 --> 27:54.890
It would really help me

27:55.021 --> 27:57.110
if you would tell
the authorities the truth.

27:57.240 --> 27:59.242
You did not give them my name,
did you?

27:59.373 --> 28:00.374
I wouldn't do that.

28:00.504 --> 28:02.593
There were others there;
ask them.

28:02.724 --> 28:04.030
I did.

28:04.160 --> 28:06.206
They won't come forward.

28:08.948 --> 28:10.601
All I can see...

28:10.732 --> 28:12.778
is my little girl...

28:12.908 --> 28:13.779
without me.

28:13.909 --> 28:15.650
I cannot do that to her.

28:15.781 --> 28:18.131
I have to protect my child.

28:18.261 --> 28:19.698
I cannot get arrested.

28:19.828 --> 28:21.656
You won't.

28:21.787 --> 28:22.875
I'm really sorry.

28:23.005 --> 28:24.703
But my daughter comes first.

28:24.833 --> 28:26.052
Hey, stay.

28:27.009 --> 28:28.445
Fire a round with me.

28:28.576 --> 28:29.620
It helps.

28:30.665 --> 28:32.449
No.

29:16.798 --> 29:18.408
Trying to sleep?

29:20.149 --> 29:22.108
Yes.

29:22.238 --> 29:24.980

29:26.155 --> 29:28.201

Who's that?

30:05.629 --> 30:07.109
Me.

30:08.110 --> 30:09.851
Reach out your hand.

30:33.919 --> 30:36.573
Here they come.

30:36.704 --> 30:38.097
They think you're in a coma.

30:44.930 --> 30:46.583
Those are pneumonia.

30:46.714 --> 30:49.325
The rest can be heart failure.

30:55.375 --> 30:57.551
They don't think we're
conscious, do they?

30:58.857 --> 31:01.685
No. You're in a coma.

31:08.779 --> 31:10.042
As far as I know,

31:10.172 --> 31:12.435
the Hippocratic Oath only
covers medicine,

31:12.566 --> 31:14.046
not TikTok.

31:14.176 --> 31:17.701
So, you deny your husband
received any special treatment?

31:17.832 --> 31:20.139
I think she already said that,
but sure,

31:20.269 --> 31:21.575
let's have her say it again.

31:21.749 --> 31:24.012
All right. This time
I'll make it more interesting.

31:24.143 --> 31:26.319
Our hospital staff has gone
through anti-racism training,

31:26.449 --> 31:27.798
and it is a priority for us

31:27.929 --> 31:29.931
that we give all of our patients
the equivalent care.

31:30.062 --> 31:32.020
-Irrespective of race?
-Yes.

31:32.151 --> 31:35.328
We've had more deaths in
our hospital from heart failure

31:35.458 --> 31:37.025
and pneumonia than from COVID.

31:37.156 --> 31:39.549
Great. Well, can-can
I see those numbers?

31:39.680 --> 31:42.074
Ask about
pneumonia deaths by race.

31:42.204 --> 31:43.640
I think they switched
COVID deaths

31:43.771 --> 31:45.599
to pneumonia among Blacks.

31:45.729 --> 31:48.558
-How do you know?
-I don't. Ask.

31:48.689 --> 31:51.692
Pretty straightforward.
I mean, if you say...
-May I interrupt?

31:53.302 --> 31:55.696
I have a quick question to ask,
if you don't mind.

31:55.826 --> 31:56.958
-Go ahead.
-Ms. Booth,

31:57.176 --> 31:59.526
do you know the racial
breakdowns for pneumonia

31:59.656 --> 32:01.223
and heart failure deaths
at Harbor Hospital?

32:01.354 --> 32:02.964
Not off the top of my head, no.

32:03.095 --> 32:04.313
No problem.

32:04.444 --> 32:05.706
We'll subpoena them.

32:05.836 --> 32:08.752
Do you have any idea
how many people of color,

32:08.883 --> 32:11.581
whose cause of death was listed
as pneumonia or heart failure,

32:11.712 --> 32:13.322
<i>also had COVID?</i>

32:13.453 --> 32:14.715
<i>There was some overlap there</i>

32:14.845 --> 32:17.022
with patients of all races,

32:17.152 --> 32:20.851
but I-I don't have the specific
numbers at this time.

32:23.767 --> 32:26.683
Did the hospital staff, in fact,

32:26.814 --> 32:29.338
reclassify 67 COVID deaths
among Blacks as pneumonia,

32:29.469 --> 32:32.385
so that only 37 were listed?

32:34.082 --> 32:35.301
How...

32:35.431 --> 32:36.563
How did you get that number?

32:36.693 --> 32:37.781
That's not the question.

32:37.912 --> 32:40.088
The question is whether
it's accurate?

32:41.089 --> 32:42.830
The hosp...

32:44.353 --> 32:46.225
I will have to check
with my staff.

32:46.355 --> 32:47.356
Well, please do.

32:47.487 --> 32:48.662
We'll be waiting.

32:48.792 --> 32:49.793
Let's call a recess.

32:49.968 --> 32:51.839
I wouldn't mind
stretching my legs.

32:51.970 --> 32:52.883
Yes.

32:53.014 --> 32:54.885
Take your time stretching them,

32:55.016 --> 32:56.017
Racehorse.

33:04.286 --> 33:05.984
Where did you get that number?

33:06.114 --> 33:07.420
I was at the hospital.

33:07.550 --> 33:09.552
Yeah, but where
did you get the number?

33:10.597 --> 33:11.946
A memory.

33:12.077 --> 33:14.514
Can we get any more
of these memories?

33:16.342 --> 33:17.821
I don't know.

33:25.177 --> 33:26.656
-What else?
-What else do I remember

33:26.787 --> 33:27.875
-from being at the hospital?
-Yes.

33:28.049 --> 33:29.094
I checked the records,
and you were there

33:29.224 --> 33:30.356
the same time as Pia.

33:30.486 --> 33:32.097
What I remember...

33:32.227 --> 33:33.663
-won't be helpful.
-Why not?

33:33.794 --> 33:36.710
Well, I remember
Frederick Douglass and Karl Marx

33:36.840 --> 33:38.407
sitting in a corner
talking to me.

33:38.538 --> 33:40.018
That's not a good idea.

33:40.148 --> 33:42.977
-You had hallucinations?
-Yes.

33:43.108 --> 33:44.848
So, you're not sure what's real

33:44.979 --> 33:46.154
-and what isn't?
-Yes.

33:46.285 --> 33:47.938
But the number
of COVID deaths being reduced,

33:48.156 --> 33:49.505
-you had an exact number.
No one
wants an investigator

33:49.636 --> 33:50.898
who can't distinguish
between reality

33:51.029 --> 33:52.378
and hallucinations.

33:52.508 --> 33:53.944
Could you say that again?

33:54.075 --> 33:56.251
-No one wants a...
-But the number...
-Not you.

33:57.557 --> 33:59.602
Are you hallucinating now?

33:59.733 --> 34:00.821
Uh-oh.

34:00.951 --> 34:02.953
I have some long-haul
COVID symptoms.

34:03.084 --> 34:05.913
And that results in some...

34:06.044 --> 34:08.133
-cloudiness in my thinking.
-Good.

34:08.263 --> 34:10.265
-"Cloudiness" is good.
-But your memories

34:10.396 --> 34:12.137
about the reduced COVID numbers,

34:12.267 --> 34:13.529
-they were specific.
-Hmm.

34:13.660 --> 34:15.183
That's because
the nurses thought

34:15.314 --> 34:16.663
you were in a coma
and couldn't hear them.

34:16.793 --> 34:19.535
-But he was in a coma.
-Right, and he could hear

34:19.666 --> 34:22.277
-in a coma.
-The soul transcends the body...

34:22.408 --> 34:23.322
-For a few weeks,

34:23.452 --> 34:25.063
I was in a coma and...

34:25.193 --> 34:26.847
I could hear the nurses
talking over me.

34:26.977 --> 34:28.414
Uh, they
couldn't hear me...

34:28.544 --> 34:29.937
-What? What?

34:30.068 --> 34:32.592
So, you heard them admit things

34:32.722 --> 34:34.202
they wouldn't admit
to a patient?

34:35.160 --> 34:37.162
Or you imagined you heard them?

34:37.292 --> 34:38.598
That's the question.

34:38.728 --> 34:40.078
See, I'm not sure.

34:43.646 --> 34:45.300
Could we talk over here?

34:46.345 --> 34:47.694
Okay.

34:49.087 --> 34:51.437
I'll need you to go back
through all your memories,

34:51.567 --> 34:53.221
and try and distinguish
between the real ones

34:53.352 --> 34:55.093
and the imagined ones.

34:56.529 --> 34:57.660
Are you okay?

34:57.791 --> 34:59.140
Yes.

34:59.271 --> 35:00.837
Functional, anyway.

35:02.883 --> 35:04.450
-Thank you.
-Mm-hmm.

35:13.372 --> 35:15.504
Oh, here we all are.

35:15.635 --> 35:17.854
Diane, I'm so glad
you could make it.

35:17.985 --> 35:19.160
Yes. And as long as
you know that Diane

35:19.291 --> 35:20.640
is not Kurt's lawyer-- I am.

35:20.814 --> 35:23.425
I just thought it was best
to keep us all up-to-date.

35:23.556 --> 35:25.819
And thank you for meeting me
out here.

35:25.949 --> 35:26.994
They're cleaning my windows.

35:27.125 --> 35:29.039
They get a bit coated.

35:29.170 --> 35:30.824
I would like to update you
on, uh,

35:30.954 --> 35:32.652
just a few things
you presented to Diane.

35:32.782 --> 35:34.349
Oh, the shotgun shells. Yeah.

35:34.480 --> 35:36.569
Apparently, your husband
made them all by himself.

35:36.699 --> 35:38.266
-U-Uh, Madeline.
-Mm-hmm?

35:38.397 --> 35:39.963
Dylan Pike is playing you.

35:40.094 --> 35:42.227
The markings
are about pellet count.

35:42.357 --> 35:45.969
T.M. is Tungsten-Matrix.
B.T. is Bismuth-Tin.

35:46.100 --> 35:47.319
Well, that's not all I've got.

35:47.449 --> 35:49.451
Yes, the, uh, zip ties.

35:49.582 --> 35:51.061
-Mm-hmm.
-Not for humans.

35:51.192 --> 35:52.411
They're for tagging deer.

35:52.541 --> 35:53.760
-Check online.

35:53.890 --> 35:56.589
Yeah, well.
That's not all I've got.

35:56.719 --> 35:58.547
Ah, yes.
I hope not, because this is...

35:58.678 --> 35:59.896
This is disappointing.

36:00.027 --> 36:01.550
-Mm-hmm. Yeah.

36:01.681 --> 36:03.813
Sorry. We still haven't solved
the bird problem, but, um...

36:03.944 --> 36:06.599
You might want to look...

36:06.729 --> 36:07.817
at that.

36:07.948 --> 36:10.298
-What is that?
-It's Kurt's manifesto.

36:10.429 --> 36:11.560
-Really?
-Mm-hmm.

36:11.734 --> 36:12.561
Yeah, it's calling
on like-minded patriots

36:12.692 --> 36:14.302
to stand up for their rights,

36:14.433 --> 36:17.131
-to not allow the left
to push them out.

36:17.262 --> 36:19.438
"We can have the nation we want,
but they're not

36:19.568 --> 36:22.136
going to just give it to us.
We'll have to fight for it."

36:22.267 --> 36:23.964
-Kurt didn't write that.
-Diane...

36:24.094 --> 36:26.184
It is signed with a pseudonym,
true, but it was in his files.

36:26.314 --> 36:27.924
-Let me see.
-Sure.

36:28.055 --> 36:29.491
That's a copy.
You can keep that.

36:33.756 --> 36:35.541
You want one?

37:49.919 --> 37:52.270
-What is this place?

37:52.400 --> 37:54.184
Can you see what she's writing?

37:57.710 --> 37:59.668
No, I can't.

38:01.061 --> 38:03.324
Here. Pull my hand.

38:03.455 --> 38:05.065
And I'll be in position.

38:13.421 --> 38:15.684
What's it say?

38:15.815 --> 38:18.644
"No Visitors in the Pit."

38:18.774 --> 38:20.863
What's the Pit?

38:20.994 --> 38:22.517
-I think...
-Mm.

38:22.648 --> 38:24.737
I think we're in the Pit.

38:28.958 --> 38:30.569
What was the Pit, Dr. Bernard?

38:31.657 --> 38:34.486
Where is this fishing expedition
coming from, young lady?

38:34.616 --> 38:38.098
It's coming from a land called
"None of your fucking business."

38:38.228 --> 38:39.926
Would you like Ms. Moyo
to repeat the question, sir?

38:40.056 --> 38:42.015
Uh, no.

38:42.145 --> 38:44.147
Originally it was a waiting room

38:44.278 --> 38:46.498
for patients
and their family members.

38:46.628 --> 38:49.065
With the pandemic, family
members were no longer allowed

38:49.196 --> 38:52.068
on the premises, and a lot
of the hospital staff ended up

38:52.199 --> 38:54.941
using it as a break room.
Because it was in the basement,

38:55.071 --> 38:57.422
-we called it the Pit.
-The Pit?

38:57.552 --> 38:59.206
Was it outfitted
to care for patients?

38:59.337 --> 39:01.426
-No.
-So, no oxygen lines,

39:01.556 --> 39:02.992
no monitors...

39:03.123 --> 39:05.212
Was that a question? The witness
said it was a break room.

39:05.343 --> 39:07.083
We are entitled to ascertain
what was

39:07.214 --> 39:08.868
and was not in the room.

39:10.348 --> 39:12.088
In the month of April 2020,

39:12.219 --> 39:15.788
there were patients
in the break room, or Pit,

39:15.918 --> 39:17.616
-as you call it.
-We were overwhelmed.

39:17.746 --> 39:18.921
We had to make room
where we could.

39:19.052 --> 39:21.446
That included hallways, and yes,

39:21.576 --> 39:24.927
turning our break room into a...

39:25.058 --> 39:26.668
temporary patient room.

39:26.799 --> 39:28.148
Douglass Wood.

39:29.279 --> 39:33.153
Are you familiar with a patient
named Douglass Wood?

39:36.025 --> 39:37.331
-Yes.
Wait.

39:37.462 --> 39:38.680
What does this
have to do with anything?

39:38.854 --> 39:41.291
I don't know.
Why don't we find out together.

39:41.422 --> 39:42.380
According to hospital records,

39:42.510 --> 39:44.469
you were his attending physician

39:44.599 --> 39:46.209
until he was transferred
off your floor.

39:46.340 --> 39:47.559
Why was he sent to the Pit?

39:47.689 --> 39:49.125
Again, we had to maximize space.

39:49.299 --> 39:51.867
I don't think you understand
how many near-death patients

39:51.998 --> 39:54.043
were being sent to us
every single day.

39:54.174 --> 39:57.264
Had Douglass Wood ever coded
prior to being sent to the Pit?

39:57.395 --> 39:59.135
Yes. He was resuscitated twice.

39:59.266 --> 40:01.399
Were there any ventilators
in the Pit?

40:01.529 --> 40:03.052
No.

40:03.183 --> 40:06.316
So you sent someone who had
needed to be resuscitated prior

40:06.447 --> 40:09.189
to a part of the hospital that
didn't have any ventilators?

40:09.319 --> 40:12.453
-Why was that?
-He stopped responding
to treatment.

40:12.584 --> 40:14.977
We had other patients
who were responding to treatment

40:15.108 --> 40:16.762
better than he was.

40:16.892 --> 40:19.068
<i>So, you banished him
to the Pit to die?</i>

40:21.201 --> 40:23.421
Woody...

40:23.551 --> 40:26.424
-Woody, hold on to me.

40:26.554 --> 40:28.774
You think we sent anyone
down there on a whim?

40:28.904 --> 40:30.732
Intake was through the roof.

40:30.863 --> 40:34.344
There were refrigerated trucks
with bodies stacked up inside.

40:34.475 --> 40:37.609
We were working to the point of
physical and mental exhaustion.

40:39.349 --> 40:42.091
Douglass Wood and Pia Rivi died

40:42.222 --> 40:44.137
because, back then,

40:44.267 --> 40:46.879
we knew less about the virus
than we know now.

40:47.009 --> 40:49.011
Blame the federal government
for that, not me.

40:49.142 --> 40:52.232
Well, are you aware, Doctor,
that the overwhelming majority

40:52.362 --> 40:55.322
of patients who were sent to
the Pit, including Douglass Wood

40:55.453 --> 40:57.890
and Pia Rivi,
were Black or brown?

41:04.505 --> 41:08.117
Come on, sing...

41:08.248 --> 41:10.859
-He's not letting go.
-We got a call to move him.

41:12.121 --> 41:14.341
"We got a call."

41:15.385 --> 41:16.691
Who?

41:16.822 --> 41:17.823
What'd he say?

41:17.953 --> 41:20.303
I don't know. "Who," I think.

41:20.434 --> 41:22.349
I don't do statistical analysis.

41:22.480 --> 41:24.699
You also never set foot
in the Pit, did you?

41:24.830 --> 41:26.135
No, I didn't.

41:28.137 --> 41:29.617
Here.

41:29.748 --> 41:31.489
-His friend is dead.

41:54.337 --> 41:56.296
I have no further questions.

41:56.426 --> 41:58.211
Doctor...

41:58.341 --> 42:00.779
You were also the attending
physician for Pia Rivi,

42:00.909 --> 42:03.433
who was
the plaintiff's daughter.

42:03.564 --> 42:04.870
-Were you not?
I was.

42:05.000 --> 42:06.959
You sent her to the Pit?
-No, I didn't.

42:07.089 --> 42:09.135
Well, she was
pretty bad off, wasn't she?

42:09.265 --> 42:10.832
Her condition
rapidly deteriorated.

42:10.963 --> 42:13.443
Hmm. And from
her admitting forms,

42:13.574 --> 42:17.099
you were aware of the fact
that she was Latinx, yes?

42:17.230 --> 42:18.884
-I was aware of it.
-Well,

42:19.014 --> 42:20.712
given the slanderous accusations

42:20.842 --> 42:23.062
-made by opposing counsel...
-Objection.

42:23.192 --> 42:25.673
...why wasn't Miss Rivi
sent to the Pit?

42:29.590 --> 42:31.636
I'm not proud of saying this,
but...

42:32.854 --> 42:35.553
...we knew who her father was.

42:35.683 --> 42:37.859
Hmm.

42:37.990 --> 42:40.427
And knowing who he was,

42:40.558 --> 42:43.604
you knew he was a convicted
narcotics trafficker

42:43.735 --> 42:45.954
who had committed,
or ordered to be committed,

42:46.085 --> 42:47.869
-murder on multiple occasions.
Objection.

42:48.000 --> 42:49.871
Setting aside whether
it's true or not,

42:50.002 --> 42:52.526
the hospital staff
was aware of it?

42:52.657 --> 42:53.527
Yes.

42:53.658 --> 42:55.660
And did knowing that

42:55.790 --> 42:57.531
affect the kind of care
she received?

42:57.662 --> 43:01.796
She had a private room
and round-the-clock nurses.

43:03.145 --> 43:06.714
We did everything humanly
possible to keep her alive.

43:09.674 --> 43:13.286
We were terrified of what would
happen to us if we didn't.

43:14.592 --> 43:16.202
We're still terrified.

43:25.037 --> 43:26.516
Hey.

43:29.128 --> 43:30.695
Uh...

43:30.825 --> 43:32.087
When I was...

43:32.218 --> 43:37.440
Um, when I had COVID,
and I was in the Pit,

43:37.571 --> 43:41.444
I heard the nurses say they got
a call to get me out of there,

43:41.575 --> 43:43.098
out of the Pit.

43:43.229 --> 43:46.232
And that probably saved my life.

43:50.279 --> 43:51.541
Was that you?

43:55.545 --> 43:57.591
Jay, I'm...

43:57.722 --> 43:59.288
No, I mean, I'm...

43:59.419 --> 44:01.073
-I'm sorry. I...
-That-That's okay.

44:01.203 --> 44:02.857
That's okay. I...

44:02.988 --> 44:04.642
was just trying
to figure out who.

44:04.772 --> 44:06.905
I wish, I wish
that it had been me.

44:07.035 --> 44:09.211
But I-I just didn't know
how bad off you were.

44:09.342 --> 44:11.387
Me neither.

44:12.737 --> 44:14.260
Maybe it...

44:14.390 --> 44:16.088
it was your sisters.

44:16.218 --> 44:17.742
I mean, I think they knew.

44:17.872 --> 44:20.614
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, my sisters.

44:20.745 --> 44:22.572
Uh...

44:30.015 --> 44:32.191
This is quaint.

44:32.321 --> 44:35.585
I guess walls can be overrated,
in some situations.

44:35.716 --> 44:37.239
May I help you, Mr. Diaz?

44:37.370 --> 44:40.547
No. It's how I may help you.

44:40.678 --> 44:43.158
I'm calling Rivi
as my next witness.

44:43.289 --> 44:45.813
Mr. Rivi's testimony
has already been taken.

44:45.944 --> 44:47.119
Well, not by me.

44:47.249 --> 44:50.949
I'm no Counselor Glubman.

44:51.079 --> 44:52.777
There's always another option
for you, of course.

44:52.907 --> 44:53.995
Oh, yeah?

44:54.126 --> 44:55.780
What is that?

44:57.129 --> 44:58.391
Drop the case?

44:58.521 --> 44:59.697
No. No, no, no.

44:59.827 --> 45:01.481
We're willing to settle.

45:01.611 --> 45:05.093
I think I can get the hospital
to agree to a payout of, uh...

45:06.529 --> 45:08.140
Ten dollars.

45:10.882 --> 45:12.318
Call me by tomorrow.

45:27.202 --> 45:29.422
Yep.

45:29.552 --> 45:31.424
That's Racehorse's go-to.

45:31.554 --> 45:34.253
He'll, uh,
he'll get Rivi under oath,

45:34.383 --> 45:36.646
ask him about his businesses,

45:36.777 --> 45:38.300
try to get him
to incriminate himself.

45:38.431 --> 45:40.346
What should I do?
I don't want to lose this.

45:40.476 --> 45:42.130
Well, then you need
to tell your client

45:42.261 --> 45:43.218
the upside and the downside.

45:43.349 --> 45:45.438
This can only be his decision.

45:46.569 --> 45:48.136
Thanks.

45:55.404 --> 45:57.624
-Yes?

46:01.193 --> 46:03.021
I want to learn from you.

46:04.065 --> 46:05.153
I don't...

46:07.199 --> 46:09.810
My attitude is knowing.

46:09.941 --> 46:12.073
But it's, it's just my attitude.

46:12.204 --> 46:13.858
It's not who I am.

46:17.818 --> 46:19.167
Carmen.

46:20.560 --> 46:22.257
When I was your age,

46:22.388 --> 46:24.999
I acted exactly the same way.

46:25.130 --> 46:27.654
I wanted to be perfect.

46:27.785 --> 46:30.831
So, I acted like I was perfect.

46:31.919 --> 46:35.009
Because bluff is-is always
a part of it, but just...

46:36.881 --> 46:39.448
Just let me help you,
when I can.

46:41.581 --> 46:42.974
Ask questions.

46:46.891 --> 46:48.022
I will.

46:48.153 --> 46:49.328
Tell Rivi,

46:49.545 --> 46:51.591
it's his decision
whether to go forward or not.

46:51.721 --> 46:52.984
But...

46:53.114 --> 46:55.464
if Racehorse does depose him,

46:55.595 --> 46:57.379
we'll find a way to punish him.

46:57.510 --> 46:59.512
I like the sound of that.

47:00.818 --> 47:02.732
My guess is Rivi will, too.

47:09.739 --> 47:11.306
Señor Rivi.

47:11.437 --> 47:13.091
When was the last time
you saw your daughter

47:13.221 --> 47:14.744
prior to her hospitalization?

47:14.875 --> 47:17.443
In, uh, 2014.

47:17.573 --> 47:21.142
So, you hadn't seen her in
the six years before she died?

47:21.273 --> 47:22.840
We talked on the phone.

47:22.970 --> 47:24.145
Oh, that's nice. How often?

47:24.276 --> 47:26.060
Once a month.
-Mm.

47:26.191 --> 47:28.497
Well, I suppose "often"
is relative.

47:28.628 --> 47:31.022
How often do you talk
to your daughter, Racehorse?

47:31.152 --> 47:32.937
I'm not being deposed, Liz.

47:33.067 --> 47:35.548
Yes, but you just
made a comment about "often,"

47:35.678 --> 47:37.724
and I just,
I just want to compare it

47:37.855 --> 47:40.118
to, uh, the three times
that you've spoken

47:40.248 --> 47:42.598
to your daughter
in the past three years.

47:44.426 --> 47:45.993
You talked to my daughter?

47:46.124 --> 47:48.430
No, I just find that Instagram

47:48.561 --> 47:51.520
is a cornucopia of treasures
these days.

47:51.651 --> 47:53.871
Can I continue?

47:54.001 --> 47:56.656
I think the word you're
looking for is "May I?"

47:56.786 --> 47:59.050
-But sure, go ahead.
-Mr. Rivi,

47:59.180 --> 48:02.444
would it be fair
to describe your relationship

48:02.575 --> 48:05.752
with your daughter as strained?

48:05.883 --> 48:07.449
We loved each other.

48:07.580 --> 48:09.930
Yeah, we had issues.

48:10.061 --> 48:11.714
But, um...

48:11.845 --> 48:13.673
we were working through them.

48:13.803 --> 48:15.718
Well, did these
issues have anything

48:15.849 --> 48:18.199
to do with you being a murderer?

48:18.330 --> 48:21.028
Do not falsely
label my client. Carmen?

48:21.159 --> 48:22.377
His sentence was overturned.

48:22.508 --> 48:24.814
Apologies. <i>Señor Rivi,</i>

48:24.945 --> 48:27.600
what right do you have
to sue Harbor Hospital

48:27.730 --> 48:30.211
for pain and suffering,
when your own daughter

48:30.342 --> 48:31.909
-wanted nothing to do with you?
Okay, Racehorse.

48:32.039 --> 48:33.693
You're just creating
your own narrative here.

48:33.823 --> 48:35.913
For all your client's stated
concern about the treatment

48:36.043 --> 48:38.698
of Black and Latinx
people at Harbor Hospital,

48:38.828 --> 48:40.352
I wonder if it ever
occurred to him

48:40.482 --> 48:44.051
how many of them died from
the drugs he got rich peddling.

48:49.274 --> 48:51.624
Oh, so business isn't good?
I could imagine

48:51.754 --> 48:53.669
a prison stay
wouldn't be great for sales.

48:53.800 --> 48:56.934
Unless you had a trusted
number two at the helm.

48:57.064 --> 49:00.024
You're just sounding desperate,
Racehorse.

49:00.154 --> 49:02.678
It's funny, I actually have it
under good authority

49:02.809 --> 49:05.681
that business has never
been better for you.

49:05.812 --> 49:08.728
But you just got out, so...

49:10.034 --> 49:13.602
...who's been in charge
while you were gone?

49:24.352 --> 49:27.399
You're, you're going to have to
actually ask a question

49:27.529 --> 49:28.922
if you want to get an answer.

49:29.053 --> 49:32.099
No, I think Isabel knows
what I was asking.

49:32.230 --> 49:34.972
But I will repeat it
for the camera.

49:35.102 --> 49:36.930
I asked Mr. Rivi,

49:37.061 --> 49:40.194
was your wife in charge
of your drug empire?

49:40.325 --> 49:41.630
Objection! This has nothing...

49:41.761 --> 49:43.763
And is she, in fact,
still in charge?!

49:43.893 --> 49:45.460
-That's it!
-Ah.

49:45.591 --> 49:46.896
This is over!

49:48.681 --> 49:51.162
It's a good way
to get around FBI bugging.

49:51.292 --> 49:52.990
Have a wife who relies
on sign language.

49:55.122 --> 49:56.210
Oscar...

50:01.607 --> 50:03.261
We need security up here!

50:03.391 --> 50:05.567
-Security!
Oscar, no!

50:05.698 --> 50:07.656
Gentlemen, please!

50:07.787 --> 50:09.745

50:55.878 --> 50:57.663
You need to come clean
with the FBI.

50:57.793 --> 50:59.317
-What do you mean?
-I mean,

50:59.447 --> 51:01.797
you need to give the Feds
the names of all the people

51:01.928 --> 51:03.625
in your group, so that Kurt
doesn't take the fall,

51:03.756 --> 51:06.367
since he's done nothing wrong
to any of you.

51:08.848 --> 51:11.329
I haven't done
anything wrong either.

51:11.459 --> 51:13.113
Mm.

51:15.202 --> 51:17.335
"I'm more ambitious

51:17.465 --> 51:20.512
for a reputation
of personal courage."

51:20.642 --> 51:24.429
I recognized that phrase from
a video you shot for the NRA.

51:24.559 --> 51:26.039
Straight out of Churchill,
isn't it?

51:26.170 --> 51:27.562
What do you want?

51:27.693 --> 51:30.217
What I want
is for you not to exist.

51:30.348 --> 51:32.872
What I'll get is for you
to go to the Feds

51:33.002 --> 51:35.048
and clear my husband
of all these charges.

51:35.179 --> 51:37.398
I'm not guilty.
I didn't do anything.

51:37.529 --> 51:40.009
I don't give a fuck.
You wrote this manifesto.

51:40.140 --> 51:41.968
You're hiding the names
of your little gun group.

51:42.099 --> 51:44.101
And my husband is being
fucked over in the process.

51:44.231 --> 51:47.060
So, you tell the Feds
that he is innocent.

51:47.191 --> 51:49.062
I have to pick up my daughter.

51:49.193 --> 51:50.933
Yes, I know.
I checked you out online.

51:51.064 --> 51:54.633
I think it's strange that
a dedicated gun-rights advocate

51:54.763 --> 51:57.549
would have any issues
with being publicly tied

51:57.679 --> 51:59.594
to this little manifesto.

51:59.725 --> 52:01.292
But... Mm.

52:01.422 --> 52:04.773
I guess you're worried what
your Gymboree group might think.

52:04.904 --> 52:06.384
You have until tomorrow.

52:06.514 --> 52:09.996
After that, I'm telling
the FBI that it's you.

52:16.785 --> 52:19.136
-♪ <i>Round and round, the whe...</i>♪
-Shit!

52:21.181 --> 52:22.704
Diane...

52:22.835 --> 52:24.402
I need to ask you a question.

52:24.532 --> 52:26.099
Sure.

52:27.666 --> 52:30.147
When I was at the hospital,
a year ago,

52:30.277 --> 52:31.974
someone called for me.

52:32.105 --> 52:34.455
Uh, to get me
into a hospital room.

52:34.586 --> 52:36.414
Was that you?

52:36.544 --> 52:38.111
Was it me?

52:38.242 --> 52:41.288
Who got me out of an area
where patients were sent to die?

52:44.117 --> 52:45.510
I wish I could say yes, Jay.

52:45.640 --> 52:47.468
I didn't know
you were in trouble.

52:47.599 --> 52:50.079
I-I would've called.

52:50.210 --> 52:52.473
Why the fuck
aren't you asking me?

52:52.604 --> 52:54.867
I make calls all the time.

52:57.957 --> 52:59.959
What're you talking about?

53:00.089 --> 53:02.527
Well, think about it.

53:02.657 --> 53:05.791
I know everyone
at the Harbor Hospital board.

53:05.921 --> 53:07.314
I did half of their divorces

53:07.445 --> 53:09.534
and went to college
with the other half.

53:09.664 --> 53:12.928
I kept track of any
of our troops that got sick.

53:17.019 --> 53:18.804
You didn't really?

53:18.934 --> 53:20.414
-Did you?
-Of course I did.

53:20.545 --> 53:22.590
It takes a call
from someone like me.

53:22.721 --> 53:25.376
That's how you get
the best seat in the restaurant,

53:25.506 --> 53:27.291
or a hospital room.

53:28.814 --> 53:30.207
David.

53:30.337 --> 53:31.469
Thank you. I...

53:31.599 --> 53:34.298
Jay, it was a business decision.

53:34.428 --> 53:35.516
Forget it.

53:35.647 --> 53:37.257
The moment has passed.

53:41.740 --> 53:45.787
Does it mean less when
your patron is an asshole?

53:47.224 --> 53:49.095
I don't know.

53:49.226 --> 53:50.836
You're alive.

53:53.708 --> 53:55.188
I'm not.

54:02.456 --> 54:03.762
I'm sorry.

54:05.938 --> 54:07.809
I am, too.

54:14.120 --> 54:15.208
Thank you.

54:15.339 --> 54:16.905
I know the risk you're taking.

54:17.036 --> 54:18.864
That's great news.

54:20.082 --> 54:21.997
Again, thank you.

54:24.130 --> 54:25.479
Okay.

54:25.610 --> 54:27.394
Okay. Good.

54:31.355 --> 54:32.312
Want one?

54:34.488 --> 54:35.924
Good news?

54:36.882 --> 54:38.318
Julius was right.

54:38.449 --> 54:40.538
One of the other shooters
is coming forward

54:40.668 --> 54:42.540
to contradict Dylan Pike.

54:42.670 --> 54:45.456
Oh. That's great.

54:45.586 --> 54:47.022
Here.

54:47.153 --> 54:50.852
It's amazing how close
we came to disaster just then.

54:50.983 --> 54:53.377
It always is.

54:53.507 --> 54:55.509
You watch my back,
I'll watch yours.

54:55.640 --> 54:56.728
It's a deal.

55:10.611 --> 55:12.570

never come again.
