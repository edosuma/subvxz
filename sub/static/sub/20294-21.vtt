"COPS" IS FILMED ON LOCATION

00:33.267 --> 00:35.100
WITH THE MEN AND WOMEN
OF LAW ENFORCEMENT.

00:35.200 --> 00:37.667
ALL SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT
UNTIL PROVEN GUILTY

00:37.767 --> 00:39.700
IN A COURT OF LAW.

00:41.800 --> 00:43.033
-I LOVE WORKING GRAVEYARD.

00:43.133 --> 00:45.567
I FEEL LIKE THIS
IS THE BEST SHIFT,

00:45.667 --> 00:49.067
THE BEST TIME THAT WE CAN
MAKE A DIFFERENCE AS COPS

00:49.167 --> 00:52.000
BECAUSE THIS IS WHEN PEOPLE
ARE BREAKING INTO HOMES,

00:52.100 --> 00:53.733
STEALING CARS,
ROBBING PEOPLE.

00:53.833 --> 00:56.000
THIS IS WHEN ALL
THE IN-PROGRESS CRIMES
ARE HAPPENING,

00:56.100 --> 00:59.433
SO THIS IS OUR BEST CHANCE
TO CATCH THOSE PEOPLE THAT
ARE COMMITTING THOSE CRIMES.

00:59.533 --> 01:01.233
(radio chatter)

01:01.333 --> 01:04.300
SO, WE'RE TRYING TO
CATCH UP TO THIS CHASE.

01:04.400 --> 01:06.867
THIS DEPUTY'S CHASING
A CAR THAT'S FAILING
TO YIELD

01:06.967 --> 01:08.800
AND THEY'RE RIGHT UP
AHEAD OF US HERE.

01:08.900 --> 01:13.667
LOOKS LIKE WE'RE TAKING
38TH AVE. WHERE HE'S
SLOWING DOWN.

01:13.767 --> 01:15.533
TOOK 38TH.

01:15.633 --> 01:17.067
ATTEMPTING TO PIT HIM.

01:17.100 --> 01:18.900
PIT IS SUCCESSFUL.

01:23.600 --> 01:25.733
SWITCH THAT,
SHE'S CONTINUING TO GO.

01:25.833 --> 01:28.500
I AM NOW NUMBER ONE.

01:28.600 --> 01:31.233
(radio chatter)

01:31.333 --> 01:34.933
-WE JUST BLEW THE INTERSECTION
AT 152ND ON 38TH AVE.

01:37.467 --> 01:38.800
-(on radio)
PURSUIT, SOUTHBOUND 1-6.

01:38.900 --> 01:40.467
-STILL REFUSING TO STOP.

01:41.833 --> 01:43.100
STILL EASTBOUND.

01:43.200 --> 01:45.433
-GOING UP THE HILL THEN,
TOWARDS LAKE MILITARY?

01:45.533 --> 01:47.700
-CORRECT. LOOKS LIKE
SHE'S CUT HER LIGHTS.

01:47.800 --> 01:51.733
SHE, UH, SHE'S NOT REALLY
SURE WHAT SHE'S DOING.
LOOKS LIKE WE'RE TURNING

01:51.833 --> 01:53.500
UP-- SHE JUST CRASHED.

01:53.600 --> 01:56.100
TURNING UP
A LITTLE DIRT ROAD HERE.

01:56.200 --> 01:58.733
LOOKS LIKE--
I'M NOT SURE WHAT
THE DIRT ROAD IS.

01:58.833 --> 02:00.600
GOING TO THE TOP HERE.

02:02.200 --> 02:04.633
-TRY TO GET TO THE SCORES
ON THAT DIRT ROAD.

02:04.733 --> 02:06.800
-THAT DIRT ROAD
WE'VE HIT A GATE.

02:06.900 --> 02:08.867
WE'RE GOING UP.
WE'RE GONNA DEAD END
HERE IN A SEC.

02:08.967 --> 02:12.767
SHE'S GOING OFF ROAD HERE
INTO IT. SHE JUST--

02:12.867 --> 02:14.200
I THINK WE'RE GONNA BAIL HERE.

02:25.067 --> 02:26.300
GET ON THE GROUND!

02:26.400 --> 02:27.933
ON THE GROUND.
GET ON THE GROUND!

02:30.400 --> 02:31.667
-MY GLASSES...

02:31.767 --> 02:33.300
-HANDS BEHIND YOUR BACK.

02:33.400 --> 02:36.067
-MY GLASSES. I CAN'T SEE
WITHOUT THEM. THANK YOU.

02:36.133 --> 02:40.500
(sirens blaring)

02:40.600 --> 02:43.300
-SO, WE'RE GONNA CUFF
THIS LADY UP

02:43.400 --> 02:45.633
'CAUSE SHE DIDN'T WANT
TO STOP IN THE CHASE.

02:45.733 --> 02:47.933
I'M GUESSING
SHE MIGHT LIVE HERE.

02:51.333 --> 02:53.267
HEY, SHUT MY SIREN OFF!

02:53.367 --> 02:54.800
-LET'S GO.

02:54.900 --> 02:57.900
-OKAY. HANG ON, HANG ON.

02:58.067 --> 02:59.767
HANG ON. HANG ON.

02:59.867 --> 03:01.233
WHAT'S YOUR NAME?

03:01.333 --> 03:02.533
-YOU CAN TAKE ME TO JAIL.

03:02.633 --> 03:03.567
-THAT'S IT?

03:03.667 --> 03:05.367
-YOU CAN TAKE ME TO JAIL.

03:05.467 --> 03:07.200
-WELL, OBVIOUSLY WE'RE GOING
TO TAKE YOU TO JAIL.
-NO. YOU CAN TAKE ME TO JAIL.

03:07.300 --> 03:08.867
-WHAT'S YOUR NAME?
-I NEED TO SPEAK
TO AN ATTORNEY,

03:08.967 --> 03:10.800
YOU CANNOT TALK TO ME.
THANK YOU.

03:10.900 --> 03:11.867
TAKE ME TO JAIL.

03:11.967 --> 03:13.567
-DO YOU LIVE HERE?
-I DON'T LIVE HERE.

03:13.667 --> 03:14.933
-HOW COME
YOU DIDN'T WANT TO STOP?

03:15.067 --> 03:17.233
-HOW COME I DIDN'T
WANT TO STOP?
-YES.

03:17.333 --> 03:18.667
-I WILL NOT TELL YOU.
-OKAY.

03:18.767 --> 03:21.433
SO, I'M GUESSING YOU WANT US
TO IMPOUND YOUR DOG, TOO?

03:21.533 --> 03:23.067
RIGHT?

03:23.133 --> 03:26.200
-I WILL GIVE YOU MY NAME
IF I CAN PUT MY DOG UP.

03:26.300 --> 03:28.333
-UP WHERE?
-ON THE CHAIN.

03:28.433 --> 03:30.700
-NO. I CAN CALL SOMEBODY
AND HAVE THEM COME GET
YOUR DOG.

03:30.800 --> 03:32.733
-OH, YOU--
IT'S ALREADY HERE.

03:32.833 --> 03:34.267
-OKAY.

03:34.367 --> 03:36.133
-JUST TAKE ME.

03:36.233 --> 03:39.633
-REMEMBER, I GAVE YOU
THE OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE YOUR
DOG GO HOME WITH FAMILY, RIGHT?

03:39.733 --> 03:41.367
I'M GIVING YOU
EVERY OPPORTUNITY

03:41.467 --> 03:44.567
TO AVOID THE ANIMAL, ALL RIGHT?
-(whispers)

03:44.667 --> 03:46.600
(imitates barking)

03:46.700 --> 03:48.967
-YOU'RE GONNA SCARE
YOUR DOG. KNOCK IT OFF.

03:49.067 --> 03:51.700
SEE, NOW YOU GOT
THE OTHER DOG ALL RILED UP.

03:51.800 --> 03:53.433
-GOT THE OTHER DOG ALL--

03:55.867 --> 03:57.133
-WE'RE GOING INTO
THAT FLASHY CAR THERE.

03:57.233 --> 03:58.633
COME ON OVER HERE.
-THANK YOU.

04:00.900 --> 04:02.533
WOOF, WOOF, WOOF!

04:08.767 --> 04:09.867
-NO.

04:09.967 --> 04:11.300
-SHE JUST HAS HER PHONE
AND HER I.D. IN HER BRA.

04:11.400 --> 04:14.233
-MY-- OH, YEAH,

-THERE IS IS, HUH?

04:14.333 --> 04:15.567

04:15.667 --> 04:16.767
-ARE YOU GONNA
TELL ME YOUR NAME?

04:16.867 --> 04:18.600
-NO, SIR, I'M NOT.

04:18.700 --> 04:20.233

04:20.333 --> 04:21.933
-WELL, OBVIOUSLY I'M

-THANK YOU.

04:22.067 --> 04:23.767
WHY DO YOU KEEP SAYING THAT?
-TAKE ME TO JAIL.

04:23.867 --> 04:26.500
-ALL RIGHT. YOU KNOW
WE'RE GONNA TAKE THAT
I.D. OUT, RIGHT?

04:26.600 --> 04:29.367
-YOU CAN'T TOUCH ME!
THERE'S NOT A FEMALE
OFFICER ON HAND!

04:29.467 --> 04:31.667
-YOU CANNOT TOUCH ME!
-HE'S TOUCHING YOU.

04:31.767 --> 04:34.067
-LEGALLY, YOU CANNOT
DIG IN MY BREAST.

04:34.133 --> 04:35.600
-I DIDN'T SAY WE WERE
GONNA DIG IN YOUR BREAST.

04:35.700 --> 04:37.600
-YOU SAID YOU WERE GONNA
TAKE MY I.D. OUT. YOU CAN'T.

04:37.700 --> 04:38.767
-CORRECT. CORRECT.
-YOU CANNOT.

04:38.867 --> 04:40.133
THERE IS NOT
A WOMAN HERE.

04:40.233 --> 04:41.967
THERE IS NOT! THERE IS NOT!

04:42.067 --> 04:44.067
YOU HAVE TO HAVE
A FEMALE OFFICER HERE!

04:44.167 --> 04:45.433
-YOU ARE CORRECT ABOUT THAT.
-THANK YOU!

04:45.533 --> 04:47.633
I'M A DIABETIC
AND I HAVE HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE.

04:47.733 --> 04:49.500
-SO YOU WANT THE FIRE
DEPARTMENT TO COME CHECK ON YOU?

04:49.600 --> 04:51.067
-MY CUFFS HAVE TO BE
IN FRONT, THOUGH.

04:51.133 --> 04:52.300
-NO, THEY DON'T.
-THEY'RE TOO TIGHT.

04:52.400 --> 04:53.367
-DON'T TELL ME THE RULES.

04:53.467 --> 04:54.700
-WILL YOU FEEL THIS?
-NO.

04:58.800 --> 05:01.767
I'M GONNA LOOSEN THIS ONE
UP FOR A SEC, OKAY?

05:01.867 --> 05:02.833
BETTER?

05:02.933 --> 05:04.367
-IT'S STILL TOO TIGHT.

05:04.467 --> 05:07.133
-THEY ARE NOT-- LOOK,
I CAN PUT MY FINGER
ALL THE WAY THROUGH THEM.

05:07.233 --> 05:08.967
-IT'S STILL TOO TIGHT.
IT HURTS.
-IT'S NOT TOO TIGHT.

05:09.067 --> 05:11.200
-IT STILL HURTS.
-YEAH, THEY'RE GONNA HURT,
THEY'RE HANDCUFFS.

05:11.300 --> 05:13.067
-I FEEL LIKE I'M GONNA VOMIT.

05:13.133 --> 05:15.667
-WELL, DON'T VOMIT 'CAUSE...
WELL, IT'S NOT MY CAR,
GO AHEAD.

05:15.767 --> 05:18.400
ALL RIGHT, WELL, I'M GONNA CALL
THE FIRE DEPARTMENT OUT, OKAY?

05:19.500 --> 05:20.667
ALL RIGHT. HANG ON.

05:20.767 --> 05:22.300
-COULD YOU LOOSEN THESE?
-NOPE. NOPE.

05:22.400 --> 05:24.067
-THEY'RE LOOSE ENOUGH. NO.
-THEY'RE STILL TOO TIGHT.

05:24.133 --> 05:25.533
-THEY ARE NOT!
-THEY KEEP--

05:28.133 --> 05:29.933
-LOOKED LIKE SHE WAS GONNA
GO THROUGH THAT GATE,

05:30.067 --> 05:33.133
THEN AT THE LAST SECOND
CHANGED HER MIND
AND WENT DOWN THE HILL.

05:33.233 --> 05:37.300
AND THEN WHEN SHE GOT OUT HERE,
I DON'T KNOW IF SHE JUST STOPPED
OR THE CAR DIED,

05:37.400 --> 05:39.500
OR WHAT, BUT THERE'S
HER LICENSE PLATE THERE.

05:39.600 --> 05:40.900
WHEN SHE CAME DOWN.

05:41.067 --> 05:42.567
SHE GOT A DOG IN THE CAR.

05:42.667 --> 05:44.667
WELL, IT'S A GOOD THING
YOU DIDN'T RUN AWAY, HUH?

05:46.067 --> 05:47.067
HUH, BUD?

05:47.133 --> 05:48.833
YES, YOU'RE OKAY, HUH?

05:48.933 --> 05:50.533
THAT'S A NICE DOG.

05:50.633 --> 05:53.833
WHEN SHE CAME AROUND THE CORNER,
SHE WAS COMPLETELY OVER
IN THE ONCOMING LANE.

05:53.933 --> 05:57.067
SO WE GOT LUCKY THAT
THERE WAS NOBODY ELSE
COMING DOWN THAT ROAD.

05:57.167 --> 05:59.267
-(knocking)
-NO ANSWER?

05:59.367 --> 06:01.367
-NOPE. DOG'S BARKING
UP A STORM.

06:01.467 --> 06:03.067
-ALL RIGHT.

06:03.100 --> 06:04.967
I'M BACK, YVETTE.

06:05.067 --> 06:07.167
WHAT IS YOUR HUSBAND'S NAME
'CAUSE HE'S NOT ANSWERING
THE DOOR?

06:07.267 --> 06:09.600
-WESLEY.
-WESLEY. DOES HE
STILL LIVE HERE?

06:09.700 --> 06:10.833
-YES.

06:10.933 --> 06:13.767
-OKAY.
-CAN I JUST PUT MY DOG UP
ON THE CHAIN?

06:13.867 --> 06:17.400
WHAT DID YOU THINK WAS GONNA
HAPPEN IF YOU STOPPED
AND THE DOG WASN'T HERE?

06:17.500 --> 06:20.267
WE WERE GONNA IMPOUND
THE DOG TO THE POUND
OR SOMETHING?

06:20.367 --> 06:22.400
IS YOUR LICENSE SUSPENDED?

06:22.500 --> 06:24.167
YOU HAVE WARRANTS?

06:24.267 --> 06:26.500
THEN WHY WOULD
YOU ASSUME THAT...

06:26.600 --> 06:30.733
-BECAUSE I WOULD LIKE MY DOG
TO BE IN A PLACE WHERE
SHE FEELS COMFORTABLE.

06:30.833 --> 06:34.267
-WHY DID YOU THINK YOU WERE
GOING TO GO TO JAIL?

06:34.367 --> 06:37.867
-ALL RIGHT.
-MIGHT I BY CHANCE BE ABLE
TO HOOK THE DOG UP?

06:37.967 --> 06:40.167
-NOT RIGHT NOW, NO.

06:40.267 --> 06:43.433
-I WILL ANSWER MORE
OF YOUR QUESTIONS IF YOU
LET ME HOOK HER UP.

06:43.533 --> 06:45.167
-WELL, HOW DO I KNOW THAT?

06:45.267 --> 06:47.233
-I'LL SHAKE IT.

06:47.333 --> 06:50.500
-I GIVE YOU MY WORD.
I SHAKE IT, I GIVE YOU MY WORD.

06:50.600 --> 06:53.100
-THEY LET YOU KNOW THAT
YOU'RE GOING TO JAIL FOR
THE ELUDING, OBVIOUSLY, RIGHT?

06:53.200 --> 06:55.500
AND YOUR DOG
IS BEING TAKEN CARE OF.
ALL RIGHT.

06:59.200 --> 07:00.600
-IT CAN BE PRETTY SERIOUS
AT TIMES,

07:00.700 --> 07:03.667
BUT WHEN YOU GET TO WORK
WITH A GROUP OF GUYS
AND GALS

07:03.767 --> 07:06.633
WHERE YOU GUYS GET
TO KNOW EACH OTHER REAL WELL,

07:06.733 --> 07:08.767
HANG OUT AFTER WORK SOMETIMES.

07:08.867 --> 07:11.633
KINDA BUILDS A FAMILY
ENVIRONMENT AND IT'S NOT
REALLY WORK ANYMORE.

07:11.733 --> 07:14.467
IT'S MORE FUN
WHEN YOU COME TO WORK.

07:14.567 --> 07:18.567
SO, WE'RE COMING INTO
THIS COMMUNITY RIGHT HERE
TO SET UP A SAFETY CHECKPOINT.

07:18.667 --> 07:22.167
THEY'VE REQUESTED MORE
OF AN OFFICER PRESENCE
THROUGH OUR COMMUNITY MEETINGS,

07:22.267 --> 07:24.400
AND WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO
IS DO A CHECKPOINT TONIGHT

07:24.500 --> 07:27.167
AND JUST KINDA HELP
OUR OFFICER PRESENCE
IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD

07:27.267 --> 07:29.133
AND HELP THEM OUT
WITH THOSE ISSUES.

07:32.300 --> 07:34.067
THIS GUY JUST PULLED
UP TO THE CHECKPOINT.

07:34.167 --> 07:37.867
A LOT OF MOVEMENT INSIDE
THE CAR, I DON'T THINK HE'S
GONNA STICK AROUND TOO LONG.

07:37.967 --> 07:39.500
AND JUST SAW SOMETHING.

07:44.267 --> 07:46.067
(on radio)
-HE'S TAKING OFF.
HE'S TAKING OFF.

07:48.067 --> 07:50.633
(siren blares)

07:50.733 --> 07:53.267
-WE GOT HIS VEHICLE
NEARLY STRUCK A COUPLE
OF OUR OFFICERS.

07:53.367 --> 07:55.767
SO WE'RE GOING TO BE
IN PURSUIT OF HIM RIGHT NOW.

07:58.367 --> 08:00.067
10-50.

08:02.333 --> 08:03.833
WHOA!

08:06.067 --> 08:08.533
GET ON THE GROUND!
GET ON THE GROUND!

08:08.633 --> 08:10.867

08:10.967 --> 08:12.400
GET HIM, BOY!

08:18.367 --> 08:21.233
HEY, HE'S RUNNING
RIGHT THERE TO THE LEFT.

08:21.333 --> 08:23.167
CHRIS, STAY RIGHT THERE!

08:23.267 --> 08:25.067
BLACK MALE,
WHITE T-SHIRT.

08:28.833 --> 08:31.267
HEY, COME OUT TO ME
OR MY DOG'S GONNA GET YOU.
COME OUT HERE!

08:31.367 --> 08:32.800
(dog barks)

08:32.900 --> 08:34.867
ALL RIGHT, HOLD WHAT YOU
GOT RIGHT THERE, CHRIS,
DON'T MOVE TOO FAR.

08:34.967 --> 08:38.533
HEY, COME OUT HERE OR
THE DOG'S GONNA GET YOU.
YOU ARE SURROUNDED.

08:38.633 --> 08:39.733
-GET ON THE GROUND!

08:39.833 --> 08:41.267
GET ON THE GROUND NOW!

08:41.367 --> 08:42.933

08:43.067 --> 08:44.333
ALL THE WAY DOWN!

08:44.433 --> 08:45.833
NO, I'M GOOD.

08:45.933 --> 08:48.900
-(dog barking)

08:49.067 --> 08:51.233
-HEY, THEY GOT HIM.

08:54.567 --> 08:55.667
-WATCH THAT BAD MAN.

08:55.767 --> 08:56.767
-ARE YOU GOOD?

08:56.867 --> 08:59.500
-WATCH THAT BAD MAN.
-STAND UP. STAND UP.

08:59.600 --> 09:02.833
-HEY, YOU CAN WALK HIM OUT
STRAIGHT AHEAD OF YOU
RIGHT HERE TO THE RIGHT.

09:02.933 --> 09:04.133
-YEAH. WE GOTTA GET HIM
OUT OF HERE.

09:04.233 --> 09:06.833
-BUT THE FENCE IS WIDE
OPEN DOWN AT THE END.

09:06.933 --> 09:08.667
HEY, BROTHER,
NEXT TIME YOU RUN FROM US,

09:08.767 --> 09:10.133
MAKE SURE YOU TAKE
YOUR I.D. WITH YOU.

09:10.233 --> 09:12.300
WE STILL GOT YOUR I.D.
YOU LEFT IT WITH US.

09:12.400 --> 09:14.167
-WHAT WERE YOU SCARED OF?

09:14.267 --> 09:15.333
GOING TO JAIL?

09:15.433 --> 09:16.767
BUT WHAT HAPPENED?

09:16.867 --> 09:18.267
YOU'RE STILL GOING TO JAIL.

09:18.367 --> 09:20.567
SO WHY RUN? HUH?

09:20.667 --> 09:24.300
-WE GOT, JUST BASICALLY,
A DIME BAG OF WEED OUT OF
THE VEHICLE RIGHT NOW.

09:24.400 --> 09:27.133
THIS IS WHAT DEPUTY SALTERS SAW

09:27.233 --> 09:31.500
AS SOON AS THE GUY CAME UP
TO OUR CHECKPOINT BACK THERE.

09:31.600 --> 09:35.067
AND THEN HE TOOK OFF AS SOON
AS WE SPOTTED NARCOTICS
IN THERE.

09:36.800 --> 09:38.200
ALONG WITH AN OPEN
CONTAINER OF LIQUOR.

09:38.300 --> 09:41.533
SO, BOTH BAD THINGS TO HAVE
WHEN YOU'RE DRIVING AROUND.

09:41.633 --> 09:43.100
-WHAT'S YOUR FIRST NAME, BRO?
-RONALD.

09:43.200 --> 09:45.667
-RONALD, DID YOU REMEMBER
HANDING HIM
YOUR DRIVER'S LICENSE?

09:45.767 --> 09:48.467
-I REMEMBER HANDING 'EM OVER
AND HE ASKED ME TO PULL OVER,

09:48.567 --> 09:50.500
AND WHEN HE TOLD ME
TO PULL OVER, I WAS LIKE,

09:50.600 --> 09:53.300
"NO, I AIN'T GOT NO LICENSE."
YOU KNOW, WHAT AM I
GONNA DO?

09:53.400 --> 09:56.067
KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING?
SO RIGHT THEN
I JUST PANICKED

09:56.167 --> 09:58.100
AND JUST-- JUST PANICKED.

09:58.200 --> 10:00.733
I WAS JUST TRYING
TO GET AWAY, BASICALLY.

10:00.833 --> 10:02.300
-JUST OVER A DIME BAG?

10:02.400 --> 10:04.867
IS THAT WHY YOU PANICKED?
JUST THAT DIME BAG
YOU HAD IN THERE?

10:04.967 --> 10:07.267
GOT A LITTLE BIT
OF DAMAGE. IS THAT
YOUR DAD'S CAR?

10:07.367 --> 10:09.633
WHAT'S HE GONNA THINK
ABOUT THE FRONT END
BEING ALL BANGED UP?

10:09.733 --> 10:11.533
-I DIDN'T SEE IT, SO...
-YOU DIDN'T SEE IT?

10:11.633 --> 10:12.900
-I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S WHAT.
-ALL RIGHT.

10:13.000 --> 10:15.967
WE'LL GET IT TOWED OUT
OF HERE TONIGHT.

10:16.067 --> 10:18.467
I COULD HIT YOU
WITH A LOT OF FELONIES.

10:18.567 --> 10:20.933
-YES, SIR.
-ALL RIGHT, FOR THE ASSAULT
WITH A CAR

10:21.033 --> 10:22.800
'CAUSE WHEN THE DEPUTY'S OUT
AT THE CAR LIKE THAT

10:22.900 --> 10:24.467
AND YOU TAKE OFF
AND ALMOST HIT HIM
WITH THE CAR,

10:24.567 --> 10:25.567
THAT'S AN ASSAULT ON US.

10:25.667 --> 10:27.200
NOT GONNA CHARGE YOU
WITH THAT.

10:27.300 --> 10:29.300
ALL RIGHT? 'CAUSE YOU'RE
BEING COOL WITH US AND YOU'RE
TALKING TO US.

10:29.400 --> 10:30.967
YOU'RE GONNA GET
A FEW TRAFFIC CHARGES
ON YOU,

10:31.067 --> 10:32.667
AND THEN THAT POSSESSION
FOR THE WEED.

10:32.767 --> 10:34.333
BUT THAT'S GONNA BE
ABOUT IT.

10:34.433 --> 10:36.500
OKAY. SO YOU'RE GONNA GET
RECKLESS DRIVING,

10:36.600 --> 10:39.400
THE FAILURE TO STOP
FOR POLICE, THE PURSUIT,

10:39.500 --> 10:42.033
AND I'M GONNA HIT YOU WITH THAT
POSSESSION OF THAT WEED, OKAY?

10:42.133 --> 10:43.967
ALL YOU HAD TO DO
WAS PULL OFF TO THE SIDE,

10:44.067 --> 10:46.367
WE'D HAVE WROTE YOU
A COUPLE TICKETS, CALL
SOMEBODY TO GET YOUR CAR,

10:46.467 --> 10:48.033
AND YOU'D HAVE BEEN ON YOUR WAY.

10:48.133 --> 10:50.100
-I DIDN'T, YOU KNOW...
-INSTEAD OF GOING
TO THE JAIL.

10:50.200 --> 10:51.667
-YOU KNOW, I...

10:51.767 --> 10:54.067
WHEN A SITUATION LIKE THAT
HAPPENS, I PANIC, AND YOU KNOW,

10:54.167 --> 10:56.267
IT'S MY BAD.
IT'S MY MISTAKE.

10:56.367 --> 10:58.433
AND I'M GONNA MAN UP
AND ADMIT IT.

10:58.533 --> 11:00.800
-WELL, WE APPRECIATE IT, MAN.
WE'LL GET YOU TAKEN
CARE OF,

11:00.900 --> 11:03.067
WE'LL GET YOU DOWN
SO YOU CAN MAKE BOND COURT
IN THE MORNING, OKAY?

11:03.167 --> 11:04.500
-ALL RIGHT? OKAY.
-OKAY.

11:04.600 --> 11:06.233
-SIT TIGHT,
I'LL COME BACK
AND TALK WITH YOU...

11:06.333 --> 11:08.433
-YEAH.
-WHEN-- OKAY. ALL RIGHT.

11:09.567 --> 11:13.133
HE WAS GOING WAY TOO FAST
TO MAKE THAT CURVE, ENDED UP
IN THIS HOMEOWNER'S DRIVEWAY.

11:13.233 --> 11:17.300
HE HIT THE TRUCK. HE ALSO HIT
THIS KIA RIGHT HERE,

11:17.400 --> 11:19.700
AND THEN HE PUSHED THIS TRUCK
INTO THE HOUSE,

11:19.800 --> 11:22.600
AND INTO THIS NICE SS
THAT'S SITTING RIGHT HERE.

11:22.700 --> 11:25.333
MAN, I DON'T KNOW HOW BAD
THAT DAMAGE IS.

11:25.433 --> 11:27.600
-I THINK HE GOT MORE DAMAGE
ON THE BACK SIDE.

11:27.700 --> 11:29.367
-DID HE PUSH IT
INTO THE HOUSE?

11:29.467 --> 11:31.567
-HE PUSHED IT INTO THE GRILL
AND PUSHED IT INTO THE HOUSE.
-OH, MY GOD, DUDE.

11:31.667 --> 11:33.967
-SEE ALL THE BRICK?
-I DID NOT EVEN SEE THAT.

11:34.067 --> 11:37.767
SO, HE PUSHED IT BACK
AND IT CAVED THE BRICK WALL IN.

11:37.867 --> 11:39.533
YOU THE HOMEOWNER, SIR?
-YES, SIR.

11:39.633 --> 11:42.700
-WE WERE DOWN HERE TRYING
TO LOOK AT YOUR CAR

11:42.800 --> 11:45.367
AND WHEN WE GOT BACK HERE--
-OH, LORD.

11:45.467 --> 11:47.633
-IT GOT PUSHED INTO
YOUR WALL PRETTY BAD.

11:47.733 --> 11:49.900
I DON'T KNOW IF YOU CAN SEE
UNDERNEATH, SIR, RIGHT HERE.

11:50.067 --> 11:53.200
-YES.
-HE PUSHED IT BACK THERE
PRETTY BAD.

11:53.300 --> 11:54.867
WHAT'D YOU HEAR?

11:54.967 --> 11:58.267
-I WAS ASLEEP AND I THOUGHT
SOMETHING WAS GONNA COME
THROUGH THE HOUSE.

11:58.367 --> 12:00.433
SO, I JUMPED UP, AND...

12:00.533 --> 12:02.067
-MAN, SO, NOBODY GOT HURT?
ANYTHING LIKE THAT?

12:02.167 --> 12:03.667
-NO, SIR.
NOBODY GOT HURT.

12:03.767 --> 12:05.233
-WOW.

12:05.333 --> 12:07.667
-THESE GUYS JUST DON'T
THINK, MAN, WHEN THEY
TAKE OFF LIKE THAT.

12:07.767 --> 12:09.833
HEY, I WANT YOU TO SEE
YOUR DAD'S CAR.

12:09.933 --> 12:11.267
THE CHOICE YOU MADE TO TAKE OFF

12:11.367 --> 12:13.967
FOR THAT LITTLE DIME BAG
OF WEED, MAN, COULD'VE
KILLED SOMEBODY.

12:14.067 --> 12:15.900
THIS IS YOUR DAD'S CAR, RIGHT?

12:16.067 --> 12:18.833
YOUR DAD'S PROBABLY NOT GOING
TO BE HAPPY, BUT LOOK WHAT
YOU DID TO THIS GUY'S HOUSE.

12:18.933 --> 12:21.733
NOT ONLY DID YOU DAMAGE
THIS TRUCK, YOU HIT
HIS OTHER CAR.

12:21.833 --> 12:23.667
SO, YOUR ACTIONS

12:23.767 --> 12:27.267
HIT THAT TRUCK, PUSHED THIS CAR
INTO THIS HOUSE.

12:27.367 --> 12:29.700
I WANT YOU TO LOOK
AT WHAT YOU DID TO
THAT MAN'S HOUSE

12:29.800 --> 12:32.667
OVER RUNNING FROM
A LICENSE PROBLEM
AND A DIME BAG OF WEED.

12:32.767 --> 12:33.700
-IS HE IN THERE?

12:33.800 --> 12:35.300
-HE'S IN THERE.

12:35.400 --> 12:37.067
-LET ME APOLOGIZE.
-YOU WANNA APOLOGIZE?

12:37.100 --> 12:39.433
-YEAH, I WANNA APOLOGIZE
TO HIM, 'CAUSE I'M WRONG.

12:39.533 --> 12:42.633
-THIS IS THE HOMEOWNER WHO'S
CARS YOU JUST WRECKED INTO.

12:42.733 --> 12:43.700
-HOW YOU DOING?
-HOW YOU DOING?

12:43.800 --> 12:45.067
-I APOLOGIZE.

12:45.100 --> 12:47.167
YOU KNOW, I WAS WRONG.
YOU KNOW, I DIDN'T MEAN THAT.

12:47.267 --> 12:50.667
I DIDN'T EVEN MEAN TO EVEN
COME THIS WAY.

12:50.767 --> 12:54.400
BUT, YOU KNOW, ME PANICKING
AND MAKING MISTAKES,
BAD MISTAKES

12:54.500 --> 12:57.467
AND BAD CHOICES.
I MADE A BAD CHOICE
AND A BAD MISTAKE.

12:57.567 --> 12:58.667
I APOLOGIZE TO YOU.

12:58.767 --> 13:00.233
-I ACCEPT YOUR APOLOGY.

13:00.333 --> 13:02.700
-THIS RIGHT HERE LEADING
TO THIS, AND I'M SORRY
FOR THAT.

13:02.800 --> 13:04.467
-ALL RIGHT.

13:04.567 --> 13:06.100
-SIR?
-ALL RIGHT.

13:06.200 --> 13:08.833
-WE APPRECIATE YOUR TIME, SIR.
IF YOU NEED ANYTHING, ALL RIGHT?

13:08.933 --> 13:09.933
-BUT THANK YOU.
-OKAY. ALL RIGHT.

13:10.067 --> 13:11.067
-THANK YOU, BROTHER.
-ALL RIGHT.

13:11.100 --> 13:12.533
DON'T RUN FROM
THE COPS, MAN.

13:12.633 --> 13:14.900
THAT LITTLE DIME BAG
IS NOT WORTH ENDING
SOMEBODY'S LIFE OVER.

13:15.067 --> 13:17.267
LITTLE BIT OF PROPERTY DAMAGE,
BUT EVERYBODY'S SAFE,

13:17.367 --> 13:19.733
AND HE'S GOING TO JAIL.
THAT'S WHAT COUNTS.

13:22.067 --> 13:25.267
-BEEN A POLICE OFFICER
IN THE CITY OF CHELSEA NOW
FOR 26 YEARS.

13:25.367 --> 13:27.500
THERE'S A LOT OF ACTIVITY.
IT'S A VERY BUSY CITY.

13:27.600 --> 13:29.433
MULTI-CULTURAL CITY.
LOT OF DIFFERENT PEOPLE.

13:29.533 --> 13:31.067
WORKED IN
THE GANG UNIT, DRUGS.

13:31.133 --> 13:34.700
BUT MY FAVORITE FACET
OF THE JOB IS WORKING
UNIFORM PATROL.

13:34.800 --> 13:38.867
OKAY, LOOKS LIKE WE GOT TWO
PEOPLE FIGHTING IN THE BUSHES
DOWN HERE ON THE LEFT.

13:38.967 --> 13:41.933
YUP. RIGHT HERE.

13:42.067 --> 13:44.267
TROY, GET ME
SOME HELP. BROADWAY.

13:44.367 --> 13:45.800
EVERYBODY, BACK UP!

13:45.900 --> 13:47.267
MA'AM, STAY RIGHT THERE.
STAY RIGHT THERE.

13:47.367 --> 13:49.933
-OH, MY GOD, I WAS
WAVING YOU DOWN, CALLING
911, LOOK AT IT.

13:50.067 --> 13:52.767
HE-- THIS GIRL, I DON'T KNOW,
I GUESS SHE LOOKS LIKE ME, SHE--

13:52.867 --> 13:54.967
-NO, SHE TOOK MY MONEY,
SHE TRIED TO TAKE OFF WITH IT!

13:55.067 --> 13:56.600
-NO, I DIDN'T!
-MA'AM STEP OVER HERE.

13:56.700 --> 13:57.867
-GRABBED MY WALLET
OUT OF MY CAR!

13:57.967 --> 14:00.100
(all arguing)

14:00.200 --> 14:01.133
-DON'T MOVE.

14:01.233 --> 14:02.167
MA'AM, SIT RIGHT HERE.
-OKAY.

14:02.267 --> 14:03.567
-MA'AM, YOU HAVE
AN I.D. ON YOU?

14:03.667 --> 14:05.500
-I DON'T HA-- I LIVE RIGHT HERE
ON GROVE STREET, RIGHT THERE.

14:05.600 --> 14:07.667
I WAS WALKING UP THE STREET--
-JOE, STAY WITH HER.

14:07.767 --> 14:09.167
-WHEW.

14:09.267 --> 14:10.833
-SIR, STEP OVER HERE.

14:10.933 --> 14:13.400
(on radio)
-BROADWAY BEFORE MARLBOROUGH.
BROADWAY SIDE OF CITY HALL.

14:13.500 --> 14:15.533
-WHAT'S GOING ON?
-SHE SAID, "HEY,
GIVE ME A RIDE."

14:15.633 --> 14:16.833
I PULLED OVER,

14:16.933 --> 14:19.167
SHE ASKED ME TO GIVE
HER A RIDE,
-YEAH?

14:19.267 --> 14:21.067
-NEXT THING YOU KNOW,

14:21.133 --> 14:23.600
MY WALLET'S SITTING THERE,
SHE GRABBED IT, GOT OUT
OF THE CAR,

14:23.700 --> 14:25.200
AND WALKED AWAY.

14:25.300 --> 14:26.233
-ALL RIGHT.
-NO.

14:26.333 --> 14:27.633
-WAS THAT BEFORE
YOU UNZIPPED YOUR PANTS?

14:27.733 --> 14:30.233
-MY PANTS WERE UNZIPPED.

14:30.333 --> 14:31.900
-WHAT ARE YOU DOING
IN CHELSEA, TONIGHT, SIR?

14:32.067 --> 14:33.467
-I DROPPED MY FRIEND OFF
ON CENTRAL AVE.

14:33.567 --> 14:35.133
-SIR, I WANT YOU
TO HAVE A SEAT RIGHT HERE.

14:35.233 --> 14:36.667
WHERE DO YOU LIVE,
SHIRLEY STREET?

14:36.767 --> 14:39.533
-I LIVE ON
HUCKSTON AVENUE, WINTHROP.

14:39.633 --> 14:41.333
-ALL RIGHT, WHAT BRINGS YOU
TO CHELSEA, TONIGHT?

14:41.433 --> 14:42.533
-I WAS DROPPING MY FRIEND OFF.

14:42.633 --> 14:43.933
-WHAT STREET WERE YOU
DROPPING HIM OFF ON?

14:44.067 --> 14:45.967
-OFF OF CENTRAL.
DOWN BY THE TURN.

14:46.067 --> 14:48.700
-AND ARE YOU IN THE HABIT OF
PICKING UP GIRLS WALKING
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE STREET?

14:48.800 --> 14:50.267
-NO, SIR, SHE JUST SAID,
"HEY, I NEED A RIDE."

14:50.367 --> 14:51.967
AND I STOPPED.
-YOU PICKED HER UP?

14:52.067 --> 14:53.100
JUST TO GIVE HER A RIDE?

14:53.200 --> 14:54.633
-SOME STRANGER IN
THE MIDDLE OF CHELSEA?

14:54.733 --> 14:56.467
-I DON'T KNOW WHO SHE IS.
-I THINK YOU KNOW
WHO SHE WAS.

14:56.567 --> 14:59.067
-I THINK YOU KNOW EXACTLY
WHO YOU WERE PICKING UP.

14:59.133 --> 15:02.567
HAVE YOU EVER BEEN STOPPED
BEFORE FOR ANY VIOLATIONS
WITH THE JOHN LAW?

15:02.667 --> 15:04.333
-NO, SIR.
-NO, YOU DIDN'T THINK
SHE WAS A PROSTITUTE

15:04.433 --> 15:06.433
WHEN YOU PICKED HER UP
AND PUT HER IN YOUR CAR?

15:06.533 --> 15:07.800
AND YOU JUST PICK UP STRANGERS?

15:07.900 --> 15:09.533
IN THE MIDDLE OF CHELSEA,
YOU JUST PICK UP STRANGERS

15:09.633 --> 15:10.900
AT 1:00 IN THE MORNING?
-I USUALLY DON'T.

15:11.067 --> 15:12.200
I USUALLY DON'T, SIR.

15:12.300 --> 15:13.767
-ALL RIGHT, HAVE A SEAT
RIGHT THERE AND DON'T MOVE.

15:13.867 --> 15:15.800
ALL RIGHT, LISTEN,

15:15.900 --> 15:17.533
SO, HE SOLICITED YOU?

15:17.633 --> 15:19.800
-HE WAS TRYING TO SOLICIT ME.
I WAS SITTING HERE--
-WELL, WHAT DID HE SAY?

15:19.900 --> 15:21.667
-HE WAS LIKE, "HEY, HONEY,
I WANNA HAVE A GOOD TIME.

15:21.767 --> 15:23.600
"I HAD A FEW DRINKS,
I'M FEELING A NICE BUZZ.

15:23.700 --> 15:25.067
"WHAT'S GOING ON,
YOU WANNA HANG OUT?"

15:25.133 --> 15:26.867
"AND I WAS LIKE, "HEY,
WHERE DO YOU WANNA HANG OUT?"

15:26.967 --> 15:29.233
AND HE'S LIKE, "WELL, I WANNA
CROSS THE LINE OVER HERE

15:29.333 --> 15:32.067
'CAUSE I KNOW PEOPLE AROUND
HERE. I USED TO BUILD HOUSES,"
HE SAID.

15:32.167 --> 15:34.267
"SO I WANT TO CROSS THE LINE."
I WAS LIKE, "NO, I'M ALL RIGHT."

15:34.367 --> 15:35.800
AND THEN HE GOES,
"NO, YOU COME OVER HERE!"

15:35.900 --> 15:37.200
AND GOT OUT OF HIS CAR,
JUMPED OUT,

15:37.300 --> 15:39.100
HE WAS LIKE, "WEREN'T YOU
THAT GIRL--"
-YOU WERE IN THE CAR?

15:39.200 --> 15:42.167
-NO, NO, NO, I WAS TALKING
TO HIM. FROM THE-- LIKE,
RIGHT HERE FROM THE CURB.

15:42.267 --> 15:44.767
AND HE GOT OUT THE CAR
AND JUMPED OUT AND HE GOES,

15:44.867 --> 15:47.400
"WEREN'T YOU THAT GIRL, JESSICA
THAT RIPPED ME OFF LAST WEEK?"

15:47.500 --> 15:48.700
-AT WHAT POINT
DID YOU GRAB HIS WALLET?

15:48.800 --> 15:50.100
-I DIDN'T GRAB
HIS WALLET AT ALL.

15:50.200 --> 15:51.833
I DON'T HAVE HIS WALLET
AT ALL.

15:51.933 --> 15:53.233
I DIDN'T GRAB
HIS WALLET AT ALL.

15:53.333 --> 15:54.767
-WELL, HIS WALLET WAS
OVER HERE IN THE BUSHES.

15:54.867 --> 15:56.433
-AND HOW'D YOU GUYS
WIND UP FIGHTING
IN THE BUSHES?

15:56.533 --> 15:59.067
-HE WAS FIGHTING ME HERE.
HE GRABBED ME FROM ALL THE WAY
OVER HERE

15:59.167 --> 16:00.167
AND HE WAS FIGHTING ME.

16:00.267 --> 16:01.367
-DID HE OFFER YOU
MONEY FOR SEX?

16:01.467 --> 16:02.800
-HE DID OFFER ME MONEY FOR SEX.

16:02.900 --> 16:04.767
BUT HE WAS, LIKE,
KINDA BELLIGERENT.

16:04.867 --> 16:06.533
AND I WAS LIKE,
"NO THANK YOU."
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

16:06.633 --> 16:09.567
AND THEN HE WAS LIKE, "OH,
YOU'RE THAT (bleep) BITCH
JESSICA, COME HERE!"

16:09.667 --> 16:12.500
JUMPED OUT HIS CAR.
"MAN, I'M CALLING THE POLICE
ON YOU RIGHT NOW."

16:12.600 --> 16:14.233
-OKAY.
-I AM NOT JESSICA.

16:14.333 --> 16:16.633
-IS THERE A REASON THAT HIS
PANTS WERE UNZIPPED
AND YOUR PANTS WERE DOWN?

16:16.733 --> 16:18.500
-NO, MY PANTS WERE DOWN
BECAUSE HE'S PULLING THEM OFF.

16:18.600 --> 16:21.267
-OKAY. WAS HE PULLING THEM OFF,
OR WERE THEY JUST COMING OFF
WHEN YOU WERE FIGHTING?

16:21.367 --> 16:22.500
-NO, HE WAS PULLING THEM OFF.

16:22.600 --> 16:23.967
SAYING HE'S GONNA
STEAL ALL MY MONEY.

16:24.067 --> 16:25.467
-ALL RIGHT.
SIT RIGHT THERE.

16:25.567 --> 16:29.167
ALL RIGHT, SIR. SHE'S ALLEGING
THAT YOU SOLICITED HER
FOR SEX

16:29.267 --> 16:30.733
AND SAID THAT SHE HAD
ROBBED YOU LAST WEEK.

16:30.833 --> 16:32.133
-ROBBED ME LAST WEEK?

16:32.233 --> 16:33.900
I'D NEVER SEEN HER 'TIL
TONIGHT WHEN I PULLED
BY HERE.

16:34.067 --> 16:35.567
-SIR, AGAIN.
-JUST SAYING "I NEED A RIDE."

16:35.667 --> 16:37.967
HER STORY DOES NOT MATCH
ANYTHING THAT YOU'VE
TOLD ME TONIGHT.

16:38.067 --> 16:40.067
SO, I NEED YOU TO BE
AS HONEST AS POSSIBLE

16:40.133 --> 16:41.567
AND TELL ME
WHAT HAPPENED HERE TONIGHT.

16:42.967 --> 16:44.367
-DROPPED MY FRIEND OFF.

16:44.467 --> 16:48.067
DRIVING BACK TO ROUTE 16
TO GO HOME.

16:48.100 --> 16:49.800
I DON'T KNOW MY WAY
AROUND CHELSEA.

16:49.900 --> 16:51.667
SHE GOES,
"HEY, I NEED A RIDE."

16:51.767 --> 16:54.633
I'M A NICE GUY. I WORK WITH
SPECIAL NEEDS INDIVIDUALS.

16:54.733 --> 16:56.633
NEXT THING YOU KNOW,
I SAID, ALL RIGHT, PULL OVER,

16:56.733 --> 16:58.133
MY WALLET'S SITTING THERE,

16:58.233 --> 17:00.067
SHE REACHED IN THE CAR,
GRABBED IT,

17:00.167 --> 17:01.233
AND TOOK OFF
WITH MY MONEY.

17:01.333 --> 17:02.433
THAT'S IT.

17:02.533 --> 17:03.667
-IS THE CAR REGISTERED
TO YOU, SIR?

17:03.767 --> 17:04.867
-YES, SIR.
-ALL RIGHT, SIR.

17:04.967 --> 17:06.300
SEE IF WE CAN
SQUARE THIS AWAY.

17:09.833 --> 17:11.433
WHEN I FIRST GOT INTO
THE VEHICLE,

17:11.533 --> 17:14.333
ON THE FRONT DRIVER'S SEAT
THERE'S AN OPEN WRAPPER
FOR A CONDOM.

17:14.433 --> 17:16.133
THERE'S SOME MOUTH WASH
IN THE GLOVE BOX.

17:16.233 --> 17:20.067
THE FEMALE WE SPOKE TO HAS
ADMITTED SHE'S ENGAGED
IN PROSTITUTION BEFORE.

17:20.167 --> 17:21.967
THE MALE PARTY
HAD HIS ZIPPER DOWN,

17:22.067 --> 17:23.800
AND THE FEMALE PARTY'S
PANTS WERE DOWN

17:23.900 --> 17:25.967
AS THEY WERE FIGHTING
IN THE BUSHES WHEN WE
PULLED UP ON THEM.

17:26.067 --> 17:28.500
THERE'S A USED CONDOM
IN THE BACK SEAT.

17:28.600 --> 17:30.700
I THINK WE KNOW
WHAT'S GOING ON.

17:30.800 --> 17:32.533
MA'AM, TURN AROUND
AND PUT YOUR HANDS
BEHIND YOUR BACK.

17:32.633 --> 17:36.233
YOU'RE UNDER ARREST,
CHARGED WITH AN ARMED ROBBERY,
AND SOLICITATION PROSTITUTION.

17:36.333 --> 17:38.733
-BUT I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING
FOR SOLICITATION OR ROBBERY?

17:38.833 --> 17:41.167
-MA'AM, MA'AM,
FROM THE STATEMENTS
YOU'VE MADE TO ME,

17:41.267 --> 17:43.900
AND THE FACT THAT THIS
GENTLEMAN, AND HIS WALLET
WAS OVER THERE,

17:44.067 --> 17:45.067
AND THE STATEMENTS
HE'S MADE,

17:45.167 --> 17:46.500
YOU'RE BEING CHARGED
WITH AN ARMED ROBBERY.

17:46.600 --> 17:48.200
OKAY?
-ALL RIGHT.

17:50.067 --> 17:51.367
-STAND UP, PLEASE.
-YES, SIR.

17:51.467 --> 17:53.933
-YOU'RE UNDER ARREST,
CHARGED WITH ASSAULT
AND BATTERY,

17:54.067 --> 17:55.467
AND YOU'RE BEING
CHARGED WITH SOLICITATION.

17:55.567 --> 17:57.067
-MY BROTHER'S
A POLICE OFFICER.

17:57.100 --> 17:58.900
-EXCUSE ME?
-MY BROTHER'S A COP TOO, SIR.

17:59.067 --> 18:01.133
-HE IS? DOES HE KNOW
YOU'RE OVER HERE IN CHELSEA
PICKING UP GIRLS?

18:01.233 --> 18:02.200
-NO, SIR.

18:02.300 --> 18:04.200
-JUST PAT HIM DOWN, PLEASE.

18:05.900 --> 18:07.567
HOW LONG YOU BEEN
HOOKING FOR?
-TWO YEARS.

18:07.667 --> 18:09.067
-TWO YEARS.
-YEAH.

18:09.100 --> 18:10.800
-I NEED YOU
TO TELL ME EXACTLY
WHAT HIS PARTICIPATION WAS--

18:10.900 --> 18:14.233
-WELL, I ALREADY GOT ARRESTED
FOR SOLICITATION, SO LET
THE POLICE DEAL WITH IT.

18:14.333 --> 18:17.467
BUT HE PULLED ME, LIKE,

18:17.567 --> 18:19.667
I WAS SITTING RIGHT HERE,
AND HE WAS LIKE,
"HEY, BEAUTIFUL."

18:19.767 --> 18:21.633
LIKE, "I'M FEELING
NICE AND BUZZED."

18:21.733 --> 18:22.900
AND HIS PENIS WAS OUT
AND EVERYTHING.

18:23.067 --> 18:24.433
AND I DO--
-SO, WHAT? I'M SORRY, HIS WHAT?

18:24.533 --> 18:26.067
-NO, I'M NOT EVEN
TALKING TO YOU GUYS.

18:26.167 --> 18:28.433
(bleep) YOU GUYS ARE LIKE,
MAKING JOKES OUT OF THIS SHIT.
(bleep) THIS.

18:28.533 --> 18:29.867
-NO, NO, MA'AM,
I'M TRYING TO--

18:29.967 --> 18:30.967
'CAUSE HE'S PUT IT
ALL ON YOU.

18:31.067 --> 18:32.300
-I DON'T CARE.
-HE'S PUT IT ALL ON YOU.

18:32.400 --> 18:34.233
-HE WAS HITTING ME,
SO YOU GUYS SAW THAT.
-RIGHT.

18:34.333 --> 18:36.767
BUT YOU JUST TOLD ME SOMETHING
THAT YOU HADN'T TOLD ME BEFORE
ABOUT HIS PENIS BEING OUT.

18:36.867 --> 18:38.733
-WELL, BECAUSE I'M, LIKE,
EMBARRASSED, YOU KNOW
WHAT I MEAN?

18:38.833 --> 18:40.733
I DON'T WANNA-- HE WAS
TRYING TO DATE ME,
I ALREADY TOLD YOU.

18:40.833 --> 18:43.600
HE WAS TRYING TO DATE ME,
AND HE TOLD ME TO GO
ACROSS THE LINE.

18:43.700 --> 18:45.500
-RIGHT.
-AND I SAID, "NO,
I'M NOT GONNA DO IT."

18:45.600 --> 18:47.433
-AND YOU'RE TELLING ME
HIS PENIS WAS OUT
WHEN HE PULLED UP?

18:47.533 --> 18:48.467
-YEAH.
-ALL RIGHT.

18:48.567 --> 18:50.067
-THANK YOU.
-ALL RIGHT.

18:50.133 --> 18:51.167
HAVE A SEAT.

18:51.267 --> 18:52.800
-JUST SIT TIGHT
FOR A SECOND.

18:54.533 --> 18:57.433
-ALL RIGHT, SIR, SHE'S TELLING
ME THAT YOU SOLICITED FOR SEX,

18:57.533 --> 18:59.233
THAT YOU HAD YOUR PANTS
DOWN WITH YOUR PENIS OUT--

18:59.333 --> 19:01.767
-SIR, SHE TOOK MY WALLET
AND RAN AWAY WITH IT.

19:01.867 --> 19:04.667
-SHE TOOK YOUR WALLET
AFTER YOU SOLICITED HER
FOR SEX.

19:04.767 --> 19:06.867
-NO, I DIDN'T SOLICIT HER
FOR SEX!

19:06.967 --> 19:08.633
I DID NOT SOLICIT HER.

19:08.733 --> 19:11.167
-SO, SHE DIDN'T SOLICIT YOU
FOR SEX, BUT IN YOUR CAR YOU
GOT AN OPEN CONDOM,

19:11.267 --> 19:13.433
ALL RIGHT? YOU GOT THE WRAPPER
ON YOUR FRONT SEAT,

19:13.533 --> 19:15.333
YOU GOT THE MOUTHWASH
IN YOUR GLOVE BOX,

19:15.433 --> 19:18.433
YOU'RE IN CHELSEA AT 1:00
O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING.

19:18.533 --> 19:19.800
-SHE DROPPED STUFF
IN MY CAR!

19:19.900 --> 19:21.633
SHE GRABBED MY WALLET
AND DROPPED STUFF.

19:21.733 --> 19:24.367
-SHE GRABBED YOUR WALLET
AND THEN FRAMED YOU BY
PUTTING THAT STUFF IN YOUR CAR?

19:24.467 --> 19:26.233
-AND RAN UP THAT HILL.

19:26.333 --> 19:27.800
-I DON'T BELIEVE
YOU'RE BEING HONEST WITH US.

19:27.900 --> 19:30.067
AND THE CONDOM WRAPPER
DOESN'T BELONG TO YOU?
-NO!

19:30.100 --> 19:32.400
-THE CONDOM IN THE BACK SEAT
DOESN'T BELONG TO YOU?
-NO.

19:32.500 --> 19:34.733
-SHE JUST PUT THAT STUFF
IN THERE TO FRAME YOU?
-NO.

19:34.833 --> 19:36.533
-JUST IN CASE
THE POLICE CAME ALONG?

19:36.633 --> 19:38.633

19:41.333 --> 19:43.267
-I BELIEVE YOU'RE BEING
SOMEWHAT HONEST WITH ME.

19:43.367 --> 19:45.067
ALL RIGHT, YOU'RE UNDER ARREST.

19:45.167 --> 19:46.467
-YOU CAN'T HELP ME OUT
AT ALL, HUH?

19:46.567 --> 19:47.900
-NO, SIR.

19:49.067 --> 19:50.100
-Officer over radio:
132 AND BUSH.

19:50.200 --> 19:51.767
I'VE GOT HIM AT GUNPOINT.

19:51.867 --> 19:53.533
-Dispatcher:
OKAY, GUNPOINT, 132 AND BUSH.

19:53.633 --> 19:54.567

police radio chatter)

20:03.033 --> 20:04.967
