18:07.987 --> 18:09.408
That's exactly what I think, Roller.

18:09.444 --> 18:10.877
I'm getting my salon

18:10.912 --> 18:13.679
and I'm getting out from
underneath your family's thumb.

18:13.715 --> 18:17.183
You best believe that.
And you can't haunt me anymore.

18:17.218 --> 18:19.290

Hey, sugar.

18:40.675 --> 18:42.975
Polly, what the hell are you doing here?

18:43.011 --> 18:45.845
Sit down. I insist.

18:45.880 --> 18:48.581
Get the eff out of my house.
What is wrong with you?

18:48.616 --> 18:50.216
You know, it wouldn't take but a minute

18:50.251 --> 18:52.351
to peel a bitty thing like you.

18:52.387 --> 18:55.154
Now take a seat like a lady.

18:56.491 --> 18:58.424
Okay.

19:02.163 --> 19:06.766
Now, I hope you like vanilla frosting.

19:06.835 --> 19:08.100
It's organic.

19:08.136 --> 19:10.703
I'd like for you to tell me
why you're here.

19:10.738 --> 19:16.442
I have fantastic
‭perception skills, pretty baby.

19:16.477 --> 19:19.879
Your long-winded soliloquy
at the clinic,

19:19.914 --> 19:25.318
mixed with your general
inability to make eye contract

19:25.353 --> 19:28.721
plus your constant need
to embellish the details

19:28.756 --> 19:31.624
have made you very suspect.

19:31.659 --> 19:34.660
Why can't you just talk
like a normal person?

19:34.696 --> 19:35.992
See?

19:36.826 --> 19:41.367
You pretend to be a dumb-dumb
because it lets you hide.

19:41.402 --> 19:45.705
Yeah, but I know that
there are synapses firing off

19:45.740 --> 19:47.940
in that pretty little head of yours

19:47.976 --> 19:50.476
and you're smarter than we think.

19:50.511 --> 19:54.714
If whatever screwed-up thing
you did gets Desna in trouble,

19:54.749 --> 19:58.514

Good.

Now, eat up.

20:22.543 --> 20:24.744
Ooh, they're still warm from the oven.

20:25.041 --> 20:27.179
Be a shame if they got cold.

Mm-hmm.

20:51.272 --> 20:53.611
You scared me yesterday.

20:54.642 --> 20:56.142
Sorry, Des.

when we were younger.

21:00.682 --> 21:01.744
And...

21:03.151 --> 21:05.751
I look at this scar every day

21:05.787 --> 21:09.001
and remember that,
but we got to move on.

21:09.543 --> 21:11.123
Why... Why didn't you let me
draw the other testicle

21:11.159 --> 21:12.880
on their faces?

21:14.462 --> 21:16.495
I didn't want you to get arrested.

21:16.531 --> 21:19.470
Why... Why would I get arrested?
They're the criminals.

21:29.744 --> 21:30.710
No, no.

21:30.745 --> 21:32.211
- No, yes.
- No more exercises.

21:32.246 --> 21:34.280

21:34.315 --> 21:35.748
Dean, no, listen.

21:35.783 --> 21:37.283
It's gonna help you understand

21:37.318 --> 21:39.752
that the Coombses can't hurt us anymore.

21:41.122 --> 21:42.588
Come on.
