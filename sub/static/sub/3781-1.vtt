00:12.097 --> 00:15.533
- God, I'm going to come!
- Yes, please!

00:15.633 --> 00:17.543
Yes! Yes!

00:17.643 --> 00:19.644
Yes!

00:26.911 --> 00:30.689
Oh, God. That was amazing.

00:38.455 --> 00:40.089
What?

00:41.158 --> 00:44.060
There's an emergency at the office.
I have to go.

00:44.160 --> 00:46.115
You have to go?

00:46.215 --> 00:48.795
Yes. It's an emergency.
They need me right now.

00:48.895 --> 00:51.968
I'm so sorry. It's terrible, I know.

00:52.068 --> 00:55.438
Well, hey, I mean... Can I just,
you know, wait here for you?

00:56.740 --> 00:58.675
I don't think that's a very good idea.

00:58.775 --> 01:02.411
My daughter, Dara is coming home
any minute so you should probably...

01:02.551 --> 01:05.682
- Hey... this was great.
- Yeah.

01:05.782 --> 01:08.251
- I'll call you later.
- Sure.

02:15.515 --> 02:18.537
Elliot has acquired the top three percent
of high-end properties

02:18.637 --> 02:21.471
in L.A. in under five years.

02:22.453 --> 02:25.558
An achievement I would say
is quite remarkable.

02:26.058 --> 02:28.662
What they're offering us is salvation.

02:28.862 --> 02:31.797
An opportunity for us to all win.

02:31.997 --> 02:36.412
Either we take the deal
or we die a slow, painful death.

02:39.004 --> 02:43.273
- Well, I wouldn't say that.
- You have a better idea?

02:46.045 --> 02:48.545
I... I...

02:48.645 --> 02:52.219
It's a age old adage:
if you can't beat them, join them.

02:55.009 --> 02:58.742
If you have something to say, say it.
We're not mind readers.

03:04.062 --> 03:08.543
The ship's going down.
I would like to retire respectfully.

03:09.867 --> 03:12.202
I'll make that decision, Preston.

03:12.302 --> 03:13.836
Yes, of course.

03:13.936 --> 03:17.040
But I have to admit,
I'm inclined to agree.

03:17.140 --> 03:21.411
In the interim, I would like to know
exactly how many cents on the dollar.

03:21.511 --> 03:23.849
Crunch these numbers for me, Preston.
Get back to me right away.

03:24.314 --> 03:26.693
Absolutely. Gentlemen.

03:32.657 --> 03:36.658
You said you wanted to sit at the table
with the big kids. Well, now you're here.

03:36.758 --> 03:38.894
I know Dad, but I think
we can save this.

03:38.994 --> 03:41.713
Just remember something, honey.

03:41.813 --> 03:44.607
Pride comes before a fall.

03:46.435 --> 03:48.307
I believe in you.

04:33.980 --> 04:36.333
Hey, how was volleyball?

04:36.433 --> 04:39.036
Sucked. Coach Lombard is an asshole.

04:39.787 --> 04:41.472
I really don't like it when you swear.

04:41.572 --> 04:43.326
She acts like Monica is God's gift

04:43.426 --> 04:45.708
when Monica can't block
to save her fucking life.

04:45.808 --> 04:46.890
No.

04:47.743 --> 04:49.680
Mom, don't be so lame, okay? Come on.

04:49.780 --> 04:52.983
Are you kidding me? You're not an adult.
You can't drink. This is not good for you.

04:53.083 --> 04:55.852
- Oh, Plea... you drink.
- I'm an adult.

04:55.952 --> 04:57.408
Well, I'm an adult.

04:59.154 --> 05:01.099
Practically.

05:02.925 --> 05:07.531
Fine, I'll just get some old perv
to get it for me like normal.

05:08.031 --> 05:10.510
You know, that's not funny.

05:13.836 --> 05:16.172
Mom, what did you make me for dinner?

05:22.143 --> 05:24.232
Right over here.

05:34.055 --> 05:35.925
Thank you.

05:36.325 --> 05:40.880
So, can you at least pick a school
that you're not going to party at everyday?

05:43.330 --> 05:45.766
Mom, I'm not going to party everyday.

05:45.866 --> 05:49.784
I'll be playing volleyball six days a week.
I'll be too tired to party.

05:54.508 --> 05:59.650
A whole week without me,
looking at schools...

06:00.814 --> 06:03.350
I wanted to be a part of that.

06:03.450 --> 06:05.519
I'm sorry.

06:06.819 --> 06:09.788
Jessica's parents will be there
the whole time.

06:09.889 --> 06:13.959
I just... I don't want to rush this.

06:14.409 --> 06:16.320
You know,

06:16.978 --> 06:20.796
my dad told me where to go
and that's where I went.

06:20.966 --> 06:23.668
Well, I'm not you, Mom.

06:37.849 --> 06:40.448
I'll affect everything.

06:40.851 --> 06:43.365
Everything, Mom.

06:44.957 --> 06:47.894
Yeah, of course.

06:48.994 --> 06:50.880
Yeah.

06:51.930 --> 06:55.068
- You know what? I have my card now.
- Okay.

07:05.776 --> 07:08.357
You know what? Let's just go.

07:09.513 --> 07:12.187
No. Now. Stop that!

07:12.287 --> 07:15.951
- Mom, it's not a big deal.
- Yes, it is.

07:22.542 --> 07:26.891
- I can't believe I did that.
- God, yeah. Way to dine and dash, Mom.

07:26.991 --> 07:29.366
Hurry, please. I've got to go back there
and get my card.

07:29.466 --> 07:31.868
- Hang on for just a second, okay?
- Dara!

07:31.968 --> 07:34.461
- What?
- Go. Homework. Bed.

07:34.561 --> 07:36.438
Fine.

07:39.074 --> 07:41.133
Bye, Mom.

07:58.126 --> 08:02.231
- Oh, hi!
- Oh, hey. I got it right here.

08:02.331 --> 08:05.668
Great, thank you.
I am so sorry that I forgot to sign.

08:05.768 --> 08:07.179
It happens.

08:07.470 --> 08:09.526
I figured you weren't some kind
of degenerate.

08:11.773 --> 08:13.240
- Great.
- Thanks, sorry again.

08:13.340 --> 08:14.887
Hey. Don't go.

08:16.824 --> 08:20.080
- Sorry?
- Don't go.

08:21.946 --> 08:23.819
Excuse me?

08:24.119 --> 08:25.855
I want to talk to you.

08:27.305 --> 08:29.340
What would you want to talk about?

08:29.440 --> 08:32.549
Nothing too crazy. Yet.

08:33.977 --> 08:37.014
I don't even know what that means.

08:37.614 --> 08:39.067
Have a drink with me.

08:40.851 --> 08:44.871
You know what? I can't.
I just forgot my card. I've got to go.

08:44.971 --> 08:46.923
You are so beautiful.

08:48.792 --> 08:50.137
Ryan.

08:51.857 --> 08:55.398
Michelle. Nice to meet you,
but I really got to go.

08:55.498 --> 08:56.967
Have a cigarette with me.

08:57.693 --> 09:00.092
- I don't smoke.
- Yeah, you do.

09:06.608 --> 09:09.111
So, what do you do?

09:09.611 --> 09:11.680
Does it matter?

09:11.780 --> 09:16.171
Well, it does make
for polite conversation.

09:17.453 --> 09:19.954
I do various things.

09:20.622 --> 09:22.257
What do you do?

09:22.357 --> 09:25.248
That's an intriguing answer.

09:25.994 --> 09:29.360
I work in an office.

09:29.460 --> 09:31.471
I can tell.

09:40.908 --> 09:44.344
- I wouldn't know what to do.
- Just suck and blow.

09:58.558 --> 10:00.394
You okay?

10:00.973 --> 10:04.163
That's awful. Excuse me.

10:18.144 --> 10:22.449
You know, I don't...
make it a habit to...

10:22.870 --> 10:25.701
hook up with strangers.

10:31.424 --> 10:34.750
- You are old.
- True statement.

10:38.996 --> 10:41.556
Everyone's watching.

10:43.134 --> 10:45.700
Sorry. It's just... I can't. I can't...

10:45.800 --> 10:48.751
- What?
- I can't do this here.

10:51.443 --> 10:55.242
Okay, then we won't.

11:02.853 --> 11:04.690
It's just that I...

11:05.947 --> 11:08.893
I'm sorry I wasted your time.
It was nice meeting you.

11:08.993 --> 11:11.232
Michelle, hey.

11:11.629 --> 11:14.143
You didn't waste my time.

11:14.832 --> 11:17.378
I got the honor of meeting you.

11:26.710 --> 11:28.789
Call me.

11:59.040 --> 12:00.910
This morning, first ministers
meet for dinner,

12:01.010 --> 12:04.913
but disagree on exactly
what the prime minister put on the menu.

12:05.013 --> 12:06.590
And gearing up for another round

12:06.690 --> 12:09.985
in the battle over one of Canada's
oldest forests.

12:10.085 --> 12:11.652
Now the details. Bernie?

12:11.752 --> 12:13.788
Good Morning!

13:06.740 --> 13:10.813
Elliot's ROI in our wheel house
is going to suffer tremendously.

13:11.013 --> 13:15.291
In the short few years they've been involved
in residential and commercial properties

13:15.391 --> 13:18.584
they have suffered
a combined loss of nineteen percent.

13:18.884 --> 13:21.753
That's a sixty four million dollar
write down.

13:21.853 --> 13:26.940
The market will rise and when it does
that will be way more than 64 in the black.

13:27.040 --> 13:30.428
Over half of those properties are in Beverly
Hills and Brentwood, for Christ's sakes.

13:30.528 --> 13:32.001
Their properties aren't rising.

13:32.101 --> 13:35.361
With the exception of those on the Westside,
which are virtually bullet proof.

13:35.511 --> 13:38.169
And you discount everything
in West Hollywood?

13:38.269 --> 13:40.871
It's really going to hell
down there, isn't it?

13:40.971 --> 13:43.973
The only reason they are seeing returns

13:44.073 --> 13:46.910
is because their cash flow
is unaffected.

13:47.010 --> 13:51.316
Their current means of operation
is not sustainable.

13:51.416 --> 13:53.750
- It's going to hurt them.
- You're sure about that?

13:53.850 --> 13:58.309
I'm positive. Mulan properties is the
cornerstone of the Los Angeles Market.

13:58.409 --> 14:00.325
We've been here for forty years.

14:02.109 --> 14:04.353
I'm sure that I can provide a proposal

14:04.453 --> 14:10.374
that will show them that Mulan properties
is the valuable asset they deserve.

14:11.201 --> 14:14.160
Well, if you can do that,
we'll reevaluate.

14:14.260 --> 14:15.934
Until then I...

14:16.034 --> 14:19.575
I can't see any reason why they'd even
remotely want to keep us around.

14:19.675 --> 14:21.873
I second that.

14:22.078 --> 14:24.634
Thank you for your time, gentlemen.

14:42.063 --> 14:44.915
You do realize
that this company has lost

14:45.015 --> 14:48.871
over 100 million dollars
in the last two years.

14:51.438 --> 14:54.642
We're going to make
the money back and then some.

14:54.742 --> 14:56.212
I promise.

14:57.879 --> 15:01.995
The entire board votes to sell.

15:02.095 --> 15:04.123
You're the only one
that opposes, Michelle.

15:04.223 --> 15:08.122
Dad, Elliot's real estate investment
strategies, they're flawed, okay?

15:08.222 --> 15:11.525
If we merge we can help them.
We can save our company.

15:11.625 --> 15:13.545
We don't have to close our doors.

15:18.331 --> 15:20.346
Michelle, I love you,

15:21.046 --> 15:22.854
but if you're going to throw
a last second Hail Mary

15:22.954 --> 15:27.246
you better make sure Elliot
doesn't pull this deal off the table.

16:11.682 --> 16:13.819
- Hi.
- Hi.

16:13.919 --> 16:16.872
I'm... I'm so sorry
to drop by unannounced, but...

16:17.272 --> 16:19.724
you're a difficult person
to get a hold of these days.

16:19.824 --> 16:23.361
Yeah... works be kind of crazy.

16:23.461 --> 16:26.095
Yeah, I know,
so your assistant tells me.

16:27.264 --> 16:30.461
Well, I figured, you know,
because you've been working so hard

16:30.561 --> 16:34.837
you're probably too tired to cook
so I brought dinner.

16:35.340 --> 16:38.132
A little Chinese. I got your favorite.

16:38.232 --> 16:42.794
Steamed chicken with veggies and a whole
handful of duck sauce packets.

16:44.981 --> 16:46.992
Come on.

16:51.888 --> 16:54.924
How's Dara? Did she pick a school yet?

16:56.556 --> 16:58.297
She's looking.

16:58.397 --> 17:02.666
You know, I saw this when I was
at the store the other day.

17:02.766 --> 17:04.834
I thought it might help.

17:05.934 --> 17:10.204
Oh, wow, that's really thoughtful.

17:10.405 --> 17:11.540
- Yeah.
- Thank you.

17:11.641 --> 17:15.444
She's a wonderful kid. I mean, I'm sure
she's going to make the right choice.

17:15.544 --> 17:18.113
I hope so.

17:18.713 --> 17:22.704
You know, I've been thinking about us.

17:22.804 --> 17:24.347
About the future.

17:29.585 --> 17:32.339
I got you something.

17:35.296 --> 17:36.687
Go on, open it.

17:42.136 --> 17:44.407
Do you like them?

17:47.407 --> 17:50.983
Hey, what's wrong?

17:53.681 --> 17:57.652
I'm so sorry but I cannot except those.

17:57.752 --> 18:00.323
It wouldn't be right.

18:03.478 --> 18:04.824
Did you meet someone else?

18:04.924 --> 18:08.494
No, no, it's not that. It's...

18:09.292 --> 18:13.639
My company is going under.
I have a presentation to make.

18:13.739 --> 18:16.833
My daughter is going away to college.
I have a million things on my mind.

18:16.933 --> 18:20.677
Look, I know you've been stressed out
because of work and everything else.

18:20.777 --> 18:23.109
It's... I... I understand that.

18:23.209 --> 18:25.912
I thought it would be something
we could work through.

18:26.012 --> 18:29.282
I mean, I'm patient.
I want to be there for you.

18:31.282 --> 18:35.288
George, I don't feel
that way towards you.

18:37.288 --> 18:40.384
I don't have that spark, you know?

18:40.484 --> 18:43.773
Like that thing
that you're supposed to feel.

18:43.873 --> 18:48.744
That... that it thing.
I don't... I don't feel it.

18:52.371 --> 18:53.604
That sucks.

18:56.824 --> 18:59.010
I'm sorry.

19:07.084 --> 19:11.422
Look, I... I think
you just need some time.

19:12.122 --> 19:14.943
At least that's what I hope it is.

19:16.026 --> 19:18.071
I'm going to go.

19:24.224 --> 19:29.106
So I got your Hollywood and Pacific
Palisades reports and... your coffee.

19:29.206 --> 19:31.374
- Great, thank you.
- Yeah.

19:31.474 --> 19:33.478
Thank you.

19:34.478 --> 19:38.467
- Hey, any returns?
- No, sorry. I left two voicemails.

19:38.567 --> 19:41.918
Oh, okay. Well, keep calling back
every half hour.

19:42.418 --> 19:44.420
Will do.

19:44.520 --> 19:46.558
Alright, thanks.

20:18.151 --> 20:22.640
I have Jessie Aaron on the line,
senior portfolio manager from Elliot.

20:22.740 --> 20:24.750
Send it through.

20:26.461 --> 20:28.963
Mister Aaron, hi! Thanks for the return.

20:29.063 --> 20:33.369
I was going over our acquisition
and I think with your cash flow

20:33.469 --> 20:36.177
and our expertise we can make
both of our margins grow

20:36.277 --> 20:39.774
and I was wondering if you'd
be willing to meet face to face?

20:39.874 --> 20:42.776
Have lunch? Talk it out?

20:42.876 --> 20:45.246
The Four Seasons, yes.

20:46.146 --> 20:48.727
Two o'clock?

20:49.607 --> 20:53.880
Yes. Two at the Four.
Thank you. See you soon.

20:54.888 --> 20:57.124
We got a meeting!

20:57.224 --> 21:00.026
If we sell,
can I still be your assistant?

21:00.126 --> 21:03.015
Well, if we sell we're both
going to be out of a job.

21:05.031 --> 21:07.066
This is good.

21:11.169 --> 21:13.140
Hello?

21:14.075 --> 21:16.642
Have you changed your mind?

21:17.342 --> 21:20.881
Yeah, hi, Ryan.

21:21.681 --> 21:23.416
Bad time?

21:23.516 --> 21:25.351
No.

21:26.451 --> 21:30.631
I'm having lunch at a buddy's pad.
Why don't you join me?

21:47.271 --> 21:48.473
- Michelle?
- Hi.

21:48.573 --> 21:51.808
- How are you?
- Darrell, how are you?

21:51.908 --> 21:56.380
I'm good. I just wanted to say
how much I love my new condo.

21:56.480 --> 21:58.963
It's made a world of difference.

21:59.063 --> 22:01.676
It's changed my life.
Like night and day.

22:01.776 --> 22:04.422
- It's no problem. Anything for a friend.
- Thank you so much.

22:04.522 --> 22:06.991
- Yeah, it's good to see you. You look great!
- You too. You too.

22:07.091 --> 22:08.395
Good to see you!

22:11.995 --> 22:14.030
- Hi.
- Hi.

22:14.130 --> 22:16.333
- See you, later.
- See you, man.

22:17.935 --> 22:19.553
- How are you?
- Good. How are you?

22:19.653 --> 22:23.011
- Good.
- It's good to see you again.

22:24.537 --> 22:27.994
So I can only stay for a little bit, okay?
I have a meeting at two o'clock.

22:28.834 --> 22:31.096
And it's like half an hour drive away.

22:31.196 --> 22:33.216
Relax.

22:37.653 --> 22:39.780
Relaxing is not my strong suite.

22:39.880 --> 22:41.458
- I know.
- You know?

22:41.558 --> 22:44.626
- What's up, Ryan?
- What's up, Darrell? What's up, buddy?

22:44.726 --> 22:46.627
How do you two know each other?

22:47.695 --> 22:51.432
Well, we're new friends.

22:51.532 --> 22:55.013
Small world.
We got to hang out again, bro.

22:56.171 --> 22:59.444
That night has to be
relived and relived.

23:00.109 --> 23:02.101
Yeah...

23:02.678 --> 23:04.633
Okay, well...

23:04.733 --> 23:08.520
I'll leave you two alone.
I can take a hint.

23:08.749 --> 23:10.989
- Good to see you!
- You too.

23:11.089 --> 23:14.052
I honestly don't know what night
he's talking about.

23:15.255 --> 23:17.791
I don't drink in the afternoon.

23:19.645 --> 23:21.633
Yeah, you do.

23:25.733 --> 23:27.711
Okay.

23:27.811 --> 23:29.444
To new friends.

23:29.544 --> 23:31.837
To new friends.

23:36.676 --> 23:38.978
I've been wanting to talk to you.

23:39.078 --> 23:41.615
What did you want to talk about?

23:42.415 --> 23:44.033
Your fantasies.

23:45.524 --> 23:46.787
What are they?

23:46.887 --> 23:51.051
That's a very unusual question
to ask somebody you barely know.

23:53.726 --> 23:55.579
What makes you wet?

23:57.346 --> 24:01.733
I don't think anybody
has ever asked me that before.

24:01.833 --> 24:03.212
I just did.

24:07.273 --> 24:09.965
- I have to get this.
- Alright.

24:17.648 --> 24:22.119

24:22.819 --> 24:24.890
Thank you.

24:26.090 --> 24:27.223
I can't take that.

24:28.926 --> 24:30.800
- He's watching.
- No.

24:32.646 --> 24:34.598
I have to take this. It's my assistant.

24:34.698 --> 24:36.419
Alright.

24:37.567 --> 24:39.266
Hello?

24:45.008 --> 24:46.886
Right.

24:47.661 --> 24:50.137
We could change that.

24:51.415 --> 24:53.958
Can you call and maybe...

24:54.058 --> 24:57.061
push to tomorrow or...

25:00.457 --> 25:01.821
Something like that?

25:01.921 --> 25:04.703
I don't know. Just tell them there's
an emergency or something. I don't know.

25:04.803 --> 25:07.866
- Just tell them there's an emergency.
- I'm your emergency.

25:10.466 --> 25:12.968
Thank you, Lee.

25:13.268 --> 25:15.546
That was really stupid.

25:15.646 --> 25:17.713
That was really stupid.

25:17.813 --> 25:19.977
I should call him back.

25:20.077 --> 25:22.153
Let's get out of here.

25:30.952 --> 25:33.142
This is it.

25:33.242 --> 25:35.888
This is my office.

25:55.094 --> 25:56.942
Sit.

26:12.692 --> 26:15.496
You're so beautiful.

26:16.896 --> 26:18.763
Come here.

26:32.678 --> 26:34.755
Are you down?

26:36.182 --> 26:38.019
Yes.

26:40.419 --> 26:43.229
Where does your father sit?

26:44.991 --> 26:47.769
Take me to your father's office.

26:47.869 --> 26:49.893
Right now.

26:51.128 --> 26:52.939
Okay.

27:00.137 --> 27:02.211
This is it.

27:03.708 --> 27:06.255
This is Daddy's office.

27:07.746 --> 27:10.735
Please don't touch anything, though.

27:11.117 --> 27:12.880
Sit.

27:37.340 --> 27:40.160
You're a little daddy's girl.

27:40.862 --> 27:43.405
Working for your dad.

27:44.047 --> 27:48.581
Seeing him all day. Taking his orders.

27:52.922 --> 27:55.461
You just love your daddy.

27:57.861 --> 28:00.932
He gives you everything you want.

28:02.182 --> 28:04.904
You spoiled little brat.

28:08.937 --> 28:12.476
I bet your clit's hard
sitting in your father's chair.

28:14.376 --> 28:15.451
Touch it.

28:37.864 --> 28:40.980
Tell me about the first time
you touched yourself.

28:43.036 --> 28:45.073
Okay.

28:49.243 --> 28:51.079
I was at...

28:51.479 --> 28:54.491
a slumber party with my friends.

28:57.336 --> 28:59.428
I was little.

29:00.119 --> 29:02.745
We were watching a movie.

29:02.845 --> 29:06.386
It was a romantic movie,
but there was...

29:07.600 --> 29:09.379
a lot of kissing.

29:09.479 --> 29:11.898
And that made you wet?

29:11.998 --> 29:14.071
Yeah.

29:18.904 --> 29:20.941
And then what happened?

29:22.941 --> 29:25.327
And then...

29:27.780 --> 29:31.316
All the little girls went to sleep.

29:32.116 --> 29:33.985
And I was laying awake.

29:38.456 --> 29:42.744
Then I grabbed my pillow
and put it between my legs.

29:44.195 --> 29:47.717
You used a pillow? Not your fingers?

29:49.434 --> 29:51.754
I thought my fingers were too dirty.

31:18.453 --> 31:20.471
Oh, my God.

31:21.816 --> 31:23.843
Oh, my God.

31:37.371 --> 31:38.891
Put these on.

31:40.140 --> 31:42.133
Why?

31:43.877 --> 31:44.911
Whose are they?

31:45.011 --> 31:47.743
They belong to some dirty little slut.

31:47.843 --> 31:52.002
And that's what you are. So put them on.

32:01.728 --> 32:04.230
Stop questioning me.

32:04.830 --> 32:06.562
You'll need more training tomorrow.

32:07.533 --> 32:09.827
I can't.

32:10.880 --> 32:13.906
I can't. My dad has a... fundraiser

32:14.006 --> 32:19.011
and I have to give a business partner
a mea culpa for the meeting I missed.

32:20.311 --> 32:23.281
When we going? What time?

32:23.681 --> 32:25.584
You can't.

32:25.684 --> 32:27.774
You can't go.

32:28.386 --> 32:30.621
- Why are you so scared, Michelle?
- I'm not scared.

32:30.721 --> 32:33.526
He's not your daddy anymore.

32:34.326 --> 32:36.398
I'm your father.

32:38.862 --> 32:40.207
I'm your master,

32:41.289 --> 32:45.092
your husband and your god.

32:45.603 --> 32:47.265
I'm your daddy.

32:52.376 --> 32:54.608
Be afraid of me.

32:55.308 --> 32:58.158
Be afraid of what I'll do
if you don't obey me.

32:59.682 --> 33:01.152
Let me take you somewhere.

33:06.021 --> 33:09.529
- Where are we?
- You'll see.

33:13.629 --> 33:15.497
She's with you?

33:22.971 --> 33:26.074
Pay attention. That way you'll learn.

33:29.411 --> 33:33.081
- And they want this?
- Pain is pleasure.

33:49.530 --> 33:51.299
Are you okay?

33:52.399 --> 33:55.435
I'm okay. That was... that was
really intense.

33:55.535 --> 33:57.771
Yeah, that's what makes it fun.

34:05.145 --> 34:07.006
You're crazy.

34:08.815 --> 34:10.752
Crazy.

34:10.851 --> 34:12.886
My god.

34:16.456 --> 34:18.724
What turned you on in there?

34:20.060 --> 34:22.063
The girl with the whip.

34:24.197 --> 34:26.031
And the way she was treating...

34:26.130 --> 34:28.867
- Her sub?
- Her sub.

34:30.168 --> 34:33.176
It made my whole body clench.

34:37.943 --> 34:41.179
Whoa. Wait. He can see. He can see.

34:41.280 --> 34:43.297
Let him watch.

34:44.717 --> 34:47.918
Red. Red.

34:51.018 --> 34:53.757
Okay, fine.

34:53.858 --> 34:58.064
Let's go some place else.
Let's go to your house.

34:58.264 --> 35:01.767
No, my house is off limits.
My daughter's there.

35:02.867 --> 35:05.235
Let's go to my place.

35:51.914 --> 35:55.949
You're submissive and I'm dominant.

35:57.786 --> 36:00.355
You'll do what I say.

36:04.226 --> 36:05.771
Okay.

36:37.258 --> 36:38.785
Strip!

37:47.792 --> 37:50.327
I now own you.

37:54.198 --> 37:57.469
And when I'm finally finished
with you I'll fuck you.

37:57.569 --> 37:59.295
Do you understand?

38:01.072 --> 38:05.577
- Say, 'Yes Master'.
- Yes, Master.

39:26.653 --> 39:28.693
Oh, my god.

39:48.175 --> 39:50.217
Oh, my god.

40:22.675 --> 40:24.445
Ryan?

40:26.645 --> 40:29.546
- Ryan?
- Relax.

40:30.324 --> 40:33.423
- What are you doing?
- Don't hurt yourself.

40:53.603 --> 40:55.603
Did you like it?

40:56.105 --> 40:58.390
I liked it.

41:13.490 --> 41:16.026
That was so intense.

41:22.931 --> 41:25.469
So crazy.

41:26.769 --> 41:28.909
You know, I don't know
anything about you.

41:30.605 --> 41:32.675
What do you need to know?

41:33.176 --> 41:35.437
Your history.

41:36.389 --> 41:38.421
Where you're from.

41:40.815 --> 41:42.885
Why?

41:44.085 --> 41:47.661
Because that's what normal people
talk about.

41:52.561 --> 41:54.975
You don't want to tell me?

42:11.744 --> 42:13.884
Can you help me?

42:19.403 --> 42:22.722
- What did I tell you?
- What? I'm sorry.

42:22.822 --> 42:27.628
Oh, my god, I bet I have like ten
missed voicemails and nasty emails.

42:27.728 --> 42:30.130
Oh, my god. It's my dad.

42:30.330 --> 42:32.181
Fuck.

42:38.269 --> 42:40.111
Hello?

42:42.207 --> 42:44.273
Yeah.

42:45.943 --> 42:49.300
Yeah, I'm sorry.
Yes, I was on my way to the meeting.

42:49.400 --> 42:53.687
My phone died and then I got lost.
I was stranded.

42:54.387 --> 42:58.556
But I met this Good Samaritan
who let me charge my phone

42:58.656 --> 43:01.126
and I just now got all of the messages.

43:02.626 --> 43:06.790
Well, I'm sorry.
Can you just apologize for me?

43:06.890 --> 43:09.511
Tell them I'm sorry
and there's nothing I can do.

43:09.611 --> 43:11.437
My phone died.

43:11.737 --> 43:13.204
And my hands were tied.

43:15.806 --> 43:17.935
Tomorrow.

43:20.511 --> 43:23.897
Yes, I will be there.
One thousand percent.

43:24.097 --> 43:25.969
With three chargers.

43:28.319 --> 43:30.551
Yes, I'll be there.

43:31.722 --> 43:35.434
I will personally apologize
face to face to Jesse tomorrow.

43:38.561 --> 43:40.265
He hung up on me.

43:41.465 --> 43:47.036
He was really pissed off that I blew off
that investors meeting today...

43:47.136 --> 43:49.474
to hang out with you.

43:52.141 --> 43:55.216
There's just so much pressure.

43:56.277 --> 43:58.445
All the time.

43:59.348 --> 44:01.385
Don't worry.

44:02.150 --> 44:04.727
Just take it way.

44:10.326 --> 44:12.878
I like you, Michelle.

44:13.695 --> 44:16.798
You're not like a lot of these
stupid little girls I meet.

44:16.898 --> 44:18.903
I like you too.

44:21.103 --> 44:23.627
You're...

44:25.207 --> 44:27.881
different, to say the least.

44:44.792 --> 44:47.562
George? What are you doing here?

44:47.662 --> 44:49.764
I've been trying to get ahold of you.
Where have you been?

44:49.864 --> 44:53.834
George, you know it's not okay
to just come over unannounced.

44:55.051 --> 44:58.072
What happened to you? I mean,
I thought we had something here.

44:58.472 --> 45:01.708
- What?
- I'm seeing someone.

45:02.208 --> 45:04.610
- What? Who?
- That's not an appropriate question.

45:04.710 --> 45:07.900
- I mean...
- George, I need you to leave.

45:08.114 --> 45:09.695
But... Michelle...

45:09.795 --> 45:12.328
- I can't believe this is happening!
- George. George...

45:12.428 --> 45:14.684
- You need to go. I'm sorry.
- No, but... but... Tell me what...

45:14.784 --> 45:16.843
I'm sorry.

45:47.419 --> 45:49.509
Is that your daughter?

45:51.523 --> 45:55.391
Just turn off your phone for a bit.
Turn off your phone.

46:02.967 --> 46:04.446
I have something for you.

46:05.135 --> 46:09.072
- You got me a present?
- More like a toy.

46:15.277 --> 46:17.868
Put it in your underwear.

46:22.175 --> 46:24.027
Do it.

46:33.897 --> 46:37.398
When my father was in the late stages
of the disease it was...

46:37.498 --> 46:39.870
one of the scariest,
most hideous times of my life.

46:41.670 --> 46:44.239
Numerous friends were affected.

46:44.739 --> 46:46.968
Some of them passed.

46:47.568 --> 46:50.096
Some of them are still here with us.

46:50.196 --> 46:52.918
And some of them are
in this very room as I speak.

46:56.218 --> 47:00.522
Every one of us will know someone
connected to this disease.

47:01.723 --> 47:03.288
Relax.

47:03.388 --> 47:05.723
That's why I ask you, my friends...

47:12.934 --> 47:15.026
dig deep into your pockets.

47:16.137 --> 47:18.498
Please continue to help St. Francis

47:18.598 --> 47:22.591
in their battle to try to find a cure
for this grueling disease.

47:23.391 --> 47:25.434
Thank you.

47:33.219 --> 47:35.562
Come on.

47:52.139 --> 47:54.174
Hey.

48:02.548 --> 48:04.925
What are you doing to me?

48:10.489 --> 48:12.532
What is it?

48:13.359 --> 48:15.405
Put it on.

48:36.882 --> 48:38.977
Look at yourself.

48:40.251 --> 48:42.255
What do you see?

48:43.555 --> 48:45.189
What do you see?

48:46.489 --> 48:48.743
A messy whore.

48:48.843 --> 48:51.184
What do you see?

49:04.509 --> 49:07.945
- Now get out there.
- Wait... I can't.

49:08.045 --> 49:09.646
You're being rude to your guests.

49:09.746 --> 49:11.748
I can't go out there like this. Hold on.

49:12.048 --> 49:14.617
Leave it. Don't wipe it off.

49:15.417 --> 49:17.294
Go.

49:26.963 --> 49:28.412
Speak of the devil.

49:29.998 --> 49:32.402
- Hi.
- Were you two in the bathroom together?

49:32.602 --> 49:36.045
No. No, I was just fixing my makeup.

49:36.145 --> 49:39.292
Michelle, this is Jesse
from Elliot and Associates.

49:40.192 --> 49:44.796
- You're Michelle Milan?
- Jesse, it is so nice to meet you.

49:45.196 --> 49:47.233
I'm really sorry about the other day.

49:47.533 --> 49:50.368
It's fine. I like missing
my workouts to get blown off.

49:50.668 --> 49:52.773
I truly apologize.

49:53.372 --> 49:56.641
- And you are?
- None of your fucking business.

49:56.741 --> 49:59.043
And you're here because?

49:59.143 --> 50:01.988
Because it's a free fucking country.

50:05.651 --> 50:08.552
I would really like the opportunity
perhaps to sit down

50:08.652 --> 50:10.690
and maybe restructure...

50:13.390 --> 50:15.026
the terms of your agreement.

50:15.126 --> 50:19.529
- Now is not the time to discuss business.
- It's too late. What do you mean?

50:24.036 --> 50:28.637
What I mean is I think that a merger might
be more beneficial than an acquisition.

50:28.737 --> 50:31.262
Give me one good reason
why you think that Elliot

50:31.362 --> 50:33.470
would benefit from merging with Mulan.

50:34.711 --> 50:39.883
Mulan has a reputation
and a loyal clientele base.

50:40.383 --> 50:43.085
These are very valuable assets.

50:43.185 --> 50:46.856
Mulan Properties has lost over a hundred
million dollars in the last two years.

50:46.956 --> 50:48.791
Your company is falling apart.

50:48.891 --> 50:50.959
If you don't take deal
your company, your clients,

50:51.059 --> 50:54.931
and your reputation
will clearly crumble.

50:55.131 --> 50:57.832
Well, I could prove to you
with hard numbers

50:58.032 --> 51:00.138
that a merger would make you more money.

51:06.875 --> 51:10.146
- I'm okay.
- Michelle, are you drunk? What the hell?

51:10.246 --> 51:12.581
I'm going to give you one more chance
because of your father.

51:13.781 --> 51:15.822
He was good friends
with my father and...

51:15.922 --> 51:21.335
and he is the only reason why I would
even agree to think about his pitch.

51:21.435 --> 51:26.460
Besides, this son of a bitch right here
went to Wharton which is where I went,

51:26.560 --> 51:28.755
and he's been after me for years.

51:29.055 --> 51:30.971
Well...

51:31.371 --> 51:33.643
I'm sure that when you hear from me,
which will be very soon,

51:33.743 --> 51:36.704
I will have an offer
that you cannot refuse.

51:37.004 --> 51:40.006
You... you have a little
something there.

51:41.707 --> 51:44.415
I look forward to speaking
to you soon, Jesse.

51:44.515 --> 51:46.332
Sure.

51:49.715 --> 51:51.151
What is your problem?

51:51.251 --> 51:53.920
Don't talk to me like that.

51:54.020 --> 51:57.558
You could cost me my job.

51:58.158 --> 52:01.663
Admit it. You liked it.

52:15.775 --> 52:19.044
Oh, wow, Mom! You look hot!

52:20.078 --> 52:21.113
So?

52:21.613 --> 52:24.218
I want to go to Pepperdine.

52:25.318 --> 52:27.341
That's nice.

52:28.686 --> 52:30.488
- Are you drunk?
- No.

52:31.314 --> 52:33.636
- You are drunk!
- No, I'm not.

52:33.736 --> 52:36.962
I only had a couple of champagnes
at the benefit.

52:38.062 --> 52:43.235
Is that red lipstick? Oh, my god.
What happened to bore-me beige?

52:43.335 --> 52:47.125
Oh, my god. Oh, my god.
You've been kissing.

52:48.472 --> 52:50.976
- Yes, you have!
- No, no.

52:51.276 --> 52:55.539
Oh, god. Please tell me it wasn't
that douchebag, Preston, from the office.

52:55.639 --> 52:57.014
No. God, no!

52:57.814 --> 52:59.782
- Not George?
- No, George is gone.

52:59.882 --> 53:02.153
Oh, thank god.

53:02.486 --> 53:06.022
Tell me it's not some online
dating loser or something.

53:06.622 --> 53:09.426
I believe you date people
that you meet online.

53:09.526 --> 53:12.042
Yeah, but Mom, from middle-aged people

53:12.142 --> 53:15.252
to be trolling the internet
for sex is weird.

53:15.352 --> 53:19.301
- Middle-aged people.
- Oh, Mom. Come on.

53:19.401 --> 53:22.971
But people my age it's...
totally normal.

53:23.171 --> 53:26.778
- Are you sexually active?
- Are you?

53:32.281 --> 53:36.619
He must be pretty good.
He left you speechless.

53:40.423 --> 53:43.591
This is Mistress Alana
with spanking 101.

53:43.691 --> 53:45.928
Simple spanking is, in my opinion,

53:46.028 --> 53:49.691
the most effective way to introduce
erotic pain to a submissive.

53:49.791 --> 53:52.777
Start without any binding
at all to build trust.

53:52.877 --> 53:57.927
Then begin by lightly massaging
the buttocks.

53:59.374 --> 54:02.797
We actually have a safe word too.
If a good dominant knows anything,

54:02.897 --> 54:07.181
it's the importance of safety
and consent.

54:07.281 --> 54:10.702
Okay, so... keep your hand cupped,
fingers together,

54:10.802 --> 54:14.288
and remember to aim for the lower,
fleshy part of the buttocks.

54:15.488 --> 54:17.625
Just like that.

54:19.360 --> 54:21.537
And twelve more

54:21.637 --> 54:25.433
just... like... that.

54:32.372 --> 54:36.242
Okay, and then sign it Yours Truly,
yada yada yada...

54:36.342 --> 54:38.177
Yada yada yada... And done and done.

54:38.277 --> 54:40.646
Thank you, babe.

54:48.455 --> 54:51.961
- Hi.
- Have a seat, please.

54:54.461 --> 54:56.152
Preston brought me up to speed.

54:56.886 --> 55:00.196
I am also aware of the fact that you
blew off your meeting with Jesse.

55:00.296 --> 55:02.680
Smooth, Michelle. Real smooth.

55:05.736 --> 55:07.907
I'm sorry about my behavior lately, Dad.

55:08.675 --> 55:12.502
Ryan Black. Really, Chelle?

55:12.602 --> 55:15.495
A drug dealing car thief
in front of our colleagues?

55:16.095 --> 55:18.481
What were you thinking?

55:21.285 --> 55:23.488
I'm sorry.

55:25.923 --> 55:32.280
I am so sick and tired of hearing those
words come out of your lips, Michelle.

55:32.380 --> 55:34.432
I really am.

55:35.532 --> 55:40.128
You had sex with someone in the bathroom

55:40.428 --> 55:42.505
at the Alzheimer's fund raiser.

55:42.605 --> 55:44.930
Do you have any idea how embarrassing,

55:45.030 --> 55:48.731
in front of people that I have
depended on to raise millions of dollars

55:48.831 --> 55:51.464
for St. Francis for many, many years.

55:51.964 --> 55:54.625
Your disgraceful
and reprehensible behavior

55:54.725 --> 55:58.120
is a reflection
on our family's good name.

55:58.220 --> 56:03.675
I promise you I will never let my personal
life interfere with my work again.

56:03.775 --> 56:09.637
You have my word. I am 100%
dedicated to this company.

56:16.437 --> 56:21.043
Your professional life should never
involve commoners, Michelle.

56:21.843 --> 56:24.280
Note to self.

56:25.380 --> 56:27.342
Moving on...

56:29.101 --> 56:32.021
this deal with Jesse, it's a big one.

56:32.121 --> 56:35.223
Our entire family's legacy
depends on it.

56:35.323 --> 56:38.138
No, I know. Listen...

56:39.296 --> 56:41.329
I've been doing a lot of analysis

56:41.429 --> 56:45.222
and the way Elliot has been structuring
their real estate investment deals

56:46.022 --> 56:50.280
and the locations that they're picking,
and I think with our expertise...

56:51.581 --> 56:53.940
You know, we don't have
the capital they have

56:54.040 --> 56:57.612
so if we could just get them to purchase
where we can't purchase

56:57.712 --> 57:02.704
then I think our expertise and their capital,
we can make something work.

57:02.804 --> 57:04.773
You know, we don't have to...

57:04.873 --> 57:08.663
be acquired we can do a merger
and we can run their real estate division

57:08.763 --> 57:12.110
and make them tons of money and
I think they're really going to go for it.

57:12.210 --> 57:14.535
I think they really will go for it.

57:14.635 --> 57:17.924
I just... I just need a little bit more
time to work on the projections

57:18.024 --> 57:20.517
and it's there. It's there.

57:20.617 --> 57:22.650
Michelle...

57:23.050 --> 57:25.208
you're not ready.

57:25.308 --> 57:28.785
I am inclined to sell.

57:29.141 --> 57:32.929
Against my chief officer's
financial advice

57:33.029 --> 57:36.382
I am going to give you a window.

57:36.482 --> 57:39.853
A very short window, Michelle.

57:39.953 --> 57:43.407
And only because you're my daughter
and I love you.

57:44.690 --> 57:46.862
Don't fuck it up.

57:47.990 --> 57:50.194
Now go.

57:50.294 --> 57:52.332
Okay.

57:59.605 --> 58:03.891
No... I'm calling to get
the sale price. Yeah.

58:03.991 --> 58:06.756
Well, I understand that the sale price
is not available to the public

58:06.856 --> 58:08.846
but I'm not the public. I'm a realtor.

58:09.446 --> 58:10.875
Everything is for sale.

58:10.975 --> 58:15.885
Listen, maybe we got off on the wrong foot.
Okay, let's try this again.

58:15.985 --> 58:19.990
What if I have messengered over
a thousand-dollar check?

58:20.090 --> 58:23.626
Do you think then you could
dig up the sale price for me?

58:26.764 --> 58:28.797
Unbelievable.

58:55.992 --> 58:58.000
I've got it.

59:00.430 --> 59:02.351
I've got it.

59:17.679 --> 59:21.335
Yes, hello this is Michelle Mulan
for Peter Sonders.

59:21.435 --> 59:25.224
I see. Well, I'm sure he could call me back
but I think he's going to want to hear

59:25.324 --> 59:28.923
what I have to say
about the Pacific Design Center.

59:29.923 --> 59:33.928
Yeah, I'd rather not leave a message
and have him call me back.

59:34.028 --> 59:38.198
No, and I think he'd be really disappointed
if he found out that you left me holding,

59:38.298 --> 59:42.237
especially considering I can probably
make him about a billion dollars right now.

59:44.537 --> 59:48.126
Paul, hi.

59:48.959 --> 59:54.115
Yes, I have some
very intriguing news for you.

01:02:07.175 --> 01:02:09.911
Have you ever been a submissive?

01:02:11.311 --> 01:02:13.351
Maybe.

01:02:16.551 --> 01:02:18.947
Can I spank you?

01:02:20.420 --> 01:02:22.356
No.

01:02:23.756 --> 01:02:28.097
No, you don't want to be spanked
or no, you don't want to be spanked by me?

01:02:30.497 --> 01:02:34.006
Is that what happened in the restaurant
that day with Alana?

01:02:35.068 --> 01:02:37.179
She's a psychopath.

01:02:37.279 --> 01:02:40.164
Whatever she tells you is lies.

01:02:43.409 --> 01:02:47.281
Well, I've never met her.
She didn't tell me anything.

01:02:47.381 --> 01:02:50.349
I did see her in a video though.

01:02:51.349 --> 01:02:54.235
You've been researching on your own.

01:02:55.120 --> 01:02:57.491
Is that where this is coming from?

01:03:02.527 --> 01:03:04.800
This is my world.

01:03:07.700 --> 01:03:10.572
You're not ready for it.

01:03:10.672 --> 01:03:13.047
Far from it.

01:03:14.304 --> 01:03:17.826
You should say thank you,
Master and that's all.

01:03:20.511 --> 01:03:23.400
Thank you, Master.

01:03:36.961 --> 01:03:40.003
I still want to try it though.

01:03:45.903 --> 01:03:47.375
Leave.

01:03:50.975 --> 01:03:52.221
- Get out, now.
- What?

01:03:54.077 --> 01:03:56.212
- Get the fuck out, now!
- Jesus.

01:04:11.127 --> 01:04:13.862
That's a beauty. Genuine brocade.

01:04:14.162 --> 01:04:18.467
You would have subs lined up around
the block. Would you like to try it on?

01:04:19.167 --> 01:04:22.571
Oh, are they actually for sale?
Or are they just samples?

01:04:22.671 --> 01:04:25.741
No, of course they're for sale.
You can't get stuff like this at the mall.

01:04:27.741 --> 01:04:30.111
How do you know what size to get?

01:04:38.320 --> 01:04:40.354
You're Ryan's friend?

01:04:54.035 --> 01:04:56.358
Do you want to pet my puppy?

01:04:57.303 --> 01:05:00.210
You're Ryan's sub.

01:05:00.941 --> 01:05:02.477
Yes, Mistress.

01:05:03.977 --> 01:05:07.314
You don't have to call me that.
Not unless you want to.

01:05:07.614 --> 01:05:10.001
What's your name?

01:05:10.585 --> 01:05:12.053
Michelle.

01:05:12.153 --> 01:05:13.855
Sit, puppy!

01:05:14.855 --> 01:05:17.291
Good girl.

01:05:19.191 --> 01:05:21.227
It's called puppy play.

01:05:21.327 --> 01:05:24.831
- And she likes this?
- Ask her.

01:05:25.631 --> 01:05:27.004
You like this?

01:05:29.002 --> 01:05:31.763
Stay puppy.

01:05:34.641 --> 01:05:37.443
Can I give you some advice, Michelle?

01:05:37.543 --> 01:05:40.045
Be careful with Ryan.

01:05:40.622 --> 01:05:42.817
He's dangerous.

01:05:42.917 --> 01:05:46.486
He hurts people. Not just
their bodies but their lives.

01:05:46.986 --> 01:05:49.562
He gets off on it.

01:05:50.289 --> 01:05:51.720
Why should I believe you?

01:05:53.549 --> 01:05:58.566
Don't. I just thought someone
should warn you to watch out.

01:06:00.666 --> 01:06:02.301
Why do you care?

01:06:03.183 --> 01:06:08.406
Because people like Ryan
give people like us a bad name.

01:06:08.506 --> 01:06:13.710
These are loving, creative,
smart people here.

01:06:13.810 --> 01:06:16.295
And Ryan is a predator.

01:06:17.381 --> 01:06:20.952
So what does that make me? The victim?

01:06:22.252 --> 01:06:24.715
You're feisty.

01:06:24.815 --> 01:06:28.305
Looks to me like you've been
on the wrong side of the whip.

01:06:29.159 --> 01:06:32.707
Stay where you are puppy.
Come, follow me.

01:06:45.307 --> 01:06:48.412
Would you like to help administer
some medicine to the patient?

01:06:48.812 --> 01:06:51.879
I think we'd all love
to see a scene with you.

01:06:53.750 --> 01:06:56.352
I wouldn't know what to do.

01:06:56.452 --> 01:07:00.155
Oh, our patient is more than happy
to help train a student.

01:07:00.655 --> 01:07:03.024
Do you want to play?

01:07:27.759 --> 01:07:30.109
Good job.

01:08:22.734 --> 01:08:23.970
Oh, my god.

01:08:24.069 --> 01:08:25.970
Oh, my god. I thought
you were working all night.

01:08:26.071 --> 01:08:28.475
Get away from my daughter!

01:08:29.475 --> 01:08:32.810
- Why would you go after her, Ryan?
- Wait, you know each other?

01:08:34.180 --> 01:08:36.747
Your daughter is a really
naughty girl, Michelle.

01:08:36.848 --> 01:08:38.049
I'll fucking kill you!

01:08:38.149 --> 01:08:39.550
- I can't get out of these!
- Okay.

01:08:39.649 --> 01:08:42.470
- You can't even untie those knots.
- Get me out of these!

01:08:42.569 --> 01:08:45.488
I will call the police.
They will throw the key away.

01:08:45.788 --> 01:08:50.127
For what? For meeting a girl
and not having sex with her?

01:08:50.228 --> 01:08:51.629
Shut up!

01:08:52.129 --> 01:08:55.385
Your daughter really looks like you.

01:08:55.484 --> 01:08:57.996
I would love to see you two kiss.

01:08:58.095 --> 01:08:59.036
I will kill you.

01:08:59.236 --> 01:09:01.470
I am your master!

01:09:01.571 --> 01:09:04.142
Don't fucking forget it!

01:09:05.341 --> 01:09:07.577
- Fuck!
- Get away from me.

01:09:07.676 --> 01:09:10.457
Mom, I can't get out!

01:09:11.417 --> 01:09:14.584
You're weak! Both of you!
And you're always going to be weak!

01:09:14.684 --> 01:09:16.913
Get out of here!

01:09:24.694 --> 01:09:27.709
Please... Mom.

01:09:30.332 --> 01:09:33.568
Come here. Here you go.

01:09:33.667 --> 01:09:35.470
Baby.

01:09:35.569 --> 01:09:39.843
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Mom. I'm so sorry.

01:09:39.943 --> 01:09:41.484
It's okay.

01:09:41.585 --> 01:09:44.379
It's okay now. It's okay.

01:09:44.479 --> 01:09:46.983
Mom, is that the guy?

01:09:47.082 --> 01:09:50.519
Is that the guy from the other night
that you kissed?

01:09:51.430 --> 01:09:53.154
Yeah. It is.

01:09:53.255 --> 01:09:55.623
I didn't know.

01:09:55.723 --> 01:09:57.259
I didn't know. I'm sorry.

01:09:57.359 --> 01:10:00.840
I know, honey. No, it's okay.

01:10:01.040 --> 01:10:03.841
Baby, I'm sorry.

01:10:03.941 --> 01:10:07.970
I'm so sorry I brought that monster
into our life.

01:10:19.626 --> 01:10:22.287
Preston and the big man
are waiting for you.

01:10:22.387 --> 01:10:25.619
- Is it three o'clock already?
- It's 3:17.

01:10:25.719 --> 01:10:27.254
Shit.

01:10:29.222 --> 01:10:32.093
I'm sorry, I was just...
finalizing some numbers.

01:10:32.193 --> 01:10:34.573
Sorry. Okay.

01:10:36.162 --> 01:10:38.123
- Alright, what do you got?
- As we know,

01:10:38.223 --> 01:10:42.369
Elliot and associates has been
primarily involved in technology.

01:10:42.469 --> 01:10:47.400
Where are the numbers? You said
you were going to make a valid argument.

01:10:47.500 --> 01:10:50.875
Yes, it's just that the numbers
are going to take a little bit more time.

01:10:50.975 --> 01:10:55.685
They're a little bit more comprehensive
than I first anticipated. So I just...

01:10:55.785 --> 01:10:57.472
With all due respect...

01:10:57.572 --> 01:11:02.004
I recommend we take their offer
before they pull it off the table.

01:11:02.104 --> 01:11:03.556
I'm inclined to do just that.

01:11:03.656 --> 01:11:06.658
- You know what? No, Dad, please just...
- Please what?

01:11:07.558 --> 01:11:11.367
There's a hundred and fifty million
dollar deal on the table here.

01:11:15.567 --> 01:11:18.836
Preston, I want you to head up
this acquisition personally.

01:11:18.936 --> 01:11:23.594
The usual suspects involved.
Take no prisoners. Kill them all.

01:11:23.694 --> 01:11:27.479
You know, Dad, I can fucking
handle this. I've got it.

01:11:27.579 --> 01:11:30.149
I know what I'm doing.

01:11:31.649 --> 01:11:34.818
Would you gentlemen
excuse me for a moment?

01:11:34.918 --> 01:11:37.165
Let's step outside for a moment.

01:11:50.867 --> 01:11:53.614
I fucking got it?

01:11:54.491 --> 01:11:56.862
Not for long.

01:11:58.707 --> 01:12:00.615
I think you should take
the rest of the day off.

01:12:02.479 --> 01:12:05.508
Maybe the next few days.
You look like you could use it.

01:12:10.287 --> 01:12:11.451
Now please.

01:12:57.297 --> 01:12:59.601
I've been wanting to talk to you.

01:12:59.701 --> 01:13:01.869
What did you want to talk about?

01:13:01.969 --> 01:13:04.804
Your fantasies. I am your master!

01:13:04.904 --> 01:13:06.974
- Don't you fucking forget it!
- Mom! I can't get it off me!

01:13:07.074 --> 01:13:09.475
Your disgraceful
and reprehensible behavior.

01:13:09.575 --> 01:13:11.577
Be afraid of what I'll do
if you don't obey me.

01:13:11.677 --> 01:13:15.768
- A drug dealing car thief?
- He's dangerous.

01:13:23.991 --> 01:13:26.427
- Fuck!
- Shit!

01:13:26.527 --> 01:13:30.998
You can take it but you can't dish it out!
You should leave the pain to the experts.

01:13:31.098 --> 01:13:33.099
Suck my dick, slave!

01:13:33.199 --> 01:13:34.729
You stay the fuck away from my daughter

01:13:34.829 --> 01:13:38.068
or I swear to God you will regret
the day you were born.

01:13:38.170 --> 01:13:42.259
Good. When I met you,
I knew you were weak.

01:13:42.359 --> 01:13:45.343
A pathetic divorcee
who needed some dick.

01:13:45.443 --> 01:13:47.298
I gave you what you wanted!

01:13:47.398 --> 01:13:51.350
I turned you from a mousy little
weakling to a sex goddess.

01:13:51.450 --> 01:13:53.653
You should worship the ground I walk on.

01:13:53.753 --> 01:13:55.149
Fuck you!

01:14:01.226 --> 01:14:03.162
Go cry to your daddy.

01:14:03.662 --> 01:14:07.231
If I want to fuck
your hot daughter, I will.

01:14:35.425 --> 01:14:36.881
What is this?

01:14:36.981 --> 01:14:39.563
Good morning, sunshine.

01:14:40.663 --> 01:14:42.962
I've been thinking...

01:14:43.433 --> 01:14:47.005
I've been thinking
that I would call the police...

01:14:48.105 --> 01:14:50.239
and tell them about you meeting
with my underage daughter

01:14:50.339 --> 01:14:52.974
but then I thought you've wormed
your way out of jail before.

01:14:53.074 --> 01:14:54.949
There's no doubt you'd do it again.

01:14:59.515 --> 01:15:02.047
What I want...

01:15:03.552 --> 01:15:07.737
is to send a very clear message,

01:15:07.890 --> 01:15:12.193
that I can and will kill you.

01:15:18.467 --> 01:15:20.591
Your nipples.

01:15:20.691 --> 01:15:23.530
They're offensively naked.

01:15:35.617 --> 01:15:39.859
You fucking amateur. It's too tight.

01:15:39.959 --> 01:15:43.858
It's not tight enough
if you can still talk.

01:15:48.662 --> 01:15:51.367
Not as bad as I thought you'd be.

01:15:53.967 --> 01:15:56.865
The most offensive of all.

01:16:11.250 --> 01:16:15.109
Let's unzip this. I want to hear
all of your screams.

01:16:16.056 --> 01:16:20.259
Eeny, meany, miney, moe.

01:16:20.359 --> 01:16:23.425
If you put that down right now,
I'll forgive you.

01:16:28.434 --> 01:16:33.939
I don't want your forgiveness.
I don't need your forgiveness.

01:16:48.787 --> 01:16:49.720
More?

01:16:55.493 --> 01:16:56.859
What?

01:17:16.546 --> 01:17:18.753
Still with me?

01:17:26.722 --> 01:17:28.565
Darn.

01:17:35.237 --> 01:17:36.181
Fuck!

01:17:38.706 --> 01:17:41.238
Fucking broke my ankle.

01:17:52.180 --> 01:17:54.265
Ryan?

01:17:59.154 --> 01:18:01.122
What did you learn?

01:18:01.222 --> 01:18:03.960
Stay away from you and your daughter.

01:18:04.560 --> 01:18:06.656
Good boy.

01:18:07.356 --> 01:18:09.413
Good boy.

01:18:15.470 --> 01:18:18.405
Oh, don't fucking leave me.
Don't... my foot. My...

01:18:18.505 --> 01:18:20.375
Well, don't worry.
Someone will be here soon.

01:18:20.475 --> 01:18:23.599
Oh, I did call somebody after all.

01:18:24.244 --> 01:18:26.632
Good luck explaining all those...

01:18:26.732 --> 01:18:31.440
unsolicited messages to my underage
daughter on your hard drive.

01:18:32.085 --> 01:18:34.586
Twisted little fuck.

01:19:05.918 --> 01:19:07.954
Yes?

01:19:08.954 --> 01:19:11.361
I'll be right there. Thank you.

01:19:21.266 --> 01:19:22.815
Hello.

01:19:22.915 --> 01:19:24.035
Hello.

01:19:24.135 --> 01:19:26.138
I'm here to see Jesse Aaron.

01:19:26.338 --> 01:19:27.905
Do you have an appointment?

01:19:28.005 --> 01:19:32.048
Can you let him know that Michelle Mulan
is here and I should see him immediately.

01:19:37.448 --> 01:19:40.719
Okay. Someone did some work!

01:19:40.819 --> 01:19:42.876
Yeah, I did.

01:19:42.976 --> 01:19:46.824
So listen, when Preston and my dad come
have them meet me here immediately.

01:19:46.924 --> 01:19:49.393
- You got it.
- Thank you.

01:19:50.593 --> 01:19:51.639
Michelle Mulan?

01:19:53.385 --> 01:19:55.431
- Nice to meet you.
- He's ready to see you.

01:19:55.531 --> 01:19:57.336
Great.

01:19:58.936 --> 01:20:01.972
You've got a lot of balls, Michelle.
Have a seat.

01:20:02.272 --> 01:20:04.543
- Thank you for...
- Don't thank me yet.

01:20:06.443 --> 01:20:08.081
I...

01:20:08.584 --> 01:20:11.314
I have a proposal for you.

01:20:11.414 --> 01:20:13.064
I've been doing research.

01:20:13.164 --> 01:20:16.236
I've discovered the properties
they are looking into

01:20:16.336 --> 01:20:18.520
and the ones they have
recently acquired.

01:20:18.620 --> 01:20:20.868
I think that I might have a solution

01:20:20.968 --> 01:20:25.412
that can both, benefit us
and all of our problems and them.

01:20:25.512 --> 01:20:27.291
Hear me out.

01:20:27.391 --> 01:20:32.267
925 Canon Drive.
136-1 Old Beverly Drive.

01:20:32.367 --> 01:20:36.906
These are all properties they are going
to close on. All in Beverly Hills.

01:20:38.706 --> 01:20:40.857
I'm listening.

01:20:50.951 --> 01:20:52.629
You can get us these properties?

01:20:53.754 --> 01:20:57.280
I've done the research and I've looked
at your current real estate profile

01:20:57.380 --> 01:21:00.028
and this expands your target areas.

01:21:00.128 --> 01:21:02.949
We have exclusive access
not only to that building

01:21:03.049 --> 01:21:05.031
but to all of the properties
listed there.

01:21:05.131 --> 01:21:10.003
Now understanding their business
model we can provide them.

01:21:10.103 --> 01:21:15.409
Just us because of our reputation
and our connections...

01:21:15.509 --> 01:21:19.980
we can provide them
with 33 Redbook and 480 Doheny.

01:21:20.080 --> 01:21:22.482
That's a hundred million dollar estate.

01:21:22.682 --> 01:21:27.621
Yes, it is, Preston. And a hundred
million dollars is nothing to them.

01:21:27.721 --> 01:21:30.223
Don't interrupt me again.

01:21:31.134 --> 01:21:34.591
The numbers look promising, ambitious.

01:21:34.691 --> 01:21:38.224
- I've put a lot of time and energy into it.
- I like money and that's it.

01:21:38.324 --> 01:21:41.702
So what's to stop me from just buying
this all up myself if we wanted to?

01:21:42.002 --> 01:21:46.639
I don't believe you'd do that. I mean,
I have an NDA disclosure if you'd like it.

01:21:46.739 --> 01:21:48.441
I wouldn't sign it from you.

01:21:49.241 --> 01:21:50.946
But I won't steal your game plan

01:21:51.046 --> 01:21:53.698
or post your contacts either.
I'm not a dick like that.

01:21:53.798 --> 01:21:57.016
What do you know about
the Pacific Design Center?

01:21:57.416 --> 01:22:00.952
Three hundred and twenty five
million dollar building.

01:22:01.052 --> 01:22:03.055
- It's failing.
- How do you know that?

01:22:03.255 --> 01:22:07.592
Because I did the research myself.
I spoke to Paul Sonders.

01:22:07.692 --> 01:22:10.161
Got the information
directly from his mouth.

01:22:10.261 --> 01:22:13.275
I also obtained a selling price.

01:22:13.931 --> 01:22:18.703
You've put together quite the ambitious
proposal. I'm... I'm impressed.

01:22:18.903 --> 01:22:22.239
With your capital and our resources
we can run L.A.

01:22:22.439 --> 01:22:25.842
I heard the pitch.
I heard what you said.

01:22:25.942 --> 01:22:27.478
Look, I'll have my guys review this.

01:22:27.578 --> 01:22:31.783
And if we like it we will maybe restructure
our offer or merger rather.

01:22:31.883 --> 01:22:35.466
Okay, well, in the case
that you do like it

01:22:35.566 --> 01:22:38.572
I've gone ahead and drawn
a little something up.

01:22:38.672 --> 01:22:41.581
If they go for it we stand to make...

01:22:41.681 --> 01:22:45.625
four hundred million dollars
in the next six years.

01:22:45.725 --> 01:22:48.165
How are you going
to get Elliot to go for it?

01:22:48.465 --> 01:22:52.702
Well, that's simple. We'll sit down
and have a little face to face.

01:22:52.802 --> 01:22:55.271
Jesse? He thinks you're a fuck up.

01:22:55.571 --> 01:22:57.340
Not when I'm done with him.

01:22:58.072 --> 01:23:00.576
Jesse, do you mind
if I call you Jesse? Do you?

01:23:00.676 --> 01:23:05.547
I've reviewed your real estate choices
and they're weak at best.

01:23:06.047 --> 01:23:09.388
You know technology, agriculture...

01:23:09.488 --> 01:23:13.455
but you need Mulan Properties
to run your real estate division.

01:23:13.555 --> 01:23:17.052
I can tell you what to buy
and what to sell

01:23:17.152 --> 01:23:20.215
and when to do it
if you want to make money.

01:23:20.315 --> 01:23:22.931
If you're into that kind of thing.

01:23:24.833 --> 01:23:29.803
In all honesty, two to three
hundred million, not that much to me.

01:23:29.903 --> 01:23:33.432
But I am seriously going
to review this because...

01:23:34.007 --> 01:23:36.268
there's something about you.

01:23:36.945 --> 01:23:39.982
I've underestimated you, Michelle Mulan.

01:23:40.882 --> 01:23:43.052
You won't do that again.

01:23:45.032 --> 01:23:48.375
If my team approves you will have
a merger agreement by the end of tomorrow.

01:23:48.475 --> 01:23:51.927
If not, then I'm sorry.
That's all we can do for you.

01:23:52.427 --> 01:23:55.994
Well, then I look forward to seeing you
at the end of business tomorrow.

01:24:12.612 --> 01:24:16.384
Can't believe it's come to this.
Waiting like dogs.

01:24:16.584 --> 01:24:18.485
Have a little faith in me, Preston.

01:24:18.585 --> 01:24:22.121
- Good God.
- That's enough, Preston.

01:24:23.121 --> 01:24:26.790
Seven o'clock. Smells like a fail.

01:24:30.463 --> 01:24:33.031
Sorry we're late. Traffic.

01:24:33.131 --> 01:24:36.304
Hi, Jesse. Thank you for coming.
Have a seat.

01:24:37.704 --> 01:24:42.742
So, I think you'll find the terms
of this merger most favorable.

01:24:43.042 --> 01:24:46.211
I'm sure but we'll have Dad have a look.

01:24:47.411 --> 01:24:52.383
As your father and I used to say,
let's get to the important pages.

01:24:52.683 --> 01:24:55.020
You know, you really
ought to thank Michelle for this.

01:24:55.620 --> 01:24:57.656
She is one savvy lady.

01:24:57.756 --> 01:25:01.258
Preston, I'm surprised you didn't
come to me with this yourself.

01:25:01.358 --> 01:25:03.227
Yeah, I...

01:25:03.627 --> 01:25:06.193
Preston's a little short-sighted.

01:25:07.024 --> 01:25:09.301
So, do we got a deal?

01:25:10.968 --> 01:25:13.254
We do indeed, Jess.

01:25:13.354 --> 01:25:17.040
I'll see you all next week. I'm going
to personally oversee this myself.

01:25:17.140 --> 01:25:20.045
Look forward to it. Thank you.
Thank you, gentlemen.

01:25:22.345 --> 01:25:25.210
Well, Chells, I'm proud of you.

01:25:25.716 --> 01:25:27.896
And... if you take a look right here

01:25:27.996 --> 01:25:33.631
it says the signature is required
by any and all partners.

01:25:33.857 --> 01:25:35.847
Partner?

01:25:35.947 --> 01:25:40.263
Yes, honey. Yes, sweetie, you earned it.

01:25:41.063 --> 01:25:44.934
Preston, this company for the first
time now has a partnership.

01:25:45.034 --> 01:25:48.171
I think you should
congratulate Michelle.

01:25:49.471 --> 01:25:51.749
Congratulations, Michelle.

01:25:53.976 --> 01:25:56.880
I think you can call me boss.

01:25:58.580 --> 01:26:02.076
You... did it.

01:26:02.176 --> 01:26:04.426
And you...

01:26:05.599 --> 01:26:07.660
deserve a treat.

01:26:07.760 --> 01:26:09.591
- I'll take that one.
- Alright.

01:26:09.691 --> 01:26:12.393
I like this success thing.
Let's keep doing it.

01:26:12.493 --> 01:26:16.153
I had one more point I wanted to go over
with you, Michelle, if that is okay.

01:26:16.253 --> 01:26:19.801
Can we... discuss it?

01:26:19.901 --> 01:26:23.471
Yes. Yeah, thanks. Grab the door.

01:26:23.571 --> 01:26:25.912
Have a seat.

01:26:32.612 --> 01:26:35.857
I wanted to know if you wanted
to have dinner with me.

01:26:37.118 --> 01:26:39.525
That would be wonderful.

01:26:44.425 --> 01:26:47.381
Are you sure though that...

01:26:47.881 --> 01:26:50.964
you don't want something...

01:26:51.687 --> 01:26:53.888
maybe...

01:26:55.201 --> 01:26:57.476
a little more...

01:26:58.333 --> 01:27:00.389
kinky?

01:27:01.107 --> 01:27:03.178
Yes, mistress.
