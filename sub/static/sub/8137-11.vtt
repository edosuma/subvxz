00:23.123 --> 00:24.954
The Chameleon has already
threatened to kill you...

00:25.025 --> 00:26.822
if your paths
should ever cross again.

00:26.893 --> 00:29.259
You don't get to be
the Man of a Thousand Faces...

00:29.329 --> 00:30.956
without learning
a few new tricks.

00:32.399 --> 00:35.334
I always thought there wasn't
enough of me to go around.

00:35.402 --> 00:37.870
Here I always thought
there was one too many.

00:40.206 --> 00:43.869
Shall we say the price is
$5 million? Cash, of course.

00:43.943 --> 00:45.877
Shall we say
when can I get it?

00:47.547 --> 00:48.741
Michael!

00:48.815 --> 00:51.147
Just when you think
he's run out of surprises.

01:05.230 --> 01:07.722
Knight Rider,
a shadowy flight...

01:07.801 --> 01:10.292
into the dangerous world
of a man...

01:10.437 --> 01:12.166
who does not exist.

01:20.180 --> 01:22.080
Michael Knight,
a young loner...

01:22.148 --> 01:24.844
on a crusade to champion
the cause of the innocent...

01:24.918 --> 01:26.943
the helpless, the powerless...

01:27.020 --> 01:30.217
in a world of criminals
who operate above the law.

02:38.057 --> 02:40.218
Look at it, Bryson.
Smell it.

02:40.293 --> 02:42.454
Yeah. They must've
just waxed the floors.

02:42.529 --> 02:46.260
I'm not talking about floors, Bryson.
I'm talking about American jurisprudence.

02:46.332 --> 02:47.526
The District Court of Appeals.

02:47.600 --> 02:49.727
The conscience of
the criminal justice system.

02:49.802 --> 02:51.793
Save it for the judge.
I'm just warming up.

02:51.871 --> 02:54.339
In this game, you've got to
come out of the blocks fast.

02:54.407 --> 02:56.102
Do you mind if we
make a little pit stop?

02:56.176 --> 02:58.144
You know, there's always
something with you.

02:58.211 --> 03:00.941
Bryson, will you lighten up?
You'll live longer.

03:01.748 --> 03:03.079
All right.

03:03.416 --> 03:04.644
Come on.

03:07.820 --> 03:09.617
You know the routine.

03:09.956 --> 03:11.617
Age before beauty.

03:15.428 --> 03:18.420
How long you been doing this?
About six years.

04:23.896 --> 04:25.261
Take off your robe.

04:25.331 --> 04:28.357
No, it's not what you think, Your
Honor. Come on, just take it off. Hurry.

04:28.434 --> 04:29.594
That's it. Move it.

04:30.103 --> 04:32.901
Escaped prisoner.
Hit the alarm!

04:51.391 --> 04:54.121
KITT, give me the point spread
on this week's game, will you?

04:54.193 --> 04:56.184
Michael, I really
don't think gambling...

04:56.262 --> 04:58.958
is a proper use
of Foundation equipment.

04:59.232 --> 05:02.599
You're absolutely right. Forget
it. I shouldn't have asked.

05:02.669 --> 05:05.103
I was way, way out of line.

05:05.538 --> 05:08.063
Thank you, Michael.
Just tell me who's gonna win.

05:08.141 --> 05:09.233
Michael!

05:09.309 --> 05:11.777
Devon is calling.
Yo, Devon!

05:13.146 --> 05:16.411
What's up, buddy? Nothing
good, I'm afraid, Michael.

05:16.482 --> 05:20.043
You remember that thief you caught
with a shipment of stolen arms?

05:20.119 --> 05:21.711
J. Gordon Baxter?

05:21.788 --> 05:25.417
Alias, the Chameleon. How can
I forget? But he's in prison.

05:25.525 --> 05:26.992
Was, Michael.

05:27.293 --> 05:31.093
He was scheduled to appear at the
District Court of Appeals this morning.

05:31.164 --> 05:32.756
He's just escaped.

05:32.832 --> 05:36.859
Knowing the Chameleon as well
as I do, he's long gone by now.

05:37.170 --> 05:40.196
Not necessarily. They've
cordoned off the building.

05:40.273 --> 05:42.969
There's reason to believe he
may still be in the vicinity.

05:43.042 --> 05:45.237
All right, I got you.
We're on our way.

05:57.223 --> 05:59.054
You have my sympathies, Judge.

05:59.125 --> 06:02.060
At least I can take this
face off when I'm finished.

06:13.973 --> 06:17.670
He's in there. The escaped
prisoner's in my chambers! Hurry!

06:25.351 --> 06:27.080
He's done it again!

06:48.975 --> 06:51.910
Okay, buddy, out!
I'm commandeering this van.

06:52.078 --> 06:53.602
Did you see
what that lady just did?

06:53.679 --> 06:55.203
KITT, that was no lady.

07:32.852 --> 07:35.377
Michael?
We're going for it, partner.

07:58.911 --> 08:01.641
That's the van
over there, Michael.

08:11.591 --> 08:14.685
It's only been a matter of seconds,
Michael. He couldn't have gotten far.

08:14.760 --> 08:16.591
That's the Chameleon, partner.

08:16.996 --> 08:19.396
Couple of seconds
is all it takes.

08:37.250 --> 08:39.217
I mean, it's remarkable.

08:39.552 --> 08:43.249
Imagine being capable of
producing a mask of this quality...

08:43.322 --> 08:45.756
while locked up
behind prison bars.

08:45.992 --> 08:49.223
You don't get to be The Man of a
Thousand Voices and a Thousand Faces...

08:49.295 --> 08:50.887
without learning
a few new tricks.

08:50.963 --> 08:52.726
I had him, Devon.
I had him!

08:52.798 --> 08:55.460
Yes, it's an all-too-common
story, I'm afraid, Michael.

08:55.535 --> 08:57.264
The important thing
is now...

08:57.336 --> 08:59.827
with his reputation for
stealing sophisticated weapons...

08:59.906 --> 09:01.806
and selling them
to the highest bidder...

09:01.874 --> 09:05.071
he's got to be caught,
and the sooner, the better.

09:05.711 --> 09:08.976
Anything new on him in the
computer? Nothing useful.

09:09.248 --> 09:13.582
He's been in prison since you helped
put him there back in August, 1982.

09:13.853 --> 09:16.083
What about his daughter,
Tonie?

09:16.956 --> 09:20.414
Tonie? According to our information,
she still lives here in town.

09:20.493 --> 09:22.961
Terrific.
It's a good place to start.

09:23.029 --> 09:27.295
Michael, I know it goes without
saying, but I'm going to say it anyway.

09:27.366 --> 09:29.527
Be careful.
I will.

10:04.136 --> 10:07.867
Perhaps later, my place?
Alone?

10:08.240 --> 10:11.437
Believe me, Bertil,
it's not the impossible dream.

10:20.786 --> 10:21.980
My friends, yes.

10:22.054 --> 10:23.954
How are you doing?
Fine.

10:25.625 --> 10:27.490
Excuse me, my good...

10:29.195 --> 10:31.527
Gordon, is that you?

10:32.965 --> 10:36.128
Yes, it is you, isn't it?
Welcome home!

10:37.203 --> 10:41.162
It's good to be back, Armand. I
see, the place is about the same.

10:41.907 --> 10:44.341
Only the bellybuttons
have changed.

10:52.985 --> 10:55.783
It's all right, Ryles.
He's an old friend.

11:00.459 --> 11:03.155
Two years is a long time,
eh, my friend?

11:05.831 --> 11:07.560
You have no idea, Armand.

11:07.633 --> 11:10.033
That's why I plan to make up
for every moment of it.

11:10.102 --> 11:12.502
Of course. Of course.

11:13.606 --> 11:15.335
How may I help you?

11:16.676 --> 11:20.112
First, I need one big job.
And the bigger, the better.

11:22.815 --> 11:24.146
All right.

11:25.184 --> 11:27.448
I've recently received
inquiries about an item...

11:27.520 --> 11:29.920
that might be
right up your alley.

11:30.589 --> 11:32.784
It's called
Project Lone Eagle.

11:33.459 --> 11:36.223
The Air Force is testing
it now at Webly Field.

11:36.295 --> 11:38.422
And how much is in it
for me?

11:38.998 --> 11:40.363
$1 million.

11:41.634 --> 11:43.101
It's a start.

11:43.836 --> 11:45.701
I'm glad you think so.

11:46.772 --> 11:48.899
But you said, "first."

11:49.141 --> 11:51.132
May I ask, what's second?

11:52.011 --> 11:53.069
Yes.

11:54.013 --> 11:57.380
I plan to kill someone
by the name of Michael Knight.

12:00.586 --> 12:02.110
Michael, if Tonie Baxter
lives...

12:02.188 --> 12:04.156
where that so-called music
is coming from...

12:04.223 --> 12:07.158
I suspect she hasn't heard
about her father's escape.

12:07.226 --> 12:08.454
I don't know.

12:08.527 --> 12:11.519
Guess that depends
on how she feels about him.

12:11.597 --> 12:15.158
KITT, run down the name of the top
dog in illegal arms around here.

12:15.534 --> 12:17.161
I'll get right on it, Michael.

12:17.269 --> 12:19.499
And keep...
Your scanner peeled.

12:19.672 --> 12:20.832
Right.

12:29.715 --> 12:31.478
No, thank you.

12:33.519 --> 12:35.282
Who said that?
I did.

12:35.354 --> 12:38.118
Please keep your advertisement
off my person.

12:38.190 --> 12:39.851
"Off your person?"

12:40.226 --> 12:41.454
You're a car!

12:41.527 --> 12:43.085
A figure of speech.

12:44.497 --> 12:47.830
Wow. I've heard of alarm systems
that do everything, but...

12:47.900 --> 12:49.697
now they've got one
that talks.

12:51.470 --> 12:53.370
We all got a job to do.

12:53.506 --> 12:54.837
Not on me!

12:59.779 --> 13:03.237
Look, I got my professional
pride to deal with here!

13:03.315 --> 13:04.873
I got integrity!

13:04.950 --> 13:07.214
When I promise to deliver
500 circulars...

13:07.286 --> 13:10.221
I don't just dump them in the
sewer like some other guys!

13:13.259 --> 13:15.386
The things I'm forced
to put up with.

13:52.898 --> 13:54.889
Michael?
Hi, Tonie.

13:55.467 --> 13:56.559
Whoo!

13:57.102 --> 13:58.763
You look terrific.

13:59.238 --> 14:02.435
The place is kind of a mess.
I've been rehearsing all morning.

14:02.508 --> 14:03.702
It's my band's new song.

14:03.776 --> 14:06.267
I didn't say your place,
I said you.

14:07.179 --> 14:10.342
Don't tell me. You just happened
to be in the neighborhood and...

14:11.350 --> 14:14.410
What's my father done now?
Escaped.

14:14.920 --> 14:19.152
What's that got to do with
me? Tonie, he's your father.

14:19.225 --> 14:20.453
So what?

14:20.593 --> 14:22.993
It's a biological fact,
not a relationship.

14:23.062 --> 14:25.690
Whether you want to believe it
or not, there is a difference.

14:25.764 --> 14:28.460
One doesn't necessarily
equal the other.

14:29.435 --> 14:33.166
Tonie, I know how painful this
is for you. Then why are you here?

14:33.239 --> 14:34.365
Because someone had to come.

14:34.440 --> 14:38.274
I thought you'd rather hear it from me
than from some rookie cop taking notes.

14:40.980 --> 14:44.472
I'm sorry, Michael. You
were straight with me before.

14:44.817 --> 14:48.048
It's just that every time I think
he's out of my life once and for all...

14:48.120 --> 14:51.647
someone knocks on my door, or I
turn on the TV and there he is again.

14:52.558 --> 14:56.688
Looks like you put a lot of room
between you and your old life, huh?

14:57.229 --> 14:59.663
What happened to college?
I quit.

15:00.232 --> 15:02.632
It's all part
of burying the past.

15:02.835 --> 15:05.360
You can see
how successful it's been.

15:05.971 --> 15:07.563
The answer's no.

15:08.307 --> 15:09.399
What?

15:09.541 --> 15:12.101
Your eyes have been asking
ever since you walked in:

15:12.177 --> 15:15.374
"Have you seen your father?
Has he contacted you?"

15:16.181 --> 15:17.512
All right.

15:17.650 --> 15:19.117
You've always
been straight with me.

15:19.184 --> 15:21.584
Your answer's "no."
I got no more questions.

15:21.654 --> 15:22.712
Just one request.

15:22.788 --> 15:26.087
If you happen to see your
father, I'd appreciate a call.

15:26.158 --> 15:27.250
Okay?

15:27.993 --> 15:29.085
Okay.

15:31.664 --> 15:34.963
Don't give up on that
new life. It can be done.

15:55.287 --> 15:57.016
Did she give you anything,
Michael?

15:57.089 --> 15:58.181
Yeah.

15:59.658 --> 16:02.889
The truth.
She hasn't seen him. Yet.

16:03.729 --> 16:06.254
What did you get
on that arms dealer?

16:07.099 --> 16:10.660
Armand Pressler, one of the most
ruthless traffickers in illegal arms...

16:10.736 --> 16:13.034
on the
North American continent.

16:13.105 --> 16:15.198
Sounds like my kind of guy.

16:40.165 --> 16:41.894
KITT, this Armand Pressler...

16:41.967 --> 16:45.334
didn't get to be number one
arms dealer playing with kids.

16:45.404 --> 16:47.269
He's got to think
I'm a top mercenary.

16:47.339 --> 16:48.931
Michael, top mercenaries...

16:49.008 --> 16:50.839
always seem to have
other mercenaries...

16:50.909 --> 16:52.467
out to assassinate them.

16:52.544 --> 16:56.378
Wouldn't you be happier with a more
modest rating, say, fourth or fifth?

16:56.448 --> 16:57.472
Forget it, pal!

16:57.549 --> 17:00.074
Armand only deals with the
best and if I'm not the best...

17:00.152 --> 17:01.983
He won't
lead you to the Chameleon.

17:02.054 --> 17:05.615
That's the bottom line. So
let's make me one mean machine.

17:05.958 --> 17:07.755
As you wish, Michael.

17:09.560 --> 17:12.791
Since soldiers of fortune
invariably use aliases...

17:12.865 --> 17:16.665
you can choose between John
Doe, Jack Smith, or Joe Brown.

17:17.202 --> 17:19.295
I'll take Jack Smith.
Sounds like a winner.

17:19.371 --> 17:20.963
Very well. Jack Smith it is.

17:21.040 --> 17:24.134
Former Special Forces
commando, active in the Congo...

17:24.209 --> 17:26.040
Namibia, Dominican Republic.

17:26.111 --> 17:28.079
Let's not overdo it here!

17:28.146 --> 17:30.274
Michael,
you wanted to be top dog.

17:37.356 --> 17:40.985
Anything else you want to tell me
before I enter this den of jackals?

17:41.093 --> 17:42.185
Yes, Michael.

17:44.630 --> 17:47.758
Don't tell me.
That means, "be careful."

17:47.866 --> 17:49.231
In Swahili.

17:49.368 --> 17:50.960
Thanks, partner.

18:07.352 --> 18:09.650
Hey! You need
a membership card.

18:13.959 --> 18:15.620
My initiation fee.

18:17.096 --> 18:20.395
We don't need any new members.
Then I'll just visit.

18:27.506 --> 18:30.168
That's all right.
I'll just seat myself.

18:46.792 --> 18:48.623
Hi, my name is Ingrid.

18:49.094 --> 18:52.154
Hello, Ingrid. Can I buy
you a drink? Thank you.

18:52.965 --> 18:55.559
Dar Bel Dormey.
Put it on my tab, please.

18:55.634 --> 18:59.331
That's a very good choice.
Cool, fine, elegant. Nice flavor.

18:59.505 --> 19:01.735
Just like a woman
named Ingrid.

19:02.875 --> 19:05.275
And what is your name?
Jack Smith.

19:06.645 --> 19:09.045
Good choice.
I'm glad you like it.

19:09.181 --> 19:13.345
Ingrid, can you tell me where I might
find a man by the name of Armand Pressler?

19:13.418 --> 19:15.443
Yes. Try over there.

19:16.555 --> 19:18.648
I'll see you later?
Mmm-hmm.

19:35.707 --> 19:37.766
Easy, Ryles. Sit. Sit.

19:42.347 --> 19:44.872
That's quite all right.
Don't get up.

19:46.118 --> 19:49.610
Good afternoon, gentlemen.
My name is Jack Smith.

19:50.255 --> 19:54.157
That hardly seems reason enough
to attack my bouncer, Mr. Smith.

19:54.693 --> 19:57.662
He attacked.
I just retaliated.

19:58.497 --> 20:00.488
A man after my own heart.

20:01.567 --> 20:03.933
Now, just why are you here?

20:05.204 --> 20:09.766
I'm in need of something very special.
I heard you were once the man to see.

20:10.375 --> 20:12.639
"Once," as in past tense?

20:13.212 --> 20:15.840
When the Chameleon
was working for you.

20:16.548 --> 20:19.176
But now that he is in prison,
Armand...

20:19.351 --> 20:22.047
they say you've lost
some of your touch.

20:30.729 --> 20:34.563
Whoever "they" are, Mr...
Smith.

20:34.866 --> 20:36.094
Smith...

20:36.535 --> 20:39.265
don't know what
"they" are talking about.

20:40.072 --> 20:44.975
As for the Chameleon, well, I have
someone just as good, if not better.

20:46.245 --> 20:48.145
Fine, I'll talk to him.

20:48.847 --> 20:51.042
No, no, no, I don't think so.

20:51.283 --> 20:53.581
Now, just what is it
you wanted?

20:56.221 --> 20:57.882
Scorpion missiles.

21:00.626 --> 21:02.287
Scorpion missiles?

21:03.128 --> 21:05.528
For that,
I'll need a little time.

21:05.664 --> 21:09.065
Take as long as you want.
Up to 24 hours.

21:10.035 --> 21:11.662
I'll be in touch.

21:15.007 --> 21:17.840
Telephone
for Mr. Armand Pressler.

21:17.909 --> 21:20.503
Telephone
for Mr. Armand Pressler.

21:24.850 --> 21:27.614
KITT, Armand just got a call.
Let's see what it's all about, huh?

21:27.686 --> 21:29.210
Right, Michael.

21:35.427 --> 21:37.361
Ah-ha.
They're using a scrambler.

21:37.429 --> 21:38.726
I'm afraid so, Michael.

21:38.797 --> 21:42.699
A very good one, I might add. It's
beyond my deciphering capabilities.

21:42.768 --> 21:45.498
Bonnie's been dying to try
out that new LBG analyzer.

21:45.570 --> 21:47.162
Here's her big chance.

21:53.979 --> 21:56.675
Tonie. Don't be afraid,
I'm your father.

21:57.516 --> 21:58.710
Father?

21:59.818 --> 22:01.581
Is that the role
you're playing now?

22:01.653 --> 22:03.848
I never stopped
being your father.

22:03.922 --> 22:06.447
What about all those years
you spent in prison?

22:06.525 --> 22:08.720
Or off somewhere
selling guns?

22:08.794 --> 22:12.127
Tonie, a man does
what he has to do. That's all.

22:12.197 --> 22:14.165
And he gets
what he deserves.

22:14.232 --> 22:17.463
In your case, that was prison.
Yeah, but not this time.

22:17.536 --> 22:21.495
No one's ever gonna put me away
again. Especially Michael Knight.

22:22.207 --> 22:24.402
Tonie, what did you tell him?

22:24.543 --> 22:26.977
What could I tell him?
I don't know anything.

22:27.045 --> 22:28.672
Good girl.
Please.

22:30.749 --> 22:33.377
Tonie, look.
I am working on a big one.

22:33.452 --> 22:35.784
This time I'm going to make
more money for us...

22:35.854 --> 22:37.549
than you've ever seen
in your entire life...

22:37.622 --> 22:40.022
and I'm doing it just for us,
honey. For you and me.

22:40.092 --> 22:42.026
I don't want your money.

22:42.094 --> 22:44.255
You want to know
what I want, Dad?

22:44.329 --> 22:46.456
I want you
to leave me alone.

22:46.565 --> 22:50.023
Because you hurt me. And I
don't want to be hurt anymore.

22:50.102 --> 22:51.262
Tonie!

22:52.070 --> 22:55.164
Look, I have to go to the High Desert.
We'll talk about this when I get back.

22:55.240 --> 22:58.801
Baby, believe me. Hurting you is
the last thing I ever want to do.

23:09.921 --> 23:11.286
Getting any closer, Bonnie?

23:11.356 --> 23:12.345
Should be.

23:12.424 --> 23:16.690
The LBG analyzer is on the cutting
edge of sonic distortion technology.

23:17.162 --> 23:18.595
In English please, Bonnie.

23:18.663 --> 23:21.359
It'll break down any scrambled
message, given enough time.

23:21.433 --> 23:24.197
How much time? How much time?
I'll tell you when I get it.

23:35.514 --> 23:37.277
Yes. It's me.

23:37.349 --> 23:40.011
That's it. That's it.
You are beautiful.

23:40.585 --> 23:43.349
The Lone Eagle
is about to fly.

23:44.589 --> 23:45.783
Very good.

23:45.857 --> 23:48.223
And once you finish this job,
my friend...

23:48.293 --> 23:52.059
I have a new buyer
you may wish to meet.

23:52.731 --> 23:56.326
Forget it, Armand.
After this job, I'm retiring.

23:57.736 --> 24:00.967
Lone Eagle.
Any idea what that means?

24:01.606 --> 24:04.439
A code name for the
Chameleon's next target.

24:05.076 --> 24:07.044
Do you know where
that phone call came from?

24:12.551 --> 24:14.917
A phone booth
in the Laurel Canyon area.

24:14.986 --> 24:17.079
Laurel Canyon.
That's where Tonie lives.

24:17.189 --> 24:19.657
Michael, do you think
he's gone to meet her?

24:19.724 --> 24:22.352
I don't think, Devon. I know.

24:39.744 --> 24:43.407
Now that's what I call a very
nice flowing, easy stride.

24:43.548 --> 24:45.209
How did you find me?

24:45.283 --> 24:47.877
Don't tell me that car
of yours is psychic, too.

24:47.953 --> 24:48.977
Almost.

24:49.054 --> 24:52.490
But this time I asked your
friendly next door neighbor.

24:53.291 --> 24:55.191
You mind if I join you?

24:55.694 --> 24:57.184
Michael, you're weird.

24:57.262 --> 25:01.528
Why? Half the men in
America jog. With their dogs.

25:01.600 --> 25:02.692
Not their cars.

25:02.767 --> 25:04.860
Rocky Marciano,
Muhammad Ali...

25:04.936 --> 25:06.870
are still pretty
after all those fights.

25:06.938 --> 25:08.838
The Bronx Bomber,
Joe Louis...

25:08.907 --> 25:12.138
every one of them did road work
with their car following behind them.

25:12.210 --> 25:14.405
Right, KITT?
Whatever you say, Michael.

25:14.513 --> 25:16.538
There.
I take that back.

25:16.982 --> 25:18.381
You're both weird.

25:18.450 --> 25:21.749
Now what do you want? To know
what your father said to you.

25:21.820 --> 25:23.117
I haven't seen him.

25:23.188 --> 25:26.646
What happened to us playing
it straight with each other?

25:26.958 --> 25:28.118
Tonie?

25:28.894 --> 25:30.759
All right, he came by.

25:31.296 --> 25:32.854
Thanks for calling.

25:32.931 --> 25:34.922
Michael, whatever he's done,
he's my father.

25:35.000 --> 25:37.696
It's a biological fact,
remember?

25:37.903 --> 25:42.033
He's also the one who caused you to give
up college and a very promising future.

25:42.107 --> 25:43.836
Meaning, as a singer,
I should take up law?

25:43.909 --> 25:46.605
No, meaning,
you don't owe him anything.

25:49.114 --> 25:52.174
Tonie, I'm sorry.
Just tell me what he's after.

25:52.551 --> 25:54.644
He didn't tell me, Michael.

25:55.987 --> 25:57.784
And that's the truth.

25:58.256 --> 26:01.350
All right. You have no
idea where I can find him?

26:01.760 --> 26:02.784
No.

26:03.662 --> 26:04.890
Only...

26:05.163 --> 26:06.255
What?

26:06.598 --> 26:10.056
He said something about having
to go to the High Desert.

26:10.602 --> 26:12.160
And I don't think
it was for his health.

26:12.237 --> 26:14.034
That makes two of us,
thank you.

26:21.046 --> 26:22.070
Bonnie, fill me in...

26:22.147 --> 26:23.774
on High Desert
defense installations.

26:23.848 --> 26:25.873
He could hit any of
a dozen places, Michael.

26:25.951 --> 26:28.977
They're all low profile,
high security testing sites.

26:29.054 --> 26:31.022
It's hard to learn
much about them.

26:31.089 --> 26:33.319
Well, the Chameleon
managed to.

26:34.025 --> 26:38.553
KITT, does any of them show a computer
file on the Lone Eagle Project?

26:43.702 --> 26:44.828
I have it, Michael.

26:44.903 --> 26:49.135
Webly Field is conducting
tests on a project X12JP1.

26:49.207 --> 26:51.072
Code name. Lone Eagle.

26:51.343 --> 26:55.677
Bonnie, have Devon warn the base.
They could be in for a nasty surprise.

27:08.927 --> 27:12.294
Just keep driving, Major.
I'll tell you when to stop.

27:18.670 --> 27:21.264
Michael, we've reached the
outer limits of Webly Field.

27:21.339 --> 27:23.102
Give me the ETA
for the main base.

27:23.174 --> 27:25.472
Two point five minutes,
Michael.

27:34.319 --> 27:36.617
Morning, sir.
Morning, Sergeant.

27:39.357 --> 27:40.824
Your ID, sir?

27:44.696 --> 27:46.721
Thank you, Major Anderson.

28:42.120 --> 28:44.850
All right,
tap the base security channel.

28:46.925 --> 28:48.017
All's quiet, Michael.

28:48.093 --> 28:50.789
There's no breach of security
indicated.

28:51.362 --> 28:53.455
There's gotta be something.

28:54.132 --> 28:56.066
Use your infrared
to scan the area.

28:57.635 --> 28:59.227
Michael, there's
a four-wheeled vehicle...

28:59.304 --> 29:00.862
heading for the
ordinance testing ground...

29:00.939 --> 29:02.634
and it's traveling fast.

29:02.707 --> 29:05.437
All right, use the IGP
and try for an ID.

29:11.683 --> 29:13.810
It's him, Michael.
E. Gordon Baxter.

29:13.885 --> 29:16.820
I think we just
caught ourselves a chameleon.

29:17.388 --> 29:18.912
Let's nail him!

29:46.851 --> 29:48.546
KITT, where does this road go?

29:48.620 --> 29:52.283
He's outsmarted himself, Michael.
It dead ends at a cliff just ahead.

29:52.357 --> 29:53.984
We've got him.
Don't count on it.

29:54.058 --> 29:58.461
He might disguise himself as a
rock or a bush, or even a chameleon.

30:01.199 --> 30:02.223
There he is.

30:02.300 --> 30:03.324
I see him.

30:03.401 --> 30:06.063
Michael, what on earth
is he putting on his back?

30:06.137 --> 30:09.129
Something tells me that's the
Project Lone Eagle, partner.

30:36.134 --> 30:39.501
I'll give the Chameleon credit
for a brilliant deception.

30:39.804 --> 30:42.364
He walked right through
top security...

30:42.440 --> 30:45.238
and flew off
with their prototype jetpack.

30:45.577 --> 30:48.102
KITT, give me everything
you've got on the Lone Eagle.

30:49.147 --> 30:51.274
It makes all its predecessors
look like toys.

30:51.349 --> 30:53.112
It can stay airborne
six minutes...

30:53.184 --> 30:55.982
has stealth scramblers
and night-flight vision.

30:56.054 --> 30:58.045
What about its
offensive capabilities?

30:58.122 --> 31:01.114
Definitely possible, but
still in the development stage.

31:01.226 --> 31:03.524
Imagine what a terrorist
could do with that.

31:03.595 --> 31:06.029
Yeah, and now it's on its
way to Armand Pressler.

31:06.097 --> 31:07.496
You call the bank, will you?

31:07.565 --> 31:09.396
I'm gonna need some money
to flash around.

31:09.467 --> 31:10.729
How much?

31:11.202 --> 31:12.692
Say, $500,000.

31:14.973 --> 31:15.962
Dollars?

31:16.040 --> 31:19.100
I can't go in there
with yen or shekels, can I?

31:19.177 --> 31:21.645
Now, if I'm a high roller,
I got to look like one.

31:45.570 --> 31:48.471
Michael, your pulse
and adrenalin levels are high.

31:48.539 --> 31:49.528
Phew!

31:49.607 --> 31:53.236
Right where they should be,
partner. Got a lot of bread in here.

31:53.311 --> 31:55.211
Keep your scanner warm.

32:10.428 --> 32:12.555
Oh, no! Not you again.

32:14.999 --> 32:16.159
You really a talking car?

32:16.234 --> 32:18.964
No, I'm a tight end
for the Chicago Bears.

32:19.037 --> 32:21.005
I like the 49ers myself.

32:21.239 --> 32:23.935
You work hard. Don't you think
you deserve some time off?

32:24.008 --> 32:25.635
Like a few years?

32:26.110 --> 32:29.910
Are you kidding? I'm performing
a very important service here.

32:29.981 --> 32:33.849
See this? It's got a puzzle
on it. It's a tough one.

32:34.118 --> 32:37.849
But whoever figures it out wins
a fortune in valuable prizes.

32:38.423 --> 32:42.860
I mean, I could be responsible for
changing somebody's whole life around.

32:44.162 --> 32:45.390
Bye-bye.

32:54.706 --> 32:56.230
A tough puzzle?

33:05.049 --> 33:06.983
It's a good way
to lose a hand.

33:07.051 --> 33:09.747
But, Mr. Smith,
I don't understand.

33:10.154 --> 33:13.419
You saying you are no longer
interested in the Scorpion missile?

33:13.491 --> 33:15.516
You heard what I said, Armand.

33:15.593 --> 33:18.221
I want the Lone Eagle jetpack,
instead.

33:18.663 --> 33:22.997
It was stolen yesterday by a man who
could have only been the Chameleon.

33:25.203 --> 33:27.933
Now, can you deliver
or can you not deliver?

33:28.006 --> 33:31.066
I'm sorry.
I already have another buyer.

33:32.677 --> 33:36.943
However, I'm not a man to let
honor stand in the way of greed.

33:37.415 --> 33:41.078
Shall we say the price is
$5 million? Cash, of course.

33:41.152 --> 33:43.382
Shall we say
when can I get it?

33:44.355 --> 33:47.381
Call me here in an hour. I'll
tell you the time and the place.

33:47.458 --> 33:50.291
Now, if this is too heavy
for you to carry.

33:51.029 --> 33:54.123
No, thank you very much.
I believe I can manage.

34:11.849 --> 34:14.079
What do you think
you're doing?

34:15.620 --> 34:17.713
What I do best, make money.

34:18.356 --> 34:21.655
Shouldn't you be getting
the rockets for the jetpack?

34:22.592 --> 34:24.857
For your information,
that was Michael Knight...

34:24.929 --> 34:27.762
from The Foundation
for Law and Government.

34:28.266 --> 34:31.099
Well, what do you know
about that?

34:32.203 --> 34:34.330
I thought
you were going to kill him?

34:34.405 --> 34:36.202
That's right, Armand.

34:36.574 --> 34:39.407
And I know just the way.

34:55.893 --> 34:57.417
If it goes the way I plan...

34:57.495 --> 35:00.259
we'll smoke out the jetpack
and the Chameleon.

35:00.398 --> 35:02.161
Michael, it's Devon.

35:02.467 --> 35:03.456
Yo, Devon.

35:03.534 --> 35:05.729
Michael, you've just had
a call from Tonie Baxter.

35:05.803 --> 35:07.828
She needs to talk to you
right away.

35:07.905 --> 35:09.964
Okay, I'll get her
and keep you posted.

35:10.041 --> 35:11.030
All right.

35:11.209 --> 35:12.938
KITT, get me Tonie.

35:18.916 --> 35:20.076
Hello?

35:20.418 --> 35:21.680
Michael, I need to see you.

35:22.153 --> 35:23.552
Tonie, is something wrong?

35:23.621 --> 35:24.679
Michael, he's here.

35:25.056 --> 35:28.219
He's had a change of heart and
he wants to turn himself in.

35:28.292 --> 35:29.384
Only he's afraid.

35:30.094 --> 35:32.722
Afraid of who?
The police? Armand?

35:33.164 --> 35:35.792
Everyone. Michael, I've never
seen him like this before.

35:35.867 --> 35:38.131
He's afraid he won't even
make it back to prison alive.

35:38.603 --> 35:41.333
All right, Tonie, you have my
word. I won't let anyone hurt him.

35:41.405 --> 35:42.429
I'm on my way.

35:42.907 --> 35:43.965
Goodbye, Michael.

35:48.079 --> 35:50.343
KITT, call Devon
and fill him in on this.

35:50.414 --> 35:52.382
Michael, you know
this could be a trap.

35:52.450 --> 35:55.544
Way ahead of you, partner.
I'm way ahead of you.

36:06.030 --> 36:07.793
Keep your eyes open.

36:17.408 --> 36:19.000
Michael,
thank God you're here.

36:19.076 --> 36:21.010
Where's your father?
In the kitchen.

36:27.885 --> 36:28.977
Take it easy.

36:35.226 --> 36:36.818
Who are you?
Where's my father?

36:36.894 --> 36:38.361
He had another appointment to keep.

36:38.429 --> 36:39.794
Michael, I didn't know.
I swear.

36:39.864 --> 36:41.229
I know, Tonie.
It's all right.

36:41.299 --> 36:43.733
Look, it's me you want.
Let her go.

36:43.868 --> 36:47.099
Fat chance, Knight.
Or should I say, Smith?

36:48.072 --> 36:51.007
Now let's move toward
the back, slow and easy.

36:51.609 --> 36:53.270
You first, Knight.

36:53.744 --> 36:55.371
No fancy stuff...

36:56.080 --> 36:57.877
or she gets it first.

37:04.088 --> 37:07.353
All right, I'm asking you one
more time. Leave the girl here.

37:07.425 --> 37:08.756
Forget it.

37:09.126 --> 37:11.026
Michael was right, Devon.
It's a trap.

37:11.095 --> 37:13.029
I hope to heaven
he hasn't been hurt.

37:13.097 --> 37:15.998
Not yet, but these plans
of his make me nervous.

37:16.100 --> 37:17.795
And they have Tonie as well.

37:17.902 --> 37:20.803
Be ready when he needs you, KITT.
Don't let him out of your sight.

37:20.871 --> 37:22.634
Not a chance, Devon.

37:24.175 --> 37:25.767
Okay, you drive.

37:26.010 --> 37:28.843
I'm in back with her,
so don't try anything funny.

37:28.913 --> 37:30.813
Phase two KITT, right now.

37:40.324 --> 37:42.315
This is the police.

37:50.234 --> 37:52.327
I'll ask you once.
You better listen good.

37:52.403 --> 37:54.598
Where is the Chameleon going?

37:55.306 --> 37:57.399
All right.
Have it your way.

37:59.710 --> 38:02.645
Okay. Okay. He's heading
for JBX Industries.

38:02.713 --> 38:03.805
That's all I know.

38:03.881 --> 38:05.007
That's plenty.

38:14.692 --> 38:15.954
Let's go.

38:16.294 --> 38:17.522
Jump in.

38:20.164 --> 38:21.495
Nice job, KITT.

38:21.565 --> 38:24.466
Have Devon call the police
and pick up the garbage.

38:24.535 --> 38:27.333
Give me anything you got
on JBX Industries.

38:39.116 --> 38:40.708
Amazing.

38:40.918 --> 38:43.512
You really must show me
how to do that.

38:43.587 --> 38:46.385
I'd like to make up
as my wife's hairdresser.

38:46.457 --> 38:50.154
It might be interesting to hear
what she has to say about me.

38:50.227 --> 38:51.489
JBX Industries.

38:51.562 --> 38:54.531
Hello, this is Devon Miles from the
Foundation of Law and Government.

38:54.598 --> 38:57.066
I'd like to talk to
the head of plant security.

38:57.501 --> 39:00.129
You sure your people
understand about Tonie?

39:00.204 --> 39:01.228
Stop worrying.

39:01.305 --> 39:04.638
I'm in the business of supplying
arms, not hurting young women.

39:06.210 --> 39:09.509
Devon, it's nice to hear from
you again. This is John Maxwell.

39:09.580 --> 39:10.706
What can I do for you?

39:10.781 --> 39:13.750
John, we've been contacted by
the Department of Defense...

39:13.818 --> 39:17.686
to make an emergency check of
your facility today at 1400 hours.

39:17.755 --> 39:20.622
That's rather short notice. And
you know how they are in Washington.

39:20.691 --> 39:21.851
I'll be sending
Michael Knight.

39:21.926 --> 39:25.123
He'll have the proper papers signed
by the Secretary and bearing his seal.

39:28.866 --> 39:32.063
And a half an hour after that, you'll
have a fancy little flying machine...

39:32.136 --> 39:33.603
armed with
prototype rockets...

39:33.671 --> 39:37.402
that can destroy anything from
a tank to an aircraft carrier.

39:44.582 --> 39:47.813
Michael, I have the
information on JBX Industries.

39:47.885 --> 39:49.147
All right,
let's have it.

39:49.220 --> 39:52.417
They have the government
contract for RX-9 rockets.

39:53.023 --> 39:55.548
Whoa! That's
a gruesome little fella.

39:55.926 --> 39:58.156
They carry the punch
of a Sidewinder missile...

39:58.229 --> 40:00.493
but aren't any bigger
than your arm.

40:00.564 --> 40:04.261
Perfect to mount on a
jetpack, right? I'm afraid so.

40:07.505 --> 40:08.995
Hang in there.

40:09.974 --> 40:11.498
We'll stop him.

40:12.910 --> 40:15.208
Security looks
excellent so far.

40:16.714 --> 40:19.842
This door opens
only when we make a shipment.

40:21.752 --> 40:25.347
And this is the only
card key. Sounds great.

40:27.525 --> 40:29.322
Show me how it works.

40:29.994 --> 40:31.359
What's the meaning of this,
Knight?

40:31.429 --> 40:34.990
Open the doors or I'll blow
you away and do it myself.

40:48.379 --> 40:49.710
After you.

41:51.041 --> 41:52.668
Where do you think
you're going? With you.

41:52.743 --> 41:54.108
You stay in the car.

42:06.323 --> 42:09.258
I always thought there wasn't
enough of me to go around.

42:09.326 --> 42:11.920
And here I always thought
there was one too many.

42:22.072 --> 42:24.632
Give it up, Baxter.
No way!

42:24.708 --> 42:26.733
I'm too close to my dream.

42:33.384 --> 42:35.011
Not close enough.

42:35.886 --> 42:38.480
Hey, they're loaded. Let's
get out of here. Come on.

42:53.003 --> 42:55.733
Michael!
Tonie, get out of here. Go!

42:56.740 --> 42:58.173
KITT, I need you, buddy.

43:04.448 --> 43:05.710
Let's go.

43:12.590 --> 43:14.319
KITT, pop the trunk!

43:28.839 --> 43:29.965
You all right?

43:40.951 --> 43:43.181
Does that
answer your question?

43:44.355 --> 43:45.481
Beautiful.

43:46.357 --> 43:48.348
All right, let's get him.

44:01.905 --> 44:05.341
I have their van, Michael.
All right, let's move on it.

44:20.991 --> 44:23.585
It looks like
we lost Knight for good.

44:27.998 --> 44:29.966
I don't believe my eyes.

44:30.768 --> 44:32.429
Stay ahead of him.

44:37.975 --> 44:39.237
Look out!

45:12.209 --> 45:13.540
Michael,
you're not thinking of...

45:13.610 --> 45:15.475
You bet I am.

45:50.214 --> 45:53.047
All right, let's go.
Chameleons hate water.

46:13.337 --> 46:14.964
Good work, buddy.

46:15.038 --> 46:18.371
Notify Devon to pick up Armand
and his merry brigade, will you?

46:18.442 --> 46:20.069
Right away, Michael.

46:21.011 --> 46:23.741
Now you can get on
with your life, Tonie.

46:44.067 --> 46:45.398
Good, huh?

46:54.011 --> 46:55.638
Hot! Hot! Hot!

46:56.814 --> 46:58.805
Very good.
Thank you, Michael.

46:58.882 --> 47:01.146
I hear you and your group
may be going to London.

47:01.218 --> 47:02.651
The group's going,
but not me.

47:02.719 --> 47:05.313
I've decided to go back to
school and get my degree.

47:05.389 --> 47:08.620
That's great. Not that you
couldn't make it as a singer.

47:08.692 --> 47:10.683
But I think going back
to school is a good idea.

47:10.761 --> 47:11.750
Thanks.

47:11.829 --> 47:14.627
Michael, this time
I need your help.

47:20.571 --> 47:21.595
What's all this?

47:21.672 --> 47:24.232
This is distressing,
that's what it is.

47:24.308 --> 47:26.640
I don't know how he did it,
but this little T-top...

47:26.710 --> 47:30.202
figured out the puzzle and won a
lifetime supply of auto accessories.

47:30.280 --> 47:31.269
No kidding.

47:31.348 --> 47:34.146
Congratulations, buddy.
Check this out.

47:34.218 --> 47:36.277
Girls, velvet seat covers.

47:36.920 --> 47:39.218
A compass,
in case you get lost.

47:39.356 --> 47:41.153
A perfumed Christmas tree.

47:41.225 --> 47:44.023
A pair of fur dice to hang
from your mirror. Great, huh?

47:44.595 --> 47:47.223
Look, a horn
that plays Happy Birthday.

47:47.464 --> 47:49.193
Buddy, how did you do it?

47:50.400 --> 47:52.800
you know me with puzzles,
Michael.

47:52.870 --> 47:54.804
And when I saw that one
in the circular...

47:54.872 --> 47:57.363
I know. They made a
puzzle you couldn't refuse.

47:57.441 --> 48:00.137
Check this out.
Lace curtains, huh?

48:00.210 --> 48:02.735
Michael, where did I go wrong?

48:03.305 --> 48:09.696
