00:11.620 --> 00:12.780
Do something.

00:12.860 --> 00:15.140
Do something for the revolution.

00:15.220 --> 00:16.740
I'm filming.

00:18.860 --> 00:21.900
This is the Ukrainian Revolution.

00:22.940 --> 00:24.220
It's fun.

00:26.220 --> 00:30.300
They're shooting over there!

00:30.380 --> 00:32.659
Don't go there!

00:32.740 --> 00:36.220
Don't go there!
They're shooting over there!

00:37.820 --> 00:40.900
There, he fell.

00:40.980 --> 00:44.780
I was just dragging a dead body.

00:44.860 --> 00:49.020
I stepped in blood.
You can't surprise me with anything.

00:50.500 --> 00:52.660
You thought it would be easy,
just go to Maidan,

00:52.740 --> 00:54.820
hang out a little and then go back?

00:54.900 --> 00:57.620
Not me.
I always wanted to be on the front lines.

00:59.780 --> 01:02.620
That's it. He's dead.

01:04.000 --> 01:10.074
-= www.OpenSubtitles.org =-

02:52.540 --> 02:56.540
There is no alternative
to the integration with the EU.

02:58.660 --> 03:01.340
Something was promised to people,

03:01.420 --> 03:05.100
everything was working toward this,

03:05.180 --> 03:06.460
and then...

03:06.540 --> 03:08.460
On November 21st,

03:08.540 --> 03:11.940
Prime Minister Azarov said
they were not signing the agreement.

03:12.020 --> 03:17.900
It was hard to make a decision
to stop the process

03:17.980 --> 03:21.700
of signing the EU Free Trade Agreement.

03:21.780 --> 03:25.580
Listen, listen, you can always scream.
We know you can scream.

03:28.340 --> 03:34.180
It's a big step backwards,
not just a step of one generation,

03:34.260 --> 03:37.460
but all the way back
to my grandparents in the USSR.

03:38.620 --> 03:44.580
This outraged people,
not just because times are tough now,

03:44.660 --> 03:47.780
but they also stole our children's future.

03:48.580 --> 03:51.020
My friend wrote me on Facebook,

03:51.100 --> 03:52.820
"Did you see Mustafa's call
to come to Maidan?"

03:52.900 --> 03:53.980
STATUS UPDATE

03:54.060 --> 03:57.660
I said, "Yes, I saw it".

03:57.740 --> 03:59.860
I was working late.

03:59.940 --> 04:03.940
I opened Facebook
and the first post I saw said

04:04.020 --> 04:06.380
to come to Maidan.

04:06.460 --> 04:09.420
I closed my laptop.

04:09.500 --> 04:15.660
The next time I opened it
was a month and a half later.

04:25.900 --> 04:28.900
Everything began here on Maidan.

04:28.980 --> 04:33.660
First, there were about 300-400 people.

04:33.740 --> 04:36.220
We were looking at each other and saying,

04:36.300 --> 04:39.540
"Where are these thousands
of people that Mustafa called?"

04:39.620 --> 04:45.900
People gradually began to come out

04:45.980 --> 04:48.220
from the subway and public transport,

04:48.300 --> 04:51.700
and in half an hour there were
already thousands of people.

04:59.460 --> 05:02.700
The next day,
people woke up and went to Maidan.

05:02.780 --> 05:07.300
Despite the rain, we were here.

05:09.780 --> 05:12.660
I came here because several days ago,

05:12.740 --> 05:15.060
our government crossed out
the future of Ukraine,

05:15.140 --> 05:17.700
and the aspirations of Ukrainian youth.

05:17.780 --> 05:20.220
I came here to defend my future,

05:20.300 --> 05:24.260
the future of my children,
compatriots and country.

05:26.580 --> 05:30.980
Vitali Klitschko came to Maidan when he
saw that a huge crowd was gathering there.

05:31.060 --> 05:36.100
He brought his truck
with the banner of his political party

05:36.180 --> 05:39.140
but people made him take it away.

05:42.540 --> 05:45.780
In general, these were people
indifferent to politics.

05:47.060 --> 05:53.260
Ukraine is part of Europe!

05:57.500 --> 05:59.540
When students started to mass together,

05:59.620 --> 06:03.340
it became clear that
something was gonna happen.

06:03.420 --> 06:06.900
Ukraine is part of Europe!

06:12.580 --> 06:15.540
Ukraine is part of Europe!

06:15.620 --> 06:18.660
What energy there was!
I have no words to express it!

06:18.740 --> 06:20.660
Some people outside Maidan
were angry with us,

06:20.740 --> 06:24.140
saying, "It's like a festival,
not a protest.

06:24.940 --> 06:28.380
You are just standing,
singing songs and dancing."

06:28.460 --> 06:31.420
We are standing here to prove
that Ukraine is a European country,

06:31.500 --> 06:34.860
to reverse the existing political regime.

06:34.940 --> 06:37.380
We dream of a better future.

06:39.340 --> 06:41.340
I went to a cafÃ©,

06:41.420 --> 06:45.180
and I sat at a table
with some of the students,

06:45.260 --> 06:48.940
and I fell in love with these kids,

06:49.020 --> 06:54.740
because their souls are so pure,
and they believe in Ukraine so much.

06:56.700 --> 07:00.740
Look at the people,
how inspired they are,

07:00.820 --> 07:05.740
not because of alcohol or drugs,
but because of togetherness.

07:08.060 --> 07:11.180
Together, till the end!

07:12.700 --> 07:18.500
I'm applauding for those who came out
for European integration.

07:21.700 --> 07:23.820
People came out because
the government promised them

07:23.900 --> 07:27.660
to make an agreement
with the European Union,

07:27.740 --> 07:34.140
so we'll finally have steps
to live as a European country...

07:34.220 --> 07:36.940
like a part of the civil world.

07:37.620 --> 07:40.100
Sign!

07:40.180 --> 07:42.700
Yanukovych, sign the agreement!

07:42.780 --> 07:44.860
Sign!

07:46.260 --> 07:48.900
This is our document!

07:48.980 --> 07:50.580
We gathered in Maidan,

07:50.660 --> 07:56.100
to demand our politicians
sign the agreement with the EU!

07:56.180 --> 07:58.460
We're waiting on tomorrow's signing.

07:58.540 --> 08:01.580
The Maidan of 2004 started the same way.

08:01.660 --> 08:07.220
People were standing for their rights,
and they proved that we have the power.

08:07.300 --> 08:11.380
Do what we want!

08:18.700 --> 08:20.340
A miracle didn't happen,

08:20.420 --> 08:22.460
and European Union leaders
and Ukraine have failed to sign

08:22.540 --> 08:25.180
an historic free trade deal after
a last minute U-turn from Kyiv.

08:30.060 --> 08:32.539
Shame!

08:32.620 --> 08:39.020
Convict out!

08:39.100 --> 08:44.580
Shame! Shame!

08:45.340 --> 08:49.100
There were quite a lot of police.
They began encircling Maidan.

08:49.180 --> 08:51.420
Police cars were approaching.

08:52.580 --> 08:55.020
During the whole day
we had the feeling,

08:55.100 --> 08:58.220
that the Berkut Special Forces
had been preparing for something.

08:59.180 --> 09:01.580
I'd like to pronounce one word:

09:01.660 --> 09:08.340
Re-vo-lu-tion.

09:08.420 --> 09:11.020
Re-vo-lu-tion!

09:22.820 --> 09:26.540
Take down the regime!

09:28.340 --> 09:31.820
The police with the people!

09:39.780 --> 09:43.340
Girls stood in the center,
and boys filled the stairs.

09:44.340 --> 09:46.460
The girls began to sing
the national anthem.

09:54.820 --> 09:56.260
Stop!

09:57.260 --> 09:59.140
Stop!

10:06.660 --> 10:08.980
I'm falling!

10:19.020 --> 10:22.300
What the hell are you doing? Why?

10:26.540 --> 10:28.980
Be careful!

10:30.020 --> 10:34.540
The troops beat everyone with iron sticks
instead of plastic ones.

10:35.780 --> 10:39.420
It seemed that even they were surprised

10:39.500 --> 10:42.140
by injuries they had made using them.

10:47.900 --> 10:49.940
Why?

10:50.900 --> 10:55.220
My friends called me and
I heard people screaming and crying,

10:55.300 --> 10:58.660
and I immediately understood
what was going on.

11:00.300 --> 11:02.900
And you want to cry, to run,
to break something,

11:02.980 --> 11:07.580
because you realize you can't do anything
to stop this mass destruction machine.

11:18.220 --> 11:20.060
There were girls! Kids were there!

11:20.140 --> 11:22.980
They pushed the 18-year-old girl
and started beating her.

11:23.060 --> 11:25.260
They beat people in the back,
people fell down,

11:25.340 --> 11:26.820
but they continued beating them.

11:26.900 --> 11:31.660
I just wanted to find a girl
that got lost there.

11:32.900 --> 11:36.660
But they didn't understand that
and started beating.

11:36.740 --> 11:39.300
They didn't act like human beings.

11:52.060 --> 11:53.980
When I asked them why,

11:54.060 --> 11:57.780
they answered,
"Be grateful you're not being arrested."

11:57.860 --> 12:02.380
The motto, "police with people"
is absolutely incorrect,

12:02.460 --> 12:05.500
because all of them stand entirely
with the asshole president.

12:05.580 --> 12:08.100
There are such bastards in the police,

12:08.180 --> 12:12.140
that I'm not surprised that our president
is such a person as Yanukovych.

12:37.380 --> 12:40.500
People who managed
to escape from Maidan

12:40.580 --> 12:46.100
moved to Mykhaylivs'kyi
zolotoverkhyi Monastery.

12:59.740 --> 13:01.300
My friend is injured,

13:01.380 --> 13:04.300
he has a concussion
and he's in the hospital now.

13:04.380 --> 13:07.860
My wife's arm is heavily bruised.

13:09.420 --> 13:13.500
I feel well enough,
although my head is injured.

13:13.580 --> 13:15.500
It's nothing serious.

13:15.580 --> 13:18.420
I wanted to take away his stick,

13:18.500 --> 13:21.740
but another Berkut came,

13:21.820 --> 13:24.060
and shattered my eye with his stick.

13:25.500 --> 13:29.220
At 7:30 a.m., the Berkut pulled up.

13:29.300 --> 13:32.780
Their bus stopped at the gate.

13:40.300 --> 13:42.380
What do you want from us?

13:43.260 --> 13:47.340
-Hello, how are you there?
-Oh, come on, stop these provocations.

13:47.420 --> 13:49.660
Provocations? You are the one
who broke into the church.

13:49.740 --> 13:53.100
-Take away your bus and leave!
-I said we won't hurt you, okay?

13:53.180 --> 13:56.780
-I said we won't hurt you.
-You should've thought of that earlier.

14:01.500 --> 14:05.980
At the monastery, we tried
to understand what had happened.

14:08.420 --> 14:09.740
We were afraid.

14:09.820 --> 14:12.300
And if we don't want
to be afraid tomorrow,

14:12.380 --> 14:15.140
we have to come out
and defend our position today.

14:21.020 --> 14:24.340
Around 11:00 a.m.,
there was no free space.

14:24.420 --> 14:27.620
The monastery was filled to capacity.

14:28.140 --> 14:30.940
We opened a food center,

14:32.300 --> 14:34.740
and a drop-off to provide warm clothes.

14:34.820 --> 14:40.780
We put tables over there,
and created a legal aid center.

14:42.380 --> 14:47.140
The medical center
was near that wall.

14:47.220 --> 14:51.700
An information center was also here.

14:55.300 --> 15:00.420
The government wanted to stop
this at the grassroots level,

15:00.500 --> 15:02.980
but the reaction was opposite.

15:07.260 --> 15:10.180
For Ukrainians and the country,

15:10.260 --> 15:14.980
it was the first time when the government
so openly and brutally

15:15.060 --> 15:17.060
demonstrated they're against
peaceful protests.

15:17.140 --> 15:19.180
Ukraine, wake up!

15:21.300 --> 15:24.340
People started protesting
because they're sick and tired.

15:24.420 --> 15:26.700
At this point, it's not even about
European integration anymore.

15:26.780 --> 15:30.100
People just want to live in freedom.

15:32.300 --> 15:35.940
Please don't let them provoke you!

15:36.020 --> 15:38.660
We are not going to leave.
People from all regions of Ukraine...

15:38.740 --> 15:39.740
VINNYTSYA
LUGANSK

15:39.820 --> 15:41.620
should come to Kyiv and support us.

15:41.700 --> 15:43.540
Our aim is to reverse
the existing political regime.

15:46.980 --> 15:50.780
I have never seen
such concentration of testosterone

15:50.860 --> 15:55.300
as at Mykhaylivs'ka Square
on November 30th,

15:55.380 --> 15:59.300
when strong men came out to declare

15:59.380 --> 16:05.100
that no one will ever
hurt children in this country.

16:05.180 --> 16:11.540
Shame! Shame!

16:11.620 --> 16:15.460
No bruise will be forgotten!

16:16.380 --> 16:21.060
No beating must be forgotten!

16:22.980 --> 16:27.140
All together, we are strong!

16:29.340 --> 16:32.700
We have to organize
a nationwide strike,

16:32.780 --> 16:37.620
and deprive the government
the right to perform any actions!

16:37.700 --> 16:40.140
Enough! Take action!

16:41.380 --> 16:44.260
Kyiv, stand up!

16:44.340 --> 16:48.380
Everyone realized that if today
students are beaten,

16:48.460 --> 16:50.380
tomorrow, anyone can be beaten as well.

16:51.700 --> 16:56.740
From that came
the "March of the Millions."

17:07.260 --> 17:12.780
Such rallies of a million people
were our hope to be heard.

17:12.859 --> 17:16.380
To Maidan!

17:18.420 --> 17:22.540
There were people
with baby strollers, elders,

17:22.619 --> 17:25.819
disabled people on crutches...
It was amazing!

17:25.900 --> 17:29.100
We realized that
we could change something.

17:31.820 --> 17:34.700
WE ARE AGAINST
THE POLICE STATE

17:38.660 --> 17:41.060
ONLY A COWARD CAN HURT A CHILD

17:41.140 --> 17:47.660
They give us corruption!
We give them revolution!

17:48.580 --> 17:53.380
Everyday people, teachers,
doctors, street cleaners,

17:53.460 --> 17:58.260
everyone, the whole country said,
"This must stop!"

17:59.860 --> 18:03.620
I'd like all of us to remember
that there are two European values:

18:03.700 --> 18:07.860
freedom and human dignity.

18:07.940 --> 18:12.740
And no one can deprive us of them.

18:12.820 --> 18:17.420
These are fundamental rights
that we must fight for.

18:17.500 --> 18:21.700
Today all of us are here,
regardless of our political views,

18:21.780 --> 18:25.180
people from different cities,
from all over Ukraine,

18:25.260 --> 18:27.340
speaking different languages.

18:27.420 --> 18:31.140
We all came here to fight for one thing:
for our freedom, our dignity.

18:31.220 --> 18:33.420
Ukraine, we are all together!

18:38.620 --> 18:43.500
One million people,
outraged by such barbaric cruelty.

18:43.580 --> 18:48.380
They showed the government
must not enrage the nation.

18:48.460 --> 18:50.980
This inspired me very much.

18:51.060 --> 18:54.140
Our people are not without rights
and they are not cowards.

18:54.220 --> 18:56.380
Brothers and sisters!

18:56.460 --> 19:02.220
Yanukovych and his gang
raised a hand against our children!

19:02.300 --> 19:06.780
He thought we would
be scared and hide!

19:08.780 --> 19:12.620
Many of us were feeling very angry.

19:16.060 --> 19:20.180
My friends said they were
going to Bankova Street,

19:20.260 --> 19:22.900
because they wanted revenge
for the beatings of the girls.

19:36.140 --> 19:38.300
All of them were so furious
about what happened.

19:38.380 --> 19:41.180
I could see anger
in their faces and acts.

19:41.260 --> 19:43.740
And everyone seriously thought

19:43.820 --> 19:47.460
that the presidential headquarters
could be seized.

19:51.620 --> 19:56.100
In the front lines
there were people wearing masks,

19:56.980 --> 19:59.540
but as far as I could see,

19:59.620 --> 20:02.740
there were average boys and girls
standing in the crowd behind.

20:02.820 --> 20:06.100
Police with the people!

20:06.180 --> 20:09.100
No aggression!
Only peaceful protest!

20:10.060 --> 20:13.140
We have beautiful people here
who want change,

20:13.220 --> 20:15.620
but let's get real, we are outnumbered!

20:15.700 --> 20:20.620
If we want revolution to happen,
we need to involve them, not hit them!

20:22.180 --> 20:27.220
There were provocateurs there
planted by the Berkut.

20:29.380 --> 20:34.740
To give them a reason
to storm and beat everyone.

20:51.820 --> 20:55.100
The police threw stun grenades,

20:55.180 --> 20:58.820
and dispersed tear gas into the crowd.

21:44.420 --> 21:49.420
One of the Berkut policemen
ran to me and hit my leg.

21:49.500 --> 21:54.380
It hurt so much,
I couldn't walk or even stand.

22:24.100 --> 22:27.540
Some of the Red Cross medical workers
pushed me into the nearest house

22:27.620 --> 22:29.420
and protected me with their backs.

22:29.500 --> 22:32.540
Berkut beat up all these guys.

22:32.620 --> 22:36.580
They shielded me
with their backs and saved me.

22:46.060 --> 22:49.500
My friend was beaten
much more than the others

22:49.580 --> 22:51.740
while he was lying on the ground.

22:53.380 --> 22:55.620
He is indifferent to politics.

22:55.700 --> 22:59.260
He is an average man...

22:59.340 --> 23:02.300
like most of us who were
standing on the Maidan.

23:02.380 --> 23:05.460
Call the ambulance!
We can't help him.

23:08.220 --> 23:10.820
I have only one question: Why?

23:10.900 --> 23:15.060
Aren't you Ukrainian too?

23:34.700 --> 23:37.020
We need a doctor!

24:10.700 --> 24:17.100
People of Maidan asked officers
in reserve for help.

24:20.420 --> 24:27.260
We gathered, moved to Maidan
and started to construct barricades.

24:32.220 --> 24:34.860
What was good about Maidan
was self-organization.

24:36.820 --> 24:40.460
Everyone knew what they needed to do,
and they did it on their own.

24:46.900 --> 24:48.700
KYIV CITY
STATE ADMINISTRATION

24:48.780 --> 24:52.220
Protesters occupied the
Kyiv City State Administration Building.

24:52.300 --> 24:57.020
It was a radical act
that formed the new face of Maidan.

25:20.860 --> 25:23.980
THE NATION IS INVINCIBLE

25:51.340 --> 25:55.260
I began providing food
for people on Maidan.

25:55.340 --> 25:59.140
I found out what they needed,
warm clothes, hats, blankets...

26:01.620 --> 26:04.140
I was shocked how people
stood in the street

26:04.220 --> 26:07.380
despite such cold weather all this time.

26:07.460 --> 26:11.820
I admire the courage of these people.

26:14.100 --> 26:16.340
I was on Maidan from the beginning.

26:16.420 --> 26:22.300
I saw how the students were
staying here in Maidan,

26:24.060 --> 26:29.540
I was worried about them,
and live not too far from here.

26:32.780 --> 26:35.900
It was a spontaneous idea,

26:35.980 --> 26:41.100
to stay in Maidan
until everybody hears you.

26:42.340 --> 26:45.020
Until the world hears you.

26:47.540 --> 26:54.220
We are a European nation
and we will fight for our future!

27:00.460 --> 27:03.060
I'm asking you one more time,
I'm begging you,

27:03.140 --> 27:08.980
don't carry out the orders of
Convict Yanukovych.

27:09.060 --> 27:12.420
Come to the side of your nation!

27:12.500 --> 27:15.420
Come to the side of your nation!

27:33.620 --> 27:37.620
During the negotiations,
while the whole world was watching

27:37.700 --> 27:42.340
how a free Ukrainian nation
will overcome this situation,

27:42.420 --> 27:44.580
the government decided to act

27:44.660 --> 27:50.500
in the most disgraceful
and sneaky way ever.

27:55.500 --> 28:00.820
The Berkut showed up
and surrounded Maidan.

28:00.900 --> 28:04.420
They wanted to clear Maidan.

28:06.740 --> 28:09.420
They had shields,
helmets and body armor,

28:09.500 --> 28:11.980
while we were unarmed.

28:14.220 --> 28:16.940
Those who gave the command,

28:17.020 --> 28:20.460
don't commit the greatest crime
in the country's history.

28:20.540 --> 28:23.140
Don't do this, please!

28:29.420 --> 28:32.780
Shame! Shame!

28:46.300 --> 28:50.540
All the women were sent to the stage,
so they wouldn't get hurt,

28:51.540 --> 28:56.260
while the men somehow
tried to hold off the Berkut.

28:59.740 --> 29:02.260
We were standing hand in hand...

29:02.340 --> 29:05.900
and didn't know
what would happen next.

29:05.980 --> 29:08.300
We just hoped for the best.

29:08.380 --> 29:10.700
We couldn't allow any provocation.

29:13.620 --> 29:16.740
On the count of one,
they started pushing us.

29:16.820 --> 29:19.580
We felt like we were squeezed.

29:19.660 --> 29:21.860
The pressure of Berkut was so huge

29:21.940 --> 29:25.860
it started to break up
the hand-chain of the Maidan protesters.

29:37.540 --> 29:41.460
I started singing the anthem,
even though it was hard.

29:46.300 --> 29:48.740
But when you hear it,

29:51.580 --> 29:54.660
your hands become stronger.

29:57.900 --> 30:01.180
It wasn't fear, but apprehension.

30:01.260 --> 30:03.060
"What if they manage to break us up?"

30:03.140 --> 30:06.940
We weren't afraid of being hurt.

30:07.020 --> 30:11.460
We were afraid that the idea
of Maidan would be extinguished.

30:20.860 --> 30:23.980
People called me at 1:30 a.m.

30:24.060 --> 30:27.980
I was getting so many calls.

30:28.060 --> 30:30.420
I realized I had to act.

30:30.500 --> 30:34.180
So with Bishop Agapit's blessing,

30:34.260 --> 30:37.700
my friends and I started
ringing all the bells.

30:37.780 --> 30:43.060
Today, December 11th, 2013,

30:43.140 --> 30:47.100
they are trying to wipe out Maidan.

30:47.180 --> 30:53.900
Mykhalyvs'kyi Monastery is doing
something in order to prevent that.

30:55.420 --> 30:58.820
The last time Mykhalyvs'kyi Monastery
rang all the bells...

31:01.020 --> 31:05.420
was in 1240
when the Mongol-Tatars invaded Kyiv.

31:13.500 --> 31:15.260
I was afraid that people
would only know

31:15.340 --> 31:18.460
about what had happened
from the morning TV news again.

31:18.540 --> 31:21.340
Then I saw my friends arriving,

31:21.420 --> 31:25.340
leaving their cars in the street
and running.

31:25.420 --> 31:28.620
When people were going
to Maidan on foot,

31:30.060 --> 31:31.460
no one could stop it!

31:36.780 --> 31:39.500
Lots of drivers picked up people
far from the city center

31:39.580 --> 31:42.420
and brought them to Maidan.

31:46.620 --> 31:49.500
More and more Kyiv citizens came.
Finally, there were about 15,000 of us.

31:51.180 --> 31:52.740
So the Berkut couldn't do anything.

31:59.900 --> 32:03.660
That night of December 11th

32:03.740 --> 32:06.620
showed how important
the spirit of unity is.

32:53.700 --> 32:58.500
It didn't matter anymore
how much money and efforts

32:58.580 --> 33:03.420
would be needed
to achieve the aim.

33:05.940 --> 33:10.020
The point was human dignity.

33:15.020 --> 33:17.260
-Glory to Ukraine!
-Glory to the heroes!

33:19.860 --> 33:25.260
Maidan taught Ukrainian youth
how to organize ourselves.

33:28.180 --> 33:32.580
Now we know that our plans
might become real.

33:32.660 --> 33:37.740
We can change this country on our own.

33:43.380 --> 33:45.860
We just took bags
and filled them with snow and water.

33:45.940 --> 33:48.860
We used them to build
robust constructions.

33:48.940 --> 33:55.780
Even when it got warmer,
the barricades didn't melt at once.

33:55.860 --> 33:57.860
Finally, they became
our solid foundations.

34:03.500 --> 34:07.060
We found welding materials,
rods and welded spike strips.

34:07.140 --> 34:11.900
We made more massive
and durable constructions.

34:19.620 --> 34:20.940
When people saw these barricades,

34:21.020 --> 34:26.780
they said they looked like historical
barricades from the 16th century.

34:27.739 --> 34:32.940
So why wouldn't we use
the laws, rules,

34:33.020 --> 34:37.540
and hierarchy of our ancestors?

34:39.659 --> 34:43.260
This brought about the creation
of Maidan Defense Units.

34:43.340 --> 34:48.060
Some Maidan Defense Units were named
after the home towns of its participants.

34:48.139 --> 34:49.659
WE ARE FORMING A WOMEN'S
RAPID REACTION UNIT

34:52.860 --> 34:56.179
People came to Maidan to win.

34:56.260 --> 34:59.180
This was a people's army...

34:59.260 --> 35:02.140
and of course,
I came to train this army.

35:03.060 --> 35:07.620
I taught them how to resist the attacks

35:07.700 --> 35:10.380
of these monsters in uniforms.

35:12.940 --> 35:16.100
We began to gather and train
how to behave correctly,

35:16.180 --> 35:20.300
how to defend ourselves
and our friends,

35:20.380 --> 35:23.620
how to control our emotions
not to provoke others,

35:23.700 --> 35:27.140
and how to act legally
in tense situations.

35:31.300 --> 35:34.700
We were patrolling
the perimeter of Maidan,

35:34.780 --> 35:36.700
guarding and defending people.

35:36.780 --> 35:39.660
We were doing our best to keep order.

35:41.100 --> 35:45.300
There was not even a single bottle
of beer on Maidan and it's a fact.

35:47.220 --> 35:51.180
The activists of Maidan
were people who stood here,

35:52.020 --> 35:55.580
while the activists of AutoMaidan
were the car owners.

35:57.060 --> 36:03.340
They were like an outer circle,
the cavalry of Maidan.

36:11.380 --> 36:12.940
It was my school.

36:13.620 --> 36:17.900
I never went to school before.

36:17.980 --> 36:20.540
But I am staying here in Maidan.

36:21.380 --> 36:23.980
I volunteered in the tech tent.

36:24.740 --> 36:27.460
I was charging phones
and helping people,

36:27.540 --> 36:33.540
and helping people use the Internet
so they can connect with their families.

36:35.020 --> 36:38.020
President Yanukovych
entered into an agreement with Russia

36:38.100 --> 36:42.260
and by doing so he distanced
the country even further from the EU.

36:47.700 --> 36:49.460
I'm against Yanukovych.

36:49.540 --> 36:52.140
He's not good for us as a president.

36:52.220 --> 36:55.420
His Berkut beat a woman
in front of my eyes.

36:57.460 --> 37:01.020
They beat girls, they beat boys.
They even beat me.

37:01.740 --> 37:06.140
When I came here, I found many friends.

37:07.340 --> 37:09.540
All of them are like my brothers.

37:10.620 --> 37:13.980
I started writing stories
on my Facebook page

37:14.060 --> 37:16.500
about people who came to Maidan.

37:16.580 --> 37:19.260
I'd like to write a story about you.

37:19.340 --> 37:22.380
-Really? Where have you seen me?
-I see you here every day.

37:23.180 --> 37:25.380
I communicated with Serhiy Nigoyan,

37:25.460 --> 37:28.860
I was writing a story about him
and where he came from.

37:28.940 --> 37:32.220
That girl has drawn my portrait?

37:32.300 --> 37:37.260
I'm supposed to live in this country.
This is my future, why I stay here.

37:37.340 --> 37:40.180
All of us, we are one.

37:40.260 --> 37:42.260
Brother for brother,
neighbor for neighbor.

37:45.700 --> 37:50.260
In Maidan, we didn't have nationalities,
we didn't have language groups...

37:51.420 --> 37:57.260
It was only people
who didn't want to live with the regime.

38:07.620 --> 38:09.340
From the very beginning,

38:09.420 --> 38:12.580
the representatives
of all religions were on Maidan,

38:12.660 --> 38:15.100
as the "Men of Prayer."

38:18.460 --> 38:21.460
We tried to help people of all means,

38:21.540 --> 38:25.460
not only by prayer,
we communicated with people.

38:26.340 --> 38:29.940
We tried to put their hearts
into what they were doing,

38:30.020 --> 38:33.380
and keep their faith.

38:33.460 --> 38:37.100
We supported people
in their aspirations,

38:37.180 --> 38:41.940
concerning not only their future,
but also the future of our state.

38:44.620 --> 38:50.940
Different religions came together
without conflict,

38:51.020 --> 38:55.420
in order to achieve one mutual
and important goal.

39:02.020 --> 39:06.220
You know, when people were singing
the national anthem every three hours,

39:06.300 --> 39:10.780
I had a feeling
that it became a prayer.

39:37.180 --> 39:40.620
-Glory to Ukraine!
-Glory to the heroes!

39:44.540 --> 39:48.900
-Glory to Ukraine!
-Glory to the heroes!

39:49.540 --> 39:53.140
Happy New Year, Ukraine!

40:08.260 --> 40:10.620
Instead of conducting negotiations,

40:10.700 --> 40:16.660
the government chose to unleash
a bacchanalia of dictatorship.

40:16.740 --> 40:18.980
Vote by raising your hands.

40:20.620 --> 40:23.500
We live in the 21st century
in a civilized country,

40:23.580 --> 40:25.700
and our lawmakers in the parliament
vote by raising hands?

40:25.780 --> 40:29.700
What a show! Come on!
What are you doing, guys?

40:29.780 --> 40:33.380
You vote and adopt
a series of stupid, tyrannical laws!

40:33.460 --> 40:35.780
It's absurd!

40:42.940 --> 40:46.500
According to these laws, you can't
wear motorcycle helmets and hard hats,

40:46.580 --> 40:48.860
you can't drive
a group of 5 cars at once,

40:48.940 --> 40:51.860
even at weddings and funerals...

40:59.700 --> 41:03.260
I found my ski helmet
and an old camouflage jacket

41:03.340 --> 41:05.660
and wore them to work.

41:05.740 --> 41:08.340
I told them,
"You can arrest me any time".

41:09.220 --> 41:15.420
People were wearing pots,
diving masks and flippers.

41:15.500 --> 41:18.260
They took anything they could find.

41:18.340 --> 41:21.340
You see a lot of people
wearing kitchen pots.

41:21.420 --> 41:27.580
They forgot to put that in these laws.
They should add that immediately.

41:28.940 --> 41:32.020
The people interpreted it
with such irony and defiance.

41:32.100 --> 41:36.340
Every 20th person showed the government

41:36.420 --> 41:42.700
how pissed off they were
with these so-called "laws".

41:44.900 --> 41:50.580
The catalyst were the laws
passed on January 16th.

41:51.540 --> 41:55.260
That weekend we had a veche.

41:55.340 --> 41:58.940
Every weekend we had a veche,
a meeting of the people in Maidan.

42:00.020 --> 42:03.980
It's already been two months
and no results!

42:04.060 --> 42:09.420
This is the 9th veche,
and we need a concrete plan!

42:09.500 --> 42:12.220
On Sunday, the opposition
leaders came out to the stage,

42:12.300 --> 42:15.100
but hadn't said anything worthwhile again.

42:15.180 --> 42:18.660
Shame!

42:18.740 --> 42:21.780
People were so disappointed
by their lack of action,

42:21.860 --> 42:24.580
they decided to tell
these politicians where to get off.

42:25.540 --> 42:28.220
I'm one of you.

42:28.300 --> 42:32.700
Everyone knows about AutoMaidan
and what we are doing for Ukraine.

42:32.780 --> 42:34.940
We are standing by your side.

42:35.020 --> 42:39.060
We'll march peacefully to the Parliament,

42:39.140 --> 42:43.340
and we'll stand there
as long as it takes.

42:43.420 --> 42:45.580
Those who agree, raise your hands!

42:46.740 --> 42:47.780
Thank you!

42:47.860 --> 42:51.460
I'm calling to all lawmakers of Ukraine.

42:51.540 --> 42:54.220
You are chosen by the people!

42:54.300 --> 42:59.500
Each of you must come to the Parliament

42:59.580 --> 43:01.940
and cancel these shameful laws!

43:02.020 --> 43:04.980
Otherwise tomorrow,
we'll be arrested and thrown in jail!

43:05.060 --> 43:08.860
For what?
For expressing our civil rights?

43:30.500 --> 43:34.420
For 30 minutes we were trying
to persuade the police to back down,

43:34.500 --> 43:36.300
and let us approach
the Parliament peacefully.

43:36.380 --> 43:37.980
That's it.

43:38.060 --> 43:41.140
They responded by cursing at us.

43:44.100 --> 43:47.220
I appeal to the police.

43:47.300 --> 43:51.980
You gave an oath to serve
the Ukrainian nation,

43:52.060 --> 43:54.660
not to Yanukovych and his gang!

43:54.740 --> 43:59.140
Free the way for peaceful citizens!

44:00.220 --> 44:02.860
While standing in the right flank,

44:02.940 --> 44:06.820
we tried to find a compromise
with the Internal Troops peacefully.

44:06.900 --> 44:10.460
Turmoil began in the left flank.

44:12.340 --> 44:16.460
Vitali Klitschko and other opposition
party leaders tried to pacify the crowd,

44:16.540 --> 44:18.980
but the protesters didn't listen to them.

44:25.100 --> 44:27.020
At this point they had
no authority or influence anymore.

44:27.100 --> 44:28.860
People were disillusioned

44:28.940 --> 44:31.940
by their inability to
take real responsibility for something.

44:40.100 --> 44:43.620
There, on Hrushevskogo,
everyone's patience ran out.

44:43.700 --> 44:46.540
In what country in the world would people
be able to live with these laws?

44:46.620 --> 44:48.580
It's easier to go directly to prison.

45:05.300 --> 45:07.300
Can you imagine?

45:07.380 --> 45:10.700
Infuriating people to such despair

45:10.780 --> 45:16.060
that a banker and one of the most
influential attorneys from Lviv

45:16.140 --> 45:18.540
came to Hrushevskogo Street
to throw stones at the police.

45:54.180 --> 45:58.020
Strategically our position on
Hrushevskogo Street was very unfavorable.

45:58.100 --> 46:00.500
But it was a perfect vantage-ground
for the Internal Troops.

46:01.260 --> 46:03.380
They started shooting at us
with rubber bullets.

46:04.100 --> 46:08.540
They also attached bolts and screws
to stun grenades,

46:08.620 --> 46:12.100
so they caused
as much damage as possible.

46:20.220 --> 46:24.820
The Ukrainian people
will determine who's in charge.

46:24.900 --> 46:27.820
We chose this president,
and we can take him out.

46:34.900 --> 46:36.660
People were not afraid here.

46:36.740 --> 46:41.900
It was more frightening to watch
all of these events on TV,

46:41.980 --> 46:44.700
than to come here to participate in them.

46:59.820 --> 47:04.620
From here, we were throwing
Molotov cocktails and stones.

47:12.260 --> 47:16.300
Take gas, machine oil and saltpeter,

47:16.380 --> 47:18.940
mix it together and shake well.

47:19.020 --> 47:21.980
Take a cloth rag and make a wick,

47:22.060 --> 47:24.380
light it up and throw.

47:30.340 --> 47:33.020
Convict out!

47:54.420 --> 47:59.380
Mostly here we were burning tires,

47:59.460 --> 48:06.180
so the fire could keep
the Berkut from attacking us.

48:17.940 --> 48:21.140
After several days of hard resistance,

48:22.500 --> 48:25.860
people were very exhausted.

48:26.580 --> 48:30.260
-Glory to Ukraine!
-Glory to the heroes!

48:33.420 --> 48:38.860
And at sunrise,
when everyone was extremely tired,

48:38.940 --> 48:41.100
Berkut realized...

48:41.180 --> 48:45.140
"It's the right moment to attack.
Let's clean up this place."

49:08.180 --> 49:10.580
People on our side
were disorganized and confused.

49:10.660 --> 49:14.540
Protesters and civilians
mixed with policemen,

49:14.620 --> 49:18.340
mixed with the soldiers,
a chaotic jumble.

49:27.940 --> 49:30.380
When they attack people,
the police went first,

49:30.460 --> 49:33.100
behind them were the Berkut
followed by the Titushky.

49:36.580 --> 49:39.620
Titushky are hired thugs,
who have no dignity or conscience.

49:39.700 --> 49:41.260
They sold themselves out for money.

49:41.340 --> 49:47.220
Many of them were released from prison,

49:47.300 --> 49:53.060
criminals that were hired to do this job.

49:55.420 --> 49:57.180
We're here for an idea.

49:57.260 --> 49:59.460
You're standing here
in the cold for an idea?

49:59.540 --> 50:01.660
We want to keep order in Ukraine.

50:02.940 --> 50:05.620
Titushky...
they don't have principles.

50:05.700 --> 50:07.660
For less than ten bucks,

50:07.740 --> 50:11.300
they are willing to not only wave a flag,
but also to kill.

50:12.580 --> 50:14.820
Titushky love only money.

50:14.900 --> 50:17.700
They betrayed the Ukrainian nation.

50:18.620 --> 50:22.780
Titushky were standing behind me,
waiting for the right moment,

50:22.860 --> 50:25.300
and they knocked me to the ground.

50:25.380 --> 50:29.500
After that, some Berkut
ran up to me and I got captured.

50:33.860 --> 50:35.700
Bring him back!

50:35.780 --> 50:37.580
Bring him fucking back!

50:45.900 --> 50:50.340
They tried to dishonor him,
but instead dishonored themselves.

50:53.580 --> 50:57.740
He stood with his head held high.
He behaved with dignity.

51:01.580 --> 51:05.100
It caused a great
emotional outburst among people.

51:14.940 --> 51:18.020
People were standing
15 feet from a Berkut policeman,

51:18.100 --> 51:20.580
and he was shooting without stopping.

51:22.340 --> 51:25.900
But people took sticks
and started attacking him.

51:34.260 --> 51:36.940
The troops were shooting
directly at the Red Cross signs.

51:37.020 --> 51:39.340
Don't shoot!

51:39.420 --> 51:42.820
-Where is that wounded guy?
-Get away!

51:42.900 --> 51:45.060
I'm a doctor!

51:46.900 --> 51:49.660
I'm just a doctor!
I mean you no harm!

51:50.820 --> 51:55.340
I showed him the sign of the Red Cross,
but he shot my leg.

51:59.100 --> 52:02.580
The first victims with
wounded eyes appeared that day.

52:09.260 --> 52:12.180
When we brought in the third man
with no eyes...

52:12.260 --> 52:16.500
I came outside and
had a panic attack.

52:24.380 --> 52:25.740
FIRST AID

52:25.820 --> 52:28.180
The first improvised
medical aid station

52:28.260 --> 52:31.380
was located near
a sushi restaurant.

52:31.460 --> 52:35.220
People brought bottles
with drinking water,

52:35.300 --> 52:38.420
lemons, vinegar...

52:38.500 --> 52:42.220
Anything they thought
could help with tear gas.

52:42.300 --> 52:44.660
In the morning,
when Berkut attacked,

52:44.740 --> 52:50.300
they completely destroyed
that medical station.

52:51.380 --> 52:55.180
You bastards!
Don't touch the medicine!

52:59.740 --> 53:02.740
They threw stun grenades inside
and sprayed tear gas.

53:02.820 --> 53:05.700
We had to run away.
All the medicine was left behind.

53:05.780 --> 53:09.580
We couldn't even imagine that
something like this could happen.

53:13.540 --> 53:18.580
Among the rubber bullets
that were distributed to Berkut,

53:19.740 --> 53:24.300
it seems someone substituted them
with live ammunition on purpose.

53:35.340 --> 53:37.940
It was scary, to be honest with you,

53:38.900 --> 53:41.380
when they started to shoot people
with real bullets.

53:44.460 --> 53:48.500
You hear the sound of
a bullet passing your head,

53:48.580 --> 53:50.980
and see people dropping dead.

53:55.660 --> 53:58.380
I want to ask them
who gave birth to you?

53:58.460 --> 54:01.180
A mother or a wolf?

54:01.260 --> 54:04.900
How could this happen?
Against your own people?

54:11.260 --> 54:15.100
One of the most horrible moments
I've seen was on Hrushevskogo Street,

54:15.180 --> 54:18.220
when the Berkut shot Serhiy Nigoyan.

54:31.900 --> 54:35.700
How could such a good person be killed?

54:35.780 --> 54:39.140
He was so young and had
his whole life ahead of him.

54:42.580 --> 54:47.700
Everyone who knew Serhiy
always said the same thing about him,

54:47.780 --> 54:52.900
how pure, how beautiful
and how open this human being was.

55:25.100 --> 55:28.260
We still can't believe he's gone.
We wait...

55:29.620 --> 55:34.060
I'm here and I keep thinking that
he is up there on Hrushevskogo Street.

55:34.140 --> 55:35.900
I can't believe...

55:43.300 --> 55:46.740
Those in power were banking that
Maidan would fall apart on its own,

55:46.820 --> 55:51.580
but after the events on Hrushevskogo,
and after the first deaths,

55:51.660 --> 55:54.180
Zhyznevskyi and Nigoyan...

56:00.820 --> 56:04.780
people decided to stay until the end.

56:05.740 --> 56:10.060
For us, it was the point of no return.

56:13.900 --> 56:15.340
I realized...

56:16.220 --> 56:19.180
that the time of this government
has come to an end.

56:19.260 --> 56:22.740
-Glory to Ukraine!
-Glory to the heroes!

56:22.820 --> 56:25.500
-Glory to the nation!
-Death to our enemies!

56:28.580 --> 56:30.660
The AutoMaidan is trapped.

56:30.740 --> 56:32.980
Tonight's main story is attacks
on the AutoMaidan Activists.

56:33.060 --> 56:34.100
ATTACKS ON AUTOMAIDAN

56:34.180 --> 56:36.820
Tonight they were
patrolling Kyiv streets

56:36.900 --> 56:39.460
and hospitals where wounded
activists were brought.

56:39.540 --> 56:41.940
But their cars were attacked

56:42.020 --> 56:45.420
and many activists were arrested
and kidnapped by Berkut.

56:52.820 --> 56:57.060
Our friends were missing,
so we went out to look for them...

56:57.140 --> 56:59.220
but on the way...

57:06.620 --> 57:10.100
It was a well-planned trap.

57:18.900 --> 57:23.300
Berkut and traffic police
participated in it.

57:23.380 --> 57:25.100
So we were captured.

57:25.180 --> 57:28.300
-What are you doing?
-This is my wife!

57:28.380 --> 57:31.940
We are just going home!

57:32.020 --> 57:34.780
What the hell are you doing?

57:35.900 --> 57:38.260
First, they smashed
and destroyed our car.

57:38.340 --> 57:40.740
Then they dragged us out
on the street and beat us.

57:40.820 --> 57:45.140
After that they put us in a bus
and took us to Mariyinsky Park...

57:45.220 --> 57:47.140
...where they released me.

57:48.300 --> 57:52.260
They were severely beating the men,
who were getting terribly injured.

57:53.620 --> 57:57.260
They were beating us to death.

57:57.340 --> 58:01.500
-Are you insane? Call the police!
-People are kidnapped here!

58:01.580 --> 58:05.540
-Don't block the road.
-Call the police! People are kidnapped!

58:07.500 --> 58:10.580
I thought I would never
see my friends alive.

58:10.660 --> 58:13.060
Considering how many people
were kidnapped and injured,

58:13.140 --> 58:17.540
at that point,
it was really scary.

58:32.540 --> 58:37.740
I just came from negotiations with
the President of Ukraine, Yanukovych.

58:38.980 --> 58:45.180
As of today, Berkut will stop
using force against activists.

58:46.100 --> 58:48.140
All kidnapped protesters
will be released.

58:49.420 --> 58:53.940
We don't believe it!

58:54.020 --> 58:59.180
I have no guarantee
these are not lies,

58:59.260 --> 59:02.740
we've been deceived many times...

59:02.820 --> 59:07.580
If we go home
we can be caught!

59:07.660 --> 59:13.820
They'll kill us one by one!
And nobody judges them!

59:13.900 --> 59:17.100
Why does the government
not judge its own crimes?

01:00:15.020 --> 01:00:19.220
When I went to do my regular
night security watch,

01:00:20.140 --> 01:00:25.420
my little daughter came to me,
and asked me not to go.

01:00:30.140 --> 01:00:33.060
"Poppa," she said, "I'll grow up...

01:00:34.260 --> 01:00:36.460
and bring them down myself."

01:00:36.540 --> 01:00:40.060
And I told her,

01:00:41.220 --> 01:00:47.380
"If we don't take them down now,
no one will ever be able to do it."

01:01:18.820 --> 01:01:21.500
Maidan started in November.

01:01:24.700 --> 01:01:29.620
It was able to survive through
many difficult events.

01:01:31.780 --> 01:01:37.140
But the moment came when the people
of Maidan formulated their own goals,

01:01:37.220 --> 01:01:40.260
as a set of specific political demands.

01:01:41.980 --> 01:01:44.780
The first thing we insisted on
was the release of political prisoners.

01:01:46.220 --> 01:01:49.900
The second one was
establishing equality of power

01:01:49.980 --> 01:01:53.100
between the parliament
and the president

01:01:53.180 --> 01:01:55.780
to establish well-balanced
branches of government.

01:01:55.860 --> 01:01:59.260
The third one was
early presidential re-elections.

01:01:59.340 --> 01:02:00.500
Those for this, raise your hand!

01:02:03.180 --> 01:02:05.340
Only under these three conditions

01:02:05.420 --> 01:02:10.620
could Maidan end in a peaceful way.

01:02:11.540 --> 01:02:15.380
These were our demands in February
and they were supposed to be discussed

01:02:15.460 --> 01:02:17.500
and approved by the parliament.

01:02:19.340 --> 01:02:22.980
On February 18th, a crowd of unarmed
people gathered to go to the Parliament.

01:02:23.620 --> 01:02:25.860
People without weapons or anything.

01:02:26.660 --> 01:02:29.980
A lot of patriots
responded to the call

01:02:30.060 --> 01:02:33.820
for a peaceful rally
to the parliament.

01:02:33.900 --> 01:02:39.380
We hope that our
representatives will hear us!

01:02:46.220 --> 01:02:50.900
We supposed that a peaceful protest
and rally to the parliament,

01:02:50.980 --> 01:02:54.100
supported by
a great number of people,

01:02:54.180 --> 01:02:59.300
would become a turning point,
and we would finally be heard.

01:03:13.860 --> 01:03:17.900
Waiting for us there were the police,

01:03:17.980 --> 01:03:21.460
Berkut, and Titushky.

01:03:22.060 --> 01:03:26.220
Remember when you were children,
you were taught to love Ukraine.

01:03:26.300 --> 01:03:29.100
Remember what your
first teachers told you.

01:03:49.660 --> 01:03:55.780
I didn't know how all this would end.
They just started killing us.

01:04:03.620 --> 01:04:07.100
Titushky that were in Mariyinsky Park
on February 18th

01:04:07.180 --> 01:04:09.860
were different than they were before.

01:04:09.940 --> 01:04:12.340
They were well trained
and organized.

01:04:13.420 --> 01:04:14.980
It was a well-planned action.

01:04:17.780 --> 01:04:20.500
Titushky were allowed to do
things that the policemen weren't.

01:04:20.580 --> 01:04:23.780
Come on, finish him!

01:04:26.860 --> 01:04:29.100
They behaved like animals.

01:04:44.540 --> 01:04:48.180
When we saw black clouds of smoke
rise over Hrushevskogo Street,

01:04:48.260 --> 01:04:51.500
and we realized tires were
burning on Instytutska Street,

01:04:52.740 --> 01:04:54.700
we went there.

01:05:21.140 --> 01:05:25.900
At the intersection of
Instytutska and Shelkovichna Street,

01:05:27.020 --> 01:05:28.940
Berkut shot at people from rooftops.

01:05:43.260 --> 01:05:46.620
They swore an oath
to serve the Ukrainian nation

01:05:46.700 --> 01:05:50.300
but they wound up serving others.
Very bad people.

01:05:51.020 --> 01:05:54.180
They got used to living a vile and
nasty life and so they do vile things.

01:05:54.260 --> 01:05:56.100
They were rotten.

01:06:02.820 --> 01:06:04.940
Berkut were throwing bricks at us.

01:06:05.020 --> 01:06:08.380
They had no mercy.
Neither did we.

01:06:17.500 --> 01:06:21.420
It wasn't like a fictional show
we watch on TV.

01:06:21.500 --> 01:06:23.740
It was a shocking reality we faced.

01:06:37.740 --> 01:06:40.180
Call the ambulance!
Hold his legs!

01:06:46.540 --> 01:06:49.500
Call the ambulance, quick!

01:06:52.740 --> 01:06:56.340
Since Berkut had guns and grenades,

01:06:56.420 --> 01:06:59.700
and we challenged them
without firearms,

01:06:59.780 --> 01:07:02.860
we had to retreat back to Maidan.

01:07:51.820 --> 01:07:57.860
They occupied top positions,
the October Palace and the footbridge.

01:07:57.940 --> 01:08:01.860
They had perfect firing positions.

01:08:04.420 --> 01:08:07.220
Knowing military tactics,
I realized that we were trapped.

01:08:08.620 --> 01:08:14.100
You are fighting against
your own brothers and sisters!

01:08:31.300 --> 01:08:35.140
In that critical moment on Maidan,

01:08:35.220 --> 01:08:38.700
behind the people forming a barricade,

01:08:38.779 --> 01:08:41.660
people were on their knees
praying with rosary beads.

01:08:42.779 --> 01:08:45.100
These are your people!

01:08:45.740 --> 01:08:49.100
Don't follow these unlawful orders!

01:08:49.180 --> 01:08:55.420
Berkut started throwing
Molotov cocktails at us from over there.

01:08:59.380 --> 01:09:03.060
Our side didn't lose courage
and began throwing tires into the fire

01:09:03.140 --> 01:09:05.580
to make them choke from the smoke.

01:09:09.660 --> 01:09:12.220
The wind and a higher power
were on our side,

01:09:12.300 --> 01:09:16.140
and the smoke was
stifling them on the top.

01:09:24.180 --> 01:09:26.899
We have to stop them with fire!

01:09:26.979 --> 01:09:28.859
The fire is our shield!

01:09:33.979 --> 01:09:35.899
Many people were scared.

01:09:40.380 --> 01:09:43.540
But we still stood there.
Nobody ran away.

01:09:45.060 --> 01:09:48.340
I was shooting at them
with my slingshot.

01:09:48.420 --> 01:09:50.939
I hit a few of them.

01:10:02.420 --> 01:10:06.660
It was a dramatic and difficult night.

01:10:10.260 --> 01:10:12.860
People didn't talk.

01:10:12.940 --> 01:10:16.260
They just were looking
into each other's eyes,

01:10:16.340 --> 01:10:18.620
into each other's soul.

01:10:28.860 --> 01:10:32.220
I have never seen such courage.

01:10:32.780 --> 01:10:36.820
I was watching people and wondering,
"When will they run?"

01:10:39.780 --> 01:10:42.060
And I'd understand, if they did.

01:10:42.140 --> 01:10:43.820
But they didn't.

01:10:43.900 --> 01:10:45.580
They were fighting...

01:10:48.380 --> 01:10:50.820
They were fighting to the death.

01:10:50.900 --> 01:10:55.860
It might sound overstated, but at that
moment it looked exactly like that.

01:10:57.260 --> 01:10:59.500
People were fighting to the death.

01:10:59.580 --> 01:11:01.700
They were fighting for Ukraine.

01:11:20.340 --> 01:11:23.300
We were inside the Trade Union House
when it all started.

01:11:23.380 --> 01:11:24.780
They came from the top.

01:11:26.420 --> 01:11:29.580
The Trade Union House
was also used as a hospital,

01:11:29.660 --> 01:11:31.140
and there were lots of wounded.

01:11:32.580 --> 01:11:34.340
Today, as of now
there are about 20 dead

01:11:34.420 --> 01:11:36.220
and there are about 400 wounded.

01:11:36.300 --> 01:11:38.300
It's mass murder.

01:11:42.380 --> 01:11:48.500
The police and Berkut came and
started throwing flash grenades.

01:11:49.740 --> 01:11:53.420
They did everything
to burn this building down,

01:11:53.500 --> 01:11:55.420
because it was
the headquarters of the revolution.

01:12:00.700 --> 01:12:02.780
When the fire started,

01:12:02.860 --> 01:12:06.380
the biggest problem was
getting people out,

01:12:06.460 --> 01:12:08.820
especially those
who weren't able to walk.

01:12:08.900 --> 01:12:09.900
Hold on!

01:12:22.460 --> 01:12:28.020
Many people died in this building.

01:13:10.860 --> 01:13:14.620
Stop this action of killing people!

01:13:14.700 --> 01:13:18.660
Go back to your kids,
go back to your wives,

01:13:18.740 --> 01:13:21.540
go back to your families!

01:13:40.060 --> 01:13:43.420
During this time in February,

01:13:43.500 --> 01:13:47.460
Mykhaylivskyi Monastery once again

01:13:47.540 --> 01:13:51.380
became a sanctuary for people.

01:13:55.940 --> 01:13:58.660
At Mykhaylivskyi
we organized a hospital,

01:13:58.740 --> 01:14:02.220
and again, a kitchen and
warm clothes drop-off.

01:14:03.820 --> 01:14:08.860
I saw medical workers
from all over Ukraine,

01:14:08.940 --> 01:14:12.340
from Kyiv, Lviv, Vinnytsya...

01:14:12.420 --> 01:14:16.620
They were on duty 24/7
delivering medical care.

01:14:16.700 --> 01:14:19.660
They brought everything
they could and did their best.

01:14:23.260 --> 01:14:27.620
At first, only people from Kyiv
brought medicines and food,

01:14:27.700 --> 01:14:33.740
then cars started arriving from Rivne,
Cherkassy and other cities.

01:14:37.220 --> 01:14:40.300
Take that box.
There's Pantenol and painkillers.

01:14:43.420 --> 01:14:46.060
And in the backyard...

01:14:46.140 --> 01:14:47.220
a morgue.

01:14:51.140 --> 01:14:53.860
The information about
30 dead is almost confirmed.

01:14:53.940 --> 01:14:56.380
Unfortunately, we don't know
anything about victims

01:14:56.460 --> 01:14:59.780
taken away by the Berkut
from Mariyinsky Park.

01:15:30.700 --> 01:15:33.420
The tires were burning.

01:15:33.500 --> 01:15:38.820
People were gathering
but nobody took any decisive actions.

01:15:45.300 --> 01:15:49.180
I got expelled, but I came back
from another barricade and stayed.

01:15:49.260 --> 01:15:53.820
They thought I was
too young to be there.

01:16:00.060 --> 01:16:04.980
Some Berkut started to walk
on the burned ground.

01:16:07.340 --> 01:16:12.540
People started throwing bricks at them,

01:16:12.620 --> 01:16:15.100
when suddenly we heard
a burst of machine gun fire.

01:16:20.060 --> 01:16:21.980
It confused all of us.

01:16:23.580 --> 01:16:28.780
People thought that the Berkut
started shooting protesters,

01:16:28.860 --> 01:16:35.180
while the Internal Forces thought that
the protesters were armed and shooting.

01:16:35.260 --> 01:16:36.460
So they started to retreat.

01:16:40.300 --> 01:16:43.620
The Berkut stayed and opened fire.

01:16:51.860 --> 01:16:53.540
Take him to the medics!

01:16:54.460 --> 01:16:56.740
Doctor!

01:16:56.820 --> 01:16:58.180
Come on, let's carry him.

01:17:00.460 --> 01:17:03.260
When people were climbing up that hill,

01:17:03.340 --> 01:17:09.940
they realized that taking back this
territory would result in many casualties.

01:17:27.460 --> 01:17:29.820
The shooting started over there.

01:17:29.900 --> 01:17:31.980
There were concrete blocks
that Berkut used

01:17:32.060 --> 01:17:34.620
as a shield and to shoot from.

01:17:39.540 --> 01:17:43.780
He's injured, get him out of here!

01:17:45.260 --> 01:17:46.740
Cover him!

01:17:48.220 --> 01:17:50.020
Hold on!

01:18:03.420 --> 01:18:06.780
Guys! Help!

01:18:21.540 --> 01:18:25.300
They were shooting
and killing our people...

01:18:25.380 --> 01:18:28.980
but we knew we couldn't retreat.

01:18:29.060 --> 01:18:34.220
We had to bring it all to an end.

01:18:59.780 --> 01:19:05.060
You can see the bullet holes left here.

01:19:05.140 --> 01:19:09.700
You don't need to be a genius
to understand where the shots came from.

01:19:16.260 --> 01:19:18.660
We are not afraid to die for freedom.

01:19:18.740 --> 01:19:21.500
Freedom is for us.
Freedom is ours.

01:19:21.580 --> 01:19:24.500
We will win,
and Ukraine will be part of Europe,

01:19:24.580 --> 01:19:27.660
and Ukraine will be
part of the free world!

01:19:27.740 --> 01:19:30.860
And we'll never be slaves.
We will be free.

01:19:37.540 --> 01:19:43.380
A friend of mine died here,
Vitya Chmilenko.

01:19:43.460 --> 01:19:48.660
He ran up Instytutska Street
with a stretcher to bring out the wounded.

01:19:49.900 --> 01:19:53.820
He bent toward a wounded man
and then he got shot.

01:20:15.500 --> 01:20:17.300
I have no words...

01:20:17.380 --> 01:20:22.340
What kind of mother raised a man
to purposely target a person

01:20:22.420 --> 01:20:26.940
just trying to help
his wounded friend?

01:20:34.300 --> 01:20:36.500
They were even shooting priests.

01:20:38.540 --> 01:20:41.940
These killers hold nothing sacred.

01:20:42.020 --> 01:20:43.940
They can just as easily kill a holy man

01:20:44.020 --> 01:20:49.260
the same as everyone else
they killed on Maidan.

01:20:54.940 --> 01:20:58.620
The sniper attack
showed such depravity.

01:20:59.580 --> 01:21:01.900
It was...

01:21:01.980 --> 01:21:05.260
pure hatred...

01:21:05.340 --> 01:21:06.540
of your own brothers.

01:21:06.620 --> 01:21:12.100
We have to bring out and
carry some wounded, at least two!

01:21:14.900 --> 01:21:17.740
They were going with these
wooden shields under the bullets

01:21:17.820 --> 01:21:20.460
and didn't realize
that it was heroism.

01:21:23.700 --> 01:21:26.900
I tried to persuade them
not to do this,

01:21:27.820 --> 01:21:29.780
because they might be killed.

01:21:29.860 --> 01:21:32.660
They answered,
"We came here to die."

01:21:33.660 --> 01:21:36.860
They were driven
to make this country better,

01:21:36.940 --> 01:21:39.940
so they were willing
to go under the bullets,

01:21:40.020 --> 01:21:44.300
understanding they might die,
and not come back.

01:21:45.900 --> 01:21:52.620
I'm on the front line
at Instytutska Street.

01:21:56.140 --> 01:21:57.900
I can't hear you.

01:22:02.060 --> 01:22:05.340
Say something to Mom.

01:22:05.940 --> 01:22:09.780
Hi, I just woke up.

01:22:10.820 --> 01:22:14.140
In short, Moysey Vasyl Mykhailovych.

01:22:15.380 --> 01:22:17.180
Moysey Vasyl Mykhailovych.

01:22:17.260 --> 01:22:19.700
Tell her that you love her.

01:22:19.780 --> 01:22:23.580
Mom, I want to tell you something...

01:22:23.660 --> 01:22:26.580
Mom, I want you to know...

01:22:31.260 --> 01:22:33.380
Mom...

01:22:33.460 --> 01:22:35.180
I love you.

01:23:05.380 --> 01:23:07.220
You know what was
the most difficult thing?

01:23:07.300 --> 01:23:10.060
To decide to admit
that a person is dead.

01:23:13.900 --> 01:23:16.820
There are things that
I hate myself for...

01:23:17.860 --> 01:23:20.500
When you resuscitate one...

01:23:21.180 --> 01:23:24.580
and people continue bringing
more and more victims...

01:23:24.660 --> 01:23:28.540
you understand that
you might save that one,

01:23:29.180 --> 01:23:31.700
but the others can be lost.

01:23:31.780 --> 01:23:34.780
Bullet wounds are life-threatening.

01:23:37.980 --> 01:23:42.740
You close someone's eyes and make
a decision to stop resuscitating him.

01:23:42.820 --> 01:23:45.220
Then you move to the next victim.

01:23:47.180 --> 01:23:51.820
Having to decide who was already dead,
that was the hardest thing.

01:24:36.380 --> 01:24:39.260
-Glory to Ukraine!
-Glory to the heroes!

01:24:39.340 --> 01:24:44.500
-Glory to the nation!
-Death to our enemies!

01:24:44.580 --> 01:24:47.220
-Ukraine!
-Above all!

01:25:23.940 --> 01:25:28.940
I can't accept...

01:25:30.300 --> 01:25:35.500
after all the wars we've had in the world,

01:25:35.580 --> 01:25:40.340
we are still resolving our problems
by killing each other.

01:25:50.100 --> 01:25:52.220
We lost here...

01:25:53.740 --> 01:25:56.660
the best people of our nation.

01:26:08.540 --> 01:26:14.620
Forever in our hearts.

01:26:21.140 --> 01:26:23.700
We paid a huge price.

01:26:31.900 --> 01:26:33.580
I want to thank you...

01:26:33.660 --> 01:26:39.300
Convict out!
Convict out!

01:26:39.380 --> 01:26:45.540
We heard what our so-called leaders
agreed to with the government...

01:26:45.620 --> 01:26:51.060
What happened today at
the Parliament was important.

01:26:51.940 --> 01:26:56.300
...to have new elections in December.

01:27:02.620 --> 01:27:07.780
I remember my father told me,

01:27:07.860 --> 01:27:10.620
"This is our end...

01:27:10.700 --> 01:27:15.580
Who wasn't killed, will be killed.
Who wasn't in prison, will go to prison."

01:27:16.780 --> 01:27:20.260
Today was a small victory.

01:27:21.100 --> 01:27:25.100
A small victory because of you.

01:27:26.580 --> 01:27:29.460
I realized that
we couldn't leave it like that.

01:27:29.540 --> 01:27:31.820
Our friends that we've lost
would not forgive us

01:27:31.900 --> 01:27:35.300
if we accepted those terms
from the government.

01:27:35.380 --> 01:27:39.300
-Glory to Ukraine!
-Glory to the heroes!

01:27:39.380 --> 01:27:40.740
Here's what I want to say.

01:27:40.820 --> 01:27:46.820
We're ordinary people, talking
to these politicians standing behind me.

01:27:46.900 --> 01:27:51.180
Yanukovych will not be
the president for one more year!

01:27:51.260 --> 01:27:55.260
Tomorrow by 10:00 a.m.,
he must resign!

01:27:56.300 --> 01:27:59.020
Resign! Resign!

01:27:59.100 --> 01:28:01.940
My compatriot was shot down!

01:28:02.020 --> 01:28:06.540
He had a wife and a baby!

01:28:06.620 --> 01:28:10.700
And our "leaders"
shake hands with these murderers!

01:28:10.780 --> 01:28:12.340
Shame on them!

01:28:12.420 --> 01:28:14.780
Shame on them!
Shame on them!

01:28:14.860 --> 01:28:20.220
I speak to you on behalf of my entire
Defense Unit that my father joined too.

01:28:20.300 --> 01:28:23.020
If tomorrow by 10:00 a.m.

01:28:23.100 --> 01:28:26.860
you do not make a statement
about Yanukovych's resignation,

01:28:26.940 --> 01:28:30.460
I swear, we will go on
an armed offensive!

01:29:13.980 --> 01:29:17.900
I ask you, dear colleagues,
to vote.

01:29:17.980 --> 01:29:20.660
The Ukrainian parliament,

01:29:20.740 --> 01:29:25.940
expressing the will
of the Ukrainian nation, declares,

01:29:26.020 --> 01:29:31.660
first, the President of Ukraine,
Viktor Yanukovych,

01:29:31.740 --> 01:29:37.340
has resigned in an unconstitutional way,

01:29:37.420 --> 01:29:42.300
and will not be fulfilling
the duties of the president.

01:29:44.140 --> 01:29:49.940
Second, schedule early
presidential election

01:29:50.020 --> 01:29:53.500
for May 25, 2014.

01:29:54.380 --> 01:30:00.780
Third, this resolution comes into effect
from the moment of its adoption.

01:30:09.660 --> 01:30:14.620
328 lawmakers voted in favor.
The resolution is adopted!

01:30:32.260 --> 01:30:35.860
For 23 years, we only had
our independence on paper.

01:30:35.940 --> 01:30:41.140
But now, so many people sacrificed
their lives that it has become real.

01:30:49.060 --> 01:30:54.380
Maidan was a small territory
that held great bravery.

01:30:59.300 --> 01:31:05.820
For the future of our children,
people were prepared to die.

01:31:07.300 --> 01:31:10.660
Even those who had
no children of their own.

01:31:12.420 --> 01:31:16.060
The people came out
and showed that we have the power.

01:31:21.420 --> 01:31:25.780
Muslims. Jews, Christians
of different denominations, Buddhists,

01:31:25.860 --> 01:31:28.300
and people who don't
subscribe to a particular faith,

01:31:28.380 --> 01:31:31.340
treated each other with respect.

01:31:32.900 --> 01:31:36.380
And I can say that
a new society was born.

01:31:37.140 --> 01:31:40.820
-Glory to Ukraine!
-Glory to the heroes!

01:31:53.140 --> 01:31:55.220
We were born in the '90s,

01:31:55.300 --> 01:31:57.340
we were born in
an independent Ukraine,

01:31:57.420 --> 01:31:59.660
we know the borders of our country,

01:31:59.740 --> 01:32:02.220
we understand the meaning
of word "patriotism".

01:32:03.780 --> 01:32:05.460
Glory to the heroes!

01:32:08.740 --> 01:32:13.820
It's an amazing generation
that grew up during the independence.

01:32:13.900 --> 01:32:17.780
They grew up as free people.

01:32:19.980 --> 01:32:22.580
No one can make a free person kneel.

01:32:27.540 --> 01:32:30.980
Maidan was a singular experience,

01:32:32.420 --> 01:32:35.660
when everyone felt real unity,

01:32:35.740 --> 01:32:39.060
real patriotism,
and felt the presence of God.
