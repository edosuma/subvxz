00:08.796 --> 00:10.754
( theme music playing )

00:16.213 --> 00:18.713
Larry:
Salman Rushdie
told me to live my life.

00:18.713 --> 00:23.255
And, you know,
I'm not thinking about it
as much as I used to,

00:23.255 --> 00:25.005
and so far,
so good.

00:25.005 --> 00:26.422
That's great.

00:26.422 --> 00:28.046
Oh, I know what I wanted
to talk to you about.

00:28.046 --> 00:29.879
I'm having this dream.

00:29.879 --> 00:32.046
- Right.
- I've had it,
like, three times.

00:32.046 --> 00:35.713
I'm in this room
and there's all
these virgins--

00:35.713 --> 00:37.838
beautiful virgins,
my God--

00:37.838 --> 00:41.380
- and they all wanna
have sex with me.
- Wow.

00:41.380 --> 00:43.297
And I count-- I keep
counting them up,

00:43.297 --> 00:45.713
and I can only
count 71.

00:45.713 --> 00:48.297
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6--
I'm counting with my head--

00:48.297 --> 00:50.338
7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12...

00:50.338 --> 00:52.796
Sometimes I'll start over--
one, two, three, four...

00:52.796 --> 00:54.921
Right,
the head count.

00:54.921 --> 00:57.171
Are you expecting
more or less?

00:57.171 --> 00:58.671
I'm expecting 72.

00:58.671 --> 01:00.463
What if you
just miscounted?

01:00.463 --> 01:02.130
That's a possibility.

01:02.130 --> 01:04.046
So, were you tempted
to have sex with them?

01:04.046 --> 01:06.088
Well, I wanted to,
but I was too concerned

01:06.088 --> 01:07.629
with the missing 72nd.

01:07.629 --> 01:10.879
- That was the issue.
- What's interesting to me

01:10.879 --> 01:15.838
is that I find
you're focused on
the number of women

01:15.838 --> 01:20.088
who apparently are
very interested in you,
and yet--

01:20.088 --> 01:23.171
Larry, you seem
preoccupied.

01:23.171 --> 01:26.629
I'm just wondering...
( scoffs )

01:26.629 --> 01:30.297
have you ever
noticed the disparity
in these two chairs?

01:30.297 --> 01:34.963
Your chair
is so much better
than this one.

01:34.963 --> 01:36.963
This is not
a comfortable chair at all.

01:36.963 --> 01:38.879
Did-- did you buy
these chairs?

01:38.879 --> 01:41.463
Yes, I-- I bought
both of them.

01:41.463 --> 01:43.255
- You picked out both of them?
- I picked them out, yeah.

01:43.255 --> 01:45.380
What was going
through your head when
you picked out this chair?

01:45.380 --> 01:46.963
You picked out
a great chair
for yourself.

01:46.963 --> 01:48.088
That's a gorgeous chair.

01:48.088 --> 01:49.463
I would have that
in my house.

01:49.463 --> 01:51.088
But this one,
it's not comfortable.

01:51.088 --> 01:53.088
I'm constantly shifting
from side to side.

01:53.088 --> 01:55.088
You have
the comfortable chair.

01:55.088 --> 01:57.005
You have taken
the good chair.

01:57.005 --> 02:01.338
It's interesting--
you are the first
and only patient

02:01.338 --> 02:03.713
who has ever said
anything negative
about that chair.

02:03.713 --> 02:05.796
I don't find that
interesting at all.

02:05.796 --> 02:08.796
Well, I do,
and that's my job--
to find things interesting.

02:08.796 --> 02:11.297
- Well... ( scoffs )
- Interesting with the chair.

02:11.297 --> 02:14.213
- I don't know what
you're writing over there.
- Chair issues.

02:14.213 --> 02:15.671
I think there's
something deeper.

02:15.671 --> 02:16.879
I don't think
you're writing anything.

02:16.879 --> 02:18.505
- No, I could show you.
- Huh?

02:18.505 --> 02:20.629
- I could show you.
- I mean, you're a nice man,

02:20.629 --> 02:22.921
but, you know, do you--
do you do that much?

02:22.921 --> 02:25.921
- Between you and me?
- Don't you think that I do

02:25.921 --> 02:27.796
a significant amount
of help to you?

02:27.796 --> 02:30.463
- Eh, no.
- Really?

02:30.463 --> 02:31.713
May I be honest
with you?

02:31.713 --> 02:34.879
I hope that you can always
be honest with me.

02:34.879 --> 02:37.213
Well, I'm often
never honest with you,

02:37.213 --> 02:39.046
but here's what
I'm proposing.

02:39.046 --> 02:40.547
I think you should
go chair shopping.

02:40.547 --> 02:42.422
I think you need
another chair.

02:42.422 --> 02:44.921
And you know what else?
I'm willing to go chair
shopping with you.

02:44.921 --> 02:50.297
- Will you think about it?
- I don't know, but I do know
that the session is over,

02:50.297 --> 02:52.422
and so we'll have to
pick this up next time.

02:52.422 --> 02:54.921
It's tough for you
to have to look at
that watch, isn't it?

02:54.921 --> 02:57.422
It must be a little awkward.
You know I see it.

02:57.422 --> 02:59.505
I know you see it.
I'm not trying to sneak it.

02:59.505 --> 03:01.838
You can't--
you're trying to do
a little sneaky watch peek.

03:01.838 --> 03:03.255
I'm not trying to do
a sneaky watch peek,

03:03.255 --> 03:05.380
I'm trying to be
efficient with our time.

03:05.380 --> 03:07.796
Why don't you
put a clock behind me

03:07.796 --> 03:10.547
so you can have a clock,
you know, when the time's up?

03:10.547 --> 03:14.088
- But, okay.
- Nevertheless,
it is-- it is over,

03:14.088 --> 03:17.588
and I'm looking forward
to seeing you again
next week.

03:17.588 --> 03:20.005
So, uh, you got big plans
for the weekend?

03:20.005 --> 03:22.796
This weekend
and all through next week

03:22.796 --> 03:26.422
my wife and I go out
every single night to
a different restaurant

03:26.422 --> 03:28.297
because
it's truffle season.

03:28.297 --> 03:31.380
- It's wonderful.
Do you like truffles?
- No, I loathe them.

03:31.380 --> 03:34.463
They're disgusting.
Oh, to each his own.

03:34.463 --> 03:35.963
- To each his own.
- Yeah.

03:35.963 --> 03:37.713
Okay.
Thank you, Larry.

03:37.713 --> 03:40.588
Okay. And, by the way,
any time you wanna get
rid of me as a patient,

03:40.588 --> 03:42.338
just say,
"I've had enough."

03:42.338 --> 03:44.754
It'll be--
it'll be okay with me.

03:44.754 --> 03:47.213
- ( door closes )
- Oh, dear God.

03:52.130 --> 03:54.088
( chatter )

04:04.921 --> 04:06.921
Oh, dear.

04:06.921 --> 04:08.505
Oh, dear.

04:08.505 --> 04:11.505
Hey!
How about this?

04:11.505 --> 04:13.255
I don't even know
how to react.

04:13.255 --> 04:14.879
It's unbelievable.

04:14.879 --> 04:17.838
So, uh, over at
the table over there,

04:17.838 --> 04:20.088
the young lady
in the red dress?

04:20.088 --> 04:21.754
Yeah, yeah,
I saw her earlier.

04:21.754 --> 04:25.505
She is a big-time
real estate agent.

04:25.505 --> 04:26.713
- Larry: Yeah?
- Okay, yes.

04:26.713 --> 04:28.046
Larry:
You looking for a house?

04:28.046 --> 04:30.338
Well, I'm gonna go out
looking for houses,

04:30.338 --> 04:33.171
- but I'm not looking
for a house.
- ( chuckles )

04:33.171 --> 04:34.713
Wow.

04:34.713 --> 04:37.255
What a diabolical
plan this is.

04:37.255 --> 04:39.713
It's a date,
but they don't
know it's a date.

04:39.713 --> 04:41.463
- Yes!
- And if I want
another date,

04:41.463 --> 04:43.921
I just go, "You know what?
This house doesn't
appeal to me.

04:43.921 --> 04:45.879
Tomorrow, are you good
to see another house?"

04:45.879 --> 04:47.796
- Doesn't cost you a nickel.
- Nope. Nope.

04:47.796 --> 04:50.213
She's excited to be with me.
She wants to please me.

04:50.213 --> 04:51.671
- She wants to please you.
- Yeah.

04:51.671 --> 04:53.463
- Oh, hey. Look at this.
- Thank you. I appreciate it.

04:53.463 --> 04:54.963
- Thank you very much.
- Oh, ho, ho!

04:54.963 --> 04:56.754
They love me!
They're loving it!

04:56.754 --> 04:58.754
- Ah!
- Thank you very much.

04:58.754 --> 05:01.671
- Congratulations.
- You don't have to
buy any of them.

05:01.671 --> 05:03.338
- You know...
- Well, I wasn't
gonna buy any,

05:03.338 --> 05:05.255
but, still, I can
congratulate you.

05:05.255 --> 05:06.838
Are you vying
for the title

05:06.838 --> 05:08.671
of the most pretentious
man in the world?

05:08.671 --> 05:09.713
- What, this?
- Yes.

05:09.713 --> 05:11.088
I've had this
for decades.

05:11.088 --> 05:14.005
It looks like the Little
Drummer Boy's funeral.

05:14.005 --> 05:16.838
- This is what he's
wearing in the casket.
- Mm-hmm, that's very funny.

05:16.838 --> 05:18.671
I never showed you
my paintings at home

05:18.671 --> 05:22.046
because I knew you would,
you know, just mock me
and destroy me, so...

05:22.046 --> 05:23.505
- a big night for me.
- Anyway, congratulations.

05:23.505 --> 05:25.338
- Congratulations.
- This is quite a display here.

05:25.338 --> 05:27.338
- Do you understand
any of it?
- No.

05:27.338 --> 05:29.005
No, it's very confusing.

05:29.005 --> 05:30.505
- You don't under--
- I don't think you do either.

05:30.505 --> 05:32.879
Let me show you one,
a painting I just sold.

05:32.879 --> 05:35.963
- I'm very excited.
- Then maybe you could explain
the mystery of that one.

05:35.963 --> 05:37.629
Richard: I will.
This is one of my favorites.

05:37.629 --> 05:40.213
Yeah, so I sold this
to a restaurant,

05:40.213 --> 05:41.713
and I'm really
proud of it.

05:41.713 --> 05:44.921
- Who is that?
- It's a self-portrait.

05:44.921 --> 05:46.838
That's you?

05:46.838 --> 05:49.380
What do you think
a self-portrait means?
Yeah, that's me.

05:49.380 --> 05:51.879
That's like you
from 50 years ago!

05:51.879 --> 05:54.088
- No, this is me now.
- Jeff: What?

05:54.088 --> 05:56.088
You honestly feel
you look like that?

05:56.088 --> 05:58.046
100%.

05:58.046 --> 05:59.463
You know what?

05:59.463 --> 06:02.046
I think I want a portrait
by Richard Lewis.

06:02.046 --> 06:04.046
Yeah, well, look,
he's gonna make you
look great.

06:04.046 --> 06:05.588
Maybe you could
paint me with hair.

06:05.588 --> 06:07.005
( guffaws )

06:08.629 --> 06:10.713
( chatter )

06:13.671 --> 06:15.213
- Hey.
- Hey!

06:15.213 --> 06:18.255
Did you hear about
Marty Funkhouser's
nephew, Kenny?

06:18.255 --> 06:19.380
- Yeah.
- He died.

06:19.380 --> 06:21.088
- Unbelievable.
- It's so sad.

06:21.088 --> 06:23.297
- I know.
- He was supposed to be
going to Stanford.

06:23.297 --> 06:25.338
- Larry: Yeah.
- You heard what
happened, right?

06:25.338 --> 06:27.422
- He got mixed up
with a prostitute.
- Prostitute, right.

06:27.422 --> 06:29.422
- Jeff: Mm-hmm.
- Ted: Followed her
to Europe.

06:29.422 --> 06:32.713
- Yeah.
- Ended up going to Pamplona
to run with the bulls.

06:32.713 --> 06:35.255
- And got trampled.
- I know.

06:35.255 --> 06:37.213
How does a young boy
get involved with
a prostitute?

06:37.213 --> 06:38.921
Well, I can
only surmise

06:38.921 --> 06:42.297
that he was
in need of a prostitute
for some reason,

06:42.297 --> 06:46.422
he met with the prostitute,
and he was in love with her
and followed her over there.

06:46.422 --> 06:49.629
- How do you know these details?
- I'm just putting two
and two together.

06:49.629 --> 06:53.255
- Where's the two and two?
- Well, two and two-- you got
a high school senior,

06:53.255 --> 06:55.671
he has an experience
with a prostitute,

06:55.671 --> 06:59.754
and then is so enamored,
that he-- he follows her
all the way to Spain.

06:59.754 --> 07:01.629
Again, very detailed.

07:01.629 --> 07:03.588
No, I'm just putting
two and two together,
that's all.

07:03.588 --> 07:04.963
Again, I don't see
the two and two.

07:04.963 --> 07:07.255
Oh, there's two
and there's another two.

07:07.255 --> 07:09.422
- Larry:
It's one and one together.
- It doesn't really add up.

07:09.422 --> 07:11.796
- Honestly.
It's too much.
- It's shocking.

07:11.796 --> 07:14.463
- It's shocking.
- Ted: He got trampled
to death.

07:14.463 --> 07:15.963
Well, that's not
so shocking.

07:15.963 --> 07:17.422
You're running
with the bulls.

07:17.422 --> 07:19.171
It'd be shocking
if he didn't die.

07:19.171 --> 07:21.463
- That's--
that's the shock.
- What?

07:21.463 --> 07:23.547
It's what men do.
They want to impress girls,

07:23.547 --> 07:25.297
so they do
crazy stuff like that.

07:25.297 --> 07:27.130
He wanted to impress
the prostitute?

07:27.130 --> 07:29.713
Yeah, usually,
you don't have to
impress a prostitute.

07:29.713 --> 07:32.213
Well, remember--
remember when we were dating

07:32.213 --> 07:34.213
and we went
horseback riding,

07:34.213 --> 07:35.963
and I galloped
and almost fell off?

07:35.963 --> 07:37.588
I was just trying
to impress you.

07:37.588 --> 07:39.629
Jeff:
Yeah, but she's
not a prostitute.

07:39.629 --> 07:41.671
- But I was having sex with her.
- But you weren't paying her
for it.

07:41.671 --> 07:44.046
- Cheryl: Okay.
- Right, right.

07:44.046 --> 07:47.754
- All: Oh.
- Marty, I am so sorry.

07:47.754 --> 07:50.338
- So sorry to hear about Kenny.
- Thank you, thank you.

07:50.338 --> 07:52.213
Really sorry.

07:52.213 --> 07:54.629
It's the worst thing
that's happened to me
in my life.

07:54.629 --> 07:58.046
- I mean, he's like
a son I never had.
- Ted: Mm.

07:58.046 --> 08:00.838
Although, my daughter
is transitioning.

08:00.838 --> 08:03.380
- Ah. How's that going?
- So far, so good.

08:03.380 --> 08:05.838
You know, I saw her
a couple of weeks ago.
She looked pretty good.

08:05.838 --> 08:08.297
- Yeah, well,
she's a he now, so.
- Yeah, he.

08:08.297 --> 08:09.921
When-- when does
she get the penis?

08:09.921 --> 08:12.671
He's talking about it.
It takes time to decide.

08:12.671 --> 08:15.380
Larry:
Well, if he gets the penis,
do they throw in the balls?

08:15.380 --> 08:18.588
Marty, I'm so sorry
about Kenny.

08:18.588 --> 08:20.547
Is there anything
we can do?

08:20.547 --> 08:22.422
I'd love you to come
to the memorial.

08:22.422 --> 08:24.588
- Oh, we wouldn't miss it.
- I appreciate it.

08:24.588 --> 08:27.547
Sorry, we have
an early dinner
to go to.

08:27.547 --> 08:29.796
Dinner?
It's 3:30.

08:29.796 --> 08:32.629
- Dinner?
- Hey, you better be
at the memorial.

08:32.629 --> 08:34.005
Oh, one sec.

08:36.380 --> 08:40.171
Hey, Cheryl, um,
let me ask you a question.

08:40.171 --> 08:42.380
When you're at
Dr. Templeton's office--

08:42.380 --> 08:44.213
we share
the same therapist--

08:44.213 --> 08:47.713
you ever notice how his chair
is so much better and bigger

08:47.713 --> 08:50.463
than that dinky chair
that he gives to us?

08:50.463 --> 08:53.088
I've never thought
about the chair when
I was in therapy.

08:53.088 --> 08:54.879
What-- what do you
think about that?

08:54.879 --> 08:57.338
I'm just so happy you're
seeing somebody, pal,
I really do.

08:57.338 --> 08:59.255
I think it's great.
Do you like him?

08:59.255 --> 09:01.505
I'm only seeing him
because of the whole
fatwa business, that's all.

09:01.505 --> 09:05.046
- Believe me.
- Well, don't make me sorry
that I recommended him to you.

09:05.046 --> 09:06.588
I'm not talking
about you.

09:06.588 --> 09:08.671
- Okay.
- Are you talking
about me?

09:08.671 --> 09:10.838
- We should go. Yeah.
- Ted: Yeah.

09:10.838 --> 09:12.921
All I'm saying is
next time you're there,

09:12.921 --> 09:15.213
just be kind of aware
of the chairs

09:15.213 --> 09:17.422
and the striking difference
between the two,

09:17.422 --> 09:19.422
and tell me
that I'm not crazy.

09:19.422 --> 09:21.879
Uh, we do have
reservations at Mélisse.

09:21.879 --> 09:23.422
- Do you know Mélisse? Ah!
- Mélisse?

09:23.422 --> 09:25.046
Good choice.
It's truffle season.

09:25.046 --> 09:26.547
( chuckles )
What?

09:26.547 --> 09:27.921
How do you know
it's truffle season?

09:27.921 --> 09:29.255
Dr. Templeton told me.

09:29.255 --> 09:31.422
What do you talk about
in your sessions?

09:31.422 --> 09:34.796
- That's okay.
That's okay. Okay.
- He loves truffles!

09:34.796 --> 09:36.754
( music playing )

09:50.130 --> 09:51.796
( grunting )

09:55.588 --> 09:57.588
Ay, dah!

09:59.963 --> 10:02.879
Larry: There's not enough room
to get my hand in there
to get the penis out.

10:02.879 --> 10:05.754
I've never really come
across this problem before.

10:05.754 --> 10:08.130
Can't get my penis
out of my pants?

10:08.130 --> 10:10.130
Have you ever heard
of a short fly?

10:10.130 --> 10:13.380
And I'm not gonna unbutton
and have them drop
on the floor.

10:13.380 --> 10:14.921
Look,
here's a solution--

10:14.921 --> 10:18.963
index finger,
you take it,
you go down,

10:18.963 --> 10:21.629
put it in your zipper,
press down on the shaft,

10:21.629 --> 10:23.255
allows your head
to pop up.

10:23.255 --> 10:24.796
- Pop up by itself.
- Huh.

10:24.796 --> 10:27.754
- Press, pop up.
- Like tiddlywinks.

10:27.754 --> 10:28.963
Yeah, like tiddlywinks.

10:28.963 --> 10:31.255
Those pants might've
been manufactured

10:31.255 --> 10:33.547
in a country that has
small penises.

10:33.547 --> 10:37.005
So these pants fit the penis
from whence they came.

10:37.005 --> 10:41.380
You're goddamn right.
Why would they make a little fly
in a country with big-ass dicks?

10:41.380 --> 10:42.713
See, I'ma tell you,
I don't have that problem

10:42.713 --> 10:44.171
'cause I buy my shit
from Jamaica.

10:44.171 --> 10:45.754
My pants are slacks.

10:45.754 --> 10:47.505
The manufacturer,
he makes jeans

10:47.505 --> 10:50.588
for people with big-ass
fucking johnsons, like me.

10:50.588 --> 10:52.629
- Wow.
- When I go
to the bathroom

10:52.629 --> 10:54.380
and I sit down
on the toilet,

10:54.380 --> 10:56.796
my johnson hangs
in the water.

10:56.796 --> 10:58.088
( scoffs, chuckles )

10:58.088 --> 11:01.171
That's just such nonsense.

11:01.171 --> 11:02.338
What are you
saying that for?

11:02.338 --> 11:03.505
I sit on
the fucking toilet,

11:03.505 --> 11:04.879
my shit goes
under the water

11:04.879 --> 11:06.171
like-- like this.

11:06.171 --> 11:07.671
It's almost like
it grabs its fucking head

11:07.671 --> 11:09.005
and just like--
and it goes in like this.

11:09.005 --> 11:10.505
- Bullshit.
- All the fucking time.

11:10.505 --> 11:12.297
- Penis touching the-- hey!
- When I sit down--

11:12.297 --> 11:13.838
Hey.

11:13.838 --> 11:15.838
Front door
was unlocked.

11:17.088 --> 11:18.380
- What?
- What?

11:18.380 --> 11:19.713
You left the door
unlocked again?

11:19.713 --> 11:21.046
We never had
that conversation, ever.

11:22.713 --> 11:24.130
I gotta
talk to you quickly.

11:24.130 --> 11:25.463
You're having lunch
with Lewis, right?

11:25.463 --> 11:27.046
- Yeah.
- Okay, get there early.

11:27.046 --> 11:29.255
Oh, yeah, 'cause he takes
the good seat, yeah.

11:29.255 --> 11:32.380
- What's wrong with him?
- I've never had lunch
with him in 20 years

11:32.380 --> 11:34.213
where I haven't been
looking at a wall.

11:34.213 --> 11:38.005
I say trick him the next time
in terms of what time lunch is.

11:38.005 --> 11:40.547
No, I'm just gonna show up
a half hour earlier.

11:43.380 --> 11:45.629
Uh, can we just have
a moment alone?

11:45.629 --> 11:48.088
Once I start laughing,
I'm a part of this shit.

11:48.088 --> 11:50.297
Get the fuck out.
You heard him.

11:50.297 --> 11:51.547
- Leon: It's all good.
- Yeah.

11:51.547 --> 11:53.588
Let you handle
your business.

11:53.588 --> 11:56.588
I'm trying
to be casual,

11:56.588 --> 11:58.130
but it's really
difficult.

11:58.130 --> 12:00.213
Remember the realtor
from the art gallery?

12:00.213 --> 12:03.796
- Yeah.
- Well, she had
an open house,

12:03.796 --> 12:07.380
and let's just say it stayed
open a little longer for me.

12:07.380 --> 12:09.338
Oh, yeah.
Oh, yeah.

12:09.338 --> 12:12.422
- You had sex with her
in an open house?
- In an open house.

12:12.422 --> 12:14.796
- That's unbelievable.
- Unbelievable.

12:14.796 --> 12:16.921
And you know
they have cookies
at the open houses.

12:16.921 --> 12:19.754
- Yeah.
- Brought the cookies up
with me, so we had sex...

12:19.754 --> 12:21.879
- Oh, my God.
- ...I had some cookies,
took a nap.

12:21.879 --> 12:25.838
- On what?
- Well, they have
the staging furniture.

12:25.838 --> 12:28.921
- Wow.
- Oh, wow, mm.

12:28.921 --> 12:30.422
- Why? What?
- What are you doing,

12:30.422 --> 12:31.463
listening in
to our conversation?

12:31.463 --> 12:32.754
Fuck, yeah, I was.

12:32.754 --> 12:33.921
He's listening
to the whole thing?

12:33.921 --> 12:35.588
Yes!

12:35.588 --> 12:38.463
You said leave,
you didn't say I
couldn't come back.

12:38.463 --> 12:40.588
Now tell me where
that fucking house is at.

12:42.629 --> 12:44.547
Larry:
So, now I'm having
this nightmare.

12:44.547 --> 12:47.796
I'm in this room,
maybe it's a hall
of some kind,

12:47.796 --> 12:50.505
I can't really tell,
and there's a lot of people,

12:50.505 --> 12:53.463
it's very crowded,
and I'm feeling a lot
of anxiety.

12:53.463 --> 12:55.838
And then all of a sudden,
I look up at this balcony

12:55.838 --> 12:57.963
and-- and I see
this guy,

12:57.963 --> 12:59.921
and he's wearing
a big coat,

12:59.921 --> 13:02.380
and I know this is it,
this is the fatwa!

13:02.380 --> 13:04.879
This is it
and I can't get out,
I'm trapped!

13:04.879 --> 13:07.338
Can I stop you right there
for a second?

13:07.338 --> 13:09.796
Can I tell you
what is really on my mind?

13:09.796 --> 13:11.754
I have a little bit
of an issue.

13:11.754 --> 13:15.963
- Please.
- Cheryl was in
just the other day...

13:15.963 --> 13:17.213
Mm-hmm.

13:17.213 --> 13:20.171
...and she
brought me a gift.

13:20.171 --> 13:24.338
You see this lovely
assortment of truffle oils?

13:24.338 --> 13:27.046
Huh, what do you know
about that?

13:27.046 --> 13:29.255
How did Cheryl know

13:29.255 --> 13:32.338
that my wife and I
love truffles?

13:32.338 --> 13:37.255
- You told Cheryl.
- Yeah, I told her you--
you love truffles, yeah.

13:37.255 --> 13:41.088
There's been a breach
of the patient-doctor
confidentiality.

13:41.088 --> 13:44.297
There's no such thing
as patient-doctor
confidentiality.

13:44.297 --> 13:46.005
I think what you're
referring to

13:46.005 --> 13:48.005
is doctor-patient
confidentiality,

13:48.005 --> 13:50.671
and that's a whole
different ball game.

13:50.671 --> 13:52.963
Larry, what I try
to create here

13:52.963 --> 13:55.005
is a circle of trust.

13:55.005 --> 13:57.671
And-- can I have
your arms for a second?

13:57.671 --> 14:00.380
- I'd rather not.
- All right. Well, then
I'll do it with my own arms.

14:00.380 --> 14:02.505
- Yeah, use your own arms.
- Here it is like this...

14:02.505 --> 14:03.879
- Yeah.
- ...and it creates
a circle.

14:03.879 --> 14:05.255
- Mm-hmm.
- And quite frankly,

14:05.255 --> 14:07.088
nothing should
leave this circle.

14:07.088 --> 14:08.879
It should be ironclad.

14:08.879 --> 14:11.171
All right,
I-- I apologize

14:11.171 --> 14:13.713
if I betrayed
your confidence in any way,

14:13.713 --> 14:16.713
and you have my word

14:16.713 --> 14:20.713
that it will never,
ever happen again.

14:20.713 --> 14:23.588
Larry, I think
this is a breakthrough.

14:23.588 --> 14:24.713
No, it's not
a breakthrough.

14:24.713 --> 14:25.963
I think
it's a breakthrough.

14:25.963 --> 14:27.297
It's not
a breakthrough.

14:27.297 --> 14:28.713
I'm pretty sure
it's a breakthrough.

14:28.713 --> 14:30.796
I'm gonna write down
"breakthrough."

14:30.796 --> 14:32.754
You writing down "breakthrough"
is just a waste of
everybody's time.

14:32.754 --> 14:34.505
That whole pad,
you might as well
throw it--

14:34.505 --> 14:36.505
- there's nothing in that pad.
- "Breakthrough."

14:36.505 --> 14:38.838
Anything else
on your mind?

14:38.838 --> 14:42.547
You know, I've got
these pants, okay,

14:42.547 --> 14:45.588
and they have
a short fly.

14:45.588 --> 14:49.171
Very hard to, uh,
extricate the penis.

14:49.171 --> 14:50.629
You ever had a pair
of pants like that

14:50.629 --> 14:52.130
where you can't get
your penis out?

14:52.130 --> 14:54.171
Once, I think,
a while ago,

14:54.171 --> 14:55.838
and someone told me
of a method--

14:55.838 --> 14:58.005
I think you unzip,

14:58.005 --> 15:02.547
you dive down
with your index finger,

15:02.547 --> 15:04.629
- and... pop up.
- Pops up.

15:04.629 --> 15:05.963
- The tiddlywink--
- Tiddlywink!

15:05.963 --> 15:07.505
- Yeah!
- Yeah. That might work.

15:07.505 --> 15:08.921
My friend told me
the same thing.

15:08.921 --> 15:11.921
Listen,
Barneys Warehouse
is having a sale...

15:11.921 --> 15:13.671
- Mm-hmm.
- ...and I'm sure they have

15:13.671 --> 15:17.255
a variety
of long-fly slacks.

15:17.255 --> 15:18.921
All right, maybe
I'll check it out.

15:18.921 --> 15:21.754
Well, I see that
it is time to go.

15:21.754 --> 15:23.255
Do you know
how I know that?

15:25.005 --> 15:27.505
- Wait a second!
- ( chuckles )

15:27.505 --> 15:29.297
Ho, ho!
Look at that!

15:29.297 --> 15:33.297
Ah! I cannot tell you
how happy I am about that.

15:33.297 --> 15:35.463
It has made
my life easier.

15:35.463 --> 15:37.130
You see?
Everything's working.

15:37.130 --> 15:38.796
All we gotta do
is fix these chairs.

15:38.796 --> 15:41.963
I will call you first
if I ever decide to
go chair shopping.

15:41.963 --> 15:43.505
- Excellent.
- Thank you.

15:43.505 --> 15:44.921
- All right.
- All right, Larry.

15:44.921 --> 15:46.796
( music playing )

15:49.130 --> 15:51.963
- Good afternoon.
- Good afternoon.
Welcome to Rustic Canyon.

15:51.963 --> 15:54.629
I have a reservation
for David.

15:54.629 --> 15:57.963
I'm about, uh,
20 minutes early.

15:57.963 --> 15:59.255
Fantastic.

15:59.255 --> 16:00.463
Ah, the rest
of your party has
already arrived.

16:05.505 --> 16:07.463
( scoffs )

16:07.463 --> 16:09.463
It's unbelievable.

16:09.463 --> 16:11.963
- How long's he been here?
- About 10 minutes.

16:11.963 --> 16:13.505
- Ah.
- Yeah.

16:13.505 --> 16:15.171
- Okay, thank you.
- Enjoy.

16:20.380 --> 16:23.171
- Did you get here early enough?
- I got here when I got here.

16:23.171 --> 16:25.005
I'm here
20 minutes early,

16:25.005 --> 16:27.338
and he said you were here
10 minutes before me.

16:27.338 --> 16:30.547
That puts you here
a half hour before
the reservation.

16:30.547 --> 16:32.255
Well, you got here
early, too.

16:32.255 --> 16:34.338
Yeah, because I wanted
to beat you to the good seat,

16:34.338 --> 16:35.754
'cause you always
have to get the good seat.

16:35.754 --> 16:37.838
- That's not true.
- It is true.

16:37.838 --> 16:40.088
Come on, I got this fatwa.
I can't sit here with
my back to the door.

16:40.088 --> 16:41.505
I already
ordered something

16:41.505 --> 16:43.297
and I've touched
all the-- all the--

16:43.297 --> 16:45.338
That doesn't mean anything.
We'll get new silverware.

16:45.338 --> 16:46.671
You'll get a disease
or something.

16:46.671 --> 16:47.838
So, you're not gonna
let me sit there?

16:47.838 --> 16:49.297
No fucking way.

16:49.297 --> 16:51.213
You know what?
The next time we have lunch,

16:51.213 --> 16:53.754
you better set your alarm
for 7:00 in the morning.

16:53.754 --> 16:56.505
I'm setting my alarm
for 6:30, you prick.

16:56.505 --> 16:58.838
Is that so?
I'll be staying up
all night

16:58.838 --> 17:01.671
waiting outside that door
for them to open it.

17:01.671 --> 17:03.046
I'll be here
before the owner.

17:03.046 --> 17:04.838
Yeah? Well,
I got news for you.
I got perks.

17:04.838 --> 17:08.213
They bought my picture,
so I'm gonna sleep
in the kitchen.

17:08.213 --> 17:10.213
You lost, pal.

17:10.213 --> 17:11.879
( scoffs )

17:13.713 --> 17:17.338
Woman:
Oh, yeah! Oh!
Close that deal!

17:17.338 --> 17:19.213
- Jeff: You close the deal!
- You close the deal!

17:19.213 --> 17:22.130
- Jeff: You close the deal!
- Make me an offer!

17:22.130 --> 17:23.213
( Jeff moaning )

17:23.213 --> 17:24.463
Ooh!

17:24.463 --> 17:26.754
( both screaming )

17:28.422 --> 17:31.671
I've seen every house
that's for sale in Brentwood,

17:31.671 --> 17:35.754
and I've had sex in every house
that's for sale in Brentwood.

17:35.754 --> 17:38.838
We even had sex in a house
that was in escrow.

17:38.838 --> 17:40.796
- Yes.
- You don't have to
worry about hotels,

17:40.796 --> 17:41.921
- anything like that.
- Nothing.

17:41.921 --> 17:43.671
You go to
these houses.

17:43.671 --> 17:45.505
And let's say
I'm driving around
a different neighborhood

17:45.505 --> 17:47.171
and I see a house
that's for sale,

17:47.171 --> 17:48.754
gets me
kind of horny.

17:48.754 --> 17:52.255
She is not only
a good-looking woman,

17:52.255 --> 17:54.671
- but she's so stylish.
- Very sharp.

17:54.671 --> 17:56.671
- Both: She's very sharp.
- I need to up my game.

17:56.671 --> 17:58.588
It's-- now,
don't get me wrong,
it's a nice suit,

17:58.588 --> 18:00.255
but it's
four years old.

18:00.255 --> 18:02.671
You know what?
Barneys is having
a warehouse sale.

18:02.671 --> 18:03.963
The fuck
do you know from

18:03.963 --> 18:05.671
Barneys having
a warehouse sale?

18:05.671 --> 18:07.422
Never thought
I'd hear those words
coming out of your mouth.

18:07.422 --> 18:09.130
( exhales )
I-- I heard.

18:09.130 --> 18:10.505
What do you mean,
you heard?

18:10.505 --> 18:11.588
Who would've
told you that?

18:11.588 --> 18:12.879
( stutters )
I don't know.

18:12.879 --> 18:14.796
- I just heard somewhere.
- You heard?

18:14.796 --> 18:16.505
You wanna
explain yourself?

18:16.505 --> 18:19.463
Would you like to tell me
what I need to explain?

18:19.463 --> 18:21.713
Well, I just
got off the phone
with Jane Kleinberg

18:21.713 --> 18:25.754
and she told me
she saw you in a car
with another woman.

18:25.754 --> 18:27.671
Well, do you know
who that woman is?

18:27.671 --> 18:31.046
- No, I do not.
- She is a realtor.

18:31.046 --> 18:34.130
- Yeah.
- And I am looking
for houses.

18:34.130 --> 18:37.380
I was surprising you
by buying a house.

18:37.380 --> 18:38.671
- Really?
- Yeah.

18:38.671 --> 18:40.130
He was just telling me
all about it,

18:40.130 --> 18:41.963
and now you ruined
the surprise.

18:41.963 --> 18:43.505
Well, that's
very sweet of you.

18:43.505 --> 18:45.130
It is very sweet of me.

18:45.130 --> 18:47.963
How about this guy, huh?
You're a lucky woman.

18:47.963 --> 18:51.171
Thank you
for the surprise
and I'm sorry to ruin,

18:51.171 --> 18:54.338
but... you know,
I never know with you two.

18:54.338 --> 18:57.879
He's a beautiful man.
A beautiful man.

18:57.879 --> 18:59.213
That's right.

19:01.088 --> 19:03.380
- ( music playing )
- ( chatter )

19:10.463 --> 19:12.171
- You working here?
- Yes.

19:12.171 --> 19:14.796
Hey, could you
do me a favor?

19:14.796 --> 19:16.713
I want to sit
in the last row,

19:16.713 --> 19:18.588
in the seat
that's closest
to the door.

19:18.588 --> 19:20.671
Can you
reserve that for me?
Could you do that?

19:20.671 --> 19:23.171
I'm sorry.
We don't save seats.

19:23.171 --> 19:24.463
You don't save seats?

19:24.463 --> 19:26.088
What is that?
That's a policy?

19:26.088 --> 19:29.671
It's a memorial
and that's not part of it.

19:29.671 --> 19:33.130
What about
we make a little--

19:33.130 --> 19:34.547
we make a little deal?

19:34.547 --> 19:38.547
You get a little paid
for your trouble, huh?

19:38.547 --> 19:41.005
It's five bucks.

19:41.005 --> 19:42.963
Okay.

19:42.963 --> 19:45.171
- Is that better? Huh?
- Which seat was it again?

19:45.171 --> 19:47.879
- It was the last row?
- The last row,
closest to the door.

19:47.879 --> 19:50.005
- Uh-huh. Yeah.
- Yeah.

19:50.005 --> 19:51.671
- You got it.
- Thank you.

19:51.671 --> 19:52.963
You're welcome.

19:52.963 --> 19:55.754
...a very troubled family.

19:55.754 --> 19:56.671
Hey.

20:00.505 --> 20:02.671
Hmm.

20:02.671 --> 20:05.422
- Okay.
- Okay.

20:05.422 --> 20:06.838
- Cheryl.
- Hey.

20:06.838 --> 20:08.505
Hey.

20:08.505 --> 20:10.505
What's Dr. Templeton
doing here?

20:10.505 --> 20:13.547
Oh, you know,
Marty is having
such a hard time

20:13.547 --> 20:15.171
- with this whole thing.
- Is he?

20:15.171 --> 20:17.422
So I suggested
that he talk to Lionel.

20:17.422 --> 20:20.255
- Lionel?
- Dr. Templeton.

20:20.255 --> 20:22.713
You know,
this is odd, though,
because when he passed me,

20:22.713 --> 20:25.338
I gave him
a very friendly hello.

20:25.338 --> 20:26.754
I went, "Hey!"

20:26.754 --> 20:29.796
And I get back...

20:29.796 --> 20:33.422
And I couldn't tell
if it was a typical
funeral nod

20:33.422 --> 20:35.879
or if he's angry with me

20:35.879 --> 20:38.754
because I want to change
the chair in the office.

20:38.754 --> 20:40.255
Well, it seems like
it would be odd

20:40.255 --> 20:42.754
for him to give you
a big hello at a funeral.

20:42.754 --> 20:45.629
- I'm not asking
for a big hello, Cheryl.
- A young man died

20:45.629 --> 20:47.838
and needs all of his
friends and family.

20:47.838 --> 20:50.213
I'm asking for, you know,
a friendly hello.

20:50.213 --> 20:51.838
"Ah."
That's not big.

20:51.838 --> 20:54.754
You know,
maybe you should make it
less about you.

20:54.754 --> 20:57.088
And by the way,
you really got me
in a lot of trouble...

20:57.088 --> 20:58.463
- Why?
- ...with Dr. Templeton.

20:58.463 --> 21:00.213
Because you told him
that I said

21:00.213 --> 21:01.297
that he likes truffles.

21:01.297 --> 21:03.213
I got him truffle oil
as a gift.

21:03.213 --> 21:04.963
I didn't-- wasn't
even talking about you.

21:04.963 --> 21:06.380
- How...?
- Well, he said
it was a breach

21:06.380 --> 21:08.297
of patient-doctor
confidentiality,

21:08.297 --> 21:09.838
which there's
really no such thing.

21:09.838 --> 21:11.463
Okay, well, then,
you know what?

21:11.463 --> 21:14.213
We should respect Lionel
and his process and--

21:14.213 --> 21:16.130
You don't have to keep
calling him Lionel.

21:16.130 --> 21:18.671
Maybe it's getting
too complicated

21:18.671 --> 21:20.671
having the same therapist.

21:20.671 --> 21:22.879
Gotta say,
you're looking sharp,
sweetheart.

21:22.879 --> 21:25.255
I like this three-piece.
I like the whole look.

21:25.255 --> 21:26.463
- Yeah?
- This slims you.

21:26.463 --> 21:28.213
It holds you in,
it's great.

21:28.213 --> 21:29.963
- I--
- Where'd you get that?
Barneys, you said?

21:29.963 --> 21:33.213
- Barneys Warehouse sale.
- Barneys Warehouse sale?

21:33.213 --> 21:35.463
How the fuck did you know
about Barneys Warehouse sale?

21:35.463 --> 21:37.171
Uh, Larry told me.

21:37.171 --> 21:40.130
- Larry  told you about
Barneys Warehouse sale?
- Yeah.

21:40.130 --> 21:42.005
I find that
very difficult to believe.

21:42.005 --> 21:44.671
- Why do you even give a shit?
- Larry! Lar!

21:44.671 --> 21:46.005
Come over here.

21:46.005 --> 21:47.505
There's always
something up with you two

21:47.505 --> 21:48.838
that I can't trust,
you know that?

21:48.838 --> 21:51.838
Did you tell Jeff about
Barneys Warehouse sale?

21:51.838 --> 21:53.879
- Yeah.
- Where'd you hear
about that from?

21:53.879 --> 21:56.297
That's so not you.

21:56.297 --> 21:58.713
Uh, I can't say.

21:58.713 --> 22:00.713
What do you mean
you can't say?

22:00.713 --> 22:04.754
( loudly )
I can't say who told me
about Barneys Warehouse sale.

22:04.754 --> 22:06.588
I'm not at liberty to say.

22:06.588 --> 22:08.505
It's a fucking sale,
Larry.

22:08.505 --> 22:10.547
Who gives a shit?
Just tell me who told you.

22:10.547 --> 22:14.713
( loudly )
No, I will not
and cannot tell you

22:14.713 --> 22:17.921
who told me about
Barneys Warehouse sale.

22:17.921 --> 22:19.671
All right,
this is sounding
like bullshit now.

22:19.671 --> 22:22.088
This sounds like another
one of your mishegoss
bullshit thing.

22:22.088 --> 22:25.754
- It's not. Just tell her.
- That is confidential
information,

22:25.754 --> 22:29.338
which I will never reveal
under any circumstances.

22:29.338 --> 22:30.879
Larry didn't tell you
about Barneys Warehouse.

22:30.879 --> 22:32.588
- He told me about Barneys.
- No, he did not.

22:32.588 --> 22:34.380
( all shouting )

22:34.380 --> 22:35.547
That I cannot say!

22:35.547 --> 22:39.088
Not today,
not tomorrow, not ever!

22:39.088 --> 22:41.422
- That's it!
- Susie: All right,
you're a fucking liar, Jeff.

22:41.422 --> 22:44.005
- Jeff: I'm not a liar!
- There's something
you're not telling me.

22:44.005 --> 22:46.046
Larry:
Dr. Templeton!

22:46.046 --> 22:49.046
- Hey!
- Honey, I'll be right in.

22:49.046 --> 22:53.255
Hey. Listen,
I-- I happened to overhear
that conversation,

22:53.255 --> 22:56.213
and I'm very appreciative
that you respected

22:56.213 --> 22:57.796
the patient-doctor
confidentiality.

22:57.796 --> 22:59.046
Hey, you're welcome.

22:59.046 --> 23:00.505
You know, when somebody
tells me something,

23:00.505 --> 23:01.505
I take it to heart.

23:01.505 --> 23:02.671
Glad to hear that.

23:02.671 --> 23:04.171
You know, I noticed

23:04.171 --> 23:06.380
when I said hello
to you earlier,

23:06.380 --> 23:08.297
I gave you
a very hearty hello

23:08.297 --> 23:11.754
and your response
was kind of grim.

23:11.754 --> 23:14.588
- Was that a funeral hello?
- Well, very observant.

23:14.588 --> 23:18.380
It was a downward nod
indicating a solemn hello

23:18.380 --> 23:20.921
as opposed
to an upward nod

23:20.921 --> 23:23.422
where it would be
a more joyous occasion.

23:23.422 --> 23:25.088
Gotcha.
So, you're not
mad at me?

23:25.088 --> 23:28.213
Oh, no, no, no, I'm not--
I'm not mad at you at all.

23:28.213 --> 23:30.588
Have you considered
my generous offer

23:30.588 --> 23:32.005
to go chair shopping
with you?

23:32.005 --> 23:36.088
I have considered it, yes,
and I am declining it.

23:36.088 --> 23:38.255
- Huh.
- I think if I go
chair shopping,

23:38.255 --> 23:40.422
I'll-- I'll do it
by myself.

23:40.422 --> 23:42.796
- Thank you.
- Well, you'll be making the
same mistake all over again.

23:42.796 --> 23:44.463
You'll have
a substandard chair

23:44.463 --> 23:45.796
and a lot
of unhappy clients.

23:45.796 --> 23:48.754
That presumes
a mistake was made
initially.

23:48.754 --> 23:50.796
- Hmm.
- Now, if you'll excuse me,

23:50.796 --> 23:52.338
Mrs. Templeton
is waiting for me.

23:52.338 --> 23:54.629
- How is Mrs. Templeton?
- She's quite well.

23:54.629 --> 23:57.297
I'd like to--
I'd like to meet her.

23:57.297 --> 24:01.380
I don't think
that is necessary,
really, Larry.

24:01.380 --> 24:03.796
- Do you?
- Cheryl tells me
that she met her.

24:03.796 --> 24:07.422
Oh, yes.
Cheryl and Mrs. Templeton
are quite friendly.

24:07.422 --> 24:10.629
So, why can
Cheryl meet her
and not me?

24:10.629 --> 24:13.838
- I don't get that.
- Well, Mrs. Templeton
has already indicated

24:13.838 --> 24:15.463
that she would rather
not meet you.

24:15.463 --> 24:16.838
Hmm.
Well, in any event,

24:16.838 --> 24:18.754
please give my regards
to Mrs. Templeton.

24:18.754 --> 24:20.338
I probably won't.

24:20.338 --> 24:23.629
Well, if you change
your mind, Lionel,
you'll let me know.

24:23.629 --> 24:25.547
Oh, Larry.

24:25.547 --> 24:27.088
Would it be all right
if you continued

24:27.088 --> 24:29.629
to refer to me
as Dr. Templeton?

24:29.629 --> 24:31.963
( music playing )

24:36.921 --> 24:40.088
Shalom and welcome
to the celebration of life

24:40.088 --> 24:42.338
of Kenny Funkhouser.

24:42.338 --> 24:46.005
We begin today
with the traditional
memorial prayer,

24:46.005 --> 24:48.963
Kel Maleh Rachamim.

24:48.963 --> 24:53.505
♪ Kel maleh rachamim... ♪

24:55.380 --> 24:58.255
- Hey, that's my seat.
- What are you talking about?

24:58.255 --> 25:00.005
I reserved--
I reserved that seat.

25:00.005 --> 25:02.255
I gave the guy
20 bucks to reserve--
look, here's the sign.

25:02.255 --> 25:04.130
- You threw it on the floor?
- Fuck the reserved sign.

25:04.130 --> 25:06.338
This is a memorial service,
not a Knick game.

25:06.338 --> 25:08.505
- Respect the reserved sign.
- This is the worst seat
in the whole house.

25:08.505 --> 25:11.005
- I did it because
the bathroom's 10 feet away--
- Look. See?

25:11.005 --> 25:12.838
It's a reserved sign.
You can't just throw it
on the floor.

25:12.838 --> 25:14.380
It should say "asshole,"
not "reserved."

25:14.380 --> 25:16.171
Do me a favor
and beat it, will ya?

25:16.171 --> 25:18.380
- Just get outta here.
- I got a fatwa I gotta
deal with, here.

25:18.380 --> 25:20.671
- I need that seat.
- I'm sorry about
your fatwa,

25:20.671 --> 25:22.879
but I got a problem
with my urinary tract.

25:22.879 --> 25:24.547
You always have to have
the good seat, don't you?

25:24.547 --> 25:26.505
Always.
That was my seat!
You took it again!

25:26.505 --> 25:27.879
- It wasn't your seat.
- You took it again!

25:27.879 --> 25:29.255
You took it again!
You took it again!

25:29.255 --> 25:30.380
- Man: Shh!
- I didn't.

25:30.380 --> 25:31.713
The Lord is his portion.

25:31.713 --> 25:33.171
Larry:
What happened
to the seat?

25:33.171 --> 25:34.838
- I gave you $20.
- May he rest in peace.

25:34.838 --> 25:36.921
I know, I reserved it,
but he just ignored it.

25:36.921 --> 25:38.422
- Rabbi: Amen.
- All: Amen.

25:38.422 --> 25:39.796
Get him outta there!

25:39.796 --> 25:41.838
- He's a mourner.
- He's not mourning!

25:41.838 --> 25:44.380
If he's mourning,
it's 'cause he's losing
his hair on the top.

25:44.380 --> 25:46.838
- That's what he's mourning.
- I'm an usher,
I'm not a bouncer.

25:46.838 --> 25:48.463
Okay, you know what?
Forget it.

25:48.463 --> 25:50.213
You're the last usher
I ever bribe.

25:50.213 --> 25:53.338
Fear not death.
We are all destined to die.

25:53.338 --> 25:55.338
- We share it with
all who ever lived.
- Is this taken?

25:55.338 --> 25:57.629
- It's reserved.
- Oh, okay, great.

25:57.629 --> 26:00.171
Rabbi:
Death is better
than a life of pain,

26:00.171 --> 26:02.380
- and eternal rest
than constant sickness.
- Oh, hello, Mrs. Templeton.

26:02.380 --> 26:05.338
Larry, do not address
Mrs. Templeton.

26:05.338 --> 26:07.213
I hope you're enjoying
truffle season.

26:07.213 --> 26:09.213
- Larry, find a seat.
- Okay.

26:09.213 --> 26:11.380
- Rabbi: ...as a grain
of sand...
- Sorry.

26:11.380 --> 26:13.838
- ...the good things
in life...
- Who's she?

26:13.838 --> 26:16.588
- I'm Kenny's cousin.
- It's none of your business,
anyway.

26:16.588 --> 26:18.338
- Go find a seat.
- Why didn't you save me a seat?

26:18.338 --> 26:20.130
You didn't ask me
to save you a seat.

26:20.130 --> 26:23.629
- Marty: Hey.
- Sorry, sorry, sorry.

26:23.629 --> 26:25.671
I'd like to bring forward
Kenny's uncle,

26:25.671 --> 26:28.754
Martin Funkhouser,
who would like to say
a few words.

26:28.754 --> 26:31.088
- Great. ( scoffs )
- Martin, please?

26:31.088 --> 26:33.171
- Marty: Thank you,
Rabbi Dorfman.
- Oh, sorry.

26:33.171 --> 26:36.088
I would like
to take a moment
to acknowledge

26:36.088 --> 26:38.380
my former beautiful
daughter Jodi,

26:38.380 --> 26:40.130
who's now
my handsome son Joey.

26:40.130 --> 26:41.629
- I love you, Joey.
- Thank you. I love you.

26:41.629 --> 26:43.629
- Keep up the good work.
- Thank you.

26:43.629 --> 26:46.463
Kenny Funkhouser
was my nephew.

26:46.463 --> 26:48.130
He was a golden child.

26:48.130 --> 26:50.171
- He was a straight-A student.
- ( sobbing )

26:50.171 --> 26:53.213
A great athlete
who was going to Stanford.

26:53.213 --> 26:55.088
All-American
baseball player.

26:55.088 --> 26:57.422
- ( sobbing loudly )
- Hey, hey, hey, come on,
come on.

26:57.422 --> 27:00.588
- That's way too loud.
- Okay, okay, okay.

27:00.588 --> 27:02.796
Just whimper.
Can you whimper?

27:02.796 --> 27:06.547
This is a day
of celebrating
Kenny's life.

27:06.547 --> 27:07.921
- ( sobbing continues )
- What are you doing?

27:07.921 --> 27:09.796
Go cry outside,
for God's sake.

27:09.796 --> 27:12.796
- He's so young.
- Ah, come on,
it's enough already.

27:12.796 --> 27:14.838
I can't hear a thing.

27:14.838 --> 27:16.505
- Shut up.
- Okay, okay.

27:16.505 --> 27:19.338
Let me say some things
about Kenny Funkhouser.

27:19.338 --> 27:21.588
- Kenny is with us.
- ( sniffling )

27:21.588 --> 27:23.713
He will always be with us.

27:23.713 --> 27:26.005
And someday,
we'll see him again.

27:26.005 --> 27:28.713
Maybe play catch
with him, even.

27:28.713 --> 27:32.213
When we leave
this service today,
let's not feel sad.

27:32.213 --> 27:36.338
Let's be upbeat,
because that's what
Kenny would've wanted.

27:36.338 --> 27:39.297
He was a very happy
young man.

27:39.297 --> 27:41.088
Fatwa!
He's got a gun!

27:41.088 --> 27:44.671
( all screaming )

27:46.754 --> 27:48.505
Ah! Oh, oh!

27:49.796 --> 27:52.171
- Oh, my God!
- ( people screaming )

27:52.171 --> 27:55.130
Go, sweetie, this way.
Go out this way.

27:55.130 --> 27:56.547
( Ted shouting )

27:56.547 --> 27:58.171
- No! Jesus!
- Wait, Ted!

27:58.171 --> 28:00.713
Go! Fatwa!

28:02.671 --> 28:04.380
- Man: Come on.
- Man #2: Hurry up!

28:04.380 --> 28:05.879
That's-- hey!

28:05.879 --> 28:08.547
That's my friend,
you idiot!

28:12.588 --> 28:15.505
Oh.

28:15.505 --> 28:18.046
Sorry.

28:18.046 --> 28:20.380
( receding footsteps )

28:22.005 --> 28:23.754
Sorry.

28:26.088 --> 28:28.130
Woman:
So, as you can see,
great flow.

28:28.130 --> 28:29.588
We're just gonna move
through here.

28:29.588 --> 28:32.130
Let me show you why
this is your house.

28:32.130 --> 28:34.629
Chef's kitchen,
you got silent dishwashers.

28:34.629 --> 28:36.213
It's an entertainer's dream,
really.

28:36.213 --> 28:37.921
You could entertain
for 100 people here

28:37.921 --> 28:40.588
or you could
entertain for two.

28:40.588 --> 28:42.588
- Wow.
- Floor-to-ceiling windows.

28:42.588 --> 28:46.130
- Pizza oven.
- Uh-huh. And where's
the master bedroom?

28:46.130 --> 28:49.505
- The master bedroom
is upstairs.
- Okay.

28:49.505 --> 28:52.422
And we could take
the grand staircase

28:52.422 --> 28:55.255
or we could take
the elevator.

28:55.255 --> 28:56.921
Elevator.

28:56.921 --> 29:00.422
( music playing )

29:07.171 --> 29:10.171
This is your own
little sanctuary.

29:10.171 --> 29:13.255
Beautiful, spacious room.
Lots of morning light.

29:13.255 --> 29:15.463
- Beautiful place
to wake up.
- Uh-huh.

29:15.463 --> 29:17.297
Just a great energy
in here overall.

29:17.297 --> 29:19.963
Mm-hmm. Furniture
come with the house?

29:19.963 --> 29:21.671
No, the furniture
is staged,

29:21.671 --> 29:24.588
but I could
talk to the designer
about throwing it in.

29:24.588 --> 29:27.754
- You like this bed, Jeff?
- ( mutters )

29:27.754 --> 29:31.297
- Negotiable
on the price or what?
- They're firm with the price.

29:31.297 --> 29:33.629
It's out
of our price range.

29:33.629 --> 29:35.463
- Come on.
- We'll take it.

29:35.463 --> 29:37.754
- Huh?
- We'll take it.

29:37.754 --> 29:40.255
Sold.
Congratulations.

29:40.255 --> 29:42.505
( music playing )

29:46.338 --> 29:47.921
I gotta tell you
something.

29:47.921 --> 29:50.713
I never thought
I was gonna get you
down here.

29:50.713 --> 29:52.422
- This is nice.
- Let's see.

29:52.422 --> 29:53.963
- Try that.
- ( sighs )

29:53.963 --> 29:55.754
What do you think?

29:55.754 --> 29:57.963
- No, I don't think so. No.
- I don't think so, either.

29:57.963 --> 29:59.046
- Not this one.
- No.

30:01.505 --> 30:04.629
This isn't bad.
It's got-- it's a bit
of a rocker, here.

30:04.629 --> 30:06.130
Let's move
to another chair.

30:07.838 --> 30:10.463
- All right.
- All right, I gotta say,

30:10.463 --> 30:14.629
this one, to me,
is a perfect chair.

30:14.629 --> 30:16.713
I think my clients
would like this.

30:16.713 --> 30:18.046
- Great.
- Why not?

30:18.046 --> 30:20.588
Well, let me...

30:20.588 --> 30:22.838
Ooh, it's kind of pricey.
( chuckles )

30:22.838 --> 30:24.671
Well, thank you.
Thank you very much.

30:24.671 --> 30:26.838
That's very generous
of you, Larry.

30:26.838 --> 30:29.671
Are you expecting me
to pay for this chair?

30:29.671 --> 30:31.671
That is all
the time we have.

30:31.671 --> 30:33.838
And, well,
I'll see you next week.

30:35.380 --> 30:38.297
Okay?
Thank you, Larry.

30:38.297 --> 30:41.213
( theme music playing )

31:52.505 --> 31:54.213
Small favor. Could you drop
a book off for me?

31:54.213 --> 31:55.380
I'm pretty sure
the U.S. government

31:55.380 --> 31:57.297
would consider that
free mail,

31:57.297 --> 31:58.713
which is kind of illegal.

31:58.713 --> 32:00.255
Do you think that's
a good quality, stickling?

32:00.255 --> 32:01.171
Don't stickle.

32:01.838 --> 32:04.005
I don't care what she does.
All men are like that.

32:04.005 --> 32:05.547
We don't care about
what they do.

32:05.547 --> 32:06.671
We care about what
they look like.

32:06.671 --> 32:07.671
Women are just the opposite.

32:07.671 --> 32:09.547
I would date a garbage woman.

32:09.547 --> 32:11.130
I've never seen
a garbage woman.

32:11.130 --> 32:12.588
Expect a letter soon.

32:12.588 --> 32:15.463
Soon? A day, two days,
four days?

32:15.463 --> 32:17.921
-Everybody know what soon is.
-I don't know what soon is.

32:17.921 --> 32:19.171
-Soon is soon.
-It's a very loose--

32:19.171 --> 32:20.463
-Soon is not soon!
-Soon is soon.

32:20.463 --> 32:21.671
Soon is not soon!
