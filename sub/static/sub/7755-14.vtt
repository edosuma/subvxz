Fie and fie again.
We've been chewing the wrong
books.

13:07.821 --> 13:12.257
Oh, we're gonna flunk the test.
We'll get caught in a downward
spiral of failure, we'll get

get away with this?
>> Gumball: To be honest, yeah,
i thought we could.

13:39.953 --> 13:44.556
I have no idea what went wrong.
>> Well, maybe you'll figure it
out during spring break, which

you're spending in detention!
I'm putting you in the
long-detention block.

you don't go to the bathroom,
you don't speak, you don't even

more sense.

>> Darwin: A kiss to make it
better?
>> Gumball: No.

14:52.826 --> 14:59.631
We need to look older if we want
them to respect us.
Let's get some tattoos, homeboy.

14:59.633 --> 15:02.967
What do you think?
>> Darwin: I don't know.
I think we look a bit too old

>> You owe me more than that if
you want my protection, "daby."

Not the correctional room!
>> Boys, i believe you keep
getting into trouble because

16:41.067 --> 16:45.169
you're not expressing yourselves
creatively.
To teach you how, I'm gonna read

freaked out so much.
