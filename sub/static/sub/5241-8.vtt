WEBVTT

00:10.851 --> 00:12.517
This is Clay Beckwith.

00:12.519 --> 00:13.685
He specializes in
defending rich athletes

00:13.687 --> 00:15.821
and their felonious relatives.

00:15.823 --> 00:18.690
I'd insist on therapy and
community service for Mary-Charles

00:18.692 --> 00:21.109
since she's ineligible
for a diversion program.

00:21.111 --> 00:22.327
I shouldn't have come.

00:22.329 --> 00:23.528
You came because you wanted to.

00:23.530 --> 00:25.414
We have ties that bind.

00:25.416 --> 00:27.449
What if it doesn't work out?

00:27.451 --> 00:30.202
I mean, could you imagine how much
trouble that'd cause for everybody?

00:30.204 --> 00:32.287
Imagine the best, not the worst, Cassie.

00:32.289 --> 00:33.589
Take a leap of faith.

00:33.591 --> 00:35.507
Just wink if I'm gonna be okay.

00:35.509 --> 00:39.378
Mr. Calloway.

00:39.380 --> 00:41.546
Why the hell did you tell
me I was gonna be okay?

00:41.548 --> 00:43.882
- Did she?
- You threw me under the bus.

00:43.884 --> 00:46.468
I'm a flawed person,
but I'm not irredeemable,

00:46.470 --> 00:48.220
and I really want to take you out.

00:48.222 --> 00:49.771
My shift ends at 2:00 AM.

00:49.773 --> 00:52.140
If you're here, maybe you get my number.

00:52.142 --> 00:53.725
Miss Pierce?

00:55.000 --> 01:01.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:02.736 --> 01:05.203
- You hacking into the Pentagon?
- Yep.

01:05.205 --> 01:06.872
Careful, they don't do WikiLeak
documentaries on brothers.

01:06.874 --> 01:08.907
Brothers go straight to Gitmo.

01:08.909 --> 01:10.659
I got a date with Allison. I'm
finding out what I can about her.

01:10.661 --> 01:12.794
That's the point of the date.

01:12.796 --> 01:14.663
- You been out of the game too long.
- Are you calling me old?

01:14.665 --> 01:16.415
I'm calling you married and old.

01:16.417 --> 01:19.167
Married or young, don't stalk
your way into this girl's heart.

01:19.169 --> 01:20.886
I'm scouting, not stalking.

01:20.888 --> 01:22.421
- I ain't diggin' up the girl's geotags.
- Oh, man, come on.

01:22.423 --> 01:24.423
Just browsing her social media.

01:24.425 --> 01:26.174
Picking up the breadcrumbs she
purposely left on her life's trail.

01:26.176 --> 01:28.393
I'm getting to know her
before I get to know her.

01:28.395 --> 01:30.178
Do that in person through conversing.

01:30.180 --> 01:31.596
It's all about discovery, baby.

01:31.598 --> 01:33.849
Discovery in person. That
shit fires the neurons.

01:33.851 --> 01:35.317
And there's probably shit on there

01:35.319 --> 01:36.935
she's outgrown and wants to forget.

01:36.937 --> 01:39.438
That's why I'm doing
this, to excavate her shit.

01:39.440 --> 01:41.356
Like Ronald Reagan
said, "Trust but verify."

01:41.358 --> 01:42.741
Did you just quote Ronald fucking Reagan?

01:42.743 --> 01:44.576
I got a new app about history, man.

01:44.578 --> 01:46.778
I'm trying to become more
educated during my longer shits.

01:46.780 --> 01:50.032
Just go, be you, be young,
black, famous, money out the anus.

01:50.034 --> 01:52.701
I'm telling you, this
girl is special, okay?

01:52.703 --> 01:55.620
- You don't know this girl.
- And neither do you.

01:55.622 --> 01:57.923
- Oh, my... damn.
- What? Let me see.

01:57.925 --> 02:00.542
- Reg, come on.
- Okay, yeah, yeah, yeah.

02:00.544 --> 02:02.427
I see it. I see it.
That is the kind of girl

02:02.429 --> 02:03.762
that you get pregnant on purpose, man.

02:03.764 --> 02:06.431
I see you.

02:06.433 --> 02:08.517
Man, I knew she had the
goods underneath them scrubs.

02:08.519 --> 02:10.801
Yeah, you got a real nobility of purpose.

02:10.804 --> 02:12.637
I meant that in the most
gentlemanly way possible.

02:12.639 --> 02:14.439
- Really?
- You know girls talk about dicks at brunch.

02:14.441 --> 02:16.358
Yeah, and thank God they do.

02:16.360 --> 02:17.976
If not, the world would be fuckin'
M-Chucks and M-Chucks alone.

02:17.978 --> 02:20.896
Hey, stop talking shit. Boys, Jules.

02:20.898 --> 02:22.114
- No way.
- Oh.

02:22.116 --> 02:23.482
- Way. 
- You two?

02:23.484 --> 02:24.816
Became one last night.

02:24.818 --> 02:27.569
Wow. Well, congratulations.

02:27.571 --> 02:29.154
Thank you.

02:29.156 --> 02:31.239
Um, y'all mind if I get you on the Snap?

02:31.241 --> 02:33.992
- Uh...
- Hey, what did I just say to you upstairs?

02:33.994 --> 02:35.994
That I was the best you ever had.

02:35.996 --> 02:39.164
Is that what she said?

02:39.166 --> 02:41.466
I told you that I would
bring you down to breakfast

02:41.468 --> 02:43.085
if you did not try to
Snapchat with my brother.

02:43.087 --> 02:45.387
He seemed friendly and open to it.

02:45.389 --> 02:46.805
- I am friendly.
- Not open to it.

02:46.807 --> 02:48.640
Jules, can I speak to you inside?

02:48.642 --> 02:50.509
- Are you asking me to leave?
- Politely.

02:50.511 --> 02:53.011
Okay.

02:53.013 --> 02:55.230
Uh, Cam, if things don't work
out between me and your sister,

02:55.232 --> 02:57.432
you and I can always give it a try.

02:57.434 --> 03:00.936
Thanks, but I'm currently in a
relationship that hasn't really started yet.

03:00.938 --> 03:03.522
Hey, my brother and I, we got a bro code.

03:03.524 --> 03:05.907
Oh, well, fine. We'll talk business, then.

03:05.909 --> 03:07.859
Cam, here's my business card.

03:07.861 --> 03:09.528
In case you ever wanna fucks with me.

03:09.530 --> 03:12.614
Jules, may I walk you to your car?

03:12.616 --> 03:13.915
I don't think this is gonna work.

03:13.917 --> 03:15.700
Why are you being such a drama king?

03:15.702 --> 03:17.953
- Just come on.
- So, when did that happen?

03:17.955 --> 03:19.588
Not sure.

03:19.590 --> 03:21.873
I ain't creeping on Chuck's geotags either.

03:21.875 --> 03:24.709
Look, now that you have downloaded
terabytes of Allison's data,

03:24.711 --> 03:26.178
what's the date plan?

03:26.180 --> 03:28.296
I seen a picture of steak
"tarter" on her Instagram,

03:28.298 --> 03:30.215
so I'm thinkin' I'm gonna
take her to Rathbun's.

03:30.217 --> 03:31.516
Steak tartare, it's not "tarter."

03:31.518 --> 03:32.884
What's steak "tarter," then?

03:32.886 --> 03:35.470
The shit left on your
teeth after you eat steak.

03:35.472 --> 03:37.389
Look, just ease up. Let it flow tonight.

03:37.391 --> 03:40.559
Be you. Okay, she gonna find out
who you are eventually anyway,

03:40.561 --> 03:42.394
and she'll either like it or she won't.

03:42.396 --> 03:44.279
That actually makes sense. Thanks, Reg.

03:44.281 --> 03:45.564
I still got it, baby.

03:45.566 --> 03:47.032
Yeah, but you still married as fuck.

03:47.034 --> 03:49.117
Hey, you find the right
woman, it ain't a bad thing.

03:49.119 --> 03:51.153
You can get on with the
living and the fucking

03:51.155 --> 03:53.121
instead of the Googlin' and the hopin'.

03:53.123 --> 03:54.406
- Ah.
- Ah.

03:54.408 --> 03:56.124
- All right, yeah.
- Okay, all right.

03:56.126 --> 03:57.626
- Let me see her picture again.
- Look.

03:57.628 --> 03:59.244
That's baby girl from the hospital?

03:59.246 --> 04:00.745
She's cute, right?

04:00.747 --> 04:03.582
Text me that photo immediately. Hi-res.

04:05.552 --> 04:08.587
Man, I'm gonna take me a bike ride.

04:08.589 --> 04:10.839
Yeah, get that body nice.

04:10.841 --> 04:13.175
Be a better me. And get some pussy, too.

04:13.177 --> 04:14.676
- Oh.
- Yeah, the same reason

04:14.678 --> 04:16.344
why M-Chuck goes to that head doctor.

04:16.346 --> 04:19.231
Mary-Charles is not seeing
a shrink for her health

04:19.233 --> 04:21.433
or for her pussy intake.

04:21.435 --> 04:24.269
She's court-ordered. She
don't go, she goes to jail.

04:24.271 --> 04:25.604
It's not so bad. I mean,
the breakthroughs hurt,

04:25.606 --> 04:27.572
but it's a good hurt.

04:27.574 --> 04:29.991
Breakthrough? Mary-Charles,
ain't nothing broken about you.

04:29.993 --> 04:32.110
That's what them headshrinkers
want you to think.

04:32.112 --> 04:33.945
That's the hustle. Only need therapy

04:33.947 --> 04:35.864
as long as you can afford to have it.

04:35.866 --> 04:37.282
Nobody's telling me what to think.

04:37.284 --> 04:39.501
Therapy's all about
listening to my thoughts.

04:39.503 --> 04:40.919
And your thoughts better not be about me

04:40.921 --> 04:42.120
'cause I raised the shit out of you.

04:42.122 --> 04:43.788
- Mm-hmm, she raised you.
- Hear that?

04:43.790 --> 04:45.957
All right, so don't let some voodoo doctor

04:45.959 --> 04:47.542
teach you how to hate
your family, you hear me?

04:47.544 --> 04:49.261
- I won't.
- All right.

04:49.263 --> 04:51.429
Hey, what'd you do with the
girl you brought home last night?

04:51.431 --> 04:54.266
- We finished fucking.
- Julius.

04:54.268 --> 04:56.434
- Hey, did she lick your belly button?
- No.

04:56.436 --> 04:58.637
- Julius.
- I mean from the inside.

04:58.639 --> 05:00.689
- I'm talking about the tongue going all the way...
- Hey, hey, hey, hey, enough.

05:00.691 --> 05:02.641
A little more respect here? Really.

05:02.643 --> 05:04.109
Hey.

05:04.111 --> 05:06.228
Hey. Oh, there's my number-one son.

05:06.230 --> 05:08.647
Look. Raised in the same household.

05:08.649 --> 05:10.899
He turned out fine. He
didn't need no shrink.

05:10.901 --> 05:12.868
Hey, not yet. Seize the day, y'all.

05:12.870 --> 05:14.986
- All right, baby.
- What's with the motivational phrase-ology?

05:14.988 --> 05:18.657
Some girl he hardly knows
got him thinking and thinking.

05:18.659 --> 05:19.991
Yeah. I gotta go. I'll see y'all.

05:19.993 --> 05:21.960
Wait a minute, Reggie.
I'm gonna ride with you.

05:21.962 --> 05:24.996
Missy's gonna school me on how
to make dumplings for my Chen.

05:24.998 --> 05:27.666
He's ten pounds away from
being the perfect man.

05:27.668 --> 05:29.251
I need something to grab.

05:29.253 --> 05:31.303
What does Missy know
about making dumplings?

05:31.305 --> 05:32.754
Hopefully more than me.

05:32.756 --> 05:35.340
Hey, when did you and
Mr. Miyagi get so serious?

05:35.342 --> 05:36.675
Stop calling him that.

05:36.677 --> 05:38.560
Okay. Well, wax on and wax off.

05:38.562 --> 05:40.061
Fuck you.

05:40.063 --> 05:41.479
- I gotta go, man.
- Oh, I do, too.

05:41.481 --> 05:42.847
Oh, what? Everybody's...

05:42.849 --> 05:45.850
What... what? Everybody's leaving?

05:45.852 --> 05:47.852
I got the place all to myself?

05:47.854 --> 05:49.738
You keep your clothes
on in the common areas

05:49.740 --> 05:51.690
and don't get any ideas.

05:51.692 --> 05:53.408
You know I ain't got no underwear on...

05:53.410 --> 05:55.026
Okay, you have made it this far.

05:55.028 --> 05:56.661
Don't be a creepy uncle now, please.

05:56.663 --> 05:58.163
All right.

06:37.537 --> 06:39.821
Mm.

06:43.543 --> 06:45.210
How's that?

06:53.837 --> 06:56.721
* Come on, baby *

06:56.723 --> 07:00.642
* Let's go, everybody,
like you got the right thing *

07:00.644 --> 07:02.093
* We need peace *

07:03.981 --> 07:07.932
* We've got to have
freedom all the same *

07:07.934 --> 07:09.651
* Come on *

07:09.653 --> 07:11.486
* Give me freedom *

07:11.488 --> 07:13.688
* Brother, brother *

07:13.690 --> 07:15.690
* Give me freedom *

07:15.692 --> 07:17.909
* Brother, brother *

07:17.911 --> 07:19.944
* Give me freedom *

07:19.946 --> 07:22.030
* Brother, brother *

07:22.032 --> 07:24.332
* Give me freedom *

07:24.334 --> 07:26.034
* Brother, brother *

07:26.036 --> 07:29.954
* Come on, brother,
give me freedom *

07:29.956 --> 07:31.956
* Show me how to do it *

07:31.958 --> 07:35.126
* Walk down the road
and say that you ain't... *

07:35.128 --> 07:37.962
Hey! Stop! I wanna talk!

07:37.964 --> 07:39.931
Then I'll kick your ass!

07:57.150 --> 07:58.450
Fuck.

07:59.736 --> 08:02.537
Ah.

08:12.165 --> 08:14.833
* Give me freedom,
brother, brother *

08:16.002 --> 08:17.669
* Give me freedom... *

08:17.671 --> 08:20.055
I know what it look like.

08:20.057 --> 08:21.556
A black man doing what
you heard black men do,

08:21.558 --> 08:23.141
but I live here.

08:23.143 --> 08:25.427
I'm Cam Calloway's uncle.
Professional baller.

08:25.429 --> 08:27.262
A thief stole my bike.

08:27.264 --> 08:30.815
I'm sorry to ramble, but
police make me nervous.

08:30.817 --> 08:32.317
It's genetic.

08:32.318 --> 08:33.434
You got ID?

08:33.437 --> 08:35.770
Oh, indeed. Can I... can I dig for it?

08:35.772 --> 08:38.405
Slow.

08:39.909 --> 08:42.025
You say someone stole your bike?

08:42.028 --> 08:43.778
Yeah, it's a 20-speed, man.

08:43.780 --> 08:46.498
I tried to catch him,
but he flew off like ET.

08:46.500 --> 08:47.749
His ID says he lives here.

08:47.751 --> 08:49.167
Yeah, Uncle Sam don't lie.

08:49.169 --> 08:51.202
- You get a good look at him?
- Yeah.

08:51.204 --> 08:52.954
- What'd he look like?
- White.

08:52.956 --> 08:54.756
Anything more specific?

08:54.758 --> 08:56.591
White. Like a privileged motherfucker.

08:56.593 --> 08:58.960
Like he had time to just sit around

08:58.962 --> 09:01.379
and do nothing but put
mousse and gels in his hair.

09:01.381 --> 09:02.680
Was he short? Tall?

09:02.682 --> 09:04.048
Average-size white guy.

09:04.050 --> 09:05.717
I can't tell these motherfuckers apart.

09:05.719 --> 09:07.218
No offense.

09:07.220 --> 09:09.137
You wanna roll with us?
See if we can find him?

09:09.139 --> 09:11.723
Yeah. Let's go find this Justin
Bieber lookin' motherfucker.

09:16.363 --> 09:17.729
Uh, hey, man.

09:17.731 --> 09:18.897
How can I help you?

09:18.899 --> 09:20.732
Uh, I'm here to see Allison?

09:20.734 --> 09:22.400
Who the fuck is Allison?

09:22.402 --> 09:24.702
- I don't know.
- Mm-hmm. Like shit you don't know.

09:24.704 --> 09:27.322
- Is Allison your girl?
- That's the hope,

09:27.324 --> 09:29.124
but unless you guys are her
roommates, I think I got the wrong...

09:29.126 --> 09:31.159
You lying ass home-wrecking ass.

09:31.161 --> 09:32.911
I'm done with you! You dirty bitch.

09:32.913 --> 09:34.496
- What you talking about?
- No!

09:34.498 --> 09:36.297
I promise you I'm not cheating
on you no more, Veronica.

09:36.299 --> 09:37.632
Damn.

09:37.634 --> 09:40.168
I'm so sorry, man. I think
I got the wrong apartment.

09:40.170 --> 09:42.086
It's all good, man. Look,
just get us to the playoffs

09:42.088 --> 09:44.055
- and we straight, baby.
- All right, then. Word.

09:47.394 --> 09:50.228
Cam.

09:50.230 --> 09:52.096
I think I just broke up a relationship.

09:52.098 --> 09:53.982
They fight all the time,

09:53.984 --> 09:55.984
and then they make up... loudly.

09:55.986 --> 09:58.236
So, uh, I got the apartment wrong.

09:58.238 --> 09:59.437
Did I get the night wrong, too?

09:59.439 --> 10:00.939
No.

10:00.941 --> 10:02.357
I mean, it's just 'cause you're in scrubs.

10:02.359 --> 10:05.109
Which is cool. I think
you look great in scrubs.

10:05.111 --> 10:06.778
You wanna come in for a minute?

10:06.780 --> 10:08.613
Yeah, sure.

10:12.619 --> 10:13.952
It's very spartan in here.

10:13.954 --> 10:15.587
I'm sorry?

10:15.589 --> 10:19.091
Uh, Spartan. I've been reading
history in my free time.

10:20.293 --> 10:22.293
Spartans weren't big on decorations.

10:22.295 --> 10:25.096
Maybe they worked 18-hour shifts like I do.

10:25.098 --> 10:26.514
I'm still pretty new to Atlanta.

10:26.516 --> 10:28.266
I was living in Athens till a while ago.

10:28.268 --> 10:30.134
People from Athens hated the Spartans.

10:30.136 --> 10:31.803
I was living in Athens, Georgia.

10:31.805 --> 10:34.272
Right. Just making a Greek joke.

10:34.274 --> 10:35.857
So, uh, what's in Athens, Georgia?

10:35.859 --> 10:37.942
- My boyfriend.
- Oh.

10:37.944 --> 10:39.143
He's my ex-boyfriend now.

10:39.145 --> 10:41.312
Right. Cool, cool, cool.

10:41.314 --> 10:43.031
I know this neighborhood isn't very nice.

10:43.033 --> 10:44.315
You must feel like
you're back in Dorchester.

10:44.317 --> 10:45.817
How you know I was from Dorchester?

10:45.819 --> 10:47.035
I Googled you.

10:47.037 --> 10:48.953
- You Googled me?
- I did.

10:48.955 --> 10:50.455
Oh, what came up?

10:50.457 --> 10:52.040
- You never Googled yourself?
- It's been a while.

10:52.042 --> 10:53.458
My cousin does it just to keep tabs.

10:53.460 --> 10:55.410
You got a guy who Googles you for you?

10:55.412 --> 10:58.379
Only very recently. So what came up?

10:58.381 --> 11:02.500
A lot. Your contract. Your
mother who whooped you.

11:02.502 --> 11:05.003
Your sister who almost punched your eye out

11:05.005 --> 11:06.638
and threw bibles in a church.

11:06.640 --> 11:07.972
That was page one.

11:07.974 --> 11:09.173
Everybody knows the
good stuff's on page two.

11:09.175 --> 11:12.010
Look, you seem like a good dude.

11:12.012 --> 11:15.179
Maybe even really good.
And you're handsome.

11:15.181 --> 11:17.098
Maybe even really handsome.

11:17.100 --> 11:19.234
So far I can't see why you
even let me in the house.

11:19.236 --> 11:21.402
But I read what I read,

11:21.404 --> 11:25.240
and I realized we're living
on two different Earths.

11:25.242 --> 11:27.859
So as flattered as I am that
you asked me out on the date

11:27.861 --> 11:30.862
and actually spent the last few
weeks trying to make this happen,

11:30.864 --> 11:32.997
I think we just should spare ourselves

11:32.999 --> 11:34.782
the trouble and time and not pursue this.

11:34.784 --> 11:38.002
Hold up. You're bouncing me
pre-date based on internet research?

11:38.004 --> 11:39.704
Based on reality.

11:39.706 --> 11:42.173
And I should have called you
before you made the trip over,

11:42.175 --> 11:44.709
and I'm sorry, but I wanted
to say this in person.

11:44.711 --> 11:46.678
You know, I Googled you, and I
didn't have a problem with it.

11:46.680 --> 11:50.048
You Googled me? When were
you gonna tell me that?

11:50.050 --> 11:51.382
I just did.

11:51.384 --> 11:53.518
And, you know, from what I saw,

11:53.520 --> 11:55.019
we ain't on two different Earths at all.

11:55.021 --> 11:56.304
I mean, why do you think we are?

11:56.306 --> 11:57.855
Because I got a little money

11:57.857 --> 11:59.023
and there's crazy women all over my house?

11:59.025 --> 12:00.525
That's every successful black man.

12:00.527 --> 12:01.893
You're exactly the kind
of person I should date.

12:01.895 --> 12:03.111
You know how I know?

12:03.113 --> 12:04.362
Because I would try to date you

12:04.364 --> 12:05.897
even if I was still in Dorchester

12:05.899 --> 12:08.232
with nothing to my name except my name.

12:08.234 --> 12:10.201
Even if nothing good
had ever happened to me,

12:10.203 --> 12:12.036
I'd still be interested in getting to know

12:12.038 --> 12:13.621
what appears to be a quality individual,

12:13.623 --> 12:15.573
and I would step up to
you and I'd say my piece.

12:15.575 --> 12:17.959
You can say that, but you can't know that.

12:17.961 --> 12:19.460
I can. There's things I know.

12:19.462 --> 12:21.996
Oh. Did you go to page two on my Google?

12:21.998 --> 12:23.581
I went to page five,

12:23.583 --> 12:25.049
which by then, I think, was
a different Allison Pierce.

12:25.051 --> 12:26.384
She's a mortician.

12:26.386 --> 12:28.553
So did you see my bathing-suit photo?

12:28.555 --> 12:30.838
See it every time I close my eyes.

12:30.840 --> 12:32.090
What is your point?

12:32.092 --> 12:33.341
I just hate that it's on there.

12:33.343 --> 12:35.259
I'll get Reggie to take it off.

12:35.261 --> 12:37.145
See, that's what I mean.

12:37.147 --> 12:39.514
On your Earth, you are
stronger than Google.

12:39.516 --> 12:41.432
I been looking forward
to this date for a week.

12:41.434 --> 12:42.767
I changed my shirt three times.

12:42.769 --> 12:44.102
My uncle's still laughing.

12:44.104 --> 12:46.237
- And that's what you went with?
- What?

12:46.239 --> 12:47.739
- What is that?
- A feather? A wave?

12:47.741 --> 12:48.906
It's a fuckin' dope-ass shirt.

12:48.908 --> 12:50.158
I'm just messing with you.

12:50.160 --> 12:52.276
Let's be sensible, shake hands,

12:52.278 --> 12:54.329
and part friends, okay?

12:54.331 --> 12:56.581
I'm not gonna try to lawyer you on this.

12:56.583 --> 12:58.783
I was raised a woman says no, it's no,

12:58.785 --> 13:00.752
even if it was a yes originally.

13:00.754 --> 13:02.036
I said no originally.

13:02.038 --> 13:03.955
About 11 times, as I recall.

13:03.957 --> 13:06.007
And then you lawyered me into a yes,

13:06.009 --> 13:07.258
which was against my better judgment,

13:07.260 --> 13:09.510
which is back now.

13:09.512 --> 13:11.379
Okay, Allison. I will be on my way,

13:11.381 --> 13:13.297
and I'm sorry it didn't work out.

13:22.776 --> 13:25.643
I just gotta say, when I saw
you, I understood the Trojan War.

13:25.645 --> 13:27.979
- What?
- Some more Greek shit that I been reading about.

13:27.981 --> 13:29.530
The King of Sparta, something with an "A,"

13:29.532 --> 13:31.733
was in love with Helen,
who ran away with a Trojan.

13:31.735 --> 13:33.651
Not a condom, a guy
from Troy. I understand.

13:33.653 --> 13:35.486
And this guy was willing
to send his whole navy,

13:35.488 --> 13:37.655
a thousand ships, just to get her back,

13:37.657 --> 13:39.741
because he had an instinct that
they were supposed to be together,

13:39.743 --> 13:41.909
even though in the face
of it it didn't make sense.

13:41.911 --> 13:43.995
- So what happened?
- I don't know. I haven't gotten that far.

13:43.997 --> 13:46.297
But I have an instinct, and I'm
willing to send all my ships.

13:46.299 --> 13:47.965
Look me in the eye and tell me

13:47.967 --> 13:49.500
that you don't have an instinct, too.

13:49.502 --> 13:51.969
- I'm a practical person.
- That's not what I asked you.

13:51.971 --> 13:54.172
Hey, Cam, it was really nice to meet you.

13:54.174 --> 13:56.090
And I wish you well. I really do.

13:56.092 --> 13:58.342
And take care of your knee, okay?

14:00.647 --> 14:02.980
Okay.

14:09.022 --> 14:12.273
A few weeks ago, I realized why
I started playing basketball.

14:12.275 --> 14:14.158
- Because you were good at it?
- No.

14:14.160 --> 14:15.860
- Because you love it?
- No.

14:15.862 --> 14:17.078
- To make money?
- No.

14:17.080 --> 14:18.946
- To get out of Dorchester.
- No.

14:18.948 --> 14:21.699
- To be famous.
- No. To meet you.

14:41.554 --> 14:43.723
Google says you like
food trucks. That true?

14:45.725 --> 14:48.526
That last one got you, huh?

14:48.528 --> 14:52.280
Yeah. It was pretty good.

15:04.410 --> 15:06.043
How about that bike there?

15:06.045 --> 15:07.912
No, that bike's a piece of shit.

15:07.914 --> 15:10.748
My bike's expensive. My
nephew bought it for me.

15:10.750 --> 15:12.166
Well, keep your eyes open

15:12.168 --> 15:14.719
and try to err on the side of prosecution.

15:15.805 --> 15:17.755
Hey, how you holding up back there, Julius?

15:17.757 --> 15:21.676
Oh, fine. The seat ain't
that bad without handcuffs on.

15:23.346 --> 15:24.846
You new to the neighborhood?

15:24.848 --> 15:27.181
I'm new to the neighborhood,
new to the South.

15:27.183 --> 15:28.816
I'm from Boston.

15:28.818 --> 15:30.985
- Boston?
- Yeah, Boston, man.

15:30.987 --> 15:33.771
Oh, fuck the Celtics. Fuck
the Red Sox while you're at it.

15:33.773 --> 15:35.072
I would say fuck you,

15:35.074 --> 15:37.275
but I'm in the back seat behind a cage.

15:37.277 --> 15:39.610
- Uh-huh. And we can still cuff you.
- Yeah.

15:39.612 --> 15:42.246
There's only one thing
I wish I could do, man.

15:42.248 --> 15:44.699
- What's that?
- Fuck a cop's wife.

15:44.701 --> 15:47.034
Is this the right street we on, man?

15:47.036 --> 15:49.337
Say, fellas, look. I gotta take a dump.

15:49.339 --> 15:50.838
We need to make a pit stop.

15:50.840 --> 15:52.456
We call that a shit stop.

15:52.458 --> 15:55.209
Whatever you call it,
the shit is calling me.

15:55.211 --> 15:56.544
I need a bathroom now.

15:56.546 --> 15:59.130
All right. We call that an emergency.

16:09.392 --> 16:11.809
How do you know Chen even likes dumplings?

16:11.811 --> 16:14.729
- The man is Chinese.
- That doesn't mean that he li...

16:14.731 --> 16:16.364
Oh, what the fuck am
I supposed to make him?

16:16.366 --> 16:18.316
Fondue? Bratwurst?

16:18.318 --> 16:20.151
The man is Chinese. I'm
making him Chinese food.

16:20.153 --> 16:21.702
You see his eyes and his hair.

16:21.704 --> 16:23.905
What you trying to say,
the dude ain't Chinese?

16:23.907 --> 16:25.907
I... I'm not. You not.

16:28.244 --> 16:31.495
- Nobody get up.
- Not my house.

16:31.497 --> 16:33.214
I guess what I'm trying to say

16:33.216 --> 16:37.001
is how would you feel if Chen
tried to woo you with fried chicken?

16:37.003 --> 16:39.637
I would only be offended if
the chicken wasn't on point.

16:39.639 --> 16:42.491
That's why my dumpling
game has got to be tight.

16:43.893 --> 16:47.429
Oh, there she is. Fresh
off the gossip session.

16:48.431 --> 16:50.681
I love you, Mother.

16:50.683 --> 16:52.183
Chuck, you look really happy.

16:52.185 --> 16:53.601
It's nice.

16:53.603 --> 16:56.020
I'm so used to see you
smile at disturbing shit.

16:56.022 --> 16:57.605
Well, thank you, Missy.

16:57.607 --> 16:59.190
It is nice to finally be
able to have a platform

16:59.192 --> 17:01.025
to express the nuances of my soul.

17:01.027 --> 17:03.494
And to think it only took
the real threat of jail.

17:03.496 --> 17:05.029
Well, as my therapist says,

17:05.031 --> 17:06.196
it's not how I got here,

17:06.199 --> 17:08.165
it's how I get now.

17:08.166 --> 17:09.584
That really means something to you?

17:09.586 --> 17:11.452
Man, these people are thieves,

17:11.454 --> 17:14.589
charging you money to
spew bullshit like that.

17:15.592 --> 17:17.508
What else y'all talk about?

17:17.510 --> 17:19.844
I'd like to keep that
between me and my therapist.

17:19.846 --> 17:22.128
The discoveries that
build me up in the process

17:22.131 --> 17:24.432
might sometimes tear others down,

17:24.434 --> 17:26.550
so I have to, uh, tread lightly.

17:26.551 --> 17:29.553
- That's smart.
- Yeah, I mean, you just quoted your therapist.

17:29.555 --> 17:32.390
That was between you and
everybody in the kitchen.

17:32.392 --> 17:33.891
Therapy is good.

17:33.893 --> 17:35.226
There was a point in my life

17:35.228 --> 17:36.811
when I was in therapy twice a week.

17:36.813 --> 17:38.196
Twice a week?

17:38.198 --> 17:40.564
So you basically spend your
sessions shitting on me, don't you?

17:40.566 --> 17:43.150
I could read between the fuckin' lines.

17:43.152 --> 17:44.535
Hostility is not worth engaging.

17:44.537 --> 17:45.870
That is a lesson I learned.

17:45.872 --> 17:48.155
Well, you walk in here all smug and shit,

17:48.157 --> 17:50.207
talking like you a fuckin' shaman

17:50.209 --> 17:52.326
after court-ordered therapy,

17:52.328 --> 17:53.995
and I'm calling bullshit.

17:53.997 --> 17:57.248
And I understand now that
my happiness upsets you.

17:57.250 --> 17:59.417
- The fuck you sayin' to me.
- You fuckin' heard me.

17:59.419 --> 18:01.941
I am your shoulder when
you need someone to lean on,

18:01.942 --> 18:04.655
and I am your punching bag when
you need someone to beat up.

18:04.774 --> 18:06.757
You know, I think you hit your head

18:06.759 --> 18:08.392
on that fuckin' therapist couch,

18:08.394 --> 18:10.811
'cause obviously you don't realize

18:10.813 --> 18:13.230
and have forgotten who has supported you

18:13.232 --> 18:15.316
through the thickest and the thinnest.

18:15.318 --> 18:17.318
Who fuckin' changed your Pampers,

18:17.320 --> 18:18.769
who wiped your fuckin' ass.

18:18.771 --> 18:22.073
Who worked 20 fuckin' hours
for you and your bother.

18:22.075 --> 18:23.658
Who the fuck are you talking to?

18:23.660 --> 18:25.109
I... I... I would like a dumpling.

18:25.111 --> 18:26.494
Is that how you remember it?

18:26.496 --> 18:28.195
Because what I remember is you hitting me

18:28.197 --> 18:29.697
over petty bullshit one minute,

18:29.699 --> 18:31.866
and then the next minute you crying to me

18:31.868 --> 18:33.617
over the fucked-up state of your life,

18:33.619 --> 18:36.454
and I was a part of that
state you were crying over.

18:36.456 --> 18:38.873
And I remember raising
Cam while you were working.

18:38.875 --> 18:40.291
I was working.

18:40.293 --> 18:41.509
That don't change the fact I had to act

18:41.511 --> 18:43.544
like I was 26 when I was 13,

18:43.546 --> 18:45.046
and not even so much as a "thank you"

18:45.048 --> 18:46.630
for being a good daughter.

18:46.632 --> 18:48.215
Mary-Charles, the fact
that you standing here

18:48.217 --> 18:50.134
in my fuckin' face as
a grown-ass woman alive

18:50.136 --> 18:52.186
is my fuckin' thank you.

18:52.188 --> 18:53.888
This is some bullshit.

18:53.890 --> 18:57.224
You know what? Maybe,
but you need to know this.

18:57.226 --> 19:01.145
For a lot of years, the thing
that you were best at as a mother

19:01.147 --> 19:03.030
was making me feel worthless,

19:03.032 --> 19:04.482
and there ain't no do-overs.

19:04.484 --> 19:07.118
Just admitting it and moving on.

19:14.711 --> 19:16.327
What were you in therapy for?

19:16.329 --> 19:19.046
Not you.

19:23.219 --> 19:25.503
A thief matching you and
your buddy's description

19:25.505 --> 19:27.471
stole a bike and is still in the area.

19:27.473 --> 19:31.342
My description? What? Handsome and buff?

19:31.344 --> 19:32.593
You kids have a choice.

19:32.595 --> 19:33.928
You can stop talking shit,

19:33.930 --> 19:36.013
or you can find yourself
face down in handcuffs.

19:36.015 --> 19:37.848
Who's talking shit? You're talking shit.

19:37.850 --> 19:39.350
I'm just listening to your shit.

19:39.352 --> 19:40.985
Why would any of us steal a dusty-ass bike?

19:40.987 --> 19:43.821
'Cause that's what you
boys do. Ain't it, boy?

19:43.823 --> 19:45.906
- Boy?
- Boys? What's that supposed to mean?

19:45.908 --> 19:48.576
Look, the blond guy who
took the bike ain't here.

19:48.578 --> 19:50.578
This guy's got frosted tips. Look.

19:50.580 --> 19:52.079
They're highlights.

19:52.081 --> 19:53.664
Take your asses home.

19:53.666 --> 19:56.200
Yeah. And read a book while you're there.

19:56.202 --> 19:57.918
A long one.

20:01.791 --> 20:04.091
You know what, guys? I don't need no bike.

20:04.093 --> 20:05.209
I'm thinking about getting a moped

20:05.211 --> 20:06.377
or a skateboard or something.

20:06.379 --> 20:07.628
Let's just let it go.

20:07.630 --> 20:09.547
What, and let the thieves win?

20:09.549 --> 20:10.881
Just for tonight.

20:10.883 --> 20:12.550
- All right. If you say so.
- All right.

20:12.552 --> 20:13.601
You wanna get something to eat first?

20:13.603 --> 20:15.052
Yeah, let's go on in there.

20:15.054 --> 20:16.887
I gotta, you know, pay
homage to this business,

20:16.889 --> 20:18.889
'cause I just blew they toilet up.

20:29.502 --> 20:32.119
Oh, whoa, whoa. Sometimes
that is a beautiful noise.

20:32.121 --> 20:34.455
This is Reggie. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Go ahead.

20:34.457 --> 20:36.957
Uh-huh. Yeah.

20:36.959 --> 20:38.492
Don't beat yourself up.

20:38.494 --> 20:41.962
We all get upset and say
things that we didn't mean.

20:41.964 --> 20:45.749
When Mary-Charles gets upset,
she says exactly what she means.

20:45.751 --> 20:48.419
That child always did enjoy drawing blood.

20:48.421 --> 20:49.720
Therapists are often wrong.

20:49.722 --> 20:52.306
Mine said I had an Electra complex.

20:52.308 --> 20:54.091
Fuck is that?

20:54.093 --> 20:56.594
It's where you wanna fuck your
father and pussy-block your mother.

20:56.596 --> 20:58.312
Well, was it true?

20:59.765 --> 21:01.015
I mean, it was close, though.

21:01.017 --> 21:02.399
I wanted to pussy-block my father

21:02.401 --> 21:04.435
and get my mother laid.

21:04.437 --> 21:07.905
I just don't like being found
guilty by a judge who should know.

21:07.907 --> 21:09.273
None of us do.

21:09.275 --> 21:11.609
All right, set down your breakables.

21:11.611 --> 21:13.110
Why? What happened now?

21:13.112 --> 21:15.196
That was Clay Beckwith.
He got a call from the DA.

21:15.198 --> 21:18.782
Mary-Charles has not shown up for
one single therapy appointment.

21:18.784 --> 21:20.751
- What?
- Therapist couldn't pick her out of a lineup.

21:20.753 --> 21:22.670
Which is ironic, because
if she doesn't start going,

21:22.672 --> 21:24.088
she's gonna be in a lineup.

21:24.090 --> 21:26.173
When did the state of
Georgia become so passionate

21:26.175 --> 21:27.675
about black girls' mental health?

21:27.677 --> 21:29.793
It's a violation of her
agreement with the DA,

21:29.795 --> 21:32.096
and if she keeps this up, they're
gonna send her to Reidsville.

21:32.098 --> 21:33.297
- Jeez.
- I know.

21:33.299 --> 21:35.716
I mean, she just went on and on.

21:35.718 --> 21:37.718
Stood right there where you are.

21:37.720 --> 21:39.803
One of the best liars you'll
ever meet. Always has been.

21:39.805 --> 21:42.806
Now obviously she has some
issues with professional help.

21:42.808 --> 21:44.942
I don't know what they are.
Right now, I don't care.

21:44.944 --> 21:47.945
Our job is to tag-team this
shit. Get her on the couch.

21:47.947 --> 21:50.197
And she ain't gotta say a word to
that doctor if she don't want to.

21:50.199 --> 21:51.866
Hell, she can sing karaoke,

21:51.868 --> 21:54.318
but one way or another, she will
punch the clock of well-being.

21:54.320 --> 21:55.953
Aunt Cass, are you hearing me?

21:55.955 --> 21:59.456
Oh, I knew she wasn't my fault.

21:59.458 --> 22:02.376
She always did have a great imagination.

22:06.132 --> 22:09.968
I swear, root beer be fuckin'
me up like the real beer.

22:10.670 --> 22:14.338
Sugar's the sweetest drug.

22:14.340 --> 22:16.557
Shit. There he is.

22:16.559 --> 22:18.726
Stop! Freeze!

22:28.688 --> 22:29.853
Put your hands in the air.

22:29.855 --> 22:31.322
You done made the wrong turn,

22:31.324 --> 22:32.690
and now we done caught you, Pac-Man.

22:32.692 --> 22:35.075
I said put your hands in the air.

22:35.077 --> 22:36.360
Higher.

22:36.362 --> 22:37.695
I literally can't raise them any higher.

22:37.697 --> 22:39.079
I didn't do anything wrong.

22:39.081 --> 22:41.749
- Why were you running?
- Because you were chasing.

22:41.751 --> 22:43.334
Innocent people don't run.

22:43.336 --> 22:44.668
Man, you ain't gotta steal my shit.

22:44.670 --> 22:46.503
You blond. You don't need my shit.

22:46.505 --> 22:47.922
I didn't do anything to you.

22:47.924 --> 22:51.175
You should handle this
one, for obvious reasons.

22:51.177 --> 22:52.876
Huh. Nice.

22:52.878 --> 22:55.629
Nicely handled.

22:55.631 --> 22:57.047
Oh, come on, man. We cool.

22:57.049 --> 22:58.549
He wasn't running from the three of us.

22:58.551 --> 23:00.884
He's not running now, is he?

23:00.886 --> 23:02.720
Oh, shit. That ain't even my bike.

23:02.722 --> 23:05.105
That's the wrong bike.
The kid is innocent, man.

23:05.107 --> 23:07.725
No, no, no, no. He's guilty of something.

23:07.727 --> 23:09.276
Yeah, kid looking like that,

23:09.278 --> 23:10.894
riding around here all by himself.

23:10.896 --> 23:13.230
He's bound to shoot up a
school or something eventually.

23:13.232 --> 23:15.282
We just saved a bunch of other little kids.

23:15.284 --> 23:17.901
Yeah, some teachers.
And a custodian or two.

23:17.903 --> 23:19.320
Lunch lady.

23:19.322 --> 23:21.488
- Oh, yeah?
- You're lucky, kid.

23:21.490 --> 23:23.874
Real lucky.

23:23.876 --> 23:25.376
We should probably get rolling.

23:25.378 --> 23:27.161
Julius, you coming with us, right?

23:27.163 --> 23:29.463
No, I think I dropped
a cell phone back here.

23:29.465 --> 23:31.081
Thanks, though.

23:31.083 --> 23:32.049
Be cool.

23:35.471 --> 23:37.254
Be cool too, kid.

23:37.256 --> 23:39.173
Take about four Advil.
You'll be fine in the morning.

24:02.698 --> 24:04.365
Kid, come on. Come on. Get up.

24:04.367 --> 24:06.784
Kid, get up. Come on. Get up.

24:06.786 --> 24:08.669
You get any video of that?

24:08.671 --> 24:10.120
Nah, I ain't get no video.

24:10.122 --> 24:12.589
I try to stay hands-free around the police.

24:12.591 --> 24:13.627
They fucked you up, man.

24:16.629 --> 24:18.595
Excuse the barbecue sauce.

24:18.597 --> 24:20.764
Did you get their badge numbers?

24:20.766 --> 24:22.683
No, I didn't.

24:22.685 --> 24:24.268
Oh, God. I didn't steal anything.

24:24.270 --> 24:26.103
Ever?

24:26.105 --> 24:28.806
A York Peppermint Pattie when
I was, like, six-years-old,

24:28.808 --> 24:31.525
but that... that doesn't
make me, like, a bad kid.

24:31.527 --> 24:33.394
Like, in life.

24:33.396 --> 24:35.529
Oh, God. They broke my nose.

24:35.531 --> 24:36.814
I can't even breathe.

24:36.816 --> 24:39.201
Look, if you walking and you talking,

24:41.203 --> 24:44.321
then you can breathe.

24:44.323 --> 24:46.874
God, that was so fucked up.

24:46.876 --> 24:49.126
Sometimes that's how things go.

24:49.128 --> 24:50.794
Just grin and bear it, young'un.

24:50.796 --> 24:54.465
Just grin and bear it. You like gelato?

24:54.467 --> 24:56.550
What's that?

24:56.552 --> 24:58.302
Italian ice cream.

24:58.304 --> 24:59.503
I never had it.

24:59.505 --> 25:02.040
Do you like black girls?

25:02.842 --> 25:05.259
I know where the black
girls and the gelato is.

25:05.261 --> 25:06.727
Okay.

25:06.729 --> 25:08.595
Okay? Motherfucker, what you mean "okay"?

25:08.597 --> 25:10.064
Okay.

25:10.066 --> 25:11.849
Come on.

25:16.856 --> 25:19.523
- What do you say?
- Thank you, Mr. Calloway.

25:19.525 --> 25:21.909
All good. Now go to bed, all right?

25:21.911 --> 25:23.527
Can't stay in school if
you're late to school.

25:23.529 --> 25:25.829
Yes, you can. You just stay late.

25:25.831 --> 25:27.414
You know, you're a pretty smart kid.

25:27.416 --> 25:31.034
- Thank you.
- Bye.

25:31.036 --> 25:32.753
On the house, Mr. Calloway.

25:32.755 --> 25:34.538
You sure? 'Cause, I
mean, I'd rather just...

25:34.540 --> 25:37.374
Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait.

25:38.844 --> 25:41.211
Ah, there you go. Paid in full.

25:41.213 --> 25:42.429
All right.

25:42.431 --> 25:43.630
Take care, Mr. Calloway.

25:43.632 --> 25:46.467
Yeah. You, too.

25:46.469 --> 25:48.218
Do you wanna be invisible ever?

25:48.220 --> 25:51.688
I've been invisible.
I'm happy being visible.

25:51.690 --> 25:54.358
When I'm unhappy, I just stay home.

25:54.360 --> 25:57.311
You know, most people just
want an excuse to smile.

25:57.313 --> 25:59.196
I'm happy to give 'em one.

25:59.198 --> 26:01.732
It ain't gonna be that way forever.

26:01.734 --> 26:05.652
You at peace with that?
With it ending someday?

26:05.654 --> 26:09.206
Tonight I am.

26:14.296 --> 26:15.879
Ooh.

26:15.881 --> 26:17.581
Ow!

26:17.583 --> 26:20.467
Ooh, shit.

26:20.469 --> 26:23.587
- You okay, ma'am?
- Oh, I never saw him.

26:23.589 --> 26:25.172
Here, I got you.

26:25.174 --> 26:26.390
- Ready?
- Uh-huh.

26:26.392 --> 26:29.393
One, two, three.

26:33.849 --> 26:35.182
Can you... yeah.

26:35.184 --> 26:37.670
Oh, thank you. You are quite strong.

26:39.572 --> 26:41.355
Thanks.

26:41.357 --> 26:42.656
I think it's a fracture.

26:42.658 --> 26:44.858
Are you in the medical arts,

26:44.860 --> 26:46.493
or do you just like wearing the clothes?

26:46.495 --> 26:48.245
The first one.

26:48.247 --> 26:49.580
Imagine being so lucky

26:49.582 --> 26:51.334
and so unlucky at the same time.

26:54.336 --> 26:55.919
Hey, I saw the whole thing.

26:55.921 --> 26:56.920
I'm gonna go to my car, call it in,

26:56.922 --> 26:58.172
get you an ambulance.

26:58.174 --> 26:59.706
And we'll stay with her until they come.

26:59.708 --> 27:02.176
Hey. How you doing, man?

27:02.178 --> 27:04.595
Just fine. Hi, nice to meet you.

27:04.597 --> 27:06.513
Yeah. All right.

27:09.018 --> 27:10.717
Keep it elevated, right?

27:10.719 --> 27:11.935
That's right.

27:11.937 --> 27:14.438
Should I know you, young man?

27:14.440 --> 27:16.640
Um, no, ma'am. I'm Cameron.

27:16.642 --> 27:17.858
Barbara.

27:17.860 --> 27:19.610
This is Allison.

27:19.612 --> 27:23.447
How long you two been married?

27:23.449 --> 27:25.315
We... we're not married.

27:25.317 --> 27:27.484
Really? That's amazing.

27:27.486 --> 27:28.819
It is?

27:28.821 --> 27:30.787
Don't you know how you are together?
