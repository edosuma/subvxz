00:07.387 --> 00:09.128
NARRATOR:
In the criminal justice system

00:09.189 --> 00:13.069
the people are represented by two
separate yet equally important groups,

00:13.126 --> 00:14.901
the police
who investigate crime

00:14.961 --> 00:17.840
and the district attorneys
who prosecute the offenders.

00:17.898 --> 00:18.899
These are their stories.

00:23.003 --> 00:24.380
(MOANING)

00:28.075 --> 00:32.046
WOMAN: Mr. Feltz.
(MOANING) Mr. Feltz.

00:32.112 --> 00:33.318
(DOOR OPENING)

00:34.081 --> 00:35.651
Housekeeping.

00:36.216 --> 00:38.287
Huh? What are you
doing in here?

00:38.352 --> 00:39.592
WOMAN: Mr. Feltz, do something!
Get out of here!

00:39.653 --> 00:41.132
Señor, I'm sorry!
Can't you read the sign?

00:41.188 --> 00:43.134
Señor, I'm sorry! I'm sorry!
Don't you understand English!

00:43.190 --> 00:46.399
Get out. Just shut that door and
get out of here! Get out of here!

00:46.960 --> 00:49.907
(MIMICKING) "Mr.
Feltz, Mr. Feltz!"

00:49.963 --> 00:50.964
(GIGGLING)

00:53.133 --> 00:54.578
I get next.

Housekeeping.

01:11.518 --> 01:15.591
(WHISPERING)
Mary? Mary?

01:18.024 --> 01:19.662
Call Mr. Mendoza.

01:20.560 --> 01:21.834
OFFICER: Somebody
got attacked.

01:21.895 --> 01:22.930
BRISCOE: No kidding.

01:22.996 --> 01:23.997
Any witnesses?

01:24.064 --> 01:25.134
High turnover
in this place.

01:25.198 --> 01:28.008
Couple next door are just here
for the "businessman's special."

01:28.068 --> 01:29.547
They didn't
hear a thing.

01:29.603 --> 01:30.673
How about you?

01:30.737 --> 01:31.772
I came on at 6:00.

01:31.838 --> 01:34.512
I didn't see anybody
leave this room.

01:34.574 --> 01:35.848
Any blood trail?

01:35.909 --> 01:37.115
No blood in the hallways,

01:37.177 --> 01:40.454
elevators or fire escape.
Just in here and in the bathroom.

01:40.514 --> 01:42.289
How much, you figure?

01:42.349 --> 01:44.625
Hard to say.
Over a pint.

01:44.785 --> 01:46.321
So more than
a nosebleed.

01:46.386 --> 01:47.888
Somebody got hurt.

01:49.456 --> 01:52.300
The room is registered to a
Warren Talbert. No address.

01:52.659 --> 01:53.694
How'd he pay?
Cash.

01:53.760 --> 01:56.206
But we took a credit card
imprint for incidentals.

01:56.263 --> 01:57.537
Like sheets
and mattresses?

01:57.597 --> 01:58.837
This is nothing.

01:58.899 --> 02:01.675
Last year, we had an
elderly couple from Tokyo.

02:01.735 --> 02:03.476
Found a dead hooker
under their bed.

02:03.537 --> 02:06.279
Yeah, that's why the precinct
holds its Christmas party here.

02:06.339 --> 02:07.682
Gonna need that credit
card number, all right?

02:07.741 --> 02:08.741
Yeah.

02:08.809 --> 02:10.413
Well, I already
checked under the bed.

02:58.767 --> 03:03.011
He checked in before 10:00 last night.
My shift ends at 10:00.

03:03.972 --> 03:05.315
He had a reservation.

03:05.374 --> 03:06.512
What'd he look like?

03:06.575 --> 03:09.283
Early 20s,
fairly tall, blonde.

03:09.344 --> 03:11.483
He was
pretty good-looking.

03:11.680 --> 03:13.421
Okay. You'll come down
to the station

03:13.482 --> 03:15.257
and talk
to a sketch artist.

03:15.317 --> 03:16.557
Sure.

03:16.618 --> 03:18.393
Was he with anybody?
He might have been,

03:18.453 --> 03:20.194
but you can't see
the elevators from here.

03:20.255 --> 03:21.325
Thanks.

03:21.390 --> 03:24.735
Credit card company says Warren
Talbert is a 48-year-old architect,

03:24.793 --> 03:27.865
lives on the Upper East Side,
pays off his bill each month.

03:27.929 --> 03:31.342
Well, that Warren Talbert misses this
Warren Talbert by about 30 years.

03:31.400 --> 03:32.777
Card could be stolen.
Yeah,

03:32.834 --> 03:35.576
unless Warren had
a friend check him in.

03:38.540 --> 03:40.247
The credit card
company called me,

03:40.308 --> 03:41.810
I guess after
they spoke to you.

03:41.877 --> 03:43.322
I checked my wallet,
my desk.

03:43.378 --> 03:45.984
I called my wife to look around at home.
The card's gone.

03:46.214 --> 03:47.215
Anybody else
have access to it?

03:47.282 --> 03:48.283
No.

03:48.350 --> 03:50.421
When was the last time
you used it?

03:50.485 --> 03:52.487
Oh, maybe
over a month.

03:52.854 --> 03:54.527
You know, I've had
cards stolen before.

03:54.589 --> 03:56.432
They never sent detectives.

03:56.491 --> 03:59.199
A young man used your card
at the Carrington Hotel.

03:59.261 --> 04:01.332
He might be involved
in a more serious crime.

04:01.396 --> 04:03.069
Where were you
last night, Mr. Talbert?

04:04.566 --> 04:07.172
I was at the Met
humming along to Rigoletto,

04:07.235 --> 04:09.010
with my wife
and another couple.

04:09.071 --> 04:11.813
My secretary will
give you their names.

04:12.307 --> 04:14.753
The other couple at the
opera confirmed his story.

04:14.810 --> 04:17.517
Nothing at the morgue.
We had a couple of bleeders

04:17.579 --> 04:20.321
walk into Saint Vincent's, but
they were the wrong blood type.

04:20.382 --> 04:22.589
Preliminaries from
the lab said it's type O.

04:22.717 --> 04:24.754
And we got a lot of prints
in that hotel room.

04:24.820 --> 04:26.265
We're going to
need more help.

04:26.388 --> 04:30.063
For stolen plastic?
We'll mobilize the National Guard.

04:30.125 --> 04:31.468
It's from
the credit card company.

04:31.526 --> 04:33.005
Thanks.

04:34.062 --> 04:36.269
When did Talbert say
he last used the card?

04:36.331 --> 04:37.810
About a month ago.

04:37.866 --> 04:41.746
New Editions Bookstore.
$332. Last weekend.

04:44.372 --> 04:46.215
Sorry. I couldn't tell you
if I saw him.

04:46.274 --> 04:48.117
Sunday night
was very busy.

04:48.176 --> 04:51.055
We had a reading of a cyber-novel
by Carlton Van Dusen.

04:51.113 --> 04:52.114
One Hand Typing.

04:52.180 --> 04:53.181
Racy stuff.

04:53.415 --> 04:56.919
Sure, until you see Van Dusen.
400 sweaty pounds.

04:56.985 --> 04:58.396
Cleaned out
the pastry platter.

04:58.453 --> 05:01.559
Well, our guy bought
over $300 worth of books.

05:01.990 --> 05:02.991
Hmm.

05:03.158 --> 05:06.867
Still doesn't ring a bell.
You have his credit card number?

05:13.568 --> 05:14.603
(COMPUTER BEEPS)

05:14.669 --> 05:18.242
Here he is.
Warren Talbert, Sunday, 5:15 p.m.

05:18.306 --> 05:22.982
Thoreau, Walden, soft cover,
$7.95 plus tax. Hegel, $8.98.

05:23.812 --> 05:25.655
There's another
15 books here.

05:25.714 --> 05:26.886
Could you
print that out?

05:26.948 --> 05:28.052
Sure.

05:29.284 --> 05:32.265
Look at this, Nietzsche,
Wittgenstein, Kierkegaard.

05:32.320 --> 05:34.391
Either we're looking
for a philosophy student,

05:34.456 --> 05:37.096
or we got one very
depressed criminal.

05:37.359 --> 05:39.566
I wonder
if Talbert has kids.

05:39.861 --> 05:42.603
We have one daughter.
Christina. She's 17.

05:42.664 --> 05:45.304
She's on an academic scholarship
at Hudson University.

05:45.767 --> 05:47.246
Same neighborhood
as the Carrington.

05:47.302 --> 05:48.713
And you think
my daughter's involved?

05:48.770 --> 05:51.444
Well, our credit card thief has
an atypical spending pattern.

05:51.506 --> 05:54.214
No electronics,
no jewelry, no clothes.

05:54.276 --> 05:57.621
Usually they max out the
card, and not on books.

05:57.679 --> 06:00.387
We're thinking this thief is a
classmate of your daughter's.

06:00.448 --> 06:01.825
I never gave her the card.

06:01.917 --> 06:04.591
Is it possible she might have
borrowed it, and lent it to a friend?

06:04.920 --> 06:06.593
No. Not Christina.

06:06.888 --> 06:10.062
Our daughter's a good girl.
She's very focused on her studies.

06:10.125 --> 06:13.163
She wouldn't be mixed up
in anything criminal.

06:13.929 --> 06:15.431
I don't know
who this is.

06:15.497 --> 06:16.976
Take another look.

06:18.366 --> 06:19.743
It could be anybody.

06:19.801 --> 06:21.439
You know, I think
Christina might be able

06:21.503 --> 06:24.814
to focus better without
any distractions. You mind?

06:26.908 --> 06:29.946
Thanks. Christina, why
don't you sit down here?

06:34.849 --> 06:38.888
Uh, right now, your father's credit
card is our only connection to a crime.

06:39.387 --> 06:41.890
Well, it's Dad's card.
I never use it.

06:41.957 --> 06:45.200
How about you write down the names of
your friends at Hudson University.

06:46.461 --> 06:49.340
(LAUGHS) I don't want you
bothering my friends.

06:50.232 --> 06:51.506
Are we done here?

06:52.033 --> 06:55.037
Look, we start asking around campus,
we'll get your class schedule,

06:55.103 --> 06:57.276
the clubs you belong to,
everything you do there.

06:57.339 --> 06:59.910
By this time tomorrow, we'll
have a list of all your friends.

07:01.176 --> 07:03.087
Dad!

07:03.478 --> 07:05.151
Okay. Have it your way.

07:10.051 --> 07:13.191
So what did she do?
Hack her family to death in their sleep?

07:13.255 --> 07:14.563
Why would you
think that?

07:14.623 --> 07:15.897
People who're
wound that tight,

07:15.957 --> 07:17.265
you never know.

07:17.325 --> 07:19.669
Exactly how tight
are we talking?

07:20.428 --> 07:22.965
Christina answered
an ad for freelancers.

07:23.031 --> 07:27.070
I needed 500 words on the student's
committee for Tibetan independence.

07:27.135 --> 07:29.012
The next day,
it was on my desk.

07:29.070 --> 07:30.879
She wouldn't leave
until I read it.

07:30.939 --> 07:35.319
I changed six words. She got mad.
Not at me, at herself.

07:35.443 --> 07:36.945
Well, she didn't
flip out, yet.

07:37.012 --> 07:39.925
Actually, we need to
speak to her friends.

07:40.849 --> 07:42.658
Anyone in particular?

07:45.086 --> 07:48.397
Yeah. Tom Horton.
He's her boyfriend, pre-med.

07:54.462 --> 07:57.238
Oh, that's right, don't smile
back, she might bite you.

07:57.299 --> 07:58.744
Come on, Lennie,
she's just a kid.

07:58.800 --> 08:01.110
Maybe you'd rather
wait in the car.

08:01.169 --> 08:03.149
Can you check Tom Horton's
room again, please?

08:03.204 --> 08:05.548
His roommate's looking for
him in the games room.

08:05.607 --> 08:08.110
Would you ring Tom
Horton for me, please?

08:08.176 --> 08:10.053
Don't hold your breath.

08:10.278 --> 08:11.313
Who are you?

08:11.379 --> 08:12.756
CURTIS: Detectives.
Your turn.

08:13.815 --> 08:15.886
I'm Tom's lawyer.
I instructed him

08:15.950 --> 08:18.362
not to speak with you
until I got here.

08:18.987 --> 08:21.126
GARNETT: So the sketch
vaguely resembles him.

08:21.189 --> 08:23.726
He's young,
he's blond. So what?

08:23.792 --> 08:26.898
Well, if this is a case of mistaken
identity, let's get him in a line up.

08:27.162 --> 08:29.733
What's the charge, soiling linens?
No, thank you.

08:30.532 --> 08:32.443
Why didn't Christina tell us
you were her boyfriend?

08:32.500 --> 08:33.604
GARNETT: Why don't
you ask her?

08:33.668 --> 08:36.308
Hey, you mind if he answers a
question every now and then?

08:37.339 --> 08:38.750
Be my guest.

08:40.642 --> 08:42.553
Where were you
Thursday night?

08:42.610 --> 08:44.487
I went to a fraternity party
with Christina.

08:44.779 --> 08:45.917
Which one?

08:45.980 --> 08:47.050
Alpha Phi Beta.

08:48.450 --> 08:50.623
We left around 9:00.
She went to the library.

08:50.952 --> 08:52.625
CURTIS:
Where'd you go?

08:52.687 --> 08:53.893
I came back here to study.

08:54.289 --> 08:56.769
You're sure you didn't meet up with another girl?
Take her to a hotel?

08:56.825 --> 08:59.203
Okay. He's answered your questions.
interview's over.

09:05.133 --> 09:07.841
Tommy and Christina were the
first ones through the door.

09:07.902 --> 09:09.347
First ones
out the door, too.

09:09.404 --> 09:10.815
What time was that?

09:10.872 --> 09:12.476
Around 9:00.

09:13.341 --> 09:14.581
You sure?

09:14.642 --> 09:17.145
Yeah. It was half-time
at the Knicks game.

09:17.212 --> 09:18.953
We had it
on the big screen.

09:19.013 --> 09:20.651
And did Horton come back?

09:20.715 --> 09:22.319
I got pretty wasted
that night.

09:23.218 --> 09:26.722
Last thing I remember, I was
booting into a trash can.

09:26.888 --> 09:28.333
By the way, I am 21.

09:28.390 --> 09:30.427
Don't worry. We're not
going to card you.

09:30.492 --> 09:32.494
Any chance Tommy hooked
up with somebody else?

09:32.560 --> 09:35.803
Tommy? No way. No.
He's nuts about Christina.

09:36.197 --> 09:38.973
Lots of guys are nuts about somebody.
Doesn't stop them.

09:39.033 --> 09:41.639
Well, you don't know
these Wisconsin boys.

09:41.970 --> 09:43.449
They fall hard
for those milkers.

09:43.505 --> 09:44.677
Beg your pardon.

09:45.840 --> 09:49.083
Haven't you seen her?
She's on the chunky side of Ricki Lake.

09:50.578 --> 09:52.785
We talking about the same girl?
Christina Talbert?

09:52.981 --> 09:57.259
Yeah. Baggy clothes, looks like she's
packing some weight under there.

09:57.452 --> 09:58.487
Yeah, she'd be
real sweet, too,

09:58.553 --> 10:00.191
if she off-loaded
a few pounds.

10:01.923 --> 10:04.233
Maybe she did,
the other night.

10:07.195 --> 10:10.267
I think I would know if my
own daughter was pregnant.

10:11.599 --> 10:13.476
Christina
was not pregnant.

10:13.535 --> 10:15.208
VAN BUREN: Is that
true, Christina?

10:15.270 --> 10:16.305
Yes.

10:16.371 --> 10:18.942
The final lab report
came in an hour ago.

10:19.007 --> 10:22.079
Forensics found amniotic
fluid in the mattress.

10:22.143 --> 10:23.588
Do you know
what that is?

10:23.645 --> 10:26.091
Yes. It didn't
come from me.

10:26.448 --> 10:28.291
And the type O blood
in the room,

10:28.349 --> 10:30.124
that didn't come
from you either?

10:30.185 --> 10:32.688
No, it's not mine.

10:32.754 --> 10:33.824
Then what was your
boyfriend doing there?

10:33.888 --> 10:34.889
He wasn't there.

10:34.956 --> 10:35.991
He was with me.

10:36.057 --> 10:39.129
Christina, lying's only going to
make things worse for you and Tommy.

10:39.194 --> 10:41.174
If there was
a baby involved,

10:41.229 --> 10:43.539
we need to know
what happened, now.

10:45.366 --> 10:48.711
Christina, say something.

10:51.005 --> 10:54.316
Listen I have
two kids

10:54.542 --> 10:56.681
I know what it's like
to be pregnant.

10:56.744 --> 10:58.849
It can make you
do crazy things.

10:59.147 --> 11:00.854
Especially
if you're scared.

11:04.018 --> 11:05.361
Christina?

11:08.289 --> 11:11.702
Morning. I'd like to
speak to my client.

11:12.126 --> 11:13.901
Don't you represent
the boyfriend?

11:13.962 --> 11:15.464
They're both my clients.

11:15.864 --> 11:19.277
Good. Maybe you can talk
some sense into this one.

11:22.837 --> 11:24.942
I'd like to
talk to her alone.

11:27.709 --> 11:30.315
Hard to believe she didn't
know her own kid was pregnant.

11:30.378 --> 11:34.121
She didn't. You see the look she gave
when you mentioned the blood type?

11:34.182 --> 11:35.217
Now she knows.

11:35.283 --> 11:37.058
How can a mother miss
something like that?

11:37.118 --> 11:39.530
Wait till your
daughters grow up.

11:42.790 --> 11:45.430
All right. None of this
gets back to her parents.

11:45.693 --> 11:48.333
They find out and what,
no TV for a month?

11:48.396 --> 11:50.967
Christina wants to be
the one to tell them.

11:51.032 --> 11:53.603
Fine. Now she can tell us.

11:56.237 --> 11:57.443
(SIGHING)

11:58.306 --> 12:03.187
Well, I live with my parents,
and Tommy has a roommate.

12:04.078 --> 12:06.422
We went to the hotel
for privacy.

12:06.481 --> 12:08.085
What happened
in the hotel room?

12:09.517 --> 12:12.088
We started having sex,

12:14.856 --> 12:18.099
and I started bleeding,

12:21.596 --> 12:24.236
and I went
into the bathroom,

12:26.034 --> 12:28.776
and all this tissue
started coming out.

12:30.738 --> 12:31.910
She miscarried.

12:31.973 --> 12:33.816
I didn't even know
I was pregnant.

12:34.542 --> 12:35.782
How pregnant?

12:35.843 --> 12:36.844
I don't know.

12:40.648 --> 12:42.252
Two or three months.

12:42.317 --> 12:44.194
What did you do
with the fetus?

12:48.923 --> 12:51.028
I flushed it in the toilet.

12:52.293 --> 12:55.900
As you can imagine, this is
now a private, family matter.

12:59.834 --> 13:03.577
M.E.'s report. Too much blood,
and too little amniotic fluid

13:03.638 --> 13:06.710
in the hotel room for it to
be a first-trimester birth.

13:06.774 --> 13:10.153
She thinks the fetus was probably
seven or eight months along.

13:10.211 --> 13:12.157
So we're still
being lied to.

13:12.213 --> 13:15.660
I'll call the D.A. to get an order
for a medical exam of the girl.

13:21.255 --> 13:22.393
A viable baby?

13:22.457 --> 13:23.561
That's ridiculous.

13:23.625 --> 13:25.536
There's no medical
standard for this.

13:25.593 --> 13:26.833
So she bled a lot.

13:26.894 --> 13:29.101
That's why you want a doctor
to look up her dress?

13:29.163 --> 13:30.801
She's been
traumatized enough.

13:30.865 --> 13:33.607
Ms. Ross, do you have anything
besides the M.E.'s opinion?

13:34.002 --> 13:36.539
Miss Talbert consistently
lied to the police.

13:37.105 --> 13:38.345
She didn't want
her mother to know

13:38.406 --> 13:39.885
that she was having
sex with her boyfriend.

13:41.275 --> 13:43.255
Ms. Ross, come back when
you have actual evidence

13:43.311 --> 13:45.723
to justify invading
this girl's privacy.

13:48.082 --> 13:49.857
Tommy and I
don't exactly talk.

13:49.917 --> 13:52.523
No late-night
heart-to-hearts over a keg?

13:52.587 --> 13:56.000
He talks to Christina.
Christina talks to him. That's about it.

13:56.290 --> 13:57.564
You see him on
Thursday night?

13:57.625 --> 13:58.831
Yeah, at the frat house

13:59.360 --> 14:00.737
I got there about 11:00.

14:00.795 --> 14:03.332
This was 11:00?
You're sure?

14:03.398 --> 14:07.244
Everyone was pretty much wasted,
except for him and Christina.

14:07.301 --> 14:09.212
They were dancing alone
in the middle of the floor

14:09.270 --> 14:13.241
to that dumb song, Endless Love.
it's their song.

14:15.243 --> 14:16.278
(POLICE SIREN WAILS)

14:16.344 --> 14:18.119
CURTIS: We had a search of
every alley and dumpster

14:18.179 --> 14:20.386
between the hotel
and the university.

14:20.448 --> 14:22.428
If we'd have found a baby,
we would've told you.

14:22.483 --> 14:24.656
She didn't tell anybody at
school that she was pregnant.

14:24.719 --> 14:27.427
The guy who would know, the
boyfriend, won't talk to us.

14:27.555 --> 14:28.795
You're 17,
you're going to talk

14:28.856 --> 14:30.267
to somebody
besides your boyfriend.

14:30.324 --> 14:31.826
A doctor,
a best friend.

14:31.893 --> 14:33.338
We didn't get
any cooperation

14:33.394 --> 14:36.671
from her parents, so unless we can
get a peek at her address book...

14:36.731 --> 14:39.644
No probable cause for a medical
exam means no probable cause

14:39.701 --> 14:40.839
for a search warrant,
right?

14:40.902 --> 14:42.176
Not necessarily.

14:42.236 --> 14:44.682
Did Talbert file a report
for the stolen credit card?

14:44.739 --> 14:46.582
BRISCOE: The card
company did.

14:47.041 --> 14:50.750
She bought books. That's stolen goods.
Grounds for a search warrant.

14:50.812 --> 14:53.019
We'll get two,
his and hers.

14:53.681 --> 14:55.627
My husband called
the credit card company.

14:55.683 --> 14:57.594
He told them it was
a misunderstanding.

14:57.652 --> 14:59.154
They consider it stolen.

14:59.220 --> 15:00.893
This Dr. Banks,
that her gynecologist?

15:00.955 --> 15:02.161
And mine.

15:02.223 --> 15:04.601
She hasn't seen him since
her annual last August.

15:05.193 --> 15:06.228
Ten months ago.

15:06.294 --> 15:07.364
Rey.

15:07.428 --> 15:08.702
Looks like blood.

15:08.763 --> 15:10.003
Look at this.

15:11.065 --> 15:14.512
Blank prescription forms.

Oh, (CLEARING THROAT) Rey,
Thoreau and the Germans.

15:23.377 --> 15:25.448
Yes, Christina Talbert's
a patient of mine.

15:25.513 --> 15:27.515
I see a lot of students
from the university.

15:27.582 --> 15:29.186
When did she
first come in?

15:29.250 --> 15:31.457
Two months ago.
If that.

15:31.986 --> 15:34.694
She told us she was two or three
months pregnant, and she miscarried.

15:35.289 --> 15:36.791
Can you confirm that?

15:36.858 --> 15:39.304
Not without violating
doctor-patient privilege.

15:39.761 --> 15:40.899
Did she tell you
I was her doctor?

15:40.962 --> 15:41.997
CURTIS: No. We found

15:42.063 --> 15:45.374
blank sheets from your
prescription pad in her room.

15:45.900 --> 15:47.402
Any idea why
she'd have these?

15:47.468 --> 15:48.538
No.

15:48.736 --> 15:51.478
I don't understand.
I didn't prescribe her anything.

15:51.539 --> 15:53.644
Well, you keep your
prescription pad on your desk.

15:53.708 --> 15:55.016
She helped herself.

15:55.843 --> 15:57.948
Now, about this
alleged miscarriage...

15:58.012 --> 16:00.083
Look, even if
she is a thief,

16:00.148 --> 16:03.721
I'm still not going to violate
her privilege. I'm sorry.

16:05.953 --> 16:09.332
Gynecology, that's the business
I should've gone into.

16:09.390 --> 16:13.634
Hey, Lennie, she took those blank
prescription forms for a reason.

16:14.228 --> 16:17.698
Right, and I never heard of
pharmacist-patient privilege.

16:17.765 --> 16:19.301
Neither have I.

16:20.334 --> 16:23.178
Christina Talbert, oh, here we go.
Syntocinon.

16:23.237 --> 16:25.080
Five milliliter solution.
Two weeks ago.

16:25.139 --> 16:26.880
What's it for?
it's a nasal spray

16:26.941 --> 16:28.784
for mothers who have
trouble breastfeeding.

16:28.843 --> 16:30.447
What does it do
for pregnant women?

16:30.511 --> 16:31.785
Makes them
not pregnant.

16:31.846 --> 16:34.486
It's contraindicated.
It induces labor.

16:34.549 --> 16:35.960
Thanks.

16:37.285 --> 16:41.427
The stain you found on the
dress, it's blood, type O.

16:41.923 --> 16:43.630
Just one
blood type?

16:43.691 --> 16:45.329
(CHUCKLING) How many
were you expecting?

16:45.393 --> 16:47.373
He was expecting
a stork.

16:47.428 --> 16:49.840
No baby blood,
but baby feces.

16:49.897 --> 16:51.843
Meconium.
Meaning?

16:51.899 --> 16:53.503
Probably full term.

16:53.568 --> 16:54.569
Born alive?

16:54.635 --> 16:57.741
Since the meconium wasn't mixed with
amniotic fluid it had to be excreted

16:57.805 --> 16:59.910
post-birth.
It was alive.

17:01.475 --> 17:02.476
Thanks.

17:04.111 --> 17:06.717
Well, they made a reservation,
they induced the birth.

17:06.781 --> 17:08.419
We got premeditation.
We got murder.

17:08.482 --> 17:09.893
Yeah, but no body.

17:09.951 --> 17:12.295
I say we get a warrant.
Let the D.A. make it stick.

17:12.353 --> 17:13.457
Let's call Ross.

17:16.723 --> 17:20.001
He rejected the traditional,
American dream of success,

17:20.060 --> 17:23.941
and yet had as much disdain
for mediocrity as he did...

17:24.598 --> 17:27.546
Oh, don't let us interrupt,
we're just auditing.

17:28.603 --> 17:30.810
Stand up.
Stand up!

Christina Talbert,
Thomas Horton,

17:32.106 --> 17:33.244
you're under
arrest for murder.

17:33.307 --> 17:35.287
Don't worry. Somebody else
will take notes for you.

17:35.343 --> 17:36.720
You have the right
to remain silent.

can and will be used...

JUDGE: Mr. Garnett,

17:52.814 --> 17:55.488
could you tell your clients they're
not to hold hands in my courtroom.

17:55.683 --> 17:56.957
GARNETT: Yes,
Your Honor.

17:57.018 --> 17:58.258
Go ahead, Ms. Ross.

17:58.319 --> 17:59.320
What do you wanton bail?

17:59.387 --> 18:00.923
500,000 for each defendant.

18:00.988 --> 18:02.831
They have no priors, Your Honor.
They're college students.

18:02.890 --> 18:04.369
Who killed
their newborn baby.

18:04.425 --> 18:05.961
Where's the body?
Where's the evidence?

18:06.027 --> 18:09.600
That's not my problem.
I'm setting bail at 200K for each.

18:10.164 --> 18:11.404
Miss Talbert is not
to leave her home

18:11.499 --> 18:12.978
except in the presence
of a parent,

18:13.034 --> 18:15.913

to refrain from contact

18:15.970 --> 18:17.779
outside the presence
of counsel.

You don't seem to
realize why you're here.

Ms. Ross, I'm ordering
a 730 examination,

18:30.318 --> 18:32.491
I'm not convinced these two
are fit to stand trial.

18:33.221 --> 18:37.863
Of course, I understand.
I'm being charged with murdering someone.

18:39.127 --> 18:41.334
Not just someone.
Your child.

18:43.731 --> 18:45.574
I don't have a child.

18:47.168 --> 18:49.910
Do you understand
it's wrong to kill?

18:49.971 --> 18:51.006
Yes.

18:52.473 --> 18:53.577
Even babies?

18:53.641 --> 18:54.676
Yes.

18:57.812 --> 18:59.883
How do your parents feel
about you getting pregnant?

19:02.450 --> 19:04.589
My mother
won't speak to me.

19:07.155 --> 19:08.395
Why not?

19:11.626 --> 19:14.903
She's disappointed
I got pregnant.

19:16.063 --> 19:17.167
Do you think she's right?

19:17.231 --> 19:18.301
Yes.

19:19.634 --> 19:20.704
Why?

19:23.704 --> 19:26.207
Only stupid girls
get pregnant.

19:29.410 --> 19:31.083
It's embarrassing.

19:32.446 --> 19:35.552
Mom wants girl to be perfect.
Girl wants mom to be happy.

19:35.616 --> 19:37.493
Baby spoils the equation.

19:37.685 --> 19:39.096
ROSS: I don't see
what she's afraid of.

19:39.153 --> 19:41.497
There's no evidence of
physical or emotional abuse.

19:41.556 --> 19:44.093
This girl lives or dies
by her mother's approval.

19:44.158 --> 19:46.160
You take that away, she
doesn't have much else.

19:46.227 --> 19:48.935
She can't have much in the way
of human feelings either.

19:49.497 --> 19:52.171
They kill their baby,
then grieve by taking

19:52.233 --> 19:53.974
a little spin
around the dance floor.

19:54.368 --> 19:58.578
Big surprise. She's a narcissistic bitch.
Forget about remorse.

19:58.639 --> 20:01.620
To her, that baby was like a peach
pit passing through her system.

20:01.676 --> 20:03.678
Yeah.
All very illuminating.

20:03.744 --> 20:04.848
What're you telling
the judge?

20:04.912 --> 20:05.982
She knows
right from wrong,

20:06.047 --> 20:10.052
appreciates the consequences of
her actions, can assist counsel.

20:10.651 --> 20:12.756
She's cleared
for take-off.

20:14.222 --> 20:15.292
I'll send you my bill.

20:20.461 --> 20:21.462
Yeah.

20:22.663 --> 20:25.109

you're pushing uphill.

offer the lovebirds a plea?

20:28.002 --> 20:30.414
Lousy kids.
Lousy case.

Talk to their lawyer.

JACK: I'm offering first degree
manslaughter, eight-and-a-third-to-25.

20:38.880 --> 20:40.484
How quickly
can I say no?

20:41.249 --> 20:44.093
I'm putting aside the fact your
clients premeditated this killing.

20:44.151 --> 20:48.361
Says you. You wouldn't have asked us here
if your case had a snowball's chance.

20:48.589 --> 20:50.660
You wouldn't be here if
your clients were innocent.

GARNETT: The fetus,

20:52.260 --> 20:55.469
however old it was, was stillborn.
There's no crime.

20:55.529 --> 20:58.339
You're taking the position a
dead baby excreted meconium.

20:58.399 --> 21:02.404
No. I'm taking the position
you didn't find any meconium.

21:02.637 --> 21:06.312
Motion to suppress. The search was
conducted under false pretenses.

McCoy charges you with heavy breathing.

GARNETT: The warrant specified,
"books acquired with the use

21:19.086 --> 21:22.693
"of a stolen credit card or other
relevant evidence related thereto."

21:22.757 --> 21:25.363
It said books. They found books.
They seized them.

21:25.426 --> 21:26.962
As an afterthought,
Your Honor.

21:27.028 --> 21:29.508
The books were on a
bookshelf in plain sight

21:29.563 --> 21:30.837
the whole time
they were there.

21:30.898 --> 21:34.004
They searched a closet,
a dresser, a desk.

21:34.068 --> 21:35.411
I mean they were
halfway out the door

21:35.469 --> 21:37.415
when they remembered
to take the books.

21:37.471 --> 21:39.451
So they seized the books
last, instead of first.

21:39.507 --> 21:41.418
Is there a special recipe
they were supposed to follow?

21:41.475 --> 21:45.514
The warrant said books. Instead, they
took papers from an appointment book.

21:45.579 --> 21:47.820
The warrant was a pretext.
That's per se abuse.

21:47.882 --> 21:50.453
They went to Miss Talbert's room
looking for evidence of one crime,

21:50.518 --> 21:52.930
they found evidence of another.
That's called luck.

21:52.987 --> 21:55.331
It's called a scam.
The detectives knew

21:55.389 --> 21:57.926
the credit card
wasn't in fact stolen.

21:57.992 --> 22:00.598
They were acting on a complaint
from the credit card company.

22:00.661 --> 22:06.009
Yes, but they'd been told by the
credit card holder it wasn't stolen,

22:06.801 --> 22:10.248
and they already suspected Miss
Talbert in the murder case.

22:10.304 --> 22:12.181
Isn't that right?
Yes.

22:13.975 --> 22:18.515
(SIGHING) All right.
You're all very clever, but don't tell me

22:18.579 --> 22:21.822
the meconium and
the prescription forms

22:21.882 --> 22:23.555
relate to
a stolen credit card.

22:23.617 --> 22:26.860
Your Honor, the meconium was
found on a dress in the closet.

22:26.921 --> 22:30.266
A closet is a legitimate search area
for a warrant for stolen goods.

22:30.324 --> 22:34.101
You can't fault the police for finding
and seizing blood-stained clothing.

22:39.133 --> 22:42.603
I'll grant you the meconium,
Ms. Ross. it's admissible.

22:42.670 --> 22:44.877
The stolen prescription
sheets are out.

22:44.939 --> 22:47.920
You're rewarding Mr. McCoy
for his people's deception.

22:48.042 --> 22:50.921
That's tough.
We're finished.

22:50.978 --> 22:52.048
Nice save.

22:53.547 --> 22:56.460
Without evidence that she
took a drug to induce labor,

22:56.517 --> 22:58.360
there goes
premeditation.

22:58.419 --> 22:59.762
They did
reserve a room.

22:59.854 --> 23:02.334
The case was weak,
now it's weaker.

23:02.656 --> 23:04.658
Get one of them to
roll on the other.

23:04.959 --> 23:07.166
So which devil do
we make our deal with?

23:07.228 --> 23:09.970
The girl has the motive.
She's the one who didn't want the baby.

23:10.031 --> 23:12.011
Killing it was
probably her idea.

23:12.066 --> 23:14.273
And the boy is probably the
one who actually killed it,

23:14.335 --> 23:15.746
and disposed
of the body.

23:15.803 --> 23:19.114
I flipped a coin in my head.
Came up tails. Talk to the boy.

23:20.307 --> 23:23.311
That brings up another
problem, their lawyer.

23:24.345 --> 23:27.588
He'll probably veto any settlement
that implicates the girl.

23:27.648 --> 23:29.252
Her father posted bail
for both of them.

23:29.316 --> 23:31.159
He's probably paying
Garnett's fees.

23:31.352 --> 23:33.195
Get around
the lawyer.

23:37.425 --> 23:40.133
JACK: We're prepared to offer
him man two, three-to-six.

23:40.895 --> 23:43.205
He won't even look out of place
when he goes back to college.

23:43.264 --> 23:45.710
You'll knock a murder
charge down to a C felony?

23:46.067 --> 23:49.105
Let me guess, he testifies
against Miss Talbert.

23:49.837 --> 23:51.316
That's right.
I thought...

23:51.372 --> 23:54.910
No. Good day, counselors.
Thank you for coming by.

23:54.975 --> 23:57.717
That's the answer
I expected. Ms. Ross.

23:58.712 --> 24:01.693
Our motion to remove you as Mr.
Horton's attorney of record.

24:03.084 --> 24:04.256
What?

24:04.318 --> 24:05.922
We're conflicting
you out, Counselor.

24:08.889 --> 24:10.493
There is no conflict,
Your Honor.

24:10.558 --> 24:12.333
There's only
one defense position.

24:12.393 --> 24:14.430
That's because there's only
one defense attorney.

24:14.495 --> 24:17.408
My clients only want one defense attorney.
it's their decision to make.

24:17.465 --> 24:19.138
Who's to tell
them any different?

24:19.200 --> 24:22.147
Your Honor, I made a very
fair offer to Mr. Horton

24:22.203 --> 24:24.706
in return for his testimony
against Miss Talbert.

24:24.772 --> 24:28.049
How can he possibly give objective
advice regarding this offer?

24:28.109 --> 24:30.248
So fair it could
only have been made

24:30.311 --> 24:32.621
to get me yanked
as Mr. Horton's counsel.

24:32.680 --> 24:37.026
Was this a genuine offer, or was it
made solely to create a conflict?

24:37.384 --> 24:39.057
At the time,
it was a genuine offer.

24:40.087 --> 24:41.691
I see.

24:41.755 --> 24:44.395
Well, Mr. McCoy,
now you're stuck with it.

24:44.592 --> 24:47.095
Your offer is
still on the table.

24:47.962 --> 24:51.341
Now, I don't see how
having his own counsel

24:51.398 --> 24:53.742
damages Mr. Horton's
interests.

24:53.801 --> 24:55.940
Sorry, Mr. Garnett,
you're out.

24:58.706 --> 24:59.980
SHELTON: it's a good
offer, Tommy.

25:00.040 --> 25:02.281
It gives you a chance
to have a life.

25:02.343 --> 25:04.323
Mr. Garnett said they don't
have much of a case.

25:04.378 --> 25:07.086
That's why he doesn't
represent you anymore.

25:07.414 --> 25:11.294
He was right. But there's a baby
involved, you're its father,

25:11.352 --> 25:13.662
and I'm not talking out
of school when I tell you

25:13.721 --> 25:17.191
a jury is going to be awfully tempted
to reach its own conclusions

25:17.258 --> 25:18.532
and hold you
responsible.

25:18.592 --> 25:20.299
JACK: Mr. Horton,
if you take a plea,

25:20.361 --> 25:22.807
I believe Miss Talbert
will take one, too.

25:23.998 --> 25:26.535
And I'm a lot more generous
than a trial judge will be.

25:26.834 --> 25:28.507
You don't get it.

25:29.937 --> 25:32.645
If I take this deal,
I don't get a life.

25:34.475 --> 25:36.819
I get a life
without Christina.

25:39.880 --> 25:42.986
Miss Shelton, you have to do
whatever I tell you to, right?

25:43.050 --> 25:44.051
Yes.

25:47.588 --> 25:50.194
We didn't do
anything wrong.

25:50.257 --> 25:52.328
The baby was alive
when we left the room.

25:58.434 --> 26:00.971
CURTIS: At first, Miss Talbert
denied knowing Mr. Horton.

26:01.470 --> 26:03.973
Then they both denied
being at the hotel.

26:04.073 --> 26:06.747
Then Miss Talbert told us she'd
been two months pregnant

26:06.809 --> 26:08.880
and had a miscarriage.

26:09.579 --> 26:11.252
Was any of this true?

26:11.314 --> 26:12.588
No.

26:13.349 --> 26:16.296
Forensics found traces of
meconium on Miss Talbert's dress.

26:17.486 --> 26:21.229
We were told by Forensics this was
conclusive proof the baby was born alive.

26:21.824 --> 26:25.431
Yes, as we just heard
from the Medical Examiner.

26:27.463 --> 26:29.670
What, if any, efforts did
you make to find this baby?

26:29.799 --> 26:31.710
We conducted an exhaustive
search of the area

26:31.767 --> 26:33.974
between the hotel
and Hudson University.

26:34.036 --> 26:36.016
We also questioned
the Carrington Hotel staff

26:36.072 --> 26:38.109
and as many guests
as we could track down.

26:38.174 --> 26:39.915
As a result, can you
tell us what happened

26:39.976 --> 26:41.751
to Miss Talbert
and Mr. Horton's baby?

26:42.211 --> 26:44.623
I can tell you
what didn't happen.

26:44.947 --> 26:46.620
It didn't crawl
out of that room

26:46.682 --> 26:49.094
and it didn't turn up
as a foundling.

26:49.518 --> 26:52.328
It wasn't taken home by anyone
who had access to that room.

26:53.489 --> 26:54.832
Thank you.

26:56.859 --> 27:01.137
Did your investigation
include people

27:01.197 --> 27:02.904
who were registered
at the hotel

27:02.965 --> 27:05.468
under false names or
any of their guests?

27:05.635 --> 27:07.581
If they weren't there
under their own names, no.

27:07.637 --> 27:11.107
Well, the Carrington is the
kind of place, isn't it,

27:11.173 --> 27:14.279
where people sometimes don't
use their real names?

27:14.343 --> 27:16.289
Objection.
Sustained.

27:16.345 --> 27:21.488
Could one of the people you weren't
able to locate have taken the baby?

27:22.451 --> 27:24.158
Objection.
Calls for speculation.

27:24.287 --> 27:26.028
You've made your point,
Mr. Garnett.

27:26.088 --> 27:27.362
Move it along.

27:27.423 --> 27:32.065
Detective, is there anyone in your
precinct who's still working the case?

27:32.428 --> 27:36.001
CURTIS: Until we find a body, Detective
Briscoe and I are still assigned.

27:36.065 --> 27:39.376
Until that time, what is the
baby's official status?

27:42.872 --> 27:45.079
Missing. Presumed dead.

27:45.141 --> 27:47.348
That's far short of dead
beyond reasonable doubt.

27:47.410 --> 27:48.855
Objection.

27:48.911 --> 27:50.686
Withdrawn.
No more questions.

27:54.517 --> 27:56.121
TOMMY: After he was born,

27:57.887 --> 28:00.493
Christina held him
for a little while.

28:03.959 --> 28:05.836
She really loved him.

28:08.497 --> 28:11.410
She couldn't stop worrying
about her mother.

28:14.203 --> 28:15.307
So we

28:18.074 --> 28:20.054
wrapped him
in a blanket,

28:22.511 --> 28:25.754
we left him on the bed, where
the maid would find him.

28:29.685 --> 28:32.222
Then we did the hardest
thing we've ever done.

28:33.322 --> 28:35.199
We walked out of the room.

28:36.892 --> 28:39.202
Then we went back
to the fraternity.

28:40.896 --> 28:45.936
Christina, she felt sick,
and she started to bleed.

28:47.403 --> 28:49.815
She went to the bathroom,
and passed the afterbirth,

28:49.872 --> 28:52.250
and then she wanted me
to take her home.

28:52.308 --> 28:53.981
What happened next?

28:57.380 --> 28:58.882
I didn't sleep
all night.

28:59.482 --> 29:02.656
I called Christina to make
sure that she was okay.

29:02.718 --> 29:04.925
We talked
about the baby.

29:04.987 --> 29:07.228
We decided that I should
go back to the hotel.

29:09.558 --> 29:13.870
But the police
were already there,

29:16.899 --> 29:20.244
and I figured, for sure, they'd found
the baby and it'd be all right.

29:31.180 --> 29:33.126
Just so we understand you,

29:35.985 --> 29:38.295
you felt so upset,

29:38.354 --> 29:42.359
that you went back to a party
at your fraternity house?

29:45.361 --> 29:49.036
Yes. Didn't really know
where else to go.

29:49.231 --> 29:53.873
And you requested a song,
Endless Love, isn't that right?

29:54.370 --> 29:55.906
It was a special
song for us.

29:55.971 --> 29:57.473
And you danced?

29:59.708 --> 30:01.085
We were just
holding each other.

30:01.143 --> 30:02.315
On the dance floor.

30:03.779 --> 30:05.053
Isn't that called
dancing?

30:05.114 --> 30:06.354
Yeah. I guess.

30:07.149 --> 30:08.628
We both
felt really bad.

30:08.684 --> 30:11.597
So you punished yourself for
murder by having a little dance.

30:11.887 --> 30:13.525
Objection.
JUDGE BARRY: Sustained.

30:13.589 --> 30:15.933
Didn't it occur
to you to call 911,

30:15.991 --> 30:17.664
and tell the police
about your child?

30:18.294 --> 30:21.537
Yes. Christina felt sick,

30:22.965 --> 30:23.966
and I had to get her home.

30:24.066 --> 30:25.306
They don't have
a phone at her house?

30:27.336 --> 30:28.371
I didn't want to
wake up her parents.

30:28.437 --> 30:31.907
How about on the way back
to your dorm?

30:33.876 --> 30:35.287
I don't know.

30:37.079 --> 30:38.149
I was just worried
about Christina.

30:38.214 --> 30:40.524
Can you tell us
anything you did

30:41.116 --> 30:42.993
to suggest that you
had a single thought

30:43.052 --> 30:44.656
about that child
after it was born?

30:45.488 --> 30:46.523
I don't know.

30:46.589 --> 30:48.227
You're pre-med,
she's an honors student,

30:48.290 --> 30:50.736
you're intelligent,
young people.

30:51.794 --> 30:53.535
You must've given
it some thought.

30:53.596 --> 30:55.234
Objection.
Argumentative.

30:55.297 --> 30:56.537
Sustained.

30:58.434 --> 31:02.280
The truth is, you didn't give a
damn about that child, did you?

31:02.338 --> 31:04.181
You had decided
to kill your baby

31:04.240 --> 31:05.514
when you reserved
the hotel room.

31:05.574 --> 31:06.712
Objection!

31:07.376 --> 31:10.084
Enough, Mr. McCoy.
The objection is sustained.

31:13.949 --> 31:16.452
I don't have anything more
for this witness.

31:18.387 --> 31:21.197
The jury liked his
Romeo-of-the-Dairyland routine.

31:21.257 --> 31:22.634
I thought
he got creamed.

31:22.691 --> 31:24.329
Then we're tied
going into closings.

31:25.094 --> 31:26.368
You're a tough
handicapper.

31:26.428 --> 31:27.634
I'm handicapping
the jury.

31:27.696 --> 31:30.438
They keep looking over at Christina.
They like what they see.

31:30.499 --> 31:33.742
Yeah. When you're in love, the
whole world's in love with you.

31:34.069 --> 31:36.242
And she just can sit there,
all sweet and innocent.

31:36.305 --> 31:38.376
Garnett was smart not to
put her on the stand.

31:38.440 --> 31:39.612
(PAGER BEEPING)

31:39.675 --> 31:41.655
There goes
the weekend.

31:42.912 --> 31:44.482
It's Briscoe.

31:46.148 --> 31:47.923
CURTIS: Gas company
worker found it.

31:48.117 --> 31:51.360
White, male baby.
Umbilical cord still attached.

31:54.490 --> 31:56.163
Somebody dug deep
to bury it.

31:56.225 --> 31:57.295
Not really.

31:57.359 --> 32:00.033
This is backfill dumped on
top of the burial site.

32:00.362 --> 32:01.932
We had a gas leak.

32:01.997 --> 32:03.499
Had to undo a couple of
months' worth of work.

32:03.899 --> 32:05.810
He was wrapped in this.

32:06.702 --> 32:08.409
Carrington Hotel.

32:13.208 --> 32:16.519
M.E.'s report,
quick and dirty.

32:16.579 --> 32:19.788
Baby boy. Day old or less.
Born alive and healthy.

32:20.649 --> 32:23.858
Manual strangulation,
larynx was crushed.

32:24.420 --> 32:26.991
Death was instantaneous.
Bastards.

32:28.891 --> 32:30.768
They have a positive
identification?

32:31.293 --> 32:34.137
They can pull some DNA from the
amniotic fluid in the hotel room,

32:34.196 --> 32:35.641
but it's going to take
a while to run a match.

32:36.565 --> 32:39.102
I'll settle for
a blood type match.

32:40.135 --> 32:42.274
Have Detective Briscoe
and the Medical Examiner

32:42.338 --> 32:44.443
ready to testify on Monday.

32:44.974 --> 32:47.386
Notify Judge Barry
we have rebuttal witnesses.

32:47.810 --> 32:50.552
Jack, I think there's somebody else
we might want to talk to first.

32:50.913 --> 32:52.984
I spoke
to the contractor.

32:53.048 --> 32:54.857
He said the burial site
was backfilled

32:54.917 --> 32:56.692
two days after
the baby was killed.

32:57.019 --> 32:59.590
You don't think
those kids just got lucky?

32:59.922 --> 33:01.629
No one's that lucky.

33:04.560 --> 33:06.335
I'm afraid
the baby is dead.

33:07.896 --> 33:11.503
The body was found buried about
10 blocks from the hotel.

33:12.968 --> 33:16.472
It's a commercial construction
site near the West Side Highway.

33:18.774 --> 33:21.152
You know anything
about that, Mr. Talbert?

33:22.044 --> 33:23.148
Should I?

33:23.212 --> 33:25.453
Your firm did
the structural drillings.

33:26.281 --> 33:29.057
So? There were 47
sub-contractors on that job.

33:29.284 --> 33:33.198
And the contractor says you were
one of only six individuals

33:33.255 --> 33:35.496
who had keys to
the site at that time.

33:35.958 --> 33:39.098
Warren, what did you do?

33:39.161 --> 33:40.162
Sarah...
No!

33:41.196 --> 33:42.903
I want to know
what you did.

33:45.134 --> 33:46.545
(SIGHS)

33:55.611 --> 33:57.522
You were asleep
when they came home.

33:58.113 --> 34:01.754
Christina didn't look well, and
I knew something was wrong

34:03.619 --> 34:05.929
I made them tell me
what happened.

34:07.923 --> 34:12.804
They said they left the baby
in the hotel, alive.

34:18.833 --> 34:23.840
They wanted go back.
I told them it was too dangerous.

34:23.906 --> 34:27.080
I told Tommy to go home.
I sent Christina to bed.

34:29.378 --> 34:32.449
Then I drove to the hotel,
and when I got there,

34:34.683 --> 34:37.630
it was on the bed,
wrapped in a blanket.

34:38.187 --> 34:41.464
It was wheezing.
It was in trouble.

34:43.992 --> 34:47.530
I brought it to my car, but before
I could get it to a hospital,

34:50.998 --> 34:52.478
it was dead.

34:52.868 --> 34:54.313
(CRYING)

34:57.206 --> 34:59.379
I took it to the construction
site and I buried it.

35:04.279 --> 35:08.284
Our Medical Examiner has determined
that the baby was strangled.

35:11.053 --> 35:13.863
Someone choked it
with their bare hands.

35:14.690 --> 35:17.398
No! No!
It died of natural causes.

35:19.528 --> 35:22.168
Please, don't insult
our intelligence.

35:24.333 --> 35:26.574
The baby was dead when
you found it, wasn't it?

35:33.075 --> 35:34.850
I better talk
to my lawyer.

35:36.945 --> 35:39.152
Mr. Talbert's agreed to
tell you what he knows.

35:39.214 --> 35:41.091
He has only one condition.

35:41.150 --> 35:42.254
Shoot.

35:42.317 --> 35:44.354
You drop the charges
against his daughter.

35:44.419 --> 35:46.330
In return, he'll testify
against the boy.

35:46.622 --> 35:50.195
As far as we're concerned, they're
equally guilty. Her maybe more so.

35:50.592 --> 35:54.438
Whatever. You let the girl
walk, no charges, no record.

35:54.897 --> 35:56.740
Or he doesn't
tell you squat.

35:57.733 --> 36:00.009
Let's hear
what he has to say first.

36:01.570 --> 36:03.106
Off the record.

36:06.508 --> 36:09.114
I found the baby in the trash
can in the hotel room.

36:10.379 --> 36:12.416
It was wrapped
in a towel.

36:13.348 --> 36:16.295
There was newspaper
on top of it, to hide it.

36:17.686 --> 36:19.063
It was dead.

36:26.261 --> 36:28.400
I can't accept your terms.

36:30.032 --> 36:33.013
I'll subpoena him.
He'll testify with no preconditions.

36:33.068 --> 36:35.412
Absolutely not.
He'll take the Fifth.

36:38.473 --> 36:40.453
I'm conferring
immunity right now.

36:40.509 --> 36:42.853
You're taking the stand
tomorrow morning, Mr. Talbert.

36:42.911 --> 36:44.584
CARNEY: He won't testify.

36:46.148 --> 36:47.752
Are you sure about that,
Mr. Talbert?

36:47.816 --> 36:50.422
I am not sending
my daughter to jail.

36:50.853 --> 36:53.629
CARNEY: What are you going to do, Mr.
McCoy? Cite him for contempt?

36:53.922 --> 36:56.732
He gets 30 days in jail,
and you still get nothing.

36:56.792 --> 36:58.533
For God's sake, he's just
trying to save his daughter.

36:58.594 --> 37:01.734
No deal. Ms. Ross,
get an officer in here

37:02.364 --> 37:04.674
Mr. Talbert,
I'm having you arrested

37:04.733 --> 37:05.768
pending a contempt hearing.

37:05.834 --> 37:06.869
CARNEY: McCoy...

37:06.935 --> 37:10.576
I've had enough of him, his
daughter and her boyfriend.

37:10.906 --> 37:13.614
If I could indict him
as a co-conspirator, I would.

37:13.675 --> 37:17.248
This baby is dead.
I hope they all go to jail for it.

37:18.046 --> 37:21.653
Place this man under arrest
and get him out of my office.

37:32.461 --> 37:36.273
BRISCOE: The baby was wrapped in a
towel bearing the initials "CH."

37:36.331 --> 37:38.641
The Manager of
the Carrington Hotel

37:38.700 --> 37:40.839
confirmed that it was
in fact one of theirs.

37:44.473 --> 37:46.510
Is this the towel,
Detective?

37:48.844 --> 37:51.586
Yes. That's my signature
on the evidence bag.

37:52.247 --> 37:55.285
People's 56, Your Honor.
No more questions.

38:01.023 --> 38:03.060
Detective,

38:03.125 --> 38:06.072
do you know who disposed of the
body at the construction site?

38:06.528 --> 38:07.666
Not for a fact.

38:07.729 --> 38:11.142
Now that site's kept
locked at night, isn't it?

38:11.233 --> 38:13.440
It's surrounded
by an eight-foot

38:13.502 --> 38:15.778
chain-link fence
topped by barbed wire?

38:15.971 --> 38:17.609
Yes.
It wouldn't be easy

38:17.673 --> 38:21.052
to climb over that, carrying a
six-pound weight, would it?

38:21.977 --> 38:22.978
I guess not.

38:23.045 --> 38:25.252
Do you know
who had a key to the gate?

38:26.682 --> 38:28.093
Actually, there
were six people.

38:28.150 --> 38:29.390
Including my
client's father,

38:29.451 --> 38:30.521
isn't that right?
Objection.

38:30.585 --> 38:33.191
Why? I have the right to put forth
alternate theories of crime, Your Honor.

38:33.255 --> 38:34.393
Not without evidence
to support them.

38:34.456 --> 38:36.868
That's what I'm trying to get
at, Your Honor. Evidence.

38:36.992 --> 38:39.905
Overruled.
Answer the question, Detective.

38:41.296 --> 38:44.209
Yes, he had a key, which his
daughter could've borrowed.

38:44.266 --> 38:45.267
Your Honor...

38:45.334 --> 38:47.041
You asked the question,
Mr. Garnett.

38:47.102 --> 38:48.137
Anything else?

38:48.203 --> 38:50.183
No, Your Honor.
No more questions.

38:51.406 --> 38:54.012
Detective Briscoe,
you may step down.

38:55.844 --> 38:57.983
The People have no more
rebuttal witnesses.

38:58.046 --> 39:01.357
The defense does.
We'd like to call Mrs. Sarah Talbert.

39:02.217 --> 39:04.959
She was president of her
history club in high school.

39:05.721 --> 39:09.259
She was vice-president
of the student council,

39:09.691 --> 39:15.198
and she was the editor
of her high school yearbook,

39:16.131 --> 39:19.704
and she received the
Hardiman Prize for geometry.

39:21.403 --> 39:24.111
She has a very bright future
ahead of her.

39:27.042 --> 39:29.750
Her having an illegitimate
child, was that something

39:29.811 --> 39:31.381
you and your husband
had in mind?

39:31.446 --> 39:32.516
Objection.

39:32.714 --> 39:35.752
Sustained.
Move along, Mr. Garnett.

39:37.819 --> 39:40.993
Mrs. Talbert,
this past Sunday morning,

39:41.056 --> 39:42.592
did you and your husband
receive a visit

39:42.657 --> 39:44.864
from Mr. McCoy
and Ms. Ross?

39:47.295 --> 39:48.501
Yes.

39:48.563 --> 39:49.735
During that visit,

39:50.565 --> 39:53.569
did your husband make any
admissions concerning the death

39:53.635 --> 39:55.842
and burial of
your daughter's baby?

39:55.904 --> 39:57.906
Objection!
Approach, Your Honor.

40:01.810 --> 40:04.814
It's the People's position that Mr.
Talbert lied to protect his daughter.

40:04.980 --> 40:06.482
That's his position,
not mine

40:06.548 --> 40:09.051
Mr. Talbert's credibility
is an issue for the jury.

40:09.117 --> 40:11.358
Then the person who should be
testifying here is Mr. Talbert.

40:11.420 --> 40:14.333
Well, he isn't, because Mr.
McCoy has him in jail for contempt.

40:14.856 --> 40:16.802
He advised counsel
that if called,

40:16.858 --> 40:18.735
he would invoke his
Fifth Amendment rights.

40:18.927 --> 40:21.533
I immunized him.
He still refused to testify.

40:21.930 --> 40:23.739
He'll stay in jail
until he changes his mind.

40:23.799 --> 40:27.406
Your Honor, I don't represent Mr.
Talbert. I have no control over him.

40:27.469 --> 40:30.507
To penalize my client and Mr.
Horton for Mr. Talbert's actions

40:30.705 --> 40:32.742
amounts to
a reversible error.

40:32.808 --> 40:35.084
Your Honor, ask Mr...

40:35.143 --> 40:38.147
How long have you had
Mr. Talbert locked up?

40:39.514 --> 40:40.857
A little over 36 hours.

40:41.550 --> 40:45.692
He's not going to change his mind, Mr.
McCoy. You're overruled.

40:48.490 --> 40:50.367
The witness will answer.

40:53.428 --> 40:55.066
Mrs. Talbert?

40:57.899 --> 41:02.211
My husband said that he went
to the hotel room, and he...

41:05.040 --> 41:07.281
He found the baby
there alive.

41:09.911 --> 41:12.221
It was having
trouble breathing.

41:12.280 --> 41:13.657
GARNETT: What else?

41:18.420 --> 41:19.831
(CRYING)

41:20.622 --> 41:25.037
He said that it died before
he could get to the hospital.

41:29.397 --> 41:31.377
He decided to bury it.

41:31.967 --> 41:34.379
We've heard testimony that
your grandchild was strangled.

41:34.436 --> 41:36.347
My husband did
not kill that baby.

41:36.404 --> 41:38.577
Well, are you saying that it was
your daughter and her boyfriend?

41:38.640 --> 41:40.881
No!
Christina's not a murderer.

41:40.942 --> 41:43.752
She couldn't possibly harm
a defenseless little baby.

41:43.845 --> 41:45.347
Well, then you're saying
your daughter

41:45.413 --> 41:47.324
must've allowed
Mr. Horton to strangle

41:47.382 --> 41:48.452
her child.
No, never.

41:48.517 --> 41:50.053
Then it must've been your husband.
Objection.

41:50.118 --> 41:51.392
I didn't say that.
Sustained.

41:51.453 --> 41:53.899
You can't have it
both ways, Mrs. Talbert!

41:53.955 --> 41:55.696
Your Honor...
Your husband or your daughter!

41:55.757 --> 41:56.963
MRS. TALBERT: I don't know.
Mr. Garnett.

41:57.025 --> 41:58.527
I don't know.

41:58.827 --> 42:00.898
Mr. Garnett. Enough.

42:05.133 --> 42:06.806
No more questions.

42:19.714 --> 42:24.060
Now you've heard testimony about
Christina Talbert's father.

42:24.119 --> 42:26.258
He found the baby alive
in the hotel room.

42:26.321 --> 42:31.134
It died while in his care.
He buried it in a construction site.

42:32.194 --> 42:35.869
Now, is he lying to protect his
daughter or to protect himself?

42:35.931 --> 42:39.970
Even his own wife isn't sure,
and Mr. Talbert won't tell us

42:40.502 --> 42:44.575
because he'd rather sit in jail,
than explain himself to you.

42:47.943 --> 42:51.914
Now I want you to look
at these two children.

42:52.747 --> 42:58.322
These polite, bright,
naive children.

42:59.087 --> 43:04.093
If you think it's possible, that
in an act of panic and confusion,

43:05.060 --> 43:08.064
they killed that baby, you must
also admit that it's possible

43:08.129 --> 43:12.805
Warren Talbert killed it.
That's called reasonable doubt.

43:14.202 --> 43:17.342
That's why there's only
one right thing to do.

43:18.740 --> 43:20.310
You must acquit.

43:23.878 --> 43:26.381
As you retire to
conduct your deliberations,

43:26.448 --> 43:30.794
some of you may take with you the image of Mrs.
Talbert on the stand,

43:31.086 --> 43:34.932
unable to choose between her
husband and her daughter.

43:36.024 --> 43:39.528
Could you point
at your own daughter,

43:40.195 --> 43:42.573
and say that
she killed her baby?

43:42.631 --> 43:45.737
The fact that Mrs. Talbert
couldn't isn't evidence.

43:46.368 --> 43:48.974
It's emotional
manipulation.

43:51.473 --> 43:55.216
And that this girl
could sit there,

43:56.011 --> 43:58.355
and let it happen
to her own mother,

43:58.413 --> 44:00.791
tells you what you need
to know about her.

44:02.884 --> 44:05.797
I'd like you to take
another image with you.

44:06.721 --> 44:08.894
Picture these
naive children

44:11.293 --> 44:16.572
dancing arm in arm in a
frat house to a love song,

44:17.132 --> 44:21.672
minutes after they strangled
their baby with their bare hands

44:21.870 --> 44:25.147
and left it wrapped
in a blood-soaked towel.

44:30.478 --> 44:32.116
Think about that,

44:36.051 --> 44:37.792
then cast your vote.

44:50.398 --> 44:52.878
JUDGE BARRY: Madam Foreperson,
has the jury reached a verdict?

44:53.501 --> 44:55.481
Yes, Your Honor,
we have.

44:56.071 --> 44:58.415
Will the defendants
please rise.

45:00.709 --> 45:02.780
For the defendant
Thomas Horton,

45:02.844 --> 45:05.950
on the count of murder in the
second degree, how do you find?

45:06.247 --> 45:09.854
We find the defendant
Thomas Horton not guilty.

45:11.319 --> 45:13.856
For the defendant
Christina Talbert,

45:13.922 --> 45:16.766
on the count of murder in the
second degree, how do you find?

45:16.925 --> 45:20.270
We find the defendant
Christina Talbert not guilty.

45:21.029 --> 45:23.236
Members of the jury, I thank
you for your service.

45:23.298 --> 45:24.709
You are now dismissed.

45:24.766 --> 45:26.268
(GAVEL POUNDS)

45:34.109 --> 45:36.350
Baby's dead,
and no one's responsible.

45:36.945 --> 45:40.017
No one was responsible
when it was alive either.

45:41.282 --> 45:43.694
Warren Talbert's
still in jail.

45:44.786 --> 45:48.233
We could get him for obstruction of
justice, destruction of evidence.

45:48.323 --> 45:51.827
We got beat.
Just send him home to his family.
