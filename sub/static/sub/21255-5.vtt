00:02.833 --> 00:04.000
- VERNON: Previously
on "Still the King"--

00:04.100 --> 00:05.867
- Crop circles are known
to emit high levels of--

00:05.967 --> 00:07.067
- BOTH: --electromagnetic
radiation.

00:07.167 --> 00:08.567
- I have a group of my own.

00:08.667 --> 00:10.200
We are currently accepting
members of all genders.

00:10.300 --> 00:12.700
- You can't invite my girlfriend
to join your dumb group.

00:12.800 --> 00:14.333
- He just did.
- You watch yourself.

00:14.433 --> 00:16.133
- I'm trying to do
the right thing by you.

00:16.233 --> 00:17.533
I made this whole mess.

00:17.633 --> 00:19.767
My career, missing out
on my little girl growing up.

00:19.867 --> 00:22.700
Now, I just wanna get back
to the real me, my music.

00:22.800 --> 00:24.367
- Well, you potential fathers
need to start

00:24.467 --> 00:25.967
contributing to the household.

00:26.067 --> 00:27.067
- I got a job.

00:27.167 --> 00:28.833
- I'm king stallion
around these parts.

00:28.933 --> 00:30.700
- Well, maybe there's
a new deputy in town.

00:34.100 --> 00:39.200
- [chanting] UTI, UTI, UTI.

00:39.300 --> 00:41.433
- WALT: Hear ye, hear ye,

00:41.533 --> 00:44.167
we are here in recognition
of the undiscovered.

00:44.267 --> 00:46.200
Let no person be here

00:46.300 --> 00:48.533
unless they're here
of their own free will.

00:48.633 --> 00:53.567
Do you, Leia Fityous,
vow to seek out the unknown?

00:53.667 --> 00:54.633
- I do.

00:54.733 --> 00:58.133
- And if the unknown
becomes the known,

00:58.233 --> 00:59.467
do you vow to seek out

00:59.567 --> 01:03.067
an entirely different
and unrelated, unknown thing?

01:03.167 --> 01:04.200
- Sure.

01:04.300 --> 01:06.433
- Well then,
I hereby welcome you

01:06.533 --> 01:10.967
to the brotherhood of
the--sisterhood.

01:11.067 --> 01:12.100
- Sibling--sibling hood.

01:12.200 --> 01:13.633
- Sibling hood?

01:13.733 --> 01:15.667
Moving on.

01:15.767 --> 01:17.467
I, Walter Baines Murray,

01:17.567 --> 01:20.600
hereby welcome you
to the founding chapter

01:20.700 --> 01:22.900
of Ultra Terrestrial
Investigations,

01:23.067 --> 01:27.067
henceforth knowns as UTI--

01:27.100 --> 01:28.800
- What?

01:30.567 --> 01:33.067
- Damn it, Terry.
- Come on, man.

01:33.100 --> 01:36.133
- Cool if I eat my bologna sando
in here?

01:36.233 --> 01:38.367
- I gotta go.
I should get back to work.

01:38.467 --> 01:42.533
- *

01:46.200 --> 01:47.600
- Enjoy that sandwich.

01:47.700 --> 01:51.700
- *

01:57.500 --> 02:01.433
- [smoke detector sounds]

02:02.633 --> 02:04.767
- * Still the King *

02:07.967 --> 02:11.400
- So, Ronnie, is there anything
you wanna say to me today?

02:11.500 --> 02:16.233
- Um...you look beautiful.

02:16.333 --> 02:17.667
- Thank you.

02:17.767 --> 02:21.067
But is there anything more
today specific you wanna say?

02:21.167 --> 02:23.700
- You look beautiful today.

02:26.167 --> 02:27.200
- Whoo!

02:27.300 --> 02:29.067
It's a really special day.

02:29.133 --> 02:31.467
- Oh, thank you.

02:31.567 --> 02:35.500
- I was lying in bed last night
and had an epiphany.

02:35.600 --> 02:38.267
- Oh my God, you better
wash your sheets, Vernon.

02:38.367 --> 02:40.500
- Ever since I got
my old song book back,

02:40.600 --> 02:42.567
it's like the lights came on.

02:42.667 --> 02:45.133
I need to go somewhere
and play my music for people

02:45.233 --> 02:46.933
that care about the songs.

02:47.067 --> 02:51.067
- Is there anything about me
today that you wanna say?

02:51.167 --> 02:53.833
- You...look beautiful.

02:57.100 --> 02:58.567
- Morning.
- Morning.

02:58.667 --> 03:01.367
- Um, I am headed
off to school.

03:01.467 --> 03:02.600
I love you.

03:02.700 --> 03:04.667
- And?

03:04.767 --> 03:07.067
- I respect you as a person.

03:07.167 --> 03:08.267
Bye, Dad.

03:08.367 --> 03:10.300
- Stay out of trouble.
- You, too.

03:10.400 --> 03:11.733
Nope.

03:11.833 --> 03:13.533
- Well, anyway,
I better hit the bricks, too.

03:13.633 --> 03:15.067
Gotta strike
while the iron's hot.

03:15.100 --> 03:16.300
You know what I'm saying?

03:16.400 --> 03:18.133
- Oh yeah, my iron's
pretty hot, too, you know?

03:18.233 --> 03:20.333
Uh, probably so hot
it'd burn my shirt right off me

03:20.433 --> 03:21.667
before it even got
the wrinkles out.

03:21.767 --> 03:23.800
- It's the wrong
kind of iron, dumbass.

03:23.900 --> 03:24.967
- Oh thank you, sir.

03:25.067 --> 03:26.567
- I wasn't getting that for you.

03:29.600 --> 03:31.400
- I can't believe it.

03:31.500 --> 03:34.067
They forgot my [bleep] birthday.

03:34.133 --> 03:35.767
- *

03:35.867 --> 03:36.833
- Hey, hey.

03:36.933 --> 03:38.800
Whoo, listen up.

03:38.900 --> 03:41.333
I bet you all are wondering
why I called you here today.

03:41.433 --> 03:42.833
- To pay us
for last week's gig?

03:42.933 --> 03:44.167
- Nope.

03:44.267 --> 03:46.900
This band has been playing
like a motorcycle orchestra

03:47.067 --> 03:50.533
with a ZZ Top backbone
and Springsteen attitude.

03:50.633 --> 03:51.933
- He's right.
We've been kicking ass.

03:52.067 --> 03:54.833
- But what good is it
if the songs kick ass

03:54.933 --> 03:58.100
if the right ears
aren't there to hear 'em?

03:58.200 --> 04:01.767
So tonight
we're playing a showcase

04:01.867 --> 04:04.367
at the world-famous
Bluebird Café.

04:04.467 --> 04:06.267
- ALL: [cheering]

04:06.367 --> 04:07.500
- That's huge, Vernon.

04:07.600 --> 04:09.200
- It's like we're on
that TV show "Nashville."

04:09.300 --> 04:10.867
I'd totally be Will Lexington.

04:10.967 --> 04:11.900
Who'd you be, Mo?

04:12.067 --> 04:13.100
- Uh, let's see.

04:13.200 --> 04:15.167
I'd be someone
on one of the very few TV shows

04:15.267 --> 04:18.100
that features a black character.

04:18.200 --> 04:20.333
- Uh, hey, Vernon.
Can I talk to you for a second?

04:20.433 --> 04:21.767
- Sure.

04:23.100 --> 04:25.067
- It's nearly impossible to get
a showcase at the Bluebird Café,

04:25.167 --> 04:26.900
especially last minute.

04:27.067 --> 04:28.067
What's going on?

04:28.167 --> 04:31.600
- Son, I was a multiplatinum
recording artist.

04:31.700 --> 04:34.133
And I haven't booked it yet.

04:34.233 --> 04:35.800
Minor technicality.

04:35.900 --> 04:37.700
- Seems like
a major technicality.

04:37.800 --> 04:39.567
- Now come on, do you trust me?

04:42.100 --> 04:44.433
- Oh, I'm sorry, I thought
that was a rhetorical question.

04:44.533 --> 04:48.433
- Carry on! Eyes on Coy!

04:48.533 --> 04:54.533
- [crowd cheering]

04:54.633 --> 04:57.500
- Sales have been
a little limp this month.

04:57.600 --> 04:59.267
- [crowd groaning]

04:59.367 --> 05:01.667
- But in order
to perk things up a bit,

05:01.767 --> 05:06.300
I've decided to add a cherry
on top of your commishes.

05:06.400 --> 05:10.200
- [crowd cheering]

05:10.300 --> 05:11.333
- Gentlemen!

05:11.433 --> 05:13.100
Gentlemen! Gentlemen!

05:13.200 --> 05:16.067
I give to you...

05:16.133 --> 05:21.100
the Aquarius waterpik troph.

05:21.200 --> 05:24.467
- That is the Cadillac latte
waterpik, boys.

05:24.567 --> 05:26.667
Get your mouths ready.

05:26.767 --> 05:28.867
- All you need to do...

05:28.967 --> 05:34.067
is move the most shares
in our newest investment...

05:34.167 --> 05:36.633
Trident Marina Incorporated.

05:36.733 --> 05:40.633
- [crowd cheering]

05:48.600 --> 05:49.700
- Listen up.

05:49.800 --> 05:52.700
I don't know what a waterpik is.

05:52.800 --> 05:55.367
I don't even know
what a waterpik does.

05:55.467 --> 05:57.133
But I do know one thing.

05:57.233 --> 06:01.400
Tonight, I'm gonna be
waterpik-ing something

06:01.500 --> 06:05.800
with my brand-new waterpik.

06:05.900 --> 06:08.267
- Oh, Vance, the only thing
you'll be picking

06:08.367 --> 06:11.667
is your job off the floor
after I win that damn thing.

06:11.767 --> 06:13.500
- You better watch your mouth,
Ronnie.

06:13.600 --> 06:14.967
'Cause I am.

06:18.400 --> 06:21.733
- [indistinct chatter]

06:21.833 --> 06:24.067
- [phone ringing]
- Go for Vance.

06:24.167 --> 06:25.133
- Are you alright, man?

06:25.233 --> 06:26.700
- Get back to work!

06:26.800 --> 06:29.600
- *

06:33.567 --> 06:35.567
- Excuse me,
are you the manager?

06:35.667 --> 06:37.567
- Yeah, did you figure that out
all by yourself?

06:37.667 --> 06:39.067
- A little bit psychic.

06:39.133 --> 06:41.333
And your nametag
says manager on it.

06:41.433 --> 06:42.967
- What can I do for you, bro?

06:43.067 --> 06:45.300
- Well, uh...

06:45.400 --> 06:48.067
I'm sure you recognize who I am.

06:48.133 --> 06:49.500
Vernon Brown.

06:49.600 --> 06:51.867
- Nope.
- Burnin' Vernon.

06:51.967 --> 06:53.167
- Still no.

06:53.267 --> 06:54.867
- The Burnin' Vernon.

06:54.967 --> 06:56.933
- You know,
adding a definite article

06:57.067 --> 07:00.067
in front of your nickname's
really not helping me here.

07:00.100 --> 07:01.900
- Alright, Hoss, let me
help you out here.

07:02.067 --> 07:05.533
I had a huge monster hit
back in the early '90s.

07:05.633 --> 07:08.967
Ring any bells?

07:09.067 --> 07:10.367
- You're the guy
with the mullet.

07:10.467 --> 07:11.467
- Yeah.

07:11.567 --> 07:12.733
Now you're talking.

07:12.833 --> 07:15.067
Kentucky Waterfalls,
Missouri Compromise,

07:15.133 --> 07:16.433
Tennessee Top Hat.

07:16.533 --> 07:18.133
Anyway, I'm not here
about my hair.

07:18.233 --> 07:21.367
Uh, I got a killer new band,
killer tunes.

07:21.467 --> 07:23.633
And we wanna debut
our songs here.

07:23.733 --> 07:27.500
- Uh...sure.

07:27.600 --> 07:29.800
What you're gonna wanna do is,

07:29.900 --> 07:31.600
uh, go ahead
and call up the office.

07:31.700 --> 07:34.067
They will set you up
with an audition.

07:34.100 --> 07:36.700
And then if you do well there,
I'll book you a slot

07:36.800 --> 07:40.500
as soon as one opens up,
which basically never happens.

07:40.600 --> 07:42.500
- That's not
gonna work for me, Todd.

07:42.600 --> 07:44.433
I mean,
I already promised my band

07:44.533 --> 07:45.500
we're playing here tonight.

07:45.600 --> 07:47.100
- You promised them?

07:47.200 --> 07:48.133
Uh, what am I thinking?

07:48.233 --> 07:49.267
What am I thinking?

07:49.367 --> 07:50.733
Damn.

07:50.833 --> 07:52.233
You know what I'm thinking?

07:52.333 --> 07:53.367
That's a bummer.

07:53.467 --> 07:57.600
You'll wait your turn
like everybody else.

07:57.700 --> 07:59.400
- Care I use your restroom
before I go?

07:59.500 --> 08:00.533
- Yeah.

08:00.633 --> 08:02.267
Go ahead.

08:02.367 --> 08:03.500
- Alright.

08:03.600 --> 08:05.400
- It's the one with the nametag
bathroom on it.

08:05.500 --> 08:06.833
- Alright, thank you.

08:06.933 --> 08:10.067
- [zipper zips]
- [toilet flushes]

08:10.167 --> 08:13.267
- VERNON: [sighs]

08:13.367 --> 08:16.867
- You know, normally,
I wouldn't say this...

08:16.967 --> 08:19.833
but you need
to drop the soap, man.

08:19.933 --> 08:22.167
You know what I'm sayin'?

08:22.267 --> 08:23.433
- Not really.

08:23.533 --> 08:25.600
- [toilet flushes]

08:25.700 --> 08:27.067
- You hear that sound?

08:27.100 --> 08:30.667
That's the sound of your career
going down the toilet.

08:30.767 --> 08:33.633
Drop the soap, dumbass.

08:33.733 --> 08:35.167
Drop the soap.

08:46.267 --> 08:48.067
- Hey, Doily.
- DOILY: Hey, buddy, what's up?

08:48.133 --> 08:50.167
- Hey, man, I could use
a little help right now.

08:50.267 --> 08:51.067
You busy?

08:51.167 --> 08:52.333
You know where the Bluebird is?

08:55.300 --> 08:57.467
- *

08:57.567 --> 08:58.800
- I thought
the old man day drinkers

08:58.900 --> 09:00.067
were a pain in the ass.

09:00.100 --> 09:01.900
These new Nashville hipsters

09:02.067 --> 09:05.167
want everything small batch
and muddle.

09:05.267 --> 09:07.767
- Geesh, it takes like an hour
to make a damn drink.

09:07.867 --> 09:10.500
- [laughing]

09:10.600 --> 09:12.133
- Thanks for cheering me up.

09:12.233 --> 09:14.467
And you're the only one
who remembered my birthday.

09:16.533 --> 09:18.600
- Today is your birthday.

09:18.700 --> 09:19.967
- DEBBIE: It's fine.
- No, it's not.

09:20.067 --> 09:21.233
I'm gonna fix this right now.

09:21.333 --> 09:22.900
Excuse me, hello.

09:23.067 --> 09:26.667
It is my best friend's birthday.

09:26.767 --> 09:30.500
- I'm actually cut,
so if you could just--

09:30.600 --> 09:32.167
- *

09:32.267 --> 09:34.767
- I'm gonna need
everybody to calm down!

09:34.867 --> 09:37.167
Chief Health Inspector
Mitchell Doily!

09:37.267 --> 09:39.200
I gotta talk to the manager!
- Excuse me!

09:39.300 --> 09:41.600
- Get up, Tubby.
- Sir, I'm the manager here.

09:41.700 --> 09:42.967
Could you bring it down
a little bit?

09:43.067 --> 09:44.433
- You're the manager?
Uh, uh, uh.

09:44.533 --> 09:45.933
Okay, yeah.
I got a problem.

09:46.067 --> 09:50.067
I got a call from downtown
saying that this establishment

09:50.100 --> 09:56.167
is in flagrant violation
of Tennessee health code 3012,

09:56.267 --> 09:59.900
which states that
every food service establishment

10:00.000 --> 10:02.867
must require all employees
to wash their hands

10:02.967 --> 10:04.900
after using the bathroom.

10:05.000 --> 10:07.300
- We had a soap dispenser
get ripped off the wall.

10:07.400 --> 10:09.133
- This place is getting
shut down for two weeks

10:09.233 --> 10:10.933
while we run
a thorough investigation.

10:11.033 --> 10:12.933
- Is there maybe someone else
that I can talk to

10:13.033 --> 10:14.400
to straighten
this whole thing out?

10:14.500 --> 10:17.033
- Are you trying to bribe me?
Whoa, I just saw that.

10:17.133 --> 10:19.867
- I am in no way
trying to bribe you, sir.

10:19.967 --> 10:22.833
- Well, wait a second.

10:22.933 --> 10:25.633
Is that Burnin' Vernon Brown?

10:25.733 --> 10:29.367
"Billboard" magazine's 1993
hottest newcomer of the year?

10:30.767 --> 10:32.067
- Yeah.

10:32.167 --> 10:34.400
- I've always wanted
to see that legend play live.

10:34.500 --> 10:35.900
Tell you what we can do.

10:36.000 --> 10:38.367
If you could make
that dream come true for me,

10:38.467 --> 10:41.967
I think I could overlook
this minor infraction.

10:42.067 --> 10:44.067
- So it's a shakedown?

10:44.167 --> 10:46.400
- Maybe it is, maybe it isn't,
you know?

10:46.500 --> 10:47.533
- Fine.

10:47.633 --> 10:49.800
You know what? Fine, okay.

10:49.900 --> 10:52.133
But you two have to be
alright with the fact

10:52.233 --> 10:55.167
that you're robbing a young,
talented, deserving artist

10:55.267 --> 10:56.867
of their rightful spot
up on that stage.

10:56.967 --> 10:57.967
Are you okay with that?

10:58.067 --> 11:00.767
- Yep. I'm good with it.

11:00.867 --> 11:02.200
See ya tonight, amigo.

11:02.300 --> 11:03.833
- *

11:03.933 --> 11:04.867
- Here's your traveler's checks.

11:04.967 --> 11:06.567
Enjoy your trip.

11:09.467 --> 11:10.400
- The patches came in.

11:10.500 --> 11:11.500
- Uhhhhh!

11:11.600 --> 11:14.067
Thank you.
Uh, it's so cool.

11:14.167 --> 11:16.167
I don't have much real estate
left on my jean jacket,

11:16.267 --> 11:17.933
but you don't actually
wear these, do you?

11:18.067 --> 11:20.167
- Sometimes.
Uh, it's fine.

11:20.267 --> 11:22.067
Listen, if you don't have plans
tonight, we're gonna play

11:22.100 --> 11:23.733
the Bluebird Café
at like 7 o'clock.

11:23.833 --> 11:25.500
- Oh, dang.

11:25.600 --> 11:26.567
Reggie's taking me on a date.

11:26.667 --> 11:28.167
We're going to Shrimps and Such.

11:28.267 --> 11:29.700
- Alright, well, that's cool.

11:29.800 --> 11:30.867
Next time.

11:30.967 --> 11:33.200
I'll see ya at the meeting.
- Yeah.

11:33.300 --> 11:35.067
I promise,
I'll come to your next gig.

11:35.167 --> 11:36.867
- Alright, cool.
- LEIA: Yeah, I promise.

11:36.967 --> 11:38.400
- Alright, see ya later.
- LEIA: Okay.

11:40.433 --> 11:42.667
- On your marks!

11:42.767 --> 11:45.733
Get set!

11:45.833 --> 11:48.433
Go!
- [cowbell ringing]

11:48.533 --> 11:53.233
- *

11:53.333 --> 11:54.600
- Sale!

11:54.700 --> 11:58.300
- *

11:58.400 --> 12:01.167
- Okay, Ronnie!

12:01.267 --> 12:02.533
- Go, go!

12:02.633 --> 12:03.967
- [banging]

12:04.067 --> 12:05.600
- Remember the prize!

12:05.700 --> 12:07.867
Keep the prize in your mind!

12:07.967 --> 12:12.067
- [indistinct yelling]

12:12.100 --> 12:13.267
- Br-r-r-r-r-r-r.

12:13.367 --> 12:15.600
- I'm coming for you! Ha-ha!

12:15.700 --> 12:17.433
- Little piece of [bleep].

12:17.533 --> 12:19.767
- Ronnie, oh, yeah, yeah.

12:19.867 --> 12:22.133
- Beat down, baby!

12:22.233 --> 12:26.533
- [indistinct cheering]

12:26.633 --> 12:28.100
- *

12:28.200 --> 12:30.700
- Yeah? Yeah? For me?

12:30.800 --> 12:32.800
[laughing]

12:32.900 --> 12:35.600
- *

12:35.700 --> 12:37.533
- It's over! It's over!

12:40.067 --> 12:41.100
- [siren wails]

12:43.167 --> 12:44.267
- Evening.

12:44.367 --> 12:45.733
- Hey.
- Hi, there.

12:45.833 --> 12:47.067
License and registration, ma'am.

12:47.133 --> 12:48.600
You were speeding.

12:48.700 --> 12:49.533
- Was I?

12:49.633 --> 12:52.700
- Uh, yes, ma'am.
A 37 in a 35.

12:52.800 --> 12:55.100
- [police radio chatter]

12:55.200 --> 12:56.833
- Wait a second.

12:56.933 --> 12:58.067
Is today your birthday?

12:58.133 --> 13:00.500
- Yeah, it is.

13:00.600 --> 13:02.967
- Well, happy birthday to you.

13:03.067 --> 13:04.200
- Thank you.

13:04.300 --> 13:06.267
Nobody today
remembered my birthday.

13:06.367 --> 13:07.667
- I'll tell you what.
I'm gonna let

13:07.767 --> 13:09.233
that little
speeding infraction pass,

13:09.333 --> 13:10.867
no problem.
- Ah, thank you so much.

13:10.967 --> 13:14.500
- Unfortunately, your license
does expire on your birthday.

13:14.600 --> 13:16.667
So I will have to write you
a ticket for that.

13:16.767 --> 13:19.833
But just hang tight,
and I'll be right back, okay?

13:19.933 --> 13:23.700
- *

13:26.433 --> 13:30.333
- It was a hard, hard,
gruelingly hard race.

13:30.433 --> 13:33.367
But as you usual...

13:33.467 --> 13:37.867
the cream has risen to the...

13:37.967 --> 13:38.900
top.

13:39.067 --> 13:41.400
The winner is...

13:41.500 --> 13:42.933
Ronnie!

13:43.067 --> 13:47.500
- ALL: [cheering]

13:54.167 --> 13:57.933
- Now most people know today,
April 3rd, is the anniversary

13:58.067 --> 14:00.633
of the founding
of the Pony Express.

14:00.733 --> 14:05.500
But here at Integrity First,
it will henceforth be known

14:05.600 --> 14:08.967
as the day that young Ronnie
broke all of our sales records

14:09.067 --> 14:10.600
and cemented his place

14:10.700 --> 14:14.800
into the "anals"
of Integrity First history.

14:14.900 --> 14:19.100
- ALL: [cheering]

14:19.200 --> 14:20.700
- There we go.

14:20.800 --> 14:22.300
Whoo-hoo!

14:22.400 --> 14:24.567
- ALL: [cheering]

14:24.667 --> 14:29.600
- To the victor
goes the spoils.

14:29.700 --> 14:33.733
- ALL: [cheering]

14:39.200 --> 14:41.167
- You all right, Ronnie?

14:41.267 --> 14:43.300
You seem a million miles away.

14:43.400 --> 14:46.067
- The anniversary of the
founding of the Pony Express?

14:46.100 --> 14:47.700
That means it's April 3rd.

14:47.800 --> 14:50.467
If it's April 3rd,
that means it's Deb's birthday.

14:50.567 --> 14:54.933
I gotta go, Coy, I'm sorry.

14:55.067 --> 14:59.367
- Run to her, Ronferd! Run!

14:59.467 --> 15:03.433
- [indistinct chatter]

15:07.067 --> 15:08.800
- [phone dings]

15:12.900 --> 15:14.567
- VERNON: Are you guys
ready for this, man?

15:14.667 --> 15:16.367
- Oh yeah.
- VERNON: Those freaking people

15:16.467 --> 15:19.333
out there,
you know what I'm saying?

15:19.433 --> 15:21.333
Good to be with you all
this evening.

15:21.433 --> 15:23.900
I wanna thank all of you
for coming out here,

15:24.067 --> 15:26.800
especially all you folks
from the music business.

15:26.900 --> 15:29.333
- MAN: Ladies, look at the vest
and tell me,

15:29.433 --> 15:31.367
does he look like a turd
or a jerk?

15:31.467 --> 15:34.067
- It's a real special song
that I wrote

15:34.133 --> 15:35.667
about a real special young lady.

15:35.767 --> 15:38.133
I'd like to dedicate it
to her tonight.

15:38.233 --> 15:41.600
- *

15:49.900 --> 15:51.333
* You good?

15:51.433 --> 15:54.300
- MAN: [indistinct chatter]

15:54.400 --> 15:57.133
- * Do you ever sit alone

15:57.233 --> 16:00.433
*

16:00.533 --> 16:03.433
* Staring at your phone?

16:03.533 --> 16:06.367
- MAN: [indistinct chatter]

16:06.467 --> 16:09.600
- * A bit misunderstood

16:09.700 --> 16:11.367
- MAN: He's actually kinda
crazy, right?

16:11.467 --> 16:13.367
Come on, give it up, give it up.

16:13.467 --> 16:14.733
- * Are you good?

16:14.833 --> 16:18.600
- MAN: Spiked hair, the vest.
Cast of "Footloose"?

16:18.700 --> 16:22.500
What are you thinking?
- * Is the question that I ask

16:22.600 --> 16:24.967
- MAN: And he walked away.
Guy, come on, man.

16:25.067 --> 16:27.300
I've got a card and an open tab,
the ladies want drinks.

16:27.400 --> 16:29.567
What can I get you ladies?
Oh, really?

16:29.667 --> 16:31.833
- Hey! Hold up, guys, hold up.

16:31.933 --> 16:33.867
Hey, dude,
what's wrong with you, man?

16:33.967 --> 16:35.067
- Huh?

16:35.133 --> 16:37.100
- I'm up here trying
to sing a song I wrote.

16:37.200 --> 16:38.900
You're supposed to be
from the music business, man.

16:39.067 --> 16:40.667
Don't you wanna hear
the words of the song?

16:40.767 --> 16:44.267
- I listened to your songs
back in the '90s.

16:44.367 --> 16:47.333
Eh, I think we're good.

16:47.433 --> 16:49.433
- You reckon maybe you're just
a little pissed off

16:49.533 --> 16:51.067
because your lady's
screwing the pool man?

16:51.133 --> 16:53.400
- [crowd oohs]

16:53.500 --> 16:56.100
- MAN: Oh, oh.
Speaking of getting screwed,

16:56.200 --> 16:59.167
how much money did you
have to pay back to the label

16:59.267 --> 17:01.467
once they dumped you
from your deal?

17:01.567 --> 17:04.133
Oh, I said it.
- [crowd oohs]

17:04.233 --> 17:08.767
- See, it looks to me like
you're the one getting screwed.

17:08.867 --> 17:11.200
- I don't reckon you'd have
guts enough to say it

17:11.300 --> 17:12.600
to my face, would you?

17:12.700 --> 17:13.900
- I'm looking at you right now.

17:14.067 --> 17:15.667
I'm currently saying it
to your face.

17:15.767 --> 17:18.300
- I mean, uh,
closer to my face.

17:18.400 --> 17:20.067
- Uh, I get it.

17:20.100 --> 17:21.700
Old man, bad ears.

17:21.800 --> 17:23.600
Sure, let me help you out, pops.

17:23.700 --> 17:26.200
See, what I'm saying is--

17:26.300 --> 17:28.200
- [crash]

17:28.300 --> 17:32.400
- *

17:35.467 --> 17:39.067
- DOILY: Man.
- Yeah.

17:39.100 --> 17:40.967
- Well, a DUI would be
the perfect capper

17:41.067 --> 17:44.200
to this evening,
I think I'll drive.

17:44.300 --> 17:45.667
- You go ahead and go, darling.

17:45.767 --> 17:46.933
I'm gonna sit here and do

17:47.067 --> 17:48.467
a little thinking and drinking
with Doily.

17:48.567 --> 17:49.667
- Don't do too much thinking.

17:49.767 --> 17:51.600
That guy had it coming.

17:51.700 --> 17:53.533
But, hey, I really did
love the song.

17:53.633 --> 17:55.400
Well, at least the part
that I heard.

17:55.500 --> 17:56.567
See you when you get home.

17:56.667 --> 17:58.333
- You be safe, darling.

17:58.433 --> 18:01.767
- Hunk of Burnin' Vernon Brown.

18:01.867 --> 18:03.067
- The one and only.

18:03.100 --> 18:04.967
- Mm-hmm.

18:05.067 --> 18:06.700
I'm Courtney Hitch,
I'm a producer.

18:06.800 --> 18:08.233
And I would love
to work with you.

18:08.333 --> 18:10.500
- Wait, you barely even
got to hear my music.

18:10.600 --> 18:12.100
- Uh, I didn't.
But you know what?

18:12.200 --> 18:13.900
I'm not really looking
for a musician, Vernon.

18:14.067 --> 18:15.333
Come on, it's Nashville, I mean,

18:15.433 --> 18:17.233
even that busboy over there
probably has a great demo.

18:17.333 --> 18:20.067
No, no, no, no.
I'm looking for an entertainer.

18:20.133 --> 18:23.467
And you, my friend,
are a consummate entertainer.

18:23.567 --> 18:24.533
- The best.

18:24.633 --> 18:26.333
- Mm-hmm.
- The best.

18:26.433 --> 18:27.533
- Look, to those other guys,

18:27.633 --> 18:30.133
you're a washed up has-been,
a joke.

18:30.233 --> 18:31.600
But they're idiots.

18:31.700 --> 18:33.567
I mean, the old way
of selling music is dead.

18:33.667 --> 18:35.533
And they're just treading water
until they drown.

18:35.633 --> 18:37.567
Check this out.

18:37.667 --> 18:40.067
- [crash]

18:40.100 --> 18:42.600
- I recorded this
earlier tonight

18:42.700 --> 18:44.800
when you bust that record exec
over the head.

18:44.900 --> 18:48.467
Now this already has
half a million hits.

18:48.567 --> 18:50.533
Now that's real money.

18:50.633 --> 18:53.067
- Phew.
My days on top of the charts

18:53.100 --> 18:54.900
came and went a long time ago,
Hoss.

18:55.067 --> 18:57.433
- Yeah, but that was on top
of the country charts.

18:57.533 --> 18:58.633
I'm not trying to make you

18:58.733 --> 19:00.067
the biggest star
in country music.

19:00.133 --> 19:02.167
I'm trying to make you
the biggest star in the world.

19:03.900 --> 19:05.633
It's a brave new world
out there,

19:05.733 --> 19:07.667
and I just wanna make you
a part of it.

19:09.067 --> 19:10.267
Oh.

19:11.900 --> 19:14.300
Next drink's on me.

19:14.400 --> 19:16.133
Enjoy, gentlemen.

19:16.233 --> 19:17.533
- Hey, potato chip.

19:17.633 --> 19:18.733
Thirty second rule.

19:18.833 --> 19:20.900
- VERNON: I'll take it.

19:21.067 --> 19:23.267
- Too late.
- VERNON: [laughs]

19:23.367 --> 19:24.933
- Seriously?

19:25.067 --> 19:26.967
Is that like a violation
or anything?

19:27.067 --> 19:30.333
- Relax, I'm a
health inspector.

19:30.433 --> 19:32.300
- Do you know that one?
Columba?

19:32.400 --> 19:33.333
It's my favorite.

19:33.433 --> 19:34.933
- Latin for dove.

19:35.067 --> 19:36.367
Is that like your favorite bird
or something?

19:36.467 --> 19:40.167
- No, my dad and I used to watch
"Colombo" when I was a kid.

19:40.267 --> 19:42.233
I thought the constellation
was named after him.

19:42.333 --> 19:43.867
- Colombo was probably
the smartest TV detective

19:43.967 --> 19:46.067
of all time.
- Yeah.

19:48.567 --> 19:50.600
- Colombo's my jam, too.

19:50.700 --> 19:52.600
Nobody saw him coming.

19:52.700 --> 19:55.433
He's just so unassuming.

19:55.533 --> 19:57.700
- [sighs]

19:57.800 --> 19:59.100
Anyway, thanks for coming.

19:59.200 --> 20:02.500
Hope it doesn't make things
weird between you and Reggie.

20:02.600 --> 20:05.967
- Let's not worry
about Reggie tonight.

20:06.067 --> 20:09.433
It's so cool you have a hookup
here at the planetarium.

20:09.533 --> 20:11.867
- It pays to know astronomers.

20:11.967 --> 20:13.700
- You know what else would be
cool?

20:13.800 --> 20:15.633
You take this chatter outside.

20:15.733 --> 20:18.467
I'm trying to enjoy the view.

20:18.567 --> 20:20.700
- [inaudible whisper]

20:27.700 --> 20:29.000

20:52.833 --> 20:54.733
- [inaudible whisper]

20:54.833 --> 20:56.433

21:03.733 --> 21:05.500
- Wow, it's the designer series.

21:05.600 --> 21:07.867
- Only the best for you, babe.

21:07.967 --> 21:09.700
- You know, this morning
I felt like Molly Ringwald

21:09.800 --> 21:12.067
at the beginning
of "Sixteen Candles."

21:12.133 --> 21:13.633
But now I feel like
Molly Ringwald

21:13.733 --> 21:15.633
at the end of "Sixteen Candles."

21:15.733 --> 21:18.333
- Good, I'm happy.

21:18.433 --> 21:19.733
Happy birthday, Deb.

21:19.833 --> 21:21.467
Make a wish.

21:21.567 --> 21:22.900
- I don't need to.

21:23.067 --> 21:24.433
It already came true.

21:26.900 --> 21:27.800
Ronnie, you're on fire.

21:27.900 --> 21:28.800
- Huh?
- Ronnie!

21:28.900 --> 21:30.633
- Uh, uh, uh, uh.

21:30.733 --> 21:31.733
Deb, get it out.

21:31.833 --> 21:33.833
Ah, ah, ah, ah!

21:38.200 --> 21:41.367
- I found some flan.
- KAITLYN: Mm, flan.

21:41.467 --> 21:44.067
* Happy birthday to you

21:48.067 --> 21:50.867
