WEBVTT

00:00.210 --> 00:05.000
Let's do this

00:05.000 --> 00:07.520
I love you, Las Vegas.

00:07.620 --> 00:10.870
Remember, it's OK to take the shampoo but not the robes,

00:10.920 --> 00:16.430
although they can be purchased in the hotel lobby for $79.95.

00:17.760 --> 00:19.070
I can not believe the hotel makes me

00:19.070 --> 00:20.540
say that. It's so embarrassing.

00:20.550 --> 00:22.590
Yeah, and it's a downer way to end the concert.

00:22.610 --> 00:23.990
It's like Mick Jagger saying:

00:24.120 --> 00:25.360
"Good night everybody,

00:25.370 --> 00:28.870
don't forget to pick the hairs out of your shower dryings.

00:28.870 --> 00:30.580
Rock 'n Roll"

00:34.550 --> 00:36.920
Yo cowboy, turn that wagon train around,

00:36.920 --> 00:37.660
the room is over here...

00:38.300 --> 00:39.810
No it's not. It's over here.

00:40.190 --> 00:41.820
Every night, same old thing...

00:45.140 --> 00:46.260
I hate when he's right.

00:46.280 --> 00:48.200
And he's gonna steal our pillow chocolates again.

00:48.230 --> 00:49.560
Gosh!

00:52.000 --> 00:52.910
Traci?

00:53.380 --> 00:56.820
Hannah! What a wonderful surprise...

00:56.850 --> 00:58.940
and Lola...

00:59.920 --> 01:03.170
Hannah! What a wonderful surprise.

01:03.230 --> 01:04.239
What are you doing here?

01:04.300 --> 01:07.450
Let me guess, auditioning for Cirque du So lame?

01:08.310 --> 01:09.600
Stop it!

01:10.300 --> 01:12.160
Funny, but stop it.

01:13.000 --> 01:14.760
So why didn't you tell me you're gonna be in Vegas?

01:14.790 --> 01:17.410
I didn't tell anybody. I can't. It's a secret.

01:17.470 --> 01:20.010
If you are a friend you'll respect that, OK?

01:20.650 --> 01:21.470
OK, bye.

01:21.470 --> 01:24.690
Fine, if you're gonna keep hounding me about it I'll tell you.

01:25.020 --> 01:26.600
I'm getting married tomorrow!

01:27.030 --> 01:27.700
What?

01:27.700 --> 01:29.740
And more specifically to what?

01:30.810 --> 01:35.080
At least somebody loves me you bitter anime character.

01:35.170 --> 01:37.550
Whoa whoa whoa. Marry? This is crazy!

01:37.590 --> 01:39.550
What idiot talked you into this?

01:39.570 --> 01:40.990
He's not an idiot.

01:41.720 --> 01:45.780
He's my fiancee. Jakey!

01:48.630 --> 01:50.690
Somethin' somethin' somethin' say what?

01:51.880 --> 01:53.490
Somethin' somethin' somethin'?

01:54.430 --> 01:56.430
What? It's the best I can do, I'm in shock here.

01:58.000 --> 02:04.074

02:06.230 --> 02:09.080
You get the limo out front.

02:10.389 --> 02:13.940
Hottest styles, every shoe, every color.

02:14.080 --> 02:17.310
Yea when your famous it can be kinda fun.

02:17.650 --> 02:21.980
It's really you but no one ever discovers.

02:22.400 --> 02:25.800
Who would've thought that a girl like me

02:25.970 --> 02:31.370
Would double as a superstar?

02:32.060 --> 02:36.060
You get the best of both worlds.

02:36.190 --> 02:38.100
Chill it out, take it slow,

02:38.110 --> 02:39.890
then you rock out the show.

02:40.120 --> 02:43.850
You get the best of both worlds.

02:44.110 --> 02:46.830
Mix it all together and you know that

02:46.830 --> 02:49.530
It's the best of both worlds.

02:50.060 --> 02:54.680
Hannah Montana S03E16 
Jake... Another Little Piece Of My Heart

02:55.240 --> 02:57.490
Oops - argh, wrong floor!

02:57.660 --> 02:59.590
Not so fast, lover-boy!

03:06.170 --> 03:09.530
B.T.W, hate the outfit.

03:10.580 --> 03:13.770
B.T.W, I can change the outfit.

03:13.770 --> 03:16.980
You're stuck with the voice ... FOREVER!

03:17.870 --> 03:20.310
It's a nasal condition!

03:21.660 --> 03:24.420
Now Miley, before you get upset, I just want to say...

03:24.420 --> 03:26.500
Me? Upset? No!

03:27.270 --> 03:29.080
I'm just so happy to see you...

03:29.320 --> 03:32.630
making the worst decisions of your life!

03:34.670 --> 03:36.740
-Hello.  -Oh.

03:36.800 --> 03:40.980
Oh my. What's this? A proposal?

03:41.520 --> 03:44.320
A propasal? To her? Are you kidding me!

03:44.340 --> 03:46.320
Yeah, I mean, we're just teenagers.

03:46.330 --> 03:48.870
You know, barely more than childen -- practically babies.

03:48.880 --> 03:51.240
Gettin' married would be about the dumbest thing we could do,

03:51.240 --> 03:52.330
right, Jake?

03:52.650 --> 03:55.140
Well, I don't know if I'd call it dumb.

03:55.160 --> 03:56.600
Oh really, what would you call it?

03:56.680 --> 03:59.140
Stupid, idiotic, irresponsible?

03:59.160 --> 04:00.640
Yeah, I'd go with all those.

04:01.180 --> 04:03.590
Oh good. The lobby!

04:03.820 --> 04:05.570
No, no -- it's the nineteenth floor!

04:05.720 --> 04:09.030
Close enough. I'll take my chances with the stairs.

04:11.380 --> 04:15.950
Look, I know it's sudden, but I love Traci!

04:16.260 --> 04:17.899
And I want to be with her forever!

04:18.019 --> 04:19.260
Jake, you barely know her!

04:19.360 --> 04:20.440
You barely know yourself.

04:20.440 --> 04:22.290
We're talking about a lifetime commitment!

04:22.300 --> 04:25.110
You change your phone plans every six weeks!

04:25.380 --> 04:28.000
That's 'cause a new one comes along that I like better.

04:28.070 --> 04:30.080
Then why be stuck with the same

04:30.080 --> 04:32.090
phone plan for the rest of your life!

04:32.110 --> 04:34.610
If you and Traci really love each other

04:35.430 --> 04:37.770
you guys'll still feel that way in a couple of years.

04:38.380 --> 04:42.390
Han, Han, Han, Han!

04:42.420 --> 04:44.170
She just saw your concert.

04:45.020 --> 04:46.740
Would you please sign her programme?

04:46.830 --> 04:48.360
Sure. What's your name, babe?

04:48.670 --> 04:50.710
Ti... Ti... Ti... Ti...

04:50.780 --> 04:51.860
It's Tiffany.

04:51.860 --> 04:52.370
OK.

04:52.670 --> 04:54.060
Dear Tiffany.

04:55.150 --> 04:58.060
Never make the mistake of marrying too young.

05:00.000 --> 05:03.040
Surveys show that teen marriages are

05:03.040 --> 05:06.390
more likely to end in the tragedy of divorce!

05:06.420 --> 05:09.460
Never let one impulsive decision haunt you

05:09.460 --> 05:11.120
until the day you die!

05:11.480 --> 05:13.790
Love always, Hannah.

05:14.000 --> 05:15.300
Here you go, sweetie.

05:18.500 --> 05:20.990
-All I wanted was "rock on."  -Shhh.

05:21.660 --> 05:23.230
Hey! How about that.

05:23.300 --> 05:26.130
Neither one of us want advice from you. I'm outta here.

05:26.490 --> 05:27.510
No you're not!

05:28.190 --> 05:31.660
Hey! Everybody! It's Hannah Montana!

05:33.000 --> 05:34.820
Hey everybody! There's Jake Ryan!

05:35.170 --> 05:37.300
Why do I have to be more famous!

05:42.290 --> 05:45.280
So Allison what made you decide to give me a second chance?

05:45.360 --> 05:47.480
Was it my sense of humor? My charm?

05:47.700 --> 05:49.190
My constant begging?

05:50.390 --> 05:52.400
Wait a minute. We went out before?

05:53.800 --> 05:54.890
No.

06:00.170 --> 06:01.510
Heyo!

06:02.790 --> 06:05.980
Jackson. What are you doing on the floor?

06:06.020 --> 06:07.730
There's a lovely young lady here.

06:07.830 --> 06:11.140
I'm guessing you're either lost or on some sort of pity date.

06:12.150 --> 06:13.330
Who is he?

06:13.410 --> 06:15.360
Oh, I'm sorry. I'm being rude argh...

06:15.410 --> 06:17.410
Allison I'd like you to meet Rico.

06:17.460 --> 06:19.720
Rico... I'd like you to meet the door.

06:20.860 --> 06:22.050
Whoa whoa whoa!

06:22.230 --> 06:24.660
Remember when I said I was opening Camp Rico?

06:24.690 --> 06:26.820
And you said that if the brats ever got bored

06:26.820 --> 06:27.960
I could bring them here?

06:28.020 --> 06:29.250
I never said that.

06:29.420 --> 06:32.540
Well it's your word against mine. Come on in kids!

06:36.310 --> 06:37.910
Meet Uncle Jackson.

06:38.050 --> 06:41.410
Master of Magic and balloon animals!

06:42.460 --> 06:44.270
No no no! There is no way.

06:44.270 --> 06:47.560
Save your breath. Kid No.3 wants an octopus!

06:47.570 --> 06:49.350
-Me first!  -No me first!

06:49.350 --> 06:51.030
No no me first!

06:51.030 --> 06:53.190
Sorry kids but these lips got other plans.

06:53.190 --> 06:56.160
-Ewgh!  -Yeah.

06:56.870 --> 06:59.900
Fine. I guess we'll go back to the beach.

07:01.340 --> 07:03.550
But it's raining!

07:05.380 --> 07:07.850
Be brave little one. Be brave.

07:08.730 --> 07:11.620
Come on, Jackson. I don't mind I love kids.

07:11.620 --> 07:12.500
Just let them stay.

07:12.710 --> 07:18.200
Let 'em stay! Let 'em stay! Let 'em stay! Let 'em stay!

07:18.260 --> 07:20.610
OK! Fine! You can stay.

07:21.480 --> 07:23.020
I love kids too!

07:27.870 --> 07:29.430
Dude you totally planned this!

07:29.480 --> 07:32.390
Please. I can't control the weather.

07:35.540 --> 07:39.060
Or can I? Wahahaha!

07:45.180 --> 07:48.930
Hi, Jakey, it's me Traci.

07:49.880 --> 07:51.730
-Miley, what are you doing?  -Sshh!

07:52.130 --> 07:53.790
Hi Trace, what's up?

07:54.180 --> 07:58.310
Um I've been thinking about it and we are too young,

07:58.320 --> 08:00.200
so I won't be marrying you tomorrow.

08:00.430 --> 08:04.170
Oh... and if you see me anywhere in the hotel,

08:04.170 --> 08:05.410
don't talk to me...

08:05.500 --> 08:08.240
I hate you.

08:09.190 --> 08:11.590
Alright if that's the way you feel,

08:12.410 --> 08:13.600
bye Miley.

08:13.660 --> 08:14.670
Bye Jake!

08:17.010 --> 08:19.820
Dang it! How did he know it was me?

08:20.410 --> 08:23.710
Well he's either A, telepathic, B, a witch,

08:23.720 --> 08:25.620
or C, caller ID!

08:26.500 --> 08:28.340
I'll go with witch it makes me look less stupid.

08:28.800 --> 08:30.430
No, not really.

08:32.000 --> 08:35.720
OK, I left messages for both Jake and Traci's phones.

08:35.980 --> 08:37.740
Now don't worry, once they call me back

08:37.740 --> 08:39.210
I'm going to straighten out this whole mess.

08:39.240 --> 08:40.360
It's all gonna be fine.

08:40.370 --> 08:41.559
Then why are you sweating more than

08:41.559 --> 08:44.059
Uncle Earl on back-waxing Wednesday, yaow!

08:44.450 --> 08:46.780
Oh, come on, Miley. It's not that... Oh, it just hit me.

08:48.240 --> 08:49.820
I'm sorry, honey, I just can't help it.

08:49.960 --> 08:52.390
I mean, what if it was you making a mistake like this?

08:52.720 --> 08:54.720
Sacrificing your independence,

08:54.770 --> 08:57.800
tying yourself down before you've even had a chance

08:57.800 --> 08:59.620
to explore the rest of the world...

08:59.930 --> 09:01.450
throwing away the rest of your life

09:01.450 --> 09:02.980
before you've even started living it!

09:03.060 --> 09:04.660
Why would you do this to me?

09:04.800 --> 09:06.860
Why would you? Darling why!

09:07.180 --> 09:08.030
Don't worry Daddy.

09:08.030 --> 09:10.500
I'm not getting married until I'm at least twenty-five.

09:12.190 --> 09:12.970
Thirty.

09:14.220 --> 09:15.080
Forty... eighty!

09:15.080 --> 09:18.290
Dad, I want to walk down the aisle, not be wheeled down it.

09:18.580 --> 09:19.610
I'm sorry, honey.

09:20.230 --> 09:22.190
I just want you to make good choices.

09:22.450 --> 09:25.380
Oh, OK, and right now I choose to breathe through my mouth

09:25.400 --> 09:28.150
until you get your stinky pits out of my smell zone!

09:28.560 --> 09:30.190
Is that your loving way of telling me

09:30.190 --> 09:31.330
I need to go take a shower?

09:31.400 --> 09:32.180
Yes please.

09:32.180 --> 09:35.110
And feel free to use the whole little bar of hotel soap.

09:35.440 --> 09:36.380
Okey dokey.

09:39.450 --> 09:42.880
Whoa. I haven't held my breath that long since birth.

09:47.210 --> 09:48.770
Traci?

09:49.460 --> 09:52.140
Well Hannah, I just talked to Jake,

09:52.250 --> 09:53.200
and thanks to you,

09:53.200 --> 09:56.620
I will not be wearing this fabulous wedding dress tomorrow.

09:56.620 --> 09:57.640
Oh really?

09:57.690 --> 09:59.830
I mean... really?

10:00.050 --> 10:02.750
Yes. Cause we're getting married tonight!

10:02.770 --> 10:04.160
-What!  -What!

10:05.240 --> 10:07.460
That's right! In a matter of minutes

10:07.460 --> 10:11.130
I am going to be Mrs. Jake Ryan!

10:12.110 --> 10:14.190
Chao.

10:15.000 --> 10:17.140
I'm sorry Traci, I can't let you do this!

10:19.500 --> 10:20.630
Help me!

10:22.730 --> 10:23.820
Grab it!

10:27.810 --> 10:28.630
Traci!

10:28.640 --> 10:30.850
Jakey! Helpie! Grab me!

10:37.580 --> 10:39.470
What is she? Part of sled dog?

10:45.790 --> 10:48.560
I broke a nail. Now it's personal!

11:01.450 --> 11:03.050
We're still expecting a gift.

11:03.110 --> 11:04.730
Something returnable please!

11:07.270 --> 11:09.200
Well ... I guess that's it.

11:09.240 --> 11:11.770
No. I am not going to let him do this.

11:13.260 --> 11:15.500
Dad... he's the only one that can stop it.

11:17.320 --> 11:18.950
-Woops!  -I know!

11:24.340 --> 11:27.660
Where's your keys? In there! Smooth move!

11:28.570 --> 11:31.210
Dad!! Dad!!

11:31.240 --> 11:34.770
Hotel shampoo smells real good, do dah, do dah!

11:34.800 --> 11:38.350
Just the hand of sandalwood, all the do dah day!

11:39.660 --> 11:41.080
Dad!

11:43.760 --> 11:46.690
Great. He's going to lather, rinse and repeat.

11:46.950 --> 11:48.880
Dang that hair-loving hillbilly.

11:56.720 --> 11:57.800
Come on come on!

11:58.060 --> 11:59.430
No time. Stairs!

12:00.880 --> 12:02.390
Lola!

12:07.790 --> 12:08.720
And now,

12:08.720 --> 12:12.580
with the power invested in me by the State of Nevada.

12:12.600 --> 12:15.130
Stop the wedding! They're too young.

12:16.310 --> 12:18.060
My bad. Opsies.

12:18.470 --> 12:22.410
Don't make eye contact. That's the wacko from the elevator.

12:22.430 --> 12:24.320
Oh, so sorry to barge in...

12:24.330 --> 12:26.730
but you know it really is a great story to tell the kids.

12:26.730 --> 12:27.440
No pressure or anything.

12:27.440 --> 12:28.860
Plus they like a good story too.

12:29.480 --> 12:30.590
Wacko.

12:31.380 --> 12:33.400
Hey! Congratulations.

12:33.450 --> 12:36.700
Eighty is the new seventy-five!

12:38.230 --> 12:41.180
Wait a minute. You're Hannah Montana!

12:41.210 --> 12:43.580
Argh! Do my nieces love yoose!

12:43.630 --> 12:44.590
Yeah great thanks.

12:44.640 --> 12:47.160
Um... do you know anything about a "Jake Ryan" wedding?

12:47.160 --> 12:48.720
Well I know I'm uniting a happy couple

12:48.720 --> 12:50.510
in five minutes for $ 49.95.

12:50.570 --> 12:52.280
They were too cheap to spend the extra

12:52.280 --> 12:55.310
five dollars on the Al Blaine arrow of love!

12:58.230 --> 13:01.070
Marie! We're going to need another dove.

13:03.170 --> 13:05.750
The other Vegas cupids... you know they don't got these!

13:07.100 --> 13:08.390
There's more of them?

13:08.390 --> 13:11.010
Well I know where I'll be coming for my wedding!

13:11.370 --> 13:12.960
So, where is the happy couple?

13:13.050 --> 13:14.120
They're right through that door.

13:14.130 --> 13:16.560
Which is why yoose is going through that door.

13:16.610 --> 13:17.560
Oh sir you don't understand --

13:17.600 --> 13:20.550
Sorry, no, no, no. Specific instructions from the bride.

13:20.710 --> 13:22.440
Who by the way has a voice that goes through you like

13:22.440 --> 13:24.520
my Aunt Rose's day old through the casserole.

13:25.250 --> 13:26.950
Now, if you'll excuse me,

13:26.960 --> 13:28.530
Cupid needs to use the little Angel's room.

13:29.170 --> 13:31.300
You said your nieces are fans, right?

13:31.420 --> 13:33.990
Fans! Oh, forget about it.

13:34.500 --> 13:37.010
Lola. Go bang on the door until you get my Dad.

13:37.020 --> 13:37.920
I'll stall the wedding.

13:37.930 --> 13:38.890
-OK.  -go!

13:39.810 --> 13:42.570
So, cupe. Baby.

13:43.610 --> 13:45.010
How would your nieces like to

13:45.010 --> 13:46.790
see the concert from the front row?

13:47.070 --> 13:48.850
-Oh!  -Oh!

13:55.900 --> 13:58.670
Go ahead. Pull it if you want.

13:58.870 --> 14:01.440
We Latin's have roots of steel!

14:01.870 --> 14:04.280
What a cutie you are!

14:04.420 --> 14:07.020
I know. And I'm rich too!

14:07.870 --> 14:09.880
It's almost not fair.

14:11.610 --> 14:14.340
I'm so glad we let them stay, Jackson!

14:14.350 --> 14:15.800
Isn't this fun!

14:18.550 --> 14:20.000
I'm sorry did you say something?

14:20.360 --> 14:23.360
I can't hear anything over the blood pounding in my ears!

14:24.100 --> 14:25.500
Here you go, kid.

14:26.580 --> 14:28.170
But I wanted a giraffe!

14:28.280 --> 14:30.790
Hey. Tonight's not going the way I planned either.

14:31.080 --> 14:33.230
Enjoy your worm!

14:34.260 --> 14:35.550
I don't want a worm!

14:35.920 --> 14:38.650
Well, then... it's a sword!

14:38.910 --> 14:39.770
Cool.

14:40.060 --> 14:41.490
Let's get him!

14:53.600 --> 14:55.300
I'm scared.

14:56.350 --> 14:59.730
But it's just a movie about a mermaid and her friends.

14:59.860 --> 15:03.440
I know, but the... singing crab scares me.

15:05.330 --> 15:07.720
Oh. Oh, it's OK.

15:10.630 --> 15:13.490
Don't let us touch the floor, it's made of lava!

15:13.550 --> 15:14.390
I know.

15:15.060 --> 15:16.370
Down in front!

15:16.490 --> 15:17.860
No problem.

15:23.000 --> 15:24.350
What a wimp!

15:24.360 --> 15:26.780
Want me to call you a "wim"-bulance?

15:28.060 --> 15:31.490
Hey, hey guys! Guess what! I think the rain stopped!

15:31.830 --> 15:33.860
You kids can totally go back to the beach now!

15:34.080 --> 15:36.520
Yippee, come on, let's go!

15:36.830 --> 15:39.300
Yeah!

15:44.920 --> 15:47.740
It's barely a trickle! Come on!

16:03.570 --> 16:05.650
Where's the lovely couple?

16:05.670 --> 16:08.280
Yo, Cupid. Over here.

16:09.240 --> 16:14.050
Oh, there they are. And here I am!

16:16.680 --> 16:18.240
Little help here!

16:23.760 --> 16:27.080
Oh, Thank you.

16:27.620 --> 16:29.850
Can we move on with it, please?

16:29.860 --> 16:33.030
Oh, someone's a Naggy Nelly.

16:33.400 --> 16:36.750
Fifty years of that voice, I'm just saying.

16:37.270 --> 16:39.540
Please, we just want to get married.

16:39.840 --> 16:40.930
We don't want to miss

16:40.930 --> 16:42.680
the Late Show with Carrot Top!

16:42.730 --> 16:46.520
-Oh, you got me tickets to Carrot Top! -Surprise!

16:46.720 --> 16:51.770
Oh, you two are so cute. And so very young.

16:52.130 --> 16:57.450
So very, very, very, very...

16:58.140 --> 17:02.790
Mr. Stewart! Mr. Stewart!

17:02.910 --> 17:05.490
Very, very, 'a' very...

17:05.510 --> 17:08.480
Young! We get it. Can we get married now?

17:08.640 --> 17:10.960
Oh. Of course.

17:11.089 --> 17:15.180
Of course. Of course. Of course.

17:15.420 --> 17:20.849
Of course. Of course. Of course.

17:20.859 --> 17:23.970
I love this shower man and that's a fact

17:24.810 --> 17:28.160
Now it's time to scrub my hairy back.

17:29.130 --> 17:32.690
Of course. Of course. Of course!

17:32.720 --> 17:35.170
Oh, this is agonizing!

17:35.180 --> 17:37.690
Oh, speaking of agonizing

17:38.000 --> 17:40.570
her voice, I'm just saying!

17:40.630 --> 17:42.670
I happen to love her voice.

17:43.080 --> 17:43.950
Really?

17:44.800 --> 17:45.710
Argh...

17:46.830 --> 17:48.970
That's it! We don't need you.

17:48.970 --> 17:51.320
This city is crawling with cupids.

17:51.320 --> 17:52.660
You're not going anywhere!

17:54.430 --> 17:57.010
Say hello to my little friend!

17:58.860 --> 18:01.360
Um. Owgh?

18:03.410 --> 18:06.800
Oh, give it up, Stupid Cupid!

18:08.000 --> 18:09.930
Fifty years of that voice.

18:14.000 --> 18:17.560
I'm just saying!

18:20.000 --> 18:21.800
I can't let you guys do this.

18:22.000 --> 18:23.050
Hannah?

18:23.530 --> 18:24.420
You gotta listen to me,

18:24.420 --> 18:26.200
this is the biggest mistake of your life.

18:28.570 --> 18:29.660
OK.

18:30.590 --> 18:31.620
OK?

18:33.630 --> 18:34.820
Gotcha!

18:35.650 --> 18:36.610
Oh no!

18:37.530 --> 18:39.820
That's right, Hannah Montana!

18:39.970 --> 18:43.860
You are this week's victim on... Gotcha!

18:45.000 --> 18:47.910
Hold up there! Stop the wedding!

18:48.560 --> 18:50.110
Little late there, Daddy.

18:51.250 --> 18:54.270
Hey! Who's getting Gotcha-ed?

18:56.510 --> 19:00.340
Ohhh... gotta go.

19:00.680 --> 19:02.680
Argh, wait up!

19:02.690 --> 19:03.770
Love your show.

19:13.510 --> 19:15.330
I cannot believe you did this to me.

19:16.330 --> 19:17.340
Look, I'm sorry,

19:17.340 --> 19:19.500
we figured you'd just run and yelling

19:19.510 --> 19:20.840
"hey, stop the wedding!"

19:21.120 --> 19:23.040
But we didn't think you'd wear this...

19:23.040 --> 19:25.680
bad suit... and prop wings.

19:26.540 --> 19:28.020
You know, maybe this is a joke to you,

19:28.020 --> 19:29.200
but I was really worried.

19:29.570 --> 19:30.850
You were, weren't you.

19:30.860 --> 19:32.260
Of course I was, you big dummy.

19:33.000 --> 19:35.860
You're one of my best friends, I really care about you.

19:36.140 --> 19:37.050
I am?

19:37.580 --> 19:39.970
Like one of those best friends you can't stay mad at...

19:40.000 --> 19:41.790
even when they really mess up?

19:43.210 --> 19:44.590
Yes.

19:45.220 --> 19:47.550
OK, well then stop hitting me.

19:47.760 --> 19:48.500
OK.

19:49.010 --> 19:50.200
Now I'm good.

19:51.410 --> 19:52.880
I really am sorry.

19:53.680 --> 19:56.610
Just didn't realize... you know, you were still so into me.

19:58.000 --> 19:59.450
You did not just go there!

20:00.260 --> 20:02.990
Oh, come on. You're telling me

20:03.070 --> 20:06.010
that that was all about me and Traci being too young?

20:06.350 --> 20:08.100
Nothing about you and me?

20:09.000 --> 20:10.700
Look, Jake.

20:11.320 --> 20:13.570
I know we had a thing once, but it is over.

20:13.650 --> 20:16.590
I'm done. Moved on. I feel nothing.

20:16.750 --> 20:18.920
Good, because I feel less than nothing.

20:18.920 --> 20:19.560
Oh, good.

20:19.560 --> 20:21.670
Cause if you dug under the less than nothing that you feel,

20:21.670 --> 20:22.440
you get what I feel,

20:22.500 --> 20:24.220
but you wouldn't feel anything cause I feel nothing.

20:24.360 --> 20:25.110
Oh yeah?

20:25.120 --> 20:26.640
Yeah. And I'll prove it to you.

20:28.610 --> 20:30.820
There. Like kissing a catfish...

20:30.870 --> 20:34.590
a dead, cold catfish with slimy lips.

20:38.800 --> 20:40.150
Whoa.

20:40.430 --> 20:41.900
Whoa.

20:51.340 --> 20:55.430
Stupid Rico! Whiny brats!

20:56.130 --> 20:59.170
Kid No.3 needs to go No.2, Jackson!

21:00.330 --> 21:03.830
Just show him to the bathroom, I'll take care of your lady.

21:03.950 --> 21:06.850
Muhahahaha... hi Allison.

21:07.460 --> 21:11.510
Hey.  You know, things got so crazy last night,

21:11.520 --> 21:14.540
I didn't get a chance to say how great you were with the kids.

21:14.780 --> 21:15.570
Oh yeah.

21:15.620 --> 21:17.920
Oh, well, I just love the little critters;

21:17.920 --> 21:19.840
they're just so cute.

21:20.170 --> 21:22.100
Well, I just wanted to thank you.

21:22.100 --> 21:24.530
I mean, it wasn't exactly a date, but...

21:24.530 --> 21:25.820
I had a lot of fun.

21:26.410 --> 21:27.780
-Really?  -Yeah.

21:27.830 --> 21:30.710
Well, you know, we were sort of in the middle of something

21:30.710 --> 21:32.630
before we were so rudely interrupted.

21:32.640 --> 21:33.370
Oh, we were?

21:33.880 --> 21:35.670
You're gonna have to jog my memory.

21:40.900 --> 21:42.310
Sorry... I just argh...

21:43.540 --> 21:44.830
Are you getting sick?

21:45.120 --> 21:46.790
No I always sneeze when I'm happy.

21:50.030 --> 21:51.460
And I cough too.

21:51.790 --> 21:53.210
You're getting sick.

21:53.230 --> 21:55.510
You know what maybe we should do this another time.

21:55.520 --> 21:56.420
No no no wait -

21:56.700 --> 21:58.090
I think I'm feeling better.

22:02.430 --> 22:03.670
Ewgh!

22:05.070 --> 22:07.730
But it's a cute "newgh" right?

22:07.860 --> 22:08.770
Right!

22:17.710 --> 22:21.090
Rico!
