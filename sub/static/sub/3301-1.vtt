<i>No!</i>

00:04.822 --> 00:06.056
<i>Mum!</i>

00:06.156 --> 00:07.852
<i>Please stop.</i>

00:10.202 --> 00:13.060
<i>No, please! Just leave us alone!</i>

00:13.997 --> 00:16.233
<i>- Mum!
- Please don't...</i>

00:16.332 --> 00:17.901
<i>Don't do it!</i>

00:29.888 --> 00:30.873
<i>Mum.</i>

00:35.936 --> 00:37.466
<i>Mum!</i>

01:54.222 --> 01:58.794
- Hey, you okay? Okay?
- Please help me, they killed my mum.

01:58.894 --> 02:02.299
- What? Who?
- Red masks. The men in red masks.

02:03.357 --> 02:05.717
Have you been kidnapped, too?

02:07.486 --> 02:08.512
Yeah, I think so.

02:08.612 --> 02:11.765
Please. Please untie me.

02:11.865 --> 02:13.514
Okay, okay.

02:19.164 --> 02:21.817
- What happened?
- They shot her.

02:21.917 --> 02:26.077
The men in red masks, they came
to our house and shot her.

02:27.631 --> 02:30.367
Hey, hey. I'm sorry. Listen...
What's your name?

02:30.467 --> 02:32.330
Alex.

02:32.511 --> 02:36.165
Okay, Alex. You're being very brave.

02:36.265 --> 02:39.040
I need you to be brave for
a little bit longer, okay?

02:39.768 --> 02:41.880
I'm gonna go and get some help.

03:05.002 --> 03:08.869
Listen, you need to wait for
it to stop moving, okay?

03:16.346 --> 03:17.876
Okay. Go.

04:39.263 --> 04:40.995
My leg.

05:02.661 --> 05:04.475
My leg!

05:05.330 --> 05:07.026
What's your name?

05:07.666 --> 05:09.445
It's Ryan.

05:09.835 --> 05:11.614
Ryan.

05:12.004 --> 05:14.115
How come you were in the van?

05:15.174 --> 05:16.700
I have no idea.

05:16.800 --> 05:18.869
The last thing I
remember is at Hibiscus.

05:18.969 --> 05:21.875
Reading a chemistry text
book Dr. Langham gave me.

05:22.973 --> 05:25.297
And I wasn't in London.

05:26.143 --> 05:28.754
- Why would someone kidnap you?
- I don't know.

05:28.854 --> 05:30.047
I just want my mum back.

05:36.779 --> 05:39.768
Look, I'm gonna go
to the police, okay?

05:40.282 --> 05:42.893
- What did you say about his biscuits?
- Hibiscus.

05:42.993 --> 05:44.019
What's that?

05:44.119 --> 05:46.693
A rehab facility.
It's kind of like a hospital.

05:47.164 --> 05:50.236
I've been there for a few years,
was your mum there?

05:51.794 --> 05:52.945
Are you sick?

05:53.045 --> 05:54.905
It's called post-traumatic
stress disorder.

05:55.005 --> 05:58.244
I get dizzy spells.

05:58.884 --> 06:01.873
Panic attacks and nightmares.

06:02.262 --> 06:04.421
Although this seems very real.

06:07.184 --> 06:09.342
Except, I don't have my ring.

06:10.270 --> 06:12.512
And I've never seen this before.

06:15.275 --> 06:16.620
June.

07:10.748 --> 07:13.317
- My watch says June the seventh.
- That's today.

07:13.417 --> 07:15.112
Are you sure?

07:15.919 --> 07:19.205
But when I went to
sleep it was January.

07:31.518 --> 07:34.211
Hey! Where are you?

08:08.138 --> 08:09.206
Hello?

08:09.306 --> 08:10.919
Where are you?

08:40.629 --> 08:43.907
No! It was you! It was you!

08:44.006 --> 08:46.082
You! You did it!

08:46.260 --> 08:50.080
You did it! You killed my mum!

08:50.180 --> 08:51.710
Help!

09:55.746 --> 09:57.738
Alex!

10:24.441 --> 10:26.968
Ten days.

10:34.660 --> 10:36.902
Hello!

11:25.169 --> 11:28.538
Hibiscus Trauma Unit US, call.

11:33.218 --> 11:35.163
Hello, Hibiscus?

11:37.347 --> 11:39.162
What do you mean, "Wrong number"?

11:40.559 --> 11:43.417
How can they have
been closed for years?

11:44.313 --> 11:46.215
What year is this?

11:46.315 --> 11:49.173
This year now,
right now, what year is this?

12:23.727 --> 12:25.921
I heard you shout, you okay?

12:26.980 --> 12:28.795
Everything all right?

12:29.775 --> 12:31.844
Yeah.

12:31.944 --> 12:34.802
I knocked the table, I was annoyed.

12:36.031 --> 12:37.057
I bet you were.

12:37.157 --> 12:40.977
It's a 200-year-old single malt
you love telling me about.

12:45.499 --> 12:47.942
Shall we go over it,
so we're all clear?

12:50.504 --> 12:51.905
Everything's in place.

12:52.005 --> 12:54.533
The tests from Leonid show that
it works on a long-term trial,

12:54.633 --> 12:55.701
as you know.

12:55.801 --> 12:57.411
So we're still on schedule.

12:57.511 --> 13:00.247
The medic from the interrogation
center had his little accident.

13:00.347 --> 13:02.041
So your alias is Cedric Saunders,

13:02.141 --> 13:03.834
and it stood up with
their background checks.

13:03.934 --> 13:06.712
You start in five weeks,
the mercenaries are on standby.

13:06.812 --> 13:09.798
And finally the electron
micrograph came from Kiev,

13:09.898 --> 13:13.350
so the lab's fully equipped
and ready for our scientists.

13:18.198 --> 13:20.476
Imagine all those individuals

13:20.576 --> 13:24.355
locked in their own heads and they're
thinking of who or what they hurt.

13:24.455 --> 13:26.648
Imagine we get those drones online.

13:28.542 --> 13:30.027
What about the boy?

13:30.127 --> 13:32.196
He's fine. The driver's gone.

13:32.296 --> 13:34.198
I handled it.

13:34.298 --> 13:37.951
We can't have any more incidents
like we did at the graveyard.

13:38.427 --> 13:40.419
You sure you're okay?

13:45.851 --> 13:47.844
Have a drink.

13:54.026 --> 13:56.220
You want to see the feed?

13:58.906 --> 14:02.559
<i>Welcome, Harkin.
What can I do for you today?</i>

14:10.334 --> 14:12.860
<i>Hibiscus Project online.</i>

14:23.555 --> 14:25.833
What are you doing to him?

14:28.060 --> 14:29.969
It happened again, didn't it?

15:53.228 --> 15:56.048
Your name is Ryan Reeve. Isn't it?

15:56.148 --> 15:58.550
You're good, but I'm still better.

15:58.650 --> 16:00.636
I started at a very young age.

16:00.736 --> 16:01.845
My father always taught me,

16:01.945 --> 16:04.306
"A man can't use his mind,
until he knows how to use his body."

16:04.406 --> 16:05.557
Good lesson.

16:05.657 --> 16:07.309
Worth all the scars.

16:07.409 --> 16:09.144
You probably won't come back.

16:09.244 --> 16:10.688
But if you do,

16:10.788 --> 16:14.441
stop, wait it out,
don't talk to anyone,

16:14.541 --> 16:17.736
don't operate machinery,
if you're driving, pull over.

16:17.836 --> 16:20.239
You won't have time to
achieve anything anyway.

16:20.339 --> 16:23.909
The reboot only takes nine
minutes and 47 seconds.

16:24.134 --> 16:27.913
But still, why don't we
make this a short one?

17:02.840 --> 17:04.998
I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry.

17:25.612 --> 17:27.771
What am I doing here?

17:28.156 --> 17:30.017
If you don't know that,
maybe I'm not the person

17:30.117 --> 17:33.023
with the most problems in the room.

17:35.581 --> 17:37.441
You told me to play dead.

17:37.541 --> 17:39.450
Why?

17:39.585 --> 17:42.906
I guess

17:43.255 --> 17:45.248
because you like it.

17:45.424 --> 17:49.327
You paid Sergio a lot of money
and I don't ask questions.

17:52.681 --> 17:54.626
Three weeks?

17:56.018 --> 17:58.758
Did I mention a kid,
a boy called Alex?

18:02.441 --> 18:04.009
What's your name?

18:04.109 --> 18:05.302
I've told you already.

18:05.402 --> 18:07.098
Tell me again.

18:09.239 --> 18:10.971
Dana.

18:11.784 --> 18:13.602
You've been shouting it enough.

18:13.702 --> 18:16.188
"I'm gonna make you beg, Dana."

18:16.288 --> 18:18.150
That sort of thing.

18:18.791 --> 18:21.032
I'm sorry, Dana.

18:21.293 --> 18:24.405
The person who I was just then,
that's not who I am now.

18:24.505 --> 18:26.699
A crazy thing is happening to me.

18:26.799 --> 18:29.660
I wake up in these situations and
I don't know how I got there.

18:29.760 --> 18:32.079
But the guy that was doing
that to you is not me.

18:32.179 --> 18:33.911
So, who are you?

18:34.181 --> 18:35.624
Who was he?

18:35.724 --> 18:36.959
I don't know.

18:37.059 --> 18:40.504
Mmm. Right. You still got
an hour, mystery man,

18:40.604 --> 18:42.506
so are we gonna play this
game or the first one?

18:42.606 --> 18:44.633
I need to find Dr. Langham.

18:44.733 --> 18:46.885
I don't want to wear these,
do you have anything else?

18:46.985 --> 18:50.511
Only things clients have
left behind, in the trunk.

19:04.420 --> 19:06.572
When I came in, was there
another man with me?

19:06.672 --> 19:08.451
Bright blue eyes.

19:08.632 --> 19:10.625
I don't know.

19:23.689 --> 19:25.847
Nine minutes, 47 seconds.

19:30.946 --> 19:33.140
Okay, get dressed.

19:33.699 --> 19:35.643
- Why?
- We're leaving.

19:35.826 --> 19:39.396
No, no, no. I'm never allowed
to leave. Sergio owns me.

19:41.915 --> 19:44.157
I'm gonna handle Sergio.

19:44.334 --> 19:47.571
And you're gonna do what I tell you,
do you understand me?

19:47.671 --> 19:51.621
My, my. We haven't changed
much at all, have we?

19:55.596 --> 19:57.754
Hurry up.

20:01.727 --> 20:03.212
What is this music?

20:03.312 --> 20:05.464
Sergio's favorite. He plays
it throughout the house

20:05.564 --> 20:08.801
to remind girls and
clients who is in charge.

20:08.901 --> 20:11.845
Well, like I said,
I'm gonna deal with Sergio.

20:11.945 --> 20:14.768
No, I expect he'll
be dealing with you.

20:20.996 --> 20:22.606
Why do you do this?

20:22.706 --> 20:24.608
Why do any of us do anything?

20:24.708 --> 20:27.403
Yeah, but you don't like it, you're not
feeding a habit, so why are you here?

20:27.503 --> 20:29.571
Life has brought me here.

20:29.671 --> 20:31.824
So if you weren't here,
what would you be doing?

20:31.924 --> 20:33.534
Go back to my hometown.

20:33.634 --> 20:34.994
Finish nursing school.

20:35.094 --> 20:36.203
What's your town like?

20:36.303 --> 20:37.454
This is pointless.

20:37.554 --> 20:38.998
What's your town like?

20:40.265 --> 20:41.583
Quiet.

20:41.683 --> 20:43.795
Under a mountain.

20:44.186 --> 20:45.963
Nice houses with brightly painted

20:46.063 --> 20:48.674
window frames and
white picket fences.

20:48.774 --> 20:50.175
I miss it.

20:50.275 --> 20:52.094
So like I said, why are you here?

20:52.194 --> 20:53.971
My son was sick.

20:54.071 --> 20:57.308
His care was very expensive, I had
to borrow a lot of money, quickly.

20:57.408 --> 20:59.352
I didn't know where to go.

21:00.244 --> 21:02.236
So I came here.

21:02.955 --> 21:06.573
When you owe somebody
that much, they own you.

21:07.167 --> 21:09.030
So how is your boy now?

21:10.462 --> 21:12.656
His name is Eden.

21:14.174 --> 21:15.989
He died.

21:17.261 --> 21:19.123
I'm sorry.

21:19.263 --> 21:21.206
No you're not.

21:21.306 --> 21:22.541
<i>Thank you for your custom.</i>

21:22.641 --> 21:24.293
<i>House rules state that only one</i>

21:24.393 --> 21:26.253
<i>customer may leave at any time.</i>

21:26.353 --> 21:28.589
<i>This door will now
lock for two minutes.</i>

21:28.689 --> 21:31.008
<i>View our selection of
girls in front of you.</i>

21:31.108 --> 21:33.552
<i>Book your favorite by
scheduling an outcall</i>

21:33.652 --> 21:36.513
<i>and have all your dreams come true.</i>

21:36.613 --> 21:38.309
You're Sergio?

21:39.158 --> 21:41.850
He doesn't speak much English.

21:42.119 --> 21:43.812
Hey.

21:43.912 --> 21:46.065
One of you tell Sergio
I'm taking this girl out.

21:55.716 --> 21:59.495
He says you, "Just because
you pick the girl from line

21:59.595 --> 22:02.414
"does not mean you leave with her.

22:02.514 --> 22:04.542
"She belong to me."

22:06.852 --> 22:08.547
That wasn't me.

22:13.317 --> 22:14.843
You look same,

22:14.943 --> 22:16.473
who it was.

22:16.779 --> 22:18.593
Who are you?

22:19.615 --> 22:22.017
I'm not entirely sure.

22:22.117 --> 22:24.394
But you're welcome
to try and find out.

22:48.977 --> 22:50.922
Come on now!

23:29.351 --> 23:31.165
Hey!

23:49.913 --> 23:52.487
I think we can help each other.

24:00.799 --> 24:03.035
Please, please don't scream.

24:03.135 --> 24:05.204
Here, take this.

24:05.304 --> 24:07.539
That's enough for you
to get away from Sergio.

24:07.639 --> 24:09.375
I just need you to do me a favor.

24:09.475 --> 24:12.544
I need you to go to the police,
and I need you to tell them about me.

24:12.644 --> 24:15.214
I kidnapped a child called Alex,
and I shot his mother...

24:15.314 --> 24:17.549
If you want to be arrested,
why not just go turn yourself in?

24:17.649 --> 24:20.302
'Cause I only get 10 minutes,
and when I change I won't want to.

24:20.402 --> 24:22.012
Change into what?

24:22.112 --> 24:24.721
Do this for me and you
get your freedom back.

24:27.826 --> 24:28.978
You have no idea.

24:29.078 --> 24:32.231
Sergio will come for me and he
will not stop until he's found me.

24:32.331 --> 24:36.534
Look, you've lost a kid,
we can help this one.

24:42.966 --> 24:44.451
Please.

24:44.551 --> 24:46.247
Please.

25:20.421 --> 25:22.823
You didn't tell me
we were in New York.

25:22.923 --> 25:25.035
Where did you think you were?

26:43.128 --> 26:44.989
Hey! Hey!

26:45.089 --> 26:48.991
Back up! Back the fuck up! Back up!

26:49.968 --> 26:52.661
You all right? You okay?

26:58.602 --> 27:01.422
...three terrorist, four
terrorist, five terrorist,

27:01.522 --> 27:03.007
six terrorist, seven terrorist,

27:03.107 --> 27:06.013
eight terrorist,
nine terrorist, 10 terrorist.

27:06.944 --> 27:10.472
One terrorist, two terrorist,
three terrorist, four terrorist,

27:10.572 --> 27:12.975
five terrorist,
six terrorist, seven terrorist,

27:13.075 --> 27:16.064
eight terrorist,
nine terrorist, 10 terrorist.

27:16.328 --> 27:18.024
Up.

27:20.165 --> 27:23.404
Where's the research, 43543?

27:32.845 --> 27:35.748
We're not gonna stop till
we've got what we need.

27:35.848 --> 27:39.293
You talk, and we all go get a slice
of pie and enjoy the sunshine.

27:39.393 --> 27:41.717
What do you say, Mr. Scientist?

27:42.646 --> 27:45.049
- Fuck you.
- You want some more?

27:45.149 --> 27:46.383
Let's go again, right now!

27:46.483 --> 27:50.510
Wait. We've gotta give him, what?
Five, 10 minutes? Right, Doc?

27:55.075 --> 27:56.937
Doc.

27:57.411 --> 28:00.733
We can't break him with one hand
tied behind our backs like this.

28:01.373 --> 28:03.776
You don't know how it is with Leonid.

28:03.876 --> 28:05.152
Leonid.

28:05.252 --> 28:08.322
Two years we've been
processing him, not a peep.

28:08.422 --> 28:12.455
Now, the old doctor, he was
real big on prisoner's rights.

28:12.718 --> 28:14.703
How about the rights
of ordinary, decent people

28:14.803 --> 28:17.122
to sleep peacefully in
their beds at night

28:17.222 --> 28:19.963
without worrying about
a sick fuck like him?

28:20.809 --> 28:23.418
How about letting us
bend the rules a little?

28:24.688 --> 28:26.800
Where are we?

28:27.775 --> 28:30.636
Are you fucking with me?
You don't know where we are?

28:30.736 --> 28:32.764
Is there a problem?

28:33.739 --> 28:36.100
Come on, Doc. What the fuck?

28:36.200 --> 28:37.810
You know where we are is classified,

28:37.910 --> 28:39.985
and if you don't, I can't tell you.

28:40.162 --> 28:41.941
Okay.

28:45.709 --> 28:48.236
He's having some kind of episode.

28:48.545 --> 28:52.697
We should just do what we've got to do.
He's not going to tell anyone.

28:55.094 --> 28:57.086
There was a boy.

28:57.930 --> 28:59.922
A child.

29:00.933 --> 29:03.293
And there was a girl,
Dana, a prostitute.

29:03.393 --> 29:04.837
She was helping me,
and then Sergio...

29:04.937 --> 29:08.471
What are you talking about?
Just do your fucking job!

29:09.983 --> 29:12.386
I keep blacking out and...

29:12.486 --> 29:14.561
I kidnapped a kid.

29:14.738 --> 29:17.099
I don't know where he
is now, because I'm me...

29:17.199 --> 29:19.685
I mean, I am the "me" I am now.

29:19.785 --> 29:22.730
But soon I will change and I'll know,
but I won't want to tell you.

29:22.830 --> 29:24.523
Now, I know how this sounds.
I know this sounds crazy,

29:24.623 --> 29:26.066
but please, you have to believe me.

29:26.166 --> 29:28.574
There's a child's life at stake.

29:32.464 --> 29:34.623
He's got something strapped to him.

29:38.220 --> 29:41.248
Doc, come on! I will shoot you!

29:41.348 --> 29:43.756
Give it up, Doc!

30:44.036 --> 30:46.645
Down! Down! Get the fuck down!

30:49.208 --> 30:51.193
The mask, give it to me!

30:51.293 --> 30:53.278
- You're the scientist?
- Of course, yes.

30:53.378 --> 30:54.947
Is there a technology
that allows people

30:55.047 --> 30:56.281
to control somebody else's mind?

30:56.381 --> 30:57.783
This is hardly the time.

30:57.883 --> 30:59.326
Tell me about mind control!

30:59.426 --> 31:01.412
I have heard of such a program.

31:01.512 --> 31:05.082
- Experimental death, called droning.
- How is it done?

31:05.724 --> 31:07.251
How is it done?

31:07.351 --> 31:13.090
The host body holds a receiver,
like a modem receiving a signal.

31:13.190 --> 31:14.675
Where?

31:14.775 --> 31:16.593
All neurological impulses go through

31:16.693 --> 31:18.554
the basal ganglia in
the back of the neck,

31:18.654 --> 31:22.307
so probably there.
Now, the mask, please.

31:36.588 --> 31:39.115
Now how are we going
to get out of here?

31:39.967 --> 31:41.876
Hey! Hey!

31:42.219 --> 31:44.455
Are you the contact?
What happens now?

31:44.555 --> 31:46.457
Where is the laboratory?

31:46.557 --> 31:48.798
Where are Dr. Langham's people?

31:49.184 --> 31:52.470
It's his plan! What now?

31:57.025 --> 31:59.801
I see they've redesigned
the chronometer.

32:01.405 --> 32:04.058
The new spectrograph 406.

32:04.158 --> 32:07.692
They must've brought it out
while I was indisposed.

32:08.203 --> 32:11.275
A wide-spectrum deprillator.

32:11.498 --> 32:12.983
Already configured.

32:13.083 --> 32:16.320
And after months of waiting
and fragmented communication,

32:16.420 --> 32:20.998
you break me out of my cell and
give me a nice new laboratory.

32:21.300 --> 32:23.494
Thank you so very much.

32:25.554 --> 32:28.211
Gentlemen, let's celebrate.

32:32.686 --> 32:37.716
Hey, the studio's benefactor
number two, have a glass.

32:40.360 --> 32:42.851
To a fruitful collaboration.

32:43.238 --> 32:45.183
<i>Nostrovia!</i>

32:49.119 --> 32:54.696
Now that I see you are men of your
word, let me show you something.

33:04.551 --> 33:07.576
All my work, right here.

33:12.559 --> 33:14.374
Ingenious.

33:14.728 --> 33:18.631
Kept all your work right
under their noses for years.

33:24.571 --> 33:29.233
This stuff is far too good
for governments to know.

33:42.089 --> 33:44.746
You know why I am the best? Hmm?

33:45.759 --> 33:48.287
Because I can see the aesthetics.

33:48.387 --> 33:51.459
My contemporaries are vulgarians.

33:51.598 --> 33:56.296
They see only RNA bases, enzymes.

33:57.062 --> 33:59.298
I see

33:59.398 --> 34:01.556
Picasso.

34:01.734 --> 34:05.470
Biology's purest sculpture.

34:05.946 --> 34:07.855
The virus.

34:10.701 --> 34:13.646
I'll make something simple and nasty.

34:13.746 --> 34:15.856
An airborne pathogen

34:15.956 --> 34:21.070
that messes with DNA in a
particularly baroque fashion.

34:21.170 --> 34:25.114
Makes the subject grow
some extra eyes, say.

34:25.215 --> 34:27.784
I'll make it very contagious.

34:27.885 --> 34:29.953
We show them it works.

34:30.053 --> 34:34.041
We threaten to release it over
some densely populated cities.

34:34.141 --> 34:37.841
And we all grow obscenely rich.

34:39.271 --> 34:42.639
Yeah, about that.

34:42.940 --> 34:44.426
That's all very interesting,

34:44.525 --> 34:48.514
- very "baroque" was it you said?
- Mmm.

34:48.614 --> 34:51.520
Well, actually, Leonid,

34:51.658 --> 34:54.728
we may have mislead you, somewhat.

34:54.828 --> 34:59.108
I mean, do we need
your expertise? Yes.

34:59.208 --> 35:02.363
Do we need you to build
this bespoke virus? Yes.

35:02.669 --> 35:06.288
But are we going to blackmail
governments for money?

35:07.257 --> 35:09.120
No.

35:09.259 --> 35:11.036
No, we're not.

35:11.136 --> 35:15.620
We're not interested in blackmail here,
and we don't need money.

35:16.433 --> 35:19.586
You may not understand this,

35:19.686 --> 35:23.424
but our ambitions are a little

35:23.524 --> 35:25.050
wider.

35:25.150 --> 35:28.304
I will not work if I do
not agree to the cause.

35:28.404 --> 35:30.306
I'm very well aware of that.

35:30.406 --> 35:32.398
Let me show you something.

35:43.544 --> 35:46.153
No, no, no, no!

35:46.880 --> 35:48.907
Stop! You'll die.

35:49.007 --> 35:51.201
- Back away.
- What are you doing?

36:01.478 --> 36:03.756
Lucky it's not too deep.

36:10.738 --> 36:14.640
All right, I'm gonna stay
here until this one's over.

36:30.466 --> 36:33.039
A change of plans, I think.

36:34.845 --> 36:37.247
What nonsense this is, I do not know.

36:37.347 --> 36:39.166
But it proves one thing.

36:39.266 --> 36:42.336
You have ceased to be of use.

36:42.436 --> 36:45.005
So thank you very
much for my freedom,

36:45.105 --> 36:48.008
and an excellent place to work.

36:48.108 --> 36:51.387
But I will go from here alone.

36:51.487 --> 36:53.135
It's DNA coded.

36:54.281 --> 36:56.309
You need an override code.

36:57.868 --> 37:00.521
So why don't you relax

37:00.621 --> 37:03.112
and watch some TV.

37:08.629 --> 37:10.324
What is this?

37:12.132 --> 37:14.034
<i>Hello, Leonid.</i>

37:14.134 --> 37:18.002
<i>The boy, of course, is Alex.
I believe you know him.</i>

37:18.305 --> 37:19.581
What have you done to my son?

37:19.681 --> 37:22.042
<i>No, please! Just leave
us alone. Please don't...</i>

37:24.353 --> 37:26.167
<i>No! Mum!</i>

37:26.480 --> 37:28.045
<i>Mum, no.</i>

37:28.565 --> 37:32.052
<i>I killed the mother,
but your son is still alive.</i>

37:32.152 --> 37:34.930
<i>Although, perhaps not
for long, my dear boy.</i>

37:35.030 --> 37:37.016
<i>The acid between the
sheets is irreversibly</i>

37:37.116 --> 37:38.892
<i>spreading to wards your son's body</i>

37:38.992 --> 37:41.103
<i>and can only be stopped by us.</i>

37:41.203 --> 37:43.105
<i>It's a little much, I admit.</i>

37:43.205 --> 37:47.234
<i>But it's a visual incentive and I
do have a penchant for theatrics.</i>

37:47.334 --> 37:50.279
<i>I give you my word, your son will
be released if you do what we say.</i>

37:50.379 --> 37:52.870
<i>All your instructions
are in front of you.</i>

37:53.006 --> 37:56.535
Leonid. We can save Alex.

37:56.635 --> 38:00.039
But we need to act fast before
I change back into him.

38:00.139 --> 38:04.207
I'm gonna black out soon and
there isn't much time left.

38:15.195 --> 38:17.389
Leonid.

38:23.245 --> 38:27.064
<i>Two, one. Manual shutdown.</i>

38:28.125 --> 38:31.529
We are no longer
transmitting, which means...

38:32.504 --> 38:34.497
Hello, Ryan.

38:35.716 --> 38:37.578
Let's see.

38:38.802 --> 38:40.287
Pulse normal.

38:40.387 --> 38:42.498
Within tolerance.
The ports are clear.

38:42.598 --> 38:44.458
There's nothing wrong with the

38:44.558 --> 38:46.543
old receiver tech.
It's embedded nicely.

38:46.643 --> 38:47.878
The vocal chords have been disabled,

38:47.978 --> 38:50.839
and I've fixed the self-inflicted
damage on the right side of the neck

38:50.939 --> 38:53.175
and opened the node
portal on the left.

38:53.275 --> 38:55.010
I've gone over all the
transmission equipment.

38:55.110 --> 38:57.055
It's working perfectly.

38:58.113 --> 39:03.852
So, it has to be a fault or
interference with the satellite.

39:04.369 --> 39:06.146
Quite frankly, there's nothing
we can do about that,

39:06.246 --> 39:10.235
'cause it might just happen more,
and possibly more randomly.

39:10.959 --> 39:13.362
Every now and again,
soldier boy is gonna get his head back

39:13.462 --> 39:15.239
until the reboot kicks
in automatically.

39:15.339 --> 39:18.659
Which, as we have seen,
is plenty of time for him

39:18.759 --> 39:20.828
to make quite a mess of things.

39:20.928 --> 39:24.498
He's incredibly persistent.

39:28.560 --> 39:32.628
All I have to do is
just slit this vein.

39:32.731 --> 39:37.096
I know that I can take care of
everything on my own from here.

39:37.694 --> 39:39.805
We'll discuss this when you get back.

39:39.905 --> 39:41.932
Bug repair the subject.

39:42.032 --> 39:45.057
I'd keep still if I were you, Ryan.

39:52.126 --> 39:54.319
Good night, Ryan.

39:56.088 --> 39:59.029
I really hope we don't meet again.

40:09.601 --> 40:11.214
Alex.

40:15.065 --> 40:17.888
Another transmission failure, huh?

40:20.946 --> 40:22.891
Hello, Ryan.

40:24.032 --> 40:26.769
It's a crude solution,
I admit, laughably simple.

40:26.869 --> 40:28.228
My idea.

40:28.328 --> 40:33.233
Your entrance, we noted, was marked
by a moment of involuntary spasm.

40:33.333 --> 40:37.201
So we're using that. You wake up,
you drop the ball, it inflates,

40:37.629 --> 40:39.239
you go down for a little sleep.

40:39.339 --> 40:41.575
Soon as you're back,
you're gone again.

40:41.675 --> 40:44.328
There's a grand plan, Ryan.

40:44.428 --> 40:46.038
Why are you fighting it?

40:46.138 --> 40:47.915
Why do you even care?

40:48.015 --> 40:51.799
Honestly, this really has
nothing to do with you.

41:09.536 --> 41:13.607
We upped the dose a little bit,
so it'll be straight back down.

41:13.832 --> 41:16.527
That's it, let the
drugs do their thing.

41:16.627 --> 41:19.568
Don't fight it. Don't panic
everyone, he's okay.

41:25.344 --> 41:26.873
Sergio.

42:20.441 --> 42:23.216
You're the one controlling me.

42:29.158 --> 42:31.102
Dr. Langham.

42:56.393 --> 42:57.711
Alex.

42:57.811 --> 43:00.302
Nine minutes and 47 seconds.

43:14.119 --> 43:16.194
<i>Initiated.</i>

43:21.001 --> 43:22.277
<i>What can I do for you?</i>

43:22.377 --> 43:23.696
Police.

43:23.796 --> 43:25.030
<i>Requires override code.</i>

43:25.130 --> 43:26.156
Location.

43:26.256 --> 43:27.241
<i>Requires override code.</i>

43:27.341 --> 43:29.832
Dr. Francis Langham.

43:33.013 --> 43:36.834
<i>Dr. Langham, tell us about the
work of the Hibiscus Trauma Unit?</i>

43:36.934 --> 43:39.420
<i>We treat severely traumatized
young men and women,</i>

43:39.520 --> 43:41.380
<i>men such as Ryan here.</i>

43:41.480 --> 43:43.966
<i>He served three tours,
all of them hot.</i>

43:44.066 --> 43:46.343
<i>And it all just got too much?</i>

43:46.443 --> 43:48.304
<i>As it does for most.</i>

43:48.404 --> 43:50.597
<i>The source of his
trauma lies elsewhere.</i>

43:50.697 --> 43:53.267
<i>Do talk about it, my dear boy.</i>

43:53.367 --> 43:56.437
<i>Two years ago,
my wife and I left dinner.</i>

43:56.537 --> 43:58.605
<i>She was so tired and I just couldn't</i>

43:58.705 --> 44:00.941
<i>decide if I wanted to drive or not.</i>

44:01.041 --> 44:03.568
<i>She got in and she drove.</i>

44:04.545 --> 44:08.779
<i>We crashed and she died,
and all I got was this scar.</i>

44:09.425 --> 44:12.119
<i>Do you think your feelings of
guilt led to your condition?</i>

44:12.219 --> 44:14.288
<i>I just know I should've
driven that night.</i>

44:14.388 --> 44:16.874
<i>Well done, Ryan. It's important
what you read at night.</i>

44:16.974 --> 44:19.543
<i>It sets the tone for your sleep.</i>

44:19.643 --> 44:21.962
<i>We've done a lot of
neurological tinkering.</i>

44:22.062 --> 44:23.213
<i>A lot of therapy.</i>

44:23.313 --> 44:25.507
<i>And he's traveling on the right road.</i>

44:25.607 --> 44:26.925
<i>Isn't that so, my dear boy?</i>

44:27.025 --> 44:29.803
<i>Dr. Langham, I understand
you have been experimenting</i>

44:29.903 --> 44:32.477
<i>in the use of bioware technology?</i>

44:32.781 --> 44:35.309
<i>I understood we weren't going
to discuss that, Sandy.</i>

44:35.409 --> 44:36.644
<i>What do you say to critics</i>

44:36.744 --> 44:39.688
<i>who claim you're making radical
neurological interventions?</i>

44:39.788 --> 44:41.482
<i>That what started as a
cure for your illness...</i>

44:41.582 --> 44:43.692
<i>My illness has nothing to do with it.</i>

44:43.792 --> 44:45.694
<i>It simply hastened my research.</i>

44:45.794 --> 44:47.696
<i>What do you say to
allegations that claim</i>

44:47.796 --> 44:49.657
<i>the injured British
military you import</i>

44:49.757 --> 44:52.493
<i>is nothing to you but a source
of samples to play with?</i>

44:52.593 --> 44:54.495
<i>I want to talk about your
own bioware firm, LSR.</i>

44:54.595 --> 44:57.536
<i>We won't be talking
about that, I'm afraid.</i>

45:00.517 --> 45:03.671
<i>Hello, I'm Dr. Francis Langham.</i>

45:03.771 --> 45:05.172
<i>And I'm Harkin Langham.</i>

45:05.272 --> 45:07.508
<i>We're the family behind LSR Bioware.</i>

45:07.608 --> 45:10.844
<i>How do we advertise the
amazing things we do?</i>

45:10.944 --> 45:12.513
<i>We could show you our...</i>

45:12.613 --> 45:13.722
<i>tech company.</i>

45:13.822 --> 45:18.102
<i>But at heart,
we're just a family business.</i>

45:21.622 --> 45:24.733
<i>Recording 7315. Controller.</i>

45:24.833 --> 45:26.443
<i>Satellite.</i>

45:26.543 --> 45:28.529
<i>These are all terms
we're familiar with.</i>

45:28.629 --> 45:30.989
<i>The receiver is bioware.</i>

45:31.632 --> 45:33.409
<i>Now, we're currently
working on our beta</i>

45:33.509 --> 45:36.370
<i>and pilot test size which
will eventually be</i>

45:36.470 --> 45:37.997
<i>picotechnology.</i>

45:38.097 --> 45:41.333
<i>Coded with DNA which will give
us uninterrupted control.</i>

45:41.433 --> 45:45.170
<i>Think of it as a
bio-technological modem.</i>

45:51.318 --> 45:53.846
<i>Controversial bioware
firm LSR has been</i>

45:53.946 --> 45:56.390
<i>shut down by the
scientific ethics board.</i>

45:56.490 --> 45:59.977
<i>CEO, Francis Langham has
been called barbaric...</i>

46:34.820 --> 46:36.433
Son.

46:44.747 --> 46:47.066
Straight. As always.

46:47.166 --> 46:49.573
Of course, my dear boy!

46:54.214 --> 46:55.910
Come.

47:03.724 --> 47:05.752
That Van's still out there.

47:05.976 --> 47:08.337
It's been out there for
two days. I don't like it.

47:08.437 --> 47:09.963
I'm gonna go check it out.

47:10.063 --> 47:12.216
Son, you're too suspicious.

47:12.316 --> 47:14.718
Leonid works like a man possessed.
Everything is fine.

47:14.818 --> 47:16.303
It's all this waiting
around that's annoying.

47:16.403 --> 47:19.139
Nothing to do but wait.
It makes me edgy.

47:19.239 --> 47:20.599
That van makes me edgy.

47:20.699 --> 47:23.439
- I'm gonna go check it.
- I said stay!

47:26.705 --> 47:29.611
There's something I wish
to talk to you about.

47:31.210 --> 47:32.152
What is it?

47:32.252 --> 47:35.572
I'm having trouble
remembering a few things.

47:35.672 --> 47:38.117
Could be all the port switching
causing neural decay.

47:38.217 --> 47:41.578
You're also getting knockout doses
of heavy drugs. It's not healthy.

47:41.678 --> 47:44.620
No, well. Nothing we
can do about that.

47:45.057 --> 47:48.046
What else are you having
trouble remembering?

47:49.269 --> 47:51.422
The override code for the weapons?
In case Leonid...

47:51.522 --> 47:53.633
Override 4754.

47:53.774 --> 47:55.676
Your birthday?

47:55.776 --> 47:59.311
4th month 2nd day. One day
too late, you always said.

48:01.115 --> 48:02.558
Yes. Yes.

48:02.658 --> 48:04.143
The name of our dog?

48:04.243 --> 48:05.975
Alpha.

48:06.286 --> 48:09.064
This is serious.
We should get you a scan.

48:09.164 --> 48:11.817
Yes, but one more thing.

48:11.917 --> 48:15.696
I'm having trouble remembering where...
Where we placed the boy.

48:15.796 --> 48:17.031
I'm sure it's temporary, but I...

48:17.131 --> 48:18.699
Yeah.

48:18.799 --> 48:21.242
- I'm sure it will come back.
- Even so.

48:23.095 --> 48:25.456
I'd like to write it down.

48:26.932 --> 48:28.462
<i>Image sized.</i>

48:29.393 --> 48:32.334
Since when are you right handed?

48:34.481 --> 48:36.556
You learned to catch
the ball didn't you?

49:02.134 --> 49:03.744
<i>Shutting down.</i>

49:03.844 --> 49:06.667
Hey! Hey!

49:08.724 --> 49:09.708
I need you to help me...

49:09.808 --> 49:10.834
Sir, we need you to
calm down, all right?

49:10.934 --> 49:11.919
Step back, sir!

49:12.019 --> 49:13.587
- I kidnapped a boy.
- Scan.

49:13.687 --> 49:15.680
<i>Scanning in progress.</i>

49:16.940 --> 49:17.966
- Unarmed.
- Listen to me.

49:18.066 --> 49:20.803
Do not put your hands on us!
You need to calm down and step back!

49:20.903 --> 49:23.263
Step back and calm down.
Otherwise, you'll be arrested.

49:23.363 --> 49:25.605
- Arrest me! Arrest me!
- Sir, calm down.

49:25.866 --> 49:29.317
Hey! Get on the floor with your
hands behind your head, now!

49:29.870 --> 49:31.898
Shots fired! Freeze.

49:35.793 --> 49:37.986
What are you going
to do now? Shoot me?

49:38.337 --> 49:41.410
You need me alive, don't you?
What about you?

49:45.302 --> 49:46.951
Ryan.

49:51.016 --> 49:52.751
Just gimme the code. Gimme the code.

49:52.851 --> 49:56.880
Authorize Sanchez 73763.

49:56.980 --> 49:58.465
Authorize 73763.

49:58.565 --> 50:00.593
<i>Initialized.</i>

50:05.864 --> 50:07.939
Dana, what are you doing here?

50:08.450 --> 50:09.935
You're working with them, aren't you?

50:10.035 --> 50:11.478
Where's the kid? Where's Alex?

50:11.578 --> 50:12.938
I'm sorry.

50:13.038 --> 50:15.113
Sorry for what?

50:41.066 --> 50:43.677
Sergio wants you to know that
you have been kidnapped.

50:43.777 --> 50:47.389
After the amount of money you
guys paid last time to be let go,

50:47.489 --> 50:51.477
he feels that, as you are rich,
a criminal and valuable to your friend,

50:51.577 --> 50:54.518
that you are the perfect specimen.

50:55.122 --> 50:56.817
Also.

50:57.124 --> 50:59.282
I don't like you.

51:15.225 --> 51:17.218
It's all there.

51:18.979 --> 51:20.758
Trust me.

51:25.444 --> 51:26.637
Why don't you relax, huh?

51:26.737 --> 51:27.888
I've come a long way.

51:27.988 --> 51:30.728
Why don't you shut your fucking
mouth and finish counting?

51:40.793 --> 51:43.570
He would like me to remind you
that this wouldn't have happened

51:43.670 --> 51:46.240
if your friend hadn't tried
to steal his property.

51:46.340 --> 51:48.119
By which he means me.

51:50.177 --> 51:51.825
Okay.

52:06.902 --> 52:08.432
Come on.

52:09.029 --> 52:10.808
Okay?

52:14.326 --> 52:16.270
I wonder, after receiving
all that you just did,

52:16.370 --> 52:20.065
if you wouldn't mind letting
my friend take the girl.

52:20.165 --> 52:22.941
We'll dispose of her when we're done.

52:25.045 --> 52:28.035
<i>Niet</i>. Get out.

52:28.924 --> 52:30.917
Come on, let's go.

52:43.397 --> 52:45.257
We should move very quickly, Father.

52:45.357 --> 52:47.509
I've arranged a little
surprise for them.

52:47.609 --> 52:51.393
She really does resemble Mom.
I know why you like that girl.

53:03.417 --> 53:04.947
Go!

53:09.089 --> 53:12.244
Don't be stupid, Ryan.
Don't make me shoot you.

53:34.239 --> 53:35.332
Hey!

53:49.588 --> 53:51.450
God damn it!

53:59.807 --> 54:01.835
Remember me, Ryan.

54:02.309 --> 54:03.839
Come on, we're leaving.

54:08.232 --> 54:09.258
Come on, let's go.

54:09.358 --> 54:10.718
<i>Thank you for your custom.</i>

54:10.818 --> 54:14.388
<i>House rules state that only one
customer may leave at any time.</i>

54:14.488 --> 54:16.765
<i>This door will now
lock for two minutes.</i>

54:16.865 --> 54:19.310
<i>View our selection of
girls in front of you.</i>

54:19.410 --> 54:21.562
<i>Book your favorite by
scheduling an outcall</i>

54:21.662 --> 54:24.271
<i>and have all your dreams come true.</i>

54:24.498 --> 54:28.235
<i>Plan your next visit. Try one
of our many hot tub rooms.</i>

54:28.335 --> 54:30.447
<i>Join our executive date...</i>

56:38.632 --> 56:40.162
Hey, I want a refund!

58:10.224 --> 58:11.458
Dana, it's me Ryan.

58:11.558 --> 58:15.592
You used to work as a nurse.
Your son's name is Eden.

58:20.734 --> 58:22.344
- What do I do?
- Shut up!

58:22.444 --> 58:25.139
Say, override 4754.

58:25.239 --> 58:27.148
Override 4754.

58:27.950 --> 58:29.143
0204.

58:29.243 --> 58:30.856
Override 0204.

58:31.578 --> 58:32.646
Didn't work.

58:32.746 --> 58:34.311
You die, you fool.

58:34.790 --> 58:36.191
Fool! One day too late.

58:36.291 --> 58:38.277
Say 0104. 0104.

58:38.377 --> 58:40.487
Override 0104.

59:01.942 --> 59:04.011
Hey! It's okay. It's okay.
Hey! It's okay.

59:04.111 --> 59:05.596
I'm sorry, he made me help him.

59:05.696 --> 59:07.181
He said that he would
kill me. I'm so sorry.

59:07.281 --> 59:09.475
Everything's gonna be okay,
we need to get out of here, now.

59:09.575 --> 59:11.816
Which way do we go?

59:43.609 --> 59:45.138
Jump.

59:48.655 --> 59:50.767
Here, take this.

59:51.658 --> 59:54.520
Wherever I've spent the most time,
that's where the boy will be.

59:54.620 --> 59:55.813
You need to start there.

59:55.913 --> 59:57.608
I don't know where you've been.

59:58.248 --> 01:00:00.901
Look, he pushed me out of the van.
He forced me to do that,

01:00:01.001 --> 01:00:02.069
and then he pulled me back in again.

01:00:02.169 --> 01:00:04.196
He only took me with him
that last time as bait.

01:00:04.296 --> 01:00:06.281
I'm sorry. I don't
know where that is.

01:00:06.381 --> 01:00:10.619
Okay, when I change you follow me,
you watch me, you bring the police.

01:00:10.719 --> 01:00:12.037
I can't do that.

01:00:12.137 --> 01:00:14.248
Then you need to get as far
away from me as possible.

01:00:14.348 --> 01:00:18.500
Because if I see you again,
I will kill you. So, just go.

01:00:23.482 --> 01:00:25.175
The boy that you're helping.

01:00:25.275 --> 01:00:26.840
Is he your son?

01:00:29.113 --> 01:00:31.098
Why do you care so much?

01:00:31.198 --> 01:00:33.273
What else do I have?

01:00:41.583 --> 01:00:42.901
- Get the girl.
- Move. Move. Go!

01:00:43.001 --> 01:00:44.278
Freeze! NYPD.

01:00:44.378 --> 01:00:46.572
Stand right where you are.

01:00:46.672 --> 01:00:47.865
Get the girl now.

01:00:47.965 --> 01:00:50.325
- Hands down.
- Come here.

01:00:52.386 --> 01:00:53.912
You have the right to remain silent.

01:00:54.012 --> 01:00:57.374
Anything you say can and will be
used against you in a court of law.

01:00:57.474 --> 01:00:58.751
You have a right to an attorney.

01:00:58.851 --> 01:01:01.837
If you cannot afford an attorney,
one will be provided for you.

01:01:01.937 --> 01:01:04.465
Do you understand these rights...

01:01:04.565 --> 01:01:09.136
<i>six terrorist, seven terrorist, eight
terrorist, nine terrorist, 10 terrorist.</i>

01:01:09.236 --> 01:01:10.471
Let's go again.

01:01:10.571 --> 01:01:14.975
One terrorist, two terrorist, three
terrorist, four terrorist, five terrorist,

01:01:15.075 --> 01:01:19.438
six terrorist, seven terrorist, eight
terrorist, nine terrorist, 10 terrorist.

01:01:19.538 --> 01:01:21.780
Fuck it, eleven terrorist.

01:01:26.211 --> 01:01:29.117
Won't ask you again. Where's Leonid?

01:01:29.298 --> 01:01:30.991
In a secret lab. Making a virus.

01:01:31.091 --> 01:01:33.250
Finally. Where?

01:01:33.886 --> 01:01:37.581
I want to tell you, but I'm being
controlled by Dr. Francis Langham.

01:01:37.681 --> 01:01:39.500
I've have, like, a modem inside me.

01:01:39.600 --> 01:01:42.544
Sometimes the signal goes
down, and I'm myself again.

01:01:42.644 --> 01:01:44.969
It's called droning.

01:01:49.151 --> 01:01:53.101
Now, we have procedures we
have to follow, as you know.

01:01:53.864 --> 01:01:55.849
Always have a medic
present during waterings,

01:01:55.949 --> 01:01:58.807
wait five minutes between
bouts, all that shit.

01:01:59.203 --> 01:02:03.817
The thing is, this flight.
It doesn't exist.

01:02:04.166 --> 01:02:07.820
So the rule book goes out
of the fucking window.

01:02:11.548 --> 01:02:13.161
Wait!

01:02:15.594 --> 01:02:17.413
Let's say I give the
benefit of the doubt.

01:02:17.513 --> 01:02:19.837
I'm gonna try and reason with you.

01:02:25.062 --> 01:02:27.339
Look at this shit.

01:02:28.482 --> 01:02:31.803
And this, and this.

01:02:32.611 --> 01:02:36.181
Leonid, the guy you're covering for,

01:02:36.281 --> 01:02:39.268
has worked out how to do
something that no one else can.

01:02:39.368 --> 01:02:43.230
There are guys who know how to
genetically code and engineer a virus.

01:02:43.330 --> 01:02:47.318
We've been doing it ever since we
grew an ear on a mouse decades ago,

01:02:47.418 --> 01:02:50.362
but Leonid's are something special.

01:02:50.462 --> 01:02:52.906
His viruses fuck with your DNA.

01:02:53.006 --> 01:02:54.950
This one was his first success.

01:02:55.050 --> 01:02:58.704
Made you grow extra lungs.
Only they wouldn't stop growing.

01:02:58.804 --> 01:03:00.581
To stop it going global we
had to scorch the earth

01:03:00.681 --> 01:03:02.750
for 100 miles around his lab.

01:03:02.850 --> 01:03:05.627
Now, Leonid out,
cooking up viruses in a lab?

01:03:05.727 --> 01:03:07.755
That's a very bad idea.

01:03:07.855 --> 01:03:10.215
So, where the fuck is
this dangerous asshole?

01:03:10.315 --> 01:03:12.134
I don't know. I'm being controlled.

01:03:12.234 --> 01:03:15.685
You need to speak to
Dr. Francis Langham.

01:03:18.824 --> 01:03:21.018
- LSR Bioware?
- Yes.

01:03:21.452 --> 01:03:23.062
Him and his son,
they made me kidnap a kid.

01:03:23.162 --> 01:03:25.439
He and his son killed themselves
when their company went down.

01:03:25.539 --> 01:03:27.775
They faked it. He's controlling me.

01:03:27.875 --> 01:03:29.689
Bullshit.

01:03:31.754 --> 01:03:33.995
This is your last chance.

01:03:34.423 --> 01:03:39.085
I'm old school, my dad was
old school. Served 50 years.

01:03:39.511 --> 01:03:44.043
I like old school things.
Cars, records,

01:03:44.349 --> 01:03:45.998
guns.

01:03:46.185 --> 01:03:48.045
No codes, just odds.

01:03:48.145 --> 01:03:50.220
Right now it's one in six.

01:03:50.522 --> 01:03:53.425
- Where's the lab?
- I don't know. Oh, God!

01:03:53.525 --> 01:03:54.802
I'd advise you to start talking.

01:03:54.902 --> 01:03:57.346
Who's in charge of the operation?
Who are you?

01:03:57.446 --> 01:03:59.390
I don't know! Please.

01:03:59.490 --> 01:04:01.897
Four. It's exciting, isn't it?

01:04:02.242 --> 01:04:04.103
You sure you don't want to
tell us where the lab is?

01:04:04.203 --> 01:04:05.270
I'm sorry.

01:04:05.370 --> 01:04:07.856
- Please! I just wanna save the kid.
- What's the plan?

01:04:07.956 --> 01:04:09.608
What virus is Leonid making?

01:04:09.708 --> 01:04:11.701
I don't know...

01:04:14.254 --> 01:04:16.329
It's the organ!

01:04:17.716 --> 01:04:20.452
It's the organ he's
controlling me with.

01:04:20.552 --> 01:04:22.788
It's bioware. He's made it smaller.

01:04:22.888 --> 01:04:24.999
Nano, pico,
Leonid's virus will carry it.

01:04:25.099 --> 01:04:29.214
Everyone infected will grow
a place the tech can sit.

01:04:29.394 --> 01:04:34.090
This thing that they've done to me,
they're gonna do it to everyone!

01:04:34.733 --> 01:04:37.591
He wants to control everyone!

01:04:37.820 --> 01:04:39.263
I'm just gonna shoot him!

01:04:39.363 --> 01:04:42.601
Please! Please! You have to
believe me, please. Please.

01:04:43.826 --> 01:04:45.644
He's either crazy or
he's telling the truth.

01:04:45.744 --> 01:04:47.855
Yeah, I say crazy.

01:04:47.955 --> 01:04:50.647
I've seen worse though. Korea.

01:04:50.749 --> 01:04:52.985
There's this guy who
thought he was the devil.

01:04:53.085 --> 01:04:54.778
Another guy thought he was God.

01:04:54.878 --> 01:04:57.823
Just to see what would happen,
we put 'em in a cell together.

01:04:57.923 --> 01:05:01.410
Straight off, they started whaling
on each other. Real dirty.

01:05:01.510 --> 01:05:04.001
- Who won?
- It was even.

01:05:06.265 --> 01:05:08.423
But the devil had the better moves.

01:05:11.228 --> 01:05:15.047
Hey. Hey, is that plane following us?

01:05:15.441 --> 01:05:17.884
Shit, it's firing something.

01:05:46.638 --> 01:05:50.125
Is that you, Ryan? Back again?

01:05:50.601 --> 01:05:51.877
Hmm?

01:05:51.977 --> 01:05:53.671
What do you think
about this arrangement?

01:05:53.771 --> 01:05:57.257
No more dealing with inflatable
balls and knockout drugs.

01:05:57.357 --> 01:06:01.261
All the tech in the world and the
best thing is to simply tie you up.

01:06:01.361 --> 01:06:02.554
It's me, son.

01:06:02.654 --> 01:06:04.515
- Really.
- Yes.

01:06:04.615 --> 01:06:09.645
I'm trying to imagine what it will
be like to control anyone I choose.

01:06:09.828 --> 01:06:12.314
The prospect makes me quite giddy.

01:06:12.414 --> 01:06:14.110
Me, too.

01:06:14.541 --> 01:06:18.362
We'll be more efficient and powerful
than any government in the world.

01:06:18.921 --> 01:06:20.197
A few necessary sacrifices,

01:06:20.297 --> 01:06:23.575
and people will not only want
control, they'll demand it.

01:06:23.675 --> 01:06:27.578
Leonid wants to see his kid free.
Delivery is in a few days.

01:06:28.347 --> 01:06:31.500
I would like to stretch my legs, son.

01:06:31.600 --> 01:06:34.628
This? I might as well
be back in the chair.

01:06:34.728 --> 01:06:36.880
We can't let that happen.

01:06:36.980 --> 01:06:39.675
You should have been chained the
moment the fugues started, Father.

01:06:39.775 --> 01:06:41.844
Ryan nearly destroyed
the whole project.

01:06:41.944 --> 01:06:43.304
The solar flares are settling,

01:06:43.404 --> 01:06:45.723
and they will no longer be
effecting the satellite's signal.

01:06:45.823 --> 01:06:47.933
One, maybe two episodes at most.

01:06:48.033 --> 01:06:49.768
So you gave the
satellite a high orbit.

01:06:49.868 --> 01:06:52.730
I didn't know solar storms were going
to interfere with the satellite.

01:06:52.830 --> 01:06:54.231
It's an 11-year cycle. This size?

01:06:54.331 --> 01:06:55.649
It's once every thousand years.

01:06:55.749 --> 01:06:57.484
- How am I...
- You should've checked all eventualities.

01:06:57.584 --> 01:07:01.697
I did. I've sacrificed so much.
I have worked so hard.

01:07:01.797 --> 01:07:06.281
You demanded obedience, and I
obeyed and succeeded, despite this.

01:07:09.430 --> 01:07:11.165
You're right.

01:07:11.265 --> 01:07:14.251
Your behavior these last few
months has impressed me.

01:07:14.351 --> 01:07:15.586
Thank you.

01:07:15.686 --> 01:07:20.846
I may not often say, but I
am proud to be your father.

01:07:24.069 --> 01:07:26.181
Embrace me, son!

01:08:35.349 --> 01:08:36.997
Ryan.

01:08:40.354 --> 01:08:42.511
Clever, I admit.

01:08:46.193 --> 01:08:47.761
But what now?

01:08:47.861 --> 01:08:49.305
Save that kid?

01:08:49.404 --> 01:08:52.310
From out here, the middle of nowhere?

01:08:52.741 --> 01:08:55.765
In the amount of time
that you have left?

01:08:56.120 --> 01:08:59.144
I don't see that happening, do you?

01:08:59.540 --> 01:09:04.319
Just enjoy the sun on
your skin, breeze in your face.

01:09:06.380 --> 01:09:08.703
Bird singing.

01:09:11.885 --> 01:09:15.171
I have a suggestion.
Let's have a drink.

01:09:15.680 --> 01:09:20.129
I'll show you a picture of your wife.
You remember her, don't you?

01:09:29.319 --> 01:09:31.051
Come.

01:09:39.787 --> 01:09:41.733
Have a seat.

01:09:44.042 --> 01:09:46.533
I get it Ryan. I do.

01:09:48.046 --> 01:09:49.990
Did I ever tell you about my mom?

01:09:50.090 --> 01:09:52.785
She was 35. She was killed
along with 26 other people

01:09:52.885 --> 01:09:58.165
by a solo crazed gunman who
didn't wanna pay taxes anymore.

01:09:58.265 --> 01:10:00.377
Now, how is that fair?

01:10:00.559 --> 01:10:02.294
He did the wrong thing.

01:10:02.394 --> 01:10:05.003
I'm doing the right thing.

01:10:08.650 --> 01:10:12.262
Just like your wife.
She's gone. Move on.

01:10:12.362 --> 01:10:15.849
Don't spend the few remaining
fragments of your life suffering.

01:10:16.575 --> 01:10:18.437
Enjoy them.

01:10:18.577 --> 01:10:21.605
To living every moment
as if it were your last.

01:10:21.705 --> 01:10:23.235
You're right.

01:10:24.917 --> 01:10:27.194
So now I know what I need to do.

01:10:41.767 --> 01:10:43.712
What's the point?

01:11:45.164 --> 01:11:48.615
You don't wanna do that.
You'll kill us both.

01:13:24.096 --> 01:13:26.206
You followed me.

01:13:26.306 --> 01:13:28.584
Following, watching,
everywhere just like you asked.

01:13:28.684 --> 01:13:31.253
I used the money you
left me and the truth is,

01:13:31.353 --> 01:13:33.839
<i>no one's been as good to me as you.</i>

01:13:33.939 --> 01:13:35.674
Ever.

01:13:35.774 --> 01:13:37.968
There isn't anytime.

01:13:39.153 --> 01:13:42.308
So you might as well just let me die.

01:13:42.489 --> 01:13:45.644
Will you, Ryan, come back again?

01:13:47.619 --> 01:13:49.688
Maybe once or twice.

01:13:49.788 --> 01:13:52.315
That's enough to save the boy.

01:13:54.084 --> 01:13:56.695
We both have lost people
that we care about.

01:13:56.795 --> 01:13:59.452
We shouldn't lose this kid.

01:14:01.592 --> 01:14:03.584
Put these on before you change.

01:14:11.351 --> 01:14:13.510
Why are you really helping me?

01:14:14.313 --> 01:14:16.590
What else do I have?

01:14:27.734 --> 01:14:29.556
Hey!

01:14:53.852 --> 01:14:56.213
Reply, Eden.

01:15:06.365 --> 01:15:08.357
Right answer, hero.

01:15:09.284 --> 01:15:11.063
- How long?
- Three days.

01:15:13.747 --> 01:15:16.108
We're not far,
but we haven't much time.

01:15:16.208 --> 01:15:17.985
The other guy's been looking.

01:15:18.085 --> 01:15:19.862
Ten minutes till you
change back, right?

01:15:19.962 --> 01:15:22.204
Yeah.

01:15:26.718 --> 01:15:28.414
Here you go.

01:15:29.430 --> 01:15:31.754
All right. Let's roll.

01:15:50.951 --> 01:15:53.771
This is where it's all going down.
Whatever it is.

01:15:53.871 --> 01:15:55.685
Hibiscus.

01:15:55.914 --> 01:15:59.449
I started a countdown.
So you'll know.

01:16:02.087 --> 01:16:06.832
Okay, I need you to listen to me.
You need to run now.

01:16:07.259 --> 01:16:09.119
'Cause if you see me again,
it won't be me.

01:16:09.219 --> 01:16:10.162
- Do you understand?
- No.

01:16:10.262 --> 01:16:11.288
- Yes. Yes.
- No!

01:16:11.388 --> 01:16:14.621
- Listen, I'm trying to save your life.
- No. No.

01:16:25.861 --> 01:16:28.222
<i>Welcome, Dr. Langham.</i>

01:17:37.599 --> 01:17:42.261
<i>I've made your virus,
integrated the biotechnology.</i>

01:17:43.272 --> 01:17:47.424
<i>Now let my son go,
you bastards. Let him go!</i>

01:17:48.402 --> 01:17:50.726
<i>I'll have to test it.</i>

01:18:27.649 --> 01:18:30.970
- They killed Leonid...
- Drop the gun, Ryan.

01:18:34.073 --> 01:18:35.307
Dr. Langham.

01:18:35.407 --> 01:18:37.269
Yes!

01:18:40.120 --> 01:18:43.607
Drop the gun or the boy dies.

01:18:49.755 --> 01:18:51.740
We took this subject
to test the new virus

01:18:51.840 --> 01:18:53.784
when we rescued you from the plane.

01:18:53.884 --> 01:18:55.828
Or me, I should say.

01:18:55.928 --> 01:18:59.581
Less than a day, the body
assimilates imbedded picotech.

01:18:59.681 --> 01:19:01.125
Subject's online in two.

01:19:01.225 --> 01:19:04.961
New population-control
satellite's been launched.

01:19:06.271 --> 01:19:09.341
You're looking at the
first of the new breed.

01:19:09.441 --> 01:19:10.968
I thought I was the first.

01:19:11.068 --> 01:19:12.800
Third actually.

01:19:13.070 --> 01:19:15.222
An expendable prototype.

01:19:15.322 --> 01:19:18.017
All I have to do is walk out there,

01:19:18.117 --> 01:19:21.020
and within days,
without them realizing it,

01:19:21.120 --> 01:19:23.939
people will be ready
to be controlled.

01:19:24.039 --> 01:19:26.692
Ready to be given purpose,
my dear boy.

01:19:26.792 --> 01:19:28.152
What do you plan to do with me?

01:19:28.252 --> 01:19:29.778
Nothing.

01:19:29.878 --> 01:19:32.823
Your satellite will be back
online in a few moments.

01:19:32.923 --> 01:19:35.699
I may just push white noise
through your signal,

01:19:35.968 --> 01:19:39.668
keep you around like my
favorite old pair of slippers.

01:19:43.308 --> 01:19:45.794
You won't be coming back again, Ryan.

01:19:45.894 --> 01:19:48.088
Any last requests?

01:19:48.981 --> 01:19:51.175
A drink.

01:20:00.242 --> 01:20:02.934
I do have one more question.

01:20:05.998 --> 01:20:07.563
Why?

01:20:10.294 --> 01:20:13.319
You know how you control the masses?

01:20:16.216 --> 01:20:17.829
Fear.

01:20:18.927 --> 01:20:21.080
Humanity does appalling things.

01:20:21.180 --> 01:20:24.086
Some of them, I've experienced.

01:20:24.808 --> 01:20:28.544
We saw so many tragic cases
come through the unit.

01:20:28.645 --> 01:20:30.798
It was sickening.

01:20:30.898 --> 01:20:34.219
War. War. War.

01:20:35.402 --> 01:20:39.186
Endless fighting and dying,
and dying and fighting.

01:20:39.656 --> 01:20:41.981
But in the world that I create,

01:20:42.201 --> 01:20:46.316
if you break my laws,
you will simply be switched off.

01:20:46.622 --> 01:20:48.982
Your signal overtaken.

01:20:50.167 --> 01:20:53.654
And that fear will create
a beautiful future.

01:20:53.921 --> 01:20:56.032
A world without conflict.

01:20:56.173 --> 01:20:57.324
- A world of harmony.
- Harmony.

01:20:57.424 --> 01:20:59.203
Exactly!

01:21:00.302 --> 01:21:01.996
So why do you wish to stop me?

01:21:02.096 --> 01:21:04.206
Because I want my life back
and you don't have the right.

01:21:04.306 --> 01:21:07.627
Not only do I have the right.
It's my duty.

01:21:08.435 --> 01:21:13.548
Your life. You have no life.
I've been your life!

01:21:15.109 --> 01:21:19.221
I took you because you ended yours
when you allowed your wife to die,

01:21:19.321 --> 01:21:22.346
because you couldn't make a choice.

01:21:24.118 --> 01:21:27.854
It's important what you
read last thing at night.

01:21:29.498 --> 01:21:32.321
It sets the tone of your sleep.

01:21:33.460 --> 01:21:35.946
That was one of the many
things you taught me.

01:21:36.046 --> 01:21:39.201
I learnt so much from you.
So, so much.

01:21:39.675 --> 01:21:41.994
Things I'd never
even heard of before.

01:21:42.094 --> 01:21:44.086
Like valencies,

01:21:44.430 --> 01:21:48.545
isomers and chemical reactions.

01:22:41.570 --> 01:22:42.638
Did you meet him?

01:22:42.738 --> 01:22:44.303
He's dead.

01:22:45.115 --> 01:22:46.680
Doesn't matter.

01:22:47.409 --> 01:22:49.484
How about this beautiful
creature next?

01:22:52.122 --> 01:22:54.525
You're fond of her aren't you?

01:22:54.625 --> 01:22:59.867
My dad likes her, too.
My mother had more class.

01:23:00.589 --> 01:23:02.534
But this isn't just for her.

01:23:03.383 --> 01:23:06.662
We need a new world and this is it.

01:23:06.762 --> 01:23:09.873
- Your dad's plan won't work, Harkin.
- I agree.

01:23:09.973 --> 01:23:13.419
My father's an idealist,
it doesn't mean he's wrong.

01:23:13.519 --> 01:23:16.757
You see, I put a little
more thought into it.

01:23:17.439 --> 01:23:21.468
There are no good guys and
bad guys, Ryan. Just opinions.

01:23:21.568 --> 01:23:26.015
But you know the right way to get
one individual controlling everyone?

01:23:26.115 --> 01:23:29.435
By having me controlling
the right individual.

01:23:29.535 --> 01:23:34.231
For example, let's just say a
particularly unstable world leader.

01:23:34.331 --> 01:23:39.361
Control's inevitable in some form,
whether it's us or not.

01:23:40.754 --> 01:23:43.073
But this being airborne,
people are gonna purge their systems.

01:23:43.173 --> 01:23:45.743
They're gonna mimic the tech,
they're gonna destroy the satellites.

01:23:45.843 --> 01:23:47.745
I know that.

01:23:47.845 --> 01:23:50.706
But me having the right person,

01:23:50.806 --> 01:23:53.792
doing the right thing to ensure
that this planet has a future.

01:23:53.892 --> 01:23:56.964
Now that makes sense, Ryan.

01:23:57.855 --> 01:24:00.381
That's how I'll remake the world.

01:24:02.025 --> 01:24:04.552
There's absolutely no
reason to stop me.

01:24:08.866 --> 01:24:11.101
You don't give up,
I infect her, we win.

01:24:11.201 --> 01:24:13.771
You shoot me, this falls,
it goes airborne, we win.

01:24:13.871 --> 01:24:16.896
You do nothing, you time out, I win.

01:24:17.040 --> 01:24:19.943
This is not a situation that
you can shoot yourself out of.

01:24:20.043 --> 01:24:22.072
I guess not.

01:24:22.254 --> 01:24:27.165
All this for a kid? You've caused
me so many problems, Ryan.

01:24:27.843 --> 01:24:30.537
So, I'm gonna let you watch me
inject her before you time out.

01:24:30.637 --> 01:24:33.499
Admittedly, it'll be a little
different for my father.

01:24:33.599 --> 01:24:37.127
Let's just see if he likes
being inside her once again.

01:24:37.227 --> 01:24:38.671
Something for him to toy around with

01:24:38.771 --> 01:24:41.674
before he ultimately realizes
that he's not needed anymore.

01:24:41.774 --> 01:24:43.050
She doesn't deserve that.

01:24:43.150 --> 01:24:44.551
Oh, I know that.

01:24:44.651 --> 01:24:48.767
But we should always try and do
what's right for our family, Ryan.

01:24:49.031 --> 01:24:51.474
You of all people should know that.

01:24:54.912 --> 01:24:56.441
Missed.

01:26:07.151 --> 01:26:09.179
Let's see how you like it!

01:26:11.321 --> 01:26:13.930
Hey, whore, say goodbye...

01:26:50.277 --> 01:26:54.227
Hey, Ryan. Come on. Come on up.

01:26:55.908 --> 01:26:59.857
You okay? Here. Here.

01:27:07.127 --> 01:27:08.821
His name's Alex.

01:27:08.921 --> 01:27:12.740
I want you to look after
him as if he were your own.

01:27:16.512 --> 01:27:18.622
Thank you so much.

01:27:18.722 --> 01:27:20.833
No! You don't have to do this.

01:27:20.933 --> 01:27:23.340
If I don't do it,
I'm gonna change back.

01:27:23.811 --> 01:27:26.337
Please! Please!

01:27:31.235 --> 01:27:33.310
- I'm sorry.
- No!

01:28:00.806 --> 01:28:02.620
Time's up!

01:28:18.449 --> 01:28:21.818
You okay? I got you.
Hang on. It's okay.

01:28:22.786 --> 01:28:24.980
Hang on a second.

01:28:27.666 --> 01:28:29.659
Ryan?

01:29:34.983 --> 01:29:38.684
Hey, it's me.
It's okay now, it's over!

01:29:40.364 --> 01:29:42.606
Harkin and Langham?

01:29:42.741 --> 01:29:44.734
They're dead.

01:29:51.959 --> 01:29:57.735
Look, I couldn't risk anyone else
tuning in, so I cut them out.

01:30:10.727 --> 01:30:11.920
Where are we?

01:30:12.020 --> 01:30:13.669
Home.

01:30:14.523 --> 01:30:16.171
Look.

01:30:33.917 --> 01:30:36.779
I tried explaining to
him as best I could.

01:30:36.879 --> 01:30:41.280
It'll still probably take him a
little time to get used to you.

01:30:41.884 --> 01:30:43.995
He's a good kid.

01:30:44.762 --> 01:30:50.289
I was thinking that maybe we could
all hang until we figure things out.

01:31:06.950 --> 01:31:08.480
Mmm.

01:31:11.872 --> 01:31:16.569
Baby, that was no minor surgery.
You need to rest.

01:31:20.923 --> 01:31:22.998
I have an idea.

01:31:29.723 --> 01:31:31.882
You take control.

01:31:42.627 --> 01:31:45.461
<i>...hang tight. We're live in five.</i>

01:31:47.825 --> 01:31:49.520
Ryan?

01:31:50.160 --> 01:31:51.809
Ryan?

01:31:52.305 --> 01:31:58.436
