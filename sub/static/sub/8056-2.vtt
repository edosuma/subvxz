WEBVTT

00:01.401 --> 00:04.006
Okay, guys. The Battle
Royale is coming up.

00:04.070 --> 00:07.210
Every department in one room,
arguing for more money.

00:07.407 --> 00:09.648
Budgetary Thunderdome.

00:09.709 --> 00:13.088
So, uh, make lists of why
other departments suck,

00:13.146 --> 00:14.989
and I'm going to go
get the secret weapon.

00:15.048 --> 00:17.790
Our secret weapon in
this budgetary battle?

00:17.851 --> 00:19.091
Ron.

00:19.152 --> 00:21.359
Every time another department
asks for more money,

00:21.421 --> 00:24.959
he just stares them down until they
back off and, or, wet themselves.

00:26.926 --> 00:29.031
Hey! Who's ready to get...

00:30.196 --> 00:31.266
What are you doing?

00:31.398 --> 00:33.002
Tammy One showed up.

00:33.633 --> 00:36.136
I'm being audited
by the IRS.

00:36.202 --> 00:38.808
No. Your worst nightmare.

00:39.005 --> 00:40.507
You know what? Screw this.

00:40.573 --> 00:42.985
First of all,
income tax is illegal.

00:43.676 --> 00:46.520
Second, Tammy is
a psychological mastermind.

00:46.579 --> 00:50.618
This is just another way for her
to put her hand up my keister

00:50.683 --> 00:52.287
and control me like a puppet.

00:53.086 --> 00:54.394
I'd rather be locked up.

00:54.788 --> 00:58.361
Ron, this is a federal tax audit.
You could go to jail.

00:58.425 --> 01:01.429
Jail, Ron. Ron, jail.
Jail, Ron. Jail.

01:01.895 --> 01:04.340
You could go to jail
Jail. Jail. Jail.

01:04.397 --> 01:05.967
- Are you broken?
- Andy! April!

01:06.800 --> 01:08.711
What's up, boss? Stop
yelling and being annoying.

01:08.768 --> 01:10.577
Grab your calculators,
settle in.

01:11.571 --> 01:14.552
Operation Rescue Ron
is starting.

01:14.607 --> 01:16.712
Don't worry. I will think of a
better name for it by tomorrow.

01:16.776 --> 01:18.380
Here you go.
Calculator.

01:20.000 --> 01:26.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:40.166 --> 01:41.702
Hey! Ben!
Hey, man.

01:41.768 --> 01:43.839
Hey, thanks for
texting me to hang out.

01:44.170 --> 01:47.208
I really felt like we'd developed
a cool friendship, and it...

01:47.273 --> 01:48.547
Anyway, it was just nice
to have that validated.

01:48.608 --> 01:49.609
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah.

01:49.676 --> 01:52.623
Look. We've got some documents
over at Entertainment 720

01:52.679 --> 01:54.124
that seem really complicated.

01:54.180 --> 01:55.818
And I thought maybe you could
take a look at them,

01:55.882 --> 01:59.295
because nerd stuff
probably really excites you.

02:00.019 --> 02:01.089
Because you're a nerd.

02:01.154 --> 02:04.328
No, of course. Yeah, no. I'll
just put on my Star Wars pajamas

02:04.390 --> 02:06.768
and sit in my mom's basement and
pore over some spreadsheets.

02:06.826 --> 02:08.828
That sounds great.
Yeah. What have you got?

02:08.895 --> 02:11.637
Something called
"break even analysis tables"?

02:11.698 --> 02:14.042
Oh, break evens? Those are really fun.
Yeah, sure, I'll take a look.

02:14.601 --> 02:15.909
Let's hit it.
What do you...

02:15.969 --> 02:17.778
Right now? I have work.

02:18.404 --> 02:20.907
And I thought I had a friend.

02:21.274 --> 02:22.309
All right.

02:22.375 --> 02:24.446
It's almost too easy.

02:24.511 --> 02:26.650
I can hear you.

02:26.746 --> 02:29.352
I know you can, Ben.
That's how easy it is.

02:29.983 --> 02:32.725
So, we need to find proof
of every tax deduction

02:32.785 --> 02:34.696
I've taken
in the last five years.

02:34.854 --> 02:36.731
Ron, most of these
aren't even receipts.

02:36.789 --> 02:39.861
This one says,
"I bought supplies 2007."

02:40.193 --> 02:42.639
You won't find
any bank statements, either.

02:42.695 --> 02:44.174
I've heavily invested in gold,

02:44.230 --> 02:48.144
which I've buried in several
different locations around Pawnee.

02:48.668 --> 02:49.806
Or have I?

02:49.869 --> 02:52.577
What's this?
Some kind of lame drug deal?

02:52.639 --> 02:54.243
That is
a gentleman's agreement.

02:54.474 --> 02:56.147
I made that man
a dining room table

02:56.209 --> 02:59.520
in exchange for 60 feet of
copper pipe and a half pig.

03:00.046 --> 03:02.424
Well, looks like we have
some actual receipts here.

03:02.482 --> 03:05.952
Same amount every month.
140 bucks. What's this?

03:06.019 --> 03:09.660
Every 30 days, I buy shotgun
shells and cigarettes,

03:09.722 --> 03:11.099
and send them home to my mom.

03:12.458 --> 03:14.961
That's so sweet.
Your mom sounds kickass.

03:15.261 --> 03:17.400
My first ex-wife's name
is Tammy.

03:17.463 --> 03:20.933
My second ex-wife's name
is Tammy.

03:21.000 --> 03:23.913
My mom's name is Tamara.

03:26.005 --> 03:27.416
She goes by Tammy.

03:27.941 --> 03:30.581
You can prevent
adult-onset diabetes

03:31.477 --> 03:33.286
by getting an annual check-up,

03:34.080 --> 03:36.390
exercising, praying...

03:36.449 --> 03:37.553
Okay.

03:37.617 --> 03:38.618
Who is that guy?

03:38.685 --> 03:41.564
That is Walt Morphling. He was
the Director of Public Health,

03:41.654 --> 03:44.260
but he had to retire at 46
because he had diabetes.

03:44.557 --> 03:47.538
That is sad, but also,
in this town, understandable.

03:47.894 --> 03:49.202
I would like
to shoot a new PSA.

03:49.262 --> 03:52.175
And I think it would be good to get
someone who's healthy and telegenic,

03:52.232 --> 03:54.109
and I thought that
you would be perfect.

03:56.369 --> 04:00.044
Ann Perkins. I am flattered. And I will do it.
ls there a script, yet?

04:00.473 --> 04:03.682
Uh, no, because you just approved
the idea, like, three seconds ago.

04:03.743 --> 04:06.053
I would like you to write me a
script and get it to me in an hour.

04:06.112 --> 04:08.251
And we should start
thinking about wardrobe.

04:08.314 --> 04:11.921
Casual? Formal?
Semi-formal? Sporty?

04:11.985 --> 04:14.295
Scary? Posh? Baby?
Those are the Spice Girls.

04:14.354 --> 04:16.800
I just got caught up in my own thoughts.
I'm very excited about this.

04:17.089 --> 04:18.797
In terms of shirts,
I can wear white...

04:18.858 --> 04:20.928
Welcome to paradise, my man.

04:20.994 --> 04:22.837
We can chill
over there by the bar.

04:22.895 --> 04:25.068
We've also got basketball,
at any time you want,

04:25.131 --> 04:27.008
with Roy Hibbert
and Detlef Schrempf.

04:27.333 --> 04:29.404
Oh, my God.
That's an actual NBA player.

04:29.569 --> 04:30.809
He plays for the Pacers.

04:30.870 --> 04:31.905
NBA's on strike,

04:31.971 --> 04:35.248
so we got him for only, like,
75% of his original NBA salary.

04:35.675 --> 04:36.847
What up, Roy?

04:36.909 --> 04:39.287
This is all you want me to do?
Play one-on-one with Detlef?

04:39.345 --> 04:41.586
Yes. And keep your mouth shut.

04:42.348 --> 04:44.259
Jean-Ralphio.
Take me there.

04:44.784 --> 04:45.785
Oh!

04:47.654 --> 04:49.691
Boom!

04:49.822 --> 04:50.892
Who are you?

04:50.957 --> 04:52.800
Uh... This is Ben. He's here
to help us with the paperwork.

04:52.859 --> 04:54.395
Ben. Is that your real name?
Yes.

04:54.460 --> 04:55.530
Oh, you could do
better than that.

04:55.595 --> 04:57.939
I'm going to help you out right now.
Your name is Angelo.

04:57.997 --> 05:00.204
Angelo, thank you so much for
coming out Get a thicker tie.

05:00.266 --> 05:02.405
It looks weird on you. Makes
your head look like a fish.

05:02.468 --> 05:04.607
Secondly, I don't know
where the paperwork is,

05:04.671 --> 05:06.548
but when you find it, can
you take care of it for us?

05:06.606 --> 05:09.177
We don't have any pens 'cause we're
afraid it's gonna leak on our shirts.

05:09.242 --> 05:10.482
Lastly, I hate
the name Angelo.

05:10.543 --> 05:11.749
I'm gonna switch
it up for you right now.

05:11.911 --> 05:13.549
Your new nickname is

05:15.114 --> 05:17.890
Jell-O Shot. What do you
think about that, "J-Shot"?

05:18.084 --> 05:19.222
Do we have questions?
Yeah.

05:19.285 --> 05:20.821
Where are we?

05:20.887 --> 05:23.333
All right, Ben. If you need
anything, one of these models

05:23.389 --> 05:25.835
that we pay to hang around
here will grab it for you.

05:25.892 --> 05:28.099
In the meantime, we're going
to be playing video games

05:28.161 --> 05:29.265
and tweeting our high scores.

05:30.163 --> 05:31.369
Hit it!
Um...

05:31.931 --> 05:33.877
Hi. Are you the receptionist?

05:35.201 --> 05:36.874
I guess. I don't really know.

05:37.103 --> 05:40.050
If you don't mind me asking,
how much are they paying you?

05:40.273 --> 05:43.379
A hundred thousand dollars
a year with full medical.

05:44.844 --> 05:49.452
I mean, I would guess they'll be
bankrupt by the end of this sentence.

05:52.085 --> 05:53.155
No, thank you.

05:54.654 --> 05:58.067
Is this true? You only spent $40
on clothes in the past five years?

05:58.691 --> 05:59.761
Sounds about right.

05:59.826 --> 06:02.170
How did you meet Tammy One?

06:02.228 --> 06:04.071
Technically, I've known
her since I was born.

06:04.130 --> 06:06.167
She was a candy striper
at the hospital.

06:06.232 --> 06:07.233
She helped deliver me.

06:07.734 --> 06:09.441
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God.

06:09.502 --> 06:11.140
I grew up in
a very small town.

06:11.204 --> 06:14.742
Six hundred people.
Everybody knew everybody else.

06:14.807 --> 06:16.946
We first took up
together when I was 15.

06:17.176 --> 06:18.348
Awesome.
Oh, my God.

06:18.411 --> 06:19.583
It was a little scandalous,

06:19.645 --> 06:22.854
but everyone feared her, so
they kept their mouths shut.

06:22.915 --> 06:24.519
I don't even know her,
but she's my hero.

06:25.318 --> 06:27.264
Oh, she's no hero, April.

06:27.320 --> 06:28.731
She's a hellacious nightmare.

06:29.422 --> 06:32.460
She did, however,
teach me everything I know.

06:32.525 --> 06:34.562
Sunday school, sex.

06:34.627 --> 06:37.267
She was my math teacher in
middle school and my babysitter,

06:37.330 --> 06:38.502
and she taught drivers ed.

06:38.831 --> 06:39.832
I---

06:42.835 --> 06:44.610
Hello. I don't believe
we've met.

06:44.670 --> 06:46.843
I am Leslie Knope, Deputy...

06:46.906 --> 06:49.853
I don't think it will be necessary for
you to speak again while I'm here.

06:52.545 --> 06:54.547
Why do I only
date brunettes?

06:55.782 --> 06:59.491
You know, sometimes, you eat chicken
and you get food poisoning,

06:59.552 --> 07:02.897
and then even the sight
of chicken makes you sick?

07:02.955 --> 07:05.265
Tammy One is
my blonde chicken.

07:05.925 --> 07:07.996
Good God, Ronald.

07:08.094 --> 07:10.768
This is a much bigger mess
than I imagined.

07:10.830 --> 07:12.104
You'll take
a week off from work.

07:12.165 --> 07:14.076
We'll do a complete overhaul
of your finances.

07:14.133 --> 07:16.477
I'll need access
to all of your accounts.

07:16.536 --> 07:17.742
And your home.

07:19.105 --> 07:20.413
Is that necessary?

07:20.473 --> 07:21.816
Oh, are we playing a game

07:21.874 --> 07:23.444
where everyone says
something stupid?

07:25.778 --> 07:28.691
You. What is your name?

07:28.748 --> 07:31.126
Tim. Tim Buckanowski.

07:31.617 --> 07:32.618
Really?

07:32.685 --> 07:34.255
No. Andy Dwyer.

07:35.021 --> 07:37.524
Andy, you're going
to collect all of this

07:37.590 --> 07:39.263
and you're going
to put it in my car.

07:40.126 --> 07:41.696
Miss Knope.
Yes.

07:41.761 --> 07:44.071
You're going to go to
payroll and get copies

07:44.130 --> 07:46.371
of Ronald's workplace
expense reports.

07:47.733 --> 07:49.576
I'm just wondering
how long that's going to take,

07:49.836 --> 07:52.180
because Ron and I have a very
important meeting together.

07:52.238 --> 07:54.514
It's called the Battle Royale.
It's super fun. Where all...

07:54.574 --> 07:58.351
Oh. You and Ron have
a big meeting, huh?

07:58.411 --> 08:01.017
I'm sure Ron will remember
the meeting fondly

08:01.080 --> 08:05.051
while he makes toilet wine in a
federal prison in Terre Haute.

08:08.020 --> 08:10.557
I'll head down to payroll.

08:10.623 --> 08:13.297
Now. You're not
getting any younger.

08:13.593 --> 08:14.594
Yes, ma'am.

08:16.095 --> 08:18.473
She's the cold,

08:18.531 --> 08:21.944
distant mother I never had.

08:23.336 --> 08:24.337
I love her.

08:30.343 --> 08:31.754
Good morning, everyone.

08:31.811 --> 08:33.448
Good morning, sir.
How can I help you?

08:34.313 --> 08:36.293
Ron. Your mustache fell off.

08:38.351 --> 08:40.763
Leslie, you goofball.

08:40.820 --> 08:43.732
Tammy pointed out that my face looked
better without any hair on it.

08:43.789 --> 08:47.362
And it did collect a lot of food
crumbs, which is very unsanitary.

08:47.527 --> 08:48.528
What?

08:48.594 --> 08:51.040
Hey, Jer. Hump day, am I right, buddy?

08:51.597 --> 08:52.598
What?

08:53.232 --> 08:55.109
What is going on?
Where's Tammy One?

08:55.167 --> 08:57.704
She moved in with me.
She's really helping me out.

08:57.770 --> 09:00.011
Yesterday, she converted
my bank account

09:00.072 --> 09:01.745
into a joint
bank account with her.

09:01.807 --> 09:04.185
Oh. That's great.
And how is that going to help?

09:05.111 --> 09:07.614
Not sure. When she explains
it, it makes total sense.

09:07.680 --> 09:09.751
It is so nice
having her around.

09:10.416 --> 09:12.054
Here's something neat.

09:12.118 --> 09:14.530
Tammy's got me
taking baby aspirin

09:14.587 --> 09:16.965
to lower my risk
of heart disease.

09:17.023 --> 09:21.301
Science is a miracle. Any-hoo,
back to the old grindstone.

09:21.761 --> 09:24.367
These emails aren't going to
send themselves.

09:25.598 --> 09:29.876
Diabetes can't be cured,
but it can be prevented.

09:29.936 --> 09:34.544
Make a choice, make a change, and
together, we can make a difference.

09:35.408 --> 09:36.785
What do you think?
Any notes?

09:36.842 --> 09:40.255
Great. Just as good, if not exactly
the same, as the last one.

09:40.446 --> 09:42.619
In that last one,
I left a nanosecond of a pause

09:42.682 --> 09:44.628
between the words
"together" and "we".

09:44.684 --> 09:46.891
It felt much better, but I'd
love to try another one.

09:46.953 --> 09:49.024
I really think we've got it.

09:49.088 --> 09:52.262
Ann, this is important to me
'cause it's important to you.

09:52.325 --> 09:54.805
I mean, you spent a lot of time
and energy on writing this.

09:54.860 --> 09:56.066
Not really.

09:56.128 --> 09:57.630
So, it needs to be perfect.

09:57.697 --> 10:00.303
So, let's do one more, then
five more, then 20 in a row.

10:01.968 --> 10:03.709
Hey! Look who it is!

10:03.769 --> 10:04.839
Hey, hey!

10:04.904 --> 10:06.383
Tom. Jean-Ralphio.

10:07.807 --> 10:09.616
Professional
basketball players.

10:09.675 --> 10:10.983
'Sup, Jell-O Shot?

10:11.210 --> 10:14.783
Can I ask you guys a question? How
exactly are you making money?

10:14.847 --> 10:15.882
Do you want to know
how we make money?

10:15.948 --> 10:17.188
Do you want to know
how we make money?

10:17.316 --> 10:19.387
By literally printing
our own money.

10:19.452 --> 10:21.557
We bought a printing press.

10:21.687 --> 10:25.726
This prints bills with our faces
and the E 720 logo on them.

10:26.258 --> 10:28.295
We promote the company
by going to clubs

10:28.361 --> 10:30.272
and tossing the bills
in the air and screaming...

10:30.329 --> 10:31.467
Free money!
Free money!

10:31.530 --> 10:34.067
Okay. You can't just
print your own money.

10:34.133 --> 10:36.079
Uh...
This has to stop,

10:36.135 --> 10:38.012
right now.

10:46.278 --> 10:47.723
Aw!

10:48.047 --> 10:49.082
What's the deal, baby?

10:49.148 --> 10:50.149
One second,
you hit the party switch

10:50.216 --> 10:51.422
and the next second,
you're all business.

10:51.484 --> 10:53.122
I need to see
all of your books.

10:53.185 --> 10:56.166
You got it, baby.
Baby! Get him the books.

10:56.222 --> 10:59.135
Oh, Snapple. Are we calling
everybody "baby" now?

10:59.225 --> 11:01.102
Because honestly, I love that.

11:01.260 --> 11:02.933
Are we saying "Snapple" anytime
we think something's dope?

11:02.995 --> 11:04.406
'Cause I love that, baby.

11:04.463 --> 11:06.340
Do you know what I love?

11:06.399 --> 11:07.400
Jell-O Shot!

11:12.905 --> 11:18.184
Jell-O Shot! Jell-O Shot!
Jell-O Shot! Jell-O Shot!

11:18.444 --> 11:20.720
Thank you. We're here
to serve you, friend.

11:20.780 --> 11:23.226
I hope the rest of
your day is cool beans.

11:23.282 --> 11:26.161
Ron. What is this
memo you sent to me?

11:26.218 --> 11:27.856
You're not going to
the Battle Royale?

11:28.154 --> 11:30.361
I have decided not
to attend this year.

11:30.423 --> 11:33.734
Okay. First of all, it's disturbing
that you wrote a memo at all.

11:33.793 --> 11:36.603
But you love arguing
against government spending.

11:36.662 --> 11:37.766
Why do you not
want to do it now?

11:37.830 --> 11:41.073
Leslie, please. The government
knows what it's doing.

11:41.133 --> 11:42.441
I am confident that I...

11:43.969 --> 11:45.573
Ouchie.
You and I are going to lunch.

11:46.205 --> 11:47.775
We have to talk.

11:47.840 --> 11:49.786
Let me just call Tammy first
and get permission.

11:49.842 --> 11:51.344
Oh, come on.

11:52.945 --> 11:57.257
Tammy, I was wondering if I
could go to lunch with Leslie?

11:57.316 --> 11:59.227
Terrific. Bye.

11:59.285 --> 12:00.457
She says I can't go.

12:00.519 --> 12:03.500
You're going to lunch with me.
I say you can go.

12:05.391 --> 12:07.200
Oh, gosh.

12:07.259 --> 12:08.363
I'm really in a pickle now.

12:08.427 --> 12:09.633
Oh, my God.

12:09.695 --> 12:13.438
When Ron falls for Tammy Two he
turns into a demonic sex maniac.

12:13.499 --> 12:16.412
But this? Neutered wimp?
This is worse.

12:16.469 --> 12:18.915
Operation Golden Dove
is in trouble.

12:19.338 --> 12:21.375
Ron, there are some things
I want to speak to you about,

12:21.440 --> 12:23.977
but I'm not quite sure
how to phrase them.

12:24.043 --> 12:25.522
Just blurt them
right out, Leslie.

12:25.745 --> 12:28.351
Anything you say will
stay between you and me.

12:28.414 --> 12:29.688
Right, my love?

12:29.749 --> 12:31.592
Stop fidgeting.
Sorry.

12:31.650 --> 12:33.721
I was hoping to speak
with Ron alone.

12:33.786 --> 12:36.130
He wants me here.
He invited me.

12:36.355 --> 12:37.732
Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah.

12:38.224 --> 12:41.330
Don't worry, Leslie.
Tammy's totally cool.

12:41.393 --> 12:43.100
Oh. Okay. Then,
I'll say it to her.

12:43.162 --> 12:44.800
You're evil
and you need to go.

12:46.799 --> 12:48.540
Leslie, you are a panic.

12:49.135 --> 12:50.842
Tammy, may l 
use the restroom?

12:51.370 --> 12:52.747
Remember to wash your hands.

12:55.841 --> 12:59.118
Okay. You know what?
Let's cut the crap.

12:59.178 --> 13:00.851
Is this audit even real?

13:01.046 --> 13:03.287
In a sense, yes.

13:03.349 --> 13:06.660
But in another, truer sense,
no, it is not.

13:07.353 --> 13:08.627
I want Ronald back.

13:08.921 --> 13:10.491
But I had to learn
about his finances

13:10.556 --> 13:12.058
to make sure my future
was protected.

13:12.491 --> 13:15.995
I'm impressed. He's acquired
quite a bit of gold.

13:16.996 --> 13:20.170
You gold digger.

13:20.232 --> 13:23.475
You are literally
a gold digger.

13:23.803 --> 13:27.945
The thing I love about Tammy
is she calls me on my crap.

13:28.007 --> 13:30.009
Every guy needs that.

13:34.780 --> 13:37.090
Okay. If you want
this company to survive,

13:37.149 --> 13:38.753
you immediately
need to downsize.

13:38.818 --> 13:40.798
I mean, you don't need
this airplane hangar.

13:40.886 --> 13:42.661
Um, I think we do.
And two,

13:42.721 --> 13:45.793
you have to keep
detailed financial records.

13:45.858 --> 13:47.735
Thank you. I've been
trying to tell them that.

13:47.793 --> 13:49.033
Waste of time.

13:49.094 --> 13:50.471
They wouldn't know
a Non-Employee

13:50.529 --> 13:52.270
Tax-Reportable
Expenditure Request

13:52.331 --> 13:54.106
if it bit them in the ass.

13:54.366 --> 13:57.108
Hey, guys. Which two people
here started their own company?

13:57.169 --> 13:59.410
'Cause I'm pretty sure
it wasn't you two bozos.

13:59.772 --> 14:00.773
Hey.

14:01.006 --> 14:03.509
Look, you guys can swagger
around all you want,

14:03.576 --> 14:06.489
but businesses
need revenue. Okay?

14:06.545 --> 14:09.185
Unless you start working
on an actual plan,

14:09.248 --> 14:11.228
you're dead in a month.
That's a fact.

14:11.283 --> 14:12.990
Ben, thanks for your time.

14:13.052 --> 14:16.192
But with all due respect, as
far as business decisions go,

14:16.255 --> 14:17.757
I think we know
what we're doing.

14:17.823 --> 14:19.803
Don't forget to grab
a free iPad on your way out.

14:21.360 --> 14:22.600
He didn't even grab one.

14:23.128 --> 14:24.630
Diabetes! Fight it!

14:26.498 --> 14:28.535
Not quite, but I like the energy.
Are we still rolling?

14:28.601 --> 14:30.205
Yep.

14:30.536 --> 14:31.606
Diabetes!
Okay.

14:31.670 --> 14:32.944
Let's... Can we take a break?

14:33.005 --> 14:35.576
I think that's a great idea.
I think we almost have it,

14:35.641 --> 14:37.882
and I am very excited
at that prospect.

14:37.943 --> 14:41.720
I'll cancel my 4:00 and my
5:00 and my 6:00 appointments.

14:41.780 --> 14:45.421
I cannot believe I dated him.
For a long time.

14:45.484 --> 14:47.327
And he broke up with me.

14:47.386 --> 14:50.833
Fat equals splat.
As in, "you're dead."

14:51.090 --> 14:52.194
ls there something there?

14:52.324 --> 14:53.962
No, that sucked.
But there's something there.

14:54.026 --> 14:55.505
I'm feeling it.
Let's go right away.

14:55.561 --> 14:58.041
It's magic time.
From the top, everybody.

14:58.464 --> 15:00.501
There's no one else here.

15:00.599 --> 15:02.772
Basically, we're being
attacked by Godzilla.

15:02.868 --> 15:05.678
And to beat Godzilla,
we need Mothra.

15:05.738 --> 15:07.513
No offense.
None taken.

15:07.573 --> 15:08.643
I'm very flattered.

15:09.041 --> 15:11.180
Who's this? Who's this
tall drink of water?

15:11.510 --> 15:13.751
Andy.
Hey, Andy.

15:13.812 --> 15:15.416
- How's it hanging?
- Listen.

15:15.481 --> 15:17.984
We need to break
Ron from her spell.

15:18.050 --> 15:20.656
Can't you just
move your butt around

15:20.719 --> 15:22.630
or wear a dress
made out of meat?

15:22.688 --> 15:26.864
Well, I could do all of those things
and have, but that bitch is crazy.

15:26.926 --> 15:29.634
When Ron left her
and we got together,

15:31.096 --> 15:32.803
she threw acid on my foot.

15:32.932 --> 15:35.105
Ew!
Could we take a peek at it?

15:35.601 --> 15:39.048
Listen. Tammy One was
my Sunday school teacher, too.

15:39.405 --> 15:41.385
She can pinpoint
your weaknesses,

15:41.440 --> 15:44.387
and then destroy you
with just one word.

15:44.843 --> 15:45.878
And ajar of acid.

15:45.945 --> 15:47.185
Oh, my God.

15:47.246 --> 15:49.692
I think I have an idea
that could save Ron.

15:49.748 --> 15:51.318
Don't joke around
Andy.

15:51.383 --> 15:53.863
I have ideas, too.

15:54.887 --> 15:56.389
You were right to come get me.

15:56.455 --> 15:58.901
My son, Ronny, always had a
weakness for those ladies.

15:58.958 --> 16:01.199
Oh, wow. Is this Ron?

16:01.260 --> 16:02.933
Yep. At the age of five.

16:02.995 --> 16:05.066
He's standing next to
the first chair he ever built.

16:05.130 --> 16:07.269
Oh, my God!

16:08.233 --> 16:11.112
There's a room
full of just guns.

16:11.170 --> 16:12.376
Why do you have so many guns?

16:13.505 --> 16:14.882
This is America, isn't it?

16:14.940 --> 16:16.248
Yes.

16:16.308 --> 16:18.219
Then, I don't have
to answer stupid questions

16:18.277 --> 16:20.188
while standing
on my own property.

16:20.245 --> 16:21.315
Let's go.

16:22.181 --> 16:24.058
Okay, well, that's
definitely Ron's mom.

16:27.019 --> 16:28.327
Tammy.

16:30.055 --> 16:32.001
Tammy.
Ronnie.

16:32.224 --> 16:33.430
What's going on?

16:33.492 --> 16:35.267
Welcome to the Battle Royale.

16:35.327 --> 16:37.068
Right here. Right now.

16:37.129 --> 16:41.236
Operation Soaring Falcon
is in its final stages.

16:41.900 --> 16:43.641
It's time to settle this.

16:44.903 --> 16:46.109
Ah!

16:47.139 --> 16:49.483
An old-fashioned
prairie drink-off.

16:49.575 --> 16:53.113
Oh, what's in that jug?
It smells like jet fuel.

16:53.178 --> 16:55.158
That's Swanson Family
Mash Liquor.

16:55.781 --> 16:59.024
Made from the finest corn
ever grown on American soil.

16:59.084 --> 17:02.759
Its only legal use is to strip
varnish off of speedboats.

17:03.288 --> 17:04.961
If you win, he's all yours.

17:05.023 --> 17:07.026
And if I win, I bring him
back to the farm for good.

17:07.826 --> 17:09.099
Wait. What?
That wasn't the deal.

17:09.428 --> 17:10.736
Pour it. I'm thirsty.

17:10.796 --> 17:12.400
Pour me one, too, then.
Let me in here.

17:12.964 --> 17:17.435
I'm going to join you. And if I
win, Ron stays here with us.

17:17.502 --> 17:18.948
Leslie, no
Don't drink that.

17:19.171 --> 17:21.583
We use it to burn
warts off of the mules.

17:31.016 --> 17:32.757
Poison!

17:33.719 --> 17:34.823
Ugh!

17:35.187 --> 17:36.996
I made a mistake.

17:37.356 --> 17:39.393
I made a mistake.

17:39.858 --> 17:40.893
Diabetes.

17:40.959 --> 17:42.802
How were we together
for five months?

17:43.328 --> 17:45.001
Well, you know, it's possible
you could just date a guy

17:45.064 --> 17:48.238
because of where you are
in your life emotionally.

17:48.333 --> 17:49.641
I mean, I suppose
you're right, John.

17:49.701 --> 17:50.873
Ann Perkins.

17:50.936 --> 17:53.246
I hate to say this, but I
have a stain on my shirt.

17:53.572 --> 17:56.075
Which means that everything
we've shot so far is unusable.

17:56.208 --> 17:59.553
But let's use this as an
opportunity to revisit the script.

17:59.945 --> 18:01.356
Delivery guy.
Hey.

18:01.413 --> 18:02.414
Diabetes!

18:05.551 --> 18:06.586
Had enough?

18:06.652 --> 18:08.598
Of this watered-down
baby formula?

18:08.654 --> 18:09.792
Not even close.

18:09.855 --> 18:11.664
Not even close.

18:12.758 --> 18:14.032
Marvin clonse.

18:15.928 --> 18:16.929
Glenn Close.

18:17.329 --> 18:18.865
Leslie, you don't
have to do this.

18:19.031 --> 18:20.840
Shh! Go to bed, Jimmy.

18:23.569 --> 18:24.570
Blech!

18:24.636 --> 18:27.776
I can't feel my face.
My face is numb.

18:33.846 --> 18:35.553
What is that?

18:36.081 --> 18:38.721
And together, we can
make a difference.

18:39.318 --> 18:41.059
That's it.
I think we've got it.

18:41.687 --> 18:43.132
Do you think we got it?
Yes.

18:43.188 --> 18:45.862
Yeah. We have it.
We had it seven hours ago.

18:46.725 --> 18:49.433
Oh, Ann, I know that
I can be intense,

18:49.495 --> 18:51.236
but I'm only trying to be
the best me that I can be.

18:51.730 --> 18:53.607
I want to thank you
for this opportunity.

18:53.665 --> 18:54.871
And your patience.

18:54.933 --> 18:57.038
And your intelligence and...

18:57.102 --> 18:58.877
Your insight.

18:58.937 --> 19:00.917
You really are
an amazing human being.

19:02.307 --> 19:03.650
Thank you.

19:05.144 --> 19:08.455
Oh, right.
That's why I dated him.

19:10.215 --> 19:11.285
Hey.

19:11.350 --> 19:12.886
I wanted to apologize.

19:12.951 --> 19:16.023
Uh, we brought in five
accountants to look at E 720,

19:16.088 --> 19:17.726
and they all said
the same thing you did.

19:17.789 --> 19:18.824
If we don't start
making changes,

19:18.891 --> 19:19.892
we're going to
lose the company.

19:19.958 --> 19:22.131
Okay. Well, first thing
you need to do?

19:22.194 --> 19:23.867
Get rid of four of
those accountants.

19:23.929 --> 19:25.602
You don't need
five accountants.

19:25.664 --> 19:27.143
Again, good advice.

19:27.533 --> 19:28.807
Here.

19:28.867 --> 19:32.576
Okay. You really... You need to
stop giving these away like candy.

19:32.638 --> 19:34.982
I bought that one personally.
As a thank-you.

19:37.809 --> 19:38.947
It's an iPad.

19:39.278 --> 19:41.087
Everybody prance, now

19:41.146 --> 19:43.353
Prance, prance, prance,
prance, prance

19:43.415 --> 19:44.723
She's had enough.
Call it off.

19:44.783 --> 19:46.660
That's not how it works.
She's out.

19:46.718 --> 19:48.026
Wait. I'm subbing in.

19:48.086 --> 19:51.533
April, no. That stuff will melt
the shell off a garden snail.

19:51.590 --> 19:54.434
Whatever. I'm Puerto Rican.
I can handle it.

19:58.864 --> 20:00.673
Oh, my God.

20:00.732 --> 20:02.541
Okay. This ends now.

20:20.152 --> 20:21.153
Ah.

20:21.687 --> 20:23.030
Mom?

20:23.689 --> 20:26.932
You're going back to the farm.
And you? Hmm?

20:26.992 --> 20:28.403
You're going back to hell.

20:28.460 --> 20:30.872
Fine. I got what
I came for, anyway.

20:30.929 --> 20:33.535
I found your underground safe.
I stole half your gold.

20:33.832 --> 20:35.675
That's decoy gold.

20:35.734 --> 20:38.374
You think I'd leave my gold in a
locked safe buried underground,

20:38.437 --> 20:40.474
where anyone could find it?

20:40.539 --> 20:41.916
You don't know me at all.

20:41.974 --> 20:45.080
Yes, I do. I knew you
the minute you were born.

20:45.143 --> 20:47.749
I intend to be there
the minute you die.

20:50.616 --> 20:53.028
Ron, your family is weird.

20:56.288 --> 20:58.393
Literally,
there's someone reading a magazine

20:58.457 --> 21:00.164
and someone
applying nail polish.

21:00.525 --> 21:01.663
What's... What is she doing?

21:01.727 --> 21:03.331
She's just playing
with an iPad.

21:03.395 --> 21:06.808
Tom told me
that chair was $27,000.

21:07.466 --> 21:09.002
That chair, that has a roof.

21:09.201 --> 21:12.375
There's someone over there
in a deep sleep.

21:12.437 --> 21:16.715
She's probably being paid
upwards of $100,000 a year.

21:17.009 --> 21:18.886
There's this video of a boat.

21:19.878 --> 21:21.721
Look at that thing.
What is that?

21:21.780 --> 21:23.987
What are you supposed to do
with that thing?

21:24.305 --> 21:30.460
