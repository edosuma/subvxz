WEBVTT

00:49.632 --> 00:50.592
Rufus?

01:22.248 --> 01:24.667
How did Josh end up down there with Eden?

01:24.751 --> 01:27.128
I don't know.
That's what we're trying to find out.

01:27.212 --> 01:31.049
This morning,
he was asking Jamie about the Omega Key.

01:31.132 --> 01:33.968
-Oh, thanks for the coffee, Daniel.

01:35.512 --> 01:37.138
It was so nice to get caught up.

01:37.639 --> 01:39.724
I agree. It's been far too long.

01:40.475 --> 01:42.018
Hang on. I'll go get the drill.

01:42.102 --> 01:44.270
Oh, hey, I really appreciate it.

01:44.354 --> 01:45.772
Mine's, like, 30 years old,

01:45.855 --> 01:47.982
which is probably why
it fritzed out on me.

01:50.527 --> 01:51.945
Oh, hey, guys.

01:52.612 --> 01:55.824
Bode, what'd you do to get so dirty?

01:56.366 --> 01:58.868
Oh, I was just playing around. Exploring.

01:59.369 --> 02:01.246
You remember Detective Mutuku?

02:01.830 --> 02:03.540
Hey, Kinsey, Bode. How are you?

02:04.374 --> 02:05.208
Fine.

02:05.291 --> 02:06.251
Yeah.

02:06.334 --> 02:07.377
Be right back.

02:10.130 --> 02:13.174
Do you see how easy it is for us
to get close to your mom?

02:14.425 --> 02:16.386
Get out of here right now.

02:16.886 --> 02:20.598
Well, I would,
but I still gotta borrow your mom's drill.

02:21.724 --> 02:23.393
Did you make a decision?

02:26.396 --> 02:28.565
What decision? What is he talking about?

02:28.648 --> 02:30.150
He's just trying to scare us.

02:30.650 --> 02:32.402
My sister told you to leave.

02:38.408 --> 02:41.077
I could rip your throat out if I wanted.

02:42.120 --> 02:43.163
Right here.

02:48.585 --> 02:49.711
Here you go.

02:51.045 --> 02:53.965
Thank you so much.
I will bring it back tomorrow. Promise.

02:54.048 --> 02:55.758
See you real soon, kids.

02:55.842 --> 02:57.093
-Bye.
-Bye, Daniel.

03:00.346 --> 03:02.223
-What a nice man.

03:18.990 --> 03:21.117
-Yeah?
-Ty, where are you?

03:27.540 --> 03:28.458
Kinsey.

03:34.923 --> 03:36.966
Paramedics thought it was an aneurysm.

03:39.260 --> 03:40.303
You tried.

03:41.763 --> 03:44.182
The Alpha Key, it just didn't work.

03:45.016 --> 03:46.768
It does work. It just…

03:48.645 --> 03:51.606
just kills the demon
and the person it's attached to.

03:52.523 --> 03:54.901
That's not on you. You didn't kill her.

03:55.902 --> 03:58.112
Gabe did that
when he made her into a demon.

04:00.073 --> 04:01.282
We need to kill him.

04:02.867 --> 04:04.118
I don't care what it takes.

04:04.619 --> 04:07.205
If he wasn't an echo,
it'd be a lot easier.

04:08.539 --> 04:10.083
I'm gonna go back over there.

04:11.125 --> 04:13.753
-To do what? Do you have a plan?
-We can't just sit here!

04:13.836 --> 04:14.921
Ty?

04:15.004 --> 04:15.838
Oh.

04:16.464 --> 04:19.008
Honey, I just heard the news about Jackie.

04:19.842 --> 04:20.969
I'm so sorry.

04:22.011 --> 04:24.389
It's such a shock. She was so lovely.

04:25.932 --> 04:26.891
Yeah.

04:28.893 --> 04:29.727
Hey.

04:30.853 --> 04:33.189
I know how hard it is
to lose someone that you love.

04:34.440 --> 04:37.485
I know you're trying to be helpful
right now, Mom, but you really…

04:37.986 --> 04:39.445
You can't understand. Okay.

04:39.988 --> 04:42.198
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to say the wrong thing.

04:42.282 --> 04:45.576
You didn't. I just…
I can't talk about this right now.

04:47.161 --> 04:47.996
Okay.

04:48.496 --> 04:49.414
Ty.

04:56.087 --> 04:57.922
I was just trying to be supportive.

04:58.423 --> 05:00.550
You didn't do anything wrong, Mom.

05:01.217 --> 05:02.176
I promise.

05:03.886 --> 05:05.722
Ty, Mom's just trying to be helpful.

05:05.805 --> 05:07.974
I don't need sympathy! I need to end this!

05:08.057 --> 05:10.143
Stop! You understand, right?

05:10.226 --> 05:11.936
He's holding all the cards.

05:13.313 --> 05:15.148
I saw where he took the Demon Key. I can…

05:15.231 --> 05:17.608
I can go.
I can go and get it. I can stop this.

05:17.692 --> 05:21.195
No. I'm not letting you go over there
just to get yourself killed.

05:22.322 --> 05:23.531
What do you suggest?

05:26.242 --> 05:28.244
I'm the only one who can fix this.

05:47.347 --> 05:48.222
Hello?

05:50.641 --> 05:52.602
-Who's that?

05:55.938 --> 05:57.774
Well, don't you look like shit?

05:58.775 --> 06:02.028
-I'm glad you made it out though.
-You cannot just walk in here, Eden.

06:03.571 --> 06:07.450
Aren't these your, like,
precious historical documents?

06:07.533 --> 06:09.118
I've been wasting my time.

06:09.202 --> 06:12.372
I cannot keep following
these lunatic musings.

06:12.455 --> 06:13.331
Why not?

06:13.414 --> 06:17.126
Frederick Gideon terrorized every citizen
in every town on the North Shore.

06:17.210 --> 06:20.213
He murdered innocent people
he suspected of being rebels.

06:20.838 --> 06:23.091
Created chaos and fear.

06:26.761 --> 06:28.304
Quite the force, wasn't he?

06:28.805 --> 06:31.057
Here I am obsessing over this

06:32.058 --> 06:33.226
horrible person.

06:35.645 --> 06:37.105
And now it's over.

06:39.732 --> 06:41.734
You can't say it's over
after I've done my part.

06:41.818 --> 06:44.987
-You were supposed to show me the door.
-I did show you the door.

06:45.071 --> 06:46.864
Oh, really? I would have remembered that.

06:46.948 --> 06:49.033
What I do remember is
you taking me to the sea caves

06:49.117 --> 06:52.078
where we got caught in a giant landslide,
and I almost died.

06:52.829 --> 06:54.789
You might not remember it,

06:54.872 --> 06:57.041
but I showed you the door,

06:57.125 --> 06:59.836
so I'm gonna need you
to hold up your end of the deal.

06:59.919 --> 07:02.171
Get me the Omega Key.

07:03.589 --> 07:04.757
Are you insane?

07:06.134 --> 07:10.012
I would kill you if it wouldn't
make my life so much more difficult.

07:10.096 --> 07:12.056
-What? Do you wanna get expelled?

07:12.140 --> 07:13.933
Firstly, like I could give a shit.

07:14.016 --> 07:17.186
And secondly,
let's tell the administrative board

07:17.270 --> 07:19.564
that my teacher invited--

07:19.647 --> 07:21.732
No, insisted

07:21.816 --> 07:24.777
that I go down to the sea caves with him.

07:24.861 --> 07:26.988
That is not what happened.
You took me there.

07:30.867 --> 07:33.536
Go screw yourself, Josh.

07:41.752 --> 07:43.296
When it gets dark,

07:43.379 --> 07:46.090
you're all gonna follow Mutuku
over to Keyhouse.

07:47.467 --> 07:49.594
Job one is to get rid of Nina Locke.

07:50.219 --> 07:51.220
Kill her.

07:52.930 --> 07:55.016
She's not gonna become one of us.

07:55.099 --> 07:56.893
She's just gonna be dead.

07:58.227 --> 07:59.645
All right, go get ready.

08:01.939 --> 08:02.815
Let's go.

08:06.402 --> 08:10.072
If you feel like getting rid of
the rest of the Lockes, have at it.

08:11.365 --> 08:13.075
Everyone except for Kinsey.

08:14.368 --> 08:16.162
I'll handle her myself, understood?

08:17.330 --> 08:18.206
Kinsey?

08:18.789 --> 08:20.416
-Yeah.
-No.

08:20.500 --> 08:21.751
Kinsey.

08:37.183 --> 08:38.059
Hey.

08:38.643 --> 08:39.477
Hey.

08:44.440 --> 08:47.276
If I'm being honest,
I… I didn't expect you to show up.

08:48.611 --> 08:49.612
Here I am.

08:52.156 --> 08:53.199
Yeah, you are.

09:02.416 --> 09:03.793
I thought about your offer.

09:05.419 --> 09:08.089
In fact, it's pretty much all I've done.

09:09.298 --> 09:10.132
And?

09:11.676 --> 09:14.887
You want me
to want to join you voluntarily,

09:15.972 --> 09:17.306
but you've trapped me.

09:17.974 --> 09:20.101
You've made it
so I don't have any other choice.

09:20.184 --> 09:23.271
Kinsey, whatever I am,
I still have a human soul.

09:23.938 --> 09:25.898
-I meant what I said.

09:26.732 --> 09:28.818
You seriously think you love me?

09:29.986 --> 09:31.237
If I didn't,

09:32.488 --> 09:33.781
you'd already be dead.

09:45.126 --> 09:46.460
This isn't about love.

09:47.169 --> 09:49.422
This is about you wanting to control me.

09:50.381 --> 09:52.174
But that's never gonna happen.

09:53.926 --> 09:57.013
Because I realized
the one thing I can still control…

09:58.889 --> 10:00.057
is my own fate.

10:11.694 --> 10:12.528
Kinsey.

10:24.915 --> 10:25.916
Kinsey!

10:27.918 --> 10:31.547
I will never, ever be yours.

10:43.684 --> 10:45.394
Are you kidding me?

10:50.900 --> 10:52.360
They're headed to the vault!

10:55.404 --> 10:57.156
They'll never get there.

11:08.376 --> 11:09.960
The key's gotta be in there.

11:40.116 --> 11:41.075
I'll do it.

11:56.382 --> 11:57.883
Shit. Guys, I need more time.

11:59.176 --> 12:00.261
We got this.

12:20.656 --> 12:21.824
Give me the key.

12:21.907 --> 12:23.743
-I don't think so.

12:31.792 --> 12:32.793
Scot!

12:43.596 --> 12:45.431
-How's it looking, Duncan?
-I'm almost there.

12:45.514 --> 12:47.183
-More!

13:22.635 --> 13:24.637
Get them! Now!

13:29.266 --> 13:30.559
Get back! Stop!

13:37.817 --> 13:39.401
Holy shit.

13:40.152 --> 13:41.028
What happened?

13:43.948 --> 13:46.075
I think it's because
I made the Demon Key.

13:49.161 --> 13:50.246
Turn around!

13:56.335 --> 13:58.838
Yeah. My blood is tied to it.

13:59.672 --> 14:01.924
So they'll do whatever you say?

14:02.466 --> 14:04.510
Brilliant.

14:06.387 --> 14:07.596
Get Dodge.

14:08.931 --> 14:10.099
Stop!

14:10.182 --> 14:13.018
I command you, stop!

14:14.645 --> 14:16.313
Watch out, watch out!

14:20.526 --> 14:23.320
Got it. Let's get the hell out of here.

14:53.726 --> 14:54.768
Dodge?

15:14.121 --> 15:15.414
Don't come any closer!

15:15.497 --> 15:16.957
Hey! Bode!

15:17.666 --> 15:20.252
Bode, it's okay. It's me. Ellie.

15:21.253 --> 15:22.880
-Ellie?
-Yeah.

15:28.260 --> 15:30.304
Wait, if you're Ellie,

15:31.513 --> 15:33.015
can you take this key from me?

15:41.106 --> 15:42.441
-Ellie!
-Hi!

15:43.567 --> 15:45.152
Hi. Hey.

15:46.362 --> 15:47.529
Where's Rufus?

16:08.384 --> 16:10.511
-Whoa, whoa, where you going?
-No, no, stay here!

16:20.771 --> 16:22.064
Now it's just you and me.

16:22.731 --> 16:25.192
Perfect. Just the way I wanted.

16:57.349 --> 16:59.518
Let me go!

17:00.060 --> 17:01.895
You wanna fight? Let's fight!

17:01.979 --> 17:04.398
Why couldn't you've just done
what I wanted?

17:08.152 --> 17:10.696
You could've had everything.

17:14.992 --> 17:17.870
Goodbye, Kinsey.

17:36.180 --> 17:37.431
-Kinsey!

17:38.265 --> 17:40.309
-Kinsey, come on! We gotta go!

18:08.796 --> 18:10.214
Holy shit!

18:11.006 --> 18:12.591
You made it. I can't even…

18:26.396 --> 18:28.065
-You okay?
-Yeah. Yeah.

18:35.072 --> 18:36.156
She's gone.

18:36.990 --> 18:38.700
She's really gone. We did it.

18:46.667 --> 18:47.751
Oh my God.

18:56.802 --> 18:57.928
No, no, no, no.

18:58.011 --> 18:59.429
No, it's okay. It's…

19:00.305 --> 19:01.390
It's not Dodge.

19:03.183 --> 19:04.226
It's Lucas.

19:05.435 --> 19:07.646
The Alpha Key separated him from Dodge.

19:09.940 --> 19:13.193
But how come he didn't die
like the rest of the demons?

19:13.819 --> 19:16.029
Because Lucas is an echo.

19:16.947 --> 19:18.740
So, well, the key question is,

19:18.824 --> 19:22.286
is this Lucas remnant of Dodge,
is he good, or is he bad?

19:24.955 --> 19:26.373
I think these belong to you.

19:32.129 --> 19:33.630
Does that answer your question?

19:35.174 --> 19:36.842
Yeah, brilliant.

19:36.925 --> 19:39.887
So you've been in there all along?

19:40.596 --> 19:42.014
But I had no control.

19:43.932 --> 19:46.059
It was like I was forced
to watch it all happen.

19:47.895 --> 19:49.521
What that thing did to you, um…

19:51.815 --> 19:53.025
I'm so sorry.

19:56.028 --> 19:57.696
Good to have you back, Luke.

20:02.618 --> 20:03.535
It's Bode.

20:04.578 --> 20:06.330
-Hey!
-I've been calling you!

20:06.413 --> 20:09.958
-Yeah, we've been a bit busy here.
-You need to come home now.

20:10.584 --> 20:11.710
Why? What happened?

20:23.055 --> 20:25.766
-Mom's inside, so we have to be quiet.

20:26.266 --> 20:27.226
Bode.

20:27.976 --> 20:29.353
This is Lucas.

20:31.021 --> 20:33.649
We met back when you were a demon.

20:34.233 --> 20:35.234
I remember.

20:36.777 --> 20:38.946
You've got the Identity Key?

20:43.659 --> 20:44.701
Where's Ellie?

20:52.709 --> 20:54.253
Holy shit.

21:35.585 --> 21:37.421
-It's our fault that--
-No.

21:38.880 --> 21:39.798
It wasn't.

21:45.178 --> 21:46.054
Ellie?

21:48.640 --> 21:50.183
Lucas.

21:51.059 --> 21:52.352
It's me, Ellie.

21:54.229 --> 21:55.480
This time, it's just…

21:56.773 --> 21:57.733
just me.

22:31.391 --> 22:32.517
So messed up.

22:43.904 --> 22:46.323
You know,
if you need someone to talk to, I'm here.

22:46.406 --> 22:48.367
Could grab a coffee later or something.

22:48.450 --> 22:51.536
Yeah, no. That's not happening.

22:52.662 --> 22:53.955
Okay. Cool. Um…

22:54.039 --> 22:57.501
Have a good,
you know, good day.

23:01.213 --> 23:02.172
Ugh.

24:16.872 --> 24:21.209
Yes, all the donations go directly
to the victims' families.

24:21.960 --> 24:24.546
Gordy Shaw is organizing an event
at the end of the month.

24:24.629 --> 24:27.132
-I'd love to help out.
-I'll send over the details.

24:27.215 --> 24:30.427
-You're the best. Thanks.

24:38.602 --> 24:39.561
Josh.

24:40.896 --> 24:42.105
-Hi.
-Hi.

24:42.856 --> 24:45.025
Sorry, I hope
I'm not interrupting anything.

24:45.108 --> 24:46.776
No, just, um…

24:48.069 --> 24:49.696
getting ready to send Tyler off.

24:49.779 --> 24:54.201
He's heading out of town
to do some traveling over winter break.

24:55.202 --> 24:57.829
He just needs some time away.

24:58.872 --> 25:00.916
-Understandable.

25:02.375 --> 25:04.211
What… What happened there?

25:04.294 --> 25:05.420
Oh, yeah.

25:05.504 --> 25:08.173
I was hiking
on the north side of the island,

25:08.256 --> 25:11.760
and, uh, you know those signs that say
"Beware of Falling Rocks"?

25:12.302 --> 25:14.971
-Those are not just for show.
-Uh-huh. Apparently.

25:15.055 --> 25:17.974
So now I'm slowing down at deer crossings.

25:18.058 --> 25:19.017
Mmm.

25:19.100 --> 25:21.436
Look, Nina, I wanted to…

25:21.520 --> 25:24.898
Last time we saw each other,
I said some crazy stuff.

25:24.981 --> 25:26.858
It's okay. You don't need to, um--

25:26.942 --> 25:28.527
No, I do. I do. Uh…

25:30.612 --> 25:31.530
You were right.

25:33.698 --> 25:36.910
I… I was trying
to make sense of my wife's death,

25:36.993 --> 25:40.539
and… and it took me
to some pretty weird places,

25:40.622 --> 25:42.582
and I got lost there, and it…

25:44.125 --> 25:45.377
it wasn't healthy.

25:47.295 --> 25:49.714
But I'm pretty sure I'm over it now, and…

25:51.341 --> 25:54.511
I think
I finally found some peace.

25:56.388 --> 25:58.640
That's really nice to hear.

26:00.976 --> 26:04.354
So I'm taking Jamie snowboarding
this weekend,

26:04.437 --> 26:08.650
but I thought maybe when we got back,
you and I could have dinner.

26:09.901 --> 26:11.486
I'm really glad for you.

26:13.613 --> 26:15.991
I… I… I'm still, uh…

26:17.909 --> 26:19.786
I'm in sort of an in-between place.

26:21.037 --> 26:25.125
I've just been feeling so disconnected
from the kids lately, and, uh…

26:27.586 --> 26:29.838
I think I just need some more time.

26:29.921 --> 26:31.881
Sorry, I didn't mean
to put you on the spot.

26:31.965 --> 26:33.967
You take as much time as you need.

26:35.343 --> 26:36.636
I'm not going anywhere.

26:37.887 --> 26:38.847
I'm glad.

26:42.350 --> 26:45.145
Hey, Jackie. It's, uh… It's me, Tyler.

26:45.228 --> 26:48.398
It's… It's you! Say hi to yourself.

26:48.481 --> 26:49.316
Hello.

26:49.399 --> 26:52.360
We're recording this video
to remind you of all the times

26:52.444 --> 26:54.821
that we've used magical keys together.

26:54.904 --> 26:58.491
So one of the very first times,
I used the Head Key--

27:07.667 --> 27:08.710
You all packed?

27:09.252 --> 27:10.295
Yeah. Um…

27:10.962 --> 27:14.090
You mind doing me a favor?
Can you give me a ride to the bus station?

27:14.174 --> 27:16.718
I should be able to make
the00 a.m. to Boston.

27:17.719 --> 27:19.512
I don't think that's gonna be necessary.

27:20.764 --> 27:23.183
I know it's still a few weeks
till your 18th birthday,

27:23.266 --> 27:24.768
but since you're leaving…

27:28.480 --> 27:29.397
…happy birthday.

27:30.315 --> 27:31.483
Keys to the GTO.

27:31.566 --> 27:33.360
What? No.

27:33.443 --> 27:36.112
Yes. The fun for me was restoring her.

27:37.906 --> 27:38.948
She's yours.

27:42.494 --> 27:44.829
Wow, Duncan, this is, um…

27:48.291 --> 27:49.834
this is really incredible.

27:50.794 --> 27:51.711
Thank you.

27:52.212 --> 27:53.380
It's good timing.

27:55.715 --> 27:57.676
Gracie's ready for some new adventures.

28:15.402 --> 28:18.238
Uh, tried-and-true road trip essentials.

28:20.115 --> 28:21.616
Sorry to be a mom, but…

28:22.534 --> 28:23.618
I can't help it.

28:26.788 --> 28:28.206
You're allowed to be a mom.

28:34.003 --> 28:35.004
I, um…

28:38.341 --> 28:41.469
I was wrong when…
when I said you didn't understand.

28:41.553 --> 28:42.554
I think… I think…

28:46.266 --> 28:48.643
I think you probably understand
better than anyone.

28:50.854 --> 28:51.980
I love you.

28:56.651 --> 28:57.652
I know.

29:00.697 --> 29:04.284
Okay. Well,
I'm not gonna watch you drive off.

29:04.993 --> 29:08.621
I don't want your last image of home
to be me weeping on the front porch.

29:13.209 --> 29:14.627
Travel safe, honey.

29:16.755 --> 29:18.339
I love you, Mom. Bye.

29:27.307 --> 29:28.683
I have something for you.

29:29.642 --> 29:33.188
-I've been keeping them safe in my head.

29:34.731 --> 29:36.316
It's up to you to protect them now.

29:43.823 --> 29:45.158
But what if I can't?

29:45.700 --> 29:47.410
Eden's still out there.

29:48.536 --> 29:52.123
She's not a threat.
Probably Anywhere Keyed to Ibiza by now.

29:55.376 --> 29:59.339
You're the reason we beat Dodge, Kins.
You didn't hesitate. You knew what to do.

30:00.715 --> 30:01.716
Trust yourself.

30:06.304 --> 30:08.348
But I don't understand.

30:09.307 --> 30:11.768
Why haven't you used the Memory Key yet?

30:12.393 --> 30:16.022
Your birthday is coming up,
and next time we see you…

30:16.105 --> 30:19.818
…you won't remember the keys
or anything about them.

30:19.901 --> 30:20.985
That's my choice.

30:24.489 --> 30:27.116
I want to have a normal life.

30:29.702 --> 30:32.247
But you're still gonna be my brother.
That's not gonna change.

30:37.752 --> 30:38.586
Hey.

30:39.087 --> 30:42.590
While I'm gone,
promise me you'll listen to Kinsey.

30:42.674 --> 30:43.675
She's the boss now.

30:44.259 --> 30:46.219
And, uh, look out for Mom.

30:47.178 --> 30:48.137
Please,

30:49.138 --> 30:51.599
don't talk to any strange girls
in the well house.

32:04.714 --> 32:06.925
I wanted to give you something
before you left.

32:07.008 --> 32:08.134
It's in the basement.

32:08.217 --> 32:10.553
-Let it be a creepy clown head.

32:10.637 --> 32:14.307
Or… Or, like… like, a taxidermied ferret,
maybe, or something like that.

32:14.390 --> 32:15.934
-You're so weird.

32:22.398 --> 32:23.232
What's this?

32:24.108 --> 32:26.152
-Surprise!
-Goodbye!

32:26.903 --> 32:28.529
-What?
-Surprise, Scot.

32:30.740 --> 32:31.741
Surprise, buddy.

32:31.824 --> 32:33.201
-You!

32:33.743 --> 32:35.536
Better than a creepy clown head?

32:36.329 --> 32:40.708
You have outdone yourself this time,
Rocky Road.

32:55.890 --> 32:56.808
Mom?

32:57.642 --> 32:58.810
Yeah, bud?

33:02.021 --> 33:04.107
Uh, I wanna give you a gift.

33:06.192 --> 33:08.861
Something that I think
that will make you happy.

33:10.363 --> 33:11.322
What is it?

33:11.406 --> 33:12.865
It's a key.

33:14.075 --> 33:15.368
Well, I could see that.

33:16.911 --> 33:18.287
It's pretty unique.

33:19.372 --> 33:20.498
What's it open?

33:22.500 --> 33:23.668
Don't freak out,

33:24.460 --> 33:26.004
but right now,

33:27.171 --> 33:29.716
a keyhole is opening
on the back of your neck.

33:31.676 --> 33:32.760
What?

33:32.844 --> 33:36.305
Just please trust me.

33:37.223 --> 33:39.142
Put that key inside.

33:40.226 --> 33:44.063
Bode, what's going on here?

33:45.064 --> 33:46.232
Please trust me.

33:51.446 --> 33:52.447
Okay.

34:07.003 --> 34:08.921
-What is this?

34:18.264 --> 34:20.141
Oh… Is that…

34:22.643 --> 34:24.520
-No!

34:24.604 --> 34:25.730
Is that me?

34:25.813 --> 34:28.524
Uh, it's okay. I'll explain everything.

35:05.144 --> 35:06.187
Wow.

35:09.357 --> 35:11.192
This was my dad's chair.

35:14.112 --> 35:20.493
Okay, this store is filled
with my all-time favorite pieces!

35:20.576 --> 35:21.577
Like…

35:22.620 --> 35:23.746
all together…

35:25.206 --> 35:26.749
in one place.

35:26.833 --> 35:28.209
Exactly.

35:35.216 --> 35:36.259
Over here.

35:39.345 --> 35:40.388
What are these?

35:44.225 --> 35:46.519
They must be your memories of Dad.

35:47.562 --> 35:49.272
How are they inside here?

35:49.355 --> 35:51.274
Open one.

35:55.903 --> 35:58.698
-Okay. Are we done? I gotta do it right.
-No.

36:00.408 --> 36:02.285
Oh my God.

36:29.270 --> 36:31.522
It's quiet for a Saturday morning.

36:31.606 --> 36:32.773
Tyler is at a friend's

36:32.857 --> 36:36.277
and, um, Kinsey's working on
an art project up in her room.

36:36.360 --> 36:39.447
-Don't let it be puff paint.

36:39.530 --> 36:41.949
It took me weeks
to get that glitter out of my hair.

36:42.742 --> 36:43.784
What's all this?

36:44.785 --> 36:46.537
I'm making cinnamon buns.

36:47.121 --> 36:48.372
Oh, my favorite.

36:48.456 --> 36:52.877
It was meant to be a surprise,
but it's, um, taking longer than expected.

36:52.960 --> 36:56.088
-Anytime you bake, it's always a surprise.
-Ha, ha!

36:56.172 --> 36:57.882
All right, all right!

36:57.965 --> 36:59.467
What's the occasion?

36:59.550 --> 37:02.470
Can't I do something nice for you
just because?

37:03.054 --> 37:04.931
-All right. What is it?

37:05.014 --> 37:08.226
Some flea market find you need me
to pick up with my truck again?

37:10.519 --> 37:12.772
Oh no, it's the lower lip bite.

37:13.356 --> 37:14.607
This is serious.

37:16.901 --> 37:21.822
The only thing you love more than pastries
is puns, so I thought maybe…

37:21.906 --> 37:23.908
I thought…

37:31.249 --> 37:33.167
A bun in the oven.

37:34.794 --> 37:35.962
Oh my God.

37:36.045 --> 37:39.006
I know. We… We thought we were done.

37:40.174 --> 37:41.467
But surprise.

38:11.455 --> 38:13.874
The cinnamon buns
are still on the table, right?

38:22.508 --> 38:23.968
Was it a good memory?

38:28.556 --> 38:29.682
The best.

38:48.868 --> 38:51.579
I know you're gonna forget all this
pretty soon…

38:53.456 --> 38:57.126
but at least we got to do this together.

39:00.796 --> 39:03.466
But I… I don't wanna forget
all of this.

39:04.759 --> 39:05.926
Do I have to?

39:14.894 --> 39:15.853
I won't let you.

40:05.820 --> 40:07.822
Captain Frederick Gideon.

40:28.634 --> 40:31.095
Hello?

40:34.682 --> 40:35.850
Who are you?

40:41.230 --> 40:44.150
Oh my God, it's you.

40:44.942 --> 40:48.237
I thought I was just
conjuring some old, evil soldier dude.

40:48.320 --> 40:50.114
Didn't know you possessed him.

40:50.698 --> 40:52.366
That is so much better.

40:58.247 --> 41:01.292
Uh, you can't go there. You're an echo.

41:01.917 --> 41:03.627
Can't cross the threshold.

41:03.711 --> 41:05.337
Then get me free.

41:06.380 --> 41:10.384
Okay, I will, but first,
you have to understand some things.

41:11.427 --> 41:14.263
You are who you are in our world.

41:15.264 --> 41:16.724
But here's different.

41:17.725 --> 41:20.144
Here, I freed you.

41:22.605 --> 41:25.524
Here, I give the orders.

41:25.608 --> 41:26.817
Understand?

41:27.568 --> 41:29.820
The portal opened for you once before.

41:31.530 --> 41:33.407
I need you to open it again.

41:45.836 --> 41:46.962
Let's go.

41:53.469 --> 41:54.428
Let's go.

41:57.598 --> 42:00.184
-Put me down!

42:04.355 --> 42:05.272
As you wish.
