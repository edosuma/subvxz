00:11.245 --> 00:12.906
Twenty-four hour plumbing is a myth.

00:13.080 --> 00:16.607
I've called every plumber in town.
No one can come before tomorrow morning.

00:16.784 --> 00:20.117
By that time you'll need a snorkel.
Let me see what I can do.

00:20.588 --> 00:22.681
Oh, wrong way.

00:24.959 --> 00:28.190
The threads are history.
I need a wrench!

00:30.000 --> 00:36.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

00:44.311 --> 00:45.869
How did you do that?

00:46.047 --> 00:48.914
I just kept twisting and turning
and it stopped.

00:55.623 --> 01:00.287
Maybe one day I'll figure out how
Clark Kent does the things he does.

01:04.298 --> 01:06.630
You know the people
who moved into your house?

01:07.201 --> 01:10.693
They have this orange cat
that comes by the loft sometimes.

01:10.871 --> 01:14.272
I try to talk to him, but he's not
half the conversationalist you are.

01:16.510 --> 01:20.002
I have to admit,
I do miss those sunsets.

01:20.948 --> 01:22.540
Yeah.

01:22.750 --> 01:25.480
The sky's not really the same
when you see it alone.

01:27.221 --> 01:29.519
It's getting late.

01:30.791 --> 01:32.349
Yeah.

01:34.261 --> 01:37.458
I should go put this back.

01:46.841 --> 01:48.706
Any news from the military?

01:51.712 --> 01:55.375
I'm really worried.
Whitney's been missing for over a month.

01:55.549 --> 01:59.041
The military even sent back
his personal effects to his mom.

01:59.620 --> 02:02.248
She gave me my necklace back.

02:18.873 --> 02:21.171
You gonna start wearing that again?

02:21.942 --> 02:24.035
Doesn't feel right.

02:24.345 --> 02:27.178
Have to know he's safe first.

02:30.017 --> 02:32.884
If anyone can get through it, Whitney can.

02:35.122 --> 02:36.646
Thank you.

02:46.200 --> 02:49.829
Aceh Province, Indonesia

02:51.805 --> 02:55.172
This is pointless, Fordman.
They think we're dead.

02:55.342 --> 02:57.367
We're gonna make it back home,
you hear me?

02:57.545 --> 02:59.206
I'm gonna get back to see...

02:59.380 --> 03:01.541
Lana? I know.

03:01.715 --> 03:04.149
If I have to hear about Lana,
or Smallville...

03:04.318 --> 03:07.583
...or horseback riding in the
freaking meadow one more time...

03:09.223 --> 03:11.282
Move it! Move it!

03:20.834 --> 03:24.167
- Keep moving!
- We're not gonna make it!

03:26.240 --> 03:28.902
I got one flare left!
We just gotta make it to that ridge.

03:29.076 --> 03:31.636
The scouts'll see it from there.

03:35.316 --> 03:37.011
You all right?

03:37.184 --> 03:39.982
Oh, my goodness!
You're okay. You're okay.

03:42.456 --> 03:44.549
Come on, get up.

03:46.193 --> 03:48.491
Come on, keep moving. Come on.

04:57.998 --> 05:00.193
Don't you guys think you're
overreacting a bit?

05:00.367 --> 05:03.962
Not really. You spend your life thinking
you know the truth about someone...

05:04.137 --> 05:06.264
...only to find out
that it may be a total lie.

05:06.440 --> 05:09.773
They named the phone company after him.
Now Miss Biserri's telling us...

05:09.943 --> 05:12.343
...Alexander Graham Bell
snaked somebody else's invention?

05:12.512 --> 05:14.980
I haven't been this
disillusioned since I found out...

05:15.148 --> 05:17.548
...that Betsy Ross didn't
design the American flag.

05:17.718 --> 05:19.709
I mean, she was my role model.

05:19.886 --> 05:21.820
Betsy Ross was your role model?

05:21.989 --> 05:23.684
Yeah. In first grade.

05:23.857 --> 05:26.883
I mean, one day she was a pioneer
for women, and then the next...

05:27.060 --> 05:28.652
...she's a glorified seamstress.

05:28.829 --> 05:31.889
One by one, our heroes are being defrocked.

05:35.502 --> 05:39.199
You know, Lana, there's a winter festival
in Grandville this weekend.

05:39.373 --> 05:41.841
My mom's gonna have
a booth there for her produce.

05:42.009 --> 05:44.500
I was thinking maybe
we could go and hang out.

05:44.678 --> 05:46.646
I'm not sure.

05:46.813 --> 05:49.976
I have to take a couple of
extra shifts at the Talon.

05:50.584 --> 05:51.846
I know you're worried...

05:52.019 --> 05:55.352
...but working yourself to the bone
won't bring Whitney back any faster.

05:55.522 --> 05:57.615
It's okay to have a little fun.

05:59.326 --> 06:01.317
You're right.

06:01.495 --> 06:02.962
So you'll go.

06:03.130 --> 06:05.098
Yeah. Yeah, count me in.

06:55.248 --> 06:57.273
Whitney.

06:57.751 --> 06:59.048
I missed you so much.

06:59.219 --> 07:03.485
I can't believe you're here.
I can't believe you're back.

07:23.510 --> 07:26.911
Wow. It certainly is nice to hear
some good news for a change.

07:27.080 --> 07:30.072
Mrs. Fordman must be so relieved.
That's wonderful.

07:30.250 --> 07:31.808
Yeah.

07:32.652 --> 07:35.678
Why do I get the impression that you
won't be the grand marshal...

07:35.856 --> 07:39.087
...at Whitney's homecoming parade?
- I'm happy he's okay, I really am.

07:39.426 --> 07:40.893
It's just...

07:42.062 --> 07:44.462
I know this sounds selfish...

07:45.398 --> 07:48.697
...but things were just starting
to get better between me and Lana...

07:48.869 --> 07:51.895
...and now he's back.
- I thought Lana and Whitney had broken up.

07:52.072 --> 07:55.508
So did I. But now she's throwing
him a party tonight at the Talon.

07:56.076 --> 07:58.169
And you're going, right?

07:59.913 --> 08:02.609
I don't know if I can stomach
seeing them together again.

08:02.783 --> 08:04.580
Clark.

08:05.352 --> 08:07.877
You need to put your
personal feelings aside, son.

08:08.054 --> 08:12.218
Whitney risked his life for this country,
and he deserves a hero's welcome.

08:19.533 --> 08:22.593
It's so nice to have things back to normal.

08:22.769 --> 08:26.569
My son and the prettiest girl
in school together.

08:32.779 --> 08:34.905
I bet you thought you'd never see me again.

08:35.215 --> 08:37.649
I never gave up hope.

08:39.186 --> 08:41.950
When I was out there, lost...

08:42.121 --> 08:46.081
...the thought of seeing you again
was the only thing that kept me going.

08:52.699 --> 08:54.860
What is it? What's wrong?

08:55.468 --> 08:57.936
Whitney, you know
that video letter I sent you?

08:58.104 --> 09:00.572
Video letter? What did it say?

09:09.549 --> 09:12.541
Lana, there's something
you need to know about me.

09:13.653 --> 09:15.848
When my platoon was ambushed...

09:16.022 --> 09:17.785
...I was caught in an explosion...

09:18.058 --> 09:21.585
...and when I woke up,
some of my memory was wiped out...

09:21.862 --> 09:24.456
...and the doctors don't know
if I'll ever get it back.

09:24.631 --> 09:26.656
Whitney, it's okay.

09:27.267 --> 09:31.067
The one thing that I'll never forget
is how much I care for you.

09:31.238 --> 09:34.605
I just want things to be
like they used to be.

09:51.324 --> 09:54.054
Sorry I'm late.
I had a patient go into cardiac arrest...

09:54.227 --> 09:58.323
...and saying "Sorry, I have a date"
might have come off as slightly insensitive.

10:01.101 --> 10:04.161
Patient's fine now,
thanks for asking.

10:04.337 --> 10:07.306
You told me you never met my father.

10:13.246 --> 10:16.340
- Who took these photographs?
- A private investigator.

10:16.516 --> 10:18.040
You had me followed?

10:18.218 --> 10:20.118
No. I had my father followed.

10:20.287 --> 10:22.847
Unless you both share
a passion for feeding pigeons...

10:23.023 --> 10:25.150
...there must be a reason for your meeting.

10:25.358 --> 10:27.883
How long have you been working for him?

10:29.195 --> 10:33.029
Took me five dates to figure it out...
You're delusional.

10:33.199 --> 10:37.192
A hundred thousand dollars wired into your
account from LuthorCorp. Is that a delusion?

10:37.370 --> 10:40.464
- You checked my bank account?
- After I discovered you were having...

10:40.640 --> 10:43.200
...tete-a-tete with my father,
I ran a background check.

10:43.376 --> 10:47.142
I imagine those two weeks a year you spend
in Rwanda treating orphan children...

10:47.314 --> 10:49.748
...does wonders for your conscience.

10:49.916 --> 10:51.713
Who are you?

10:52.052 --> 10:54.213
Someone who's been burned
by the opposite sex...

10:54.387 --> 10:57.220
...more times than he cares to admit.

10:57.390 --> 10:59.153
So tell me.

10:59.326 --> 11:01.556
Why does a Harvard-educated physician...

11:01.728 --> 11:03.821
...a woman of supposed integrity...

11:03.997 --> 11:08.934
...accept a six-figure sum to spy on a man
she claims to have feelings for?

11:09.636 --> 11:10.933
First of all...

11:11.104 --> 11:13.868
...I don't recall claiming
anything of the sort.

11:14.040 --> 11:16.941
And second of all,
if you think I'm gonna put up...

11:17.110 --> 11:20.671
...with your pathetic, paranoid attempts
at invading my privacy...

11:20.847 --> 11:24.112
...you're even more arrogant
than everyone said you were.

11:43.503 --> 11:46.165
Unless the bathrobe passes for
haute couture these days...

11:46.339 --> 11:48.603
...I'm guessing someone's
not ready for the party.

11:48.775 --> 11:50.970
I don't know how this day
slipped by so fast.

11:51.144 --> 11:52.543
I was over at Whitney's...

11:52.712 --> 11:56.739
...Iooking at some old photos,
trying to refresh his memory.

11:57.250 --> 11:58.911
How's he doing?

11:59.085 --> 12:02.919
You know, surprisingly well,
considering everything he's been through.

12:03.089 --> 12:06.957
Did he mention your
award-winning Dear John video?

12:07.127 --> 12:09.061
He doesn't remember ever seeing it.

12:09.229 --> 12:10.821
He thinks we're still a couple.

12:10.997 --> 12:13.465
Well, that's got to be awkward.

12:14.534 --> 12:17.298
I can't turn my back on him now.

12:17.871 --> 12:20.169
He needs me more than ever.

12:20.340 --> 12:23.434
Could Lana Lang be falling
for the man in uniform?

12:23.610 --> 12:25.134
Why would you say that?

12:25.311 --> 12:29.611
I don't know. I just sense that this
may not be just a Florence Nightingale...

12:29.783 --> 12:32.377
...nursing a wounded soldier.

12:32.886 --> 12:36.378
I don't know how to feel, you know?
It's happening so fast.

12:36.556 --> 12:38.649
But seeing him again...

12:38.825 --> 12:43.091
...a lot of those feelings came back,
feelings I thought were long gone.

12:43.596 --> 12:46.531
Hence the 45-minute wardrobe crisis.

12:49.502 --> 12:53.165
The thing with Whitney
is that what you see is what you get.

12:53.339 --> 12:56.706
There are no mysteries.
No deep, dark secrets.

12:57.310 --> 12:59.107
Unlike someone we know.

13:15.528 --> 13:18.793
Catch any tape-delayed Sharks games?
They're burying the entire league.

13:18.965 --> 13:21.263
I'm not that interested
in football these days.

13:21.434 --> 13:25.461
If you're up for it, I'd love to set up an
exclusive interview with you for the Torch.

13:25.638 --> 13:28.163
I actually don't remember that much...

13:28.341 --> 13:31.640
...and what I do remember,
I'd rather not talk about.

13:31.911 --> 13:36.075
Now that I'm back home, I'd rather
focus on the more important things in life.

13:37.016 --> 13:38.278
Great.

13:41.888 --> 13:43.583
Hey, Clark.

13:43.756 --> 13:45.883
- Whitney, good to have you back.
- Hey, Fordman!

13:46.059 --> 13:49.085
- Yeah.
- Hey, dude, how you been, man?

13:49.262 --> 13:51.093
Listen, Clark, about Saturday.

13:51.264 --> 13:53.994
No, it's okay. I understand.

13:55.635 --> 13:57.728
What's going on this Saturday?

13:58.071 --> 13:59.732
Nothing.

14:02.675 --> 14:05.803
I take it you two saw a lot
of each other while I was gone?

14:06.212 --> 14:08.407
No, not especially.

14:09.716 --> 14:12.378
Clark and I are just friends, Whitney.

14:17.123 --> 14:19.353
I'm gonna get some punch.

14:31.271 --> 14:33.967
How could I have been so stupid?

14:43.550 --> 14:44.949
Whitney, what's going on?

14:45.118 --> 14:46.813
What's going on with you and Lana?

14:46.986 --> 14:48.613
Nothing.

14:48.788 --> 14:51.222
I kept my promise.
I looked out for her, that's it.

14:51.391 --> 14:53.655
Oh, yeah, you're a real class act, Kent.

14:53.826 --> 14:56.761
I go off and fight for my country
and you stab me in the back...

14:56.930 --> 14:59.626
...by trying to steal my girl.
- That's not what happened.

14:59.999 --> 15:02.399
How'd you do that to the door?

15:03.937 --> 15:07.771
I'm a trained U.S. Marine, Clark.
There's a lot of things I can do.

15:09.576 --> 15:12.101
Stay away from Lana.

15:23.590 --> 15:25.888
Lana? We need to talk.

15:26.059 --> 15:27.526
About what happened in the Talon?

15:27.694 --> 15:31.255
- Could have apologized over the phone.
- What are you talking about?

15:31.431 --> 15:34.025
Whitney said he walked in on you
wrecking the bathroom.

15:34.200 --> 15:35.861
He said you were in a jealous rage.

15:36.035 --> 15:38.003
No, he was the one
tearing up the bathroom.

15:38.171 --> 15:40.332
He said you told him
to stay away from me.

15:40.506 --> 15:44.135
What? I didn't say that. He's lying.

15:44.477 --> 15:47.344
After everything he's been through,
now you're calling him a liar?

15:47.814 --> 15:49.907
I can't believe you.

16:25.418 --> 16:29.320
Ma'am, I'm Lieutenant McNulty,
United States Marine Corps. May I come in?

16:29.489 --> 16:32.083
- Yes, of course.
- Thank you.

16:39.198 --> 16:41.029
Are you here to see Whitney?

16:41.200 --> 16:42.531
I beg your pardon?

16:42.702 --> 16:44.932
Hey, what's up, lieutenant?

16:45.938 --> 16:47.496
There must be some mistake.

16:47.674 --> 16:49.539
Mistake? What do you mean?

16:49.709 --> 16:52.542
Ma'am, according to my superiors,
your son is actually...

17:05.724 --> 17:08.522
I haven't seen Heisman in so long.

17:13.199 --> 17:15.359
You know what I miss the most?

17:15.667 --> 17:18.603
Times like this when it's just the two of us.

17:21.641 --> 17:23.836
Hey, you're wearing your necklace.

17:24.010 --> 17:26.604
Whenever I pictured you in my mind,
you always had it on.

17:26.779 --> 17:29.270
I haven't worn it since they sent it back.

17:29.449 --> 17:32.145
I wanted to know that you were safe first.

17:32.352 --> 17:34.013
Sent back?

17:34.320 --> 17:36.880
Oh, I gave it to you
when you left for basic training.

17:37.056 --> 17:40.992
They sent it back to your mom
when you were listed as missing.

17:42.261 --> 17:43.888
Why can't I remember?

17:45.398 --> 17:49.801
I know how hard this must be for you. But
isn't the important thing that you're alive?

17:49.969 --> 17:53.097
You know, that you're back
with people that care about you?

17:55.942 --> 17:58.103
Lana, I've been thinking.

17:58.978 --> 18:01.674
Now that Nell's gone, maybe...

18:02.081 --> 18:04.515
Maybe we should move in together.

18:07.420 --> 18:08.853
Whitney, we...

18:09.021 --> 18:11.512
We can't move in together.

18:13.593 --> 18:15.151
This is about Clark, isn't it?

18:15.328 --> 18:18.855
- I told you, Clark and I are just friends.
- He's got secrets, Lana.

18:19.132 --> 18:21.464
- What kind of secrets?
- You should be careful.

18:21.634 --> 18:22.896
He's not what he seems.

18:23.069 --> 18:26.561
- How do you know?
- Can we just not talk about Clark?

18:28.441 --> 18:30.636
Lana, I'm sorry. I didn't...

18:30.810 --> 18:34.769
I didn't mean to freak you out with
that whole moving-in thing. I just...

18:34.947 --> 18:37.745
I just want to be with you all the time.

18:39.519 --> 18:41.214
It's okay.

18:50.830 --> 18:54.823
Who knows what kind of inside information
she's given him about my company.

18:58.271 --> 19:00.239
Lex, you've been dating Helen for a while.

19:00.406 --> 19:04.206
Nothing you ever told me would lead me
to believe she's the espionage type.

19:06.712 --> 19:09.180
I'm afraid one day you'll learn
the frustrating truth.

19:09.348 --> 19:12.044
People are seldom whom they appear to be.

19:12.351 --> 19:14.251
Did she give you any kind of explanation?

19:14.420 --> 19:17.412
Didn't get that far. When she learned
that I had her investigated...

19:17.590 --> 19:19.353
...she turned hostile and stormed out.

19:19.525 --> 19:23.256
If I knew someone was investigating me,
I'd be a little ticked off too.

19:24.730 --> 19:27.290
You want to know
the most pathetic part about it?

19:27.467 --> 19:32.404
The first time I actually pictured a
future with a woman beyond two months.

19:33.072 --> 19:35.302
Did you ask her to explain
her side of the story?

19:35.475 --> 19:37.739
May not be what it looks like.

19:38.444 --> 19:41.845
I wish I shared your eternal optimism, Clark.

19:42.415 --> 19:45.748
I'm not sure how much
of an optimist I've been lately.

19:46.018 --> 19:50.352
Now that the quarterback's returned, you're
back at your own one-yard line with Lana?

19:51.123 --> 19:52.590
Be patient.

19:52.758 --> 19:55.192
Most quarterbacks' careers
don't last that long.

19:57.196 --> 19:59.164
It's not just that.

19:59.699 --> 20:03.465
I mean, I'm worried about him.
Since he's been back, he's been acting...

20:03.636 --> 20:06.628
...bizarre. Like he's someone else.

20:06.806 --> 20:08.967
He might be suffering from
post-traumatic stress.

20:09.141 --> 20:11.336
Some employees
went through it after the tornado.

20:11.511 --> 20:14.503
I sent them to a specialist in Metropolis.
They're doing better.

20:14.680 --> 20:17.877
- Maybe this specialist could help Whitney.
- It's worth a try.

20:18.050 --> 20:20.848
If you want, I can get him
an appointment this week.

20:21.020 --> 20:22.578
Yeah, thanks.

20:23.489 --> 20:24.786
What happened to you?

20:24.957 --> 20:27.050
Answer the question!

20:27.827 --> 20:30.091
What is my favorite radio station?

20:30.296 --> 20:31.729
I don't know.

20:31.898 --> 20:35.994
When I get in the car with Lana,
that radio has to be on the right station.

20:36.168 --> 20:37.965
What is it?

20:38.938 --> 20:41.839
It's the one that plays the loud rock.

20:42.008 --> 20:47.139
I think that there's a sticker
on one of your old schoolbooks.

20:47.313 --> 20:49.304
Please...

21:04.897 --> 21:07.092
What do you want now, Kent?

21:08.568 --> 21:11.469
Look, Whitney, I know
we've had our differences in the past...

21:11.637 --> 21:14.367
...but before you left,
I thought we had an understanding.

21:14.540 --> 21:16.303
- I'm worried about you.
- About what?

21:16.475 --> 21:17.567
You've been through a lot.

21:17.743 --> 21:20.803
Lex told me about this doctor
who deals with post-traumatic stress.

21:20.980 --> 21:23.972
If you're trying to break me and Lana up,
it's not gonna work.

21:24.150 --> 21:27.017
I know you've had a thing for her.
You always have.

21:27.186 --> 21:29.654
It's one of Clark Kent's many secrets.

21:29.822 --> 21:32.814
Whitney, this has nothing to do with Lana.
You need help.

21:32.992 --> 21:36.120
What I need
is for you to stay out of my life.

22:07.360 --> 22:09.453
Shut up!

22:12.965 --> 22:14.523
Clark, what's going on?

22:14.700 --> 22:18.101
I know this may sound crazy,
but Whitney may not be Whitney.

22:18.270 --> 22:21.262
Are you getting existential on us,
or is this Wall of Weird material?

22:21.474 --> 22:22.771
I think he's Tina Greer.

22:22.942 --> 22:24.569
The mighty morphing power girl?

22:24.744 --> 22:26.644
- What?
- The girl who was Lex, then Lana...

22:26.812 --> 22:30.043
...and then locked up.
- I know who she is, but it's impossible.

22:30.216 --> 22:32.081
Why? She was obsessed with Lana,
remember?

22:32.251 --> 22:35.652
Maybe she escaped to see her.
Who better to impersonate than Whitney?

22:35.821 --> 22:37.618
She couldn't pull a Martin Guerre.

22:37.790 --> 22:39.121
- Why not?
- Because she's dead.

22:39.291 --> 22:41.350
- What?
- She committed suicide last week.

22:41.527 --> 22:43.757
I'm running a story on it on page two.

22:43.929 --> 22:45.794
- What happened?
- The authorities said...

22:45.965 --> 22:50.231
...she went into the art-therapy room at the
hospital, doused herself in paint thinner...

22:50.436 --> 22:53.462
...and lit a match.
- Okay, now that's nasty.

22:53.639 --> 22:55.231
I know. Tina wrote a note saying...

22:55.408 --> 22:58.309
...she didn't know who she was anymore.
She couldn't take it.

22:59.979 --> 23:02.311
Did they ID her dental records?

23:07.687 --> 23:09.780
There's something else about Tina.

23:11.524 --> 23:14.049
I think she may know about my abilities.

23:14.226 --> 23:16.387
- You think?
- I had to use them to stop her.

23:16.562 --> 23:19.395
Once she was declared insane,
I figured I didn't have to worry.

23:19.565 --> 23:20.930
Well, you gotta worry now.

23:21.100 --> 23:23.193
What about the meteor rocks?
Does she know?

23:23.369 --> 23:25.894
Yeah, she used
Lana's necklace against me.

23:26.072 --> 23:27.369
You better be careful, man.

23:27.540 --> 23:29.440
I'm gonna go find Tina. You warn Lana.

23:29.608 --> 23:31.542
Warn me about what?

23:33.145 --> 23:35.909
Lana, this may be hard
for you to understand, but...

23:36.749 --> 23:39.616
...we may think that
Whitney's actually Tina Greer.

23:39.952 --> 23:42.352
Why would you say that?

23:43.222 --> 23:46.214
- You just have to believe me.
- This is just insane.

23:47.560 --> 23:50.529
I know it's a lot to process, but it's true.

23:51.931 --> 23:55.264
I'm going to the Fordmans',
you stay here with Pete till I get back.

24:00.005 --> 24:01.370
I need some time alone.

24:01.540 --> 24:04.907
I understand, Lana,
but that freak is dangerous.

24:05.377 --> 24:06.708
I know.

24:18.657 --> 24:20.420
You're Tina.

24:37.209 --> 24:39.541
Who you calling a freak?

24:41.647 --> 24:43.774
Mrs. Fordman?

24:54.860 --> 24:56.851
Mrs. Fordman?

25:01.200 --> 25:02.861
Are you okay?

25:03.135 --> 25:05.933
- Where's Whitney?
- I don't know.

25:06.105 --> 25:08.733
Whoever it is, it is not my son.

25:09.809 --> 25:12.437
That girl, she's some kind of monster.

25:12.611 --> 25:14.238
Okay.

25:15.714 --> 25:17.807
Lana, we have to talk.

25:17.983 --> 25:20.008
Could you give me a second?
It's kind of...

25:20.186 --> 25:22.518
It can't wait. Sit down.

25:24.490 --> 25:26.515
Lana...

25:29.862 --> 25:32.023
...will you marry me?

25:32.832 --> 25:36.063
I understood why you didn't
want to move in together...

25:36.235 --> 25:39.466
Now it'll be legal,
and we can elope and get out of Smallville.

25:39.638 --> 25:43.233
Whitney, this is crazy.
You know I'm still in high school.

25:43.409 --> 25:47.846
My mom was only 16 when
she married my dad. This is her ring.

25:51.050 --> 25:53.018
I'm sorry.

25:53.185 --> 25:55.244
I can't accept it.

25:55.421 --> 25:57.150
Why not?

25:59.859 --> 26:01.656
Whitney, that...

26:01.827 --> 26:03.692
That video letter I sent you.

26:04.296 --> 26:07.265
There were some things that I said...

26:07.433 --> 26:09.458
...that I can't keep from you anymore.

26:09.635 --> 26:11.193
Like what?

26:12.304 --> 26:14.363
I said that I...

26:17.810 --> 26:20.540
I told you I thought we should
go our separate ways.

26:20.713 --> 26:23.876
I didn't want to say anything
when you said you couldn't remember.

26:24.049 --> 26:28.213
You've been through so much,
and I didn't want to hurt you like that.

26:29.588 --> 26:31.556
I will always...

26:31.724 --> 26:33.055
...care about you, Whitney.

26:33.225 --> 26:36.456
- But you care more about Clark.
- This has nothing to do with Clark.

26:36.629 --> 26:39.393
Don't lie to me.

26:40.165 --> 26:44.226
Look me in the eye and tell me
you don't have feelings for him.

26:45.771 --> 26:48.069
I have to get back to work.

26:51.043 --> 26:52.738
It's okay.

26:52.912 --> 26:54.470
It's okay.

26:54.713 --> 26:58.046
Thing that combat taught me is how to...

26:58.617 --> 27:00.380
...deal with loss...

27:00.552 --> 27:02.417
...and move on.

27:03.389 --> 27:05.050
I'm sorry.

27:07.426 --> 27:10.759
If I could just ask you for one thing.

27:11.764 --> 27:13.061
Of course.

27:14.300 --> 27:17.463
Your necklace...
Do you think I could have it? L...

27:18.404 --> 27:22.238
It's just something to remember you by.
I know it means a lot to you.

27:24.043 --> 27:25.874
It does.

27:29.949 --> 27:32.509
That's why I want you to have it.

27:47.399 --> 27:48.661
Hey, Dad.

27:48.834 --> 27:50.529
Oh, hi, Clark.

27:50.703 --> 27:53.171
Say, how's Mrs. Fordman doing?

27:53.339 --> 27:55.569
They're gonna keep her overnight.

27:56.075 --> 27:58.100
She's pretty freaked out
by this whole thing.

27:58.277 --> 27:59.972
Who could blame her, right?

28:02.181 --> 28:04.649
Any idea where Tina is now?

28:04.817 --> 28:06.284
No.

28:06.719 --> 28:08.846
She could be anyone.

28:11.957 --> 28:14.187
You're right about that.

28:22.602 --> 28:25.765
I always wondered
how you beat me, Clark.

28:26.105 --> 28:29.700
You should be dead, but you're not.

28:29.976 --> 28:32.740
The meteor shower must have
done something to you too.

28:35.181 --> 28:36.739
Looks painful.

28:41.420 --> 28:43.854
Tina, don't do this.

28:44.023 --> 28:46.218
If I want to be with Lana...

28:46.392 --> 28:48.417
...I don't have a choice.

28:49.729 --> 28:51.697
Last year...

28:51.864 --> 28:53.263
...you threatened to kill her.

28:53.432 --> 28:57.061
Yeah. It was the worst mistake of my life.

28:57.236 --> 29:00.364
She rejected me,
and I acted without thinking.

29:01.140 --> 29:03.108
But I love her...

29:04.377 --> 29:07.608
...and I'll do anything to be with her.

29:08.114 --> 29:11.914
And I finally figured out
who Lana wants to be with.

29:14.020 --> 29:15.954
It's gonna be easy to become you, Clark.

29:16.122 --> 29:18.647
No. Stay away from her.

29:18.824 --> 29:20.689
You have the perfect life.

29:21.227 --> 29:24.253
Great parents, good friends.

29:24.430 --> 29:29.367
And most importantly, the girl of our dreams
waiting for you to finally make a move.

29:37.043 --> 29:39.204
No!

29:47.954 --> 29:51.253
I'm not used to people ignoring my calls.

29:53.926 --> 29:56.190
- I have to get to work.
- Look, you can at least...

29:56.362 --> 29:58.762
...offer me some kind of explanation.

29:58.931 --> 30:00.728
Your father did approach me, Lex.

30:00.900 --> 30:03.368
He did offer me money,
but not to spy on you.

30:03.536 --> 30:04.901
Then what did he want?

30:05.071 --> 30:06.834
He wanted me to dump you.

30:07.006 --> 30:10.908
Even after I told him to go to hell,
he wired the money anyway.

30:11.344 --> 30:14.245
So I guess he succeeded
in exactly what he set out to do.

30:14.413 --> 30:15.971
Break us up.

30:16.148 --> 30:19.879
You're telling me my father offered you
$ 100,000 against your will?

30:20.052 --> 30:21.349
Why would he do that?

30:21.520 --> 30:24.978
I can't even begin to fathom the depths
of the Luthor family pathology.

30:25.157 --> 30:27.887
- You could have told me.
- I was about to...

30:28.060 --> 30:32.360
...but before I could say a word, I realized
I was in the middle of an interrogation.

30:36.002 --> 30:37.663
Helen.

30:38.771 --> 30:40.534
- Lf I had known...
- No, no, no.

30:40.706 --> 30:42.537
I'm glad that this happened.

30:42.708 --> 30:45.506
It showed me
who I was really dealing with.

30:46.445 --> 30:49.437
You know, I've done some
pretty stupid things in my life...

30:49.615 --> 30:53.142
...but this could possibly win
the Nobel Prize for stupidity.

30:53.452 --> 30:56.649
I fell for someone
who never really existed.

32:31.450 --> 32:32.781
Hey.

32:32.952 --> 32:36.046
Sorry. I hope you don't mind. I...

32:36.288 --> 32:38.085
I need... I'm sock-deprived.

32:38.257 --> 32:40.350
All my clothes are stuck on spin.

32:40.526 --> 32:44.656
Well, go ahead.
I've gotta go to the Talon and close out.

32:47.466 --> 32:50.697
I bumped into Whitney.
He told me what happened.

32:52.805 --> 32:54.067
Is he okay?

32:54.440 --> 32:56.840
Well, he said you're not
an easy girl to get over...

32:57.009 --> 32:59.000
...but he knows you'll be happy with Clark.

32:59.178 --> 33:01.806
I told him this has nothing to do with Clark.

33:01.981 --> 33:05.246
Come on, Lana,
it's obvious you two belong together.

33:06.285 --> 33:09.846
Okay, now you're starting to act strange.

33:12.324 --> 33:15.020
- Why?
- Well, given your past history with Clark...

33:15.194 --> 33:18.686
...I'm surprised you're so eager
to play matchmaker.

33:25.738 --> 33:27.603
Don't think it's easy for me, Lana.

33:28.607 --> 33:31.906
I just don't want to stand in the way
of what's meant to be.

33:37.183 --> 33:38.878
Sorry.

33:45.691 --> 33:47.318
Clark!

33:48.594 --> 33:50.459
He's down here!

33:50.629 --> 33:53.393
Clark! Son.

33:53.866 --> 33:57.131
- Are you all right? What happened?
- The ship saved me.

33:57.303 --> 33:58.565
How'd it do that?

33:58.737 --> 34:01.467
I don't know,
but look what it did to the necklace.

34:03.275 --> 34:04.606
Oh, my God.

34:04.777 --> 34:06.404
I have to save Lana.

34:06.579 --> 34:08.513
Wait, Clark.

34:29.568 --> 34:31.866
- Hey.
- Sorry. Did I scare you?

34:33.138 --> 34:36.437
No, I just... I wasn't expecting
to see anyone this late.

34:39.043 --> 34:41.170
Lana, there's something I should tell you.

34:41.347 --> 34:44.145
When I saw you with Whitney,
I realized that...

34:44.315 --> 34:48.047
...if I didn't act on my true feelings,
I could lose you forever.

34:49.021 --> 34:51.353
Did someone put something
in the water supply?

34:51.523 --> 34:54.014
Because everyone's
acting really strange today.

34:54.193 --> 34:57.492
I'm acting the way I should have
acted the first time I met you.

34:59.098 --> 35:01.430
Lana, I love you.

35:13.379 --> 35:14.937
Clark.

35:35.091 --> 35:37.059
- Get away from her!
- What's going on?

35:37.226 --> 35:39.353
I'll explain everything when
I get you away from Tina.

35:39.762 --> 35:42.060
- Tina?
- No, Lana. That's Tina.

35:43.199 --> 35:45.895
- Lana, it's me, Clark.
- Don't listen to him. He's lying.

35:46.068 --> 35:48.730
The guy who fixed the leaky drain pipe.

35:50.573 --> 35:54.805
- No, we're supposed to be together.
- Stay away from me, you freak!

35:54.977 --> 35:56.444
No!

36:00.750 --> 36:02.274
You ruined everything!

36:13.629 --> 36:16.189
I'm gonna kick your ass, Kent.

36:16.699 --> 36:18.633
Bring it on.

36:54.804 --> 36:58.001
Tina! Listen to me.

36:58.174 --> 37:00.005
You don't have to do this.
You can stop.

37:00.176 --> 37:01.871
I can help you.

37:05.314 --> 37:08.249
Why don't you just die?

37:17.760 --> 37:19.387
Tina.

37:25.968 --> 37:29.529
Take care of Lana.

37:47.924 --> 37:50.358
How's Mrs. Fordman?

37:53.663 --> 37:56.325
The military officer that Tina murdered...

37:56.499 --> 38:00.492
...was coming to tell Mrs. Fordman
that they had found Whitney's body.

38:02.038 --> 38:05.496
- Whitney died in combat.
- Oh, my God!

38:05.675 --> 38:08.940
- Oh, that's horrible.
- Yeah.

38:11.547 --> 38:13.310
Clark?

38:14.617 --> 38:16.847
Have you seen Lana?

38:17.920 --> 38:20.013
Chloe said she's not ready
to see anyone yet.

38:20.189 --> 38:22.419
Sweetheart, are you all right?

38:23.459 --> 38:25.757
I just can't help thinking that...

38:26.395 --> 38:29.296
...Whitney's skin wasn't bulletproof.

38:29.465 --> 38:32.798
His bones weren't unbreakable,
but he still put himself in harm's way...

38:32.969 --> 38:34.937
...so the world could be safer.

38:35.371 --> 38:39.831
I wonder if I didn't have my abilities,
if I'd have the same kind of courage.

38:49.051 --> 38:51.144
Son, there is no doubt...

38:51.320 --> 38:53.584
...in our minds...

38:53.756 --> 38:55.519
...that you would.

39:22.652 --> 39:23.914
Lex.

39:24.353 --> 39:26.150
What I did was inexcusable.

39:26.555 --> 39:29.956
I violated your privacy.
I should have trusted you.

39:30.126 --> 39:32.253
It's a little late for apologies.

39:32.428 --> 39:33.895
From the time I was born...

39:34.063 --> 39:37.226
...I was raised in an environment
of suspicion and distrust.

39:37.600 --> 39:41.331
My father taught me to regard everyone
as an adversary, no matter who they are.

39:41.504 --> 39:43.995
I'm sorry you had to grow up like that,
I am, but...

39:44.173 --> 39:46.266
When my mother died...

39:46.442 --> 39:49.411
...I began to build a wall around my heart.

39:50.146 --> 39:53.547
Every year that wall grew
taller and more fortified...

39:53.716 --> 39:56.583
...till eventually it became impenetrable.

39:57.453 --> 40:00.718
I want to tear the wall down,
Helen, I do. I just...

40:00.890 --> 40:03.415
I don't have the slightest clue
how to do it.

40:09.665 --> 40:11.292
Lex...

40:11.801 --> 40:16.101
I've never once asked anyone for help,
but I'm asking you now.

40:16.906 --> 40:19.170
Help me, Helen.

40:20.910 --> 40:23.743
I don't want to become my father.

41:14.029 --> 41:15.656
I called your house.

41:15.831 --> 41:18.265
Your mom said you were down here.

41:19.335 --> 41:20.859
I am so sorry.

41:22.571 --> 41:24.869
I never should have sent that video.

41:26.475 --> 41:28.033
Don't do that to yourself.

41:28.811 --> 41:30.676
He was missing in action...

41:30.846 --> 41:33.974
...fighting for his life,
thinking that I wasn't there...

41:34.150 --> 41:35.981
...that I didn't care.

41:36.152 --> 41:37.676
It's not your fault.

41:40.956 --> 41:42.890
Seems like...

41:43.058 --> 41:47.791
...every person that I've ever
gotten close to just leaves.

41:48.931 --> 41:52.389
- That's not true.
- Yeah, it is.

41:53.536 --> 41:56.130
My parents, Nell...

41:56.305 --> 41:57.772
...now Whitney.

42:03.612 --> 42:07.070
I know I haven't been a good friend.

42:09.218 --> 42:12.881
- You've been a great friend.
- No, I have doubted you...

42:13.055 --> 42:17.219
...accused you of things,
and still you're here, protecting me.

42:21.363 --> 42:23.729
I don't care if you have secrets, Clark.

42:24.433 --> 42:30.030
You are the one good, constant thing
in my life, and I don't want to lose you too.

42:34.276 --> 42:36.710
I'm not going anywhere.
