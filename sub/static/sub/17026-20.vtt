Previously on"ER.."

00:05.539 --> 00:07.141
[gunfire]

00:07.208 --> 00:08.342
I told you to get a desk job.

00:08.409 --> 00:10.078
Bastard shot me
in the back.

00:10.144 --> 00:12.413
Lucien, I've withdrawn
my application.

00:12.480 --> 00:14.282
'I'm not staying at County.'

00:14.348 --> 00:18.052
Talking about every stupid damn
thing that-that bothers me? No!

00:19.087 --> 00:20.121
No!

00:20.188 --> 00:23.257
You know, I truly believe

00:23.324 --> 00:26.060
there's something better
out there for both of us.

00:26.127 --> 00:27.561
Better?

00:28.729 --> 00:30.798
Something more right.

00:35.836 --> 00:37.171
[thunder rumbling]

00:43.811 --> 00:45.413
- So.
- So.

00:45.479 --> 00:47.548
- Listen--
- I'm sorry.

00:47.615 --> 00:49.950
- I really didn't--
- I'm sorry things got so weird.

00:50.017 --> 00:52.686
I know I kind of sprung
things on...you.

00:52.753 --> 00:55.723
Okay...you go first.

00:55.789 --> 00:57.758
[sighs]

00:57.825 --> 01:00.361
I know I've been somewhat
closed off about all of this

01:00.428 --> 01:02.696
but I was afraid that
if I discussed it with you

01:02.763 --> 01:05.399
you'd convince me to stay.

01:05.465 --> 01:08.536
Well, I certainly
would have tried.

01:08.602 --> 01:12.072
But, you know what?
It's a good thing you're going.

01:12.140 --> 01:13.741
- It is?
- Yep.

01:13.807 --> 01:17.145
Adjusting to a new environment,
a new way of doing things

01:17.211 --> 01:19.913
you will gain so much
confidence from that.

01:19.980 --> 01:22.116
Oh, but I hope so.

01:23.984 --> 01:25.319
And then when you're sick

01:25.386 --> 01:26.587
of your third-rate
community trauma center--

01:26.654 --> 01:29.390
Oh, now it's third-rate?
Demoted from b-list.

01:29.457 --> 01:31.859
You will always, always,
always have a job here.

01:34.795 --> 01:36.497
- Really?
- Yeah.

01:36.564 --> 01:38.466
Six month, six years,
I don't know.

01:38.532 --> 01:40.501
I'm not sure,
but you will be back.

01:41.935 --> 01:44.272
County is in your blood.

01:46.807 --> 01:50.511
And until then,
my friend, good luck.

01:54.348 --> 01:55.583
Get out of here.

01:55.649 --> 01:56.784
[sighs]

01:59.887 --> 02:04.458
Lucien, I don't know
if I can do this without you.

02:05.193 --> 02:06.994
Of course you can.

02:07.060 --> 02:08.496
You'll see.

02:09.197 --> 02:10.731
You'll see.

02:17.070 --> 02:20.808
Now, go.
Get out of here, please.

02:20.874 --> 02:23.143
Go. Please.

02:57.578 --> 02:59.947
The MRI is gonna tell us
if there's blood in his brain.

03:00.013 --> 03:01.282
That's the hard part.

03:02.583 --> 03:04.184
And if there is,
then what?

03:04.252 --> 03:05.319
Brain surgery?

03:05.386 --> 03:06.887
Possibly.

03:13.227 --> 03:16.564
Jay, I-I know how much
you need to talk to him.

03:16.630 --> 03:20.768
Okay, I'm gonna do everything,
that I can, to make that happen.

03:21.969 --> 03:24.338
Oh, no. He has to wake up.

03:24.405 --> 03:27.775
(Jay)
'Dr. Brenner?
Dr. Brenner? '

03:27.841 --> 03:30.978
(woman on PA)
'Your attention please,
the change of gate announcement'

03:31.044 --> 03:35.883
'for flight J-R-2-3-0-9. This
flight has now been cancelled.'

03:35.949 --> 03:37.985
Hey, where you been?
Frank really outdid himself.

03:38.051 --> 03:40.388
Oh, yeah? I took Mr. Walters
up to the MRI suite.

03:40.454 --> 03:43.291
They're going to try
and squeeze him in.

03:44.925 --> 03:46.694
- What?
- Nothing.

03:48.596 --> 03:49.897
If it does turn out
to be an aneurysm

03:49.963 --> 03:51.899
they can embolize it
if it's caught early.

03:51.965 --> 03:54.802
You don't think Neela noticed
that you weren't there?

03:54.868 --> 03:56.837
I meant to go, but I was
dealing with this neuro--

03:56.904 --> 03:59.573
You couldn't find
five minutes to stop by?

04:08.716 --> 04:11.752
Gates, I'm signing out
to Morris for a while.

04:14.388 --> 04:15.889
It's me. I'm at the airport.

04:15.956 --> 04:19.125
I could really use some
of your sage wisdom right now.

04:19.192 --> 04:21.194
Can you call me,
when you get this.

04:21.261 --> 04:22.830
Thanks. Bye.

04:22.896 --> 04:26.233
- What can I get you?
- Glenfiddich straight, please.

04:26.300 --> 04:29.136
'Need some warming up, do we?'

04:29.202 --> 04:30.838
Off to someplace sunny?

04:30.904 --> 04:33.006
Yes, actually.

04:33.073 --> 04:34.508
'Beach vacation?'

04:35.809 --> 04:38.011
'Business trip?'

04:38.078 --> 04:39.212
Sort of.

04:39.279 --> 04:40.614
Sort of?

04:42.316 --> 04:44.217
It's a new job. I'm moving.

04:44.284 --> 04:45.986
Really? What do you do?

04:47.455 --> 04:49.590
- I, uh--
- 'Neela?'

04:53.260 --> 04:54.995
I couldn't let you go like this.

04:57.465 --> 05:00.601
[theme music]

05:07.140 --> 05:09.176
- What are you drinking?
- Uh, what do you got on tap?

05:09.242 --> 05:10.644
No, uh, forget that.

05:10.711 --> 05:13.146
I'll have soda water with a..

05:13.213 --> 05:14.982
...with a lime. Thanks.

05:16.049 --> 05:17.385
Oh, thank God for the storm

05:17.451 --> 05:20.220
or you'd be somewhere
over Missouri by now.

05:20.287 --> 05:22.856
Geography's pretty good
for a foreigner.

05:25.559 --> 05:29.162
Look, I, um, I just..

05:29.229 --> 05:30.864
...I thought that
if I didn't catch you now

05:30.931 --> 05:34.402
then maybe we'd
never speak again.

05:41.241 --> 05:45.012
Today's been strange
and difficult.

05:45.078 --> 05:47.481
Yeah. Yeah, I know.

05:49.950 --> 05:51.485
For me, too.

06:01.094 --> 06:03.497
Oh, and don't mutter
in Spanish when you're angry.

06:03.564 --> 06:05.032
It's a cliche.

06:05.098 --> 06:06.967
I understand a lot more
than you think I understand.

06:07.034 --> 06:10.370
Fine! You win. I'll stay home
with my hair in curlers

06:10.438 --> 06:11.772
spending my days
knitting and baking.

06:11.839 --> 06:13.373
You know that that's not
what I'm talking about.

06:13.441 --> 06:15.242
No, no, honey, what would you
like? Apple pie or cherry?

06:15.308 --> 06:16.877
Come on! If you just listen
to what I'm actually saying--

06:16.944 --> 06:19.613
Give it up, Archie.
This conversation is over.

06:19.680 --> 06:22.783
Well, well, okay!
Have a great day!

06:22.850 --> 06:25.018
And, and please accept
my sincere apology

06:25.085 --> 06:27.721
for giving a rat's ass!

06:27.788 --> 06:30.023
- Everything okay?
- Everything's fine.

06:30.090 --> 06:31.291
What've we got?

06:31.358 --> 06:34.094
Uh, one storey fall with LOC.
That's all I know.

06:35.763 --> 06:37.197
What the hell is that?

06:37.264 --> 06:39.933
Uh, it's a little something
for Neela. It's her last day.

06:40.000 --> 06:41.802
A pinata?
What is she five?

06:41.869 --> 06:46.106
It's not just any pinata.
I-I had this custom-made.

06:46.173 --> 06:47.441
It's a Gandhi pinata.

06:47.508 --> 06:49.510
That is scary.

06:49.577 --> 06:51.311
Ha-ha not to mention offensive.

06:51.378 --> 06:54.314
Yeah, who's gonna want to bash
Gandhi's head in with a bat?

06:54.381 --> 06:55.916
You have no sense of culture.

06:57.685 --> 06:59.186
Gary Walters, 53.

06:59.252 --> 07:02.155
Fell head first down a flight
of stairs after a few too many.

07:02.222 --> 07:03.657
'I slipped on the rug.'

07:03.724 --> 07:05.959
Observed LOC, awake
at the scene, but disoriented.

07:06.026 --> 07:07.595
Mr. Walters, do you know
what day it is?

07:07.661 --> 07:09.663
I told you,
I slipped on the rug.

07:09.730 --> 07:11.031
Okay, Gates,
what do you want?

07:11.098 --> 07:13.867
Uh, head CT,
C-spine, trauma labs

07:13.934 --> 07:15.769
tox screen,
and an ETOH level.

07:15.836 --> 07:17.104
- I'm on it.
- Good.

07:17.170 --> 07:18.138
And, uh, get him to surgery

07:18.205 --> 07:19.206
they're gonna need to see him.

07:19.272 --> 07:21.475
Neela's already
on the floor.

07:21.542 --> 07:23.243
She's clotting,
how's the CBC?

07:23.310 --> 07:24.878
- First one was good.
- The tides have changed.

07:24.945 --> 07:26.379
- Send the repeat now.
- Does anything hurt you, ma'am?

07:26.446 --> 07:27.948
Gravity is the horse's force.

07:28.015 --> 07:29.382
(Neela)
Do you remember
what happened today?

07:29.449 --> 07:30.584
'Nobody'll listen.'

07:30.651 --> 07:31.919
She drove her motorcycle
into the museum

07:31.985 --> 07:33.253
of science and industry,
warning people

07:33.320 --> 07:34.522
about the end of the world.

07:34.588 --> 07:35.923
- Psych history?
- Yeah, so it seems.

07:35.989 --> 07:37.591
I'll check and see
if she has a record here.

07:37.658 --> 07:39.727
- 'Equilibrium is shifting.'
- Oh, for you, too?

07:39.793 --> 07:40.861
I thought that was
just me on account

07:40.928 --> 07:42.029
of it being my
last day here.

07:42.095 --> 07:43.631
It's Claudia's
first day back at work.

07:43.697 --> 07:45.165
- 'Good for her.'
- Is it?

07:45.232 --> 07:46.834
I mean,
I'm not sure it is.

07:46.900 --> 07:48.902
LFTs and lipase are normal.

07:48.969 --> 07:51.438
I think, ma'am, you might
be my last surgical case.

07:51.505 --> 07:53.907
I thought I was okay with it.
You know, I really did.

07:53.974 --> 07:55.909
It's her job and I respect that.

07:55.976 --> 07:57.911
But she got shot.

07:57.978 --> 07:59.847
Now why couldn't I fall for a
nice librarian or something?

07:59.913 --> 08:02.082
You know, a librarian
in Springfield died last month.

08:02.149 --> 08:04.284
'Bookshelf fell on her.'

08:04.351 --> 08:05.619
I swear, it's in the paper.

08:05.686 --> 08:07.087
Guys, we need a surgeon in here.

08:07.154 --> 08:10.490
Andrew, check the tox screen
and let Dubenko know

08:10.558 --> 08:12.626
we've got a possible
laparotomy.

08:13.827 --> 08:15.696
- What have you got?
- 53-year-old male.

08:15.763 --> 08:17.064
Fell down a staircase.

08:17.130 --> 08:19.232
Multiple contusions to head,
hip and back.

08:19.299 --> 08:20.934
32 French
and draw up some Lido.

08:21.001 --> 08:22.803
Decreased on the left
with SATs in the 80's.

08:22.870 --> 08:25.973
Hello, I'm Dr. Rasgotra.
Do you remember falling?

08:26.039 --> 08:28.576
I was dizzy.
I guess I tripped.

08:28.642 --> 08:30.744
Smells like ETOH
was involved.

08:30.811 --> 08:32.980
Belly's benign, but I figured
you'd want to sign off.

08:33.046 --> 08:34.682
Oh, happy to help.

08:34.748 --> 08:36.515
(female #1)
'Oh, thank God.'

08:36.583 --> 08:38.986
- I'm fine.
- You're not fine!

08:39.052 --> 08:41.855
Just a few scrapes. And this
headache won't go away.

08:41.922 --> 08:43.256
Alright,
little pinch here.

08:43.323 --> 08:44.524
What are you doing?

08:44.592 --> 08:45.759
Well, he may have broken a rib

08:45.826 --> 08:48.061
when he fell, punctured a lung.

08:48.128 --> 08:50.363
- The tube will inflate it.
- When is this gonna stop?

08:50.430 --> 08:52.600
- It's not even 10:00 a.m.
- Hey, mom, don't start.

08:52.666 --> 08:54.635
I woke up this morning
with a headache.

08:54.702 --> 08:55.936
It's called a hangover.

08:56.003 --> 08:57.671
I just needed a little
something for the pain.

08:57.738 --> 08:59.640
He's a drunk, huh,
but you've probably

08:59.707 --> 09:00.941
figured that out by now.

09:01.008 --> 09:02.542
Come on. Let the doctors work.

09:02.610 --> 09:03.711
Two people ahead
of us for CT.

09:03.777 --> 09:05.278
Type and cross and let me know

09:05.345 --> 09:06.947
when the scan is back, please.

09:07.014 --> 09:08.782
Excuse, sorry, uh, my mother's

09:08.849 --> 09:10.517
been through some messy stuff.

09:10.584 --> 09:12.119
No worries.

09:14.588 --> 09:17.725
(Neela)
We all have messes
in our past.

09:17.791 --> 09:19.126
I shouldn't have
been so hard on you

09:19.192 --> 09:21.128
it wasn't the best way
to end things, really.

09:21.194 --> 09:22.395
You were right.

09:22.462 --> 09:26.133
I was righteous. Which isn't my
best quality, honestly.

09:27.300 --> 09:30.804
For my whole adult life,
I've been doing..

09:31.739 --> 09:33.273
...exactly what you said.

09:34.675 --> 09:36.343
I'm not sure
what you mean.

09:36.409 --> 09:38.078
Disappearing.

09:39.647 --> 09:42.115
Using sex as an escape.

09:42.182 --> 09:46.620
Or worse, as a weapon,
a way of disarming people.

09:46.687 --> 09:48.021
' Look at you two.'

09:48.088 --> 09:51.424
So sweet. Like nobody
else is in the room.

09:51.491 --> 09:52.660
You want another round?

09:52.726 --> 09:55.629
- Uh...sure.
- Yeah.

10:01.902 --> 10:04.137
I'm in.
O-silk, Elastoplast.

10:04.204 --> 10:06.573
I'll get the thoroseal.

10:06.640 --> 10:08.608
Hey, guys, look.

10:08.676 --> 10:11.244
Irregular rhythm,
looks like A-fib.

10:11.311 --> 10:12.713
Nice pickup.

10:12.780 --> 10:14.815
Do you have a history
of atrial fibrillation?

10:14.882 --> 10:17.617
He didn't tell you?
You didn't tell them?

10:17.685 --> 10:19.319
I don't know. I forgot.

10:19.386 --> 10:20.587
Forgot?
That's a load of crap.

10:20.654 --> 10:21.922
It's okay.

10:21.989 --> 10:23.490
What meds is he on?

10:23.556 --> 10:25.092
Uh, calcium blockers

10:25.158 --> 10:27.160
and-and some other
pill to thin his blood.

10:27.227 --> 10:28.495
Coumadin.

10:28.561 --> 10:30.230
He's bad
about taking his meds.

10:30.297 --> 10:31.398
He drinks. He forgets.

10:31.464 --> 10:32.833
Or at least that's what he says.

10:32.900 --> 10:34.668
But really, it's a death wish.

10:34.735 --> 10:36.303
He thinks if he doesn't
take his pills

10:36.369 --> 10:38.138
he'll figure out a way
to disappear.

10:38.205 --> 10:40.240
Don't talk about me
like I'm not here.

10:40.307 --> 10:44.778
Today, of all days,
you couldn't control yourself?

10:45.679 --> 10:47.715
What's so special about today?

10:47.781 --> 10:49.850
- It's been ten years--
- Oh, here we go.

10:49.917 --> 10:52.252
He has this pathetic
need to tell everyone.

10:52.319 --> 10:53.821
Mom, please.

10:59.326 --> 11:01.862
Um, today is the anniversary
of their son's death

11:01.929 --> 11:04.732
so everyone's a bit...tense.

11:06.599 --> 11:08.268
My dad blames himself.

11:08.335 --> 11:10.270
I let Timmy go.

11:10.337 --> 11:12.139
I'll be outside.

11:15.075 --> 11:16.143
'Mom.'

11:16.209 --> 11:18.478
Sam, add an INR and rush
the head scan, please.

11:18.545 --> 11:22.750
I keep thinking it's
gonna get easier...doesn't.

11:25.285 --> 11:26.619
(Neela)
'Hey, we've got
a staircase fall in one'

11:26.686 --> 11:27.988
with a pneumo and a headache

11:28.055 --> 11:29.957
and motorcycle crash
in two with a seat belt sign.

11:30.023 --> 11:32.625
Okay, sounds good. Who do
you want me to see first?

11:32.692 --> 11:34.094
Well, motorcycle girl
looks like she might

11:34.161 --> 11:35.695
need the OR,
and you know what?

11:35.763 --> 11:37.430
- What?
- This'll be case number 2,500.

11:37.497 --> 11:39.967
- 2,500? No way.
- Yeah, can you believe it?

11:40.033 --> 11:43.270
I have logged 2,499
surgeries since internship.

11:43.336 --> 11:45.005
Well, that's impressive.

11:45.072 --> 11:46.473
- Serial crits?
- Not back yet.

11:46.539 --> 11:49.943
Ah, surgeons perfect timing.
I have a question for you.

11:50.010 --> 11:52.512
- How is she doing?
- FAST is negative. CBC's good.

11:52.579 --> 11:53.847
Hi, I'm Dr. Dubenko.

11:53.914 --> 11:55.816
- Reckoning is here!
- Okay.

11:55.883 --> 11:57.384
Uh, why are
eschatological delusions

11:57.450 --> 11:59.052
so common among
psychotic patients?

11:59.119 --> 12:00.854
- Escha what?
- Eschatology.

12:00.921 --> 12:02.956
Pertaining to the end
of the world.

12:03.023 --> 12:05.358
I checked the records. No psych
hospitalizations at county.

12:05.425 --> 12:07.327
Oh, she definitely doesn't
look familiar.

12:07.394 --> 12:08.996
There's no hiding
from the fifth cycle.

12:09.062 --> 12:10.864
Okay. Sweet dreams, my dear.

12:10.931 --> 12:12.599
So, your girlfriend
gets shot on the job.

12:12.665 --> 12:13.700
- Uh-huh.
- Okay.

12:13.767 --> 12:15.168
And seeing that
you care about her

12:15.235 --> 12:16.669
and want her to
I don't know, not die.

12:16.736 --> 12:18.738
You gently suggest that
she might do another job.

12:18.806 --> 12:19.940
- Is that sexist?
- No.

12:20.007 --> 12:20.974
- Yes.
- No.

12:21.041 --> 12:22.109
- Yeah.
- No, no.

12:22.175 --> 12:23.376
- Tomato, tomahto.
- What?

12:23.443 --> 12:24.812
Rigid abdomen,
probably needs the OR.

12:24.878 --> 12:25.913
Andrew, you can
scrub in on this.

12:25.979 --> 12:27.614
Awesome.
She's seizing.

12:27.680 --> 12:29.282
- Look out.
- I see that.

12:29.349 --> 12:31.151
- Two of Ativan.
- Crank up the O2.

12:31.218 --> 12:32.685
Haldol lowers
the seizure threshold.

12:32.752 --> 12:34.154
Call me when she's ready
for the scanner.

12:34.221 --> 12:35.923
I'll swing by and take a look.
Andrew, let's go.

12:35.989 --> 12:37.724
Do you want me to
stay back and cover the ER?

12:37.791 --> 12:39.126
No, forget about the ER.
Meet us upstairs.

12:39.192 --> 12:41.895
You've got to log
case number 2,500.

12:41.962 --> 12:43.864
What's with him?

12:43.931 --> 12:47.134
(Neela)
Denial. Avoidance.

12:49.402 --> 12:50.971
Fear.

12:53.273 --> 12:55.375
There's so many things
I've missed out on

12:55.442 --> 12:56.844
'cause I was afraid.

12:57.911 --> 12:58.912
Well, you're obviously
not afraid

12:58.979 --> 13:00.948
to fly in really bad weather.

13:01.949 --> 13:03.283
[chuckles]

13:06.019 --> 13:09.957
You know, when I
was six, my, um..

13:10.023 --> 13:13.326
...aunt took me to a toy store
and gave me five pounds

13:13.393 --> 13:16.196
and said I could buy
anything I wanted.

13:16.263 --> 13:19.199
I wandered around the store
for what seemed like hours

13:19.266 --> 13:20.868
terrified that I'd
choose the wrong thing.

13:20.934 --> 13:22.903
Wrong doll my
sister would laugh.

13:22.970 --> 13:25.538
Wrong book,
my brothers would take it.

13:25.605 --> 13:28.976
Wrong teddy, the kids at school
would think I was a baby.

13:31.311 --> 13:33.213
I left the store
with nothing.

13:35.248 --> 13:38.785
My father put the money
in the bank.

13:38.852 --> 13:42.122
- Sensible kid.
- Well, the point is..

13:43.323 --> 13:44.691
...is that, for as long
as I can remember

13:44.757 --> 13:48.862
I've carried this irrational
dread of making a mistake.

13:49.930 --> 13:53.566
It's with me
all the time.

13:53.633 --> 13:55.936
And-and why on earth

13:56.003 --> 13:57.637
I decided to become a doctor

13:57.704 --> 14:03.210
where the cost of a mistake
is so high, it's insane.

14:03.276 --> 14:06.146
- Yeah, it's masochistic.
- I know.

14:09.349 --> 14:13.420
This is all my way of saying I,
I know I helped screw things up.

14:14.854 --> 14:17.024
I'm not following.

14:18.591 --> 14:21.361
Well, just..

14:21.428 --> 14:24.797
[sighs]
...so many times
in my life, I've

14:24.864 --> 14:26.499
I've failed to take a chance.

14:28.268 --> 14:30.637
Even when it was clear
to everyone else

14:30.703 --> 14:33.340
including me,
that I should have.

14:36.977 --> 14:37.945
That's why I got to go

14:38.011 --> 14:40.747
I, you know, even if it's..

14:40.813 --> 14:42.882
...scares the hell out of me.
I just don't want to be

14:42.950 --> 14:45.318
that person anymore, you know.

14:47.054 --> 14:48.455
Me, either.

14:51.824 --> 14:53.193
Don't worry, Neela.

14:53.260 --> 14:56.296
I'm not here to try
and convince you to stay.

15:08.741 --> 15:11.044
Then why are you here?

15:15.115 --> 15:17.484
I really-really don't know.

15:19.086 --> 15:21.321
[chuckles]

15:21.388 --> 15:23.023
You know, how did you
get past security?

15:23.090 --> 15:25.425
Don't you have
to have a ticket?

15:28.095 --> 15:29.796
You bought a ticket.

15:29.862 --> 15:32.165
So, you got any,
um, good ideas

15:32.232 --> 15:34.701
of things to
do in Detroit?

15:34.767 --> 15:36.203
Detroit?

15:36.269 --> 15:38.638
Yeah, well, it
was the only way.

15:45.112 --> 15:47.147
It just seemed wrong.

15:47.214 --> 15:49.049
Just seemed
terribly wrong

15:49.116 --> 15:52.052
to let you go and
not even say goodbye.

15:59.759 --> 16:02.262
Do you want to take a walk?

16:07.434 --> 16:10.370
Head looks good,
Mr. Walters, no bleeding.

16:10.437 --> 16:11.638
Yeah.

16:11.704 --> 16:13.606
You didn't need
to stay for this.

16:13.673 --> 16:15.175
I know.
I wanted to.

16:16.343 --> 16:19.079
Jay was my boy's best friend.

16:20.880 --> 16:22.815
He pulled Tim out of the water.

16:22.882 --> 16:24.384
Did CPR for an hour

16:24.451 --> 16:26.986
'till the
Coast Guard got there.'

16:27.987 --> 16:29.522
Let's not go there, okay?

16:30.823 --> 16:32.525
After the funeral

16:32.592 --> 16:34.294
everyone got on
with their lives.

16:34.361 --> 16:37.397
But Jay came by every day
just to check on us.

16:37.464 --> 16:39.832
That was just an excuse
to flirt with your daughter.

16:39.899 --> 16:41.034
Well, looks
like it worked.

16:41.101 --> 16:43.570
I've been married
three years now.

16:43.636 --> 16:45.572
I lost Tim.

16:45.638 --> 16:48.007
'But you became
like a son to me.'

16:48.075 --> 16:50.210
Alright, alright.

16:50.277 --> 16:52.279
At least you're
affectionate when you're drunk.

16:52.345 --> 16:53.713
(Lucien)
'What, are you guys
having a party in here?'

16:53.780 --> 16:54.747
'We need the scanner.'

16:54.814 --> 16:56.015
Hello, mister..

16:56.083 --> 16:57.250
Walters.

16:57.317 --> 16:58.285
How are you feeling?

16:58.351 --> 17:00.353
My head's killing me.

17:00.420 --> 17:03.223
But the, uh,
CT is clear.

17:03.290 --> 17:04.624
No bleed, no edema?

17:04.691 --> 17:06.959
- Who is that?
- Uh, the other case.

17:07.026 --> 17:08.395
Staircase fall.

17:08.461 --> 17:11.231
Uh, did you think
of tapping him?

17:11.298 --> 17:12.699
Uh, tap him? Why?

17:12.765 --> 17:14.534
Well, I don't want to miss
a subarachnoid bleed.

17:14.601 --> 17:16.903
Could be the cause of his
symptoms and not show up on CT.

17:16.969 --> 17:18.238
Well, that-that's pretty rare.

17:18.305 --> 17:19.539
Extremely rare.

17:19.606 --> 17:21.040
I know, but the cause
of his dizziness

17:21.108 --> 17:22.075
the headache before the fall--

17:22.142 --> 17:23.609
Well, he was drinking.

17:23.675 --> 17:25.811
Well, his ETOH level
wasn't all that high

17:25.877 --> 17:27.146
not for chronic
alcoholic.

17:27.214 --> 17:29.749
We don't tap
all our negative CTs.

17:29.816 --> 17:32.185
Well, if it was
up to me, we would.

17:32.252 --> 17:35.155
Let's not risk missing
something we could fix.

17:36.689 --> 17:37.857
You on board with this?

17:37.924 --> 17:39.492
Me? I-I trust her instincts.

17:39.559 --> 17:42.562
She's going to be her own boss
starting tomorrow, so..

17:42.629 --> 17:44.731
'Don't have
much leverage, really.'

17:47.033 --> 17:49.068
The ad said,
snake charmer.

17:49.136 --> 17:50.337
I brought
Tarantulas, too

17:50.403 --> 17:51.771
if you think
she'd prefer that.

17:51.838 --> 17:54.774
No, I was thinking of
a-a turban and a flute

17:54.841 --> 17:56.909
and a-a snake in a basket.

17:56.976 --> 17:59.679
Not this S and M get up.

17:59.746 --> 18:01.013
People dig the outfit.

18:01.080 --> 18:02.115
It won't work.

18:02.182 --> 18:03.650
Go.

18:06.719 --> 18:08.888
Here.

18:08.955 --> 18:11.090
For your trouble.

18:14.694 --> 18:16.095
What was that?

18:16.163 --> 18:17.664
Ah, you know, when
Neela first got here

18:17.730 --> 18:19.499
we kind of got off
on the wrong foot.

18:19.566 --> 18:21.868
I said some things
I shouldn't have said

18:21.934 --> 18:24.204
about her ethnic
background and..

18:24.271 --> 18:26.239
Oh, Frank, come on.
That was six years ago.

18:26.306 --> 18:27.507
I'm sure
she's over it.

18:27.574 --> 18:29.242
Well, I would just
like to show her

18:29.309 --> 18:30.777
how much I
have changed.

18:30.843 --> 18:33.846
Why don't you try something
simple, like flowers?

18:33.913 --> 18:35.382
- Flowers?
- Yeah.

18:35.448 --> 18:39.252
Well, that's not even
remotely original or cultural.

18:39.319 --> 18:41.188
Just because her
parents were born in India

18:41.254 --> 18:42.322
doesn't mean she's
going to appreciate

18:42.389 --> 18:43.723
some kind
of Indian cliche.

18:43.790 --> 18:47.093
In fact, she may
very well find it offensive.

18:47.160 --> 18:49.362
What?

18:49.429 --> 18:51.798
She's English, Frank.

18:51.864 --> 18:54.100
Okay, so
a Gandhi pinata

18:54.167 --> 18:56.203
or a turbaned snake charmer

18:56.269 --> 18:58.338
is gonna end up
working against you here.

18:58.405 --> 18:59.639
Well, thank you, Sam.

18:59.706 --> 19:02.609
I'll take that
under advisement.

19:05.111 --> 19:06.246
No free fluid.

19:06.313 --> 19:07.814
- Aorta's intact.
- And the IVC.

19:07.880 --> 19:09.649
- Kidneys look functional.
- As do the ureters.

19:09.716 --> 19:11.418
I know how to read
an abdominal scan.

19:11.484 --> 19:13.486
- Of course you do.
- What's going on?

19:13.553 --> 19:15.388
Make sure the head's clear.
I'll meet you in the OR.

19:15.455 --> 19:16.923
The OR? But the scan's perfect.

19:16.989 --> 19:18.758
She's got a rigid abdomen.
It's surgical.

19:18.825 --> 19:20.293
Doesn't matter
what the scan says.

19:20.360 --> 19:22.262
Her vitals are good.
Her counts are unchanged.

19:22.329 --> 19:23.663
Why not watch her in the ICU

19:23.730 --> 19:25.532
'move her at the
first sign of instability?'

19:25.598 --> 19:27.099
Because, by then,
she'll be unstable.

19:27.166 --> 19:28.368
Lucien, you--

19:28.435 --> 19:30.970
Small bowel perforation,
mesenteric injury.

19:31.037 --> 19:34.574
Let's not risk missing
something we can fix. Right?

19:34.641 --> 19:36.743
Meet you in the OR in ten.

19:38.978 --> 19:42.382
Sometimes there can be a head
bleed which we can't see on CT.

19:42.449 --> 19:43.850
A more sensitive test

19:43.916 --> 19:46.253
is to place a small needle
into the spinal canal

19:46.319 --> 19:47.987
and remove some fluid.

19:48.054 --> 19:50.122
If the lab finds
red blood cells

19:50.189 --> 19:51.224
then we know there's a problem.

19:51.291 --> 19:53.125
What are the risks?

19:53.192 --> 19:55.428
Infection and bleeding
are the main ones, but we'll

19:55.495 --> 19:57.464
we'll take precautions
to avoid both.

19:58.565 --> 19:59.732
What do you think, Jay?

20:01.534 --> 20:05.872
Alright, you know what, fluoro's
here so we should step out.

20:05.938 --> 20:07.874
Hang in there, dad.

20:07.940 --> 20:11.911
Dr. Brenner,
no disrespect but, uh..

20:11.978 --> 20:13.145
This is stupid.

20:13.212 --> 20:14.814
Look, his mental status
is getting worse.

20:14.881 --> 20:16.383
We don't have a
good explanation.

20:16.449 --> 20:18.184
Subarachnoid bleed is
a reasonable theory.

20:18.251 --> 20:19.519
Except for the fact
that he's on Coumadin

20:19.586 --> 20:20.720
which means
the chance of creating

20:20.787 --> 20:22.355
bleeding complications
is much higher

20:22.422 --> 20:23.490
than even finding a problem.

20:23.556 --> 20:25.157
His INR is less than two.

20:25.224 --> 20:26.426
Clearly, there
is something subtle

20:26.493 --> 20:27.994
that led Neela
to ask for this.

20:28.060 --> 20:30.930
Yeah, it's her last day. She
doesn't want to make a mistake.

20:30.997 --> 20:32.399
But she'll feel
just as bad

20:32.465 --> 20:34.967
if the procedure leads to an
uncontrollable spinal bleed.

20:35.034 --> 20:36.503
Got your LP kit.

20:37.970 --> 20:40.973
I'm not gonna do it.

20:41.040 --> 20:42.141
We'll use fluoro, give FFP.

20:42.208 --> 20:43.310
It will be fine.

20:43.376 --> 20:44.911
You will be there
to assist.

20:44.977 --> 20:46.279
(Neela)
'Maybe we can go in
laproscopically'

20:46.346 --> 20:47.314
have a quick look.

20:47.380 --> 20:48.548
We'll be doing
it open.

20:48.615 --> 20:49.949
Her recovery time
would be so much easier.

20:50.016 --> 20:52.218
I'm aware of the
advantages of laparoscopy.

20:52.285 --> 20:53.620
Well, serial
ultrasounds are fine.

20:53.686 --> 20:55.555
Normal CT, vitals are good.
Crit is stable.

20:55.622 --> 20:58.758
You're the one who wanted
to log 2,500 surgeries.

20:58.825 --> 21:01.294
Don't rush a patient's surgery
because you're mad at me.

21:01.361 --> 21:02.329
I'm not mad
at you.

21:02.395 --> 21:03.763
I'm amused by your narcissism

21:03.830 --> 21:06.366
but the patient
has a surgical abdomen, okay?

21:06.433 --> 21:08.167
I suggest, perhaps,
that it is your judgment

21:08.234 --> 21:10.670
that's been clouded by the
significance of the day.

21:10.737 --> 21:11.738
Lucien, please.

21:11.804 --> 21:14.140
Why don't you just say
what you need to say?

21:14.206 --> 21:15.608
I don't need to say anything.

21:15.675 --> 21:17.444
You know, one minute,
you're strange and loopy.

21:17.510 --> 21:19.979
The next, you're
gritting your teeth.

21:20.046 --> 21:21.881
Look, it isn't personal.

21:23.082 --> 21:25.051
Maybe you can just wish me luck.

21:25.117 --> 21:26.853
I'd like to, but I can't.

21:26.919 --> 21:28.455
What? I can't
accept the fact

21:28.521 --> 21:30.189
that you've accepted a
job at an academically

21:30.256 --> 21:32.792
and clinically inferior
institution just to spite me.

21:32.859 --> 21:34.694
Oh, now who's being
a narcissist?

21:34.761 --> 21:36.563
(Andrew)
Patient is prepped.
Ancef is running.

21:36.629 --> 21:38.831
I can't wish you luck
because I want you to hate it.

21:38.898 --> 21:39.832
You're unbelievable.

21:39.899 --> 21:41.434
I haven't spent
all these years

21:41.501 --> 21:42.935
helping you to become
this incredible talent

21:43.002 --> 21:44.704
just so you could move away
to a second-rate city

21:44.771 --> 21:46.639
and work at a
B-list institution.

21:46.706 --> 21:48.508
- '10-blade to Dr. Wade.'
- Sweet.

21:48.575 --> 21:50.009
It's not B-list.
You're being a snob.

21:50.076 --> 21:51.711
You know you're better
than that place.

21:51.778 --> 21:53.112
They have a busy trauma service

21:53.179 --> 21:54.914
and a catchment area
that extends over half a state.

21:54.981 --> 21:56.416
Come on.
No medical school, no research.

21:56.483 --> 21:57.584
Which allows me
to have my time

21:57.650 --> 21:58.751
in the OR
instead of a lab.

21:58.818 --> 22:00.487
Why can't you
respect that?

22:00.553 --> 22:02.622
I'd just imagined
something better for you.

22:02.689 --> 22:04.824
No, it's not what
you imagined for you.

22:04.891 --> 22:07.827
Which is fine,
but it's my life.

22:07.894 --> 22:09.929
You know, if I stay here,
I'll always be your protegee.

22:09.996 --> 22:11.163
'Little Neela.'

22:11.230 --> 22:12.865
It's time to move on.

22:12.932 --> 22:16.569
What the hell are you doing?
You just contaminated yourself.

22:18.571 --> 22:19.872
Hyperpigmentation.

22:19.939 --> 22:22.475
- Starting the incision.
- Andrew, wait, stop.

22:22.542 --> 22:24.210
Go and run and get
the Wood's lamp.

22:24.276 --> 22:26.646
- Why?
- Just get it! Go now!

22:28.114 --> 22:30.450
- Bingo.
- Wow.

22:30.517 --> 22:31.951
- 'Hey, what the hell?'
- 'Call Heme.'

22:32.018 --> 22:34.120
- They'll need to admit her.
- Heme?

22:34.186 --> 22:35.555
This woman doesn't
have an internal bleed.

22:35.622 --> 22:37.457
- She has acute porphyria.
- What?

22:37.524 --> 22:39.926
Disorder of the heme
synthesis pathway.

22:39.992 --> 22:42.629
Rigid abdomen, hyperpigmentation
on the extremities

22:42.695 --> 22:44.731
psychosis, seizures,
it all fits.

22:44.797 --> 22:47.366
Yeah, she's the right age
for first presentation.

22:47.434 --> 22:48.835
Okay, reverse the anesthesia.

22:48.901 --> 22:50.837
'She doesn't
need surgery.'

22:50.903 --> 22:52.038
I guess..

22:53.205 --> 22:56.709
2,499 will have to be enough.

23:01.313 --> 23:03.282
That's a big needle.

23:03.349 --> 23:08.154
Yeah, well, if we've done our
job right he won't feel a thing.

23:10.222 --> 23:11.891
You do a lot
for their family.

23:11.958 --> 23:13.826
I've no choice.
I married into it.

23:13.893 --> 23:15.428
Yeah, Lily's
worth it, though.

23:15.495 --> 23:17.396
(Simon)
'That's better. I'm in.'

23:21.468 --> 23:23.402
I don't feel right.

23:23.470 --> 23:25.838
Hold on. Almost done.

23:25.905 --> 23:27.774
- Gary, you okay?
- Take the needle out!

23:27.840 --> 23:29.509
- I'm almost done.
- Take the needle out, Brenner!

23:29.576 --> 23:33.212
- He's bradying down!
- Damn it! Another unit of FFP.

23:33.279 --> 23:36.082
Mr. Walters?
Mr. Walters!

23:36.148 --> 23:38.718
- Alright, Jay, talk to him!
- 'His heart rate is 48.'

23:38.785 --> 23:40.152
- Wake up! Do you hear me!
- Mig of atropine

23:40.219 --> 23:42.254
- 'And transcutaneous pacers.'
- 'Atropine in.'

23:42.321 --> 23:44.657
Chase it with an amp of epi.
I've lost the pulse.

23:44.724 --> 23:45.958
Oh, my God, what's happening?

23:46.025 --> 23:48.595
His heart is beating
dangerously slow.

23:48.661 --> 23:50.229
It could be a vagal reflex
or something to do with

23:50.296 --> 23:51.698
'what's going on in his brain.'

23:51.764 --> 23:53.800
(Tony)
'Overdosed on
calcium blockers?'

23:53.866 --> 23:56.068
Good call. Let's get 500
of calcium gluconate.

23:56.135 --> 23:57.570
Don't do this!

23:57.637 --> 23:59.371
Atropine and let's
sit up for a Doppler infusion.

23:59.438 --> 24:01.073
- Alright, let's pace him.
- 'It was a fight, okay?'

24:01.140 --> 24:02.542
It was a stupid fight!

24:02.609 --> 24:04.977
Increase the voltage. We need
another set of hands in here!

24:05.044 --> 24:06.979
I meant to tell you so many
times it's not what you think.

24:07.046 --> 24:08.781
- No capture.
- Increase the volume.

24:08.848 --> 24:10.449
Look, it's not what you think
though. He slipped.

24:10.517 --> 24:11.618
He slipped,
and it was an accident!

24:11.684 --> 24:12.985
Alright, quiet!

24:15.922 --> 24:17.056
We got capture.

24:21.393 --> 24:23.095
It's a strong carotid.

24:23.162 --> 24:24.664
This is good.

24:27.934 --> 24:29.068
I'm sorry.

24:30.970 --> 24:33.139
I'll go let the
family know he's okay.

24:35.307 --> 24:37.977
Jay, what's going on?

24:42.549 --> 24:43.850
(Brenner)
I met a man today

24:43.916 --> 24:46.418
who accidentally killed
his best friend.

24:46.485 --> 24:47.754
That's awful.

24:47.820 --> 24:49.321
They were on the boat

24:49.388 --> 24:52.324
and they got into
a fight over a girl.

24:52.391 --> 24:54.426
And the guy
punched his friend

24:54.493 --> 24:56.629
and he tripped
and fell overboard.

24:56.696 --> 24:58.798
And that-that was that.

24:58.865 --> 25:01.634
They brought the
friend to the ER?

25:01.701 --> 25:04.470
This happened
ten years ago.

25:04.537 --> 25:05.638
The guy never
told that family

25:05.705 --> 25:08.207
the truth until today.

25:08.274 --> 25:10.577
But for years, though..

25:10.643 --> 25:12.879
Well, their lives
just stopped.

25:13.780 --> 25:16.215
- It's sad.
- Yeah.

25:24.957 --> 25:28.761
Thank you for helping me
see that I was stuck, too.

25:28.828 --> 25:31.731
You know, I'm the last person
who should be telling..

25:31.798 --> 25:34.601
Neela, look,
you were right.

25:35.802 --> 25:39.839
I can't love anyone
until I sort some stuff out.

25:42.074 --> 25:45.511
But maybe because of you,
I've started to do that.

25:45.578 --> 25:47.680
Simon..

25:50.783 --> 25:53.285
This is why I came here.

26:00.226 --> 26:02.261
Neela, this really..

26:04.030 --> 26:06.298
God, this mattered
so much to me.

26:08.167 --> 26:09.836
Thank you.

26:11.604 --> 26:14.741
[dramatic music]

26:27.519 --> 26:29.656
Thank you for saying that.

26:38.965 --> 26:40.933
You know, it's
going to be so weird

26:41.000 --> 26:42.301
not to see you all every day.

26:44.070 --> 26:47.006
Frank, the soft collar
ever come down from Central?

26:47.073 --> 26:49.341
- Yes.
- Were you going to tell me?

26:49.408 --> 26:50.777
Or keep me waiting?

26:50.843 --> 26:52.712
I forgot.
So, shoot me!

26:52.779 --> 26:56.348
Don't tempt me.
Could you get it, please?

26:56.415 --> 26:58.250
- No.
- 'No?'

26:58.317 --> 27:00.086
Oh, I'm gonna miss this.

27:01.320 --> 27:03.690
Neela? Morris has
a complicated hand lac

27:03.756 --> 27:04.824
'he wants you to look at.'

27:04.891 --> 27:06.625
Okay, well, might be
my last consult.

27:06.693 --> 27:08.094
(Samantha)
'Curtain three.'

27:08.160 --> 27:10.162
Dr. Rasgotra? Can you lay hands
on my rule-out appy?

27:10.229 --> 27:12.164
Page Andrew.
I have a plane to catch.

27:12.231 --> 27:13.733
Alright, cool.

27:19.171 --> 27:21.573
(Neela)
'Wow, what happened here?'

27:21.640 --> 27:25.111
Oh, Dr. Rasgotra,
This is Ed McDow.

27:25.177 --> 27:28.681
And this is what happens when
a tug-of-war gets out of hand.

27:28.748 --> 27:31.517
Get it?
Out of hand?

27:31.583 --> 27:33.052
'Company picnic.'

27:33.119 --> 27:35.221
The winning team gets
the closed parking for a year.

27:35.287 --> 27:36.455
Wow.

27:36.522 --> 27:38.190
Rope was wrapped around my hand
so tight it went numb.

27:38.257 --> 27:40.292
I didn't even feel it
cutting through the skin.

27:40.359 --> 27:42.995
Well, you're lucky because it
almost took the whole thing off.

27:43.062 --> 27:44.630
I was so focused
on the game, you know.

27:44.697 --> 27:45.965
I just couldn't let go.

27:46.032 --> 27:47.133
I was going
to have Ortho do it

27:47.199 --> 27:49.368
but the edges
approximate nicely

27:49.435 --> 27:52.404
and there's no neurovascular
damage so thought I would.. Ow!

27:52.471 --> 27:55.141
- Did it go through the glove?
- Uh, yes.

27:55.207 --> 27:56.375
Damn it.

27:56.442 --> 27:57.810
I'm sorry.

27:57.877 --> 27:59.912
It's not your fault, really.

27:59.979 --> 28:02.281
I'll be right back.

28:02.348 --> 28:04.116
You know what? You need
to, uh, irrigate that

28:04.183 --> 28:06.085
and go see Employee Health
to make a report.

28:06.152 --> 28:08.054
A large bore needle
is a very low risk.

28:08.120 --> 28:09.088
I know.

28:09.155 --> 28:10.156
But you still need to check
for hepatitis

28:10.222 --> 28:11.623
and HIV serologies
on that guy.

28:11.690 --> 28:13.793
I know! Hey, what's
going on today?

28:13.860 --> 28:16.295
A PCP vigilante chucks
a mayo stand at my head.

28:16.362 --> 28:18.664
A seven-year-old
Republican bit me

28:18.731 --> 28:20.432
while I was
irrigating his lac

28:20.499 --> 28:24.136
and now this..

28:24.203 --> 28:25.637
Oh, my God.

28:25.704 --> 28:27.907
- I am an ass.
- I'm not following.

28:27.974 --> 28:29.108
Dr. Rasgotra,
come with me, please.

28:29.175 --> 28:30.476
Frank, I can't.
I'm gonna be late.

28:30.542 --> 28:32.879
It's important,
I swear.

28:36.248 --> 28:38.484
Frank, I'm be
late for the plane..

28:38.550 --> 28:40.386
Surprise!

28:42.588 --> 28:45.124
[instrumental music]

28:46.425 --> 28:47.794
[laughing]

28:51.463 --> 28:54.000
[cheering]

28:59.505 --> 29:00.472
It's amazing!

29:00.539 --> 29:01.540
Frank did it all.

29:01.607 --> 29:03.142
- 'Wow!'
- Thank you.

29:03.209 --> 29:04.376
Admit it,
you thought we forgot.

29:04.443 --> 29:05.377
No.

29:05.444 --> 29:07.780
- Or didn't care?
- Well, maybe.

29:07.847 --> 29:09.248
How could you think that?

29:09.315 --> 29:12.184
Nobody stands up to our
bonehead attendings like you do.

29:12.251 --> 29:14.120
Who's going to get all
the tough central lines?

29:14.186 --> 29:16.222
Or chew out the lazy
radiology residents?

29:16.288 --> 29:19.325
Or teach me how to do,
like, everything?

29:19.391 --> 29:20.426
To Neela!

29:20.492 --> 29:23.062
(in unison)
Neela!

29:23.129 --> 29:24.096
Haleh?

29:26.432 --> 29:29.335
I think this is what
you were looking for.

29:40.479 --> 29:42.348
I didn't know if this wall
really existed

29:42.414 --> 29:43.950
or if it was just a rumor.

29:44.016 --> 29:45.784
I knew this day would come.

29:45.852 --> 29:48.254
- But so soon?
- Stop it, Haleh.

29:48.320 --> 29:50.322
You'll make me cry.

29:54.326 --> 29:55.461
[dramatic music]

29:57.329 --> 29:58.865
(Neela)
Excuse me.
Can you help me, sir?

29:58.931 --> 30:00.532
You need to find a triage nurse.

30:00.599 --> 30:03.535
- No, I'm sorry, I work here.
- Lucky you.

30:03.602 --> 30:04.736
Uh, I'm supposed
to start today.

30:04.803 --> 30:06.405
Neela Rasgotra.

30:06.472 --> 30:07.806
Rag what?

30:10.776 --> 30:13.913
[dramatic music]

30:18.951 --> 30:21.921
(Lucien)
You're a really
good surgeon, Neela.

30:21.988 --> 30:24.390
A few more years
and you could be great.

30:27.359 --> 30:28.494
Thank you.

30:39.805 --> 30:41.807
(Abby)
I was wondering you,
If you didn't mind too much

30:41.874 --> 30:43.375
do you think you could
lead the way

30:43.442 --> 30:46.245
and stand up there with me
when we do this?

30:48.014 --> 30:49.882
Do you mean, uh..

30:49.949 --> 30:51.350
Like, be your maid of honor?

30:53.485 --> 30:56.822
I'd be honored.

30:56.889 --> 31:00.026
[dramatic music]

31:17.543 --> 31:20.046
(Michael)
But out in the bay
this morning, I was, uh..

31:24.016 --> 31:26.919
I was thinking
about asking you out.

31:29.255 --> 31:31.190
I was thinking of saying yes.

31:38.030 --> 31:40.299
(Gregory)
32-year-old mother of two.

31:40.366 --> 31:42.201
With a rare blood disorder.

31:43.135 --> 31:45.504
Still alive tonight.

31:51.577 --> 31:54.513
[dramatic music]

32:12.031 --> 32:13.199
(Jay)
'Dr. Brenner.'

32:13.966 --> 32:15.134
'Dr. Brenner!'

32:18.804 --> 32:21.340
[dramatic music]

32:33.052 --> 32:35.387
[phone ringing]

32:38.524 --> 32:40.526
Oh, God.

32:40.592 --> 32:42.328
Thank God, it's you.

32:42.394 --> 32:44.630
Please tell me, I'm not
making a horrible mistake.

32:44.696 --> 32:46.965
Of course you're not
making a mistake.

32:47.033 --> 32:48.000
But how does one know?

32:48.067 --> 32:49.368
How-how does one ever know?

32:49.435 --> 32:51.837
[sighs]
You're doing that thing you do.

32:51.903 --> 32:53.105
What thing?

32:53.172 --> 32:55.807
That existential crisis
spin-out thing

32:55.874 --> 32:57.376
that never leads you anywhere.

32:57.443 --> 32:58.977
Hey, maybe
you should have a drink.

32:59.045 --> 33:00.046
I've had three.

33:00.112 --> 33:01.347
Oops. Ooh, ooh.

33:01.413 --> 33:04.283
Hey, slow down everybody.
Slow down!

33:04.350 --> 33:07.286
Thursday's my day
to do this childcare swap thing.

33:08.620 --> 33:10.056
I hate, Thursdays.

33:10.122 --> 33:11.723
Abby..

33:11.790 --> 33:14.560
You'd tell me if you thought,
I was making a mistake, right?

33:14.626 --> 33:16.262
I would.

33:16.328 --> 33:17.696
Promise?

33:17.763 --> 33:19.831
Neela, if this doesn't make
sense, I don't know what does.

33:19.898 --> 33:23.135
Now, just, get off the phone
and get on the damn plane.

33:24.836 --> 33:26.105
Okay.

33:26.172 --> 33:27.673
I'm hanging up now.

33:27.739 --> 33:29.007
Okay.

33:33.345 --> 33:35.214
- You still there?
- Yes.

33:36.782 --> 33:37.749
I'm getting on the plane.

33:37.816 --> 33:39.185
Good idea.

33:40.852 --> 33:42.288
'Bye.'

33:45.524 --> 33:46.658
[sighs]

33:48.860 --> 33:50.028
(man on PA)
'Ladies and gentlemen,
tower's telling us'

33:50.096 --> 33:51.363
'it'll be at least an hour'

33:51.430 --> 33:54.200
'before they clear us
for take off.'

33:54.266 --> 33:56.735
'We apologize for the delay..'

33:56.802 --> 33:58.670
'We'll keep you advised.'

34:02.141 --> 34:03.475
[buzzing]

34:05.677 --> 34:07.012
Hey, Sam, um..

34:07.079 --> 34:09.181
What happened to
our staircase guy?

34:09.248 --> 34:10.516
OP came back positive
for blood

34:10.581 --> 34:12.484
right as they were
signing him into the MRA.

34:12.551 --> 34:14.085
Tony is upstairs
with them in angio.

34:14.152 --> 34:15.321
Okay. Thanks.

34:16.755 --> 34:19.125
Hey, Dr. Brenner, have
you seen Archie around?

34:19.190 --> 34:21.059
- Uh..
- I'm here.

34:22.360 --> 34:23.995
What is going on?

34:24.062 --> 34:25.531
Come with me.

34:28.434 --> 34:30.436
I stuck myself
with a needle today.

34:30.502 --> 34:33.905
And it made me realize that
I was an ass, this morning.

34:33.972 --> 34:36.375
About your work thing.

34:38.210 --> 34:39.878
An ass.

34:39.945 --> 34:42.080
I get it, Archie.

34:43.681 --> 34:44.683
What's with the pie?

34:44.750 --> 34:47.985
A symbol,
of my temporary chauvinism

34:48.053 --> 34:50.121
and a gesture of apology.

34:50.188 --> 34:51.690
My original idea was to..

34:51.757 --> 34:53.792
Bake you a pie wearing nothing
but an apron, but, uh.

34:53.859 --> 34:57.663
I had to work late,
and I don't own an apron.

34:57.729 --> 34:59.365
Me either.

34:59.431 --> 35:01.500
See?
We're perfect.

35:06.705 --> 35:08.274
So, if you can handle
being with a guy

35:08.340 --> 35:11.143
that gets stuck by needles
and kicked by patients and..

35:11.210 --> 35:14.546
...takes an occasional slug of
radiation to his cojones.

35:14.613 --> 35:15.747
[laughing]

35:17.115 --> 35:18.584
What are you talking about?

35:19.951 --> 35:22.888
Well, then I can certainly
stomach some occasional gunfire.

35:27.693 --> 35:29.161
Hmm.

35:35.867 --> 35:39.471
As long as your promise
not to get shot again.

35:39.538 --> 35:42.274
Yo hare todo lo me posible,
Archie Morris.

35:43.275 --> 35:45.444
What?

35:45.511 --> 35:47.045
See, I just wanted to see
how much Spanish

35:47.112 --> 35:48.146
you really understand.

35:48.214 --> 35:49.448
[chuckles]

35:53.719 --> 35:54.853
See that?

35:54.920 --> 35:56.522
Yeah, I think so.

35:56.588 --> 35:59.825
Ten millimeter aneurysm at
the tip of basilar junction.

35:59.891 --> 36:02.394
Headache he had this morning
was probably the initial leak.

36:02.461 --> 36:04.029
No, leak was tiny.

36:04.095 --> 36:05.931
No way it would
show up on a CT.

36:05.997 --> 36:07.299
More contrast, please.

36:08.667 --> 36:11.337
By all rights, this thing
should've been missed.

36:11.403 --> 36:13.539
- Nice work.
- Neela was right.

36:13.605 --> 36:15.241
(Matthew)
'We use electrolytically
detachable coils'

36:15.307 --> 36:17.843
'to fill the lumen.'

36:17.909 --> 36:20.246
- 'Cool.'
- Clot forms around the coils.

36:20.312 --> 36:22.281
Blocking off the aneurysm.

36:22.348 --> 36:25.050
(Matthew)
'Leaving the vessel open.'

36:25.116 --> 36:26.752
Down to neck racial..

36:26.818 --> 36:27.953
[beeping]

36:28.019 --> 36:29.221
Damn it!
Stop the Heparin.

36:29.288 --> 36:30.656
- 'Stop!'
- What's happening?

36:30.722 --> 36:33.158
Coil went beyond the confounds
of the road map.

36:33.225 --> 36:34.393
You mean you ruptured
the aneurysm?

36:34.460 --> 36:35.661
Looks that way.
Contrast!

36:35.727 --> 36:37.162
What? Doesn't he
need the OR now?

36:37.229 --> 36:38.697
Not necessarily,
If the bleeding stops.

36:38.764 --> 36:40.366
We can potentially
continue with softer coil.

36:40.432 --> 36:43.068
I'm not waiting around
to test that theory.

36:43.134 --> 36:44.270
(Tony)
Heart rate's down again.

36:44.336 --> 36:45.704
This is Dr. Brenner
from the ER.

36:45.771 --> 36:47.205
I need an OR
and a neuro-surgeon

36:47.273 --> 36:48.974
for an acute
cerebral hemorrhage.

36:49.040 --> 36:51.042
Excuse me, doctor, I believe
that's my call to make.

36:51.109 --> 36:52.578
Get the portable monitor,
get this out of the way.

36:52.644 --> 36:54.112
- Out of the way!
- Systolic's only 62.

36:54.179 --> 36:55.514
That's good. That's good.
It'll limit the bleeding.

36:55.581 --> 36:56.948
And deprive the brain of oxygen!

36:57.015 --> 36:59.050
- 'What're you doing?'
- I'm taking care of my patient.

36:59.117 --> 37:01.152
- Get the thermostat covered.
- 'This is totally out of line.'

37:01.219 --> 37:02.421
Maybe.

37:03.389 --> 37:05.223
I'm gonna write you guys up!

37:10.529 --> 37:13.599
[airplane droning]

37:28.880 --> 37:29.948
Hey.

37:31.149 --> 37:32.484
You're still here?

37:32.551 --> 37:36.622
Yeah, I crashed
in the call room for a bit.

37:36.688 --> 37:40.359
The, um, the surgeons were able
to clip the aneurysm quickly so

37:40.426 --> 37:42.694
the bleeding was contained
to a very small area.

37:44.129 --> 37:45.531
Is he gonna have brain damage?

37:46.765 --> 37:48.834
He's got a very good chance
of doing well.

37:48.900 --> 37:51.737
But we won't know the answer
to that for a while.

37:54.673 --> 37:55.807
[sighs]

37:58.209 --> 37:59.378
Where's your wife?

38:00.779 --> 38:03.515
She went home
for a shower.

38:07.386 --> 38:09.655
I don't know what
she's gonna do now.

38:10.789 --> 38:12.524
About us.

38:12.591 --> 38:14.025
You two will work
through it.

38:14.092 --> 38:16.462
Easy for you to say.

38:21.032 --> 38:22.434
The truth is a time bomb.

38:22.501 --> 38:24.670
'But once it's out,
it can't hurt you anymore.'

38:24.736 --> 38:27.506
You can move on,
You can move forward.

38:32.678 --> 38:34.012
Get some rest, Jay.

38:34.079 --> 38:35.681
I'll, um..

38:36.415 --> 38:38.450
I'll drop by later.

38:39.451 --> 38:40.952
Thanks.

38:43.389 --> 38:45.357
I appreciate that.

[indistinct radio chatter]

39:14.152 --> 39:15.854
How're you doing?

39:15.921 --> 39:18.457
Fine. You?

39:18.524 --> 39:20.392
Sure. Fine.

39:21.993 --> 39:24.329
Ah, Andrew, what do you think
of the patient's tachycardia?

39:24.396 --> 39:26.565
Uh, probably volume-related

39:26.632 --> 39:28.867
but could be due
to fever, pain, infection.

39:28.934 --> 39:30.469
Mm-hmm, good. More?

39:30.536 --> 39:34.372
Uh, drug withdrawal,
toxins, vascular.

39:34.440 --> 39:35.874
More?

39:35.941 --> 39:38.176
Uh, trauma..

39:38.243 --> 39:39.511
Iatrogenic.

39:39.578 --> 39:40.779
Neela never taught
you vindicate?

39:40.846 --> 39:42.581
- No.
- 'It's my favorite mnemonic.'

39:42.648 --> 39:46.051
For post-op rounds.
Excuse us, Dr. Brenner.

39:46.117 --> 39:47.986
If you run through this
on all your post-ops

39:48.053 --> 39:50.456
you will never miss
a major complication, okay?

39:50.522 --> 39:52.057
- Mm-hmm.
- V is for?

39:52.123 --> 39:53.091
(Andrew)
'Vascular.'

39:53.158 --> 39:54.593

What happened to you?

40:55.487 --> 40:56.522
Um..

40:56.588 --> 40:58.557
I'm sorry.

40:58.624 --> 40:59.991
I've been up all night.

41:00.058 --> 41:01.527
I see.

41:05.731 --> 41:08.033
