There's something about this guy.

He knows where we're going,
what we're thinking.

00:07.717 --> 00:11.012
It's a matter of time before
he finds out about the money in Utah...

00:11.179 --> 00:14.348
...and our way into Mexico, everything.

You can have an attorney present

00:23.274 --> 00:26.402
Carolyn, they're taking her in.
Of course. I'll keep an eye on her.

00:26.569 --> 00:28.237
I did it, Dad.

00:28.404 --> 00:29.906

00:30.072 --> 00:33.826
Otherwise, there will be consequences
that will affect us all.

...he lost it.

- Why're you here? Where's Maricruz?
- She's with me.

00:47.632 --> 00:50.676
- Just tell me where she is.
- Hey, Fernando, slow down, man.

- Might be Scofield.

Probably gonna find his brother
in there too.

Double-K Ranch by this afternoon.

01:56.701 --> 01:58.995
We could keep driving,
pick up I.J. and hit Panama.

01:59.161 --> 02:03.124
We can't hit Panama. We can't do

okay because the barcode was on it.

02:59.805 --> 03:01.682
Well, you really need the whole ticket.
