00:08.200 --> 00:11.166
This is what you missed last
week on Shameless.

00:11.166 --> 00:12.533
It was a great episode.

00:12.533 --> 00:15.233
Think you can loan me
a couple bills?
I can pay you for a job.

00:15.233 --> 00:17.100
Fiona would be pissed
if she knew you were into
this shit with me.

00:17.100 --> 00:19.700
Are you screwing
my sister's boyfriend?

00:19.700 --> 00:21.734
Hey, Mom, me and Chip are going
to swing by the hospital.

00:21.734 --> 00:23.367
Oh, this is...
Debbie Gallagher.

00:23.367 --> 00:24.633
Nice to meet you, Jimmy.

00:24.633 --> 00:25.633
Are you going to tell Fiona?

00:25.633 --> 00:27.233
I saw a really cool pink vest.

00:27.233 --> 00:29.300
I like to think of it
as a peace offering.

00:29.300 --> 00:31.700
Somebody bought
Mr. Harris' house?
Steve.

00:31.700 --> 00:32.667
Fiona's a good girl.

00:32.667 --> 00:33.734
I've known her a long time.

00:33.734 --> 00:35.000
Drive carefully.

00:35.000 --> 00:36.567
Congratulations, Ian.

00:36.567 --> 00:38.133
You are not
Frank Gallagher's son.

00:38.133 --> 00:40.000
But my father's a close
relative.

00:40.000 --> 00:41.500
Most likely one
of your brothers.

00:41.500 --> 00:43.133
If you love us,
you'll leave Liam.

00:43.133 --> 00:44.266
Take your girlfriend,

00:44.266 --> 00:45.600
get in your truck
and never come back.

00:45.600 --> 00:47.567
I've been reading more about
this Purity Ball thing.

00:47.567 --> 00:51.400
You need to be as honest
as you can,
It's okay, sweetheart.

00:51.400 --> 00:53.533
I started having oral sex...
orgy... naked body...

00:53.533 --> 00:54.734
black strap-on dildo...

00:54.734 --> 00:58.233
You whore!
He humiliated me!

Slightly?

Yeah, I think...
I think I can.

02:30.700 --> 02:32.066
I said wiggle your ears,

"The Star Spangled Banner."

Then it's even weirder.

03:06.700 --> 03:09.233
What are you doing in here?

03:09.233 --> 03:12.367
You're supposed to be
at my classroom moms'
meeting in 40 minutes.

03:12.367 --> 03:13.500
Since when?

03:13.500 --> 03:14.633
Since Mom promised to go

03:14.633 --> 03:16.133
before she
left us again.

03:16.133 --> 03:18.633
Oh, God, Debs, please don't
make me do this.

03:18.633 --> 03:20.100
I know you don't
like those meetings.

03:20.100 --> 03:21.767
That's why I never
tell you about them.

03:21.767 --> 03:23.133
Are the meetings
really that bad?

03:23.133 --> 03:24.533
It's the women from
the neighborhood.

03:24.533 --> 03:27.500
All they do is talk about
their husbands and their jobs

03:27.500 --> 03:29.467
and their dental plans.

03:29.467 --> 03:32.000
You know, maybe you should just
show them your special skill.

03:32.000 --> 03:34.266
(both laughing)
The Snob Mob always
makes fun of me

03:34.266 --> 03:37.166
for not having a parent there.

03:37.166 --> 03:38.600
So when Mom came back,
I signed her up.

03:38.600 --> 03:40.200
What's the Snob Mob?

03:40.200 --> 03:42.066
The name speaks for itself.

03:42.066 --> 03:44.033
And their moms
aren't much nicer.

03:44.033 --> 03:45.734
They're expecting a grown-up
to help with the decorations.

03:45.734 --> 03:47.500
It's only
this one time.

03:47.500 --> 03:50.500
I won't sign you up
again. I promise.

03:50.500 --> 03:52.533
Fine.

03:52.533 --> 03:53.500
Yes!

03:53.500 --> 03:55.166
Let me make
some coffee first.

03:55.166 --> 03:56.400
Okay.

03:56.400 --> 03:57.700
(sighs)

04:04.400 --> 04:05.600
What?

04:05.600 --> 04:07.266
You tell her the truth yet,

04:07.266 --> 04:08.533
Jimmy?

04:11.567 --> 04:13.667
Soon.

04:13.667 --> 04:15.467

I just can't believe it.

04:29.333 --> 04:32.033
Hey, you win some,
you lose some.

04:32.033 --> 04:33.433
What does
she see in him?

04:33.433 --> 04:35.600
Ass, gas and cash.

04:35.600 --> 04:38.400
Did you see his Porsche?
Fiona's not like that.

04:38.400 --> 04:41.767
Face it, women think
with their vaginas.

04:41.767 --> 04:43.300
Now let's vamonos.

04:43.300 --> 04:45.367

Snob Mob says it's not fair

04:54.367 --> 04:57.200
that I get to go
to all the class
parties and stuff,

04:57.200 --> 04:58.567

we don't contribute.

04:58.567 --> 05:00.200

to those bitches, Debs.

05:00.200 --> 05:01.266
No.

05:01.266 --> 05:03.233
You have to look nice.

05:03.233 --> 05:04.633
There's a hole in it.

05:04.633 --> 05:06.500
Well, that's gonna cut
out half my wardrobe.

of Frank's brothers' names?

05:31.100 --> 05:33.133
Shit, I have no idea.

Oh, I think one of them's
Wendell or something.

that wasn't Frank's kid.

05:41.233 --> 05:43.433
Plus, you know, if we find
Ian's real dad,

05:43.433 --> 05:45.367
you know, maybe
he'll give us some cash

05:45.367 --> 05:46.700
or we could report his name
to the state

05:46.700 --> 05:48.133

05:48.133 --> 05:49.533
Then I'd have to hang out
with the dude.

05:49.533 --> 05:50.567
He might be cool.

05:50.567 --> 05:52.367
Ha, Frank's brother?

05:52.367 --> 05:54.066
He's got to be better
than Frank, right?

05:54.066 --> 05:55.667
I mean, maybe he has a job
or he's sober

05:55.667 --> 05:57.300

a seat right there,

some construction paper.

06:51.133 --> 06:52.400
Okay?

Hi, Fiona.

Yeah.

Peter wants to pay the house
off sooner than later.

07:12.033 --> 07:13.300
Should have gone for a 30.

07:13.300 --> 07:15.266
That's what we have.
Rates would be higher.

07:15.266 --> 07:16.467
But your payments
would have been lower.

Peter has
a head for numbers.
We'll be okay.

09:54.166 --> 09:55.567
Well, come with us.

09:55.567 --> 09:57.300
We'll hit up
the White Castle after.

09:57.300 --> 09:59.233
It's got to be better than
hanging around here all day

09:59.233 --> 10:00.300
being angry at your dad.

10:00.300 --> 10:03.000
I'm not angry
at my dad.

10:03.000 --> 10:05.033
Well, it, uh...

10:05.033 --> 10:07.033
kind of, uh...

10:07.033 --> 10:08.600
It seems like you are.

10:08.600 --> 10:10.700
Why would I be
angry at my dad?

10:10.700 --> 10:14.400
I don't know, 'cause of, uh,
the stupid Purity Ball thing?

10:14.400 --> 10:17.266
Are you kidding me?
I'm fine.

10:17.266 --> 10:19.633
I'm just glad that my dad's
not around anymore

10:19.633 --> 10:20.767
to call me a whore!

10:20.767 --> 10:22.300
All right, whatever.

10:22.300 --> 10:23.767
What's that supposed to mean?

10:23.767 --> 10:25.400
You're going to analyze me now,

10:25.400 --> 10:27.567
like you don't have enough
problems of your own?

10:27.567 --> 10:29.266
Whoa, whoa, no, I-I just
don't understand

10:29.266 --> 10:30.467
why you give a shit

10:30.467 --> 10:31.667
about what your dad
has to say.

10:31.667 --> 10:33.333
I mean, not to be
a dick or anything,

10:33.333 --> 10:34.600
but you have been
kind of a whore.

10:34.600 --> 10:36.467
What?!

10:36.467 --> 10:38.500
No, there's no judgment.
I mean, I think it's cool.

10:38.500 --> 10:39.533
You know, you're
a free spirit...

10:39.533 --> 10:41.600
Get the fuck out of my house!
Take it easy.

10:41.600 --> 10:42.633
Out!

10:43.300 --> 10:44.734
Okay, fine.

10:44.734 --> 10:46.400
I was just trying
to help.

10:46.400 --> 10:48.600
I don't need your help!

10:48.600 --> 10:50.266
Well, have fun being angry
at your dad.

10:51.600 --> 10:53.633
Fuck off!

11:01.500 --> 11:04.333
FRANK:
How the fuck did I know
that I'd catch you

11:04.333 --> 11:05.467
icing the stairs,

11:05.467 --> 11:07.333
you sack of shit
ambulance chaser?!

11:07.333 --> 11:09.266
What are you doing here?

11:09.266 --> 11:11.367
My worker's comp
got canceled.
You're an A-hole, Frank.

11:11.367 --> 11:14.166
You should have laid low,
like I fucking told you to.

11:14.166 --> 11:15.633
Hey, watch your step.
Could be slippery.

11:15.633 --> 11:17.300
I go from home
to the Alibi Room.

11:17.300 --> 11:19.200
How much lower
can I lay?

11:19.200 --> 11:21.367
They got video, you moron.

11:21.367 --> 11:23.100
That's not possible.

11:23.100 --> 11:26.500
(Frank stammers)

11:26.500 --> 11:30.100
I was getting a case of beer for
helping my friend Tito move.

11:32.467 --> 11:35.166
It was a reimbursement dispute
with my drug dealer.

11:40.700 --> 11:42.467
Well, how was I
supposed to know

11:42.467 --> 11:44.600
her husband was going
to come back early?

11:44.600 --> 11:46.233
Call me when you get
hurt on the next job.

11:46.233 --> 11:48.100
And aim for the knees next time,
huh? Pays more than ribs.

11:48.100 --> 11:49.734
(woman screams)
Whoa, whoa,

11:49.734 --> 11:51.667
I saw that.
The city will pay.

11:51.667 --> 11:54.667
Larry M. Burke,
Attorney at Law,
at your service.
Shit.

11:58.200 --> 11:59.734
(conversing indistinctly)

11:59.734 --> 12:01.600
(whispering):
Ugh. Bitches.

12:05.166 --> 12:06.367
JASMINE:
Fiona.

12:06.367 --> 12:07.433
Wait up.
I have to go.

12:07.433 --> 12:09.100
I got stuff
to do at home.

12:09.100 --> 12:11.767
I just want to thank
you for coming today.

12:11.767 --> 12:13.066
Okay.

12:13.066 --> 12:14.633
Would love to have
you at more meetings.

12:14.633 --> 12:17.166
See if I can fit it
into my busy schedule.

12:19.300 --> 12:21.400
Don't let those
women bum you out.

12:21.400 --> 12:24.200
I didn't even
notice them.

12:24.200 --> 12:28.700
Well, between you and me,
I think they're twats.

12:28.700 --> 12:30.000
(chuckles)

12:30.000 --> 12:32.033
Why are you friends
with them, then?

12:32.033 --> 12:34.100
Because our kids
play together.

12:34.100 --> 12:35.700
They have baseball
and soccer.

12:35.700 --> 12:38.633
They're not so bad, once
you get to know them.

12:38.633 --> 12:40.433
Well, I guess they chose
not to show

12:40.433 --> 12:41.700
that side of themselves today.

12:41.700 --> 12:44.400
They're just insecure,
so they've got to make

12:44.400 --> 12:47.133
everybody else feel
as shitty as they do.

12:47.133 --> 12:48.500
Worked.

12:48.500 --> 12:51.200
How about we go
grab some coffee?

12:51.200 --> 12:53.000
I don't do coffee.

12:53.000 --> 12:54.567
Tea?

12:54.567 --> 12:56.667
No, I mean,
I do coffee.

12:56.667 --> 12:58.567
I just don't have the
luxury of doing it

12:58.567 --> 13:00.433
in the middle of the day,
like you people.

13:00.433 --> 13:03.166
(laughs)
Hey, don't be a hater.

13:04.367 --> 13:06.333
You're right. I'm sorry.

13:06.333 --> 13:08.400
You can make it up to me
by letting me buy you a drink.

13:08.400 --> 13:10.367
(laughs)
So now it's a drink?

13:10.367 --> 13:13.066
I'll take that
as a yes.

13:13.066 --> 13:15.333
Come on.

13:15.333 --> 13:18.667
(toilet flushing)

13:21.700 --> 13:23.500
What?

13:23.500 --> 13:25.700
Never seen you use
deodorant before.

13:25.700 --> 13:27.333
Well, got to find a job.

13:27.333 --> 13:29.066
You should come with me.

13:29.066 --> 13:31.133
Why?

13:31.133 --> 13:33.600
It's time you learned
the family business, son.

13:33.600 --> 13:35.767
Typed up your
résumé, Daddy.

13:35.767 --> 13:37.734
Good girl, Debs.

13:37.734 --> 13:40.467
FRANK: "Francis Gallagher
is a passionate professional

13:40.467 --> 13:41.767
"who brings
creative solutions

13:41.767 --> 13:45.233
from the idea phase
to fruition."

13:48.200 --> 13:50.400
You know me so well.

13:54.500 --> 13:56.300
You little...
Hey!

13:56.300 --> 13:57.600
LIP:
Aren't you a little bit curious

13:57.600 --> 13:59.233
to find out
who he is?
No.

13:59.233 --> 14:01.367
No, he could be any
one of these guys.

14:01.367 --> 14:03.266
Oh, yeah?
Like that one right there?

14:03.266 --> 14:04.600
Totally.

14:04.600 --> 14:07.500
Look, he's going to be a
douche bag, no matter who he is.

14:07.500 --> 14:10.000
He can't be any
worse than Frank.

14:10.000 --> 14:11.533
He's a Gallagher.

14:11.533 --> 14:13.633
Maybe he'll take you
to a game or...

14:13.633 --> 14:15.400
you know, kick in
some scratch for college,

14:15.400 --> 14:17.233
or give you a kidney.

14:17.233 --> 14:19.767
Hell, a birthday card once
a year-- that's a win, right?

14:21.100 --> 14:22.700
Do we know any
cool dads?

14:22.700 --> 14:25.233
Scotty Houston's father.

14:27.233 --> 14:29.500
But he's on that
sex offenders list

14:29.500 --> 14:32.633
for jacking off
in Sherman Park.

14:36.033 --> 14:38.700
MAN: I got a, um, pizza
delivery driver opening.

14:38.700 --> 14:42.100
Liquor salesman.
Bilingual insurance agent.

14:42.100 --> 14:44.467
Part-time nanny.
Hair salon assistant.

14:44.467 --> 14:47.600
Truck driver.
Egg donor.

14:47.600 --> 14:49.033
Egg donor?
What the f...?

14:49.033 --> 14:50.433
It's the wrong...

14:50.433 --> 14:51.500
this is the wrong category.

14:51.500 --> 14:52.667
Anything float your boat, Frank?

14:52.667 --> 14:54.400
You know what
I'm here for, Gary.

14:55.533 --> 14:58.066
Show me the special list.

14:59.133 --> 15:00.633
No, I'm not, uh...

15:00.633 --> 15:02.133
I'm not doing that
anymore, Frank.

15:02.133 --> 15:03.567
Open your top drawer.
No, no, no.

15:03.567 --> 15:05.100
The boss is cracking down.

15:05.100 --> 15:06.400
I brought the kids out.

15:06.400 --> 15:08.333
I want to show them
a thing or two.

15:08.333 --> 15:10.400
Look, you're going to
get me in trouble.

15:10.400 --> 15:12.333
I'll be discreet.

15:12.333 --> 15:13.533
Come on.

15:13.533 --> 15:15.367
We'll have the same deal
we had before.

15:15.367 --> 15:17.266
No. I need 30% this time.

15:17.266 --> 15:18.567
Ten.
Twenty-five.

15:18.567 --> 15:20.166
Twenty.

15:31.500 --> 15:33.433
Six months ago, guy
fell off a scaffold

15:33.433 --> 15:34.767
at McNally Construction.

15:34.767 --> 15:36.133
He broke three bones.

15:36.133 --> 15:37.433
I could send
you over there.

15:37.433 --> 15:40.567
Sounds good, if it weren't
for my fear of heights.

15:40.567 --> 15:42.166
What else you got?

15:42.166 --> 15:44.133
How do you feel about
metal splinters to the eye?

15:44.133 --> 15:46.033
Not so great.

15:46.033 --> 15:47.500
Okay, look. Are you up-to-date
on your rabies shots?

15:47.500 --> 15:48.633
No.

15:48.633 --> 15:50.367
Okay, what about seared flesh?

15:50.367 --> 15:53.100
Yeah. Bobby's Bagel
Joint is hiring.

15:53.100 --> 15:55.333
All right?
I got a gal--

15:55.333 --> 15:58.166
she stuck her hand
in the boiling vat.

15:58.166 --> 16:01.133
She'll be collecting
for at least 24 months.

16:01.133 --> 16:03.367
Suppose if I had to.

16:03.367 --> 16:05.000
Anything else?

16:07.367 --> 16:09.166
(sighs)

16:09.166 --> 16:10.266
Okay.

16:10.266 --> 16:12.166
Here we go.

16:12.166 --> 16:14.734
These are the jobs
nobody wants.

16:14.734 --> 16:17.467
The conditions are
hazardous, unsafe...

16:17.467 --> 16:19.266
or both.

16:19.266 --> 16:21.433
You're guaranteed
to get hurt.

16:21.433 --> 16:23.367
You're the man, Gary.

16:25.300 --> 16:29.000
(lock buzzes, door clangs open)

16:29.000 --> 16:31.066
There she is.

16:32.133 --> 16:33.300
LIP:
Hey, Grammy.

16:33.300 --> 16:35.400
Who the hell are you?

16:35.400 --> 16:36.734
Grams, it's us.

16:36.734 --> 16:38.333
Lip and Ian--
Frank's sons.

16:38.333 --> 16:40.066
Your grandsons.

16:41.333 --> 16:43.667
My goodness.

16:43.667 --> 16:46.400
Would you look at you two?

16:46.400 --> 16:50.633
I have never seen apple
and spice looking so nice.

16:50.633 --> 16:52.266
Thanks, Grammy.

16:52.266 --> 16:54.000
How's it going
in there?

16:54.000 --> 16:55.767
(sighs)
Well, the food's not so great,

16:55.767 --> 16:57.700
but the pussy's pretty good.

16:57.700 --> 16:59.233
Never thought I'd be the type.

16:59.233 --> 17:02.133
Oh, this dump ain't so bad.

17:02.133 --> 17:05.066
I can get blow anytime I like.

17:05.066 --> 17:06.767
Sounds all right.

17:06.767 --> 17:09.200
Yeah. The only thing
that sucks is,

17:09.200 --> 17:10.533
they got me cleaning toilets.

17:10.533 --> 17:12.500
I wanted to be
on the kitchen crew,

17:12.500 --> 17:14.767
but they won't let me
anywhere near the place.

17:14.767 --> 17:18.233
One meth lab explosion,
and this is what I get.

17:18.233 --> 17:20.667
Well, yeah. It's probably
the two college students

17:20.667 --> 17:22.500
that died in the
fire, Grams.

17:23.767 --> 17:25.567
So what do you want?

17:25.567 --> 17:26.700
Well, we're, uh...

17:26.700 --> 17:28.667
we're trying to find
Dad's brothers.

17:28.667 --> 17:30.400
There's, uh,
three, right?

17:30.400 --> 17:31.567
Who wants to know?

17:31.567 --> 17:33.000
Just us.

17:33.700 --> 17:35.400
One might be my dad.

17:35.400 --> 17:37.066
How so?

17:37.066 --> 17:39.533
Uh, Monica...
boned a brother.

17:39.533 --> 17:41.000
What?

17:41.000 --> 17:42.400
Monica-- she
fucked a brother.

17:42.400 --> 17:45.000
I never liked that woman.

17:46.000 --> 17:48.000
So, I give you the names,

17:48.000 --> 17:50.333
what are you
going to do for me?

17:50.333 --> 17:52.667
What do you want?

17:52.667 --> 17:55.133
Cigarettes-- carton a week.

17:55.133 --> 17:56.500
What, you can get blow in here,
but not cigarettes?

17:56.500 --> 17:58.533
Go figure.

17:58.533 --> 18:00.266
Yeah, you got it.

18:00.266 --> 18:02.500
Clayton, Jerry
and my baby Wyatt.

18:02.500 --> 18:04.300
They're in the book.

18:04.300 --> 18:06.300
But don't bother with Wyatt.

18:06.300 --> 18:08.700
He lost his testicles
in the Navy.
GUARD: All right, let's go.

18:08.700 --> 18:10.166
Okay.

18:10.166 --> 18:11.400
Thanks, Grams.

18:11.400 --> 18:12.667
Hey!
And you tell Jerry

18:12.667 --> 18:14.700
Come on!
that if he doesn't pay me back

18:14.700 --> 18:16.100
that five grand
he stole,

18:16.100 --> 18:18.233
I'm going to send
my ex-husband Ronnie over

18:18.233 --> 18:20.600
to gouge his eye out
with a grapefruit spoon.

18:20.600 --> 18:23.033
Hey, your time is up! Let's go!

18:30.433 --> 18:33.166
♪ ♪

18:33.166 --> 18:34.667
So what were you,

18:34.667 --> 18:37.533
like five or six years
behind me in school?

18:37.533 --> 18:39.100
Uh... eight, I think.

18:39.100 --> 18:40.233
Jesus.

18:40.233 --> 18:41.700
I'm an old lady.
Yeah.

18:41.700 --> 18:43.166
I was thinking the same thing.

18:43.166 --> 18:45.100
Uh, an old lady
who can do this.

18:46.000 --> 18:47.533
Damn.

18:47.533 --> 18:50.200
Yeah. I told Hal, if he
wanted another kid,

18:50.200 --> 18:52.300
he had to get me
a 24 Hour Fitness membership.

18:52.300 --> 18:55.000
It's bad enough my cookie
box is all stretched out.

18:55.000 --> 18:57.567
No.
Yeah. That's
what happens.

18:57.567 --> 19:00.734
Can't you do, like,
Kegels or something?

19:00.734 --> 19:02.133
I'm doing them right now.

19:04.300 --> 19:05.433
How many kids do you have?

19:05.433 --> 19:07.033
Three, which is plenty.

19:07.033 --> 19:08.333
I made Hal snip
his business.

19:08.333 --> 19:10.567
And then, if I kick his ass
to the curb,

19:10.567 --> 19:12.700
I can have more
with someone else if I want.

19:12.700 --> 19:15.000
Are you thinking about kicking
his ass to the curb?

19:15.000 --> 19:16.333
Some days, yes.

19:16.333 --> 19:17.633
Some days, no.

19:17.633 --> 19:19.700
(sighs)
He's a good guy.

19:19.700 --> 19:21.600
Just one thing I'd
change about him.

19:21.600 --> 19:23.033
Oh, yeah?
What's that?

19:23.033 --> 19:24.467
No passion.

19:24.467 --> 19:26.333
That's a big one.

19:26.333 --> 19:27.567
Yeah, tell me about it.

19:27.567 --> 19:29.767
Hey, ladies.

19:29.767 --> 19:31.700
The basket of E coli
you ordered.

19:31.700 --> 19:33.066
Mmm.

19:33.066 --> 19:34.166
I got this.

19:34.166 --> 19:35.767
Here you go.

19:35.767 --> 19:37.100
It's weird seeing
you in here

19:37.100 --> 19:38.133
without yelling at Frank, Fi.

19:38.133 --> 19:39.233
Well, there's always time.

19:39.233 --> 19:40.367
Keep the change.

19:40.367 --> 19:42.400
Oh!

19:42.400 --> 19:44.400
So your dad's
still a drunk?

19:45.633 --> 19:47.567
Mine, too.

19:47.567 --> 19:48.767
Yeah?

19:48.767 --> 19:50.100
Yeah.

19:50.100 --> 19:52.133
He's good
at hiding it, though.

19:52.133 --> 19:54.233
Has to.
He's on the fire department.

19:55.200 --> 19:56.500
Oh.

19:56.500 --> 19:58.100
So what about you?

19:58.100 --> 20:00.500
Are you with someone right now?

20:01.567 --> 20:03.266
I've been dating
this guy Steve.

20:04.667 --> 20:06.633
About all we
have is passion.

20:06.633 --> 20:08.767
(sighs)
Say it again, but slower.

20:08.767 --> 20:10.300
(chuckles)

20:10.300 --> 20:13.200
Before I met Hal, I was engaged
to this guy Ralph.

20:13.200 --> 20:14.467
We fucked everywhere.

20:14.467 --> 20:17.333
I mean, one time, we did it
in the bathroom at a party.

20:17.333 --> 20:18.567
(snickers)
Done that.

20:18.567 --> 20:21.233
(gasps)

20:21.233 --> 20:22.567
I like you, Miss Fiona.

20:22.567 --> 20:24.300
You're a dirty girl, like me.

20:24.300 --> 20:27.367
So what happened
with the bathroom fucker?

20:27.367 --> 20:29.767
He didn't want to be there
for the small things in life,

20:29.767 --> 20:31.333
like cooking a meal

20:31.333 --> 20:33.033
and getting sick and...

20:33.033 --> 20:35.533
laughing
at a stupid TV show.

20:35.533 --> 20:36.700
Sorry.

20:36.700 --> 20:38.567
It's okay.

20:38.567 --> 20:40.333
You know, his loss.

20:40.333 --> 20:42.400
Does your guy
like those things, or...?

20:42.400 --> 20:44.000
Mmm....

20:44.000 --> 20:45.200
I think so.

20:45.200 --> 20:46.567
Or at least he pretends to.

20:46.567 --> 20:48.000
Good. Then,
hold on to him,

20:48.000 --> 20:49.533
because guys like that
get scooped up fast,

20:49.533 --> 20:51.300
and before you know it,
you're 30

20:51.300 --> 20:53.200
and the good ones are all gone.

20:53.200 --> 20:55.533
And then you have to wait
until they get divorced,

20:55.533 --> 20:57.600
but by then, you'll be 45.

21:00.433 --> 21:02.133
Oh, God. I got to bolt.

21:02.133 --> 21:03.600
I'll see you
at the, uh,

21:03.600 --> 21:06.166
kids' party tomorrow?

21:06.166 --> 21:08.467
I wasn't really going to go
after that meeting.

21:08.467 --> 21:11.066
Oh. But now that you met me?

21:11.066 --> 21:13.567
Uh, I'll think about it.

21:13.567 --> 21:15.166
Good.

21:15.166 --> 21:16.467
Bye.

21:20.467 --> 21:21.767
Okay.

21:21.767 --> 21:23.567
Uh, bye.

21:26.333 --> 21:28.200
(sighs)

21:28.200 --> 21:29.533
You just made
my boy parts get bigger.

21:29.533 --> 21:31.567
Fuck off.

21:32.700 --> 21:34.734
Looking for
a few more guys.

21:34.734 --> 21:36.700
It's my busy season.

21:36.700 --> 21:38.467
Dangerous?
Can be,

21:38.467 --> 21:39.633
if you're not careful.

21:39.633 --> 21:41.200
Right.

21:41.200 --> 21:44.266
City contracts me to clear
the stoppages in the sewer.

21:44.266 --> 21:46.033
Not glamorous work
we're talking about.

21:46.033 --> 21:47.400
Sounds great to me.

21:48.467 --> 21:50.567
(grunts)

21:50.567 --> 21:53.400
Fill this out.

21:53.400 --> 21:55.266
How we doing, Paulie?

21:55.266 --> 21:56.667
PAULIE (echoing):
All set! Turn her on!

21:59.433 --> 22:01.533
Come to work with your dad?

22:01.533 --> 22:02.734
No school.

22:02.734 --> 22:04.233
Budget cuts.

22:04.233 --> 22:05.600
Yeah, me, too.

22:05.600 --> 22:07.734
Want to go out sometime?

22:07.734 --> 22:09.533
I'm only 12.

22:09.533 --> 22:11.433
It's cool.

22:11.433 --> 22:13.233
I'm into older women.

22:13.233 --> 22:14.667
I don't like
that you're

22:14.667 --> 22:16.567
getting hurt on purpose
to make money.

22:16.567 --> 22:18.133
Isn't that cheating?

22:18.133 --> 22:20.333
I prefer to think of it
as helping.

22:20.333 --> 22:22.500
You do?
Yeah.

22:22.500 --> 22:23.734
When I collect workman's comp,

22:23.734 --> 22:26.066
some lady has to fill out
the paperwork.

22:26.066 --> 22:28.000
That's her job.

22:28.000 --> 22:30.767
If it wasn't for me,
she'd be unemployed.
Oh...

22:30.767 --> 22:32.767
PAULIE: Shut it off,
for the love of God!

22:32.767 --> 22:35.233
Shut it off!
My eye! Aah!

22:35.233 --> 22:38.367
Fuck! The city's going to shut
me down again for weeks now.

22:38.367 --> 22:40.467
Paulie'll make
millions off this.

22:40.467 --> 22:43.000
PAULIE:
Shut it off!

22:43.000 --> 22:44.100
Call an ambulance!

22:48.767 --> 22:50.367
(sighs)

22:50.367 --> 22:51.600
Thanks.

22:51.600 --> 22:53.400
We get a call?

22:53.400 --> 22:55.200
You catch the plates
on that guy Steve's Cayenne?

22:55.200 --> 22:57.400
Uh, seven three Echo
Yankee five five.

22:57.400 --> 22:59.333
How'd I know you'd
have it memorized?

22:59.333 --> 23:00.767
You little psycho.

23:00.767 --> 23:03.433
(chuckles)
Guess what car just
got reported stolen.

23:05.667 --> 23:07.367
By Steve?

23:07.367 --> 23:08.700
No. By the owner.

23:08.700 --> 23:10.400
Roberto Cavesi.

23:11.633 --> 23:14.100
So Steve stole it.
Or bought it stolen.

23:14.100 --> 23:15.300
He's probably scratching the VIN

23:15.300 --> 23:17.100
and changing the plates
right now.

23:17.100 --> 23:19.467
Uh, did you call it in?

23:19.467 --> 23:21.033
Just getting ready.
No, uh...

23:21.033 --> 23:22.700
why don't we hold off
for a few hours?

23:24.300 --> 23:26.066
I'm not going to do
anything crazy.

23:26.066 --> 23:28.133
I just want to talk
to Fiona first.

23:28.133 --> 23:29.767
(engine starting)

23:29.767 --> 23:32.400
You may have heard how dangerous
this place has been to work.

23:32.400 --> 23:33.567
Not afraid.

23:33.567 --> 23:35.033
Medical waste disposal.

23:35.033 --> 23:36.233
Blood-soaked bandages.

23:36.233 --> 23:37.433
Contaminated needles.

23:37.433 --> 23:39.033
Body parts.
CARL:
Cool!

23:39.033 --> 23:40.533
Used to be
we could only get

23:40.533 --> 23:41.700
illegal immigrants
to work here.

23:41.700 --> 23:43.367
Looking at a true-blue
American.

23:43.367 --> 23:45.433
Yeah. Well, the CDC came
around four months ago

23:45.433 --> 23:47.767
and hit us with
some hefty fines.

23:47.767 --> 23:50.300
That's when they
brought me in.

23:50.300 --> 23:52.700
I turned this
place around.

23:52.700 --> 23:54.433
Excuse me?

23:54.433 --> 23:57.433
Oh, I'm an OSHA-certified
safety compliance officer.

23:57.433 --> 23:59.734
Take a look.

23:59.734 --> 24:03.300
Yeah, I got this place
in shipshape.

24:03.300 --> 24:05.433
All new health
and safety rules,

24:05.433 --> 24:07.400
weekly safety meetings
for all employees.

24:07.400 --> 24:10.400
"93 days accident free."

24:10.400 --> 24:12.300
Come on, I'll show
you your workstation.

24:12.300 --> 24:14.467
AIDS needles.
Okay.

24:14.467 --> 24:16.567
♪ ♪

24:19.600 --> 24:22.533
(knocking)

24:27.333 --> 24:28.533
Hey, Tony.

24:28.533 --> 24:30.000
Fiona.

24:30.000 --> 24:32.233
Wasn't sure whether to knock
over here or next door.

24:32.233 --> 24:34.200
I'm mostly here.

24:34.200 --> 24:36.333
None of my business, really.

24:36.333 --> 24:37.467
Okay.

24:37.467 --> 24:40.467
Steve around today?

24:40.467 --> 24:42.000
He's at work.

24:42.000 --> 24:43.467
Work, yeah.

24:45.166 --> 24:49.233
Fiona, Steve may not be
the guy you think he is.

24:49.233 --> 24:50.333
(chuckles)
Is this the part

24:50.333 --> 24:51.600
where it's none of
your business?

24:51.600 --> 24:55.333
There's some things about him
I don't think you know.

24:56.467 --> 24:58.200
You ever wonder why
he has all that money

24:58.200 --> 24:59.400
but he hangs out down here?

24:59.400 --> 25:00.767
(chuckles)

25:00.767 --> 25:03.233
That sounds awfully close
to being an insult.

25:03.233 --> 25:04.600
I don't, I don't
mean it like that.

25:04.600 --> 25:06.333
What other way is
there to mean it?

25:06.333 --> 25:09.233
I mean, why would a guy like
Steve be with someone like me?

25:09.233 --> 25:11.166
No.
I know
what you're doing.

25:11.166 --> 25:12.600
Bad-mouthing Steve.

25:12.600 --> 25:14.433
He'd never talk shit
about you, ever.

25:16.200 --> 25:18.100
You should go, Tony.

25:22.166 --> 25:23.633
Just be careful, Fiona.

25:29.266 --> 25:30.600
Come on.

25:30.600 --> 25:32.367
(line ringing)
Pick up.

25:32.367 --> 25:34.100
STEVE (recorded):
It's me. Leave a message.

25:34.100 --> 25:36.500
(line ringing)
Come on, pick up.

25:36.500 --> 25:38.000
STEVE (recorded):
It's me. Leave a message.

25:38.000 --> 25:38.767
Shit!

25:41.700 --> 25:46.066
MAN: Looking for someone
to work in cabinetry.

25:46.066 --> 25:49.133
From, uh, refinishing
to installation.

25:49.133 --> 25:50.166
Flexible hours,

25:50.166 --> 25:52.133
and we can offer
competitive benefits.

25:52.133 --> 25:53.500
(laughs)

25:53.500 --> 25:56.000
I got to be honest with you
about something here.

25:56.000 --> 25:57.266
Yeah, what's that?

25:57.266 --> 26:00.200
You know, most industries
are using green products.

26:00.200 --> 26:03.600
Everything's eco-friendly
this, eco-friendly that.

26:03.600 --> 26:06.166
I just haven't jumped
on the bandwagon yet.

26:06.166 --> 26:08.233
I mean, the stuff's
too damn expensive.

26:08.233 --> 26:10.400
Not to mention,
Ed Begley Jr.'s a pussy.

26:10.400 --> 26:12.633
Well, you know,
the products that we're using--

26:12.633 --> 26:14.300
they're not exactly
the safest.

26:14.300 --> 26:15.700
Formaldehyde's
our biggest culprit.

26:15.700 --> 26:16.767
As a result,

26:16.767 --> 26:18.500
lot of folks are getting
sick around here.

26:18.500 --> 26:19.567
Seems like they're
sensitive to...

26:19.567 --> 26:20.567
He'll take it.

26:20.567 --> 26:21.533
What?

26:21.533 --> 26:22.667
The job.
He'll take it.

26:22.667 --> 26:24.100
Tomorrow okay

26:24.100 --> 26:24.734
for him to start?

26:24.734 --> 26:27.033
Uh, yeah, yeah,
sure, okay.

26:27.033 --> 26:28.166
Yeah.
(laughs)

26:35.166 --> 26:37.033
Hi, I'm Karen Jackson.

26:37.033 --> 26:39.166
I mean, Daddyz Girl.

26:39.166 --> 26:41.033
This is my first
Web diary entry,

26:41.033 --> 26:44.133
and it's dedicated
to my daddy...

26:44.133 --> 26:45.567
Eddie Jackson.

26:45.567 --> 26:48.166
Here he is on the left.

26:48.166 --> 26:51.734
You can visit him at the ITC
on 126th where he works.

26:51.734 --> 26:55.567
My daddy and I recently went to
a Purity Ball, where he asked me

26:55.567 --> 26:59.400
to confess my sexual sins
so that we can be closer.

26:59.400 --> 27:02.533
But when I did,
guess what he did.

27:02.533 --> 27:04.433
He called me a whore.

27:04.433 --> 27:06.433
In front of a room
full of people.

27:06.433 --> 27:07.467
A whore.

27:07.467 --> 27:08.767
Yelled it.

27:08.767 --> 27:10.133
So guess what, Daddy.

27:10.133 --> 27:12.066
I've got something for you.

27:19.400 --> 27:21.600
These are vanilla.

27:21.600 --> 27:23.433
Where were
you two guys all day?

27:23.433 --> 27:25.000
LIP:
We went to go see Grammy,

27:25.000 --> 27:26.200
like you suggested.

27:26.200 --> 27:27.233
Yeah? How is she?

27:27.233 --> 27:28.734
Still mean
as a snake.

27:28.734 --> 27:30.066
Hmm.

27:30.066 --> 27:32.367
Carl, hey, we're
decorating not eating.

27:33.333 --> 27:34.567
Hey-yo!

27:34.567 --> 27:35.734
Thank God.

27:35.734 --> 27:36.700
What's up?

27:36.700 --> 27:38.066
Did you get my messages

27:38.066 --> 27:39.133
about Tony?

27:39.133 --> 27:40.233
Been trying you for hours.

27:40.233 --> 27:41.467
Oh, work was crazy.

27:41.467 --> 27:42.533
I'm worried.

27:44.000 --> 27:45.500
Oh, he's not gonna do
anything to me.

27:45.500 --> 27:48.133
Well, I-I think
he suspects something.

27:48.133 --> 27:49.200
No, he's just jealous.

27:49.200 --> 27:50.166
I'm careful.

27:50.166 --> 27:51.500
Promise. Okay?

27:54.133 --> 27:56.467
All right.
What do we got going on here?

27:56.467 --> 28:00.233
Well, if you're Carl, then
you're making scrotum cupcakes.

28:00.233 --> 28:02.633
(laughter)
Very nice.

28:10.300 --> 28:12.667

28:14.500 --> 28:17.567
TONY:
He already changed the plates?

28:19.400 --> 28:21.500
You're going down, fucker.

Steve give you the car?

28:35.500 --> 28:36.533
LIP:
No, I bought it.

28:36.533 --> 28:40.333
Had $74,920 lying around.

28:40.333 --> 28:41.600
IAN:
Ah, money well spent.

28:43.000 --> 28:45.100
Yo.

28:45.100 --> 28:46.300

28:46.300 --> 28:48.533
I'm, uh, sorry about yesterday,
all right?

28:48.533 --> 28:50.000
All right, call me back.

28:50.000 --> 28:50.667
Don't be mad.

28:53.033 --> 28:54.100
Karen?

28:54.100 --> 28:55.567
Yeah.

28:55.567 --> 28:58.166
So why is it we've never
met any of Frank's brothers?

28:58.166 --> 29:00.667
Family reunions
are for families.

29:08.000 --> 29:10.600
And will the guy behind
door number one be

29:10.600 --> 29:12.266
Ian Gallagher's
ticket out?

29:12.266 --> 29:13.600
Shut up.

29:15.734 --> 29:16.700
Yeah?

29:16.700 --> 29:19.000
Holy shit.
Oh, my God.

29:19.000 --> 29:20.767
What do you want?

29:20.767 --> 29:22.333
Uh, hi.

29:22.333 --> 29:23.567
Um, I'm sorry.

29:23.567 --> 29:24.667
Uh, my name is Phillip.

29:24.667 --> 29:26.066
This is my brother Ian.

29:26.066 --> 29:27.700
Yeah, so?

29:29.400 --> 29:31.166
Well, we're, uh, we're
Frank Gallagher's sons.

29:31.166 --> 29:33.300
You...!
And we were wondering
maybe if we could

29:33.300 --> 29:34.300
talk to you for a...

29:34.300 --> 29:35.166
Son of a bi...!

29:35.166 --> 29:36.500
Oh.

29:36.500 --> 29:38.633

good start.

29:38.633 --> 29:41.066

a twin, did you?

29:41.066 --> 29:43.333
No.

29:43.333 --> 29:44.467
Hey! What are you doing?

29:44.467 --> 29:46.300
Well, we should at
least talk to him.

29:46.300 --> 29:48.000
He just slammed the door
in our faces.

29:48.000 --> 29:49.100
Yeah, we probably
scared him.

29:49.100 --> 29:51.500

that dick

29:51.500 --> 29:52.767

29:52.767 --> 29:54.533

30:16.000 --> 30:18.066

Classroom Moms thing.

Yep.

I'm kicking your ass.

I'm Jasmine.
I've heard of you.

Hey.

Uh, Debs,

30:36.467 --> 30:38.033
JASMINE:
Oh, no, no, don't worry.

30:38.033 --> 30:39.300
My ironing board is still
out from last weekend.

30:39.300 --> 30:41.133
Uh, you met
my boyfriend Steve?

30:41.133 --> 30:42.233
I did. He's cute.

30:42.233 --> 30:43.633
For that, you get
a cup of coffee.

30:43.633 --> 30:44.734
Mm.

30:44.734 --> 30:46.667
Uh, sorry for coming
over unannounced.

30:46.667 --> 30:47.633
It's okay.

30:47.633 --> 30:49.233
I was just at my sister's house.

30:49.233 --> 30:50.567
She let me raid her closet.

30:50.567 --> 30:52.233
Guess what doesn't
fit her anymore.

30:52.233 --> 30:53.200
All that?

30:53.200 --> 30:54.166
She's pregnant
again.

30:54.166 --> 30:55.300
So I thought maybe that we could

30:55.300 --> 30:56.767
try this stuff on
and see what fits us.

30:56.767 --> 30:58.133
Sure.

30:58.133 --> 31:00.633
Uh, we're gonna
be upstairs.

31:00.633 --> 31:02.233
STEVE:

Thanks.

Nice to meet you, Jasmine.

31:06.633 --> 31:08.700
Yeah. Will I see you

31:19.667 --> 31:22.533
Hey, Debs.
I got your new iPad in my bag.

31:22.533 --> 31:24.000
Did you tell her, Jimmy?

31:25.200 --> 31:26.667
Family?

31:26.667 --> 31:29.667
Dropped out of med school?
Different name?

31:29.667 --> 31:32.667
Yeah, I just haven't found
the right time yet. Okay?

31:32.667 --> 31:35.133
It's unnatural for a kid
to hold a secret for so long.

31:35.133 --> 31:36.467
I'm gonna crack.

31:36.467 --> 31:38.100
Okay, okay, tonight.

31:42.133 --> 31:43.100
Yes.

a power tool?

32:19.567 --> 32:20.767
Whoa, baby steps,
my friend.

32:20.767 --> 32:24.033
Probably in
about a month.

32:26.033 --> 32:29.033
Surprised to find
an opening in this economy.

32:29.033 --> 32:30.033
Somebody get fired?

32:30.033 --> 32:32.000
Lorenzo worked
at that station.

32:32.000 --> 32:33.533
He's out on worker's comp.

32:33.533 --> 32:36.433
One man's misfortune
is another man's opportunity.

32:36.433 --> 32:37.400
What, um,

32:37.400 --> 32:39.400
what happened to him?

32:39.400 --> 32:40.567
Emphysema.

32:42.633 --> 32:46.467
And how did Lorenzo
get the big E?

32:46.467 --> 32:48.600
Inhaling
chemical fumes.

32:48.600 --> 32:50.467
That's all it took?

32:50.467 --> 32:52.433
Oh, you'd be smart
to wear a mask.

32:52.433 --> 32:54.066
What fumes, exactly?

32:54.066 --> 32:56.367
You know, so I can stay clear.

32:56.367 --> 32:58.734
Paint thinner, formaldehyde,
cleaners, stainer.

32:58.734 --> 33:00.133
You name it.

33:00.133 --> 33:02.467
I mean, he was here
one day, gone the next.

33:02.467 --> 33:04.533
That fast, huh?

33:04.533 --> 33:06.600
A man dedicates
seven years of his life

33:06.600 --> 33:08.500
to a company, and that's
the thanks he gets.

33:08.500 --> 33:11.467
A bum lung.

33:11.467 --> 33:13.567
Seven years?!

33:13.567 --> 33:16.066
You said he was here one day,
gone the next.

33:16.066 --> 33:17.400
He was.

33:17.400 --> 33:19.500
After having the job
for seven years.

33:19.500 --> 33:23.100
He was my best
work friend.

33:23.100 --> 33:25.100
Sucks not having him
around here anymore.

33:29.367 --> 33:31.433
That looks good on you.

33:47.533 --> 33:48.633
He's a good guy.

33:48.633 --> 33:49.633

His business is
booming right now.

34:00.567 --> 34:01.633
What's he do?

34:01.633 --> 34:03.300
He's an accountant.

34:03.300 --> 34:05.533
Helps people with their taxes,

34:05.533 --> 34:07.667
Are you good with numbers?

34:07.667 --> 34:10.266
I guess so.

stealing cars?

39:04.266 --> 39:05.633
Who says I steal them?

39:05.633 --> 39:07.533
(tires screech,
horn honks)
Ow! Fuck!

39:07.533 --> 39:10.500
You were in a Cayenne yesterday,
hot-wiring a 911 today.

39:10.500 --> 39:13.533
No, no, no. I lost my keys.
Motherfucker!

39:13.533 --> 39:16.367
How long?

39:16.367 --> 39:19.700
As long as I've
been fucking Fiona for.

39:19.700 --> 39:22.367
Oh, fuck!

39:24.333 --> 39:28.166
And for dinner she made pork
loin with caramelized apples

39:28.166 --> 39:29.667
with a side
of iceberg lettuce

39:29.667 --> 39:32.300
that had a little oil and
vinegar drizzled on it.

39:32.300 --> 39:33.767
Oh, what I'd do
for a little Roquefort,

39:33.767 --> 39:36.100
but with my high cholesterol
and all...

39:36.100 --> 39:37.533
I told you about that, right?

39:37.533 --> 39:39.266
About an hour ago.

39:39.266 --> 39:41.400
267. Your doctor wants it
under 150.

39:41.400 --> 39:43.767
Aw, you remember.

39:43.767 --> 39:48.567
Anyway, after dinner,
she cut some berries
for dessert.

39:48.567 --> 39:50.400
Strawberries,
raspberries,
blackberries.

39:50.400 --> 39:53.600
Oh, fuck! Ow, ow, ow!

39:53.600 --> 39:55.000
Oh, shit!

39:55.000 --> 39:56.333
Frank!

39:56.333 --> 39:57.467
(gasps)
Frank?!

39:57.467 --> 39:59.400
Here I come!

40:05.567 --> 40:07.600
(Steve groans)

40:09.633 --> 40:11.500
Second place
sucks, huh?

40:11.500 --> 40:14.033
Think this is
only about Fiona?

40:14.033 --> 40:15.066
Well, it fuckin' seems that way!

40:15.066 --> 40:16.300
Yeah? It's also about

40:16.300 --> 40:18.133
the little operation you got
going on.

40:18.133 --> 40:19.533
Yeah, I could cut you in.

40:19.533 --> 40:21.166
Oh, yeah?
(groans)

40:21.166 --> 40:23.166
You bribing an officer?

40:23.166 --> 40:25.333
Wait, wait. The way
that I figure it,

40:25.333 --> 40:27.166
there's not much
you can do.

40:27.166 --> 40:29.700
You bring me in, you risk Fiona
hating you forever.

40:29.700 --> 40:31.333
(panting)

40:31.333 --> 40:34.166
Yeah. Yeah, that's how
I see it, too.

40:34.166 --> 40:37.233
So, uh, I'm gonna leave
it up to you.

40:37.233 --> 40:39.300
What the hell
does that mean, huh?

40:39.300 --> 40:41.567
Come here.
You got two choices:

40:41.567 --> 40:43.166
You could turn yourself in,

40:43.166 --> 40:45.033
spend a couple of years
in jail.

40:45.033 --> 40:46.433
Of course, by the time
you get out,

40:46.433 --> 40:49.033
Fiona and I'll be
married.
(spits)

40:49.033 --> 40:50.266
In your dreams.

40:50.266 --> 40:52.333
(stammers)

40:52.333 --> 40:55.667
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Wait, wait.
What's the second choice?

40:55.667 --> 40:58.166
You could save
your ass.
How?

41:00.433 --> 41:02.066
Disappear tonight.

41:02.066 --> 41:04.200
Walk away.
Just leave everything behind.

41:04.200 --> 41:05.734
Don't go back
to your house.

41:05.734 --> 41:09.066
Don't call her.
Don't say good-bye. Just leave.

41:09.066 --> 41:12.500
But you have to
decide right now.

Ooh, don't mind him.

41:33.667 --> 41:37.233
He thinks he's so funny.
This is my husband Hal.

41:37.233 --> 41:39.000
How's it going?

41:39.000 --> 41:41.000
Hal... scared me there.

41:41.000 --> 41:43.300
Almost had to give you
a knee to the groin.

41:43.300 --> 41:44.300
Jazzy's told me all about you.

41:44.300 --> 41:45.767

Yeah.

41:45.767 --> 41:47.734
Said you're gonna work for me.

41:47.734 --> 41:49.633

41:49.633 --> 41:51.233
She's the boss.

41:52.600 --> 41:55.367
Don't give me that look.
Come on.

41:55.367 --> 41:56.333

Nah, nah, I really
should get upstairs.

44:20.533 --> 44:22.600
Are those pain pills?

44:22.600 --> 44:25.100
Oxy.
Give me one.

What?
