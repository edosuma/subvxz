WEBVTT

00:06.074 --> 00:08.008
I can't do it.

00:08.709 --> 00:10.278
That's all right.

00:10.944 --> 00:12.246
I don't want to.

00:13.547 --> 00:15.116
I understand.

00:25.526 --> 00:26.827
No.

00:26.960 --> 00:28.329
No!

00:40.508 --> 00:41.675
Raymond, we have to go.

00:45.079 --> 00:46.780
Raymond, we must.

00:46.914 --> 00:48.282
I'm sorry.

01:09.036 --> 01:10.338
We have company.

01:11.372 --> 01:12.406
It's Ressler.

01:15.709 --> 01:17.711
Lose him.

01:23.184 --> 01:24.418
<i>I know what you want
to do,</i>

01:24.552 --> 01:26.420
<i>but killing him
will only make it worse.</i>

01:26.554 --> 01:28.122
<i>Donald, listen to me.</i>

01:28.256 --> 01:29.723
<i>You're in no condition
to drive.</i>

01:32.426 --> 01:34.295
<i>Don't do this.</i>

02:32.253 --> 02:33.621
Raymond?

02:36.156 --> 02:37.057
Raymond?

02:40.160 --> 02:41.662
Raymond?

03:02.216 --> 03:03.851
I'm being evaluated.

03:05.118 --> 03:07.154
Not on your floricultural
skills, I hope.

03:08.922 --> 03:10.391
My mental state.

03:10.524 --> 03:12.693
Weecha's sister, Mierce,
is a shaman.

03:12.826 --> 03:16.997
She reads the flowers
for insight into my mood.

03:18.131 --> 03:20.634
I see dried-out and dark.

03:20.768 --> 03:22.836
Bad blood and betrayal.

03:22.970 --> 03:25.606
Is this still about Dembe
joining the FBI?

03:25.739 --> 03:27.475
Because that wasn't
about betrayal.

03:27.608 --> 03:29.443
It was about
upward mobility.

03:29.577 --> 03:32.045
What happened
to Elizabeth,

03:32.179 --> 03:35.716
Dembe shares a significant
responsibility for that.

03:35.849 --> 03:38.352
What are you
talking about?

03:39.787 --> 03:41.389
Townsend is responsible.

03:41.522 --> 03:44.024
He sent Vandyke,
Vandyke pulled the trigger.

03:45.526 --> 03:46.794
I thought
you were with the sister.

03:46.927 --> 03:50.163
I am.
Weecha and I are roommates.

03:50.298 --> 03:52.433
The bed is
much more comfortable
than the couch.

03:52.566 --> 03:54.802
I, being a gentleman,
I offered her the bed.

03:54.935 --> 03:57.505
She being a lady,
she invited me to join her.

03:57.638 --> 03:59.507
Marvin,
you said you had news.

03:59.640 --> 04:01.542
Let's hope
it's decidedly less dry

04:01.675 --> 04:04.678
and considerably more light.

04:07.581 --> 04:10.684
Hess, Ray, Colby.

04:10.818 --> 04:13.053
Tuesday, Wednesday,
Thursday.

04:13.186 --> 04:15.222
Three days, three hits.

04:15.356 --> 04:18.892
No who, no why,
only the what,

04:19.026 --> 04:21.429
which is a disaster.

04:21.562 --> 04:23.764
The only thing worse
is the fact

04:23.897 --> 04:26.099
that I am the first one
telling you this.

04:26.233 --> 04:27.768
Hess was hit on Tuesday.

04:27.901 --> 04:30.203
How could this possibly
be news to you?

04:30.338 --> 04:31.772
You're out of touch.

04:31.905 --> 04:34.708
You need to get your ducks
in a row, Raymond.

04:36.109 --> 04:38.111
Pinky!

04:38.245 --> 04:39.613
Oh, my goodness!

04:39.747 --> 04:42.082
Aren't you a bundle of energy
this morning?

04:42.215 --> 04:44.752
I've got orchestra practice
before school,

04:44.885 --> 04:47.087
then a math quiz
and an English presentation.

04:47.220 --> 04:49.289
Then I'm trying out
for the play.

04:49.423 --> 04:51.759
And then you're reading me
some <i>Pippi Longstocking.</i>

04:51.892 --> 04:53.226
You're weeks behind on that,
by the way.

04:53.361 --> 04:55.463
That's Sadie.

04:55.596 --> 04:57.731
Total frenemy.
Got to go.

04:58.399 --> 05:00.468
Hi, Weecha.
Bye!

05:02.269 --> 05:04.071
I'd like to think I had
that much energy once.

05:04.204 --> 05:05.906
On the other hand, if I did,
it's depressing

05:06.039 --> 05:07.240
to think about
where it all went.

05:07.375 --> 05:09.443
Perhaps this will give you
a jolt.

05:09.577 --> 05:11.545
It seems
I'm under attack.

05:11.679 --> 05:14.281
In the past week,
a strike team has taken out

05:14.415 --> 05:16.316
three key members
of my organization.

05:16.450 --> 05:17.918
I'm sorry
to hear that.

05:18.051 --> 05:20.153
Thank you, but I'm not here
for your sympathy.

05:20.287 --> 05:22.356
Good, because officially,
you don't have it.

05:22.490 --> 05:24.091
On the record, the Bureau
would be thrilled to know

05:24.224 --> 05:26.126
the Reddington organization
is under siege,

05:26.259 --> 05:28.295
but I'm guessing
you're not here
for my official response.

05:28.429 --> 05:30.330
As a rule,
I police my own business.

05:30.464 --> 05:31.932
In this case,
I need help,

05:32.065 --> 05:34.468
and if you want the blacklist
to continue,

05:34.602 --> 05:36.303
you'll give it.
It's that bad?

05:36.437 --> 05:38.772
The attacks were surgical
and strategic,

05:38.906 --> 05:41.875
requiring an insightful
knowledge of my organization.

05:42.009 --> 05:44.478
And I don't really know
from which direction

05:44.612 --> 05:45.879
this assault is coming.

05:46.013 --> 05:47.581
And there's
one more thing.

05:47.715 --> 05:49.883
Dembe...
I won't work with him again.

05:50.017 --> 05:51.985
Why not?
All that matters
is that I won't.

05:52.119 --> 05:53.286
He'll have
to be replaced.

05:53.421 --> 05:54.422
I won't do that,

05:54.555 --> 05:55.689
certainly not
without knowing why.

05:55.823 --> 05:57.525
Ask him.
He's an honest fellow.

05:57.658 --> 05:59.092
Who knows?
After he tells you,

05:59.226 --> 06:00.794
you may not want to work
with him either.

06:18.579 --> 06:19.747
Reddington's worried.

06:19.880 --> 06:21.515
His organization's
under attack,

06:21.649 --> 06:23.651
and he wants our help
to fend it off.

06:23.784 --> 06:25.519
He doesn't have a name
or a motive.

06:25.653 --> 06:28.321
Only this,
three victims in three days.

06:28.456 --> 06:29.389
Who are they?

06:29.523 --> 06:31.324
Ricki Hess.
Jack Ray.

06:31.459 --> 06:32.392
Budge Colby.

06:32.526 --> 06:33.527
Friends of yours?

06:33.661 --> 06:35.696
They were, once.
Good people.

06:35.829 --> 06:37.030
What did they do
for Reddington?

06:37.164 --> 06:39.199
Operations.
Each was responsible

06:39.332 --> 06:41.835
for a different port.
New Jersey, Norfolk, Miami.

06:41.969 --> 06:43.737
These were top people.
Well-protected.

06:43.871 --> 06:45.673
But yet someone got
to all three.

06:45.806 --> 06:47.207
No wonder
Reddington's worried.

06:47.340 --> 06:49.376
I've asked our field offices
in the relevant cities

06:49.510 --> 06:51.378
to forward us
the crime-scene information.

06:51.512 --> 06:53.981
If there's a clue in there
about who did this,
we need to find it.

06:54.114 --> 06:55.348
We already have a clue.

06:55.483 --> 06:56.850
You know who did this?
No.

06:56.984 --> 06:58.619
Just what
they're going to do next.

06:58.752 --> 07:00.854
How happy is Reddington that
you're on the task force?

07:00.988 --> 07:03.123
Not very.
In fact, he wants me
to kick you off it.

07:03.256 --> 07:04.592
What?
Why would he want that?

07:04.725 --> 07:06.126
He said
I should ask you.

07:06.259 --> 07:08.228
Vandyke.

07:08.361 --> 07:11.398
If I was doing my job
even a little bit
that day, that night,

07:11.532 --> 07:13.501
I would've seen him
long before he shot Elizabeth.

07:14.535 --> 07:15.869
I could've stopped him.

07:17.170 --> 07:18.639
And Reddington blames you
because you didn't.

07:18.772 --> 07:20.841
No more
than I blame myself.

07:20.974 --> 07:22.075
You shouldn't.
I don't.

07:22.209 --> 07:23.711
And, believe me,
I tried.

07:24.745 --> 07:26.614
Raymond has
Vandyke's phone.

07:26.747 --> 07:28.782
He had someone pull
the GPS data points

07:28.916 --> 07:30.383
from the day
Elizabeth was killed.

07:30.518 --> 07:33.787
I met Elizabeth at a diner
hours before she was shot.

07:33.921 --> 07:37.190
The GPS data points
and photos on the phone

07:37.324 --> 07:38.992
show that Vandyke
was watching us.

07:39.126 --> 07:40.628
If I was paying attention
at all,

07:40.761 --> 07:41.962
I would have noticed him.

07:42.095 --> 07:43.597
How did he know
you'd be there?

07:43.731 --> 07:45.298
I assume he was following me,
but I'm not sure.

07:45.432 --> 07:47.300
Which is why I had
the phone data sent to me.

07:47.434 --> 07:50.003
I hope that by tracking it,
I'll find out.

07:50.137 --> 07:52.706
I could use your help
plotting the data points.

07:52.840 --> 07:54.174
Of course.
So what's the clue?

07:55.242 --> 07:56.610
I thought
I was being kicked off.

07:56.744 --> 07:58.746
That's my call,
not Red's.

07:58.879 --> 07:59.947
He thought I would agree
with him

08:00.080 --> 08:01.515
once you had
explained yourself.

08:01.649 --> 08:03.483
You have, and I don't.

08:03.617 --> 08:04.918
So the clue,
let's hear it.

08:08.622 --> 08:11.725
This is a macro look
at Raymond's operations
in the Atlantic.

08:11.859 --> 08:13.627
Does he have that many
operations in the Pacific?

08:13.761 --> 08:15.929
And the Indian, Baltic,
and the Mediterranean.

08:16.063 --> 08:17.665
Nothing in the Arctic?
No.

08:17.798 --> 08:19.733
Other than a compound
on the Faroe Islands.

08:19.867 --> 08:21.334
It's official.
Our lives suck.

08:21.468 --> 08:23.136
For shipping
in the Atlantic,

08:23.270 --> 08:26.506
he uses accounts in Hamburg,
Belfast, and the Caymans.

08:26.640 --> 08:29.142
Funds are routed through
the hawala network to Morocco.

08:29.276 --> 08:31.912
He then ships
from Gibraltar, Benin
or Dakar.

08:32.045 --> 08:33.647
You really know everything,
don't you?

08:33.781 --> 08:35.849
I guess I assumed you did,
but you actually do.

08:35.983 --> 08:37.350
I didn't always.

08:37.484 --> 08:39.052
Everything with Raymond
is need-to-know,

08:39.186 --> 08:42.489
but after Elizabeth,
he couldn't function.

08:42.623 --> 08:43.724
So I had to function
for him.

08:43.857 --> 08:45.125
You took over.

08:45.258 --> 08:47.227
I did.
What was that like,

08:47.360 --> 08:48.862
going from the man
in front of the man

08:48.996 --> 08:49.963
to the man behind him?

09:08.215 --> 09:09.016
Down!

09:21.629 --> 09:22.763
A nightmare.

09:22.896 --> 09:25.165
So, Benin, Dakar,
Gibraltar.

09:25.298 --> 09:28.501
Goods ship from there
to New Jersey, Norfolk, Miami.

09:28.636 --> 09:29.803
Raymond is a middle man.

09:29.937 --> 09:31.939
He has clients.
They have goods.

09:32.072 --> 09:33.406
If the port of entry
is choked off

09:33.540 --> 09:35.208
and they can't take
delivery,

09:35.342 --> 09:37.210
that costs them money,
which Raymond has to cover.

09:37.344 --> 09:40.013
This is all very educational,
but where's the clue?

09:41.081 --> 09:42.716
Right here.

09:42.850 --> 09:44.551
The port of Baltimore.

09:50.523 --> 09:52.159
That you, Joe?

09:52.292 --> 09:55.362
I know, I know,
no smoking on site.

09:55.495 --> 09:57.030
Don't tell
her royal pain in the...

09:59.032 --> 10:01.101
What the...
Joe?

10:07.307 --> 10:10.043
Baltimore is Raymond's
only remaining port of entry

10:10.177 --> 10:11.378
on the eastern seaboard.

10:11.511 --> 10:12.780
Whoever's doing this

10:12.913 --> 10:14.614
took out
three of his port managers.

10:14.748 --> 10:17.050
<i>It's safe to assume
he'll try to take out
a fourth.</i>

10:37.938 --> 10:39.072
Do you know his name?

10:39.206 --> 10:41.008
Reginald Lawler.

10:41.141 --> 10:43.076
Let's go get him,
and hope we're not too late.

10:45.078 --> 10:46.579
Hands in the air!

11:05.966 --> 11:07.100
I won't talk.

11:16.143 --> 11:18.111
Oh, I think you will.

11:19.780 --> 11:21.214
Let's start
with the same question

11:21.348 --> 11:22.883
I asked the others,
huh?

11:23.550 --> 11:24.684
This man,

11:25.919 --> 11:27.687
where is he?

11:32.760 --> 11:34.995
What do you mean
Lawler's not answering?

11:35.128 --> 11:36.730
Then go there.

11:36.864 --> 11:38.665
I don't care
that you just gave birth.

11:38.799 --> 11:40.267
That is not my problem.

11:40.400 --> 11:43.904
My problem is $106 million
worth of goods...

11:44.037 --> 11:47.207
...we rerouted to Baltimore
that now can't land
in Baltimore

11:47.340 --> 11:49.042
unless you get Lawler
to land them.

11:49.176 --> 11:52.412
And until he lands them,
we are out 5% a day

11:52.545 --> 11:54.514
in insurance
and carrying charges.

11:54.647 --> 11:57.517
So I suggest
you wrap Junior
in a binky,

11:57.650 --> 11:58.819
shove him
onto your mammilla,

11:58.952 --> 12:00.320
and go find Lawler.

12:01.621 --> 12:02.990
Lawler's out of pocket.

12:07.060 --> 12:09.062
Yoo-hoo.
Did you hear me?

12:09.196 --> 12:12.165
Lawler is AWOL, which means
the East Coast is shut down.

12:12.299 --> 12:13.934
Mierce read the flowers.

12:14.067 --> 12:15.769
Mierce.
The shaman?

12:16.569 --> 12:18.338
She's optimistic.

12:18.471 --> 12:19.706
Is she?

12:19.840 --> 12:21.141
That's great.

12:21.274 --> 12:23.276
The shaman is optimistic.
Fantastic.

12:23.410 --> 12:25.245
I mean, it doesn't mean
there aren't problems.

12:25.378 --> 12:27.380
It just means
we'll figure them out.

12:29.049 --> 12:30.417
Do you value my counsel?

12:31.718 --> 12:33.020
I do.
Good.

12:33.720 --> 12:34.855
'Cause here it is.

12:36.389 --> 12:38.391
You've lost your mind.

12:38.525 --> 12:40.928
The world is falling apart
around you,

12:41.061 --> 12:43.763
and you're all beatific
because your ex-lover

12:43.897 --> 12:46.299
looked at a photograph
of some dead flowers

12:46.433 --> 12:47.734
and said Kumbaya.

12:47.868 --> 12:48.936
She's not my ex.

12:49.069 --> 12:50.770
We're just pausing

12:50.904 --> 12:54.107
until I resolve the issues
surrounding Elizabeth's death.

12:54.241 --> 12:55.976
That is another thing.

12:56.109 --> 12:59.012
You blame Dembe
for something he didn't do.

12:59.146 --> 13:01.148
Elizabeth's death
has been resolved.

13:01.281 --> 13:03.150
Asked. Answered.

13:03.283 --> 13:05.385
As is the reason
we are in this mess.

13:07.888 --> 13:09.789
Look, I know
this is third-rail stuff,

13:09.923 --> 13:11.825
but you're the one
getting your flowers read,

13:11.959 --> 13:13.793
so what the hell...

13:13.927 --> 13:16.796
You never should've designated
Elizabeth as your successor.

13:16.930 --> 13:19.132
She wasn't qualified.

13:19.266 --> 13:21.268
And when she passed
and you went away,

13:21.401 --> 13:23.303
there was no one to keep
all hell from breaking loose.

13:29.509 --> 13:33.013
Seven days, seven countries.

13:33.146 --> 13:34.614
I am done looking.

13:34.747 --> 13:36.583
I told you
we wouldn't find him.

13:36.716 --> 13:38.751
Oh, well, forgive me
for hoping he might not want

13:38.886 --> 13:40.820
his entire life's work
burned to the ground.

13:40.954 --> 13:43.023
His life's work
was Elizabeth.

13:43.156 --> 13:45.125
Well, my life's work
was him.

13:45.258 --> 13:47.160
And right now,
it is under siege.

13:47.294 --> 13:48.795
Chin in Taipei.

13:48.929 --> 13:51.164
Madrzyk in Dubrovnik.
Baptiste in Haiti.

13:51.298 --> 13:52.599
They're all moving
against us.

13:52.732 --> 13:55.602
And if we don't put them down,
others will follow.

13:55.735 --> 13:58.138
And when I say "we,"
I mean <i>you.</i>

13:59.106 --> 14:00.407
Me?

14:00.540 --> 14:02.609
Starting with Baptiste,
who's in Texas,

14:02.742 --> 14:04.677
meeting with
other turncoats.

14:04.811 --> 14:06.546
Red may have
picked Elizabeth,

14:06.679 --> 14:10.183
but we both know that
you are his natural successor.

14:10.317 --> 14:12.185
Now that they're gone,

14:12.319 --> 14:14.187
the organization
is yours to run.

14:14.321 --> 14:16.289
And if I don't want to?

14:17.224 --> 14:19.292
Then it gets
sliced and diced.

14:23.630 --> 14:25.933
We weren't equipped
for what came,

14:26.066 --> 14:27.400
least of all Dembe.

14:27.534 --> 14:28.735
Mm-hmm.

14:30.737 --> 14:34.474
My point, my counsel,
is this.

14:34.607 --> 14:36.209
You left us
in the lurch once,

14:37.010 --> 14:38.545
don't do it again.

14:40.347 --> 14:41.814
Call Marybeth.

14:41.949 --> 14:44.151
Tell her to stay home
with her newborn.

14:44.284 --> 14:45.718
If Lawler's
not answering,

14:45.852 --> 14:48.455
it's because
he's been captured,
if not killed.

14:48.588 --> 14:49.822
If that's the case,
we got no play.

14:49.957 --> 14:51.224
Of course we do.

14:51.358 --> 14:53.326
And I'm sure Dembe's
playing it.

14:53.460 --> 14:55.695
Dembe? I thought
you want him
off the task force.

14:55.828 --> 14:57.664
I do.
But I have no illusions

14:57.797 --> 15:00.533
that Harold will abide
by my request.

15:00.667 --> 15:03.836
And you're wrong
about Dembe's abilities.

15:03.971 --> 15:07.374
His not wanting
to run my empire
doesn't mean he couldn't.

15:07.507 --> 15:09.742
Believe me, if you and I
are realizing

15:09.876 --> 15:12.179
that Lawler's
been targeted now,

15:12.312 --> 15:14.114
Dembe's
already realized it.

15:15.182 --> 15:16.283
How can you be sure?

15:16.416 --> 15:17.717
I told you.

15:17.850 --> 15:19.386
Mierce's optimistic.

15:22.855 --> 15:24.791
We're in.

15:24.924 --> 15:26.526
Agent Park reports two guards
down at the perimeter.

15:26.659 --> 15:27.894
She's waiting on EMTs.

15:28.028 --> 15:29.429
We have no intel on the number
of mercs

15:29.562 --> 15:30.697
or where they are
in the building.

15:30.830 --> 15:32.299
A TAC unit is on the way.

15:32.432 --> 15:34.367
Do not engage until we know
what we're dealing with.

15:46.846 --> 15:48.348
I see movement.

15:48.481 --> 15:49.916
<i>I don't know who
or how many.</i>

15:50.050 --> 15:51.618
I need to get closer.

15:54.587 --> 15:57.024
I'm going to give you
one more chance.

15:58.391 --> 16:01.761
Dembe Zuma,
where is he?

16:01.894 --> 16:03.063
I don't know.

16:10.103 --> 16:11.171
Dembe, talk to me.

16:11.304 --> 16:12.939
That can't be.

16:13.073 --> 16:14.274
Where...
<i>What is it?
What can't be?</i>

16:14.407 --> 16:15.775
Not what. Who.

16:15.908 --> 16:17.177
Boukman Baptiste.

16:17.310 --> 16:18.411
We don't know
who that is.

16:18.545 --> 16:19.712
A man I killed.

16:31.891 --> 16:32.959
Daniel.

16:33.093 --> 16:34.794
Daniel!

16:34.927 --> 16:36.263
Daniel!

17:03.823 --> 17:06.459
<i>Recon said his boy
would be at home.</i>

17:15.968 --> 17:17.970
This isn't
about hurting Raymond.

17:18.105 --> 17:18.971
This is about killing me.

17:20.773 --> 17:21.974
If that's true,
I want you out of there.
Is that clear?

17:22.742 --> 17:23.710
<i>Pull back.</i>

17:26.146 --> 17:27.680
Agent Zuma,
do you copy?

17:29.182 --> 17:30.483
Agent Zuma!

17:35.955 --> 17:37.890
Ressler,
we lost contact with Dembe.

17:38.024 --> 17:39.025
<i>Yeah, we split up.</i>

17:39.159 --> 17:40.193
<i>I don't have eyes on him.</i>

17:40.327 --> 17:42.061
<i>Circle back,
then report.</i>

17:42.195 --> 17:43.596
I have your agent.

17:43.730 --> 17:45.498
<i>I assume there are others.</i>

17:46.366 --> 17:48.201
Tell them to stand down.

17:48.335 --> 17:50.069
This is Harold Cooper
with the FBI.

17:50.203 --> 17:52.071
Who am I speaking to?
Tell them.

17:52.205 --> 17:54.841
<i>I will, as soon as I hear
that my agent is all right.</i>

17:54.974 --> 17:57.510
Your agent
killed my son.

17:59.346 --> 18:01.047
I just need to know
that he's okay.

18:01.181 --> 18:05.084
He was 10,
sitting in the back
of a car,

18:05.218 --> 18:07.520
when your agent
murdered him.

18:09.356 --> 18:11.090
That's a tragedy,
but killing other people

18:11.224 --> 18:12.525
will only make it worse.

18:12.659 --> 18:14.194
Did you know that
when you hired him,

18:14.327 --> 18:16.263
that he murdered children?

18:16.396 --> 18:18.865
I'll help you,
but you have to help me.

18:18.998 --> 18:20.099
<i>We have to work together.</i>

18:20.233 --> 18:22.902
I am not a religious man.

18:23.035 --> 18:27.707
But sometimes even
a sinner's prayers
are answered.

18:40.086 --> 18:41.454
Was that Dembe?
Was he hit?

18:41.588 --> 18:42.555
Sir, I don't know.

19:10.583 --> 19:12.885
This does not
make us even!

19:13.019 --> 19:14.987
Only your daughter
does that.

19:15.121 --> 19:16.589
A child for a child!

19:17.224 --> 19:18.358
Aah!

19:40.380 --> 19:42.615
Drop it!
Don't move!

19:42.749 --> 19:44.984
Unclip it.
Face the wall.

20:00.333 --> 20:02.635
Baptiste?
Gone.

20:02.769 --> 20:05.372
Who is he, and why was he
so interested in finding you?

20:05.505 --> 20:06.839
To avenge the death
of his son.

20:06.973 --> 20:09.276
I'm sorry
you got hurt in this.

20:09.409 --> 20:10.510
Look, you gotta go
warn Isabella.

20:10.643 --> 20:11.844
He said he was after
his daughter.

20:11.978 --> 20:13.646
Right, I got this.
Call her.

20:13.780 --> 20:15.948
She needs to be called,
just not by me.

20:16.082 --> 20:18.418
Why not?
It's complicated.
I can't explain.

20:18.551 --> 20:20.487
Please, just do it.

20:20.620 --> 20:24.524
202-555-0144.

20:26.025 --> 20:28.361
I thought you and Isabella
got past the tough times.

20:28.495 --> 20:30.196
We did.

20:30.330 --> 20:31.998
Until we didn't.

20:32.131 --> 20:33.566
Aah!

20:33.700 --> 20:35.034
I don't understand.

20:35.167 --> 20:36.769
You worked
for one white guy,

20:36.903 --> 20:38.571
and now you want to work
for white guys with badges?

20:38.705 --> 20:40.473
I told you,
I haven't decided yet.

20:40.607 --> 20:42.575
That's why I'm here,
to get your opinion.

20:42.709 --> 20:44.544
My opinion
is that I don't want
my father

20:44.677 --> 20:46.313
to be a Judas
to his community.

20:46.446 --> 20:48.348
Isabella,
I know these agents.

20:48.481 --> 20:49.582
They're good people.

20:51.083 --> 20:53.119
I never criticized you
for working for Reddington.

20:53.252 --> 20:54.554
I hated it.

20:54.687 --> 20:57.524
My child almost died
because of it.

20:57.657 --> 21:00.092
But I told myself
that's what you do,

21:00.226 --> 21:01.227
it's not who you are.

21:01.361 --> 21:02.895
It's what I did.

21:03.029 --> 21:05.398
Elizabeth is dead.
Raymond is gone.

21:05.532 --> 21:07.467
I'm alone,
looking for a purpose.

21:07.600 --> 21:09.536
Is this really
who you are?

21:09.669 --> 21:11.471
A Black man
who wants to be a cop?

21:11.604 --> 21:13.740
I'm a man that wants
to helps people

21:13.873 --> 21:16.443
and a man
who's also proud
to be Black.

21:16.576 --> 21:18.077
I think I can do both.

21:18.210 --> 21:20.212
Reddington is one man.

21:20.347 --> 21:23.082
The cops are part
of a system of oppression.

21:23.215 --> 21:25.785
You do this,
people will see you
as a sellout and a traitor.

21:25.918 --> 21:27.420
I don't care
what other people see.

21:27.554 --> 21:28.788
I only care what you see.

21:28.921 --> 21:30.089
You wanna know
what I see?

21:30.222 --> 21:31.858
George Floyd,

21:31.991 --> 21:34.093
Breonna Taylor,
Philando Castile...

21:34.226 --> 21:35.762
I see them, too.
...Freddie Gray,

21:35.895 --> 21:37.897
Eric Garner,
Michael Brown...
I see them, too,

21:38.030 --> 21:39.832
and I know that any day
what happened to them

21:39.966 --> 21:41.267
could happen to me...
Atatiana Jefferson,

21:41.401 --> 21:43.436
Botham Jean,
Alton Sterling...

21:43.570 --> 21:45.438
Isabella, I see them.

21:45.572 --> 21:47.640
I know
there is injustice.

21:47.774 --> 21:49.409
But I also know
justice can be done.

21:49.542 --> 21:50.810
I've seen it done,

21:50.943 --> 21:53.112
and I think I'd find purpose
in doing it.

21:54.981 --> 21:57.316
Isabella.
Isabella!

22:12.432 --> 22:14.300
<i>This is Isabella.
Leave a message at the beep.</i>

22:14.434 --> 22:15.435
<i>Thanks.</i>

22:15.568 --> 22:17.103
It's Agent Ressler,
again.

22:17.236 --> 22:18.971
I know we keep calling,
but it's incredibly important

22:19.105 --> 22:21.273
that you call me as soon
as you get this message.

22:21.408 --> 22:22.609
Thank you.

22:22.742 --> 22:24.677
Look, we sent agents.
She's gonna be fine.

22:24.811 --> 22:27.614
He got to Hess, Ray
and Colby.

22:31.050 --> 22:33.586
Inside, quietly.

22:47.299 --> 22:48.501
Isabella!

22:52.004 --> 22:53.205
Hey, check it out.

23:04.851 --> 23:06.553
Consider yourself lucky.

23:06.686 --> 23:08.555
I'm going to let you have
the opportunity

23:08.688 --> 23:10.389
I never got with my boy.

23:10.523 --> 23:12.525
I'm going
to let you say goodbye.

23:14.360 --> 23:15.995
Papa? Papa?

23:16.128 --> 23:16.896
Papa!

23:18.330 --> 23:20.800
Don't do this.
Don't hurt her.

23:20.933 --> 23:22.535
<i>I have no interest
in hurting her.</i>

23:22.669 --> 23:24.070
Only you.

23:25.705 --> 23:27.373
Reddington.

23:27.507 --> 23:29.341
Daniel died because
you wanted his business.

23:29.476 --> 23:31.410
I can help you get
some of that.

23:31.544 --> 23:33.713
Ray, Hess, Colby,
they're middle management.

23:33.846 --> 23:35.247
Essential,
but not important.

23:35.381 --> 23:37.917
I can get you people
who are irreplaceable.

23:38.050 --> 23:40.687
Take them down
and Reddington follows.

23:41.320 --> 23:42.354
I'm listening.

23:43.422 --> 23:44.423
I need two hours.

23:44.557 --> 23:45.925
You've got one.

23:47.560 --> 23:49.061
You think he believes that

23:49.195 --> 23:50.329
you're gonna really help him
take down Reddington?

23:50.463 --> 23:51.598
He should.

23:51.731 --> 23:53.332
Because it's true.

24:01.173 --> 24:02.709
...as quickly
as you can.

24:02.842 --> 24:05.044
Yes, Marvin,
that's what I want
to talk to you about.

24:05.177 --> 24:07.514
I'll be right there.

24:07.647 --> 24:09.716
Hey.
So I plotted the rest
of the GPS data points.

24:10.717 --> 24:11.651
Later.

24:11.784 --> 24:13.419
Uh...

24:13.553 --> 24:15.421
What's going on?
Baptiste has his daughter.

24:15.555 --> 24:18.691
What?
Yeah, he's gonna sell out
Reddington to get her back.

24:18.825 --> 24:20.860
That's a joke, right?
Not to him.

24:20.993 --> 24:22.595
Uh, what can we do?
Got to issue a BOLO
on Baptiste,

24:22.729 --> 24:24.597
a silver alert
on Isabella,

24:24.731 --> 24:26.232
and let's try to keep him
from getting
Reddington killed.

24:26.365 --> 24:28.000
Dembe blamed himself
for what happened to Liz.

24:28.134 --> 24:29.301
He shouldn't.
What the hell
are you talking about?

24:29.435 --> 24:30.937
Let's get out the alerts,
then I'll show you.

24:32.572 --> 24:34.641
Did you know?

24:34.774 --> 24:37.910
Did you know,
when you gave us the case,
that it was Baptiste?

24:38.044 --> 24:40.913
That I would be going in blind
against a man
who wants me dead?

24:41.047 --> 24:43.983
I didn't. In fact,
I didn't know for sure

24:44.116 --> 24:45.484
you were even on the case,

24:45.618 --> 24:47.920
or the task force,
for that matter.

24:48.054 --> 24:49.822
I don't want you
to get hurt, Dembe.

24:49.956 --> 24:51.223
I just want you
out of my life.

24:51.357 --> 24:52.925
He has Isabella.

24:53.059 --> 24:55.394
What? Has he reached out,
made any kind of demand?

24:55.528 --> 24:57.296
He has.

24:57.429 --> 24:59.198
And we've come
to an understanding.

25:00.266 --> 25:01.834
I'm very sorry.

25:01.968 --> 25:03.202
Is there anything
I can do?

25:04.837 --> 25:07.273
You think I betrayed you.

25:07.406 --> 25:10.076
That Elizabeth died
because I let down
my guard.

25:10.209 --> 25:13.880
Fine.
I admit that.

25:14.013 --> 25:15.514
But if you want to do
something for me,

25:15.648 --> 25:17.283
admit that you let down
your guard, too.

25:17.416 --> 25:19.285
That night, and after,

25:19.418 --> 25:22.589
you abandoned your business,
and people died.

25:22.722 --> 25:24.657
That man's son.

25:24.791 --> 25:26.258
I didn't ask you
to carry on.

25:26.392 --> 25:28.795
No.
You just vanished.

25:30.196 --> 25:32.699
I killed that boy trying
to protect your empire.

25:32.832 --> 25:34.166
I was doing it for you,

25:34.300 --> 25:35.968
because you didn't do it
for yourself.

25:37.670 --> 25:39.338
Elizabeth was dead.

25:39.471 --> 25:41.173
I was gone.

25:41.307 --> 25:42.975
And you killed that boy.

25:44.510 --> 25:46.813
Do those dots
really connect?

25:46.946 --> 25:48.981
It seems
a little simplistic.

25:51.283 --> 25:53.219
Excuse me.
I have to make a phone call.

26:00.326 --> 26:01.828
I don't think
he has any idea

26:01.961 --> 26:03.763
what you were left with
after he disappeared.

26:03.896 --> 26:05.364
But I do.

26:05.497 --> 26:06.866
I know all too well.

26:09.468 --> 26:11.503
Isabella won't speak to me.

26:11.638 --> 26:14.807
She says if I do this, I'll be
a traitor to my community.

26:16.643 --> 26:18.945
She won't be the only one
that tells you that.

26:19.078 --> 26:20.913
That joining the FBI
makes you a cog

26:21.047 --> 26:23.883
in the machine
of institutional racism.

26:24.016 --> 26:25.584
You might remind her
there was a time

26:25.718 --> 26:26.986
when a Black man or woman
wasn't allowed

26:27.119 --> 26:29.521
to wear a badge
or carry a gun.

26:29.656 --> 26:32.024
But thanks to trailblazers
like Bass Reeves,

26:32.158 --> 26:34.126
Big Sam Battle
who paved the way for us,

26:34.260 --> 26:37.529
we have the privilege
of serving our community
and fellow man.

26:37.664 --> 26:39.231
In fact, scratch that.

26:39.365 --> 26:42.568
It's not a privilege,
it's a responsibility.

26:42.702 --> 26:44.403
I understand
where Isabella's coming from,

26:44.536 --> 26:48.240
but our people built
this country, died for it.

26:48.374 --> 26:51.410
We deserve justice as much
as anyone, if not more.

26:51.543 --> 26:53.746
I think this is
precisely the place

26:53.880 --> 26:56.248
where people who look like
you and me need to be.

26:56.382 --> 26:59.118
Our people need us here,
fighting for them,

26:59.251 --> 27:00.787
fighting for everyone.

27:00.920 --> 27:03.055
Here, in the system,
boots on the ground,

27:03.189 --> 27:04.590
because sometimes
we're the only ones

27:04.724 --> 27:06.492
standing between them
and the wolves at the door.

27:06.625 --> 27:08.460
In my experience,
there are wolves
on both sides.

27:10.229 --> 27:11.798
Where does Reddington
fit into all of this?

27:11.931 --> 27:14.033
He doesn't,
and I can't ask him.

27:14.166 --> 27:15.134
Because you know
what he'll say?

27:15.267 --> 27:17.103
Because I don't know
where he is.

27:17.236 --> 27:19.939
He disappeared one night
without even saying goodbye.

27:22.574 --> 27:24.343
I'm not sure
I'm staying with the Bureau.

27:24.476 --> 27:26.478
After everything
that's happened,
I may need to step away,

27:26.612 --> 27:28.614
but before I do that,

27:28.748 --> 27:30.149
if you want this,

27:30.282 --> 27:31.984
I promise you,
I'll make it happen.

27:38.157 --> 27:40.993
With Baptiste,
you said you'd come
to an understanding.

27:41.127 --> 27:43.095
That's right.
Tell me about it.

27:43.229 --> 27:45.297
Perhaps I can help you come up
with an even better one.

27:45.431 --> 27:47.599
I would before.
Not now.

27:47.734 --> 27:48.901
I mean it.

27:49.035 --> 27:51.170
I don't want
to see you hurt.

27:51.303 --> 27:54.106
You or anyone
you care about.

27:55.041 --> 27:57.509
It was an honor
protecting you.

27:57.643 --> 27:59.111
But now I have
to protect myself.

28:05.651 --> 28:06.886
Any word on Isabella?

28:07.019 --> 28:07.854
I know what I need to do.

28:07.987 --> 28:09.388
Yeah,
but does Reddington?

28:09.521 --> 28:10.890
Look, you're gonna do
what you have to do,

28:11.023 --> 28:12.524
but if what you have to do
has anything to do

28:12.658 --> 28:14.326
with what's going on between
you and Mr. Reddington...

28:14.460 --> 28:15.862
Look, he's finally
finished mapping

28:15.995 --> 28:17.363
the data points
on Vandyke's cell phone.

28:17.496 --> 28:18.831
Right, and you're gonna
wanna hear what I found.

28:18.965 --> 28:19.932
Will it help me
find Isabella?

28:20.066 --> 28:21.834
Well, uh, no.

28:21.968 --> 28:23.135
Then it will have to wait.

28:25.872 --> 28:26.806
I wish this could help.

28:27.606 --> 28:28.975
Maybe it can.

28:29.108 --> 28:30.476
How? We didn't get to tell him
what we found.

28:30.609 --> 28:32.344
No, but there's someone else
we could.

28:35.447 --> 28:36.648
Dembe, come in.

28:36.783 --> 28:38.650
I am so glad you called.

28:38.785 --> 28:40.652
This business
between you and Raymond,

28:40.787 --> 28:43.422
I want you to know I think
he is completely overreacting.

28:43.555 --> 28:45.157
I appreciate
you saying that.

28:45.291 --> 28:47.293
I mean, the suggestion
that you are in any way

28:47.426 --> 28:50.062
responsible for what happened
to Elizabeth is preposterous.

28:50.196 --> 28:51.230
I agree.
But the reason I'm...

28:51.363 --> 28:52.932
Tell me, what can I do

28:53.065 --> 28:54.666
to help set things right
between you two?

28:54.801 --> 28:56.202
I will do anything.

28:56.335 --> 28:58.070
I need the names
of his banker
in the Caymans,

28:58.204 --> 29:00.139
his arbitrage trader
in Beijing,

29:00.272 --> 29:02.141
and the arms dealer he uses
in Zagreb.

29:02.274 --> 29:03.910
I knew them before,
but he has other ones now.

29:04.043 --> 29:05.978
Yes, he does.

29:06.112 --> 29:08.380
But, uh, how would me
giving you the names

29:08.514 --> 29:10.049
help patch things up
between you two?

29:10.182 --> 29:11.517
Yeah, about that...

29:11.650 --> 29:13.452
I'm not interested
in patching anything up.

29:13.585 --> 29:17.223
All right. Uh, that's, uh...
That's unexpected.

29:17.356 --> 29:19.992
My daughter's life depends
on you giving me the names.

29:20.126 --> 29:21.360
Well, that's unfortunate,

29:21.493 --> 29:23.395
because I am, uh,
pretty confident

29:23.529 --> 29:26.132
that my life depends on me
not giving them to you.

29:26.265 --> 29:28.200
You know Raymond.
He's a stickler for things

29:28.334 --> 29:30.602
like, oh, I don't know,
say, uh,

29:30.736 --> 29:33.039
not giving the names
of his top three lieutenants

29:33.172 --> 29:34.540
to a guy
like Boukman Baptiste.

29:34.673 --> 29:36.542
I need the names,
Marvin.

29:36.675 --> 29:39.711
I see that,
and I would give them
to you if I could.

29:39.846 --> 29:41.213
I met Isabella.
She's amazing.

29:42.548 --> 29:44.884
I need the names.

29:46.152 --> 29:47.753
And this is all of them?

29:47.887 --> 29:49.721
Dembe plotted
most of the GPS data points.

29:49.856 --> 29:52.258
I finished mapping them,
then double-checked
what he'd done.

29:52.391 --> 29:56.295
This is every place Vandyke
was the day he shot Elizabeth,

29:56.428 --> 29:59.065
from 12:01 a.m.
until he, and his phone,

29:59.198 --> 30:01.267
ended up in the morgue.
Given everything
that was happening,

30:01.400 --> 30:02.634
how in God's name
did you think to have

30:02.768 --> 30:04.436
Vandyke's phone stolen
from the morgue?

30:04.570 --> 30:06.238
Muscle memory.

30:06.372 --> 30:09.275
It was completely involuntary,
like breathing.

30:09.408 --> 30:11.443
Or an innate desire
for revenge.

30:11.577 --> 30:13.279
In order to get
his daughter back,

30:13.412 --> 30:15.781
Dembe's gonna give Baptiste
damaging information
about you.

30:15.915 --> 30:17.116
What information?

30:17.249 --> 30:19.385
I don't know,
but I heard him
talking on the phone.

30:19.518 --> 30:21.153
Something about getting it
from Marvin Gerard.

30:22.721 --> 30:24.456
Dembe told us what you thought
happened that day.

30:24.590 --> 30:27.026
This...
This tells a different story.

30:27.159 --> 30:29.261
Not entirely, but, yes.

30:33.933 --> 30:35.167
He won't help you.

30:35.301 --> 30:36.903
Are you calling to gloat?

30:37.036 --> 30:38.837
<i>Put Marvin on.
Whatever you're looking for,</i>

30:38.971 --> 30:40.072
he won't give you
without my permission.

30:40.206 --> 30:41.607
Why would you give it?

30:41.740 --> 30:43.542
We can discuss that later.
There's no time now.

30:43.675 --> 30:44.710
<i>Put him on.</i>

30:49.481 --> 30:51.417
He wants tier-one names

30:51.550 --> 30:54.586
in the Caymans, Beijing
and Damascus.

30:54.720 --> 30:57.189
Give them to him. I'll get
Chuck and Morgan on him.

30:57.323 --> 31:00.026
<i>Baptiste can have the names
if it means freeing Isabella.</i>

31:00.159 --> 31:01.860
But if he acts on the intel,
I'm bleeding,

31:01.994 --> 31:03.062
so I need to get eyes
on this.

31:19.611 --> 31:21.513
Out.

31:21.647 --> 31:23.849
It's a parking facility.
Deming and Clark.

31:23.983 --> 31:26.318
<i>Sit tight.
She's on her way
with Santiago.</i>

31:26.452 --> 31:28.220
<i>Nothing happens
until Isabella is safe.</i>

31:28.354 --> 31:29.821
What about the task force?

31:29.956 --> 31:31.690
You can't go in
with them.

31:31.823 --> 31:34.326
I don't trust anyone else
to go in for me anyway,
so you're on your own.

31:38.864 --> 31:41.000
He's here,
and he's clean.

31:41.800 --> 31:43.335
Car stays, you go.

31:43.469 --> 31:44.703
Level three.

32:00.919 --> 32:01.887
Isabella.

32:02.021 --> 32:03.255
I wouldn't.

32:03.389 --> 32:05.057
Papa...

32:05.191 --> 32:06.892
Everything's
going to be okay.

32:07.026 --> 32:08.094
Did you bring
the names?

32:08.227 --> 32:09.895
Let her go, please.

32:10.029 --> 32:11.663
After I have the names.

32:22.208 --> 32:25.177
Tell me,
where do you feel it,

32:26.578 --> 32:31.083
knowing you are helpless
to save your child?

32:32.018 --> 32:33.919
I know where I felt it.

32:34.053 --> 32:36.622
I'm curious
if you feel it there, too.

32:39.825 --> 32:40.792
My back.

32:40.926 --> 32:42.428
Exactly.

32:42.561 --> 32:45.431
As if the pain
has a weight you can't bear.

32:47.599 --> 32:48.934
Look at us.

32:49.068 --> 32:51.670
So much hatred,

32:51.803 --> 32:55.807
and now so much in common.

32:55.941 --> 32:57.709
You said
you'd let her go.

32:57.843 --> 32:59.378
I need to verify
the names.

32:59.511 --> 33:00.579
That can't be done.

33:00.712 --> 33:02.314
If I couldn't do it,

33:02.448 --> 33:04.450
I wouldn't have asked you
to bring them.

33:19.565 --> 33:21.533
Man, the lot's closed.

33:23.769 --> 33:25.337
I don't speak Spanish.

33:28.307 --> 33:29.641
Chuck said
Dembe went up.

33:29.775 --> 33:30.642
We're going down.

33:45.257 --> 33:46.692
Why is this happening?

33:47.493 --> 33:48.694
Did you kill his son?

33:49.795 --> 33:52.064
Did you do it?

33:52.198 --> 33:55.401
After Elizabeth died,
I had to make decisions
for Raymond.

33:55.534 --> 33:58.304
Baptiste was taking territory.
We had to stop him.

33:58.437 --> 34:00.539
I led a team
that found him

34:00.672 --> 34:02.241
and tried
to take him out.

34:02.374 --> 34:03.642
But you took out
his son instead.

34:04.976 --> 34:06.112
Is that what happened?

34:07.613 --> 34:08.480
Yes.

34:13.652 --> 34:14.986
And after that,
you became a cop?

34:15.587 --> 34:16.488
Yes.

34:18.157 --> 34:20.826
I do solemnly swear
that I will support

34:20.959 --> 34:23.061
and defend the Constitution
of the United States

34:23.195 --> 34:25.997
against all enemies,
foreign and domestic,

34:26.132 --> 34:29.067
that I will bear true faith
and allegiance to the same.

34:32.838 --> 34:34.673
Congratulations,
Special Agent.

34:34.806 --> 34:35.907
Thank you.

34:36.041 --> 34:37.576
It wouldn't have happened
without you.

34:39.711 --> 34:41.880
Isabella didn't come.
I'm sorry.

34:49.721 --> 34:51.390
The names are correct.

34:52.324 --> 34:53.625
You have what you want.

34:53.759 --> 34:55.261
Let her go.

34:55.394 --> 34:56.695
Nothing you do here
will bring Daniel back.

35:12.478 --> 35:15.881
The French take billions
from our poor country
every year.

35:16.014 --> 35:17.916
Corrupt politicians

35:18.049 --> 35:19.718
take from the poor

35:19.851 --> 35:23.455
and open our ports
to people like Reddington.

35:23.589 --> 35:26.124
This is about
more than revenge.

35:27.058 --> 35:29.495
This is about power.

35:29.628 --> 35:32.298
This is about taking
what I am owed.

35:32.431 --> 35:34.600
What my countrymen
are owed.

35:44.075 --> 35:46.144
There are two kinds of people
in the world,

35:46.878 --> 35:49.147
wolves and sheep.

35:50.182 --> 35:51.783
The wolves take.

35:52.984 --> 35:55.854
The sheep get taken.

35:58.290 --> 35:59.825
Unfortunately for you,

36:02.261 --> 36:03.262
I am a wolf.

36:14.640 --> 36:18.009
Whoever you are,
you're a little late!

36:18.143 --> 36:20.312
Somebody's
about to get shot.

36:20.446 --> 36:21.780
I wouldn't have picked
a wolf.

36:22.714 --> 36:23.682
Who asked you?

36:23.815 --> 36:24.983
It may be
an alpha predator,

36:25.116 --> 36:27.185
but they only travel
in packs.

36:27.319 --> 36:29.788
And something tells me you're
not dealing with sheep here.

36:36.262 --> 36:38.029
It's done.

36:43.502 --> 36:44.703
A wolf

36:45.937 --> 36:48.640
would put me
out of my misery.

36:50.476 --> 36:52.444
Maybe.

36:52.578 --> 36:55.681
But I'm an FBI agent,
so you're under arrest.

36:55.814 --> 36:57.983
The names you gave them,
were they able
to confirm the identities?

36:58.116 --> 36:59.084
Yes.

37:09.861 --> 37:11.963
Trace the last call
and take care of it.

37:14.099 --> 37:15.200
Raymond has something
he wants to show you.

37:15.334 --> 37:17.303
As soon as you can.

37:17.436 --> 37:18.670
It's good to see you,
Dembe.

37:19.104 --> 37:20.539
You, too.

37:30.716 --> 37:33.519
This is the complete mapping
of Vandyke's whereabouts

37:33.652 --> 37:35.854
on the day
Elizabeth was killed.

37:35.987 --> 37:39.725
I know we've talked
about my lack of awareness

37:39.858 --> 37:41.693
and that
I should have seen Vandyke

37:41.827 --> 37:43.395
watching us
at the coffee shop.

37:43.529 --> 37:45.096
But I wanted to plot this

37:45.230 --> 37:47.265
because I've also
been agonizing
over the fact

37:47.399 --> 37:49.401
that maybe
I was the reason

37:49.535 --> 37:51.503
Vandyke was there
in the first place,

37:51.637 --> 37:53.672
that I led him
to Elizabeth.

37:53.805 --> 37:55.707
Well, as it turns out,
you didn't.

37:56.842 --> 37:58.377
He was nowhere near you
that day,

37:58.510 --> 37:59.878
not before the coffee shop.

38:01.246 --> 38:03.615
Which means
he didn't follow you there.

38:03.749 --> 38:05.617
And we know
where Elizabeth was?

38:05.751 --> 38:09.755
Yes, I've plotted her day
more times
than I care to remember.

38:09.888 --> 38:12.290
So if Vandyke
didn't follow either of you

38:12.424 --> 38:14.460
to the coffee shop,
how did he know where to go?

38:14.593 --> 38:16.528
Someone obviously told him.

38:16.662 --> 38:19.365
Yeah,
but who could have known?

38:19.498 --> 38:21.967
I mean, I'm as big
a conspiracy theorist
as the next guy,

38:22.100 --> 38:24.370
but this sounds like some
classic <i>Third Man</i> stuff.

38:25.571 --> 38:26.972
Yeah, that night,

38:27.739 --> 38:29.741
I couldn't sleep.

38:29.875 --> 38:33.078
I felt like if I stayed,
I would implode,

38:33.211 --> 38:35.947
that I'd collapse into myself
like a black hole

38:36.081 --> 38:38.149
and cease to exist.

38:39.217 --> 38:40.586
So I left.

38:40.719 --> 38:43.755
I walked away and...
And kept walking.

38:45.290 --> 38:48.560
Until I found
Weecha and Mierce.

38:48.694 --> 38:49.661
And they helped me.

38:51.096 --> 38:52.831
And I helped them.

38:57.803 --> 38:59.771
I'm sorry
that I abandoned you.

39:02.140 --> 39:04.776
Whatever happened,
I shouldn't have done that.

39:07.913 --> 39:09.481
And I'm sorry
that I did.

39:12.183 --> 39:14.486
I know you're upset that
I gave Elizabeth the letter.

39:14.620 --> 39:16.087
Ah. It's done.

39:18.256 --> 39:20.158
And perhaps
it did bring her some peace.

39:21.427 --> 39:23.995
But we can't be fighting
each other

39:24.129 --> 39:26.798
when we have a real enemy
to fight, to find.

39:27.899 --> 39:29.134
You'll have
to forgive Marvin.

39:29.267 --> 39:30.836
He's a professional skeptic.

39:30.969 --> 39:34.973
But someone led Elizabeth's
killer to her that night.

39:35.106 --> 39:40.045
And we need to work together
to find who that was.

39:40.178 --> 39:43.148
But that's a quest
that will have to wait
another day.

39:43.281 --> 39:45.751
I'm late to a very
important engagement.

39:45.884 --> 39:47.986
More important
than finding out
who killed Elizabeth?

39:49.320 --> 39:50.622
I think so.

39:55.861 --> 39:59.197
"Pippi was sure
that her mother
was now up in Heaven,

39:59.330 --> 40:02.000
"watching her little girl
through a peephole
in the sky,

40:02.133 --> 40:03.902
"and Pippi often waved up
at her

40:04.035 --> 40:06.404
"and called,
'Don't you worry about me.

40:06.538 --> 40:08.339
"'I'll always come out
on top.'"

40:10.476 --> 40:12.110
That was so awful.

40:12.243 --> 40:13.278
It was my fault.

40:13.411 --> 40:15.413
It's all my fault.

40:15.547 --> 40:17.816
I want to protect you,

40:17.949 --> 40:20.018
but all I do is seem
to put you in harm's way.

40:20.151 --> 40:21.553
Can you promise me
it's over?

40:21.687 --> 40:23.388
With Baptiste, yes.

40:23.522 --> 40:24.823
With everything.

40:24.956 --> 40:26.191
With what you've done
with Reddington.

40:26.324 --> 40:28.760
Is it done coming back
to us? To me?

40:29.961 --> 40:30.862
I don't know.

40:33.064 --> 40:35.467
I'm going away.
With Elle.

40:35.601 --> 40:36.968
Not forever,
but for now.

40:37.102 --> 40:38.604
Where will you go?

40:38.737 --> 40:39.938
I don't think
I should tell you that.

40:41.006 --> 40:42.040
This isn't a punishment.

40:42.173 --> 40:43.441
It's not about you
being a cop.

40:43.575 --> 40:44.610
I know.

40:44.743 --> 40:46.478
No, really, it's not.

40:46.612 --> 40:48.079
I was upset with you
about that.

40:48.213 --> 40:51.182
And I'd be lying if I said
I still wasn't upset.

40:52.183 --> 40:53.885
But you can be
a police officer

40:54.019 --> 40:55.787
and a man
who's proud to be Black.

40:57.422 --> 40:59.558
I know that because I know
that's who you are.

41:02.327 --> 41:04.496
I want you to feel safe.

41:04.630 --> 41:07.599
And I want us
to be together.
I've missed you.

41:07.733 --> 41:09.267
Yeah,
I've missed you, too.

41:12.771 --> 41:14.239
Can I see Elle
before you go?

41:14.372 --> 41:15.641
Of course.

41:15.774 --> 41:16.908
I was reading her a story.

41:17.042 --> 41:18.910
I'm sure she'd love for you
to finish it.

41:21.880 --> 41:26.251
"'You have plenty of courage,
I am sure,' answered Oz.

41:26.384 --> 41:31.056
"'All you need
is confidence in yourself.

41:31.189 --> 41:34.593
"'There is no living thing
that is not afraid

41:34.726 --> 41:36.528
"'when it faces danger.'"

41:36.662 --> 41:38.496
"Her father,
Pippi had not forgotten,

41:38.630 --> 41:41.633
"he was a sea captain
who sailed
on the great ocean,

41:41.767 --> 41:44.169
"and Pippi had sailed with him
in his ship

41:44.302 --> 41:46.471
"until one day,
her father blew overboard

41:46.605 --> 41:48.273
"in a storm
and disappeared."

41:48.406 --> 41:52.911
"'True courage is in facing
danger when you are afraid,

41:53.044 --> 41:57.315
"'and that kind of courage
you have in plenty.'

41:57.448 --> 41:58.984
"'Perhaps I have,

41:59.117 --> 42:01.787
"'but I'm scared
just the same,'
said the Lion."

42:01.920 --> 42:04.956
"But Pippi
was absolutely certain that
he would come back.

42:05.090 --> 42:07.158
"She would never believe
that he had drowned.

42:07.292 --> 42:08.960
"She was sure he had floated

42:09.094 --> 42:12.130
"until he landed on an island
inhabited by cannibals.

42:12.263 --> 42:14.900
"And she thought
he had become
the king of all the cannibals

42:15.033 --> 42:16.167
"and went around
with a golden crown

42:16.301 --> 42:17.869
"on his head
all day long.

42:18.003 --> 42:19.571
"'My papa is a cannibal king,

42:19.705 --> 42:21.206
"'it certainly isn't
every child
who has such a stylish...'"
