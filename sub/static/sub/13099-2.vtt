00:03.333 --> 00:04.417
(male #1)
'This is Team 3,
we're in position'

00:04.500 --> 00:05.667
'and ready for transport.'

00:05.750 --> 00:07.333
(male #2)
'Team 3, ready that.'

00:09.375 --> 00:12.417
[dramatic music]

00:15.833 --> 00:17.125
(Mollari)
'This is madness!'

00:17.208 --> 00:20.417
How much longer will
this council be held hostage

00:20.500 --> 00:21.833
to its missing members?

00:21.917 --> 00:24.250
Their behavior is inexcusable.

00:24.333 --> 00:27.375
Ambassador Delenn
remains indisposed.

00:27.458 --> 00:30.167
Indisposed! She's in a cocoon!

00:30.250 --> 00:32.167
Yes?

00:32.250 --> 00:33.250
And you.

00:33.333 --> 00:34.833
'Do you have any idea'

00:34.917 --> 00:36.250
'when Ambassador G'Kar'

00:36.333 --> 00:38.292
will decide to grace us
with his presence?

00:38.375 --> 00:41.833
For that matter, do you have
any idea where he is?

00:41.917 --> 00:43.458
Uh! There, you see?

00:43.542 --> 00:47.375
One deserts his post without any
explanation, the other one picks

00:47.458 --> 00:51.500
the most breathtakingly
inconvenient moment possible

00:51.583 --> 00:53.667
to explore new career options.

00:53.750 --> 00:56.333
Like, becoming a butterfly!

00:56.417 --> 00:59.000
I move that we reprimand
both governments

00:59.083 --> 01:00.542
and demand that they assign

01:00.625 --> 01:02.750
new representatives
to this council.

01:04.208 --> 01:05.792
Is there a second?

01:09.417 --> 01:10.833
Well, seeing that the motion
isn't carried

01:10.917 --> 01:12.875
and the rest of the agenda
has been tabled

01:12.958 --> 01:15.333
'I recommend that we adjourn
for the rest of the day'

01:15.417 --> 01:19.750
and reconvene tomorrow at 9:00
and try this again.

01:19.833 --> 01:20.958
[gavel strikes]

01:24.417 --> 01:27.375
Na'Toth, you never answered
my question.

01:27.458 --> 01:29.625
Where is Ambassador G'Kar?

01:29.708 --> 01:32.000
I've told you all I know.

01:32.083 --> 01:34.333
He left to investigate
the attack on our base

01:34.417 --> 01:36.125
in Quadrant 37.

01:36.208 --> 01:38.208
And you've had no word
from him since then.

01:38.292 --> 01:40.667
Ambassador G'Kar
is more than able

01:40.750 --> 01:42.042
to take care of himself.

01:42.125 --> 01:43.750
[dramatic music]

01:45.250 --> 01:48.333
Stay together. Just
a little further to the gate.

01:53.083 --> 01:54.667
(man #3)
'We're not going to make it!'

01:54.750 --> 01:56.417
Yes, we will!

01:56.500 --> 01:58.167
(man #3)
'No.'

01:58.250 --> 02:00.750
'Leave us. Tell the others!'

02:02.750 --> 02:04.125
'Warn them!'

02:08.417 --> 02:11.208
'In death, we salute you.'

02:11.292 --> 02:14.083
'Honor our names. Goodbye.'

02:19.292 --> 02:21.083
G'Quan bless your names.

02:21.167 --> 02:23.083
You will be remembered
with honor.

02:25.833 --> 02:28.000
[explosion]

02:28.083 --> 02:30.042
Set jumpgate sequence.

02:30.125 --> 02:32.042
Destination, Babylon 5.

02:38.792 --> 02:42.875
(male narrator)
The Babylon project was our
last best hope for peace.

02:44.125 --> 02:47.667
A self-contained world
five miles long

02:47.750 --> 02:49.542
located in neutral territory.

02:50.958 --> 02:52.958
A place of commerce
and diplomacy

02:53.042 --> 02:55.917
for a quarter of a million
humans and aliens.

02:58.750 --> 03:00.917
A shining beacon in space

03:01.000 --> 03:04.000
all alone in the night.

03:04.083 --> 03:07.750
It was the dawn
of the third age of mankind.

03:07.833 --> 03:10.333
The year the great war
came upon us all.

03:12.458 --> 03:13.750
This is the story

03:13.833 --> 03:16.167
of the last
of the Babylon stations.

03:16.250 --> 03:18.500
The year is 2259.

03:18.583 --> 03:21.625
The name of the place
is Babylon 5.

03:21.708 --> 03:24.750
[theme music]

03:54.250 --> 03:56.917
[music continues]

04:07.708 --> 04:10.417
[instrumental music]

04:21.208 --> 04:24.250
[indistinct chattering]

04:31.625 --> 04:33.667
Doctor, how's it going?

04:33.750 --> 04:35.167
I thought
you'd be off duty by now.

04:35.250 --> 04:36.667
Uh, I'm running a little late.

04:36.750 --> 04:38.500
Uh, can I talk to you
for a minute?

04:38.583 --> 04:41.500
Yeah. I can afford a minute.

04:41.583 --> 04:43.167
My sister's coming for a visit

04:43.250 --> 04:45.833
and I have time
before she arrives.

04:47.333 --> 04:49.000
How is Mr. Garibaldi?

04:49.083 --> 04:50.333
Frankly, not great.

04:50.417 --> 04:52.417
That's what I wanna
talk to you about.

04:53.625 --> 04:55.125
I've pulled out
every trick I know

04:55.208 --> 04:56.375
and nothing seems to work.

04:56.458 --> 04:58.667
He's not coming out
of that coma.

04:58.750 --> 05:00.833
Now, there is one other option

05:00.917 --> 05:03.625
but it means performing
an unauthorized procedure.

05:05.250 --> 05:06.833
I see.

05:06.917 --> 05:08.917
Have you tried contacting
his next of kin?

05:09.000 --> 05:10.417
Tried and failed.

05:10.500 --> 05:13.875
And I'm afraid if we wait any
longer, it won't do any good.

05:14.708 --> 05:15.958
What's the procedure?

05:17.458 --> 05:19.625
Alright, last year I came into
possession of an alien device

05:19.708 --> 05:22.375
capable of draining
the life energy from one person

05:22.458 --> 05:23.583
and giving it to somebody else.

05:23.667 --> 05:26.458
It was used
as a kind of death penalty.

05:26.542 --> 05:27.875
Well, it sounds nasty.

05:27.958 --> 05:31.042
Yes, but it could be used safely
at lower settings

05:31.125 --> 05:33.000
to heal people.

05:33.083 --> 05:34.917
Are you speaking
from personal experience or--

05:35.000 --> 05:36.583
No, no, no,
I-I haven't done it myself.

05:36.667 --> 05:38.250
But I have seen it used
that way.

05:38.333 --> 05:39.583
Still, there is a risk

05:39.667 --> 05:41.917
and I wanted your permission
before trying it.

05:44.292 --> 05:45.750
There's no other way?

05:46.625 --> 05:48.000
It's his only hope.

05:51.000 --> 05:52.875
We don't have much choice,
do we?

05:56.792 --> 05:59.375
Who are you going to hook up
to the machine?

05:59.458 --> 06:00.792
Well, I can't ask anyone else
to take the risk

06:00.875 --> 06:03.125
if something goes wrong.

06:03.208 --> 06:04.417
I'll do it.

06:11.000 --> 06:13.792
[dramatic music]

06:25.458 --> 06:27.500
[whirring]

06:28.833 --> 06:30.833
(man on PA)
'Welcome to Babylon 5.'

06:30.917 --> 06:34.708
'We are at your disposal with
a range of onboard facilities..'

06:36.417 --> 06:38.333
Johnny!

06:38.417 --> 06:40.542
Lizzy. Lizzy, Lizzy.

06:40.625 --> 06:41.875
[laughs]

06:41.958 --> 06:44.292
- Hi, big brother.
- Oh, it's good to see you.

06:44.375 --> 06:45.833
- How was your flight?
- Fine.

06:45.917 --> 06:47.542
A little bumpy
coming out of hyperspace.

06:47.625 --> 06:49.667
- But otherwise no complaints.
- Good.

06:49.750 --> 06:50.792
You look like
you've gained a little weight

06:50.875 --> 06:52.375
since the last time I saw you.

06:52.458 --> 06:54.375
Ah, well, what can I say, huh?

06:54.458 --> 06:57.583
After three years in deep patrol
eating synthetics

06:57.667 --> 06:59.417
I took one look
at the garden here

06:59.500 --> 07:01.167
and completely lost control.

07:01.250 --> 07:03.000
Sounds great. I'm starved.

07:03.083 --> 07:05.417
Well, good. Let's get
you somethin' to eat.

07:05.500 --> 07:07.625
I'll have your bags
sent to your quarters, alright?

07:12.583 --> 07:14.958
(Morden)
'I understand you were looking
for me, ambassador.'

07:18.208 --> 07:20.000
How can I be of service?

07:21.833 --> 07:25.417
The destruction of
the Narn base in Quadrant 37

07:25.500 --> 07:28.583
is drawing
quite a lot of attention.

07:28.667 --> 07:31.083
Yes. That was the intent.

07:31.167 --> 07:32.917
And you are absolutely certain

07:33.000 --> 07:34.750
that it cannot be
traced back to me?

07:34.833 --> 07:36.667
Oh, beyond a shadow of a doubt.

07:36.750 --> 07:38.000
The Narns will never
be able to prove

07:38.083 --> 07:40.708
that it was done
at your instigation.

07:40.792 --> 07:43.750
And based on your promise
to take care of it

07:43.833 --> 07:45.917
your government
accepts your responsibility

07:46.000 --> 07:47.875
without question or hesitation.

07:48.625 --> 07:50.917
Perfect symmetry.

07:51.000 --> 07:54.042
I believe that this
little demonstration

07:54.125 --> 07:56.417
will bring you some
very interesting propositions.

07:56.500 --> 07:57.625
Yes.

07:57.708 --> 07:59.292
But what happens if I'm asked

07:59.375 --> 08:03.417
for another of these
little demonstrations?

08:03.500 --> 08:05.000
Then we'll provide it.

08:05.083 --> 08:07.042
Simply choose your target.

08:07.125 --> 08:09.792
A colony, an outpost.

08:09.875 --> 08:12.375
[laughs]

08:12.458 --> 08:14.875
Why don't you eliminate
the entire Narn homeworld

08:14.958 --> 08:16.875
while you're at it?

08:16.958 --> 08:19.292
One thing at a time, ambassador.

08:19.375 --> 08:20.833
'One thing at a time.'

08:23.375 --> 08:25.917
Oh, one last thing.

08:26.000 --> 08:29.542
A small favor in return for our
good efforts on your behalf.

08:29.625 --> 08:33.333
A person in an important
position like yours

08:33.417 --> 08:34.792
hears many things.

08:34.875 --> 08:36.417
And if you should hear
about anything strange

08:36.500 --> 08:38.417
happening out on the rim..

08:38.500 --> 08:40.583
...I'd appreciate
being informed.

08:40.667 --> 08:42.875
Even if it seems unimportant.

08:42.958 --> 08:44.750
Good day, ambassador.

08:54.125 --> 08:55.417
And it's certainly a big change

08:55.500 --> 08:57.125
from running the Agamemnon.

08:57.208 --> 08:58.875
It's more like being
a military governor

08:58.958 --> 09:01.333
of a small,
self-contained country

09:01.417 --> 09:04.792
you know, with its own rules,
a thousand different languages..

09:04.875 --> 09:08.500
Everyone coming and going
at all hours, uh..

09:08.583 --> 09:11.708
Still, there's
a terrific energy here.

09:11.792 --> 09:14.000
A sense of really
being on the frontier.

09:17.125 --> 09:19.125
- How's your salad?
- Oh, it's fine.

09:19.208 --> 09:21.750
- Huh.
- Fine.

09:21.833 --> 09:23.542
You don't look fine.

09:24.333 --> 09:26.750
It's just..

09:26.833 --> 09:28.792
We haven't seen each other
in two years.

09:28.875 --> 09:30.500
And from the moment I got here

09:30.583 --> 09:32.542
you haven't stopped talking
about work.

09:33.625 --> 09:35.583
This is me, Johnny, remember?

09:37.542 --> 09:39.750
I'm sorry. I, I just, uh..

09:39.833 --> 09:41.417
Seeing you again..

09:42.667 --> 09:44.292
...it brings it all back.

09:44.375 --> 09:45.958
I know.

09:46.750 --> 09:48.333
That's why I'm here.

09:49.583 --> 09:51.375
Nothing has ever really been
the same between us.

09:51.458 --> 09:54.000
Not since Anna passed away.

09:54.083 --> 09:56.125
[sighs]
I need more time, that's all.

09:56.208 --> 09:57.333
Johnny.

09:57.417 --> 10:00.500
It's been two years.

10:00.583 --> 10:02.375
Then why do I still have
to remind myself

10:02.458 --> 10:05.042
that she's gone?

10:05.125 --> 10:07.208
Why, when I see something
interesting on the news

10:07.292 --> 10:10.625
I'll say to myself,
"Oh, I gotta remember

10:10.708 --> 10:14.000
to mention this to Anna
later on?"

10:14.083 --> 10:16.667
Sometimes I will turn
to say something to her.

10:16.750 --> 10:18.875
She's not there,
but just for a second

10:18.958 --> 10:20.917
I don't know
why she's not there.

10:24.208 --> 10:25.917
And then, I remember.

10:29.250 --> 10:31.583
I miss her, Liz.

10:31.667 --> 10:34.333
I miss her and love her
as much right now

10:34.417 --> 10:37.250
as I did when
she was still here.

10:37.333 --> 10:40.417
I know. It's not easy.

10:40.500 --> 10:42.000
She was my friend
for a lot longer

10:42.083 --> 10:45.000
than you were married to her,
and I miss her, too.

10:45.083 --> 10:48.125
But if she were here right now,
she'd be mad as hell at you.

10:48.208 --> 10:50.208
She would want you
to get on with your life

10:50.292 --> 10:52.542
and stop burying yourself
in your work.

10:52.625 --> 10:54.625
It's not about work.

10:54.708 --> 10:55.917
What's it about?

11:02.292 --> 11:04.375
I, I just don't wanna get
into this thing right now, okay?

11:04.458 --> 11:07.417
Can't we just
table this for a while, huh?

11:08.250 --> 11:10.583
I mean, can't we just..

11:10.667 --> 11:12.292
...talk for a while?

11:12.375 --> 11:16.958
Get to know each other again and
just ...catch up a little?

11:18.667 --> 11:19.792
Okay.

11:21.250 --> 11:23.000
The discussion is tabled..

11:24.375 --> 11:25.750
...until later.

11:26.708 --> 11:27.875
[sighs]

11:30.917 --> 11:33.958
[dramatic music]

11:36.125 --> 11:38.083
Hmm.

11:38.167 --> 11:39.667
Soon now.

11:40.500 --> 11:41.750
Soon.

11:46.458 --> 11:47.833
(Sheridan)
'Doctor?'

11:47.917 --> 11:49.458
Captain?

11:49.542 --> 11:50.833
You're up late.

11:52.250 --> 11:53.625
I couldn't sleep.

11:53.708 --> 11:57.000
I started thinking
about life and death.

11:57.083 --> 11:58.458
What we can do, what we can't do

11:58.542 --> 12:00.750
and...maybe what we should do

12:00.833 --> 12:02.000
'when we have the chance.'

12:04.042 --> 12:06.750
- This is the device, huh?
- Correct. I was just about to--

12:06.833 --> 12:09.417
- Plug me in.
- No. I-I thought we agreed--

12:09.500 --> 12:11.792
Look, I can't have you
giving your life energy

12:11.875 --> 12:14.875
and operating this machine
at the same time.

12:14.958 --> 12:17.750
What happens if you pass out
during the process, huh?

12:17.833 --> 12:19.500
'It'll just keep taking
your life energy'

12:19.583 --> 12:21.292
'until you're dead, correct?'

12:21.375 --> 12:23.500
- I don't know.
- Exactly.

12:23.583 --> 12:25.583
It's better you're running it
and someone else is at this end.

12:25.667 --> 12:26.958
He's my patient.

12:27.042 --> 12:28.083
But when I took over B-5

12:28.167 --> 12:30.000
he became my responsibility.

12:31.583 --> 12:33.500
I don't think
losing my head of security

12:33.583 --> 12:36.542
two weeks into the job
will look good on my resume.

12:36.625 --> 12:38.042
Alright, we split
the difference.

12:38.125 --> 12:40.500
We'll both do it in shifts,
but I'll go first.

12:40.583 --> 12:43.000
Make sure the configuration
is correct. Deal?

12:45.750 --> 12:46.792
Done and done.

12:50.917 --> 12:52.000
[beeping]

12:59.208 --> 13:00.750
(G'Kar)
'Close the door.'

13:04.208 --> 13:05.375
Close.

13:14.625 --> 13:17.375
Weep for the future, Na'Toth.

13:17.458 --> 13:19.042
Weep for us all.

13:24.458 --> 13:25.792
Are you alright?

13:25.875 --> 13:29.500
I have looked
into the darkness, Na'Toth.

13:30.875 --> 13:34.083
You cannot do that and ever be
quite the same again.

13:35.750 --> 13:37.583
When you told me
about the destruction

13:37.667 --> 13:39.375
of our base at Quadrant 37

13:39.458 --> 13:41.208
I knew that only a major power

13:41.292 --> 13:44.125
could attempt an assault
of that magnitude.

13:44.208 --> 13:46.125
'But none of the governments
here could have done it'

13:46.208 --> 13:48.292
which left
only two possibilities.

13:48.375 --> 13:51.417
A new race or an old race.

13:52.458 --> 13:54.500
'A very old race.'

13:56.375 --> 13:59.375
G'Quan spoke of
a great war long ago

13:59.458 --> 14:01.375
against an enemy so terrible

14:01.458 --> 14:04.417
it nearly overwhelmed
the stars themselves.

14:04.500 --> 14:07.583
G'Quan said that before
the enemy was thrown down

14:07.667 --> 14:09.083
it dwelled in the system

14:09.167 --> 14:12.083
at the rim of known space.

14:12.167 --> 14:14.333
I searched for days

14:14.417 --> 14:17.167
going from one system
to another.

14:19.667 --> 14:21.917
Then..

14:22.000 --> 14:24.292
...on dark, deserted worlds

14:24.375 --> 14:26.750
where there should be no life

14:26.833 --> 14:30.458
where no living thing has walked
in over a thousand years

14:30.542 --> 14:33.667
something is moving..

14:35.333 --> 14:38.208
...gathering its forces quietly.

14:39.208 --> 14:42.417
Quietly, hoping to go unnoticed.

14:43.625 --> 14:46.792
We must warn the others,
Na'Toth.

14:46.875 --> 14:50.208
After a thousand years,
the darkness has come again.

14:52.292 --> 14:55.333
[instrumental music]

15:02.667 --> 15:05.583
[dramatic music]

15:22.292 --> 15:23.417
Hi.

15:28.083 --> 15:29.417
What's up, doc?

15:30.917 --> 15:33.333
- Franklin to Ivanova.
- 'Ivanova. Go.'

15:33.417 --> 15:35.250
I think you and the captain
need to get down to Medlab.

15:35.333 --> 15:37.708
- Garibaldi's awake.
- 'On our way.'

15:42.458 --> 15:44.625
(male #3 on radio)
'Sector 10, robbery down here.'

15:45.750 --> 15:49.458
- Garibaldi?
- 'Uh, yeah.'

15:49.542 --> 15:52.708
- How do you feel?
- It's not important.

15:53.583 --> 15:54.917
Did you stop them?

15:55.000 --> 15:56.500
They're gonna kill
the president.

15:56.583 --> 15:58.667
I'm afraid the president's dead.

15:58.750 --> 16:01.042
Earth Dome is saying
it was an accident.

16:01.125 --> 16:03.292
Oh, no.

16:03.375 --> 16:06.000
No, no.
I got to see the commander.

16:06.083 --> 16:08.292
He's not here, alright?
He's been reassigned.

16:09.750 --> 16:11.792
What?

16:11.875 --> 16:13.250
Oh, God!

16:13.333 --> 16:15.833
I'm out of here for a few days,
the whole place goes to hell.

16:15.917 --> 16:17.958
Well, I hope
I can prove otherwise.

16:19.667 --> 16:21.958
Captain John Sheridan,
your new CO.

16:23.250 --> 16:25.083
I don't know you.

16:25.167 --> 16:26.833
No..

16:26.917 --> 16:29.542
...but I think
we'll get along just fine.

16:29.625 --> 16:30.750
Garibaldi?

16:31.500 --> 16:33.167
I know you're tired.

16:33.250 --> 16:35.292
But do you remember
what happened?

16:35.375 --> 16:37.042
'Do you remember who shot you?'

16:40.000 --> 16:42.125
Yeah, I-I keep trying.

16:45.667 --> 16:47.167
[zapping]

16:49.958 --> 16:51.625
No, I-I, I don't remember.

16:51.708 --> 16:53.708
I was shot from behind, I..

16:55.333 --> 16:56.667
I never saw who.

17:05.333 --> 17:06.500
Center, this is security..

17:06.583 --> 17:08.750
Ah, Ambassador G'Kar.

17:08.833 --> 17:11.125
Back from
your little expedition, I see.

17:11.208 --> 17:13.250
Did you find
anything interesting?

17:13.333 --> 17:14.458
Yes, I'm going to call

17:14.542 --> 17:16.500
for a meeting of the council
to discuss it.

17:16.583 --> 17:17.958
Oh?

17:18.042 --> 17:21.583
Mollari...the grievances
between my people and yours

17:21.667 --> 17:24.542
will never be resolved
except with Centauri blood.

17:24.625 --> 17:26.625
Accept that as a given.

17:26.708 --> 17:29.208
Well, it's good to know
we're appreciated.

17:29.292 --> 17:32.542
But there may be some dangers
that threaten both our peoples.

17:32.625 --> 17:35.125
Not to mention the Minbari,
the Earthers, the League

17:35.208 --> 17:37.417
and everyone else around here.

17:37.500 --> 17:39.167
Except, possibly, the Vorlons.

17:39.250 --> 17:41.417
I don't know what could
threaten them, really.

17:42.833 --> 17:45.625
Very soon, ambassador,
I may require your help

17:45.708 --> 17:47.542
in the interests
of all our governments.

17:47.625 --> 17:50.125
Help? My help?

17:50.208 --> 17:51.833
Well, this is astonishing.

17:51.917 --> 17:53.208
Have you spoken to the others?

17:53.292 --> 17:55.458
No. I was just on my way
to speak with Delenn.

17:55.542 --> 17:58.792
Ah, well, you may find that
rather difficult at the moment.

17:58.875 --> 18:00.125
You see, just after you left

18:00.208 --> 18:02.333
we discovered
something happened to her.

18:02.417 --> 18:04.792
What? Is she still alive?

18:04.875 --> 18:07.167
That is a very good question.

18:30.042 --> 18:32.917
[Delenn groaning]

18:33.500 --> 18:35.125
'Lennier.'

18:36.083 --> 18:39.125
[Delenn groaning]

18:40.750 --> 18:41.875
Delenn?

18:44.542 --> 18:46.542
Help me.

18:53.958 --> 18:55.583
[groans]

18:55.667 --> 18:56.750
[gasps]

18:59.292 --> 19:00.375
[beeping]

19:00.458 --> 19:01.542
Yes.

19:01.625 --> 19:03.333
Dr. Franklin,
could you please come

19:03.417 --> 19:05.708
to Ambassador Delenn's
quarters at once?

19:05.792 --> 19:06.875
Well, I'm kind of
in the middle of things.

19:06.958 --> 19:08.375
Mr. Garibaldi is awake.

19:08.458 --> 19:10.333
Please. This is urgent.

19:10.417 --> 19:13.083
I think something may be wrong
with Ambassador Delenn.

19:16.000 --> 19:19.208
Dr. Franklin, before we can
allow you to proceed

19:19.292 --> 19:21.250
I must insist
that anything you learn here

19:21.333 --> 19:24.833
in the next few minutes
be kept strictly confidential.

19:24.917 --> 19:26.708
Of course, you have my word.

19:26.792 --> 19:28.167
But if she's sick

19:28.250 --> 19:30.125
I'm surprised you didn't call in
one of your doctors.

19:30.208 --> 19:33.917
(Delenn)
I'm not ill..

19:34.000 --> 19:35.375
...doctor.

19:39.750 --> 19:41.875
[panting]

19:41.958 --> 19:44.583
What I have become..

19:46.417 --> 19:49.167
...what I suffer..

19:51.208 --> 19:53.375
...requires you..

19:54.708 --> 19:56.625
'...alone.'

19:56.708 --> 19:58.333
[Delenn groaning]

20:07.083 --> 20:10.458
Well, granted, I still get
stir-crazy sometimes.

20:10.542 --> 20:12.625
But the wonderful thing is..

20:12.708 --> 20:14.625
...if I wanna see aliens

20:14.708 --> 20:16.750
I don't have to go
lookin' for 'em.

20:16.833 --> 20:19.333
They come here.

20:19.417 --> 20:21.083
All I've to do
is go out that door

20:21.167 --> 20:23.667
go down two levels..

20:23.750 --> 20:24.792
...and there's always
somethin' new.

20:24.875 --> 20:28.542
Some new race I'd never heard of

20:28.625 --> 20:30.250
and, and never seen.

20:33.208 --> 20:35.125
The only thing
that could make it better..

20:36.625 --> 20:37.792
[smirks]

20:37.875 --> 20:40.750
...is if Anna were here
to share it.

20:40.833 --> 20:43.833
And with that
scientist mind of hers..

20:43.917 --> 20:45.625
...she would've loved it.

20:51.250 --> 20:52.708
What is it, Johnny?

20:54.708 --> 20:58.042
[sighs]
Damn it, Liz,
it's my fault she's not here.

20:58.125 --> 21:00.583
Oh, Johnny, stop that.

21:00.667 --> 21:03.917
You've been carrying this guilt
around for two years.

21:04.000 --> 21:06.292
She died on a deep space
exploration vessel

21:06.375 --> 21:07.500
that exploded.

21:07.583 --> 21:09.500
'You had nothing
to do with that.'

21:09.583 --> 21:11.917
No, but I'm responsible
for her being on that ship

21:12.000 --> 21:13.292
in the first place.

21:17.417 --> 21:19.500
We were gonna get together
on our anniversary.

21:22.417 --> 21:24.542
She'd arranged to meet me

21:24.625 --> 21:26.708
when we pulled into space dock

21:26.792 --> 21:30.417
'off of Centauri Prime.'

21:30.500 --> 21:34.208
Well, we hadn't seen much
of each other the year before.

21:34.292 --> 21:36.208
You know
what the military life is like.

21:38.458 --> 21:41.542
Well...I'd gotten real busy.

21:41.625 --> 21:45.083
I was up to my ears
in inspections, drills and..

21:45.958 --> 21:47.750
I had to call her and..

21:48.958 --> 21:50.792
...tell her I couldn't make it.

21:52.583 --> 21:53.708
[scoffs]

21:55.625 --> 21:56.917
I was too busy.

21:57.875 --> 21:59.667
Too damn busy.

22:04.667 --> 22:05.833
Well, right after I canceled

22:05.917 --> 22:07.583
she took that
science officer's job

22:07.667 --> 22:09.125
on the Icarus.

22:10.958 --> 22:13.083
"Just a two week survey."

22:13.167 --> 22:15.875
Said she'd be back before
I even noticed she was gone.

22:17.958 --> 22:19.750
[instrumental music]

22:21.250 --> 22:23.083
Well, she didn't come back.

22:24.917 --> 22:27.625
And I've been noticing
she's gone every minute..

22:27.708 --> 22:29.125
...of every day.

22:30.625 --> 22:31.833
You can't blame yourself,
Johnny--

22:31.917 --> 22:33.375
Yes, I can.

22:36.417 --> 22:38.917
If I hadn't canceled out,
if I hadn't driven her away

22:39.000 --> 22:40.458
she'd be here right now.

22:42.333 --> 22:44.792
'But the thing is,
the real killer is..'

22:49.917 --> 22:52.417
When we used to talk to each
other over long distance..

22:54.167 --> 22:57.125
...we would say "I love you"
at the end.

23:00.542 --> 23:03.292
The last time
I talked to her, I..

23:03.375 --> 23:04.542
...I don't know, I was rushed.

23:04.625 --> 23:07.125
I, I didn't say it and..

23:07.208 --> 23:09.875
...I didn't even realize it.

23:09.958 --> 23:13.417
And I figured, I'd,
I'd make it up to her later on.

23:17.208 --> 23:19.292
[music continues]

23:21.208 --> 23:23.875
I never even got to say
goodbye to her.

23:31.292 --> 23:32.917
Oh, Lizzie, I miss her.

23:36.542 --> 23:38.708
I just didn't want her to go
without telling her

23:38.792 --> 23:40.500
I loved her..

23:40.583 --> 23:41.958
...one last time.

23:43.583 --> 23:45.333
[music continues]

23:46.542 --> 23:48.333
[Delenn groaning]

23:57.000 --> 23:59.542
Is it supposed to do that?

23:59.625 --> 24:01.708
(Delenn)
'I do not know.'

24:01.792 --> 24:02.958
[Delenn whimpering]

24:17.833 --> 24:20.125
[intense music]

24:22.125 --> 24:26.625
What...am I?

24:28.333 --> 24:31.833
What...am I?

24:32.792 --> 24:34.417
[groaning]

24:39.792 --> 24:42.458
Which leads me to believe
that the ancient race

24:42.542 --> 24:45.042
described in our holy books
may have returned.

24:45.125 --> 24:49.000
If true, this holds
grave danger for all of us.

24:49.083 --> 24:51.125
You say the dead worlds
previously controlled

24:51.208 --> 24:55.250
by this force
are inhabited again?

24:55.333 --> 24:57.083
Maybe they've been colonized
by someone else.

24:57.167 --> 24:59.125
No. It's them.
I'm sure of it.

24:59.208 --> 25:02.208
The-the configuration
of the ships that fired on us

25:02.292 --> 25:05.083
was too similar
to the drawings made by G'Quan.

25:05.167 --> 25:06.458
Then why have we heard
nothing official

25:06.542 --> 25:09.208
from the Narn Homeworld
confirming your opinion?

25:09.292 --> 25:11.583
The Kha'Ri have certain
reservations.

25:11.667 --> 25:13.250
Then we're back
where we started.

25:14.750 --> 25:15.833
'We need proof.'

25:15.917 --> 25:18.250
And I'm prepared
to give you that proof.

25:18.333 --> 25:20.625
Despite the misgivings of
a few in the inner circle

25:20.708 --> 25:23.417
of my government, I have
convinced them to send a ship

25:23.500 --> 25:26.750
to the heart of the enemy's
old domain, located at the rim

25:26.833 --> 25:28.167
of known space.

25:28.250 --> 25:31.250
'A dark and terrible place
known as Z'ha'dum.'

25:31.333 --> 25:34.000
It has been dead
for a thousand years.

25:34.083 --> 25:36.333
No one goes there.
No one.

25:36.417 --> 25:38.500
'Our ship will arrive
in 12 hours'

25:38.583 --> 25:40.208
coming out of hyperspace
as close

25:40.292 --> 25:42.417
to the enemy's homeworld
is possible.

25:42.500 --> 25:44.458
'They will scan the planet
for signs of life'

25:44.542 --> 25:47.708
and return to hyperspace
before anyone can attack.

25:47.792 --> 25:50.458
And if someone is living there?

25:50.542 --> 25:54.625
Then all our races stand
on the edge of extinction.

25:55.625 --> 25:57.417
[intense music]

25:59.708 --> 26:01.083
(Morden)
'You wanted to see me,
ambassador?'

26:02.667 --> 26:05.167
You said I should tell you
if I heard about anything

26:05.250 --> 26:08.458
unusual happening out
on the rim.

26:08.542 --> 26:10.292
The Narns have sent
a military ship

26:10.375 --> 26:13.208
to investigate the world
called Z'ha'dum.

26:14.958 --> 26:16.958
Ah, I see you know it.

26:18.458 --> 26:20.500
Only in passing.

26:20.583 --> 26:24.125
Do you know by any chance know
when it's scheduled to arrive?

26:24.208 --> 26:26.833
Yes, in a little under
ten hours.

26:34.917 --> 26:39.083
Chief. Chief.
I brought her like you asked.

26:39.167 --> 26:40.750
Hey, Lou, good work.

26:41.875 --> 26:43.708
He tell you?

26:43.792 --> 26:45.000
Yes.

26:45.083 --> 26:46.667
Mr. Garibaldi,
you have to understand

26:46.750 --> 26:50.250
that even if I go into your
mind, even if I do find anything

26:50.333 --> 26:52.292
it's not admissible in court.

26:52.375 --> 26:53.792
Oh, look, I know.

26:55.292 --> 26:57.792
Look, I gotta find out
who did this to me.

26:57.875 --> 27:01.333
If there's anything
in my memory, anything I missed

27:01.417 --> 27:03.333
or forgot, I mean,
you can find it.

27:03.417 --> 27:06.542
You may be placing too much
faith in my abilities.

27:06.625 --> 27:08.792
But I'll try.

27:08.875 --> 27:11.167
Given your condition, this
will have to be a deep scan.

27:13.458 --> 27:15.458
It may cause you
some discomfort.

27:18.958 --> 27:20.000
Let's do it.

27:21.625 --> 27:23.667
[intense music]

27:31.667 --> 27:33.750
I told you not to poke around

27:33.833 --> 27:36.042
in things that are
too big for you.

27:36.125 --> 27:38.208
Yeah, well, it's a little
late for that.

27:38.292 --> 27:40.042
Now, up against the wall.

27:40.125 --> 27:41.583
(Devereaux)
I think not.

27:49.083 --> 27:51.333
No! Oh, God, no.

27:51.417 --> 27:53.083
What? What did you see?

27:59.500 --> 28:02.042
Hey, you gotta come see this.

28:02.125 --> 28:03.667
What is it?
I'm kind of busy here.

28:03.750 --> 28:06.292
Uh, Ambassador Delenn's
out of that weird cocoon

28:06.375 --> 28:08.500
and-and-and she's got wings
just like a butterfly.

28:08.583 --> 28:10.292
You-you gotta come see.

28:10.375 --> 28:13.000
(male #4 on radio)
'Teams two, three and eight,
please report..'

28:14.542 --> 28:16.375
[instrumental music]

28:19.417 --> 28:20.583
[grunts]

28:22.667 --> 28:23.708
Go ahead. Go for it!

28:23.792 --> 28:26.042
Make my fraggin' solar year!

28:27.083 --> 28:29.125
[intense music]

28:34.792 --> 28:36.458
That was for the chief.

28:36.542 --> 28:38.292
Alright, that's enough.

28:38.375 --> 28:40.292
He's all yours, sir.

28:40.375 --> 28:42.583
Unless you wanna walk around
the block a few times

28:42.667 --> 28:43.875
and leave him to us.

28:43.958 --> 28:46.167
I appreciate your enthusiasm,
Officer Welch

28:46.250 --> 28:48.583
but I don't think
that'll be necessary.

28:48.667 --> 28:50.708
'Put him in lockup
under maximum security.'

28:50.792 --> 28:52.708
I want checks
every quarter hour.

28:52.792 --> 28:53.875
(Lou)
'Yes, sir.'

28:53.958 --> 28:55.292
Take him!

28:59.083 --> 29:00.250
[music continues]

29:04.417 --> 29:05.458
[grunts]

29:06.667 --> 29:08.458
Hey, hey, hey,
what are you doing?

29:08.542 --> 29:09.542
I have to get out of here.

29:09.625 --> 29:10.958
Look, you are in no condition.

29:11.042 --> 29:12.583
They caught the guy
who shot you, alright--

29:12.667 --> 29:14.500
Yeah, I know, I know, I know,
but I have to see him.

29:14.583 --> 29:16.292
I have to talk to him myself.

29:16.375 --> 29:17.500
Look, you can see him later.

29:17.583 --> 29:19.333
No, I can see him now!

29:19.917 --> 29:21.083
Come here.

29:22.250 --> 29:24.417
Look, why are you doing this
to yourself, huh?

29:24.500 --> 29:26.417
Because I have to.

29:26.500 --> 29:29.500
Now, you can help me
or you can get out of my way.

29:39.250 --> 29:40.750
I trusted you.

29:43.042 --> 29:44.542
I taught you everything I knew.

29:45.750 --> 29:47.667
I gave you every break.

29:50.083 --> 29:52.500
I even treated you
like my own brother.

29:54.208 --> 29:55.500
'Why?'

29:57.583 --> 29:58.792
My God, why'd you do it?

30:01.083 --> 30:02.292
I had my instructions.

30:02.375 --> 30:03.500
'From who?'

30:06.125 --> 30:09.000
There's a new order
coming back home, Garibaldi.

30:09.083 --> 30:12.417
You can either be part of it or
you can be stepped on.

30:12.500 --> 30:14.333
'A winner or a loser.'

30:14.417 --> 30:16.292
I'm with the side
that's gonna win.

30:18.125 --> 30:20.708
- Homeguard?
- 'Homeguard.'

30:20.792 --> 30:22.417
They're a bunch of misfits.

30:24.083 --> 30:27.167
You really don't have a clue,
do you, Garibaldi?

30:27.250 --> 30:29.042
Look, if I were you,
I'd start talking straight

30:29.125 --> 30:31.958
because right now, you're
in a whole world of trouble.

30:32.042 --> 30:34.375
You don't even know
what trouble is..

30:34.458 --> 30:37.250
...but you're gonna
find out real soon.

30:37.333 --> 30:41.417
Yeah, well, while
I'm worrying about that..

30:41.500 --> 30:43.875
...roll this one around
in your head.

30:43.958 --> 30:47.250
Shooting a senior officer
is an act of treason and mutiny.

30:47.333 --> 30:48.875
The penalty is spacing.

30:48.958 --> 30:52.542
'They put in an airlock, seal it
and open the space door.'

30:52.625 --> 30:54.542
You spend the next
five minutes chewing vacuum

30:54.625 --> 30:57.083
until your lungs turn
inside out, your eyeballs freeze

30:57.167 --> 30:58.667
and your heart explodes.

30:58.750 --> 31:00.292
'It's the worst kind of death
you can imagine.'

31:00.375 --> 31:02.375
'And when that day comes..'

31:02.458 --> 31:04.375
...I'll be there
to push the button.

31:05.333 --> 31:07.375
[intense music]

31:17.583 --> 31:19.500
Hey, Garibaldi.

31:23.917 --> 31:25.250
Be seeing ya.

31:33.667 --> 31:35.792
- 'Yes.'
- Captain.

31:35.875 --> 31:37.417
(John)
'I know, I know,
the council meeting.'

31:37.500 --> 31:40.250
I'm just trying to finish up
a few things here before I--

31:40.333 --> 31:42.292
It's the President.
He's on Gold Channel One.

31:42.375 --> 31:43.625
Wants to speak to you.

31:43.708 --> 31:45.083
Unless you'd like me
to have him call back later--

31:45.167 --> 31:46.167
Ivanova.

31:46.250 --> 31:48.125
Yes, sir. Stand by.

31:52.125 --> 31:54.833
Mr. President, to what do
I owe the honor of this call.

31:54.917 --> 31:56.625
Captain Sheridan,
I've just read the report

31:56.708 --> 31:58.042
on your recent arrest.

31:58.125 --> 32:00.417
Do you really think
this individual was involved

32:00.500 --> 32:04.083
in a conspiracy
to assassinate my predecessor?

32:04.167 --> 32:06.000
It's a little early
for that, sir.

32:06.083 --> 32:08.042
All we have on him now
is attempted murder

32:08.125 --> 32:10.000
of the senior officer
who uncovered

32:10.083 --> 32:11.250
the alleged conspiracy.

32:11.333 --> 32:13.875
I see. This is
very serious, captain.

32:13.958 --> 32:16.667
If there's the slightest
chance this might be true

32:16.750 --> 32:18.458
we need to investigate fully.

32:18.542 --> 32:20.208
- Oh, I agree, sir.
- Good.

32:20.292 --> 32:23.750
I want him put on the first
prison shuttle to Earth.

32:26.250 --> 32:28.250
I-I'm not sure
I understand, sir.

32:28.333 --> 32:31.500
We can't risk this
being mishandled, captain.

32:31.583 --> 32:33.583
During the time I served
as vice president

32:33.667 --> 32:37.375
under Santiago, I grew to
admire and appreciate the man.

32:37.458 --> 32:39.042
I owe it to his memory

32:39.125 --> 32:41.708
to personally
oversee any inquiry.

32:42.792 --> 32:44.167
The first shuttle out, captain.

32:44.250 --> 32:46.125
And I want all transcripts, vid

32:46.208 --> 32:48.917
and background material
sent with him.

32:49.000 --> 32:51.625
I need to have everything
right at my fingertips.

32:51.708 --> 32:53.208
Yes, sir.
Of course, sir.

32:53.292 --> 32:55.542
- 'You're a good man, Sheridan.'
- Thank you.

32:55.625 --> 32:56.708
Good work on this.

32:56.792 --> 32:59.292
To you and your
chief of security.

32:59.375 --> 33:02.625
I'll keep you informed
of anything we find.

33:02.708 --> 33:03.792
Earthdome, out.

33:04.792 --> 33:06.833
[intense music]

33:12.708 --> 33:14.417
[intense music]

33:25.167 --> 33:27.417
We've reached the hyperspace
intersection which corresponds

33:27.500 --> 33:29.833
to the target area, captain.

33:29.917 --> 33:31.417
Very well.

33:31.500 --> 33:33.708
Initiate jump point
into normal space.

33:34.875 --> 33:36.917
[pulsating]

33:41.208 --> 33:43.000
Pull back! Pull back!

33:44.583 --> 33:46.000
[explosion]

33:51.667 --> 33:53.458
[explosion]

33:57.125 --> 33:59.083
I'm afraid to say
that the ship dispatched

33:59.167 --> 34:02.583
to investigate Z'ha'dum
has been destroyed.

34:02.667 --> 34:05.625
They're reporting it as an
accident with the jump engines

34:05.708 --> 34:08.458
since it happened
just as they left hyperspace.

34:08.542 --> 34:10.208
The Kha'Ri says it cannot afford

34:10.292 --> 34:11.958
to send another ship
for sometime.

34:12.042 --> 34:13.542
No, I won't accept this.

34:13.625 --> 34:16.375
This cannot
have been an accident.

34:16.458 --> 34:18.792
When a warship jumps
to normal space, it's briefly

34:18.875 --> 34:20.792
out of contact
because of the energy drain.

34:20.875 --> 34:23.542
It might've been attacked
during that period.

34:23.625 --> 34:26.292
But that couldn't happen
unless..

34:26.375 --> 34:27.875
...unless they knew
the ship was coming

34:27.958 --> 34:29.000
and were waiting for it.

34:29.083 --> 34:30.708
But no one knew except..

34:32.333 --> 34:34.375
[dramatic music]

34:37.583 --> 34:40.333
What exactly are you
implying, ambassador?

34:41.125 --> 34:43.708
[sighs]
Nothing.

34:43.792 --> 34:45.625
I'm too late.

34:45.708 --> 34:47.500
Everything is too late.

34:51.292 --> 34:53.542
If I may address the council?

34:55.458 --> 34:57.333
Yes, Mr. Lennier?

34:57.417 --> 35:00.417
Ambassador Delenn has been
unavailable of late.

35:00.500 --> 35:02.583
'She has now returned
and wishes to know'

35:02.667 --> 35:04.917
if she may take back her seat
on the council.

35:07.125 --> 35:09.167
Well, well, yes. Of course.

35:09.250 --> 35:11.167
Please, have her come in.

35:11.250 --> 35:12.917
I've been looking forward
to meeting her.

35:15.125 --> 35:16.958
[instrumental music]

35:43.792 --> 35:46.917
Ambassador Sinclair has been
allowed to live on my world

35:47.000 --> 35:49.000
as an act of good faith.

35:49.083 --> 35:50.542
To create
a greater understanding

35:50.625 --> 35:52.458
between Minbari and humans.

35:53.500 --> 35:54.917
'In return..'

35:55.000 --> 35:58.333
...I have undergone this change

35:58.417 --> 36:00.708
with the blessings
of my government.

36:00.792 --> 36:03.875
'So that I may become
a bridge between our worlds'

36:03.958 --> 36:07.792
in the hope that we will never
know war between us again.

36:13.708 --> 36:16.333
And all I could do was sit there

36:16.417 --> 36:18.292
my jaw on the floor,
looking at her.

36:18.375 --> 36:20.250
I can't say as I blame you.

36:20.333 --> 36:22.083
Has her genetic structure
changed as well

36:22.167 --> 36:23.792
or just her outward appearance?

36:23.875 --> 36:26.042
I don't know,
but, uh, she didn't seem

36:26.125 --> 36:28.208
too inclined to talk about it.

36:29.083 --> 36:31.125
God, what a day.

36:31.208 --> 36:34.375
Garibaldi, the President
and now this.

36:35.500 --> 36:38.125
And it's not quite over yet.

36:38.208 --> 36:39.417
Hmm?

36:39.500 --> 36:41.250
Uh, when I decided
to come see you

36:41.333 --> 36:43.417
I brought something with me.

36:43.500 --> 36:46.417
I've been debating over whether
or not to show it to you.

36:46.500 --> 36:47.958
'Not sure if it would
open old wounds'

36:48.042 --> 36:50.583
but after our talk the other day

36:50.667 --> 36:51.792
and you blaming yourself

36:51.875 --> 36:53.958
for Anna taking that job
on the Icarus..

36:55.750 --> 36:57.458
...I think it's something
you ought to see.

36:58.875 --> 37:00.542
It's part of a message
Anna sent to me

37:00.625 --> 37:03.333
about a week
before she passed away.

37:08.042 --> 37:10.125
I'll be in my quarters
if you wanna talk.

37:25.458 --> 37:26.542
[beep]

37:27.333 --> 37:28.792
Play.

37:28.875 --> 37:30.125
(Anna on TV)
'Oh, well,
maybe we'll have the chance'

37:30.208 --> 37:31.458
to try again later.

37:31.542 --> 37:33.458
I'm really excited
about signing onboard

37:33.542 --> 37:35.000
the Icarus next week.

37:35.083 --> 37:37.542
John and I were suppose
to spend some time together

37:37.625 --> 37:39.667
'but Dr. Chang thinks
he's found the ruins'

37:39.750 --> 37:42.750
'to an ancient civilization
nobody's ever heard of before.'

37:42.833 --> 37:45.500
'The chance to be there
when the discovery is confirmed'

37:45.583 --> 37:48.792
is just too good
an opportunity to pass up.

37:48.875 --> 37:50.750
I had already decided
to put off our vacation

37:50.833 --> 37:52.333
and go when John called
to tell me

37:52.417 --> 37:54.833
'that he had to cancel,
so it worked out just great.'

37:54.917 --> 37:57.500
'But the poor dear looked so
upset about breaking the news.'

37:57.583 --> 37:59.792
'I wanted to tell him
I was going away anyway'

37:59.875 --> 38:02.333
but I, we had so much
else to cover

38:02.417 --> 38:03.792
and there's never enough time.

38:03.875 --> 38:07.500
I'll just have to fill him in
when I get back.

38:07.583 --> 38:08.708
[sighs]

38:08.792 --> 38:10.667
'You got quite
a brother there, Liz.'

38:10.750 --> 38:14.375
'I can't tell you how,
how lucky I feel sometimes.'

38:14.458 --> 38:16.250
'Even when he's not here.'

38:16.333 --> 38:18.250
'I just..'

38:18.333 --> 38:21.542
Someone said that love
knows no borders..

38:21.625 --> 38:24.542
...and ours certainly
proves the point.

38:24.625 --> 38:27.375
'Well, I'll check in with you
when I get back.'

38:27.458 --> 38:30.042
'But with any luck, you'll hear
about it on the news first.'

38:30.125 --> 38:33.042
My love to Danny
and the kids. Bye.

38:34.833 --> 38:36.667
[instrumental music]

38:43.625 --> 38:45.292
Goodbye.

38:50.000 --> 38:51.292
I love you, Anna.

39:02.000 --> 39:04.417
Listen, I want to thank you
again for helpin' out.

39:04.500 --> 39:06.750
It's not a problem.

39:06.833 --> 39:08.167
It's still not admissible
in court.

39:08.250 --> 39:09.750
(Michael)
'Oh, don't worry about it.'

39:09.833 --> 39:11.333
Now that you jogged
the old memory loose

39:11.417 --> 39:12.875
I can take it from here.

39:12.958 --> 39:16.667
And, uh, speakin' of takin' it
from here, can I have a minute?

39:16.750 --> 39:19.250
Oh, sure.
I'll see you later.

39:20.667 --> 39:24.250
- If I you want I can--
- No, no, no. It's okay.

39:24.333 --> 39:26.292
I just didn't want her
to hear this.

39:26.375 --> 39:28.417
Well, I trust her as much
as I trust any telepath

39:28.500 --> 39:29.833
but she's still Psi Corps.

39:29.917 --> 39:32.417
What does the corps
have to do with this?

39:32.500 --> 39:34.417
I've been thinkin' about this
little salute Jack gave me

39:34.500 --> 39:38.250
back in a cell, same as that
Psi Cop Bester gave.

39:38.333 --> 39:39.958
'It's like he was rubbin'
my nose in something'

39:40.042 --> 39:42.167
'he knew I could never prove.'

39:42.250 --> 39:43.917
Remember the last election
there was a big scandal

39:44.000 --> 39:46.125
about the corps endorsing
Vice President Clark?

39:46.208 --> 39:48.250
Sure, it was big news
made all the nets.

39:48.333 --> 39:50.083
Their charter prohibits them
from recommending

39:50.167 --> 39:51.208
candidates to their members.

39:51.292 --> 39:52.792
Exactly.

39:52.875 --> 39:54.458
And Jack didn't admit anything.

39:54.542 --> 39:56.292
But he did say that
the Homeguard wasn't behind

39:56.375 --> 39:58.958
President Santiago's
assassination.

39:59.042 --> 40:00.958
But what if it was
the Psi Corps?

40:01.042 --> 40:02.208
'What if they wanted
someone in office'

40:02.292 --> 40:04.375
'who's sympathetic
to the corps?'

40:04.458 --> 40:06.750
Right before Earthforce One
exploded the vice president

40:06.833 --> 40:08.875
got off at Mars
saying he had the flu.

40:08.958 --> 40:10.125
It's pretty convenient,
isn't it?

40:11.917 --> 40:13.458
You'll write
every once in a while.

40:13.542 --> 40:16.500
- Let me know how you are.
- Yes, yes. Of course.

40:16.583 --> 40:20.208
(male #5 on speaker)
'Earth cruiser Von Braun
announcing final boarding.'

40:20.292 --> 40:22.167
'Please proceed to gate 3.'

40:22.250 --> 40:23.333
That's my ship.

40:24.500 --> 40:26.083
Take care, Johnny.

40:28.000 --> 40:30.042
You, too, huh?

40:30.125 --> 40:31.250
Thanks for comin'.

40:32.500 --> 40:34.250
Thanks for everything.

40:34.333 --> 40:35.917
You're my brother.

40:41.417 --> 40:43.333
[indistinct chatter]

40:49.583 --> 40:51.500
[beeping]
Sheridan.

40:51.583 --> 40:54.333
(Susan over speaker)
'Ivanova to Sheridan.
You're needed in C&amp;C.'

40:54.417 --> 40:56.292
Be right there.

40:56.375 --> 40:57.750
Things have changed,
Na'Toth.

40:57.833 --> 41:00.250
And they will
never be the same.

41:00.333 --> 41:02.333
'But we are Narns.'

41:02.417 --> 41:04.833
We have learned to cope
with change.

41:04.917 --> 41:07.208
To triumph
in the face of adversity.

41:07.292 --> 41:09.542
We will overcome this as well.

41:09.625 --> 41:11.750
[chuckles]
We have no other choice.

41:14.042 --> 41:15.208
What is that?

41:15.292 --> 41:16.458
A human book.

41:16.542 --> 41:19.083
I've been studying
their literature for a while

41:19.167 --> 41:21.833
and I came across this.

41:21.917 --> 41:25.542
It would seem they may be wiser
than we had thought.

41:25.625 --> 41:26.875
'Listen.'

41:28.000 --> 41:30.625
"Things fall apart.

41:30.708 --> 41:32.625
"The center cannot hold.

41:32.708 --> 41:35.583
"Mere anarchy is loosed
upon the world.

41:35.667 --> 41:38.125
"The blood-dimmed tide
is loosed.

41:38.208 --> 41:41.958
'"And everywhere
the ceremony of innocence'

41:42.042 --> 41:44.333
"is drowned.

41:44.417 --> 41:47.458
"And what rough beast..

41:47.542 --> 41:50.875
"...its hour come round
at last..

41:50.958 --> 41:53.375
"...slouches
toward Bethlehem..'

41:54.625 --> 41:56.417
...to be born."

41:59.958 --> 42:01.417
So what's the problem?

42:01.500 --> 42:03.250
On a hunch,
I just checked on the ship

42:03.333 --> 42:05.167
taking the prisoner
back to Earth.

42:05.250 --> 42:08.417
He was transferred to another
ship a half an hour ago.

42:08.500 --> 42:10.042
It had Earthforce
security markings

42:10.125 --> 42:12.917
it knew all the right access
and identification codes..

42:13.000 --> 42:15.500
...had papers
authorizing the transfer.

42:15.583 --> 42:17.583
But I just backtracked
with Earth Central.

42:17.667 --> 42:21.208
The ID codes don't match any
ship registered to Earthforce.

42:21.292 --> 42:23.917
Oh, great.

42:24.000 --> 42:26.917
So he's gone and all
the evidence with him.

42:27.000 --> 42:29.333
I'm afraid so.

42:29.417 --> 42:31.958
Have you notified
President Clark?

42:32.042 --> 42:33.792
He's not taking any calls.

42:34.667 --> 42:36.708
[intense music]

42:45.083 --> 42:46.542
Gets cold up here sometimes

42:46.625 --> 42:47.833
doesn't it,
lieutenant commander?

42:49.375 --> 42:50.458
Yes, sir.

42:51.708 --> 42:53.458
- It does indeed.
- Hmm.

42:56.333 --> 42:58.125
[music continues]

43:08.625 --> 43:10.167
[theme music]
