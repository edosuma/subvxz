00:12.200 --> 00:14.320
"Previously on" 24.

00:14.400 --> 00:18.560
You've already been briefed on the Cordilla
virus that is now threatening our cities.

00:18.680 --> 00:20.560
A vial of that virus
has already been released.

00:20.640 --> 00:22.920
We discovered the identity
of the perpetrator.

00:23.000 --> 00:25.480
His name is Stephen Saunders,
and he's a former Ml-6 agent.

00:25.600 --> 00:27.760
In 32 countries across
the Middle East and Asia...

00:27.840 --> 00:30.320
your government employs
intelligence consultants.

00:30.440 --> 00:33.880
They're spies. In 45 minutes,
I want a list of their identities.

00:34.040 --> 00:38.680
If you fail to comply, I will release
two vials of the virus in major cities.

00:38.760 --> 00:41.640
- Looks like Saunders has a daughter.
- A daughter?

00:41.760 --> 00:44.840
We know she's 19 years old.
She goes to school in Santa Barbara.

00:44.920 --> 00:47.280
I was just about to call the Santa Barbara
office to have her picked up.

00:47.360 --> 00:50.520
Tony, that's not the right play.
If you wanna grab her for questioning...

00:50.600 --> 00:53.000
you're gonna have to do it without him knowing,
which means we have to conduct...

00:53.120 --> 00:55.760
a plain-sight swap... switch her out
with one of our own agents.

00:55.840 --> 01:00.000
Okay. Let's see her.
Okay, now remember, Kim.

01:00.120 --> 01:03.440
- "You're not gonna fool anyone"
who knows Jane up close.
- I know.

01:09.360 --> 01:11.240
Clear.

01:13.600 --> 01:16.000
Do you think I'm playing
a game here with you?

01:16.120 --> 01:18.080
Hundreds of thousands of
peoples' lives are on the line.

01:18.200 --> 01:21.960
You have no idea how far I'm willing to go
to acquire your cooperation.

01:22.040 --> 01:23.960
- "Where is your father, Jane?"
- "I don't know!"

01:24.040 --> 01:27.200
- Could you, uh, help me
find something down this aisle?
- Yeah. No problem.

01:27.320 --> 01:29.080
You call for help,
I'll kill you right now.

01:29.160 --> 01:31.440
Kim. Damn it!

01:37.760 --> 01:40.600
Saunders is going to know
we have his daughter.

01:43.160 --> 01:47.200
The following takes place
between 8:00 a.m. and 9:00 a.m.

01:48.880 --> 01:51.720
These are the quarantine zones
that were set up an hour ago. Since then...

01:51.840 --> 01:56.920
two new, symptomatic patients were discovered
at an E.R. In Silver Lake and Hancock Park.

01:57.040 --> 01:59.840
Those two cases engendered
five new quarantine areas.

01:59.960 --> 02:01.840
That's three percent of the city.

02:01.960 --> 02:06.560
If containment isn't total,
it'll grow exponentially.

02:06.680 --> 02:09.160
Right. Uh, thanks, Adam.

02:12.560 --> 02:17.720
We're all tired. I know that. Some of you
have been working for 24 hours straight.

02:17.800 --> 02:20.720
So I don't have to tell you
how serious the situation is.

02:20.840 --> 02:24.120
But we can't drift.

02:24.280 --> 02:27.560
If there ever was a worst-case scenario,
this is it. We're in it.

02:27.640 --> 02:30.640
Everyone has to stay on point.

02:30.760 --> 02:32.840
We've switched from
prevention to containment.

02:32.960 --> 02:34.240
The virus is out.

02:34.360 --> 02:35.760
- " I'll start a workup."
- " Okay."

02:45.160 --> 02:47.440
All the way back,
other side of the road.

02:47.520 --> 02:49.520
- You all right?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

02:52.120 --> 02:54.080
I'm sorry it had to go down like this.

02:54.200 --> 02:56.560
The man I shot, is he dead?

02:56.640 --> 02:58.640
Yeah.

03:01.600 --> 03:04.960
What's gonna happen now?
Saunders is gonna know we haveJane.

03:08.800 --> 03:11.240
- This is Jack.
- Jack, it's Forrester.

03:11.360 --> 03:13.560
The Saunders girl's calmed down.
You can try talking to her again.

03:13.640 --> 03:16.080
Okay. Thanks, Rachel.

03:16.200 --> 03:19.000
We'll see what
we can get from the daughter.

03:25.760 --> 03:27.560
- I understand that, Tony.
- So you'll tell him?

03:27.680 --> 03:30.640
- Yeah. I'll tell him.
- " We should deploy C.D.C."
In underlying areas as well?

03:30.760 --> 03:32.600
- I want every precaution taken.
- I'll get back to you.

03:32.680 --> 03:34.120
Yeah.

03:36.360 --> 03:40.480
- What's going on with Jack Bauer?
- The operation wasn't completely successful.

03:40.600 --> 03:44.280
Now, David, they do have Saunders's daughter,
but they were unable to remain covert.

03:44.360 --> 03:46.280
- So Saunders knows we have her?
- No. Not yet.

03:46.400 --> 03:48.840
But C.T.U. Is estimating
he'll find out within the hour.

03:48.960 --> 03:52.880
- What's Jack's plan?
- Use Saunders's daughter to try to locate him.

03:54.760 --> 03:59.040
David, listen. The deadline for his next demand
is gonna be up in about 15 minutes.

03:59.160 --> 04:03.240
Giving this guy a list of every foreign
operative on our payroll is an act of treason.

04:03.360 --> 04:06.640
I know that, but he'll release
more of the virus if we don't.

04:08.240 --> 04:10.400
So what do you wanna do?

04:12.960 --> 04:15.520
I wanna see what Bauer gets out
of Saunders's daughter first.

04:25.760 --> 04:27.600
You know what just happened?

04:27.680 --> 04:33.040
A man who your father hired to protect you,
just tried to kill one of my agents.

04:33.160 --> 04:35.960
So you killed him, right?

04:36.040 --> 04:38.560
The man that worked for my father.

04:38.680 --> 04:42.320
You're a smart girl, Jane.
Look out in that room.

04:42.400 --> 04:46.080
Everyone here is a federal agent whose job
is to protect the lives of American citizens.

04:48.360 --> 04:50.720
I know how hard it must be
for you to believe everything...

04:50.840 --> 04:53.320
that everybody's been
telling you about your father.

04:53.440 --> 04:56.320
But I'm going to show you some things
that'll change your mind.

04:56.480 --> 05:00.240
The sooner you stop resisting me, the sooner
you can help us start saving lives.

05:00.320 --> 05:03.920
Why are you putting all this on me?

05:04.000 --> 05:06.880
Because you're Stephen Saunders's daughter.

05:06.960 --> 05:09.640
And, unfortunately, you're
the only leverage we have against him.

05:09.760 --> 05:14.080
You can't just say these outrageous things
and expect me to believe you.

05:14.200 --> 05:16.640
I know.

05:16.760 --> 05:20.080
Truth is, l... I knew your father.

05:20.200 --> 05:23.520
I worked with him.

05:23.640 --> 05:27.040
He was a good man.
He was a brave man.

05:27.160 --> 05:30.600
But something's happened to him.

05:30.720 --> 05:33.960
All I care about right now is stopping him
from doing what he's doing.

05:34.080 --> 05:37.280
I can't do that without you.
I need your help.

05:42.880 --> 05:44.720
Palmer still hasn't sent the list yet.

05:44.800 --> 05:47.040
He has 15 more minutes.

05:47.160 --> 05:51.880
C. T.U. Is trying to use I.P. Locators to
get at you through the domain name.

05:52.000 --> 05:55.360
- We're protected though, right?
- Yes. It's a dead end.

05:55.520 --> 05:57.920
Good.

06:01.320 --> 06:03.160
Thank you.

06:07.680 --> 06:10.320
I'm gonna show you
who your father really is.

06:12.360 --> 06:15.200
These photographs
were taken over eight years ago.

06:15.360 --> 06:18.760
Your father told your mother that he was going
to Europe on a fact-finding mission.

06:18.880 --> 06:21.120
The truth is we were both part
of a Special Forces unit...

06:21.200 --> 06:24.040
that was dispatched to Kosovo
to kill a man name Victor Drazen.

06:24.160 --> 06:26.600
This is where the mission ended.
Drazen's hideout.

06:26.720 --> 06:30.400
When I left Kosovo, I believed
your father had died in the blast.

06:30.480 --> 06:32.520
The British government told your mother
that's where he died too.

06:32.640 --> 06:35.120
But recently, we discovered through
phone records that your father...

06:35.240 --> 06:37.880
had contacted you four years ago
to tell you he was still alive.

06:37.960 --> 06:40.800
- Is that right?
- Yes.

06:42.600 --> 06:46.400
A couple of months after my mother died,
I got a call from him.

06:46.520 --> 06:51.120
He said he was living in Europe under an
assumed name, and nobody knew he was alive.

06:53.560 --> 06:57.320
And for his protection, I couldn't tell
anyone that I had spoken to him.

06:57.440 --> 07:00.960
Did he ever tell you why he contacted you
after so many years?

07:01.120 --> 07:03.000
Yes.

07:04.800 --> 07:06.600
He missed me.

07:08.840 --> 07:12.000
I understand that.

07:12.120 --> 07:16.320
Over the last three to four hours,
we've been pulling data from Interpol.

07:16.440 --> 07:18.240
Here are some more recent images.

07:18.360 --> 07:20.320
This is your father with Siad Kolobe...

07:20.480 --> 07:23.240
a known weapons dealer
in the Middle East.

07:23.360 --> 07:26.560
Here he's seen meeting with Ari Consul,
a biologist from Jakarta...

07:26.680 --> 07:28.800
who's spending the rest of
his life in prison for the manufacturing of...

07:28.920 --> 07:32.200
- illegal biological weapons.
- This doesn't prove anything.

07:32.320 --> 07:34.720
He could've been meeting with these people
for any number of reasons.

07:34.800 --> 07:38.480
I'll play you an audio file. One of three that
we got from your father earlier today.

07:38.560 --> 07:41.720
This is your father talking to
the president of the United States.

07:41.800 --> 07:45.960
Working against those countries at
the behest of the American military machine.

07:46.080 --> 07:51.440
In 45 minutes, I want a list of their
identities sent to me by way of a Web site...

07:51.560 --> 07:54.240
sylviaimports.com.

07:54.360 --> 07:59.440
If you fail to comply, I will release
two vials of the virus in major cities.

07:59.520 --> 08:01.920
Two more vials of the virus.
He's already released one.

08:02.080 --> 08:05.200
This is a live video feed from
the Chandler Plaza Hotel in Los Angeles...

08:05.280 --> 08:08.520
where your father ordered the release
of one of the vials of the virus...

08:08.640 --> 08:10.400
into the ventilation system of the hotel.

08:10.520 --> 08:13.320
The people you're looking at will be dead
within the next two to three hours.

08:13.440 --> 08:15.840
Almost 800 of them are infected, Jane.

08:15.960 --> 08:18.080
This is how they'll die.

08:25.800 --> 08:30.040
- I don't wanna see any more.
- I don't wanna see any more either.

08:30.120 --> 08:33.480
You can help us stop this, Jane. Please.

08:33.600 --> 08:35.200
Please.

08:46.480 --> 08:49.480
I have a phone number.

08:49.600 --> 08:52.880
He told me to call it day or night
if I ever got in trouble.

08:52.960 --> 08:56.320
- Have you ever used it before?
- No.

08:56.440 --> 08:59.120
We need it.

09:03.960 --> 09:08.160
No! No! It's a mistake!

09:08.280 --> 09:12.720
- No, it's not.
- I'm okay! I don't have any infection!

09:12.840 --> 09:17.200
No! Don't take me in there with
those people! I don't wanna die!

09:19.560 --> 09:21.600
I don't wanna die!

09:57.440 --> 10:00.360
Michelle, I just got a call.
Your lab results are on their way here.

10:29.480 --> 10:31.560
I'm sorry to interrupt, Mr. President.

10:34.360 --> 10:37.880
- What is this, Aaron?
- Our bureau chief just informed me...

10:38.000 --> 10:40.960
that N.H.S. believes
Los Angeles is no longer safe.

10:41.080 --> 10:43.240
We would like to
move you out of the state.

10:44.840 --> 10:47.080
I appreciate your concern.

10:47.200 --> 10:50.360
Tell Chief Kurtzman
I'd rather manage matters from here.

10:50.440 --> 10:53.880
Sir, I'm afraid this isn't a request.

10:54.000 --> 10:56.040
Excuse me?

10:56.160 --> 10:58.520
Secret Service is invoking Section 32.

10:58.600 --> 11:03.240
For your own protection, we are requiring
you to accompany us to Air Force One.

11:05.640 --> 11:10.360
- You're ordering me?
- Yes, sir. It's for your safety.

11:10.480 --> 11:12.680
- Wayne?
- I don't know the specifics of the code...

11:12.800 --> 11:15.400
but it seems Secret Service is invoking it.

11:15.520 --> 11:17.960
And, David, here in L.A.,
the threat is serious.

11:18.080 --> 11:21.320
It's serious everywhere. At least here
we know what we're facing.

11:21.400 --> 11:23.440
Who has to sign off on this, Aaron?

11:23.560 --> 11:25.440
Chief Kurtzman and myself.

11:35.040 --> 11:36.920
I'd like a word
in private with you, Aaron.

11:47.520 --> 11:50.880
Sir, I'm sorry for appearing
to overstep my bounds.

11:51.000 --> 11:54.440
It's my job to protect you.

11:54.600 --> 11:57.560
Listen, Aaron, you've been with me
from the beginning.

11:57.680 --> 12:00.520
You don't have to apologize
for doing your job.

12:00.600 --> 12:03.560
But this crisis will end.

12:03.720 --> 12:07.160
And the people in this city,
in this country...

12:07.280 --> 12:11.080
will be stronger knowing that their president
stood by them shoulder to shoulder.

12:13.640 --> 12:19.040
I'm asking you as a friend
and a fellow citizen, protect me...

12:20.520 --> 12:22.680
but here in Los Angeles.

12:26.640 --> 12:29.000
Can you do that for me?

12:30.920 --> 12:34.400
Yes, sir. For you I can.

12:35.800 --> 12:38.720
- Thank you.
- Yes, sir.

12:53.800 --> 12:56.640
Mr. President,
the conference call is about to begin.

13:02.680 --> 13:05.240
- "Jack, you there?"
- Yeah, I'm on.

13:05.360 --> 13:08.200
- Mr. President?
- Mr. Almeida...

13:08.320 --> 13:11.800
I understand we may have a way to locate
this man, Stephen Saunders.

13:11.920 --> 13:15.120
Yes, sir, we do. However, my
technical staff just informed me...

13:15.240 --> 13:18.920
that to do so properly,
may take 15 minutes, possibly longer.

13:19.040 --> 13:21.400
So there's no way we can get to him
in the next few minutes?

13:21.520 --> 13:23.920
No, sir, there's not.

13:26.720 --> 13:29.160
Okay, gentlemen, time is upon us.

13:29.280 --> 13:32.240
Having considered
all the possible scenarios...

13:32.360 --> 13:35.240
I see no other choice
than to draw our line in the sand.

13:35.320 --> 13:39.280
I will not give in
to Saunders's latest demand.

13:39.400 --> 13:42.280
Mr. President, I hope you understand that
that leaves us with only one option.

13:42.400 --> 13:46.200
That's to use Stephen Saunders's daughter
as a hostage and hope that that'll stop him.

13:46.320 --> 13:50.440
I understand.
All right, gentlemen, get to it.

13:50.560 --> 13:53.400
- " Yes, Mr. President."
- " Yes, sir."

13:53.520 --> 13:57.320
David, are you sure
we're doing the right thing?

13:57.440 --> 14:01.200
The only thing I'm sure of is we cannot let
this country be taken over by this madman.

14:03.760 --> 14:05.240
How do you wanna do this?

14:05.360 --> 14:07.880
How long do we have to
keep him on so we can run a trace?

14:08.000 --> 14:11.760
- About a minute.
- Okay. We need to cover our bases.

14:11.920 --> 14:14.880
We'll use Jane to try and keep him on
the line. If we have to jump in, we will.

14:15.000 --> 14:18.120
All right. I'll initiate the trace,
you tellJane what we need her to do.

14:18.200 --> 14:20.920
I'll get back to you. Damn it.

14:24.800 --> 14:29.000
- What's happening?
- We've run out of time.
We need you to call your father.

14:29.120 --> 14:32.520
- And tell him what?
- Anything. We just want you
to keep him on the line.

14:32.640 --> 14:35.800
- For how long?
- "At least a minute."

14:35.920 --> 14:39.680
- Do you think you can do that?
- I need to think about it.

14:39.800 --> 14:41.600
Jane, we don't have any more time.

14:41.680 --> 14:45.160
Your father just threatened to release more
of the virus in the next few minutes.

14:51.280 --> 14:53.680
- Is the list up yet?
- No.

14:55.040 --> 14:57.720
Well, his time is up.

14:59.840 --> 15:02.040
Hello.

15:02.160 --> 15:04.160
- It's me.
- Yes?

15:04.280 --> 15:07.040
- Release San Francisco.
- I understand.

15:08.760 --> 15:11.600
That's my daughter's line. Ian, wait.

15:11.720 --> 15:14.040
- I'll call you right back.
- All right.

15:16.920 --> 15:19.600
"Find out where this is coming from."

15:23.840 --> 15:26.680
- Jane.
- Yeah.

15:27.840 --> 15:30.640
- Hi, Dad.
- "What's wrong?"

15:30.720 --> 15:32.680
I told you only to
use this number in an emergency.

15:32.800 --> 15:36.720
I wanna see you. I'm scared.

15:36.880 --> 15:39.680
The airports are shut down,
and the news channels are talking about...

15:39.760 --> 15:42.960
- the alert level being raised.
- Just stay where you are, honey.

15:43.040 --> 15:46.840
- You'll be fine.
- Someone is monitoring the call.

15:46.960 --> 15:49.360
Hang on a second, honey.

15:50.960 --> 15:53.480
- You sure?
- Yes, the signal's splitting.

15:56.240 --> 16:00.040
- They've got her.
- "Jack, we just got a hit on the trace route."

16:00.120 --> 16:02.160
- He knows we're on the phone.
- What do I do when he gets back on?

16:02.320 --> 16:04.640
Nothing. You're doing great.
Just keep talking.

16:09.040 --> 16:11.440
- Jane?
- Yes, Dad?

16:11.600 --> 16:16.000
There's a man named Jack Bauer
with you, isn't there?

16:16.120 --> 16:20.400
- What, Dad?
- Hand the phone to him.

16:20.520 --> 16:22.080
- Dad...
- You heard me.

16:28.880 --> 16:32.520
- I'm on the line, Stephen.
- Jack...

16:32.600 --> 16:36.240
you know how many vials I have
and what I am capable of.

16:43.920 --> 16:47.080
You know what I'm capable of too.

16:50.520 --> 16:53.800
- You get a lock on the signal?
- It's dead.
We're negative for passive triangulation.

16:53.880 --> 16:56.360
- Tony, did you get him?
- We're working on it. Adam?

16:56.480 --> 16:59.600
I've got two microwaves. It can give me a
longitude reading, but I don't have the latitude.

16:59.680 --> 17:02.960
Here, try this.

17:05.880 --> 17:08.880
- Adam?
- I'm trying, Tony. I'm working on it.

17:12.800 --> 17:16.200
- Okay, here it is. 21904 Collins.
- Got him, Jack.

17:16.319 --> 17:19.240
- We'll send teams from here.
- Okay. Patch the location through to the chopper.

17:19.359 --> 17:21.359
- We'll be airborne in minutes.
- Get me Chase.

17:21.520 --> 17:24.839
They got a location.
Tell the chopper to come in.

17:24.960 --> 17:28.280
I want you to assemble a team. Take Jane
back to C.T.U. I want her fully protected.

17:29.360 --> 17:31.560
What are you gonna do to my father?

17:31.640 --> 17:34.480
We're gonna stop him.

17:36.320 --> 17:39.360
I want you to go with her.

17:52.840 --> 17:56.200
- We have to make sure that these stats
are updated and sent to C.T.U.
- Okay.

17:56.320 --> 17:58.640
- All right. When you're done with...
- Michelle.

17:58.720 --> 18:00.560
Test results. They just came in.

18:07.720 --> 18:09.200
Thank you.

18:58.040 --> 19:01.160
- Almeida.
- Honey, it's me.

19:01.240 --> 19:03.080
What's goin' on?

19:06.960 --> 19:11.000
I'm okay. I'm not infected.

19:11.120 --> 19:14.560
- Are you sure?
- Yeah. They did a swab and a blood test.

19:14.680 --> 19:17.840
I'm going to be fine.
I'm gonna be fine.

19:17.960 --> 19:22.360
My God. Oh, my God, sweetheart.
That's fantastic.

19:22.480 --> 19:26.640
Look, I want you to get out of there right
now, okay? Away from anybody who's infected.

19:26.720 --> 19:29.080
Uh, no. No. No, sweetheart.

19:29.200 --> 19:32.920
They said that those of us that didn't
come down with the infection...

19:33.040 --> 19:36.200
that we have an immunity to the virus.

19:36.280 --> 19:38.800
Well, where are they taking you?

19:38.920 --> 19:41.520
Downtown to N.H.S.

19:41.640 --> 19:44.400
They wanna keep us
under watch for 18 hours.

19:44.520 --> 19:46.480
But they said it's just a formality.

19:46.600 --> 19:51.120
All right, look. I'll get there
as soon as I can, all right?

19:51.200 --> 19:53.560
No. No. Stay where you are.
They need you at C.T.U.

19:53.680 --> 19:58.960
- "I can work from downtown."
- Honey, you don't have to work.
We can handle it from here.

19:59.080 --> 20:01.040
I wanna help, Tony.

20:03.360 --> 20:05.360
Okay.

20:07.160 --> 20:10.000
- Michelle?
- Yeah?

20:13.760 --> 20:15.840
I can't believe
I almost lost you.

20:18.480 --> 20:21.440
I almost lost you too.

20:21.560 --> 20:23.440
But we're still here.

20:25.480 --> 20:27.320
Yeah.

20:27.400 --> 20:31.640
I have to go. I'll call you from N.H.S.

20:31.760 --> 20:33.600
Hey.

20:34.600 --> 20:36.280
I love you.

20:38.240 --> 20:41.000
I love you so much.

21:01.960 --> 21:04.520
Excuse me, everybody. Can I
have your attention, please?

21:04.640 --> 21:07.920
The president has asked you to this
informal setting without cameras...

21:08.000 --> 21:11.000
or recording devices,
to tell you what relationship, if any...

21:11.120 --> 21:15.000
the outbreak at the Chandler Plaza Hotel
has with the airport closures.

21:15.120 --> 21:17.480
Was the Chandler Plaza the reason
the alert level was raised?

21:17.560 --> 21:20.760
The president will deal with that in his statement.

21:23.160 --> 21:25.680
- So Saunders knows we have his daughter?
- Yeah.

21:25.800 --> 21:28.640
- Found out about five minutes ago.
- How did he react?

21:28.760 --> 21:33.000
He broke off communication. The good news
is C.T.U. has a position on Saunders...

21:33.120 --> 21:36.560
- and they're sending in teams now.
- What's our confidence level?

21:36.680 --> 21:41.480
David, this man knows our system.
Our protocols. He's gonna be tough to corner.

21:41.600 --> 21:44.440
Stay on top of our
emergency response teams.

21:44.520 --> 21:47.000
The abduction of his daughter
may have made things worse.

21:48.520 --> 21:51.000
- The President of the United States.
- Please, be seated.

21:53.000 --> 21:58.200
As you know, this morning
our alert level was raised to red.

21:58.320 --> 22:01.840
We have information regarding a possible
biological attack on American soil.

22:01.960 --> 22:04.480
We have maximized
our preparedness across the nation.

22:04.600 --> 22:09.160
Now the best way for our citizens
to ensure their own safety...

22:09.240 --> 22:10.800
is to stay home.

22:10.920 --> 22:12.800
If you're at work, go home.

22:12.920 --> 22:15.120
That's the message
I hope the media can convey.

22:15.200 --> 22:18.600
Mr. President, we've heard reports that
the local British Intelligence office...

22:18.720 --> 22:20.360
was attacked a couple of hours ago.

22:20.480 --> 22:23.800
- Is that related?
- I can't release any details on that right now.

22:23.920 --> 22:28.720
I'm sorry. Mr. President, the people of the
city of Los Angeles are starting to panic...

22:28.840 --> 22:30.880
and information
is not flowing from this office.

22:31.000 --> 22:35.240
We've had major outbreaks. We've had
quarantines, and now a hint of biological terror...

22:35.320 --> 22:38.600
- "Carol, please."
- No, Jerry. No. The president
has got to be more forthcoming.

22:38.680 --> 22:43.920
It's okay. The president has to be
in control, and so do you.

22:45.360 --> 22:48.080
If you wanna help the public
and do your jobs best...

22:48.160 --> 22:51.000
sit quietly and listen to
what I have to say.

22:51.120 --> 22:55.080
Biological agents do their worst damage...

22:55.200 --> 22:57.560
where large groups of people congregate.

22:57.640 --> 23:00.000
The best defense we have right now...

23:00.120 --> 23:03.400
is to encourage everyone to go home...

23:03.480 --> 23:05.920
and stay home
and await further instructions.

23:06.040 --> 23:07.800
Mr. President,
one more question, please.

23:10.200 --> 23:12.040
Chase, it's Jack. Are you en route?

23:12.120 --> 23:14.280
Yeah. I'm a little more
than 10 minutes out.

23:14.360 --> 23:17.240
Jack, what are the chances
Saunders knows we have his location?

23:17.320 --> 23:19.880
Not likely. Saunders'll think he had
90 seconds more talk time...

23:20.000 --> 23:21.920
before we could ever
lock onto his location.

23:22.040 --> 23:23.960
I want you to move
your teams into position...

23:24.040 --> 23:26.040
and remind local law enforcement
to stay out of sight.

23:26.160 --> 23:29.240
- "We cannot tip him off."
- Done.

23:29.360 --> 23:33.040
Adam, keep an eye on the satellite. Track
anyone coming in and out of that building...

23:33.120 --> 23:35.600
and feed all that information
over to local law enforcement.

23:35.720 --> 23:37.200
- Do you copy?
- I'm watching the data now, Jack.

23:37.320 --> 23:39.480
- Okay. Plug Chloe into it too.
- Yeah.

23:39.560 --> 23:43.800
Listen, everybody this is our time.
Get it right.

23:43.920 --> 23:46.600
- Stephen, we have to leave.
- We're not leaving.

23:46.680 --> 23:49.480
Why not?
You said they probably know our location.

23:49.560 --> 23:52.280
- Not probably, they do.
- I don't understand.

23:52.360 --> 23:56.440
They've got us on satellite.
They'll pick us up if we try to leave now.

23:56.520 --> 23:59.640
- So we sit around here and
wait till they surround us?
- Exactly.

23:59.760 --> 24:02.800
The more bodies they send, the easier
it will be for us to disappear.

24:02.920 --> 24:05.280
No. I'm not waiting around
to get caught.

24:05.400 --> 24:07.880
- Osterlind!
- "I'm leaving, Stephen."

24:28.440 --> 24:30.480
Yeah.

24:30.600 --> 24:32.960
- Has she left yet?
- No.

24:33.080 --> 24:35.760
She will. Stay on her.

24:35.840 --> 24:38.840
- We're gonna need to do this soon.
- Okay.

24:42.080 --> 24:44.440
- Where are we going?
- Los Angeles.

24:44.560 --> 24:46.360
Your father said
there was an outbreak there.

24:46.480 --> 24:48.720
Where we're going, it'll be safe.
Don't worry.

24:48.800 --> 24:51.640
Can I ask you to step back,
please? Behind the line.

25:30.280 --> 25:33.760
- Where in Los Angeles are they taking me?
- A place called C.T.U.

25:33.880 --> 25:37.280
- C.T.U?
- Yeah. Counter Terrorist Unit.

25:41.360 --> 25:43.680
I still can't believe this.

25:46.520 --> 25:50.080
That my father is a terrorist.

25:52.240 --> 25:56.000
Four years ago when I found out
he was alive after all that time...

25:56.120 --> 25:58.520
I was so happy.

26:01.440 --> 26:03.360
I had a father.

26:07.480 --> 26:10.640
I let myself believe
all that he wanted me to.

26:13.080 --> 26:16.200
That he was this wonderful man.

26:18.480 --> 26:22.120
- How often did you see him?
- A couple times a year.

26:23.320 --> 26:26.480
Sometimes he'd surprise me...

26:26.560 --> 26:29.520
and he'd always bring me something.

26:32.320 --> 26:36.600
And it was always perfect... like he knew.

26:38.640 --> 26:41.600
- Maybe he did know.
- What do you mean?

26:41.760 --> 26:44.280
He had people watching you, Jane.

26:44.400 --> 26:47.360
He knew more about your life than
you're probably aware of.

26:51.080 --> 26:53.600
What am I supposed to do
with all these feelings for him?

26:56.520 --> 27:00.640
The person I love doesn't even exist.

27:04.960 --> 27:06.760
What's gonna happen to him?

27:08.480 --> 27:10.360
My dad's gonna try and bring him in.

27:16.720 --> 27:19.360
Adam, it's Jack. What's the status
of Saunders's location?

27:19.480 --> 27:21.440
I'm watching it now, Jack.
No one's left the building.

27:21.600 --> 27:24.880
- Who's working with us?
- L.A.P.D.'s set up a staging
area about a block away.

27:25.000 --> 27:27.680
They've surrounded the area
and are hidden from view.

27:27.800 --> 27:30.040
Okay. Good work. Tell them
I'll be there in a few minutes.

27:30.120 --> 27:33.880
- All right.
- That information's correct.

27:33.960 --> 27:36.480
- You're absolutely sure?
- I checked myself.

27:36.600 --> 27:38.960
Thank you very much.

27:41.840 --> 27:45.760
Code 43. What's the status
of the simulation on X-4?

27:45.920 --> 27:48.760
- Tony, I need to talk to you.
- Yeah. Just a second.

27:48.840 --> 27:51.800
- Why don't you put those
simulations on my system.
- I need to talk to you now.

27:53.120 --> 27:56.640
I'll catch up.
Go ahead. What is it?

27:56.800 --> 27:59.960
I've been working on
the tented quarantine areas, you know?

28:00.040 --> 28:03.120
- And?
- I've been going over the list
of people who've been isolated...

28:03.240 --> 28:05.600
- and I found a familiar name.
- And?

28:07.280 --> 28:09.120
One of them is Sarah Kaufman.

28:10.840 --> 28:12.920
- Who's Sarah Kaufman?
- Adam's sister.

28:15.560 --> 28:17.320
You're sure it's Adam's sister?

28:17.440 --> 28:22.080
Yeah. She tested positive,
in the medical sense. She's gonna die.

28:24.040 --> 28:26.880
All right. Thanks.

28:27.040 --> 28:29.560
- You're not gonna tell him, are you?
- Yeah, I have to.

28:29.680 --> 28:31.560
Well, we still have
a lot of work to do.

28:31.680 --> 28:34.880
How can he concentrate knowing his sister's
gonna die? Did ya ever think about that?

28:35.000 --> 28:38.960
Chloe, I'm getting
real tired of your personality.

28:39.080 --> 28:44.320
- I'm just trying to help.
- You wanna help? Get back to work.

28:52.160 --> 28:54.520
Adam. Would you
come with me for a second?

28:54.600 --> 28:57.120
I'm sitting on these satellite feeds
for Jack. Can it wait?

28:57.240 --> 29:00.040
No, it can't. Chloe will watch it.

29:00.160 --> 29:03.160
Fine. What is it?
Tony, I really have to stay on this.

29:03.280 --> 29:07.680
- It's personal. Come with me.
- Tony, whatever it is, tell me.
Did I do something wrong?

29:07.800 --> 29:10.880
No.

29:11.000 --> 29:13.920
I'm afraid I have
some bad news for you.

29:14.080 --> 29:16.640
Your sister Sarah's in one of
the quarantine zones.

29:16.760 --> 29:21.440
- What?
- You have a sister named Sarah, right?

29:21.560 --> 29:25.440
Yeah. But how can they be sure it's her?
There has to be a hundred Sarah Kaufmans in L.A.

29:25.560 --> 29:27.840
Chloe confirmed it.

29:29.640 --> 29:31.800
Have they kept her away from
the people that are infected?

29:33.320 --> 29:35.840
She's infected.

29:35.960 --> 29:38.560
What are you saying, Tony? Are you
telling me that Sarah's gonna die?

29:40.360 --> 29:44.160
It looks that way. Yeah. I'm sorry.

29:45.800 --> 29:47.520
Oh, my God.

29:49.560 --> 29:53.360
Look, Adam, I'm gonna give you
a chance to talk to your sister.

29:53.480 --> 29:57.240
But then I'm gonna need you to
stay on until the crisis passes.

29:57.320 --> 29:59.760
You think you can do that?

30:03.000 --> 30:04.960
Adam?

30:05.080 --> 30:08.120
'Cause we need you here.

30:08.240 --> 30:11.280
- Yeah.
- All right.

30:25.240 --> 30:27.880
- No other way out?
- No. I'm completely surrounded.

30:28.000 --> 30:29.600
How do you know?

30:29.720 --> 30:33.080
There was a security guard across the street.
He'd make his rounds every 15 minutes.

30:33.200 --> 30:38.080
He missed his last rotation, which means
C.T.U. Has taken over that building.

30:38.240 --> 30:40.600
What are you gonna do?

30:40.680 --> 30:43.200
I'm gonna wait until Bauer gets here.

30:45.160 --> 30:47.520
Baker and his team are running operations
from behind the building.

30:47.600 --> 30:49.960
They'll move when we tell them to.
L.A.P.D. set up a perimeter...

30:50.080 --> 30:51.680
here, here, here and here.

30:51.800 --> 30:55.440
We got SWAT teams moving in this way
and from over here, snipers on the roof.

30:55.520 --> 30:57.440
Nobody goes until we give
the word. Understand?

30:57.520 --> 31:01.280
- What's the situation?
- We've taken over the buildings
on either side of him.

31:01.440 --> 31:03.800
We've got snipers on the roof ready to go.

31:03.880 --> 31:06.240
- Phones?
- We didn't jam the area. You said he'd know.

31:06.360 --> 31:09.600
- What about infrared?
- Can't get through the walls, Jack.

31:17.280 --> 31:20.760
- He knows we're here.
- What makes you say that?

31:20.880 --> 31:24.640
- 'Cause I would.
- "You think he's still in there?"

31:24.760 --> 31:26.600
- Yeah.
- Why wouldn't he try to escape?

31:26.720 --> 31:29.080
I don't know. On my signal, I want you
to move your teams into position.

31:29.160 --> 31:32.800
Minimum three men per exit. Remember, no one
goes into the building till I give the order.

31:32.920 --> 31:35.960
We have to assume Saunders has taken
defensive measures. Everybody ready?

31:36.080 --> 31:38.720
- Yes, sir.
- Let's go.

31:38.840 --> 31:41.160
All teams move into first position.
This is a go. Repeat, this is a go.

32:04.160 --> 32:07.800
- " Position all set."
- Okay. Let's go.

32:40.160 --> 32:44.360
Stephen Saunders, it's Jack Bauer.

32:44.440 --> 32:48.080
You're completely surrounded.

32:48.200 --> 32:51.280
The president has refused to capitulate to
any further demands.

32:51.400 --> 32:54.840
I need to remind you that
we still have your daughter.

32:54.960 --> 32:59.320
Stephen, it's over.

32:59.440 --> 33:01.920
The only way you're getting
out of this thing alive...

33:02.040 --> 33:05.480
is coming through the front door
with your hands on your head.

33:06.920 --> 33:09.400
That's just not exactly true, Jack.

34:45.199 --> 34:47.719
- Adam.
- Not now, Chloe.

34:47.840 --> 34:50.199
I'm running comm
on the Saunders pickup.

34:50.280 --> 34:54.080
I know what you're doing. Robin, take over
Adam's screen for a minute. Come here.

34:54.199 --> 34:56.199
Why? Chloe, this is really not a good time.

34:56.360 --> 34:59.680
- Tony, you need to hear this.
- What?

34:59.800 --> 35:03.600
I have to report some bad news.
Field Ops lost two satellite feeds...

35:03.720 --> 35:05.960
because Adam forgot to
segregate the channels.

35:06.040 --> 35:08.680
- What are you talking about?
- It's true. I checked your system.

35:08.800 --> 35:10.760
- I had to reinitiate everything.
- You touched my system?

35:10.920 --> 35:13.280
Tony, let's face it.
Adam shouldn't be here.

35:13.400 --> 35:15.360
He's under duress because
his sister's gonna die.

35:15.480 --> 35:18.920
- I did not forget to separate those channels, Tony.
- Yes, you did.

35:19.080 --> 35:22.440
Look, we don't have time for this. We have
teams on the ground depending on us.

35:22.560 --> 35:25.400
- Now did you back up the satellite data?
- Yes, I reprogrammed everything.

35:25.480 --> 35:28.760
- We lost about 30 seconds.
- We didn't lose it, Chloe. I can prove it to you now.

35:39.280 --> 35:41.920
I thought that l...

35:42.040 --> 35:45.200
Chloe's right.
I forgot to separate them.

35:48.920 --> 35:52.120
All right, look.
You made a mistake.

35:52.200 --> 35:55.880
But what I need to know is if you can get
through the day without making another one?

35:57.800 --> 36:00.840
Adam?

36:01.000 --> 36:05.640
- I'm fine, Tony.
- Okay.

36:08.360 --> 36:10.760
I want you to know that I don't
agree with Tony's decision.

36:10.840 --> 36:13.360
Since you're gonna stay, I'm gonna
double-check your logs every 10 minutes...

36:13.480 --> 36:15.960
in case you screw up again.

36:28.120 --> 36:30.560
Jack, what do you wanna do?
If he's not in there...

36:30.680 --> 36:32.720
we're wasting a lot of time
we don't have.

36:32.840 --> 36:35.920
Just have the men maintain their position.

36:37.840 --> 36:40.520
- This is Bauer.
- Congratulations, Jack.

36:40.640 --> 36:44.760
- "You found me."
- Stephen, it's over. Come on out.

36:44.840 --> 36:48.800
It would suit me better
if you came in here and got me.

36:48.920 --> 36:52.600
I'd hate to be in the crosshairs of
all those unstable C.T.U. Snipers.

36:52.680 --> 36:56.200
Come out the front door with your hands
on your head. I assure you, you'll be fine.

36:56.360 --> 36:59.320
Eleven more vials, millions dead.

36:59.440 --> 37:01.480
That doesn't affect your nerves a little bit?

37:01.600 --> 37:06.080
The president's made himself clear.
He's not following orders from you anymore.

37:06.200 --> 37:10.120
- I work for him.
- Well, if that's the case...

37:10.280 --> 37:12.800
you won't mind if I take
a few minutes to think things over.

37:12.920 --> 37:14.760
While you're thinking things over...

37:14.840 --> 37:17.480
you might want to take a second
and think about your daughter.

37:19.240 --> 37:22.440
Tony just confirmed that he's in the building.

37:24.200 --> 37:28.040
All teams hold your position.
We got confirmation.

37:31.560 --> 37:35.320
Is it done?

37:35.440 --> 37:38.920
- Yes.
- All right. Stay on the line.

37:40.360 --> 37:44.040
Almeida.

37:44.120 --> 37:46.760
Listen to me very carefully,
Agent Almeida.

37:46.880 --> 37:49.720
- Who is this?
- It's Stephen Saunders.

37:49.840 --> 37:53.280
Before you make any tactical errors,
I'd like to give you an update on the situation.

37:53.400 --> 37:56.680
- I'm listening.
- I need you to move to a private area...

37:56.760 --> 38:00.440
- that has direct comm
with your teams on-site here.
- And why would I do that?

38:00.560 --> 38:05.480
Open a web socket to
I.P. 2-5-7-2-11-16-5...

38:05.600 --> 38:07.360
and you'll find out.

38:07.440 --> 38:11.560
That's I.P. 2-5-7-2-11-16-5.

38:11.640 --> 38:14.640
Just trust me. Do it.

38:18.200 --> 38:21.600
By the way, Tony, I'd like to offer you
congratulations on your wife...

38:21.720 --> 38:25.200
eluding infection from the virus.

38:25.320 --> 38:27.640
How do you know about my wife?

38:27.760 --> 38:30.320
Get on that site.

38:35.520 --> 38:37.880
I don't know exactly what
they're doing to her, Tony...

38:38.000 --> 38:41.920
but I did instruct them to leave her barely
functional so that we can return her to you.

38:42.040 --> 38:45.240
I'll kill you, you son of a bitch.
I'll rip your damn throat out...

38:45.360 --> 38:48.800
- you hear me?
- I'm low on time, so I'm sorry
if I brush past that remark.

38:48.920 --> 38:53.320
Because in 15 seconds, Michelle will be dead
if you don't do what I say.

38:56.960 --> 39:00.240
There are five agents watching
the northeast exit of this building.

39:00.400 --> 39:03.040
Four on the ground, a sniper
on the rooftop next door.

39:03.160 --> 39:05.000
I'm assuming they're
operating as a single unit.

39:05.080 --> 39:08.880
I want you to give them a Code 9,
send them to the front entrance now.

39:09.040 --> 39:12.960
Jack Bauer's running the operation.
I don't have the authority to do that.

39:13.080 --> 39:17.680
No authority? Really?

39:17.760 --> 39:20.080
- "Kevin, is Michelle still conscious?"
- Yes.

39:20.160 --> 39:23.120
Take an eye out.

39:23.240 --> 39:25.520
No! Wait, stop!

39:25.600 --> 39:27.480
Kevin, hold for a second.

39:34.320 --> 39:38.800
- It's gonna take me some time.
- You have 30 seconds.

39:50.040 --> 39:53.520
Jerry, we're talking about mass hysteria
spreading all over the place.

39:53.640 --> 39:56.720
- Now we're not in any position to mobilize...
- "It doesn't matter."

39:56.840 --> 39:59.440
Our position is to let
the public know what is going on.

40:08.600 --> 40:11.920
- This is Baker.
- This is Tony Almeida. Switch to channel three.

40:12.080 --> 40:14.560
Go ahead.

40:14.680 --> 40:17.040
We need you to Code 9 your team.

40:17.160 --> 40:19.040
I want you to use a controlled channel
in case Saunders is listening.

40:19.120 --> 40:21.600
- What are we doing?
- Move everyone to the front now.

40:21.720 --> 40:24.400
I've been monitoring all channels.
There's nothing going on in the front.

40:24.520 --> 40:27.560
We just got a new sat feed
that Jack doesn't have yet.

40:27.680 --> 40:29.680
Looks like Saunders is
on the move in a blind spot.

40:29.840 --> 40:31.640
Roger that. Four C.T.U. Personnel
diverting to new mark.

40:31.760 --> 40:34.520
No, Baker. Negative. Not just
C.T.U. Personnel, everyone.

40:34.640 --> 40:36.640
Police control included.
Get there now!

40:36.760 --> 40:38.960
Team 4, we have a Code 9.
Repeat, Code 9.

40:39.040 --> 40:41.480
Everyone to the front of the building now!
Move to the front of the building.

40:41.600 --> 40:44.680
Down! Down!

40:45.305 --> 40:51.290
