WEBVTT

00:13.430 --> 00:15.181
Will you open
another bottle of wine?

00:15.765 --> 00:18.518
-You want wine?
-Yeah. Are you judging me?

00:18.601 --> 00:20.854
Wine makes me tired.
Doesn't make you tired?

00:20.937 --> 00:23.314
Wine does it for me. It's an aphrodisiac.

00:23.398 --> 00:25.150
-I'll have wine.
-Let's have some wine.

00:25.233 --> 00:27.235
Wine. I need one for the--
Where's the wine?

00:28.903 --> 00:30.321
Wine? Wine not?

00:30.405 --> 00:31.823
Wine not?

00:31.906 --> 00:34.117
So I think Cody could sense

00:34.200 --> 00:38.204
that the coming-out party
was a little… not my vibe.

00:38.705 --> 00:43.376
So we're gonna have a chill night tonight,
make some dinner, hang out, and relax.

00:44.753 --> 00:46.337
-That's new.
-Yeah.

00:46.421 --> 00:48.089
-I love it. It's cool.
-Thank you.

00:48.173 --> 00:50.008
It's Buffy the Vampire Slayer themed.

00:50.091 --> 00:50.967
What's that?

00:51.051 --> 00:55.096
My football laces.
And "God's got me." Jeremiah11.

00:55.180 --> 00:57.015
These two I'm in the process
of getting removed.

00:57.098 --> 00:58.808
You'll keep the cross?

00:58.892 --> 01:01.561
I'll keep the cross.
Keeping11, keeping "God's got me,"

01:01.644 --> 01:03.271
keeping the laces and the line.

01:03.855 --> 01:04.689
-Good for you.
-Yeah.

01:04.773 --> 01:07.525
I'm still trying to shed
different parts of me

01:07.609 --> 01:09.611
that might not be true to who I am,

01:09.694 --> 01:11.946
but one thing I'm not willing to give up

01:12.030 --> 01:14.824
and one thing
I'm not willing to sacrifice is my faith.

01:14.908 --> 01:17.535
I grew up in a Catholic church.

01:17.619 --> 01:20.080
I went to a Catholic grade school.

01:20.163 --> 01:22.040
I served as an altar boy.

01:22.123 --> 01:25.585
I attended mass
sometimes five days a week.

01:25.668 --> 01:30.215
I just remember God being at the forefront
of my childhood and of my life.

01:31.925 --> 01:34.344
You ready? You want some music?
Some country music?

01:34.427 --> 01:36.763
-Yes?
-Cody Belew! Cody Belew!

01:36.846 --> 01:38.181
-What's up?
-Hey!

01:38.264 --> 01:40.975
-I put on my show wig just for y'all.

01:41.601 --> 01:44.354
So, um, Cody's a good friend,
and what I love about Cody

01:44.437 --> 01:49.067
is he is one of our few out and proud
gay musicians, as well, in Nashville.

01:49.150 --> 01:51.861
-Sweet.
-That's why I wanted him here tonight.

01:51.945 --> 01:54.280
-Can we go to the roof? Let's go hang.
-Totally.

01:54.864 --> 01:57.617
-Come on, buddy.
-What's left on your journey?

01:57.700 --> 02:00.495
I think that's
what I'm trying to figure out and process.

02:00.578 --> 02:03.248
Like, I want to be a man of faith.

02:03.331 --> 02:06.626
Like, my relationship with God…
Sorry, I'm getting emotional.

02:06.709 --> 02:09.462
-Don't cry.
-Uh, my relationship with God…

02:09.963 --> 02:12.340
I guess, that's part
of what I'm struggling with.

02:12.423 --> 02:15.260
The Christian community
can be super judgmental,

02:15.343 --> 02:18.012
and I just would love
to have their support in this,

02:18.096 --> 02:20.181
and I just don't know how to handle it.

02:20.932 --> 02:23.268
-I know exactly what you're talking about.
-Yeah.

02:23.351 --> 02:25.478
I was raised
in the Southern Baptist tradition,

02:25.562 --> 02:28.690
and when I wanted to start coming out
to my friends in college,

02:28.773 --> 02:32.527
these two girls
that I was so close to, I told them.

02:32.610 --> 02:35.738
-They instantly just broke into sobs.
-Yeah.

02:35.822 --> 02:37.031
We all had to hold--

02:37.115 --> 02:40.326
Three of us in this car,
so that they could pray it out of me.

02:40.410 --> 02:43.288
-Yeah.
-There's this switch that happens.

02:43.371 --> 02:48.209
Like I'm not anointed anymore
because God now has a problem with me.

02:48.293 --> 02:53.840
And I've learned that a lot of the people
I've loved my whole life feel that way.

02:53.923 --> 02:55.592
They don't want their mind changed.

02:55.675 --> 02:58.011
The church I go to,
the friend group I have,

02:58.094 --> 03:01.598
really helped me get through
one of the darkest moments of my life,

03:01.681 --> 03:04.851
and knowing that I can lose them now,
that would be difficult.

03:05.351 --> 03:07.812
There's a whole gamut of being gay, right?

03:07.896 --> 03:11.983
Like, you can be
a very buttoned-up Christian gay,

03:12.066 --> 03:14.652
or you can be a Gus gay.

03:15.236 --> 03:18.239
-A slut is what that is.

03:18.323 --> 03:19.449
A big old slut.

03:20.575 --> 03:23.077
So this song is called "Crimes."

03:23.161 --> 03:26.623
It's just my perspective on the trauma
that we all grow up with, right?

03:26.706 --> 03:29.626
Have you been called "faggot"
from a moving car?

03:29.709 --> 03:30.543
For sure.

03:30.627 --> 03:32.378
I wasn't even having a gay moment.

03:32.462 --> 03:34.714
I mean, this car slammed on its brakes,

03:34.797 --> 03:37.467
and I was walking across a crosswalk,

03:37.550 --> 03:40.261
and this car full of dudes just yelled it.

03:40.887 --> 03:42.305
And they threw a bottle.

03:42.388 --> 03:45.433
And that's when I kind of knew
what I was dealing with.

03:45.516 --> 03:48.186
So I just…
This is the first song I ever wrote

03:49.187 --> 03:53.107
about myself that I was honest in.

04:44.826 --> 04:47.829
Every word of that song
hit me like a ton of bricks.

04:47.912 --> 04:49.789
With Catholic and Christian religion,

04:49.872 --> 04:52.333
homosexuality is a sin, and, um…

04:54.627 --> 04:56.879
I remember the first time
I watched gay porn,

04:56.963 --> 04:59.590
I, like, dropped to my knees
and prayed immediately,

04:59.674 --> 05:02.135
and I was like,
"Don't ever let me do that again."

05:02.218 --> 05:05.263
Like, "Don't, like…
Don't let me get away with this."

05:06.139 --> 05:08.808
There was a lot of moments like that,
and a lot of prayers went up,

05:08.891 --> 05:10.560
and a lot of confusion happened.

05:10.643 --> 05:13.396
I feared that I was gonna let God down.

05:26.242 --> 05:27.744
Oh my gosh.

05:27.827 --> 05:29.329
-Holy shit.
-That was so good.

05:29.412 --> 05:31.831
I'm glad
you got to that third verse, though.

05:31.914 --> 05:33.041
That was so good.

05:33.124 --> 05:35.835
You have to put it
on the plight of the oppressor, right?

05:35.918 --> 05:37.420
"Stack your crimes against mine."

05:37.503 --> 05:41.424
The people that wanna have an opinion
live in a glass house, so…

05:41.507 --> 05:43.384
Music has always been my therapy,

05:43.968 --> 05:47.930
and, like, that song, I was like,
"Shit. He's calling me out right now."

05:48.014 --> 05:50.141
I was calling myself out
when I wrote it,

05:50.224 --> 05:52.977
and after I sort of reconciled all that

05:53.061 --> 05:56.481
is when the opportunities I've had
started coming my way.

05:57.440 --> 06:00.568
And, um, now I'm sitting here
drinking out of dicks with y'all.

06:00.651 --> 06:01.486
It's just like…

06:01.569 --> 06:04.489
Like, "I'm talking to God,
but I'm drinking out of a cock straw."

06:04.572 --> 06:06.657
A song in the making.
We're workshopping it.

06:08.868 --> 06:09.702
Come on now!

06:35.728 --> 06:38.648
-How you doing?
-Good. What's up, dude?

06:38.731 --> 06:40.400
-How are you?
-Good. Good to see you.

06:40.483 --> 06:41.984
-Good to see y'all.
-What's up?

06:42.068 --> 06:43.611
What up? Glad you could make it.

06:43.694 --> 06:44.904
-How you been, man?
-Good.

06:44.987 --> 06:47.490
-Barely made it.
-You go to church this morning?

06:48.116 --> 06:50.618
Well, wifey's in Nashville.

06:50.701 --> 06:53.246
-So? Oh, you're on full-on dad duty.
-Full-on dad duty.

06:53.329 --> 06:54.163
Yeah.

06:54.247 --> 06:56.833
For me, God works through situations.

06:56.916 --> 06:58.167
God gives me signs.

06:58.251 --> 07:02.839
God puts people and signals
in my life to help me.

07:05.550 --> 07:07.135
-Come on!
-Rock it.

07:07.927 --> 07:11.973
If I do come out to my friends,
are they still going to love me?

07:12.056 --> 07:15.226
Are they still going to be there for me
as Christian men?

07:15.810 --> 07:19.939
That is scary for me right now
because I can't lose them as friends.

07:20.022 --> 07:21.149
I think it would crush me,

07:21.232 --> 07:23.484
because I've been through
so much with them,

07:23.568 --> 07:24.569
and they're my people.

07:24.652 --> 07:25.611
This is my circle.

07:25.695 --> 07:29.073
This is who I run with,
and I need them in my life.

07:29.157 --> 07:30.366
I did wanna, like…

07:30.450 --> 07:33.494
I've been putting off a conversation
I wanted to have with you guys.

07:33.578 --> 07:34.954
-Yeah, what's that?
-Um…

07:35.496 --> 07:37.832
It was scary moving back here from LA,

07:37.915 --> 07:40.293
'cause I didn't know
if I'd have my friend group.

07:40.376 --> 07:43.296
-I knew I had my family here. And I also…
-Sure.

07:43.379 --> 07:45.798
That's why we reached out,
so you'd know you're a bro.

07:45.882 --> 07:47.467
Not just a friend, you're like a brother.

07:47.550 --> 07:49.552
-Yeah.
-So we care about you.

07:49.635 --> 07:51.220
No, I appreciate that.

07:51.304 --> 07:52.722
My faith is important to me,

07:52.805 --> 07:56.058
and it's been a tricky, uh, situation
to sort of navigate.

07:57.101 --> 07:59.812
Honestly, I sort of
wanna, like, talk to you guys.

08:01.063 --> 08:02.398
I, uh…

08:02.899 --> 08:05.109
I also came out as gay
to my parents this year.

08:05.193 --> 08:06.068
You did?

08:08.988 --> 08:13.242
And it's been hard, and…
You two, and Chad specifically, like,

08:13.326 --> 08:16.746
you guys are… you guys are all men of God,
and you've helped me.

08:16.829 --> 08:20.249
I think something that's sort of been
eye-opening for me as of late is

08:20.333 --> 08:23.211
everybody always says,
"When did you give your life to Jesus?"

08:23.294 --> 08:24.295
And, for me,

08:25.296 --> 08:29.383
it was when I stopped asking
and praying to him to take the gay away.

08:32.470 --> 08:37.642
The church talks about sexual immorality
and other ways that people sin,

08:37.725 --> 08:40.269
and at the end of every service,
you are loved.

08:40.353 --> 08:42.313
Like, "You're loved,
and we're all sinners,"

08:42.396 --> 08:45.691
and I was like, "I wanna figure out
what does that mean?" You know?

08:45.775 --> 08:50.112
I think if you start there, like,
Jesus loves you no matter what,

08:50.196 --> 08:51.572
-we all do.
-Yep.

08:51.656 --> 08:54.992
And if we're trying to be like Jesus,
bro, we love you.

08:55.076 --> 08:57.703
It doesn't matter.
Whether we agree with that or not.

08:58.496 --> 09:01.958
It's like, we don't see eye to eye
on that necessarily, right?

09:02.041 --> 09:03.751
But I love you like a brother.

09:04.794 --> 09:06.546
Every single one of us
are sinners.

09:06.629 --> 09:09.590
But, see, when you say,
"See eye to eye," or…

09:09.674 --> 09:12.927
I know the term "we're all sinners,"
and I'm trying to figure out…

09:13.010 --> 09:16.472
I just don't want me being me to be a sin.

09:17.181 --> 09:20.184
That's a tough one. I'd be curious
to see what pastor had to say…

09:20.268 --> 09:22.395
-Yeah.
-…first, and kind of go off that, but…

09:22.478 --> 09:25.648
He's probably gonna know the Bible
better than all of us, so…

09:25.731 --> 09:26.566
Yeah.

09:26.649 --> 09:28.734
-There's a lot to that book.
-Yeah.

09:29.652 --> 09:33.698
I can still feel their love.
I can still feel their friendship.

09:33.781 --> 09:37.577
But I just feel like they're intimidated
or scared to actually take a stance.

09:38.160 --> 09:40.246
There's this constant
state of contradiction

09:40.329 --> 09:42.039
allowing people to be gay

09:42.623 --> 09:44.959
but also condemning them for it too.

09:45.668 --> 09:48.379
This conversation doesn't come up
'cause it's uncomfortable.

09:48.462 --> 09:50.881
And it's one
that a lot of Christians dance around.

09:50.965 --> 09:53.092
A lot of people try to figure out
what it means.

09:53.175 --> 09:56.178
I don't think anybody's ever answered it,
at least to my knowledge.

09:56.262 --> 09:59.724
I think we can continue
this conversation too, in the church.

09:59.807 --> 10:01.976
We'll figure out the… the Christ path.

10:02.059 --> 10:04.270
I mean,
it might be a lot for you to digest,

10:04.353 --> 10:07.398
and, like he said,
you might not see eye to eye.

10:08.149 --> 10:09.275
Probably won't.

10:09.358 --> 10:11.193
But, dude, we love you.

10:11.902 --> 10:13.821
I don't think any of that stops.

10:14.739 --> 10:15.656
From him or us.

10:16.240 --> 10:19.952
I'd start there, and then we can all
navigate and challenge each other.

10:22.246 --> 10:23.080
Good.

10:36.594 --> 10:38.137
Hey, how are you?

10:38.638 --> 10:41.766
-Hey, Colton, how are you?
-I'm doing well.

10:41.849 --> 10:45.519
There's been some personal things
that I've been going through, um,

10:46.103 --> 10:49.398
that have been challenging for me
to navigate in the way of faith,

10:49.482 --> 10:52.735
and sort of wanted to talk
and see if, you know, you can be there,

10:52.818 --> 10:57.031
or someone, um, from the church
can sort of help navigate this.

10:58.032 --> 11:00.743
Chad and Beau and Kev,
they don't have all the answers.

11:00.826 --> 11:03.788
But there is someone
who does speak for the church,

11:03.871 --> 11:05.331
and that is my pastor.

11:05.831 --> 11:08.459
It's a conversation
that I feel like has to happen,

11:08.542 --> 11:12.713
and I think that, for me, is what's scary,
and that, for me, is what's intimidating,

11:12.797 --> 11:14.924
because I don't wanna lose those friends,

11:15.007 --> 11:18.803
I don't wanna lose my church,
and I don't want to let anybody down.

11:19.303 --> 11:21.847
Can you give me a heads-up
on what you're going through?

11:21.931 --> 11:25.059
The biggest part of it is, um…

11:26.394 --> 11:29.939
I came out as gay
to my parents and to my family.

11:31.899 --> 11:35.444
And that's why this is
sort of a struggle for me right now.

11:35.528 --> 11:40.199
And so, you say you came out gay,
what does that mean for you?

11:41.158 --> 11:43.911
Coming out for me has meant
I don't hate myself anymore.

11:43.994 --> 11:48.416
I'm not praying the gay away
like I did for so many years.

11:48.499 --> 11:51.836
I distinctly remember thanking God
for making me the Bachelor.

11:51.919 --> 11:57.883
I distinctly remember, like, thanking him
for, like, getting me out of… being gay.

11:57.967 --> 11:59.719
Um, I thought that was my way out,

11:59.802 --> 12:02.263
and I think that was me
forcing myself to be straight.

12:02.346 --> 12:05.599
And I'm exploring, like,
what that means with my faith,

12:05.683 --> 12:07.643
and what that means
as me as a human being.

12:07.727 --> 12:10.479
But I don't know how to navigate it.
I don't know what to do.

12:11.522 --> 12:14.150
So, what would you like
to process with me?

12:14.233 --> 12:17.236
I just would like to have
a conversation with you about…

12:18.904 --> 12:22.324
Look, my friends saved my life.
My friends brought me into church.

12:23.325 --> 12:24.994
I've been there. Um…

12:25.661 --> 12:28.205
Your sermons are awesome.
I feel loved there.

12:28.289 --> 12:31.292
I feel accepted there,
but I don't know if that's the case.

12:31.876 --> 12:33.335
That's intimidating to me.

12:33.419 --> 12:37.131
And that's why I just wanted to have
a convo with you to figure out…

12:37.214 --> 12:39.800
So, what would you say
the cross has done in your life?

12:39.884 --> 12:43.763
What difference has it made
that Jesus died for your sins?

12:46.390 --> 12:50.352
I would say that, early on,
the cross to me was a guideline

12:50.436 --> 12:53.939
and boundaries that I could
and couldn't do, as a Catholic.

12:54.023 --> 12:58.402
And now, for me,
the cross is hope, the cross is love.

12:59.195 --> 13:02.865
The cross is a representation of…

13:04.241 --> 13:06.410
what, in my opinion,

13:06.494 --> 13:09.955
what we need more of in this world
right now, and that's love and peace.

13:10.039 --> 13:14.502
With everybody that comes in
with any kind of baggage,

13:14.585 --> 13:18.130
sin, trauma, hang-ups, hurts, whatever,

13:18.923 --> 13:21.342
I believe that the Bible
makes it very clear that

13:21.425 --> 13:24.720
Jesus was willing to lay down
his life on the cross for any one of us.

13:24.804 --> 13:26.597
But I've preached enough sermons to know

13:26.680 --> 13:28.933
I believe God made marriage
between man and woman.

13:29.016 --> 13:31.393
I think sexuality
is determined to be that way,

13:31.477 --> 13:34.688
and you and I can disagree on that,
and I can still love you.

13:34.772 --> 13:37.817
Doesn't change you coming
to church or anything.

13:37.900 --> 13:41.445
But I would just have a different opinion
than you about your story

13:41.529 --> 13:42.738
and where you're at.

13:44.657 --> 13:48.244
The challenge with what I would call
the sin of homosexuality is…

13:48.327 --> 13:52.832
There are so many things that are sinful.
If you're a drunk, if you're a gossip,

13:52.915 --> 13:54.959
whatever, you don't hear much about that.

13:55.042 --> 13:57.169
Homosexuality is really, really bad.

13:58.879 --> 14:01.173
I have a Bible verse
that means the world to me.

14:01.257 --> 14:03.717
It's Jeremiah11. Um…

14:03.801 --> 14:05.386
"For I know the plans I have for you,

14:05.469 --> 14:08.305
plans to prosper, not to harm you,
plans to give you hope and a future."

14:08.931 --> 14:10.349
It makes me feel accepted

14:10.432 --> 14:13.435
and makes me feel
like it is a pro-gay Bible verse. Um…

14:13.519 --> 14:15.521
Well, here's my only concern.

14:15.604 --> 14:19.316
I have not heard in our discussion
your conversion story to Christ,

14:19.400 --> 14:22.111
like, when Jesus really became
the Lord of your life,

14:22.194 --> 14:23.779
and when the Bible became real.

14:23.863 --> 14:28.158
All of a sudden, where you feel
like you really became a Christian

14:28.242 --> 14:32.705
is when you said, "You know what?
I am gay. I'm just going to be who I am."

14:32.788 --> 14:33.956
Blah, blah, blah.

14:34.039 --> 14:37.001
"And, by doing that, now I'm liberated."

14:37.084 --> 14:40.045
"Now I just ask God
to use my life like Proverbs11."

14:40.129 --> 14:41.338
-Yes.
-Okay.

14:41.422 --> 14:43.716
I'll be honest with you.
That's just not true.

14:43.799 --> 14:46.051
I think because you identify with it,

14:46.135 --> 14:48.262
everybody identifies
with their sin in some way,

14:48.345 --> 14:50.598
"It's just who I am,
it's who God made me…"

14:50.681 --> 14:52.766
What I'd love you to consider is this.

14:52.850 --> 14:55.436
We spend our whole lives
from the time we're born in sin.

14:55.519 --> 14:57.438
And then in church
there come some big ones

14:57.521 --> 15:00.232
like abortion or divorce or homosexuality.

15:00.316 --> 15:02.526
-Those three get pinned up on the wall.
-Yep.

15:02.610 --> 15:06.071
As long as you don't do those,
you can do anything else and it's good.

15:06.155 --> 15:08.824
Where you and I
would have a different world view

15:08.908 --> 15:11.327
would be on what God says about you,

15:11.410 --> 15:14.330
and even what you're saying
about who you truly are.

15:14.413 --> 15:17.416
I mean, I don't care
what we're talking about, like,

15:17.499 --> 15:19.793
I would say homosexuality is a sin

15:19.877 --> 15:23.213
because the Bible
makes it pretty clear that it is.

15:23.297 --> 15:24.757
I mean, Christ died for you,

15:24.840 --> 15:29.386
and he just wants to change everything
inside of you, not just… not just this.

15:29.470 --> 15:33.432
He wants to cleanse your heart
so that you never walk in fear again.

15:33.515 --> 15:34.683
All right. Can we pray?

15:34.767 --> 15:36.268
Of course. Yeah. For sure.

15:36.352 --> 15:38.896
Lord, bless my brother.
Bless Colton in every way.

15:38.979 --> 15:42.107
Encourage him to stay
and just be with him.

15:42.191 --> 15:43.317
In Jesus' name, amen.

15:43.400 --> 15:44.526
Amen.

15:44.610 --> 15:46.445
Thank you. All right. Bye-bye.

15:49.907 --> 15:51.867
I don't know what to do,
I don't know what to say,

15:51.951 --> 15:56.121
so I just…
sort of shrink a little bit and hide,

15:56.205 --> 16:00.000
and hearing him say what I'm doing
is a sin and what I'm doing is wrong,

16:00.084 --> 16:01.919
and it's just creating this doubt.

16:02.002 --> 16:05.422
It's creating this confusion internally
for me right now,

16:05.506 --> 16:09.176
to be like, "Okay, you know,
is this the devil working through me?"

16:11.095 --> 16:14.098
It was hard to hear.
And there's a lot of question marks

16:14.181 --> 16:16.308
that I'm gonna need answers to

16:17.434 --> 16:18.936
to… to figure this out.

16:29.238 --> 16:32.741
Gus, kombucha beer,
regular beer, uh, mint mojito?

16:33.993 --> 16:36.161
-I'll take a kombucha beer.
-Okay.

16:37.579 --> 16:40.040
So I had my talk with my pastor yesterday.

16:40.124 --> 16:41.208
Oh, right.

16:41.792 --> 16:43.919
-And--
-And? With the church out here?

16:44.003 --> 16:44.962
Yeah.

16:45.879 --> 16:47.840
He let me know
that he has different views,

16:47.923 --> 16:50.259
that he views being gay as a sin,

16:50.342 --> 16:51.760
and that there are scripture

16:51.844 --> 16:54.471
that flat-out says
marriage is between a man and a woman,

16:54.555 --> 16:57.349
and I guess that means
I can't get married in his church.

16:57.433 --> 16:59.518
I was like,
"So if I want to come over here,

16:59.601 --> 17:02.980
I can't bring my homosexuality with me,
because that's technically a sin--"

17:03.063 --> 17:05.065
So he told you
you can't be a Christian.

17:05.149 --> 17:07.276
He said you can be a Christian,
but you can't be gay,

17:07.359 --> 17:09.361
and you won't wanna be gay
'cause you're a Christian,

17:09.445 --> 17:11.905
but it's like, "No, actually,
this is an inherent part of me,

17:11.989 --> 17:13.449
this is something I was born with."

17:13.532 --> 17:16.660
But you can still give money, right?
Or do they give you money back?

17:16.744 --> 17:17.828
When you try to donate?

17:17.911 --> 17:18.746
I don't know.

17:18.829 --> 17:20.414
-Have you donated?
-Yeah.

17:21.040 --> 17:22.291
Did you get the money back?

17:22.374 --> 17:23.292
-No.
-Oh.

17:23.876 --> 17:25.002
That's interesting.

17:25.586 --> 17:27.629
How do you still
consider yourself a Christian

17:27.713 --> 17:31.467
even though the head of your church,
the people where you go to worship,

17:31.550 --> 17:33.343
told you you aren't a Christian?

17:33.427 --> 17:35.429
It's hard for me
to even figure out,

17:35.512 --> 17:38.265
because this is
the same church that I feel like

17:38.974 --> 17:41.769
did help me when I left LA,
and when I first got here,

17:41.852 --> 17:44.563
because it did bring me
a sense of community.

17:45.064 --> 17:47.858
I don't want to, like,
alienate this church.

17:47.941 --> 17:51.528
-I don't want to alienate my friends.
-But also this church is alienating you.

17:51.612 --> 17:54.448
You're not alienating them.
They're alienating you.

17:54.531 --> 17:57.242
That's right.
I'm not trying to just drill into you,

17:57.326 --> 18:00.037
but if you know, like,
"Okay, you can come to my church,

18:00.120 --> 18:02.581
but you're not really welcome,
you're not really accepted."

18:02.664 --> 18:06.001
"You're not really
getting to live your truth and embraced."

18:06.085 --> 18:08.045
"You can't get married in this church."

18:08.629 --> 18:11.548
Why… That's not like
a very conducive atmosphere

18:11.632 --> 18:14.176
for being comfortable
and being happy and having…

18:15.803 --> 18:19.014
I don't know, inner peace.
That just sounds like constant turmoil.

18:19.098 --> 18:20.682
Why would you ever wanna do that?

18:21.183 --> 18:23.769
It's not just me
trying to figure out my faith.

18:23.852 --> 18:26.563
I just wanna make sure
I don't lose my friendships too.

18:26.647 --> 18:27.898
But, also, I've been…

18:27.981 --> 18:31.026
29 years of people telling me
who I am and what I am.

18:31.110 --> 18:34.905
And the whole point of me coming out
is to be able to be myself now.

18:34.988 --> 18:37.866
You've said that you pinpointed
this moment in the locker room

18:37.950 --> 18:40.160
to you realizing
you'd have to closet yourself,

18:40.744 --> 18:43.705
but I think whether it was
subconscious or conscious,

18:43.789 --> 18:46.500
this is the reason
you started to closet yourself.

18:47.584 --> 18:50.712
You thought that who you were was sinful,

18:50.796 --> 18:54.216
was an abomination, was something
that couldn't be accepted or loved.

18:54.299 --> 18:55.926
Or you thought you were confused

18:56.009 --> 18:59.429
and that these were gay urges
or gay tendencies, but you weren't gay,

18:59.513 --> 19:02.224
and you had to grapple with that
and beat yourself up over it,

19:02.307 --> 19:04.852
and, honestly, struggled
because of those teachings.

19:04.935 --> 19:08.021
That's why I don't know why
you even want to be a part of this.

19:08.105 --> 19:10.566
I'm absolutely protective of Colton.
I mean, like…

19:10.649 --> 19:14.528
I think of him as a friend.
I think of him as a brother.

19:14.611 --> 19:16.530
He so desperately wanted this approval

19:16.613 --> 19:21.660
because he isn't quite confident enough
in himself to walk away without it.

19:21.743 --> 19:24.371
And when there's any moment of hesitation

19:24.454 --> 19:26.999
of whether or not
he is gonna be met with support,

19:27.082 --> 19:29.960
he reverts back
to this kind of, like, childhood state

19:30.043 --> 19:32.212
where he's just
so desperately seeking approval.

19:32.296 --> 19:34.173
So I'm frustrated 'cause it feels like

19:34.256 --> 19:36.884
it's backpedaling the progress we made
the past few weeks.

19:36.967 --> 19:40.512
I knew going into it, it was a gamble,

19:40.596 --> 19:42.890
and I probably knew
what the answer was gonna be,

19:42.973 --> 19:44.975
and I think that's why I never asked it.

19:45.058 --> 19:47.728
It's hard because I heard
the answers I didn't wanna hear,

19:47.811 --> 19:50.272
and part of me
still wants to stay part of this church.

19:50.355 --> 19:53.984
But you just tried
and offered yourself to them as you are,

19:54.067 --> 19:57.446
like, "This is me. This is who I am."
And they said no. So, like…

19:57.946 --> 20:01.033
I don't really see
what there is to consider at this point.

20:20.552 --> 20:21.595
Whew!

20:22.262 --> 20:24.181
I can't believe I have no signal.

20:24.264 --> 20:27.100
Yeah, so I went back
to my hometown in Illinois.

20:27.184 --> 20:28.560
Oh gosh. How was that?

20:28.644 --> 20:31.647
I talked to my high school coach,
which was a huge step.

20:31.730 --> 20:32.940
-Wow!
-And it was--

20:33.023 --> 20:34.274
That's pretty cool.

20:34.358 --> 20:39.529
I think the response from my church has
sort of left me at a low point this week

20:39.613 --> 20:41.448
in regards to my faith.

20:41.531 --> 20:44.952
It's just… It's a complicated situation,

20:45.035 --> 20:47.246
and I'm spiraling a little bit.

20:47.329 --> 20:49.456
So I reached out to Esera,

20:49.539 --> 20:55.462
because he is the first gay person
that is also a Christian that I've met,

20:55.545 --> 20:58.006
so I definitely
want to spend more time with him,

20:58.090 --> 21:01.134
talking through
what his faith journey has been like,

21:01.218 --> 21:03.553
as far as being a Christian and being gay.

21:04.137 --> 21:06.348
-How's your kids doing?
-They're doing really good.

21:06.431 --> 21:07.599
-Good.
-Really good.

21:10.602 --> 21:12.187
Yeah. I just have to ask.

21:12.271 --> 21:16.066
Do you wear that everywhere,
or you just trying to throw it in my face?

21:16.149 --> 21:18.277
It's the NFC championship ring.

21:18.360 --> 21:19.403
No… No big deal.

21:19.486 --> 21:21.905
No big deal.
It's the loser ring, right?

21:21.989 --> 21:24.324
Always the runner-up,
never the queen, right?

21:24.408 --> 21:26.994
So, um… But it's…
You know, it's something that, uh,

21:27.077 --> 21:32.582
I contributed to getting us there
and stuff, so it's all cool.

21:32.666 --> 21:34.334
-Good for you.
-Thank you, brother.

21:34.418 --> 21:35.460
Yeah.

21:35.544 --> 21:38.964
-What's going on, buddy?
-I had my call with my pastor, and--

21:39.047 --> 21:42.884
-How did that go?
-It didn't go great.

21:42.968 --> 21:45.637
It just wasn't the conversation
I was hoping for.

21:45.721 --> 21:47.931
-And that's sort of a big deal to me…
-Right.

21:48.015 --> 21:50.183
…and it sort of
makes me question things, and…

21:50.267 --> 21:51.560
Now I have to figure out,

21:51.643 --> 21:54.021
did my relationship with God change
since I came out.

21:54.646 --> 21:57.232
Have you talked
to your family about this, or…

21:57.316 --> 22:00.027
I've talked to, like, my brother and Gus.

22:00.110 --> 22:01.278
Oh gosh.

22:01.361 --> 22:03.030
And their immediate reaction was,

22:03.113 --> 22:05.157
"Why would you wanna
be a part of something

22:05.240 --> 22:08.910
-that says you're wrong and you're a sin?"
-Right.

22:08.994 --> 22:12.080
And, I mean, I can't lie to you,

22:12.164 --> 22:14.166
when they said that,
it's like, "Why do I?"

22:14.249 --> 22:17.961
And even my friends in Colorado,
you know, they go to church, obviously,

22:18.045 --> 22:20.797
and we attend Bible study
and talk scripture together,

22:20.881 --> 22:23.342
and I think
even they are confused right now.

22:23.425 --> 22:26.636
My faith is super important to me,
and I know I want it to be there.

22:26.720 --> 22:29.056
I just don't know
in what capacity right now.

22:29.139 --> 22:32.434
I think for me too,
there's this moment I realized, you know,

22:32.517 --> 22:34.311
I wasn't doing well mentally.

22:35.103 --> 22:38.857
Hit, like, this depression,
anxiety, and medicating myself.

22:38.940 --> 22:39.816
Right.

22:39.900 --> 22:43.653
And then, eventually,
taking too much, trying to kill myself.

22:43.737 --> 22:46.823
I went to sleep not expecting to wake up,
and He woke me up.

22:46.907 --> 22:49.117
-Right.
-You know? And I truly believe that.

22:50.911 --> 22:53.747
It's moments like that
and it's those self-realizations

22:53.830 --> 22:56.291
that want me to stay
attached to my faith so much,

22:56.375 --> 22:57.793
because I shouldn't be here.

22:58.377 --> 23:00.629
I'm getting a little bit emotional
about this one.

23:00.712 --> 23:04.007
I don't wanna cry, right,
'cause I'm not a crybaby, but…

23:04.091 --> 23:05.842
-No, it's just…
-It's okay.

23:05.926 --> 23:08.470
It just hurts sometimes, right? It hurts…

23:13.517 --> 23:17.312
Tell you what, when I came out,
when I was in the same situation as you,

23:17.979 --> 23:20.482
um, I struggled a lot with that

23:20.565 --> 23:24.611
because of my faith
and because of who I truly was, right?

23:24.694 --> 23:27.489
Inside. And, uh, the LGBTQ community,

23:27.572 --> 23:29.783
we're raised in some form
of religion, right?

23:29.866 --> 23:31.201
But then when we come out,

23:31.284 --> 23:34.037
and I'm sure you're going through
this whole thing as well,

23:34.121 --> 23:36.415
people tell us that God hates us, right?

23:36.498 --> 23:39.209
-Who gave you that authority, right?
-Yeah.

23:39.292 --> 23:41.169
Who gives you the authority on Earth

23:41.253 --> 23:43.839
to tell me and stuff
what I can or cannot do, right?

23:43.922 --> 23:47.175
And, I mean, it's one…
And then put God… put God in front of it.

23:47.259 --> 23:48.260
-Right?
-Yeah.

23:48.343 --> 23:52.013
Then they throw the whole Bible
at us and stuff like that, right? I mean…

23:53.181 --> 23:57.102
Before 1946, the word "homosexuality"
wasn't in the Bible, right?

23:57.185 --> 23:59.896
If you really wanna sorta kinda…
We don't have all day,

23:59.980 --> 24:02.482
but if you really wanna
dive into the Bible and stuff,

24:02.566 --> 24:05.777
then let's dive into the Bible,
because so many things have been changed.

24:05.861 --> 24:06.695
Yeah.

24:06.778 --> 24:10.198
For me, I think, and I told you before,
you gotta follow your heart.

24:10.866 --> 24:12.993
This thing right here.
That's what you have to follow.

24:13.952 --> 24:16.246
That's what I hold onto, right?
And that's what I…

24:16.329 --> 24:18.623
I don't hold on to the things that,
you know, the flesh…

24:18.707 --> 24:19.791
People tell me and stuff.

24:19.875 --> 24:22.169
When people would, like, condemn me,

24:22.252 --> 24:26.673
tell me it's a sin and all of that,
is the closer that I… I went to God.

24:28.091 --> 24:31.428
I think you need to figure out
what's more important to you, right?

24:31.511 --> 24:34.598
Your relationship with people
or your relationship with God?

24:35.640 --> 24:37.893
I know you've gone
through a lot, you know?

24:37.976 --> 24:43.273
And, um, it's important that you recognize
that there was God there

24:43.356 --> 24:45.984
when you felt like doing something
that just sort of…

24:46.067 --> 24:48.445
-Pulled you back. Yeah.
-…pulled you back. Right?

24:48.528 --> 24:50.572
Take your hat off, all right?

24:50.655 --> 24:51.698
Anyway.

24:51.781 --> 24:54.618
Heavenly Father, Lord,
I just pray for clarity on Colton.

24:54.701 --> 24:57.496
I pray, Father God,
that you would just continue to work

24:57.579 --> 24:59.998
in his life
and everything that he's doing right now.

25:00.081 --> 25:02.501
Lord, I pray, Father God,
give him guidance, Lord.

25:02.584 --> 25:05.462
And just let him know
that you're there for him, no matter what.

25:05.545 --> 25:06.463
We love you so much.

25:06.546 --> 25:09.716
We thank you for this beautiful day.
We thank you, Father God, for this hike,

25:09.799 --> 25:13.303
and we just ask, Lord, that you would
continue to bless our families

25:13.386 --> 25:15.138
and our friends in Jesus' name. Amen.

25:15.222 --> 25:16.056
Amen.

25:16.139 --> 25:17.182
-Cool.
-Thank you.

25:17.265 --> 25:18.475
Let's get on the hike.

25:24.564 --> 25:25.482
Whew!

25:31.530 --> 25:33.990
-Do I have to knock or anything?
-You just go in.

25:34.074 --> 25:36.701
-I've never been in one of these places.
-Thank you.

25:36.785 --> 25:40.830
Esera helped me find a church
that was LGBTQ+ friendly.

25:40.914 --> 25:42.123
Welcome, friends.

25:42.207 --> 25:44.834
-Why don't we all take a seat?
-Thank you for having us.

25:44.918 --> 25:47.671
I definitely think
this is a good step in the right direction

25:47.754 --> 25:52.342
to explore my relationship with God
and what that means to me.

25:52.425 --> 25:53.552
It's a good start.

25:53.635 --> 25:59.057
The organization of the MCC was started
over 50 years ago by a group of gay men,

25:59.140 --> 26:01.184
and if you'll notice, our backdrop,

26:01.268 --> 26:03.687
this beautiful stained-glass window
that you see,

26:03.770 --> 26:07.774
the body of Christ, he has different
skin tones and different body sizes,

26:07.857 --> 26:10.610
and the reason for that
is that we can come together,

26:10.694 --> 26:14.322
that we can be different,
that we can ask unusual questions.

26:14.406 --> 26:18.034
Everyone in this room, I think,
is involved in some kind of justice work.

26:18.118 --> 26:22.497
Manuel is Colorado's Foster Parent
of the Year this year,

26:22.581 --> 26:24.291
Heather and Zach are working

26:24.374 --> 26:28.128
in the nexus of making
mental healthcare more affordable.

26:28.211 --> 26:32.090
Colton and Gus, of course,
are trying to be Instagram thirst traps.

26:32.173 --> 26:33.425
-So…

26:35.468 --> 26:36.678
Oh my God.

26:36.761 --> 26:38.346
-Drag me to hell.

26:39.306 --> 26:43.226
Um… But the point is,
I think this is definitely a calling,

26:43.310 --> 26:45.979
and we're gonna go around,
to settle in with each other.

26:46.062 --> 26:48.565
I'm Manuel.
I grew up in foster care.

26:48.648 --> 26:51.234
The church people
were the only people ever there for me.

26:51.818 --> 26:55.155
And I was about ready
to lose the only family I ever had.

26:55.238 --> 26:57.657
And so I was like,

26:57.741 --> 27:00.619
"Am I gonna live my life for me
or for something else?"

27:00.702 --> 27:04.831
I'm George. Uh, I think
for a lot of Black people, we…

27:04.914 --> 27:06.374
Our faith gets us through,

27:06.458 --> 27:07.417
got us through,

27:07.500 --> 27:13.381
and so I really require
a lot of my faith of me, um,

27:13.465 --> 27:17.886
in terms of changing the world
and how are you in the world.

27:17.969 --> 27:21.473
And I ask that my church
think about those things too.

27:22.057 --> 27:23.433
My name is Heather Lundy.

27:23.516 --> 27:26.770
My grandfather is famous
in the Evangelical Christian space,

27:26.853 --> 27:29.272
and so my coming out process

27:29.356 --> 27:33.568
was part of navigating both
that religious and family identity as one.

27:33.652 --> 27:34.986
I'm also ordained.

27:35.070 --> 27:40.450
Uh, and so that's been a part
of my own process of coming out.

27:40.533 --> 27:43.620
Wow. That actually is crazy.
That must have been so hard.

27:43.703 --> 27:45.580
-Yeah.
-Oh my God. That…

27:46.623 --> 27:48.708
-Guess you're not supposed to say that.

27:48.792 --> 27:50.502
-It's okay.

27:50.585 --> 27:52.671
This is a safe space.
Be whoever you are, hon.

27:52.754 --> 27:54.756
I can only imagine
that would have been really hard.

27:54.839 --> 27:55.674
Mm-hmm.

27:56.299 --> 27:57.801
-Wow.
-Yeah. Yeah.

27:57.884 --> 28:00.595
Um, so I went through
sort of a dark patch,

28:00.679 --> 28:03.431
and it led me back here
to move back to Denver.

28:03.515 --> 28:04.891
I have a great group of friends,

28:04.974 --> 28:09.521
and, you know, one thing that we bond over
is our love for Jesus,

28:09.604 --> 28:12.941
and it gave me more structure with faith,

28:13.024 --> 28:15.151
which I don't know
exactly how I feel about it.

28:15.235 --> 28:16.403
It holds me accountable,

28:16.486 --> 28:19.781
but it's the same structure
that drove me out of the Catholic church.

28:19.864 --> 28:23.368
So it's been, like,
a constant battle for me, but…

28:24.035 --> 28:25.412
That's a bit of my story.

28:25.495 --> 28:27.664
But also, to add to it, he just came out

28:27.747 --> 28:31.084
and had a talk
with his priest at his old church

28:31.167 --> 28:33.962
and was not told that he wasn't accepted,

28:34.045 --> 28:36.840
but was basically told
that this is something

28:36.923 --> 28:39.217
that he was gonna grow out of,
and the closer he got to God,

28:39.300 --> 28:43.263
the further he would distance himself
from his homosexual tendencies.

28:43.346 --> 28:45.223
So they quoted Romans at you?

28:45.724 --> 28:48.309
-We broke down the Romans verse.

28:48.393 --> 28:49.310
Familiar tune.

28:49.394 --> 28:53.273
Romans 6 gets batted around
by my… my "peers and colleagues."

28:53.356 --> 28:57.569
Romans 6 is the verse that says,
you know, "The wages of sin is death."

28:57.652 --> 28:59.529
If you go back to the Old Testament,

28:59.612 --> 29:02.323
"And then at the very end,
at Easter morning,

29:02.407 --> 29:04.284
Jesus says, 'It is finished,'"

29:04.367 --> 29:07.829
which is actually better translated,
"It is paid in full."

29:07.912 --> 29:12.125
So if you think
about the wages of sin being paid in full,

29:12.208 --> 29:14.961
God… Christ has taken care
of those for us.

29:15.044 --> 29:18.757
And so my belief
is that sin no longer exists, period,

29:18.840 --> 29:20.633
and that we have overcome sin,

29:20.717 --> 29:24.262
that we have been given
this grace of forgiveness,

29:24.345 --> 29:27.807
and now it is our responsibility
to live into that grace.

29:27.891 --> 29:31.227
And instead of trying
to live for redemption,

29:31.311 --> 29:33.938
we have to live because we are redeemed.

29:34.022 --> 29:36.065
And so that's why most of us are here,

29:36.149 --> 29:41.154
most of us operate in the world
as a radiation of already being redeemed

29:41.237 --> 29:44.157
and not having to prove to any pastor,

29:44.240 --> 29:45.825
to any group of people,

29:45.909 --> 29:48.578
um, who we are and what our value is.

29:48.661 --> 29:51.331
That was one question
with my other pastor.

29:51.414 --> 29:52.665
I said, "Am I a sin?"

29:53.166 --> 29:56.419
Like, is the makings of me
as a human being a sin?

29:56.503 --> 29:58.880
'Cause I… I do believe
this is not a choice.

29:58.963 --> 30:02.550
I followed it up with, "You believe
Jesus Christ doesn't make mistakes."

30:02.634 --> 30:05.261
"And I'm sitting here telling you
I was made this way."

30:05.345 --> 30:10.266
Like, "I've known since I was young.
I was literally wired and born into this."

30:10.350 --> 30:11.643
And I obviously respect him

30:11.726 --> 30:15.563
and his studies
and what he brings to the table,

30:15.647 --> 30:18.191
and it's the reason why I'm sorta
having a hard time right now

30:18.274 --> 30:19.818
trying to figure all of this out,

30:19.901 --> 30:22.487
is because I do have,
still, a place in my heart

30:22.570 --> 30:24.823
that I, like, love
and appreciate about that.

30:24.906 --> 30:26.241
I have faith in my friends.

30:26.324 --> 30:27.575
-I really do.
-Good.

30:27.659 --> 30:30.703
You know, we did bond and meet
and form our friendship

30:31.412 --> 30:36.501
with faith being at the front of it,
so that has me a little insecure.

30:36.584 --> 30:42.173
These beautiful friendships
that I don't, um, want you to lose,

30:42.257 --> 30:44.926
I also hear you
putting conditions back on yourself.

30:45.927 --> 30:48.721
You need to let go of some of that

30:48.805 --> 30:51.015
and let people be hurt,

30:52.058 --> 30:53.935
let them be who they're gonna be.

30:54.018 --> 30:56.187
I want you to walk away from today

30:56.271 --> 30:59.023
feeling that you're released
from the conditions.

30:59.107 --> 31:00.066
And that doesn't…

31:00.149 --> 31:02.861
That insecurity doesn't go away
for a really long time.

31:02.944 --> 31:07.615
There's still the element of when
you've been brought up under the midst of,

31:07.699 --> 31:10.243
"You're gonna lose people
if you admit this."

31:10.326 --> 31:11.995
That fear is always there,

31:12.078 --> 31:15.790
and we have a really wonderful opportunity
to let people prove us wrong.

31:15.874 --> 31:16.749
Yeah.

31:16.833 --> 31:19.252
Colton, for your sake,

31:20.420 --> 31:25.174
I just want you to hear that you are loved
and you are accepted, fully,

31:25.675 --> 31:29.304
regardless of who you are,
how you are, and what you want.

31:29.387 --> 31:31.764
I feel like at the beginning
of this week I was asked

31:31.848 --> 31:35.101
to leave part of myself behind
to stay close to God.

31:35.935 --> 31:40.023
So this is definitely a good thing
for me to see and experience.

31:41.983 --> 31:43.985
-This was lovely.

31:44.068 --> 31:46.321
He was a little nervous coming into here.

31:46.404 --> 31:48.865
He was like, "I don't know
what this is gonna be like."

31:48.948 --> 31:51.576
-You know?

31:51.659 --> 31:54.829
He said, "I'm gonna catch on fire
when I walk in there."

31:54.913 --> 31:57.790
Had I spontaneously combusted,
I would have been like…

31:59.292 --> 32:01.377
-This was awesome.
-Mm-hmm.

32:01.461 --> 32:04.964
-Thank you again for that.
-Thank you. Thanks.

32:05.048 --> 32:06.716
I appreciate it. Thank you.

32:21.272 --> 32:22.523
Come here.

32:22.607 --> 32:24.943
I definitely feel like
this week has been a lot,

32:25.026 --> 32:27.445
and at times
I've definitely been feeling down,

32:27.946 --> 32:30.990
but I think I finally realized that…

32:33.868 --> 32:37.789
my relationship with God
didn't have to be in the church.

32:38.331 --> 32:41.709
My relationship with God
is between him and I.

32:41.793 --> 32:44.337
My faith with God is between him and I.

32:45.254 --> 32:49.550
And that's when my relationship with God
became stronger than ever.

32:54.138 --> 32:56.557
You have to live your life,

32:58.184 --> 33:02.563
and I guess anybody that is wondering,
can you be gay and can you be Christian?

33:02.647 --> 33:03.815
The answer is yes.

33:03.898 --> 33:06.943
You can be… Honestly, you can be
whatever you wanna be,

33:07.026 --> 33:09.278
and God's still gonna love you.

33:09.821 --> 33:12.031
And I think that's
what I've come to realize,

33:12.115 --> 33:15.243
is my relationship with God
is my relationship with God.

33:15.326 --> 33:19.831
And He created me and He made me
to be exactly who I am right here today,

33:19.914 --> 33:23.042
and He knew
that this was all gonna happen.

33:23.126 --> 33:24.544
He's working through me,

33:25.336 --> 33:28.006
and… I genuinely believe

33:28.089 --> 33:31.634
that… I am on my right path now.
