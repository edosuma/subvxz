00:00.485 --> 00:03.186
(Birds chirp)

00:03.188 --> 00:05.855
- Good Morning!
- Hi, Twyla.

00:05.857 --> 00:08.858
- I hear congratulations
are in order, Mrs. Rose.

00:08.860 --> 00:11.294
- Thank you, dear, for what?

00:11.296 --> 00:13.263
- Oh, should I not say
anything yet?

00:13.265 --> 00:15.598
- Well, you could say something,
think of it as a clue.

00:15.600 --> 00:17.367
- Not say something about what?

00:17.369 --> 00:19.602
- Your wife's big announcement.

00:19.604 --> 00:22.038
- Again dear, clue!

00:22.040 --> 00:24.540
- You running for town council!
- What, excuse me?

00:24.542 --> 00:26.409
- You're running for
town council?

00:26.411 --> 00:28.411
- No, I'm not running
for town council.

00:28.413 --> 00:31.180
- Oh, I must've misheard.

00:31.182 --> 00:32.949
Everyone was talking about
you standing up to council

00:32.951 --> 00:35.585
last week, so I just assumed--

00:35.587 --> 00:38.521
- Never assume, dear, It makes
an ass out of both of us.

00:38.523 --> 00:40.890
- It's not that absurd
an idea, Moira.

00:40.892 --> 00:43.393
You know, being on town council
might give you an outlet

00:43.395 --> 00:45.595
to channel all that...

00:45.597 --> 00:47.964
"passion" you have for this
town.

00:47.966 --> 00:50.333
- I'd sooner poke my eyes out
with hat pins.

00:50.335 --> 00:52.235
- Well, that's subtle.

00:52.237 --> 00:55.505
- Well, I think you would make
a great councilor.

00:55.507 --> 00:56.639
- Well, the right person
might be able to get

00:56.641 --> 00:59.175
a lot done around here.

00:59.177 --> 01:02.645
- The right person, John,
wouldn't be caught dead in this,

01:02.647 --> 01:05.815
they'd be running somewhere
a little more...

01:05.817 --> 01:08.318
- What?
- Moira...

01:08.320 --> 01:10.820
- Okay, maybe I should say
somewhere less...

01:10.822 --> 01:12.922
- Less what?
- What's the word I'm trying to think of?

01:12.924 --> 01:15.091
- Well, let's hope we don't
find it, okay?

01:15.093 --> 01:17.193
Are we ready to order,
councilor?

01:18.763 --> 01:20.630
- You go ahead.

01:20.632 --> 01:25.101
♪♪

01:28.206 --> 01:30.440
DAVID: Have you seen
my black shoe?

01:30.442 --> 01:32.375
It's a lace up,
probably lost in the sea

01:32.377 --> 01:34.210
of your dirty clothes?

01:34.212 --> 01:35.745
- No.
- Ugh!

01:37.582 --> 01:40.383
What is going on here?!

01:40.385 --> 01:42.952
Why are your clothes
crammed under my bed?

01:42.954 --> 01:45.655
- It's just temporary
storage, David.

01:47.592 --> 01:49.559
- Look at your things.

01:49.561 --> 01:51.461
Look at your life!

01:51.463 --> 01:53.563
- I have been distracted!

01:53.565 --> 01:56.366
- Why is this wet? Ewww!

01:56.368 --> 01:58.201
- Because I kicked over
a glass of water

01:58.203 --> 01:59.702
that you left on the floor.

01:59.704 --> 02:02.171
- I wasn't drinking water.

02:02.173 --> 02:04.574
- Okay, so maybe it was mine,
what difference does it make?

02:04.576 --> 02:06.309
Ugh!
- Oh my God!

02:06.311 --> 02:08.277
- Ugh! Anyway,
I need the room tonight,

02:08.279 --> 02:11.347
because I'm having a friend
over.

02:11.349 --> 02:13.316
- What friend?

02:13.318 --> 02:16.719
- Um Twyla, we're gonna have
a fun little sleepover.

02:16.721 --> 02:18.988
- Mhmm... You and Twyla?

02:18.990 --> 02:21.591
- Yeah, we're gonna do
face masks,

02:21.593 --> 02:23.192
and we're gonna talk about
boys that we both know,

02:23.194 --> 02:25.061
and have dated.

02:25.063 --> 02:27.463
- Um, have you spent
more than five minutes

02:27.465 --> 02:28.731
with the girl, one on one?

02:28.733 --> 02:31.501
She could be a serial killer.

02:31.503 --> 02:34.604
- Twy and I have tea together
like, every day, David.

02:34.606 --> 02:37.073
- That she serves you
at the cafe.

02:38.910 --> 02:42.111
- Because we're friends.

02:42.113 --> 02:45.081
- Oh... right.

02:45.083 --> 02:49.118
Um, so then where is Twyla
going to sleep tonight?

02:49.120 --> 02:51.521
- Because I'd say she could
stay under my bed,

02:51.523 --> 02:53.723
but your disgusting clothes
are all stuffed under there,

02:53.725 --> 02:56.592
So... just wondering,

02:56.594 --> 02:59.629
where she'd... sleep!

02:59.631 --> 03:01.898
- Stop doing that with your face!
- Hmm.

03:03.701 --> 03:05.201
(Dog barking)

03:10.175 --> 03:13.342
- Bob, now that Ray's
stepped down from council,

03:13.344 --> 03:16.212
I gather his seat
is up for grabs?

03:16.214 --> 03:18.714
- "His seat is up for grabs?"
(Chuckles)

03:18.716 --> 03:20.817
I could say something pretty
inappropriate right now.

03:20.819 --> 03:22.952
- Well, I'm hoping you don't.

03:22.954 --> 03:25.354
- No, but I could,
that's a real set up.

03:25.356 --> 03:27.857
- Yeah, yeah, but I was
thinking, if his seat--

03:27.859 --> 03:29.892
- There you go again!

03:29.894 --> 03:32.995
- could be filled by someone
with real experience...

03:32.997 --> 03:35.164
- Uh-huh.
- You see, I played a significant role

03:35.166 --> 03:37.433
in Gerald Caine's campaign.

03:37.435 --> 03:39.202
- Who's that?
- Well, he won a seat in the legislature,

03:39.204 --> 03:41.737
and now he's a senator.

03:41.739 --> 03:43.706
- Yeah well, town council
might be small potatoes

03:43.708 --> 03:45.107
for a guy like that.

03:45.109 --> 03:47.443
- Well, not him, Bob. Me!

03:47.445 --> 03:49.579
I'm talking about me.

03:49.581 --> 03:51.914
See, I've worked on a number
of campaigns,

03:51.916 --> 03:54.884
and I was president of the
Video Retailers Association.

03:54.886 --> 03:57.019
- Sure, and uh...

03:57.021 --> 03:59.455
it might be a nice change
of pace from banging your head

03:59.457 --> 04:00.923
against the wall here
every day.

04:00.925 --> 04:01.924
- Well, I'm not banging my head
against the wall,

04:01.926 --> 04:03.793
but if I were to run,

04:03.795 --> 04:06.162
I'd need support from people
like you.

04:06.164 --> 04:07.864
- Boy uh, so if you got this,

04:10.502 --> 04:13.236
that would mean we'd work
together here at the garage,

04:13.238 --> 04:15.605
and on council?

04:15.607 --> 04:17.940
If I didn't know any better,

04:17.942 --> 04:20.710
I might think you had
a crush on me! (Chuckles)

04:20.712 --> 04:22.712
- Well, that's--
that's funny.

04:22.714 --> 04:24.914
- I'm only teasing.
- Yeah, I know, I know.

04:24.916 --> 04:27.049
- I don't mean to embarrass you.

04:27.051 --> 04:30.353
- I'm not embarrassed!
- You have no reason to be embarrassed.

04:30.355 --> 04:32.321
You're a happily married man.
- Oh my.

04:32.323 --> 04:34.557
- And so am I!
- Okay, gotta go, Bob.

04:36.194 --> 04:37.660
(Music plays softly)

04:42.867 --> 04:45.768
- Hey Twy, come sit!

04:45.770 --> 04:48.838
- Oh, I'd love to, it's just I
have a lot of tables right now.

04:48.840 --> 04:51.741
- Okay, well um,
maybe we can hang out after?

04:51.743 --> 04:52.742
I was thinking we could have
a little ladies' night

04:52.744 --> 04:55.478
at my place.

04:55.480 --> 04:57.580
- Just the two of us?
- Yeah!

04:57.582 --> 04:59.649
Come by around eight.

04:59.651 --> 05:02.151
- I'm working tonight,
but maybe this weekend?

05:02.153 --> 05:04.520
Or are you with Mutt
on weekends?

05:04.522 --> 05:08.157
- Um no, because we broke up.

05:08.159 --> 05:10.560
- I'm sorry to hear that.

05:10.562 --> 05:12.995
Although, part of me
is a little relieved.

05:12.997 --> 05:14.363
Since you did tell me
to break up with him,

05:14.365 --> 05:16.599
and then you dated him...

05:16.601 --> 05:19.635
- That's so sweet of you,
but I'm gonna be fine.

05:19.637 --> 05:21.671
So how late do you have
to work tonight?

05:21.673 --> 05:24.206
- Um, until people leave,
I guess.

05:24.208 --> 05:25.942
- And when do people leave?

05:25.944 --> 05:28.311
- I don't know,
after people clear out.

05:28.313 --> 05:29.912
- Okay, well when
everybody clears out,

05:29.914 --> 05:33.482
you can just pop by.

05:33.484 --> 05:36.519
- You know, when I broke up
with Mutt,

05:36.521 --> 05:39.155
I just took a lot of alone
time to rebuild,

05:39.157 --> 05:42.458
and regroup, and I just,
I think it's so important.

05:42.460 --> 05:43.726
- Yeah, and I'm doing the same
kind of thing right now.

05:43.728 --> 05:47.363
'Cause it's so important.

05:47.365 --> 05:49.999
- All right, good.

05:50.001 --> 05:52.234
Because you know what they say,
if you can't be by yourself,

05:52.236 --> 05:54.437
then you probably shouldn't be
in a relationship.

05:54.439 --> 05:56.105
- Mmhmm, I totally get that.

05:59.010 --> 06:02.244
But call me if you happen
to get off work early.

06:02.246 --> 06:05.181
Twy? Call me if you get
off work early!

06:05.933 --> 06:10.202
♪♪

06:10.204 --> 06:12.571
- All right. (Laughs)

06:12.573 --> 06:14.806
I know. I know!

06:14.808 --> 06:16.908
- Hey, Roland.
- Uh-huh.

06:16.910 --> 06:19.311
All right, so one o'clock,
then? All right, terrific.

06:19.313 --> 06:21.780
Yeah, no, I look forward
to catching up.

06:21.782 --> 06:24.516
Great, yep, you too.
Okay, all right.

06:24.518 --> 06:26.852
Buh-bye!
Sorry, Johnny.

06:26.854 --> 06:29.788
I just had to reschedule
my colonoscopy.

06:29.790 --> 06:33.191
- Oh. Well, I just stopped by
to pick up

06:33.193 --> 06:36.962
a nomination form
for town council.

06:36.964 --> 06:39.831
- You know, I gotta hand
it to you.

06:39.833 --> 06:42.734
It takes a brave man
to face defeat yet again,

06:42.736 --> 06:44.936
when his ego is so battered
and bruised.

06:44.938 --> 06:47.005
- Well, I don't plan on losing,

06:47.007 --> 06:49.307
but thank you for the vote
of confidence.

06:49.309 --> 06:51.376
- Johnny, nobody plans
on losing.

06:51.378 --> 06:53.311
But with all due respect,

06:53.313 --> 06:57.015
this is a kind of a different
playing field for you.

06:57.017 --> 07:00.385
- Roland, I ran the second
largest retail video chain

07:00.387 --> 07:02.287
in North America, so...

07:02.289 --> 07:03.655
- Well, that's good to hear,

07:03.657 --> 07:05.457
so you're used to coming
in second, huh?

07:05.459 --> 07:08.393
- Could I get a nomination
form, please?!

07:08.395 --> 07:10.395
- Look I'm just trying to help
you out here, okay?

07:10.397 --> 07:12.197
I've been in politics
for 18 years,

07:12.199 --> 07:13.598
and let me tell you something,
pal,

07:13.600 --> 07:15.834
it ain't a cakewalk, okay?!
Say goodbye to your privacy.

07:15.836 --> 07:17.536
You walk into a restaurant,

07:17.538 --> 07:19.004
everybody's gonna know
who you are!

07:19.006 --> 07:20.705
- Well, everyone knows
everyone here,

07:20.707 --> 07:22.374
because there's only one
restaurant.

07:22.376 --> 07:23.909
- I mean, just taking your boy
for ice cream cone

07:23.911 --> 07:26.111
can turn into a media circus.

07:26.113 --> 07:28.480
- Well, your son is 30,
and you never see him.

07:28.482 --> 07:30.849
Could I get a form, Roland?
Please?

07:30.851 --> 07:33.585
- You know what?

07:33.587 --> 07:36.221
I'll do you one better,
I'll give you the form,

07:36.223 --> 07:37.722
und your first signature.

07:40.060 --> 07:42.427
- Oh, wow.
- There you go, how 'bout that?

07:42.429 --> 07:43.929
- Thank you.
- You're very welcome.

07:43.931 --> 07:45.664
- You signed under "Date."

07:45.666 --> 07:47.032
- Yeah, like that's going
to make a difference.

07:47.034 --> 07:48.066
- Okay.

07:50.103 --> 07:52.571
- Rrrrrr! Come're, you!
I'm thirsty!

07:56.577 --> 07:58.977
- Exciting afternoon?

07:58.979 --> 08:01.813
- Thrilling, can't you tell?
- What are you doing tonight?

08:01.815 --> 08:04.216
- Uh, I'm busy.
- With what?

08:04.218 --> 08:06.451
- I'm going out.
- With who?

08:06.453 --> 08:08.987
- Does it matter?
- Where are you going?

08:08.989 --> 08:10.689
- None of your business!

08:10.691 --> 08:12.457
- Are you seeing someone?

08:14.428 --> 08:16.194
- Not exactly.

08:16.196 --> 08:18.697
- Okay, you're sounding
very sketchy right now.

08:18.699 --> 08:20.131
- I'm going to a bar
to meet someone.

08:20.133 --> 08:24.035
- Who?!
- I don't know yet.

08:24.037 --> 08:27.005
- Ohh... So she's going
to a bar to get laid, then.

08:27.007 --> 08:29.007
I see...
- Uh no,

08:29.009 --> 08:32.377
she is going to a bar
to have her needs met

08:32.379 --> 08:34.312
by some lovely gentleman
she's yet to meet,

08:34.314 --> 08:35.847
who is cute enough
to sleep with,

08:35.849 --> 08:39.651
but not nearly mature
or stable enough to marry.

08:39.653 --> 08:41.419
- I want that.

08:41.421 --> 08:43.255
- Well, you can't come.

08:43.257 --> 08:45.056
'Cause everyone will think
we're together.

08:45.058 --> 08:47.659
- Okay, I think you're giving
yourself a lot of credit.

08:47.661 --> 08:49.628
- I was being generous.

08:49.630 --> 08:51.496
- No, We're gonna be each
other's wing people tonight.

08:51.498 --> 08:53.598
Um now, how diverse
is the clientele

08:55.302 --> 08:57.536
at this local drinkery?

08:57.538 --> 08:59.638
- I would say very diverse.

08:59.640 --> 09:02.274
- I can't remember what life
was like before dating apps.

09:02.276 --> 09:04.276
I'm both excited and terrified
for tonight.

09:04.278 --> 09:06.177
- I don't think I ever said
you could come.

09:06.179 --> 09:08.680
- Okay, so what time, though?
And is there a dress code?

09:08.682 --> 09:10.048
'Cause I just want to come
prepared.

09:10.050 --> 09:11.983
(Slams door)

09:11.985 --> 09:13.752
- So that I can meet somebody.

09:13.754 --> 09:15.854
(Makes popping sound)

09:15.856 --> 09:19.257
I'm in Room 7 in case
you need me.

09:19.259 --> 09:20.959
See you later.

09:20.961 --> 09:22.260
This is gonna be so fun for us.

09:27.501 --> 09:29.301
- You know, it's uh...

09:29.303 --> 09:32.003
It's a funny thing,

09:32.005 --> 09:34.606
there seems to be a rumour
going around about me.

09:34.608 --> 09:36.408
- I heard that one,

09:36.410 --> 09:37.342
it's only because you converse
with women easily,

09:37.344 --> 09:39.277
and you dress so well.

09:39.279 --> 09:41.680
I wouldn't give it
another thought.

09:41.682 --> 09:42.356
- What?

09:42.382 --> 09:45.050
- I'm sorry, which rumour
are you talking about?

09:45.052 --> 09:47.953
- The one about me
running for council.

09:47.955 --> 09:50.055
- No, that was about me, John.

09:50.057 --> 09:52.290
You were with me
when Twyla said that.

09:52.292 --> 09:54.025
If this continues, I'll have
to call a neurologist.

09:54.027 --> 09:56.795
- No, this is another rumour,
Moira.

09:56.797 --> 09:59.998
A rumour about me
running for council.

10:00.000 --> 10:02.033
- From whom did you hear
this one?

10:02.035 --> 10:03.735
- Well, I-I don't know
where it started,

10:03.737 --> 10:06.638
but the gist of it
is I'd be a shoo-in,

10:06.640 --> 10:08.707
and could really get things
done.

10:08.709 --> 10:10.008
- Well, there's no question
about it.

10:10.010 --> 10:11.743
You'd be a godsend to council.

10:11.745 --> 10:13.878
- Well, thank you sweetheart,
I agree.

10:13.880 --> 10:15.080
- But they'll never know
about it,

10:15.082 --> 10:16.915
because you have much
bigger plans.

10:16.917 --> 10:19.317
- Yes, I know, well...

10:19.319 --> 10:21.820
- I see you go into the office
every day, pistons firing,

10:21.822 --> 10:23.722
you are full of ideas,

10:23.724 --> 10:25.390
and you haven't told me
what they are yet,

10:25.392 --> 10:28.126
but I have every confidence
that they are brilliant.

10:28.128 --> 10:32.063
- Yeah, yeah... Well,
who says I can't do both?

10:32.065 --> 10:34.566
Moira, being on council
could leverage our position

10:34.568 --> 10:37.469
considerably in this town.
- It's not worth it.

10:37.471 --> 10:40.805
You saw me struggle to get those
modest planters for the motel.

10:40.807 --> 10:42.941
Trying to council to focus
on the simplest thing

10:42.943 --> 10:45.510
is like wrangling monkeys!

10:45.512 --> 10:47.045
- Well, I can wrangle monkeys.

10:47.047 --> 10:49.547
It's called running a business.

10:49.549 --> 10:51.916
- Yes, you could, but you'd be
wasting your talents on these people.

10:51.918 --> 10:53.785
- Yeah well,
that goes without saying.

10:53.787 --> 10:55.787
Listen, I know it's a giant
step down

10:55.789 --> 10:57.489
from anything I've done
in the past, but--

10:57.491 --> 11:00.358
- Exactly, it's beneath you.

11:00.360 --> 11:02.827
- Well, I just...

11:02.829 --> 11:05.130
worry that the people who were
spreading this rumour

11:05.132 --> 11:07.532
might be a little disappointed,
that's all.

11:07.534 --> 11:09.401
- Well, you can't worry
about them.

11:09.403 --> 11:10.802
(Kiss)

11:20.180 --> 11:21.046
(Birds chirp)

11:22.683 --> 11:24.315
- Hey!
- Hey.

11:28.321 --> 11:29.788
(Sighs contentedly)

11:33.927 --> 11:35.827
- Are you waiting for someone?

11:35.829 --> 11:39.330
- No, I'm just taking
some "me time."

11:39.332 --> 11:40.899
- Oh, okay...

11:43.303 --> 11:45.170
I hope I'm not getting
in the way of that.

11:45.172 --> 11:46.638
- No, no, you're good.

11:51.878 --> 11:54.245
So, Stevie...

11:54.247 --> 11:56.881
you're a strong woman
who's alone a lot.

11:56.883 --> 11:58.917
Like, I know you dated David,

11:58.919 --> 12:01.920
but everyone's allowed
a mistake, am I right?

12:01.922 --> 12:03.388
- You sound like my conscience.

12:03.390 --> 12:04.823
- Is it hard for you?

12:06.693 --> 12:08.626
- Uh, is what hard for me?

12:08.628 --> 12:11.196
- Like, being by yourself here?

12:11.198 --> 12:14.332
Like, you're just totally okay
to sit here all day by yourself?

12:14.334 --> 12:15.533
- That's why I took the job.

12:15.535 --> 12:18.369
- Mmhm. Okay.

12:18.371 --> 12:20.371
And while you're here,
by yourself,

12:20.373 --> 12:23.541
you never get this almost
uncontrollable urge

12:23.543 --> 12:27.011
to talk to people,
or be complimented, or...

12:27.013 --> 12:29.047
- I know everyone in this town,

12:29.049 --> 12:32.751
so for the most part, I would
rather be here by myself

12:32.753 --> 12:34.619
than engage in meaningless
conversation

12:34.621 --> 12:37.288
with people I don't care about.

12:37.290 --> 12:40.558
- Totally.

12:40.560 --> 12:43.661
- Mmhm... And why is that?

12:43.663 --> 12:46.131
- Because I enjoy
my own company more.

12:46.133 --> 12:48.600
- Of course. Of course.

12:52.539 --> 12:53.805
Okay.

12:53.806 --> 12:55.072
JOCELYN: Can I have everyone's
attention, please?

12:55.075 --> 12:58.109
If I could just- okay.
Thanks, Jazzagals.

12:58.111 --> 13:00.245
I just wanted to grab your ear
for just a second,

13:00.247 --> 13:02.714
to make a quick announcement.

13:02.716 --> 13:06.651
I will not be at rehearsals for
the next two weeks, because...

13:06.653 --> 13:07.786
I have decided to throw
my hat in the ring,

13:07.788 --> 13:09.888
and run for council!

13:09.890 --> 13:12.257
JAZZAGALS: (Gasps) Oh, Jocelyn!
That's great! Oh my gosh!

13:12.259 --> 13:14.793
(Applause) That's amazing!

13:14.795 --> 13:16.528
- I'm currently running
unopposed.

13:16.530 --> 13:19.731
So that kinda takes away
the excitement of winning,

13:19.733 --> 13:22.901
you know, but still, I think
it's gonna be a real hoot.

13:22.903 --> 13:24.502
JAZZAGALS: That's so fun! Congratulations!
Good going! Good for you!

13:24.504 --> 13:26.571
- Thank you.

13:26.573 --> 13:28.306
JAZZAGALS: That's awesome!
That's great!

13:28.308 --> 13:31.910
- So Jocelyn, good for you.
Taking on a new little project.

13:31.912 --> 13:33.945
- Thanks I'm really looking
forward to it.

13:33.947 --> 13:35.880
- You know what's funny,
just this morning,

13:35.882 --> 13:38.383
Twyla asked me if I was running
for council.

13:38.385 --> 13:40.752
- That is funny.

13:40.754 --> 13:42.420
I mean, unless you're thinking
of running.

13:42.422 --> 13:44.622
- Mm, no. No, no.

13:44.624 --> 13:48.193
Can you imagine?
- No! (Laughs)

13:48.195 --> 13:50.195
I mean, just because you've
spent all your time

13:50.197 --> 13:52.864
trying to sell the town
and get outta here, so.

13:52.866 --> 13:55.867
- Twyla dear, what was it
this morning that made you say

13:55.869 --> 13:58.503
I would make such
a great councilwoman?

13:58.505 --> 14:02.140
- Oh, I just heard
you were running.

14:02.142 --> 14:04.909
- Are you?              - No!
- I...

14:04.911 --> 14:07.879
- She's not interested
in politics!

14:07.881 --> 14:10.882
- Although I can see why
someone might think that.

14:10.884 --> 14:12.483
I certainly know how
to command a crowd,

14:12.485 --> 14:16.187
and I've never been one
to shy away from a good fight.

14:16.189 --> 14:19.290
- I don't think it's such a bad
idea for someone else to run.

14:19.292 --> 14:22.627
A little healthy competition
never hurt anyone.

14:22.629 --> 14:25.630
- Yeah, a real election race
could be fun!

14:25.632 --> 14:27.966
- Absolutely, I mean,
I wouldn't want anyone

14:27.968 --> 14:29.567
to think that I was just
stepping into this,

14:29.569 --> 14:32.203
you know, because of Roland.

14:32.205 --> 14:34.239
Yeah, I mean, if any
of you townies

14:34.241 --> 14:35.740
wanna put your name
on the ballot,

14:35.742 --> 14:37.709
I think that's just
a great idea.

14:37.711 --> 14:39.978
- That's the spirit.

14:39.980 --> 14:43.114
If Jocelyn can do it,
anyone can.

14:43.116 --> 14:44.816
- Yeah.
- Yeah. Places!

14:44.818 --> 14:47.252
Don't you think?

14:47.254 --> 14:50.521
- Hmm... On a scale of one

14:50.523 --> 14:52.123
to I'm-gonna-get-beat-up
by-an-angry-local,

14:52.125 --> 14:54.225
where do we see this look fall?

14:54.227 --> 14:57.195
- Um, like, easy six.

14:57.197 --> 14:59.631
- Okay.
- Where are you going?

14:59.633 --> 15:02.934
- I am going to a sketchy bar
on the outskirts of town.

15:02.936 --> 15:04.736
- And nobody invited me?!

15:04.738 --> 15:06.070
You know how at home I am
at sketchy bars!

15:06.072 --> 15:07.572
Who are you going with?

15:07.574 --> 15:09.807
- With Stevie, we're gonna meet
some randoms.

15:09.809 --> 15:12.944
So um, when I go missing,

15:12.946 --> 15:15.246
just feel free to tell people
that the last place I was seen

15:15.248 --> 15:17.949
was at a sketchy bar on the
outskirts of town meeting randoms.

15:17.951 --> 15:19.550
- Okay well, this isn't fair,
David.

15:19.552 --> 15:21.953
I'm the one who should be at
a sketchy bar meeting randoms.

15:21.955 --> 15:23.688
I'm the one who should
go missing!

15:23.690 --> 15:25.957
- Well then, come!
- (Sighs) I can't.

15:25.959 --> 15:27.759
- Why?
- Well, for one thing,

15:27.761 --> 15:29.794
this mask doesn't come off
for another twenty minutes.

15:29.796 --> 15:32.563
- You look beautiful.
- Thank you.

15:32.565 --> 15:35.300
And... second, I told myself
that I would enjoy

15:35.302 --> 15:38.469
my own company tonight.

15:38.471 --> 15:40.772
- Okay um, well, we're going
to a bar,

15:40.774 --> 15:42.640
and you're on the rebound,
so text me when you're dressed.

15:42.642 --> 15:44.342
- I'm serious, David,
I'm not coming.

15:44.344 --> 15:46.077
Have fun, though.

15:46.079 --> 15:48.012
Oh, and in case
you wake up in a chair

15:48.014 --> 15:50.114
with your hands duct taped
together,

15:50.116 --> 15:51.683
you can snap the duct tape

15:51.685 --> 15:53.318
by just raising your hands
over your head,

15:53.320 --> 15:56.587
and then bringing them down
really hard.

15:56.589 --> 16:00.024
- Thanks. Um... see you there?

16:00.026 --> 16:02.226
- I'm not coming.
- (Scoffs)

16:02.228 --> 16:03.294
(Door slams)

16:05.732 --> 16:07.632
- I'm not coming.

16:09.602 --> 16:10.735
(Sighs)

16:13.540 --> 16:16.574
- Hi, Moira. How was rehearsal?

16:16.576 --> 16:19.077
- It was quite an afternoon.
Oh John, thank you.

16:19.079 --> 16:21.312
- Listen, I just wanted
to thank you

16:21.314 --> 16:24.248
for what you said this morning.
- And what's that?

16:24.250 --> 16:27.752
- When we had our little talk
about me running for council.

16:27.754 --> 16:29.721
I have to admit I'd given it
a little more thought

16:29.723 --> 16:31.389
than I'd let on.

16:31.391 --> 16:33.024
- Oh?
- Yes.

16:33.026 --> 16:35.593
I actually picked up
a nomination form.

16:35.595 --> 16:38.429
- Really John, I didn't realize.

16:38.431 --> 16:40.832
- No, no, no, I'm glad
you talked me out of it.

16:40.834 --> 16:42.600
- Okay.
- Yeah, because I thought about the job,

16:42.602 --> 16:44.469
what it would entail,
and you know, listen,

16:44.471 --> 16:46.537
Roland drives me crazy
when he's not even around,

16:46.539 --> 16:48.072
but can you imagine?
- No!

16:48.074 --> 16:50.141
- Working with him every day?

16:50.143 --> 16:52.777
- Huh! I'm laughing
about it right now.

16:54.948 --> 16:58.049
Did you know Jocelyn
is running?

16:58.051 --> 17:01.085
- No, oh my God!
This gets better and better.

17:01.087 --> 17:04.355
So the two of them
on council together?

17:04.357 --> 17:06.624
- Is there a more frightening
thought?

17:06.626 --> 17:09.093
They would have a virtual
monopoly on this town.

17:09.095 --> 17:10.728
- Well, don't they already?

17:10.730 --> 17:13.765
- Exactly, I think someone
needs to challenge them!

17:13.767 --> 17:16.167
- Right!

17:16.169 --> 17:18.803
So... what are you saying?

17:18.805 --> 17:22.240
That I should run?
- No. Nope.

17:22.242 --> 17:23.708
- Because I did get five
signatures

17:23.710 --> 17:25.943
on my nomination form, and I--

17:25.945 --> 17:27.812
- No! No, no, no, John, you've
got enough on your plate.

17:27.814 --> 17:29.747
- Oh.
- Whereas I...

17:29.749 --> 17:32.350
have nothing but free time.

17:35.488 --> 17:39.090
- I'm not exactly sure
where this is going.

17:39.092 --> 17:41.025
- John, you have the family
to think about.

17:41.027 --> 17:43.528
You're going to accomplish
wonderfully big things.

17:43.530 --> 17:46.864
Town council would just
hold you back.

17:46.866 --> 17:49.500
- But something tells me
it will not be...

17:49.502 --> 17:51.269
holding you back?

17:51.271 --> 17:53.337
- It would be a few weeks
of my time.

17:53.339 --> 17:56.274
And you know, someone said it
might be a nice project for me.

17:56.276 --> 17:58.709
- And would that someone
be you?

17:58.711 --> 18:00.878
- Jocelyn practically begged me
to take the bait!

18:00.880 --> 18:04.182
- So you're running
for council?!

18:04.184 --> 18:08.052
- Looks like it.
- Oh well, isn't that wonderful!

18:08.054 --> 18:09.787
Isn't that wonderful!

18:09.789 --> 18:12.090
Hey, that's really good news.

18:12.092 --> 18:13.624
- I'm sorry, John,
I just got swept up in it.

18:13.626 --> 18:16.194
- No, no, listen as long
as one of us is running, okay?

18:16.196 --> 18:17.695
that's the important thing.

18:17.697 --> 18:19.163
It doesn't matter which
one of us is running.

18:19.165 --> 18:20.698
I thought it would be me,

18:20.700 --> 18:23.734
but then you talked me out
of it! But that's okay!

18:23.736 --> 18:25.970
- Please John, I'm going to
need you every step of the way.

18:25.972 --> 18:27.338
- And I'll be right
behind you Moira,

18:27.340 --> 18:29.006
supporting you, because...

18:29.008 --> 18:30.808
you're the one running,
and I'm not!

18:30.810 --> 18:31.943
- How long are we going
to be doing this?

18:31.945 --> 18:34.579
- Oh, just a few more minutes,
at least.

18:38.151 --> 18:39.717
(Twangy blues song plays)

18:41.688 --> 18:45.223
- It's not usually this dead.

18:45.225 --> 18:48.926
It's like everybody saw
you coming, and left.

18:48.928 --> 18:50.061
- Is this really what
our lives have become?

18:50.063 --> 18:52.763
Sitting in some sad...

18:52.765 --> 18:55.833
bar waiting to get laid?

18:55.835 --> 18:57.568
- Well it's this,
or the internet.

18:57.570 --> 18:59.904
- Oh, I did have a match
earlier.

18:59.906 --> 19:03.441
Um who is... 79 miles away.

19:03.443 --> 19:04.642
- Well, if you start walking
now,

19:04.644 --> 19:06.611
you'll get there before
breakfast.

19:06.613 --> 19:08.946
- Alexis is supposed to be
meeting us here.

19:08.948 --> 19:10.515
She said she wasn't coming,
but this is a bar,

19:10.517 --> 19:14.619
and she is single, so.

19:14.621 --> 19:16.087
- Well, you should warn her
that we are the only people

19:16.089 --> 19:17.321
here under sixty.

19:21.828 --> 19:25.530
- Yeah, it's not...
not brimming with options.

19:25.532 --> 19:26.631
- No.

19:29.869 --> 19:32.036
(David takes a deep breath)

19:36.009 --> 19:50.621
♪♪

19:50.623 --> 19:52.990
- Nope.
- No!

19:52.992 --> 19:54.892
- No, it didn't feel right.
- No, it didn't.

19:54.894 --> 19:57.395
- Well, at least we tried.

19:57.397 --> 19:59.096
- I agree.

20:05.171 --> 20:08.039
Oh, uh, I notice that man
is no longer sleeping

20:08.041 --> 20:09.540
under the pool table.

20:12.412 --> 20:14.245
- Well, I'm surprisingly
good at pool.

20:14.247 --> 20:16.380
So...
- Hmm!

20:16.382 --> 20:18.316
Wait a second, is this like
a reverse hustle,

20:18.318 --> 20:20.818
where you say you're good,
but you're actually terrible?

20:20.820 --> 20:23.854
- Um, I don't know.

20:23.856 --> 20:25.556
- Do you wanna break?

20:25.558 --> 20:27.558
- Um, from what?

20:27.560 --> 20:28.593
- Oh, this is gonna be fun.

20:32.899 --> 20:35.833
(Lock rattles)

20:35.835 --> 20:37.134
(Sighs)

20:50.984 --> 20:52.850
(Crickets chirp)

20:57.890 --> 20:59.790
(Light footsteps)

21:13.640 --> 21:15.373
ALEXIS: Don't, David.

21:15.375 --> 21:16.507
I have nowhere else
to put stuff.
