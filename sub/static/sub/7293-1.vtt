00:18.989 --> 00:21.063
So Dad's gonna bring pizza home.

00:23.427 --> 00:24.870
Lucy?

00:28.532 --> 00:30.004
Lucy!

00:30.867 --> 00:32.715
Don't call me that.

00:35.605 --> 00:37.656
What would you like me to call you?

00:38.608 --> 00:41.078
Lucinda. It's more adult.

00:41.508 --> 00:42.958
Okay.

00:48.885 --> 00:50.687
So, Lucinda, huh?

00:51.087 --> 00:52.589
Yeah.

00:53.489 --> 00:57.427
It wasn't that long ago you'd have me climb
into bed with you when you had a nightmare.

00:57.527 --> 00:59.606
Whatever. I was four.

01:03.133 --> 01:05.702
I, uh, I need to ask you something.

01:05.802 --> 01:07.504
What is it?

01:07.604 --> 01:11.374
So, there's this camping trip...

01:11.474 --> 01:14.949
...and everyone's going.

01:15.912 --> 01:17.715
That's not a question.

01:18.315 --> 01:20.150
Can I go?

01:20.950 --> 01:22.953
Isn't it a little cold to go camping?

01:23.553 --> 01:25.356
We're staying in a cabin.

01:26.356 --> 01:28.359
Are there gonna be any parents?

01:29.059 --> 01:31.928
- No.
- Are there gonna be boys?

01:32.028 --> 01:33.437
No.

01:37.033 --> 01:40.470
- Morgan's going.
- That's of very little comfort.

01:40.570 --> 01:42.581
Please, Mom?

01:46.610 --> 01:48.512
Sorry, Lucy.
I just don't think it's a good idea.

01:48.612 --> 01:50.419
This is not fair.

01:52.516 --> 01:56.753
Yeah, and... if your aunt had
a mustache, she'd be your uncle.

01:56.853 --> 01:59.127
I fucking hate it when you say that.

02:10.433 --> 02:12.436
You're not going.
And you talk to me like that again...

02:12.536 --> 02:15.149
...you're not going anywhere
for a very long time.

02:26.383 --> 02:28.793
You have to trust
I'm just looking out for you.

02:30.287 --> 02:31.898
Okay, Lucy?

02:33.623 --> 02:35.559
- Lucinda...
- I'm walking home.

02:35.659 --> 02:38.945
Lucy, come on. Lucy! Lucy!

03:30.414 --> 03:32.102
<i># So #</i>

03:32.202 --> 03:35.352
<i># The wind blew for days #</i>

03:35.452 --> 03:37.787
<i># In so many ways #</i>

03:37.887 --> 03:41.933
<i># You were buried in clout #</i>

03:43.893 --> 03:48.765
<i># But now, it's left you alone #</i>

03:48.865 --> 03:51.001
<i># You're drenched to the bone #</i>

03:51.101 --> 03:54.903
<i># But you're safe now somehow #</i>

03:58.908 --> 04:02.312
<i># The gales #</i>

04:02.412 --> 04:05.259
<i># Had died #</i>

04:12.088 --> 04:15.492
<i># And your clothes #</i>

04:15.592 --> 04:18.999
<i># Will dry #</i>

04:37.213 --> 04:41.535
<i># Your questions drifted away... ##</i>

04:41.635 --> 04:43.165
Tess?

04:46.055 --> 04:47.598
Tess?

05:00.036 --> 05:01.608
So...

05:04.908 --> 05:06.786
...what'd you think?

06:54.250 --> 06:56.057
This is different.

07:08.263 --> 07:11.925
- <i>You bring your skateboard?</i>
- It's your skateboard.

07:12.025 --> 07:13.915
<i>It's yours now.</i>

07:14.671 --> 07:16.005
Okay.

07:16.105 --> 07:19.743
She shouldn't skate around here.
There aren't any sidewalks.

07:19.843 --> 07:22.445
<i>Tell your mom not to be such a fuddy duddy.</i>

07:22.545 --> 07:24.603
Don't be such a fuddy duddy.

07:25.103 --> 07:26.979
<i>Is she shaking her head?</i>

07:28.117 --> 07:29.589
Yeah.

07:31.521 --> 07:34.124
<i>Have you been playing
those cords I taught you?</i>

07:34.824 --> 07:38.628
A little bit. The strings hurt my fingers.

07:39.328 --> 07:42.933
<i>The skin will get harder the more you play,
then you won't feel anything.</i>

07:43.533 --> 07:45.102
Okay.

07:46.402 --> 07:48.605
<i>We'll practice together when I come home.</i>

07:48.905 --> 07:50.840
When will you come home?

07:51.840 --> 07:53.254
<i>Soon.</i>

08:04.320 --> 08:06.823
<i>So I'm gonna be coming home late from work.</i>

08:06.923 --> 08:08.791
<i>Just like the last job.</i>

08:08.891 --> 08:12.095
<i>Yeah. I double-checked with the principal...</i>

08:12.195 --> 08:15.064
<i>...and she still thinks you
should start after winter break.</i>

08:15.564 --> 08:17.216
<i>'Kay.</i>

08:17.866 --> 08:19.736
<i>You'll get a fresh start.</i>

08:43.259 --> 08:45.218
<i>You took your pill, right?</i>

08:45.728 --> 08:47.264
Yes.

08:48.364 --> 08:51.410
You have to take your pill everyday,
and you get that, right?

08:51.510 --> 08:53.316
I know.

10:14.517 --> 10:16.559
Come here, boy!

11:02.732 --> 11:04.634
Hello. Father Meyers.

11:04.734 --> 11:06.270
Jessica.

11:07.370 --> 11:10.607
- This is Tess.
- Short for Theresa.

11:11.507 --> 11:13.509
Please don't call me that.

11:13.609 --> 11:15.883
- Tess.
- Sorry.

11:18.614 --> 11:21.184
I'll make sure to say a prayer...

11:21.484 --> 11:23.362
Thank you, father.

11:24.754 --> 11:26.964
- Tess?
- Thank you.

11:27.857 --> 11:29.500
Hello.

11:39.836 --> 11:41.479
Sarah?

11:43.539 --> 11:45.108
It's...

11:45.658 --> 11:47.532
Haven't see you here in a while.

11:49.946 --> 11:51.960
Is there anything we can do for you?

11:53.783 --> 11:56.257
No. Thank you.

12:43.166 --> 12:45.180
Did you have a bad dream?

13:39.338 --> 13:41.640
<i>Hey, this is Lucy's phone.
I'm not here right now.</i>

13:41.740 --> 13:43.926
<i>Leave a message, and I might get back to you.</i>

14:05.214 --> 14:07.250
What're you gonna do today?

14:07.350 --> 14:08.864
Read.

14:10.619 --> 14:12.297
Explore.

14:14.090 --> 14:15.592
Hey.

14:16.092 --> 14:18.166
Remember what Dr. Petty said?

14:20.313 --> 14:22.337
Always make eye contact.

15:48.401 --> 15:50.653
<i># I stood alone #</i>

15:51.353 --> 15:54.432
<i># And watched you go, baby #</i>

15:56.192 --> 15:58.345
<i># My crying voice #</i>

15:59.195 --> 16:01.639
<i># Was out of range #</i>

16:04.200 --> 16:06.603
<i># And as I stood #</i>

16:07.303 --> 16:09.943
<i># With none beside me #</i>

16:12.375 --> 16:15.911
<i># I felt the seasons in me #</i>

16:16.011 --> 16:17.828
<i># Change #</i>

16:24.019 --> 16:26.431
<i># And a part of me #</i>

16:27.203 --> 16:29.604
<i># Has lost my mother #</i>

16:32.161 --> 16:34.397
<i># And a part of me #</i>

16:35.197 --> 16:37.444
<i># Has lost a child #</i>

16:40.569 --> 16:43.639
<i># And part of me #</i>

16:43.739 --> 16:48.544
<i># Will rise from my roots #</i>

16:48.644 --> 16:53.323
<i># At least not for a little while #</i>

17:00.356 --> 17:02.626
<i># I think of you #</i>

17:03.426 --> 17:05.840
<i># When I walk this city #</i>

17:08.431 --> 17:11.701
<i># And I'll hold you more #</i>

17:11.800 --> 17:14.211
<i># Than time to time #</i>

17:16.972 --> 17:19.375
<i># And even though #</i>

17:19.775 --> 17:22.446
<i># It's such a pity #</i>

17:24.847 --> 17:26.749
<i># Can't make myself #</i>

17:26.848 --> 17:29.867
<i># Just leave these behind ##</i>

19:47.022 --> 19:51.727
<i>Anxiety, depression,
disruptive behavior disorder...</i>

19:51.827 --> 19:53.496
<i>...hallucinations.</i>

19:53.596 --> 19:56.031
She's been in and out of hospitals...

19:56.131 --> 19:59.548
...on different medications
practically her whole life.

20:00.302 --> 20:02.492
I remember the first time.

20:03.772 --> 20:05.615
She was five.

20:08.143 --> 20:10.013
She was sitting in a corner...

20:10.813 --> 20:13.303
...all hunched up and...

20:15.284 --> 20:19.014
...and just knocking her head
against the wall...

20:19.921 --> 20:22.488
<i>...over and over.</i>

20:28.897 --> 20:33.144
And we were so young when we had her.

20:34.837 --> 20:38.129
At her age now, actually.

20:40.643 --> 20:42.211
I've...

20:42.911 --> 20:44.925
...tried so hard.

20:47.316 --> 20:51.328
I've made so many mistakes.

20:54.223 --> 20:57.793
But then I think she's good now.

20:57.893 --> 21:00.229
It looks like you've done well, Jessica.

21:01.029 --> 21:03.301
<i>She seems like a...</i>

21:03.401 --> 21:04.900
<i>...teenager.</i>

21:05.000 --> 21:07.154
Tess, come in for dinner.

22:34.423 --> 22:36.925
All right. You want this door open or closed?

22:37.025 --> 22:38.832
It doesn't matter.

26:03.582 --> 26:05.396
What're you doing?

26:06.802 --> 26:08.321
Just looking.

26:09.021 --> 26:10.835
It's freezing out here.

29:26.051 --> 29:29.788
<i># You and I together #</i>

29:29.888 --> 29:33.702
<i># You're the jewel in my crown #</i>

29:35.060 --> 29:39.031
<i># You and I forever #</i>

29:39.131 --> 29:43.169
<i># What goes up must come down #</i>

29:43.869 --> 29:48.273
<i># And you go north till it's south #</i>

29:48.373 --> 29:51.911
<i># And you come back around #</i>

29:53.211 --> 29:56.882
<i># I could never leave you #</i>

29:57.182 --> 30:00.832
<i># No matter if I tried #</i>

30:02.220 --> 30:06.625
<i># And if you ever ran, I'd retrieve you #</i>

30:06.725 --> 30:10.607
<i># To keep you satisfied #</i>

30:12.430 --> 30:16.468
<i># And you can't run, and you can't hide #</i>

30:16.568 --> 30:20.209
<i># But I'll love you till I die ##</i>

30:22.040 --> 30:23.842
What're you singing?

30:24.642 --> 30:27.717
Nothing. I just make it up as I go along.

30:31.716 --> 30:35.186
Peter asked if you were coming
on the camping trip.

30:40.858 --> 30:43.428
I'd have to buy a new swimsuit
that hides my scar.

30:43.528 --> 30:46.198
Oh, screw that. Your scar's cool.

30:46.298 --> 30:48.581
Peter says it's like a badass tattoo.

30:51.770 --> 30:54.444
So, wait, does that mean your mom said yes?

30:59.244 --> 31:01.088
Lucinda.

31:02.948 --> 31:04.980
You haven't even asked her yet, have you?

31:05.080 --> 31:08.320
- No, not yet.
- Sarah's cool. She'll say yes.

31:08.420 --> 31:11.122
- "Sarah's cool"?
- Cooler than my mom.

31:11.222 --> 31:13.792
Yeah. Morgan, that's not hard.

31:13.892 --> 31:16.266
Don't talk about my mom, bitch.

31:18.897 --> 31:22.572
Sarah gets it. She's, like, worldly.

31:23.268 --> 31:25.603
- "Worldly"?
- Yeah.

31:25.703 --> 31:27.505
Worldly.

31:27.605 --> 31:30.008
Come on. Your grandparents are missionaries.

31:30.108 --> 31:34.213
They didn't stick around long.
And all she ever did was end up back here.

31:34.946 --> 31:36.949
She's never gonna let me go.

31:37.649 --> 31:40.117
Well, tell her I'm going.
That'll make her happy.

31:40.217 --> 31:43.496
- Yeah.
- Just ask her, you wuss.

32:43.798 --> 32:45.686
Can I help you?

32:50.255 --> 32:51.542
Alrighty, then.

33:11.142 --> 33:14.021
I used to have a necklace
just like that once.

33:19.784 --> 33:22.198
How come nobody ever comes in here?

33:23.121 --> 33:24.964
Excuse me.

33:26.391 --> 33:28.226
I'm always across the street.

33:28.726 --> 33:30.604
Nobody ever comes in.

33:32.397 --> 33:34.411
No one reads books anymore.

33:35.033 --> 33:37.911
- I like them.
- I do, too.

33:39.371 --> 33:41.840
I just wish we weren't the only ones.

33:42.840 --> 33:45.678
If your aunt had a mustache,
she'd be your uncle.

33:46.578 --> 33:48.380
Come again.

33:48.480 --> 33:50.959
It's just something my mom says.

34:02.093 --> 34:05.372
"Understanding Your Dreams."
That's a good book.

34:06.931 --> 34:10.368
- I get nightmares.
- So does my daughter.

34:10.868 --> 34:13.542
She has me sleep with her when she has 'em.

34:14.639 --> 34:16.641
Do you need anything else?

34:16.741 --> 34:19.016
No, thank you.

35:01.719 --> 35:03.330
Tess?

35:12.797 --> 35:14.345
Tess?

35:21.773 --> 35:23.786
Did you take your pill today?

35:27.011 --> 35:32.078
I know they don't make you feel good,
but doctors prescribe them for a reason.

35:32.178 --> 35:34.031
You know?

35:52.237 --> 35:54.505
<i>You knew there were gonna be side-effects.</i>

35:54.605 --> 35:56.407
No, I know.

35:56.507 --> 35:59.110
<i>That's better than the alternative, right?</i>

35:59.210 --> 36:01.346
I just wish she would talk to me.

36:01.446 --> 36:04.549
I mean, you have a better connection
with her and you're 10,000 miles away.

36:04.649 --> 36:06.601
<i>That's not true.</i>

36:06.721 --> 36:09.270
<i>You're being too hard on yourself.</i>

36:09.370 --> 36:13.691
<i>The way Tess is... who she is inside...</i>

36:13.791 --> 36:16.261
<i>...quiet, smart, thoughtful.</i>

36:17.161 --> 36:19.001
<i>She's just like you.</i>

38:47.779 --> 38:49.589
You have a stomachache?

38:52.183 --> 38:54.427
Let me get you some antacid, okay?

39:08.466 --> 39:11.103
Here. Tess. Take two of these, okay?

39:11.903 --> 39:13.747
You chew both of them?

39:51.743 --> 39:53.817
<i>It won't stop.</i>

40:00.651 --> 40:02.694
<i>I won't stop it.</i>

40:15.032 --> 40:16.849
<i>I won't stop.</i>

40:18.202 --> 40:20.009
<i>I won't stop.</i>

40:21.439 --> 40:23.253
<i>I won't stop.</i>

40:24.609 --> 40:26.452
<i>I won't stop.</i>

40:27.779 --> 40:29.582
<i>I won't stop.</i>

40:30.898 --> 40:32.741
<i>I won't stop.</i>

40:34.101 --> 40:35.958
<i>I won't stop.</i>

40:37.221 --> 40:39.028
<i>I won't stop.</i>

40:40.424 --> 40:42.231
<i>I won't stop.</i>

40:43.594 --> 40:45.437
<i>I won't stop.</i>

40:46.764 --> 40:48.578
<i>I won't stop.</i>

40:50.294 --> 40:52.141
<i>I won't stop.</i>

41:46.657 --> 41:50.319
It's not real. It's not real. It's not real.

41:50.419 --> 41:53.873
It's not real. It's not real. Not real.

42:20.892 --> 42:22.760
Go away!

42:23.260 --> 42:25.529
Leave me alone!

42:25.629 --> 42:27.741
Just go away!

42:27.841 --> 42:29.767
Go away!

42:29.867 --> 42:31.740
Go away!

43:09.606 --> 43:12.680
Please stop! Stop it!

43:13.778 --> 43:15.258
Please!

43:52.897 --> 43:54.360
Tess?

43:59.190 --> 44:01.459
Tess. Tess!

44:02.359 --> 44:03.931
Tess!

44:05.090 --> 44:06.605
Tess!

44:07.765 --> 44:09.308
Tess!

44:23.681 --> 44:25.955
Robert, she started cutting herself.

44:42.867 --> 44:45.741
<i>They're not gonna let me leave,
not even for this.</i>

46:02.113 --> 46:03.914
Don't worry.

46:04.014 --> 46:06.088
We'll get you more help.

46:10.955 --> 46:13.399
Why didn't you tell me you were in pain?

46:15.426 --> 46:17.233
You always tell me.

46:22.116 --> 46:24.810
Tess! Tess!

46:25.853 --> 46:27.463
Help!

48:09.506 --> 48:12.860
<i># It'll be here just in time ##</i>

48:55.119 --> 48:56.987
<i>Help me.</i>

48:57.087 --> 48:59.156
<i>Help me. Please help me.</i>

48:59.256 --> 49:02.612
- Hello?
- <i>Please. Mom...</i>

49:03.427 --> 49:04.925
<i>Mom, please help me.</i>

49:05.295 --> 49:07.798
- Hello?
- <i>Please help me, Mom.</i>

49:19.676 --> 49:21.930
<i>This is Lucy's phone.
I'm not here right now...</i>

49:22.030 --> 49:24.900
<i>...leave a message
and I might get back to you.</i>

49:33.757 --> 49:35.578
<i>Am I speaking with Tess?</i>

49:43.867 --> 49:46.313
Do you see that person over there?

49:50.774 --> 49:52.622
There's no one there.

49:57.714 --> 50:00.526
Let's take a look at the drawings
we asked you to do.

50:10.160 --> 50:13.030
You said you had a feeling
that something was pushing you down.

50:13.130 --> 50:14.969
You couldn't move.

50:19.469 --> 50:22.806
Did you know that there's a chemical
in your brain that makes you paralyzed...

50:22.906 --> 50:24.450
...when you sleep?

50:24.550 --> 50:26.954
It's so you don't get up while you dream.

50:28.579 --> 50:30.859
I wasn't sleeping.

50:31.848 --> 50:34.686
- Were you taking your medication?
- Yes.

50:35.586 --> 50:37.654
But it doesn't matter.

50:37.754 --> 50:39.723
They don't work anyway.

50:39.823 --> 50:41.826
With the hallucinations?

50:42.426 --> 50:44.228
The noises.

50:44.528 --> 50:46.342
What kind of noise?

51:01.245 --> 51:06.050
They think it's a severe case
of dissociative identity disorder.

51:06.850 --> 51:11.897
The doctors are suggesting I send her to
an institution where she can be supervised.

51:14.525 --> 51:16.799
You said she can move her limbs?

51:18.695 --> 51:21.146
They need more tests.

51:23.700 --> 51:25.578
Nothing's helped.

51:30.307 --> 51:32.242
Well, let me try.

51:32.842 --> 51:34.752
Do you believe in God?

51:37.614 --> 51:39.237
I don't know.

52:03.006 --> 52:07.044
- "Be strong in the Lord..."
- "And the power of his might.

52:07.144 --> 52:09.599
"Put on the whole armor of God...

52:09.699 --> 52:13.810
"...so that you may be able to stand
against the schemings of the devil.

52:13.910 --> 52:17.521
"For we do not rustle against
the flesh and the blood...

52:17.621 --> 52:20.167
"...or against the principalities
that powers...

52:20.267 --> 52:24.569
"...and against the spiritual host
in these heavenly places."

52:25.829 --> 52:28.044
That's not going to help.

52:33.987 --> 52:37.224
I talked to your little brother,
Steven, right?

52:37.324 --> 52:39.167
He looks about nine.

52:40.944 --> 52:44.626
Steven says he forgives you for what you did.

52:46.383 --> 52:48.393
<i>I miss you, Jeffrey.</i>

52:49.953 --> 52:51.501
What was that?

52:53.557 --> 52:55.430
I didn't say anything.

52:58.262 --> 52:59.990
You're not serious?

53:00.090 --> 53:04.646
Jessica, I want to help you in any way
I can, but I have no knowledge here.

53:06.970 --> 53:11.408
There's a seminary in St. Louis that
has experience with this sort of thing.

53:11.908 --> 53:15.729
I'd love for her to talk to someone there
if I can get them to see her...

53:15.829 --> 53:19.045
...but they'd have to meet her
outside of the hospital.

53:20.417 --> 53:24.092
They're making me talk to a social worker
before I can take her home.

53:27.224 --> 53:30.435
Well, maybe I can help
with that if they trust me here.

54:01.658 --> 54:03.501
Here you go.

54:11.968 --> 54:14.046
Are you taking me home?

55:11.595 --> 55:13.823
It's for your own safety.

55:48.365 --> 55:50.243
You have to eat.

55:52.903 --> 55:54.781
Doesn't matter.

57:03.773 --> 57:05.651
<i>I'll make 'em go away.</i>

57:12.148 --> 57:13.962
<i>What was that?</i>

57:40.276 --> 57:41.886
Tess!

57:45.748 --> 57:47.362
Tess!

57:48.652 --> 57:50.093
Tess!

59:32.288 --> 59:34.095
I'm home.

59:37.594 --> 59:41.631
<i>I traveled a lot when I was a kid.
My parents were missionaries, so we...</i>

59:42.131 --> 59:45.973
...traveled all over the world,
but India was our first stop.

59:48.138 --> 59:51.141
We'd only been there a few days
when I noticed all these people...

59:51.241 --> 59:53.877
...filing into the house across the street.

59:54.377 --> 59:56.780
So I snuck over...

59:57.480 --> 01:00:01.838
...and all the people were sitting
in the semicircle. And...

01:00:02.418 --> 01:00:05.089
<i>This woman was kneeling in the center...</i>

01:00:05.889 --> 01:00:08.616
<i>...swaying her head back and forth...</i>

01:00:10.226 --> 01:00:12.263
<i>Until something...</i>

01:00:13.063 --> 01:00:14.873
<i>...overtook her.</i>

01:00:21.905 --> 01:00:25.318
<i>She removed her hair from her face and...</i>

01:00:26.676 --> 01:00:28.879
<i>She kept staring until...</i>

01:00:29.179 --> 01:00:31.658
<i>...her eyes began to change colors.</i>

01:00:36.352 --> 01:00:39.155
<i>And they all raised their hands
wanting to speak to the woman...</i>

01:00:39.555 --> 01:00:42.721
<i>...actually speak to their dead
loved ones through her.</i>

01:00:47.363 --> 01:00:50.167
She would do this every month.

01:00:50.767 --> 01:00:53.735
<i>I would say they were taking
advantage of her, but...</i>

01:00:53.835 --> 01:00:57.107
<i>...I found out she willingly went through it.</i>

01:00:57.207 --> 01:01:01.078
<i>She considered it a gift to bring
the people in that room some peace...</i>

01:01:01.478 --> 01:01:04.482
<i>...and to convince the spirits
they could finally move on.</i>

01:01:05.582 --> 01:01:08.252
I think your daughter
may have the same gift...

01:01:08.952 --> 01:01:11.767
...and I think my daughter
is inside your daughter.

01:01:13.556 --> 01:01:16.960
Everything's that's happened to Tess
could be a result of this gift.

01:01:17.060 --> 01:01:19.117
Stop calling it that.

01:01:20.263 --> 01:01:21.838
Sorry.

01:01:23.500 --> 01:01:25.935
So what else makes you think this is real?

01:01:26.435 --> 01:01:29.840
She came into my store one day and
told me she had a necklace like this one.

01:01:29.940 --> 01:01:32.708
- She's had a lot of necklaces.
- And then she said a saying...

01:01:32.808 --> 01:01:35.745
...that I used to say to Lucy that she
hated that my mother always said to me...

01:01:35.845 --> 01:01:39.549
...that I'm sure when she grew up
she would probably say to her kids.

01:01:39.649 --> 01:01:41.618
What was it?

01:01:41.718 --> 01:01:44.526
"If your aunt had a mustache,
she'd be your uncle."

01:01:47.957 --> 01:01:50.593
Why would Tess have this?

01:01:50.693 --> 01:01:53.697
I think some people are just born with it.

01:01:54.297 --> 01:01:56.533
The Indian girl didn't ask why.

01:01:56.733 --> 01:02:00.170
She just accepted it
and dealt with it in her own way.

01:02:00.270 --> 01:02:04.412
I'm sorry. I can't just accept it.

01:02:06.075 --> 01:02:08.682
Maybe this is all too crazy to believe.

01:02:18.021 --> 01:02:19.564
Tess.

01:02:32.401 --> 01:02:34.470
Where's Dad?

01:02:36.170 --> 01:02:39.529
He left. It was really hard after.

01:02:40.209 --> 01:02:42.023
Can I talk to him?

01:02:43.780 --> 01:02:46.054
It's not a good idea, Lucy.

01:02:48.051 --> 01:02:50.379
He'll never believe this.

01:02:56.059 --> 01:03:00.503
That's Martha and Rena, Becka.

01:03:01.598 --> 01:03:03.874
My two cousins, Crystal and Lukas.

01:03:06.803 --> 01:03:08.571
And Pa Jeffrey.

01:03:08.871 --> 01:03:10.749
Is that right?

01:03:48.077 --> 01:03:50.191
What's in that locket?

01:03:52.615 --> 01:03:54.798
I never got a chance to put anything in it.

01:03:56.486 --> 01:03:59.934
My dad. He only gave it to me a week before.

01:04:01.457 --> 01:04:03.694
But if you need more proof.

01:04:04.494 --> 01:04:06.432
I'm sorry for doing this to her.

01:04:06.532 --> 01:04:08.964
I just wanted to be more like myself.

01:04:13.596 --> 01:04:16.444
Lucy's appendix burst
when she was eight years old.

01:04:24.530 --> 01:04:26.399
I'm not evil.

01:04:59.249 --> 01:05:02.528
<i>Just give me some time alone with her.</i>

01:05:03.619 --> 01:05:06.698
<i>She's just confused... stubborn.</i>

01:05:09.092 --> 01:05:11.294
<i>You want to be alone with her?</i>

01:05:11.394 --> 01:05:13.062
<i>For how long?</i>

01:05:13.162 --> 01:05:14.931
- <i>A few days.</i>
- <i>A few days?</i>

01:05:15.031 --> 01:05:16.933
<i>However long it takes.</i>

01:05:17.033 --> 01:05:21.938
<i>Look, I'll let you talk to her now,
with me in the room...</i>

01:05:22.038 --> 01:05:24.875
<i>...otherwise, I have to take her away.</i>

01:05:25.375 --> 01:05:27.181
<i>And what if she doesn't want to go?</i>

01:05:28.077 --> 01:05:29.880
Please let me stay.

01:05:30.680 --> 01:05:34.337
I worked so hard coming back to you.

01:05:41.657 --> 01:05:43.726
I don't want you to go.

01:05:43.826 --> 01:05:45.995
This isn't good for you.

01:05:46.095 --> 01:05:49.525
You're only gonna get more confused,
and then you'll never be able to move on.

01:05:49.625 --> 01:05:51.918
But I don't want to move on.

01:05:52.268 --> 01:05:55.909
It breaks my heart,
but it's the right thing to do.

01:05:56.739 --> 01:05:59.242
For Tess and there for you.

01:05:59.342 --> 01:06:02.862
- Please let her come back.
- She doesn't want to.

01:06:02.962 --> 01:06:05.681
The pills, the doctor's,
she's done with all of them.

01:06:05.781 --> 01:06:08.651
She's in a place where they can't hurt her.

01:06:08.851 --> 01:06:12.058
I'm sorry, but she doesn't trust you anymore.

01:06:12.158 --> 01:06:14.423
You have to move on, Lucinda.

01:06:14.523 --> 01:06:17.226
- I can't control it, Mom.
- I know you can.

01:06:17.326 --> 01:06:19.500
- I can't.
- Yes...

01:06:20.763 --> 01:06:22.131
...you can.

01:06:22.231 --> 01:06:26.069
Your other spirits... if I leave,
I may never be able to come back.

01:06:26.169 --> 01:06:28.012
Do you want that?

01:06:33.409 --> 01:06:35.423
You have to try.

01:06:37.113 --> 01:06:41.051
I'm so sorry for everything I said.
Just for everything.

01:06:41.551 --> 01:06:46.022
- I wish I wasn't such a little brat.
- No, no, no, don't... don't say that.

01:06:46.122 --> 01:06:49.090
I'd still be here with you and Dad
and you would still be together.

01:06:49.190 --> 01:06:51.999
- It's not your fault.
- Yes, it is.

01:06:56.465 --> 01:06:59.303
I just want you to be at peace, Lucy...

01:07:00.803 --> 01:07:03.047
...and to be in a better place.

01:07:06.008 --> 01:07:07.556
Okay.

01:07:19.755 --> 01:07:21.562
What's going on?

01:07:25.428 --> 01:07:28.873
- I love you, Mom.
- I love you, too.

01:07:33.669 --> 01:07:35.473
Is that Tess?

01:07:37.473 --> 01:07:38.758
I'm not sure.

01:07:38.858 --> 01:07:41.660
You have to try harder, Lucy. Is that Tess?

01:08:00.579 --> 01:08:03.049
- What's going on?
- I don't know!

01:08:15.061 --> 01:08:16.399
Tess?

01:08:17.630 --> 01:08:19.143
Tess.

01:08:20.866 --> 01:08:22.872
- Tess?
- Just stop that.

01:08:50.595 --> 01:08:52.674
What is she saying?

01:08:54.700 --> 01:08:56.270
I can't tell.

01:09:28.401 --> 01:09:29.910
Tess?

01:09:39.145 --> 01:09:40.787
Lucy?

01:10:30.630 --> 01:10:32.444
Who are you?

01:10:45.060 --> 01:10:46.464
Tess!

01:10:49.582 --> 01:10:51.121
Tess!

01:10:58.757 --> 01:11:02.029
- Tess! Stop!
- It's okay. There's no way out down there!

01:11:03.329 --> 01:11:04.976
No!

01:11:46.706 --> 01:11:49.752
- What are you doing?
- She might be hurt.

01:11:51.877 --> 01:11:53.536
She's my daughter.

01:13:12.124 --> 01:13:14.726
Tess! Tess!

01:13:15.426 --> 01:13:17.464
Please come out!

01:13:19.364 --> 01:13:21.858
Please come out!

01:13:22.868 --> 01:13:24.889
I'll keep you safe.

01:13:26.438 --> 01:13:30.676
I'm begging you! I'm begging you!
I'll do better! I swear.

01:13:30.776 --> 01:13:32.986
I just need you back.

01:13:48.994 --> 01:13:50.437
Tess?

01:14:19.058 --> 01:14:20.864
Where's my mom?

01:14:22.795 --> 01:14:24.797
<i>Lucy's a strong soul.</i>

01:14:24.897 --> 01:14:27.712
<i>That's why she was able
to fight her way back.</i>

01:14:29.034 --> 01:14:30.677
Maybe...

01:14:32.638 --> 01:14:34.687
...she just needs closure.

01:14:37.977 --> 01:14:42.406
I don't know, but isn't that...
what they all want?

01:14:43.783 --> 01:14:46.427
I think they just don't want to leave.

01:15:39.271 --> 01:15:41.085
Morgan's gone.

01:15:52.518 --> 01:15:54.361
She'll come back.

01:15:56.488 --> 01:15:58.937
Everyone's trying to move on.

01:16:03.062 --> 01:16:05.063
Even you?

01:16:20.779 --> 01:16:22.215
Tess?

01:16:22.815 --> 01:16:25.083
- Lucy.
- Tess.

01:16:27.151 --> 01:16:29.589
Baby, it's only gonna get worse.

01:16:31.089 --> 01:16:32.899
Trust me, please?

01:16:40.933 --> 01:16:43.111
Can I just have one more night?

01:16:47.246 --> 01:16:48.870
Sure.

01:17:27.212 --> 01:17:28.755
Hi.

01:19:45.887 --> 01:19:47.481
<i>Lucy?</i>

01:19:50.388 --> 01:19:52.396
<i>Do you really want to go back?</i>

01:19:55.193 --> 01:19:57.466
<i>I'll tell your mom you're not sure.</i>

01:20:47.346 --> 01:20:48.769
Lucy?

01:21:07.599 --> 01:21:09.477
I came back for you, Mom.

01:21:12.271 --> 01:21:14.149
I won't leave you again.

01:21:26.198 --> 01:21:27.761
Wait.

01:22:50.469 --> 01:22:53.272
We can move back if you want.

01:22:56.408 --> 01:22:58.623
Whatever you think is best.

01:23:01.213 --> 01:23:03.428
I'll do better for you.

01:23:05.250 --> 01:23:07.099
I know you will.

01:23:49.861 --> 01:23:51.709
Let me see.

01:23:55.600 --> 01:23:58.037
You got to keep building up your calluses.

01:23:59.237 --> 01:24:01.047
Keep playing, okay?

01:24:02.541 --> 01:24:04.413
I will.

01:24:05.260 --> 01:24:07.543
Promise me you won't give up.

01:24:09.331 --> 01:24:11.147
I promise.

01:24:12.350 --> 01:24:14.553
She seems better to you, right?

01:24:15.153 --> 01:24:16.921
You don't think so?

01:24:17.021 --> 01:24:19.658
I don't... I just don't know anymore.

01:24:20.358 --> 01:24:22.572
She can be a normal kid again.

01:24:23.528 --> 01:24:25.171
Can be even cool.

01:25:07.939 --> 01:25:11.993
<i># You and I are together #</i>

01:25:12.393 --> 01:25:16.435
<i># You're the jewel in my crown #</i>

01:25:17.949 --> 01:25:22.187
<i># So it will be forever #</i>

01:25:22.287 --> 01:25:26.303
<i># What goes up must come down #</i>

01:25:29.694 --> 01:25:34.599
<i># You go north, till it's south #</i>

01:25:34.699 --> 01:25:38.179
<i># You'd come back around #</i>

01:25:42.107 --> 01:25:46.344
<i># I could never, ever leave you #</i>

01:25:46.444 --> 01:25:50.058
<i># No matter if I tried #</i>

01:25:51.850 --> 01:25:56.221
<i># And if you'd ever run, I'd retrieve you #</i>

01:25:56.321 --> 01:26:00.197
<i># To keep you satisfied #</i>

01:26:03.995 --> 01:26:06.244
You know, I never did get your name.

01:26:48.119 --> 01:26:50.475
<i># As you can run #</i>

01:26:50.575 --> 01:26:52.978
<i># You can hide #</i>

01:26:53.366 --> 01:26:57.038
<i># Love you till I die ##</i>
