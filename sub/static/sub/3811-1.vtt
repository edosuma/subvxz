Come on.

00:25.492 --> 00:27.259
Hold on.
Hold on. Wait.

00:27.261 --> 00:28.427
What?
Wait.

00:28.429 --> 00:30.029
What's the matter, baby?
Hold on.

00:30.031 --> 00:31.697
Just need another hit.
Come on.

00:33.099 --> 00:34.166
Here.

00:50.785 --> 00:52.351
Good, huh?

00:58.592 --> 01:00.392
What's up?

01:02.630 --> 01:04.096
What the fuck?

01:04.098 --> 01:05.597
What's wrong?

01:05.599 --> 01:06.732
Get off.
What the...

01:06.734 --> 01:08.267
what the fuck?!

01:13.640 --> 01:15.174
Fucking crackheads.

01:21.481 --> 01:22.748
Hey.

01:25.586 --> 01:26.652
Come on.

01:29.789 --> 01:31.523
Let's see.

01:34.427 --> 01:35.427
Oh, fuck.

01:37.698 --> 01:39.231
Sorry, baby.

02:04.825 --> 02:05.824
Hello.

02:05.826 --> 02:07.593
Shh.

02:09.162 --> 02:10.895
Please take me off your list.

02:10.898 --> 02:12.664
I don't want...

02:13.633 --> 02:16.535
Oh.
Hi, Mr. Hamilton.

02:22.809 --> 02:23.876
Is he ok?

02:26.279 --> 02:28.280
No, of course not, sir.
I'M glad to do IT.

02:30.717 --> 02:32.751
Thank you. I will.

02:35.555 --> 02:37.823
I have to go
to San Diego today.

02:37.825 --> 02:38.891
What?

02:38.893 --> 02:41.493
Alex Hamilton is
in the hospital.

02:41.495 --> 02:43.529
He's the one WHO got drunk

02:43.531 --> 02:44.796
at our WEDDING.
Yeah.

02:44.798 --> 02:47.166
Swam in the fountain, no pants.
Yes.

02:47.168 --> 02:48.167
Unnecessarily handsome.

02:48.169 --> 02:49.234
Yeah.

02:51.471 --> 02:53.739
He had some kind of accident.

02:53.741 --> 02:55.741
That was his father.

02:55.743 --> 02:57.876
You couldn't say no?

02:57.878 --> 03:00.512
First time he's ever asked
me to do anything for him?

03:00.514 --> 03:01.647
No, I can't say no.

03:01.649 --> 03:03.448
Well...

03:03.450 --> 03:05.484
What about
our appointment, then?

03:05.486 --> 03:07.786
Ok, obviously
I can't make IT anymore.

03:07.788 --> 03:09.454
Fine.

03:09.456 --> 03:11.390
I'll be at my parents
when you get back, then.

03:11.392 --> 03:12.624
Listen, you can
go to this thing

03:12.626 --> 03:13.792
on your own. You don't need...
great.

03:13.794 --> 03:15.194
Do whatever you want.

03:15.196 --> 03:16.929
My friend is in the
hospital, Shireen.

03:16.931 --> 03:20.265
I just have to bring him home.
I have to do this.

03:20.267 --> 03:23.302
Your priorities
are all wrong, Reza.

03:31.411 --> 03:32.778
Shireen.

03:34.247 --> 03:36.415
I'll be home tonight!

04:51.025 --> 04:52.691
Fuck you.

05:56.757 --> 05:57.956
Reza.

05:57.958 --> 05:59.091
Dude.
Hey.

05:59.093 --> 06:00.926
Nice to see you.
You look cool.

06:02.362 --> 06:03.628
Thanks.

06:03.630 --> 06:05.997
Yeah, this is a nice
ride you got here.

06:05.999 --> 06:09.901
Thanks. It's just part of the
business upgrade, not a big deal.

06:09.903 --> 06:12.504
I like with the whole, um...

06:13.740 --> 06:15.907
He's not
at the hospital anymore.

06:15.909 --> 06:16.908
Why?

06:16.910 --> 06:18.643
I don't know, dude.

06:18.645 --> 06:19.878
He checked out.

06:19.880 --> 06:21.613
I talked to the hospital,

06:21.615 --> 06:24.916
and, uh, his voice mail
is completely full.

06:26.720 --> 06:28.019
Shit.

06:28.021 --> 06:29.454
Shit.

06:37.964 --> 06:40.799
Ah, just check out
some of these places, man.

06:40.801 --> 06:43.902
Yeah, when your dad pays
the rent, sky's the limit.

06:43.904 --> 06:45.003
All right.

06:59.118 --> 07:00.752
Yeah.

07:02.722 --> 07:03.722
There we go.

07:03.724 --> 07:05.590
What, we going to the gym?

07:06.726 --> 07:08.727
This is my airplane
travel outfit.

07:08.729 --> 07:09.728
It's for comfort.

07:09.730 --> 07:11.430
Yeah?

07:11.432 --> 07:13.465
Look like 1998 puff daddy.

07:13.467 --> 07:14.933
That was his best period.

07:14.935 --> 07:16.802
I'll take that as a compliment.

07:16.804 --> 07:18.570
Heh.

07:27.180 --> 07:28.180
Alex!

07:28.182 --> 07:30.148
This place is a mess.

07:30.150 --> 07:32.517
Listen, what IF he doesn't
want to come with us?

07:32.519 --> 07:34.119
Have you thought about that?

07:34.121 --> 07:36.655
He has no choice. His dad's
gonna cut him off for good.

07:36.657 --> 07:38.156
Yeah, what IF he doesn't care?

07:38.158 --> 07:40.058
Listen, I have an obligation
to the man, ok?

07:40.060 --> 07:41.660
He helped me
get my scholarship,

07:41.662 --> 07:43.662
and when someone like that
asks you to do something,

07:43.664 --> 07:45.730
you do IT.
You don't question IT.

07:48.468 --> 07:49.601
Alex!

07:49.603 --> 07:51.169
It's Reza!

07:54.707 --> 07:55.774
What was that?

08:01.547 --> 08:03.081
I don't hear IT anymore.

08:03.083 --> 08:04.082
Shh!

08:11.157 --> 08:13.024
Human legs.

08:14.894 --> 08:15.961
Alex?

08:17.497 --> 08:18.864
Hey, Alex.

08:20.501 --> 08:21.566
Hey.

08:21.568 --> 08:22.634
Alex.

08:30.610 --> 08:33.078
What the fuck?
Yeah.

08:33.080 --> 08:35.212
You guys scared
the fuck out of me!

08:44.190 --> 08:46.591
What the fuck are you
guys doing down here?

08:46.593 --> 08:48.093
This is crazy.

08:48.095 --> 08:49.160
Yeah.

08:49.162 --> 08:51.029
Oh, hugs. Hugs.

08:51.031 --> 08:52.063
Ah, man

08:52.065 --> 08:53.832
that's good.

08:53.834 --> 08:55.166
So next thing you know, I'M
in a fucking ambulance

08:55.168 --> 08:56.935
being rushed to the hospital.

08:56.937 --> 08:58.904
They checked me out. I sign
the papers and catch a cab.

08:58.906 --> 09:00.572
You guys care
for an eye-opener?

09:00.574 --> 09:01.840
Well, I'M confused.
WHO are these people?

09:01.842 --> 09:04.609
Ah, just some punks, bro.

09:04.611 --> 09:06.945
Why do they want to hurt you?

09:06.947 --> 09:08.947
IT just looks bad.
It's nothing, really.

09:13.019 --> 09:14.586
Ah, wow.

09:14.588 --> 09:15.987
What a night!

09:15.989 --> 09:16.988
Whoo!

09:18.325 --> 09:21.026
So what are you guys
doing in San Diego, anyway?

09:21.028 --> 09:22.661
Huh?

09:25.064 --> 09:26.197
Hmm?

09:30.836 --> 09:31.970
Yeah.

09:44.250 --> 09:46.251
So let me see IF I
fully understand this.

09:46.253 --> 09:49.321
You guys came down here

09:49.323 --> 09:51.356
to bring me back up
to San Francisco

09:51.358 --> 09:55.060
'cause my dad Says that
he wants me back home?

09:56.362 --> 09:59.130
Yeah.
That about covers IT.

10:00.333 --> 10:02.300
This a...

10:02.302 --> 10:04.903
Intervention or something?

10:04.905 --> 10:06.738
Did he pay you?

10:07.873 --> 10:10.842
Alex, whatever
IT is you're into,

10:10.844 --> 10:13.311
you gotta get out of IT now.

10:13.313 --> 10:15.647
What about my job?

10:15.649 --> 10:16.781
The paralegal?
Dude, your dad

10:16.783 --> 10:18.883
can find you a new job
in 10 minutes.

10:18.885 --> 10:19.884
There you go.

10:19.886 --> 10:21.219
You've been to that house.

10:21.221 --> 10:22.354
I can't live there.

10:22.356 --> 10:23.655
Ah, come on, man.

10:23.657 --> 10:24.789
Laundry's always done for you.

10:24.791 --> 10:25.890
Fridge is always full.

10:25.892 --> 10:27.258
Nobody's ever there.
I mean,

10:27.260 --> 10:29.194
You'll basically have
the place to yourself.

10:29.196 --> 10:30.195
It's got that fountain.

10:30.197 --> 10:31.663
It's got the fountain.

10:31.665 --> 10:33.298
Plus, look at this place.

10:33.300 --> 10:35.734
Looks like you've been eating
cheese fries off the table.

10:35.736 --> 10:37.369
You shouldn't be eating
cheese fries at all.

10:37.371 --> 10:39.237
I mean, I'd say
It's time to go.

10:40.640 --> 10:43.074
There's, like, funyuns
in that wineglass.

10:43.076 --> 10:44.743
Funyuns and wine

10:44.745 --> 10:47.045
and cigarettes.

10:57.356 --> 10:58.757
Fuck IT.

10:58.759 --> 11:00.091
Yes!

11:00.093 --> 11:01.926
Ah, see?
All right. Ok.

11:01.928 --> 11:03.061
Well, let's pack your bags

11:03.063 --> 11:04.429
and get the 6:30 flight
out of here.

11:04.431 --> 11:05.964
Oh, I'M not leaving
without all my stuff.

11:05.966 --> 11:07.065
What do you mean?

11:07.067 --> 11:09.100
What do you mean,
what do I mean?

11:09.102 --> 11:10.935
All of my stuff.
I'M not kidding.

11:10.937 --> 11:13.371
What? Dude, what do you
have that's so important?

11:13.373 --> 11:16.241
Guy, I'M not even
gonna answer that.

11:16.243 --> 11:18.243
What? My whole life
is here.

11:18.245 --> 11:19.444
What are you talking about?

11:19.446 --> 11:21.179
We don't have time
for that. Sorry.

11:21.181 --> 11:23.348
No time?
Mm-mmm.

11:23.350 --> 11:24.883
All I have is time, bro.

11:24.885 --> 11:27.052
Nobody's keeping you here.

11:28.354 --> 11:30.155
Fucking shit.
All right.

11:30.157 --> 11:32.290
Well, let's see what we can
pack in your stupid car.

11:32.292 --> 11:34.059
I don't have my car, remember?

11:34.061 --> 11:36.828
Listen, we're gonna need a
truck for all this, anyway.

11:36.830 --> 11:38.897
What? No. We're not
getting a truck.

11:38.899 --> 11:41.066
IF we're gonna get IT all,
we're gonna need a truck, Rez.

11:41.068 --> 11:42.400
There's no way
we're getting a truck.

11:42.402 --> 11:43.435
We did not discuss this.

11:43.437 --> 11:45.136
We're gonna need a truck.

12:00.853 --> 12:02.320
Fuck.

12:02.322 --> 12:05.323
Dude, what's going on?

12:05.325 --> 12:06.825
I'M sorry.
This fell.

12:06.827 --> 12:08.293
Ow.

12:08.295 --> 12:09.294
Sorry, man.

12:09.296 --> 12:10.395
It's all good.

12:10.397 --> 12:12.230
Hey, listen.
What do you want to do

12:12.232 --> 12:13.331
with all this stuff here?

12:13.333 --> 12:14.799
What?

12:14.801 --> 12:16.301
This junk right here.

12:16.303 --> 12:17.769
This?

12:17.771 --> 12:19.037
Yeah.

12:19.039 --> 12:21.873
Dude, this is, like,
a $500 freshwater tank.

12:21.875 --> 12:24.209
My Japanese fighting
fish Shakiro's in there.

12:24.211 --> 12:25.977
I just gotta clean IT, man.

12:25.979 --> 12:28.012
There's a fish in there?
Yeah.

12:29.249 --> 12:31.349
Yeah, he's right here.

12:31.351 --> 12:35.019
What do you want to do with this gay
sex paddle that you got in here?

12:35.021 --> 12:37.088
It's my pledge paddle.
Where'd you find this?

12:37.090 --> 12:39.023
Under all the rest
of this shit.

12:39.025 --> 12:41.793
Hey, guys, I think I caught an s.T.D.
On my safari.

12:41.795 --> 12:42.861
It's itchy.

12:44.530 --> 12:48.399
Dude, this is from my bike
trip in South America.

12:48.401 --> 12:50.034
Be careful with IT.

12:51.937 --> 12:53.471
Nothing's garbage in here, ok,

12:53.473 --> 12:55.039
unless I say IT is.

12:55.041 --> 12:56.441
Of course.

12:58.043 --> 13:00.111
IF you guys want
to leave, just leave.

13:00.113 --> 13:01.246
You know, fucking leave.

13:01.248 --> 13:03.548
IF you guys wanna
go home, go home.

13:03.550 --> 13:05.150
Get the fuck out of here, then.

13:05.152 --> 13:06.484
IF you guys wanna leave, leave!

13:06.486 --> 13:08.520
I didn't ask you
to come here, ok?!

13:08.522 --> 13:11.556
What, you're fucking saving me?
What the fuck?

13:11.558 --> 13:12.857
Huh? What the fuck?

13:12.859 --> 13:14.325
You...

13:22.903 --> 13:24.302
Look at you guys.

13:24.304 --> 13:26.004
You're so serious.

13:26.006 --> 13:27.405
You're just moving me.

13:30.242 --> 13:31.976
Let's get out of here.

13:31.978 --> 13:33.511
We're having a good time.

13:33.513 --> 13:34.579
Good, man.

13:36.015 --> 13:37.248
Fuck.

13:38.484 --> 13:40.819
You can't help?

13:51.831 --> 13:55.133
Why does he have
so many vhs tapes?

13:55.135 --> 13:58.937
"Lionel Richie,
live in concert."

14:07.279 --> 14:09.347
I thought I'd see you
at the 10-year.

14:09.349 --> 14:11.216
The reunion?

14:11.218 --> 14:13.551
Yeah. I thought you'd play
with your band or something.

14:13.553 --> 14:15.453
Why would you
think that? Seriously?

14:19.325 --> 14:21.025
There's no band anymore anyway.

14:21.027 --> 14:23.561
You know what? I heard that.
So It's true, huh?

14:25.297 --> 14:28.066
That's too bad.

14:28.068 --> 14:30.101
So what are you
up to these days?

14:30.103 --> 14:31.369
Do real estate, actually.

14:31.371 --> 14:33.004
Real estate?

14:33.006 --> 14:35.006
Why is that funny?

14:35.008 --> 14:36.875
Sorry. I thought
you were joking.

14:36.877 --> 14:39.911
I just never saw you
as the salesperson type,

14:39.913 --> 14:41.412
you know what I mean?

14:41.414 --> 14:43.281
Thanks.

14:57.464 --> 14:58.963
Hi, Shireen.

14:58.965 --> 15:00.198
Where are you?

15:00.200 --> 15:01.466
Alex's place.

15:01.468 --> 15:03.468
You said you'd be home tonight.

15:03.470 --> 15:07.438
Yeah, I know I did, but we actually
never were able to get to the airport.

15:07.440 --> 15:08.573
Why not?

15:08.575 --> 15:10.041
We're leaving tomorrow morning.

15:10.043 --> 15:11.242
What?
In a truck.

15:11.244 --> 15:12.644
Truck?
Yeah, moving truck. Yeah.

15:12.646 --> 15:13.645
IT doesn't matter.

15:13.647 --> 15:15.380
I went to my parents'.

15:15.382 --> 15:17.282
You did?
Yes.

15:17.284 --> 15:19.651
Ok, can we talk
about this later?

15:19.653 --> 15:22.220
And then, right when
we least expect IT,

15:22.222 --> 15:24.322
boom, limited-edition
signed prints for everyone.

15:24.324 --> 15:26.124
Dude hangs out all night,

15:26.126 --> 15:28.927
just like the most down-to-earth
guy in the world, you know.

15:28.929 --> 15:31.296
You would never know he was a
multiplatinum recording artist.

15:31.298 --> 15:34.399
Nice. So you get to hang out at
these industry parties a lot?

15:34.401 --> 15:36.434
Yeah, dude, all the time.

15:36.436 --> 15:38.036
Amusica hooks up the invites.

15:38.038 --> 15:39.971
I go to all the awards
shows, you know,

15:39.973 --> 15:41.673
like vh1, mtv, the grammys.

15:41.675 --> 15:43.408
I mean, I go when I can.

15:43.410 --> 15:45.176
I'M just, like,
so busy these days

15:45.178 --> 15:47.478
that IT gets sort of hard
to make IT all the time.

15:47.480 --> 15:48.947
WHO else have you met?

15:48.949 --> 15:50.048
Ok... you know what? Seriously,

15:50.050 --> 15:51.482
can we talk about
something else,

15:51.484 --> 15:53.351
anything else, please?
Oh, I thought...

15:53.353 --> 15:55.019
I thought you'd
appreciate this.

15:55.021 --> 15:57.088
I don't know why
you'd think that.

15:57.090 --> 15:59.257
Well, 'cause you want
to be in the music industry.

15:59.259 --> 16:02.493
Yeah, but you're not really
in the music business, right?

16:02.495 --> 16:05.296
I mean, you work p.R. For,
like, a tech company, yeah?

16:05.298 --> 16:07.398
That distributes music
and allows you

16:07.400 --> 16:10.134
to discover IT and
share IT with friends.

16:10.136 --> 16:11.135
Right?

16:11.137 --> 16:12.370
Pass the Kung Pao.

16:12.372 --> 16:14.505
Here.
And for the record,

16:14.507 --> 16:16.441
I don't want to be in
the music business.

16:16.443 --> 16:19.310
Right. Well, maybe Alex
wants to hear these stories.

16:19.312 --> 16:20.511
You ever consider that?

16:20.513 --> 16:21.713
Buddy, I promise you

16:21.715 --> 16:24.148
nobody wants to hear
your cheesy stories

16:24.150 --> 16:25.616
about Hollywood parties
and star-fuckers.

16:25.618 --> 16:27.018
I'M serious.

16:27.020 --> 16:28.252
Dude, everyone wants
to hear my stories.

16:28.254 --> 16:29.287
My stories rock.

16:29.289 --> 16:30.355
You're just jealous.

16:30.357 --> 16:31.656
Jealous of what?

16:33.025 --> 16:35.460
You know, I took
the road less traveled.

16:39.298 --> 16:41.332
"You are on the path
to enlightenment."

16:41.334 --> 16:43.534
Accurate.
What's yours?

16:43.536 --> 16:45.436
"You're gonna die alone
in a nursing home."

16:45.438 --> 16:47.572
IT doesn't say that.
What's yours?

16:49.174 --> 16:51.776
You know what?
I don't give a fuck.

16:53.379 --> 16:55.179
That's bad luck.

17:21.573 --> 17:23.407
Hey, check IT out, dude.

17:23.410 --> 17:26.277
I am Daenerys Targaryen. I need
ships to cross the narrow sea.

17:26.279 --> 17:27.612
I am your Kaleesi.

17:27.614 --> 17:29.047
What?

17:29.049 --> 17:30.314
"Game of thrones," dude.

17:30.316 --> 17:31.416
Hey, Alex!

17:31.418 --> 17:33.217
We're finished here!
Come on!

17:36.722 --> 17:38.122
What's your...

17:38.124 --> 17:39.157
It's fucking awesome.

17:39.159 --> 17:40.658
It's got intrigue, boobs.

17:49.268 --> 17:50.701
Yeah, he's ok.

17:50.703 --> 17:53.071
Like, he used to be
more bad-ass.

17:53.073 --> 17:54.439
Oh. Hey, you ready?

17:55.841 --> 17:57.575
Was born ready, amigo.

17:57.577 --> 17:59.277
Let's go, then.
Come on.

17:59.279 --> 18:01.712
Have you seen
"game of thrones"?

18:13.359 --> 18:15.626
They found IT on his
fucking computer screen.

18:15.628 --> 18:16.627
Yeah, they did.

18:16.629 --> 18:17.628
Derek Lao?
Yeah.

18:17.630 --> 18:19.097
From chemistry?
Yeah.

18:19.099 --> 18:20.231
He was my...

18:20.233 --> 18:21.833
my chemistry partner
in ninth grade.

18:21.835 --> 18:23.301
Yeah?
Convicted pedophile.

18:23.303 --> 18:24.368
We had to pull him off of you.

18:24.370 --> 18:25.470
I forgot.
He kicked your ass.

18:25.472 --> 18:26.571
Ok. Ok,
no, he did not.

18:26.573 --> 18:27.872
We had to pull him off you.

18:32.444 --> 18:34.612
No, he did not.
He pushed me.

18:34.614 --> 18:35.613
Shoelaces were untied.

18:35.615 --> 18:37.115
Crack in the sidewalk.

18:37.117 --> 18:38.816
I fall. That's
what happened.

18:43.188 --> 18:44.188
I WAS a fucking superhero.

18:44.190 --> 18:45.289
I fought a pedophile.

18:45.291 --> 18:46.691
What have you done
with your lives?

18:46.693 --> 18:48.693
I took on a pedophile.
You cheered him on.

18:48.695 --> 18:49.861
He's a creepshow, man.

18:49.863 --> 18:51.696
Oh, my God.
He really was.

18:51.698 --> 18:53.464
Oh, listen to this.

19:02.509 --> 19:04.642
It's your song!

19:04.644 --> 19:05.910
Whoa! Easy.
Bro, It's you!

19:05.912 --> 19:07.345
Easy!
I'M driving!

19:08.548 --> 19:10.181
That's fucking crazy!

19:16.689 --> 19:17.922
Calm down, dude.

19:17.924 --> 19:20.158
Shit.
Ah...

19:20.160 --> 19:22.927
Are you still seeing
checks for this thing?

19:27.633 --> 19:29.767
What's up with you, guy?

19:29.769 --> 19:32.403
I'M not really in the mood
for music right now.

19:32.405 --> 19:33.671
That's what up with me.

19:40.379 --> 19:41.646
You gonna eat anything?

19:41.648 --> 19:44.382
Yeah, I won't put
that shit in my body.

19:44.384 --> 19:46.651
You know It's
all taints, right?

19:46.653 --> 19:50.521
You're basically sucking on
a cow's asshole right now.

19:50.523 --> 19:52.557
It's actually healthier
to blow a bulldog.

19:52.559 --> 19:53.891
At least You'll
get some protein

19:53.893 --> 19:56.227
at the end of IT
IF you do IT right.

19:56.229 --> 19:58.663
There's, like,
a worm in there. I saw...

19:58.665 --> 20:00.264
ah, jeez, no!

20:45.477 --> 20:47.011
What's taking him so long?

20:49.248 --> 20:50.248
I don't know.

20:53.453 --> 20:54.719
Shh.

20:54.721 --> 20:56.487
WHO is IT?
Shh.

20:56.489 --> 20:58.656
Hi, Mr. Hamilton.

20:58.658 --> 21:00.958
Yes, I am.

21:00.960 --> 21:03.294
He's doing well, actually.

21:05.464 --> 21:07.298
Treatment facility?

21:08.033 --> 21:09.900
Wait.
Where the hell is he?

21:09.902 --> 21:10.968
Shh. Of course.

21:12.371 --> 21:13.471
Thank you.

21:14.606 --> 21:16.574
A treatment facility?

21:16.576 --> 21:18.042
Yeah, serenity woods.

21:18.044 --> 21:19.477
You've gotta be kidding me.

21:19.479 --> 21:20.711
Serenity woods,
that sounds very peaceful.

21:20.713 --> 21:22.413
What, we're just supposed

21:22.415 --> 21:24.448
to drop him off there
and say good-bye?

21:24.450 --> 21:25.850
"Oh, see you, man."

21:25.852 --> 21:27.518
Jesus, dude.
What an asshole.

21:27.520 --> 21:29.487
You can't just make
somebody go to treatment.

21:29.489 --> 21:32.356
They gotta want to. They
gotta be willing to do IT.

21:32.358 --> 21:33.991
Kid just needs a break,
that's all.

21:33.993 --> 21:35.893
Listen, let's just
get back on the road,

21:35.895 --> 21:37.795
and please don't say
anything to him, ok?

21:37.797 --> 21:39.697
How are we not
gonna say anything?

21:39.699 --> 21:41.799
I don't know.
We're just not gonna...

21:43.035 --> 21:44.035
hey, dude.

21:44.037 --> 21:46.003
Hey, man.

21:46.005 --> 21:47.872
Hey.

21:47.874 --> 21:49.907
WHO were you guys talking to?

21:49.909 --> 21:51.309
My wife.

22:02.321 --> 22:03.721
Need to make a stop.

22:03.723 --> 22:06.090
We don't have time
to make any stops.

22:06.092 --> 22:07.992
We don't?

22:07.994 --> 22:10.394
Are you in a rush?

22:14.333 --> 22:16.367
What? Where do
you need to go?

22:16.369 --> 22:18.602
I gotta go to west Covina.

22:18.604 --> 22:19.970
I have some business.

22:19.972 --> 22:22.606
Oh, yeah? What
business do you have?

22:23.775 --> 22:25.776
Don't worry about IT, guy.

22:25.778 --> 22:28.512
I have a trip to napa planned
with Shireen, all right?

22:28.514 --> 22:29.680
It's for our anniversary.

22:29.682 --> 22:30.848
We've already
bought the tickets.

22:30.850 --> 22:32.483
All the scheduling is in place.

22:32.485 --> 22:33.517
We're leaving tonight.

22:33.519 --> 22:35.720
This is why I need to be home.

22:38.423 --> 22:39.557
Won't take long.

22:39.559 --> 22:41.359
We're not stopping.

23:15.494 --> 23:18.028
I love IT when the
fucking gas station

23:18.030 --> 23:20.464
is nowhere near
the fucking exit.

23:20.466 --> 23:22.133
It's fucking lies.

23:22.135 --> 23:25.102
That road sign lied.

23:25.104 --> 23:26.837
Should say, "I'M a liar.

23:26.839 --> 23:28.806
Next stop, eh."

23:28.808 --> 23:31.642
There's, like,
no bars, this whole place.

23:31.644 --> 23:33.911
Ok, honey,
you need to calm down

23:33.913 --> 23:35.646
and stay put until
I get there, ok?

23:35.648 --> 23:36.947
You can't keep
jerking me around

23:36.949 --> 23:38.816
every time you change
you mind, all right?

23:38.818 --> 23:40.518
Fine. I'M just gonna go, then.
No, no, no.

23:40.520 --> 23:41.719
I am going.
Don't hang up, honey.

23:41.721 --> 23:42.720
Please don't hang up.
No.

23:42.722 --> 23:43.888
God damn...

23:48.660 --> 23:51.061
I mean, you remember
how he could get sometimes.

23:51.063 --> 23:53.998
You know, he really
doesn't mean to be a tool.

23:54.000 --> 23:55.900
He just can't seem
to help himself.

23:55.902 --> 23:57.001
Though I have to say,

23:57.003 --> 23:58.669
It's worse then I remember.

24:00.806 --> 24:02.106
Yeah.

24:03.542 --> 24:04.742
Yo, guy, you want to, uh...

24:04.744 --> 24:06.544
want to get me
some snacks inside

24:06.546 --> 24:08.145
while I fill this puppy up?

24:08.147 --> 24:09.914
Yeah. You know what? I'M gonna
get some cigarettes anyway.

24:09.916 --> 24:10.915
What do you want?

24:10.917 --> 24:12.850
Uh, something salty.

24:12.852 --> 24:13.851
Yeah. All right.

24:13.853 --> 24:15.519
Yo, and get me a, um,

24:15.521 --> 24:17.087
sixer IF you can, too.

24:56.027 --> 24:58.929
These ingredients lists
are insane.

24:58.931 --> 25:00.865
They look like names of demons.

25:00.867 --> 25:03.667
Thiamine mononitrate,
evil lord of plastic.

25:03.669 --> 25:04.768
You ok?

25:04.770 --> 25:06.270
Yeah, I'M fine.

25:06.272 --> 25:09.039
I just need to get home.

25:09.041 --> 25:11.909
Guess you're used to missing
events all the time.

25:11.911 --> 25:13.143
What?

25:13.145 --> 25:15.145
You know, just missing
important occasions

25:15.147 --> 25:17.781
isn't such a big deal
for you, that's all.

25:17.783 --> 25:19.550
What the fuck
you talking about?

25:19.552 --> 25:21.919
You know, 'cause of all
the shows you had.

25:24.789 --> 25:26.190
My WEDDING.

25:26.192 --> 25:28.792
Jeez. Wh... I didn't
send you a gift? What?

25:28.794 --> 25:30.661
I fought to get you an invite,

25:30.663 --> 25:32.196
never even heard back.

25:32.198 --> 25:35.099
I don't think I actually
got one, so I'M sorry.

25:35.101 --> 25:37.101
I tracked the package
all the way to your house.

25:37.103 --> 25:39.670
So how is the, uh, ice
princess these days, anyway?

25:39.672 --> 25:42.573
Still transparent and
condescending, I assume.

25:44.843 --> 25:48.312
You know, I got married because I
wanted to, despite what you think.

25:48.314 --> 25:49.880
Yeah, what do I think?

25:49.882 --> 25:51.215
Reza, It's none
of my fucking business,

25:51.217 --> 25:52.950
anyway, so WHO cares?

25:52.952 --> 25:55.152
Well, yeah? Well, then,
what's with this attitude?

25:55.154 --> 25:57.054
I have no attitude.

25:57.056 --> 25:59.323
I harbor no bad feelings
towards you

25:59.325 --> 26:01.792
or Shireen for that
matter, not really.

26:01.794 --> 26:03.327
Just I WAS on tour.

26:03.329 --> 26:06.063
Know what? Forget IT.
You don't understand.

26:06.065 --> 26:07.298
No, I do understand.

26:07.300 --> 26:08.866
I don't think you understand.

26:08.868 --> 26:10.768
All right?
I made my moves.

26:10.770 --> 26:12.036
You made your moves.

26:12.038 --> 26:14.772
Sounds like you made
the right ones, right?

26:14.774 --> 26:16.607
You're happy?

26:16.609 --> 26:18.876
We're just different people
now, that's all.

26:18.878 --> 26:21.946
It's not that big
of a fucking deal. Jesus.

26:31.891 --> 26:33.624
Whoa.

26:33.626 --> 26:34.825
Whoa.

26:34.827 --> 26:37.227
Ok, wait.
We gotta pull over, man.

26:37.229 --> 26:38.629
The engine's...
yeah, yeah, yeah.

26:38.631 --> 26:40.364
Fucking seriously stop the...
ok. Ok

26:41.299 --> 26:43.100
ok, this is bad.

26:43.102 --> 26:44.301
Yeah, I'M going.
IT...

26:44.303 --> 26:46.837
well, pull in the ga...
pull in the gas...

26:46.839 --> 26:47.838
It's going badly.

26:52.344 --> 26:56.013
So, uh, where you fellas
headed, anyway?

26:56.015 --> 26:57.014
Uh...

26:57.016 --> 26:59.617
San Francisco.

26:59.619 --> 27:01.018
Oh, yeah?

27:01.020 --> 27:04.154
Going to the gay
parade, are you?

27:04.156 --> 27:05.990
I don't know what that means,

27:05.992 --> 27:08.025
and I'M gonna choose
to ignore IT.

27:08.027 --> 27:09.727
This is a real
mechanic shop, right?

27:09.729 --> 27:12.262
Sure is. Tools, pumps,

27:12.264 --> 27:13.664
everything.

27:13.666 --> 27:14.999
Great.
That's very convenient,

27:15.001 --> 27:18.035
because we need this
fixed right now, a.S.A.P.

27:18.037 --> 27:19.770
Do you know what
that stands for?

27:19.772 --> 27:21.372
As soon as...

27:21.374 --> 27:22.406
Possible.
Possible.

27:22.408 --> 27:24.208
I knew that.

27:24.210 --> 27:26.744
Well, we're gonna have to
poke around in there first.

27:26.746 --> 27:28.312
Could be the alternator.

27:28.314 --> 27:29.780
Could be the distributor.

27:29.782 --> 27:31.315
Could be a piston.

27:31.317 --> 27:34.084
Sometimes they just
don't pump right.

27:34.086 --> 27:35.252
Uh, cool.

27:35.254 --> 27:36.754
Um, let's get a tow truck

27:36.756 --> 27:38.188
to the nearest
regular mechanic.

27:38.190 --> 27:41.291
Hey, now. I am a regular
mechanic, you little shit.

27:41.293 --> 27:42.993
Uh... What are you
trying to do here?

27:42.995 --> 27:44.428
You trying to insult me?

27:44.430 --> 27:46.897
I... I have triple a.

27:46.899 --> 27:48.832
Good for you.

27:48.834 --> 27:51.335
But they won't tow a
truck like this here.

27:53.038 --> 27:55.139
Why not, sir?

27:55.141 --> 27:57.941
IF It's full,
you have to unload IT.

27:57.943 --> 27:59.710
You have to unload IT?

27:59.712 --> 28:02.813
We can't unload
the truck here, man.

28:02.815 --> 28:04.148
No. Jeez, no.

28:04.150 --> 28:06.450
You know where I can get
a drink around here?

28:10.855 --> 28:14.224
Here are some waters
and some menus, guys.

28:14.226 --> 28:15.359
Thank you very much.

28:15.361 --> 28:16.960
I'll be back
to take your order.

28:18.363 --> 28:20.831
What looks good, boys?

28:20.833 --> 28:22.833
I'M gonna go to the bathroom.

28:22.835 --> 28:24.768
Let's order first.

28:30.875 --> 28:32.209
What is his deal?

28:34.479 --> 28:36.280
All right, listen.

28:36.282 --> 28:38.816
I think we need to talk about
what we're gonna do here.

28:38.818 --> 28:41.118
We're waiting for the truck
to be fixed, hopefully.

28:41.120 --> 28:42.820
Yeah, I'M talking
about after that.

28:42.822 --> 28:44.822
We're gonna drop him off
at the place.

28:44.824 --> 28:45.956
What do you think?

28:45.958 --> 28:47.357
Reza, he's not gonna check in.

28:47.359 --> 28:49.760
Then what are we gonna do?

28:49.762 --> 28:51.762
I think we should bring him
to his father's house,

28:51.764 --> 28:53.363
let him get settled in,

28:53.365 --> 28:54.865
and he can make the
decision for himself.

28:54.867 --> 28:56.066
Settled?
Yeah.

28:56.068 --> 28:58.068
His father doesn't
want him there.

29:02.173 --> 29:04.341
We can't always hold
his hand, all right?

29:04.343 --> 29:07.010
He has to be responsible for
his actions at some point.

29:07.012 --> 29:09.012
IF he leaves, he leaves.

29:09.014 --> 29:10.881
We got him there.

29:24.162 --> 29:25.462
Sure doesn't seem
like you care.

29:26.965 --> 29:28.398
Dude, I care, ok?

29:28.400 --> 29:31.502
It's just he has to do
some things for himself.

29:31.504 --> 29:33.937
And I'M a realist.

29:33.939 --> 29:36.273
Why doesn't he stay
with you, huh?

29:36.275 --> 29:38.075
Excuse me.
Hi.

29:38.077 --> 29:39.910
Hi.

29:39.912 --> 29:41.879
Um, sorry to interrupt
the cross-examination,

29:41.881 --> 29:43.413
but can I borrow the hot sauce?

29:43.415 --> 29:45.549
Yeah. It's all yours.
You know what?

29:45.551 --> 29:46.984
As long as you can tell me

29:46.986 --> 29:48.051
WHO sang the song "hot sauce."

29:48.053 --> 29:49.887
Jesus.
Thomas dolby.

29:49.889 --> 29:52.823
Unless you mean "Louisiana
hot sauce" by Sammy Kershaw.

29:52.825 --> 29:55.125
That is fucking impressive.
Did you hear that?

29:55.127 --> 29:56.994
You know what? I WAS just
trying to flirt with you,

29:56.996 --> 29:58.428
but now you can have
anything you want.

29:58.430 --> 29:59.463
I got ketchup.
I hate ketchup.

29:59.465 --> 30:00.898
I got mustard.
I got shitaka.

30:00.900 --> 30:02.833
This is fine.
You sure?

30:02.835 --> 30:04.368
Have a good day.

30:06.070 --> 30:07.571
You dating anyone these days?

30:07.573 --> 30:10.240
I got, like, a couple girls
I'M hanging out with.

30:10.242 --> 30:12.042
Not counting
the Hollywood floozies

30:12.044 --> 30:14.545
you bring home
from the clubs, right?

30:14.547 --> 30:17.581
So do you have them
do the aids test before,

30:17.583 --> 30:19.917
or do you just
assume they have IT

30:19.919 --> 30:21.952
and then play
the fucking odds, man?

30:21.954 --> 30:24.288
You're such an asshole.
Here. Here he comes.

30:24.290 --> 30:26.323
Bag IT before you tag IT.

30:26.325 --> 30:30.861
That means cover your
penis with a condom.

30:30.863 --> 30:33.130
Hey, buddy.

30:33.132 --> 30:36.266
Ok, are you boys
ready to order?

30:36.268 --> 30:38.969
Yeah. I will have
a crispy chicken club

30:38.971 --> 30:42.239
with the skin removed, no
bacon, no Mayo, no tomato,

30:42.241 --> 30:44.975
whole wheat bread.
Did you get IT all?

30:46.211 --> 30:47.911
Thanks.

30:47.913 --> 30:49.279
I'M gonna get the burger,

30:49.281 --> 30:50.280
cheeseburger, medium.
Thank you.

30:50.282 --> 30:51.315
And you, honey?

30:51.317 --> 30:53.517
Uh, a whiskey.

30:53.519 --> 30:56.587
Uh, we only serve
beer and wine.

30:56.589 --> 30:58.288
A whiskey on the rocks.

30:59.325 --> 31:01.959
Beer.

31:01.961 --> 31:03.460
Uh, what kind of beer?

31:03.462 --> 31:04.628
No beer.

31:04.630 --> 31:06.296
No beer.

31:07.599 --> 31:10.868
I'll have a beer, please.

31:10.870 --> 31:13.403
Ok.

31:13.405 --> 31:15.038
A beer.

31:15.040 --> 31:17.541
IF you bring a beer, you
won't get paid for IT,

31:17.543 --> 31:19.243
and you won't get a tip.

31:19.245 --> 31:21.378
Does that make sense?

31:21.380 --> 31:23.981
All right. No beer.

31:23.983 --> 31:25.315
Thank you.

31:26.318 --> 31:27.918
I want a fucking beer.

31:28.653 --> 31:31.321
Bring me a beer, please.

31:33.258 --> 31:35.492
Sorry.

31:35.494 --> 31:38.929
I'll bring more water
to the table, too.

31:38.931 --> 31:39.930
Thank you.

31:39.932 --> 31:41.331
Thanks, Adele.

31:44.202 --> 31:45.335
Dude...

31:45.337 --> 31:48.005
What's wrong with you, man?

31:53.978 --> 31:55.279
You're a child.

31:58.283 --> 31:59.950
What's up with you, bro?

31:59.952 --> 32:02.953
Why you... why you keep
telling people what to do?

32:02.955 --> 32:05.088
Huh?

32:05.090 --> 32:07.691
Only when they need
to be told, guy.

32:09.294 --> 32:10.627
Look at you.

32:10.629 --> 32:13.130
You can't even take care
of yourself anymore.

32:13.132 --> 32:14.998
You're an embarrassment.

32:15.000 --> 32:16.400
Dude, stop.

32:16.402 --> 32:18.168
I feel sorry for you.

32:18.170 --> 32:20.337
Heh.
You feel sorry for me?

32:20.339 --> 32:23.440
'Cause everyone knows
what a prick you are.

32:23.442 --> 32:26.043
People just tolerate you.

32:26.045 --> 32:27.444
Myself included.

32:27.446 --> 32:29.346
Ah, don't make any
exceptions for me, buddy.

32:29.348 --> 32:30.647
Continue to be
your regular self.

32:30.649 --> 32:32.649
Your life is a series
of home runs right now.

32:32.651 --> 32:34.351
Guys, could we just
maybe have 15 minutes

32:34.353 --> 32:36.053
where we don't have
an argument, please?

32:36.055 --> 32:37.154
Can we just...

32:39.525 --> 32:41.625
You know, um...

32:41.627 --> 32:44.528
You know why no one comes to
your big birthday parties?

32:45.563 --> 32:46.997
You know why he didn't show up

32:46.999 --> 32:48.165
at your stupid WEDDING?

32:48.167 --> 32:50.033
You know what, Alex?
Shut up.

32:50.035 --> 32:52.069
You don't know what
you're talking about.

32:52.071 --> 32:56.273
People are a
different code, bro.

32:56.275 --> 32:59.476
Friendship can only
reap what It's sown.

32:59.478 --> 33:00.978
You know?

33:00.980 --> 33:02.379
Can you compute that?

33:02.381 --> 33:04.114
Eh?

33:04.116 --> 33:05.482
Mr. Brainiac?

33:09.188 --> 33:11.455
What are you trying to say?

33:13.558 --> 33:16.326
That nobody likes you.

33:16.328 --> 33:18.161
Jesus.

33:19.097 --> 33:20.163
Well, you know what?

33:20.165 --> 33:21.531
IF you can pay
your fucking rent

33:21.533 --> 33:23.000
or hold down a fucking job

33:23.002 --> 33:24.334
or not be a fucking alcoholic,

33:24.336 --> 33:26.470
I would give a shit about your...
Reza. Reza.

33:26.472 --> 33:29.172
Don't. He thinks he can just sit
there and say this shit to me?

33:29.174 --> 33:30.707
He's had every
opportunity handed to him,

33:30.709 --> 33:32.542
and he has fucked IT up.
Calm down.

33:32.544 --> 33:34.711
No. I had to work
to be where I am.

33:34.713 --> 33:36.546
Everybody knows that.
I know that.

33:36.548 --> 33:38.448
I didn't get to party on the
beach for a fucking decade.

33:38.450 --> 33:40.117
You sound exactly like my dad.

33:40.119 --> 33:41.151
You know what?

33:41.153 --> 33:43.153
I wish I had your dad.

33:43.155 --> 33:45.756
Your dad doesn't
deserve you as a son.

33:45.758 --> 33:48.025
He's too good for you.

33:48.027 --> 33:49.493
Proves to show what you know.

33:49.495 --> 33:52.062
Hey! Knock IT off.

33:52.064 --> 33:54.431
What the fuck
is wrong with you?

33:54.433 --> 33:56.400
There's little kids in here.
We're at a restaurant.

33:56.402 --> 33:57.634
I'M cool as a cucumber, bro.

34:31.235 --> 34:33.303
What do you mean, wrong gas?

34:34.472 --> 34:37.808
You got the wrong gasoline

34:37.810 --> 34:40.476
inside your fuel tank.

34:40.478 --> 34:42.813
This truck don't run
on diesel, boy.

34:42.815 --> 34:44.781
Do you know what that means?

34:48.152 --> 34:51.755
Numbnuts.

34:55.860 --> 34:57.461
Reza, where you going, man?

34:58.596 --> 35:00.430
Rez.

35:01.466 --> 35:03.433
Hey. Reza!

35:03.435 --> 35:05.402
What are you doing, man?
I'M done with this shit.

35:05.404 --> 35:07.370
I'M gonna get a ride back
with some serial killer.

35:07.372 --> 35:09.840
What are you talking about? You
can't leave me alone with this guy.

35:09.842 --> 35:12.375
I don't care what happens to him.
You do what you want.

35:12.377 --> 35:13.543
I have to be home tonight.

35:13.545 --> 35:14.644
What, for the vacation?

35:14.646 --> 35:16.546
I thought you were
making that up.

35:16.548 --> 35:18.482
Come on, man. What are you
gonna tell Mr. Hamilton,

35:18.484 --> 35:20.117
huh? What are you
gonna say to him?

35:20.119 --> 35:21.418
I don't know.
I'll figure IT out.

35:21.420 --> 35:22.552
I just can't deal
with this shit anymore.

35:22.554 --> 35:24.187
No, Rez, you called
me, all right?

35:24.189 --> 35:25.822
You can't leave right now.
You just can't.

35:25.824 --> 35:27.624
This guy's never paid any
consequences for anything, ok?

35:27.626 --> 35:28.758
You think this just happened?

35:28.760 --> 35:30.293
He has to grow up.

35:30.295 --> 35:32.262
So you're gonna take
the easy way out, huh?

35:32.264 --> 35:33.263
The easy way?

35:33.265 --> 35:34.397
Yeah.

35:34.399 --> 35:35.732
You mean taking shit
from your family

35:35.734 --> 35:37.667
and your wife for the
rest of your life?

35:37.669 --> 35:40.370
You know I'M the only one in
our family WHO's not a doctor?

35:40.372 --> 35:42.472
My wife... do you know
how many times

35:42.474 --> 35:44.441
I've had sex in the last year?

35:44.443 --> 35:45.575
Twice.

35:45.577 --> 35:46.776
Christmas and Christmas.

35:46.778 --> 35:48.845
We did IT twice on the same day.

35:48.847 --> 35:50.480
We didn't even space IT out.

35:50.482 --> 35:52.282
You don't think
I'M jealous of you?

35:52.284 --> 35:54.317
You don't think I want to
bring home Hollywood floozies

35:54.319 --> 35:55.652
and just make love to them?

35:55.654 --> 35:57.487
I don't even want to fuck 'em.

35:57.489 --> 36:00.323
I want to look 'em in the eyes
and, like, taste their faces.

36:03.361 --> 36:05.562
You know, for a while,
I thought I could be me

36:05.564 --> 36:06.897
playing in that band
with you, but...

36:06.899 --> 36:09.799
That dream died
for me in high school.

36:09.801 --> 36:12.169
I made a serious choice
in my life

36:12.171 --> 36:13.503
a long time ago, Ethan,

36:13.505 --> 36:15.739
same kind of choice
you're making right now.

36:15.741 --> 36:17.741
I wouldn't compare
our lives, man.

36:17.743 --> 36:18.742
No, I wouldn't.

36:18.744 --> 36:20.410
My life is fine.

36:20.412 --> 36:21.811
I'M happy.

36:21.813 --> 36:24.281
IT sounds like IT.

36:24.283 --> 36:25.282
Sold out, man.

36:25.284 --> 36:26.449
Sold out?

36:26.451 --> 36:28.919
What are you, 14?
What does that mean?

36:28.921 --> 36:31.454
Why don't you keep walking.
I'M gonna go back inside

36:31.456 --> 36:33.523
and try to fix this situation.

36:33.525 --> 36:35.425
You know what?
Maybe you should have

36:35.427 --> 36:37.260
listened to me
and gone to college.

36:37.262 --> 36:39.262
Your life would be better now.

36:39.264 --> 36:41.831
Oh, my life is fine.

36:41.833 --> 36:43.466
Thank you very much.

36:43.468 --> 36:45.835
Yeah, your life is great.
It's really great.

36:45.837 --> 36:48.271
"Oh, this one has central
air conditioning..."

36:48.273 --> 36:49.839
you do not know
what you're talking about.

36:49.841 --> 36:53.710
You think you're the only
fucking person with problems?

36:53.712 --> 36:55.245
I WAS a fool, man.

36:55.247 --> 36:56.980
I WAS a fool
to follow my dream,

36:56.982 --> 36:59.749
think I could make IT in
music, do whatever I want.

36:59.751 --> 37:02.352
You thin... you think I wanted
to be a one-hit wonder?

37:02.354 --> 37:03.920
No! No!

37:05.456 --> 37:06.756
I failed, man.

37:08.292 --> 37:09.626
I failed.

37:09.628 --> 37:12.896
Is that... is that what
you wanted to hear me say?

37:12.898 --> 37:14.431
There. I said IT.

37:29.981 --> 37:31.815
What?
Shut up.

37:31.817 --> 37:32.816
Wasn't my fault.

37:32.818 --> 37:35.685
You know what?
Just shut up.

37:36.721 --> 37:38.688
Is there anything
that we can do,

37:38.690 --> 37:40.690
anything at all,
to make this work today?

37:40.692 --> 37:43.460
I'd pay you extra, something,

37:43.462 --> 37:45.428
anything. Please?

37:45.430 --> 37:47.931
Sorry, fellas.

37:47.933 --> 37:50.967
It's gonna be tomorrow morning.

37:50.969 --> 37:53.403
Nice motel across the street.

37:53.405 --> 37:56.539
Might have to bunk
together or something.

38:40.651 --> 38:42.552
How room you want?
Extra charge for three.

38:45.990 --> 38:47.324
What?

38:47.326 --> 38:49.592
Why would I kn...

38:49.594 --> 38:51.328
how many rooms we want?

38:51.330 --> 38:52.862
There's extra charge for three.

38:52.864 --> 38:55.799
One room, please.

38:55.801 --> 38:56.633
Whoo!

39:01.072 --> 39:02.739
So what do you guys want to do?

39:02.741 --> 39:05.575
What, you want to play,
like, a game or something?

39:05.577 --> 39:07.811
Hide and go seek?
Charades.

39:07.813 --> 39:10.680
Ok, It's not even
6:00 yet, man.

39:10.682 --> 39:13.083
Let's just stay in,
get an early dinner,

39:13.085 --> 39:14.784
go to bed.

39:14.786 --> 39:17.654
Can we go up past 10:00 tonight, dad?
Please? Please?

39:17.656 --> 39:19.356
I'M not even gonna look at you.

39:19.358 --> 39:21.624
Ok, well, I can't stay
in here all night, so...

39:21.626 --> 39:23.126
I'M not even gonna look at you.

39:23.128 --> 39:25.028
I'M gonna go outside.

39:25.030 --> 39:26.563
You shouldn't smoke!

39:26.565 --> 39:27.764
Shouldn't smoke!

39:27.766 --> 39:31.101
Oh. Loser line calling.

39:43.714 --> 39:46.383
I'll call you when we're
packing up tomorrow.

39:46.385 --> 39:49.085
Yeah. Talk to you later.

39:53.090 --> 39:54.090
Hey.

39:54.092 --> 39:55.625
Hot sauce.

39:55.627 --> 39:56.826
Yeah.

39:56.828 --> 39:59.863
You guys sightseeing
or something?

39:59.865 --> 40:02.532
Yeah, It's beautiful country
up here, lots to see.

40:02.534 --> 40:03.967
Our truck broke down.

40:03.969 --> 40:05.168
Oh.

40:05.170 --> 40:06.436
Sorry about that.

40:07.438 --> 40:09.439
I WAS sick of driving anyway.

40:09.441 --> 40:10.607
Where you going?

40:10.609 --> 40:12.876
Uh, you know what?
I'M not sure.

40:12.878 --> 40:14.544
I-I'M not sure.

40:15.813 --> 40:17.714
Well, I gotta get going.

40:17.716 --> 40:19.749
Hope IT all works out.

40:19.751 --> 40:21.618
Thank you.

40:21.620 --> 40:23.086
Hey, you know what?
Listen.

40:23.088 --> 40:24.687
Uh...

40:24.689 --> 40:27.090
Want to have a cigarette,
keep me company?

40:27.092 --> 40:28.958
I don't want to go
back inside right now.

40:28.960 --> 40:30.093
Why not?
Yeah? Here.

40:31.129 --> 40:32.862
Here, let me get that for you,

40:32.864 --> 40:35.198
be a gentleman here for
a quick second. Here.

40:36.133 --> 40:38.468
There you go.

40:38.470 --> 40:40.069
I'M Ethan.

40:40.071 --> 40:42.772
Oh, yeah. April.
Sorry.

40:42.774 --> 40:45.074
Yeah. So what are you
doing here in, uh...

40:45.076 --> 40:46.709
Lebec? Where are we?
Yeah. Lebec.

40:46.711 --> 40:49.612
Oh. Yeah, we stay here
all the time, actually.

40:49.614 --> 40:51.181
Yeah, for real.

40:51.183 --> 40:53.981
I drive this truck down
from modesto to L.A.

40:54.007 --> 40:54.851
twice a week.

40:54.853 --> 40:56.519
Get the fuck out of here.

40:56.521 --> 40:58.121
You're a lady truck driver?
That's awesome.

40:58.123 --> 40:59.989
I bring avocados
from my family's ranch

40:59.991 --> 41:01.691
to the farmers market
in L.A.

41:01.693 --> 41:02.759
Yeah?

41:02.761 --> 41:04.828
Yep. California
golden avocados,

41:04.830 --> 41:05.962
the best.

41:05.964 --> 41:07.197
My sister and I.

41:07.199 --> 41:09.799
Allows me the free time
to do what I want.

41:10.801 --> 41:12.068
Got a real polaroid there, huh?

41:12.070 --> 41:13.603
What kind of pictures
you taking?

41:13.605 --> 41:15.238
Oh, yeah. Um...

41:15.240 --> 41:16.940
All kinds, really,

41:16.942 --> 41:18.241
but mostly people.

41:18.243 --> 41:20.977
I get to see all types
out here, especially.

41:20.979 --> 41:22.612
Yeah, I'll bet. Yeah.
Yeah.

41:22.614 --> 41:24.080
So what about you?

41:24.082 --> 41:25.548
What do you do?

41:25.550 --> 41:27.217
I'M a musician, actually.

41:27.219 --> 41:28.685
Yeah?
Yeah.

41:28.687 --> 41:31.087
Yeah, I WAS in a band
for a few years.

41:31.089 --> 41:32.822
What was the band?

41:32.824 --> 41:34.190
C.B.M.M.

41:34.192 --> 41:36.726
We had a song, "higher,"

41:36.728 --> 41:38.728
got a lot of radio play
there for a while.

41:38.730 --> 41:40.697
Maybe IF I heard IT.

41:40.699 --> 41:43.032
You know, we played a lot
of clubs and venues.

41:43.034 --> 41:44.534
Actually, we got to open for

41:44.536 --> 41:46.002
the smashing pumpkins
on a tour leg.

41:46.004 --> 41:47.570
So what happened?

41:49.273 --> 41:51.808
Nothing happened.
That was IT, I guess.

41:53.010 --> 41:54.978
Just got sick of...

41:54.980 --> 41:58.615
Checking I.D.S and serving
drinks, you know.

42:00.184 --> 42:01.518
That's too bad.

42:01.520 --> 42:04.888
So what are you doing now?

42:08.225 --> 42:10.793
Yeah.

42:10.795 --> 42:11.828
I know the feeling.

42:11.830 --> 42:13.596
Heh.

42:14.899 --> 42:16.599
Hey, um...

42:16.601 --> 42:17.901
I should probably get going.

42:17.903 --> 42:19.969
My sister's waiting for me.
All right.

42:19.971 --> 42:21.538
But, you know,
thanks for the smoke.

42:21.540 --> 42:23.072
Yeah.

42:23.074 --> 42:24.207
Hey, listen.

42:24.209 --> 42:26.643
I, uh, wanted to ask you...

42:27.811 --> 42:30.113
Is there anything to do
around here, or...

42:30.115 --> 42:32.549
No.
No.

42:33.752 --> 42:35.218
There is a bar, though,

42:35.220 --> 42:36.586
right down the street.

42:36.588 --> 42:38.755
Come have a drink with me.

42:38.757 --> 42:39.989
What, now?

42:39.991 --> 42:40.990
Yeah.

42:40.992 --> 42:42.725
Oh, I...

42:42.727 --> 42:45.895
I don't know. I have to be in L.A.
bright and early.

42:45.897 --> 42:47.764
All right, you know what?
You twisted my arm.

42:47.766 --> 42:48.765
I'll go with you.

42:48.767 --> 42:51.000
Nice to meet you.

42:51.002 --> 42:52.302
You, too.

43:02.346 --> 43:03.780
Heh.

43:20.164 --> 43:21.664
What's going on in there?

43:23.300 --> 43:25.368
Nothing, man.
Just taking a dump.

43:29.206 --> 43:31.674
Alex, open up.

43:31.676 --> 43:33.710
Hey, hey, can't a guy
go in peace, huh?

43:45.356 --> 43:48.625
Why is the door locked?

43:48.627 --> 43:50.360
What's up with you, dude?

43:50.362 --> 43:52.295
Smells funny in here.

43:52.297 --> 43:54.764
No shit.

43:59.937 --> 44:02.171
Hand IT over. Give
IT to me right now.

44:02.173 --> 44:04.140
I'M not playing around.
What?

44:04.142 --> 44:05.942
IF you took a dump, why
didn't you wash your hands?

44:05.944 --> 44:07.644
Give IT to me.
Oh, come on.

44:07.646 --> 44:09.379
I'M not fucking playing around.
What do you want?

44:09.381 --> 44:10.847
Give IT to me right now. Yeah?

44:10.849 --> 44:12.248
Give IT to me.
What? You want this?

44:12.250 --> 44:13.783
Give IT here.
Give IT to me.

44:13.785 --> 44:14.984
Don't do that.
Don't fucking do that.

44:14.986 --> 44:16.653
I'M not going to do IT.
I dare you.

44:16.655 --> 44:18.354
I'M not gonna do IT.
Don't fucking do that.

44:18.356 --> 44:20.256
See what happens
IF you do IT. Don't...

44:23.360 --> 44:24.927
Ahh!

44:26.765 --> 44:27.830
My glasses!

44:39.710 --> 44:40.777
Stop IT.

44:42.179 --> 44:44.047
You maniac.

44:46.750 --> 44:48.017
Get off of me!

44:48.019 --> 44:49.986
Stop IT!

44:55.859 --> 44:58.194
What the hell?
What the fuck?

44:58.196 --> 45:00.863
I can hear you guys all
the way down the hall.

45:00.865 --> 45:03.132
You all right?
It's happy hour.

45:03.134 --> 45:06.369
He's an alcoholic and needs
professional help. I told you.

45:06.371 --> 45:08.004
WHO the fuck
do you think you are?

45:08.006 --> 45:09.739
I don't even know you, dude.

45:09.741 --> 45:11.240
I don't even have
your number, man.

45:11.242 --> 45:13.076
Cool off. Get off of me.
And WHO are you?

45:13.078 --> 45:14.803
What, are you some kind
of professional now?

45:14.829 --> 45:15.378
Is that right?

45:15.380 --> 45:16.412
No more rock star?

45:16.414 --> 45:19.315
Well, I'M still the same.

45:19.317 --> 45:21.284
Still the fucking same.

45:21.286 --> 45:23.186
You are completely out
of control right now.

45:23.188 --> 45:24.487
I'M out of control?
Yeah.

45:24.489 --> 45:25.755
Yeah?
Yeah.

45:27.324 --> 45:28.891
You don't know out of control.

45:28.893 --> 45:31.961
This is just my regular,
everyday life.

45:31.963 --> 45:34.464
Front-row seats, baby.

45:34.466 --> 45:36.132
I don't have to explain myself

45:36.134 --> 45:39.102
to a bunch of prick
fucking liars, now, do I?

45:39.104 --> 45:41.237
Alex, calm down.
What are you talking about?

45:41.239 --> 45:43.139
Can't even understand
what you're trying to say.

45:44.475 --> 45:46.008
Hey.

45:46.010 --> 45:48.411
What am I talking about?
Yeah.

45:48.413 --> 45:50.913
What am I talking about?

45:50.915 --> 45:55.485
I'M not going to your
fucking facility.

45:57.254 --> 46:01.324
Yeah. What, you thought you were
gonna trick me? Is that IT?

46:02.526 --> 46:04.293
WHO are you?

46:04.295 --> 46:07.930
WHO the fuck do you
think you are? Huh?

46:10.501 --> 46:12.769
You and my dad

46:12.771 --> 46:14.303
can all go suck IT.

46:14.305 --> 46:18.274
Can all go suck IT.

46:18.276 --> 46:19.909
Jesus Christ.

46:19.911 --> 46:21.844
Alex, just sit down.

46:21.846 --> 46:24.013
Let's just talk about IT.

46:24.015 --> 46:25.915
I'M not sitting down.

46:25.917 --> 46:27.116
I'M not sitting down.

46:27.118 --> 46:28.985
Out of here.

46:28.987 --> 46:31.254
Where are you gonna go?
Come on.

46:31.256 --> 46:33.156
Stay away from me.

46:33.158 --> 46:34.157
Wow, dude.

46:34.159 --> 46:35.892
I'M gonna go after him.

46:35.894 --> 46:36.893
What?
Yeah.

46:36.895 --> 46:38.294
No. He needs
to blow off

46:38.296 --> 46:39.462
some steam.
Let him go.

46:39.464 --> 46:41.831
There's a bar
down the street, ok?

46:43.967 --> 46:46.302
Alex.

46:46.304 --> 46:48.905
Listen, I'M sorry how
this all went down, man.

46:48.907 --> 46:50.239
We didn't plan for any of IT.

46:50.241 --> 46:51.407
This is all happening
right now.

46:51.409 --> 46:53.009
Your dad sprung IT on us.

46:53.011 --> 46:54.510
I can't believe you
betrayed me. I can't...

46:54.512 --> 46:56.212
I can't believe you're
siding with them.

46:56.214 --> 46:58.080
I didn't betray you.
I'M not siding with anyone.

46:58.082 --> 46:59.315
I'M worried about you.
Whatever.

46:59.317 --> 47:00.349
Tomorrow I'M going
back to San Diego.

47:00.351 --> 47:01.450
You can go wherever you want.

47:01.452 --> 47:02.585
Yeah, thank you.
I know.

47:02.587 --> 47:05.121
Hey, stop. Stop.

47:05.123 --> 47:07.824
I mean, you sure
this is a good idea?

47:43.027 --> 47:45.228
Two shots Tequila, sir.

47:45.230 --> 47:47.530
No, no, no.
I don't want a drink.

47:48.498 --> 47:49.932
Two shots.

47:53.036 --> 47:55.071
How you fellas
doing this evening?

47:55.073 --> 47:56.539
Good. Thank you.
Oh, I'M doing great.

47:56.541 --> 48:00.009
My two old friends,
they kidnap me,

48:00.011 --> 48:02.111
bring me to this shithole town

48:02.113 --> 48:04.881
until I can figure out
my next place to go.

48:09.086 --> 48:10.253
Two more, please.

48:12.422 --> 48:13.589
Thank you.

48:16.593 --> 48:20.296
Alex, to new beginnings, right?

48:20.298 --> 48:22.031
Hey.

48:29.139 --> 48:30.539
I gotta piss.

48:37.514 --> 48:41.217
Can I have another one
of those, please? Ahem.

49:09.413 --> 49:11.414
Ah, mother bitch.

49:11.416 --> 49:13.649
Well, you're three sheets, man.
What do you expect?

49:13.651 --> 49:15.518
I'M not three sheets.
What are you talking about?

49:15.520 --> 49:17.053
You could have fooled me.

49:17.055 --> 49:20.056
Hey, you keep on
lecturing me like that,

49:20.058 --> 49:22.325
It's not a good idea, ok?

49:22.327 --> 49:25.695
You guys are just always
talking and fucking...

49:25.697 --> 49:28.297
Listen, I'M not gonna pretend
I know what the problem is.

49:28.299 --> 49:29.732
Then don't.
Don't pretend.

49:29.734 --> 49:32.001
But you can't
keep this up, man.

49:32.003 --> 49:33.302
You just can't.

49:33.304 --> 49:34.637
I'M not going
to that fucking place,

49:34.639 --> 49:36.439
ok, no matter what you say.

49:36.441 --> 49:38.641
So IF that's the only reason
why you came here, then...

49:38.643 --> 49:40.643
No. Just...

49:40.645 --> 49:42.378
I don't know, man.

49:42.380 --> 49:44.213
I just... I wish
I had your life.

49:44.215 --> 49:46.282
I don't even know
what I would do.

49:46.284 --> 49:47.383
Yeah?
Yeah.

49:47.385 --> 49:49.251
What would you do?

49:50.320 --> 49:52.054
I don't know.
I guess...

49:52.056 --> 49:55.324
I'd do whatever I wanted,
whatever made me happy.

49:56.526 --> 49:58.060
Isn't that what you been doing

49:58.062 --> 49:59.662
the past 10 years of your life?

50:11.475 --> 50:13.576
I mean, just 'cause you
decide to be something, bro,

50:13.578 --> 50:15.111
doesn't mean you can be.

50:15.113 --> 50:17.613
You are what you are.

50:17.615 --> 50:19.648
I just... I don't...
I just don't get IT.

50:19.650 --> 50:21.450
What do you mean?
What the fuck...

50:21.452 --> 50:23.019
why does everybody
keep saying that?

50:23.021 --> 50:24.587
Maybe 'cause It's true.

50:24.589 --> 50:26.655
I mean, you're
a fucking real estate agent.

50:26.657 --> 50:28.357
I could be a real estate agent.

50:28.359 --> 50:30.426
Yeah, I can be
a fucking astronaut as well.

50:30.428 --> 50:32.161
Heh!

50:34.164 --> 50:36.365
Hey, man, hey, you know what?

50:36.367 --> 50:38.234
Don't listen to me,

50:38.236 --> 50:41.137
'cause I don't know what the
fuck I'M talking about.

50:47.210 --> 50:48.778
Bitch! Fuck!

50:48.780 --> 50:50.546
I could have told you
that was gonna go badly.

50:50.548 --> 50:51.547
Bad time?

50:51.549 --> 50:52.615
Yeah... no.

50:52.617 --> 50:53.616
Yes.

50:53.618 --> 50:55.418
No. Hey.

50:55.420 --> 50:56.519
Hey.

50:56.521 --> 50:58.554
You guys wanna
play some billiards?

50:59.623 --> 51:00.689
Allison?

51:02.726 --> 51:04.827
Oh, Allison.

51:18.175 --> 51:19.742
Keep your eye on the ball.

51:21.179 --> 51:22.178
Yes.

51:22.180 --> 51:25.514
And, Oh!

51:25.516 --> 51:27.416
That was our ball,
so you get to go.

51:27.418 --> 51:28.417
All right, you're up, baby.

51:28.419 --> 51:29.452
It's my turn?
Yeah.

51:29.454 --> 51:31.253
"Baby"?
Well...

51:31.255 --> 51:32.588
You calling me baby now?

51:32.590 --> 51:34.457
Sorry. I get a little
ahead of myself sometimes.

51:34.459 --> 51:35.825
Uh-huh. All right,
where should I go?

51:35.827 --> 51:38.127
Um, I'M thinking the 12,

51:38.129 --> 51:39.261
corner pocket.

51:39.263 --> 51:40.663
How's that sound?
Looks doable.

51:40.665 --> 51:42.498
Just as good
as anything else, right?

51:42.500 --> 51:43.499
Yeah.

51:43.501 --> 51:45.434
Ready?

51:46.471 --> 51:47.870
Nice shot. Rez!

51:47.872 --> 51:49.338
Hey, man.

51:49.340 --> 51:50.739
We were just talking about you.

51:51.708 --> 51:53.342
Hey, this is...
this is April,

51:53.344 --> 51:54.844
hot sauce...
Hey.

51:54.846 --> 51:55.845
And her sister Allison.

51:55.847 --> 51:57.246
Hey. Great.
This is Reza.

51:57.248 --> 51:59.381
Great. Can I talk
to you real quick?

51:59.383 --> 52:01.250
Hmm? I need to talk
to you real quick.

52:01.252 --> 52:02.818
No, no, no.
Not right now.

52:02.820 --> 52:04.753
Listen. Listen, let's go get
a table, get some food...

52:04.755 --> 52:06.222
Yes.
Some beers. Yes?

52:06.224 --> 52:07.890
I am so ready for
this game to be over.

52:07.892 --> 52:09.592
This is the worst game of
pool anybody's ever played.

52:09.594 --> 52:10.659
Yes. Thank you.

52:10.661 --> 52:12.761
Allison, you in?
I know you are.

52:12.763 --> 52:14.463
Let's do this.
Rez, come on.

52:29.846 --> 52:31.347
Are we talking
about onions now?

52:31.349 --> 52:32.848
I didn't know they had
so many calories.

52:32.850 --> 52:34.483
Surprising amount of calories.

52:34.485 --> 52:36.819
Come on.
Stealth calories?

52:36.821 --> 52:38.387
In onions? So weird?

52:38.389 --> 52:40.723
That's what IT said.

52:40.725 --> 52:42.491
So April was telling me

52:42.493 --> 52:44.393
that you are a singer.

52:44.395 --> 52:45.728
Mm-hmm.

52:45.730 --> 52:46.729
Used to be.

52:46.731 --> 52:48.397
Used to be?
Yeah.

52:48.399 --> 52:50.432
It's... that chapter
is closed

52:50.434 --> 52:51.867
meaning?

52:51.869 --> 52:53.536
Meaning...
I don't know.

52:53.538 --> 52:56.272
You ask Reza. Reza, you
tell 'em about IT.

52:56.274 --> 52:57.473
He knows all about IT.

52:57.475 --> 52:58.674
Reza?
Right. I'M a sell-out.

52:58.676 --> 53:00.209
No, you know what?
Actually,

53:00.211 --> 53:01.577
truth...
truth be told,

53:01.579 --> 53:04.680
Rez was an excellent
bassist in high school.

53:04.682 --> 53:06.182
Really?
Yes.

53:06.184 --> 53:08.450
Oh, did you guys
used to play together

53:08.452 --> 53:09.652
in, like, a band or something?

53:09.654 --> 53:11.954
Something like that.
Something like that.

53:11.956 --> 53:12.955
Yeah.

53:12.957 --> 53:14.657
Hey, hey, hello, everybody.

53:14.659 --> 53:16.825
It's Thursday night.

53:16.827 --> 53:18.827
Y'all know
what that means, right?

53:18.829 --> 53:20.829
Hah! That's right.

53:20.831 --> 53:22.965
It's karaoke night
here at trails.

53:22.967 --> 53:24.633
So why don't you come on up...

53:24.635 --> 53:26.635
Oh, my God, yes.
And show us your stuff?

53:26.637 --> 53:27.636
What?

53:27.638 --> 53:28.671
You're gonna sing, right?

53:28.673 --> 53:30.372
Mm-hmm.
No, no, no, no.

53:30.374 --> 53:32.241
No, no, no. I wasn't
planning on IT, no.

53:32.243 --> 53:33.475
No? Why not?
No, no, no, no.

53:33.477 --> 53:34.610
Yeah. Why not?

53:34.612 --> 53:35.878
Yeah, Ethan, sing something.

53:35.880 --> 53:37.313
You have to.

53:37.315 --> 53:39.348
Oh, I have to?
No, you know what?

53:39.350 --> 53:40.816
I really don't
feel like IT, guys.

53:40.818 --> 53:42.585
I don't even know what
their selection would be.

53:42.587 --> 53:44.853
It's probably
all country and...

53:44.855 --> 53:46.522
Come on.

53:46.524 --> 53:47.923
Are you forcing me right now?

53:47.925 --> 53:50.559
I am forcing you.
All right, all right.

53:50.561 --> 53:52.628
I'M following you.
I'M following you.

53:53.663 --> 53:54.830
Heh.
Hi.

53:54.832 --> 53:56.532
Hi.

54:08.713 --> 54:10.846
What are you, nervous?
I don't know.

54:10.848 --> 54:13.349
I mean, as long
as your heart's in IT

54:13.351 --> 54:14.817
and you're on key...

54:14.819 --> 54:17.286
I'M joking.

54:17.288 --> 54:20.422
There's always a siren
singing you to shipwreck.

54:20.424 --> 54:22.324
Radiohead.

54:22.326 --> 54:24.260
Hey, yeah.

54:25.428 --> 54:26.629
What? Hmm?

54:26.631 --> 54:28.964
You expecting
a call or something?

54:28.966 --> 54:30.432
Yeah. Sorry.

54:30.434 --> 54:31.433
Sorry.

54:31.435 --> 54:33.369
Oh, no.
Is IT your wife?

54:33.371 --> 54:34.503
Yep.

54:34.505 --> 54:37.606
Um, you just, like,
call her, then.

54:37.608 --> 54:40.743
I don't want to, so...

54:49.320 --> 54:50.953
Well, this just
balances out here.

54:50.955 --> 54:52.621
Yes.
You gave up

54:52.623 --> 54:54.723
a career as a high-powered
clinical psychologist...

54:54.725 --> 54:55.791
Oh, high-powered.

54:55.793 --> 54:56.925
To drive an avocado truck.

54:56.927 --> 54:58.594
Yeah. Mm-hmm.
This is a big deal.

54:58.596 --> 55:00.462
I think this is fucking
awesome myself.

55:00.464 --> 55:04.833
I don't want to sit behind a
computer my whole life, you know.

55:09.540 --> 55:11.507
But you only got
one life to live, right?

55:11.509 --> 55:13.309
Right. No regrets.

55:15.646 --> 55:17.913
Fuck a hooker!

55:35.366 --> 55:38.334
Whoo!
Yeah!

55:41.572 --> 55:43.639
This is me.

55:43.641 --> 55:45.074
Oh, my God.
You're gonna kill IT.

55:45.076 --> 55:46.809
I think so.
Yeah.

55:46.811 --> 55:48.344
Keep those fingers crossed.

55:48.346 --> 55:50.412
Let's hear IT for him.

55:54.751 --> 55:55.984
Boom.

55:55.986 --> 55:57.619
This is for you.

55:57.621 --> 55:59.388
All right.
Yay!

56:00.623 --> 56:02.358
Ah, couple drinks.

56:02.360 --> 56:03.726
Little liquid courage here.

56:44.969 --> 56:46.935
Come on. He's so awesome.
Come on.

57:46.095 --> 57:50.199
Yeah! Oww, oww, oww!

58:01.044 --> 58:03.779
All right, let's hear
IT for him, huh?

58:03.781 --> 58:05.747
Whoo!

58:05.749 --> 58:09.151
Good to hear an
earful of that, huh?

58:09.153 --> 58:10.953
All right.

58:10.955 --> 58:12.821
Want a cigarette?

58:12.823 --> 58:14.590
Yes.
Ok.

58:15.725 --> 58:16.725
We got a little...

58:16.727 --> 58:18.160
I mean, WHO wears shorts?

58:18.162 --> 58:19.828
It's cold weather up here.

58:19.830 --> 58:21.129
IT was warm earlier.

58:21.131 --> 58:22.798
Yeah, IT was warm earlier.

58:22.800 --> 58:24.900
You're like an old vet of
Lebec, I think, right?

58:24.902 --> 58:26.201
I mean...
It's cold out.

58:26.203 --> 58:27.202
Uh-huh.
Mm-hmm.

58:27.204 --> 58:28.270
Here you go.

58:28.272 --> 58:29.571
Thank you.

58:30.640 --> 58:33.842
You want to kiss me?

58:33.844 --> 58:35.210
Yeah.

58:35.212 --> 58:37.646
Ever since I saw you.

58:38.648 --> 58:40.516
I shouldn't even be in here.

58:40.518 --> 58:42.684
You could be
some kind of weirdo.

58:44.020 --> 58:48.190
Ethan bishop,
the rock-'n'-roll life.

58:48.192 --> 58:50.292
Oh, you know IT.
Fuck, yeah, baby.

59:02.005 --> 59:03.171
All right.

59:06.309 --> 59:09.311
There's something
I like about you.

59:09.313 --> 59:12.047
Yeah, what's that?

59:12.049 --> 59:14.182
I don't know.

59:14.184 --> 59:18.287
It's a certain draw to you.

59:20.890 --> 59:22.257
I feel IT.

01:00:12.675 --> 01:00:14.610
We should probably get back.

01:00:14.612 --> 01:00:16.812
We should probably...
yeah.

01:00:16.814 --> 01:00:19.748
No, you're probably right.

01:00:19.750 --> 01:00:21.016
Heh.

01:00:38.102 --> 01:00:39.101
You're horrible.

01:00:49.813 --> 01:00:51.213
Stop!

01:00:56.252 --> 01:00:58.654
Come fucking off!

01:00:58.656 --> 01:01:00.822
Don't appreciate...

01:01:03.693 --> 01:01:05.327
That's IT.

01:01:05.329 --> 01:01:07.896
That's enough of this shit.

01:01:09.433 --> 01:01:11.199
Get off that stage
right now, boy,

01:01:11.201 --> 01:01:12.267
right now.

01:01:14.404 --> 01:01:16.138
Hey.

01:01:33.857 --> 01:01:35.857
Oh, jeez!

01:01:35.859 --> 01:01:38.026
It's all right, man.
Just get the poison out.

01:01:38.028 --> 01:01:39.061
Ugh!
Get that out.

01:01:39.063 --> 01:01:40.195
It's fucking bloody, man.

01:01:40.197 --> 01:01:42.130
All right, It's all...

01:01:42.132 --> 01:01:43.732
We'll get you some water,
and then We'll go

01:01:43.734 --> 01:01:45.067
to the bed, ok?
Give me a second.

01:01:45.069 --> 01:01:47.002
Have you been drinking blood?
What the fuck?

01:01:47.004 --> 01:01:48.470
Give me a second.
I can't fucking hear you.

01:01:48.472 --> 01:01:49.771
What?
Give me a... leave.

01:01:49.773 --> 01:01:52.307
Get out... get the fuck
out of here.

01:01:53.342 --> 01:01:54.476
Fuck this.

01:01:54.478 --> 01:01:56.078
I'M done with this
fucking shit.

01:01:56.080 --> 01:01:57.813
What the fuck?!
Roll over.

01:01:57.815 --> 01:01:59.347
Help me.
Help me. Help me.

01:01:59.349 --> 01:02:00.882
I'M over playing fucking
retarded with you.

01:02:00.884 --> 01:02:03.318
Flip him over.
Fuck!

01:02:03.320 --> 01:02:05.253
Don't move! Is that a
fucking crack pipe?

01:02:05.255 --> 01:02:07.089
No!

01:02:07.091 --> 01:02:08.390
Jesus Christ, man!

01:02:10.294 --> 01:02:12.294
Get off!

01:02:14.230 --> 01:02:16.031
No! Aah!

01:02:16.033 --> 01:02:17.733
Come on, man.
Come on.

01:02:17.735 --> 01:02:20.102
Calm down.
Calm down.

01:02:20.104 --> 01:02:21.103
Calm down, man.

01:02:24.907 --> 01:02:26.942
Alex!

01:02:29.412 --> 01:02:30.412
Stay away from me.

01:02:30.414 --> 01:02:31.813
Whoa.
Whoa.

01:02:31.815 --> 01:02:33.081
Stay away from me!

01:02:33.083 --> 01:02:34.783
Jesus, man.

01:02:34.785 --> 01:02:37.185
What are you guys trying to do?

01:02:37.187 --> 01:02:39.788
Alex, put the gun down.

01:02:39.790 --> 01:02:42.257
You guys can't do this to me.

01:02:42.259 --> 01:02:43.492
Put IT down.

01:02:43.494 --> 01:02:44.960
I'M Alex Hamilton.

01:02:49.365 --> 01:02:51.533
Aw, no, man. Come on.

01:03:14.257 --> 01:03:15.957
Oh, fuck.

01:04:13.316 --> 01:04:16.384
Hey, you, uh,

01:04:16.386 --> 01:04:18.486
remember when Alex's mom died

01:04:18.488 --> 01:04:21.089
and he was, like,
completely inconsolable

01:04:21.091 --> 01:04:24.192
and his dad made him read
that poem at the funeral?

01:04:24.194 --> 01:04:25.193
You remember that?

01:04:25.195 --> 01:04:26.862
Yeah.

01:04:26.864 --> 01:04:28.230
IT was...

01:04:28.232 --> 01:04:30.932
I don't think he'd
slept for, like, days.

01:04:30.934 --> 01:04:32.467
He could hardly stand up.

01:04:32.469 --> 01:04:34.436
IT was hard
to watch him up there...

01:04:36.172 --> 01:04:38.006
But he made IT through IT.

01:04:39.942 --> 01:04:42.644
Hey, do you know
I had to fucking Google

01:04:42.646 --> 01:04:45.213
how to get bullets
out of that thing?

01:04:45.215 --> 01:04:46.214
No.
Yeah.

01:04:46.216 --> 01:04:47.582
Really?
I googled IT.

01:04:47.584 --> 01:04:49.451
And I didn't know what
kind of gun IT was,

01:04:49.453 --> 01:04:51.019
so I had to do an image search,

01:04:51.021 --> 01:04:52.587
and I literally had the
gun up to my computer,

01:04:52.589 --> 01:04:54.923
like, "Oh, that's not quite IT.

01:04:54.925 --> 01:04:56.925
Oh, that's
not IT either."

01:04:58.061 --> 01:04:59.661
Shit.

01:05:10.106 --> 01:05:12.607
I mean, you're still here.
I'M surprised.

01:05:12.609 --> 01:05:15.543
Well, I've got
your jacket, and, um...

01:05:15.545 --> 01:05:17.579
Thank you.
Yeah.

01:05:17.581 --> 01:05:20.181
I didn't wanna leave without
saying anything, so...

01:05:21.350 --> 01:05:22.550
I'M glad.

01:05:22.552 --> 01:05:24.519
Is your friend all right?

01:05:25.454 --> 01:05:27.622
Not really, no.

01:05:27.624 --> 01:05:28.690
Sorry.

01:05:31.427 --> 01:05:32.694
I've gotta go.

01:05:32.696 --> 01:05:35.497
Well, listen,
I'll walk with you.

01:05:39.235 --> 01:05:43.305
So, listen, maybe, um, we could get
together when you're in L.A. sometime.

01:05:46.375 --> 01:05:50.345
You know, even IF
you change direction,

01:05:50.347 --> 01:05:52.080
keep going.

01:05:59.655 --> 01:06:01.289
Come here.

01:06:05.228 --> 01:06:07.696
Damn IT. Heh.

01:06:09.432 --> 01:06:12.634
IT was nice meeting you, Ethan.

01:06:12.636 --> 01:06:14.436
Yeah, you, too.

01:06:21.978 --> 01:06:23.044
Hey, listen.

01:06:27.283 --> 01:06:29.384
Find me some time.

01:06:30.619 --> 01:06:33.755
It's better to burn out
than to fade away.

01:06:33.757 --> 01:06:35.123
Heh.

01:06:37.026 --> 01:06:38.426
Neil young.

01:06:38.428 --> 01:06:40.161
Heh.

01:07:06.756 --> 01:07:08.056
Shit.

01:07:08.058 --> 01:07:10.759
Shit.

01:07:14.630 --> 01:07:18.133
Truck is ready. I saw
IT parked out front.

01:07:19.269 --> 01:07:20.635
Where'd you go?

01:07:20.637 --> 01:07:22.637
Coffees. Come on.
Let's go. Let's go.

01:07:22.639 --> 01:07:24.739
What are we gonna do
about this room?

01:07:24.741 --> 01:07:26.808
Well, we're probably gonna
lose the security deposit.

01:07:28.144 --> 01:07:29.711
Shireen must be pissed, huh?

01:07:29.713 --> 01:07:32.347
Yeah. Your balls
look great in pink.

01:07:32.349 --> 01:07:34.516
Alex, wake up!

01:07:34.518 --> 01:07:36.284
Alex. Hey.

01:07:37.453 --> 01:07:38.520
Wake up.

01:07:40.523 --> 01:07:42.190
Alex.

01:07:42.192 --> 01:07:44.159
Hey, Alex!

01:07:58.441 --> 01:08:00.775
All right, let's find
you some clothes.

01:08:03.179 --> 01:08:05.513
I don't... credit cards?

01:08:05.515 --> 01:08:08.116
What do you mean you
don't take credit cards?

01:08:08.118 --> 01:08:10.285
There are homeless people
WHO take credit cards.

01:08:10.287 --> 01:08:12.754
I don't have
one of them machines.

01:08:12.756 --> 01:08:16.224
WHO carries around $600
on their person in cash?

01:08:16.225 --> 01:08:18.560
Somebody that wants their
damn rental truck back.

01:08:18.562 --> 01:08:21.529
That's WHO, smart-ass.

01:08:21.531 --> 01:08:24.799
All right.

01:08:24.801 --> 01:08:26.468
This is my business card.

01:08:26.470 --> 01:08:29.104
Call me.
I'll send you cash.

01:08:29.106 --> 01:08:31.238
I'll send you check,
whatever you want, ok?

01:08:31.241 --> 01:08:32.506
I'M gonna give you
my driver's license.

01:08:32.509 --> 01:08:34.309
Write down the number
on the back.

01:08:34.310 --> 01:08:35.810
What good is that gonna do,
your driver's license...

01:08:35.812 --> 01:08:37.412
Well, IF I don't
give you the money,

01:08:37.413 --> 01:08:38.680
you can call the cops
or something!

01:08:38.682 --> 01:08:41.349
I don't want to call
the cops, shit-wad.

01:08:41.350 --> 01:08:42.884
All right.
What are you, nuts?

01:08:44.752 --> 01:08:46.787
Sir, listen to me, please,

01:08:46.790 --> 01:08:48.288
man to man.

01:08:48.291 --> 01:08:50.725
I really, really, really
need to get home.

01:08:50.727 --> 01:08:52.760
I have a family emergency,

01:08:52.761 --> 01:08:54.629
and I have to leave
this place, ok,

01:08:54.631 --> 01:08:57.499
so you and I are going to
have to figure something out.

01:08:57.501 --> 01:08:59.200
Please.

01:08:59.202 --> 01:09:01.202
Pretty please
with sugar on top?

01:09:01.203 --> 01:09:04.572
Pretty please
with sugar on top.

01:09:08.344 --> 01:09:12.180
You could, uh,
show me your cock.

01:09:13.249 --> 01:09:14.849
I'M sorry, what...

01:09:14.850 --> 01:09:16.451
cock?

01:09:21.857 --> 01:09:23.591
Better?

01:09:23.593 --> 01:09:25.292
Take IT out.

01:09:25.295 --> 01:09:27.662
Show me what you got
under there.

01:09:27.663 --> 01:09:30.532
How 'bout I just
describe IT to you?

01:09:30.533 --> 01:09:31.654
Drop your drawers, sunshine.

01:09:33.403 --> 01:09:35.270
It's the only way out.

01:09:37.173 --> 01:09:38.840
Let me see the keys first.

01:09:56.859 --> 01:09:59.260
Holy crap.

01:09:59.262 --> 01:10:01.196
That's a punisher.

01:10:01.198 --> 01:10:02.730
Thank you.

01:10:02.732 --> 01:10:04.332
Hey, man, so...

01:10:04.334 --> 01:10:07.535
uh, what the hell, dude?!

01:10:07.537 --> 01:10:09.237
Go!
We gotta go!

01:10:09.239 --> 01:10:10.838
What is happening?!
Go! Go!

01:10:10.840 --> 01:10:13.308
Why are you showing
the giant your penis?

01:10:13.310 --> 01:10:14.842
Get out of here,
you sodomites...

01:10:14.844 --> 01:10:17.312
Alex! Alex!
Before I call the cops!

01:10:17.314 --> 01:10:18.947
Alex!
Alex!

01:10:18.949 --> 01:10:20.782
Run!

01:10:20.784 --> 01:10:21.883
We need to go now!

01:10:21.885 --> 01:10:23.685
What happened?
What was that, man?

01:10:23.687 --> 01:10:24.953
What was that?
We gotta go!

01:10:25.956 --> 01:10:27.488
What the fuck?

01:10:27.490 --> 01:10:28.823
God!
Why'd I run?

01:10:28.825 --> 01:10:30.592
Nothing happened.

01:10:30.594 --> 01:10:32.393
Nothing happened?
Nothing happened.

01:10:32.395 --> 01:10:34.362
You were showing him
your dick, man.

01:10:34.364 --> 01:10:35.763
What?
Ok, IT was his idea.

01:10:35.765 --> 01:10:37.765
I wasn't... like,
I had no payment.

01:10:37.767 --> 01:10:38.766
Maybe here's my dick.

01:10:38.768 --> 01:10:39.867
IT wasn't me.

01:10:39.869 --> 01:10:42.237
He said he wanted
to see my dick.

01:10:42.239 --> 01:10:44.505
You don't just
show him your dick.

01:10:44.507 --> 01:10:45.740
He asked to see my dick!

01:10:45.742 --> 01:10:48.810
I showed him my dick
for you guys.

01:10:48.812 --> 01:10:49.911
What? Uhh.

01:10:49.913 --> 01:10:51.479
I showed off my dick
for you guys.

01:10:55.851 --> 01:10:57.819
What was that?
What was what?

01:10:59.355 --> 01:11:00.521
That.
You hear that, right?

01:11:00.523 --> 01:11:01.856
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I don't hear IT.

01:11:01.858 --> 01:11:03.691
Oh, my God.
What?

01:11:03.693 --> 01:11:05.760
All my stuff's
all over the street.

01:11:05.762 --> 01:11:07.662
All my stuff's falling out
of the cab right now.

01:11:07.664 --> 01:11:08.930
Pull over.
Pull over.

01:11:08.932 --> 01:11:10.865
Ok, all right.
Hold on. Hold on.

01:11:10.867 --> 01:11:11.933
Stop!

01:11:28.384 --> 01:11:30.618
- It's all right, man.
- We can pick IT up.

01:11:32.421 --> 01:11:34.455
Ah, ok.
Oh.

01:11:34.457 --> 01:11:36.924
You packed that one.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:11:39.629 --> 01:11:42.063
There goes Lionel Richie.

01:11:43.533 --> 01:11:45.300
Would have wanted
to go this way, I think.

01:11:45.302 --> 01:11:46.334
Fuck!

01:11:46.336 --> 01:11:49.504
You ok?

01:11:49.506 --> 01:11:50.672
How's IT going, buddy?

01:11:50.674 --> 01:11:52.373
We're gonna
figure this out, ok?

01:11:52.375 --> 01:11:53.374
Let's get all of IT.

01:11:53.376 --> 01:11:54.475
Not some of IT.

01:11:54.477 --> 01:11:56.477
Let's get all of IT.

01:11:59.014 --> 01:12:00.982
We're gonna...

01:12:03.886 --> 01:12:06.087
Alex, It's ok, man,
It's just stuff.

01:12:06.089 --> 01:12:07.555
You can replace IT.

01:12:07.557 --> 01:12:09.090
We'll get more.

01:12:11.060 --> 01:12:13.461
That's doing ok.

01:12:13.463 --> 01:12:15.630
See?
It's not all bad.

01:12:17.733 --> 01:12:19.934
Ah, shit.

01:12:31.080 --> 01:12:32.714
That's all my stuff.

01:12:32.716 --> 01:12:34.449
Looks like shit, dude.

01:12:34.451 --> 01:12:36.417
Don't worry.
We'll get IT all.

01:12:37.487 --> 01:12:39.620
You start.

01:12:39.622 --> 01:12:41.589
What?! Why?

01:12:41.591 --> 01:12:43.524
Screw you.

01:12:43.526 --> 01:12:46.694
WHO's gon... WHO's
gonna clean this up?

01:12:46.696 --> 01:12:48.629
Ohh.
Oh, fuck.

01:12:48.631 --> 01:12:50.398
This is gonna take a while.

01:12:55.671 --> 01:12:57.872
No, I, uh...

01:12:57.874 --> 01:13:00.007
Failed the bar exam again.

01:13:00.009 --> 01:13:03.778
Again!

01:13:10.819 --> 01:13:15.590
Man, I thought that three
times was the charm.

01:13:20.396 --> 01:13:23.931
Now I've been filing,

01:13:23.933 --> 01:13:25.800
fucking filing.

01:13:25.802 --> 01:13:29.737
16 months,
tax records and shit.

01:13:29.739 --> 01:13:32.807
Heh.

01:13:32.809 --> 01:13:34.709
They think I'M a joke.

01:13:36.412 --> 01:13:39.013
They, uh...
they laugh at me.

01:13:41.550 --> 01:13:43.184
I know they...
I know they do.

01:13:45.721 --> 01:13:47.989
I mean, I know.
I know I never...

01:13:47.991 --> 01:13:50.558
I never made IT
out of law school.

01:13:52.594 --> 01:13:53.895
But I tried.

01:13:53.897 --> 01:13:56.197
I tried so hard. I...

01:13:56.199 --> 01:13:57.899
I worked on IT.

01:14:00.602 --> 01:14:03.905
Just I don't know WHO I'M
doing this for anymore.

01:14:11.046 --> 01:14:13.548
I want to start over.

01:14:26.628 --> 01:14:29.664
Son of a fuck.

01:14:29.666 --> 01:14:32.600
Hey, officer.

01:14:32.602 --> 01:14:34.569
Hi.

01:14:34.571 --> 01:14:35.970
Fuck! What the...

01:14:35.972 --> 01:14:37.672
why didn't you fucking
get rid of IT, man?

01:14:37.674 --> 01:14:39.040
Where would I get rid of IT at?

01:14:39.042 --> 01:14:40.775
Where would I do that at?

01:14:40.777 --> 01:14:42.543
Just throw IT in a river or something.
I don't know.

01:14:42.545 --> 01:14:43.744
What river you talking about?

01:14:43.746 --> 01:14:44.812
We're in a desert
environment here.

01:14:44.814 --> 01:14:45.947
I'M not Tony fucking soprano.

01:14:45.949 --> 01:14:47.114
I didn't know your shit

01:14:47.116 --> 01:14:48.816
was gonna dump out
all over the place.

01:14:48.818 --> 01:14:50.618
"Hold on to this.
This'll be a good idea."

01:14:50.620 --> 01:14:51.953
Fuck. We're gonna
call your dad, dude.

01:14:51.955 --> 01:14:53.654
He's gonna get us
out of this, ok?

01:14:53.656 --> 01:14:55.223
We can call your dad, right?

01:14:55.225 --> 01:14:57.592
Let's just not call anyone
IF we don't have to, ok?

01:14:57.594 --> 01:14:59.927
Really? Then how the fuck are
we gonna get out of this?

01:14:59.929 --> 01:15:02.964
Hey, I said keep IT
quiet in here.

01:15:02.966 --> 01:15:04.532
Sorry.
Sorry.

01:15:11.740 --> 01:15:13.274
All right, fine.

01:15:13.276 --> 01:15:15.076
Play dumb.

01:15:15.078 --> 01:15:17.578
I'll just charge all
three of you, then.

01:15:17.580 --> 01:15:20.214
Felony possession.

01:15:20.216 --> 01:15:22.283
Concealing an
unregistered firearm

01:15:22.285 --> 01:15:26.621
in a commercial vehicle
carries a minimum sentence.

01:15:28.824 --> 01:15:33.094
And the judge usually likes
to leave early on Fridays,

01:15:33.096 --> 01:15:36.764
so, uh, you fellas
probably won't even

01:15:36.766 --> 01:15:40.167
be able to post bail until...

01:15:40.169 --> 01:15:41.903
Monday now.

01:15:45.173 --> 01:15:46.674
Please don't do this.

01:15:46.676 --> 01:15:48.910
Please.

01:15:48.912 --> 01:15:50.311
It's mine.

01:15:53.015 --> 01:15:55.016
Gun belongs to me.

01:15:55.018 --> 01:15:56.884
Bullets, too.

01:15:56.886 --> 01:15:58.185
Good.

01:15:58.187 --> 01:16:00.821
See how easy that was?

01:16:02.724 --> 01:16:04.725
Hey, you guys can
post my bail, right?

01:16:04.727 --> 01:16:06.694
Right?

01:16:09.031 --> 01:16:12.934
Officer, wait.

01:16:12.936 --> 01:16:14.936
The gun is mine.

01:16:16.004 --> 01:16:18.205
You guys trying
to be smart with me?

01:16:18.207 --> 01:16:20.708
Is that what this is? Because
I'll just book both of you.

01:16:21.945 --> 01:16:24.111
Ethan, what kind of gun is IT?

01:16:24.113 --> 01:16:26.213
It's a handgun.

01:16:26.215 --> 01:16:28.316
Yeah. What kind?

01:16:28.318 --> 01:16:31.852
It's a...
Six-shooter?

01:16:31.854 --> 01:16:35.590
It's a colt 1911 standard
issue marine sidearm,

01:16:35.592 --> 01:16:40.161
serial number
usmc, number 8986771.

01:16:43.665 --> 01:16:47.001
And what are you doing
with a gun like this?

01:16:48.770 --> 01:16:50.838
I took IT.

01:16:54.843 --> 01:16:56.877
Dad.

01:16:56.879 --> 01:16:58.813
Alexander?
Where are you?

01:16:58.815 --> 01:17:00.081
At the sheriff's station.

01:17:00.083 --> 01:17:01.282
They found something.

01:17:03.151 --> 01:17:04.652
Have you said anything?

01:17:04.654 --> 01:17:06.220
I don't think so.

01:17:06.222 --> 01:17:09.090
Good. Just keep your mouth
shut until I can send someone.

01:17:10.993 --> 01:17:12.760
No.

01:17:16.732 --> 01:17:19.734
No, I'M taking the
responsibility for IT this time.

01:17:19.736 --> 01:17:22.103
I'M gonna let them book me,

01:17:22.105 --> 01:17:24.372
and I'll deal with the
consequences myself.

01:17:24.374 --> 01:17:27.008
And why would you do that?

01:17:27.010 --> 01:17:29.176
Because I, uh...

01:17:29.178 --> 01:17:31.646
you know I can't have this
anymore, Alexander.

01:17:31.648 --> 01:17:33.781
Are you trying
to make a deal with me?

01:17:35.217 --> 01:17:37.018
No. No, I'M not,

01:17:37.020 --> 01:17:40.021
but IF that's the way
you need to see IT...

01:17:40.023 --> 01:17:41.155
no deals.

01:17:41.157 --> 01:17:42.890
We've been through this before.

01:17:42.892 --> 01:17:44.425
I can't trust you anymore.

01:17:44.427 --> 01:17:46.293
Yeah, I know that.
I know that, dad.

01:17:48.864 --> 01:17:49.997
I'M sorry.

01:17:49.999 --> 01:17:51.932
Alexander, you need
to listen to me.

01:17:57.106 --> 01:17:59.073
I'M ready.

01:17:59.075 --> 01:18:01.342
Dude, stop futzing
with that thing.

01:18:01.344 --> 01:18:02.376
It's really fucking tight.

01:18:02.378 --> 01:18:04.145
You're not gonna defeat IT.

01:18:04.147 --> 01:18:06.881
It's a little uncomfortable.

01:18:06.883 --> 01:18:08.783
I don't know IF you've noticed.

01:18:08.785 --> 01:18:10.117
Six-shooter? Really?

01:18:10.119 --> 01:18:11.385
That was your best guess?

01:18:11.387 --> 01:18:13.220
That was a high-pressure
situation in there.

01:18:13.222 --> 01:18:15.389
I WAS a little bit
fucking nervous.

01:18:15.391 --> 01:18:17.024
I thought I WAS
going to prison, man.

01:18:17.026 --> 01:18:18.726
Dude, you would not
do well in prison.

01:18:18.728 --> 01:18:19.860
No, I would not.
Oh, my God.

01:18:19.862 --> 01:18:21.362
Or you would,
depending on what kind

01:18:21.364 --> 01:18:23.030
of experience
you're looking for.

01:18:24.901 --> 01:18:27.702
I'M sorry I got you
into this, man.

01:18:27.704 --> 01:18:29.403
Don't be.
I'M glad I'M here.

01:18:29.405 --> 01:18:31.706
Well, not here exactly,

01:18:31.708 --> 01:18:33.407
but you know what I mean.

01:18:33.409 --> 01:18:35.376
He could have
really hurt himself.

01:18:36.912 --> 01:18:38.279
Or worse.

01:18:40.882 --> 01:18:44.719
I'M sorry that you missed
your, uh, anniversary trip.

01:18:44.721 --> 01:18:48.222
Shireen is leaving me, I think,

01:18:48.224 --> 01:18:49.990
as we speak.

01:18:49.992 --> 01:18:51.926
No. I thought
that you said...

01:18:51.928 --> 01:18:54.128
I know what I said.
I'M sorry.

01:18:54.130 --> 01:18:56.464
Shit. Dude, what am I gonna do?

01:18:56.466 --> 01:18:58.733
Get a fucking divorce?

01:18:58.735 --> 01:19:00.034
Live alone again?

01:19:00.036 --> 01:19:02.303
I can't do any of these things.

01:19:02.305 --> 01:19:04.505
Oh, why not, man?
This might be a great thing.

01:19:04.507 --> 01:19:06.974
She's never been
all that nice to you.

01:19:06.976 --> 01:19:08.943
Yeah.

01:19:10.378 --> 01:19:12.213
But she's my wife...

01:19:13.215 --> 01:19:15.382
And I love her.

01:19:16.518 --> 01:19:18.519
Well, I think you just answered

01:19:18.521 --> 01:19:20.387
your own question there, Reza.

01:19:22.791 --> 01:19:25.259
That is why I called you, man.

01:19:25.261 --> 01:19:26.494
Why is that?

01:19:26.496 --> 01:19:28.162
Because I knew you'd come.

01:19:28.164 --> 01:19:29.497
Oh.

01:19:29.499 --> 01:19:32.767
And because I miss my friend.

01:19:33.869 --> 01:19:35.936
I'M sorry I've been such a dick

01:19:35.938 --> 01:19:37.338
these last couple of days.

01:19:37.340 --> 01:19:40.341
I, uh... I didn't know
what was going on with you,

01:19:40.343 --> 01:19:43.210
and I'M pissed off about the
way that my life is headed.

01:19:43.212 --> 01:19:45.312
Dude, I didn't mean any
of those things I said.

01:19:45.314 --> 01:19:46.781
No, you did, but It's ok,

01:19:46.783 --> 01:19:49.216
really, because I needed
to fucking hear IT.

01:19:49.218 --> 01:19:50.985
I made some weird choices,

01:19:50.987 --> 01:19:53.053
you know, some good, some bad,

01:19:53.055 --> 01:19:56.290
but I don't know. Now I gotta
live with IT, you know.

01:19:56.292 --> 01:19:58.292
But as long
as I go with the flow,

01:19:58.294 --> 01:19:59.894
I think I'M gonna
be fine, right?

01:19:59.896 --> 01:20:02.263
I'll be fine, right?

01:20:02.265 --> 01:20:03.264
Right?

01:20:03.266 --> 01:20:04.799
Yeah.

01:20:04.801 --> 01:20:07.868
Look, you don't
have to answer this,

01:20:07.870 --> 01:20:12.306
but where did you get
that particular gun?

01:20:13.809 --> 01:20:15.442
My dad.

01:20:15.444 --> 01:20:17.845
He was a marine,

01:20:17.847 --> 01:20:19.914
kept IT in his desk.

01:20:19.916 --> 01:20:22.516
First division myself,

01:20:22.518 --> 01:20:24.552
armored reconnaissance.

01:20:24.554 --> 01:20:27.888
Third division,
fourth regiment,

01:20:27.890 --> 01:20:30.257
combat assault battalion,

01:20:30.259 --> 01:20:33.194
two tours in Vietnam.

01:20:34.396 --> 01:20:36.363
My friends were
simply escorting me

01:20:36.365 --> 01:20:38.399
to the serenity woods
rehab center,

01:20:38.401 --> 01:20:41.502
where I'M due to check in now.

01:20:42.604 --> 01:20:45.239
I mean, you can
call them IF you want.

01:20:49.344 --> 01:20:51.045
He's been in there a while.

01:20:51.047 --> 01:20:52.112
You think he's ok?

01:20:52.114 --> 01:20:53.914
It's not the first time.

01:20:53.916 --> 01:20:55.349
Remember 11th grade.

01:20:57.887 --> 01:21:01.322
Mr. Hamilton will pull
some strings, right?

01:21:03.158 --> 01:21:05.392
Yeah, ok, thanks.

01:21:10.165 --> 01:21:13.100
You were expected yesterday.

01:21:13.102 --> 01:21:15.469
Yeah, we had some problems.

01:21:16.872 --> 01:21:21.442
Listen, son,
this is an opportunity

01:21:21.444 --> 01:21:23.444
for you to get
your life in order.

01:21:23.446 --> 01:21:26.280
I hope you make the most of IT.

01:21:42.565 --> 01:21:45.900
"Hope" is an optimistic word.

01:22:03.184 --> 01:22:05.085
Where we going?

01:23:49.691 --> 01:23:50.791
We here?

01:23:57.565 --> 01:23:59.066
Yeah, IT looks nice.

01:24:00.602 --> 01:24:02.636
I-I'd totally
live here.

01:24:02.638 --> 01:24:04.438
Right? I would absolutely...

01:24:04.440 --> 01:24:06.774
I kind of envy you right now.

01:24:09.311 --> 01:24:11.211
I guess I better
check myself in.

01:24:11.213 --> 01:24:13.313
I think these places
charge by the day.

01:24:13.315 --> 01:24:14.748
Alex, this is the
right thing, man.

01:24:16.785 --> 01:24:18.085
You be good.

01:24:26.728 --> 01:24:28.495
I'll get you back
for that bond.

01:24:28.497 --> 01:24:30.297
Don't worry about IT, man.

01:24:33.435 --> 01:24:35.736
Oh, and...

01:24:35.738 --> 01:24:38.205
I won't say anything
about the mechanic.

01:24:38.207 --> 01:24:40.240
Y-you just did.

01:24:40.242 --> 01:24:41.375
Just did.

01:24:44.212 --> 01:24:47.081
You guys know I wouldn't
have done this by myself.

01:24:52.720 --> 01:24:54.321
Hey.

01:25:14.677 --> 01:25:16.643
You love him.
You love him.

01:25:16.645 --> 01:25:18.345
He's fine. He's fine.

01:25:42.170 --> 01:25:43.904
Can I help you?

01:25:49.644 --> 01:25:50.711
I hope so.

01:25:52.780 --> 01:25:54.414
Come in.

01:26:22.577 --> 01:26:24.478
It's a nice place, man.

01:26:24.480 --> 01:26:25.746
Yeah.

01:26:27.215 --> 01:26:29.483
Hey, why don't you come
and stay the night?

01:26:29.485 --> 01:26:30.951
God, you know what?
Thank you.

01:26:30.953 --> 01:26:34.221
I'd love to, but I, uh,
I'M gonna try to make IT

01:26:34.223 --> 01:26:38.425
back to Los Angeles before
that farmers market closes.

01:26:38.427 --> 01:26:41.295
I fucking understand.

01:26:42.430 --> 01:26:43.964
But we did IT, though, right?

01:26:43.966 --> 01:26:45.365
Fucking "a," man.

01:26:45.367 --> 01:26:46.934
I couldn't have
done IT without you.

01:26:46.936 --> 01:26:48.435
Oh, I know that.

01:26:50.371 --> 01:26:53.640
I didn't want things
to get this way between us.

01:26:53.642 --> 01:26:54.808
Yeah, me neither, man.

01:26:54.810 --> 01:26:57.377
Me neither.

01:26:59.314 --> 01:27:03.417
So what are you gonna do?

01:27:03.419 --> 01:27:05.752
Well, first I'M probably
gonna do laundry.

01:27:05.754 --> 01:27:07.321
Oh, yeah, that's appropriate.

01:27:07.323 --> 01:27:11.491
And then I'M gonna try
and save my marriage.

01:27:11.493 --> 01:27:13.460
I'M glad to hear IT.

01:27:21.703 --> 01:27:24.471
Hey, you were great last night.

01:27:26.007 --> 01:27:28.542
Thanks, Rez. Thanks.

01:27:28.544 --> 01:27:32.813
Good luck with, um, you know,

01:27:32.815 --> 01:27:34.581
whatever you do.
