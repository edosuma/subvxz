[TV: Organ]

00:09.000 --> 00:11.300
Boo!

00:11.300 --> 00:13.900
Damn it, Fez!
[Sighs]

00:13.900 --> 00:16.700
Oh! Damn, Fez.

00:16.600 --> 00:18.400
Fez, what the hell are you doing?

00:18.400 --> 00:20.400
Yeah, I don't know
if you know this...

00:20.300 --> 00:22.300
but you're dressed like a girl.

00:22.300 --> 00:24.600
And not a nice girl.

00:25.800 --> 00:28.400
Kelso, you spilled juice
all over your shirt.

00:28.300 --> 00:30.600
- You look stupid.
- [Eric] Yeah.

00:30.600 --> 00:34.700
Hey, Kelso, while you're over there, would
you Please, Please toss Fez a Pair of Pants?

00:34.700 --> 00:36.600
Or at least a skirt.

00:36.600 --> 00:40.500
No, I am Dr. Frank-N-Furter from
The Rocky Horror Picture Show.

00:40.400 --> 00:44.700
You know, my Bible-thumping host
parents were really upset about my...

00:44.600 --> 00:46.800
rock-hard ass.

00:46.800 --> 00:49.600
Fez, put it away
or take it outside.

00:50.800 --> 00:52.800
So, Eric, do you wanna
get out of here?

00:52.800 --> 00:55.600
- Do something fun for Halloween?
- I do.

00:55.500 --> 00:59.500
I gotta go to this stupid Halloween party
with Laurie's stupid friends.

00:59.400 --> 01:01.700
Not only do I have to
wear a suit...

01:01.700 --> 01:04.500
but all of her guy friends act
like they've done it with her before.

01:04.500 --> 01:06.600
- Uh, Kelso-
- Leave it.

01:06.600 --> 01:09.400
Okay. Whatever.
There's nothing to do.

01:09.400 --> 01:12.700
It's like we're too old to trick
or treat and too young to die.

01:12.600 --> 01:16.400
Oh, hey, we could take Fez to Chicago
and peddle his ass for beer.

01:16.400 --> 01:19.200
I'm game.

01:19.200 --> 01:24.600
No, Eric, I meant maybe there's something,
you know, we could do. Together.

01:24.300 --> 01:26.900
- [Snorts] I doubt it.
- Oh!

01:26.900 --> 01:30.200
That is a burn.

01:30.100 --> 01:32.000
- Wait. What?
- No, l-

01:32.000 --> 01:34.100
No, I didn't- I didn't
mean it like that.

01:34.100 --> 01:36.400
Nope, sorry, Eric,
that was a burn.

01:36.400 --> 01:39.400
And what's burnt is burnt.
And what's burnt is Donna.

01:39.300 --> 01:42.300
We're out of fun things to do?
You're already bored of your girlfriend?

01:42.300 --> 01:44.600
No, I meant this town...

01:44.600 --> 01:47.300
not you, pretty lady.

01:47.300 --> 01:49.300
Hey, you know what'd be fun?

01:49.200 --> 01:51.700
Is if we were in an Alfred
Hitchcock movie right now...

01:51.700 --> 01:54.000
and we didn't know it,
and then someone told us...

01:54.000 --> 01:56.700
and we're like,
"Oh, man, I'm in a movie."

02:01.000 --> 02:03.800
- Yeah, okay, I'm outta here.
- Wait, but I thought we-

02:03.800 --> 02:05.600
- Get bent.
- Okay, I'll do that.

02:05.600 --> 02:10.000
You know what will cheer you up?
A little trick-or-treating.

02:09.900 --> 02:13.700
Hello? Stop bouncing that damn
ball and let's do something.

02:15.000 --> 02:18.000
Yeah, you know, I can't, Fez,
'cause I can't even look at you.

02:17.900 --> 02:20.400
I don't know whether to
throw you out or...

02:20.400 --> 02:23.100
throw you down and
make sweet love to you.

02:23.100 --> 02:26.200
You know, that says more
about you than it does him.

02:26.200 --> 02:29.000
Well, I'm not the one
dressed like a damn girl.

02:28.900 --> 02:32.400
Well, the damn girl has your ball.
[Chuckles]

02:33.700 --> 02:36.200
- Like I care about a-
- [TV: Organ]

02:36.200 --> 02:38.800
Man, that's my ball.

02:49.400 --> 02:51.900
Oh, these heels are killing me.

02:54.200 --> 02:59.100
Okay, Fez, that's it. Give the ball back,
and no one gets hurt.

02:59.000 --> 03:01.000
- [Grunts]
- [Screams]

03:04.500 --> 03:07.500
Hey, you guys, you wanna go outside
and watch Eric and Fez run around?

03:07.400 --> 03:11.800
Someone might get hurt.
It's funny when people get hurt.

03:11.700 --> 03:15.300
Especially when they're
in their underwear. That's great.

03:15.200 --> 03:17.600
The only person dumb enough
to get hurt around here is you.

03:17.600 --> 03:20.500
[Snorts] Okay, Jackie,
I'm really starting to get sick-

03:20.500 --> 03:23.500
[Screaming]

03:27.600 --> 03:29.700
That's great.

03:31.200 --> 03:33.500
I'll give you the ball,
Eric. Just don't fall.

03:33.500 --> 03:36.200
I don't want anyone to fall.
No falling.

03:36.200 --> 03:38.900
[Screams, Grunts]

03:41.900 --> 03:44.400
Hangin'out

03:45.900 --> 03:47.800
Down the street

03:49.400 --> 03:51.400
The same old thing

03:53.100 --> 03:55.100
We did last week

03:56.100 --> 03:59.900
Not a thing to do

03:59.900 --> 04:03.200
But talk to you

04:03.100 --> 04:05.500
We're all all right

04:05.400 --> 04:07.400
We're all all right

04:07.400 --> 04:09.900
Hello, Wisconsin.!

04:16.100 --> 04:18.500
Okay, Fez. Well...

04:18.500 --> 04:20.800
you got a bad sprain here.

04:20.800 --> 04:25.000
Not to- to mention a run in your stocking.
[Laughs]

04:24.900 --> 04:28.100
So, you were running around
chasing him on the roof...

04:28.100 --> 04:30.800
because he took
your little rubber ball.

04:30.700 --> 04:33.900
It wasn't a ball.
It was a SuperBall.

04:33.800 --> 04:35.700
Yeah, you should see
that thing bounce.

04:35.700 --> 04:37.600
It's pretty super.

04:37.500 --> 04:39.700
Dumb-asses.

04:39.700 --> 04:42.200
Steven, Eric, um, get Fez a blanket.

04:42.000 --> 04:44.400
He needs to cover his- He just-

04:44.300 --> 04:46.400
He needs to cover up.

04:50.600 --> 04:54.100
[Gasping]

04:53.900 --> 04:58.200
[Screaming]

05:00.100 --> 05:02.100
Get off me, you girl.

05:03.200 --> 05:06.700
- What-What happened?
- Honey, you just-

05:06.600 --> 05:09.100
you had a little touch
of vertigo there.

05:09.000 --> 05:12.900
So, just stay away from heights
for a while and you'll be fine.

05:12.900 --> 05:15.300
Oh, see?
You see that, Jackie?

05:15.300 --> 05:17.600
Fez hurt himself. There is
someone "stupider" than me.

05:17.500 --> 05:20.100
It's not his fault
he's stupid. He's foreign.

05:20.000 --> 05:22.900
What's your excuse, stupid?

05:22.900 --> 05:26.400
Well, I know one thing's for sure. There's
definitely someone bitchier than me.

05:26.400 --> 05:28.300
Oh, you better not mean me.

05:28.300 --> 05:32.400
Oh, I so mean you!

05:32.200 --> 05:34.400
- Oh.
- Nice burn.

05:34.300 --> 05:36.600
- Top shelf.
- Thanks.

05:36.600 --> 05:39.200
Well, now, that's strange.

05:39.200 --> 05:42.100
Midge's car's right there.
Bob said she wasn't home.

05:42.100 --> 05:44.100
In fact, I haven't
seen her for days.

05:44.000 --> 05:47.100
Maybe she went to the store
and forgot where she lived.

05:49.400 --> 05:51.500
Oh, that's- that's wrong.

05:51.500 --> 05:54.500
Okay, Fez, this'll cheer you up.

05:54.400 --> 05:57.400
With these you can look into the
Pinciotti's house and frequently enjoy...

05:57.400 --> 06:00.900
a naked Midge,
up close and personal.

06:00.800 --> 06:03.400
That's exactly how I like
my naked Midges.

06:03.300 --> 06:05.300
Oh, but, Fez, be warned.

06:05.200 --> 06:08.200
If Bob approaches
a naked Midge, look away.

06:08.200 --> 06:11.100
Oh, for the love of God,
look away.

06:11.000 --> 06:13.000
Okay, let's practice.

06:12.900 --> 06:14.900
Naked Midge, naked Midge,
naked Midge...

06:14.800 --> 06:16.800
- naked Midge, Bob.
- Ay.

06:16.700 --> 06:20.200
- Okay, I think you're gonna be okay.
- [Chuckles]

06:20.200 --> 06:23.200
No, okay. Sure.
Yeah. Bye-bye.

06:23.100 --> 06:26.400
Red, I need you to take
this soup up to Fez.

06:26.300 --> 06:28.800
No, Kitty. He's wearing
ladies' underwear.

06:28.800 --> 06:30.800
So, uh, no.

06:31.800 --> 06:34.300
Well, crazy bird lady
from next door called me.

06:34.300 --> 06:37.000
Her bingo cruise got stuck
out on Lake Michigan...

06:36.900 --> 06:38.900
so she asked me
to feed her birds.

06:38.800 --> 06:42.900
So, you have a choice.
Feed the birds, or feed the Fez.

06:45.000 --> 06:47.500
Give me panty boy's damn soup.

06:50.000 --> 06:53.000
Hello, pretty birds.

06:53.000 --> 06:55.200
Hello, pretty...

06:55.200 --> 06:58.100
damn big birds.
[Chuckles]

06:58.000 --> 07:00.500
It's your Aunt Kitty.

07:00.400 --> 07:02.300
Okay.

07:03.100 --> 07:05.700
[Squawks]

07:05.700 --> 07:07.600
[Gasps]

07:19.700 --> 07:22.600
[Cawing]

07:24.900 --> 07:27.700
[Cawing Continues]

07:31.800 --> 07:33.800
Hey.

07:37.000 --> 07:39.000
Oh, I've
