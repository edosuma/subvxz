WEBVTT

00:04.553 --> 00:06.428
Previously on <i>Billions...</i>

00:06.512 --> 00:08.970
The case you'll be bringing is:
Obstruction of justice.

00:09.053 --> 00:11.261
Against the Attorney General.

00:11.345 --> 00:14.470
We need the icebreaker now.
We need Grigor Andolov.

00:14.553 --> 00:15.929
International criminals
are unstable bedrock

00:16.011 --> 00:17.887
for a cap raise.

00:17.970 --> 00:19.553
You don't think taking his money
was at least worth a discussion?

00:19.637 --> 00:20.929
There was a discussion.

00:21.011 --> 00:22.970
He said I was
off the raise team.

00:24.178 --> 00:25.637
This is an object lesson.

00:25.720 --> 00:29.512
It's time to put away
childish enthusiasms.

00:29.595 --> 00:31.720
I don't even know
that it's wrong for him

00:31.804 --> 00:33.387
to do what he's doing...

00:33.470 --> 00:35.762
only that I don't like
how it makes me feel.

00:35.845 --> 00:37.762
Boss...
Mick Danzig just quit.

00:37.845 --> 00:39.929
Jack.
No.

00:40.011 --> 00:42.303
Yes, Jack.

00:42.387 --> 00:44.345
I know that you have
built a good chunk

00:44.428 --> 00:46.178
of your fortune
on cheap steel deals.

00:46.261 --> 00:49.053
It's not only illegal,
it's fucking dangerous.

00:49.136 --> 00:51.095
But if you imagine
this is the first time

00:51.178 --> 00:54.011
I've ever had to wrestle
with my shoulders near the mat,

00:54.095 --> 00:55.929
you're gonna learn
something very different.

00:56.011 --> 01:00.095
We. Fucking. Did it!

01:00.178 --> 01:03.261
Six billion dollars committed.

01:03.345 --> 01:04.804
I've been making
follow-up calls to book

01:04.887 --> 01:06.428
the money that
was pledged at the raise.

01:06.512 --> 01:08.595
I'm having problems
locking it in.

01:08.679 --> 01:11.345
It looks like you're
ready to get into business.

01:11.428 --> 01:13.136
I need a meeting
with your boss, Grigor Andolov.

01:13.220 --> 01:16.011
I will pull all my money,

01:16.095 --> 01:18.095
and I will give it to Taylor.

01:18.178 --> 01:20.303
A new kind of organization.

01:20.387 --> 01:22.136
And you can make more
than you do now.

01:22.220 --> 01:23.637
With a partnership stake.

01:23.720 --> 01:26.804
You've stolen from me.
And you've betrayed me.

01:26.887 --> 01:28.387
- Alvin?
- We got him.

01:28.470 --> 01:30.345
It worked.
I can play you the tape.

01:30.428 --> 01:32.720
The fellas told me
what you had in store for me.

01:32.804 --> 01:36.470
You, Charles Rhoades Junior,
are relieved of duty.

01:36.553 --> 01:38.804
On power of the President,
you are fired!

01:38.887 --> 01:43.428
Get the fuck out of here.

01:43.512 --> 01:46.011
'lo, Bob.
Charles.

01:46.095 --> 01:48.011
So, you know how you're gonna
go after Jock?

01:48.095 --> 01:50.929
Some ideas
floating around my head.

01:51.011 --> 01:52.428
And, uh, Taylor?

01:52.512 --> 01:54.011
Yeah.

01:54.095 --> 01:55.970
Got a plan
that's starting to form.

Hey, Chef Ryan.

04:53.387 --> 04:55.762
I got up early.

04:55.845 --> 04:58.595
Just put that coffee in a go-cup
and get the car brought around.

04:58.679 --> 04:59.720
Man like you
should eat something.

04:59.804 --> 05:01.178
So you have fuel to burn.

05:01.261 --> 05:03.762
Do I look like I need
to fan the fire?

05:11.387 --> 05:14.345
The new, beefed up non-competes.
Ready to be signed.

05:14.428 --> 05:16.804
They better be
iron fucking clad.

05:16.887 --> 05:20.387
Believe me, they're tighter
than AC/DC in '78.

05:45.512 --> 05:47.512
Hmm?

05:47.595 --> 05:48.970
Al Green!

05:49.053 --> 05:51.136
The Reverend.

05:51.220 --> 05:54.095
But this is before that.

05:54.178 --> 05:55.845
Now, this is The Belle Album.

05:55.929 --> 05:58.178
It's considered by many to be
the long player

05:58.261 --> 06:02.220
he made as an apology
and entreaty to Jesus Christ

06:02.303 --> 06:04.178
for the life of the flesh
he had been living

06:04.261 --> 06:05.804
before he joined the ministry.

06:05.887 --> 06:06.887
Is that so?

06:06.970 --> 06:09.095
Indubitably.
Hmm.

06:09.178 --> 06:11.428
Just two years earlier,
he was scalded

06:11.512 --> 06:13.470
when his girlfriend threw
a boiling pot of hot grits

06:13.553 --> 06:16.887
over him
in the midst of a fight.

06:16.970 --> 06:20.804
She felt so bad after, that
she retreated into the bedroom,

06:20.887 --> 06:23.804
picked up his handgun...
His handgun...

06:23.887 --> 06:25.887
And shot herself.

06:25.970 --> 06:27.387
Dead.

06:27.470 --> 06:28.887
Tragic.

06:28.970 --> 06:31.095
Mm.
My guess?

06:31.178 --> 06:32.553
Green never forgave himself

06:32.637 --> 06:35.428
for having that pistol
in the house.

06:35.512 --> 06:36.720
This bullshit is you telling me

06:36.804 --> 06:38.095
you can't get me a gun permit.

06:38.178 --> 06:40.178
No, sir!

06:40.261 --> 06:41.804
It is no small thing to do,

06:41.887 --> 06:44.470
but if that's what's necessary,
I can make it happen.

06:44.553 --> 06:46.929
No, I tell you the story
as a way to communicate

06:47.011 --> 06:49.428
that you shouldn't want
a gun permit.

06:49.512 --> 06:50.929
I don't want one.
I need one.

06:51.011 --> 06:52.553
I'm high profile, I own horses,

06:52.637 --> 06:54.470
I carry cash
to and from the track,

06:54.553 --> 06:55.929
to the garage and back.

06:56.011 --> 06:59.637
My wife, look,
the kid loves jewelry,

06:59.720 --> 07:02.428
I need to know that we can
move freely and safely.

07:02.512 --> 07:06.428
Mr. Brogan, do not get a permit
to carry a handgun.

07:06.512 --> 07:08.428
You asked for my counsel,
that's my counsel.

07:08.512 --> 07:10.136
No. I'm not here
for your counsel.

07:10.220 --> 07:11.345
You're supposed to be
a power broker now, right?

07:11.428 --> 07:13.220
So broker some power.

07:13.303 --> 07:15.804
Tap your relationship
with the Police Commissioner.

07:15.887 --> 07:17.929
Unless, when they canned your
ass, you lost all your pull.

07:18.011 --> 07:19.845
Is that what this is?
Please.

07:19.929 --> 07:21.929
My favor bank is chock-full.

07:23.053 --> 07:26.595
How's this: I happen to have
in my possession,

07:26.679 --> 07:28.637
a Park-Anywhere Permit

07:28.720 --> 07:31.929
direct from the Mayor's Office.

07:32.011 --> 07:34.887
You can pull right up wherever
you're going, nice and safe,

07:34.970 --> 07:36.512
no one will ticket your car.

07:36.595 --> 07:37.887
You park on the sidewalk

07:37.970 --> 07:39.595
and cops will have
to walk around it.

07:39.679 --> 07:41.053
Cops already walk around my car.

07:41.136 --> 07:43.887
I have an ex-cop driving it.

07:43.970 --> 07:46.470
I know a carry permit is
almost impossible in New York.

07:46.553 --> 07:48.929
Yes.
Toughest in the country.

07:49.011 --> 07:51.970
Only ex-cops and ex-feds
gain concealed carry permits

07:52.053 --> 07:55.053
in New York City...
And guys hooked up on high.

07:55.136 --> 07:56.345
Which is what I figured
you were.

07:56.428 --> 07:58.428
But now it's clear, you're not.

08:04.804 --> 08:06.679
Teva's about to announce,
you poised, Dollar Bill?

08:06.762 --> 08:08.679
Aye, Captain.

08:08.762 --> 08:11.220
If América Móvil gets whacked,
the peso goes with it, Ev...

08:11.303 --> 08:12.804
I'm Everready.

08:12.887 --> 08:15.720
Personal foul on the play:
Using your own nickname.

08:15.804 --> 08:18.136
Hey, Rudy, where are you
landing on Rio?

08:18.220 --> 08:20.387
I'm seeing weakness
in Australian ore, so...

08:20.470 --> 08:22.387
You're the only
weakness I'm seeing.

08:22.470 --> 08:23.929
Wait, what?

08:24.011 --> 08:25.553
Over in the kitchen
before the open you said

08:25.637 --> 08:26.679
they were expanding
their rail capacity.

08:26.762 --> 08:28.804
- Yeah.
- So I thought they must be

08:28.887 --> 08:29.845
expanding their CapEx and would
be down for a quarter or two...

08:29.929 --> 08:31.220
That was your mistake: Thinking.

08:31.303 --> 08:32.761
Hey, what's the rumpus?

08:32.845 --> 08:35.095
- I was...
- Nothing.

08:35.178 --> 08:38.178
I want you two in sync
like incestuous ice dancers.

08:38.260 --> 08:40.260
My thong's already
riding up my crack,

08:40.345 --> 08:42.010
I don't need you
up there too, Axe.

08:42.095 --> 08:43.428
Oh, that's exactly where I am.

08:43.511 --> 08:45.178
That goes for all of you.

08:45.261 --> 08:46.762
So give, Bonnie.

08:46.845 --> 08:48.637
Fine.

08:48.720 --> 08:51.428
They're expecting shipments
of 360 million tons.

08:51.512 --> 08:54.178
The information
is fucking out there.

08:58.887 --> 09:02.387
Do you know why
Ovi scores so much?

09:02.470 --> 09:05.512
'Cause Backstrom
shares the puck.

09:05.595 --> 09:08.637
Yeah, but when he does,
Ovi goes bardown.

09:08.720 --> 09:10.595
This lame loses the puck
between his legs,

09:10.679 --> 09:12.804
or airmails it
into the goddamn glass.

09:12.887 --> 09:14.845
So I fire him,
and he never fucks up again...

09:14.929 --> 09:16.845
- Right, Rudy?
- That's right, Axe!

09:16.929 --> 09:18.595
And you signed your non-compete,
didn't you?

09:18.679 --> 09:20.220
Of course!

09:20.303 --> 09:21.512
Good.

09:21.595 --> 09:24.428
Rudy, you're fired.

09:28.929 --> 09:30.512
For,

09:30.595 --> 09:32.387
for misreading
Bonnie's information?

09:32.470 --> 09:36.053
That and for fraternizing.

09:36.136 --> 09:38.679
With our sworn fucking enemies.

09:38.762 --> 09:40.845
Taylor Mason Capital picnic?

09:40.929 --> 09:43.011
I accepted that invitation
a long time ago...

09:43.095 --> 09:44.887
before.

09:44.970 --> 09:47.595
No one talked shop...
Everyone else here declined.

09:47.679 --> 09:50.011
Or didn't even fucking respond.

09:50.095 --> 09:51.762
Public execution.

09:51.845 --> 09:53.136
Power move.

09:53.220 --> 09:55.011
Whose bits aren't hard, huh?

09:55.095 --> 09:56.345
Gross.

09:56.428 --> 09:58.720
This is a new day for Axe Cap,

09:58.804 --> 10:01.345
so we will all share
our information

10:01.428 --> 10:03.095
or we won't be a part of it.

10:03.178 --> 10:05.011
Get with it,
or get fucked, people.

10:05.095 --> 10:07.345
So you're firing me too?
No, he fired you.

10:07.428 --> 10:09.970
I'm seconding it.

10:10.053 --> 10:11.804
Go.

10:14.887 --> 10:17.512
We now live in a universe
split down the middle.

10:17.595 --> 10:19.637
You got to pick sides.

10:19.720 --> 10:22.095
If you're not on mine,
you're gone.

10:22.178 --> 10:24.887
That was bracing.

10:24.970 --> 10:27.053
I'm headed off to the land
of milk and honey.

10:27.136 --> 10:28.512
Or their embassy, at least.

10:28.595 --> 10:29.970
You sure you don't want
to come along

10:30.053 --> 10:31.261
and help me deal with
the sovereign wealth fund?

10:31.345 --> 10:33.220
This is
my sovereign wealth fund.

10:33.303 --> 10:35.512
You really sure you want me
to deal with the royals?

10:35.595 --> 10:38.303
Competition is probably
sending their top dog.

10:38.387 --> 10:41.053
Oh, believe me, they're not
sitting down with Taylor.

10:41.136 --> 10:42.970
They would never see
someone like them.

10:43.053 --> 10:45.345
And the sovereign money
is pledged to us already.

10:45.428 --> 10:46.470
This is just about
setting terms.

10:46.553 --> 10:47.929
But that's the hard part.

10:48.011 --> 10:49.470
Nobody's paying
full freight anymore.

10:49.553 --> 10:51.595
Wags, it's bad enough
that we had to go 2 and 20.

10:51.679 --> 10:53.387
We gotta make our stand there.

10:53.470 --> 10:55.303
We might as well be running
a mutual fund.

10:55.387 --> 10:58.720
You go deliver this message
and get us our terms.

10:58.804 --> 11:01.387
Jawohl, kommandant.
And cut that shit out.

11:01.470 --> 11:04.220
Whatever you say, amigo.

11:04.303 --> 11:07.178
I, Bryan James Flynn Connerty,
do solemnly swear...

11:07.261 --> 11:08.929
That I will support and defend

11:09.011 --> 11:11.512
the Constitution
of the United States...

11:11.595 --> 11:12.970
...that I will support
and defend

11:13.053 --> 11:15.053
the Constitution
of the United States...

11:15.136 --> 11:18.011
...against all enemies,
foreign and domestic.

11:18.095 --> 11:20.929
...against all enemies
foreign and domestic.

11:21.011 --> 11:23.929
Our boy looks good up there,
doesn't he?

11:24.011 --> 11:26.470
Like he was born to it.

11:26.553 --> 11:30.345
No one's born to it,
Ms. Sacker, not even you.

11:30.428 --> 11:32.220
He had to kill for it.

11:32.303 --> 11:34.804
'S what makes it
worth something.

11:34.887 --> 11:38.136
As you will likely
find out one day...

11:38.220 --> 11:39.762
So help me God.

11:39.845 --> 11:41.512
So help me God.

11:41.595 --> 11:43.512
Congratulations.
Thank you, Your Honor.

11:53.929 --> 11:55.887
Thank you so much, Your Honor.
Thank you.

11:58.428 --> 11:59.845
You finally made it.

11:59.929 --> 12:01.970
Yeah.
Long time coming.

12:02.053 --> 12:03.470
First order of business?

12:03.553 --> 12:06.261
Something I've been giving
a lot of thought to.

12:06.345 --> 12:09.261
I want to go after...
Mr. U.S. Attorney,

12:09.345 --> 12:14.011
I would love to borrow you
for a New York minute.

12:14.095 --> 12:15.970
Mr. Attorney General.
I just want to say thank...

12:16.053 --> 12:18.178
Yeah, faith bestowed.
New beginnings.

12:18.261 --> 12:21.011
Debts of gratitude.
Fresh opportunities.

12:21.095 --> 12:22.512
All those wonderful things.

12:22.595 --> 12:25.470
Let's just consider
that covered, shall we?

12:25.553 --> 12:27.762
Okay.
Move on to sloppy inheritances.

12:27.845 --> 12:29.970
Cleaning up messes
that came before.

12:30.053 --> 12:31.178
We're talking about Chuck?

12:31.261 --> 12:33.053
We are.

12:33.136 --> 12:36.011
We get one chance to firewall
ourself off from his tenure,

12:36.095 --> 12:38.345
and this is how
we're gonna do it...

12:44.095 --> 12:47.261
You can't get Brogan
a gun permit?

12:47.345 --> 12:49.261
Pathetic.

12:49.345 --> 12:51.053
Uh, we live in New York City,
Dad, not Beaumont, Texas.

12:51.136 --> 12:52.720
Gun permits are quite hard
to come by.

12:52.804 --> 12:55.470
I sent that man in to you
because he is important

12:55.553 --> 12:57.220
in the very city
in which we live.

12:57.303 --> 12:58.512
And state.

12:58.595 --> 13:01.303
With all the benefactors
you will need.

13:01.387 --> 13:04.303
You sent him to me? Hmm?
Who the fuck else?

13:04.387 --> 13:06.053
You need to go on the offensive.

13:06.136 --> 13:10.345
Because everyone else
is lining up against you.

13:10.428 --> 13:12.595
Tell him, Ira.

13:12.679 --> 13:15.136
Hello, buddy.
Your father is correct.

13:15.220 --> 13:17.845
Most of your major cases are
being put under review by SDNY,

13:17.929 --> 13:20.595
by Connerty,
for any kind of wrongdoing.

13:20.679 --> 13:23.470
Oh, those fuckers.

13:25.428 --> 13:27.345
All my good work undone.
Hmm?

13:27.428 --> 13:29.345
Legacy trashed.

13:29.428 --> 13:32.345
All my accomplishments wiped out
as though I were never there.

13:32.428 --> 13:34.345
Yeah, that'll happen.
But it's worse than that.

13:34.428 --> 13:35.512
They're digging for misconduct,

13:35.595 --> 13:36.887
wrongful prosecutions,

13:36.970 --> 13:38.845
politically motivated
decision-making,

13:38.929 --> 13:40.095
conflict of interest...

13:40.178 --> 13:41.804
They'll try to
abandon convictions.

13:41.887 --> 13:43.553
- Your name will be ruined.
- His name?!

13:43.637 --> 13:45.261
That's my name he's wearing.

13:45.345 --> 13:47.220
And it will not be besmirched.

13:47.303 --> 13:51.053
I don't think we can stop...
Oyez, oyez, Sonny!

13:51.136 --> 13:53.553
They are trying to hang you
from the yardarm.

13:53.637 --> 13:55.762
And you have not claimed
the high ground

13:55.845 --> 13:57.345
from where
you can repel the siege.

13:57.428 --> 13:59.595
If you were in
a position of influence,

13:59.679 --> 14:01.387
- if you had a power base...
- Yes.

14:01.470 --> 14:05.136
Then you could take vengeance
on them, on Connerty and...

14:05.220 --> 14:06.762
Jeffcoat and the rest,

14:06.845 --> 14:09.011
make them defend
instead of attack.

14:09.095 --> 14:13.929
All I want is vengeance,
and it will be had.

14:14.011 --> 14:15.136
And we all know
what I need to do it.

14:15.220 --> 14:17.220
A perch.

14:17.303 --> 14:19.595
And Epstein's vacated
New York Attorney General's seat

14:19.679 --> 14:20.929
is there for me.

14:21.011 --> 14:22.220
And maybe I could win it.

14:22.303 --> 14:23.595
But the moment
I poke my head up,

14:23.679 --> 14:25.178
Jack Foley will come after me.

14:25.261 --> 14:27.303
Release what he has on me.

14:27.387 --> 14:28.970
Or threaten to,

14:29.053 --> 14:32.053
as I'm no longer
in a position to prosecute him.

14:32.136 --> 14:34.887
I would slap your face
and tell you to act like a man

14:34.970 --> 14:37.804
if I didn't think
it'd turn you on.

14:37.887 --> 14:39.804
It wouldn't, Dad.

14:39.887 --> 14:41.804
Not from you.
Not how it works.

14:41.887 --> 14:43.679
Good lord.

14:43.762 --> 14:45.428
Well, regardless.

14:45.512 --> 14:48.011
We could give what you have
to a sympathetic prosecutor.

14:48.095 --> 14:51.011
Or at the right time,
I will take care of Foley.

14:51.095 --> 14:55.095
But you get yourself
in goddamn position.

14:55.178 --> 14:58.053
Get off your ass
and rebuild your influence.

14:58.136 --> 14:59.762
Because you're gonna need it.

14:59.845 --> 15:02.387
Start by getting
that goddamn gun permit.

15:02.470 --> 15:06.929
I don't think I can, Dad.
You can and you will.

15:07.011 --> 15:10.679
The very difficulty of it

15:10.762 --> 15:12.804
is why you must.

15:15.637 --> 15:18.053
Make the rounds, Sonny.

15:18.136 --> 15:21.053
Like Billy Phelan did
in his city.

15:21.136 --> 15:23.595
You know exactly where all
the people are who can help you.

15:23.679 --> 15:25.637
Use them

15:25.720 --> 15:30.011
the way a bathhouse
piano player used poppers

15:30.095 --> 15:33.887
to give you
that electric shock of power

15:33.970 --> 15:36.845
just when you need it most.

15:36.929 --> 15:40.220
Charles,
thinking about your past,

15:40.303 --> 15:42.720
really freaks me out.

15:42.804 --> 15:46.136
What a glorious thing it was.

15:55.136 --> 15:56.970
What I remember.

15:57.053 --> 15:58.679
What made me want to sit
with you is:

15:58.762 --> 15:59.887
You weren't afraid to lead
with your heart.

15:59.970 --> 16:02.220
While absolutely smashing
your book.

16:02.303 --> 16:04.136
I'm here because of
what I remember:

16:04.220 --> 16:07.804
That you were the smartest
person I ever worked with.

16:07.887 --> 16:10.804
But then I almost
didn't come in today.

16:10.887 --> 16:13.970
Look, I get we're in a game
that requires us to win

16:14.053 --> 16:15.845
and that means
we have to shut our minds

16:15.929 --> 16:17.887
to the fact that
other professionals will lose...

16:17.970 --> 16:19.470
And you're fine with that
as long as the loser

16:19.553 --> 16:22.261
is on par with you,
but when, say it's a...

16:22.345 --> 16:25.011
Yeah. I got tired of beating up
on the defenseless.

16:25.095 --> 16:26.470
Like we taught 'em at Annapolis:

16:26.553 --> 16:28.053
It's better
than being the defenseless.

16:28.136 --> 16:30.470
That's true.
And I love that, actually.

16:30.553 --> 16:33.011
But there are things they were
comfortable with at Axe Cap

16:33.095 --> 16:34.512
that we will never do here.

16:34.595 --> 16:36.470
I made sure of that
before I signed on.

16:36.553 --> 16:39.512
It's a big part of why
I asked Sara to become COO.

16:39.595 --> 16:42.512
Her reputation, first as
Chief of Staff for the Supe,

16:42.595 --> 16:45.762
then in Silicon Valley...
Taylor, you led the charge

16:45.845 --> 16:48.261
on how to wring cash
from Sandicot.

16:48.345 --> 16:51.136
Yes. That's true.

16:51.220 --> 16:53.762
Because that's what Axe Cap
does to a person.

16:53.845 --> 16:55.303
Don't I know it.

16:55.387 --> 16:57.512
Axe and Wags, even Wendy,

16:57.595 --> 16:59.303
are like
the United Citizen Federation.

16:59.387 --> 17:01.470
They turned us all
into Starship Troopers,

17:01.553 --> 17:04.387
sent us to Klendathu and
some of us got our brains eaten.

17:04.470 --> 17:06.929
And it wasn't until the end
of our time in that we realized:

17:07.011 --> 17:08.887
We were the bad guys all along.

17:12.637 --> 17:14.720
It's not like that here.

17:14.804 --> 17:17.178
We will do it the right way
this time, man.

17:17.261 --> 17:19.303
You know how loyal I was to Axe.

17:19.387 --> 17:21.095
This is why I left him
to come here.

17:21.178 --> 17:23.553
And why you should be here, too.

17:23.637 --> 17:25.136
If I signed on,

17:25.220 --> 17:27.220
when would you be
looking for me to start?

17:27.303 --> 17:30.095
We need folks right fucking now.
We're desperate.

17:32.762 --> 17:35.762
Next week or two.

17:43.970 --> 17:46.053
Mafee.
I know.

17:46.136 --> 17:47.804
Never let anyone
outside of the family

17:47.887 --> 17:48.929
know what you're thinking.

17:49.011 --> 17:50.804
It's not enough to quote it.

17:50.887 --> 17:53.553
You need to live it.

17:53.637 --> 17:56.762
Why didn't Danzig commit
in the room?

17:56.845 --> 18:00.970
Maybe going forward,
be a little less scary?

18:01.053 --> 18:02.470
I thought I was inviting.

18:02.553 --> 18:03.762
I'm scary?

18:03.845 --> 18:04.804
Yes.
Yes.

18:04.887 --> 18:07.345
Fucking wimps.

18:07.428 --> 18:09.845
Why is Mick Danzig the best
candidate that we've seen?

18:09.929 --> 18:11.387
Where are
the applied math wizards,

18:11.470 --> 18:12.804
the financial engineers?

18:12.887 --> 18:14.428
Do I have to go
to an MIT job fair?

18:14.512 --> 18:16.011
I'm trying.

18:16.095 --> 18:17.720
Wall Street's had some
of the luster knocked off...

18:17.804 --> 18:19.970
So buff it back up
and close Danzig.

18:20.053 --> 18:22.345
Then find me people
with no fear.

18:22.428 --> 18:24.387
Like Sara.

18:29.637 --> 18:31.804
It's time for you to suit up
for the meeting.

18:34.303 --> 18:36.136
I'll step out,
let you put it on.

18:36.220 --> 18:37.970
I find that I don't want to.

18:39.929 --> 18:41.595
It's wrong that I have to.

18:41.679 --> 18:42.929
Yeah.

18:43.011 --> 18:45.220
It is.

18:45.303 --> 18:47.845
When you poached me, you said:
Whatever it takes.

18:47.929 --> 18:50.595
You said it was my job
to remind you of that,

18:50.679 --> 18:54.220
so strap it the fuck on.

19:07.011 --> 19:09.053
About personnel.

19:09.136 --> 19:11.887
We've succeeded in keeping
the best applicants away.

19:15.762 --> 19:17.595
I took care of the head hunter.

19:20.553 --> 19:22.637
It's frustrating Taylor.

19:22.720 --> 19:25.220
But they did
bring in Mick Danzig.

19:25.303 --> 19:27.637
Want to hire him.
Well, scoop him up.

19:27.720 --> 19:28.887
Overpay him.

19:28.970 --> 19:30.720
You want Danzig that much?

19:30.804 --> 19:35.220
What I want that much
is for Taylor to have nothing.

19:35.303 --> 19:37.011
With that fucking Russki
backing them,

19:37.095 --> 19:39.303
my options are limited.

19:39.387 --> 19:42.512
So these guys are gonna be
a permanent fixture?

19:42.595 --> 19:44.720
Till I find a way to get Grigor
out of here.

19:49.470 --> 19:52.679
Mr. Wagner, no one enjoys
your company more than I do...

19:52.762 --> 19:55.011
Oh. I can supply you with
the names of a couple gals

19:55.095 --> 19:56.470
who might give you a run
for your money on that.

19:56.553 --> 19:58.053
But I appreciate the sentiment...

19:58.136 --> 19:59.553
However, the Sheik would prefer,

19:59.637 --> 20:00.845
and frankly is in the habit,

20:00.929 --> 20:02.470
of sitting
with the decision maker.

20:02.553 --> 20:03.887
With Mr. Axelrod.

20:03.970 --> 20:05.261
Think of me
as that decision maker.

20:05.345 --> 20:06.887
I speak for him.

20:06.970 --> 20:07.970
Regardless, the Sheik
will not see the value

20:08.053 --> 20:09.845
in paying above market.

20:09.929 --> 20:11.720
- 2 and 20 is standard.
- Was standard.

20:11.804 --> 20:13.679
Not for an investment
the size of ours.

20:13.762 --> 20:16.178
It doesn't matter
if it's as swole as Dirk Diggler

20:16.261 --> 20:17.595
on his first night
with Rollergirl.

20:17.679 --> 20:19.679
This is one of those rare cases

20:19.762 --> 20:21.679
where size
doesn't actually matter.

20:21.762 --> 20:23.512
You know how
the price of admission

20:23.595 --> 20:25.011
for women into your fine country

20:25.095 --> 20:26.887
is that they cover
their tatas and donut?

20:26.970 --> 20:29.095
Well, our version of that
is 2 and 20.

20:29.178 --> 20:31.261
We won't stone you
if you refuse,

20:31.345 --> 20:33.679
but we will kick you
out of our fund.

20:33.762 --> 20:35.762
Are you comparing
your fee structure,

20:35.845 --> 20:38.762
by way of several vulgarisms,

20:38.845 --> 20:40.595
to our religion?

20:40.679 --> 20:43.303
To Bobby Axelrod, fees are
religion and money is his God.

20:43.387 --> 20:45.762
This makes him
the perfect shepherd for you

20:45.845 --> 20:47.178
in the material world.

20:47.261 --> 20:49.136
And at least when you pray
to his God,

20:49.220 --> 20:50.804
you get another
fucking Bentley out of it.

20:50.887 --> 20:53.136
Look, we both know
in seven to 20 years

20:53.220 --> 20:54.762
when everything runs electric

20:54.845 --> 20:56.512
you'll all be back
to herding goats over there,

20:56.595 --> 20:59.136
so you might want to get me
in front of your boss...

20:59.220 --> 21:00.512
Sadly, that will never happen

21:00.595 --> 21:02.720
if 2 and 20
is your sticking point.

21:02.804 --> 21:04.762
- Now, if you're willing to c...
- Don't even fucking think

21:04.845 --> 21:06.387
of dictating the fees, Farhad.

21:06.470 --> 21:08.261
This is getting heated,

21:08.345 --> 21:11.428
which, between friends,
is not right.

21:11.512 --> 21:15.136
Now, let's all cool off,
pick this up tomorrow.

21:15.220 --> 21:16.970
In the meanwhile,
I am hopeful that

21:17.053 --> 21:19.053
in the spirit of friendship,

21:19.136 --> 21:20.970
our nighttime plans remain on.

21:21.053 --> 21:23.970
On like Chaka Khan...

21:24.053 --> 21:26.553
<i>♪ Chaka Khan.
Chaka Khan. ♪</i>

21:26.637 --> 21:28.637
<i>♪ Chaka Khan, let me rock ya,
let me rock ya, Chaka Khan. ♪</i>

21:28.720 --> 21:30.470
<i>♪ Let me rock ya,
that's all I wanna do. ♪</i>

21:51.261 --> 21:53.845
Taylor fucking Mason...

21:53.929 --> 21:55.804
I'm telling you.

21:55.887 --> 21:57.220
But gorgeous.

21:57.303 --> 21:59.762
Like Kate Jackson hot.

21:59.845 --> 22:02.095
You sure?
Pretty fucking sure.

22:02.178 --> 22:04.011
I looked right into her...
their eyes.

22:04.095 --> 22:05.303
It'd be something of a necessity

22:05.387 --> 22:07.303
dealing with a sovereign
wealth fund.

22:07.387 --> 22:09.845
Taylor Mason,
willing to compromise

22:09.929 --> 22:13.095
their steely fucking principles
to get the loot.

22:13.178 --> 22:16.261
Well, I admire it.
But I'm gonna stop it.

22:16.345 --> 22:17.970
This could only be
the introductory meeting.

22:18.053 --> 22:19.512
No fucking way they got to
the Sheik in the first round.

22:19.595 --> 22:20.887
We can never let Taylor
get to the Sheik.

22:20.970 --> 22:23.178
Easy, big fella.

22:23.261 --> 22:27.053
They're in my head all the time.

22:27.136 --> 22:28.887
First I miss the coup.

22:28.970 --> 22:31.387
Then the leader of the coup
thinks they're sneaking in here

22:31.470 --> 22:34.011
and taking the sovereign funds
meant for me.

22:34.095 --> 22:35.845
How you doing
with the sovereign?

22:35.929 --> 22:37.595
Maybe we should scoop up
everything

22:37.679 --> 22:40.970
they're looking to invest,
shut out Mason Capital.

22:41.053 --> 22:42.261
Yeah.

22:42.345 --> 22:43.845
That's your final term.

22:43.929 --> 22:45.845
No Taylor.

22:45.929 --> 22:47.178
I haven't closed yet.

22:48.470 --> 22:49.887
They didn't react well
to the idea of us

22:49.970 --> 22:51.261
keeping to our fee level.

22:51.345 --> 22:52.804
But we're
going clubbing tonight,

22:52.887 --> 22:54.887
which you know is my métier.

22:54.970 --> 22:57.512
So we'll see what I can do.
I'm heading out.

22:57.595 --> 23:00.512
I'm gonna trade out
this funeral attire for...

23:00.595 --> 23:03.220
The all black uniform
of the middle-aged warrior?

23:03.303 --> 23:05.220
Exactly.
I'll stand by.

23:05.303 --> 23:06.428
Call me when
you need reinforcements.

23:06.512 --> 23:08.387
Call me when it's over.

23:08.470 --> 23:10.470
Just fucking call me.

23:10.553 --> 23:13.136
Copy, fratello mio.

23:25.387 --> 23:27.845
You ever just not want
a day to start?

23:27.929 --> 23:30.553
No.

23:30.637 --> 23:33.136
And neither do you.

23:33.220 --> 23:35.970
Maybe I'm going
about this wrong.

23:36.053 --> 23:38.220
Oliver Dake is teaching law...

23:38.303 --> 23:41.178
You are not Oliver fucking Dake.
And you don't want to be.

23:41.261 --> 23:44.303
If word gets out that you can't
get a VIP a gun permit,

23:44.387 --> 23:45.720
no matter how hard it is to do,

23:45.804 --> 23:47.136
the story will be
'Chuck Rhoades is over.'

23:47.220 --> 23:48.679
Then, sure, go teach.

23:48.762 --> 23:51.303
Right in the breadbasket.

23:51.387 --> 23:53.387
You know how to do this.

23:53.470 --> 23:55.220
Like a honeybee,

23:55.303 --> 23:58.261
take what you pick up here,

23:58.345 --> 24:01.720
you drop it there,

24:01.804 --> 24:03.929
just make sure
at the end of the day,

24:04.011 --> 24:06.970
you're the one who ends up
with all the nectar.

24:07.053 --> 24:10.970
Check in with me later.
I'm ready to help.

24:22.053 --> 24:24.178

24:31.011 --> 24:33.845
He's got a 12-6 curveball, boom,
drops right off the table.

24:33.929 --> 24:35.679
They're gonna protest, Chief.

24:35.762 --> 24:37.303
Gotta go with him,
he's our best chance to win.

24:37.387 --> 24:38.804
He's too old.

24:38.887 --> 24:41.220
They're not gonna let our kid
on the mound...

24:41.303 --> 24:43.053
Commissioner Sansome,

24:43.136 --> 24:45.136
imagine seeing you here
this fine morning.

24:45.220 --> 24:46.637
Former
U.S. Attorney Rhoades.

24:48.261 --> 24:50.595
Everyone knows this is
my breakfast spot.

24:50.679 --> 24:53.011
If they missed the profile
in New York Magazine,

24:53.095 --> 24:54.762
they couldn't miss
my detail out front.

24:54.845 --> 24:56.887
Sure.

24:56.970 --> 24:59.970
Listen, uh, when you're done,
I wonder if I could trouble you

25:00.053 --> 25:02.261
on the small matter
of a carry permit

25:02.345 --> 25:04.220
for a client of mine.
Chuck...

25:04.303 --> 25:07.220
you weren't a real lawman
back when you were a lawman.

25:07.303 --> 25:10.011
I'm gonna fucking
do for you now?

25:10.095 --> 25:12.387
Well,
perhaps I could do for you.

25:12.470 --> 25:13.845
There must be something that I...

25:13.970 --> 25:16.595
What you're asking for
is a key to the city,

25:16.679 --> 25:19.303
and I'm not gonna
hand it to you.

25:19.387 --> 25:21.178
Now, will you excuse us?

25:32.929 --> 25:36.303
You want a table,
Mr. Rhoades?

25:36.387 --> 25:40.011
Save your fine sable for someone
whose fortunes warrant it.

25:46.929 --> 25:49.428
Wendy, I know what
Commissioner Sansome needs.

25:49.512 --> 25:51.261
Won't be easy to get.

25:51.345 --> 25:55.011
Gonna have to pay Peter
to pay Paul to pay George,

25:55.095 --> 25:57.053
Ringo and probably John, too.

25:57.136 --> 25:58.804
But at least I have a road map.

25:58.887 --> 25:59.970
First stop?

26:00.053 --> 26:01.595
E.A.T.

26:01.679 --> 26:04.053
To see Eisen.
Of course.

26:04.136 --> 26:05.220
Not like him.

26:05.303 --> 26:06.887
No.

26:06.970 --> 26:08.970
The night work never keeps him
from the morning work...

26:09.053 --> 26:12.095
I'm gonna call him.
Again.

26:14.428 --> 26:16.595
Wags, this is the seventh time
I've tried you.

26:16.679 --> 26:18.053
Where the fuck are you at?

26:18.136 --> 26:20.053
Will you wake the fuck up
and call me?

26:22.887 --> 26:24.887
Really not like him.
Let's go wake his ass up.

26:36.804 --> 26:38.553

26:48.970 --> 26:51.387
Mr. Eisen, sir.

26:51.470 --> 26:54.095
I might have a coffee with you,
if invited.

26:56.345 --> 26:57.804
Thank you.

27:00.762 --> 27:04.095
What in this world do you need?

27:04.178 --> 27:05.804
Balls the size of Jupiter

27:05.887 --> 27:08.136
and a tight wet slot
to jam 'em into.

27:08.220 --> 27:09.845
The usual.

27:09.929 --> 27:12.095
But, uh, out of my purview.

27:12.178 --> 27:14.428
No, really:
What do you need?

27:14.512 --> 27:15.929
What the fuck is this?

27:16.011 --> 27:17.095
Who sits down
with that bullshit?

27:17.178 --> 27:18.428
Fuck you.

27:18.512 --> 27:20.345
Sure.

27:20.428 --> 27:22.762
It's the old joke
about the congressman, right?

27:22.845 --> 27:25.011
Young girl from his district
comes up to him.

27:25.095 --> 27:26.387
Says she wants to drop
to her knees,

27:26.470 --> 27:27.929
take care of his business,

27:28.011 --> 27:30.428
and bring him
a fresh made martini after.

27:30.512 --> 27:31.929
Politician looks at her
and says:

27:32.011 --> 27:34.345
Hmm, what's in it for me?

27:36.512 --> 27:38.178
No, really.
Fuck you.

27:38.261 --> 27:39.929
When you were
U.S. Attorney,

27:40.011 --> 27:41.303
there were plenty of favors
I could have used.

27:41.387 --> 27:42.970
Where were you then?

27:43.053 --> 27:45.178
That's what this morning brings:
Me changing that.

27:45.261 --> 27:46.387
Look, I could beat
about the bush.

27:46.470 --> 27:47.720
But who's that serving?

27:47.804 --> 27:49.512
I may not still be
U.S. Attorney...

27:49.595 --> 27:51.470
still plenty wired in this town.

27:51.553 --> 27:53.595
Try me out.

27:53.679 --> 27:56.011
Let me flip it first, so I know
what I'm setting myself up for.

27:56.095 --> 27:57.720
What do you fucking need?

27:57.804 --> 28:00.553
An introduction
to Ambassador Suarez.

28:00.637 --> 28:02.136
I hear you're close to him.

28:02.220 --> 28:04.178
Yeah.

28:04.261 --> 28:05.887
Uh, look.

28:05.970 --> 28:07.637
I'm not a transactional man
by nature...

28:07.720 --> 28:09.178
No. Sure.
Of course. Absolutely.

28:09.261 --> 28:10.762
But this isn't...

28:10.845 --> 28:12.970
I could intro you,
but not right now.

28:13.053 --> 28:14.595
Mm.

28:14.679 --> 28:16.136
With all the shit going on
with his stepson,

28:16.220 --> 28:18.387
the Ambassador isn't interested
in meeting people

28:18.470 --> 28:19.804
who are looking for favors.

28:19.887 --> 28:21.970
If I put you with him,

28:22.053 --> 28:25.804
then, yeah, I'd have to
get something in return.

28:25.887 --> 28:29.512
Okay, then let me suggest
a favor I can do for you,

28:29.595 --> 28:31.512
since you won't volunteer one.

28:31.595 --> 28:34.637
I have a Park-Anywhere Permit.

28:34.720 --> 28:36.512
Say the word, and it's yours.

28:36.595 --> 28:37.845
I've got a Mayor's Office Pass.

28:37.929 --> 28:39.512
Had one since
Bloomberg's first term.

28:39.595 --> 28:40.929
Thanks anyway.

28:41.011 --> 28:42.553
Well, there must be something

28:42.637 --> 28:44.428
that would make it worthwhile.

28:44.512 --> 28:46.512
Ahhh, there's one thing,

28:46.595 --> 28:48.679
but really not
in your, uh, "purview."

28:48.762 --> 28:50.470
Try me.

28:50.553 --> 28:52.095
I need tickets

28:52.178 --> 28:54.261
to the Central Synagogue
children's Hanukkah service.

28:54.345 --> 28:55.970
Done.
How many?

28:56.053 --> 28:57.762
In the main room.
Not in the overflow.

28:57.845 --> 28:59.595
I want to sit with my daughter,

28:59.679 --> 29:00.804
but my ex's brother is
the president of the board.

29:00.887 --> 29:02.512
He's keeping me out.

29:02.595 --> 29:05.261
You get that done for me,

29:05.345 --> 29:07.011
and I'll put you
with the Ambassador.

29:07.095 --> 29:09.220

Yes.

29:49.637 --> 29:52.303

of the proverbial lifetime pass
to the Polo Grounds.

29:55.303 --> 29:57.929
And I'm prepared to give you
Cleopatra on a plate for it.

29:58.011 --> 29:59.512
I need your ducats

29:59.595 --> 30:02.053

30:02.136 --> 30:03.762

out of town, yeah?

30:05.887 --> 30:08.053
I'm gonna be skiing,
but do you have any idea

30:08.136 --> 30:09.887
what I can get
for those tickets, man?

30:09.970 --> 30:13.220
How about for
a Park-Anywhere Permit?

30:13.303 --> 30:14.970
Got one right here
and it's yours.

30:15.053 --> 30:19.595
Already got one
for each of my cars.

30:19.679 --> 30:24.136
Well, uh, there must be
something you need.

30:24.220 --> 30:26.053
First tracks, Deer Valley.

30:26.136 --> 30:27.804
Now, that's private access
to the mountain,

30:27.887 --> 30:29.512
half hour before it opens...
Mm-hmm.

30:29.595 --> 30:31.804
...ultimate, ultimate privilege.
Mm.

30:31.887 --> 30:33.387
There's only five,
and they're all gone.

30:33.470 --> 30:34.720
How many days do you need?

30:34.804 --> 30:38.512
Days?
Entire season.

30:38.595 --> 30:40.720
I get you that...

30:40.804 --> 30:43.512
You got your tickets.

30:43.595 --> 30:45.887
Lemme work...

30:54.720 --> 30:56.762
So now, you show up in person.

30:56.845 --> 30:58.970
Good to see you,
Mr. Axelrod.

30:59.053 --> 31:01.804
Farhad.

31:01.887 --> 31:05.637
Where's my man, where's Wags?

31:05.720 --> 31:07.428
You don't know?

31:07.512 --> 31:09.261
I wouldn't be standing here
if I did.

31:11.595 --> 31:13.261
What happened last night?

31:19.303 --> 31:21.804
The party continued back here
to the lounge on the roof.

31:21.887 --> 31:23.929
Unfortunately,
the Sheik was occupied

31:24.011 --> 31:25.512
and they didn't get to speak.

31:25.595 --> 31:27.428
I retired after 3:00.

31:27.512 --> 31:29.720
I'm not sure
when Mr. Wagner left.

31:29.804 --> 31:32.178
Perhaps he overindulged?

31:32.261 --> 31:34.387
I want to see for myself.

31:34.470 --> 31:36.345
All right.

31:51.011 --> 31:52.887
He says the party ended
around 4:30

31:52.970 --> 31:54.553
and the remaining guests left.

31:54.637 --> 31:56.261
Left this area or the building?

32:03.470 --> 32:05.136
He's not sure.

32:05.220 --> 32:06.637
He stayed here and they left.

32:06.720 --> 32:07.929
The women.
And Mr. Wagner.

32:08.011 --> 32:09.637
He assumed they exited.

32:09.720 --> 32:11.470
Are there any
overnight quarters here?

32:11.553 --> 32:14.804
No.
What makes you think he's here?

32:14.887 --> 32:17.220
His cell pinged here
as his last location.

32:20.387 --> 32:22.470
This is Mr. Wagner's.
He dropped it.

32:22.553 --> 32:24.470
He'll want it back
when you find him.

32:24.553 --> 32:26.053
We want to search the building.

32:26.136 --> 32:28.428
I'm afraid not,
Mr. Axelrod.

32:28.512 --> 32:30.053
You are on our soil.

32:30.136 --> 32:31.428
All decisions of that nature
will be handled

32:31.512 --> 32:34.261
by the Sheik, through me.

32:34.345 --> 32:36.261
Now, since you're here,

32:36.345 --> 32:37.929
the Sheik would like me
to go through the terms...

32:38.011 --> 32:40.220
First I find Wags, then I sit
with the guy in the robes.

32:40.303 --> 32:43.011
As your Mr. Wagner said to me:
I speak for that man.

32:43.095 --> 32:44.929
Uh-huh.

32:45.011 --> 32:48.428
Look, put me with the Sheik
so we can sort all this out.

32:48.512 --> 32:50.720
Of course.

32:50.804 --> 32:53.011
But you will have to wait,
as everything runs

32:53.095 --> 32:54.887
on the Sheik's
very busy schedule.

32:59.553 --> 33:01.553
Is he fucking in there?

33:01.637 --> 33:03.011
It's possible.

33:03.095 --> 33:05.095
We call the cops, the FBI?

33:05.178 --> 33:07.136
They get turned away.
Diplomatic immunity.

33:07.220 --> 33:10.637
And it gets very public.
Very messy.

33:10.720 --> 33:14.220
You say goodbye to managing
sovereign wealth ever again.

33:14.303 --> 33:18.011
Let me pull security cam footage
from nearby buildings,

33:18.095 --> 33:19.303
see if he actually left.

33:19.387 --> 33:20.387
Fine.

33:20.470 --> 33:21.970
Fuck.

33:22.053 --> 33:23.720
They're doing this
for leverage...

33:23.804 --> 33:26.553
'cause they want to be able
to dictate terms on the deal.

33:26.637 --> 33:29.220
They put themselves in
a good position to do just that.

33:29.303 --> 33:32.428
Yeah. Well, we need
some leverage of our own.

33:32.512 --> 33:33.470
I'm on it.

33:40.804 --> 33:43.553
Well, you were right,
there he is.

33:43.637 --> 33:45.345
Cheetah's gotta visit
the water hole.

33:45.428 --> 33:47.762
Yeah.

33:47.845 --> 33:50.261
He's sure to scatter
if I just walk up to him.

33:50.345 --> 33:52.178
After all, I did
prosecute the man.

33:52.261 --> 33:54.136
I'll do it.

33:54.220 --> 33:56.136
You are a gentle-lady
and a scholar.

33:56.220 --> 33:58.095
Uh-huh.

33:58.178 --> 34:00.261
Oh, uh, offer him my
Park-Anywhere Permit

34:00.345 --> 34:01.553
if you need to.

34:12.553 --> 34:15.136
Steven Birch.

34:15.219 --> 34:17.969
The face that launched
a thousand shorts.

34:20.011 --> 34:21.553
What can I do for you?

34:48.929 --> 34:50.428
He said he hurt his knee

34:50.512 --> 34:52.512
and his wife prefers the beach
to skiing.

34:52.594 --> 34:54.929
Mm-hmm.

34:55.011 --> 34:56.887
You have his first tracks.

34:59.011 --> 35:00.345
What'd you trade for them?

35:00.428 --> 35:02.595
It was the parking permit,
wasn't it?

35:02.679 --> 35:04.637
No, Chuck.

35:04.720 --> 35:06.762
Really?

35:06.845 --> 35:08.261
Nobody wants this fucking thing.

35:08.345 --> 35:09.595
So, what did you trade?

35:09.679 --> 35:11.011
A session.

35:11.095 --> 35:13.261
Isn't that cheating on Axe?

35:13.345 --> 35:15.929
I won't give Birch
the 'A' stuff.

35:20.136 --> 35:24.136
I've got your first tracks,
Donny D.

35:24.220 --> 35:26.261
Nice.

35:26.345 --> 35:29.804
Then you, sir, have your
children's service tickets.

35:29.887 --> 35:31.512
Take care, Chuck.
Take care.

35:36.136 --> 35:38.011
Now, take me to the Ambassador.

35:38.095 --> 35:40.679
I will and I can.
Good. Let's go.

35:40.762 --> 35:43.512
Soon.
Fuck soon.

35:43.595 --> 35:46.387
I didn't expect you
to put this together so quickly.

35:46.470 --> 35:49.136
I'm not the actual guy
to make the actual introduction,

35:49.220 --> 35:52.762
but I can introduce you
to a guy who can.

35:52.845 --> 35:55.970
Why don't you call that guy?

35:56.053 --> 35:58.345
Right now.

36:10.470 --> 36:12.720
You see, falcons mate for life.

36:12.804 --> 36:15.053
As humans do...

36:15.136 --> 36:17.595
sometimes.

36:17.679 --> 36:19.679
They're much more consistent
than we are.

36:19.762 --> 36:21.929
Because they know who they are.

36:22.011 --> 36:24.220
The males go out and hunt
and bring back food.

36:24.303 --> 36:26.136
And the females stay
in the nest,

36:26.220 --> 36:29.220
defending it,
tending to the young.

36:29.303 --> 36:31.762
As nature dictates.

36:31.845 --> 36:34.720
Yes, that kind of bifurcation
of roles makes sense,

36:34.804 --> 36:36.845
when you're dealing with
a single meal at a time.

36:36.929 --> 36:39.679
But when the hunt
will provide for generations,

36:39.762 --> 36:42.679
one would do well to go with
whoever can get the best kill.

36:46.345 --> 36:48.428
I like the logic and strength
of this argument.

36:48.512 --> 36:50.136
Come.

36:50.220 --> 36:51.929
Let us take some tea
with the Sheik.

37:00.512 --> 37:02.428
Go.

37:02.512 --> 37:04.804
Security footage
from neighboring buildings

37:04.887 --> 37:06.136
says Wags never left.

37:06.220 --> 37:08.011
Motherfuckers.

37:08.095 --> 37:09.512
What could they be doing to him?

37:09.595 --> 37:11.053
Unclear.

37:11.136 --> 37:12.136
Have they got him chained up?

37:12.220 --> 37:13.512
Would they torture him,

37:13.595 --> 37:15.387
rendition him back
to their country?

37:15.470 --> 37:17.679
Chemicals more likely...

37:17.762 --> 37:20.970
Pentathol, perhaps,
other sedatives,

37:21.053 --> 37:25.762
to encourage docility,
but, again, unclear.

37:25.845 --> 37:28.136
Have we discovered any leverage?

37:28.220 --> 37:30.720
I have something you can play
in the room.

37:30.804 --> 37:32.720
The kind of scandal
that scares the shit

37:32.804 --> 37:35.387
out of even the most powerful
people in the Middle East.

37:40.553 --> 37:42.679
Good.

37:42.762 --> 37:44.512
This may be enough to free Wags,

37:44.595 --> 37:47.387
and to keep the sovereign money
out of Taylor's hands.

37:47.470 --> 37:50.303
If I can get
in the fucking room.

37:50.387 --> 37:52.303
If I don't hear
that I've got a meeting

37:52.387 --> 37:54.136
by day's end, fuck Axe Capital.

37:54.220 --> 37:55.428
I'm gonna call
the State Department.

37:55.512 --> 37:57.095
We blow this whole thing up.

37:59.804 --> 38:02.970
Nacho, this is Chuck.

38:03.053 --> 38:04.845
He needs to meet the Ambassador.

38:04.929 --> 38:06.804
Oh, yeah?
Well, Ambassador Suarez

38:06.887 --> 38:08.595
isn't taking
any meetings right now.

38:08.679 --> 38:11.178
Not until this bullshit
with his stepson is fixed.

38:11.261 --> 38:13.804
Man, this fucking city,
it nibbles away at you

38:13.887 --> 38:15.762
like fucking piranhas
until there's nothing left.

38:15.845 --> 38:17.470
Mm.

38:17.553 --> 38:18.804
They put a Citi Bike rack
on my fucking street,

38:18.887 --> 38:20.595
took up all the legal spots.

38:20.679 --> 38:22.136
I was just talking to my lawyer

38:22.220 --> 38:23.804
who's dealing with
three thousand dollars

38:23.887 --> 38:25.428
worth of fucking
parking tickets for me.

38:28.136 --> 38:31.804
Tell me this:
Can you make tickets go away?

38:31.887 --> 38:34.261
You put me with the Ambassador,

38:34.345 --> 38:36.595
I think I can do you one better.

38:38.512 --> 38:42.637
You'll never get
a parking ticket again.

38:42.720 --> 38:44.595
Yeah.

38:44.679 --> 38:46.178
Robert Axelrod,
Atlas of the finance world.

38:46.261 --> 38:48.261
Charles Rhoades, Esquire.

38:48.345 --> 38:50.178
There's a, uh, situation.

38:50.261 --> 38:53.095
That new charter school
that's going into Tribeca.

38:53.178 --> 38:57.220
It's become central in some
contract I just made with a guy.

38:57.303 --> 38:59.428
And you saw I was on the board
of that school.

38:59.512 --> 39:02.053
And I wondered what it
might take to move that school

39:02.136 --> 39:05.345
to a different spot,
a few blocks away.

39:05.428 --> 39:08.345
It'd take plenty...
but who cares?

39:08.428 --> 39:10.637
If it matters to you,
I can do it.

39:10.720 --> 39:12.261
Meet with my man Sean Ayles.

39:12.345 --> 39:14.261
He'll take it from there.
Thank you.

39:14.345 --> 39:16.303
You'll have fun with Ayles.

39:16.387 --> 39:18.512
He's exactly the opposite
of what he seems.

39:18.595 --> 39:20.095
Who isn't these days?

39:21.637 --> 39:24.136
I gotta go.

39:24.220 --> 39:25.762
- Yeah?
- It's Farhad.

39:25.845 --> 39:28.095
You have your meeting
with the Sheik in one hour.

39:28.178 --> 39:30.387
I'll be there.

39:33.929 --> 39:36.679
Hall, I've got the meeting...

39:38.970 --> 39:42.804
I believe our target
is sipping a mojito dead ahead.

39:42.887 --> 39:45.261
Uh-huh.

39:45.345 --> 39:47.470
I believe you are correct.

39:47.553 --> 39:50.136
<i>♪ Two sticks of dynamite,
a 38 Snub ♪</i>

39:50.220 --> 39:52.720
<i>♪ He went to see the Don
without an invitation ♪</i>

39:52.804 --> 39:54.220
Ambassador Suarez.

39:54.303 --> 39:55.887
Yes.

39:55.970 --> 39:58.970
I understand you're having
a problem with your stepson.

39:59.053 --> 40:02.345
I am having problems
with the puritanical mores

40:02.428 --> 40:04.679
and laws
in this provincial country.

40:04.762 --> 40:06.345
Mm.

40:06.428 --> 40:08.679
A fight for the soul of
our nation is indeed under way.

40:08.762 --> 40:11.095
Mm.

40:11.178 --> 40:14.095
My stepson merely got started
with his girlfriend

40:14.178 --> 40:15.387
when she was a bit too young.

40:15.470 --> 40:18.303
Mm-hmm.
She was 16, he was 20.

40:18.387 --> 40:20.136
- Ah.
- Her parents,

40:20.220 --> 40:22.470
fucking crazy people,

40:22.553 --> 40:26.303
went to the police and he had
to register as a sex offender...

40:26.387 --> 40:28.720
And with the charter school
opening on his block,

40:28.804 --> 40:30.345
he now has to move.

40:30.428 --> 40:32.387
In order to stay beyond
the buffer zone.

40:32.470 --> 40:35.053
It's making my wife miserable.

40:35.136 --> 40:37.762
I am here
to alleviate her symptoms.

40:37.845 --> 40:40.178
Yeah.
Mr. Ayles...

40:40.261 --> 40:41.970
The thing is, and a propitious
thing it is indeed...

40:42.053 --> 40:43.762
Mm.

40:43.845 --> 40:47.512
I represent a board member,
and his message to you

40:47.595 --> 40:50.178
is that that school
does not have to go there.

40:50.261 --> 40:52.136
As simple as that?

40:52.220 --> 40:54.929
Oh, nearly so, sir.

40:55.011 --> 40:56.679
Nearly so.

40:56.762 --> 41:00.261
And what do you want from me,
my newfound friends?

41:44.845 --> 41:49.720
The final authority on this
is behind that door.

41:49.804 --> 41:51.929
The Sheik is in there?

42:13.512 --> 42:16.011
Well, that's got to feel like

42:16.095 --> 42:18.220
a surprise party of one.

42:18.303 --> 42:22.303
First the shock and then
that warm feeling of seeing

42:22.387 --> 42:26.053
how far out of the way
people have gone for you.

42:26.136 --> 42:27.845
Something like that, yes.

42:27.929 --> 42:29.178
Good!

42:29.261 --> 42:31.053
It's true, I am not the Sheik.

42:31.136 --> 42:32.845
But in some ways, I am.

42:32.929 --> 42:36.762
Our powers.
Our reach, is similar.

42:36.845 --> 42:38.220
His English is better.

42:38.303 --> 42:40.512
Yeah, sure.
He went to your schools.

42:40.595 --> 42:42.261
I had to pick it up

42:42.345 --> 42:45.303
watching the Happy Days
and Mike Wallace.

42:45.387 --> 42:48.387
Though my favorite
was Rollerball.

42:48.470 --> 42:50.095
The original.

42:50.178 --> 42:53.345
You decided that you weren't
gonna be one of the players.

42:53.428 --> 42:56.261
Instead one of the men above,
controlling them.

42:56.345 --> 42:58.470
Playing looked like a gas.

42:58.553 --> 43:01.637
Until the spikes came out.

43:01.720 --> 43:04.553
I prefer to watch
the collisions.

43:04.637 --> 43:07.845
Set in motion
the factors that cause them.

43:07.929 --> 43:11.804
Your man, Wags,
could have avoided his.

43:11.887 --> 43:13.470
But he mentioned Taylor's fund.

43:13.553 --> 43:15.220
And somehow
word got back to you.

43:15.303 --> 43:17.095
Not somehow.

43:17.178 --> 43:19.845
I have a very deep relationship
with the Royal Family.

43:19.929 --> 43:22.804
I leave various oil markets
open to them,

43:22.887 --> 43:26.887
and they allow
my investments to thrive.

43:26.970 --> 43:28.887
In hedge funds such as Taylor's.

43:28.970 --> 43:32.595
We look out
for each other's interests.

43:32.679 --> 43:35.136
As I had hoped you and I would.

43:35.220 --> 43:37.011
I hoped for that as well.

43:37.095 --> 43:38.804
But you didn't act like it.

43:38.887 --> 43:41.679
Instead, you tried
to stop Taylor

43:41.762 --> 43:44.345
from getting
the additional capital

43:44.428 --> 43:48.136
to allow their firm to grow,
make bigger plays.

43:48.220 --> 43:49.595
This affects me.

43:49.679 --> 43:51.720
Wasn't my intention
to cause you harm.

43:51.804 --> 43:55.261
Intentions don't matter
at all to me.

43:55.345 --> 43:57.428
I reward actions.

43:57.512 --> 43:59.095
And I punish them, too.

43:59.178 --> 44:00.720
As I know you do, Axe,

44:00.804 --> 44:05.887
in your slightly smaller section
of the world.

44:05.970 --> 44:08.553
You should know that Wags
was only following orders.

44:08.637 --> 44:10.929
My orders.
Don't fret.

44:11.011 --> 44:14.178
Your man will be waiting
for you in your car.

44:14.261 --> 44:17.136
He's going to have a hell
of a headache for a few days.

44:17.220 --> 44:19.261
But it will wear off.

44:19.345 --> 44:23.637
I do this for you as a favor
for old times' sake.

44:23.720 --> 44:26.595
This is what I'm telling you.

44:26.679 --> 44:29.595
Thank you.
No sweat, Fonzie.

44:34.011 --> 44:36.136
Now:

44:36.220 --> 44:40.595
Please stop fucking
with Taylor Mason.

44:40.679 --> 44:43.679
As a matter of fact,
by the time you get back

44:43.762 --> 44:47.762
to your luxurious penthouse,
forget all about them.

44:47.845 --> 44:51.220
But be sure you don't
forget about me.

45:18.637 --> 45:20.136
Hey!

45:20.220 --> 45:21.929
Hey.

45:22.011 --> 45:23.679
You okay, man?

45:23.762 --> 45:26.512
I don't know what's
coursing through my body.

45:26.595 --> 45:30.011
GHB, ketamine.
Whoof.

45:30.095 --> 45:33.136
I mean,
everything was going great.

45:33.220 --> 45:34.887
Then they turned on me

45:34.970 --> 45:37.637
like Sharon Stone did
in Total Recall.

45:37.720 --> 45:39.679
Well, you do look
a little like Kuato.

45:39.762 --> 45:41.011
Hmm.

45:41.095 --> 45:43.011
Hey.

45:43.095 --> 45:45.470
They took you to get to me.

45:45.553 --> 45:48.595
I'm sorry you got
caught up in it.

45:48.679 --> 45:51.261
The Sheik never
has to say sorry.

46:04.136 --> 46:07.762
<i>♪ Pick me a town in any clime ♪</i>

46:07.845 --> 46:10.428

46:12.345 --> 46:14.470
Ah, working man's bar.

46:14.553 --> 46:16.512
Oh, when I saw you here

46:16.595 --> 46:19.220
I figured it was
Eagle Scout night.

46:19.303 --> 46:22.720
<i>♪ Smack dab

46:22.804 --> 46:24.553
<i>♪ Smack dab

46:24.637 --> 46:26.553
Rhoades.

46:26.637 --> 46:29.845
You keep popping up like
a turd remnant that won't flush.

46:29.929 --> 46:32.053
You've got a problem
with your ace pitcher

46:32.136 --> 46:34.261
in the Police Benevolent
Little League playoffs.

46:34.345 --> 46:38.136
<i>♪ I want ten Cadillacs

46:38.220 --> 46:40.553

46:42.303 --> 46:44.261
And, so?

46:44.345 --> 46:46.011
The cut off
is fucking arbitrary,

46:46.095 --> 46:47.887
the kid is
five-and-a-half months too old.

46:47.970 --> 46:49.178
This one's a few months
too young,

46:49.261 --> 46:50.595
that one's a few months too old.

46:50.679 --> 46:53.595
These things
can all balance out.

46:53.679 --> 46:55.470
What if told you your pitcher
can be any age

46:55.553 --> 46:56.762
you need him to be?

46:56.845 --> 46:58.804
The fuck you say?

46:58.887 --> 47:01.553
<i>♪ Well, let me rock and roll... ♪</i>

47:01.637 --> 47:05.053
That one has been destroyed.

47:05.136 --> 47:07.345
Fill this out, make a copy,

47:07.428 --> 47:09.804
and give me back the original
to be filed.

47:09.887 --> 47:11.762
Blank Dominican
birth certificate.

47:11.845 --> 47:14.303
Kid can pitch Little League
for the next five years

47:14.387 --> 47:16.637
if you want.

47:16.720 --> 47:18.095
How?

47:18.178 --> 47:19.720
I want to know
about splash back.

47:19.804 --> 47:21.095
None at all.

47:21.178 --> 47:22.470
Full sneeze shield protection.

47:22.553 --> 47:23.845
High-level diplomat.

47:23.929 --> 47:25.887
Never heard your name
or a 'why.'

47:25.970 --> 47:28.095
Only knew he owed me a favor.

47:28.178 --> 47:30.303
Yeah.

47:30.387 --> 47:33.887
As I do now.

47:39.011 --> 47:42.136
You got that carry permit
you were looking for.

47:42.220 --> 47:44.929
Thank you.

47:45.011 --> 47:48.553
Let this be a beginning
and not an ending.

48:01.470 --> 48:03.136
I got your text.

48:03.220 --> 48:04.929
Yeah.

48:05.011 --> 48:06.512
Long meeting.
Eight hours.

48:06.595 --> 48:09.387
But the money
is coming on board.

48:09.470 --> 48:12.387
It was brave that you did
what you had to do to get it.

48:12.470 --> 48:14.303
Whatever it takes.

48:14.387 --> 48:16.261
Still not used to
having enemies.

48:16.345 --> 48:19.011
It's a sign of your stature.

48:19.095 --> 48:21.387
Get used to it.

48:21.470 --> 48:23.512
Axe hired Danzig.

48:23.595 --> 48:24.929
The head hunter's
been compromised.

48:25.011 --> 48:26.595
- Fire her.
- Already done.

48:26.679 --> 48:28.512
What other measures can we take?

48:28.595 --> 48:31.011
We need to hire
a Counter Intel specialist.

48:31.095 --> 48:33.261
Do it...

48:33.345 --> 48:34.595
I'm sorry to wake you.

48:34.679 --> 48:36.929
It's okay,
what else was I doing?

48:40.637 --> 48:42.720
Do you have it yet?

48:44.553 --> 48:48.178
I could just walk away,
just run Axe Cap,

48:48.261 --> 48:50.929
forget all about Taylor,
just like Grigor told me.

48:51.011 --> 48:53.053
Might even be
the 'mature' thing.

48:53.136 --> 48:54.553
Fuck mature.

48:54.637 --> 48:56.470
I'm overmatched.

48:56.553 --> 48:59.762
For the first time
since I can remember.

48:59.845 --> 49:01.095
He's richer than me.

49:01.178 --> 49:04.804
And he's willing to do shit
I am not.

49:04.887 --> 49:06.470
And he's connected
to all those other people

49:06.553 --> 49:08.428
wanting to do
the same shit for him.

49:08.512 --> 49:10.303
You walking away?

49:13.595 --> 49:16.178
You're not walking away.

49:16.261 --> 49:19.387
Because, yeah,
he's a Russian Oligarch.

49:19.470 --> 49:21.970
But you, mon frère, are a
motherfucking Oligarch, too.

49:22.053 --> 49:23.929
An American Oligarch.

49:24.011 --> 49:25.970
You will not relent.

49:26.053 --> 49:27.804
Taylor must pay.

49:27.887 --> 49:30.679
Well, we have to do it without
Grigor getting a whiff of us.

49:30.762 --> 49:34.136
Any losses Taylor Mason Capital
has will seem suspect.

49:34.220 --> 49:37.136
The guy's as mercurial
as Sinatra with a cold.

49:37.220 --> 49:39.053
Sooner than later, he's gonna
pull his money from Taylor,

49:39.136 --> 49:40.428
you know.

49:40.512 --> 49:41.804
Then he won't care.

49:41.887 --> 49:44.470
Just wait it out.

49:44.553 --> 49:46.220
You said it, Wags.

49:46.303 --> 49:48.637
We make him mercurial.

49:48.720 --> 49:50.804
Entice him to take
his money elsewhere.

49:50.887 --> 49:52.762
Not 'cause he's getting
beaten up,

49:52.845 --> 49:54.345
but because nothing's happening.

49:54.428 --> 49:57.470
He's not losing money, but he's
not making money either.

49:57.553 --> 50:00.553
We don't put out this fire
by pouring water on it.

50:00.637 --> 50:03.637
But by sucking oxygen
out of the room.

50:03.720 --> 50:06.512
Slowly. Invisibly.

50:06.595 --> 50:08.720
Completely.

50:16.136 --> 50:18.261
I'm sending
my fucking doctor over.

50:18.345 --> 50:19.762
First thing tomorrow.

50:19.845 --> 50:21.929
Whatever you say, Papa...

50:28.887 --> 50:32.845
I haven't been this banged up
for quite a while.

50:32.929 --> 50:34.637
You hold it well.

50:34.720 --> 50:37.178
I don't know why I should be
surprised by that, but I am.

50:37.261 --> 50:38.845
Used to be like this
five nights a week for me

50:38.929 --> 50:40.720
back when I was a line pross.

50:40.804 --> 50:44.011
Oh, shit.
I just realized where we are.

50:44.095 --> 50:45.970
You remember that night?
Sure.

50:46.053 --> 50:48.095
The night Gotti hit Castellano.

50:48.178 --> 50:50.470
They got his driver
Tommy Bilotti too.

50:50.553 --> 50:52.303
Yeah.
Boom, boom, boom.

50:52.387 --> 50:55.929
I was a beat cop back then,
fresh out of the Academy. You?

50:56.011 --> 50:57.970
Home from school for Christmas.

51:01.136 --> 51:03.970
There was a way order used to
be maintained back then.

51:04.053 --> 51:06.303
On both sides
of the damn street.

51:06.387 --> 51:07.845
Back when New York worked.

51:07.929 --> 51:09.762
Handshakes
and gentlemen's agreements

51:09.845 --> 51:11.095
that could be counted on.

51:11.178 --> 51:13.512
That order got shot to shit
that night.

51:13.595 --> 51:15.804
Fuckin' A.

51:15.887 --> 51:18.303
Some of us are still old school,
though, right?

51:18.387 --> 51:20.679
All the way...

51:20.762 --> 51:22.804
Remember the pictures
of Castellano...?

51:22.887 --> 51:25.345
Oh.

51:25.428 --> 51:28.428
Guy thought he was heading
for a beautiful steak, right?

51:28.512 --> 51:30.845
Barely gets out the car, boom.

51:32.595 --> 51:35.387
Right? His mouth's all open.

51:35.470 --> 51:38.303
Oh, my God.

51:42.053 --> 51:44.303
Some fucking night
that was, huh?

51:46.679 --> 51:50.095
You know, I kind of
feel bad for the old guy,

51:50.178 --> 51:52.804
scumbag that he was.

51:54.929 --> 51:58.178
Blindsided like that.

51:58.261 --> 52:02.887
But I guess that's New York
for ya, right?

52:02.970 --> 52:05.345
Boss one minute,
in the gutter the next.

52:05.428 --> 52:07.261
Yeah.

52:07.345 --> 52:09.512
The best you can hope for
is one last look at the stars

52:09.595 --> 52:11.595
before you go.
