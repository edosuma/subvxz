02:35.654 --> 02:37.787
Yup, all right.

02:37.789 --> 02:39.089
Just hold on a second.

02:39.091 --> 02:40.123
Look, man, is there any
way we can speed this up?

02:40.125 --> 02:41.292
I'm really, really in a rush.

02:41.294 --> 02:43.127
Sir, I'll get right
on that for you.

02:43.129 --> 02:44.264
So, what did he say?

02:46.064 --> 02:46.964
Are you kidding me?

02:46.966 --> 02:48.134
Fuck that guy, man.

02:49.402 --> 02:50.234
Sir?

02:50.236 --> 02:51.067
I'm done talking about this.

02:51.069 --> 02:52.369
Your order's ready.

02:52.371 --> 02:53.537
Send it
to me in an email,

02:53.539 --> 02:55.906
- okay?
- Thank you, have a good day.

02:55.908 --> 02:57.007
How are ya doin', David?

02:57.009 --> 02:57.841
How have you been?

02:57.843 --> 02:59.175
Hey, Jay, I'm good.

02:59.177 --> 03:00.009
You know, I'm tryin' to
avoid assholes like that.

03:00.011 --> 03:01.110
What about you?

03:01.112 --> 03:02.479
Tryin' to avoid
assholes like that.

03:02.481 --> 03:04.014
You know how it goes.

03:04.016 --> 03:05.085
This is yours.

03:06.318 --> 03:08.752
One thing: do not tell
my wife about this, okay?

03:08.754 --> 03:09.986
Promise, our secret.

03:09.988 --> 03:11.087
Good to see you, Jay.

03:11.089 --> 03:12.021
Always good to see you, Dave.

03:12.023 --> 03:14.461
Thank you, young lady.

03:26.237 --> 03:27.738
Hey, babe.

03:27.740 --> 03:29.806
Just wanted to let you
know that we got here safe.

03:29.808 --> 03:31.341
The video call is on,

03:31.343 --> 03:34.144
so we're just waiting
for you to get home.

03:34.146 --> 03:36.045
Someone is excited
to hear from you.

03:36.047 --> 03:37.013
Love you.

03:37.015 --> 03:39.152
I love those guys.

03:54.200 --> 03:55.399
Hi, Daddy.

03:55.401 --> 03:56.633
Hello.

03:56.635 --> 03:58.769
So, how do you
like Mexico so far?

03:58.771 --> 04:00.169
I kinda miss home,

04:00.171 --> 04:02.173
but I also miss you, too, Daddy.

04:02.175 --> 04:03.372
Oh, baby, it's okay, come on.

04:03.374 --> 04:06.075
You're gonna see
Grandma and Grandpa.

04:06.077 --> 04:07.577
It's their wedding anniversary.

04:07.579 --> 04:09.246
And you know how much
you love the ocean.

04:09.248 --> 04:10.480
That's what I told her.

04:10.482 --> 04:11.715
Oh, and
when we got here,

04:11.717 --> 04:13.984
I lugged the big
bags all by myself.

04:13.986 --> 04:14.817
Really?

04:14.819 --> 04:15.587
Show me those muscles.

04:17.522 --> 04:20.055
Look at that, strong like Daddy.

04:20.058 --> 04:23.193
No, you mean
strong like Mommy.

04:23.195 --> 04:24.160
Yeah, yeah, I know.

04:24.162 --> 04:25.564
Are you eating Jay's?

04:26.998 --> 04:28.332
Mm-hmm.

04:28.334 --> 04:30.333
Mm, you know you're
not supposed to eat that.

04:30.335 --> 04:31.602
Yeah, she's right.

04:31.604 --> 04:33.169
You're not supposed to
be eating that, Daddy.

04:33.171 --> 04:34.003
Hold on.

04:34.005 --> 04:35.506
Jay's from the Bronx.

04:35.508 --> 04:37.208
And Chinese?

04:37.210 --> 04:38.741
Bronx-Chinese, it doesn't
get better than that.

04:39.945 --> 04:42.145
I don't wanna hear any
complainings when you get sick.

04:42.147 --> 04:43.580
I'm not gonna get sick.

04:43.582 --> 04:47.618
- Watch, mm.
- Mm-hmm, we'll see.

04:48.320 --> 04:49.953
So, how did it go today?

04:49.955 --> 04:51.087
You know, well,

04:51.089 --> 04:52.724
they invited me to take
the black belt two.

04:54.125 --> 04:55.827
Those are great news, babe.

04:56.996 --> 05:01.164
- So, my executive badass.
- Very funny.

05:01.166 --> 05:04.335
Is there any way you
can get here any earlier?

05:04.337 --> 05:08.037
I mean, two weeks
is a long time.

05:08.039 --> 05:12.176
Well, just by chance I did
close the Kovash deal today,

05:12.178 --> 05:13.844
so I think it might have
bought me some good will.

05:13.846 --> 05:16.347
I'm gonna be there in
four days, my baby.

05:16.349 --> 05:17.515
Okay, babe.

05:17.517 --> 05:19.215
I'll let you get
back to your daughter

05:19.217 --> 05:21.217
while I get ready for bed.

05:21.219 --> 05:22.184
How's that?

05:22.186 --> 05:23.453
Okay.

05:23.455 --> 05:25.688
- I love you so much.
- I love you, honey.

05:25.690 --> 05:27.323
So, honey, Daddy's
gonna come right back.

05:27.325 --> 05:29.660
- Just give me a second, okay?
- Where are you going?

05:29.662 --> 05:31.695
Daddy's just gonna
grab a glass of wine, sweetie.

05:31.697 --> 05:32.996
Wine?

05:32.998 --> 05:34.263
Really?

05:34.265 --> 05:36.099
You're not supposed
to be drinking wine.

05:36.101 --> 05:37.301
Is that right, little lady?

05:37.303 --> 05:38.902
Don't give him
such a hard time.

05:38.904 --> 05:39.939
I'm sure he earned it.

05:40.972 --> 05:42.106
See?

05:42.108 --> 05:44.310
Just one glass, but
Daddy did earn this.

05:47.714 --> 05:50.414
So, I have an idea because
I'm gonna be there early,

05:50.416 --> 05:53.282
I was thinking maybe we could
ride Mommy's horses together.

05:53.284 --> 05:54.885
Hello, Savanna.

05:57.623 --> 05:58.724
What the
fuck are you doing?

06:00.226 --> 06:02.428
Leave her alone!

06:03.996 --> 06:06.030
Hey, hey!

06:06.032 --> 06:08.232
Baby, run, baby!

06:08.234 --> 06:11.701
Run, baby!

06:11.703 --> 06:12.571
Baby, baby!

06:26.217 --> 06:28.487
What, who are you?

06:30.054 --> 06:31.823
It's your move, David.

06:36.395 --> 06:38.397
No, hey,
don't hang up on me.

06:40.132 --> 06:40.967
Hey, hey!

06:43.635 --> 06:46.902
911, what's
the nature of your emergency?

06:46.904 --> 06:49.272
I witnessed an attack on
my wife and my daughter.

06:49.274 --> 06:50.941
I think he has them both.

06:50.943 --> 06:51.642
I don't know what to do.

06:51.644 --> 06:52.609
It's on route.

06:52.611 --> 06:54.044
Now you need to tell me where...

06:54.046 --> 06:55.277
I don't know, I don't know.

06:55.279 --> 06:57.015
She's in Mexico, please,
I just need some help.

06:58.416 --> 07:00.984
I'm sorry, sir,
where did you say they are?

07:00.986 --> 07:01.818
Mexico.

07:01.820 --> 07:02.852
Mexico, Baja.

07:02.854 --> 07:05.155
Okay,
sir, what's your name?

07:05.157 --> 07:06.455
David Miller, David.

07:06.457 --> 07:08.258
I'm not
quite sure I understand.

07:08.260 --> 07:10.460
How were you able to
witness the attack

07:10.462 --> 07:13.496
- if it happened in Mexico?
- I was on a video call.

07:13.498 --> 07:15.297
I saw everything, I saw them.

07:15.299 --> 07:16.999
He hit my wife and I
think he has my daughter.

07:17.001 --> 07:20.270
So, you
saw all of this online?

07:20.272 --> 07:21.905
Yes.

07:21.907 --> 07:22.938
Okay, sir.

07:22.940 --> 07:24.075
When the officers arrive,

07:24.077 --> 07:27.677
I will need you to explain
all of this to them, okay?

07:27.679 --> 07:28.845
Okay, thank you very much.

07:28.847 --> 07:30.414
Please get them here
as soon as you can.

07:30.416 --> 07:33.316
David, the
officers will be there shortly.

07:33.318 --> 07:34.454
Thank you.

07:37.255 --> 07:38.556
Oh, god.

07:38.558 --> 07:40.256
God.

07:45.164 --> 07:46.229
David Miller?

07:46.231 --> 07:47.498
Yes.

07:47.500 --> 07:48.297
We received
a report of an attack.

07:48.299 --> 07:49.498
That's right.

07:49.500 --> 07:50.301
Sir, can we come in?

07:50.303 --> 07:52.872
Please do.

07:54.039 --> 07:56.306
Do you mind
if we take a look around?

07:56.308 --> 07:58.010
Yeah, help yourself.

08:01.681 --> 08:03.246
You told the 911 operator

08:03.248 --> 08:04.847
you witnessed your
wife being attacked?

08:04.849 --> 08:07.818
Yes, she's in Mexico,
was in her parents'.

08:07.820 --> 08:09.789
I saw an attack, it
was a video call.

08:10.789 --> 08:13.356
Do you
mind if I check you?

08:13.358 --> 08:15.224
Of course you can,
but is that necessary?

08:15.226 --> 08:16.359
Just procedure, sir.

08:16.361 --> 08:18.328
Put your hands behind
your back for me.

08:18.330 --> 08:20.130
Spread your feet apart.

08:20.132 --> 08:20.900
A little wider.

08:21.801 --> 08:23.167
Lean back.

08:23.169 --> 08:26.472
So, this alleged attack that
you supposedly witnessed,

08:27.707 --> 08:30.340
how were you able to do that
since it took place in Mexico?

08:30.342 --> 08:31.441
I've already explained this.

08:31.443 --> 08:32.909
I was on a video call.

08:32.910 --> 08:34.277
The guy showed up and
hurt my wife and my child.

08:34.279 --> 08:35.477
I saw everything.

08:35.480 --> 08:37.482
Okay, so you saw this
attack on a video chat.

08:39.284 --> 08:40.086
Yes.

08:43.889 --> 08:46.889
Mr. Miller, would
you give me a moment?

08:46.891 --> 08:47.726
Of course.

08:49.160 --> 08:50.694
That's what happened, okay?

08:50.696 --> 08:52.428
I was on a video call.

08:52.430 --> 08:54.064
Dispatch, I'm with a gentleman

08:54.066 --> 08:56.398
who said he witnessed a 217.

08:56.400 --> 08:57.234
Copy that.

08:57.236 --> 08:58.301
Everything okay?

08:58.303 --> 08:59.469
Yeah.

08:59.471 --> 09:02.406
He said he witnessed the
attack via video chat.

09:02.408 --> 09:04.373
I'm
sorry, can you repeat?

09:04.375 --> 09:06.777
Witnessed attack
via video call.

09:06.779 --> 09:08.244
The attack happened in Mexico.

09:08.246 --> 09:09.713
I'm not exactly
sure how to proceed.

09:09.715 --> 09:11.415
Well,
let the gentleman know

09:11.417 --> 09:13.617
we'll have to send special
investigations tonight.

09:13.619 --> 09:15.551
There's really nothing
more we can do.

09:15.553 --> 09:16.521
Copy that.

09:19.958 --> 09:22.591
Mr. Miller, we're gonna
have to refer this

09:22.593 --> 09:24.326
to a different department.

09:24.328 --> 09:26.062
Someone will be
contacting you shortly.

09:26.064 --> 09:26.897
Someone?

09:26.899 --> 09:27.931
Who will call me?

09:27.933 --> 09:28.734
I'm sorry, sir.

09:29.668 --> 09:31.604
But someone will contact
you this evening.

09:33.337 --> 09:34.173
Okay.

09:35.240 --> 09:36.075
Let's go.

09:39.178 --> 09:41.177
I'm really sorry, sir.

09:41.179 --> 09:42.113
Thank you.

09:55.494 --> 09:59.095
Oh, god.

09:59.097 --> 10:00.964
Bella, where are you?

10:00.966 --> 10:04.301
At the apartment
waiting for Daddy to come.

10:04.303 --> 10:05.571
The police is here.

10:07.405 --> 10:09.541
Oh my god, David,
what's going on?

10:10.808 --> 10:13.042
Bella, do you know anything?

10:13.044 --> 10:14.143
No.

10:14.145 --> 10:15.345
There's police everywhere,

10:15.347 --> 10:18.581
and then they said that
there's a detective on his way.

10:20.052 --> 10:21.553
David, hold on a second.

10:26.191 --> 10:27.523
Okay.

10:39.904 --> 10:40.673
I'm Ana.

10:42.441 --> 10:43.609
Isabel is my sister.

10:45.476 --> 10:47.679
David, can you hold
on a second, please?

10:48.646 --> 10:51.514
I have my brother-in-law
on the phone.

10:51.516 --> 10:52.751
He witnesses the attack.

10:57.456 --> 10:58.591
Can I speak with him?

11:00.893 --> 11:03.162
David, I'm just
gonna pass it on, okay?

11:04.295 --> 11:05.130
Sure.

11:08.433 --> 11:10.532
Hey, I may want to
ask you a few questions

11:10.534 --> 11:12.771
- when I'm finished, please.
- Sure.

11:13.805 --> 11:17.608
Mr. Miller, this
is Detective Romero.

11:17.610 --> 11:19.609
Were you on the
phone with your wife?

11:19.611 --> 11:22.646
Not on the phone, I was on
my laptop on a video call.

11:22.648 --> 11:24.279
I saw everything.

11:24.281 --> 11:25.883
You saw the attacker?

11:25.885 --> 11:27.584
Detective, I'm happy
to answer your questions,

11:27.586 --> 11:30.019
but please can you tell
me, is my family okay?

11:30.021 --> 11:33.156
Your wife and daughter
are not in the apartment.

11:33.158 --> 11:34.590
There's no blood.

11:34.592 --> 11:36.325
No sign of forced entry.

11:36.327 --> 11:38.461
The bags, they are still here.

11:38.463 --> 11:40.497
It wasn't a robbery.

11:40.499 --> 11:41.797
At this point,

11:41.799 --> 11:43.599
it leads me to believe
that it was a kidnapping,

11:43.601 --> 11:46.168
in which case they will
have to be kept alive

11:46.170 --> 11:49.037
because it becomes a
business transaction.

11:49.039 --> 11:50.907
What do you mean a transaction,
business transaction?

11:50.909 --> 11:52.274
I saw him beat my wife
until she couldn't...

11:52.276 --> 11:56.046
I understand what you must
be going through right now,

11:56.048 --> 12:00.149
and I need to know
when you will get here.

12:00.151 --> 12:03.019
It will be very important for
you to be here in country.

12:03.021 --> 12:05.354
I already booked my
flight, American Airlines,

12:05.356 --> 12:07.056
it leaves in the morning.

12:07.058 --> 12:08.959
I'll be there at
2:00 p.m.local time.

12:08.961 --> 12:10.426
I'm going to give
you my cell number.

12:10.428 --> 12:13.397
I want you to call me the
moment you will land, please.

12:13.399 --> 12:14.596
I'll be there
in the afternoon.

12:14.598 --> 12:16.034
I'll call you as
soon as I get there.

13:44.622 --> 13:45.955
Hello?

13:45.957 --> 13:47.490
Yeah, detective, it's
David, I just got here.

13:47.492 --> 13:49.192
Oh, good, can I
send a car to collect you?

13:49.194 --> 13:50.659
No, no, I'm good.

13:50.661 --> 13:51.827
I just jumped in a cab.

13:51.829 --> 13:53.028
I'm gonna head straight
to the apartment.

13:53.030 --> 13:54.465
I'll call you as
soon as I get there.

13:54.467 --> 13:55.965
No,
no, no, you can't.

13:55.967 --> 13:56.666
Hello?

13:56.668 --> 13:57.436
David?

13:59.638 --> 14:01.171
Where are we headed, sir?

14:01.173 --> 14:04.076
Sir, yeah, 550 Masaique,
por favor, thank you.

14:05.476 --> 14:06.812
You here on business?

14:08.013 --> 14:09.144
No.

14:09.146 --> 14:10.446
Well, if you're
here on vacation,

14:10.448 --> 14:12.849
I know a couple of spots
with some beautiful women.

14:15.821 --> 14:17.220
I'm actually here to
see my family, thank you.

14:18.524 --> 14:19.855
Well, if you need
anything, you know, just...

14:19.857 --> 14:21.124
Excuse me, I got a call.

14:21.126 --> 14:21.858
- Hello.
- David,

14:21.860 --> 14:23.226
you can't go to the apartment.

14:23.228 --> 14:24.426
It's a crime scene.

14:24.428 --> 14:25.928
Detective, I'm going straight
to the apartment, okay?

14:25.930 --> 14:28.731
I need answers and I need to
see this for myself, okay?

14:28.733 --> 14:30.233
Please, come to the precinct.

14:30.235 --> 14:32.772
I know you want answers, and
we can go over stuff here.

14:34.505 --> 14:36.505
Do you have the address?

14:36.507 --> 14:37.907
Yeah, I know, I have it.

14:37.909 --> 14:39.245
Central District, right?

14:40.145 --> 14:41.244
- Senor?
- Yeah?

14:41.246 --> 14:42.711
The police station in
the Central District,

14:42.713 --> 14:43.946
- do you know where that is?
- Yeah.

14:43.948 --> 14:46.316
- Can we go there, please?
- Yeah.

14:46.318 --> 14:48.719
I'll be there
as soon as I can.

14:48.721 --> 14:50.923
Great, I'll see you here.

15:24.088 --> 15:26.124
Mr. Miller, I'm
Detective Romero.

15:26.991 --> 15:28.724
It's good to meet you, sir.

15:28.726 --> 15:30.893
I wish it was under
different circumstances.

15:30.895 --> 15:32.862
- Of course.
- Please.

15:32.864 --> 15:36.965
Thank you.

15:52.584 --> 15:53.918
David, please.

15:59.857 --> 16:02.126
- Is here okay?
- Yes, right there, please.

16:09.000 --> 16:10.269
How was your journey?

16:15.140 --> 16:15.975
Long.

16:18.976 --> 16:21.445
Can I get you
something to drink?

16:21.447 --> 16:22.644
Water or coffee?

16:22.646 --> 16:24.247
Actually, I'm okay, thank you.

16:24.249 --> 16:27.417
Truth is, I'd rather
just get on with things,

16:27.419 --> 16:28.484
if that's okay.

16:28.486 --> 16:29.819
I wondered if there was
any more information,

16:29.821 --> 16:31.257
news, leads, anything?

16:37.629 --> 16:42.532
Not yet, but we're doing the
forensics on the crime scene

16:42.534 --> 16:44.403
and that should come in shortly.

16:45.437 --> 16:50.643
David, I want you
to tell me again

16:51.809 --> 16:52.944
the first thing
that you remember.

16:57.348 --> 16:58.182
His voice.

17:48.232 --> 17:51.534
So, is it normal for a kidnapper

17:51.536 --> 17:54.503
to take a woman and a child,
beat them half to death?

17:54.505 --> 17:57.275
I mean, what use are they
to anybody if they're dead?

17:59.643 --> 18:01.578
- Is it normal?
- At times, yes.

18:01.580 --> 18:02.648
To prevent resistance.

18:03.916 --> 18:06.116
You know how many ransom
kidnappings we have here?

18:06.118 --> 18:09.051
We have a lot more experience
at this than you do, David.

18:09.053 --> 18:10.219
Now, you're very upset.

18:10.221 --> 18:12.357
Please, try to sit
down and relax, please.

18:21.967 --> 18:26.371
It's just the way
he looked at me.

18:31.776 --> 18:32.643
With such hatred.

18:34.912 --> 18:36.748
He knew me, he knew my name.

18:39.117 --> 18:40.319
It felt so personal.

18:41.519 --> 18:45.155
It was as if he was enjoying
some kind of sick game,

18:45.157 --> 18:46.656
like a challenge.

18:46.658 --> 18:50.059
You wife is the daughter of
a very wealthy businessman.

18:50.061 --> 18:51.530
She's a national treasure.

18:52.863 --> 18:54.132
High profile and money.

18:55.033 --> 18:57.803
This is a kidnapper's
dream, David.

19:01.640 --> 19:06.109
So, there are some procedural
things that are left to do,

19:06.111 --> 19:08.610
about an hour or so, so
while we prepare those,

19:08.612 --> 19:09.680
please go get some air.

19:10.649 --> 19:13.882
It's been a very long
day for you, okay?

19:13.884 --> 19:15.520
I think we've done
enough for now.

19:18.923 --> 19:19.757
10 minutes?

19:20.793 --> 19:21.627
Yeah, perfect.

19:23.160 --> 19:24.994
Yeah, same place.

19:25.831 --> 19:26.765
Okay, great, thanks.

19:33.871 --> 19:36.872
David, I want
you to have this.

19:36.874 --> 19:41.579
It's a local phone with all
the numbers, my contacts.

19:42.813 --> 19:46.049
I wanna be able to reach you
immediately for something.

19:46.051 --> 19:47.419
Okay, wonderful, thank you.

19:49.321 --> 19:50.986
Do you need a ride?

19:50.988 --> 19:52.123
Cab's on the way.

19:55.927 --> 19:57.193
Thank you, detective.

19:57.195 --> 20:00.161
Thank you very much.

20:00.163 --> 20:01.799
We'll find them.

20:04.101 --> 20:05.403
Good night.

20:42.005 --> 20:43.505
Hey, you sure you
wanna stay here?

20:43.507 --> 20:46.109
It's no good here,
man, it's dangerous.

20:46.111 --> 20:47.676
Looks perfect.

20:47.678 --> 20:48.780
But thanks, huh?

20:49.647 --> 20:50.482
Keep it.

22:52.403 --> 22:54.704
Hey, thanks for
getting my stuff, huh?

22:54.706 --> 22:55.540
Hey, no problem.

22:56.807 --> 23:00.342
We hadn't heard from you
in hours and got worried.

23:00.344 --> 23:03.780
I'm sorry, I just lost
track of time, that's all.

23:03.782 --> 23:06.349
Did the detective call you?

23:06.351 --> 23:09.484
- No, I called him.
- Okay.

23:09.486 --> 23:11.353
He told me you left
your stuff at the station

23:11.355 --> 23:15.090
and he gave me this
number to reach you.

23:15.092 --> 23:17.060
Okay, thanks.

23:17.062 --> 23:21.930
David, are you sure you
don't wanna stay with us?

23:21.932 --> 23:23.366
Yeah, I'm okay.

23:23.368 --> 23:25.337
- You know how your father is.
- Yeah.

23:31.376 --> 23:33.312
David, what exactly happened?

23:36.180 --> 23:37.279
He hurt her.

23:37.281 --> 23:38.317
He hurt her badly.

23:41.284 --> 23:43.088
I don't even know
if he has my baby.

23:48.492 --> 23:50.225
Is there anything in her
life before I met her

23:50.227 --> 23:51.794
that you guys didn't
tell me about?

23:51.796 --> 23:52.530
Anything at all?

23:54.431 --> 23:58.801
David, before she met
you, her life was riding.

23:58.803 --> 24:02.506
I mean, after winning
the gold at the Olympics.

24:03.608 --> 24:06.274
What about, I don't
know, ex-boyfriends,

24:06.276 --> 24:08.412
stalkers, fans, anything?

24:09.280 --> 24:12.615
No, not that I remember.

24:12.617 --> 24:15.984
I mean, just typical fans

24:15.986 --> 24:20.356
and people who were
inspired by her and...

24:20.358 --> 24:23.361
I know.

24:30.133 --> 24:30.901
Wait.

24:32.003 --> 24:35.073
We still have boxes of
fan letters at home.

24:37.609 --> 24:39.010
Well, can we get them?

24:43.046 --> 24:43.881
Sure.

25:27.324 --> 25:29.358
Hi, there, do you
have a room, please?

25:46.310 --> 25:47.145
Thank you.

25:50.348 --> 25:52.482
If
you need any company.

25:52.484 --> 25:53.983
Have a good night.

25:53.985 --> 25:54.753
Which way?

25:55.453 --> 25:56.488
Thank you.

28:30.542 --> 28:32.611
Mommy and Daddy don't
care about you anymore.

28:42.620 --> 28:44.019
You're okay now.

28:48.758 --> 28:50.761
Why are you afraid of me?

29:05.476 --> 29:08.279
For that, you don't get.

29:12.684 --> 29:15.685
A good parent knows what to do.

31:16.974 --> 31:18.407
Oh, my god.

31:18.409 --> 31:19.244
Oh, my god.

33:19.863 --> 33:22.330
Can I come in?

33:22.332 --> 33:23.101
Of course, sir.

33:40.685 --> 33:42.086
What are you doing, David?

33:53.898 --> 33:57.800
How is all this helping?

33:57.802 --> 33:59.137
I don't know if it is.

34:01.773 --> 34:02.940
What do you mean?

34:06.909 --> 34:08.079
I gotta do something.

34:12.215 --> 34:13.550
It wasn't a kidnapping.

34:17.887 --> 34:19.322
How can you be so sure?

34:23.994 --> 34:26.030
The way he hurt her.

34:29.434 --> 34:34.304
He hurt her so bad.

34:35.206 --> 34:36.440
You know my family.

34:38.876 --> 34:40.110
We love you.

34:41.010 --> 34:43.014
- You are like a son for...
- I know that.

34:44.847 --> 34:46.050
I know that.

34:53.322 --> 34:54.157
Do you?

34:58.796 --> 35:00.164
Do you think they are,

35:01.932 --> 35:03.434
do you think they
are still alive?

35:07.405 --> 35:10.073
I don't know.

35:19.650 --> 35:23.755
I gave her one like this
the first time she competed.

35:27.858 --> 35:29.526
She's my baby, David.

35:34.932 --> 35:35.800
If you find him,

35:38.836 --> 35:40.071
you tell me.

35:43.472 --> 35:46.807
You know I've always
admired you as a father.

35:46.809 --> 35:48.111
The way you supported her.

35:50.180 --> 35:51.215
You find him,

35:54.184 --> 35:58.355
you kill him.

35:59.789 --> 36:01.224
I never see my baby again.

36:09.566 --> 36:10.400
Good luck, son.

36:26.050 --> 36:27.182
Detective,
this is David.

36:27.184 --> 36:28.316
I've been tryin' to
reach you all night.

36:28.318 --> 36:29.517
I've got some
important information.

36:29.519 --> 36:31.119
Meet me at address
1504 Tropanic.

36:31.121 --> 36:32.153
I'll be there in a few hours.

36:32.155 --> 36:34.490
Please, be there.

37:21.704 --> 37:25.073
Gerardo, can we go
to 1503 Agua Caliente?

37:37.086 --> 37:39.157
Hello, ma'am,
I'm Detective Romero.

37:40.291 --> 37:41.555
- Is there something wrong?
- No, nothing wrong.

37:41.557 --> 37:47.195
I just need to ask
you, did you recently.

37:47.197 --> 37:50.600
I'll be right there.

37:57.441 --> 37:58.809
David, why are we here?

38:04.081 --> 38:04.916
It's him.

38:10.854 --> 38:13.690
You can't be running your
own investigation in my city.

38:14.892 --> 38:17.528
I want you to go across
the street and wait for me.

38:18.996 --> 38:19.829
You understand?

38:25.401 --> 38:26.871
Make sure he stays there.

38:28.005 --> 38:31.309
Shit.

38:33.809 --> 38:36.178
Oh, please, please,
thank you very much.

38:36.180 --> 38:37.515
- Of course.
- Come in.

38:39.483 --> 38:42.084
Oh, would you please sit down?

38:42.086 --> 38:43.654
Make yourself at home.

38:49.093 --> 38:51.760
Would you like a cup
of coffee, water?

38:51.762 --> 38:52.660
- No.
- No?

38:52.662 --> 38:54.595
- That's very kind.
- So, so?

38:54.597 --> 38:59.066
I just have some questions,
routine questions to ask you.

38:59.068 --> 39:00.234
Oh.

39:00.236 --> 39:02.269
Your name
is Mrs. Perez, yes?

39:02.271 --> 39:04.574
Yes, but call me Alma.

39:05.374 --> 39:07.575
- Alma.
- Alma, yes.

39:13.450 --> 39:15.253
Do you recognize this man?

39:16.186 --> 39:18.856
Oh, let me get
my glasses, please.

39:21.825 --> 39:23.427
I always put them here.

39:25.195 --> 39:27.528
Oh, my god.

39:27.530 --> 39:32.033
Okay, would you show
it to me again, please?

39:32.035 --> 39:33.303
- Yes.
- Thank you.

39:35.072 --> 39:38.409
Ah, it's my Gabriel.

39:39.242 --> 39:40.140
Your Gabriel?

39:40.142 --> 39:41.811
I am his grandmother.

39:43.180 --> 39:45.616
But is he okay?

39:47.985 --> 39:49.184
Oh, yes, yes.

39:49.186 --> 39:51.555
- Yes?
- Yes, don't worry, he's fine.

39:58.427 --> 39:59.929
Did he ever live with you?

40:00.898 --> 40:04.999
Yes, yes, a long time.

40:05.001 --> 40:09.269
When was the
last time that you saw him?

40:10.374 --> 40:12.776
A long time ago, detective.

40:14.077 --> 40:14.912
Too long.

40:17.247 --> 40:21.015
Can you
recognize this girl?

40:21.017 --> 40:25.856
Mm, oh yes, I remember her.

40:26.624 --> 40:29.323
She's a real talent, isn't she?

40:29.325 --> 40:30.327
Mm-hmm.

40:31.327 --> 40:34.898
My Gabriel used to
have such a crush on her.

40:36.198 --> 40:38.401
I understand those things.

40:40.271 --> 40:42.539
Can you show me his room?

40:45.809 --> 40:46.644
Yes.

41:03.559 --> 41:07.364
Well, here we are.

41:09.099 --> 41:14.001
I haven't been able to move
anything around his bedroom.

41:14.003 --> 41:16.539
You know, it's.

41:17.740 --> 41:22.044
He has a lot of
pictures of Isabel.

41:22.046 --> 41:27.881
She was a real godsend
after the big tragedy, and...

41:27.883 --> 41:28.718
A tragedy?

41:32.889 --> 41:33.724
Oh.

41:35.258 --> 41:36.626
It was so sad.

41:37.827 --> 41:42.030
My daughter and his father
were killed in a fire.

41:42.032 --> 41:47.135
And that little boy,
so quiet, so sweet,

41:47.137 --> 41:48.738
- he came to live here...
- Can I?

41:51.006 --> 41:54.845
Is there a way, do you
know how I can contact him?

41:58.715 --> 42:03.086
I think he works in a
big company consulting firm

42:04.954 --> 42:05.789
in the city.

42:15.231 --> 42:17.899
- Good morning.
- Hello, there.

42:17.901 --> 42:18.765
How was your trip?

42:18.767 --> 42:23.104
It was productive.

42:23.106 --> 42:26.374
And it's true what they say.

42:26.376 --> 42:29.611
That city really never sleeps.

42:31.414 --> 42:33.050
Oh, your grandmother called.

42:36.919 --> 42:39.023
- Is she okay?
- Yeah, she seemed fine.

42:40.256 --> 42:42.057
All right.

42:42.059 --> 42:43.191
I'll call her later.

42:43.193 --> 42:45.459
- Don't let me forget.
- I won't.

42:45.461 --> 42:47.195
You have a meeting at 11:00
a.m. with Mr. Stevens.

42:47.197 --> 42:50.097
He wants to know what's going
on with the Anderson deal.

42:50.099 --> 42:53.535
And Mr. Thompson from KDR
should be calling in soon.

42:53.537 --> 42:56.137
Well, thank you, Liliana.

42:56.139 --> 42:58.841
You're welcome.

43:05.381 --> 43:06.515
KMI, Mr. Sanchez office.

43:06.517 --> 43:07.814
How can I help you?

43:07.816 --> 43:09.783
Hello, this
is Detective Romero.

43:09.785 --> 43:13.019
Oh, hi, detective,
how can I help you?

43:13.021 --> 43:15.689
Look, I was looking
at your investment plan,

43:15.691 --> 43:16.658
and I have to...

43:16.660 --> 43:18.526
I'm so sorry, sir.

43:18.528 --> 43:20.164
Can you please
give me one second?

43:21.298 --> 43:22.965
I'm assuming it must be urgent?

43:22.967 --> 43:25.066
There's a Detective
Romero on the other line,

43:25.068 --> 43:26.934
and he says it's ve...

43:26.936 --> 43:27.704
Who?

43:33.242 --> 43:34.077
Okay.

43:37.314 --> 43:38.379
Put him through.

44:27.697 --> 44:29.732
Please, sit down.

44:41.477 --> 44:43.977
- I wanna thank you for coming
- Not a problem.

44:43.979 --> 44:46.983
I was just curious as to
what this was concerning?

44:49.418 --> 44:52.586
Do you know Isabel Miller?

44:52.588 --> 44:53.588
Miller?

44:53.590 --> 44:55.092
Isabel Miller?

44:56.660 --> 44:59.263
Sorry, I don't
recognize the name.

45:12.474 --> 45:14.978
I haven't seen this
picture in ages.

45:16.814 --> 45:18.412
You recognize her?

45:18.414 --> 45:19.682
You mean Isabel Barabas.

45:21.651 --> 45:25.452
Of course I know Isabel Barabas.

45:25.454 --> 45:27.254
- Doesn't everybody?
- Hm.

45:27.256 --> 45:31.024
Now, I remember the
day she won the gold.

45:31.026 --> 45:34.461
When it was announced,
the room exploded.

45:35.499 --> 45:36.800
You remember that
day, don't you?

45:39.269 --> 45:42.602
Other than that, what was
your relationship with her?

45:42.604 --> 45:45.874
Oh, there was no
real relationship.

45:45.876 --> 45:48.946
I was more of a fan growing up.

45:50.947 --> 45:52.046
I know.

45:52.048 --> 45:53.950
I've been to your
grandmother's house.

45:55.785 --> 45:56.820
You got me.

45:57.621 --> 45:58.822
I was a big fan.

46:00.423 --> 46:02.159
She's the reason
I started riding.

46:03.293 --> 46:08.329
Was there any other contact
that you made with her?

46:08.331 --> 46:10.030
Recently?

46:10.032 --> 46:10.800
No.

46:13.470 --> 46:14.672
What is this concerning?

46:15.505 --> 46:17.106
Did something happen to her?

46:19.776 --> 46:21.075
Three days ago

46:21.077 --> 46:22.880
Isabel Miller and her
daughter were attacked.

46:24.981 --> 46:26.784
They've been missing ever since.

46:28.985 --> 46:29.820
My god,

46:31.622 --> 46:32.856
that's awful.

46:34.756 --> 46:36.057
Where were you two nights ago?

46:36.059 --> 46:39.026
I was on my way to
New York on business.

46:39.028 --> 46:42.430
- Can anyone corroborate this?
- Of course.

46:42.432 --> 46:43.965
Just check with my assistant.

46:43.967 --> 46:47.001
She took care of all
the arrangements for me.

46:47.003 --> 46:49.405
I stayed at the West
Hotel, give them a call.

46:50.539 --> 46:52.709
Ah, it's Liliana, correct?

46:55.512 --> 46:57.314
Yes, Liliana.

47:01.852 --> 47:03.218
You know, I hope
you understand

47:03.220 --> 47:07.722
that until we can
verify this information

47:07.724 --> 47:10.591
that I need you to
remain in the country.

47:10.593 --> 47:12.296
Thank you for the cooperation.

47:15.631 --> 47:16.467
Not a problem.

47:20.570 --> 47:21.903
You're free to go.

47:21.905 --> 47:22.736
What do you mean free to go?

47:22.738 --> 47:23.671
Hey, hey!

47:23.673 --> 47:25.273
Hold on, hold on.

47:25.275 --> 47:26.043
Cool, man.

47:27.477 --> 47:28.475
Who is this guy?

47:28.477 --> 47:29.711
What do you mean, who is this,

47:29.713 --> 47:30.745
you know exactly
who the fuck I am!

47:32.816 --> 47:33.884
Get him out of here.

47:35.084 --> 47:37.651
- What's wrong with you?
- That was him.

47:37.653 --> 47:38.753
I swear to god that was him.

47:38.755 --> 47:39.820
You saw
him on a video call.

47:39.822 --> 47:40.754
That's him.

47:40.756 --> 47:41.992
You saw him on a video call.

47:43.226 --> 47:47.995
I'm trying to build a case,
okay, I need proof, facts.

47:47.997 --> 47:52.700
If his alibi checks
out, we have nothing.

47:52.702 --> 47:53.700
What do you mean nothing?

47:53.702 --> 47:55.139
We're talkin' about my family.

47:56.905 --> 47:58.007
You understand me?

47:59.342 --> 48:00.443
I have two daughters.

48:01.945 --> 48:03.912
I understand what you
must be going through.

48:03.914 --> 48:05.381
No, you don't.

48:06.715 --> 48:09.085
- I need more time.
- Time.

48:09.918 --> 48:12.789
How much more time do they have?

48:15.758 --> 48:17.093
Can I leave now?

48:23.965 --> 48:26.235
You know how to reach me.

49:07.776 --> 49:10.414
Mr. Sanchez,
everything okay?

49:12.548 --> 49:14.582
Yeah, I'm fine.

49:14.584 --> 49:17.017
Just a stupid mistake.

49:17.019 --> 49:20.220
I was changing the
spark plugs in my car,

49:20.222 --> 49:23.358
and I didn't realize,
pulled back, hit my hand,

49:23.360 --> 49:24.327
and that was it.

52:13.229 --> 52:15.365
Who do you think
you are, Mr. Gringo?

53:15.992 --> 53:17.861
Where's my family?

53:19.028 --> 53:20.026
Where are they?

54:28.965 --> 54:30.667
You're safe now.

54:34.938 --> 54:37.273
I'll never let him hurt you.

54:49.352 --> 54:51.388
It's okay, my darling.

55:08.972 --> 55:10.573
Where's my child?

55:15.077 --> 55:16.378
She's dead.

55:34.063 --> 55:35.262
What do you expect me to do?

55:35.264 --> 55:36.195
- He has my family!
- I expect you

55:36.197 --> 55:38.066
to stay away from my case.

55:38.068 --> 55:39.236
I warned you, David.

55:40.669 --> 55:41.568
I saw him.

55:41.570 --> 55:42.338
And he ran.

55:43.372 --> 55:45.939
A man accused of
kidnapping your family

55:45.941 --> 55:47.343
sees a crazy man come at him.

55:48.244 --> 55:49.312
Who wouldn't run?

55:51.581 --> 55:53.849
I've been doing this
for 35 years, David.

55:55.217 --> 55:57.084
Do you know what it
takes to make a good case

55:57.086 --> 55:57.854
in this system?

55:58.954 --> 56:01.254
So the murderer doesn't
walk out of the courtroom

56:01.256 --> 56:03.392
sticking his middle
finger up at me?

56:04.392 --> 56:05.992
When I don't have to
look into the faces

56:05.994 --> 56:07.128
of the victim's family

56:07.130 --> 56:09.365
because I failed to
bring them justice?

56:10.599 --> 56:16.236
I broke promises to children
because I acted with instinct

56:16.238 --> 56:17.273
and not enough evidence.

56:18.207 --> 56:19.506
And now you're
getting in the way

56:19.508 --> 56:22.441
of me gathering my evidence,
finding your family...

56:22.443 --> 56:25.914
What do you think
I'm trying to do, huh?

56:27.483 --> 56:28.885
I don't wanna lose them.

56:31.086 --> 56:32.488
I don't wanna lose them.

56:34.856 --> 56:35.691
That's all.

56:36.791 --> 56:37.626
That's all.

56:40.195 --> 56:41.730
For the last time, David,

56:42.697 --> 56:44.700
you have to stay
away from the case.

56:45.867 --> 56:46.769
I give you two choices.

56:48.171 --> 56:51.338
You leave Mexico or you're
gonna spend the rest of the time

56:51.340 --> 56:52.305
in one of my cells.

56:52.307 --> 56:53.075
You choose.

56:58.280 --> 57:01.381
It's just that every
minute feels like an hour

57:01.383 --> 57:03.019
and I don't know what to do.

57:08.791 --> 57:10.356
I promise you,

57:10.358 --> 57:13.028
I'll do everything in my
power to find your family.

57:16.865 --> 57:17.666
Thank you.

57:19.001 --> 57:19.835
Thank you.

58:02.278 --> 58:03.113
I don't want any.

58:07.182 --> 58:08.016
Leave me alone.

58:09.517 --> 58:13.287
Honey, if you
talk without permission,

58:13.289 --> 58:14.524
I'll kill you.

58:40.081 --> 58:41.381
So you'll bring cash.

58:41.383 --> 58:42.316
Si, si.

58:42.318 --> 58:43.617
Tomorrow is fine.

58:43.619 --> 58:45.619
Tomorrow is fine, no problem.

58:45.621 --> 58:47.086
Where will you be?

58:47.088 --> 58:50.291
It's in a bar on the corner
of Revolution and Tercera.

58:50.293 --> 58:51.492
You must come alone.

58:51.494 --> 58:53.496
Uh-huh, I'll be
there, gracias.

59:17.253 --> 59:18.785
Morning.

59:18.787 --> 59:19.586
Just the
man I was looking for.

59:19.588 --> 59:21.454
Well, you found me.

59:21.456 --> 59:22.521
Question for you.

59:22.523 --> 59:24.992
Have you ever been
to my beach club?

59:24.994 --> 59:26.260
Sure.

59:26.262 --> 59:29.062
Charity event this weekend,
liquor company sponsoring,

59:29.064 --> 59:30.798
I'm hosting, are you in?

59:30.800 --> 59:32.265
Am I in?

59:32.267 --> 59:34.334
What kinda question is that?

59:34.336 --> 59:35.468
Of course I'm in.

59:35.470 --> 59:38.071
Booze, women, what
else can a man want?

59:38.073 --> 59:40.407
You are a wise man.

59:40.409 --> 59:41.975
Have your secretary
call me, okay?

59:41.977 --> 59:43.012
Already on it.

59:53.356 --> 59:54.421
Okay, gracias.

59:54.423 --> 59:55.191
Thank you.

01:00:24.320 --> 01:00:27.287
Yeah.

01:00:31.827 --> 01:00:34.130
- Gracias, senor.
- Gracias.

01:00:54.950 --> 01:00:55.851
Your Savanna,

01:00:58.655 --> 01:00:59.822
I spared her.

01:01:02.224 --> 01:01:06.061
But I needed to punish you.

01:01:08.798 --> 01:01:13.169
I waited for you
all these years.

01:01:14.470 --> 01:01:18.439
I knew one day the time
would be right for our love

01:01:18.441 --> 01:01:20.577
to fully blossom.

01:01:22.477 --> 01:01:26.715
And then you had to go
betray me with that man.

01:01:32.088 --> 01:01:33.586
I can take that mistake.

01:01:33.588 --> 01:01:35.691
We all make mistakes, but,

01:01:37.093 --> 01:01:41.664
but that child.

01:01:43.532 --> 01:01:47.769
I can't live with that
child in this world.

01:01:50.139 --> 01:01:50.974
A bastard.

01:02:06.488 --> 01:02:07.657
Thank you for coming.

01:02:10.892 --> 01:02:12.361
It's all there, $2,000.

01:02:44.693 --> 01:02:45.727
Thank you.

01:03:22.298 --> 01:03:23.800
We are closed, puto.

01:03:33.642 --> 01:03:34.744
Mr. Barabas.

01:03:37.512 --> 01:03:38.948
I did not know it was you.

01:03:42.550 --> 01:03:43.952
Could I get you a drink?

01:03:45.253 --> 01:03:46.686
Quite a mess, huh?

01:03:46.688 --> 01:03:47.390
Yeah.

01:03:48.657 --> 01:03:51.760
These two guys, man, they
busted in from nowhere.

01:03:54.764 --> 01:03:56.365
Did you see what happened?

01:03:57.566 --> 01:04:01.401
Yes, these two
guys, one gringo.

01:04:01.403 --> 01:04:02.334
Gringo?

01:04:02.336 --> 01:04:03.336
American?

01:04:03.338 --> 01:04:04.637
Yes.

01:04:04.639 --> 01:04:05.907
Bald head, tall?

01:04:09.677 --> 01:04:11.345
Si.

01:04:11.347 --> 01:04:12.515
Did you see the other one?

01:04:13.615 --> 01:04:16.385
He's a little
shorter, dark hair.

01:04:17.686 --> 01:04:18.887
Just wearing a suit.

01:04:19.988 --> 01:04:21.124
He's fucking crazy.

01:04:22.557 --> 01:04:24.258
Have you ever seen him before?

01:04:24.260 --> 01:04:25.227
No, sir.

01:04:27.128 --> 01:04:30.967
Next time you see
him, you call me.

01:04:38.608 --> 01:04:41.077
Is that clear?

01:04:42.410 --> 01:04:43.378
Yes, Mr. Barabas.

01:05:32.794 --> 01:05:34.227
Hello?

01:05:34.229 --> 01:05:35.595
Who's this?

01:05:35.597 --> 01:05:36.432
Gabriel?

01:05:38.401 --> 01:05:39.235
Who is this?

01:05:40.001 --> 01:05:41.903
You know who this is.

01:05:44.072 --> 01:05:45.207
What do you want?

01:05:47.642 --> 01:05:48.878
I want what's mine.

01:05:50.445 --> 01:05:51.279
What's yours?

01:05:54.684 --> 01:05:55.918
You got nothing.

01:05:59.655 --> 01:06:01.220
Do me a favor.

01:06:01.222 --> 01:06:03.691
Get up, look out the window,
and tell me what you see.

01:06:16.872 --> 01:06:20.941
I see your car
parked by my property.

01:06:20.943 --> 01:06:24.812
Maybe I should call the police.

01:06:24.814 --> 01:06:27.747
It's
too late for that.

01:06:56.744 --> 01:06:58.013
Peaceful, isn't it?

01:07:02.550 --> 01:07:03.552
Welcome to my house.

01:07:14.664 --> 01:07:18.267
So, you can't find my
daughter or my granddaughter.

01:07:20.468 --> 01:07:23.005
And now you can't
find my son-in-law.

01:07:26.909 --> 01:07:27.943
What's going on?

01:07:29.577 --> 01:07:31.010
Do you have anything?

01:07:31.012 --> 01:07:31.980
Any suspect?

01:07:33.782 --> 01:07:35.017
Possibly.

01:07:36.184 --> 01:07:38.286
We brought someone
in for questioning.

01:07:39.220 --> 01:07:40.956
You mean the local executive?

01:07:42.157 --> 01:07:46.091
Yes, but it appears he
was in New York at the time,

01:07:46.093 --> 01:07:48.762
and so far his alibi holds up.

01:07:48.764 --> 01:07:50.166
I don't care what it costs.

01:07:56.204 --> 01:08:01.343
Senor Barabas, there's been
no ransom request, no contact.

01:08:06.081 --> 01:08:08.184
I don't think this is
a kidnapping anymore.

01:08:13.787 --> 01:08:14.954
I'm gonna let you do your work

01:08:14.956 --> 01:08:17.192
because I know you're
gonna do your best.

01:08:19.995 --> 01:08:21.497
But if you don't find them

01:08:22.630 --> 01:08:25.267
because of something
that you didn't do...

01:08:56.964 --> 01:08:58.600
You got a broken heart, huh?

01:09:01.603 --> 01:09:06.037
You and me, this bottle of
wine, just the two of us.

01:09:06.040 --> 01:09:08.508
It doesn't get better
than that, does it?

01:09:08.510 --> 01:09:11.778
I'd be a bad host, wouldn't
I, if I didn't share it?

01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:06.235
Morning.

01:10:15.911 --> 01:10:17.146
Nice place.

01:10:19.747 --> 01:10:21.882
You know, see, I've
been thinking all night.

01:10:21.884 --> 01:10:24.487
You know the difference, I
think, between you and I?

01:10:26.521 --> 01:10:28.323
See, I think you wanna live more

01:10:29.991 --> 01:10:31.427
than you wanna see 'em again.

01:10:34.662 --> 01:10:35.563
You know, my wife?

01:10:36.365 --> 01:10:37.666
My beautiful daughter?

01:10:40.367 --> 01:10:43.138
See, now, me, I don't wanna
live another day if I don't.

01:10:48.977 --> 01:10:50.677
That's funny, huh?

01:10:54.549 --> 01:10:55.384
Okay.

01:10:59.921 --> 01:11:01.119
It's funny, huh?

01:11:02.223 --> 01:11:06.327
Where is my family, huh?

01:11:27.848 --> 01:11:30.249
Please.

01:11:30.251 --> 01:11:34.154
Please, baby.

01:11:34.156 --> 01:11:37.157
God,

01:11:37.159 --> 01:11:39.594
let me hear her voice.

01:11:41.830 --> 01:11:43.866
Just let Mommy know you're okay.

01:11:54.242 --> 01:11:58.246
Baby, please, let
me know you're okay.

01:12:02.951 --> 01:12:04.220
He won't hurt you.

01:12:04.952 --> 01:12:06.386
The bad man won't hurt you.

01:12:06.388 --> 01:12:08.591
Just let me know you're there.

01:12:10.959 --> 01:12:12.926
Just let me know you're okay.

01:12:17.631 --> 01:12:18.400
Savanna?

01:12:19.800 --> 01:12:21.467
Savanna?

01:12:21.469 --> 01:12:22.836
Savanna?

01:12:22.838 --> 01:12:23.606
Mommy's here.

01:12:26.707 --> 01:12:27.643
I'm here, baby.

01:12:30.210 --> 01:12:31.012
I'm here.

01:12:32.513 --> 01:12:34.315
Everything's gonna be okay.

01:12:55.036 --> 01:12:56.302
Is he in today?

01:12:56.304 --> 01:12:57.837
No, he hasn't arrived yet.

01:12:57.839 --> 01:12:59.506
Did he confirm for
Saturday's event?

01:12:59.508 --> 01:13:01.407
Yes, I already checked
in with your secretary.

01:13:01.409 --> 01:13:03.310
And I expect you
to be there, as well,

01:13:03.312 --> 01:13:04.711
looking beautiful as always?

01:13:05.647 --> 01:13:06.879
I'm looking
forward to it, sir.

01:13:06.881 --> 01:13:08.280
Okay.

01:13:09.918 --> 01:13:10.917
KMI, Mr. Sanchez office.

01:13:10.919 --> 01:13:11.985
How can I help you?

01:14:08.143 --> 01:14:11.711
I knew the first
time I saw her.

01:14:11.713 --> 01:14:15.683
I remember it so clearly.

01:14:16.851 --> 01:14:18.887
It was at a work
event, a horse show.

01:14:21.956 --> 01:14:23.491
She was the guest of honor.

01:14:25.360 --> 01:14:27.362
I didn't know
anything about horses.

01:14:30.531 --> 01:14:33.501
The way she rode this
powerful, magnificent animal.

01:14:37.171 --> 01:14:38.005
No fear.

01:14:41.343 --> 01:14:42.945
Just a smile, confident.

01:14:47.281 --> 01:14:48.516
She glowed.

01:14:57.692 --> 01:15:00.429
I spent the rest of the
afternoon trying to meet her.

01:15:06.902 --> 01:15:07.736
I shook her hand.

01:15:11.439 --> 01:15:12.473
We both knew.

01:15:13.308 --> 01:15:14.476
We both knew.

01:15:18.280 --> 01:15:19.113
We got married.

01:15:24.251 --> 01:15:25.454
She gave me a beautiful,

01:15:31.526 --> 01:15:32.693
beautiful daughter.

01:15:39.433 --> 01:15:44.003
I held her in my arms.

01:15:44.005 --> 01:15:48.443
I remember thinking, as long
as I'm here, she's safe.

01:15:49.677 --> 01:15:54.081
As long as I'm alive, nothing
will ever, ever happen to her.

01:15:58.286 --> 01:16:00.622
You sad fuck.

01:16:06.794 --> 01:16:10.566
I just want to know
where my family is.

01:16:22.343 --> 01:16:23.579
Please.

01:16:26.348 --> 01:16:28.082
You are pathetic.

01:17:18.832 --> 01:17:20.132
Gabriel,
it's Liliana.

01:17:20.134 --> 01:17:22.501
Just checking in to make
sure everything's okay.

01:17:22.503 --> 01:17:25.070
Also, wanted to remind
you about this weekend.

01:17:25.072 --> 01:17:27.606
I know you said you
wouldn't miss it.

01:17:27.608 --> 01:17:29.374
Oh, I had them send
you a hard copy invite,

01:17:29.376 --> 01:17:30.877
but call me back
when you get this.

01:17:30.879 --> 01:17:32.781
I have the details
for you, see ya.

01:18:00.174 --> 01:18:01.507
I love this movie.

01:18:06.548 --> 01:18:07.349
You awake?

01:18:09.116 --> 01:18:10.550
Seemed like you
needed some sleep,

01:18:10.552 --> 01:18:11.987
so I thought I'd let you rest.

01:18:14.488 --> 01:18:15.691
You seen this movie?

01:18:17.392 --> 01:18:18.626
Shame.

01:18:20.228 --> 01:18:23.165
Christopher Walken, man,
you gotta love that actor.

01:18:26.334 --> 01:18:27.699
Glad you're awake, though.

01:18:27.701 --> 01:18:29.170
Got a surprise for you.

01:18:42.383 --> 01:18:43.516
You know, you never know

01:18:43.518 --> 01:18:45.787
when a great idea
is gonna show up.

01:18:47.521 --> 01:18:48.756
You know?

01:18:50.659 --> 01:18:55.796
I was watching a movie, Deer
Hunter, boom, came to me.

01:18:57.831 --> 01:18:59.966
I mean, we all know movies
are bullshit, right?

01:18:59.968 --> 01:19:01.867
But, hey, De Niro is different.

01:19:01.869 --> 01:19:03.770
He wanted three rounds.

01:19:03.772 --> 01:19:05.107
Three rounds.

01:19:10.577 --> 01:19:12.714
You're wondering what's
inside the box, right?

01:19:16.384 --> 01:19:18.720
It's like Christmas, huh?

01:19:21.388 --> 01:19:22.857
We're gonna change the rules.

01:19:27.562 --> 01:19:28.660
We're gonna use one.

01:19:54.621 --> 01:19:57.092
You wanna tell me
something, hmm?

01:19:59.594 --> 01:20:01.092
No?

01:20:01.094 --> 01:20:01.862
Okay.

01:20:03.531 --> 01:20:07.233
Ready, one, two, three.

01:20:13.140 --> 01:20:14.875
What if the neighbors
had heard that?

01:20:16.576 --> 01:20:17.812
Wait there.

01:20:21.682 --> 01:20:22.718
I, I.

01:20:43.405 --> 01:20:45.771
Where's my family?

01:20:45.773 --> 01:20:47.776
I don't wanna die.

01:20:48.942 --> 01:20:50.745
So tell me where they are.

01:20:51.845 --> 01:20:53.848
I don't want to die.

01:20:57.919 --> 01:21:03.058
Because if I die, then I
can't look after my Isabel.

01:21:05.558 --> 01:21:06.793
Okay.

01:21:11.366 --> 01:21:16.371
One, two.

01:21:46.334 --> 01:21:48.303
You know, this
game we're playing,

01:21:53.374 --> 01:21:57.008
it's not as much fun as
I thought it would be.

01:21:57.010 --> 01:21:58.914
You know what I mean?

01:23:34.775 --> 01:23:35.943
Hello?

01:23:48.988 --> 01:23:51.190
This is Detective Romero.

01:23:51.192 --> 01:23:52.824
There have been some
new developments,

01:23:52.826 --> 01:23:55.127
and I need to ask
you a few questions.

01:23:55.129 --> 01:23:57.997
So, please, call back
as soon as possible.

01:24:39.941 --> 01:24:40.976
Hello, ma'am.

01:24:42.076 --> 01:24:45.613
Ma'am.

01:24:48.049 --> 01:24:49.780
I really need your help.

01:24:49.782 --> 01:24:51.283
This is really important.

01:24:51.285 --> 01:24:53.918
I'm looking for a guy
who's staying here.

01:24:53.920 --> 01:24:55.988
American, gringo, tall.

01:24:55.990 --> 01:24:57.392
Have you seen him at all?

01:24:58.325 --> 01:25:00.025
No, honey, I'm here every day.

01:25:00.027 --> 01:25:01.129
Haven't seen him.

01:25:05.599 --> 01:25:06.700
Wait, may I?

01:25:11.738 --> 01:25:13.407
Here, take my number.

01:25:14.375 --> 01:25:16.374
Can you please call
me if you see him?

01:25:16.376 --> 01:25:17.144
Any time?

01:25:18.579 --> 01:25:19.414
Take this.

01:25:22.482 --> 01:25:23.317
Thank you.

01:26:26.080 --> 01:26:28.450
You got an event
tomorrow night to go to.

01:26:36.089 --> 01:26:37.224
You're gonna be late.

01:26:45.967 --> 01:26:47.168
I want this to stop.

01:26:50.871 --> 01:26:52.206
Just tell me where they are.

01:26:53.206 --> 01:26:55.742
My family, where are they?

01:27:04.919 --> 01:27:06.752
Where is my fucking family?

01:27:06.754 --> 01:27:07.819
Where's my family?

01:27:07.821 --> 01:27:11.825
Kill me and you will
never see them again.

01:27:52.098 --> 01:27:53.899
I'm looking
for Gabriel Sanchez.

01:27:53.901 --> 01:27:56.635
When exactly was the last
time you spoke with him?

01:27:56.637 --> 01:27:58.870
Thursday right
before he headed home.

01:27:58.872 --> 01:28:01.507
Is it usual for
him to have a long weekend?

01:28:01.509 --> 01:28:03.945
No,
Gabriel is a workaholic.

01:28:07.247 --> 01:28:09.949
- Where did he go?
- New York.

01:28:09.951 --> 01:28:11.352
And how long was he there?

01:28:12.085 --> 01:28:13.353
Three days.

01:28:15.089 --> 01:28:15.924
Excuse me.

01:28:21.094 --> 01:28:23.095
You said Gabriel
Sanchez was in New York?

01:28:23.097 --> 01:28:24.264
How many days?

01:28:25.900 --> 01:28:27.669
And the hotel confirms this?

01:28:31.004 --> 01:28:32.437
Look, check with Immigration.

01:28:32.439 --> 01:28:34.509
I wanna know exactly
when he came back.

01:28:35.910 --> 01:28:40.145
I don't care it's three o'clock
in the morning, find out.

01:28:40.147 --> 01:28:41.216
Get back to me.

01:28:49.122 --> 01:28:49.957
Look at that.

01:28:52.293 --> 01:28:53.525
Outta smokes.

01:28:53.527 --> 01:28:58.365
And all you do is sleep.

01:29:03.269 --> 01:29:04.772
Now I gotta buy some more.

01:29:08.174 --> 01:29:09.276
You need anything?

01:29:30.897 --> 01:29:31.732
What?

01:29:33.968 --> 01:29:37.272
I want a group of tactical to
Sanchez's house immediately.

01:30:02.897 --> 01:30:04.663
His name is Gabriel Sanchez.

01:30:04.665 --> 01:30:06.965
He flew to New York,
checked into a hotel,

01:30:06.967 --> 01:30:09.437
and then turned around the
same day and came back.

01:30:11.604 --> 01:30:13.204
I'm on my way there right now.

01:30:13.206 --> 01:30:15.343
I've got a group of
tactical meeting me.

01:30:38.198 --> 01:30:39.864
I want a 25-mile radius.

01:30:39.866 --> 01:30:41.936
Road blocks, air
support, let's go.

01:31:25.713 --> 01:31:26.546
No!

01:31:28.448 --> 01:31:30.516
No more waiting

01:31:30.518 --> 01:31:32.684
- and waiting and waiting.
- Stop, stop!

01:31:32.686 --> 01:31:34.319
- Waiting and waiting.
- Please stop!

01:31:34.321 --> 01:31:38.090
Shut the fuck up!

01:31:38.092 --> 01:31:39.093
No more waiting.

01:31:40.661 --> 01:31:43.431
No more waiting,
no more waiting.

01:31:53.640 --> 01:31:55.207
- Say I love you!
- No!

01:31:55.209 --> 01:31:56.041
Say you're mine.

01:31:56.043 --> 01:31:57.411
Say I love you!

01:32:18.098 --> 01:32:19.898
Say I love you.

01:32:19.900 --> 01:32:23.400
Daddy, Daddy!

01:32:25.039 --> 01:32:26.672
Daddy!

01:32:26.674 --> 01:32:28.039
Daddy!

01:32:28.041 --> 01:32:28.809
Daddy!

01:32:33.880 --> 01:32:37.315
You will never get your
filthy hands on them,

01:32:37.317 --> 01:32:38.315
did you hear me?

01:32:38.317 --> 01:32:39.351
You hear me?

01:32:49.396 --> 01:32:50.231
Daddy.

01:35:10.638 --> 01:35:12.039
Remember this game we played?

01:35:16.543 --> 01:35:17.745
It was all about chance.

01:35:29.555 --> 01:35:30.989
Fuck chance.

01:35:39.902 --> 01:35:44.902
